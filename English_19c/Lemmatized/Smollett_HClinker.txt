RESPECTED
SIR
,
  	
<EOS>
I
have
receive
your
esteemed
favour
of
the
13th
ultimo
,
whereby
it
appeareth
,
that
you
have
peruse
those
same
Letters
,
the
which
be
deliver
unto
you
by
my
friend
the
reverend
Mr
Hugo
Behn
;
and
I
be
pleased
to
find
you
think
they
may
be
print
with
a
good
prospect
of
success
;
in
as
much
as
the
objection
you
mention
,
I
humbly
conceive
,
be
such
as
may
be
redargue
,
if
not
entirely
remove
  
and
,
first
,
in
the
first
place
,
as
touch
what
prosecution
may
arise
from
print
the
private
correspondence
of
person
still
live
,
give
me
leave
,
with
all
due
submission
,
to
observe
,
that
the
Letters
in
question
be
not
write
and
send
under
the
seal
of
secrecy
;
that
they
have
no
tendency
to
the
mala
fama
,
or
prejudice
of
any
person
whatsoever
;
but
rather
to
the
information
and
edification
of
mankind
:
so
that
it
becometh
a
sort
of
duty
to
promulgate
them
in
usum
publicum
.
<EOS>
besides
I
have
consult
Mr
Davy
Higgins
,
an
eminent
attorney
of
this
place
,
who
,
after
due
inspection
and
consideration
,
declareth
,
that
he
doth
not
think
the
say
letter
contain
any
matter
which
will
be
hold
actionable
in
the
eye
of
the
law
.
<EOS>
finally
,
if
you
and
I
should
come
to
a
right
understanding
,
I
do
declare
in
verbo
sacerdotis
,
that
in
case
of
any
such
prosecution
,
I
will
take
the
whole
upon
my
own
shoulder
,
even
quoad
fine
and
imprisonment
,
though
,
I
must
confess
<EOS>
,
I
should
not
care
to
undergo
flagellation
:
<EOS>
Tam
ad
turpitudinem
,
quam
ad
amaritudinem
poena
spectans
     
<EOS>
secondly
,
concern
the
personal
resentment
of
Mr
Justice
Lismahago
,
I
may
say
,
non
flocci
factio
     
<EOS>
I
would
not
willingly
vilipend
any
Christian
,
if
,
peradventure
,
he
deserveth
that
epithet
:
<EOS>
albeit
,
I
be
much
surprised
that
more
care
be
not
take
to
exclude
from
the
commission
<EOS>
all
such
vagrant
foreigner
as
may
be
justly
suspect
of
disaffection
to
our
happy
constitution
,
in
church
and
state
   
<EOS>
God
forbid
that
I
should
be
so
uncharitable
,
as
to
affirm
positively
,
that
the
say
Lismahago
be
no
well
than
a
Jesuit
in
disguise
;
but
<EOS>
this
I
will
assert
and
maintain
,
totis
viribus
,
that
,
from
the
day
he
qualify
,
he
have
never
be
once
see
intra
templi
paries
,
that
be
to
say
,
within
the
parish
church
.
      
<EOS>
thirdly
,
with
respect
to
what
pass
at
Mr
Kendal
's
table
,
when
the
say
Lismahago
be
so
brutal
in
his
reprehension
,
I
must
inform
you
,
my
good
sir
,
that
I
be
oblige
to
retire
,
not
by
fear
arise
from
his
minatory
reproach
,
which
,
as
I
say
above
,
I
value
not
of
a
rush
;
but
from
the
sudden
effect
produce
by
a
barbel
's
row
,
which
I
have
eat
at
dinner
,
not
know
,
that
the
say
row
be
at
certain
season
violently
cathartic
,
as
Galen
observeth
in
his
chapter
peri
ichtos
.
      
<EOS>
fourthly
,
and
lastly
,
with
reference
to
the
manner
in
which
I
get
possession
of
these
Letters
,
it
be
a
circumstance
that
concern
my
own
conscience
only
;
sufficeth
it
<EOS>
to
say
,
I
have
fully
satisfy
the
party
in
whose
custody
they
be
;
and
,
by
this
time
,
I
hope
I
have
also
satisfy
you
in
such
way
,
that
the
last
hand
may
be
put
to
our
agreement
,
and
the
work
proceed
with
all
convenient
expedition
;
in
which
hope
I
rest
,
      
respect
sir
,
your
very
humble
servant
,
      
Jonathan
Dustwich

<EOS>
PS

I

of

Sir
,
   
<EOS>
I
receive
yours
in
course
of
post
,
and
shall
be
glad
to
treat
with
you
for
the
MS
which
I
have
deliver
to
your
friend
Mr
Behn
;
but
can
by
no
means
comply
with
the
term
propose
.
<EOS>
those
thing
be
<EOS>
so
uncertain
 
Writing
be
all
a
lottery
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
a
loser
by
the
work
of
the
great
man
of
the
age
 
<EOS>
I
could
mention
particular
,
and
name
name
;
but
do
not
choose
it
 
<EOS>
the
taste
of
the
town
be
so
changeable
.
<EOS>
then
there
have
be
so
many
letter
upon
travel
lately
publish
 
<EOS>
what
between
Smollett
's
,
Sharp
's
,
Derrick
's
,
Thickness
's
,
Baltimore
's
,
and
Baretti
's
,
together
with
Shandy
's
Sentimental
Travels
,
the
public
seem
to
be
cloy
with
that
kind
of
entertainment
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
I
will
,
if
you
please
,
run
the
risque
of
printing
and
publishing
,
and
you
shall
have
half
the
profit
of
the
impression
 
You
need
not
take
the
trouble
to
bring
up
your
sermon
on
my
account
 
<EOS>
no
body
read
sermon
but
Methodists
and
Dissenters
 
<EOS>
besides
,
for
my
own
part
,
I
be
quite
a
stranger
to
that
sort
of
reading
;
and
the
two
person
,
whose
judgment
I
depend
upon
in
these
matter
,
be
out
of
the
way
;
one
be
go
abroad
,
carpenter
of
a
man
of
war
;
and
the
other
have
be
silly
enough
to
abscond
,
in
order
to
avoid
a
prosecution
for
blasphemy
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
great
loser
by
his
go
off
 
<EOS>
He
have
leave
a
manual
of
devotion
half
finish
on
my
hand
,
after
have
receive
money
for
the
whole
copy
 
<EOS>
He
be
the
soundest
divine
,
and
have
the
most
orthodox
pen
of
all
my
people
;
and
I
never
know
his
judgment
fail
,
but
in
fly
from
his
bread
and
butter
on
this
occasion
.
      
<EOS>
by
own
you
be
not
put
in
bodily
fear
by
Lismahago
,
you
preclude
yourself
from
the
benefit
of
a
good
plea
,
over
and
above
the
advantage
of
bind
him
over
.
<EOS>
in
the
late
war
,
I
insert
in
my
evening
paper
,
a
paragraph
that
come
by
the
post
,
reflect
upon
the
behaviour
of
a
certain
regiment
in
battle
.
<EOS>
an
officer
of
say
regiment
come
to
my
shop
,
and
,
in
the
presence
of
my
wife
and
journeyman
,
threaten
to
cut
off
my
ear
  
<EOS>
as
I
exhibit
mark
of
bodily
fear
,
more
way
than
one
,
to
the
conviction
of
the
bye
-
stander
,
I
bind
him
over
;
my
action
lie
,
and
I
recover
.
<EOS>
as
for
flagellation
,
you
have
nothing
to
fear
,
and
nothing
to
hope
,
on
that
head
 
there
have
be
but
one
printer
flog
at
the
cart
's
tail
these
thirty
year
;
that
be
Charles
Watson
;
and
he
assure
me
it
be
no
more
than
a
flea
-
bite
.

have
be
threaten
several
time
by
the
House

but

come
to
nothing
.
<EOS>
if
an
information
should
be
move
for
,
and
grant
against
you
,
as
the
editor
of
those
Letters
,
I
hope
you
will
have
honesty
and
wit
enough
to
appear
and
take
your
trial
 
if
you
should
be
sentence
to
the
pillory

<EOS>
dear

,
as
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
more
at
heart
than
to
convince
you
I
be
incapable
of
forget
,
or
neglect
the
friendship
I
make
at
college
<EOS>
,
I
now
begin
that
correspondence
by
letter
,
which
you
and
I
agree
,
at
parting
,
to
cultivate
.
<EOS>
I
begin
it
sooner
than
I
intend
,
that
you
may
have
it
in
your
power
to
refute
any
idle
report
which
may
be
circulate
to
my
prejudice
at
Oxford
,
touch
a
foolish
quarrel
,
in
which
I
have
be
involve
on
account
of
my
sister
,
who
have
be
some
time
settle
here
in
a
boarding
-
school
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
hither
with
my
uncle
and
aunt
(
who
be
our
guardian
)
to
fetch
her
away
,
I
find
her
a
fine
,
tall
girl
,
of
seventeen
,
with
an
agreeable
person
;
but
remarkably
simple
,
and
quite
ignorant
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
this
disposition
,
and
want
of
experience
,
have
expose
her
to
the
address
of
a
person
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
call
him
who
have
see
her
at
a
play
;
and
,
with
a
confidence
and
dexterity
peculiar
to
himself
,
find
mean
to
be
recommend
to
her
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
It
be
by
the
great
accident
I
intercept
one
of
his
letter
;
as
it
be
my
duty
to
stifle
this
correspondence
in
its
birth
,
I
make
it
my
business
to
find
him
out
,
and
tell
him
very
freely
my
sentiment
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
the
spark
do
not
like
the
stile
I
use
,
and
behave
with
abundance
of
mettle
.
<EOS>
though
his
rank
in
life
which
,
by
the
bye
,
I
be
ashamed
to
declare
)
do
not
entitle
him
to
much
deference
;
yet
as
his
behaviour
be
remarkably
spirit
,
I
admit
him
to
the
privilege
of
a
gentleman
,
and
something
may
have
happen
,
have
not
we
be
prevent
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
business
take
air
,
I
know
not
how
,
and
make
abundance
of
noise
 
recourse
be
have
to
justice
 
I
be
oblige
to
give
my
word
and
honour
,
&
c.
and
to

morrow
morning
<EOS>
we
set
out

Bristol
Wells

where
I
expect
to
hear
from
you
by
the
return
of
the
post
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
get
into
a
family
of
original

whom
I
may
one
day
attempt
to
describe
for
your
amusement

<EOS>
My
aunt
,
Mrs
Tabitha
Bramble
,
be
a
maiden
of
forty

five
,
exceedingly
starched
,
vain
,
and
ridiculous
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
be
an
odd
kind
of
humorist
,
always
on
the
fret
,
and
so
unpleasant
in
his
manner
,
that
,
rather
than
be
oblige
to
keep
him
company
,
I
would
resign
all
claim
to
the
inheritance
of
his
estate
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
his
be
torture
by
the
gout
may
have
sour
his
temper
,
and
,
perhaps
,
I
may
like
him
better
on
further
acquaintance
:
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
all
his
servant
and
neighbour
in
the
country
,
be
fond
of
him
,
even
to
a
degree
of
enthusiasm
,
the
reason
of
which
I
can
not

yet
comprehend

DEAR
MADAM
,
have
no
mother
of
my
own
<EOS>
,
I
hope
you
will
give
me
leave
to
disburthen
my
poor
heart
to
you
,
who
have
always
act
the
part
of
a
kind
parent
to
me
,
ever
since
I
be
put
under
your
care
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
and
indeed
,
my
worthy
governess
may
believe
me
,
when
I
assure
her
,
that
I
never
harbour
a
thought
that
be
otherwise
than
virtuous
;
and
,
if
God
will
give
me
grace
,
I
shall
never
behave
so
as
to
cast
a
reflection
on
the
care
you
have
take
in
my
education
.
<EOS>
I
confess
I
have
give
just
cause
of
offence
by
my
want
of
prudence
and
experience
.
<EOS>
I
ought
not
to
have
listen
to
what
the
young
man
say
;
and
it
be
my
duty
to
have
tell
you
all
that
pass
,
but
I
be
ashamed
to
mention
it
;
and
then
he
behave
so
modest
and
respectful
,
and
seem
to
be
so
melancholy
and
timorous
,
that
I
could
not
find
in
my
heart
to
do
any
thing
that
should
make
him
miserable
and
desperate
.
<EOS>
as
for
familiarity
,
I
do
declare
,
I
never
once
allow
him
the
favour
of
a
salute
;
and
as
to
the
few
letter
that
pass
between
us
,
they
be
all
in
my
uncle
's
hand
,
and
I
hope
they
contain
nothing
contrary
to
innocence
and
honour
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
still
persuade
that
he
be
not
what
he
appear
to
be
:
but
time
will
discover
 
mean
while
I
will
endeavour
to
forget
a
connexion
,
which
be
so
displeasing
to
my
family
.
<EOS>
I
have
cry
without
cease
,
and
have
not
taste
any
thing
but
tea
,
since
I
be
harry
away
from
you
;
nor
do
I
once
close
my
eye
for
three
night
run
.
  
<EOS>
My
aunt
continue
to
chide
me
severely
when
we
be
by
ourselves
;
but
I
hope
to
soften
her
in
time
,
by
humility
and
submission
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
who
be
so
dreadfully
passionate
in
the
beginning
,
have
be
move
by
my
tear
and
distress
;
and
be
now
all
tenderness
and
compassion
;
and
my
brother
be
reconcile
to
me
,
on
my
promise
to
break
off
all
correspondence
with
that
unfortunate
youth
:
but
,
notwithstanding
all
their
indulgence
,
I
shall
have
no
peace

<EOS>
my
dearest
letty
,
I
am
in
such
a
fright
,
lest
this
should
not
come
safe
to
hand
by
the
conveyance
of
Jarvis
the
carrier
,
that
I
beg
you
will
write
to
me
,
on
the
receipt
of
it
,
direct
to
me
,
under
cover
,
to
Mrs
Winifred
Jerkins
,
my
aunt
's
maid
,
who
be
a
good
girl
,
and
have
be
so
kind
to
me
in
my
affliction
,
that
I
have
make
her
my
confidant
;
as
for
Jarvis
,
he
be
very
shy
of
take
charge
of
my
letter
and
the
little
parcel
,
because
his
sister
Sally
have
like
to
have
lose
her
place
on
my
account
:
<EOS>
indeed
I
can
not
blame
the
man
for
his
caution
;
but
I
have
make
it
worth
his
while
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
companion
and
bed
-
fellow
,
it
be
a
grievous
addition
to
my
other
misfortune
,
that
I
be
deprive
of
your
agreeable
company
and
conversation
,
at
a
time
when
I
need
so
much
the
comfort
of
your
good
humour
and
good
sense
;
but
,
I
hope
,
the
friendship
we
contract
at
the
boarding
-
school
,
will
last
for
life
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
<EOS>
but
on
my
side
it
will
daily
increase
and
improve
,
as
I
gain
experience
,
and
learn
to
know
the
value
of
a
true
friend
.
  
<EOS>
o
,
my
dear
Letty
!
<EOS>
what
shall
I
say
about
poor
Mr
Wilson
?
<EOS>
I
have
promise
to
break
off
all
correspondence
,
and
,
if
possible
,
to
forget
him
:
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
I
begin
to
perceive
that
will
not
be
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
by
no
means
proper
that
the
picture
should
remain
in
my
hand
,
lest
it
should
be
the
occasion
of
more
mischief
,
I
have
send
it
to
you
by
this
opportunity
,
beg
you
will
either
keep
it
safe
till
well
time
,
or
return
it
to
Mr
Wilson
himself
,
who
,
I
suppose
,
will
make
it
his
business
to
see
you
at
the
usual
place
.
<EOS>
if
he
should
be
low
-
spirited
at
my
send
back
his
picture
,
you
may
tell
him
I
have
no
occasion
for
a
picture
,
while
the
original
continue
engrave
on
my
 
<EOS>
but
no
<EOS>
;
I
would
not
have
you
tell
him
that
neither
;
because
there
must
be
an
end
of
our
correspondence
  
<EOS>
I
wish
he
may
forget
me
,
for
the
sake
of
his
own
peace
;
and
yet
if
he
should
,
he
must
be
a
barbarous
  
<EOS>
but
'
tis
impossible
 
poor
Wilson
can
not
be
false
and
inconstant
:
I
beseech
him
not
to
write
to
me
,
nor
attempt
to
see
me
for
some
time
;
for
,
consider
the
resentment
and
passionate
temper
of
my
brother
Jery
,
such
an
attempt
may
be
attend
with
consequence
which
would
make
us
all
miserable
for
life
 
<EOS>
let
us
trust
to
time
and
the
chapter
of
accident
;
or
rather
to
that
Providence
which
will
not
fail
,
sooner
or
later
,
to
reward
those
that
walk
in
the
path
of
honour

<EOS>
I
would
offer
my
love
to
the
young

but
it
be
not
fit
that
any

them
should
know
you

<EOS>
if
we

I

my
simple
remark
upon
that
famous

DEAR
LEWIS
,
I
have
follow
your
direction
with
some
success
,
and
may
have
be
upon
my
leg
by
this
time
,
<EOS>
have
the
weather
permit
me
to
use
my
saddle
horse
.
<EOS>
I
ride
out
upon
the
Downs
last
Tuesday
,
in
the
forenoon
,
when
the
sky
,
as
far
as
the
visible
horizon
,
be
without
a
cloud
:
but
before
I
have
go
a
full
mile
,
I
be
overtake
instantaneously
by
a
storm
of
rain
that
wet
me
to
the
skin
in
three
minute
 
whence
<EOS>
it
come
the
devil
know
;
but
it
have
lay
me
up
(
I
suppose
for
one
fortnight
.
<EOS>
It
make
me
sick
to
hear
people
talk
of
the
fine
air
upon
Clifton
-
Downs
:
how
can
the
air
be
either
agreeable
or
salutary
,
where
the
daemon
of
vapour
descend
in
a
perpetual
drizzle
?
<EOS>
My
confinement
be
the
more
intolerable
,
as
I
be
surround
with
domestic
vexation
.
  
<EOS>
My
niece
have
have
a
dangerous
fit
of
illness
,
occasion
by
that
curse
incident
at
Gloucester
,
which
I
mention
in
my
last
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
a
poor
good
-
natured
simpleton
,
as
soft
as
butter
,
and
as
easily
melt
 
<EOS>
not
that
she
be
a
fool
 
<EOS>
the
girl
's
part
be
not
despicable
,
and
her
education
have
not
be
neglect
;
that
be
to
say
,
she
can
write
and
spell
,
and
speak
French
,
and
play
upon
the
harpsichord
;
then
she
dance
finely
,
have
a
good
figure
,
and
be
very
well
inclined
;
but
,
she
be
deficient
in
spirit
,
and
so
susceptible
 
and
so
tender
forsooth
!
  
<EOS>
truly
,
she
have
get
a
languish
eye
,
and
read
romance
 
<EOS>
then
there
be
her
brother
,
"
squire
Jery
,
a
pert
jackanapes
,
full
of
college
-
petulance
and
self
-
conceit
;
proud
as
a
german
count
,
and
as
hot
and
hasty
as
a
Welch
mountaineer
.
<EOS>
as
for
that
fantastical
animal
,
my
sister
Tabby
,
you
be
no
stranger
to
her
qualification
 
<EOS>
I
vow
to
God
<EOS>
,
she
be
sometimes
so
intolerable
,
that
I
almost
think
she
be
the
devil
incarnate
come
to
torment
me
for
my
sin
;
and
yet
I
be
conscious
of
no
sin
that
ought
to
entail
such
family
-
plague
upon
me
 
why
the
devil
should
not
I
shake
of
these
torment
at
once
?
<EOS>
I
an't
marry
to
Tabby
,
thank
Heaven
!
<EOS>
nor
do
I
beget
the
other
two
:
<EOS>
let
them
choose
another
guardian
:
for
my
part
,
I
an't
in
a
condition
to
take

much
less

superintend
the
conduct
of
giddy

<EOS>
You
earnestly
desire
to
know
the
particular
of
our

which
be

and
I

will
go

actor
 
a
handsome
young
fellow
that
go
by
the
name
of
Wilson
.
<EOS>
the
rascal
soon
perceive
the
impression
he
have
make
,
and
manage
matter
so
as
to
see
her
at
a
house
where
she
go
to
drink
tea
with
her
governess
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
beginning
of
a
correspondence
,
which
they
keep
up
by
mean
of
a
jade
of
a
milliner
who
make
and
dressed
cap
for
the
girl
at
the
boarding
-
school
.
<EOS>
when
we
arrive
at
Gloucester
,
Liddy
come
to
stay
at
lodging
with
her
aunt
,
and
Wilson
bribe
the
maid
to
deliver
a
letter
into
her
own
hand
;
but
it
seem
Jery
have
already
acquire
so
much
credit
with
the
maid
,
(
by
what
mean
he
best
know
)
that
she
carry
the
letter
to
him
,
and
so
the
whole
plot
be
discover
.
<EOS>
the
rash
boy
,
without
say
a
word
of
the
matter
to
me
,
go
immediately
in
search
of
Wilson
;
and
I
suppose
,
treat
him
with
insolence
enough
.
<EOS>
the
theatrical
hero
be
too
far
go
in
romance
to
brook
such
usage
:
he
reply
in
blank
verse
,
and
a
formal
challenge
ensue
.
<EOS>
They
agree
to
meet
early
next
morning
and
decide
the
dispute
with
sword
and
pistol
.
<EOS>
I
hear
nothing
at
all
of
the
affair
,
till
Mr
Morley
come
to
my
bedside
in
the
moring
,
and
tell
me
he
be
afraid
my
nephew
be
go
to
fight
,
as
he
have
be
overhear
talk
very
loud
and
vehement
with
Wilson
at
the
young
man
's
lodging
the
night
before
,
and
afterwards
go
and
buy
powder
and
ball
at
a
shop
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
I
get
up
immediately
,
and
upon
inquiry
find
he
be
just
go
out
.
<EOS>
I
beg
Morley
to
knock
up
the
mayor
,
that
he
may
interpose
as
a
magistrate
,
and
in
the
mean
time
I
hobble
after
the
squire
,
whom
I
see
at
a
distance
walk
at
a
great
pace
towards
the
city
gate
  
in
spite
of
all
my
effort
,
I
could
not
come
up
till
our
two
combatant
have
take
their
ground
,
and
be
prime
their
pistol
.
<EOS>
an
old
house
luckily
screen
me
from
their
view
;
so
that
I
rush
upon
them
at
once
,
before
I
be
perceive
.
<EOS>
They
be
both
confound
,
and
attempt
to
make
their
escape
different
way
;
but
Morley
come
up
with
constable
at
that
instant
,
take
Wilson
into
custody
,
and
Jery
follow
him
quietly
to
the
mayor
's
house
.
<EOS>
all
this
time
I
be
ignorant
of
what
have
pass
the
precede
day
;
and
neither
of
the
party
would
discover
a
tittle
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
the
mayor
observe
that
it
be
great
presumption
in
Wilson
who
be
a
stroller
,
to
proceed
to
such
ex
tremitie
with
a
gentleman
of
family
and
fortune
;
and
threaten
to
commit
him
on
the
vagrant
act
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
fellow
bustle
up
with
great
spirit
,
declare
he
be
a
gentleman
,
and
would
be
treat
as
such
;
but
he
refuse
to
explain
himself
further
.
<EOS>
the
master
of
the
company
be
send
for
,
and
examine
,
touch
the
say
Wilson
,
<EOS>
say
the
young
man
have
engage
with
him
at
Birmingham
about
six
month
ago
;
but
never
would
take
his
salary
;
that
he
have
behave
so
well
in
his
private
character
,
as
to
acquire
the
respect
and
good
-
will
of
all
his
acquaintance
,
and
that
the
public
own
his
merit
,
as
an
actor
,
be
altogether
extraordinary
.
  
<EOS>
after
all
,
I
fancy
,
he
will
turn
out
to
be
a
run
-
way
prentice
from
London
 
<EOS>
the
manager
offer
to
bail
him
for
any
sum
,
provide
he
would
give
his
word
and
honour
that
he
would
keep
the
peace
;
but
the
young
gentleman
be
on
his
high
rope
,
and
would
by
no
mean
lay
himself
under
any
restriction
:
on
the
other
hand
,
Hopefull
,
be
equally
obstinate
;
till
at
length
the
mayor
declare
,
that
if
they
both
refuse
to
be
bind
over
,
he
would
immediately
commit
Wilson
as
a
vagrant
to
hard
labour
.
<EOS>
I
own
<EOS>
I
be
much
pleased
with
Jery
's
behaviour
on
this
occasion
:
he
say
that
rather
than
Mr
Wilson
should
be
treat
in
such
an
ignominious
manner
,
he
would
give
his
word
and
honour
to
prosecute
the
affair
no
further
while
they
remain
at
Gloucester
 
<EOS>
Wilson
thank
him
for
his
generous
manner
of
proceeding
,
and
be
discharge
.
<EOS>
on
our
return
to
our
lodging
,
my
nephew
explain
the
whole
mystery
;
and
I
own
<EOS>
I
be
exceedingly
incensed
.
  
<EOS>
Liddy
be
question
on
the
subject
,
and
very
severely
reproach
by
that
wild
-
cat
my
sister
Tabby
,
first
swoon
away
,
then
dissolve
into
a
flood
of
tear
,
confess
all
the
particular
of
the
correspondence
,
at
the
same
time
give
up
three
letter
,
which
be
all
she
have
receive
from
her
admirer
.
<EOS>
the
last
,
which
Jery
intercept
,
I
send
you
inclose
,
and
when
you
have
read
it
,
I
dare
say
you
will
not
wonder
at
the
progress
the
writer
have
make
in
the
heart
of
a
simple
girl
,
utterly
unacquainted
with
the
character
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
think
it
be
high
time
to
remove
her
from
such
a
dangerous
connection
,
I
carry
her
off
the
very
next
day
to
Bristol
;
but
the
poor
creature
be
so
frightened
and
flutter
,
by
our
threat
and
expostulation
,
that
she
fall
sick
the
fourth
day
after
our
arrival
at
Clifton
,
and
continue
so
ill
for
a
whole
week
that
her
life
be
despair
of
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
till
yesterday
that
Dr
Rigge
declare
her
out
of
danger
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
imagine
what
I
have
suffer
,
partly
from
the
indiscretion
of
this
poor
child
,
but
much
more
from
the
fear
of
lose
her
entirely
.
<EOS>
this
air
be
intolerably
cold
,
and
the
place
quite
solitary
 
<EOS>
I
never
go
down
to
the
well
without
return
low
-
spirited
;
for
there
I
meet
with
half
a
dozen
poor
emaciate
creature
,
with
ghostly
look
,
in
the
last
stage
of
a
consumption
,
who
have
make
shift
to
linger
through
the
winter
,
like
so
many
exotic
plant
languish
in
a
hot
-
house
;
but
,
in
all
appearance
,
will
drop
into
their
grave
before
the
sun
have
warmth
enough
to
mitigate
the
rigour
of
this
ungenial
spring
.
  
<EOS>
if
you
think
the
Bath
water
will
be
of
any
service
to
me
,
I
will
go
thither
as
soon
as
my
niece
can
bear
the
motion
of
the
coach
.
  
<EOS>
tell
Barns
I
be
oblige
to
him
for
his
advice
;
but
do
not
choose
to
follow
it
.
<EOS>
if
Davis
voluntarily
offer
to
give
up
the
farm
,
the
other
shall
have
it
;
but
I
will
not
begin
at
this
time
of
day
to
distress
my
tenant
,
because
they
be
unfortunate
,
and
can
not
make
regular
payment
<EOS>
:
I
wonder
that
barn
would
think
me
capable
of
such
oppression
 
<EOS>
as
for
Higgins
,
the
fellow
be
a
notorious
poacher
,
to
be
sure
;
and
an
impudent
rascal
to
set
his
snare
in
my
own
paddock
;
but
,
I
suppose
,
he
think
he
have
some
right
(
especially
in
my
absence
)
to
partake
of
what
nature
seem
to
have
intend
for
common
use
 
you
may
threaten
him
in
my
name
,
as
much
as
you
please
,
and
if
he
repeat
the
offence
,
let
me
know
it
before
you
have
recourse
to
justice
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
you
be
a
great
sportsman
,
and
oblige
many
of
your
friend
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
you
to
make
use
of
my
ground
;
but
it
may
be
necessary
to
hint
,
that
I
be
more
afraid
of
my
fowl
piece
than
of
my
game
.
<EOS>
when
you
can
spare
two
or
three
brace
of
partridge
,
send
them
over
by
the
stage
coach
,
and
tell
Gwyllim
that

up

<EOS>
I

from

actually

I
hear
you

when
I
see
you

I
beheld
your

my

fill
with
such
tumult

wholly
deprive

encourage
by
your

I
venture

even

DEAR
PHILLIPS
,
I
give
Mansel
credit
for
his
invention
,
in
propagate
the
report
that
I
have
a
quarrel
with
a
mountebank
's
merry
Andrew
at
Gloucester
:
<EOS>
but
I
have
too
much
respect
for
every
appendage
of
wit
,
to
quarrel
even
with
the
low
buffoonery
;
and
therefore
I
hope
Mansel
<EOS>
and
I
shall
always
be
good
friend
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
,
however
,
approve
of
his
drown
my
poor
dog
Ponto
,
on
purpose
to
convert
Ovid
's
pleonasm
into
a
pun
epitaph
 
deerant
quoque
Littora
Ponto
:
for
,
that
he
throw
him
into
the
Isis
,
when
it
be
so
high
and
impetuous
,
with
no
other
view
than
to
kill
the
flea
,
be
an
excuse
that
will
not
hold
water
 
<EOS>
but
I
leave
poor
Ponto
to
his
fate
,
and
hope
Providence
will
take
care
to
accommodate
Mansel
with
a
drier
death
.
    
<EOS>
as
there
be
nothing
that
can
be
call
company
at
the
well
,
I
be
here
in
a
state
of
absolute
rustication
:
this
,
however
,
give
me
leisure
to
observe
the
singularity
in
my
uncle
's
character
,
which
seem
to
have
interested
your
curiosity
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
his
disposition
and
mine
,
which
,
like
oil
and
vinegar
,
repel
one
another
at
first
,
have
now
begin
to
mix
by
dint
of
be
beat
up
together
.
<EOS>
I
be
once
apt
to
believe
him
a
complete
Cynic
;
and
that
nothing
but
the
necessity
of
his
occasion
could
compel
him
to
get
within
the
pale
of
society
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
of
another
opinion
.
<EOS>
I
think
his
peevishness
arise
partly
from
bodily
pain
,
and
partly
from
a
natural
excess
of
mental
sensibility
;
for
,
I
suppose
the
mind
as
well
as
the
body
,
be
in
some
case
endue
with
a
morbid
excess
of
sensation
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
t'other
day
much
divert
with
a
conversation
that
pass
in
the
Pump
-
room
,
betwixt
him
and
the
famous
Dr
L####n
,
who
be
come
to
ply
at
the
well
for
patient
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
be
complain
of
the
stink
,
occasion
by
the
vast
quantity
of
mud
and
slime
,
which
the
river
leave
at
low
ebb
under
the
window
of
the
pump
-
room
.
<EOS>
He
observe
,
that
the
exhalation
arise
from
such
a
nuisance
,
could
not
but
be
prejudicial
to
the
weak
lung
of
many
consumptive
patient
,
who
come
to
drink
the
water
.
<EOS>
the
Doctor
overhear
this
remark
,
make
up
to
him
,
and
assure
him
he
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
people
in
general
be
so
mislead
by
vulgar
prejudice
,
that
philosophy
be
hardly
sufficient
to
undeceive
them
.
<EOS>
then
hum
thrice
,
he
assume
a
most
ridiculous
solemnity
of
aspect
,
and
enter
into
a
learned
investigation
of
the
nature
of
stink

He
observe
,
that
stink
,
or
stench
,
mean
no
more
than
a
strong
impression
on
the
olfactory
nerve
;
and
may
be
apply
to
substance
of
the
most
opposite
quality
;
that
in
the
dutch
language
,
stinken
signify
the
most
agreeable
perfume
,
as
well
as
the
most
fetid
odour
,
as
appear
in
Van
Vloudel
's
translation
of
Horace
,
in
that
beautiful
ode
,
Quis
multa
gracilis
,
&
c.
  
<EOS>
the
word
liquidus
perfusus
odoribus
<EOS>
,
he
translate
van

moschata
gestinken
:
<EOS>
that
individual
differ
toto
coelo
in
their
opinion
of
smell
,
which
,
indeed
,
be
altogether
as
arbitrary
as
the
opinion
of
beauty
;
that
the
French
be
please
with
the
putrid
effluvia
of
animal
food
;
and
so
be
the
Hottentots
in
Africa
,
and
the
savage
in
Greenland
;
and
that
the
Negroes
on
the
coast
of
Senegal
would
not
touch
fish
till
it
be
rotten
;
strong
presumption
in
favour
of
what
be
generally
call
stink
,
as
those
nation
be
in
a
state
of
nature
,
undebauche
by
luxury
,
unseduce
by
whim
and
caprice
:
that
he
have
reason
to
believe
the
stercoraceous
flavour
,
condemn
by
prejudice
as
a
stink
,
<EOS>
be
,
in
fact
,
most
agreeable
to
the
organ
of
smell
;
for
,
that
every
person
who
pretend
to
nauseate
the
smell
of
another
's
excretion
,
snuff
up
his
own
with
particular
complacency
;
for
the
truth
of
which
he
appeal
to
all
the
lady
and
gentleman
then
present
<EOS>
:
he
say
the
inhabitant
of
Madrid
and
Edinburgh
find
particular
satisfaction
in
breathe
their
own
atmosphere
,
which
be
always
impregnate
with
stercoraceous
effluvium
:
that
the
learn
Dr
B
#
#
#
#
,
in
his
treatise
on
the
Four
digestion
,
explain
in
what
manner
the
volatile
effluvia
from
the
intestine
,
stimulate
and
promote
the
operation
of
the
animal
oeconomy
<EOS>
:
he
affirm
,
the
last
Grand
Duke
of
Tuscany
,
of
the
Medicis
family
,
who
refine
upon
sensuality
with
the
spirit
of
a
philosopher
,
be
so
delighted
with
that
odour
,
that
he
cause
the
essence
of
ordure
to
be
extract
,
and
use
it
as
the
most
delicious
perfume
:
that
he
himself
,
(
the
doctor
)
<EOS>
when
he
happen
to
be
low
-
spirited
,
or
fatigue
with
business
,
find
immediate
relief
and
uncommon
satisfaction
from
hang
over
the
stale
content
of
a
close
-
stool
,
while
his
servant
stir
it
about
under
his
nose
;
nor
be
this
effect
to
be
wonder
at
,
when
we
consider
that
this
substance
abound
with
the
self
-
same
volatile
salt
that
be
so
greedily
smell
to
by
the
most
delicate
invalid
,
after
they
have
be
extract
and
sublime
by
the
chemist
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
the
company
begin
to
hold
their
nose
;
but
the
doctor
,
without
take
the
least
notice
of
this
signal
,
proceed
to
shew
,
that
many
fetid
substance
be
not
only
agreeable
but
salutary
;
such
as
assafoelida
,
and
other
medicinal
gum
,
resin
,
root
and
vegetable
,
over
and
above
burn
feather
,
tanpit
,
candle
snuff
,
&
c.
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
use
many
learn
argument
to
persuade
his
audience
out
of
their
sense
;
and
from
stench
make
a
transition
to
filth
,
which
he
affirm
be
also
a
mistaken
idea
,
in
as
much
as
object
so
call
,
be
no
other
than
certain
modification
of
matter
,
consist
of
the
same
principle
that
enter
into
the
composition
of
all
create
essence
,
whatever
they
may
be
:
that
in
the
filthiest
production
of
nature
,
a
philosopher
consider
nothing
but
the
earth
,
water
,
salt
,
and
air
of
which
it
be
compound
:
that
,
for
his
own
part
,
he
have
no
more
objection
to
drink
the
dirty
ditch
water
,
than
he
have
to
a
glass
of
water
from
the
Hot
Well
,
provide
he
be
assure
there
be
nothing
poisonous
in
the
concrete
.
<EOS>
then
address
himself
to
my
uncle
,
"
Sir
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
you
seem
to
be
of
a
dropsical
habit
,
and
probably
will
soon
have
a
confirm
ascite
:
if
I
should
be
present
when
you
be
tap
,
I
will
give
you
a
convincing
proof
of
what
I
assert
,
by
drink
without
hesitation
the
water
that
come
out
of
your
abdoman
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
lady
make
wry
face
at
this
declaration
,
and
my
uncle
change
colour
,
tell
him
he
do
not
desire
any
such
proof
of
his
philosophy
:
"
but
I
should
be
glad
to
know
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
what
make
you
think
I
be
of
a
dropsical
habit
?
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
beg
pardon
,
(
reply
the
Doctor
)
<EOS>
I
perceive
your
ancle
be
swell
,
and
you
seem
to
have
the
facie
leucophlegmatica
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
indeed
,
your
disorder
may
be
oedematous
,
or
gouty
,
or
it
may
be
the
lues
venerea
:
if
you
have
any
reason
to
flatter
yourself
<EOS>
it
be
this
last
,
sir
,
I
will
undertake
to
cure
you
with
three
small
pill
,
even
if
the
disease
should
have
attain
its
utmost
inveteracy
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
it
be
an
arcanum
which
I
have
discover
,
and
prepare
with
infinite
labour
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
have
lately
cure
a
woman
in
Bristol
 
a
common
prostitute
,
sir
,
who
have
get
all
the
bad
symptom
of
the
disorder
;
such
as
nodi
,
tophi
,
and
gummata
,
verrucae
,
cristae
Galli
,
and
a
serpiginous
eruption
,
or
rather
a
pocky
itch
all
over
her
body
.
  
<EOS>
by
that
time
she
have
take
the
second
pill
,
sir
,
by
Heaven
!
<EOS>
she
be
as
smooth
as
my
hand
,
and
the
third
make
her
as
sound
and
as
fresh
as
a
new
bear
infant
.
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
(
cry
my
uncle
peevishly
)
<EOS>
I
have
no
reason
to
flatter
myself
that
my
disorder
come
within
the
efficacy
of
your
nostrum
.
<EOS>
but
,
this
patient
you
talk
of
,
may
not
be
so
sound
at
bottom
as
you
imagine
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
possibly
be
mistake
:
(
rejoin
the
physician
)
for
I
have
have
communication
with
her
three
time
 
<EOS>
I
always
ascertain
my
cure
in
that
manner
.
<EOS>
"
at
this
remark
,
all
the
lady
retire
to
another
corner
of
the
room
,
and
some
of
them
begin
to
spit
 
<EOS>
as
to
my
uncle
,
though
he
be
ruffle
at
first
by
the
doctor
's
say
he
be
dropsical
,
he
could
not
help
smile
at
this
ridiculous
confession
,
and
,
I
suppose
,
with
a
view
to
punish
this
original
,
tell
him
there
be
a
wart
upon
his
nose
<EOS>
,
that
look
a
little
suspicious
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
pretend
to
be
a
judge
of
those
matter
;
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
but
I
understand
that
wart
be
often
produce
by
the
distemper
;
and
that
one
upon
your
nose
seem
to
have
take
possession
of
the
very
keystone
of
the
bridge
,
which
I
hope
be
in
no
danger
of
fall
.
"
<EOS>
L####n
seem
a
little
confounded
at
this
remark
,
and
assure
him
it
be
nothing
but
a
common
excrescence
of
the
cuticula
,
but
that
the
bone
be
all
sound
below
;
for
the
truth
of
this
assertion
he
appeal
to
the
touch
,
desire
he
would
feel
the
part
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
say
it
be
a
matter
of
such
delicacy
to
meddle
with
a
gentleman
's
nose
,
that
he
decline
the
office
 
upon
which
,
the
Doctor
turn
to
me
,
intreate
me
to
do
him
that
favour
.
<EOS>
comply
with
his
request
,
and
handle
it
so
roughly
,
and
he
sneeze
,
and
the
tear
run
down
hi
-
cheek
,
to
the
no
small
entertainment
of
the
company
,
and
particularly
of
my
uncle
,
who
burst
out
a
-
laughing
for
the
first
time
since
I
have
be
with
him
;
and
take
notice
,
that
the
part
seem
to
be
very
tender
.
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
(
cry
the
Doctor
)
<EOS>
it
be
naturally
a
tender
part
;
but
to
remove
all
possibility
of
doubt
,
I
will
take
off
the
wart
this
very
night
.
"
    
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
bow
with
great
solemnity
all
round
,
and
retire
to
his
own
lodging
,
where
he
apply
a
caustic
to
the
wart
;
but
it
spread
in
such
a
manner
as
to
produce
a
considerable
inflammation
,
attend
with
an
enormous
swelling
;
so
that
when
he
next
appear
,
his
whole
face
be
overshadow
by
this
tremendous
nozzle
;
and
the
rueful
eagerness
with
which
he
explain
this
unlucky
accident
,
be
ludicrous
beyond
all
description
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
much
pleased
with
meet
the
original
of
a
character
,
which
you
and
I
have
often
laugh
at
in
description
;
and
what
surprize
me
very
much
,
I
find
the
feature
in
the
picture
,
which
have
be
draw
for
him
,
rather
soften
than
over
-
charge
.
     
<EOS>
as
I
have
something
else
to
say
;
and
this
letter
have
run
to
an
unconscionable
length
,
I
shall
now
give
you
a
little
respite
,
and
trouble
you
again
by
the
very
first
post
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
take
it
in
your
head
to
retaliate
these
double
stroke
upon
    
your

<EOS>
DEAR
KNIGHT
,
I
now
sit
down
to
execute
the
threat
in
the
tail
of
my
last
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
I
be
big
with
the
secret
,
and
long
to
be
deliver
.
<EOS>
It
relate
to
my
guardian
,
who
,
you
know
,
be
at
present
our
principal
object
in
view
.
    
<EOS>
T'other
day
,
I
think
I
have
detect
him
in
such
a
state
of
frailty
,
as
would
but
ill
become
his
year
and
character
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
decent
sort
of
a
woman
,
not
disagreeable
in
her
person
,
that
come
to
the
well
,
with
a
poor
emaciate
child
,
far
go
in
a
consumption
.
<EOS>
I
have
catch
my
uncle
's
eye
several
time
direct
to
this
person
,
with
a
very
suspicious
expression
in
them
,
and
every
time
he
see
himself
observe
,
he
hastily
withdraw
them
,
with
evident
mark
of
confusion
 
<EOS>
I
resolve
to
watch
him
more
narrowly
,
and
see
him
speak
to
her
privately
in
a
corner
of
the
walk
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
go
down
to
the
well
one
day
,
I
meet
her
half
way
up
the
hill
to
Clifton
,
and
could
not
help
suspect
she
be
go
to
our
lodging
by
appointment
,
as
it
be
about
one
o'clock
,
the
hour
when
my
sister
and
I
be
generally
at
the
pump
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
this
notion
excite
my
curiosity
,
I
return
by
a
back
way
,
and
get
unperceived
into
my
own
chamber
,
which
be
contiguous
to
my
uncle
's
apartment
.
<EOS>
sure
enough
,
the
woman
be
introduce
,
but
not
into
his
bed
-
chamber
;
he
give
her
audience
,
in
a
parlour
;
so
that
I
be
oblige
to
shift
my
station
to
another
room
,
where
,
however
,
there
be
a
small
chink
in
the
partition
,
through
which
I
could
perceive
what
pass
 
My
uncle
though
a
little
lame
,
rise
up
when
she
come
in
,
and
set
a
chair
for
her
,
desire
she
would
sit
down
:
then
he
ask
if
she
would
take
a
dish
of
chocolate
,
which
she
decline
,
with
much
acknowledgment
.
<EOS>
after
a
short
pause
,
he
say
,
in
a
croak
tone
of
voice
which
confound
me
not
a
little
,
"
Madam
,
I
be
truly
concerned
for
your
misfortune
;
and
if
this
trifle
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
,
I
beg
you
will
accept
it
without
ceremony
,
"
so
say
,
he
put
a
bit
of
paper
into
her
hand
,
which
she
open
with
great
trepidation
,
exclaim
in
an
ecstasy
,
"
twenty

<EOS>
o

"
and
sink
down
upon
a
settee
,
faint
away
 
frightne
at
this
fit
,
and
,
I
suppose
,
afraid
of
call
for
assistance
,
lest
her
situation
should
give
rise
to
unfavourable
conjecture
,
he
run
about
the
room
in
distraction
,
make
frightful
grimace
;
and
,
at
length
,
have
recollection
enough
to
throw
a
little
water
in
her
face
;
by
which
application
she
be
bring
to
herself
:
<EOS>
but
,
then
her
feeling
take
another
turn
.
<EOS>
She
shed
a
flood
of
tear
,
and
cry
aloud
,
"
I
know
not

all

"
by
this
time

uncle
's
indignation
be
effectually
rouze

<EOS>
His
face
grow
pale
,
his
tooth
chatter
,
and
his
eye
flash
 
"
Sister
,
(
<EOS>
cry
he
,
in
a
voice
like
thunder
)
<EOS>
I
vow
to
God
,
<EOS>
your
impertinence
be
exceedingly
provoking

"
<EOS>
with
these
word
,
he
take
her
by
the
hand
,
and
,
open
the
door
of
communication
,
thrust
her
into
the
chamber
where
I
stand
,
so
affect
by
the
scene
,
that
the
tear
run
down
my
cheek

<EOS>
observe
these
mark
of
emotion
,
"
I
do
not
wonder
(
say
she
)
to
see
you
concerned
at
the
back
-
sliding
of
so
near
a
relation
;
a
man
of
his
year
and
infirmity
:
these
be
fine
doing
,
truly
 
this
be
a
rare
example
,
set
by
a
guardian
for
the
benefit
of
his
pupil
 
monstrous
!
<EOS>
incongrous
!
<EOS>
sophistical
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
<EOS>
but
an
act
of
justice
to
set
her
to
right
;
and
therefore
explain
the
mystery
 
<EOS>
but
she
would
not
be
undeceived
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
(
say
she
)
<EOS>
would
you
go
for
to
offer
,
for
to
arguesy
me
out
of
my
sense

<EOS>
did'n't
<EOS>
I
hear
him
whisper
to
her
to
hold
her
tongue
?
<EOS>
did'n't
<EOS>
I
see
her
in
tear
?
<EOS>
did'n't
<EOS>
I
see
him
struggle
to
throw
her
upon
the
couch

<EOS>
o
filthy

<EOS>
hideous
!
<EOS>
abominable
!
<EOS>
child

not

<EOS>
who
give
twenty
pound
in

<EOS>
but
you
be
a
stripling
 
You
know
nothing
of
the
world
 
<EOS>
besides
charity
begin
at

twenty
pound
would
buy
me
a
complete
suit
of
flower
silk
,
trimming
and
all
 
<EOS>
"
in
short
,
I
quit
the
room
,
my
contempt
for
her
,
and
my
respect
for
her
brother
,
be
increase
in
the
same
proportion
.
<EOS>
I
have
since
be
inform
,
that
the
person
,
whom
my
uncle
so
generously
relieve
,
be
the
widow
of
an
ensign
,
who
have
nothing
to
depend
upon
but
the
pension
of
fifteen
pound
a
year
.
<EOS>
the
people
of
the
Well
-
house
give
her
an
excellent
character
.
<EOS>
She
lodge
in
a
garret
,
and
work
very
hard
at
plain

work

to
support
her
daughter
,
who
be
die
of
a
consumption

<EOS>
I
must
own
,
to
my
shame
,
I
feel
a
strong
inclination
to
follow
my
uncle
's
example
,
in
relieve
this
poor
widow
;
but
,
betwixt
friend
,
I
be
afraid
of
be
detect
in
a
weakness
that
may
entail
the
ridicule
of
the

Dear
Phillips

Your

Melford

<EOS>
Direct
your
next
to
me
at
Bath

Dr

<EOS>
Hot
well
,
April
20
.
    
<EOS>
I
understand
your
hint
.
<EOS>
there
be
mystery
in
physick
,
as
well
as
in
religion
;
which
we
of
the
prophane
have
no
right
to
investigate
 
<EOS>
a
man
must
not
presume
to
use
his
reason
,
unless
he
have
study
the
category
,
and
can
chop
logic
by
mode
and
figure
 
between
friend
,
I
think
,
every
man
of
tolerable
part
ought
,
at
my
time
of
day
,
to
be
both
physician
and
lawyer
,
as
far
as
his
own
constitution
and
property
be
concern
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
have
have
an
hospital
these
fourteen
year
within
myself
,
and
study
my
own
case
with
the
most
painful
attention
;
consequently
may
be
suppose
to
know
something
of
the
matter
,
altho
'
I
have
not
take
regular
course
of
phisiology
,
et
cetera
,
et
cetera
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
have
for
some
time
be
of
opinion
,
(
no
offence
,
dear
doctor
)
that
the
sum
of
all
your
medical
discovery
amount
to
this
,
that
the
more
you
study
the
less
you
know
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
read
all
that
have
be
write
on
the
Hot
Wells
,
and
what
I
can
collect
from
the
whole
,
be
that
the
water
contain
nothing
but
a
little
salt
,
and
calcarious
earth
,
mix
in
such
inconsiderable
proportion
,
as
can
have
very
little
,
if
any
,
effect
on
the
animal
oeconomy
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
case
,
I
think
,
the
man
deserve
to
be
fit
with
a
cap
and
bell
,
who
,
for
such
a
paltry
advantage
as
this
spring
afford
,
sacrifice
his
precious
time
,
which
may
be
employ
in
take
more
effectual
remedy
,
and
expose
himself
to
the
dirt
,
the
stench
,
the
chilling
blast
,
and
perpetual
rain
,
that
render
this
place
to
me
intolerable
.
<EOS>
if
these
water
,
from
a
small
degree
of
astringency
,
be
of
some
service
in
the
diabetes
,
diarrhea
,
and
night
sweat
,
when
the
secretion
be
to
much
encrease
,
must
not
they
do
harm
in
the
same
pro
portion
,
where
the
humour
be
obstruct
,
as
in
the
asthma
,
scurvy
gout
,
and
dropsy
?
  
<EOS>
now
we
talk
of
the
dropsy
,
here
be
a
strange
,
fantastical
oddity
,
one
of
your
brother
,
who
harangue
every
day
in
the
pump
-
room
,
as
if
he
be
hire
to
give
lecture
on
all
subject
whatsoever
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
make
of
him
 
<EOS>
sometimes
he
make
shrewd
remark
;
at
other
time
,
he
talk
like
the
great
simpleton
in
nature
 
<EOS>
He
have
read
a
great
deal
;
but
without
method
or
judgment
,
and
digest
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
believe
every
thing
he
have
read
;
especially
if
it
have
any
thing
of
the
marvellous
in
it
;
and
his
conversation
be
a
surprising
hotch
potch
of
erudition
and
extravagance
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
me
t'other
day
,
with
great
confidence
,
that
my
case
be
dropsical
;
or
,
as
he
call
it
,
leucophlegmatic
:
a
sure
sign
,
that
his
want
of
experience
be
equal
to
his
presumption
;
for
,
you
know
,
there
be
nothing
analogous
to
the
dropsy
in
my
disorder
 
<EOS>
I
wish
those
impertinent
fellow
,
with
their
ricketty
understanding
,
would
keep
their
advice
for
those
that
ask
it
 
Dropsy
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
sure
I
have
not
live
to
the
age
of
fifty
-
five
,
and
have
such
experience
of
my
own
disorder
,
and
consult
you
and
other
eminent
physician
,
so
often
,
and
so
long
,
to
be
undeceive
by
such
a
  
<EOS>
but
,
without
all
doubt
,
the
man
be
mad
;
and
,
therefore
,
what
he
say
be
of
no
consequence
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
yesterday
,
a
visit
from
Higgins
;
who
come
hither
under
the
terror
of
your
threat
,
and
bring
me
as
a
present
a
brace
of
hare
;
which
he
own
he
take
in
my
own
ground
;
and
I
could
not
persuade
the
fellow
that
he
do
wrong
,
or
that
I
would
ever
prosecute
him
for
poach
 
<EOS>
I
must
desire
you
will
wink
hard
at
the
practise
of
this
rascallion
;
otherwise
I
shall
be
plague
with
his
present
;
which
cost
me
more
than
they
be
worth
  
<EOS>
if
I
could
wonder
at
any
thing
Fitzowen
do
,
I
should
be
surprised
at
his
assurance
,
in
desire
you
to
solicit
my
vote
for
him
,
at
the
next
election
for
the
county
:
for
him
,
who
oppose
me
on
the
like
occasion
,
with
the
most
illiberal
competition
  
<EOS>
You
may
tell
him
civilly
,
that
I
beg
to
be
excuse
.
<EOS>
direct
your
next
for
me
at
Bath
,
whither
I
propose
to
remove
to

morrow
;
not
only
on
my
own
account
,
but
for
the
sake
of
my
niece

Liddy

who
be
like
to

<EOS>
I
be
afraid
there
be
something
still

in
that
little

of

which
I
hope
a
change
of
object
will
remove

<EOS>
let
me
know
what
you
think
of
this
half

witted
Doctor

impertinent

ridiculous
,
and
absurd
notion

so
far
from

Hot

<EOS>
my
dear
letty
,
I
do
not
intend
to
trouble
you
again
,
till
we
should
be
settle
at
Bath
;
but
have
the
occasion
of
Jarvis
,
I
could
not
let
it
slip
,
especially
as
I
have
something
extraordinary
to
communicate
 
o
,
my
dear
companion
!
<EOS>
what
shall
I
tell
you
?
<EOS>
for
several
day
past
there
be
a
Jew
-
looking
man
,
that
ply
at
the
Wells
with
a
box
of
spectacle
;
and
he
always
eye
me
so
earnestly
,
that
I
begin
to
be
very
uneasy
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
he
come
to
our
lodging
at
Clifton
,
and
linger
about
the
door
,
as
if
he
want
to
speak
to
somebody
 
<EOS>
I
be
seize
with
an
odd
kind
of
fluttering
,
and
beg
Win
to
throw
herself
in
his
way
:
but
the
poor
girl
have
weak
nerve
,
and
be
afraid
of
his
beard
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
have
occasion
for
new
glass
,
call
him
up
stair
,
and
be
try
a
pair
of
spectacle
,
when
the
man
,
advance
to
me
say
,
in
a
whisper
 
o
gracious
!
<EOS>
what
d'ye
think
he
say
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
Wilson
!
"
<EOS>
His
feature
strike
me
that
very
moment
 
<EOS>
it
be
Wilson
,
sure
enough
!
<EOS>
but
so
disguised
,
that
it
would
have
be
impossible
to
know
him
,
if
my
heart
have
not
assist
in
the
discovery
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
surprised
,
and
so
frightened
,
that
I
faint
away
;
but
soon
recover
;
and
find
myself
support
by
him
on
the
chair
,
while
my
uncle
be
run
about
the
room
,
with
the
spectacle
on
his
nose
call
for
help
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
opportunity
to
speak
to
him
;
but
our
look
be
sufficiently
expressive
.
<EOS>
He
be
pay
for
his
glass
,
and
go
away
.
<EOS>
then
I
tell
Win
who
he
be
,
and
send
her
after
him
to
the
pump
-
room
;
where
she
speak
to
him
,
and
beg
him
in
my
name
to
withdraw
from
the
place
,
that
he
may
not
incur
the
suspicion
of
my
uncle
or
my
brother
,
if
he
do
not
want
to
see
me
die
of
terror
and
vexation
.
<EOS>
the
poor
youth
declare
,
with
tear
in
his
eye
,
that
he
have
something
extraordinary
to
communicate
;
and
ask
,
if
she
would
deliver
a
letter
to
me
:
but
this
she
absolutely
refuse
,
by
my
order
.
  
<EOS>
find
her
obstinate
in
her
refusal
,
he
desire
she
would
tell
me
,
that
he
be
no
longer
a
player
,
but
a
gentleman
;
in
which
character
he
would
very
soon
avow
his
passion
for
me
,
without
fear
of
censure
or
reproach
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
he
even
discover
his
name
and
family
;
which
,
to
my
great
grief
,
the
simple
girl
forget
,
in
the
confusion
occasion
by
her
be
see
talk
to
him
by
my
brother
;
who
stopt
her
on
the
road
,
and
ask
what
business
she
have
with
that
rascally
Jew
  
<EOS>
She
pretend
she
be
cheapen
a
stay
-
hook
;
but
be
throw
into
such
a
quandary
,
that
she
forget
the
most
material
part
of
the
information
;
and
when
she
come
home
,
go
into
an
hysteric
fit
of
laughing
.
<EOS>
this
transaction
happen
three
day
ago
,
during
which
he
have
not
appear
;
so
that
I
suppose
he
be
go
.
<EOS>
dear
Letty
!
<EOS>
you
see
how
Fortune
take
pleasure
in
persecute
your
poor
friend
.
<EOS>
if
you
should
see
him
at
Gloucester
 
<EOS>
or
if
you
have
see
him
,
and
know
his
real
name
and
family
,
pray
keep
me
no
longer
in
suspence
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
if
he
be
under
no
obligation
to
keep
himself
longer
conceal
,
and
have
a
real
affection
for
me
,
I
should
hope
he
will
,
in
a
little
time
,
declare
himself
to
my
relation
.
<EOS>
sure
,
if
there
be
nothing
unsuitable
in
the
match
,
they
will
not
be
so
cruel
as
to
thwart
my
inclination
 
<EOS>
o
,
what
happiness
would
then
be
my
portion
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
indulge
the
thought
,
and
please
my
fancy
with
such
agreeable
idea
;
which
,
after
all
,
perhaps
,
will
never
be
realise
 
<EOS>
but
,
why
should
I
despair
?
<EOS>
who
know
what
will
happen
?
  
<EOS>
We
set
out
for
Bath
to
-
morrow
,
and
I
be
almost
sorry
for
it
;
as
I
begin
to
be
in
love
with
solitude
,
and
this
be
a
charming
romantic
place
.
<EOS>
the
air
be
so
pure
;
the
down
be
so
agreeable
;
the
furze
in
full
blossom
;
the
ground
enamel
with
daisy
,
and
primrose
,
and
cowslip
;
all
the
tree
burst
into
leave
,
and
the
hedge
already
cloathe
with
their
vernal
livery
;
the
mountain
cover
with
flock
of
sheep
,
and
tender
bleating
wanton
lambkin
play
,
frisk
and
skip
from
side
to
side
;
the
grove
resound
with
the
note
of
black
-
bird
,
thrush
,
and
linnet
;
and
all
night
long
sweet
<EOS>
Philomel
pour
forth
her
ravishingly
-
delightful
song
.
<EOS>
then
,
for
variety
,
we
go
down
to
the
nymph
of
Bristol
spring
,
where
the
company
be
assemble
before
dinner
;
so
good
-
natured
,
so
free
,
so
easy
;
and
<EOS>
there
we
drink
the
water
so
clear
,
so
pure

to

<EOS>
DEAR
PHILLIPS
<EOS>
,
you
have
,
indeed
,
reason
to
be
surprised
,
that
I
should
have
conceal
my
correspondence
with
miss
Blakerby
from
you
,
to
whom
I
disclose
all
my
other
connection
of
that
nature
;
but
the
truth
be
,
I
never
dream
of
any
such
commerce
,
till
your
last
inform
me
,
that
it
have
produce
something
which
could
not
be
much
longer
conceal
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
lucky
circumstance
,
however
,
that
her
reputation
will
not
suffer
any
detriment
,
but
rather
derive
advantage
from
the
discovery
;
which
will
prove
,
at
least
,
that
it
be
not
quite
so
rotten
,
as
most
people
imagine
 
for
my
own
part
,
I
declare
to
you
,
in
all
the
sincerity
of
friendship
,
that
far
from
have
any
amorous
intercourse
with
the
object
in
question
I
never
have
the
least
acquaintance
with
her
person
;
but
,
if
she
be
really
in
the
condition
you
describe
,
I
suspect
Mansel
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
.
<EOS>
His
visit
to
that
shrine
be
no
secret
;
and
this
attachment
,
add
to
some
good
office
,
which
you
know
he
have
do
me
,
since
I
leave
Alma
-
mater
,
give
me
a
right
to
belive
him
capable
of
saddle
me
with
this
scandal
,
when
my
back
be
turn
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
if
my
name
can
be
of
any
service
to
him
,
he
be
welcome
to
make
use
of
it
;
and
if
the
woman
should
be
abandon
enough
to
swear
his
bantling
to
me
,
I
must
beg
the
favour
of
you
to
compound
with
the
parish
:
I
shall
pay
the
penalty
without
repine
;
and
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
draw
upon
me
immediately
for
the
sum
require
  
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
,
I
act
by
the
advice
of
my
uncle
;
who
say
,
I
shall
have
good
-
luck
if
I
pass
through
life
without
be
oblige
to
make
many
more
composition
of
the
same
kind
.
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
tell
me
last
night
,
with
great
good
humour
that
betwixt
the
age
of
twenty
and
forty
,
he
have
be
oblige
to
provide
for
nine
bastard
,
swear
to
him
by
woman
whom
he
never
see
 
Mr
Bramble
's
character
,
which
seem
to
interest
you
greatly
,
open
and
improve
upon
me
every
day
.
  
<EOS>
His
singularity
afford
a
rich
mine
of
entertainment
:
his
understanding
,
so
far
as
I
can
judge
,
be
well
cultivated
:
his
observation
on
life
be
equally
just
,
pertinent
,
and
uncommon
.
<EOS>
He
affect
misanthrophy
,
in
order
to
conceal
the
sensibility
of
a
heart
,
which
be
tender
,
even
to
a
degree
of
weakness
,
this
delicacy
of
feeling
,
or
soreness
of
the
mind
make
him
timorous
and
fearful
;
but
then
he
be
afraid
of
nothing
so
much
as
of
dishonour
;
and
although
he
be
exceedingly
cautious
of
give
offence
,
he
will
fire
at
the
least
hint
of
insolence
or
ill
-
breeding
 
respectable
as
he
be
,
upon
the
whole
,
I
can
not
help
be
sometimes
divert
by
his
little
distress
;
which
provoke
him
to
let
fly
the
shaft
of
his
satire
,
keen
and
penetrate
as
the
arrow
of
Teucer
 
<EOS>
Our
aunt
,
Tabitha
,
act
upon
him
as
<EOS>
a
perpetual
grind
-
stone
 
She
be
,
in
all
respect
,
a
striking
contrast
to
her
brother
 
<EOS>
but
I
reserve
her
portrait
for
another
occasion
.
    
<EOS>
three
day
ago
we
come
hither
from
the
Hot
Well
,
and
take
possession
of
the
first
floor
of
a
lodging
-
house
,
on
the
South
Parade
;
a
situation
which
my
uncle
choose
,
for
its
being
near
the
Bath
,
and
remote
from
the
noise
of
carriage
.
<EOS>
He
be
scarce
warm
in
the
lodging
when
he
call
for
his
night
cap
,
his
wide
shoe
and
flannel
;
and
declare
himself
invest
with
the
gout
in
his
right
foot
;
though
,
I
believe
,
it
have
as
yet
reach
no
farther
than
his
imagination
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
before
he
have
reason
to
repent
his
premature
declaration
;
for
our
aunt
Tabitha
find
mean
to
make
such
a
clamour
and
confusion
,
before
the
flannel
could
be
produce
from
the
trunk
,
that
one
would
have
imagine
the
house
be
on
fire
.
<EOS>
all
this
time
,
uncle
sit
boil
with
impatience
,
bite
his
finger
,
throw
up
his
eye
,
and
mutter
ejaculation
;
at
length
he
burst
into
a
kind
of
convulsive
laugh
,
after
which
he
hum
a
song
;
and
when
the
hurricane
be
over
,
exclaim
,
"
bless
be
God
for
all
thing
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
but
the
begining
of
his
trouble
.
<EOS>
Mrs
,
Tabitha
's
favourite
dog
Chowder
,
have
pay
his
compliment
to
a
female
turn
-
spit
,
of
his
own
specie
,
in
the
kitchen
,
involve
himself
in
a
quarrel
with
no
few
than
five
rival
,
who
set
upon
him
at
once
,
and
drive
him
up
stair
to
the
dining
-
room
door
,
with
hideous
noise
:
there
our
aunt
and
her
woman
,
take
arm
in
his
defence
,
join
the
concert
;
which
become
truly
diabolical
.
<EOS>
this
fray
be
with
difficulty
suppress
,
by
the
intervention
of
our
own
foot
-
man
and
the
cook
-
maid
of
the
house
,
the
"
squire
have
just
open
his
mouth
to
expostulate
with
Tabby
,
when
the
town
-
wait
,
in
the
passage
below
,
strike
up
their
musick
,
(
if
musick
it
may
be
call
)
with
such
a
sudden
burst
of
sound
,
as
make
him
start
and
stare
,
with
mark
of
indignation
and
disquiet
.
<EOS>
He
have
recollection
enough
to
send
his
servant
with
some
money
to
silence
those
noisy
intruder
;
and
they
be
immediately
dismiss
,
though
not
without
some
opposition
on
the
part
of
Tabitha
,
who
think
it
but
reasonable
that
he
should
have
more
musick
for
his
money
.
<EOS>
Scarce
have
he
settle
this
knotty
point
,
when
a
strange
kind
of
thumping
and
bouncing
be
hear
right
over
-
head
,
in
the
second
story
,
so
loud
and
violent
as
to
shake
the
whole
building
.
<EOS>
I
own
I
be
exceedingly
provoke
at
this
new
alarm
;
and
before
my
uncle
have
time
to
express
himself
on
the
subject
I
run
up
stair
,
to
see
what
be
the
matter
.
<EOS>
find
the
room
-
door
open
,
I
enter
without
ceremony
,
and
perceive
an
object
,
which
I
can
not
now
recollect
without
laugh
to
excess
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
dancing
master
,
with
his
scholar
,
in
the
act
of
teaching
.
<EOS>
the
master
be
blind
of
one
eye
,
and
lame
of
one
foot
,
and
lead
about
the
room
his
pupil
,
who
seem
to
be
about
the
age
of
three
-
score
,
stoop
mortally
,
be
tall
,
raw
-
boned
,
hard
-
favour
,
with
a
woolen
night
cap
on
his
head
;
and
he
have
stript
off
his
coat
,
that
he
may
be
more
nimble
in
his
motion
 
<EOS>
find
himself
intrude
upon
,
by
a
person
he
do
not
know
,
he
forthwith
gird
himself
with
a
long
iron
sword
,
and
advance
to
me
,
with
a
peremptory
air
,
pronounce
,
in
a
true
hibernian
accent
,
"
Mister
what
d'ye
cal
lum
,
by
my
should
and
conscience
,
I
be
very
glad
to
sea
you
,
if
you
be
after
come
in
the
way
of
friendship
;
and
indeed
and
indeed
now
I
believe
you
be
my
friend
sure
enough
,
gra
;
though
I
never
have
the
honour
to
sea
your
face
before
,
my
dear
;
for
becaase
you
come
like
a
friend
,
without
any
ceremony
at
all
,
at
all
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
him
the
nature
of
my
visit
would
not
admit
of
ceremony
;
that
I
be
come
to
desire
he
would
make
less
noise
,
as
there
be
a
sick
gentleman
below
whom
he
have
no
right
to
disturb
with
such
preposterous
doing
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
look
-
ye
now
,
young
gentleman
,
(
reply
this
original
)
perhaps
,
upon
another
occasion
,
I
may
shivilly
request
you
to
explain
the
maining
of
that
hard
word
,
prepasterous
:
but
there
be
a
time
for
all
thing
,
honey
 
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
pass
me
with
great
agility
,
and
,
run
down
stair
,
find
our
footman
at
the
dining
-
room
door
,
of
whom
he
demand
admittance
,
to
pay
his
respect
to
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
as
the
fellow
do
not
think
proper
to
refuse
the
request
of
such
a
formidable
figure
,
he
be
immediately
introduce
,
and
address
himself
to
my
uncle
in
these
word
:
"
Your
humble
servant
,
good
sir
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
so
prepasterous
,
as
your
son
call
it
,
but
I
know
the
rule
of
shivility
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
poor
knight
of
Ireland
<EOS>
,
my
name
be
Sir
Ulic
Mackilligut
,
of
the
county
of
Galway
;
be
your

I
be
come
to
pay
my
respect
,
and
to
welcome
you
to
the
South
Parade
,
and
to
offer
my
good
service
to
you
,
and
your
good
lady
,
and
your
pretty
daughter
;
and
even
to
the
young
gentleman
your
son
,
though
he
think
me
a
prepasterous
fellow
 
<EOS>
You
must
know
I
be
to
have
the
honour
to
open
a
ball
next
door
to
morrow
with
lady
Mac
Manus
;
and
be
rust
in
my
dancing
,
I
be
refresh
my
memory
with
a
little
exercise
;
but
if
I
have
know
there
be
a
sick
person
below
,
by
Christ
!
<EOS>
I
would
have
sooner
dance
a
hompipe
upon
my
own
head
,
than
walk
the
softest
minuet
over
yours
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
who
be
not
a
little
startled
at
his
first
appearance
,
receive
his
compliment
with
great
complacency
,
insist
upon
his
be
seat
,
thank
him
for
the
honour
of
his
visit
,
and
reprimand
me
for
my
abrupt
expostulation
with
a
gentleman
of
his
rank
and
character
.
<EOS>
thus
tutor
,
I
ask
pardon
of
the
knight
,
who
,
forthwith
start
up
,
embrace
me
so
close
,
that
I
could
hardly
breathe
;
and
assure
me
,
he
love
me
as
his
own
soul
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
recollect
his
night
-
cap
,
he
pull
it
off
in
some
confusion
;
and
,
with
his
bald
-
pate
uncover
,
make
a
thousand
apology
to
the
lady
,
as
he
retire
 
at
that
instant
,
the
Abbey
bel
's
begin
to
ring
so
loud
,
that
we
could
not
hear
one
another
speak
;
and
this
peal
,
as
we
afterwards
learn
,
be
for
the
honour
of
Mr
Bullock
,
an
eminent
cow
keeper
of
Tottenham
,
who
have
just
arrive
at
Bath
,
to
drink
the
water
for
indigestion
.
<EOS>
Mr
Bramble
have
not
time
to
make
his
remark
upon
the
agreeable
nature
of
this
serenade
,
before
his
ear
be
salute
with
another
concert
that
interest
him
more
nearly
.
<EOS>
two
negro
belong
to
a
Creole
gentleman
,
who
lodge
in
the
same
house
,
take
their
station
at
a
window
in
the
stair
-
case
about
ten
foot
from
our
dining

room
door
,
begin
to
practise
upon
the
French
-
horn
;
and
be
in
the
very
first
rudiment
of
execution
,
produce
such
discordant
sound
,
as
may
have
discompose
the
organ
of
an
ass
 
<EOS>
You
may
guess
what
effect
they
have
upon
the
irritable
nerve
of
uncle
:
who
,
with
the
most
admirable
expression
of
splenetic
surprize
in
his
countenance
,
send
his
man
to
silence
those
dreadful
blast
,
and
desire
the
musician
to
practise
in
some
other
place
,
as
they
have
no
right
to
stand
there
and
disturb
all
the
lodger
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
those
sable
performer
,
far
from
take
the
hint
,
and
withdraw
treat
the
messenger
with
great
insolence
;
bid
him
carry
his
compliment
to
their
master
,
colonel
Rigworm
,
who
would
give
him
a
proper
answer
,
and
a
good
drubbing
into
the
bargain
;
in
the
mean
time
they
continue
their
noise
,
and
even
endeavour
to
make
it
more
disagreeable
;
laugh
between
while
,
at
the
thought
of
be
able
to
torment
their
better
with
impunity
<EOS>
Our
"
squire
,
incense
at
the
additional
insult
,
immediately
dispatch
the
servant
,
with
his
compliment
to
colonel
Rigworm
;
request
that
he
would
order
his
black
to
be
quiet
,
as
the
noise
they
make
be
altogether
intolerable
 
to
this
message
,
the
Creole
colonel
reply
,
that
his
horn
have
a
right
to
sound
on
a
common
stair
-
case
;
that
there
they
should
play
for
his
diversion
;
and
that
those
who
do
not
like
the
noise
,
may
look
for
lodging
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
Mr
Bramble
no
sooner
receive
this
reply
than
his
eye
begin
to
glisten
,
his
face
grow
pale
,
and
his
tooth
chatter
.
<EOS>
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
he
slipt
on
his
shoe
,
without
speak
a
word
,
or
seem
to
feel
any
further
disturbance
from
the
gout
in
his
toe
.
<EOS>
then
,
snatch
his
cane
,
he
open
the
door
and
proceed
to
the
place
where
the
black
trumpeter
be
post
.
<EOS>
there
,
without
further
hesitation
,
he
begin
to
belabour
them
both
;
and
exert
himself
with
such
astonishing
vigour
and
agility
,
that
both
their
head
and
horn
be
break
in
a
twinkling
,
and
they
run
howl
down
stair
to
their
master
's
parlour
door
.
<EOS>
the
"
squire
,
follow
them
<EOS>
half
way
,
call
aloud
,
that
the
colonel
may
hear
him
,
"
go
,
rascal
,
and
tell
your
master
what
I
have
do
;
if
he
think
himself
injure
,
he
know
where
to
come
for
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
as
for
you
,
this
be
but
an
earnest
of
what
you
shall
receive
,
if
ever
you
presume
to
blow
a
horn
again
here
,

"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
retire
to
his
apartment
,
in
expectation
of
hear
from
the
West
Indian
;
but
the
colonel
prudently
decline
any
farther
prosecution
of
the
dispute
.
<EOS>
My
sister
Liddy
be
fright
into
a
fit
,
of
which
she
be
no
sooner
recover
,
than
Mrs
Tabitha
begin
a
lecture
upon
patience
;
which
her
brother
interrupt
with
a
most
significant
grin
,
exclaim
,
"
true
,
sister
,
God
increase
my
patience
and
your
discretion
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
(
add
he
)
<EOS>
what
sort
of
sonata
we
be
to
expect
from
this
overture
,
in
which
the
devil
,
that
preside
over
horrid
sound
,
hath
give
us
such
variation
of
discord
 
<EOS>
the
trampling
of
porter
,
the
creaking
and
crashing
of
trunk
,
the
snarling
of
cur
,
the
scolding
of
woman
,
the
squeaking
and
squalling
of
fiddle
and
hautboy
out
of
tune
,
the
bouncing
of
the
irish
baronet
over
-
head
,
and
the
burst
,
belch
,
and
brattling
of
the
French
-
horn
in
the
passage
(
not
to
mention
the
harmonious
peal
that
still
thunder
from
the
Abby
steeple
)
succeed
one
another
without
interruption
,
like
the
different
part
of
the
same
concert
,
have
give
me
such
an
idea
of
what
a
poor
invalid
have
to
expect
in
this
temple
,
dedicate
to
Silence
and
Repose
,
that
I
shall
certainly
shift
my
quarter
to
-
morrow
,
and
endeavour
to
effectuate
my
retreat
before
Sir
Ulic
open
the
ball
with
my
lady
Mac
Manus
;
a
conjunction
that
bode
me
no
good
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
intimation
be
by
no
mean
agreeable
to
Mrs
Tabitha
,
whose
ear
be
not
quite
so
delicate
as
those
of
her
brother
 
<EOS>
She
say
it
would
be
a
great
folly
to
move
from
such
agreeable
lodging
,
the
moment
they
be
comfortably
settle
.
<EOS>
She
wonder
he
should
be
such
an
enemy
to
musick
and
mirth
.
<EOS>
She
hear
no
noise
but
of
his
own
making
:
it
be
impossible
to
manage
a
family
in
dumb
-
shew
.
<EOS>
He
may
harp
as
long
as
he
please
upon
her
scolding
;
but
she
never
scold
,
except
for
his
advantage
;
but
he
would
never
be
satisfied
,
even
tho'f
she
should
sweat
blood
and
water
in
his
service
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
notion
that
our
aunt
,
who
be
now
decline
into
the
most
desperate
state
of
celibacy
have
form
some
design
upon
the
heart
of
Sir
Ulic
Mackilligut
,
which
she
fear
may
be
frustrate
by
our
abrupt
departure
from
these
lodging
.
<EOS>
Her
brother
,
eye
her
askance
,
"
pardon
me
,
sister
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
I
should
be
a
savage
,
indeed
,
be
I
insensible
of
my
own
felicity
,
in
have
such
a
mild
,
complacent
,
good
-
humoured
,
and
considerate
companion
and
house
-
keeper
;
but
as
I
have
get
a
weak
head
,
and
my
sense
of
hearing
be
painfully
acute
,
before
I
have
recourse
to
plug
of
wool
and
cotton
,
I
will
try
whether
I
can
not
find
another
lodging
,
where
I
shall
have
more
quiet
and
less
musick
.
"
<EOS>
He
accordingly
dispatch
his
man
upon
this
service
;
and
next
day
he
find
a
small
house
in
Milsham
-
street
,
which
he
hire
by
the
week
.
<EOS>
here
,
at
least
,
we
enjoy
covenience
and
quiet
within
door
,
as
much
as
Tabby
's
temper
will
allow
;
but
the
"
squire
still
complain
of
fly
pain
in
the
stomach
and
head
,
for
which
he
bathe
and
drink
the
water
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
so
bad
,
however
,
but
that
he
go
in
person
to
the
pump
,
the
room
,
and
the
coffee
-
house
;
where
he
pick
up
continual
food
for
ridicule
and
satire
.
<EOS>
if
I
can
glean
any
thing
for
your
amusement
,
either
from
his
observation
or
my
own
,
you
shall
have
it
freely
though
I
be
afraid
it
will
poorly
compensate
the
trouble
of
read
these
tedious
insipid
letter

<EOS>
DEAR
DOCTOR
,
if
I
do
not
know
that
the
exercise
of
your
profession
have
habituate
you
to
the
hearing
of
complaint
,
I
should
make
a
conscience
of
trouble
you
with
my
correspondence
,
which
may
be
truly
call
the
lamentation
of
Matthew
Bramble
.
<EOS>
yet
I
can
not
help
think
,
I
have
some
right
to
discharge
the
overflowing
of
my
spleen
upon
you
,
whose
province
it
be
to
remove
those
disorder
that
occasion
it
;
and
let
me
tell
you
,
it
be
no
small
allevation
of
my
grievance
,
that
I
have
a
sensible
friend
to
whom
I
can
communicate
my
crusty
humour
,
which
,
by
retention
,
would
grow
intolerably
acrimonious
.
    
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
I
find
nothing
but
disappointment
at
Bath
;
which
be
so
altered
,
that
I
can
scarce
believe
it
be
the
same
place
that
I
frequent
about
thirty
year
ago
.
<EOS>
methink
<EOS>
I
hear
you
say
,
"
alter
it
be
,
without
all
doubt
;
but
then
it
be
alter
for
the
well
;
a
truth
which
,
perhaps
you
would
own
without
hesitation
,
if
you
yourself
be
not
alter
for
the
bad
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
reflection
may
,
for
aught
I
know
,
be
just
.
<EOS>
the
inconvenience
which
I
overlook
in
the
high
-
day
of
health
,
will
naturally
strike
with
exaggerated
impression
on
the
irritable
nerve
of
an
invalid
,
surprise
by
premature
old
age
,
and
shatter
with
long
-
suffer
 
<EOS>
but
,
I
believe
,
you
will
not
deny
,
that
this
place
,
which
Nature
and
Providence
seem
to
have
intend
as
a
resource
from
distemper
and
disquiet
,
be
become
the
very
centre
of
racket
and
dissipation
.
<EOS>
instead
of
that
peace
,
tranquillity
and
ease
,
so
necessary
to
those
who
labour
under
bad
health
,
weak
nerve
,
and
irregular
spirit
;
here
we
have
nothing
but
noise
,
tumult
,
and
hurry
;
with
the
fatigue
and
slavery
of
maintain
a
ceremonial
,
more
stiff
,
formal
,
and
oppressive
,
than
the
etiquette
of
a
german
elector
.
<EOS>
a
national
hospital
it
may
be
;
but
one
would
imagine
,
that
none
but
lunatick
be
admit
;
and
truly
,
I
will
give
you
leave
to
call
me
so
,
if
I
stay
much
longer
at
Bath
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
shall
take
another
opportunity
to
explain
my
sentiment
at
great
length
on
this
subject
  
<EOS>
I
be
impatient
to
see
the
boasted
improvement
in
architecture
,
for
which
the
upper
part
of
the
town
have
be
so
much
celebrated
,
and
,
t'other
day
I
make
a
circuit
of
all
the
new
building
.
<EOS>
the
Square
,
though
irregular
,
be
,
on
the
whole
pretty
well
lay
out
,
spacious
,
open
,
and
airy
;
and
,
in
my
opinion
,
by
far
the
most
wholsome
and
agreeable
situation
in
Bath
,
especially
the
upper
side
of
it
;
but
the
avenue
to
it
be
mean
,
dirty
,
dangerous
,
and
indirect
.
<EOS>
Its
communication
with
the
Baths
,
be
through
the
yard
of
an
inn
,
where
the
poor
tremble
valetudinarian
be
carry
in
a
chair
,
betwixt
the
heel
of
a
double
row
of
horse
,
wince
under
the
curry
-
comb
of
groom
and
postilion
,
over
and
above
the
hazard
of
be
obstruct
,
or
overturn
by
the
carriage
which
be
continually
make
their
exit
or
their
entrance
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
after
some
chairman
shall
have
be
maim
,
and
a
few
life
lose
by
those
accident
,
the
corporation
will
think
in
earnest
about
provide
a
more
safe
and
commodious
passage
.
<EOS>
the
Circus
be
a
pretty
banble
;
contrive
for
shew
,
and
look
like
Vespasian
's
amphitheatre
turn
outside
in
.
<EOS>
if
we
consider
it
in
point
of
magnificence
,
the
great
number
of
small
door
belong
to
the
separate
house
,
the
inconsiderable
height
of
the
different
order
,
the
affected
ornament
of
the
architrave
,
which
be
both
childish
and
misplace
,
and
the
area
project
into
the
street
,
surround
with
iron
rail
,
destroy
a
good
part
of
its
effect
upon
the
eye
;
and
,
perhaps
,
we
shall
find
it
still
more
defective
,
if
we
view
it
in
the
light
of
convenience
.
<EOS>
the
figure
of
each
seperate
dwelling
house
,
be
the
segment
of
a
circle
,
must
spoil
the
symmetry
of
the
room
,
by
contract
them
towards
the
street
window
,
and
leave
a
large
sweep
in
the
space
behind
.
<EOS>
if
instead
of
the
area
and
iron
rail
,
which
seem
to
be
of
very
little
use
,
there
have
be
a
corridore
with
arcade
all
round
,
as
in
Covent
-
Garden
,
the
appearance
of
the
whole
would
have
be
more
magnificent
and
striking
;
those
arcade
would
have
afford
an
agreeable
covered
walk
,
and
shelter
the
poor
chairman
and
their
carriage
from
the
rain
,
which
be
here
almost
perpetual
.
<EOS>
at
present
,
the
chair
stand
soak
in
the
open
street
,
from
morning
to
night
,
till
they
become
so
many
box
of
weat
leather
,
for
the
benefit
of
the
gouty
and
rheumatic
,
who
be
transport
in
them
from
place
to
place
.
<EOS>
indeed
this
be
a
shocking
inconvenience
,
that
extend
over
the
whole
city
;
and
,
I
be
persuade
,
it
produce
infinite
mischief
to
the
delicate
and
infirm
;
even
the
close
chair
,
contrive
for
the
sick
,
by
stand
in
the
open
air
,
have
their
frize
lining
impregnate
like
so
many
spunge
,
with
the
moisture
of
the
atmosphere
,
and
those
case
of
cold
vapour
must
give
a
charming
check
to
the
perspiration
of
a
patient
,
pipe
hot
from
the
Bath
,
with
all
his
pore
wide
open
.
    
<EOS>
but
,
to
return
to
the
Circus
:
it
be
inconvenient
from
its
situation
,
at
so
great
a
distance
from
all
the
market
,
bath
,
and
place
of
public
entertainment
.
<EOS>
the
only
entrance
to
it
,
through
Gay
-
street
,
be
so
difficult
,
steep
,
and
slippery
,
that
,
in
wet
weather
,
it
must
be
exceedingly
dangerous
,
both
for
those
that
ride
in
carriage
,
and
those
that
walk
a
-
foot
;
and
when
the
street
be
cover
with
snow
,
as
it
be
for
fifteen
day
<EOS>
successively
this
very
winter
,
I
do
not
see
how
any
individual
could
go
either
up
or
down
,
without
the
most
imminent
hazard
of
broken
bone
.
<EOS>
in
blow
weather
,
I
be
tell
,
most
of
the
house
in
this
hill
be
smother
with
smoke
,
force
down
the
chimney
,
by
the
gust
of
wind
reverberate
from
the
hill
behind
,
which
(
I
apprehend
likewise
)
must
render
the
atmosphere
here
more
humid
and
unwholsome
than
it
be
in
the
square
below
;
for
the
cloud
,
form
by
the
constant
evaporation
from
the
bath
and
river
in
the
bottom
,
will
,
in
their
ascent
this
way
,
be
first
attract
and
detain
by
the
hill
that
rise
close
behind
the
Circus
,
and
load
the
air
with
a
perpetual
succession
of
vapour
:
this
point
,
however
,
may
be
easily
ascertain
by
mean
of
an
hygrometer
,
or
a
paper
of
salt
of
tartar
expose
to
the
action
of
the
atmosphere
.
<EOS>
the
same
artist
,
who
plan
the
Circus
,
have
likewise
project
a
Crescent
;
when
that
be
finish
,
we
shall
probably
have
a
star
;
and
those
who
be
live
thirty
year
hence
,
may
perhaps
,
see
all
the
sign
of
the
Zodiac
exhibit
in
architecture
at
Bath
.
<EOS>
these
,
however
fantastical
,
be
still
design
that
denote
some
ingenuity
and
knowledge
in
the
architect
;
but
the
rage
of
building
have
lay
hold
on
such
a
number
of
adventurer
,
that
one
see
new
house
start
up
in
every
outlet
and
every
corner
of
Bath
;
contrive
without
judgment
,
execute
without
solidity
,
and
stick
together
with
so
little
regard
to
plan
and
propriety
,
that
the
different
line
of
the
new
row
and
building
interfere
with
,
and
intersect
one
another
in
every
different
angle
of
conjunction
.
<EOS>
They
look
like
the
wreck
of
street
and
square
disjoint
by
an
earthquake
,
which
hath
break
the
ground
into
a
variety
of
hole
and
hillock
;
or
,
as
if
some
gothic
devil
have
stuff
them
altogether
in
a
bag
,
and
leave
them
to
stand
higgledy
piggledy
,
just
as
chance
direct
.
<EOS>
what
sort
of
a
monster
Bath
will
become
in
a
few
year
,
with
those
grow
excrescence
,
may
be
easily
conceive
:
but
the
want
of
beauty
and
proportion
be
not
the
bad
effect
of
these
new
mansion
;
they
be
build
so
slight
,
with
the
soft
crumble
stone
find
in
this
neighbourhood
,
that
I
should
never
sleep
quietly
in
one
of
them
,
when
it
blow
(
as
the
sailor
say
)
a
cap
-
full
of
wind
;
and
,
I
be
persuade
,
that
my
hind
,
Roger
Williams
,
or
any
man
of
equal
strength
,
would
be
able
to
push
his
foot
through
the
strong
part
of
their
wall
,
without
any
great
exertion
of
his
muscle
.
<EOS>
all
these
absurdity
arise
from
the
general
tide
of
luxury
,
which
hath
overspread
the
nation
,
and
sweep
away
all
,
even
the
very
dreg
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
every
upstart
of
fortune
,
harnasse
in
the
trapping
of
the
mode
,
present
himself
at
Bath
,
as
in
the
very
focus
of
observation
  
clerk
and
factor
from
the
East
Indies
,
load
with
the
spoil
of
plundered
province
;
planter

,
and
huckster

from
our
american
plantation

not
how

commissary

and
contractor
,
who
have
fatten
,
in
two
successive
war
,
on
the
blood
of
the
nation
;
usurer
,
broker
,
and
jobber
of
every
kind
;
man
of
low
birth
,
and
no
breeding
,
have
find
themselves
suddenly
translate
into
a
state
of
affluence
,
unknown
to
former
age
;
and
no
wonder
that
their
brain
should
be
intoxicate
with
pride
,
vanity
,
and
presumption
.
<EOS>
know
no
other
criterion
of
greatness
,
but
the
ostentation
of
wealth
,
they
discharge
their
affluence
without
taste
or
conduct
,
through
every
channel
of
the
most
absurd
extravagance
:
and
all
of
them
hurry
to
Bath
because
here
,
without
any
further
qualification
,
they
can
mingle
with
the
prince
and
noble
of
the
land
.
<EOS>
even
the
wife

daughter
of
low
tradesman
,
who
,
like
shovel

nosed
shark
,
prey
upon
the
blubber
of
those
uncouth
whale
of
fortune
,
be
infect
with
the
same
rage
of
display
their
importance
;
and
the
slight
indisposition
serve
them
for
a
pretext
to
insist
upon
be
convey

conform
to
the
vulgar
rule
of
a

house
;
the

therefore
,
must
provide
an
entire
house

elegant
apartment

building

<EOS>
such
be
the
composition
of
what
be
call
the
fashionable
company
at
Bath
;
where
a
very
inconsiderable
proportion
of
genteel
people
be
lose
in
a
mob
of
impudent
plebeian
,
who
have
neither
understanding
nor
judgment

nor
the

idea
of
propriety

decorum
;

seem
to
enjoy
nothing
so
much
as
an
opportunity

insult
their
better
.
    
<EOS>
thus
the
number

the
number
of

continue
to
increase
;
and
this
will
ever
be
the
case
,
till
the
stream
that
swell
this
irresistible
torrent
of
folly
and
extravagance
,
shall
either
be
exhaust
,
or
turn
into
other
channel
,
by
incident
and
event
which
I
do
not

<EOS>
this
,
I
own
,
be
a
subject
on

I
can
not
write

for
the

be
a
monster
I
never
could
abide
,
either
in

head

tail

midriff

or
member
<EOS>
:
I
detest
the
whole
of
it
,
as
a
mass
of
ignorance
,
presumption
,
malice
,
and
brutality
;
and
,
in
this
term
of
reprobation
,
I
include
,
without
respect
of
rank
,
station
,
or
quality
,
all
those
of
both
sex
,
who
affect
its
manner

and
court
its
society

<EOS>
but
I
have
write
till
my

be
crampt

and
my
nausea
begin

return
 
by
your
advice
,
I
send
to
London
a
few
day
ago
for
half
a
pound
of
Gengzeng
;
though
I
doubt
much
,
whether
that
which
come
from
America
be
equally
efficacious
with
what
be
bring
from
the
East
Indies

<EOS>
some
year
ago
,
a
friend
of
mine
pay
sixteen
guinea
for
two
ounce
of
it

and
,
in
six
month
after

it
be
sell
in
the

for
five
shilling
the
pound
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
we
live
in
a
vile
world
of
fraud
and
sophistication

so
that
I
know
nothing
of
equal
value
with
the
genuine

of
a
sensible

a
rare
jewel

<EOS>
which
I

to

<EOS>
I
shall

<EOS>
the

put
you
in
mind
of
the
sumptuous

the

such
as
prince

<EOS>
at
eight
in
the
morning
,
we
go
in
dishabille
to
the
pump
-
room
;
which
be
crowd
like
a
Welsh
fair
;
and
there
you
see
the
high
quality
,
and
the
low
trade
folk
,
jostle
each
other
,
without
ceremony
,
hail
fellow
well
meet
.
<EOS>
the
noise
of
the
musick
playing
in
the
gallery
,
the
heat
and
flavour
of
such
a
crowd
,
and
the
hum
and
buz
of
their
conversation
,
give
me
the
head
-
ach
and
virtigo
the
first
day
;
but
afterwards
,
all
these
thing
become
familiar
,
and
even
agreeable
.
  
<EOS>
right
under
the
Pump
room
window
be
the
King
's
Bath
;
a
huge
cistern
,
where
you
see
the
patient
up
to
their
neck
in
hot
water
.
<EOS>
the
lady
wair
jacket
and
petticoat
of
brown
linen
,
with
chip
hat
,
in
which
they
fix
their
handkerchief
to
wipe
the
sweat
from
their
face
;
but
,
truly
,
whether
it
be
owe
to
the
steam
that
surround
them
,
or
the
heat
of
the
water
,
or
the
nature
of
the
dress
,
or
to
all
these
cause
together
,
they
look
so
flushed
,
and
so
frightful
,
that
I
always
turn
my
eye
another
way
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
who
say
every
person
of
fashion
should
make
her
appearance
in
the
bath
,
as
well
as
in
the
abby
church
,
contrive
a
cap
with
cherry
-
coloured
riband
to
suit
her
complection
,
and
oblige
Win
to
attend
her
yesterday
morning
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
but
really
,
her
eye
be
so
red
,
that
they
make
mine
water
as
I
view
her
from
the
pump
-
room
;
and
as
for
poor
Win
,
who
wear
a
hat
trim
with
blue
,
what
betwixt
her
wan
complection
and
her
fear
,
she
look
like
the
ghost
of
some
pale
maiden
,
who
have
drown
herself
for
love
.
<EOS>
when
she
come
out
of
the
bath
,
she
take
assafoetida
drop
,
and
be
flutter
all
day
;
so
that
we
could
hardly
keep
her
from
go
into
hysteric
:
but
her
mistress
say
it
will
do
her
good
;
and
poor
Win
curtsy
,
with
the
tear
in
her
eye
.
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
content
myself
with
drink
about
half
a
pint
of
the
water
every
morning
.
    
<EOS>
the
pumper
,
with
his
wife
and
servant
,
attend
within
a
bar
;
and
the
glass
,
of
different
size
,
stand
range
in
order
before
them
,
so
that
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
point
at
that
which
you
choose
,
and
it
be
fill
immediately
,
hot
and
sparkle
from
the
pump
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
only
hot
water
I
could
ever
drink
,
without
be
sick
 
far
from
have
that
effect
,
it
be
rather
agreable
to
the
taste
,
grateful
to
the
stomach
,
and
revive
to
the
spirit
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
imagine
what
wonderful
cure
it
perform
 
My
uncle
begin
with
it
the
other
day
;
but
he
make
wry
face
in
drinking
,
and
I
be
afraid
he
will
leave
it
off
 
<EOS>
the
first
day
we
come
to
Bath
,
he
fall
into
a
violent
passion
;
beat
two
black
-
a
-
moor
,
and
I
be
afraid
he
would
have
fight
with
their
master
;
but
the
stranger
prove
a
peaceable
man
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
the
gout
have
get
into
his
head
,
as
my
aunt
observe
:
<EOS>
but
,
I
believe
,
his
passion
drive
it
away
;
for
he
have
be
remarkably
well
ever
since
.
<EOS>
it
be
a
thousand
pity
he
should
ever
be
trouble
with
that
ugly
distemper
;
for
,
when
he
be
free
from
pain
,
he
be
the
best
tempered
man
upon
earth
;
so
gentle
,
so
generous
,
so
charitable
,
that
every
body
love
him
;
and
so
good
to
me
<EOS>
,
in
particular
,
that
I
shall
never
be
able
to
shew
the
deep
sense
I
have
of
his
tenderness
and
affection
.
    
<EOS>
Hard
by
the
pump
room
,
be
a
coffee
house
for
the
lady
;
but
my
aunt
say
,
young
girl
be
not
admit
,
inasmuch
as
the
conversation
turn
upon
politic
,
scandal
,
philosophy
,
and
other
subject
above
our
capacity
;
but
we
be
allow
to
accompany
them
to
the
bookseller
shop
,
which
be
charming
place
of
resort
;
where
we
read
novel
,
play
,
pamphlet
,
and
news
paper
,
for
so
small
a
subscription
as
a
crown
a
quarter
;
and
in
these
office
of
intelligence
,
(
as
my
brother
call
them
)
all
the
report
of
the
day
,
and
all
the
private
transaction
of
the
Bath
,
be
first
enter
and
discuss
.
<EOS>
from
the
bookseller
's
shop
,
we
make
a
tour
through
the
milliner
and
toy
-
man
;
and
commonly
stop
at
Mr
Gill
's
,
the
pastry
-
cook
,
to
take
a
jelly
,
a
tart
,
or
a
small
bason
of
vermicelli
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
moreover
,
another
place
of
entertainment
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
,
opposite
to
the
Grove
;
to
which
the
company
cross
over
in
a
boat
 
<EOS>
It
be
call
Spring
Garden
;
a
sweet
retreat
,
lay
out
in
walk
and
pond
,
and
parterre
of
flower
;
and
there
be
a
long
room
for
breakfasting
and
dancing
.
<EOS>
as
the
situation
be
low
and
damp
,
and
the
season
have
be
remarkably
wet
,
my
uncle
will
not
suffer
me
to
go
thither
,
lest
I
should
catch
cold
:
but
my
aunt
say
it
be
all
a
vulgar
prejudice
;
and
,
to
be
sure
,
a
great
many
gentleman
and
lady
of
Ireland
frequent
the
place
,
without
seem
to
be
the
bad
for
it
.
<EOS>
They
say
,
dance
at
Spring
Gardens
,
when
the
air
be
moist
,
be
recommend
to
them
as
an
excellent
cure
for
the
rheumatism
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
twice
at
the
play
;
where
,
notwithstanding
the
excellence
of
the
performer
,
the
gaiety
of
the
company
,
and
the
decoration
of
the
theatre
,
which
be
very
fine
,
I
could
not
help
reflect
,
with
a
sigh
,
upon
our
poor
homely
representation
at
Gloucester
 
<EOS>
but
this
,
in
confidence
to
my
dear
Willis
 
<EOS>
You
know
my
heart
and
will
excuse
its
weakness
.
     
<EOS>
after
all
,
the
great
scene
of
entertainment
at
Bath
,
be
the
two
public
room
;
where
the
company
meet
alternately
every
evening
 
<EOS>
They
be
spacious
,
lofty
,
and
when
light
up
,
appear
very
striking
.
<EOS>
They
be
generally
crowd
with
well
-
dress
people
,
who
drink
tea
in
seperate
party
,
play
at
card
,
walk
,
or
sit
and
chat
together
,
just
as
they
be
dispose
.
<EOS>
twice
a
week
there
be
a
ball
;
the
expence
of
which
be
defray
by
a
voluntary
subscription
among
the
gentleman
;
and
every
subscriber
have
three
ticket
.
<EOS>
I
be
there
Friday
last
with
my
aunt
,
under
the
care
of
my
brother
,
who
be
a
subscriber
;
and
Sir
Ulic
Mackilligut
recommend
his
nephew
,
captain
O
Donaghan
,
to
me
as
a
partner
;
but
Jery
excuse
himself
,
by
say
I
have
get
the
head
-
ach
;
and
,
indeed
<EOS>
,
it
be
really
so
,
though
I
can
not
imagine
how
he
know
it
.
<EOS>
the
place
be
so
hot
,
and
the
smell
so
different
from
what
we
be
use
to
in
the
country
,
that
I
be
quite
feverish
when
we
come
away
.
<EOS>
Aunt
say
it
be
the
effect
of
a
vulgar
constitution
,
rear
among
wood
and
mountain
;
and
,
that
as
I
become
accustomed
to
genteel
company
,
it
will
wear
off
 
<EOS>
Sir
Ulic
be
very
complaisant
,
make
her
a
great
many
high
-
fly
compliment
;
and
when
we
retire
,
hand
her
with
great
ceremony
to
her
chair
.
<EOS>
the
captain
,
I
believe
,
would
have
do
me
the
same
favour
;
but
my
brother
,
see
him
advance
,
take
me
under
his
arm
,
and
wish
him
good
-
night
.
<EOS>
the
captain
be
a
pretty
man
,
to
be
sure
;
tall
and
strait
,
and
well
make
;
with
light
-
grey
eye
,
and
a
roman
nose
;
but
there
be
a
certain
boldness
in
his
look
and
manner
,
that
put
one
out
of
countenance
  
<EOS>
but
I
be

and
afterwards
make

but
mistress

,
if
I

I

and
so
remembre
how
it
work
Mrs

I
choose
rather
to
go
again
with
her
into
the

and
then
I
meet
with
an
axident
.
<EOS>
I
dropt
my

and
could
not

<EOS>
but
what
do
that
signify
?
<EOS>
they
mought
laff

but
they

for
I
be
up

<EOS>
to

it
throw
me
into
such
a

,
that
I

and
rapt

<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
scoulde
a

but
she

Mr

I
be

generous
 
<EOS>
but
you

I

and
so
he
be

to

be
very

for

truly

I

to
 
<EOS>
as
for
John

<EOS>
I
vow
<EOS>
,
I
think
he
would

because
he
axe
me

I
am
astonished

that

him
to
give
away
Alderney

without
my
privity
and
concurrant
 
<EOS>
what
signify
my

order
?
<EOS>
My
brother
be
little
well
than
Noncompush

<EOS>
He
would
give
away
the
shirt
off
his
back
,
and
the
tooth
out
of
his
head
;
nay
,
as
for
that

he
would
have
ruinate
the

if
it

between

his

his

and
his

I
lead
the

an
indent
slave

<EOS>
Alderney
give
four
gallon
a

day
,
ever
since
the
calf
be
send
to
market
.
<EOS>
there
be
so
much
milk
out
of
my
dairy
,
and
the
press
must
stand
still
:
but
I
will
not
loose
a
cheese
paring
;
and
the
milk
shall
be
make
good
,
if
the
sarvent
should
go
without
butter
.
<EOS>
if
they
must
needs
have
butter
,
let
them
make
it
of
sheep
's
milk
;
but
then
my
wool
will
suffer
for
want
of
grace
;
so
that
I
must
be
a
looser
on
all
side
 
<EOS>
well
,
patience
be
like
a
stout
Welsh
poney
;
it
bear
a
great
deal
,
and
trot
a
great
way
;
but
it
will
tire
at
the
long
run
.
<EOS>
before
its
long
,
perhaps
I
may
shew
Matt
,
that
I
be
not
bear
to
be
the
household
drudge
to
my
die
day
 
<EOS>
Gwyn
rite
from
Crickhowel
,
that
the
price
of
flannel
be
fall
three
-
farthing
an

and
that
be
another
good
penny
out
of
my
pocket
 
<EOS>
when
I
go
to
market
to
sell
,
my
commodity
stink
;
but
when
I
want
to
buy
the
common
thing
,
the
owner
prick
it
up
under
my
nose
;
and
it
can
not
be
have
for
love
nor
money
 
<EOS>
I
think
every
thing
run
cross
at
Brambleton
-
hall
  
<EOS>
You
say
the
gander
have
break
the
egg
,
which
be
a
phinumenon
I
do
not
understand
;
for
when
the
fox
carry
off
the
old
goose
last
year
,
he
take
her
place
,
and
hatch
the
egg
,
and
partecte
the
gosling
like
a
tender
parent
 
<EOS>
then
you
tell
me
the
thunder
have
sour
two
barrel
of
beer
in
the
seller
.
<EOS>
but
how
the
thunder
should
get
there
,
when
the
seller
be
double

lock
,
I
can
not
comprehend
.
<EOS>
howsomever
,
I
will
not
have
the
beer
throw
out
,
till
I
see
it
with
my
own
eye
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
it
will
recover
 
at
least
it
will
serve
for
vinegar
to
the
sarvent
.
<EOS>
You
may
leave
off
the
fire
in
my
brother
's
chamber
and
mine
,
as
it
be
unsartain
when
we
return
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
,
Gwyllim
,
you
will
take
care
there
be
no
waste
;
and
have
an
eye
to
the
maid
,
and
keep
them
to
their
spinning
.
<EOS>
I
think
they
may
go
very
well
without
beer
in
hot
weather
 
<EOS>
It
serve
only
to
inflame
the
blood
and
set
them
a

<EOS>
water
will
make

<EOS>
to
Dr
Lewis

<EOS>
dear
DICK
,
I
have
do
with
the
water
;
therefore
your
advice
come
a
day
too
late
 
<EOS>
I
grant
<EOS>
that
physick
be
no
mystery
of
your
making
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
be
a
mystery
in
its
own
nature
;
and
,
like
other
mystery
,
require
a
strong
gulp
of
faith
to
make
it
go
down
  
<EOS>
two
day
ago
,
I
go
into
the
King
's
Bath
,
by
the
advice
of
our
friend
Ch
#
#
#
#
,
in
order
to
clear
the
strainer
of
the
skin
,
for
the
benefit
of
a
free
perspiration
;
and
the
first
object
that
salute
my
eye
,
be
a
child
full
of
scrophulous
ulcer
,
carry
in
the
arm
of
one
of
the
guide
,
under
the
very
nose
of
the
bather
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
shocked
at
the
sight
,
that
I
retire
immediately
with
indignation
and
disgust
 
<EOS>
suppose
the
matter
of
those
ulcer
,
float
on
the
water
,
come
in
contact
with
my
skin
,
when
the
pore
be
all
open
,
I
would
ask
you
what
must
be
the
consequence
?
  
<EOS>
Good
Heaven
,
the
very
thought
make
my
blood
run
cold
;
we
know
not
what
sorea
may
be
run
into
the
water
while
we
be
bathe
,
and
what
sort
of
matter
we
may
thus
imbibe
;
the
king's
-
evil
,
the
scurvy
,
the
cancer
,
and
the
pox
;
and
,
no
doubt
,
the
heat
will
render
the
virus
the
more
volatile
and
penetrate
.
<EOS>
to
purify
myself
from
all
such
contamination
,
I
go
to
the
duke
of
Kingston
's
private
Bath
,
and
there
I
be
almost
suffocate
for
want
of
free
air
;
the
place
be
so
small
,
and
the
steam
so
stifle
.
    
<EOS>
after
all
,
if
the
intention
be
no
more
than
to
wash
the
skin
,
I
be
convinced
that
simple
element
be
more
effectual
than
any
water
impregnate
with
salt
and
iron
;
which
,
be
astringent
,
will
certainly
contract
the
pore
,
and
leave
a
kind
of
crust
upon
the
surface
of
the
body
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
now
as
much
afraid
of
drinking
,
as
of
bathing
;
for
,
after
a
long
conversation
with
the
Doctor
,
about
the
construction
of
the
pump
and
the
cistern
,
it
be
very
far
from
be
clear
with
me
,
that
the
patient
in
the
Pump
-
room
do
not
swallow
,
the
scouring
of
the
bather
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
suspect
,
that
there
be
,
or
may
be
,
some
regurgitation
from
the
bath
into
the
cistern
of
the
pump
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
,
what
a
delicate
beveridge
be
every
day
quaff
by
the
drinker
;
medicate
with
the
sweat
,
and
dirt
,
and
dandriff
;
and
the
abominable
discharge
of
various
kind
,
from
twenty
different
disease
body
,
parboil
in
the
kettle
below
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
avoid
this
filthy
composition
,
I
have
recourse
to
the
spring
that
supply
the
private
bath
on
the
Abbey
-
green
;
but
I
at
once
perceive
something
extraordinary
in
the
taste
and
smell
;
and
,
upon
inquiry
,
I
find
that
the
roman
bath
in
this
quarter
,
be
find
cover
by
an
old
burying
ground
,
belong
to
the
Abbey
;
thro
'
which
,
in
all
probability
,
the
water
drain
in
its
passage
.
<EOS>
so
that
as
we
drink
the
decoction
of
live
body
at
the
pump
-
room
,
we
swallow
the
straining
of
rotten
bone
and
carcase
at
the
private
bath
 
<EOS>
I
vow
to
God
<EOS>
,
the
very
idea
turn
my
stomach
!
 
<EOS>
determine
,
as
I
be
,
against
any
farther
use
of
the
Bath
water
,
this
consideration
would
give
me
little
disturbance
,
if
I
could
find
any
thing
more
pure
,
or
less
pernicious
,
to
quench
my
thirst
;
but
,
although
the
natural
spring
of
excellent
water
be
see
gush
spontaneous
on
every
side
,
from
the
hill
that
surround
us
,
the
inhabitant
in
general
,
make
use
of
well
-
water
,
so
impregnate

It

You

the

she

find

He

for

her
paramour

I
do
not

her
conduct
in
a
proper

for
Liddy

who
have
also
attract
the
notice
of
some
coxcomb

he
suspect

I
shall

keep

DEAR
KNIGHT
,
I
think
those
people
be
unreasonable
,
who
complain
that
Bath
be
a
contract
circle
,
in
which
the
same
dull
scene
perpetually
revolve
,
without
variation
 
<EOS>
I
be
,
on
the
contrary
,
amazed
to
find
so
small
a
place
,
so
crowded
with
entertainment
and
variety
.
<EOS>
London
itself
can
hardly
exhibit
one
specie
of
diversion
,
to
which
we
have
not
something
analogous
at
Bath
,
over
and
above
those
singular
advantage
that
be
peculiar
to
the
place
.
<EOS>
here
,
for
example
a
man
have
daily
opportunity
of
see
the
most
remarkable
character
of
the
community
.
<EOS>
He
see
them
in
their
natural
attitude
and
true
colour
;
descend
from
their
pedestal
,
and
divest
of
their
formal
drapery
,
undisguised
by
art
and
affectation
 
here
,
we
have
minister
of
slate
,
judge
,
general
,
bishop
,
projector
,
philosopher
,
wise
,
poet
,
player
,
chemist
,
fiddler
,
and
bussoon
.
<EOS>
if
he
make
any
considerable
stay
in
the
place
,
he
be
sure
of
meet
with
some
particular
friend
,
whom
he
do
not
expect
to
see
;
and
to
me
there
be
nothing
more
agreeable
,
than
such
casual
rencounter
 
another
entertainment
,
peculiar
to
Bath
,
arise
from
the
general
mixture
of
all
degree
assemble
in
our
public
room
,
without
distinction
of
rank
or
fortune
.
<EOS>
this
be
what
my
uncle
reprobate
,
as
a
monstrous
jumble
of
heterogeneous
principle
;
a
vile
mob
of
noise
and
impertinence
,
without
decency
or
subordination
.
<EOS>
but
this
chaos
be
to
me
a
source
of
infinite
amusement
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
extremely
diverted
,
last
ball
-
night
,
to
see
the
Master
of
the
ceremony
lead
,
with
great
solemnity
,
to
the
upper
end
of
the
room
,
<EOS>
an
antiquated
Abigail
,
dress
in
her
lady
's
cast
-
clothe
;
whom
he
(
I
suppose
)
mistake
for
some
countess
just
arrive
at
the
Bath
.
<EOS>
the
ball
be
open
by
a
Scotch
lord
,
with
a
mulatto
heiress
from
St.
Christopher
's
;
and
the
gay
colonel
Tinsel
dance
all
the
evening
with
the
daughter
of
an
eminent
tinman
from
the
borough
of
Southwark
 
<EOS>
yesterday
morning
,
at
the
pump
-
room
,
I
see
a
break
-
winded
Wapping
landlady
squeeze
through
a
circle
of
peer
,
to
salute
her
brandy
merchant
,
who
stand
by
the
window
,
prop'd
upon
crutch
;
and
a
paralytic
attorney
of
Shoe
-
lane
,
in
shufle
up
to
the
bar
,
kick
the
shin
of
the
chancellor
of
England
,
while
his
lordship
,
in
a
cut
bob
,
drink
a
glass
of
water
at
the
pump
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
account
for
my
be
pleased
with
these
incident
,
any
other
way
than
by
say
,
they
be
truly
ridiculous
in
their
own
nature
,
and
serve
to
heighten
the
humour
in
the
farce
of
life
,
which
I
be
determined
to
enjoy
as
long
as
I
can
.
     
<EOS>
those
,
folly
that
move
my
uncle
's
spleen
excite
my
laughter
.
<EOS>
He
be
as
tender
as
a
man
without
a
skin
;
who
can
not
bear
the
slight
touch
without
slinche
.
<EOS>
what
tickle
another
would
give
him
torment
;
and
yet
he
have
what
we
may
call
lucid
interval
,
when
he
be
remarkably
facetious
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
never
know
a
hypochondraic
<EOS>
so
apt
to
be
infect
with
good
-
humour
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
most
risible
misanthrope
I
ever
meet
with
.
<EOS>
a
lucky
joke
,
or
any
ludicrous
incident
,
will
set
him
a
-
laugh
immoderately
,
even
in
one
of
his
most
gloomy
paroxysm
;
and
when
the
laugh
be
over
,
he
will
curse
his
own
imbecility
.
<EOS>
in
converse
with
stranger
,
he
betray
no
mark
of
disquiet
 
<EOS>
He
be
splenetic
with
his
familiar
only
;
and
not
even
with
them
,
while
they
keep
his
attention
employ
;
but
when
his
spirit
be
not
exert
externally
,
they
seem
to
recoil
and
to
prey
upon
himself
 
<EOS>
He
have
renounce
the
water
with
execration
;
but
he
begin
to
find
a
more
efficacious
,
and
,
certainly
,
a
much
more
palatable
remedy
in
the
pleasure
of
society
.
<EOS>
He
have
discover
some
old
friend
,
among
the
invalid
of
Bath
;
and
,
in
particular
,
renew
his
acquaintance
with
the
celebrated
James
Quin
,
who
certainly
do
not
come
here
to
drink
water
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
doubt
,
but
that
I
have
the
strong
curiosity
to
know
this
original
;
and
it
be
gratify
by
Mr
Bramble
,
who
have
have
him
twice
at
our
house
to
dinner
.
    
<EOS>
so
far
as
I
be
able
to
judge
,
Quin
's
character
be
rather
more
respectable
than
it
have
be
generally
represent
.
<EOS>
His
bon
mot
be
in
every
witling
's
mouth
;
but
many
of
them
have
a
rank
flavour
,
which
one
would
be
apt
to
think
be
derive
from
a
natural
grossness
of
idea
.
<EOS>
I
suspect
,
however
,
that
justice
have
not
be
do
the
author
,
by
the
collector
of
those
Quiniania
;
who
have
let
the
good
of
them
slip
through
their
finger
,
and
only
retain
such
as
be
suit
to
the
taste
and
organ
of
the
multitude
.
<EOS>
how
far
he
may
relax
in
his
hour
of
jollity
,
I
can
not
pretend
to
say
;
but
his
general
conversation
be
conduct
by
the
nice
rule
of
propriety
;
and
Mr
James
Quin
be
,
certainly
,
one
the
best
breed
man
in
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
only
a
most
agreeable
companion
;
but
(
as
I
be
credibly
inform
)
a
very
honest
man
;
highly
sum
ceptible
of
friendship
,
warm
steady
,
and
evesgenerous
in
his
attachment
;
disdain
flattery
and
incapable
of
meaness
and
dissimulation
.
<EOS>
be
I
to
judge
,
however
from
Quin
's
eye
alone
<EOS>
I
should
take
him
to
be
proud
,
insolent
,
and
cruel
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
remarkably
severe
and
forbid
in
his
aspect
;
and
,
I
have
be
tell
,
he
be
ever
dispose
to
insult
his
inferior
and
dependant
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
that
report
have
influence
my
opinion
of
his
look
 
<EOS>
You
know
we
be
the
fool
of
prejudice
.
<EOS>
howsoever
that
may
be
,
I
have
as
yet
see
nothing
but
his
favourable
side
:
and
my
uncle
,
who
frequently
confer
with
him
in
a
corner
,
declare
he
be
one
of
the
most
sensible
man
he
ever
know
 
<EOS>
He
seem
to
have
a
reciprocal
regard
for
old
Square
-
toes
,
whom
he
call
by
the
familiar
name
of
Matthew
,
and
often
remind
of
their
old
tavern
-
adventure
:
on
the
other
hand
,
Matthew
's
eye
sparkle
whenever
Quin
make
his
appearance
 
let
him
be
never
so
jarring
and
discordant
,
Quin
put
him
in
tune
;
and
,
like
treble
and
bass
in
the
same
concert
,
they
make
excellent
musick
together
 
<EOS>
T'other
day
,
the
conversation
turn
upon
Shakespeare
,
I
could
not
help
say
,
with
some
emotion
,
that
I
would
give
an
hundred
guinea
to
see
Mr
Quin
act
the
part
of
Falstaff
;
upon
which
,
turn
to
me
with
a
smile
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
would
give
a
thousand
,
young
gentleman
,
(
say
he
)
that
I
could
gratify
your
longing
.
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
and
he
be
perfectly
agree
in
their
estimate
of
life
;
which
Quin
say
,
would
stink
in
his
nostril
,
if
he
do
not
steep
it
in
claret
.
    
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
this
phenomenon
in
his
cup
;
and
have
almost
prevail
upon
my
uncle
to
give
him
a
small
turtle
at
the
Bear
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
I
must
entertain
you
with
an
incident
,
that
seem
to
confirm
the
judgment
of
those
two
cynic
philosopher
.
<EOS>
I
take
the
liberty
to
differ
in
opinion
from
Mr
Bramble
,
when
he
observe
,
that
the
mixture
of
people
in
the
entertainment
of
this
place
be
destructive
of
all
order
and
urbanity
;
that
it
render
the
plebeian
insufferably
arrogant
and
troublesome
,
and
vulgarize
the
deportment
and
sentiment
of
those
who
move
in
the
upper
sphere
of
life
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
such
a
preposterous
coalition
would
bring
us
into
contempt
with
all
our
neighbour
;
and
be
bad
in
fact
than
debase
the
gold
coin
of
the
nation
.
<EOS>
I
argue
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
those
plebeian
who
discover
such
eagerness
to
imitate
the
dress
and
equipage
of
their
superior
,
would
likewise
in
time
,
adopt
their
maxim
and
their
manner
be
polish
by
their
conversation
,
and
refine
by
their
example
,
but
when
I
appeal
to
Mr
Quin
,
and
ask
if
he
do
not
think
that
such
an
unreserved
mixture
would
improve
the
whole
mass
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
(
say
he
)
as
a
plate
of
marmalade
would
improve
a
pan
of
sirreverence
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
I
own
I
be
not
much
conversant
in
high
-
life
,
but
I
have
see
what
be
call
polite
assembly
in
London
and
elswhere
;
that
those
of
Bath
seem
to
be
as
decent
as
any
;
and
that
,
upon
the
whole
,
the
individual
that
compose
it
,
would
not
be
find
deficient
in
good
manner
and
decorum
.
<EOS>
"
but
let
us
have
recourse
to
experience
,
(
say
I
)
  
<EOS>
Jack
Holder

who

intend
for

,
have
succeed
to

of

thousand
a

death

<EOS>

now
at
the
Bath

drive
about
in
a
phaeton

sour

with
french
horn

He
have
treat
with
turtle
and
claret
at
all
the
tavern
in
Bath
and
Bristol
,
till
his
guest
be
gorge
with
good
chear
:
he
have
buy
a
dozen
suit
of
fine
clothe
,
by
the
advice
of
the
Master
of
the
Ceremonies
,
under
whose
tuition
he
have
enter
himself
:
he
have
lose
some
hundred
at
billiard
to
sharper
,
and
take
one
of
the
nymph
of
Avon
-
street
into
keeping
;
but
,
find
all
these
channell
insufficient
to
drain
him
of
his
current
cash
,
his
counsellor
have
engage
him
to
give
a
general
tea
-
drinking
to
-
morrow
at
Wiltshire
's
room
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
give
it
the
more
ecclat
,
every
table
be
to
be
furnish
with
sweet
-
meat
and
nosegay
;
which
,
however
,
be
not
to
be
touch
till
notice
be
give
by
the
ringing
of
a
bell
,
and
then
the
lady
may
help
themselves
without
restriction
.
<EOS>
this
will
be
no
bad
way
of
try
the
company
's
breeding
 
"
    
"
I
will
abide
by
that
experiment
,
(
cry
my
uncle
)
and
if
I
could
find
a
place
to
stand
secure
,
without
the
vortex
of
the
tumult
,
which
I
know
will
ensue
,
I
would
certainly
go
thither
and
enjoy
the
scene
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quin
propose
that
we
should
take
our
station
in
the
musick
-
gallery
;
and
we
take
his
advice
.
<EOS>
Holder
have
get
thither
before
us
,
with
his
horn
perdue
;
but
we
be
admit
.
<EOS>
the
tea
-
drinking
pass
as
usual
;
and
the
company
have
rise
from
the
table
,
be
saunter
in
groupe
,
in
expectation
of
the
signal
for
attack
,
when
the
bell
begin
to
ring
,
they
fly
with
eagerness
to
the
desart
,
and
the
whole
place
be
instantly
in
commotion
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
but
justle
,
scrambling
,
pull
,
snatch
,
struggle
,
scold
,
and
scream
.
<EOS>
the
nosegay
be
tear
from
one
another
's
hand
and
bosom
;
the
glasses
and
china
go
to
wreck
;
the
table
and
floor
be
strew
with
comfit
.
<EOS>
some
cry
;
some
swear
;
and
the
trope
and
figure
of
Billingsgate
be
use
without
reserve
in
all
their
native
zest
and
flavour
;
nor
be
those
flower
of
rhetoric
unattende
with
significant
gesticulation
.
<EOS>
some
snap
their
finger
;
some
fork
them
out
;
some
clap
their
hand
,
and
some
their
back
-
side
;
at
legth
,
they
fairly
proceed
to
pull
cap
,
and
every
thing
seem
to
presage
a
general
battle
;
when
Holder
order
his
horn
to
sound
a
change
with
a
view
to
annimate
the
combatant
,
and
inflame
the
contest
;
but
this
manoeuvre
produce
an
effect
quite
contrary
to
what
he
expect
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
note
of
reproach
that
rouse
them
to
an
immediate
sense
of
their
disgraceful
situation
.
<EOS>
They
be
ashamed
of
their
absurd
deportment
,
and
suddenly
desist
.
<EOS>
They
gather
up
their
cap
,
rustle
,
and
handkerchief
;
and
great
part
of
them
retire
in
silent
mortification
.
    
<EOS>
Quin
laugh
at
this
adventure
;
but
my
uncle
's
delicacy
be
hurt
.
<EOS>
He
hang
his
head
in
manifest
chagrin
,
and
seem
to
repine
at
the
triumph
of
his
judgment
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
his
victory
be
more
complete
than
he
imagine
;
for
,
as
we
afterwards
learn
,
the
two
amazon
who
singularize
themselves
most
in
the
action
,
do
not
come
from
the
purlie
of
puddle

dock
,
but
from
the
courtly
neighbourhood
of
St.
James
's
palace

be

baroness

the
other

wealthy
knight

dowager
 
<EOS>
My

speak
not
a

,
till
we
have
make
our
retreat
good
to
the

where
,
take
off
his
hat

wipe
his

<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
nothing
could
have
keep
her
at

the
accident

her
have
take
physick
before
she
know
the

She
have
be

up

I
have
much
to

she

She

remarkably
civil

of

impertinence

<EOS>
DEAR
LEWIS
,
I
receive
your
bill
upon
Wiltshire
,
which
be
punctually
honour
;
but
as
I
do
not
choose
to
keep
so
much
cash
by
me
,
in
a
common
lodging
-
house
,
I
have
deposit
250l
.
<EOS>
in
the
bank
of
Bath
,
and
shall
take
their
bill
for
it
in
London
,
when
I
leave
this
place
,
where
the
season
draw
to
an
end
  
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
that
now
be
a

I
be

to
give
Liddy
a
glimpse
of
London
.
<EOS>
She
be
one
of
the
good
hearted
creature
I
ever
know
,
and
gain
upon
my
affection
every
day
 
<EOS>
as
for
Tabby
,
I
have
dropt
<EOS>
such
hint
to
the
irish
baronet
,
concern
her
fortune
,
<EOS>
as
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
will
cool
the
iardour
of
his
address
.
<EOS>
then
her
pride
will
take
the
alarm
;
and
the
rancour
of
state
maidenhood
be
chase
,
we
shall
hear
nothing
but
slander
and
abuse
of
Sir
Ulick
Mackilligut
 
<EOS>
this
rupture
,
I
foresee
,
will
facilitate
our
departure
from
Bath
;
where
,
at
present
,
Tabby
seem
to
enjoy
herself
with
peculiar
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
detest
it
so
much
,
that
I
should
not
have
be
able
to
stay
so
long
in
the
place
if
I
have
not
discover
some
old
friend
;
whose
conversation
alleviate
my
disgust
 
go
to
the
coffee
-
house
one
forenoon
,
I
could
not
help
contemplate
the
company
,
with
equal
surprize
and
compassion
 
<EOS>
We
consist
of
thirteen
individual
;
<EOS>
seven
lame
by
the
gout
,
rheumatism
,
or
palsy
;
three
maim
by
accident
;
and
the
rest
either
deaf
or
blind
.
<EOS>
one
hobble
,
another
hopped
,
a
third
drag
his
leg
after
him
like
a
wound
snake
,
a
fourth
straddle
betwixt
a
pair
of
long
crutch
,
like
the
mummy
of
a
felon
hang
in
chain
;
a
fifth
be
bent
into
a
horizontal
position
,
like
a
mounted
telescope
,
shove
in
by
a
couple
of
chairman
;
and
a
sixth
be
the
bust
of
a
man
,
<EOS>
set
upright
in
a
wheel
machine
,
which
the
waiter
move
from
place
to
place
.
    
<EOS>
be
strike
with
some
of
their
face
,
I
consult
the
subscription
book
;
and
,
perceive
the
name
of
several
old
friend
,
begin
to
consider
the
groupe
with
more
attention
.
<EOS>
at
length
I
discover
rear
admiral
Balderick
,
the
companion
of
my
youth
,
whom
I
have
not
see
since
he
be
oppointe
lieutenant
of
the
Severn
.
<EOS>
He
be
metamorphose
into
an
old
man
,
with
a
wooden
leg
and
a
weatherbeaten
face
which
appear
the
more
ancient
from
his
grey
lock
,
that
be
truly
venerable
 
sit
down
at
the
table
,
where
he
be
read
a
newspaper
,
I
gaze
at
him
for
some
minute
,
with
a
mixture
of
pleasure
and
regret
,
which
make
my
heart
gush
with
tenderness
;
then
,
take
him
by
the
hand
,
"
ah
,
Sam
,
(
say
I
)
<EOS>
forty
year
ago
I
little
think
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
too
much
move
to
proceed

"
<EOS>
an
old
friend
,
sure
enough
!
<EOS>
(
cry
he
,
squeeze
my
hand
,
and
survey
me
eagerly
thro
'
his
glass
)
<EOS>
I
know
the
looming
of
the
vessel
,
though
she
have
be
hard
strain
since
we
part
;
but
I
can
not
heave
up
the
name
 
<EOS>
"
the
moment
I
tell
him
who
I
be
,
he
exclaim
,
"
ha
!
Matt
.
<EOS>
my
old
fellow
cruizer
,
still
afloat
!
"
<EOS>
and
,
start
up
,
hug
me
in
his
arm
.
<EOS>
His
transport
,
however
,
bed
me
no
good
;
for
,
in
salute
me
,
he
thrust
the
spring
of
his
spectacle
into
my
eye
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
set
his
wooden
stump
upon
my
gouty
toe
;
an
attack
that
make
me
shed
tear
in
sad
earnest
 
<EOS>
after
the
hurry
of
our
recognition
be
over
,
he
point
out
two
of
our
common
friend
in
the
room
:
<EOS>
the
bust
be
what
remain
of
colonel
Cockril
,
who
have
lose
the
use
of
his
limb
in
make
an
american
campain
;
and
the
telescope
prove
to
be
my
college
chum
,
sir
Reginald
Bently
;
who
,
with
his
new
title
,
and
unexpected
inheritance
,
commence
fox
-
hunter
,
without
have
serve
his
apprenticeship
to
the
mystery
;
and
,
in
consequence
of
follow
the
hound
through
a
river
,
be
seize
with
an
inflammation
in
his
bowel
,
which
have
contract
him
into
his
present
attitude
.
    
<EOS>
Our
former
correspondence
be
forthwith
renew
,
with
the
most
hearty
expression
of
mutual
good
-
will
;
and
as
we
have
meet
so
unexpectedly
,
we
agree
to
dine
together
that
very
day
at
the
tavern
.
<EOS>
My
friend
Quin
,
be
luckily
unengage
,
oblige
us
with
his
company
;
and
,
truly
,
this
be
the
most
happy
day
I
have
pass
these
twenty
year
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
,
Lewis
,
have
be
always
together
,
never
taste
friendship
in
this
high
gout
,
contract
from
long
absence
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
express
the
half
of
what
I
feel
at
this
casual
meeting
of
three
or
four
companion
,
who
have
be
so
long
separate
,
and
so
roughly
treat
by
the
storm
of
life
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
renovation
of
youth
;
a
kind
of
resuscitation
of
the
dead
,
that
realize
those
interesting
dream
,
in
which
we
sometimes
retrieve
our
ancient
friend
from
the
grave
.
<EOS>
perhaps
my
enjoyment
be
not
the
less
pleasing
for
be
mix
with
a
strain
of
melancholy
,
produce
by
the
remembrance
of
past
scene
,
that
conjure
up
the
idea
of
some
endearing
connexion
,
which
the
hand
of
death
have
actually
dissolve
.
    
<EOS>
the
spirit
and
good
humour
of
the
company
seem
to
triumph
over
the
wreck
of
their
constitution
.
<EOS>
They
have
even
philosophy
enough
to
joke
upon
their
own
calamity
;
such
be
the
power
of
friendship
,
the
sovereign
cordial
of
life
 
I
afterwards
find
,
however
,
that
they
be
not
without
their
moment
,
and
even
hour
of
disquiet
.
<EOS>
each
of
them
apart
,
in
succeed
conference
,
expatiate
upon
his
own
particular
grievance
;
and
they
be
all
malecontent
at
bottom
 
over
and
above
their
personal
disaster
,
they
think
themselves
unfortunate
in
the
lottery
of
life
.
<EOS>
Balderick
complain
,
that
all
the
recompense
he
have
receive
for
his
long
and
hard
service
,
be
the
half
-
pay
of
a
rear
admiral
.
<EOS>
the
colonel
be
mortify
to
see
himself
over
-
top
by
upstart
general
,
some
of
whom
he
have
once
command
;
and
,
be
a
man
of
a
liberal
turn
,
could
ill
put
up
with
a
moderate
annuity
,
for
which
he
have
sell
,
his
commission
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
baronet
,
have
run
himself
considerably
in
debt
,
on
a
contest
election
,
he
have
be
oblige
to
relinquish
his
seat
in
parliament
,
and
his
seat
in
the
country
at
the
same
time
,
and
put
his
estate
to
nurse
:
but
his
chagrin
,
which
be
the
effect
of
his
own
misconduct
,
do
not
affect
me
half
so
much
as
that
of
the
other
two
;
who
have
act
honourable
and
distinguished
part
on
the
great
theatre
,
and
be
now
reduce
to
lead
a
weary
life
in
this
stewpan
of
idleness
and
insignificance
.
<EOS>
They
have
long
leave
off
use
the
water
,
after
have
experience
their
inefficacy
.
<EOS>
the
diversion
of
the
place
they
be
not
in
a
condition
to
enjoy
.
<EOS>
how
then
do
they
make
shift
to
pass
their
time
?
<EOS>
in
the
forenoon
,
they
crawl
out
to
the
room
or
the
coffee
-
house
,
where
they
take
a
hand
at
whist
,
or
descant
upon
the
General
Advertiser
;
and
their
evening
they
murder
in
private
party
,
among
peevish
invalid
,
and
insipid
old
woman
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
case
with
a
good
number
of
individual
,
whom
nature
seem
to
have
intend
for
well
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
about
a
dozen
year
ago
,
many
decent
family
,
restrict
to
small
fortune
,
besides
those
that
come
hither
on
the
score
of
health
,
be
tempt
to
settle
at
Bath
,
where
they
could
then
live
comfortably
,
and
even
make
a
genteel
appearance
,
at
a
small
expence
:
but
the
madness
of
the
time
have
make
the
place
too
hot
for
them
,
and
they
be
now
oblige
to
think
of
other
migration
 
some
have
already
flee
to
the
mountain
of
Wales
,
and
other
have
retire
to
Exeter
.
<EOS>
thither
,
no
doubt
,
they
will
be
follow
by
the
flood
of
luxury
and
extravagance
,
which
will
drive
them
from
place
to
place
to
the
very
land
's
end
;
and
there
,
I
suppose
,
they
will
be
oblige
to
ship
themselves
to
some
other
country
.
<EOS>
Bath
be
become
a
mere
sink
of
profligacy
and
extortion
.
<EOS>
every
article
of
house
-
keeping
be
raise
to
an
enormous
price
;
a
circumstance
no
longer
to
be
wonder
at
,
when
we
know
that
every
petty
retainer
of
fortune
pique
himself
upon
keep
a
table
,
and
think
'
tis
for
the
honour
of
his
character
to
wink
at
the
knavery
of
his
servant
,
who
be
in
a
confederacy
with
the
market
-
people
;
and
,
of
consequence
,
pay
whatever
they
demand
.
<EOS>
here
be
now
a
mushroom
of
opulence
,
who
pay
a
cook
seventy
guinea
a
week
for
furnish
him
with
one
meal
a
day
.
<EOS>
this
portentous
frenzy
be
become
so
contagious
,
that
the
very
rabble
and
refuse
of
mankind
be
infect
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
a
negro
-
driver
,
from
Jamaica
,
pay
over
-
night
to
the
master
of
one
of
the
Rooms
,
sixty
-
five
guinea
for
tea
and
coffee
to
the
company
,
and
leave
Bath
next
morning
,
in
such
obscurity
,
that
not
one
of
his
guest
have
the
slight
idea
of
his
person
,
or
even
make
the
least
inquiry
about
his
name
.
<EOS>
incident
of
this
kind
be
frequent
;
and
every
day
teem
with
fresh
absurdity
,
which
be
too
gross
to
make
a
thinking
man
merry
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
feel
the
spleen
creep
on
me
apace
;
and
therefore
will
indulge
you
with
a
cessation
,
that
you
may
have
no
unnecessary
cause
to
curse
your
correspondence
with

to
Miss
Laetitia
Willis

Gloucester

<EOS>
my
dear
letty
,
I
write
you
at
great
length
by
the
post
,
the
twenty
-
sixth
of
last
month
,
to
which
I
refer
you
for
an
account
of
our
proceeding
at
Bath
;
and
I
expect
your
answer
with
impatience
.
<EOS>
but
,
have
this
opportunity
of
a
private
hand
,
I
send
you
two
dozen
of
Bath
-
ring
;
six
of
the
good
of
which
I
desire
you
will
keep
for
yourself
,
and
distribute
the
rest
among
the
young
lady
,
our
common
friend
,
as
you
shall
think
proper
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
you
will
approve
of
the
motto
;
some
of
them
be
not
much
to
my
own
liking
;
but
I
be
oblige
to
take
such
as
I
could
find
ready
manufacture
  
<EOS>
I
be
vex
,
that
neither
you
nor
I
have
receive
any
further
information
of
a
certain
person
  
<EOS>
sure
it
can
not
be
wilful
neglect
!
  
<EOS>
o
my
dear
Willis
!
<EOS>
I
begin
to
be
visit
by
strange
fancy
,
and
to
have
some
melancholy
doubt
;
which
,
however
,
it
would
be
ungenerous
to
harbour
without
further
inquiry
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
who
have
make
me
a
present
of
a
very
fine
set
of
garnet
,
talk
of
treat
us
with
a
jaunt
to
London
;
which
,
you
may
imagine
,
will
be
highly
agreeable
:
<EOS>
but
I
like
Bath
<EOS>
so
well
,
that
I
hope
he
will
not
think
of
leave
it
till
the
season
be
quite
over
;
and
yet
,
betwixt
friend
,
something
have
happen
to
my
aunt
,
which
will
probably
shorten
our
stay
in
this
place
.
    
<EOS>
yesterday
,
in
the
forenoon
,
she
go
by
herself
to
a
breakfasting
in
one
of
the
room
;
and
,
in
half
an
hour
,
return
in
great
agitation
,
have
Chowder
along
with
her
in
the
chair
.
<EOS>
I
believe
some
accident
must
have
happen
to
that
unlucky
animal
,
which
be
the
great
source
of
all
her
trouble
.
<EOS>
dear
Letty
!
<EOS>
what
a
pity
it
be
,
that
a
woman
of
her
year
and
discretion
,
should
place
her
affection
upon
such
an
ugly
,
ill
-
condition
cur
,
that
snarl
and
snap
at
every
body
.
<EOS>
I
ask
John
Thomas
,
the
footman
who
attend
her
,
what
be
the
matter
?
<EOS>
and
he
do
nothing
but
grin
!
<EOS>
a
famous
dog
-
doctor
be
send
for
,
and
undertake
to
cure
the
patient
,
provide
he
may
carry
him
home
to
his
own
house
;
but
his
mistress
would
not
part
with
him
out
of
her
own
sight
 
<EOS>
She
order
the
cook
to
warm
cloth
,
which
she
apply
to
his
bowel
,
with
her
own
hand
.
<EOS>
She
give
up
all
thought
of
go
to
the
ball
in
the
evening
;
and
when
Sir
Ulic
come
to
drink
tea
,
refuse
to
be
see
;
so
that
he
go
away
to
look
for
another
partner
.
<EOS>
My
brother
Jery
whistle
and
dance
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
sometimes
shrug
up
his
shoulder
,
and
sometimes
burst
out
a
-
laughing
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
sobs
and
scold
by
turn
;
and
her
woman
,
Win
.
<EOS>
Jenkins
,
Hatch
and
wonder
with
a
foolish
face
of
curiosity
;
and
,
for
my
part
.
<EOS>
I
be
as
curious
as
she
,
but
ashamed
to
ask
question
.
    
<EOS>
perhaps
time
will
discover
the
mystery
;
for
if
it
be
any
thing
that
happen
in
the
room
,
it
can
not
be
long
conceal
 
<EOS>
all
I
know
be
,
that
last
night
at
supper
,
miss
Bramble
speak
very
disdainfully
of
Sir
Ulic
Mackilligut
,
and
ask
her
brother
if
he
intend
to
keep
us
swelter
all
the
summer
at
Bath
?
"
<EOS>
no
,
sister
Tabitha
,
(
say
he
,
with
an
arch
smile
)
<EOS>
we
shall
retreat
before
the
Dog
day
begin
;
though
I
make
no
doubt
,
that
with
a
little
temperance
and
discretion
,
our
constitution
may
be
keep
cool
enough
all
the
year
,
even
at
Bath
.
<EOS>
"
as
I
do
not
know
the
meaning
of
this
insinuation
,
I
will
not
pretend
to
make
any
remark
upon
it
at
present
:
hereafter
,
perhaps
,
I
may
be
able
to
explain
it
more
to
your
satsifaction
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
I
beg
you
will
be
punctual
in
your
correspondence
,
and
continue
to
love
your
ever
faithful
    
Lydia
Melford
.
    
<EOS>
Bath
,
May
6
.
    
<EOS>
to
Sir
Watkin
Phillips
,
Bart
.
<EOS>
of
Jesus
college
,
Oxon
.
  
<EOS>
so
then
Mrs
Blackerby
's
affair
have
prove
a
false
alarm
,
and
I
have
save
my
money
?
<EOS>
I
wish
,
however
,
her
declaration
have
not
be
so
premature
,
for
though
my
be
think
capable
of
make
her
a
mother
,
may
have
give
me
some
credit
,
<EOS>
the
reputation
of
an
intrigue
with
such
a
cracked
pitcher
do
me
no
honour
at
all
 
<EOS>
in
my
last
I
tell
you
I
have
hope
of
see
Quin
,
in
his
hour
of
elevation
,
at
the
tavern
,
which
be
the
temple
of
mirth
and
good
-
fellowship
;
where
he
,
as
Priest
of
Comus
,
utter
the
inspiration
of
wit
and
humour
  
<EOS>
I
have
have
that
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
I
have
dine
with
his
club
at
the
Three
Tuns
,
and
have
the
honour
to
sit
him
out
.
<EOS>
at
half
an
hour
past
eight
in
the
evening
,
he
be
carry
home
with
six
good
bottle
of
claret
under
his
belt
;
and
it
be
then
Friday
,
he
give
order
that
he
should
not
be
disturb
till
Sunday
at
noon
 
<EOS>
You
must
not
imagine
that
this
dose
have
any
other
effect
upon
his
conversation
,
but
that
of
make
it
more
extravagantly
entertaining
 
He
have
lose
the
use
of
his
limb
,
indeed
,
several
hour
before
we
part
,
but
he
retain
all
his
other
faculty
in
perfection
;
and
as
he
give
vent
to
every
whimsical
idea
as
it
rise
,
I
be
really
astonished
at
the
brilliancy
of
his
thought
,
and
the
force
of
his
expression
.
<EOS>
Quin
be
a
real
voluptuary
in
the
article
of
eating
and
drink
;
and
so
confirm
an
epicure
,
in
the
common
acceptation
of
the
term
,
that
he
can
not
put
up
with
ordinary
fare
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
point
of
such
importance
with
him
,
that
he
always
take
upon
himself
the
charge
of
catering
;
and
a
man
admit
to
his
mess
,
be
always
sure
of
eat
delicate
victual
,
and
drink
excellent
wine
 
<EOS>
He
own
himself
addict
to
the
delight
of
the
stomach
,
and
often
joke
upon
his
own
sensuality
;
but
there
be
nothing
selfish
in
this
appetite
  
<EOS>
He
find
that
good
chear
unite
good
company
;
exhilerate
the
spirit
,
open
the
heart
,
<EOS>
banishe
all
restraint
from
conversation
,
and
promote
the
happy
purpose
of
social
life
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mr
James
Quin
be
not
a
subject
to
be
discuss
in
the
compass
of
one
letter
;
I
shall
therefore
,
at
present
,
leave
him
to
his
repose
,
and
call
another
of
a
very
different
complexion
.
    
<EOS>
You
desire
to
have
further
acquaintance
with
the
person
of
our
aunt
,
and
promise
yourself
much
entertainment
from
her
connexion
with
Sir
Ulic
Mackilligut
:
<EOS>
but
in
this
hope
you
be
baulk
already
;
that
connexion
be
dissolve
.
<EOS>
the
irish
baronet
be
an
old
hound
,
that
find
her
carrion
,
have
quit
the
scent
 
I
have
already
tell
you
,
that
Mrs
Tabitha
Bramble
be
a
maiden
of
forty
-
five
.
<EOS>
in
her
person
,
she
be
tall
,
raw
-
bone
,
aukward
,
flat
-
cheste
,
and
stoop
;
her
complexion
be
sallow
and
freckle
;
her
eye
be
not
grey
,
but
greenish
,
like
those
of
a
cat
,
and
generally
inflame
;
her
hair
be
of
a
sandy
,
or
rather
dusty
hue
;
her
forehead
low
;
her
nose
long
,
sharp
,
and
,
towards
the
extremity
,
always
red
in
cool
weather
;
her
lip
skinny
,
her
mouth
extensive
,
her
tooth
straggle
and
loose
,
of
various
colour
and
conformation
;
and
her
long
neck
shrivel
into
a
thousand
wrinkle
 
<EOS>
in
her
temper
,
she
be
proud
,
stiff
,
vain
,
imperious
,
prying
,
malicious
,
greedy
,
and
uncharitable
.
<EOS>
in
all
likelihood
,
her
natural
austerity
have
be
sour
by
disappointment
in
love
;
for
her
long
celibacy
be
by
no
mean
owe
to
her
dislike
of
matrimony
:
on
the
contrary
,
she
have
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
avoid
the
reproachful
epithet
of
old
maid
.
    
<EOS>
before
I
be
bear
,
she
have
go
such
length
in
the
way
of
flirt
with
a
recruiting
officer
,
that
her
reputation
be
a
little
singed
.
<EOS>
She
afterwards
make
advance
to
the
curate
of
the
parish
,
who
drop
some
distant
hint
about
the
next
presentation
to
the
living
,
which
be
in
her
brother
's
gift
;
but
find
that
be
already
promise
to
another
,
he
fly
off
at
a
tangent
;
and
Mrs
Tabby
,
in
revenge
,
find
mean
to
deprive
him
of
his
cure
.
<EOS>
Her
next
lover
be
lieutenant
of
a
man
of
war
,
a
relation
of
the
family
,
who
do
not
understand
the
refinement
of
the
passion
,
and
express
no
aversion
to
grapple
with
cousin
Tabby
in
the
way
of
marriage
;
but
before
matter
could
be
properly
adjust
,
he
go
out
on
a
cruise
,
and
be
kill
in
an
engagement
with
a
french
frigate
.
<EOS>
Our
aunt
,
though
baffle
so
often
,
do
not
yet
despair
 
<EOS>
She
lay
all
her
-
snare
for
Dr
Lewis
,
who
be
the
fidus
Achates
of
my
uncle
.
<EOS>
She
even
fall
sick
upon
the
occasion
,
and
prevail
with
Matt
to
interpose
in
her
behalf
with
his
friend
;
but
the
Doctor
be
a
shy
cock
,
would
not
be
catch
with
chaff
,
and
flatly
reject
the
proposal
:
so
that
Mrs
Tabitha
be
content
to
exert
her
patience
once
more
,
after
have
endeavour
in
vain
to
effect
a
rupture
betwixt
the
two
friend
;
and
now
she
think
proper
to
be
very
civil
to
Lewis
,
who
be
become
necessary
to
her
in
the
way
of
his
profession
.
    
<EOS>
these
,
however
,
be
not
the
only
effort
she
have
make
towards
a
near
conjunction
with
our
sex
.
<EOS>
Her
fortune
be
originally
no
more
than
a
thousand
pound
;
but
she
gain
an
accession
of
five
hundred
by
the
death
of
a
sister
,
and
the
lieutenant
leave
her
three
hundred
in
his
will
.
<EOS>
these
sum
she
have
more
than
double
,
by
live
free
of
all
expence
,
in
her
brother
's
house
;
and
deal
in
cheese
and
Welsh
flannel
,
the
produce
of
his
flock
and
dairy
.
<EOS>
at
present
her
capital
be
increase
to
about
four
thousand
pound
;
and
her
avarice
seem
to
grow
every
day
more
and
more
rapacious
;
but
even
this
be
not
so
intolerable
,
as
the
perverseness
of
her
nature
,
which
keep
the
whole
family
in
disquiet
and
uproar
.
<EOS>
She
be
one
of
those
genius
who
find
some
diabolical
enjoyment
in
be
dread
and
detest
by
their
fellow
-
creature
.
    
<EOS>
I
once
tell
my
uncle
,
I
be
surprised
that
a
man
of
his
disposition
could
bear
such
a
domestic
plague
,
when
it
could
be
so
easily
remove
 
<EOS>
the
remark
make
him
sore
,
because
it
seem
to
tax
him
with
want
of
resolution
 
wrinkle
up
his
nose
,
and
draw
down
his
eye
-
brow
,
"
a
young
fellow
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
when
he
first
thrust
his
snout
into
the
world
,
be
apt
to
be
surprised
at
many
thing
,
which
a
man
of
experience
know
to
be
ordinary
and
unavoidable
 
this
precious
aunt
of
yours
be
become
insensibly
a
part
of
my
constitution
 
<EOS>
damn
her
!
<EOS>
She
be
a
noli
me
tangere
in
my
flesh
,
which
I
can
not
bear
to
be
touch
or
tamper
with
.
<EOS>
"
I
make
no
reply
;
but
shift
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
He
really
have
an
affection
for
this
original
,
which
maintain
its
ground
in
defiance
of
common
sense
,
and
in
despite
of
that
contempt
which
he
must
certainly
fell
for
her
character
and
understanding
,
Nay
,
I
be
convince
,
that
she
have
likewise
a
most
virulent
attachment
to
his
person
;
though
her
love
never
shew
itself
but
in
the
shape
of
discontent
;
and
she
persist
in
torment
him
out
of
sheer
tenderness
 
<EOS>
the
only
object
within
door
upon
which
she
bestow
any
mark
of
affection
,
in
the
usual
stile
,
be
her
dog
Chowder
;
a
filthy
our
from
Newfoundland
,
which
she
have
in
a
present
from
the
wife
of
a
skipper
in
Swansey
 
<EOS>
one
would
imagine
she
have
distinguish
this
beast
with
her
favour
on
account
of
his
ugliness
and
ill
-
nature
;
if
it
be
not
,
indeed
,
an
instinctive
sympathy
between
his
disposition
and
her
own
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
she
caress
him
without
cease
;
and
even
harrasse
the
family
in
the
service
of
this
curse
animal
,
which
,
indeed
,
have
prove
the
proximate
cause
of
<EOS>
her
breach
with
Sir
Ulic
Mackilligut
.
    
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
she
yesterday
want
to
steal
a
march
of
poor
Liddy
,
and
go
to
breakfast
in
the
Room
without
any
other
companion
than
her
dog
,
in
expectation
of
meeting
with
the
Baronet
,
who
have
agree
to
dance
with
her
in
the
evening
 
Chowder
no
sooner
make
his
appearance
in
the
Room
than
the
master
of
the
Ceremonies
,
incense
at
his
presumption
,
run
up
to
drive
him
away
,
and
threaten
him
with
his
foot
;
but
the
other
seem
to
despise
his
authority
,
and
display
a
formidable
case
of
long
,
white
,
sharp
tooth
,
keep
the
puny
monarch
at
bay
 
while
he
stand
under
some
trepidation
,
front
his
antagonist
,
and
bawl
to
the
waiter
,
Sir
Ulic
Mackilligut
come
to
his
assistance
;
and
seem
ignorant
of
the
connexion
between
this
intruder
and
his
mistress
give
the
former
such
a
kick
in
the
jaw
,
as
send
him
howl
to
the
door
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
incense
at
this
outrage
,
run
after
him
,
squall
in
a
tone
equally
disagreeable
;
while
the
Baronet
follow
her
on
one
side
,
make
apology
for
his
mistake
;
and
Derrick
on
the
other
,
make
remonstrance
upon
the
rule
and
regulation
of
the
place
.
    
<EOS>
far
from
be
satisfied
with
the
Knight
's
excuse
,
she
say
she
be
sure
he
be
no
gentleman
;
and
when
the
Master
of
the
Ceremonies
offer
to
hand
her
into
the
chair
,
she
rap
him
over
the
knuckle
with
her
fan
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
's
footman
be
still
at
the
door
,
she
and
Chowder
get
into
the
same
vehicle
,
and
be
carry
off
amidst
the
joke
of
the
chairman
and
other
populace
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
ride
out
on
Clerkendown
,
and
happen
to
enter
just
as
the
fracas
be
over
 
<EOS>
the
Baronet
,
come
up
to
me
with
an
affected
air
of
chagrin
recount
the
adventure
;
at
which
I
laugh
heartily
,
and
then
his
countenance
clear
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
soul
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
when
I
see
a
sort
of
a
wild
baist
,
snarl
with
open
mouth
at
the
Master
of
the
Ceremonies
,
like
the
red
cow
go
to
devour
Tom
Thumb
,
I
could
do
no
less
than
go
to
the
assistance
of
the
little
man
;
but
I
never
dreamt
the
baist
<EOS>
be
one
of
Mrs
Bramble
's
attendant
 
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
if
I
have
,
he
may
have
make
his
breakfast
upon
Derrick
and
welcome
 
<EOS>
but
,
you
know
,
my
dear
friend
,
how
natural
it
be
for
us
Irishmen
to
blunder
,
and
to
take
the
wrong
sow
by
the
ear
 
<EOS>
however
I
will
confess
judgment
,
and
cry
her
mercy
;
and
'
tis
to
be
hope
,
a
penitent
sinner
may
be
forgive
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
him
,
that
as
the
offence
be
not
involuntary
of
his
side
,
it
be
to
be
hope
he
would
not
find
her
implacable
.
    
<EOS>
but
in
truth
,
all
this
concern
be
dissemble
.
<EOS>
in
his
approach
of
gallantry
to
Mrs
Tabitha
,
he
have
be
mislead
by
a
mistake
of
at
least
six
thousand
pound
,
in
the
calculation
of
her
fortune
;
and
in
this
particular
he
be
just
undeceived
.
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
seize
the
first
opportunity
of
incur
her
displeasure
decently
,
in
such
a
manner
as
would
certainly
annihilate
the
correspondence
;
and
he
could
not
have
take
a
more
effectual
method
,
than
that
of
beat
her
dog
.
<EOS>
when
he
present
himself
at
our
door
,
to
pay
his
respect
to
the
offend
fair
,
he
be
refuse
admittance
;
and
give
to
understand
,
that
he
should
never
find
her
at
home
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
so
inaccessible
to
Derrick
,
who
come
to
demand
satisfaction
for
the
insult
she
have
offer
to
him
,
even
in
the
verge
of
his
own
court
.
<EOS>
She
know
it
be
convenient
to
be
well
with
the
master
of
the
Ceremonies
,
while
she
continue
to
frequent
the
room
;
and
,
have
hear
he
be
a
poet
,
begin
to
be
afraid
of
make
her
appearance
in
a
ballad
or
lampoon
.
  
<EOS>
She
therefore
make
excuse
for
what
she
have
do
,
impute
it
to
the
flutter
of
her
spirit
;
and
subscribe
handsomely
for
his
poem
:
so
that
he
be
perfectly
appease
,
and
overwhelm
her
with
a
profusion
of
compliment
.
<EOS>
He
even
solicit
a
reconciliation
with
Chowder
;
which
,
however
,
the
latter
decline
;
and
he
declare
,
that
if
he
could
find
a
precedent
in
the
annal
of
the
Bath
,
which
he
would
carefully
examine
for
that
purpose
,
her
favourite
should
be
admit
to
the
next
public
breakfasting
 
<EOS>
but
,
I
believe
she
will
not
expose
herself
or
him
to
the
risque
of
a
second
disgrace
 
who
will
supply
the
place
of
Mackilligut
in
her
affection
,
I
can
not
foresee
;
but
nothing
in
the
shape
of
man
can
come
amiss
.
<EOS>
though
she
be
a
violent
church
-
woman
,
of
the
most
intolerant
zeal
,
I
believe
in
my
conscience
she
would
have
no
objection
,
at
present
,
to
treat
on
the
score
of
matrimony
with
an
Anabaptist
,
Quaker
,
or
Jew
;
and
even
ratify
the
treaty
,
at
the
expence
of
her
own
conversion
.
<EOS>
but
,
perhaps
,
I
think
too
hardly
of
this
kinswoman
;
who
,
I
must
own
,
be
very
little
beholden
to
the
good
opinion
of
    
Yours
,
J
Melford

<EOS>
Bath
,
May
6
.
    
<EOS>
to
Dr
Lewis
.
  
<EOS>
you
ask
me
,
why
I
do
not
take
the
air
a
-
horseback
,
during
this
fine
weather
?
  
<EOS>
in
which
of
the
avenue
of
this
paradise
would
you
have
me
take
that
exercise
?
<EOS>
Shall
I
commit
myself
to
the
highroad
of
London
or
Bristol
,
to
be
stifle
with
dust
,
or
press
to
death
in
the
midst
of
post
-
chaise
,
fly
machine
,
waggon
,
and
coal
horse
;
besides
the
troop
of
fine
gentleman
that
take
to
the
highway
to
shew
their
horsemanship
!
<EOS>
and
the
coach
of
fine
lady
,
who
go
thither
to
shew
their
equipage
?
<EOS>
Shall
I
attempt
the
down
,
and
fatigue
myself
to
death
in
climb
up
an
eternal
ascent
,
without
any
hope
of
reach
the
summit
?
<EOS>
know
<EOS>
then
,
I
have
make
diver
desperate
leap
at
those
upper
region
;
but
always
fall
backward
into
this
vapour
-
pit
,
exhaust
and
dispirit
by
those
ineffectual
effort
;
and
here
we
poor
valetudinatians
pant
and
struggle
,
like
so
many
chinese
gudgeon
,
gasp
in
the
bottom
of
a
punch
bowl
.
<EOS>
by
Heaven
it
be
a
kind
of
inchantment
!
<EOS>
if
I
do
not
speedily
break
the
spell
,
and
escape
,
I
may
chance
to
give
up
the
ghost
in
this
nauseous
stew
of
corruption
 
<EOS>
It
be
but
two
night
ago
,
that
I
have
like
to
have
make
my
public
exit
,
at
a
minute
's
warning
.
<EOS>
one
of
my
great
weakness
be
that
of
suffer
myself
to
be
over
-
rule
by
the
opinion
of
people
,
whose
judgment
I
despise
 
<EOS>
I
own
,
with
shame
and
confusion
of
face
,
that
importunity
of
any
kind
I
can
not
resist
.
<EOS>
this
want
of
courage
and
constancy
be
an
original
flaw
in
my
nature
,
which
you
must
have
often
observe
with
compassion
,
if
not
with
contempt
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
some
of
our
boasted
virtue
may
be
trace
up
to
this
defect
.
     
<EOS>
without
further
preamble
,
I
be
persuade
to
go
to
a
ball
,
on
purpose
to
see
Liddy
dance
a
minuet
with
a
young
petulant
jackanape
,
the
only
son
of
a
wealthy
undertaker
from
London
,
whose
mother
lodge
in
our
neighbourhood
,
and
have
contract
an
acquaintance
with
Tabby
.
<EOS>
I
sit
a
couple
of
long
hour
,
half
stifled
,
in
the
midst
of
a
noysome
crowd
;
and
could
not
help
wonder
,
that
so
many
hundred
of
those
that
rank
as
rational
creature
,
could
find
entertainment
in
see
a
succession
of
insipid
animal
,
describe
the
same
dull
figure
for
a
whole
evening
,
on
an
area
,
not
much
big
than
a
taylor
's
shop
-
board
.
<EOS>
if
there
have
be
any
beauty
,
grace
,
activity
,
magnificent
dress
,
or
variety
of
any
kind
,
howsoever
absurd
,
to
engage
the
attention
,
and
amuse
the
fancy
,
I
should
not
have
be
surprise
;
but
there
be
no
such
object
:
it
be
a
tiresome
repetition
of
the
same
languid
,
frivolous
scene
,
perform
by
actor
that
seem
to
sleep
in
all
their
motion
 
<EOS>
the
continual
swimming
of
those
phantom
before
my
eye
,
give
me
a
swimming
of
the
head
;
which
be
also
affect
by
the
fouled
air
,
circulate
through
such
a
number
of
rotten
human
bellow
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
retreat
towards
the
door
,
and
stand
in
the
passage
to
the
next
room
,
talk
to
my
friend
Quin
;
when
an
end
be
put
to
the
minuet
,
the
bench
be
remove
to
make
way
for
the
country
-
dance
;
and
the
multitude
rise
at
once
,
the
whole
atmosphere
be
put
in
commotion
.
<EOS>
then
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
come
rush
upon
me
,
an
egyptian
gale
,
so
impregnate
with
pestilential
vapour
,
that
my
nerve
be
overpower
,
and
I
dropt
sensess
upon
the
floor
.
    
<EOS>
You
may
easily
conceive
what
a
clamour
and
confusion
this
accident
must
have
produce
,
in
such
an
assembly
 
<EOS>
I
soon
recover
,
however
,
and
find
myself
in
an
easy
chair
,
support
by
my
own
people
 
Sister
Tabby
,
in
her
great
tenderness
,
have
put
me
to
the
torture
,
squeeze
my
head
under
her
arm
,
and
stuff
my
nose
with
spirit
of
hartshorn
,
till
the
whole
inside
be
excoriate
.
<EOS>
I
no
sooner
get
home
,
than
I
send
for
doctor
Ch
#
#
#
#
,
who
assure
me
<EOS>
,
I
need
not
be
alarm
,
for
my
swooning
be
entirely
occasion
by
an
accidental
impression
of
fetid
effluvia
upon
nerve
of
uncommon
sensibility
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
other
people
's
nerve
be
construct
;
but
one
would
imagine
they
must
be
make
of
very
coarse
material
to
stand
the
shock
of
such
a
horrid
assault
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
indeed
,
a
compound
of
villanous
smell
,
in
which
the
most
violent
stink
,
and
the
most
powerful
perfume
,
contend
for
the
mastery
.
<EOS>
imagine
to
yourself
a
high
exalt
essence
of
mingled
odour
,
arise
from
putrid
gum
,
impost
-
humated
lung
,
sour
flatulency
,
rank
arm
-
pit
,
sweat
foot
,
run
sore
and
issue
;
plaster
,
ointment
,
and
embrocation
,
hungary
-
water
,
spirit
of
lavander
,
assasoetida
drop
,
musk
,
hartshorn
,
and
sal
volatile
;
besides
a
thousand
frowzy
steam
,
which
I
could
not
analyse
.
<EOS>
such
,
o
Dick
!
<EOS>
be
the
fragrant
<EOS>
aether
we
breathe
in
the
polite
assembly
of
Bath
 
<EOS>
such
be
the
atmosphere
I
have
exchange
for
the
pure
,
elastic
,
animate
air
of
the
Welsh
mountain
 
<EOS>
o
Rus
,
quando
te
aspiciam
!
  
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
the
devil
possess
me
     
<EOS>
but
few
word
be
good
:
I
have
take
my
resolution
  
<EOS>
You
may
well
suppose
I
do
not
intend
to
entertain
the
company
with
a
second
exhibition
 
I
have
promise
,
in
an
evil
hour
,
to
proceed
to
London
,
and
that
promise
shall
be
perform
;
but
my
stay
in
the
metropolis
shall
be
brief
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
for
the
benefit
of
my
health
,
project
an
expedition
to
the
North
,
which
,
I
hope
,
will
afford
some
agreable
pastime
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
travel
farther
that
way
than
Scarborough
;
and
,
I
think
it
be
a
reproach
upon
me
,
as
a
british
freeholder
,
to
have
live
so
long
without
make
an
excursion
to
the
other
side
of
the
Tweed
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
have
some
relation
settle
in
Yorkshire
,
to
whom
it
may
not
be
improper
to
introduce
my
nephew
and
his
sister
  
<EOS>
at
present
,
I
have
nothing
to
add
,
but
that
Tabby
be
happily
disentangle
from
the
irish
Baronet
;
and
that
I
will
not
fail
to
make
you
acquaint
,
from
time
to
time

DEAR
PHILIPS
,
a
FEW
day
ago
we
be
terribly
alarm
by
my
uncle
's
fainting
at
the
ball
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
ever
since
curse
his
own
folly
,
for
go
thither
at
the
request
of
an
impertinent
woman
.
<EOS>
He
declare
,
he
will
sooner
visit
a
house
infect
with
the
plague
,
than
trust
himself
in
such
a
nauseous
spital
for
the
future
,
for
he
swear
the
accident
be
occasion
by
the
stench
of
the
crowd
;
and
that
he
would
never
desire
a
strong
proof
of
our
be
make
of
very
gross
material
,
than
our
have
withstand
the
annoyance
,
by
which
he
be
so
much
discompose
.
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
be
very
thankful
for
the
coarseness
of
my
organ
,
be
in
no
danger
of
ever
fall
a
sacrifice
to
the
delicacy
of
my
nose
.
<EOS>
Mr
Bramble
be
extravagantly
delicate
in
all
his
sensation
,
both
of
soul
and
body
.
<EOS>
I
be
infome
by
Dr
Lewis
,
that
he
once
fight
a
duel
with
an
officer
of
the
horse
guard
,
for
turn
aside
to
the
Park
wall
,
on
a
necessary
occasion
,
when
he
be
pass
with
a
lady
under
his
protection
.
<EOS>
His
blood
rise
at
every
instance
of
insolence
and
cruelty
,
even
where
he
himself
be
no
way
concerned
;
and
ingratitude
make
his
tooth
chatter
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
the
recital
of
a
generous
,
humane
,
or
grateful
action
,
never
fail
to
draw
from
him
tear
of
approbation
,
which
he
be
often
greatly
distressed
o
conceal
.
    
<EOS>
yesterday
one
Paunceford
give
tea
,
on
particular
invitation
 
<EOS>
this
man
,
after
have
be
long
buffet
by
adversity
,
go
abroad
;
and
Fortune
,
resolve
to
make
him
amend
for
her
former
coyness
,
set
him
all
at
once
up
to
the
very
ear
in
affluence
.
<EOS>
He
have
now
emerge
from
obscurity
,
and
blaze
out
in
all
the
tinsel
of
the
time
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
find
that
he
be
charge
with
any
practice
that
the
law
deem
dishonest
,
or
that
his
wealth
have
make
him
arrogant
and
inaccessible
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
take
great
pain
to
appear
affable
and
gracious
.
<EOS>
but
they
say
,
he
be
remarkable
for
shrink
from
his
former
friendship
,
which
be
generally
too
plain
and
homespun
to
appear
amidst
his
present
brilliant
connexion
;
and
that
he
seem
uneasy
at
the
sight
of
some
old
benefactor
,
whom
a
man
of
honour
would
take
pleasure
to
acknowledge
 
<EOS>
be
that
as
it
may
,
he
have
so
effectually
engage
the
company
at
Bath
,
that
when
I
go
with
my
uncle
to
the
coffee
-
house
in
the
evening
,
there
be
not
a
soul
in
the
room
but
one
person
,
seemingly
in
year
,
who
sit
by
the
fire
,
read
one
of
the
paper
.
<EOS>
Mr
Bramble
,
take
his
station
close
by
him
,
"
there
be
such
a
crowd
and
confusion
of
chair
in
the
passage
to
Simpson
's
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
that
we
could
hardly
get
along
 
<EOS>
I
wish
those
minion
of
fortune
would
fall
upon
more
laudable
way
of
spend
their
money
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
Sir
,
you
like
this
kind
of
entertainment
as
little
as
I
do
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
,
I
have
any
great
relish
for
such
entertainment
,
"
answer
the
other
,
without
take
his
eye
off
the
paper
  
"
Mr
Serle
,
(
resume
my
uncle
)
<EOS>
I
beg
pardon
for
interrupt
you
;
but
I
can
not
resist
the
curiosity
I
have
to
know
if
you
receive
a
card
on
this
occasion
?
"
    
<EOS>
the
man
seem
surprised
at
this
address
,
and
make
some
pause
as
doubtful
what
answer
he
should
make
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
my
curiosity
be
impertinent
,
add
my
uncle
,
but
I
have
a
particular
reason
for
ask
the
favour
.
"
<EOS>
"
if
that
be
the
case
,
(
reply
Mr
Serle
)
<EOS>
I
shall
gratify
you
without
hesitation
,
by
own
,
that
I
have
have
no
card
.
<EOS>
but
,
give
me
leave
,
Sir
,
to
ask
in
my
turn
,
what
reason
you
think
I
have
to
expect
such
an
invitation
from
the
gentleman
who
give
tea
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
have
my
own
reason
;
(
cry
Mr
Bramble
,
with
some
emotion
)
and
be
convince
more
than
ever
,
that
this
Paunceford
be
a
contemptible
fellow
.
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
(
say
the
other
,
lay
down
the
paper
)
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
honour
to
know
you
,
but
your
discourse
be
a
little
mysterious
,
and
seem
to
require
some
explanation
.
<EOS>
the
person
you
be
pleased
to
treat
so
cavalierly
,
be
a
gentleman
of
some
consequence
in
the
community
;
and
,
for
aught
you
know
,
I
may
also
have
my
particular
reason
for
defend
his
character
 
"
"
if
I
be
not
convince
of
the
contrary
,
(
observe
the
other
)
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
go
so
far
 
"
"
let
me
tell
you
,
Sir
,
<EOS>
(
say
the
stranger
,
raise
his
voice
)
<EOS>
you
have
go
too
far
,
in
hazard
such
reflection
 
"
    
<EOS>
here
he
be
interrupt
by
my
uncle
;
who
ask
peevishly
,
if
he
be
Don
Quixote
enough
,
at
this
time
of
day
,
to
throw
down
his
gauntler
as
champion
for
a
man
who
have
treat
him
with
such
ungrateful
neglect
.
<EOS>
"
for
my
part
,
(
add
he
)
<EOS>
I
shall
never
quarrel
with
you
again
upon
this
subject
;
and
what
I
have
say
now
,
have
be
suggest
as
much
by
my
regard
for
you
,
as
by
my
contempt
of
him
 
"
Mr
Serle
,
then
pull
off
his
spectacle
,
eye
my
uncle
very
earnestly
,
say
,
in
a
mitigate
tone
,
"
surely
I
be
much
oblige
 
<EOS>
ah
,
Mr
Bramble
!
<EOS>
I
now
recollect
your
feature
,
though
I
have
not
see
you
these
many
year
.
"
<EOS>
"
We
may
have
be
less
stranger
to
one
another
,
(
answer
the
"
squire
)
if
our
corespondence
have
not
be
interrupt
,
in
consequence
of
a
misunderstanding
,
occasion
by
this
very
 
,
but
no
matter
  
Mr
Serle
,
I
esteem
your
character
;
and
my
friendship
,
such
as
it
be
,
you
may
freely
command
.
"
<EOS>
"
the
offer
be
too
agreeable
to
be
decline
(
say
he
)
;
I
embrace
it
very
cordially
;
and
,
as
the
first
fruit
of
it
,
request
that
you
will
change
this
subject
,
which
,
with
me
,
be
a
matter
of
peculiar
delicacy
.
"
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
own
he
be
in
the
right
,
and
the
discourse
take
a
more
general
turn
.
<EOS>
Mr
Serle
pass
the
evening
with
us
at
our
lodging
;
and
appear
to
be
intelligent
,
and
even
entertaining
;
but
his
disposition
be
rather
of
a
melancholy
hue
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
say
he
be
a
man
of
uncommon
part
,
and
unquestioned
probity
:
that
his
fortune
,
which
be
originally
small
,
have
be
greatly
hurt
by
a
romantic
spirit
of
generosity
,
which
he
have
often
display
,
even
at
the
expence
of
his
discretion
,
in
favour
of
worthless
individual
 
that
he
have
rescue
Paunceford
from
the
low
distress
,
when
he
be
bankrupt
,
both
in
mean
and
reputation
  
that
he
have
espouse
his
interest
with
a
degree
of
enthusiasm
,
break
,
with
several
friend
and
even
draw
his
sword
against
my
uncle
,
who
have
particular
reason
for
question
the
moral
character
of
the
say
Paunceford
:
that
,
without
Serle
's
countenance
and
assistance
,
the
other
never
could
have
embrace
the
opportunity
,
which
have
raise
him
to
this
pinnacle
of
wealth
:
that
Paunceford
,
in
the
first
transport
of
his
success
,
have
write
,
from
abroad
,
letter
to
different
correspondent
,
own
his
obligation
to
Mr
Serle
,
in
the
warm
term
of
acknowledgment
,
and
declare
he
consider
himself
only
as
a
factor
for
the
occasion
of
his
good
friend
:
that
,
without
doubt
,
he
have
make
declaration
of
the
same
nature
to
his
benefactor
himself
,
though
this
last
be
always
silent
and
reserve
on
the
subject
;
but
for
some
year
,
those
trope
and
figure
of
rhetoric
have
be
disuse
:
that
upon
his
return
to
England
,
he
have
be
lavish
in
his
caress
to
Mr
Serle
,
invite
him
to
his
house
,
and
press
him
to
make
it
his
own
:
that
he
have
overwhelm
him
with
general
profession
,
and
affect
to
express
the
warm
regard
for
him
,
in
company
of
their
common
acquaintance
;
so
that
every
body
believe
his
gratitude
be
as
liberal
as
his
fortune
;
and
some
go
so
far
as
to
congratulate
Mr
Serle
on
both
.
    
<EOS>
all
this
time
Paunceford
carefully
and
artfully
avoid
particular
discussion
with
his
old
patron
,
who
have
too
much
spirit
to
drop
the
most
distant
hint
of
balance
the
account
of
obligation
:
that
,
nevertheless
,
a
man
of
his
feeling
could
not
but
resent
this
shocking
return
for
all
his
kindness
;
and
,
therefore
,
he
withdraw
himself
from
the
connexion
,
without
come
to
the
least
explanation
,
or
speak
a
syllable
on
the
subject
to
any
live
soul
;
so
that
now
their
correspondence
be
reduce
to
a
slight
salute
with
the
hat
,
when
they
chance
to
meet
in
any
public
place
;
an
accident
that
rarely
happen
,
for
their
walk
lie
different

I

<EOS>
I

circumscribed
to

for

with
new
object

some

I
shall
therefore
conclude
my

for
your

and
though

in
all
appearance

it
will
not
treat
of
very
important
or
interesting
particular
,
it
may
prove
,
perhaps
,
not
altogether
uninstructive
and
unentertaining

<EOS>
the
musick

and
entertainment
of
Bath
be
over
for
this

all
our

a

winded
parson
,
waddle
like
so
many
crow
long
the
North
Parade
.
<EOS>
there
be
always
a
great
shew
of
the
clergy
at
Bath
;
none
of
your
thin
,
puny
,
yellow
hectic
figure
,
exhaust
with
abstinence
and
hard
study
,
labour
under
the

but
great
over

grow
dignitary
and
rector
,
with
rubicund
nose
and
gouty
ancle
,
or
broad
bloated
face
,
drag
along
great

belly
;
the
emblem
of
sloth
and
indigestion
     
now
we
be
upon
the
subject
of
parson
,
I
must
tell
you
a
ludicrous
adventure
,
which
be
atchieve
the
other
day
by
Tom
Fastgate
,
whom
you
may
remember
on
the
foundation
of
Queen
's
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
very
assiduous
to
pin
himself
upon
George
Prankley
,
who
be
a
gentleman
-
commoner
of
Christ
-
church
,
know
the
say
<EOS>
Prankley
be
heir
to
a
considerable
estate
,
and
would
have
the
advowson
of
a
good
living
,
the
incumbent
of
which
be
very
old
and
infirm
.
<EOS>
He
study
his
passion
and
flatter
them
so
effectually
,
as
to
become
his
companion
and
counsellor
;
and
at
last
,
obtain
of
him
a
promise
of
the
presentation
,
when
the
living
should
fall
.
<EOS>
Prankley
,
on
his
uncle
's
death
,
quit
Oxford
,
and
make
his
first
appearance
in
the
fashionable
world
at
London
;
from
whence
he
come
lately
to
Bath
,
where
he
have
be
exhibit
himself
among
the
buck
and
gamester
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
Eastgate
follow
him
hither
;
but
he
should
not
have
quit
him
for
a
moment
,
at
his
first
emerge
into
life
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
have
know
he
be
a
fantastic
,
foolish
,
fickle
fellow
,
who
would
forget
his
college
-
attachment
the
moment
,
they
cease
appeal
to
his
sense
.
<EOS>
Tom
meet
with
a
cold
reception
from
his
old
friend
;
and
be
,
moreover
,
inform
,
that
he
have
promise
the
living
to
another
man
,
who
have
a
vote
in
the
county
,
where
be
propose
to
offer
himself
a
candidate
at
the
next
general
election
.
<EOS>
He
now
remember
nothing
of
Eastgate
,
but
the
freedom
he
have
use
to
take
with
him
,
while
Tom
have
quietly
stand
his
butt
,
with
an
eye
to
the
benefice
;
and
those
freedom
he
begin
to
repeat
in
common
place
sarcasm
on
his
person
and
his
cloth
,
which
he
utter
in
the
public
coffee
-
house
,
for
the
entertainment
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
egregiously
mistake
in
give
his
own
wit
credit
for
that
tameness
of
Eastgate
,
which
have
be
entirely
owe
to
prudential
consideration
.
<EOS>
these
be
now
remove
,
he
retort
his
repartee
with
interest
,
and
find
no
great
difficulty
in
turn
the
laugh
upon
the
aggressor
;
who
,
lose
his
temper
,
call
him
name
,
and
ask
,
if
he
know
whom
he
talk
to
?
<EOS>
after
much
altercation
,
Prankley
shake
his
cane
,
bid
him
hold
his
tongue
,
otherwise
he
would
dust
his
cassock
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
pretension
to
such
a
valet
(
say
Tom
)
;
but
if
you
should
do
me
that
office
,
and
overheat
yourself
,
I
have
here
a
good
oaken
towel
at
your
service
.
"
    
<EOS>
Prankley
be
equally
incensed
and
confound
at
this
reply
.
<EOS>
after
moment
's
pause
,
he
take
him
aside
towards
the
window
;
and
,
point
to
the
clump
of
fir
on
Clerken
-
down
,
ask
in
a
whisper
,
if
he
have
spirit
enough
to
meet
him
there
,
with
a
case
of
pistol
,
at
six
o'clock
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
Eastgate
answer
in
the
affirmative
;
and
,
with
a
steady
countenance
,
assure
him
,
he
would
not
fail
to
give
him
the
rendezvous
at
the
hour
he
mention
.
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
retire
;
and
the
challenger
stay
some
time
in
manif
agitation
.
<EOS>
in
the
morning
Eastgate
,
who
know
his
man
,
and
have
take
his
resolution
,
go
to
Prankley
's
lodging
,
and
rouse
him
by
five
o'clock
     
<EOS>
the
"
squire
,
in
all
probability
,
curse
his
punctuality
in
his
heart
,
but
he
affect
to
talk
big
;
and
have
prepare
his
artillery
over
-
night
,
they
cross
the
water
at
the
end
of
the
South
Parade
.
<EOS>
in
their
progress
up
the
hill
,
Prankley
often
eye
the
parson
,
in
hope
of
perceive
some
reluctance
in
his
countenance
;
but
as
no
such
mark
appear
he
attempt
to
intimidate
him
by
word
of
mouth
,
"
if
these
flint
do
their
office
(
say
he
)
,
I
will
do
thy
business
in
a
few
minute
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
desire
you
will
do
your
good
(
reply
the
other
)
;
for
my
part
,
I
come
not
here
to
trifle
.
<EOS>
Our
life
be
in
the
hand
of
God
;
and
one
of
us
already
totter
on
the
brink
of
eternity
 
<EOS>
"
this
remark
seem
to
make
some
impression
upon
the
"
squire
,
who
change
countenance
,
and
with
a
faultering
accent
observe
,
"
that
it
ill
become
a
clergyman
to
be
concern
in
quarrel
and
blood
-
shed
 
"
"
Your
insolence
to
me
(
say
Eastgate
)
<EOS>
I
should
have
bear
with
patience
,
have
not
you
cast
the
most
infamous
reflection
upon
my
order
,
the
honour
of
which
I
think
myself
in
duty
bind
to
maintain
,
even
at
the
expence
of
my
heart
's
blood
;
and
surely
it
can
be
no
crime
to
put
out
of
the
world
a
profligate
wretch
,
without
any
sense
of
principle
,
morality
,
or
religion
 
<EOS>
"
"
Thou
may'st
take
away
my
life
,
(
cry
Prankley
,
in
great
perturbation
)
but
do
not
go
to
murder
my
character
.
  
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
has't
get
no
conscience
?
"
<EOS>
"
My
conscience
be
perfectly
quiet
(
reply
the
other
)
;
and
now
,
sir
,
we
be
upon
the
spot
 
take
your
ground
as
near
as
you
please
;
prime
your
pistol
;
and
the
Lord
,
of
his
infinite
mercy
,
have
compassion
upon
your
miserable
soul
!
"
    
<EOS>
this
ejaculation
he
pronounce
in
a
loud
solemn
tone
,
with
his
hat
off
<EOS>
and
his
eye
lift
up
;
then
draw
a
large
horse
-
pistol
,
he
present
,
and
put
himself
in
a
posture
of
action
.
<EOS>
Prankley
take
his
distance
,
and
endeavour
to
prime
,
but
his
hand
shake
with
such
violence
,
that
he
find
this
operation
impracticable
 
<EOS>
His
antagonist
,
see
how
it
be
with
him
,
offer
his
assistance
,
and
advance
for
the
purpose
;
when
the
poor
"
squire
,
exceedingly
alarm
at
what
he
have
hear
and
see
,
desire
the
action
may
be
defer
till
next
day
,
as
he
have
not
settle
his
affair
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
ha'nt
make
my
will
(
say
he
)
;
my
sister
be
not
provide
for
;
and
I
just
now
recollect
and
old
promise
,
which
my
conscience
tell
me
I
ought
to
perform
 
I
will
first
convince
thee
,
<EOS>
that
I
be
not
a
wretch
without
principle
,
and
then
thou
shalt
have
an
opportunity
to
take
my
life
,
which
thou
seem'st
to
thirst
after
so
eagerly
 
<EOS>
"
    
Eastgate
understand
the
hint
;
and
tell
him
,
that
one
day
should
break
no
square
;
add
,
"
God
forbid
that
I
should
be
the
mean
of
hinder
you
from
act
the
part
of
an
honest
man
,
and
a
dutiful
brother
 
<EOS>
"
by
virtue
of
this
cessation
they
return
peaceably
together
.
<EOS>
prankley
forthwith
make
out
the
presentation
of
the
living
,
and
deliver
it
to
eastgate
,
tell
him
,
at
the
same
time
,
he
have
now
settle
his
affair
,
and
be
ready
to
attend
him
to
the
Firgrove
;
but
Tom
declare
he
could
not
think
of
lift
his
hand
against
the
life
of
so
great
a
benefactor
 
<EOS>
He
do
more
:
when
they
next
meet
at
the
coffee

house
,
he
ask
pardon
of
Mr
Prankley
,
if
in
his
passion
he
have
say
any
thing
to
give
him
offence
;
and
the
"
squire
be
so
gracious
as
to
forgive
him
with
a
cordial
shake
of
the
hand
,
declare
that
he
do
not
like
to
be
a
variance
with
an
old
college

companion
 
<EOS>
next
day
,
however
,
he
leave
Bath
abruptly
;
and
then
Eastgate
tell
me
all
these
particular
,
not
a

pleased
with
the

Bath

<EOS>
to
Dr

<EOS>
dear
DICK
,
I
shall
to
-
morrow
set
out
for
London
,
where
I
have
bespoke
lodging
,
at
Mr
Norton
's
Golden
-
square
.
<EOS>
although
I
be
no
admirer
of
Bath
,
I
shall
leave
it
with
regret
;
because
I
must
part
with
some
old
friend
,
whom
,
in
all
probability
,
I
shall
never
see
again
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
coffee
-
house
conversation
,
I
have
often
hear
very
extraordinary
encomium
pass
on
the
performance
of
Mr
T
#
#
#
#
a
gentleman
reside
in
this
place
,
who
paint
landscape
for
his
amusement
.
<EOS>
as
I
have
no
great
confidence
in
the
taste
and
judgment
of
coffee
-
house
connoisseur
,
and
never
receive
much
pleasure
from
this
branch
of
the
art
,
those
general
praise
make
no
impression
at
all
on
my
curiosity
;
but
at
the
request
of
a
particular
friend
,
I
go
yesterday
to
see
the
piece
,
which
have
be
so
warmly
commend
  
I
must
own
I
be
no
judge
of
painting
,
though
very
fond
of
picture
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
imagine
that
my
sense
would
play
me
so
false
,
as
to
betray
me
into
admiration
of
any
thing
that
be
very
bad
;
but
,
true
it
be
,
I
have
often
overlook
capital
beauty
,
in
piece
of
extraordinary
merit
 
<EOS>
if
I
be
not
totally
devoid
of
taste
,
however
,
this
young
gentleman
of
Bath
be
the
good
landscape
painter
now
live
:
I
be
strike
with
his
performance
in
such
a
manner
,
as
I
have
never
be
by
paint
before
.
<EOS>
His
tree
not
only
have
a
richness
of
foilage
and
warmth
of
colouring
,
which
delight
the
view
;
but
also
a
certain
magnificence
in
the
disposition
,
and
spirit
in
the
expression
,
which
I
can
not
describe
.
<EOS>
His
management
of
the
chiaro
obscuro
,
or
light
and
shadow
,
especially
gleam
of
sun
-
shine
,
be
altogether
wonderful
,
both
in
the
contrivance
and
execution
;
and
he
be
so
happy
in
his
perspective
,
and
mark
his
distance
at
sea
,
by
a
progressive
series
of
ship
,
vessel
,
cape
,
and
promontory
,
that
I
could
not
help
think
,
I
have
a
distant
view
of
thirty
league
upon
the
back
-
ground
of
the
picture
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
any
taste
for
ingenuity
leave
in
degenerate
age
,
fast
think
into
barbarism
,
this
artist
,
I
apprehend
,
will
make
a
capital
figure
,
as
soon
as
his
work
be
know
     
two
day
ago
,
I
be
favour
with
a
visit
by
Mr
Fitz

owen
;
who
,
with
great
formality
,
solicit
my
vote
and
interest
at
the
general
election
.
<EOS>
I
ought
not
to
have
be
shock
at
the
confidence
of
this
man
;
though
it
be
remarkable
,
consider
what
have
pass
between
him
and
me
on
a
former
occasion
 
<EOS>
these
visit
be
mere
matter
of
form
,
which
a
candidate
make
to
every
elector
;
even
to
those
who
,
he
know
,
be
engage
in
the
interest
of
his
competitor
,
lest
he
should
expose
himself
to
the
imputation
of
pride
,
at
a
time
when
it
be
expect
he
should
appear
humble
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
know
nothing
so
object
as
the
behaviour
of
a
man
canvass
for
a
seat
in
a
parliament
 
<EOS>
this
mean
prostration
,
(
to
borough
-
elector
,
especially
)
have
,
I
imagine
,
contribute
in
a
great
measure
to
raise
that
spirit
of
insolence
among
the
vulgar
;
which
,
like
the
devil
,
will
be
find
very
difficult
to
lay
.
<EOS>
be
that
<EOS>
as
it
may
,
I
be
in
some
confusion
at
the
effrontery
of
Fitz

owen
;
but
I
soon
recollect
myself
,
and
tell
him
,
I
have
not
yet
determine
for
when
I
should
give
my
vote
,
not
whether
I
should
give
it
for
any
.
  
<EOS>
the
truth
,
be
I
look
upon
both
candidate
in
the
same
light
;
and
should
think
myself
a
traitor
to
the
constitution
of
my
country
,
if
I
vote
for
either
.
<EOS>
if
every
elector
would
bring
the
same
consideration
home
to
his
conscience
,
we
should
not
have
such
reason
to
exclaim
against
the
venality
of
p####ts
.
<EOS>
but
we
be
all
a
pack
of
venal
and
corrupt
rascal
;
so
lost
to
all
sense
of
honestly
,
and
all
tenderness
of
character
,
that
,
in
a
little
time
,
I
be
fully
persuade
,
nothing
will
be
infamous
but
virtue
and
public

spirit

Winifred
Jenkins

whose
province
it
be
to
support
Chowder

a
cushion
in

<EOS>
I
could
scarce
refrain
from
laugh
,
when
I
look
into
the
vehicle
,
and
see
that
animal
sit
opposite
to
my
uncle
,
like
any
other
passenger
.
<EOS>
the
"
squire
,
ashamed
of
his
situation
,
blush
to
the
eye
:
and
,
call
to
the
postillion
to
drive
on
,
pull
the
glass
up
in
my
face
.
<EOS>
I
,
and
his
servant
John
Thomas
,
attend
them
on
horseback
.
    
<EOS>
nothing
worth
mention
occur
,
till
we
arrive
on
the
edge
of
Marlborough
Downs
.
<EOS>
there
one
of
the
four
horse
fall
,
in
go
down
hill
at
a
round
trot
;
and
the
postillion
behind
,
endeavour
to
stop
the
carriage
,
pull
it
on
one
side
into
a
deep
rut
,
where
it
be
fairly
overturn
.
<EOS>
I
have
ride
on
about
two
hundred
yard
before
;
but
,
hear
a
loud
scream
,
gallop
back
and
dismount
,
to
give
what
assistance
be
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
when
I
look
into
the
coach
,
I
could
see
nothing
distinctly
,
but
the
nether
end
of
Jenkins
,
who
be
kick
her
heel
and
squall
with
great
vociferation
.
<EOS>
all
on
a
sudden
,
my
uncle
thrust
up
his
bar
pate
,
and
bolt
through
the
window
,
as
nimble
as
a
grashopper
,
have
make
use
of
poor
Win

posterior
as
a
step
in
rise
in
his
ascent

<EOS>
the
man
(
who
have
likewise
quit
his
horse
)
drag
this
forlorn
damsel
,
more
dead
than
alive
,
through
the
same
opening
.
<EOS>
then
Mr
Bramble
,
pull
the
door
off
its
hinge
with
a
jerk
,
lay
hold
on
Liddy
's
arm
,
and
bring
her
to
the
light
;
very
much
frighted
,
but
little
hurt
.
<EOS>
It
fall
to
my
share
to
deliver
our
aunt
Tabitha

who
have
lose
her
cap
in
the
struggle

be
rather
more

half
frantic

with
rage

be
no
bad
representation

She
express
no

and
work
with
the
most
astonishing
agility
,
in
help
to
disentangle
the
horse
from
the

she
cry

in
a
tone
of
distraction

after
have

my

in

retreat
under

from
thence
the

draw
him
by
the

for

office
he
bite
his

to

<EOS>
the

Her

Our

to
the
wound
in

have
overturn

after
much
dispute

resign
his

to
a
shabby
country
fellow

who
undertake
to
go
as
far
as
Marlborough
,
where
they
could
be
better
provide
;

at
that
place
we
arrive
about
one
o'clock

without

impediment

Mrs

find
new

indeed

she
have
a
particular
genius

extract
at

from
almost
every

<EOS>
We
have
scarce
enter
the
room
at
Marlborough

where
we
stay
to
dine
,
when
she
exhibit
a
formal
complaint
against
the
poor
fellow
who
have
supersede
the
postillion

<EOS>
She
say
,
he
be
such
a
beggarly
rascal

that
he
have
ne'er
a
shirt
to
his
back
;
and
have
the
impudence
to
shock
her
sight
by
shew
his
bare
posterior
,
for
which
act
of
indelicacy
he
deserve
to
be
set
in

stock

<EOS>
Mrs
Winifred
Jenkins
confirm
the
assertion

with
respect

his
nakedness

observe
,
at

that
he

a
skin
as
fair
as
alabaster

<EOS>
"
this

hear
what

in
his
own
vindication

"
He
be
accordingly
summon
and
make
his
appearance
,
which
be
equally
queer

pathetic

twenty
year

with
bandy
leg

could
hardly
conceal
what
decency
require

<EOS>
Mrs

turn
from
him

,
she
have
never

such
a
filthy
tatterdemalion

bid
him
begone

observe
,
that

fill
the

full
of
vermin
 
<EOS>
Her
brother
dart
a
significant
glance
at
her
,
as
she
retire
with
Liddy
into
another
apartment

then
ask
the
man
if
he
be
know

any
person
in
Marlborough

<EOS>
when
he
answer
,
that
the

mine

interrogate

declare
that
the

You
perceive
(

to
me

<EOS>
our
landlord

a
Christian

shall
presume
to
censure
the
moral
of

publican

<EOS>
Hark
ye

you

notorious

You
stand

convict

<EOS>
but
,
as
it
do
not
belong

I
will
only
take
upon
me
the
task
of
give
you
a
word
of
advice
 
get
a

with
all
convenient
dispatch
,
that
your
nakedness
may
not
henceforward
give
offence
to
travel
gentlewoman
,
especially
maiden
in

"
    
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
put
a
guinea
in
the
hand
of
the
poor
fellow
,
who
stand
stare
at
him
in
silence
,
with
his
mouth
wide
open
,
till
the
landlord
push
him
out
of
the
room
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
,
as
our
aunt
stept
into
the
coach
,
she
observe
,
with
some
mark
of
satisfaction
,
that
the
postillion
,
who
ride
next
to
her
,
be
not
a
shabby
wretch
like
the
ragamuffin
who
have
drive
them
to
Marlborough
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
difference
be
very
conspicuous
:
this
be
a
smart
fellow
,
with
a
narrow
brim
hat
,
with
gold
cording
,
a
cut
bob
,
a
decent
blue
jacket
,
leather
breech
,
and
a
clean
linen
shirt
,
pusse
above
the
waist
-
band
.
<EOS>
when
we
arrive
at
the
castle
on
Spin
-
hill
,
where
we
lay
,
this
new
postillion
be
remarkably
assiduous
,
in
bring
in
the
loose
parcel
;
and
,
at
length
,
display
the
individual
countenance
of
Humphry
Clinker
,
who
have
metamorphose
himself
in
this
manner
,
by
relieve
from
pawn
part
of
his
own
cloath
,
with
the
money
he
have
receive
from
Mr
Bramble
.
    
<EOS>
Howsoever
please
the
rest
of
the
company
be
with
such
a
favourable
change
in
the
appearance
of
this
poor
creature
,
it
sour
on
the
stomach
of
Mrs
Tabby
,
who
have
not
yet
digest
the
affront
of
his
naked
skin
 
<EOS>
She
toss
her
nose
in
disdain
,
say
,
she
suppose
her
brother
have
take
him
into
favour
,
because
he
have
insult
her
with
his
obscenity
;
that
a
fool
and
his
money
be
soon
part
:
but
that
if
Matt
.
<EOS>
intend
to
take
the
fellow
with
him
to
London
,
she
would
not
go
a
foot
further
that
way
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
say
nothing
with
his
tongue
,
though
his
look
be
sufficiently
expressive
;
and
next
morning
Clinker
-
do
not
appear
,
so
that
we
proceed
without
further
alteration
to
salt
-
hill
,
where
we
propose
to
dine
 
there
,
the
first
person
that
come
to
the
side
of
the
coach
,
and
begin
to
adjust
the
footboard
,
be
no
other
than
Humphry
Clinker
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
hand
out
Mrs
Bramble
,
she
eye
him
with
a
furious
look
,
and
pass
into
the
house
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
be
embarrassed
,
and
ask
him
peevishly
what
have
bring
him
hither
?
<EOS>
the
fellow
say
,
his
honour
have
be
so
good
to
him
,
that
he
have
not
the
heart
to
part
with
him
;
that
he
would
follow
him
to
the
world
's
end
,
and
serve
him
all
the
day
of
his
life
without
fee
or
reward
     
Mr
Bramble
do
not
know
whether
to
chide
or
laugh
at
this
declaration
 
<EOS>
He
foresee
much
contradiction
on
the
side
of
Tabby
;
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
he
could
not
but
be
pleased
with
the
gratitude
of
Clinker
,
as
well
as
with
the
simplicity
of
his
character
 
<EOS>
"
suppose
I
be
inclined
to
take
you
into
my
service

address

this
compliment
and
humiliation
have
some
effect
upon
Tabby
;
but
she
make
no
reply
;
and
Clinker

take
silence
for
consent

give
his
attendance
at
dinner

the
fellow
's
natural
awkwardness

yourself

chatter

if
state
fairly

(
say
he

raise
his
voice

<EOS>
the
question
be
,
whether
I
have
spirit
to
shake
off
an
intollerable
yoke

by
one
effort
of
resolution
,
or
meanness
enough

I

she
could
ask

nothing

his
appearance
in
a
new
suit
of
livery
;
but
as
he
be
little
acquaint
with
London
,
we
have
take
an
occasional
valet
,
whom
I
intend
hereafter
to
hire
as
my
own
servant
.
<EOS>
We
lodge
in
Golden
-
square
,
at
the
house
of
one
Mrs
Norton
,
a
decent
sort
of
a
woman
,
who
take
great
pain
to
make
us
all
easy
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
propose
to
make
a
circuit
of
all
the
remarkable
scene
of
this
metropolis
,
for
the
entertainment
of
his
pupil
;
but
as
both
you
and
I
be
already
acquaint
with
most
of
those
he
will
visit
,
and
with
some
other
he
little
dream
of
,
I
shall
only
communicate
what
will
be
in
some
measure
new
to
your
observation
.
<EOS>
remember
me
to
our
jesuitical
friend
,
and
believe
me
ever

Dear

<EOS>
DEAR
DOCTOR
,
LONDON
be
literally
new
to
me
;
new
in
its
street
,
house
,
and
even
in
its
situation
;
as
the
Irishman
say
,
"
London
be
now
go
out
of
town
.
<EOS>
"
what
I
leave
open
field
,
produce
hay
and
corn
,
I
now
find
cover
with
street
,
and
square
,
and
palace
,
and
church
.
<EOS>
I
be
credibly
inform
that
in
the
space
of
seven
year
,
eleven
thousand
new
house
have
be
build
in
one
quarter
of
Westminster
,
exclusive
of
what
be
daily
add
to
other
part
of
this
unweildy
metropolis
.
<EOS>
Pimlico
and
Knightsbridge
be
now
almost
join
to
Chelsea
and
Kensington
;
and
if
this
infatuation
continue
for
half
a
century
,
I
suppose
the
whole
county
of
Middlesex
will
be
cover
with
brick
.
    
<EOS>
It
must
be
allow
,
indeed
for
the
credit
of
the
present
age
,
that
London
and
Westminster
be
much
better
pave
and
light
than
they
be
formerly
.
<EOS>
the
new
street
be
spacious
,
regular
and
airy
;
and
the
house
generally
convenient
.
<EOS>
the
bridge
at
Blackfriars
be
a
noble
monument
of
taste
and
public
spirit
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
they
stumble
upon
a
work
of
such
magnificence
and
utility
.
<EOS>
but
,
notwithstanding
these
improvement
,
the
capital
be
become
an
overgrown
monster
;
which
,
like
a
dropsical
head
,
will
in
time
leave
the
body
and
extremity
without
nourishment
and
support
.
<EOS>
the
absurdity
will
appear
in
its
full
force
,
when
we
consider
,
that
one
sixth
part
of
the
native
of
this
whole
extensive
kingdom
,
be
crowd
within
the
bill
of
Mortality
.
<EOS>
what
wonder
that
our
village
be
depopulate
,
and
our
farm
in
want
of
day
-
labourer
?
<EOS>
the
abolition
of
small
farm
,
be
but
one
cause
of
the
decrease
of
population
.
<EOS>
indeed
the
incredible
increase
of
horse
and
black
cattle
,
to
answer
the
purpose
of
luxury
,
require
a
prodigious
quantity
of
hay
and
grass
,
which
be
raise
and
manage
without
much
labour
;
but
a
number
of
hand
will
always
be
want
for
the
different
branch
of
agriculture
,
whether
the
farm
be
large
or
small
.
<EOS>
the
tide
of
luxury
have
sweep
all
the
inhabitant
from
the
open
country
 
the
poor
"
squire
,
as
well
as
the
rich
peer
,
must
have
his
house
in
town
,
and
make
a
figure
with
an
extraordinary
number
of
domestic
.
<EOS>
the
plough
-
boy
,
cow
-
herd
,
and
low
hind
,
be
debauch
and
seduce
by
the
appearance
and
discourse
of
those
coxcomb
in
livery
,
when
they
make
their
summer
excursion
.
<EOS>
They
desert
their
dirt
and
drudgery
,
and
swarm
up
to
London
,
in
hope
of
get
into
service
,
where
they
can
live
luxuriously
and
wear
fine
clothe
,
without
be
oblige
to
work
;
for
idleness
be
natural
to
man
 
great
number
of
these
,
be
disappoint
in
their
expectation
,
become
thief
and
sharper
;
and
London
be
an
immense
wilderness
,
in
which
there
be
neither
watch
nor
ward
of
any
signification
,
nor
any
order
or
police
,
afford
them
lurk
-
place
as
well
as
prey
.
    
<EOS>
there
be
many
cause
that
contribute
to
the
daily
increase
of
this
enormous
mass
;
but
they
may
be
all
resolve
into
the
grand
source
of
luxury
and
corruption
 
about
five
and
twenty
year
ago
,
very
few
,
even
of
the
most
opulent
citizen
of
London
,

any

<EOS>
Their

nothing

plain

<EOS>
at

They

<EOS>
the
gay

be
fill
with
fashionable

upon

will

<EOS>
in
short
,
there
be
no
distinction
or
subordination
lest
 
<EOS>
the
different
department
of
life
be
jumble
together
 
<EOS>
the

in
one

<EOS>
all
be
tumult

one
would
imagine
they

the

I

<EOS>
in
a
word
,
the

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
what

<EOS>
one

<EOS>
as

Vauxhall

ill

and
poorly
execute
;
without
any
unity
of

or
propriety

.
<EOS>
It
be
an
unnatural
assembly
of
object
,
fantastically
illuminate
in
broken
masse
;
seemingly
contrive
to
dazzle
the
eye
and
divert
the
imagination
of
the
vulgar
 
here
a

there
a
stone

in
one

like
a
sepulchral
vault
half

light

in
a
fifth
,
a
scanty

that

<EOS>
the

which
nature

shade

when

I
can
not
help
compassionate
their
temerity
,
while
I
despise
their
want
of
taste
and
decorum
;
but
,
when
they
course
along
those
damp

gloomy
walk
,
or
crowd
together
upon
the
wet
gravel

without
any
other
cover

the

Heaven

listen
to
a
song

which
one
half

can
not
possibly
hear

how
can
I
help
suppose
they
be
actually
possess
by
a
spirit
more
absurd

pernicious
than
any

we
meet
with
in
the
precinct
of
Bedlam

<EOS>
in
all
probability
,
the
proprietor
of
this

and
other
public
garden
of
inferior
note
,
in
the
skirt
of
the
metropolis
,
be
,
in
some
shape
,
connect
with
the
faculty
of
physic
,
and
the
company
of
undertaker
;
for
,
consider
that
eagerness
in
the
pursuit
of
what
be
call
pleasure
,
which
now
predominate
through
every
rank
and
denomination
of
life
,
I
be
persuade

that
more
gout

rheumatism
,
catarrhs
,
and
consumption
be
catch
in
these
nocturnal

sub
die

than
from
all
the
risque

accident
to
which
a
life
of
toil

danger
be
expose
.
    
<EOS>
these
and
other
observation
,
which
I
have
make
in
this
excursion
,
will
shorten
my
stay
at
London
,
and
send
me
back
with
a
double
relish
to
my
solitude
and
mountain
;
but
I
shall
return
by
a
different
route
from

<EOS>
I
have
see
some
old

who
constantly
reside

they

manner

we

another
 
<EOS>
in
our
journey
from
Bath

my

provoke
me
into
a
transport

during

like

I
talk

<EOS>
She
and
her

be
remarkably
quiet

orderly

ever

this
expostulation

<EOS>
how
long
this

Heaven

I

the

I
must
,
in

for

explore
the

<EOS>
They

for

I

I

People

I
make

Our
evening
's
entertainment
<EOS>
be
interrupt
by
an
unlucky
accident
.
<EOS>
in
one
of
the
remotest
walk
we
be
surprised
with
a
sudden
shower
,
that
set
the
whole
company
a
running
,
and
drive
us
in
heap
,
one
upon
another
,
into
the
rotundo
;
where
my
uncle
,
find
himself
wet
,
begin
to
be
very
peevish
and
urgent
to
be
go
.
<EOS>
My
brother
go
to
look
for
the
coach
,
and
find
it
with
much
difficulty
;
but
as
it
could
not
hold
us
all
,
Mr
Barton
stay
behind
.
<EOS>
It
be
some
time
before
the
carriage
could
be
bring
up
to
the
gate
,
in
the
confusion
,
notwithstanding
the
utmost
endeavour
of
our
new
footman
Humphry
Clinker
,
who
lose
his
scratch
periwig
,
and
get
a
broken
head
in
the
scuffle
.
<EOS>
the
moment
we
be
seat
,
my
aunt
pull
off
my
uncle
's
shoe
,
and
carefully
wrap
his
poor
foot
in
her
capuchin
;
then
she
give
him
a
mouth
-
full
of
cordial
,
which
she
always
keep
in
her
pocket
,
and
his
clothe
be
shift
as
soon
as
we
arrive
at
our
lodging
;
so
that
,
bless
be
God
,
he
escape
a
severe
cold
,
of
which
he
be
in
great
terror
.
    
<EOS>
as
for
Mr
Barton
,
I
must
tell
you
in
confidence
,
he
be
a
little
particular
;
but
,
perhaps
,
I
mistake
his
complaisance
;
and
I
wish
I
may
,
for
his
sake
  
<EOS>
You
know
the
condition
of
my
poor
heart
;
which
,
in
spite
of
hard
usage
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
ought
not
to
complain
:
nor
will
I
,
till
,
farther
information
.
    
<EOS>
besides
Ranelagh
and
Vauxhall
,
I
have
be
at
Mrs
Cornely
's
assembly
,
which
,
for
the
room
,
the
company
,
the
dress
,
and
decoration
,
surpasse
all
description
;
but
as
I
have
no
great
turn
for
card
-
playing
,
I
have
not
yet
enter
thoroughly
into
the
spirit
of
the
place
:
indeed
I
be
still
such
a
country
hoyden
,
that
I
could
hardly
find
patience
to
be
put
in
a
condition
to
appear
,
yet
I
be
not
above
six
hour
under
the
hand
of
the
hair
-
dresser
,
who
stuff
my
head
with
as
much
black
wool
as
would
have
make
a
quilt
petticoat
;
and
,
after
all
,
it
be
the
small
head
in
the
assembly
,
except
my
aunt
's
 
She
,
to
be
sure
,
be
so
particular
with
her
rumpt
gown
and
petticoat
,
her
scanty
curl
,
her
lappet
-
head
,
deep
triple
ruffle
,
and
high
stay
,
that
every
body
look
at
her
with
surprise
;
some
whisper
,
and
some
titter
;
and
lady
Griskin
,
by
whom
we
be
introduce
,
flatly
tell
her
,
<EOS>
she
be
twenty
good
year
behind
the
fashion
.
    
<EOS>
Lady
Griskin
be
a
person
of
fashion
,
to
whom
we
have
the
honour
to
be
relate
.
<EOS>
She
keep
a
small
rout
at
her
own
house
,
never
exceed
ten
or
a
dozen
card
-
table
,
but
these
be
frequent
by
the
good
company
in
town
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
so
obliging
as
to
introduce
my
aunt
and
me
to
some
of
her
particular
friend
of
quality
,
who
treat
us
with
the
most
familiar
good
humour
<EOS>
:
we
have
once
dine
with
her
,
and
she
take
the
trouble
to
direct
us
in
all
our
motion
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
happy
as
to
have
gain
her
good
will
to
such
a
degree
,
that
she
sometimes
adjust
my
cap
with
her
own
hand
;
and
she
have
give
me
a
kind
invitation
to
stay
with
her
all
the
winter
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
have
be
cruelly
decline
by
my
uncle
,
who
seem
to
be
(
I
know
not
how
)
prejudice
against
the
good
lady
;
for
,
whenever
my
aunt
happen
to
speak
in
her
commendation
,
I
observe
that
he
make
wry
face
,
though
he
say
nothing
 
<EOS>
perhaps
,
indeed
,
these
grimace
may
be
the
effect
of
pain
arise
from
the
gout
and
rheumatism
,
with
which
he
be
sadly
distressed
 
to
me
,
however
,
he
be
always
good
natured
and
generous
,
even
beyond
my
wish
.
<EOS>
since
we
come
hither
,
he
have
make
me
a
present
of
a
suit
of
clothe
,
with
trimming
and
lace
,
which
cost
more
money
than
I
shall
mention
;
and
Jery
,
at
his
desire
,
have
give
me
my
mother
's
diamond
drop
,
which
be
order
to
be
set
a
-
new
;
so
that
it
will
not
be
his
fault
if
I
do
not
glitter
among
the
star
of
the
fourth
or
fifth
magnitude
.
<EOS>
I
wish
my
weak
head
may
not
grow
giddy
in
the
midst
of
all
this
gallantry
and
dissipation
;
though
,
as
yet
,
I
can
safely
declare
,
I
could
gladly
give
up
all
these
tumultuous
pleasure
,
for
country
solitude
,
and
a
happy
retreat
with
those
we
love
;
among
whom
,
my
dear
Willis
will
always
possess
the
first
place
in
the
breast
of
her
    
ever
affectionate

<EOS>
to
Sir
Watkin
Phillips
,
Bart
.
<EOS>
of
Jesus
college
,
Oxon
.
  
<EOS>
dear
phillips
,
I
send
you
this
letter
,
frank
by
our
old
friend
Barton
;
<EOS>
who
be
as
much
alter
as
it
be
possible
for
a
man
of
his
kidney
to
be
 
<EOS>
instead
of
the
careless
<EOS>
,
indolent
sloven
we
know
at
Oxford
<EOS>
,
I
find
him
a
busy
talkative
politician
;
a
petre
-
maitre
in
his
dress
,
and
a
ceremonious
courtier
in
his
manner
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
gall
enough
in
his
constitution
to
be
inflame
with
the
rancour
of
party
,
so
as
to
deal
in
scurrilous
invective
;
but
,
since
he
obtain
a
place
,
he
be
become
a
warm
partizan
of
the
ministry
,
and
see
every
thing
through
such
an
exaggerate
medium
,
as
to
me
,
who
be
happily
of
no
party
,
be
altogether
incomprehensible
 
<EOS>
without
all
doubt
,
the
fume
of
faction
not
only
disturb
the
faculty
of
reason
,
but
also
pervert
the
organ
of
sense
;
and
I
would
lay
an
hundred
guinea
to
ten
,
that
if
Barton
on
one
side
,
and
the
most
consciencious
patriot
in
the
opposition
on
the
other
,
be
to
draw
,
upon
honour
,
the
picture
of
the
k
#
#
#
#
or
m
#
#
#
#
,
you
and
I
,
who
be
still
uninfected
,
and
unbiased
,
would
find
both
painter
equally
distant
from
the
truth
.
<EOS>
one
thing
,
however
,
must
be
allow
for
the
honour
of
Barton
,
he
never
break
out
into
illiberal
abuse
,
far
less
endeavour
,
by
infamous
calumny
,
to
blast
the
moral
character
of
any
individual
,
on
the
other
side
.
    
<EOS>
ever
since
we
come
hither
,
he
have
be
remarkably
assiduous
in
his
attention
to
our
family
;
an
attention
,
which
in
a
man
of
his
indolence
and
avocation
,
I
should
have
think
altogether
odd
,
and
even
unnatural
,
have
not
I
perceive
that
my
sister
Liddy
have
make
some
impression
upon
his
heart
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
I
have
any
objection
to
his
try
his
fortune
in
this
pursuit
;
if
an
opulent
estate
,
and
a
great
stock
of
good
-
nature
be
sufficient
qualification
in
a
husband
,
to
render
the
marriage
-
state
happy
for
life
,
she
may
be
happy
with
Barton
:
<EOS>
but
,
I
imagine
,
there
be
something
else
require
to
engage
and
secure
the
affection
of
a
woman
of
sense
and
delicacy
:
something
which
nature
have
deny
our
friend
 
Liddy
seem
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
.
<EOS>
when
he
address
himself
to
her
in
discourse
,
she
seem
to
listen
with
reluctance
,
and
industriously
avoid
all
particular
communication
;
but
in
proportion
to
her
coyness
,
our
aunt
be
come
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
go
more
than
half
way
to
meet
his
advance
;
she
mistake
,
or
affect
to
mistake
,
<EOS>
the
meaning
of
his
courtesy
,
which
be
rather
formal
and
fulsome
<EOS>
;
she
return
his
compliment
with
hyperbolical
interest
,
she
persecute
him
with
her
civility
at
table
,
she
appeal
to
him
for
ever
in
conversation
,
she
sigh
,
and
flirt
,
and
ogle
,
and
by
her
hideous
affectation
and
impertinence
,
drive
the
poor
courtier
to
the
very
extremity
of
his
complaisance
:
in
short
,
she
seem
to
have
undertake
the
siege
of
Barton
's
heart
,
and
carry
on
her
approach
in
such
a
desperate
manner
,
that
I
do
not
know
whether
he
will
not
be
oblige
to
capitulate
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
his
aversion
to
this
inamorata
struggle
with
his
acquire
affability
,
and
his
natural
fear

three
time

tell

will
carry
my

thither

that
he
may
see

learn

avoid

for

I
think

an
english
gentleman
never
appear
to
such
disadvantage

as
at
the
levee
of
a
minister

shall
say
nothing
at
present

that
for
thirty
year
he
be
the
constant
and
common
but
of
ridicule
and
execration

<EOS>
He
be
generally
laugh
at
as
an
ape
in
politic
,
whose
office
and
influence
serve
only
to
render
his
folly
the
more
notorious
;
and
the
opposition
curse
him
,
as
the
indefatigable
drudge
of
a
first

mover
,
who
be
justly
stile
and
stigmatize
as
the
father
of
corruption
:
but
this
ridiculous
ape
,
this
venal
drudge
,
no
sooner
lose
the
place
he
be
so
ill
qualified
to
fill
,
and
unfurl
the
banner
of
faction
,
than
he
be
metamorphose
into
a
pattern
of
public
virtue
;
the
very
people
who
revile
him
before

now
extoll
him
to
the
sky
,
as
a
wise

experienced
statesman

chief
pillar

corner
stone

liberty

I

at

the
truth
be
,
since
the
adventure
of
salt
-
hill
,
Mrs
Tabby
seem
to
be
entirely
change
.
<EOS>
She
have
leave
off
scold
the
servant
,
an
exercise
which
be
grow
habitual
and
even
seem
necessary
to
her
constitution
;
and
be
become
so
indifferent
to
Chowder
,
as
to
part
with
him
in
a
present
to
lady
Griskin
,
who
propose
to
bring
the
breed
of
him
into
fashion
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
be
the
widow
of
sir
Timothy
Griskin
,
a
distant
relation
of
our
family
.
<EOS>
She
enjoy
a
jointure
of
five
hundred
pound
a
-
year
,
and
make
shift
to
spend
three
time
that
sum
.
<EOS>
Her
character
before
marriage
be
a
little
equivocal
;
but
at
present
she
live
in
the
bon
ton
,
keep
card
table
,
give
private
supper
to
select
friend
,
and
be
visit
by
person
of
the
first
fashion
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
remarkably
civil
to
us
all
,
and
cultivate
my
uncle
with
the
most
particular
regard
;
but
the
more
she
stroke
him
,
the
more
his
bristle
seem
to
rise
 
to
her
compliment
he
make
very
laconic
and
dry
return
 
<EOS>
T'other
day
,
she
send
us
a
pottle
of
fine
strawberry
,
which
he
do
not
receive
without
sign
of
disgust
,
mutter
from
the
Aeneid
,
timeo
Danaos
et
Dona
ferente
.
<EOS>
She
have
twice
call
for
Liddy
,
of
a
forenoon
,
to
take
an
airing
in
the
coach
;
but
Mrs
Tabby
be
always
so
alert
,
(
I
suppose
by
his
direction
)
that
she
never
could
have
the
niece
without
her
aunt
's
company
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
endeavour
to
sound
Square
-
toe
on
this
subject
;
but
he
carefully
avoid
all
explanation
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
now
,
dear
phillip
,
fill
a
whole
sheet
;
and
if
you
have
read
it
to
an
end
,
I
dare
say
,
you
be
as
tired
as
    
your
humble

London
,
June

.
    
<EOS>
to
Dr
Lewis
.
  
<EOS>
yes
,
Doctor
I
have
see
the
British
Museum
;
which
be
a
noble
collection
,
and
even
stupendous
,
if
we
consider
it
be
make
by
a
private
man
,
a
physician
,
who
be
oblige
to
make
his
own
fortune
at
the
same
time
:
but
great
as
the
collection
be
,
it
would
appear
more
striking
if
it
be
arrange
in
one
spacious
saloon
,
instead
of
be
divide
into
different
apartment
,
which
it
do
not
entirely
fill
 
<EOS>
I
could
wish
the
series
of
medal
be
connect
,
and
the
whole
of
the
animal
,
vegetable
,
and
mineral
kingdom
complete
,
by
add
to
each
at
the
public
expence
,
those
article
that
be
want
.
<EOS>
It
would
likewise
be
a
great
improvement
.
<EOS>
with
respect
to
the
library
,
if
the
deficiency
be
make
up
,
by
purchase
all
the
book
of
character
that
be
not
to
be
find
already
in
the
collection
 
<EOS>
They
may
be
class
in
century
,
accord
to
the
date
of
their
publication
,
and
catalogue
print
of
them
and
the
manuscript
,
for
the
information
of
those
that
want
to
consult
,
or
compile
from
such
authority
.
<EOS>
I
could
also
wish
for
the
honour
of
the
nation
,
that
there
be
a
complete
apparatus
for
a
course
of
mathematic
,
mechanic
,
and
experimental
philosophy
;
and
a
good
salary
settle
upon
an
able
professor
,
who
should
give
regular
lecture
on
these
subject
.
    
<EOS>
but
this
be
all
idle
speculation
,
which
will
never
be
reduce
to
practice
 
<EOS>
consider
the
temper
of
the
time
,
it
be
a
wonder
to
see
any
institution
whatsoever
establish
,
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
.
<EOS>
the
spirit
of
party
be
rise
to
a
kind
of
phrenzy
,
unknown
to
former
age
,
or
rather
degenerate
to
a
total
extinction
of
honesty
and
candour
 
<EOS>
You
know
I
have
observe
,
for
some
time
,
that
the
public
paper
be
become
the
infamous
vehicle
of
the
most
cruel
and
perfidious
defamation
:
<EOS>
every
rancorous
knave
 
<EOS>
every
desperate
incendiary
,
that
can
afford
to
spend
half
a
crown
or
three
shilling
,
<EOS>
may
skulk
behind
the
press
of
a
news
-
monger
,
and
have
a
stab
at
the
first
character
in
the
kingdom
,
without
run
the
least
hazard
of
detection
,
or
punishment
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
make
acquaintance
with
a
Mr
Barton
,
whom
Jery
know
at
Oxford
;
a
good
sort
of
a
man
,
though
most
ridiculously
warped
in
his
political
principle
;
but
his
partiality
be
the
less
offensive
,
as
it
never
appear
in
the
stile
of
scurrility
and
abuse
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
member
of
parliament
,
and
a
retainer
to
the
court
;
and
his
whole
conversation
turn
upon
the
virtue
and
perfection
of
the
minister
,
who
be
his
patron
.
<EOS>
t'other
day
,
when
he
be
bedaub
one
of
those
worthy
,
with
the
most
fulsome
praise
,
I
tell
him
I
have
see
the
same
nobleman
characterise
very
differently
,
in
one
of
the
daily
-
paper
;
indeed
,
so
stigmatize
,
that
if
one
half
of
what
be
say
of
him
be
true
,
he
must
be
not
only
unfit
to
rule
,
but
even
unfit
to
live
:
that
those
impeachment
have
be
repeat
again
and
again
,
with
the
addition
of
fresh
matter
;
and
that
as
he
have
take
no
step
towards
his
own
vindication
,
I
begin
to
think
there
be
some
foundation
for
the
charge
.
"
<EOS>
and
pray
,
sir
,
(
say
Mr
Barton
)
<EOS>
what
step
would
you
have
him
take
?
  
<EOS>
suppose
he
should
prosecute
the
publisher
,
who
screen
the
anonymous
accuser
,
and
bring
him
to
the
pillory
for
a
libel
;
this
be
so
far
from
be
count
a
punishment
,
in
terrorem
,
that
it
will
probably
make
his
fortune
.
<EOS>
the
multitude
immediately
take
him
into
their
protection
,
as
a
martyr
to
the
cause
of
defamation
,
which
they
have
always
espouse
 
<EOS>
They
pay
his
fine
,
they
contribute
to
the
increase
of
his
stock
,
his
shop
his
crowd
with
customer
and
the
sale
of
his
paper
<EOS>
rise
in
proportion
to
the
scandal
it
contain
.
<EOS>
all
this
time
the
prosecutor
be
inveigh
against
as
a
tyrant
and
oppressor
,
for
have
choose
to
proceed
by
the
way
of
information
,
which
be
deem
a
grievance
;
but
if
he
lay
an
action
for
damage
,
he
must
prove
the
damage
,
and
I
leave
you
to
judge
,
whether
a
gentleman
's
character
may
not
be
bring
into
contempt
,
and
all
his
view
in
life
blast
by
calumny
,
without
his
be
able
to
specify
the
particular
of
the
damage
he
have
sustain
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
the
spirit
of
defamation
be
a
kind
of
heresy
,
that
thrive
under
persecution
.
<EOS>
the
liberty
of
the
press
be
a
term
of
great
efficacy
;
and
,
like
that
of
the
protestant
religion
,
have
often
serve
the
purpose
of
sedition
 
<EOS>
a
minister
,
therefore
,
must
arm
himself
with
patience
,
and
bear
those
attack
without
repine
 
whatever
mischief
they
may
do
in
other
respect
,
the
certainly
contribute
in
one
particular
,
to
the
advantage
of
government
;
for
those
defamotory
article
have
multiply
paper
in
such
a
manner
,
and
augment
their
sale
to
such
a
degree
,
that
the
duty
upon
stamp
and
advert
sement
have
make
a
very
considerable
addition
to
the
revenue

<EOS>
"
certain
it
be
,
a
gentleman
's
honour
be
a
very
delicate
subject
to
be
handle
by
a
jury
,
compose
of
man
,
who
can
not
be
suppose
remarkable
either
for
sentiment
or
impartiality
  
<EOS>
in
such
a
case
,
indeed
,
the
defendant
be
try
,
not
only
by
his
peer
but
also
by
his
party
;
and
I
really
think
,
that
,
of
all
patriot
,
he
be
the
most
resolute
who
expose
himself
to
such
detraction
,
for
the
sake
of
his
country
 
<EOS>
if
,
from
the
ignorance

partiality
of

a

can
have
no
redress
from
law

for
be
defame
in
a
pamphlet

news

I
know
<EOS>
but
one
other
method
of
proceed
against
the
publisher

which
be
attend
with
some
risque

have
be
practise
successfully

more

<EOS>
a
regiment
of
horse
be
represent

have
misbehave
at
Dettingen

a
captain

that
regiment

the
publisher

bone
tell
him
,
at
the
same
time
,
if
he

he
should
certainly
have
the
like
salutation
from
every
officer
of

<EOS>
Governor
#

take
the

satisfaction
on
the
rib
of
an
author
,
who
traduce
him
by
name
in
a
periodical
paper
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
a
low
fellow
of
the
same
class
,
who
,
be
turn
out
of
Venice
for
his
impudence
and
scurrility
,
retire
to
Lugano
,
a
town
of
the
Grisons
,
(
a
free
people
,
God
wot
)
where
he
find
a
printing
press
,
from
whence
he
squirt
his
filth
at
some
respectable
character
in
the
republic
,
which
he
have
be
oblige
to
abandon
.
<EOS>
some
of
these

find
him
out
of
the
reach
of
legal
chastisement
,
employ
certain
useful
instrument
,
such
as
may
be
find
in
all
country
,
to
give
him
the
bastinado
;
which
,
be
repeat
more
than
once
,
effectually
stopt
the
current
of
his
abuse
.
    
<EOS>
as
for
the
liberty
of
the
press
,
like
every
other
privilege
,
it
must
be
restrain
within
certain
bound
;
for
if
it
be
carry
to
a
breach
of
law
,
religion
,
and
charity
,
it
become
one
of
the
great
evil
that
ever
annoy
the
community
.
<EOS>
if
the
low
ruffian
may
stab
your
good
name
with
impunity
in
England
,
will
you
be
so
uncandid
as
to
exclaim
against
Italy
for
the
practice

common
assassination
?
<EOS>
to
what
purpose
be
our
property
secure
,
if
our
moral
character
be
leave
defencless
?
<EOS>
People
thus
bate

grow
desperate
;
and
the
despair
of
be
able
to
preserve
one
's
character
,
untainte
by
such
vermin

produce
a
total
neglect
of

so
that
one
of
the
chief
incitement

of
virtue
be
effectually
destroy

<EOS>
Mr
Barton
's
last
consideration
,
respect
the
stamp
duty
,
be
equally
wise
and
laudable
with
another
maxim
which
have
be
long
adopt
by
our
financier
,
namely
,
to
connive
at
drunkenness
,
riot
,
and
dissipation
,
because
they
inhance
the
receipt
of
the
excise
;
not
reflect
,
that
in
provide
this
temporary
convenience
,
they
be
destroy
the
moral
,
health
,
and
industry
of
the
people
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
my
contempt
for
those
who
flatter
a
minister
,
I
think
there
be
something
still
more
despicable
in
flatter
a
mob
.
<EOS>
when
I
see
a
man
of
birth
,
education
,
and
fortune
,
put
himself
on
a
level
with
the
dreg
of
the
people
,
mingle
with
low
mechanic
,
feed
with
them
at
the
same
board
,
and
drink
with
them
in
the
same
cup
,
flatter
their
prejudice
,
harangue
in
praise
of
their
virtue
,
expose
themselves
to
the
belching
of
their
beer
,
the
fume
of
their
tobacco
,
the
grossness
of
their
familiarity
,
and
the
impertinence
of
their
conversation
,
I
can
not
help
despise
him
,
as
a
man
guilty
of
the
vile
prostitution
,
in
order
to
effect
a
purpose
equally
selfish
and
illiberal
.
    
<EOS>
I
should
renounce
politic
the
more
willingly
,
if
I
could
find
other
topic
of
conversation
,
discuss
with
more
modesty
and
candour
;
but
the
daemon
of
party
seem
to
have
usurp
every
department
of
life
.
<EOS>
even
the
world
of
literature
and
taste
be
divide
into
the
most
virulent
faction
,
which
revile
,
decry
,
and
traduce
the
work
of
one
another

<EOS>
yesterday
,
I
go
to
return
an
afternoon
's
visit
to
a
gentleman
of
my
acquaintance
,
at
whose
house
I
find
one
of
the
author
of
the
present
age
,
who
have
write
with
some
success
 
<EOS>
as
I
have
read
one
or
two
of
his
performance
,
which
give
me
pleasure
,
I
be
glad
of
this
opportunity
to
know
his
person
;
but
his
discourse
,
and
deportment
destroy
all
the
impression
which
his
writing
have
make
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
He
take
upon
him
to
decide
dogmatically
upon
every
subject
,
without
deign
to
shew
the
least
cause
for
his
differ
from
the
general
opinion
of
mankind
,
as
if
it
have
be
our
duty
to
acquiesce
in
the
ipse
dixit
of
this
new
Pythagoras
.
<EOS>
He
rejudge
the
character
of
all
the
principal
author
,
who
have
die
within
a
century
of
the
present
time
;
and
,
in
this
revision
,
pay
no
sort
of
regard
to
the
reputation
they
have
acquire
 
Milton
be
harsh
and
prosaic
;
Dryden
,
languid
and
verbose
;
Butler
and
Swift
,
without
humour
;
Congreve
,
without
wit
;
and
Pope
destitute
of
any
sort
of
poetical
merit
 
<EOS>
as
for
his
cotemporarie
,
he
could
not
bear
to
hear
one
of
them
mention
with
any
degree
of
applause
 
<EOS>
They
be
all
dunce
,
pedant
,
plagiarie
,
quack
,
and
impostor
;
and
you
could
not
name
a
single
performance
,
but
what
be
tame
,
stupid
,
and
insipid
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
own
,
that
this
writer
have
nothing
to
charge
his
conscience
with
,
on
the
side
of
flattery
;
for
,
I
understand
,
he
be
never
know
to
praise
one
line
that
be
write
,
even
by
those
with
whom
he
live
on
term
of
good
fellowship
.
<EOS>
this
arrogance
and
presumption
,
in
depreciate
author
,
for
whose
reputation
the
company
may
be
interested
,
be
such
an
insult
upon
the
understanding
,
as
I
could
not
bear
without
wince
.
    
<EOS>
I
desire
to
know
his
reason
for
decry
some
work
,
which
have
afford
me
uncommon
pleasure
;
and
,
as
demonstration
do
not
seem
to
be
his
talent
,
I
dissent
from
his
opinion
with
great
freedom
.
<EOS>
have
be
spoil
by
the
deference
and
humility
of
his
hearer
,
he
do
not
bear
contradiction
with
much
temper
;
and
the
dispute
may
have
grow
warm
,
have
it
not
be
interrupt
by
the
entrance
of
a
rival
bard
,
at
whose
appearance
he
always
quit
the
place
 
They
be
of
different
cabal
,
and
have
be
at
open
war
these
twenty
year
 
<EOS>
if
the
other
be
dogmatical
,
this
genius
be
declamatory
:
he
do
not
discourse
,
but
harangue
;
and
his
oration
be
equally
tedious
and
turgid
.
<EOS>
He
too
pronounce
ex
cathedra
upon
the
character
of
his
cotemporarie
;
and
though
he
scruple
not
to
deal
out
praise
,
even
lavishly
,
to
the

for
my

I
be
shocked

find

nothing

illiberal

<EOS>
I
be
inclined
to
think
,
no
mind
be
ever
wholly
exempt
from
envy
;
which
,
perhaps
,
may
have
be
implant
,
as
an
instinct
essential
to
our
nature

<EOS>
I
be
afraid
we
sometimes
palliate
this
vice
,
under
the
specious
name
of
emulation
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
a
person
remarkably
generous
,
humane
,
moderate
,
and
apparently
self

deny
,
who
could
not
hear
even
a
friend
commend
,
without
betray
mark
of
uneasiness

as
if
that
commendation
have
imply
an
odious
comparison

every
wreath
of
praise
add
to
the
other

be
a

this
be
a
malignant
specie
of
jealousy

of
which
I
stand
acquitted
in
my
own
conscience
 
<EOS>
whether
it
be
a
vice
,
or
an
infirmity

I
leave
you
to
inquire

<EOS>
there
be
another
point
,
which
I
would
much
rather
see
determined
;
whether
the
world
be
always
as
contemptible
,
as
it
appear
to
me
at

<EOS>
if
the
moral
of
mankind
have
not
contract
an
extaraordinary
degree
of
depravity
,
within

then
must
I
be
infect
with
the
common
vice
of

difficilis

querulus

laudatur

or
,
which
be
more
probable
,
the
impetuous
pursuit

avocation
of

have
formerly
hinder
me
from
observe
those
rotten
part

which
now
appear
so
offensively

We

His

have
be

he
now
fill
do
not
imply
the
tenth
part
of
the
influence

which
he
exert
in
his

he
have
give

to
understand

that
they
can
not
oblige
him
in
any
thing
more

than
in
contribute
to
support
the
shadow
of
that
power
which
he
no

retain
in
substance

and
therefore
he
have
still
public
day
,
on
which
they
appear

My

prefer
almost
every

now
fill
the
bench
of
bishop

but
,
in
all
probability
,
the
gratitude
of
the
clergy
be
like
their
charity
,
which
shun
the
light
 
<EOS>
Mr
Barton
be
immediately
accost
by

<EOS>
well
striken

tall

raw
bone

with
a
hooked

I
have
have
the
history
of
him
more

from
another
quarter
 
He
have
be

many
year

concerned
in
fraudulent
practice

as

himself
in

He
be

in

employ
by

he

fortunately

the

He

several

<EOS>
this
visit

you
will
see
how
this

will
receive
it
as
a
mark
of
attachment

certain
it
be

the

seem
eager
to
acknowledge
the
complement
 
a
door
opening

he
suddenly
bolt
out
,
with
a
shaving
cloth
under
his
chin

his

froth
up

he
retreat
into

leave
the

in
some
confusion

after

pause

he
wheel
about

,
go
round
the
levee

speak
to
every
individual

with
the
most
courteous
familiarity

he
scarce
ever
open
his
mouth
without
make
some
blunder
,
in
relation
to
the
person

business
of
the
party
with
whom
he
converse

so
that
he
really
look
like
a
comedian

burlesque
the
character

at
length

prepossessing
appearance

him

almost
the
only
man

have
any
concern

<EOS>
indeed
,
he
would
have
no
concern
at
all
in
the
matter

if
the
ministry
do
not
find
it
absolutely
necessary
to
make
use
of
his
talent
upon
some
particular
occasion
 
<EOS>
as
for
the
common
business
of
the
nation

it
be
carry
on
in
a
constant
routine
by
the
clerk
of
the
different
office

otherwise
the
wheel
of
government
would
be
wholly
stopt
amidst
the
abrupt
succession
of
minister

every
one
more
ignorant
than
his
predecessor

I
be
think
what
a
fine
hovel
we
should
be
in

if
all
the
clerk
of
the
treasury

of
the
secretary

office

the
admiralty

should
take
it
in
their
head
to
throw
up
their
place
in
imitation
of
the
great
pensioner
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
to
return
to
c####t
#
#
#
#
;
he
certainly
know
more
than
all
the
ministry
and
all
the
opposition
,
if
their
head
be
lay
together
,
and
talk
like
an
angel

vast
variety

subject

<EOS>
He
would
really
be
a
great
man

if
he
have
any
consistency
or
stability
of
character
 
<EOS>
then
it
must
be
own
,
he
want
courage

otherwise
he
would
never
allow
himself
to
be
cow
by
the
great
political
bully
,
for
whose
understanding
he
have
justly
a
very
great
contempt
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
him
as
much
afraid
of
that
overbearing
Hector
,
as
ever
school

boy
be
of
his
pedagogue
;
and
yet
this
Hector

I
shrewdly
suspect

be
no
more
than
a
craven
at
bottom
 
<EOS>
besides
this
defect
,
C

#
#
#
have
another
,
which
he
be
at
too
little
pain
to
hide
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
faith
to
be
give
to
his
assertion
,
and
no
trust
to
be
put
in
his
promise
 
however
to
give
the
Devil
his
due
<EOS>
,
he
be
very
good

natured
;
and
even
friendly
,
when
close
urge
in

way
of
solicitation
  
<EOS>
as
for
principle
,
that
be
out
of
the
question
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
he
be
a
wit
and
an
orator
,
extremely
entertaining
,
and
he
shine
very
often
at
the
expence
even
of
those
minister
to
whom
he
be
a
retainer
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
mark
of
great
imprudence

by
which
he
have
make
them
all
his

whatever
face
they
may
put
upon

sooner

will
have
cause

he
have
be
able

keep
his

I
have
several

caution
him

so
divert
with
his
anecdote
,
that
he
ask
him
to
dinner
,
and
treat
him
with
a
fine
turbot
,
to
which
he
do
ample
justice
 
<EOS>
that
same
evening
I
spend
at
the
tavern
with
some
friend
,
one
of
whom
let
me
into
c

's
character
,
which
Mr
Bramble
no
sooner
understand
,
than
he
express
some
concern
for
the
connection
he
have
make
and
resolve
to
disengage
himself
from
it
without
,
ceremony
.
    
<EOS>
We
be
become
member
of
the
Society
for
the
Encouragement
of
the
art
,
and
have
assist
at
some
of
their
deliberation
,
which
be
conduct
with
equal
spirit
and
sagacity
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
be
extremely
fond
of
the
institution
,
which
will
certainly
be
productive
of
great
advantage
to
the
public
,
if
,
from
its
democratical
form
,
it
do
not
degenerate
into
cabal
and
corruption
 
<EOS>
You
be
already
acquaint
with
his
aversion
to
the
influence
of
the
multitude
,
which
he
affirm
,
be
incompatible
with
excellence
,
and
subversive
of
order
 
<EOS>
indeed
his
detestation
of
the
mob
have
be
heighten
by
fear
,
ever
since
he
faint
in
the
room
at
Bath
;
and
this
apprehension
have
prevent
him
from
go
to
the
Little
Theatre
in
the
Hay
-
market
,
and
other
place
of
entertainment
,
to
which
,
however
,
I
have
have
the
honour
to
attend
the
lady
.
    
<EOS>
It
grate
old
Square
-
Toes
to
reflect
,
that
it
be
not
in
his
power
to
enjoy
even
the
most
elegant
diversion
of
the
capital
,
without
the
participation
of
the
vulgar
;
for
they
now
thrust
themselves
into
all
assembly
,
from
a
ridotto
at
St.
James
's
,
to
a
hop
at
Rotherhithe
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
lately
see
our
old
acquaintance
<EOS>
Dick
Ivy
,
who
we
imagine
have
die
of
dram
-
drinking
;
but
he
be
lately
emerge
from
the
Fleet
,
by
mean
of
a
pamphlet
which
he
write
and
publish
against
the
government
with
some
success
.
<EOS>
the
sale
of
this
performance
enable
him
to
appear
in
clean
linen
,
and
he
be
now
go
about
soliciting
subscription
,
for
his
Poems
;
but
his
breech
be
not
yet
in
the
most
decent
order
.
    
<EOS>
Dick
certainly
deserve
some
countenance
for
his
intrepidity
and
perseverance
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
the
power
of
disappointment
,
nor
even
of
damnation
,
to
drive
him
to
despair
 
<EOS>
after
some
unsuccessful
essay
in
the
way
of
poetry
,
he
commence
brandy
-
merchant
,
and
I
believe
his
whole
stock
run
out
through
his
own
bowel
;
then
he
consort
with
a
milkwoman
,
who
keep
a
cellar
in
Petty
France
:
but
he
could
not
make
his
quarter
good
,
he
be
dislodge
and
drive
up
stair
into
the
kennel
by
a
corporal
in
the
second
regiment
of
foot
-
guard
 
<EOS>
He
be
afterwards
the
laureat
of
Blackfriers
,
<EOS>
from
whence
there
be
a
natural
transition
to
the
Fleet
 
<EOS>
as
he
have
formerly
miscarry
in
panegyric
,
he
now
turn
his
thought
to
satire
,
and
really
seem
to
have
some
talent
for
abuse
.
<EOS>
if
he
can
hold
out
till
the
meeting
of
the
parliament
,
and
be
prepare
for
another
charge
,
in
all
probability
Dick
will
mount
the
pillory
,
or
obtain
a
pension
,
in
either
of
which
event
his
fortune
will
be
make
 
mean
while
he
have
acquire
some
degree
of
consideration
with
the
respectable
writer
of
the
age
;
and
as
I
have
subscribe
for
his
work
,
he
do
me
the
favour
t'other
night
to
introduce
me
to
a
society
of
those
genius
;
but
I
find
them
exceed
formal
and
reserved
  
<EOS>
They
seem
afraid
and
jealous
of
one
another
,
and
sit
in
a
state
of
mutual
repulsion
,
like
so
many
particle
of
vapour
,
each
surround
by
its
own
electrify
atmosphere
.
<EOS>
Dick
,
who
have
more
vivacity
than
judgment
,
try
more
than
once
to
enliven
the
conversation
;
sometimes
make
an
effort
at
wit
,
sometimes
let
off
a
pun
,
and
sometimes
discharge
a
conundrum
;
nay
at
length
he
start
a
dispute
upon
the
hackneye
comparison
betwixt
blank
verse
and
rhyme
,
and
the
professor
open
with
great
clamour
;
but
,
instead
of
keep
to
the
subject
,
they
launch
out
into
tedious
dissertation
on
the
poetry
of
the
ancient
;
and
one
of
them
who
have
be
a
school
-
master
,
display
his
whole
knowledge
of
prosody
,
glean
from
Disputer
and
Ruddiman
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
I
venture
to
say
,
I
do
not
see
how
the
subject
in
question
could
be
at
all
elucidate
by
the
practice
of
the
ancient
,
who
certainly
have
neither
blank
verse
nor
rhyme
in
their
poem
,
which
be
measure
by
foot
,
whereas
our
be
reckon
by
the
number
of
syllable
 
<EOS>
this
remark
seem
to
give
umbrage
to
the
pedant
,
who
forthwith
involve
himself
in
a
cloud
of
greek
and
latin
quotation
,
which
nobody
attempt
to
dispel
 
a
confused
hum
of
insipid
observation
and
comment
ensue
;
and
,
upon
the
whole
,
I
never
pass
a
dull
evening
in
my
life
 
<EOS>
yet
,
without
all
doubt
,
some
of
them
be
man
of
learning
,
wit
,
and
ingenuity
.
<EOS>
as
they
be
afraid
of
make
free
with
one
another
,
they
should
bring
each
his
but
,
or
whet
-
stone
,
along
with
him
,
for
the
entertainment
of
the
company
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
say
,
he
never
desire
to
meet
with
more
than
one
wit
at
a
time
 
one
wit
like
a
nuckle
of
ham
in
soup
,
give
a
zest
and
flavour
to
the
dish
;
but
more
than
one
serve
only
to
spoil
the
pottage
 
<EOS>
and
now
I
be
afraid
I
have
give
you
an
unconscionable
mess
,
without
any
flavour
at
all
,
for
which
,
I
suppose
,
you
will
bestow
your
benediction
upon
    
your

<EOS>
DEAR
LEWIS
,
your
fable
of
the
monkey
and
the
pig
,
be
what
the
Italians
call
ben
trovata
:
but
I
shall
not
repeat
it
to
my
apothecary
,
who
be
a
proud
Scotchman
,
very
thin
skinned
,
and
,
for
aught
I
know
,
may
have
his
degree
in
his
pocket
 
<EOS>
a
right
Scotchman
have
always
two
string
to
his
bow
,
and
be
in
utrumque
paratus
 
certain
<EOS>
it
be
,
I
have
not
"
scape
a
scouring
;
but
I
believe
,
by
mean
of
that
scouring
,
I
have
"
scape
something
bad
,
perhaps
a
tedious
fit
of
the
gout
or
rheumatism
;
for
my
appetite
begin
to
flagg
,
and
I
have
certain
croaking
in
the
bowel
which
bode
me
no
good
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
be
not
yet
quite
free
of
these
remembrance
,
which
warn
me
to
be
go
from
this
centre
of
infection
     
<EOS>
what
temptation
can
a
man
of
my
turn
and
temperament
<EOS>
have
,
to
live
in
a
place
where
every
corner
teem
with
fresh
object
of
detestation
and
disgust
?
<EOS>
what
kind
of
taste
and
organ
must
those
people
have
,
who
really
prefer
the
adulterate
enjoyment
of
the
town
to
the
genuine
pleasure
of
a
country
retreat
?
<EOS>
Most
people
,
I
know
,
be
originally
seduce
by
vanity
,
ambition
,
and
childish
curiosity
;
which
can
not
be
gratify
,
but
in
the
busy
haunt
of
man
:
but
,
in
the
course
of
this
gratification
,
their
very
organ
of
sense
be
pervert
,
and
they
become
habitually
lose
to
every
relish
of
what
be
genuine
and
excellent
in
its
own
nature
.
    
<EOS>
Shall
I
state
the
difference
between
my
town
grievance
,
and
my
country
comfort
?
<EOS>
at
Brambleton
-
hall
,
I
have
elbow
-
room
within
door
,
and
breathe
a
clear
,
elastic
,
salutary
air
 
I
enjoy
refresh
sleep
,
which
be
never
disturb
by
horrid
noise
,
nor
interrupt
,
but
in
a
morning
,
by
the
sweet
twitter
of
the
martlet
at
my
window
 
<EOS>
I
drink
the
virgin
lymph
,
pure
and
crystalline
as
it
gush
from
the
rock
,
or
the
sparkling
beverage
,
home
brew
from
malt
of
my
own
making
;
or
I
indulge
with
cider
,
which
my
own
orchard
afford
;
or
with
claret
of
the
good
growth
,
import
for
my
own
use
,
by
a
correspondent
on
whose
integrity
I
can
depend
;
my
bread
be
sweet
and
nourish
,
make
from
my
own
wheat
,
ground
in
my
own
mill

and
bake
in
my
own
oven
,
my
table

in
a
great

furnish
from
my
own
ground
;
my
five

year
old
mutton
,
feed
on
the
fragrant
herbage
of
the
mountain
,
that
may
vie
with
venison
in
juice
and
flavour
;
my
delicious
veal
,
fatten
with
nothing
but
the
mother
's
milk
,
that
fill
the
dish
with
gravy
;
my
poultry
from
the
barn

door
,
that
never
know
confinement
,
but
when
they
be
at
roost
;
my
rabbit
pant
from
the
warren
;
my
game
fresh
from
the
moor
;
my
trout
and
salmon
struggle
from
the
stream
;
oyster
from
their
native
bank
;
and
herring
,
with
other
sea

fish
,
I
can
eat
in
four
hour
after
they
be
take
 
My
sallad
,
root
,
and
pot

herb
,
my
own
garden
yeild
in
plenty
and
perfection
;
the
produce

the
natural
soil

prepare
by
moderate
cultivation
.
<EOS>
the
same
soil
afford
all
the
different
fruit
which
England
may
call
her
own
,
so
that
my
desert
be
every
day
fresh
-
gather
from
the
tree
;
my
dairy
flow
with
nectarious
tide
of
milk
and
cream
,
from
whence
we
derive
abundance
of
excellent
butter
,
curd
,
and
cheese
;
and
the
refuse
fatten
my
pig
,
that
be
destine
for
hams
and
bacon
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
bed
by
time
,
and
rise
with
the
sun
 
<EOS>
I
make
shift
to
pass
the
hour
without
weariness
or
regret
,
and
be
not
destitute
of
amusement
within
door
,
when
the
weather
will
not
permit
me
to
go
abroad
 
<EOS>
I
read
,
and
chat
,
and
play
at
billiard
,
card
,
or
back
-
gammon
 
<EOS>
without
door
,
I
superintend
my
farm
,
and
execute
plan
of
improvement
,
the
effect
of
which
I
enjoy
with
unspeakable
delight
 
<EOS>
nor
do
I
take
less
pleasure
in
see
my
tenant
thrive
under
my
auspex
,
and
the
poor
live
comfortably
by
the
employment
which
I
provide
 
<EOS>
You
know
I
have
one
or
two
sensible
friend
,
to
whom
I
can
open
all
my
heart
;
a
blessing
which
,
perhaps
,
I
may
have
seek
in
vain
among
the
crowded
scene
of
life
:
there
be
few
other
of
more
humble
part
,
whom
I
esteem
for
their
integrity
;
and
their
conversation
I
find
inoffensive
,
though
not
very
entertaining
.
<EOS>
finally
,
I
live
in
the
midst
of
honest
man
,
and
trusty
dependant
,
who
,
I
flatter
myself
,
have
a
disintereste
attachment
to
my
person
 
You
,
yourself
,
my
dear
doctor
,
can
vouch
for
the
truth
of
these
assertion
.
    
<EOS>
now
mark
the
contrast
at
London
 
<EOS>
I
be
pen
up
in
frowzy
lodging
,
where
there
be
not
room
enough
to
swing
a
cat
;
and
I
breathe
the
steam
of
endless
putrefaction
;
and
these
would
,
undoubtedly
,
produce
a
pestilence
,
if
they
be
not
qualify
by
the
gross
acid
of
sea
-
coal
,
which
be
itself
a
pernicious
nuisance
to
lung
of
any
delicacy
of
texture
:
but
even
this
boasted
corrector
can
not
prevent
those
languid
,
sallow
look
,
<EOS>
that
distinguish
the
inhabitant
of
London
from
those
ruddy
swain
that
lead
a
country
life
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
bed
after
mid
-
night
,
jade
and
restless
from
the
dissipation
of
the
day
 
I
start
every
hour
from
my
sleep
,
at
the
horrid
noise
of
the
watchman
bawl
the
hour
through
every
street
,
and
thunder
at
every
door
;
a
set
of
useless
fellow
,
who
serve
no
other
purpose
but
that
of
disturb
the
repose
of
the
inhabitant
;
and
by
five
o'clock
I
start
out
of
bed
,
in
consequence
of
the
still
more
dreadful
alarm
make
by
the
country
cart
,
and
noisy
rustic
bellowing
green
pease
under
my
window
.
<EOS>
if
I
would
drink
water
,
I
must
quaff
the
maukish
content
of
an
open
aqueduct
,
expose
to
all
manner
of
defilement
;
or
swallow
that
which
come
from
the
river
Thames

impregnate
with
all
the
filth

London

Westminster
 
<EOS>
human
excrement
be
the

which

all
the

poison

use
in
mechanic

enrich

mix
with
the
scouring

all
the

within
the

<EOS>
this
be
the
agreeable
potation

extoll
by
the
Londoners
,
as
the
fine
water
in
the
universe
 
<EOS>
as

the
intoxicate
potion

a
vile

unpalatable

pernicious
sophistication

balderdashe

<EOS>
in
an
action

lay
against

a

from
the
evidence

that
there

<EOS>
the

I
eat
in
London

be
a
deleterious
paste

mix
up
with
chalk

alum

bone

ashe

insipid
to
the
taste

and
destructive
to

<EOS>
the
good
people
be
not
ignorant
of
this
adulteration
;
but
they
prefer
it
to
wholesome
bread
,
because
it
be
white
than
the
meal
of
corn
:
thus
they
sacrifice
their
taste

their
health

and
the
life
of
their
tender
infant

to
a
most
absurd
gratification

paralytic

so
void

I
shall
conclude
this

London
dainty

with
that

beer

guiltless

vapid

all
these
enormity
may
be
remedie
with
a

attention
to
the
article
of
police

but
the
wise
patriot
of
London
have
take
it
into
their
head
,
that
all

be
inconsistent

in

I
mention
my
have
spend
an
evening
with
a
society
of
author
,
who
seem
to
be
jealous

afraid

another

<EOS>
My

be
not
at
all
surprised
to
hear
me
say
I
be
disappoint
in
their
conversation

<EOS>
"
a
man
may
be
very
entertaining
and
instructive
upon
paper
,
(
say
he
)
and
exceedingly
dull
in
common
discourse
.
<EOS>
I
have
observe
,
that
those
who
shine
most
in
private
company
,
be
but
secondary
star
in
the
constellation

genius
 
a
small
stock

more
easily

sooner
display

a
great

crowd
together

<EOS>
there
be
very
seldom
any
thing
extraordinary
in
the
appearance
and
address
of
a
good
writer
;
whereas
a
dull
author
generally
distinguish
himself
by
some
oddity
or
extravagance
.
<EOS>
for
this
reason
,
I
fancy
,
that
an
assembly
of
Grubs
must
be
very
divert

<EOS>
My
curiosity
be
excite

this
hint

I
consult
my

undertake

gratify
it

you

I

<EOS>
He
live
in

every
Sunday
his
house
be
open

all
unfortunate
brother

he
treat
with
beef

pudding

port

and
Calvert

<EOS>
He
have
fix
upon
the
first
day
of
the
week
for
the
exercise
of
his
hospitality
,
because
some
of
his
guest
could
not
enjoy
it
on
any
other
,
for
reason
that
I
need
not
explain
.
<EOS>
I
be
civilly
receive
in
a
plain
,
yet
decent
habitation
,
which
open
backwards
into
a
very
pleasant
garden

keep
in
excellent
order

and
indeed
,
I
see
,
none
of
the
outward
sign
of
authorship

either
in
the
house
or
the
landlord

who
be
one
of
those
few
writer
of

stand
upon
their
own
foundation

without
patronage
,
and
above
dependence

<EOS>
if
there

characteristic

I
do
not

may

what
strike
me
be
oddity
originally

afterwards
confirm

<EOS>
one
of

wear
spectacle

another

(
as
Ivy
tell

<EOS>
the
first
be
note

<EOS>
a

once

leap

<EOS>
a

that
he
insist
upon

when
a

the
first
should
be
immediately
send
to
press

that
if
he
persist
in
decline
his

,
he
would
publish
the
satire
without
delay

<EOS>
s

reply
,
that
he
look
upon
Wyvil

panegyrick
,
as
in
effect
,
a
species
of
infamy
,
and
would
resent
it
accordingly
with
a
good
cudgel
;
but
if
he
publish
the
satire
,
he
may
deserve
his
compassion
,
and
have
nothing
to
fear
from
his
revenge
.
<EOS>
Wyvil
have
consider
the

resolve

the

for
which
he
receive
a

drubbing

<EOS>
then
he
swear
the
peace
against
the
agressor
,
who
,
in
order
to
avoid
a
prosecution
,
at

,
admit
him
to
his
good
grace

<EOS>
It
be
the
singularity
in

conduct
on
this
occasion
,
that
reconcile
him
to
the
yellow

gloved

have
some
genius

and
from
that
period
cultivate
his

<EOS>
curious
to
know
upon

I
apply

more
creditable

for

they
translate

collate

and
compile
,
in
the
business
of
book

making
;
and
that
all
of
them
have
,
at
different
time
,
labour
in
the
service
of
our
landlord
,
though
they
have
now
set
up
for
themselves
in
various
department
of
literature
.
<EOS>
not
only
their
talent

but
also
their

no

any

unless

could
bawl
lowder

his

<EOS>
It
must
be
own
,
however
,
there
be
nothing
pedantic
in
their
discourse
;
they
carefully
avoid
all
learn
disquisition
,
and
endeavour
to
be
facetious
;
nor
do
their
endeavour
always
miscarry
 
some
droll
repartee
pass

much

be
excited
;

if
any

he

effectually
check

they

masterly

in

his

happily

Tim

make

at

<EOS>
after
dinner
we
adjourn
into
the
garden
,
where
,
I
observe
,
Mr
S
#

#

give
a
short
separate
audience
to
every
individual
in
a
small
remote
filbert
walk
,
from
whence
most
of
them
drop
off
one
after
another
,
without
further
ceremony
;
but
they
be
replace
by
fresh
recruit
of
the
same
clan
,
who
come
to
make
an
afternoon
's
visit
;
and
,
among
other
,
a
spruce
bookseller
,
call
Birkin
,
who
ride
his
own
gelding
,
and
make
his
appearance
in
a
pair
of
new
jemmy
boot
,
with
massy
spur
of
plate
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
without
reason
that
this
midwife
of
the
muse
use
exercise
a
-
horseback
,
for
he
be
too
fat
to
walk
a
-
foot
,
and
he
undergo
some
sarcasm
from
Tim
Cropdale
,
on
his
unwieldy
size
and
inaptitude
for
motion
.
<EOS>
Birkin
,
who
take
umbrage
at
this
poor
author
's
petulence
in
presume
to
joke
upon
a
man
so
much
rich
than
himself
,
tell
him
,
he
be
not
so
unwieldy
but
that
he
could
move
the
marshalsea
court
for
a
writ
,
and
even
overtake
him
with
it
,
if
he
do
not
very
speedily
come
and
settle
account
with
him
,
respect
the
expence
of
publish
his
last
Ode
to
the
king
of
Prussia
,
of
which
he
have
sell
but
three
,
and
one
of
them
be
to
Whitfield
the
methodist
.
<EOS>
Tim
affect
to
receive
this
intimation
with
good
humour
,
say
,
he
expect
in
a
post
or
two
,
from
Potsdam
,
a
poem
of
thank
from
his
prussian
majesty
,
who
know
very
well
how
to
pay
poet
in
their
own
coin
;
but
,
in
the
mean
time
,
he
propose
,
that
Mr
Birkin
and
he
should
run
three
time
round
the
garden
for
a
bowl
of
punch
,
to
be
drink
at
Ashley
's
in
the
evening
,
and
he
would
run
boot
against
stocking
.
<EOS>
the
bookseller
,
who
value
himself
upon
his
mettle
,
be
persuade
to
accept
the
challenge
,
and
he
forthwith
resign
his
boot
to
Cropdale
,
who
,
when
he
have
put
them
on
,
be
no
bad
representation
of
Captain
Pistol
in
the
play
.
    
<EOS>
every
thing
be
adjust
,
they
start
together
with
great
impetuosity
,
and
,
in
the
second
round
,
Birkin
have
clearly
the
advantage
,
lard
the
lean
earth
as
he
puff'd
along
.
<EOS>
Cropdale
have
no
mind
to
contest
the
victory
further
,
but
,
in
a
twinkling
,
disappear
through
the
back
-
door
of
the
garden
,
which
open
into
a
private
lane
,
that
have
communication
with
the
high
road
.
  
<EOS>
the
spectator
immediately
begin
to
hallo
,
"
steal
away
!
"
<EOS>
and
Birkin
set
off
in
pursuit
of
him
with
great
eagerness
;
but
he
have
not
advance
twenty
yard
in
the
lane
,
when
a
thorn
run
into
his
foot
,
send
him
hop
back
into
the
garden
,
roar
with
pain
,
and
swear
with
vexation
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
deliver
from
this
annoyance
by
the
Scotchman
,
who
have
be
breed
to
surgery
,
he
look
about
him
wildly
,
exclaim
,
"
sure
,
the
fellow
will
not
be
such
a
rogue
as
to
run
clear
away
with
my
boot
!
"
<EOS>
Our
landlord
,
have
reconnoitre
the
shoe
he
have
leave
,
which
,
indeed
,
hardly
deserve
that
name
,
"
pray
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
Mr
Birkin
,
wa'n't
your
boot
make
of
calf
-
skin
?
"
<EOS>
"
calfskin
or
cow
skin
(
reply
the
other
)
<EOS>
I
will
find
a
slip
of
sheep
-
skin
that
will
do
his
business
.
  
<EOS>
I
lose
twenty
pound
by
his
farce
,
which
you
persuade
me
to
buy
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
out
of
pocket
five
pound
by
his
damn'd
ode
;
and
now
this
pair
of
boot
,
bran
new
,
cost
me
thirty
shilling
,
as
per
receipt
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
affair
of
the
boot
be
felony
 
transportation
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
have
the
dog
indict
at
the
Old
Bailey
  
<EOS>
I
will

Mr

.
<EOS>
I
will
be
revenge
,
even
though
I
should
lose
my
debt
in
consequence
of
his
conviction

"
    
<EOS>
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
say
nothing
at
present
,
but
accommodate
him
with
a
pair
of
shoe
;
then
order
his
servant
to
rub
him
down
,
and
comfort
him
with
a
glass
of
rum
punch
,
which
seem
,
in
a
great
measure
,
to
cool
the
rage
of
his
indignation
.
<EOS>
"
after
all
(
say
our
landlord
)
<EOS>
this
be
no
more
than
a
humbug
in
the
way
of
wit
;
though
it
deserve
a
more
respectable
epithet
,
when
consider
as
an
effort
of
invention
.
<EOS>
Tim
being
,
I
suppose
,
out
of
credit
with
the
cordwainer
,
fall
upon
this
ingenious
expedient
to
supply
the
want
of
shoe
,
know
that
Mr
Birkin
,
who
love
humour
,
would
himself
relish
the
joke
upon
a
little
recollection
.
<EOS>
Cropdale
literally
live
by
his
wit
,
which
he
have
exercise
upon
all
his
friend
in
their
turn
.
<EOS>
He
once
borrow
my
poney
for
five
or
six
day
to
go
to
Salisbury
,
and
sell
him
in
Smithfield
at
his
return
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
joke
of
such
a
serious
nature
,
that
,
in
the
first
transport
of
my
passion
,
I
have
some
thought
of
prosecute
him
for
horse
-
stealing
;
and
even
when
my
resentment
have
in
some
measure
subside
,
as
he
industriously
avoid
me
<EOS>
,
I
vow
,
I
would
take
satisfaction
on
his
rib
with
the
first
opportunity
.
<EOS>
one
day
,
see
him
at
some
distance
in
the
street
,
come
towards
me
,
I
begin
to
prepare
my
cane
for
action
,
and
walk
in
the
shadow
of
a
porter
,
that
he
may
not
perceive
me
soon
enough
to
make
his
escape
;
but
,
in
the
very
instant
I
have
lift
up
the
instrument
of
correction
,
I
find
Tim
Cropdale
metamorphose
into
a
miserable
blind
wretch
,
feel
his
way
with
a
long
stick
from
post
to
post
,
and
roll
about
two
bald
unlighted
orb
instead
of
eye
.
<EOS>
I
be
exceedingly
shocked
at
have
so
narrowly
escape
the
concern
and
disgrace
that
would
have
attend
such
a
misapplication
of
vengeance
;
<EOS>
but
,
next
day
,
Tim
prevail
on
a
friend
of
mine
to
come
and
solicit
my
forgiveness
,
and
offer
his
note
,
payable
in
six
week
,
for
the
price
of
the
poney
.
  
<EOS>
this
gentleman
give
me
to
understand
,
that
the
blind
man
be
no
other
than
Cropdale
,
who
have
see
me
advance
,
and
guess
my
intent
,
have
immediately
convert
himself
into
the
object
aforesaid
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
so
divert
at
the
ingenuity
of
the
evasion
,
that
I
agree
to
pardon
his
offence
,
refuse
his
note
,
however
,
that
I
may
keep
a
prosecution
for
felony
hang
over
his
head
,
as
a
security
for
his
future
good
behaviour
 
<EOS>
but
Timothy
would
by
no
means
trust
himself
in
my
hand
till
the
note
be
accept
 
<EOS>
then
he
make
his
appearance
at
my
door
as
a
blind
beggar
,
and
impose
in
such
a
manner
upon
my
man
,
who
have
be
his
old
acquaintance
and
pot
-
companion
,
that
the
fellow
throw
the
door
in
his
face
and
even
threaten
to
give
him
the
bastinado
.
<EOS>
hear
a
noise
in
the
hall
,
I
go
thither
,
and
immediately
recollect
the
figure
I
have
pass
in
the
street
,
accost
him
by
his
own
name
,
to
the
unspeakable
astonishment
of
the
footman
.
"
    
<EOS>
Berkin
declare
he
love
a
joke
as
well
as
another
;
but
ask
if
any
of
the
company
could
tell
where
Mr
Cropdale
lodge
,
that
he
may
send
him
a
proposal
about
restitution
,
before
the
boot
should
be
make
away
with
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
willingly
give
him
a
pair
of
new
shoe
,
(
say
he
)
and
half
a
guinea
into
the
bargain
,
for
the
boot
,
which
fit
me
like
a
glove
,
and
I
shall
not
be
able
to
get
the
fellow
of
them
till
the
good
weather
for
riding
be
over
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
stutter
wit
declare
,
that
the
only
secret
which
Cropdale
ever
keep
,
be
the
place
of
his
lodging
;
but
,
he
believe
,
that
during
the
heat
of
summer
,
he
commonly
take
his
repose
upon
a
bulk
,
or
indulge
himself
in
fresco
with
one
of
the
kennel
-
nymphs
,
under
the
portico
of
St.
Martin
's
church
.
"
<EOS>
pox
on
him
(
cry
the
bookseller
)
<EOS>
he
may
as
well
have
take
my
whip
and
spur
 
in
that
case
,
he
may
have
be
tempt
to
steal
another
horse
,
and
then
he
would
have
rid
to
the
devil
of
course

I
take
my
leave
of
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
with
proper
acknowledgment
of
his
civility
,
and
be
extremely
well
pleased
with
the
entertainment
of
the
day
,
though
not
yet
satisfied
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
this
connexion
betwixt
a
man
of
character
in
the
literary
world
,
and
a
parcel
of
authorling
,
who
,
in
all
probability
,
would
never
be
able
to
acquire
any
degree
of
reputation
by
their
labour
.
<EOS>
on
this
head
I
interrogate
my
conductor
,
Dick
Ivy
,
who
answer
me
to
this
effect
:
"
one
would
imagine
S
#
#
#
#
have
some
view
to
his
own
interest
in
give
countenance
and
assistance
to
those
people
,
whom
he
know
to
be
bad
man
,
as
well
as
bad
writer
;
but
,
if
he
have
any
such
view
,
he
will
find
himself
disappointed
;
for
if
he
be
so
vain
as
to
imagine
he
can
make
them
subservient
to
his
scheme
of
profit
or
ambition
,
they
be
cunne
enough
to
make
him
their
property
in
the
mean
time
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
one
of
the
company
you
have
see
to
-
day
(
myself
except
)
<EOS>
who
do
not
owe
him
particular
obligation
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
them
he
bail
out
of
a
spunging
-
house
,
and
afterwards
pay
the
debt
 
another
he
translate
into
his
family
,
and
cloathe
,
when
he
be
turn
out
half
-
naked
from
gaol
in
consequence
of
an
act
for
the
relief
of
insolvent
debtor
 
<EOS>
a
third
,
who
be
reduce
to
a
woollen
night
-
cap
,
and
live
upon
sheep'
-
trotter
,
up
three
pair
of
stair
backward
in
Butcher
-
row
<EOS>
,
he
take
into
present
pay
and
free
quarter
,
and
enable
him
to
appear
as
a
gentleman
,
without
have
the
fear
of
sheriff
's
officer
before
his
eye
.
<EOS>
those
who
be
in
distress
he
supply
with
money
when
he
have
it
,
and
with
his
credit
when
he
be
out
of
cash
.
<EOS>
when
they
want
business
,
he
either
find
employment
for
them
in
his
own
service
,
or
recommend
them
to
bookseller
to
execute
some
project
he
have
form
for
their
subsistence
.
<EOS>
They
be
always
welcome
to
his
table
,
(
which
,
though
plain
,
be
plentiful
)
and
to
his
good
office
as
far
as
they
will
go
;
and
when
they
see
occasion
,
they
make
use
of
his
name
with
the
most
petulant
familiarity
;
<EOS>
nay
,
they
do
not
even
scruple
to
arrogate
to
themselves
the
merit
of
some
of
his
performance
,
and
have
be
know
to
sell
their
own
lucubration
as
the
produce
of
his
brain
.
<EOS>
the
Scotchman
you
see
at
dinner
once
personate
him
at
an
ale
-
house
in
West
-
Smithfield
,
and
,
in
the
character
of
S
#
#
#
#
,
have
his
head
break
by
a
cow
-
keeper
,
for
have
speak
disrespectfully
of
the
christian
religion
;
but
he
take
the
law
of
him
in
his
own
person
,
and
the
assailant
be
fain
to
give
him
ten
pound
to
withdraw
his
action
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
I
observe
,
that
all
this
appearance
of
liberality
on
the
side
of
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
be
easily
account
for
,
on
the
supposition
that
they
flatter
him
in
private
,
and
engage
his
adversary
in
public
;
and
yet
I
be
astonish
,
when
I
recollect
that
I
often
have
see
this
writer
virulently
abuse
in
paper
,
poem
,
and
pamphlet
,
and
not
a
pen
be
draw
in
his
defence
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
be
more
astonished
(
say
he
)
when
I
assure
you
,
those
very
guest
whom
you
see
at
his
table
to
-
day
,
be
the
author
of
great
part
of
that
abuse
;
and
he
himself
be
well
aware
of
their
particular
favour
,
for
they
be
all
eager
to
detect
and
betray
one
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
this
be
do
the
devil
's
work
for
nothing
(
cry
I.
)
<EOS>
what
should
induce
them
to
revile
their
benefactor
without
provocation
?
"
<EOS>
"
Envy
(
answer
Dick
)
be
the
general
incitement
;
but
they
be
gall
by
an
additional
scourge
of
provocation
.
<EOS>
s
#

direct
a
literary
journal
,
in
which
their
production
be
necessarily
bring
to
trial
;
and
though
many
of
them
have
be
treat
with
such
lenity
and
favour
as
they
little
deserved
,
yet
the
slight
censure
,
such
as
,
perhaps
,
could
not
be
avoid
with
any
pretension
to
candour
and
impartiality
,
have
rankle
in
the
heart
of
those
author
to
such
a
degree
,
that
they
have
take
immediate
vengeance
on
the
critic
in
anonymous
libel
,
letter
,
and
lampoon
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
all
the
writer
of
the
age
,
good
,
bad
,
and
indifferent
,
from
the
moment
he
assume
this
office
,
become
his
enemy
,
either
profess
or
in
petto
,
except
those
of
his
friend
who
know
they
have
nothing
to
fear
from
his
stricture
;
and
he
must
be
a
wise
man
than
me
,
who
can
tell
what
advantage
or
satisfaction
he
derive
from
have
bring
such
a
nest
of
hornet
about
his
ear
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
I
own
,
that
be
a
point
which
may
deserve
consideration
;
but
still
I
express
a
desire
to
know
his
real
motive
for
continue
his
friendship
to
a
set
of
rascal
equally
ungrateful
and
insignificant
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
he
do
not
pretend
to
assign
any
reasonable
motive
;
that
,
if
the
truth
must
be
tell
,
the
man
be
,
in
point
of
conduct
,
a
most
incorrigible
fool
;
that
,
though
he
pretend
to
have
a
knack
at
hit
off
character
,
he
blunder
strangely
in
the
distribution
of
his
favour
,
which
be
generally
bestow
on
the
most
undeserving
of
those
who
have
recourse
to
his
assistance
;
that
,
indeed
,
this
preference
be
not
so
much
owe
to
want
of
discernment
as
to
want
of
resolution
,
for
he
have
not
fortitude
enough
to
resist
the
importunity
even
of
the
most
worthless
;
and
,
as
he
do
not
know
the
value
of
money
,
there
be
very
little
merit
in
part
with
it
so
easily
:
that
his
pride
be
gratify
in
see
himself
court
by
such
a
number
of
literary
dependant
;
that
,
probably
,
he
delight
in
hear
them
expose
and
traduce
one
another
;
and
,
finally
,
from
their
information
,
he
become
acquaint
with
all
the
transaction
of
Grub
-
street
,
which
he
have
some
thought
of
compile
,
for
the
entertainment
of
the
public
.
    
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
suspect
,
from
Dick
's
discourse
,
that
he
have
some
particular
grudge
against
S
#
#
#
#
,
upon
whose
conduct
he
have
put
the
bad
construction
it
would
bear
;
and
,
by
dint
of
cross
-
examination
<EOS>
,
I
find
he
be
not
at
all
satisfied
with
the
character
which
have
be
give
in
the
Review
of
his
last
performance
,
though
it
have
be
treat
civilly
,
in
consequence
of
the
author
's
application
to
the
critic
.
<EOS>
by
all
account
,
S
#
#
#
#
be
not
without
weakness
and
caprice
;
but
he
be
certainly
good
-
humoured
and
civilized
;
nor
do
I
find
,
that
there
be
any
thing
over
-
bear
,
cruel
,
or
implacable
in
his
disposition
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
dwell
so
long
upon
author
,
that
you
will
perhaps
suspect
I
intend
to
enroll
myself
among
the
fraternity
;
but
,
if
I
be
actually
qualified
for
the
profession
,
it
be
at
good
but
a
desperate
resource
against
starving
,
as
it
afford
no
provision
for
old
age
and
infirmity

I
think

ought
to
have

to
Miss
Laetitia
Willis

at
Gloucester
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
letty
,
there
be
something
on
my
spirit
,
which
I
should
not
venture
to
communicate
by
the
post
,
but
have
the
opportunity
of
Mrs
Brentwood
's
return
,
I
seize
it
eagerly
,
to
disburden
my
poor
heart
,
which
be
oppress
with
fear
and
vexation
.
  
<EOS>
o
Letty
!
<EOS>
what
a
miserable
situation
it
be
,
to
be
without
a
friend
to
whom
one
can
apply
for
counsel
and
consolation
in
distress
!
<EOS>
I
hint
in
my
last
,
that
one
Mr
Barton
have
be
very
particular
in
his
civility
:
<EOS>
I
can
no
longer
mistake
his
meaning
 
<EOS>
he
have
formally
profess
himself
my
admirer
;
and
,
after
a
thousand
assiduity
,
perceive
I
make
but
a
cold
return
to
his
address
,
he
have
recourse
to
the
mediation
of
lady
Griskin
,
who
have
act
the
part
of
a
very
warm
advocate
in
his
behalf
:
 
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
Willis
,
her
ladyship
overact
her
part
 
<EOS>
she
not
only
expatiate
on
the
ample
fortune
,
the
great
connexion
,
and
the
unblemished
character
of
Mr
Barton
,
but
she
take
the
trouble
to
catechise
me
;
and
,
two
day
ago
,
peremptorily
tell
me
,
that
a
girl
of
my
age
could
not
possibly
resist
so
many
consideration
,
if
her
heart
be
not
pre
-
engaged
.
    
<EOS>
this
insinuation
throw
me
into
such
a
flutter
,
that
she
could
not
but
observe
my
disorder
;
and
,
presume
upon
the
discovery
,
insist
upon
my
make
her
the
confidante
of
my
passion
.
<EOS>
but
,
although
I
have
not
such
command
of
myself
as
to
conceal
the
emotion
of
my
heart
,
I
be
not
such
a
child
as
to
disclose
its
secret
to
a
person
who
would
certainly
use
them
to
its
prejudice
.
<EOS>
I
tell
her
,
it
be
no
wonder
if
I
be
out
of
countenance
,
at
her
introduce
a
subject
of
conversation
so
unsuitable
to
my
year
and
inexperience
;
that
I
believe
Mr
Barton
be
a
very
worthy
gentleman
,
and
I
be
much
oblige
to
him
for
his
good
opinion
;
but
the
affection
be
involuntary
,
and
mine
,
in
particular
,
have
as
yet
make
no
concession
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
She
shake
her
head
with
an
air
of
distrust
that
make
me
tremble
;
and
observe
,
that
if
my
affection
be
free
,
they
would
submit
to
the
decision
of
prudence
,
especially
when
enforce
by
the
authority
of
those
who
have
a
right
to
direct
my
conduct
.
<EOS>
this
remark
imply
a
design
to
interest
my
uncle
or
my
aunt
,
perhaps
my
brother
,
in
behalf
of
Mr
Barton
's
passion
;
and
I
be
sadly
afraid
that
my
aunt
be
already
gain
over
.
<EOS>
yesterday
in
the
afternoon
,
he
have
be
walk
with
us
in
the
Park
,
and
stop
in
our
return
at
a
toyshop
,
he
present
her
with
a
very
fine
snuff
-
box
,
and
me
with
a
gold
etuis
,
which
I
resolutely
refuse
,
till
she
command
me
to
accept
it
on
pain
of
her
displeasure
:
nevertheless
,
be
still
unsatisfied
with
respect
to
the
propriety
of
receive
this
toy
,
I
signify
my
doubt
to
my
brother
,
who
say
he
would
consult
my
uncle
on
the
subject
,
and
seem
to
think
Mr
Barton
have
be
rather
premature
in
his
present
.
    
<EOS>
what
will
be
the
result
of
this
consultation
,
Heaven
know
;
but
I
be
afraid
it
will
produce
an
explanation
with
Mr
Barton
,
who
will
,
no
doubt
,
avow
his
passion
,
and
solicit
their
consent
to
a
connexion
which
my
soul
abhor
;
for
,
my
dear
Letty
,
it
be
not
in
my
power
to
love
Mr
Barton
,
even
if
my
heart
be
untouched
by
any
other
tenderness
.
<EOS>
not
that
there
be
any
thing
disagreeable
about
his
person
,
but
there
be
a
total
want
of
that
nameless
charm
whice
captivate
and
control
the
inchanted
spirit
 
<EOS>
at
least
,
he
appear
to
me
to
have
this
defect
;
but
if
he
have
all
the
engaging
qualification
which
a
man
can
possess
,
they
would
be
excite
in
vain
against
that
constancy
,
which
,
I
flatter
myself
,
be
the
characteristic
of
my
nature
.
<EOS>
no
,
my
dear
Willis
,
I
may
be
involve
in
fresh
trouble
,
and
I
believe
I
shall
,
from
the
importunity
of
this
gentleman
and
the
violence
of
my
relation
;
but
my
heart
be
incapable
of
change
.
    
<EOS>
You
know
,
I
put
no
faith
in
dream
;
and
yet
I
have
be
much
disturb
by
one
that
visit
me
last
night
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
be
in
a
church
,
where
a
certain
person
,
whom
you
know
,
be
on
the
point
of
be
married
to
my
aunt
;
that
the
clergyman
be
Mr
Barton
,
and
that
poor
forlorn
I
stand
weep
in
a
corner
,
half
naked
,
and
without
shoe
or
stocking
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
I
know
there
be
nothing
so
childish
as
to
be
move
by
those
vain
illusion
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
in
spite
of
all
my
reason
,
this
hath
make
a
strong
impression
upon
my
mind
,
which
begin
to
be
very
gloomy
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
have
another
more
substantial
cause
of
affliction
 
I
have
some
religious
scruple
,
my
dear
friend
,
which
lie
heavy
on
my
conscience
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
persuade
to
go
to
the
Tabernacle
,
where
I
hear
a
discourse
that
affect
me
deeply
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
pray
fervently
to
be
enlighten
,
but
as
yet
I
be
not
sensible
of
these
inward
motion
,
those
operation
of
grace
,
which
be
the
sign
of
a
regenerated
spirit
;
and
therefore
I
begin
to
be
in
terrible
apprehension
about
the
state
of
my
poor
soul
.
<EOS>
some
of
our
family
have
have
very
uncommon
accession
,
particularly
my
aunt
and
Mrs
Jenkins
,
who
sometimes
speak
as
if
they
be
really
inspire
;
so
that
I
be
not
like
to
want
for
either
exhortation
or

purify
my
thought

and
recall
them
from
the
vanity
of
this
world
,
which
,
indeed
,
I
would
willingly
resign
,
if
it
be
in
my
power
;
but
to
make
this
sacrifice

I
must
be

such
assistance
from
above

<EOS>
to
Sir
Watkin
Phillips
,
Bart

<EOS>
of
Jesus
college
,
Oxon
.
  
<EOS>
dear
phillips
,
<EOS>
the
moment
I
receive
your
letter
,
I
begin
to
execute
your
commission
 
with
the
assistance
of
mine
host
at
the
Bull
and
Gate
,
I
discover
the
place
to
which
your
fugitive
valet
have
retreat
,
and
tax
him
with
his
dishonesty
 
<EOS>
the
fellow
be
in
manifest
confusion
at
sight
of
me
,
but
he
deny
the
charge
with
great
confidence
,
till
I
tell
him
,
that
if
he
would
give
up
the
watch
which
be
a
family
piece
,
he
may
keep
the
money
and
the
clothe
,
and
go
to
the
devil
his
own
way
,
at
his
leisure
;
but
if
he
reject
this
proposal
,
I
would
deliver
him
forthwith
to
the
constable
,
whom
I
have
provide
for
that
purpose
,
and
he
would
carry
him
before
the
justice
without
further
delay
.
<EOS>
after
some
hesitation
,
he
desire
to
speak
with
me
in
the
next
room
,
where
he
produce
the
watch
,
with
all
its
appendage
,
and
I
have
deliver
it
to
our
landlord
,
to
be
send
you
by
the
first
safe
conveyance
 
so
much
for
business
.
    
<EOS>
I
shall
grow
vain
,
upon
your
say
you
find
entertainment
in
my
letter
;
barren
,
as
they
certainly
late
,
of
incident
and
importance
,
because
your
amusement
must
arise
,
not
from
the
matter
,
but
from
the
manner
,
which
you
know
be
all
my
own
 
animate
,
therefore
,
by
the
approbation
of
a
person
,
whose
nice
taste
and
consummate
judgment
<EOS>
I
can
no
longer
doubt
,
I
will
chearfully
proceed
with
our
memoir
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
determine
we
shall
set
out
next
week
for
Yorkshire
,
I
go
to
-
day
in
the
forenoon
with
my
uncle
to
see
a
carriage
,
belong
to
a
coachmaker
in
our
neighbourhood
 
turn
down
a
narrow
lane
,
behind
Long
-
acre
,
we
perceive
a
crowd
of
people
stand
at
a
door
;
which
,
it
seem
,
open
into
a
kind
of
a
methodist
meeting
,
and
be
inform
,
that
a
footman
be
then
hold
forth
to
the
congregation
within
.
<EOS>
curious
to
see
this
phenomenon
,
we
squeeze
into
the
place
with
much
difficulty
;
and
who
should
this
preacher
be
,
but
<EOS>
the
identical
Humphry
Clinker
.
<EOS>
He
have
finish
his
sermon
,
and
give
out
a
psalm
,
the
first
stave
of
which
he
sing
with
peculiar
grace
 
<EOS>
but
if
we
be
astonish
to
see
Clinker
in
the
pulpit
,
we
be
altogether
confound
at
find
all
the
female
of
our
family
among
the
audience
 
<EOS>
there
be
lady
Griskin
,
Mrs
Tabitha
Bramble
,
Mrs
Winifred
Jenkins
,
my
sister
Liddy
,
and
Mr
Barton
,
and
all
of
them
join
in
the
psalmody
,
with
strong
mark
of
devotion
.
    
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
keep
my
gravity
on
this
ludicrous
occasion
;
but
old
Square
-
toes
be
differently
affect
  
<EOS>
the
first
thing
that
strike
him
,
be
the
presumption
of
his
lacquey
,
whom
he
command
to
come
down
,
with
such
an
air
of
authority
as
Humphry
do
not
think
proper
to
disregard
.
<EOS>
He
descend
immediately
,
and
all
the
people
be
in
commotion
.
<EOS>
Barton
look
exceedingly
sheepish
,
lady
Griskin
flirt
her
fan
,
Mrs
Tabby
groan
in
spirit
,
Liddy
change
countenance
,
and
Mrs
Jenkins
sob
as
if
her
heart
be
break
 
My
uncle
,
with
a
sneer
,
ask
pardon
of
the
lady
,
for
have
interrupt
their
devotion
,
say
,
he
have
particular
business
with
the
preacher
,
whom
he
order
to
call
a
hackney
-
coach
.
<EOS>
this
be
immediately
bring
up
to
the
end
of
the
lane
,
he
hand
Liddy
into
it
,
and
my
aunt
and
<EOS>
I
follow
him
<EOS>
,
we
drive
home
,
without
take
any
further
notice
of
the
rest
of
the
company
,
who
still
remain
in
silent
astonishment
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Bramble
,
perceive
Liddy
in
great
trepidation
,
assume
a
milder
aspect
,
bid
her
be
under
no
concern
,
for
he
be
not
at
all
displease
at
any
thing
she
have
do
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
objection
(
say
he
)
to
your
be
religiously
inclined
;
but
I
do
not
think
my
servant
be
a
proper
ghostly
director
,
for
a
devotee
of
your
sex
and
character
  
if
,
in
fact
,
(
as
I
rather
believe
)
<EOS>
your
aunt
be
not
the
sole
conductress
of
this
machine
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Tabitha
make
no
answer
,
but
throw
up
the
white
of
her
eye
,
as
if
in
the
act
of
ejaculation
 
<EOS>
Poor
Liddy
say
she
have
no
right
to
the
title
of
a
devotee
;
that
she
think
there
be
no
harm
in
hear
a
pious
discourse
,
even
if
it
come
from
a
footman
,
especially
as
her
aunt
be
present
;
but
that
if
she
have
err
from
ignorance
,
she
hope
he
would
excuse
it
,
as
she
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
live
under
his
displeasure
.
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
,
press
her
hand
with
a
tender
smile
,
say
she
be
a
good
girl
,
and
that
he
do
not
believe
her
capable
of
do
any
thing
that
could
give
him
the
least
umbrage
or
disgust
.
    
<EOS>
when
we
arrive
at
our
lodging
,
he
command
Mr
Clinker
to
attend
him
up
stair
,
and
speak
to
him
in
these
word
 
"
since
you
be
call
upon
by
the
spirit
to
preach
and
to
teach
,
it
be
high
time
to
lay
aside
the
livery
of
an
earthly
master
;
and
,
for
my
part
,
I
be
unworthy
to
have
an
apostle
in
my
service
 
"
"
I
hope
(
say
Humphry
)
<EOS>
I
have
not
fail
in
my
duty
to
your
honour
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
a
vile
wretch
if
I
do
,
consider
the
misery
from
which
your
charity
and
compassion
relieve
me
 
but
have
an
inward
admonition
of
the
spirit
 
<EOS>

"
an
admonition
of
the
devil
 
(
cry
the
"
squire
,
in
a
passion
)
<EOS>
what
admonition
,
you
blockhead
?
  
<EOS>
what
right
have
such
a
fellow
as
you
to
set
up
for
a
reformer
?
"
<EOS>
"
beg
your
honour
's
pardon
,
(
reply
Clinker
)
may
not
the
new
light
of
God
's
grace
shine
upon
the
poor
and
the
ignorant
in
their
humility
,
as
well
as
upon
the
wealthy
,
and
the
philosopher
in
all
his
pride
of
human
learning
?
"
<EOS>
"
what
you
imagine
to
be
the
new
light
of
grace
,
(
say
his
master
)
<EOS>
I
take
to
be
a
deceitful
vapour
,
glimmer
through
a
crack
in
your
upper
story
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
Mr
Clinker
,
I
will
have
no
light
in
my
family
but
what
pay
the
king
's
taxis
,
unless
it
be
the
light
of
reason
,
which
you
do
not
pretend
to
follow
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
ah
,
sir
!
<EOS>
(
cry
Humphry
)
<EOS>
the
light
of
reason
be
no
more
,
in
comparison
to
the
light
I
mean
,
than
a
farthe
candle
to
the
sun
at
noon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
very
true
,
(
say
my
uncle
)
<EOS>
the
one
will
serve
to
shew
you
your
way
,
and
the
other
to
dazzle
and
confound
your
weak
brain
 
Hark
-
ye
,
Clinker
,
you
be
either
an
hypocritical
knave
,
or
a
wrong
-
head
enthusiast
;
and
,
in
either
case
,
unfit
for
my
service
 
<EOS>
if
you
be
a
quack
in
sanctity
and
devotion
,
you
will
find
it
an
easy
matter
to
impose
upon
silly
woman
,
and
other
of
crazed
understanding
,
who
will
contribute
lavishly
for
your
support
 
if
you
be
really
seduce
by
the
reverie
of
a
disturbed
imagination
,
the
sooner
you
lose
your
sense
entirely
,
the
well
for
yourself
and
the
community
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
,
some
charitable
person
may
provide
you
with
a
dark
room
and
clean
straw
in
Bedlam
,
where
it
would
not
be
in
your
power
to
infect
other
with
your
fanaticism
;
whereas
,
if
you
have
just
reflection
enough
leave
to
maintain
the
character
of
a
choose
vessel
in
the
meeting
of
the
godly
,
you

your
hearer
will
be
mislead
by
a
Will

i'the

wisp
,
from
one
error
into
another
,
till
you
be
plunge
into
religious
frenzy

and
then
,
perhaps
,
you
will
hang
yourself
in
despair

<EOS>
which
the
lord
of
his
infinite
mercy
forbid
!
<EOS>
(
exclaim
the
affright
Clinker

<EOS>
It
be
very
possible
<EOS>
I
may
be
under
the
temptation
of
the
devil

who
want
to
wreck
me
on
the
rock

spiritual
pride
 
<EOS>
Your
honour

,
I
be
either
a
knave
or
a
madman
;
now
,
as
I
will
assure
your
honour
I
be
no
knave

it
follow
that
I
must
be
mad
;
therefore

I
beseech
your
honour
,
upon
my
knee

to
take
my
case
into
consideration

that
mean
my
be
use
for
my
recovery
 
"
    
the
"
squire
could
not
help
smile
at
the
poor
fellow
's
simplicity
,
and
promise
to
take
care
of
him
,
provide
he
would
mind
the
business
of
his
place
,
without
run
after
the
new
light
of
methodism
:
<EOS>
but
Mrs
Tabitha
take
offence
at
his
humility
,
which
she
interpret
into
poorness
of
spirit
and
worldly
mindedness
.
  
<EOS>
She
upbraid
him
with
the
want
of
courage
to
suffer
for
conscience
sake
;
she
observe
,
that
if
he
should
lose
his
place
for
bear
testimony
to
the
truth
,
Providence
would
not
fail
to
find
him
another
,
perhaps
more
advantageous
;
and
,
declare
that
it
could
not
be
very
agreeable
to
live
in
a
family
where
an
inquisition
be
establish
,
retire
to
another
room
in
great
agitation

<EOS>
My
uncle
follow
her
with
a
significant
look
;
then
,
turn
to
the
preacher
,
"
You
hear
what
my
sister
say
.
  
<EOS>
if
you
can
not
live
with
me
upon
such
term
as
I
have
prescribe
,
the
vineyard
of
Methodism
lie
before
you

and
she
seem
very
well
disposed
to
reward
your
labour

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
willingly
give
offence
to
any
soul
upon
earth
(
answer
Humphry
)
;
her
ladyship
have
be
very
good
to
me
,
ever
since
we
come
to
London
;
and
surely
she
have
a
heart
turn
for
religious
exercise
,
and
both
she
and
lady
Griskin
sing
psalm
and
hymn
like
two
cherubim
:
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
I
be
bind
to
love
and
obey
your
honour

<EOS>
It
becometh
not
such
a
poor
ignorant
fellow
as
me
to
hold
dispute
with
gentleman
of
rank
and
learning
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
the
matter
of
knowledge
,
I
be
no
more
than
a
beast
in
comparison
of
your
honour

therefore
I
submit
,
and
,
with
God
's
grace
,
I
will
follow
you
to
the
world
's
end
,
if
you
do
not
think
me
too
far
go
to
be
out
of
confinement
.
"
    
<EOS>
His
master
promise
to
keep
him
for
some
time
longer
on
trial
;
then
desire
to
know
in
what
manner
lady
Griskin
and
Mr
Barton
come
to
join
their
religious
society
.
<EOS>
He
tell
him
,
that
her
ladyship
be
the
person
who
first
carry
my
aunt
and
sister
to
the
tabernacle
,
whither
he
attend
them
,
and
have
his
devotion
kindle
by
Mr
W
#
#
#
#
's
preaching
:
that
he
be
confirm
in
this
new
way
by
the
preacher
's
sermon
,
which
he
have
buy
and
study
with
great
attention
:
that
his
discourse
and
prayer
have
bring
over
Mrs
Jenkins
and
the
house
-
maid
to
the
same
way
of
thinking
;
but
as
for
Mr
Barton
,
he
have
never
see
him
at
service
before
this
day
,
when
he
come
in
company
with
<EOS>
lady
Griskin
 
Humphry
moreover
own
,
that
he
have
be
encourage
to
mount
the
rostrum
by
the
example
and
success
of
a
weaver
,
who
be
much
follow
as
a
powerful
minister
:
that
on
his
first
trial
,
he
find
himself
under
such
strong
impulsion
,
as
make
him
believe
he
be
certainly
move
by
the
Spirit
;
and
that
he
have
assist
in
lady
Griskin
's
,
and
several
private
house
,
at
exercise
of
devotion
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Bramble
be
no
sooner
inform
that
her
ladyship
have
act
as
the
primum
mobile
of
this
confederacy
,
than
he
conclude
she
have
only
make
use
of
Clinker
as
a
tool
,
subservient
to
the
execution
of
some
design
,
to
the
true
secret
of
which
he
be
an
utter
stranger
 
<EOS>
He
observe
,
that
her
ladyship
's
brain
be
a
perfect
mill
for
project
;
and
that
she
and
Tabby
have
certainly
engage
in
some
secret
treaty
,
the
nature
of
which
he
could
not
comprehend
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
I
think
it
be
no
difficult
matter
to
perceive
the
drift
of
Mrs
Tabitha
,
which
be
to
ensnare
the
heart
of
Barton
,
and
that
in
all
likelihood
my
lady
Griskin
act
as
her
auxiliary
:
that
this
supposition
would
account
for
their
endeavour
to
convert
him
to
Methodism
;
an
event
which
would
occasion
a
connexion
of
soul
that
may
be
easily
improve
into
a
matrimonial
union
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
seem
to
be
much
divert
by
the
thought
of
this
scheme
's
succeed
;
but
I
give
him
to
understand
that
Barton
be
pre
-
engaged
:
that
he
have
the
day
before
make
a
present
of
an
etuis
to
Liddy
,
which
her
aunt
have
oblige
her
to
receive
,
with
a
view
,
no
doubt
,
to
countenance
her
own
accepting
of
a
snuff
-
box
at
the
same
time
:
that
my
sister
have
make
me
acquaint
with
this
incident
,
I
have
desire
an
explanation
of
Mr
Barton
,
who
declare
his
intention
be
honourable
,
and
express
his
hope
that
I
would
have
no
objection
to
his
alliance
:
that
I
have
thank
him
for
the
honour
he
intend
our
family
;
but
tell
him
,
it
would
be
necessary
to
consult
her
uncle
and
aunt
,
who
be
her
guardian
,
and
their
approbation
be
obtain
,
I
could
have
no
objection
to
his
proposal
;
though
I
be
persuade
that
no
violence
would
be
offer
to
my
sister
's
inclination
,
in
a
transaction
that
so
nearly
interest
the
happiness
of
her
future
life
:
that
he
have
assure
me
,
he
should
never
think
of
avail
himself
of
a
guardian
's
authority
,
unless
he
could
render
his
address
agreeable
to
the
young
lady
herself
;
and
that
he
would
immediately
demand
permission
of
Mr
and
Miss
Bramble
to
make
Liddy
a
tender
of
his
hand
and
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
the
"
squire
be
not
insensible
to
the
advantage
of
such
a
match
,
and
declare
he
would
promote
it
with
all
his
influence
;
but
when
I
take
notice
that
there
seem
to
be
an
aversion
on
the
side
of
Liddy
,
he
say
he
would
find
her
on
the
subject
;
and
if
her
reluctance
be
such
as
would
not
be
easily
overcome
,
he
would
civilly
decline
the
proposal
of
Mr
Barton
:
for
he
think
that
,
in
the
choice
of
a
husband
,
a
young
woman
ought
not
to
sacrifice
the
feeling
of
her
heart
for
any
consideration
upon
earth
 
<EOS>
"
Liddy
be
not
so
desperate
(
say
he
)
as
to
worship
fortune
at
such
an
expence
.
<EOS>
"
I
take
it
for
grant
this
whole
affair
will
end
in
smoke
;
though
there
seem
to
be
a
storm
brew
in
the
quarter
of
Mrs
Tabby
,
who
sit
with
all
the
sullen
dignity
of
silence
at
dinner
,
seemingly
pregnant
with
complaint
and
expostulation
.
<EOS>
as
she
hath
certainly
mark
Barton
for
her
own
prey
,
she
can
not
possibly
favour
his
suit
to
Liddy
,
and
therefore
I
expect
something
extraordinary
will
attend
his
declare
himself
my
sister
's
admirer
.
<EOS>
this
declaration
will
certainly
be
make
in
form
,
as
soon
as
the
lover
can
pick
up
resolution
enough
to
stand
the
brunt
of
Mrs
Tabby
's
disappointment
;
for
he
be
,
without
doubt
,
aware
of
her
design
upon
his
person
.
  
<EOS>
the
particular
of
the
denouement
you
shall
know
in
due
season
:

<EOS>
to
Dr
Lewis

<EOS>
Dear
Lewis
,
the
deceitful
calm
be
of
short
duration
.
<EOS>
I
be
plunge
again
in
a
sea
of
vexation
,
and
the
complaint
in
my
stomach
and
bowel
be
return
;
so
that
I
suppose
I
shall
be
disable
from
prosecute
the
excursion
I
have
plan
 
what
the
devil
have
I
to
do
,
to
come
a
plague
hunting
with
a
leash
of
female
in
my
train
?
<EOS>
yesterday
my
precious
sister
(
who
by
the
bye
,
have
be
for
some
time
a
profess
Methodist
)
come
into
my
apartment
,
attend
by
Mr
Barton
,
and
desire
an
audience
with
a
very
stately
air
 
<EOS>
"
Brother
(
say
she
)
<EOS>
this
gentleman
have
something
to
propose
,
which
I
flatter
my
self
,
will
be
the
more
acceptable
,
as
it
will
rid
you
of
a
troublesome
companion
.
"
<EOS>
then
Mr
Barton
proceed
to
this
effect
 
"
I
be
,
indeed
,
extremely
ambitious
of
be
ally
to
your
family
,
Mr
Bramble
,
and
I
hope
you
will
see
no
cause
to
interpose
your
authority
.
"
<EOS>
"
as
for
authority
(
say
Tabby
,
interrupt
him
with
some
warmth
)
<EOS>
I
know
of
none
that
he
have
a
right
to
use
on
this
occasion
 
<EOS>
if
I
pay
him
the
compliment
of
make
him
acquaint
with
the
step
I
intend
to
take
,
it
be
all
he
can
expect
in
reason
 
<EOS>
this
be
as
much
as
I
believe
he
would
do
by
me
,
if
he
intend
to
change
his
own
situation
in
life
 
in
a
word
,
brother
,
I
be
so
sensible
of
Mr
Barton
's
extraordinary
merit
,
that
I
have
be
prevail
upon
to
alter
my
resolution
of
live
a
single
life
,
and
to
put
my
happiness
in
his
hand
,
by
vest
him
with
a
legal
title
to
my
person
and
fortune
,
such
as
they
be
.
<EOS>
the
business
at
present
,
be
to
have
the
writing
draw
;
and
I
shall
be
oblige
to
you
,
if
you
will
recommend
a
lawyer
to
me
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
"
    
You
may
guess
what
an
effect
this
overture
have
upon
me
,
who
,
from
the
information
of
my
nephew
,
expect
that
Barton
be
to
make
a
formal
declaration
of
his
passion
for
Liddy
;
I
could
not
help
gaze
in
silent
astonishment
,
alternately
at
Tabby
and
her
supposed
admirer
,
which
last
hang
his
head
in
the
most
aukward
confusion
for
a
few
minute
,
and
then
retire
,
on
pretence
of
be
suddenly
seize
with
a
vertigo
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
affect
much
concern
,
and
would
have
have
him
make
use
of
a
bed
in
the
house
;
but
he
insist
upon
go
home
,
that
he
may
have
recourse
to
some
drop
,
which
he
keep
for
such
emergency
,
and
his
inamorata
acquiesce
,
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
I
be
exceedingly
puzzle
at
this
adventure
(
tho
'
I
suspect
the
truth
)
and
do
not
know
in
what
manner
to
demean
myself
towards
Mrs
Tabitha
,
when
Jery
come
in
and
tell
me
,
he
have
just
see
Mr
Barton
alight
from
his
chariot
at
lady
Griskin
's
door
.
  
<EOS>
the
incident
seem
,
to
threaten
a
visit
from
her
ladyship
,
with
which
we
be
honour
accordingly
in
less
than
half
an
hour
 
<EOS>
"
I
find
(
say
she
)
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
match
of
cross
purpose
among
you
,
good
folk
;
and
I
be
come
to
set
you
to
right

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
say
,
she
present
me
with
the
folowling
billet
:
    
<EOS>
"
Dear
Sir
,
I
no
sooner
recollect
myself
from
the
extreme
confusion
I
be
throw
into
,
by
that
unlucky
mistake
of
your
sister
,
than
I
think
it
my
duty
to
assure
you
,
that
my
devoir
to
Mrs
Bramble
never
exceed
the
bound
of
ordinary
civility
,
and
that
my
heart
be
unalterably
fix
upon
Miss
Liddy
Melford
,
as
I
have
the
honour
to
declare
to
her
brother
,
when
he
question
me
upon
that
subject
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Griskin
have
be
so
good
as
to
charge
herself
,
not
only
with
the
delivery
of
this
note
,
but
also
with
the
task
of
undeceive
Mrs
Bramdle
,
for
whom
I
have
the
most
profound
respect
and
veneration
,
tho
'
<EOS>
my
affection
be
otherwise
engage
,
be
no
longer
in
the
power
of
,
Sir
,
    
"
Your
very
humble
servant
,
Ralph
Barton
.
"
    
<EOS>
have
cast
my
eye
over
this
billet
,
I
tell
her
ladyship
that
I
would
no
longer
retard
the
friendly
office
she
have
undertake
;
and
I
and
Jery
forthwith
retire
into
another
room
.
<EOS>
there
we
soon
perceive
the
conversation
grow
very
warm
betwixt
the
two
lady
;
and
,
at
length
,
could
distinctly
hear
certain
term
of
altercation
,
which
we
could
no
longer
delay
interrupting
,
with
any
regard
to
decorum
.
<EOS>
when
we
enter
the
scene
of
contention
,
we
find
Liddy
have
join
the
disputant
,
and
stand
tremble
betwixt
them
,
as
be
if
she
have
be
afraid
they
would
have
proceed
to
something
more
practicable
than
word
 
<EOS>
Lady
Griskin
's
face
be
like
the
full
moon
in
a
storm
of
wind
,
glaring
,
fiery
,
and
portentous
;
while
Tabby
look
grim
and
ghastly
,
with
an
aspect
breathing
discord
and
dismay
.
  
<EOS>
Our
appearance
put
a
stop
to
their
mutual
reviling
;
but
her
ladyship
turn
to
me
,
"
Cousin
(
say
she
)
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
say
I
have
meet
with
a
very
ungrateful
return
from
this
lady
,
for
the
pain
I
have
take
to
serve
her
family
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
family
be
much
oblige
to
your
ladyship
,
(
cry
Tabby
,
with
a
kind
of
hysterical
giggle
)
but
we
have
no
right
to
the
good
office
of
such
an
honourable
go
-
between
.
"
<EOS>
"
but
,
for
all
that
,
good
Mrs
Tabitha
Bramble
,
(
resume
the
other
)
<EOS>
I
shall
be
content
with
the
reflection
,
that
virtue
be
its
own
reward
;
and
it
shall
not
be
my
fault
if
you
continue
to
make
yourself
ridiculous
  
<EOS>
Mr
Bramble
,
who
have
no
little
interest
of
his
own
to
serve
,
will
no
doubt
,
contribute
all
in
his
power
to
promote
a
match
betwixt
Mr
Barton
and
his
niece
,
which
will
be
equally
honourable
and
advantageous
;
and
,
I
dare
say
,
Miss
Liddy
herself
will
have
no
objection
to
a
measure
so
well
calculated
to
make
her
happy
in
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
ladyship
's
pardon
,
(
exclaim
Liddy
,
with
great
vivacity
)
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
but
misery
to
expect
from
such
a
measure
;
and
I
hope
my
guardian
will
have
too
much
compassion
,
to
barter
my
peace
of
mind
for
any
consideration
of
interest
or
fortune

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
Miss
Liddy
!
<EOS>
(
say
she
)
<EOS>
you
have
profit
by
the
example
of
your
good
aunt
 
<EOS>
I
comprehend
your
meaning
,
and
will
explain
it
when
I
have
a
proper
opportunity
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
I
shall
take
my
leave

your
most
obedient
,

devote
humble
servant

say
she

advance
close
up
to
my
sister
,
and
curtsy
so
low
,
that
I
think
she
intend
to
squat
herself
down
on
the
floor
 
<EOS>
this
salutation
Tabby
return
with
equal
solemnity
;
and
the
expression
of
the
two
face
,
while
they
continue
in
this
attitude
,
would
be
no
bad
subject
for
a
pencil
like
that
of
the
incomparable
Hogarth
,
if
any
such
should
ever
appear
again
,
in
these
time
of
dullness
and
degeneracy

<EOS>
Jery
accompany
her
ladyship
to
her
house
,
that
he
may
have
an
opportunity
to
restore
the
etuis
to
Barton
,
and
advise
him
to
give
up
his
suit
,
which
be
so
disagreeable
to
his
sister
,
against
whom
,
however
,
he
return
much
irritated
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Griskn
have
assure
him
,
that
Liddy
's
heart
be
pre
-
occupied
;
and
immediately
the
idea
of
Wilson
recur
to
his
imagination
,
his
family
-
pride
,
take
the
alarm
 
<EOS>
He
denounce
vengeance
against
that
adventurer
,
and
be
dispose
to
be
very
peremptory
with
his
sister
;
but
I
desire
he
would
suppress
his
resentment
,
until
I
should
have
talk
with
her
in
private
.
    
<EOS>
the
poor
girl
,
when
I
earnestly
press
her
on
this
head
,
own
,
with
a
flood
of
tear
,
that
Wilson
have
actually
come
to
the
Hot
Well
at
Bristol
,
and
even
introduce
himself
into
our
lodging
as
a
Jew
pedler
;
but
that
nothing
have
pass
betwixt
them
,
further
than
her
beg
him
to
withdraw
immediately
,
if
he
have
any
regard
for
her
peace
of
mind
:
that
he
have
disappear
accordingly
,
after
have
attempt
to
prevail
upon
my
sister
's
maid
to
deliver
a
letter
;
which
,
however
,
she
refuse
to
receive
,
though
she
have
consent
to
carry
a
message
,
import
that
he
be
a
gentleman
of
a
good
family
,
and
that
in
a
very
little
time
,
he
would
avow
his
passion
in
that
character
 
<EOS>
She
confess
,
that
although
he
have
not
keep
his
word
in
this
particular
,
he
be
not
yet
altogether
indifferent
to
her
affection
;
but
solemnly
promise
,
she
would
never
carry
on
any
correspondence
with
him
,
or
any
other
admirer
,
for
the
future
,
without
the
privity
and
approbation
of
her
brother
and
me

<EOS>
by
this
declaration
,
she
make
her
own
peace
with
Jery
;
but
the
hot
-
head
boy
be
more
than
ever
incense
against
Wilson
,
whom
he
now
consider
as
an
impostor
,
that
harbour
some
infamous
design
upon
the
honour
of
his
family
 
<EOS>
as
for
Barton
,
he
be
not
a
little
mortify
to
find
his
present
return
,
and
his
address
so
unfavourably
receive
;
but
he
be
not
a
man
to
be
deeply
affect
by
such
disappointment
;
and
I
know
not
whether
he
be
not
as
well
pleased
at
be
discard
by
Liddy
,
as
he
would
have
be
with
a
permission
to
prosecute
his
pretension
,
at
the
risque
of
be
every
day
expose
to
the
revenge
or
machination
of
Tabby
,
who
be
not
to
be
slight
with
impunity
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
much
time
to
moralize
on
these
occurrence
;
for
the
house
be
visit
by
a
constable
and
his
gang
with
a
warrant
from
justice
Buzzard
,
to
search
the
box
of
Humphry
Clinker
,
my
footman
,
who
be
just
apprehend
as
a
highwayman
 
<EOS>
this
incident
throw
the
whole
family
into
confusion
.
<EOS>
My
sister
scold
the
constable
for
presume
to
enter
the
lodging
of
a
gentleman
on
such
an
errand
,
without
have
first
ask
and
obtain
permission
;
her
maid
be
frighten
into
sit
,
and
Liddy
shed
tear
of
compassion
for
the
unfortunate
Clinker
,
in
whose
box
,
however
,
nothing
be
find
to
confirm
the
suspicion
of
robbery
    
for
my
own
part
,
I
make
no
doubt
of
the
fellow
's
be
mistake
for
some
other
person
,
and
I
go
directly
to
the
justice
,
in
order
to
procure
his
discharge
;
but
there
I
find
the
matter
much
more
serious
than
I
expect
 
<EOS>
Poor
Clinker
stand
tremble
at
the
bar
,
surround
by
thief
-
taker
;
and
,
at
a
little
distance
,
a
thick
,
squat
fellow
,
a
postillion
,
his
accuser
,
who
have
seize
him
in
the
street
,
and
swear
positively
to
his
person
,
that
the
say
Clinker
have
,
on
the
15th
day
of
March
last
,
on
Blackheath
,
rob
a
gentleman
in
a
postchaise
,
which
he
(
the
postillion
drive
)
 
<EOS>
this
deposition
be
sufficient
to
justify
his
commitment
;
and
he
be
send
accordingly
to
Clerkenwell
prison
,
whither
Jery
accompany
him
in
the
coach
,
in
order
to
recommend
him
properly
to
the
keeper
,
that
he
may
want
for
no
convenience
which
the
place
afford
.
    
<EOS>
the
spectator
,
who
assemble
to
see
this
highwayman
,
be
sagacious
enough
to
discern
something
very
villanous
in
his
aspect
,
which
(
beg
their
pardon
)
be
the
very
picture
of
simplicity
;
and
the
justice
himself
put
a
very
unfavourable
construction
upon
some
of
his
answer
which
,
he
say
,
favour
of
the
ambiguity
and
equivocation
of
an
old
offender
;
but
,
in
my
opinion
,
it
would
have
be
more
just
and
humane
to
impute
them
to
the
confusion
into
which
we
may
suppose
a
poor
country
lad
to
be
throw
on
such
an
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
be
still
persuade
he
be
innocent
;
and
in
this
persuasion
,
I
can
do
no
less
than
use
my
utmost
endeavour
that
he
may
not
be
oppress
 
<EOS>
I
shall
,
to
-

send
my
nephew
to
wait
on
the
gentleman
who
be
rob
,
and
beg
he
will
have
the
humanity
to
go
and
see
the
prisoner
;
that
in
case
he
should
find
him
quite
different
from
the
person
of
the
highwayman
,
he
may
bear
testimony
in
his
behalf
  
Howsoever
<EOS>
it
may
fare
with
Clinker
,
this
curse
affair
will
be
to
me
productive
of
intolerable
chagrin
 
<EOS>
I
have
already
catch
a
dreadful
cold
,
by
rush
into
the
open
air
from
the
justice
's
parlour
,
where
I
have
be
stew
in
the
crowd

and
tho

I
should
not
be
lay
up
with
the
gout
,
as
I
believe
I
shall
<EOS>
,
I
must
stay
at
London
for
some
week
,
till
this
poor
devil
come
to
his
trial
at
Rochester
;
so
that
,
in
all
probability
,
my
northern
expedition
be
blow
up
.
    
<EOS>
if
you
can
find
any

in
your

budget

to
console
me
in
the

of

Oxon
  
dear
WAT
,
the
farce
be
finish
,
and
another
piece
of
a
graver
cast
bring
upon
the
stage
.
  
<EOS>
Our
aunt
make
a
desperate
attack
upon
Barton
,
who
have
no
other
way
of
save
himself
,
but
by
leave
her
in
possession
of
the
field
,
and
avow
his
pretension
to
Liddy
,
by
whom
he
have
be
reject
in
his
turn
.
<EOS>
Lady
Griskin
act
as
his
advocate
and
agent
on
this
occasion
,
with
such
zeal
as
embroil
her
with
Mrs
Tabitha
,
and
a
high
scene
of
altercation
pass
betwixt
<EOS>
these
two
religionist
,
which
may
have
come
to
action
,
have
not
my
uncle
interpose
.
<EOS>
They
be
,
however
,
reconcile
,
in
consequence
of
an
event
which
hath
involve
us
all
in
trouble
and
disquiet
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
the
poor
preacher
,
Humphry
Clinker
,
be
now
exercise
his
ministry
among
the
felon
in
Clerkenwell
prison
.
  
<EOS>
a
postillion
have
swear
a
robbery
against
him
,
no
bail
could
be
take
,
and
he
be
commit
to
goal
,
notwithstanding
all
the
remonstrance
and
interest
my
uncle
could
make
in
his
behalf
.
    
<EOS>
all
thing
consider
,
the
poor
fellow
can
not
possibly
be
guilty
,
and
<EOS>
yet
,
I
believe
,
he
run
some
risque
of
be
hang
.
  
<EOS>
upon
his
examination
,
he
answer
with
such
hesitation
and
reserve
,
as
persuade
most
of
the
people
,
who
crowd
the
place
,
that
he
be
really
a
knave
,
and
the
justice
's
remark
confirm
their
opinion
.
<EOS>
exclusive
of
my
uncle
and
myself
,
there
be
only
one
person
who
seem
inclined
to
favour
the
culprit
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
young
man
,
well
dressed
,
and
from
the
manner
in
which
he
cross
-
examine
the
evidence
,
we
take
it
for
grant
,
that
he
be
a
student
in
one
of
the
inn
of
court
 
<EOS>
He
freely
check
the
justice
for
some
uncharitable
inference
he
make
to
the
prejudice
of
the
prisoner
,
and
even
venture
to
dispute
with
his
worship
on
certain
point
of
law
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
provoke
at
the
unconnected
and
dubious
answer
of
Clinker
,
who
seem
in
danger
of
fall
a
sacrifice
to
his
own
simplicity
,
exclaim
,
"
in
the
name
of
God
,
if
you
be
innocent
,
say
so
.
"
<EOS>
"
no
(
cry
he
)
<EOS>
God
forbid
that
I
should
call
myself
innocent
,
while
my
conscience
be
burden
with
sin
.
"
<EOS>
"
what
then
,
you
do
commit
this
robbery
?
"
resume
his
master
,
"
"
<EOS>
no
,
sure
(
say
he
)
bless
<EOS>
be
the
Lord
<EOS>
,
I
be
free
of
that
guilt
.
"
    
<EOS>
here
the
justice
interpose
,
observe
,
that
the
man
seem
inclined
to
make
a
discovery
by
turn
king
's
evidence
,
and
desire
the
clerk
to
take
his
confession
;
upon
which
Humphry
declare
,
that
he
look
upon
confession
to
be
a
popish
fraud
,
invent
by
the
whore
of
Babylon
.
<EOS>
the
Templar
,
affirm
,
that
the
poor
fellow
be
non
compos
;
and
exhort
the
justice
to
discharge
him
as
a
lunatic
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
very
well
(
add
he
)
that
the
robbery
in
question
be
not
commit
by
the
prisoner
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
thief
-
taker
grin
at
one
another
;
and
Mr
Justice
Buzzard
reply
with
great
emotion
,
<EOS>
"
Mr
Martin
,
I
desire
you
will
mind
your
own
business
;
I
shall
convince
you
one
of
these
day
that
I
understand
mine
.
<EOS>
"
in
short
,
there
be
no
remedy
;
the
mittimus
be
make
out
,
and
poor
Clinker
send
to
prison
in
a
hackney
-
coach
,
guard
by
the
constable
,
and
accompany
by
your
humble
servant
.
<EOS>
by
the
way
,
I
be
not
a
little
surprised
to
hear
this
retainer
to
justice
bid
the
prisoner
to
keep
up
his
spirit
,
for
that
he
do
not
at
all
doubt
,
but
that
he
would
get
off
for
a
few
week
confinement
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
his
worship
know
very
well
that
Clinker
be
innocent
of
the
fact
,
and
that
the
real
highwayman
,
who
rob
the
chaise
,
be
no
other
than
that
very
individual
Mr
Martin
,
who
have
plead
so
strenuously
for
honest
Humphry
.
    
<EOS>
confound
at
this
information
,
I
ask
,
"
why
then
be
he
suffer
to
go
about
at
his
liberty
,
and
this
poor
innocent
fellow
treat
as
a
malefactor
?
"
<EOS>
"
We
have
exact
intelligence
of
all
Mr
Martin
's
transaction
;
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
but
as
yet
there
be
no
evidence
sufficient
for
his
conviction
;
and
as
for
this
young
man
,
the
justice
could
do
no
less
than
commit
him
,
as
the
postillion
swear
point
-
blank
to
his
identity
.
"
<EOS>
"
so
if
this
rascally
postillion
should
persist
in
the
falsity
to
which
he
be
swear
,
(
say
I
)
<EOS>
this
innocent
lad
may
be
bring
to
the
gallow
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
constable
observe
,
that
he
would
have
time
enough
to
prepare
for
his
trial
,
and
may
prove
an
alibi
;
or
perhaps
,
Martin
may
be
apprehend
and
convict
for
another
fact
;
in
which
case
,
he
may
be
prevail
upon
to
take
this
affair
upon
himself
;
or
finally
,
if
these
chance
should
fail
,
and
the
evidence
stand
good
against
Clinker
,
the
jury
may
recommend
him
to
mercy
,
in
consideration
of
his
youth
,
especially
if
this
should
appear
to
be
the
first
fact
of
which
he
have
be
guilty
.
    
<EOS>
Humphry
own
he
could
not
pretend
to
recollect
where
he
have
be
on
the
day
when
the
robbery
be
commit
,
much
less
prove
a
circumstance
of
that
kind
so
far
back
as
six
month
,
though
he
know
he
have
be
sick
of
the
fever
and
ague
,
which
,
however
,
do
not
prevent
him
from
go
about
 
then
,
turn
up
his
eye
,
he
ejaculate
,
"
the
Lord
's
will
be
do
!
<EOS>
if
it
be
my
fate
to
suffer
,
I
hope
I
shall
not
disgrace
the
faith
,
of
which
,
though
unworthy
,
I
make
profession
.
"
    
<EOS>
when
I
express
my
surprize
,
that
the
accuser
should
persist
in
charge
Clinker
,
without
take
the
least
notice
of
the
real
robber
,
who
stand
before
him
,
and
to
whom
,
indeed
,
Humphry
bear
not
the
small
resemblance
;
the
constable
(
who
be
himself
a
thief
-
taker
)
give
me
to
understand
,
that
Mr
Martin
be
the
best
qualified
for
business
of
all
the
gentleman
on
the
road
he
have
ever
know
;
that
he
always
act
on
his
own
bottom
,
without
partner
or
correspondent
,
and
never
go
to
work
,
but
when
he
be
cool
and
sober
;
that
his
courage
and
presence
of
mind
never
fail
him
;
that
his
address
be
genteel
,
and
his
behaviour
void
of
all
cruelty
and
insolence
;
that
he
never
encumber
himself
with
watch
or
trinket
,
nor
even
with
bank
-
note
,
but
always
deal
for
ready
money
,
and
that
in
the
current
coin
of
the
kingdom
;
and
that
he
could
disguise
himself
and
his
horse
in
such
a
manner
,
that
,
after
the
action
,
it
be
impossible
to
recognize
either
the
one
or
the
other
 
"
this
great
man
(
say
he
)
have
reign
paramount
in
all
the
road
within
fifty
mile
of
London
above
fifteen
month
,
and
have
do
more
business
in
that
time
,
than
all
the
rest
of
the
profession
put
together
;
for
those
who
pass
through
his
hand
,
be
so
delicately
deal
with
,
that
they
have
no
desire
to
give
him
the
least
disturbance
;
but
for
all
that
,
his
race
be
almost
run
 
he
be
now
flutter
about
justice
,
like
a
moth
about
a
candle
 
there
be
so
many
lime
-
twig
lay
in
his
way

that
I
will
bet
a
cool
hundred
,
he
swing
before
Christmas

"
    
<EOS>
Shall
I
own
to
you
,
that
this
portrait
,
draw
by
a
ruffian
,
heighten
by
what
I
myself
have
observe
in
his
deportment
,
have
interest
me
warmly
in
the
fate
of
poor
Martin
,
whom
nature
seem
to
have
intend
for
a
useful
and
honourable
member
of
that
community
upon
which
he
now
prey
for
subsistence
?
<EOS>
It
seem
he
live
some
time
as
a
clerk
to
a
tember
merchant
,
whose
daughter
Martin
have
privately
marry
,
be
discard
,
and
his
wife
turn
out
of
door
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
long
survive
her
marriage
;
and
Martin
,
turn
fortune
-
hunter
,
could
not
supply
his
occasion
any
other
way
,
than
by
take
to
the
road
,
in
which
he
have
travel
hitherto
with
uncommon
success
.
  
<EOS>
He
pay
his
respect
regularly
to
Mr
Justice
Buzzard
,
the
thief
-
catcher
-
general
of
this
metropolis
,
and
sometimes
they
smoke
a
pipe
together
very
lovingly
,
when
the
conversation
generally
turn
upon
the
nature
of
evidence
.
  
<EOS>
the
justice
have
give
him
fair
warning
to
take
care
of
himself
,
and
he
have
receive
his
caution
in
good
part
.
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
he
have
baffle
all
the
vigilance
,
art
,
and
activity
of
Buzzard
and
his
emissary
,
with
such
conduct
as
would
have
do
honour
to
the
genius
of
a
Caesar
or
a
Turenne
;
but
he
have
one
weakness
which
have
prove
fatal
to
all
the
hero
of
his
tribe
,
namely
,
an
indiscreet
devotion
to
the
fair
sex
,
and
in
all
probability
,
he
will
be
attack
on
this
defenceless
quarter
.
    
<EOS>
be
that
as
it
may
,
I
see
the
body
of
poor
Clinker
consign
to
the
gaoler
of
Clerkenwell
,
to
whose
indulgence
I
recommend
him
so
effectually
,
that
he
receive
him
in
the
most
hospitable
manner
,
though
there
be
a
necessity
for
equip
him
with
a
suit
of
iron
,
in
which
he
make
a
very
rueful
appearance
.
<EOS>
the
poor
creature
seem
as
much
affect
by
my
uncle
's
kindness
,
as
by
his
own
misfortune
.
<EOS>
when
I
assure
him
,
that
nothing
should
be
leave
undone
for
procure
his
enlargment
,
and
make
his
confinement
easy
in
the
mean
time
,
he
fall
down
on
his
knee
,
and
kiss
my
hand
,
which
he
bathe
with
his
tear
,
"

cry
he

shall
I
say

<EOS>
I
can
not
 
no

I
protest
,
the
scene
become
so
pathetic

that
I
be
fain
to
force
myself
away
,

return
to
my
uncle

who
send
me
in
the
afternoon
with
a
compliment
to
one
Mr
Mead
,
the
person
who
have
be
rob
on
Black

heath

<EOS>
as
I
do
not
find
him
at
home
,
I
leave
a
message
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
call
at
our
lodging
this
morning
,
and
very
humanely
agree
to
visit
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
lady
Criskin
have
come
to
make
her
formal
compliment
of
condolance
to
Mrs
Tabitha
,
on
this
domestic
calamity
;
and
that
prudent
maiden
,
whose
passion
be
now
cool
,
think
proper
to
receive
her
ladyship
so
civilly
,
that
a
reconciliation
immediately
ensue

these
two

resolve
to
comfort
the
poor

slight
complaint
in

stomach

the
turnkey
,
who
receive
us
at
Clerkenwell

look
remarkably
sullen
;

when
we
enquire
for
Clinker
,
"
I
do
not
care
if
the
devil
have
him
;

say
he

in

we
find
that
Humphry
be

at
that
very

<EOS>
Mr
Mead
,
have
earnestly
survey
the
preacher
,
declare
his
appearance
be
so
different
from
that
of
the
person
who
rob
him
on
Black
-
heath
,
that
he
could
freely
make
oath
he
be
not
the
man
:
<EOS>
but
Humphry
himself
be
by
this
time
pretty
well
rid
of
all
apprehension
of
be
hang
;
for
he
have
be
the
night
<EOS>
before
solemnly
try
and
acquit
by
his
fellow
prisoner
,
some
of
whom
he
have
already
convert
to
methodism
.
<EOS>
He
now
make
proper
acknowledgment
for
the
honour
of
our
visit
,
and
be
permit
to
kiss
the
hand
of
the
lady
,
who
assure
him
,
he
may
depend
upon
their
friendship
and
protection
.
<EOS>
Lady
Griskin
,
in
her
great
zeal
,
exhort
his
fellow
-
prisoner
to
profit
by
the
precious
opportunity
of
have
such
a
saint
in
bond
among
them
,
and
turn
over
a
new
leaf
for
the
benefit
of
their
poor
soul
;
and
,
that
her
admonition
may
have
the
great
effect
,
she
reinforce
it
with
her
bounty
.
    
<EOS>
while
she
and
Mrs
Tabby
return
in
the
coach
with
the
two
maid
-
servant
,
I
wait
on
Mr
Mead
to
the
house
of
justice
Buzzard
,
who
,
have
hear
his
declaration
,
say
his
oath
could
be
of
no
use
at
present
,
but
that
he
would
be
a
material
evidence
for
the
prisoner
at
his
trial
;
so
that
there
seem
to
be
no
remedy
but
patience
for
poor
Clinker
;
and
,
indeed
,
the
same
virtue
,
or
medicine
,
will
be
necessary
for
us
all
,
the
"
squire
in
particular
,
who
have
set
his
heart
upon
his
excursion
to
the
northward
.
    
<EOS>
while
we
be
visit
honest
Humphry
in
Clerkenwell
prison
,
my
uncle
receive
a
much
more
extraordinary
visit
at
his
own
lodging
.
<EOS>
Mr
Martin
,
of
whom
I
have
make
such
honourable
mention
,
desire
permission
to
pay
him
his
respect
,
and
be
admit
accordingly
.
<EOS>
He
tell
him
,
that
have
observe
him
,
at
Mr
Buzzard
's
,
a
good
deal
disturb
by
what
have
happen
to
his
servant
,
he
have
come
to
assure
him
he
have
nothing
to
apprehend
for
Clinker
's
life
;
for
if
it
be
possible
that
any
jury
could
find
him
guilty
upon
such
evidence
,
he
,
Martin
himself
,
would
produce
in
court
a
person
,
whose
deposition
would
bring
him
off
clear
as
the
sun
at
noon
.
  
<EOS>
sure
,
the
fellow
would
not
be
so
romantic
as
to
take
the
robbery
upon
himself
!
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
the
postillion
be
an
infamous
fellow
,
who
have
be
a
dabbler
in
the
same
profession
,
and
save
his
life
at
the
Old
Bailey
by
impeach
his
companion
;
that
be
now
reduce
to
great
poverty
,
he
have
make
this
desperate
push
,
to
swear
away
the
life
of
an
innocent
man
,
in
hope
of
have
the
reward
upon
his
conviction
;
but
that
he
would
find
himself
miserably
disappointed
,
for
the
justice
and
his
myrmidon
be
determine
to
admit
of
no
interloper
in
this
branch
of
business
;
and
that
he
do
not
at
all
doubt
but
that
they
would
find
matter
enough
to
shop
the
evidence
himself
before
the
next
gaol
delivery
.
<EOS>
He
affirm
,
that
all
these
circumstance
be
well
known
to
the
justice
;
and
that
his
severity
to
Clinker
be
no
other
than
a
hint
to
his
master
to
make
him
a
present
in
private
,
as
an
acknowledgment
of
his
candour
and
humanity
.
    
<EOS>
this
hint
,
however
,
be
so
unpalatable
to
Mr
Bramble
,
that
he
declare
,
with
great
warmth
he
would
rather
confine
himself
for
life
to
London
'
which
he
detest
,
than
be
at
liberty
to
leave
it
to
-
morrow
,
in
consequence
of
encourage
corruption
in
a
magistrate
.
<EOS>
hearing
,
however
,
how
favourable
Mr
Mead
's
report
have
be
for
the
prisoner
,
he
be
resolve
to
take
the
advice
of
counsel
in
what
manner
to
proceed
for
his
immediate
enlargement
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
doubt
,
but
that
in
a
day
or
two
this
troublesome
business
may
be
discuss
;
and
in
this
hope
we
be
prepare
for
our
journey
.
<EOS>
if
our
endeavour
do
not
miscarry

in

a
lucky
incident

<EOS>
the

on

and
commit
on

<EOS>
clinker

have
move
for
a
writ

,
be
bring
before
the
lord
chief
justice
,
who
,
in
consequence
of
an
affidavit
of
the
gentleman
who
have
be
rob
,
import
that
the
say
Clinker
be
not
the
person
who
stop
him
on
the
highway
,
as
well
as
in
consideration
of
the
postillion
's
character
and
present
circumstance
,
be
pleased
to
order
,
that
my
servant
should
be
admit
to
bail
,
and
he
have
be
discharge
accordingly
,
to
the
unspeakable
satisfaction
of
our
whole
family
,
to
which
he
have
recommend
himself
in
an
extraordinary
manner
,
not
only
by
his
oblige
deportment
,
but
by
his
talent
of
preaching
,
pray
,
and
singe
psalm
,
which
he
have
exercise
with
such
effect
,
that
even
Tabby
respect
him
as
a
choose
vessel
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
any
thing
like
affectation
or
hypocrisy
in
this
excess
of
religion
,
I
would
not
keep
him
in
my
service
;
but
,
so
far
as
I
can
observe
,
the
fellow
's
character
be
downright
simplicity
,
warm
with
a
kind
of
enthusiasm
,
which
render
him
very
susceptible
of
gratitude
and
attachment
to
his
benefactor
.
    
<EOS>
as
he
be
an
excellent
horseman
,
and
understand
farriery
,
I
have
buy
a
stout
gelding
for
his
use
,
that
he
may
attend
us
on
the
road
,
and
have
an
eye
to
our
cattle
,
in
case
the
coachman
should
not
mind
his
business
.
<EOS>
My
nephew
,
who
be
to
ride
his
own
saddle
horse
,
have
take
,
upon
trial
,
a
servant
just
come
from
abroad
with
his
former
master
,
sir
William
Strollop
,
who
vouch
for
his
honesty
.
<EOS>
the
fellow
,
whose
name
be
Dutton
,
seem
to
be
a
petit
-
maitre
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
get
a
smattering
of
French
,
bow
,
and
grin
,
and
shrug
,
and
take
snuff
a
la
mode
de

,
but
value
himself
chiefly
upon
his
skill
and
dexterity
in
hair
-
dressing
 
<EOS>
if
I
be
not
much
deceive
by
appearance
,
he
be
,
in
all
respect
,
the
very
contrast
of
Humphry
Clinker
.
    
<EOS>
My
sister
have
make
up
matter
with
lady
Griskin
;
though
,
I
must
own
,
I
should
not
have
be
sorry
to
see
that
connexion
entirely
destroy
:
but
Tabby
be
not
of
a
disposition
to
forgive
Barton
,
who
,
I
understand
,
be
go
to
his
seat
in
Berkshire
for
the
summer
season
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
suspect
,
that
in
the
treaty
of
peace
,
which
have
be
lately
ratify
betwixt
<EOS>
those
two
female
,
it
be
stipulate
,
that
her
ladyship
shall
use
her
good
endeavour
to
provide
an
agreeable
help
mate
for
our
sister
Tabitha
,
who
seem
to
be
quite
desperate
in
her
matrimonial
design
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
the
match
-
maker
be
to
have
a
valuable
consideration
in
the
way
of
brokerage
,
which
she
will
most
certainly
deserve
,
if
she
can
find
any
man
in
his
sense
,
who
will
yoke
with
Mrs
Bramble
from
motive
of
affection
or
interest
.
    
<EOS>
I
find
my
spirit
and
my
health
affect
each
other
reciprocally
 
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
,
every
thing
that
discompose
my
mind
,
produce
a
correspondent
disorder
in
my
body
;
and
my
bodily
complaint
be
remarkably
mitigate
by
those
consideration
that
dissipate
the
cloud
of
mental
chagrin
 
<EOS>
the
imprisonment
of
Clinker
bring
on
those
symptom
which
I
mention
in
my
last
,
and
now
they
be
vanish
at
his
discharge
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
own
,
indeed
,
I
take
some
of
the
tincture
of
ginseng
,
prepare
accord
to
your
prescription
,
and
find
it
exceedingly
grateful
to
the
stomach
;
but
the
pain
and
sickness
continue
to
return
,
after
short
interval
,
till
the
anxiety
of
my
mind
be
entirely
remove
,
and
then
I
find
myself
perfectly
at
ease
.
<EOS>
We
have
have
fair
weather
these
ten
day

to
the
astonishment
of
the
Londoners

who
think
it
portentous

I

get

I

I
desire
you

redouble
your

and
circumflexion

that
the

well
mange
in
our
absence

for

you
know

you

render
account

not
only
to
your
earthly
master

but
also
to
him
that

and
if
you

great

I

and
that
the

will
fetch
me
a
good

before

as
the

<EOS>
I
write
to

but
he
never

the
good
manner

take
the

for
which
reason

I
shall
never

him

You

do
well
to
keep
a
watchfull

over

no

<EOS>
God
forbid
that
I

lack
christian

charity

sure
nothing
can
be
a
more
charitable
work
than
to
rid
the

of
such
vermine

<EOS>
I
do
suppose

that

<EOS>
if
I

I

He

He

but
Martin

who

advance
to

beg
the

would
compose
themselves
for
a
moment
;
then
,
desire
Clinker
to
follow
him
to
the
charge
,
he
pull
a
pistol
out
of
his
bosom
,
and
they
ride
up
together
to
give
battle
to
the
rogue
,
who
,
have
fire
at
a
great
distance
,
flee
across

<EOS>
They
be
in
pursuit
of
the
fugitive
when
I
come
up
,
not
a
little
alarm
at
the
shriek
in
the
coach
,
where
I
find
my
uncle
in
a
violent
rage
,
without
his
periwig
,
struggle
to
disentangle
himself
from
Tabby
and
the
other
two
,
and
swear
with
great
vociferation
.
<EOS>
before
I
have
time
to
interpose
,
Martin
and
Clinker
return
from
the
pursuit
,
and
the
former
pay
his
compliment
with
great
politeness
,
give
us
to
understand
,
that
the
fellow
have
scamper
off
,
and
that
he
believe
they
be
a
couple
of
raw
"
prentice
from
London
.
<EOS>
He
commend
Clinker
for
his
courage
,
and
say
,
if
he
would
give
him
leave
,
he
would
have
the
honour
to
accompany
us
as
far
as
Stevenage
,
where
he
have
some
business
.
    
<EOS>
the
"
squire
,
have
recollect
and
adjust
himself
,
be
the
first
to
laugh
at
his
own
situation
;
;
but
it
be
not
without
difficulty
,
that
Tabby
's
arm
could
be
untwisted
from
his
neck
,
Liddy
's
tooth
chatter
,
and
Jenkins
be
threaten
with
a
fit
as
usual
.
<EOS>
I
have
communicate
to
my
uncle
the
character
of
Martin
,
as
it
be
describe
by
the
constable
,
and
he
be
much
strike
with
its
singularity
  
<EOS>
He
could
not
suppose
the
fellow
have
any
design
on
our
company
,
which
be
so
numerous
and
well
armed
;
he
therefore
thank
him
for
the
service
he
have
just
do
them
,
say
he
would
be
glad
of
his
company
,
and
ask
him
to
dine
with
us
at
Hatfield
.
<EOS>
this
invitation
may
not
have
be
agreeable
to
the
lady
,
have
they
know
the
real
profession
of
our
guest
,
but
this
be
a
secret
to
all
,
except
my
uncle
and
myself
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
<EOS>
however
,
would
by
no
means
consent
to
proceed
with
a
case
of
loaded
pistol
in
the
coach
,
and
they
be
forthwith
discharge
in
complaisance
to
her
and
the
rest
of
the
woman
.
    
<EOS>
be
gratify
in
this
particular
,
she
become
remarkably
good
-
humoured
,
and
at
dinner
behave
in
the
most
affable
manner
to
Mr
Martin
,
with
whose
polite
address
and
agreeable
conversation
she
seem
to
be
much
take
.
<EOS>
after
dinner
,
the
landlord
accost
me
in
the
yard
,
ask
,
with
a
significant
look
,
if
the
gentleman
that
ride
the
sorrel
belong
to
our
company
?
  
<EOS>
I
understand
his
meaning
,
but
answer
no
;
that
he
have
come
up
with
us
on
the
common
,
and
help
us
to
drive
away
two
fellow
,
that
look
like
highwayman
 
<EOS>
He
nod
three
time
distinctly
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
he
know
his
cue
.
<EOS>
then
he
inquire
,
if
one
of
those
man
be
mount
on
a
bay
mare
,
and
the
other
on
a
chesnut
geld
with
a
white
streak
down
his
forehead
?
and
be
answer
in
the
affirmative
,
he
assure
me
,
they
have
rob
three
post
-
chaise
<EOS>
this
very
morning
 
<EOS>
I
inquire
,
in
my
turn
,
if
Mr
Martin
be
of
his
acquaintance
?
<EOS>
and
,
nod
thrice
again
,
he
answer
,
that
he
have
see
the
gentleman
.
    
<EOS>
before
we
leave
Hatfield
,
my
uncle
,
fix
his
eye
on
Martin
with
such
expression
,
as
be
more
easily
conceive
than
describe
,
ask
,
if
he
often
travel
that
road
?
<EOS>
and
he
reply
with
a
look
which
denote
his
understanding
the
question
,
that
he
very
seldom
do
business
in
that
part
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
this
adventurer
favour
us
with
his
company
to
the
neighbourhood
of
Stevenage
,
where
he
take
his
leave
of
the
coach
and
me
,
in
very
polite
term
,
and
turn
off
upon
a
crossroad
,
that
lead
to
a
village
on
the
left
.
  
<EOS>
at
supper
,
Mrs
Tabby
be
very
full
in
the
praise
of
Mr
Martin
's
good
-
sense
and
good
-
breeding
,
and
seem
to
regret
that
she
have
not
a
further
opportunity
to
make
some
experiment
upon
his
affection
.
<EOS>
in
the
morning
,
my
uncle
be
not
a
little
surprised
to
receive
from
the
waiter
,
a
billet
couch
in
these
word
:
     
"
Sir
,
I
could
easily
perceive
from
your
look
,
when
I
have
the
honour
to
converse
with
you
at
Hatfield
,
that
my
character
be
not
unknown
to
you
;
and
,
I
dare
say
,
you
will
not
think
it
strange
,
that
I
should
be
glad
to
change
my
present
way
of
life
,
for
any
honest
occupation
,
<EOS>
let
it
be
ever
so
humble
,
that
will
afford
me
bread
in
moderation
,
and
sleep
in
safety
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
you
may
think
I
flatter
,
when
I
say
,
that
from
the
moment
I
be
witness
to
your
generous
concern
in
the
cause
of
your
servant
<EOS>
,
I
conceive
a
particular
esteem
and
veneration
for
your
person
;
and
yet
what
I
say
be
true
.
<EOS>
I
should
think
myself
happy
,
if
I
could
be
admit
into
your
protection
and
service
,
as
a
house
-
steward
,
clerk
,
butler
,
or
bailiff
,
for
either
of
which
place
<EOS>
I
think
myself
tolerably
well
qualified
;
and
,
sure
I
be
,
I
should
not
be
find
deficient
in
gratitude
and
fidelity
:
at
the
same
time
,
I
be
very
sensible
how
much
you
must
deviate
from
the
common
maxim
of
discretion
,
even
in
put
my
profession
to
the
trial
;
but
I
do
not
look
upon
you
as
a
person
that
think
in
the
ordinary
stile
;
and
the
delicacy
of
my
situation
will
,
I
know
,
justify
this
address
to
a
heart
warm
with
benificence
and
compassion
.
  
<EOS>
understanding
you
be
go
pretty
far
north
,
I
shall
take
an
opportunity
to
throw
myself
in
your
way
again
,
before
you
reach
the
border
of
Scotland
;
and
I
hope
,
by
that
time
,
you
will
have
take
into
consideration
the
truly
distressful
case
of
,
    
"
honour
sir
,
your
very
humble
,
and
devoted
servant
,
Edward
Martin
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
"
squire
,
have
peruse
this
letter
,
put
it
into
my
hand
without
say
a
syllable
and
,
when
I
have
read
it
,
we
look
at
each
other
in
silence
.
<EOS>
from
a
certain
sparkling
in
his
eye
,
I
discover
there
be
more
in
his
heart
,
than
he
care
to
express
with
his
tongue
,
in
favour
of
poor
Martin
;
and
this
be
precisely
my
own
feeling
,
which
he
do
not
fail
to
discern
,
by
the
same
mean
of
communication
 
<EOS>
"
what
shall
we
do
(
say
he
)
to
save
this
poor
sinner
from
the
gallow
,
and
make
him
a
useful
member
of
the
commonwealth
?
<EOS>
and
yet
the
proverb
say
,
save
a
thief
from
the
gallow
,
and
he
will
cut
your
throat
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
him
,
I
really
believe
Martin
be
capable
of
give
the
proverb
the
lie
;
and
that
I
should
heartily
concur
in
any
step
he
may
take
in
favour
of
his
solicitation
.
<EOS>
We
mutually
resolve
to
deliberate
upon
the
subject
,
and
in
the
mean
time
,
proceed
on
our
journey
.
<EOS>
the
road
,
have
be
break
up
by
the
heavy
rain
in
the
spring
,
be
so
rough
,
that
although
we
travel
very
slowly
,
the
jolting
occasion
such
pain
to
my
uncle
,
that
he
be
become
exceedingly
peevish
when
we
arrive
at
this
place
,
which
lie
about
eight
mile
from
the
post
-
road
,
between
,
Whetherby
and
Boroughbridge
.
    
<EOS>
Harrigate
-
water
,
so
celebrate
for
its
efficacy
in
the
scurvy
and
other
distemper
,
be
supply
from
a
copious
spring
,
in
the
hollow
of
a
wild
common
,
round
<EOS>
which
,
a
good
many
house
have
be
build
for
the
convenience
of
drinker
,
though
few
of
them
be
inhabit
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
company
lodge
at
some
distance
,
in
five
separate
inn
,
situate
in
different
part
of
the
common
,
<EOS>
from
whence
they
go
every
morning
to
the
well
,
in
their
own
carriage
.
<EOS>
the
lodger
of
each
inn
form
a
distinct
society
,
that
eat
together
;
and
there
be
a
commodious
,
public
room
,
where
they
breakfast
in
dishabille
,
at
separate
table
,
from
eight
o'clock
till
eleven
,
as
they
chance
or
choose
to
come
in
 
here
also
they
drink
tea
in
the
afternoon
,
and
play
at
card
or
dance
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
one
custom
,
however
,
prevail
,
which
I
look
upon
as
a
solecism
in
politeness
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
treat
with
tea
in
their
turn
;
and
even
girl
of
sixteen
be
not
extempte
from
this
shameful

there

Harrigate

tread
upon
the
heel
of
Bath
,
in
the
article
of
gaiety
and
dissipation
  
with
this
difference
,
however
,
that
here
we
be
more
sociable
and
familiar
.
<EOS>
one
of
the

be
already
full
up

fifty

Our

do
not
exceed
thirty

six

and
I
should
be
sorry
to
see
the
number
augment
,
as
our
accommodation
will
not
admit
of
much
increase
.
    
<EOS>
at

the
company
be
more
agreeable
than
one
could
expect
from
an
accidental
assemblage
of
person
who
be
utter
stranger

<EOS>
there
seem

be
a

disposition
among

maintain
good

promote
the

in

of
those
who
come

<EOS>
I
see
several
face
which
we
leave
at
Bath
,
although
the
majority
be
of
the
northern
county

and
may
come
from
Scotland
for
the
benefit
of
these
water
 
in
such
a
variety
,
there
must
be
some
original
,
among
whom
Mrs
Tabitha
Bramble
be
not
the
most
inconsiderable
  
no
place
where
there
be
such
an
intercourse
between
the
sex
,
can
be
disagreeable
to
a
lady
of
her
view
and
temperament
 
<EOS>
She
have
have
some
warm
dispute
at
table
,
with
a
lame
parson
from
Northumberland
,
on
the
new
birth
,
and
the
insignificance
of
moral
virtue
;
and
her
argument
have
be
reinforce
by
an
old
Scotch
lawyer
,
in
a
tye
-
periwig
,
who
,
though
he
have
lose
his
tooth
,
and
the
use
of
his
limb

can
still
wag
his
tongue
with
great
volubility

<EOS>
He
have
pay
her
such
fulsome
compliment
,
upon
her
piety
and
learning
,
as
seem
to
have
win
her
heart
;
and
she
,
in
her
turn
,
treat
him
with
such
attention
as
indicate
a
design
upon
his
person
;
but
,
by
all
acount
,
he
be
too
much
a
fox
to
be
inveigle
into
any
snare
that
she
can
lay
for
his
affection

<EOS>
We
do
not
purpose
to
stay

at
Harrigate

,
at

it
be
our

<EOS>
from
whence
we

Harrigate

<EOS>
to
Dr

<EOS>
DEAR
DOCTOR
,
consider
the
tax
we
pay
for
turnpike
,
the
road
of
this
country
constitute
a
most
intolerable
grievance
.
<EOS>
between
Newark
and
Weatherby
,
I
have
suffer
more
from
jolt
and
swinging
,
than
ever
I
feel
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
,
although
the
carriage
be
remarkably
commodious
and
well
hung
,
and
the
postillion
be
very
careful
in
drive
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
safely
house
at
the
New
Inn
at
Harrigate
,
whither
I
come
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
,
rather
than
with
any
view
of
advantage
to
my
health
;
and
truly
,
after
have
consider
all
the
part
and
particular
of
the
place
I
can
not
account
for
the
concourse
of
people
one
find
here
,
upon
any
other
principle
but
that
of
caprice
,
which
seem
to
be
the
character
of
our
nation
.
    
<EOS>
Harrigate
be
a
wild
common
,
bare
and
bleak
without
tree
or
shrub
,
or
the
least
sign
of
cultivation
;
and
the
people
who
come
to
drink
the
water
,
be
crowd
together
in
paltry
inn
,
where
the
few
tolerable
room
be
monopolize
by
the
friend
and
favourite
of
the
house
,
and
all
the
rest
of
the
lodger
be
oblige
to
put
up
with
dirty
hole
,
where
there
be
neither
space
,
air
,
nor
convenience
.
<EOS>
My
apartment
be
about
ten
foot
square
;
and
when
the
fold
bed
be
down
,
there
be
just
room
sufficient
to
pass
between
it
and
the
fire
.
<EOS>
one
may
expect
,
indeed
,
that
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
a
fire
at
midsummer
;
but
here
the
climate
be
so
backward
,
that
an
ash
tree
,
which
our
landlord
have
plant
before
my
window
,
be
just
begin
to
put
forth
its
leave
;
and
I
be
fain
to
have
my
bed
warm
every
night
.
    
<EOS>
as
for
the
water
,
which
be
say
to
have
effect
so
many
surprising
cure
,
I
have
drink
it
once
,
and
the
first
draught
have
cure
me
of
all
desire
to
repeat
the
medicine
.
  
<EOS>
some
people
say
it
smell
of
rotten
egg
,
and
other
's
compare
it
to
the
scouring
of
a
foul
gun
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
generally
suppose
to
be
strongly
impregnate
with
sulphur
;
and
Dr
Shaw
,
in
his
book
upon
mineral
water
,
say
,
he
have
see
flake
of
sulphur
float
in
the
well
 
pace
tanti
viri
;
I
,
for
my
part
,
have
never
observe
any
thing
like
sulphur
,
either
in
or
or
about
the
well
,
neither
<EOS>
do
I
find
that
any
brimstone
have
ever
be
extract
from
the
water
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
smell
,
if
I
may
be
allow
to
judge
from
my
own
organ
,
it
be
exactly
that
of
bilge
-
water
;
and
the
saline
taste
of
it
seem
to
declare
,
that
it
be
nothing
else
than
salt
water
putrifie
in
the
bowel
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
hold
my
nose
with
one
hand
,
while
I
advance
the
glass
to
my
mouth
with
the
other
;
and
after
I
have
make
shift
to
swallow
it
,
my
stomach
could
hardly
retain
what
it
have
receive
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
effect
it
produce
be
sickness
,
gripe
,
and
insurmountable
disgust
 
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
mention
it
without
puke
.
  
<EOS>
the
world
be
strangely
mislead
by
the
affectation
of
singularity
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
suspect
,
that
this
water
owe
its
reputation
in
a
great
measure
to
its
being
so
strikingly
offensive
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
same
kind
of
analogy
,
a
german
doctor
have
introduce
hemlock
and
other
poison
,
as
specific
,
into
the
materia
medica
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
persuade
,
<EOS>
that
all
the
cure
ascribe
to
the
Harrigate
water
,
would
have
be
as
efficaciously
,
and
infinitely
more
agreeably
perform
by
the
internal
and
external
use
of
sea
-
water
.
<EOS>
sure
I
be
,
this
last
be
much
less
nauseous
to
the
taste
and
smell
,
and
much
more
gentle
in
its
operation
as
a
purge
,
as
well
as
more
extensive
in
its
medical
quality
.
    
<EOS>
two
day
ago
,
we
go
across
the
country
to
visit
"
squire
Burdock
,
who
marry
a
first
cousin
of
my
father
,
an
heiress
,
who
bring
him
an
estate
of
a
thousand
a
year
.
<EOS>
this
gentleman
be
a
declare
opponent
of
the
ministry
in
parliament
;
and
,
have
an
opulent
fortune
,
pique
himself
upon
live
in
the
country
,
and
maintain
old
english
hospitality
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
bye
,
this
be
a
phrase
very
much
use
by
the
English
themselves
,
both
in
word
and
writing
;
but
I
never
hear
of
it
out
of
the
island
,
except
by
way
of
irony
and
sarcasm
.
<EOS>
what
the
hospitality
of
our
forefather
have
be
,
I
should
be
glad
to
see
record
,
rather
in
the
memoir
of
stranger
who
have
visit
our
country
,
and
be
the
proper
object
and
judge
of
such
hospitality
,
than
in
the
discourse
and
lucubration
of
the
modern
English
,
who
seem
to
describe
it
from
theory
and
conjecture
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
we
be
generally
look
upon
by
foreigner
,
as
a
people
totally
destitute
of
this
virtue
;
and
I
never
be
in
any
country
abroad
,
where
I
do
not
meet
with
person
of
distinction
who
complain
of
have
be
inhospitably
use
in
Great
Britain
.
<EOS>
a
gentleman
of
France
,
Italy
,
or
Germany
,
who
have
entertain
and
lodge
an
Englishman
at
his
house
,
when
he
afterwards
meet
with
his
guest
at
London
,
be
ask
to
dinner
at
the
Saracen
's
head
,
the
Turk's
-
head
the
Boar's
-
head
,
or
the
Bear
,
eat
raw
beef
and
butter
,
drink
execrable
port
,
and
be
allow
to
pay
his
share
of
the
reckoning
.
    
<EOS>
but
to
return
from
this
digression
,
which
my
feeling
for
the
honour
of
my
country
oblige
me
to
make
 
our
Yorkshire
cousin
have
be
a
mighty
fox
-
hunter
before
the
Lord
;
but
now
he
be
too
fat
and
unweildy
to
leap
ditch
and
five
bar
-
gate
;
nevertheless
he
still
keep
a
pack
of
hound
,
which
be
well
exercise
;
and
his
huntsman
every
night
entertain
him
with
the
adventure
of
the
day
's
chace
,
which
he
recite
in
a
tone
and
term
that
be
extremely
curious
and
significant
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
his
broad
brawn
be
scratch
by
one
of
his
groom
.
  
<EOS>
this
fellow
,
it
seem
,
have
no
inclination
to
curry
any
beast
out
of
the
stable
,
be
at
great
pain
to
scollop
his
nail
in
such
a
manner
that
the
blood
follow
at
every
stroke
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
in
hope
that
he
would
be
dissmisse
from
this
disagreable
office
,
but
the
event
turn
out
contrary
to
his
expectation
.
  
<EOS>
His
master
declare
he
be
the
good
scratch
in
the
family
;
and
now
he
will
not
suffer
any
other
servant
to
draw
a
nail
upon
his
carcase
.
    
<EOS>
the
"
squire
's
lady
be
very
proud
,
without
be
stiff
or
inaccessible
.
  
<EOS>
She
receive
even
her
inferior
in
point
of
fortune
with
a
kind
of
arrogant
civility
;
but
then
she
think
she
have
a
right
to
treat
them
with
the
most
ungracious
freedom
of
speech
,
and
never
fail
to
let
them
know
she
be
sensible
of
her
own
superior
affluence
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
she
speak
well
of
no
live
soul
,
and
have
not
one
single
friend
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
hate
her
mortally
;
but
,
although
the
brute
be
sometimes
so
very
powerful
in
him
that
he
will
have
his
own
way
,
he
generally
truckle
to
her
dominion
,
and
dread
like
a
school
-
boy
,
the
lash
of
her
tongue
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
she
be
afraid
of
provoke
him
too
far
,
lest
he
should
make
some
desperate
effort
to
shake
of
her
yoke
.
  
<EOS>
She
,
therefore
,
acquiesce
in
the
proof
he
daily
give
of
his
attachment
to
the
liberty
of
an
english
freeholder
,
by
say
and
do
,
at
his
own
table
,
whatever
gratify
the
brutality
of
his
disposition
,
or
contribute
to
the
case
of
his
person
.
<EOS>
the
house
,
tho
'
large
,
be
neither
elegant
nor
comfortable
 
<EOS>
It
look
like
a
great
inn
,
crowd
with
traveller
,
who
dine
at
the
landlord
's
ordinary
,
where
there
be
a
great
profusion
of
victual
and
drink
,
but
mine
host
seem
to
be
misplace
;
and
I
would
rather
dine
upon
filbert
with
a
hermit
,
than
feed
upon
venison
with
a
hog
.
<EOS>
the
footman
may
be
aptly
compare
to
the
waiter
of
a
tavern
,
if
they
be
more
serviceable
and
less
rapacious
;
but
they
be
generally
insolent
and
inattentive
,
and
so
greedy
,
that
,
I
think
,
I
can
dine
better
,
and
for
less
expence
,
at
the
Star
and
Garter
in
Pall
-
mall
,
than
at
our
cousin
's
castle
in
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
the
"
squire
be
also
bless
with
an
only
son
,
about
two
and
twenty
,
just
return
from
Italy
,
a
complete
fidler
and
dillettante
;
and
he
slip
no
opportunity
of
manifest
the
most
perfect
contempt
for
his
own
father
.
    
<EOS>
when
we
arrive
,
there
be
a
family
of
foreigner
at
the
house
,
on
a
visit
to
this
virtuoso
,
with
whom
they
have
be
acquaint
at
the
Spa
;
it
be
the
count
de
Melville
,
with
his
lady
,
on
their
way
to
Scotland
.
<EOS>
Mr
Burdock
have
meet
with
an
accident
,
in
consequence
of
which
both
the
count
and
I
would
have
retire
but
the
young
gentleman
and
his
mother
insist
upon
our
stay
dinner
;
and
their
serenity
seem
to
be
so
little
ruffle
by
what
have
happen
,
that
we
comply
with
their
invitation
.
<EOS>
the
"
squire
have
be
bring
home
over
night
in
his
postchaise
,
so
terribly
belabour
about
the
pate
,
that
he
seem
to
be
in
a
state
of
stupesaction
,
and
have
ever
since
remain
speechless
.
<EOS>
a
country
apothecary
,
call
Grieve
,
who
live
in
a
neighbouring
village
,
have
be
call
to
his
assistance
,
have
let
him
blood
,
and
apply
a
poultice
to
his
head
,
declare
,
that
he
have
no
fever
,
nor
any
other
bad
symptom
but
the
loss
of
speech
,
if
he
really
have
lose
that
faculty
.
<EOS>
but
the
young
"
squire
say
this
practitioner
be
an
ignorantaccio
,
that
there
be
a
fracture
in
the
cranium
,
and
that
there
be
a
necessity
for
have
him
trepan
without
loss
of
time
.
<EOS>
His
mother
espouse
this
opinion
,
have
send
an
express
to
York
for
a
surgeon
to
perform
the
operation
,
and
he
be
already
come
with
his
"
prentice
and
instrument
.
<EOS>
have
examine
the
patient
's
head
,
he
begin
to
prepare
his
dressing
;
though
Grieve
still
retain
his
first
opinion
that
there
be
no
fracture
,
and
be
the
more
confirmed
in
it
as
the
"
squire
have
pass
the
night
in
profound
sleep
,
uninterrupted
by
any
catching
or
convulsion
.
<EOS>
the
York
surgeon
say
he
could
not
tell
whether
there
be
a
fracture
,
until
he
should
take
of
the
scalp
,
but
,
at
any
rate
,
the
operation
may
be
of
service
,
in
give
vent
to
any
blood
that
may
be
extravasate
,
either
above
or
below
the
dura
mater
.
<EOS>
the
lady
and
her
son
be
clear
for
try
the
experiment
;
and
Grieve
be
dismiss
with
some
mark
of
contempt
;
which
,
perhaps
,
he
owe
to
the
plainness
of
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
be
about
the
middle
age
,
wear
his
own
black
hair
without
any
sort
of
dressing
;
by
his
garb
,
one
would
have
take
him
for
a
quaker
,
but
he
have
none
of
the
stiffness
of
that
sect
,
on
the
contrary
,
he
be
very
submissive
,
respectful
,
and
remarkably
taciturn
.
    
<EOS>
leave
the
lady
in
an

adjourn
to

chamber

where
the
dressing

in
order
upon
a
pewter
dish

<EOS>
the
operator
,
lay
aside
his
coat
and
periwig
,
equip
himself
with
a
night
-
cap
,
apron
,
and
sleeve
,
while
his
"
prentice
and
footman
,
seize
the
"
squire
's
head
,
begin
to
place
it
in
a
proper
posture
.
  
<EOS>

mark
what
follow

<EOS>
the
patient
,
bolt
upright
in
the
bed
,
collar
each
of
these
assistant
with
the
grasp
of
Hercules
,
exclaim
,
in
a
bellowing
tone
,
"
I
ha'n't
live
so
long
in
Yorkshire
to
be
trepan
by
such
vermin
as
you
;
"
and
leap
on
the
floor
,
put
on
his
breech
quietly
,
to
the
astonishment
of
us
all
.
<EOS>
the
surgeon
still
insist
upon
the
operation
,
alledge
it
be
now
plain
that
the
brain
be
injure
,
and
desire
the
servant
to
put
him
into
bed
again
;
but
no
body
would
venture
to
execute
his
order
,
or
even
to
interpose
:
when
the
"
squire
turn
him
and
his
assistant
out
of
door
,
and
throw
his
apparatus
out
at
the
window
.
<EOS>
have
thus
assert
his
prerogative
,
and
put
on
his
cloath

the
help
of

my
nephew
and
me
,
be
introduce
by
his
son
,
and
receive
with
his
usual
stile
of
rustic
civility
;
then
turn
to
signor
Macaroni
,
with
a
sarcastic
grin
,
"
I
tell
thee

what

that
I

old
fox
in
the
West
Riding

"
    
<EOS>
We
afterwards
understand
he
have
quarrel
at
a
public
house
with
an
exciseman
,
whom
he
challenge
to
a
bout
at
single
stick
,
in
which
he
have
be
worst
;
and
that
the
shame
of
this
defeat
have
tie
up
his
tongue
.
<EOS>
as
for
madam
,
she
have
shew
no
concern
for
his
disaster
,
and
now
hear
of
his
recovery
without
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
take
some
little
notice
of
my
sister
and
niece
,
though
rather
with
a
view
to
indulge
her
own
petulance
,
than
out
of
any
sentiment
of
regard
to
our
family
.
  
<EOS>
She
say
Liddy
be
a
fright
,
and
order
her
woman
to
adjust
her
head
before
dinner
;
but
she
would
not
meddle
with
Tabby
,
whose
spirit
,
she
soon
perceive
,
be
not
to
be
irritate
with
impunity
.
<EOS>
at
table
,
she
acknowledge
me
so
far
as
to
say
she
have
hear
of
my
father
;
though
she
hint
,
that
he
have
disoblige
her
family
by
make
a
poor
match
in
Wales
.
<EOS>
She
be
disagreeably
familiar
in
her
inquiry
about
our
circumstance
;
and
ask
,
if
I
intend
to
bring
up
my
nephew
to
the
law
.
<EOS>
I
tell
her
,
that
,
as
he
have
an
independent
fortune
,
he
should
follow
no
profession
but
that
of
a
country
gentleman
;
and
that
I
be
not
without
hope
of
procure
for
him
a
seat
in
parliament
.
 
<EOS>
"
pray
,
cousin
,
(
say
she
)
<EOS>
what
may
his
fortune
be
?
"
<EOS>
when
I
answer
,
that
with
what
I
should
be
able
to
give
him
,
he
would
have
well
than
two
thousand
a
year
,
she
reply
,
with
a
disdainful
toss
of
her
head
,
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
preserve
his
independence
on
such
a
paltry
provision
.
    
<EOS>
not
a
little
nettle
at
this
arrogant
remark
,
I
tell
her
,
I
have
the
honour
to
sit
in
parliament
with
her
father
,
when
he
have
little
more
than
half
that
income
;
and
I
believe
there
be
not
a
more
independent
and
incorruptible
member
in
the
house

<EOS>
ay

"
if
that

case
,
(
say
I
)
'
<EOS>
tis
a
wonder
you
can
maintain
it
at
so
small
an
expence
;
but
every
private
gentleman
be
not
expect
to
keep
a
caravansera
for
the
accommodation
of
traveller
:
indeed
,
if
every
individual
live
in
the

stile
,
you
would
not
have
such
a
number
of
guest
at
your

your
hospitality
would
not
shine
so
bright
for

"
the
young

by

ironical
observation

,
"

"
    
<EOS>
I
be
much
pleased
with
the
count
de
Melville
,
who
be
sensible
,
easy
,
and
polite
;
and
the
countess
be
the
most
amiable
woman
I
ever
beheld
.
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
they
take
leave
of
their
entertainer
,
and
the
young
gentleman
,
mount
his
horse
,
undertake
to
conduct
their
coach
through
the
park
,
while
one
of

the
moment
their

,
the
censorious
daemon
take
possession
of
our
Yorkshire
landlady

our
sister
Tabitha

<EOS>
the
former
observe
,
that
the
countess
be
a
good
sort
of
a
body
,
but
totally
ignorant
of
good
breeding
,
consequently
aukward
in
her
address
.
<EOS>
the
"
squire
say
he
do
not
pretend
to
the
breeding
of
any
thing

colt

but
that
the
jade
would
be
very
handsome

more

Handsome

she
have
indeed
a

turn
to

Liddy

be
an

<EOS>
tabby
chid
her
for
talk
with
such
freedom

,
in

contemptuous
tone

she

<EOS>
Our
conversation
be
suddenly
interrupt
by
the
young
gentleman
,
who
gallop
into
the
yard
all
aghast
,
exclaim
,
that
the
coach
be
attack
by
a
great
number
of
highwayman

<EOS>
My

I
rush
out
,
find
his
own

his

horse
ready
saddle
in
the
stable

with
pistol
in
the
cap

<EOS>
We
mount
instantly
,
order
Clinker
and
Dutton
to
follow
with
all
possible
expedition
;
but
notwithstanding
all
the
speed
we
could
make
,
the
action
be
over
before
we
arrive

and
the
count
with
his
lady
safely
lodge
at
the
house
of
Grieve
,
who
signalize
himself
in
a
very
remarkable
manner
on
this
occasion

<EOS>
at
the
turning
of
a
lane
,
that
lead
to
the
village
where
the
count
's
servant
remain
,
a
couple
of
robber

horseback
suddenly
appear
,
with
their
pistol
advance
:

one
keep
the
coachman
in
awe

the
other
demand
the
count

money
,
while
the
young

squire
go
off
at
full
speed
without
ever
cast
a
look
behind
.
<EOS>
the
count
desire
the
thief
to
withdraw
his
pistol
,
as
the
lady
be
in
great
terror
,
deliver
his
purse
without
make
the
least
resistance
:
but
not
satisfied
with
this
,
booty
;
which
be
pretty
considerable
,
the
rascal
nsiste
upon
rifle
her
of
her
ear
-
ring
and
necklace
,
and
the
countess
scream
with
affright
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
,
exasperate
at
the
violence
with
which
she
be
threaten
,
wrest
the
pistol
out
of
the
fellow
's
hand
,
and
turn
it
upon
him
,
snap
it
in
his
face
;
but
the
robber
know
there
be
no
charge
in
it
,
draw
another
from
his
bosom
,
and
in
all
probability
would
have
kill
him
on
the
spot
,
have
not
his
life
be
save
by
a
wonderful
interposition
.
<EOS>
Grieve
,
the
apothecary
,
chance
to
pass
that
very
instant
,
run
up
to
the
coach
,
and
with
a
crab
stick
,
which
be
all
the
weapon
he
have
,
bring
the
fellow
to
the
ground
with
the
first
blow
;
then
seize
his
pistol
,
present
it
to
his
colleague
,
who
fire
his
piece
at
random
,
and
flee
without
further
opposition
.
<EOS>
the
other
be
secure
by
the
assistance
of
the
count

the
coachman

his
leg
be
tie
under

belly
of
his
own
horse

Grieve
conduct
him
to
the
village

whither
also

carriage

<EOS>
It
be
with
great
difficulty
the
countess
could
be
keep
from
swoon
;

at
last
she
be
happily
convey
to
the
house

prepare
some
drop
for
her

I
find

express
much
impatience

what
be

I.
"
sixteen
year

(
answer
the

<EOS>
the
count
,
without
speak
another
syllable
,
rush
into
the
parlour
,
cry
,
"

<EOS>
Mrs
Grieve
,
then
seize
the
countess
by
the
hand
,
exclaim
with
great
agitation
,
"

the
generous
 
the
glorious
benefactor

"
    
<EOS>
the
countess
rise
from
her
seat
,
throw
her
arm
about
the
neck
of
the
amiable
Seraphina
,
and
clapse
her
to
her
breast
with
great
tenderness
,
while
she
herself
be
embrace
by
the
weeping
mother

<EOS>
this
move
scene
be
complete
by
the
entrance
of
Grieve
himself
,
who
fall
on
his
knee
before
the
count
,
Behold
(
say
he
)
a
penitent
,
who
at
length
can
look
upon
his
patron
without
shrink

"
<EOS>

cry
he

be
indebted

"
<EOS>
"
Heaven
have
hear
my
prayer
,
(
say
the
other
)
and
give
me
an
opportunity
to
prove
myself
not
altogether
unworthy
of
your
clemency
and
protection
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
kiss
the
hand
of
the
countess
,
while
monsieur
de
Melville
salute
his
wife
and
lovely
daughter
,
and
all
of
us
be
greatly
affect
by
this
pathetic
recognition
.
    
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
Grieve
be
no
other
than
Ferdinand
count
Fathom
,
whose
adventure
be
print
many
year
ago
.
<EOS>
be
a
sincere
convert
to
virtue
,
he
have
change
his
name
,
that
he
may
elude
the
inquiry
of
the
count
,
whose
generous
allowance
he
determine
to
forego
,
that
he
may
have
no
dependence
but
upon
his
own
industry
and
moderation
.
<EOS>
He
have
accordingly
settle
in
this
village
as
a
practitioner
in
surgery
and
physic
,
and
for
some
year
wrestle
with
all
the
misery
of
indigence
,
which
,
however
,
he
and
his
wife
have
bear
with
the
most
exemplary
resignation
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
by
dint
of
unwearied
attention
to
the
duty
of
his
profession
,
which
he
exercise
with
equal
humanity
and
success
,
he
have
acquire
a
tolerable
share
of
business
among
the
farmer
and
common
people
,
which
enable
him
to
live
in
a
decent
manner
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
scarce
even
see
to
smile
;
be
unaffectedly
pious
;
and
all
the
time
he
could
spare
from
the
avocation
of
his
employment
he
spend
in
educate
his
daughter
,
and
in
study
for
his
own
improvement
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
adventurer
Fathom
be
,
under
the
name
of
Grieve
,
universally
respect
among
the
commonalty
of
this
district
,
as
a
prodigy
of
learning
and
virtue
.
<EOS>
these
particular
I
learn
from
the
vicar
,
when
we
quit
the
room
,
that
they
may
be
under
no
restraint
in
their
mutual
effusion
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
doubt
that
Grieve
will
be
press
to
leave
off
business
,

as
the

extremely
fond

she
will
in
all
probability
insist
upon
Seraphina

<EOS>
have
pay
our
compliment
to
these
noble
person
,
we
return
to
the
"
squire
,
where
we
expect
an
invitation
to
pass
the
night
,
which
be
wet
and
raw
;
but
it
seem
"
squire
Burdock
's
hospitality
reach
not
so
far
for
the
honour
of
yorkshire
:
we
depart
in
the
evening
,
and
lie
at
an
inn
,
where
I
catch
cold
.
    
<EOS>
in
hope
of
ride
it
down
before
it
could
take
fast
hold
on
my
constitution
,
I
resolve
to
visit
another
relation
,
one
Mr
Pimpernel
,
who
live
about
a
dozen
mile
from
the
place
where
we
lodge
.
<EOS>
pimpernel
,
be
the
young
of
four
son
,
be
breed
an
attorney
at
Furnival's
-
inn
;
but
all
his
eld
brother
die
<EOS>
,
he
get
himself
call
to
the
bar
for
the
honour
of
his
family
,
and
soon
after
this
preferment
,
succeed
to
his
father
's
estate
,
which
be
very
considerable
.
<EOS>
He
carry
home
with
him
all
the
knavish
chicanery
of
the
low
pettifogger
,
together
with
a
wife
whom
he
have
purchase
of
a
drayman
for
twenty
pound
;
and
he
soon
find
mean
to
obtain
a
Dedimus
as
an
act
justice
of
peace
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
only
a
sordid
miser
in
his
disposition
,
but
his
avarice
be
mingle
with
a
spirit
of
despotism
,
which
be
truly
diabolical
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
brutal
husband
,
an
unnatural
parent
,
a
harsh
master
,
an
oppressive
landlord
,
a
litigious
neighbour
,
and
a
partial
magistrate
.
  
<EOS>
friend
he
have
none
;
and
in
point
of
hospitality
and
good
breeding
,
our
cousin
Burdock
be
a
prince
in
comparison
of
this
ungracious
miscreant
,
whose
house
be
the
lively
representation
of
a
goal
.
<EOS>
Our
reception
be
suitable
to
the
character
I
have
sketch
.
<EOS>
have
it
depend
upon
the
wife
,
we
should
have
be
kindly
treat
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
really
a
good
sort
of
a
woman
,
in
spite
of
her
low
original
,
and
well
respect
in
the
country
;
but
she
have
not
interest
enough
in
her
own
house
to
command
a
draught
of
table
-
beer
,
far
less
to
bestow
any
kind
of
education
on
her
child
,
who
run
about
,
like
ragged
colt
,
in
a
state
of
nature
.
  
<EOS>
Pox
on
him
!
<EOS>
he
be
such
a
dirty
fellow
,
that
I
have
not
patience
to
prosecute
the
subject
.
    
<EOS>
by
the
time
we
reach
Harrigate
,
I
begin
to
be
visit
by
certain
rheumatic
symptom
.
<EOS>
the
Scoth
lawyer
,
Mr
Micklewhimmen
,
recommend
a
hot
bath
of
these
water
so
earnestly
that
I
be
over
-
persuade
to
try
the
experiment
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
use
it
often
with
success
,
and
always
stay
an
hour
in
the
bath
,
which
be
a
tub
fill
with
Harrigate
water
,
heat
for
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
if
I
could
hardly
bear
the
smell
of
a
single
tumbler
when
cold
,
you
may
guess
how
my
nose
be
regale
by
the
steam
arise
from
a
hot
bath
of
the
same
fluid
.
<EOS>
at
night
,
I
be
conduct
into
a
dark
hole
on
the
ground
floor
,
where
the
tub
smoake
and
stink
like
the
pot
of
Acheron
,
in
one
corner
,
and
in
another
stand
a
dirty
bed
provide
with
thick
blanket
,
in
which
I
be
to
sweat
after
come
out
of
the
bath
.
<EOS>
My
heart
seem
to
die
within
me
when
I
enter
this
dismal
bagnio
,
and
sound
my
brain
assault
by
such
insufferable
effluvia
.
  
<EOS>
I
curse
Micklewhimmen
for
not
consider
that
my
organ
be
form
on
this
side
of
the
Tweed
;
but
be
ashamed
to
recoil
upon
the
treshold
,
I
submit
to
the
process
.
    
<EOS>
after
have
endure
all
but
real
suffocation
for
above
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
the
tub
,
I
be
move
to
the
bed
and
wrap
in
blanket
 
<EOS>
there
I
lie
a
full
hour
pant
with
intollerable
heat
;
but
not
the
least
moisture
appear
on
my
skin
,
I
be
carry
to
my
chamber
,
and
pass
the
night
without
close
an
eye
,
in
such
a
flutter
of
spirit
as
render
me
the
most
miserable
wretch
in
being
.
<EOS>
I
should
certainly
have
run
distract
,
if
the
rarefaction
of
my
blood
,
occasion
by
that
stygian
bath
,
have
not
burst
the
vessel
,
and
produce
a
violent
haemorage
,
which
,
though
dreadful
and
alarming
,
remove
the
horrible
disquiet
.
  
<EOS>
I
lose
two
pound
of
blood
,
and
more
,
on
this
occasion
;
and
find
myself
still
weak
and
languid
;
but
,
I
believe
,
a
little
exercise
will
forward
my
recovery
;
and
therefore
I
be
resolve
to
set
out
to
-
morrow
for
York
,
in
my
way
to
Scarborough
,
where
I
propose
to
brace
up
my
fibre
by
a
sea
-
bathing
,
which
,
I
know
,
be
one
of
your
favourite
specific
.
<EOS>
there
be
however
,
one
disease
,
for
which
you
have
find
as
yet
no
specific
,
and
that
be
old
age
,
of
which
this
tedious
unconnected
epistle
be
an
infallible

what

DEAR
KNIGHT
,
the
manner
of
live
at
Harrigate
be
so
agreeable
to
my
disposition
,
that
I
leave
the
place
with
some
regret
 
Our
aunt
Tabby
would
have
probably
make
some
objection
to
our
departing
so
soon
,
have
not
an
accident
embroil
her
with
Mr
Micklewhimmen
,
the
Scotch
advocate
,
on
whose
heart
she
have
be
practise
,
from
the
second
day
after
our
arrival
 
<EOS>
that
original
,
though
seemingly
preclude
from
the
use
of
his
limb
,
have
turn
his
genius
to
good
account
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
by
dint
of
groaning
,
and
whining
,
he
have
excite
the
compassion
of
the
company
so
effectually
,
that
an
old
lady
,
who
occupy
the
very
good
apartment
in
the
house
,
give
it
up
for
his
ease
and
convenience
.
<EOS>
when
his
man
lead
him
into
the
Long
Room
,
all
the
female
be
immediately
in
commotion
.
  
<EOS>
one
set
an
elbow
-
chair
;
another
shake
up
the
cushion
;
a
third
bring
a
stool
;
and
a
fourth
a
pillow
,
for
the
accommondation
of
his
foot
 
<EOS>
two
lady
(
of
whom
Tabby
be
always
one
)
support
him
into
the
dining
-
room
,
and
place
him
properly
at
the
table
;
and
his
taste
be
indulge
with
a
succession
of
delicacy
,
cull
by
their
fair
hand
.
<EOS>
all
this
attention
he
repay
with
a
profusion
of
compliment
and
benediction
,
which
be
not
the
less
agreeable
for
be
deliver
in
the
scottish
dialect
.
<EOS>
as
for
Mrs
Tabitha
,
his
respect
be
particulary
address
to
her
,
and
do
not
fail
to
mingle
them
with
religious
reflection
,
touch
free
grace
,
know
her
bias
to
methodism
,
which
he
also
profess
upon
a
calvinistical
model
.
    
<EOS>
for
my
part
I
could
not
help
think
this
lawyer
be
not
such
an
invalid
as
he
pretend
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
observe
he
eat
very
heartily
three
time
a
-
day
;
and
tho
'
his
bottle
be
mark
stomachic
tincture
,
he
have
recourse
to
it
so
often
,
and
seem
to
swallow
it
with
such
peculiar
relish
,
that
I
suspect
it
be
not
compound
in
the
apothecary
's
shop
,
or
the
chemist
's
laboratory
.
<EOS>
one
day
,
while
he
be
earnest
in
discourse
with
Mrs
Tabitha
,
and
his
servant
have
go
out
on
some
occasion
or
other
,
I
dexterously
exchange
the
label
,
and
situation
of
his
bottle
and
mine
;
and
have
taste
his
tincture
,
find
it
be
excellent
claret
.
<EOS>
I
forthwith
hand
it
about
to
some
of
my
neighbour
,
and
it
be
quite
empty
before
Mr
Micklewhimmen
have
occasion
to
repeat
his
draught
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
turn
about
,
he
take
hold
of
my
bottle
,
instead
of
his
own
,
and
,
fill
a
large
glass
,
drink
to
the
health
of
Mrs
Tabitha
 
<EOS>
It
have
scarce
touch
his
lip
when
he
perceive
the
change
which
have
be
put
upon
him
,
and
be
at
first
a
little
out
of
countenance
  
<EOS>
He
seem
to
retire
within
himself
,
in
order
to
deliberate
,
and
in
half
a
minute
his
resolution
be
take
;
address
himself
to
our
quater
,
<EOS>
"
I
give
the
gentleman
credit
for
his
wit
(
say
he
)
;
it
be
a
gude
practical
joke
;
but
sometimes
hi
joci
in
seria
ducunt
mala
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
,
for
his
own
sake
,
he
have
na
drank
all
the
liccor
;
for
it
be
a
vara
poorful
infusion
of
jallop
in
Bourdeaux
wine
:
as
it
be
possible
he
may
ha
ta'en
sic
a
dose
as
will
produce
a
terrible
catastrophe
in
his
ain
booel
.
"
     
<EOS>
by
far
the
great
part
of
the
content
have
fall
to
the
share
of
a
young
clothier
from
Leeds
,
who
have
come
to
make
a
figure
at
Harrigate
,
and
be
,
in
effect
,
a
great
coxcomb
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
It
be
with
a
view
to
laugh
at
his
fellow
guest
,
as
well
as
to
mortify
the
lawyer
,
that
he
have
empty
the
bottle
,
when
it
come
to
his
turn
,
and
he
have
laugh
accordingly
:
but
now
his
mirth
give
way
to
his
apprehension
  
<EOS>
He
begin
to
spit
,
to
make
wry
face
and
writhe
himself
into
various
contorsion

Rippon
for

Waugh

swallow
all

defend

violent
,

"
    
<EOS>
the
poor
clothier
's
torment
have
already
begin
:
he
retire
,
roar
with
pain
,
to
his
own
chamber
;
the
oil
be
swallow
,
and
the
doctor
send
for
;
but
before
he
arrive
,
the
miserable
patient
have
make
such
discharge
upwards
and
downward
,
that
nothing
remain
to
give
him
further
offence
;
and
this
double
evacuation
be
produce
by
imagination
alone
;
for
what
he
have
drink
be
genuine
wine
of
Bourdeaux
,
which
the
lawyer
have
bring
from
Scotland
for
his
own
private
use
.
<EOS>
the
clothier
,
find
the
joke
turn
out
so
expensive
and
disagreeable
,
quit
the
house
next
morning
,
leave
the
triumph
to
Micklewhimmen
,
who
enjoy
it
internally
,
without
any
outward
sign
of
exultation

on
the
contrary
,
he
affect
to
pity
the
young
man
for
what
he
have
suffer
,
and
acquire
fresh
credit
from
this
shew
of
moderation

<EOS>
It
be
about
the
middle
of
the
night
,
which
succeed
this
adventure
,
that
the
vent
of
the
kitchen
chimney
be
foul

foot
take
fire

the
alarm
be
give
in

dreadful
manner

every

leap
naked
out

in

the

fill
with
cry

confusion
 
there
be
two
stair

so
block
up

it

impossible

without

he
charge
through

conveyance

He
receive

I

Ye'll
please

there

twa
independent

Noo

in

instinct
take

when

it

therefore

beg
your

I

I

be
glad

<EOS>
whether
it
be
instinct
that
prompt
you

I

you
have
a
portmanteau
on

"
  
<EOS>
the
lawyer
answer
,
without
hesitation
,
"
Gif
I
may
tell
my
mind
freely
,
without
incur
the
suspicion
of
presumption
,
I
should
think
it
be
something
superior
to
either
reason
or
instinct
which
suggest
that
measure
,
and
this
on
a
twafald
account

in

the

contain
the

their

occasion
a

secondly

my
good
angel
seem
to
have
lay
the
portmantle
on
my
shoulder

by
way
of
defence

to
sustain
the
violence

a
most
inhuman
blow

the
crutch

sorely

by
your

I
be

I
crave
your
pardon

reverend
sir

say
the

instinct
never
act

out

this
sally
raise
the
laugh
against
Micklewhimmen

who
begin

look
grave

when
my

,
in
order
to
change
the
discourse

observe
,
that
instinct
have
be
very
kind
to
him
in
another
respect

it
have
restore
to
him
the
use

in

surprising
agility

<EOS>
He
reply
,
that
it
be
the
nature

brace
up
the
nerve

mention
some
surprising
feat
of
strength

activity
perform

he

the

further
demonstration

<EOS>
from
Harrigate

Scarborough

who
resort

to

and
the
diversion
be
pretty
much
on

at
Bath

<EOS>
the

within

very
inconvenient

so
that
he
have
nothing
further
to
do

but
to
open
the
door
,
and
come
down
as
he
go
up
 
Should
he
be
so
weak
or
ill
as
to
require
a
servant
to
put
off

on
his

there
be
room

the

they

a

the

be
admirably
adapt
for
this
practice
,
the
descent
be
gently
gradual
,
and
the
sand
soft

but
then
the
machine
can
be
use
only
at
a
certain
time
of
the
tide

which
vary
every

so
that
sometimes
the

be
oblige
to
rise
very
early
in

morning
  
for

I
love
swim

without

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
I

at
Scarborough

where
I
have
be
these
eight
day
  
<EOS>
from
Harrigate
we
come
hither
by
the
way
of
York
,
where
we
stay
only
one
day
to
visit
the
Castle
,
the
Minster
,
and
the
Assemblyroom
.
<EOS>
the
first
,
which
be
heretofore
a
fortress
,
be
now
convert
to
a
prison
,
and
be
the
good
,
in
all
respect
,
I
ever
see
at
home
or
abroad
  
<EOS>
It
stand
in
a
high
situation
,
extremely
well
ventilate
;
and
have
a
spacious
area
within
the
wall
,
for
the
health
;
and
convenience
of
all
the
prisoner
,
except
those
whom
it
be
necessary
to
secure
in
close
confinement
  
<EOS>
even
these
last
have
all
the
comfort
that
the
nature
of
their
situation
can
admit
.
<EOS>
here
the
assize
be
hold
,
in
a
rang
;
of
building
erect
for
that
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
as
for
the
Minster
,
I
know
not
how
to
distinguish
it
,
except
by
its
great
size
and
the
height
of
its
spire
,
from
those
other
ancient
church
in
different
part
of
the
kingdom
,
which
use
to
be
call
monument
of
gothic
architecture
;
but
it
be
now
agree
,
that
this
stile
be
Saracen
rather
than
Gothic
;
and
,
I
suppose
,
it
be
first
import
into
England
from
Spain
,
great
part
of
which
be
under
the
dominion
of
the
Moors
.
<EOS>
those
british
architect
,
who
adopt
this
stile
,
do
not
seem
to
have
consider
the
propriety
of
their
adoption
.
<EOS>
the
climate
of
the
coutry
,
possess
by
the
Moors
or
Saracens
,
both
in
Africa
and
Spain
,
be
so
exceedingly
hot
and
dry
,
that
those
who
build
place
of
worship
for
the
multitude
,
employ
their
talent
in
contrive
edefice
that
should
be
cool
;
and
,
for
this
purpose
,
nothing
could
be
better
adopt
than
those
building
;
vast
,
narrow
,
dark
,
and
lofty
,
impervious
to
the
sun
-
beam
,
and
have
little
communication
with
the
scorched
external
atmosphere
;
but
ever
afford
a
refresh
coolness
,
like
subterranean
cellar
in
the
heat
of
summer
,
or
natural
cavern
in
the
bowel
of
huge
mountain
.
<EOS>
but
nothing
could
be
more
preposterous
,
than
to
imitate
such
a
mode
of
architecture
in
a
country
like
England
,
where
the
climate
be
cold
,
and
the
air
eternally
load
with
vapour
;
and
where
,
of
consequence
,
the
builder
's
intention
should
be
to
keep
the
people
dry
and
warm
  
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
never
enter
the
Abbey
church
at
Bath
but
once
,
and
the
moment
I
stept
over
the
threshold
,
I
find
myself
chill
to
the
very
marrow
of
my
bone
  
<EOS>
when
we
consider
,
that
in
our
church
,
in
general
,
we
breathe
a
gross
stagnate
air
,
surcharge
with
damp
from
vault
,
tomb
,
and
charnel
-
house
<EOS>
,
may
we
not
term
them
so
many
magazine
of
rheum
,
create
for
the
benefit
of
the
medical
faculty
?
<EOS>
and
safety
aver
,
that
more
body
be
lose
,
than
soul
save
,
by
go
to
church
,
in
the
winter
especially
,
which
may
be
say
to
engross
eight
month
in
the
year
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
glad
to
know
,
what
offence
it
would
give
to
tender
conscience
,
if
the
house
of
God
be
make
more
comfortable
,
or
less
dangerous
to
the
health
of
valetudinarian
;
and
whether
it
would
not
be
an
encouragement
to
piety
,
as
well
as
the
salvation
of
many
life
,
if
the
place
of
worship
be
well
floor
,
wainscotte
,
warm
,
and
ventilate
,
and
its
area
keep
sacred
from
the
pollution
of
the
dead
.
<EOS>
the
practice
of
bury
in
church
be
the
effect
of
ignorant
superstition
,
influince
by
knavish
priest
,
who
pretend
that
the
devil
could
have
no
power
over
the
defunct

the
external
appearance
of
an
old
cathedral
can
not
be
but
displease
to
the
eye
of
every
man
who
have
any
idea
of
propriety
and
proportion
,
even
though
he
may
be
ignorant
of
architecture
as
a
science
;
and
the
long
slender
spire
put
one
in
mind
of
a
criminal
impale
,
with
a
sharp
stake
rise
up
through
his
shoulder
  
these
tower
,
or
steeple
,
be
likewise
borrow
from
the
Mahometans
who
,
have
no
bell
,
use
such
minaret
for
the
purpose
of
call
the
people
to
prayer
  
<EOS>
They
may
be
of
further
use

however

for
make
observation

signal

but
I
would
vote
for
their
be
distinct
from
the
body
of
the

because
they
serve
only
to
make
the

more
barbarous

Saracencial

<EOS>
there
be
nothing
of
this
arabic
architecture
in
the
assembly
Room
,
which
seem
to
me
to
have
be
build
upon
a
design
of
Palladio
,
and
may
be
convert
into
an
elegant
place
of
worship
;
but
it
be
indifferently
contrive
for
that
sort
of
idolatry
which
be
perform
in
it
at
present
:
the
grandeur
of
the
fane
give
a
diminutive
effect
to
the
little
paint
divinity
that
be
adore
in
it
,
and
and
company
,
on
a
ball
night
,
must
look
like
an
assembly
of
fantastic
fairy
,
revelling
by
moonlight
among
the

a

Scarborough
seem
to
be
fall
off

in
point
of
reputation
  
<EOS>
all
these

(
Bath

have
their
vogue

and
then
the

change
  
<EOS>
I
be
persuade
,
there
be
fifty
spaw
in
England
as
efficatious
and
salutary
as
that
of
Scarborough
,
though
they
have
not
yet
rise
to
fame
;
and
,
perhaps
,
never
will
,
<EOS>
unless
some
medical
encomiast
should
find
an
interest
in
display
their
virtue
to
the
public

be
that
as
it

recourse
will
always
be
have
to
this

for
the
convenience
of

it

they

I

You

be
go

He
intend
to

yesterday
morning

at
six
o'clock

I
go
down

I
rise

<EOS>
I
have
swam
out
a

stroke

when
hear
a
noise

I
turn
about
and
see
Clinker
,
already
up
to
his
neck
,
advance
towards
me
,
with
all
the
wildness
of
terror
in
his
aspect
  
<EOS>
Afraid
he
would
get
out
of
his
depth

I
make
haste
to
meet
him
,
when
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
he
seize
me
by
one
ear
,
and
drag
me
bellow
with
pain
upon
the
dry
beach

to
the
astonishment
of
all
the
people

man

woman

there
assemble

<EOS>
I
be
so
exasperate
by
the
pain
of
my
ear

and
the
disgrace
of
be
expose
in
such
an
attitude
,
that
,
in
the
first
transport
,
I
strike
him
down
;
then
,
run
back
into
the
sea
,
take
shelter
,
in
the
machine
where
my
clothe
have
be
deposit
.
<EOS>
I
soon
recollect
myself
so
far
as
to
do
justice
to
the
poor
fellow

who
,
in
great
simplicity
of
heart
,
have
act
from
motive
of
fidelity
and
affection
  
open
the
door
of
the
machine
,
which
be
immediately
draw
on
shore
,
I
see
him
stand
by
the
wheel
,
drop
like
a
water

work
,
and
tremble
from
head
to
foot
;
partly
from
cold
,
and
partly
from
the
dread
of
have
offend
his
master
  
<EOS>
I
make
my
acknowledgement
for
the
blow
he
have
receive
,
assure
him
I
be
not
angry
,
and
insist
upon
his
go
home
immediately
,
to
shift
his
clothe
:
a
command
which
he
could
hardly
find
in
his

to
execute

well
disposed
be
he
to
furnish
the

with
further
entertainment
at
my
expence

<EOS>
Clinker
's
intention
be
laudable
without
all
doubt

but
,
nevertheless
,
I
be
a
sufferer
by
his
simplicity
  
<EOS>
I
have
have
a
burning

heat

a
strange
buzzing
noise
in

ear

I

whether

in

he

him
out
naked

You

how

in
the

ebullition

he
knock
Clinker
down

<EOS>
in
this

by

a

which
he

and
a
few
tack
which
he
make
for
the
purpose
  
upon
the
whole
<EOS>
,
we
be
in
a
condition
to
proceed
in
a
little
more
than
one
hour
;
but
even
this
delay
oblige
us
to
pass
the
night
at
Gisborough
  
<EOS>
next
day
we
cross
the
Tees
at
Stockton
,
which
be
a
neat
agreeable
town
;
and
there
we
resolve
to
dine
,
with
purpose
to
lie
at
Durham
.
    
<EOS>
whom
should
we
meet
in
the
yard
,
when
we
alight
,
but
Martin
the
adventurer
?
<EOS>
have
hand
out
the
lady
,
and
conduct
them
into
an
apartment
,
where
he
pay
his
compliment
to
Mrs
Tabby
,
with
his
usual
address
,
he
beg
leave
to
speak
to
my
uncle
in
another
room
;
and
there
,
in
some
confusion
,
he
make
an
apology
for
have
take
the
liberty
to
trouble
him
with
a
letter
at
Stevenage
.
<EOS>
He
express
his
hope
,
that
Mr
Bramble
have
bestow
some
consideration
on
his
unhappy
case
,
and
repeat
his
desire
of
be
take
into
his
service
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
call
me
into
the
room
,
tell
him
,
that
we
be
both
very
well
inclined
to
rescue
him
from
a
way
of
life
that
be
equally
dangerous
and
dishonourable
;
and
that
he
should
have
no
scruple
in
trust
to
his
gratitude
and
fidelity
if
he
have
any
employment
for
him
,
which
he
think
would
suit
his
qualification
and
his
circumstance
;
but
that
all
the
department
he
have
mention
in
his
letter
,
be
fill
up
by
person
of
whose
conduct
he
have
no
reason
to
complain
;
of
consequence
he
could
not
,
without
injustice
,
deprive
any
one
of
them
of
his
bread
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
declare
himself
ready
to
assist
him
in
any
feasible
project
,
either
with
his
purse
or
credit
.
    
<EOS>
Martin
seem
deeply
touch
at
this
declaration
  
<EOS>
the
tear
start
in
his
eye
,
while
he
say
,
in
a
faultering
accent
  
<EOS>
"
worthy
sir
 
<EOS>
your
generosity
oppress
me
  
<EOS>
I
never
dream
of
trouble
you
for
any
pecuniary
assistance
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
have
no
occasion
  
<EOS>
I
have
be
so
lucky
at
billiard
and
bet
in
different
place
,
at
Buxton
Harrigate
,
Scarborough
,
and
Newcastle
race
,
that
my
stock
in
ready
-
money
amount
to
three
hundred
pound
,
which
I
would
willingly
employ
,
in
prosecute
some
honest
scheme
of
life
;
but
my
friend
,
justice
Buzzard
,
have
set
so
many
spring
for
my
life
,
that
I
be
under
the
necessity
of
either
retire
immediately
to
a
remote
part
of
the
country
,
where
I
can
enjoy
the
protection
of
some
generous
patron
,
or
of
quit
the
kingdom
altogether
  
<EOS>
It
be
upon
this
alternative
that
I
now
beg
leave
to
ask
your
advice
  
<EOS>
I
have
have
information
of
all
your
route
,
since
I
have
the
honour
to
see
you
at
stevenage
;
and
suppose
you
would
come
this
way
from
Scarborough
<EOS>
,
I
come
hither
last
night
from
Darlington
,
to
pay
you
my
respect
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
no
difficult
matter
to
provide
you
with
an
asylum
in
the
country
(
reply
my
uncle
;
)
but
a
life
of
indolence
and
obscurity
would
not
suit
with
your
active
and
enterprising
disposition
  
I
would
therefore
advise
you
to
try
your
fortune
in
the
East
Indies
  
I
will
give
you
a
letter
to
a
friend
in
London
,
who
will
recommend
you
to
the
direction
,
for
a
commission
in
the
company
's
service
;
and
if
that
can
not
be
obtain
,
you
will
at
least
be
receive
as
a
volunteer
 
in
which
case
,
you
may
pay
for
your
passage
,
and
I
shall
undertake
to
procure
you
such
credential
,
that
you
will
not
be
long
without
a
commission
.
"
    
<EOS>
Martin
embrace
the
proposal
with
great
eagerness
;
it
be
therefore
resolve
,
that
he
should
sell
his
horse
,
and
take
a
passage
by
sea
for
London
,
to
execute
the
project
without
delay
  
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
he
accompany
us
to
Durham
,
where
we
take
up
our
quarter
for
that
night
  
here
,
be
furnish
with
letter
from
my
uncle
,
he
take
his
leave
of
us
,
with
strong
symptom
of
gratitude
and
attachment
,
and
set
out
for
Sunderland
,
in
order
to
embark
in
the
first
collier
,
bind
for
the
river
Thames
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
go
half
an
hour
,
when
we
be
join
by
another
character
,
which
promise
something
extraordinary
  
a
tall
,
meager
figure
,
answer
,
with
his
horse
,
the
description
of
Don
Quixote
mount
on
Rozinante
,
appear
in
the
twilight
at
the
inn
door
,
while
my
aunt
and
Liddy
stand
at
a
window
in
the
dining
-
room
  
<EOS>
He
wear
a
coat
,
the
cloth
of
which
have
once
be
scarlet
,
trim
with
Brandenburgs
,
not
totally
deprive
of
their
metal
,
and
he
have
holster
-
cap
and
housing
of
the
same
stuff
and
same
antiquity
.
<EOS>
perceive
lady
at
the
window
above
he
endeavour
to
dismount
with
the
most
graceful
air
he
could
assume
;
but
the
ostler
neglect
to
hold
the
stirrup
when
he
wheel
off
his
right
foot
,
and
stand
with
his
whole
weight
on
the
other

the
girth
unfortunately
give
way
,
the

turn
,
<EOS>
down
come
the
cavalier
to
the
ground
,
and
his
hat
and
periwig
fall
off
,
display
a
head
-
piece
of
various
colour
,
patch
and
plaistere
in
a
woeful
condition
  
<EOS>
the
lady
,
at
the
window
above
,
shriek
with
affright
,
on
the
supposition
that
the
stranger
have
receive
some
notable
damage
in
his
fall
;
but
the
great
injury
he
have
sustain
arise
from
the
dishonour
of
his
descent
,
aggravate
by
the
disgrace
of
expose
the
condition
of
his
cranium
;
for
certain
plebeian
that
be
about
the
door
,
laugh
aloud
,
in
the
belief
that
the
captain
have
get
either
a
seald
head
,
or
a
broken
head
,
both
equaily
opprobrious
.
    
<EOS>
He
forthwith
leap
up
in
a
fury
,
and
snatch
one
of
his
pistol
,
threaten
to
put
the
ostler
to
death
,
when
another
squall
from
the
woman
check
his
resentment
.
<EOS>
He
then
bow
to
the
window
,
while
he
kiss
the
butt
-
end
of
his
pistol
,
which
he
replace
;
adjust
his
wig
in
great
confusion
,
and
lead
his
horse
into
the
stable
  
by
this
time
I
have
come
to
the
door
,
and
could
not
help
gaze
at
the
strange
figure
that
present
itself
to
my
view
  
<EOS>
He
would
have
measure
above
six
foot
in
height
,
have
he
stand
upright
;
but
he
stoop
very
much
;
be
very
narrow
in
the
shoulder
,
and
very
thick
in
the
calf
of
his
leg
,
which
be
case
in
black
spatterdashe
  
as
for
his
thigh
,
they
be
long
and
slend
,
like
those
of
a
grasshopper
;
his
face
be
,
at
least
,
half
a

in
length
,
brown
and
shrivel

with
project
cheek

little

,
very
ill

,
and
a
high

narrow

-
head
,
well
furrowed
with
wrinkle
.
<EOS>
His
horse
be
exactly
in
the
stile
of
its
rider
;
a
resurrection
of
dry
bone
,
which
(
as
we
afterwards
learn
)
<EOS>
he
value
exceedingly
,
as
the
only
present
he
have
ever
receive
in
his
life
.
    
<EOS>
have
see
this
favourite
steed
properly

he
send
up
his
compliment
to

beg
permission
to

of

in

much
formality

<EOS>
perhaps
ye

be
scandaleeze
at
the
appearance

by
accident

but
I
can
assure
you
,
the
condition
you
see
it
in

be
neither
the
effect
of
disease

nor
of
drunkenness

but
an
honest

the
service
of
my
country

"
<EOS>
He
then
give
us
to
understand
,
that
have
be
wound
at
Ticonderoga
,
in
America
,
a
party
of
Indians
rifle
him
,
scalp
him
,
break
his
scull
with
the
blow
of
a
tomahawk
,
and
leave
him
for
dead
on
the
field
of
battle
;
but
that
be
afterwards
find
with
sign
of
life
,
he
have
be
cure
in
the
french
hospital

though
the
loss
of
substance
could
not
be

;
so
that
the
scull
be
leave
naked
in
several
place
,
and
these
he
cover
with
patch
.
    
<EOS>
there
be
no
hold
by
which
an
Englishman
be
sooner
take
than
that
of
compassion
  
<EOS>
We
be
immediately
interested
in
behalf
of
this
veteran
  
<EOS>
even
Tabby
's
heart
be
melt
;
but
our
pity
be
warm
with
indignation
,
when
we
learn
,
that
in
the
course
of
two
sanguinary
war
,
he
have
be
wound
,
maim
,
mutilate
,
take
,
and
enslave
,
without
ever
have
attain
a
high
rank
than
that
of
lieutenant
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
's
eye
gleam
,
and
his
nether
lip
quiver
,
while
he
exclaim
,
"
I
vow
to
God
,
sir

your

a
reproach
to

the

"
I
must
crave
your
pardon
,
sir

(
cry
the
other

him
)
<EOS>
I
complain
of
no
injustice
  
<EOS>
I
purchase
an
ensigncy
thirty
year
ago
;

,
in
the
course
of
service
,
rise
to
be
a
lieutenant

accord
to
my
seniority
 
"
<EOS>
"
but
in
such
a
length
of
time
,
(
resume
the
"
squire
)
<EOS>
you
must
have
see
a
great
many
young

put
over

nevertheless
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
I
have
no
cause
to

<EOS>
They
buy
their
preferment
with
their

<EOS>
I
have
no
money
to
carry
to

that
be
my
misfortune

nobody
be

<EOS>
"

what

<EOS>
no

advance
a
sum
of
money

<EOS>
"
(
say
Mr
Bramble

)
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
I
may
have
borrow
money
for
the
purchase
of
a
company
(
answer
the
other
;

but
that
loan
must
have
be
refund

I
do
not
choose

so
you

cry
Mr

your

your

,
and
your
constitution
,
amidst
the
danger

the
difficulty

the
horror

of

for

of
three

"
Sir

(
reply
the
Scot
,
with
great
warmth

<EOS>
you
be
the
man
that
do
me
injustice

if
you
say
or
think
I
have
be
actuate
by
any
such
paultry
consideration
  
<EOS>
I
be
a
gentleman
;
and
enter
the
service
as
other
gentleman
do
,
with
such
hope
and
sentiment
as
honourable
ambition
inspire
  
if
I
have
not
be
lucky
in
the
lottery
of
life
,
so
neither
do
I
think
myself
unfortunate
  
<EOS>
I
owe
no
man
a
farthing
;
I
can
always
command
a
clean
shirt
,
a
mutton
-
chop
,
and
a
truss
of
straw
;
and
when
I
die
,
I
shall
leave
effect
sufficient
to
defray
the
expence
of
my
burial
.

<EOS>
My
uncle
assure
him
,
he
have
no
intention
to
give
him
the
least
offence
,
by
the
observation
he
have
make
;
but
on
the
contrary
,
speak
from
a
sentiment
of
friendly
regard
to
his
interest
  
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
thank
him
with
a
stiffness
of
civility
,
which
nettle
our
old
gentleman
,
who
perceive
that
his
moderation
be
all
affected
;
for
,
whatsoever
his
tongue
may
declare
,
his
whole
appearance
denote
dissatisfaction
  
<EOS>
in
short
without
pretend
to
judge
of
his
military
merit
,
I
think
I
may
affirm
,
that
this
Caledonian
be
a
self
-
conceite
pedant
,
aukward
,
rude
,
and
disputacious
  
<EOS>
He
have
have
the
benefit
of
a
school
-
education
,
seem
to
have
read
a
good
number
of
book
,
his
memory
be
tenacious
,
and
he
pretend
to
speak
several
different
language
;
but
he
be
so
addicted
to
wrangle
,
that
he
will
cavil
at
the
clear
truth
,
and
,
in
the
pride
of
argumentation
,
attempt
to
reconcile
contradiction
  
whether
his
address
and
qualification
be
really
of
that
stamp
which
be
agreeable
to
the
taste
of
our
aunt
,
Mrs
Tabitha
,
or
that
indefatigable
maiden
be
determined
to
shoot
at
every
sort
of
game
,
<EOS>
certain
it
be
she
have
begin
to
practise
upon
the
heart
of
the
lieutenant
,
who
favour
us
with
his
company
to
supper
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
many
other
thing
to
say
of
this
man
of
war
,
which
I
shall
communicate
in
a
post
or
two
;
<EOS>
mean
<EOS>
while
,
it
be
but
reasonable
that
you
should
be
indulge
with
some
respite
from

weary
lucubration

<EOS>

Sir
Watkin
Phillips

Bart%

Oxon

<EOS>
dear
phillips
,
in
my
last
I
treat
you
with
a
high
flavour
dish
,
in
the
character
of
the
Scotch
lieutenant
,
and
I
must
present
him
once
more
for
your
entertainment
.
<EOS>
It
be
our
fortune
to
feed
upon
him
the
good
part
of
three
day
;
and
I
do
not
doubt
that
he
will
start
again
in
our
way
before
we
shall
have
finish
our
northern
excursion
.
<EOS>
the
day
after
our
meeting
with
him
at
Durham
prove
so
tempestuous
that
we
do
not
choose
to
proceed
on
our
journey
;
and
my
uncle
persuade
him
to
stay
till
the
weather
should
clear
up
,
give
him
,
at
the
same
time
,
a
general
invitation
to
our
mess
.
<EOS>
the
man
have
certainly
gather
a
whole
budget
of
shrewd
observation
,
but
he
bring
them
forth
in
such
an
ungracious
manner
as
would
be
extremely
disgusting
,
if
it
be
not
mark
by
that
characteristic
oddity
which
never

such

an

Mr

Mrs

You

it

<EOS>
this
genealogical
anecdote
seem
to
make
some
impression
upon
the
North

Briton
,
who
bow
very
low
to
the
descendant
of

and
observe
that
he
himself

<EOS>
the

express
a
desire
of
know
his

he

,
he
sign
himself
Lieutenant

in

he
present
her

He
likewise
drop
some
hint
about

with

Mrs

do
not
fail
to
compliment
him
on
his
modesty
in
wave
the
merit

<EOS>
add
that
it

he
have
such
a
considerable
fund
of

<EOS>
She
now
begin
to
glew
herself
to
his
favour
with
the
gross
adulation

She
expatiate
upon

<EOS>
She
appeal
to
her

whether
the

<EOS>
She
discover
a
surprizing
eagerness

ask

thousand
question
concern

all

Mr

affect
a
reluctance

curiosity
on

<EOS>
by
dint
of
her
interrogation

however
,
we
learn

that
he

Murphy
have
make
their
escape
from
the
french
hospital
at
Montreal
,
and
take
to
the
wood
,
in
hope
of
reach
some
english
settlement

but
mistake
their
route
,
they
fall
in
with
a
party
of
Miamis

who
carry
them
away
in
captivity
.
<EOS>
the
intention
of
these
Indians
be
to
give
one
of
them
as
an
adopt
son
to
a
venerable
sachem
,
who
have
lose
his

Murphy

his

in

through

<EOS>
such
be
the
out

line
of
Mr

's
history
,
to
which
Tabitha
do
seriously
incline
her

;
 
indeed
<EOS>

she
seem
to
be
take
with
the

charm
that

the
heart
of

who

<EOS>
the
description
of
poor
Murphy
's
suffering
,
which
throw
my
sister
Liddy
into
a
swoon
,
extract
some
sigh
from
the
breast
of
Mrs
Tabby
:
when
she
understand
he
have
be
render
unfit
for
marriage
,
she
begin
to
spit
,
and
ejaculate
,
"
Jesus
,
what
cruel
barbarian
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
make
wry
face
at
the
lady
's
nuptial
repast
;
but
she
be
eagerly
curious
to
know
the
particular
of
her
marriage
-
dress
;
whether
she
wear
high
breast
stay
or
boddice
,
a
robe
of
silk
or
velvet
,
and
lace
of
Mechlin
or

<EOS>
she
suppose

as
the
be
connect
with
the
French
,
she
use
rouge
,
and
have
her
hair
dress
in
the
parisian
fashion
.
<EOS>
the
captain
would
have
decline
give
a
categorical
explanation
of
all
these
particular
,
observe
,
in
general
,
that
the
Indians
be
too
tenacious
of
their
own
custom
to
adopt
the
mode
of
any
nation
whatsoever
:
he
say
,
moreover
,
that
neither
the
simplicity
of
their
manner
,
nor
the
commerce
of
their
country
,
would
admit
of
those
article
of
luxury
which
be
deem
magnificence
in
Europe
;
and
that
they
be
too
virtuous
and
sensible
to
encourage
the
introduction
of
any
fashion
which
may
help
to
render
them
corrupt
and
effeminate
.
    
<EOS>
these
observation
serve
only
to
inflame
her
desire
of
know
the
particular
about
which
she
have
enquire
;
and
,
with
all
his
evasion
,
he
could
not
help
discover
the
follow
circumstance
 
that
his
princess
have
neither
shoe
,
stocking
,
shift
,
nor
any
kind
of
linen
 
that
her
bridal

of
a

and
a

<EOS>
one
would
imagine
that
these
paraphernalia
would
not

be
much
admire
by
a
modern
fine

Mrs

be
resolve
to
approve
of
all

connection

<EOS>
She
wish
,
indeed
,
the
squaw
have
be
better
provide
with
linen
;
but
she
own
there
be
much
taste
and
fancy
in
her
ornament

she
make
no
doubt
,
therefore
,
that
madam
Squinkinacoosta
be
a
young
lady
of
good
sense
and
rare
accomplishment
,
and
a
good
christian
at

<EOS>
when
he
confess
that
she

be
utter
stranger

she

after

"

two

when

talk
of
mystery

revelation
,
which
they
could
neither
explain
nor
authenticate
,
and
call
in
the
evidence
of
miracle
which
they

when
they

to

God

revive

and
multiply
him
ad

by
the

the
Indians
be
shock
at
the
impiety
of
their
presumption
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
examine
by
the
assembly
of
the
sachem
,
who
desire
them
to
prove
the
divinity
of
their
mission
by
some
miracle
.
  
<EOS>
They
answer
,
that
it
be
not
in
their
power
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
really
send
by
Heaven
for
our
conversion
,
(
say
one
of
the
sachem
)
<EOS>
you
would
certainly
have
some
supernatural
endowment
,
at
least
you
would
have
the
gift
of
tongue
,
in
order
to
explain
your
doctrine
;
to
the
different
nation
among
which
you
be
employ
;
but
you
be
so
ignorant
of
our
language
that
you
can
not
express
yourself
even
on
the
most
trifling
subject
.
"
    
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
the
assembly
be
convince
of
their
be
cheat
,
and
even
suspect
them
of
be
spy
:
  
<EOS>
They
order
them
a
bag
of
indian
corn
a
-
piece
,
and
apointe
a
guide
to
conduct
them
to
the
frontier
;
but
the
millionaire
have
more
zeal
than
discretion
,
refuse
to
quit
the
vineyard
.
  
<EOS>
They
persist
in
say
mass
,
in
preaching
,
baptizing
,
and
squabble
with
the
conjurer
,
or
priest
of
the
country
,
till
they
have
throw
the
whole
community
into
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
then
the
assembly
proceed
to
try
them
as
impious
impostor
,
who
represent
the
Almighty
as
a
trifling
,
weak
,
capricious
being
,
and
pretend
to
make
,
unmake
,
and
reproduce
him
at
pleasure
:
they
be
,
therefore
,
convict
of
blasphemy
and
sedition
,
and
condemn
to
the
stake
,
where
they
die
singe
salve
regina
,
in
a
rapture
of
joy
,
for
the
crown
of
martyrdom
which
they
have
thus
obtain
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
this
conversation
,
lieutenant
Lismahago
dropt
some
hint
by
which
it
appear
he
himself
be
a
free
-
thinker
.
<EOS>
Our
aunt
seem
to
be
startle
at
certain
sarcasm
he
throw
out
against
the
creed
of
saint
Athanasius
.
  
<EOS>
He
dwell
much
upon
the
word
,
reason
,
philosophy
,
and
contradiction
in
term
 
he
bid
defiance
to
the
eternity
of
hell
-
fire
;
and
even
throw
such
squibs
at
the
immortality
of
the
soul
,
as
singe
a
little
the
whisker
of
Mrs
Tabitha
's
faith
;
for
,
by
this
time
,
she
begin
to
look
upon
Lismahago
as
a
prodigy
of
learning
and
sagacity
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
could
be
no
longer
insensible
to
the
advance
she
make
towards
his
affection
;
and
although
there
be
something
repulsive
in
his
nature
,
he
overcome
it
so
far
as
to
make
some
return
to
her
civility
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
,
he
think
it
would
be
no
bad
scheme
,
in
a
superannuated
lieutenant
on
half
-
pay
,
to
effect
a
conjunction
with
an
old
maid
,
who
,
in
all
probability
,
have
fortune
enough
to
keep
him
easy
and
comfortable
in
the
fag
-
end
of
his
day
.
  
<EOS>
an
ogle
correspondence
forthwith
commence
between
this
amiable
pair
of
original
.
  
<EOS>
He
begin
to
sweeten
the
natural
accidity
of
his
discourse
with
the
treacle
of
compliment
and
commendation
.
  
<EOS>
He
from
time
to
time
offer
her
snuff
,
of
which
he
himself
take
great
quantity
,
and
even
make
her
a
present
of
a
purse
of
silk
grass
,
weave
by
the
hand
of
the
amiable
Squinkinacoosta
,
who
have
use
it
as
a
shot
-
pouch
in
her
hunting
-
expedition
.
    
<EOS>
from
Doncaster
northward
,
all
the
window
of
all
the
inn
be
scrawl
with
doggrel
rhime
,
in
abuse
of
the
Scotch
nation
;
and
what
surprise
me
very
much
,
I
do
not
perceive
one
line
write
in
the
way
of
recrimination
  
<EOS>
curious
to
hear
what
Lismahago
would
say
on
this
subject
<EOS>
,
I
point
out
to
him
a
very
scurrilous
epigram
against
his
countryman
,
which
be
engrave
on
one
of
the
window
of
the
parlour
where
we
sit
.
  
<EOS>
He
read
it
with
the
most
starched
composure
;
and
when
I
ask
his
opinion
of
the
poetry
,
"
It
be
vara
terse
and
vara
poignant
(
he
say
)
;
but
with
the
help
of
a
wat
dish
-
clout
it
may
be
render
more
clear
and
parspicous
.
  
<EOS>
I
marvel
much
that
some
modern
wit
have
not
publish
a
collection
of
these
essay
under
the
title
of
the
Glazier
's
Triumph
over
Sawney
the
Scot
  
<EOS>
I
be
persuade
it
would
be
a
vara
agreeable
offering
to
the
patriot
of
London
and
Westminster
.
<EOS>
"
when
I
express
some
surprize
that
the
native
of
Scotland
,
who
travel
this
way
,
have
not
break
all
the
window
upon
the
road
,
"
with
submission
,
(
reply
the
lieutenant
)
<EOS>
that
be
but
<EOS>
shallow
policy
 
<EOS>
it
would
only
serve
to
make
the
satire
more
cutting
and
severe
;
and
,
I
think
,
it
be
much
well
to
let
it
stand
in
the
window
,
than
have
it
present
in
the
reckoning
.
"
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
's
jaw
begin
to
quiver
with
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
the
scribbler
of
such
infamous
stuff
deserve
to
be
scourge
at
the
cart
's
tail
for
disgrace
their
country
with
such
monument
of
malice
and
stupidity
.
  
<EOS>
"
these
vermin
(
say
he
)
do
not
consider
,
that
they
be
afford
their
fellow
-
subject
,
whom
they
abuse
,
continual
matter
of
self
-
gratulation
,
as
well
as
the
mean
of
execute
the
most
manly
vengeance
that
can
be
take
for
such
low
,
illiberal
attack
.
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
admire
the
philosophic
forbearance
of
the
Scots
,
as
much
as
I
despise
the
insolence
of
those
wretched
libeller
,
which
be
a
kin
to
the
arrogance
of
the
village
cock
,
who
never
crow
but
upon
his
own
dunghill
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
captain
,
with
an
affectation
of
candour
,
observe
,
that
man
of
illeberal
mind
be
produce
in
every
soil
;
that
in
suppose
those
be
the
sentiment
of
the
English
in
general
,
he
should
pay
too
great
a
compliment
to
his
own
country
,
which
be
not
of
consequence
enough
to
attract
the
envy
of
such
a
flourishing
and
powerful
people
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabby
break
forth
again
in
praise
of
his
moderation
,
and
declare
that
Scotland
be
the
soil
which
produce
every
virtue
under
heaven
.
  
<EOS>
when
Lismahago
take
his
leave
for
the
night
,
she
ask
her
brother
if
the
captain
be
not
the
prettiest
gentleman
he
have
ever
see
;
and
whether
there
be
not
something
wonderfully
engage
in
his
aspect
?
  
<EOS>
Mr
Bramble
have
eye
her
some
time
in
silence
,
"
Sister
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
be
,
for
aught
I
know
,
an
honest
man
,
and
a
good
officer
 
he
have
a
considerable
share
of
understanding
,
and
a
title
to
more
encouragement
than
he
seem
to
have
meet
with
in
life
;
but
I
can
not
,
with
a
safe
conscience
,
affirm
,
that
he
be
the
prettiest
gentleman
I
ever
see
;
neither
can
I
discern
any
engage
charm
in
his
countenance
,
which
,
I
vow
to
Gad
,
be
,
on
the
contrary
,
very
hard
favour
and
forbidding
.
"
    
<EOS>
I
have
endeavour
to
ingratiate
myself
with
this
North
-
Briton
,
who
be
really
a
curiosity
;
but
he
have
be
very
shy
of
my
conversation
ever
since
I
laugh
at
his
asserting
that
the
english
tongue
be
speak
with
more
propriety
at
Edinburgh
than
at
London
.
<EOS>
look
at
me
with
a
double
squeeze
of
souring
in
his
aspect
,
"
if
the
old
definition
be
true
,
(
say
he
)
that
risibility
be
the
distinguish
characteristic
of
a
rational
creature
,
the
English
be
the
most
distinguished
for
rationality
of
any
people
I
ever
know
.
<EOS>
"
I
own
that
the
English
be
easily
strike
with
any
thing
that
appear
ludicrous
,
and
apt
to
laugh
accordingly
;
but
it
do
not
follow
,
that
,
because
they
be
more
give
to
laughter
,
they
have
more
rationality
than
their
neighbour
:
I
say
,
such
an
inference
would
be
an
injury
to
the
Scots
,
who
be
by
no
mean
defective
in
rationality
,
though
generally
suppose
little
subject
to
the
impression
of
humour
.
    
<EOS>
the
captain
answer
,
that
this
supposition
must
have
be
deduce
either
from
their
conversation
or
their
composition
,
of
which
the
English
could
not
possibly
judge
with
precision
,
as
they
do
not
understand
the
dialect
use
by
the
Scots
in
common
discourse
,
as
well
as
in
their
work
of
humour
.
<EOS>
when
I
desire
to
know
that
those
work
of
humour
be
,
he
mention
a
considerable
number
of
piece
,
which
he
insist
be
equal
in
point
of
humour
to
any
thing
extant
in
any
language
dead
or
living
.
  
<EOS>
He
,
in
particular
,
recommend
a
collection
of
detached
poem
,
in
two
small
volume
,
intitule
,
the
ever
-
green
,
and
the
work
of
Allan
Ramsay
,
which
I
intend
to
provide
myself
with
at
Edinburgh
.
  
<EOS>
He
observe
,
that
a
North
-
Briton
be
see
to
a
disadvantage
in
an
english
company
,
because
he
speak
in
a
dialect
that
they
can
not
relish
,
and
in
a
phraseology
which
they
do
not
understand
.
  
<EOS>
He
therefore
find
himself
under
a
restraint
,
which
be
a
great
enemy
to
wit
and
humour
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
faculty
which
never
appear
in
full
lustre
,
but
when
the
mind
be
perfectly
at
ease
,
and
,
as
an
excellent
writer
say
,
enjoy
her
elbow
-
room
.
    
<EOS>
He
proceed
to
explain
his
assertion
that
the
english
language
be
speak
with
great
propriety
at
Edinburgh
than
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
what
we
generally
call
the
scottish
dialect
be
,
in
fact
,
true
,
genuine
old
English
,
with
a
mixture
of
some
french
term
and
idiom
,
adopt
in
a
long
intercourse
betwixt
the
french
and
Scotch
nation
;
that
the
modern
English
,
from
affectation
and
false
refinement
,
have
weaken
,
and
even
corrupt
their
language
,
by
throw
out
the
guttural
sound
,
alter
the
pronounciation
and
the
quantity
,
and
disuse
many
word
and
term
of
great
significance
.
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
these
innovation
,
the
work
of
our
good
poet
,
such
as
Chaucer
,
Spenser
,
and
even
Shakespeare
,
be
become
,
in
many
part
,
unintelligible
to
the
native
of
South
-
Britain
,
whereas
the
Scots
,
who
retain
the
ancient
language
,
understand
them
without
the
help
of
a
glossary
.
"
<EOS>
for
instance
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
how
have
your
commentator
be
puzzle
by
the
follow
expression
in
the
temp
 
<EOS>
He
be
gentle
and
not
fearful
;
as
if
it
be
a
paralogism
to
say
,
that
be
gentle
,
he
must
of
course
be
courageous
:
but
the
truth
be
,
one
of
the
original
meaning
if
not
the
sole
meaning
,
of
that
word
be
,
noble
,
high
-
minded
;
and
to
this
day
a
Scotch
woman
,
in
the
situation
of
the
young
lady
in
the
temp
,
would
express
herself
nearly
in
the
same
term
 
do
not
provoke
him
;
for
be
gentle
,
that
be
high
spirited
,
he
will
not
tamely
bear
an
insult
.
<EOS>
Spenser
,
in
the
very
first
stanza
of
his
Fairy
Queen
,
say
,
"
    
"
a
gentle
knight
be
prick
on
the
plain
;
"
"
which
knight
,
far
from
be
tame
and
fearful
,
be
so
stout
that
"
"
nothing
do
he
dread
,
but
ever
be
ydrad
.
"
    
<EOS>
to
prove
that
we
have
impair
the
energy
of
our
language
by
false
refinement
,
he
mention
the
follow
word
,
which
,
though
widely
different
in
signification
,
be
pronounce
exactly
in
the
same
manner
 
wright
,
write
,
right
,
rite
;
but
among
the
Scots
,
these
word
be
as
different
in
pronunciation
,
as
they
be
in
meaning
and
orthography
;
and
this
be
the
case
with
many
other
which
he
mention
by
way
of
illustration
.
  
<EOS>
He
,
moreover
,
take
notice
that
we
have
(
for
what
reason
he
could
never
learn
)
alter
the
sound
of
our
vowel
from
that
which
be
retain
by
all
the
nation
in
Europe
;
an
alteration
which
render
the
language
extremely
difficult
to
foreigner
,
and
make
it
almost
impractible
to
lay
down
general
rule
for
orthography
and
pronunciation
.
<EOS>
besides
,
the
vowel
be
no
longer
simple
sound
in
the
mouth
of
an
Englishman
,
who
pronounce
both
i
and
u
as
diphthong
.
<EOS>
(
finally
,
he
affirm
,
that
we
mumble
our
speech
with
our
lip
and
tooth
,
and
run
the
word
together
without
pause
or
distinction
,
in
such
a
manner
that
a
foreigner
,
though
he
understand
English
tolerably
well
,
be
often
oblige
to
have
recourse
to
a
Scotchman
to
explain
what
a
native
of
England
have
say
in
his
own
language
.
    
<EOS>
the
truth
of
this
remark
be
confirm
by
Mr
Bramble
from
his
own
experience
;
but
he
account
for
it
on
another
principle
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
the
same
observation
would
hold
in
all
language
;
that
a
Swiss
talk
French
be
more
easily
understand
than
a
Parisian
,
by
a
foreigner
who
have
not
make
himself
master
of
the
language
;
because
every
language
have
its
peculiar
recitative
,
and
it
would
always
require
more
pain
,
attention
,
and
practice
,
to
acquire
both
the
word
and
the
music
,
than
to
learn
the
word
only
;
and
yet
no
body
would
deny
,
that
the
one
be
imperfect
without
the
other
!
<EOS>
he
therefore
apprehend
,
that
the
Scotchman
and
the
Swiss
be
better
understand
by
learner
,
because
they
speak
the
word
only
,
without
the
music
,
which
they
could
not
rehearse
.
<EOS>
one
would
imagine
this
check
may
have
damp
the
North
-
Briton
;
but
it
serve
only
to
agitate
his
humour
for
disputation
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
if
every
nation
have
its
own
recitative
or
music
,
the
Scots
have
theirs
,
and
the
Scotchman
who
have
not
yet
acquire
the
cadence
of
the
English
,
would
naturally
use
his
own
in
speak
their
language
;
therefore
,
if
he
be
better
understand
than
the
native
,
his
recitative
must
be
more
intelligible
than
that
of
the
English
;
of
consequence
the
dialect
of
the
Scots
have
an
advantage
over
that
of
their
fellow
-
subject
,
and
this
be
another
strong
presumption
that
the
modern
English
have
corrupt
their
language
in
the
article
of
pronunciation
.
    
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
be
,
by
this
time

become
so
polemical

that
every
time
he
open
his
mouth
out
fly
a
paradox
,
which
he
maintain
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
altercation
;
but
all
his
paradox
favour
strong
of
a
partiality
for
his
own
country
.
<EOS>
He
undertake
to
prove
that
poverty
be
a
blessing
to
a
nation
;
that
oatmeal
be
preferable
to
wheat
-
flour
;
and
that
the
worship
of
Cloacina
,
in
temple
which
admit
both
sex
,
and
every
rank
of
votary
promiscuously
,
be
a
filthy
specie
of
idolatry
that
outrage
every
idea
of
delicacy
and
decorum
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
so
much
wonder
at
his
broach
these
doctrine
,
as
at
the
argument
,
equally
whimsical
and
ingenious
,
which
he
adduce
in
support
of
them
.
    
<EOS>
in
fine
,
lieutenant
Lismahago
be
a
curiosity
which
I
have
not
yet
sufficiently
peruse
;
and
therefore
I
shall
be
sorry
when
we
lose
his
company
,
though
<EOS>
,
God
know
,
there
be
nothing
very
amiable
in
his
manner
or
disposition
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
go
directly
to
the
south
-
west
division
of
Scotland
,
and
we
proceed
in
the
road
to
Berwick
,
we
shall
part
to
-
morrow
at
a
place
call
Felton
-
bridge
;
and
,
I
dare
say
,
this
separation
will
be
very
grievous
to
our
aunt
Mrs
Tabitha
,
unless
she
have
receive
some
flattering
assurance
of
his
meeting
her
again
.
<EOS>
if
I
fail
in
my
purpose

entertain
you
with
these
unimportant

<EOS>
DEAR
DOCTOR
,
I
have
now
reach
the
northern
extremity
of
England
,
and
see
,
close
to
my
chamber
-
window
,
the
Tweed
glide
through
the
arch
of
that
bridge
which
connect
this
suburb
to
the
town
of
Berwick
.
  
<EOS>
yorkshire
you
have
see
,
and
therefore
I
shall
say
nothing
of
that
opulent
province
.
<EOS>
the
city
of
Durham
appear
like
a
confused
heap
of
stone
and
brick
,
accumulate
so
as
to
cover
a
mountain
,
round
which
a
river
wind
its
brawling
course
.
<EOS>
the
street
be
generally
narrow
,
dark
,
and
unpleasant
,
and
many
of
them
almost
impassible
in
consequence
of
their
declivity
.
<EOS>
the
cathedral
be
a
huge
gloomy
pile
;
but
the
clergy
be
well
lodged
.
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
live
in
a
princely
manner
 
<EOS>
the
golden
prebend
keep
plentiful
table
 
<EOS>
and
,
I
be
tell
,
there
be
some
good
sociable
company
in
the
place
;
but
the
country
,
when
view
from
the
top
of
Gateshead
Fell
,
which
extend
to
Newcastle
,
exhibit
the
high
scene
of
cultivation
that
ever
I
beheld
.
<EOS>
as
for
Newcastle
,
it
lie
mostly
in
a
bottom
,
on
the
bank
of
the
Tyne
,
and
make
an
appearance
still
more
disagreeable
than
that
of
Durham
;
but
it
be
render
populous
and
rich
by
industry
and
commerce
;
and
the
country
lie
on
both
side
the
river
,
above
the
town
,
yield
a
delightful
prospect
of
agriculture
and
plantation
.
<EOS>
Morpeth
and
Alnwick
be
neat
,
pretty
town
,
and
this
last
be
famous
for
the
castle
which
have
belong
so
many
age
to
the
noble
house
of
Piercy
,
earl
of
Northumberland
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
,
doubtless
,
a
large
edifice
,
contain
a
great
number
of
apartment
,
and
stand
in
a
command
situation
;
but
the
strength
of
it
seem
to
have
consist
not
so
much
in
its
site
,
or
the
manner
in
which
it
be
fortify
,
as
in
the
valour
of
its
defendant
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventure
since
we
leave
Scarborough
,
be
scarce
worth
recite
;
and
yet
I
must
make
you
acquaint
with
my
sister
Tabby
's
progress
in
husband
-
hunting
,
after
her
disappointment
at
Bath
and
London
.
<EOS>
She
have
actually
begin
to
practise
upon
a
certain
adventurer
,
who
be
in
fact
a
highwayman
by
profession
;
but
he
have
be
use
to
snare
much
more
dangerous
than
any
she
could
lay
,
and
escape
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
then
she
open
her
battery
upon
an
old
weather
-
beat
Scotch
lieutenant
,
call
Lismahago
,
who
join
us
at
Durham
,
and
be
,
I
think
,
one
of
the
most
singular
personage
I
ever
encounter
.
  
<EOS>
His
manner
be
as
harsh
as
his
countenance
;
but
his
peculiar
turn
of
thinking
,
and
his
pack
of
knowledge
make
up
of
the
remnant
of
rarietie
,
render
his
conversation
desirable
,
in
spite
of
his
pedantry
and
ungracious
address
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
often
meet
with
a
crab
-
apple
in
a
hedge
,
which
I
have
be
tempt
to
eat
for
its
flavour
,
even
while
I
be
disgust
by
its
austerity
.
<EOS>
the
spirit
of
contradiction
be
naturally
so
strong
in
Lismahago
,
that
I
believe
in
my
conscience
he
have
rummage
,
and
read
,
and
study
with
indefatigable
attention
,
in
order
to
qualify
himself
to
refute
establish
maxims
,
and
thus
raise
trophy
for
the
gratification
of
polemical
pride
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
asperity
of
self
-
conceit
,
that
he
will
not
even
acquiesce
in
a
transient
compliment
make
to
his
own
individual
in
particular
,
or
to
his
country
in
general
.
    
<EOS>
when
I
observe
,
that
he
must
have
read
a
vast
number
of
book
to
be
able
to
discourse
on
such
a
variety
of
subject
,
he
declare
he
have
read
little
or
nothing
,
and
ask
how
he
should
find
book
among
the
wood
of
America
,
where
he
have
spend
the
great
part
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
My
nephew
remark
that
the
Scots
in
general
be
famous
for
their
learning
,
he
deny
the
imputation
,
and
defy
him
to
prove
it
from
their
work
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
Scots
(
say
he
)
have
a
slight
tincture
of
letter
,
with
which
they
make
a
parade
among
people
who
be
more
illiterate
than
themselves
;
but
they
may
be
say
to
float
on
the
surface
of
science
,
and
they
have
make
very
small
advance
in
the
useful
art
.
"
<EOS>
"
at
least
,
(
cry
Tabby
)
<EOS>
all
the
world
allow
that
the
Scots
behave
gloriously
in
fighting
and
conquer
the
savage
of
America
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
can
assure
you
,
madam
,
you
have
be
misinform
(
reply
the
lieutenant
)
;
in
that
continent
the
Scots
do
nothing
more
than
their
duty
,
nor
be
there
one
corps
in
his
majesty
's
service
that
distinguish
itself
more
than
another
.
  
<EOS>
those
who
affect
to
extol
the
Scots
for
superior
merit
,
be
no
friend
to
that
nation
.
"
    
<EOS>
though
he
himself
make
free
with
his
countryman
,
he
would
not
suffer
any
other
person
to
glance
a
sarcasm
at
them
with
impunity
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
company
chance
to
mention
lord
B
<EOS>
#
#
#
#
's
inglorious
peace
,
the
lieutenant
immediately
take
up
the
cudgel
in
his
lordship
's
favour
,
and
argue
very
strenuously
to
prove
that
it
be
the
most
honourable
and
advantageous
peace
that
England
have
ever
make
since
the
foundation
of
the
monarchy
.
  
<EOS>
Nay
,
between
friend
,
he
offer
such
reason
on
this
subject
,
that
I
be
really
confound
,
if
not
convinced
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
not
allow
that
the
Scots
abound
above
their
proportion
in
the
army
and
navy
of
Great
-
Britain
,
or
that
the
English
have
any
reason
to
say
his
countryman
have
meet
with
extraordinary
encouragement
in
the
service
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
a
South
and
North
-
Briton
(
say
he
)
be
competitor
for
a
place
or
commission
,
which
be
in
the
disposal
of
an
english
minister
or
an
english
general
,
it
would
be
absurd
to
suppose
that
the
preference
will
not
be
give
to
the
native
of
England
,
who
have
so
many
advantage
over
his
rival
.
  
<EOS>
first
and
formost
,
he
have
in
his
favour
that
laudable
partiality
,
which
,
Mr
Addison
say
,
never
fail
to
cleave
to
the
heart
of
an
Englishman
;
secondly
,
he
have
more
powerful
connexion
,
and
a
great
share
of
parliamentary
interest
,
by
which
those
contest
be
generally
decide
;
and
lastly
,
he
have
a
great
command
of
money
to
smooth
the
way
to
his
success
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
I
know
no
Scotch
officer
,
who
have
rise
in
the
army
above
the
rank
of
a
subaltern
,
without
purchase
every
degree
of
preferment
either
with
money
or
recruit
;
but
<EOS>
I
know
many
gentleman
of
that
country
,
who
,
for
want
of
money
and
interest
,
have
grow
grey
in
the
rank
of
lieutenant
;
whereas
very
few
instance
of
this
ill
-
fortune
be
to
be
find
among
the
native
of
South
-
Britain
.
  
<EOS>
not
that
I
would
insinuate
that
my
countryman
have
the
least
reason
to
complain
.
  
<EOS>
Preferment
in
the
service
,
like
success
in
any
other
branch
of
traffic
,
will
naturally
favour
those
who
have
the
great
stock
of
cash
and
credit
,
merit
and
capacity
being
suppose
equal
on
all
side
.
"
    
<EOS>
but
the
most
hardy
of
all
this
original
's
position
be
these
:
  
that
commerce
would
,
sooner
or
later
,
prove
the
ruin
of
every
nation
,
where
it
flourish
to
any
extent
  
that
the
parliament
be
the
rotten
part
of
the
british
constitution
 
that
the
liberty
of
the
press
be
a
national
evil
 
and
that
the
boasted
institution
of
jury
,
as
manage
in
England
be
productive
of
shameful
perjury
and
flagrant
injustice
.
<EOS>
He
observe
,
that
traffic
be
an
enemy
to
all
the
liberal
passion
of
the
soul
,
found
on
the
thirst
of
lucre
,
a
sordid
disposition
to
take
advantage
of
the
necessity
of
our
fellow
-
creature
.
  
<EOS>
He
affirm
,
the
nature
of
commerce
be
such
,
that
it
could
not
be
fix
or
perpetuate
,
but
,
have
slow
to
a
certain
height
,
would
immediately
begin
to
ebb
,
and
to
continue
till
the
channel
should
be
leave
almost
dry
;
but
there
be
no
instance
of
the
tide
's
rise
a
second
time
to
any
considerable
influx
in
the
same
nation
.
<EOS>
mean
while
the
sudden
affluence
occasion
by
trade
,
force
open
all
the
sluice
of
luxury
,
and
overflow
the
land
with
every
species
of
profligacy
and
corruption
,
a
total
pravity
of
manner
would
ensue
,
and
this
must
be
attend
with
bankruptcy
and
ruin
.
<EOS>
He
observe
of
the
parliament
,
that
the
practice
of
buy
borough
,
and
canvass
for
vote
,
be
an
avow
system
of
venality
,
already
establish
on
the
ruin
of
principle
,
integrity
,
faith
,
and
good
order
,
in
consequence
of
which
the
elect
and
the
elector
,
and
,
in
short
,
the
whole
body
of
the
people
,
be
equally
and
universally
contaminated
and
corrupt
.
<EOS>
He
affirm
,
that
of
a
parliament
thus
constitute
,
the
crown
would
always
have
influence
enough
to
secure
a
great
majority
in
its
dependence
,
from
the
great
number
of
post
,
place
,
and
pension
it
have
to
bestow
;
that
such
a
parliament
would
(
as
it
have
already
do
)
<EOS>
lengthen
the
term
of
its
sitting
and
authority
,
whenever
the
prince
should
think
it
for
his
interest
to
continue
the
representative
;
for
without
doubt
,
they
have
the
same
right
to
protract
their
authority
ad
infinitum
,
as
they
have
to
extend
it
from
three
to
seven
year
  
with
a
parliament
,
therefore
,
dependent
upon
the
crown
,
devote
to
the
prince
,
and
support
by
a
stand
army
,
garble
and
model
for
the
purpose
,
<EOS>
any
king
of
England
may
,
and
probably
some
ambitious
sovereign
will
,
totally
overthrow
all
the
bulwark
of
the
constitution
;
for
it
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
a
prince
of
a
high
spirit
will
tamely
submit
to
be
thwart
in
all
his
measure
,
abuse
and
insult
by
a
populace
of
unbridled
ferocity
,
when
he
have
it
in
his
power
to
crush
all
opposition
under
his
foot
with
the
concurrence
of
the
legislature
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
he
should
always
consider
the
liberty
of
the
press
as
a
national
evil
,
while
it
enable
the
vile
reptile
to
soil
the
lustre
of
the
most
shining
merit
,
and
furnish
the
most
infamous
incendiary
with
the
mean
of
disturb
the
peace
,
and
destroy
the
good
order
of
the
community
.
<EOS>
He
own
,
however
,
that
,
under
due
restriction
,
it
would
be
a
valuable
privilege
;
but
affirm
,
that
at
present
there
be
a
no
law
in
England
sufficient
to
restrain
it
within
proper
bound
,
    
with
respect
to
jury
,
he
express
himself
to
this
effect
:
  
<EOS>
jury
be
generally
compose
of
illiterate
plebeian
,
apt
to
be
mistaken
,
easily
mislead
,
and
open
to
sinister
influence
;
for
if
either
of
the
party
to
be
try
,
can
gain
over
one
of
the
twelve
juror
,
he
have
secure
the
verdict
in
his
favour
;
the
jurymen
thus
bring
over
,
will
,
in
despight
of
all
evidence
and
conviction
,
generally
hold
out
till
his
fellow
be
fatigue
,
and
harass
,
and
starve
into
concurrence
;
in
which
case
the
verdict
be
unjust
,
and
the
juror
be
all
perjure
:
but
case
will
often
occur
,
when
the
juror
be
really
divide
in
opinion
,
and
each
side
be
convince
in
opposition
to
the
other
;
but
no
verdict
will
be
receive
,
unless
they
be
unanimous
,
and
they
be
all
bind
,
not
only
in
conscience
,
but
by
oath
,
to
judge
and
declare
accord
to
their
conviction
.
  
<EOS>
what
then
will
be
the
consequence
?
  
<EOS>
They
must
either
starve
in
company
,
or
one
side
must
sacrifice
their
conscience
to
their
convenience
,
and
join
in
a
verdict
which
they
believe
to
be
false
.
<EOS>
this
absurdity
be
avoid
in
Sweden
,
where
a
bare
majority
be
sufficient
;
and
in
Scotland
,
where
two
third
of
the
jury
be
require
to
concur
in
the
verdict
.
    
<EOS>
You
must
not
imagine
that
all
these
deduction
be
make
on
his
part
,
without
contradiction
on
mine
 
<EOS>
no
 
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
I
find
myself
pique
in
point
of
honour
,
at
his
pretending
to
be
so
much
wise
than
his
neighbour
.
  
<EOS>
I
question
all
his
assertion
,
start
innumerable
objection
,
argue
and
wrangle
with
uncommon
perseverance
,
and
grow
very
warm
,
and
even
violent
in
the
debate
.
  
<EOS>
sometimes
he
be
puzzle
,
and
once
or
twice
,
I
think
,
fairly
refute
;
but
from
those
fall
he
rise
again
,
like
Antaeus
,
with
redouble
vigour
,
till
at
length
<EOS>
I
be
tired
,
exhaust
,
and
really
do
not
know
how
to
proceed
,
when
luckily
he
drop
a
hint
,
by
which
he
discover
he
have
be
breed
to
the
law
;
a
confession
which
enable
me
to
retire
from
the
dispute
with
a
good
grace
,
as
it
could
not
be
suppose
that
a
man
like
me
,
who
have
be
breed
to
nothing
,
should
be
able
to
cope
with
a
veteran
in
his
own
profession
.
<EOS>
I
believe
,
however
,
that
I
shall
for
some
time
continue
to
chew
the
cud
of
reflection
upon
many
observation
which
this
original
discharge
.
    
<EOS>
whether
our
sister
Tabby
be
really
strike
with
his
conversation
,
or
be
resolve
to
throw
at
every
thing
she
meet
in
the
shape
of
a
man
,
till
she
can
fasten
the
matrimonial
noose
,
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
she
have
take
desperate
stride
towards
the
affection
of
Lismahago
,
who
can
not
be
say
to
have
meet
her
half
way
,
tho
'
he
do
not
seem
altogether
insensible
to
her
civility
  
<EOS>
She
insinuate
more
than
once
<EOS>
how
happy
we
should
be
to
have
his
company
through
that
part
of
Scotland
which
we
propose
to
visit
,
<EOS>
till
at
length
he
plainly
tell
us
,
that
his
road
be
totally
different
from
that
which
we
intend
to
take
;
that
,
for
his
part
,
his
company
would
be
of
very
little
service
to
us
in
our
progress
,
as
he
be
utterly
unacquainted
with
the
country
,
which
he
have
leave
in
his
early
youth
,
consequently
,
he
could
neither
direct
us
in
our
inquiry
,
nor
introduce
us
to
any
family
of
distinction
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
he
be
stimulate
by
an
irresistible
impulse
to
revisit
the
paternus
lar
,
or
patria
domus
,
though
he
expect
little
satisfaction
,
inasmuch
as
he
understand
that
his
nephew
,
the
present
possessor
,
be
but
ill
qualified
to
support
the
honour
of
the
family
.
  
<EOS>
He
assure
us
,
however
,
as
we
design
to
return
by
the
west
road
,
that
he
will
watch
our
motion
,
and
endeavour
to
pay
his
respect
to
us
at
Dumsries
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
he
take
his
leave
of
us
at
a
place
half
way
<EOS>
betwixt
Morpeth
and
Alnwick
,
and
prance
away
in
great
state
,
mount
on
a
tall
,
meagre
,
raw
-
bone
,
shamble
grey
gelding
,
without
e'er
a
tooth
in
his
head
,
the
very
counter
-
part
of
the
rider
;
and
,
indeed
,
the
appearance
of
the
two
be
so
picturesque
,
that
I
would
give
twenty
guinea
to
have
them
tolerably
represent
on
canva

Northumberland

but
you
will
be
surprised
when
I
tell
you
that
the
english
side
of
that
river
be
neither
so
well
cultivated
nor
so
populous
as
the
other

<EOS>
the

the
land
uninclose

and
scarce
a
gentleman

seat
be
to

see
in
some
mile
from
the
Tweed
;
whereas
the
Scots
be
advance
in
crowd
to
the
very
brink
of
the

that
you

reckon
above

still
adhere
to
methodism

have
the
benefit
of
a
sermon
at
Wesley

I
believe
the

in

measure
abate
the

devotion
both
in

Mrs

dear
WAT
,
in
my
two
last
<EOS>
you
have
so
much
of
Lismahago
,
that
I
suppose
you
be
glad
he
be
go
off
the

for
the

.
  
<EOS>
I
must
now
descend
to

.
  
<EOS>
love
,
it
seem
,
be
resolve
to
assert
his
dominion
over
all
the
female
of
our
family
.
  
<EOS>
after
have
practise
upon
poor
Liddy
's
heart
,
and
play
strange
vagary
with
our
aunt
Mrs
Tabitha
,
he
begin
to
run
riot
in
the
affection
of
her
woman
Mrs
Winifred
Jenkins
,
whom
I
have
have
occasion
to
mention
more
than
once
in
the
course
of
our
memoir
.
<EOS>
nature
intend
Jenkins
for
something
very
different
from
the
character
of
her
mistress
;
yet
custom
and
habit
have
effect
a
wonderful
resemblance
betwixt
them
in
many
particular
.
<EOS>
Win
,
to
be
sure
,
be
much
young
and
more
agreeable
in
her
person
;
she
be
likewise
tender
-
hearted
and
benevolent
,
quality
for
which
her
mistress
be
by
no
mean
remarkable
,
no
more
than
she
be
for
be
of
a
timorous
disposition
,
and
much
subject
to
fit
of
the
mother
,
which
be
the
infirmity
of
Win
's
constitution
:
but
then
she
seem
to
have
adopt
Mrs
Tabby
's
manner
with
her
cast
cloath
.
  
<EOS>
She
dress
and
endeavour
to
look
like
her
mistress
,
although
her
own
look
be
much
more
engaging
.
  
<EOS>
She
enter
into
her
scheme
of
oeconomy
,
learn
her
phrase
,
repeat
her
remark
,
imitate
her
stile
in
scold
the
inferior
servant
,
and
,
finally
,
subscribe
implicitly
to
her
system
of
devotion
  
<EOS>
this
,
indeed
,
she
find
the
more
agreeable
,
as
it
be
in
a
great
measure
introduce
and
confirm
by
the
ministry
of
Clinker
,
with
whose
personal
merit
she
seem
to
have
be
strike
ever
since
he
exhibit
the
pattern
of
his
naked
skin
at
Marlborough
.
    
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
though
Humphry
have
this
double
hank
upon
her
inclination
,
and
exert
all
his
power
to
maintain
the
conquest
he
have
make
,
he
find
it
impossible
to
guard
it
on
the
side
of
vanity
,
where
poor
Win
be
as
frail
as
any
female
in
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
my
rascal
Dutton
profess
himself
her
admirer
,
and
,
by
dint
of
his
outlandish
qualification
,
throw
his
rival
Clinker
out
of
the
saddle
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Humphry
may
be
compare
to
an
english
pudding
,
compose
of
good
wholesome
flour
and
suet
,
and
Dutton
to
a
syllabub
or
ice
froth
,
which
,
though
agreeable
to
the
taste
,
have
nothing
solid
or
substantial
.
<EOS>
the
traitor
not
only
dazzle
her
with
his
second

hand
finery
,
but
he
fawn
,
and
flatter
,
and
cringe
 
he
teach
her
to
take
rappee
,
and
present
her
with
a
snuff
-
box
of
papier
mache
 
<EOS>
he
supply
her
with
a
powder
for
her
tooth
 
<EOS>
he
mend
her
complexion

and
he
dress
her
hair
in
the
Paris
fashion
 
<EOS>
he
undertake
to
be
her
french
master
and
her
dancing

master
,
as
well
as
friseur
,
and
thus
imperceptibly
wound
himself
into
her
good
grace
.
<EOS>
clinker
perceive
the
progress
he
have
make
,
and
repine
in
secret
.
  
<EOS>
He
attempt
to
open
her
eye
in
the
way
of
exhortation
,
and
,
find
it
produce
no
effect
,
have
recourse
to
prayer
.
<EOS>
at
Newcastle
,
while
he
attend
Mrs
Tabby
to
the
methodist
meeting
,
his
rival
accompany
Mrs
Jenkins
to
the
play
.
<EOS>
He
be
dress
in
a
silk
coat
,
make
at
Paris
for
his
former
master
,
with
a
tawdry
waistcoat
of
tarnished
brocard
;
he
wear
his
hair
in
a
great
bag
with
a
huge
solitaire
,
and
a
long
sword
dangle
from
his
thigh
.
<EOS>
the
lady
be
all
of
a
flutter
with
fade
lutestring
,
wash
gauze
,
and
riband
three
time
refresh
;
but
she
be
most
remarkable
for
the
frisure
of
her
head
,
which
rise
,
like
a
pyramid
,
seven
inch
above
the
scalp
,
and
her
face
be
prime
and
patch
from
the
chin
up
to
the
eye
;
nay
,
the
gallant
himself
have
spare
neither
red
nor
white
in
improve
the
nature
of
his
own
complexion
.
<EOS>
in
this
attire
,
they
walk
together
through
the
high
street
to
the
theatre
,
and
as
they
pass
for
player
ready
dress
for
acting
,
they
reach
it
unmoleste
;
but
as
it
be
still
light
when
they
return
,
and
by
that
time
the
people
have
get
information
of
their
real
character
and
condition
,
they
hiss
and
hoot
all
the
way
,
and
Mrs
Jenkins
be
all
bespatter
with
dirt
,
as
well
as
insult
with
the
opprobious
name
of
paint
Jezabel
,
so
that
her
fright
and
mortification
throw
her
into
an
hysteric
fit
the
moment
she
come
home
.
    
<EOS>
Clinker
be
so
incensed
at
Dutton
,
whom
he
consider
as
the
cause
of
her
disgrace
,
that
he
upbraid
him
severely
for
have
turn
the
poor
young
woman
's
brain
.
<EOS>
the
other
affect
to
treat
him
with
contempt
,
and
mistake
his
forbearance
for
want
of
courage
,
threaten
to
horse
-
whip
him
into
good
manner
.
<EOS>
Humphry
then
come
to
me
,
humbly
beg
I
would
give
him
leave
to
chastise
my
servant
for
his
insolence
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
challenge
me
to
fight
him
at
sword
's
point
(
say
he
)
;
but
I
may
as
well
challenge
him
to
make
a
horse
-
shoe
,
or
a
plough
-
iron
;
for
I
know
no
more
of
the
one
than
he
do
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
besides
,
it
doth
not
become
servant
to
use
those
weapon
,
or
to
claim
the
privilege
of
gentleman
to
kill
one
another
when
they
fall
out
;
moreover
,
I
would
not
have
his
blood
upon
my
conscience
for
ten
thousand
time
the
profit
or
satisfaction
I
should
get
by
his
death
;
but
if
your
honour
will
not
be
angry
,
I
will
engage
to
gee
'
en
a
good
drubbing
,
that
,
may
hap
,
will
do
'
en
service
,
and
I
will
take
care
<EOS>
it
shall
do
'
en
no
harm
.
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
I
have
no
objection
to
what
he
propose
,
provide
he
could
manage
matter
so
as
not
to
be
find
the
aggressor
,
in
case
Dutton
should
prosecute
him
for
an
assault
and
battery
.
    
<EOS>
thus
license
,
he
retire
;
and
that
same
evening
easily
provoke
his
rival
to
strike
the
first
blow
,
which
Clinker
return
with
such
interest
,
that
he
be
oblige
to
call
for
quarter
,
declare
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
he
would
exact
severe
and
bloody
satisfaction
the
moment
we
should
pass
the
border
,
when
he
could
run
him
through
the
body
without
fear
of
the
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
this
scene
pass
in
presence
of
lieutenant
Lismahago
,
who
encourage
Clinker
to
hazard
a
thrust
of
cold
iron
with
his
antagonist
.
"
<EOS>
cold
iron
(
cry
Humphry
)
<EOS>
I
shall
never
use
against
the
life
of
any
human
creature
;
but
I
be
so
far
from
be
afraid
of
his
cold
iron
,
that
I
shall
use
nothing
in
my
defence
but
a
good
cudgel
,
which
shall
always
be
at
his
service
.
<EOS>
"
in
the
mean
time
,
the
fair
cause
of
this
contest
;
Mrs
Winifred
Jenkins
,
seem
overwhelmed
with
affliction
,
and
Mr
Clinker
act
much
on
the
reserve
,
though
he
do
not
presume
to
find
fault
with
her
conduct
.
    
<EOS>
the
dispute
between
the
two
rival
be
soon
bring
to
a
very
unexpected
issue
.
<EOS>
among
our
fellow
-
lodger
at
Berwick
,
be
a
couple
from
London
,
bind
to
Edinburgh
,
on
the
voyage
of
matrimony
.
<EOS>
the
female
be
the
daughter
and
heiress
of
a
pawn
-
broker
deceased
,
who
have
give
her
guardian
the
slip
,
and
put
herself
under
the
tuition
of
a
tall
Hibernian
,
who
have
conduct
her
thus
far
in
quest
of
a
clergyman
to
unite
them
in
marriage
,
without
the
formality
require
by
the
law
of
England
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
the
lover
have
behave
on
the
road
,
so
as
to
decline
in
favour
of
his
inamorata
;
but
,
in
all
probability
,
Dutton
perceive
a
coldness
on
her
side
,
which
encourage
him
to
whisper
,
it
be
a
pity
she
should
have
cast
her
affection
upon
a
taylor
,
which
he
affirm
the
Irishman
to
be
.
<EOS>
this
discovery
compleate
her
disgust
,
of
which
my
man
take
the
advantage
,
begin
to
recommend
himself
to
her
good
grace
,
and
the
smooth
-
tongued
rascal
find
no
difficulty
to
insinuate
himself
into
the
place
of
her
heart
from
which
the
other
have
be
discard
.
  
<EOS>
Their
resolution
be
immediately
take
.
<EOS>
in
the
morning
,
before
day
,
while
poor
Teague
lie
snore
a
-
bed
,
his
indefatigable
rival
order
a
post
-
chaise
,
and
set
out
with
the
lady
for
Coldstream
,
a
few
mile
up
the
Tweed
,
where
there
be
a
person
who
deal
in
this
branch
of
commerce
,
and
they
be
noose
,
before
the
Irishman
ever
dreamt
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
get
up
at
six
o'clock
,
and
find
the
bird
be
fly
,
he
make
such
a
noise
as
alarm
the
whole
house
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
first
person
he
encounter
,
be
the
postilion
return
from
Coldstream
,
where
he
have
be
witness
to
the
marriage
,
and
over
and
above
an
handsome
gratuity
,
have
receive
a
bride
's
favour
,
which
he
now
wear
in
his
cap
  
<EOS>
when
the
forsaken
lover
understand
they
be
actually
married
.
<EOS>
and
set
out
for
London
;
and
that
Dutton
have
discover
to
the
lady
,
that
he
(
the
Hibernian
)
be
a
taylor
,
he
have
like
to
have
run
distract
.
<EOS>
He
tear
the
riband
from
the
fellow
's
cap
,
and
beat
about
his
ear
.
<EOS>
He
swear
he
would
pursue
him
to
the
gate
of
hell
,
and
order
a
post
-
chaise
and
four
to
be
get
ready
as
soon
as
possible
;
but
,
recollect
that
his
finance
would
not
admit
of
this
way
of
travelling
,
he
be
oblige
to
countermand
this
order
.
    
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
know
nothing
at
all
of
what
have
happen
,
till
the
postilion
bring
me
the
key
of
my
trunk
and
portmanteau
,
which
he
have
receive
from
Dutton
,
who
send
me
his
respect
,
hope
I
would
excuse
him
for
his
abrupt
departure
,
as
it
be
a
step
upon
which
his
fortune
depend
  
before
I
have
time
to
make
my
uncle
acquaint
with
this
event
,
the
Irishman
burst
into
my
chamber
,
without
any
introduction
,
exclaim
,
  
"
<EOS>
but
my
soul
,
your
sarvant
have
rob
me
of
five
thousand
pound
,
and
I
will
have
satisfaction
,
if
I
should
be
hang
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
"
when
I
ask
him
who
he
be
,
"
My
name
(
say
he
)
be
Master
Macloughlin
 
<EOS>
but
it
should
be
Leighlin
Oneale
,
<EOS>
for
I
be
come
from
Ter
-
Owen
the
great
;
and
so
I
be
as
good
a
gentleman
as
any
in
Ireland
;
and
that
rouge
,
your
sarvant
,
say
I
be
a
taylor
,
which
be
as
big
a
lie
as
if
he
have
call
me
the
pope
  
<EOS>
I
be
a
man
of
fortune
,
and
have
spend
all
I
have
;
and
so
be
in
distress
,
Mr
Coshgrave
,
the
fashioner
in
Shuffolk
-
street
,
tuck
me
out
,
and
make
me
his
own
private
secretary
:
by
the
same
token
,
I
be
the
last
he
bail
;
for
his
freind
oblige
him
to
tie
himself
up
,
that
he
would
bail
no
more
above
ten
pound
;
for
why
,
because
as
how
,
he
could
not
refuse
any
body
that
ask
,
and
therefore
in
time
would
have
rob
himself
of
his
whole
fortune
,
and
,
if
he
have
live
long
at
that
rate
,
must
have
die
bankrupt
very
soon
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
make
my
address
to
Miss
Skinner
,
a
young
lady
of
five
thousand
pound
fortune
,
who
agree
to
take
me
for
well
nor
bad
;
and
,
to
be
sure
,
this
day
would
have
put
me
in
possession
,
if
it
have
not
be
for
that
rogue
,
your
sarvant
,
who
come
like
a
tief
,
and
steal
away
my
property
,
and
make
her
believe
I
be
a
taylor
;
and
that
she
be
go
to
marry
the
ninth
part
of
a
man
:
<EOS>
but
the
devil
burn
my
soul
,
if
ever
I
catch
him
on
the
mountain
of
Tulloghobegly
,
if
I
do
not
shew
him
that
I
be
nine
time
as
good
<EOS>
a
man
as
he
,
or
e'er
a
bug
of
his
country
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
when
he
have
ring
out
his
first
alarm
,
I
tell
him
I
be
sorry
he
have
allow
himself
to
be
so
jockied
;
but
it
be
no
business
of
mine
;
and
that
the
fellow
who
rob
him
of
his
bride
,
have
likewise
rob
me
of
my
servant
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
I
tell
you
then
,
(
cry
he
,
)
<EOS>
that
rogue
be
his
true
christian
name
.
  
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
if
I
have
but
one
fair
trust
with
him
upon
the
sod
,
I
would
give
him
lave
to
brag
all
the
rest
of
his
life
.
"
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
hear
the
noise
,
come
in
,
and
be
inform
of
this
adventure
,
begin
to
comfort
Mr
Oneale
for
the
lady
's
elopement
;
observe
that
he
seem
to
have
have
a
lucky
escape
,
that
it
be
well
she
should
elope
before
,
than
after
marriage
  
<EOS>
the
Hibernian
be
of
a
very
different
opinion
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
if
he
have
be
once
married
,
she
may
have
elope
as
soon
as
she
please
;
he
would
have
take
care
that
she
should
not
have
carry
her
fortune
along
with
her
  
<EOS>
ah
<EOS>
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
she
be
a
Judas
Iscariot
,
and
have
betray
me
with
a
kiss
;
and
,
like
Judas
,
she
carry
the
bag
,
and
have
not
leave
me
money
enough
to
bear
my
expence
back
to
London
;
and
so
as
I
be
come
to
this
pass
,
and
the
rogue
that
be
the
occasion
of
it
have
leave
you
without
a
sarvant
,
you
may
put
me
in
his
place
;
and
by
Jasus
,
it
be
the
good
thing
you
can
do
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
beg
to
be
excuse
,
declare
I
could
put
up
with
any
inconvenience
,
rather
than
treat
as
a
footman
the
descendant
of
Tir
owen
the
Great
.
<EOS>
I
advise
him
to
return
to
his
friend
,
Mr
Cosgrave
,
and
take
his
passage
from
Newcastle
by
sea
,
towards
which
I
make
him
a
small
present
,
and
he
retire
,
seemingly
resign
to
his
evil
fortune
.
<EOS>
I
have
take
upon
trial
a
Scotchman
,
call
Archy
M'Alpin
,
an
old
soldier
,
whose
last
master
,
a
colonel
,
lately
die
at
Berwick
.
<EOS>
the
fellow
be
old
and
withered
;
but
he
have
be
recommend
to
me
for
his
fidelity
,
by
Mrs
Humphreys
,
a
very
good
sort
of
a
woman
who
keep
the
inn
at
Tweedmouth
,
and
be
much
respect
by
all
the
traveller
on
this
road
.
    
<EOS>
Clinker
,
without
doubt
,
think
himself
happy
in
the
removal
of
a
dangerous
rival
,
and
he
be
too
good
a
christian
,
to
repine
at
Dutton
's
success
.
<EOS>
even
Mrs
Jenkins
will
have
reason
to
congratulate
herself
upon
this
event
,
when
she
coolly
reflect
upon
the
matter
;
for
,
howsoever
she
be
force
from
her
poise
for
a
season
,
by
snare
lay
for
her
vanity
,
Humphry
be
certainly
the
north
-
star
to
which
the
needle
of
her
affection
would
have
point
at
the
long
run
.
<EOS>
at
present
,
the
same
vanity
be
exceedingly
mortify
,
upon
find
herself
abandon
by
her
new
admirer
,
in
favour
of
another
inamorata
.
<EOS>
She
receive
the
news
with
a
violent
burst
of
laughter
which
soon
bring
on
a
fit
of
crying
;
and
this
give
the
finish
blow
to
the
patience
of
her
mistress
,
which
have
hold
out
beyond
all
expectation
.
<EOS>
She
now
open
all
those
flood
-
gate
of
reprehension
,
which
have
be
shut
so
long
.
<EOS>
She
not
only
reproach
her
with
her
levity
and
indiscretion
,
but
attack
her
on
the
score
of
religion
,
declare
roundly
that
she
be
in
a
state
of
apostacy
and
reprobation
;
and
finally
,
threaten
to
send
her
a
-
packing
at
this
extremity
of
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
all
the
family
intercede
for
poor
Winifrid
,
not
even
except
her
slighted
swain
,
Mr
Clinker
,
who
,
on
his
knee
,
implore
and
obtain
her
pardon
.
    
<EOS>
there
be
,
however
,
another
consideration
that
give
Mrs
Tabitha
some
disturbance
.
<EOS>
at
Newcastle
,
the
servant
have
be
inform
by
some
wag
,
that
there
be
nothing
to
eat
in
Scotland
,
but
oat
meal
and
sheep
's
head
;
and
Lieutenant
Lismahago
be
consult
,
what
he
say
serve
rather
to
confirm
than
to
refute
the
report
.
<EOS>
Our
aunt
be
apprise
of
this
circumstance
,
very
gravely
advise
her
brother
to
provide
a
sumpter
horse
with
store
of
ham
,
tongue
,
bread
,
biscuit
,
and
other
article
for
our
subsistence
,
in
the
course
of
our
peregrination
,
and
Mr
Bramble
,
as
gravely
reply
,
that
he
would
take
the
hint
into
consideration
:
but
,
find
no
such
provision
be
make
,
she
now
revive
the
proposal
,
observe
that
there
be
a
tolerable
market
at
Berwick
,
where
we
may
be
supply
;
and
that
my
man
's
horse
would
serve
as
a
beast
of
burden
  
<EOS>
the
"
squire
shrug
up
his
shoulder
,
eye
her
askance
with
a
look
of
ineffable
contempt
;
and
after
some
pause
,
"
Sister
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
persuade
myself
you
be
serious
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
so
little
acquaint
with
the
geography
of
the
island
,
that
she
imagine
we
could
not
go
to
Scotland
but
by
sea
;
and
,
after
we
have
pass
through
the
town
of
Berwick
,
when
he
tell
her
we
be
upon
scottish
ground
,
she
could
hardly
believe
the
assertion
  
<EOS>
if
the
truth
must
be
tell
,
the
South
Britons
in
general
be
woefully
ignorant
in
this
particular
.
<EOS>
what
,
between
want
of
curiosity
,
and
traditional
sarcasm
,
the
effect
of
ancient
animosity
,
the
people
at
the
other
end
of
the
island
know
as
little
of
Scotland
as
of
Japan
.
    
<EOS>
if
I
have
never
be
in
Wales
,
I
should
have
be
more
strike
with
the
manif
difference
in
appearance
betwix
the
peasant
and
commonalty
on
different
side
of
the
Tweed
.
<EOS>
the
boor
of
Northumberland
be
lusty
fellow
,
fresh
complexion
,
cleanly
,
and
well
cloathed
;
but
the
labourer
in
Scotland
be
generally
lank
,
lean
,
hard
-
feature
,
sallow
,
soil
,
and
shabby
,
and
their
little
pinch
blue
cap
have
a
beggarly
effect
.
<EOS>
the
cattle
be
much
in
the
same
stile
with
their
driver
,
meagre
,
stunted
,
and
ill
equipt
.
<EOS>
when
I
talk
to
my
uncle
on
this
subject
,
he
say
,
"
though
all
the
scottish
hind
would
not
bear
to
be
compare
with
those
of
the
rich
county
of
South
Britain
,
they
would
stand
very
well
in
competition
with
the
peasant
of
France
,
Italy
,
and
Savoy
 
not
to
mention
the
mountaineer
of
Wales
,
and
the
red

shank
of
Ireland
.
"
    
<EOS>
We
enter
Scotland
by
a
frightful
moor
of
sixteen
mile
,
which
promise
very
little
for
the
interior
part
of
the
kingdom
;
but
the
prospect
mend
as
we
advance
.
<EOS>
pass
through
Dunbar
,
which
be
a
neat
little
town
,
situate
on
the
sea
-
side
,
we
lie
at
a
country
inn
,
where
our
entertainment
far
exceed
our
expectation
;
but
for
this
we
can
not
give
the
Scot
credit
,
as
the
landlord
be
a
native
of
England
.
<EOS>
yesterday
we
dine
at
Haddington
,
which
have
be
a
place
of
some
consideration
,
but
be
now
go
to
decay
;
and
in
the
evening
arrive
at
this
metropolis
,
of
which
I
can
say
very
little
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
romantic
,
from
its
situation
on
the
declivity
of
a
hill
,
have
a
fortified
castle
at
the
top
,
and
a
royal
palace
at
the
bottom
.
<EOS>
the
first
thing
that
strike
the
nose
of
a
stranger
,
shall
be
nameless
;
but
what
first
strike
the
eye
,
be
the
unconscionable
height
of
the
house
,
which
generally
rise
to
five
,
six
,
seven
,
and
eight
story
,
and
,
in
some
place
,
(
as
I
be
assure
)
to
twelve
.
<EOS>
this
manner
of
building
,
attend
with
numberless
inconvenience
,
must
have
be
originally
owe
to
want
of
room
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
the
town
seem
to
be
full
of
people
:
but
their
look
,
their
language
,
and
their
custom
,
be
so
different
from
our
,
that
I
can
hardly
believe
myself
in
Great
-
Britain
.
    
<EOS>
the
inn
at
which
we
put
up
,
(
if
it
may
be
so
call
)
be
so
filthy
and
disagreeable
in
all
respect
.
<EOS>
that
my
uncle
begin
to
fret
,
and
his
gouty
symptom
,
to
recur
  
recollecting
,
however
,
that
he
have
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
one
Mr
Mitchelson
,
a
lawyer
,
he
send
it
by
his
servant
,
with
a
compliment
,
import
that
he
would
wait
upon
him
next
day
in
person
;
but
that
gentleman
visit
us
immediately
,
and
insist
upon
our
go
to
his
own
house
,
until
he
could
provide
lodging
for
our
accommodation
.
<EOS>
We
gladly
accept
of
his
invitation

and
repair
to
his
house

where
we
be
treat
with
equal
elegance
and
hospitality

to
the
utter
confusion
of
our

though
begin

<EOS>
to

<EOS>
DEAR
LEWIS
,
that
part
of
Scotland
contiguous
to
Berwick
nature
seem
to
have
intend
as
a
barrier
between
two
hostile
nation
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
brown
desert
of
considerable
extent
,
that
produce
nothing
but
heath
and
fern
;
and
what
render
it
the
more
dreary
when
we
pass
,
there
be
a
thick
fog
that
hinder
us
from
see
above
twenty
yard
from
the
carriage
  
<EOS>
My
sister
begin
to
make
wry
face
,
and
use
her
smelling
-
bottle
;
Liddy
look
blank
,
and
Mrs
Jenkins
deject
;
but
in
a
few
hour
these
cloud
be
dissipate
;
the
sea
appear
upon
our
right
and
on
the
left
the
mountain
retire
a
little
,
leave
an
agreeable
plain
betwixt
them
and
the
beach
;
but
,
what
surprise
us
all
,
this
plain
,
to
the
extent
of
several
mile
,
be
cover
with
as
fine
wheat
as
ever
<EOS>
I
see
in
the
most
fertile
part
of
South
Britain
  
<EOS>
this
plentiful
crop
be
raise
in
the
open
field
,
without
any
inclosure
,
or
other
manure
than
the
alga
marina
,
or
sea
-
weed
,
which
abound
on
this
coast
;
a
circumstance
which
shew
that
the
soil
and
climate
be
favourable
;
but
that
agriculture
in
this
country
be
not
yet
bring
to
tha
perfection
which
it
have
attain
in
England
.
<EOS>
Inclosures
would
not
only
keep
the
ground
warm
,
and
the
several
field
distinct
,
but
would
also
protect
the
crop
from
the
high
wind
,
which
be
so
frequent
in
this
part
of
the
island
.
    
<EOS>
Dunbar
be
well
situate
for
trade
,
and
have
a
curious
bason
,
where
ship
of
small
burden
may
be
perfectly
secure
;
but
there
be
little
appearance
of
business
in
the
place
  
<EOS>
from
thence
,
all
the
way
to
Edinburgh
,
there
be
a
continual
succession
of
fine
seat
,
belong
to
nobleman
and
gentleman
;
and
as
each
be
surround
by
its
own
park
and
plantation
,
they
produce
a
very
pleasing
effect
in
a
country
which
lie
otherwise
open
and
expose
.
<EOS>
at
Dunbar
there
be
a
noble
park
,
with
a
lodge
,
belong
to
the
Duke
of
Roxburg
,
where
Oliver
Cromwell
have
his

Lesley

such
a
manner

that
he

forfeit
the
advantage

obtain

Their

<EOS>
in

Haddington

there
be
a
gentleman

house

in
the
building

which

and
the
improvement
about
,
it

he
be
say
to
have
expend
forty
thousand
pound

<EOS>
but
I
can
not
say
I
be
much
pleased
with
either
the
architecture

the
situation
;
though
it
have
in
front
a
pastoral
stream
,
the
bank
of
which
be
lay
out
in
a
very
agreeable
manner

<EOS>
I
intend
to
pay
my
respect
to
lord
Elibank
,
whom
I
have
the
honour
to
know
at
London
many
year
ago
.
<EOS>
He
live
in
this
part
of
Lothian
;
but
be
go
to
the
North
,
on
a
visit
  
<EOS>
You
have
often
hear
me
mention
this
nobleman
,
whom
I
have
long
revere
for
his
humanity
and
universal
intelligence
,
over
and
above
the
entertainment
arise
from
the
originality
of
his
character
  
at
Musselburgh
,
however
,
I
have
the
good
fortune
to
drink
tea
with
my
old
friend
Mr
Cardonel
;
and
at
his
house
I
meet
with
Dr
C

,
the
parson
of
the
parish
,
whose
humour
and
conversation
inflame
me
with
a
desire
of
be
better
acquaint
with
his
person
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
at
all
surprise
that
these
scot
make
their
way
in
every
quarter
of
the
globe
.
    
<EOS>
this
place
be
but
four
mile
from
Edinburgh
,
towards
which
we
proceed
along
the
sea
-
shore
,
upon
a
firm
bottom
of
smooth
sand
,
which
the
tide
have
leave
uncover
in
its
retreat
  
Edinburgh
,
from
this
avenue
,
be
not
see
to
much
advantage
  
<EOS>
We
have
only
an
imperfect
view
of
the
castle
and
upper
part
of
the
town
,
which
vary
incessantly
accord
to
the
inflexion
of
the
road
,
and
exhibit
the
appearance
of
detatched
spire
and
turret
,
belong
to
some
magnificent
edifice
in
ruin

<EOS>
the
palace

Holyrood

<EOS>
this
be
a
street
continue
from
hence
to
the
gate
call
Nether
Bow
,
which
be
now
take
away
;
so
that
there
be
no
interruption
for
a
long
mile
,
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
of
the
hill
on
which
the
Castle
stand
in
a
most
imperial
situation
  
consider
its
fine
pavement
,
its
width
,
and
the
lofty
house
on
each
side
<EOS>
,
this
would
be
undoubtedly
one
of
the
noble
street
in
Europe
,
if
an
ugly
mass
of
mean
building
,
call
the
Lucken

Booths
,
have
not
thrust
itself
,
by
what
accident
<EOS>
I
know
not

into
the
middle

like
Middle

row

Holborn

<EOS>
the
city
stand
upon
two
hill

the
bottom

them
;
and
,
with
all
its
defect
,
may
very
well
pass
for
the
capital
of
a
moderate
kingdom
  
<EOS>
It
be
full
of
people
,
and
continually
resound
with
the
noise
of
coach
and
other
carriage
,
for
luxury
as
well
as
commerce
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
I
can
perceive
,
her
be
no
want
of
provision
  
<EOS>
the
beef
and
mutton
be
as
delicate
here
as
in
Wales
;
the
sea
afford
plenty
of
good
fish
;
the
bread
be
remarkably
fine
;
and
the
water
be
excellent
,
though
I
be
afraid
not
in
sufficient
quantity
to
answer
all
the
purpose
of
cleanliness
and
convenience
;
article
in
which
,
it
must
be
allow
,
our
fellow

subject
be
a
little
defective
  
<EOS>
the
water
be
bring
in
leadden
pipe
from
a
mountain
in
the
neighbourhood
,
to
a
cistern
on
the
Castle

hill

from
whence
it
be
distribute
to
public
conduit
in
different
part
of
the

from
these
it

up

and
eight

for
the
use
of
particular
family
  
<EOS>
every
story
be
a
complete
house
,
occupy
by
a
separate
family
;
and
the
stair
be
common
to
them
all
,
be
generally
leave
in
a
very
filthy
condition
;
a
man
must
tread
with
great
circumspection
to
get
safe
house
with
unpolluted
shoe
  
<EOS>
nothing
can
form
a
strong
contrast
,
than
the
difference
betwixt
the
outside
and
inside
of
the
door
;
for
the
good
woman
of
this
metropolis
be
remarkably
nice
in
the
ornament
and
propriety
of
their
apartment
,
as
if
they
be
resolve
to
transfer
the
imputation
from
the
individual
to
the
public
.
<EOS>
You
be
no
stranger
to
their
method
of
discharge
all
their
impurity
from
their
window
,
at
a
certain
hour
of
the
night
,
as
the
custom
be
in
Spain
,
Portugal
,
and
some
part
of
France
and
Italy
  
a
practice
to
which
I
can
by
no
means
be
reconcile
;
for
notwithstanding
all
the
care
that
be
take
by
their
scavenger
to
remove
this
nuisance
every
morning
by
break
of
day
,
enough
still
remain
to
offend
the
eye
,
as
well
as
other
organ
of
those
whom
use
have
not
harden
against
all
delicacy
of
sensation
.
    
<EOS>
the
inhabitans
seem
insensible
to
these
impression
,
and
be
apt
to
imagine
the
disgust
that
we
avow
be
little
well
than
affectation
;
but
they
ought
to
have
some
compassion
for
stranger
,
who
have
not
be
use
to
this
kind
of
sufferance
;
and
consider
,
whither
it
may
not
be
worth
while
to
take
some
pain
to
vindicate
themselves
from
the
reproach
that
,
on
this
account
,
they
bear
among
their
neighbour
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
surpise
height
of
their
house
,
it
be
absurd
in
many
respect
;
but
in
one
particular
light
I
can
not
view
it
without
horror
;
that
is
,
the
dreadful
situation
of
all
the
family
above
,
in
case
the
common
stair
case
should
be
render
impassible
by
a
fire
in
the
low
story
  
<EOS>
in
order
to
prevent
the
shocking
consequence
that
must
attend
such
an
accident
,
it
would
be
a
right
measure
to
open
door
of
communication
from
one
house
to
another
,
on
every
story
,
by
which
the
people
may
fly
from
such
a
terrible
visitation
.
<EOS>
in
all
part
of
the
world
,
we
see
the
force
of
habit
prevail
over
all
the
dictate
of
convenience
and
sagacity
  
<EOS>
all
the
people
of
business
at
Edinburgh
,
and
even
the
genteel
company
,
may
be
see
stand
in
crowd
every
day
,
from
one
to
two
in
the
afternoon
,
in
the
open
street
,
at
a
place
where
formerly
stand
a
market
-
cross
,
which
(
by
the
bye
)
be
a
curious
piece
of
Gothick
architecture
,
still
to
be
see
in
lord
Sommerville
's
garden
in
this
neighbourhood
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
the
people
stand
in
the
open
street
from
the
force
of
custom
,
rather
than
move
a
few
yard
to
an
Exchange
that
stand
empty
on
one
side
,
or
to
the
parliament
-
close
on
the
other
,
which
be
a
noble
square
,
adorn
with
a
fine
equestrian
statute
of
king
Charles
II
.
  
<EOS>
the
company
thus
assemble
,
be
entertain
with
a
variety
of
tune
,
play
upon
a
set
of
bell
,
fix
in
a
steeple
hard
by
  
as
these
bell
be
well

tone
,
and
the
musician
,
who
have
a
salary
from
the
city
,
for
play
upon
them
with
key
,
be
no
bad
performer
,
the
entertainment
be
really
agreeable
,
and
very
striking
to
the
ear
of
a
stranger
.
    
<EOS>
the
public
inn
of
Edinburgh
,
be
still
bad
than
those
of
London
;
but
by
mean
of
a
worthy
gentleman
,
to
whom
I
be
recommend
,
we
have
get
decent
lodging
in
the
house
of
a
widow
gentlewoman
,
of
the
name
of
Lockhart
;
and
here
I
shall
stay
until
I
have
see
every
thing
that
be
remarkable
in
and
about
this
capital
.
<EOS>
I
now
begin
to
feel
the
good
effect
of
exercise
  
<EOS>
I
eat
like
a
farmer
,
sleep
from
mid

night
till
eight
in
the
morning
without
interruption
,
and
enjoy
a
constant
tide
of
spirit
,
equally
distant
from
inanition
and
excess

but
whatever
ebb
or
flow
my
constitution
may
undergo

my

and
<EOS>
so
I
let

put

but
a
mischievous
mob
of

such
promiscous

that

their

attack

not

<EOS>
They
cost
me
seven
good

to

<EOS>
when
I
axe
Mr

what
they
mean
by
call
me
Issabel
,
he
put
the
byebill
into
my
hand
,
and
I
read
of

that
be
throw
out
of
a

and
the

come

<EOS>
but
I
be

,
with
God

no

shall
have
my
poor

to
lick

marry

<EOS>
Heaven

amen

<EOS>
as
for
Ditton
,
after
all
his
courting
,
and
his
compliment
,
he
steal
away
an
Irishman
's
bride
,
and
take
a
french
leave
of
me
and
his

;
but
I
vally
not
his
go

but
I
have
have
hanger
on

account
  
<EOS>
Mistress
scoulde
like
mad

thof
I
have
the
comfit
that
all
the

take
my

and
even
Mr

plead
for
me
on
his

thof
,
God

he

he

abound

and
one

will
meet

<EOS>
and
now
,
dear
Mary
,
we
have
get
to
Haddingborrough
,
among
the
Scots
,
who
be
civil
enuff
for
our
money
,
thof
<EOS>
I
do
not
speak
their
lingo
  
<EOS>
but
they
should
not
go
for
to
impose
upon
foreigner
;
for
the
bill
in
their
house
say
,
they
have
different
easement
to
let
;
and
behold
there
be
nurro
geak
in
the
whole
kingdom
,
nor
any
thing
for
poor
servant
,
but
a
barrel
with
a
pair
of
tong
throw
a
cross
;
and
all
the
chair
in
the

be
empty
into
this

barrel
once
aday

and
at
ten
o'clock
at

the
whole
cargo
be
fling
out

look

and
the

call
gardy

to

which
signify
Lord
have
mercy
upon
you
!
<EOS>
and
this
be
do
every
night
in
every
house
in
Haddingborrough
;
so
you
may
guess
,
Mary
Jones
,
what
a
sweet
savour
come
from
such
a
number
of
profume
pan
;
but
they
say
it
be
wholesome
,
and
,
truly
,
I
believe
it
be
;
for
be
in
the
vapour
,
and
thinking
of
Issabel
and
Mr
Clinker
,
I
be
go
into
a
fit
of
asterick
,
<EOS>
when
this

save
your

,
take
me
by
the
nose
so
powerfully
that
I
sneeze
three
time
,
and
find
myself
wonderfully
refresh
;
and
this
to
be
sure
be
the
raisin
why
there
be
no
fit
in
Haddingborrough
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
likewise
make
believe
,
that
there
be
nothing
to
be
have
oat
-
meal
and
seep
-
head
;
but
if
I
have
not
be
a
fool
,
I
mought
have
know
there
could
be
no
head
without
kerkasse
  
<EOS>
this
very
blessed
day
I
dine
upon
a
delicate
leg
of
Velsh
mutton
and
cully

and
as
for
the
oat

meal
,
I
leave
that

<EOS>
Mr

tell
me
here

there

and
attentive
in
their
civility
to
stranger
,
that
I
be
insensibly
suck
into
the
channel
of
their
manner
and
custom
,
although
they
be
in
fact
much
more
different
from
our
than
you
can
imagine
  
<EOS>
that
difference
,
however
,
which
strike
me
very
much
at
my
first
arrival
,
I
now
hardly
perceive
,
and
my
ear
be
perfectly
reconcile
to
the
Scotch
accent
,
which
I
find
even
agreeable
in
the
mouth
of
a
pretty
woman
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
sort
of
doric
dialect
,
which
give
an
idea
of
amiable
simplicity
  
<EOS>
You
can
not
imagine
how
we
have
be
caress
and
feast
in
the
good
town
of
Edinburgh
,
of
which
we
be
become
free
denizen
and
guild

by
the
special

<EOS>
I

Quin
understand
our
intention
to
visit
Edinburgh

pull
out

me
with

<EOS>
He

myself
extremely
happy

do
Mr

and
Quin
all
the
justice
in
my
power
;
<EOS>
but
,
alas
,
I
be
no
more
than
a
tiro
among
a
troop
of
veteran
,
who
have
compassion
upon
my
youth
,
and
convey
me
home
in
the
morning
,
by
what
mean
I
know
not
  
<EOS>
Quin
be
mistaken
,
however
,
as
to
the

the
claret
be
too
good
to
treat
me
so
roughly

<EOS>
while
Mr

among

with
a
great

have
a
certain
shrewdness

self

command
that

exultation
  
not

escape
a
Scotchman
that
can
be

interpret
into
offence
by
any
individual
in
the
company
;
and
national
reflection
be
never
hear
  
<EOS>
in
this
particular
,
I
must
own
,
we
be
both
unjust
and
ungrateful
to
the
Scots
;
<EOS>
for
,
as
far
as
I
be
able
to
judge
,
the
have
a
real
esteem
for
,
the
native
of
South
-
Britain
:
and
never
mention
our
country
,
but
with
expression
of
regard
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
they
be
far
from
be
servile
imitator
of
our
mode
and
fashionable
vice
.
<EOS>
all
their
custom
and
regulation
of
public

private
oeconomy
,
of
business

diversion

be
in
their
own
stile

<EOS>
this
remarkably
predominate
in
their
look
,
their
dress
,
and
manner
,
their
music
,
and
even
their
cookery
.
<EOS>
Our
"
squire
declare
,
that
he
know
not
another
people
upon
earth
,
so
strongly
marked
with
a
national
character
  
<EOS>
now
we
be
upon
the
article
of
cookery
,
I
must
own
,
some
of
their
dish
be
savoury
,
and
even
delicate
;
but
I
be
not
yet
Scotchman
enough
to
relish
their
singed
sheep'
-
head
and
haggice
,
which
be
provide
at
our
request
,
one
day
at
Mr
Mitchelson
's
,
where
we
dine
  
the
first
put
me
in
mind
of
the
history
of
Congo
,
in
which
I
have
read
of
negro
's
head
sell
publickly
in
the
market
;
the
last
,
be
a
mess
of
mince
light
,
liver
,
suet
,
oat
-
meal
,
onion
,
and
pepper
,
inclose
in
a
sheep
's
stomach
,
have
a
very
sudden
effect
upon
mine
,
and
the
delicate
Mrs
Tabby
changed
colour
;
when
the
cause
of
our
disgust
be
instantaneously
remove
at
the
nod
of
our
entertainer
.
<EOS>
the
Scots
in
general
,
be
attach
to
this
composition
,
with
a
sort
of
national
fondness
,
as
well
as
to
their
oat
-
meal
bread
;
which
be
present
at
every
table
,
in
thin
triangular
cake
,
bake
upon
a
plate
of
iron
,
call
a
gridle
;
and
these
,
many
of
the
native
,
even
in
the
high
rank
of
like
,
prefer
to
wheaten
-
bread
,
which
they
have
here
in
perfection
  
<EOS>
You
know
we
use
to
vex
poor
Murray
of
Baliol
-
college
,
by
ask
,
if
there
be
really
no
fruit
but
turnip
in
Scotland
?
  
<EOS>
sure
enough
,
I
have
see
turnip
make
their
appearance
,
not
as
a
desert
,
but
by
way
of
hor
d
'
oeuvre
,
or
whet
,
as
radish
be
serve
up
betwixt
more
substantial
dish
in
France
and
Italy
;
but
it
must
be
observe
,
that
the
turnip
of
this
country
be
as
much
superior
in
sweetness
,
delicacy
,
and
flavour
,
to
those
of
England
,
as
a
musk
-
melon
be
to
the
stock
of
a
common
cabbage
.
<EOS>
They
be
small
and
conical
,
of
a
yellowish
colour
,
with
a
very
thin
skin
;
and
,
over
and
above
their
agreeable
taste
,
be
valuable
for
their
antiscorbutic
quality
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
fruit
now
in
season
,
such
as
cherry
,
gooseberry
,
and
currant
,
there
be
no
want
of
them
at
Edinburgh
;
and
in
the
garden
of
some
gentleman
,
who
live
in
this
neighbourhood
,
there
be
now
a
very
favourable
appearance
of
apricot
,
peach
,
nectarine
,
and
even
grape
:
<EOS>
nay
,
I
have
see
a
very
fine
shew
of
pine
-
apple
within
a
few
mile
of
this
metropolis
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
we
have
no
reason
to
be
surprised
at
these
particular
,
when
we
consider
how
little
difference
there
be
,
in
fact
,
betwixt
<EOS>
this
climate
and
that
of
London
.
    
<EOS>
all
the
remarkable
place
in
the
city
and
its
avenue
,
for
ten
mile
around
,
we
have
visit
,
much
to
our
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
in
the
Castle
be
some
royal
apartment
,
where
the
sovereign
occasionally
reside
;
and
here
be
carefully
preserve
the
regalia
of
the

,
consist
of
a
crown
,
<EOS>
say
to
be
of
great
value
,
a
sceptre
,
and
a
sword
of
state
,
adorn
with
jewel
  
of
these

the
people
be
exceedingly
jealous
  
<EOS>
a
report
be
spread
,
during
the
sitting
of
the
union

parliament
,
that
they
be
remove
to
London
,
such
a
tumult
arise
,
that
the
lord
commissioner
would
have
be
tear
in
piece

if
he

produce
them
for
the
satisfaction
of
the

<EOS>
the
palace
of
Holyrood

house
be
an
elegant
piece
of
architecture
,
but
sink
in
an
obscure
,
and
as
I
take
it
,
unwholesome
bottom
,
where
one
would
imagine
it
have
be
place
on
purpose
to
be
conceal
.
<EOS>
the
apartment
be
lofty
,
but
unfurnished
;
and
as
for
the
picture
of
the
scottish
king
,
from
Fergus
I
,
to
king
William

they
be
paultry
daubing

mostly
by

paint
either
from

or
porter

<EOS>
all
the
diversion
of
London
we
enjoy
at
Edinburgh
,
in
a
small
compass

<EOS>
here
be
a

in
which

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
every

you

and
there
be
one
nobleman
,
whose
composition
be
universally
admired
  
Our
company
of
actor
be
very
tolerable

and
a
subscription
be
now
on
foot
for
build
a
new
theatre

but
their
assembly
please
me
above
all
other
publick
exhibition
.
    
<EOS>
We
have
be
at
the
hunter
ball
,
where
I
be
really
astonished
to
see
such
a
number
of
fine
woman
  
<EOS>
the
English
,
who
have
never
cross
the
Tweed
,
imagine
erroneously
,
that
the
Scotch
lady
be
not
remarkable
for
personal
attraction
;
but
,
I
can
declare
with
a
safe
conscience
,
I
never
see
so
many
handsome
female
together
,
as
be
assemble
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
at
the
Leith
race
,
the
good
company
come
hither
from
the
remoter
province
;
so
that
,
I
suppose
,
we
have
all
the
beauty
of
the
kingdom
concentrate
as
it
be
into
one
focus
;
which
be
,
indeed
,
so
vehement
,
that
my
heart
could
hardly
resist
its
power
  
between
friend
,
it
have
sustain
some
damage
from
the
bright
eye
of
the
charming
miss
R####n
,
whom
I
have
the
honour
to
dance
with
at
the
ball
  
<EOS>
the
countess
of
Melvile
attract
all
eye
,
and
the
admiration
of
all
present
  
<EOS>
She
be
accompany
by
the
agreeable
miss
Grieve
,
who
make
many
conquest
;
nor
do
my
sister
Liddy
pass
unnoticed
in
the
assembly
  
<EOS>
She
be
become
a
toast
at
Edinburgh
,
by
the
name
of
the
Fair
Cambrian
,
and
have
already
be
the
occasion
of
much
wine
-
shed
;
but
the
poor
girl
meet
with
an
accident
at
the
ball
,
which
have
give
us
great
disturbance
.
    
<EOS>
a
young
gentleman
,
the
express
image
of
that
rascal
Wilson
,
go
up
to
ask
her
to
dance
a
minuet
;
and
his
sudden
appearance
shock
her
so
much
,
that
she
faint
away
  
<EOS>
I
call
Wilson
a
rascal
,
because
,
if
he
have
be
really
a
gentleman
,
with
honourable
intention
,
he
would
have
,
ere
now
,
appear
in
his
own
character
  
<EOS>
I
must
own
,
my
blood
boil
's
with
indignation
when
I
think
of
that
fellow
's
presumption
;
and
Heaven
confound
me
if
I
do
not
  
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
be
so
womanish
as
to
rail
  
<EOS>
Time
will
,
perhaps
,
furnish
occasion
  
<EOS>
thank
God
,
<EOS>
the
cause
of
Liddy
's
disorder
remain
a
secret
.
<EOS>
the
lady
directress
of
the
ball
,
think
she
be
overcome
by
the
heat
of
the
place
,
and
her
convey
to
another
room
,
where
she
soon
recover
so
well
,
as
to
return
and
join
in
the
country
-
dance
,
in
which
the
Scotch
lass
acquit
themselves
with
such
spirit
and
agility
,
as
put
their
partner
to
the
height
of
their
mettle
  
<EOS>
I
believe
our
aunt
,
Mrs
Tabitha
,
have
entertain
hope
of
be
able
to
do
some
execution
among
the
cavalier
at
this
assembly
  
<EOS>
She
have
be
several
day
in
consultation
with
milliner
and
mantuamaker
,
prepare
for
the
occasion
,
at
which
she
make
her
appearance
in
a
full
suit
of
damask
,
so
thick
and
heavy
,
that
the
sight
of
it
alone
,
at
this
season
of
the
year
,
be
sufficient
to
draw
drop
of
sweat
from
any
man
of
ordinary
imagination
  
<EOS>
She
dance
one
minuet
with
our
friend
,
Mr
Mitchelson
,
who
favour
her
so
far
,
in
the
spirit
of
hospitality
and
politeness
;
and
she
be
call
out
a
second
time
by
the
young
laird
of
Ballymawhawple
,
who
,
come
in
by
accident
,
could
not
readily
find
any
other
partner
;
but
as
the
first
be
a
married
man
,
and
the
second
pay
no
particular
homage
to
her
charm
,
which
be
also
over
-
look
by
the
rest
of
the
company
,
she
become
dissatisfied
and
censorious
  
<EOS>
at
supper
,
she
observe
that
the
Scotch
gentleman
make
a
very
good
figure
,
when
they
be
a
little
improve
by
travel
;
and
therefore
it
be
pity
they
do
not
all
take
the
benefit
of
go
abroad
  
<EOS>
She
say
the
woman
be
aukward
,
masculine
creature
;
that
,
in
dancing
,
they
lift
their
leg
like
so
many
colt
;
that
they
have
no
idea
of
graceful
motion
,
and
put
on
their
clothe
in
a
frightful
manner
;
but
if
the
truth
must
be
tell
,
Tabby
herself
be
the
most
ridiculous
figure
,
and
the
bad
dressed
of
the
whole
assembly
  
<EOS>
the
neglect
of
the
male
sex
render
her
malcontent
and
peevish
;
she
now
find
fault
with
every
thing
at
Edinburgh
,
and
teize
her
brother
to
leave
the
place
,
when
she
be
suddenly
reconcile
to
it
on
a
religous
consideration
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
sect
of
fanatick
,
who
have
separate
themselves
from
the
establish
kirk
,
under
the
name
of
seceder
  
<EOS>
They
acknowledge
no
earthly
head
of
the
church
,
reject
lay
-
patronage
,
and
maintain
the
methodist
doctrine
of
the
new
birth
,
the
new
light
,
the
efficacy
of
grace
,
the
insufficiency
of
work
,
and
the
operation
of
the
spirit
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
,
attend
by
Humpry
Clinker
,
be
introduce
to
one
of
their
conventicle
,
where
they
both
receive
much
edification
;
and
she
have
have
the
good
fortune
to
come
acquaint
with
a
pious
Christian
,
call
Mr
Moffat
,
who
be
very
powerful
in
prayer
,
and
often
assist
her
in
private
exercise
of
devotion
.
    
<EOS>
I
never
see
such
a
concourse
of
genteel
company
at
any
race
in
England
,
as
appear
on
the
course
of
Leith
  
hard
by
,
in
the
field
call
the
Links
,
the
citizen
of
Edinburgh
divert
themselves
at
a
game
call
golf
,
in
which
they
use
a
curious
kind
of
bat
,
tipt
with
horn
,
and
small
elastic
ball
of
leather
,
stuff
with
feather
,
rather
less
than
tennis
ball
,
but
of
a
much
hard
consistence
  
this
they
strike
with
such
force
and
dexterity
from
one
hole
to
another
,
that
they
will
fly
to
an
incredible
distance
.
<EOS>
of
this
diversion
the
Scots
be
so
fond
,
that
when
the
weather
will
permit
,
you
may
see
a
multitude
of
all
rank
,
from
the
senator
of
justice
to
the
low
tradesman
,
mingle
together
in
their
shirt

and
follow
the

with
the
utmost
eagerness
  
among

I

They
be
all
gentleman
of
independent
fortune

who
have
amuse
themselves
with
this
pastime
for
the
good
part
of
a
century
,
without
have
ever
feel
the
least
alarm
from
sickness
or
disgust
;
and
they
never
go
to

without
have
each
the
good

a
gallon
of
claret
in
his

such

the
Leith
race
give
occasion
to
another
entertainment
of
a
very
singular
nature
  
<EOS>
there
be
at
Edinburgh
a
society

corporation

wonderfully
acute

and
so
note
for
fidelity

that
there
be
no
instance
of
a
cawdy

betray
his

<EOS>
such
be
their
intelligence
,
that
they
know

not

every
individual
of
the
place
,
but
also
every
stranger
,
by
that
time
he
have
be
four
and
twenty
hour
in
Edinburgh
;
and
no
transaction
,
even
the
most
private
,
can
escape
their
notice
  
<EOS>
They
be
particularly
famous
for
their
dexterity
in
execute
one
of
the
function
of
Mercury
;
though
,
for
my
own
part

I
never
employ
them
in
this
department
of

<EOS>
have
I
occasion

my

Archy
M'Alpine
,
be
as
well
qualified
as
e'er
<EOS>
a
cawdie
in
Edinburgh

and
I
be
much
mistaken
,
if
he
have
not
be
heretofore
of
their
fraternity

<EOS>
be
that
as
it
may
,
they
resolve
to
give
a
dinner

at
Leith

to
which
they
formally
invite
all
the

this
invitation
be
reinforce
by
an
assurance
that
all
the
celebrated

pleasure
would
grace
the
entertainment
with
their
company

<EOS>
I
receive
a

and
other

off

You

<EOS>
as

"
<EOS>
He
be
forthwith
elect
into
the
chair
,
and
compliment
in
a
bumper
in
his
new
character
.
    
<EOS>
the
claret
continue
to
circulate
without
interruption
,
till
the
glass
seem
to
dance
upon
the
table
,
and
this
,
perhaps
,
be
a
hint
to
the
lady
to
call
for
music
  
<EOS>
at
eight
in
the
evening
the
ball
begin
in
another
apartment
:
at
midnight
we
go
to
supper
;
but
it
be
broad
day
before
I
find
the
way
to
my
lodging
;
and
,
no
doubt
,
his
lordship
have
a
swinging
bill
to
discharge
.
    
<EOS>
in
short
;
I
have
live
so
riotously
for
some
week
,
that
my
uncle
begin
to
be
alarm
on
the
score
of
my
constitution
,
and
very
seriously
observe
,
that
all
his
own
infirmity
be
owe
to
such
excess
indulge
in
his
youth
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
say
it
would
be
more
for
the
advantage
of
my
soul
as
well
as
body
,
if
,
instead
of
frequent
these
scene
of
debauchery
,
I
would
accompany
Mr
Moffat
and
her
to
hear
a
sermon
of
the
reverend
Mr
M'Corkindale
.
  
<EOS>
Clinker
often
exhort
me
,
with
a
groan
,
to
take
care
of
my
precious
health
;
and
even
Archy
M'Alpine
,
when
he
happen
to
be
overtaken
,
(
which
be
oftener
the
case
than
I
could
wish
)
read
me
a
long
lecture
upon
temperance
and
sobriety
;
and
be
so
very
wise
and
sententious
,
that
,
if
I
could
provide
him
with
a
professor
's
chair
,
I
would
willingly
give
up
the
benefit
of
his
admonition
and
service
together
;
for
I
be
tutorsick
at
alma
mater
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
not
,
however
,
so
much
engross
by
the
gaiety
of
Edinburgh
,
but
that
I
find
time
to
make
party
in
the
family
way
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
not
only
see
all
the
villa
and
village
within
ten
mile
of
the
capital
,
but
we
have
also
cross
the
Firth
,
which
be
an
arm
of
the
sea
seven
mile
broad
,
that
divide
Lothian
from
the
shire
,
or
,
as
the
Scots
call
it
,
the
kingdom
of
Fife
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
number
of
large
open
sea
-
boat
that
ply
on
this
passage
from
Leith
to
Kinghorn
,
which
be
a
borough
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
in
one
of
these
our
whole
family
embark
three
day
ago
,
except
my
sister
,
who
,
be
exceedingly
fearful
of
the
water
,
be
leave
to
the
care
of
Mrs
Mitchelson
.
<EOS>
We
have
an
easy
and
quick
passage
into
Fife
,
where
we
visit
a
number
of
poor
town
on
the
sea
-
side
,
include
St.
Andrew
's
,
which
be
the
skeleton
of
a
venerable
city
;
but
we
be
much
better
pleased
with
some
noble
and
elegant
seat
and
castle
,
of
which
there
be
a
great
number
in
that
part
of
Scotland
.
<EOS>
yesterday
we
take
boat
again
on
our
return
to
Leith
with
fair
wind
and
agreeable
weather
;
but
we
have
not
advance
half
-
way
when
the
sky
be
suddenly
overcast
,
and
the
wind
change
.
<EOS>
blew
directly
in
our
tooth
;
so
that
we
be
oblige
to
turn
,
or
tack
the
rest
,
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
the
gale
increase
to
a
storm
of
wind
and
rain
,
attend
with
such
a
fog
,
that
we
could
not
see
the
town
of
Leith
,
to
which
we
be
bind
,
nor
even
the
castle
of
Edinburgh
,
notwithstanding
its
high
situation
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
doubt
but
that
we
be
all
alarm
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
and
at
the
same
time
,
most
of
the
passenger
be
seize
with
a
nausea
that
produce
violent
retching
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
desire
her
brother
to
order
the
boatman
to
put
back
to
Kinghorn
,
and
this
expedient
he
actually
propose
;
but
they
assure
him
there
be
no
danger
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
find
them
obstinate
,
begin
to
scold
,
and
insist
upon
my
uncle
's
exert
his
authority
as
a
justice
of
the
peace
.
<EOS>
sick
and
peevish
as
he
be
,
he
could
not
help
laugh
at
this
wise
proposal
,
tell
her
,
that
his
commission
do
not
extend
so
far
,
and
,
if
it
do
,
he
should
let
the
people
take
their
own
way
;
for
he
think
it
would
be
great
presumption
in
him
to
direct
them
in
the
exercise
of
their
own
profession
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Winifred
Jenklns
make
a
general
clearance
with
the
assistance
of
Mr
Humphry
Clinker
,
who
join
her
both
in
prayer
and
ejaculation
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
take
it
for
grant
that
we
should
not
be
long
in
this
world
,
he
offer
some
spiritual
consolation
to
Mrs
Tabitha
,
who
reject
it
with
great
disgust
,
bid
him
keep
his
sermon
for
those
who
have
leisure
to
hear
such
nonsense
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
sit
,
recollect
in
himself
,
without
speak
;
my
man
Archy
have
recourse
to
a
brandy
-
bottle
,
with
which
he
make
so
free
,
that
I
imagine
he
have
swear
to
die
of
drink
any
thing
rather
than
sea
-
water
:
but
the
brandy
have
no
more
effect
upon
him
in
the
way
of
intoxication
,
than
if
it
have
be
sea
water
in
good
earnest
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
myself
,
I
be
too
much
engross
by
the
sickness
at
my
stomach
,
to
think
of
any
thing
else
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
the
sea
swell
mountain
high
,
the
boat
pitch
with
such
violence
,
as
if
it
have
be
go
to
piece
;
the
cordage
rattle
,
the
wind
roar
;
the
lightning
flash
,
the
thunder
bellow
,
and
the
rain
descend
in
a
deluge
  
<EOS>
every
time
the
vessel
be
put
about
,
we
ship'd
<EOS>
a
sea
that
drench
us
all
to
the
skin
.
  
<EOS>
when
by
dint
of
turning
,
we
think
to
have
clear
the
pier
head
,
we
be
drive
to
leeward
,
and
then
the
boatman
themselves
begin
to
fear
that
the
tide
would
fail
before
we
should
fetch
up
our
lee
-
way
:
the
next
trip
,
however
,
bring
us
into
smooth
water
,
and
we
be
safely
land
on
the
quay
,
about
one
o'clook
in
the
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
(
cry
Tabby
,
when
she
find
herself
on
terra

<EOS>
we
must
all
have
perish
,
if
we
have
not
be
the
particular
care
of
Providence
.
  
<EOS>
yes
,
(
reply
my
uncle
)
but
I
be
much
of
the
honest
highlander
's
mind
 
after
he
have
make
such
a
passage
as
this
:
his
friend
tell
him
he
be
much
indebted
to
Providence
;
  
certainly
,
(
say
Donald
)
but
,
by
my
saul
,
mon
,
I'se
ne'er
trouble
Providence
again
,
so
long
as
the
brig
of
Stirling
stand
.
<EOS>
"
  
You
must
know
the
brig
,
or
bridge
of
Stirling
,
stand
above
twenty
mile
up
the
river
Forth

of
which
this
be
the
outlet
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
find
that
our

squire
have
suffer
in
his
health
from
this
adventure
;
but
poor
Liddy
be
in
a
peak
way
  
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
this
unfortunate
girl
be
uneasy
in
her
mind

and
this
apprehension
distract
me
,
for
she
be
really
an
amiable
creature

<EOS>
We
shall
set
out
to

morrow
or
next
day
for
Stirling
and
Glasgow
;
and
we
propose
to
penetrate
a
little
way
into
the
Highlands
,
before
we
turn
our
course
to
the
southward
  
<EOS>
in

<EOS>
I
SHOULD
be
very
ungrateful
,
dear
Lewis
,
if
I
do
not
find
myself
disposed
to
think
and
speak
favourably
of
this
people
,
among
whom
I
have
meet
with
more
kindness

hospitality

and
rational
entertainment
,
in
a
few
week
,
than
ever
I
receive
in
any
other
country
during
the
whole
course
of
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
,
the
gratitude
excite
by
these
benefit
may
interfere
with
the
impartiality
of
my
remark
;
for
a
man
be
as
apt
to
be
prepossess
by
particular
favour
as
to
be
prejudice
by
private
motive
of
disgust

<EOS>
if
I
be
partial
,
there
be
,
at

,
some
merit
in
my
conversion
from
illiberal
prejudice
which
have
grow
up
with
my
constitution
.
    
<EOS>
the
first
impression
which
an
Englishman
receive
in
this
country
,
will
not
contribute
to
the
removal
of
his
prejudice
;
because
he
refer
every
thing
he
see
to
a
comparison
with
the
same
article
in
his
own
country
;
and
this
comparison
be
unfavourable
to
Scotland
in
all
its
exterior
,
such
as
the
face
of
the
country
in
respect
to
cultivation
,
the
appearance
of
the
bulk
of
the
people
,
and
the
language
of
conversation
in
general
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
so
far
convince
by
Mr
Lismahago
's
argument
,
buttl
at
<EOS>
I
think
the
Scots
would
do
well
,
for
their
own
sake
,
to
adopt
the
english
idiom
and
pronunciation
;
those
of
them
especially
,
who
be
resolve
to
push
their
fortune
in
South
-
Britain
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
,
by
experience
,
how
easily
an
Englishman
be
influence
by
the
ear
,
and
how
apt
he
be
to
laugh
,
when
he
hear
his
own
language
speak
with
a
foreign
or
provincial
accent
  
I
have
know
a
member
of
the
house
of
common
speak
with
great
energy
and
precision
,
without
be
able
to
engage
attention
,
because
his
observation
be
make
in
the
Scotch
dialect
,
which
(
no
offence
to
lieutenant
Lismahago
)
certainly
give
a
clownish
air
even
to
sentiment
of
the
great
dignity
and
decorum
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
declare
my
opinion
on
this
head
to
some
of
the
most
sensible
man
of
this
country
,
observe
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
if
they
would
employ
a
few
native
of
England
to
teach
the
pronunciation
of
our
vernacular
tongue
,
in
twenty
year
there
would
be
no
difference
,
in
point
of
dialect
,
between
the
youth
of
Edinburgh
and
of
London
.
    
<EOS>
the
civil
regulation
of
this
kingdom
and
metropolis
be
take
from
very
different
model
from
those
of
England
,
except
in
a
few
particular
establishment
,
the
necessary
consequence
of
the
union
.
  
<EOS>
Their
college
of
justice
be
a
bench
of
great
dignity
,
fill
with
judge
of
character
and
ability
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
hear
some
cause
try
before
this
venerable
tribunal
;
and
be
very
much
pleased
with
the
pleading
of
their
advocate
,
who
be
by
no
mean
deficient
either
in
argument
or
elocution
.
<EOS>
the
scottish
legislation
be
found
,
in
a
great
measure
,
on
the
civil
law
;
consequently
,
their
proceeding
vary
from
those
of
the
english
tribunal
;
but
,
I
think
,
they
have
the
advantage
of
us
in
their
method
of
examine
witness
apart
,
and
in
the
constitution
of
their
jury
,
by
which
they
certainly
avoid
the
evil
which
I
mention
in
my
last
from
Lismahago
's
observation
.
    
<EOS>
the
university
of
Edinburgh
be
supply
with
excellent
professor
in
all
the
science
;
and
the
medical
school
,
in
particular
,
be
famous
all
over
Europe
.
  
<EOS>
the
student
of
this
art
have
the
good
opportunity
of
learn
it
to
perfection
,
in
all
its
branch
,
as
there
be
different
course
for
the
theory
of
medicine
,
and
the
practice
of
medicine
;
for
anatomy
,
chemistry
,
botany
,
and
the
materia
medica
,
over
and
above
those
of
mathematic
and
experimental
philosophy
;
and
all
these
be
give
by
man
of
distinguished
talent
.
<EOS>
what
render
this
part
of
education
still
more
complete
,
be
the
advantage
of
attend
the
infirmary
,
which
be
the
best
institute
charitable
foundation
that
I
ever
know
.
<EOS>
now
we
be
talk
of
charity
,
here
be
several
hospital
,
exceedingly
well
endowed
,
and
maintain
under
admirable
regulation
;
and
these
be
not
only
useful
,
but
ornamental
to
the
city
.
<EOS>
among
these
,
I
shall
only
mention
the
general
work
-
house
,
in
which
all
the
poor
,
not
otherwise
provide
for
,
be
employ
,
accord
to
their
different
ability
,
with
such
judgment
and
effect
,
that
they
nearly
maintain
themselves
by
their
labour
,
and
there
be
not
a
beggar
to
be
see
within
the
precinct
of
this
metropolis
.
<EOS>
It
be
Glasgow
that
set
the
example
of
this
establishment
,
abour
thirty
year
ago
.
  
<EOS>
even
the
kirk
of
Scotland
,
so
long
reproach
with
fanaticism
and
canting
,
abound
at
present
with
minister
celebrate
for
their
learning
,
and
respectable
for
their
moderation
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
hear
their
sermon
with
equal
astonishment
and
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
the
good
people
of
Edinburgh
no
longer
think
dirt
and
cob
-
webs
essential
to
the
house
of
god
.
  
<EOS>
some
of
their
church
have
admit
such
ornament
as
would
have
excited
sedition
,
even
in
England
,
a
little
more
than
a
century
ago
;
and
psalmody
be
here
practise
and
teach
by
a
professor
from
the
cathedral
of
Durham
:
  
<EOS>
I
should
not
be
surprised
,
in
a
few
year
,
to
hear
it
accompany
with
an
organ
.
    
<EOS>
Edinburgh
be
a
hot
-
bed
of
genius
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
have
the
good
fortune
to
be
make
acquaint
with
many
author
of
the
first
distinction
;
such
as
the
two
Humes
,
Robertson
,
Smith
,
Wallace
,
Blair
,
Ferguson
,
Wilkie
,
&
c.
<EOS>
and
I
have
find
them
all
as
agreeable
in
conversation
as
they
be
instructive
and
entertaining
in
their
writing
.
<EOS>
these
acquaintance
I
owe
to
the
friendship
of
Dr
Carlyle
,
who
want
nothing
but
inclination
to
figure
with
the
rest
upon
paper
.
<EOS>
the
magistracy
of
Edinburgh
be
change
every
year
by
election
,
and
seem
to
be
very
well
adapt
both
for
state
and
authority
.
  
<EOS>
the
lord
provost
be
equal
in
dignity
to
the
lord
mayor
of
London
;
and
the
four
bailie
be
equivalent
to
the
rank
of
alderman
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
dean
of
guild
,
who
take
cognizance
of
mercantile
affair
;
a
treasurer
;
a
town
-
clerk
;
and
the
council
be
compose
of
deacon
,
one
of
whom
be
return
every
year
,
in
rotation
,
as
representative
of
every
company
of
artificer
or
handicraftsman
.
<EOS>
though
this
city
,
from
the
nature
of
its
situation
,
can
never
be
make
either
very
convenient
or
very
cleanly
,
it
have
nevertheless
,
an
air
of
magnificence
that
command
respect
.
  
<EOS>
the
castle
be
an
instance
of
the
sublime
in
scite
and
architecture
.
  
<EOS>
Its
fortification
be
keep
in
good
order
,
and
there
be
always
in
it
a
garrison
of
regular
soldier
,
which
be
relieve
every
year
;
but
it
be
incapable
of
sustain
a
siege
carry
on
accord
to
the
modern
operation
of
war
.
  
<EOS>
the
castle
hill
,
which
extend
from
the
outward
gate
to
the
upper
end
of
the
high
-
street
,
be
use
as
a
public
walk
for
the
citizen
,
and
command
a
prospect
,
equally
extensive
and
delightful
,
over
the
county
of
Fife
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
Frith
,
and
all
along
the
sea
-
coast
,
which
be
cover
with
a
succession
of
town
that
would
seem
to
indicate
a
considerable
share
of
commerce
;
but
,
if
the
truth
must
be
tell
,
these
town
have
be
fall
to
decay
ever
since
the
union
,
by
which
the
Scots
be
in
a
great
measure
deprive
of
their
trade
with
France
.
  
<EOS>
the
palace
of
Holy
-
rood
-
house
be
a
jewel
in
architecture
,
thrust
into
a
hollow
where
it
can
not
be
see
;
a
situation
which
be
certainly
not
choose
by
the
ingenious
architect
,
who
must
have
be
confine
to
the
scite
of
the
old
palace
,
which
be
a
convent
.
<EOS>
Edinburgh
be
considerably
extend
on
the
south
side
,
where
there
be
diver
little
elegant
square
build
in
the
english
manner
;
and
the
citizen
have
plan
some
improvement
on
the
north
,
which
,
when
put
in
execution
,
will
add
greatly
to
the
beauty
and
convenience
of
this
capital
.
    
<EOS>
the
sea
-
port
be
Leith
,
a
flourishing
town
,
about
a
mile
from
the
city
in
the
harbour
of
which
I
have
see
above
one
hundred
ship
lie
all
together
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
I
have
the
curiosity
to
cross
the
Frith
in
a
passage
-
boat
,
and
stay
two
day
in
Fife
,
which
be
remarkably
fruitful
in
corn
,
and
exhibit
a
surprising
number
of
fine
seat
,
elegantly
build
,
and
magnificently
furnished
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
incredible
number
of
noble
house
in
every
part
of
Scotland
that
I
have
see
.
  
<EOS>
Dalkeith
,
Pinkie
,
Yester
and
lord
Hopton
's
,
all
of
them
within
four
or
five
mile
of
Edinburgh
,
be
princely
palace
,
in
every
one
of
which
a
sovereign
may
reside
at
his
ease
.
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
Scots
affect
these
monument
of
grandeur
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
may
be
allow
to
mingle
censure
with
my
remark
upon
a
people
I
revere
,
I
must
observe
,
that
their
weak
side
seem
to
be
vanity
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
that
even
their
hospitality
be
not
quite
free
of
ostentation
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
discover
among
them
uncommon
pain
take
to
display
their
fine
linen
,
of
which
,
indeed
,
they
have
great
plenty
,
their
furniture
,
plate
,
house
keeping
and
variety
of
wine
,
in
which
article
,
it
must
be
own
,
they
be
profuse
,
if
not
prodigal
.
  
<EOS>
a
burgher
of
Edinburgh
,
not
content
to
vie
with
a
citizen
of
London
,
who
have
ten
time
his
fortune
,
must
excel
him
in
the
expence
as
well
as
elegance
of
the
entertainment
.
    
<EOS>
though
the
villas
of
the
Scotch
nobility
and
gentry
have
generally
an
air
of
grandeur
and
state
,
I
think
their
garden
and
park
be
not
comparable
to
those
of
England
;
a
circumstance
the
more
remarkable
,
as
I
be
tell
by
the
ingenious
Mr
Phillip
Miller
of
Chelsea
,
that
almost
all
the
gardener
of
Souht
-
Britain
be
native
of
Scotland
.
<EOS>
the
verdure
of
this
country
be
not
equal
to
that
of
England
.
  
<EOS>
the
pleasure
ground
be
,
in
my
opinion
,
not
so
well
lay
out
accord
to
the
genius
loci
;
nor
be
the
lawn
,
and
walk
,
and
hedge
keep
in
such
delicate
order
.
  
<EOS>
the
tree
be
plant
in
prudish
row
,
which
have
not
such
an
agreeable
natural
effect
,
as
when
they
be
throw
into
irregular
groupe
,
with
intervene
glade
;
and
the
fir
,
which
they
generally
raise
around
their
house
,
look
dull
and
funeral
in
the
summer
season
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
confess
,
indeed
,
that
they
yield
serviceable
timber
,
and
good
shelter
against
the
northern
blast
;
that
they
grow
and
thrive
in
the
most
barren
soil
,
and
continually
perspire
a
fine
balsam
of
turpentine
,
which
must
render
the
air
very
salutary
and
sanative
to
the
lung
of
a
tender
texture
.
    
<EOS>
Tabby
and
I
have
be
both
frightne
in
our
return
by
sea
from
the
coast
of
Fife
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
afraid
of
drown
,
and
<EOS>
I
of
catch
cold
,
in
consequence
of
be
drench
with
sea
-
water
;
but
my
fear
,
as
well
as
her
be
,
have
be
happily
disappoint
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
now
in
perfect
health
;
I
wish
I
could
say
the
same
of
Liddy
.
  
<EOS>
something
uncommon
be
the
matter
with
that
poor
child
;
her
colour
fade
her
appetite
fail
,
and
her
spirit
flag
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
become
mope
and
melancholy
,
and
be
often
find
in
tear
.
  
<EOS>
Her
brother
suspect
internal
uneasiness
on
account
of
Wilson
,
and
denounce
vengeance
against
that
adventurer
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
,
it
seem
,
strongly
affected
at
the
ball
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
one
Mr
Gordon
,
who
strongly
resemble
the
say
Wilson
;
but
I
be
rather
suspicious
that
she
catch
cold
by
be
overheat
with
dancing
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
consult
Dr
Gregory
,
an
eminent
physician
of
an
amiable
character
,
who
advise
the
hiland
air
,
and
the
use
of
goat
-
milk
whey
,
which
,
surely
,
can
not
have
a
bad
effect
upon
a
patient
who
be
bear
and
breed
among
the
mountain
of
Wales
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
's
opinion
be
the
more
agreeable
,
as
we
shall
find
those
remedy
in
the
very
place
which
I
propose
as
the
utmost
extent
of
our
expedition
  
<EOS>
I
mean
the
border
of
Argyle
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Smollet
,
one
of
the
judge
of
the

court

which
be

very
kindly

our
lodging
at
his

on

about
fourteen
mile

<EOS>
for
this
last

we
shall
set
out
in

take

well
provide
with
recommendation
from
our

,
I
protest

I

leave
with
much

I
be
so
far

this
country

dear
knight

I
am
now
little
short
of
the
Ultima

,
if
this
appellation
properly
belong
to
the
Orkneys
or
Hebrides

these

the
most
picturesque
and
romantic
prospect
I

<EOS>
I
write
this
letter
in
a
gentleman
's
house
,
near
the
town
of
Inverary
,
which
may
be
deem
the
capital
of
the
West
Highlands
,
famous
for
nothing
so
much
as
for
the
stately
castle
begin
,
and
actually
cover
in
by
the
late
duke
of
Argyle
,
at
a
prodigious
expence
  
whether
it
will
ever
be
completely
finish
<EOS>
be
a
question
     
<EOS>
but
,
to
take
thing
in
order
.
  
<EOS>
We
leave
Edinburgh
ten
day
ago
;
and
the
further
North
we
proceed
,
we
find
Mrs
Tabitha
the
less
manageable
;
so
that
her
inclination
be
not
of
the
nature
of
the
loadstone
;
they
point
not
towards
the
pole
.
<EOS>
what
make
her
leave
Edinburgh
with
reluctance
at
last
,
if
we
may
believe
her
own
assertion
,
be
a
dispute
which
she
leave
unfinished
with
Mr
Moffat
,
touch
the
eternity
of
hell
torment
.
<EOS>
that
gentleman
,
as
he
advance
in
year
,
begin
to
be
sceptical
on
this
head
,
till
,
at
length
he
declare
open
war
against
the
common
acception
of
the
word
eternal
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
persuade
,
that
eternal
signifie
no
more
than
an
indefinite
number
of
year
;
and
that
the
most
enormous
sinner
may
be
quit
for
nine
million

nine
hundred

Mrs

revolt
at
this
dogma

which
fill
her
at

with
horror

indignation
  
<EOS>
She
have
recourse

of
Humphry

who
roundly
declare
it
be
the
popish
doctrine
of
purgatory

<EOS>
We
pass
through
Linlithgow

where
there
be
an
elegant
royal
palace
,
which
be
now
go
to
decay
,
as
well
as
the

itself
  
<EOS>
this
too
be
pretty
much
the
case
with
Stirling

though
it
still
boast
of
a
fine
old
castle
,
in
which
the
king
of
Scotland
be
will
not

reside
in
their
minority
  
<EOS>
but
Glasgow
be
the
pride
of
Scotland
,
and
,
indeed
,
it
may
very
well
pass
for
an
elegant

flourish
city
in
any
part
of
Christendom

<EOS>
there
we

the

an
eminent

truly

he
could
not

do
us
more
essential
service
  
<EOS>
Mr
Moore
be
a
merry
facetious
companion

sensible

shrewd

with
a
considerable
fund
of
humour

and
his
wife
an
agreeable

well
breed

kind

Kindness

which
I
take
to
be
the
essence

nature

be
the

the
Scotch

Our

shew
us
every

introduce
us
to
all
the
world
at
Glasgow

where
,
through
his
recommendation
,
we
be
compliment
with
the
freedom
of
the
town

<EOS>
consider
the
trade

opulence
of
this
place

it
can
not

abound
with
gaiety

diversion
  
<EOS>
here
be
a
great
number
of
young
fellow
that
rival
the
youth
of
the
capital

I
be
soon
convince
,
that
all
the
female
beauty
of
Scotland
be
not
assemble

ball
in
Edinburgh
  
<EOS>
the
town

Glasgow
flourish
in
learning

as
well

in

<EOS>
here
be
an
university

with
professor
in
all
the
different
branch
of
science

liberally
endow

judiciously
choose
  
<EOS>
It
be
vacation
time
when
I
pass
,
so
that
I
could
not
entirely
satisfy
my
curiosity
;
but
their
mode
of
education
be
certainly
preferable
to
ours
in
some
respect
  
the
student
be
not
leave
to
the
private
instruction
of
tutor
;
but
teach
in
public
school

class
,
each
science
by
its
particular
professor

regent

My

in
rapture
with
Glasgow
  
<EOS>
He
not

visit
all

make
excursion

I
believe
the

occasion

Maclellan

in
her
snare

but
when
matter
come
to
an
explanation

it
appear
that
his
attachment
be
altogether
spiritual

found
upon
an
intercourse
of
devotion
,
at
the
meeting
of
Mr
John
Wesley

who
,
in

his

have

Dumbarton

or
(
as
my

will
have
it
)
<EOS>
Dunbritton
,
where
there
be
a
castle
more
curious
than
any
thing
of
the
kind
I
have
ever
see
  
<EOS>
It
be
honour
with
a
particular
description
by
the
elegant
Buchannan
,
as
an
arx
inexpugnabilis
,
and
,
indeed
,
it
must
have
be
impregnable
by
the
ancient
manner
of
besieging
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
rock
of
considerable
extent

rise
with
a
double
top

in
an
angle

by
the
confluence
of

the

Highlands

in
the
form

huge

dusky

this
prospect
be
not

all
surprising
to
a
native
of
Glamorgan

We
have
fix
our

comissary
Smollet

where
we
find
every
sort

accommodation
we
could
desire
  
<EOS>
It

situate
like
a
Druid

temple
,
in
a
grove
of
oak
,
close
by
the
side
of
Lough

Lomond

which
be
a
surprising
body
of
pure
transparent
water

unfathomably
deep
in
many

six

seven
mile
broad

four

They

which
be
agreeably
romantic
beyond

conception

<EOS>
My
uncle
and
I
have
leave
the
woman
at
Cameron
,
as
Mrs
Tabitha
would
by
no
means
trust
herself
again
upon
the
water
,
and
to
come
hither
<EOS>
it
be
necessary
to
cross
a
small
inlet
of
the
sea
,
in
an
open
ferry

boat
  
<EOS>
this
country
appear
more
and
more
wild

savage
the
further
we
advance

and
the
people
be
as
different

Scots

in
their
look

<EOS>
when
the
Lowlanders
want

they

engrave
  
<EOS>
the
Highlanders
,
on
the
contrary

despise
this
liquor

and
regale
themselves
with
whisky
;
a
malt
spirit
,
as
strong
as
geneva
,
which
they
swallow
in
great
quantity
,
without
any
sign
of
inebriation

<EOS>
They
be
use
to
it
from
the

find
it
an
excellent
preservative
against
the
winter
cold

which
must

extreme

it

when
the

the
symptom
grow
unfavourable
  
the
Highlanders
be
use
to
eat
much
more
animal
food
than
fall
to
the
share
of
their
neighbour
in
the
low

country
  
<EOS>
They
delight
in
hunting
;
have
plenty
of
deer
and
other
game
,
with
a
great
number
of
sheep

goat
,
and
black
cattle
run
wild

Inverary

mighty
prince
in

<EOS>
the

live

so
love

a

run
some
risque

from
their
hospitality
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
observe
that
the
poor
highlander
be
now
see
to
disadvantage
  
<EOS>
They
have
be
not
only
disarm
by
act
of
parliament
;
but
also
deprive
of
their
ancient
garb
,
which
be
both
graceful
and
convenient
;
and
what
be
a
great
hardship
still
,
they
be
compel
to
wear
breech
;
a
restraint
which
they
can
not
bear
with
any
degree
of
patience

indeed
,
the

wear
them

not
in
the
proper
place

on
pole

long
stave
over
their

<EOS>
They

even
debar
the
use

their
stripe
stuff

call
Tartane

be
their

prize
by

Europe

<EOS>
They

lounge
along
in
loose
great

equally
mean

cumbersome

betray
manifest
mark
of
dejection
  
<EOS>
certain

the

could
not

take
a

We

princely
sport

<EOS>
these
be
the
lonely
hill
of
Morven

where
Fingal
and
his

enjoy
the

pastime

I
feel
an
enthusiastic
pleasure
when
I
survey
the
brown
heath
that
Ossian

and
hear
the
wind
whistle
through

<EOS>
when
I
enter
our

I
look

the
suspended
harp
of
that
divine
bard

and
listen
in
hope
of
hear

the
Poems

at

we
dine
a

day
ago
,
can
repeat
them
all
in
the
original
Gaelick

which
have
a
great
affinity
to
the
Welch
,
not
only
in
the
general
sound
,
but
also
in
a
great
number
of
adical
word
;
and
I
make
no
doubt
but
that
they
be
both
spring
from
the
same
origin
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
a
little
surprised
,
when
ask
a
Highlander
one
day
,
if
he
know
where
we
should
find
any
game
?
<EOS>
he
reply
,
"
bu

Sassenagh

"
which
signify
no
English

<EOS>
the
very
same
answer
I
should
have
receive
from
a
Welchman
,
and
almost
in
the
same
word
.
<EOS>
the
Highlanders
have
no
other
name
for
the
people
of
the
low
-
country
,
but
Sassenagh
,
or
saxon
;
a
strong
presumption
,
that
the
Lowland
Scots
and
the
English
be
derive
from
the
same
stock
  
<EOS>
the
peasant
of
these
hill
strongly
resemble
those
of
Wales
in
their
look
,
their
manner
,
and
habitation
;
every
thing
I
see

hear
,
and
feel
,
seem
Welch
  
<EOS>
the
mountain
,
vale

and
stream
;
the
air

climate

the
beef

mutton

be
all
Welch
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
own
,
however
,
that
this
people
be
better
provide
than
we
in
some
article
  
<EOS>
They
have
plenty
of
red
deer
and
roebuck
,
which
be
fat

delicious
at
this
season
of
the
year
  
Their
sea
teem
with
amazing
quantity
of
the
fine
fish

very
good

Our

a
cadet

the
family

Argyle

hereditary
captain
of
one
of
his
castle
  
<EOS>
His
name
,
in
plain
English

be
Dougal
Campbell
;
but
as
there
be
a
great
number
of
the
same
appellation
,
they
be
distinguished
(
like
the
Welch
)
by
patronimic
;

as
I
have
know
an
ancient
Briton
call
Madoc
ap

Morgan

our

He
have
travel
in
the
course

his

and
be
dispose
to
make
certain
alteration
in
his
domestic
oeconomy
;
but
he
find
it
impossible
to
abolish
the
ancient
custom
of
the
family
;
some
of
which
be
ludicrous
enough
  
<EOS>
His
piper
,
for
example
,
who
be
an
hereditary
officer
of
the
household
,
will
not
part
with
the
least
particle
of
his
privilege
  
<EOS>
He
have
a
right
to
wear
the
kilt

ancient
Highland
dress

with
the
purse

pistol

and
durk
 
a

be
throw
over
his
shoulder

and
trail
along
the
ground
,
while
he
perform
the
function
of
his
minstrelsy
;
and
this
,
I
suppose
,
be
analogous
to
the
pennon
or
flag
which
be
formerly
carry
before
every
knight
in
battle

He
play
before
the
laird
every
Sunday
in
his
way
to
the
kirk

which
he
circle
three
time
,
perform
the
family
march
,
which
imply
defiance
to
all
the
enemy
of
the
clan

and
every
morning
he
play
a
full
hour
by
the
clock
,
in
the
great

march
backwards
and
forwards
all
the
time
,
with
a
solemn
pace

attend
by
the
laird

kinsman
,
who
seem
much
delighted
with
the
music
  
<EOS>
in
this
exercise

he
indulge
them
with
a
variety
of
pibrachs

suit
to
the
different
passion
,
which
he
would
either
excite

assuage

an
invincible
antipathy
to
the
sound
of
the
Highland
bag
-
pipe
,
which
sing
in
the
nose
with
a
most
alarming
twang
,
and
,
indeed
,
be
quite
intolerable
to
ear
of
common
sensibility
,
when
aggravate
by
the
echo
of
a
vaulted
hall
  
<EOS>
He
therefore
beg
the
piper
would
have
some
mercy
upon
him
,
and
dispense
with
this
part
of
the
morning
service
  
<EOS>
a
consultation
of
the
clan
be
hold
on
this
occasion
,
it
be
unanimously
agree
,
that
the
laird
's
request
could
not
be
grant
without
a
dangerous
encroachment
upon
the
custom
of
the
family
  
<EOS>
the
piper
declare
,
he
could
not
give
up
for
a
moment
the
privilege
he
derive
from
his
ancestor
;
nor
would
the
laird
's
relation
forego
an
entertainment
which
they
value
above
all
other
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
remedy
;
Mr
Campbell
,
be
oblige
to
acquiesce
,
be
fain
to
stop
his
ear
with
cotton
;
to
fortify
his
head
with
three
or
four
night
-
cap
,
and
every
morning
retire
into
the
penetralia
of
his
habitation
,
in
order
to
avoid
this
diurnal
annoyance
.
<EOS>
when
the
music
cease
,
he
produce
himself
at
an
open
window
that
look
into
the
court
-
yard
,
which
be
by
this
time
fill
with
a
crowd
of
his
vassal
and
dependent
,
who
worship
his
first
appearance
,
by
uncover
their
head
,
and
bow
to
the
earth
with
the
most
humble
prostration
.
<EOS>
as
all
these
people
have
something
to
communicate
in
the
way
of
proposal
,
complaint
,
or
petition
,
they
wait
patiently
till
the
laird
come
forth
,
and
,
follow
him
in
his
walk
,
be
favour
each
with
a
short
audience
in
his
turn
.
<EOS>
two
day
ago
,
he
dispatch
above
an
hundred
different
solicitor
,
in
walk
with
us
to
the
house
of
a
neighbour
gentleman
,
where
we
dine
by
invitation
.
<EOS>
Our
landlord
's
house
-
keeping
be
equally
rough
and
hospitable
,
and
favour
much
of
simplicity
of
ancient
time
:
the
great
hall
,
pave
with
flat
stone
,
be
about
forty
-
five
foot
by
twenty
-
two
,
and
serve
not
only
for
a
dining
-
room
,
but
also
for
a
bed
-
chamber
to
gentleman
-
dependent
and
hanger
-
on
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
at
night
,
half
a
dozen
occasional
bed
be
range
on
each
side
along
the
wall
.
<EOS>
these
be
make
of
fresh
heath
,
pull
up
by
the
root
,
and
dispose
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
a
very
agreeable
couch
,
where
they
lie
,
without
any
other
covering
than
the
plaid
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
and
I
be
indulge
with
separate
chamber
and
down
bed
,
which
we
beg
to
exchange
for
a
layer
of
heath
;
and
indeed
I
never
sleep
so
much
to
my
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
only
soft
and
elastic
,
but
the
plant
,
be
in
flower
,
diffuse
an
agreeable
fragrance
which
be
wonderfully
refreshing
and
restorative

<EOS>
yesterday
we
be
invite
to
the
funeral
of
an
old
lady
,
the
grand
-
mother
of
a
gentleman
in
this
neighbourhood
,
and
find
ourselves
in
the
midst
of
fifty
people
,
who
be
regale
with
a
sumptuous
feast
,
accompany
by
the
music
of
a
dozen
piper
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
this
meeting
have
all
the
air
of
a
grand
festival
;
and
the
guest
do
such
honour
to
the
entertainment
,
that
many
of
them
could
not
stand
when
we
be
remind
of
the
business
on
which
we
have
meet
.
<EOS>
the
company
forthwith
take
horse
,
ride
in
a
very
irregular
cavalcade
to
the
place
of
interment
,
a
church
,
at
the
distance
of
two
long
mile
from
the
castle
.
<EOS>
on
our
arrival
,
however
,
we
find
we
have
commit
a
small
oversight
,
in
leave
the
corpse
behind
;
so
that
we
be
oblige
to
wheel
about
,
and
meet
the
old
gentlewoman
half
way
,
carry
upon
pole
by
the
near
relation
of
her
family
,
and
attend
by
the
coronach
,
compose
of
a
multitude
of
old
hag
,
who
tear
their
hair
,
beat
their
breast
,
and
howl
most
hideously
.
<EOS>
at
the
grave
,
the
orator
,
or
 
senachie
,
pronounce
the
panegyric
of
the
defunct
,
every
period
be
confirm
by
a
yell
of
the
coronach
.
<EOS>
the
body
be
commit
to
the
earth
,
the
piper
play
a
pibroch
all
the
time
;
and
all
the
company
stand
uncover
.
<EOS>
the
ceremony
be
close
with
the
discharge
of
pistol
;
then
we
return
to
the
castle
,
resume
the
bottle
,
and
by
midnight
there
be
not
a
sober
person
in
the
family
,
the
female
exepte
.
<EOS>
the
squire
and
I
be
,
with
some
difficulty
,
permit
to
retire
with
our
landlord
in
the
evening
;
but
our
intertainer
be
a
little
chagrined
at
our
retreat
;
and
afterwards
seem
to
think
it
a
disparagement
to
his
family
,
that
not
above
a
hundred
gallon
of
whiskey
have
be
drink
upon
such
a
solemn
occasion
.
<EOS>
this
morning
we
get
up
by
four
,
to
hunt
the
roebuck
,
and
,
in
half
an
hour
,
find
breakfast
ready
serve
in

<EOS>
the

but
we
be

by
an
infinite

of
Gaellys

or
ragged
Highlanders

without

.
    
<EOS>
the
follow
article
form
our

repast
:
one
kit

a

an

and
a

<EOS>
there
be
a
ladle
chain
to
the
cream

,
with
curious
wooden
bicker
to
be

from
this
reservoir
.
<EOS>
the
spirit
be
drink
out
of
a
silver
quaff
,
and
the
ale
out
of
horn
:
<EOS>
great
justice
be
do
to
the
collation
by
the
guest
in
general
;
one
of
them
in
particular
eat
above
two
dozen
of
hard
egg
,
with
a
proportionable
quantity
of
bread
,
butter
,
and
honey

nor
be
one

<EOS>
finally
,
a
large
roll
of
tobacco
be
present
by
way
of
desart
,
and
every
individual
take
a
comfortable
quid
to
prevent
,
the
bad
effect
of
the
morning
air
.
<EOS>
We
have
a
fine
chase
over
the
mountain
,
after
a
roebuck
,
which
we
kill
,
and
I
get
home
time
enough
to
drink
tea
with
Mrs
Campbell
and
our
"
squire
.
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
we
shall
set
out
on
our
return
for
Cameron
.
<EOS>
We
propose
to
cross
the
Firth
of
Clyde
,
and
take
the
town
of
Greenock
and
Port
-
Glasgow
in
our
way
.
<EOS>
this
circuit
be
finish
,
we
shall
turn
our
face
to
the
south
,
and
follow
the
sun
with
augment
velocity
,
in
order
to
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
autumn
in
England
,
where
Boreas
be
not
quite
so
biting
as
he
begin
already
to
be
on

<EOS>
to
Dr
Lewis
.
  
<EOS>
dear
DICK
,
about
a
fornight
be
now
elapse
since
we
leave
the
capital
of
Scotland
,
direct
our
course
towards
Stirling
,
where
we
lay
  
<EOS>
the
castle
of
this
place
be
such
another
as
that
of
Edinburgh
,
and
afford
a
surprising
prospect
of
the
winding
of
the
river
Forth
,
which
be
so
extraordinary
,
that
the
distance
from
hence
to
Alloa
,
by
land
,
be
but
four
mile
,
and
by
water
it
be
twenty
-
four
.
<EOS>
Alloa
be
a
neat
thriving
town
,
that
depend
in
a
great
measure
on
the
commerce
of
Glasgow
,
the
merchant
of
which
send
hither
tobacco
and
other
article
,
to
be
deposit
in
warehouse
for
exportation
from
the
Frith
of
Forth
.
<EOS>
in
our
way
hither
we
visit
a
flourish
iron
-
work
,
where
,
instead
of
burn
wood
,
they
use
coal
,
which
they
have
the
art
of
clear
in
such
a
manner
as
free
it
from
the
sulphur
,
that
would
otherwise
,
render
the
metal
too
brittle
for
work
.
<EOS>
excellent
coal
be
find
in
almost
every
part
of
Scotland
.
    
<EOS>
the
soil
of
this
district
produce
scarce
any
other
grain
but
oats
and
barley
;
perhaps
because
it
be
poorly
cultivate
,
and
almost
altogether
uninclosed
.
<EOS>
the
few
inclosure
they
have
consist
of
paultry
wall
of
loose
stone
gather
from
the
field
,
which
indeed
they
cover
,
as
if
they
have
be
scatter
on
purpose
.
<EOS>
when
I
express
my
surprize
that
the
peasant
do
not
discumber
their
ground
of
these
stone
;
a
gentleman
,
well
acquaint
with
the
theory
as
well
as
practice
of
farming
,
assure
me
that
the
stone
,
far
from
be
prejudicial
,
be
serviceable
to
the
crop
.
<EOS>
this
philosoper
have
order
a
field
of
his
own
to
be
clear
,
manure
and
sow
with
barley
,
and
the
produce
be
more
scanty
than
before
.
<EOS>
He
cause
the
stone
to
be
replace
,
and
next
year
the
crop
be
as
good
as
ever
.
<EOS>
the
stone
be
remove
a
second
time
,
and
the
harvest
fail
;
they
be
again
bring
back
,
and
the
ground
retrieve
its
fertility
.
<EOS>
the
same
experiment
have
be
try
in
different
part
of
Scotland
with
the
same
success
  
astonish
at
this
information
,
I
desire
to
know
in
what
manner
he
account
for
this
strange
phenomenon
;
and
he
say
there
be
three
way
in
which
the
ston
may
be
serviceable
.
<EOS>
They
may
possibly
restrain
an
excess
in
the
perspiration
of
the
earth
,
analogous
to
colliquative
sweat
,
by
which
the
human
body
be
sometimes
waste
and
consume
.
<EOS>
They
may
act
as
so
many
sence
to
protect
the
tender
blade
from
the
pierce
wind
of
the
spring
;
or
,
by
multiply
the
reflexion
of
the
sun
,
they
may
increase
the
warmth
so
as
to
mitigate
the
natural
chilness
of
the
soil
and
climate
  
<EOS>
but
,
surely
,
this
excessive
perspiration
may
be
more
effectually
check
by
different
kind
of
manure
,
such
as
ashe
,
lime
,
chalk
,
or
marl
,
of
which
last
<EOS>
it
seem
there
be
many
pit
in
this
kingdom
:
<EOS>
as
for
the
warmth
,
it
would
be
much
more
;
equally
obtain
by
inclosure
;
one
half
of
the
ground
which
be
now
cover
,
would
be
retrieve
;
the
cultivation
would
require
less
labour
;
and
the
ploughs
,
harrow
,
and
horse
,
would
not
suffer
half
the
damage
which
they
now
sustain
.
    
<EOS>
these
north
-
western
part
be
by
no
mean
fertile
in
corn
.
<EOS>
the
ground
be
naturally
barren
and
moorish
.
<EOS>
the
peasant
be
poorly
lodge
,
meagre
in
their
look
,
mean
in
their
apparel
,
and
remarkably
dirty
.
<EOS>
this
last
reproach
they
may
easily
wash
off
by
mean
of
those
lake
,
river
,
and
rivulet
of
pure
water
,
with
which
they
be
so
liberally
supply
by
nature
.
<EOS>
agriculture
can
not
be
expect
to
flourish
where
the
farm
be
small
,
the
lease
short
,
and
the
husbandman
begin
upon
a
rack
rent
,
without
a
sufficient
stock
to
answer
the
purpose
of
improvement
.
<EOS>
the
granary
of
Scotland
be
the
bank
of
the
Tweed
,
the
county
of
East
and
Mid
-
Lothian
,
the
Carse
of
Gowrie
,
in
Perthshire
,
equal
in
fertility
to
any
part
of
England
,
and
some
tract
in
Aberdeenshire
and
Murray
,
where
I
be
tell
the
harvest
be
more
early
than
in
Northumberland
,
although
they
lie
above
two
degree
farther
north
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
strong
curiosity
to
visit
many
place
beyond
the
forth
and
the
Tay
,
such
as
Perth
,
Dundee
,
Montrose
,
and
Aberdeen
,
which
be
town
equally
elegant
and
thriving
;
but
the
season
be
too
far
advanced
,
to
admit
of
this
addition
to
my
original
plan
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
so
far
happy
as
to
have
see
Glasgow
,
which
,
to
the
good
of
my
recollection
and
judgment
,
be
one
of
the
pretty
town
in
Europe
;
and
,
without
all
doubt
,
it
be
one
of
the
most
flourishing
in
Great
Britain
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
it
be
a
perfect
bee
-
hive
in
point
of
industry
.
<EOS>
It
stand
partly
on
a
gentle
declivity
;
but
the
great
part
of
it
be
in
a
plain
,
water
by
the
river
Clyde
.
<EOS>
the
street
be
straight
,
open
,
airy
,
and
well
pave
;
and
the
house
lofty
and
well
build
of
hewn
stone
.
<EOS>
at
the
upper
end
of
the
town
,
there
be
venerable
cathedral
,
that
may
be
compare
with
York
-
minster
or
Westminster
;
and
,
about
the
middle
of
the
descent
from
this
to
the
Cross
,
be
the
college
,
a
respectable
pile
of
building
,
with
all
manner
of
accommodation
for
the
professor
and
student
,
include
an
elegant
library
,
and
an
observatory
well
provide
with
astronomical
instrument
.
<EOS>
the
number
of
inhabitant
be
say
to
amount
to
thirty
thousand
;
and
mark
of
opulence
and
independency
appear
in
every
quarter
of
this
commercial
city
,
which
,
however
,
be
not
without
its
inconvenience
and
detect
:
the
water
of
their
public
pump
be
generally
hard
and
brackish
,
an
imperfection
the
less
excusable
,
as
the
river
Clyde
run
by
their
door
,
in
the
low
part
of
the
town
,
and
there
be
rivulet
and
spring
above
the
cathedral
,
sufficient
to
fill
a
large
reservoir
with
excellent
water
,
which
may
be
thence
distribute
to
all
the
different
part
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
more
consequence
to
consult
the
health
of
the
inhabitant
in
this
article
,
than
to
employ
so
much
attention
in
beautify
their
town
with
new
street
,
square
,
and
church
.
<EOS>
another
defect
,
not
so
easily
remedie
,
be
the
shallowness
of
the
river
,
which
will
not
float
vessel
of
any
burden
within
ten
or
twelve
mile
of
the
city
;
so
that
the
merchant

<EOS>
here
I

Mr

who
may
be

one
of
the
sage
of
this
kingdom
.
<EOS>
He

<EOS>

occasion
Mr

<EOS>
I

Dr
John

a
patriot
of
a
truly
roman
spirit
,
who
be
the
father
of

<EOS>
I
moreover
converse
with
one
Mr
G####ssf####d
,
whom
I
take
to
be
one
of
the
great
merchant
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
in
the
last

he
be
say
to
have
have
at
one

five

twenty

with
their

,
his
own
property
,
and
to
have
trade
for
above
half
a

.
<EOS>
the
last
war
be
a
fortunate
period
for
the
commerce
of
Glasgow
  
<EOS>
the
merchant
,
consider
that
their

bind

America
,
launch
out
at
once
into
the
Atlantic
by
the
north
of
Ireland
,
pursue
a

very
little
frequent
by

resolve
to
insure
one
another

save
a
very
considerable
sum
by
this
resolution
,
as
few
or
none
of
their

be

<EOS>
You
must
know
I
have
a
sort
of
national
attachment
to
this
part
of
Scotland
  
<EOS>
the
great
church
dedicate
to
St.
Mongah
,
the
river
Clyde
,
and
other
particular
that
smack
of
our
Welch
language
and
custom
,
contribute
to
flatter
me
with
the
notion
,
that
these
people
be
the
descendant
of
the
Britons
,
who
once
possess
this
country
.
<EOS>
without
all
question
,
this
be
a
cumbrian
kingdom
:
<EOS>
its
capital
be
Dumbarton
(
a
corruption
of
Dunbritton
)
which
still
exist
as
a
royal
borough
,
at
the
influx
of
the
Clyde
and
Leven
,
ten
mile
below
Glasgow
.
<EOS>
the
same
neighbourhood
give
birth
to
St.
Patrick
,
the
apostle
of
Ireland
,
at
a
place
where
there
be
still
a
church
and
village
,
which
retain
his
name
.
<EOS>
hard
by
be
some
vestige
of
the
famous
roman
wall
,
build
in
the
reign
of
Antonine
,
from
the
Clyde
to
the
Forth
,
and
fortify
with
castle
,
to
restrain
the
incursion
of
the
Scots
or
Caledonians
,
who
inhabit
the
west
-
Highlands
.
<EOS>
in
a
line
parallel
to
this
wall
,
the
merchant
of
Gsasgow
have
determine
to
make
a
navigable
canal
betwixt
the
two
Friths
,
which
will
be
of
incredible
advantage
to
their
commerce
,
in
transport
merchandize
from
one
side
of
the
island
to
the
other
.
    
<EOS>
from
Glasgow
we
travel
along
the
Clyde
,
which
be
a
delightful
stream
,
adorn
on
both
side
with
villas
,
town
,
and
,
village

<EOS>
here
be
no
want
of
grove
,
and
meadow
,
and
corn

field
intersperse
;
but
on
this
side
of
Glasgow
,
there
be
little
other
grain
than
oats
and
barley
;
the
first
be
much
well
,
the
last
much
bad
,
than
those
of
the
same
specie
in
England
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
there
be
so
little
rye
,
which
be
a
grain
that
will
thrive
in
almost
any
soil
,
and
it
be
still
more
surprising
,
that
the
cultivation
of
potato
should
be
so
much
neglect
in
the
Highlands
,
where
the
poor
people
have
not
meal
enough
to
supply
them
with
bread
through
the
winter
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
side
of
the

Paisley

<EOS>
the

curiosity

from

as
well

from
the
nature
of
its

<EOS>
We
now
cross
the
water
of
Leven
,
which
,
though
nothing
near
so
considerable
as
the
Clyde

be
much
more
transparent

pastoral

delightful

,
upon

I
prefer

a
preference
which
be
certainly
owe
to
the
verdant

DEAR
DOCTOR
,
if
I
be
dispose
to
be
critical
,
I
should
say
this
house
of
Cameron
be
too
near
the
lake
,
which
approach
,
on
one
side
,
to
within
six
or
seven
yard
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
place
in
a
high
site
,
which
would
have
afford
a
more
extensive
prospect
and
a
drier
atmosphere
;
but
this
imperfection
be
not
chargeable
on
the
present
proprietor
,
who
purchase
it
ready
build
,
rather
than
be
at
the
trouble
of
repair
his
own
family
-
house
of
Bonhill
,
which
stand
two
mile
from
hence
on
the
Leven
,
so
surround
with
plantation
,
that
it
use
to
be
know
by
the
name
of
the
Mavis

or
thrush
)
<EOS>
Nest
.
<EOS>
above
that
house
be
a
romantic
glen
or
clift
of
a
mountain
,
cover
with
hang
wood
have
at
bottom
a
stream
of
fine
water
that
form
a
number
of
cascade
in
its
descent
to
join
the
Leven
,
so
that
the
scene
be
quite
enchanting
.

"

<EOS>
indeed
,
this

would
be
a
perfect
paradise
,
if
it
be
not
,
like
Wales
,
curse
with
a
weeeping
climate
,
owe
to
the

cause
in
both
,
the
neighbourhood
of
high
mountain
,
and
a

situation
,
expose
to
the
vapour

the
Atlantic
ocean

<EOS>
this
air
,
however
,
notwithstanding
its
humidity

be
so
healthy

that
the

scarce
ever
visit
by
any
other
disease
than
the
small

certain
cutaneous
evil

be
the
effect

dirty
living

the

reproach

<EOS>
here
be
a

many
living
monument

longaevity

among
the
rest
a

I
treat

singular
respect

as
a
venerable
druid

who
have
live
near
ninety
year
,
without
pain
or
sickness
,
among
oak
of
his
own
planting

<EOS>
He
be
once
proprietor
of
these
land
:
but
be
of
a
project
spirit
,
some
of
his
scheme
miscarry
,
and
he
be
oblige
to
part
with
his
possession
,
which
hath
shift
hand
two
or
three
time
since
that
period
;
but
every
succeed
proprietor
hath
do
every
thing
in
his
power
,
to
make
his
old
age
easy
and
comfortable
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
sufficiency
to
procure
the
necessary
of
life
;
and
he
and
his
old
woman
reside
in
a
small
convenient
farm
-
house
,
have
a
little
garden
which
he
cultivate
with
his
own

<EOS>
this
ancient

live

great
health

peace

harmony

and
,
know
no
want
,
enjoy
the
perfection
of
content
.
<EOS>
Mr
Smollett
call
him
the
admiral
,
because
he
insist
upon
steer
his
pleasure
-
boat
upon
the
lake
;
and
he
spend
most
of
his
time
in
range
through
the
wood
,
which
he
declare
he
enjoy
as
much
as
if
they
be
still
his
own
property
  
<EOS>
I
ask
him
the
other
day
,
if
he
be
never
sick
,
and
he
answer
,
yes
;
he
have
a
slight
fever
the
year
before
the
union
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
not
deaf
,
I
should
take
much
pleasure
in
his
conversation
;
for
he
be
very
intelligent
and
his
memory
be
surprisingly
retensive
  
<EOS>
these
be
the
happy
effect
of
temperance
,
exercise
,
and
good
nature
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
his
innocence

however

he

<EOS>
on

Humphry

the

<EOS>
through

he

run
into

with
his
hair
stand
on

stare
wildly

He

<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
in
my
last

I
have
project
an
excursion
to
the
Highlands
,
which
project
I
have
now
happily
execute
,
under
the
auspex
of
Sir
George
Colquhoun
,
a
colonel
in
the
dutch
service
,
who
offer
himself
as
our
conductor
on
this
occasion
.

to
the

,
we
set
out
on
horseback
for
Inverary
,
the
county
town
of
Argyle
,
and
dine
on
the
road
with
the
Laird
of
Macfarlane
,
the
great
genealogist
I
ever
know
in
any
country
,
and
perfectly
acquaint
with
all
the
antiquity
of
Scotland
.
    
<EOS>
the
duke
of
Argyle
have
an
old
castle
at
Inverary
,
where
he
reside
when
he
be
in
Scotland
;
and
hard
by
be
the
shell
of
a
noble
gothic
palace
,
build
by
the
last
duke
,
which
,
when
finish
,
will
be
a
great
ornament
to
this
part
of
the
Highlands
.
<EOS>
as
for
Inverary
,
it
be
a
place
of
very
little
importance
.
<EOS>
this
country
be
amazingly
wild
,
especially
towards
the
mountain
,
which
be
heap
upon
the
back
of
one
another
,
make
a
most
stupendous
appearance
of
savage
nature
,
with
hardly
any
sign
of
cultivation
,
or
even
of
population
.
<EOS>
all
be
sublimity
,
silence
and
solitude
.
<EOS>
the
people
live
together
in
glen
or
bottom
,
where
they
be
shelter
from
the
cold
and
storm
of
winter
:
but
there
be
a
margin
of
plain
ground
spread
along
the
sea
side
,
which
be
well
inhabit
and
improve
by
the
art
of
husbandry
;
and
this
I
take
to
be
one
of
the
most
agreeable
tract
of
the
whole
island
;
the
sea
not
only
keep
it
warm
,
and
suplie
it
with
fish
,
but
afford
one
of
the
most
ravish
prospect
in
the
whole
world
;
I
mean
the
appearance
of
the
Hebrides
,
or
Western
Islands
,
to
the
number
of
three
hundred
,
scatter
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
,
in
the
most
agreeable
confusion
.
<EOS>
as
the
soil
and
climate
of
the
Highlands
be
but
ill
adapt
to
the
cultivation
of
corn
,
the
people
apply
themselves
chiefly
to
the
breeding
and
feeding
of
black
cattle
,
which
turn
to
good
account
,
those
animal
run
wild
all
the
winter
,
without
any
shelter
or
subsistance
,
but
what
they
can
find
among
the
heath
.
<EOS>
when
the
snow
lie
so
deep
and
hard
,
that
they
can
not
penetrate
to
the
root
of
the
grass
,
they
make
a
diurnal
progress
,
guide
by
a
sure
instinct
,
to
the
sea
-
side
at
low
water
,
where
they
feed
on
the
alga
marina
,
and
other
plant
that
grow
upon
the
beach
.
    
<EOS>
perhaps
this
branch
of
husbandry
,
which
require
very
little
attendance
and
labour
,
be
one
of
the
principal
cause
of
that
idleness
and
want
of
industry
,
which
distinguish
these
mountaineer
in
their
own
country
  
when
they
come
forth
into
the
world
they
become
a
diligent
and
alert
as
any
people
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
They
be
undoubtedly
a
very
distinct
-
specie
from
their
fellow
-
subject
of
the
Lowlands
,
against
whom
they
indulge
an
ancient
spirit
of
animosity
;
and
this
difference
be
very
discernible
even
among
person
of
family
and
education
.
<EOS>
the
Lowlanders
be
generally
cool
and
circumspect
,
the
Highlanders
fiery
and
ferocious
:
but
this
violence
of
their
passion
serve
only
to
inflame
the
zeal
of
their
devotion
to
stranger
,
which
be
truly
enthusiastic
.
    
<EOS>
We
proceed
about
twenty
mile
beyond
Inverary
,
to
the
house
of
a
gentleman
,
a
friend
of
our
conductor
,
where
we
stay
a
few
day
,
and
be
feast
in
such
a
manner
,
that
I
begin
to
dread
the
consequence
to
my
constitution
.
    
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
solitude
that
prevail
among
these
mountain
,
there
be
no
want
of
people
in
the
Highlands
,
I
be
credibly
inform
that
the
duke
of
Argyle
can
assemble
five
thousand
man
in
arm
,
of
his
own
clan
and
surname
,
which
be
Campbell
;
and
there
be
besides
a
tribe
of
the
same
appellation
,
whose
chief
be
the
Earl
of
Breadalbine
.
<EOS>
the
Macdonalds
be
as
numerous
,
and
remarkably
warlike
:
<EOS>
the
Camerons
,
M'Leods
,
Frasers
,
Grants
,
M'Kenzies
,
M'Kays
,
M'Phersons
,
M'Intoshes
,
be
powerful
clan
;
so
that
if
all
the
Highlanders
,
include
the
inhabitant
of
the
Isles
,
be
unite
,
they
could
bring
into
the
field
an
army
of
forty
thousand
fight
man
,
capable
of
undertake
the
most
dangerous
enterprize
.
<EOS>
We
have
live
to
see
four
thousand
of
them
,
without
discipline
,
throw
the
whole
kingdom
of
Great
Britain
into
confusion
.
<EOS>
They
attack
and
defeat
two
army
of
regular
troop
,
accustom
to
service
.
<EOS>
They
penetrate
into
the
centre
of
England
;
and
afterwards
march
back
with
deliberation
,
in
the
face
of
two
other
army
,
through
an
enemy
's
country
,
where
every
precaution
be
take
to
cut
off
their
retreat
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
any
other
people
in
Europe
,
who
,
without
the
use
or
knowledge
of
arm
,
will
attack
regular
force
sword
in
hand
,
if
their
chief
will
head
them
in
battle
.
<EOS>
when
discipline
,
they
can
not
fail
of
be
excellent
soldier
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
walk
like
the
generality
of
mankind
,
but
trot
and
bounce
like
deer
,
as
if
they
move
upon
spring
.
<EOS>
They
greatly
excel
the
Lowlanders
in
all
the
exercise
that
require
agility
;
the
be
incredibly
abstemious
,
and
patient
of
hunger
and
fatigue
;
so
steel
against
the
weather
,
that
in
travel
,
even
when
the
ground
be
cover
with
snow
,
they
never
look
for
a
house
,
or
any
other
shelter
but
their
plaid
,
in
which
they
wrap
themselves
up
,
and
go
to
sleep
under
the
cope
of
heaven
.
<EOS>
such
people
,
in
quality
of
soldier
,
must
be
invincible
,
when
the
business
be
to
perform
quick
marche
in
a
difficult
country
,
to
strike
sudden
stroke
,
beat
up
the
enemy
's
quarter
,
harass
their
cavalry
,
and
perform
expedition
without
the
formality
of
magazine
,
baggage
,
forage
,
and
artillery
.
<EOS>
the
chieftainship
of
the
Higlanders
be
a
very
dangerous
influence
operate
at
the
extremity
of
the
island
,
where
the
eye
and
hand
of
government
can
not
be
suppose
to
see
and
act
with
precision
and
vigour
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
break
the
force
of
clanship
,
administration
have
always
practise
the
political
maxim
,
Divide
et
impera
.
<EOS>
the
legislature
hath
not
only
disarm
these
mountaineer
,
but
also
deprive
them
of
their
ancient
garb
,
which
contribute
in
a
great
measure
to
keep
up
their
military
spirit
;
and
their
slavish
tenure
be
dissolve
by
act
of
parliament
;
so
that
they
be
at
present
as
free
and
independent
of
their
chief
,
as
the
law
can
make
them
:
but
the
original
attachment
still
remain
,
and
be
found
on
something
prior
to
the
feudal
system
,
about
which
the
writer
of
this
age
have
make
such
a
pother
,
as
if
it
be
a
new
discovery
,
like
the
copernican
system
.
<EOS>
:
every
peculiarity
of
policy
,
custom
,
and
even
temperament
,
be
affectedly
trace
to
this
origin
,
as
if
the
feudal
constitution
have
not
be
common
to
almost
all
the
native
of
Europe
.
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
expect
to
see
the
use
of
trunk
-
hose
and
butter
ale
ascribe
to
the
influence
of
the
feudal
system
.
<EOS>
the
connection
between
the
clan
and
their
chief
be
,
without
all
doubt
,
patriarchal
.
<EOS>
It
be
found
on
hereditary
regard
and
affection
,
cherish
through
a
long
succession
of
age
.
<EOS>
the
clan
consider
the
chief
as
their
father
,
they
bear
his
name
,
they
believe
themselves
descend
from
his
family
,
and
they
obey
him
as
their
lord
,
with
all
the
ardour
of
filial
love
and
veneration
;
while
he
,
on
his
part
,
exert
a
paternal
authority
,
commanding
,
chastise
,
rewarding
,
protect
,
and
maintain
them
as
his
own
child
.
<EOS>
if
the
legislature
would
entirely
destroy
this
connection
,
it
must
compel
the
Highlanders
to
change
their
habitation
and
their
name
.
<EOS>
even
this
experiment
have
be
formerly
try
without
success
  
<EOS>
in
the
reign
of
James
VI
a
battle
be
fight
within
a
few
short
mile
of
this
place
,
between
two
clan
,
the
M'Gregors
and
the
Colquhouns
,
in
which
the
latter
be
defeat
:
the
Laird
of
M'Gregor
make
such
a
barbarous
use
of
his
victory
,
that
he
be
forfeit
and
outlaw
by
act
of
parliament
:
his
land
be
give
to
the
family
of
Montrose
,
and
his
clan
be
oblige
to
change
their
name
.
<EOS>
the
obey
so
far
,
as
to
call
themselves
severally
Campbell
,
Graham
,
or
Drummond
,
the
surname
of
the
family
of
Argyle
,
Montrose
,
and
Perth
,
that
they
may
enjoy
the
protection
of
those
house
;
but
they
still
add
M'Gregor
to
their
new
appellation
;
and
as
their
chief
be
deprive
of
his
estate
,
they
rob
and
plunder
for
his
subsistence
.

Mr

in

act

,
pass
at
the
beginning
of
the
late
war
,
pay
a
visit
to
his

and
hire
a
farm
in
the
neighbourhood
of
his
father
's
house

<EOS>
the

him
from

stock
his
farm
with
seven
hundred
black
cattle

which
they
have
save
in
the
general
wreck
of
their
affair

but
their
beloved
chief
,
who
be
a
promising
youth
,
do
not
live
to
enjoy
the
fruit
of
their
fidelity
and
attachment
.
    
<EOS>
the
most
effectual
method
<EOS>
I
know
to
weaken
,
and
at
length
destroy
this
influence
,
be
to
employ
the
commonalty
in
such
a
manner
to
give
them
a
taste
of
property
and
independence
  
<EOS>
in
vain
the
government
grant
them
advantageous
lease
on
the
forfeit
estate
,
if
they
have
no
property
to
prosecute
the

<EOS>
the

can
not

salt

line

net

and
other

<EOS>
I
converse
with
a
sensible
man
of
this
country
,
who
,
from
a
real
spirit
of
patriotism
,
have
set
up
a
fishery
on
the
coast
,
and
a
manufacture
of
coarse
linen
,
for
the
employment
of
the
poor
Highlanders
.
<EOS>
Cod
be
here
in
such
plenty
,
that
he
tell
me
he
have
see
seven
hundred
take
on
one
line
,
at
one
hawl
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
observe
,
however
,
that
the
line
be
of
immense
length
,
and
have
two
thousand
hook
,
bait
with
muscle
;
but
the
fish
be
so
superior
to
the
cod
catch
on
the
bank
of
Newfoundland
,
that
his
corespondent
at
Lisbon
sell
them
immediately
at
his
own
price
,
although
Lent
be
just
over
when
they
arrive
,
and
the
people
may
be
suppose
quite
cloy
with
this
kind
of
diet
  
<EOS>
His
linen
manufacture
be
likewise
in
a
prosperous
way
,
when
the
late
war
intervene
,
all
his
good
hand
be
press
into
the
service
.
    
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
expect
,
that
the
gentleman
of
this
country
should
execute
commercial
scheme
to
render
their
vassal
independent
;
nor
,
indeed
,
be
such
scheme
suit
to
their
way
of
life
and
inclination
;
but
a
company
of
merchant
may

with
proper

,
turn
to
good
account
a

establish
in
this

Our

have
a
strange
itch
to
colonize
America

uncultivated
part

to
great
advantage

<EOS>
after
have
ramble
through
the
mountain

glen
of

we
visit
the
adjacent
island
of
Ila

Mull

<EOS>
in

where
Macdonald

We
have
be
six
week
in
Scotland
,
and
see
the
principal
town
of
the
kingdom
,
where
we
have
be
treat
with
great
civility
  
<EOS>
the
people
be
very
courteous
;
and
the
country
be
exceedingly
romantic
,
suit
my
turn
and
inclination
  
<EOS>
I
contract
some
friendship
at
Edinburgh
,
which
be
a
large
and
lofty
city
,
full
of
gay
company
;
and
,
in
particular
,
commence
an
intimate
correspondence
with
one
miss
R####t####n
,
an
amiable
young
lady
of
my
own
age
,
whose
charm
seem
to
soften
,
and
even
to
subdue
the
stubborn
heart
of
my
brother
Jery
;
but
he
no
sooner
leave
the
place
than
he
relapse
into
his
former
insensibility
  
<EOS>
I
feel
,
however
,
that
this
indifference
be
not
the
family
-
constitution
  
I
never
admit
but
one
idea
of
love
,
and
that
have
take
such
root
in
my
heart
,
as
to
be
equally
proof
against
all
the
pull
of
discretion
,
and
the
frest
of
neglect

<EOS>
Dear
Letty
!
<EOS>
I
have
an
alarming
adventure
at
the
hunter
ball
in
Edinburgh
  
<EOS>
while
I
sit
discourse
with
a
friend
in
a
corner
,
all
at
once
the
very
image
of
Wilson
stand
before
me
,
dress
exactly
as
he
be
in
the
character
of
Aimwell
!
<EOS>
It
be
one
Mr
Gordon
,
whom
I
have
not
see
before
  
shock
at
the
sudden
apparition
,
I
faint
away
,
and
throw
the
whole
assembly
in
confusion
  
<EOS>
however
,
the
cause
of
my
disorder
remain
a
secret
to
every
body
but
my
brother
,
who
be
likewise
strike
with
the
resemblance
,
and
scold
after
we
come
home
  
<EOS>
I
be
very
sensible
of
Jery
's
affection
,
and
know
he
speak
as
well
with
a
view
to
my
own
interest
and
happiness
,
as
in
regard
to
the
honour
of
the
family
;
but
I
can
not
bear
to
have
my
wound
probe
severely
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
so
much
affect
by
the
censure
he
pass
upon
my
own
indiscretion
,
as
with
the
reflection
he
make
on
the
conduct
of
Wilson
  
<EOS>
He
observe
,
that
if
he
be
really
the
gentleman
he
pretend
to
be
,
and
harbour
nothing
but
honourable
design
,
he
would
have
vindicate
his
pretension
in
the
face
of
day
  
<EOS>
this
remark
make
a
deep
impression
upon
my
mind
  
I
endeavour
to
conceal
my
thought
;
and
this
endeavour
have
a
bad
effect
upon
my
health
and
spirit
;
so
it
be
think
necessary
that
I
should
go
to
the
Highlands
,
and
drink
the
goat
-
milk
-
whey
.
    
<EOS>
We
go
accordingly
to
Lough
-
Lomond
,
one
of
the
most
enchanting
spot
in
the
whole
world
;
and
what
with
this
remedy
,
which
I
have
every
morning
fresh
from
the
mountain
,
and
the
pure
air
,
and
chearful
company
,
I
have
recover
my
flesh
and
appetite
;
though
there
be
something
still
at
bottom
,
which
it
be
not
in
the
power
of
air
,
exercise
,
company
,
or
medicine
to
remove
  
these
incident
would
not
touch
me
so
nearly
,
if
I
have
a
sensible
confidant
to
sympathize
with
my
affliction
,
and
comfort
me
with
wholesome
advice
  
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
of
this
kind
,
except
Win
.
<EOS>
Jenkins
,
who
be
really
a
good
body
in
the
main
,
but
very
ill
qualified
for
such
an
office
  
<EOS>
the
poor
creature
be
weak
in
her
nerve
,
as
well
as
in
her
understanding
;
otherwise
I
may
have
know
the
true
name
and
character
of
that
unfortunate
youth
  
<EOS>
but
why
do
I
call
him
unfortunate
?
<EOS>
perhaps
the
epithet
be
more
applicable
to
me
for
have
listen
to
the
false
profession
of
  
but
,
hold
!
<EOS>
I
have
as
yet
no
right
,
and
sure
I
have
no
inclination
to
believe
any
thing
to
the
prejudice
of
his
honour
  
<EOS>
in
that
reflection
I
shall
still
exert
my
patience
  
<EOS>
as
for
Mrs
Jenkins
,
she
herself
be
really
an
object
of
compassion
  
between
vanity
,
methodism
,
and
love
,
her
head
,
be
almost
turn
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
more
regard
for
her
however
,
if
she
have
be
more
constant
in
the
object
of
her
affection
;
but
,
truly
,
she
aim
at
conquest
,
and
flirt
at
the
same
time
with
my
uncle
's
footman
,
Humphry
Clinker
,
who
be
really
a
deserve
young
man
,
and
one
Dutton
,
my
brother
's
valet
de
chambre
,
a
debauch
fellow
;
who
,
leave
Win
.
<EOS>
in
the
lurch
,
run
away
with
another
man
's
bride
at
Berwick
.
    
<EOS>
My
dear
Willis
,
I
be
be
truly
ashamed
of
my
own
sex
  
<EOS>
We
complain
of
advantage
which
the
man
take
of
our
youth
,
inexperience
,
sensibility
,
and
all
that
;
but
I
have
see
enough
to
believe
,
that
our
sex
in
general
make
it
their
business
to
ensnare
the
other
;
and
for
this
purpose
,
employ
art
which
be
by
no
means
to
be
justify
  
<EOS>
in
point
of
constancy
,
they
certainly
have
nothing
to
reproach
the
male
part
of
the
creation
  
<EOS>
My
poor
aunt
,
without
any
regard
to
her
year
and
imperfection
,
have
go
to
market
with
her
charm
in
every
place
where
she
think
she
have
the
least
chance
to
dispose
of
her
person
,
which
,
however
,
hang
still
heavy
on
her
hand
  
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
she
have
use
even
religion
as
a
decoy
,
though
it
have
not
answer
her
expectation
  
<EOS>
She
have
be
pray
,
preach
,
and
catechising
among
the
methodist
,
with
whom
this
country
abound
;
and
pretend
to
have
such
manifestation
and
revelation
,
as
even
Clinker
himself
can
hardly
believe
,
though
the
poor
fellow
be
half
crazy
with
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
as
for
Jenkins
,
she
affect
to
take
all
her
mistress
's
reverie
for
gospel
  
<EOS>
She
have
also
her
heart
-
heaving
and
motion
of
the
spirit
;
and
God
forgive
me
if
I
think
uncharitably
,
but
all
this
seem
to
me
to
be
down
-
right
hypocrisy
and
deceit
  
<EOS>
perhaps
,
indeed
,
the
poor
girl
impose
on
herself
  
<EOS>
She
be
generally
in
a
flutter
,
and
be
much
subject
to
vapour
  
<EOS>
since
we
come
to
Scotland
,
she
have
see
apparition
,
and
pretend
to
prophesy
  
<EOS>
if
I
could
put
faith
in
all
these
supernatural
visitation
,
I
should
think
myself
abandon
of
grace
;
for
I
have
neither
see
,
hear
,
nor
feel
any
thing
of
this
nature
,
although
I
endeavour
to
discharge
the
duty
of
religion
with
all
the
sincerity
,
zeal
,
and
devotion
,
that
be
in
the
power
of

I
have
be
on

world
since
I
send

my
last
letter

<EOS>
We
go
by
sea
to
another
kingdom
call
Fife
,
and
come
back
,
have
like
to
have
go
to
pot
in
a
storm
.
  
<EOS>
what
between
the
frite
and
sickness
,
I
think
I
should
have
bring
my
heart
up
;
even
Mr
Clinker
be
not
his
own
man
for
eight
and
forty
hour
,
after
we
get
ashore
  
<EOS>
It
be
well
for
some

that
we
scape
drounde

for
mistress
be
very
frexious

and
seem

indifferently
prepared
for
a
change
;
but
,
thank
God
,
she
be
soon
put
in
a
well
frame
by
the
private
exaltation
of
the
reverend
Mr
Macrcodile

<EOS>
We
afterwards
churn
to
Starling
and
Grascow

which
be
a
kiple
of
handsome

and
then
we
go
to
a

Loff

Loming

It

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
the

in

a

and
they
steal
away

if
so
be

<EOS>
that

I
cross

and
she
tell

such

but
it
shall

as
I

the
advise

and
<EOS>
so
I
go

maid

and
we
bathe
in
our
birth

day
soot

after
the

and
behold
,
whilst
we
dabble
in
the

sir
George
Coon
start
up

but
we
clapt

and
pass
by

but
the

<EOS>
Our

would
not

because
he

He

the

could
not
have
make
his

his

shatter

but
he

DEAR
KNIGHT
,
once
more
I
tread
upon
english
ground
,
which
I
like
not
the
bad
for
the
six
week
's
ramble
<EOS>
I
have
make
among
the
wood
and
mountain
of
Caledonia
;
no
offence
to
the
land
of
cake
,
where
bannock
grow
upon
straw
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
my
uncle
in
such
health
and
spirit
and
he
now
enjoy
.
<EOS>
Liddy
be
perfectly
recover
;
and
Mrs
Tabitha
have
no
reason
to
complain
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
I
believe
,
she
be
,
till
yesterday
,
incline
to
give
the
whole
Scotch
nation
to
the
devil
,
as
a
pack
of
insensible
brute
,
upon
whom
her
accomplishment
have
be
display
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
at
every
place
where
we
halt
,
do
she
mount
the
stage
,
and
flourish
her
rusty
arm
,
without
be
able
to
make
one
conquest
.
<EOS>
one
of
her
last
essay
be
against
the
heart
of
sir
George
Calquhoun
,
with
whom
she
fight
all
the
weapon
more
than
twice
over
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
grave
and
gay
by
turn
 
<EOS>
she
moralize
and
methodize
 
<EOS>
she
laugh
,
and
romp
,
and
dance
,
and
sung
,
and
sigh
,
and
ogle
,
and
lisp
,
and
stutter
,
and
flatter
 
but
all
be
preach
to
the
desart
  
<EOS>
the
baronet
,
be
a
well
-
breed
man
,
carry
his
civility
as
far
as
she
could
in
conscience
expect
,
and
,
if
evil
tongue
be
to
be
believe
,
some
degree
farther
;
but
he
be
too
much
a
veteran
in
gallantry
,
as
well
as
in
war
,
to
fall
into
any
ambuscade
that
she
could
lay
for
his
affection
.
  
<EOS>
while
we
be
absent
in
the
Highlands
,
she
practise
also
upon
the
laird
of
Ladrishmore
,
and
even
give
him
the
rendezvous
in
the
wood
of
Drumscailloch
;
but
the
laird
have
such
a
reverend
care
of
his
own
reputation
,
that
he
come
attend
with
the
parson
of
the
parish
,
and
nothing
pass
but
spiritual
communication
.
  
<EOS>
after
all
these
miscarriage
,
our
aunt
suddenly
recollect
lieutenant
Lismahago
.
<EOS>
whom
,
ever
since
our
first
arrival
at
Edinburgh
,
she
seem
to
have
utterly
forget
;
but
now
she
express
her
hope
of
see
him
at
dumfrie
,
accord
to
his
promise
.
    
<EOS>
We
set
out
from
Glasgow
by
the
way
of
Lanerk
,
the
country
-
town
of
Clydesdale
,
in
the
neighbourhood
of
which
,
the
whole
river
Clyde
,
rush
down
a
steep
rock
,
form
a
very
noble
and
stupendous
cascade
.
<EOS>
next
day
we
be
oblige
to
halt
in
a
small
borough
,
until
the
carriage
,
which
have
receive
some
damage
,
should
be
repair
;
and
here
we
meet
with
an
incident
which
warmly
interest
the
benevolent
spirit
of
Mr
Bramble
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
stand
at
the
window
of
an
inn
that
front
the
public
prison
,
a
person
arrive
on
horseback
,
genteelly
,
tho
'
plainly
,
dress
in
a
blue
frock
,
<EOS>
with
his
own
hair
cut
short
,
and
a
gold

laced
hat
upon
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
alighting
,
and
give
his
horse
to
the
landlord
,
he
advance
to
an
old
man
who
be
at
work
in
pave
the
street
,
and
accost
him
in
these
word
:
"
this
be
hard
work
for
such
an
old
man
as
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
take
the
instrument
out
of
his
hand
,
and
begin
to
thump
the
pavement
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
few
stroke
,
"
have
you
never
a
son
(
say
he
)
to
ease
you
of
this
labour
?
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
an
please
your
honour

(
reply
the
senior
)
<EOS>
I
have
three
hopeful
lad
,
but
,
at
present
,
they
be
out
of
the
way
.
"
<EOS>
"
honour
not
me
(
cry
the
stranger
)
;
it
more
become
me
to
honour
your
grey
hair
.
  
<EOS>
where
be
those
son
you
talk
of
?
<EOS>
"
the
ancient
paviour
say
,
his
eld
son
be
a
captain
in
the
East
-
Indies
;
and
the
young
have
lately
inliste
as
a
soldier
;
in
hope
of
prosper
like
his
brother
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
desire
to
know
what
be
become
of
the
second
,
he
wipe
his
eye
,
and
own
,
he
have
take
upon
him
his
old
father
's
debt
,
for
which
he
be
now
in
the
prison
hard
by
.
    
<EOS>
the
traveller
make
three
quick
step
towards
the
gaol
,
then
turn
short
,
"
tell
me
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
have
that
unnatural
captain
send
you
nothing
to
relive
your
distress
?
"
<EOS>
"
call
him
not
unnatural
(
reply
the
the
other
)
;
God
's
blessing
be
upon
him
!
<EOS>
he
send
me
a
great
deal
of
money
;
but
I
make
a
bad
use
of
it
;
I
lose
it
by
be
security
for
a
gentleman
that
be
my
landlord
,
and
be
stript
of
all
I
have
in
the
world
besides
.
"
<EOS>
at
that
instant
a
young
man
,
thrust
out
his
head
and
neck
between
two
iron
bar
in
the
prison
window
,
exclaim
,
"
Father

<EOS>
father
!
<EOS>
if
my
brother
William
be
in
life
,
that
be
he

<EOS>
"
I
be

<EOS>
I
be

<EOS>
(
cry
the
stranger
,
clasp
the
old
man
in
his
arm
,
and
shed
a
flood
of
tear
)
 
<EOS>
I
be
your
son
<EOS>
Willy
,
sure
enough
!
<EOS>
before
the
father
,
who
be
quite
confound
,
could
make
any
return
to
this
tenderness
,
a
decent
old
woman
bolt
out
from
the
door
of
a
poor
habitation
,
cry
,
"
<EOS>
where
be
my
bairn
?
<EOS>
where
be
my
dear
Willy
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
captain
no
sooner
beheld
her
,
than
he
quit
his
father
,
and
run
into
her
embrace
.
    
<EOS>
I
can
assure
you
,
my
uncle
,
who
see
and
hear
every
thing
that
pass
,
be
as
much
move
as
any
one
of
the
party
concern
in
this
pathetic
recognition
.
  
<EOS>
He
sob
,
and
weep
,
and
clap
his
hand
,
and
hollow
,
and
finally
run
down
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
the
captain
have
retire
with
his
parent
,
and
all
the
inhabitant
of
the
place
be
assemble
at
the
door

<EOS>
Mr
Bramble
,
nevertheless
,
pressed
thro

the
crowd
,
and
enter
the
house
,
"
Captain

say
he
)
<EOS>
I
beg
the
favour
of
your
acquaintance
  
<EOS>
I
would
have
travel
a
hundred
mile
to
see
this
affect
scene

and
I
shall
think
myself
happy
,
if
you
and
your
parent
will
dine
with
me
at
the
public
house
.
<EOS>
"
the
captain
thank
him
for
his
kind
invitation
,
which
,
he
say
,
he
would
accept
with
pleasure
;
but
,
in
the
mean
time
,
he
could
not
think
of
eating
or
drink
,
while
his
poor
brother
be
in
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
He
forthwith
deposit
a
sum
equal
to
the
debt
in
the
hand
of
the
magistrate
,
who
venture
to
set
his
brother
at
liberty
without
farth
process
;
and
then
the
whole
family
repair

inn
with
my

attend
by
the
crowd

the
individual
of
which
shake
their

hand
,
while
he
return
their
caress
without
the
least
sign
of
pride
or
affectation
.
    
<EOS>
this
honest
favourite
of
fortune
,
whose
name
be
Brown
,
tell
my
uncle
,
that
he
have
be
breed
a
weaver
,
and
,
about
eighteen
year

from
a
spirit
of
idleness
and
dissipation
,
enlist
as
a
soldier
in
the
service
of

;
that
,
in
the
course
of
duty
,
he
have
the
good
fortune
to
attract
the
notice
and
approbation
of
lord
Clive

who
prefer

,
till
he
attain
the

and
pay

master
to
the
regiment
,
in
which
capacity
he
have
honestly
amass
above
twelve
thousand
pound
,
and
,
at
the
peace
,
resign
his
commission
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
send
several
remittance
to
his
father
,
who
receive
the
first
only
,
consist
of
one
hundred
pound
;
the
second
have
fall
into
the
hand
of
a
bankrupt
;
and
the
third
have
be
consign

a
gentleman
of
Scotland
,
who
die
before
it
arrive
;
so
that
it
still
remain
to
be
account
for
by
his
executor
.
<EOS>
He
now
present
the
old
man
with
fifty
pound
for
his
present
occasion
,
over
and
above
bank
note
for
one
hundred
,
which
he
have
deposit
for
his
brother

release
.
  
<EOS>
He
bring
along
with
him
a
deed
ready
execute
,
by
which
he
settle
a
perpetuity
of
four
-
score
pound
upon
his
parent
,
to
be
inherit
by
their
other
two
son
after
their
decease
.
  
<EOS>
He
promise
to
purchase
a
commission
for
his
young
brother
;
to
take
the
other
as
his
own
partner
in
a
manufacture
which
he
intend
to
set
up
,
to
give
employment
and
bread
to
the
industrious

and
to
give
five
hundred
pound

by
way
of

,
to
his

<EOS>
finally
,

fifty
pound

the
poor
of
the
town
where
he
be
bear
,
and
feast
all
the
inhabitant
without
exception
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
be
so
charm
with
the
character
of
captain
Brown
,
that
he
drink
his
health
three
time
successively
at
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
he
be
proud
of
his
acquaintance
;
that
he
be
an
honour
to
his
country
,
and
have
in
some
measure
redeem
human
nature
from
the
reproach
of
pride
,
selfishness
,
and
ingratitude
.
  
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
be
as
much
pleased
with
the
modesty
as
with
the
filial
virtue
of
this
honest
soldier
,
who
assume
no
merit
from
his
success
,
and
say
very
little
of
his
own
transaction
,
though
the
answer
he
make
to
our
inquiry
be
equally
sensible
and
laconic
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
behave
very
graciously
to
him
untill
<EOS>
she
understand
that
he
be
go
to
make
a
tender
of
his
hand
to
a
person
of
low
estate
,
who
have
be
his
sweet
-
heart
while
he
work
as
a
journeyman
weaver
.
  
<EOS>
Our
aunt
be
no
sooner
make
acquainted
with
this
design
,
than
she
starch
up
her
behaviour
with
a
double
proportion
of
reserve
;
and
when
the
company
break
up
,
she
observe
,
with
a
toss
of
her
nose
,
that
Brown
be
a
civil
fellow
enough
,
consider
the
lowness
of
his
origin
;
but
that
Fortune
,
though
she
have
mend
his
circumstance
,
be
incapable
to
raise
his
idea
,
which
be
still
humble
and
plebeian
.
    
<EOS>
on
the
day
that
succeed
this
adventure
,
we
go
some
mile
out
of
our
road
to
see
Drumlanrig
,
a
seat
belong
to
the
duke
of
Queensbury
,
which
appear
like
a
magnificent
palace
erect
by
magic
,
in
the
midst
of
a
wilderness
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
a
princely
mansion
,
with
suitable
park
and
plantation
,
render
still
more
striking
by
the
nakedness
of
the
surround
country
,
which
be
one
of
the
wild
tract
in
all
Scotland
.
  
<EOS>
this
wildness
,
however
,
be
different
from
that
of
the
Highlands
;
for
here
the
mountain
,
instead
of
heath
,
be
cover
with
a
fine
green
sward
,
afford
pasture
to
innumerable
flock
of
sheep
.
<EOS>
but
the
fleece
of
this
country
,
call
Nithsdale
,
be
not
comparable
to
the
wool
of
Galloway
,
which
be
say
to
equal
that
of
Salisbury
plain
.
<EOS>
have
pass
the
night
at
the
castle
of
Drumlanrig
,
by
invitation
from
the
duke
himself
,
who
be
one
of
the
good
man
that
ever
breathe
,
we
prosecute
our
journey
to
dumfrie
,
a
very
elegant
trading
town
near
the
border
of
England
,
where
we
find
plenty
of
good
provision
and
excellent
wine
,
at
very
reasonable
price
,
and
the
accommodation
as
good
in
all
respect
as
in
any
part
of
South
-
Britain
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
be
confine
to
Scotland
for
life
,
I
would
choose
dumfrie
as
the
place
of
my
residence
.
<EOS>
here
we
make
enquiry
about
captain
Lismahago
,
of
whom
hear
no
tiding
,
we
proceed
,
by
the
Solway
Frith
,
to
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
that
the
Solway
sand
,
upon
which
traveller
pass
at
low
water
,
be
exceedingly
dangerous
,
because
,
as
the
tide
make
,
they
become
quick
in
different
place
,
and
the
flood
rush
in
so
impetuously
,
that
passenger
be
often
overtake
by
the
sea
,
and
perish
.
    
<EOS>
in
cross
these
treacherous
Syrtes
with
a
guide
we
perceive
a
drowned
horse
,
which
Humphry
Clinker
,
after
due
inspection
,
declare
to
be
the
very
identical
beast
which
Mr
Lismahago
ride
when
he
part
with
us
at
Felton
-
bridge
in
Northumberland
.
<EOS>
this
information
,
which
seem
to
intimate
that
our
friend
the
lieutenant
have
share
the
fate
of
his
horse
,
affect
us
all
,
and
above
all
our
aunt
Tabitha
,
who
shed
salt
tear
,
and
oblige
Clinker
to
pull
a
few
hair
out
of
the
dead
horse
's
tail
,
to
be
wear
in
a
ring
as
a
remembrance
of
his
master
:
but
<EOS>
her
grief
and
our
be
not
of
long
duration
;
for
one
of
the
first
person
we
see

dealer
for
another

in

of

<EOS>
Mrs
Bramble
be
the
first
that
perceive
him
,
and
scream
as
if
she
have
see
a
ghost

and
truly
,
at
a
proper
time
and
place
,
he
may
very
well
have
pass
for
an
inhabitant
of
another
world
;
for
he
be
more
meagre
and
grim
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
We
receive
him
the
more
cordially
for
have
suppose
he
hath
be
drown
;
and
he
be
not
deficient
in
expression
of
satisfaction
at
this
meeting
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
us
,
he
have
enquire
for
us
at
dumfrie
,
and
be
inform
by
a
travel
merchant
from
Glascow
,
that
we
have
resolve
to
return
by
the
way
of
Coldstream
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
that
,
in
pass
the
sand
without
a
guide
,
his
horse
have
knock
up
;
and
he
himself
must
have
perish
,
if
he
have
not
be
providentially
relieve
by
a
return
post
-
chaise
.
  
<EOS>
He
moreover
give
us
to
understand
,
that
his
scheme
of
settle
in
his
own
country
have
miscarry
,
he
be
so
far
on
his
way
to
London
,
with
a
view
to
embark
for
North
-
America
;
where
he
intend
to
pass
the
rest
of
his
day
among
his
old
friend
the
Miamis
,
and
amuse
himself
in
finish
the
education
of
the
son
he
have
by
his
beloved
Squinkinacoosta
.
    
<EOS>
this
project
be
by
no
mean
agreeable
to
our
good
aunt
,
who
expatiate
upon
the
fatigue
and
danger
that
would
attend
such
a
long
voyage
by
sea
,
and
afterwards
such
a
tedious
journey
by
land
  
<EOS>
She
enlarge
particularly
on
the
risque
he
would
run
with
respect
to
the
concern
of
his
precious
soul
,
among
savage
who
have
not
yet
receive
the
glad
tiding
of
salvation
;
and
she
hint
that
his
abandon
Great
-
Britain
may
,
perhaps
,
prove
fatal
to
the
inclination
of
some
deserve
person
,
whom
he
be
qualified
to
make
happy
for
life
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
who
be
really
a
Don
Quixote
in
generosity
,
understand
that
Lismahago
's
real
reason
for
leave
Scotland
be
the
impossibility
of
subsist
in
it
with
any
decency
upon
the
wretched
provision
of
a
subaltern
's
half
-
pay
,
begin
to
be
warmly
interested
on
the
side
of
compassion
  
<EOS>
He
think
it
very
hard
,
that
a
gentleman
,
who
have
serve
his
country
with
honour
,
should
be
drive
by
necessity
to
spend
his
old
age
,
among
the
refuse
of
mankind
,
in
such
a
remote
part
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
He
discourse
with
me
upon
the
subject
;
observe
,
that
he
would
willingly
offer
the
lieutenant
an
asylum
at
brambleton
-
hall
,
if
he
do
not
foresee
that
his
singularity
and
humour
of
contradiction
would
render
him
an
intolerable
housemate
,
though
his
conversation
at
some
time
may
be
both
instructive
and
entertaining
:
but
as
there
seem
to
be
something
particular
in
his
attention
to
Mrs
Thabitha
,
he
and
I
agree
in
opinion
,
that
this
intercourse
should
be
encourage
,
and
improve
,
if
possible
,
into
a
matrimonial
union
;
in
which
case
there
would
be
a
comfortable
provision
for
both
;
and
they
may
be
settle
in
a
house
of
their
own
,
so
that
Mrs
Bramble
should
have
no
more
of
their
company
than
he
desire
.
    
<EOS>
in
pursuance
of
this
design
,
Lismahago
have
be
invite
to
pass
the
winter
at
Brambleton
-
hall
,
as
it
will
be
time
enough
to
execute
his
american
project
in
the
spring
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
take
time
to
consider
of
this
proposal
;
mean
while
,
he
will
keep
us
company
as
far
as
we
travel
in
the
road
to
Bristol
,
where
he
have
hope
of
get
a
passage
for
America
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
doubt
but
that
he
will
postpone
his
voyage
,
and
prosecute
his
address
to
a
happy
consummation
;
and
sure
,
if
it
produce
any
fruit
,
it
must
be
of
a
very
peculiar
flavour
.
<EOS>
as
the
weather
continue
favourable
,
I
believe
,
we
shall
take
the
Peak
of
Derbyshire
and
Buxton
Wells
in
our
way
.
  
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
from
the
first

we
make
any

you

DEAR
DOCTOR
,
the
peasantry
of
Scotland
be
certainly
on
a
poor
footing
all
over
the
kingdom
;
and
yet
they
look
well
,
and
be
better
cloathe
than
those
of
the
same
rank
in
Burgundy
,
and
many
other
place
of
France
and
Italy
;
nay
,
I
will
venture
to
say
they
be
better
feed
notwithstanding
the
boasted
wine
of
these
foreign
country
.
<EOS>
the
country
people
of
North
-
Britain
live
chiefly
on
oat
-
meal
,
and
milk
,
cheese
,
butter
,
and
some
garden
-
stuff
,
with
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
pickle
-
herre
,
by
way
of
delicacy
;
but
flesh
-
meat
<EOS>
they
seldom
or
never
taste
;
nor
any
kind
of
strong
liquor
,
except
two
-
penny
,
at
time
of
uncommon
festivity
  
Their
breakfast
be
a
kind
of
hasty
pudding
,
of
oat
-
meal
or
pease
-
meal
,
eat
with
milk
.
<EOS>
They
have
commonly
pottage
to
dinner
,
compose
of
cale
or
cole
,
leek
,
barley
or
big
,
and
butter
;
and
this
be
reinforce
with
bread
and
cheese
,
make
of
skim
-
milk
  
<EOS>
at
night
they
sup
on
sowen
or
flummery
of
oatmeal
  
<EOS>
in
a
scarcity
of
oats
,
they
use
the
meal
of
barley
and
pease
,
which
be
both
nourish
and
palatable
.
<EOS>
some
of
them
have
potato
;
and
you
find
parsnip
in
every
peasant
's
garden
  
<EOS>
They
be
cloathe
with
a
coarse
kind
of
russet
of
their
own
making
,
which
be
both
decent
and
warm
  
<EOS>
They
dwell
in
poor
hut
,
build
of
loose
stone
and
turf
,
without
any
mortar
,
have
a
fire
place
or
hearth
in
the
middle
,
generally
make
of
an
old
mill
-
stone
,
and
a
hole
at
top
to
let
out
the
smoke
.
    
<EOS>
these
people
,
however
,
be
content
,
and
wonderfully
sagacious
  
<EOS>
all
of
them
read
the
Bible
,
and
be
even
qualified
to
dispute
upon
the
article
of
their
faith
;
which
,
in
those
part
I
have
see
,
be
entirely
presbyterian
.
<EOS>
I
be
tell
,
that
the
inhabitant
of
Aberdeenshire
be
still
more
acute
.
<EOS>
I
once
know
a
Scotch
gentleman
at
London
,
who
have
declare
war
against
this
part
of
his
countryman
;
and
swear
that
the
impudence
and
knavery
of
the
Scots
,
in
that
quarter
,
have
bring
a
reproach
upon
the
whole
nation
.
    
<EOS>
the
river
Clyde
,
above
Glasgow
,
be
quite
pastoral
;
and
the
bank
of
it
be
every
where
adorn
with
fine
villas
.
<EOS>
from
the
sea
to
its
source
,
we
may
reckon
the
seat
of
many
family
of
the
first
rank
,
such
as
the
duke
of
Argyle
at
Roseneath
,
the
earl
of
Bute
in
the
isle
of
that
name
,
the
earl
of
Glencairn
at
Finlayston
;
lord
Blantyre
at
Areskine
,
the
dutchess
of
Douglas
at
Bothwell
,
duke
Hamilton
at
Hamilton
,
the
duke
of
Douglas
at
Douglas
,
and
the
earl
of
Hyndford
at
Carmichael
-
Hamilton
be
a
noble
palace
,
magnificently
furnished
;
and
hard
by
be
the
village
of
that
name
,
one
of
the
neatest
little
town
I
have
see
in
any
country
.
<EOS>
the
old
castle
of
Douglas
be
burn
to
the
ground
by
accident
,
the
late
duke
resolve
,
as
head
of
the
first
family
in
Scotland
,
to
have
the
large
house
in
the
kingdom
,
and
order
a
plan
for
this
purpose
;
but
there
be
only
one
wing
of
it
finish
when
he
die
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
hope
that
his
nephew
,
who
be
now
in
possession
of
his
great
fortune
,
will
complete
the
design
of
his
predecessor
  
Clydesdale
be
in
general
populous
and
rich
,
contain
a
great
number
of
gentleman
,
who
be
independent
in
their
fortune
;
but
it
produce
more
cattle
than
corn
  
<EOS>
this
be
also
the
case
with
Tweedale
,
through
part
of
which
we
pass
,
and
Nisdale
,
which
be
generally
rough
,
wild
,
and
mountainous
  
these
hill
be
cover
with
sheep
;
and
this
be
the
small
delicious
mutton
,
so
much
preferable
to
that
of
the
London
-
market
.
<EOS>
as
their
feeding
cost
so
little
,
the
sheep
be
not
kill
till
five
year
old
,
when
their
flesh
,
juice
,
and
flavour
,
be
in
perfection
;
but
their
fleece
be
much
damage
by
the
tar
,
with
which
they
be
smear
to
preserve
them
from
the
rot
in
winter
,
during
which
they
run
wild
night
and
day
,
and
thousand
be
lose
under
huge
wreath
of
snow
  
'
<EOS>
tis
pity
the
farmer
can
not
contrive
some
mean
to
shelter
this
useful
animal
from
the
inclemency
of
a
rigorous
climate
,
especially
from
the
perpetual
rain
,
which
be
more
prejudicial
than
the
great
extremity
of
cold
weather
.
    
<EOS>
on
the
little
river
Nid
,
be
situate
the
castle
of
Drumlanrig
,
one
of
the
noble
seat
in
Great
-
Britain
,
belong
to
the
duke
of
Queensberry
;
one
of
those
few
nobleman
whose
goodness
of
heart
do
honour
to
human
-
nature
  
<EOS>
I
shall
not
pretend
to
enter
into
a
description
of
this
palace
,
which
be
really
an
instance
of
the
sublime
in
magnificence
,
as
well
as
in
situation
,
and
put
one
in
mind
of
the
beautiful
city
of
Palmyra
rise
like
a
vision
in
the
midst
of
the
wilderness
.
<EOS>
His
grace
keep
open
house
,
and
live
with
great
splendour
  
<EOS>
He
do
us
the
honour
to
receive
us
with
great
courtesy
,
and
detain
us
all
night
,
together
with
above
twenty
other
guest
,
with
all
their
servant
and
horse
,
to
a
very
considerable
number
  
the
dutchess
be
equally
gracious
,
and
take
our
lady
under
her
immediate
protection
.
<EOS>
the
longer
I
live
,
I
see
more
reason
to
believe
that
prejudice
of
education
be
never
wholly
eradicate
,
even
when
they
be
discover
to
be
erroneous
and
absurd
.
<EOS>
such
habit
of
think
as
interest
<EOS>
the
grand
passion
,
cleave
to
the
human
heart
in
such
a
manner
,
that
though
an
effort
of
reason
may
force
them
from
their
hold
for
a
moment
,
this
violence
no
sooner
cease
,
than
they
resume
their
grasp
with
an
encreased
elasticity
and
adhesion
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
lead
into
this
reflection
,
by
what
pass
at
the
duke
's
table
after
supper
.
<EOS>
the
conversation
turn
upon
the
vulgar
notion
of
spirit
and
omen
,
that
prevail
among
the
commonalty
of
North
-
Britain
,
and
,
all
the
company
agree
,
that
nothing
could
be
more
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
one
gentleman
however
tell
a
remarkable
story
of
himself
,
by
way
of
speculation
  
"
be
on
a
party
of
hunting
in
the
North
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
I
resolve
to
visit
an
old
friend
,
whom
I
have
not
see
for
twenty
year
<EOS>
so
long
he
have
be
retire
and
sequester
from
all
his
acquaintance
,
and
live
in
a
mope
melancholy
way
,
much
afflict
with
lowness
of
spirit
,
occasion
by
the
death
of
his
wife
,
whom
he
have
love
with
uncommon
affection
.
<EOS>
as
he
reside
in
a
remote
part
of
the
country
,
and
we
be
five
gentleman
with
as
many
servant
,
we
carry
some
provision
with
us
from
the
next
market
town
,
lest
we
should
find
him
unprepared
for
our
reception
:
<EOS>
the
road
be
bad
<EOS>
,
we
do
not
arrive
at
the
house
till
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
;
and
be
agreeably
surprised
to
find
a
very
good
dinner
ready
in
the
kitchen
,
and
the
cloth
lay
with
six
cover
.
<EOS>
My
friend
himself
appear
in
his
good
apparel
at
the
gate
,
and
receive
us
with
open
arm
,
tell
me
he
have
be
expect
us
these
two
hour
  
<EOS>
astonish
at
this
declaration
,
I
ask
who
have
give
him
intelligence
of
our
come
?
<EOS>
and
he
smile
without
make
any
other
reply
  
however
,
presume
upon
our
former
intimacy
<EOS>
,
I
afterwards
insist
upon
know
;
and
he
tell
me
,
very
gravely
,
he
have
see
me
in
a
vision
of
the
second
sight
  
<EOS>
Nay
,
he
call
in
the
evidence
of
his
steward
,
who
solemnly
declare
,
that
his
master
have
the
day
before
apprise
him
of
my
coming
,
with
four
other
stranger
,
and
order
him
to
provide
accordingly
;
in
consequence
of
which
intimatition
,
he
have
prepare
the
dinner
which
we
be
then
eat
;
and
lay
the
cover
accord
to
the
number
foretold
.
<EOS>
"
the
incident
we
all
own
to
be
remarkable
,
and
I
endeavour
to
account
for
it
by
natural
mean
.
<EOS>
I
observe
,
that
as
the
gentleman
be
of
a
visionary
turn
,
the
casual
idea
,
or
remembrance
of
his
old
friend
,
may
suggest
those
circumstance
,
which
accident
have
for
once
realize
;
but
that
in
all
probability
he
have
see
many
vision
of
the
same
kind
,
which
be
never
verify
.
<EOS>
none
of
the
company
directly
dissent
from
my
opinion
;
but
from
the
objection
that
be
hint
,
I
could
plainly
perceive
,
that
the
majority
be
persuade
there
be
something
more
extraordinary
in
the
case
.
    
<EOS>
another
gentleman
of
the
company
address
himself
to
me
,
"
<EOS>
without
all
doubt
,
(
say
he
)
a
deceased
imagination
be
very
apt
to
produce
vision
;
but
we
must
find
some
other
method
to
account
for
something
of
this
kind
,
that
happen
within
these
eight
day
in
my
neighbourhood
  
<EOS>
a
gentleman
of
a
good
family
,
who
can
not
be
deem
a
visionary
in
any
sense
of
the
word
,
be
near
his
own
gate
,
in
the
twilight
,
visit
by
his
grandfather
,
who
have
be
dead
these
fifteen
year
  
<EOS>
the
spectre
be
mount
seemingly
on
the
very
horse
he
use
to
ride
,
with
an
angry
and
terrible
countenance
,
and
say
something
,
which
his
grandson
,
in
the
confusion
of
his
fear
,
could
not
understand
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
all
  
<EOS>
He
lift
up
a
huge
horsewhip
,
and
apply
it
with
great
violence
to
his
back
and
shoulder
,
on
which
I
see
the
impression
with
my
own
eye
.
<EOS>
the
apparition
be
afterwards
see
by
the
sexton
of
the
parish
,
hover
about
the
tomb
where
his
body
lie
inter
;
as
the
man
declare
to
several
person
in
the
village
,
before
he
know
what
have
happen
to
the
gentleman

Nay
,
he
actually
come
to
me
as
a
justice
of
the
peace
,
in
order
to
make
oath
of
these
particular
,
which
,
however
,
I
decline
administer
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
grandson
of
the
defunct

he
be
a
sober
,
sensible
,
worldly
-
minded
fellow
,
too
intent
upon
scheme
of
interest
to
give
into
reverie
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
willingly
conceal
the
affair
;
but
he
bawl
out
in
the
first
transport
of
his
fear
,
and
run
into
the
house
,
expose
his
back
and
his
sconce
to
the
whole
family
;
so
that
there
be
no
deny
it
in
the
sequel
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
the
common
discourse
of
the
country
,
that
this
appearance
and
behaviour
of
the
old
man
's
spirit
,
portend
some
great
calamity
to
the
family
,
and
the
good

woman
have
actually
take
to
her
bed
in
this
apprehension
.
"
    
<EOS>
Though
I
do
not
pretend
to
explain
this
mystery
<EOS>
I
say
,
I
do
not
at
all
doubt
,
but
it
would
one
day
appear
to
be
a
deception
;
and
,
in
all
probability
,
a
scheme
execute
by
some
enemy
of
h
person
who
have
sustain
the
assault
;
but
<EOS>
still
the
gentleman
insist
upon
the
clearness
of
the
evidence
,
and
the
concurrence
of
testimony
,
by
which
two
creditable
witness
,
without
any
communication
one
with
another
,
affirm
the
appearance
of
the
same
man
,
with
whose
person
they
be
both
well
acquaint
  
<EOS>
from
Drumlanrig
we
pursue
the
course
of
the
Nid
to
dumfrie
,
which
stand
several
mile
above
the
place
where
the
river
fall
into
the
sea
;
and
be
,
after
Glasgow
,
the
handsome
town
I
have
see
in
Scotland
  
<EOS>
the
inhabitant
,
indeed
,
seem
to
have
propose
that
city
as
their
model
;
not
only
in
beautify
their
town
and
regulate
its
police
,
but
also
in
prosecute
their
scheme
of
commerce
and
manufacture
,
by
which
they
be
grow
rich
and
opulent
.
    
<EOS>
We
re
-
enter
England
,
by
the
way
of
Carlisle
,
where
we
accidently
meet
with
our
friend
Lismahago
,
whom
we
have
in
vain
enquire
after
at
dumfrie
and
other
place
  
<EOS>
It
would
seem
that
the
captain
,
like
the
prophet
of
old
,
be
but
little
honoured
in
his
own
country
,
which
he
have
now
renounce
for
ever
  
<EOS>
He
give
me
the
follow
particular
of
his
visit
to
his
native
soil
  
<EOS>
in
his
way
to
the
place
of
his

,
he
learn
that
his

have
marry
the
daughter
of
a
burgeois
,
who
direct
a
weaving
manufacture
,
and
have
go
into
partnership
with
his

chagrin
with
this
information

he
have
arrive
at
the
gate
in
the
twilight
,
where
he
hear
the
sound
of
treddle
in
the
great
hall
,
which
have
exasperate
him
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
have
like
to
have
lose
his

:
while
he
be
thus
transport
with
indignation
,
his
nephew
chance
to
come
forth
,
when
,
be
no
longer
master
of
his

he
cry
,
"
degenerate
rascal

<EOS>
you
have
make
my
father
's
house
a
den
of
thief
;
"
and
at
the
same
time
chastise
him
with
his
horse
-
whip
;
then
,
ride
round
the
adjoining
village
,
he
have
visit
the
burying
-
ground
of
his
ancestor
by
moon
-
light
;
and
,
have
pay
his
respect
to
their
mane
,
travel
all
night
to
another
part
of
the
country
  
find
the
head
of
his
family
in
such
a
disgraceful
situation
,
all
his
own
friend
dead
or
remove
from
the
place
of
their
former
residence
,
and
the
expence
of
living
encrease
to
double
of
what
it
have
be
,
when
he
first
leave
his
native
country
,
he
have
bid
it
an
eternal
adieu

and
be
determined
to
seek
for
repose
among
the
forest
of
America

<EOS>
I
be
no
longer
at
a
loss
to
account
for
the
apparition
,
which
have
be
describe
at
Drumlanrig

and
when
I
repeat
the
story
to
the
lieutenant
,
he
be
much
pleased
to
think
his
resentment
have
be
so
much
more
effectual
than
he
intend
;
and
he
own
,
he
may
at
such
an
hour
,
and
in
such
an
equipage
,
very
well
pass
for
the
ghost
of
his
father
,
whom
he
be

greatly
to
resemble

I
fancy
Lismahago
will
find
a

My

if

the

be
dispose
to
take
opportunity
by
the

<EOS>
for
my

I
intend
to
encourage
this

shall
be
glad
to

unite

in

we

I
,
and
my

will
get
rid

I
shall
have
the
benefit
of
Lismahago

without
be
oblige
to
take
more

I

I

I
be
much
pleased

Manchester

I

this

animate

<EOS>
We

You

DEAR

LISMAHAGO
be

<EOS>
the
late

he
have

seem

have
blow
fresh

all
his

<EOS>
I
congratulate
him
the
other
day
on
the
present
flourish
state
of
his
country

observe
that
the
Scots
be
now
in
a
fair
way
to
wipe
off
the
national
reproach
of
poverty

and
express
my
satisfaction
at
the
happy

so
conspicuous

up
his

dissent

comment

my
remark
to
this
effect
  
<EOS>
"
those
who
reproach
a
nation
for
its
poverty
,
when
it
be
not
owe
to
the
profligacy
or
vice
of
the
people
,
deserve
no
answer
.
<EOS>
the
Lacedaemonians
be
poor
than
the
Scots
,
when
they
take
the
lead
among
all
the
free
state
of
Greece
,
and
be
esteem
above
them
all
for
their
valour
and
their
virtue
.
<EOS>
the
most
respectable
hero
of
ancient
Rome
,
such
as
Fabricius
,
Cincinnatus
,
and
Regulus
,
be
poor
than
the
poor
freeholder
in
Scotland
;
and
there
be
at
this
day
individual
in
North
-
Britain
,
one
of
whom
can
produce
more
gold
and
silver
than
the
whole
public
of
Rome
could
raise
at
those
time
when
her
public
virtue
shine
with
unrivalled
lustre
;
and
poverty
be
so
far
from
be
a
reproach
,
that
it
add
fresh
laurel
to
her
fame
,
because
it
indicate
a
noble
contempt
of
wealth
,
which
be
proof
against
all
the
art
of
corruption
  
<EOS>
if
poverty
be
a
subject
for
reproach
,
it
follow
that
wealth
be
the
object
of
esteem
and
veneration
  
<EOS>
in
that
case
,
there
be
Jews
and
other
in
Amsterdam
and
London
,
enrich
by
usury
,
peculation
,
and
different
specie
of
fraud
and
extortion
,
who
be
more
estimable
than
the
most
virtuous

illustrious
member
of
the

<EOS>
an
absurdity
which
no
man
in
his
sense
will
offer
to
maintain

<EOS>
rich
be
certainly
no
proof
of
merit

<EOS>
nay
,
they
be
often
(
if
not
most
commonly
)
acquire
by
person
of
sordid
mind
and
mean
talent
:
nor
do
they
give
any
intrinsic

to
the
possessor

but
,
on
the
contrary
,
tend
to
pervert
his
understanding
,
and
render
this
moral
more
depraved
.
<EOS>
but
grant
that
poverty
be
really
matter
of
reproach
,
it
can
not
be
justly
impute
to
Scotland
.
<EOS>
no
country
be
poor
that
can
supply
its
inhabitant
with
the
necessary
of
life
,
and
even
afford
article
for
exportation
.
<EOS>
Scotland
be
rich
in
natural
advantage
:
it
produce
every
species
of
provision
in
abundance
,
vast
herd
of
cattle
and
flock
of
sheep
,
with
a
great
number
of
horse
;
prodigious
quantity
of
wool
and
flax
,
with
plenty
of
copse
wood
,
and
in
some
part
large
forest
of
timber
.
<EOS>
the
earth
be
still
more
rich
below
than
above
the
surface
.
<EOS>
It
yield
inexhaustible
store
of
coal
,
free
-
stone
,
marble
,
lead
,
iron
,
copper
,
and
silver

with
some
gold
.
<EOS>
the
sea
abound
with
excellent
fish
,
and
salt
to
cure
them
for
exportation
;
and
there
be
creek

harbour
round

for

<EOS>
the

display
a
surprising
number
of
city

town

swarm

there
seem

be
no

such

the

you
seem

derive

<EOS>
I
say
,
I
suppose
he
would
not
deny
that
the
appearance
of
the
country
be
much
mend
;
that
the

live
better
,
have
more
trade
,
and
a
great
quantity
of
money
circulate
since
the
union
,
than
before
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
safely
admit
these
premise
,
(
answer
the
lieutenant
)
without
subscribe
to
your
inference
.
<EOS>
the
difference
you
mention
<EOS>
,
I
should
take
to
be
the
natural
progress
of
improvement
  
since
that
period
,
other
nation
,
such
as
the
Swedes
,
the
Danes
,
and
in
particular
the
French
,
have
greatly
increase
in
commerce
,
without
any
such
cause
assign
.
<EOS>
before
the
union
,
there
be
a
remarkable
spirit
of
trade
among
the
Scots
,
as
appear
in
the
case
of
their
Darien
company
,
in
which
they
have
embark
on
less
than
four
hundred
thousand
pound
sterling
;
and
in
the
flourish
state
of
the
maritime
town
in
Fife
,
and
on
the
eastern
coast
,
enrich
by
their
trade
with
France
,
which
fail
in
consequence
of
the
union
.
<EOS>
the
only
solid
commercial
advantage
reap
from
that
measure
,
be
the
privilege
of
trading
to
the
english
plantation
;
yet
,
except
Glasgow
and
Dumfries
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
know
any
other
Scotch
town
concern
in
that
traffick
.
<EOS>
in
other
respect
,
I
conceive

you

in

the
sixteen

you

Sir

(

<EOS>
they
generally
side
with
the

so
much
the
bad
for
their

even
this
evil
be
not
the

I
beg

at

allow

"
<EOS>
all
these
,
(
say
he
)
become
english
subject

to
all
intent

purpose
,
and
be
in
a
great
measure
lose

country

<EOS>
the
spirit
of
rambling
and
adventure
have
be
always
peculiar
to
the
native
of
Scotland
.
<EOS>
if
they
have
not
meet
with
encouragement
in
England

they
would
have
serve

for

what
have
England
get
by
this

which
,
you
say

have
be
so
productive
of
misfortune
to
the
Scots

"
<EOS>
"
great
and
manifold
be
the
advantage
which
England
derive
from
the
union
(
say
Lismahago
,
in
a
solemn
tone
.
)
<EOS>
first
and
foremost
,
the
settlement
of
the
protestant
succession
,
a
point
which
the
english
ministry
drive
with
such
eagerness
that
no
stone
be
leave
unturned
,
to
cajole
and
bribe
a
few
lead
man
,
to
cram
the
union
down
the
throat
of
the
scottish
nation
,
who
where
surprisingly
reverse
to
the
expedient
.
<EOS>
They
gain
by
it
a
considerable
addition
of
territory
,
extend
their
dominion
to
the
sea
on
all
side
of
the
island
,
thereby
shut
up
all
back
-
door
against
the
enterprize
of
their
enemy
.
<EOS>
They
get
an
accession
of
above
a
million
of
useful
subject
,
constitute
a
never
-
fail
nursery
of
seaman
,
soldier
,
labourer
,
and
mechanic
;
a
most
valuable
acquisition
to
a
trading
country
,
expose
to
foreign
war
,
and
oblige
to
maintain
a
number
of
settlement
in
all
the
four
quarter
of
the
globe
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
seven
year
,
during
the
last
war
,
Scotland
furnish
the
English
army
and
navy
with
seventy
thousand
man
,
over
and
above
those
who
migrate
to
their
colony
,
or
mingle
with
them
at
home
in
the
civil
department
of
life
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
very
considerable
and
seasonable
supply
to
a
nation
,
whose
people
have
be
for
many
year
decrease
in
number
,
and
whose
land
and
manufacture
be
actually
suffer
for
want
of
hand
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
remind
you
of
the
hackneye
maxim
,
that
to
a
nation
in
such
circumstance
,
a
supply
of
industrious
people
be
a
supply
of
wealth
;
nor
repeat
an
observation
,
which
be
now
receive
as
an
eternal
truth
,
even
among
the
English
themselves
,
that
the
scot
who
settle
in
South
-
Britain
,
be
remarkably
sober
,
orderly
,
and
industrious
.
"
    
<EOS>
I
allow
the
truth
of
this
remark
,
add
,
that
by
their
industry
,
oeconomy
,
and
circumspection
,
many
of
them
in
England
,
as
well
as
in
her
colony
,
amass
large
fortune
,
with
which
they
return
to
their
own
country
,
and
this
be
so
much
lose
to
South
-
Britain
.
  
<EOS>
"
give
me
leave
,
sir
,
(
say
he
)
to
assure
you
,
that
in
your
fact
you
be
mistaken
,
and
in
your
deduction
,
erroneous
.
  
<EOS>
not
one
in
two
hundred
that
leave
Scotland
ever
return
to
settle
in
his
own
country
;
and
the
few
that
do
return
,
carry
thither
nothing
that
can
possibly
diminish
the
stock
of
South
-
Britain
;
for
none
of
their
treasure
stagnate
in
Scotland
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
continual
circulation
,
like
that
of
the
blood
in
the
human
body
,
and
England
be
the
heart
,
to
which
all
the
stream
which
it
distribute
be
refund
and
return
:
nay
,
in
consequence
of
that
luxury
which
our
connexion
with
England
hath
greatly
encourage
,
if
not
introduce
,
all
the
produce
of
our
land
,
and
all
the
profit
of
our
trade
,
be
engross
by
the
native
of
South
-
Britain
;
for
you
will
find
that
the
exchange
between
the
two
kingdom
be
always
against
Scotland
;
and
that
she
retain
neither
gold
nor
silver
sufficient
for
her
own
circulation
.
  
<EOS>
the
Scots
,
not
content
with
their
own
manufacture
and
produce
,
which
would
very
well
answer
all
necessary
occasion
,
seem
to
vie
with
each
other
in
purchase
superfluity
from
England
;
such
as
broadcloth
,
velvet
,
stuff
,
silk
,
lace
,
fur
,
jewel
,
furniture
of
all
sort
,
sugar
,
rum
,
tea
,
chocolate
,
and
coffee
;
in
a
word
,
not
only
every
mode
of
the
most
extravagant
luxury
,
but
even
many
article
of
convenience
,
which
they
may
find
as
good
,
and
much
cheap
in
their
own
country
.
<EOS>
for
all
these
particular
,
I
conceive
,
England
may
touch
about
one
million
sterling
a
-
year
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
to
make
an
exact
calculation
;
perhaps
,
it
may
be
something
less
,
and
,
perhaps
,
a
great
deal
more
.
  
<EOS>
the
annual
revenue
arise
from
all
the
private
estate
of
Scotland
can
not
fall
short
of
a
million
sterling
;
and
,
I
should
imagine
,
their
trade
will
amount
to
as
much
more
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
,
the
linen
manufacture
alone
return
near
half
a
million
,
exclusive
of
the
home
-
consumption
of
that
article
.
  
<EOS>
if
,
therefore
,
North
-
Britain
pay
a
ballance
of
a
million
annually
to
England
,
I
insist
upon
it
,
that
country
be
more
valuable
to
her
in
the
way
of
commerce
,
than
any
colony
in
her
possession
,
over
and
above
the
other
advantage
which
I
have
specify
:
therefore
,
they
be
no
friend
,
either
to
England
or
to
truth
,
who
affect
to
depreciate
the
northern
part
of
the
united
kingdom
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
I
must
own
,
I
be
at
first
a
little
nettle
to
find
myself
school
in
so
many
particular
.
<EOS>
though
I
do
not
receive
all
his
assertion
as
gospel
,
I
be
not
prepared
to
refute
them
;
and
I
can
not
help
now
acquiesce
in
his
remark
so
far
as
to
think
,
that
the
contempt
for
Scotland
,
which
prevail
too
much
on
this
side
the
Tweed
,
be
found
on
prejudice
and
error
.
  
<EOS>
after
some
recollection
,
"
well
,
captain
,
(
say
I
)
<EOS>
you
have
argue
stoutly
for
the
importance
of
your
own
country
:
for
my
part
,
I
have
such
a
regard
for
our
fellow
-
subject
of
North
-
Britain
,
that
I
shall
be
glad
to
see
the
day
,
when
your
peasant
can
afford
to
give
all
their
oat
to
their
cattle
,
hog
and
poultry
,
and
indulge
themselves
with
good
wheaten
loaf
,
instead
of
such
poor
,
unpalitable
,
and
inflammatory
diet
.
<EOS>
"
here
again
I
bring
myself
into
a
premunire
with
the
disputaceous
Caledonian
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
he
hope
he
should
never
see
the
common
people
lift
out
of
that
sphere
for
which
they
be
intend
by
nature
and
the
course
of
thing
;
that
they
may
have
some
reason
to
complain
of
their
bread
,
if
it
be
mixed
,
like
that
of
Norway
,
with
saw
-
dust
and
fish
-
bone
;
but
that
oatmeal
be
he
apprehend
,
as
nourishing
and
salutary
as
wheat
-
flour
,
and
the
Scots
in
general
think
it
at
least
as
savoury
.
  
<EOS>
He
affirm
,
that
a
mouse
,
which
,
in
the
article
of
self
-
preservation
,
may
be
suppose
to
act
from
infallible
instinct
,
would
always
prefer
oat
to
wheat
,
as
appear
from
experience
;
for
,
in
a
place
where
there
be
a
parcel
of
each
,
that
animal
have
never
begin
to
feed
upon
the
latter
till
all
the
oat
be
consume
;
for
their
nutritive
quality
,
he
appeal
to
the
hale
,
robust
constitution
of
the
people
who
live
chiefly
upon
oat
-
meal
;
and
,
instead
of
be
inflammatory
,
he
assert
,
that
it
be
a
cool
sub
-
acid
,
balsamic
and
mucilaginous
;
insomuch
,
that
in
all
inflammatory
distemper
,
recourse
be
have
to
water
-
gruel
,
and
flummery
make
of
oatmeal
.
    
<EOS>
"
at
least
(
say
I
)
give
me
leave
to
wish
them
such
a
degree
of
commerce
as
may
enable
them
to
follow
their
own
inclination
.

"
  
<EOS>

Heaven
forbid

<EOS>
Woe
be
to
that
nation

where
the
multitude
be
at
liberty
to
follow
their
own

<EOS>
Commerce
be
undoubtedly
a
blessing
,
while
restrain
within
its
proper
channel
;
but
a
glut
of
wealth
bring
along
with
it
a
glut
of
evil
;
it
bring
false
taste
,
false
appetite
,
false
want

profusion
,
venality
,
contempt
of
order

engender
a
spirit
of
licentiousness
,
insolence

and
faction
<EOS>
,
that
keep
the
community
in
continual
ferment
,
and
in
time
destroy
all
the

so
that
universal
anarchy

uproar
must
ensue

<EOS>
Will
any
sensible
man
affirm

that
the
national
advantage
of
opulence
be
to
be
seek
on
these
term

<EOS>
no

sure
;
but
I
be
one
of
those

who
think
,
that
,
by
proper
regulation

commerce
may
produce
every
national
benefit

such
concomitant
evil

<EOS>
so
much
for
the
dogmata
of
my
friend
Lismahago
,
whom
I
describe
the
more
circumstantially
as
I
firmly
believe
he
will
set
up
his
rest
in
Monmouthshire

<EOS>
yesterday
,
while
I
be
alone
with
him

he
ask
,
in
some
confusion
,
if
I
should
have
any
objection
to
the
success
of
a
gentleman
and
soldier
,
provide
he
should
be
so
fortunate
as
to
engage
my
sister
's
affection
.
<EOS>
I
answer
,
without
hesitation
,
that
my
sister
be
old
enough
to
judge
for
herself
;
and
that
I
should
be
very
far
from
disapprove
any
resolution
she
may
take
in
his
favour
.
  
<EOS>
His
eye
sparkle
at
this
declaration

<EOS>
He
declare
,
he
should
think
himself
the
happy
man
on
earth
to
be
connect
with
my
family
;
and
that
he
should
never
be
weary
of
give
me
proof
of
his
gratitude
and
attachment
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
Tabby
and
he
be
already
agree
;
in
which
case

we
shall
have
a
wedding
at
Brambleton

you
shall
give
away
the

perform
other

<EOS>
I
be
sure
it
will
be
productive
of
some
diversion

and
,
truly
,
it
would
be
worth
your
while
to
come
across
the
country
on
purpose
to
see
two
such
original
figure
in
bed
together
,
with
their
laced
night

cap
;
he
,
the
emblem
of
good
cheer

and
she

the
picture
of
good

<EOS>
all
this
agreeable
prospect
be
cloud
,
and
have
well
nigh
vanish
entirely
,
in
consequence
of
a
late
misunderstanding

a

my

go

Oxmington
at

ask
us
to
dine
with

next

leave

a

about
a

we

ever

<EOS>
His
lordship
be
much
more
remarkable
for
his
pride
and
caprice
,
than
for
his
hospitality
and
understanding
;
and
,
indeed
,
it
appear
,
that
he
consider
his
guest
merely
as
object
to
shine
upon
,
so
as
to
reflect
the
lustre
of
his
own
magnificence

there
be
much
state

propose
three
general
toast
;
then
call
for
a
glass
of
wine
,
and
bow
all
round
,
wish
us
a
good
afternoon
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
signal
for
the
company
to
break
up
,
and
they
obey
it
immediately
,
all
except
our
"
squire
,
who
be
greatly
shock
at
the
manner
of
this
dismission
.
  
<EOS>
He
change
countenance
,
bit
his
lip
in
silence
,
but
still
keep
his
seat
,
so
that
his
lordship
find
himself
oblige
to
give
us
another
hint
,
by
say
,
he
should
be
glad
to
see
us
another
time
,
"
there
be
no
time
like
the
time
present
<EOS>
(
cry
Mr
Bramble
)
;
your
lordship
have
not
yet
drink
a
bumper
to
the
good
in
Christendom
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
will
drink
no
more
bumper
to
-
day
(
answer
our
landlord
)
;
and
I
be
sorry
to
see
you
have
drink
too
many
.
  
<EOS>
order
the
gentleman
's
carriage
to
the
gate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
rise
and
retire
abruptly
;
our
"
squire
start
up
at
the
same
time
,
lay
his
hand
upon
his
sword
,
and
eye
him
with
a
most
ferocious
aspect
.
<EOS>
the
master
have
vanish
in
this
manner
,
our
uncle
bad
one
of
the
servant
to
see
what
be
to
pay
;
and
the
fellow
answering
,
"
this
be
no
inn
,
"
"
I
cry
you
mercy
,
(
cry
the
other
)
<EOS>
I
perceive
it
be
not
;
if
it
be
,
the
landlord
would
be
more
civil
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
guinea
,
however
;
take
it
,
and
tell
your
lord
,
that
I
shall
not
leave
the
country
till
I
have
have
an
opportunity
to
thank
him
in
person
for
his
politeness
and
hospitality
.
"
    
<EOS>
We
then
walk
down
stair
through
a
double
range
of
lacquey
,
and
get
into
the
chaise
,
proceed
homeward
.
<EOS>
perceive
the
"
squire
much
ruffle
,
I
venture
to
disapprove
of
his
resentment
,
observe
,
that
as
lord
Oxmington
be
well
known
to
have
his
brain
very
ill
timbere
,
a
sensible
man
should
rather
laugh
,
than
be
angry
at
his
ridiculous
want
of
breeding
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Bramble
take
umbrage
at
my
presuming
to
be
wise
than
he
upon
this
occasion
;
and
tell
me
,
that
as
he
have
always
think
for
himself
in
every
occurrence
in
life
,
he
would
still
use
the
same
privilege
,
with
my
good
leave
.
    
<EOS>
when
we
return
to
our
inn
,
he
closette
Lismahago
;
and
have
explain
his
grievance
,
desire
that
gentleman
to
go
and
demand
satisfaction
of
lord
Oxmington
in
his
name
.
  
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
charge
himself
with
this
commission
,
and
immediately
set
out
a
horseback
for
his
lordship
's
house
attend
,
at
his
own
request
,
by
my
man
Archy
Macalpine
,
who
have
be
use
to
military
service
;
and
truly
,
if
Macalpine
have
be
mount
upon
an
ass
,
this
couple
may
have
pass
for
the
knight
of
La
Mancha
and
his
"
squire
Panza
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
till
after
some
demur
that
Lismahago
obtain
a
private
audience
,
at
which
he
formally
defy
his
lordship
to
single
combat
,
in
the
name
of
Mr
Bramble
,
and
desire
him
to
appoint
the
time
and
place
.
<EOS>
Lord
Oxmington
be
so
confound
at
this
unexpected
message
,
that
he
could
not
,
for
some
time
,
make
any
articulate
reply
;
but
stand
stare
at
the
lieutenant
with
manifest
mark
of
perturbation
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
ring
a
bell
with
great
vehemence
,
he
exclaim
,
"
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
a
commoner
send
a

<EOS>
here
be
a
person
bring
me
a
challenge
from
the
Welchman
that
dine
at
my
table
 
<EOS>
an
impudent
fellow

<EOS>
My
wine
be
not
yet
out
of
his
head
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
whole
house
be
immediately
in
commotion
.
  
<EOS>
Macalpine
make
a
soldierly
retreat
with
the
two
horse
;
but
the
captain
be
suddenly
surround
and
disarm
by
the
footman
,
whom
a
French
valet
de
chambre
head
in
this
exploit
;
his
sword
be
pass
through
a
close
-
stool
,
and
his
person
through
the
horse
pond
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
plight
he
return
to
the
inn
,
half
mad
with
his
disgrace
.
  
<EOS>
so
violent
be
the
rage
of
his
indignation
,
that
he
mistake
its
object
  
<EOS>
He
want
to
quarrel
with
Mr
Bramble
;
he
say
,
he
have
be
dishonour
on
his
account
,
and
he
look
for
reparation
at
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
's
back
be
up
in
a
moment
;
and
he
desire
him
to
explain
his
pretension
  
"
either
compel
lord
Oxmington
to
give
me
satisfaction
,
(
cry
he
)
or
give
it
me
in
your
own
person
.
"
<EOS>
"
the
latter
part
of
the
alternative
be
the
most
easy
and
expeditious
(
reply
the
"
squire
,
start
up
)
:
if
you
be
dispose
for
a
walk
,
I
will
attend
you
this
moment
.
"
    
<EOS>
here
they
be
interrupt
by
Mrs
Tabby
,
who
have
overhead
all
that
pass
.
  
<EOS>
She
now
burst
into
the
room
,
and
run
betwixt
them
,
in
great
agitation
,
"
be
this
your
regard
for
me
,
(
say
she
to
the
lieutenant
)
to
seek
the
life
of
my
brother
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lismahago
,
who
seem
to
grow
cool
as
my
uncle
grow
hot
,
assure
her
he
have
a
very
great
respect
for
Mr
Bramble
,
but
he
have
still
more
for
his
own
honour
,
which
have
suffer
pollution
;
but
if
that
could
be
once
purify
,
he
should
have
no
further
cause
of
dissatisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
the
"
squire
say
,
he
should
have
think
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
vindicate
the
lieutenant
's
honour
;
but
,
as
he
have
now
carve
for
himself
,
he
may
swallow
and
digest
it
as
well
as
he
could
 
in
a
word
,
what
betwixt
the
meditation
of
Mrs
Tabitha
,
the
recollection
of
the
captain
,
who
perceive
he
have
go
too
far
,
and
the
remonstrance
if
your
humble
servant
,
who
join
them
at
this
juncture
,
those
two
original
be
perfectly
reconcile
;
and
then
we
proceed
to
deliberate
upon
the
mean
of
take
vengeance
for
the
insult
they
have
receive
from
the
petulent
peer
;
for
,
until
that
aim
should
be
accomplish
,
Mr
Bramble
swear
,
with
great
emphasis
,
that
he
would
not
leave
the
inn
where
we
now
lodge
,
even
if
he
should
pass
his
Christmas
on
the
spot
.
    
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
our
deliberation
,
we
next
day
,
in
the
forenoon
,
proceed
in
a
body
to
his
lordship
's
house
,
all
of
us
,
with
our
servant
,
include
the
coachman
,
mount
a
horseback
,
with
our
pistol
load
and
ready
prime
.
  
<EOS>
thus
prepare
for
action
,
we
parade
solemnly
and
slowly
before
his
lordship
's
gate
,
which
we
pass
three
time
in
such
a
manner
,
that
he
could
not
but
see
us
,
and
suspect
the
cause
of
our
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
after
dinner
we
return
,
and
perform
the
same
cavalcade
,
which
be
again
repeat
the
morning
follow
;
but
we
have
no
occasion
to
persist
in
these
manoeuvre
.
  
<EOS>
about
noon
,
we
be
visit
by
the
gentleman
,
at
whose
house
we
have
first
see
lord
Oxmington
.
  
<EOS>
He
now
come
to
make
apology
in
the
name
of
his
lordship
,
who
declare
he
have
no
intention
to
give
offence
to
my
uncle
in
practise
what
have
be
always
the
custom
of
his
house
;
and
that
as
for
the
indignity
which
have
be
put
upon
the
officer
,
they
be
offer
without
his
lordship
's
knowledge
,
at
the
instigation
of
his
valet
de
chambre
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
that
be
the
case
,
(
say
my
uncle
in
a
peremptory
tone
)
<EOS>
I
shall
be
content
with
lord
Oxmington
's
personal
excuse
;
and
I
hope
my
friend
will
be
satisfied
with
his
lordship
's
turn
that
insolent
rascal
out
of
his
service
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
(
cry
Lismahago
)
<EOS>
I
must
insist
upon
take
personal
vengeance
for
the
personal
injury
I
have
sustain
.
"
    
<EOS>
after
some
debate
,
the
affair
be
adjust
in
this
manner
.
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
,
meet
us
at
our
friend
's
house
,
declare
he
be
sorry
for
what
have
happen
;
and
that
he
have
no
intention
to
give
umbrage
  
<EOS>
the
valet
de
chambre
ask
pardon
of
the
lieutenant
upon
his
knee
,
when
Lismahago
,
to
the
astonishment
of
all
present
,
give
him
a
violent
kick
on
the
face
,
which
lay
him
on
his
back
,
exclaim
in
a
furious
tone
,
"
Oui
je
te
pardome
,
gens
foutre
.
"
    
<EOS>
Such
be
the
fortunate
issue
of
this
perilous
adventure
,
which
threaten
abundance
of
vexation
to
our
family
;
for
the
"
squire
be
one
of
those
who
will
sacrifice
both
life
and
fortune
,
rather
than
leave
what
they
conceive
to
be
the
least
speck
or
blemish
upon
their
honour
and
reputation
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
have
no
sooner
pronounce
his
apology
,
with
a
very
bad
grace
,
than
he
go
away
in
some
disorder
,
and
,
I
dare
say
,
he
will
never
invite
another
Welchman
to
his
table
.
    
<EOS>
We
forthwith
quit
the
field
of
this
atchievement
,
in
order
to
prosecute
our
journey
;
but
we
follow
no
determinate
course
  
<EOS>
We
make
small
deviation
,
to
see
the
remarkable
town
,
villas
,
and
curiosity
on
each
side
of
our
route
;
so
that
we
advance
by
slow
step
towards
the
border
of
Monmouthshire
:
<EOS>
but
in
the
midst
of
these
irregular
motion
,
there
be
no
abberration
nor
eccentricity
in
that
affection
with
which
I
be
,
dear
Wat
,
    
yours
always

<EOS>
dear
DICK
,
<EOS>
at
what
time
of
life
may
a
man
think
himself
exempt
from
the
necessity
of
sacrifice
his
repose
to
the
punctilio
of
a
contemptible
world
?
<EOS>
I
have
be
engage
in
a
ridiculous
adventure
,
which
I
shall
recount
at
meeting
;
and
this
,
I
hope
,
will
not
be
much
longer
delay
,
as
we
have
now
perform
almost
all
our
visit
,
and
see
every
thing
that
I
think
have
any
right
to
retard
us
in
our
journey
homeward
  
<EOS>
a
few
day
ago
,
understanding
by
accident
,
that
my
old
friend
Baynard
be
in
the
country
,
I
would
not
pass
so
near
his
habitation
without
pay
him
a
visit
,
though
our
correspondence
have
be
interrupt
for
a
long
course
of
year
.
    
<EOS>
I
feel
myself
very
sensibly
affect
by
the
idea
of
our
past
intimacy
,
as
we
approach
the
place
where
we
have
spend
so
many
happy
day
together
;
but
when
we
arrive
at
the
house
,
I
could
not
recognize
any
one
of
those
object
,
which
have
be
so
deeply
impressed
upon
my
remembrance
  
<EOS>
the
tall
oak
that
shade
the
avenue
,
have
be
cut
down
,
and
the
iron
gate
at
the
end
of
it
remove
,
together
with
the
high
wall
that
surround
the
court
yard
.
<EOS>
the
house
itself
,
which
be
formerly
a
convent
of
cistercian
monk
,
have
a
venerable
appearance
;
and
along
the
front
that
look
into
the
garden
,
be
a
stone
gallery
,
which
afford
me
many
an
agreeable
walk
,
when
I
be
dispose
to
be
contemplative
  
<EOS>
now
the
old
front
be
cover
with
a
screen
of
modern
architecture
;
so
that
all
without
be
grecian
,
and
all
within
Gothic
  
<EOS>
as
for
the
garden
,
which
be
well
stock
with
the
good
fruit
which
England
could
produce
,
there
be
not
now
the
least
vestige
remaining
of
tree
,
wall
,
or
hedge
  
<EOS>
nothing
appear
but
a
naked
circus
of
loose
sand
,
with
a
dry
bason
and
a
leaden
Triton
in
the
middle
.
    
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
that
Baynard
,
at
his
father
's
death
,
have
a
clear
estate
of
fifteen
hundred
pound
a
-
year
,
and
be
in
other
respect
extremely
well
qualified
to
make
a
respectable
figure
in
the
commonwealth
;
but
,
what
with
some
excess
of
youth
,
and
the
expence
of
a
contest
election
,
he
in
a
few
year
find
himself
encumber
with
a
debt
of
ten
thousand
pound
,
which
he
resolve
to
discharge
by
mean
of
a
prudent
marriage
  
<EOS>
He
accordingly
marry
a
miss
Thompson
,
whose
fortune
amount
to
double
the
sum
that
he
owe
  
<EOS>
She
be
the
daughter
of
a
citizen
,
who
have
fail
in
trade
;
but
her
fortune
come
by
an
uncle
,
who
die
in
the
East
-
Indies
  
Her
own
parent
be
dead
,
she
live
with
a
maiden
aunt
,
who
have
superintend
her
education
;
and
,
in
all
appearance
,
be
well
enough
qualify
for
the
usual
porpose
of
the
married
state
  
<EOS>
Her
virtue
,
however
,
stand
rather
upon
a
negative
;
than
a
positive
foundation
  
<EOS>
She
be
neither
proud
,
insolent
,
nor
capricious
,
nor
give
to
scandal
,
nor
addict
to
gaming
,
nor
incline
to
gallantry
  
She
could
read
,
and
write
,
and
dance
,
and
sing
,
and
play
upon
the
harpsichord
,
and
smatter
French
,
and
take
a
hand
at
whist
and
ombre
;
but
even
these
accomplishment
she
possess
by
half
  
<EOS>
She
excel
in
nothing
.
<EOS>
Her
conversation
be
flat
,
her
stile
mean
,
and
her
expression
embarrass
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
her
character
be
totally
insipid
.
<EOS>
Her
person
be
not
disagreeable
;
but
there
be
nothing
graceful
in
her
address
,
nor
engage
in
her
manner
;
and
she
be
so
ill
qualified
to
do
the
honour
of
the
house
,
that
when
she
sit
at
the
head
of
the
table
,
one
be
always
look
for
the
mistress
of
the
family
in
some
other
place
.
    
<EOS>
Baynard
have
flatter
himself
that
it
would
be
no
difficult
matter
to
mould
such
a
subject
after
his
own
fashion
,
and
that
she
would
chearfully
enter
into
his
view
,
which
be
wholly
turn
to
domestic
happiness
.
<EOS>
He
propose
to
reside
always
in
the
country
,
of
which
he
be
fond
to
a
degree
of
enthusiasm
,
to
cultivate
his
estate
,
which
be
very
improvable
;
to
enjoy
the
exercise
of
rural
diversion
;
to
maintain
an
intimacy
of
correspondence
with
some
friend
that
be
settle
in
his
neighbourhood
;
to
keep
a
comfortable
house
,
without
suffer
his
expence
to
exceed
the
limit
of
his
income
:
and
to
find
pleasure
and
employment
for
his
wife
in
the
management
and
avocation
of
her
own
family
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
a
visionary
scheme
,
which
he
never
be
able
to
realize
.
<EOS>
His
wife
be
as
ignorant
as
a
new
-
bear
babe
of
every
thing
that
relate
to
the
conduct
of
a
family
;
and
she
have
no
idea
of
a
country
life
  
<EOS>
Her
understanding
do
not
reach
so
far
as
to
comprehend
the
first
principle
of
discretion
;
and
,
indeed
,
if
her
capacity
have
be
well
than
it
be
,
her
natural
indolence
would
not
have
permit
her
to
abandon
a
certain
routine
,
to
which
she
have
be
habituate
.
<EOS>
she
have
not
taste
enough
to
relish
any
national
enjoyment
;
but
her
ruile
passion
be
vanity
,
not
that
specie
which
arise
from
self
-
conceit
of
superior
accomplishment
,
but
that
which
be
of
a
bastard
and
idiot
nature
,
excite
by
shew
and
ostentation
,
which
imply
not
even
the
least
consciousness
of
any
personal
merit
.
    
<EOS>
the
nuptial
peale
of
noise
and
nonsense
being
ring
out
in
all
the
usual
change
<EOS>
,
Mr
Baynard
think
it
high
time
to
make
her
acquaint
with
the
particular
of
the
plan
which
he
have
project
  
<EOS>
He
tell
her
that
his
fortune
,
though
sufficient
to
afford
all
the
comfort
of
life
,
be
not
ample
enough
to
command
all
the
superfluity
of
pomp
and
pageantry
,
which
,
indeed
,
be
equally
absurd
and
intolerable
  
<EOS>
He
therefore
hope
she
would
have
no
objection
to
their
leave
London
in
the
spring
,
when
he
would
take
the
opportunity
to
dismiss
some
unnecessary
domestic
,
whom
he
have
hire
for
the
occasion
of
their
marriage
  
<EOS>
She
hear
him
in
silence
,
and
after
some
pause
,
"
<EOS>
so
(
say
she
)
<EOS>
I
be
to
be
bury
in
the
country
!
"
<EOS>
He
be
so
confound
at
this
reply
,
that
he
could
not
speak
for
some
minute
:
at
length
he
tell
her
he
be
much
mortify
to
find
he
have
propose
any
thing
that
be
disagreeable
to
her
idea
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
(
add
he
)
<EOS>
I
mean
nothing
more
than
to
lay
down
a
comfortable
plan
of
live
within
the
bound
of
our
fortune
,
which
be
but
moderate
.
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
(
say
she
)
<EOS>
you
be
the
good
judge
of
your
own
affair
  
<EOS>
My
fortune
,
I
know
,
do
not
exceed
twenty
thousand
pound
  
<EOS>
yet
,
even
with
that
pittance
,
I
may
have
have
a
husband
who
would
not
have
begrudge
me
a
house
in
London
 
"
<EOS>
"
Good
God
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
(
cry
poor
Baynard
,
in
the
utmost
agitation
)
<EOS>
you
do
not
think
me
so
sordid
  
<EOS>
I
only
hint
what
I
think
  
<EOS>
but
,
I
do
not
pretend
to
impose
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
,
(
resume
the
lady
)
<EOS>
it
be
your
prerogative
to
command
,
and
my
duty
to
obey
 
"
    
<EOS>
so
say
,
she
burst
into
tear
and
retire
to
her
chamber
,
where
she
be
join
by
her
aunt
  
<EOS>
He
endeavour
to
recollect
himself
,
and
act
with
vigour
of
mind
on
this
occasion
;
but
be
betray
by
the
tenderness
of
his
nature
,
which
be
the
great
defect
of
his
constitution
.
<EOS>
He
find
the
aunt
in
tear
,
and
the
niece
in
a
fit
,
which
hold
her
the
good
part
of
eight
hour
,
at
the
expiration
of
which
she
begin
to
talk
incoherently
about
death
and
her
dear
husband
,
who
have
sit
by
her
all
this
time
,
and
now
press
her
hand
to
his
lip
,
in
a
transport
of
grief
and
penitance
for
the
offence
he
have
give
  
from
thence
forward
,
he
carefully
avoid
mention
the
country
;
and
they
continue
to
be
suck
deep
and
deep
into
the
vortex
of
extravagance
and
dissipation
,
lead
what
be
call
a
fashionable
life
in
town
  
about
the
latter
end
of
July
,
however
,
Mrs
Baynard
,
in
order
to
exhibit
a
proof
of
conjugal
obedience
,
desire
of
her
own
accord
,
that
they
may
pay
a
visit
to
his
country
house
,
as
there
be
no
company
leave
in
London
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
excuse
himself
from
this
excursion
,
which
be
no
part
of
the
oeconomical
plan
he
have
propose
;
but
she
insist
upon
make
this
sacrifice
to
his
taste
and
prejudice
,
and
away
they
go
with
such
an
equipage
as
astonish
the
whole
country
  
<EOS>
all
that
remain
of
the
season
be
engross
by
receive
and
return
visit
in
the
neighbourhood
;
and
,
in
this
intercourse
,
it
be
discover
that
sir
John
Chickwell
have
a
house
-
steward
and
one
footman
in
livery
more
than
the
complement
of
Mr
Baynard
's
household
.
<EOS>
this
remark
be
make
by
the
aunt
at
table
,
and
assent
to
by
the
husband
,
who
observe
that
sir
John
Chickwell
may
very
well
afford
to
keep
more
servant
than
be
find
in
the
family
of
a
man
who
have
not
half
his
fortune
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Baynard
eat
no
supper
that
evening
;
but
be
seize
with
a
violent
fit
which
complete
her
triumph
over
the
spirit
of
her
consort
.
<EOS>
the
two
supernumerary
servant
be
add
  
the
family
plate
be
sell
for
old
silver
,
and
a
new
service
procure
;
fashionable
furniture
be
provide
,
and
the
whole
house
turn
topsy
turvy
.
    
<EOS>
at
their
return
to
London
,
in
the
beginning
of
winter
,
he
,
with
a
heavy
heart
,
communicate
these
particular
to
me
in
confidence
.
<EOS>
before
his
marriage
,
he
have
introduce
me
to
the
lady
as
his
particular
friend
;
and
I
now
offer
in
that
character
,
to
lay
before
her
the
necessity
of
reform
her
oeconomy
,
if
she
have
any
regard
to
the
interest
of
her
own
family
,
or
complaisance
for
the
inclination
of
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
but
Baynard
decline
my
offer
,
on
the
supposition
that
his
wife
's
nerve
be
to
delicate
to
bear
expostulation
;
and
that
it
would
only
serve
to
overwhelm
her
with
such
distress
as
would
make
himself
miserable
.
<EOS>
Baynard
be
a
man
of
spirit
,
and
have
she
prove
a
termagant
,
he
would
have
know
how
to
deal
with
her
;
but
either
by
accident
or
instinct
,
she
fasten
upon
the
weak
side
of
his
soul
,
and
hold
it
so
fast
,
that
he
have
be
in
subjection
ever
since
  
I
afterwards
advise
him
to
carry
her
abroad
to
France
or
Italy
,
where
he
may
gratify
her
vanity
for
half
the
expence
it
cost
him
in
England
;
and
this
advice
he
follow
accordingly
  
<EOS>
She
be
agreeably
flatter
with
the
idea
of
see
and
know
foreign
part
,
and
foreign
fashion
;
of
be
present
to
sovereign
,
and
live
familiarly
with
prince
.
<EOS>
She
forthwith
seize
the
hint
which
I
have
throw
out
on
purpose
,
and
even
press
Mr
Baynard
to
hasten
his
departure
;
so
that
in
a
few
week
they
cross
the
sea
to
France
,
with
a
moderate
train
,
<EOS>
still
include
the
aunt
;
who
be
her
bosom
counsellor
,
and
abet
her
in
all
her
opposition
to
her
husband
's
<EOS>
will
  
<EOS>
since
that
period
,
I
have
have
little
or
no
opportunity
to
renew
our
former
correspondence
  
all
that
I
know
of
his
transaction
,
amount
to
no
more
than
that
after
an
absence
of
two
year
,
they
return
so
little
improved
in
oeconomy
,
that
they
launch
out
into
a
new
ocean
of
extravagance
,
which
,
at
length
,
oblige
him
to
mortgage
his
estate
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
she
have
bear
him
three
child
,
of
which
the
last
only
survive
,
a
puny
boy
of
twelve
or
thirteen
,
who
will
be
ruin
in
his
education
by
the
indulgence
of
his
mother
.
    
<EOS>
as
for
Baynard
,
neither
his
own
good
sense
,
nor
the
dread
of
indigence
,
nor
the
consideration
of
his
child
,
have
be
of
force
sufficient
to
stimulate
him
into
the
resolution
of
break
at
once
the
shameful
spell
by
which
he
seem
enchant
  
with
a
taste
capable
of
the
most
refined
enjoyment
,
a
heart
glow
with
all
the
warmth
of
friendship
and
humanity
,
and
<EOS>
a
disposition
strongly
turn
to
the
more
rational
pleasure
of
a
retired
and
country
life
,
he
be
hurried
about
in
a
perpetual
tumult
,
amidst
a
mob
of
being
please
with
rattle
,
bauble
,
and
gew
-
gaw
,
so
void
of
sense
and
distinction
,
that
even
the
most
acute
philosophy
would
find
it
a
very
hard
task
to
discover
for
what
wise
purpose
of
providence
they
be
create
  
<EOS>
friendship
be
not
to
be
find
;
nor
can
the
amusement
for
which
he
sigh
be
enjoy
within
the
rotation
of
absurdity
,
to
which
he
be
doom
for
life
.
<EOS>
He
have
long
resign
all
view
of
improve
his
fortune
by
management
and
attention
to
the
exercise
of
husbandry
,
in
which
he
delight
;
and
as
to
domestic
happiness
,
not
the
least
glimpse
of
hope
remain
to
amuse
his
imagination
.
<EOS>
thus
blast
in
all
his
prospect
,
he
could
not
fail
to
be
overwhelm
with
melancholy
and
chagrin
,
which
have
prey
upon
his
health
and
spirit
in
such
a
manner
,
that
he
be
now
threaten
with
a
consumption
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
give
you
a
sketch
of
the
man
,
whom
the
other
day
I
go
to
visit
  
<EOS>
at
the
gate
we
find
a
great
number
of
powder
lacquie
,
but
no
civility
  
<EOS>
after
we
have
sit
a
considerable
time
in
the
coach
,
we
be
tell
,
that
Mr
Baynard
have
ride
out
,
and
that
his
lady
be
dress
;
but
we
be
introduce
to
a
parlour
,
so
very
fine
and
delicate
,
that
in
all
appearance
it
be
design
to
be
see
only
,
not
inhabit
.
<EOS>
the
chair
and
couch
be
carve
,
gilt
,
and
cover
with
rich
damask
,
so
smooth
and
sleek
,
that
they
look
as
if
they
have
never
be
sit
upon
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
carpet
on
the
floor
;
but
the
board
be
rub
and
wax
in
such
a
manner
,
that
we
could
not
walk
,
but
be
oblige
to
slide
along
them
;
and
as
for
the
stove
,
it
be
too
bright
and
polished
to
be
pollute
with
sea
-
coal
,
or
stain
by
the
smoke
of
any
gross
material
fire
  
<EOS>
when
we
have
remain
above
half
an
hour
sacrifice
to
the
inhospitable
power
in
this
temple
of
cold
reception
,
my
friend
Baynard
arrive
,
and
understanding
we
be
in
the
house
,
make
his
appearance
,
so
meagre
,
yellow
,
and
deject
that
I
really
should
not
have
know
him
,
have
I
meet
with
him
in
any
other
place
  
run
up
to
me
,
with
great
eagerness
,
he
strain
me
in
his
embrace
,
and
his
heart
be
so
full
,
that
for
some
minute
he
could
not
speak
  
have
salute
us
all
round
,
he
perceive
our
uncomfortable
situation
,
and
conduct
us
into
another
apartment
,
which
have
fire
in
the
chimney
,
call
for
chocolate
  
<EOS>
then
,
withdraw
,
he
return
with
a
compliment
from
his
wife
,
and
,
in
the
mean
time
,
present
his
son
Harry
,
a
shambling
,
blear
-
eyed
boy
,
in
the
habit
of
a
hussar
;
very
rude
,
forward
,
and
impertinent
  
His
father
would
have
send
him
to
a
boarding
-
school
,
but
his
mamma
and
aunt
would
not
hear
of
his
lie
out
of
the
house
;
so
that
there
be
a
clergyman
engage
as
his
tutor
in
the
family
.
    
<EOS>
as
it
be
but
just
turn
of
twelve
,
and
the
whole
house
be
in
commotion
to
prepare
a
formal
entertainment
,
I
forsaw
it
would
be
late
before
we
dine
,
and
propse
a
walk
to
Mr
Baynard
,
that
we
may
converse
together
freely
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
the
perambulation
,
when
I
express
some
surprise
that
he
have
return
so
soon
from
Italy
,
he
give
me
to
understand
,
that
his
go
abroad
have
not
at
all
answer
the
purpose
for
which
he
leave
England
;
that
although
the
expence
of
living
be
not
so
great
in
Italy
as
at
home
,
respect
be
have
to
the
same
rank
of
life
in
both
country
,
it
have
be
find
necessary
for
him
to
lift
himself
above
his
usual
stile
,
that
he
may
be
on
some
footing
with
the
count
,
marquise
,
and
cavaliere
,
with
whom
he
keep
company
  
<EOS>
He
be
oblige
to
hire
a
great
number
of
servant
,
to
take
off
a
great
variety
of
rich
cloath
,
and
to
keep
a
sumptuous
table
for
the
fashionable
scorocconi
of
the
country
;
who
,
without
a
consideration
of
this
kind
,
would
not
have
pay
any
attention
to
an
untitled
foreigner
,
let
his
family
or
fortune
be
ever
so
respectable
  
<EOS>
besides
,
Mrs
Baynard
be
continually
surround
by
a
train
of
expensive
lounger
,
under
the
denomination
of
language
-
master
,
musician
,
painter
,
and
ciceroni
;
and
have
actually
fall
into
the
disease
of
buy
picture
and
antique
upon
her
own
judgment
,
which
be
far
from
be
infallible
  
<EOS>
at
length
she
meet
with
an
affront
,
which
give
her
a
disgust
to
Italy
,
and
drive
her
back
to
England
with
some
precipitation
.
<EOS>
by
mean
of
frequent
the
dutchess
of
b

's
conversazione
,
while
her
grace
be
at
Rome
Mrs
Baynard
become
acquaint
with
all
the
fashionable
people
of
that
city
,
and
be
admit
to
their
assembly
without
scruple
  
<EOS>
thus
favour
,
she
conceive
too
great
an
idea
of
her
own
importance
,
and
when
the
dutchess
leave
Rome
,
resolve
to
have
a
conversazione
that
should
leave
the
Romans
no
room
to
regret
her
grace
's
departure
.
<EOS>
She
provide
hand
for
a
musical
entertainment
,
and
send
bighetti
of
invitation
to
every
person
of
distinction
;
but
not
one
roman
of
the
female
sex
appear
at
her
assembly
  
<EOS>
She
be
that
night
seize
with
a
violent
fit
,
and
keep
her
bed
three
day
,
<EOS>
at
the
expiration
of
which
she
declare
that
the
air
of
Italy
would
be
the
ruin
of
her
constitution
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
prevent
this
catastrophe
,
she
be
speedily
remove
to
Geneva
,
from
whence
they
return
to
England
by
the
way
of
Lyons
and
Paris
.
<EOS>
by
the
time
they
arrive
at
Calais
,
she
have
purchase
such
a
quantity
of
silk
,
stuff
,
and
lace
,
that
it
be
necessary
to
hire
a
vessel
to
smuggle
them
over
,
and
this
vessel
be
take
by
a
custom
-
house
cutter
;
so
that
they
lose
the
whole
cargo
,
which
have
cost
them
above
eight
hundred
pound
.
    
<EOS>
It
now
appear
,
that
her
travel
have
produce
no
effect
upon
her
,
but
that
of
make
her
more
expensive
and
fantastic
than
ever
:
  
She
affect
to
lead
the
fashion
,
not
only
in
point
of
female
dress
,
but
in
every
article
of
taste
and
connoisseurship
.
<EOS>
She
make
a
drawing
of
the
new
facade
to
the
house
in
the
country
;
she
pull
up
the
tree
,
and
pull
down
the
wall
of
the
garden
,
so
as
to
let
in
the
easterly
wind
,
which
Mr
Baynard
's
ancestor
have
be
at
great
pain
to
exclude
.
<EOS>
to
shew
her
taste
in
lay
out
ground
,
she
seize
in
-
into
her
own
hand
a
farm
of
two
hundred
acre
,
about
a
mile
from
the
house
,
which
she
parcel
out
into
walk
and
shrubbery
,
have
a
great
bason
in
the
middle
,
into
which
she
pour
a
whole
stream
that
turn
two
mill
,
and
afford
the
good
trout
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
the
bottom
of
the
bason
,
however
,
be
so
ill
secure
,
that
it
would
not
hold
the
water
which
strain
through
the
earth
,
and
make
a
bog
of
the
whole
plantation
:
in
a
word
,
the
ground
,
which
formerly
pay
him
one
hundred
and
fifty
pound
a
year
,
now
cost
him
two
hundred
pound
a
year
to
keep
in
it
tolerable
order
,
over
and
above
the
first
expence
of
tree
,
shrub
,
flower
,
turf
,
and
gravel
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
an
inch
of
garden
ground
leave
about
the
house
,
nor
a
tree
that
produce
fruit
of
any
kind
;
nor
do
he
raise
a
truss
of
hay
,
or
a
bushel
of
oats
for
his
horse
,
nor
have
he
a
single
cow
to
afford
him
milk
for
his
tea
;
far
less
do
he
ever
dream
of
feed
his
own
mutton
,
pig
,
and
poultry
:
every
article
of
house
-
keep
,
even
the
most
inconsiderable
,
be
bring
from
the
next
market
town
,
at
the
distance
of
five
mile
,
and
<EOS>
thither
they
send
a
courier
every
morning
to
fetch
hot
roll
for
breakfast
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
Baynard
fairly
own
that
he
spend
double
his
income
,
and
that
in
a
few
year
he
should
be
oblige
to
sell
his
estate
for
the
payment
of
his
creditor
.
<EOS>
He
say
his
wife
have
such
delicate
nerve
,
and
such
imbecility
of
spirit
,
that
she
could
neither
bear
remonstrance
,
be
it
ever
so
gentle
,
nor
practise
any
scheme
of
retrenchment
,
even
if
she
perceive
the
necessity
of
such
a
measure
.
<EOS>
He
have
therefore
cease
struggle
against
the
stream
,
and
endeavour
to
reconcile
himself
to
ruin
,
by
reflect
that
his
child
,
at
least
,
would
inherit
his
mother
's
fortune
,
which
be
secure
to
him
by
the
contract
of
marriage
.
    
<EOS>
the
detail
which
he
give
me
of
his
affair
,
fill
me
at
once
with
grief
and
indignation
.
<EOS>
I
inveigh
bitterly
against
the
indiscretion
of
his
wife
,
and
reproach
him
with
his
unmanly
acquiescence
under
the
absurd
tyranny
which
she
exert
.
<EOS>
I
exhort
him
to
recollect
his
resolution
,
and
make
one
effectual
effort
to
disengage
himself
from
a
thraldom
,
equally
shameful
and
pernicious
.
<EOS>
I
offer
him
all
the
assistance
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
I
undertake
to
regulate
his
affair
,
and
even
to
bring
about
a
reformation
in
his
family
,
if
he
would
only
authorise
me
to
execute
the
plan
I
should
form
for
his
advantage
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
effect
by
the
subject
,
that
I
could
not
help
mingle
tear
with
my
remonstrance
,
and
Baynard
be
so
penetrate
with
these
mark
of
my
affection
,
that
he
lose
all
power
of
utterance
.
<EOS>
He
press
me
to
his
breast
with
great
emotion
.
<EOS>
and
weep
in
silence
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
exclaim
,
"
friendship
be
undoubtedly
the
most
precious
balm
of
life
!
<EOS>
Your
word
,
dear
bramble
,
have
in
a
great
measure
recall
me
from
an
abyss
of
despondence
,
in
which
I
have
be
long
overwhelmed
  
<EOS>
I
will
,
upon
honour
,
make
you
acquaint
with
a
distinct
state
of
my
affair
,
and
,
as
far
as
I
be
able
to
go
will
follow
the
course
you
prescribe
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
certain
length
which
my
nature
  
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
there
be
tender
connexion
,
of
which
a
batchelor
have
no
idea
  
<EOS>
Shall
I
own
my
weakness
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
the
thought
of
make
that
woman
uneasy
 
"
<EOS>
"
and
yet
,
(
cry
I
)
<EOS>
she
have
see
you
unhappy
for
a
series
of
year
 
unhappy
from
her
misconduct
,
without
ever
shew
the
least
inclination
to
alleviate
your
distress
 
"
"
nevertheless
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
I
be
persuade
she
love
me
with
the
most
warm
affection
;
but
these
be
incongruity
in
the
composition
of
the
human
mind
which
I
hold
to
be
inexplicable
.
"
    
<EOS>
I
be
shock
at
his
infatuation
,
and
change
the
subject
,
after
we
have
agree
to
maintain
a
close
correspondence
for
the
future
  
<EOS>
He
then
give
me
to
understand
,
that
he
have
two
neighbour
,
who
,
like
himself
,
be
drive
by
their
wife
at
full
speed
,
in
the
high
road
to
bankruptcy
and
ruin
.
<EOS>
all
the
three
husband
be
of
disposition
very
different
from
each
other
,
and
,
accord
to
this
variation
,
their
consort
be
admirably
suited
to
the
purpose
of
keep
them
all
three
in
subjection
.
<EOS>
the
view
of
the
lady
be
exactly
the
same
.
<EOS>
They
vie
in
grandeur
,
that
is
,
in
ostentation
,
with
the
wife
of
Sir
Charles
Chickwell
,
who
have
four
time
their
fortune
;
and
she
again
pique
herself
upon
make
an
equal
figure
with
a
neighbouring
peeress
,
whose
revenue
treble
her
own
.
<EOS>
here
then
be
the
fable
of
the
frog
and
the
ox
,
realize
in
four
different
instance
within
the
same
county
:
<EOS>
one
large
fortune
,
and
three
moderate
estate
,
in
a
fair
way
of
be
burst
by
the
inflamation
of
female
vanity
;
and
in
three
of
these
instance
,
three
different
form
of
female
tyranny
be
exercise
.
<EOS>
Mr
Baynard
be
subjugate
by
practise
upon
the
tenderness
of
his
nature
.
<EOS>
Mr
Milksan
,
be
of
a
timorous
disposition
,
truckle
to
the
insolence
of
a
termagant
.
<EOS>
Mr
Sowerby
,
who
be
of
a
temper
neither
to
be
move
by
fit
,
nor
drive
by
menace
,
have
the
fortune
to
be
fit
with
a
helpmate
,
who
assail
him
with
the
weapon
of
irony
and
satire
;
sometimes
sneer
in
the
way
of
compliment
;
sometimes
throw
out
sarcastic
comparison
,
imply
reproach
upon
his
want
of
taste
,
spirit
,
and
generosity
:
by
which
mean
she
stimulate
his
passion
from
one
act
of
extravagance
to
another
,
just
as
the
circumstance
of
her
vanity
require
.
    
<EOS>
all
these
three
lady
have
at
this
time
the
same
number
of
horse
,
carriage
,
and
servant
in
and
out
of
livery
;
the
same
variety
of
dress
;
the
same
quantity
of
plate
and
china
;
the
like
ornament
in
furniture
;
and
in
their
entertainment
they
endeavour
to
exceed
one
another
in
the
variety
,
delicacy
,
and
expence
of
their
dish
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
will
be
find
upon
enquiry
,
that
nineteen
out
of
twenty
,
who
be
ruin
by
extravagance
,
fall
a
sacrifice
to
the
ridiculous
pride
and
vanity
of
silly
woman
,
whose
part
be
hold
in
contempt
by
the
very
man
whom
they
pillage
and
enslave
.
<EOS>
thank
heaven
,
Dick
,
that
among
all
the
folly
,
and
weakness
of
human
nature
,
I
have
not
yet
fall
into
that
of
matrimony
.
    
<EOS>
after
Baynard
<EOS>
and
I
have
discuss
all
these
matter
at
leisure
,
we
return
towards
the
house
,
and
meet
Jery
with
our
two
woman
,
who
have
come
forth
to
take
the
air
,
as
the
lady
of
the
mansion
have
not
yet
make
her
appearance
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
Mrs
Baynard
do
not
produce
herself
,
till
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
dinner
be
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
then
her
husband
bring
her
into
the
parlour
,
accompany
by
her
aunt
and
son
,
and
she
receive
us
with
a
coldness
of
reserve
sufficient
to
freeze
the
very
soul
of
hospitality
.
<EOS>
though
she
know
I
have
be
the
intimate
friend
of
her
husband
,
and
have
often
see
me
with
him
in
London
,
she
shew
no
mark
of
recognition
or
regard
,
when
I
address
myself
to
her
in
the
most
friendly
term
of
salutation
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
even
express
the
common
complement
of
,
I
be
glad
to
see
you
:
or
,
I
hope
you
have
enjoy
your
health
since
we
have
the
pleasure
of
see
you
;
or
some
such
word
of
course
:
nor
do
she
once
open
her
mouth
in
the
way
of
welcome
to
my
sister
and
my
niece
:
but
sit
in
silence
like
a
statue
,
with
an
aspect
of
insensibility
.
<EOS>
Her
aunt
,
the
model
upon
which
she
have
be
form
,
be
indeed
the
very
essence
of
insipid
formality
:
but
the
boy
be
very
pert
and
impudent
,
and
prate
without
cease
.
    
<EOS>
at
dinner
,
the
lady
maintain
the
same
ungracious
indifference
,
never
speak
but
in
whisper
to
her
aunt
?
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
repast
,
it
be
make
up
of
a
parcel
of
kickshaw
,
contrive
by
a
Frence
cook
,
without
one
substantial
article
adapt
to
the
satisfaction
of
an
english
appetite
.
<EOS>
the
pottage
be
little
well
than
bread
soak
in
dish
-
washing
,
lukewarm
.
<EOS>
the
ragout
look
as
if
they
have
be
once
eat
and
half
digested
:
the
fricassee
be
involve
in
a
nasty
yellow
poultice
;
and
the
rotis
be
scorch
and
stink
,
for
the
honour
of
the
fumet
.
<EOS>
the
desert
consist
of
fade
fruit
and
ice
froth
,
a
good
emblem
of
our
landlady
's
character
;
the
table
-
beer
be
sour
,
the
water
foul
,
and
the
wine
vapid
;
but
there
be
a
parade
of
plate
and
china
,
and
a
powdered
lacquey
stand
behind
every
chair
,
except
those
of
the
master
and
mistress
of
the
house
,
who
be
serve
by
two
valet
dress
like
gentleman
.
<EOS>
We
dine
in
a
large
old
gothic
parlour
,
which
be
formerly
the
hall
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
pave
with
marble
,
and
,
notwithstanding
the
fire
,
which
have
be
kindle
about
an
hour
,
strike
me
with
such
a
chill
sensation
,
that
when
I
enter
it
the
tooth
chatter
in
my
jaw
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
every
thing
be
cold
,
comfortless
and
disgusting
,
except
the
look
of
my
friend
Baynard
,
which
declare
the
warmth
of
his
affection
and
humanity
.
    
<EOS>
after
dinner
we
withdraw
into
another
apartment
,
where
the
boy
begin
to
be
impertinently
troublesome
to
my
niece
Liddy
.
<EOS>
He
want
a
play
-
fellow
,
forsooth
;
and
would
have
romp
with
her
,
<EOS>
have
she
encourage
his
advance
  
<EOS>
He
be
even
so
impudent
as
to
snatch
a
kiss
,
at
which
she
change
countenance
,
and
seem
uneasy
;
and
though
his
father
check
him
for
the
rudeness
of
his
behaviour
,
he
become
so
outrageous
as
to
thrust
his
hand
in
her
bosom
:
an
insult
to
which
she
do
not
tamely
submit
,
though
one
of
the
mild
creature
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
sparkle
with
resentment
,
she
start
up
,
and
lend
him
such
a
box
in
the
ear
,
as
send
him
staggering
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
.
    
<EOS>
"
Miss
Melford
,
(
cry
his
father
)
<EOS>
you
have
treat
him
with
the
utmost
propriety
  
<EOS>
I
be
only
sorry
that
the
impertinence
of
any
child
of
mine
should
have
occasion
this
exertion
of
your
spirit
,
which
I
can
not
but
applaud
and
admire
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
wife
be
so
far
from
assent
to
the
candour
of
his
apology
,
that
she
rise
from
table
,
and
,
take
her
son
by
the
hand
,
"
come
,
child
,
(
<EOS>
say
she
)
<EOS>
your
father
can
not
abide
you
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
she
retire
with
this
hopeful
youth
,
and
be
follow
by
her
gouvernante
:
<EOS>
but
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
deign
to
take
the
least
notice
of
the
company
.
    
<EOS>
Baynard
be
exceedingly
disconcert
;
but
I
perceive
his
uneasiness
be
tincture
with
resentment
,
and
derive
a
good
oman
from
this
discovery
.
<EOS>
I
order
the
horse
to
be
put
to
the
carriage
,
and
,
though
he
make
some
effort
to
detain
us
all
night
,
I
insist
upon
leave
the
house
immediately
;
but
,
before
I
go
away
,
I
take
an
opportunity
of
speak
to
him
again
in
private
.
<EOS>
I
say
every
thing
I
could
recollect
,
to
animate
his
endeavour
in
shake
off
those
shameful
trammel
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
scruple
to
declare
,
that
his
wife
be
unworthy
of
that
tender
complaisance
which
he
have
shew
for
her
foible
:
that
she
be
dead
to
all
the
genuine
sentiment
of
conjugal
affection
;
insensible
of
her
own
honour
and
interest
,
and
seemingly
destitute
of
common
sense
and
reflection
,
I
conjure
him
to
remember
what
he
owe
to
his
father
's
house
,
to
his
own
reputation
,
and
to
his
family
,
include
even
this
unreasonable
woman
herself
,
who
be
drive
on
blindly
to
her
own
destruction
.
<EOS>
I
advise
him
to
form
a
plan
for
retrench
superfluous
expence
,
and
try
to
convince
the
aunt
of
the
necessity
for
such
a
reformation
,
that
she
may
gradually
prepare
her
niece
for
its
execution
;
and
I
exhort
him
to
turn
that
disagreeable
piece
of
formality
out
of
the
house
,
if
he
should
find
her
averse
to
his
proposal
.
    
<EOS>
here
he
interrupt
me
with
a
sigh
,
observe
that
such
a
step
would
undoubtedly
be
fatal
to
Mrs
Baynard
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
lose
all
patience
(
cry
I
)
to
hear
you
talk
so
weakly
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Baynard
's
fit
will
never
hurt
her
constitution
.
<EOS>
I
believe
in
my
conscience
they
be
all
affected
:
I
be
sure
she
have
no
feeling
for
your
distress
;
and
,
when
you
be
ruin
,
she
will
appear
to
have
no
feeling
for
her
own
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
finally
,
I
take
his
word
and
honour
,
that
he
would
make
an
effort
,
such
as
I
have
advise
;
that
he
would
form
a
plan
of
oeconomy
,
and
,
if
he
find
it
impracticable
without
my
assistance
,
he
would
come
to
Bath
in
the
winter
,
where
I
promise
to
give
him
the
meeting
,
and
contribute
all
in
my
power
to
the
retrieval
of
his
affair
  
with
this
mutual
engagement
we
part
;
and
I
shall
think
myself
supremely
happy
,
if
,
by
my
mean
,
a
worthy
man
,
whom
I
love
and
esteem
,
can
be
save
from
misery
,
disgrace
and
despair
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
only
one
friend
more
to
visit
in
this
part
of
the
country
,
but
he
be
of
a
complexion
very
different
from
that
of
Baynard
.
<EOS>
You
have
hear
memention
Sir
Thomas
Bullford
,
whom
I
know
in
Italy
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
become
a
country
gentleman
;
but
,
be
disable
by
the
gout
from
enjoy
any
amusement
abroad
,
he
entertain
himself
within
door
,
by
keep
open
house
for
all
comer
,
and
play
upon
the
oddity
and
humour
of
his
company
:
but
he
himself
be
generally
the
great
original
at
his
table
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
good
-
humour
,
talk
much
,
and
laugh
without
cease
.
<EOS>
I
be
tell
that
all
the
use
he
make
of
his
understanding
at
present
,
be
to
excite
mirth
,
by
exhibit
his
guest
in
ludicrous
attitude
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
far
we
may
furnish
him
with
entertainment
of
this
kind
,
but
I
be
resolve
to
beat
up
his
quarter
,
partly
with
a
view
to
laugh
with
the
knight
himself
,
and
partly
to
pay
my
respect
to
his
lady
,
a
good
-
natured
sensible
woman
,
with
whom
he
live
upon
very
easy
term
,
although
she
have
not
have
the
good
fortune
to
bring
him
an
heir
to
his
estate
.
    
<EOS>
and
now
,
dear
Dick
,
I
must
tell
you
for
your
comfort
,
that
you
be
the
only
man
upon
earth
to
whom
I
would
presume
to
send
such
a
long
-
winded
epistle
,
which
I
could
not
find
in
my
heart
to
curtail
,
because
the
subject
interest
the
warm
passion
of
my
heart
;
neither
will
I
make
any
other
apology
to
a
corespondent
who
have
be
so
long
accustomed
to
the
impertinence

to
Sir

Oxon
,
    
DEAR
KNIGHT
,
I
believe
,
there
be
something
mischievous
in
my
disposition
,
for
nothing
divert
me
so
much
as
to
see
certain
character
torment
with
false
terror
.
  
<EOS>
We
last
night
lodge
at
the
house
of
sir
Thomas
Bullford
,
an
old
friend
of
my
uncle
,
a
jolly
fellow
,
of
moderate
intellect
,
who
,
in
spite
of
the
gout
,
which
have
lame
him
,
be
resolve
to
be
merry
to
the
last
;
and
mirth
he
have
a
particular
nack
in
extract
from
his
guest
,
let
their
humour
be
never
so
caustic
or
refractory
.
  
<EOS>
besides
our
company
,
there
be
in
the
house
a
fat
-
headed
justice
of
the
peace
,
call
Frogmore
,
and
a
country
practioner
in
surgery
,
who
seem
to
be
our
landlord
's
chief
companion
and
confidant
.
  
<EOS>
We
find
the
knight
sit
on
a
couch
,
with
his
cruche
by
his
side
,
and
his
foot
support
on
cushion
;
but
he
receive
us
with
a
hearty
welcome
,
and
seem
greatly
rejoice
at
our
arrival
.
  
<EOS>
after
tea
we
be
entertain
with
a
sonata
on
the
harpsichord
by
lady
Bullford
,
who
sing
and
play
to
admiration
;
but
sir
Thomas
seem
to
be
a
little
asinine
in
the
article
of
ear
,
though
he
affect
to
be
in
rapture
;
and
beg
his
wife
to
favour
us
with
an
arietta
of
her
own
composing
.
  
<EOS>
this
arietta
,
however
,
she
no
sooner
begin
to
perform
,
than
he
and
the
justice
fall
asleep
;
but
the
moment
she
cease
play
,
the
knight
wake
snorting
,
and
exclaim
,
"
o
cara
!
<EOS>
what
d'ye
think
,
gentleman
?
<EOS>
Will
you
talk
any
more
of
your
pargolesi
and
your
corelli
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
he
thrust
his
tongue
in
one
cheek
,
and
leer
with
one
eye
at
the
doctor
and
me
,
who
sit
on
his
left
hand
.
  
<EOS>
He
conclude
the
pantomime
with
a
loud
laugh
,
which
he
could
command
at
all
time
extempore
.
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
his
disorder
,
he
do
not
do
penance
at
supper
,
nor
do
he
ever
refuse
his
glass
when
the
toast
go
round
,
but
rather
encourage
a
quick
circulation
,
both
by
precept
and
example
.
    
<EOS>
I
soon
perceive
the
doctor
have
make
himself
very
necessary
to
the
baronet
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
the
whetstone
of
his
wit
,
the
but
of
his
satire
,
and
his
operator
in
certain
experiment
of
humour
,
which
be
occasionally
try
upon
stranger
  
<EOS>
Justice
Frogmore
be
an
excellent
subject
for
this
species
of
philosophy
;
sleek
and
corpulent
,
solemn
and
shallow
,
he
have
study
Burn
with
uncommon
application
,
but
he
study
nothing
so
much
as
the
art
of
living
(
that
is
,
eat
)
well
.
  
<EOS>
this
fat
buck
have
often
offorde
good
sport
to
our
landlord
;
and
he
be
frequently
start
with
tolerable
success
,
in
the
course
of
this
evening
;
but
the
baronet
's
appetite
for
redicule
seem
to
be
chiefly
exit
by
the
appearance
,
address
,
and
conversation
of
Lismahago
,
whom
he
attempt
in
all
the
different
mode
of
exposition
;
but
he
put
me
in
mind
of
a
contest
that
I
once
see
betwixt
a
young
hound
and
and
old
hedge
-
hog
  
<EOS>
the
dog
turn
him
over
and
over
,
and
bounce
,
and
bark
,
and
mumble
;
but
as
often
as
he
attempt
to
bite
,
he
feel
a
prickle
in
his
jaw
,
and
recoil
in
manifest
confusion
:
  
<EOS>
the
captain
,
when
leave
to
himself
,
will
not
fail
to
turn
his
ludicrous
side
to
the
company
,
but
if
any
man
attempt
to
force
him
into
that
attitude
,
he
become
stubborn
as
a
mule
,
and
unmanageable
as
an
elephant
unbroke
.
    
<EOS>
Divers
tolerable
joke
be
crack
upon
the
justice
who
eat
a
most
unconscionable
supper
,
and
,
among
other
thing
,
a
large
plate
of
broil
mushroom
,
which
he
have
no
sooner
swallow
than
the
doctor
observe
,
with
great
gravity
,
that
they
be
of
the
kind
call
champignon
,
which
in
some
constitution
have
a
poisonous
effect
  
Mr
Frogmore
,
startle
at
this
remark
,
ask
,
in
some
confusion
,
why
he
have
not
be
so
kind
as
to
give
him
that
notice
sooner
.
  
<EOS>
He
answer
,
that
he
take
it
for
grant
,
by
his
eat
them
so
heartily
,
that
he
be
use
to
the
dish
;
but
as
he
seem
to
be
under
some
apprehension
,
he
prescribe
a
bumper
of
plague
water
,
which
the
justice
drink
off
immediately
,
and
retire
to
rest
,
not
without
mark
of
terror
and
disquiet
.
    
<EOS>
at
midnight
we
be
shew
to
our
different
chamber
,
and
in
half
an
hour
,
I
be
fast
asleep
in
bed
;
but
about
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
<EOS>
I
be
wake
with
a
dismal
cry
of
fire
!
<EOS>
and
start
up
,
run
to
the
window
in
my
shirt
.
  
<EOS>
the
night
be
dark
and
stormy
;
and
a
number
of
people
half
-
dress
run
backwards
and
forwards
thro
'
the
court
-
yard
,
with
link
and
lantern
,
seemingly
in
the
utmost
hurry
and
trepidation
.
  
<EOS>
slip
on
my
cloath
in
a
twinkling
,
I
run
down
stair
,
and
,
upon
inquiry
,
find
the
fire
be
confine
to
a
backstair
,
which
lead
to
a
detached
apartment
where
Lismahago
lie
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
the
lieutenant
be
alarm
by
a
bawling
at
his
window
,
which
be
in
the
second
story
,
but
he
could
not
find
his
cloath
in
the
dark
,
and
his
room
-
door
be
lock
on
the
outside
  
the
servant
call
to
him
,
that
the
house
have
be
rob
;
that
,
without
all
doubt
,
the
villians
have
take
away
his
cloath
,
fasten
the
door
,
and
set
the
house
on
fire
,
for
the
staircase
be
in
flame
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
dilemma
the
poor
lieutenant
run
about
the
room
naked
like
a
squirrel
in
a
cage
,
pop
out
his
head
at
the
window
between
while

and
imploring
assistance
.

at

Sir
Thomas

already

his
people
to

a
long
ladder
,
which
be
apply
to
the
captain
's
window
and
now
he
exhort
him
earnestly
to
descend
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
need
of
much
rhetoric
to
persuade
Lismahago
,
who
forthwith
make
his
exit
by
the
window
,
roar
all
the
time
to
the
people
below
to
hold
fast
the
ladder

<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
gravity
of
the
occasion

scene

a
fitter
subject
for
ridicule
than
the
knight
himself

that
she
be
very
much
afraid

he
would
very
soon
find

the

a
Goth

a
barbarian

if
he
do
not
enter
into
the
spirit

such
a

humorous
contrivance

He
beg
,
however

Mr

bring
him
to
reason

this

read
the

appeased

find
he
have
contribute
to
the
diversion
of
the
company
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
shake
him
by
the
hand
,
laugh
heartily
;
and
then
desire
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
in
token
of
perfect
reconciliation
.
  
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
,
put
his
hand
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
pull
out
,
instead
of
his
own
Scotch
mull
,
a
very
fine
gold
snuff
box
,
which
he
no
sooner
perceive
than
he
say
,
"
here
be
a
small
mistake
.
"
<EOS>
"
no
mistake
at
all
(
cry
the
baronet
)
:
a
fair
exchange
be
no
robbery
.
  
<EOS>
oblige
me
so
far
,
captain
,
as
to
let
me
keep
your
mull
as
a
memorial
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
(
say
the
lieutenant
)
<EOS>
the
mull
be
much
at
your
service
;
but
this
machine
I
can
by
no
means
retain
.
  
<EOS>
It
look
like
compound
a
sort
of
felony
in
the
code
of
honour
.
  
<EOS>
besides
,
I
do
not
know
<EOS>
but
there
may
be
another
joke
in
this
conveyance
;
and
I
do
not
find
myself
disposed
to
be
bring
upon
the
stage
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
presume
to
make
free
with
your
pocket
,
but
I
beg
you
will
put
it
up
again
with
your
own
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
say
,
with
a
certain
austerity
of
aspect
,
he
present
the
snuff
-
box
to
the
knight
,
who
receive
it
in
some
confusion
,
and
restore
the
mull
,
which
he
would
by
no
means
keep
,
except
on
the
term
of
exchange
.
    
<EOS>
this
transaction
be
like
to
give
a
grave
cast
to
the
conversation
,
when
my
uncle
take
notice
that
Mr
Justice
Frogmore
have
not
make
his
appearance
either
at
the
night
-
alarm
,
or
now
at
the
general
rendezvous
.
  
<EOS>
the
baronet
hear
Frogmore
mention
,
"
odso
!
<EOS>
(
cry
he
)
<EOS>
I
have
forget
the
justice
.
  
<EOS>
Pr'ythee
,
doctor
,
go
and
bring
him
out
of
his
kennel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
laugh
till
his
side
be
well
shaken
,
he
say
he
would
shew
the
captain
,
that
he
be
not
the
only
person
of
the
drama
exhibit
for
the
entertainment
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
night
-
scene
,
it
could
not
affect
the
justice
,
who
have
be
purposely
lodge
in
the
farther
end
of
the
house
,
remote
from
the
noise
,
and
lull
with
a
dose
of
opium
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
,
Mr
Justice
be
lead
into
the
parlour
in
his
night
-
cap
and
loose
morning
gown
,
roll
his
head
from
side
to
side
,
and
groan
piteously
all
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jesu
!
<EOS>
neighbour
<EOS>
Frogmore
,
(
exclaim
the
baronet
)
<EOS>
what
be
the
matter
?
  
<EOS>
you
look
as
if
you
be
not
a
man
for
this
world
.
  
<EOS>
Set
him
down
softly
on
the
couch
 
poor
gentleman
!
  
<EOS>
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
!
  
<EOS>
what
make
him
so
pale
,
and
yellow
,
and
bloated
?
"
<EOS>
"
oh
,
sir
Thomas
!
<EOS>
(
cry
the
justice
)
<EOS>
I
doubt
'
tis
all
over
with
me
  
<EOS>
those

eat
at
your

have
do
my

<EOS>
how
do
thy

<EOS>
hah

"
    
<EOS>
to
this
interrogation
he
make
no
reply
,
but
throw
aside
his
night
gown
,
<EOS>
discover
that
his
waistcoat
would
not
meet
upon
his
belly
by
five
good
inch
at
least
.
"
<EOS>
Heaven
protect
us
all
!
<EOS>
(
cry
sir
Thomas
)
 
what
a
melancholy
spectacle
!
  
<EOS>
never
do
I
see
a
man
so
suddenly
swell
,
but
when
he
be
either
just
dead
,
or
just
die

<EOS>
Doctor
,
can'st
thou
do
nothing
for
this
poor
object
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
the
case
be
quite
desperate
(
say
the
surgeon
)
,
but
I
would
advise
Mr
Frogmore
to
settle
his
affair
with
all
expedition
;
the
parson
may
come
and
pray
by
him
,
while
I
prepare
a
clyster
and
an
emetic
draught
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
justice
,
roll
his
languid
eye
,
ejaculate
with
great
fervency
,
"
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
!
<EOS>
Christ
have
mercy
upon
us
!
"
  
<EOS>
then
he
beg
the
surgeon
,
in
the
name
of
God
,
to
dispatch
  
"
<EOS>
as
for
my
wordly
affair
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
they
be
all
settle
but
one
mortgage
,
which
must
be
leave
to
my
heir
 
but
my
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
my
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
what
will
become
of
my
poor
soul
?
 
<EOS>
miserable
sinner
that
I
be
!
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
pr'ythee
my
dear
boy
,
compose
thyself
(
resume
the
knight
)
;
consider
the
mercy
of
heaven
be
infinite
;
thou
can'st
not
have
any
sin
of
a
very
deep
dye
on
thy
conscience

or
the
devil

in't
.
"
<EOS>
"
name
not
the
devil
(
exclaim
the
terrified
Frogmore
)
,
I
have
more
sin
to
answer
for
than
the
world
dream
of

<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
friend
,
I
have
be
sly
 
sly
 
damn'd
sly
!
  
<EOS>
send
for
the
parson
without
loss
of
time
,
and
put
me
to
bed
for
I
be
post
to
eternity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
accordingly
raise
from
the
couch
,
and
support
by
two
servant
,
who
lead
him
back
to
his
room
;
but
before
he
quit
the
parlour
,
he
entreat
the
good
company
to
assist
him
with
their
prayer
.
  
<EOS>
He
add
,
"
take
warning
by
me
who
be
suddenly
cut
off
in
my
prime
,
like
a
flower
of
the
field
;
and
God
forgive
you
,
sir
Thomas
,
for
suffer
such
poisonous
tresh
to
be
eat
at
your
table
.
"
    
<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
remove
out
of
hearing
,
than
the
baronet
abandon
himself
to
a
violent
fit
of
laughing
,
in
which
he
be
join
by
the
great
part
of
the
company
;
but
we
could
hardly
prevent
the
good
lady
from
go
to
undeceive
the
patient
,
by
discover
,
that
while
he
sleep
his
waistcoat
have
be
straiten
by
the
contrivance
of
the
surgeon
;
and
that
the
disorder
in
his
stomach
and
bowel
be
occasion
by
some
animonial
wine
,
which
he
have
take
over
night
,
under
the
denomination
of
plague
-
water
.
  
<EOS>
She
seem
to
think
that
his
apprehension
may
put
an
end
to
his
life
;
the
knight
swear
he
be
no
such
chicken
,
but
a
tough
old
rogue
,
that
would
live
long
enough
to
plague
all
his
neighbour
.
<EOS>
upon
enquiry
,
we
find
his
character
do
not
entitle
him
to
much
compassion
or
respect
,
and
therefore
we
let
our
landlord
's
humour
take
its
course
.
  
<EOS>
a
clyster
be
actually
administer
by
an
old
woman
of
the
family
who
have
be
sir
Thomas
's
nurse
,
and
the
patient
take
a
draught
make
with
oxymel
of
squill
to
forward
the
operation
of
the
antimonial
wine
,
which
have
be
retard
by
the
opiate
of
the
precede
night
.
<EOS>
He
be
visit
by
the
vicar
,
who
read
prayer
,
and
begin
to
take
an
account
of
the
state
of
his
soul
,
when
those
medicine
produce
their
effect
;
so
that
the
parson
be
oblige
to
hold
his
nose
while
he
pour
forth
spiritual
consolation
from
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
the
same
expedient
be
use
by
the
knight
and
me
,
who
,
with
the
doctor
,
enter
the
chamber
at
this
juncture
,
and
find
Frogmore
enthrone
on
an
easy
-
chair
,
under
the
pressure
of
a
double
evacuation
.
<EOS>
the
short
interval
betwixt
<EOS>
every
heave
he
employ
in
cry
for
mercy
,
confess
his
sin
,
or
ask
the
vicar
's
opinion
of
his
case
;
and
the
vicar
answer
,
in
a
solemn
snuffling
tone
,
that
heighten
the
ridicule
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
the
emetic
have
do
its
office
,
the
doctor
interfere
,
and
order
the
patient
to
be
put
in
bed
again
.
<EOS>
when
he
examine
the
egista
,
and
feel
his
pulse
,
he
declare
that
much
of
the
virus
be
discharge
,
and
,
give
him
a
composing
draught
,
assure
him
he
have
good
hope
of
his
recovery
.
  
<EOS>
this
welcome
hint
he
receive
with
the
tear
of
joy
in
his
eye
,
protest
<EOS>
,
that
if
he
should
recover
,
he
would
always
think
himself
indebted
for
his
life
to
the
great
skill
and
tenderness
of
his
doctor
,
whose
hand
he
squeeze
with
great
fervor
;
and
thus
he
be
leave
to
his
repose
.
    
<EOS>
We
be
press
to
stay
dinner
,
that
we
may
be
witness
of
his
resuscitation
but
my
uncle
insist
upon
our
depart
before
noon
,
that
we
may
reach
this
town
before
it
should
be
dark
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
lady
Bullford
conduct
us
into
the
garden
to
see
a
fish
-
pond
just
finish
,
which
Mr
Bramble
censure
as
be
too
near
the
parlour
,
where
the
knight
now
fat
by
himself
,
doze
in
an
-
elbow
chair
after
the
fatigue
of
his
morning
atchievement
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
situation
he
recline
,
with
his
foot
wrap
in
flannel
,
and
support
in
a
line
with
his
body
,
when
the
door
fly
open
with
a
violent
shock
lieutenant
Lismahago
rush
into
the
room
with
horror
in
his
look
,
exclaim
,
"
a
mad
dog
!
<EOS>
a
mad
dog
!
"
and
throw
up
the
window
sash
,
leap
into
the
garden
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
,
wake
by
this
tremendous
exclamation
,
start
up
and
forget
his
gout
,
follow
the
lieutenant
's
example
by
a
kind
of
instinctive
impulse
.
  
<EOS>
He
not
only
bolt
thro
'
the
window
like
an
arrow
from
a
bow
,
but
run
up
to
his
middle
in
the
pond
before
he
give
the
least
sign
of
recollection
.
<EOS>
then
the
captain
begin
to
bawl
,
"
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
!
 
<EOS>
pray
take
care
of
the
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
for
God
's
sake
mind
<EOS>
your
footing
,
my
dear
boy
!
 
<EOS>
get
warm
blanket
 
<EOS>
comfort
his
poor
carcase
 
<EOS>
warm
the
bed
in
the
green
room
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
Lady
Bullford
be
thunder
-
strike
at
this
phenomenon
,
and
the
rest
of
the
company
gaze
in
silent
astonishment
,
while
the
servant
hasten
to
assist
their
master
,
who
suffer
himself
to
be
carry
back
into
the
parlour
without
speak
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
be
instantly
accommodate
with
dry
clothe
and
flannel
,
comfort
with
a
cordial
,
and
replace
in
statu
quo
,
one
of
the
maid
be
order
to
chafe
,
his
low
extremity
,
an
operation
in
consequence
of
which
his
sense
seem
to
return
and
his
good
humour
to
revive
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
have
follow
him
into
the
room
,
he
look
at
every
individual
in
his
turn
,
with
a
certain
ludicrous
expression
in
his
countenance
,
but
fix
his
eye
in
particular
upon
Lismahago
,
who
present
him
with
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
and
when
he
take
it
in
silence
,
"
Sir
Thomas
Bullford
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
I
be
much
oblige
to
you
for
all
your
favour
,
and
some
of
them
I
have
endeavour
to
repay
in
your
own
coin
.
"
<EOS>
"
give
me
thy
hand
(
cry
the
baronet
)
;
thou
hast
indeed
pay
me
Scot
and
lot
;
and
even
leave
a
ballance
in
my
hand
,
for
which
,
in
presence
of
this
company
,
I
promise
to
be
accountable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
laugh
very
heartily
,
and
even
seem
to
enjoy
the
retaliation
which
have
be
exact
at
his
own
expence
;
but
lady
Bullford
look
very
grave
;
and
in
all
probability
think
the
lieutenant
have
carry
his
resentment
too
far
,
consider
that
her
husband
be
valetudinary
 
but
,
accord
to
the
proverb
,
<EOS>
he
that
will
play
at
bowl
must
expect
to
meet
with
rubber
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
see
a
tame
bear
,
very
divert
when
properly
manage
,
become
a
very
dangerous
wild
beast
when
teize
for
the
entertainment
of
the
spectator
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Lismahago
,
he
seem
to
think
the
fright
and
the
cold
bath
would
have
a
good
effect
upon
his
patient
's
constitution
;
but
the
doctor
hint
some
apprehension
that
the
gouty
matter
may
,
by
such
a
sudden
shock
,
be
repel
from
the
extremity
and
throw
upon
some
of
the
more
vital
part
of
the
machine
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
be
very
sorry
to
see
this
prognostic
verify
upon
our
facetious
landlord
,
who
tell
Mrs
Tabitha
at
parting
,
that
he
hope
she
would
remember
him
in
the
distribution
of
the
bride
's
favour
,
as
he
have
take
so
much
pain
to
put
the
captain
's
part
and
mettle
to
the
proof
.
  
<EOS>
after
all
,
I
be
afraid
our
"
squire
will
appear
to
be
the
great
sufferer
by
the
baronet
's
wit
;
for
his
constitution
be
by
no
mean
calculate
for
night
-
alarm
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
yawn
and
shiver
all
day
,
and
go
to
bed
without
supper
;
so
that
,
as
we
have
get
into
good
quarter
,
I
imagine
we
shall
make
a
halt
to
-
morrow
;
in
which
case
,
you
will
have
at
least
one
day
's
respite
from
the
persecution
of
    
J
Melford

Molly
;
hadst
thou
see
him
come
down
the
ladder
,
in
a
shurt
<EOS>
so
scanty
,
tht
it
would
not
kiver
his
nakedness
!
  
<EOS>
the
young
"
squire
call
him
Dunquickset
;
but
he
look
for
all
the
world
like
Cradoc
-
ap
-
Morgan
,
the
ould
tinker
,
that
suffer
at
Abergany
for
steeling
of
kettle
  
<EOS>
then
he
be
a
profane
scuffle
,
and
,
as
Mr
Clinker
say
,
no
well
than
an
impfiddle
,
continually
play
upon
the
pyebill
and
the
new
-
burth
  
<EOS>
I
doubt
he
have
as
little
manner
as
money
;
for
he
cant't
say
a
civil
word
,
much
more
make
me
a
present
of
a
pair
of
glove
for
good
-
will
;
but
he
look
as
if
he
want
to
be
very
forewood
and
familiar
  
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
that
ever
a
gentlewoman
of
year
and
discretion
should
tare
her
air
,
and
cry
and
disporridge
herself
for
such
a
nubjack
!
<EOS>
as
the
song
go
      
<EOS>
"
I
vow
she
would
fain
have
a
burd
<EOS>
that
bid
such
a
price
for
an
owl
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
but
for
,
sartain
,
he
must
have
deal
with
some
Scotch
musician
to
bring
her
to
this
pass
  
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
I
put
my
trust
in
the
Lord
;
and
I
have
get
a
slice
of
witch
elm
sow
in
the
gather
of
my
under
petticoat
;
and
Mr
Clinker
assure
me
,
that
by
the
new
light
of
grease
,
I
may
deify
the
devil
and
all
his
work
  
<EOS>
but
I
nose
what
I
nose
  
<EOS>
if
mistris
should
take
up
with
Lashmyhago
,
this
be
no
sarvice
for
me
  
<EOS>
thank
God
,
there
be
no
want
of
place
;
and
if
it
wan't
for
wan
thing
,
I
would
  
but
,
no
matter
  
Madam
Baynar
's
woman
have
twenty
good
pound
a
-
year
and
parquisite
;
and
dress
like
a
parson
of
distinkson
  
<EOS>
I
dine
with
her
and
the
valley
de
shambles
,
with
bag
and
golden
jacket
;
but
there
be
nothing
kimfittable
to
eat
,
be
as
how
they
live
upon
board
,
and
have
nothing
but
a
piss
of
could
cuddle
tart
and
some
blamangey
,
I
be
tuck
with
the
cullick
,
and
a
murcy
it
be
that
mistriss
have
her
viol
of
assing
in
the
cox
.
    
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
be
say
,
I
think
for
sartain
this
match
will
go
forewood
;
for
thing
be
come
to
a
creesus
;
and
have
see
with
my
own
hay
,
such
smuggling
  
<EOS>
but
I
scorn
for
to
exclose
the
secret
of
the
family
;
and
if
it
wance
come
to
marrying
,
who
nose
but
<EOS>
the
frolick
may
go
round
  
<EOS>
I
believe
as
how
,
Miss
Liddy
would
have
no
reversion
if
her
swan
would
appear
;
and
you
would
be
surprised
,
Molly
,
to
receive
a
bride
's
fever
from
your
humble
servant
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
all
suppository
,
dearl
girl
;
and
I
have
sullenly
promise
to
Mr
Clinker
,
that
neither
man

shall
no
<EOS>
that
arrow
say
a

in

<EOS>
I
hope
to
drink
your

at
Brambleton

in
a

of
October

before

<EOS>
to
miss
Laetitia
Willis
,
at
Gloucester
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
letty
,
this
method
of
write
to
you
from
time
to
time
,
without
any
hope
of
an
answer
,
afford
me
,
I
own
,
<EOS>
some
ease
and
satisfaction
in
the
midst
of
my
dispuiet
,
as
it
in
some
degree
lighten
the
burden
of
affliction
;
but
it
be
at
best
a
very
imperfect
enjoyment
of
friendship
,
because
it
admit
of
no
return
of
confidence
and
good
counsel
  
<EOS>
I
would
give
the
whole
world
to
have
your
company
for
a
single
day
  
<EOS>
I
be
heartily
tired
of
this
itinerant
way
of
life
  
<EOS>
I
be
quite
dizzy
with
a
perpetual
succession
of
object
  
<EOS>
besides
it
be
impossible
to
travel
such
a
length
of
way
,
without
be
expose
to
inconvenience
,
danger
,
and
disagreeable
accident
,
which
prove
very
grievous
to
a
poor
creature
of
weak
nerve
like
me
,
and
make
me
pay
very
dear
for
the
gratification
of
my
curiosity
.
    
<EOS>
Nature
never
intend
me
for
the
busy
world
  
<EOS>
I
long
for
repose
and
solitude
,
where
I
can
enjoy
that
disintereste
friendship
which
be
not
to
be
find
among
crowd
,
and
indulge
those
pleasing
reverie
that
shun
the
hurry
and
tumult
of
fashionable
society
  
<EOS>
unexperience
as
I
be
in
the
commerce
of
life
,
I
have
see
enough
to
give
me
a
disgust
to
the
generality
of
those
who
carry
it
on
  
<EOS>
there
be
such
malice
,
treachery
,
and
dissimulation
,
even
among
profess
friend
and
intimate
companion
,
as
can
not
fail
to
strike
a
virtuous
mind
with
horror
;
and
when
Vice
quit
the
stage
for
a
moment
,
her
place
be
immediately
occupy
by
Folly
;
which
be
often
too
serious
to
excite
any
thing
but
compassion
  
<EOS>
perhaps
I
ought
to
be
silent
on
the
foible
of
my
poor
aunt
;
but
with
you
,
my
dear
Willis
,
I
have
no
secret
;
and
,
truly
,
her
weakness
be
such
as
can
not
be
conceal
.
<EOS>
since
the
first
moment
we
arrive
at
Bath
,
she
have
be
employ
constantly
in
spread
net
for
the
other
sex
;
and
at
length
,
she
have
catch
a
superannuate
lieutenant
,
who
be
in
a
fair
way
to
make
her
change
her
name
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
and
my
brother
seem
to
have
no
objection
to
this
extraordinary
match
,
which
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
will
afford
abundance
of
matter
of
conversation
and
mirth
;
for
my
part
,
I
be
too
sensible
of
my
own
weakness
,
to
be
divert
with
those
of
other
people
  
<EOS>
at
present
,
I
have
something
at
heart
that
employ
my
whole
attention
,
and
keep
my
mind
in
the
utmost
terror
and
suspense
.
    
<EOS>
yesterday
in
the
forenoon
,
as
I
stand
with
my
brother
at
the
parlour
window
of
an
inn
,
where
we
have
lodge
,
a
person
pass
a
-
horseback
,
whom
(
gracious
Heaven
!
)
<EOS>
I
instantly
discover
to
be
Wilson
!
<EOS>
He
wear
a
white
riding
-
coat
,
with
the
cape
button
up
to
his
chin
;
look
remarkably
pale
,
and
pass
at
a
round
trot
,
without
seem
to
observe
us
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
could
not
see
us
;
for
there
be
a
blind
that
conceal
us
from
the
view
.
<EOS>
You
may
guess
how
I
be
affect
at
this
apparition
  
<EOS>
the
light
forsook
my
eye
;
and
I
be
seize
with
such
a
palpitation
and
tremble
,
that
I
could
not
stand
.
<EOS>
I
sit
down
upon
a
couch
,
and
strove
to
compose
myself
,
that
my
brother
may
not
perceive
my
agitation
;
but
it
be
impossible
to
escape
his
pry
eye
  
<EOS>
He
have
observe
the
object
that
alarm
me
;
and
,
doubtless
,
know
him
at
the
first
glance
  
He
now
look
at
me
with
a
stern
countenance
;
then
he
run
out
into
the
street
,
to
see
what
road
the
unfortunate
horseman
have
take
  
He
afterwards
dispatch
his
man
for
further
intelligence
,
and
seem
to
meditate
some
violent
design
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
be
out
of
order
,
we
remain
another
night
at
the
inn
;
and
all
day
long
Jery
act
the
part
of
an
indefatigable
spy
upon
my
conduct
  
<EOS>
He
watch
my
very
look
with
such
eagerness
of
attention
,
as
if
he
would
have
penetrate
into
the
utmost
recess
of
my
heart
  
<EOS>
this
may
be
owe
to
his
regard
for
my
honour
,
if
it
be
not
the
effect
of
his
own
pride
;
but
he
be
so
hot
,
and
violent
,
and
unrelenting
,
that
the
sight
of
him
alone
throw
me
into
a
flutter
;
and
really
it
will
not
be
in
my
power
to
afford
him
any
share
of
my
affection
,
if
he
persist
in
persecute
me
at
this
rate
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
he
have
form
some
scheme
of
vengeance
,
which
will
make
me
completely
wretched
!
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
he
suspect
some
collusion
from
this
appearance
of
Wilson
  
Good
God
!
<EOS>
do
he
really
appear
?
<EOS>
or
be
it
only
a
phantom
,
a
pale
spectre
to
apprise
me
of
his
death
?
    
<EOS>
O
Letty
,
what
shall
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
where
shall
I
turn
for
advice
and
consolation
?
 
<EOS>
shall
I
implore
the
protection
of
my
uncle
,
who
have
be
always
kind
and
compassionate
?
  
<EOS>
this
must
be
my
last
resource
.
  
<EOS>
I
dread
the
thought
of
make
him
uneasy
;
and
would
rather
suffer
a
thousand
death
than
live
the
cause
of
dissension
in
the
family
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
perceive
the
meaning
of
Wilson
's
come
hither
:
 
<EOS>
perhaps
,
he
be
in
quest
of
us
,
in
order
to
disclose
his
real
name
and
situation
:
 
but
wherefore
pass
without
stay
to
make
the
least
inquiry
?
  
<EOS>
My
dear
Willis
,
I
be
lose
in
conjecture
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
close
an
eye
since
I
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
all
night
long
have
I
be
toss
about
from
one
imagination
to
another
.
  
<EOS>
the
reflection
find
no
resting
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
pray
,
and
sigh
,
and
weep
plentifully
.
  
<EOS>
if
this
terrible
suspense
continue
much
longer
,
I
shall
have
another
fit
of
illness
,
and
then
the
whole
family
will
be
in
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
if
it
be
consistent
with
the
wise
purpose
of
Providence
,
would
I
be
in
my
grave
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
my
duty
to
be
resign
.
  
<EOS>
My
dearest
Letty
,
excuse
my
weakness
 
excuse
these
blot
 
<EOS>
my
tear
fall
so
fast
that
I
can
not
keep
the
paper
dry
 
<EOS>
yet
I
ought
to
consider
that
I
have
as
yet
no
cause
to
despair
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
such
a
faint
-
hearted
timorous
creature
!
    
<EOS>
thank
God
,
my
uncle
be
much
well
than
he
be
yesterday
.
  
<EOS>
He

pursue
our
journey
strait
to
Wales

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
I

all
my

friendly
bosom

October

<EOS>
to
Sir
Watkin
Phillips
,
Bart
.
<EOS>
of
Jesus
college
,
Oxon
.
  
<EOS>
dear
WATKIN
,
I
yesterday
meet
with
an
incident
which
I
believe
you
will
own
to
be
very
surprising
  
<EOS>
as
I
stand
with
Liddy
at
the
window
of
the
inn
where
we
have
lodge
,
who
should
pass
by
but
<EOS>
Wilson
a
-
horseback
:
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
be
mistake
in
the
person
,
for
I
have
a
full
view
of
him
as
he
advance
;
I
plainly
perceive
by
my
sister
's
confusion
that
she
recognize
him
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
I
be
equally
astonished
and
incense
at
his
appearance
,
which
I
could
not
but
interpret
into
an
insult
,
or
something
bad
.
<EOS>
I
run
out
at
the
gate
,
and
,
see
him
turn
the
corner
of
the
street
,
I
dispatch
my
servant
to
observe
his
motion
,
but
the
fellow
be
too
late
to
bring
me
that
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
however
,
that
there
be
an
inn
,
call
the
Red
Lion
,
at
that
end
of
the
town
,
where
he
suppose
the
horseman
have
alight
,
but
that
the
would
not
enquire
without
further
order
.
<EOS>
I
send
him
back
immediately
to
know
what
stranger
be
in
the
house
,
and
he
return
with
a
report
that
there
be
one
Mr
Wilson
lately
arrive
.
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
information
I
charge
him
with
a
note
direct
to
that
gentleman
,
desire
him
to
meet
me
in
half
an
hour
in
a
certain
field
at
the
town
's
end
,
with
a
case
of
pistol
,
in
order
to
decide
the
difference
which
could
not
be
determine
at
our
last
rencounter
:
but
I
do
not
think
proper
to
subscribe
the
billet
.
<EOS>
My
man
assure
me
he
have
deliver
it
into
his
own
hand
;
and
,
that
have
read
it
,
he
declare
he
would
wait
upon
the
gentleman
at
the
place
and
time
appoint
.
    
<EOS>
M'Alpine
be
an
old
soldier
,
and
luckily
sober
at
the
time
,
I
entrust
him
with
my
secret
.
<EOS>
I
order
him
to
be
within
call
,
and
,
have
give
him
a
letter
to
be
deliver
to
my
uncle
in
case
of
accident
,
I
repair
to
the
rendezvous
,
which
be
an
inclosed
field
at
a
little
distance
from
the
highway
.
<EOS>
I
find
my
antagonist
have
already
take
his
ground
,
wrap
in
a
dark
horseman
's
coat
,
with
a
lace
hat
flap
over
his
eye
;
but
what
be
my
astonishment
,
when
,
throw
off
this
wrapper
,
he
appear
to
be
a
person
whom
I
have
never
see
before
!
<EOS>
He
have
one
pistol
stick
in
a
leather
belt
,
and
another
in
his
hand
ready
for
action
,
and
,
advance
a
few
step
,
call
to
know
if
I
be
ready
  
<EOS>
I
answer
,
"
no
,
"
and
desire
a
parley
:
upon
which
he
turn
the
muzzle
of
his
piece
towards
the
earth
;
then
replace
it
in
his
belt
,
and
meet
me
half
way
  
<EOS>
when
I
assure
him
he
be
not
the
man
I
expect
to
meet
<EOS>
,
he
say
,
it
may
be
so
:
that
he
have
receive
a
slip
of
paper
direct
to
Mr
Wilson
,
request
him
to
come
hither
;
and
that
as
there
be
no
other
in
the
place
of
that
name
,
he
naturally
conclude
the
note
be
intend
for
him
,
and
him
only
  
<EOS>
I
then
give
him
to
understand
,
that
I
have
be
injure
by
a
person
who
assume
that
name
,
which
person
I
have
actually
see
within
the
hour
,
pass
through
the
street
on
horseback
;
that
hearing
there
be
a
Mr
Wilson
at
the
Red
Lion
<EOS>
,
I
take
it
for
grant
<EOS>
he
be
the
man
,
and
in
that
belief
have
writ
the
billet
;
and
I
express
my
surprize
,
that
he
,
who
be
a
stranger
to
me
and
my
concern
,
should
give
me
such
a
rendezvous
,
without
take
the
trouble
to
demand
a
previous
explanation
  
<EOS>
He
reply
,
that
there
be
no
other
of
his
name
in
the
whole
county
;
that
no
such
horseman
have
alight
at
the
Red
Lion
since
nine
o'clock
,
when
he
arrive
 
that
have
have
the
honour
to
serve
his
majesty
,
he
think
he
could
not
decently
decline
any
invitation
of
this
kind
,
from
what
quarter
soever
it
may
come
;
and
that
if
any
explanation
be
necessary
,
it
do
not
belong
to
him
to
demand
it
,
but
to
the
gentleman
who
summon
him
into
the
field
  
<EOS>
Vexed
as
I
be
at
this
adventure
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
help
admire
the
coolness
of
this
officer
,
whose
open
countenance
prepossess
me
in
his
favour
.
  
<EOS>
He
seem
to
be
turn
of
forty
;
wear
his
own
short
black
hair
,
which
curl
naturally
about
his
ear
,
and
be
very
plain
in
his
apparel
  
when
I
beg
pardon
for
the
trouble
I
have
give
him
,
he
receive
my
apology
with
great
good
humour
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
me
that
he
live
about
ten
mile
off
,
at
a
small
farm
-
house
,
which
would
afford
me
tolerable
lodging
,
if
I
would
come
and
take
the
diversion
of
hunt
with
him
for
a
few
week
;
in
which
case
we
may
,
perhaps
,
find
out
the
man
who
have
give
me
offence
  
<EOS>
I
thank
him
very
sincerely
for
his
courteous
offer
,
which
,
I
tell
him
,
I
be
not
at
liberty
to
accept
at
present
,
on
account
of
my
be
engage
in
a
family
partie
;
and
so
we
part
,
with
mutual
profession
of
good
will
and
esteem
.
    
<EOS>
now
tell
me
,
dear
knight
,
what
be
I
to
make
of
this
singular
adventure
?
  
<EOS>
be
I
to
suppose
that
the
horseman
I
see
be
really
a
thing
of
flesh
and
blood
,
or
a
bubble
that
vanish
into
air
?
 
<EOS>
or
must
I
imagine
Liddy
know
more
of
the
matter
than
she
choose
to
disclose
?
  
<EOS>
if
I
think
her
capable
of
carry
on
any
clandestine
correspondence
with
such
a
fellow
,
I
should
at
once
discard
all
tenderness
,
and
forget
that
she
be
connect
with
me
by
the
tie
of
blood
  
<EOS>
but
how
be
it
possible
that
a
girl
of
her
simplicity
and
inexperience
,
should
maintain
such
an
intercouse
,
surround
,
as
she
be
,
with
so
many
eye
,
destitute
of
all
opportunity
,
and
shift
quarter
every
day
of
her
life
!
  
<EOS>
besides
,
she
have
solemnly
promise
 
<EOS>
no
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
the
girl
so
base
 
<EOS>
so
insensible
to
the
honour
of
her
family
.
  
<EOS>
what
disturb
me
chiefly
,
be
the
impression
which
these
occurrence
seem
to
make
upon
her
spirit
  
<EOS>
these
be
the
symptom
from
which
I
conclude
that
the
rascal
have
still
a
hold
on
her
affection
 
<EOS>
surely
I
have
a
right
to
call
him
a
rascal
,
and
to
conclude
that
his
design
be
infamous
  
<EOS>
but
it
shall
be
my
fault
if
he
do
not
one
day
repent
his
presumption
  
<EOS>
I
confess
I
can
not
think
,
much
less
write
on
this
subject
,
with
any
degree
of
temper
or
patience
;
I
shall
therefore
conclude
with
tell
you
,
that
we
hope
to
be
in
Wales
by
the
latter
end
of
the
month
:
<EOS>
but
before
that
period
you
will
probably
hear
again
from
    
your
affectionate
J
Melford
.
    
October
4
.
    
<EOS>
to
Sir
Watkin
Phillips
,
Bart
.
<EOS>
at
Oxon
.
  
<EOS>
dear
phillips
,
when
I
write
to
you
by
last
post
,
I
do
not
imagine
I
should
be
tempt
to
trouble
you
again
so
soon
:
but
I
now
sit
down
with
a
heart
so
full
that
it
can
not
contain
itself
;
though
I
be
under
such
agitation
of
spirit
,
that
you
be
to
expect
neither
method
or
connexion
in
this
address
  
<EOS>
We
have
be
this
day
within
a
hair
's
breath
of
lose
honest
Mathew
Bramble
,
in
consequence
of
a
curse
accident
,
which
I
will
endeavour
to
explain
.
  
<EOS>
in
cross
the
country
to
get
into
the
post
road
,
it
be
necessary
to
ford
a
river
,
and
we
that
be
a
-
horseback
pass
without
any
danger
on
difficulty
;
but
a
great
quantity
of
rain
have
fall
last
night
and
this
morning
,
there
be
such
an
accumulation
of
water
,
that
a
mill
-
head
give
way
,
just
as
the
coach
be
pass
under
it
,
and
the
flood
rush
down
with
such
impetuosity
,
as
first
float
,
and
then
fairly
overturn
the
carriage
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
  
Lismahago
and
I
,
and
the
two
servant
,
alight
instantaneously
,
run
into
the
river
to
give
all
the
assistance
in
our
power
.
  
<EOS>
Our
aunt
,
Mrs
Tabitha
,
who
have
the
good
fortune
to
be
uppermost
,
be
already
half
way
out
of
the
coach
window
,
when
her
lover
approach
,
disengage
her
entirely
;
but
,
whether
his
foot
slipt
or
the
burden
be
too
great
,
they
fall
over
head
and
ear
in
each
other
arm
.
<EOS>
He
endeavour
more
than
once
to
get
up
,
and
even
to
disentagle
himself
from
her
embrace
,
but
she
hang
about
his
neck
like
a
mill
-
stone
(
no
bad
emblem
of
matrimony
,
)
and
if
my
man
have
not
prove
a
staunch
auxiliary
,
those
two
lover
would
in
all
probability
have
go
hand
in
hand
to
the
shade
below
  
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
be
too
much
engage
to
take
any
cognizance
of
their
distress
.
  
<EOS>
I
snatch
out
my
sister
by
the
hair
of
the
head
,
and
,
drag
her
to
the
bank
,
recollect
that
my
uncle
have
not
yet
appear
  
rush
again
into
the
stream
,
I
meet
Clinker
haul
ashore
<EOS>
Mrs
Jenkins
,
who
look
like
a
mermaid
with
her
hair
dishevel
about
her
ear
;
but
,
when
I
ask
if
his
master
be
safe
,
he
forthwith
shake
her
from
him
,
and
she
must
have
go
to
pot
,
if
a
miller
have
not
seasonably
come
to
her
relief
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Humphry
,
he
fly
like
lightne
to
the
coach
,
that
be
by
this
time
fill
with
water
,
and
,
dive
into
it
,
bring
up
the
poor
"
squire
,
to
all
appearance
,
deprive
of
life
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
my
power
to
describe
what
I
feel
at
this
melancholy
spectacle
  
<EOS>
it
be
such
an
agony
as
baffles
all
description
!
<EOS>
the
faithful
Clinker
,
take
him
up
in
his
arm
,
as
if
he
have
be
an
infant
of
six
month
,
carry
him
ashore
,
howl
most
petiously
all
the
way
,
and
I
follow
him
in
a
transport
of
grief
and
consternation
  
<EOS>
when
he
be
lay
upon
the
grass
,
and
turn
from
side
to
side
,
a
great
quantity
of
water
run
out
at
his
mouth
,
then
he
open
his
eye
,
and
fetch
a
deep
sigh
  
clinker
perceive
these
sign
of
life
,
immediately
tie
up
his
arm
with
a
garter
,
and
,
pull
out
a
horse
-
sleam
,
let
him
blood
in
the
farri
stile
.
  
<EOS>
at
first
a
few
drop
only
issue
from
the
orifice
;
but
the
limb
be
chafe
,
in
a
little
time
the
blood
begin
to
flow
in
a
continued
stream
,
and
he
utter
some
incoherent
word
,
which
be
the
most
welcome
sound
that
ever
salute
my
ear
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
country
inn
hear
by
,
the
landlord
of
which
have
by
this
time
come
with
his
people
to
give
their
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
thither
my
uncle
be
carry
,
be
undress
and
put
to
bed
,
wrap
in
warm
blanket
;
but
have
be
move
too
soon
,
he
faint
away
,
and
once
more
lie
without
sense
or
motion
,
notwithstanding
all
the
effort
of
Clinker
and
the
landlord
,
who
bathe
his
temple
with
Hungary
water
,
and
hold
a
smell
bottle
to
his
nose
.
<EOS>
as
I
have
hear
of
the
efficacy
of
salt
in
such
case
,
I
order
all
that
be
in
the
house
to
be
lay
under
his
head
and
body
;
and
whither
this
application
have
the
desire
effect
,
or
nature
of
herself
prevail
,
he
,
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
begin
to
breathe
regularly
,
and
soon
retrieve
his
recollection
,
to
the
unspeakable
joy
of
all
the
by
-
stander
.
<EOS>
as
for
Clinker
,
his
brain
seem
to
be
affect
.
  
<EOS>
He
laugh
,
and
weep
,
and
dance
about
in
such
a
distracted
manner
,
that
the
landlord
very
judiciously
convey
him
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
see
me
drop
wet
,
comprehend
the
whole
of
what
have
happen
,
and
ask
if
all
the
company
be
safe
?
  
<EOS>
be
answer
in
all
the
affirmative
,
he
insist
on
my
putting
on
dry
clothe
?
<EOS>
and
,
have
swallow
a
little
warm
wine
,
desire
he
may
be
leave
to
his
repose
.
<EOS>
before
I
go
to
shift
myself
,
I
inquire
about
the
rest
of
the
family
  
<EOS>
I
find
Mrs
Tabitha
still
delirious
from
her
fright
,
discharge
very
copiously
the
water
she
have
swallow
.
<EOS>
She
be
support
by
the
captain
,
distil
drop
from
his
uncurled
periwig
,
so
lank
and
so
dank
,
that
he
look
like
father
Thame
without
his
sedge
,
embrace
Isis
,
while
she
cascade
in
his
urn
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Jenkins
be
present
also
,
in
a
loose
bedgown
,
without
either
cap
or
handkerchief
;
but
she
seem
to
be
as
little
compos
mentis
as
her
mistress
,
and
act
so
many
cross
purpose
in
the
course
of
her
attendance
,
that
,
between
the
two
,
Lismahago
have
occasion
for
all
his
philosophy
.
<EOS>
as
for
Liddy
,
I
think
the
poor
girl
would
have
actually
lose
her
sense
.
<EOS>
the
good
woman
of
the
house
have
shift
her
linen
,
and
put
her
into
bed
;
but
she
be
seize
with
the
idea
that
her
uncle
have
perish
,
and
in
this
persuasion
make
a
dismal
out
-
cry
;
nor
do
she
pay
the
least
regard
to
what
I
say
,
when
I
solemnly
assure
her
he
be
safe
.
<EOS>
Mr
bramble
hear
the
noise
,
and
be
inform
of
her
apprehension
,
desire
she
may
be
bring
into
his
chamber
;
and
she
no
sooner
receive
this
intimation
,
than
she
run
thither
half
naked
,
with
the
wildest
expression
of
eagerness
in
her
countenance
  
see
the
"
squire
sit
up
in
the
bed
,
she
spring
forwards
,
and
,
throw
her
arm
about
his
neck
,
exclaim
in
a
most
pathetic
tone
,
"
<EOS>
be
you
 
<EOS>
be
you
indeed
my
uncle
 
<EOS>
My
dear
uncle

<EOS>
My
good
friend

<EOS>
My
father
!
  
<EOS>
be
you
really
live
?
<EOS>
or
be
it
an
illusion
of
my
poor
brain
!
"
<EOS>
honest
Matthew
be
so
much
affected
,
that
he
could
not
help
shed
tear
,
while
he
kiss
her
forehead
,
say
,
"
My
dear
Liddy
,
I
hope
I
shall
live
long
enough
to
shew
how
sensible
I
be
of
your
affection
  
<EOS>
but
your
spirit
be
flutter
,
child
  
<EOS>
You
want
rest
  
<EOS>
go
to
bed
and
compose
yourself
  
<EOS>
well
,
I
will
(
she
reply
)
 
but
still
methink
<EOS>
this
can
not
be
real
  
<EOS>
the
coach
be
full
of
water
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
be
under
us
all
  
gracious
God
!
  
<EOS>
You
be
under
water
  
<EOS>
how
do
you
get
out
?
 
<EOS>
tell
me
that
?
<EOS>
or
I
shall
think
this
be
all
a
deception
 
"
<EOS>
"
in
what
manner
I
be
bring
out
,
I
know
as
little
as
you
do
,
my
dear
(
say
the
"
squire
)
;
and
truly
that
be
a
circumstance
of
which
I
want
to
be
inform
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
give
him
a
detail
of
the
whole
adventure
,
but
he
would
not
hear
me
until
I
should
change
my
clothe
;
so
that
I
have
only
time
to
tell
him
,
that
he
owe
his
life
to
the
courage
and
fidelity
of
Clinker
;
and
have
give
him
this
hint
,
I
conduct
my
sister
to
her
own
chamber
.
    
<EOS>
this
accident
happen
about
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
and
in
little
more
than
an
hour
the
hurricane
be
all
over
;
but
as
the
carriage
be
find
to
be
so
much
damage
,
that
it
could
not
proceed
without
considerable
repair
,
a
blacksmith
and
wheelwright
be
immediately
send
for
to
the
next
market

town

and
we
congratulate
ourselves
upon
be
house
at
an
inn

which
,
though
remote
from

road
,

good
lodging

<EOS>
the
woman
be
pretty
well
compose
,
and
the
man

,
my
uncle
send
for
his

in

of
Lismahago

accost
him
in
these

so
,
Clinker

I
find
you

I
shall
not

by
water
  
<EOS>
as
you

fish
me
up
from

bottom
at
your

at

entitled

all

<EOS>
so
say
,
he
present
him
with
a
purse
contain
thirty
guinea
,
and
a
ring
nearly
of
the
same
value
  
<EOS>
"
God
forbid

(
cry
Clinker
)
<EOS>
your
honour
shall
excuse
me
  
<EOS>
I
be
a
poor

I
have
a

but
as
for
the

I
renounce
it
  
<EOS>
I
have
do
no

when
he
quit

Lismahago

have

Mr
Bramble
make
no

proceed
from
the

resentment
of

in

the

tell
the

his

much
at

he
be
sure
he

<EOS>
He
give
us
to
understand
that
his

who
live
hard

would
not
suffer
us
to
be
at
a
publick
house
,
when
there
be
accommodation
for
us
at
his
own
;
and
that
,
if
he
have
not
dine
abroad
in

he
would
have
undoubtedly
come
to
offer
his
service
at

<EOS>
He
then
launch
out
in
praise
of
that
gentleman
,
whom
he
have
serve
as
butler

represent
him
as
a
perfect
miracle
of
goodness

generosity

<EOS>
He
say
he
be
a
person
of
great
learning
,
and
allow
to
be
the
good
farmer
in
the
country
:
 
that
he
have
a
lady
who
be
as
much
beloved
as
himself

an

son

a
very
hopeful
young

just
recover
from
a
dangerous
fever

which
have
like
to
have
prove
fatal
to

if

die

he
be
sure
the

would
not

survive
their
loss

He

finish
the
encomium
of
Mr
Dennison

when
this
gentleman

his
appearance
seem
to
justify
all

He

pretty
well
advanced

express
his
hope

the

would
not

for

You
see
,
Doctor

that
,
notwithstanding
all
your
philosophy
,
it
be
not
without
some
reason
that
we
Welshmen
ascribe
such
energy
to
the
force
of
blood
  
<EOS>
but
we
shall
discuss
this
point
on
some
future
occasion

<EOS>
this
be
not
the
only
discovery
which
I
make
in

of
our

We

to
be

upon

<EOS>
the
lord
of
the

no
other

Charles

our

We
be
now
happily
house
with
that
gentleman

<EOS>
these

an

just
such

have
wish
that

would
bestow
to
fill
up
the
measure
of
their
enjoyment
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
they
know
no

allay
to
their
happiness

but
their
apprehension
and
anxiety
about
the
life
and
concern
,
of
this
beloved
object

<EOS>
Our
old
friend
,
who
have
the
misfortune
to
be
a
second
brother
,
be
breed
to
the
law
,
and
even
call
to
the
bar
;
but
he
do
not
find
himself
qualified
to
shine
in
that
province
,
and
have
very
little
inclination
for
his
profession
  
<EOS>
He
disoblige
his
father
,
by
marry
for
love
,
without
any
consideration
of
fortune
;
so
that
he
have
little
or
no
-
think
to
depend
upon
for
some
year
but
his
practice
,
which
afford
him
a
bare
subsistance
;
and
the
prospect
of
an
increase
family
,
begin
to
give
him
disturbance
and
disquiet
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
his
father
die
,
be
succeed
by
his
eld
brother
,
a
fox
-
hunter
,
and
a
sot
,
who
neglect
his
affair
,
insult
and
oppress
his
servant
,
and
in
a
few
year
have
well
nigh
ruin
the
estate
,
when
he
be
happily
carry
off
by
a
fever
,
the
immediate
consequence
of
a
debauch
.
<EOS>
Charles
,
with
the
approbation
of
his
wife
,
immediately
determine
to
quit
business
,
and
retire
into
the
country
,
although
this
resolution
be
strenuously
and
zealously
oppose
by
every
individual
,
whom
he
consult
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
those
who
have
try
the
experiment
,
assure
him
that
he
could
not
pretend
to
breathe
in
the
country
for
less
than
the
double
of
what
his
estate
produce
;
that
,
in
order
to
be
upon
the
footing
of
a
gentleman
,
he
would
be
oblige
to
keep
horse
,
hound
,
carriage
,
with
a
suitable
number
of
servant
,
and
maintain
an
elegant
table
for
the
entertainment
of
his
neighbour
;
the
farming
be
a
mystery
,
know
only
to
those
who
have
be
breed
up
to
it
from
the
cradle
,
the
success
of
it
depend
not
only
upon
skill
and
industry
,
but
also
upon
such
attention
and
oeconomy
as
no
gentleman
could
be
suppose
to
give
or
practice
;
accordingly
every
attempt
make
by
gentleman
miscarry
,
and
not
a
few
have
be
ruin
by
their
prosecution
of
agriculture
  
<EOS>
Nay
,
they
affirm
that
he
would
find
it
cheap
to
buy
hay
and
oats
for
his
cattle
,
and
to
go
to
market
for
poultry
,
egg
,
kitchen
herbs
,
and
root
,
and
every
the
most
inconsiderable
article
of
house
-
keeping
,
than
to
have
those
article
produce
on
his
own
ground
.
    
<EOS>
these
objection
do
not
deter
Mr
Dennison
,
because
they
be
chiefly
found
on
the
supposition
,
that
he
would
be
oblige
to
lead
a
life
of
extravagance
and
dissipation
,
which
he
and
his
consort
equally
detest
,
despise
,
and
determine
to
avoid
  
<EOS>
the
object
he
have
in
view
,
be
health
of
body
,
peace
of
mind
,
and
the
private
satisfaction
of
domestic
quiet
,
unallye
by
actual
want
,
and
uninterrupted
by
the
fear
of
indigence
  
<EOS>
He
be
very
moderate
in
his
estimate
of
the
necessary
,
and
even
of
the
comfort
of
life
  
<EOS>
He
require
nothing
but
wholsome
air
,
pure
water
,
agreeable
exercise
,
plain
diet
,
convenient
lodging
,
and
decent
apparel
.
<EOS>
He
reflect
,
that
if
a
peasant
without
education
,
or
any
great
share
of
natural
sagacity
,
could
maintain
a
large
family
,
and
even
become
opulent
upon
a
farm
,
for
which
he
pay
an
annual
rent
of
two
or
three
hundred
pound
to
the
landlord
,
surely
he
himself
may
hope
for
some
success
from
his
industry
,
have
no
rent
to
pay
<EOS>
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
three
or
four
hundere
pound
a
-
year
to
receive
  
<EOS>
He
consider
,
that
the
earth
be
an
indulgent
mother
<EOS>
,
that
yield
her
fruit
to
all
her
child
without
distinction
.
<EOS>
He
have
study
the
theory
of
agriculture
with
a
degree
of
eagerness
and
delight
;
and
he
could
not
conceive
there
be
any
mystery
in
the
practice
,
but
what
he
should
be
able
to
disclose
by
dint
of
care
and
application
.
<EOS>
with
respect
to
houshould
expence
,
he
enter
into
a
minute
detail
and
investigation
,
by
which
he
perceive
the
assertion
of
his
friend
be
altogether
erroneous
  
<EOS>
He
find
he
should
save
sixty
pound
a
-
year
in
the
single
article
of
house
-
rent
,
and
as
much
more
in
pocket
-
money
and
contingency
;
that
even
butcher's
-
meat
be
twenty
per
cent
.
<EOS>
cheap
in
the
country
than
in
London
;
but
that
poultry
,
and
almost
every
other
circumstance
of
house
-
keeping
,
may
be
have
for
less
than
one
half
of
what
they
cost
in
town
;
besides
,
a
considerable
saving
on
the
side
of
dress
,
in
be
deliver
from
the
oppressive
imposition
of
ridiculous
mode
,
invent
by
ignorance
,
and
adobte
by
folly
.
    
<EOS>
as
to
the
danger
of
vie
with
the
rich
in
pomp
and
equipage
,
it
never
give
him
the
least
disturbance
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
turn
of
forty
,
and
,
have
live
half
that
time
in
the
busy
scene
of
life
,
be
well
skilled
in
the
science
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
there
can
not
be
in
nature
a
more
contemptible
figure
than
that
of
man
,
who
with
five
hundere
a
year
presume
to
rival
in
expence
a
neighbour
who
possess
five
time
that
income
  
<EOS>
His
ostentation
,
far
from
conceal
,
seve
only
to
discover
his
indigence
,
and
render
his
vanity
the
more
shocking
;
for
it
attract
the
eye
of
censure
,
and
excite
the
spirit
of
inquiry
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
family
in
the
county
,
nor
a
servant
in
his
own
house
,
nor
a
farmer
in
the
parish
,
but
what
know
the
utmost
farthing
that
his
land
produce
,
and
all
these
behold
him
with
scorn
or
compassion
.
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
that
these
reflection
do
not
occur
to
person
in
this
unhappy
dilemma
,
and
produce
a
salutary
effect
;
but
the
truth
be
,
of
all
the
passion
incident
to
human
man
nature
,
vanity
be
that
which
most
effectually
pervert
the
faculty
of
the
understanding
;
nay
,
it
sometimes
become
so
incredibly
deprave
,
as
to
aspire
at
infamy
,

find
pleasure
in
bear
the
stigma
of
reproach

<EOS>
I
have
now
give
you
a
sketch
of
the
character
and
situation
of
Mr
Dennison

when
he
come
down

take
possession
of

as

It
be
on
the
morning
after
our
arrival
that

walk
out
with
my

Mr
Dennison

I
could
not
help
break
forth
into
the
warm
expression
of
applause
at
the
beauty
of
the
scence
,
which
be
really
inchanting
;
and
I
signify
,
in
particular
,
how
much
I
be
pleased
with
the
disposition
of
some
detach
grove
,
that
afford
at
once
shelter
and
ornament
to
his

"
when
I
take
possession
of
these

about
two

twenty

there
be
not
a

It
be
in
the
gloomy
month
of
November

when
I
arrive

and
find
the
house
in
such
a
condition
,
that
it
may
have

justly

the
tower
of
desolution

the

yard
be
cover
with
nettle
and

and
the

exhibit
such
a
rank
plantation
of

as
I
have
never

the
window

in
piece

and
owl

take
possession
of
the

the
prospect
within
be
still
more
dreary

dirty

penetrate
in
several

in
some
apartment
the
very

there
be
not

fringed
curtain

in

there
be
no

the

the
cellar
afford
nothing

a

empty

an

have
leave
it

alledging

among

that
they
could
not
sleep
for
frightful
noise

that
my
poor

certainly
walk
after
his
death

<EOS>
in
a
word
,
the
house
appear
uninhabitable
;
the
barn
,
stable
,
and
our
house
be
in
ruin

the
farmer
who
keep
the

I
have
any

He
rent
a
farm

sixty
pound

his

<EOS>
He
have
form
a
scheme
of
be
appoint
bailiff
to
the
estate

and
of
convert
the
house
and
the
adjacent
ground
to
his
own
use

<EOS>
a
hint
of
his
intention
I
receive
from
the
curate
at
my
first
arrival
;
I
therefore
do
not
pay
much
regard
to
what
he
say
by
way
of
discourage
me
from
come
to
settle
in
the
country
;
but
I
be
a
little
startled
when
he
give
me
warn
that
he
should
quit
the
farm
at
the
expiration
of
his
lease
,
unless
I
would
abate
considerably
in
the
rent

"
at
this
period
I
accidentally
become
acquainted
with
a
person
,
whose
friendship
lay
the
foundation
of
all
my
prosperity
.
<EOS>
in
the
next
market

town

I
chance
to
dine
at
an
inn
with
a
Mr
Wilson
,
who
be
lately
come
to
settle
in
the
neighbourhood
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
be
lieutenant
of
a
man
of
war

but
quit
the
sea
in
some
disgust
,
and
marry
the
only
daughter
of
farmer
Bland
,
who
live
in
this
parish
,
and
have
acquire
a
good
fortune
in
the
way
of
husbandry

<EOS>
Wilson
be
one
of
the
good
natured
man
I
ever
know

brave

frank
,
obliging
,
and
ingenous

<EOS>
He
like
my
conversation
,
I
be
charm
with
his
liberal
manner
;
an
acquaintance
immediately
commence
,
and
this
be
soon
improve
into
a
frendship
without
reserve
  
<EOS>
there
be
character
which
,
like
similar
particular
of
matter
strongly
attract
each
other
  
<EOS>
He
forthwith
introduce
me
to
his
father
-
in

law
,
farmer
Bland
,
who
be
well
acquaint
with
every
acre
of
my
estate
,
of
consequence
well
qualified
to
advise
me
on
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Finding
<EOS>
I
be
incline
to
embrace
a
country
life
,
and
even
to
amuse
myself
with
the
occupation
of
farming
,
he
approve
of
my
design
  
<EOS>
He
give
me
to
understand
that
all
my
farm
be
underlet
;
that
the
estate
be
capable
of
great
improvement
;
that
there
be
plenty
of
chalk
in
the
neighbourhood
;
and
that
my
own
ground
produce
excellent
marle
for
manure
.
  
<EOS>
with
respect
to
the
farm
,
which
be
like
to
fall
into
my
hand
,
he
say
he
would
willingly
take
it
at
the
present
rent
;
but
at
the
same
time
own
,
that
if
I
would
expend
two
hundred
pound
in
enclosure
,
it
would
be
worth
more
than
double
the
sum
.
    
<EOS>
"
thus
encourage
,
I
begin
the
execution
of
my
scheme
without
further
delay
,
and
plunge
into
a
sea
of
expence
,
though
I
have
no
fund
in
reserve

produce
of
the

before
he
take
this
rash
step

he
write
me
a

explain
his
objection
to
the
match

declare
,
that
he
would
keep
himself

he
would
understand
that
his
parent
would
dispense
with
his
contracting
an
engagement
that
must
make
him
miserable
for
life

he
prescribe
the
form
of
advertising
in
a
certain
news

paper

he
may
be
apprize
of
our

good
old
lady
press
them
both
in
their
turn
to
her
breast
  
<EOS>
the
lover
be
too
much
affect
to
get
rid
of
their
embarrassment
for
one
day
;
but
the
scene
be
much
enliven
by
the
arrival
of
Jack
Wilson
,
who
bring
,
as
usual
,
some
game
of
his
own
killing
  
His
honest
countenance
be
a
good
letter
of
recommendation
.
  
<EOS>
I
receive
him
like
a
dear
friend
after
a
long
separation
;
and
I
could
not
help
wonder
to
see
him
shake
Jery
by
the
hand
as
an
old
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
,
indeed
,
be
acquaint
some
day
,
in
consequence
of
a
divert
incident
,
which
I
shall
explain
at
meeting
.
  
<EOS>
that
same
night
a
consultation
be
hold
upon
the
concern
of
the
lover
,
when
the
match
be
formally
agree
to
,
and
all
the
marriage
-
article
be
settle
without
the
least
dispute
.
  
<EOS>
My
nephew
and
I
promise
to
make
Liddy
's
fortune
five
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dennison
declare
,
he
would
make
over
one
half
of
his
estate
immediately
to
his
son
,
and
that
his
daughter
-
in
-
law
should
be
secure
in
a
jointure
of
four
hundred
.
  
<EOS>
Tabby
propose
,
that
,
consider
their
youth
,
they
should
undergo
one
year
at
least
of
probation
before
the
indissoluble
knot
should
be
tie
;
but
the
young
gentleman
be
very
impatient
and
importunate
,
and
the
scheme
imply
that
the
young
couple
should
live
in
the
house
,
under
the
wing
of
his
parent
,
we
resolve
to
make
them
happy
without
further
delay
.
    
<EOS>
as
the
law
require
that
the
party
should
be
some
week
resident
in
the
parish
,
we
shall
stay
here
till
the
ceremony
be
perform
  
<EOS>
Mr
Lismahago
request
that
he
may
take
the
benefit
of
the
same
occasion
;
so
that
next
Sunday
the
bann
will
be
publish
for
all
four
together
.
  
<EOS>
I
doubt
,
I
shall
not
be
able
to
pass
my
Christmas
with
you
at
Brambleton
-
hall
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
be
so
agreeably
situate
in
this
place
,
that
I
have
no
desire
to
shift
my
quarter
;
and
I
foresee
,
that
when
the
day
of
separation
come
,
there
will
be
abundance
of
sorrow
on
all
side
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
we
must
make
the
most
of
those
blessing
which
Heaven
bestow
.
  
<EOS>
consider
how
you
be
tether
by
your
profession
,
I
can
not
hope
to
see
you
so
far
from
home
;
yet
the
distance
do
not
exceed
a
summer's
-
day
's
journey
,
and
Charles
Dennison
,
who
desire
to
be
remember
to
you
,
would
be
rejoice
to
see
his
old
compotator
;
but
as
I
be
now
stationary
,
I
expect
regular
answer
to
the
epistle
of
    
your

<EOS>
to
Sir
Watkin

<EOS>
at
Oxon
.
  
<EOS>
dear
WAT
,
every
day
be
now
big
with
incident
and
discovery
  
<EOS>
young
Mr
Dennison
prove
to
be
no
other
than
that
identical
person
whom
I
have
execrate
so
long
under
the
name
of
Wilson
  
<EOS>
He
have
elope
from
college
at
Cambridge
,
to
avoid
a
match
that
he
detest
,
and
act
in
different
part
of
the
country
as
a
stroller
,
untill
the
lady
in
question
make
choice
of
a
husband
for
herself
<EOS>
then
he
return
to
his
father
,
and
disclose
his
passion
for
Liddy
,
which
meet
with
the
approbation
of
his
parent
,
though
the
father
little
imagine
that
Mr
Bramble
be
his
old
companion
Matthew
Loyd
.
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
,
be
empower
to
make
honourable
proposal
to
my
uncle
and
me
,
have
be
in
search
of
us
all
over
England
,
without
effect
;
and
he
<EOS>
it
be
whom
I
have
see
pass
on
horseback
by
the
window
of
the
inn
,
where
I
stand
with
my
sister
,
but
he
little
dream
that
we
be
in
the
house
  
<EOS>
as
for
the
real
Mr
Wilson
,
whom
I
call
forth
to
combat
,
by
mistake
,
he
be
the
neighbour
and
intimate
friend
of
old
Mr
Dennison
,
and
this
connection
have
suggest
to
the
son
the
idea
of
take
that
name
while
he
remain
in
obscurity
.
    
<EOS>
You
may
easily
conceive
what
pleasure
<EOS>
I
must
have
feel
on
discover
that
the
honour
of
your
family
be
in
no
danger
from
the
conduct
of
a
sister
,
whom
I
love
with
uncommon
affection
;
that
,
instead
of
debase
her
sentiment
and
view
to
a
wretched
stroller
,
she
have
really
captivate
the
heart
of
a
gentleman
,
her
equal
in
rank
and
superior
in
fortune
;
and
that
,
as
his
parent
approve
of
his
attachment
,
I
be
on
the
eve
of
acquire
a
brother
-
in
-
law
so
worthy
of
my
friendship
and
esteem
.
<EOS>
George
Dennison
be
,
without
all
question
,
one
of
the
most
accomplished
young
fellow
in
England
.
<EOS>
His
person
be
at
once
elegant
and
manly
,
and
his
understanding
highly
cultivate
.
<EOS>
though
his
spirit
be
lofty
,
his
heart
be
kind
;
and
his
manner
so
engage
,
as
to
command
veneration
and
love
,
even
from
malice
and
indifference
.
<EOS>
when
I
weigh
my
own
character
with
his
,
I
be
ashamed
to
find
myself
so
light
in
the
balance
;
but
the
comparison
excite
no
envy
  
<EOS>
I
propose
him
as
a
model
for
imitation
  
I
have
endeavour
to
recommend
myself
to
his
friendship
,
and
hope
I
have
already
find
a
place
in
his
affection
.
<EOS>
I
be
,
however
,
mortify
to
reflect
what
flagrant
injustice
we
every
day
commit
,
and
what
absurd
judgment
we
form
,
in
view
object
through
the
falsifying
medium
of
prejudice
and
passion
,
have
you
ask
me
a
few
day
ago
,
the
picture
of
Wilson
the
player
,
I
should
have
draw
a
portrait
very
unlike
the
real
person
and
character
of
George
Dennison
  
<EOS>
without
all
doubt
,
the
great
advantage
acquire
in
travel
and
peruse
mankind
in
the
original
,
be
that
of
dispel
those
shameful
cloud
that
darken
the
faculty
of
the
mind
,
prevent
it
from
judge
with
candour
and
precision
.
    
<EOS>
the
real
Wilson
be
a
great
original
,
and
the
best
temper
,
companionable
man
I
ever
know
  
<EOS>
I
question
if
ever
he
be
angry
or
low
spirited
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
make
no
pretension
to
letter
;
but
he
be
an
adept
in
every
thing
else
that
can
be
either
useful
or
entertaining
.
<EOS>
among
other
qualification
,
he
be
a
complete
sportsman
,
and
count
the
good
shot
in
the
county
.
<EOS>
He
and
Dennison
,
and
Lismahago
and
I
,
attend
by
Clinker
,
go
a
shooting
yesterday
,
and
make
great
havock
among
-
the
partridge
  
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
we
shall
take
the
field
against
the
woodcock
and
snipe
,
<EOS>
in
the
evening
we
dance
and
sing
,
or
play
at
commerce
,
loo
and
quadrille
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Dennison
be
an
elegant
poet
,
and
have
write
some
detach
piece
on
the
subject
of
his
passion
for
Liddy
,
which
must
be
very
flattering
to
the
vanity
of
a
young
woman
  
<EOS>
perhaps
he
be
one
of
the
great
theatrical
genius
that
ever
appear
.
<EOS>
He
sometimes
entertain
us
with
recite
favourite
speech
from
our
good
play
.
<EOS>
We
be
resolve
to
convert
the
great
hall
into
a
theatre
,
and
get
up
the
Beaux
Stratagem
without
delay
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
shall
make
no
contemptible
figure
in
the
character
of
Scrub
;
and
Lismahago
will
be
very
great
in
Captain
Gibbet
  
<EOS>
Wilson
undertake
to
entertain
the
country
people
with
Harlequin
Skeleton
,
for
which
he
have
get
a
jacket
ready
paint
with
his
own
hand
.
    
<EOS>
Our
society
be
really
enchanting
.
<EOS>
even
the
severity
of
Lismahago
relax
,
and
the
vinegar
of
Mrs
Tabby
be
remarkably
dulcify
,
ever
since
it
be
agree
that
she
should
take
precedency
of
her
niece
in
be
first
noosed
:
for
,
you
must
know
,
the
day
be
fix
for
Liddy
's
marriage
;
and
the
bann
for
both
couple
have
be
already
once
publish
in
the
parish
church
.
<EOS>
the
captain
earnestly
beg
that
one
trouble
may
serve
for
all
,
and
Tabitha
assent
with
a
vile
affectation
of
reluctance
.
<EOS>
Her
inamorata
,
who
come
hither
very
slenderly
equipt
,
have
send
for
his
baggage
to
London
,
which
,
in
all
probability
,
will
not
arrive
in
time
for
the
wedding
;
but
it
be
of
no
great
consequence
,
as
every
thing
be
to
be
transact
with
the
utmost
privacy
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
direction
be
give
for
make
out
the
contract
of
marriage
;
which
be
very
favourable
for
both
female
;
Liddy
will
be
secure
in
a
good
jointure
;
and
her
aunt
will
remain
mistress
of
her
own
fortune
,
except
one
half
of
the
interest
,
which
her
husband
shall
have
a
right
to
enjoy
for
his
natural
life
:
I
think
this
be
as
little
in
conscience
as
can
be
do
for
a
man
who
yoke
with
such
a
partner
for
life
.
    
<EOS>
these
expectant
seem
to
be
so
happy
,
that
if
Mr
Dennison
have
an
agreeable
daughter
,
I
believe
,
I
should
be
for
make
the
third
couple
in
this
country
dance
.
<EOS>
the
humour
seem
to
be
infectious
;
for
Clinker
,
alias
Loyd
,
have
a
month
's
mind
to
play
the
fool
,
in
the
same
fashion
,
with
Mrs
Winifred
Jenkins
.
<EOS>
He
have
even
sound
me
on
the
subject
;
but
I
have
give
him
no
encouragement
to
prosecute
this
scheme
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
think
he
may
do
better
,
as
there
be
no
engagement
nor
promise
subsisting
;
that
I
do
not
know
what
design
my
uncle
may
have
form
for
his
advantage
;
but
I
be
of
opinion
,
that
he
should
not
,
at
present
,
run
the
risque
of
disoblige
him
by
any
premature
application
of
this
nature
  
Honest
Humphry
protest
,
he
would
suffer
death
sooner
than
do
or
say
any
thing
that
should
give
offence
to
the
"
squire
<EOS>
but
he
own
he
have
a
kindness
for
the
young
woman
and
have
reason
to
think
she
look
upon
him
with
a
favourable
eye
;
that
he
consider
this
mutual
manifestation
of
good
will
,
as
an
engagement
understand
,
which
ought
to
be
bind
to
the
conscience
of
an
honest
man
;
and
he
hope
the
"
squire
<EOS>
and
I
would
be
of
the
same
opinion
,
when
we
should
be
at
leisure
to
bestow
any
thought
about
the
matter
  
<EOS>
I
believe
he
be
in
the
right
;
and
we
shall
find
time
to
take
his
case
into
consideration
  
<EOS>
You
see
we
be
fix
for
some
week
at
least
,
and
as
you
have
have
a
long
respite
,
I
hope
you
will
begin
immediately
to
discharge
the
arrear
due
to

<EOS>
my
dear

dear
LETTY

NEVER
do
I
sit
down
to
write
in
such
agitation
as
I
now
feel
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
a
few
day
,
we
have
meet
with
a
number
of
incident
so
wonderful
and
interesting
,
that
all
my
idea
be
throw
into
confusion
and
perplexity
  
<EOS>
You
must
not
expect
either
method
or
coherence
in
what
I
be
go
to
relate
 
my
dear
Willis
.
<EOS>
since
my
last
,
the
aspect
of
affair
be
totally

<EOS>
and
so
changed
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
I
would
fain
give
you
a
regular
detal
  
<EOS>
in
pass
a
river
,
about
eight
day
ago
,
our
coach

and
some
of
us
narrowly
escape
with
life
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
have
well
nigh
perish
  
<EOS>
o
Heaven
,
I
can
not
reflect
upon
that
circumstance
without
horror
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
lose
my
good
friend
,
my
father
and
protector
,
but
for
the
resolution
and
activity
of
his
servant
Humphry
Clinker
,
whom
Providence
really
seem
to
have
place
near
him
for
the
necessity
of
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
not
be
think
superstitious
;
but
surely
he
act
from
a
strong
impulse
than
common
fidelity
  
<EOS>
be
it
not
the
voice
of
nature
that
loudly
call
upon
him
to
save
the
life
of
his
own
father
?
<EOS>
for
,
o
Letty
,
it
be
discover
that
Humphry
Clinker
be
my
uncle
's
natural
son
.
    
<EOS>
almost
at
the
same
instant
,
a
gentleman
,
who
come
to
offer
us
his
assistance
,
and
invite
us
to
his
house
,
turn
out
to
be
a
very
old
friend
of
Mr
Bramble
  
<EOS>
His
name
be
Mr
Dennison
,
one
of
the
worthy
man
live
;
and
his
lady
be
a
perfect
saint
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
They
have
an
only
son
 
who
do
you
think
be
this
only
son
?
  
<EOS>
o
Lety
!
 
<EOS>
o
gracious
heaven
!
<EOS>
how
my
heart
palpitate
,
when
I
tell
you
that
this
only
son
of
Mr
Dennison
,
be
that
very
identical
youth
who
,
under
the
name
of
Wilson
,
have
make
such
ravage
in
my
heart
!
  
<EOS>
yes

and
I
be
now

in
the
same
house
,
and
converse
together
freely
  
His
father
approve
of
his
sentiment
in
my
favour
;
his
father
love
me
with
all
the
tenderness
of
a
parent
,
my
uncle
,
my
aunt
,
and
my
brother
,
no
longer
oppose
my
inclination
  
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
they
have
agree
to
make
us
happy
without
delay
;
and
in
three
week
or
a
month
,
if
no
unforeseen
accident
intervene
,
your
friend
Lydia
Melford
,
will
have
change
her
name
and
condition
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
if
no
accident
intervene
,
because
such
a
torrent
of
success
make
me
tremble
!
  
<EOS>
I
wish
there
may
not
be
something
treacherous
in
this
sudden
reconciliation
of
fortune
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
merit
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
title
to
such
felicity
?
<EOS>
far
from

the
prospect
that
lie
before
me
,
my
mind
be
harass
with
a
continued
tumult
,
make
up
of
hope
and
wish
,
doubt
and
apprehension
  
<EOS>
I
can
neither
eat
nor
sleep
,
and
my
spirit
be
in
perpetual
flutter
.
  
<EOS>
I
more
than
ever
feel
that
vacancy
in
my
heart
,
which
your
presence
alone
can
fill
.
  
<EOS>
the
mind
,
in
every
disquit
,
seek
to
repose
itself
on
the
bosom
of
a
friend
;
and
this
be
such
trial
as
I
really
know
not
how
to
support
without
your
company
and
counsel
  
<EOS>
I
must
therefore
,
dear
Letty
,
put
your
friendship

<EOS>
dear
DICK
,
you
can
not
imagine
what
pleasure
I
have
in
see
your
hand
writing
,
after
such
a
long
cessation
on
your
side
of
our
correspondence
  
<EOS>
yet
Heaven
know
,
<EOS>
I
have
often
see
your
hand
 
writing
with
disgust
  
<EOS>
I
mean
,
when
it
appear
in
abbreviation
of
apothecary
's
Latin
  
<EOS>
I
like
your
hint
of
make
interest
for
the
reversica
of
the
collector
's
place
,
for
Mr
Lismahago
,
who
be
much
pleased
with
the
scheme
,
and
present
you
with
his
compliment
and
good
thank
for
think
<EOS>
so
kind
of
his
concern
  
<EOS>
the
man
seem
to
mend
,
upon
further
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
that
harsh
reserve
,
which
form
a
disagreeable
huik
about
his
character
,
begin
to
peel
off
in
the
course
of
our
communication
  
<EOS>
I
have
great
hope
that
he
and
Tabby
will
be
as
happily
pair
as
any
two
draught
animal
in
the
kingdom
;
and
I
make
no
doubt
,
but
that
he
will
prove
a
valuable
acquisition
to
our
little
society
,
in
the
article
of
conversation
,
by
the
fire
-
side
in
winter
    
<EOS>
Your
objection
to
my
passing
this
season
of
the
year
at
such
a
distance
from
home
would
have
more
weight
if
I
do
not
find
myself
perfectly
at
my
ease
where
I
be
,
and
my
health
so
much
improved
,
that
I
be
dispose
to
bid
defiance
to
gout
and
rheumatism
  
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
I
have
put
my
self
on
the
superannuated
list
too
soon
,
and
absurdly
seek
for
health
in
the
retreat
of
laziness
  
<EOS>
I
be
persuade
that
all
valetudinarian
be
too
sedentary
,
too
regular
,
and
too
cautious
 
<EOS>
we
should
sometimes
increase
the
motion
of
the
machine
,
to
unclog
the
wheel
of
life
;
and
now
and
then
take
a
plunge
amidst
the
wave
of
excess
,
in
order
to
case
-
harden
the
constitution
.
<EOS>
I
have
even
find
a
change
of
company
as
necessary
as
a
change
of
air
,
to
promote
a
vigorous
circulation
of
the
spirit
,
which
be
the
very
essence
and
critertion
of
good
health
.
    
<EOS>
since
my
last
,
I
have
be
perform
the
duty
of
friendship
,
that
require
a
great
deal
of
exercise
,
from
which
I
hope
to
derive
some
benefit
  
understanding
,
by
the
great
accident
in
the
world
,
that
Mr
Baynard
's
wife
be
dangerously
ill
of
a
pleuritic
fever
,
I
borrow
Dennison
's
postchaise
,
and
go
a
-
cross
the
country
to
his
habitation
,
attend
only
by
Loyd
(
quondam
Clinker
)
on
horseback
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
distance
be
not
above
thirty
mile
,
I
arrive
about
four
in
the
afternoon
,
and
meet
the
physician
at
the
door
,
be
inform
that
his
patient
have
just
expire
  
<EOS>
I
be
instantly
.
<EOS>
seize
with
a
violent
emotion
,
but
it
be
not
grief
  
<EOS>
the
family
be
in
confusion
,
I
run
up
stair
into
the
chamber
,
where
,
indeed
,
they
be
all
assemble
  
the
aunt
stand
wring
her
hand
in
a
kind
of
stupefaction
of
sorrow
,
but
my
friend
act
all
the
extravagancy
of
affliction
  
<EOS>
He
hold
the
body
in
his
arm
,
and
pour
forth
such
a
lamentation
,
that
one
would
have
think
he
have
lose
the
most
amiable
consort
and
valuable
companion
upon
earth
.
    
<EOS>
Affection
may
certainly
exist
independant
of
esteem
;
nay
,
the
same
object
may
be
lovely
in
one
respect
,
and
detestable
in
another
  
the
mind
have
a
surprising
faculty
of
accommodate
,
and
even
attach
itself
,
in
such
a
manner
,
by
dint
of
use
to
thing
that
be
in
their
own
nature
disagreeable
and
even
pernicious
,
that
it
can
not
bear
to
be
deliver
from
them
without
reluctance
and
regret
.
<EOS>
Baynard
be
so
absorb
in
his
delirium
,
that
he
do
not
perceive
me
when
I
enter
,
and
desire
one
of
the
woman
to
conduct
the
aunt
into
her
own
chamber
  
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
I
beg
the
tutor
to
withdraw
the
boy
,
who
stand
gape
in
a
corner
,
very
little
affected
with
the
distress
of
the
scene
  
these
step
be
take
.
<EOS>
I
wait
till
the
first
violence
of
my
friend
's
transport
be
abate
,
then
disengage
him
gently
from
the
melancholy
object
,
and
lead
him
by
the
hand
into
another
apartment
;
though
he
struggle
so
hard
,
that
I
be
oblige
to
have
recourse
to
the
assistance
of
his
valet
de
chambre
  
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
,
however
,
he
recollect
himself
,
and
fold
me
in
his
arm

"
this
(
cry
he

be
a
friendly
office
,
indeed

<EOS>
I
know
not
how

I

Heaven
send
you
to
prevent
my

that
love
me
with
such
warmth
and
purity
of
affection
  
my
constant
companion
of
twenty
year
!
  
<EOS>
She
be
go
 
<EOS>
she
be
go
for
ever
!
<EOS>
Heaven
and
earth
!
<EOS>
where
be
she
?
  
<EOS>
death
shall
not
part
us
!
"
    
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
start
up
,
and
could
hardly
be
with
-
hold
from
return
to
the
scene
we
have
quit
  
<EOS>
You
will
perceive
it
would
have
be
very
absurd
for
me
to
argue
with
a
man
that
talk
so
madly
.
  
<EOS>
on
all
such
occasion
,
the
first
torrent
of
passion
must
be
allow
to
subside
gradually
.
  
<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
beguile
his
attention
by
start
little
hint
and
insinuate
other
object
of
discourse
imperceptably
;
and
be
exceedingly
pleased
in
my
own
mind
at
this
event
,
I
exert
myself
with
such
an
extraordinary
flow
of
spirit
as
be
attend
with
success
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
few
hour
,
he
be
calm
enough
to
hear
reason
,
and
even
own
that
Heaven
could
not
have
interpose
more
effectually
to
rescue
him
from
disgrace
and
ruin
  
that
he
may
not
,
however
,
relapse
into
weakness
for
want
of
company
,
I
pass
the
night
in
his
chamber
,
in
a
little
tent
bed
bring
thither
on
purpose
;
and
well
it
be
<EOS>
I
take
this
precaution
,
for
he
start
up
in
bed
several
time
,
and
would
have
play
the
fool
,
if
I
have
not
be
present
.
    
<EOS>
next
day
he
be
in
a
condition
to
talk
of
business
,
and
vest
me
with
full
authority
over
his
household
,
which
I
begin
to
exercise
without
loss
of
time
,
tho
'
not
before
he
know
and
approve
of
the
scheme
I
have
project
for
his
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
have
quit
the
house
immediately
;
but
this
retreat
I
oppose
.
  
<EOS>
far
from
encourage
a
temporary
disgust
,
which
may
degenerate
into
an
habitual
aversion
,
I
resolve
,
if
possible
,
to
attach
him
more
than
ever
to
his
Household
Gods
  
<EOS>
I
give
direction
for
the
funeral
to
be
as
private
as
be
consistent
with
decency
;
I
write
to
London
,
that
an
inventory
and
estimate
may
be
make
of
the
furniture
and
effect
in
his
town
-
house
,
and
give
notice
to
the
landlord
,
that
Mr
Baynard
should
quit
the
premise
at
Lady
-
day
;
I
set
a
person
at
work
to
take
account
of
every
thing
in
the
country
-
house
,
include
horse
,
carriage
,
and
harness
;
I
settle
the
young
gentleman
at
a
boarding
-
school
,
keep
by
a
clergyman
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
thither
<EOS>
he
go
without
reluctance
,
as
soon
as
he
know
that
he
be
to
be
trouble
no
more
with
his
tutor
,
whom
we
dismiss
.
  
<EOS>
the
aunt
continue
very
sullen
,
and
never
appear
at
table
,
though
Mr
Baynard
pay
his
respect
to
her
every
day
in
her
own
chamber
;
there
also
she
hold
conference
with
the
waiting
-
woman
and
other
servant
of
the
family
:
but
,
the
moment
her
niece
be
inter
,
she
go
away
in
a
post
-
chase
prepare
for
that
purpose
:
<EOS>
she
do
not
leave
the
house
,
however
,
without
give
Mr
Baynard
to
understand
,
that
the
wardrobe
of
her
niece
be
the
perquisite
of
her
woman
;
accordingly
that
worthless
drab
receive
all
the
clothe
,
lace
,
and
linen
of
her
deceased
mistress
,
to
the
value
of
five
hundred
pound
,
at
a
moderate
computation
.
    
<EOS>
the
next
step
I
take
be
to
disband
that
legion
of
supernumerary
domestic
,
who
have
prey
so
long
upon
the
vital
of
my
friend
:
a
parcel
of
idle
drones
,
so
intolerably
insolent
,
that
they
even
treat
their
own
master
with
the
most
contemptuous
neglect
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
generally
hire
by
his
wife
,
accord
to
the
recommendation
of
her
woman
,
and
these
be
the
only
patron
to
whom
they
pay
the
least
deference
.
<EOS>
I
have
therefore
uncommon
satisfaction
in
clear
the
house
of
those
vermin
.
<EOS>
the
woman
of
the
deceased
,
and
a
chambermaid
,
a
valet
de
chambre
,
a
butler
,
a
french
cook
,
a
master
gardener
,
two
footman
,
and
a
coachman
,
I
pay
off
,
and
turn
out
of
the
house
immediately
,
pay
to
each
a
month
's
wage
in
lieu
of
warning
.
<EOS>
those
whom
I
retain
,
consist
of
a
female
cook
,
who
have
be
assistant
to
the
Frenchman
,
a
house
-
maid
,
an
old
lacquey
,
a
postilion
,
and
under
-
gardener
.
<EOS>
thus
I
remove
at
once
a
huge
mountain
of
expence
and
care
from
the
shoulder
of
my
friend
,
who
could
hardly
believe
the
evidence
of
his
own
sense
,
when
he
find
himself
so
suddenly
and
effectually
relieve
.
<EOS>
His
heart
,
however
,
be
still
subject
to
vibration
of
tenderness
,
which
return
at
certain
interval
,
extort
sigh
,
and
tear
,
and
exclamation
of
grief
and
impatience
but
these
sit
grow
every
day
less
violent
and
less
frequent
,
till
at
length
his
reason
obtain
a
complete
victory
over
the
infirmity
of
his
nature
.
    
<EOS>
upon
an
accurate
inquiry
into
the
state
of
his
affair
,
I
find
his
debt
amount
to
twenty
thousand
pound
,
for
eighteen
thousand
pound
of
which
sum
his
estate
be
mortgage
;
and
as
he
pay
five
percent
.
<EOS>
interest
,
and
some
of
his
farm
be
unoccupied
,
he
do
not
receive
above
two
hundred
pound
a
year
clear
from
his
land
,
over
and
above
the
interest
of
his
wife
's
fortune
,
which
produce
eight
hundred
pound
annually
.
<EOS>
for
lighten
this
heavy
burden
,
I
devise
the
following
expedient
.
  
<EOS>
His
wife
's
jewel
,
together
with
his
superfluous
plate
and
furniture
in
both
house
,
his
horse
and
carriage
,
which
be
already
advertise
to
be
sell
by
auction
,
will
,
accord
to
the
estimate
,
produce
two
thousand
five
hundred
pound
in
ready
money
,
with
which
the
debt
will
be
immediately
reduce
to
eighteen
thousand
pound
  
I
have
undertake
to
find
him
ten
thousand
pound
at
four
per
cent
.
<EOS>
by
which
mean
he
will
save
one
hundred
a
-
year
in
the
article
of
interest
,
and
perhaps
we
shall
be
able
to
borrow
the
other
eight
thousand
on
the
same
term
.
<EOS>
accord
to
his
own
scheme
of
a
country
life
,
he
say
he
can
live
comfortably
for
three
hundred
pound
a
year
;
but
,
as
he
have
a
son
to
educate
,
he
will
allow
him
five
hundred
;
then
there
will
be
an
accumulating
fund
of
seven
hundred
a
-
year
,
principal
and
interest
,
to
pay
off
the
incumbrance
;
and
,
I
think
,
we
may
modestly
add
three
hundred
,
on
the
presumption
of
new
-
lease
and
improve
the
vacant
farm
:
so
that
,
in
a
couple
of
year
,
I
suppose
there
will
be
above
a
thousand
a
-
year
appropriate
to
liquidate
a
debt
of
sixteen
thousand
.
    
<EOS>
We
forthwith
begin
to
class
and
set
apart
the
article
design
for
sale
,
under
the
direction
of
an
upholder
from
London
;
and
,
that
nobody
in
the
house
may
be
idle
,
commence
our
reformation
without
door
,
as
well
as
within
.
<EOS>
with
Baynard
's
good
leave
,
I
order
the
gardener
to
turn
the
rivulet
into
its
old
channel
to
refresh
the
faint
Naiads
,
who
have
so
long
languish
among
mouldre
root
,
wither
leave
,
and
dry
pebble
.
  
<EOS>
the
shrubbery
be
condemn
to
extirpation
;
and
the
pleasure
ground
will
be
restore
to
its
original
use
of
corn
-
field
and
pasture
.
  
<EOS>
order
be
give
for
rebuild
the
wall
of
the
garden
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
and
for
plant
clump
of
fir
,
intermingle
with
beech
and
chestnut
,
at
the
east
end
,
which
be
now
quite
expose
to
the
surly
blast
that
come
from
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
all
these
work
be
actually
begin
,
and
the
house
and
auction
leave
to
the
care
and
management
of
a
reputable
attorney
,
I
bring
Baynard
along
with
me
in
the
chaise
,
and
make
him
acquaint
with
Dennison
,
whose
goodness
of
heart
would
not
fail
to
engage
his
esteem
and
affection
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
indeed
charm
with
our
society
in
general
,
and
declare
that
he
never
see
the
theory
of
true
pleasure
reduce
to
practice
before
.
  
<EOS>
I
really
believe
it
would
not
be
an
easy
task
to
find
such
a
number
of
individual
assemble
under
one
roof
,
more
happy
than
we
be
at
present
.
    
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
,
however
,
in
confidence
,
I
suspect
Tabby
of
tergiversation
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
be
so
long
accustomed
to
that
original
,
that
I
know
all
the
caprice
of
her
heart
,
and
can
often
perceive
her
design
while
they
be
yet
in
embrio
  
<EOS>
She
attach
herself
to
Lismahago
for
no
other
reason
but
that
she
despair
of
make
a
more
agreeable
conquest
.
  
<EOS>
at
present
,
if
I
be
not
much
mistake
in
my
observation
,
she
would
gladly
convert
the
widowhood
of
Baynard
to
her
own
advantage
  
since
he
arrive
,
she
have
behave
very
coldly
to
the
captain
,
and
strove
to
fasten
on
the
other
's
heart
,
with
the
hook
of
overstrain
civility
.
  
<EOS>
these
must
be
the
instinctive
effort
of
her
constitution
,
rather
than
the
effect
of
any
deliberate
design
;
for
matter
be
carry
to
such
a
length
with
the
lieutenant
,
that
she
could
not
retract
with
any
regard
to
conscience
or
reputation
.
<EOS>
besides
,
she
will
meet
with
nothing
but
indifference
or
aversion
on
the
side
of
Baynard
,
who
have
too
much
sense
to
think
of
such
a
partner
at
any
time
,
and
too
much
delicacy
to
admit
a
thought
of
any
such
connexion
at
the
present
juncture
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
I
have
prevail
upon
her
to
let
him
have
four
thousand
pound
at
four
per
cent
.
<EOS>
towards
pay
of
his
mortgage
.
<EOS>
Young
Dennison
have
agree
that
Liddy
's
fortune
shall
be
appropriate
to
the
same
purpose
,
on
the
same
term
.
  
<EOS>
His
father
will
fall
out
three
thousand
pound
stock
for
his
accommodation
.
  
<EOS>
Farmer
Bland
have
,
at
the
desire
of
Wilson
,
undertake
for
two
thousand
;
and
I
must
make
an
effort
to
advance
what
further
will
be
require
to
take
my
friend
out
of
the
hand
of
the
Philistines
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
pleased
with
the
improvement
make
on
his
estate
,
which
be
all
cultivate
like
a
garden
,
that
he
have
enter
himself
as
a
pupil
in
farming
to
Mr
Dennison
,
and
resolve
to
attach
himself
wholly
to
the
practice
of
husbandry
.
    
<EOS>
every
thing
be
now
prepared
for
our
double
wedding
.
<EOS>
the
marriage
-
article
for
both
couple
be
draw
and
execute
;
and
the
ceremony
only
wait
until
the
party
shall
have
be
resident
in
the
parish
the
term
prescribe
by
law
.
<EOS>
Young
Dennison
betray
some
symptom
of
impatience
;
but
,
Lismahago
bear
this
necessary
delay
with
the
temper
of
a
philosopher
.
  
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
the
captain
do
not
stand
altogether
on
the
foundation
of
personal
merit
.
<EOS>
besides
his
half
-
pay
,
amount
to
two
and
forty
pound
a
year
,
this
indefatigable
oeconomist
have
amass
eight
hundred
pound
which
he
have
secure
in
the
fund
.
<EOS>
this
sum
arise
partly
from
his
pay
be
run
up
while
he
remain
among
the
indians
;
partly
from
what
he
receive
as
a
consideration
for
the
difference
between
his
full
appointment
and
the
half
-
pay
,
to
which
he
be
now
restrict
;
and
partly
from
the
profit
of
a
little
traffic
he
drive
in
peltry
,
during
his
fachemship
among
the
Miamis
.
    
<EOS>
Liddy
's
fear
and
perplexity
have
be
much
assuage
by
the
company
of
one
Miss
Willis
,
who
have
be
her
intimate
companion
at
the
boarding
-
school
.
<EOS>
Her
parent
have
be
earnestly
solicit
to
allow
her
make
this
friendly
visit
on
such
an
extraordinary
occasion
;
and
two
day
ago
she
arrive
with
her
mother
,
who
do
not
choose
that
she
should
come
without
a
proper
governante
.
<EOS>
the
young
lady
be
very
sprightly
,
handsome
,
and
agreeable
,
and
the
mother
<EOS>
a
mighty
good
sort
of
a
woman
;
so
that
their
coming
add
considerably
to
our
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
but
we
shall
have
a
third
couple
yoke
in
the
matrimonial
chain
.
<EOS>
Mr
Clinker
Loyd
have
make
humble
remonstrance
,
through
the
canal
of
my
nephew
,
set
forth
the
sincere
love
and
affection
mutually
subsist
between
him
and
Mrs
Winifred
Jenkins
,
and
pray
my
consent
to
their
come
together
for
life
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
wish
that
Mr
Clinker
have
keep
out
of
this
scrape
;
but
as
the
nymph
's
happiness
be
at
stake
,
and
she
have
have
already
some
fit
in
the
way
of
despondence
,
I
,
in
order
to
prevent
any
tragical
catastrophe
,
have
give
him
leave
to
play
the
fool
,
in
imitation
of
his
better
;
and
I
suppose
we
shall
in
time
have
a
whole
litter
of
his
progeny
at
Brambleton
-
hall
.
<EOS>
the
fellow
be
stout
and
lusty
,
very
sober
and
conscientious
;
and
the
wench
seem
to
be
as
great
an
enthusiast
in
love
as
in
religion
.
    
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
think
of
employ
him
some
other
way
,
that
the
parish
may
not
be
overstock
  
<EOS>
you
know
he
have
be
breed
a
farrier
,
consequently
belong
to
the
faculty
;
and
as
he
be
very
docile
,
I
make
no
doubt
but
,
with
your
good
instruction
,
he
may
be
,
in
a
little
time
,
qualified
to
act
as
a
Welch
apothecary
.
<EOS>
tabby
who
never
do
a
favour
with
a
good
grace
,
have
consent
,
with
great
reluctance
,
to
this
match
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
hurt
her
pride
,
as
she
now
consider
Clinker
,
in
the
light
of
a
relation
;
but
,
I
believe
,
her
objection
be
of
a
more
selfish
nature
.
<EOS>
She
declare
she
can
not
think
of
retain
the
wife
of
Mathew
Loyd
in
the
character
of
a
servant
;
and
she
foresee
,
that
on
such
an
occasion
the
woman
will
expect
some
gratification
for
her
past
service
.
<EOS>
as
for
Clinker
,
exclusive
of
other
consideration
,
he
be
so
trusty
,
brave
,
affectionate
,
and
alert
,
and
I
owe
him
such
personal
obligation
,
that
he
merit
more
than
all
the
indulgence
that
can
possibly
be
shew

near
a
close
;
and
the
curtain
be
ready
to
drop
:
but
,
the
latter
scene
of
this
act
I
shall
recapitulate
in
order
.
  
<EOS>
about
a
fortnight
ago
,
my
uncle
make
an
excursion
a
cross
the
country
,
and
bring
hither
a
particular
friend
,
one
Mr
Baynard
,
who
have
just
lose
his
wife
,
and
be
for
some
time
disconsolate
,
though
by
all
account
he
have
much
more
cause
for
joy
than
for
sorrow
at
this
event
.
  
<EOS>
His
countenance
,
however
,
clear
up
apace
;
and
he
appear
to
be
a
person
of
rare
accomplishment
.
  
<EOS>
but
we
have
receive
another
still
more
agreeable
reinforcement
to
our
company
,
by
the
arrival
of
Miss
Willis
from
Gloucester
.
<EOS>
She
be
Liddy
's
bosom
friend
at
the
boarding
-
school
,
and
be
earnestly
solicit
to
assist
at
the
nuptial
,
her
mother
be
so
obliging
as
to
grant
my
sister
's
request
,
and
even
to
come
with
her
in
person
.
<EOS>
Liddy
,
accompany
by
George
Dennison
and
me
,
give
them
the
meeting
half
-
way
,
and
next
day
conduct
them
hither
in
safety
.
<EOS>
Miss
Willis
be
a
charming
girl
,
and
,
in
point
of
disposition
,
an
agreeable
contrast
to
my
sister
,
who
be
rather
too
grave
and
sentimental
for
my
turn
of
mind
  
<EOS>
the
other
be
gay
,
frank
,
a
little
giddy
,
and
always
good
-
humoured
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
moreover
,
a
genteel
fortune
,
be
well
bear
,
and
remarkably
handsome
.
  
<EOS>
ah
Phillips
!
<EOS>
if
these
quality
be
permanent
if
her
humour
would
never
change
,
nor
her
beauty
decay
,
what
effort
would
I
not
make
  
but
these
be
idle
reflection
  
<EOS>
my
destiny
must
one
day
be
fulfil
.
    
<EOS>
at
present
we
pass
the
time
as
agreeably
as
we
can
  
We
have
get
up
several
farce
which
afford
unspeakable
entertainment
by
the
effect
they
produce
among
the
country
people
,
who
be
admit
to
all
our
exhibition
  
<EOS>
two
night
ago
Jack
Wilson
acquire
great
applause
in
Harlequin
Skeleton
,
and
Lismahago
surprize
us
all
in
the
character
of
Pierot
.
  
<EOS>
His
long
lank
side
,
and
strong
marked
feature
,
be
all
peculiarly
adapt
to
his
part
.
  
<EOS>
He
appear
with
a
ludicrous
stare
,
from
which
he
have
discharge
all
meaning
:
he
adopt
the
impression
of
fear
and
amazement
so
naturally
,
that
many
of
the
audience
be
infect
by
his
look
;
but
when
the
skeleton
hold
him
in
chase
,
his
horror
become
most
divertingly
picturesque
,
and
seem
to
endow
him
with
such
praeternatural
agility
as
confound
all
the
spectator
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
lively
representation
of
death
in
pursuit
of
consumption
,
and
have
such
an
effect
upon
the
commonalty
,
that
some
of
them
shriek
aloud
,
and
other
run
out
of
the
hall
in
the
utmost
consternation
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
not
the
only
instance
in
which
the
lieutenant
have
already
excite
our
wonder
.
<EOS>
His
temper
which
have
be
sour
and
shrivel
by
disappointment
and
chagrin
,
be
now
swell
out
,
and
smooth
like
a
raisin
in
plum
-
porridge
.
<EOS>
from
be
reserve
and
punctilious
,
he
be
become
easy
and
obliging
.
<EOS>
He
crack
joke
,
laugh
and
banter
with
the
most
facetious
familiarity
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
enter
into
all
our
scheme
of
merriment
and
pastime
  
<EOS>
the
other
day
his
baggage
arrive
in
the
waggon
from
London
,
contain
in
two
large
trunk
and
a
long
deal
box
not
unlike
a
coffin
.
<EOS>
the
trunk
be
fill
with
his
wardrobe
,
which
he
display
for
the
entertainment
of
the
company
,
and
he
freely
own
,
that
it
consist
chiefly
of
the
opima
spolia
take
in
battle
.
<EOS>
what
he
select
for
his
wedding
suit
,
be
a
tarnished
white
cloth
face
with
blue
velvet
,
embroider
with
silver
;
but
,
he
value
himself
most
upon
a
tye
-
periwig
,
in
which
he
have
make
his
first
appearance
as
a
lawyer
above
thirty
year
ago
.
<EOS>
this
machine
have
be
in
buckle
ever
since
,
and
now
all
the
servant
in
the
family
be
employ
to
frizz
it
out
for
the
occasion
,
which
be
yesterday
celebrate
at
the
parish
church
.
<EOS>
George
Dennison
and
his
bride
be
distinguish
by
nothing
extraordinary
in
their
apparel
.
<EOS>
His
eye
lighten
with
eagerness
and
joy
,
and
she
tremble
with
coyness
and
confusion
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
give
her
away
,
and
her
friend
Willis
support
her
during
the
ceremony
.
    
<EOS>
but
my
aunt
and
her
paramour
take
the
pas
,
and
form
,
indeed
,
such
a
pair
of
original
,
as
,
I
believe
,
all
England
could
not
parallel
.
<EOS>
She
be
dress
in
the
stile
of
1739
;
and
the
day
be
cold
,
put
on
a
manteel
of
green
velvet
lace
with
gold
;
but
this
be
take
off
by
the
bridegroom
,
who
throw
over
her
shoulder
a
fur
cloak
of
american
fable
,
value
at
four
score
guinea
,
a
present
equally
agreeable
and
unexpected
.
<EOS>
thus
accoutre
,
she
be
lead
up
to
the
altar
by
Mr
Dennison
,
who
do
the
office
of
her
father
:
<EOS>
Lismahago
advance
in
the
military
step
with
his
french
coat
reach
no
farther
than
the
middle
of
his
thigh
,
his
campaign
wig
that
surpasse
all
description
,
and
a
languishing
leer
upon
his
countenance
,
in
which
there
seem
to
be
something
arch
and
ironical
.
<EOS>
the
ring
,
which
he
put
upon
her
finger
,
he
have
conceal
till
the
moment
it
be
use
.
<EOS>
He
now
produce
it
with
an
air
of
self
-
complacency
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
curious
antique
,
set
with
rose
diamond
;
he
tell
us
afterwards
,
it
have
be
in
his
family
two
hundred
year
,
and
be
a
present
from
his
grandmother
.
<EOS>
these
circumstance
agreeably
flatter
the
pride
of
our
aunt
Tabitha
,
which
have
already
find
uncommon
gratification
in
the
captain
's
generosity
;
for
he
have
,
in
the
morning
,
present
my
uncle
with
a
fine
bear
's
skin
,
and
a
spanish
fowling
-
piece
,
and
me
with
a
case
of
pistol
curiously
mount
with
silver
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
he
give
Mrs
Jenkins
an
indian
purse
,
make
of
silk
grass
,
contain
twenty
crown
piece
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
this
young
lady
,
with
the
assistance
of
Mr
Loyd
,
form
the
third
couple
who
yesterday
sacrifice
to
Hymen
.
<EOS>
I
write
to
you
in
my
last
,
that
he
have
recourse
to
my
mediation
,
which
I
employ
successfully
with
my
uncle
;
but
Mrs
Tabitha
hold
out
till
the
love
-
sick
Jenkins
have
two
fit
of
the
mother
;
then
she
relent
,
and
those
two
cooing
turtle
be
cage
for
life
  
<EOS>
Our
aunt
make
an
effort
of
generosity
in
furnish
the
bride
with
her
superflutie
of
clothe
and
linen
,
and
her
example
be
follow
by
my
sister
;
nor
do
Mr
Bramble
<EOS>
and
I
neglect
her
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
indeed
,
a
day
of
peace
offering
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dennison
insist
upon
Liddy
's
accept
two
bank
note
of
one
hundred
pound
each
,
as
pocket
-
money
;
and
his
lady
give
her
a
diamond
necklace
of
double
that
value
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
besides
,
a
mutual
exchange
of
token
among
the
individual
of
the
two
family
thus
happily
unite
    
<EOS>
as
George
Dennison
and
his
partner
be
judge
improper
object
of
mirth
,
Jack
Wilson
have
resolve
to
execute
some
joke
on
Lismahago
,
and
after
supper
begin
to
ply
him
with
bumper
,
when
the
lady
have
retire
;
but
the
captain
perceive
his
drift
,
beg
for
quarter
,
alledge
that
the
adventure
,
in
which
he
have
engage
,
be
a
very
serious
matter
;
and
that
it
would
be
more
the
part
of
a
good
Christian
to
pray
that
he
may
be
strengthen
,
than
to
impede
his
endeavour
to
finish
the
adventure
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
spare
accordingly
,
and
permit
to
ascend
the
nuptial
couch
with
all
his
sense
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
there
he
and
his
consort
sit
in
state
,
like
Saturn
and
Cybele
,
while
the
benediction
-
posset
be
drink
;
and
a
cake
be
break
over
the
head
of
Mrs
Tabitha
Lismahago
,
the
fragment
be
distribute
among
the
bystander
,
accord
to
the
custom
of
the
antient
briton
,
on
the
supposition
that
every
person
who
eat
of
this
hallowed
cake
,
should
that
night
have
a
vision
of
the
man
or
woman
whom
Heaven
design
<EOS>
should
be
his
or
her
wedded
mate
.
    
<EOS>
the
weight
of
Wilson
's
waggery
fall
upon
honest
Humphry
and
his
spouse
,
who
be
bed
in
an
upper
room
,
with
the
usual
ceremony
of
throw
the
stocking
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
perform
,
and
the
company
withdraw
,
a
sort
of
catterwauling
ensue
,
when
Jack
find
mean
to
introduce
a
real
cat
shod
with
walnut
-
shell
,
which
gallop
along
the
board
,
make
such
a
dreadful
noise
as
effectually
discompose
our
lover
.
  
<EOS>
Winifried
scream
aloud
,
and
shrink
under
the
bed
-
cloath
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Loyd
,
believe
that
Satan
be
come
to
buffet
him
in
propria
persona
,
lay
aside
all
carnal
thought
,
and
begin
to
pray
aloud
with
great
fervency
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
,
the
poor
animal
,
be
more
afraid
than
either
,
leap
into
the
bed
,
and
meaule
with
the
most
piteous
exclamation
.
  
<EOS>
Loyd
,
thus
inform
of
the
nature
of
the
annoyance
,
rise
and
set
the
door
wide
open
,
so
that
this
troublesome
visitan
retreat
with
great
expedition
;
then
secure
himself
,
by
mean
of
a
double
bolt
,
from
a
second
intrusion
,
he
be
leave
to
enjoy
his
good
fortune
without
further
disturbance
.
    
<EOS>
if
one
may
judge
from
the
look
of
the
party
,
they
be
all
very
well
satisfied
with
what
have
pass
,
  
george
Dennison
and
his
wife
be
too
delicate
to
exhibit
any
strong
-
mark
sign
of
their
mutual
satisfaction
,
but
their
eye
be
sufficiently
expressive
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
Lismahago
be
rather
fulsome
in
signify
her
approbation
of
the
captain
's
love
;
while
his
deportment
be
the
very
pink
of
gallantry
,
  
He
sigh
,
and
ogle
,
and
languish
at
this
amiable
object
;
kiss
her
hand
,
mutter
ejaculation
of
rapture
,
and
sings
tender
air
;
and
,
no
doubt
,
laugh
internally
at
her
folly
in
believe
him
sincere
.
  
<EOS>
in
order
to
shew
how
little
his
vigour
be
impair
by
the
fatigue
of
the
proceeding
day
,
he
this
morning
dance
a
Highland
saraband
over
a
naked
back
-
sword
,
and
leap
so
high
,
that
I
believe
he
would
make
no
contemptible
figure
as
a
vaulter
at
Sadler
's
well
  
<EOS>
Mr
Matthew
Loyd
,
when
ask
how
he
relish
his
bargain
,
throw
up
his
eye
,
cry
,
"
for
what
we
have
receive
,
Lord
make
us
thankful
:
amen
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
helpmate
giggle
,
and
hold
her
hand
before
her
eye
,
affect
to
be
ashamed
of
have
be
in
bed
with
a
man
.
  
<EOS>
thus
all
these
widgeon
enjoy
the
novelty
of
their
situation
;
but
,
perhaps
their
note
will
be
change
,
when
they
be
better
acquaint
with
the
nature
of
the
decoy
.
    
<EOS>
as
Mrs
Willis
can
not
be
persuade
to
stay
,
and
Liddy
be
engage
by
promise
to
accompany
her
daughter
back
to
Gloucester
,
I
fancy
there
will
be
a
general
migration
from
hence
,
and
that
most
of
us
will
spend
the
Christmas
holiday
at
Bath
;
in
which
case
,
I
shall
certainly
find
an
opportunity
to
beat
up
your
quarter
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
I
suppose
,
you
be
sick
of
alma
mater
,
and
even
ready
to
execute
that
scheme
of
peregrination
,
which
be
last
year
concert
between
you
and
    
your
affectionate
J
Melford
.
    
<EOS>
November
8
.
    
<EOS>
to
Dr
Lewis
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
DOCTOR
,
   
my
niece
Liddy
be
now
happily
settle
for
life
;
and
captain
Lismahago
have
take
Tabby
off
my
hand
;
so
that
I
have
nothing
further
to
do
,
but
to
comfort
my
friend
Baynard
,
and
provide
for
my
son
Loyd
,
who
be
also
fairly
join
to
Mrs
<EOS>
Winifred
Jenkins
  
<EOS>
You
be
an
excellent
genious
at
hint
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Arbuthnot
be
but
a
type
of
Dr
Lewis
in
that
respect
.
  
<EOS>
what
you
observe
of
the
vestry
-
clerk
deserve
consideration
.
  
<EOS>
I
make
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
Matthew
Loyd
be
well
enough
qualify
for
the
office
;
but
,
at
present
,
you
must
find
room
for
him
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
His
incorruptible
honesty
and
indefatigable
care
will
be
serviceable
in
superintend
the
oeconomy
of
my
farm
;
tho
'
I
do
not
mean
that
he
will
interfere
with
Bayns
,
of
whom
I
have
no
cause
to
complain
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
just
return
with
Baynard
,
from
a
second
trip
to
his
house
,
where
every
thing
be
regulate
to
his
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
not
,
however
,
review
the
apartment
without
tear
and
lamentation
,
so
that
he
be
not
yet
in
a
condition
to
be
leave
alone
;
therefore
I
will
not
part
with
him
till
the
spring
,
when
he
intend
to
plunge
into
the
avocation
of
husbandry
,
which
will
at
once
employ
and
amuse
his
attention
.
  
<EOS>
Charles
Dennison
have
promise
to
stay
with
him
a
fortnight
,
to
set
him
fairly
afloat
in
his
improvement
;
and
Jack
Wilson
will
see
him
from
time
to
time
;
besides
he
have
a
few
friend
in
the
country
,
whom
his
new
plan
of
life
will
not
exclude
from
his
society
.
  
<EOS>
in
less
than
a
year
I
make
no
doubt
but
he
will
find
himself
perfectly
at
ease
both
in
his
mind
and
body
,
for
the
one
have
dangerously
affect
the
other
;
and
I
shall
enjoy
the
exquisite
pleasure
of
see
my
friend
rescue
from
misery
and
contempt
    
<EOS>
Mrs
:
Willis
be
determine
to
return
with
her
daughter
,
in
a
few
day
,
to
Gloucester
,
our
plan
have
undergo
some
alteration
.
  
<EOS>
Jery
have
persuade
his
brother
-
in
-
law
to
carry
his
wife
to
Bath
;
and
I
believe
his
parent
will
accompany
him
thither
.
  
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
have
no
intention
to
take
that
route
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
something
very
extraordinary
that
will
induce
me
to
revisit
either
Bath
or
London
.
<EOS>
My
sister
and
her
husband
,
Baynard
and
I
,
will
take
leave
of
them
at
Gloucester
,
and
make
