how

,
of
break

and
ruin
hope
,
too
often
of
unrelieved
wretchedness
and
successful
knavery
,

<EOS>
a
poor
man
,
with
small
earning
,
and
a
large
family
,
just
manage
to
live
on
from
hand
to
mouth

and
to

from

he
have
barely

the

craving
of
nature

and

His

he

<EOS>
His
good

distrain
,
his

cold
and
hunger
,
and
the
very
bed
on
which
his
sick
wife
be
lie
,
be
drag
from
beneath
her
.
 
<EOS>
what
can

<EOS>
to
whom
be

to
apply
for
relief
?
 
<EOS>
to

?
 
<EOS>
to

?
 
<EOS>
certainly
not
---
there
be
his
parish
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
parish
vestry
,
the
parish
infirmary
,
the
parish
surgeon
,
the
parish
officer
,
the
parish
beadle
.
 
<EOS>
excellent
institution
,
and
gentle
,
kind
-
hearted
man
.
 
<EOS>
the
woman
die
---
she
be
bury
by
the
parish
.
<EOS>
the
child
have
no
protector
---
they

of
by
the

.
 
<EOS>
the
man
first
neglect
,
and
afterwards
can
not
obtain
,
work
<EOS>
---
he
be

and
when
distress
and

have
do
their
work
upon
him
,
he
be
maintain
,
a
harmless
babbling
idiot
,
in
the
parish
asylum
.
   
<EOS>
the
parish
beadle
be
one
of
the
most
,
perhaps
the
most
,
important
member
of
 
the
local
administration
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
so
well
off
as
the
churchwarden
,
certainly
,
nor
be
he
so
learn
as
the
vestry
-
clerk
,
nor
do
he
order
thing
quite
so
much
his
own
way
as
either
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
power
be
very
great
,
notwithstanding
;
and
the
dignity
of
his
office
be
never
impair
by
the
absence
of
effort
on
his
part
to
maintain
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
beadle
of
our
parish
be
a
splendid
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
quite
delightful
to
hear
him
,
as
he
explain
the
state
of
the
exist
poor
law
to
the
deaf
old
woman
in
the
board
-
room
passage
on
business
night
;
and
to
hear
what
he
say
to
the
senior
churchwarden
,
and
what
the
senior
churchwarden
say
to
him
;
and
what
"
we
"
(
the
beadle
and
the
other
gentleman
)
come
to
the
determination
of
do
.
 
<EOS>
a
miserable

look
woman

call
into

boardroom
,
and
represent
a
case
of
extreme
destitution
,
affect
herself
---
a

with
six
small
child
.
 
<EOS>
"
where

<EOS>
"
inquire

a
note
of

"
I
will
send
Simmons
,
the
beadle
,
to

morrow
morning
,
to
ascertain
whether
your

correct
;
and
if
so

I
suppose

have

order
into

Simmons
<EOS>

go
to
this

the

will
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
Simmons
bow
assent
,
and
usher
the
woman
out
.
<EOS>
Her
previous
admiration
of
"
the
board
"
(
who
all
sit
behind
great
book
,
and
with
their
hat
on
)
fade
into
nothing
before
her
respect
for
her
lace
-
trim
conductor
;
and
her
account
of
what
have
pass
inside
,
increase
---
if
that
be
possible
---
the
mark
of
respect
,
show
by
the
assemble
crowd
,
to
that
solemn
functionary
.
<EOS>
as
to
take
out
a
summon
,
it
be
quite
a
hopeless
case
if
simmon
attend
it
,
on
behalf
of
the
parish
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
all
the
title
of
the
Lord
Mayor
by
heart
;
state
the
case
without
a
single
stammer
:
and
it
be
even
report
that
on
one
occasion
he
venture
to
make
a
joke
,
which
the
Lord
Mayor
's
head
footman
(
who
happen
to
be
present
)
<EOS>
afterwards
tell
an
intimate
friend
,
confidentially
,
be
almost
equal
to
one
of
Mr
Hobler
's
.
   
<EOS>
see
him
again
on
Sunday
in
his
state
-
coat
and
cock
-
hat
,
with
a
large
-
head
staff
for
show
in
his
left
hand
,
and
a
small
cane
for
use
in
his
right
.
 
<EOS>
how
pompously
he
marshal
the
child
into
their
place
!
<EOS>
and
how
demurely
the
little
urchin
look
at
him
askance
as
he
survey
them
when
they
be
all
seated
,
with
a
glare
of
the
eye
peculiar
to
beadle
!
<EOS>
the
churchwarden
and
overseer
be
duly
instal
in
their
curtained
pew
,
he
seat
himself
on
a
mahogany
bracket
,
erect
expressly
for
him
at
the
top
of
the
aisle
,
and
divide
his
attention
between
his
prayer
-
book
and
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
,
just
at
the
commencement
of
the
communion
service
,
when
the
whole
congregation
be
hush
into
a
profound
silence
,
break
only
by
the
voice
of
the
officiate
clergyman
,
a
penny
be
hear
to
ring
on
the
stone
floor
of
the
aisle
with
astounding
clearness
.
 
<EOS>
observe
the
generalship
of
the
beadle
.
 
<EOS>
His
involuntary
look
of
horror
be
instantly
change
into
one
of
perfect
indifference
,
as
if
he
be
the
only
person
present
who
have
not
hear
the
noise
.
 
<EOS>
the
artifice
succeed
.
 
<EOS>
after
put
forth
his
right
leg
now
and
then
,
as
a
feeler
,
the
victim
who
drop
the
money
venture
to
make
one
or
two
distinct
dive
after
it
;
and
the
beadle
,
glide
softly
round
,
salute
his
little
round
head
,
when
it
again
appear
above
the
seat
,
with
diver
double
knock
,
administer
with
the
cane
before
notice
,
to
the
intense
delight
of
three
young
man
in
an
adjacent
pew
,
who
cough
violently
at
interval
until
the
conclusion
of
the
sermon
.
   
<EOS>
such
be
a
few
trait
of
the
importance
and
gravity
of
a
parish
beadle
---
a
gravity
which
have
never
be
disturb
in
any
case
that
have
come
under
our
observation
,
except
when
the
service
of
that
particularly
useful
machine
,
a
parish
fire
-
engine
,
be
require
:
then
indeed
all
be
bustle
.
 
<EOS>
two
little
boy
run
to
the
beadle
as
fast
as
their
leg
will
carry
them
,
and
report
from
their
own
personal
observation
that
some
neighbour
chimney
be
on
fire
;
the
engine
be
hastily
get
out
,
and
a
plentiful
supply
of
boy
be
obtain
,
and
harness
to
it
with
rope
,
away
they
rattle
over
the
pavement
,
the
beadle
,
run
<EOS>
---
we
do
not
exaggerate
---
run
at
the
side
,
until
they
arrive
at
some
house
,
smell
strongly
of
soot
,
at
the
door
of
which
the
beadle
knock
with
considerable
gravity
for
half
-
an
-
hour
.
 
<EOS>
no
attention
be
pay
to
these
manual
application
,
and
the
turn
-
cock
have
turn
on
the
water
,
the
engine
turn
off
amidst
the
shout
of
the
boy
;
it
pull
up
once
more
at
the
work
-
house
,
and
the
beadle
"
pull
up
"
the
unfortunate
householder
next
day
,
for
the
amount
of
his
legal
reward
.
 
<EOS>
We
never
see
a
parish
engine
at
a
regular
fire
but
once
.
 
<EOS>
It
come
up
in
gallant
style
---
three
mile
and
a
half
an
hour
,
<EOS>
at
least
;
there
be
a
capital
supply
of
water
,
and
it
be
first
on
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
Bang
go
the
pump
---
the
people
cheer
<EOS>
---
the
beadle
perspire
profusely
;
but
it
be
unfortunately
discover
,
just
as
they
be
go
to
put
the
fire
out
,
that
nobody
understand
the
process
by
which
the
engine
be
fill
with
water
;
and
that
eighteen
boy
,
and
a
man
,
have
exhaust
themselves
in
pump
for
twenty
minute
,
without
produce
the
slight
effect
!
   
<EOS>
the
personage
next
in
importance
to
the
beadle
,
be
the
master
of
the
workhouse
and
the
parish
schoolmaster
.
 
<EOS>
the
vestry
-
clerk
,
as
everybody
know
,
be
a
short
,
pudgy
little
man
,
in
black
,
with
a
thick
gold
watch
-
chain
of
considerable
length
,
terminate
in
two
large
seal
and
a
key
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
an
attorney
,
and
generally
in
a
bustle
;
at
no
time
more
so
,
than
when
he
be
hurry
to
some
parochial
meeting
,
with
his
glove
crumple
up
in
one
hand
,
and
a
large
red
book
under
the
other
arm
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
churchwarden
and
overseer
,
we
exclude
them
altogether
,
because
all
we
know
of
them
be
,
that
they
be
usually
respectable
tradesman
,
who
wear
hat
with
brim
inclined
to
flatness
,
and
who
occasionally
testify
in
gilt
letter
on
a
blue
ground
,
in
some
conspicuous
part
of
the
church
,
to
the
important
fact
of
a
gallery
have
be
enlarge
and
beautify
,
or
an
organ
rebuilt
.
   
<EOS>
the
master
of
the
workhouse
be
not
,
in
our
parish
---
nor
be
he
usually
in
any
other
---
one
of
that
class
of
man
the
well
part
of
whose
existence
have
pass
away
,
and
who
drag
out
the
remainder
in
some
inferior
situation
,
with
just
enough
thought
of
the
past
,
to
feel
degraded
by
,
and
discontent
with
the
present
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
unable
to
guess
precisely
to
our
own
satisfaction
what
station
the
man
can
have
occupy
before
;
we
should
think
he
have
be
an
inferior
sort
of
attorney
's
clerk
,
or
else
the
master
of
a
national
school
<EOS>
---
whatever
he
be
,
it
be
clear
his
present
position
be
a
change
for
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
His
income
be
small
certainly
,
as
the
rusty
black
coat
and
threadbare
velvet
collar
demonstrate
:
 
but
then
he
live
free
of
house
-
rent
,
have
a
limited
allowance
of
coal
and
candle
,
and
an
almost
unlimited
allowance
of
authority
in
his
petty
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
tall
,
thin
,
bony
man
;
always
wear
shoe
and
black
cotton
stocking
with
his
surtout
;
and
eye
you
,
as
you
pass
his
parlour
-
window
,
as
if
he
wish
you
be
a
pauper
,
just
to
give
you
a
speciman
of
his
power
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
an
admirable
speciman
of
a
small
tyrant
:
 
morose
,
brutish
,
and
ill
-
temper
;
bully
to
his
inferior
,
cringe
to
his
superior
,
and
jealous
of
the
influence
and
authority
of
the
beadle
.
   
<EOS>
Our
schoolmaster
be
just
the
very
reverse
of
this
amiable
official
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
one
of
those
man
one
occasionally
hear
of
,
on
whom
misfortune
seem
to
have
set
her
mark
;
nothing
he
ever
do
,
or
be
concern
in
,
appear
to
have
prosper
.
 
<EOS>
a
rich
old
relation
who
have
bring
him
up
,
and
openly
announce
his
intention
of
provide
for
him
,
leave
him
10,000l.
in
his
will
,
and
revoke
the
bequest
in
a
codicil
.
 
<EOS>
thus
unexpectedly
reduce
to
the
necessity
of
provide
for
himself
,
he
procure
a
situation
in
a
public
office
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
clerk
below
him
,
die
off
as
if
there
be
a
plague
among
them
;
but
the
old
fellow
over
his
head
,
for
the
reversion
of
whose
place
he
be
anxiously
wait
,
live
on
and
on
,
as
if
they
be
immortal
.
 
<EOS>
He
speculate
and
lose
.
 
<EOS>
He
speculate
again
and
win
---
but
never
get
his
money
.
 
<EOS>
His
talent
be
great
;
his
disposition
,
easy
,
generous
and
liberal
.
 
<EOS>
His
friend
profit
by
the
one
,
and
abuse
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
loss
succeed
loss
;
misfortune
crowd
on
misfortune
;
each
successive
day
bring
him
nearer
the
verge
of
hopeless
penury
,
and
the
quondam
friend
who
have
be
warm
in
their
profession
,
grow
strangely
cold
and
indifferent
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
child
whom
he
love
,
and
a
wife
on
whom
he
dote
.
 
<EOS>
the
former
turn
their
back
on
him
;
the
latter
die
break
-
hearted
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
with
the
stream
<EOS>
---
it
have
ever
be
his
failing
,
and
he
have
not
courage
sufficient
to
bear
up
against
so
many
shock
---
he
have
never
care
for
himself
,
and
the
only
be
who
have
care
for
him
,
in
his
poverty
and
distress
,
be
spare
to
him
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
at
this
period
that
he
apply
for
parochial
relief
.
 
<EOS>
some
kind
-
hearted
man
who
have
know
him
in
happy
time
,
chance
to
be
churchwarden
that
year
,
and
through
his
interest
he
be
appoint
to
his
present
situation
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
an
old
man
now
.
 
<EOS>
of
the
many
who
once
crowd
round
him
in
all
the
hollow
friendship
of
boon
-
companionship
,
some
have
die
,
some
have
fall
like
himself
,
some
have
prosper
---
all
have
forget
him
.
 
<EOS>
Time
and
misfortune
have
mercifully
be
permit
to
impair
his
memory
,
and
use
have
habituate
him
to
his
present
condition
.
 
<EOS>
Meek
,
uncomplaining
,
and
zealous
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
<EOS>
,
he
have
be
allow
to
hold
his
situation
long
beyond
the
usual
period
;
and
he
will
no
doubt
continue
to
hold
it
,
until
infirmity
render
him
incapable
,
or
death
release
him
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
grey
-
head
old
man
feebly
pace
up
and
down
the
sunny
side
of
the
little
court
-
yard
between
school
hour
,
it
would
be
difficult
,
indeed
,
for
the
most
intimate
of
his
former
friend
to
recognise
their
once
gay
and
happy
associate

<EOS>
We
commence
our
last
chapter
with
the
beadle
of
our
parish
,
because
we
be
deeply
sensible
of
the
importance
and
dignity
of
his
office
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
begin
the
present
,
with
the
clergyman
.
 
<EOS>
Our
curate
be
a
young
gentleman
of
such
prepossessing
appearance
,
and
fascinating
manner
,
that
within
one
month
after
his
first
appearance
in
the
parish
,
half
the
young
-
lady
inhabitant
be
melancholy
with
religion
,
and
the
other
half
,
despond
with
love
.
<EOS>
never
be
so
many
young
lady
see
in
our
parish
church
on
Sunday
before
;
and
never
have
the
little
round
angel
'
face
on
Mr
Tomkins
's
monument
in
the
side
aisle
,
beheld
such
devotion
on
earth
as
they
all
exhibit
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
about
five
-
and
-
twenty
when
he
first
come
to
astonish
the
parishioner
.
 
<EOS>
He
part
his
hair
on
the
centre
of
his
forehead
in
the
form
of
a
Norman
arch
,
wear
a
brilliant
of
the
first
water
on
the
fourth
finger
of
his
left
hand
(
which
he
always
apply
to
his
left
cheek
when
he
read
prayer
)
,
and
have
a
deep
sepulchral
voice
of
unusual
solemnity
.
 
<EOS>
Innumerable
be
the
call
make
by
prudent
mamma
on
our
new
curate
,
and
innumerable
the
invitation
with
which
he
be
assail
,
and
which
,
to
do
him
justice
,
he
readily
accept
.
 
<EOS>
if
his
manner
in
the
pulpit
have
create
an
impression
in
his
favour
,
the
sensation
be
increase
tenfold
,
by
his
appearance
in
private
circle
.
 
<EOS>
Pews

the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
pulpit
or

-
desk

in
value
;
sitting
in
the
centre
aisle
be
at
a
premium
:
 
an
inch
of
room
in
the
front
row
of
the
gallery
could
not
be
procure
for
love
or
money
;
and
some
people
even
go
so
far
as
to
assert
,
that
the
three
Miss
Browns
,
who
have
an
obscure
family
pew
just

and

<EOS>

a
piece
of
plate

as
a

<EOS>
here

a
discovery
---

<EOS>
how
interestingly
melancholy

<EOS>
if
the
young

their
sympathy
and
solicitude
now

no
bound
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
man
as
the
curate
---
such
a
dear
---
such
a
perfect
love
---
to
be
consumptive

<EOS>
It

,
and
warm

pour
in
upon
the
curate
until
he
be
as
completely
fit
out
with
winter
clothing
,
as
if
he
be
on
the
verge
of
an
expedition
to
the
North
Pole
:
 
verbal
bulletin
of
the
state
of
his
health
be
circulate
throughout
the
parish
half
-
a
-
dozen
time
a
day
;
and
the
curate
be
in
the
very
zenith
of
his
popularity
.
   
<EOS>
about
this
period
,
a
change
come
over
the
spirit
of
the
parish
.
 
<EOS>
a
very
quiet
,
respectable
,
doze
old
gentleman
,
who
have
officiate
in
our
chapel
-
of
-
ease
for
twelve
year
previously
,
die
one
fine
morning
,
without
have
give
any
notice
whatever
of
his
intention
.
<EOS>
this
circumstance
give
rise
to
counter
-
sensation
the
first
;
and
the
arrival
of
his
successor
occasion
counter
-
sensation
the
second
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
pale
,
thin
,
cadaverous
man
,
with
large
black
eye
,
and
long
straggle
black
hair
:
 
his
dress
be
slovenly
in
the
extreme
,
his
manner
ungainly
,
his
doctrine
startling
;
in
short
,
he
be
in
every
respect
the
antipode
of
the
curate
.
 
<EOS>
crowd
of
our
female
parishioner
flock
to
hear
him
;
at
first
,
because
he
be
so
odd
-
looking
,
then
because
his
face
be
so
expressive
,
then
because
he
preach
so
well
;
and
at
last
,
because
they
really
think
that
,
after
all
,
there
be
something
about
him
which
it
be
quite
impossible
to
describe
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
curate
,
he
be
all
very
well
;
but
certainly
,
after
all
,
there
be
no
deny
that
---
that
---
in
short
,
the
curate
be
not
a
novelty
,
and
the
other
clergyman
be
.
<EOS>
the
inconstancy
of
public
opinion
be
proverbial
:
 
the
congregation
migrate
one
by
one
.
 
<EOS>
the
curate
cough
till
he
be
black
in
the
face
---
it
be
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
He
respire
with
difficulty
---
it
be
equally
ineffectual
in
awaken
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
seat

<EOS>
the

and
that

but

<EOS>
Her
entrance
into
church
on
Sunday

always
the
signal
for
a
little
bustle
in
the
side
aisle
,

a
general
rise
among
the
poor
people
,
who
bow
and

annual
variation
of
a
trip
to
some
quiet
place
on
the
sea

coast
,
pass
the
old
lady

life
.
 
<EOS>
It

and
without

<EOS>
She

very
conspicuous
in
our
parish
,
be
one
of
the
old
lady

next

door
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
an
old
naval
officer
on
half
-
pay
,
and
his
bluff
and
unceremonious
behaviour
disturb
the
old
lady
's
domestic
economy
,
not
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
he
WILL
smoke
cigar
in
the
front
court
,
and
when
he
want
something
to
drink
with
them
---
which
be
by
no
mean
an
uncommon
circumstance
---
he
lift
up
the
old
lady
's
knocker
with
his
walking
-
stick
,
and
demand
to
have
a
glass
of
table
ale
,
hand
over
the
rail
.
 
<EOS>
in
addition
to
this
cool
proceeding
,
he
be
a
bit
of
a
Jack
of
all
trade
,
or
to
use
his
own
word
,
"
a
regular
Robinson
Crusoe
;
"
and
nothing
delight
him
better
than
to
experimentalise
on
the
old
lady

property
.
 
<EOS>
one
morning
he
get
up
early
,
and
plant
three
or
four
root

grow
marigold
in
every
bed
of
her
front
garden
,
to
the
inconceivable
astonishment
of
the
old
lady
,
who
actually
think
when
she
get
up
and
look
out
of
the
window
,
that
it
be
some
strange
eruption
which
have
come
out
in
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
another
time
he
take
to
piece
the
eight

day
clock
on
the
front
landing
,
under
pretence
of
clean
the
work
,
which
he
put
together
again
,
by
some
undiscovered
process
,
in
so
wonderful
a
manner
,
that
the
large
hand
have
do
nothing
but
trip
up
the
little
one
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
take
to
breed
silk

worm
,
which
he
WOULD
bring
in
two
or
three
time
a
day
,
in
little

the
old

generally
drop
a
worm
or
two
at

<EOS>
the
consequence
be
,
that
one
morning
a
very
stout
silk

worm
be
discover
in
the
act
of
walk
up

stair
---
probably
with
the
view
of
inquire
after
his
friend
,
for
,
on
further
inspection
,
it
appear
that
some
of
his
companion
have
already
find
their
way
to
every
room
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
the
old
lady
go
to
the
seaside
in
despair
,
and
during
her
absence
he
completely
efface
the
name
from
her
brass
door

plate
,
in
his
attempt
to
polish
it
with
aqua
-
fortis
.
   
<EOS>
but
all
this
be
nothing
to
his
seditious
conduct
in
public
life
.
<EOS>
He
attend
every
vestry
meeting
that
be
hold
;
always
oppose
the
constituted
authority
of
the
parish
,
denounce
the
profligacy
of
the
churchwarden
,
contest
legal
point
against
the
vestry
-
clerk
,
will
make
the
tax
-
gatherer
call
for
his
money
till
he
will
not
call
any
longer
,
and
then
he
send
it
:
 
<EOS>
find
fault
with
the
sermon
every
Sunday
<EOS>
,
say
that
the
organist
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
,
offer
to
back
himself
for
any
amount
to
sing
the
psalm
better
than
all
the
child
put
together
,
male
and
female
;
and
,
in
short
,
conduct
himself
in
the
most
turbulent
and
uproarious
manner
.
 
<EOS>
the
bad
of
it
be
,
that
have
a
high
regard
for
the
old
lady
,
he
want
to
make
her
a
convert
to
his
view
,
and
therefore
walk
into
her
little
parlour
with
his
newspaper
in
his
hand
,
and
talk
violent
politic
by
the
hour
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
charitable
,
open
-
hearted
old
fellow
at
bottom
,
after
all
;
so
,
although
he
put
the
old
lady
a
little
out
occasionally
,
they
agree
very
well
in
the
main
,
and
she
laugh
as
much
at
each
feat
of
his
handiwork
when
it
be
all
over
,
as
anybody
else
.
   
<EOS>
the
four
sister
<EOS>
the
row
of
house
in
which
the
old
lady
and
her
troublesome
neighbour
reside
,
comprise
,
beyond
all
doubt
,
a
great
number
of
character
within
its
circumscribed
limit
,
than
all
the
rest
of
the
parish
put
together
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
can
not
,
consistently
with
our
present
plan
,
however
,
extend
the
number
of
our
parochial
sketch
beyond
six
,
it
will
be
well
perhaps
,
to
select
the
most
peculiar
,
and
to
introduce
them
at
once
without
further
preface

<EOS>
the
four
Miss
Willises

,
settle
in
our
parish
thirteen
year
ago

<EOS>
It
be
a
melancholy
reflection
that
the
old
adage
,
"
time
and
tide
wait
for
no
man
,
"
apply
with
equal
force
to
the
fairer
portion
of

creation

and
willingly
would
we
conceal
the
fact
,
that
even
thirteen
year
ago
the
Miss
Willises
be
far
from
juvenile
.
 
<EOS>
Our
duty
as
faithful
parochial
chronicler

however
,
be
paramount
to
every

consideration

They

whatever

the

and
whatever

they
all
disapprove

thus
they

live
in
Polar
harmony
among

be
it

one

now

where
on

by
what

succeed
in
persuade
themselves
that
it
be
possible
for
a
man
to
marry
one
of
them
,
without
marry
them
all
,
be
question
too
profound
for
us
to
resolve
:
 
certain
it
be
,
however
,
that
the
visit
of
Mr
Robinson
(
a
gentleman
in

public
office

with
a
good

that

court

be
perfectly
frantic
in
their
anxiety
to
discover
which
of

be
the
fortunate
fair
,

that
the
difficulty
they

the
problem
be
not

all
lessen
by

announcement

"
we

"
   
<EOS>
It
be
very
extraordinary

<EOS>
They
be
so
completely
identify

the
one
with

that
the
curiosity
of
the
whole

of

be
rouse
almost
beyond
endurance

<EOS>
the
subject
be
discuss
at

drinking

<EOS>
the
old

do
not
hesitate
to
express
his
decide
opinion
that
Mr
Robinson
be
of
eastern
descent
,
and
contemplate
marry
the
whole
family
at
once
;
and
the
row
,
generally
,
shake
their
head
with
considerable
gravity
,
and
declare
the
business
to
be
very
mysterious
.
 
<EOS>
They
hope
it
may
all
end
well
;
---
it
certainly
have
a
very
singular
appearance
,
but
still
it
would
be
uncharitable
to
express
any
opinion
without
good
ground
to
go
upon
,
and
certainly
the
Miss
Willises
be
QUITE
old
enough
to
judge
for
themselves
,
and
to
be
sure
people
ought
to
know
their
own
business
best
,
and
so
forth

than
the
regulation

to
which
the
Miss

invariably
restrict
the
somewhat
excursive
taste
of

<EOS>
the
intelligence
spread
rapidly
from

It

the
eventful

behind

join
in

<EOS>
but
who
shall
portray
the
astonishment
of
Gordon

place
,
when
Mr

hand
in

one
after

depict
the
perplexity
of

,
when
all
the

kneel
down
at
the
communion

table
,
and
repeat
the
response
incidental

marriage
service

which
prevail
,
when

even
after

all
the

Willises
go
into
hysteric
at
the
conclusion
of
the
ceremony
,
until
the
sacred
edifice
resound
with
their
united
wailing

<EOS>
as
the
four
sister

Mr

continue
to
occupy
the

house
after
this
memorable
occasion
,
and
as
the
married
sister
,
whoever
she
be
,
never
appear
in
public
without
the
other
three
,
we
be
not
quite
clear
that
the
neighbour
ever
would
have
discover
the
real
Mrs
Robinson
,
but
for
a
circumstance
of
the
most
gratifying
description
,
which
WILL
happen
occasionally
in
the
best

regulate

<EOS>
three
quarter

day
elapse
,
and
the
row

on
whom
a
new
light
appear
to
have
be
burst
for
some
time
,
begin
to
speak
with
a
sort
of
imply
confidence
on
the
subject

to
wonder
how
Mrs

the
young
Miss
Willis
that
be

get
on
;
and
servant
may
be
see
run
up

about
nine

ten
o'clock
every

with
"

compliment
,
and
wish
to
know
how
Mrs

find
herself
this
morning
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
the
answer
always
be
,
"
Mrs

's
compliment
,
and
she
be
in
very
good
spirit
,
and
do
not
find
herself
any

"
 
<EOS>
the

be
hear
no

,
the

lay
aside
,
drawing
be
neglect
,
and
mantua
-
making
and
millinery
,
on
the
small
scale
imaginable
,
appear
to
have
become
the
favourite
amusement
of
the
whole
family
.
 
<EOS>
the
parlour
be
not
quite
as
tidy
as
it
use
to
be
,
and
if
you
call
in
the
morning
,
you
would
see
lie
on
a
table
,
with
an
old
newspaper
carelessly
throw
over
them
,
two
or
three
particularly
small
cap
,
rather
large
than
if
they
have
be
make
for
a
moderate

sized
doll
,
with
a
small
piece
of
lace
,
in
the
shape
of
a
horse
-
shoe
,
let
in
behind
:
 
or
perhaps
a
white
robe
,
not
very
large
in
circumference
,
but
very
much
out
of
proportion
in
point
of
length
,
with
a
little
tucker
round
the
top
,
and
a
frill
round
the
bottom
;
and
once
when
we
call
,
we
see
a
long
white
roller
,
with
a
kind
of
blue
margin
down
each
side
,
the
probable
use
of
which
,
we
be
at
a
loss
to
conjecture
.
 
<EOS>
then
we
fancy
that
Dr
Dawson
,
the
surgeon
,
&
c
,
who
display
a
large
lamp
with
a
different
colour
in
every
pane
of
glass
,
at
the
corner
of
the
row
,
begin
to
be
knock
up
at
night
oftener
than
he
use
to
be
;
and
once
we
be
very
much
alarm
by
hear
a
hackney
-
coach
stop
at
Mrs
Robinson
's
door
,
at
half
-
past
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
out
of
which
there
emerge
a
fat
old
woman
,
in
a
cloak
and
night
-
cap
,
with
a
bundle
in
one
hand
,
and
a
pair
of
patten
in
the
other
,
who
look
as
if
she
have
be
suddenly
knock
up
out
of
bed
for
some
very
special
purpose
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
get
up
in
the
morning
we
see
that
the
knocker
be
tie
up
in
an
old
white
kid
glove
;
and
we
,
in
our
innocence
(
we
be
in
a
state
of
bachelorship
then
)
,
wonder
what
on
earth
it
all
mean
,
until
we
hear
the
eld
Miss
Willis
,
in
propria

and
then
,
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
row
,
our
curiosity
be
satisfied
,
and
we
begin
to
wonder
it
have
never
occur
to
us
what
the
matter
be

before
.
   
<EOS>
the
election
for
beadle
a
great
event
have
recently
occur
in
our
parish

<EOS>
a
contest
of
paramount
interest

a

take

<EOS>
It

a
glorious
triumph

which
the
country

or
at

the
parish

it

all
the

will
long
remember

<EOS>
We
have
have
an
election
;
an
election
for
beadle
.
<EOS>
the
supporter
of
the
old
beadle
system
have
be
defeat
in
their
stronghold
,
and
the
advocate
of
the
great
new
beadle
principle
have
achieve
a
proud
victory
.
   
<EOS>
Our
parish
,
which
,
like
all
other
parish
,
be
a
little
world
of
its
own
,
have
long
be
divide
into
two
party
,
whose
contention
,
slumber
for
a
while
,
have
never
fail
to
burst
forth
with
unabated
vigour

on

occasion
on

all

have
be
in
their
turn
the
subject
of
a
grand
struggle
;
and
as
to
question
of
patronage
,
the
asperity
and
determination
with
which
they
have
be
contest
be
scarcely
credible
.
   
<EOS>
the
leader
of
the
official
party
---
the
steady
advocate
of
the
churchwarden
,
and
the
unflinche
supporter
of
the
overseer
---
be
an
old
gentleman
who
live
in
our
row
.
 
<EOS>
He
own
some
half
a
dozen
house
in
it
,
and
always
walk
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
,
so
that
he
may
be
able
to
take
in
a
view
of
the
whole
of
his
property
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
tall
,
thin
,
bony
man
,
with
an
interrogative
nose
,
and
little
restless
perking
eye
,
which
appear
to
have
be
give
him
for
the
sole
purpose
of
peep
into
other
people
's
affair
with
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
deeply
impressed
with
the
importance
of
our
parish
business
,
and
pride
himself
,
not
a
little
,
on
his
style
of
address
the
parishioner
in
vestry
assemble
.
 
<EOS>
His
view
be
rather
confine
than
extensive
;
his
principle
more
narrow
than
liberal
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
hear
to
declaim
very
loudly
in
favour
of
the
liberty
of
the
press
,
and
advocate
the
repeal
of
the
stamp
duty
on
newspaper
,
because
the
daily
journal
who
now
have
a
monopoly
of
the
public
,
never
give
VERBATIM
report
of
vestry
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
appear
egotistical
for
the
world
,
but
at
the
same
time
he
must
say
,
that
there
be
SPEECHES
---
that
celebrate
speech
of
his
own
,
on
the
emolument
of
the
sexton
,
and
the
duty
of
the
office
,
for
instance
---
which
may
be
communicate
to
the
public
,
greatly
to
their
improvement
and
advantage
.
   
<EOS>
His
great
opponent
in
public
life
be
Captain
Purday
,
the
old
naval
officer
on
half
-
pay
,
to
whom
we
have
already
introduce
our
reader
.
 
<EOS>
the
captain
be
a
determined
opponent
of
the
constituted
authority
,
whoever
they
may
chance
to
be
,
and
our
other
friend
be
their
steady
supporter
,
with
an
equal
disregard
of
their
individual
merit
<EOS>
,
it
will
readily
be
suppose
,
that
occasion
for
their
come
into
direct
collision
be
neither
few
nor
far
between
.
 
<EOS>
They
divide
the
vestry
fourteen
time
on
a
motion
for
heat
the
church
with
warm
water
instead
of
coal
:
and
make
speech
about
liberty
and
expenditure
,
and
prodigality
and
hot
water
,
which
throw
the
whole
parish
into
a
state
of
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
captain
,
when
he
be
on
the
visit
committee
,
and
his
opponent
overseer
,
bring
forward
certain
distinct
and
specific
charge
relative
to
the
management
of
the
workhouse
,
boldly
express
his
total
want
of
confidence
in
the
exist
authority
,
and
move
for
"
a
copy
of
the
recipe
by
which
the
pauper
'
soup
be
prepare
,
together
with
any
document
relate
thereto
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
the
overseer
steadily
resist
;
he
fortify
himself
by
precedent
,
appeal
to
the
establish
usage
,
and
decline
to
produce
the
paper
,
on
the
ground
of
the
injury
that
would
be
do
to
the
public
service
,
if
document
of
a
strictly
private
nature
,
pass
between
the
master
of
the
workhouse
and
the
cook
,
be
to
be
thus
drag
to
light
on
the
motion
of
any
individual
member
of
the
vestry
.
 
<EOS>
the
motion
be
lose
by
a
majority
of
two
;
and
then
the
captain
,
who
never
allow
himself
to
be
defeat
,
move
for
a
committee
of
inquiry
into
the
whole
subject
.
 
<EOS>
the
affair
grow
serious
:
 
<EOS>
the
question
be
discuss
at
meeting
after
meeting
,
and
vestry
after
vestry
;
speech
be
make
,
attack
repudiate
,
personal
defiance
exchange
,
explanation
receive
,
and
the
great
excitement
prevail
,
until
at
last
,
just
as
the
question
be
go
to
be
finally
decide
,
the
vestry
find
that
somehow
or
other
,
they
have
become
entangle
in
a
point
of
form
,
from
which
it
be
impossible
to
escape
with
propriety
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
the
motion
be
drop
,
and
everybody
look
extremely
important
,
and
seem
quite
satisfied
with
the
meritorious
nature
of
the
whole
proceeding
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
the
state
of
affair
in
our
parish
a
week
or
two
since
,
when
Simmons
,
the
beadle
,
suddenly
die
.
 
<EOS>
the
lament
deceased
have
over
-
exert
himself
,
a
day
or
two
previously
,
in
convey
an
aged
female
,
highly
intoxicate
,
to
the
strong
room
of
the
work
-
house
.
<EOS>
the
excitement
thus
occasion
,
add
to
a
severe
cold
,
which
this
indefatigable
officer
have
catch
in
his
capacity
of
director
of
the
parish
engine
,
by
inadvertently
play
over
himself
instead
of
a
fire
,
prove
too
much
for
a
constitution
already
enfeeble
by
age
;
and
the
intelligence
be
convey
to
the
Board
one
evening
that
Simmons
have
die
,
and
leave
his
respect
.
   
<EOS>
the
breath
be
scarcely
out
of
the
body
of
the
deceased
functionary
,
when
the
field
be
fill
with
competitor
for
the
vacant
office
,
each
of
whom
rest
his
claim
to
public
support
,
entirely
on
the
number
and
extent
of
his
family
,
as
if
the
office
of
beadle
be
originally

as
an
encouragement
for
the

be
consider
certain

several

half
promise
their

the
nine

announce

meritorious
candidate

"
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
resist
this
;
ten
small
child
would
have
be
almost
irresistible
in
themselves
,
without
the
twin
,
but
the
touching
parenthesis
about
that
interesting
production
of
nature
,
and
the
still
more
touching
allusion
to
Mrs
Spruggins
,
must
ensure
success
.
 
<EOS>
Spruggins
be
the
favourite
at
once
,
and
the
appearance
of
his
lady
,
as
she
go
about
to
solicit
vote
(
which
encourage
confident
hope
of
a
still
further
addition
to
the

Spruggins
at
no
remote
period
)
,
increase
the
general
prepossession
in
his
favour
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
candidate
,
Bung
alone
except
,
resign
in
despair
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
of
election
be
fix
;
and
the
canvass
proceed
with
briskness
and
perseverance
on
both
side
.
   
<EOS>
the
member
of
the
vestry
could
not
be
suppose
to
escape
the
contagious
excitement
inseparable
from
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
the
majority
of
the
lady
inhabitant
of
the
parish
declare
at
once
for
spruggin
;
and
the
QUONDAM
overseer
take
the
same
side
,
on
the
ground
that
man
with
large
family
always
have
be
elect
to
the
office
,
and
that
although
he
must
admit
,
that
,
in
other
respect
,
Spruggins
be
the
least
qualified
candidate
of
the
two
,
still
it
be
an
old
practice
,
and
he
see
no
reason
why
an
old
practice
should
be
depart
from
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
enough
for
the
captain
.
 
<EOS>
He
immediately
side
with
Bung
,
canvass
for
him
personally
in
all
direction
,
write
squibs
on
Spruggins
,
and
get
his
butcher
to
skewer
them
up
on
conspicuous
joint
in
his
shop
-
front
;
frighten
his
neighbour
,
the
old
lady
,
into
a
palpitation
of
the
heart
,
by
his
awful
denunciation
of
Spruggins
's
party

and
bounce
in

out
,
and
up

down

and
backwards

forwards
,
until
all
the
sober
inhabitant
of
the
parish
think
it
inevitable
that
he
must
die
of
a
brain
fever
,
long
before
the
election
begin
.
   
<EOS>
the
day
of
election
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
longer
an
individual
struggle
,
but
a
party
contest
between
the
in
and
out
.
 
<EOS>
the
question
be
,
whether
the
wither
influence
of
the
overseer
,
the
domination
of
the
churchwarden
,
and
the
blight
despotism
of
the
vestry
-
clerk
,
should
be
allow
to
render
the
election
of
beadle
a
form
---
a
nullity
:
 
whether
they
should
impose
a
vestry
-
elect
beadle
on
the
parish
,
to
do
their
bidding
and
forward
their
view
,
or
whether
the
parishioner
,
fearlessly
assert
their
undoubted
right
,
should
elect
an
independent
beadle
of
their
own
.
   
<EOS>
the
nomination
be
fix
to
take
place
in
the
vestry
,
but
so
great
be
the
throng
of
anxious
spectator
,
that
it
be
find
necessary
to
adjourn
to
the
church
,
where
the
ceremony
commence
with
due
solemnity
.
 
<EOS>
the
appearance
of
the
churchwarden
and
overseer
,
and
the
ex
-
churchwarden
and
ex
-
overseer
,
with
Spruggins
in
the
rear
,
excited
general
attention
.
 
<EOS>
Spruggins
be
a
little
thin
man
,
in
rusty
black
,
with
a
long
pale
face
,
and
a
countenance
expressive
of
care
and
fatigue
,
which
may
either
be
attribute
to
the
extent
of
his
family
or
the
anxiety
of
his
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
His
opponent
appear
in
a
cast
-
off
coat
of
the
captain
's
---
a
blue
coat
with
bright
button
;
white
trouser
,
and
that
description
of
shoe
familiarly
know
by
the
appellation
of
"
high
-
low
.
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
serenity
in
the
open
countenance
of
Bung
---
a
kind
of
moral
dignity
in
his
confident
air
---
<EOS>
an
"
I
wish
you
may
get
it
"
sort
of
expression
in
his
eye
---
which
infuse
animation
into
his
supporter
,
and
evidently
dispirit
his
opponent
.
   
<EOS>
the
ex

churchwarden
rise
to
propose
Thomas
Spruggins
for
beadle
.
<EOS>
He
have
know
him
long
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
have
his
eye
upon
him
closely
for

(
a

but
the

in
loud

<EOS>
He
would
repeat
that
he
have

such

He

He
would
not

He

He

he

not

that
nine

twin

be
very
bad
example
for
pauper
imitation
(
loud

He

to
the

It

take
it
for

look

about

be

be
it

that
by

amidst

by

to
sound
the

<EOS>
on

the
polling
begin

and
we
never
have
have
such
a
bustle
in
our
parish
since
we
get
up
our
famous
anti

slavery
petition
,
which
be
such
an
important
one
,
that
the
House
of
Commons
order
it
to
be
print

on

motion

<EOS>
the

engage
two
hackney

coach

a
cab
for
Bung

people
---
the
cab
for
the
drunken

and
the

for
the
old

the
great
portion
of
whom

owe

impetuosity

sufficiently
to

with
any

of
clearness

what
they
have
be
do

<EOS>
the
opposite
party
wholly
neglect
these
precaution

the
consequence
be

that
a
great
many
lady

be
walk
leisurely
up

it

hot

to

be
artfully
decoy
into

vote
for

<EOS>
the

argument

too

have
produce
considerable
effect

the

produce
a

<EOS>
a
threat
of
exclusive
dealing
be
clearly
establish
against
the
vestry

clerk
---
a
case
of
heartless
and
profligate
atrocity
.
 
<EOS>
It
appear
that
the
delinquent
have
be
in
the
habit
of
purchase
six
penn'orth
of
muffin
,
weekly
,
from
an
old
woman
who
rent
a
small
house
in
the
parish

reside
among
the
original
settler

on
her
last
weekly
visit

a
message
be
convey
to
her
through
the
medium

the
cook

couch
in
mysterious
term

indicate
with
sufficient
clearness
,
that
the
vestry

clerk
's
appetite
for
muffin
,
in
future
,
depend
entirely
on
her
vote
on
the
beadleship

<EOS>
this
be
sufficient
:
 
<EOS>
the
stream
have
be
turn
previously
,
and
the
impulse
thus
administer
direct
its
final
course
.
 
<EOS>
the
Bung
party
order
one
shilling's
-
worth
of
muffin
weekly
for
the
remainder
of
the
old
woman
's
natural
life
;
the
parishioner
be
loud
in
their
exclamation
;
and
the
fate
of
Spruggins
be
seal
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
that
the

exhibit
in
dress
of
the
same
pattern

and
night

<EOS>
the

Mrs
Spruggins
's
right
arm

and
the
girl
in
her
left
---
<EOS>
even
Mrs
Spruggins
herself
fail
to
be
an
object
of
sympathy
any
longer

<EOS>
the
majority
attain
by
Bung
on
the
gross
poll
be
four
hundred
and
twenty

eight

and
the
cause
of
the

triumph

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
the
excitement
of
the
late
election
have
subside
,
and
our
parish
be
once
again
restore
to
a
state
of
comparative
tranquillity
,
we
be
enable
to
devote
our
attention
to
those
parishioner
who
take
little
share
in
our
party
contest
or
in
the
turmoil

bustle
of
public
life

<EOS>
and
we
feel
sincere
pleasure
in
acknowledge
here
,
that
in
collect
material
for
this
task
we
have
be
greatly
assist
by
Mr
Bung
himself
,
who
have
impose
on
us
a
debt
of
obligation
which
we
fear
we
can
never
repay
.
 
<EOS>
the
life
of
this
gentleman
have
be
one
of
a
very
chequer
description
:
 
he
have
undergo
transition
---
not
from
grave
to
gay
,
for
he
never
be
grave
---
not
from
lively
to
severe
,
for
severity
form
no
part
of
his
disposition
;
his
fluctuation
have
be
between
poverty
in
the
extreme
,
and
poverty
modify
,
or
,
to
use
his
own
emphatic
language
,
"
between
nothing
to
eat
and
just
half
enough
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
,
as
he
forcibly
remark
,
"
one
of
those
fortunate
man
who
,
if
they
be

dive
under

side

would
come
up

neither

those

whose
spirit
have

break
beyond

by
misfortune

He
be
just
one
of
the
careless

good

happy
fellow

who

anon
to

always

merrily

<EOS>
some
few

upon
to

for
the
office

attach
him
to

on
the
opportunity
he
here
acquire
of
ascertain
the
condition
of
most
of
the
poor
inhabitant
of

his

ground
his

to
public
support

<EOS>
Chance
throw
the
man
in
our
way
a
short
time
since
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
,
in
the
first
instance
,
attract
by
his
prepossess
impudence
at
the
election
;
we
be
not
surprised
,
on
further
acquaintance
,
to
find
him
a
shrewd

know
fellow

with
no
inconsiderable
power
of
observation

after
converse
with
him

little

(
as
we
dare

frequently

not

of
sympathise
with
,

to
all
appearance
of

feeling
to
which
they
themselves
be
entire
stranger

<EOS>
We
have
be
express
to
the
new
functionary
our
surprise
that
he
should
ever
have
serve
in
the
capacity
to
which
we
have
just

when
we
gradually
lead
him
into
one

<EOS>
as
we

induce
to

on
reflection
,
that
they
will
tell
better

MR
BUNG
's
narrative
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
true
,
as
you
say
,
sir
,
"
Mr
Bung
commence
,
"
that
a
broker
's
man
's
be
not
a
life
to
be
envy
;
and
in
course
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
,
though
you
do
not
say
it
,
that
people
hate
and
scout
'em
because
they
be
the
minister
of
wretchedness
,
like
,
to
poor
people
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
could
I
do
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
the
thing
be
no
bad
because
I
do
it
,
instead
of
somebody
else
;
and
if
put
me
in
possession
of
a
house
would
put
me
in
possession
of
three
and
sixpence
a
day
,
and
levy
a
distress
on
another
man
's
good
would
relieve
my
distress
and
that
of
my
family
,
it
can
not
be
expect
but
what
I
would
take
the
job
and
go
through
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
like
it
<EOS>
,
God
know
;
I
always
look
out
for
something
else
,
and
<EOS>
the
moment
I
get
other
work
to
do
,
I
leave
it
.
 
<EOS>
if
there
be
anything
wrong
in
be
the
agent
in
such
matter
---
not
the
principal
,
mind
you
---
I
be
sure
the
business
,
to
a
beginner
like
I
be
,
at
all
event
,
carry
its
own
punishment
along
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
again
and
again
that
the
people
would
only
blow
me
up
,
or
pitch
into
me
---
that
I
would
not
have
mind
<EOS>
,
it
be
all
in
my
way
;
but
it
be
the
being
shut
up
by
yourself
in
one
room
for
five
day
,
without
so
much
as
an
old
newspaper
to
look
at
,
or
anything
to
see
out
o
'
the
winder
but
the
roof
and
chimney
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
or
anything
to
listen
to
,
but
the
ticking
,
perhaps
,
of
an
old
dutch
clock
,
the
sobbing
of
the
missis
,
now
and
then
,
the
low
talking
of
friend
in
the
next
room
,
who
speak
in
whisper
,
lest
"
the
man
"
should
overhear
them
,
or
perhaps
the
occasional
opening
of
the
door
,
as
a
child
peep
in
to
look
at
you
,
and
then
run
half
-
frightened
away
<EOS>
---
it
be
all
this
,
that
make
you
feel
sneak
somehow
,
and
ashamed
of
yourself
;
and
then
,
if
it
be
wintertime
,
they
just
give
you
fire
enough
to
make
you
think
you
would
like
more
,
and
bring
in
your
grub
as
if
they
wish
it
'
ud
choke
you
---
as
I
dare
say
they
do
,
for
the
matter
of
that
,
most
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
be
very
civil
,
they
make
you
up
a
bed
in
the
room
at
night
,
and
if
they
do
not
,
your
master
send
one
in
for
you
;
but
there
you
be
,
without
be
wash
or
shave
all
the
time
,
shun
by
everybody
,
and
speak
to
by
no
one
,
unless
some
one
come
in
at
dinner
-
time
,
and
ask
you
whether
you
want
any
more
,
in
a
tone
as
much
to
say
,
"
I
hope
you
do
not
,
"
or
,
in
the
evening
,
to
inquire
whether
you
would
not
rather
have
a
candle
,
after
you
have
be
sit
in
the
dark
half
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
be
leave
in
this
way
,
I
use
to
sit
,
think
,
think
,
think
,
till
I
feel
as
lonesome
as
a
kitten
in
a
wash
-
house
copper
with
the
lid
on
;
but
I
believe
the
old
broker
'
man
who
be
regularly
train
to
it
,
never
think
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hear
some
on
'em
<EOS>
say
,
indeed
,
that
they
do
not
know
how
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
put
in
a
good
many
distress
in
my
time
(
continue
Mr
Bung
)
,
and
in
course
I
be
not
long
in
finding
,
that
some
people
be
not
as
much
to
be
pity
as
other
be
,
and
that
people
with
good
income
who
get
into
difficulty
,
which
they
keep
patch
up
day
after
day
and
week
after
week
,
get
so
used
to
these
sort
of
thing
in
time
,
that
at
last
they
come
scarcely
to
feel
them
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
the
very
first
place
I
be
put
in
possession
of
,
be
a
gentleman
's
house
in
this
parish
here
,
that
everybody
would
suppose
could
not
help
have
money
if
he
try
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
with
old
Fixem
,
my
old
master
,
about
half
arter
eight
in
the
morning
;
ring
the
area
-
bell
;
servant
in
livery
open
the
door
:
 
<EOS>
"
Governor
at
home
?
"
<EOS>
---
"
yes
,
he
be
,
"
say
the
man
;
"
but
he
be
breakfast
just
now
.
"
<EOS>
"
never
mind
,
"
say
Fixem
,
"
<EOS>
just
you
tell
him
there
be
a
gentleman
here
,
as
want
to
speak
to
him
partickler
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
the
servant
he
open
his
eye
,
and
stare
about
him
all
way
---
look
for
the
gentleman
,
as
it
strike
me
,
for
I
do
not
think
anybody
but
a
man
as
be
stone
-
blind
would
mistake
Fixem
for
one
;
and
as
for
me
,
I
be
as
seedy
as
a
cheap
cowcumber
.
 
<EOS>
hows'ever
,
he
turn
round
,
and
go
to
the
breakfast
-
parlour
,
which
be
a
little
snug
sort
of
room
at
the
end
of
the
passage
,
and
Fixem
(
as
we
always
do
in
that
profession
)
,
without
wait
to
be
announce
,
walk
in
arter
him
,
and
before
the
servant
could
get
out
,
"
please
,
sir
,
here
be
a
man
as
want
to
speak
to
you
,
"
look
in
at
the
door
as
familiar
and
pleasant
as
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
the
devil
be
you
,
and
how
dare
you
walk
into
a
gentleman
's
house
without
leave
?
"
say
the
master
,
as
fierce
as
a
bull
in
fit
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
name
,
"
say
Fixem
,
wink
to
the
master
to
send
the
servant
away
,
and
put
the
warrant
into
his
hand
fold
up
like
a
note
,
"
My
name
's
Smith
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
I
call
from
Johnson
's
about
that
business
of
Thompson

"
<EOS>
---
"
oh

"
say
the
other
,
quite
down
on
him
directly
,
"
<EOS>
how
be
Thompson

say
he
;
"
pray
sit
down

Mr

"
 
<EOS>
Out
go
the
servant
;
and
the
gentleman
and
Fixem
look
at
one
another
till
they
could
not
look
any
longer
,
and
then
they
vary
the
amusement
by
look
at
me

who

<EOS>
just
step
here

Mr
Smith

say
he
,
after
a
short
pause
.
 
<EOS>
so
Fixem
walk
with
him
up
to
the
window
,
and
after
a
good
deal
of
whispering
,
and
a
little
chinking
of
suverin
,
and
look
at
me
,
he
come
back
and
say
,
"
Bung
,
you

a
handy
fellow

very
honest
I

<EOS>
this

want
an

day

"
say
old
Fixem
,
grin
like
mad
,
and
shove
a
couple
of
suverin
into
my
hand
,
"
he
will
be
very
glad
to

"
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
laugh
:
 
and
the
gentleman
laugh
,
and
we
all
laugh
;
and
I
go
home
and
clean
myself
,
leave
Fixem
there
,
and
when
I
go
back
,
Fixem
go
away
,

I
polish
up

nobody
have
the

I

come
out

for
one
of

remain

come
down

stair
into
the
hall

I
be
sit
pretty
late

you

"
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
a
do
,
to
get
me
out
of
the
house
,
and
be
just
go
to
say
so
,
sulkily
enough
,
when
the
gentleman
(
who
be
up
to
everything

come
run
down

as

he
be
in
great
anxiety

pretend

I.
 
"
<EOS>
why
the
devil
<EOS>
an't
you
look
after
that
plate
?
"
<EOS>
---
"
I
be
just
go
to
send
him
for
a
coach
for
me
,
"
say
the
other
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
I
be
just
a
-
go
to
say
,
"
say
I
---
<EOS>
"
anybody
else
,
my
dear
fellow

"
interrupt
the
master
of
the
house
,
push
me
down
the
passage

get
out

way

anybody
else
;
but
I
have
put
this
man
in
possession
of
all
the
plate

valuable
,

I
can
not
allow
him
on
any
consideration
whatever

to
leave

<EOS>
Bung
,
you
scoundrel
,
go
and
count
those
fork
in
the
breakfast
-
parlour
instantly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
I
go
laugh
pretty
hearty
when
I
find
it
be
all
right
.
 
<EOS>
the
money
be
pay
next
day
,
with
the
addition
of
something
else
for
myself
,
and
that
be
the
good
job
that
I
(
and
I
suspect
old
Fixem
too
)
<EOS>
ever
get
in
that
line
.
   
<EOS>
"
but
this
be
the
bright
side
of
the
picture
,
sir
,
after
all
,
"
resume
Mr
Bung
,
lay
aside
the
know
look
and
flash
air
,
with
which
he
have
repeat
the
previous
anecdote
---
"
and
I
be
sorry
to
say
<EOS>
,
it
be
the
side
one
see
very
,
very
seldom
,
in
comparison
with
the
dark
one
.
 
<EOS>
the
civility
which
money
will
purchase
,
be
rarely
extended
to
those
who
have
none
;
and
there
be
a
consolation
even
in
be
able
to
patch
up
one
difficulty
,
to
make
way
for
another
,
to
which
very
poor
people
be
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
once
put
into
a
house
down
George's
-
yard
---
that
little
dirty
court
at
the
back
of
the
gas
-
work
;
and
I
never
shall
forget
the
misery
of
them
people
,
dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
distress
for
half
a
year
's
rent
---
two
pound
ten
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
only
two
room
in
the
house
,
and
as
there
be
no
passage
,
the
lodger
up
-
stair
always
go
through
the
room
of
the
people
of
the
house
,
as
they
pass
in
and
out
;
and
every
time
they
do
so
<EOS>
-which
,
on
the
average
,
be
about
four
time
every
quarter
of
an
hour
---
they
blow
up
quite
frightful
:
 
for
their
thing
have
be
seize
too
,
and
include
in
the
inventory
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
piece
of
enclose
dust
in
front
of
the
house
,
with
a
cinder
-
path
lead
up
to
the
door
,
and
an
open
rain
-
water
butt
on
one
side
.
 
<EOS>
a
dirty
striped
curtain
,
on
a
very
slack
string
,
hang
in
the
window
,
and
a
little
triangular
bit
of
broken
looking
-
glass
rest
on
the
sill
inside
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
be
mean
for
the
people
's
use
,
but
their
appearance
be
so
wretched
,
and
so
miserable
,
that
I
be
certain
they
never
could
have
pluck
up
courage
to
look
themselves
in
the
face
a
second
time
,
if
they
survive
the
fright
of
do
so
once
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
two
or
three
chair
,
that
may
have
be
worth
,
in
their
good
day
,
from
eightpence
to
a
shill
a
-
piece
;
a
small
deal
table
,
an
old
corner
cupboard
with
nothing
in
it
,
and
one
of
those
bedstead
which
turn
up
half
way
,
and
leave
the
bottom
leg
stick
out
for
you
to
knock
your
head
against
,
or
hang
your
hat
upon
;
no
bed
,
no
bedding
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
old
sack
,
by
way
of
rug
,
before
the
fireplace
,
and
four
or
five
child
be
grovel
about
,
among
the
sand
on
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
the
execution
be
only
put
in
,
to
get
'em
out
of
the
house
,
for
there
be
nothing
to
take
to
pay
the
expense
;
and
here
I
stop
for
three
day
,
though
that
be
a
mere
form
too
:
 
for
,
in
course
,
I
know
,
and
we
all
know
,
they
could
never
pay
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
of
the
chair
,
by
the
side
of
the
place
where
the
fire
ought
to
have
be
,
be
an
old
'
ooman
---
the
ugly
and
dirty
I
ever
see
---
who
sit
rock
herself
backwards
and
forwards
,
backwards
and
forwards
,
without
once
stop
,
except
for
an
instant
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
to
clasp
together
the
withered
hand
which
,
with
these
exception
,
she
keep
constantly
rub
upon
her
knee
,
just
raise
and
depress
her
finger
convulsively
,
in
time
to
the
rocking
of
the
chair
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
side
sit
the
mother
with
an
infant
in
her
arm
,
which
cry
till
it
cry
itself
to
sleep
,
and
when
it
"
wake
,
cry
till
it
cry
itself
off
again
.
<EOS>
the
old
'
ooman
's
voice
<EOS>
I
never
hear
:
 
<EOS>
she
seem
completely
stupefy
;
and
as
to
the
mother
's
,
it
would
have
be
well
if
she
have
be
so
too
,
for
misery
have
change
her
to
a
devil
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
have
hear
how
she
curse
the
little
naked
child
as
be
roll
on
the
floor
,
and
see
how
savagely
she
strike
the
infant
when
it
cry
with
hunger
,
you
would
have
shudder
as
much
as
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
there
they
remain
all
the
time
:
 
<EOS>
the
child
eat
a
morsel
of
bread
once
or
twice
,
and
I
give
'em
good
part
of
the
dinner
my
missis
bring
me
,
but
the
woman
eat
nothing
;
they
never
even
lay
on
the
bedstead
,
nor
be
the
room
sweep
or
clean
all
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
neighbour
be
all
too
poor
themselves
to
take
any
notice
of
'em
,
but
from
what
I
could
make
out
from
the
abuse
of
the
woman
up
-
stair
,
it
seem
the
husband
have
be
transport
a
few
week
before
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
time
be
up
,
the
landlord
and
old
Fixem
too
,
get
rather
frightened
about
the
family
,
and
so
they
make
a
stir
about
it
,
and
have
'em
take
to
the
workhouse
.
 
<EOS>
They
send
the
sick
couch
for
the
old
'
ooman
,
and
Simmons
take
the
child
away
at
night
.
<EOS>
the
old
'
ooman
go
into
the
infirmary
,
and
very
soon
die
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
be
all
in
the
house
to
this
day
,
and
very
comfortable
they
be
in
comparison
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
mother
,
there
be
no
tame
her
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
a
quiet
,
hard
-
work
woman
,
I
believe
,
but
her
misery
have
actually
drive
her
wild
;
so
after
she
have
be
send
to
the
house
of
correction
half
-
a
-
dozen
time
,
for
throw
inkstand
at
the
overseer
,
blaspheme
the
churchwarden
,
and
smash
everybody
as
come
near
her
,
she
burst
a
blood
-
vessel
one
mornin
'
,
and
die
too
;
and
a
happy
release
it
be
,
both
for
herself
and
the
old
pauper
,
male
and
female
,
which
she
use
to
tip
over
in
all
direction
,
as
if
they
be
so
many
skittle
,
and
she
the
ball
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
this
be
bad
enough
,
"
resume
Mr
Bung
,
take
a
half
-
step
towards
the
door
,
as
if
to
intimate
that
he
have
nearly
conclude
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
bad
enough
,
but
there
be
a
sort
of
quiet
misery
---
if
you
understand
what
I
mean
by
that
,
sir
---
about
a
lady
at
one
house
I
be
put
into
,
as
touch
me
a
good
deal
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
not
matter
where
it
be
exactly
:
 
indeed
,
I
would
rather
not
say
,
but
it
be
the
same
sort
o
'
job
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
with
Fixem
in
the
usual
way
---
there
be
a
year
's
rent
in
arrear
;
a
very
small
servant
-
girl
open
the
door
,
and
three
or
four
fine
-
look
little
child
be
in
the
front
parlour
we
be
show
into
,
which
be
very
clean
,
but
very
scantily
furnish
,
much
like
the
child
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bung
,
"
say
Fixem
to
me
,
in
a
low
voice
,
when
we
be
leave
alone
for
a
minute
,
"
I
know
something
about
this
here
family
,
and
my
opinion
be
,
it
be
no
go
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
they
can
not
settle
?
"
say
I
,
quite
anxiously
;
for
I
like
the
look
of
them
child
.
 
<EOS>
Fixem
shake
his
head
,
and
be
just
about
to
reply
,
when
the
door
open
,
and
in
come
a
lady
,
as
white
as
ever
<EOS>
I
see
any
one
in
my
day
,
except
about
the
eye
,
which
be
red
with
crying
.
 
<EOS>
She
walk
in
,
as
firm
as
I
could
have
do
;
shut
the
door
carefully
after
her
,
and
sit
herself
down
with
a
face
as
compose
as
if
it
be
make
of
stone
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
,
gentleman
?
<EOS>
"
say
she
,
in
a
surprisin
'
steady
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
this
an
execution
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
,
mum
,
"
say
Fixem
.
 
<EOS>
the
lady
look
at
him
as
steady
as
ever
:
 
<EOS>
she
do
not
seem
to
have
understand
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
,
mum
,
"
say
Fixem
again
;
"
this
be
my
warrant
of
distress
,
mum
,
"
say
he
,
hand
it
over
as
polite
as
if
it
be
a
newspaper
which
have
be
bespeak
arter
the
next
gentleman

<EOS>
"
the
lady
's
lip
tremble
as
she
take
the
print
paper
.
 
<EOS>
She
cast
her
eye
over
it
,
and
old
Fixem
begin
to
explain
the
form
,
but
see
she
be
not
read
it
,
plain
enough
,
poor
thing
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
my
God
!
"
say
she
,
suddenly
a
-
burst
out
cry
,
let
the
warrant
fall
,
and
hide
her
face
in
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
my
God
!
<EOS>
what
will
become
of
us
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
noise
she
make
,
bring
in
a
young
lady
of
about
nineteen
or
twenty
,
who
,
I
suppose
,
have
be
a
-
listening
at
the
door
,
and
who
have
get
a
little
boy
in
her
arm
:
 
<EOS>
she
sit
him
down
in
the
lady
's
lap
,
without
speak
,
and
she
hug
the
poor
little
fellow
to
her
bosom
,
and
cry
over
him
,
till
even
old
Fixem
put
on
his
blue
spectacle
to
hide
the
two
tear
,
that
be
a

trickle
down
,
one
on
each
side
of
his
dirty
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
dear
ma

say
the
young
lady
,
"
you
know
how
much
you
have
bear

<EOS>
for
all
our
sake

for
pa

say
she
,
"
do
not

way
to
this

<EOS>
---
"
no

no

I
will
not

"
say
the
lady
,
gather
herself
up
,
hastily
,
and
dry
her
eye
;
"
I
be
very
foolish
,
but
I
be
well
now

much
well

"
<EOS>
and
then
she
rouse
herself
up
,
go
with
us
into
every
room
while
we
take
the
inventory
,
open
all
the
drawer
of
her
own
accord
,
sort
the
child
's
little
clothe
to
make
the
work
easy
;
and
,
except
do
everything
in
a
strange
sort
of
hurry
,
seem
as
calm

compose
as

nothing
have
happen

<EOS>
when
we
come
down

stair
again
,
she
hesitate
a
minute
or
two
,
and
at
last
say
,
"
Gentlemen

she
,

a

<EOS>
a

return

West
Indies

he
be

on
his

Overtures

by

<EOS>
Their
object
be
the
same
,
and
why
not
have
a
joint
meeting
of
the
two
society
?
 
<EOS>
the
proposition
be
accept
.
<EOS>
the
meeting
be
duly
herald
by
public
announcement
,
and
the
room
be
crowd
to
suffocation
.
 
<EOS>
the
Missionary
appear
on
the
platform
;
he
be
hail
with
enthusiasm
.
 
<EOS>
He
repeat
a
dialogue
he
have
hear
between
two
negro
,
behind
a
hedge
,
on
the
subject
of
distribution
society
;
the
approbation
be
tumultuous

<EOS>
He
give
an
imitation
of
the
two
negro
in
broken
English
;
the
roof
be
rend
with
applause
.
 
<EOS>
from
that
period
we
date
(
with
one
trifling
exception
)
a
daily
increase
in
the
popularity
of
the
distribution
society
,
and
an
increase
of
popularity
,
which
the
feeble
and
impotent
opposition
of
the
examination
party
,
have
only
tend
to
augment
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
the
great
point
about
the
childbed
-
linen
monthly
loan
society
be
,
that
it
be
less
dependent
on
the
fluctuation
of
public
opinion
than
either
the
distribution
or
the
child
's
examination
;
and
that
,
come
what
may
,
there
be
never
any
lack
of
object
on
which
to
exercise
its
benevolence
.
 
<EOS>
Our
parish
be
a
very
populous
one
,
and
,
if
anything
,
contribute
,
we
should
be
dispose
to
say
,
rather
more
than
its
due
share
to
the
aggregate
amount
of
birth
in
the
metropolis
and
its
environ
.
 
<EOS>
the
consequence
be
,
that
the
monthly
loan
society
flourish
,
and
invest
its
member
with
a
most
enviable
amount
of
bustling
patronage
.
 
<EOS>
the
society
(
whose
only
notion
of
divide
time
,
would
appear
to
be
its
allotment
into
month
)
hold
monthly
tea
-
drinking
,
at
which
the
monthly
report
be
receive
,
a
secretary
elect
for
the
month
ensue
,
and
such
of
the
monthly
box
as
may
not
happen
to
be
out
on
loan
for
the
month
,
carefully
examine
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
never
present
at
one
of
these
meeting
,
from
all
of
which
it
be
scarcely
necessary
to
say
,
gentleman
be
carefully
exclude
;
but
Mr
Bung
have
be
call
before
the
board
once
or
twice
,
and
we
have
his
authority
for
state
,
that
its
proceeding
be
conduct
with
great
order
and
regularity
:
 
not
more
than
four
member
be
allow
to
speak
at
one
time
on
any
pretence
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
the
regular
committee
be
compose
exclusively
of
married
lady
,
but
a
vast
number
of
young
unmarried
lady
of
from
eighteen
to
twenty
-
five
year
of
age
,
respectively
,
be
admit
as
honorary
member
,
partly
because
they
be
very
useful
in
replenish
the
box
,
and
visit
the
confine
;
partly
because
it
be
highly
desirable
that
they
should
be
initiate
,
at
an
early
period
,
into
the
more
serious
and
matronly
duty
of
after
-
life
;
and
partly
,
because
prudent
mamma
have
not
unfrequently
be
know
to
turn
this
circumstance
to
wonderfully
good
account
in
matrimonial
speculation
.
   
<EOS>
in
addition
to
the
loan
of
the
monthly
box
(
which
be
always
paint
blue
,
with
the
name
of
the
society
in
large
white
letter
on
the
lid

,

and
sugar
,
commonly
know
by
the
name
of
"
candle

"
to
its
patient
.
 
<EOS>
and
here
again
the
service
of
the
honorary
member
be
call
into
requisition
,
and
most
cheerfully
concede
.
 
<EOS>
deputation
of
two
or
three
be
send
out
to
visit
the
patient
,
and
on
these
occasion
there
be
such
a
tasting
of
candle
and
beef
-
tea
,
such
a
stirring
about
of
little
mess
in
tiny
saucepan
on
the
hob
,
such
a
dressing
and
undressing
of
infant
,
such
a
tying
,
and
fold
,
and
pin
;
such
a
nursing
and
warming
of
little
leg
and
foot
before
the
fire
,
such
a
delightful
confusion
of
talking
and
cook
,
bustle
,
importance
,
and
officiousness
,
as
never
can
be
enjoy
in
its
full
extent
but
on
similar
occasion

<EOS>
in
rivalry
of
these
two
institution
,
and
as
a
last
expire
effort
to
acquire
parochial
popularity
,
the
child

the
other

<EOS>
the

gain
a
momentary
victory
,
and
the
Johnson

retreat
in
despair
.
   
<EOS>
a
secret
council
of
the
distributionist
be
hold
that
night
,
with
Mrs
Johnson
Parker
in
the
chair
,
to
consider
of
the
good
mean
of
recover
the
ground
they
have
lose
in
the
favour
of
the
parish
.
<EOS>
what
could
be
do
?
 
<EOS>
another
meeting
!
 
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
who
be
to
attend
it
?
<EOS>
the
Missionary
would
not
do
twice
;
and
the
slave
be
emancipate
.
<EOS>
a
bold
step
must
be
take
.
 
<EOS>
the
parish
must
be
astonish
in
some
way
or
other
;
but
no
one
be
able
to
suggest
what
the
step
should
be
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
a
very
old
lady
be
hear
to
mumble
,
in
indistinct
tone
,
"
Exeter
Hall
.
"
 
<EOS>
a
sudden
light
break
in
upon
the
meeting
.
<EOS>
It
be
unanimously
resolve
,
that
a
deputation
of
old
lady
should
wait
upon
a
celebrated
orator
,
implore
his
assistance
,
and
the
favour
of
a
speech
;
and
the
deputation
should
also
wait
on
two
or
three
other
imbecile
old
woman
,
not
resident
in
the
parish
,
and
entreat
their
attendance
.
 
<EOS>
the
application
be
successful
,
the
meeting
be
hold
;
the
orator
(
an
Irishman
)
come
.
 
<EOS>
He
talk
of
green
isle
---
other
shore
---
vast
Atlantic
---
bosom
of
the
deep
---
christian
charity
---
blood
and
extermination
---
mercy
in
heart
---
arm
in
hand
---
altar
and
home
---
household
god
.
 
<EOS>
He
wipe
his
eye
,
he
blow
his
nose
,
and
he
quote
Latin
.
 
<EOS>
the
effect
be
tremendous
---
the
Latin
be
a
decide
hit
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
know
exactly
what
it
be
about
,
but
everybody
know
it
must
be
affect
,
because
even
the
orator
be
overcome
.
 
<EOS>
the
popularity
of
the
distribution
society
among
the
lady
of
our
parish
be
unprecedented
;
and
the
child
's
examination
be
go
fast
to
decay
.
   
<EOS>
Our
next
-
door
neighbour
<EOS>
We
be
very
fond
of
speculate
as
we
walk
through
a
street
,
on
the
character
and
pursuit
of
the
people
who
inhabit
it
;
and
nothing
so
materially
assist
us
in
these
speculation
as
the
appearance
of
the
house
door
.
 
<EOS>
the
various
expression
of
the
human
countenance
afford
a
beautiful
and
interesting
study
;
but
there
be
something
in
the
physiognomy
of
street
-
door
knocker
,
almost
as
characteristic
,
and
nearly
as
infallible
.
 
<EOS>
whenever
we
visit
a
man
for
the
first
time
,
we
contemplate
the
feature
of
his
knocker
with
the
great
curiosity
,
for
we
well
know
,
that
between
the
man
and
his
knocker
,
there
will
inevitably
be
a
great
or
less
degree
of
resemblance
and
sympathy
.
   
<EOS>
for
instance
,
there
be
one
description
of
knocker
that
use
to
be
common
enough
,
but
which
be
fast
pass
away
---
a
large
round
one
,
with
the
jolly
face
of
a
convivial
lion
smile
blandly
at
you
,
as
you
twist
the
side
of
your
hair
into
a
curl
or
pull
up
your
shirt
-
collar
while
you
be
wait
for
the
door
to
be
open
;
we
never
see
that
knocker
on
the
door
of
a
churlish
man
---
so
far
as
our
experience
be
concern
,
it
invariably
bespeak
hospitality
and
another
bottle
.
   
<EOS>
no
man
ever
see
this
knocker
on
the
door
of
a
small
attorney
or
bill
-
broker
;
they
always
patronise
the
other
lion
;
a
heavy
ferocious
-
look
fellow
,
with
a
countenance
expressive
of
savage
stupidity
---
a
sort
of
grand
master
among
the
knocker
,
and
a
great
favourite
with
the
selfish
and
brutal
.
   
<EOS>
then
there
be
a
little
pert
egyptian
knocker
,
with
a
long
thin
face
,
a
pinch
-
up
nose
,
and
a
very
sharp
chin
;
he
be
most
in
vogue
with
your
government
-
office
people
,
in
light
drab
and
starched
cravat
;
little
spare
,
priggish
man
,
who
be
perfectly
satisfied
with
their
own
opinion
,
and
consider
themselves
of
paramount
importance
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
greatly
trouble
a
few
year
ago
,
by
the
innovation
of
a
new
kind
of
knocker
,
without
any
face
at
all
,
compose
of
a
wreath
depend
from
a
hand
or
small
truncheon
.
 
<EOS>
a
little
trouble
and
attention
,
however
,
enable
us
to
overcome
this
difficulty
,
and
to
reconcile
the
new
system
to
our
favourite
theory
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
invariably
find
this
knocker
on
the
door
of
cold
and
formal
people
,
who
always
ask
you
why
you
don't
come
,
and
never
say
DO
.
   
<EOS>
everybody
know
the
brass
knocker
be
common
to
suburban
villas
,
and
extensive
boarding
-
school
;
and
have
notice
this
genus
we
have
recapitulate
all
the
most
prominent
and
strongly
-
define
specie
.
   
<EOS>
some
phrenologist
affirm
,
that
the
agitation
of
a
man
's
brain
by
different
passion
,
produce
correspond
development
in
the
form
of
his
skull
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
let
us
be
understand
as
push
our
theory
to
the
full
length
of
asserting
,
that
any
alteration
in
a
man
's
disposition
would
produce
a
visible
effect
on
the
feature
of
his
knocker
.
 
<EOS>
Our
position
merely
be
,
that
in
such
a
case
,
the
magnetism
which
must
exist
between
a
man
and
his
knocker
,
would
induce
the
man
to
remove
,
and
seek
some
knocker
more
congenial
to
his
altered
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
ever
find
a
man
change
his
habitation
without
any
reasonable
pretext
,
depend
upon
it
,
that
,
although
he
may
not
be
aware
of
the
fact
himself
,
it
be
because
he
and
his
knocker
be
at
variance
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
new
theory
,
but
we
venture
to
launch
it
,
nevertheless
,
as
be
quite
as
ingenious
and
infallible
as
many
thousand
of
the
learned
speculation
which
be
daily
broach
for
public
good
and
private
fortune
-
making
.
   
<EOS>
entertain
these
feeling
on
the
subject
of
knocker
,
it
will
be
readily
imagine
with
what
consternation
we
view
the
entire
removal
of
the
knocker
from
the
door
of
the
next
house
to
the
one
we
live
in
,
some
time
ago
,
and
the
substitution
of
a
bell
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
calamity
we
have
never
anticipate
.
 
<EOS>
the
bare
idea
of
anybody
be
able
to
exist
without
a
knocker
,
appear
so
wild
and
visionary
,
that
it
have
never
for
one
instant
enter
our
imagination
.
   
<EOS>
We
saunter
moodily
from
the
spot
,
and
bent
our
step
towards
Eaton
-
square
,
then
just
build
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
our
astonishment
and
indignation
to
find
that
bell
be
fast
become
the
rule
,
and
knocker
the
exception
!
 
<EOS>
Our
theory
tremble
beneath
the
shock
.
 
<EOS>
We
hasten
home
;
and
fancy
we
foresaw
in
the
swift
progress
of
event
,
its
entire
abolition
,
resolve
from
that
day
forward
to
vent
our
speculation
on
our
next
-
door
neighbour
in
person
.
 
<EOS>
the
house
adjoin
our
on
the
left
hand
be
uninhabite
,
and
we
have
,
therefore
,
plenty
of
leisure
to
observe
our
next
-
door
neighbour
on
the
other
side
.
   
<EOS>
the
house
without
the
knocker
be
in
the
occupation
of
a
city
clerk
,
and
there
be
a
neatly

write
bill
in
the
parlour
window
intimate
that
lodging
for
a
single
gentleman
be
to
be
let
within

<EOS>
It
be
a
neat
,
dull
little
house
,
on
the
shady
side
of
the

,
with
new
,
narrow
floorcloth
in
the

,
and
new

<EOS>
the

and
the

and
all
three

there

this

during
the

and
a

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
term
be
soon
arrange

for
the
bill
be
take
down
immediately
after
his
first
visit
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
day
or
two
the
single
gentleman
come
in
,
and
shortly
afterwards
his
real
character
come
out
.
   
<EOS>
first
of
all
,
he
display
a
most
extraordinary
partiality
for
sit
up
till
three
or
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
drink
whiskey
-
and
-
water
,
and
smoke
cigar
;
then
he
invite
friend
home
,
who
use
to
come
at
ten
o'clock
,
and
begin
to
get
happy
about
the
small
hour
,
when
they
evince
their
perfect
contentment
by
singe
song
with
half
-
a
-
dozen
verse
of
two
line
each
,
and
a
chorus
of
ten
,
which
chorus
use
to
be
shout
forth
by
the
whole
strength
of
the
company
,
in
the
most
enthusiastic
and
vociferous
manner
,
to
the
great
annoyance
of
the
neighbour
,
and
the
special
discomfort
of
another
single
gentleman
overhead
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
this
be
bad
enough
,
occur
as
it
do
three
time
a
week
on
the
average
,
but
this
be
not
all
;
for
when
the
company
do
go
away
,
instead
of
walk
quietly
down
the
street
,
as
anybody
else
's
company
would
have
do
,
they
amuse
themselves
by
make
alarming
and
frightful
noise
,
and
counterfeit
the
shriek
of
female
in
distress
;
and
one
night
,
a
red
-
faced
gentleman
in
a
white
hat
knock
in
the
most
urgent
manner
at
the
door
of
the
powder
-
head
old
gentleman
at
no

,
and
when
the
powder
-
head
old
gentleman
,
who
think
one
of
his
married
daughter
must
have
be
take
ill
prematurely
,
have
grope
down

stair
,
and
<EOS>
after
a
great
deal
of
unbolting
and
key
-
turning
,
open
the
street
door
,
the
red
-
faced
man
in
the
white
hat
say
he
hope
he
would
excuse
his
give
him
so
much
trouble
,
but
he
would
feel
oblige
if
he
would
favour
him
with
a
glass
of
cold
spring
water
,
and
the
loan
of
a
shilling
for
a
cab
to
take
him
home
,
on
which
the
old
gentleman
slam
the
door
and
go
up
-
stair
,
and
throw
the
content
of
his
water
jug
out
of
window
---
very
straight
,
only
it
go
over
the
wrong
man
;
and
the
whole
street
be
involve
in
confusion
.
   
<EOS>
a
joke
be
a
joke
;
and
even
practical
jest
be
very
capital
in
their
way
,
if
you
can
only
get
the
other
party
to
see
the
fun
of
them
;
but
the
population
of
our
street
be
so
dull
of
apprehension
,
as
to
be
quite
lose
to
a
sense
of
the
drollery
of
this
proceeding
:
and
the
consequence
be
,
that
our
next
-
door
neighbour
be
oblige
to
tell
the
single
gentleman
,
that
unless
he
give
up
entertain
his
friend
at
home
,
he
really
must
be
compel
to
part
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
the
single
gentleman
receive
the
remonstrance
with
great
good
-
humour
,
and
promise
from
that
time
forward
,
to
spend
his
evening
at
a
coffee
-
house
---
a
determination
which
afford
general
and
unmixed
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
the
next
night
pass
off
very
well
,
everybody
be
delight
with
the
change
;
but
on
the
next
,
the
noise
be
renew
with
great
spirit
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
the
single
gentleman
's
friend
be
unable
to
see
him
in
his
own
house
every
alternate
night
,
have
come
to
the
determination
of
see
him
home
every
night
;
and
what
with
the
discordant
greeting
of
the
friend
at
parting
,
and
the
noise
create
by
the
single
gentleman
in
his
passage
up
-
stair
,
and
his
subsequent
struggle
to
get
his
boot
off
,
the
evil
be
not
to
be
bear
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
our
next
-
door
neighbour
give
the
single
gentleman
,
who
be
a
very
good
lodger
in
other
respect
,
notice
to
quit
;
and
the
single
gentleman
go
away
,
and
entertain
his
friend
in
other
lodging
.
   
<EOS>
the
next
applicant
for
the
vacant
first
floor
,
be
of
a
very
different
character
from
the
troublesome
single

<EOS>
when

He

---
a

who
abhor
gaiety

and
love
retirement

<EOS>
He
take
down
the

a
light
heart
,
and
picture
in
imagination
a
long
series
of
quiet
Sundays

on

he
and
his

would
exchange
mutual
civility
and
Sunday

<EOS>
whether
this

an
aversion
to

<EOS>

not

<EOS>
They

eighteen

nineteen

a

They

poor

very
poor

only
mean
of
support
arise
from
the
pittance
the
boy
earn
,
by
copy
writing
,
and
translate
for
bookseller

<EOS>
They
have
remove
from
some
country
place
and
settle
in
London
;
partly
because
it
afford
well
chance
of
employment
for
the
boy
,
and
partly
,
perhaps
,
with
the
natural
desire
to
leave
a
place
where
they
have
be
in
well
circumstance
,
and
where
their
poverty

<EOS>
They
be
proud
under
their
reverse

and
above
reveal
their
want
and
privation
to

<EOS>
how
bitter
those
privation
be

and
how
hard

remove
them

no
one
ever
know

themselves

<EOS>
night
after
night

two

three

four

after

could
we
hear

or
the
hollow

,
which
indicate
his

could
we
see

plainly
that
nature
have
set

his
plaintive

which

the
beacon
of
her
bad
disease

<EOS>
actuate

we
hope

by
a
high

we
contrive

<EOS>
first
an
acquaintance

and
then
a

with

Our

the

through

anything

<EOS>
a

<EOS>
one

His

<EOS>
We
sit
down

the

He

languidly

resolve

solemn

He
fall
back
,
and
a
strange
expression
steal
upon
his

;
not
of
pain

an
indescribable
fixing

SCENES

the

morning
the

be
well
acquaint
with
the
scene

<EOS>
there
be
an
air
of
cold
,
solitary
desolation
about
the
noiseless
street
which
we
be
accustomed
to
see
throng
at
other

by
a
busy

eager
crowd
,
and
over

the

have
just
stagger

roar
out
the
burden
of
the
drinking
song
of
the
previous
night
:
 
the
last
houseless
vagrant
whom
penury
and
police
have
leave
in
the
street
,
have
coil
up
his
chilly
limb
in
some

to
dream
of
food

warmth

the

have
not

of

stealthily

shop

what
inexhaustible

<EOS>
We
never

able
to
agree
with
Sterne
in
pity
the
man
who
could
travel
from
Dan
to
Beersheba
,
and
say
that
all
be
barren
;
we
have
not
the
slight
commiseration
for
the
man
who
can
take
up
his
hat
and
stick
,
and
walk
from
covent

garden
to
St

's
Churchyard
,
and
back
into
the

without
derive
some
amusement
<EOS>
---
we
have
almost

instruction

from
his
perambulation
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
there
be
such
being
:
 
<EOS>
we
meet
them
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
large
black
stock
and
light
waistcoat
,
jet
cane
and
discontent
countenance
,
be
the
characteristic
of
the
race
;
other
people
brush
quickly
by
you
,
steadily
plod
on
to
business
,
or
cheerfully
run
after
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
these
man
linger
listlessly
past
,
look
as
happy
and
animate
as
a
policeman
on
duty
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
seem
to
make
an
impression
on
their
mind
:
 
nothing
short
of
be
knock
down
by
a
porter
,
or
run
over
by
a
cab
,
will
disturb
their
equanimity
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
meet
them
on
a
fine
day
in
any
of
the
lead
thoroughfare
:
 
peep
through
the
window
of
a
west
-
end
cigar
shop
in
the
evening
,
if
you
can
manage
to
get
a
glimpse
between
the
blue
curtain
which
intercept
the
vulgar
gaze
,
and
you
see
them
in
their
only
enjoyment
of
existence
.
 
<EOS>
there
they
be
lounge
about
,
on
round
tub
and
pipe
box
,
in
all
the
dignity
of
whisker
,
and
gilt
watch
-
guard
;
whisper
soft
nothing
to
the
young
lady
in
amber
,
with
the
large
ear
-
ring
,
who
,
as
she
sit
behind
the
counter
in
a
blaze
of
adoration
and
gas
-
light
,
be
the
admiration
of
all
the
female
servant
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
the
envy
of
every
milliner
's
apprentice
within
two
mile
round
.
   
<EOS>
one
of
our
principal
amusement
be
to
watch
the
gradual
progress
---
the
rise
or
fall
---
of
particular
shop
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
form
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
several
,
in
different
part
of
town
,
and
be
perfectly
acquaint
with
their
whole
history
.
 
<EOS>
We
could
name
off
-
hand
,
twenty
at
least
,
which
we
be
quite
sure
have
pay
no
taxis
for
the
last
six
year
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
never
inhabit
for
more
than
two
month
consecutively
,
and
,
we
verily
believe
,
have
witness
every
retail
trade
in
the
directory
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
one
,
whose
history
be
a
sample
of
the
rest
,
in
whose
fate
we
have
take
especial
interest
,
have
have
the
pleasure
of
know
it
ever
since
it
have
be
a
shop
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
on
the
Surrey
side
of
the
water
---
a
little
distance
beyond
the
Marsh
-
gate
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
originally
a
substantial
,
good
-
look
private
house
enough
;
the
landlord
get
into
difficulty
,
the
house
get
into
Chancery
,
the
tenant
go
away
,
and
the
house
go
to
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
period
our
acquaintance
with
it
commence
;
the
paint
be
all
wear
off
;
the
window
be
break
,
the
area
be
green
with
neglect
and
the
overflowing
of
the
water
-
butt
;
the
butt
itself
be
without
a
lid
,
and
the
street
-
door
be
the
very
picture
of
misery
.
 
<EOS>
the
chief
pastime
of
the
child
in
the
vicinity
have
be
to
assemble
in
a
body
on
the
step
,
and
to
take
it
in
turn
to
knock
loud
double
knock
at
the
door
,
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
the
neighbour
generally
,
and
especially
of
the
nervous
old
lady
next
door
but
one
.
 
<EOS>
numerous
complaint
be
make
,
and
several
small
basin
of
water
discharge
over
the
offender
,
but
without
effect
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
state
of
thing
,
the
marine
-
store
dealer
at
the
corner
of
the
street
,
in
the
most
obliging
manner
take
the
knocker
off
,
and
sell
it
:
 
and
the
unfortunate
house
look
more
wretched
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
We
desert
our
friend
for
a
few
week
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
our
surprise
,
on
our
return
,
to
find
no
trace
of
its
existence
!
 
<EOS>
in
its
place
be
a
handsome
shop
,
fast
approach
to
a
state
of
completion
,
and
on
the
shutter
be
large
bill
,
inform
the
public
that
it
would
shortly
be
open
with
"
an
extensive
stock
of
linen
-
drapery
and
haberdashery
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
open
in
due
course
;
there
be
the
name
of
the
proprietor
"
and
Co.
"
in
gilt
letter
,
almost
too
dazzling
to
look
at
.
 
<EOS>
such
ribbon
and
shawl
!
<EOS>
and
two
such
elegant
young
man
behind
the
counter
,
each
in
a
clean
collar
and
white
neckcloth
,
like
the
lover
in
a
farce
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
proprietor
,
he
do
nothing
but
walk
up
and
down
the
shop
,
and
hand
seat
to
the
lady
,
and
hold
important
conversation
with
the
handsome
of
the
young
man
,
who
be
shrewdly
suspect
by
the
neighbour
to
be
the
<EOS>
"
Co.
"
 
We
see
all
this
with
sorrow
;
we
feel
a
fatal
presentiment
that
the
shop
be
doom
---
and
so
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
Its
decay
be
slow
,
but
sure
.
 
<EOS>
Tickets
gradually
appear
in
the
window
;
then
roll
of
flannel
,
with
label
on
them
,
be
stick
outside
the
door
;
then
a
bill
be
paste
on
the
street
-
door
,
intimate
that
the
first
floor
be
to
let
unfurnished
;
then
one
of
the
young
man
disappear
altogether
,
and
the
other
take
to
a
black
neckerchief
,
and
the
proprietor
take
to
drinking
.
 
<EOS>
the
shop
become
dirty
,
broken
pane
of
glass
remain
unmended
,
and
the
stock
disappear
piecemeal
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
the
company
's
man
come
to
cut
off
the
water
,
and
then
the
linen
-
draper
cut
off
himself
,
leave
the
landlord
his
compliment
and
the
key
.
   
<EOS>
the
next
occupant
be
a
fancy
stationer
.
 
<EOS>
the
shop
be
more
modestly
paint
than
before
,
still
it
be
neat
;
but
somehow
we
always
think
,
as
we
pass
,
that
it
look
like
a
poor
and
struggle
concern
.
 
<EOS>
We
wish
the
man
well
,
but
we
tremble
for
his
success
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
widower
evidently
,
and
have
employment
elsewhere
,
for
he
pass
us
every
morning
on
his
road
to
the
city
.
<EOS>
the
business
be
carry
on
by
his
eld
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
poor
girl
!
<EOS>
she
need
no
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
We
occasionally
catch
a
glimpse
of
two
or
three
child
,
in
mourn
like
herself
,
as
they
sit
in
the
little
parlour
behind
the
shop
;
and
we
never
pass
at
night
without
see
the
eld
girl
at
work
,
either
for
them
,
or
in
make
some
elegant
little
trifle
for
sale
.
 
<EOS>
We
often
think
,
as
her
pale
face
look
more
sad
and
pensive
in
the
dim
candle
-
light
,
that
if
those
thoughtless
female
who
interfere
with
the
miserable
market
of
poor
creature
such
as
these
,
know
but
one
-
half
of
the
misery
they
suffer
,
and
the
bitter
privation
they
endure
,
in
their
honourable
attempt
to
earn
a
scanty
subsistence
,
they
would
,
perhaps
,
resign
even
opportunity
for
the
gratification
of
vanity
,
and
an
immodest
love
of
self
-
display
,
rather
than
drive
them
to
a
last
dreadful
resource
,
which
it
would
shock
the
delicate
feeling
of
these
CHARITABLE
lady
to
hear
name
.
   
<EOS>
but
we
be
forget
the
shop
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
we
continue
to
watch
it
,
and
every
day
show
too
clearly
the
increase
poverty
of
its
inmate
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
be
clean
,
it
be
true
,
but
their
clothe
be
threadbare
and
shabby
;
no
tenant
have
be
procure
for
the
upper
part
of
the
house
,
from
the
letting
of
which
,
a
portion
of
the
mean
of
pay
the
rent
be
to
have
be
derive
,
and
a
slow
,
waste
consumption
prevent
the
eld
girl
from
continue
her
exertion
.
 
<EOS>
Quarter
-
day
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
the
landlord
have
suffer
from
the
extravagance
of
his
last
tenant
,
and
he
have
no
compassion
for
the
struggle
of
his
successor
;
he
put
in
an
execution
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
pass
one
morning
,
the
broker
's
man
be
remove
the
little
furniture
there
be
in
the
house
,
and
a
newly
-
post
bill
inform
us
it
be
again
"
to
let
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
what
become
of
the
last
tenant
we
never
could
learn
;
we
believe
the
girl
be
past
all
suffering
,
and
beyond
all
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
God
help
her
!
 
<EOS>
We
hope
she
be
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
somewhat
curious
to
ascertain
what
would
be
the
next
stage
---
for
that
the
place
have
no
chance
of
succeed
now
,
be
perfectly
clear
.
 
<EOS>
the
bill
be
soon
take
down
,
and
some
alteration
be
be
make
in
the
interior
of
the
shop
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
in
a
fever
of
expectation
;
we
exhaust
conjecture
---
we
imagine
all
possible
trade
,
none
of
which
be
perfectly
reconcilable
with
our
idea
of
the
gradual
decay
of
the
tenement
.
 
<EOS>
It
open
,
and
we
wonder
why
we
have
not
guess
at
the
real
state
of
the
case
before
.
 
<EOS>
the
shop
---
not
a
large
one
at
the
good
of
time
---
have
be
convert
into
two
:
 
<EOS>
one
be
a
bonnet
-
shape
maker
's
,
the
other
be
open
by
a
tobacconist
,
who
also
deal
in
walking
-
stick
and
Sunday
newspaper
;
the
two
be
separate
by
a
thin
partition
,
cover
with
tawdry
stripe
paper
.
   
<EOS>
the
tobacconist
remain
in
possession
longer
than
any
tenant
within
our
recollection
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
red
-
faced
,
impudent
,
good
-
for
-
nothing
dog
,
evidently
accustomed
to
take
thing
as
they
come
,
and
to
make
the
good
of
a
bad
job
.
 
<EOS>
He
sell
as
many
cigar
as
he
could
,
and
smoke
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
He
occupy
the
shop
as
long
as
he
could
make
peace
with
the
landlord
,
and
when
he
could
no
longer
live
in
quiet
,
he
very
coolly
lock
the
door
,
and
bolt
himself
.
 
<EOS>
from
this
period
,
the
two
little
den
have
undergo
innumerable
change
.
<EOS>
the
tobacconist
be
succeed
by
a
theatrical
hair
-
dresser
,
who
ornament
the
window
with
a
great
variety
of
"
character
,
"
and
terrific
combat
.
 
<EOS>
the
bonnet
-
shape
maker
give
place
to
a
greengrocer
,
and
the
histrionic
barber
be
succeed
,
in
his
turn
,
by
a
tailor
.
 
<EOS>
so
numerous
have
be
the
change
,
<EOS>
that
we
have
of
late
do
little
more
than
mark
<EOS>
the
peculiar
but
certain
indication
of
a
house
be
poorly
inhabit
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
progress
by
almost
imperceptible
degree
.
 
<EOS>
the
occupier
of
the
shop
have
gradually
give
up
room
after
room
,
until
they
have
only
reserve
the
little
parlour
for
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
first
there
appear
a
brass
plate
on
the
private
door
,
with
"
Ladies
'
School
"
legibly
engrave
thereon
;
shortly
afterwards
we
observe
a
second
brass
plate
,
then
a
bell
,
and
then
another
bell
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
pause
in
front
of
our
old
friend
,
and
observe
these
sign
of
poverty
,
which
be
not
to
be
mistake
,
we
think
as
we
turn
away
,
that
the
house
have
attain
its
low
pitch
of
degradation
.
<EOS>
We
be
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
last
pass
it
,
a
"
dairy
"
be
establish
in
the
area
,
and
a
party
of
melancholy
-
look
fowl
be
amuse
themselves
by
run
in
at
the
front
door
,
and
out
at
the
back
one
.
   
<EOS>
Scotland

Scotland

a

on

<EOS>
when

with
which
they
proceed
to
distant
place
up
the
country
,
and
supply
the
inhabitant
with
fuel
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
have
empty
their
waggon
,
they
again
return
for
a
fresh
supply

and
this
trade

throughout
the

<EOS>
as
the

and
a

while

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
but
the
choice
spot
in
all
Scotland
-
yard
be
the
old
public
-
house
in
the
corner
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
in
a
dark
wainscote

room
of
ancient
appearance
,
cheer
by
the
glow
of
a
mighty
fire
,
and
decorate
with
an
enormous

whereof
the

which
wreathe
heavily
above
their
head
,
and
involve
the
room
in
a
thick
dark
cloud
.
 
<EOS>
from
this
apartment
may
their
voice
be
hear
on
a
winter
's
night
,
penetrate
to
the
very
bank
of
the
river
,
as
they
shout
out
some
sturdy
chorus
,
or
roar
forth
the
burden
of
a
popular
song
;
dwell
upon
the
last
few
word
with
a
strength
and
length
of
emphasis
which
make
the
very
roof
tremble
above
them
.
   
<EOS>
here
,
too
,
would
they
tell
old
legend
of
what
the
Thames
be
in
ancient
time
,
when
the
Patent
Shot
Manufactory
be
not
build
,
and
Waterloo
-
bridge
have
never
be
think
of
;
and
then
they
would
shake
their
head
with
portentous
look
,
to
the
deep
edification
of
the
rise
generation
of
heaver
,
who
crowd
round
them
,
and
wonder
where
all
this
would
end
;
whereat
the
tailor
would
take
his
pipe
solemnly
from
his
mouth
,
and
say
,
how
that
he
hope
it
may
end
well
,
but
he
very
much
doubt
whether
it
would
or
not
,
and
could
not
rightly
tell
what
to
make
of
it
---
a
mysterious
expression
of
opinion
,
deliver
with
a
semi
-
prophetic
air
,
which
never
fail
to
elicit
the
full
concurrence
of
the
assemble
company
;
and
so
they
would
go
on
drinking
and
wonder
till
ten
o'clock
come
,
and
with
it
the
tailor
's
wife
to
fetch
him
home
,
when
the
little
party
break
up
,
to
meet
again
in
the
same
room
,
and
say
and
do
precisely
the
same
thing
,
on
the
follow
evening
at
the
same
hour
.
   
<EOS>
about
this
time
the
barge
that
come
up
the
river
begin
to
bring
vague
rumour
to
Scotland
-
yard
of
somebody
in
the
city
have
be
hear
to
say
,
that
the
Lord
Mayor
have
threaten
in
so
many
word
to
pull
down
the
old
London
-
bridge
,
and
build
up
a
new
one
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
these
rumour
be
disregard
as
idle
tale
,
wholly
destitute
of
foundation
,
for
nobody
in
Scotland
-
yard
doubt
that
if
the
Lord
Mayor
contemplate
any
such
dark
design
,
he
would
just
be
clap
up
in
the
Tower
for
a
week
or
two
,
and
then
kill
off
for
high
treason
.
   
<EOS>
by
degree
,
however
,
the
report
grow
strong
,
and
more
frequent
,
and
at
last
a
barge
,
laden
with
numerous
chaldron
of
the
good
Wallsend
,
bring
up
the
positive
intelligence
that
several
of
the
arch
of
the
old
bridge
be
stop
,
and
that
preparation
be
actually
in
progress
for
construct
the
new
one
.
 
<EOS>
what
an
excitement
be
visible
in
the
old
tap
-
room
on
that
memorable
night
!
<EOS>
each
man
look
into
his
neighbour
's
face
,
pale
with
alarm
and
astonishment
,
and
read
therein
an
echo
of
the
sentiment
which
fill
his
own
breast
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
heaver
present
prove
to
demonstration
,
that
the
moment
the
pier
be
remove
,
all
the
water
in
the
Thames
would
run
clean
off
,
and
leave
a
dry
gully
in
its
place
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
to
become
of
the
coal
-
barge
---
of
the
trade
of
Scotland
-
yard
---
of
the
very
existence
of
its
population
?
 
<EOS>
the
tailor
shake
his
head
more
sagely
than
usual
,
and
grimly
point
to
a
knife
on
the
table
,
bid
them
wait
and
see
what
happen
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
nothing
---
not
he
;
but
if
the
Lord
Mayor
do
not
fall
a
victim
to
popular
indignation
,
why
he
would
be
rather
astonished
;
that
be
all
.
   
<EOS>
They
do
wait
;
barge
after
barge
arrive
,
and
still
no
tiding
of
the
assassination
of
the
Lord
Mayor
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
stone
be
lay
:
 
it
be
do
by
a
Duke
---
the
King
's
brother
.
 
<EOS>
year
pass
away
,
and
the
bridge
be
open
by
the
King
himself
.
 
<EOS>
in
course
of
time
,
the
pier
be
remove
;
and
when
the
people
in
Scotland

yard
get
up
next
morning
in
the
confident
expectation
of
be
able
to
step
over

they
find
to
their
unspeakable
astonishment
that
the
water
be
just
where
it
use
to
be

<EOS>
a
result
so
different
from
that
which
they
have

this

its
full
effect

and
to
read

<EOS>
the
old

their

mournful

<EOS>
how

<EOS>
the

He

It

that
a

a

amidst

there

class

a
peaceable
and
retire
race

who
immure
themselves
for
the
most
part
in
deep
cellar
,
or
small
back
parlour
,
and
who
seldom
come
forth
into
the
world
,
except
in
the
dusk
and
coolness
of
the
evening
,
when
they
may
be

in

on

smoke
their

or
watch
the

of

as
they
revel
in
the
gutter
,
a
happy
troop
of
infantine
scavenger

<EOS>
Their
countenance
bear
a
thoughtful
and
a
dirty
cast
,
certain
indication
of
their
love
of
traffic
;
and
their
habitation
be
distinguish
by
that
disregard
of
outward
appearance
and
neglect
of
personal
comfort
,
so
common
among
people
who
be
constantly
immerse
in
profound
speculation

and
deeply
engage
in
sedentary

We
have
hint
at
the
antiquity
of
our
favourite
spot
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
Monmouth

street
lace
coat
"
be
a
by
-
word
a
century
ago
;
and
still
we
find
Monmouth
-
street
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
pilot
great

coat
with
wooden
button
,
have
usurp
the
place
of
the
ponderous
lace
coat
with
full
skirt
;
embroider
waistcoat
with
large
flap
,
have
yield
to
double

breasted
check
with
roll

;
and
three

corner
hat
of
quaint
appearance
,
have
give
place
to
the
low
crown
and
broad
brim
of
the
coachman
school
;
but
it
be
the
time
that
have
change
,
not
Monmouth

street
.
 
<EOS>
through
every
alteration
and
every
change
,
Monmouth
-
street
have
still
remain
the
burial
-
place
of
the
fashion
;
and
such
,
to
judge
from
all
present
appearance
,
it
will
remain
until
there
be
no
more
fashion
to
bury
.
   
<EOS>
We
love
to
walk
among
these
extensive
grove
of
the
illustrious
dead
,
and
to
indulge
in
the
speculation
to
which
they
give
rise
;
now
fit
a
deceased
coat
,
then
a
dead
pair
of
trouser
,
and
anon
the
mortal
remain
of
a
gaudy
waistcoat
,
upon
some
being
of
our
own
conjuring
up
,
and
endeavour
,
from
the
shape
and
fashion
of
the
garment
itself
,
to
bring
its
former
owner
before
our
mind
's
eye
.
<EOS>
We
have
go
on
speculate
in
this
way
,
until
whole
row
of
coat
have
start
from
their
peg
,
and
button
up
,
of
their
own
accord
,
round
the
waist
of
imaginary
wearer
;
line
of
trouser
have
jump
down
to
meet
them
;
waistcoat
have
almost
burst
with
anxiety
to
put
themselves
on
;
and
half
an
acre
of
shoe
have
suddenly
find
foot
to
fit
them
,
and
go
stump
down
the
street
with
a
noise
which
have
fairly
awaken
us
from
our
pleasant
reverie
,
and
drive
us
slowly
away
,
with
a
bewilder
stare
,
an
object
of
astonishment
to
the
good
people
of
Monmouth
-
street
,
and
of
no
slight
suspicion
to
the
policeman
at
the
opposite
street
corner
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
occupy
in
this
manner
the
other
day
,
endeavour
to
fit
a
pair
of
lace
-
up
<EOS>
half
-
boot
on
an
ideal
personage
,
<EOS>
for
whom
,
to
say
the
truth
,
they
be
full
a
couple
of
size
too
small
,
when
our
eye
happen
to
alight
on
a
few
suit
of
clothe
range
outside
a
shop
-
window
,
which
it
immediately
strike
us
,
must
at
different
period
have
all
belong
to
,
and
be
wear
by
,
the
same
individual
,
and
have
now
,
by
one
of
those
strange
conjunction
of
circumstance
which
will
occur
sometimes
,
come
to
be
expose
together
for
sale
in
the
same
shop
.
 
<EOS>
the
idea
seem
a
fantastic
one
,
and
we
look
at
the
clothe
again
with
a
firm
determination
not
to
be
easily
lead
away
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
we
be
right
;
the
more
we
look
,
the
more
we
be
convince
of
the
accuracy
of
our
previous
impression
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
man
's
whole
life
write
as
legibly
on
those
clothe
,
as
if
we
have
his
autobiography
engross
on
parchment
before
us
.
   
<EOS>
the
first
be
a
patched
and
much
-
soil
skeleton
suit
;
one
of
those
straight
blue
cloth
case
in
which
small
boy
use
to
be
confine
,
before
belt
and
tunic
have
come
in
,
and
old
notion
have
go
out
:
an
ingenious
contrivance
for
display
the
full
symmetry
of
a
boy
's
figure
,
by
fasten
him
into
a
very
tight
jacket
,
with
an
ornamental
row
of
button
over
each
shoulder
,
and
then
button
his
trouser
over
it
,
so
as
to
give
his
leg
the
appearance
of
be
hook
on
,
just
under
the
armpit
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
boy
's
dress
.
<EOS>
It
have
belong
to
a
town
boy
,
we
could
see
;
there
be
a
shortness
about
the
leg
and
arm
of
the
suit
;
and
a
bagging
at
the
knee
,
peculiar
to
the
rise
youth
of
London
street
.
 
<EOS>
a
small
day
-
school
he
have
be
at
,
evidently
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
have
be
a
regular
boy
'
school
they
would
not
have
let
him
play
on
the
floor
so
much
,
and
rub
his
knee
so
white
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
an
indulgent
mother
too
,
and
plenty
of
halfpence
,
as
the
numerous
smear
of
some
sticky
substance
about
the
pocket
,
and
just
below
the
chin
,
which
even
the
salesman
's
skill
could
not
succeed
in
disguising
,
sufficiently
betokened
.
<EOS>
They
be
decent
people
,
but
not
overburden
with
rich
,
or
he
would
not
have
so
far
outgrown
the
suit
when
he
pass
into
those
corduroy
with
the
round
jacket
;
in
which
he
go
to
a
boy
'
school
,
however
,
and
learn
to
write
---
and
in
ink
of
pretty
tolerable
blackness
,
too
,
if
the
place
where
he
use
to
wipe
his
pen
may
be
take
as
evidence
.
   
<EOS>
a
black
suit
and
the
jacket
change
into
a
diminutive
coat
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
have
die
,
and
the
mother
have
get
the
boy
a
message
-
lad
's
place
in
some
office
.
 
<EOS>
a
long
-
wear
suit
that
one
;
rusty
and
threadbare
before
it
be
lay
aside
,
but
clean
and
free
from
soil
to
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
poor
woman
!
 
<EOS>
We
could
imagine
her
assume
cheerfulness
over
the
scanty
meal
,
and
the
refusal
of
her
own
small
portion
,
that
her
hungry
boy
may
have
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Her
constant
anxiety
for
his
welfare
,
her
pride
in
his
growth
mingle
sometimes
with
the
thought
,
almost
too
acute
to
bear
,
that
as
he
grow
to
be
a
man
his
old
affection
may
cool
,
old
kindness
fade
from
his
mind
,
and
old
promise
be
forget
---
the
sharp
pain
that
even
then
a
careless
word
or
a
cold
look
would
give
her
---
all
crowd
on
our
thought
as
vividly
as
if
the
very
scene
be
pass
before
us
.
   
<EOS>
these
thing
happen
every
hour
,
and
we
all
know
it
;
and
yet
we
feel
as
much
sorrow
when
we
see
,
or
fancy
we
see
<EOS>
---
it
make
no
difference
which
---
the
change
that
begin
to
take
place
now
,
as
if
we
have
just
conceive
the
bare
possibility
of
such
a
thing
for
the
first
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
suit
,
smart
but
slovenly
;
mean
to
be
gay
,
and
yet
not
half
so
decent
as
the
threadbare
apparel
;
<EOS>
redolent
of
the
idle
lounge
,
and
the
blackguard
companion
,
tell
us
,
we
think
,
that
the
widow
's
comfort
have
rapidly
fade
away
.
 
<EOS>
We
could
imagine
that
coat
---
imagine
!
<EOS>
we
could
see
it
;
we
have
see
it
a
hundred
time
---
saunter
in
company
with
three
or
four
other
coat
of
the
same
cut
,
about
some
place
of
profligate
resort
at
night
.
   
<EOS>
We
dress
,
from
the
same
shop
-
window
in
an
instant
,
half
a
dozen
boy
of
from
fifteen
to
twenty
;
and
put
cigar
into
their
mouth
,
and
their
hand
into
their
pocket
,
watch
them
as
they
saunter
down
the
street
,
and
linger
at
the
corner
,
with
the
obscene
jest
,
and
the
oft
-
repeat
oath
.
 
<EOS>
We
never
lose
sight
of
them
,
till
they
have
cock
their
hat
a
little
more
on
one
side
,
and
swagger
into
the
public
-
house
;
and
then
we
enter
the
desolate
home
,
where
the
mother
sit
late
in
the
night
,
alone
;
we
watch
her
,
as
she
pace
the
room
in
feverish
anxiety
,
and
every
now
and
then
open
the
door
,
look
wistfully
into
the
dark
and
empty
street
,
and
again
return
,
to
be
again
and
again
disappoint
.
 
<EOS>
We
beheld
the
look
of
patience
with
which
she
bear
the
brutish
threat
,
nay
,
even
the
drunken
blow
;
and
we
hear
the
agony
of
tear
that
gush
from
her
very
heart
,
as
she
sink
upon
her
knee
in
her
solitary
and
wretched
apartment
.
   
<EOS>
a
long
period
have
elapse
,
and
a
great
change
have
take
place
,
by
the
time
of
cast
off
the
suit
that
hang
above
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
that
of
a
stout
,
broad
-
shouldered
,
sturdy
-
cheste
man
;
and
we
know
at
once
,
as
anybody
would
,
who
glance
at
that
broad
-
skirt
green
coat
,
with
the
large
metal
button
,
that
its
wearer
seldom
walk
forth
without
a
dog
at
his
heel
,
and
some
idle
ruffian
,
the
very
counterpart
of
himself
,
at
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
the
vice
of
the
boy
have
grow
with
the
man
,
and
we
fancy
his
home
then
---
if
such
a
place
deserve
the
name
.
   
<EOS>
We
see
the
bare
and
miserable
room
,
destitute
of
furniture
,
crowd
with
his
wife
and
child
,
pale
,
hungry
,
and
emaciate
;
the
man
curse
their
lamentation
,
stagger
to
the
tap
-
room
,
from
whence
he
have
just
return
,
follow
by
his
wife
and
a
sickly
infant
,
clamour
for
bread
;
and
hear
the
street
-
wrangle
and
noisy
recrimination
that
his
strike
her
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
imagination
lead
us
to
some
metropolitan
workhouse
,
situate
in
the
midst
of
crowded
street
and
alley
,
fill
with
noxious
vapour
,
and
ring
with
boisterous
cry
,
where
an
old
and
feeble
woman
,
implore
pardon
for
her
son
,
lie
die
in
a
close
dark
room
,
with
no
child
to
clasp
her
hand
,
and
no
pure
air
from
heaven
to
fan
her
brow
.
 
<EOS>
a
stranger
close
the
eye
that
settle
into
a
cold
unmeaning
glare
,
and
strange
ear
receive
the
word
that
murmur
from
the
white
and
half
-
closed
lip
.
   
<EOS>
a
coarse
round
frock
,
with
a
wear
cotton
neckerchief
,
and
other
article
of
clothing
of
the
common
description
,
complete
the
history
.
 
<EOS>
a
prison
,
and
the
sentence
---
banishment
or
the
gallow
.
<EOS>
what
would
the
man
have
give
then
,
to
be
once
again
the
contented
humble
drudge
of
his
boyish
year
;
to
have
be
restore
to
life
,
but
for
a
week
,
a
day
,
an
hour
,
a
minute
,
only
for
so
long
a
time
as
would
enable
him
to
say
one
word
of
passionate
regret
to
,
and
hear
one
sound
of
heartfelt
forgiveness
from
,
the
cold
and
ghastly
form
that
lie
rot
in
the
pauper
's
grave
!
 
<EOS>
the
child
wild
in
the
street
,
the
mother
a
destitute
widow
;
both
deeply
tainted
with
the
deep
disgrace
of
the
husband
and
father
's
name
,
and
impel
by
sheer
necessity
,
down
the
precipice
that
have
lead
him
to
a
linger
death
,
possibly
of
many
year
'
duration
,
thousand
of
mile
away
.
<EOS>
We
have
no
clue
to
the
end
of
the
tale
;
but
it
be
easy
to
guess
its
termination
.
   
<EOS>
We
take
a
step
or
two
further
on
,
and
by
way
of
restore
the
naturally
cheerful
tone
of
our
thought
,
begin
fit
visionary
foot
and
leg
into
a
cellar
-
board
full
of
boot
and
shoe
,
with
a
speed
and
accuracy
that
would
have
astonish
the
most
expert
artist
in
leather
,
living
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
one
pair
of
boot
in
particular
---
a
jolly
,
good
-
tempered
,
hearty
-
look
pair
of
top
,
that
excite
our
warm
regard
;
and
we
have
get
a
fine
,
red
-
faced
,
jovial
fellow
of
a
market
-
gardener
into
them
,
before
we
have
make
their
acquaintance
half
a
minute
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
just
the
very
thing
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
his
huge
fat
leg
bulge
over
the
top
,
and
fit
them
too
tight
to
admit
of
his
tucking
in
the
loop
he
have
pull
them
on
by
;
and
his
knee
-
cord
with
an
interval
of
stocking
;
and
his
blue
apron
tuck
up
round
his
waist
;
and
his
red
neckerchief
and
blue
coat
,
and
a
white
hat
stick
on
one
side
of
his
head
;
and
there
he
stand
with
a
broad
grin
on
his
great
red
face
,
whistle
away
,
as
if
any
other
idea
but
that
of
be
happy
and
comfortable
have
never
enter
his
brain
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
the
very
man
after
our
own
heart
;
we
know
all
about
him
;
we
have
see
him
come
up
to
covent
-
garden
in
his
green
chaise
-
cart
,
with
the
fat
,
tubby
little
horse
,
half
a
thousand
time
;
and
even
while
we
cast
an
affectionate
look
upon
his
boot
,
at
that
instant
,
<EOS>
the
form
of
a
coquettish
servant
-
maid
suddenly
spring
into
a
pair
of
Denmark
satin
shoe
that
stand
beside
them
,
and
we
at
once
recognise
the
very
girl
who
accept
his
offer
of
a
ride
,
just
on
this
side
<EOS>
the
Hammersmith
suspension
-
bridge
,
the
very
last
Tuesday
morning
we
ride
into
town
from
Richmond
.
   
<EOS>
a
very
smart
female
,
in
a
showy
bonnet
,
step
into
a
pair
of
grey
cloth
boot
,
with
black
fringe
and
binding
,
that
be
studiously
point
out
their
toe
on
the
other
side
of
the
top
-
boot
,
and
seem
very
anxious
to
engage
his
attention
,
but
we
do
not
observe
that
our
friend
the
market
-
gardener
appear
at
all
captivate
with
these
blandishment
;
for
beyond
give
a
know
wink
when
they
first
begin
,
as
if
to
imply
that
he
quite
understand
their
end
and
object
,
he
take
no
further
notice
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
His
indifference
,
however
,
be
amply
recompense
by
the
excessive
gallantry
of
a
very
old
gentleman
with
a
silver
-
head
stick
,
who
totter
into
a
pair
of
large
list
shoe
,
that
be
stand
in
one
corner
of
the
board
,
and
indulge
in
a
variety
of
gesture
expressive
of
his
admiration
of
the
lady
in
the
cloth
boot
,
to
the
immeasurable
amusement
of
a
young
fellow
we
put
into
a
pair
of

we
think
would
have
split
the

down
to
meet
him

with
laughing
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
be
look
on
at
this
little
pantomime
with
great
satisfaction
for
some
time
,
when
,
to
our
unspeakable
astonishment
,
we
perceive
that
the
whole
of
the
character
,
include
a
numerous
CORPS
DE
BALLET
of
boot
and
shoe
in
the
background
,
into
which
we
have
be
hastily
thrust
as
many
foot
as
we
could
press
into
the
service
,
be
arrange
themselves
in
order
for
dancing
;
and
some
music
strike
up
at
the
moment
,
to
it
<EOS>
they
go
without
delay
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
perfectly
delightful
to
witness
the
agility
of
the
market
-
gardener
.
 
<EOS>
Out
go
the
boot
,
first
on
one
side
,
then
on
the
other
,
then
cut
,
then
shuffle
,
then
set
to
the
Denmark
satin
,
then
advance
,
then
retreat
,
then
go
round
,
and
then
repeat
the
whole
of
the
evolution
again
,
without
appear
to
suffer
in
the
least
from
the
violence
of
the
exercise
.
   
<EOS>
nor
be
the
Denmark
satin
a
bit
behindhand
,
for
they
jump
and
bound
about
,
in
all
direction
;
and
though
they
be
neither
so
regular
,
nor
so
true
to
the
time
as
the
cloth
boot
,
still
,
as
they
seem
to
do
it
from
the
heart
,
and
to
enjoy
it
more
,
we
candidly
confes
that
we
prefer
their
style
of
dance
to
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
old
gentleman
in
the
list
shoe
be
the
most
amusing
object
in
the
whole
party
;
<EOS>
for
,
besides
his
grotesque
attempt
to
appear
youthful
,
and
amorous
,
which
be
sufficiently
entertaining
in
themselves
,
the
young
fellow
in
the
pump
manage
so
artfully
that
every
time
the
old
gentleman
advance
to
salute
the
lady
in
the
cloth
boot
,
he
tread
with
his
whole
weight
on
the
old
fellow
's
toe
,
which
make
him
roar
with
anguish
,
and
render
all
the
other
like
to
die
of
laughing
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
these
festivity
when
we
hear
a
shrill
,
and
by
no
means
musical
voice
,
exclaim
,
"
<EOS>
hope
you
will
know
me
agin

imperence

"
<EOS>
and
on
look
intently
forward
to
see
from
whence
the
sound
come
,
we
find
that
it
proceed
,
not
from
the
young
lady
in
the
cloth
boot
,
as
we
have
at
first
be
incline
to
suppose
,

from
a
bulky
lady
of
elderly
appearance
who
be
seat
in
a

of

apparently

interruption

as
we
be
conscious
that
in
the
depth
of
our
meditation
we
may
have
be
rudely
stare
at
the
old
lady
for
half
an
hour
without

Hackney

We
maintain
that
hackney

properly

belong
solely
to
the

<EOS>
We
may
be
tell
,
that
there
be
hackney

coach
stand
in
Edinburgh
;
and
not
to
go
quite
so
far
for
a
contradiction
to
our

we
may
be
remind
that
Liverpool

Manchester
,
"
and
other
large
town
"
(
as
the
Parliamentary
phrase
go
)
,
have
their
hackney

coach
stand
.
 
<EOS>
We
readily
concede
to
these
place
the
possession
of
certain
vehicle
,
which
may
look
almost
as
dirty
,
and
even
go
almost
as
slowly
,
as
London
hackney

coach
;
but
that
they
have
the
slight
claim
to
compete
with
the
metropolis
,
either
in
point
of
stand
,
driver
,
or
cattle
,
we
indignantly
deny
.
   
<EOS>
take
a
regular
,
ponderous
,
rickety
,
London
hackney
-
coach
of
the
old
school
,
and
let
any
man
have
the
boldness
to
assert
,
if
he
can
,
that
he
ever
beheld
any
object
on
the
face
of
the
earth
which
at
all
resemble
it
,
unless
,
indeed
,
it
be
another
hackney

coach
of
the

date
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
recently
observe
on
certain
stand
,
and
we
say
it
with
deep
regret
,
rather
dapper
green
chariot
,
and
coach
of
polished
yellow
,
with
four
wheel
of
the
same
colour
as
the
coach
,
whereas
it
be
perfectly
notorious
to
every
one
who
have
study
the
subject
,
that
every
wheel
ought
to
be
of
a
different
colour
,
and
a
different
size
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
innovation
,
and
,
like
other
miscalled
improvement
,
awful
sign
of
the
restlessness
of
the
public
mind
,
and
the
little
respect
pay
to
our

honour
institution

<EOS>
why
should
hackney

coach
be
clean
?
 
<EOS>
Our
ancestor
find
them
dirty
,
and
leave
them
so
.
 
<EOS>
why
should
we
,
with
a
feverish
wish
to
"
keep
move
,
"
desire
to
roll
along
at
the
rate
of
six
mile
an
hour
,
while
they
be
content
to
rumble
over
the
stone
at
four
?
 
<EOS>
these
be
solemn
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
Hackney

coach
be
part
and
parcel
of
the
law
of
the
land
;
they
be
settle
by
the
Legislature
;
plate
and
number
by
the
wisdom
of
Parliament
.
   
<EOS>
then
why
have
they
be
swamp
by
cab
and
omnibus
?
 
<EOS>
or
why
should
people
be
allow
to
ride
quickly
for
eightpence
a

,
after
Parliament
have
come
to
the
solemn
decision
that
they

<EOS>
We

a
reply

have
no

begin
a
fresh

<EOS>
Our
acquaintance
with

be
of
long
standing
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
a

half

<EOS>
We
know
all
the
regular
waterman
within
three

should

almost
tempt
to
believe
that
all

in
that
district
know
us
by
sight
too
,
if
one

half
of

<EOS>
We
take
great
interest
in
hackney

we
seldom
drive

have
a
knack
of
turn
ourselves
over
when

so

We
be

as
the

of

<EOS>
and
yet
we
never

.
 
<EOS>
We
keep
no
horse

a

enjoy
no

so
much
as

follow
our

never

it

a

They

negligently

and
a
silver
staff
in
his
hand
,
whom
we
have
no
difficulty
in
recognise
as
the
officer
of
the
Court
.
 
<EOS>
the
latter
,
indeed
,
speedily
set
our
mind
at
rest
upon
this
point
,
for
,
advance
to
our
elbow
,
and
open
a
conversation
forthwith
<EOS>
,
he
have
communicate
to
us
,
in
less
than
five
minute
,
that
he
be
the
apparitor
,
and
the
other
the
court
-
keeper
;
that
this
be
the
Arches
Court
,
and
therefore
the
counsel
wear
red
gown
,
and
the
proctor
fur
collar
;
and
that
when
the
other
Courts
sit
there
,
they
do
not
wear
red
gown
or
fur
collar
either
;
with
many
other
scrap
of
intelligence
equally
interesting
.
 
<EOS>
besides
these
two
officer
,
there
be
a
little
thin
old
man
,
with
long
grizzly
hair
,
crouch
in
a
remote
corner
,
<EOS>
whose
duty
,
our
communicative
friend
inform
us
,
be
to
ring
a
large
hand
-
bell
when
the
Court
open
in
the
morning
,
and
who
,
for
aught
his
appearance
betoken
to
the
contrary
,
may
have
be
similarly
employ
for
the
last
two
century
at
least
.
   
<EOS>
the
red
-
faced
gentleman
in
the
tortoise
-
shell
spectacle
have
get
all
the
talk
to
himself
just
then
,
and
very
well
he
be
do
it
,
too
,
only
he
speak
very
fast
,
but
that
be
habit
;
and
rather
thick
,
but
that
be
good
living
.
 
<EOS>
so
we
have
plenty
of
time
to
look
about
us
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
one
individual
who
amuse
us
mightily
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
one
of
the
bewigge
gentleman
in
the
red
robe
,
who
be
straddle
before
the
fire
in
the
centre
of
the
Court
,
in
the
attitude
of
the
brazen
Colossus
,
to
the
complete
exclusion
of
everybody
else
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
gather
up
his
robe
behind
,
in
much
the
same
manner
as
a
slovenly
woman
<EOS>
would
her
petticoat
on
a
very
dirty
day
,
in
order
that
he
may
feel
the
full
warmth
of
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
His
wig
be
put
on
all
awry
,
with
the
tail
straggle
about
his
neck
;
his
scanty
grey
trouser
and
short
black
gaiter
,
make
in
the
bad
possible
style
,
import
an
additional
inelegant
appearance
to
his
uncouth
person
;
and
his
limp
,
badly
-
starched
shirt
-
collar
almost
obscure
his
eye
.
<EOS>
We
shall
never
be
able
to
claim
any
credit
as
a
physiognomist
again
,
for
,
after
a
careful
scrutiny
of
this
gentleman
's
countenance
,
we
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
bespeak
nothing
but
conceit
and
silliness
,
when
our
friend
with
the
silver
staff
whisper
in
our
ear
that
he
be
no
other
than
a
doctor
of
civil
law
,
and
heaven
know
what
besides
.
 
<EOS>
so
of
course
we
be
mistaken
,
and
he
must
be
a
very
talented
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
conceal
it
so
well
though
---
perhaps
with
the
merciful
view
of
not
astonish
ordinary
people
too
much
---
that
you
would
suppose
him
to
be
one
of
the
stupid
dog
alive
.
   
<EOS>
the
gentleman
in
the
spectacle
have
conclude
his
judgment
,
and
a
few
minute
have
be
allow
to
elapse
,
to
afford
time
for
the
buzz
of
the
Court
to
subside
,
the
registrar
call
on
the
next
cause
,
which
be
"
the
office
of
the
Judge
promote
by
Bumple
against
Sludberry
.
"
 
<EOS>
a
general
movement
be
visible
in
the
Court
,
at
this
announcement
,
and
the
obliging
functionary
with
silver
staff
whisper
us
that
"
there
would
be
some
fun
now
,
for
this
be
a
brawling
case
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
We
be
not
render
much
the
wiser
by
this
piece
of
information
,
till
we
find
by
the
open
speech
of
the
counsel
for
the
promoter
,
that
,
under
a
half
-
obsolete
statute
of
one
of
the
Edwards
,
the
court
be
empower
to
visit
with
the
penalty
of
excommunication
,
any
person
who
should
be
prove
guilty
of
the
crime
of
"
brawl
,
"
or
"
smite
,
"
in
any
church
,
or
vestry
adjoin
thereto
;
and
it
appear
,
by
some
eight
-
and
-
twenty
affidavit
,
which
be
duly
refer
to
,
that
on
a
certain
night
,
at
a
certain
vestry
-
meeting
,
in
a
certain
parish
particularly
set
forth
,
Thomas
Sludberry
,
the
party
appear
against
in
that
suit
,
have
make
use
of
,
and
apply
to
Michael
Bumple
,
the
promoter
,
the
word
"
You
be
blow
;
"
and
that
,
on
the
say
Michael
Bumple
and
other
remonstrate
with
the
say
Thomas
Sludberry
,
on
the
impropriety
of
his
conduct
,
the
say
Thomas
Sludberry
repeat
the
aforesaid
expression
,
"
You
be
blow
;
"
and
furthermore
desire
and
request
to
know
,
whether
the
say
Michael
Bumple
"
want
anything
for
himself
;
"
add
,
"
that
if
the
say
Michael
Bumple
do
want
anything
for
himself
,
he
,
the
say
Thomas
Sludberry
,
be
the
man
to
give
it
him
;
"
at
the
same
time
make
use
of
other
heinous
and
sinful
expression
,
all
of
which
,
Bumple
submit
,
come
within
the
intent
and
meaning
of
the
Act
;
and
therefore
he
,
for
the
soul
's
health
and
chastening
of
Sludberry
,
pray
for
sentence
of
excommunication
against
him
accordingly
.
   
<EOS>
upon
these
fact
a
long
argument
be
enter
into
,
on
both
side
,
to
the
great
edification
of
a
number
of
person
interest
in
the
parochial
squabble
,
who
crowd
the
court
;
and
when
some
very
long
and
grave
speech
have
be
make
PRO
and
CON
,
the
red
-
face
gentleman
in
the
tortoise
-
shell
spectacle
take
a
review
of
the
case
,
which
occupy
half
an
hour
more
,
and
then
pronounce
upon
Sludberry
the
awful
sentence
of
excommunication
for
a
fortnight
,
and
payment
of
the
cost
of
the
suit
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
,
Sludberry
,
who
be
a
little
,
red
-
faced
,
sly
-
looking
,
ginger
-
beer
seller
,
address
the
court
,
and
say
,
if
they
would
be
good
enough
to
take
off
the
cost
,
and
excommunicate
him
for
the
term
of
his
natural
life
instead
,
it
would
be
much
more
convenient
to
him
,
for
he
never
go
to
church
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
appeal
the
gentleman
in
the
spectacle
make
no
other
reply
than
a
look
of
virtuous
indignation
;
and
Sludberry
and
his
friend
retire
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
man
with
the
silver
staff
inform
us
that
the
court
be
on
the
point
of
rise
,
we
retire
too
---
ponder
,
as
we
walk
away
,
upon
the
beautiful
spirit
of
these
ancient
ecclesiastical
law
,
the
kind
and
neighbourly
feeling
they
be
calculate
to
awaken
,
and
the
strong
attachment
to
religious
institution
which
they
can
not
fail
to
engender
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
so
lose
in
these
meditation
,
that
we
have
turn
into
the
street
,
and
run
up
against
a
door
-
post
,
before
we
recollect
where
we
be
walk
.
 
<EOS>
on
look
upwards
to
see
what
house
we
have
stumble
upon
,
the
word
"
Prerogative
-
Office
,
"
write
in
large
character
,
meet
our
eye
;
and
as
we
be
in
a
sight
-
see
humour
and
the
place
be
a
public
one
,
we
walk
in
.
   
<EOS>
the
room
into
which
we
walk
,
be
a
long
,
busy
-
look
place
,
partition
off
,
on
either
side
,
into
a
variety
of
little
box
,
in
which
a
few
clerk
be
engage
in
copy
or
examine
deed
.
<EOS>
down
the
centre
of
the
room
be
several
desk
nearly
breast
high
,
at
each
of
which
,
three
or
four
people
be
stand
,
pore
over
large
volume
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
know
that
they
be
search
for
will
,
they
attract
our
attention
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
curious
to
contrast
the
lazy
indifference
of
the
attorney
'
clerk
who
be
make
a
search
for
some
legal
purpose
,
with
the
air
of
earnestness
and
interest
which
distinguish
the
stranger
to
the
place
,
who
be
look
up
the
will
of
some
deceased
relative
;
the
former
pausing
every
now
and
then
with
an
impatient
yawn
,
or
raise
their
head
to
look
at
the
people
who
pass
up
and
down
the
room
;
the
latter
stooping
over
the
book
,
and
run
down
column
after
column
of
name
in
the
deep
abstraction
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
one
little
dirty
-
faced
man
in
a
blue
apron
,
who
after
a
whole
morning
's
search
,
extend
some
fifty
year
back
,
have
just
find
the
will
to
which
he
wish
to
refer
,
which
one
of
the
official
be
read
to
him
in
a
low
hurried
voice
from
a
thick
vellum
book
with
large
clasp
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
perfectly
evident
that
the
more
the
clerk
read
,
the
less
the
man
with
the
blue
apron
understand
about
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
volume
be
first
bring
down
,
he
take
off
his
hat
,
smooth
down
his
hair
,
smile
with
great
self
-
satisfaction
,
and
look
up
in
the
reader
's
face
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
have
make
up
his
mind
to
recollect
every
word
he
hear
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
two
or
three
line
be
intelligible
enough
;
but
then
the
technicality
begin
,
and
the
little
man
begin
to
look
rather
dubious
.
 
<EOS>
then
come
a
whole
string
of
complicated
trust
,
and
he
be
regularly
at
sea
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
reader
proceed
,
it
be
quite
apparent
that
it
be
a
hopeless
case
,
and
the
little
man
,
with
his
mouth
open
and
his
eye
fix
upon
his
face
,
look
on
with
an
expression
of
bewilderment
and
perplexity
irresistibly
ludicrous
.
   
<EOS>
a
little
further
on
,
a
hard
-
feature
old
man
with
a
deeply
-
wrinkle
face
,
be
intently
peruse
a
lengthy
will
with
the
aid
of
a
pair
of
horn
spectacle
:
 
occasionally
pause
from
his
task
,
and
slily
note
down
some
brief
memorandum
of
the
bequest
contain
in
it
.
<EOS>
every
wrinkle
about
his
toothless
mouth
,
and
sharp
keen
eye
,
tell
of
avarice
and
cunning
.
 
<EOS>
His
clothe
be
nearly
threadbare
,
but
it
be
easy
to
see
that
he
wear
them
from
choice
and
not
from
necessity
;
all
his
look
and
gesture
down
to
the
very
small
pinche
of
snuff
which
he
every
now
and
then
take
from
a
little
tin
canister
,
tell
of
wealth
,
and
penury
,
and
avarice
.
   
<EOS>
as
he
leisurely
close
the
register
,
put
up
his
spectacle
,
and
fold
his
scrap
of
paper
in
a
large
leathern
pocket
-
book
<EOS>
,
we
think
what
a
nice
hard
bargain
he
be
drive
with
some
poverty
-
stricken
legatee
,
who
,
tired
of
wait
year
after
year
,
until
some
life
-
interest
should
fall
in
,
be
sell
his
chance
,
just
as
it
begin
to
grow
most
valuable
,
for
a
twelfth
part
of
its
worth
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
good
speculation
---
a
very
safe
one
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
stow
his
pocket
-
book
carefully
in
the
breast
of
his
great
-
coat
,
and
hobble
away
with
a
leer
of
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
that
will
have
make
him
ten
year
young
at
the
low
computation
.
   
<EOS>
have
commence
our
observation
,
we
should
certainly
have
extend
them
to
another
dozen
of
people
at
least
,
have
not
a
sudden
shutting
up
and
put
away
of
the
worm

eat
old

he

<EOS>
there
be
another

a
very
different
class
of
man

whose
recreation
be
their
garden

<EOS>
an
individual
of
this
class
,
reside
some
short
distance
from
town
---
say
in
the
Hampstead

road

or
the
Kilburn

road
,
or
any
other
road
where
the
house
be
small

He
and
his

clean

---
have
occupy
the
same
house
ever
since
he
retire
from
business
twenty
year
ago
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
no
family
.
 
<EOS>
They
once
have
a
son

who
die
at
about
five
year

and
a

he
use

draw
about
,
be
carefully
preserve
as
a
relic
.
   
<EOS>
in
fine
weather
the
old
gentleman
be
almost
constantly
in
the
garden
;
and
when
it
be
too
wet
to
go
into
it
,
he
will
look
out
of
the
window
at
it
,
by
the
hour
together
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
always
something
to
do
there
,
and
you
will
see
him
dig
,
and
sweeping
,
and
cutting
,
and
planting
,
with
manifest
delight
.
 
<EOS>
in
spring
-
time
,
there
be
no
end
to
the
sowing
of
seed
,
and
stick
little
bit
of
wood
over
them
,
with
label
,
which
look
like
epitaph
to
their
memory
;
and
in
the
evening
,
when
the
sun
have
go
down
,
the
perseverance
with
which
he
lug
a
great
watering
-
pot
about
be
perfectly
astonishing
.
<EOS>
the
only
other
recreation
he
have
,
be
the
newspaper
,
which
he
peruse
every
day
,
from
begin
to
end
,
generally
read
the
most
interesting
piece
of
intelligence
to
his
wife
,
during
breakfast

<EOS>
the
old
lady
be
very
fond
of
flower

She
take
great
pride
in
the
garden
too

and
when
one
of
the

a
large
gooseberry

so
plant
the
tree
which
produce
it
,
with
his
own
hand

<EOS>
on
a
summer
's
evening
,
when
the
large
watering
-
pot
have
be
fill
and
empty
some
fourteen
time
,
and
the
old
couple
have
quite
exhaust
themselves
by
trot
about
<EOS>
,
you
will
see
them
sit
happily
together
in
the
little
summerhouse
,
enjoy
the
calm
and
peace
of
the
twilight
,
and
watch
the
shadow
as
they
fall
upon
the
garden
,
and
gradually
grow
thick
and
more
sombre
,
obscure
the
tint
of
their
gay
flower
---
no
bad
emblem
of
the
year
that
have
silently
roll
over
their
head
,
deaden
in
their
course
the
bright
hue
of
early
hope
and
feeling
which
have
long
since
fade
away
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
their
only
recreation
,
and
they
require
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
within
themselves
,
the
material
of
comfort
and
content
;
and
the
only
anxiety
of
each
,
be
to
die
before
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
no
ideal
sketch

<EOS>
there
used
to
be
many
old
people
of
this
description

their
number
may
have
diminish

and
may
decrease
still
more

unfit

that
quiet
domestic

we

some
of

reminiscence

to
put
the
question
in

more
intelligible

who

<EOS>
We
have
be
on
water
excursion
out
of

but
we
solemnly
declare
that
we
can
not
call
to
mind
one
single
occasion
of
the
kind
,
which
be
not
mark
by
more
misery
than
any
one
would
suppose
could
be
reasonably
crowd
into
the
space
of
some
eight
or
nine

<EOS>
something

always

<EOS>
either

have
come
out

or
the
most
anxiously
expect
member

have
not
come

the
most
disagreeable
man
in

would
come
out
,

a

have
fall
into

the

endanger
everybody

all
the

the
gentleman
who
volunteer
to
row
have
be
"
out
of

,
"
and
perform
very
alarming
evolution
,
put
their
oar
down
into
the
water
and
not

to
get
them
up
again
,

the
sol
of

to
the

"
in

in
a
very
humiliating
manner
.
   
<EOS>
We
grant
that
the
bank
of
the
Thames
be
very
beautiful
at
Richmond
and
Twickenham
,
and
other
distant
haven
,
often
seek
though
seldom
reach

but
from
the

us
"
back
to

bridge

the
scene
be
wonderfully
change
.
 
<EOS>
the

be
a
noble
building
,
no
doubt
,
and
the
sportive
youth
who
"
go
in
"
at
that
particular
part
of
the
river
,
on
a
summer
's
evening
,
may
be
all
very
well
in
perspective
;
but
when
you
be
oblige
to
keep
in
shore
come
home
,
and
the
young

will
colour
up
,
and
look
perseveringly
the

while

slightly

very
hard
at

you

awkward

the

although

seem
to

with

with

more
at

respite
from
his

himself
on
the
edge
of

fan
his
broad
bushy

scarcely
half

themselves

him
(
the

in
think
that
it

high

something
be
do
with
these
steam
company
,

that
as
the
Corporation
Bill
fail
to
do
it

something
else
must
;
for
really
people

property
be
not
to
be
sacrifice

as
it

convince
there

our

<EOS>
Our

taste
be
go

and
with
shame
we
confess
,
that
we
be
far
more
delighted
and
amuse
with
the
audience
,
than
with
the
pageantry
we
once
so
highly
appreciate
.
   
<EOS>
We
like
to
watch
a
regular
Astley
's
party
in
the
Easter
or
Midsummer
holiday
---
pa

ma
,
and
nine
or
ten
child

vary
from

foot
six
to
two
foot
eleven
:
 
from
fourteen
year
of
age
to

<EOS>
We
have
just
take
our
seat
in
one
of
the
box
,
in
the
centre
of
the
house
,
the
other
night
,
when
the
next
be
occupy
by
just
such
a
party
as
we
should
have
attempt
to
describe
,
have
we
depict
our
BEAU
IDEAL
of
a
group
of
Astley
's
visitor
.
   
<EOS>
first
of
all
,
there
come
three
little
boy
and
a
little
girl
,
who
,
in
pursuance
of
pa
's
direction
,
issue
in
a
very
audible
voice
from
the
box
-
door
,
occupy
the
front
row
;
then
two
more
little
girl
be
usher
in
by
a
young
lady
,
evidently
the
governess
.
<EOS>
then
come
three
more
little
boy
,
dress
like
the
first
,
in
blue
jacket
and
trouser
,
with
lie
-
down
shirt
-
collar
:
 
then
a
child
in
a
braided
frock
and
high
state
of
astonishment
,
with
very
large
round
eye
,
open
to
their
utmost
width
,
be
lift
over
the
seat
---
a
process
which
occasion
a
considerable
display
of
little
pink
leg
---
then
come
ma
and
pa
,
and
then
the
eld
son
,
a
boy
of
fourteen
year
old
,
who
be
evidently
try
to
look
as
if
he
do
not
belong
to
the
family
.
   
<EOS>
the
first
five
minute
be
occupy
in
take
the
shawl
off
the
little
girl
,
and
adjust
the
bow
which
ornament
their
hair
;
then
it
be
providentially
discover
that
one
of
the
little
boy
be
seat
behind
a
pillar
and
could
not
see
,
so
the
governess
be
stick
behind
the
pillar
,
and
the
boy
lift
into
her
place
.
 
<EOS>
then
pa
drill
the
boy
,
and
direct
the
stowing
away
of
their
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
,
and
ma
have
first
nod
and
wink
to
the
governess
to
pull
the
girl
'
frock
a
little
more
off
their
shoulder
,
stand
up
to
review
the
little
troop
---
an
inspection
which
appear
to
terminate
much
to
her
own
satisfaction
,
for
she
look
with
a
complacent
air
at
pa
,
who
be
stand
up
at
the
further
end
of
the
seat
.
 
<EOS>
Pa
return
the
glance
,
and
blow
his
nose
very
emphatically
;
and
the
poor
governess
peep
out
from
behind
the
pillar
,
and
timidly
try
to
catch
ma
's
eye
,
with
a
look
expressive
of
her
high
admiration
of
the
whole
family
.
 
<EOS>
then
two
of
the
little
boy
who
have
be
discuss
the
point
whether
Astley
's
be
more
than
twice
as
large
as
Drury
Lane
,
agree
to
refer
it
to
"
George
"
for
his
decision
;
at
which
"
George
,
"
who
be
no
other
than
the
young
gentleman
before
notice
,
wax
indignant
,
and
remonstrate
in
no
very
gentle
term
on
the
gross
impropriety
of
have
his
name
repeat
in
so
loud
a
voice
at
a
public
place
,
on
which
all
the
child
laugh
very
heartily
,
and
one
of
the
little
boy
wound
up
by
express
his
opinion
,
that
"
George
begin
to
think
himself
quite
a
man
now
,
"
whereupon
both
pa
and
ma
laugh
too
;
and
George
(
who
carry
a
dress
cane
and
be
cultivate
whisker
)
mutter
that
"
William
always
be
encourage
in
his
impertinence
;
"
and
assume
a
look
of
profound
contempt
,
which
last
the
whole
evening
.
   
<EOS>
the
play
begin
,
and
the
interest
of
the
little
boy
know
no
bound
.
<EOS>
Pa
be
clearly
interested
too
,
although
he
very
unsuccessfully
endeavour
to
look
as
if
he
be
not
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
ma
,
she
be
perfectly
overcome
by
the
drollery
of
the
principal
comedian
,
and
laugh
till
every
one
of
the
immense
bow
on
her
ample
cap
tremble
,
at
which
the
governess
peep
out
from
behind
the
pillar
again
,
and
whenever
she
could
catch
ma
's
eye
,
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
mouth
,
and
appear
,
as
in
duty
bind
,
to
be
in
convulsion
of
laughter
also
.
 
<EOS>
then
when
the
man
in
the
splendid
armour
vow
to
rescue
the
lady
or
perish
in
the
attempt
,
the
little
boy
applaud
vehemently
,
especially
one
little
fellow
who
be
apparently
on
a
visit
to
the
family
,
and
have
be
carry
on
a
child
's
flirtation
,
the
whole
evening
,
with
a
small
coquette
of
twelve
year
old
,
who
look
like
a
model
of
her
mamma
on
a
reduce
scale
;
and
who
,
in
common
with
the
other
little
girl
(
who
generally
speak
have
even
more
coquettishness
about
them
than
much
old
one
)
,
look
very
properly
shock
,
when
the
knight
's
squire
kiss
the
princess
's
confidential
chambermaid
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
scene
in
the
circle
commence
,
the
child
be
more
delighted
than
ever
;
and
the
wish
to
see
what
be
go
forward
,
completely
conquer
pa
's
dignity
,
he
stand
up
in
the
box
,
and
applaud
as
loudly
as
any
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
between
each
feat
of
horsemanship
,
the
governess
leant
across
to
ma
,
and
retail
the
clever
remark
of
the
child
on
that
which
have
precede
:
 
and
ma
,
in
the
openness
of
her
heart
,
offer
the
governess
an
acidulate
drop
,
and
the
governess
,
gratify
to
be
take
notice
of
,
retire
behind
her
pillar
again
with
a
bright
countenance
:
 
and
<EOS>
the
whole
party
seem
quite
happy
,
except
the
exquisite
in
the
back
of
the
box
,
who
,
be
too
grand
to
take
any
interest
in
the
child
,
and
too
insignificant
to
be
take
notice
of
by
anybody
else
,
occupy
himself
,
from
time
to
time
,
in
rub
the
place
where
the
whisker
ought
to
be
,
and
be
completely
alone
in
his
glory
.
   
<EOS>
We
defy
any
one
who
have
be
to
Astley
's
two
or
three
time
,
and
be
consequently
capable
of
appreciate
the
perseverance
with
which
precisely
the
same
joke
be
repeat
night
after
night
,
and
season
after
season
,
not
to
be
amuse
with
one
part
of
the
performance
at
least
---
we
mean
the
scene
in
the
circle
.
 
<EOS>
for
ourself
,
we
know
that
when
the
hoop
,
compose
of
jet
of
gas
,
be
let
down
,
the
curtain
draw
up
for
the
convenience
of
the
half
-
price
on
their
ejectment
from
the
ring
,
the
orange
-
peel
clear
away
,
and
the
sawdust
shake
,
with
mathematical
precision
,
into
a
complete
circle
,
we
feel
as
much
enliven
as
the
young
child
present
;
and
actually
join
in
the
laugh
which
follow
the
clown
's
shrill
shout
of
"
here
we
be
!
"
<EOS>
just
for
old
acquaintance
"
sake
.
 
<EOS>
nor
can
we
quite
div
ourself
of
our
old
feeling
of
reverence
for
the
riding
-
master
,
who
follow
the
clown
with
a
long
whip
in
his
hand
,
and
bow
to
the
audience
with
graceful
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
none
of
your
second

rate
riding
-
master
in
nankeen
dressing
-
gown
,
with
brown
frog
,
but
the
regular
gentleman
-
attendant
on
the
principal
rider
,
who
always
wear
a
military
uniform
with
a
table
-
cloth
inside
the
breast
of
the
coat
,
in
which
costume
<EOS>
he
forcibly
remind
one
of
a
fowl
truss
for
roasting
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
---
but
why
should
we
attempt
to
describe
that
of
which
no
description
can
convey
an
adequate
idea
?
<EOS>
everybody
know
the
man
,
and
everybody
remember
his
polished
boot
,
his
graceful
demeanour
,
stiff
,
as
some
misjudging
person
have
in
their
jealousy
consider
it
,
and
the
splendid
head
of
black
hair
,
part
high
on
the
forehead
,
to
impart
to
the
countenance
an
appearance
of
deep
thought
and
poetic
melancholy
.
<EOS>
His
soft
and
pleasing
voice
,
too
,
be
in
perfect
unison
with
his
noble
bearing
,
as
he
humour
the
clown
by
indulge
in
a
little
badinage
;
and
the
striking
recollection
of
his
own
dignity
,
with
which
he
exclaim
,
"
now
,
sir
,
if
you
please
,
inquire
for
Miss
Woolford
,
sir
,
"
can
never
be
forget
.
 
<EOS>
the
graceful
air
,
too
,
with
which
he
introduce
Miss
Woolford
into
the
arena
,
and
,
after
assist
her
to
the
saddle
,
follow
her
fairy
courser
round
the
circle
,
can
never
fail
to
create
a
deep
impression
in
the
bosom
of
every
female
servant
present
.
   
<EOS>
when
Miss
Woolford
,
and
the
horse
,
and
the
orchestra
,
all
stop
together
to
take
breath
,
he
urbanely
take
part
in
some
such
dialogue
as
the
follow
(
commence
by
the
clown
)
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
sir

"
<EOS>

"
well

"
<EOS>
(

variety
of
gymnastic
convulsion

double
himself
up

himself
look
very
like

most
hopeless

of
human
agony

the
vociferous
delight

do
any

ever
notice
the
class
of
people
,
who
hang
about
the
stage

door
of
our
minor
theatre
in
the
daytime
?
 
<EOS>
You
will
rarely
pass
one
of
these
entrance
without
see
a
group
of
three
or
four
man
converse
on
the
pavement
,
with
an
indescribable
public
-
house
-
parlour
swagger
,
and
a
kind
of
conscious
air
,
peculiar
to
people
of
this
description
.
 
<EOS>
They
always
seem
to
think
they
be
exhibit
;
the
lamp
be
ever
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
that
young
fellow
in
the
fade
brown
coat
,
and
very
full
light
green
trouser
,
pull
down
the
wristband
of
his
check
shirt
,
as
ostentatiously
as
if
it
be
of
the
fine
linen
,
and
cock
the
white
hat
of
the
summer
-
before
-
last
as
knowingly
over
his
right
eye
,
as
if
it
be
a
purchase
of
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
look
at
the
dirty
white
Berlin
glove
,
and
the
cheap
silk
handkerchief
stick
in
the
bosom
of
his
threadbare
coat
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
possible
to
see
him
for
an
instant
,
and
not
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
be
the
walk
gentleman
who
wear
a
blue
surtout
,
clean
collar
,
and
white
trouser
,
for
half
an
hour
,
and
then
shrink
into
his
wear
-
out
scanty
clothe
:
 
who
have
to
boast
night
after
night
of
his
splendid
fortune
,
with
the
painful
consciousness
of
a
pound
a
-
week
and
his
boot
to
find
;
to
talk
of
his
father
's
mansion
in
the
country
,
with
a
dreary
recollection
of
his
own
two
-
pair
back
,
in
the
New
Cut
;
and
to
be
envy
and
flatter
as
the
favour
lover
of
a
rich
heiress
,
remember
all
the
while
that
the
ex
-
dancer
at
home
be
in
the
family
way
,
and
out
of
an
engagement
?
   
<EOS>
next
to
him
,
perhaps
,
you
will
see
a
thin
pale
man
,
with
a
very
long
face
,
in
a
suit
of
shine
black
,
thoughtfully
knock
that
part
of
his
boot
which
once
have
a
heel
,
with
an
ash
stick
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
the
man
who
do
the
heavy
business
,
such
as
prosy
father
,
virtuous
servant
,
curate
,
landlord
,
and
so
forth
.
   
<EOS>
by
the
way
,
talk
of
father
,
we
should
very
much
like
to
see
some
piece
in
which
all
the
dramatis
personae
be
orphan

<EOS>
father
be
invariably
great
nuisance
on
the
stage

and
always
have
to
give
the
hero
or
heroine
a
long
explanation
of
what
be
do
before
the
curtain
rise
,
usually
commence
with
"
<EOS>
It
be
now
nineteen
year

my
dear
child

since

here
the
old

or
else
they
have
to
discover

all
of
a
sudden
,
that
somebody
whom
they
have
be
in
constant
communication
with
,
during
three
long
act
,
without
the
slight
suspicion
,
be
their
own
child

<EOS>
in
which
case
they
exclaim
,
"
ah

"

exclaim
the
child
;
and
they
fall
into
each
other
's
arm
,
and
look
over
each
other
's
shoulder
,
and
the
audience
give
three
round
of
applause
.
   
<EOS>
to
return
from
this
digression
,
we
be
about
to
say
,
that
these
be
the
sort
of
people
whom
you
see
talk
,
and
attitudinise
,
outside
the
stage
-
door
of
our
minor
theatre
.
 
<EOS>
at
Astley
's
they
be
always
more
numerous
than
at
any
other
place
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
generally
a
groom
or
two
,
sit
on
the
window

and
two

three
dirty
shabby

genteel
man
in
check
neckerchief
,
and
sallow
linen
,
lounge
about
,
and
carry
,
perhaps
,
under
one
arm
,
a
pair
of
stage
shoe
badly
wrap
up
in
a
piece
of
old
newspaper
.
 
<EOS>
some
year
ago
we
use
to
stand
looking
,
open
-
mouthed
,
at
these
man
,
with
a
feeling
of
mysterious
curiosity
,
the
very
recollection
of
which
provoke
a
smile
at
the
moment
we
be
write

<EOS>
We
could
not

before
our
eye
at
night
,
with
all
the
aid
of
light
,
music

and
artificial
flower
,
could
be
the
pale

dissipate

look
creature
we
beheld
by
day
.
   
<EOS>
We
can
hardly
believe
it
now

<EOS>
of
the
low
class
of
actor
we
have
see
something
,
and
it
require
no
great
exercise

imagination
to
identify
the
walk

with
the
"
dirty

"
the
comic

with
the

never

in

with

who
ever

him

Can
our

be

a
periodical

sort
of
spring

rash
:
 
a

cool

at

expiration
of
which
London
be
restore
to
its
old
habit
of

industry
,
as
suddenly
and
completely
as
if
nothing
have
ever
happen
to
disturb
them

<EOS>
in

proceed
to

return
from
it

in
almost
every
description

We
can
not
conscientiously
deny
the
charge
of
have
once
make
the
passage
in

van
,
accompany
by
thirteen
gentleman
,
fourteen
lady
,
an
unlimited
number
of

a

we
have
a
vague
recollection

,
in

find
ourself

eighth

on
the
top
of
a
hackney

at
something
past
four
o'clock
in
the
morning

with
a
rather
confused
idea

our
own

place
of
residence

<EOS>
We
have
grow
old
since
then

quiet

steady
:
 
like
nothing
well
than
to
spend
our
Easter

all
our

,
in
some
quiet
nook

with
people
of
whom
we
shall
never
tire

we

we
still
remember
something
of
Greenwich

resort

it

Vauxhall
-
Gardens
by
day
there
be
a
time
when
if
a
man
venture
to
wonder
how
Vauxhall
-
gardens
would
look
by
day
,
he
be
hail
with
a
shout
of
derision
at
the
absurdity
of
the
idea
.
 
<EOS>
Vauxhall
by
daylight
!
 
<EOS>
a
porter
-
pot
without
porter
,
the
House
of
Commons
without

Speaker
,
a

---
pooh
,
nonsense
,
the
thing
be
not
to
be
think
of
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
rumour
,
too
,
in
those
time
,
that
Vauxhall
-
gardens
by
day
,
be
the
scene
of
secret
and
hidden
experiment
;
that
there
,
carver
be
exercise
in
the
mystic
art
of
cut
a
moderate
-
sized
ham
into
slice
thin
enough
to
pave
the
whole
of
the
ground
;
that
beneath
the
shade
of
the
tall
tree
,
studious
man
be
constantly
engage
in
chemical
experiment
,
with
the
view
of
discover
how
much
water
a
bowl
of
negus
could
possibly
bear
;
and
that
in
some
retire
nook

themselves
,
incessantly
employ
in
reduce
fowl
to
a
mere
combination
of
skin
and
bone
.
   
<EOS>
vague
rumour
of
this
kind
,
together
with
many
other
of
a
similar
nature
,
cast
over
Vauxhall
-
garden
an
air
of
deep
mystery
;
and
as
there
be
a
great
deal
in
the
mysterious
,
there
be
no
doubt
that
to
a
good
many
people
,
at
all
event
,
the
pleasure
they
afford
be
not
a
little
enhance
by
this
very
circumstance
.
   
<EOS>
of
this
class
of
people
we
confess
to
have
make
one
.
 
<EOS>
We
love
to
wander
among
these
illuminate
grove
,
think
of
the
patient
and
laborious
research
which
have
be
carry
on
there
during
the
day
,
and
witness
their
result
in
the
supper
which
be
serve
up
beneath
the
light
of
lamp
and
to
the
sound
of
music
at
night
.
<EOS>
the
temple
and
saloon
and
cosmorama
and
fountain
glitter
and
sparkle
before
our
eye
;
the
beauty
of
the
lady
singer
and
the
elegant
deportment
of
the
gentleman
,
captivate
our
heart
;
a
few
hundred
thousand
of
additional
lamp
dazzle
our
sense
;
a
bowl
or
two
of
punch
bewilder
our
brain
;
and
we
be
happy
.
   
<EOS>
in
an
evil
hour
,
the
proprietor
of
Vauxhall
-
gardens
take
to
open
them
by
day
.
 
<EOS>
We
regret
this
,
as
rudely
and
harshly
disturb
that
veil
of
mystery
which
have
hang
about
the
property
for
many
year
,
and
which
none
but
the
noonday
sun
,
and
the
late
Mr
Simpson
,
have
ever
penetrate
.
 
<EOS>
We
shrink
from
go
;
at
this
moment
we
scarcely
know
why
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
a
morbid
consciousness
of
approach
disappointment
---
perhaps
a
fatal
presentiment
---
perhaps
the
weather
;
whatever
it
be
,
we
do
not
go
until
the
second
or
third
announcement
of
a
race
between
two
balloon
tempt
us
,
and
we
go
.
   
<EOS>
We
pay
our
shilling
at
the
gate
,
and
then
we
see
for
the
first
time
,
<EOS>
that
the
entrance
,
if
there
have
be
any
magic
about
it
at
all
,
be
now
decidedly
disenchanted
,
be
,
in
fact
,
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
combination
of
very
roughly
-
paint
board
and
sawdust
.
 
<EOS>
We
glance
at
the
orchestra
and
supper
-
room
as
we
hurry
past
---
we
just
recognise
them
,
and
that
be
all
.
 
<EOS>
We
bend
our
step
to
the
firework
-
ground
;
there
,
at
least
,
we
should
not
be
disappoint
.
 
<EOS>
We
reach
it
,
and
stand
root
to
the
spot
with
mortification
and
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
that
the
moorish
tower
---
that
wooden
shed
with
a
door
in
the
centre
,
and
daub
of
crimson
and
yellow
<EOS>
all
round
,
like
a
gigantic
watch
-
case
!
 
<EOS>
that
<EOS>
the
place
where
night
after
night
we
have
behold
the
undaunted
Mr
Blackmore
make
his
terrific
ascent
,
surround
by
flame
of
fire
,
and
peal
of
artillery
,
and
where
the
white
garment
of
Madame
Somebody
(
we
forget
even
her
name
now
)
,
who
nobly
devote
her
life
to
the
manufacture
of
firework
,
have
so
often
be
see
flutter
in
the
wind
,
as
she
call
up
a
red
,
blue
,
or
party
-
colour
light
to
illumine
her
temple
!
 
<EOS>
that
<EOS>
the
---
but
at
this
moment
the
bell
rung
;
the
people
scamper
away
,
pell
-
mell
,
to
the
spot
from
whence
the
sound
proceed
;
and
we
,
from
the
mere
force
of
habit
,
find
ourself
run
among
the
first
,
as
if
for
very
life
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
for
the
concert
in
the
orchestra
.
 
<EOS>
a
small
party
of
dismal
man
in
cock
hat
be
"
execute
"
the
overture
to
TANCREDI
,
and
a
numerous
assemblage
of
lady
and
gentleman
,
with
their
family
,
have
rush
from
their
half
-
empty
stout
mug
in
the
supper
box
,
and
crowd
to
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
Intense
be
the
low
murmur
of
admiration
when
a
particularly
small
gentleman
,
in
a
dress
coat
,
lead
on
a
particularly
tall
lady
in
a
blue
sarcenet
pelisse
and
bonnet
of
the
same
,
ornament
with
large
white
feather
,
and
forthwith
commence
a
plaintive
duet
.
   
<EOS>
We
know
<EOS>
the
small
gentleman
well
;
we
have
see
a
lithograph
semblance
of
him
,
on
many
a
piece
of
music
,
with
his
mouth
wide
open
as
if
in
the
act
of
singe
;
a
wine
-
glass
in
his
hand
;
and
a
table
with
two
decanter
and
four
pine
-
apple
on
it
in
the
background
.
 
<EOS>
the
tall
lady
,
too
,
we
have
gaze
on
,
lose
in
rapture
of
admiration
,
many
and
many
a
time
<EOS>
---
how
different
people
do
look
by
daylight
,
and
without
punch
,
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
beautiful
duet
:
 
<EOS>
first
the
small
gentleman
ask
a
question
,
and
then
the
tall
lady
answer
it
;
then
the
small
gentleman
and
the
tall
lady
sing
together
most
melodiously
;
then
the
small
gentleman
go
through
a
little
piece
of
vehemence
by
himself
,
and
get
very
tenor
indeed
,
in
the
excitement
of
his
feeling
,
to
which
the
tall
lady
respond
in
a
similar
manner
;
then
the
small
gentleman
have
a
shake
or
two
,
after
which
the
tall
lady
have
the
same
,
and
then
they
both
merge
imperceptibly
into
the
original
air
:
 
and
the
band
wound
themselves
up
to
a
pitch
of
fury
,
and
the
small
gentleman
hand
the
tall
lady
out
,
and
the
applause
be
rapturous
.
   
<EOS>
the
comic
singer
,
however
,
be
the
especial
favourite
;
we
really
think
that
a
gentleman
,
with
his
dinner
in
a
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
who
stand
near
us
,
would
have
faint
with
excess
of
joy
.
 
<EOS>
a
marvellously
facetious
gentleman
that
comic
singer
be
;
his
distinguish
characteristic
be
,
a
wig
approach
to
the
flaxen
,
and
an
aged
countenance
,
and
he
bear
the
name
of
one
of
the
english
county
,
if
we
recollect
right
.
 
<EOS>
He
sing
a
very
good
song
about
the
seven
age
,
the
first
half
-
hour
of
which
afford
the
assembly
the
pure
delight
;
of
the
rest
we
can
make
no
report
,
as
we
do
not
stay
to
hear
any
more
.
   
<EOS>
We
walk
about
,
and
meet
with
a
disappointment
at
every
turn
;
our
favourite
view
be
mere
patch
of
paint
;
the
fountain
that
have
sparkle
so
showily
by
lamp
-
light
,
present
very
much
the
appearance
of
a
water
-
pipe
that
have
burst
;
all
the
ornament
be
dingy
,
and
all
the
walks
gloomy
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
spectral
attempt
at
rope
-
dancing
in
the
little
open
theatre
.
 
<EOS>
the
sun
shine
upon
the
spangle
dress
of
the
performer
,
and
their
evolution
be
about
as
inspirit
and
appropriate
as
a
country
-
dance
in
a
family
vault
.
 
<EOS>
so
we
retrace
our
step
to
the
firework
-
ground
,
and
mingle
with
the
little
crowd
of
people
who
be
contemplate
Mr
Green
.
   
<EOS>
some
half
-
dozen
man
be
restrain
the
impetuosity
of
one
of
the
balloon
,
which
be
completely
fill
,
and
have
the
car
already
attach
;
and
as
rumour
have
go
abroad
that
a
Lord
be
"
go
up
,
"
the
crowd
be
more
than
usually
anxious
and
talkative
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
one
little
man
in
fade
black
,
with
a
dirty
face
and
a
rusty
black
neckerchief
with
a
red
border
,

in

wisp

round
his

who
enter
into
conversation
with
everybody
,
and
have
something
to
say
upon
every
remark
that
be
make
within
his
hearing

<EOS>
He
be
stand
with
his
arm
fold
,
stare
up
at
the
balloon
,
and
every
now
and
then
vent
his
feeling
of
reverence
for
the
aeronaut
,
by
say
,
as
he
look
round
to
catch
somebody
's
eye
,
"
He
be
a
rum

un
be
Green
;
think
o

<EOS>
this
here
be
up'ards
of
his
two
hundredth
ascent
<EOS>
;
ecod
,
the
man
as
be
ekal
to
Green
never
have
the
toothache
yet
,
nor
will
not
have
within
this
hundred
year
,
and
that
be
all
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
when
you
meet
with
real
talent
,
and
native
,
too
,
encourage
it
<EOS>
,
that
be
what
I
say
;
"
and
when
he
have
deliver
himself
to
this
effect
,
he
would
fold
his
arm
with
more
determination
than
ever
,
and
stare
at
the
balloon
with
a
sort
of
admire
defiance
of
any
other
man
alive
,
beyond
himself
and
Green
,
that
impress
the
crowd
with
the
opinion
that
he
be
an
oracle
.
   
<EOS>
"
ah
,
you
be
very
right
,
sir
,
"
say
another
gentleman
,
with
his
wife
,
and
child
,
and
mother
,
and
wife
's
sister
,
and
a
host
of
female
friend
,
in
all
the
gentility
of
white
pocket

frill

and
spencer
,
"
Mr

be
a
steady

there
be
no
fear
about
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
fear
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
little
man
:
 
<EOS>
"
be
not
it
a
lovely
thing
to
see
him
and
his
wife
a
go
up
in
one
balloon
,
and
his
own
son
and
his
wife
a
jostling
up
against
them
in
another
,
and
all
of
them
go
twenty
or
thirty
mile
in
three
hour
or
so
,
and
then
come
back
in
pochayse
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
<EOS>
where
this
here
science
be
to
stop
,
mind
you
;
that
be
what
bother
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
here
there
be
a
considerable
talking
among
the
female
in
the
spencer
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
lady
a
laughing
at
,
sir
?
"
inquire
the
little
man
,
condescendingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
only
my
sister
Mary
,
"
say
one
of
the
girl
,
"
as
say
she
hope
his
lordship
will
not
be
frightened
when
he
be
in
the
car
,
and
want
to
come
out
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
make
yourself
easy
about
that
there
,
my
dear
,
"
reply
the
little
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
he
be
so
much
as
to
move
a
inch
without
leave
,
Green
would
jist
fetch
him
a
crack
over
the
head
with
the
telescope
,
as
would
send
him
into
the
bottom
of
the
basket
in
no
time
,
and
stun
him
till
they
come
down
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
he
,
though
?
"
inquire
the
other
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
would
he
,
"
reply
the
little
one
,
"
and
think
nothing
of
it
,
neither
,
if
he
be
the
king
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Green
's
presence
of
mind
be
wonderful
.
"
   
<EOS>
just
at
this
moment
all
eye
be
direct
to
the
preparation
which
be
be
make
for
start
.
 
<EOS>
the
car
be
attach
to
the
second
balloon
,
the
two
be
bring
pretty
close
together
,
and
a
military
band
commence
playing
,
with
a
zeal
and
fervour
which
would
render
the
most
timid
man
in
existence
but
too
happy
to
accept
any
mean
of
quit
that
particular
spot
of
earth
on
which
they
be
station
.
 
<EOS>
then
Mr
Green
,
sen
.
,
and
his
noble
companion
enter
one
car
,
and
Mr
Green
,
jun
.
,
and
his
companion
the
other
;
and
then
the
balloon
go
up
,
and
the
aerial
traveller
stand
up
,
and
the
crowd
outside
roar
with
delight
,
and
the
two
gentleman
who
have
never
ascend
before
,
try
to
wave
their
flag
,
as
if
they
be
not
nervous
,
but
hold
on
very
fast
all
the
while
;
and
the
balloon
be
waft
gently
away
,
our
little
friend
solemnly
protest
,
long
after
they
be
reduce
to
mere
speck
in
the
air
,
that
he
could
still
distinguish
the
white
hat
of
Mr
Green
.
 
<EOS>
the
garden
disgorge
their
multitude
,
boy
run
up
and
down
scream
"
bal
-
loon
;
"
and
in
all
the
crowded
thoroughfare
people
rush
out
of
their
shop
into
the
middle
of
the
road
,
and
have
stare
up
in
the
air
at
two
little
black
object
till
they
almost
dislocate
their
neck
,
walk
slowly
in
again
,
perfectly
satisfied
.
   
<EOS>
the
next
day
there
be
a
grand
account
of
the
ascent
in
the
morning
paper
,
and
the
public
be
inform
how
it
be
the
fine
day
but
four
in
Mr
Green
's
remembrance
;
how
they
retain
sight
of
the
earth
till
they
lose
it
behind
the
cloud
;
and
how
the
reflection
of
the
balloon
on
the
undulate
masse
of
vapour
be
gorgeously
picturesque
;
together
with
a
little
science
about
the
refraction
of
the
sun
's
ray
,
and
some
mysterious
hint
respect
atmospheric
heat
and
eddy
current
of
air
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
also
an
interesting
account
how
a
man
in
a
boat
be
distinctly
hear
by
Mr
Green
,
jun
.
,
to
exclaim
,
"
My
eye
!
"
<EOS>
which
Mr
Green
,
jun
.
,
attribute
to
his
voice
rise
to
the
balloon
,
and
the
sound
be
throw
back
from
its
surface
into
the
car
;
and
the
whole
conclude
with
a
slight
allusion
to
another
ascent
next
Wednesday
,
all
of
which
be
very
instructive
and
very
amusing
,
as
our
reader
will
see
if
they
look
to
the
paper
.
 
<EOS>
if
we
have
forget
to
mention
the
date
,
they
have
only
to
wait
till
next
summer
,
and
take
the
account
of
the
first
ascent
,
and
it
will
answer
the
purpose
equally
well
.
   
<EOS>
early
coach
<EOS>
We
have
often
wonder
how
many
month
'
incessant
travel
in
a
post
-
chaise
it
would
take
to
kill
a
man
;
and
wonder
by
analogy
,
we
should
very
much
like
to
know
how
many
month
of
constant
travelling
in
a
succession
of
early
coach
,
an
unfortunate
mortal
could
endure
.
 
<EOS>
break
a
man
alive
upon
the
wheel
,
would
be
nothing
to
break
his
rest
,
his
peace
,
his
heart
---
everything
but
<EOS>
his
fast
---
upon
four
;
and
the
punishment
of
Ixion
(
the
only
practical
person
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
who
have
discover
the
secret
of
the
perpetual
motion
)
would
sink
into
utter
insignificance
before
the
one
we
have
suggest
.
 
<EOS>
if
we
have
be
a
powerful
churchman
in
those
good
time
when
blood
be
shed
as
freely
as
water
,
and
man
be
mow
down
like
grass
,
in
the
sacred
cause
of
religion
,
we
would
have
lain
by
very
quietly
till
we
get
hold
of
some
especially
obstinate
miscreant
,
who
positively
refuse
to
be
convert
to
our
faith
,
and
then
we
would
have
book
him
for
an
inside
place
in
a
small
coach
,
which
travel
day
and
night
:
 
and
secure
the
remainder
of
the
place
for
stout
man
with
a
slight
tendency
to
cough
and
spit
,
we
would
have
start
him
forth
on
his
last
travel
:
 
leave
him
mercilessly
to
all
the
torture
which
the
waiter
,
landlord
,
coachman
,
guard
,
boot
,
chambermaid
,
and
other
familiar
on
his
line
of
road
,
may
think
proper
to
inflict
.
   
<EOS>
who
have
not
experience
the
misery
inevitably
consequent
upon
a
summon
to
undertake
a
hasty
journey
?
 
<EOS>
You
receive
an
intimation
from
your
place
of
business
---
wherever
that
may
be
,
or
whatever
you
may
be
---
that
it
will
be
necessary
to
leave
town
without
delay
.
<EOS>
You
and
your
family
be
forthwith
throw
into
a
state
of
tremendous
excitement
;
an
express
be
immediately
dispatch
to
the
washerwoman
's
;
everybody
be
in
a
bustle
;
and
you
,
yourself
,
with
a
feeling
of
dignity
which
you
can
not
altogether
conceal
,
sally
forth
to
the
booking
-
office
to
secure
your
place
.
 
<EOS>
here
a
painful
consciousness
of
your
own
unimportance
first
rush
on
your
mind
---
the
people
be
as
cool
and
collect
as
if
nobody
be
go
out
of
town
,
or
as
if
a
journey
of
a
hundred
odd
mile
be
a
mere
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
You
enter
a
mouldy
-
looking
room
,
ornament
with
large
posting
-
bill
;
the
great
part
of
the
place
enclose
behind
a
huge
,
lumbering
,
rough
counter
,
and
fit
up
with
recess
that
look
like
the
den
of
the
small
animal
in
a
travel
menagerie
,
without
the
bar
.
 
<EOS>
some
half

dozen
people
be
"

brown

paper
parcel
,
which
one
of
the
clerk
fling
into
the
aforesaid
recess
with
an
air
of
recklessness
which
you
,
remember
the
new
carpet

bag
you
buy
in
the

,
feel
considerably
annoy
at
;
porter
,
look
like
so
many
atlas
,
keep
rush
in
and
out
,
with
large
package
on
their
shoulder
;
and
while
you
be
wait
to
make
the
necessary
inquiry
,
you
wonder
what
on
earth
the
booking
-
office
clerk
can
have
be
before
they
be
booking
-
office
clerk
;
one
of
them
with
his
pen
behind
his
ear
,
and
his
hand
behind
him
,
be
stand
in
front
of
the
fire
,
like
a
full
-
length
portrait
of
Napoleon
;
the
other
with
his
hat
half
off
his
head
,
enter
the
passenger
'
name
in
the
book
with
a
coolness
which
be
inexpressibly
provoking
;
and
the
villain
whistle
---
actually
whistle
---
while
a
man
ask
him
what
the
fare
be
outside
,
all
the
way
to
Holyhead
!
<EOS>
---
in
frosty
weather
,
too
!
<EOS>
They
be
clearly
an
isolate
race
,
evidently
possess
no
sympathy
or
feeling
in
common
with
the
rest
of
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
Your
turn
come
at
last
,
and
have
pay
the
fare
,
you
tremblingly
inquire
---
<EOS>
"
what
time
will
it
be
necessary
for
me
to
be
here
in
the
morning
?
"
---
"
six
o'clock
,
"
reply
the
whistler
,
carelessly
pitch
the
sovereign
you
have
just
part
with
,
into
a
wooden
bowl
on
the
desk
.
 
<EOS>
"
rather
before
than
arter

"
add
the
man
with
the
semi
-
roasted
unmentionable
,
with
just
as
much
ease
and
complacency
as
if
the
whole
world
get
out
of
bed
at
five
.
 
<EOS>
You
turn
into
the
street
,
ruminate
as
you
bend
your
step
homeward
on
the
extent
to
which
man
become
harden
in
cruelty
,
by
custom
.
   
<EOS>
if
there
be
one
thing
in
existence
more
miserable
than
another
,
it
most
unquestionably
be
the
be
compel
to
rise
by
candlelight
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
ever
doubt
the
fact
,
you
be
painfully
convinced
of
your
error
,
on
the
morning
of
your
departure
.
 
<EOS>
You
leave
strict
order
,
overnight
,
to
be
call
at
half
-
past
four
,
and
you
have
do
nothing
all
night
but
doze
for
five
minute
at
a
time
,
and
start
up
suddenly
from
a
terrific
dream
of
a
large
church
-
clock
with
the
small
hand
run
round
,
with
astonishing
rapidity
,
to
every
figure
on
the
dial

plate
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
completely
exhausted
,
you
fall
gradually
into
a
refreshing
sleep
---
your
thought
grow
confused
---
the
stage
-
coach
,
which
have
be
"
go
off
"
before
your
eye
all
night
,
become
less
and
less
distinct
,
until
they
go
off
altogether
;
one
moment
you
be
drive
with
all
the
skill
and
smartness
of
an
experienced

---
the
next
you
be
exhibit

anon
you
be
closely
muffled
up

inside

and
have
just
recognise
in
the
person
of
the
guard
an
old
schoolfellow
,
whose
funeral
,
even
in
your
dream
,
you
remember
to
have
attend
eighteen
year

<EOS>
at
last
you
fall
into
a
state
of
complete
oblivion
,
from
which
you
be
arouse
,
as

into
a
new
state
of

,
by
a
singular
illusion

<EOS>
You

how

you
do
not

there
you

<EOS>
You
make
a
violent

and
start
up
in

.
<EOS>
the
vision
be
at
once
dispel
;
the

be
your

and
the

you
undergo

in

have
carefully

You

complete

You
look

as

and
look
forward
as
anxiously
to
the
termination

our
journey
,
as
we
fear
our
reader
will
have
do
,
long
since
,
to
the
conclusion
of
our
paper
.
   
<EOS>
omnibuse
<EOS>
It
be
very
generally
allow
that
public
conveyance
afford
an
extensive
field
for
amusement
and
observation
.
 
<EOS>
of
all
the
public
conveyance
that
have
be
construct
since
the
day
of
the
Ark
<EOS>
---
we
think
that
be
the
early
on
record
---
to
the
present
time
,
commend
us
to
an
omnibus
.
 
<EOS>
a
long
stage
be
not
to
be
despise
,
but
there
you
have
only
six
inside
,
and
the
chance
be
,
that
the
same
people
go
all
the
way
with
you
---
<EOS>
there
be
no
change
,
no
variety
.
<EOS>
besides
,
after
the
first
twelve
hour
or
so
,
people
get
cross
and
sleepy
,
and
when
you
have
see
a
man
in
his
nightcap
,
you
lose
all
respect
for
him
;
at
least
,
that
be
the
case
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
then
on
smooth
road
people
frequently
get
prosy
,
and
tell
long
story
,
and
even
those
who
do
not
talk
,
may
have
very
unpleasant
predilection
.
 
<EOS>
We
once
travel
four
hundred
mile
,
inside
a
stage
-
coach
,
with
a
stout
man
,
who
have
a
glass
of
rum
-
and
-
water
,
warm
,
hand
in
at
the
window
at
every
place
where
we
change
horse
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
decidedly
unpleasant
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
also
travel
occasionally
,
with
a
small
boy
of
a
pale
aspect
,
with
light
hair
,
and
no
perceptible
neck
,
come
up
to
town
from
school
under
the
protection
of
the
guard
,
and
direct
to
be
leave
at
the
Cross
Keys
till
call
for
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
,
perhaps
,
even
bad
than
rum
-
and
-
water
in
a
close
atmosphere
.
 
<EOS>
then
there
be
the
whole
train
of
evil
consequent
on
a
change
of
the
coachman
;
and
the
misery
of
the
discovery
---
which
the
guard
be
sure
to
make
the
moment
you
begin
to
doze
---
that
he
want
a
brown
-
paper
parcel
,
which
he
distinctly
remember
to
have
deposit
under
the
seat
on
which
you
be
repose
.
 
<EOS>
a
great
deal
of
bustle
and
grope
take
place
,
and
when
you
be
thoroughly
awaken
,
and
severely
cramp
,
by
hold
your
leg
up
by
an
almost
supernatural
exertion
,
while
he
be
look
behind
them
,
it
suddenly
occur
to
him
that
he
put
it
in
the
fore
-
boot
.
 
<EOS>
Bang
go
the
door
;
the
parcel
be
immediately
find
;
off
start
the
coach
again
;
and
the
guard
play
the
key
-
bugle
as
loud
as
he
can
play
it
,
as
if
in
mockery
of
your
wretchedness
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
you
meet
with
none
of
these
affliction
in
an
omnibus
;
sameness
there
can
never
be
.
 
<EOS>
the
passenger
change
as
often
in
the
course
of
one
journey
as
the
figure
in
a
kaleidoscope
,
and
though
not
so
glittering
,
be
far
more
amusing
.
 
<EOS>
We
believe
there
be
no
instance
on
record
,
of
a
man
's
have
go
to
sleep
in
one
of
these
vehicle
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
long
story
,
would
any
man
venture
to
tell
a
long
story
in
an
omnibus
?
<EOS>
and
even
if
he
do
,
where
would
be
the
harm
?
<EOS>
nobody
could
possibly
hear
what
he
be
talk
about
.
 
<EOS>
again
;
child
,
though
occasionally
,
be
not
often
to
be
find
in
an
omnibus
;
and
even
when
they
be
,
if
the
vehicle
be
full
,
as
be
generally
the
case
,
somebody
sit
upon
them
,
and
we
be
unconscious
of
their
presence
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
after
mature
reflection
,
and
considerable
experience
,
we
be
decidedly
of
opinion
,
that
of
all
know
vehicle
,
from
the
glass
-
coach
in
which
we
be
take
to
be
christen
,
to
that
sombre
caravan
in
which
we
must
one
day
make
our
last
earthly
journey
,
there
be
nothing
like
an
omnibus
.
   
<EOS>
We
will
back
the
machine
in
which
we
make
our
daily
peregrination
from
the
top
of
Oxford
-
street
to
the
city
,
against
any
"
buss
"
on
the
road
,
whether
it
be
for
the
gaudiness
of
its
exterior
,
the
perfect
simplicity
of
its
interior
,
or
the
native
coolness
of
its
cad
.
 
<EOS>
this
young
gentleman
be
a
singular
instance
of
self
-
devotion
;
his
somewhat
intemperate
zeal
on
behalf
of
his
employer
,
be
constantly
get
him
into
trouble
,
and
occasionally
into
the
house
of
correction
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
emancipate
,
however
,
than
he
resume
the
duty
of
his
profession
with
unabated
ardour
.
 
<EOS>
His
principal
distinction
be
his
activity
.
 
<EOS>
His
great
boast
be
,
"
that
he
can
chuck
an
old
gen'lm'n

shut
him
in

off

a
feat

amusement

somehow

will
contain

<EOS>
the
impression
on

evidently
be

amply

up

they
generally
occupy
the

seat

they
be
always
dress
in
the

manner

and
invariably
discuss
the
same
topic
---
the
increase
rapidity
of
cabs
,
and
the
disregard
of
moral
obligation
evince
by
omnibus
man
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
testy
old
man

with

who

sit

side

He
be
extremely
impatient

sit
there
for
the
purpose
of
keep
a
sharp
eye
on
the
cad

with
whom
he
generally
hold
a
running
dialogue

<EOS>
He
be
very
officious
in
help
people
in

out

and
always
volunteer
to
give
the

a
poke
with
his
umbrella
,
when
any

want
to
alight

<EOS>
He
usually
recommend
lady
to
have
sixpence
ready

to
prevent
delay

and
if
anybody
put
a
window
down
,
that
he
can
reach

he
immediately
put
it
up
again

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
here
the
young
man
in
the
omnibus
laugh
very
heartily
,
and
the
old
gentleman
get
very
red
in
the
face
,
and
seem
highly
exasperate
.
   
<EOS>
the
stout
gentleman
in
the
white
neckcloth
,
at
the
other
end
of
the
vehicle
,
look
very
prophetic
,
and
say
that
something
must
shortly
be
do
with
these
fellow
,
or
there
be
no
saying
where
all
this
will
end
;
and
the
shabby

genteel
man
with
the
green
bag
,
express
his
entire
concurrence
in
the
opinion
,
as
he
have
do
regularly
every
morning
for
the
last
six
month
.
   
<EOS>
a
second
omnibus
now
come
up
,
and
stop
immediately
behind
us
.
<EOS>
another
old
gentleman
elevate
his
cane
in
the
air
,
and
run
with
all
his
might
towards
our
omnibus
;
we
watch
his
progress
with
great
interest
;
the
door
be
open
to
receive
him
,
he
suddenly
disappear
---
he
have
be
spirit
away
by
the
opposition
.
 
<EOS>
Hereupon
<EOS>
the
driver
of
the
opposition
taunt
our
people
with
his
have
"
regularly
do
'em
out
of
that
old
swell
,
"
and
the
voice
of
the
"
old
swell
"
be
hear
,
vainly
protest
against
this
unlawful
detention
.
 
<EOS>
We
rattle
off
,
the
other
omnibus
rattle
after
us
,
and
every
time
we
stop
to
take
up
a
passenger
,
they
stop
to
take
him
too
;
sometimes
we
get
him
;
sometimes
they
get
him
;
but
whoever
do
not
get
him
,
say
they
ought
to
have
have
him
,
and
the
cad
of
the
respective
vehicle
abuse
one
another
accordingly
.
   
<EOS>
as
we
arrive
in
the
vicinity
of
Lincoln's
-
inn
-
field
,
Bedford
-
row
,
and
other
legal
haunt
,
we
drop
a
great
many
of
our
original
passenger
,
and
take
up
fresh
one
,
who
meet
with
a
very
sulky
reception
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
rather
remarkable
,
that
the
people
already
in
an
omnibus
,
always
look
at
newcomer
,
as
if
they
entertain
some
undefined
idea
that
they
have
no
business
to
come
in
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
quite
persuade
the
little
old
man
have
some
notion
of
this
kind
,
and
that
he
consider
their
entry
as
a
sort
of
negative
impertinence
.
   
<EOS>
conversation
be
now
entirely
drop
;
each
person
gaze
vacantly
through
the
window
in
front
of
him
,
and
everybody
think
that
his
opposite
neighbour
be
stare
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
if
one
man
get
out
at
Shoe

lane
,
and
another
at
the
corner
of
Farringdon

street
,
the
little
old
gentleman
grumble
,
and
suggest
to
the
latter
,
that
if
he
have
get
out
at
Shoe
-
lane
too
,
he
would
have
save
them
the
delay
of
another
stoppage
;
whereupon
the
young
man
laugh
again
,
and
the
old
gentleman
look
very
solemn
,
and
say
nothing
more
till
he
get
to
the
Bank
,
when
he
trot
off
as
fast
as
he
can
,
leave
us
to
do
the
same
,
and
to
wish
,
as
we
walk
away
,
that
we
could
impart
to
other
any
portion
of
the
amusement
we
have
gain
for

<EOS>
the

ever
have
the
honour

gratification
of
know
by
sight

and
our
acquaintance
in
this
way
have
be
most
extensive

there
be
one
who
make
an
impression
on
our

which
can
never

efface
,
and
who
awaken
in
our
bosom
a
feeling

admiration

which
we
entertain
a
fatal
presentiment
will
never

He

prepossess
appearance

He

a
brown

white

no

cabman
;
his
nose
be
generally
red
,
and
his
bright
blue
eye
not
unfrequently
stand
out
in
bold
relief
against
a
black
border
of
artificial
workmanship
;
his
boot
be
of
the
Wellington
form

pull
up

his
corduroy
knee
-
small
,
or
at

to
approach
as
near
them
as
their
dimension
would
admit
of
;
and
his
neck
be
usually
garnish
with
a
bright
yellow
handkerchief

<EOS>
in
summer
he
carry
in
his
mouth
a
flower
;
in
winter
,
a
straw
---
slight
,
but
,
to
a
contemplative
mind
,
certain
indication
of
a
love
of
nature
,
and
a
taste
for
botany

<EOS>
His
cabriolet
be
gorgeously
paint

a
bright
red

wherever
we
go

City

West

Paddington

North

East

there
be

bump
up

turn

out

among
hackney

coach

contrive
by
some
strange

other
,
to
get
out

place
which
no
other
vehicle
but
the
red
cab
could
ever
by
any
possibility
have
contrive
to
get
into
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Our
fondness
for
that
red
cab
be
unbounded
.
 
<EOS>
how
we
should
have
like
to
have
see
it
in
the
circle
at
Astley
's
!
 
<EOS>
Our
life
upon
it
,
that
it
should
have
perform
such
evolution
as
would
have
put
the
whole
company
to
shame
---
indian
chiefs
,
knight
,
swiss
peasant
,
and
all
.
   
<EOS>
some
people
object
to
the
exertion
of
get
into
cab
,
and
other
object
to
the
difficulty
of
get
out
of
them
;
we
think
both
these
be
objection
which
take
their
rise
in
perverse
and
ill
-
condition
mind
.
 
<EOS>
the
get
into
a
cab
be
a
very
pretty
and
graceful
process
,
which
,
when
well
perform
,
be
essentially
melodramatic
.
 
<EOS>
first
,
there
be
the
expressive
pantomime
of
every
one
of
the
eighteen
cabman
on
the
stand
,
the
moment
you
raise
your
eye
from
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
then
there
be
your
own
pantomime
in
reply
---
quite
a
little
ballet
.
 
<EOS>
four
cab
immediately
leave
the
stand
,
for
your
especial
accommodation
;
and
the
evolution
of
the
animal
who
draw
them
,
be
beautiful
in
the
extreme
,
as
they
grate
the
wheel
of
the
cab
against
the
curb
-
stone
,
and
sport
playfully
in
the
kennel
.
 
<EOS>
You
single
out
a
particular
cab
,
and
dart
swiftly
towards
it
.
 
<EOS>
one
bind
,
and
you
be
on
the
first
step
;
turn
your
body
lightly
round
to
the
right
,
and
you
be
on
the
second
;
bend
gracefully
beneath
the
rein
,
work
round
to
the
left
at
the
same
time
,
and
you
be
in
the
cab
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
difficulty
in
find
a
seat
:
 
<EOS>
the
apron
knock
you
comfortably
into
it
at
once
,
and
off
you
go
.
   
<EOS>
the
get
out
of
a
cab
be
,
perhaps
,
rather
more
complicated
in
its
theory
,
and
a
shade
more
difficult
in
its
execution
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
study
the
subject
a
great
deal
,
and
we
think
the
good
way
be
,
to
throw
yourself
out
,
and
trust
to
chance
for
alight
on
your
foot
.
<EOS>
if
you
make
the
driver
alight
first
,
and
then
throw
yourself
upon
him
,
you
will
find
that
he
break
your
fall
materially
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
event
of
your
contemplate
an
offer
of
eightpence
,
on
no
account
make
the
tender
,
or
show
the
money
,
until
you
be
safely
on
the
pavement
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
bad
policy
attempt
to
save
the
fourpence
.
<EOS>
You
be
very
much
in
the
power
of
a
cabman
,
and
he
consider
it
a
kind
of
fee
not
to
do
you
any
wilful
damage
.
 
<EOS>
any
instruction
,
however
,
in
the
art
of
get
out
of
a
cab
,
be
wholly
unnecessary
if
you
be
go
any
distance
,
because
the
probability
be
,
that
you
will
be
shoot
lightly
out
before
you
have
complete
the
third
mile
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
not
aware
of
any
instance
on
record
in
which
a
cab
-
horse
have
perform
three
consecutive
mile
without
go
down
once
.
 
<EOS>
what
of
that
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
all
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
these
day
of
derangement
of
the
nervous
system
and
universal
lassitude
,
people
be
content
to
pay
handsomely
for
excitement
;
where
can
it
be
procure
at
a
cheap
rate
?
   
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
the
red
cab
;
it
be
omnipresent
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
but
to
walk
down
Holborn
,
or
Fleet
-
street
,
or
any
of
the
principal
thoroughfare
in
which
there
be
a
great
deal
of
traffic
,
and
judge
for
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
hardly
turn
into
the
street
,
when
you
see
a
trunk
or
two
,
lie
on
the
ground
:
 
an
uprooted
post
,
a
hat
-
box
,
a
portmanteau
,
and
a
carpet
-
bag
,
strew
about
in
a
very
picturesque
manner
:
 
a
horse
in
a
cab
stand
by
,
look
about
him
with
great
unconcern
;
and
a
crowd
,
shout
and
scream
with
delight

cool
their
flush
face
against
the
glass
window
of
a
chemist

<EOS>
we

who
emerge
so
coolly
from

philosophically
climb
into

little
dickey

start
off
at
full
gallop
,
be

license
driver
?
   
<EOS>
the
ubiquity
of
this
red
cab
,
and
the
influence
it
exercise
over
the
risible
muscle
of
justice
itself
,
be
perfectly
astonishing
.
<EOS>
You
walk
into
the
justice

room
of
the
Mansion

house
;
the
whole
court
resound
with
merriment

the
Lord
Mayor
throw
himself
back
in
his
chair
,
in
a
state
of
frantic
delight
at
his
own
joke
;
every
vein
in
Mr
Hobler
's
countenance
be
swell
with
laughter
,
partly
at
the
Lord
Mayor
's
facetiousness
,
but
more
at
his
own
;
the
constable
and
police

officer
be
(
as
in
duty
bind
)
in
ecstasy
at
Mr
Hobler
and
the
Lord

combine
;
and
the
very
pauper
,
glance
respectfully
at
the
beadle
's
countenance
,
try
to
smile

as
even
he
relax
.
 
<EOS>
a
tall
,
weazen
-
faced
man
,
with
an
impediment
in
his
speech
,
would
be
endeavour
to
state
a
case
of
imposition
against
the
red
cab
's
driver
;
and
the
red
cab
's
driver
,
and
the
Lord
Mayor
,
and
Mr
Hobler
,
would
be
have
a
little
fun
among
themselves
,
to
the
inordinate
delight
of
everybody
but
the
complainant
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
end
,
justice
would
be
so
tickle
with
the
red
cab
-
driver
's
native
humour
,
that
the
fine
would
be
mitigate
,
and
he
would
go
away
full
gallop
,
in
the
red
cab
,
to
impose
on
somebody
else
without
loss
of
time
.
   
<EOS>
the
driver
of
the
red
cab
,
confident
in
the
strength
of
his
own
moral
principle
,
like
many
other
philosopher
,
be
will
not
to
set
the
feeling
and
opinion
of
society
at
complete
defiance
.
 
<EOS>
generally
speak
,
perhaps
,
he
would
as
soon
carry
a
fare
safely
to
his
destination
,
as
he
would
upset
him
---
sooner
,
perhaps
,
because
in
that
case
he
not
only
get
the
money
,
but
have
the
additional
amusement
of
run
a
long
heat
against
some
smart
rival
.
 
<EOS>
but
society
make
war
upon
him
in
the
shape
of
penalty
,
and
he
must
make
war
upon
society
in
his
own
way
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
reasoning
of
the
red
cab
-
driver
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
he
bestow
a
searching
look
upon
the
fare
,
as
he
put
his
hand
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
when
he
have
go
half
the
mile
,
to
get
the
money
ready
;
and
if
he
bring
forth
eightpence
,
out
he
go
.
   
<EOS>
the
last
time
we
see
our

be
one
wet
evening
in
Tottenham

court

road
,
when
he
be
engage
in
a
very
warm
and
somewhat
personal
altercation
with
a
loquacious
little
gentleman
in
a
green
coat
.
 
<EOS>
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
there
be
great
excuse
to
be
make
for
him
:
he
have
not
receive
above
eighteenpence
more
than
his
fare
,
and
consequently
labour
under
a
great
deal
of
very
natural
indignation
.
 
<EOS>
the
dispute
have
attain
a
pretty
considerable
height
,
when
at
last
the
loquacious
little
gentleman
,
make
a
mental
calculation
of
the
distance
,
and
find
that
he
have
already
pay
more
than
he
ought
,
avow
his
unalterable
determination
to
"
pull
up
"
the
cabman
in
the
morning
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
just
mark
this

I

up

<EOS>
"
no

will
you

"
say
our

with
a
sneer

<EOS>
"
I

reply
the

"
mark
my

<EOS>
if
I
live
till

you
shall
repent
this

"
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
steadiness
of
purpose
,
and
indignation
of
speech
,
about
the
little
gentleman
,
as
he
take
an
angry
pinch
of
snuff
,
after
this
last
declaration
,
which
make
a
visible
impression
on
the
mind
of
the
red
cab

driver

<EOS>
He
appear
to
hesitate
for

<EOS>
It
be
only
for
an

You

<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
rejoin
the
little
gentleman
,
with
even
great
vehemence
an
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
very
well
,
"
say
our
friend
,
tuck
up
his
shirt
sleeve
very
calmly
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
will
be
three
veek
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
wery
good
;
that
will
bring
me
up
to
the
middle
o
'
next
month
.
 
<EOS>
three
veek
more
would
carry
me
on
to
my
birthday
,
and
then
I
have
get
ten
pound
to
draw
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
as
well
get
board
,
lodgin
'
,
and
washin
'
,
till
then
,
out
of
the
county
,
as
pay
for
it
myself
;
consequently
here
go
!
"
   
<EOS>
so
,
without
more
ado
,
the
red
cab
-
driver
knock
the
little
gentleman
down
,
and
then
call
the
police
to
take
himself
into
custody
,
with
all
the
civility
in
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
a
story
be
nothing
without
the
sequel
;
and
therefore
,
we
may
state
,
that
to
our
certain
knowledge
,
the
board
,
lodging
,
and
washing
be
all
provide
in
due
course
.
 
<EOS>
We
happen
to
know
the
fact
,
for
it
come
to
our
knowledge
thus
:
 
<EOS>
We
go
over
the
House
of
Correction
for
the
county
of
Middlesex
shortly
after
,
to
witness
the
operation
of
the
silent
system
;
and
look
on
all
the
"
wheel
"
with
the
great
anxiety
,
in
search
of
our
long
-
lose
friend
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
nowhere
to
be
see
,
however
,
and
we
begin
to
think
that
the
little
gentleman
in
the
green
coat
must
have
relent
,
when
,
as
we
be
traverse
the
kitchen
-
garden
,
which
lie
in
a
sequestered
part
of
the
prison
,
we
be
startle
by
hear
a
voice
,
which
apparently
proceed
from
the
wall
,
pour
forth
its
soul
in
the
plaintive
air
of
"
all
round
my
hat
,
"
which
be
then
just
begin
to
form
a
recognise
portion
of
our
national
music
.
   
<EOS>
We
start
.
<EOS>
---
"
what
voice
be
that
?
"
say
we
.
 
<EOS>
the
Governor
shake
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
sad
fellow
,
"
he
reply
,
"
very
sad
.
 
<EOS>
He
positively
refuse
to
work
on
the
wheel
;
so
,
after
many
trial
,
I
be
compel
to
order
him
into
solitary
confinement
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
he
like
it
very
much
though
,
and
I
be
afraid
he
do
,
for
he
lie
on
his
back
on
the
floor
,
and
sings
comic
song
all
day
!
"
   
<EOS>
Shall
we
add
,
that
our
heart
have
not
deceive
us
and
that
the
comic
singer
be
no
other
than
our
eagerly
-
seek
friend
,
the
red
cab
-
driver
?
   
<EOS>
We
have
never
see
him
since
,
but
we
have
strong
reason
to
suspect
that
this
noble
individual
be
a
distant
relative
of
a
waterman
of
our
acquaintance
,
who
,
on
one
occasion
,
when
we
be
pass
the
coach
-
stand
over
which
he
preside
,
after
stand
very
quietly
to
see
a
tall
man
struggle
into
a
cab
,
run
up
very
briskly
when
it
be
all
over
(
as
his
brother
invariably
do
)
,
and
,
touch
his
hat
,
ask
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
for
"
a
copper
for
the
waterman
.
<EOS>
"
now
,
the
fare
be
by
no
mean
a
handsome
man
;
and
,
wax
very
indignant
at
the
demand
,
he
reply
---
"
money
!
 
<EOS>
what
for
?
 
<EOS>
come
up
and
look
at
me
,
I
suppose
!
<EOS>
"
---
"
Vell
,
sir
,
"
rejoin
the
waterman
,
with
a
smile
of
immovable
complacency
,
"
that
be
worth
twopence
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
identical
waterman
afterwards
attain
a
very
prominent
station
in
society
;
and
as
we
know
something
of
his
life
,
and
have
often
think
of
tell
what
we
do
know
,
perhaps
we
shall
never
have
a
well
opportunity
than
the
present
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
William
Barker
,
then
,
for
that
be
the
gentleman
's
name
<EOS>
,
Mr
William
Barker
be
bear
---
but
why
need
we
relate
where
Mr
William
Barker
be
bear
,
or
when
?
 
<EOS>
why
scrutinise
the
entry
in
parochial
ledger
,
or
seek
to
penetrate
the
lucinian
mystery
of
lying

in
hospital
?
 
<EOS>
Mr
William
Barker
WAS
bear
,
or
he
have
never

<EOS>
there
be
a
son
---
there
be
a
father

<EOS>
there
be
an
effect
---
there
be
a
cause
.
 
<EOS>
surely
this
be
sufficient
information
for
the
most
Fatima

like
curiosity
;
and
,
if
it
be
not
,
we
regret
our
inability
to
supply
any
further
evidence
on
the
point
.
 
<EOS>
Can
there
be
a
more
satisfactory
,
or
more
strictly
parliamentary
course
?
 
<EOS>
impossible
.
   
<EOS>
We
at
once
avow
a
similar
inability
to
record
at
what
precise
period
,
or
by
what
particular
process
<EOS>
,
this
gentleman
's
patronymic

of
William
Barker

become
corrupt
into
"
Bill
Boorker

"
<EOS>
Mr
Barker
acquire
a
high
standing
,
and
no
inconsiderable
reputation
,
among
the
member
of
that
profession
to
which
he
more
peculiarly
devote
his
energy
;
and
to
them
he
be
generally
know
,
either
by
the
familiar
appellation
of
"
Bill
Boorker
,
"
or
the
flattering
designation
of
"
Aggerawatin
'
Bill
,
"
the
latter
be
a
playful
and
expressive
SOBRIQUET
,
illustrative
of
Mr

's
great
talent
in
"

"
and
render
wild
such
subject
of
her
Majesty
as
be
convey
from
place
to
place
,
through
the
instrumentality
of
omnibus
.
 
<EOS>
of
the
early
life
of
Mr
Barker
little
be
know
,
and
even
that
little
be
involve
in
considerable
doubt
and
obscurity
.
<EOS>
a
want
of
application
,
a
restlessness
of
purpose
,
a
thirsting
after
porter
,
a
love
of
all
that
be
rove
and
cadger
-
like
in
nature
,
share
in
common
with
many
other
great
genius
,
appear
to
have
be
his
lead
characteristic
.
 
<EOS>
the
busy
hum
of
a
parochial
free
-
school
,
and
the
shady
repose
of
a
county
gaol
,
be
alike
inefficacious
in
produce
the
slight
alteration
in
Mr
Barker
's
disposition
.
 
<EOS>
His
feverish
attachment
to
change
and
variety
nothing
could
repress
;
his
native
dare
no
punishment
could
subdue
.
   
<EOS>
if
Mr
Barker
can
be
fairly
say
to
have
have
any
weakness
in
his
early
year
,
it
be
an
amiable
one
---
love
;
love
in
its
most
comprehensive
form
---
a
love
of
lady
,
liquid
,
and
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
selfish
feeling
;
it
be
not
confine
to
his
own
possession
,
which
but
too
many
man
regard
with
exclusive
complacency
.
 
<EOS>
no
;
it
be
a
noble
love
---
a
general
principle
.
 
<EOS>
It
extend
itself
with
equal
force
to
the
property
of
other
people
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
something
very
affect
in
this
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
still
more
affecting
to
know
,
that
such
philanthropy
be
but
imperfectly
reward
.

be
a
poor
return
for
general
benevolence
,
evince
itself
in
an
irrepressible
love
for
all
create
object
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Barker
feel
it
so
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
lengthened
interview
with
the
high
legal
authority
,
he
quit
his
ungrateful
country
,
with
the
consent
,
and
at
the
expense
,
of
its
Government
;
proceed
to
a
distant
shore
;
and
there
employ
himself
,
like
another
Cincinnatus
,
in
clear
and
cultivate
the
soil
---
a
peaceful
pursuit
,
in
which
a
term
of
seven
year
glide
almost
imperceptibly
away
.
   
<EOS>
whether
,
at
the
expiration
of
the
period
we
have
just
mention
,
the
british
Government
require
Mr
Barker
's
presence
here
,
or
do
not
require
his
residence
abroad
,
we
have
no
distinct
mean
of
ascertaining
.
 
<EOS>
We
should
be
incline
,
however
,
to
favour
the
latter
position
,
inasmuch
as
we
do
not
find
that
he
be
advanced
to
any
other
public
post
on
his
return
,
than
the
post
at
the
corner
of
the
Haymarket
,
where
he
officiate
as
assistant
-
waterman
to
the
hackney
-
coach
stand
.
 
<EOS>
Seated
,
in
this
capacity
,
on
a
couple
of
tub
near
the
curbstone
,
with
a
brass
plate
and
number
suspend
round
his
neck
by
a
massive
chain
,
and
his
ankle
curiously
envelop
in
hayband
,
he
be
suppose
to
have
make
those
observation
on
human
nature
which
exercise
so
material
an
influence
over
all
his
proceeding
in
later
life
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Barker
have
not
officiate
for
many
month
in
this
capacity
,
when
the
appearance
of
the
first
omnibus
cause
the
public
mind
to
go
in
a
new
direction
,
and
prevent
a
great
many
hackney
-
coach
from
go
in
any
direction
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
the
genius
of
Mr
Barker
at
once
perceive
the
whole
extent
of
the
injury
that
would
be
eventually
inflict
on
cab
and
coach
stand
,
and
,
by
consequence
,
on
waterman
also
,
by
the
progress
of
the
system
of
which
the
first
omnibus
be
a
part
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
,
too
,
the
necessity
of
adopt
some
more
profitable
profession
;
and
his
active
mind
at
once
perceive
how
much
may
be
do
in
the
way
of
entice
the
youthful
and
unwary
,
and
shove
the
old
and
helpless
,
into
the
wrong
buss
,
and
carry
them
off
,
until
,
reduce
to
despair
,
they
ransom
themselves
by
the
payment
of
sixpence
a
-
head
,
or
,
to
adopt
his
own
figurative
expression
in
all
its
native
beauty
,
"
till
they
be
rig'larly
do
over
,
and
fork
out
the
stumpy
.
"
   
<EOS>
an
opportunity
for
realise
his
fond
anticipation
,
soon
present
itself
.
 
<EOS>
Rumours
be
rife
on
the
hackney
-
coach
stand
,
that
a
buss
be
build
,
to
run
from
Lisson
-
grove
to
the
Bank
,
down
Oxford
-
street
and
Holborn
;
and
the
rapid
increase
of
bus
on
the
Paddington
-
road
,
encourage
the
idea
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Barker
secretly
and
cautiously
inquire
in
the
proper
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
the
report
be
correct
;
the
"
Royal
William
"
be
to
make
its
first
journey
on
the
follow
Monday
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
crack
affair
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
an
enterprising
young
cabman
,
of
establish
reputation
as
a
dashing
whip
---
for
he
have
compromise
with
the
parent
of
three
scrunch
child
,
and
just
"
work
out
"
his
fine
for
knock
down
an
old
lady
---
be
the
driver
;
and
the
spirited
proprietor
,
know
Mr
Barker
's
qualification
,
appoint
him
to
the
vacant
office
of
cad
on
the
very
first
application
.
 
<EOS>
the
buss
begin
to
run
,
and
Mr
Barker
enter
into
a
new
suit
of
clothe
,
and
on
a
new
sphere
of
action
.
   
<EOS>
to
recapitulate
all
the
improvement
introduce
by
this
extraordinary
man
into
the
omnibus
system
---
gradually
,
indeed
,
but
surely
---
would
occupy
a
far
great
space
than
we
be
enable
to
devote
to
this
imperfect
memoir
.
 
<EOS>
to
him
be
universally
assign
the
original
suggestion
of
the
practice
which
afterwards
become
so
general
---
of
the
driver
of
a
second
buss
keep
constantly
behind
the
first
one
,
and
drive
the
pole
of
his
vehicle
either
into
the
door
of
the
other
,
every
time
it
be
open
,
or
through
the
body
of
any
lady
or
gentleman
who
may
make
an
attempt
to
get
into
it
;
a
humorous
and
pleasant
invention
,
exhibit
all
that
originality
of
idea
,
and
fine
,
bold
flow
of
spirit
,
so
conspicuous
in
every
action
of
this
great
man
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Barker
have
opponent
of
course
;
what
man
in
public
life
have
not
?
 
<EOS>
but
even
his
bad
enemy
can
not
deny
that
he
have
take
more
old
lady
and
gentleman
to
Paddington
who
want
to
go
to
the
Bank
,
and
more
old
lady
and
gentleman
to
the
Bank
who
want
to
go
to
Paddington
,
than
any
six
man
on
the
road
;
and
however
much
malevolent
spirit
may
pretend
to
doubt
the
accuracy
of
the
statement
<EOS>
,
they
well
know
it
to
be
an
establish
fact
,
that
he
have
forcibly
convey
a
variety
of
ancient
person
of
either
sex
,
to
both
place
,
who
have
not
the
slight
or
most
distant
intention
of
go
anywhere
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Barker
be
the
identical
cad
who
nobly
distinguish
himself
,
some
time
since
,
by
keep
a
tradesman
on
the
step
---
the
omnibus
go
at
full
speed
all
the
time
---
till
he
have
thrash
him
to
his
entire
satisfaction
,
and
finally
throw
him
away
,
when
he
have
quite
do
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Barker
<EOS>
it
OUGHT
to
have
be
,
who
honestly
indignant
at
be
ignominiously
eject
from
a
house
of
public
entertainment
,
kick
the
landlord
in
the
knee
,
and
thereby
cause
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
We
say
it
OUGHT
to
have
be
Mr
Barker
,
because
the
action
be
not
a
common
one
,
and
could
have
emanate
from
no
ordinary
mind
.
   
<EOS>
It
have
now
become
matter
of
history
;
it
be
record
in
the
Newgate
Calendar
;
and
we
wish
we
could
attribute
this
piece
of
dare
heroism
to
Mr
Barker
.
 
<EOS>
We
regret
be
compel
to
state
that
it
be
not
perform
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
Would
,
for
the
family
credit
we
could
add
,
that
it
be
achieve
by
his
brother
!
   
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
exercise
of
the
nice
detail
of
his
profession
,
that
Mr
Barker
's
knowledge
of
human
nature
be
beautifully
display
.
<EOS>
He
could
tell
at
a
glance
where
a
passenger
want
to
go
to
,
and
would
shout
the
name
of
the
place
accordingly
,
without
the
slight
reference
to
the
real
destination
of
the
vehicle
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
exactly
the
kind
of
old
lady
that
would
be
too
much
flurry
by
the
process
of
push
in
and
pull
out
of
the
caravan
,
to
discover
where
she
have
be
put
down
,
until
too
late
;
have
an
intuitive
perception
of
what
be
pass
in
a
passenger
's
mind
when
he
inwardly
resolve
to
"
pull
that
cad
up
to
-
morrow
morning
;
"
and
never
fail
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
female
servant
,
whom
he
would
place
next
the
door
,
and
talk
to
all
the
way
.
   
<EOS>
human
judgment
be
never
infallible
,
and
it
would
occasionally
happen
that
Mr
Barker
experimentalise
with
the
timidity
or
forbearance
of
the
wrong
person
,
in
which
case
a
summon
to
a
police
-
office
,
be
,
on
more
than
one
occasion
,
follow
by
a
committal
to
prison
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
the
power
of
trifle
such
as
these
,

We

of
Mr

of

in
the
past

<EOS>
alas

<EOS>
Mr

fast
disappearing
.
<EOS>
improvement
have
peer
beneath
the
apron
of
our
cab
,
and
penetrate
to
the
very
innermost
recess
of
our
omnibus

<EOS>
Dirt
and
fustian
will
vanish
before
cleanliness
and
livery

<EOS>
Slang

be
forget
when

and
that
enlighten

profound

deprive

We

our

ominous

<EOS>
We
assure
them
that
we
be
not
about

political

we
the

It

occur

the
House

and
the
crowd
that
resort
to
it
on
the
night
of
an
important
debate

would
be
productive
of
some
amusement

as
we

make
some
few
call
at
the
aforesaid
house
in
our
time

have
visit
it
quite
often
enough
for

comfort
<EOS>

we
have
determine
to
attempt
the
description

<EOS>
dismiss
from

all
that
feeling
of

which
vague
idea

Serjeant

at

heavy
denunciation
,
and
still
heavy
fee

upon
our
subject

You

ferocious

look
gentleman

with
a
complexion
almost
as
sallow
as

and
which

the

now
nearly
extinct

He

have
be
from

<EOS>
whereof
the
memory

<EOS>
look
at
his
loose

wide

brown

with
capacious
pocket
on

the

with
straggle

stick
out
beyond

<EOS>
It

a

He
can
tell

<EOS>
He
have
a
great
contempt
for
all

think
it
quite
impossible
that
a

can
say
anything
worth
hearing
,
unless
he
have
sit
in
the
House
for
fifteen
year
at
least
,
without

anything
at
all

<EOS>
He
be
of
opinion
that
"
that
young
Macaulay

be
a
regular
impostor
;
he
allow
,
that
Lord

may
do
something
one

He

could
be
knock
up

to

a
great
many
other
anecdote
of
a
similar

<EOS>
there
he
stand

lean
on
his

;
look
at
the
throng
of
Exquisites
around
him
with
most
profound
contempt

flourish
more
brightly

He

with

It

when

the

good

take

they

through

as

a
little
use
to
the
mist
of
the
place

and
the
glare
of
the
chandelier
below
you

you
will
see
that
some
unimportant
personage
on
the
ministerial
side
of
the
House
(
to
your
right

)
be
speak
,
amidst
a
hum
of
voice
and
confusion
which
would
rival
Babel

for
the
circumstance

its
be
all
in

the
"

take
one

<EOS>
the
body
of
the

the

be
full
of

some

with
their

<EOS>
but
let
us
not
omit
to
notice
Bellamy

kitchen
,
or
,
in
other
word
,
the
refreshment

room
,
common
to
both
Houses
of
Parliament

where
Ministerialists

Oppositionists

Whigs

Tories
,
Radicals

Peers

stranger
from

the
more
favoured

alike
at

to

;
where
diver
honourable

prove
their
perfect
independence
by
remain
during
the
whole
of
a
heavy
debate
,
solace
themselves
with
the

;
and
whence
they
be
summon
by
whipper
-
in
,
when
the
House
be
on
the
point
of
divide
;
either
to
give
their
"
conscientious
vote
"
on
question
of
which
they
be
conscientiously
innocent
of
know
anything
<EOS>
whatever
,
or
to
find
a
vent
for
the
playful
exuberance
of
their
wine
-
inspire

,
in
boisterous
shout
of
"
Divide
,
"
occasionally
varied
with
a
little
howling
,
barking
,
crowing
,
or
other
ebullition
of
senatorial
pleasantry
.
   
<EOS>
when
you
have
ascend
the
narrow
staircase
which
,
in
the
present
temporary
House
of
Commons
,
lead
to
the
place
we
be
describe
,
you
will
probably
observe
a
couple
of
room
on
your
right
hand
,
with
table
spread
for
dining
.
 
<EOS>
neither
of
these
be
the
kitchen
,
although
they
be
both
devoted
to
the

purpose
;
the
kitchen
be
further
on
to
our
left
,
up
these
half
-
dozen
stair
.
 
<EOS>
before
we
ascend
the
staircase
,
however
,
we
must
request
you
to
pause
in
front
of
this
little
bar
-
place
with
the
sash

window
;
and
beg
your
particular
attention
to
the
steady
,
honest

look
old
fellow
in
black
,
who
be
its
sole
occupant
.
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
<EOS>
(
we
do
not
mind
mention
the
old
fellow
's
name
,
for
if
Nicholas
be
not
a
public
man
,
who
be
?
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
public

be
public

---
Nicholas
be
the
butler
of
Bellamy
's
,
and
have
hold
the
same
place
,
dress
exactly
in
the
same
manner
,
and
say
precisely
the
same
thing
,
ever
since
the
old
of
its
present
visitor
can
remember
.
<EOS>
an
excellent
servant
Nicholas
be
---
an
unrivalled
compounder
of
salad
-
dressing
---
an
admirable
preparer
of
soda
-
water
and
lemon
---
a
special
mixer
of
cold
grog
and
punch
---
and
,
above
all
,
an
unequalled
judge
of
cheese
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
old
man
have
such
a
thing
as
vanity
in
his
composition
,
this
be
certainly
his
pride
;
and
if
it
be
possible
to
imagine
that
anything
in
this
world
could
disturb
his
impenetrable
calmness
,
we
should
say
it
would
be
the
doubt
his
judgment
on
this
important
point
.
   
<EOS>
We
need
not
tell
you
all
this
,
however
,
for
if
you
have
an
atom
of
observation
,
one
glance
at
his
sleek
,
know
-
look
head
and
face
---
his
prim
white
neckerchief
,
with
the
wooden
tie
into
which
it
have
be
regularly
fold
for
twenty
year
past
,
merge
by
imperceptible
degree
into
a
small
-
plaited
shirt
-
frill
---
and
his
comfortable
-
look
form
encase
in
a
well
-
brush
suit
of
black
---
would
give
you
a
well
idea
of
his
real
character
than
a
column
of
our
poor
description
could
convey
.
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
be
rather
out
of
his
element
now
;
he
can
not
see
the
kitchen
as
he
use
to
in
the
old
House
;
there
,
one
window
of
his
glass
-
case
open
into
the
room
,
and
then
,
for
the
edification
and
behoof
of
more
juvenile
questioner
,
he
would
stand
for
an
hour
together
,
answer
deferential
question
about
Sheridan
,
and
Percival
,
and
Castlereagh
,
and
Heaven
know
who
beside
,
with
manifest
delight
,
always
insert
a
"
Mister
"
before
every
commoner
's
name
.
   
<EOS>
Nicholas
,
like
all
man
of
his
age
and
standing
,
have
a
great
idea
of
the
degeneracy
of
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
seldom
express
any
political
opinion
,
but
we
manage
to
ascertain
,
just
before
the
passing
of
the
Reform
Bill
,
that
Nicholas
be
a
thorough
Reformer
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
our
astonishment
to
discover
shortly
after
the
meeting
of
the
first
reform
Parliament
,
that
he
be
a
most
inveterate
and
decide
Tory
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
odd
:
 
<EOS>
some
man
change
their
opinion
from
necessity
,
other
from
expediency
,
other
from
inspiration
;
but
that
Nicholas
should
undergo
any
change
in
any
respect
,
<EOS>
be
an
event
we
have
never
contemplate
,
and
should
have
consider
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
His
strong
opinion
against
the
clause
which
empower
the
metropolitan
district
to
return
member
to
Parliament
,
too
,
be
perfectly
unaccountable
.
   
<EOS>
We
discover
the
secret
at
last
;
the
metropolitan
Members
always
dine
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
the
rascal
!
 
<EOS>
as
for
give
additional
member
to
Ireland
,
it
be
even
bad
---
decidedly
unconstitutional
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
sir
,
an
Irish
Member
would
go
up
there
,
and
eat
more
dinner
than
three
English
Members
put
together
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
no
wine
;
drank
table
-
beer
by
the
half
-
gallon
;
and
go
home
to
Manchester
-
building
,
or
Millbank
-
street
,
for
his
whiskey
-
and
-
water
.
 
<EOS>
and
what
be
the
consequence
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
the
concern
lose
---
actually
lose
,
sir
---
by
his
patronage
.
 
<EOS>
a
queer
old
fellow
be
Nicholas
,
and
as
completely
a
part
of
the
building
as
the
house
itself
.
 
<EOS>
We
wonder
he
ever
leave
the
old
place
,
and
fully
expect
to
see
in
the
paper
,
the
morning
after
the
fire
,
a
pathetic
account
of
an
old
gentleman
in
black
,
of
decent
appearance
,
who
be
see
at
one
of
the
upper
window
when
the
flame
be
at
their
height
,
and
declare
his
resolute
intention
of
fall
with
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
have
be
get
out
by
force
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
be
get
out
---
<EOS>
here
he
be
again
,
look
as
he
always
do
,
as
if
he
have
be
in
a
bandbox
ever
since
the
last
session
.
 
<EOS>
there
he
be
,
at
his
old
post
every
night
,
just
as
we
have
describe
him
:
 
and
,
as
character
be
scarce
,
and
faithful
servant
scarcer
,
long
may
he
be
there
,
say
we
!
   
<EOS>
now
,
when
you
have
take
your
seat
in
the
kitchen
,
and
duly
notice
the
large
fire
and
roast
-
jack
at
one
end
of
the
room
---
the
little
table
for
wash
glass
and
drain
jug
at
the
other
---
the
clock
over
the
window
opposite
St
Margaret
's
Church
---
the
deal
table
and
wax
candle
---
the
damask
table
-
cloth
and
bare
floor
---
the
plate
and
china
on
the
table
,
and
the
gridiron
on
the
fire
;
and
a
few
other
anomaly
peculiar
to
the
place
---
we
will
point
out
to
your
notice
two
or
three
of
the
people
present
,
whose
station
or
absurdity
render
them
the
most
worthy
of
remark
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
half
-
past
twelve
o'clock
,
and
as
the
division
be
not
expect
for
an
hour
or
two
,
a
few
member
be
lounge
away
the
time
here
in
preference
to
stand
at
the
bar
of
the
House
,
or
sleep
in
one
of
the
side

<EOS>
that
singularly
awkward
and
ungainly

looking
man

in
the
brownish

white
hat
,
with
the
straggle
black
trouser
which
reach
about
half

way
down
the
leg

lean
against
the
meat

screen
,
apparently
delude
himself
into
the
belief
that
he

about
something
,
be
a
splendid
sample
of
a
Member
of
the
House
of
Commons
concentrate
in
his
own
person
the
wisdom
of
a
constituency
.
 
<EOS>
observe
the
wig
,
of
a
dark
hue
but
indescribable
colour
,
for
if
it
be
naturally
brown
,
it
have
acquire
a
black
tint
by
long
service
,
and
if
it
be
naturally
black
,
the
same
cause
have
impart
to
it
a
tinge
of
rusty
brown
;
and
remark
how
very
materially
the
great
blinker
-
like
spectacle
assist
the
expression
of
that
most
intelligent
face
.
 
<EOS>
seriously
speak
,
do
you
ever
see
a
countenance
so
expressive
of
the
most
hopeless
extreme
of
heavy
dulness
,
or
behold
a
form
so
strangely
put
together
?
 
<EOS>
He
be
no
great
speaker
:
 
but
when
he
do
address
the
House
,
the
effect
be
absolutely
irresistible
.
   
<EOS>
the
small
gentleman
with
the
sharp
nose
,
who
have
just
salute
him
,
be
a
Member
of
Parliament
,
an
ex
-
Alderman
,
and
a
sort
of
amateur
fireman
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
and
the
celebrated
fireman
's
dog
,
be
observe
to
be
remarkably
active
at
the
conflagration
of
the
two
Houses
of
Parliament
---
they
both
run
up
and
down
,
and
in
and
out
,
get
under
people
's
foot
,
and
into
everybody
's
way
,
fully
impressed
with
the
belief
that
they
be
do
a
great
deal
of
good
,
and
bark
tremendously
.
 
<EOS>
the
dog
go
quietly
back
to
his
kennel
with
the
engine
,
but
the
gentleman
keep
up
such
an
incessant
noise
for
some
week
after
the
occurrence
,
that
he
become
a
positive
nuisance
.
 
<EOS>
as
no
more
parliamentary
fire
have
occur
,
however
,
and
as
he
have
consequently
have
no
more
opportunity
of
write
to
the
newspaper
to
relate
how
,
by
way
of
preserve
picture
he
cut
them
out
of
their
frame
,
and
perform
other
great
national
service
,
he
have
gradually
relapse
into
his
old
state
of
calmness
.
   
<EOS>
that
female
in
black
---
not
the
one
whom
the
Lord's

Bill
Baronet
have
just
chuck
under
the
chin
;
the
short
of

be
"
Jane

"
the
Hebe
of
Bellamy
's
.
 
<EOS>
Jane
be
as
great
a
character
as
Nicholas
,
in
her
way
.
 
<EOS>
Her
leading
feature
be
a
thorough
contempt
for
the
great
majority
of
her
visitor
;
her
predominant
quality
,
love
of
admiration
,
as
you
can
not
fail
to
observe
,
if
you
mark
the
glee
with
which
she
listen
to
something
the
young
Member
near
her
mutter
somewhat
unintelligibly
in
her
ear
(
for
his
speech
be
rather
thick
from
some
cause
or
other
)
,
and
how
playfully
she
dig
the
handle
of
a
fork
into
the
arm
with
which
he
detain
her
,
by
way
of
reply
.
   
<EOS>
Jane
be
no
bad
hand
at
repartee
,
and
shower
them
about
,
with
a
degree
of
liberality
and
total
absence
of
reserve
or
constraint
,
which
occasionally
excite
no
small
amazement
in
the
mind
of
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
She
cut
joke
with
Nicholas
,
too
,
but
look
up
to
him
with
a
great
deal
of
respect
---
the
immovable
stolidity
with
which
Nicholas
receive
the
aforesaid
joke
,
and
look
on
,
at
certain
pastoral
frisking
and
romping
(
Jane
's
only
recreation
,
and
they
be
very
innocent
too
)
which
occasionally
take
place
in
the
passage
,
be
not
the
least
amusing
part
of
his
character
.
   
<EOS>
the
two
person
who

in

corner
,
at

farther
end
of

the

hear

we
really

the
amusement

purchase

you
deposit
yourself
in
a

that
you
may

You

great
speculation

on

possibility

your
be

noble
Lord

be
announce

the
first
thing
that
strike
you

on

the

You
observe

You

<EOS>
the
first
of
May
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
merry
freshness
in
the
sound
,
call
to
our
mind
a
thousand
thought
of
all
that
be
pleasant
in
nature
and
beautiful
in
her
most
delightful
form
.
 
<EOS>
what
man
be
there
,
over
whose
mind
a
bright
spring
morning
do
not
exercise
a
magic
influence
---
carry
him
back
to
the
day
of
his
childish
sport
,
and
conjure
up
before
him
the
old
green
field
with
its
gently
-
wave
tree
,
where
the
bird
sing
as
he
have
never
hear
them
since
---
where
the
butterfly
flutter
far
more
gaily
than
he
ever
see
him
now
,
in
all
his
rambling
---
where
the
sky
seem
bluer
,
and
the
sun
shine
more
brightly
---
where
the
air
blow
more
freshly
over
greener
grass
,
and
sweeter
-
smell
flower
---
where
everything
wear
a
rich
and
more
brilliant
hue
than
it
be
ever
dress
in
now
!
<EOS>
such
be
the
deep
feeling
of
childhood
,
and
such
be
the
impression
which
every
lovely
object
stamp
upon
its
heart
!
 
<EOS>
the
hardy
traveller
wander
through
the
maze
of
thick
and
pathless
wood
,
where
the
sun
's
ray
never
shine
,
and
heaven
's
pure
air
never
play
;
he
stand
on
the
brink
of
the
roar
waterfall
,
and
,
giddy
and
bewilder
,
watch
the
foam
mass
as
it
leap
from
stone
to
stone
,
and
from
crag
to
crag
;
he
linger
in
the
fertile
plain
of
a
land
of
perpetual
sunshine
,
and
revel
in
the
luxury
of
their
balmy
breath
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
be
the
deep
forest
,
or
the
thundering
water
,
or
the
rich
landscape
that
bounteous
nature
ever
spread
,
to
charm
the
eye
,
and
captivate
the
sense
of
man
,
compare
with
the
recollection
of
the
old
scene
of
his
early
youth
?
 
<EOS>
magic
scene
indeed
;
for
the
fancy
of
childhood
dress
them
in
colour
bright
than
the
rainbow
,
and
almost
as
fleeting
!
   
<EOS>
in
former
time
,
spring
bring
with
it
not
only
such
association
as
these
,
connect
with
the
past
,

sport
and
game
for
the
present
<EOS>
---
merry
dance

pillar
,
adorn
with
emblem

,
and
rear
in

its
coming

<EOS>
pillar
we
have
,
but
they
be
no
longer
rustic
one
;
and
as
to
dancer
,
they
be
use
to
room
,
and
light
,
and
would
not
show
well
in
the
open
air
.
 
<EOS>
think
of
the
immorality
,
too
!
 
<EOS>
what
would
your
sabbath
enthusiast
say
,
to
an
aristocratic
ring
encircle
the
Duke
of

's
column
in
Carlton

<EOS>
well
;
many
year
ago
we
begin
to
be
a
steady
and
matter
-
of
-
fact
sort
of
people
,
and
dance
in
spring
be
beneath
our
dignity
,
we
give
it
up
,
and
in
course
of
time
it
descend
to
the
sweep
---
a
fall
certainly
,
because
,
though
sweep
be
very
good
fellow
in
their
way
,
and
moreover
very
useful
in
a
civilised
community
,
they
be
not
exactly
the
sort
of
people
to
give
the
tone
to
the
little
elegance
of
society
.
 
<EOS>
the
sweep
,
however
,
get
the
dancing
to
themselves
,
and
they
keep
it
up
,
and
hand
it
down
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
severe
blow
to
the
romance
of
spring
-
time
,
but
,
it
do
not
entirely
destroy
it
,
either
;
for
a
portion
of
it
descend
to
the
sweep
with
the
dancing
,
and
render
them
object
of
great
interest
.
 
<EOS>
a
mystery
hang
over
the
sweep
in
those
day
.
 
<EOS>
Legends
be
in
existence
of
wealthy
gentleman
who
have
lose
child
,
and
who
,
after
many
year
of
sorrow
and
suffering
,
have
find
them
in
the
character
of
sweep
.
 
<EOS>
story
be
relate
of
a
young
boy
who
,
have
be
steal
from
his
parent
in
his
infancy
,
and
devote
to
the
occupation
of
chimney
-
sweep
,
be
send
,
in
the
course
of
his
professional
career
,
to
sweep
the
chimney
of
his
mother
's
bedroom
;
and
how
,
be
hot
and
tired
when
he
come
out
of
the
chimney
,
he
get
into
the
bed
he
have
so
often
sleep
in
as
an
infant
,
and
be
discover
and
recognise
therein
by
his
mother
,
who
once
every
year
of
her
life
,
thereafter
,
request
the
pleasure
of
the
company
of
every
London
sweep
,
at
half
-
past
one
o'clock
,
to
roast
beef
,
plum
-
pudding
,
porter
,
and
sixpence
.
   
<EOS>
such
story
as
these
,
and
there
be
many
such
,
throw
an
air
of
mystery
round
the
sweep
,
and
produce
for
them
some
of
those
good
effect
which
animal
derive
from
the
doctrine
of
the
transmigration
of
soul
.
 
<EOS>
no
one
(
except
the
master
)
think
of
ill
-
treat
a
sweep
,
because
no
one
know
who
he
may
be
,
or
what
nobleman
's
or
gentleman
's
son
he
may
turn
out
.
 
<EOS>
chimney
-
sweeping
be
,
by
many
believer
in
the
marvellous
,
consider
as
a
sort
of
probationary
term
,
at
an
early
or
later
period
of
which
,
diver
young
nobleman
be
to
come
into
possession
of
their
rank
and
title
:
 
and
the
profession
be
hold
by
them
in
great
respect
accordingly
.
   
<EOS>
We
remember
,
in
our
young
day
,
a
little
sweep
about
our
own
age
,
with
curly
hair
and
white
tooth
,
whom
we
devoutly
and
sincerely
believe
to
be
the
lose
son
and
heir
of
some
illustrious
personage
---
an
impression
which
be
resolve
into
an
unchangeable
conviction
on
our
infant
mind
,
by
the
subject
of
our
speculation
inform
us
,
one
day
,
in
reply
to
our
question
,
propound
a
few
moment
before
his
ascent
to
the
summit
of
the
kitchen
chimney
,
"
that
he
believe
he
would
be
bear
in
the
vurki
,
but
he
would
never
know'd
his
father
.
"
 
<EOS>
We
feel
certain
,
from
that
time
forth
,
that
he
would
one
day
be
own
by
a
lord
:
 
and
we
never
hear
the
church
-
bell
ring
,
or
see
a
flag
hoist
in
the
neighbourhood
,
without
think
that
the
happy
event
have
at
last
occur
,
and
that
his
long
-
lose
parent
have
arrive
in
a
coach
and
six
,
to
take
him
home
to
Grosvenor
-
square
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
come
,
however
;
and
,
at
the
present
moment
,
the
young
gentleman
in
question
be
settle
down
as
a
master
sweep
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Battle
-
bridge
,
his
distinguish
characteristic
be
a
decide
antipathy
to
wash
himself
,
and
the
possession
of
a
pair
of
leg
very
inadequate
to
the
support
of
his
unwieldy
and
corpulent
body
.
   
<EOS>
the
romance
of
spring
have
go
out
before
our
time
,
we
be
fain
to
console
ourselves
as
we
best
could
with
the
uncertainty
that
envelop
the
birth
and
parentage
of
its
attendant
dancer
,
the
sweep
;
and
we
do
console
ourselves
with
it
,
for
many
year
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
even
this
wicked
source
of
comfort
receive
a
shock
from
which
it
have
never
recover
---
a
shock
which
have
be
in
reality
its
death
-
blow
.
 
<EOS>
We
could
not
disguise
from
ourselves
the
fact
that
whole
family
of
sweep
be
regularly
bear
of
sweep
,
in
the
rural
district
of
Somers
Town
and
Camden
Town
---
that
the
eld
son
succeed
to
the
father
's
business
,
that
the
other
branch
assist
him
therein
,
and
commence
on
their
own
account
;
that
their
child
again
,
be
educate
to
the
profession
;
and
that
about
their
identity
there
could
be
no
mistake
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
We
could
not
be
blind
,
we
say
,
to
this
melancholy
truth
,
but
we
could
not
bring
ourselves
to
admit
it
,
nevertheless
,
and
we
live
on
for
some
year
in
a
state
of
voluntary
ignorance
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
rouse
from
our
pleasant
slumber
by
certain
dark
insinuation
throw
out
by
a
friend
of
ours
,
to
the
effect
that
child
in
the
low
rank
of
life
be
begin
to
CHOOSE
chimney
-
sweeping
as
their
particular
walk
;
that
application
have
be
make
by
various
boy
to
the
constituted
authority
,
to
allow
them
to
pursue
the
object
of
their
ambition
with
the
full
concurrence
and
sanction
of
the
law
;
that
the
affair
,
in
short
,
be
become
one
of
mere
legal
contract
.
<EOS>
We
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
these
rumour
at
first
,
but
slowly
and
surely
they
steal
upon
us
.
 
<EOS>
month
after
month
,
week
after
week
,
nay
,
day
after
day
,
at
last
,
do
we
meet
with
account
of
similar
application
.
 
<EOS>
the
veil
be
remove
,
all
mystery
be
at
an
end
,
and
chimney
-
sweeping
have
become
a
favourite
and
choose
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
longer
any
occasion
to
steal
boy
;
for
boy
flock
in
crowd
to
bind
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
the
romance
of
the
trade
have
flee
,
and
the
chimney
-
sweeper
of
the
present
day
,
be
no
more
like
unto
him
of
thirty
year
ago
,
than
be
a
Fleet
-
street
pickpocket
to
a
spanish
brigand
,
or
Paul
Pry
to
Caleb
Williams
.
   
<EOS>
this
gradual
decay
and
disuse
of
the
practice
of
lead
noble
youth
into
captivity
,
and
compel
them
to
ascend
chimney
,
be
a
severe
blow
,
if
we
may
so
speak
,
to
the
romance
of
chimney
-
sweep
,
and
to
the
romance
of
spring
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
but
even
this
be
not
all
,
for
some
few
year
ago
the
dancing
on

day
begin
to
decline
;

<EOS>
from
this
day
,
we
date
the
total
fall
of
the
last
linger
remnant
of
May
-
day
dancing
,
among
the
ELITE
of
the
profession
:
 
and
from
this
period
we
commence
a
new
era
in
that
portion
of
our
spring
association
which
relate
to
the
first
of
May
   
<EOS>
We
be
aware
that
the
unthinking
part
of
the
population
will
meet
us
here
,
with
the
assertion
,
that
dance
on
May
-
day
still
continue
---
that
"
green
"
be
annually
see
to
roll
along
the
street
---
that
youth
in
the
garb
of
clown
,
precede
them
,
give
vent
to
the
ebullition
of
their
sportive
fancy
;
and
that
lord
and
lady
follow
in
their
wake
.
   
<EOS>
grant
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
ready
to
acknowledge
that
in
outward
show
,
these
procession
have
greatly
improve
:
 
<EOS>
we
do
not
deny
the
introduction
of
solo
on
the
drum
;
we
will
even
go
so
far
as
to
admit
an
occasional
fantasia
on
the
triangle
,
but
here
our
admission
end
.
<EOS>
We
positively
deny
that
the
sweep
have
art
or
part
in
these
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
We
distinctly
charge
the
dustman
with
throw
what
they
ought
to
clear
away
,
into
the
eye
of
the
public
.
 
<EOS>
We
accuse
scavenger
,
brickmaker
,
and
gentleman
who
devote
their
energy
to
the
costermongering
line
,
with
obtain
money
once
a

year
,
under
false
pretence
.
 
<EOS>
We
cling
with
peculiar
fondness
to
the
custom
of
day
go
by
,
and
have
shut
out
conviction
as
long
as
we
could
,
but
it
have
force
itself
upon
us
;
and
we
now
proclaim
to
a
delude
public
,
that
the
May
-
day
dancer
be
not
sweep
.
 
<EOS>
the
size
of
them
,
alone
,
be
sufficient
to
repudiate
the
idea
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
notorious
fact
that
the
widely
-
spread
taste
for
register
-
stove
have
materially
increase
the
demand
for
small
boy
;
whereas
the
man
,
who
,
under
a
fictitious
character
,
dance
about
the
street
on
the
first
of
May
nowadays
,
would
be
a
tight
fit
in
a
kitchen
flue
,
to
say
nothing
of
the
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
strong
presumptive
evidence
,
but
we
have
positive
proof
---
the
evidence
of
our
own
sense
.
 
<EOS>
and
here
be
our
testimony
.
   
<EOS>
upon
the
morning
of
the
second
of
the
merry
month
of
May
,
in
the
year
of
our
Lord
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
thirty
-
six
,
we
go
out
for
a
stroll
,
with
a
kind
of
forlorn
hope
of
see
something
or
other
which
may
induce
us
to
believe
that
it
be
really
spring
,
and
not
Christmas
.
 
<EOS>
after
wander
as
far
as
Copenhagen
House
,
without
meet
anything
calculate
to
dispel
our
impression
that
there
be
a
mistake
in
the
almanack
,
we
turn
back
down
Maidenlane
,
with
the
intention
of
pass
through
the
extensive
colony
lie
between
it
and
Battle
-
bridge
,
which
be
inhabit
by
proprietor
of
donkey
-
cart
,
boiler
of
horse
-
flesh
,
maker
of
tile
,
and
sifter
of
cinder
;
through
which
colony
we
should
have
pass
,
without
stoppage
or
interruption
,
if
a
little
crowd
gather
round
a
shed
have
not
attract
our
attention
,
and
induce
us
to
pause
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
say
a
"
shed
,
"
we
do
not
mean
the
conservatory
sort
of
building
,
which
,
accord
to
the
old
song
,
Love
tenant
when
he
be
a
young
man
,
but
a
wooden
house
with
window
stuff
with
rag
and
paper
,
and
a
small
yard
at
the
side
,
with
one
dust
-
cart
,
two
basket
,
a
few
shovel
,
and
little
heap
of
cinder
,
and
fragment
of
china
and
tile
,
scatter
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
before
this
invite
spot
we
pause
;
and
the
longer
we
look
,
the
more
we
wonder
what
exciting
circumstance
it
could
be
,
that
induce
the
foremost
member
of
the
crowd
to
flatten
their
nose
against
the
parlour
window
,
in
the
vain
hope
of
catch
a
glimpse
of
what
be
go
on
inside
.
 
<EOS>
after
stare
vacantly
about
us
for
some
minute
,
we
appeal
,
touch
the
cause
of
this
assemblage
,
to
a
gentleman
in
a
suit
of
tarpaulin
,
who
be
smoke
his
pipe
on
our
right
hand
;
but
as
the
only
answer
we
obtain
be
a
playful
inquiry
whether
our
mother
have
dispose
of
her
mangle
,
we
determine
to
await
the
issue
in
silence
.
   
<EOS>
Judge
of
our
virtuous
indignation
,
when
the
street

door
of
the
shed
open
,
and
a
party
emerge
therefrom
,

in

the

<EOS>
when
we
affirm
that
broker

be
strange
place

and
that
if
an
authentic
history
of
their
content
could
be
procure
,
it
would
furnish
many
a
page
of
amusement
,
and
many
a
melancholy
tale
,
it
be
necessary
to
explain
the
class
of
shop
to
which
we
allude
.
<EOS>
perhaps
when
we
make
use
of
the
term
"
Brokers
'
shop
,
"
the
mind
of
our
reader
will
at
once
picture
large

handsome

exhibit
a
long
perspective
of
French

polish
dining
-
table
,
rosewood
chiffonier
,
and
mahogany

-
stand
,
with
an
occasional
vista
of
a

and
hanging
,
and
an
appropriate
foreground
of

chair

<EOS>
perhaps
they
will
imagine
that
we
mean
an
humble
class
of
second

hand
furniture
repository
.
 
<EOS>
Their
imagination
will
then
naturally
lead
them
to
that
street
at
the
back
of
Long

acre
,
which
be
compose
almost
entirely
of
broker
'
shop
;
where
you
walk
through
grove
of
deceitful
,
showy

look
furniture
,
and
where
the
prospect
be
occasionally
enliven
by
a
bright
red
,
blue
,
and
yellow
hearth
-
rug
,
embellish
with
the
pleasing
device
of
a
mail
-
coach
at
full
speed
,
or
a
strange
animal
,
suppose
to
have
be
originally
intend
for
a
dog
,
with
a
mass
of
worst
-
work
in
his
mouth
,
which
conjecture
have
liken
to
a
basket
of
flower
.
   
<EOS>
this
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
be
a
tempting
article
to
young
wife
in
the
humbler
rank
of
life
,
who
have
a
first

floor
front
to
furnish
---
they
be
lose
in
admiration
,
and
hardly
know
which
to
admire
most
.
<EOS>
the
dog
be
very
beautiful
,
but
they
have
a
dog
already
on
the
good
tea
-
tray
,
and
two
more
on
the
mantel
-
piece
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
there
be
something
so
genteel
about
that
mail
-
coach
;
and
the
passenger
outside
(
who
be
all
hat
)
give
it
such
an
air
of
reality
!
   
<EOS>
the
good
here
be
adapt
to
the
taste
,
or
rather
to
the
mean
,
of
cheap
purchaser
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
some
of
the
most
beautiful
LOOKING
Pembroke
table
that
be
ever
beheld
:
 
the
wood
as
green
as
the
tree
in
the
Park
,
and
the
leave
almost
as
certain
to
fall
off
in
the
course
of
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
also
a
most
extensive
assortment
of
tent
and
turn
-
up
bedstead
,
make
of
stained
wood
,
and
innumerable
specimen
of
that
base
imposition
on
society
---
a
sofa
bedstead
.
   
<EOS>
a
turn
-
up
bedstead
be
a
blunt
,
honest
piece
of
furniture
;
it
may
be
slightly
disguise
with
a
sham
drawer
;
and
sometimes
a
mad
attempt
be
even
make
to
pass
it
off
for
a
book
-
case
;
ornament
it
as
you
will
,
however
,
the
turn
-
up
bedstead
seem
to
defy
disguise
,
and
to
insist
on
have
it
distinctly
understand
that
he
be
a
turn
-
up
bedstead
,
and
nothing
else
---
that
he
be
indispensably
necessary
,
and
that
be
so
useful
,
he
disdain
to
be
ornamental
.
   
<EOS>
how
different
be
the
demeanour
of
a
sofa
bedstead
!
 
<EOS>
Ashamed
of
its
real
use
,
it
strive
to
appear
an
article
of
luxury
and
gentility
---
an
attempt
in
which
it
miserably
fail
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
neither
the
respectability
of
a
sofa
,
nor
the
virtue
of
a
bed
;
every
man
who
keep
a
sofa
bedstead
in
his
house
,
become
a
party
to
a
wilful
and
design
fraud
---
we
question
whether
you
could
insult
him
more
,
than
by
insinuate
that
you
entertain
the
least
suspicion
of
its
real
use
.
   
<EOS>
to
return
from
this
digression
,
we
beg
to
say
,
that
neither
of
these

Imagine

and
you
have
before
you
precisely
the
kind
of

to
which
we
wish

direct
your
attention
.
   
<EOS>
although
the
same
heterogeneous
mixture
of
thing
will
be
find
at
all
these
place

it
be
curious
to
observe
how
truly
and
accurately
some
of
the
minor
article
which
be
expose
for
sale
---
article
of
wear
apparel
,
for

---
mark
the

<EOS>
take
Drury

example

<EOS>
this
be
essentially
a

<EOS>
there

they

contemplate
a

portrait
of
Mr

Royal
Coburg
Theatre
,
"
as
he
appear
in
the
character

"
 
<EOS>
the
consequence
be
,
that
there
be
not
a
marine

store
shop
in
the
neighbourhood
,
which
do
not
exhibit
for

some

such

<EOS>
there
be
several
of
these
shop
in
the
narrow
street

dirty
court
,
of
which
there
be
so
many
near
the
national
theatre
,
and
they
all
have
tempting
good
of
this
description
,
with
the
addition
,
perhaps
,
of
a
lady

pink
dress
cover
with
spangle
;
white
wreath
,
stage
shoe
,
and
a

like
a
tin

<EOS>
They
have
be
purchase

some
wretched

be

who

on

make
certain
weekly
payment
,
amount
in
the
whole
to
about
ten
time
their
value
,
may
avail
themselves
of
such
desirable
bargain
.
   
<EOS>
let
us
take
a
very
different
quarter
,
and
apply
it
to
the
same
test
.
 
<EOS>
look
at
a
marine
-
store
dealer
's
,
in
that
reservoir
of
dirt
,
drunkenness
,
and
drabs
:
 
thief
,
oyster
,
baked
potato
,
and
pickle
salmon
---
ratcliff

highway
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
the
wear
apparel
be
all
nautical
.
 
<EOS>
rough
blue

,
with
mother
-
of

pearl
button
,
oil
-
skin
hat
,
coarse
check
shirt
,
and
large
canvas
trouser
that
look
as
if
they
be
make
for
a
pair
of
body
instead
of
a
pair
of
leg
,
be
the
staple
commodity
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
there
be
large
bunche
of
cotton
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
,
in
colour
and
pattern
unlike
any
one
ever
see
before
,
with
the
exception
of
those
on
the
back
of
the
three
young
lady
without
bonnet
who
pass
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
the
furniture
be
much
the
same
as
elsewhere
,
with
the
addition
of
one
or
two
model
of
ship
,
and
some
old
print
of
naval
engagement
in
still
old
frame
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
window
,
be
a
few
compass
,
a
small
tray
contain
silver
watch
in
clumsy
thick
case
;
and
tobacco

box
,
the
lid
of
each
ornament
with
a
ship
,
or
an
anchor
,
or
some
such
trophy
.
 
<EOS>
a
sailor
generally
pawn
or
sell
all
he
have
before
he
have
be
long
ashore
,
and
if
he
do
not
,
some
favour
companion
kindly
save
him
the
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
in
either
case
,
it
be
an
even
chance
that
he
afterwards
unconsciously
repurchase
the
same
thing
at
a
high
price
than
he
give
for
them
at
first
.
   
<EOS>
again
:
 
pay
a
visit
with
a
similar
object
,
to
a
part
of
London
,
as
unlike
both
of
these
as
they
be
to
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
Cross
over
to
the
Surrey

and
look
at

in

<EOS>
how
different

<EOS>
imprisonment

<EOS>
there

contamination

first

watch

then

all
the
more
expensive

<EOS>
that

Gin

shop
<EOS>
It
be
a
remarkable
circumstance
,
that
different
trade
appear
to
partake
of
the
disease
to
which
elephant
and
dog
be
especially
liable
,
and
to
run
stark
,
stare
,
rave
mad
,
periodically
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
distinction
between
the
animal
and
the
trade
,
be
,
that
the
former
run
mad
with
a
certain
degree
of
propriety
---
they
be
very
regular
in
their
irregularity
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
the
period
at
which
the
emergency
will
arise
,
and
provide
against
it
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
if
an
elephant
run
mad
,
we
be
all
ready
for
him
---
kill
or
cure
---
pill
or
bullet
,
calomel
in
conserve
of
rose
,
or
lead
in
a
musket
-
barrel
.
 
<EOS>
if
a
dog
happen
to
look
unpleasantly
warm
in
the
summer
month
,
and
to
trot
about
the
shady
side
of
the
street
with
a
quarter
of
a
yard
of
tongue
hang
out
of
his
mouth
,
a
thick
leather
muzzle
,
which
have
be
previously
prepare
in
compliance
with
the
thoughtful
injunction
of
the
Legislature
,
be
instantly
clap
over
his
head
,
by
way
of
make
him
cool
,
and
he
either
look
remarkably
unhappy
for
the
next
six
week
,
or
become
legally
insane
,
and
go
mad
,
as
it
be
,
by
Act
of
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
but
these
trade
be
as
eccentric
as
comet
;
nay
,
bad
,
for
no
one
can
calculate
on
the
recurrence
of
the
strange
appearance
which
betoken
the

<EOS>
moreover

the
contagion

general

the
quickness

We

six

answer
without

hesitation
the
usual
question

put
in
a
rather
respectful
manner

in
a
much
low

the

property

prize

perhaps
,
once
,
for
the
giver

part
with
now
without
a
struggle

for
want

harden
the

her
example
have
harden
the

the
prospect

money

couple
with
a
recollection
of
the
misery
they
have
both
endure
from
the
want
of
it
---
the
coldness
of
old
friend
---
the
stern
refusal
of
some

and
the
still
more
gall
compassion
of
other

appear
to
have
obliterate
the
consciousness
of
self

humiliation
,
which
the
idea

once
have
arouse

in

next
box

be
a
young
female

whose
attire

miserably
poor

but
extremely
gaudy
,
wretchedly
cold

but
extravagantly
fine
,
too
plainly
bespeak
her
station

<EOS>
the
rich
satin
gown
with
its
fade
trimming
,
the
wear
-
out
thin
shoe
,
and
pink
silk
stocking
,
the
summer
bonnet
in
winter
,
and
the
sunken
face

where
a
daub
of
rouge
only
serve
as
an
index
to
the
ravage
of
squander
health
never
to

regain

and
lose
happiness
never
to

restore

and
where
the
practise
smile
be
a
wretched
mockery
of
the
misery
of
the
heart
,
can
not
be
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
the
glimpse
she
have
just
catch
of
her
young
neighbour
,
and
in
the
sight
of
the
little
trinket
she
have
offer
in
pawn
,
that
seem
to
have
awaken
in
this
woman
's
mind
some
slumbering
recollection
,
and
to
have
change
,
for
an
instant
,
her
whole
demeanour
.
 
<EOS>
Her
first
hasty
impulse
be
to
bend
forward
as
if
to
scan
more
minutely
the
appearance
of
her
half

conceal
companion
;
her
next
,
on
see
them
involuntarily
shrink
from
her
,
to
retreat
to
the
back
of
the
box
,
cover
her
face
with
her
hand
,
and
burst
into
tear
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
strange
chord
in
the
human
heart
,
which
will
lie
dormant
through
year
of
depravity
and
wickedness
,
but
which
will
vibrate
at
last
to
some
slight
circumstance
apparently
trivial
in
itself
,
but
connect
by
some
undefined
and
indistinct
association
,
with
past
day
that
can
never
be
recall
,
and
with
bitter
recollection
from
which
the
most
degraded
creature
in
existence
can
not
escape
.
   
<EOS>
there
have
be
another
spectator
,
in
the
person
of
a
woman
in
the
common
shop
;
the
low
of
the
low
;
dirty
,
unbonneted
,
flaunting
,
and
slovenly
.
 
<EOS>
Her
curiosity
be
at
first
attract
by
the
little
she
could
see
of
the
group
;
then
her
attention
.
 
<EOS>
the
half
-
intoxicated
leer
change
to
an
expression
of
something
like
interest
,
and
a
feeling
similar
to
that
we
have
describe
,
appear
for
a
moment
,
and
only
a
moment
,
to
extend
itself
even
to
her
bosom
.

who
shall
say
how
soon
these
woman
may
change

have
terminate

<EOS>
We
shall
never
forget
the
mingled
feeling
of
awe
and
respect
with
which
we
use
to
gaze
on
the
exterior
of
Newgate
in
our
schoolboy
day
.
 
<EOS>
how
dreadful
its
rough
heavy
wall
,
and
low
massive
door
,
appear
to
us
---
the
latter
look
as
if
they
be
make
for
the
express
purpose
of
let
people
in
,
and
never
let
them
out
again
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
fetter
over
the
debtor
'
door
,
which
we
use
to
think
be
a
bona
FIDE
set
of
iron
,
just
hang
up
there
,
for
convenience
"
sake
,
ready
to
be
take
down
at
a
moment
's
notice
,
and
rivet
on
the
limb
of
some
refractory
felon
!
 
<EOS>
We
be
never
tired
of
wonder
how
the
hackney
-
coachman
on
the
opposite
stand
could
cut
joke
in
the
presence
of
such
horror
,
and
drink
pot
of
half
-
and
-
half
so
near
the
last
drop
.
   
<EOS>
often
have
we
stray
here
,
in
session
time
,
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
whipping
-
place
,
and
that
dark
build
on
one
side
of
the
yard
,
in
which
be
keep
the
gibbet
with
all
its
dreadful
apparatus
,
and
on
the
door
of
which
we
half
expect
to
see
a
brass
plate
,
with
the
inscription
"
Mr
Ketch
;
"
for
we
never
imagine
that
the
distinguished
functionary
could
by
possibility
live
anywhere
else
!
<EOS>
the
day
of
these
childish
dream
have
pass
away
,
and
with
them
many
other
boyish
idea
of
a
gayer
nature
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
still
retain
so
much
of
our
original
feeling
<EOS>
,
that
to
this
hour
we
never
pass
the
building
without
something
like
a
shudder
.
   
<EOS>
what
London
pedestrian
be
there
who
have
not
,
at
some
time
or
other
,
cast
a
hurried
glance
through
the
wicket
at
which
prisoner
be
admit
into
this
gloomy
mansion
,
and
survey
the
few
object
he
could
discern
,
with
an
indescribable
feeling
of
curiosity
?
 
<EOS>
the
thick
door
,
plate
with
iron
and
mount
with
spike
,
just
low
enough
to
enable
you
to
see
,
lean
over
them
,
an
ill
-
look
fellow
,
in
a
broad
-
brim
hat
,
Belcher
handkerchief
and
top
-
boot
:
with
a
brown
coat
,
something
between
a
great
-
coat
and
a
"
sporting
"
jacket
,
on
his
back
,
and
an
immense
key
in
his
left
hand
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
you
be
lucky
enough
to
pass
,
just
as
the
gate
be
be
open
;
then
,
you
see
on
the
other
side
of
the
lodge
,
another
gate
,
the
image
of
its
predecessor
,
and
two
or
three
more
turnkey
,
who
look
like
multiplication
of
the
first
one
,
seat
round
a
fire
which
just
light
up
the
whitewashed
apartment
sufficiently
to
enable
you
to
catch
a
hasty
glimpse
of
these
different
object
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
a
great
respect
for
Mrs
Fry
,
but
she
certainly
ought
to
have
write
more
romance
than
Mrs
Radcliffe
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
walk
leisurely
down
the
Old
Bailey
,
some
time
ago
,
when
,
as
we
pass
this
identical
gate
,
it
be
open
by
the
officiating
turnkey
.
 
<EOS>
We
turn
quickly
round
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
and
see
two
person
descend
the
step
.
 
<EOS>
We
could
not
help
stop
and
observe
them
.
   
<EOS>
They
be
an
elderly
woman
,
of
decent
appearance
,
though
evidently
poor
,
and
a
boy
of
about
fourteen
or
fifteen
.
 
<EOS>
the
woman
be
cry
bitterly
;
she
carry
a
small
bundle
in
her
hand
,
and
the
boy
follow
at
a
short
distance
behind
her
.
 
<EOS>
Their
little
history
be
obvious
.
 
<EOS>
the
boy
be
her
son
,
to
whose
early
comfort
she
have
perhaps
sacrifice
her
own
---
for
whose
sake
she
have
bear
misery
without
repine
,
and
poverty
without
a
murmur
---
look
steadily
forward
to
the
time
,
when
he
who
have
so
long
witness
her
struggle
for
himself
,
may
be
enable
to
make
some
exertion
for
their
joint
support
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
form
dissolute
connexion
;
idleness
have
lead
to
crime
;
and
he
have
be
commit
to
take
his
trial
for
some
petty
theft
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
long
in
prison
,
and
,
after
receive
some
trifle
additional
punishment
,
have
be
order
to
be
discharge
that
morning
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
his
first
offence
,
and
<EOS>
his
poor
old
mother
,
still
hope
to
reclaim
him
,
have
be
wait
at
the
gate
to
implore
him
to
return
home
.
   
<EOS>
We
can
not
forget
the
boy
;
he
descend
the
step
with
a
dogged
look
,
shake
his
head
with
an
air
of
bravado
and
obstinate
determination
.
 
<EOS>
They
walk
a
few
pace
,
and
pause
.
 
<EOS>
the
woman
put
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
in
an
agony
of
entreaty
,
and
the
boy
sullenly
raise
his
head
as
if
in
refusal
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
brilliant
morning
,
and
every
object
look
fresh
and
happy
in
the
broad
,
gay
sunlight
;
he
gaze
round
him
for
a
few
moment
,
bewilder
with
the
brightness
of
the
scene
,
for
it
be
long
since
he
have
behold
anything
save
the
gloomy
wall
of
a
prison
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
the
wretchedness
of
his
mother
make
some
impression
on
the
boy
's
heart
;
perhaps
some
undefined
recollection
of
the
time
when
he
be
a
happy
child
,
and
she
his
only
friend
,
and
good
companion
,
crowd
on
him
---
he
burst
into
tear
;
and
cover
his
face
with
one
hand
,
and
hurriedly
place
the
other
in
his
mother
's
,
walk
away
with
her
.
   
<EOS>
Curiosity
have
occasionally
lead
us
into
both
court
at
the
Old
Bailey
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
be
so
likely
to
strike
the
person
who
enter
them
for
the
first
time
,
as
the
calm
indifference
with
which
the
proceeding
be
conduct
;
every
trial
seem
a
mere
matter
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
deal
of
form
,
but
no
compassion
;
considerable
interest
,
but
no
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
take
the
Old
Court
for
example
.
 
<EOS>
there
sit
the
judge
,
with
whose
great
dignity
everybody
be
acquaint
,
and
of
whom
therefore
we
need
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
there
be
the
Lord
Mayor
in
the
centre
,
look
as
cool
as
a
Lord
Mayor
CAN
look
,
with
an
immense
bouquet
before
him
,
and
habit
in
all
the
splendour
of
his
office
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
there
be
the
Sheriffs
,
who
be
almost
as
dignified
as
the
Lord
Mayor
himself
;
and
<EOS>
the
Barristers
,
who
be
quite
dignified
enough
in
their
own
opinion
;
and
the
spectator
,
who
have
pay
for
their
admission
,
look
upon
the
whole
scene
as
if
it
be
get
up
especially
for
their
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
look
upon
the
whole
group
in
the
body
of
the
Court
---
some
wholly
engross
in
the
morning
paper
,
other
carelessly
converse
in
low
whisper
,
and
other
,
again
,
quietly
doze
away
an
hour
---
and
you
can
scarcely
believe
that
the
result
of
the
trial
be
a
matter
of
life
or
death
to
one
wretched
be
present
.
 
<EOS>
but
turn
your
eye
to
the
dock
;
watch
the
prisoner
attentively
for
a
few
moment
;
and
the
fact
be
before
you
,
in
all
its
painful
reality
.
 
<EOS>
Mark
how
restlessly
he
have
be
engage
for
the
last
ten
minute
,
in
form
all
sort
of
fantastic
figure
with
the
herb
which
be
strew
upon
the
ledge
before
him
;
observe
the
ashy
paleness
of
his
face
when
a
particular
witness
appear
,
and
how
he
change
his
position
and
wipe
his
clammy
forehead
,
and
feverish
hand
,
when
the
case
for
the
prosecution
be
close
,
as
if
it
be
a
relief
to
him
to
feel
that
the
jury
know
the
bad
.
   
<EOS>
the
defence
be
conclude
;
the
judge
proceed
to
sum
up
the
evidence
;
and
the
prisoner
watch
the
countenance
of
the
jury
,
as
a
die
man
,
cling
to
life
to
the
very
last
<EOS>
,
vainly
look
in
the
face
of
his
physician
for
a
slight
ray
of
hope
.
 
<EOS>
They
turn
round
to
consult
;
you
can
almost
hear
the
man
's
heart
beat
,
as
he
bite
the
stalk
of
rosemary
,
with
a
desperate
effort
to
appear
compose
.
<EOS>
They
resume
their
place
---
a
dead
silence
prevail
as
the
foreman
deliver
in
the
verdict
---
"
guilty
!
"
 
<EOS>
a
shriek
burst
from
a
female
in
the
gallery
;
the
prisoner
cast
one
look
at
the
quarter
from
whence
the
noise
proceed
;
and
be
immediately
hurried
from
the
dock
by
the
gaoler
.
 
<EOS>
the
clerk
direct
one
of
the
officer
of
the
Court
to
"
take
the
woman
out
,
"
and
fresh
business
be
proceed
with
,
as
if
nothing
have
occur
.
   
<EOS>
no
imaginary
contrast
to
a
case
like
this
,
could
be
as
complete
as
that
which
be
constantly
present
in
the
New
Court
,
the
gravity
of
which
be
frequently
disturb
in
no
small
degree
,
by
the
cunning
and
pertinacity
of
juvenile
offender
.
 
<EOS>
a
boy
of
thirteen
be
try
,
say
for
pick
the
pocket
of
some
subject
of
her
Majesty
,
and
the
offence
be
about
as
clearly
prove
as
an
offence
can
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
call
upon
for
his
defence
,
and
content
himself
with
a
little
declamation
about
the
jurymen
and
his
country
---
assert
that
all
the
witness
have
commit
perjury
,
and
hint
that
the
police
force
generally
have
enter
into
a
conspiracy
"
again
'
"
him
.
<EOS>
however
probable
this
statement
may
be
,
it
fail
to
convince
the
Court
,
and
some
such
scene
as
the
follow
then
take
place
:
   
court
:
 
<EOS>
have
you
any
witness
to
speak
to
your
character
,
boy
?
   
<EOS>
boy
:
 
<EOS>
yes
,
my
Lord
;
fifteen
gen'lm'n
be
a

outside
,
and
vos
a

all

the

<EOS>
my

vos

<EOS>
court
.
 
<EOS>
Inquire
for
these
witness
.
   
<EOS>
here
,
a
stout
beadle
run
out
,
and
vociferate
for
the
witness
at
the
very
top
of
his
voice
;
for
you
hear
his
cry
grow
fainter
and
fainter
as
he
descend
the
step
into
the
court
-
yard
below
.
 
<EOS>
after
an
absence
of
five
minute
,
he
return
,
very
warm
and
hoarse
,
and
inform
the
Court
of
what
it
know
perfectly
well
before
---
namely
,
that
there
be
no
such
witness
in
attendance
.
 
<EOS>
Hereupon
,
the
boy
set
up
a
most
awful
howling
;
screw
the
low
part
of
the
palm
of
his
hand
into
the
corner
of
his
eye
;
and
endeavour
to
look
the
picture
of
injure
innocence
.
 
<EOS>
the
jury
at
once
find
him
"
guilty
,
"
and
his
endeavour
to
squeeze
out
a
tear
or
two
be
redouble
.
 
<EOS>
the
governor
of
the
gaol
then
state
,
in
reply
to
an
inquiry
from
the
bench
,
that
the
prisoner
have
be
under
his
care
twice
before
.
<EOS>
this
the
urchin
resolutely
deny
in
some
such
term
as
---
"
s'elp
me
,
gen'lm'n
,
I
never

It

"
   
<EOS>
this
representation
,
like
the
defence
,
fail
in
produce
the
desire
effect
,
and
the
boy
be
sentence
,
perhaps
,
to
seven
year
'
transportation
.
 
<EOS>
find
it
impossible
to
excite
compassion
,
he
give
vent
to
his
feeling
in
an
imprecation
bear
reference
to
the
eye
of
"
old

"
<EOS>
and
as
he
decline
to
take
the
trouble
of
walk
from
the
dock
,
be
forthwith
carry
out
,
congratulate
himself
on

<EOS>
a
visit
to
Newgate
"
<EOS>
the
force

be
a
trite
phrase
in
everybody
's
mouth
;
and
it
be
not
a
little
remarkable
that
those
who
use
it
most
as
apply
to
other
,
unconsciously
afford
in
their
own
person
singular
example
of
the
power
which
habit
and
custom
exercise
over
the
mind
of
man

and
of
the
little
reflection
they
be
apt
to
bestow
on
subject
with
which
every
day

experience
have
render
them
familiar

<EOS>
if

could
be
suddenly
remove
like
another
Aladdin

and
set
down
on
the

a
hundred
,
whose
road
to
business
every
morning
lie
through
Newgate
-
street
,
or
the
Old

would
pass
the

without
bestow
a
hasty
glance
on
its
small

grate
window
,
and
a
transient
thought
upon
the
condition
of
the
unhappy
being
immure
in
its
dismal
cell
;
and
yet
these
same
man

and
hour

pass
and
repass
this
gloomy
depository
of
the
guilt
and
misery
of
London
,
in
one
perpetual
stream
of

and
bustle
,
utterly
unmindful
of

wretched

or
if

the

that

they

shameful

contact

death
even
in
its

terrible

be
solemn

appalling

<EOS>
how
much
more
awful
be
it
to
reflect
on
this
near
vicinity
to
the
dying
---
to
man
in
full
health
and
vigour
,
in
the
flower
of
youth
or
the
prime
of
life
,
with
all
their

as
acute

indelibly

It

some
such
thought
as
these
that
we
determine
,
not
many
week
since
,
to
visit
the
interior
of
Newgate
---
in
an
amateur
capacity
,
of
course
;
and
,
have
carry
our
intention
into
effect
,
we
proceed
to
lay
its
result
before
our
reader
,
in
the
hope
---
found
more
upon
the
nature
of
the
subject
,
than
on
any
presumptuous
confidence
in
our
own
descriptive
power
---
that
this
paper
may
not
be
find
wholly
devoid
of
interest
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
only
to
premise
,
that
we
do
not
intend
to
fatigue
the
reader
with
any
statistical
account
of
the
prison
;
they
will
be
find
at
length
in
numerous
report
of
numerous
committee
,
and
a
variety
of
authority
of
equal
weight
.
 
<EOS>
We
take
no
note
,
make
no
memoranda
,
measure
none
of
the
yard
,
ascertain
the
exact
number
of
inch
in
no
particular
room
:
 
be
unable
even
to
report
of
how
many
apartment
the
gaol
be
compose
.
   
<EOS>
We
see
the
prison
,
and
see
the
prisoner
;
and
what
we
do
see
,
and
what
we
think
,
we
will
tell
at
once
in
our
own
way
.
   
<EOS>
have
deliver
our
credential
to
the
servant
who
answer
our
knock
at
the
door
of
the
governor
's
house
,
we
be
usher
into
the
"
office
;
"
a
little
room
,
on
the
right
-
hand
side
as
you
enter
,
with
two
window
look
into
the
Old
Bailey
:
 
fit
up
like
an
ordinary
attorney
's
office
,
or
merchant
's
counting
-
house
,
with
the
usual
fixture
---
a
wainscote
partition
,
a
shelf
or
two
,
a
desk
,
a
couple
of
stool
,
a
pair
of
clerk
,
an
almanack
,
a
clock
,
and
a
few
map
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
little
delay
,
occasion
by
send
into
the
interior
of
the
prison
for
the
officer
whose
duty
it
be
to
conduct
us
,
that
functionary
arrive
;
a
respectable
-
looking
man
of
about
two
or
three
and
fifty
,
in
a
broad
-
brim
hat
,
and
full
suit
of
black
,
who
,
but
for
his
key
,
would
have
look
quite
as
much
like
a
clergyman
as
a
turnkey
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
disappoint
;
he
have
not
even
top
-
boot
on
.
 
<EOS>
follow
our
conductor
by
a
door
opposite
to
that
<EOS>
at
which
we
have
enter
,
we
arrive
at
a
small
room
,
without
any
other
furniture
than
a
little
desk
,
with
a
book
for
visitor
'
autograph
,
and
a
shelf
,
on
which
be
a
few
box
for
paper
,
and
cast
of
the
head
and
face
of
the
two
notorious
murderer
,
Bishop
and
Williams
;
the
former
,
in
particular
,
exhibit
a
style
of
head
and
set
of
feature
,
which
may
have
afford
sufficient
moral
ground
for
his
instant
execution
at
any
time
,
even
have
there
be
no
other
evidence
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
leave
this
room
also
,
by
an
opposite
door
,
we
find
ourself
in
the
lodge
which
open
on
the
Old
Bailey
;
one
side
of
which
be
plentifully
garnish
with
a
choice
collection
of
heavy
set
of
iron
,
include
those
wear
by
the
redoubtable
Jack
Sheppard
---
genuine
;
and
those
say
to
have
be
grace
by
the
sturdy
limb
of
the
no
less
celebrate
Dick
Turpin
---
doubtful
.
 
<EOS>
from
this
lodge
,
a
heavy
oaken
gate
,
bind
with
iron
,
stud
with
nail
of
the
same
material
,
and
guard
by
another
turnkey
,
open
on
a
few
step
,
if
we
remember
right
,
which
terminate
in
a
narrow
and
dismal
stone
passage
,
run
parallel
with
the
Old
Bailey
,
and
lead
to
the
different
yard
,
through
a
number
of
tortuous
and
intricate
winding
,
guard
in
their
turn
by
huge
gate
and
grating
,
whose
appearance
be
sufficient
to
dispel
at
once
the
slight
hope
of
escape
that
any
new
-
comer
may
have
entertain
;
and
the
very
recollection
of
which
,
on
eventually
traverse
the
place
again
,
involve
one
in
a
maze
of
confusion
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
to
explain
here
,
that
the
building
in
the
prison
,
or
in
other
word
the
different
ward
---
form
a
square
,
of
which
the
four
side
abut
respectively
on
the
Old
Bailey
,
the
old
College
of
Physicians
(
now
form
a
part
of
Newgate
-
market
)
,
the
Sessions
-
house
,
and
Newgate
-
street
.
 
<EOS>
the
intermediate
space
be
divide
into
several
pave
yard
,
in
which
the
prisoner
take
such
air
and
exercise
as
can
be
have
in
such
a
place
.
 
<EOS>
these
yard
,
with
the
exception
of
that
in
which
prisoner
under
sentence
of
death
be
confine
(
of
which
we
shall
presently
give
a
more
detailed
description
)
,
run
parallel
with
Newgate
-
street
,
and
consequently
from
the
Old
Bailey
,
as
it
be
,
to
Newgate
-
market
.
 
<EOS>
the
woman
's
side
be
in
the
right
wing
of
the
prison
near
the
Sessions
-
house
.
<EOS>
as
we
be
introduce
into
this
part
of
the
building
first
,
we
will
adopt
the
same
order
,
and
introduce
our
reader
to
it
also
.
   
<EOS>
turn
to
the
right
,
then
,
down
the
passage
to
which
we
just
now
advert
,
omit
any
mention
of
intervene
gate
<EOS>
---
for
if
we
notice
every
gate
that
be
unlocked
for
us
to
pass
through
,
and
lock
again
as
soon
as
we
have
pass
,
we
should
require
a
gate
at
every
comma
<EOS>
---
we
come
to
a
door
compose
of
thick
bar
of
wood
,
through
which
be
discernible
,
pass
to
and
fro
in
a
narrow
yard
,
some
twenty
woman
:
 
the
majority
of
whom
,
however
,
as
soon
as
they
be
aware
of
the
presence
of
stranger
,
retreat
to
their
ward
.
 
<EOS>
one
side
of
this
yard
be
rail
off
at
a
considerable
distance
,
and
form
into
a
kind
of
iron
cage
,
about
five
foot
ten
inch
in
height
,
roof
at
the
top
,
and
defend
in
front
by
iron
bar
,
from
which
the
friend
of
the
female
prisoner
communicate
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
corner
of
this
singular
-
looking
den
,
be
a
yellow
,
haggard
,
decrepit
old
woman
,
in
a
tattere
gown
that
have
once
be
black
,
and
the
remain
of
an
old
straw
bonnet
,
with
fade
ribbon
of
the
same
hue
,
in
earnest
conversation
with
a
young
girl
---
a
prisoner
,
of
course
---
of
about
two
-
and
-
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
imagine
a
more
poverty
-
stricken
object
,
or
a
creature
so
borne
down
in
soul
and
body
,
by
excess
of
misery
and
destitution
,
as
the
old
woman
.
 
<EOS>
the
girl
be
a
good
-
looking
,
robust
female
,
with
a
profusion
of
hair
stream
about
in
the
wind
---
for
she
have
no
bonnet
on
---
and
a
man
's
silk
pocket
-
handkerchief
loosely
throw
over
a
most
ample
pair
of
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
woman
be
talk
in
that
low
,
stifle
tone
of
voice
which
tell
so
forcibly
of
mental
anguish
;
and
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
burst
into
an
irrepressible
sharp
,
abrupt
cry
of
grief
,
the
most
distressing
sound
that
ear
can
hear
.
<EOS>
the
girl
be
perfectly
unmoved
.
 
<EOS>
Hardened
beyond
all
hope
of
redemption
,
she
listen
doggedly
to
her
mother
's
entreaty
,
whatever
they
be
:
 
and
,
beyond
inquire
after
"
Jem
,
"
and
eagerly
catch
at
the
few
halfpence
her
miserable
parent
have
bring
her
,
take
no
more
apparent
interest
in
the
conversation
than
the
most
unconcerned
spectator
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
know
there
be
enough
of
them
,
in
the
person
of
the
other
prisoner
in
the
yard
,
who
be
no
more
concerned
by
what
be
pass
before
their
eye
,
and
within
their
hearing
,
than
if
they
be
blind
and
deaf
.
 
<EOS>
why
should
they
be
?
<EOS>
inside
the
prison
,
and
out
,
such
scene
be
too
familiar
to
them
,
to
excite
even
a
pass
thought
,
unless
of
ridicule
or
contempt
for
feeling
which
they
have
long
since
forget
.
   
<EOS>
a
little
farther
on
,
a
squalid
-
look
woman
in
a
slovenly
,
thick
-
bordered
cap
,
with
her
arm
muffle
in
a
large
red
shawl
,
the
fringed
end
of
which
straggle
nearly
to
the
bottom
of
a
dirty
white
apron
,
be
communicate
some
instruction
to
HER
visitor
---
her
daughter
evidently
.
 
<EOS>
the
girl
be
thinly
clothe
,
and
shake
with
the
cold
.
 
<EOS>
some
ordinary
word
of
recognition
pass
between
her
and
her
mother
when
she
appear
at
the
grating
,
but
neither
hope
,
condolence
,
regret
,
nor
affection
be
express
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
the
mother
whisper
her
instruction
,
and
the
girl
receive
them
with
her
pinch
-
up
,
half
-
starve
feature
twist
into
an
expression
of
careful
cunning
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
some
scheme
for
the
woman
's
defence
that
she
be
disclose
,
perhaps
;
and
a
sullen
smile
come
over
the
girl
's
face
for
an
instant
,
as
if
she
be
pleased
:
 
not
so
much
at
the
probability
of
her
mother
's
liberation
,
as
at
the
chance
of
her
"
get
off
"
in
spite
of
her
prosecutor
.
 
<EOS>
the
dialogue
be
soon
conclude
;
and
with
the
same
careless
indifference
with
which
they
have
approach
each
other
,
the
mother
turn
towards
the
inner
end
of
the
yard
,
and
the
girl
to
the
gate
at
which
she
have
enter
.
   
<EOS>
the
girl
belong
to
a
class
---
unhappily
but
too
extensive
---
the
very
existence
of
which
,
should
make
man
's
heart
bleed
.
 
<EOS>
barely
past
her
childhood
,
it
require
but
a
glance
to
discover
that
she
be
one
of
those
child
,
bear
and
breed
in
neglect
and
vice
,
who
have
never
know
what
childhood
be
:
 
who
have
never
be
teach
to
love
and
court
a
parent
's
smile
,
or
to
dread
a
parent
's
frown
.
 
<EOS>
the
thousand
nameless
endearment
of
childhood
,
its
gaiety
and
its
innocence
,
be
alike
unknown
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
enter
at
once
upon
the
stern
reality
and
misery
of
life
,
and
to
their
well
nature
it
be
almost
hopeless
to
appeal
in
after
-
time
,
by
any
of
the
reference
which
will
awaken
,
if
it
be
only
for
a
moment
,
some
good
feeling
in
ordinary
bosom
,
however
corrupt
they
may
have
become
.
 
<EOS>
talk
to
them
of
parental
solicitude
,
the
happy
day
of
childhood
,
and
the
merry
game
of
infancy
!
 
<EOS>
tell
them
of
hunger
and
the
street
,
beggary
and
stripes
,
the
gin
-
shop
,
the
station
-
house
,
and
the
pawnbroker
's
,
and
they
will
understand
you
.
   
<EOS>
two
or
three
woman
be
stand
at
different
part
of
the
grating
,
converse
with
their
friend
,
but
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
prisoner
appear
to
have
no
friend
at
all
,
beyond
such
of
their
old
companion
as
may
happen
to
be
within
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
pass
hastily
down
the
yard
,
and
pause
only
for
an
instant
to
notice
the
little
incident
we
have
just
record
,
we
be
conduct
up
a
clean
and
well
-
light
flight
of
stone
stair
to
one
of
the
ward
.
<EOS>
there
be
several
in
this
part
of
the
building
,
but
a
description
of
one
be
a
description
of
the
whole
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
spacious
,
bare
,
whitewash
apartment
,
light
,
of
course
,
by
window
look
into
the
interior
of
the
prison
,
but
far
more
light
and
airy
than
one
could
reasonably
expect
to
find
in
such
a
situation
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
large
fire
with
a
deal
table
before
it
,
round
which
<EOS>
ten
or
a
dozen
woman
be
seat
on
wooden
form
at
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
along
both
side
of
the
room
run
a
shelf
;
below
it
,
at
regular
interval
,
a
row
of
large
hook
be
fix
in
the
wall
,
on
each
of
which
be
hang
the
sleep
mat
of
a
prisoner
:
 
her
rug
and
blanket
be
fold
up
,
and
place
on
the
shelf
above
.
 
<EOS>
at
night
,
these
mat
be
place
on
the
floor
,
each
beneath
the
hook
on
which
it
hang
during
the
day
;
and
the
ward
be
thus
make
to
answer
the
purpose
both
of
a
day
-
room
and
sleep
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
over
the
fireplace
,
be
a
large
sheet
of
pasteboard
,
on
which
be
display
a
variety
of
text
from
Scripture
,
which
be
also
scatter
about
the
room
in
scrap
about
the
size
and
shape
of
the
copy
-
slip
which
be
use
in
school
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
table
be
a
sufficient
provision
of
a
kind
of
stewed
beef
and
brown
bread
,
in
pewter
dish
,
which
be
keep
perfectly
bright
,
and
display
on
shelf
in
great
order
and
regularity
when
they
be
not
in
use
.
   
<EOS>
the
woman
rise
hastily
,
on
our
entrance
,
and
retire
in
a
hurried
manner
to
either
side
of
the
fireplace
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
all
cleanly
---
<EOS>
many
of
them
decently
---
attire
,
and
there
be
nothing
peculiar
,
either
in
their
appearance
or
demeanour
.
 
<EOS>
one
or
two
resume
the
needlework
which
they
have
probably
lay
aside
at
the
commencement
of
their
meal
;
other
gaze
at
the
visitor
with
listless
curiosity
;
and
a
few
retire
behind
their
companion
to
the
very
end
of
the
room
,
as
if
desirous
to
avoid
even
the
casual
observation
of
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
some
old
irish
woman
,
both
in
this
and
other
ward
,
to
whom
the
thing
be
no
novelty
,
appear
perfectly
indifferent
to
our
presence
,
and
remain
stand
close
to
the
seat
from
which
they
have
just
rise
;
but
the
general
feeling
among
the
female
seem
to
be
one
of
uneasiness
during
the
period
of
our
stay
among
them
:
 
which
be
very
brief
.
 
<EOS>
not
a
word
be
utter
during
the
time
of
our
remain
,
unless
,
indeed
,
by
the
wardswoman
in
reply
to
some
question
which
we
put
to
the
turnkey
who
accompany
us
.
 
<EOS>
in
every
ward
on
the
female
side
,
a
wardswoman
be
appoint
to
preserve
order
,
and
a
similar
regulation
be
adopt
among
the
male
.
 
<EOS>
the
wardsman
and
wardswoman
be
all
prisoner
,
select
for
good
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
They
alone
be
allow
the
privilege
of
sleep
on
bedstead
;
a
small
stump
bedstead
be
place
in
every
ward
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
on
both
side
of
the
gaol
,
be
a
small
receive
-
room
,
to
which
prisoner
be
conduct
on
their
first
reception
,
and
whence
they
can
not
be
remove
until
they
have
be
examine
by
the
surgeon
of
the
prison
.
<EOS>
(

)
   
retrace
our
step
to
the
dismal
passage
in

we
find
ourselves
at

(
and

the

contain
three

four
dark
cell
for
the
accommodation
of
refractory
prisoner

,
we
be
lead
through
a
narrow
yard
to
the
"
school
"
---
a
portion
of
the
prison
set
apart
for
boy
under
fourteen
year
of
age
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
tolerable

sized
room

in
which
be
writing

material
and
some
copy

book

be
the
schoolmaster
,
with
a
couple
of
his
pupil
;
the
remainder
have
be
fetch
from
an
adjoin
apartment
,
the
whole
be
draw
up
in
line
for
our
inspection
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
fourteen
of
them
in
all
,
some
with
shoe
,
some
without
;
some
in
pinafore
without
jacket
,
other
in
jacket
without
pinafore
,
and
one
in
scarce
anything
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
number
,
without
an
exception
we
believe
,
have
be
commit
for
trial
on
charge
of
pocket
-
picking
;
and
fourteen
such
terrible
little
face
we
never
beheld
.
<EOS>
---
there
be
not
one
redeem
feature
among
them
---
not
a
glance
of
honesty
---
not
a
wink
expressive
of
anything
<EOS>
but
the
gallow
and
the
hulk
,
in
the
whole
collection
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
anything
like
shame
or
contrition
,
that
be
entirely
out
of
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
evidently
quite
gratified
at
be
think
worth
the
trouble
of
look
at
;
their
idea
appear
to
be
,
that
we
have
come
to
see
Newgate
as
a
grand
affair
,
and
that
they
be
an
indispensable
part
of
the
show
;
and
every
boy
as
he
"
fall
in
"
to
the
line
,
actually
seem
as
pleased
and
important
as
if
he
have
do
something
excessively
meritorious
in
get
there
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
We
never
look
upon
a
more
disagreeable
sight
,
because
we
never
see
fourteen
such
hopeless
creature
of
neglect
,
before
.
   
<EOS>
on
either
side
of
the
school
-
yard
be
a
yard
for
man
,
in
one
of
which
---
that
towards
Newgate
-
street
---
prisoner
of
the
more
respectable
class
be
confine
.
 
<EOS>
of
the
other
,
we
have
little
description
to
offer
,
as
the
different
ward
necessarily
partake
of
the
same
character
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
provide
,
like
the
ward
on
the
woman
's
side
,
with
mat
and
rug
,
which
be
dispose
of
in
the
same
manner
during
the
day
;
the
only
very
striking
difference
between
their
appearance
and
that
of
the
ward
inhabit
by
the
female
,
be
the
utter
absence
of
any
employment
.
 
<EOS>
huddle
together
on
two
opposite
form
,
by
the
fireside
,
sit
twenty
man
perhaps
;
here
,
a
boy
in
livery
;
there
,
a
man
in
a
rough
great
-
coat
and
top
-
boot
;
farther
on
,
a
desperate
-
look
fellow
in
his
shirt
-
sleeve
,
with
an
old
Scotch
cap
upon
his
shaggy
head
;
near
him
again
,
a
tall
ruffian
,
in
a
smock
-
frock
;
<EOS>
next
to
him
,
a
miserable
being
of
distressed
appearance
,
with
his
head
rest
on
his
hand
;
---
all
alike
in
one
respect
,
all
idle
and
listless
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
do
leave
the
fire
,
saunter
moodily
about
,
lounge
in
the
window
,
or
lean
against
the
wall
,
vacantly
swinge
their
body
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
exception
of
a
man
read
an
old
newspaper
,
in
two
or
three
instance
,
this
be
the
case
in
every
ward
we
enter
.
   
<EOS>
the
only
communication
these
man
have
with
their
friend
,
be
through
two
close
iron
grating
,
with
an
intermediate
space
of
about
a
yard
in
width
between
the
two
,
so
that
nothing
can
be
hand
across
,
nor
can
the
prisoner
have
any
communication
by
touch
with
the
person
who
visit
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
married
man
have
a
separate
grating
,
at
which
to
see
their
wife
,
but
its
construction
be
the
same
.
   
<EOS>
the
prison
chapel
be
situate
at
the
back
of
the
governor
's
house
:
<EOS>
the
latter
have
no
window
look
into
the
interior
of
the
prison
.
 
<EOS>
whether
the
association
connect
with
the
place
---
the
knowledge
that
here
a
portion
of
the
burial
service
be
,
on
some
dreadful
occasion
,
perform
over
the
quick
and
not
upon
the
dead
---
cast
over
it
a
still
more
gloomy
and
sombre
air
than
art
have
impart
to
it
,
we
know
not
,
but
its
appearance
be
very
striking
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
a
silent
and
deserted
place
of
worship
,
solemn
and
impressive
at
any
time
;
and
the
very
dissimilarity
of
this
one
from
any
we
have
be
accustom
to
,
only
enhance
the
impression
.
 
<EOS>
the
meanness
of
its
appointment
---
the
bare
and
scanty
pulpit
,
with
the
paltry
paint
pillar
on
either
side
---
the
woman
's
gallery
with
its
great
heavy
curtain
---
<EOS>
the
man
's
with
its
unpainted
bench
and
dingy
front
---
the
totter
little
table
at
the
altar
,
with
the
commandment
on
the
wall
above
it
,
scarcely
legible
through
lack
of
paint
,
and
dust
and
damp
---
so
unlike
the
velvet
and
gilding
,
the
marble
and
wood
,
of
a
modern
church
---
be
strange
and
striking
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
one
object
,
too
,
which
rivet
the
attention
and
fascinate
the
gaze
,
and
from
which
we
may
turn
horror
-
stricken
in
vain
,
for
the
recollection
of
it
will
haunt
us
,
wake
and
sleep
,
for
a
long
time
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
immediately
below
the
reading
-
desk
,
on
the
floor
of
the
chapel
,
and
form
the
most
conspicuous
object
in
its
little
area
,
be
the
CONDEMNED
PEW
;
a
huge
black
pen
,
in
which
the
wretched
people
,
who
be
single
out
for
death
,
be
place
on
the
Sunday
precede
their
execution
,
in
sight
of
all
their
fellow
-
prisoner
,
from
many
of
whom
they
may
have
be
separate
but
a
week
before
,
to
hear
prayer
for
their
own
soul
,
to
join
in
the
response
of
their
own
burial
service
,
and
to
listen
to
an
address
,
warn
their
recent
companion
to
take
example
by
their
fate
,
and
urge
themselves
,
while
there
be
yet
time
---
nearly
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
---
to
"
turn
,
and
flee
from
the
wrath
to
come
!
"
<EOS>
imagine
what
have
be
the
feeling
of
the
man
whom
that
fearful
pew
have
enclose
,
and
of
whom
,
between
the
gallow
and
the
knife
,
no
mortal
remnant
may
now
remain
!
 
<EOS>
think
of
the
hopeless
cling
to
life
to
the
last
,
and
the
wild
despair
,
far
exceed
in
anguish
the
felon
's
death
itself
,
by
which
they
have
hear
the
certainty
of
their
speedy
transmission
to
another
world
,
with
all
their
crime
upon
their
head
,
ring
into
their
ear
by
the
officiate
clergyman
!
   
<EOS>
at
one
time
---
and
at
no
distant
period
either
---
the
coffin
of
the
man
about
to
be
execute
,
be
place
in
that
pew
,
upon
the
seat
by
their
side
,
during
the
whole
service
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
seem
incredible
,
but
it
be
true
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
hope
that
the
increase
spirit
of
civilisation
and
humanity
which
abolish
this
frightful
and
degrading
custom
,
may
extend
itself
to
other
usage
equally
barbarous
;
usage
which
have
not
even
the
plea
of
utility
in
their
defence
,
as
every
year
's
experience
have
show
them
to
be
more
and
more
inefficacious
.
   
<EOS>
leave
the
chapel
,
descend
to
the
passage
so
frequently
allude
to
,
and
cross
the
yard
before

prisoner
of
a
more
respectable
description
than

the

at
a
thick
iron
gate

great
size

before
another
gate

and

have

this
last
barrier
,
he

in
the
most
terrible
part
of
this
gloomy
building
---
the
condemn

<EOS>
the

well

towards

parallel

It

at

bottom
a
double
grating
(
of
which
the

similar

through

prisoner

the
result
of
the

man
of

,
from
a
harden
old
offender
with

of
three

to
a

not
fourteen
year
old

and
of
singularly
youthful
appearance
even
for
that
age
,
who
have
be
condemn
for
burglary
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
remarkable
in
the
appearance
of
these
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
one
or
two
decently
-
dress
man
be
brood
with
a
dejected
air
over
the
fire
;
several
little
group
of
two
or
three
have
be
engage
in
conversation
at
the
upper
end
of
the

,
or
in

the
remainder

round
a
young
man
seat
at
a

who
appear

engage
in
teach
the
young
one
to

<EOS>
the
room
be
large

airy
,
and
clean
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
very
little
anxiety
or
mental
suffering
depict
in
the
countenance
of
any
of
the
man
;
---
they
have
all
be
sentence
to
death
,
it
be
true
,
and
the
recorder
's
report
have
not
yet
be
make
;
but
,
we
question
whether
there
be
a
man
among
them
,
notwithstanding
,
who
do
not
know
that
although
he
have
undergo
the
ceremony
,
it
never
be
intend
that
his
life
should
be
sacrifice
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
table
lie
a
Testament
,
but
there
be
no
token
of
its
have
be
in
recent
use
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
press
-
room
below
,
be
three
man
,
the
nature
of
whose
offence
render
it
necessary
to
separate
them
,
even
from
their
companion
in
guilt
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
,
sombre
room
,
with
two
window
sink
into
the
stone
wall
,
and
here
the
wretched
man
be
pinion
on
the
morning
of
their
execution
,
before
move
towards
the
scaffold
.
<EOS>
the
fate
of
one
of
these
prisoner
be
uncertain
;
some
mitigatory
circumstance
have
come
to
light
since
his
trial
,
which
have
be
humanely
represent
in
the
proper
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
two
have
nothing
to
expect
from
the
mercy
of
the
crown
;
their
doom
be
seal
;
no
plea
could
be
urge
in
extenuation
of
their
crime
,
and
they
well
know
that
for
them
there
be
no
hope
in
this
world
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
two
short
one
,
"
the
turnkey
whisper
,
"
be
dead
man

"
   
<EOS>
the
man
to
whom
we
have
allude
as
entertain
some
hope
of
escape
,
be
lounge
,
at
the
great
distance
he
could
place
between
himself
and
his
companion
,
in
the
window
near
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
probably
aware
of
our
approach
,
and
have
assume
an
air
of
courageous
indifference
;
his
face
be
purposely
avert
towards
the
window
,
and
he
stir
not
an
inch
while
we
be
present
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
two
man
be
at
the
upper

<EOS>
one
of
them
,
who
be
imperfectly

have
his

the
other

<EOS>
the
light
fall
full
upon
him
,
and
communicate
to
his
pale
,
haggard
face
,
and
disorder
hair
,
an
appearance
which
,
at
that
distance
,
be
ghastly
.
 
<EOS>
His
cheek
rest
upon
his
hand
;
and
,
with
his
face
a
little
raised
,
and
his
eye
wildly
stare
before
him
,
he
seem
to
be
unconsciously
intent
on
count
the
chink
in
the
opposite
wall
.
 
<EOS>
We
pass
this
room
again
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
man

the

in

a
charcoal

He

both
in

in

he

constantly
attend
by

who
never
leave
him
on

<EOS>
We
enter
the
first
cell

<EOS>
It
be
a
stone
dungeon
,
eight
foot
long
by

with

bench
at

under
which

an
iron
candlestick

fix
into
the
wall
at
the
side
;
and
a
small
high
window
in
the
back
admit
as
much
air
and
light
as

struggle
in
between
a
double
row
of
heavy
,
crossed
iron
bar

<EOS>
It
contain
no

<EOS>
conceive
the
situation
of
a
man
,
spend
his
last
night
on
earth
in
this
cell
.
 
<EOS>
buoy
up
with
some
vague
and
undefined
hope
of
reprieve
,
he
know
not
why
---
<EOS>
indulge
in
some
wild
and
visionary
idea
of
escape
,
he
know

how
---
hour
after
hour
of
the
three

allow
him
for

with
a
speed
which
no
man
live
would
deem
possible
,
for
none
but
<EOS>
this
die
man
can
know
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
weary
his
friend
with
entreaty
,
exhaust
the
attendant
with
importunity
,
neglect
in
his
feverish
restlessness
the
timely
warning
of
his
spiritual
consoler
;
and
,
now
that
the
illusion
be
at
last
dispel
,
now
that
eternity
be
before
him
and
guilt
behind
,
now
that
his
fear
of
death
amount
almost
to
madness
,
and
an
overwhelming
sense
of
his
helpless
,
hopeless
state
rush
upon
him
,
he
be
lose
and
stupefy
,
and
have
neither
thought
to
turn
to
,
nor
power
to
call
upon
,
the
Almighty
Being
,
from
whom
alone
he
can
seek
mercy
and
forgiveness
,
and
before
whom
his
repentance
can
alone
avail
.
   
<EOS>
hour
have
glide
by
,
and
still
he
sit
upon
the
same
stone
bench
with
fold
arm
,
heedless
alike
of
the
fast
decrease
time
before
him
,
and
the
urgent
entreaty
of
the
good
man
at
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
the
feeble
light
be
waste
gradually
,
and
the
deathlike
stillness
of
the
street
without
,
break
only
by
the
rumbling
of
some
pass
vehicle
which
echo
mournfully
through
the
empty
yard
,
warn
him
that
the
night
be
wane
fast
away
.
 
<EOS>
the
deep
bell
of
St

strike
---
one
!
 
<EOS>
He
hear
it
;
it
have
rouse
him
.
 
<EOS>
seven
hour
leave
!
<EOS>
He
pace
the
narrow
limit
of
his
cell
with
rapid
stride
,
cold
drop
of
terror
start
on
his
forehead
,
and
every
muscle
of
his
frame
quiver
with
agony
.
 
<EOS>
seven
hour
!
 
<EOS>
He
suffer
himself
to
be
lead
to
his
seat
,
mechanically
take
the
bible
which
be
place
in
his
hand
,
and
try
to
read
and
listen
.
 
<EOS>
no
:
 
his
thought
will
wander
.
 
<EOS>
the
book
be
tear
and
soil
by
use
---
and
like
the
book
he
read
his
lesson
in
,
at
school
,
just
forty
year
ago
!
 
<EOS>
He
have
never
bestow
a
thought
upon
it
,
perhaps
,
since
he
leave
it
as
a
child
:
and
yet
the
place
,
the
time
,
the
room
---
nay
,
the
very
boy
he
play
with
,
crowd
as
vividly
before
him
as
if
they
be
scene
of
yesterday
;
and
some
forget
phrase
,
some
childish
word
,
ring
in
his
ear
like
the
echo
of
one
utter
but
a
minute
since
.
 
<EOS>
the
voice
of
the
clergyman
recall
him
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
read
from
the
sacred
book
its
solemn
promise
of
pardon
for
repentance
,
and
its
awful
denunciation
of
obdurate
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
fall
upon
his
knee
and
clasp
his
hand
to
pray
.
 
<EOS>
Hush
!
<EOS>
what
sound
be
that
?
 
<EOS>
He
start
upon
his
foot
.
 
<EOS>
It

<EOS>
Hark

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
six
hour

repentance
for
eight
time
six
year
of
guilt
and
sin

<EOS>
He
bury
his
face
in
his
hand
,
and
throw
himself
on
the
bench
.
   
<EOS>
wear
with
watching
and
excitement
,
he
sleep
,
and
the
same
unsettled
state
of
mind
pursue
him
in
his
dream
.
 
<EOS>
an
insupportable
load
be
take
from
his
breast
;
he
be
walk
with
his
wife
in
a
pleasant
field
,
with
the
bright
sky
above
them
,
and
a
fresh
and
boundless
prospect
on
every
side
---
how
different
from
the
stone
wall
of
Newgate
!
 
<EOS>
She
be
look
---
not
as
she
do
when
he
see
her
for
the
last
time
in
that
dreadful
place
,
but
as
she
use
when
he
love
her
---
long
,
long
ago
,
before
misery
and
ill
-
treatment
have
alter
her
look
,
and
vice
have
change
his
nature
,
and
she
be
lean
upon
his
arm
,
and
look
up
into
his
face
with
tenderness
and
affection
---
and
he
do
not
strike
her
now
,
nor
rudely
shake
her
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
glad
he
be
to
tell
her
all
he
have
forget
in
that
last
hurried
interview
,
and
to
fall
on
his
knee
before
her
and
fervently
beseech
her
pardon
for
all
the
unkindness
and
cruelty
that
waste
her
form
and
break
her
heart
!
 
<EOS>
the
scene
suddenly
change
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
on
his
trial
again
:
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
judge
and
jury
,
and
prosecutor
,
and
witness
,
just
as
they
be
before
.
<EOS>
how
full
the
court
be
---
what
a
sea
of
head
---
with
a
gallow
,
too
,
and
a
scaffold
---
and
how
all
those
people
stare
at
him
!
 
<EOS>
Verdict
,
"
guilty
.
"
 
<EOS>
no
matter
;
he
will
escape
.
   
<EOS>
the
night
be
dark
and
cold
,
the
gate
have
be
leave
open
,
and
in
an
instant
he
be
in
the
street
,
fly
from
the
scene
of
his
imprisonment
like
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
the
street
be
clear
,
the
open
field
be
gain
and
the
broad
,
wide
country
lie
before
him
.
<EOS>
Onward
he
dash
in
the
midst
of
darkness
,
over
hedge
and
ditch
,
through
mud
and
pool
,
bound
from
spot
to
spot
with
a
speed
and
lightness
,
astonish
even
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
he
pause
;
he
must
be
safe
from
pursuit
now
;
he
will
stretch
himself
on
that
bank
and
sleep
till
sunrise
.
   
<EOS>
a
period
of
unconsciousness
succeed
.
 
<EOS>
He
wake
,
cold
and
wretched
.
<EOS>
the
dull
,
gray
light
of
morning
be
steal
into
the
cell
,
and
fall
upon
the
form
of
the
attendant
turnkey
.
 
<EOS>
confuse
by
his
dream
,
he
start
from
his
uneasy
bed
in
momentary
uncertainty
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
but
momentary
.
 
<EOS>
every
object
in
the
narrow
cell
be
too
frightfully
real
to
admit
of
doubt
or
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
the
condemn
felon
again
,
guilty
and
despairing
;
and
in
two
hour
more
will
be
dead
.
    
<EOS>
character
 
thought
about
people
<EOS>
It
be
strange
with
how
little
notice
,
good
,
bad
,
or
indifferent
,
a
man
may
live
and
die
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
He
awaken
no
sympathy
in
the
breast
of
any
single
person
;
his
existence
be
a
matter
of
interest
to
no
one
save
himself
;
he
can
not
be
say
to
be
forget
when
he
die
,
for
no
one
<EOS>
remember
him
when
he
be
alive
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
numerous
class
of
people
in
this
great
metropolis
who
seem
not
to
possess
a
single
friend
,
and
whom
nobody
appear
to
care
for
.
<EOS>
urge
by
imperative
necessity
in
the
first
instance
,
they
have
resort
to
London
in
search
of
employment
,
and
the
mean
of
subsistence
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
hard
,
we
know
,
to
break
the
tie
which
bind
us
to
our
home
and
friend
,
and
hard
still
to
efface
the
thousand
recollection
of
happy
day
and
old
time
,
which
have
be
slumber
in
our
bosom
for
year
,
and
only
rush
upon
the
mind
,
to
bring
before
it
association
connect
with
the
friend
we
have
leave
,
the
scene
we
have
behold
too
probably
for
the
last
time
,
and
the
hope
we
once
cherish
,
but
may
entertain
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
these
man
,
however
,
happily
for
themselves
,
have
long
forget
such
thought
.
<EOS>
old
country
friend
have
die
or
emigrate
;
former
correspondent
have
become
lose
,
like
themselves
,
in
the
crowd
and
turmoil
of
some
busy
city
;
and
they
have
gradually
settle
down
into
mere
passive
creature
of
habit
and
endurance
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
seat
in
the
enclosure
of
St
James
's
Park
the
other
day
,
when
our
attention
be
attract
by
a
man
whom
we
immediately
put
down
in
our
own
mind
as
one
of
this
class
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
tall
,
thin
,
pale
person
,
in
a
black
coat
,
scanty
gray
trouser
,
little
pinch
-
up
gaiter
,
and
brown
beaver
glove
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
an
umbrella
in
his
hand
---
not
for
use
,
for
the
day
be
fine
---
but
,
evidently
,
because
he
always
carry
one
to
the
office
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
He
walk
up
and
down
before
the
little
patch
of
grass
on
which
the
chair
be
place
for
hire
,
not
as
if
he
be
do
it
for
pleasure
or
recreation
,
but
as
if
it
be
a
matter
of
compulsion
,
just
as
he
would
walk
to
the
office
every
morning
from
the
back
settlement
of
Islington
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Monday
;
he
have
escape
for
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
from
the
thraldom
of
the
desk
;
and
be
walk
here
for
exercise
and
amusement
---
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
inclined
to
think
he
have
never
have
a
holiday
before
,
and
that
he
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
himself
.
 
<EOS>
child
be
play
on
the
grass
;
group
of
people
be
loiter
about
,
chat
and
laugh
;
but
the
man
walk
steadily
up
and
down
,
unheeding
and
unheeded
his
spare
,
pale
face
look
as
if
it
be
incapable
of
bear
the
expression
of
curiosity
or
interest
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
the
man
's
manner
and
appearance
which
tell
us
,
we
fancy
,
his
whole
life
,
or
rather
his
whole
day
,
for
a
man
of
this
sort
have
no
variety
of
day
.
 
<EOS>
We
think
we
almost
see
the
dingy
little
back
office
into
which
he
walk
every
morning
,
hang
his
hat
on
the
same
peg
,
and
place
his
leg
beneath
the
same
desk
:
 
first
,
take
off
that
black
coat
which
last
the
year
through
,
and
put
on
the
one
which
do
duty
last
year
,
and
which
he
keep
in
his
desk
to
save
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
there
he
sit
till
five
o'clock
,
work
on
,
all
day
,
as
regularly
as
the
dial
over
the
mantel
-
piece
,
whose
loud
ticking
be
as
monotonous
as
his
whole
existence
:
 
<EOS>
only
raise
his
head
when
some
one
enter
the
counting
-
house
,
or
when
,
in
the
midst
of
some
difficult
calculation
,
he
look
up
to
the
ceiling
as
if
there
be
inspiration
in
the
dusty
skylight
with
a
green
knot
in
the
centre
of
every
pane
of
glass
.
 
<EOS>
about
five
,
or
half
-
past
,
he
slowly
dismount
from
his
accustomed
stool
,
and
again
change
his
coat
,
proceed
to
his
usual
dining
-
place
,
somewhere
near
Bucklersbury
.
<EOS>
the
waiter
recite
the
bill
of
fare
in
a
rather
confidential
manner
---
for
he
be
a
regular
customer
---
and
after
inquire
"
what
be
in
the
good
cut
?
"
<EOS>
and
"
what
be
up
last
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
order
a
small
plate
of
roast
beef
,
with
green
,
and
half
-
a
-
pint
of
porter
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
small
plate
to
-
day
,
because
green
be
a
penny
more
than
potato
,
and
he
have
"
two
bread
"
yesterday
,
with
the
additional
enormity
of
"
a
cheese
"
the
day
before
.
 
<EOS>
this
important
point
settle
,
he
hang
up
his
hat
<EOS>
---
he
take
it
off
the
moment
he
sit
down
---
and
bespeak
the
paper
after
the
next
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
can
get
it
while
he
be
at
dinner
,
he
eat
with
much
great
z
;
balance
it
against
the
water
-
bottle
,
and
eat
a
bit
of
beef
,
and
read
a
line
or
two
,
alternately
.
 
<EOS>
exactly
at
five
minute
before
the
hour
be
up
,
he
produce
a
shilling
,
pay
the
reckoning
,
carefully
deposit
the
change
in
his
waistcoat
-
pocket
(
first
deduct
a
penny
for
the
waiter
)
,
and
return
to
the
office
,
from
which
,
if
it
be
not
foreign
post
night
,
he
again
sallie
forth
,
in
about
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
He
then
walk
home
,
at
his
usual
pace
,
to
his
little
back
room
at
Islington
,
where
he
have
his
tea
;
perhaps
solace
himself
during
the
meal
with
the
conversation
of
his
landlady
's
little
boy
,
whom
he
occasionally
reward
with
a
penny
,
for
solve
problem
in
simple
addition
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
there
be
a
letter
or
two
to
take
up
to
his
employer
's
,
in
Russell
-
square
;
and
then
,
the
wealthy
man
of
business
,
hear
his
voice
,
call
out
from
the
dining
-
parlour
,
---
"
come
in

Mr
Smith
:
"
and
Mr
Smith
,
put
his
hat
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
hall
chair
,
walk
timidly
in
,
and
be
condescendingly
desire
to
sit
down
,
carefully
tuck
his
leg
under
his
chair
,
and
sit
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
table
while
he
drink
the
glass
of
sherry
which
be
pour
out
for
him
by
the
eld
boy
,
and
after
drink
which
,
he
back
and
slide
out
of
the
room
,
in
a
state
of
nervous
agitation
from
which
he
do
not
perfectly
recover
,
until
he
find
himself
once
more
in
the
Islington

road
.
<EOS>
poor
,
harmless
creature
such
man
be
;
contented
but
not
happy
;
break

spirited

humble

they
may
feel
no
pain

but

these

real

miserable

<EOS>
You
may
see
such
man

these

anywhere
;
you
will
know
them
at
coffee

house
by
their
discontent
exclamation

the
luxury
of
their
dinner

at
theatre

by
their
always
sit
in
the

place
and
look
with
a
jaundice
eye
on
all
the
young
people
near
them
;
at
church

by
the
pomposity
with
which
they
enter
,
and
the
loud
tone
in
which
they
repeat
the
response
;
at
party
,
by
their
get
cross
at
whist
and
hate
music

<EOS>
an
old
fellow

kind
will
have
his
chamber
splendidly
furnish

and
collect
book

plate

picture
about
him
in
profusion

not
so

not
the

sometimes
he
will
be
appeal
to
by
a
poor
relation
---
a
married
nephew
perhaps
---
for
some
little
assistance
:
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
will
declaim
with
honest
indignation
on
the
improvidence
of
young
married
people
,
the
worthlessness
of
a
wife
,
the
insolence
of
have
a
family
,
the
atrocity
of
get
into
debt
with
a
hundred
and
twenty
-
five
pound
a
year
,
and
other
unpardonable
crime
;
wind
up
his
exhortation
with
a
complacent
review
of
his

conduct

a
delicate
allusion
to
parochial
relief

He
die

some

of
apoplexy

erect
a

to
his

expressive
of
their
admiration

their
comfortable
conviction

there

They

terrify

They

as

Can
any

have
notice
them
in

and
be
there
ever
such

<EOS>
We
walk
down
the
Strand
,
a
Sunday
or
two
ago
,
behind
a
little
group
;
and
they
furnish
food
for
our
amusement
the
whole
way
.
<EOS>
They
have
come
out
of
some
part
of
the
city
;
it
be
between
three
and
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
;
and
they
be
on
their
way
to
the
Park
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
four
of
them
,
all
arm

with
white

like
so
many
bridegroom
,
light
trouser
of
unprecedented
pattern
,
and
coat
for
which
the
english
language
have
yet
no

---
a
kind
of
cross
between
a
great

coat
and
a
surtout
,
with
the
collar
of
the
one
,
the
skirt
of
the
other

and
pocket
peculiar
to
themselves

<EOS>
each
of
the
gentleman
carry
a
thick
stick
,
with
a
large
tassel
at
the
top
,
which
he
occasionally
twirl
gracefully
round
;
and
the
whole
four
,
by
way
of
look
easy
and
unconcerned
,
be
walk
with
a
paralytic
swagger
irresistibly
ludicrous
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
the
party
have
a
watch
about
the
size
and
shape
of
a
reasonable
Ribstone
pippin
,
jam
into
his
waistcoat

pocket
,
which
he
carefully
compare
with
the
clock
at
St

and
the
New

,
the

clock
at
Exeter
"
Change
,
the
clock
of
St

Church

Horse

<EOS>
when
they
at

arrive
in
St

Park

the

who
have
the

make
boot
on

hire
a
second
chair
expressly
for
his
foot
,
and
fling
himself
on
this
two

pennyworth
of
sylvan
luxury
with
an
air
which
level
all
distinction
between
Brookes

Snooks

Crockford

and
Bagnigge
Wells
.
   
<EOS>
We
may
smile
at
such
people
,
but
they
can
never
excite
our
anger
.
<EOS>
They
be
usually
on
the
good
term
with
themselves
,
and
it
follow
almost
as
a
matter
of
course
,
in
good
humour
with
every
one
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
they
be
always
the
faint
reflection
of
high
light
;
and
,
if
they
do
display
a
little
occasional
foolery
in
their
own
proper
person
,
it
be
surely
more
tolerable
than
precocious
puppyism
in
the
Quadrant
,
whisker
dandyism
in
regent

street
and
pall

,
or
gallantry
in

there

It

the
evening
conclude
with
a
glorious
game
of
blind

in
an
early
stage

<EOS>
grandpapa
take
great

on

when

a
small
sprig
of
mistletoe
from
his
pocket

and
tempt
the
boy
to
kiss
their
little
cousin
under
it
---
a
proceeding
which
afford
both
the
boy
and
the
old
gentleman
unlimited
satisfaction
,
but
which
rather
outrage
grandmamma

idea
of
decorum

until
grandpapa
say

that
when
he
be
just
thirteen
year

three

he
kiss

on
which
the

clap
their

,
and
laugh
very
heartily

as
do
aunt
George
and
uncle
George
;

grandmamma
look
pleased

and
say
,
with
a
benevolent
smile
,
that
grandpapa
be
an
impudent
young
dog

on
which
the

laugh
very
heartily
again

more
heartily
than

when
he
make

derive
some
consolation
from
the
reflection
that
the

enable

go
dream
on
,
until
the
pewter
-
pot
on
the
table
,
or
the
little
beer
-
chiller
on
the
fire
,
have
start
into
life
,
and
address
to
us
a
long
story
of
day
go
by
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
by
some
mean
or
other
,
we
be
not
in
a
romantic
humour
;
and
although
we
try
very
hard
to
invest
the
furniture
with
vitality
,
it
remain
perfectly
unmoved
,
obstinate
,
and
sullen
.
 
<EOS>
be
thus
reduce
to
the
unpleasant
necessity
of
muse
about
ordinary
matter
,
our
thought
revert
to
the
red
-
faced
man
,
and
his
oratorical
display
.
   
<EOS>
a
numerous
race
be
these
red
-
face
man
;
there
be
not
a
parlour
,
or
club
-
room
,
or
benefit
society
,
or
humble
party
of
any
kind
,
without
its
red
-
faced
man
.
 
<EOS>
Weak
-
pat
dolt
they
be
,
and
a
great
deal
of
mischief
they
do
to
their
cause
,
however
good
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
just
to
hold
a
pattern
one
up
,
to
know
the
other
by
,
we
take
his
likeness
at
once
,
and
put
him
in
here
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
be
the
reason
why
we
have
write
this
paper
.
   
<EOS>
the
hospital
patient
in
our
ramble
through
the
street
of
London
<EOS>
after
evening
have
set
in
,
we
often
pause
beneath
the
window
of
some
public
hospital
,
and
picture
to
ourself
the
gloomy
and
mournful
scene
that
be
pass
within
.
 
<EOS>
the
sudden
moving
of
a
taper
as
its
feeble
ray
shoot
from
window
to
window
,
until
its
light
gradually
disappear
,
as
if
it
be
carry
farther
back
into
the
room
to
the
bedside
of
some
suffering
patient
,
be
enough
to
awaken
a
whole
crowd
of
reflection
;
the
mere
glimmering
of
the
low
-
burn
lamp
,
which
,
when
all
other
habitation
be
wrap
in
darkness
and
slumber
,
denote
the
chamber
where
so
many
form
be
writhe
with
pain
,
or
waste
with
disease
,
be
sufficient
to
check
the
most
boisterous
merriment
.
   
<EOS>
who
can
tell
the
anguish
of
those
weary
hour
,
when
the
only
sound
the
sick
man
hear
,
be
the
disjointed
wandering
of
some
feverish
slumberer
near
him
,
the
low
moan
of
pain
,
or
perhaps
the
muttered
,
long
-
forget
prayer
of
a
die
man
?
 
<EOS>
who
,
but
they
who
have
feel
it
,
can
imagine
the
sense
of
loneliness
and
desolation
which
must
be
the
portion
of
those
who
in
the
hour
of
dangerous
illness
be
leave
to
be
tend
by
stranger
;
for
what
hand
,
be
they
ever
so
gentle
,
can
wipe
the
clammy
brow
,
or
smooth
the
restless
bed
,
like
those
of
mother
,
wife
,
or
child
?
   
<EOS>
impressed
with
these
thought
,
we
have
turn
away
,
through
the
nearly
-
desert
street
;
and
the
sight
of
the
few
miserable
creature
still
hover
about
them
,
have
not
tend
to
lessen
the
pain
which
such
meditation
awaken
.
 
<EOS>
the
hospital
be
a
refuge
and
resting
-
place
for
hundred
,
who
but
for
such
institution
must
die
in
the
street
and
doorway
;
but
what
can
be
the
feeling
of
some
outcast
when
they
be
stretch
on
the
bed
of
sickness
with
scarcely
a
hope
of
recovery
?
 
<EOS>
the
wretched
woman
who
linger
about
the
pavement
,
hour
after
midnight
,
and
the
miserable
shadow
of
a
man
---
the
ghastly
remnant
that
want
and
drunkenness
have
leave
---
which
crouch
beneath
a
window
-
ledge
,
to
sleep
where
there
be
some
shelter
from
the
rain
,
have
little
to
bind
them
to
life
,
but
what
have
they
to
look
back
upon
,
in
death
?
 
<EOS>
what
be
the
unwonted
comfort
of
a
roof
and
a
bed
,
to
them
,
when
the
recollection
of
a
whole
life
of
debasement
stalk
before
them
;
when
repentance
seem
a
mockery
,
and
sorrow
come
too
late
?
   
<EOS>
about
a
twelvemonth
ago
,
as
we
be
stroll
through
covent
-
garden
(
we
have
be
think
about
these
thing
over
-
night
)
,
we
be
attract
by
the
very
prepossessing
appearance
of
a
pickpocket
,
who
have
decline
to
take
the
trouble
of
walk
to
the
police
-
office
,
on
the
ground
that
he
have
not
the
slight
wish
to
go
there
at
all
,
be
be
convey
thither
in
a
wheelbarrow
,
to
the
huge
delight
of
a
crowd
.
   
<EOS>
somehow
,
we
never
can
resist
join
a
crowd
,
so
we
turn
back
with
the
mob
,
and
enter
the
office
,
in
company
with
our
friend
the
pickpocket
,
a
couple
of
policeman
,
and
as
many
dirty
-
face
spectator
as
could
squeeze
their
way
in
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
powerful
,
ill
-
look
young
fellow
at
the
bar
,
who
be
undergo
an
examination
,
on
the
very
common
charge
of
have
,
on
the
previous
night
,
ill
-
treat
a
woman
,
with
whom
he
live
in
some
court
hard
by
.
 
<EOS>
several
witness
bear
testimony
to
act
of
the
gross
brutality
;
and
a
certificate
be
read
from
the
house
-
surgeon
of
a
neighbouring
hospital
,
describe
the
nature
of
the
injury
the
woman
have
receive
,
and
intimate
that
her
recovery
be
extremely
doubtful
.
   
<EOS>
some
question
appear
to
have
be
raise
about
the
identity
of
the
prisoner
;
for
when
it
be
agree
that
the
two
magistrate
should
visit
the
hospital
at
eight
o'clock
that
evening
,
to
take
her
deposition
,
it
be
settle
that
the
man
should
be
take
there
also
.
 
<EOS>
He
turn
pale
at
this
,
and
we
see
him
clench
the
bar
very
hard
when
the
order
be
give
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
remove
directly
afterwards
,
and
he
speak
not
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
We
feel
an
irrepressible
curiosity
to
witness
this
interview
,
although
it
be
hard
to
tell
why
,
at
this
instant
,
for
we
know
it
must
be
a
painful
one
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
very
difficult
matter
for
us
to
gain
permission
,
and
we
obtain
it
.
   
<EOS>
the
prisoner
,
and
the
officer
who
have
him
in
custody
,
be
already
at
the
hospital
when
we
reach
it
,
and
wait
the
arrival
of
the
magistrate
in
a
small
room
below
stair
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
be
handcuff
,
and
his
hat
be
pull
forward
over
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
see
,
though
,
by
the
whiteness
of
his
countenance
,
and
the
constant
twitching
of
the
muscle
of
his
face
,
that
he
dread
what
be
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
short
interval
,
the
magistrate
and
clerk
be
bow
in
by
the
house
-
surgeon
and
a
couple
of
young
man
who
smell
very
strong
of
tobacco
-
smoke
---
they
be
introduce
as
"
dresser
"
---
and
after
one
magistrate
have
complain
bitterly
of
the
cold
,
and
the
other
of
the
absence
of
any
news
in
the
evening
paper
,
it
be
announce
that
the
patient
be
prepare
;
and
we
be
conduct
to
the
"
casualty
ward
"
in
which
she
be
lie
.
   
<EOS>
the
dim
light
which
burn
in
the
spacious
room
,
increase
rather
than
diminish
the
ghastly
appearance
of
the
hapless
creature
in
the
bed
,
which
be
range
in
two
long
row
on
either
side
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
bed
,
lie
a
child
envelop
in
bandage
,
with
its
body
half
-
consume
by
fire
;
in
another
,
a
female
,
render
hideous
by
some
dreadful
accident
,
be
wildly
beat
her
clenched
fist
on
the
coverlet
,
in
pain
;
on
a
third
,
there
lie
stretch
a
young
girl
,
apparently
in
the
heavy
stupor
often
the
immediate
precursor
of
death
:
 
<EOS>
her
face
be
stain
with
blood
,
and
her
breast
and
arm
be
bind
up
in
fold
of
linen
.
 
<EOS>
two
or
three
of
the
bed
be
empty
,
and
their
recent
occupant
be
sit
beside
them
,
but
with
face
so
wan
,
and
eye
so
bright
and
glassy
,
that
it
be
fearful
to
meet
their
gaze
.
 
<EOS>
on
every
face
be
stamp
the
expression
of
anguish
and
suffering
.
   
<EOS>
the
object
of
the
visit
be
lie
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
fine
young
woman
of
about
two
or
three
and
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
Her
long
black
hair
,
which
have
be
hastily
cut
from
near
the
wound
on
her
head
,
stream
over
the
pillow
in
jagged
and
matted
lock
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
bear
deep
mark
of
the
ill
-
usage
she
have
receive
:
 
<EOS>
her
hand
be
press
upon
her
side
,
as
if
her
chief
pain
be
there
;
her
breathing
be
short
and
heavy
;
and
it
be
plain
to
see
that
she
be
die
fast
.
 
<EOS>
She
murmur
a
few
word
in
reply
to
the
magistrate
's
inquiry
whether
she
be
in
great
pain
;
and
,
have
be
raise
on
the
pillow
by
the
nurse
,
look
vacantly
upon
the
strange
countenance
that
surround
her
bed
.
 
<EOS>
the
magistrate
nod
to
the
officer
,
to
bring
the
man
forward
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
so
,
and
station
him
at
the
bedside
.
 
<EOS>
the
girl
look
on
with
a
wild
and
troubled
expression
of
face
;
but
her
sight
be
dim
,
and
she
do
not
know
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
take
off
his
hat
,
"
say
the
magistrate
.
 
<EOS>
the
officer
do
as
he
be
desire
,
and
the
man
's
feature
be
disclose
.
   
<EOS>
the
girl
start
up
,
with
an
energy
quite
preternatural
;
the
fire
gleam
in
her
heavy
eye
,
and
the
blood
rush
to
her
pale
and
sunken
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
convulsive
effort
.
 
<EOS>
She
fall
back
upon
her
pillow
,
and
cover
her
scar
and
bruise
face
with
her
hand
,
burst
into
tear
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
cast
an
anxious
look
towards
her
,
but
otherwise
appear
wholly
unmoved
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
brief
pause
the
nature
of
the
errand
be
explain

and
the
oath
tender

<EOS>
"
oh

Her

in
search
of
his

<EOS>
Brute
as
the

<EOS>
He
turn
his

from

and
sob

<EOS>
the

and
her
breathing

more
difficult

<EOS>
She

evidently

"
We

It

She

in
a
broken
whisper

"
I

the

for
a
few
second
,
and
then
draw
the
sheet
over
her

<EOS>
It
cover
a
corpse

<EOS>
the
misplaced
attachment
of
Mr
John
Dounce
<EOS>
if
we
have
to
make
a
classification
of
society
,
there
be
a
particular
kind
of
man
whom
we
should
immediately
set
down
under
the
head
of
"
Old
Boys
;
"
and
a
column
of
most
extensive
dimension
the
old
boy
would
require
.
 
<EOS>
to
what
precise
cause
the
rapid
advance
of
old
-
boy
population
be
to
be
trace
,
we
be
unable
to
determine
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
an
interesting
and
curious
speculation
,
but
,
as
we
have
not
sufficient
space
to
devote
to
it
here
,
we
simply
state
the
fact
that
the
number
of
the
old
boy
have
be
gradually
augment
within
the
last
few
year
,
and
that
they
be
at
this
moment
alarmingly
on
the
increase
.
   
<EOS>
upon
a
general
review
of
the
subject
,
and
without
consider
it
minutely
in
detail
,
we
should
be
dispose
to
subdivide
the
old
boy
into
two
distinct
class
---
the
gay
old
boy
,
and
the
steady
old
boy
.
 
<EOS>
the
gay
old
boy
,
be
paunchy
old
man
in
the
disguise
of
young
one
,
who
frequent
the
Quadrant
and
Regent
-
street
in
the
day
-
time
:
 
the
theatre
(
especially
theatre
under
lady
management
)
at
night
;
and
who
assume
all
the
foppishness
and
levity
of
boy
,
without
the
excuse
of
youth
or
inexperience
.
 
<EOS>
the
steady
old
boy
be
certain
stout
old
gentleman
of
clean
appearance
,
who
be
always
to
be
see
in
the
same
tavern
,
at
the
same
hour
every
evening
,
smoking
and
drinking
in
the
same
company
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
once
a
fine
collection
of
old
boy
to
be
see
round
the
circular
table
at
Offley
's
every
night
,
between
the
hour
of
half

past
eight
and
half
-
past
eleven

<EOS>
We
have
lose
sight
of
them
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
,
and
may
be
still
,
for
aught
we
know
,
two
splendid
specimen
in
full
blossom
at
the
Rainbow
Tavern
in
Fleet

street
,
who
always
use
to
sit
in
the
box
near
the
fireplace
,
and
smoke
long
cherry

pipe
which
go

grand

in
great
state
.
 
<EOS>
everybody
know
them
,
and
it
be
suppose
by
some
people
that
they
be
both
immortal
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
John
Dounce
be
an
old
boy
of
the
latter
class
(
we
do
not
mean
immortal
,
but

when

whenever

bestow
ardent
look
of
intense
devotion
on

on

Mr

Mr

use
to
laugh
very
heartily
,
and
John
Dounce
more
heartily
than
either
of
them
,
acknowledge
,
however
,
that
the
time
have
be
when
he
may
have
do
such
thing
;
upon
which
Mr
Jones
use
to
poke
him
in
the
rib
,
and
tell
him
he
have
be
a
sad
dog
in
his
time
,
which
John
Dounce
with
chuckle
confess
.
 
<EOS>
and
after
Mr
Harris
and
Mr
Jennings
have
prefer
their
claim
to
the
character
of
have
be
sad
dog
too
,
they
separate
harmoniously
,
and
trot
home
.
   
<EOS>
the
decree
of
Fate
,
and
the
mean
by
which
they
be
bring
about
,
be
mysterious
and
inscrutable
.
 
<EOS>
John
Dounce
have
lead
this
life
for
twenty
year
and
upwards
,
without
wish
for
change
,
or
care
for
variety
,
when
his
whole
social
system
be
suddenly
upset
and
turn
completely
topsy
-
turvy
---
not
by
an
earthquake
,
or
some
other
dreadful
convulsion
of
nature
,
as
the
reader
would
be
incline
to
suppose
,
but
by
the
simple
agency
of
an
oyster
;
and
thus
it
happen
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
John
Dounce
be
return
one
night
from
the
Sir
Somebody
's
Head
,
to
his
residence
in
Cursitor
-
street
---
not
tipsy
,
but
rather
excited
,
for
it
be
Mr
Jennings
's
birthday
,
and
they
have
have
a
brace
of
partridge
for
supper
,
and
a
brace
of
extra
glass
afterwards
,
and
Jones
have
be
more
than
ordinarily
amusing
---
when
his
eye
rest
on
a
newly
-
open
oyster
-
shop
,
on
a
magnificent
scale
,
with
native
lay
,
one
deep
,
in
circular
marble
basin
in
the
window
,
together
with
little
round
barrel
of
oyster
direct
to
Lords
and
Baronets
,
and
Colonels
and
Captains
,
in
every
part
of
the
habitable
globe
.
   
<EOS>
behind
the
native
be
the
barrel
,
and
behind
the
barrel
be
a
young
lady
of
about
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
all
in
blue
,
and
all
alone
---
splendid
creature
,
charming
face
and
lovely
figure
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
difficult
to
say
whether
Mr
John
Dounce
's
red
countenance
,
illuminate
as
it
be
by
the
flicker
gas
-
light
in
the
window
before
which
he
pause
,
excite
the
lady
's
risibility
,
or
whether
a
natural
exuberance
of
animal
spirit
prove
too
much
for
that
staidness
of
demeanour
which
the
form
of
society
rather
dictatorially
prescribe
.
 
<EOS>
but
certain
it
be
,
that
the
lady
smile
;
then
put
her
finger
upon
her
lip
,
with
a
striking
recollection
of
what
be
due
to
herself
;
and
finally
retire
,
in
oyster
-
like
bashfulness
,
to
the
very
back
of
the
counter
.
 
<EOS>
the
sad
-
dog
sort
of
feeling
come
strongly
upon
John
Dounce
:
 
<EOS>
he
linger
---
<EOS>
the
lady
in
blue
make
no
sign
.
 
<EOS>
He
cough
---
still
she
come
not
.
 
<EOS>
He
enter
the
shop
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
you
open
me
an
oyster
,
my
dear
?
"
say
Mr
John
Dounce
.
   
<EOS>
"
dare
say
I
can
,
sir
,
"
reply
the
lady
in
blue
,
with
playfulness
.
<EOS>
and
Mr
John
Dounce
eat
one
oyster
,
and
then
look
at
the
young
lady
,
and
then
eat
another
,
and
then
squeeze
the
young
lady
's
hand
as
she
be
open
the
third
,
and
so
forth
,
until
he
have
devour
a
dozen
of
those
at
eightpence
in
less
than
no
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
you
open
me
half
-
a
-
dozen
more
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
Mr
John
Dounce
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
see
what
I
can
do
for
you
,
sir
,
"
reply
the
young
lady
in
blue
,
even
more
bewitchingly
than
before
;
and
Mr
John
Dounce
eat
half
-
a
-
dozen
more
of
those
at
eightpence
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
could
not
manage
to
get
me
a
glass
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
I
suppose
?
"
say
Mr
John
Dounce
,
when
he
have
finish
the
oyster
:
 
in
a
tone
which
clearly
imply
his
supposition
that
she
could
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
see
,
sir
,
"
say
the
young
lady
:
 
<EOS>
and
away
she
run
out
of
the
shop
,
and
down
the
street
,
her
long
auburn
ringlet
shake
in
the
wind
in
the
most
enchanting
manner
;
and
back
she
come
again
,
trip
over
the
coal
-
cellar
lid
like
a
whipping
-
top
,
with
a
tumbler
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
which
Mr
John
Dounce
insist
on
her
take
a
share
of
,
as
it
be
regular
lady
'
grog
---
hot
,
strong
,
sweet
,
and
plenty
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
so
,
the
young
lady
sit
down
with
Mr
John
Dounce
,
in
a
little
red
box
with
a
green
curtain
,
and
take
a
small
sip
of
the
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
and
a
small
look
at
Mr
John
Dounce
,
and
then
turn
her
head
away
,
and
go
through
various
other
serio
-
pantomimic
fascination
,
which
forcibly
remind
Mr
John
Dounce
of
the
first
time
he
court
his
first
wife
,
and
which
make
him
feel
more
affectionate
than
ever
;
in
pursuance
of
which
affection
,
and
actuate
by
which
feeling
,
Mr
John
Dounce
sound
the
young
lady
on
her
matrimonial
engagement
,
when
the
young
lady
deny
have
form
any
such
engagement
at
all
<EOS>
---
she
could
not
abear
the
man
,
they
be
such
deceiver
;
thereupon
Mr
John
Dounce
inquire
whether
this
sweeping
condemnation
be
mean
to
include
other
than
very
young
man
;
on
which
the
young
lady
blush
deeply
---
at
least
she
turn
away
her
head
,
and
say
Mr
John
Dounce
have
make
her
blush
,
so
of
course
she
do
blush
---
and
<EOS>
Mr
John
Dounce
be
a
long
time
drink
the
brandy
-
and
-
water
;
and
,
at
last
,
John
Dounce
go
home
to
bed
,
and
dream
of
his
first
wife
,
and
his
second
wife
,
and
the
young
lady
,
and
partridge
,
and
oyster
,
and
brandy

and

water
,
and
disintereste
attachment

<EOS>
the
next
morning
,
John
Dounce
be
rather
feverish
with
the
extra
brandy

and
-
water
of
the
previous
night
;
and
,
partly
in
the
hope
of
cool
himself
with
an
oyster
,
and
partly
with
the
view
of
ascertain
whether
he
owe
the
young
lady
anything
,
or
not
,
go
back
to
the
oyster

shop
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
young
lady
have
appear
beautiful
by
night
,
she
be
perfectly
irresistible
by
day
;
and
,
from
this
time
forward
,
a
change
come
over
the
spirit
of
John
Dounce
's
dream
.
<EOS>
He
buy
shirt

pin
;
wear
a
ring
on
his
third
finger
;
read
poetry
;
bribe
a
cheap
miniature

painter
to
perpetrate
a
faint
resemblance
to
a
youthful
face
,
with
a
curtain
over
his
head
,
six
large
book
in
the
background
,
and
an
open
country
in
the
distance
<EOS>
(
this
he
call
his
portrait
)
;
"
go
on
"
altogether
in
such
an
uproarious
manner
,
that
the
three
Miss
Dounces
go
off
on
small
pension
,
he
have
make
the
tenement
in
Cursitor

street
too
warm
to
contain
them
;
and
in
short

comport

demean
himself
in
every
respect
like
an
unmitigated
old
Saracen
,
as
he
be
.
   
<EOS>
as

his
ancient
friend
,
the
other
old

,
at
the
Sir
Somebody

,
he
drop
off
from
them
by
gradual
degree
;
for

even
when
he
do
go
there
,
Jones
---
vulgar
fellow
that
Jones

persist
in
ask
"
when
it
be
to
be
?
"
<EOS>
and
"
whether
he
be
to
have
any
glove
?
<EOS>
"
together
with
other
inquiry
of
an
equally
offensive
nature
:
 
<EOS>
at
which
not
only
Harris
laugh

Jennings
also
;
so

he
cut
the
two

attach
himself
solely
to
the
blue
young

at
the
smart

now

to

the

would
reply
in
term
expressive
of
her
entire
concurrence
in
the

and
of
the
virtuous
indignation
with
which
she
reflect
on
the
tyranny
of

"
who
would
not
allow
a

at

that

she

there

such

and
his

such
a
manly

look
young
man

with
such
a
eye

<EOS>
but
even
all
these
be
as
nothing
when
compare
with
his
musical
friend
,
Mr

Mrs
Jennings
Rodolph
,
from
White
Conduit
,
with
whom
the
ornamental
painter
's

have
be
fortunate
enough
to
contract
an
intimacy
while

in
decorate
the

room
of

noble
institution

<EOS>
to
hear
them
sing
separately
,
be
divine
,
but
when
they
go
through
the
tragic
duet
of
"
Red
Ruffian
,
retire
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
it
be
,
as
Miss
Martin
afterwards
remark
,
"
thrill
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
why
(
as
Mr

Rodolph
observe
)
<EOS>
why
be
they
not
engage
at
one
of
the
patent
theatre
?
 
<EOS>
if
he
be
to
be
tell
that
their
voice
be
not
powerful
enough
to
fill
the
House
,
his
only
reply
be
,
that
he
would
back
himself
for
any
amount
to
fill
Russell
-
square
---
a
statement
in
which
the
company
,
after
hear
the
duet
,
express
their
full
belief
;
so
they
all
say
it
be
shameful
treatment
;
and
both
Mr
and
Mrs
Jennings
Rodolph
say
it
be
shameful
too
;
and
Mr
Jennings
Rodolph
look
very
serious
,
and
say
he
know
who
his
malignant
opponent
be
,
but
they
have
better
take
care
how
far
they
go
,
for
if
they
irritate
him
too
much
he
have
not
quite
make
up
his
mind
whether
he
would
not
bring
the
subject
before
Parliament
;
and
they
all
agree
that
it
"
'
ud
serve
'em
quite
right
,
and
it
be
very
proper
that
such
people
should
be
make
an
example
of
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
Mr
Jennings
Rodolph
say
he
would
think
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
conversation
resume
its
former
tone
,
Mr
Jennings
Rodolph
claim
his
right
to
call
upon
a
lady
,
and
the
right
be
concede
,
trust
Miss
Martin
would
favour
the
company
---
a
proposal
which
meet
with
unanimous
approbation
,
whereupon
Miss
Martin
,
after
sundry
hesitating
and
coughing
,
with
a
preparatory
choke
or
two
,
and
an
introductory
declaration
that
she
be
frightened
to
death
to
attempt
it
before
such
great
judge
of
the
art
,
commence
a
species
of
treble
chirruping
contain
frequent
allusion
to
some
young
gentleman
of
the
name
of
Hen
-
e

ry
,
with
an
occasional
reference
to
madness
and
broken
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jennings
Rodolph
frequently
interrupt
the
progress
of
the
song
,
by
ejaculate
"
beautiful

"
---
"
Charming
!
"
---
<EOS>
"
brilliant
!
"
<EOS>
---
"
oh

"
&
c
;
and
at
its
close
the
admiration
of
himself
,
and
his
lady
,
know
no
bound
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
ever
hear
so
sweet
a
voice
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
Mr
Jennings
Rodolph
of
Mrs
Jennings
Rodolph
.
   
<EOS>
"
never
;
indeed
I
never
do
,
love
,
"
reply
Mrs
Jennings
Rodolph
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
think
Miss
Martin
,
with
a
little
cultivation
,
would
be
very
like
Signora
Marra

my

?
"
ask
Mr
Jennings
Rodolph
.
   
<EOS>
"
just
exactly
the
very
thing
that
strike
me
,
my
love

"
answer
Mrs
Jennings
Rodolph
.
   
<EOS>
and
thus
the
time
pass
away
;
Mr
Jennings
Rodolph
play
tune
on
a
walk
-
stick
,
and
then
go
behind
the
parlour
-
door
and
give
his
celebrated
imitation
of
actor
,
edge
-
tool
,
and
animal
;
Miss
Martin
sing
several
other
song
with
increase
admiration
every
time
;
and
even
the
funny
old
gentleman
begin
singe
.
 
<EOS>
His
song
have
properly
seven
verse
,
but
as
he
could
not
recollect
more
than
the
first
one
,
he
sing
that
over
seven
time
,
apparently
very
much
to
his
own
personal
gratification
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
all
the
company
sing
the
national
anthem
with
national
independence
---
each
for
himself
,
without
reference
to
the
other
---
and
finally
separate
:
 
<EOS>
all
declare
that
they
never
have
spend
so
pleasant
an
evening
:
 
and
Miss
Martin
inwardly
resolve
to
adopt
the
advice
of
Mr
Jennings
Rodolph
,
and
to
"
come
out
"
without
delay
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
"
come

in
acting

remarkably
pleasant

manage
to
come
out
with
a
burst
,
and
be
out

to
keep
out

and
not
go
in

but
,
it
do
unfortunately
happen
that
both
consummation
be
extremely
difficult
to
accomplish

and
that
the
difficulty

of

,
out
of
the
five

with
perfect
ease
to
himself

universal

as
several
chivalrous

inquire
rather
pressingly
of
Mr

Cooper
,
whether
he
require
anything
for
his
own
use

or
,
in
other
word

whether

want
anything

"
he
deem
it
prudent
to
make
a
precipitate
retreat

<EOS>
and
the
upshot

that

as

never

<EOS>
shabby
-
genteel
people
<EOS>
there
be
certain
description
of
people
who
,
oddly
enough
,
appear
to
appertain
exclusively
to
the
metropolis
.
 
<EOS>
You
meet
them
,
every
day
,
in
the
street
of
London
,
but
no
one
ever
encounter
them
elsewhere
;
they
seem
indigenous
to
the
soil
,
and
to
belong
as
exclusively
to
London
as
its
own
smoke
,
or
the
dingy
brick
and
mortar
.
 
<EOS>
We
could
illustrate
the
remark
by
a
variety
of
example
,
but
,
in
our
present
sketch
,
we
will
only
advert
to
one
class
as
a
speciman
---
that
class
which
be
so
aptly
and
expressively
designate
as
"
shabby
-
genteel
.
"
   
<EOS>
now
,
shabby
people
,
God
know
,
may
be
find
anywhere
,
and
genteel
people
be
not
article
of
great
scarcity
out
of
London
than
in
it
;
but
this
compound
of
the
two
---
this
shabby
-
gentility
---
be
as
purely
local
as
the
statue
at
char
-
cross
,
or
the
pump
at
Aldgate
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
worthy
of
remark
,
too
,
that
only
man
be
shabby
-
genteel
;
a
woman
be
always
either
dirty
and
slovenly
in
the
extreme
,
or
neat
and
respectable
,
however
poverty
-
stricken
in
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
a
very
poor
man
,
"
who
have
see
well
day
,
"
as
the
phrase
go
,
be
a
strange
compound
of
dirty
-
slovenliness
and
wretched
attempt
at
fade
smartness
.
   
<EOS>
We
will
endeavour
to
explain
our
conception
of
the
term
which
form
the
title
of
this
paper
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
meet
a
man
,
lounge
up
Drury
-
Lane
,
or
lean
with
his
back
against
a
post
in
Long
-
acre
,
with
his
hand
in
the
pocket
of
a
pair
of
drab
trouser
plentifully
besprinkle
with
grease
-
spot
:
 
the
trouser
make
very
full
over
the
boot
,
and
ornament
with
two
cord
down
the
outside
of
each
leg
---
wear
,
also
,
what
have
be
a
brown
coat
with
bright
button
,
and
a
hat
very
much
pinch
up
at
the
side
,
cock
over
his
right
eye
---
do
not
pity
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
shabby
-
genteel
.
 
<EOS>
the
"
harmonic
meeting
"
at
some
fourth
-
rate
public
-
house
,
or
the
purlieu
of
a
private
theatre
,
be
his
choose
haunt
;
he
entertain
a
root
antipathy
to
any
kind
of
work
,
and
be
on
familiar
term
with
several
pantomime
man
at
the
large
house
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
if
you
see
hurry
along
a
by
-
street
,
keep
as
close
as
he
can
to
the
area
-
railing
,
a
man
of
about
forty
or
fifty
,
clothe
in
an
old
rusty
suit
of
threadbare
black
cloth
which
shine
with
constant
wear
as
if
it
have
be
bee
-
wax
---
the
trouser
tightly
strap
down
,
partly
for
the
look
of
the
thing
and
partly
to
keep
his
old
shoe
from
slip
off
at
the
heel
,
---
if
you
observe
,
too
,
that
his
yellowish
-
white
neckerchief
be
carefully
pin
up
,
to
conceal
the
tattere
garment
underneath
,
and
that
his
hand
be
encase
in
the
remain
of
an
old
pair
of
beaver
glove
,
you
may
set
him
down
as
a
shabby
-
genteel
man
.
 
<EOS>
a
glance
at
that
depressed
face
,
and
timorous
air
of
conscious
poverty
,
will
make
your
heart
ache
---
always
suppose
that
you
be
neither
a
philosopher
nor
a
political
economist
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
once
haunt
by
a
shabby
-
genteel
man
;
he
be
bodily
present
to
our
sense
all
day
,
and
he
be
in
our
mind
's
eye
all
night
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
of
whom
Sir
Walter
Scott
speak
in
his
Demonology
,
do
not
suffer
half
the
persecution
from
his
imaginary
gentleman
-
usher
in
black
velvet
,
that
we
sustain
from
our
friend
in
quondam
black
cloth
.
 
<EOS>
He
first
attract
our
notice
,
by
sit
opposite
to
us
in
the
reading
-
room
at
the
British
Museum
;
and
what
make
the
man
more
remarkable
be
,
that
he
always
have
before
him
a
couple
of
shabby
-
genteel
book
---
two
old
dog's
-
eare
folio
,
in
mouldy
worm
-
eat
cover
,
which
have
once
be
smart
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
in
his
chair
,
every
morning
,
just
as
the
clock
strike
ten
;
he
be
always
the
last
to
leave
the
room
in
the
afternoon
;
and
when
he
do
,
he
quit
it
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
know
not
where
else
to
go
,
for
warmth
and
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
there
he
use
to
sit
all
day
,
as
close
to
the
table
as
possible
,
in
order
to
conceal
the
lack
of
button
on
his
coat
:
with
his
old
hat
carefully
deposit
at
his
foot
,
where
he
evidently
flatter
himself
it
escape
observation
.
   
<EOS>
about
two
o'clock
,
you
would
see
him
munch
a
french
roll
or
a
penny
loaf
;
not
take
it
boldly
out
of
his
pocket
at
once
,
like
a
man
who
know
he
be
only
make
a
lunch
;
but
break
off
little
bit
in
his
pocket
,
and
eat
them
by
stealth
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
too
well
it
be
his
dinner
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
first
see
this
poor
object
,
we
think
it
quite
impossible
that
his
attire
could
ever
become
bad
.
 
<EOS>
We
even
go
so
far
,
as
to
speculate
on
the
possibility
of
his
shortly
appear
in
a
decent
second
-
hand
suit
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
nothing
about
the
matter
;
he
grow
more
and
more
shabby
-
genteel
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
the
button
drop
off
his
waistcoat
,
one
by
one
;
then
,
he
button
his
coat
;
and
when
one
side
of
the
coat
be
reduce
to
the
same
condition
as
the
waistcoat
,
he
button
it
over
---
on
the
other
side
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
somewhat
well
at
the
beginning
of
the
week
than
at
the
conclusion
,
because
the
neckerchief
,
though
yellow
,
be
not
quite
so
dingy
;
and
,
in
the
midst
of
all
this
wretchedness
,
he
never
appear
without
glove
and
strap
.
 
<EOS>
He
remain
in
this
state
for
a
week
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
one
of
the
button
on
the
back
of
the
coat
fall
off
,
and
then
the
man
himself
disappear
,
and
we
think
he
be
dead
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
sit
at
the
same
table
about
a
week
after
his
disappearance
,
and
as
our
eye
rest
on
his
vacant
chair
,
we
insensibly
fall
into
a
train
of
meditation
on
the
subject
of
his
retirement
from
public
life
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
wonder
whether
he
have
hang
himself
,
or
throw
himself
off
a
bridge
---
whether
he
really
be
dead
or
have
only
be
arrest
---
when
our
conjecture
be
suddenly
set
at
rest
by
the
entry
of
the
man
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
undergo
some
strange
metamorphosis
,
and
walk
up
the
centre
of
the
room
with
an
air
which
show
he
be
fully
conscious
of
the
improvement
in
his
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
odd
.
 
<EOS>
His
clothe
be
a
fine
,
deep
,
glossy
black
;
and
yet
they
look
like
the
same
suit
;
nay
,
there
be
the
very
darn
with
which
old
acquaintance
have
make
us
familiar
.
 
<EOS>
the
hat
,
too
---
nobody
could
mistake
the
shape
of
that
hat
,
with
its
high
crown
gradually
increase
in
circumference
towards
the
top
.
 
<EOS>
long
service
have
impart
to
it
a
reddish
-
brown
tint
;
but
,
now
,
it
be
as
black
as
the
coat
.
 
<EOS>
the
truth
flash
suddenly
upon
us
---
they
have
be
"
revive
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
deceitful
liquid
that
black
and
blue
reviver
;
we
have
watch
its
effect
on
many
a
shabby
-
genteel
man
.
 
<EOS>
It
betray
its
victim
into
a
temporary
assumption
of
importance
:
 
possibly
into
the
purchase
of
a
new
pair
of
glove
,
or
a
cheap
stock
,
or
some
other
trifling
article
of
dress
.
 
<EOS>
It
elevate
their
spirit
for
a
week
,
only
to
depress
them
,
if
possible
,
below
their
original
level
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
in
this
case
;
the
transient
dignity
of
the
unhappy
man
decrease
,
in
exact
proportion
as
the
"
reviver
"
wear
off
.
 
<EOS>
the
knee
of
the
unmentionable
,
and
the
elbow
of
the
coat
,
and
the
seam
generally
,
soon
begin
to
get
alarmingly
white
.
 
<EOS>
the
hat
be
once
more
deposited
under
the
table
,
and
its
owner
creep
into
his
seat
as
quietly
as
ever
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
week
of
incessant
small
rain
and
mist
.
 
<EOS>
at
its
expiration
the
"
reviver
"
have
entirely
vanish
,
and
the
shabby
-
genteel
man
never
afterwards
attempt
to
effect
any
improvement
in
his
outward
appearance
.
   
<EOS>
It
would
be
difficult
to
name
any
particular
part
of
town
as
the
principal
resort
of
shabby
-
genteel
man
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
meet
a
great
many
person
of
this
description
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
inn
of
court
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
be
meet
with
,
in
Holborn
,
between
eight
and
ten
any
morning
;
and
whoever
have
the
curiosity
to
enter
the
Insolvent
Debtors
'
Court
will
observe
,
both
among
spectator
and
practitioner
,
a
great
variety
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
We
never
go
on
"
Change
,
by
any
chance
,
without
see
some
shabby
-
genteel
man
,
and
we
have
often
wonder
what
earthly
business
they
can
have
there
.
 
<EOS>
They
will
sit
there
,
for
hour
,
lean
on
great
,
dropsical
,
mildew
umbrella
,
or
eat
Abernethy
biscuit
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
speak
to
them
,
nor
they
to
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
on
consideration
,
we
remember
to
have
occasionally
see
two
shabby
-
genteel
man
converse
together
on
"
change
,
but
our
experience
assure
us
that
this
be
an
uncommon
circumstance
,
occasion
by
the
offer
of
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
or
some
such
civility
.
   
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
task
of
equal
difficulty
,
either
to
assign
any
particular
spot
for
the
residence
of
these
being
,
or
to
endeavour
to
enumerate
their
general
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
never
engage
in
business
with
more
than
one
shabby
-
genteel
man
;
and
he
be
a
drunken
engraver
,
and
live
in
a
damp

parlour
in
a
new
row
of
house
at
Camden
-
town
,
half
street
,
half
brick

field
,
somewhere
near
the
canal

<EOS>
a
shabby

may
have
no
occupation

he
may
be
a

He

whether
our

have
notice
these

in

as
often

there

<EOS>
peculiarity

Mr

<EOS>
Mr
Thomas
Potter
and
Mr
Robert
Smithers
meet
by
appointment
to
begin
the
evening
with
a
dinner
;
and
a
nice
,
snug
,
comfortable
dinner
they
have
,
consist
of
a
little
procession
of
four
chop
and
four
kidney
,
follow
each
other
,
support
on

by
a
pot
of

when

,
Mr

order
the
waiter
to
bring
in
,
two
go
of
his
good
Scotch
whiskey
,
with
warm
water
and
sugar
,
and
a
couple
of
his
"
very
mildest
"
havannah
,
which
the
waiter
do
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Thomas
Potter
mix
his
grog
,
and
light
his
cigar
;
Mr
Robert
Smithers
do
the
same
;
and
then
,
Mr
Thomas
Potter
jocularly
propose
as
the
first
toast
,
<EOS>
"
the
abolition
of
all
office
whatever
"
(
not
sinecure
,
but
counting
-
house
)
,
which
be
immediately
drunk
by
Mr
Robert
Smithers
,
with
enthusiastic
applause
.
 
<EOS>
so
they
go
on
,
talk
politic
,
puff
cigar
,
and
sip
whiskey
-
and
-
water
,
until
the
"
go
"
---
most
appropriately
so
called
---
be
both
go
,
which
Mr
Robert
Smithers
perceiving
,
immediately
order
in
two
more
go
of
the
good
Scotch
whiskey
,
and
two
more
of
the
very
mildest
havannah
;
and
the
go
keep
come
in
,
and
the
mild
Havannahs
keep
go
out
,
until
,
what
with
the
drinking
,
and
lighting
,
and
puffing
,
and
the
stale
ashe
on
the
table
,
and
the
tallow
-
grease
on
the
cigar
,
Mr
Robert
Smithers
begin
to
doubt
the
mildness
of
the
Havannahs
,
and
to
feel
very
much
as
if
he
have
be
sit
in
a
hackney
-
coach
with
his
back
to
the
horse
.
   
<EOS>
as
to
Mr
Thomas
Potter
,
he
WOULD
keep
laugh
out
loud
,
and
volunteer
inarticulate
declaration
that
he
be
"
all
right
;
"
in
proof
of
which
,
he
feebly
bespeak
the
evening
paper
after
the
next
gentleman
,
but
find
it
a
matter
of
some
difficulty
to
discover
any
news
in
its
column
,
or
to
ascertain
distinctly
whether
it
have
any
column
at
all
,
walk
slowly
out
to
look
for
the
moon
,
and
,
after
come
back
quite
pale
with
look
up
at
the
sky
so
long
,
and
attempt
to
express
mirth
at
Mr
Robert
Smithers
have
fall
asleep
,
by
various
galvanic
chuckle
,
lay
his
head
on
his
arm
,
and
go
to
sleep
also
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
awake
again
,
Mr
Robert
Smithers
awake
too
,
and
they
both
very
gravely
agree
that
it
be
extremely
unwise
to
eat
so
many
pickle
walnut
with
the
chop
,
as
it
be
a
notorious
fact
that
they
always
make
people
queer
and
sleepy
;
indeed
,
if
it
have
not
be
for
the
whiskey
and
cigar
,
there
be
no
know
what
harm
they
might
not
have
do
'em
.
 
<EOS>
so
they
take
some
coffee
,
and
after
pay
the
bill
,
---
twelve
and
twopence
the
dinner
,
and
the
odd
tenpence
for
the
waiter
---
thirteen
shilling
in
all
---
start
out
on
their
expedition
to
manufacture
a
night
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
just
half
-
past
eight
,
so
they
think
they
could
not
do
better
than
go
at
half
-
price
to
the
slip
at
the
City
Theatre
,
which
they
do
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Robert
Smithers
,
who
have
become
extremely
poetical
after
the
settlement
of
the
bill

the
walk

Mr
Thomas
Potter
in
confidence
that
he
feel
an
inward
presentiment
of
approach
dissolution
,
and
subsequently
embellish
the
theatre
,
by
fall
asleep
with
his
head
and
both
arm
gracefully
droop
over
the
front
of
the
box
.
   
<EOS>
such
be
the
quiet
demeanour
of
the
unassume
Smithers
,
and
such
be
the
happy
effect
of
Scotch
whiskey
and
havannah
on
that
interesting
person
!
 
<EOS>
but

commence

<EOS>
on

We
be
pass
the
corner
of
Bow

street
,
on
our
return
from
a
lounge
excursion
the
other
afternoon
,
when
a
crowd
,
assemble
round
the
door
of
the
Police
-
office
,
attract
our
attention
.
 
<EOS>
We
turn
up
the
street
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
thirty
or
forty
people
,
stand
on
the
pavement
and
half
across
the
road
;
and
a
few
straggler
be
patiently
station
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
---
all
evidently
wait
in
expectation
of
some
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
We
wait
too
,
a
few
minute
,
but
nothing
occur
;
so
,
we
turn
round
to
an
unshorn
,
sallow
-
look
cobbler
,
who
be
stand
next
us
with
his
hand
under
the
bib
of
his
apron

and
put
the
usual
question

"
what
be
the
matter

"
 
<EOS>
the
cobbler
eye
us
from
head
to
foot
,
with
superlative
contempt
,
and
laconically
reply
"
Nuffin

"
   
<EOS>
now
,
we
be
perfectly
aware
that
if
two
man
stop
in
the
street
to
look
at
any
give
object
,
or
even
to
gaze
in
the
air
,
two
hundred
man
will
be
assemble
in
no
time
;
but
,
as
we
know
very
well
that
no
crowd
of
people
could
by
possibility
remain
in
a
street
for
five
minute
without
get
up
a
little
amusement
among
themselves
,
unless
they
have
some
absorb
object
in
view
,
the
natural
inquiry
next
in
order
be
,
"
what
be
all
these
people
wait
here
for
?
"
---
"
Her
Majesty
's
carriage

"
reply
the
cobbler
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
still
more
extraordinary
.
 
<EOS>
We
could
not
imagine
what
earthly
business
Her
Majesty
's
carriage
could
have
at
the
Public
Office
,
Bow
-
street
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
begin
to
ruminate
on
the
possible
cause
of
such
an
uncommon
appearance
,
when
a
general
exclamation
from
all
the
boy
in
the
crowd
of
"
here

<EOS>
cause
us
to
raise
our

be
come
along
at

speed

<EOS>
It
then
occur
to
us
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
Her
Majesty
's
carriage
be
merely
another
name
for
the
prisoner

van
,
confer
upon
it
,
not
only
by
reason
of
the
superior
gentility
of
the
term
,
but
because
the
aforesaid
van
be
maintain
at

expense
:

be
originally

<EOS>
the

draw
up

and
the
people
throng
round
the
step
,
just
leave
a
little
alley
for
the
prisoner

pass
through

<EOS>
Our

<EOS>
that
they

their

They

both

it

I

<EOS>
It
would
require
the
pencil
of
Hogarth
to
illustrate
---
our
feeble
pen
be
inadequate
to
describe
---
the
expression
which
the
countenance
of
Mr
Calton
and
Mr
Septimus
Hicks
respectively
assume
,
at
this
unexpected
announcement
.
 
<EOS>
equally
impossible
be
it
to
describe
,
although
perhaps
it
be
easy
for
our
lady
reader
to
imagine
,
what
art
the
three
lady
could
have
use
,
so
completely
to
entangle
their
separate
partner
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
they
be
,
however
,
they
be
successful
.
 
<EOS>
the
mother
be
perfectly
aware
of
the
intended
marriage
of
both
daughter
;
and
the
young
lady
be
equally
acquaint
with
the
intention
of
their
estimable
parent
.
<EOS>
They
agree
,
however
,
that
it
would
have
a
much
well
appearance
if
each
feign
ignorance
of
the
other
's
engagement
;
and
it
be
equally
desirable
that
all
the
marriage
should
take
place
on
the
same
day
,
to
prevent
the
discovery
of
one
clandestine
alliance
,
operate
prejudicially
on
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
hence
,
the
mystification
of
Mr
Calton
and
Mr
Septimus
Hicks
,
and
the
pre
-
engagement
of
the
unwary
Tibbs
.
   
<EOS>
on

following
morning

holy
alliance

with
Miss
Julia

Tibbs
act
as
father

"
his
first
appearance
in

character

<EOS>
Mr
Calton
,
not
be
quite
so
eager
as
the
two
young
man
,
be
rather
strike
by
the
double
discovery
;
and
as
he
have
find
some
difficulty
in
get
any
one
to
give
the
lady
away
,
it
occur
to
him
that
the
good
mode
of
obviate
the
inconvenience
would
be
not
to
take
her
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
the
lady
,
however
,
"
appeal
,
"
as
her
counsel
say
on
the
trial
of
the
cause

<EOS>
Mr
Septimus
Hicks
have
walk
the

take
it
into
his

to

off
altogether

His

<EOS>
Mr

the
misfortune
to
lose
his

six
week
after
marriage
(
by
her
elope
with
an
officer
during
his
temporary
sojourn
in
the
Fleet
Prison
,
in
consequence
of
his
inability
to
discharge
her
little
mantua
-
maker
's
bill
)
,
and
be
disinherit
by
his
father
,
who
die
soon
afterwards
,
be
fortunate
enough
to
obtain
a
permanent
engagement
at
a
fashionable
haircutter
's
;
hairdresse
be
a
science
to
which
he
have
frequently
direct
his
attention
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
situation
he
have
necessarily
many
opportunity
of
make
himself
acquaint
with
the
habit

and
style

of
the
exclusive
portion

the
nobility

to
this
fortunate

be
we
indebted

It
only
remain
to
add
,
that
this
complication
of
disorder
completely
deprive
poor
Mrs

of
all

Mrs

somewhat
alarming

It

that

flower

pot

turf
before
them
;
the
sea

first

across
the
turf
,
and
among
the
flower

pot
;
and
then
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
;
and
then
Miss
Tuggs
;
and
laughing
,
too
,
quite
boisterously
.
<EOS>
but
as
the
captain
say
,
it
do
not
matter
;
who
know
what
they
be

there
?
 
<EOS>
for
all
the
people
of
the
house
know

they
may
be
common
people

<EOS>
to
which
Mr

respond
,
"
to

"
 
<EOS>
and
then
they
go
down
the
steep
wooden
step
a
little
further
on

the
bottom

finally

one

and
Mr
Cymon
Tuggs
discover
that
the
foot
and
ankle
of
Mrs
Captain
Waters
,
be
even
more
unexceptionable
than
he
have
at
first
suppose
.
   
<EOS>
take
a
donkey
towards
his
ordinary
place
of
residence

be
a
very
different
thing

a
feat
much
more
easily
to

than
take
him
from
it

<EOS>
It
require
a
great
deal
of
foresight
and
presence
of
mind
in
the
one
case
,
to
anticipate
the
numerous
flight
of
his
discursive
imagination
;
whereas
,
in
the
other
,
all
you
have
to
do
,
be
,
to
hold
on
,
and
place
a
blind
confidence
in
the
animal

the

elevated

lay
down

assent

one
winter

evening
,
towards
the
close
of
the
year
1800
,
or
within
a
year
or
two
of
that
time
,
a
young
medical
practitioner
,
recently
establish
in
business
,
be
seat
by
a
cheerful
fire
in
his
little
parlour
,
listen
to
the
wind
which
be
beat
the
rain
in
patter
drop
against
the
window
,
or
rumble
dismally
in
the
chimney
.
 
<EOS>
the
night
be
wet
and
cold
;
he
have
be
walk
through
mud
and
water
the
whole
day
,
and
be
now
comfortably
repose
in
his
dressing

gown
and
slipper
,
more
than
half
asleep
and
less
than
half
awake
,
revolve
a
thousand
matter
in
his
wander
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
first
,
he
think
how
hard
the
wind
be
blow
,
and
how
the
cold
,
sharp
rain
would
be
at
that
moment
beat
in
his
face
,
if
he
be
not
comfortably
house
at

.
 
<EOS>
then
,
his
mind
revert
to
his
annual
Christmas
visit
to
his
native
place
and
dear
friend
;
he
think
how
glad
they
would
all
be
to
see
him
,
and
how
happy
it
would
make
Rose
if
he
could
only
tell
her
that
he
have
find
a
patient
at
last
,
and
hope
to
have
more
,
and
to
come
down
again
,
in
a
few
month
'
time
,
and
marry
her
,
and
take
her
home
to
gladden
his
lonely
fireside
,
and
stimulate
him
to
fresh
exertion
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
he
begin
to
wonder
when
his
first
patient
would
appear
,
or
whether
he
be
destine
,
by
a
special
dispensation
of
Providence
,
never
to
have
any
patient
at
all
;
and
then
,
he
think
about
Rose
again
,
and
drop
to
sleep
and
dream
about
her
,
till
the
tone
of
her
sweet
merry
voice
sound
in
his
ear
,
and
her
soft
tiny
hand
rest
on
his
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
but
it
be
neither
soft
nor
tiny
;
its
owner
be
a
corpulent
round
-
head
boy
,
who
,
in
consideration
of
the
sum
of
one
shill
per
week
and
his
food
,
be
let
out
by
the
parish
to
carry
medicine
and
message
.
 
<EOS>
as
there
be
no
demand
for
the
medicine
,
however
,
and
no
necessity
for
the
message
,
he
usually
occupy
his
unemployed
hour
---

fourteen
a

in
abstract
peppermint
drop
,
take
animal
nourishment

"
cry
our

start
up

with
an
expression
of
alarm
which
the
very
unusual
apparition
of

customer
may
have

to
excite

<EOS>
the

for
an
instant

the
appearance
of
his
unlooked

for
visitor

<EOS>
It
be
a
singularly
tall
woman
,
dress
in
deep
mourning
,
and
stand
so
close
to
the
door
that
her
face
almost
touch
the

<EOS>
the
upper
part
of
her
figure
be
carefully
muffle
in
a
black
shawl
,
as
if
for
the
purpose
of
concealment
;
and
her
face
be
shroud
by
a
thick
black
veil

<EOS>
She
stand
perfectly
erect
,
her
figure
be
draw
up
to
its
full
height
,
and
though
the
surgeon
feel
that
the
eye
beneath
the
veil
be
fix
on
him
,
she
stand
perfectly
motionless
,
and
evince
,
by
no
gesture
<EOS>
whatever
,
the
slight
consciousness
of
his
have
turn
towards
her

<EOS>
"

"
<EOS>
he
inquire
,
with
some
hesitation
,
hold
open
the

<EOS>
It
open
inward

and
therefore
the
action
do
not
alter
the
position
of
the
figure
,
which
still
remain
motionless
on
the

spot

<EOS>
She
slightly
incline
her
head
,
in
token
of
acquiescence
.
   
<EOS>
"
pray
walk
in
,
"

the
surgeon

<EOS>
the
figure
move
a
step
forward
;
and
then
,
turn
its
head
in
the
direction
of
the
boy

to
his
infinite
horror

appear
to
hesitate
.
   
<EOS>
"

the

eye

width

brief
interview

<EOS>
the

draw
a
green
curtain
across
the
glass
part
of
the
door
,
retire
into
the
surgery
,
close
the
door
after
him
,
and
immediately
apply
one
of
his
large
eye
to
the
keyhole
on
the
other
side

<EOS>
the

draw
a
chair
to
the
fire

motion
the
visitor
to
a
seat

<EOS>
the
mysterious
figure
slowly
move
towards
it

<EOS>
as
the
blaze
shine
upon
the
black
dress

the
surgeon
observe
that
the
bottom
of
it

saturate
with
mud

rain

"
You

add
the
surgeon
,
compassionately
,
for
the
tone
be
that
of
a
person
in
pain
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
,
"
be
the
reply

"
very
ill

not
bodily
,

mentally

<EOS>
It
be
not

I
come
to

I

I
should
not

out

alone

at
such
an
hour

on
such
a

this

if
I

afflict

it

twenty
-
four
hour
hence

God
know
how
gladly
I
would
lie
down

pray
to
die

<EOS>
It
be
for
another
that
I
beseech
your
aid

sir

<EOS>
I
may
be
mad
to
ask
it
for
him

I
think
I
be
;

,
night
after
night
,
through
the
long
dreary
hour
of
watching
and
weeping
,
the
thought
have
be
ever
present
to
my
mind
;
and
though
even
I
see
the
hopelessness
of
human
assistance
avail
him
,
the
bare
thought
of
lay
him
in
his
grave
without
it
make
my
blood
run
cold
!

<EOS>
and
a
shudder
,
such
as
the
surgeon
well
know
art
could
not
produce
,
tremble
through
the
speaker

frame

<EOS>
there
be
a
desperate
earnestness

this
woman

manner

<EOS>
that
go
to
the
young

heart

<EOS>
He

and
have
not
yet
witness
enough
of
the
misery
which
be
daily
present
before
the
eye
of
its
member

to
have
grow
comparatively
callous
to
human
suffering

I

go
with
you
instantly

<EOS>
why
do
you
not
obtain
medical
advice
before
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
because
it
would
have
be
useless
before

because
it
be
useless
even
now

"
reply
the
woman
,
clasp
her
hand
passionately
.
   
<EOS>
the
surgeon
gaze
,
for
a
moment
,
on
the
black
veil
,
as
if
to
ascertain
the
expression
of
the
feature
beneath
it
:
 
its
thickness
,
however
,
render
such
a
result
impossible
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
ill

"
he
say
,
gently
,
"
although
you
do
not
know
it

<EOS>
the
fever
which
have
enable
you
to
bear
,
without
feel
it
,
the
fatigue
you
have
evidently
undergo

be
burn
within
you

that
to
your

he
continue
,
pour
out
a
glass
of
water

compose
yourself
for
a
few
moment

as
calmly

what
the

how

<EOS>
the
stranger
lift
the
glass
of
water
to
her
mouth
,
without
raise
the
veil
;
put
it
down
again
untasted
;
and
burst
into
tear
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
"
she
say
,
sob
aloud
,
"
that
what
I
say
to
you
now

seem
like
the
raving
of
fever

<EOS>
I
have
be
tell
so
before

less
kindly
than
by
you

<EOS>
I
be
not
a
young
woman

they
do
say
,
that
as
life
steal
on
towards
its
final
close
,
the
last
short
remnant
,
worthless
as
it
may
seem
to
all
beside
,
be
dearer
to
its
possessor
than
all
the
year
that
have
go
before

connect
though
they
be
with
the
recollection
of
old
friend
long
since
dead

young
one
---
child
perhaps
---
who
have
fall
off
from
,
and
forget
one
as
completely
as
if
they
have
die
too
.
 
<EOS>
My
natural
term
of
life
can
not
be
many
year
longer
,
and
should
be
dear
on
that
account
;
but
I
would
lay
it
down
without
a
sigh

with
cheerfulness

with
joy

if
what
I
tell
you
now

false

I

suddenly

"
I
do
not
say
that
I

reply
the
surgeon
;

but
I
warn
you

that

nine

"
You
must
excuse

the

in

<EOS>
"
He
be
not

be
the
rejoinder

<EOS>
"
then
,
if
I
give
you
instruction

his
treatment
through
the
night

you
could
not

<EOS>
the
woman
weep
bitterly
,
as
she
reply
,
"
I
could
not

"
   
<EOS>
find
that
there
be
but
little
prospect
of
obtain
more
information
by
prolong
the
interview
;

anxious

spare
the

feeling
,
which
,
subdue
at
first
by
a
violent
effort
,
be
now
irrepressible

most
painful
to

;
the
surgeon
repeat
his
promise
of
call
in
the
morning
at
the
appoint
hour

<EOS>
His
visitor

an
obscure
part

Walworth
,
leave
the
house
in
the

mysterious
manner
in
which
she
have
enter
it

<EOS>
It
will
be
readily
believe
that
so
extraordinary
a
visit
produce
a
considerable
impression
on
the
mind
of
the
young
surgeon
;
and
that
he
speculate
a
great
deal
and
to
very
little
purpose
on
the
possible
circumstance
of
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
in
common
with
the
generality
of
people
,
he
have
often
hear
and
read
of
singular
instance
,
in
which
a
presentiment
of
death

at
a
particular
day
,

even
minute
,
have
be
entertain
and
realise
.
 
<EOS>
at
one
moment
he
be
inclined
to
think
that
the
present
may
be
such
a
case
;
but
,
then
,
it
occur
to
him
that
all
the
anecdote
of
the
kind
he
have
ever
hear
,
be
of
person
who
have
be
trouble
with
a
foreboding
of
their
own
death
.
 
<EOS>
this
woman
,
however
,
speak
of
another
person
---
a
man
;
and
it
be
impossible
to
suppose
that
a
mere
dream
or
delusion
of
fancy
would
induce
her
to
speak
of
his
approach
dissolution
with
such
terrible
certainty
as
she
have
speak
.
 
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
that
the
man
be
to
be
murder
in
the
morning
,
and
that
the
woman
,
originally
a
consent
party
,
and
bind
to
secrecy
by
an
oath
,
have
relent
,
and
,
though
unable
to
prevent
the
commission
of
some
outrage
on
the
victim
,
have
determine
to
prevent
his
death
if
possible
,
by
the
timely
interposition
of
medical
aid
?
 
<EOS>
the
idea
of
such
thing
happen
within
two
mile
of
the
metropolis
appear
too
wild
and
preposterous
to
be
entertain
beyond
the
instant
.
<EOS>
then
,
his
original
impression
that
the
woman
's
intellect
be
disorder
,
recur
;
and
,
as
it
be
the
only
mode
of
solve
the
difficulty
with
any
degree
of
satisfaction
,
he
obstinately
make
up
his
mind
to
believe
that
she
be
mad
.
 
<EOS>
certain
misgiving
upon
this
point
,
however
,
steal
upon
his
thought
at
the
time
,
and
present
themselves
again
and
again
through
the
long
dull
course
of
a
sleepless
night
;
during
which
,
in
spite
of
all
his
effort
to
the
contrary
,
he
be
unable
to
banish
the
black
veil
from
his
disturbed
imagination
.
   
<EOS>
the
back
part
of
Walworth
,
at
its
great
distance
from
town
,
be
a
straggle
miserable
place
enough
,
even
in
these

but
,
five

thirty
year
ago
,
the
great
portion
of
it

little
well
than
a
dreary

inhabit
by
a
few
scatter
people
of
questionable
character
,
whose
poverty
prevent
their
living
in
any
well
neighbourhood

or
whose
pursuit
and

desirable

<EOS>
very
many
of
the
house
which
have
since

be
not

until
some
year
afterwards
;
and
the
great
majority
even
of
those
which
be
sprinkle
about
,
at
irregular
interval
,
be
of
the
rude
and
most
miserable
description
.
   
<EOS>
the
appearance
of
the
place
through
which
he
walk
in
the
morning
,
be
not
calculate
to
raise
the
spirit
of
the
young
surgeon
,
or
to
dispel
any
feeling
of
anxiety
or
depression
which
the
singular
kind
of
visit
<EOS>
he
be
about
to
make
,
have
awaken
.
 
<EOS>
strike
off
from
the
high
road
,
his
way
lie
across
a
marshy
common
,
through
irregular
lane
,
with
here
and
there
a
ruinous
and
dismantled
cottage
fast
fall
to
piece
with
decay
and
neglect

or
pool
of
stagnant
water

a
sluggish
action
by
the
heavy
rain
of
the
precede
night

the
path
occasionally
;
and
,
now
and
then
,
a
miserable
patch
of
garden
-
ground
,
with
a
few
old
board
knock
together
for
a
summer
-
house
,
and
old
paling
imperfectly
mend
with
stake
pilfer
from
the
neighbouring
hedge
,
bore
testimony
,
at
once
to
the
poverty
of
the
inhabitant
,
and
the
little
scruple
they
entertain
in
appropriate
the
property
of
other
people
to
their
own
use
.
 
<EOS>
occasionally
,
a
filthy

look
woman
would
make
her
appearance
from
the
door
of
a
dirty
house
,
to
empty
the
content
of
some
cooking
utensil
into
the
gutter
in
front
,
or
to
scream
after
a
little
slip
-
shod
girl
,
who
have
contrive
to
stagger
a
few
yard
from
the
door
under
the
weight
of
a
sallow
infant
almost
as
big
as
herself
;
but
,
scarcely
anything
be
stir
around
:
 
and
so
much
of
the
prospect
as
could
be
faintly
trace
through
the
cold
damp
mist
which
hang
heavily
over
it
,
present
a
lonely
and
dreary
appearance
perfectly
in
keep
with
the
object
we
have
describe
.
   
<EOS>
after
plod
wearily
through
the
mud
and
mire
;
make
many
inquiry
for
the
place
to
which
he
have
be
direct
;
and
receive
as
many
contradictory
and
unsatisfactory
reply
in
return
;
the
young
man
at
length
arrive
before
the
house
which
have
be
point
out
to
him
as
the
object
of
his
destination
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
small
low
building
,
one
story
above
the
ground
,
with
even
a
more
desolate
and
unpromising
exterior
than
any
he
have
yet
pass
.
 
<EOS>
an
old
yellow
curtain
be
closely
draw
across
the
window
up
-
stair
,
and
the
parlour
shutter
be
closed
,
but
not

<EOS>
the
house
be
detach
from
any
other
,
and
,
as
it
stand
at
an
angle
of
a
narrow
lane
,
there
be
no
other
habitation
in
sight
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
say
that
the
surgeon
hesitate
,
and
walk
a
few
pace
beyond
the
house
,
before
he
could
prevail
upon
himself
to
lift
the
knocker
,
we
say
nothing
that
need
raise
a
smile
upon
the
face
of
the
bold
reader
.
 
<EOS>
the
police
of
London
be
a
very
different
body
in
that
day
;
the
isolate
position
of
the
suburb
,
when
the
rage
for
building
and
the
progress
of
improvement
have
not
yet
begin
to
connect
them
with
the
main
body
of
the
city
and
its
environ
,
render
many
of
them
(
and
this
in
particular
)
<EOS>
a
place
of
resort
for
the
bad
and
most
depraved
character
.
 
<EOS>
even
the
street
in
the
gay
part
of
London
be
imperfectly
light
,
at
that
time
;
and
such
place
as
these
,
be
leave
entirely
to
the
mercy
of
the
moon
and
star
.
 
<EOS>
the
chance
of
detect
desperate
character
,
or
of
trace
them
to
their
haunt
,
be
thus
render
very
few
,
and
their
offence
naturally
increase
in
boldness
,
as
the
consciousness
of
comparative
security
become
the
more
impressed
upon
them
by
daily
experience
.
 
<EOS>
add
to
these
consideration
,
it
must
be
remember
that
the
young
man
have
spend
some
time
in
the
public
hospital
of
the
metropolis
;
and
,
although
neither
Burke
nor
Bishop
have
then
gain
a
horrible
notoriety
,
his
own
observation
may
have
suggest
to
him
how
easily
the
atrocity
to
which
the
former
have
since
give
his
name
,
may
be
commit
.
 
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
may
,
whatever
reflection
make
him
hesitate
,
he
do
hesitate
:
 
but
,
be
a
young
man
of
strong
mind
and
great
personal
courage
,
it
be
only
for
an
instant
;

he
step
briskly
back
and
knock
gently
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
a
low
whispering
be
audible
,
immediately
afterwards
,
as
if
some
person
at
the
end
of
the
passage
be
converse
stealthily
with
another
on
the
landing
above
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
succeed
by
the
noise
of
a
pair
of
heavy
boot
upon
the
bare
floor

<EOS>
the

softly
unfastened

with
black
hair
,
and
a
face
,
as
the
surgeon
often
declare
afterwards
,
as
pale
and
haggard
,
as
the
countenance
of
any
dead
man
he
ever

present
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"

he

in

the

so

secure
the

again
,
by

chain
,
lead

at

<EOS>
"

the
man

<EOS>
the
surgeon
turn
hastily
round
,
with
a
gesture
of
astonishment
not
unmixed
with
alarm
,
which
he
find
it
impossible
to
repress
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
step
in
here
,
sir

"
say
the
man

who

you

the

<EOS>
the

close
the
door
,
and

It

<EOS>
not

either
within

<EOS>
the
young
surgeon
sit
down
by
the
fireplace
,
to
await
the
result
of
his
first
professional
visit

<EOS>
He
have
not

in
this
position
many
minute

when
the
noise
of
some
approach
vehicle
strike
his
ear

<EOS>
It
stop
;
the
street

a
low
talking

,
accompany
with
a
shuffling
noise
of
footstep

along

<EOS>
another

resolve
to
explore
the

in
search
of
some
one
to

the
singular
height

child
to
a
remote
part

Miss

<EOS>
one
of
those
hum

which
one
frequently
hear
in
society

when
nobody
have
the
most
distant

his
approval

<EOS>
the
three
Misses

look
modestly
at

mamma
,
and
the
mamma
look
approvingly
at
her
daughter
,
and
Mrs
Taunton
look
scornfully
at
all
of
them

<EOS>
the
Misses
Briggs
ask
for
their
guitar
,
and
several
gentleman
seriously
damage
the
case
in
their
anxiety
to
present
them

<EOS>
then
,
there
be
a
very
interesting

during
which
Mrs
Briggs
expatiate
to
those
near
her
on
the
immense
difficulty
of
play
a
guitar
,
and
hint
at
the
wondrous
proficiency
of
her
daughter
in
that
mystic
art
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Taunton
whisper
to
a
neighbour
that
it

and
the
Misses
Taunton
look
as
if
they
know
how
to
play
,
but
disdain
to
do
it

<EOS>
at
length

the
Misses

It

the

have
by
this
time
reach
their
destination

put
about

<EOS>
the
wind

with
them
the
whole
day

be
now
directly
in
their
tooth

the
weather

become
gradually
more

more
overcast

hour

the

the
waterman
at
the
wheel
have
unequivocally
express
his
opinion
that
there
would
shortly
be
a
squall

<EOS>
a
slight
emotion
on
the
part
of
the
vessel
,
now
and
then
,
seem
to
suggest
the
possibility
of
its
pitching
to
a
very
uncomfortable
extent
in
the
event
of
its
blowing
harder
;
and
every
timber
begin

Hardy

sincerely
wish
that
he
could
persuade
himself
that
it

not

for
he
sit
near

almost
blow
off

be
now
pretty
well
engross
by
the
serious
business
of
eating
,
carve
,
take
wine
,
and
so
forth
.
   
<EOS>
the
throb
motion
of
the
engine
be
but
too
perceptible
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
large
,
substantial
,
cold
boil
leg
of
mutton
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
,
shake
like
blancmange
;
a
previously
hearty
sirloin
of
beef
look
as
if
it
have
be
suddenly
seize
with
the
palsy

and
some
tongue
,
which
be
place
on
dish
rather
too
large
for
them
,
go
through
the
most
surprising
evolution
;
dart
from
side
to
side
,
and
from
end
to
end
,
like
a
fly
in
an
invert
wine

glass
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
the
sweet
shake
and
tremble
,
till
it
be
quite
impossible
to
help
them
,
and
people
give
up
the
attempt
in
despair
;
and
the
pigeon

pie
look
as
if
the
bird
,
whose
leg
be
stick
outside

be
try
to
get
them
in

<EOS>
the
table
vibrate
and
start
like
a
feverish
pulse
,
and
the
very
leg
be
convulse
---
everything
be
shake
and
jar
.
 
<EOS>
the
beam
in
the
roof
of
the
cabin
seem
as
if
they
be
put
there
for
the
sole
purpose
of
give
people
head

ache
,

several
elderly
gentleman
become
ill

temper
in
consequence

as
fast

it

he
remember
all
the
principal
play
of

from
begin

so
he
do

<EOS>
the
result

this
parrot

that

Mr

which

remarkably
difficult

extricate
himself

It

a
man

it

one
plunge

all
be
over

They

unfortunate
victim

as
much
comfort
from

assurance
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other

<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
be
a
rather
uncommon
compound
of
strong
uxorious
inclination

unparalleled
degree
of
anti

connubial
timidity

age

He

one

novel

have
a
clean

cravatish
formality
of
manner

pokerness

Sir

himself
may
have
envy

He

rather
small

He
receive
it

Monday

but
he
run
himself
out
,
about
a
day
after
the
expiration
of
the
first
week
,
as
regularly

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
and
he
rub
the
palm

as
hard
as

<EOS>
"
what
will

"
<EOS>
inquire
Tottle
,
with
the
desperate
suddenness
of
a
man
who

he
stand
very
little
chance
of

it

<EOS>
when
Mr

Gabriel

perhaps
I

I
know
the

black

I
can
not

quite
positively
about

unless
one
walk
behind
her

and
catch
a
glimpse
of
it
under
her
bonnet
,
one
seldom
see
it

I
should
say
that
it
be
rather
light

the

a
shade
of
a
greyish
tinge

perhaps
.

<EOS>
Mr
Watkins
Tottle
look
as
if

certain
misgiving

Mr

it

it

up

down

exhibit
a
most
extensive
combination
of
colour
as
he
confess
the
soft
impeachment

<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
pop
the
question

more
than
once

your

a

man

never

indignant

be
suspect

such
an

never
!
 
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
that
I
entertain
,
as
you
know

peculiar
opinion
on
these
subject

<EOS>
I
be
not
afraid
of
lady
,
young

old

far
from
it
;
but
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
that
in
compliance
with
the
custom
of
the
present
day
,
they
allow
too
much
freedom
of
speech
and
manner
to
marriageable
man

<EOS>
now
,
the
fact
be
,
that
anything
like
this
easy
freedom
I
never
could
acquire
;
and
as
I
be
always
afraid
of
go
too
far
,
I
be
generally
,
I
dare
say
,
consider
formal
and
cold
.

<EOS>
"
I
should
not

you

gravely
;
"
I
should
not
wonder

<EOS>
however
,
you
will
be
all
right
in
this
case
;
for
the
strictness
and
delicacy
of
this
lady
's
idea
greatly
exceed
your
own
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
bless
you
,
why
,
when
she
come
to
our
house

there
be
an
old
portrait
of
some

with
two
large

black

up

it

take
down

it
decidedly
wrong

"
   
<EOS>
"
I

so

too
,
"

Mr
Watkins
Tottle
;
"
certainly
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
the
other
night

I
never

so
much
in

resume
Mr

Parsons
;

I
have
drive
home

I
should
wrap
my

flannel
petticoat

She
instantly
throw
up

quite

a

<EOS>
next
morning
at
breakfast

we
talk
it
over

She
contend
that

Tottle

deeply
interested

change
her
ground

that

obvious

gleam

placid
satisfaction
shine
on

face
of
Mr

one
thing
I

the

certainly
go
into
convulsion

"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons
sit
down
again

laugh
until
he
be
weak

<EOS>
Tottle
owe
him
money
,
so
he
have
a

dine
with

with
great
firmness

Mr

listen
attentively

pick
up
some
suggestion

may
be
useful

him
in
his
new
undertaking

<EOS>
"
I
spend
my

night

chimney

by
way

a
beginning

in

"
how
dreadful
!

<EOS>
"
yes
,
it
be
not
very
pleasant

"
reply
the
small
host

<EOS>
"
the
fact
be
,
Fanny
's
father
and
mother
like
me
well
enough
as
an
individual
,
but
have
a
decide
objection
to
my
become
a
husband
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
I
have
not
any
money
in
those
day
,
and
they
have
;
and
so
they
want
Fanny
to
pick
up
somebody
else
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
we
manage
to
discover
the
state
of
each
other
's
affection
somehow
.
 
<EOS>
I
use
to
meet
her
,
at
some
mutual
friend
'
party
;
at
first
we
dance
together
,
and
talk
,
and
flirt
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
;
then
,
I
use
to
like
nothing
so
well
as
sit
by
her
side
---
we
do
not
talk
so
much
then
,
but
I
remember
I
use
to
have
a
great
notion
of
look
at
her
out
of
the
extreme
corner
of
my
left
eye
---
and
then
I
get
very
miserable
and
sentimental
,
and
begin
to
write
verse
,
and
use
Macassar
oil
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
could
not
bear
it
any
longer
,
and
after
I
have
walk
up
and
down
the
sunny
side
of
Oxford
-
street
in
tight
boot
for
a
week
---
and
a
devilish
hot
summer
<EOS>
it
be
too

<EOS>
in
the
hope
of
meet
her
,
I
sit
down
and
write
a
letter
,
and
beg
her
to
manage
to
see
me
clandestinely
,
for
I
want
to
hear
her
decision
from
her
own
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
I
have
discover
,
to
my
perfect
satisfaction
,
that
I
could
not
live
without
her
,
and
that
if
she
do
not
have
me
,
I
have
make
up
my
mind
to
take
prussic
acid
,

take
to
drinking
,

emigrate
,
so
as
to
take
myself
off

some
way

other

<EOS>
well
,
I
borrow
a
pound
,

bribe
the

to
give
her
the
note
,
which
she
do
.

what
be
the

"
<EOS>
inquire
Timson

who
have
find
,
before

that
to

"
<EOS>
oh

the
usual
one

<EOS>
Fanny
express
herself
very
miserable

hint
at
the

an
early
grave

say
that
nothing
should
induce
her
to
swerve
from
the
duty
she
owe
her
parent

implore
me
to
forget
her

find
out
somebody
more
deserving

all
that
sort
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
she
could
,
on
no
account
,
think
of
meet
me
unknown
to
her
pa
and
ma
;
and
entreat
me
,
as
she
should
be
in
a
particular
part
of
Kensington
Gardens
at
eleven
o'clock
next
morning
,
not

meet
her
there

You

<EOS>
of

there
she
be

with
the
identical
housemaid
in
perspective

in
order
that
there
may
be
no
interruption

<EOS>
We
walk
about
,
for
a
couple
of
hour
;
make
ourselves
delightfully
miserable

be
regularly
engage

<EOS>
then
,
we
begin
to
"
correspond
"
---
that
be
to

we
use

exchange
about
four
letter
a
day
;
what
we
use

in
'em
<EOS>
I
can
not

I
use

some

every
evening

thing
go
on

at

be
pathetic

She
be

fall
at
the

<EOS>
My

my

day
in
stroll
about
Hampstead

<EOS>
of

,
I

little
wife
at

,
as
much
as
I
could

with
the
assurance
that
our

would
soon
be
over

<EOS>
I

of
which
I
have
a
key

and
be

by
the

with
a
stone

floor
and
a

:
 
upon
which
,
in
the

we

you
would
be
devilish
glad
to

yourself
of
such
an
opportunity

<EOS>
however
,
let
me
see
;
---
where
be
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
on
the
dresser
,
"
suggest
Timson
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
---
ah
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
here
I
find
poor
Fanny
,
quite
disconsolate
and
uncomfortable
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
boy
have
be
very
cross
all
day
,
which
make
her
feel
still
more
lonely
;
and
she
be
quite
out
of
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
I
put
a
good
face
on
the
matter
,
and
laugh
it
off
,
and
say
we
should
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
a
matrimonial
life
more
by
contrast
;
and
,
at
length
,
poor
Fanny
brighten
up
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
I
stop
there
,
till
about
eleven
o'clock
,
and
,
just
as
I
be
take
my
leave
for
the
fourteenth
time
,
the
girl
come
run
down
the
stair
,
without
her
shoe
,
in
a
great
fright
,
to
tell
us
that
the
old
villain
---
Heaven
forgive
me
for
call
him
so
,
for
he
be
dead
and
go
now
!
---
<EOS>
prompt
I
suppose
by
the
prince
of
darkness
,
be
come
down
,
to
draw
his
own
beer
for
supper
---
a
thing
he
have
not
do
before
,
for
six
month
,
to
my
certain
knowledge
;
for
the
cask
stand
in
that
very
back
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
discover
me
there
,
explanation
would
have
be
out
of
the
question
;
for
he
be
so
outrageously
violent
,
when
at
all
excited
,
that
he
never
would
have
listen
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
only
one
thing
to
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
the
chimney
be
a
very
wide
one
;
it
have
be
originally
build
for
an
oven
;
go
up
perpendicularly
for
a
few
foot
,
and
then
shoot
backward
and
form
a
sort
of
small
cavern
.
 
<EOS>
My
hope
and
fortune
---
the
mean
of
our
joint
existence
almost
---
be
at
stake
.
 
<EOS>
I
scramble
in
like
a
squirrel
;
coil
myself
up
in
this
recess
;
and
,
as
Fanny
and
the
girl
replace
the
deal
chimney
-
board
,
I
could
see
the
light
of
the
candle
which
my
unconscious
father
-
in
-
law
carry
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
him
draw
the
beer
;
and
I
never
hear
beer
run
so
slowly
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
just
leave
the
kitchen
,
and
I
be
prepare
to
descend
,
when
down
come
the
infernal
chimney
-
board
with
a
tremendous
crash
.
 
<EOS>
He
stop
and
put
down
the
candle
and
the
jug
of
beer
on
the
dresser
;
he
be
a
nervous
old
fellow
,
and
any
unexpected
noise
annoy
him
.
<EOS>
He
coolly
observe
that
the
fire
-
place
be
never
use
,
and
send
the
frightened
servant
into
the
next
kitchen
for
a
hammer
and
nail
,
actually
nail
up
the
board
,
and
lock
the
door
on
the
outside
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
there
be
I
,
on
my
wedding
-
night
,
in
the
light
kerseymere
trouser
,
fancy
waistcoat
,
and
blue
coat
,
that
I
have
be
marry
in
in
the
morning
,
in
a
back

kitchen
chimney
,
the
bottom
of
which
be
nail
up
,
and
the
top
of
which
have
be
formerly
raise
some
fifteen
foot
,
to
prevent
the
smoke
from
annoy
the
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
and
there
,
"
add
Mr
Gabriel
Parsons

as
he
pass
the
bottle
,
"
there
<EOS>
I
remain
till
half
-
past
seven
<EOS>
the
next
morning
,
when
the
housemaid
's
sweetheart
,
who
be
a
carpenter
,
unshelle
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
dog
have
nail
me
up
so
securely
,
that
,
to
this
very
hour
,
I
firmly
believe
that
no
one
but
a
carpenter
could
ever
have
get
me
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
and
what
do
Mrs

say
,
when
he
find
you
be
married
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
Watkins
Tottle
,
who
,
although
he
never
see
a
joke
,
be
not
satisfied
until
he
hear
a
story
to
the
very
end
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
the
affair
of
the
chimney
so
tickle
his
fancy
,
that
he
pardon
us
off

hand
,
and
allow
us
something
to
live
on
till
he
go
the
way
of
all
flesh
.
 
<EOS>
I
spend
the
next
night
in
his
second

,
much
more
comfortably
than
I
have

this
here
young
gen'lm'n
's
father
<EOS>
---
so
I
be
tell
,
mind
ye
---
and
the
father
o
'
<EOS>
the
young
voman
,
have
always
be
on
very
bad
,
out
-
and
-
out
,
rig'lar
knock
-
me
-
down
sort
o
'
term
;
but
somehow
or
another
,
when
he
be
a
wisitin
'
at
some
gentlefolk
's
house
,
as
he
know
at
college
,
he
come
into
contract
with
the
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
He
seed
her
several
time
,
and
then
he
up
and
say
he
would
keep
company
with
her
,
if
so
be
as
she
vos
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
Vell
,
she
vos
as
sweet
upon
him
as
he
vos
upon
her
,
and
so
I
s'pose
<EOS>
they
make
it
all
right
;
for
they
get
marry
about
six
month
arterward
,
unbeknown
,
mind
ye
,
to
the
two
father
<EOS>
---
leastway
<EOS>
so
I
be
tell
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
hear
on
it
---
my
eye
,
there
be
such
a
combustion
!
 
<EOS>
starvation
vos
the
very
least
that
vos
to
be
do
to
'em
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
gen'lm'n
's
father
cut
him
off
vith
a
bob
,
because
he
would
cut
himself
off
vith
a
wife
;
and
the
young
lady
's
father
<EOS>
he
behave
even
worse
and
more
unnat'ral
,
for
he
not
only
<EOS>
blow'd
her
up
dreadful
,
and
swear
<EOS>
he
would
never
see
her
again
,
but
he
employ
a
chap
as
I
know
---
and
as
you
know
,
Mr
Valker
,
a
precious
sight
too
well
---
to
go
about
and
buy
up
the
bill
and
them
thing
on
which
the
young
husband
,
think
his
governor
'
ud
come
round
agin
,
have
raise
the
vind
just
to
blow
himself
on
vith
for
a
time
;
besides
vich
,
he
make
all
the
interest
he
could
to
set
other
people
agin
him
.
 
<EOS>
Consequence
vos
,
that
he
pay
as
long
as
he
could
;
but
thing
he
never
expect
to
have
to
meet
<EOS>
till
he
would
have
time
to
turn
himself
round
,
come
fast
upon
him
,
and
he
vos
nab
.
 
<EOS>
He
vos
bring
here
,
as
I
say
afore
,
last
Vensday

I

there
be
about

<EOS>
"
He
be
game
enough
<EOS>
ven
there
be
anything

,
Mr
Walker
,
with
a
pale
young
creetur
like

It

drive
any

into
his

to
see
'em
together

and
no

Mr

Parsons
walk
up

down
the

for
a
few
second

before

could
make
up
his
mind
to
disclose
the
plan
he
have
form
;
he
be
accustomed
to
drive
hard
bargain

be
always
most
anxious

conceal
his
avarice

<EOS>
at
length

you

me
fifty

<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>

and
from
all
I

I
infer
that
you
be
likely

I
fear
I
be

<EOS>
"
at

It
be
for

what

enamoured
Watkins

<EOS>
"
why
,
"
reply
parson
,
"
to
say
exactly
what
she
have
confess
,
would
be
rather
difficult

because
they
only
speak
in
hint

so
forth
;
but
my
wife
,
who
be
no
bad
judge
in
these
case

declare
to
me
that
what
she
have
confess

as
good
as

not
insensible
of
your
merit

in
fact
,
that
no
other
man
should
have
her

<EOS>
dear
UNCLE
,
---
You
will
be
delighted
to
hear
that
my
dear
Jemima
have
leave
her
room
,
and
that
your
future
godson
be
get
on
capitally
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
thin
at
first
,
but
he
be
get
much
large
,
and
nurse
say
he
be
fill
out
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
cry
a
good
deal
,
and
be
a
very
singular
colour
,
which
make
Jemima
and
me
rather
uncomfortable
;
but
as
nurse
say
it
be
natural
,
and
as
of
course
we
know
nothing
about
these
thing
yet
,
we
be
quite
satisfied
with
what
nurse
say
.
 
<EOS>
We
think
he
will
be
a
sharp
child
;
and
nurse
say
she
be
sure
he
will
,
because
he
never
go
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
readily
believe
that
we
be
all
very
happy
,
only
we
be
a
little
wear
out
for
want
of
rest
,
as
he
keep
us
awake
all
night
;
but
this
we
must
expect
,
nurse
say
,
for
the
first
six
or
eight
month
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
vaccinate
,
but
in
consequence
of
the
operation
be
rather
awkwardly
perform
,
some
small
particle
of
glass
be
introduce
into
the
arm
with
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
this
may
in
some
degree
account
for
his
be
rather
fractious
;
at
least
,
so
nurse
say
.
 
<EOS>
We
propose
to
have
him
christen
at
twelve
o'clock
on
Friday
,
at
Saint
George
's
church
,
in
Hart

you

be
sorry
to

that
the

restlessness

<EOS>
It
be
not
fever

a

stick

yesterday
evening

We

them
wild

they
present
the
hideous

madman

by

the

such
a

his

loud

it

it

not
her

that
the
cold

the

so
soon

His

He

stillness

in

watch
hang
over
the
mantel

shelf
;
its
low
ticking

It

the
approach

to
know
that

impossible

the
dreary
hour
through
long

such
night

It

hidden
secret
of
many
year

pour
forth
by
the
unconscious
,
helpless
being
before
you

and
to
think
how
little
the
reserve
and
cunning
of
a
whole

will
avail
,
when
fever
and
delirium
tear
off

<EOS>
strange
tale

tale
so
full

that
those

have
flee
in
horror
and
affright
,
lest
they
should
be
scare
to
madness
by
what

and
many
a
wretch
have
die
alone
,
raving
of
deed
the
very
name
of
which
have
drive
the
bold
man
away

<EOS>
but
no
such
raving

<EOS>
Their
half

stifle
sobs
and
moan
alone
break
the

and
when
at

the
mother

grasp
relaxed

and
,
turn
one
look
from
the
child
to
the

,
she
vainly
strove

fall
backward
on

pillow
<EOS>
,
all
be
so
calm

tranquil
that
she
seem

sink
to
sleep

<EOS>
They
leant
over
her

they
call
upon
her
name
,
softly
at
first
,
and
then
in
the
loud
and
pierce
tone
of
desperation
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
reply

<EOS>
They
listen
for
her
breath

no

They
feel
for
the
palpitation

<EOS>
the

His

<EOS>
He
raise
his
manacled
hand
in
a
threatening
attitude
,
fix
his
eye
on
his
shrink
parent

and
slowly
leave
the
room
;
and
neither
father
nor
sister
ever
beheld
him
more
,
on
this
side
of
the
grave
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
dim
and
misty
light
of
a
winter
's
morning
penetrate
into
the
narrow
court
,
and
struggle
through
the
begrime
window
of
the
wretched
room
,
Warden
awake
from
his
heavy
sleep
,
and
find
himself
alone
.
 
<EOS>
He
rise
,
and
look
round
him
;
the
old
flock
mattress
on
the
floor
be
undisturbed
;
everything
be
just
as
he
remember
to
have
see
it
last
:
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
no
sign
of
any
one
,
save
himself
,
have
occupy
the
room
during
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
inquire
of
the
other
lodger
,
and
of
the
neighbour
;
but
his
daughter
have
not
be
see
or
hear
of
.
 
<EOS>
He
ramble
through
the
street
,
and
scrutinise
each
wretched
face
among
the
crowd
that
throng
them
,
with
anxious
eye
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
search
be
fruitless
,
and
he
return
to
his
garret
when
night
come
on
,
desolate
and
weary
.
   
<EOS>
for
many
day
he
occupy
himself
in
the
same
manner
,
but
no
trace
of
his
daughter
<EOS>
do
he
meet
with
,
and
no
word
of
her
reach
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
he
give
up
the
pursuit
as
hopeless
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
long
thought
of
the
probability
of
her
leave
him
,
and
endeavour
to
gain
her
bread
in
quiet
,
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
leave
him
at
last
to
starve
alone
.
 
<EOS>
He
grind
his
tooth
,
and
curse
her
!
   
<EOS>
He
beg
his
bread
from
door
to
door
.
 
<EOS>
every
halfpenny
he
could
wring
from
the
pity
or
credulity
of
those
to
whom
he
address
himself
,
be
spend
in
the
old
way
.
 
<EOS>
a
year
pass
over
his
head
;
the
roof
of
a
jail
be
the
only
one
that
have
shelter
him
for
many
month
.
 
<EOS>
He
sleep
under
archway
,
and
in
brickfield
---
anywhere
,
where
there
be
some
warmth
or
shelter
from
the
cold
and
rain
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
the
last
stage
of
poverty
,
disease
,
and
houseless
want
,
he
be
a
drunkard
still
.
   
<EOS>
at
last
,
one
bitter
night
,
he
sink
down
on
a
door
-
step
faint
and
ill
.
 
<EOS>
the
premature
decay
of
vice
and
profligacy
have
wear
him
to
the
bone
.
 
<EOS>
His
cheek
be
hollow
and
livid
;
his
eye
be
sink
,
and
their
sight
be
dim
.
 
<EOS>
His
leg
tremble
beneath
his
weight
,
and
a
cold
shiver
run
through
every
limb
.
   
<EOS>
and
now
the
long
-
forget
scene
of
a
misspent
life
crowd
thick
and
fast
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
of
the
time
when
he
have
a
home
---
a
happy
,
cheerful
home
---
<EOS>
and
of
those
who
people
it
,
and
flock
about
him
then
,
until
the
form
of
his
eld
child
seem
to
rise
from
the
grave
,
and
stand
about
him
---
so
plain
,
so
clear
,
and
so
distinct
they
be
that
he
could
touch
and
feel
them
.
 
<EOS>
look
that
he
have
long
forget
be
fix
upon
him
once
more
;
voice
long
since
hush
in
death
sound
in
his
ear
like
the
music
of
village
bell
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
only
for
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
the
rain
beat
heavily
upon
him
;
and
cold
and
hunger
be
gnaw
at
his
heart
again
.
   
<EOS>
He
rise
,
and
drag
his
feeble
limb
a
few
pace
further
.
 
<EOS>
the
street
be
silent
and
empty
;
the
few
passenger
who
pass
by
,
at
that
late
hour
,
hurry
quickly
on
,
and
his
tremulous
voice
be
lose
in
the
violence
of
the
storm
.
 
<EOS>
again
that
heavy
chill
strike
through
his
frame
,
and
his
blood
seem
to
stagnate
beneath
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
coil
himself
up
in
a
projecting
doorway
,
and
try
to
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
but
sleep
have
flee
from
his
dull
and
glazed
eye
.
 
<EOS>
His
mind
wander
strangely
,
but
he
be
awake
,
and
conscious
.
 
<EOS>
the
well
-
know
shout
of
drunken
mirth
sound
in
his
ear
,
the
glass
be
at
his
lip
,
the
board
be
cover
with
choice
rich
food
---
they
be
before
him
:
 
<EOS>
he
could
see
them
all
,
he
have
but
to
reach
out
his
hand
,
and
take
them
---
and
,
<EOS>
though
the
illusion
be
reality
itself
,
he
know
that
he
be
sit
alone
in
the
deserted
street
,
watch
the
rain
-
drop
as
they
patter
on
the
stone
;
that
death
be
come
upon
him
by
inch
---
and
that
there
be
none
to
care
for
or
help
him
.
   
<EOS>
suddenly
he
start
up
,
in
the
extremity
of
terror
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
hear
his
own
voice
shout
in
the
night
air
,
he
know
not
what
,
or
why
.
<EOS>
hark
!
 
<EOS>
a
groan
!
<EOS>
---
another
!
 
<EOS>
His
sense
be
leave
him
:
 
half
-
form
and
incoherent
word
burst
from
his
lip
;
and
his
hand
seek
to
tear
and
lacerate
his
flesh
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
go
mad
,
and
he
shriek
for
help
till
his
voice
fail
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
raise
his
head
,
and
look
up
the
long
dismal
street
.
 
<EOS>
He
recollect
that
outcast
like
himself
,
condemn
to
wander
day
and
night
in
those
dreadful
street
,
have
sometimes
go
distracted
with
their
own
loneliness
.
 
<EOS>
He
remember
to
have
hear
many
year
before
that
a
homeless
wretch
have
once
be
find
in
a
solitary
corner
,
sharpen
a
rusty
knife
to
plunge
into
his
own
heart
,
prefer
death
to
that
endless
,
weary
,
wander
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
in
an
instant
his
resolve
be
take
,
his
limb
receive
new
life
;
he
run
quickly
from
the
spot
,
and
pause
not
for
breath
until
he
reach
the
river
-
side
.
   
<EOS>
He
creep
softly
down
the
steep
stone
stair
that
lead
from
the
commencement
of
Waterloo
Bridge
,
down
to
the
water
's
level
.
 
<EOS>
He
crouch
into
a
corner
,
and
hold
his
breath
,
as
the
patrol
pass
.
<EOS>
never
do
prisoner
's
heart
throb
with
the
hope
of
liberty
and
life
half
so
eagerly
as
do
that
of
the
wretched
man
at
the
prospect
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
the
watch
pass
close
to
him
,
but
he
remain
unobserved
;
and
after
wait
till
the
sound
of
footstep
have
die
away
in
the
distance
,
he
cautiously
descend
,
and
stand
beneath
the
gloomy
arch
that
form
the
landing
-
place
from
the
river
.
   
<EOS>
the
tide
be
in
,
and
the
water
flow
at
his
foot
.
 
<EOS>
the
rain
have
cease
,
the
wind
be
lull
,
and
all
be
,
for
the
moment
,
still
and
quiet
---
so
quiet
,
that
the
slight
sound
on
the
opposite
bank
,
even
the
rippling
of
the
water
against
the
barge
that
be
moor
there
,
be
distinctly
audible
to
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
the
stream
stole
languidly
and
sluggishly
on
.
 
<EOS>
strange
and
fantastic
form
rise
to
the
surface
,
and
beckon
him
to
approach
;
dark
gleaming
eye
peer
from
the
water
,
and
seem
to
mock
his
hesitation
,
while
hollow
murmur
from
behind
,
urge
him
onwards
.
 
<EOS>
He
retreat
a
few
pace
,
take
a
short
run
,
desperate
leap
,
and
plunge
into
the
river
.
   
<EOS>
not
five
second
have
pass
when
he
rise
to
the
water
's
surface
---
but
what
a
change
have
take
place
in
that
short
time
,
in
all
his
thought
and
feeling
!
 
<EOS>
life
---
life
in
any
form
,
poverty
,
misery
,
starvation
---
anything
but
death
.
 
<EOS>
He
fight
and
struggle
with
the
water
that
close
over
his
head
,
and
scream
in
agony
of
terror
.
<EOS>
the
curse
of
his
own
son
rang
in
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
the
shore
---
but
one
foot
of
dry
ground
---
he
could
almost
touch
the
step
.
 
<EOS>
one
hand
's
breadth
nearer
,
and
he
be
save
---
but
the
tide
bear
him
onward
,
under
the
dark
arch
of
the
bridge
,
and
he
sink
to
the
bottom
.
   
<EOS>
again
he
rise
,
and
struggle
for
life
.
 
<EOS>
for
one
instant
---
for
one
brief
instant
---
the
building
on
the
river
's
bank
,
the
light
on
the
bridge
through
which
the
current
have
bear
him
,
the
black
water
,
and
the
fast
-
fly
cloud
,
be
distinctly
visible
---
once
more
he
sink
,
and
once
again
he
rise
.
 
<EOS>
bright
flame
of
fire
shoot
up
from
earth
to
heaven
,
and
reel
before
his
eye
,
while
the
water
thunder
in
his
ear
,
and
stun
him
with
its
furious
roar
.
   
<EOS>
a
week
afterwards
the
body
be
wash
ashore
,
some
mile
down
the
river
,
a
swollen
and
disfigure
mass
.
 
<EOS>
unrecognised
and
unpitied
,
it
be
bear
to
the
grave
;
and
there
it
have
long
since
moulder
away
!
