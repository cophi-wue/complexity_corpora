information
about
the

<EOS>
some
sage
observation
that
naturally
introduce
our
important
history
.
   
<EOS>
Cardinal
de
Retz
very
judiciously
observe
,
that
all
historian
must
of
necessity
be
subject
to
mistake
,
in
explain
the
motive
of
those
action
they
record
,
unless
they
derive
their
intelligence
from
the
candid
confession
of
the
person
whose
character
they
represent
;
and
that
,
of
consequence
,
every
man
of
importance
ought
to
write
his
own
memoir
,
<EOS>
provide
he
have
honesty
enough
to
tell
the
truth
,
without
suppress
any
circumstance
,
that
may
tend
to
the
information
of
the
reader
.
    
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
a
requisite
that
,
I
be
afraid
,
would
be
very
rarely
find
among
the
number
of
those
who
exhibit
their
own
portrait
to
the
public
:
indeed
,
I
will
venture
to
say
,
that
how
upright
soever
a
man
's
intention
may
be
,
he
will
,
in
the
performance
of
such
a
task
,
be
sometimes
mislead
by
his
own
phantasy
,
and
represent
object
as
they
appear
to
him
,
thro
'
the
mist
of
prejudice
and
passion
.
    
<EOS>
an
unconcerned
reader
,
when
he
peruse
the
history
of
two
competitor
,
who
live
two
thousand
year
ago
,
or
who
,
perhaps
,
never
have
existence
,
except
in
the
imagination
of
the
author
,
can
not
help
interesting
himself
in
the
dispute
,
and
espouse
one
side
of
the
contest
,
with
all
the
zeal
of
a
warm
adherent
.
 
<EOS>
what
wonder
then
,
that
we
should
be
heat
in
our
own
concern
;
review
our
action
with
the
same
self
-
approbation
that
they
have
formerly
acquire
,
and
recommend
them
to
the
world
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
paternal
affection
?
    
<EOS>
suppose
this
to
be
the
case
,
it
be
lucky
for
the
cause
of
historical
truth
,
that
so
many
pen
have
be
draw
by
writer
,
who
could
not
be
suspect
of
such
partiality
;
and
that
many
great
personage
,
among
the
antient
as
well
as
modern
,
either
would
not
,
or
could
not
entertain
the
public
with
their
own
memoir
.
 
<EOS>
from
this
want
of
inclination
or
capacity
to
write
,
in
our
hero
himself
,
the
undertaking
be
now
leave
to
me
,
of
transmit
to
posterity
,
the
remarkable
adventure
of
Ferdinand
Count
Fathom
;
and
by
that
time
the
reader
shall
have
glance
over
the
subsequent
sheet
,
I
doubt
not
but
he
will
bless
God
,
that
the
adventurer
be
not
his
own
historian
.
    
<EOS>
this
mirrour
of
modern
chivalry
be
none
of
those
who
owe
their
dignity
to
the
circumstance
of
their
birth
,
and
be
consecrate
from
the
cradle
for
the
purpose
of
greatness
,
merely
because
they
be
the
accidental
child
of
wealth
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
heir
to
no
visible
patrimony
,
unless
we
reckon
a
robust
constitution
,
a
tolerable
appearance
,
and
an
uncommon
capacity
,
as
the
advantage
of
inheritance
:
if
the
comparison
obtain
in
this
point
of
consideration
,
he
be
,
as
much
as
any
man
,
indebte
to
his
parent
;
and
pity
it
be
,
that
in
the
sequel
of
his
fortune
,
he
never
have
an
opportunity
of
manifest
his
filial
gratitude
and
regard
.
 
<EOS>
from
this
agreeable
act
of
duty
to
his
sire
,
and
all
those
tenderness
that
be
reciprocally
enjoy
betwixt
the
father
and
the
son
,
he
be
unhappily
exclude
by
a
small
circumstance
;
at
which
,
however
,
he
be
never
hear
to
repine
.
    
<EOS>
in
short
,
have
he
be
bring
forth
in
the
fabulous
age
of
the
world
,
the
nature
of
his
origin
may
have
turn
to
his
account
;
he
may
,
like
other
hero
of
antiquity
,
have
lay
claim
to
divine
extraction
,
without
run
the
risque
of
be
claim
by
any
earthly
father
;
not
that
his
parent
have
any
reason
to
disown
or
renounce
their
offspring
,
or
that
there
be
any
thing
preternatural
in
the
circumstance
of
his
generation
and
birth
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
be
,
from
the
beginning
,
a
child
of
promising
part
,
and
in
due
course
of
nature
,
usher
into
the
world
,
amidst
a
whole
cloud
of
witness
:
but
,
that
he
be
acknowledge
by
no
mortal
sire
,
solely
proceed
from
the
uncertainty
of
his
mother
,
whose
affection
be
so
dissipated
among
a
number
of
admirer
,
that
she
could
never
pitch
upon
the
person
from
whose
loin
our
hero
sprung
.
    
<EOS>
Over
and
above
this
important
doubt
,
under
which
he
be
begotten
,
other
particularity
attend
his
birth
,
and
seem
to
mark
him
out
as
something
uncommon
among
the
son
of
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
bring
forth
in
a
waggon
,
and
may
be
say
to
be
literally
a
native
of
two
different
country
;
for
,
though
he
first
see
the
light
in
Holland
,
he
be
not
bear
till
after
the
carriage
arrive
in
flander
;
so
that
all
these
extraordinary
circumstance
consider
,
the
task
of
determine
to
what
government
he
naturally
owe
allegiance
,
would
be
at
least
as
difficult
,
as
that
of
ascertain
the
so
much
contest
birth
-
place
of
Homer
.
    
<EOS>
Certain
<EOS>
it
be
,
the
Count
's
mother
be
an
Englishwoman
,
who
,
after
have
be
five
time
a
widow
in
one
compaign
,
be
,
in
the
last
year
of
the
renowned
Marlborough
's
command
,
number
among
the
baggage
of
the
ally
army
,
which
she
still
accompany
,
thro
'
pure
benevolence
of
spirit
,
supply
the
rank
with
the
refresh
stream
of
choice
geneva
,
and
accommodate
individual
with
clean
linen
,
as
the
emergency
of
their
occasion
require
:
nor
<EOS>
be
her
philanthropy
altogether
confine
to
such
ministration
<EOS>
:
she
abound
with
"
the
milk
of
human
kindness
,
"
which
flow
plentifully
among
her
fellow
-
creature
;
and
to
every
son
of
Mars
who
cultivate
her
favour
,
she
liberally
dispense
her
smile
,
in
order
to
sweeten
the
toil
and
danger
of
the
field
.
    
<EOS>
and
here
it
will
not
be
amiss
to
anticipate
the
remak
of
the
reader
,
who
,
in
the
chastity
and
excellency
of
his
conception
,
may
possibly
exclaim
,
"
Good
Heaven
!
<EOS>
will
these
author
never
reform
their
imagination
,
and
lift
their
idea
from
the
obscene
object
of
low
life
?
 
<EOS>
Must
the
public
be
again
disgust
with
the
grovel
adventure
of
a
waggon
?
 
<EOS>
Will
no
writer
of
genius
draw
his
pen
in
the
vindication
of
taste
,
and
entertain
us
with
the
agreeable
character
,
the
dignified
conversation
,
the
poignant
repartee
,
in
short
,
the
genteel
comedy
of
the
polite
world
?
"
    
<EOS>
have
a
little
patience
,
gentle
,
delicate
,
sublime
,
critic
;
you
,
I
doubt
not
,
be
one
of
those
consummate
connoisser
,
who
,
in
their
purification
,
let
humour
evaporate
,
while
they
endeavour
to
preserve
decorum
,
and
polish
wit
,
until
the
edge
of
it
be
quite
wear
off
:
or
,
perhaps
of
that
class
,
who
,
in
the
sapience
of
taste
,
be
disgust
with
those
very
flavour
,
in
the
production
of
their
own
country
,
which
have
yield
infinite
delectation
to
their
faculty
,
when
import
from
another
clime
:
and
damn
an
author
in
despite
of
all
precedent
and
prescription
;
who
extol
the
writing
of
Petronius
Arbiter
,
read
with
rapture
the
amorous
sally
of
Ovid
's
pen
,
and
chuckle
over
the
story
of
Lucian
's
ass
;
yet
,
if
a
modern
author
presume
to
relate
the
progress
of
a
simple
intrigue
,
be
shock
at
the
indecency
and
immorality
of
the
scene
:
<EOS>
who
delight
in
follow
Guzman
d
'
Alfarache
,
thro
'
all
the
maze
of
squalid
beggary
;
who
with
pleasure
accompany
Don
Quixote
and
his
squire
,
in
the
low
path
of
fortune
;
who
be
divert
with
the
adventure
of
Scarron
's
ragged
troop
of
stroller
,
and
highly
entertain
with
the
servile
situation
of
Gil
Blas
;
yet
,
when
a
character
in
humble
life
occasionally
occur
in
a
performance
of
our
own
growth
,
exclaim
with
an
air
of
disgust
,
"
be
ever
any
thing
<EOS>
so
mean
!
 
<EOS>
sure
,
this
writer
must
have
be
very
conversant
with
the
low
scene
of
life
:
"
who
,
when
Swift
or
Pope
represent
a
coxcomb
in
the
act
of
swearing
,
scruple
not
to
laugh
at
the
ridiculous
execration
;
but
in
a
less
reputed
author
,
condemn
the
use
of
such
profane
expletive
:
who
eagerly
explore
the
joke
of
Rabelais
,
for
amusement
,
and
even
extract
humour
from
the
dean
's
description
of
a
lady
's
dressing
room
:
yet
,
in
a
production
of
these
day
,
unstampt
with
such
venerable
name
,
will
stop
their
nose
with
all
the
sign
of
loathing
and
abhorrence
,
at
a
bare
mention
of
the
china
chamber
-
pot
:
who
applaud
Catullus
,
Juvenal
,
Persius
and
Lucan
,
for
their
spirit
in
lash
the
great
name
of
antiquity
;
yet
,
when
a
british
satirist
,
of
this
generation
,
have
courage
enough
to
call
in
question
the
talent
of
a
Pseudo
patron
,
in
power
,
accuse
him
of
insolence
,
rancour
and
scurrility
.
    
<EOS>
if
such
you
be
,
courteous
reader
,
I
say
again
,
have
a
little
patience
;
for
your
entertainment
we
be
about
to
write
.
 
<EOS>
Our
hero
shall
,
with
all
convenient
dispatch
,
be
gradually
sublime
,
into
those
splendid
connection
of
which
you
be
enamour
;
and
God
forbid
,
that
in
the
mean
time
,
the
nature
of
his
extraction
should
turn
to
his
prejudice
,
in
a
land
of
freedom
like
this
,
where
individual
be
every
day
ennoble
in
consequence
of
their
own
qualification
,
without
the
least
retrospective
regard
to
the
rank
or
merit
of
their
ancestor
.
    
<EOS>
yes
,
refined
reader
,
we
be
hasten
to
that
goal
of
perfection
,
where
satire
dare
not
shew
her
face
;
where
nature
be
castigate
,
almost
even
to
still
life
;
where
humour
turn
changele
,
and
slaver
in
an
insipid
grin
;
where
wit
be
volatilize
into
a
meer
vapour
;
where
decency
,
divest
of
all
substance
,
hover
about
like
a
fantastic
shadow
;
where
the
salt
of
genius
,
escape
,
leave
nothing
but
pure
and
simple
phlegm
;
and
the
inoffensive
pen
for
ever
drop
the
mild
manna
of
soul
-
sweetne
praise
.
     
<EOS>
a
superficial
view
of
our
hero
's
infancy
;
   
<EOS>
have
thus
bespeak
the
indulgence
of
our
guest
,
let
us
now
produce
the
particular
of
our
entertainment
,
and
speedily
conduct
our
adventurer
through
the
stage
of
infancy
,
which
seldom
teem
with
interesting
incident
.
    
<EOS>
as
the
occupation
of
his
mother
would
not
conveniently
permit
her
to
suckle
this
her
first
-
bear
at
her
own
breast
,
and
those
happy
age
be
now
no
more
,
in
which
the
charge
of
nurse
a
child
may
be
leave
to
the
next
goat
or
the
she
-
wolf
,
she
resolve
to
improve
upon
the
ordinance
of
nature
,
and
foster
him
with
a
juice
much
more
energic
than
the
milk
of
goat
,
or
wolf
,
or
woman
;
this
be
no
other
than
that
delicious
nectar
,
which
,
as
we
have
already
hint
,
she
so
cordially
distribute
from
a
small
cask
that
hang
before
her
,
depend
from
her
shoulder
by
a
leathern
zone
.
    
<EOS>
thus
determine
,
ere
he
be
yet
twelve
day
old
,
she
enclose
him
in
a
canvas
knapsack
,
which
be
adjust
to
her
neck
,
fall
down
upon
her
back
,
and
ballance
the
cargo
that
rest
on
her
bosom
.
    
<EOS>
there
be
not
want
those
who
affirm
,
that
while
her
double
charge
be
carry
about
in
this
situation
,
her
cag
be
furnish
with
a
long
and
slend
flexible
tube
,
which
,
when
the
child
begin
to
be
clamorous
,
she
convey
into
his
mouth
,
and
strait
he
still
himself
with
suck
;
but
this
we
consider
as
an
extravagant
assertion
of
those
,
who
mix
the
marvellous
in
all
their
narration
,
because
we
can
not
conceive
how
the
tender
organ
of
an
infant
,
could
digest
such
a
fiery
beverage
,
which
never
fail
to
discompose
the
constitution
of
the
most
hardy
and
robust
:
we
therefore
conclude
,
that
the
use
of
this
potation
be
more
restrained
,
and
that
it
be
with
simple
element
,
dilute
into
a
composition
adapt
to
his
taste
and
year
.
 
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
will
,
he
certainly
be
indulge
in
the
use
of
it
to
such
a
degree
,
as
would
have
effectually
obstruct
his
future
fortune
,
have
not
he
be
happily
cloy
with
the
repetition
of
the
same
fare
,
for
which
he
conceive
the
utmost
detestation
and
abhorrence
,
reject
it
with
loathing
and
disgust
,
like
those
choice
spirit
,
who
,
have
be
cram
with
religion
in
their
childhood
,
renounce
it
in
their
youth
,
among
other
absurd
prejudice
of
education
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
thus
dangle
in
a
state
of
suspension
,
a
german
trooper
be
transiently
smit
with
the
charm
of
his
mother
,
who
listen
to
his
honourable
address
,
and
once
more
receive
the
silken
bond
of
matrimony
;
the
ceremony
have
be
perform
as
usual
at
the
drum
-
head
.
 
<EOS>
the
lady
have
no
sooner
take
possession
of
her
new
name
,
than
she
bestow
it
upon
her
son
,
who
be
thenceforward
distinguish
by
the
appellation
of
Ferdinand
de
Fadom
;
nor
be
the
husband
offend
at
this
presumption
in
his
wife
,
which
he
not
only
consider
as
a
proof
of
her
affection
and
esteem
,
but
also
as
a
compliment
,
by
which
he
may
in
time
acquire
the
credit
of
be
the
real
father
of
such
an
hopeful
child
.
    
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
new
engagement
with
a
foreigner
,
our
Hero
's
mother
still
exercise
the
virtue
of
her
call
among
the
english
troop
,
so
much
be
she
bias
by
that
laudable
partiality
,
which
,
as
Horace
observe
,
the
natale
solum
generally
inspire
:
indeed
this
inclination
be
enforce
by
another
reason
,
that
do
not
fail
to
influence
her
conduct
in
this
particular
;
all
her
knowledge
of
the
high
dutch
language
consist
in
some
word
of
traffic
,
absolutely
necessary
for
the
practice
of
her
vocation
;
together
with
sundry
oath
and
term
of
reproach
,
that
keep
her
customer
in
awe
;
so
that
,
except
among
her
own
countryman
,
she
could
not
indulge
that
propensity
to
conversation
,
for
which
she
have
be
remarkable
from
her
early
year
.
 
<EOS>
nor
do
this
instance
of
her
affection
fail
of
turn
to
her
account
in
the
sequel
:
 
<EOS>
She
be
promote
to
the
office
of
cook
to
a
regimental
mess
of
officer
;
and
before
the
peace
of
Utrecht
,
be
actually
in
possession
of
a
suttling
-
tent
,
pitch
for
the
accommodation
of
the
gentleman
of

It

the

with
such
a

among

inconsiderable

but
,
intoxicate
with
the
glory
she
have
win
,
intice
by
the
glitter
caparison
that
lie
scatter
on
the
plain
,
and
without
doubt
,
prompt
by
the
secret
instinct
of
her
fate
<EOS>
,
she
resolve
to
seize
opportunity
by
the
fore
lock
,
and
once
for
all
indemnify
herself
for
the
many
fatigue
,
hazard
and
sorrow
she
have
undergo
.
    
<EOS>
thus
determine
,
she
reconnoitre
the
field
,
and
practise
her
address
so
successfully
,
that
in
less
than
half
an
hour
,
she
be
load
with
ermin
and
embroidery
,
and
dispose
to
retreat
with
her
burden
,
when
her
regard
be
solicit
by
a
splendid
bundle
,
which
she
descry
at
some
distance
lie
on
the
ground
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
no
other
than
an
unhappy
officer
of
hussar
;
who
,
after
have
have
the
good
fortune
to
take
a
turkish
standard
,
be
desperately
wound
in
the
thigh
,
and
oblige
to
quit
his
horse
;
find
himself
in
such
an
helpless
condition
,
he
have
wrap
his
acquisition
round
his
body
,
that
whatever
may
happen
,
he
and
his
glory
should
not
be
part
;
and
thus
shroud
among
the
dying
and
the
dead
,
he
have
observe
the
progress
of
our
heroine
,
who
stalk
about
the
field
,
like
another
Atropos
,
finish
,
wherever
she
come
,
the
work
of
death
:
he
do
not
at
all
doubt
,
that
he
himself
would
be
visit
in
the
course
of
her
peregrination
,
and
therefore
provide
for
her
reception
,
with
a
pistol
ready
<EOS>
cock'd
<EOS>
in
his
hand
,
while
he
lie
perdue
,
beneath
his
covert
,
in
all
appearance
bereft
of
life
:
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
deceive
in
his
prognostic
;
she
no
sooner
eye
the
golden
crescent
,
than
,
enflame
with
curiosity
or
cupidity
,
she
direct
thitherward
her
step
,
and
discern
the
carcase
of
a
man
,
from
which
she
think
,
there
would
be
a
necessity
for
disengage
it
,
she
lift
up
her
weapon
,
in
order
to
make
sure
of
her
purchase
;
and
in
the
very
instant
of
discharge
her
blow
,
receiv'd
a
brace
of
bullet
in
her
brain
.
    
<EOS>
thus
end
the
mortal
pilgrimage
of
this
modern
amazon
;
who
,
in
point
of
courage
,
be
not
inferior
to
Semiramis
,
Tomyris
,
Zenobia
,
Thalestris
,
or
any
boasted
heroine
of
antient
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
suppose
,
that
this
catastrophe
make
a
very
deep
impression
upon
the
mind
of
young
Ferdinand
,
who
have
just
then
attain
the
ninth
year
of
his
age
,
and
be
,
for
a
considerable
time
,
wean
from
her
maternal
caress
;
especially
,
as
he
feel
no
want
nor
grievance
in
the
family
of
the
count
,
who
favour
him
with
a
particular
share
of
indulgence
,
because
he
perceive
in
him
a
spirit
of
docility
,
insinuation
,
and
sagacity
,
far
above
his
year
.
    
<EOS>
He
do
not
,
however
,
fail
to
lament
the
untimely
fate
of
his
mother
,
with
such
filial
expression
of
sorrow
,
as
still
more
intimately
recommend
him
to
his
patron
;
who
,
be
himself
a
man
of
extraordinary
benevolence
,
look
upon
the
boy
as
a
prodigy
of
natural
affection
,
and
foresaw
in
his
future
service
a
fund
of
gratitude
and
attachment
,
that
could
not
fail
to
render
him
a
valuable
acquisition
to
his
family
.
    
<EOS>
in
his
own
country
he
have
often
see
connection
of
that
sort
,
which
have
be
plant
in
the
infancy
of
the
adherent
,
have
grow
up
to
a
surprizing
pitch
of
fidelity
and
friendship
,
that
no
temptation
could
biass
,
and
no
danger
dissolve
.
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
rejoice
in
the
hope
of
see
his
own
son
accommodate
with
such
a
faithful
attendant
,
in
the
person
of
young
Fathom
,
on
whom
he
resolve
to
bestow
the
same
education
he
have
plan
for
the
other
,
though
convey
in
such
a
manner
as
should
be
suitable
to
the
sphere
in
which
he
be
ordain
to
move
.
 
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
these
determination
,
our
young
adventurer
lead
a
very
easy
life
,
in
quality
of
page
to
the
count
,
in
whose
tent
he
lie
upon
a
pallet
,
close
to
his
field
bed
,
and
often
divert
him
with
his
childish
prattle
in
the
english
tongue
,
which
the
more
seldom
his
master
have
occasion
to
speak
,
he
the
more
delighted
to
hear
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
exercise
of
his
function
,
the
boy
be
incredibly
assiduous
and
alert
;
far
from
neglect
the
little
particular
of
his
duty
,
and
embark
in
the
mischievous
amusement
of
the
child
belong
to
the
camp
,
he
be
always
diligent
,
sedate
,
agreeably
officious
and
anticipate
,
and
in
the
whole
of
his
behaviour
,
seem
to
express
the
most
vigilant
sense
of
his
patron
's
goodness
and
generosity
:
nay
,
to
such
a
degree
have
these
sentiment
,
in
all
appearance
,
operate
upon
his
reflection
,
that
,
one
morning
while
he
suppose
the
count
asleep
,
he
creep
softly
to
his
bed
-
side
,
and
gently
kiss
his
hand
,
which
happen
to
be
uncover
,
pronounce
,
in
a
low
voice
,
a
most
fervent
prayer
in
his
behalf
,
beseech
Heaven
to
shower
down
blessing
upon
him
,
as
the
widow
's
friend
and
the
orphan
's
father
:
this
benediction
be
not
lose
upon
the
count
,
who
chance
to
be
awake
,
and
hear
it
with
admiration
;
but
what
rivette
Ferdinand
in
his
good
grace
,
be
a
discovery
that
our
youth
make
,
while
his
master
be
upon
duty
in
the
trench
before
Belgrade
.
    
<EOS>
two
foot
-
soldier
stand
centry
near
the
door
of
the
tent
,
be
captivate
with
the
sight
of
some
valuable
moveable
belong
to
it
;
and
supose
,
in
their
great
wisdom
,
that
the
city
of
Belgrade
be
too
well
fortified
to
be
take
during
that
campaign
,
they
come
to
a
resolution
of
withdraw
themselves
from
the
severe
service
of
the
trench
,
by
desert
to
the
enemy
,
after
they
should
have
rifle
count
Melvil
's
tent
,
of
the
furniture
by
which
they
be
so
powerfully
allure
:
the
particular
of
this
plan
be
concert
in
the
french
language
,
which
,
they
imagine
,
would
screen
them
from
all
risk
of
be
detect
,
in
case
they
should
be
overhear
,
though
,
as
there
be
no
live
creature
in
sight
,
they
have
no
reason
to
believe
,
that
any
person
be
privy
to
their
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
they
be
mistake
in
both
these
conjecture
.
    
<EOS>
the
conference
reach
the
ear
of
Fathom
,
who
be
at
the
other
end
of
the
tent
,
and
have
perceive
the
eager
look
,
with
which
they
consider
some
part
of
the
furniture
:
he
have
penetration
enough
to
suspect
their
desire
,
and
alarm
by
that
suspicion
,
listen
attentively
to
their
discourse
,
which
from
a
slend
knowledge
in
the
french
tongue
,
he
have
the
good
fortune
partly
to
understand
.
    
<EOS>
this
important
piece
of
intelligence
he
communicate
to
the
count
at
his
return
,
and
measure
be
immediately
take
to
defeat
the
design
,
and
make
an
example
of
the
author
,
who
be
permit
to
load
themselves
with
the
booty
,
be
apprehend
in
their
retreat
,
and
punish
with
death
accord
to
their
demerit
.
     
<EOS>
a
brief
detail
of
his
education
.
   
<EOS>
nothing
could
have
more
seasonably
happen
,
to
confirm
the
good
opinion
which
the
colonel
entertain
of
Ferdinand
's
principle
:
his
intention
towards
the
boy
grow
every
day
more
and
more
warm
;
and
immediately
after
the
peace
of
Passarowitz
,
he
retire
to
his
own
house
at
Presburg
,
and
present
young
Fathom
to
his
lady
,
not
only
as
the
son
of
a
person
to
whom
he
owe
his
life
,
but
also
as
a
lad
,
who
merit
his
peculiar
protection
and
regard
by
his
own
personal
virtue
.
    
<EOS>
the
countess
,
who
be
an
Hungarian
,
receive
him
with
great
kindness
and
affability
,
and
her
son
be
ravish
with
the
prospect
of
enjoy
such
a
companion
:
in
short
,
fortune
seem
to
have
provide
for
him
an
asylum
,
in
which
he
may
be
safely
train
up
,
and
suitably
prepare
for
more
important
scene
of
life
,
than
any
of
his
ancestor
have
ever
know
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
not
,
in
all
respect
,
entertain
on
the
footing
of
his
young
master
;
yet
he
share
in
all
his
education
and
amusement
,
as
one
whom
the
old
gentleman
be
fully
determine
to
qualify
for
the
station
of
an
officer
in
the
service
;
and
if
he
do
not
eat
with
the
count
,
he
be
every
day
regale
with
choice
bit
from
his
table
;
hold
,
as
it
be
,
a
middle
place
between
the
rank
of
a
relation
,
and
favour
domestic
.
 
<EOS>
although
his
patron
maintain
a
tutor
in
the
house
,
to
superintend
the
conduct
of
his
heir
,
he
commit
the
charge
of
his
learning
to
the
instruction
of
a
publick
school
;
where
,
he
imagne
,
the
boy
would
imbibe
a
laudable
spirit
of
emulation
among
his
fellow
,
which
could
not
fail
of
turn
out
to
the
advantage
of
his
education
.
 
<EOS>
Ferdinand
be
enter
in
the
same
academy
;
and
the
two
lad
proceed
equally
in
the
path
of
erudition
;
a
mutual
friendship
and
intimacy
soon
ensue
,
and
notwithstanding
the
levity
and
caprice
commonly
discernible
in
the
behaviour
of
such
boy
,
very
few
,
or
rather
no
quarrel
happen
in
the
course
of
their
communication
.
 
<EOS>
yet
their
disposition
be
altogether
different
,
and
their
talent
unlike
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
this
dissimilarity
be
the
very
bond
of
their
union
;
because
it
prevent
that
jealousy
and
rivalship
which
often
interrupt
the
harmony
of
two
warm
co
-
temporary
.
    
<EOS>
the
young
count
make
extraordinary
progress
in
the
exercise
of
the
school
,
though
he
seem
to
take
very
little
pain
in
the
cultivation
of
his
study
;
and
become
a
perfect
hero
in
all
the
athletic
diversion
of
his
fellow
-
scholar
;
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
exhibit
such
a
bashful
appearance
and
uncouth
address
,
that
his
mother
despair
of
ever
see
him
improve
into
any
degree
of
polite
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
Fathom
,
who
be
in
point
of
learn
a
mere
dunce
,
become
,
even
in
his
childhood
,
remarkable
among
the
lady
for
his
genteel
deportment
and
vivacity
;
they
admire
the
proficiency
he
make
,
under
the
direction
of
his
dancing
master
,
the
air
with
which
he
perform
his
obeisance
at
his
entrance
and
exit
;
and
be
charm
with
the
agreeable
assurance
and
lively
sally
of
his
conversation
;
while
they
express
the
utmost
concern
and
disgust
at
the
boorish
demeanour
of
his
companion
,
whose
extort
bow
resemble
the
pawing
of
a
mule
,
who
hang
his
head
in
silence
,
like
a
detected
sheep
-
stealer
,
who
sit
in
company
under
the
most
aukward
expression
of
constraint
,
and
whose
discourse
never
exceed
the
simple
monosyllable
of
negation
and
assent
.
    
<EOS>
in
vain
do
all
the
female
of
the
family
propose
to
him
young
Fathom
,
as
a
pattern
and
reproach
:
he
remain
unaltered
by
all
their
effort
and
expostulation
,
and
allow
our
adventurer
to
enjoy
the
triumph
of
his
praise
,
while
he
himself
be
conscious
of
his
own
superiority
in
those
qualification
which
seem
of
more
real
importance
than
the
meer
exterior
and
form
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
His
present
ambition
be
,
not
to
make
a
figure
at
his
father
's
table
,
but
to
eclipse
his
rival
at
school
,
and
to
acquire
an
influence
and
authority
among
these
confederate
.
    
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
Fathom
may
possibly
have
fall
under
his
displeasure
or
contempt
,
have
not
that
pliant
genius
find
mean
to
retain
his
friendship
by
seasonable
compliance
and
submission
;
for
the
sole
study
,
or
at
least
the
chief
aim
of
Ferdinand
,
be
to
make
himself
necessary
and
agreeable
to
those
on
whom
his
dependance
be
place
<EOS>
:
his
talent
be
in
this
particular
suit
to
his
inclination
;
he
seem
to
have
inherit
it
from
his
mother
's
womb
;
and
without
all
doubt
,
would
have
raise
upon
it
a
most
admirable
superstructure
of
fortune
and
applause
,
have
not
it
be
inseparably
yoke
with
a
most
insidious
principle
of
self
-
love
,
that
grow
up
with
him
from
the
cradle
,
and
leave
no
room
in
his
heart
for
the
least
particle
of
social
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
this
last
,
however
,
he
know
so
well
how
to
counterfeit
,
by
mean
of
a
large
share
of
ductility
and
dissimulation
,
that
,
surely
,
he
be
calculate
by
nature
,
to
dupe
even
the
most
cautious
,
and
gratify
his
appetite
by
levy
contribution
on
all
mankind
.
    
<EOS>
so
little
be
the
common
instructor
of
youth
,
qualify
to
judge
the
capacity
of
those
who
be
under
their
tutelage
and
care
,
that
Fathom
,
by
dint
of
his
insinuate
art
,
make
shift
to
pass
upon
the
schoolmaster
,
as
a
lad
of
quick
part
,
in
despite
of
a
natural
inaptitude
to
retain
his
lesson
,
which
all
his
industry
could
never
overcome
.
 
<EOS>
in
order
to
remedy
,
or
rather
to
cloak
this
defect
in
his
understanding
,
he
have
always
recourse
to
the
friendship
of
the
young
count
,
who
freely
permit
him
to
transcribe
his
exercise
,
until
a
small
accident
happen
,
which
have
well
-
nigh
put
a
stop
to
these
instance
of
his
generosity
.
      
<EOS>
the
adventure
,
inconsiderable
as
it
be
,
we
shall
record
,
as
the
first
overt
-
act
of
Ferdinand
's
true
character
,
as
well
as
an
illustration
of
the
opinion
we
have
advance
,
touch
the
blind
and
injudicious
decision
of
a
right
pedagogue
.
    
<EOS>
among
other
task
impose
by
the
pedant
,
upon
the
form
to
which
our
two
companion
belong
,
they
be
one
evening
order
to
translate
a
chapter
of
Caesar
's
commentary
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
the
young
count
go
to
work
,
and
perform
the
undertaking
with
great
elegance
and
dispatch
:
 
Fathom
have
spend
the
night
in
more
effeminate
amusement
,
be
next
morning
so
much
hurried
for
want
of
time
,
that
in
his
transcription
,
he
neglect
to
insert
a
few
variation
from
the
text
;
these
be
the
term
on
which
he
be
allow
to
use
it
:
so
that
it
be
verbatim
a
copy
of
the
original
.
 
<EOS>
as
those
exercise
be
always
deliver
in
a
heap
,
subscribe
with
the
several
name
of
the
boy
to
whom
they
belong
;
the
schoolmaster
chance
to
peruse
the
version
of
Ferdinand
,
before
he
look
into
any
of
the
rest
,
and
could
not
help
bestow
upon
it
particular
mark
of
approbation
:
<EOS>
the
next
that
fall
under
his
examination
be
that
of
the
young
count
,
when
he
immediately
perceive
the
sameness
,
and
far
from
impute
it
to
the
true
cause
,
upbraid
him
with
have
copy
the
exercise
of
our
adventurer
,
and
insist
upon
chastise
him
upon
the
spot
,
for
his
want
of
application
.
    
<EOS>
have
not
the
young
gentleman
think
his
honour
be
concern
<EOS>
,
he
would
have
submit
to
the
punishment
without
murmur
;
but
he
inherit
from
his
parent
the
pride
of
two
fierce
nation
,
and
be
overwhelm
with
reproach
,
for
that
which
,
he
imagine
,
ought
to
have
redound
to
his
glory
,
he
could
not
brook
the
indignity
,
and
boldly
affirm
,
that
he
himself
be
the
original
,
to
whom
Ferdinand
be
behold
for
his
performance
.
 
<EOS>
the
school
-
master
,
nettle
to
find
himself
mistaken
in
his
judgment
,
resolve
that
the
count
should
have
no
cause
to
exult
in
the
discovery
he
have
make
,
and
,
like
a
true
flogger
,
actually
whipt
him
for
have
allow
Fathom
to
copy
his
exercise
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
in
the
hope
of
vindicate
his
own
penetration
,
he
take
an
opportunity
of
question
Ferdinand
in
private
,
concern
the
circumstance
of
the
translation
;
and
our
hero
perceive
his
drift
,
give
him
such
artful
and
ambiguous
answer
,
as
persuade
him
,
that
the
young
count
have
act
the
part
of
a
plagiary
,
and
that
the
other
have
be
restrain
from
do
himself
justice
,
by
the
consideration
of
his
own
dependance
.
    
<EOS>
this
profound
director
do
not
fail
,
in
honour
of
his
own
discernment
,
to
whisper
about
the
misrepresentation
,
as
an
instance
of
the
young
count
's
insolence
,
and
Fathom
's
humility
and
good
sense
.
 
<EOS>
the
story
be
circulate
among
the
servant
,
especially
the
maid
belong
to
the
family
,
whose
favour
our
hero
have
acquire
by
his
engage
behaviour
;
and
at
length
it
reach
the
ear
of
his
patron
,
who
,
incense
at
his
son
's
presumption
and
inhospitality
,
call
him
to
a
severe
account
,
when
the
young
gentleman
absolutely
deny
the
truth
of
the
allegation
,
and
appeal
to
the
evidence
of
Fathom
himself
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
be
accordingly
summon
by
the
father
,
and
encourage
to
declare
the
truth
,
with
an
assurance
of
his
constant
protection
;
upon
which
,
Ferdinand
very
wisely
fall
upon
his
knee
,
and
while
the
tear
gush
from
his
eye
,
acquit
the
young
count
of
the
imputation
and
express
his
apprehension
,
that
the
report
have
be
spread
by
some
of
his
enemy
,
who
want
to
prejudice
him
in
the
opinion
of
his
patron
.
    
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
be
not
satisfied
of
his
son
's
integrity
,
by
this
declaration
;
be
naturally
of
a
generous
disposition
,
highly
prepossess
in
favour
of
the
poor
orphan
,
and
chagrin
at
the
unpromising
appearance
of
his
heir
<EOS>
,
he
suspect
that
Fathom
be
over
-
awe
by
the
fear
of
give
offence
,
and
that
notwithstanding
what
he
have
say
,
the
case
really
stand
as
it
have
be
represent
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
persuasion
,
he
earnestly
exhort
his
son
to
resist
and
combat
with
any
impulse
he
may
feel
within
himself
,
tend
to
selfishness
,
fraud
or
imposition
;
to
encourage
every
sentiment
of
candor
and
benevolence
,
and
to
behave
with
moderation
and
affability
to
all
his
fellow
-
creature
.
 
<EOS>
He
lay
upon
him
strong
injunction
,
not
without
a
mixture
of
threat
,
to
consider
Fathom
as
the
object
of
his
peculiar
regard
;
to
respect
him
as
the
son
of
the
count
's
preserver
,
as
a
Briton
,
a
stranger
,
and
above
all
an
helpless
orphan
,
to
whom
the
right
of
hospitality
be
doubly
due
.
    
<EOS>
such
admonition
be
not
lose
upon
the
youth
,
who
under
the
rough
husk
of
his
personal
exhibition
,
possess
a
large
share
of
generous
sensibility
:
without
any
formal
profession
to
his
father
,
he
resolve
to
govern
himself
accord
to
his
remonstrance
;
and
far
from
conceive
the
least
spark
of
animosity
against
Fathom
,
he
look
upon
the
poor
boy
as
the
innocent
cause
of
his
disgrace
,
and
redouble
his
kindness
towards
him
,
that
his
honour
may
never
again
be
call
in
question
,
upon
the
same
subject
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
be
more
liable
to
misconstruction
than
an
act
of
uncommon
generosity
;
one
half
of
the
world
mistake
the
motive
,
from
want
of
idea
to
conceive
an
instance
of
beneficence
,
that
soar
so
high
above
the
level
of
their
own
sentiment
;
and
the
rest
suspect
it
of
something
sinister
or
selfish
,
from
the
suggestion
of
their
own
sordid
and
vicious
inclination
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
count
subject
himself
to
such
misinterpretation
,
among
those
who
observe
the
increase
warmth
of
civility
and
complaisance
in
his
behaviour
to
Ferdinand
:
they
ascribe
it
to
his
desire
of
still
profit
by
our
adventurer
's
superior
talent
,
by
which
alone
they
suppose
him
enable
to
maintain
any
degree
of
reputation
at
school
;
or
to
the
fear
of
be
convict
by
him
of
some
misdemeanour
of
which
he
know
himself
guilty
.
 
<EOS>
these
suspicion
be
not
efface
by
the
conduct
of
Ferdinand
,
who
,
when
examine
on
the
subject
,
manage
his
answer
in
such
a
manner
,
as
confirm
their
conjecture
,
while
he
pretend
to
refute
them
,
and
at
the
same
time
acquire
to
himself
credit
for
his
extraordinary
discretion
and
self
-
denial
.
    
<EOS>
if
he
exhibit
such
a
proof
of
sagacity
in
the
twelfth
year
of
his
age
,
what
may
not
be
expect
from
his
finesse
,
in
the
maturity
of
his
faculty
and
experience
?
 
<EOS>
thus
secure
in
the
good
grace
of
the
whole
family
,
he
see
the
day
of
his
puerility
glide
along
in
the
most
agreeable
elapse
of
caress
and
amusement
.
    
<EOS>
He
never
fairly
plunge
into
the
stream
of
school
education
;
but
,
by
float
on
the
surface
,
imbibe
a
small
tincture
of
those
different
science
,
which
his
master
pretend
to
teach
;
in
short
,
he
resemble
those
vagrant
swallow
that
skim
along
the
level
of
some
pool
or
river
,
without
venture
to
wet
one
feather
in
their
wing
,
except
in
the
accidental
pursuit
of
an
inconsiderable
fly
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
though
his
capacity
or
inclination
be
unsuite
for
study
of
this
kind
,
he
do
not
fail
to
manifest
a
perfect
genius
in
the
acquisition
of
other
more
profitable
art
.
 
<EOS>
over
and
above
the
accomplishment
of
address
,
for
which
he
hath
be
already
celebrate
,
he
excel
all
his
fellow
in
his
dexterity
at
five
and
billiard
;
be
altogether
unrivalled
in
his
skill
at
draught
and
backgammon
;
begin
,
even
at
these
year
,
to
understand
the
move
and
scheme
of
chess
;
and
make
himself
a
meer
adept
in
the
mystery
of
card
,
which
he
learn
in
the
course
of
his
assiduity
and
attention
to
the
female
of
the
house
.
     
<EOS>
He
meditate
scheme
of
importance
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
in
these
party
,
that
he
attract
the
notice
and
friendship
of
his
patron
's
daughter
,
a
girl
by
two
year
old
than
himself
,
who
be
not
insensible
to
his
qualification
,
and
look
upon
him
with
the
most
favourable
eye
of
prepossession
.
 
<EOS>
whether
or
not
he
at
this
period
of
his
life
begin
to
project
plan
for
avail
himself
of
her
susceptibility
,
be
uncertain
;
but
without
all
doubt
,
he
cultivate
her
esteem
with
as
obsequious
and
submissive
attention
,
as
if
he
have
already
form
the
design
,
which
,
in
his
advanced
age
,
he
attempt
to
put
in
execution
.
    
<EOS>
Divers
circumstance
conspire
to
promote
him
in
the
favour
of
this
young
lady
;
the
greenness
of
his
year
secure
him
from
any
suspicion
of
salacious
aim
;
so
that
he
be
indulge
in
frequent
opportunity
of
converse
with
his
young
mistress
,
whose
parent
encourage
this
communication
,
by
which
they
hope
she
would
improve
in
speak
the
language
of
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
such
connection
naturally
produce
intimacy
and
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
Fathom
's
person
be
agreeable
,
his
talent
calculate
for
the
meridian
of
those
party
,
and
his
manner
so
engage
,
that
there
would
have
be
no
just
subject
for
wonder
,
<EOS>
have
he
make
an
impression
upon
the
tender
unexperienced
heart
of
Mademoiselle
de
Mevil
,
whose
beauty
be
not
so
attractive
as
to
extinguish
his
hope
,
in
raise
up
a
number
of
formidable
rival
;
though
her
expectation
of
fortune
be
such
as
commonly
lend
additional
lustre
to
personal
merit
.
    
<EOS>
all
these
consideration
be
so
many
step
towards
the
success
of
Ferdinand
's
pretension
;
and
though
he
can
not
be
suppose
to
have
perceive
them
at
first
,
he
,
in
the
sequel
,
seem
perfectly
well
apprize
of
his
advantage
,
and
use
them
to
the
full
extent
of
his
faculty
.
 
<EOS>
observe
that
she
delight
in
music
,
he
betake
himself
to
the
study
of
that
art
,
and
by
dint
of
application
and
a
tolerable
ear
,
learn
of
himself
to
accompany
her
with
a
german
flute
,
while
she
sing
and
play
upon
the
harpsichord
.
    
<EOS>
the
count
see
his
inclination
,
and
the
progress
he
have
make
,
resolve
that
his
capacity
should
not
be
lose
for
want
of
cultivation
;
and
accordingly
provide
him
with
a
master
,
by
whom
he
be
instruct
in
the
principle
of
the
art
,
and
soon
become
a
proficient
in
play
upon
the
violin
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
practice
of
these
improvement
and
avocation
,
and
in
attendance
upon
his
young
master
,
whom
he
take
care
never
to
disoblige
or
neglect
,
he
attain
to
the
age
of
sixteen
,
without
feel
the
least
abatement
in
the
friendship
and
generosity
of
those
upon
whom
he
depend
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
receive
every
day
fresh
mark
of
their
bounty
and
regard
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
before
this
time
,
be
smit
with
the
ambition
of
make
a
conquest
of
the
young
lady
's
heart
;
and
foresaw
manifold
advantage
to
himself
,
in
become
son
-
in
-
law
to
count
Melvil
,
who
,
he
never
doubt
,
would
soon
be
reconcile
to
the
match
,
if
once
it
could
be
affectuate
without
his
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
although
he
think
he
have
great
reason
to
believe
that
Mademoiselle
look
upon
him
with
an
eye
of
peculiar
favour
,
his
disposition
be
happily
temper
with
an
ingredient
of
caution
,
that
hinder
him
from
act
with
precipitation
,
and
he
have
discern
in
the
young
lady
's
deportment
certain
indication
of
loftiness
and
pride
,
which
keep
him
in
the
utmost
vigilance
of
circumspection
;
for
,
he
know
that
by
a
premature
declaration
,
he
should
run
the
risque
of
forfeit
all
the
advantage
he
have
gain
,
and
blast
those
expectation
that
now
blossom
so
gaily
in
his
heart
.
    
<EOS>
restrict
by
these
reflection
,
he
act
at
a
wary
distance
,
and
determine
to
proceed
by
the
method
of
sap
,
and
summon
all
his
artifice
and
attraction
to
his
aid
,
employ
them
under
the
insidious
cover
of
profound
respect
in
order
to
undermine
those
bulwark
of
haughtiness
or
discretion
,
which
,
otherwise
,
may
have
render
his
approach
to
her
impracticable
.
 
<EOS>
with
a
view
to
enhance
the
value
of
his
company
,
and
sound
her
sentiment
at
the
same
time
,
he
become
more
reserved
than
usual
,
and
seldomer
engage
in
her
party
of
music
and
card
;
yet
in
the
midst
of
his
reserve
he
never
fail
in
those
demonstration
of
reverence
and
regard
,
which
he
know
perfectly
well
how
to
express
;
but
devise
such
excuse
for
his
absence
,
as
she
could
not
help
admit
.
 
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
affect
shyness
,
she
more
than
once
gently
chid
him
for
his
neglect
and
indifference
,
observe
,
with
an
ironicle
air
,
that
he
be
now
too
much
of
a
man
to
be
entertain
with
such
effeminate
diversion
;
but
her
reproofs
be
pronounce
with
too
much
ease
and
good
humour
to
be
agrecable
to
our
hero
,
who
desire
to
see
her
ruffle
and
chagrin
at
his
absence
,
and
to
hear
himself
rebuke
with
an
angry
affectation
of
disdain
.
 
<EOS>
this
effort
<EOS>
,
therefore
,
he
reinforce
with
the
most
captivating
carriage
he
could
assume
,
in
those
hour
which
he
now
so
sparingly
bestow
upon
his
mistress
;
he
regale
her
with
all
the
entertaining
story
he
could
learn
or
invent
,
particularly
such
as
he
think
would
justify
and
recommend
the
levelling
power
of
love
,
that
know
no
distinction
of
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
He
sing
nothing
but
tender
air
and
passionate
complaint
,
compose
by
despond
or
despair
swain
;
and
to
render
his
performance
of
this
kind
the
more
pathetic
,
interlard
them
with
some
seasonable
sigh
,
while
the
tear
which
he
have
ever
at
command
,
stand
collect
in
either
eye
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
her
to
overlook
such
studied
emotion
;
she
,
in
a
jocose
manner
,
tax
him
with
have
lose
his
heart
,
rally
the
excess
of
his
passion
,
and
in
a
merry
strain
undertake
to
be
an
advocate
for
his
love
.
 
<EOS>
Her
behaviour
be
still
wide
of
his
wish
and
expectation
:
he
think
she
would
,
in
consequence
of
her
discovery
,
have
betray
some
interested
symptom
;
that
her
face
would
have
undergo
some
favourable
suffusion
;
that
her
tongue
would
have
faultere
,
her
breast
heave
,
and
her
whole
deportment
betoken
internal
agitation
and
disorder
;
in
which
case
,
he
mean
to
profit
by
the
happy
impression
,
and
declare
himself
before
she
could
possibly
recollect
the
dictate
of
her
pride
.
 
<EOS>
Baffled
however
in
his
endeavour
,
by
the
serenity
of
the
young
lady
,
which
he
still
deem
equivocal
,
he
have
recourse
to
another
experiment
,
by
which
he
believe
,
he
should
make
a
discovery
of
her
sentiment
,
beyond
all
possibility
of
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
one
day
,
while
he
accompany
Mademoiselle
in
her
exercise
of
music
,
he
pretend
all
of
a
sudden
,
to
be
take
ill
,
and
counterfeit
a
swoon
in
her
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
surprise
at
this
accident
,
she
scream
aloud
,
but
far
from
run
to
his
assistance
,
with
the
transport
and
distraction
of
a
lover
,
she
order
her
maid
,
who
be
present
,
to
support
his
head
,
and
go
in
person
to
call
for
more
help
:
he
be
accordingly
remove
to
his
own
chamber
,
where
,
willing
to
be
still
more
certified
of
her
inclination
,
he
prolong
the
farce
,
and
lie
groan
under
the
pretence
of
a
severe
fever
.
    
<EOS>
the
whole
family
be
alarm
upon
this
occasion
;
for
as
we
have
already
observe
,
he
be
an
universal
favourite
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
immediately
visit
by
the
old
count
and
his
lady
,
who
express
the
utmost
concern
at
his
distemper
,
order
him
to
be
carefully
attend
,
and
send
for
a
physician
,
without
loss
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
would
scarce
stir
from
his
bed

have
an

<EOS>
He

the
usual

(
for
the

of

generally
as
well
skilled
in
the
art
of

as
any

in

his

unable
to
cope
with
two
such
formidable
antagonist
,
as
the
doctor

and
the
disease

have
conjure
up
,
be
no
sooner
rid
of
the
one
,
than
it
easily
get
the
well
of
the
other
;
and
though
Ferdinand
,
after
all
,
find
his
grand
aim
unaccomplishe
,
his
malady
be
productive
of
a
consequence
,
which
though
he
have
not
foresee
it
,
he
do
not
fail
to
convert
to
his
own
use
and
advantage
.
     
<EOS>
Engages
in
partnership
with
a
female
associate
,
in
order
to
put
his
talent
in
action
.
   
<EOS>
while
he
display
his
qualification
in
order
to
intrap
the
heart
of
his
young
mistress
,
he
have
unwittingly
enslave
the
affection
of
her
maid
.
 
<EOS>
this
attendant
be
also
a
favourite
of
the
young
lady
,
and
though
her
senior
by
two
or
three
good
year
at
least
,
unquestionably
her
superior
in
point
of
personal
beauty
;
she
moreover
possess
a
good
stock
of
cunning
and
discernment
,
and
be
furnish
by
nature
with
a
very
amorous
complexion
.
 
<EOS>
these
circumstance
be
premise
,
the
reader
will
not
be
surprised
to
find
her
smite
by
those
uncommon
qualification
which
we
have
celebrate
in
young
Fathom
.
    
<EOS>
She
have
in
good
sooth
,
long
sighed
in
secret
,
under
the
powerful
influence
of
his
charm
,
and
practise
upon
him
all
those
little
art
,
by
which
a
woman
strive
to
attract
the
admiration
,
and
ensnare
the
heart
of
a
man
she
love
;
but
all
his
faculty
be
employ
upon
the
plan
which
he
have
already
project
;
that
be
the
goal
of
his
whole
attention
,
to
which
all
his
measure
tend
;
and
whether
or
not
he
perceive
the
impression
he
have
make
upon
Teresa
,
he
never
give
her
the
least
reason
to
believe
he
be
conscious
of
his
victory
,
until
he
find
himself
baffle
in
his
design
upon
the
heart
of
her
mistress
.
 
<EOS>
She
therefore
persevere
in
her
distant
attempt
to
allure
him
,
with
the
usual
coquetry
of
dress
and
address
,
and
in
the
sweet
hope
of
profit
by
his
susceptibility
,
make
shift
to
suppress
her
feeling
,
and
keep
her
passion
within
bound
;
until
his
suppose
danger
alarm
her
fear
,
and
raise
such
a
tumult
within
her
breast
,
that
she
could
no
longer
conceal
her
love
,
but
give
a
loose
to
her
sorrow
in
the
most
immoderate
expression
of
anguish
and
affliction
,
and
while
his
delirium
last
,
behave
with
all
the
agitation
of
a
despairing
shepherdess
.
    
<EOS>
Ferdinand
be
,
or
pretend
to
be
,
the
last
person
in
the
family
,
who
understand
the
situation
of
her
thought
;
when
he
perceive
her
passion
,
he
enter
into
deliberation
with
himself
,
and
task
her
reflection
and
foresight
,
in
order
to
discover
how
good
he
may
convert
this
conquest
to
his
own
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
here
then
,
that
we
may
neglect
no
opportunity
of
do
justice
to
our
hero
,
it
will
be
proper
to
observe
,
that
howsoever
unapt
his
understanding
may
be
to
receive
and
retain
the
usual
culture
of
the
school
,
he
be
naturally
a
genius
self
-
teach
,
in
point
of
sagacity
and
invention
.
    
<EOS>
He
dive
into
the
character
of
mankind
,
with
a
penetration
peculiar
to
himself
,
and
have
he
be
admit
as
a
pupil
in
any
political
academy
,
would
have
certainly
become
one
of
the
able
statesman
in
Europe
.
    
<EOS>
have
revolve
all
the
probable
consequence
of
such
a
connection
;
he
determine
to
prosecute
an
amour
with
the
lady
whose
affection
he
have
subdue
;
because
he
hope
to
interest
her
as
an
auxiliary
in
his
grand
scheme
upon
Mademoiselle
,
which
he
do
not
as
yet
think
proper
to
lay
aside
;
for
he
be
not
more
ambitious
in
the
plan
,
than
indefatigable
in
the
prosecution
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
it
would
be
impossible
to
execute
his
aim
upon
the
count
's
daughter
,
under
the
eye
of
Teresa
,
whose
natural
discernment
would
be
whet
with
jealousy
,
and
who
would
watch
his
conduct
,
and
thwart
his
progress
with
all
the
vigilance
and
spite
of
a
slight
maiden
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
he
do
not
doubt
of
be
able
to
bring
her
over
to
his
interest
,
by
the
influence
he
have
already
gain
,
or
may
afterwards
acquire
over
her
passion
;
in
which
case
,
she
would
effectually
espouse
his
cause
,
and
employ
her
good
office
with
her
mistress
,
in
his
behalf
:
besides
,
he
be
induce
by
another
motive
,
which
though
secondary
,
do
not
fail
in
this
case
to
have
an
effect
upon
his
determination
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
upon
Teresa
with
the
eye
of
appetite
,
which
he
long
to
gratify
:
<EOS>
for
he
be
not
at
all
dead
to
the
instigation
of
the
flesh
,
though
he
have
philosophy
enough
to
resist
them
,
when
he
think
they
interfere
with
his
interest
.
    
<EOS>
here
the
case
be
quite
different
:
his
desire
happen
to
be
upon
the
side
of
his
advantage
,
and
therefore
,
resolve
to
indulge
it
,
he
no
sooner
find
himself
in
a
condition
to
manage
such
an
adventure
,
than
he
begin
to
make
gradual
advance
in
point
of
warmth
and
particular
complacency
to
the
love
-
sick
maid
.
    
<EOS>
He
first
of
all
,
thank
her
in
the
most
grateful
term
,
for
the
concern
she
have
manifest
at
his
distemper
,
and
the
kind
service
he
have
receive
from
her
,
during
the
course
of
it
;
he
treat
her
upon
all
occasion
,
with
unusual
affability
and
regard
,
assiduously
court
her
acquaintance
and
conversation
,
and
contract
an
intimacy
that
,
in
a
little
time
,
produce
a
declaration
of
love
.
 
<EOS>
although
her
heart
be
too
much
intendere
to
hold
out
against
all
the
form
of
assault
,
far
from
yield
at
discretion
,
she
stand
upon
honourable
term
,
with
great
obstinacy
of
punctilio
,
and
while
she
own
he
be
master
of
her
inclination
,
give
him
to
understand
,
with
a
peremptory
and
resolute
air
,
that
he
should
never
make
a
conquest
of
her
virtue
:
observe
,
that
if
the
passion
he
profess
be
genuine
,
he
would
not
scruple
to
give
such
a
proof
of
it
,
as
would
at
once
convince
her
of
his
sincerity
;
and
that
he
could
have
no
just
cause
to
refuse
her
that
satisfaction
,
she
be
his
equal
in
point
of
birth
and
situation
:
for
,
if
he
be
the
companion
and
favourite
of
the
young
count
,
she
be
the
friend
and
confidante
of
Mademoiselle
.
    
<EOS>
He
acknowledge
the
strength
of
her
argument
,
and
that
her
condescension
be
great
than
his
desert
;
but
object
against
the
proposal
,
as
infinitely
prejudicial
to
the
fortune
of
them
both
.
    
<EOS>
He
represent
the
state
of
dependance
in
which
they
mutually
stand
;
their
utter
incapacity
to
support
one
another
,
under
the
consequence
of
a
precipitate
match
,
clandestinely
make
without
the
consent
and
concurrence
of
their
patron
:
he
display
,
with
great
eloquence
,
all
those
gay
expectation
they
have
reason
to
entertain
,
from
that
eminent
degree
of
favour
which
they
have
already
secure
in
the
family
;
and
set
forth
,
in
the
most
alluring
colour
,
those
enchant
scene
of
pleasure
they
may
enjoy
,
in
each
other
,
without
that
disagreeable
consciousness
of
a
nuptial
chain
,
<EOS>
provide
she
would
be
his
associate
in
the
execution
of
a
plan
,
which
he
have
project
for
their
reciprocal
convenience
.
    
<EOS>
have
thus
inflame
her
love
of
pleasure
and
curiosity
,
he
,
with
great
caution
,
hint
his
design
upon
the
young
lady
's
fortune
,
and
perceive
her
listening
with
the
most
greedy
attention
,
and
perfectly
ripe
for
the
conspiracy
,
be
disclose
his
intention
at
full
length
,
assure
her
,
with
the
most
solemn
protestation
of
love
and
attachment
,
that
could
he
once
make
himself
legal
possessor
of
an
estate
which
Mademoiselle
inherit
,
by
the
will
of
a
deceased
aunt
,
his
dear
Teresa
should
reap
the
happy
fruit
of
his
affluence
;
and
wholly
engross
his
time
and
attention
,
    
such
a
base
declaration
our
hero
would
not
have
venture
to
make
,
have
he
not
implicitly
believe
the
damsel
be
as
great
a
latitudinarian
as
himself
in
point
of
moral
and
principle
;
and
be
well
assure
,
that
though
he
should
be
mistake
in
her
way
of
thinking
,
so
far
as
to
be
threatne
with
a
detection
of
his
purpose
,
he
would
always
have
it
in
his
power
to
refute
her
accusation
as
meer
calumny
,
by
the
character
he
have
<EOS>
hitherto
maintain
,
and
the
circumspection
of
his
future
conduct
.
    
<EOS>
He
seldom
or
never
err
in
his
observation
on
the
human
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Teresa
,
instead
of
disapproving
,
relish
the
plan
in
general
,
with
demonstration
of
singular
satisfaction
:
<EOS>
she
,
at
once
conceive
all
the
advantageous
consequence
of
such
a
scheme
,
and
perceive
in
it
only
one
flaw
,
which
,
however
,
she
do
not
think
incurable
.
 
<EOS>
this
defect
be
no
other
than
a
sufficient
bond
of
union
,
by
which
they
may
be
effectually
tie
down
to
their
mutual
interest
.
 
<EOS>
She
foresee
,
that
in
case
Ferdinand
should
obtain
possession
of
the
prize
,
he
may
,
with
great
ease
,
deny
their
contract
,
and
disavow
her
claim
of
participation
.
 
<EOS>
She
therefore
demand
security
,
and
propose
,
as
a
preliminary
of
the
agreement
,
that
he
should
privately
take
her
to
wife
,
with
a
view
to
despell
all
her
apprehension
of
his
inconstancy
or
deceit
,
as
such
a
previous
engagement
would
be
a
check
upon
his
behaviour
,
and
keep
him
strictly
to
the
letter
of
their
contract
.
    
<EOS>
He
could
not
help
subscribe
to
the
righteousness
of
this
proposal
,
which
,
nevertheless
,
he
would
have
willingly
wave
,
on
the
supposition
that
they
could
not
possibly
be
join
in
the
band
of
wedlock
,
with
such
secrecy
as
the
nature
of
the
case
absolutely
require
.
    
<EOS>
this
would
have
be
a
difficulty
soon
remove
,
have
the
scene
of
the
transaction
be
lay
in
the
metropolis
of
England
,
where
passenger
be
ply
in
the
street
by
clergyman
,
who
prostitute
their
character
and
conscience
for
hire
,
in
defiance
of
all
decency
and
law
;
but
in
the
kingdom
of
Hungary
,
ecclesiastic
be
more
scrupulous
in
the
exercise
of
their
function
,
and
the
objection
be
,
or
suppose
to
be
altogether
insurmountable
;
so
that
they
be
fain
to
have
recourse
to
an
expedient
,
with
which
,
after
some
hesitation
,
our
she
-
adventurer
be
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
They
join
hand
in
the
sight
of
Heaven
,
which
they
call
to
witness
,
and
to
judge
the
sincerity
of
their
vow
,
and
engage
in
a
voluntary
oath
to
confirm
their
union
by
the
sanction
of
the
church
,
whenever
a
convenient
opportunity
for
so
do
,
should
occur
.
    
<EOS>
the
scruple
of
Teresa
be
thus
remove
,
she
admit
Ferdinand
to
the
privilege
of
a
husband
,
which
he
enjoy
in
steal
interview
;
and
readily
undertake
to
exert
her
whole
power
in
promote
his
suit
with
her
young
mistress
,
because
she
now
consider
his
interest
as
inseparably
connect
with
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
surely
nothing
could
be
more
absurd
or
preposterous
,
than
the
article
of
this
covenant
,
which
she
insist
upon
with
such
inflexibility
.
 
<EOS>
how
could
she
suppose
,
that
her
pretended
lover
would
be
restrain
by
an
oath
,
when
the
very
occasion
of
incur
it
,
be
an
intention
to
act
in
violation
of
all
law
human
and
divine
;
and
yet
such
ridiculous
conjuration
be
commonly
the
cement
of
every
conspiracy
,
how
dark
,
how
treacherous
,
how
impious
soever
it
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
a
certain
sign
that
there
be
some
remain
of
religion
leave
in
the
human
mind
,
even
after
every
moral
sentiment
hath
abandon
it
;
and
that
the
most
execrable
ruffian
find
mean
to
quiet
the
suggestion
of
his
conscience
,
by
some
reversionary
hope
of
heaven
's
forgiveness
.
     
<EOS>
Their
first
attempt
:
with
a
digression
which
some
reader
may
think
impertinent
.
   
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
will
,
our
lover
,
though
real
voluptuary
,
amidst
the
first
transport
of
their
enjoyment
,
do
not
neglect
the
great
political
aim
of
their
conjunction
.
 
<EOS>
Teresa
's
bed
-
chamber
,
to
which
our
hero
constantly
repair
at
midnight
,
be
the
scene
of
their
deliberation
,
and
there
it
be
determine
,
that
the
damsel
,
in
order
to
avoid
suspicion
,
should
feign
herself
irritated
at
the
indifference
of
Ferdinand
,
<EOS>
her
passion
for
whom
be
,
by
this
time
,
no
secret
in
the
family

and
that
with
a
view
to
countenance
this
affectation
,
he
should
upon
all
occasion
treat
her
with
an
air
of
loftiness
and
disdain
.
    
<EOS>
so
screen
from
all
imputation
of
fraud
,
she
be
furnish
by
him
with
artful
instruction
,
how
to
sound
the
inclination
of
her
young
mistress
;
how
to
recommend
his
person
and
qualification
by
the
sure
method
of
contradiction
,
comparison
,
reviling
and
reproach
;
how
to
watch
the
paroxysm
of
her
disposition
,
inflame
her
passion
,
and
improve
,
for
his
advantage
,
those
moment
of
frailty
,
from
which
no

be
exempt
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
this
consummate
politician
teach
his
agent
to
poison
the
young
lady
's
mind
with
insidious
conversation
,
tend
to
inspire
her
with
the
love
of
guilty
pleasure
,
to
debauch
her
sentiment
,
and
confound
her
idea
of
dignity
and
virtue
.
    
<EOS>
after
all
,
the
task
be
not
difficult
to
lead
the
unpractised
heart
astray
,
by
dint
of
those
opportunity
her
seducer
possess
.
 
<EOS>
the
seed
of
insinuation
,
seasonably
sow
upon
the
warm
luxuriant
soil
of
youth
,
could
hardly
fail
of
shoot
up
into
such
intemperate
desire
as
he
want
to
produce
;
especially
when
cultured
and
cherish
in
her
unguarded
hour
,
by
that
stimulate
discourse
which
familiarity
admit
,
and
the
loose
passion
ingraft
in
every
breast
,
be
apt
to
relish
and
excuse
.
    
<EOS>
Fathom
have
previously
reconnoitre
the
ground
,
and
discover
some
mark
of
inflammability
in
Mademoiselle
's
constitution
;
her
beauty
be
not
such
as
to
engage
her
in
those
gaiety
of
amusement
,
which
could
flatter
her
vanity
,
and
dissipate
her
idea
;
and
she
be
of
an
age
,
when
the
little
love
and
young
desire
take
possession
of
the
fancy
;
he
therefore
conclude
,
that
she
have
the
more
leisure
to
indulge
those
intice
image
of
pleasure
that
youth
never
fail
to
create
,
particularly
in
those
who
,
like
her
,
be
addict
to
solitude
and
study
.
    
<EOS>
Teresa
,
full
fraught
with
the
wily
injunction
of
her
confederate
,
take
the
field
,
and
open
the
compaign
with
such
remakable
sourness
in
her
aspect
,
when
Ferdinand
appear
,
that
her
young
lady
could
not
help
take
notice
of
her
affected
chagrin
,
and
ask
the
reason
of
such
apparent
alteration
in
her
way
of
thinking
.
    
<EOS>
prepare
for
this
question
,
the
other
reply
in
a
manner
calculate
for
give
Mademoiselle
to
understand
,
that
whatever
impression
Ferdinand
may
have
formerly
make
on
her
heart
<EOS>
,
they
be
now
altogether
efface
by
the
pride
and
insolence
with
which
he
have
receive
her
advance
;
and
that
her
breast
now
glow
with
all
the
revenge
of
a
slighted
lover
.
    
<EOS>
to
evince
the
sincerity
of
this
declaration
,
she
bitterly
inveigh
against
him
,
and
even
affected
to
depreciate
those
talent
,
in
which
she
know
his
chief
merit
to
consist
;
hope
by
these
mean
to
interest
Mademoiselle
's
candour
in
his
defence
.
 
<EOS>
so
far
the
train
succeed
:
that
the
young
lady
's
natural
love
for
truth
be
offend
at
the
calumny
that
be
vent
against
Ferdinand
in
his
absence
.
 
<EOS>
She
chide
her
woman
for
the
rancour
of
her
remark
,
and
undertake
to
refute
the
article
of
his
dispraise
:
 
<EOS>
Teresa
support
her
own
assertion
with
great
obstinacy
,
and
a
dispute
ensue
,
in
which
her
mistress
be
heat
into
some
extravagant
commendation
of
our
adventurer
.
    
<EOS>
His
suppose
enemy
do
not
fail
to
make
a
report
of
her
success
,
and
to
magnify
every
advantage
they
have
gain
;
believe
in
good
earnest
,
that
her
lady
's
warmth
be
the
effect
of
a
real
passion
for
the
fortunate
Mr
Fathom
:
but
he
himself
view
the
adventure
in
a
different
light
;
and
rightly
impute
the
violence
of
Mademoiselle
's
behaviour
to
the
contradiction
she
have
sustain
from
her
maid
;
or
to
the
fire
of
her
natural
generosity
,
glow
in
behalf
of
innocence
traduce
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
be
perfectly
well
pleased
with
the
nature
of
the
contest
;
because
,
in
the
course
of
such
debate
,
he
foresee
that
he
should
become
habitually
her
hero
,
and
that
,
in
time
,
she
would
actually
believe
those
exaggeration
of
his
merit
,
which
she
herself
have
feign
for
the
honour
of
her
own
argument
.
    
<EOS>
this
presage
,
found
upon
that
principle
of
self
respect
,
without
which
no
individual
exist
,
may
certainly
be
justify
by
manifold
occurrence
in
life
:
we
ourselves
have
know
a
very
pregnant
example
,
which
we
shall
relate
,
for
the
emolument
of
the
reader
.
 
<EOS>
a
certain
needy
author
have
find
mean
to
present
a
manuscript
to
one
of
those
son
of
fortune
,
who
be
dignified
with
the
appellation
of
patron
,
instead
of
reap
that
applause
,
and
advantage
,
with
which
he
have
regale
his
fancy
,
have
the
mortification
to
find
his
performance
treat
with
infinite
irreverence
and
contempt
;
and
in
high
dudgeon
and
disappointment
appeal
to
the
judgment
of
another
critic
,
who
,
he
know
,
have
no
veneration
for
the
first
.
    
<EOS>
this
common
consolation
,
to
which
all
baffle
author
have
recourse
,
be
productive
of
very
happy
consequence
to
our
bard
:
for
tho
'
the
opinion
of
both
judge
,
concern
the
piece
,
be
altogether
the
same
,
the
latter
,
either
out
of
compassion
to
the
appellant
,
or
desire
of
render
his
rival
ridiculous
in
the
eye
of
taste
,
undertake
to
repair
the
misfortune
,
and
in
this
manner
execute
the
plan
,
in
a
meeting
of
literati
,
to
which
both
these
with
belong
;
he
who
have
espouse
the
poet
's
cause
,
have
previously
desire
another
member
to
bring
his
composition
on
the
carpet
,
no
sooner
hear
it
mention
than
he
begin
to
censure
it
with
flagrant
mark
of
scorn
,
and
with
an
ironical
air
look
at
its
first
condemner
,
observe
that
he
must
be
furiously
infect
with
the
rage
of
patronizing
,
who
could
take
such
a
deplorable
performance
into
his
protection
:
 
<EOS>
the
sarcasm
take
effect
.
    
<EOS>
the
person
against
whom
it
be
level
take
umbrage
at
his
presumption
,
assume
an
aspect
of
disdain
,
and
reply
with
great
animosity
,
that
nothing
be
more
easily
support
than
the
character
of
a
Zoilus
,
because
no
production
be
altogether
free
from
blemish
,
and
any
man
may
pronounce
against
any
piece
by
the
lump
,
without
interesting
his
own
discernment
:
but
to
perceive
the
beauty
of
a
work
,
it
be
requisite
to
have
learning
,
judgment
and
taste
;
and
therefore
he
do
not
wonder
that
the
gentleman
have
overlook
a
great
many
in
the
composition
which
he
so
contemptuously
decry
.
 
<EOS>
a
rejoinder
succeed
this
reply
,
and
produce
a
long
train
of
altercation
,
in
which
the
gentleman
who
have
formerly
treat
the
book
with
such
disrespect
,
now
profess
himself
its
passionate
admirer
,
and
hold
forth
in
praise
of
it
with
great
warmth
and
elocution
.
    
<EOS>
not
content
with
have
exhibit
this
instance
of
regard
,
he
next
morning
send
a
message
to
the
owner
,
importing
,
that
he
have
but
superficially
glance
over
the
manuscript
,
and
desire
the
favour
of
peruse
it
a
second
time
;
be
indulge
in
this
request
,
he
recommend
it
,
in
term
of
rapture
,
to
all
his
friend
and
dependant
,
and
by
dint
of
unwearied
solicitation
,
procure
a
very
ample
subscription
for
the
author
.
    
<EOS>
but
,
to
resume
the
thread
of
our
story
:
 
Teresa
's
practice
be
not
confine
to
simple
defamation
:
her
reproach
be
contrive
so
as
to
imply
some
intelligence
in
favour
of
the
person
she
revile
.
    
<EOS>
in
exemplify
his
pertness
and
arrogance
,
she
repeat
his
witty
repartee
;
on
pretence
of
blame
his
ferocity
,
she
recount
proof
of
his
spirit
and
prowess
;
and
in
explain
the
source
of
his
vanity
,
give
her
mistress
to
understand
,
that
a
certain
young
lady
of
fashion
be
say
to
be
enamour
of
his
person
.
 
<EOS>
nor
do
this
well
-
instruct
understrapper
omit
those
other
part
of
her
cue
,
which
the
principal
judge
necessary
for
the
furtherance
of
his
scheme
.
 
<EOS>
Her
conversation
become
less
guarded
,
and
take
a
free
turn
than
usual
:
she
seize
all
opportunity
of
introduce
little
amorous
story
,
the
great
part
of
which
be
invent
for
the
purpose
of
warm
her
passion
,
and
lower
the
price
of
chastity
in
her
esteem
;
for
she
represent
all
the
young
lady
's
co
-
temporary
in
point
of
age
and
situation
,
as
so
many
sensualist
,
who
without
scruple
indulge
themselves
in
the
steal
pleasure
of
youth
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
while
Ferdinand
second
these
endeavour
with
his
whole
industry
and
address
:
he
redouble
,
if
possible
,
his
deference
and
respect
;
whet
his
assiduity
to
the
keen
edge
of
attention
;
and
in
short
,
regulate
his
dress
,
conversation
and
deportment
,
accord
to
the
fancy
,
turn
,
and
prevail
humour
of
his
young
mistress
.
    
<EOS>
He
moreover
attempt
to
profit
by
her
curiosity
,
which
he
know
to
be
truly
feminine
,
and
have
cull
from
the
library
of
his
patron
,
certain
dangerous
book
,
calculate
to
debauch
the
mind
of
young
people
,
leave
them
occasionally
upon
the
table
,
in
his
apartment
,
after
have
direct
Teresa
to
pick
them
up
,
as
if
by
accident
,
in
his
absence
,
and
carry
them
off
for
the
entertainment
of
Mademoiselle
;
nay
,
this
crafty
projector
find
mean
to
furnish
his
associate
with
some
mischievous
preparation
,
which
be
mingle
in
her
chocolate
,
tea
or
coffee
,
as
povocation
to
warm
her
constitution
:
yet
all
these
machination
,
ingenious
as
they
be
,
fail
,
not
only
in
fulfil
their
aim
,
but
even
in
shake
the
foundation
of
her
virtue
or
pride
,
which
stand
their
assault
;
unmove
,
like
a
strong
tower
build
upon
a
rock
,
impregnable
to
all
the
tempestuous
blast
of
heaven
.
    
<EOS>
not
but
that
the
conspirator
be
more
than
once
mistake
in
the
effect
of
their
artifice
,
and
dispose
to
applaud
themselves
on
the
progress
they
have
make
.
 
<EOS>
when
at
any
time
she
express
a
desire
to
examine
those
performance
which
be
lay
before
her
as
snare
to
entrap
her
chastity
,
they
attribute
that
,
which
be
no
other
than
curiosity
,
to
a
looseness
of
sentiment
;
and
when
she
discover
no
aversion
to
hear
those
anecdote
concern
the
frailty
of
her
neighbour
,
they
impute
to
abatement
of
chastity
,
that
satisfaction
which
be
the
result
of
self
-
congratulation
on
her
own
superior
virtue
.
    
<EOS>
so
far
do
the
treacherous
accomplice
of
Fathom
presume
upon
these
misconstruction
,
that
she
at
length
divest
her
tongue
of
all
restraint
,
and
behave
in
such
a
manner
,
that
the
young
lady
,
confound
and
incense
at
her
indecency
and
impudence
,
rebuke
her
with
great
severity
,
and
command
her
to
reform
her
discourse
,
on
pain
of
be
dismiss
with
disgrace
from
her
service
.
     
<EOS>
the
confederate
change
their
battery
;
and
atchieve
a
remarkable
adventure
.
   
<EOS>
Thunderstruck
at
this
disappointment
,
the
confederate
hold
a
council
,
in
order
to
deliberate
upon
the
next
measure
that
should
be
take
;
and
Ferdinand
for
the
present
,
despair
of
accomplish
his
grand
aim
,
resolve
to
profit
in
another
manner
,
by
the
conveniency
of
his
situation
.
 
<EOS>
He
represent
to
his
helpmate
,
that
it
would
be
prudent
for
them
to
make
hay
while
the
sun
shine
,
as
their
connection
may
be
sooner
or
later
discover
,
and
an
end
put
to
all
those
opportunity
which
they
now
so
happily
enjoy
.
 
<EOS>
all
principle
of
morality
have
be
already
exclude
from
their
former
plan
;
consequently
,
he
find
it
an
easy
task
to
interest
Teresa
in
any
other
scheme
tend
to
their
mutual
advantage
,
howsoever
wicked
and
perfidious
it
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
persuade
her
to
be
his
auxiliary
in
defraud
Mademoiselle
at
play
,
and
give
her
suitable
direction
for
that
purpose
;
and
even
tutor
her
how
to
abuse
the
trust
repose
in
her
,
by
embezzle
the
young
lady
's
effect
,
without
incur
the
suspicion
of
dishonesty
.
    
<EOS>
on
the
supposition
that
every
servant
in
the
house
,
be
not
able
to
resist
such
temptation
,
the
purse
of
her
mistress
(
to
which
the
maid
have
always
access
)
be
drop
in
a
passage
,
which
the
domestic
have
occasion
to
frequent
,
and
Fathom
post
himself
in
a
convenient
place
,
in
order
to
observe
the
effect
of
his
stratagem
.
 
<EOS>
here
he
be
not
disappoint
in
his
conjecture
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
person
who
chance
to
pass
that
way
,
be
one
of
the
chambermaid
,
with
whom
Teresa
have
live
,
for
some
time
,
in
a
state
of
inveterate
enmity
,
because
the
wench
have
fail
in
that
homage
and
respect
which
be
pay
to
her
by
the
rest
of
the
servant
.
    
<EOS>
Ferdinand
have
in
his
heart
espouse
the
quarrel
of
his
associate
,
and
long
for
an
occasion
to
deliver
her
from
the
malicious
observance
of
such
an
antagonist
;
when
he
therefore
see
her
approach
,
his
heart
throb
with
joyful
expectation
;
but
when
she
snatch
up
the
purse
,
and
thrust
it
in
her
bosom
,
with
all
the
eagerness
and
confusion
of
one
determine
to
appropriate
the
windfall
to
her
own
use
,
his
transport
be
altogether
unspeakable
.
 
<EOS>
He
trace
her
to
her
own
apartment
,
whither
she
immediately
retreat
with
great
trepidation
,
and
then
communicate
the
discovery
to
Teresa
,
together
with
instruction
how
to
behave
in
the
sequel
.
    
<EOS>
in
conformity
with
these
lesson
,
she
take
the
first
opportunity
of
go
to
Mademoiselle
,
and
demand
money
,
for
some
necessary
expence
,
that
the
loss
may
be
know
,
before
the
finder
could
have
leisure
to
make
any
fresh
conveyance
of
the
prize
;
and
in
the
mean
time
Ferdinand
keep
a
strict
eye
upon
the
motion
of
the
chambermaid
.
    
<EOS>
the
young
lady
have
rummage
her
pocket
in
vain
,
express
some
surprize
at
the
loss
of
her
purse
,
upon
which
her
attendant
give
indication
of
extreme
amazement
and
concern
;
she
say
,
it
could
not
possibly
be
lose
;
intreate
her
to
search
her
escrutore
,
while
she
herself
run
about
the
room
,
pry
into
every
corner
,
with
all
the
symptom
of
fear
and
distraction
.
 
<EOS>
have
make
this
unsuccessful
inquiry
,
she
pretend
to
shed
a
flood
of
tear
,
bewail
her
own
fate
,
in
be
near
the
person
of
any
lady
,
who
meet
with
such
a
misfortune
,
by
which
,
she
observe
,
her
character
may
be
call
in
question
:
she
produce
her
own
key
,
and
beg
upon
her
knee
,
that
her
chamber
and
box
may
be
search
without
delay
.
    
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
she
demean
herself
so
artfully
,
upon
this
occasion
,
that
her
mistress
,
who
never
entertain
the
least
doubt
of
her
integrity
,
now
look
upon
her
as
a
miracle
of
fidelity
and
attachment
,
and
be
at
infinite
pain
to
console
her
for
the
accident
which
have
happen
;
protest
,
that
,
for
her
own
part
,
the
loss
of
the
money
should
never
affect
her
with
a
moment
's
uneasiness
,
if
she
could
retrieve
a
certain
medal
which
she
have
long
keep
in
her
purse
,
as
a
remembrance
of
her
deceased
aunt
,
from
whom
she
receive
it
in
a
present
.

before

have

him
acquaint
with

his

exclaim
in

"
Mr
Fathom
,
my
lady
have
lose

purse
;
and
as
no
person
in
the
family
be
so
much
about
her
,
as
you
and
I
,
you
must
give
me
leave

in

own
justification

to
insist
upon
Mademoiselle
's
order
the
apartment
of
us
both
to
be
search
without
loss
of
time
:
here
be
my
pocket
and
my
key
,
and
you
can
not
scruple
to
give
her
the
same
satisfaction
;
for
innocence
have
nothing
to
fear
.
"
    
<EOS>
Miss
Melvil
reprimand
her
sharply
for
her
unmannerly
zeal
;
and
Ferdinand
eye
her
with
a
look
of
disdain
,
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
say
he
,
I
approve
of
your
proposal
;
but
before
I
undergo
such
mortification
,
I
would
advise
Mademoiselle
to
subject
the
two
chambermaid
to
such
inquiry
:
as
they
also
have
access
to
the
apartment
,
and
be
,
<EOS>
I
apprehend
,
as
likely
as
you
or
I
,
to
behave
in
such
a
scandalous
manner
.
    
<EOS>
the
young
lady
declare
that
she
be
too
well
satisfied
of
Teresa
's
honesty
and
Ferdinand
's
honour
,
to
harbour
the
least
suspicion
of
either
,
and
that
she
would
sooner
die
than
disgrace
them
so
far
as
to
comply
with
the
proposal
the
former
have
make
;
but
as
she
see
no
reason
for
exempt
the
inferior
servant
from
that
examination
which
Fathom
advise
,
she
would
forthwith
put
it
in
execution
.
 
<EOS>
the
chambermaid
be
accordingly
summon
,
she
calmly
ask
,
if
either
of
them
have
accidentally
find
the
purse
she
have
drop
;
and
both
reply
in
the
negative
,
she
assume
an
air
of
severity
and
determination
,
and
demand
their
key
,
threatne
to
examine
their
trunk
on
the
instant
.
    
<EOS>
the
guilty
Abigail
,
who
,
though
an
Hungarian
,
be
not
inferior
,
in
point
of
effrontery
,
to
any
one
of
the
sisterhood
in
England
,
no
sooner
hear
this
menace
,
than
she
affect
an
air
of
affront
innocence
,
thank
God
she
have
live
in
many
reputable
family
,
and
be
trust
with
untold
gold
;
but
be
never
before
suspect
of
theft
;
that
the
other
maid
may
do
as
she
should
think
proper
,
and
be
mean
spirit
enough
to
let
her
thing
be
tumble
topsy
-
turvy
and
expose
;
but
,
for
her
own
part
,
if
she
should
be
use
in
that
inhuman
and
digraceful
manner
,
she
would
not
stay
another
hour
in
the
house
;
and
in
conclusion
say
,
that
Mademoiselle
have
more
reason
to
look
sharp
after
those
who
enjoy
the
great
share
of
her
favour
,
than
believe
their
malicious
insinuation
against
innocent
people
whom
they
be
well
known
to
hate
and
defame
.
    
<EOS>
this
declaration
imply
an
hint
to
the
prejudice
of
Teresa
,
far
from
divert
miss
Melvile
from
her
purpose
,
serve
only
to
inhance
,
the
character
of
the
accuse
in
her
opinion
,
and
to
confirm
her
suspicion
of
the
accuser
,
of
whom
she
again
demand
her
key
,
protest
<EOS>
,
that
should
she
prove
refractory
,
the
count
himself
should
take
cognizance
of
the
affair
;
whereas
if
she
would
deal
ingenuously
,
she
should
have
no
cause
to
repent
of
her
confession
.
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
she
desire
our
adventurer
to
take
the
trouble
of
call
up
some
of
the
man
servant
;
upon
which
the
conscious
criminal
begin
to
tremble
,
and
fall
upon
her
knee
,
acknowledge
her
guilt
,
and
implore
the
forgiveness
of
her
young
mistress
.
    
<EOS>
Teresa
seize
this
occasion
to
signalize
her
generosity
,
join
in
the
request
,
and
the
offender
be
pardon
,
after
have
restore
the
purse
,
and
promise
in
the
sight
of
Heaven
,
that
the
devil
should
never
again
entice
her
to
the
commission
of
such
a
crime
.
    
<EOS>
this
adventure
fully
answer
all
the
purpose
of
our
politician
;
it
establish
the
opinion
of
his
fellow
labourer
's
virtue
,
beyond
the
power
of
accident
or
information
to
shake
,
and
set
up
a
false
beacon
to
mislead
the
sentiment
of
Mademoiselle
,
in
case
she
should
for
the
future
meet
with
the
like
misfortune
.
     
<EOS>
They
proceed
to
levy
contribution
with
great
success
,
until
our
hero
set
out
with
the
young
count
for
Vienna
,
where
he
enter
into
league
with
another
adventurer
.
   
<EOS>
under
this
secure
cover
,
Teresa
levy
contribution
upon
her
mistress
with
great
success
.
 
<EOS>
some
trinket
be
miss
every
day
;
the
young
lady
's
patience
begin
to
fall
,
the
faithful
attendant
be
overwhelmed
with
consternation
,
and
with
the
appearance
of
extreme
chagrin
,
demand
her
dismission
,
affirm
that
these
thing
be
certainly
effect
by
some
person
in
the
family
,
with
a
view
of
murthere
her
precious
reputation
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Melvile
,
not
without
difficulty
,
quiet
her
vexation
with
assurance
of
inviolable
confidence
and
esteem
,
until
a
pair
of
diamond
ear
-
ring
vanish
,
when
Teresa
could
no
longer
keep
her
affliction
within
bound
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
this
be
an
event
of
more
consequence
,
than
all
the
rest
which
have
happen
,
for
the
jewel
be
value
at
five
hundred
florin
.
    
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
be
accordingly
alarm
to
such
a
degree
,
that
she
make
her
mother
acquaint
with
her
loss
,
and
that
good
lady
,
who
be
an
excellent
oeconomist
,
do
not
fail
to
give
indication
of
extraordinary
concern
.
    
<EOS>
She
ask
,
if
her
daughter
have
reason
to
suspect
any
individual
in
the
family
,
and
if
she
be
perfectly
confident
of
her
own
woman
's
integrity
:
upon
which
Mademoiselle
,
with
many
encomium
on
the
fidelity
and
attachment
of
Teresa
,
recount
the
adventure
of
the
chambermaid
,
who
immediately
undergo
a
strict
enquiry
,
and
be
even
commit
to
prison
,
on
the
strength
of
her
former
misdemeanour
.
 
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
's
mate
insist
upon
undergo
the
same
tryal
with
the
rest
of
the
domestick
,
and
as
usual
comprehend
Fathom
in
her
insinuation
;
while
he
second
the
proposal
,
and
privately
counsel
the
old
lady
to
introduce
Teresa
to
the
magistrate
of
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
by
these
pre
-
concerted
recrimination
,
they
escape
all
suspicion
of
collusion
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
fruitless
inquiry
,
the
prisoner
be
discharge
from
her
confinement
,
and
turn
out
of
the
service
of
the
count
,
in
whose
private
opinion
the
character
of
no
person
suffer
so
much
,
as
that
of
his
own
son
,
whom
he
suspect
of
have
embezzle
the
jewel
,
for
the
use
of
a
certain
inamorata
,
who
,
at
that
time
,
be
say
to
have
captivate
his
affection
.
    
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
feel
,
upon
this
occasion
,
all
that
internal
anguish
which
a
man
of
honour
may
be
suppose
to
suffer
,
on
account
of
a
son
's
degeneracy
;
and
without
divulge
his
sentiment
,
or
even
hint
his
suspicion
to
the
youth
himself
,
determine
to
detach
him
at
once
from
such
dangerous
connexion
,
by
send
him
forthwith
to
Vienna
,
on
pretence
of
finish
his
exercise
at
the
academy
,
and
usher
him
into
acquaintance
with
the
great
world
.
    
<EOS>
though
he
would
not
be
think
by
the
young
gentleman
himself
,
to
harbour
the
least
doubt
of
his
moral
,
he
do
not
scruple
to
unbosom
himself
on
that
subject
to
Ferdinand
,
whose
sagacity
and
virtue
he
hold
in
great
veneration
.
 
<EOS>
this
indulgent
patron
express
himself
in
the
most
pathetic
term
,
on
the
untoward
disposition
of
his
son
;
he
tell
Fathom
that
he
should
accompany
Renaldo
(
that
be
the
youth
's
name
)
not
only
as
a
companion
,
but
a
preceptor
and
pattern
;
conjure
him
to
assist
his
tutor
in
superintend
his
conduct
,
and
to
reinforce
the
governor
's
precept
,
by
his
own
example
;
to
inculcate
upon
him
,
the
most
delicate
punctilio
's
of
honour
,
and
decoy
him
into
extravagance
,
rather
than
leave
the
least
illiberal
sentiment
in
his
heart
.
    
<EOS>
Our
crafty
adventurer
,
with
demonstration
of
the
utmost
sensibility
,
acknowledge
the
great
goodness
of
the
count
in
repose
such
confidence
in
his
integrity
;
which
,
as
he
observe
,
none
but
the
bad
of
villain
could
abuse
;
and
fervently
wish
that
he
may
no
longer
exist
,
than
he
should
continue
to
remember
and
resent
the
obligation
he
owe
to
his
kind
benefactor
.
 
<EOS>
while
preparation
be
make
for
their
departure
,
our
hero
hold
a
council
with
his
associate
,
whom
he
enrich
with
many
sage
instruction
touch
her
future
operation
;
he
at
the
same
time
disburthene
her
of
all
or
the
great
part
of
the
spoil
she
have
win
,
and
after
have
receive
diver
mark
of
bounty
from
the
count
and
his
lady
,
together
with
a
purse
from
his
young
mistress
,
he
set
out
for
Vienna
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
his
age
,
with
Renaldo
and
his
governor
,
who
be
provide
with
letter
of
recommendation
to
some
of
the
count
's
friend
belong
to
the
imperial
court
.
    
<EOS>
such
a
favourable
introduction
could
not
fail
of
be
advantageous
to
a
youth
of
Ferdinand
's
specious
accomplishment
:
for
he
be
consider
as
the
young
count
's
companion
,
admit
into
his
party
,
and
include
in
all
the
entertainment
to
which
Renaldo
be
invite
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
distinguish
himself
by
his
activity
and
address
,
in
the
course
of
those
exercise
that
be
teach
at
the
academy
of
which
he
be
pupil
;
his
manner
be
so
engaging
as
to
attract
the
acquaintance
of
his
fellow
student
,
and
his
conversation
be
sprightly
and
inoffensive
,
grow
into
very
great
request
;
in
a
word
,
he
and
the
young
count
form
a
remarkable
contrast
,
which
,
in
the
eye
of
the
world
,
redound
to
his
advantage
.
    
<EOS>
They
be
certainly
,
in
all
respect
,
the
reverse
of
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
Renaldo
,
under
a
total
defect
of
exterior
cultivation
,
possess
a
most
excellent
understanding
,
with
every
virtue
that
dignify
the
human
heart
;
while
the
other
,
beneath
a
most
agreeable
outside
,
with
an
inaptitude
and
aversion
to
letter
,
conceal
an
amazing
fund
of
villainy
and
ingratitude
.
 
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
his
observation
have
be
confine
to
a
narrow
sphere
,
and
his
reflexion
,
though
surprizingly
just
and
acute
,
have
not
attain
to
that
maturity
,
which
age
and
experience
give
:
<EOS>
but
now
,
his
perception
begin
to
be
more
distinct
,
and
extend
to
a
thousand
object
which
have
never
before
come
under
his
cognizance
.
    
<EOS>
He
have
formerly
imagine
,
but
be
now
fully
persuade
,
that
the
son
of
man
prey
upon
one
another
,
and
such
be
the
end
and
condition
of
their
being
.
    
<EOS>
among
the
principal
figure
of
life
,
he
observe
few
or
no
character
that
do
not
bear
a
strong
analogy
to
the
savage
tyrant
of
the
wood
.
 
<EOS>
one
resemble
a
tyger
in
fury
and
rapaciousness
;
a
second
prowled
about
like
an
hungry
wolf
,
seek
whom
he
may
devour
;
a
third
act
the
part
of
a
jackall
,
in
beat
the
bush
for
game
to
his
voracious
employer
;
and
a
fourth
imitate
the
wily
fox
,
in
practise
a
thousand
crafty
ambuscade
for
the
destruction
of
the
ignorant
and
unwary
.
 
<EOS>
this
last
be
the
department
of
life
for
which
he
find
himself
best
qualify
by
nature
and
inclination
,
and
he
accordingly
resolve
that
his
talent
should
not
rust
in
his
possession
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
already
pretty
well
versed
in
all
the
science
of
play
;
but
he
have
every
day
occasion
to
see
these
art
carry
to
such
a
surprising
pitch
of
finesse
and
dexterity
,
as
discourage
him
from
build
his
scheme
on
that
foundation
.
    
<EOS>
He
therefore
determine
to
fascinate
the
judgment
,
rather
than
the
eye
of
his
fellow
-
creature
,
by
a
continual
exercise
of
that
gift
of
deceiving
,
with
which
he
know
himself
endue
to
an
unrivalled
degree
;
and
to
acquire
unbounded
influence
with
those
who
may
be
subservient
to
his
interest
,
by
an
assiduous
application
to
their
prevail
passion
.
 
<EOS>
not
that
play
be
altogether
leave
out
in
the
projection
of
his
oeconomy
;
though
he
engage
himself
very
little
in
the
executive
part
of
gaming
:
    
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
long
in
Vienna
,
when
he
enter
into
league
with
a
genius
of
that
kind
,
whom
he
distinguish
among
the
pupil
of
the
academy
,
and
who
indeed
have
take
up
his
habitation
in
that
place
,
with
a
view
to
pillage
the
provincial
on
their
first
arrival
in
town
,
before
they
could
be
arm
with
proper
circumspection
to
preserve
their
money
,
or
have
time
to
dispose
of
it
in
any
other
shape
.
    
<EOS>
similar
character
naturally
attract
each
other
,
and
people
of
our
hero
's
principle
be
,
of
all
other
,
the
most
apt
to
distinguish
their
own
likeness
<EOS>
wheresoever
it
occur
;
because
they
always
keep
the
faculty
of
discerning
in
full
exertion
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
consequence
of
this
mutual
alertness
,
that
Ferdinand
and
the
stranger
,
who
be
a
native
of
Tyrol
,
perceive
themselves
reflect
in
the
disposition
of
each
other
,
and
immediately
enter
into
an
offensive
and
defensive
alliance
:
our
adventurer
undertaking
for
the
article
of
intelligence
,
countenance
and
counsel
;
and
his
associate
charge
himself
with
the
risque
of
execution
.
     
<EOS>
Fathom
make
various
effort
in
the
world
of
gallantry
.
   
<EOS>
thus
connect
they
begin
to
hunt
in
couple
;
and
Fathom
,
in
order
to
profit
by
the
alliance
,
with
a
good
grace
,
contrive
a
small
scheme
that
succeed
to
his
wish
.
 
<EOS>
Renaldo
be
one
night
intoxicate
in
the
course
of
a
merry
-
making
with
his
fellow
pupil
,
from
which
Fathom
have
purposely
absent
himself
,
be
by
the
Tyroleze
so
artfully
provoke
to
play
,
that
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
,
but
engage
at
pass
-
dice
with
that
fall
adversary
,
who
,
in
less
than
an
hour
,
strip
him
of
a
pretty
round
sum
.
    
<EOS>
Next
day
,
when
the
young
gentleman
recover
the
use
of
his
reflexion
,
he
be
sensibly
chagrin'd
<EOS>
at
the
folly
and
precipitation
of
his
own
conduct
,
an
account
of
which
he
communicate
in
confidence
to
our
hero
,
with
demonstration
of
infinite
shame
and
concern
.
    
<EOS>
Ferdinand
have
moralize
upon
the
subject
with
great
sagacity
,
and
sharply
inveigh
against
the
Tyroleze
,
for
the
unfair
advantage
he
have
take
,
retire
to
his
closet
and
write
the
follow
billet
,
which
be
immediately
send

"
the
obligation
I
owe

the
attachment
I
feel

not
suffer
me
to
be

you

insist
upon

booty

you
so
unjustly
get
;

morrow

you
have

upon
the
friend
of
Ferdinand
de
Fathom
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
gamester
no
sooner
receive
this
intimation
,
than
accord
to
the
plan
which
have
be
preconcerte
betwixt
the
author
and
him
,
he
go
to
the
apartment
of
Renaldo
,
and
present
the
sum
of
money
which
he
have
defraud
him
of
the
preceede
night
,
tell
him
with
a
stern
countenance
,
that
though
it
be
a
just
acquisition
,
he
scorn
to
avail
himself
of
his
good
fortune
against
any
person
who
entertain
the
small
doubt
of
his
honour
.
    
<EOS>
the
young
count
,
surprize
at
this
address
,
reject
his
offer
with
disdain
,
and
desire
to
know
the
meaning
of
such
an
unexpected
declaration
.
 
<EOS>
upon
which
,
the
other
produce
Ferdinand
's
billet
,
and
threatne
,
in
very
high
term
,
to
meet
the
stripling
accord
to
his
invitation
,
and
chastise
him
severely
for
his
presumption
.
 
<EOS>
the
consequence
of
this
explanation
be
obvious
.
 
<EOS>
Renaldo
,
impute
the
officiousness
of
Fathom
to
the
zeal
of
his
friendship
,
interpose
in
the
quarrel
,
which
be
amicably
compromised
,
not
a
little
to
the
honour
of
our
adventurer
,
who
thus
obtain
an
opportunity
of
display
his
courage
and
integrity
,
without
the
least
hazard
to
his
person
;
while
at
the
same
time
,
his
confederate
recommend
himself
to
the
esteem
of
the
young
count
,
by
his
spirited
behaviour
on
this
occasion
;
so
that
Renaldo
be
less
shy
of
his
company
for
the
future
,
the
Tyroleze
have
the
fairer
opportunity
to
prosecute
his
design
upon
the
young
gentleman
's
purse
.
    
<EOS>
It
would
be
almost
superfluous
to
say
that
these
be
not
neglect
.
 
<EOS>
the
son
of
count
Melvile
be
not
deficient
in
point
of
penetration
:
but
,
his
whole
study
be
,
at
that
time
,
engross
by
the
care
of
his
education
;
and
he
have
sometimes
recourse
to
play
,
as
to
an
amusement
by
which
he
seek
to
unbend
the
severity
of
his
attention
:
no
wonder
then
,
that
he
fall
a
prey
to
an
artful
gamester
,
who
have
be
regularly
train
to
the
profession
,
and
make
it
the
sole
study
of
his
life
;
especially
as
the
Hungarian
be
remarkable
for
a
warmth
of
temper
,
which
a
knight
of
the
post
always
know
how
to
manage
for
his
own
advantage
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
these
operation
,
Fathom
be
a
very
useful
correspondent
:
he
instruct
the
Tyroleze
in
the
peculiarity
of
Renaldo
's
disposition
,
and
make
him
acquaint
with
the
preper
season
for
profit
by
his
dexterity
.
 
<EOS>
Ferdinand
,
for
example
,
who
by
the
authority
derive
to
him
from
the
injunction
of
the
old
count
,
sometimes
take
upon
himself
the
office
of
an
adviser
,
cunningly
choose
to
counsel
the
son
,
at
those
conjuncture
,
when
he
know
him
least
able
to
bear
such
expostulation
.
 
<EOS>
Advice
,
improperly
administre
,
generally
act
in
diametrical
opposition
to
the
purpose
for
which
it
be
suppose
to
be
give
:
at
least
this
be
the
case
with
the
young
gentleman
,
who
,
inflame
by
the
reproof
of
such
a
tutor
,
use
to
obey
the
dictate
of
his
resentment
,
in
an
immediate
repetition
of
that
conduct
which
our
adventurer
have
take
the
liberty
to
disapprove
;
and
the
gamester
be
always
at
hand
,
to
minister
unto
his
indignation
.
 
<EOS>
by
these
mean
he
be
disencumber
of
diver
considerable
remittance
,
with
which
his
father
chearfully
supply
him
,
on
the
supposition
that
they
be
spend
with
taste
and
liberality
,
under
the
direction
of
our
adventurer
.
    
<EOS>
but
Ferdinand
's
view
be
not
confine
to
the
narrow
field
of
this
alliance
:
he
attempt
diver
enterprize
in
the
world
of
gallantry
,
conscious
of
his
own
personal
qualification
,
and
never
doubt
that
he
could
insinuate
himself
into
the
good
grace
of
some
married
lady
about
court
,
or
lie
an
opulent
dowager
under
contribution
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
meet
with
an
obstacle
in
his
endeavour
of
this
kind
,
which
all
his
art
be
unable
to
surmount
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
no
other
than
the
obscurity
of
his
birth
,
and
the
want
of
a
title
,
without
which
no
person
in
that
country
lay
claim
to
the
privilege
of
a
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
have
he
foresee
this
inconvenience
,
he
may
have
make
shift
to
obviate
the
consequence
,
by
obtain
permission
to
appear
in
the
character
of
the
count
's
kinsman
:
tho
'
,
in
all
probability
,
such
an
expedient
would
not
have
be
extremely
agreeable
to
the
old
gentleman
,
who
be
very
tenacious
of
the
honour
of
his
family
:
nevertheless
,
his
generosity
may
have
be
prevail
upon
,
to
indulge
Fathom
with
such
a
pretext
,
in
consideration
of
the
youth
's
suppose
attachment
,
and
the
obligation
for
which
he
deem
himself
indebted
to
his
deceased
mother
.
    
<EOS>
true
it
be
,
Ferdinand
,
upon
his
first
arrival
at
Vienna
,
have
be
admit
into
fashionable
company
,
on
the
footing
of
Renaldo
's
companion
,
because
no
body
suspect
the
defect
of
his
pedigree
;
and
even
after
a
report
have
be
circulate
to
the
prejudice
of
his
extraction
,
by
the
industry
of
a
lacquey
who
attend
the
young
count
,
there
be
not
want
many
young
people
of
distinction
,
who
still
favour
him
with
their
countenance
and
correspondence
:
but
he
be
no
longer
invite
to
private
family
,
in
which
only
he
could
expect
to
profit
by
his
address
among
the
lady
,
and
have
the
mortification
of
find
himself
frequently
except
from
party
which
be
expressly
calculate
for
the
entertainment
of
the
young
count
.
    
<EOS>
Luckily
,
his
spirit
be
so
pliant
as
to
sustain
these
slight
,
without
be
much
dejected
:
instead
of
repine
at
the
loss
of
that
respect
which
have
be
pay
to
him
at
first
,
he
endeavour
with
all
his
might
,
to
preserve
the
little
that
still
remain
,
and
resolve
to
translate
into
an
humbler
sphere
,
that
gallantry
which
he
have
no
long
opportunity
of
display
in
the
world
of
rank
and
fashion
.
     
<EOS>
He
effect
a
lodgment
in
the
house
of
a
rich
Jeweller
.
   
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
determination
,
he
to
the
uttermost
exert
his
good
humour
among
the
few
friend
of
consequence
his
fortune
have
leave
,
and
even
carry
his
complaisance
so
far
,
as
to
become
the
humble
servant
of
their
pleasure
;
while
he
attempt
to
extend
his
acquaintance
in
an
inferior
path
of
life
,
where
he
think
his
talent
would
shine
more
conspicuous
than
at
the
assembly
of
the
great
,
and
conduce
more
effectually
to
the
interest
of
all
his
design
.
 
<EOS>
nor
do
he
find
himself
disappointed
in
that
expectation
,
sanguine
as
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
find
mean
to
be
introduce
to
the
house
of
a
wealthy
bourgeois
,
where
every
individual
be
charm
with
his
easy
air
and
extraordinary
qualification
.
 
<EOS>
He
accommodate
himself
surprisingly
to
the
humour
of
the
whole
family
;
smoake
tobacco
,
swallow
wine
,
and
discourse
of
stone
with
the
husband
,
who
be
a
rich
jeweller
;
sacrifice
himself
to
the
pride
and
loquacity
of
the
wife
,
and
play
upon
the
violen
,
and
sing
alternately
,
for
the
amusement
of
his
only
daughter
,
a
buxom
lass
,
nearly
of
his
own
age
,
the
fruit
of
a
former
marriage
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
before
Ferdinand
have
reason
to
congratulate
himself
on
the
footing
he
have
gain
in
this
society
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
expect
to
find
,
and
in
a
little
time
actually
discover
that
mutual
jealousy
and
rancour
,
which
almost
always
subsist
between
a
daughter
and
her
step
-
dame
,
inflame
with
all
the
virulence
of
female
emulation
;
for
the
disparity
in
their
age
,
serve
only
to
render
them
the
more
inveterate
rival
in
the
desire
of
captivate
the
other
sex
.
 
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
have
deliberate
upon
the
mean
of
convert
this
animosity
to
his
own
advantage
,
see
no
method
for
this
purpose
so
feasible
,
as
that
of
make
his
approach
to
the
heart
of
both
,
by
ministre
to
each
in
private
,
food
for
their
reciprocal
envy
and
malevolence
:
because
he
well
know
that
no
road
lie
so
direct
and
open
to
a
woman
's
heart
,
as
that
of
gratify
her
passion
of
vanity
and
resentment
.
    
<EOS>
when
he
have
an
opportunity
of
be
particular
with
the
mother
,
he
express
his
concern
for
have
unwittingly
incur
the
displeasure
of
Mademoiselle
,
which
,
he
observe
,
be
obvious
in
every
circumstance
of
her
behaviour
towards
him
;
protest
he
be
utterly
innocent
of
all
intention
of
offend
her
;
and
that
he
could
not
account
for
his
disgrace
,
any
other
way
,
than
by
suppose
she
take
umbrage
at
the
direction
of
his
chief
regard
towards
her
mother
-
in
-
law
,
which
,
he
own
,
be
altogether
involuntary
,
be
wholly
influence
by
that
lady
's
superior
charm
and
politeness
.
    
<EOS>
such
a
declaration
be
perfectly
well
calculate
for
the
meridian
of
a
dame
like
her
,
who
with
all
the
intoxication
of
unenlightened
pride
,
and
an
increase
appetite
for
pleasure
,
have
begin
to
find
herself
neglect
,
and
even
to
believe
that
her
attraction
be
actually
in
the
wane
.
 
<EOS>
She
very
graciously
console
our
gallant
for
the
mishap
of
which
he
complain
;
represent
Wilhelmina
(
that
be
the
daughter
's
name
)
as
a
pert
,
illiterate
,
envious
baggage
,
of
whose
disgust
he
ought
to
make
no
consideration
;
then
she
recount
many
instance
of
her
own
generosity
to
that
young
lady
,
with
the
return
of
malice
and
ingratitude
she
have
make
;
and
lastly
,
enumerate
all
the
imperfection
of
her
person
,
education
,
and
behaviour
;
that
he
may
see
with
what
justice
the
gypsy
pretend
to
vye
with
those
who
have
be
distinguish
by
the
approbation
,
and
even
gallantry
of
the
good
people
in
Vienna
.
    
<EOS>
have
thus
establish
himself
her
confident
and
gossip
,
he
know
his
next
step
of
promotion
would
necessarily
be
to
the
degree
of
her
lover
;
and
in
that
belief
,
resolve
to
play
the
same
game
with
Mademoiselle
.
 
<EOS>
Wilhelmina
,
whose
complexion
be
very
much
a
-
kin
to
that
of
her
step
-
mother
:
indeed
they
resemble
each
other
too
much
to
live
upon
any
term
of
friendship
or
even
decorum
.
 
<EOS>
Fathom
,
in
order
to
enjoy
a
private
conversation
with
the
young
lady
,
never
fail
to
repeat
his
visit
every
afternoon
,
 
'
till
at
length
he
have
the
pleasure
of
find
her
disengage
,
the
jeweller
being
occupy
among
his
workman
,
and
his
wife
go
to
assist
at
a
lying
-
in
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
and
the
daughter
have
already
exchange
their
vow
,
by
the
expressive
language
of
the
eye
;
he
have
even
declare
himself
in
some
tender
ejaculation
which
have
be
softly
whisper
in
her
ear
,
when
he
could
snatch
an
opportunity
of
vent
them
,
unperceived
;
<EOS>
nay
,
he
have
upon
diver
occasion
,
gently
squeeze
her
fair
hand
,
on
pretence
of
tune
her
harpsichord
,
and
be
favour
with
return
of
the
same
cordial
pressure
:
<EOS>
so
that
instead
of
accost
her
with
the
fearful
hesitation
and
reserve
of
a
timid
swain
,
he
tell
her
,
after
the
exercise
of
the
doux
-
yeux
,
that
he
be
come
to
confer
with
her
upon
a
subject
that
nearly
concern
her
peace
;
and
ask
if
she
have
not
observe
of
late
,
an
evident
abatement
of
friendship
in
her
mother
's
behaviour
to
him
,
whom
she
have
formerly
treat
with
such
mark
of
favour
and
respect
.
 
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
would
not
pay
so
ill
a
compliment
,
to
her
own
discernment
as
to
say
she
have
not
perceive
the
alteration
,
which
,
on
the
contrary
,
she
own
be
extremely
palpable
;
nor
be
it
difficult
to
divine
the
cause
of
such
estranged
look
.
 
<EOS>
this
remark
be
accompany
with
an
irresistible
glance
,
she
smile
inchante
,
the
colour
deepen
on
her
cheek
,
her
breast
begin
to
heave
,
and
her
whole
frame
undergo
a
most
agreeable
confusion
.
    
<EOS>
Ferdinand
be
not
a
man
to
let
such
a
favourable
conjuncture
pass
unregarde
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
charming
Wilhelmina
!
<EOS>
exclaim
the
politician
in
an
affected
rapture
,
the
cause
be
as
conspicuous
as
your
attraction
.
    
<EOS>
She
hath
,
in
spite
of
all
my
circumspection
,
perceive
that
passion
which
it
be
not
in
my
power
to
conceal
,
and
in
consequence
of
which
,
I
now
declare
myself
your
devoted
adorer
;
or
,
conscious
of
your
superior
excellence
,
her
jealousy
hath
take
the
alarm
,
and
though
sting
with
conjecture
only
,
repine
at
the
triumph
of
your
perfection
.
 
<EOS>
how
far
this
spirit
of
malignity
may
be
inflame
to
my
prejudice
,
I
know
not
:
perhaps
as
this
be
the
first
,
it
may
be
also
the
last
opportunity
<EOS>
,
I
shall
have
of
avow
the
dear
sentiment
of
my
heart
,
to
the
fair
object
that
inspire
them
;
in
a
word
,
I
may
be
for
ever
exclude
from
your
presence
.
 
<EOS>
excuse
me
then
,
divine
creature
!
<EOS>
from
the
practice
of
those
unnecessary
form
,
which
I
should
take
pride
in
observe
,
be
I
indulge
with
the
ordinary
privilege
of
an
honourable
lover
;
and
once
for
all
,
accept
the
homage
of
an
heart
overflow
with
love
and
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
adorable
Wilhelmina
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
dazzle
with
your
supernatural
beauty
;
your
other
accomplishment
strike
me
with
wonder
and
awe
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
enchant
by
the
grace
of
your
deportment
,
ravish
with
the
charm
of
your
conversation
;
and
there
be
a
certain
tenderness
of
benevolence
in
that
endearing
aspect
,
which
,
I
trust
,
will
not
fail
to
melt
with
sympathy
at
the
emotion
of
a
faithful
slave
like
me
.
"
    
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
throw
himself
upon
his
knee
,
and
seize
her
plump
hand
,
press
it
to
his
lip
with
all
the
violence
of
real
transport
.
    
<EOS>
the
nymph
,
whose
passion
nature
have
fill
to
the
brim
,
could
not
hear

Our

could
not

be
open

create
a
noise
that
would
confirm
the
suspicion

that
over

above
this
objection

he
would
,
in
sallye
from

door

run
the
risque

be
meet
by
her
father

who
in

probability
would
present
himself
before
it

in
order

hinder

escape

convey
him
softly

fervently
to

sundry
oblique
hint
against

that

viciously
incline
by
their

that
she
do
not
wonder
at
their
doubt
the
virtue

that

despise
the
insinuation

ought
to
be
more
circumspect
in
their

utter
these
flower
of

at

back

the
young

assume
an
ironical
air

admonish
her
father
to
search
every
corner

apartment

she
even
affect
to
assist
his
enquiry
;
with
her
own
hand
pull
out
a
parcel
of
small
drawer

in

trinket

desire
him
to
look
into
her
needle
case

thimble

and
see
his
examination
fruitless

earnestly
intreate
him
to
rummage
her
closet

say
with
a
sneer

that

the
dishonourer

place

<EOS>
the
manner
in
which
she
pretend
to
ridicule
his
apprehension

make
an
impression
upon
the
jeweler
,
who
be
very
well
disposed
to
retreat
into
his
own
nest
,
when
his
wife
,
with
a
certain
slyness
in
her
countenance
,
besought
him
to
comply
with
his
daughter
's
request
,
and
look
into
that
same
closet

by
which

Wilhelmina

obtain
a
complete
triumph

palsy

tremble
at
every
joint
,
the
sweat
trickle
down
his
forehead
,
his
tooth
begin
to
chatter
,
his
hair
to
stand
on
end
,
and
he
,
in
his
heart
,
bitterly
curse
the
daughter
's
petulance
,
the
mother
's
malice
,
together
with
his
own
precipitation
,
by
which
he
be
involve
in
an
adventure
so
pregnant
with
danger
and
disgrace

<EOS>
indeed
,
the
reader
may
easily
conceive
his
disorder
,
when
he
hear
the
key
turning
in
the
lock
,
and
the
german
swearing
that
he
would
make
him
food
for
the
beast
of
the
field
,
and
the
fowl
of
the
air

<EOS>
Fathom
have
come
unprepared
with
weapon
of
defence
,
be
naturally
an
oeconomist
of
his
person
,
and
see
himself
on
the
brink
of
forfeit
not
only
the
promised
harvest
of
his
double
intrigue
,
but
also
the
reputation
of
a
man
of
honour
,
upon
which
all
his
future
hope
depend
:
his
agony
be
therefore
unspeakable

when

door
fly
open

and
it
be
not

after
a
considerable
pause
of
recollection
,
that
he
perceive
the
candle
extinguish
by
the
motion
of

from
the
German

sudden
irruption

<EOS>
this
accident
,
which
disconcert
him
so
much
as
to
put
a
full
stop

very
favourable
to

who
summon
all
his
presence

creep
up
into
the
chimney
,
while
the
jeweller
stand
at
the
door
,
wait
for
his
wife
's
return
with
another
light
;
so
that
when
the
closet
be
examine
,
there
be
nothing
find
to
justify
the
report
which
the
step
-
mother
have
make
;
and
the
father
,
after
have
make
a
slight
apology
to
Wilhelmina
for
his
intrusion
,
retire
with
his
yoke
-
fellow
into
their
own
chamber

who
little
think
that
her
Papa

have
take
her

overwhelmed
with
confusion
and
dismay
,
when
she
see
him
enter
the
closet
,
and
have
her
lover
be
discover
,
would
in
all
probability
have
be
the
loud
in
his
reproach
,
and
perhaps
have
accuse
him
of
an
intention
to
rob
the
house
:
<EOS>
but
she
be
altogether
astonished
when
she
find
he
have
make
shift
to
elude
the
inquiry
of
her
parent
,
because
she
could
not
conceive
the
possibility
of
his
escaping
by
the
window
,
which
be
in
the
third
story
,
at
a
prodigious
distance
from
the
ground
;
and
how
he
could
conceal
himself
in
the
apartment
,
be
a
mystery
which

could
by
no

unfold

before

she
light
her
lamp

on
pretence

dark

after
the
perturbation
of

she
have
undergo

and
her
room
be
no
sooner
evacuate

such
troublesome
visitant

than
she
secure
the
door

go
in
quest
of
her
lover

accordingly
,
every
corner
of
the
closet
undergo
a
new
search
,
and
she
call
upon
his
name
with
a
soft
voice
,
which
she
think
no
other
person
would
overhear
:
<EOS>
but
Ferdinand
do
not
think
proper
to
gratify
her
impatience
,
because
he
could
not
judge
of
the
predicament
in
which
he
stand
by
the
evidence
of
all
his
sense
,
and
would
not
relinquish
his
post

until
he
should
be
better
certify
that
the
coast
be
clear

<EOS>
mean
<EOS>
while

his
Dulcinea

inquiry

there

something
preternatural
in
the
circumstance
of
his

so
unaccountably

begin
to
cross
herself
with
great
devotion

She
return
to
her
chamber
,
fix
the
lamp
in
the
fire

place

and
throw
herself
upon
the
bed
,
give
way
to
the
suggestion
of
her
superstition
,
which
be
reinforce
by
the
silence
that
prevail
,
and
the
gloomy
glimmering
of
the
light
.
 
<EOS>
She
reflect
upon
the
trespass
she
have
already
commit
in
her
heart
,
and
in
the
conjecture
of
her
fear
,
believe
that
her

the
devil

that
the

happily
asleep

venture
to
come
forth

instantly
scream
,
and
begin
to
repeat
her
Pater
-
noster
with
an
audible
voice
:
upon
which
Ferdinand
;
foresee
that
her
parent
would
be
again
alarm
,
would
not
stay
to
undeceive
her
,
and
explain
himself
;
but
unlock
the
door
with
great
expedition
,
run
down
stair
,
and
luckily
accomplish
his
escape
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
undoubtedly
the
wise
measure
he
could
have
take
:
for
he
have
not
perform
one
half
of
his
descent
toward
the
street
,
when
the
German
be
at
his
daughter
's
bed
-
side
,
demand
to
know
the
cause
of
her
exclamation
:
she
then
give
him
an
account
of
what
she
have
see
,
with
all
the
exaggeration
of
her
own
fancy
,
and
after
have
weigh
the
circumstance
of
her
story
,
he
interpret
the
apparition
into
a
thief
,
who
have
find
mean
to
open
the
door
that
communicate
with
the
stair
,
but
have
be
scare
by
Wilhelmina
's
shriek
,
have
be
oblige
to
retreat
before
he
could
execute
his
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
's
spirit
be
so
woefully
disturb
by
this
adventure
,
that
for
a
whole
week
he
feel
no
inclination
to
visit
his
inamorata
,
and
be
not
without
apprehension
that
the
affair
have
terminate
in
an
explanation
very
little
to
his
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
,
however
,
deliver
from
this
disagreeable
suspence
,
by
an
accidental
meeting
with
the
jeweller
himself
,
who
kindly
chide
him
for
his
long
absence
,
and
entertain
him
in
the
street
,
with
an
account
of
the
alarm
which
his
family
have
sustain
,
by
a
thief
who
break
into
Wilhelmina
's
apartment
.
    
<EOS>
Glad
to
find
his
apprehension
mistaken
,
he
renew
his
correspondence
with
the
family
,
and
in
a
little
time
,
find
reason
to
console
himself
for
the
jeopardy
and
panic
he
have
undergo
.
     
<EOS>
He
be
reduce
to
a
dreadful
dilemma
,
in
consequence
of
an
assignation
with
the
wife
.
   
<EOS>
nor
be
his
whole
care
and
attention
engross
by
the
execution
of
this
scheme
upon
the
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
while
he
manage
his
concern
in
that
quarter
,
with
incredible
ardour
and
application
,
he
be
not
the
less
indefatigable
in
the
prosecution
of
his
design
upon
the
mother
-
in
-
law
,
which
he
forewarde
with
all
his
art
,
during
those
opportunity
he
enjoy
in
the
absence
of
Wilhelmina
,
who
be
frequently
call
away
by
the
domestic
duty
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
the
passion
of
the
jeweller
's
wife
be
in
such
a
state
of
exaltation
,
as
exempt
our
hero
from
the
repulse
and
fatigue
attend
a
long
siege
.
    
<EOS>
We
have
already
observe
how
cunningly
he
cattere
for
the
gratification
of
her
ruling
appetite
,
and
have
exhibit
pregnant
proof
of
his
ability
in
gain
upon
the
human
heart
;
the
reader
will
not
therefore
be
surprize
at
the
rapidity
of
his
conquest
over
the
affection
of
a
lady
whose
complexion
be
perfectly
amorous
,
and
whose
vanity
lay
her
open
to
all
the
attempt
of
adulation
.
    
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
matter
be
quickly
bring
to
such
a
mutual
understanding
,
that
one
evening
,
while
they
amuse
themselves
at
lansquenet
,
Fathom
conjure
her
to
give
him
the
rendezvous
next
day
,
at
the
house
of
any
third
person
of
her
own
sex
,
in
whose
discretion
she
could
confide
;
and
after
a
few
affected
scruple
on
her
side
,
which
he
well
know
how
to
surmount
,
she
comply
with
his
request
,
and
the
circumstance
of
the
appointment
be
settle
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
after
this
treaty
,
their
satisfaction
rise
to
such
a
warmth
,
and
the
conversation
become
so
reciprocally
endearing
,
that
our
gallant
express
his
impatience
of
wait
so
long
for
the
accomplishment
of
his
wish
;
and
with
the
most
eager
transport
,
beg
she
would
,
if
possible
,
curtail
the
term
of
his
expectation
,
that
his
brain
may
not
suffer
by
his
stand
so
many
tedious
hour
on
the
giddy
verge
of
rapture
.
    
<EOS>
the
dame
,
who
be
naturally
compassionate
,
sympathize
with
his
condition
,
and
unable
to
resist
his
pathetic
supplication
,
give
him
to
understand
that
his
desire
could
not
be
grant
,
without
subject
them
both
to
some
hazard
,
but
that
she
be
dispose
to
run
any
risque
in
behalf
of
his
happiness
and
peace
.
 
<EOS>
after
this
affectionate
preamble
,
she
tell
him
that
her
husband
be
then
engage
in
a
quarterly
meeting
of
the
jeweller
,
from
whence
he
never
fail
to
return
quite
overwhelmed
with
wine
,
tobacco
,
and
the
phlegm
of
his
own
constitution
;
so
that
he
would
fall
fast
asleep
as
soon
as
his
head
should
touch
the
pillow
;
and
she
be
at
liberty
to
entertain
the
lover
without
interruption
,
provide
he
could
find
mean
to
deceive
the
jealous
vigilance
of
Wilhelmina
,
and
conceal
himself
in
some
corner
of
the
house
,
unsuspected
and
unperceived
.
    
<EOS>
Our
lover
,
remember
his
adventure
with
the
daughter
,
would
have
willingly
dispense
with
this
expedient
,
and
begin
to
repent
of
the
eagerness
with
which
he
have
prefer
his
sollicitation
;
but
,
see
there
be
now
no
opportunity
of
retract
with
honour
,
he
affect
to
enter
heartily
into
the
conversation
,
and
after
much
canvass
,
it
be
determine
that
while
Wilhelmina
be
employ
in
the
kitchen
,
the
mother
should
conduct
our
adventurer
to
the
outward
door
,
where
he
should
pay
the
compliment
of
parting
,
so
as
to
be
overhear
by
the
young
lady
,
but
in
the
mean
time
,
glide
softly
into
the
jeweller
's
bed
-
chamber
,
which
be
a
place
they
imagine
least
liable
to
the
effect
of
a
daughter
's
pry
disposition
;
and
conceal
himself
in
a
large
press
or
wardrobe
,
that
stand
in
one
corner
of
the
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
the
scene
be
immediately
act
with
great
success
,
and
our
hero
coope
up
in
his
cage
,
where
he
wait
so
long
,
that
his
desire
begin
to
subside
,
and
his
imagination
to
aggravate
the
danger
of
his
situation
.
    
<EOS>
"
suppose
,
"
say
he
to
himself
,
"
this
brutal
German
,
instead
of
be
stupifie
with
wine
,
should
come
home
inflame
with
brandy
,
to
the
use
of
which
he
be
sometimes
addict
;
far
from
feel
any
inclination
to
sleep
,
he
will
labour
under
the
most
fretful
anxiety
of
watch
<EOS>
,
every
irascible
particle
in
his
disposition
will
be
exasperate
:
he
will
be
offend
with
every
object
that
may
present
itself
to
his
view
,
and
if
there
be
the
least
ingredient
of
jealousy
in
his
temper
,
it
will
manifest
itself
in
riot
and
rage
.
 
<EOS>
what
if
his
frenzy
should
prompt
him
to
search
his
wife
's
chamber
for
gallant
?
    
<EOS>
this
would
certainly
be
the
first
place
to
which
he
would
direct
his
inquiry
;
or
,
grant
this
supposition
chimerical
,
I
may
be
seize
with
an
irresistible
inclination
to
cough
,
before
he
be
oppress
with
sleep
:
he
may
be
wake
by
the
noise
I
shall
make
in
disengage
myself
from
this
embarrassed
situation
;
and
finally
,
I
may
find
it
impracticable
to
retire
unseen
or
unheard
,
after
every
thing
else
shall
have
succeed
to
my
wish

"
    
<EOS>
these
suggestion
do
not
at
all
contribute
to
the
quiet
of
our
adventurer
,
who
have
wait
three
whole
hour
in
the
most
uncomfortable
suspence
,
hear
the
jeweller
bring
into
the
room
in
that
very
condition
which
his
fear
have
prognosticate
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
<EOS>
,
it
seem
,
quarrel
over
his
cup
with
another
tradesman
,
and
receive
a
salutation
on
the
forehead
with
a
candlestick
,
which
,
not
only
leave
an
ignominious
and
painful
mark
upon
his
countenance
,
but
even
disorder
his
brain
to
a
very
dangerous
degree
of
delirium
:
so
that
,
instead
of
allow
himself
quietly
to
be
undress
and
put
to
bed
by
his
wife
,
he
answer
all
her
gentle
admonition
and
caress
,
with
the
most
opprobrious
invective
and
obstreperous
behaviour
;
and
though
he
do
not
tax
her
with
infidelity
to
his
bed
,
he
virulently
accuse
her
of
extravagance
and
want
of
oeconomy
,
observe
her
expensive
way
of
living
would
bring
him
to
a
morsal
of
bread
,
and
unfortunately
recollect
the
attempt
of
the
suppose
thief
,
start
up
from
his
chair
,
swear
by
God
's
mother
,
that
he
would
forthwith
arm
himself
with
a
brace
of
pistol
,
and
search
every
apartment
of
the
house
.
    
<EOS>
"
that
press
,
"
say
he
,
with
great
vociferation
,
"
may
,
for
aught
I
know
,
be
the
receptacle
of
some
ruffian
.
"
    
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
approach
the
ark
in
which
Fathom
be
embark
,
and
exclaim
"
come
forth
,
Satan
,
"
apply
his
foot
to
the
door
of
it
,
with
such
violence
as
throw
him
from
the
centre
of
gravity
,
and
lay
him
sprawl
on
his
back
.
 
<EOS>
this
address
make
such
an
impression
upon
our
adventurer
,
that
he
have
well
nigh
obey
the
summon
,
and
burst
from
his
concealment
,
in
a
desperate
effort
to
escape
,
without
be
recognize
by
the
intoxicate
German
:
and
indeed
have
the
application
be
repeat
,
he
in
all
likelihood
would
have
try
the
experiment
;
for
,
by
this
time
,
his
terror
have
wax
too
strong
to
be
much
longer
suppress
:
from
this
hazardous
enterprize
,
he
be
however
exempt
by
a
lucky
accident
that
happen
to
his
disturber
,
whose
head
chance
to
pitch
upon
the
corner
of
a
chair
,
in
his
fall
,
he
be
immediately
lull
into
a
trance
;
during
which
,
the
considerate
lady
guess
the
disorder
of
her
gallant
,
and
dread
further
interruption
,
very
prudently
release
him
from
his
confinement
,
after
she
have
put
out
the
light
,
and
in
the
dark
convey
him
to
the
door
,
where
he
be
comfort
with
the
promise
that
she
would
punctually
remember
the
rendezvous
of
next
day
.
    
<EOS>
She
then
invoke
the
assistance
of
the
servant
,
who
be
wake
for
the
purpose
,
lift
up
their
master
,
and
tumble
him
into
bed
,
while
Ferdinand
hie
him
home
in
an
universal
sweat
,
bless
himself
from
any
future
atchievement
of
that
sort
,
in
an
house
,
where
he
have
be
twice
in
such
imminent
danger
of
life
and
reputation
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
do
not
fail
to
honour
the
assignation
,
and
avail
himself
of
the
disposition
his
mistress
manifest
,
to
make
him
all
the
recompence
in
her
power
,
for
the
disappointment
and
chagrin
which
he
have
undergo
.
     
<EOS>
but
at
length
succeed
in
his
attempt
upon
both
.
   
<EOS>
have
thus
gain
a
complete
victory
over
the
affection
of
these
two
lady
,
he
begin
to
convert
his
good
fortune
to
the
purpose
of
that
principle
,
from
which
his
view
be
never
,
no
not
for
a
moment
,
detach
.
 
<EOS>
in
other
word
,
he
use
them
as
minister
and
purveyor
to
his
avarice
and
fraud
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
the
mother
in
law
,
she
be
of
herself
so
liberal
as
to
anticipate
the
wish
of
any
moderate
adventurer
,
and
present
with
sundry
valuable
jewel
,
as
memorial
of
her
esteem
;
nor
be
the
daughter
backward
in
such
expression
of
regard
;
she
already
consider
his
interest
as
her
own
,
and
take
frequent
opportunity
of
secreting
,
for
his
benefit
,
certain
stray
trinket
that
she
happen
to
pick
up
in
her
excursion
within
door
.
    
<EOS>
all
these
gratification
he
receive
with
demonstration
of
infinite
constraint
and
reluctance
,
and
in
the
midst
of
his
rapacious
extortion
,
act
so
cunningly
as
to
impose
himself
upon
both
,
for
a
miracle
of
disinterested
integrity
.
    
<EOS>
yet
not
content
with
what
he
thus
could
earn
,
and
despair
of
be
able
to
steer
the
bark
of
his
fortune
for
any
length
of
time
,
between
two
such
dangerous
quicksand
,
he
resolve
to
profit
by
the
occasion
while
it
last
,
and
strike
some
considerable
stroke
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
a
plan
be
form
in
consequence
of
this
determination
,
and
at
an
appointment
with
the
mother
,
in
the
house
of
their
female
friend
,
our
adventurer
appear
with
an
air
of
dejection
,
which
he
veil
with
a
thin
cover
of
force
pleasantry
,
that
his
mistress
may
suppose
he
endeavour
to
conceal
some
mortal
chagrin
that
prey
upon
his
heart
.
    
<EOS>
the
stratagem
succede
to
his
wish
:
she
observe
his
countenance
between
while
overcast
,
take
notice
of
the
involuntary
sigh
he
heave
;
and
with
the
most
tender
expression
of
sympathy
,
conjure
him
to
make
her
acquaint
with
the
cause
of
his
affliction
.
    
<EOS>
instead
of
gratify
her
request
immediately
,
he
evade
her
question
with
a
respectful
reserve
,
imply
,
that
his
love
would
not
suffer
him
to
make
her
a
partner
in
his
sorrow
;
and
this
delicacy
on
his
part
,
whet
her
impatience
and
concern
to
such
a
degree
,
that
rather
than
keep
her
in
such
an
agony
of
doubt
and
apprehension
<EOS>
,
he
be
prevail
upon
to
tell
her
,
that
he
have
be
the
preceede
night
engage
with
a
company
of
his
fellow
student
,
where
he
have
make
too
free
with
the
champaigne
,
so
that
his
caution
forsook
him
,
and
he
have
be
decoy
into
a
play
by
a
Tyroleze
gamester
,
who
strip
him
of
all
his
ready
money
,
and
obtain
from
him
,
an
obligation
for
two
hundred
florin
,
which
he
could
not
possibly
pay
,
without
have
recourse
to
his
relation
,
the
count
de
Melvile
,
who
would
have
just
cause
to
be
incense
at
his
extravagance
.
    
<EOS>
this
information
he
conclude
,
by
declare
,
that
,
cost
what
it
would
,
he
be
resolve
to
make
a
candid
confession
of
the
truth
,
and
throw
himself
entirely
upon
the
generosity
of
his
patron
,
who
could
inflict
no
other
punishment
than
that
of
discard
him
from
his
favour
and
protection
:
a
misfortune
,
which
,
how
grievous
soever
it
may
be
,
he
should
be
able
to
sustain
with
fortitude
,
<EOS>
could
he
fall
upon
some
method
of
satisfy
the
Tyrolese
,
who
be
very
importunate
and
savage
in
his
demand
.
 
<EOS>
His
kind
mistress
no
sooner
find
out
the
source
of
his
inquietude
,
than
she
promise
to
dry
it
up
,
assure
him
that
next
day
at
the
same
hour
,
she
would
enable
him
to
discharge
the
debt
;
so
that
he
may
set
his
heart
at
ease
,
and
recollect
that
gaiety
which
be
the
soul
of
her
enjoyment
.
    
<EOS>
He
express
the
utmost
astonishment
at
this
generous
proffer
,
which
,
however
,
he
decline
with
an
affected
earnestness
of
refusal
,
protest
that
he
should
be
extremely
mortify
,
if
he
think
she
look
upon
him
as
one
of
those
mercenary
gallant
,
who
could
make
such
a
sordid
use
of
a
lady
's
affection

"
cry
our
politician
in
a
pathetic
strain
,
"
<EOS>
whatever
happen
,
I
shall
never
part
with
that
internal
consolation
that
conscious
honour
never
fail
to
yield
in
the
deep
scene
of
solitary
distress
:
the
attachment
I
have
the
honour
to
profess
for
your
amiable
person
,
be
not
found
on
such
inglorious
motive
;
but
,
be
the
genuine
result
of
that
generous
passion
,
which
none
but
the
noble
-
minded
feel
,
and
the
only
circumstance
of
this
misfortune
,
that
I
dread
to
encounter
,
be
,
the
necessity
of
withdraw
myself
for
ever
,
from
the
presence
of
her
,
whose
genial
smile
could
animate
my
soul
against
all
the
persecution
of
adverse
fortune
.
"
    
<EOS>
this
declamation
,
accompany
with
a
profound
sigh
,
serve
only
to
inflame
her
desire
of
extricate
him
from
the
difficulty
in
which
he
be
involve
.
 
<EOS>
She
exhaust
all
her
eloquence
in
attempt
to
persuade
him
that
his
refusal
be
an
outrage
against
her
affection
:
he
pretend
to
refute
her
argument
,
and
remain
unshaken
by
all
the
power
of
her
sollicitation
;
until
she
have
recourse
to
the
most
passionate
remonstrance
of
love
,
and
fall
at
his
foot
in
the
posture
of
a
forlorn
shepherdess
.
 
<EOS>
what
he
refuse
to
her
reason
,
he
grant
to
her
tear
,
because
his
heart
be
melt
by
her
affliction
,
and
next
day
condescend
to
accept
of
her
money
,
out
of
pure
regard
to
her
happiness
and
peace
.
    
<EOS>
encourage
by
the
success
of
this
atchievement
,
he
resolve
to
practise
the
same
experiment
upon
Wilhelmina
,
in
hope
of
extract
an
equal
share
of
profit
from
her
simplicity
and
attachment
;
and
at
their
very
next
nocturnal
rendezvous
in
her
chamber
,
re
-
act
the
farce
already
rehearse
;
with
a
small
variation
,
which
he
think
necessary
to
stimulate
the
young
lady
in
his
behalf
.
    
<EOS>
He
rightly
conclude
,
that
she
be
by
no
means
mistress
of
such
a
considerable
sum
as
he
have
already
extort
from
her
mother
;
and
therefore
think
proper
to
represent
himself
in
the
most
urgent
predicament
,
that
her
apprehension
,
on
his
account
,
may
be
so
alarm
,
as
to
engage
her
in
some
enterprize
for
his
advantage
,
which
,
otherwise
,
she
would
never
have
dream
of
undertaking
.
 
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
after
have
describe
his
own
calamitous
situation
,
in
consequence
of
her
press
intreatie
,
which
he
affect
to
evade
,
he
give
her
to
understand
,
that
there
be
no
person
upon
earth
,
to
whom
he
would
have
recourse
in
this
emergency
;
for
which
reason
,
he
be
determined
to
rid
himself
of
all
his
care
at
once
,
upon
the
friendly
point
of
his
own
faithful
sword
.
    
<EOS>
such
a
dreadful
resolution
could
not
fail
to
operate
upon
the
tender
passion
of
his
Dulcinea
;
she
be
instantly
seize
with
an
agony
of
fear
and
distraction
:
her
grief
manifest
itself
in
a
flood
of
tear
,
while
she
hang
round
his
neck
,
conjure
him
,
in
the
most
melting
term
,
by
their
mutual
love
,
in
which
they
have
be
so
happy
,
to
lay
aside
that
fatal
determination
,
which
would
infallibly
involve
her
in
the
same
fate
;
for
she
take
Heaven
to
witness
,
that
she
would
not
one
moment
survive
the
knowledge
of
his
death
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
not
deficient
in
expression
of
reciprocal
regard
:
he
extoll
her
love
and
tenderness
with
a
most
extravagant
eulogium
;
and
seem
wrung
with
mortal
anguish
at
the
prospect
of
part
for
ever
from
his
lovely
Wilhelmina
;
but
his
honour
be
a
stern
and
rigid
creditor
,
that
could
not
be
appease
,
except
with
his
blood
;
and
all
the
boon
she
could
obtain
,
by
dint
of
the
most
woeful
supplication
,
be
a
promise
to
defer
the
execution
of
his
baleful
purpose
,
for
the
space
of
four
and
twenty
hour
,
during
which
,
she
hope
,
Heaven
would
compassionate
her
suffering
,
and
inspire
her
with
some
contrivance
for
their
mutual
relief
.
 
<EOS>
thus
he
yield
to
her
fervent
request
,
rather
with
a
view
to
calm
the
present
transport
of
her
sorrow
,
than
with
any
expectation
of
see
himself
redeem
from
his
fate
,
by
her
interposition
;
such
at
least
be
his
profession
,
when
he
take
his
leave
,
assure
her
,
that
he
would
not
quit
his
being
,
before
he
should
have
devote
a
few
hour
to
another
interview
with
the
dear
object
of
his
love
.
    
<EOS>
have
thus
kindle
the
train
,
he
do
not
doubt
that
the
mine
of
his
craft
would
take
effect
,
and
repair
to
his
own
lodging
,
in
full
persuasion
of
see
his
aim
accomplish
,
before
the
time
fix
for
their
last
assignation
.
 
<EOS>
His
prognostic
be
next
morning
verefie
by
the
arrival
of
a
messenger
,
who
bring
to
him
a
small
parcel
,
to
which
be
cement
with
sealing
-
wax
,
the
follow
epistle
:
    
"
Jewel
of
my
soul
!
<EOS>
Scarce
have
you
,
last
night
,
quit
my
disconsolate
arm
,
when
I
happily
recollect
,
that
there
be
in
my
possession
,
a
gold
chain
,
of
value
more
than
sufficient
to
answer
the
exigence
of
your
present
occasion
:
 
<EOS>
It
be
pledge
to
my
grand
-
father
for
two
hundred
crown
,
by
a
Knight
of
Malta
,
who
soon
after
perish
in
a
sea
-
engagement
with
the
enemy
of
our
faith
;
so
that
it
become
the
property
of
our
house
,
and
be
bequeath
to
me
by
the
old
gentleman
,
as
a
memorial
of
his
particular
affection
.
    
<EOS>
upon
whom
can
I
more
properly
bestow
it
,
than
him
who
be
already
master
of
my
heart
!
<EOS>
receive
it
,
therefore
,
from
the
bearer
of
this
billet
,
and
convert
it
without
scruple
to
that
use
which
shall
be
most
conducive
to
your
ease
and
satisfaction
;
nor
seek
,
from
a
too
romantic
notion
of
honour
,
which
I
know
you
entertain
,
to
excuse
yourself
,
from
accept
this
testimony
of
my
affection
:
<EOS>
for
I
have
already
swear
before
an
image
of
our
blessed
lady
,
that
I
will
no
longer
own
you
as
the
sovereign
of
my
heart
,
nor
even
indulge
you
with
another
interview
,
if
you
reject
this
mark
of
tenderness
and
concern
,
from
your
ever
faithful
"
Wilhelmina
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
heart
of
our
adventurer
begin
to
bound
with
joy
,
when
he
survey
the
content
of
this
letter
;
and
his
eye
sparkle
with
transport
at
sight
of
the
chain
,
which
he
immediately
perceive
to
be
worth
twice
the
sum
she
have
mention
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
would
not
avail
himself
without
further
question
of
her
generosity
;
but
,
<EOS>
that
same
night
,
repair
to
her
apartment
at
the
usual
hour
of
meeting
,
he
prostrate
himself
before
her
,
and
counterfeit
extreme
agitation
of
spirit
,
beg
,
in
the
most
urgent
term
,
not
even
unaccompanied
with
tear
,
that
she
would
take
back
the
present
which
he
tender
for
her
acceptance
;
and
spare
him
the
most
insufferable
mortification
of
think
himself
expose
to
the
imputation
of
be
mercenary
in
his
love
.
    
<EOS>
such
,
he
say
,
be
the
delicacy
of
his
passion
,
that
he
could
not
possibly
exist
under
the
apprehension
of
incur
a
censure
so
unworthy
of
his
sentiment
;
and
he
would
a
thousand
time
,
sooner
undergo
the
persecution
of
his
rancorous
creditor
,
than
bear
the
thought
of
be
in
the
small
consideration
lessen
in
her
esteem
:
nay
,
so
far
do
he
carry
his
pretension
to
punctilio
,
as
to
protest
that
<EOS>
should
she
refuse
to
quiet
the
scruple
of
his
honour
,
on
this
score
,
her
unyielding
beneficence
would
serve
only
to
hasten
the
execution
of
his
determined
purpose
,
to
withdraw
himself
at
once
from
a
life
of
vanity
and
misfortune
.
    
<EOS>
the
more
pathetically
he
plead
for
her
compliance
,
the
more
strenuously
do
she
resist
his
remonstrance
.
 
<EOS>
She
advance
all
the
argument
her
reason
,
love
and
terror
could
suggest
,
remind
him
of
her
oath
,
from
which
,
he
could
not
suppose
she
would
recede
,
whatever
the
consequence
may
be
;
and
in
conclusion
,
vow
to
Heaven
,
with
great
solemnity
and
devotion
,
that
she
would
not
survive
the
news
of
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
thus
the
alternative
she
offer
,
be
either
to
retain
the
chain
and
be
happy
in
her
affection
,
or
forfeit
all
title
to
her
love
,
and
die
in
the
conviction
of
have
bring
his
innocent
mistress
to
an
untimely
grave
.
    
<EOS>
His
fortitude
be
not
proof
against
this
last
consideration
:
    
"
My
savage
honour
,
"
say
he
,
"
would
enable
me
to
endure
the
pang
of
eternal
separation
,
in
the
confidence
of
be
endow
with
the
power
of
end
these
torture
by
the
energy
of
my
own
hand
;
but
the
prospect
of
Wilhelmina
's
death
,
and
that
too
occasion
by
my
inflexibility
,
disarm
my
soul
of
all
her
resolution
,
swallow
up
the
dictate
of
my
jealous
pride
,
and
fill
my
bosom
with
such
a
gush
of
tenderness
and
sorrow
,
as
overwhelm
the
whole
oeconomy
of
my
purpose
!
 
<EOS>
yes
,
inchante
creature
!
 
<EOS>
I
sacrifice
my
glory
to
that
irresistible
reflection
:
and
rather
than
know
myself
the
cruel
instrument
of
rob
the
world
of
such
perfection
,
consent
to
retain
the
fatal
testimony
of
your
love
.
"
    
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
pocket
the
chain
,
with
an
air
of
ineffable
mortification
,
and
be
reward
for
his
compliance
with
the
most
endearing
caress
of
his
Dulcinea
,
who
,
amidst
the
tumult
of
his
joy
,
ejaculate
a
thousand
acknowledgment
to
Heaven
,
for
have
bless
her
with
the
affection
of
such
a
man
,
whose
honour
be
unrivalle
by
any
thing
but
his
love
.
     
<EOS>
His
success
beget
a
blind
security
,
by
which
he
be
once
again
well
nigh
entrap
in
his
Dulcinea
's
apartment
.
   
<EOS>
in
this
manner
do
the
crafty
Fathom
turn
to
account
those
ingratiate
qualification
he
inherit
from
nature
;
and
maintain
,
with
incredible
assiduity
and
circumspection
,
an
amorous
correspondence
with
two
domestic
rival
,
who
watch
the
conduct
of
each
other
,
with
the
most
indefatigable
virulence
of
envious
suspicion
,
until
an
accident
happen
,
which
have
well
-
nigh
overturn
the
bark
of
his
policy
,
and
induce
him
to
alter
the
course
,
that
he
may
not
be
shipwreck
on
the
rock
that
begin
to
multiply
in
the
prosecution
of
his
present
voyage
.
    
<EOS>
the
jeweller
,
who
,
as
a
German
,
want
neither
pride
nor
ostentation
,
never
fail
to
celebrate
the
anniversary
of
his
birth
,
by
an
annual
feast
grant
to
his
neighbour
and
friend
;
and
,
on
these
occasion
,
be
accustom
to
wear
that
chain
,
which
though
bequeath
to
his
daughter
,
he
consider
as
an
ornament
appertain
to
the
family
,
whereof
he
himself
be
head
:
accordingly
,
when
the
time
of
this
festival
revolve
,
he
,
as
usual
,
order
Wilhelmina
to
surrender
it
for
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
this
injunction
,
the
reader
will
perceive
,
our
young
lady
be
in
no
condition
to
obey
<EOS>
;
she
have
,
however
,
foresee
the
demand
,
and
contrive
a
scheme
of
behaviour
,
for
the
occasion
,
which
she
forthwith
put
in
execution
.
    
<EOS>
with
an
air
of
uncommon
chearfulness
purposely
assume
,
she
retire
to
her
closet
,
on
pretence
of
comply
with
his
desire
,
and
have
employ
a
few
minute
in
rummage
her
drawer
,
and
disorder
her
moveable
,
utter
a
loud
shriek
,
that
bring
her
father
instantly
into
the
apartment
,
where
he
find
his
daughter
toss
about
her
cloath
and
trinket
,
with
violent
demonstration
of
disorder
and
affright
,
and
hear
her
in
a
lamentable
strain
declare
,
that
she
be
rob
of
her
chain
,
and
for
ever
undo
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
so
far
from
be
an
agreeable
intimation
to
the
jeweller
,
that
he
be
strike
dumb
with
astonishment
and
vexation
,
and
it
be
not
till
after
a
long
pause
,
that
he
pronounce
the
word
"
sacrament
!
"
<EOS>
with
an
emphasis
,
denote
the
most
mortifying
surprize
.
    
<EOS>
soon
as
that
exclamation
escape
from
his
lip
,
he
fly
to
the
scrutore
as
if
instinctively
,
and
join
Wilhelmina
in
her
occupation
,
tumble
its
whole
content
upon
the
floor
in
a
trice
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
be
thus
employ
,
in
the
most
expressive
silence
,
the
wife
of
his
bosom
chance
to
pass
that
way
,
and
see
them
both
occupy
,
with
such
violence
and
trepidation
,
<EOS>
believe
at
first
,
that
they
be
certainly
actuate
by
the
spirit
of
frenzy
;
but
when
she
interpose
,
by
ask
with
great
earnestness
,
the
cause
of
such
transport
and
distract
behaviour
;
and
hear
her
husband
reply
with
an
accent
of
despair
,
"
the
chain
!
<EOS>
the
chain
of
my
forefather
be
no
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
immediately
justify
his
emotion
,
by
undergo
the
same
alarm
,
and
without
further
hesitation
,
engage
herself
in
the
search
,
begin
with
a
song
,
which
may
be
compare
to
the
hymn
of
battle
among
the
Greeks
,
or
rather
more
aptly
,
to
that
which
the
spartan
female
sing
round
the
altar
of
Diana
,
surname
Orthian
:
for
,
it
be
attend
with
strange
gesticulation
,
and
in
the
course
of
utterance
,
become
so
loud
and
shrill
,
that
the
guest
,
who
be
by
this
time
partly
assemble
,
be
confound
at
the
clamour
,
rush
towards
the
place
from
whence
<EOS>
it
seem
to
proceed
,
and
find
their
landlord
,
with
his
wife
and
daughter
in
the
attitude
of
distraction
and
despair
.
    
<EOS>
when
they
understand
the
nature
of
the
case
,
they
condole
the
family
on
their
misfortune
,
and
would
have
retire
,
on
the
supposition
that
it
would
defeat
the
mirthful
intent
of
their
meeting
;
but
the
jeweller
,
muster
up
his
whole
temper
and
hospitality
,
intreate
them
to
excuse
his
disorder
,
and
favour
him
with
their
company
,
which
,
he
observe
,
be
now
more
than
ever
want
,
to
dispel
the
melancholy
idea
inspire
by
his
loss
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
apology
,
and
the
effort
he
make
in
the
sequel
,
to
entertain
his
friend
with
jollity
and
good
humour
,
his
heart
be
so
link
to
the
chain
,
that
he
could
not
detach
himself
from
the
thought
of
it
,
which
invade
him
at
short
interval
,
in
such
qualm
as
effectually
spoil
his
appetite
,
and
hinder
his
digestion
.
    
<EOS>
He
revolve
within
himself
,
the
circumstance
of
his
disaster
,
and
in
canvass
all
the
probable
mean
,
by
which
the
chain
could
be
steal
,
conclude
that
the
deed
must
have
be
do
by
some
person
in
the

in

of
have

to
his

have
either
find
the

open
by
her
carelessness
and
neglect

or
find

<EOS>
His
suspicion
be
thus
confine
within
his
own
house
,
sometimes
pitch
upon
his
workman
,
and
sometimes
upon
his
wife
,
who
,
he
think
,
be
the
more
likely
to
practise
such
finesse
,
as
she
consider
Wilhelmina
in
the
light
of
a
daughter
-
in
-
law
,
whose
interest
interfere
with
her
own
,
and
who
have
often
harangue
to
him
in
private
,
on
the
folly
of
leave
this
very
chain
in
the
young
lady
's
possession
.
    
<EOS>
the
more
he
consider
this
subject
,
he
think
he
see
the
more
reason
to
attribute
the
damage
he
have
sustain
,
to
the
machination
of
his
spouse
,
who
,
he
do
not
doubt
,
be
dispose
to
feather
her
own
nest
,
at
the
expence
of
him
and
his
heir
,
and
who
,
with
the
same
honest
intention
,
have
already
secrete
,
for
her
private
use
,
those
inconsiderable
jewel
which
of
late
have
at
different
time
be
miss
.
 
<EOS>
arrouse
by
these
sentiment
,
he
resolve
to
retalliate
her
own
scheme
,
by
contrive
mean
to
visit
her
cabinet
in
secret
,
and
,
if
possible
,
to
rob
the
robber
,
of
the
spoil
she
have
gather
to
his
prejudice
,
without
come
to
any
explanation
,
which
may
end
in
domestic
turmoil
and
eternal
disquiet
.
    
<EOS>
while
the
husband
exercise
his
reflection
in
this
manner
,
his
innocent
mate
do
not
allow
the
power
of
her
imagination
to
rest
in
idleness
and
sloth
.
 
<EOS>
Her
observation
touch
the
loss
of
the
chain
be
such
,
as
a
suspicious
woman
,
bias
by
hatred
and
envy
,
would
naturally
make
.
 
<EOS>
to
her
it
seem
highly
improbable
,
that
a
thing
of
such
value
,
so
carefully
deposit
,
should
vanish
without
the
connivance
of
its
keeper
,
and
without
much
expence
of
conjecture
,
divine
the
true
manner
in
which
it
be
convey
.
 
<EOS>
the
sole
difficulty
that
occur
in
the
research
of
her
sagacity
,
be
to
know
the
gallant
,
who
have
be
favour
with
such
a
pledge
of
Wilhelmina
's
affection
;
for
as
the
reader
will
easily
imagine
,
she
never
dream
of
view
Ferdinand
in
that
odious
perspective
.
    
<EOS>
in
order
to
satisfy
her
curiosity
,
discover
this
happy
favourite
,
and
be
revenge
on
her
petulant
rival
,
she
prevail
upon
the
jeweller
to
employ
a
scout
,
who
should
watch
all
night
upon
the
stair
,
without
the
knowledge
of
any
other
person
in
the
family
,
alledging
,
that
,
in
all
livelihood
,
the
house
-
maid
give
private
admittance
to
some
lover
,
who
be
the
author
of
all
the
loss
they
have
lately
suffer
,
and
that
they
may
possibly
detect
him
in
his
nocturnal
adventure
;
and
observe
that
it
would
be
imprudent
to
intimate
their
design
to
Wilhelmina
,
lest
through
the
heedlessness
and
indiscretion
of
youth
,
she
may
chance
to
divulge
the
secret
,
so
as
to
frustrate
their
aim
.
    
<EOS>
a
Swiss
,
in
whose
honesty
the
German
could
confide
,
be
hire
for
this
purpose
,
be
post
in
a
dark
corner
of
the

without
perceive
the

on
the
fourth

the
evil

our

on
his
voyage
to

than
he
creep
softly
to
the
other
door
that

leave
open
for
the
purpose

and
give
immediate
intimation
of
what
he
have
perceive
:
this
intelligence
,
however
,
he
could
not
convey
so
secretly
,
but
the
lover
,
who
be
always
vigilant
upon
these
occasion
,
overhear
a
sort
of
commotion
in
the
jeweller
's
chamber
,
the
cause
of
which
their
apprehension
be
ingenious
enough
to
comprehend

<EOS>
We
have
formerly

that
our
adventurer
could
not
make
his
retreat
by
the
door
,
without
run
a
very
great
risque
of
be
detect
,
and
the
expedient
of
the
chimney
he
have
no
inclination
to
repeat
;
so
that
he
find
himself
in
a
very
uncomfortable
dilemma
,
and
be
utterly
abandon
by
all
his
invention
and
address
;
when
his
mistress
,
in
a
whisper
,
desire
him
to
begin
a
dialogue
,
aloud
,
in
an
apology
,
import
,
that
he
have
mistake
the
door

and
that
his

be
to
visit
her
father
,
touch
a
ring
belong
to
the
young
count
Melville
,
which
,
she

Fathom

put
into

in

<EOS>
Ferdinand
seize
the
hint
,
avail
himself
of
it
,
without
delay
,
and
unbolt
the
door
,
pronounce
,
in
an
audible
voice
,
"
upon
my
honour
,
Mademoiselle

you
wrong
my
intention
,
if
you
imagine
I
come
hither
with
any
disrespectful
or
dishonourable
motive
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
business
with
your
father
,
which
can
not
be
delay
till
to
-
morrow
,
without
manifest
prejudice
to
my
friend
and
myself
;
therefore
I
take
the
liberty
of
visit
him
at
these
untimely
hour
;
and
it
have
be
my
misfortune
to
mistake
the
door
in
the
dark
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
pardon
for
my
involuntary
intrusion
;
and
again
assure
you
,
that
nothing
be
farth
from
my
thought
,
than
any
design
to
violate
that
respect
which
I
have
always
entertain
for
you
and
your
father
's
family

"
    
<EOS>
to
this
remonstrance
,
which
be
distinctly
hear
by
the
german
and
his
wife
,
who
,
by
this
time
,
stand
listen
at
the
door
,
the
young
lady
reply
in
a
shrill
accent
of
displeasure
,
"
Sir
,
I
be
bind
to
believe
that
all
your
action
be
conduct
by
honour
;
but
,
you
must
give
me
leave
to
tell
you
,
that
your
mistake
be
a
little
extraordinary
,
and
your
visit
,
even
to
my
father
at
this
time
of
the
night
,
altogether
unseasonable
,
if
not
mysterious
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
the
interruption
I
have
suffer
in
my
repose
,
I
impute
it
to
my
own
forgetfulness
,
in
leave
my
door
unlock
,
and
blame
myself
so
severely
for
the
omission
that
I
shall
to
morrow
put
it
out
of
my
own
power
to
be
guilty
of
the
like
for
the
future
,
by
order
the
passage
to
be
nail
up
;
mean
while
,
if
you
would
persuade
me
of
your
well
-
mean
,
you
will
instantly
withdraw
,
lest
my
reputation
should
suffer
by
your
continuance
in
my
apartment
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
answer
our
hero
,
I
will
not
give
you
an
opportunity
to
repeat
the
command
,
which
I
shall
forthwith
obey
,
after
have
intreate
you
once
more
,
to
forgive
the
disturbance
I
have
give
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
gently
open
the
door
,
and
at
sight
of
the
german
and
his
wife
,
who
,
he
well
know
,
wait
for
his
exit
,
start
back
,
and
give
token
of
confusion
,
which
be
partly
real
,
and
partly
affect
.
 
<EOS>
the
jeweller
,
fully
satisfied
with
Fathom
's
declaration
to
his
daughter
,
receive
him
with
a
complaisant
look
,
and
in
order
to
alleviate
his
concern
,
give
him
to
understand
that
he
already
know
the
reason
of
his
being
in
that
apartment
,
and
desire
to
be
inform
of
what
have
procure
him
the
honour
to
see
him
at
such
a
juncture

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
,
say
our
adventurer
,
pretend
to
recollect
himself
with
difficulty
<EOS>
,
I
be
utterly
ashamed
and
confound
to
be
discover
in
this
situation
;
but
as
you
have
over
-
hear
what
past
between
Mademoiselle
and
me
,
I
know
you
will
do
justice
to
my
intention
and
forgive
my
mistake
.
    
<EOS>
after
beg
pardon
for
have
intrude
upon
your
family
at
these
hour
,
I
must
now
tell
you
,
that
my
cousin
count
<EOS>
Melville
be
sometime
ago
so
much
misrepresented
to
his
mother
,
by
certain
malicious
informer
,
who
delight
in
sow
discord
in
private
family
,
that
she
actually
believe
her
son
an
extravagant
spendthrift
,
who
have
not
only
consume
his
remittance
in
the
most
riotous
scene
of
disorder
,
but
also
indulge
a
pernicious
appetite
for
game
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
have
lose
all
his
cloath
and
jewel
at
play
.
 
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
such
false
information
,
she
expostulate
with
him
in
a
severe
letter
,
and
desire
he
would
transmit
to
her
that
ring
which
be
in
your
custody
,
it
be
a
family
stone
,
for
which
she
express
an
inestimable
value
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
,
in
his
answer
to
her
reproof
,
endeavour
to
vindicate
himself
from
the
aspersion
which
have
be
cast
upon
his
character
,
and
with
regard
to
the
ring
,
tell
her
it
be
at
present
in
the
hand
of
a
jeweller
,
in
order
to
be
new
set
,
accord
to
her
own
direction
,
and
that
whenever
it
should
be
alter
,
he
would
send
it
home
to
her
by
some
safe
conveyance
.
 
<EOS>
this
account
the
good
lady
take
for
an
evasion
,
and
upon
that
supposition
,
have
again
write
to
him
,
in
such
a
provoking
stile
,
that
although
the
letter
arrive
but
half
an
hour
ago
,
he
be
determined
to
dispatch
a
courier
before
morning
with
the
mischievous
ring
,
for
which
,
in
compliance
with
the
impetuosity
of
his
temper
,
I
have
take
the
freedom
to
disturb
you
at
this
unseasonable
hour
.
    
<EOS>
the
German
pay
implicit
faith
to
every
circumstance
of
this
story
,
which
indeed
could
not
well
be
suppose
to
be
invent
extempore
;
the
ring
be
immediately
restore
,
and
our
adventurer
take
his
leave
,
congratulate
himself
upon
his
signal
deliverance
from
the
snare
in
which
he
have
fall
.
     
<EOS>
the
step
-
dame
's
suspicion
be
awaken
<EOS>
,
she
lay
a
snare
for
our
adventurer
,
from
which
he
be
deliver
by
the
interposition
of
his
good
genius
.
   
<EOS>
though
the
husband
swallow
the
bait
,
without
further
inquiry
,
the
penetration
of
the
wife
be
not
so
easily
deceive
:
that
same
dialogue
in
Wilhelmina
's
apartment
,
far
from
allay
,
rather
inflame
her
suspicion
,
because
,
in
the
like
emergency
,
she
herself
have
once
profit
by
the
same
,
or
nearly
the
same
contrivance
.
 
<EOS>
without
communicate
her
doubt
to
the
father
,
she
resolve
to
double
her
attention
to
the
daughter
's
future
conduct
,
and
keep
such
a
strict
eye
over
the
behaviour
of
our
gallant
,
that
he
should
find
it
very
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
,
to
elude
her
observation
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
purpose
,
she
take
into
her
pay
an
old
maiden
,
of
the
right
sour
disposition
,
who
live
in
an
house
opposite
to
her
own
,
and
direct
her
to
follow
the
young
lady
in
all
her
out
-
going
,
whenever
she
should
receive
from
the
window
a
certain
signal
,
which
the
mother
-
in
law
agree
to
make
for
the
occasion
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
before
this
scheme
succeed
to
her
wish
:
the
door
of
communication
,
betwixt
Wilhelmina
's
apartment
and
the
stair
case
,
be
nail
up
by
the
jeweller
's
express
order
,
our
adventurer
be
altogether
deprive
of
those
opportunity
he
have
hitherto
enjoy
;
and
be
not
at
all
mortify
to
find
himself
so
restrict
,
in
a
correspondence
which
begin
to
be
tiresome
and
disagreeable
:
but
the
case
be
far
otherwise
with
his
Dulcinea
,
whose
passion
,
the
more
it
be
thwart
,
rage
with
great
violence
,
like
a
fire
,
that
from
the
attempt
that
be
make
to
extinguish
it
,
gather
great
force
,
and
flame
with
double
fury
.
    
<EOS>
upon
the
second
day
of
her
misfortune
,
she
have
write
a
very
tender
billet
,
lament
her
unhappiness
,
in
be
deprive
of
those
meeting
which
constitute
the
chief
joy
of
her
life
,
and
intreate
him
to
contrive
some
mean
of
renew
the
delicious
commerce
in
an
unsuspected
place
.
 
<EOS>
this
intimation
she
propose
to
convey
privately
into
the
hand
of
her
lover
,
during
his
next
visit
to
the
family
;
but
both
be
so
narrowly
eyed
by
the
mother
,
that
she
find
the
execution
of
her
design
impracticable
;
and
next
forenoon
,
on
pretence
of
go
to
church
,
repair
to
the
house
of
a
companion
,
who
be
also
her
confidante

undertake
to
deliver
the
billet
with
her
own
hand

in
obedience
to
the
sign
,
which
be

from
the
window
,
immediately
put
on
her
veil
,
and
follow
Wilhelmina
at
a
distance
,
until
she
see
her
fairly
house
:
she
would
not
even
then
return
from
her
excursion
,
but
hover
about
in
sight
of
the
door
,
with
a
view
of
make
further
observation
:
in
less
than
five
minute
after
,
the
young
lady
disappear
,
the
scout
perceive
her
come
out
,
accompany
by
her
comerade
,
from
whom
she
instantly
part
,
and
bend
her
way
towards
the
church
in
good
earnest
,
while
the
other
steer
her
course
in
another
direction
.
 
<EOS>
the
duenna
,
after
a
moment
's
suspence
and
consideration
,
divine
the
true
cause
of
this
short
visit
,
and
resolve
to
watch
the
motion
of
the
confidante
,
whom
she
trace
to
the
academy
in
which
our
hero
lodge
,
and
from
which
she
see
her
return
,
after
the
suppose
message
be
deliver
.
    
<EOS>
Fraught
with
this
intelligence
,
the
rancorous
understrapper
,
hie
her
home
to
the
jeweller
's
wife
,
and
make
a
faithful
recital
of
what
she
have
see
;
communicate
at
the
same
time
,
her
own
conjecture
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
Her
employer
be
equally
astonished
and
incense
at
this
information
:
she
be
seize
with
all
that
frenzy
which
take
possession
of
a
slight
woman
,
when
she
find
herself
supplant
by
a
detest
rival
;
and
in
the
first
transport
of
her
indignation
,
devote
them
as
sacrifice
to
her
vengeance
:
nor
be
her
surprise
so
much
the
effect
of
his
dissimulation
,
as
of
his
want
of
taste
and
discernment
.
 
<EOS>
She
inveigh
against
him
,
not
as
the
most
treacherous
lover
,
but
as
the
most
abject
wretch
,
in
court
the
smile
of
such
an
aukward
dowdy
,
while
he
enjoy
the
favour
of
a
woman
,
who

consult
her
own
satisfaction

by
flatter
the

and
so
unaccountable
do
the
depravity
of
our
hero
's
judgment
appear
to
this
conceited
dame
,
that
she
begin
to
believe
there
be
some
mistake
in
the
person

and
to
hope
that
Wilhelmina
's
gallant
be
not

reality

rather

back
to

an

an
expedition

would
have
willingly
dispense

because
it
be
found
upon
an
uncertainty

may

to

the
lady
relish

proposal

resolve
to
make
an
assignation
with
Ferdinand

as
usual
,

give
notice
of
the
appointment
to
her
husband

that
he
may
personally
discover
the
treachery

his
pretended
friend

inflict
upon
him
such
chastisement

as
the

's
brutal
disposition

when
inflame
by
that
specie

provocation

<EOS>
have
this
project
be
bring
to
bear
,
Ferdinand
,
in
all
likelihood
,
would
have
be
disqualify
from

in
any

intrigue

but
fate
ordain
,
that
the
design
should
be
defeat
,
in
order
to
reserve
him
for
more
important
occasion
.
    
<EOS>
before
the
circumstance
of
the
plan
could
be
adjust
,
it
be
his
good
fortune
to
meet
his
Dulcinea
in
the
street
,
and
in
the
midst
of
their
mutual
condolance
on
the
interruption
they
have
suffer
in

correspondence

he
assure
her

that
he
would
never

respite

until
he
should
have
verify
the
protestation
contain
in
the
letter
he
have
deliver
to
her
discreet
agent
.
 
<EOS>
this
allusion
to
a
billet
she
have
never
receive
,
do
not
fail
to
alarm
her
fear
,
and
introduce
a
very
mortifying
explanation
,
in
which
he
so
accurately
describe
the
person
of
the
messenger
,
that
she
forthwith
comprehend
the
plot
,
and
communicate
to
our
hero
her
sentiment
on
that
subject
.
    
<EOS>
though
he
express
infinite
anxiety
and
chagrin
at
this
misfortune
,
which
could
not
fail
to
raise
new
obstacle
to
their
love
,
his
heart
be
a
stranger
to
the
uneasiness
he
affect
;
and
rather
pleased
with
the
occasion
,
which
would
furnish
him
with
pretence
to
withdraw
himself
gradually
,
from
an
intercourse
by
this
time
<EOS>
become
equally
cloying
and
unprofitable
.
 
<EOS>
be
well
acquaint
with
the
mother
's
temperament
,
he
guess
the
present
situation
of
her
thought
,
and
conclude
she
would
make
the
jeweller
a
party
in
her
revenge
<EOS>
,
he
resolve
from
that
moment
to
discontinue
his
visit
,
and
cautiously
guard
against
any
future
interview
with
the
lady
,
whom
he
have
render
so
implacable
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
well
for
our
adventurer
,
that
his
good
fortune
so
seasonably
interpose
;
for
that
same
day
,
in
the
afternoon
,
he
be
favour
with
a
billet
from
the
jeweller
's
wife
,
couch
in
the
same
tender
stile
she
have
formerly
use
,
and
import
an
earnest
desire
of
see
him
next
day
,
at
the
wonte
rendezvous
.
    
<EOS>
Altho
'
his
penetration
be
sufficient
to
perceive
the
drift
of
this
message
;
or
at
least
,
to
discern
the
risque
he
should
run
,
in
comply
with
her
request
,
yet
he
be
willing
to
be
more
fully
certify
of
the
truth
of
his
suspicion
,
and
write
an
answer
to
the
billet
,
in
which
he
assure
her
that
he
would
repair
to
the
place
of
appointment
,
with
all
the
punctuality
of
an
impatient
lover
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
instead
of
perform
this
promise
,
he
,
in
the
morning
,
take
post
in
a
public
house
opposite
to
the
place
of
assignation
,
in
order
to
reconnoitre
the
ground
,
and
about
noon
have
the
pleasure
of
see
the
German
wrap
in
a
cloak
,
enter
the
door
of
his
wife
's
she
-
friend
,
though
the
appointment
be
fix
at
five
in
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Fathom
bless
his
good
angel
,
for
have
conduct
him
clear
of
this
conspiracy
,
and
keep
his
station
with
great
tranquillity
,
till
the
hour
of
meeting
,
when
he
behold
his
enraged
Thalestris
take
the
same
route
,
and
enjoy
her
disappointment
with
ineffable
satisfaction
.
    
<EOS>
thus
favour
with
a
pretext
,
he
take
his
leave
of
her
,
in
a
letter
,
give
her
to
understand
,
that
he
be
no
stranger
to
the
barbarous
snare
she
have
lay
for
him
;
and
upbraid
her
with
have
make
such
an
ungrateful
return
for
all
his
tenderness
and
attachment
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
not
backward
in
convey
a
reply
to
this
expostulation
,
which
seem
to
have
be
dictate
in
all
the
distraction
of
a
proud
woman
,
who
fee
her
vengeance
baffle
,
as
well
as
her
love
disdain
.
 
<EOS>
Her
letter
be
nothing
but
a
succession
of
reproach
,
menace
,
and
incoherent
execration
.
    
<EOS>
She
tax
him
with
knavery
,
insensibility
and
dissimulation
;
imprecate
a
thousand
curse
upon
his
head
,
and
threaten
not
only
to
persecute
his
life
with
all
the
art
that
hell
and
malice
could
inspire
,
but
also
to
wound
him
in
the
person
of
her
daughter
-
in
-
law
,
who
should
be
inclose
for
life
in
a
convent
,
where
she
would
have
leisure
to
repent
of
those
loose
and
disorderly
practice
,
which
he
have
teach
her
to
commit
,
and
of
which
she
could
not
pretend
innocence
,
as
they
have
it
in
their
power
to
confront
her
with
the
evidence
of
her
lover
's
own
confession
.
 
<EOS>
yet
all
this
denunciation
be
qualified
with
an
alternative
,
by
which
he
be
give
to
understand
,
that
the
gate
of
mercy
be
still
open
,
and
that
penitence
be
capable
of
wash
out
the
deep
stain
of
guilt
.
    
<EOS>
Ferdinand
read
the
whole
remonstrance
with
great
composure
and
moderation
,
and
be
content
to
incur
the
hazard
of
her
hate
,
rather
than
put
her
to
the
trouble
of
make
such
an
effort
of
generosity
,
as
would
induce
her
to
forgive
the
heinous
offence
he
have
commit
;
nor
do
his
apprehension
for
Wilhelmina
in
the
least
influence
his
behaviour
on
this
occasion
:
<EOS>
so
zealous
be
he
for
her
spiritual
concern
,
that
he
would
have
be
glad
to
hear
she
have
actually
take
the
veil
;
but
he
know
such
a
step
be
not
at
all
agreeable
to
her
disposition
,
and
that
no
violence
would
be
offer
to
her
inclination
on
that
score
,
unless
her
step
-
mother
should
communicate
to
the
father
that
letter
of
Fathom
which
she
have
intercept
,
and
by
which
the
German
would
be
convince
of
his
daughter
's
backsliding
;
but
this
measure
,
he
rightly
suppose
,
the
wife
would
not
venture
to
take
,
lest
the
husband
,
instead
of
take
her
advice
,
touch
the
young
lady
,
should
seek
to
compromise
the
affair
,
by
offer
her
in
marriage
to
her
debaucher
;
a
proffer
,
which
,
if
accept
,
would
overwhelm
the
mother
with
vexation
and
despair
.
    
<EOS>
He
therefore
choose
to
trust
to
the
effect
of
lenient
time
,
which
he
hope
would
gradually
weaken
the
resentment
of
this
Penthesilea
,
and
dissolve
his
connection
with
the
other
part
of
the
family
,
from
which
he
long
to
be
totally
detach
.
    
<EOS>
how
well
soever
he
may
have
succeed
in
his
attempt
to
shake
off
the
yoke
of
the
mother
,
who
by
her
situation
in
life
be
restrain
from
prosecute
those
measure
her
resentment
have
plan
against
his
fortitude
and
indifference
;
he
would
have
find
great
difficulty
than
he
have
foresee
,
in
disengage
himself
from
the
daughter
,
whose
affection
he
have
win
under
the
most
solemn
profession
of
honour
and
fidelity
;
and
who
,
now
she
be
debar
of
his
company
and
conversation
,
and
in
danger
of
lose
him
for
ever
,
have
actually
take
the
resolution
of
disclose
the
amour
to
her
father
,
that
he
may
interpose
in
behalf
of
her
peace
and
reputation
,
and
secure
her
happiness
by
the
sanction
of
the
church
.
     
<EOS>
Our
hero
depart
from
Vienna
,
and
quit
the
domain
of
Venus
for
the
rough
field
of
Mars
.
   
<EOS>
luckily
for
our
adventurer
,
before
he
adhere
to
this
determination
,
the
young
count
de
Melvile
be
summon
to
Presburg
by
his
father

who
desire
to
see
him
,
before
he
should
take
the
field
,
in
consequence
of
a
rupture
between
the
emperor
and
the
french
king

and
Fathom
of
course
quit
Vienna
,
in
order
to
attend
his
patron
,
after

two
whole

in

where

perfect
in
all
the
polite

,
become
master
of
the
french
tongue
,
and
learn
to
speak
the
Italian
with
great
facility
;
over
and
above
those
other
accomplishment
in
which
we
have
represent
him
as
an
inimitable
original
.
    
<EOS>
as
for
the
young
count
,
his
exterior
be
so
much
improve
by
the
company
to
which
he
have
access
,
since
his
departure
from
his
father
's
house
,
that
his
parent
be
equally
surprised
and
overjoy
at
the
alteration
.
 
<EOS>
all
that
aukwardness
and
rusticity
,
which
hang
upon
his
deportment
,
be
,
like
the
rough
coat
of
a
diamond
,
polish
away
;
the
connection
and
disposition
of
his
limb
seem
to
have
be
adjust
anew
;
his
carriage
be
become
easy
,
his
air
perfectly
genteel
,
and
his
conversation
gay
and
unrestrained
.
 
<EOS>
the
merit
of
this
reformation
be
in
a
great
measure
ascribe
to
the
care
and
example
of
Mr
Fathom
,
who
be
receive
by
the
old
count
and
his
lady
with
mark
of
singular
friendship
and
esteem
;
nor
be
he
overlook
by
Mademoiselle
,
who
still
remain
in
a
state
of
celibacy
.
<EOS>
and
seem
to
have
resign
all
hope
of
alter
her
condition
;
she
express
uncommon
satisfaction
at
the
return
of
her
old
favourite
,
and
re
-
admit
him
into
the
same
degree
of
familiarity
with
which
he
have
be
honour
before
his
departure
.
    
<EOS>
the
joy
of
Teresa
be
so
excessive
at
his
arrival
,
that
she
could
scarce
suppress
her
rapture
,
so
as
to
conceal
them
from
the
notice
of
the
family
;
and
our
hero
,
upon
this
occasion
,
perform
the
part
of
an
exquisite
actor
,
in
dissemble
those
transport
which
his
bosom
never
know
.
 
<EOS>
so
well
have
this
pupil
retain
the
lesson
of
her
instructor
,
that
,
in
the
midst
of
those
fraudulent
appropriation
,
which
she
still
continue
to
make
,
she
have
find
mean
to
support
her
interest
and
character
with
Mademoiselle
,
and
even
to
acquire
such
influence
in
the
family
,
that
no
other
servant
,
male
or
female
,
could
pretend
to
live
under
the
same
roof
,
without
pay
incessant
homage
to
this
artful
wait
woman
,
and
yield
the
most
abject
submission
to
her
will
.
    
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
have
tarry
at
Presburg
about
six
week
,
during
which
a
small
field
equipage
be
prepare
for
Renaldo
,
they
repair
to
the
camp
at
Heilbron
,
under
the
auspex
of
count
Melvile
,
in
whose
regiment
they
carry
arm
,
as
volunteer
,
with
a
view
to
merit
promotion
in
the
service
,
by
their
own
personal
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
would
have
willingly
dispense
with
this
occasion
of
signalize
himself
,
his
talent
be
much
better
adapt
to
another
sphere
of
life
;
nevertheless
,
he
affect
uncommon
alacrity
at
the
prospect
of
gather
laurel
in
the
field
,
and
subscribe
to
his
fortune
with
a
good
grace
;
foresee
that
,
even
in
a
campaigne
,
a
man
of
his
art
and
ingenuity
may
find
mean
to
consult
his
corporal
safety
,
without
any
danger
to
his
reputation
.
    
<EOS>
accordingly
,
before
he
have
live
full
three
week
in
camp
,
the
damp
situation
and
sudden
change
in
his
way
of
life
,
have
such
a
violent
effect
upon
his
constitution
,
that
he
be
deprive
of
the
use
of
all
his
limb
,
and
mourn
without
cease
,
his
hard
fate
,
by
which
he
find
himself
preclude
from
all
opportunity
of
exert
his
dilligence
,
courage
and
activity
,
in
the
character
of
a
soldier
,
to
which
he
now
aspire
.
    
<EOS>
Renaldo
,
who
be
actually
enamour
of
a
martial
life
,
and
miss
no
occasion
of
distinguish
himself
,
console
his
companion
,
with
great
cordiality
,
encourage
him
with
the
hope
of
see
his
constitution
familiarize
to
the
inconveniencie
of
a
camp
,
and
accommodate
him
with
every
thing
which
he
think
would
alleviate
the
pain
of
his
body
,
as
well
as
the
anxiety
of
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
count
,
who
sincerely
sympathize
with
his
affliction
,
would
have
persuade
him
to
retire
into
quarter
,
where
he
could
be
carefully
nurse
,
and
provide
with
every
thing
necessary
to
a
person
in
his
condition
;
but
,
such
be
his
desire
of
glory
,
that
he
resist
his
patron
's
importunity
,
with
great
constancy
,
till
at
length
,
see
the
old
gentleman
obstinately
determine
to
consult
his
health
,
by
remove
him
from
the
field
,
he
gradually
suffer
himself
to
recover
the
use
of
his
hand
,
make
shift
to
sit
up
in
his
bed
,
and
amuse
himself
with
card
or
back
gammon
,
and
notwithstanding
the
feeble
condition
of
his
leg
,
venture
to
ride
out
on
horseback
,
to
visite
the
line
;
though
the
count
and
his
son
would
never
yield
to
his
solicitation
so
far
,
as
to
let
him
accompany
Renaldo
in
those
excursion
and
reconnoitre
party
by
which
a
volunteer
inure
himself
to
toil
and
peril
,
and
acquire
that
knowledge
in
the
operation
of
war
,
which
qualify
him
for
a
command
in
the
service
.
    
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
exemption
from
all
duty
,
our
adventurer
manage
matter
so
as
to
pass
for
a
youth
of
infinite
mettle
,
and
even
render
his
backwardness
and
timidity
subservient
to
the
support
of
that
character
,
by
express
an
impatience
of
lie
inactive
,
and
a
desire
of
signalize
his
prowess
,
which
even
the
disabled
condition
of
his
body
could
scarce
restrain
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
be
a
man
of
very
weak
nerve
and
excessive
irresolution
,
who
can
live
in
the
midst
of
actual
service
,
without
imbibe
some
portion
of
military
fortitude
<EOS>
;
danger
become
habitual
,
and
lose
a
great
part
of
its
terror
;
and
as
fear
be
often
catch
by
contagion
,
so
be
courage
communicate
among
the
individual
of
an
army
.
 
<EOS>
the
hope
of
fame
,
desire
of
honour
and
preferment
,
envy
,
emulation
,
and
the
dread
of
disgrace
,
be
motive
which
co
-
operate
in
suppress
that
aversion
to
death
or
mutilation
,
which
nature
hath
implant
in
the
human
mind
;
and
therefore
,
it
be
not
to
be
wonder
at
,
if
Fathom
,
who
be
naturally
chicken
-
hearted
,
gain
some
advantage
over
his
disposition
,
before
the
end
of
the
campaign
,
which
happen
to
be
neither
perilous
nor
severe
.
    
<EOS>
during
the
winter
,
while
both
army
remain
in
quarter
,
our
adventurer
attend
his
patron
to
Presburgh
,
and
before
the
troop
be
in
motion
,
Renaldo
obtain
a
commission
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
go
into
garrison
at
Philipsburg
,
whither
he
be
follow
by
our
hero
,
while
the
old
count
's
duty
call
him
to
the
field
in
a
different
place
.
    
<EOS>
Ferdinand
,
for
some
time
have
no
reason
to
be
dissatisfy
with
this
disposition
,
by
which
he
be
at
once
deliver
from
the
fatigue
of
a
campaign
,
and
the
inspection
of
a
severe
censor
,
in
the
person
of
count
Melvile
;
and
his
satisfaction
be
still
increase
by
an
accidental
meeting
with
the
Tyrolese
,
who
have
be
his
confederate
at
Vienna
,
and
now
chance
to
serve
in
garrison
,
on
the
same
footing
with
himself
.
 
<EOS>
these
two
knight
-
errant
renew
their
former
correspondence
,
and
as
all
soldier
be
addict
to
game
,
levy
contribution
upon
all
those
officer
who
have
money
to
lose
,
and
temerity
to
play
.
    
<EOS>
however
they
have
not
long
pursue
this
branch
of
traffic
,
when
their
success
be
interrupt
by
a
very
serious
occurrence
,
that
for
the
present
intirely
detach
the
gentleman
in
the
garrison
from
such
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
the
french
troop
invest
Fort
Kehl
,
situate
on
the
Rhine
,
opposite
to
Strasburg
,
and
the
Imperialists
,
dread
that
the
next
storm
would
fall
upon
Philipsburgh
,
employ
themselves
with
great
diligence
,
to
put
that
important
fortress
in
a
proper
posture
of
defence
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
suspension
of
play
be
displease
to
our
hero
,
the
expectation
of
be
besiege
be
by
no
mean
more
agreeable
.
    
<EOS>
He
know
the
excellence
of
the
french
engineer
,
the
power
of
their
artillery
,
and
the
perseverance
of
their
general
:
<EOS>
she
feel
,
by
anticipation
,
the
toil
of
hard
duty
upon
the
work
,
the
horror
of
night
alarm
,
cannonading
,
bombardment
,
sally
and
mine
blow
up
;
and
deliberate
with
himself
,
whether
or
not
he
should
privately
withdraw
,
and
take
refuge
among
the
besieger
;
but
,
when
he
reflect
that
such
a
step
,
besides
the
infamy
that
must
attend
it
,
would
be
like
that
of
run
upon
Scylla
,
seek
to
avoid
Charybdis
,
as
he
would
be
expose
to
more
danger
and
inconvenience
in
the
trench
,
than
he
could
possibly
undergo
in
the
town
,
and
after
all
run
the
risque
of
be
take
and
treat
as
a
deserter
;
upon
these
consideration
,
he
resolve
to
submit
himself
to
his
destiny
,
and
endeavour
to
mitigate
the
rigour
of
his
fate
,
by
those
art
he
have
formerly
practise
with
success
.
 
<EOS>
He
accordingly
find
mean
to
enjoy
a
very
bad
state
of
health
during
the
whole
siege
,
which
last
about
six
week
after
the
trench
be
open
;
and
then
the
garrison
march
out
by
capitulation
,
with
all
the
honour
of
war
.
     
<EOS>
He
put
himself
under
the
guidance
of
his
associate
,
and
stumble
upon
the
french
camp
,
where
he
finish
his
military
career
.
   
<EOS>
nothing
else
of
moment
be
transact
during
that
campaign
;
and
in
the
winter
,
our
adventurer
,
with
the
young
count
,
and
his
friend
the
Tyrolese
,
be
dispose
in
quarter
of
cantonment
,
where
Ferdinand
make
himself
amend
for
the
chagrin
he
have
undergo
,
by
the
exercise
of
those
talent
in
which
he
excel
.
 
<EOS>
not
that
he
be
satisfied
with
the
sphere
of
life
in
which
he
act
;
though
he
know
himself
consummate
in
the
art
of
play
,
he
be
not
at
all
ambitious
of
a
gamester
's
name
;
nor
do
he
find
himself
disposed
to
hazard
those
discovery
and
explanation
to
which
hero
of
that
class
be
sometimes
necessarily
expose
.
    
<EOS>
His
aim
be
to
dwell
among
the
tent
of
civil
life
,
undisturbed
by
quarrel
and
the
din
of
war
,
and
render
mankind
subservient
to
his
interest
,
not
by
stratagem
which
irritate
,
but
by
that
suppleness
of
insinuation
,
which
could
not
fail
to
sooth
the
temper
of
those
on
whom
he
mean
to
prey
.
    
<EOS>
He
see
that
all
his
expectation
of
count
Melvile
's
future
favour
,
be
connect
with
his
choice
of
a
military
life
;
and
that
his
promotion
in
the
service
would
,
in
a
great
measure
,
depend
upon
his
personal
behaviour
in
such
emergency
as
he
do
not
at
all
wish
to
encounter
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
he
confide
so
much
in
his
own
dexterity
and
address
,
that
he
never
doubt
of
be
able
to
rear
a
splendid
fortune
for
himself
,
provide
he
could
once
obtain
a
fixed
and
firm
foundation
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
in
fancy
,
often
enjoy
a
prospect
of
England
,
not
only
as
his
native
country
,
to
which
,
like
a
true
citizen
,
he
long
to
be
unite
;
but
also
as
the
land
of
promise
,
flow
with
milk
and
honey
,
and
abound
with
subject
on
which
he
know
his
talent
would
be
properly
exercise
.
    
<EOS>
these
reflection
never
occur
,
without
leave
a
strong
impression
upon
the
mind
of
our
adventurer
,
which
influence
his
deliberation
,
in
such
a
manner
,
as
at
length
amount
to
a
perfect
resolution
of
withdraw
himself
privately
from
a
service
that
teem
with
disagreeable
event
;
and
of
transport
himself
into
the
country
of
his
ancestor
,
which
he
consider
as
the
Canaan
of
all
able
adventurer
.
    
<EOS>
but
previous
to
his
appearance
on
that
stage
,
he
be
desirous
of
visit
the
metropolis
of
France
,
in
which
he
hope
to
improve
himself
in
the
knowledge
of
man
and
thing
,
and
acquire
such
intelligence
as
would
qualify
him
to
act
a
more
important
part
upon
the
british
scene
.
 
<EOS>
after
have
for
some
time
indulge
these
prospect
in
secret
,
he
determine
to
accommodate
himself
with
the
company
and
experience
of
the
Tyrolese
,
whom
,
under
the
specious
title
of
an
associate
,
he
know
he
could
convert
into
a
very
serviceable
tool
,
in
forward
the
execution
of
his
own
project
.
    
<EOS>
accordingly
,
the
inclination
of
this
confederate
be
found
by
distant
hint
,
and
be
find
apt
,
our
hero
make
him
privy
to
his
design
of
decamp
without
beat
of
drum
;
though
,
at
the
same
time
,
he
beg
his
advice
,
touch
the
method
of
their
departure
,
that
he
may
retire
with
as
much
delicacy
as
the
nature
of
such
a
step
would
permit
.
 
<EOS>
diver
consultation
be
hold
upon
this
subject
,
before
they
adhere
to
the
resolution
of
make
their
escape
from
the
army
,
after
it
should
have
take
the
field
in
the
spring
;
because
,
in
that
case
,
they
would
have
frequent
opportunity
of
go
abroad
on
forage
party
,
and
during
one
of
these
excursion
,
may
retire
in
such
a
manner
,
as
to
persuade
their
companion
,
that
they
have
fall
into
the
enemy
's
hand
.
    
<EOS>
agreeable
to
this
determination
,
the
camp
be
no
sooner
form
in
Alsace
,
than
our
associate
begin
to
make
preparation
for
their
march
,
and
have
already
take
all
the
previous
measure
for
their
departure
,
when
an
accident
happen
,
which
our
hero
do
not
fail
to
convert
to
his
own
advantage
:
this
be
no
other
than
the
desertion
of
Renaldo
's
valet
,
who
,
in
consequence
of
a
gentle
chastisement
,
which
he
have
richly
merit
,
think
proper
to
disappear
,
after
have
plunder
his
master
's
portmanteau
,
which
he
have
force
open
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Ferdinand
,
who
be
the
first
person
that
discover
the
theft
,
immediately
comprehend
the
whole
adventure
,
and
take
it
for
grant
,
that
the
delinquent
would
never
return
,
resolve
to
finish
what
the
fugitive
have
imperfectly
perform
.
    
<EOS>
be
favour
with
the
unreserved
confidence
of
the
young
count
,
he
instantly
have
recourse
to
his
bureau
,
the
lock
of
which
he
find
mean
to
burst
open
,
and
examine
a
private
drawer
,
contrive
with
great
art
to
conceal
Renaldo
's
jewel
and
cash
,
make
himself
master
of
the
content
without
hesitation
;
then
cut
open
his
cloak
-
bag
,
and
strew
the
tent
with
his
linen
and
cloath
,
begin
to
raise
his
voice
,
and
produce
such
a
clamour
as
alarm
the
whole
neighbourhood
,
and
bring
a
great
many
officer
into
the
tent
.
    
<EOS>
He
on
this
,
as
on
all
other
occasion
,
perform
his
cue
to
a
miracle
,
express
confusion
and
concern
<EOS>
so
naturally
,
in
his
gesture
and
exclamation
,
that
no
man
could
possibly
suspect
his
sincerity
;
nay
,
to
such
a
degree
of
finesse
do
his
cunning
amount
,
that
when
his
friend
and
patron
enter
,
in
consequence
of
an
intimation
he
soon
receive
of
his
loss
,
our
adventurer
exhibit
undoubted
sign
of
distraction
and
delirium
,
and
spring
upon
Renaldo
with
all
the
frantic
fury
of
a
bedlamite
,
"
Villain
,
"
cry
he
,
"
restore
the
effect
you

"
 
<EOS>
however
mortify
M
de
Melvile
may
be
,
at
his
own
misfortune
,
the
condition
of
his
friend
seem
to
touch
him
more
nearly
;
he
undervalue
his
own
loss
,
as
a
trifle
that
could
be
easily
repair
,
say
every
thing
which
he
think
would
tend
to
sooth
and
compose
the
agitation
of
Ferdinand
,
and
finally
prevail
upon
him
to
retire
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
the
calamity
be
wholly
attribute
to
the
deserter
,
and
Renaldo
,
far
from
suspect
the
true
author
,
take
occasion
,
from
his
behaviour
on
this
emergency
,
to
admire
him
as
a
mirrour
of
integrity
and
attachment
;
in
such
an
exquisite
manner
do
he
plan
all
his
design
,
that
almost
every
instance
of
his
fraud
furnish
matter
of
triumph
to
his
reputation
.
    
<EOS>
have
thus
profitably
exercise
his
genius
,
this
subtle
politician
think
it
high
time
to
relinquish
his
military
expectation
,
and
secure
all
his
valuable
acquisition
about
his
own
person
,
ride
out
with
his
understrapper
,
in
the
midst
of
fifty
dragoon
who
go
in
quest
of
forage
.
 
<EOS>
while
the
trooper
be
employ
in
make
up
their
truss
,
the
two
adventurer
advance
towards
the
skirt
of
a
wood
,
on
pretence
of
reconnoitering
,
and
the
Tyroleze
,
who
undertake
to
be
our
hero
's
guide
,
direct
him
to
a
path
which
lead
towards
Strasburg
,
they
suddenly
vanish
from
the
eye
of
their
companion
,
who
in
a
few
minute
hear
the
report
of
several
pistol
,
which
the
confederate
purposely
fire
,
conjecture
that
they
have
fall
in
with
a
party
of
French
,
by
whom
they
be
make
prisoner
of
war
.
    
<EOS>
the
Tyroleze
have
over
-
rate
his
own
knowlege
,
when
he
take
upon
himself
the
charge
of
conduct
our
hero
;
for
,
upon
their
arrival
at
a
certain
place
,
where
two
road
cross
each
other
,
he
chance
to
follow
that
which
not
only
frustrate
their
intention
,
but
even
lead
them
directly
to
the
french
camp
:
so
that
in
the
twilight
they
fall
in
upon
one
of
the
outguard
,
before
they
be
aware
of
their
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
confusion
and
perplexity
they
may
undergo
,
when
they
hear
themselves
question
by
the
centinel
on
the
advanced
post
,
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
they
betray
no
symptom
of
fear
or
disorder
;
but
while
Ferdinand
endeavour
to
recollect
himself
,
his
fellow
traveller
,
with
the
appearance
of
admirable
intrepidity
and
presence
of
mind
,
tell
the
soldier
,
that
he
and
his
companion
be
two
gentleman
of
family
,
who
have
quit
the
austrian
army
,
on
account
of
have
sustain
some
ill
usage
,
which
they
have
no
opportunity
of
resent
in
any
other
way
;
and
that
they
be
come
to
offer
their
service
to
the
french
general
,
to
whose
quarter
they
desire
to
be
immediately
convey
.
    
<EOS>
the
centinel
,
to
whom
such
an
instance
of
desertion
be
neither
rare
,
nor
indeed
uncommon
,
direct
them
without
scruple
to
the
next
post
,
where
they
find
a
serjeant
's
party
,
from
which
,
at
their
request
,
they
be
transmit
to
the
officer
of
the
grand
guard
,
and
by
him
,
next
morning
,
introduce
to
count
Coigny
,
who
very
politely
receive
them
as
volunteer
in
the
army
of
France
.
    
<EOS>
though
this
translation
be
not
at
all
to
our
hero
's
liking
,
he
be
force
to
acquiesce
in
his
fate
,
glad
to
find
himself
,
on
these
term
,
in
possession
of
his
effect
,
of
which
he
would
otherwise
have
be
infallibly
rifle
.
    
<EOS>
this
campaign
,
however
,
be
the
most
disagreeable
period
of
his
whole
life
;
because
the
manner
in
which
he
have
enter
into
the
service
,
subject
him
to
the
particular
observation
and
notice
of
the
french
officer
;
so
that
he
be
oblige
to
be
very
alert
in
his
duty
,
and
summon
all
his
fortitude
to
maintain
the
character
he
have
assume
.
 
<EOS>
what
render
his
situation
still
more
unpalateable
,
be
the
activity
of
both
army
in
the
course
of
this
season
,
during
which
,
over
and
above
sundry
fatiguing
marche
and
counter
-
marche
,
he
be
personally
engage
in
the
affair
of
Hallch
,
which
be
very
obstinate
,
where
be
in
the
skirt
of
the
detachment
,
he
be
actually
wound
in
the
face
by
the
sword
of
an
hussar
;
but
this
be
,
luckily
for
him
,
the
last
time
he
find
himself
under
the
necessity
of
exert
his
military
prowess
;
for
a
cessation
of
arm
be
proclaim
,
before
he
be
cure
of
his
wound
,
and
peace
conclude
about
the
end
of
the
campaign
.
    
<EOS>
during
his
sojourn
in
the
French
Camp
,
he
assume
the
character
of
a
man
of
family
,
who
be
disgust
at
some
supercilious
treatment
he
have
meet
with
in
the
german
service
,
and
at
the
same
time
ambitious
of
carry
arm
under
the
banner
of
France
,
take
the
opportunity
of
retreat
by
stealth
from
his
friend
,
accompany
only
by
one
with
whom
he
could
intrust
his
intention
.
    
<EOS>
in
this
capacity
,
he
have
manage
his
matter
to
such
advantage
,
that
many
french
officer
of
rank
be
very
well
disposed
to
contribute
their
interest
in
his
behalf
,
have
his
inclination
verge
towards
promotion
in
the
army
;
but
he
think
proper
to
conceal
his
real
design
,
under
the
specious
pretext
of
longing
to
see
the
metropolis
of
France
,
that
centre
of
pleasure
and
politeness
,
in
which
he
propose
to
spend
some
time
for
the
improvement
of
his
address
and
understanding
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
motive
too
laudable
to
be
oppose
by
his
new
patron
,
some
of
whom
furnish
him
with
letter
of
recommendation
to
certain
nobleman
of
the
first
rank
at
the
court
of
Versailles
,
for
which
place
<EOS>
he
and
his
companion
set
out
from
the
bank
of
the
Rhine
,
very
well
satisfied
with
the
honourable
dismission
they
have
obtain
from
a
life
of
inconvenience
,
danger
and
alarm
.
     
<EOS>
He
prepare
a
stratagem
,
but
find
himself
countermine
;
proceed
on
his
journey
,
and
be
overtake
by
a
terrible
tempest
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
this
journey
,
Ferdinand
,
who
be
never
deficient
in
his
political
capacity
,
hold
a
secret
conclave
with
his
own
thought
,
not
only
touch
the
plan
of
his
own
future
conduct
,
but
also
concern
his
associate
,
of
whose
fidelity
and
adherence
<EOS>
he
begin
to
entertain
such
doubt
as
discourage
him
from
the
prosecution
of
that
design
,
in
which
the
Tyroleze
have
be
at
first
include
:
for
he
have
lately
observe
him
practise
the
art
of
his
occupation
among
the
french
officer
,
with
such
rapacity
and
want
of
caution
,
as
indicate
a
dangerous
temerity
of
temper
,
as
well
as
a
furious
rage
of
acquire
,
which
may
be
sometime
or
other
satiate
upon
his
own
friend
.
 
<EOS>
in
other
word
,
our
adventurer
be
afraid
that
his
accomplice
would
profit
by
his
knowledge
of
the
road
and
country
thro
'
which
they
travel
,
and
after
have
make
free
with
his
most
valuable
effect
,
in
consequence
of
the
familiarity
subsist
between
them
,
leave
him
some
morning
without
the
ceremony
of
a
formal
adieu
.
    
<EOS>
arrouse
by
this
suspicion
,
he
resolve
to
anticipate
the
supposed
intention
of
the
Tyroleze
,
by
take
his
own
departure
in
the
same
abrupt
manner
;
and
this
scheme
he
actually
put
in
execution
,
upon
their
arrival
in
Bar
le
duc
,
where
it
be
agree
they
should
spend
a
day
to
repose
and
refresh
themselves
from
the
fatigue
of
hard
riding
.
 
<EOS>
Ferdinand
,
therefore
,
take
the
advantage
of
his
companion
's
absence
,
for
the
Tyroleze
have
walk
abroad
to
view
the
town
,
find
mean
to
hire
a
peasant
,
who
undertake
to
conduct
him
through
a
bye
road
,
as
far
as
chalon
;
and
with
this
guide
,
he
accordingly
set
out
on
horseback
,
after
have
discharge
the
bill
,
leave
a
blank
paper
seal
up
in
form
of
a
letter
,
direct
to
his
friend
,
and
secure
behind
his
own
saddle
,
a
pair
of
leathern
bag
in
which
his
jewel
and
cash
be
usually
contain
.
    
<EOS>
so
eager
be
our
hero
to
leave
the
Tyroleze
at
a
considerable
distance
behind
,
that
he
ride
all
night
at
a
round
pace
,
without
halt
,
and
next
morning
,
find
himself
at
a
village
distant
thirteen
good
league
,
from
any
part
of
the
route
,
which
he
and
his
companion
have
at
first
resolve
to
pursue
.
    
<EOS>
here
think
himself
safely
deliver
from
the
cause
of
all
his
apprehension
,
he
determine
to
lie
incognito
for
a
few
day
,
so
as
that
he
may
run
no
risque
of
an
accidental
meeting
upon
the
road
,
with
the
person
whose
company
he
have
forsake
;
and
accordingly
he
take
possession
of
an
apartment
,
in
which
he
go
to
rest
,
desire
his
guide
to
wake
him
,
when
dinner
should
be
ready
.
 
<EOS>
have
enjoy
a
very
comfortable
refreshment
of
sleep
,
with
his
bag
under
his
pillow
,
he
be
summon
accord
to
his
direction
,
and
eat
a
very
hearty
meal
with
great
tranquility
and
internal
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
,
he
amuse
himself
with
happy
presage
,
and
ideal
prospect
of
his
future
fortune
,
and
in
the
midst
of
these
imaginary
banquet
,
be
seize
with
an
inclination
of
realize
his
bliss
,
and
regale
his
eye
-
sight
with
the
fruit
of
that
success
,
which
have
hitherto
attend
his
endeavour
.
 
<EOS>
thus
inflame
,
he
open
the
repository
,
and
,
o
reader
!
<EOS>
what
be
his
reflection
,
when
in
lieu
of
mademoiselle
Melvile
's
ear
-
ring
and
necklace
,
the
German
's
golden
chain
,
diver
jewel
of
considerable
value
,
the
spoil
of
sundry
dupe
,
and
about
two
hundred
ducat
in
ready
money
,
he
find
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
parcel
of
rusty
nail
,
dispose
in
such
a
manner
as
to
resemble
in
weight
and
bulk
the
moveable
he
have
lose
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
suppose
,
our
adventurer
make
this
discovery
without
emotion
.
    
<EOS>
if
the
eternal
salvation
of
mankind
could
have
be
purchase
for
the
tenth
part
of
his
treasure
,
he
would
have
leave
the
whole
specie
in
a
state
of
reprobation
,
rather
than
redeem
them
at
that
price
,
unless
he
have
see
in
the
bargain
,
some
evident
advantage
to
his
own
concern
:
one
may
therefore
easily
conceive
with
what
milkiness
of
resignation
,
he
bear
the
loss
of
the
whole
,
and
see
himself
reduce
from
such
affluence
,
to
the
necessity
of
depend
upon
about
twenty
ducat
,
and
some
loose
silver
,
which
he
carry
in
his
pocket
,
for
his
expence
upon
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
however
bitter
this
pill
may
be
in
swallow
,
he
so
far
master
his
mortification
,
as
to
digest
it
with
a
good
grace
:
his
own
penetration
at
once
point
out
the
canal
through
which
this
misfortune
have
flow
upon
him
;
he
forthwith
place
the
calamity
to
the
account
of
the
Tyroleze
,
and
never
doubt
that
he
have
retire
with
the
booty
across
the
Rhine
,
into
some
place
to
which
he
know
Fathom
would
not
follow
his
footstep
,
he
form
the
melancholy
resolution
of
pursue
with
all
dispatch
his
journey
to
Paris
,
that
he
may
with
all
convenient
expedition
,
indemnify
himself
for
the
discomfiture
he
have
sustain
.
    
<EOS>
with
regard
to
his
confederate
,
his
conjecture
be
perfectly
right
;
that
adventurer
,
though
infinitely
inferior
to
our
hero
in
point
of
genius
and
invention
,
have
manifestly
the
advantage
of
him
,
in
the
article
of
age
and
experience
;
he
be
no
stranger
to
Fathom
's
qualification
,
the
happy
exertion
of
which
he
have
often
see
.
    
<EOS>
He
know
him
to
be
an
oeconomist
of
the
most
frugal
order
,
consequently
conclude
his
finance
be
worthy
of
examination
;
and
upon
the
true
principle
of
a
sharp
,
ease
him
of
the
incumbrance
,
take
it
for
grant
,
that
,
in
so
do
,
he
only
preclude
Ferdinand
from
the
power
of
act
the
same
tragedy
upon
him
,
should
ever
opportunity
concur
with
his
inclination
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
therefore
concert
his
measure
with
the
dexterity
of
an
experienced
conveyancer
,
and
snatch
the
occasion
,
while
our
hero
,
travel
-
taint
,
lie
sink
in
the
arm
of
profound
repose
,
he
ript
up
the
seam
of
the
leathern
depository
,
withdraw
the
content
,
introduce
the
parcel
of
nail
,
which
he
have
make
up
for
the
purpose
,
and
then
repair
the
breach
with
great
deliberation
.
    
<EOS>
have
Fathom
's
good
genius
prompt
him
to
examine
his
effect
next
morning
,
the
Tyroleze
,
in
all
probability
,
would
have
maintain
his
acquisition
by
force
of
arm
;
for
his
personal
courage
be
rather
more
determined
than
that
of
our
adventurer
,
and
he
be
conscious
of
his
own
ascendancy
in
this
particular
;
but
his
good
fortune
prevent
such
explanation
.
 
<EOS>
immediately
after
dinner
,
he
avail
himself
of
his
knowledge
,
and
betake
himself
to
a
remote
part
of
the
town
,
set
out
in
a
post
-
chaise
for
Luneville
,
while
our
hero
be
meditate
his
own
escape
.
    
<EOS>
Fathom
's
conception
be
sufficient
to
comprehend
the
whole
of
this
adventure
,
as
soon
as
his
chagrin
would
give
his
sagacity
fair
play
;
nor
would
he
allow
his
resolution
to
sink
under
the
trial
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
depart
from
the
village
,
that
same
afternoon
,
under
the
auspex
of
his
conductor
,
and
find
himself
benight
in
the
midst
of
a
forest
far
from
the
habitation
of
man
;
the
darkness
of
the
night
,
the
silence
and
solitude
of
the
place
,
the
indistinct
image
of
the
tree
that
appear
on
every
side
,
"
stretch
their
extravagant
arm
athwart
the
gloom
,
"
conspire
with
the
dejection
of
spirit
occasion
by
his
loss
to
disturb
his
fancy
,
and
raise
strange
phantom
in
his
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
although
he
be
not
naturally
superstitious
,
his
mind
begin
to
be
invade
with
an
awful
horror
,
that
gradually
prevail
over
all
the
consolation
of
reason
and
philosophy
;
nor
be
his
heart
free
from
the
terror
of
assassination
.
 
<EOS>
in
order
to
dissipate
these
disagreeable
reverie
,
he
have
recourse
to
the
conversation
of
his
guide
,
by
whom
he
be
entertain
with
the
history
of
diver
traveller
,
who
have
be
rob
and
murder
by
ruffian
,
whose
retreat
be
in
the
recess
of
that
very
wood
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
this
communication
,
which
do
not
at
all
tend
to
the
elevation
of
our
hero
's
spirit
,
the
conductor
make
an
excuse
for
drop
behind
,
while
our
traveller
jog
on
in
expectation
of
be
join
again
by
him
in
a
few
minute
:
he
be
however
disappoint
in
that
hope
:
<EOS>
the
sound
of
the
other
horse
's
foot
,
by
degree
,
grow
more
and
more
faint
,
and
at
last
altogether
die
away
.
    
<EOS>
Alarmed
at
this
circumstance
,
Fathom
halt
in
the
middle
of
the
road
,
and
listen
with
the
most
fearful
attention
;
but
his
sense
of
hearing
be
salute
with
nought
but
the
dismal
sighing
of
the
tree
,
<EOS>
that
seem
to
foretell
an
approach
storm
;
accordingly
the
Heavens
contract
a
more
dreary
aspect
,
the
lightning
begin
to
gleam
,
the
thunder
to
roll
,
and
the
temp
raise
its
voice
to
a
tremenduous
roar
,
descend
in
a
torrent
of
rain
.
    
<EOS>
in
this
emergency
,
the
fortitude
of
our
hero
be
almost
quite
overcome
;
so
many
concur
circumstance
of
danger
and
distress
may
have
appal
the
most
undaunted
breast
;
what
impression
then
must
they
have
make
upon
the
mind
of
Ferdinand
,
who
be
by
no
mean
a
man
to
set
fear
at
defiance
!
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
have
<EOS>
well
nigh
lose
the
use
of
his
reflection
,
and
be
actually
invade
to
the
skin
,
before
he
could
recollect
himself
so
far
as
to
quit
the
road
,
and
seek
for
shelter
among
the
thicket
that
surround
them
.
 
<EOS>
have
ride
some
furlong
into
the
forest
,
he
take
his
station
under
a
tuft
of
tall
tree
,
that
screen
him
from
the
storm
,
and
in
that
situation
call
a
council
within
himself
,
to
deliberate
upon
his
next
excursion
.
 
<EOS>
He
persuade
himself
,
that
his
guide
have
desert
him
for
the
present
,
in
order
to
give
intelligence
of
a
traveller
,
to
some
gang
of
robber
with
whom
he
be
connect
;
and
that
he
must
of
necessity
fall
a
prey
to
those
bandit
,
unless
he
should
have
the
good
fortune
to
elude
their
search
,
and
disentangle
himself
from
the
maze
of
the
wood
.
    
<EOS>
harrow
with
these
apprehension
,
he
resolve
to
commit
himself
to
the
mercy
of
the
hurricane
,
as
of
two
evil
the
least
,
and
penetrate
streight
forwards
through
some
devious
opening
,
until
he
should
be
deliver
from
the
forest
.
    
<EOS>
for
this
purpose
,
he
turn
his
horse
's
head
in
a
line
,
quite
contrary
to
the
direction
of
the
high
road
which
he
have
leave
,
on
the
supposition
,
that
the
robber
would
pursue
that
tract
in
quest
of
him
,
and
that
they
would
never
dream
of
his
desert
the
highway
,
to
traverse
an
unknown
forest
,
amidst
the
darkness
of
such
a
boisterous
night
.
 
<EOS>
after
he
have
continue
in
this
progress
,
through
a
succession
of
grove
,
and
bog
,
and
thorn
,
and
brake
,
by
which
,
not
only
his
cloath
,
but
also
his
skin
suffer
in
a
grievous
manner
,
while
every
nerve
quiver
with
eagerness
of
dismay
;
he
at
length
reach
an
open
plain
,
and
pursue
his
course
,
in
full
hope
of
arrive
at
some
village
,
where
his
life
would
be
safe
,
he
descry
a
rush
light
at
a
distance
,
which
he
look
upon
as
the
star
of
his
good
fortune
,
and
ride
towards
it
at
full
speed
,
arrive
at
the
door
of
a
lone
cottage
,
into
which
he
be
admit
by
an
old
woman
,
who
understand
he
be
a
bewildered
traveller
,
receive
him
with
great
hospitality
.
    
<EOS>
when
he
learn
from
his
hostess
,
that
there
be
not
another
house
within
three
league
,
that
she
could
accommodate
him
with
a
tolerable
bed
,
and
his
horse
with
lodging
and
oats
,
he
thank
Heaven
for
his
good
fortune
in
stumble
upon
this
homely
habitation
,
and
determine
to
pass
the
night
under
the
protection
of
the
old
cottager
,
who
give
him
to
understand
,
that
her
husband
,
who
be
a
faggot
-
maker
,
have
go
to
the
next
town
to
dispose
of
his
merchandize
,
and
that
,
in
all
probability
,
he
would
not
return
till
next
morning
,
on
account
of
the
tempestuous
night
.
    
<EOS>
Ferdinand
sound
the
bel
-
dame
with
a
thousand
artful
interrogation
,
and
she
answer
with
such
appearance
of
truth
and
simplicity
,
that
he
conclude
his
person
be
quite
secure
;
and
after
have
be
regale
with
a
dish
of
egg
and
bacon
,
desire
she
would
conduct
him
into
the
chamber
where
she
propose
he
should
take
his
repose
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
accordingly
usher
up
by
a
sort
of
ladder
,
into
an
apartment
furnish
with
a
standing
-
bed
,
and
almost
half
fill
with
truss
of
straw
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
extremely
well
pleased
with
his
lodging
,
which
in
reality
exceed
his
expectation
,
and
his
kind
landlady
caution
him
against
let
the
candle
approach
the
combustible
,
take
her
leave
,
and
lock
the
door
on
the
outside
.
     
<EOS>
He
fall
upon
Scylla
,
seek
to
avoid
Charybdis
.
   
<EOS>
Fathom
,
whose
own
principle
teach
him
to
be
suspicious
,
and
ever
upon
his
guard
against
the
treachery
of
his
fellow
-
creature
,
could
have
dispense
with
this
instance
of
her
care
in
confine
her
guest
to
her
chamber
,
and
begin
to
be
seize
with
strange
fancy
,
when
he
observe
that
there
be
no
bolt
on
the
inside
of
the
door
,
by
which
he
may
secure
himself
from
intrusion
.
 
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
these
suggestion
,
he
propose
to
take
an
accurate
survey
of
every
object
in
the
apartment
;
and
in
the
course
of
his
inquiry
,
have
the
mortification
to
find
the
dead
body
of
a
man
,
still
warm
,
who
have
be
lately
stab
,
and
conceal
beneath
several
bundle
of
straw
.
    
<EOS>
such
a
discovery
could
not
fail
to
fill
the
breast
of
our
hero
,
with
unspeakable
horror
;
for
he
conclude
,
that
he
himself
would
undergo
the
same
fate
before
morning
,
without
the
interposition
of
a
miracle
in
his
favour
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
first
transport
of
his
dread
,
he
run
to
the
window
with
a
view
to
escape
by
that
outlet
,
and
find
his
flight
effectually
obstruct
by
diver
strong
bar
of
iron
.
 
<EOS>
then
his
heart
begin
to
palpitate
,
his
hair
to
bristle
up
,
and
his
knee
to
totter
;
his
thought
teem
with
presage
of
death
and
destruction
;
his
conscience
rise
up
in
judgment
against
him
,
and
he
undergo
a
severe
paroxysm
of
dismay
and
distraction
.
 
<EOS>
His
spirit
be
agitate
into
a
state
of
fermentation
that
produce
a
species
of
resolution
a
-
kin
to
that
which
be
inspire
by
brandy
or
other
strong
liquor
,
and
by
an
impulse
that
seem
supernatural
,
he
be
immediately
hurry
into
measure
for
his
own
preservation
.
    
<EOS>
what
upon
a
less
interesting
occasion
his
imagination
durst
not
propose
,
he
now
execute
without
scruple
or
remorse
:
he
undress
the
corpse
that
lie
bleed
among
the
straw
,
and
convey
it
to
the
bed
in
his
arm
,
deposit
it
in
the
attitude
of
a
person
who
sleep
at
his
ease
;
then
he
extinguish
the
light
,
take
possession
of
the
place
from
whence
the
body
have
be
remove
,
and
hold
a
pistol
ready
cock
in
each
hand
,
wait
for
the
sequel
with
that
determine
purpose
,
which
be
often
the
immediate
production
of
despair
.
    
<EOS>
about
midnight
he
hear
the
sound
of
foot
ascend
the
ladder
,
the
door
be
softly
open
,
he
see
the
shadow
of
two
man
stalk
towards
the
bed
,
a
dark
lanthorn
be
unshroude
,
direct
their
aim
to
the
suppose
sleeper
,
and
he
that
hold
it
,
thrust
a
poignard
to
his
heart
;
the
force
of
the
blow
make
a
compression
on
the
chest
,
and
a
sort
of
groan
issue
from
the
windpipe
of
the
defunct
;
the
stroke
be
repeat
,
without
produce
a
repetition
of
the
note
,
so
that
the
assassin
conclude
the
work
be
effectually
do
,
and
retire
for
the
present
,
with
a
design
to
return
and
rifle
the
deceased
at
their
leisure
.
    
<EOS>
never
have
our
hero
spend
a
moment
in
such
agony
,
as
he
feel
during
this
operation
;
the
whole
surface
of
his
body
be
cover
with
a
cold
sweat
,
and
his
nerve
be
relaxed
with
an
universal
palsy
:
in
short
,
he
remain
in
a
trance
that
,
in
all
probability
,
contribute
to
his
safety
;
for
have
he
retain
the
use
of
his
sense
,
he
may
have
be
discover
by
the
transport
of
his
fear
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
use
he
make
of
his
retrieve
recollection
,
be
to
perceive
that
the
assassin
have
leave
the
door
open
in
their
retreat
;
and
he
would
have
instantly
avail
himself
of
this
their
neglect
,
by
sallye
out
upon
them
,
at
the
hazard
of
his
life
,
have
not
he
be
restrain
by
a
conversation
he
overhear
in
the
room
below
,
import
that
the
ruffian
be
go
to
set
out
upon
another
expedition
,
in
hope
of
find
more
prey
<EOS>
:
they
accordingly
depart
,
after
have
lay
strong
injunction
upon
the
old
woman
,
to
keep
the
door
fast
lock
during
their
absence
;
and
Ferdinand
take
his
resolution
without
farth
delay
.
    
<EOS>
so
soon
as
,
by
his
conjecture
,
the
robber
be
at
a
sufficient
distance
from
the
house
,
he
rise
from
his
lurking
-
place
,
move
softly
towards
the
bed
,
and
rumage
the
pocket
of
the
deceased
,
find
a
purse
well
store
with
ducat
,
of
which
,
together
with
a
silver
watch
and
a
diamond
ring
,
he
immediately
possess
himself
without
scruple
;
then
descend
with
great
care
and
circumspection
,
into
the
low
apartment
,
stand
before
the
old
beldam
,
before
she
have
the
least
intima-
of
his
approach
.
    
<EOS>
Accustomed
as
she
be
to
the
trade
of
blood
,
the
hoary
hag
do
not
behold
this
apparition
without
give
sign
of
infinite
terror
and
astonishment
,
believe
it
be
no
other
than
the
spirit
of
her
second
guest
who
have
be
murder
;
she
fall
upon
her
knee
,
and
begin
to
recommend
herfelf
to
the
protection
of
the
saint
,
cross
herself
with
as
much
devotion
,
as
if
she
have
be
entitle
to
the
particular
care
and
attention
of
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
nor
do
her
anxiety
abate
,
when
she
be
undeceived
in
this
her
supposition
,
and
understand
it
be
no
phantom
,
but
the
real
substance
of
the
stranger
,
who
,
without
stay
to
upbraid
her
with
the
enormity
of
her
crime
,
command
her
,
on
pain
of
immediate
death
,
to
produce
his
horse
,
to
which
be
conduct
,
he
set
her
upon
the
saddle
without
delay
,
and
mount
behind
,
invest
her
with
the
management
of
the
rein
,
swear
,
in
a
most
peremptory
tone
,
that
the
only
chance
she
have
for
her
life
,
be
in
direct
him
safely
to
the
next
town
;
and
that
so
soon
as
she
should
give
him
the
least
cause
to
doubt
her
fidelity
in
the
performance
of
that
task
,
he
would
,
on
the
instant
,
act
the
part
of
her
executioner
.
    
<EOS>
this
declaration
have
its
effect
upon
the
withered
Hecate
,
who
,
with
many
supplication
for
mercy
and
forgiveness
,
promise
to
guide
him
in
safety
,
to
a
certain
village
at
the
distance
of
two
league
,
where
he
may
lodge
in
security
,
and
be
provide
with
a
fresh
horse
or
other
convenience
,
for
pursue
his
intend
route
.
 
<EOS>
on
these
condition
,
he
tell
her
,
she
may
deserve
his
clemency
,
and
they
accordingly
take
their
departure
together
,
she
be
place
astride
upon
the
saddle
,
hold
the
bridle
in
one
hand
,
and
a
switch
in
the
other
;
and
our
adventurer
sit
on
the
crupper
,
superintend
her
conduct
,
and
keep
the
muzzle
of
a
pistol
close
at
her
ear
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
equipage
,
they
travel
across
part
of
the
same
wood
,
in
which
his
guide
have
forsake
him
;
and
it
be
not
to
be
suppose
,
that
he
pass
his
time
in
the
most
agreeable
reverie
,
while
he
find
himself
involve
in
the
labyrinth
of
those
shade
,
which
he
consider
as
the
haunt
of
robbery
and
assassination
.
    
<EOS>
common
fear
be
a
comfortable
sensation
to
what
he
feel
in
this
excursion
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
step
he
have
take
for
his
preservation
,
be
the
effect
of
meer
instinct
,
while
his
faculty
be
extinguish
or
suppress
by
despair
;
but
,
now
as
his
reflection
begin
to
recur
,
he
be
haunt
by
the
most
intolerable
apprehension
.
 
<EOS>
every
whisper
of
the
wind
through
the
thicket
,
be
swell
into
the
hoarse
menace
of
murder
,
the
shaking
of
the
bough
be
construe
into
the
brandishing
of
poignard
,
and
every
shadow
of
a
tree
become
the
apparition
of
a
ruffian
eager
for
blood
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
at
each
of
these
occurrence
he
feel
what
be
infinitely
more
tormenting
than
the
stab
of
a
real
dagger
;
and
at
every
fresh
filip
of
his
fear
,
he
act
as
remembrancer
to
his
conductress
,
in
a
new
volley
of
imprecation
,
import
that
her
life
be
absolutely
connect
with
his
opinion
of
his
own
safety
.
    
<EOS>
human
nature
could
not
long
subsist
under
such
complicated
terror
:
at
last
he
find
himself
clear
of
the
forest
,
and
be
bless
with
the
distant
view
of
an
inhabited
place
:
he
then
begin
to
exercise
his
thought
upon
a
new
subject
.
 
<EOS>
He
debate
with
himself
,
whether
he
should
make
a
parade
of
his
intrepidity
and
public
spirit
,
by
disclose
his
atchievement
and
surrender
his
guide
to
the
penalty
of
the
law
;
or
leave
the
old
hag
and
her
accomplice
to
the
remorse
of
their
own
conscience
,
and
proceed
quietly
on
his
journey
to
Paris
,
in
undisturbed
possession
of
the
prize
he
have
already
obtain
.
 
<EOS>
this
last
step
he
determine
to
take
,
upon
recollecting
,
that
in
the
course
of
his
information
,
the
story
of
the
murder
stranger
would
infallibly
attract
the
attention
of
justice
,
and
in
that
case
the
effect
he
have
borrow
from
the
defunct
must
be
refund
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
have
a
right
to
the
succession
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
an
argument
which
our
adventurer
could
not
resist
<EOS>
;
he
foresee
that
he
should
be
stript
of
his
acquisition
,
which
he
look
upon
as
the
fair
fruit
of
his
valour
and
sagacity
;
and
moreover
,
be
detain
as
an
evidence
against
the
robber
,
to
the
manif
detriment
of
his
affair
:
perhaps
too
,
he
have
motive
of
conscience
that
dissuade
him
from
bear
witness
against
a
set
of
people
,
whose
principle
do
not
much
differ
from
his
own
.
    
<EOS>
influence
by
such
consideration
,
he
yield
to
the
first
importunity
of
the
beldam
,
whom
he
dismiss
at
a
very
small
distance
from
the
village
,
after
he
have
earnestly
exhort
her
to
quit
such
an
attrocious
course
of
life
,
and
attone
for
her
past
crime
,
by
sacrifice
her
associate
to
the
demand
of
justice
.
    
<EOS>
She
do
not
fail
to
vow
a
perfect
reformation
,
and
to
prostrate
herself
before
him
for
the
favour
she
have
find
,
then
she
betake
herself
to
her
habitation
,
with
full
purpose
of
advise
her
fellow
murderer
to
repair
with
all
dispatch
to
the
village

and
impeach
our
hero

who
wisely
distrust
her
profession
,
staid
no
longer
in
the
place
,
than
to
hire
a
guide
for
the
next
stage
,
which
bring
him
to
the
city
of
Chalons
sur
Marne
.
     
<EOS>
He
arrive
at
Paris
,
and
be
pleased
with
his
reception
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
not
so
smitten
with
the
delightful
situation
of
this
ancient
town
,
but
that
he
abandon
it
as
soon
as
he
could
procure
a
post
-
chaise
,
in
which
he
arrive
at
Paris
,
without
have
be
expose
to
any
other
troublesome
adventure
upon
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
lodging
at
a
certain
hotel
in
the
Foxbourg
de
St
Germain
,
which
be
the
general
rendezvous
of
all
the
stranger
that
resort
to
this
capital
;
and
now
sincerely
congratulate
himself
upon
his
happy
escape
from
his
hungarian
connection
,
and
from
the
snare
of
the
bandit
;
as
well
as
upon
the
spoil
of
the
dead
body
,
and
his
arrival
at
Paris
,
<EOS>
from
whence
there
be
such
a
short
conveyance
to
England
,
whither
he
be
attract
by
far
other
motive
than
that
of
filial
veneration
for
his
native
soil
.
    
<EOS>
He
suppress
all
his
letter
of
recommendation
,
which
he
justly
conclude
,
would
subject
him
to
a
tedious
course
of
attendance
upon
the
great
,
and
lie
him
under
the
necessity
of
solliciting
preferment
in
the
army
,
than
which
nothing
be
farth
from
his
inclination
;
and
resolve
to
make
his
appearance
in
the
character
of
a
private
gentleman
,
which
would
supply
him
with
opportunity
of
examine
the
different
scene
of
life
in
such
a
gay
metropolis
,
so
as
that
he
should
be
able
to
chuse
that
sphere
in
which
he
could
move
the
most
effectually
to
his
own
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
He
accordingly
hire
an
occasional
domestic
,
and
under
the
denomination
of
Count
Fadome
,
which
he
have
retain
since
his
elopement
from
Renaldo
,
repair
to
dinner
at
an
ordinary
,
to
which
he
be
direct
as
a
reputable
place
frequent
by
fashionable
stranger
of
all
nation
.
    
<EOS>
He
find
this
piece
of
information
perfectly
just
;
for
he
no
sooner
enter
the
apartment
,
than
his
ear
be
salute
with
a
strange
confusion
of
sound
,
among
which
he
at
once
distinguish
the
high
and
low
dutch
,
barbarous
french
,
italian
and
english
language
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
rejoice
at
this
occasion
of
display
his
own
qualification
;
take
his
place
at
one
of
three
long
table
,
betwixt
a
westphalian
count
,
and
a
Bolognian
-
marquis
,
insinuate
himself
into
the
conversation
with
his
usual
address
,
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
,
find
mean
to
accost
a
native
of
each
different
country
,
in
his
own
mother
tongue
.
    
<EOS>
such
extensive
knowledge
do
not
pass
unobserved
.
 
<EOS>
a
french
abb'e
,
in
a
provincial
dialect
,
compliment
him
upon
his
retain
that
purity
in
pronounciation
,
which
be
not
to
be
find
in
the
speech
of
a
Parisian
.
    
<EOS>
the
Bolognian
mistake
him
for
a
Tuscan
,
"
Sir
,
say
he
,
I
presume
you
be
from
Florence
<EOS>
:
 
<EOS>
I
hope
the
illustrious
house
of
Lorrain
leave
you
gentleman
of
that
famous
city
,
no
room
to
regret
the
loss
of
your
own
prince

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
castle
of
Versailles
become
the
subject
of
conversation
,
monsieur
le
Comte
appeal
to
him
as
to
a
native
German
,
whether
it
be
not
inferior
in
point
of
magnificence
to
the
Chateau
of
Grubenhagen
:
the
dutch
officer
address
himself
to
Fathom
,
drink
to
the
prosperity
of
Faderland
,
and
ask
if
he
have
not
once
serve
in
garrison
at
Schenkenschans
;
and
an
english
knight
swear
with
great
assurence
,
that
he
have
frequently
ramble
with
him
at
midnight
,
among
the
hundred
of
Drury
.
    
<EOS>
to
each
person
he
reply
in
a
polite
,
tho
'
mysterious
manner
,
which
do
not
fail
to
inhance
their
opinion
of
his
good
breeding
and
importance
;
and
long
before
the
desert
appear
,
he
be
by
all
the
company
suppose
to
be
a
personage
of
great
consequence
,
who
for
some
substantial
reason
,
find
it
convenient
to
keep
himself
incognito
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
case
,
it
be
not
to
be
doubt
that
particular
civility
be
pour
upon
him
from
all
quarter
:
he
perceive
their
sentiment
,
and
encourage
them
,
by
behave
with
that
sort
of
complaisance
,
which
seem
to
be
the
result
of
engage
condescension
in
a
character
of
superior
dignity
and
station
.
    
<EOS>
His
affability
be
general
;
but
his
chief
attention
limit
to
those
gentleman
already
mention
,
who
chance
to
sit
near
him
at
table
;
and
he
no
sooner
give
them
to
understand
that
he
be
an
utter
stranger
in
Paris
,
than
they
unanimously
beg
to
have
the
honour
of
make
him
acquaint
with
the
different
curiosity
peculiar
to
that
metropolis
.
    
<EOS>
He
accept
of
their
hospitality
,
accompany
them
to
a
coffee
-
house
in
the
afternoon
,
<EOS>
from
whence
they
repair
to
the
opera
,
and
afterwards
adjourn
to
a
note
hotel
,
in
order
to
spend
the
remain
part
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
here
that
our
hero
secure
himself
effectually
in
the
footing
he
have
gain
in
their
good
grace
:
<EOS>
he
in
a
moment
see
through
all
the
character
of
the
partie
,
and
adapt
himself
to
the
humour
of
each
individual
;
without
descend
from
that
elevation
of
behaviour
,
which
,
he
perceive
,
would
operate
among
them
in
his
behalf
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
italian
he
discourse
on
musick
,
in
the
stile
of
a
connoisseur
;
and
indeed
have
a
well
claim
to
that
title
than
the
generality
of
those
upon
whom
it
be
usually
confer
;
for
he
understand
the
art
in
theory
as
well
as
in
practice
,
and
would
have
make
no
contemptible
figure
among
the
good
performer
of
the
age
.
    
<EOS>
He
harangue
upon
taste
and
genius
,
to
the
abb'e
,
who
be
a
wit
and
critic
,
ex
officio
,
or
rather
ex
vestitu
:
for
,
a
young
pert
Frenchman
,
the
very
moment
he
put
on
the
petit
collet
,
or
little
band
,
look
upon
himself
as
an
inspired
son
of
Apollo
;
and
every
one
of
the
fraternity
think
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
assert
the
divinity
of
his
mission
:
in
a
word
,
the
abb'es
be
a
set
of
people
,
that
bear
a
strong
analogy
to
the
templar
in
London
.
    
<EOS>
Fools
of
each
fabric
,
sharper
of
all
sort
,
and
dunce
of
every
degree
<EOS>
,
profess
themselves
of
both
order
:
the
templar
be
,
generally
speak
,
a
prig
;
so
be
the
abb'e
:
both
be
distinguish
by
an
air
of
petulance
and
self
-
conceit
,
which
hold
a
middle
rank
betwixt
<EOS>
the
insolence
of
a
first
rate
buck
,
and
the
learned
pride
of
a
supercilious
pedant
.
 
<EOS>
the
abb'e
be
suppose
to
be
a
young
brother
in
quest
of
preferment
in
the
church
:
the
temple
be
consider
as
a
receptacle
or
seminary
for
young
son
,
intend
for
the
bar
;
but
a
great
number
of
each
profession
turn
aside
into
other
path
of
life
,
long
before
they
reach
these
propose
goal
:
an
abb'e
be
often
metamorphose
into
a
foot
soldier
;
a
templar
sometimes
sink
into
an
attorney
's
clerk
:
the
gallie
of
France
abound
with
abb'es
;
and
many
templar
may
be
find
in
our
american
plantation
;
not
to
mention
those
who
have
make
a
public
exit
nearer
home
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
I
would
not
have
it
think
,
that
my
description
include
every
individual
of
those
society
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
the
great
scholar
,
politician
,
and
wit
that
ever
Europe
produce
,
have
wear
the
habit
of
an
abb'e
and
many
of
our
most
noble
family
in
England
derive
their
honour
from
those
who
have
study
law
in
the
temple
;
the
worthy
son
of
every
community
shall
always
be
sacred
from
my
censure
and
ridicule
;
and
while
I
laugh
at
the
folly
of
particular
member
,
I
can
still
honour
and
revere
the
institution
.
    
<EOS>
but
,
let
us
return
from
this
comparison
,
which
some
reader
may
think
impertinent
and
unseasonable
;
and
observe
,
that
the
westphalian
count
,
dutch
officer
,
and
English
knight
,
be
not
except
from
the
particular
regard
and
attention
of
our
adventurer
:
<EOS>
he
pledge
the
German
in
every
bumper
;
flatter
the
Hollander
with
compliment
upon
the
industry
,
wealth
and
policy
of
the
Seven
United
Provinces
;
but
he
reserve
his
chief
battery
for
his
own
countryman
,
on
the
supposition
that
he
be
,
in
all
respect
,
the
best
adapt
for
the
purpose
of
a
needy
gamester
:
 
<EOS>
Him
,
therefore
,
he
cultivate
with
extraordinary
care
,
and
singular
observance
;
for
he
soon
perceive
him
to
be
an
humourist
,
and
from
that
circumstance
derive
an
happy
presage
of
his
own
success
.
 
<EOS>
the
baronet
's
disposition
seem
to
be
cast
in
the
true
English
mould
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
sour
,
silent
and
contemptuous
;
his
very
look
indicate
a
consciousness
of
superior
wealth
,
and
he
never
open
his
mouth
,
except
to
make
some
dry
,
sarcastic
,
national
reflection
:
nor
be
his
behaviour
free
from
that
air
of
suspicion
which
a
man
put
on
,
when
he
believe
himself
in
a
croud
of
pick
-
pocket
whom
his
caution
and
vigilance
set
at
defiance
:
in
a
word
,
though
his
tongue
be
silent
on
the
subject
,
his
whole
demeanour
be
continually
say
,
"
You
be
all
a
pack
of
poor
lousy
rascal
,
who
have
a
design
upon
my
purse
:
'
tis
true
,
I
could
buy
your
whole
generation
;
but
,
I
will
not
be
bubble
,
d'ye
see
;
I
be
aware
of
your
flattery
,
and
upon
my
guard
against
all
your
knavish
prank
;
and
I
come
into
your
company
,
for
my
own
amusement
only
.
"
    
<EOS>
Fathom
have
reconnoitre
this
peculiarity
of
temper
,
instead
of
treat
him
with
that
assiduous
complaisance
,
which
he
receive
from
the
other
gentleman
of
the
party
,
keep
aloof
from
him
in
the
conversation
,
with
a
remarkable
shyness
of
distant
civility
,
and
seldom
take
notice
of
what
he
say
,
except
with
a
view
to
contradict
him
,
or
retort
some
of
his
satyrical
observation
.
 
<EOS>
this
he
conceive
to
be
the
good
method
of
acquire
his
good
opinion
;
because
the
Englishman
would
naturally
conclude
,
he
be
a
person
who
could
have
no
sinister
view
upon
this
fortune
,
else
he
would
have
choose
quite
a
different
manner
of
deportment
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
the
knight
seem
to
bite
at
the
hook
:
he
listen
to
Ferdinand
with
uncommon
regard
;
he
be
even
hear
to
commend
his
remark
;
and
at
length
drink
to
their
well
acquaintance
.
     
<EOS>
acquit
himself
with
address
in
a
nocturnal
riot
.
   
<EOS>
the
Italian
and
the
Abb'e
be
the
first
who
begin
to
grow
whimsical
under
the
influence
of
the
Burgundy
;
and
in
the
heat
of
their
elevation
,
propose
that
the
company
should
amuse
themselves
during
the
remain
part
of
the
night
,
at
the
house
of
an
obliging
dame
,
who
maintain
a
troop
of
fair
nymph
,
for
the
accommodation
of
the
other
sex
.
    
<EOS>
the
proposal
be
approve
by
all
,
except
the
Hollander
,
whose
oeconomy
the
wine
have
not
as
yet
invade
;
and
while
he
retreat
soberly
to
his
own
lodging
,
the
rest
of
the
society
adjourn
in
two
coach
,
to
the
temple
of
love
,
where
they
be
receive
by
the
venerable
priestess
,
a
personage
turn
of
seventy
,
who
seem
to
exercise
the
function
of
her
calling
,
in
despight
of
the
most
cruel
ravage
of
time
:
for
age
have
bend
her
into
the
form
of
a
turkish
bow
:
her
head
be
agitate
by
the
palsy
,
like
the
leaf
of
the
poplar
tree
,
her
her
hair
fall
down
in
scanty
parcel
,
as
white
as
the
drive
snow
:
<EOS>
her
face
be
not
simply
wrinkle
,
but
plow
into
innumerable
furrow
:
her
jaws
could
not
boast
of
one
remain
tooth
;
one
eye
distil
a
large
quantity
of
rheum
,
by
virtue
of
the
fiery
edge
that
surround
it
,
the
other
be
altogether
extinguish
,
and
she
have
lose
her
nose
in
the
course
of
her
ministration
.
 
<EOS>
the
delphic
sibyl
be
but
a
type
of
this
hoary
matron
,
who
by
her
figure
may
have
be
mistake
for
the
consort
of
chaos
,
or
mother
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
yet
there
be
something
meritorious
in
her
appearance
,
as
it
denote
her
an
indefatigable
minister
to
the
pleasure
of
mankind
;
and
as
it
form
an
agreeable
contrast
with
the
beauty
and
youth
of
the
fair
damsel
that
wanton
in
her
train
.
 
<EOS>
It
resemble
those
discord
in
music
,
which
,
properly
disposed
,
contribute
to
the
harmony
of
the
whole
piece
:
or
those
horrible
giant
,
who
in
the
world
of
romance
,
use
to
guard
the
gate
of
the
castle
,
in
which
the
inchanted
damsel
be
confine
.
    
<EOS>
this
Urganda
seem
to
be
aware
of
her
own
importance
,
and
perfectly
well
acquaint
with
the
human
appetite
;
for
she
compel
the
whole
company
to
undergo
her
embrace
;
then
a
lacquey
in
magnificent
livery
usher
them
into
a
superb
apartment
,
where
they
wait
some
minute
,
without
be
favour
with
the
appearance
of
the
lady
,
to
the
manif
dissatisfaction
of
the
abb'e
,
who
send
for
the
gouvernante
,
reprimand
her
severely
for
her
want
of
politesse
.
    
<EOS>
the
old
lady
,
who
be
by
no
mean
a
pattern
of
patience
and
submission
,
retort
his
reproach
with
great
emphasis
and
vivacity
:
her
eloquence
flow
altogether
in
the
Covent
garden
strain
;
and
I
question
,
whether
the
celebrated
mother
d####gl####
herself
could
have
make
such
a
figure
in
extemporaneous
altercation
.
    
<EOS>
after
have
bestow
upon
the
abb'e
the
epithet
of
saucy
insignificant
pimp
,
she
put
him
in
mind
of
the
good
office
which
he
have
receive
at
her
hand
;
how
she
have
supply
him
with
bed
,
board
,
and
bed
fellow
,
in
his
great
necessity
;
send
him
abroad
with
money
in
his
pocket
,
and
in
a
word
,
cherish
him
in
her
bosom
,
when
his
own
mother
have
abandon
him
to
distress
:
she
then
revile
him
for
presume
to
affront
her
before
stranger
,
and
give
the
company
to
understand
that
the
young
lady
would
wait
upon
them
,
as
soon
as
they
could
be
confess
and
receive
absolution
from
a
worthy
cordelier
,
who
be
now
employ
in
perform
that
charitable
office
.
 
<EOS>
the
gentleman
be
satisfied
with
this
remonstrance
,
which
argue
the
old
lady
's
pious
concern
for
the
soul
that
be
under
her
care
,
and
our
adventurer
propose
an
accommodation
betwixt
her
and

this

gay
dishabille

our

compliment
with
the
privilege
of
chuse
his
Amanda
from
the
whole
bevy

when

provide

the

to

themselves
,
and
unhappily
the
german
count
chance
to
pitch
upon
the
same
nymph
who
have
captivate
the
desire
of
the
british
knight
:
a
dispute

for
the

make
his

without

the

regard
to

be
pleased

his
attachment

do
not
scruple
to
renounce
his
rival
,
who
swear
by
the
thunder
,
lightning
and
sacrament
,
that
he
would
not
quit
his
pretension
for
any
prince
in
Christendom
,
much
less
for
a
little
english
chevalier
,
whom
he
have
already
honour
too
much
in
condescending
to
be
his
companion
.
    
<EOS>
the
knight
,
provoke
at
this
stately
declaration
,
which
be
the
immediate
effect
of
anger
and
ebriety
,
eye
his
antagonist
with
a
most
contemptuous
aspect
,
and
advise
him
to
avoid
such
comparison
for
the
future
:
<EOS>
"
We
all
know
,
say
he
,
the
importance
of
a
german
count
;
I
suppose
your
revenue
amount
to
three
hundred
rixdollar
;
and
you
have
a
chateau
that
look
like
the
ruin
of
an
english
goal
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
bind
myself
to
lend
you
a
thousand
pound
upon
a
mortgage
of
your
estate
(
and
<EOS>
a
bad
bargain
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
should
have
:
)
if
I
do
not
in
less
than
two
month
,
find
a
yeoman
of
Kent
,
who
spend
more
in
strong
ale
,
than
the
sum
total
of
your
yearly
income
;
and
be
the
truth
know
<EOS>
,
I
believe
that
lace
upon
your
coat
,
be
no
well
than
tinsel
,
and
those
fringed
ruffle
with
fine
Holland
sleeve
,
tack
to
a
shirt
of
brown
canvas
,
so
that
be
you
to
undress
yourself
before
the
lady
,
you
would
only
expose
your
own
poverty
and
pride
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
count
be
so
much
enrage
at
these
sarcastic
observation
,
that
his
faculty
of
speech
be
overwhelm
by
his
resentment
;
though
in
order
to
acquit
himself
of
the
Englishman
's
imputation
,
he
forthwith
pull
off
his
cloath
with
such
fury
,
that
his
brocard
waist
coat
be
tear
from
top
to
bottom
.
 
<EOS>
the
knight
mistake
his
meaning
,
consider
this
demeanour
as
a
fair
challenge
,
to
try
which
be
the
well
man
in
the
exercise
of
boxing
;
and
on
that
supposition
,
begin
to
strip

his
turn

undeceived

Fathom

who
put
the
right
interpretation
upon

behaviour

by

recover
the
use

many
threat
and
imprecation

they
would
take
notice
how
falsly
he
have
be
asperse
,
and
do
him
justice
in
espouse
his
claim
to
the
damsel
in
question
    
before
the
company
have
time
or
inclination

themselves
in

his

that

German

ever
dream
of
force
the
inclination
of
a
pretty
girl
,
whom
the
accident
of
fortune
have
subject
to
his
power
:
that
such
compulsion
be
equivalent
to
the
most
cruel
rape
that
could
be
commit
;
and
that
the
lady
's
aversion
be
not
at
all
surprising
;
for
,
to
speak
his

sentiment
,
be
he
a
woman
of
pleasure
,
he
would
as
soon
grant
favour
to
a
westphalian
hog

as

the
German
enrage
at

discretion

he
call
the
knight
an
english
clown

and
swear
he
be
the
most
untoward
beast
of
a
whole
nation
of

,
snatch
up
one
of
the

which

with
such

that

wing
its

<EOS>
the

that

<EOS>
the

consult
their

count
Fathom

retire
to
one
corner
of
the
room
,
while
the

upon
him
the
terror
of

endeavour
to
appease

part
the
combatant

and
in

into

no

than
he
leap
in

that

with
a
cross

the

by

intreatie
of
Fathom
,
to
quit
the
field
of
battle

half
an
hour

from

defy
him
to
single
combat
on

who
be
flush
with
conquest

treat
his
adversary
with
great
contempt

but
,
next
day
,
when

fume
of
the
Burgundy
be
quite
exhale
,
and
the

recur
to
his
remembrance

sober
reflection
,
he
wait
upon

at
his

and
sollicite
his
advice
in
such
a
manner
,
as
give
him
to
understand
that
he
look
upon
what
have
happen
,
as
a
drunken
brawl
,
which

to
have
no
serious
consequence

<EOS>
Fathom
foresee
that
the
affair
may
be
manage
for
his
own
interest
,
profess
himself
of
the
baronet

opinion
;
and
without
hesitation
,
undertake
the
office
of
a
mediator
,
assure
his
principal
that
his
honour
should
suffer
no
stain
in
the
course
of
his
negotiation
.
    
<EOS>
have
receive
the
Englishman
's
acknowledgement
for
this
instance
of
friendship
,
he
forthwith
set
out
for
the
place
of
the
German

habitation
,
and
understanding
he
be
still
asleep

insist
upon

that
a

from
the

desire
to
see
him

upon
business
of
importance
which

not

accordingly

his
valet
de

,
press
by
Fathom
's
importunity
and
remonstrance
,
venture
to
go
in
and
shake
the
count
by
the
shoulder
;
when
this
furious
Teutonian
,
still
agitate
by
the
fever
of
the
preceede
night
,
leap
out
of
bed
in
a
frenzy
,
and
seize
his
sword

would
have
severely
punish

of
his

,
have
not
he
be
restrain
by
the
entrance
of
Ferdinand
who
,
with
,
a
preremptory
countenance
,
give
him
to
understand
that
the
valet
have
act
at
his
immediate
instigation
;
and
that
he
be
come
,
as
the
Englishman
's
friend
,
to
concert
with
him
proper
measure
for
keep
the
appointment
they
have
make
at
their
last
meeting
.
    
<EOS>
this
message
effectually
calm
the
German
;
who
be
not
a
little
mortify
to
find
himself
so
disagreeably
disturb
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
help
curse
the
impatience
of
his
antagonist
,
and
even
hint
that
he
would
have
act
more
like
a
gentleman
and
good
christian
,
in
express
a
desire
of
see
the
affair
accommodate
,
as
he
know
himself
to
be
the
aggressor
,
<EOS>
consequently
the
first
offender
against
the
law
of

good
fellowship

<EOS>
Fathom
find
him
in
a
fit
temper
of
mind
,
take
the
opportunity
of
assent
to
the
reasonableness
of
his
observation
:
he
venture
to
condemn
the
impetuosity
of
the
baronet
,
who
,
he
perceive
,
be
extremely
nice
and
scrupulous
in
the
punctilio
of
honour
;
and
say
it
be
pity
that
two
gentleman
should
forfeit
each
other
's
friendship
,
much
less
expose
their
life
for
such
a
frivolous
cause

Count
Fathom
,
with
a
view
to
chastise
the
Westphalian
for
this
rhodomontade

tell
him
with
a
mortifying
air
of
indifference

that
if

he
would
save

know
the
hour
at
which
it
would
suit
him
to
take
the
air
with
the
baronet

the

not

this
question

he

not
know
whether
or
not
they
ought
to
interpret
the
content
into
a
challenge

;
when
our
hero
observe
,
that
the
ambiguity
of
his
expression
plainly
prove
there
be
a
door
leave
open
for
accommodation
;
and
propose
that
they
should
forthwith
visit
the
writer
at
his
own
apartment
:
they
accordingly
follow
his
advice
,
and
find
the
abb'e
in
his
morning
-
gown
and
slipper
,
with
three
huge
night
-
cap
on
his
head
,
and
a
crape
hat
band
tie
over
the
middle
of
his
face
,
by
way
of
bandage
to
his
nose
.
 
<EOS>
He
receive
his
visiter
with
the
most
ridiculous
solemnity
,
be
still
a
stranger
to
the
purport
of
their
errand
;
but
soon
as
the
Westphalian
declare
they
be
come
in
consequence
of
his
billet
,
in
order
to
ask
pardon
for
the
undesigned
offence
they
have
give
,
his
feature
retrive
their
natural
vivacity
,
and
he
profess
himself
perfectly
satisfied
with
their
polite
acknowledgement
.
 
<EOS>
then
they
condole
him
upon
the
evil
plight
of
his
nose
,
and
see
some
mark
upon
his
shirt
,
ask
with
seem
concern
,
if
he
have
lose
any
blood
in
the
fray
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
interrogation
,
he
reply
,
that
he
have
still
a
sufficient
quantity
leave
for
the
occasion
of
his
friend
;
and
that
he
should
deem
it
his
great
glory
,
to
expend
the
last
drop
of
it
in
their
service
.
    
<EOS>
matter
be
thus
amicably
adjust
,
they
prevail
upon
him
to
uncase
his
nose
,
which
retain
no
sign
of
the
outrage
he
have
suffer
;
and
the
amusement
of
the
day
be
concert
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
in
consequence
of
this
plan
,
that
after
the
comedy
,
they
be
entertain
at
the
count
's
lodging
,
where
quadrille
be
propose
by
the
abbe
,
as
the
most
innocent
pastime
,
and
the
proposal
be
immediately
embrace
by
all
present
,
and
by
none
with
more
alacrity
than
by
our
adventurer
,
who
without
put
forth
a
moiety
of
his
terror
,
go
home
with
twenty
louis
clear
gain
:
though
,
far
from
believe
himself
greatly
superior
to
the
rest
of
the
party
in
the
artifice
of
play
,
he
justly
suspect
that
they
have
conceal
their
skill
,
with
a
view
of
strip
him
on
some
other
occasion
;
for
he
could
not
suppose
,
that
person
of
their
figure
and
character
should
be
,
in
reality
,
such
novice
as
they
affect
to
appear
.
     
<EOS>
He
overlook
the
advance
of
his
friend
,
and
smart
severely
for
his
neglect
.
   
<EOS>
steel
with
this
cautious
maxim
he
guard
himself
from
their
united
endeavour
,
in
sundry
subsequent
attack
,
by
which
his
first
conjecture
be
confirm
,
and
still
come
off
conqueror
,
by
virtue
of
his
unparallelled
finesse
and
discretion
:
<EOS>
till
at
length
they
seem
to
despair
of
make
him
their
prey
,
and
the
count
to
drop
some
hint
,
import
a
desire
of
see
him
more
closely
united
to
the
view
and
interest
of
their
triumvirate
.
    
<EOS>
but
Ferdinand
,
who
be
altogether
selfish
,
and
quite
solitary
in
his
prospect
,
discourage
all
those
advance
;
be
resolve
to
trade
upon
his
own
bottom
only
,
and
to
avoid
all
such
connexion
with
any
person
or
society
whatever
;
much
more
,
with
a
set
of
raw
adventurer
whose
talent
he
despise
.
 
<EOS>
with
these
sentiment
,
he
still
maintain
the
dignity
and
reserve
of
his
first
appearance
among
them
,
and
rather
inhanced
than
diminish
that
idea
of
importance
which
he
have
inspire
at
the
beginning
;
because
,
besides
his
other
qualification
,
they
give
him
credit
for
the
address
with
which
he
keep
himself
superior
to
their
united
design
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
thus
enjoy
his
pre
-
heminence
,
together
with
the
fruit
of
his
success
at
play
,
which
he
manage
so
discreetly
,
as
never
to
incur
the
reputation
of
an
adventurer
;
he
one
day
chance
to
be
at
the
ordinary
,
when
the
company
be
surprise
by
the
entrance
of
such
a
figure
as
have
never
appear
before
in
that
place
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
no
other
than
a
person
habit
in
the
exact
uniform
of
an
english
jockey
.
 
<EOS>
His
leathern
cap
,
cut
bob
,
fustian
frock
,
flannel
waistcoat
,
buff
breech
,
hunt
boot
and
whip
,
be
sufficient
of
themselves
to
furnish
out
a
phaenomenon
for
the
admiration
of
all
Paris
:
but
these
peculiarity
be
render
still
more
conspicuous
by
the
behaviour
of
the
man
who
own
them
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
cross
the
threshold
of
the
outward
door
,
he
produce
such
a
sound
from
the
smack
of
his
whip
,
as
equal
the
explosion
of
an
ordinary
cohorn
;
and
then
break
forth
into
the
hollow
of
a
fox
-
hunter
,
which
he
utter
with
all
its
variation
,
in
a
strain
of
vociferation
,
that
seem
to
astonish
and
confound
the
whole
assembly
,
to
whom
he
introduce
himself
and
his
spaniel
,
by
exclaim
in
a
tone
something
less
melodious
than
the
cry
of

"

<EOS>
this

that
the

him
for

their

Thof

I
believe
as
how
we
have
our

better

for

the

be
strike
dumb
with
amazement

at
the

appearance

deportment

while
the

be
over

whelm
with
shame

wary
silence

for

he
be
inwardly
transport
with
joy
at

He
consider
him
as
a
genuine

rich
country
booby
,
of
the
right
english
growth

fresh
as
import

and
his
heart
throb
with
rapture
,
when
he
hear
Sir
Stentor
value
himself
upon
the
lining
of
his
pocket
:
<EOS>
he
foresaw
,
indeed
,
that
the
other
knight
would
endeavour
to
reserve
him
for
his
own
game
;
but
he
be
too
conscious
of
his
own
accomplishment
,
to
think
he
should
find
great
difficulty
in
supersede
the
influence
of
Sir
Giles
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
the
new
comer
be
by
his
friend
,
help
to
some
ragout
,
which
please
his
palate
so
well
,
that
he
declare
he
should
now
make
a
hearty
meal
,
for
the
first
time
,
since
he

cross
the

Ferdinand
seize
this
opportunity

insinuate
himself
into

he
be
glad
to
find
there
be
any
thing
in

that
be
agreeable
to

<EOS>
to
this
compliment
the

reply

surprize

<EOS>
so
speak
,
he
thurst
out
his
right
hand
across
the
table
,
and
shake
our
hero
by
the
fist
,
with
such
violence
of
civility
,
as
prove
very
grievous
to
a
french
marquis
,
who
,
in
help
himself
to
soup
,
be
jostle
in
such
a
manner
,
as
to
overturn
the

in
his

<EOS>
the
Englishman
see
the
mischief
he
have
produce
,
cry
,
"
<EOS>
no
offence
,
I
hope
,
"
in
a
tone
of
vociferation
,
which
the
marquis
in
all
probability
misconstrue
:
for
he
begin
to
model
his
feature
into
a
very
sublime
and
peremptory
look
,
when
Fathom
interpret
the
apology
,
and
at
the
same
time
,
inform
Sir
Stentor
,
that
although
he
himself
have
not
the
honour
of
be
an
Englishman
,
he
have
always
entertain
a
most
particular
veneration
for
the
country
,
and
learn
the
language
in
consequence
of
that
esteem

<EOS>
"

answer
the
knight
,
"
I
think
myself
the
more
obliged
to
you
for
your
kind
opinion

if
you

for
there

here
he
be
interrupt
by
an
article
of
the
second
course

that
seem
to
give
him
great
disturbance
:
this
be
a
roasted
leveret
very
strong
of
the
fumet

which
happen
to
be
place
directly
under
his
nose

<EOS>
His
sense
of
smell
be
no
sooner
encounter
by
the
effluvia
of
this
delicious
fare
,
than
he
start
up
from
table
,
exclaim
.
 
<EOS>
"
Odd
's
my
liver
!
<EOS>
here
be
a
piece
of
carrion
,
that
I
would
not

in

tis
enough
to
make
any

both
gut

and
indeed
,
by
the
wry
face
he
make
while
he
run
to
the
door
,
his
stomach
seem
ready
to
justify
this
last
assertion

<EOS>
the
abb'e
,
who
conclude
from
these
symptom
of
disgust
,
that
the
leveret
be
not
sufficiently
stale
,
begin
to
exhibit
mark
of
discontent
,
and
desire
that
it
may
be
bring
to
the
other
end
of
the
table

for
his
examination

<EOS>
He
accordingly
hang
over
it
with
the
most
greedy
appetite
,
feast
his
nostril
with
the
steam
of
animal
putrefaction
;
and
at
length
declare
that
the
marceau
be
passable

though
he
own
it
would
have
be
highly
perfect

have
it

another

nevertheless

mouth
be
not

for
in

do
justice
to
the
desert
.
    
<EOS>
but
what
he
seem
to
relish
better
than
any
other
part
of
the
entertainment
,
be
the
conversation
of
our
adventurer
,
whom
,
after
dinner
,
he
beg
to
have
the
honour
of
treat
with
a
dish
of
coffee
;
to
the
seeming
mortification
of
his
brother
knight
,
over
which
Fathom
exult
in
his
own
heart
.
    
<EOS>
in
short
,
our
hero
,
by
his
affability
and
engage
deportment
,
immediately
gain
possession
of
Sir
Stentor
's
good
grace
:
insomuch
,
that
he
desire
to
crack
a
bottle
with
him
in
the
evening
,
and
they
repair
to
an
auberge
,
whither
<EOS>
his
fellow
knight
accompany
them
,
not
without
manifest
sign
of
reluctance
.
 
<EOS>
there
the
stranger
give
a
loose
to
jollity
;
though
at
first
he
damn
the
Burgundy
as
a
poor
thin
liquor
,
that
run
through
him
in
a
twinkling
,
and
instead
of
warm
,
cool
his
heart
and
bowel
:
however
,
it
insensibly
seem
to
give
the
lie
to
his
imputation
;
for
his
spirit
rise
to
a
more
elevated
pitch
of
mirth
and
good
fellowship
;
he
sing
,
or
rather
roar
,
the
Early
Horn
,
so
as
to
alarm
the
whole
neighbourhood
,
and
begin
to
slabber
his
companion
,
with
a
most
bearlike
affection
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
whatever
haste
he
make
to
the
goal
of
ebriety
,
he
be
distance
by
his
brother
baronet
,
who
,
from
the
beginning
of
the
party
,
have
make
little
other
use
of
his
mouth
,
than
to
receive
the
glass
,
and
now
sink
down
upon
the
floor
,
in
a
state
of
temporary
annihilation
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
immediately
carry
to
bed
by
the
direction
of
Ferdinand
,
who
now
see
himself
in
a
manner
possessor
of
that
mine
,
to
which
he
have
make
such
eager
and
artful
advance
.
    
<EOS>
that
he
may
,
therefore
,
carry
on
the
approach
in
the
same
cautious
manner
,
he
gradually
shake
off
the
trammel
of
sobriety
,
give
a
loose
to
that
spirit
of
freedom
,
which
good
liquor
commonly
inspire
,
and
in
the
familiarity
of
drunkenness
,
own
himself
head
of
a
noble
family
of
Poland
,
from
which
he
have
be
oblige
to
absent
himself
on
account
of
an
affair
of
honour
,
not
yet
compromise
.
    
<EOS>
have
make
this
confession
,
and
lay
strong
injunction
of
secresy
upon
Sir
Stentor
,
his
countenance
seem
to
acquire
from
every
succeed
glass
,
a
new
symptom
of
intoxication
:
they
renew
their
embrace
,
swear
eternal
friendship
from
that
day
,
and
swallow
fresh
bumper
,
till
both
be
,
in
all
appearance
,
quite
over
power
,
they
begin
to
yawn
in
concert
,
and
even
nod
in
their
chair
.
 
<EOS>
the
knight
seem
to
resent
the
attack
of
slumber
,
as
so
many
impertinent
attempt
to
interrupt
their
entertainment
;
he
curse
his
own
propensity
to
sleep
,
impute
it
to
the
damned
french
climate
,
and
propose
to
engage
in
some
pastime
that
would
keep
them
awake
.
    
<EOS>
"
Odd

the

there

upon

<EOS>
to
this
proposal
<EOS>
Fathom
reply
,
he
be
quite
ignorant
of
all
the
game
he
have
mention
;
but
,
in
order
to
amuse
Sir
Stentor
,
he
would
play
with
him
at
lansquenet
,
for
a
trifle
,
as
he
have
lay
it
down
for
a
maxim
,
to
risk
nothing
considerable
at
play
,
"
waund
,
answer
the
knight
<EOS>
,
I
hope
you
do
not
think
I
come
here
in
quest
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
thank
God
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
good
landed
estate
worth
five
thousand

owe
no
man
a
halfpenny

I
question
whether
there
be
many
count
in
your
nation
,
<EOS>
no
offence
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
that
can
say
a
bold
word
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
your
lambskin
net
,
I
know
nothing
of
the
matter
:
but
I
will
toss
up
with
you
for
a
guinea
,
cross
or
pile
as
the
saying
be
,
or
if
there
be
such
a
thing
in
this
country
as
a
box
and
dice
,
I
love
to
hear
the
bone
rattle
sometimes
.
"
    
<EOS>
Fathom
find
some
difficulty
in
conceal
his
joy
,
at
the
mention
of
this
last
amusement
,
which
have
be
one
of
his
chief
study
,
and
in
which
he
have
make
such
progress
,
that
he
could
calculate
all
the
chance
with
the
utmost
exactness
and
certainty
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
make
shift
to
contain
himself
,
within
due
bound
,
and
with
seem
indifference
,
consent
to
pass
away
an
hour
at
hazard
,
provide
the
implement
could
be
procure

<EOS>
accordingly
,
the
landlord
be
consult
,
and
their
desire
gratify
;
the
dice
be
produce
,
and
the
table
resound
with
the
effect
of
their
mutual
eagerness

<EOS>
Fortune
,
at
first
,
declare
for
the
Englishman
,
who
be
permit
by
our
adventurer
to
win
twenty
broad
piece
;

he
be
so
elated
with
his
success
,
as
to
accompany
every
lucky
throw
with
a
loud
burst
of
laughter
,
and
other
savage
and
simple
manifestation
of
excessive
joy
,
exclaim
in
a
tone
something
less
sweet
than
the
bellowing
of
a
bull
;

"
    
<EOS>
Fathom
draw
happy
presage
from
these
boyish
rapture
,
and
after
have
indulge
them
for
some
time
,
begin
to
avail
himself
of
his
arithmetic
,
in
consequence
of
which
the
knight
be
oblige
to
refund
the
great
part
of
his
winning
:
then
he
alter
his
note
,
and
become
as
intemperate
in
his
chagrin
,
as
he
have
be
before
immoderate
in
his
mirth
.
 
<EOS>
He
curse
himself
and
his
whole
generation
,
damn
his
bad
luck
,
stamp
with
his
foot
opon
the
floor
,
and
challenge
Ferdinand
to
double
stake
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
very
welcome
proposal
to
our
hero
,
who
find
Sir
Stenton
,
just
such
a
subject
as
he
have
long
desire
to
encounter
with
;
the
more
the
Englishman
lay
,
the
more
he
lose
,
and
Fathom
take
care
to
inflame
his
passion
,
by
certain
well
-
time
sarcasm
upon
his
want
of
judgment
,
 
'
<EOS>
till
at
length
he
become
quite
outrageous
,
swear
the
dice
be
false
,
and
throw
them
out
at
the
window
;
pull
off
his
perriwig
,
and
commit
it
to
the
flame
,
speak
with
the
most
rancorous
contempt
off
his
adversary
's
skill
,
insist
upon
his
have
strip
many
a
well
man
,
for
all
he
be
a
count
,
and
threaten
that
before
they
part
,
he
should
not
only
look
like
a
Pole
,
but
also
smell
like
a
Pole
cat
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
a
spirit
which
our
adventurer
industriously
keep
up
,
observe
that
the
English
be
dupe
to
all
the
world
;
and
that
in
point
of
genius
and
address
,
they
be
no
more
than
noisy
braggadocio
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
another
pair
of
dice
be
procure
;
the
stake
be
again
raise'd
,
and
after
several
vicissitude
,
fortune
declare
so
much
in
favour
of
the
knight
,
that
Fathom
lose
all
the
money
in
his
pocket
,
amount
to
a
pretty
considerable
sum
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
he
be
warm
into
uncommon
eagerness
and
impatience
;
be
equally
pique
at
the
success
and
provoking
exultation
of
his
antagonist
,
whom
he
now
invite
to
his
lodging
,
in
order
to
decide
the
contest
:
 
<EOS>
Sir
Stentor
comply
with
his
request
;
the
dispute
be
renew
with
various
success
,
till
towards
day
-
light
,
Ferdinand
see
this
noisy
,
raw
,
unexperienced
simpleton
,
carry
off
all
his
ready
cash
,
together
with
his
jewel
,
and
almost
every
thing
that
be
valuable
about
his
person
;
and
to
crown
the
whole
,
the
victor
,
at
parting
,
tell
him
with
a
most
intolerable
sneer
,
that
so
soon
as
the
count
should
receive
another
remittance
from
Poland
,
he
would
give
him
his
revenge
.
     
<EOS>
He
bear
his
fate
like
a
philosopher
;
and
contract
acquaintance
with
a
very
remarkable
personage
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
a
proper
subject
for
our
hero
to
moralize
upon
;
and
accordingly
,
it
do
not
pass
without
his
remark
;
he
find
himself
fairly
foil
at
his
own
weapon
,
reduce
to
indigence
in
a
foreign
land
,
and
,
what
he
chiefly
regret
,
rob
of
all
those
gay
expectation
he
have
indulge
from
his
own
suppose
excellence
in
the
wile
of
fraud
;
for
,
upon
a
little
recollection
he
plainly
perceive
he
have
fall
a
sacrifice
to
the
confederacy
he
have
refuse
to
join
;
and
do
not
at
all
doubt
,
that
the
dice
be
load
for
his
destruction
:
but
instead
of
beat
his
head
against
the
wall
,
tear
his
hair
,
imprecate
vain
curse
upon
himself
,
or
betray
other
frantic
symptom
of
despair
,
he
resolve
to
accommodate
himself
to
his
fate
,
and
profit
by
the
lesson
he
have
so
dearly
buy
.
    
<EOS>
with
this
intention
,
he
immediately
dismiss
his
valet
,
quit
his
lodging
,
retire
to
an
obscure
street
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
,
and
cover
one
eye
with
a
large
patch
of
black
silk
,
present
himself
in
quality
of
a
musician
,
to
the
director
of
the
opera
,
who
,
upon
hear
a
trial
of
his
skill
,
receive
him
into
the
band
,
without
further
question
.
 
<EOS>
while
he
continue
in
this
situation
,
he
not
only
improve
his
taste
and
execution
in
musick
,
but
likewise
find
frequent
opportunity
to
extend
his
knowledge
of
mankind
;
for
,
besides
the
employment
he
exercise
in
public
,
he
be
often
concerned
in
private
concert
that
be
give
in
the
hotel
of
nobleman
;
by
which
mean
,
he
become
more
and
more
acquainted
with
the
person
,
manner
and
character
of
high
life
,
which
he
contemplate
with
the
most
industrious
attention
,
as
a
spectator
,
who
be
altogether
unconcerned
in
the
performance
,
be
at
more
liberty
to
observe
and
enjoy
the
particular
of
the
entertainment
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
in
one
of
those
assembly
,
he
have
the
pleasure
of
see
his
friend
Sir
Stentor
,
dress
in
the
most
fashionable
manner
,
and
behave
with
all
the
overstrain
politesse
of
a
native
Frenchman
:
<EOS>
he
be
accompany
by
his
brother
knight
and
the
abbe
,
and
this
triumvirate
,
even
in
Fathom
's
hearing
,
give
a
most
ludicrous
detail
of
the
finesse
they
have
practise
upon
the
polish
count
,
to
their
entertainer
,
who
be
ambassador
from
a
certain
court
,
and
make
himself
extremely
merry
with
the
particular
of
the
relation
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
they
make
shift
to
describe
some
of
the
circumstance
in
such
a
ridiculous
light
,
that
our
adventurer
himself
,
smart
as
he
be
with
the
disgrace
,
could
not
help
laugh
in
secret
at
the
account
.
 
<EOS>
He
afterwards
make
it
his
business
to
enquire
into
the
character
of
the
two
british
knight
,
and
understand
they
be
notorious
sharper
,
who
have
come
abroad
for
the
good
of
their
country
,
and
now
hunt
in
couple
among
a
french
pack
,
that
disperse
themselves
through
the
public
ordinary
,
walk
,
and
spectacle
,
in
order
to
make
a
prey
of
incautious
stranger
.
    
<EOS>
the
pride
of
Ferdinand
be
pique
at
this
information
;
and
he
be
even
animate
with
the
desire
of
make
reprisal
upon
this
fraternity
,
from
which
he
ardently
long
to
retrieve
his
honour
and
effect
;
but
the
issue
of
his
last
adventure
have
reinforce
his
caution
;
and
for
the
present
,
he
find
mean
to
suppress
the
dictate
of
his
avarice
and
ambition
;
resolve
to
employ
his
whole
penetration
in
reconnoitre
the
ground
,
before
he
should
venture
to
take
the
field
again
.
    
<EOS>
He
therefore
continue
to
act
the
part
of
a
one
-
eyed
fidler
,
under
the
name
of
Fadini
,
and
live
with
incredible
frugality
,
that
he
may
save
a
purse
for
his
future
operation
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
manner
have
he
proceed
for
the
space
of
ten
month
,
during
which
he
acquire
a
competent
knowledge
of
the
city
of
Paris
,
when
his
curiosity
be
attract
by
certain
peculiarity
in
the
appearance
of
a
man
,
who
live
in
one
of
the
upper
apartment
belong
to
the
house
,
in
which
he
himself
have
fix
his
habitation
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
a
tall
,
thin
,
meagre
figure
,
with
a
long
black
beard
,
an
aquiline
nose
,
a
brown
complexion
,
and
a
most
piercing
vivacity
in
his
eye
:
he
seem
to
be
about
the
age
of
fifty
,
wear
the
persian
habit
,
and
there
be
a
remarkable
severity
in
his
aspect
and
demeanour
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
our
adventurer
have
be
fellow
lodger
for
some
time
,
and
,
accord
to
the
laudable
custom
of
these
day
,
have
hitherto
remain
as
much
estranged
to
one
another
,
as
if
they
have
live
on
opposite
side
of
the
globe
;
but
of
late
,
the
Persian
seem
to
regard
our
hero
with
particular
attention
;
when
they
chance
to
meet
on
the
stair
-
case
,
or
elsewhere
,
he
bow
to
Ferdinand
with
great
solemnity
,
and
compliment
him
with
the
Pas
<EOS>
:
he
even
proceed
in
the
course
of
this
communication
,
to
open
his
mouth
,
and
salute
him
with
a
good
morrow
,
and
sometimes
make
the
common
remark
upon
the
weather
.
 
<EOS>
Fathom
,
who
be
naturally
complaisant
,
do
not
discourage
these
advance
:
on
the
contrary
,
he
behave
to
him
with
mark
of
particular
respect
,
and
one
day
,
desire
the
favour
of
his
company
to
breakfast
.
    
<EOS>
this
invitation
the
stranger
decline
with
due
acknowledgement
,
on
pretence
of
be
out
of
order
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
our
adventurer
bethink
himself
of
question
the
landlord
concern
his
outlandish

<EOS>
His
curiosity
be
rather
inflame
than
satisfied
with
the
information
he
could
obtain
from
this
quarter
;
for
,
all
he
learn
,
be
,
that
the
Persian
go
by
the
name
of
Ali
Beker
,
and
that
he
have
live
in
the
house
,
for
the
space
of
four
month
,
in
a
most
solitary
and
parsimonious
manner
,
without
be
visit
by
one
live
soul
;
that
,
for
some
time
after
his
arrival
,
he
have
be
often
hear
to
groan
dismally
in
the
night
,
and
even
to
exclaim
in
an
unknown
language
,
as
if
he
have
labour
under
some
grievous
affliction
;
and
though
the
first
transport
of
his
grief
have
subside
,
it
be
easy
to
perceive
,
he
still
indulge
a
deep
root
melancholy
,
for
the
tear
be
frequently
observe
to
trickle
down
his
beard
.
 
<EOS>
the
commissaire
of
the
quarter
have
at
first
order
this
Oriental
to
be
watch
in
his
out
-
going
,
accord
to
the
maxim
of
the
french
police
;
but
his
life
be
find
so
regular
and
inoffensive
,
that
this
precaution
be
soon
set
aside
.
    
<EOS>
any
man
of
humane
sentiment
,
from
the
knowledge
of
these
particular
,
would
have
be
prompt
to
offer
his
service
to
the
forlorn
stranger
:
but
as
our
hero
be
devoid
of
all
these
infirmity
of
human
nature
,
it
be
necessary
that
other
motive
should
produce
the
same
effect
:
his
curiosity
,
therefore
,
join
with
the
hope
of
convert
the
confidence
of
Ali
to
his
own
emolument
,
effectually
impel
him
towards
his
acquaintance
;
and
in
a
little
time
,
they
begin
to
relish
the
conversation
of
each
other
:
for
,
as
the
reader
may
have
already
observe
,
Fathom
possess
all
the
art
of
insinuation
;
and
have
discernment
,
enough
to
perceive
an
air
of
dignity
in
the
Persian
,
which
the
humility
of
his
circumstance
could
not
conceal
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
,
moreover
,
a
man
of
good
understanding
,
not
without
a
tincture
of
letter
,
perfectly
well
-
breed
,
though
in
a
ceremonious
stile
,
extremely
moral
in
his
discourse
,
and
scrupulously
nice
in
his
notion
of
honour
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
conform
himself
in
all
respect
,
to
the
other
's
opinion
,
and
manage
his
discretion
so
as
to
pass
upon
him
,
for
a
gentleman
reduce
by
misfortune
,
to
the
exercise
of
an
employment
which
be
altogether
unsuitable
to
his
birth
and
quality
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
earnest
and
repeat
tender
of
his
good
office
to
the
stranger
,
and
press
him
to
make
use
of
his
purse
,
with
such
cordial
perseverance
,
that
at
length
Ali
's
reserve
be
overcome
,
and
he
condescend
to
borrow
of
him
a
small
sum
,
which
,
in
all
probability
,
save
his
life
;
for
he
have
be
drive
to
the
utmost
extremity
of
want
,
before
he
would
accept
of
this
assistance
.
    
<EOS>
Fathom
,
have
gradually
steal
into
his
good
grace
,
begin
to
take
notice
of
many
piteous
sigh
that
escape
him
,
in
the
moment
of
their
intercourse
,
and
seem
to
denote
an
heart
fraught
with
woe
;
and
on
pretence
of
administre
consolation
and
counsel
,
beg
leave
to
know
the
cause
of
his
distress
;
observe
that
his
mind
would
be
disburthene
by
such
communication
,
and
perhaps
his
grief
alleviate
by
some
mean
which
they
may
jointly
concert
,
and
execute
in
his
behalf
.
    
<EOS>
Ali
,
thus
sollicite
,
would
often
shake
his
head
with
mark
of
extreme
sorrow
and
despondence
,
and
while
the
tear
gush
from
his
eye
,
declare
that
his
distress
be
beyond
the
power
of
any
remedy
but
death
,
and
that
by
make
our
hero
his
confident
,
he
should
only
extend
his
unhappiness
to
a
friend
,
without
feel
the
least
remission
of
his
own
torture
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
those
repeat
declaration
,
Ferdinand
,
who
be
well
enough
acquaint
with
the
mind
of
man
,
to
know
that
such
importunity
be
seldom
or
never
disagreeable
,
redouble
his
instance
,
together
with
his
expression
of
sympathy
and
esteem
,
until
the
stranger
be
prevail
upon
to
gratify
his
curiosity
and
benevolence
.
 
<EOS>
have
therefore
secure
the
chamber
-
door
,
one
night
,
while
all
the
rest
of
the
family
be
asleep
,
the
unfortunate
Hali
disclose
himself
in
these
word
.
     
<EOS>
the
history
of
the
noble
Castilian
.
   
<EOS>
I
should
be
ungrateful
as
well
as
unwise
,
do
I
longer
resist
the
desire
you
express
to
know
the
particular
of
that
destiny
,
which
hath
drive
me
to
this
miserable
disguise
,
and
render
me
in
all
consideration
the
most
wretched
of
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
feel
your
friendship
,
be
confident
of
your
honour
,
and
though
my
misfortune
be
such
as
can
never
be
repair
,
because
I
be
utterly
cut
off
from
hope
,
which
be
the
wretch
's
last
comfort
,
yet
I
may
,
by
your
mean
,
be
enable
to
bear
them
with
some
degree
of
fortitude
and
resignation
.
    
<EOS>
Know
then
,
my
name
be
not
Hali
;
neither
be
I
of
persian
extraction
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
once
the
honour
to
own
myself
a
Castilian
,
and
be
under
the
appellation
of
Don
Diego
de
Zelos
,
respect
as
the
head
of
one
of
the
most
ancient
family
of
that
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
Judge
then
how
severe
that
distress
must
be
,
which
compel
a
Spaniard
to
renounce
his
country
,
his
honour
and
his
name
.
 
<EOS>
My
youth
be
not
spend
in
inglorious
ease
,
neither
do
it
waste
unheeded
in
the
roll
of
fame
:
before
I
have
attain
the
age
of
nineteen
,
I
be
twice
wound
in
battle
;
I
once
fortunately
recover
the
standard
of
the
regiment
to
which
I
belong
,
after
it
have
be
seize
by
the
enemy
;
and
at
another
occasion
make
shift
to
save
the
life
of
my
colonel
when
he
lie
at
the
mercy
of
an
enraged
barbarian
.
    
<EOS>
He
<EOS>
that
think
I
recapitulate
these
particular
,
out
of
ostentation
,
do
wrong
to
the
unhappy
Don
Diego
de
Zelos
,
who
,
in
have
perform
these
little
act
of
gallantry
,
think
he
have
do
nothing
,
but
simply
approve
himself
worthy
of
be
call
a
Castalian
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
only
to
do
justice
to
my
own
character
,
and
to
make
you
acquaint
with
one
of
the
most
remarkable
incident
of
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
my
fate
,
during
my
third
campaign
,
to
command
a
troop
of
horse
in
the
regiment
of
Don
Gonzales
Orgullo
,
between
whom
and
my
father
a
family
feud
<EOS>
have
long
be
maintain
with
great
enmity
,
and
that
gentleman
do
not
leave
me
without
reason
to
believe
he
rejoice
at
the
opportunity
of
exercise
his
resentment
upon
his
adversary
's
son
;
for
he
with
-
hold
from
me
that
countenance
which
my
fellow
-
officer
enjoy
,
and
find
mean
to
subject
me
to
diver
mortification
,
of
which
I
be
not
at
liberty
to
complain
.
    
<EOS>
these
I
bear
in
silence
,
for
some
time
,
as
part
of
my
probation
in
the
character
of
a
soldier
;
resolve
nevertheless
,
to
employ
my
interest
at
court
,
for
a
removal
into
another
corps
,
and
to
take
some
future
opportunity
of
explain
my
sentiment
to
Don
Gonzales
,
upon
the
injustice
of
his
behaviour
.
    
<EOS>
while
I
animate
myself
with
these
sentiment
against
the
discouragement
I
undergo
,
and
the
hard
duty
to
which
I
be
daily
expose
,
it
be
our
fate
to
be
concern
in
the
battle
of
Saragossa
,
where
our
regiment
be
so
severely
handle
by
the
English
infantry
,
that
it
be
force
to
give
ground
with
the
loss
of
one
half
of
its
officer
and
man
.
 
<EOS>
Don
Gonzales
,
who
act
as
brigadier
in
another
wing
,
be
inform
of
our
fate
,
and
dread
the
disgrace
of
his
corp
,
which
have
never
turn
back
to
the
enemy
,
put
spur
to
his
horse
,
and
ride
across
the
field
at
full
speed
,
rally
our
broken
squadron
,
and
lead
us
back
to
the
charge
,
with
such
intrepidity
of
behaviour
,
as
do
not
fail
to
inspire
us
all
with
uncommon
courage
and
alacrity
:
for
my
own
part
,
I
think
myself
doubly
interested
,
to
distinguish
my
valour
;
not
only
on
account
of
my
own
glory
,
but
likewise
on
the
supposition
,
that
as
I
be
act
under
the
eye
of
Gonzales
,
my
conduct
would
be
narrowly
observe
.
    
<EOS>
I
therefore
exert
myself
with
unusual
vigour
,
and
as
he
begin
the
attack
with
the
remain
of
my
troop
,
fight
close
by
his
side
,
during
the
rest
of
the
engagement
.
    
<EOS>
I
even
acquire
his
applause
in
the
very
heat
of
battle
:
when
his
hat
be
strike
off
,
and
his
horse
fall
under
him
,
I
accommodate
and
remount
him
upon
my
own
,
and
have
seize
for
my
own
use
,
another
that
belong
to
a
common
trooper
,
attend
this
stern
commander
as
before
,
and
second
him
in
all
his
repeat
effort
:
but
it
be
impossible
to
withstand
the
number
and
impituosity
of
the
foe
,
and
Don
Gonzales
have
have
the
mortification
to
see
his
regiment
cut
in
piece
,
and
the
great
part
of
the
army
route
,
be
fain
to
yield
to
the
fortune
of
the
day
;
yet
he
retire
as
become
a
man
of
honour
and
a
Castilian
:
<EOS>
that
is
,
he
march
off
with
great
deliberation
,
in
the
rear
of
the
spanish
troop
,
and
frequently
face
about
to
check
the
pursuit
of
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
this
exercise
of
his
courage
have
<EOS>
well
nigh
cost
him
his
life
;
for
,
in
one
of
these
wheeling
,
he
be
leave
almost
alone
,
and
a
small
party
of
the
portuguese
horse
have
actually
cut
off
our
communication
with
the
retreat
force
of
Spain
.
    
<EOS>
in
this
dilemma
,
we
have
no
other
chance
for
save
our
life
and
liberty
,
than
that
of
open
a
passage
,
sword
in
hand
;
and
this
be
what
Gonzales
instantly
resolve
to
attempt
.
    
<EOS>
We
accordingly
recommend
our
soul
to
God
,
and
charge
the
line
abreast
of
another
,
bore
down
all
opposition
,
and
be
in
a
fair
of
accomplish
our
retreat
,
without
further
danger
;
but
the
gallant
Orgullo
,
in
cross
a
ditch
,
have
the
misfortune
to
be
throw
from
his
horse
,
and
be
almost
the
same
instant
overtake
by
one
of
the
portuguese
dragoon
,
whose
sword
be
already
suspend
over
his
head
,
as
he
lie
half
stunned
with
his
fall
;
when
I
ride
up
,
discharge
a
pistol
in
the
ruffian
's
brain
,
and
seat
my
colonel
on
his
horse
,
have
the
good
fortune
to
conduct
him
to
a
place
of
safety
.
    
<EOS>
here
he
be
provide
with
such
accommodation
as
his
case
require
;
for
he
have
be
wound
in
the
battle
,
and
dangerously
bruise
by
his
fall
,
and
when
all
the
necessary
step
be
take
towards
his
recovery
,
I
desire
to
know
if
he
have
any
further
command
for
my
service
,
be
resolve
to
join
the
army
without
delay
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
proper
to
communicate
this
question
,
by
message
,
because
he
have
not
speak
one
word
to
me
,
during
our
retreat
,
notwithstanding
the
good
office
he
have
receive
at
my
hand
;
a
reserve
which
I
attribute
to
his
pride
,
and
resent
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
understand
my
intention
,
than
he
desire
to
see
me
in
his
apartment
,
and
as
near
as
I
can
remember
speak
to
this
effect
.
    
<EOS>
"
be
your
father
Don
Alonzo
alive
,
I
should
now
,
in
consequence
of
your
behaviour
,
banish
every
suggestion
of
resentment
,
and
solicit
his
friendship
,
with
great
sincerity
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
Don
Diego
,
your
virtue
hath
triumph
over
that
enmity
<EOS>
I
bear
your
house
,
and
I
upbraid
myself
with
the
ungenerous
treatment
you
have
suffer
under
my
command
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
enough
for
me
to
withdraw
that
rigour
which
it
be
unjust
to
exercise
,
and
would
be
wicked
to
maintain
:
 
I
must
likewise
attone
for
the
injury
you
have
sustain
,
and
make
some
suitable
acknowledgement
for
that
life
which
I
have
twice
to
-
day
owe
to
your
valour
and
generosity
.
    
<EOS>
whatever
interest
I
have
at
court
,
shall
be
employ
in
your
behalf
;
and
I
have
other
design
in
your
favour
,
which
shall
be
disclose
in
due
season
.
 
<EOS>
mean
<EOS>
while
,
I
desire
you
will
still
add
one
obligation
to
the
debt
which
I
have
already
incur
,
and
carry
this
billet
,
in
person
,
to
my
Estifania
,
who
,
from
the
news
of
this
fatal
overthrow
,
must
be
in
despair
upon
my
account
.
"
    
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
present
a
letter
direct
to
his
lady
,
which
I
receive
in
a
transport
of
joy
,
with
expression
suitable
to
the
occasion
,
and
immediately
set
out
for
his
country
house
,
which
happen
to
be
about
thirty
league
from
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
this
expedition
be
equally
glorious
and
interesting
:
for
my
thought
upon
the
road
be
engross
by
the
hope
of
see
Don
Orgullo
's
daughter
and
heiress
Antonia
,
who
be
report
to
be
a
young
lady
of
great
beauty
,
and
the
most
amiable
accomplishment
.
 
<EOS>
however
ridiculous
it
may
seem
,
for
a
man
to
conceive
a
passion
,
for
an
object
which
he
hath
never
beheld
,
certain
it
be
,
my
sentiment
be
so
much
prepossess
by
the
fame
of
her
qualification
,
that
I
must
have
fall
a
victim
to
her
charm
,
<EOS>
have
they
be
much
less
powerful
than
they
be
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
fatigue
I
have
undergo
in
the
field
,
I
close
not
an
eye
,
until
I
arrive
at
the
gate
of
Gonzales
,
be
determine
to
precede
the
report
of
the
battle
<EOS>
,
that
madam
d'Orgullo
may
not
be
alarm
for
the
life
of
her
husband
.
    
<EOS>
I
declare
my
errand
,
and
be
introduce
into
a
saloon
,
where
I
have
not
wait
above
three
minute
,
when
my
colonel
's
lady
appear
,
and
in
great
confusion
receive
the
letter
,
exclaim
,
<EOS>
"
Heaven
grant
that
Don
Gonzales
be
well
;
"
in
read
the
content
,
she
undergo
a
variety
of
agitation
;
but
when
she
have
peruse
the
whole
,
her
countenance
regain
its
serenity
,
and
regard
me
with
an
air
of
ineffable
complacency
,
"
Don
Diego
,
"
say
she
,
"
while
I
lament
the
national
calamity
,
in
the
defeat
of
our
army
,
I
at
the
same
time
,
feel
the
most
sincere
pleasure
,
in
see
you
upon
this
occasion
,
and
accord
to
the
direction
of
my
dear
lord
,
bid
you
heartily
welcome
to
this
house
,
as
his
preserver
and
friend

<EOS>
I
be
not
unacquainted
with
your

this
last
triumph
of
your

have
often
pray
to
Heaven
,
for
some
lucky
determination
of
that
fatal
quarrel
,
which
rage
so
long
between
the
family
of
Gonzales
and
your
father
's
house

<EOS>
My
prayer
have
be
hear
,
the
long
wish
-
for
reconciliation
be
now
effect
,
and
I
hope
nothing
will
ever
intervene
,
to
disturb
this
happy
union
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
to
this
polite
and
affectionate
declaration
,
I
make
such
a
reply
,
as
become
a
young
man
,
whose
heart
overflow
with
joy
and
benevolence
,
and
desire
to
know
how
soon
her
answer
to
my
commander
would
be
ready
,
that
I
may
gratify
his
impatience
,
with
all
possible
dispatch
.
    
<EOS>
after
have
thank
me
for
this
fresh
proof
of
my
attachment
,
she
beg
I
would
retire
into
a
chamber
,
and
repose
myself
from
the
uncommon
fatigue
I
must
have
undergo
;
but
,
find
I
persist
in
the
resolution
of
return
to
Don
Gonzales
,
without
allow
myself
the
least
benefit
of
sleep
,
she
leave
me
engage
in
conversation
with
an
uncle
of
Don
Gonzales
,
who
lodge
in
the
house
,
and
give
order
that
a
collation
should
be
prepare
in
another
apartment
,
while
she
retire
to
her
closet
,
and
write
a
letter
to
her
husband
.
    
<EOS>
in
less
than
an
hour
from
my
first
arrival
,
I
be
introduce
into
a
most
elegant
dining
-
room
,
where
a
magnificent
entertainment
be
serve
up
,
and
where
we
be
join
by
Donna
Estifania
,
and
her
beautiful
daughter
the
fair
Antonia
,
who
advance
,
with
the
most
amiable
sweetness
,
thank
me
in
very
warm
expression
of
acknowledgment
,
for
the
generosity
of
my
conduct
towards
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
ravish
with
her
first
appearance
,
which
far
exceed
my
imagination
,
and
my
faculty
be
so
disorder
by
this
address
,
that
I
answer
her
compliment
with
the
most
aukward
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
disorder
do
not
turn
to
my
prejudice
in
the
opinion
of
that
lovely
creature
,
who
have
often
tell
me
in
the
sequel
,
that
she
give
herself
credit
for
that
perplexity
in
my
behaviour
,
and
that
I
never
appear
more
worthy
of
her
regard
and
affection
,
than
at
that
juncture
,
when
my
dress
be
discompose
,
and
my
whole
person
disfigure
by
the
toil
and
duty
of
the
preceede
day
;
for
this
very
dishabille
present
itself
to
her
reflection
,
as
the
immediate
effect
of
that
very
merit
by
which
I
be
intitle
to
her
esteem
.
    
<EOS>
Wretch
that
I
be
!
<EOS>
to
survive
the
loss
of
such
an
excellent
woman
,
endear
to
my
remembrance
by
the
most
tender
office
of
wedlock
,
happily
exercise
for
the
space
of
five
and
twenty
year
!
 
<EOS>
foregive
these
tear
,
they
be
not
the
drop
of
weakness
,
but
remorse
.
    
<EOS>
not
to
trouble
you
with
idle
particular
,
suffice
it
to
say
,
I
be
favour
with
such
mark
of
distinction
,
by
madam
d'Orgullo
,
that
she
think
it
incumbent
upon
her
to
let
me
know
<EOS>
,
she
have
not
over
-
act
her
hospitality
,
and
while
we
sit
at
table
,
accost
me
in
these
word
:
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
be
surprised
,
Don
Diego
,
at
my
expression
of
regard
,
which
I
own
be
unusual
from
a
spanish
lady
,
to
a
young
cavalier
like
you
,
when
I
communicate
the
content
of
this
letter
from
Don
Gonzales
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
she
put
the
billet
into
my
hand
,
and
I
read
these
word
,
or
word
to
this
effect
,
    
"
amiable
Estifania
<EOS>
,
You
will
understand
,
that
I
be
as
well
as
a
person
can
possibly
be
,
who
hath
this
day
live
to
see
the
army
of
his
king
defeat
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
would
know
the
particular
of
this
unfortunate
action
,
your
curiosity
will
be
gratify
by
the
bearer
Don
Diego
de
Zelos
,
to
whose
virtue
and
bravery
<EOS>
I
be
twice
indebted
for
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
desire
you
will
receive
him
with
that
respect
and
gratitude
which
you
shall
think
due
for
such
an
obligation
;
and
in
entertain
him
,
dismiss
that
reserve
,
which
often
disgrace
the
spanish
hospitality
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
let
your
own
virtue
and
beneficence
conduct
you
upon
this
occasion
,
and
let
my
Antonia
's
endeavour
be
join
with
your
own
,
in
do
honour
to
the
preserver
of
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
Adieu
.
"
    
<EOS>
such
a
testimonial
could
not
fail
of
be
very
agreeable
to
a
young
soldier
,
who
by
this
time
have
begin
to
indulge
the
transport
hope
of
be
happy
in
the
arm
of
the
adorable
Antonia
.
 
<EOS>
I
profess
myself
extremely
happy
in
have
meet
with
an
opportunity
of
acquire
such
a
degree
of
my
colonel
's
esteem
,
entertain
them
with
a
detail
of
his
personal
prowess
in
the
battle
,
and
answer
all
their
question
with
that
moderation
which
every
man
ought
to
preserve
in
speaking
of
his
own
behaviour
.
 
<EOS>
Our
repast
be
end
,
I
take
my
leave
of
the
lady
,
and
at
parting
receive
a
letter
from
Donna
Estifania
to
her
husband
,
together
with
a
ring
of
great
value
,
which
she
beg
I
would
accept
,
as
a
token
of
her
esteem
.
 
<EOS>
thus
load
with
honour
and
caress
,
I
set
out
on
my
return
for
the
quarter
of
Don
Gonzales
,
who
could
scarce
credit
his
own
eye
when
I
deliver
his
lady
's
billet
;
for
he
think
it
impossible
to
perform
such
a
journey
in
so
short
a
time
.
    
<EOS>
when
he
have
glance
over
the
paper
,
"
Don
Diego
,
"
say
he
,
"
by
your
short
stay
,
one
would
imagine
you
have
meet
with
indifferent
reception
at
my
house
:
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Estifania
have
not
be
deficient
in
her
duty
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
answer
this
question
,
by
assure
him
,
my
entertainment
have
be
so
agreeable
in
all
respect
,
that
nothing
but
my
duty
to
him
could
have
induce
me
to
give
it
up
so
soon
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
turn
the
conversation
upon
Antonia
,
and
hint
his
intention
of
give
her
in
marriage
to
a
young
cavalier
,
for
whom
he
have
a
particular
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
much
affect
by
this
insinuation
,
which
seem
at
once
to
blast
all
my
hope
of
love
and
happiness
,
that
the
blood
forsook
my
face
;
I
be
seize
with
an
universal
trepidation
,
and
even
oblige
to
retire
,
on
pretence
of
be
suddenly
take
ill
.
    
<EOS>
Though
Gonzales
seem
to
impute
this
disorder
to
fatigue
and
want
of
rest
,
he
in
his
heart
ascribe
it
to
the
true
cause
,
and
after
have
sound
my
sentiment
to
his
own
satisfaction
,
bless
me
with
a
declaration
,
import
that
I
be
the
person
upon
whom
he
have
pitch
for
a
son
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
trouble
you
with
a
repetition
of
what
pass
on
this
interesting
occasion
,
but
proceed
to
observe
,
that
his
intention
in
my
favour
be
far
from
be
disagreeable
to
his
lady
;
and
that
in
a
little
time
,
I
have
the
good
fortune
to
espouse
the
charming
Antonia
,
who
submit
to
the
will
of
her
father
without
reluctance
.
    
<EOS>
soon
after
this
happy
event
,
I
be
,
by
the
influence
of
Don
Gonzales
,
join
to
my
own
interest
,
promote
to
the
command
of
a
regiment
,
and
serve
with
honour
during
the
remain
part
of
the
war
.
 
<EOS>
after
the
treaty
of
Utrecht
,
I
be
employ
in
reduce
the
Catalans
to
their
allegiance
,
and
in
an
action
with
these
obstinate
rebel
,
have
the
misfortune
to
lose
my
father
-
in
-
law
,
who
by
that
time
be
prefer
to
the
rank
of
a
major
-
general
.
 
<EOS>
the
virtuous
Estifania
do
not
long
survive
this
melancholly
accident
;
and
the
loss
of
these
indulgent
parent
make
such
a
deep
impression
upon
the
tender
heart
of
my
Antonia
,
that
I
take
the
first
opportunity
of
remove
her
from
a
place
,
in
which
every
object
serve
to
cherish
her
grief
,
to
a
pleasant
villa
,
near
the
city
of
Seville
,
which
I
purchase
on
account
of
its
agreeable
situation
.
    
<EOS>
that
I
may
the
more
perfectly
enjoy
the
possession
of
my
amiable
partner
,
who
could
no
longer
brook
the
thought
of
another
separation
,
peace
be
no
sooner
re
-
establish
,
than
I
obtain
leave
to
resign
my
commission
,
and
I
wholly
devote
myself
to
the
joy
of
a
domestic
life
.
    
<EOS>
Heaven
seem
to
smile
upon
our
union
,
by
bless
us
with
a
son
,
whom
,
however
,
it
be
pleased
to
recall
in
his
infancy
,
to
our
unspeakable
grief
and
mortification
;
but
our
mutual
chagrin
be
afterwards
alleviate
,
by
the
birth
of
a
daughter
,
who
seem
bear
with
every
accomplishment
to
excite
the
love
and
admiration
of
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
why
do
nature
debase
such
a
master
piece
with
the
mixture
of
an
allay
,
which
hath
involve
herself
and
her
whole
family
in
perdition
?
<EOS>
but
the
way
of
Providence
be
unsearchable
.
 
<EOS>
She
hath
pay
the
debt
of
her
degeneracy
;
peace
be
with
her
soul
!
<EOS>
the
honour
of
my
family
be
vindicate
;
though
by
a
sacrifice
which
hath
rob
me
of
every
thing
else
that
be
valuable
in
life
,
and
ruin
my
peace
past
all
redemption
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
my
friend
,
all
the
torture
that
human
tyranny
can
inflict
,
would
be
ease
,
tranquility
and
delight
,
to
the
unspeakable
pang
and
horror
I
have
feel
.
    
<EOS>
but
,
to
return
from
this
digression
:
Serafina
,
which
be
the
name
of
that
little
darling
,
as
she
grow
up
,
not
only
disclose
all
the
natural
grace
of
external
beauty
,
but
likewise
manifest
the
most
engaging
sweetness
of
disposition
,
and
a
capacity
for
acquire
with
ease
,
all
the
accomplishment
of
her
sex
.
    
<EOS>
'
Tis
impossible
to
convey
any
adequate
idea
of
a
parent
's
rapture
in
the
contemplation
of
such
a
fair
blossom
;
she
be
the
only
pledge
of
our
love
,
she
be
presumptive
heiress
to
a
large
fortune
,
and
likely
to
be
the
sole
representative
of
two
noble
castilian
family
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
the
delight
of
all
who
see
her
,
and
a
theme
of
praise
for
every
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
not
to
suppose
,
that
the
education
of
such
a
child
be
neglect
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
it
wholly
engross
the
attention
of
me
and
my
Antonia
,
and
her
proficiency
reward
our
care
.
 
<EOS>
before
she
have
attain
the
age
of
fifteen
,
she
be
mistress
of
every
elegant
qualification
,
natural
and
acquire
.
 
<EOS>
Her
person
be
,
by
that
time
,
the
confess
pattern
of
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
Her
voice
be
enchantingly
sweet
,
and
she
touch
the
lute
with
the
most
ravish
dexterity
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
and
earth
!
<EOS>
how
do
my
breast
dilate
with
joy
,
at
the
thought
of
have
give
birth
to
such
perfection
!
<EOS>
how
do
my
heart
gush
with
paternal
fondness
,
whenever
I
beheld
this
ornament
of
my
name
!
<EOS>
and
what
scene
of
endear
transport
,
have
I
enjoy
with
my
Antonia
,
in
mutual
congratulation
upon
our
parental
happiness
.
    
<EOS>
Serafina
,
accomplish
as
she
be
,
could
not
fail
to
make
conquest
among
the
spanish
cavalier
,
who
be
famous
for
sensibility
in
love
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
never
appear
without
a
numerous
train
of
admirer
,
and
though
we
have
breed
her
up
in
that
freedom
of
conversation
and
intercourse
,
which
hold
a
middle
space
,
between
the
french
license
and
spanish
restraint
,
she
be
now
so
much
expose
to
the
address
of
promiscuous
gallantry
,
that
we
find
it
necessary
to
retrench
the
liberty
of
our
house
;
and
behave
to
our
male
visitant
with
great
reserve
and
circumspection
,
that
our
honour
and
peace
may
run
no
risque
from
the
youth
and
inexperience
of
our
daughter
.
    
<EOS>
this
caution
produce
overture
from
a
great
many
young
gentleman
of
rank
and
distinction
,
who
court
my
alliance
by
demand
Serafina
in
marriage
;
and
from
the
number
,
I
have
actually
select
one
person
,
who
be
in
all
respect
worthy
the
possession
of
such
an
inestimable
prize
.
 
<EOS>
His
name
be
Don
Manuel
de
Mendoza
;
his
birth
be
noble
,
and
his
character
dignify
with
repeat
act
of
generosity
and
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
yet
before
I
would
signify
to
him
my
approbation
of
his
suit
,
I
resolve
to
inform
myself
,
whether
or
not
the
heart
of
Serafina
be
totally
unengage
,
and
indifferent
to
any
other
object
,
that
I
may
not
lay
a
tyrannical
restraint
upon
her
inclination
.
 
<EOS>
the
result
of
my
enquiry
be
a
full
conviction
of
her
have
hitherto
be
deaf
to
the
voice
of
love
;
and
this
piece
of
information
,
together
with
my
own
sentiment
in
his
favour
,
I
communicate
to
Don
Manuel
,
who
hear
these
tiding
with
transport
of
gratitude
and
joy
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
immediately
favour
with
opportunity
of
acquire
the
affection
of
my
daughter
,
and
his
endeavour
be
at
first
receive
with
such
respectful
civility
,
as
may
have
be
easily
warm
into
a
mutual
passion
,
have
not
the
evil
genius
of
our
family
interpose
.
    
<EOS>
o
my
friend
!
<EOS>
how
shall
I
describe
the
depravity
of
that
unhappy
virgin
's
sentiment
!
<EOS>
how
recount
the
particular
of
my
own
dishonour
!
 
<EOS>
I
that
be
descend
from
a
long
line
of
illustrious
Castilians
,
who
never
receive
an
injury
they
do
not
revenge
;
but
wash
away
every
blemish
in
their
fame
,
with
the
blood
of
those
who
attempt
to
stain
it
.
    
<EOS>
in
that
circumstance
,
I
have
imitate
the
example
of
my
glorious
progenitor
;
and
that
consideration
alone
,
hath
support
me
against
all
the
assault
of
despair
.
    
<EOS>
as
I
grudge
no
pain
and
expence
in
perfect
the
education
of
Serafina
,
my
door
be
open
to
every
person
who
make
an
extraordinary
figure
in
the
profession
of
those
amusing
science
,
in
which
she
delight
.
 
<EOS>
the
house
of
Don
Diego
de
Zelos
be
a
little
academy
for
painting
,
poetry
,
and
music

and
Heaven
decree
that
it
should
fall
a
sacrifice
to
its
regard
for
these
fatal
and
delusive
art

<EOS>
among
other

it
be
her
fate
to

traitor
,
who
,
like
you
,
have
lose
one
eye
<EOS>
,
I
not
only
admit
into
my
house
,
for
the
improvement
of
my
daughter
,
but
even
distinguished
with
particular
mark
of
confidence
and
favour
;
little
thinking
he
have
either
inclination
or
capacity
to
debauch
the
sentiment
of
my
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
rejoice
beyond
measure
,
to
see
with
what
alacrity
<EOS>
she
receive
his
lesson
,
with
what
avidity
she
listen
to
his
discourse
,
which
be
always
equally
moral
,
instruct
,
and
entertaining
.
    
<EOS>
Antonia
seem
to
vie
with
me
,
in
expression
of
regard
for
this
accomplished
stranger
,
whom
she
could
not
help
support
to
be
a
person
of
rank
and
family
,
reduce
to
his
present
situation
,
by
some
unfortunate
vicissitude
of
fate
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
dispose
to
concur
with
this
opinion
,
and
actually
conjure
him
to
make
me
his
confident
,
with
such
protestation
,
as
leave
him
no
room
to
doubt
my
honour
and
beneficence
;
but
he
still
persist
in
declare
himself
the
son
of
an
obscure
mechanic
in
Bohemia
;
an
origin
to
which
surely
no
man
would
pretend
,
who
have
the
least
claim
to
nobility
of
birth
.
 
<EOS>
while
I
be
thus
undeceived
in
my
conjecture
,
touch
his
birth
and
quality
<EOS>
,
I
be
confirm
in
an
opinion
of
his
integrity
and
moderation
,
and
look
upon
him
as
a
man
of
honour
,
in
despite
of
the
lowness
of
his
pedigree
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
he
be
at
bottom
,
a
most
perfidious
wretch
,
and
all
this
modesty
,
and
self
-
denial
be
the
effect
of
the
most
villainous
dissimulation
,
a
cloak
under
which
he
unsuspecte
rob
me
of
my
honour
and
my
peace
.
    
<EOS>
not
to
trouble
you
with
particular
,
the
recital
of
which
would
tear
my
heart
string
with
indignation
and
remorse
,
I
shall
only
observe
,
that
by
the
power
of
his
infernal
insinuation
,
he
fascinate
the
heart
of
Serafina
,
bring
over
Antonia
herself
to
the
interest
of
his
passion
,
and
at
once
detach
them
both
from
their
duty
and
religion
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
and
earth
!
<EOS>
how
dangerous
,
how
irresistible
be
the
power
of
infatuation
!
<EOS>
while
I
remain
in
the
midst
of
this
blind
security
,
wait
for
the
nuptial
of
my
daughter
,
and
indulge
myself
with
the
vain
prospect
of
her
approach
felicity
,
Antonia
find
mean
to
protract
the
negociation
of
the
marriage
,
by
represent
that
it
would
be
pity
to
deprive
Serafina
of
the
opportunity
she
then
have
of
profit
by
the
German
's
instruction
;
and
upon
that
account
,
I
prevail
upon
Don
Manuel
to
bridle
the
impatience
of
his
love
.
    
<EOS>
during
this
interval
,
as
I
one
evening
enjoy
the
cool
air
in
my
own
garden
,
I
be
accost
by
an
old
duenna
,
who
have
be
my
nurse
,
and
live
in
the
family
since
the
time
of
my
childhood
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
duty
,
say
she
,
will
no
longer
permit
me
to
wink
in
silence
,
at
the
wrong
<EOS>
I
see
you
daily
suffer
.
 
<EOS>
Dismiss
that
german
from
your
house
,
without
delay
,
if
you
respect
the
glory
of
your
name
,
and
the
right
of
our
holy
religion
:
the
stranger
be
an
abominable
heretic
;
and
,
grant
Heaven
!
<EOS>
he
may
not
have
already
poison
the
mind
of
those
you
hold
most
dear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
extremely
alarm
at
the
beginning
of
this
address
,
but
find
the
imputation
limit
to
the
article
of
religion
,
in
which
,
thank
God
,
I
be
no
bigot
,
I
recover
my
serenity
of
disposition
,
thank
the
old
woman
for
her
zeal
,
commend
her
piety
,
and
encourage
her
to
persevere
in
make
observation
on
such
subject
as
should
concern
my
honour
and
my
quiet
.
    
<EOS>
We
live
in
such
a
world
of
wickedness
and
fraud
,
that
a
man
can
not
be
too
vigilant
in
his
own
defence
:
have
I
employ
such
spy
from
the
beginning
,
I
should
,
in
all
probability
,
have
be
at
this
day
in
possession
of
every
comfort
that
render
life
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
the
duenna
,
thus
authorize
,
employ
her
sagacity
with
such
success
,
that
I
have
reason
to
suspect
the
german
of
a
design
upon
the
heart
of
Serafina
;
but
,
as
the
presumption
do
not
amount
to
conviction
,
I
content
myself
with
exile
him
from
my
house
,
under
the
pretext
of
have
discover
,
that
he
be
an
enemy
to
the
catholic
church
;
and
forthwith
appoint
a
day
for
the
celebration
of
my
daughter
's
marriage
,
with
Don
Manuel
de
Mendosa
.
    
<EOS>
I
could
easily
perceive
a
cloud
of
melancholy
overspread
the
face
of
Serafina
and
her
mother
,
when
I
declare
these
my
resolution
;
but
,
as
they
make
no
objection
to
what
I
propose
,
I
do
not
,
at
that
time
,
enter
into
an
explanation
of
the
true
motive
that
influence
my
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
both
party
be
,
probably
,
afraid
of
such
expostulation
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
preparation
be
make
for
the
spousal
of
Serafina
;
and
,
notwithstanding
the
anxiety
I
have
undergo
,
on
account
of
her
connexion
with
the
German
,
I
begin
to
think
that
her
duty
,
her
glory
,
have
triumph
over
all
such
low
-
bear
consideration
,
if
ever
they
have
be
entertain
;
because
she
and
even
Antonia
seem
to
expect
the
ceremony
with
resignation
,
though
the
feature
of
both
still
retain
evident
mark
of
concern
,
which
I
willingly
impute
to
the
mutual
prospect
of
their
separation
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
but
a
faithless
calm
,
that
soon
,
ah
!
<EOS>
too
soon
bring
forth
a
temp
,
which
hath
wreck
my
hope
.
    
<EOS>
two
day
before
the
appoint
union
of
Don
Manuel
and
Serafina
,
I
be
inform
by
the
duenna
,
that
while
she
accompany
Antonia
's
waiting
-
maid
at
church
,
she
have
see
her
receive
a
billet
from
an
old
woman
,
who
,
kneel
at
her
side
,
have
convey
it
in
such
a
mysterious
manner
,
as
waken
the
duenna
's
apprehension
about
her
young
lady
;
she
have
therefore
hasten
home
to
communicate
this
piece
of
intelligence
,
that
I
may
have
an
opportunity
of
examine
the
messenger
before
she
should
have
time
to
deposit
her
trust
.
    
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
shiver
with
fearful
presage
,
upon
this
occasion
,
and
even
abhor
the
person
to
whose
duty
and
zeal
<EOS>
I
be
behold
for
the
intelligence
,
even
while
I
endeavour
to
persuade
myself
,
that
the
inquiry
would
end
in
the
detection
of
some
paultry
intrigue
,
between
the
maid
and
her
own
gallant
<EOS>
,
I
intercept
her
in
return
from
church
,
and
command
her
to
follow
me
to
a
convenient
place
,
extort
from
her
,
by
dint
of
threat
,
the
fatal
letter
,
which
I
read
to
this
effect
.
    
<EOS>
"
the
whole
business
of
my
life
,
o
divine
Serafina
!
will
be
to
repay
that
affection
<EOS>
I
have
be
so
happy
as
to
engage
.
 
<EOS>
with
what
transport
then
shall
I
obey
your
summon
,
in
perform
that
enterprize
,
which
will
rescue
you
from
the
bed
of
a
detest
rival
,
and
put
myself
in
full
possession
of
a
jewel
,
which
I
value
infinitely
more
than
life
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
adorable
creature
<EOS>

I
have
provide
every
thing
for
our
escape
,
and
at
midnight
will
attend
you
in
your

from
whence
you
shall
be
convey
into
a
land
of
liberty

peace

where
you
will
unmoleste
enjoy
the
purity
of
that
religion
you
have
espouse

in
full
security
bless
the
arm

your

faithful
Orlando

"
    
<EOS>
be
you
a
fond
parent
,
a
tender
husband
and
a
noble
castilian
,
I
should
not
need
to
mention
the
unutterable
horror
that
take
possession
of
my
bosom
,
when
I
peruse
this
accurse
letter
,
by
which
I
learn
the
apostasy
,
disobedience
,
and
degeneracy
of
my
idolize
Serafina
,
who
have
overthrow
and
destroy
the
whole
plan
of
felicity
which
I
have
erect
,
and
blast
all
the
glory
of
my
name
;
and
when
the
wretched
messenger
,
terrify
by
my
menace
and
agitation
,
confess
that
Antonia
herself
be
privy
to
the
guilt
of
her
daughter
,
whom
she
have
solemnly
betroth
to
that
vile
German
,
in
the
sight
of
Heaven
,
and
that
by
her
connivance
,
this
Plebeian
intend
that
very
night
,
to
bereave
me
of
my
child
;
I
be
for
some
moment
stupifie
with
grief
and
amazement
,
that
give
way
to
an
extasy
of
rage
,
which
have
well
nigh
terminate
in
despair
and
distraction
.
    
<EOS>
I
now
tremble
,
and
my
head
grow
giddy
with
the
remembrance
of
that
dreadful
occasion
:
<EOS>
behold
how
the
drop
trickle
down
my
forehead
<EOS>
;
this
agony
be
a
fierce
and
familiar
visitant
,
I
shall
banish
it
anon
.
 
<EOS>
I
summon
my
pride
,
my
resentment
to
my
assistance
;
these
be
the
cordial
that
support
me
against
all
other
reflection
;
those
be
the
auxiliary
that
enable
me
in
the
day
of
trial
,
to
perform
that
sacrifice
which
my
honour
demand
,
in
a
strain
so
loud
,
as
to
drown
the
cry
of
nature
,
love
and
compassion
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
they
espouse
that
glory
,
which
humanity
would
have
betray
,
and
my
revenge
be
noble
,
though
unnatural
.
    
<EOS>
My
scheme
be
soon
lay
<EOS>
,
my
resolution
soon
take
;
I
privately
confine
the
wretch
who
have
be
the
industrious
slave
of
this
infamous
conspiracy
,
that
she
may
take
no
step
to
frustrate
,
or
interrupt
the
execution
of
my
design
.
    
<EOS>
then
repair
to
the
house
of
an
apothecary
,
who
be
devoted
to
my
service
,
communicate
my
intention
,
which
he
durst
not
condemn
,
and
could
not
reveal
,
without
break
the
oath
of
secrecy
I
have
impose
;
and
he
furnish
me
with
two
vial
of
poison
,
for
the
dismal
catastrophe
I
have
plan
.
 
<EOS>
thus
provide
,
I
on
pretence
of
sudden
business
at
Seville
,
carefully
avoid
the
dear
,
the
wretched
pair
,
whom
I
have
devote
to
death
,
that
my
heart
may
not
relent
,
by
mean
of
those
tender
idea
,
which
the
sight
of
them
would
have
infallibly
inspire
;
and
when
day
-
light
vanish
,
take
my
station
near
that
part
of
the
house
,
through
which
the
villain
must
have
enter
,
on
his
hellish
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
there
I
stand
in
a
state
of
horrid
expectation
,
my
soul
ravage
with
the
different
passion
that
assail
it
,
until
the
fatal
moment
arrive
;
when
I
perceive
the
traitor
approach
the
window
of
a
low
appartment
,
which
lead
into
that
of
Serafina
,
and
gently
lift
the
casement
,
which
be
purposely
leave
unsecured
,
insinuate
half
of
his
body
into
the
house
;
then
rush
upon
him
,
in
a
transport
of
fury
,
I
plunge
my
sword
into
his
heart
,
cry
"
Villain
!
<EOS>
receive
the
reward
of
thy
treachery
and
presumption

"
    
<EOS>
the
steel
be
so
well
aim
as
to
render
a
repetition
of
the
stroke
unnecessary
;
he
utter
one
groan
,
and
fall
breathless
at
my
foot
.
 
<EOS>
exult
with
this
first
success
of
my
revenge
,
I
penetrate
into
the
chamber
,
where
the
robber
of
my
peace
be
expect
by
the
unhappy
Serafina
and
her
mother
,
who
see
me
enter
with
a
most
savage
aspect
,
and
a
sword
reek
with
the
vengeance
I
have
take
,
seem
almost
petrified
with
fear
.
    
<EOS>
"
Behold
,
"
say
I
,
"
the
blood
of
that
base
plebeian
,
who
make
an
attempt
upon
the
honour

unfortunate

presumptuous
slave

the
favour
Orlando

<EOS>
Scarce
have
I
pronounce
these
word
,
when
a
loud
scream
be
pronounce
by
both
the
unhappy
victim
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
Orlando
be
slay
,
cry
the
infatuated
Serafina
,
what
have
I
to
do
with
life
?
 
<EOS>
o
my

lord

<EOS>
my

here
strike

compleat
your
barbarous
sacrifice

spirit

murder

<EOS>
these
frantic
exclamation
,
in
which
she
be
join
by
Antonia
,
keep
up
the
fury
of
my
resentment
,
which
by
meekness
and
submission
may
have
be
weaken
and
render
ineffectual
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes

hapless
wretch

I
reply
,
"
ye
shall
enjoy
your
wish

<EOS>
the
honour

shall
die

yet
I
will
not
mangle
the
breast
of
Antonia

on
which
I
have
so
often
repose

I
will
not
shed
the
blood
of
Zelos

nor
disfigure
the
beauteous
form
of
Serafina

on
which
I
have
so
often
gaze
with
wonder

unspeakable
delight

here
be
an
elixir
,
to
which
I
trust
the
consummation
of
my
revenge

"
    
<EOS>
so
say
,
I
empty
the
vial
into
separate
cup
,
and
present
one
in
each
hand
,
the
miserable
,
the
fair
offender
,
instantly
receive
the
destine
draught
,
which
they
drink
without
hesitation
:
then
pray
to
Heaven
for
the
wretched
Don
Diego
,
sink
upon
the
same
couch
,
and
expire
without
a
groan

<EOS>
o
well

<EOS>
o
happy
composition

by
which
all
the
misery

<EOS>
Such
be
the
fate
of
Antonia

these
hand
be
the
instrument
that
deprive
them
of
life
,
these
eye

the
rich
prize
that
death
have
ever
win

<EOS>
Powers
supreme
!
<EOS>
do
Don
Diego
live
to
make
this
recapitulation
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
do
my
duty
;
but
ah
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
haunt
by
the
fury
of
remorse
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
torture
with
the
incessant
sting
of
remembrance
and
regret
;
even
now
the
image
of
my
wife

present
themselves
to
my
imagination

<EOS>
all
the
scene
of
happiness
I
have
enjoy
as
a

husband

<EOS>
all
the
endearing
hope
I
have
cherish
,
now
pass
in
review
before
me

embitter
the
circumstance
of
my
inexpressible
woe

and
I
consider
myself
as
a
solitary
outcast
from
all
the
comfort
of
society

<EOS>
but
,
enough
of
these
unmanly
complaint
,
the
yearning
of
nature
be
too
importunate

<EOS>
have
compleate
my
vengeance
,
I
retire
into
my
closet
,
and
furnish
myself
with
some
ready
money
and
jewel
of
considerable
value
,
go
into
the
stable
,
saddle
my
favourite
steed
,
which
I
instantly
mount
,
and
before
the
tumult
of
my
breast
subside
,
find
myself
at
the
town
of
St
Lucar
.
 
<EOS>
there
I
learn
from
inquiry
,
that
there
be
a
dutch
bark
in
the
harbour
ready
to
sail
;
upon
which
,
I
address
myself
to
the
master
,
who
for
a
suitable
gratification
,
be
prevail
upon
to
weigh
anchor
that
same
night
;
so
that
embark
without
delay
,
I
soon
bid
eternal
adieu
to
my
native
country
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
not
from
reason
and
reflection
,
that
I
take
these
measure
for
my
personal
safety
;
but
in
consequence
of
an
involuntary
instinct
,
that
seem
to
operate
in
the
animal
machine
,
while
the
faculty
of
thinking
be
suspend
.
    
<EOS>
to
<EOS>
what
a
dreadful
reckoning
be
I
call
,
when
reason
resume
her
function
!
<EOS>
you
may
believe
me
,
my
friend
,
when
I
assure
you
,
that
I
should
not
have
out
-
live
those
tragedy
I
act
,
have
I
not
be
restrain
from
do
violence
upon
myself
,
by
certain
consideration
,
which
no
man
of
honour
ought
to
set
aside
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
fall
ingloriously
by
the
hand
of
an
executioner
,
and
intaile
disgrace
upon
a
family
that
know
no
stain
;
and
I
be
deter
from
put
an
end
to
my
own
misery
,
by
the
apprehension
of
posthumous
censure
,
which
would
have
represent
me
as
a
desponding
wretch
,
utterly
destitute
of
that
patience
,
fortitude
and
resignation
,
which
be
the
characteristic
of
a
true
Castilian
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
also
influence
by
religious
motive
,
that
suggest
to
me
the
necessity
of
live
to
attone
by
my
suffering
and
sorrow
,
for
the
guilt
I
have
incur
,
in
comply
with
a
savage
punctilio
,
which
be
,
I
fear
,
displease
in
the
sight
of
Heaven
.
    
<EOS>
these
be
the
reason
that
oppose
my
entrance
into
that
peaceful
harbour
,
which
death
present
to
my
view
;
and
they
be
soon
reinforce
by
another
principle
,
that
sanction
my
determination
,
to
continue
at
the
servile
oar
of
life
.
    
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
unfavourable
wind
,
our
vessel
for
some
day
make
small
progress
in
her
voyage
to
Holland
,
and
near
the
coast
of
Gallicia
we
be
join
by
an
english
ship
from
Vigo
,
the
master
of
which
give
us
to
understand
,
that
before
he
set
sail
,
a
courier
have
arrive
from
Madrid
,
at
that
place
,
with
order
for
the
corregidor
,
to
prevent
the
escape
of
any
native
Spaniard
,
by
sea
,
from
any
port
within
his
district
;
and
to
use
his
utmost
endeavour
to
apprehend
the
person
of
Don
Diego
de
Zelos
,
who
be
suspect
of
treasonable
practice
against
the
state
.
 
<EOS>
such
an
order
,
with
a
minute
description
of
my
person
,
be
,
at
the
same
time
,
dispatch
to
all
the
sea
port
and
frontier
place
in
Spain
.
    
<EOS>
You
may
easily
suppose
how
I
,
who
be
already
overwhelm
with
distress
,
could
bear
this
aggravation
of
misfortune
and
disgrace
:
 
I
,
who
have
always
maintain
the
reputation
of
loyalty
,
which
be
acquire
at
the
hazard
of
my
life
,
and
the
expence
of
my
blood
.
 
<EOS>
to
deal
candidly
,
I
must
own
,
that
this
intelligence
rouse
me
from
a
lethargy
of
grief
,
which
have
begin
to
overpower
my
faculty
.
 
<EOS>
I
immediately
impute
this
dishonourable
charge
to
the
evil
office
of
some
villain
,
who
have
basely
take
the
advantage
of
my
deplorable
situation
,
and
I
be
inflame
,
inspirit
with
the
desire
of
vindicate
my
fame
;
and
revenge
the
injury
.
 
<EOS>
thus
animate
,
I
resolve
to
disguise
myself
effectually
from
the
observation
of
those
spy
,
which
every
nation
find
its
account
in
employ
,
in
foreign
country
;
I
purchase
this
habit
from
the
dutch
navigator
,
in
whose
house
I
keep
myself
conceal
,
after
our
arrival
at
Amsterdam
,
until
my
beard
be
grow
to
a
sufficient
length
to
favour
my
design
,
and
then
appear
as
a
persian
dealer
in
jewel
.
    
<EOS>
as
I
could
gain
no
satisfactory
information
touch
myself
,
in
this
country
,
have
no
purpose
to
pursue
,
and
be
extremely
miserable
among
a
people
,
who
be
mercenary
and
unsocial
,
be
very
ill
adapt
to
alleviate
the
horror
of
my
condition
;
I
gratify
my
landlord
for
his
important
service
,
with
the
good
part
of
my
effect
;
and
have
,
by
his
mean
,
procure
a
certificate
from
the
magistracy
,
repair
to
Rotterdam
,
from
whence
<EOS>
I
set
out
in
a
travel
carriage
for
Antwerp
,
on
my
way
to
this
capital
;
hope
,
with
a
succession
of
different
object
,
to
mitigate
the
anguish
of
my
mind
,
and
by
the
most
industrious
inquiry
,
to
learn
such
particular
of
that
false
impeachment
,
as
would
enable
me
to
take
measure
for
my
own
justification
,
as
well
as
for
project
a
plan
of
revenge
against
the
vile
perfidious
author
.
    
<EOS>
this
,
I
imagine
,
would
be
no
difficult
task
,
consider
the
friendship
and
intercourse
subsist
between
the
spanish
and
french
nation
,
and
the
communicative
disposition
,
for
which
the
Parisians
be
renowned
;
but
I
have
find
myself
egregiously
deceive
in
my
expectation
:
the
officer
of
the
Police
in
this
city
be
so
inquisitive
and
vigilant
,
that
the
most
minute
action
of
a
stranger
be
scrutinize
with
great
severity
;
and
although
the
inhabitant
be
very
frank
in
discourse
on
indifferent
subject
,
they
be
at
the
same
time
extremely
cautious
in
avoid
all
conversation
that
turn
upon
state
occurrence
and
maxim
of
government
.
    
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
the
peculiarity
of
my
appearance
,
subject
me
so
much
to
particular
observation
,
that
I
have
hitherto
think
proper
to
devour
my
griefs
in
silence
,
and
even
to
bear
the
want
of
almost
every
convenience
,
rather
than
hazard
a
premature
discovery
,
by
offer
my
jewel
to
sale
.
    
<EOS>
in
this
emergency
,
I
have
be
so
far
fortunate
as
to
become
acquainted
with
you
,
whom
I
look
upon
as
a
man
of
honour
and
humanity
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
be
,
at
first
sight
,
prepossess
in
your
favour
:
for
notwithstanding
the
mistake
which
man
daily
commit
in
judge
from
appearance
,
there
be
something
in
the
physiognomy
of
a
stranger
,
from
which
one
can
not
help
form
an
opinion
of
his
character
and
disposition
.
 
<EOS>
for
once
,
my
penetration
hath
not
fail
me
;
your
behaviour
justify
my
decision
;
you
have
treat
me
with
that
sympathy
and
respect
<EOS>
which
none
but
the
generous
will
pay
to
the
unfortunate
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
trust
you
accordingly
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
put
my
life
,
my
honour
in
your
power
:
and
I
must
beg
leave
to
depend
upon
your
friendship
,
for
obtain
that
satisfaction
,
for
which
alone
I
seek
to
live
.
 
<EOS>
Your
employment
engage
you
in
the
gay
world
:
you
daily
mingle
with
the
society
of
man
;
the
domestic
of
the
spanish
ambassador
will
not
shun
your
acquaintance
;
you
may
frequent
in
the
coffee
-
house
to
which
they
resort
;
and
in
the
course
of
these
occasion
,
unsuspected
inform
yourself
of
that
mysterious
charge
which
lie
heavy
on
the
fame
of
the
unfortunate
Don
Diego
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
likewise
,
implore
your
assistance
in
convert
my
jewel
into
money
,
that
I
may
breathe
independent
of
man
,
until
Heaven
shall
permit
me
to
finish
this
weary
pilgrimage
of
life
.
     
<EOS>
a
flagrant
instance
of
Fathom
's
virtue
,
in
the
manner
of
his
retreat
to
England
.
   
<EOS>
Fathom
,
who
have
lend
an
attentive
ear
to
every
circumstance
of
this
disastrous
story
,
no
sooner
hear
it
conclude
,
than
with
an
aspect
of
generous
and
cordial
compassion
,
not
even
unattende
with
tear
,
he
condole
the
lamentable
fate
of
Don
Diego
de
Zelos
;
deplore
the
untimely
death
of
the
gentle
Antonia
and
the
fair
Serafina
,
and
undertake
the
interest
of
the
wretched
Castilian
with
such
warmth
of
sympathize
zeal
,
as
draw
a
flood
from
his
eye
,
while
he
wring
his
benefactor
's
hand
in
a
transport
of
gratitude
.
 
<EOS>
those
be
literally
tear
of
joy
,
or
at
least
of
satisfaction
on
both
side
;
as
our
hero
weep
with
affection
and
attachment
to
the
jewel
that
be
to
be
commit
to
his
care
;
but
,
far
from
discover
the
true
source
of
his
tenderness
,
he
affect
to
dissuade
the
Spaniard
from
part
with
the
diamond
,
which
he
counsel
him
to
reserve
for
a
more
pressing
occasion
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
earnestly
intreate
him
to
depend
upon
his
friendship
,
for
present
relief
.
 
<EOS>
this
generous
proffer
serve
only
to
confirm
Don
Diego
's
resolution
,
which
he
forthwith
execute
,
by
put
into
the
hand
of
Ferdinand
,
jewel
to
the
value
of
a
thousand
crown
,
and
desire
him
to
detain
,
for
his
own
use
,
any
part
of
the
sum
they
would
raise
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
thank
him
for
the
good
opinion
he
entertain
of
his
integrity
,
an
opinion
fully
manifest
in
honour
him
with
such
important
confidence
;
and
assure
him
he
would
transact
his
affair
with
the
utmost
diligence
,
caution
and
dispatch
.
 
<EOS>
the
evening
be
by
this
time
almost
consume
,
these
new
ally
retire
separately
to
rest
:
though
each
pass
the
night
without
repose
,
in
very
different
reflection
;
the
Castilian
being
,
as
usual
,
agitate
with
the
uncease
pang
of
his
unalterable
misery
,
intersperse
with
gleam
hope
of
revenge
:
and
Fathom
be
keep
awake
with
revolving
plan
,
for
turn
his
fellow
-
lodger
's
credulity
to
his
own
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
nature
of
the
Spaniard
's
situation
,
he
may
have
appropriate
the
jewel
to
himself
,
and
remain
in
Paris
,
without
fear
of
a
prosecution
,
because
the
injure
party
have
,
by
the
above
narrative
,
leave
his
life
and
liberty
at
discretion
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
think
himself
secure
from
the
personal
resentment
of
an
enraged
desperate
castilian
;
and
therefore
determine
to
withdraw
himself
privately
into
that
country
,
where
he
have
all
along
propose
to
fix
the
standard
of
his
finesse
,
which
fortune
have
now
impowere
him
to
exercise
accord
to
his
wish
.
    
<EOS>
Bent
upon
this
retreat
,
he
go
abroad
in
the
morning
,
on
pretence
of
act
in
the
concern
of
his
friend
Don
Diego
,
and
have
hire
a
post
-
chaise
to
be
ready
at
the
dawn
of
next
day
,
return
to
his
lodging
,
where
he
cajole
the
Spaniard
with
a
feign
report
of
his
negotiation
:
then
secure
his
most
valuable
effect
about
his
person
,
arise
with
the
cock
,
repair
to
the
place
at
which
he
have
appoint
to
meet
the
postilion
with
the
carriage
,
and
set
out
for
England
without
further
delay
;
leave
the
unhappy
Zelos
to
the
horror
of
indigence
,
and
the
additional
agony
of
this
fresh
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
yet
he
be
not
the
only
person
affect
by
the
abrupt
departure
of
Fathom
,
which
be
hasten
by
the
importunity
,
threat
and
reproach
of
his
landlord
's
daughter
,
whom
he
have
debauch
under
promise
of
marriage
,
and
now
leave
in
the
fourth
month
of
her
pregnancy
.
    
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
dangerous
adventure
in
which
he
have
be
formerly
involve
by
travel
in
the
night
,
he
do
not
think
proper
to
make
the
usual
halt
on
this
journey
for
sleep
or
refreshment
,
nor
do
he
once
quit
the
chaise
,
till
his
arrival
at
Bologne
,
which
he
reach
in
twenty
hour
,
after
his
departure
from
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
here
he
think
he
may
safely
indulge
himself
with
a
comfortable
meal
;
accordingly
,
he
bespeak
a
poulard
for
dinner
,
and
while
that
be
prepare
,
go
forth
to
view
the
city
and
harbour
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
behold
the
white
cliff
of
Albion
,
his
heart
throb
with
all
the
joy
of
a
beloved
son
,
who
after
a
tedious
and
fatiguing
voyage
,
review
the
chimney
of
his
father
's
house
:
he
survey
the
neighbouring
coast
of
England
,
with
fond
and
longing
eye
,
like
another
Moses
reconnoitre
the
land
of
Canaan
from
the
top
of
mount
Pisgah
:
and
to
such
a
degree
of
impatience
<EOS>
be
he
enflame
by
the
sight
,
that
instead
of
proceed
to
Calais
,
he
resolve
to
take
his
passage
directly
from
Boulogne
,
even
if
he
should
hire
a
vessel
for
the
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
with
these
sentiment
,
he
inquire
if
there
be
any
ship
bind
for
England
,
and
be
so
fortunate
as
to
find
the
master
of
a
small
bark
,
who
intend
to
weigh
anchor
for
Deal
,
that
same
evening
at
high
water
.
    
<EOS>
transport
with
this
information
,
he
immediately
agree
for
his
passage
,
sell
the
post
-
chaise
to
his
landlord
for
thirty
guinea
,
as
a
piece
of
furniture
,
for
which
he
could
have
no
further
use
,
purchase
a
portmanteau
,
together
with
some
linen
and
wear
apparel
,
and
at
the
recommendation
of
his
host
,
take
into
his
service
,
an
extra
postilion
or
helper
,
who
have
formerly
wear
the
livery
of
a
travel
marquis
.
 
<EOS>
this
new
domestic
,
whose
name
be
Maurice
,
underwent
,
with
great
applause
,
<EOS>
the
examination
of
our
hero
,
who
perceive
in
him
,
a
fund
of
sagacity
and
presence
of
mind
,
by
which
he
be
excellently
qualified
for
be
the
valet
of
an
adventurer
<EOS>
;
he
be
therefore
accommodate
with
a
second
hand
suit
,
and
another
shirt
,
and
at
once
list
under
the
banner
of
Count
Fathom
,
who
spend
the
whole
afternoon
in
give
him
proper
instruction
for
the
regulation
of
his
conduct
.
    
<EOS>
have
settle
these
preliminary
to
his
own
satisfaction
,
he
and
his
baggage
be
embark
about
six
o'clock
in
the
month
of
September
,
and
it
be
not
without
emotion
,
that
he
find
himself
benight
upon
the
great
deep
,
of
which
,
before
the
preceede
day
,
he
have
never
enjoy
even
the
most
distant
prospect
.
    
<EOS>
however
,
he
be
not
a
man
to
be
afraid
,
where
there
be
really
no
appearance
of
danger
;
and
the
agreeable
presage
of
future
fortune
support
his
spirit
,
amidst
the
disagreeable
nausea
which
commonly
attend
landman
at
sea
,
until
he
be
set
ashore
upon
the
beach
at
Deal
,
which
he
enter
in
good
health
about
seven
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
    
<EOS>
like
Caesar
,
however
,
he
find
some
difficulty
in
landing
,
on
account
of
the
swell
surf
,
that
tumble
about
with
such
violence
,
as
have
almost
overset
the
cutter
that
carry
him
on
shore
;
and
in
his
eagerness
to
jump
upon
the
strand
,
his
foot

the
first
part

him
that

<EOS>
upon
this
occasion

he
,
in
imitation
of
Scipio

behaviour
on
the
coast
of
Afric

hail
the

and
grasp
an
handful
of
the

exclaim
in
the
italian
language

"

old

as

he
congratulate
himself
upon
his
happy
voyage

and
the
peaceable
possession
of
his
spoil

and
could
not
help
snuff
up
the
british
air
with
mark
of
infinite
relish
and
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
His
first
care
be
to
recompence
himself
for
the
want
of
sleep
he
have
undergo
,
and
after
he
have
sufficiently
recruit
himself
with
several
hour
of
uninterrupted
repose
,
he
set
out
in
a
post
-
chaise
for
Canterbury
,
where
he
take
a
place
in
the
London
stage
,
which
,
he
be
tell
,
would
depart
next
morning
,
the
coach
be
already
full
.
    
<EOS>
on
this
very
first
day
of
his
arrival
,
he
perceive
between
the
English
and
the
people
among
whom
he
have
hitherto
<EOS>
live
,
such
essential
difference
in
customs
,
appearance
,
and
way
of
living
,
as
inspire
him
with
high
notion
of
that
british
freedom
,
opulence
,
and
convenience
on
which
he
have
often
hear
his
mother
expatiate
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
road
,
he
feast
his
eye
sight
with
the
verdant
hill
cover
with
flock
of
sheep
,
the
fruitful
vale
parcel
out
into
cultivated
inclosure
;
the
very
cattle
seem
to
profit
by
the
wealth
of
their
master
,
be
large
,
sturdy
and
sleek
,
and
every
peasant
breathe
the
insolence
of
liberty
and
independance
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
he
view
the
wide
extended
plain
of
Kent
,
with
a
lover
's
eye
,
and
his
ambition
become
romantic
,
could
not
help
fancy
himself
another
conqueror
of
the
isle

He
be
not

long
amuse
by
these
vain
chimera

vanish
before
other
reflection
of
more
importance

<EOS>
His
imagination
,
it
must
be
own
,
be
at
all
time
too
chaste
,
to
admit
those
over

weene
hope
,
which
often
mislead
the
mind
of
a
projector
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
study
mankind
with
incredible
diligence
,
and
know
perfectly
well
how
far
he
could
depend
on
the
passion
and
foible
of
human
nature
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
may
now
act
consistent
with
his
former
sagacity
<EOS>
,
he
resolve
to
pass
himself
upon
his
fellow
traveller
,
for
a
french
gentleman
,
equally
a
stranger
to
the
language
and
country
of
England
,
in
order
to
glean
from
their
discourse

such
intelligence
as
may
avail

with
that
politeness
which
be

to
this
happy

fix
themselves
in
the
vehicle
,
in
such
a
manner
,
before
he
have
the
least
intimation
of
their
design
,
that
he
find
it
barely
practicable
to
insinuate
himself
sidelong
between
a
corpulent
quaker
,
and
a
fat
Wapping

landlady
,
in
which
attitude
he
stick
fast
,
like
a
thin

as

the
pain

such
compression

be
not
sufficient
matter
of
chagrin

the
great
part
of
the

themselves
with
laugh
at
his
ludicrous

the
jolly

at
his

observe
with
a
loud
exclamation
of
mirth
,
that
Monsieur

be
soon
better
acquaint
with
a
buttock
of
english
beef
;
and
say
by
that

great

he
may
have
accost
them

success

there

this

jealous

it

highly
probable

not

with
this

the
experienced
spoiler
proceed
to
search
his
baggage
,
and
perceive
a
false
bottom
in
his

beneath
it
a
valuable

the
plunder

<EOS>
the
singular
manner
of
Fathom

attack
and
triumph
over
the
virtue
of
the
fair
Elenor

by
which

who

the
justice
,
and
his
lordship
in
particular
,
for
the
candour
and
hospitality
with
which
he
have
be
treat
,
and
resume
his
place
in
the
vehicle
,
amidst
the
congratulation
of
all
his
fellow
traveller
,
except
the
two
forlorn
smuggler
,
who
instead
of
reimbarke
in
the
coach
,
think
proper
to
remain
at
the
inn
,
with
a
view
to
mitigate
,
if
possible
,
the
severity
of
their
misfortune
.
    
<EOS>
among
those
who
felicitate
Fathom
upon
the
issue
of
this
adventure
,
the
young
maiden
seem
to
express
the
most
sensible
pleasure
at
that
event
.
 
<EOS>
the
artful
language
of
his
eye
have
raise
in
her
breast
certain
flattering
emotion
,
before
she
know
the
value
of
her
conquest
;
but
now
that
his
rank
and
condition
be
discover
,
these
transport
be
increase
by
the
idea
of
vanity
and
ambition
which
be
mingle
with
the
first
seed
of
every
female
constitution
.
    
<EOS>
the
belief
of
have
captivate
the
heart
of
a
man
who
could
raise
her
to
the
rank
and
dignity
of
a
countess
,
produce
such
agreeable
sensation
in
her
fancy
,
that
her
eye
shine
with
unusual
lustre
,
and
a
continual
smile
play
in
dimple
,
on
her
rosy
cheek
;
so
that
her
attraction
,
though
not
powerful
enough
to
engage
the
affection
,
be
yet
sufficient
to
inflame
the
desire
of
our
adventurer
,
who
very
honestly
mark
her
chastity
for
prey
to
his
voluptuous
passion
.
 
<EOS>
have
she
be
well
season
with
knowledge
and
experience
,
and
compleatly
arm
with
caution
against
the
artifice
and
villainy
of
man
,
her
virtue
may
not
have
be
able
to
withstand
the
engine
of
such
an
assailant
,
consider
the
dangerous
opportunity
to
which
she
be
necessarily
expose
:
how
easy
then
must
his
victory
have
be
over
an
innocent
,
unsuspecting
country
damsel
,
flush
with
the
warmth
of
youth
,
and
an
utter
stranger
to
the
way
of
life
.
    
<EOS>
while
Obadiah
,
therefore
,
and
his
plump
companion
be
engage
in
conversation
,
on
the
strange
incident
which
have
pass
,
Fathom
act
a
very
expressive
pantomime
with
this
fair
buxom
nymph
,
who
comprehend
his
meanig
with
surprizing
facility
,
and
be
at
so
little
pain
to
conceal
the
pleasure
she
take
in
this
kind
of
intercourse
,
that
several
warm
squeeze
be
interchange
between
her
and
her
lover
,
before
they
arrive
at
Rochester
,
where
they
propose
to
dine
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
during
this
period
,
he
learn
from
the
answer
she
make
to
the
inquisitive
quaker
,
that
her
sole
dependance
be
upon
a
relation
,
to
whom
she
have
a
letter
,
and
that
she
be
a
perfect
stranger
in
the
great
city
;
circumstance
on
which
he
soon
form
the
project
of
her
ruin
.
    
<EOS>
upon
their
arrival
at
the
Black
Bull
,
he
for
the
first
time
find
himself
alone
with
his
Amanda
,
whose
name
be
Elenor
,
their
fellow
-
traveller
be
elsewhere
employ
about
their
own
concern
;
and
unwilling
to
lose
the
precious
opportunity
,
he
begin
to
act
the
part
of
a
very
importunate
lover
,
which
he
conceive
to
be
a
proper
sequel
to
the
prelude
,
which
have
be
perform
in
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
the
freedom
that
she
,
out
of
pure
simplicity
and
good
humour
,
permit
him
to
take
with
her
hand
,
and
even
her
rosy
lip
,
encourage
him
to
practise
other
familiarity
upon
her
fair
bosom
,
which
scandalize
her
virtue
so
much
,
that
in
spite
of
the
passion
she
have
begin
to
indulge
in
his
behalf
,
she
reject
his
advance
with
all
the
mark
of
anger
and
disdain
;
and
he
find
it
necessary
to
appease
the
storm
he
have
raise
,
by
the
most
respectful
and
submissive
demeanour
;
resolve
to
change
his
operation
,
and
carry
on
his
attack
,
so
as
to
make
her
yield
at
discretion
,
without
alarm
her
religion
or
pride
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
when
the
bill
be
call
after
dinner
,
he
take
particular
notice
of
her
behaviour
,
and
peceive
her
pull
out
a
large
leathern
purse
that
contain
her
money
,
reconnoitre
the
pocket
in
which
it
be
deposit
,
and
while
they
sit
close
to
each
other
in
the
carriage
,
convey
it
with
admirable
dexterity
into
an
hole
in
the
cushion
.
 
<EOS>
whether
the
corpulent
couple
,
who
sit
opposite
to
these
lover
;
have
enter
into
an
amorous
engagement
at
the
inn
,
or
be
severally
induce
by
other
motive
,
be
uncertain
;
but
,
sure
it
be
,
both
leave
the
coach
on
that
part
of
the
road
which
lie
near
to
gravesend
,
and
bad
adieu
to
the
other
pair
,
on
pretence
of
have
urgent
business
at
that
place
.
    
<EOS>
Ferdinand
,
not
a
little
pleased
at
their
departure
,
renew
his
most
pathetic
expression
of
love
,
and
sing
several
french
song
on
that
tender
subject
,
which
seem
to
thrill
to
the
soul
of
his
beauteous
Helen
.
 
<EOS>
while
the
driver
halt
at
Dartford
to
water
his
horse
,
she
be
smit
with
the
appearance
of
some
cheesecake
,
which
be
present
by
the
landlady
of
the
house
,
and
have
bargain
for
two
or
three
,
put
her
hand
in
her
pocket
,
in
order
to
pay
for
her
purchase
;
but
what
be
her
astonishment
,
when
after
have
rummage
her
equipage
,
she
understand
her
whole
fortune
be
lose
!
 
<EOS>
this
mishap
be
by
a
loud
shriek
announce
to
our
hero
,
who
affect
infinite
amazement
and
concern
;
and
no
sooner
learn
the
cause
of
her
affliction
,
than
he
present
her
with
his
own
purse
,
from
which
he
,
in
emphatic
dumb
shew
,
beg
she
would
indemnify
herself
for
the
damage
she
have
sustain
.
 
<EOS>
although
this
kind
proffer
be
some
alleviation
of
her
misfortune
,
she
do
not
fail
to
pour
forth
a
most
piteous
lamentation
,
import
that
she
have
not
only
lose
all
her
money
,
amount
to
five
pound
,
but
also
her
letter
of
recommendation
upon
which
she
have
altogether
rely
for
present
employment
.
    
<EOS>
the
vehicle
be
minutely
search
from
top
to
bottom
,
by
herself
and
our
adventurer
,
assist
by
Maurice
,
and
the
coachman
,
who
find
their
inquiry
ineffectual
,
do
not
scruple
to
declare
his
suspicion
of
the
two
fat
turtle
who
have
desert
the
coach
in
such
an
abrupt
manner
.
    
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
he
render
this
conjecture
so
plausible
,
by
wrest
the
circumstance
of
their
behaviour
and
retreat
,
that
poor
Elenor
implicitly
believe
they
be
the
thief
by
whom
she
have
suffer
;
and
be
prevail
upon
to
accept
the
proffer
assistance
of
the
generous
count
,
who
see
her
very
much
disorder
by
this
mischance
,
insist
upon
her
drink
a
large
glass
of
Canary
to
quiet
the
perturbation
of
her
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
season
,
which
of
all
other
,
be
most
propitious
to
the
attempt
of
an
artful
lover
;
and
justify
the
metaphorical
maxim
of
fish
in
troubled
water
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
affinity
and
short
transition
betwixt
all
the
violent
passion
that
agitate
the
human
mind
<EOS>
:
they
be
all
false
perspective
,
which
though
they
magnify
,
yet
perplex
and
render
indistinct
<EOS>
every
object
which
they
represent
:
and
flattery
be
never
so
successfully
administre
,
as
to
those
who
know
they
stand
in
need
of
friendship
,
assent
,
and
approbation
.
    
<EOS>
the
cordial
she
swallow
,
far
from
calm
,
increase
the
disturbance
of
her
thought
,
and
produce
an
intoxication
;
during
which
,
she
talk
in
an
incoherent
strain
,
laugh
and
weep
by
turn
,
and
act
other
extravagancy
,
which
be
know
to
be
symptom
of
the
hysterical
affection
.
 
<EOS>
Fathom
,
though
an
utter
stranger
to
the
sentiment
of
honour
,
pity
and
remorse
,
would
not
perpetrate
his
vitious
purpose
,
though
favour
by
the
delirium
his
villainy
have
intaile
upon
this
unfortunate
young
maiden
;
because
his
appetite
demand
a
more
perfect
sacrifice
,
than
that
which
she
could
yield
in
her
present
deplorable
situation
,
when
her
will
must
have
be
altogether
unconcerned
in
his
success
.
    
<EOS>
determine
therefore
,
to
make
a
conquest
of
her
virtue
,
before
he
would
take
possession
of
her
person
,
he
mimic
that
compassion
and
benevolence
,
which
his
heart
have
never
feel
,
and
when
the
coach
arrive
at
London
,
not
only
discharge
what
she
owe
for
her
place
,
but
likewise
procure
for
her
an
apartment
in
the
house
,
to
which
he
himself
have
be
direct
for
lodging
,
and
even
hire
a
nurse
to
attend
her
during
a
severe
fever
,
which
be
the
consequence
of
her
disappointment
and
despondence
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
she
be
supply
with
all
necessary
by
the
generosity
of
this
noble
count
,
who
for
the
interest
of
his
passion
,
and
the
honour
of
his
name
,
be
resolve
to
extend
his
charity
to
the
last
farthing
of
her
own
money
,
which
he
have
be
wise
enough
to
secure
for
this
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
Her
youth
soon
get
the
well
of
her
distemper
,
and
when
she
understand
her
obligation
to
the
count
,
who
do
not
fail
to
attend
her
in
person
with
great
tenderness
,
her
heart
,
which
have
be
before
prepossess
in
his
favour
,
now
glow
with
all
the
warmth
of
gratitude
,
esteem
and
affection
.
    
<EOS>
She
know
herself
in
a
strange
place
,
destitute
of
all
resource
but
in
his
generosity
:
<EOS>
she
love
his
person
,
she
be
dazle
by
his
rank
;
and
he
know
so
well
how
to
improve
the
opportunity
and
advantage
he
derive
from
her
unhappy
situation
,
that
he
gradually
proceed
in
sap
from
one
degree
of
intimacy
to
another
,
until
all
the
bulwark
of
her
chastity
be
undermine
,
and
she
submit
to
his
desire
;
not
with
the
reluctance
of
a
vanquished
people
,
but
with
all
the
transport
of
a
joyful
city
,
that
open
its
gate
to
receive
a
darling
prince
,
return
from
conquest
;
for
,
by
this
time
,
he
have
artfully
concentre
and
kindle
up
,
all
the
inflammable
ingredient
of
her
constitution
;
and
she
now
look
back
upon
the
virtuous
principle
of
her
education
,
as
upon
a
disagreeable
and
tedious
dream
,
from
which
she
have
wake
to
the
fruition
of
never

fade
joy
.

He
by
accident
encounter
his
old

with

<EOS>
Our
hero
have
thus
provide
himself
with
a
proper
subject
for
his
hour
of
dalliance
,
think
it
be
now
high
time
to
study
the
ground
which
he
have
pitch
upon
for
the
scene
of
his
exploit

with
that

make
several
excursion
to
different
part
of
the
town

where
there
be
ought
of
entertainment
or
instruction
to

yet
he
always
,
on
these
occasion
,
appear
in
an
obscure
ordinary
dress
,
in
order
to
avoid
singularity
,
and
never
go
twice
to
the

coffee
 
house

that
his
person
may
not

in

"
Mr
Fathom
,
by
your
frank
and
obliging
manner
of
treat
a
man
who
hath
do
you
wrong
,
I
be
more
and
more
confirmed
in
my
opinion
of
your
sagacity
,
which
I
have
often
consider
with
admiration
:
 
I
will
not
therefore
attempt
to
make
an
apology
for
my
conduct
at
our
last
parting
;
but
only
assure
you
that
this
meeting
may
turn
out
to
our
mutual
advantage
,
if
we
now
re
-
enter
into
an
unreserved
union
,
the
tie
of
which
we
will
soon
find
it
our
interest
and
inclination
to
preserve
.
 
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
as
my
judgment
be
ripen
by
experience
,
so
be
my
sentiment
change
since
our
last
association
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
many
a
rich
harvest
lose
,
for
want
of
a
fellow
labourer
in
the
vineyard
;
and
I
have
more
than
once
fall
a
sacrifice
to
a
combination
,
which
I
could
have
resist
with
the
help
of
one
able
auxiliary
.
    
<EOS>
indeed
I
may
prove
what
I
alledge
by
mathematical
demonstration
;
and
I
believe
no
body
will
pretend
to
deny
,
that
two
head
be
well
than
one
,
in
all
case
that
require
discernment
and
deliberation

<EOS>
Ferdinand
could
not
help
own
the
sanity
of
his
observation
,

forthwith
acquiesce
in
his
proposal
of
the
new
alliance
;
desire
to
know
the
character
in
which
he
act
in
the
english
stage
,
and
the
scheme
he
would
offer
for
their
mutual
emolument
:
at
the
same
time
he
resolve
within
himself
,
to
keep
such
a
strict
eye
over
his
future
action
,
as
would
frustrate
any
design

of
repeat

I
travel
without
cease
,
until
I
arrive
at
Franckfort
upon
the
Maine
,
where
I
assume
the
character
of
a
french
chevalier
,
and
strike
some
masterly
stroke
,
which
you
yourself
would
not
have
deem
unworthy
of
your
invention
;
and
my
success
be
the
more
agreeable
,
as
my
operation
be
chiefly
carry
on
against
the
enemy
of
our
religion
:
but
my
prosperity
be
not
of
long
duration
.
 
<EOS>
see
they
could
not
foil
me
at
my
own
weapon
,
they
form
a
damned
conspiracy
,
by
which
I
not
only
lose
all
the
fruit
of
my
industry
,
but
likewise
run
the
most
imminent
hazard
of
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
order
some
of
those
jewel
which
I
have
borrow
of
my
good
friend
Fathom
,
to
be
new
set
in
a
fashionable
taste
,
and
soon
after
have
an
opportunity
to
sell
one
of
these
at
a
great
advantage
,
to
one
of
the
fraternity
,
who
offer
an
extraordinary
price
for
the
stone
,
on
purpose
to
effect
my
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
in
less
than
four
and
twenty
hour
after
this
bargain
,
I
be
arrest
by
the
officer
of
justice
,
upon
the
oath
of
the
purchaser
,
who
undertake
to
prove
me
guilty
of
a
fraud
,
in
sell
a
Saxon
pebble
for
a
real
diamond
;
and
this
accusation
be
actually
true
;
for
the
change
have
be
artfully
put
upon
me
,
by
the
jeweller
,
<EOS>
who
be
himself
engage
in
the
conspiracy
.
    
<EOS>
have
my
conscience
be
clear
of
any
other
impeachment
,
perhaps
,
I
should
have
rest
my
cause
upon
the
equity
and
protection
of
the
law
;
but
I
foresaw
that
the
trial
would
introduce
an
inquiry
,
to
which
I
be
not
at
all
ambitious
of
submitting
,
and
therefore
be
fain
to
compromise
the
affair
,
at
the
price
of
almost
my
whole
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
yet
this
acommodation
be
not
make
so
secretly
,
but
that
my
character
be
blast
,
and
my
credit
overthrown
;
so
that
I
be
fain
to
relinquish
my
occasional
equipage
,
and
hire
myself
as
journeyman
to
a
lapidary
,
an
employment
which
I
have
excercise
in
my
youth
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
obscure
station
,
I
labour
with
great
assiduity
,
until
I
make
myself
perfect
in
the
knowledge
of
stone
,
as
well
as
in
the
different
method
of
set
them
off
to
the
good
advantage
;
and
have
,
by
dint
of
industry
and
address
,
get
possession
of
a
small
parcel
,
set
out
for
this
kingdom
,
in
which
I
happily
arrive
about
four
month
ago
;
and
surely
England
be
the
paradise
of
artist
of
our
profession
.
    
<EOS>
one
would
imagine
,
that
nature
have
create
the
inhabitant
,
for
the
support
and
enjoyment
of
adventurer
like
you
and
me
.
    
<EOS>
not
that
these
islander
open
the
arm
of
hospitality
to
all
foreigner
without
distinction
:
on
the
contrary
,
they
inherit
from
their
father
,
an
unreasonable
prejudice
against
all
nation
under
the
sun
;
and
when
an
Englishman
happen
to
quarrel
with
a
stranger
,
the
first
term
of
reproach
he
use
,
be
the
name
of
his
antagonist
's
country
,
characterize
by
some
opprobrious
epithet
;
such
as
a
chatter
Frenchman
,
an
italian
ape
,
a
german
hog
,
and
a
beastly
Dutchman
;
nay
,
their
national
prepossession
be
maintain
even
against
those
people
with
whom
they
be
unite
,
under
the
same
law
and
government
;
for
nothing
be
more
common
than
to
hear
them
exclaim
against
their
fellow
-
subject
,
in
the
expression
of
a
beggarly
Scot
,
and
an
impudent
irish
bog
-
trotter
.
 
<EOS>
yet
this
very
prejudice
will
never
fail
to
turn
to
the
account
of
every
stranger
possess
of
ordinary
talent
;
for
he
will
always
find
opportunity
of
converse
with
them
in
coffee
-
house
,
and
place
of
public
resort
,
in
spite
of
their
profess
reserve
,
which
,
by
the
by
,
be
so
extraordinary
,
that
I
know
some
people
who
have
live
twenty
year
in
the
same
house
,
without
exchange
one
word
with
their
next
door
neighbour
;
yet
provide
he
can
talk
sensibly
,
and
preserve
the
deportment
of
a
sober
gentleman
,
in
those
occasional
conversation
,
his
behaviour
will
be
the
more
remarkably
pleasing
,
as
it
will
agreeably
disappoint
the
expectation
of
the
person
,
who
have
entertain
notion
to
his
prejudice
.
    
<EOS>
when
a
foreigner
have
once
cross
this
bar
,
which
perpetually
occur
,
he
sail
without
further
difficulty
into
the
harbour
of
an
Englishman
's
good
will
;
for
the
pique
be
neither
personal
nor
rancorous
,
but
rather
contemptuous
and
national
;
so
that
while
he
despise
a
people
in
the
lump
,
an
individual
of
that
very
community
,
may
be
one
of
his
chief
favourite
.
    
<EOS>
the
English
be
in
general
upright
and
honest
,
therefore
unsuspecting
and
credulous
:
they
be
too
much
engross
with
their
own
business
,
to
pry
into
the
conduct
of
their
neighbour
,
and
too
indifferent
,
in
point
of
disposition
,
to
interest
themselves
,
in
what
they
conceive
to
be
foreign
to
their
own
concern
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
wealthy
and
mercantile
,
of
consequence
liberal
and
adventurous
,
and
so
well
disposed
to
take
a
man
's
own
word
for
his
importance
,
that
they
suffer
themselves
to
be
pray
upon
by
such
a
bungling
set
of
impostor
,
as
would
starve
for
lack
of
address
,
in
any
other
country
under
the
sun
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
true
sketch
of
the
british
character
,
so
far
as
I
have
be
able
to
observe
and
learn
,
you
will
easily
comprehend
the
profit
that
may
be
extract
from
it
,
by
virtue
of
those
art
by
which
you
so
eminently
excel
;
the
great
the
unbounded
prospect
lie
before
me
!
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
look
upon
this
opulent
kingdom
,
as
a
wide
and
fertile
common
,
on
which
we
adventurer
may
range
for
prey
,
without
let
or
molestation
:
for
so
jealous
be
the
native
of
their
liberty
,
that
they
will
not
bear
the
restraint
of
necessary
Police
,
and
an
able
artist
may
enrich
himself
with
their
spoil
,
without
run
any
risque
of
attract
the
notice
of
the
magistrate
,
or
incur
the
least
penalty
of
the
law
.
    
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
this
metropolis
be
a
vast
masquerade
,
in
which
a
man
of
stratagem
may
wear
a
thousand
different
disguise
,
without
danger
of
detection
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
variety
of
shape
,
in
which
we
knight
of
the
industry
,
make
our
appearance
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
one
glide
into
a
nobleman
's
house
in
the
capacity
of
a
valet
de
chambre
,
and
in
a
few
month
lead
the
whole
family
by
the
nose
.
 
<EOS>
another
exhibit
himself
to
the
public
,
as
an
empiric
or
operator
for
the
tooth
:
and
by
dint
of
assurance
and
affidavit
,
bear
testimony
to
wonderful
cure
that
never
be
perform
,
whirls
himself
into
his
chariot
,
and
lay
the
town
under
contribution
:
a
third
profess
the
composition
of
musick
,
as
well
as
the
performance
,
and
by
mean
of
a
few
 
Capriciosos
on
the
violin
,
properly
introduce
,
wriggle
himself
into
the
management
of
private
and
public
concert
;
and
a
fourth
break
forth
at
once
in
all
the
splendor
of
a
gay
equipage
,
under
the
title
and
denomination
of
a
foreign
count
.
 
<EOS>
not
to
mention
those
inferior
projector
,
who
assume
the
character
of
dancer
,
fence
-
master
,
and
french
usher
,
or
by
renounce
their
religion
,
seek
to
obtain
a
provision
for
life
.
    
<EOS>
either
of
these
part
will
turn
to
the
account
of
an
able
actor
;
and
as
you
be
equally
qualified
for
all
,
you
may
choose
that
which
be
most
suitable
to
your
own
inclination
:
though
in
my
opinion
,
you
be
design
by
nature
,
to
shine
in
the
great
world
,
which
,
after
all
,
be
the
most
ample
field
,
for
man
of
genius
;
because
the
game
be
deep
,
and
people
of
fashion
being
,
for
the
most
part
,
more
ignorant
,
indolent
,
vain
and
capricious
,
than
their
inferior
,
be
of
consequence
more
easily
deceive
;
besides
their
moral
sit
generally
so
loose
about
them
that
when
a
gentleman
of
our
fraternity
be
discover
in
the
exercise
of
his
profession
,
their
contempt
of
his
skill
be
the
only
disgrace
he
incur
.
"
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
be
so
well
pleased
with
this
picture
,
that
he
long
to
peruse
the
original
,
and
before
these
two
friend
part
,
they
settle
all
the
operation
of
the
campaign
.
 
<EOS>
Ratchkali
,
that
same
evening
,
hire
magnificent
lodging
for
count
Fathom

in
the
court
end
of
the
town
,
and
furnish
his
wardrobe
and
livery
from
the
spoil
of
Monmouth

street
;
he
likewise
enlist
another
footman
and
valet
de

into
his
service
,
and
send
to
the
apartment
diver
large
trunk
,
suppose
to
be
fill
with
the
baggage
of
this
foreign
nobleman
,
though
in
reality
,
they
contain
little
else
than
common
lumber
.
    
<EOS>
Next
day
,
our
adventurer
take
possession
of
his
new
habitation
,
after
have
leave
to
his
friend
and
associate
the
task
of
dismiss
the
unfortunate
Ellenor
,
who
be
so
shocked
at
the
unexpected
message
,
that
she
faint
away
;
and
when
she
recover
the
use
of
her
sense
,
so
well
as
to
reflect
upon
her
forlorn
condition
,
she
be
seize
with
the
most
violent
transport
of
grief
and
dismay
,
by
which
her
brain
be
disorder
to
such
a
degree
,
that
she
grow
furious
and
distract

and
be

by
the
advice
and
assistance
of
the
Tyroleze
,
convey
into
the
hospital
of
Bethlem
;
where
we
shall
leave
her
for
the
present
,
happily
bereft
of
her
reason

<EOS>
He
appear
in
the
great
world
with
universal
applause
and
admiration

<EOS>
while
,
Fathom
and
his
engine
be
busy
in
compleate
his
equipage

so
that
in
a
few
day
,
he
have
procure
a
very
gay
chariot
,
adorn
with
painting
,
gilding
and
a
coat
of
arm
,
accord
to
his
own
fancy
and
direction
:
the
first
use
he
make
of
this
vehicle
,
be
that
of
visit
the
young
nobleman
from
whom
he
have
receive
such
important
civility
on
the
road
,
in
consequence
of
an
invitation
at
parting
,
by
which
he
learn
his
title
and
the
place
of
his
abode
in
London
.
    
<EOS>
His
lordship
be
not
only
pleased
,
but
proud
to
see
such
a
stranger
at
his
gate
,
and
entertain
him
with
excess
of
complaisance

hospitality

insomuch

that
by
his
mean
our

soon
become

with
the
whole
circle
of
polite
company
,
by
whom
he
be
caress
for
his
insinuate
manner
and
agreeable
conversation
.
    
<EOS>
He
have
think
proper
to
tell
the
nobleman
at
their
first
interview
in
town
,
that
his
reason
for
conceal
his
knowledge
of
the
english
tongue
be
now

and
that
he
would
no
longer
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
speak
a
language
which
have
be
always
music
to
his
ear

he
have
also
thank
his
lordship
for
his
generous
interposition
at
the
inn

which
be
an
instance
of
that
generosity

true
politeness

which
be
engross
by
the
english
people
,
who
leave
nought
to
other
nation
but
the
meer
shadow
of
these
virtue
.
    
<EOS>
a
testimony
like
this
from
the
mouth
of
such
a
noble
stranger
,
win
the
heart
of
the
peer
,
who
profess
a
friendship
for
him
on
the
spot
,
and
undertake
to
see
justice
do
to
his
lacquey
,
who
in
a
short
time
be
gratify
with
a
share
of
the
seisure
which
have
be
make
upon
his
information

amount
to
fifty
or
sixty
pound

<EOS>
Ferdinand
put
not
forth
the
whole
strength
of
his
acomplishment
at
once
,
but
contrive
to
spring
a
new
mine
of
qualification
every
day
,
to
the
surprize
and
admiration
of
all
his
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
gift
with
a
sort
of
elocution
,
much
more
specious
than
solid
,
and
speak
on
every
subject
that
occur
in
conversation
,
with
that
familiarity
and
ease
,
which
,
one
would
think
,
could
only
be
acquire
by
long
study
and
application
.
 
<EOS>
this
plausibility
and
confidence
,
be
faculty
really
inherit
from
nature
,
and
effectually
serve
the
possessor
,
in
lieu
of
that
learning
,
which
be
not
to
be
obtain
without
infinite
toil
and
perseverance
:
the
most
superficial
tincture
of
the
art
and
science
in
such
a
juggler
,
be
sufficient
to
dazzle
the
understanding
of
half
mankind
;
and
if
manage
with
circumspection
,
will
enable
him
even
to
spend
his
life
among
the
literati
,
without
once
forfeit
the
character
of
a
connoisseur
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
be
perfectly
master
of
this
leger
-
demain
,
which
he
carry
to
such
a
pitch
of
assurance
,
as
to
declare
in
the
midst
of
a
mathematical
assembly
,
that
he
intend
to
gratify
the
publick
with
a
full
confutation
of
Sir
Isaac
Newton
's
philosophy
,
to
the
nature
of
which
he
be
as
much
a
stranger
as
the
most
savage
Hottentot
in
Afric
.
 
<EOS>
His
pretension
to
profound
and
universal
knowledge
,
be
support
not
only
by
this
kind
of
presumption
,
but
also
by
the
facility
with
which
he
speak
so
many
different
language
,
and
the
shrewd
remark
he
have
make
in
the
course
of
his
travel
and
observation
.
    
<EOS>
among
politician
,
he
settle
the
balance
of
power
upon
a
certain
footing
,
by
dint
of
ingenious
scheme
,
which
he
have
contrive
for
the
welfare
of
Europe
.
 
<EOS>
with
officer
,
he
reform
the
art
of
war
,
with
improvement
which
have
occur
to
his
reflection
,
while
he
be
engage
in
a
military
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
sometimes
hold
forth
upon
painting
,
like
a
member
of
the
Dillettanti
club
:
the
theory
of
musick
be
a
theme
upon
which
he
seem
to
expatiate
with
particular
pleasure
:
in
the
province
of
love
and
gallantry
,
he
be
a
perfect
Oroondates
:
he
possess
a
most
agreeable
manner
of
tell
entertaining
story
,
of
which
he
have
a
large
collection
:
he
sing
with
great
melody
and
taste
,
and
play
upon
the
violin
with
surprize
execution
.
 
<EOS>
to
these
qualification
,
let
us
add
his
affability
and
pliant
disposition
,
and
then
the
reader
will
not
wonder
that
he
be
look
upon
as
the
pattern
of
human
perfection
,
and
his
acquaintance
court
accordingly
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
thus
captivate
the
favour
and
affection
of
the
english
nobility
,
he
do
not
neglect
to
take
other
measure
in
behalf
of
the
partnership
to
which
he
have
subscribe
.
    
<EOS>
this
adventure
with
the
two
squire
at
Paris
,
have
weaken
his
appetite
for
play
,
which
be
not
at
all
restore
by
the
observation
he
have
make
in
London
,
where
the
art
of
gaming
be
reduce
into
a
regular
system
,
and
its
professor
so
laudably
devoted
to
the

their

<EOS>
no
Indian
Brachman
could
live
more
abstemious
than
two
of
the
pack
,
who
hunt
in
couple
,
and
kennel
in
the
upper
apartment
of
the
hotel
in
which
our
adventurer
live
:
they
abstain
from
animal
food
with
the
abhorrence
of
Pythagoreans
,
their
drink
be
the
pure
simple
element
,
they
be
vomit
once
a
week
,
take
physic
or
a
glyster
every
third
day
,
spend
the
forenoon
in
algebraical
calculation
,
and
sleep
from
four
o'clock
till
midnight
,
that
they
may
then
take
the
field
with
that
cool
serenity
which
be
the
effect
of
refreshment
and
repose
.
    
<EOS>
these
be
term
upon
which
our
hero
would
not
risque
his
fortune
;
he
be
too
much
addict
to
pleasure
to
forego
every
other
enjoyment
but
that
of
amass
;
and
do
not
so
much
depend
upon
his
dexterity
in
play
,
as
upon
his
talent
of
insinuation
,
which
by
this
time
have
succeed
so
far
beyond
his
expectation
,
that
he
begin
to
indulge
the
hope
of
enslave
the
heart
of
some
rich
heiress
,
whose
fortune
would
at
once
raise
him
above
all
dependance
.
    
<EOS>
indeed
no
man
ever
set
out
with
a
fairer
prospect
on
such
an
expedition
;
for
,
he
have
find
mean
to
render
himself
so
agreeable
to
the
fair
sex
,
that
,
like
the
box
of
the
play
-
house
,
during
the
representation
of
a
new
performance
,
his
company
be
often
bespeak
for
a
series
of
week
;
and
no
lady
,
whether
widow
,
wife
,
or
maiden
,
ever
mention
his
name
,
without
some
epithet
of
esteem
or
affection
;
such
as
the
dear
Count
!
<EOS>
the
charming
man
!
<EOS>
the
Nonpareil
!
or
the
Angel
!
    
<EOS>
while
he
thus
shine
in
the
zerinth
of
admiration
,
it
be
not
be
doubt
,
that
he
could
have
melt
some
wealthy
dowager
or
opulent
ward
:
but
be
an
enemy
to
all
precipitate
engagement
,
he
resolve
to
act
with
great
care
and
deliberation
in
an
affair
of
such
importance
,
especially
as
he
do
not
find
himself
hurry
by
the
importunity
of
want
:
for
since
his
arrival
in
England
,
he
have
rather
increase
than
exhaust
his
finance
,
by
method
equally
certain
and
secure
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
he
with
the
assistance
of
Ratchkali
carry
on
a
traffick
,
which
yield
great
profit
,
without
subject
the
trader
to
the
least
loss
or
inconvenience
.
 
<EOS>
Fathom
,
for
example
,
wear
upon
his
finger
a
large
brilliant
,
which
he
play
to
such
advantage
one
night
,
at
a
certain
nobleman
's
house
,
where
he
be
prevail
upon
to
entertain
the
company
with
a
solo
on
the
violin
,
that
every
body
present
take
notice
of
its
uncommon
lustre
,
and
it
be
hand
about
for
the
perusal
of
every
individual
.
    
<EOS>
the
water
and
the
workmanship
be
universally
admire
;
and
one
among
the
rest
,
have
express
a
desire
of
know
the
value
of
such
a
jewel
,
the
count
seize
that
opportunity
of
entertain
them
with
a
learned
disquisition
into
the
nature
of
stone
;
this
introduce
the
history
of
the
diamond
in
question
,
which
he
say
have
be
purchase
of
an
indian
trader
of
Fort
St
George
,
at
an
under
price
;
so
that
the
present
proprietor
could
afford
to
sell
it
at
a
very
reasonable
rate
;
and
conclude
with
tell
the
company
,
that
for
his
own
part
,
he
have
be
importune
to
wear
it
by
the
jeweller
,
who
imagine
it
would
have
a
well
chance
for
attract
a
purchaser
on
his
finger
,
than
while
it
remain
in
his
own
custody
.
    
<EOS>
this
declaration
be
no
sooner
make
,
than
a
certain
lady
of
quality
,
bespoke
the
refuse
of
the
jewel
,
and
desire
Ferdinand
to
send
the
owner
next
day
to
her
house
,
where
he
accordingly
wait
upon
her
ladyship
with
the
ring
,
for
which
he
receive
one
hundred
and
fifty
guinea
,
two
third
of
the
sum
be
clear
gain
,
and
equally
divide
betwixt
the
associates
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
this
bargain
such
as
reflect
dishonour
upon
the
lady
's
taste
,
or
could
be
productive
of
ill
consequence
to
the
merchant
:
<EOS>
for
the
method
of
estimate
diamond
be
altogether
arbitrary
;
and
Ratchkali
,
who
be
an
exquisite
lapidary
,
have
set
it
in
such
a
manner
as
would
have
impose
upon
any
ordinary
jeweller
.
 
<EOS>
by
these
mean
of
introduction
,
the
Tyroleze
soon
monopolize
the
custom
of
a
great
many
noble
family
,
upon
which
he
levy
large
contribution
,
without
incur
the
least
suspicion
of
deceit
:
he
every
day
out
of
pure
esteem
and
gratitude
for
the
honour
of
their
command
,
entertain
them
with
the
sight
of
some
new
trinket
,
which
he
be
never
permit
to
carry
home
,
unsold
;
and
from
the
profit
of
each
job
,
a
tax
be
raise
for
the
benefit
of
our
adventurer
.
    
<EOS>
yet
his
indultos
be
not
confine
to
the
article
of
jewel
,
which
constitute
only
one
part
of
his
revenue
:
by
the
industry
of
his
understrapper
,
he
procure
a
number
of
old
crazy
fiddle
,
which
be
throw
aside
as
lumber
;
upon
which
he
counterfeit
the
Cremona
mark
,
and
otherwise
cook'd
<EOS>
them
up
with
great
dexterity
;
so
that
when
he
have
occasion
to
regale
the
lover
of
music
,
he
would
send
for
one
of
these
vamp
instrument
,
and
extract
from
it
such
tone
as
quite
ravish
the
hearer
;
among
whom
there
be
always
some
conceited
pretender
,
who
speak
in
rapture
of
the
violin
,
and
give
our
hero
an
opportunity
of
launch
out
in
its
praise
,
and
declare
it
be
the
good
Cremona
he
have
ever
touch
.
 
<EOS>
this
encomium
never
fail
to
inflame
the
desire
of
the
audience
,
to
some
one
of
whom
,
he
be
generous
enough
to
part
with
it
at
prime
cost
,
that
is
,
for
twenty
or
thirty
guinea
clear
profit
;
for
he
be
often
able
to
oblige
his
friend
in
this
manner
,
because
,
be
an
eminent
connoisseur
,
his
countenance
be
solicit
by
all
the
musician
,
who
want
to
dispose
of
such
moveable
.
    
<EOS>
nor
do
he
neglect
the
other
resource
of
a
skilful
virtuoso
.
 
<EOS>
every
auction
afford
some
picture
,
in
which
,
though
it
have
be
overlook
by
the
ignorance
of
the
time
,
he
recognize
the
stile
of
a
great
master
,
and
make
a
merit
of
recommend
it
to
some
noble
friend
.
 
<EOS>
this
commerce
he
likewise
extend
to
medal
,
bronze
,
bust
,
intaglio
and
old
china
,
and
keep
diver
artificer
continually
employ
in
make
antique
for
the
english
nobility
.
 
<EOS>
thus
he
go
on
with
such
rapidity
of
success
in
all
his
endeavour
,
that
he
himself
be
astonish
at
the
infatuation
he
have
produce
.
    
<EOS>
nothing
be
so
wretched
among
the
production
of
art
,
that
he
could
not
impose
upon
the
world
as
a
capital
performance
;
and
so
fascinated
be
the
eye
of
his
admirer
,
he
could
easily
have
persuade
them
that
a
barber
's
bason
be
an
Etrurian
Patera
,
and
the
cover
of
a
copper
pot
,
no
other
than
the
shield
of
Ancus
Martius
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
it
be
become
so
fashionable
to
consult
the
count
in
every
thing
relate
to
taste
and
politeness
,
that
not
a
plan
be
draw
,
not
even
an
house
furnish
without
his
advice
and
approbation
;
<EOS>
nay
,
to
such
a
degree
do
his
reputation
in
these
matter
excel
,
that
a
particular
pattern
of
paper
-
hanging
be
know
by
the
name
of
Fathom
;
and
his
hall
be
every
morning
croude
with
upholsterer
and
other
tradesman
,
who
come
by
order
of
their
employer
,
to
learn
his
choice
,
and
take
his
direction
.
    
<EOS>
the
character
and
influence
he
thus
acquire
he
take
care
to
maintain
with
the
utmost
assiduity
and
circumspection
:
he
never
fail
to
appear
the
chief
personage
at
all
public
diversion
,
and
private
assembly
,
not
only
in
conversation
and
dress
,
but
also
in
the
article
of
dancing
,
in
which
he
outstrip
all
his
fellow
,
as
far
as
in
every
other
genteel
accomplishment
.
     
<EOS>
He
attract
the
envy
and
ill
office
of
the
minor
knight
of
his
own
order
,
over
whom
he
obtain
a
compleat
victory
   
<EOS>
such
a
preheminence
could
not
be
enjoy
without
excite
the
malevolence
of
envy
and
detraction
,
in
the
propagation
of
which
,
none
be
so
industrious
as
the
brother
of
his
own
order
,
who
have
,
like
him
,
make
a
descent
upon
this
island
,
and
could
not
,
without
repine
,
see
the
whole
harvest
in
the
hand
of
one
man
,
who
with
equal
art
and
discretion
avoid
all
intercourse
with
their
society
.
 
<EOS>
in
vain
they
strove
to
discover
his
pedigree
,
and
detect
the
particular
circumstance
of
his
life
and
conversation
;
all
their
inquiry
be
baffle
by
the
obscurity
of
his
origin
,
and
that
solitary
scheme
which
he
have
adopt
in
the
beginning
of
his
career
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
fruit
of
their
investigation
amount
to
no
more
than
a
certainty
,
that
there
be
no
family
of
any
consideration
in
Europe
,
know
by
the
denomination
of
Fathom
;
and
this
discovery
they
do
not
fail
to
divulge
for
the
benefit
of
our
adventurer
,
who
have
by
this
time
take
such
firm
root
in
the
favour
of
the
great
,
as
to
set
all
those
little
art
at
defiance
;
and
when
the
report
reach
his
ear
,
actually
make
his
friend
merry
with
the
conjecture
which
have
be
circulate
at
his
expence
.
    
<EOS>
His
adversary
,
find
themselves
disappoint
in
this
effort
,
hold
a
consultation
to
devise
other
measure
against
him
,
and
come
to
a
resolution
of
end
him
by
the
sword
,
or
rather
of
expel
him
from
the
kingdom
,
by
the
fear
of
death
,
which
he
hope
he
have
not
courage
enough
to
resist
,
because
his
deportment
have
be
always
remarkably
mild
and
pacific
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
upon
this
supposition
,
that
they
leave
to
the
determination
of
the
dice
,
the
choice
of
the
person
who
should
execute
their
plan
;
and
the
lot
fall
upon
a
Swiss
,
who
,
from
the
station
of
a
foot
soldier
in
the
dutch
service
,
out
of
which
he
have
be
drum
for
theft
,
have
erect
himself
into
the
rank
of
a
self
create
chevalier
;
this
hero
fortify
himself
with
a
double
dose
of
brandy
,
and
betook
himself
to
a
certain
note
coffee
-
house
,
with
an
intent
to
affront
Count
Fathom
in
publick
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
lucky
enough
to
find
our
adventurer
sit
at
a
table
in
conversation
with
some
person
of
the
first
rank
;
upon
which
he
seat
himself
in
the
next
box
,
and
after
have
intrude
himself
into
their
discourse
,
which
happen
to
turn
upon
the
politick
of
some
german
court
;
"
Count
,
"
say
he
to
Ferdinand
,
in
a
very
abrupt
and
disagreeable
manner
of
adress
,
"
I
be
last
night
in
company
with
some
gentleman
,
among
whom
a
dispute
happen
about
the
place
of
your
nativity
;
pray
,
what
country
be
you
of
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
answer
the
other
,
with
great
politeness
,
"
I
at
present
have
the
honour
to
be
of
England
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oho
!
"
reply
the
chevalier
,
"
I
ask
your
pardon
,
that
be
to
say
,
you
be
incog
.
   
<EOS>
some
people
may
find
it
convenient
to
keep
themselves
in
that
situation
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
true
,
"
say
the
count
,
"
but
some
people
be
too
well
known
to
enjoy
that
privilege
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
Swiss
be
a
little
disconcert
at
this
repartee
,
which
extract
a
smile
from
the
audience
;
after
some
pause
,
observe
,
that
person
of
a
certain
class
have
good
reason
to
drop
the
remembrance
of
what
they
have
be
;
but
a
good
citizen
will
not
forget
his
country
or
former
condition
.
    
<EOS>
"
and
a
bad
citizen
,
"
saith
Fathom
,
"
can
not
if
he
would
,
provide
he
have
meet
with
his
desert
;
a
sharp
may
as
well
forget
the
shape
of
a
dye
,
or
a
discard
soldier
the
sound
of
a
drum
.
"
    
<EOS>
as
the
chevalier
's
character
and
story
be
not
unknown
,
this
application
raise
an
universal
laugh
at
his
expence
,
which
provoke
him
to
such
a
degree
,
that
start
up
,
he
swear
Fathom
could
not
have
mention
any
object
in
nature
that
he
himself
resemble
so
much
as
a
drum
,
which
be
exactly
typify
by
his
emptiness
and
sound
,
with
this
difference
however
,
that
a
drum
be
never
noisy
till
beat
,
whereas
the
count
would
never
be
quiet
until
he
should
have
undergo
the
same
discipline
.
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
lay
his
hand
upon
his
sword
with
a
menacing
look
,
and
walk
out
as
if
in
expectation
of
be
follow
by
our
adventurer
,
who
suffer
himself
to
be
detain
by
the
company
,
and
very
calmly
take
notice
,
that
his
antagonist
would
not
be
ill
pleased
at
their
interposition
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
he
would
not
have
comport
himself
with
such
ease
and
deliberation
,
have
not
he
make
such
remark
upon
the
disposition
of
the
chevalier
,
as
convince
him
of
his
own
safety
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
perceive
a
perplexity
and
perturbation
in
the
countenance
of
the
Swiss
,
when
he
first
enter
the
coffee
-
room
;
his
blunt
and
precipitate
way
of
accost
him
,
seem
to
denote
confusion
and
compulsion
,
and
in
the
midst
of
his
ferocity
,
this
accurate
observer
discern
the
trepidation
of
fear
.
 
<EOS>
by
the
help
of
these
sign
,
his
sagacity
soon
comprehend
the
nature
of
his
scheme
,
and
prepare
accordingly
for
a
formal
defiance
.
    
<EOS>
His
conjecture
be
verify
next
morning
by
a
visit
from
the
chevalier
,
who
take
it
for
grant
that
Fathom
would
not
face
an
adversary
in
the
field
,
because
he
have
not
follow
him
from
the
coffee
-
house
,
go
to
his
lodging
with
great
confidence
,
and
demand
to
see
the
count
upon
an
affair
that
would
admit
of
no
delay
.
 
<EOS>
Maurice
,
accord
to
his
instruction
,
tell
him
that
his
master
be
go
out
,
but
desire
he
would
have
the
goodness
to
repose
himself
in
a
parlour
,
till
the
count
's
return
,
which
he
expect
every
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Ferdinand
,
who
have
take
post
in
a
proper
place
for
observation
,
see
his
antagonist
fairly
admit
,
take
the
same
road
,
and
appear
before
him
,
wrap
up
in
a
long
spanish
cloak
,
desire
to
know
what
have

with
these

with
a

with
recent

as
if
he
have
just
come
from
the
slaughter
of
a
foe

<EOS>
this
phaenomenon
make
such
an
impression
upon
the
astonished
chevalier
,
already
discompose
by
the
resolute
behaviour
of
the
count
,
that
he
become

with
terror

he
have
hope
from
his

politeness
,
to
have
find
him
ready
to
acknowledge
an
injury
which
may
have
be
the
effect
of
anger

among

<EOS>
to
this
representation
,
Ferdinand
answer
,
that
the
affair
have
be
of
the
chevalier
's
own
seeking
,
inasmuch
as
he
have
intrude
himself
into
his
company
,
and
treat
him
with
the
most
insolent
and
unprovoked
abuse
,
which
plainly
flow
from
a
premeditated
design
against
his
honour
and
reputation
;
he
therefore
,
far
from
be
dispose
to
own
himself
in
the
wrong
,
would
not
even
accept
of
a
public
acknowledgment
from
him
the
aggressor
,
whom
he
look
upon
as
an
infamous
sharper
,
and
be
resolve
to
chastise
accordingly
.
    
<EOS>
here
the
conversation
be
interrupt
by
the
arrival
of
a
person
who
be
bring
to
the
door

and
conduct
into

from

a
message

,
that
the
stranger

<EOS>
Fathom
have
chid
the
servant

admit
people
without

desire
the
Swiss
to
excuse
him
for
a
minute
longer
,
and
go
into
the
next
room
;
from
whence
the
follow
dialogue
be
overhear
by
this
challenger
.
    
<EOS>
"
Count
,
"
say
the
stranger
,
"
you
be
not
ignorant
of
my
pretension
to
the
heart
of
that
young
lady
,
at
whose
house
I
meet
you
yesterday
;
therefore
you
can
not
be
surprize
when
I
declare
myself
displeased
with
your
visit
and
behaviour
to
my
mistress
,
and
demand
that
you
will
instantly
promise
to
drop
the
correspondence
.

"
 
<EOS>
"
else
what
follow
?
<EOS>
"
answer
Ferdinand
,
with
a
cool
and
temperate
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
resentment
and
immediate
defiance
;
reply
the
other
,
for
the
only
alternative
I
propose
,
be
to
forego
your
design
upon
that
lady
,
or
to
decide
our
pretension
by
the
sword
.
"
    
Our
hero
have
express
a
regard
for
this
visitant
,
as
the
son
of
a
gentleman
whom
he
honour
,
be
at
the
pain
to
represent
the
unreasonableness
of
his
demand
,
and
the
folly
of
his
presumption
;
and
earnestly
exhort
him
to
put
the
issue
of
his
cause
upon
a
more
safe
and
equitable
footing
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
admonition
,
instead
of
appease
the
wrath
,
seem
to
inflame
the
resentment
of
the
opponent
,
who
swear
he
would
not
leave
him
until
he
should
have
accomplish
the
purport
of
his
errand
.
    
<EOS>
in
vain
our
adventurer
request
half
an
hour
for
the
dispatch
of
some
urgent
business
,
in
which
he
be
engage
with
a
gentleman
in
the
other
parlour
:
this
impetuous
rival
reject
all
the
term
he
could
propose
,
and
even
challenge
him
to
decide
the
controversy
upon
the
spot
;
an
expedient
to
which
the
other
have
assent
with
reluctance
,
the
door
be
secure
,
the
sword
unsheathe
,
and
an
hot
engagement
ensue
,
to
the
inexpressible
pleasure
of
the
Swiss
,
who
do
not
doubt
that
he
himself
would
be
screen
from
all
danger
by
the
event
of
this
rencontre
;
nevertheless
,
his
hope
be
disappoint
in
the
defeat
of
the
stranger
,
who
be
quickly
disarm
,
in
consequence
of
a
wound
through
the
sword
arm
;
upon
which
occasion
Fathom
be
hear
to
say
,
that
,
in
consideration
of
his
youth
and
family
,
he
have
spare
his
life
;
but
he
would
not
act
with
the
same
tenderness
towards
any
other
antagonist
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
bind
up
the
limb
he
have
disable
,
conduct
the
vanquished
party
to
his
chair
,
rejoin
the
chevalier
with
a
serene
countenance
,
and
ask
pardon
for
have
detain
him
so
long
,
propose
they
should
instantly
set
out
in
an
hackney
coach
,
for
the
place
of
appointment
.
    
<EOS>
the
stratagem
thus
conduct
,
have
all
the
success
the
inventor
could
desire
.
 
<EOS>
the
fear
of
the
Swiss
have
rise
almost
to
an
extasy
,
before
the
count
quit
the
room
;
but
after
this
sham
battle
,
which
have
be
preconcerte
betwixt
our
adventurer
and
his
friend
Ratchkali
,
the
chevalier
's
terror
be
unspeakable
.
 
<EOS>
He
consider
Fathom
as
a
devil
incarnate
,
and
go
into
the
coach
as
a
melafactor
bind
for
Tyburn
.
    
<EOS>
He
would
have
gladly
compound
for
the
loss
of
a
leg
or
arm
,
and
entertain
some
transient
gleam
of
hope
,
that
he
should
escape
for
half
a
dozen
flesh
wound
,
which
he
would
have
willingly
receive
,
as
the
price
of
his
presumption
;
but
,
these
hope
be
banish
by
the
remembrance
of
that
dreadful
declaration
which
he
have
hear
the
count
make
,
after
have
overcome
his
last
adversary
;
and
he
continue
under
the
power
of
the
most
insupportable
pannic
,
until
the
carriage
halt
at
Hyde
-
park
-
corner
,
where
he
crawl
forth
in
a
most
piteous
and
lamentable
condition
;
so
that
when
they
reach
the
spot
,
he
be
scarce
able
to
stand
.
    
<EOS>
here
he
make
an
effort
to
speak
,
and
propose
an
accommodation
upon
a
new
plan
,
by
which
he
promise
to
leave
his
cause
to
the
arbitrement
of
those
gentleman
who
be
present
at
the
rupture
,
and
to
ask
pardon
of
the
count
,
provide
he
should
be
find
guilty
of
a
trespass
upon
good
manner
:
but
this
proposal
would
not
satisfy
the
implacable
Ferdinand
,
who
perceive
the
agony
of
the
Swiss
,
resolve
to
make
the
most
of
the
adventure
,
and
give
him
to
understand
he
be
not
a
man
to
be
trifle
with
,
desire
him
to
draw
without
further
preamble
.
 
<EOS>
thus
compel
,
the
unfortunate
gamester
pull
off
his
coat
,
and
put
himself
in
a
posture
,
to
use
the
word
of
Nym
,
"
wink
and
hold
out
his
cold
iron
.
"
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
,
far
from
make
a
gentle
use
of
the
advantage
he
possess
,
fiercely
attack
him
,
while
he
be
incapable
of
make
resistance
,
and
aim
at
a
fleshy
part
,
run
him
through
the
arm
and
outside
of
the
shoulder
at
the
very
first
pass
:
the
chevalier
,
already
stupifie
with
the
horror
of
expectation
,
no
sooner
feel
his
adversary
's
point
in
his
body
,
than
he
fall
to
the
ground
,
and
conclude
he
be
no
longer
a
man
for
this
world
,
begin
to
cross
himself
with
great
devotion
,
while
Fathom
walk
home
deliberately
,
and
in
his
way
send
a
couple
of
chairman
to
the
assistance
of
the
wound
knight
.
    
<EOS>
this
atchievement
,
which
could
not
be
conceal
from
the
knowledge
of
the
publick
,
not
only
furnish
the
character
of
Fathom
with
fresh
wreath
of
admiration
and
applause
,
but
likewise
effectually
secure
him
from
any
future
attempt
of
his
enemy
,
to
whom
the
Swiss
,
for
his
own
sake
,
have
communicate
such
terrible
idea
of
his
valour
,
as
over
-
awe
the
whole
community
.
     
<EOS>
He
perform
another
exploit
that
convey
a
true
idea
of
his
gratitude
and
honour
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
after
this
celebrate
victory
,
that
he
be
invite
to
spend
part
of
the
summer
,
at
the
house
of
a
country
gentleman
,
who
live
about
one
hundred
mile
from
London
,
possess
of
a
very
opulent
fortune
,
the
great
part
of
which
be
expend
in
act
of
old
english
hospitality
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
meet
with
our
hero
by
accident
,
at
the
table
of
a
certain
great
man
,
and
be
so
strike
with
his
manner
and
conversation
,
as
to
desire
his
acquaintance
and
cultivate
his
friendship
;
and
he
think
himself
extremely
happy
in
have
prevail
upon
him
to
pass
a
few
week
in
his
family
.
    
<EOS>
Fathom
,
among
his
other
observation
,
perceive
that
there
be
a
domestic
uneasiness
,
occasion
by
a
very
beautiful
young
creature
,
about
the
age
of
fifteen
,
who
reside
in
the
house
under
the
title
of
the
gentleman
's
niece
,
though
she
be
in
reality
,
his
natural
daughter
,
bear
before
his
marriage
.
    
<EOS>
this
circumstance
be
not
unknown
to
his
lady
,
by
whose
express
approbation
he
have
bestow
particular
attention
upon
the
education
of
the
child
,
whom
we
shall
distinguish
by
the
name
of
Celinda
:
their
liberality
in
this
particular
,
have
not
be
misapply
;
for
she
not
only
give
mark
of
uncommon
capacity
,
but
as
she
grow
up
,
become
more
and
more
amiable
in
her
person
,
and
be
now
return
from
the
boarding
-
school
,
possess
of
every
accomplishment
that
could
be
acquire
by
one
of
her
age
and
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
these
qualification
,
which
endear
her
to
every
other
person
,
excite
the
jealousy
and
displeasure
of
her
suppose
aunt
,
who
could
not
bear
to
see
her
own
child
eclipse
by
this
illegitimate
daughter
,
whom
she
therefore
discountenance
upon
all
occasion
,
and
expose
to
such
mortification
as
would
in
all
appearance
drive
her
from
her
father
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
this
persecute
spirit
be
very
disagreeable
to
the
husband
,
who
love
Celinda
with
a
truly
paternal
affection
,
and
produce
abundance
of
family
disquiet
;
but
be
a
man
of
a
peaceable
and
yield
disposition
,
he
could
not
long
maintain
the
resolution
he
have
take
in
her
favour
,
and
therefore
he
cease
oppose
the
malevolence
of
his
wife
.
    
<EOS>
in
this
unfortunate
predicament
stand
the
fair
bastard
,
at
the
arrival
of
our
adventurer
,
who
be
allure
by
her
charm
,
and
apprize
of
her
situation
at
the
same
time
,
take
the
generous
resolution
to
undermine
her
innocence
,
that
he
may
banquet
his
vicious
appetite
with
the
spoil
of
her
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
such
a
brutal
design
may
not
have
enter
his
imagination
,
if
he
have
not
observe
in
the
disposition
of
this
hapless
maiden
,
certain
peculiarity
from
which
he
derive
the
most
confident
presage
of
success
.
    
<EOS>
besides
a
total
want
of
experience
,
that
leave
her
open
and
unguarded
against
the
attack
of
the
other
sex
,
she
discover
a
remarkable
spirit
of
credulity
and
superstitious
fear
,
which
have
be
cherish
by
the
conversation
of
her
school
-
fellow
:
she
be
particularly
fond
of
musick
,
in
which
she
have
make
some
progress
;
but
so
delicate
be
the
texture
of
her
nerve
,
that
one
day
,
while
Fathom
entertain
the
company
with
a
favourite
air
,
she
actually
swoon
with
pleasure
.
    
<EOS>
such
sensibility
,
our
projector
well
know
,
must
be
diffuse
through
all
the
passion
of
her
heart
;
he
congratulate
himself
upon
the
sure
ascendancy
he
have
gain
over
her
in
this
particular
;
and
forthwith
begin
to
execute
the
plan
he
have
erect
for
her
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
may
the
more
effectually
deceive
the
vigilance
of
her
father
's
wife
,
he
throw
such
a
dash
of
affectation
in
his
complaisance
towards
Celinda
,
as
could
not
escape
the
notice
of
that
pry
matron
,
though
it
be
not
palpable
enough
to
disoblige
the
young
lady
herself
,
who
could
not
so
well
distinguish
between
overstrain
courtesy
and
real
good
breeding
<EOS>
:
this
behaviour
screen
him
from
the
suspicion
of
the
family
,
who
consider
it
as
an
effort
of
politeness
,
to
cover
his
indifference
and
disgust
for
the
daughter
of
his
friend
who
have
by
this
time
give
some
reason
to
believe
she
look
upon
him
with
the
eye
of
affection
;
so
that
the
opportunity
he
enjoy
of
converse
with
her
in
private
,
be
less
liable
to
intrusion
or
inquiry
.
    
<EOS>
indeed
,
from
what
I
have
already
observe
,
touch
the
sentiment
of
her
step
-
dame
,
that
lady
,
far
from
take
measure
for
thwart
our
hero
's
design
,
would
have
rejoice
at
the
execution
of
it
,
and
have
she
be
inform
of
his
intent
,
may
have
fall
upon
some
method
to
facilitate
the
enterprize
,
but
,
as
he
solely
depend
upon
his
own
talent
,
he
never
dream
of
solicit
such
an
auxiliary
.
    
<EOS>
under
cover
of
instruct
and
accomplish
her
in
the
exercise
of
musick
,
he
could
not
want
occasion
for
promote
his
aim
;
when
after
have
soothe
her
sense
of
hearing
,
even
to
a
degree
of
ravishment
,
so
as
to
extort
from
her
an
exclamation
,
import
,
that
he
be
surely
something
supernatural
!
<EOS>
he
never
fail
to
whisper
some
insidious
compliment
or
tale
of
love
,
exquisitely
suited
to
the
emotion
of
her
soul
.
 
<EOS>
thus
be
her
heart
insensibly
subdue
;
though
more
than
half
his
work
be
still
undone
;
for
,
at
all
time
,
she
disclose
such
purity
of
sentiment
,
such
inviolable
attachment
to
religion
and
virtue
,
and
seem
so
averse
to
all
sort
of
inflammatory
discourse
,
that
he
durst
not
presume
upon
the
footing
he
have
gain
in
her
affection
,
to
explain
the
baseness
of
his
desire
;
therefore
apply
to
another
of
her
passion
,
that
prove
the
bane
of
her
virtue
;
this
be
her
timidity
,
which
at
first
be
constitutional
,
be
afterwards
increase
by
the
circumstance
of
her
education
,
and
now
aggravate
by
the
artful
conversation
of
Fathom
,
which
he
chequer
with
dismal
story
of
omen
,
porten
,
prophecy
and
apparition
,
deliver
upon
such
unquestionable
testimony
,
and
with
such
mark
of
conviction
,
as
captivate
the
belief
of
the
devoted
Celinda
,
and
fill
her
imagination
with
unceasing
terror
.
    
<EOS>
in
vain
she
strove
to
dispel
those
frightful
idea
,
and
avoid
such
topic
of
discourse
for
the
future
<EOS>
:
the
more
she
endeavour
to
banish
them
,
the
more
troublesome
they
become
;
and
such
be
her
infatuation
,
that
as
her
terror
increase
,
her
thirst
after
that
sort
of
knowledge
be
augment
.
 
<EOS>
many
sleepless
night
<EOS>
do
she
pass
amidst
those
horror
of
fancy
,
start
at
every
noise
,
and
sweat
with
dreary
apprehension
,
yet
ashamed
to
own
her
fear
,
or
sollicit
the
comfort
of
a
bed
-
fellow
,
lest
she
should
incur
the
ridicule
and
censure
of
her
father
's
wife
;
and
what
render
this
disposition
the
more
irksome
,
be
the
solitary
situation
of
her
chamber
,
<EOS>
that
stand
at
the
end
of
a
long
gallery
scarce
within
hearing
of
any
other
inhabit
part
of
the
house
.
    
<EOS>
all
these
circumstance
have
be
duly
weigh
by
our
projector
,
who
have
prepare
Celinda
for
his
purpose
,
steal
at
midnight
from
his
apartment
,
which
be
in
another
story
,
and
approach
her
door
,
there
utter
a
piteous
groan
;
then
softly
retire
to
his
bed
,
in
full
confidence
of
see
next
day
the
effect
of
this
operation
:
nor
do
his
arrow
miss
the
mark
:
poor
Celinda
's
countenance
give
such
indication
of
melancholy
and
dismay
,
that
he
could
not
omit
ask
the
cause
of
her
disquiet
,
and
she
,
at
his
earnest
request
,
be
prevail
upon
to
communicate
the
dreadful
salutation
of
the
precede
night
,
which
she
consider
as
an
oman
of
death
to
some
person
in
the
family
,
in
all
probability
to
herself
,
as
the
groan
seem
to
issue
from
one
corner
of
her
own
apartment
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
argue
against
this
supposition
,
as
contradictory
to
the
common
observation
of
those
supernatural
warning
,
which
be
not
usually
impart
to
the
person
who
be
doom
to
die
,
but
to
some
faithful
friend
or
trusty
servant
,
particularly
interested
in
the
event
.
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
suppose
that
the
groans
forebode
the
death
of
my
lady
,
who
seem
to
be
in
a
drooping
state
of
health
,
and
be
by
her
genius
<EOS>
convey
to
the
organ
of
Celinda
,
who
be
the
chief
sufferer
by
her
jealous
and
barbarous
disposition
;
he
likewise
express
an
earnest
desire
to
be
an
ear
witness
of
such
solemn
communication
,
and
alledge
that
it
be
highly
improper
for
a
young
lady
of
her
delicate
feeling
,
to
expose
herself
alone
to
such
another
dismal
visitation
,
beg
he
may
be
allow
to
watch
all
night
in
her
chamber
,
in
order
to
defend
her
from
the
shocking
impression
of
fear
.
    
<EOS>
though
no
person
ever
stand
more
in
need
of
a
companion
or
guard
,
and
her
heart
throb
with
transport
of
dismay
at
the
prospect
of
night
,
she
reject
his
proposal
with
due
acknowledgement
,
and
resolve
to
trust
solely
to
the
protection
of
Heaven
:
not
that
she
think
her
innocence
or
reputation
could
suffer
by
her
compliance
with
his
request
;
for
hitherto
,
her
heart
be
a
stranger
to
those
young
desire
wich
haunt
the
fancy
and
warm
the
breast
of
youth
;
so
that
be
ignorant
of
her
danger
,
she
see
not
the
necessity
of
avoid
temptation
:
<EOS>
but
she
refuse
to
admit
a
man
into
her
bed
-
chamber
,
merely
because
it
be
a
step
altogether
opposite
to
the
form
and
decorum
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
far
from
be
discourage
by
this
repulse
,
he
know
her
fear
would
multiply
,
and
reduce
that
reluctance
,
which
,
in
order
to
weaken
,
he
have
recourse
to
another
piece
of
machinery
,
that
operate
powerfully
in
behalf
of
his
design
.
    
<EOS>
some
year
ago
,
a
twelve
string
instrument
be
contrive
by
a
very
ingenious
musician
,
by
whom
it
be
aptly
intitle
the
harp
of
Aeolus
,
because
,
be
properly
apply
to
a
stream
of
air
,
it
produce
a
wild
,
irregular
variety
of
harmonious
sound
,
that
seem
to
be
the
effect
of
inchantment
,
and
wonderfully
dispose
the
mind
for
the
most
romantic
situation
.
 
<EOS>
Fathom
,
who
be
really
a
virtuoso
in
musick
,
have
bring
one
of
those
new
fashionate
guittarre
into
the
country
,
and
as
the
effect
of
it
be
still
unknown
in
the
family
,
he
that
night
convert
it
to
the
purpose
of
his
amour
,
by
fix
it
in
the
casement
of
a
window
belong
to
the
gallery
,
expose
to
the
west
wind
,
which
then
blow
in
a
gentle
breeze
.
 
<EOS>
the
string
no
sooner
feel
the
impression
of
the
balmy
zephyr
,
than
they
begin
to
pour
forth
a
stream
of
melody
,
more
ravishingly
delightful
than
the
song
of
Philomel
,
the
warble
brook
,
and
all
the
concert
of
the
wood
.
 
<EOS>
the
soft
and
tender
note
of
peace
and
love
be
swell
up
with
the
most
delicate
and
insensible
transition
,
into
a
loud
hymn
of
triumph
and
exultation
,
join
by
the
deep
-
toned
organ
,
and
a
full
choir
of
voice
,
which
gradually
decay
upon
the
ear
,
until
it
die
away
,
in
distant
sound
,
as
if
a
flight
of
angel
have
raise
the
song
in
their
ascent
to
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
yet
the
chord
hardly
cease
to
vibrate
after
the
expiration
of
this
overture
,
which
usher
in
a
composition
in
the
same
pathetic
stile
;
and
this
again
be
succeed
by
a
third
,
almost
without
pause
or
intermission
,
as
if
the
artist
's
hand
have
be
indefatigable
,
and
the
theme
never
to
be
exhaust
.
    
<EOS>
His
heart
must
be
quite
callous
,
and
his
ear
lose
to
all
distinction
,
who
could
hear
such
harmony
without
emotion
;
how
deeply
then
must
it
have
affect
the
delicate
Celinda
,
whose
sensation
,
naturally
acute
,
be
whet
to
a
most
painful
keenness
,
by
her
apprehension
;
who
could
have
no
previous
idea
of
such
entertainment
,
and
be
credulous
enough
to
believe
the
most
improbable
tale
of
superstition
!
 
<EOS>
She
be
overwhelmed
with
awful
terror
,
and
never
doubt
that
the
sound
be
more
than
mortal
,
recommend
herself
to
the
care
of
providence
in
a
succession
of
pious
ejaculation
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
have
allow
some
time
for
the
effect
of
this
contrivance
,
repair
to
her
chamber
door
,
and
in
a
whisper
convey
thro
'
the
key
-
hole
,
ask
if
she
be
awake
,
begged
pardon
for
such
an
unseasonable
visit
,
and
desire
to
know
her
opinion
of
the
strange
musick
which
he
then
hear
.
 
<EOS>
in
spite
of
her
notion
of
decency
,
she
be
glad
of
his
intrusion
,
and
be
in
no
condition
to
observe
punctilio
,
slip
on
a
wrapper
,
open
the
door
,
and
with
a
faultere
voice
,
own
herself
frighten
almost
to
distraction
.
 
<EOS>
He
pretend
to
console
her
with
reflection
,
import
,
that
she
be
in
the
hand
of
a
benevolent
being
,
who
would
not
impose
upon
his
creature
any
task
which
they
could
not
bear
;
he
insist
upon
her
return
to
bed
,
and
assure
her
he
would
not
stir
from
her
chamber
till
day
.
    
<EOS>
thus
comfort
she
betook
herself
again
to
rest
,
while
he
sit
down
in
an
elbow
-
chair
at
some
distance
from
the
bed
-
side
,
and
in
a
soft
voice
begin
the
conversation
with
her
,
on
the
subject
of
those
visitation
from
above
,
which
though
undertake
on
pretence
of
dissipate
her
fear
and
anxiety
,
be
in
reality
calculate
for
the
purpose
of
augment
both
.
    
<EOS>
"
that
sweet
air
,
"
say
he
,
"
seem
design
for
soothe
the
bodily
anguish
of
some
saint
in
his
last
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Hark
!
<EOS>
how
it
rise
into
a
more
sprightly
and
elevated
strain
,
as
if
it
be
an
inspirit
invitation
to
the
realm
of
bliss
!
<EOS>
sure
he
be
now
absolve
from
all
the
misery
of
this
life
;
that
full
and
glorious
concert
of
voice
and
celestial
harp
,
betoken
his
reception
among
the
heavenly
choir
,
who
now
waft
his
soul
to
paradisian
joy
!
<EOS>
this
be
altogether
great
,
solemn
and
amazing
!
<EOS>
the
clock
strike
one
,
the
symphony
hath
cease
!
"
    
<EOS>
this
be
actually
the
case
;
for
,
he
have
order
Maurice
to
remove
the
instrument
at
that
hour
,
lest
the
sound
of
it
should
become
too
familiar
,
and
excite
the
curiosity
of
some
undaunte
domestic
,
who
may
frustrate
his
scheme
,
by
discover
the
apparatus
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
poor
Celinda
,
her
fancy
be
,
by
his
musick
and
discourse
,
work
up
to
the
high
pitch
of
enthusiastic
terror
;
the
whole
bed
shake
with
her
trepidation
,
the
awful
silence
that
succeed
the
supernatural
musick
,
throw
an
additional
damp
upon
her
spirit
,
and
the
artful
Fathom
affect
to
snore
at
the
same
time
,
she
could
no
longer
contain
her
horror
,
but
call
upon
his
name
with
a
fearful
accent
,
and
have
own
her
present
situation
insupportable
,
intreate
him
to
draw
near
her
bed
-
side
,
that
he
may
be
within
touch
,
on
any
emergency
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
a
welcome
request
to
our
adventurer
,
who
ask
pardon
for
his
drousiness
,
and
take
his
station
on
the
side
of
her
bed
,
exhort
her
to
compose
herself
;
then
lock
her
hand
fast
in
his
own
,
be
again
seize
with
such
an
inclination
to
sleep
,
that
he
gradually
sink
down
by
her
side
,
and
seem
to
enjoy
his
repose
in
that
attitude
.
 
<EOS>
mean
<EOS>
while
,
his
tender
-
hearted
mistress
,
that
he
may
not
suffer
in
his
health
,
by
his
humanity
and
complaisance
,
cover
him
with
the
counterpane
as
he
sleep
,
and
suffer
him
to
take
his
rest
,
without
interruption
:
till
he
think
proper
to
start
up
suddenly
,
with
an
exclamation
of
,
"
Heaven
watch
over
us
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
ask
with
symptom
of
astonishment
,
if
she
have
hear
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
such
an
abrupt
address
,
upon
such
an
occasion
do
not
fail
to
amaze
and
affright
the
gentle
Celinda
,
who
unable
to
speak
sprung
towards
her
treacherous
protector
;
and
he
catch
her
in
his
arm
,
bad
<EOS>
her
fear
nothing
;
for
he
would
,
at
the
expence
of
his
life
,
defend
her
from
all
danger
.
    
<EOS>
have
thus
,
by
tamper
with
her
weakneass
,
conquer
the
first
and
chief
obstacle
to
his
design
,
he
with
great
art
and
perseverance
improve
the
intercourse
to
such
a
degree
of
intimacy
as
could
not
but
be
productive
of
all
the
consequence
which
he
have
foresee
.
    
<EOS>
the
groans
and
musick
be
occasionally
repeat
so
as
to
alarm
the
whole
family
,
and
inspire
a
thousand
varous
conjecture
;
he
fail
not
to
continue
his
nocturnal
visit
and
ghastly
discourse
,
untill
his
attendance
become
so
necessary
to
this
unhappy
maiden
,
that
she
durst
not
stay
in
her
own
chamber
without
his
company
,
nor
even
sleep
,
except
in
contact
with
her
betrayer
.
    
<EOS>
such
a
commerce
between
two
such
person
of
a
different
sex
,
could
not
possibly
be
long
carry
on
,
without
degenerate
from
the
platonic
system
of
sentimental
love
.
 
<EOS>
in
her
paroxysm
of
dismay
,
he
do
not
forget
to
breathe
the
soft
inspiration
of
his
passion
,
to
which
she
listen
with
more
pleasure
,
as
they
divert
the
gloomy
idea
of
her
fear
;
and
by
this
time
his
extraordinary
accomplishment
have
make
a
conquest
of
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
what
therefore
could
be
a
more
interesting
transition
,
than
that
from
the
most
uneasy
to
the
most
agreeable
sensation
of
the
human
breast
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
the
case
,
the
reader
will
not
wonder
that
a
consummate
traitor
,
like
Fathom
,
should
triumph
over
the
virtue
of
an
artless
innocent
young
creature
,
whose
passion
he
have
entirely
under
his
command
.
 
<EOS>
the
gradation
towards
vice
be
almost
imperceptible
,
and
an
experienced
seducer
can
strew
them
with
such
inticing
and
agreeable
flower
,
as
will
lead
the
young
sinner
on
insensibly
,
even
to
the
most
profligate
stage
of
guilt
.
 
<EOS>
all
therefore
that
can
be
do
by
virtue
,
unassiste
with
experience
,
be
to
avoid
every
trial
with
such
a
formidable
foe
,
by
decline
and
discourage
the
first
advance
towards
a
particular
correspondence
with
perfidious
man
,
howsoever
agreeable
it
may
seem
to
be
:
for
,
here
<EOS>
,
be
no
security
but
in
conscious
weakness
.
    
<EOS>
Fathom
,
though
possess
of
the
spoil
of
poor
Celinda
's
honour
,
do
not
enjoy
his
success
with
tranquillity
.
    
<EOS>
Reflection
and
remorse
often
invade
her
in
the
midst
of
their
guilty
pleasure
,
and
embitter
all
those
moment
they
have
dedicate
to
mutual
bliss
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
seed
of
virtue
be
seldom
destroy
at
once
:
even
amidst
the
rank
production
of
vice
,
they
regerminate
to
a
sort
of
imperfect
vegetation
,
like
some
scatter
hyacinth
shoot
up
among
the
weed
of
a
ruin
garden
,
<EOS>
that
testify
the
former
culture
and
amenity
of
the
soil
:
she
sigh
at
the
sad
remembrance
of
that
virgin
dignity
which
she
have
lose
;
she
weep
at
the
prospect
of
that
disgrace
,
mortification
and
misery
she
should
undergo
,
when
abandon
by
this
transient
lover
,
and
severely
reproach
him
for
the
art
he
have
use
to
shipwreck
her
innocence
and
peace
.
    
<EOS>
such
expostulation
be
extremely
unseasonable
when
address
to
a
man
well
nigh
sate
with
the
effect
of
his
conquest
;
they
act
like
strong
blast
of
wind
apply
to
ember
almost
extinguish
,
which
,
instead
of
revive
the
flame
,
scatter
and
destroy
every
remain
particle
of
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
,
in
the
midst
of
his
peculiarity
,
have
inconstancy
in
common
with
the
rest
of
his
sex
.
 
<EOS>
More
than
half
cloy
with
the
possession
of
Celinda
,
he
could
not
fail
to
be
disgust
with
her
upbraiding
;
and
have
she
not
be
the
daughter
of
a
gentleman
whose
friendship
he
do
not
think
it
his
interest
to
forfeit
,
he
would
have
dropt
this
correspondence
without
reluctance
or
hesitation
:
but
,
as
he
have
measure
to
keep
with
a
family
of
such
consequence
,
he
constrain
his
inclination
so
far
,
as
to
counterfeit
those
rapture
he
no
longer
feel
,
and
find
mean
to
appease
those
intervene
tumult
of
her
grief
.
    
<EOS>
Foreseeing
,
however
,
that
it
would
not
be
always
in
his
power
to
console
her
on
these
term
;
he
resolve
,
if
possible
,
to
divide
her
affection
,
which
now
glow
upon
him
too
intensely
;
and
with
that
view
,
whenever
she
complain
of
the
vapour
or
dejection
,
he
prescribe
,
and
even
insist
upon
her
swallow
certain
cordial
of
the
most
palatable
composition
,
without
which
he
never
travel
;
and
these
produce
such
agreeable
reverie
and
flow
of
spirit
,
that
she
gradually
become
enamoured
of
intoxication
;
while
he
encourage
the
pernicious
passion
,
by
express
the
most
extravagant
applause
and
admiration
at
the
wild
,
irregular
sally
it
produce
.
 
<EOS>
without
have
first
make
this
diversion
,
he
would
have
find
it
impracticable
to
leave
the
house
in
tranquillity
;
but
when
this
betwitching
philtre
grow
into
an
habit
,
her
attachment
to
Ferdinand
be
insensibly
dissolve
;
she
begin
to
bear
his
neglect
with
indifference
,
and
sequestre
herself
from
the
rest
of
the
family
,
use
to
sollicit
this
new
ally
,
for
consolation
.
    
<EOS>
have
thus
put
the
finish
stroke
to
the
daughter
's
ruin
,
he
take
leave
of
the
father
with
many
acknowledgement
and
expression
of
gratitude
for
his
hospitality
and
friendship
,
and
ride
cross
the
country
to
Bristol
,
take
up
his
habitation
near
the
Hot
-
well
,
where
he
staid
during
the
remain
part
of
the
season
.
    
<EOS>
as
for
the
miserable
Celinda
,
she
become
more
and
more
addicted
to
the
vice
in
which
she
have
be
initiate
by
his
superlative
perfidy
and
craft
;
until
she
be
quite
abandon
by
decency
and
caution
:
her
father
's
heart
be
tear
with
anguish
,
while
his
wife
rejoice
in
her
fall
:
at
length
,
her
idea
be
quite
debase
by
her
infirmity
;
she
grow
every
day
more
and
more
sensual
and
degenerate
,
and
contract
an
intimacy
with
one
of
the
footman
,
who
be
kind
enough
to
take
her
to
wife
,
in
hope
of
obtain
a
good
settlement
from
his
master
;
but
be
disappoint
in
his
aim
,
he
conduct
her
to
London
,
where
he
make
shift
to
insinuate
himself
into
another
service
,
leave
to
her
,
the
use
,
and
partly
the
advantage
of
her
own
person
,
which
be
still
uncommonly
attractive
.
     
<EOS>
He
repair
to
Bristol
spring
,
where
he
reign
Paramount
during
the
whole
season
.
   
<EOS>
We
shall
therefore
leave
her
in
this
comfortable
situation
,
and
return
to
our
adventurer
,
whose
appearance
at
Bristol
be
consider
as
a
happy
oman
by
the
proprietor
of
the
hot
-
well
,
and
all
the
people
who
live
by
the
resort
of
company
to
that
celebrated
spring
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
they
deceive
in
their
prognostic
;
Fathom
,
as
usual
,
form
the
nucleus
or
kernel
of
the
beau
monde
;
and
the
season
soon
become
so
crouded
,
that
many
people
of
fashion
be
oblige
to
quit
the
place
for
want
of
lodging
.
 
<EOS>
Ferdinand
be
the
soul
that
animate
the
whole
society
.
 
<EOS>
He
not
only
invent
party
of
pleasure
,
but
also
,
by
his
personal
talent
,
render
them
more
agreeable
:
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
he
regulate
their
diversion
,
and
the
master
of
the
ceremony
never
would
allow
the
ball
to
be
begin
,
untill
the
count
be
seat
.
    
<EOS>
have
thus
make
himself
the
object
of
admiration
and
esteem
,
his
advice
be
an
oracle
to
which
they
have
recourse
in
all
doubtful
case
of
punctilio
or
dispute
,
or
even
of
medicine
;
for
among
his
other
accomplishment
,
his
discourse
on
that
subject
be
so
plausible
,
and
well
adapt
to
the
understanding
of
his
hearer
,
that
any
person
who
have
not
actually
study
the
medical
art
,
would
have
believe
he
be
inspire
by
the
spirit
of
Aesculapius
.
 
<EOS>
what
contribute
to
the
aggrandizement
of
his
character
in
this
branch
of
knowledge
,
be
a
victory
he
obtain
over
an
old
physician
,
who
ply
at
the
well
,
and
have
one
day
unfortunately
begin
to
harrangue
in
the
pump
-
room
,
upon
the
nature
of
the
Bristol
-
water
;
in
the
course
of
this
lecture
,
he
undertake
to
account
for
the
warmth
of
the
fluid
;
and
his
idea
be
perplex
with
a
great
deal
of
reading
,
which
he
have
not
be
able
to
digest
,
his
disquisition
be
so
indistinct
,
and
his
expression
so
obscure
and
unentertaining
,
that
our
hero
seize
the
opportunity
of
display
his
own
erudition
,
by
venture
to
contradict
some
circumstance
of
the
doctor
's
hypothesis
,
and
substitute
a
theory
of
his
own
,
which
,
as
he
have
invent
it
for
the
purpose
,
be
equally
amusing
and
chimerical
.
    
<EOS>
He
alledge
,
that
fire
be
the
sole
vivifying
principle
that
pervade
all
nature
;
that
as
the
heat
of
the
sun
concoct
the
juice
of
vegetable
and
ripen
those
fruit
that
grow
upon
the
surface
of
this
globe
,
there
be
likewise
an
immense
store
of
central
fire
reserve
within
the
bowel
of
the
earth
,
not
only
for
the
generation
of
gem
,
fossil
,
and
all
the
purpose
of
the
mineral
world
:
but
likewise
,
for
cherish
and
keep
alive
those
plant
which
would
otherwise
perish
by
the
winter
's
cold
.
 
<EOS>
the
existence
of
such
a
fire
,
he
prove
from
the
nature
of
all
those
volcano
,
which
in
almost
every
corner
of
the
earth
,
be
continually
vomit
up
either
flame
or
smoke
.
 
<EOS>
"
these
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
the
great
vent
appoint
by
nature
,
for
the
discharge
of
that
rarifie
air
,
and
combustible
matter
,
which
,
if
confine
,
would
burst
the
globe
asunder
;
but
besides
the
large
outlet
,
there
be
some
small
chimnie
through
which
part
of
the
heat
transpire
;
a
vapour
of
that
sort
,
I
conceve
,
must
pass
through
the
bed
or
channel
of
this
spring
,
the
water
of
which
,
accordingly
,
retain
a
moderate
warmth
.
"
    
<EOS>
this
account
,
which
totally
overthrow
the
other
's
doctrine
,
be
so
extremely
agreeable
to
the
audience
,
that
the
testy
doctor
lose
his
temper
,
and
give
them
to
understand
without
preamble
,
that
he
must
be
a
person
wholly
ignorant
of
natural
philosophy
,
who
could
invent
such
a
ridiculous
system
,
and
they
involve
in
bad
than
an
aegyptian
fog
,
that
could
not
at
once
discern
its
weakness
and
absurdity
.
 
<EOS>
this
declaration
introduce
a
dispute
,
which
be
unanimously
determine
in
favour
of
our
adventurer
.
    
<EOS>
on
all
such
occasion
,
the
stream
of
prejudice
run
against
the
physician
,
even
tho
'
<EOS>
his
antagonist
have
nothing
to
recommend
himself
to
the
favour
of
the
spectator
:
and
this
decision
depend
upon
diver
consideration
;
in
the
first
place
,
there
be
a
continual
war
carry
on
against
the
learned
profession
,
by
all
those
who
,
conscious
of
their
own
ignorance
,
seek
to
level
the
reputation
of
their
superior
,
with
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
secondly
,
in
all
dispute
upon
physic
,
that
happen
betwixt
<EOS>
a
person
who
really
understand
the
art
,
and
an
illiterate
pretender
,
the
argument
of
the
first
will
seem
obscure
and
unintelligible
to
those
who
be
unacquainted
with
the
previous
system
on
which
they
be
build
;
while
the
other
's
theory
,
derive
from
common
notion
,
and
superficial
observation
,
will
be
more
agreeable
,
because
better
adapt
to
the
comprehension
of
the
hearer
.
 
<EOS>
thirdly
,
the
judgment
of
the
multitude
be
apt
to
be
bias
by
that
surprize
,
which
be
the
effect
of
see
an
artist
foil
at
his
own
weapon
,
by
one
who
engage
him
only
for
amusement
.
    
<EOS>
Fathom
,
besides
these
advantage
,
be
bless
with
a
flow
of
language
,
an
elegant
address
,
a
polite
and
self
-
deny
stile
of
argumentation
,
together
with
a
temper
not
to
be
ruffle
;
so
that
the
victory
could
not
long
waver
between
him
and
the
physician
,
to
whom
he
be
infinitely
superior
in
every
acquisition
but
that
of
solid
learning
,
of
which
the
judge
have
no
idea
.
    
<EOS>
this
contest
be
not
only
glorious
,
but
profitable
to
our
adventurer
,
who
grow
into
such
request
in
his
medical
capacity
,
that
the
poor
doctor
be
utterly
desert
by
his
patient
,
and
Fathom
's
advice
sollicite
by
every
valetudinarian
in
the
place
;
nor
do
he
forfeit
the
character
he
thus
acquire
,
by
any
miscarriage
in
his
practice
;
be
but
little
conversant
with
the
Materia
medica
,
the
circle
of
his
prescription
be
very
small
:
his
chief
study
be
to
avoid
all
drug
of
rough
operation
,
and
uncertain
effect
;
and
to
administer
such
only
as
should
be
agreeable
to
the
palate
,
without
do
violence
to
the
constitution
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
physician
could
not
but
be
agreeable
to
people
of
all
disposition
;
and
as
most
of
the
patient
be
in
some
shape
hypochondriac
,
the
power
of
imagination
co
-
operating
with
his
remedy
,
often
effect
a
cure
.
    
<EOS>
on
the
whole
,
it
become
the
fashion
to
consult
the
count
in
all
distemper
,
and
his
reputation
would
have
have
its
run
,
though
the
death
of
every
patient
have
give
the
lie
to
his
pretension
.
 
<EOS>
but
empty
fame
be
not
the
sole
fruit
of
his
success
.
 
<EOS>
though
no
person
would
presume
to
affront
this
noble
graduate
with
a
fee
;
they
do
not
fail
to
manifest
their
gratitude
by
some
more
valuable
present
:
every
day
some
superb
piece
of
china
,
curious
snuff
-
box
or
jewel
be
press
upon
him
;
so
that
at
the
end
of
the
season
,
he
could
almost
have
furnish
a
toy
shop
,
with
the
acknowledgement
he
have
receive
:
not
only
his
avarice
but
his
pleasure
be
gratify
in
the
course
of
his
medical
administration
.
 
<EOS>
He
enjoy
free
access
,
egress
and
regress
,
with
all
the
female
at
the
well
,
and
no
matron
scruple
to
put
her
daughter
under
his
care
and
direction
.
 
<EOS>
these
opportunity
could
not
be
lose
upon
a
man
of
his
intriguing
genius
;
though
he
conduct
his
amour
with
such
discretion
,
that
during
the
whole
season
,
no
lady
's
character
suffer
on
his
account
:
yet
he
be
highly
fortunate
in
his
address
;
and
we
may
venture
to
affirm
,
that
the
reproach
of
barrenness
be
more
than
once
remove
by
the
vigour
of
his
endeavour
.
     
<EOS>
He
be
smite
with
the
charm
of
a
female
adventurer
,
whose
allurement
subject
him
to
a
new
vicissitude
of
fortune
.
   
<EOS>
among
those
who
be
distinguish
by
his
gallantry
,
be
the
young
wife
of
an
old
citizen
of
London
,
who
have
grant
her
permission
to
reside
at
the
Hot
-
well
for
the
benefit
of
her
health
,
under
the
eye
and
inspection
of
his
own
sister
,
who
be
a
maiden
of
fifty
year
.
 
<EOS>
the
pupil
,
whose
name
be
Mrs
Trapwell
,
though
low
in
stature
,
be
finely
shape
,
her
countenance
engage
,
though
her
complexion
be
brown
,
her
hair
in
colour
rival
the
raven
's
back
,
and
her
eye
emulate
the
lustre
of
the
diamond
.
    
<EOS>
Fathom
have
be
strike
with
her
first
appearance
;
but
find
it
impracticable
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
her
Duenna
,
so
as
to
make
a
declaration
of
his
flame
;
until
she
herself
guess
the
situation
of
his
thought
,
and
not
displeased
with
the
discovery
,
think
proper
to
furnish
him
with
the
opportunity
he
want
,
by
counterfeit
an
indisposition
,
for
the
cure
of
which
,
she
know
his
advice
would
be
implore
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
beginning
of
an
acquaintance
,
which
be
soon
improve
to
his
wish
;
and
so
well
do
she
manage
her
attraction
,
as
in
some
measure
to
fix
the
inconstancy
of
his
disposition
;
for
,
at
the
end
of
the
season
,
his
passion
be
not
sate
;
and
they
concert
the
mean
of
continue
their
commerce
,
even
after
their
return
to
London
.
    
<EOS>
this
intercourse
effectually
answer
the
purpose
of
the
husband
,
who
have
be
decoy
into
matrimony
,
by
the
cunning
of
his
spouse
,
whom
he
have
privately
keep
as
a
concubine
before
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
conscious
of
her
own
precarious
situation
,
she
have
resolve
to
impose
upon
the
infirmity
of
Trapwell
,
and
feign
herself
pregnant
,
give
him
to
understand
she
could
no
longer
conceal
her
condition
from
the
knowledge
of
her
brother
,
who
be
an
officer
in
the
army
,
and
of
such
violent
passion
,
that
should
he
once
discover
her
backsliding
,
he
would
undoubtedly
wipe
away
the
stain
of
his
family
-
dishonour
with
her
own
blood
,
as
well
as
that
of
her
keeper
.
 
<EOS>
the
citizen
,
to
prevent
such
a
catastrophe
,
take
her
to
wife
;
but
soon
after
perceive
the
trick
which
have
be
play
upon
him
,
set
his
invention
at
work
,
and
at
length
contrive
a
scheme
which
he
think
would
enable
him
;
not
only
to
retrieve
his
liberty
,
but
also
indemnify
himself
for
the
mortification
he
have
undergo
.
    
<EOS>
far
from
create
any
domestic
disturbance
,
by
upbraid
her
with
her
finesse
,
he
seem
perfectly
well
pleased
with
his
acquisition
;
and
as
he
know
her
void
of
any
principle
,
and
extremely
addicted
to
pleasure
,
he
choose
proper
occasion
to
insinuate
,
that
she
may
gratify
her
own
inclination
,
and
at
the
same
time
turn
her
beauty
to
good
account
.
 
<EOS>
She
joyfully
listen
to
these
remonstrance
,
and
in
consequence
of
their
mutual
agreement
,
she
repair
to
Bristol
-
spring
,
on
pretence
of
an
ill
state
of
health
,
accompany
by
her
sister
-
in
-
law
,
whom
they
do
not
think
proper
to
intrust
with
the
real
motive
of
her
journey
.
 
<EOS>
Fathom
's
person
be
agreeable
,
and
his
finance
suppose
to
be
in
flourish
order
;
therefore
,
she
select
him
from
the
herd
of
gallant
,
as
a
proper
sacrifice
to
the
power
which
she
adore
;
and
on
her
arrival
in
London
,
make
her
husband
acquaint
with
the
importance
of
her
conquest
.
    
<EOS>
Trapwell
overwhelm
her
with
caress
and
praise
for
her
discreet
and
dutiful
conduct
,
and
faithfully
promise
that
she
should
pocket
in
her
own
privy
purse
,
one
half
of
the
spoil
that
should
be
gather
from
her
gallant
,
whom
she
therefore
undertake
to
betray
,
after
he
have
swear
in
the
most
solemn
manner
,
that
his
intention
be
not
to
bring
the
affair
to
a
publick
trial
,
which
would
redound
to
his
own
disgrace
,
but
to
extort
a
round
sum
of
money
from
the
Count
,
by
way
of
composition
.
    
<EOS>
confide
in
this
protestation
,
she
,
in
a
few
day
,
give
him
intelligence
of
an
assignation
she
have
make
with
our
adventurer
,
at
a
certain
bagnio
near
Covent
garden
;
upon
which
he
secure
the
assistance
of
a
particular
friend
and
his
own
journeyman
,
with
whom
,
and
a
constable
,
he
repair
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
,
where
he
wait
in
an
adjoining
room
accord
to
the
direction
of
his
virtuous
spouse
,
until
she
make
the
preconcerte
signal
of
hem
three
time
aloud
,
when
he
and
his
associate
rush
into
the
chamber
,
and
surprise
our
hero
in
bed
with
his
inamorata
.
    
<EOS>
the
lady
,
on
this
occasion
,
act
her
part
to
a
miracle
;
she
scream
at
their
approach
;
and
after
an
exclamation
of
"
ruin
and
undone
!
"
<EOS>
faint
away
in
the
arm
of
her
spouse
,
who
have
by
this
time
seize
her
by
the
shoulder
,
and
begin
to
upbraid
her
with
her
infidelity
and
guilt
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
Fathom
,
his
affliction
be
unutterable
,
when
he
find
himself
discover
in
that
situation
,
and
make
prisoner
by
the
two
assistant
,
who
have
pinion
him
in
such
a
manner
,
that
he
could
not
stir
,
much
less
accomplish
an
escape
.
 
<EOS>
all
his
ingenuity
and
presence
of
mind
seem
to
forsake
him
in
this
emergency
.
 
<EOS>
the
horror
of
an
english
jury
overspread
his
imagnation
:
for
he
at
once
perceive
,
that
the
toil
into
which
he
have
fall
,
be
lay
for
the
purpose
;
consequently
he
take
it
for
grant
,
that
there
would
be
no
deficiency
in
point
of
evidence
.
 
<EOS>
soon
as
he
recollect
himself
,
he
beg
that
no
violence
may
be
offer
to
his
person
,
and
intreate
the
husband
to
favour
him
with
a
conference
,
in
which
the
affair
may
be
compromise
,
without
prejudice
to
the
reputation
of
either
.
    
<EOS>
at
first
,
Trapwell
breathe
nothing
but
implacable
revenge
,
but
by
the
persuasion
of
his
friend
,
after
he
have
send
home
his
wife
in
a
chair
,
he
be
prevail
upon
to
hear
the
proposal
of
the
delinquent
,
who
have
assure
him
,
by
way
of
apology
,
that
he
have
always
believe
the
lady
be
a
widow
,
make
him
an
offer
of
five
hundred
pound
,
as
an
atonement
for
the
injury
he
have
sustain
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
sum
no
way
adequate
to
the
expectation
of
the
citizen
,
who
look
upon
the
Count
as
possessor
of
an
immense
estate
,
he
reject
the
term
with
disdain
,
and
make
instant
application
to
a
judge
,
from
whom
he
obtain
a
warrant
for
secure
his
person
till
the
day
of
trial
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
in
this
case
,
money
be
but
a
secondary
consideration
with
Trapwell
,
whose
chief
aim
be
to
be
legally
divorce
from
a
woman
he
detest
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
there
be
no
remedy
for
the
unhappy
count
,
who
in
vain
offer
to
double
the
sum
:
he
find
himself
reduce
to
the
bitter
alternative
of
procure
immediate
bail
,
or
go
directly
to
Newgate
.
    
<EOS>
in
this
dilemma
he
send
a
messenger
to
his
friend
Ratchkali
,
whose
countenance
fall
when
he
understand
the
count
's
condition
:
nor
would
he
open
his
mouth
in
the
stile
of
consolation
,
until
he
have
consult
a
certain
solicitor
of
his
acquainance
,
who
assure
him
the
law
abound
with
such
resource
,
as
would
infallibly
screen
the
defendant
,
have
the
fact
be
still
more
palpable
than
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
there
be
great
presumption
to
believe
the
count
have
fall
a
sacrifice
to
a
conspiracy
,
which
by
some
mean
or
other
would
be
detect
;
and
in
that
case
,
the
plaintiff
may
obtain
one
shill
in
lieu
of
damage
.
    
<EOS>
if
that
dependance
should
fail
,
he
hint
,
that
,
in
all
probability
,
the
witness
be
not
incorruptible
;
or
should
they
prove
to
be
so
,
one
man
's
oath
be
as
good
as
another
be
,
and
thank
Heaven
!
<EOS>
there
be
no
dearth
of
evidence
,
provide
money
could
be
find
to
answer
the
necessary
occasion
.
    
<EOS>
Ratchkali
comfort
by
these
insinuation
,
and
dread
the
resentment
of
our
adventurer
,
who
in
his
despair
may
punish
him
severely
for
his
want
of
friendship
,
by
some
precipitate
explanation
of
the
commerce
they
have
carry
on
;
move
,
I
say
,
by
these
consideration
,
and
moreover
tempt
with
the
prospect
of
continue
to
reap
the
advantage
result
from
their
conjunction
,
he
,
and
another
person
of
credit
with
whom
he
largely
deal
in
jewel
,
condescend
to
become
surety
for
the
appearance
of
Fathom
,
who
be
accordingly
admit
to
bail
.
 
<EOS>
not
but
that
the
Tyroleze
know
Ferdinand
too
well
,
to
confide
in
his
parole
<EOS>
:
he
depend
chiefly
upon
his
idea
of
self
interest
,
which
,
he
think
,
would
persuade
him
to
risk
the
uncertain
issue
of
a
trial
,
rather
than
quit
the
field
before
the
harvest
be
half
over
;
and
he
resolve
to
make
his
own
retreat
without
ceremony
,
should
our
hero
be
unwise
enough
to
abandon
his
bail
.
    
<EOS>
such
an
adventure
could
not
long
lie
conceal
from
the
notice
of
the
public
,
even
if
both
party
have
be
at
pain
to
suppress
the
circumstance
:
but
the
plaintiff
,
far
from
seek
to
cover
,
affect
to
complain
loudly
of
his
misfortune
,
that
he
may
interest
his
neighbour
in
his
behalf
,
and
raise
a
spirit
of
rancour
and
animosity
,
to
influence
the
jury
against
this
insolent
foreigner
,
who
have
come
over
into
England
to
debauch
our
wife
,
and
deflower
our
daughter
:
while
he
employ
a
formidable
band
of
lawyer
to
support
the
indictment
,
which
he
lay
for
ten
thousand
pound
damage
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
Fathom
and
his
associate
do
not
fail
to
take
all
proper
measure
for
his
defence
;
they
retain
a
powerful
bar
of
council
,
and
the
solicitor
be
supply
with
one
hundred
pound
after
another
,
to
answer
the
expence
of
secret
service
;
still
assure
his
client
that
every
thing
be
in
an
excellent
train
,
and
that
his
adversary
would
gain
nothing
but
shame
and
confusion
of
face
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
there
be
a
necessity
for
postpone
the
trial
,
on
account
of
a
material
evidence
,
<EOS>
who
though
he
waver
,
be
not
yet
quite
bring
over
;
and
the
attorney
find
mean
to
put
off
the
decision
from
term
to
term
,
until
there
be
no
quibble
leave
for
further
delay
.
 
<EOS>
while
this
suit
be
depend
,
our
hero
continue
to
move
in
his
usual
sphere
;
nor
do
the
report
of
his
situation
at
all
operate
to
his
disadvantage
,
in
the
polite
world
:
 
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
it
add
a
fresh
plume
to
his
character
,
in
the
eye
of
all
those
who
be
not
before
acquaint
with
the
triumph
of
his
gallantry
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
countenance
of
his
friend
,
he
himself
consider
the
affair
in
a
very
serious
light
;
and
perceive
that
at
any
rate
he
must
be
a
considerable
loser
,
he
resolve
to
double
his
assiduity
in
trade
,
that
he
may
be
the
more
able
to
afford
the
extraordinary
expence
to
which
he
be
subject
.
 
<EOS>
{
chapter_37
}
        
the
reader
may
have
observe
,
that
Fathom
with
all
his
circumspection
,
have
a
weak
side
,
which
expose
him
to
sundry
mischance
:
this
be
his
covetousness
,
which
on
some
occasion
become
too
hard
for
his
discretion
:
at
this
period
of
time
,
it
be
,
by
the
circumstance
of
his
situation
,
inflame
to
a
degree
of
rapacity
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
now
prevail
upon
to
take
a
hand
at
whist
or
piquet
,
and
even
to
wield
the
hazard
box
;
though
he
have
hitherto
declare
himself
an
irrecondileable
enemy
to
all
sort
of
play
,
and
so
uncommon
be
his
success
and
dexterity
at
these
exercise
,
as
to
surprize
his
acquaintance
,
and
arouse
the
suspicion
of
some
people
,
who
repine
at
his
prosperity
.
    
<EOS>
but
in
nothing
be
his
conduct
more
inexcusable
,
than
in
give
way
to
the
dangerous
temerity
of
Ratchkali
,
which
he
have
be
always
at
pain
to
restrain
,
and
permit
him
to
practise
the
same
fraud
upon
an
english
nobleman
;
which
have
be
execute
upon
himself
at
Franckfort
.
    
<EOS>
in
other
word
,
the
Tyroleze
by
the
canal
of
Ferdinand
's
finger
and
recommendation
,
sell
a
pebble
for
a
real
brilliant
,
and
in
a
few
day
the
cheat
be
discover
,
to
the
infinite
confusion
of
our
adventurer
,
who
nevertheless
assume
the
guise
of
innocence
with
so
much
art
,
and
express
such
indignation
against
the
villain
who
have
impose
upon
his
judgment
and
unsuspecting
generosity
,
that
his
lordship
acquit
him
of
any
share
in
the
deceit
and
content
himself
with
the
restitution
,
which
he
insist
upon
make
out
of
his
own
pocket
,
until
he
should
be
able
to
apprehend
the
rogue
,
who
have
think
proper
to
abscond
for
his
own
safety
.
 
<EOS>
in
spite
of
all
this
exculpation
,
his
character
do
not
fail
to
retain
a
sort
of
stigma
,
which
indeed
the
plain
proof
of
innocence
be
hardly
able
to
efface
;
and
his
connexion
with
such
a
palpable
knave
as
the
Tyroleze
appear
to
be
,
have
an
effect
to
his
prejudlce
,
in
the
mind
of
all
those
who
be
privy
to
the
occurrence
.
    
<EOS>
when
a
man
's
reputation
be
once
bring
in
question
,
every
trifle
be
,
by
the
malevolence
of
mankind
,
magnify
into
a
strong
presumption
against
the
culprit
:
a
few
whisper
communicate
by
the
envious
mouth
of
slander
,
which
he
can
have
no
opportunity
to
answer
and
refute
,
shall
,
in
the
opinion
of
the
world
,
convict
him
of
the
most
horrid
crime
,
and
for
one
hypocrite
who
be
deck
with
the
honour
of
virtue
,
there
be
twenty
good
man
who
suffer
the
ignominy
of
vice
;
so
well
disposed
be
individual
to
trample
upon
the
fame
of
their
fellow
-
creature
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
most
unblemished
merit
be
not
protect
from
this
injustice
,
it
will
not
be
wonder
at
,
that
no
quarter
be
give
to
the
character
of
an
adventurer
like
Fathom
,
who
among
other
unlucky
occurrence
,
have
the
misfortune
to
be
recognize
about
this
time
,
by
his
two
parisian
friend
Sir
Stentor
Stiles
and
Sir
Giles
Squirrel
.
    
<EOS>
these
worthy
knight
-
errant
have
return
to
their
own
country
,
after
have
make
a
very
prosperous
campaign
in
France
,
at
the
end
of
which
,
however
,
they
very
narrowly
escape
the
gaillie
;
and
see
the
polish
count
seat
at
the
head
of
taste
and
politeness
,
they
immediately
circulate
the
story
of
his
defeat
at
Paris
,
with
many
ludicrous
circumstance
of
their
own
invention
,
and
do
not
scruple
to
affirm
that
he
be
a
rank
imposter
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
laugh
be
raise
upon
a
great
man
,
he
never
fail
to
dwindle
into
contempt
.
 
<EOS>
Ferdinand
begin
to
perceive
a
change
in
the
countenance
of
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
His
company
be
no
longer
solicit
with
that
eagerness
which
they
have
formerly
express
in
his
behalf
:
even
his
entertainment
be
neglect
;
when
he
appear
at
any
private
or
public
assembly
,
the
lady
,
instead
of
glow
with
pleasure
as
formerly
,
now
titter
or
regard
him
with
look
of
disdain
;
and
a
certain
pert
,
little
,
forward
coquette
,
with
a
view
to
put
him
out
of
countenance
by
raise
the
laugh
at
his
expence
,
ask
him
one
night
,
at
a
drum
,
when
he
have
hear
from
his
relation
in
Poland
?
 
<EOS>
She
succeed
in
her
design
upon
the
mirth
of
the
audience
,
but
be
disappoint
in
the
other
part
of
her
aim
;
for
our
hero
reply
without
the
least
mark
of
discomposure
,
"
They
be
all
in
good
health
at
your
service
,
madam
;
I
wish
I
know
in
what
part
of
the
world
your
relation
reside
,
that
I
may
return
the
compliment
.
"
 
<EOS>
by
this
answer
,
which
be
the
more
severe
,
as
the
young
lady
be
of
very
doubtful
extraction
,
he
retort
the
laugh
upon
the
aggressor
,
though
he
likewise
fail
in
his
attempt
upon
her
temper
;
for
she
be
perhaps
the
only
person
present
,
who
equall'd
himself
in
stability
of
countenance
.
    
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
appearance
of
unconcern
,
he
be
deeply
touch
with
these
mark
of
alienation
,
in
the
behaviour
of
his
friend
,
and
foresee
in
his
own
disgrace
,
the
total
shipwreck
of
his
fortune
,
be
enter
into
a
melancholy
deliberation
with
himself
,
about
the
mean
of
retrieve
his
importance
in
the
beau
-
monde
,
or
of
turn
his
address
into
some
other
channel
,
where
he
could
stand
upon
a
less
slippery
foundation
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
exercise
of
his
thought
,
no
scheme
occur
more
feasible
,
than
that
of
secure
the
booty
he
have
make
,
and
retire
with
his
associate
,
who
be
also
blow
,
into
some
other
country
,
where
,
their
name
and
character
be
unknown
,
they
may
pursue
their
old
plan
of
commerce
without
molestation
.
 
<EOS>
He
impart
this
suggestion
to
the
Tyroleze
,
who
approve
the
proposal
of
decamping
,
though
he
combat
with
all
his
may
our
hero
's
inclination
to
withdraw
himself
before
the
trial
,
by
repeat
the
assurance
of
the
solicitor
,
who
tell
him
he
may
depend
upon
be
reimburse
by
the
sentence
of
the
court
,
for
great
part
of
the
sum
he
have
expend
in
the
course
of
the
prosecution
.
    
<EOS>
Fathom
suffer
himself
to
be
persuade
by
these
argument
,
support
with
the
desire
of
make
an
honourable
retreat
,
and
wait
patiently
for
the
day
of
trial
,
discharge
his
surety
,
by
a
personal
appearance
in
court
.
 
<EOS>
yet
this
be
not
the
only
score
he
discharge
that
morning
;
the
solicitor
present
his
own
bill
before
they
set
out
for
Westminster
-
hall
,
and
give
the
count
to
understand
that
it
be
the
custom
,
from
time
immemorial
,
for
the
client
to
clear
with
his
attorney
before
trial
.
 
<EOS>
Ferdinand
have
nothing
to
object
against
this
establish
rule
,
though
he
look
upon
it
as
a
bad
oman
,
in
spite
all
the
solicitor
's
confidence
and
protestation
;
and
he
be
not
a
little
confounded
,
when
look
into
the
content
,
he
find
himself
charge
with
350
attendance
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
it
be
not
his
interest
to
disoblige
his
lawyer
at
such
a
juncture
;
neverthless
,
he
could
not
help
expostulate
with
him
on
this
article
,
which
seem
to
be
so
falsly
state
with
regard
to
the
number
,
when
his
question
draw
on
an
explanation
,
by
which
he
find
he
have
incur
the
penalty
of
three
shilling
and
four
-
pence
for
every
time
he
chance
to
meet
the
conscientious
attorney
either
in
the
park
,
the
coffee
-
house
,
or
the
street
,
provide
they
have
exchange
the
common
salutation
:
and
he
have
great
reason
to
believe
the
solicitor
have
often
throw
himself
in
his
way
,
with
a
view
to
swell
this
item
of
his
account
.
    
<EOS>
with
this
extortion
our
adventurer
be
fain
to
comply
,
because
he
lie
at
the
mercy
of
the
caitiff
;
accordingly
,
he
with
a
good
grace
pay
the
demand
,
which
,
include
his
former
disbursement
,
amount
to
three
hundred
and
fifty
-
five
pound
eleven
shilling
three
penny
three
farthing
,
and
then
present
himself
before
the
judge
,
quietly
submit
to
the
law
of
the
realm
.
    
<EOS>
His
council
behave
like
man
of
consummate
ability
in
their
profession
;
they
exert
themselves
with
equal
industry
,
eloquence
and
erudition
,
in
their
endeavour
to
perplex
the
truth
,
browbeat
the
evidence
,
puzzle
the
judge
,
and
mislead
the
jury
:
but
the
defendant
find
himself
woefully
disappointed
in
the
deposition
of
Trapwell
's
journeyman
,
whom
the
solicitor
pretend
to
have
convert
to
his
interest
:
this
witness
,
as
the
attorney
afterwards
declare
,
play
booty
,
and
the
fact
come
out
so
clear
,
that
Ferdinand
Count
Fathom
be
convict
of
criminal
conversation
with
the
plaintiff
's
wife
,
and
cast
in
fifteen
hundred
pound
,
under
the
denomination
of
damage
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
not
so
much
surprize
as
afflict
at
this
decision
,
because
he
see
it
gradually
approach
from
the
examination
of
the
first
evidence
:
his
thought
be
now
employ
in
cast
about
for
some
method
of
deliverance
,
from
the
snare
in
which
he
find
himself
entangle
.
 
<EOS>
to
escape
he
foresee
it
would
be
impracticable
,
as
Trapwell
would
undoubtedly
be
prepare
for
arrest
him
before
he
could
quit
Westminster
hall
;
he
be
too
well
acquaint
with
Ratchkali
's
principle
,
to
expect
any
assistance
from
that
quarter
,
in
money
-
matter
;
and
he
be
utterly
averse
to
the
payment
of
the
sum
award
against
him
,
which
would
have
exhaust
his
whole
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
resolve
to
try
the
friendship
of
some
person
of
fashon
,
with
whom
he
have
maintain
an
intimacy
of
correspondence
;
should
they
fail
him
in
the
day
of
his
necessity
,
he
propose
to
have
recourse
to
his
former
surety
,
one
of
whom
he
mean
to
bilk
,
while
the
other
may
accompany
him
in
his
retreat
;
or
,
should
both
these
expedient
miscarry
,
he
determine
,
rather
than
part
with
his
effect
,
to
undergo
the
most
disagreeable
confinement
,
in
hope
of
obtain
the
jailor
's
connivance
at
his
escape
,
    
these
resolution
be
take
,
he
meet
his
fate
with
great
fortitude
and
equanimity
,
and
calmly
suffer
himself
to
be
convey
to
the
house
of
a
sheriff
's
officer
,
who
,
as
he
make
his
exit
from
the
hall
,
accord
to
his
own
expectation
,
execute
a
writ
against
him
,
at
the
suit
of
Trapwell
,
for
a
debt
of
two
thousand
pound
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
place
he
be
follow
by
his
solicitor
,
who
be
allure
by
the
prospect
of
another
job
,
and
who
,
with
great
demonstration
of
satisfaction
,
congratulate
him
upon
the
happy
issue
of
the
trail
;
arrogate
to
himself
the
merit
of
have
save
him
eight
thousand
pound
,
in
the
article
of
damage
,
by
the
previous
step
he
have
take
,
and
the
noble
defence
that
he
and
his
friend
the
council
have
make
for
their
client
:
he
even
hint
an
expectation
of
receive
a
gratuity
for
his
extraordinary
care
and
discretion
.
    
<EOS>
Fathom
,
gall
as
he
be
with
his
misfortune
,
and
enrage
at
the
effrontery
of
this
pettifogger
,
maintain
a
serenity
of
countenance
,
and
send
the
attorney
with
a
message
to
the
plaintiff
,
import
,
that
as
he
be
a
foreigner
,
and
could
not
be
suppose
to
have
so
much
cash
about
him
,
as
to
spare
fifteen
hundred
pound
from
the
fund
of
his
ordinary
expence
,
he
would
grant
him
a
bond
payable
in
two
month
,
during
which
period
,
he
should
be
able
to
procure
a
proper
remittance
from
his
own
estate
.
 
<EOS>
while
the
solicitor
be
employ
in
this
negociation
,
he
dispatch
his
valet

to
one
nobleman

Maurice
to
another

with
billet

signify
the
nature
of
the
verdict

his
adversary
have
obtain

desire
that
each
would
lend
him
a
thousand
pound
upon
his
parole

he
could
negotiate
bill
upon

continent

His
three
messenger
return
almost
at
the
same
instant
of
time
,
and
these
be
the
answer
they
bring
back
.

Trapwell
absolutely
reject
his

threatne
him
with
all
the
horror
of

an
expence
which
,
in
his
opinion
,
the
finance

remonstrance

visit

produce

throw
him
into
such
agony
of
apprehension

he
have
never

He
remember
the
former
desertion

intreate

the

not
run
any

five

under
pretence

a
broker

live

neighbourhood

so
long

trench

the

that
extend
from
the

head

almost
to
the
upper
part
of
the
nose

upon
each
side
of
which
it
discharge
a
sanguine
stream

<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
pain
of
this
application
,
the
sollicitor
be
transport
with
joy
at
the
sense
of
the
smart

and
inwardly
congratulate
himself
upon
the
appearance
of
his
own
blood

which
he
no
sooner
perceive
,
than
he
exclaim
,
"
I
be
a
dead
man
,
"
and
fall
upon
the
floor
at
full
length
.
    
<EOS>
Immediate
recourse
be
have
to
a
surgeon
in
the
neighbourhood
,
who
have
examine
the
wound
,
declare
there
be
a
dangerous
depression
of
the
first
table
of
the
skull
,
and
that
if
he
could
save
the
patient
's
life
,
without
the
application
of
the
trepan
,
it
would
be
one
of
the
great
cure
that
ever
be
perform
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
Fathom
's
first
transport
be
over
blow
,
he
summon
up
his
whole
resolution
,
and
reflect
upon
his
own
ruin
,
with
that
fortitude
which
have
never
fail
him
in
the
emergency
of
his
fate
:
little
disturb
at
the
prognostic
of
the
surgeon
,
which
he
consider
in
the
right
point
of
view
:
    
"
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
be
not
so
unacquainted
with
the
resistance
of
an
attorney
's
skull
,
at
to
believe
the
chastisment
I
have
bestow
on
him
,
will
at
all
endanger
his
life
,
which
be
in
much
great
jeopardy
from
the
hand
of
the
common
executioner
;
for
,
notwithstanding
this
accident
,
I
be
determined
to
prosecute
the
rascal
for
robbery
,
with
the
utmost
severity
of
the
law
;
and
that
I
may
have
a
sufficient
fund
leave
for
that
prosecution
,
I
shall
not
at
present
throw
away
one
farthing
in
unnecessary
expence
,
but
insist
upon
be
convey
to
prison
without
farther
delay
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
this
declaration
be
equally
unwelcome
to
the
bailiff
,
surgeon
and
sollicitor
,
who
upon
the
supposition
that
the
count
be
a
person
of
fortune
,
and
would
rather
part
with
an
immense
sum
,
than
incur
the
ignominy
of
a
goal
,
or
involve
himself
in
another
disgraceful
law
suit
,
<EOS>
have
resolve
to
fleece
him
to
the
utmost
of
their
power
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
now
the
attorney
find
him
determine
to
set
his
fate
at
defiance
,
and
to
retort
upon
him
a
prosecution
which
he
have
no
mind
to
undergo
,
begin
to
repent
heartily
of
the
provocation
he
have
give
,
and
to
think
seriously
on
some
method
to
overcome
the
obstinacy
of
the
incensed
foreigner
.
 
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
while
the
bailiff
conduct
him
to
bed
,
in
another
apartment
,
he
desire
the
catchpole
to
act
the
part
of
mediator
between
him
and
the
count
,
and
furnish
him
with
proper
instruction
for
that
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
accordingly
,
the
landlord
on
his
return
,
tell
Fathom
that
he
be
sure
the
sollicitor
be
not
a
man
for
this
world
;
for
that
he
have
leave
him
deprive
of
his
sense
,
and
pray
to
God
with
great
devotion
,
for
mercy
to
his
murderer
:
<EOS>
he
then
exhort
him
,
with
many
protestation
of
friendship
,
to
compromise
the
unhappy
affair
,
by
exchange
release
with
the
attorney
before
his
delirium
should
be
know
,
otherwise
he
would
bring
himself
into
a
most
dangerous
premunire
,
whither
the
plaintiff
should
die
of
his
wound
,
or
live
to
prosecute
him
for
the
assault
:
"
and
with
regard
to
your
charge
of
robbery
against
him
,
say
he
,
as
it
be
no
more
than
a
bare
suspicion
,
unsupporte
by
the
least
shadow
of
evidence
,
the
bill
would
be
throw
out
,
and
then
he
may
sue
you
for
damage
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
,
out
of
pure
friendship
and
good
nature
,
advise
you
to
compromise
the
affair
,
and
if
you
think
proper
,
will
endeavour
to
bring
about
a
mutual
release

<EOS>
Our

,
whose

be
by
this

pretty
well
cooled

see
reason
for
assent
to
the
proposal

upon
which
the
deed
be
immediately
execute
,
the

bill
be

he
see
himself

in
the
course
of
a
few
hour
,
deprive
of
his

Sir
Mungo
Barebones
may
have
some
hasty

small
beer

though
I
do
not

no
more

to

the
eighteen

I
lay
out
for

<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
he
be
a
quiet
sort
of
a
body
,
and
a
great
scholar
,
and
it
be
a
scandal
to
the
place

to
see
him
go
about
in
that
naked
condition

<EOS>
as
for

so
much

you

send
you
back

among
your

I
will
teach
him
to
draw
his
sword
upon
the
governor
of
an
English
county
goal

<EOS>
what

<EOS>
I
suppose
he

he
have
to

with
a
french

<EOS>
he
shall
eat
his

"
    
<EOS>
although
our
adventurer
be
very
little
disposed
,
at
this
juncture
,
to
make
observation
foreign
to
his
own
affair
,
he
could
not
help
take
notice
of
these
extraordinary
injunction
;
especially
those
concern
the
person
who
be
intitle
King
,
whom
,
however
,
he
suppose
to
be
some
prisoner
elect
as
the
magistrate
by
the
joint
suffrage
of
his
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
have
take
possession
of
his
chamber
,
which
he
rent
at
five
shilling
a
week
,
and
be
ill
at
ease
in
his
own
thought
<EOS>
,
he
forthwith
secure
his
door
,
undressed
and
go
to
bed
,
in
which
,
though
it
be
none
of
the
most
elegant
or
invite
couch
,
he
enjoy
profound
repose
after
the
accumulate
fatigue
and
mortification
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
next
morning
after
breakfast
,
the
keeper
enter
his
apartment
,
and
give
him
to
understand
,
that
the
gentleman
under
his
care
,
have
hear
of
the
count
's
arrival
,
have
depute
one
of
their
number
to
wait
upon
him
with
the
compliment
of
condolance
,
suitable
to
the
occasion
,
and
invite
him
to
become
a
member
of
their
society
.
 
<EOS>
Our
hero
could
not
politely
dispence
with
this
instance
of
civility
,
and
their
ambassador
be
instantly
introduce
by
the
name
of
captain
Minikin
,
salute
him
with
great
solemnity
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
a
person
equally
remarkable
for
his
extraordinary
figure
and
address
;
his
age
seem
to
border
upon
forty
,
his
stature
amount
to
five
foot
,
his
visage
be
long
,
meagre
and
weather
beat
,
and
his
aspect
,
though
not
quite
rueful
,
exhibit
a
certain
formality
,
which
be
the
result
of
care
and
conscious
importance
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
very
little
encumbre
with
flesh
and
blood
;
yet
,
what
body
he
have
,
be
well
proportion
,
his
limb
be
elegantly
turn
,
and
by
his
carriage
he
be
well
intitle
to
that
compliment
which
we
pay
to
any
person
,
when
we
say
he
have
very
much
the
air
of
a
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
also
an
evident
singularity
in
his
dress
,
which
tho
'
intend
as
an
improvement
,
appear
to
be
an
extravagant
exaggeration
of
the
mode
,
and
at
once
evince
him
an
original
to
the
discern
eye
of
our
adventurer
,
who
receive
him
with
his
usual
complaisance
,
and
make
a
very
eloquent
acknowledgment
of
the
honour
and
satisfaction
he
receive
from
the
visit
of
the
representative
,
and
the
hospitality
of
his
constituent
.
 
<EOS>
the
captain
's
peculiarity
be
not
confine
to
his
external
appearance
;
for
his
voice
resemble
the
sound
of
a
bassoon
,
or
the
aggregate
hum
of
a
whole
bee
-
hive
,
and
his
discourse
be
almost
nothing
else
than
a
series
of
quotation
from
the
english
poet
,
interlard
with
french
phrase
,
which
he
retain
for
their
significance
,
on
the
recommendation
of
his
friend
,
be
himself
unacquainted
with
that
or
any
other
outlandish
tongue
.
    
<EOS>
Fathom
find
this
gentleman
of
a
very
communicative
disposition
,
think
he
could
not
have
a
fair
opportunity
of
learn
the
history
of
his
fellow
-
prisoner
;
and
turn
the
conversation
on
that
subject
,
be
not
disappoint
in
his
expectation
.
    
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
doubt
,
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
with
the
utmost
solemnity
of
declamation
,
"
but
you
look
with
horror
upon
every
object
that
surround
you
in
this
uncomfortable
place
;
but
nevertheless
here
be
some
,
who
,
as
my
friend
Shakespear
have
it
,
have
see
well
day
,
and
have
with
holy
bell
be
knolle
to
church
;
and
sit
at
good
man
's
feast
,
and
wipe
their
eye
of
drop
that
sacred
pity
hath
engender
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
Sir
,
that
exclusive
of
the
Canaille
,
or
the
profanum
Vulgus
,
as
they
be
stile
by
Horace
,
there
be
several
small
community
in
the
goal
,
consist
of
people
who
be
attract
by
the
manner
and
disposition
of
each
other
:
for
this
place
,
Sir
,
be
quite
a
microcosm
and
as
the
great
world
,
so
be
this
a
stage
,
and
all
the
man
and
woman
merely
player
.
 
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
Sir
,
I
have
always
make
it
a
maxim
to
associate
with
the
good
company
I
can
find
:
<EOS>
not
that
I
pretend
to
boast
of
my
family
or
extraction
;
because
you
know
,
as
the
poet
say
,
Vix
ea
nostra
voco
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
,
'
tis
true
,
be
a
man
that
pique
himself
upon
his
pedigree
as
well
as
upon
his
politesse
and
personal
merit
;
for
he
have
be
a
very
old
officer
in
the
army
,
and
I
myself
may
say
,
I
be
bear
with
a
spontoon
in
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
have
have
the
honour
to
serve
his
majesty
these
twenty
year
,
and
have
be
bandy
about
in
the
course
of
duty
,
through
all
the
british
plantation
,
and
you
see
the
recompence
of
all
my
service
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
a
disagreeable
subject
,
and
therefore
I
shall
wave
it
:
however
,
as
Butler
observe
,
    
<EOS>
"
My
only
comfort
be
,
that
now
,
 
My
dubbolt
fortune
be
so
low
,
 
that
either
it
must
quickly
end
,
 
or
turn
about
again
and
mend
.
"
    
<EOS>
and
now
to
return
from
this
digression
,
you
will
perhaps
be
surprize
to
hear
that
the
head
or
chairman
of
our
club
be
really
a
sovereign
prince
.
    
<EOS>
no
less
I
will
assure
you
than
the
celebrated
Theodore
king
of
Corsica
,
who
lie
in
prison
for
a
debt
of
a
few
hundred
pound
.
    
<EOS>
Heu
!
<EOS>
quantum
mutatus
ab
illo
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
my
business
to
censure
the
conduct
of
my
superior
:
<EOS>
but
I
always
speak
my
mind
in
a
cavalier
manner
,
and
as
,
accord
to
the
Spectator
,
talk
to
a
friend
<EOS>
be
no
more
than
think
aloud
<EOS>
,
entre
nous
,
his
corsican
majesty
have
be
scurvily
treat
by
a
certain
administration
:
be
that
as
it
will
,
he
be
a
personage
of
a
very
portly
appearance
,
and
be
quite
master
of
the
beinseance
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
they
will
find
it
their
interest
to
have
recourse
again
to
his
alliance
:
and
in
that
case
,
some
of
us
may
expect
to
profit
by
his
restoration
:
but
few
word
be
good
.
    
<EOS>
He
<EOS>
that
maintain
the
second
rank
in
our
assembly
,
be
one
major
Macleaver
,
an
irish
gentleman
,
who
have
serve
abroad
:
a
soldier
of
fortune
,
Sir
,
a
man
of
unquestionable
honour
and
courage
;
but
a
little
over
-
bearing
,
in
consequence
of
his
knowledge
and
experience
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
person
of
a
good
address
to
be
sure
,
and
quite
free
of
the
mauvaise
honte
;
and
he
may
have
see
a
good
deal
of
service
;
but
what
then
?
<EOS>
other
people
may
be
as
good
as
he
,
though
they
have
not
have
such
opportunity
:
if
he
speak
five
or
six
language
,
he
do
not
pretend
to
any
taste
in
the
liberal
art
,
which
be
the
criterion
of
an
accomplished
gentleman
.
    
<EOS>
the
next
be
Sir
Mungo
Barebones
,
the
representative
of
a
very
ancient
family
in
the
North
;
his
affair
be
very
much
derange'e
,
but
he
be
a
gentleman
of
great
probity
and
learning
,
and
at
present
engag'd
<EOS>
in
a
very
grand
scheme
,
which
,
if
he
can
bring
it
to
bear
,
will
render
him
famous
to
all
posterity
:
<EOS>
no
less
than
the
conversion
of
the
Jews
and
the
Gentiles
.
 
<EOS>
the
project
,
I
own
,
look
chimerical
to
one
who
have
not
converse
with
the
author
;
but
,
in
my
opinion
,
he
have
clearly
demonstrate
from
an
anagrammatical
analysis
of
a
certain
hebrew
word
,
that
his
present
majesty
,
whom
God
preserve
,
be
the
person
point
at
in
scripture
,
as
the
temporal
Messiah
of
the
Jews
;
and
if
he
could
once
raise
by
subscription
,
such
a
trifling
sum
as
twelve
hundred
thousand
pound
,
I
make
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
he
would
accomplish
his
aim
,
vast
and
romantic
as
it
seem
to
be
.
    
<EOS>
besides
these
,
we
have
another
messmate
,
who
be
a
french
chevalier
,
an
odd
sort
of
a
man
,
a
kind
of
Lazarillo
de
Tormes
,
a
Caricatura
;
he
wear
a
long
beard
,
pretend
to
be
a
great
poet
,
and
make
a
damned
Fracas
with
his
verse
.
 
<EOS>
the
king
have
be
oblige
to
exert
his
authority
over
him
more
than
once
,
by
order
him
into
close
confinement
,
for
which
he
be
so
rash
as
to
send
his
majesty
a
challenge
;
but
he
afterwards
make
his
submission
,
and
be
again
take
into
favour
:
the
truth
be
,
I
believe
his
brain
be
a
little
disorder
,
and
he
be
a
stranger
we
overlook
his
extravagancy
.
    
<EOS>
Sir
,
we
shall
think
ourselves
happy
in
your
accession
to
our
society
:
you
will
be
under
no
sort
of
restraint
:
for
though
we
dine
at
one
table
,
every
individual
call
and
pay
for
his
own
mess
.
    
<EOS>
Our
conversation
,
such
as
it
be
,
will
not
,
I
hope
,
be
disagreeable
;
and
though
we
have
not
opportunity
of
breathe
the
pure
arcadian
air
,
and
can
not
"
under
the
shade
of
melancholy
bough
,
lose
and
neglect
the
creep
hour
of
time
;
"
we
may
enjoy
ourselves
over
a
glass
of
punch
or
a
dish
of
tea
:
nor
be
we
destitute
of
friend
who
visit
us
in
these
shade
of
distress
.
 
<EOS>
the
major
have
a
numerous
acquaintance
of
both
sex
,
among
other
,
a
first
cousin
of
good
fortune
,
who
with
her
daughter
often
chear
our
solitude
;
she
be
a
very
sensible
lady
-
like
gentlewoman
,
and
the
young
lady
have
a
certain
degage'e
air
,
that
plainly
shew
they
have
see
the
good
company
:
besides
,
I
will
venture
to
recommend
Mrs
Minikin
,
as
a
woman
of
tolerable
breeding
and
capacity
,
who
,
I
hope
,
will
not
be
find
altogether
deficient
in
the
accomplishment
of
the
sex
.
 
<EOS>
so
that
we
find
mean
to
make
little
party
,
in
which
the
time
glide
away
insensibly
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
have
a
small
collection
of
book
,
which
be
at
your
service
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
amuse
yourself
with
Shakespear
,
or
Milton
,
or
Don
Quixote
,
or
any
of
our
modern
author
that
be
worth
reading
,
such
as
the
adventure
of
Loveill
,
Lady
Frail
,
George
Edwards
,
Joe
Thompson
,
Bampfylde
More
Carew
,
Young
Scarron
,
and
Miss
Betsy
Thoughtless
;
and
if
you
have
a
taste
for
drawing
,
I
can
entertain
you
with
a
parcel
of
print
by
the
good
master
.
"
    
<EOS>
a
man
of
our
hero
's
politeness
,
could
not
help
express
himself
in
the
warm
term
of
gratitude
for
this
courteous
declaration
.
 
<EOS>
He
thank
the
captain
in
particular
for
his
oblige
offer
,
and
beg
he
would
be
so
good
as
to
present
his
respect
to
the
society
of
which
he
long
to
be
a
member
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
determine
therefore
,
that
Minikin
should
return
in
an
hour
,
when
the
count
would
be
dress
,
in
order
to
conduct
him
into
the
presence
of
his
majesty
;
and
he
have
already
take
his
leave
for
the
present
,
when
all
of
a
sudden
he
come
back
,
and
take
hold
of
a
waistcoat
that
lie
upon
a
chair
,
"
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
give
me
leave
to
look
at
that
fringe
;
I
think
it
be
the
most
elegant
knitting
I
ever
see
:
but
pray
,
Sir
,
be
not
these
quite
out
of
fashion
:
 
<EOS>
I
think
plain
silk
,
such
as
this
that
I
wear
,
have
be
the
mode
;
with
the
pocket
very
low
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
before
Fathom
have
time
to
make
any
sort
of
reply
,
he
take
notice
of
his
hat
and
pump
;
the
first
of
which
he
say
be
too
narrow
in
the
brim
,
and
the
last
an
inch
too
low
in
the
heel
;
indeed
they
form
a
remarkable
contrast
with
his
own
;
for
,
exclusive
of
the
fashion
of
the
cock
,
which
resemble
the
form
of
a
roman
galley
,
the
brim
of
his
hat
,
if
properly
spread
,
would
have
project
a
shade
sufficient
to
shelter
a
whole
file
of
musqueteer
from
the
heat
of
a
summer
's
sun
;
and
the
heel
of
his
shoe
be
so
high
as
to
raise
his
foot
three
inch
at
least
,
from
the
surface
of
the
earth
.
    
<EOS>
have
make
these
observation
for
the
credit
of
his
taste
,
he
retire
,
and
return
at
the
time
appoint
,
accompany
Ferdinand
to
the
apartment
of
the
King
,
at
the
door
of
which
,
their
ear
be
invade
with
a
strange
sound
,
be
that
of
an
human
voice
imitate
the
noise
of
a
drum
.
 
<EOS>
the
captain
hear
this
alarm
,
make
a
full
stop
,
and
give
the
count
to
understand
that
his
majesty
be
busy
,
beg
he
would
not
take
it
amiss
,
if
the
introduction
should
be
delay
for
a
few
moment
.
    
<EOS>
Fathom
curious
to
know
the
meaning
of
what
he
have
hear
,
apply
to
his
guide
for
information
,
and
learn
that
the
king
and
the
major
,
whom
he
have
nominate
to
the
post
of
his
general
in
chief
,
be
employ
in
land
troop
upon
the
genoese
territory
:
that
is
,
that
they
be
settle
before
-
hand
the
manner
of
their
disembarkation
.
    
<EOS>
He
then
,
by
the
direction
of
his
conductor
,
reconnoitre
them
through
the
key
hole
,
and
perceive
the
sovereign
and
his
minister
sit
on
opposite
side
of
a
deal
board
table
cover
with
a
large
chart
or
map
,
upon
wich
he
see
a
great
number
of
muscle
and
oister
shell
,
range
in
a
certain
order
,
and
at
a
little
distance
,
several
regular
square
and
column
make
of
card
cut
in
small
piece
.
 
<EOS>
the
prince
himself
,
whose
eye
be
reinforce
by
spectacle
,
survey
this
armament
with
great
attention
;
while
the
general
put
the
whole
in
action
,
and
conduct
their
motion
by
beat
of
drum
.
 
<EOS>
the
muscle
-
shell
,
accord
to
Minikin
's
explanation
,
represent
the
transport
,
the
oyster
-
shell
be
consider
as
the
man
of
war
that
cover
the
troop
in
landing
,
and
the
piece
of
card
exhibit
the
different
body
into
which
the
army
be
form
upon
its
disembarkation
.
    
<EOS>
as
an
affair
of
such
consequence
could
not
be
transact
without
opposition
,
they
have
provide
diver
ambuscade
,
consist
of
the
enemy
,
whom
they
represent
by
grey
pease
;
and
accordingly
,
general
Macleaver
perceive
the
say
grey
pease
marching
along
shore
,
to
attack
his
force
before
they
could
be
draw
up
in
battalia
,
thus
address
himself
to
the
oyster
-
shell
in
an
audible
voice
:
 
<EOS>
"
You
man
of
war
,
do
not
you
see
the
front
of
the
enemy
advance
,
and
the
rest
of
the
detachment
follow
out
of
sight
?
    
<EOS>
Arrah
!
<EOS>
the
Devil
burn
you
,
why
do
not
you
come
ashore
and
open
your
battery
?
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
push
the
shell
towards
the
breach
,
perform
the
cannonading
with
his
voice
,
the
grey
pease
be
soon
put
in
confusion
,
the
general
be
beat
,
the
card
march
forwards
in
order
of
battle
,
and
the
enemy
have
retreat
with
great
precipitation
,
they
take
possession
of
their
ground
without
farth
difficulty
.
     
<EOS>
He
contemplate
Majesty
and
its
satellite
in
eclipse
.
   
<EOS>
this
expedition
be
happily
finish
,
general
Macleaver
put
the
whole
army
,
navy
,
transports
and
scene
of
action
,
into
a
canvas
bag
,
the
prince
unsaddle
his
nose
,
and
captain
Minikin
be
admit
,
our
hero
be
introduce
in
form
.
 
<EOS>
very
gracious
be
the
reception
he
meet
with
from
his
majesty
,
who
with
a
most
princely
demeanour
,
welcome
him
to
court
,
and
even
seat
him
on
his
right
hand
,
in
token
of
particular
regard
.
 
<EOS>
true
it
be
,
this
presence
-
chamber
be
not
so
superb
,
nor
the
appearance
of
the
king
so
magnificent
,
as
to
render
such
an
honour
intoxicate
to
any
person
of
our
hero
's
coolness
and
discretion
:
in
lieu
of
tapestry
the
apartment
be
hang
with
half
-
penny
ballad
,
a
truckle
-
bed
without
curtain
supply
the
place
of
a
canopy
,
and
instead
of
a
crown
his
majesty
wear
a
woolen
night
-
cap
.
    
<EOS>
yet
,
in
spite
of
these
disadvantage
,
there
be
an
air
of
dignity
in
his
deportment
,
and
a
nice
physiognomist
would
have
perceive
something
majestic
in
the
feature
of
his
countenance
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
certainly
a
personage
of
a
very
prepossessing
mien
;
his
manner
be
engage
;
his
conversation
agreeable
;
and
any
man
whose
heart
be
subject
to
the
melting
of
humanity
,
would
have
deplore
his
distress
,
and
look
upon
him
as
a
most
pathetic
instance
of
that
miserable
reverse
,
to
which
all
human
grandeur
be
expose
.
 
<EOS>
His
fall
be
even
great
than
that
of
Belisarius
,
who
after
have
obtain
many
glorious
victory
over
the
enemy
of
his
country
,
be
say
to
have
be
reduce
to
such
extremity
of
indigence
,
that
in
his
old
age
,
when
he
be
deprive
of
his
eye
sight
,
he
sit
upon
the
high
way
like
a
common
mendicant
,
implore
the
charity
of
passenger
,
in
the
piteous
exclamation
of
Date
obolum
Belisario
;
that
is
,
"
spare
a
farthing
to
your
poor
old
soldier
Belisarius
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
this
general
's
disgrace
be
not
so
remarkable
as
that
of
Theodore
,
because
he
be
the
servant
of
Justinian
,
consequently
his
fortune
depend
upon
the
nod
of
that
emperor
;
whereas
the
other
actually
possess
the
throne
of
sovereignty
by
the
good
of
all
title
,
namely
,
the
unanimous
election
of
the
people
over
whom
he
reign
;
and
attract
the
eye
of
all
Europe
,
by
the
effort
he
make
in
break
the
band
of
oppression
,
and
vindicate
that
liberty
which
be
the
birthright
of
man
.
    
<EOS>
the
English
of
former
day
,
alike
renowned
for
generosity
and
valour
,
treat
those
hostile
prince
whose
fate
it
be
to
wear
their
chain
,
with
such
delicacy
of
benevolence
,
as
even
dispel
the
horror
of
captivity
;
but
,
their
posterity
of
this
refined
age
,
feel
no
compunction
at
see
an
unfortunate
monarch
,
their
former
friend
,
ally
,
and
partizan
,
languish
amidst
the
misery
of
a
loathsome
goal
,
for
a
paultry
debt
contract
in
their
own
service
.
 
<EOS>
but
moralize
apart
,
our
hero
have
not
long
converse
with
this
extraordinary
debtor
,
who
,
in
his
present
condition
,
assume
no
other
title
than
that
of
Baron
,
than
he
perceive
in
him
a
spirit
of
Quixotism
,
which
all
his
experience
,
together
with
the
vicissitude
of
his
fortune
,
have
not
be
able
to
overcome
;
not
that
his
idea
soar
to
such
a
pitch
of
extravagant
hope
as
that
which
take
possession
of
his
mess
-
mate
,
who
frequently
quarrel
one
with
another
,
about
the
degree
of
favour
to
which
they
should
be
intitle
after
the
king
's
restoration
;
but
he
firmly
believe
that
affair
would
speedily
take
such
a
turn
in
Italy
,
as
would
point
out
to
the
english
court
,
the
expediency
of
employ
him
again
;
and
this
persuasion
seem
to
support
him
against
every
species
of
poverty
and
mortification
.
    
<EOS>
while
they
be
busy
in
trim
the
balance
of
power
on
the
other
side
of
the
Alps
,
their
deliberation
be
interrupt
by
the
arrival
of
a
scullion
,
who
come
to
receive
their
order
touch
the
bill
of
fare
for
dinner
,
and
his
majesty
find
much
more
difficulty
in
settle
this
important
concern
,
than
in
compromise
all
the
difference
between
the
emperor
and
the
queen
of
Spain
.
    
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
General
Macleaver
undertake
the
office
of
purveyor
for
his
prince
;
captain
Minikin
insist
upon
treat
the
count
,
and
in
a
little
time
the
table
be
cover
with
a
cloth
,
which
,
for
the
sake
of
my
delicate
reader
,
I
shall
not
attempt
to
describe
.
    
<EOS>
at
this
period
,
they
be
join
by
Sir
Mungo
Barebones
,
who
have
find
mean
to
purchase
a
couple
of
mutton
chop
,
have
cook
a
mess
of
broth
,
which
he
now
bring
in
a
saucepan
to
the
general
rendezvous
:
this
be
the
most
remarkable
object
which
have
hitherto
present
itself
to
the
eye
of
Fathom
:
be
naturally
of
a
meagre
habit
,
he
be
by
indigence
and
hard
study
wear
almost
to
the
bone
,
and
so
bend
towards
the
earth
,
that
,
in
walking
,
his
body
describe
at
least
150
degree
of
a
circle
.
 
<EOS>
the
want
of
stocking
and
shoe
he
supply
with
a
jockey
straight
boot
and
an
half
jack
.
 
<EOS>
His
thigh
and
middle
be
case
in
a
monstrous
pair
of
brown
trunk
breech
,
which
the
keeper
buy
for
his
use
,
from
the
executor
of
a
dutch
seaman
who
have
lately
die
in
the
jail
:
his
shirt
retain
no
sign
of
its
original
colour
,
his
body
be
shroud
in
an
old
greasy
tattered
plaid
night
gown
;
a
blue
and
white
handkerchief
surround
his
head
,
and
his
look
betoken
that
immense
load
of
care
,
which
he
have
voluntarily
incur
for
the
eternal
salvation
of
sinner
.
 
<EOS>
yet
this
figure
,
uncouth
as
it
be
,
make
his
compliment
to
our
adventurer
in
term
of
the
most
elegant
address
,
and
in
the
course
of
conversation
,
disclose
a
great
fund
of
valuable
knowledge
.
    
<EOS>
He
have
appear
in
the
great
world
,
and
bear
diver
office
of
dignity
and
trust
,
with
universal
applause
:
his
courage
be
undoubted
,
his
moral
be
unimpeached
,
and
his
person
hold
in
great
veneration
and
esteem
;
when
his
evil
genius
engage
him
in
the
study
of
Hebrew
,
and
the
mystery
of
the
jewish
religion
,
which
fairly
disorder
his
brain
,
and
render
him
incapable
of
manage
his
temporal
affair
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
ought
to
have
be
employ
in
the
function
of
his
post
,
he
be
always
rapt
in
visionary
conference
with
Moses
on
the
Mount
;
rather
than
regulate
the
oeconomy
of
his
houshold
,
he
chuse
to
exert
his
endeavour
in
settle
the
precise
meaning
of
the
word
Elohim
;
and
have
discover
that
now
the
period
be
come
,
when
the
Jews
and
Gentiles
would
be
convert
,
he
postpone
every
other
consideration
,
in
order
to
facilitate
that
great
and
glorious
event
.
    
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
Ferdinand
have
see
every
member
of
the
club
,
except
the
french
chevalier
,
who
seem
to
be
quite
neglect
by
the
society
;
for
his
name
be
not
once
mention
during
this
communication
,
and
they
sit
down
to
dinner
,
without
ask
whether
he
be
dead
or
alive
.
 
<EOS>
the

Our

who
have
ask
pardon
for
the

who
,
without

have
be
base
enough
to
refuse
him
credit
for
a
few
necessary
,
until
he
could
have
a
remittance
from
his
steward
in
France
;
he
therefore
conjure
count
Fathom
,
as
a
stranger
and
nobleman
like
himself
,
to
be
the
messenger
of
defiance
,
which
he
resolve
to
send
to
that
brutal
goaler

that
for
the
future
he
may
learn
to
make
proper
distinction
in
the
exercise
of
his

<EOS>
Fathom
,
who
have
no
inclination
to
offend
this
choleric
Frenchman
,
assure
him
that
he
may
depend
upon
his
friendship
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
prevail
upon
him
to
accept
of
a
small
supply
,
in
consequence
of
which
,
he
procure
a
pound
of
sausage
,
and
join
the
rest
of
the

without

make
a
very
suitable
addition
to
such
an
assemblage
of
rarity

Tho

this

by
cardinal

<EOS>
Perceiving

that

like
the
prophet

he
have
no
honour
in

he
no

obtain
his

he
retire
to
England

where
he
be
prompt
by
his
philanthropy
,
to
propose
an
expedient
to
our
ministry
,
which
would
have
save
a
vast
effusion
of
blood
and
treasure
;
this
be
an
agreement
between
the
queen
of
Hungary
and
the
late
emperor
,
to
decide
their
pretension
by
a
single
combat
;
in
which
case
he
offer
himself
as
the
bavarian
champion
;
but
in
this
endeavour
he
also
prove
unsuccessful
:
then
turn
his
attention
to
the
delight
of
poetry
,
he
become
so
enamoured
of
the
muse
,
that
he
neglect
every
other
consideration

and
she
,
as
usual

gradually
conduct
him
to
the

never

a

<EOS>
one

<EOS>
among
other
topic
of
conversation
that
be
discuss
at
this
genial
meeting
,
Sir
Mungo
's
scheme
be
bring
upon
the
carpet
,
by
his
Majesty
,
who
be
graciously
pleased
to
ask
how
his
subscription
fill
?
    
<EOS>
to
this
interrogation
,
the
knight
answer
,
that
he
meet
with
great
opposition
from
a
spirit
of
levity
and
self
conceit
,
which
seem
to
prevail
in
this
generation
;
but
,
that
no
difficulty
should
discourage
him
,
from
persevere
in
his
duty
;
and
he
trust
in
God
,
that
in
a
very
little
time
he
should
be
able
to
confute
and
overthrow
the
false
philosophy
of
the
modern
,
and
to
restore
the
writing
of
Moses
to
that
pre
-
heminence
and
veneration
,
which
be
due
to
an
inspired
author
.
 
<EOS>
He
speak
of
the
immortal
Newton
with
infinite
contempt
,
and
undertake
to
extract
from
the
Pentateuch
,
a
system
of
chronology
,
which
would
ascertain
the
progress
of
rime
since
the
fourth
day
of
the
creation
to
the
present
hour
with
such
exactness
,
that
not
one
vibration
of
a
pendulum
should
be
lose
!
<EOS>
nay
,
be
affirm
that
the
perfection
of
all
art
and
science
may
be
attain
by
study
those
sacred
memoir
;
and
that
he
himself
do
not
dispair
of
learn
from
them
the
art
of
transmute
baser
metal
into
gold
.
    
<EOS>
the
chevalier
,
though
he
do
not
pretend
to
contradict
these
assertion
,
be
too
much
attach
to
his
own
religion
to
acquiesce
in
the
knight
's
project
of
convert
the
Jews
and
the
Gentiles
to
the
protestant
heresy
,
which
,
he
say
,
God
Almighty
would
never
suffer
to
triumph
over
the
interest
of
his
own
holy
catholic
church
.
 
<EOS>
this
objection
produce
abundance
of
altercation
between
two
very
unequal
disputant
,
and
the
Frenchman
find
himself
puzzelle
by
the
learning
of
his
antagonist
,
have
recourse
to
the
Argumentum
ad
hominem
,
by
lay
his
hand
upon
his
sword
,
and
declare
that
he
be
ready
to
lose
the
last
drop
of
his
blood
in
opposition
to
such
a
damnable
scheme

<EOS>
Sir
Mungo

though
in
all
appearance

reduce
to
the
last
stage
of
animal
existence
,
no
sooner
hear
this
epithet
apply
to
his
plan
,
than
his
eye
gleam
like
lightning
;
he
spring
from
his
seat
,
with
the
agility
of
a
grass

hopper
,
and
dart
himself
out
at
the

with

weapon
,
which

<EOS>
this

<EOS>
the
chevalier
,
unterrified
by
this
dreadful
salutation
,
desire
he
would
accompany
him
to
a
more
convenient
place
;
and
the
world

in

<EOS>
"
Sir

I

pardon
for
this
intrusion

I

you
about

by

methink
it
be
an

to
pluck
bright
honour
from
the

or
dive
into
the
bottom
of
the
deep

where
fathom

pluck
up

"
    
<EOS>
there
be
a
boldness
and
ease
in
the
expression

the
image

very
picturesque

<EOS>
but
,
without

<EOS>
You

the
question
Sir

when
I
tell
you
that
major
Macleaver

Mrs
Minikin
to
them
,
as
to
lady
of
character

and
I
do
not

I

a

perhaps
I

<EOS>
Sir

I
have
nothing
but
my
reputation
to
depend
upon
;
and
I
hope
you
will

Fathom

<EOS>
this
explanation

begin
to
glow
with
indignation

his

he
swell
to

<EOS>
Sir

you
seem

make
very

I
will
assure
you

I

demand

<EOS>
this

He
make
an
apology

to
which

he
say

he
be
reduce
by
the
heat

though
he
may
have
assign
a
more
adequate
cause

by

<EOS>
He
read
the

with
great
composure

like
a

then
address
himself
to

<EOS>
this

my

if
both

but

<EOS>
Fathom
approve
of
his
remark
,
which
he
reinforce
with
sundry
consideration
to
the

purpose

and
beg
the
assistance
of

advice

in

to
terminate
the

without
bloodshed

that
no

in

seem

<EOS>
"
with
all

say
the

I
have
a
great
regard

my

<EOS>
I

he
throw
aside
the

display
scar

innumerable

<EOS>
"
I
remember
,
proceed
this
champion
,
when
I
be
a
slave
at
Algiers
,
Murphy
Macmorris
<EOS>
and
I
happen
to
have
some
difference
in
the

upon
which
he
bad
me
turn
out

<EOS>
Arra
,
for
what
?
<EOS>
say
I
<EOS>
,
here
be
no

and
you
would
not

such
a

box
like
an

carman
.
 
<EOS>
after
he
have
puzzle
himself
for
some
time
,
he
propose
that
we
should
retire
into
a
corner
,
and
funk
at
one
another
with
brimstone
,
till
one
of
us
should
give
out

<EOS>
accordingly
we
cram
half
a
dozen
of
tobacco
pipe
with
sulphur
,
and
set
foot
to
foot
,
begin
to
smoke
,
and
keep
a
constant
fire
,
until
Macmorris
drop
down
;
then
I
throw
away
my
pipe
,
and
take
poor
Murphy
in
my
arm
,
"
what

so

own

I
have
obtain
the

we

<EOS>
now
if
Mr

think
proper
to
put
the
affair
upon

Fathom
could
not
help
laugh
at
the
proposal
,
to
which
,
however
,
he
object
on
account
of
Minikin
's
delicate
constitution
,
which
may
suffer
more
detriment
from
breathe
in
an
atmosphere
of
sulphur
,
than
from
the
discharge
of
a
pistol
,
or
the
thrust
of
a
small
sword
.
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
suggest
another
expedient
in
lieu
of
the
sulphur
,
namely
,
the
gum
call
Assa
foetida
,
which
though
abundantly
nauseous
,
could
have
no

this

be
calculate
for

him
to
the
ridicule
of
his

begin
to
storm
with
great
violence
;

by
the
assurance
and
address
of
Fathom
,
he
be
at
length
reconcile
to
the
plan

and
preparation
be

,
about

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
for
his

the
effluvia
of
this
drug

which
he
have
frequently
use
in
the
course
of
an
hypochondriac
disorder

whereas
Macleaver

who
be
a
stranger
to
all

by
his
wry
face
and
attempt
to
puke

express
the

he
continue

untill
the

such
an
intolerable

to

whose

so
disconcert
by
this
disagreeable
and
unforeseen
discharge

that
he
fall

into

he
be
come
to
upbraid
him
with
his
villainy

ingratitude
,
and
he
in
vain
endeavour
to
recollect
himself
from
that
terror
and
guilty
confusion
which
his
appearance
have
inspire
;
when
the
stranger
lift
up
his
eye
,
start
back
with
sign
of
extreme
amazement

after
a
considerable
pause

with

he
run
towards
our

and
while
he
clasp
him
in
his
arm
,
with
all
the
eagerness
of
affection

protest
that
this
be
one
of

Ferdinand

<EOS>
these

,
that
far
from
forget
the
obligation
he
owe
to

or

in
the
beginning
of

posterior

<EOS>
Young
Melville
,
whose
own
heart
have
never
know
the
instigation
of
fraud
,
implicitly
believe
the
story
and
protestation
of
Fathom
;

though
he
would
not
justify
that
part
of
his
conduct
by
which
the
term

indiscretion
into

by

precipitancy
of

the
allurement

artful

nay

with
the
utmost
warmth
of
friendship
,
he
undertake
to
wait
upon

and
endeavour
to
soften
him
into
some
reasonable
term
of

<EOS>
Fathom
seem
to
be
quite
overwhelmed
with
a
deep
sense
of
all
this
goodness
,
and
affect
the
most
eager
impatience
to
know
the
particular
of
Renaldo
's
fate
,
since
their
unhappy
separation
;
more
especially
his
errand
to
this
uncomfortable
place
,
which
he
should
henceforth
revere
as
the
providential
scene
of
their
reunion

nor
do
he
forget
to
enquire
,
in
the
most
affectionate
and
dutiful
manner
,
about
the
situation
of
his
noble
parent
and
amiable
sister

<EOS>
at
mention
of
these
name
,
Renaldo

fetch
a
deep
sigh
,
"
alas

<EOS>
my
friend
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
the
Count
be
no
more

and
what
aggravate
my
affliction
for
the
loss
of
such
a
father

it
be
my
misfortune
to
be
under
his
displeasure
at
the
time
of
his
death

<EOS>
have
I
be
present
on

melancholy
occasion

<EOS>
so
well
I
know
his
generosity
and
paternal
tenderness

that
sure
I

he
would
in
his
last
moment
have
forgive
an
only
son
whose
life
have
be
a
continual
effort
to
render
himself
worthy
of
such
a
parent
,
and
whose
crime
be
no
other
than
an
honourable
passion
for
the
most
meritorious
of
her
sex
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
remove
at
a
fatal
distance
from
him
,
and
doubtless
my
conduct
must
have
be
invidiously
misrepresent
.
    
<EOS>
be
that
as
it
will
,
my
mother
have
again
give
her
hand
in
wedlock
to
count
Trevasi

by
whom
I
have
the
mortification
to
be
inform
that
I
be
totally
exclude
from
my
father
's
succession
;
and
I
learn
from
other
quarter
,
that
my
sister
be
barbarously
treat
by
this
inhuman
father

in
law

<EOS>
Grant
,
Heaven
,
I
may
soon
have
an
opportunity
of
expostulate
with
the
tyrant
upon
that
subject

so
say
,
his
cheek
glow

his

resentment

he

that

this

of
consanguinity
which
she

the

<EOS>
indeed
,
the
picture
she
draw
be
so
move

her
expression
so
sensibly
pathetic

that
no

could
peruse
it
without

Renaldo

<EOS>
Fathom
,
in
the
consciousness
of
his
own
practice

immediately
comprehend
the
scheme
of
this

and
confidently
assure
him
,
that
no
such
person
reside
in
the

in
any

and
when
his

these
assurance
be
confirm
;
and
that
stern

tell
him
,
he
have
be
impose
upon

a
stale
trick
which

often

it
their
business
to
pick
up
hint
of

relate
to
private
family
,
upon
which
they
build
such
superstructure
of
fraud
and
imposition
.
    
<EOS>
however
pique
<EOS>
the
young
Hungarian
may
be
to
find
himself
dupe
in
this
manner
,
he
rejoyce
at
the
occasion
which
have
throw
Fathom
in
his
way
;
and
,
after
have
make
him
a
tender
of
his
purse
,
take
his
leave
,
on
purpose
to
wait
upon
Trapwell
,
who
be
not
quite
so
untractable
as
an
enraged
cuckold
commonly

for
,
by
this
time
,
he
have
accomplish
the
good
part
of
his
aim
,
which
be
to
be
devorce
from
his
wife
,
and
be
fully
convince
that
the
defendant
be
no
more
than
a
needy
adventurer
,
who
in
all
probability
would
be
release
by
an
act
of
parliament
for
the
benefit
of
insolvent
debtor
;
in
which
case
,
he
(
the
plaintiff

would
reap
no
solid
advantage
from
his
imprisonment
.
    
<EOS>
He
therefore
listen
to
the
remonstrance
of
the
mediator
,
and
after
much
canvassing
agree
to
discharge
the
defendant
in
consideration
of
two
hundred
pound
,
which
be
immediately
pay
by
Count
Melvil
,
who
by
this
deduction
be
reduce
to
somewhat
less

thirty

<EOS>
nevertheless
he
chearfully
beggar
himself
in
behalf
of
his

for

release
<EOS>
he
forthwith
obtain
an
order
;
and
next
day
our

have
bid
a
formal
adieu
to
his

in
distress
,
and
in
particular
to
his

for
whose
restoration
his
prayer
be
prefer
,
he
quit
the
jail

accompany
his

,
with
all
the
outward
mark
of
unutterable

Surley

if
his

it
would
have

touuche
by
the
circumstance
of
this
redemption

but
,
have
not
his

be
invincible
to
all
such
attack

these
memoire

possibly

never

<EOS>
when
they

that
young

He

very
advantageous

inflame
with
the
desire
of
see
the
world
before
he
could
take
any
step
towards
a
settlement
for

:
that
he
have
signify
his
sentiment
on
this
head
to
the
Count
,
who
oppose
them
with
unusual
obstinacy
,
as
productive
of
a
delay
which
may
be
fatal
to
his
proposal
:
for
which
reason
he
have
retire
incognito
from
his
family

and
travel
through
sundry
state
and
country
in
a
disguise
,
by
which
he
elude
the
inquiry
of

the
irresistible
charm
of

;
after
the
torment
of
which
,
he
have
happily
find
her
in
England
,
where
she
now
live
entirely
cut
off
from
her
native
country
and
connection
,
and
destitute
of
every
other
resource
,
but
his
honour
,
love
,
and
protection
:
<EOS>
and
,
finally
,
that
he
be
determined
to
combat
his
own
desire
,
how
violent
soever
they
may
be
,
until
he
should
have
make
some
suitable
provision
for
the
consequence
of
a
strict
union
with
the
mistress
of
his
soul
,
that
he
may
not
,
by
a
precipitate
marriage
,
ruin
the
person
whom
he
adore
.
    
<EOS>
this
end
he
propose
to
attain
,
by
an
application
to
the
court
of
Vienna
,
which
,
he
do
not
doubt
,
would
have
some
regard
to
his
own
service
and
that
of
his
father
;
and
thither
he
resolve
to
repair
with
the
first
opportunity
,
now
that
he
have
find
a
friend
with
whom
he
could
intrust
the
inestimable
jewel
of
his
heart
.
    
<EOS>
He
likewise
give
our
hero
to
understand
,
that
he
have
be
eight
month
in
England
,
during
which
he
have
live
in
a
frugal
manner
,
that
he
may
not
unnecessarily
exhaust
the
money
he
have
be
able
to
raise
upon
his
own
credit
;
that
hitherto
he
have
be
oblige
to
defer
his
departure
for
Germany
,
on
account
of
his
attendance
upon
the
mother
of
his
mistress
,
who
be
lately
dead
of
sorrow
and
chagrin
;
and
that
since
he
reside
in
London
,
he
have
often
hear
of
the
celebrated
Count
Fathom
,
though
he
never
imagine
that
his
friend
Ferdinand
could
be
distinguish
by
that
appellation
.
     
<EOS>
Fathom
justify
the
proverb
,
"
what
be
breed
in
the
bone
will
never
come
out
of
the
flesh
.
"
   
<EOS>
some
circumstance
of
this
conversation
make
a
deep
impression
upon
the
mind
of
our
adventurer
,
who
nevertheless
conceal
his
emotion
from
the
knowledge
of
his
friend
,
and
be
next
day
introduce
to
that
hide
treasure
of
which
Renaldo
have
speak
with
such
rapture
and
adoration
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
without
reason
he
have
expatiate
upon
the
personal
attraction
of
this
young
lady
,
whom
(
for
the
present
)
we
shall
call
Monimia
,
a
name
that
imply
her
orphan
situation
.
    
<EOS>
when
she
enter
the
room
,
even
Fathom
,
whose
eye
have
be
sate
with
beauty
,
be
struct
dumb
with
admiration
,
and
could
scarce
recollect
himself
so
far
as
to
perform
the
ceremony
of
his
introduction
.
    
<EOS>
She
seem
to
be
about
the
age
of
eighteen
:
<EOS>
her
stature
be
tall
;
her
motion
graceful
;
a
knot
of
artificial
flower
restrain
the
luxuriancy
of
her
fine
black
hair
that
flow
in
shine
ringlet
a
down
her
snowy
neck
.
 
<EOS>
the
contour
of
her
face
be
oval
;
her
forehead
remarkably
high
;
her
complexion
clean
and
delicate
,
though
not
florid
;
and
her
eye
be
so
pierce
as
to
strike
the
soul
of
every
beholder
:
yet
,
upon
this
occasion
,
one
half
of
their
vivacity
be
eclipse
by
a
languish
air
of
melancholy
concern
;
which
,
while
it
in
a
manner
sheathe
the
edge
of
her
beauty
,
add
a
most
engaging
sweetness
to
her
look
;
in
short
,
every
feature
be
elegantly
perfect
;
and
the
harmony
of
the
whole
ravishing
and
delightful
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
perceive
the
mutual
sentiment
of
the
two
lover
,
at
meeting
,
by
the
pleasure
that
sensibly
diffuse
itself
in
the
countenance
of
both
.
 
<EOS>
Fathom
be
receive
by
her
as
the
intimate
friend
of
her
admirer
,
whom
she
have
often
hear
of
in
term
of
the
most
sincere
affection
;
and
the
conversation
be
carry
on
in
the
italian
language
,
because
she
be
a
foreigner
who
have
not
as
yet
make
great
proficiency
in
the
knowledge
of
the
english
tongue
.
    
<EOS>
Her
understanding
be
such
,
as
,
instead
of
diminish
,
reinforce
the
prepossession
which
be
inspire
by
her
appearance
;
and
if
the
sum
total
of
her
charm
could
not
melt
the
heart
,
it
at
least
excited
the
appetite
of
Fathom
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
gaze
upon
her
with
such
violence
of
desire
,
as
have
never
transport
him
before
;
and
instantly
begin
to
harbour
thought
,
not
only
destructive
to
the
peace
of
his
generous
patron
,
but
also
to
the
prudential
maxim
he
have
adopt
on
his
first
entrance
into
life
.
    
<EOS>
We
have
already
record
diver
instance
of
his
conduct
,
to
prove
that
there
be
an
intemperance
in
his
blood
,
which
often
interfere
with
his
caution
:
and
although
he
have
sound
mean
to
render
this
heat
sometimes
subservient
to
his
interest
;
yet
,
in
all
probability
,
Heaven
mingle
the
ingredient
in
his
constitution
,
on
purpose
to
counteract
his
consummate
craft
,
defeat
the
villainy
of
his
intention
,
and
,
at
last
,
expose
him
to
the
justice
of
the
law
,
and
the
contempt
of
his
fellow
creature
.
    
<EOS>
stimulate
as
he
be
by
the
beauty
of
the
incomparable
Monimia
,
he
foresee
that
the
conquest
of
her
heart
would
cost
him
a
thousand
time
more
labour
and
address
than
all
the
victory
he
have
ever
atchieve
:
for
besides
her
superior
understanding
,
her
sentiment
of
honour
,
virtue
,
gratitude
,
religion
,
and
pride
of
birth
,
her
heart
be
already
engage
by
the
tender
tie
of
love
and
obligation
,
to
a
man
whose
person
and
acquire
accomplishment
at
least
equal
his
own
;
and
whose
connexion
with
him
be
of
such
a
nature
,
as
raise
an
almost
insurmountable
bar
to
his
design
:
because
,
with
what
face
could
he
commence
rival
to
the
person
whose
family
have
raise
him
from
want
and
servility
,
and
whose
own
generosity
have
rescue
him
from
the
misery
of
a
dreary
jail
?
    
<EOS>
notwithstanding
these
reflection
,
he
would
not
lay
aside
an
idea
which
so
agreeably
flatter
his
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
like
every
other
projector
in
the
same
circumstance
,
be
so
partial
to
his
own
qualification
,
as
to
think
the
lady
would
soon
perceive
a
difference
between
him
and
Renaldo
that
could
not
fail
to
turn
to
his
advantage
in
her
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
He
depend
a
good
deal
on
the
levity
and
inconstancy
of
the
sex
;
and
do
not
doubt
,
that
,
in
the
course
of
their
acquaintance
,
he
should
profit
by
that
languor
which
often
creep
upon
and
flatten
the
intercourse
of
lover
cloy
with
the
sight
and
conversation
of
each
other
.
    
<EOS>
this
way
of
arguing
be
very
natural
to
a
man
,
who
have
never
know
other
motive
than
those
of
sensuality
and
convenience
;
and
perhaps
,
upon
these
maxim
,
he
may
have
succeed
with
nine
tenth
of
the
fair
sex
:
but
,
for
once
,
he
err
in
his
calculation
.
 
<EOS>
Monimia
's
soul
be
perfect
:
her
virtue
impregnable
.
 
<EOS>
His
first
approach
be
,
as
usual
,
perform
by
the
method
of
insinuation
,
which
succeed
so
well
,
that
in
a
few
day
,
he
actually
acquire
a
very
distinguished
share
of
her
favour
and
esteem
:
to
this
he
have
be
recommend
in
the
warm
strain
of
exaggerate
friendship
,
by
her
dear
Renaldo
;
so
that
place
the
most
unreserved
confidence
in
his
honour
and
integrity
,
and
be
almost
quite
destitute
of
acquaintance
,
she
make
no
scruple
of
own
herself
pleased
with
his
company
and
conversation
;
and
therefore
he
be
never
abridg'd
in
point
of
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
too
much
discernment
to
overlook
his
uncommon
talent
and
agreeable
address
,
and
too
much
susceptibility
to
observe
them
with
indifference
.
    
<EOS>
She
not
only
regard
him
as
the
confident
of
her
lover
,
but
admire
him
as
a
person
whose
attachment
do
honour
to
Count
Melvil
's
choice
:
she
find
his
discourse
remarkably
entertaining
,
his
politeness
dignify
with
an
air
of
uncommon
sincerity
;
and
she
be
ravish
with
his
skill
in
musick
,
an
art
of
which
she
be
deeply
enamour
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
thus
ingratiate
himself
with
the
fair
Monimia
,
Renaldo
rejoice
at
their
intimacy
,
be
extremely
happy
in
the
thought
of
have
find
a
friend
who
could
amuse
and
protect
the
dear
creature
in
his
absence
.
 
<EOS>
that
she
may
be
the
better
prepare
for
the
temporary
separation
which
he
meditate
,
he
begin
to
be
less
frequent
in
his
visit
,
or
rather
to
interrupt
,
by
gradual
intermission
,
the
constant
attendance
he
have
bestow
upon
her
since
her
mother
's
death
.
 
<EOS>
this
alteration
she
be
enable
to
bear
by
the
assiduity
of
Fathom
,
when
she
understand
that
her
lover
be
indispensibly
employ
in
negotiate
a
sum
of
money
for
the
purpose
of
his
intended
voyage
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
really
the
case
:
for
,
as
the
reader
hath
be
already
inform
,
the
provision
he
have
make
for
that
emergency
be
expede
in
behalf
of
our
adventurer
;
and
the
person
of
whom
he
have
borrow
it
,
far
from
approve
of
the
use
to
which
it
be
put
,
and
accommodate
him
with
a
fresh
supply
,
reproach
him
with
his
benevolence
as
an
act
of
dishonesty
to
them
,
and
,
instead
of
favour
this
second
application
,
threaten
to
distress
him
for
what
he
have
already
receive
.
    
<EOS>
while
he
endeavour
to
surmount
these
difficulty
,
his
small
reversion
be
quite
exhausted
,
and
he
see
himself
on
the
brink
of
want
the
common
necessary
of
life
.
    
<EOS>
there
be
no
difficulty
which
he
could
not
have
encounter
with
fortitude
,
<EOS>
have
he
alone
be
concern
:
but
his
affection
and
regard
for
Monimia
be
of
such
a
delicate
nature
,
that
,
far
from
be
able
to
bear
the
prospect
of
her
want
the
least
convenience
,
he
could
not
endure
that
she
should
suspect
her
situation
cost
him
a
moment
's
perplexity
;
because
he
foresee
it
would
wring
her
gentle
heart
with
unspeakable
anguish
and
vexation
.
 
<EOS>
this
therefore
he
endeavour
to
anticipate
by
expression
of
confidence
in
the
emperor
's
equity
,
and
frequent
declaration
touch
the
goodness
and
security
of
that
credit
from
which
he
derive
his
present
subsistence
.
     
<EOS>
Anecdotes
of
poverty
,
and
experiment
for
the
benefit
of
those
whom
it
may
concern
   
<EOS>
His
affair
be
thus
circumstance
,
it
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
he
pass
his
time
in
tranquillity
.
 
<EOS>
every
day
usher
in
new
demand
and
fresh
anxiety
:
for
,
though
his
oeconomy
be
frugal
,
it
could
not
be
support
without
money
;
and
now
not
only
his
fund
be
drain
,
but
also
his
private
friend
tired
of
relieve
his
domestic
necessity
<EOS>
:
nay
,
they
begin
to
relinquish
his
company
,
which
formerly
they
have
covet
;
and
those
who
still
favour
him
with
their
company
,
embitter
that
favour
with
disagreeable
advice
mingle
with
impertinent
reproof
.
    
<EOS>
They
loudly
exclaim
against
the
last
instance
of
his
friendship
for
Fathom
as
a
piece
of
wrong
head
extravagance
,
which
neither
his
fortune
could
afford
,
nor
his
conscience
excuse
;
and
alledge
that
such
specimen
of
generosity
be
vicious
in
any
man
,
let
his
finance
be
never
so
opulent
,
if
he
have
any
relation
of
his
own
who
need
his
assistance
;
but
altogether
scandalous
,
not
to
say
unjust
,
in
a
person
who
depend
for
his
his
own
support
upon
the
favour
of
his
friend
.
    
<EOS>
these
expostulation
do
not
even
respect
the
beauteous
,
the
accomplish
,
the
gentle
hearte
,
the
orphan
Monimia
.
 
<EOS>
although
they
own
her
perfection
,
and
do
not
deny
that
it
would
be
highly
meritorious
in
any
man
of
fortune
to
make
her
happy
,
they
disapprove
of
Renaldo
's
attachment
to
the
fair
beggar
,
make
light
of
that
intimate
union
of
heart
which
subsist
between
the
two
lover
,
and
which
no
humain
consideration
could
dissolve
;
and
some
among
them
,
in
the
consummation
of
their
prudence
,
venture
to
hint
a
proposal
of
provide
for
her
in
the
service
of
some
lady
of
fashion
.
    
<EOS>
any
reader
of
sensibility
will
easily
conceive
how
these
admonition
be
relish
by
a
young
gentleman
,
whose
pride
be
indomitable
,
whose
notion
of
honour
be
scrupulously
rigid
and
romantic
,
whose
temper
be
warm
,
and
whose
love
be
intense
.
 
<EOS>
every
such
suggestion
be
a
dagger
to
his
soul
;
and
what
render
the
torture
more
exquisite
,
he
lie
under
obligation
to
those
very
person
,
whose
selfish
and
sordid
sentiment
he
disdain
;
so
that
he
be
restrict
by
gratitude
from
give
vent
to
his
indignation
and
his
forlorn
circumstance
would
not
permit
him
to
renounce
their
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
while
he
struggle
with
these
mortification
his
want
grow
more
and
more
importunate
,
and
his
creditor
become
clamorous
.
    
<EOS>
Fathom
,
to
whom
all
his
grievance
be
disclose
,
lament
his
hard
hap
with
all
the
demonstration
of
sympathy
which
he
could
expect
to
find
in
such
a
zealous
adherent
;
he
upbraid
himself
incessantly
as
the
cause
of
his
patron
's
distress
;
take
God
to
witness
,
that
he
would
rather
have
perish
in
jail
,
than
have
enjoy
his
liberty
,
have
he
know
it
would
have
cost
his
dear
friend
and
benefactor
one
tenth
part
of
the
anguish
he
now
see
him
suffer
;
and
in
conclusion
,
the
fervency
of
his
affection
glow
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
offer
to
beg
,
steal
,
or
plunder
on
the
high
way
,
for
Renaldo
's
assistance
.
    
<EOS>
Certain
<EOS>
it
be
,
he
may
have
recollect
a
less
disagreeable
expedient
than
any
of
these
,
to
alleviate
the
pang
of
this
unhappy
lover
;
for
at
that
very
period
,
he
be
possess
of
money
and
moveable
to
the
amount
of
a
much
great
sum
than
that
which
be
necessary
to
remove
the
severe
pang
of
the
Count
's
misfortune
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
whether
he
do
not
reflect
upon
this
resource
,
or
be
willing
to
let
Melvil
be
better
acquaint
with
adversity
,
which
be
the
great
school
of
life
,
I
shall
leave
the
reader
to
detemine
:
<EOS>
yet
,
so
far
be
he
from
supply
the
want
of
the
young
Hungarian
,
that
he
do
not
scruple
to
receive
a
share
of
the
miserable
pittence
which
that
gentleman
make
shift
to
extort
from
the
complaisance
of
a
few
companion
,
whose
countenance
he
still
enjoy
.
    
<EOS>
Renaldo
's
life
be
now
become
a
sacrifice
to
the
most
poignant
distress
:
almost
his
whole
time
be
ingrosse
by
a
double
scheme
comprehend
his
effort
to
render
his
departure
practicable
,
and
his
expedient
for
rase
the
mean
of
daily
bread
.
 
<EOS>
with
regard
to
the
first
he
exert
himself
among
a
set
of
merchant
,
some
of
whom
know
his
family
and
expectation
?
<EOS>
and
,
for
the
last
,
he
be
fain
to
depend
upon
the
assistance
of
a
few
intimate
,
who
be
not
in
condition
to
furnish
him
with
sum
of
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
these
,
however
,
gradually
drop
off
,
on
pretence
of
friendly
resentment
for
his
indiscreet
conduct
;
so
that
he
find
himself
naked
and
desert
by
all
his
former
companion
,
except
one
gentleman
,
with
whom
he
have
live
in
the
most
unreserved
correspondence
,
as
with
a
person
of
the
warm
friendship
,
and
the
most
unbounded
benevolence
;
<EOS>
nay
,
he
have
actually
experience
repeat
proof
of
his
generosity
;
and
such
be
the
count
's
sentiment
of
the
gratitude
,
love
and
esteem
which
be
due
to
the
author
of
these
obligation
,
that
he
would
have
willingly
lay
down
his
own
life
for
his
interest
or
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
already
be
at
different
time
accommodate
by
this
benefactor
,
with
occasional
supply
,
amount
in
the
whole
to
about
forty
or
fifty
pound
;
and
so
fearfull
be
he
of
take
any
step
by
which
he
may
forefeit
the
good
-
will
of
this
gentleman
,
that
he
struggle
with
unparallelled
difficulty
and
vexation
,
before
he
could
prevail
upon
himself
to
put
his
liberality
to
another
proof
.
    
<EOS>
what
maxim
of
delicacy
will
not
the
dire
call
of
necessity
infringe
!
    
<EOS>
Reduced
to
the
alternative
of
apply
once
more
to
that
beneficence
which
have
never
fail
him
,
or
of
see
Monimia
starve
,
he
choose
the
first
,
as
of
two
evil
the
least
,
and
intrust
Fathom
with
a
letter
explain
the
bitterness
of
his
case
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
without
trepidation
that
he
receive
in
the
evening
,
from
his
messenger
,
an
answer
to
this
billet
:
<EOS>
but
what
be
his
pang
when
he
learn
the
content
?
 
<EOS>
the
gentleman
,
after
have
profess
himself
Melvil
's
sincere
well
-
wisher
,
give
him
to
understand
,
that
he
be
resolve
for
the
future
to
detach
himself
from
every
correspondence
which
would
be
inconvenient
for
him
to
maintain
;
that
he
consider
his
intimacy
with
the
Count
in
that
light
:
yet
nevertheless
,
if
his
distress
be
really
as
great
as
he
have
describe
it
,
he
would
still
contribute
something
towards
his
relief
;
and
accordingly
have
send
by
the
bearer
five
guinea
for
that
purpose
:
but
desire
him
to
take
notice
,
that
,
in
so
do
,
he
lay
himself
under
some
difficulty
.
    
<EOS>
Renaldo
's
grief
and
mortification
at
this
disappointment
be
unspeakable
:
he
now
see
demolish
the
last
screen
<EOS>
betwixt
him
and
the
extremity
of
indigence
and
woe
<EOS>
;
he
behold
the
mistress
of
his
soul
abandon
to
the
bleak
scene
of
poverty
and
want
;
and
he
deeply
resent
the
lofty
strain
of
the
letter
,
by
which
he
conceive
himself
treat
as
a
worthless
spendthrift
,
and
importunate
beggar
.
    
<EOS>
though
his
purse
be
exhaust
to
the
last
shilling
;
though
he
be
surround
with
necessity
and
demand
,
and
know
not
how
to
provide
another
meal
for
his
fair
dependent
,
he
,
in
opposition
to
all
the
suggestion
and
eloquence
of
Fathom
,
dispatch
him
with
the
money
and
another
billet
,
intimate
in
the
most
respectful
term
,
that
he
approve
of
his
friend
's
new
adopt
maxim
,
which
,
for
the
future
,
he
should
always
take
care
to
remember
;
and
that
he
have
send
back
the
last
instance
of
his
bounty
,
as
a
proof
how
little
he
be
dispose
to
incommode
his
benefactor
.
    
<EOS>
this
letter
,
though
sincerely
mean
,
and
write
in
a
very
serious
mood
,
the
gentleman
consider
as
an
ungrateful
piece
of
irony
,
and
in
that
opinion
complain
to
several
person
of
the
Count
's
acquaintance
,
who
unanimously
exclaim
against
him
,
as
a
sordid
,
unthankful
,
and
profligate
knave
,
that
abuse
and
revile
those
very
people
who
have
generously
befriend
him
,
whenever
they
find
it
inconvenient
to
nourish
his
extravagance
with
further
supply
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
these
accumulate
oppression
,
he
still
persevere
with
fortitude
in
his
endeavour
to
disentangle
himself
from
this
maze
of
misery
.
 
<EOS>
to
these
he
be
encourage
by
a
letter
which
about
this
time
he
receive
from
his
sister
,
import
,
that
she
have
good
reason
to
believe
the
real
will
of
her
father
have
be
suppress
for
certain
sinister
view
;
and
desire
him
to
hasten
his
departure
for
Hungary
,
where
he
would
still
find
some
friend
who
be
both
able
and
willing
to
support
his
cause
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
some
trinket
leave
;
the
pawn
-
broker
's
shop
be
still
open
;
and
hitherto
he
have
make
shift
to
conceal
from
Monimia
the
extent
of
his
affliction
.
    
<EOS>
the
money
-
broker
whom
he
employ
,
after
have
amuse
him
with
a
variety
of
scheme
,
which
serve
no
other
purpose
than
that
of
protract
his
own
job
,
at
length
undertake
to
make
him
acquaint
with
a
set
of
monie
man
who
have
be
very
adventurous
in
lend
sum
upon
personal
security
;
he
be
therefore
introduce
to
their
club
,
in
the
most
favourable
manner
,
after
the
broker
have
endeavour
to
prepossess
them
separately
,
with
magnificent
idea
of
his
family
and
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
by
mean
of
this
anticipation
,
he
be
receive
with
a
manifest
relaxation
of
that
severity
,
which
people
of
this
class
mingle
in
their
aspect
to
the
world
in
general
;
and
they
even
vie
with
each
other
in
their
demonstration
of
hospitality
and
respect
;
for
every
one
in
particular
look
upon
him
as
a
young
heir
,
who
would
bleed
freely
,
and
mortgage
at
cent
per
cent
.
    
<EOS>
Renaldo
,
buoy
up
with
these
exterior
civility
,
begin
to
flatter
himself
with
hope
of
success
,
which
,
however
,
be
soon
check
by
the
nature
of
the
conversation
;
during
which
the
chair
-
man
upbraid
one
of
the
member
in
open
club
,
for
have
once
lend
forty
pound
upon
slight
security
:
the
person
accuse
alledged
in
his
own
defence
,
that
the
borrower
be
his
own
kindsman
,
whose
fund
he
know
to
be
sufficient
;
that
he
have
grant
his
bond
,
and
be
at
the
expence
of
insure
his
life
for
the
money
;
and
,
in
conclusion
,
have
discharge
it
to
the
day
with
great
punctuality
.
 
<EOS>
these
allegation
be
not
deem
exculpatory
by
the
rest
of
the
assembly
,
who
with
one
voice
pronounce
him
guilty
of
unwarrantable
rashness
and
indiscretion
,
which
,
in
time
come
,
must
undoubtedly
operate
to
the
prejudice
of
his
character
and
credit
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
a
bitter
declaration
to
the
young
Count
,
who
,
nevertheless
,
endeavour
to
improve
the
footing
he
have
gain
among
them
,
by
court
their
company
,
conform
to
their
manner
,
and
attentively
listen
to
their
discourse
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
cultivate
them
with
great
assiduity
,
for
the
space
of
some
week
,
dine
at
their
house
upon
press
invitation
,
and
receive
repeat
offer
of
service
and
friendship
,
believe
that
thing
be
now
ripe
for
the
purpose
,
he
one
day
,
at
a
tavern
to
which
he
have
invite
him
to
dinner
,
venture
to
disclose
his
situation
to
him
,
whose
countenance
be
the
least
unpromising
;
and
as
he
introduce
the
business
with
a
proposal
of
borrow
money
,
he
perceive
his
eye
sparkle
with
a
visible
alacrity
,
from
which
he
draw
an
happy
presage
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
this
be
no
more
than
a
transient
gleam
of
sunshine
,
which
be
suddenly
obumbrate
by
the
sequel
of
his
explanation
;
insomuch
,
that
,
when
the
merchant
understand
the
nature
of
the
security
,
his
visage
be
involve
in
a
most
disagreeable
gloom
,
and
his
eye
distort
into
a
most
hideous
obliquity
of
vision
:
indeed
,
he
squint
so
horribly
,
that
Renaldo
be
amazed
and
almost
affrighted
at
his
look
,
until
he
perceive
that
this
distortion
proceed
from
concern
for
a
silver
tobacco
-
box
which
he
have
lay
down
by
him
on
the
table
,
after
have
fill
his
pipe
:
<EOS>
as
the
youth
proceed
to
unfold
his
necessity
,
the
other
become
gradually
alarm
for
this
utensil
,
to
which
he
dart
his
eye
askance
in
this
praeternatural
direction
,
until
he
have
slyly
secure
it
in
his
pocket
.
    
<EOS>
have
make
this
successful
conveyance
,
he
shift
his
eye
alternately
from
the
young
gentleman
to
the
broker
,
for
a
considerable
pause
,
during
which
he
in
silence
reproach
the
last
for
introduce
such
a
beggarly
varlet
to
his
acquaintance
;
then
take
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
,
"
Sir
,
(
say
he
,
address
himself
to
the
Count
)
if
I
have
all
the
inclination
in
the
world
to
comply
with
your
proposal
<EOS>
,
it
be
really
not
in
my
power
:
my
correspondent
abroad
have
remit
such
a
number
of
bad
bill
of
late
,
that
all
my
running
cash
hath
be
exhaust
in
support
their
credit
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Ferret
,
sure
I
be
,
you
be
not
ignorant
of
my
situation
;
and
I
be
not
a
little
surprized
,
that
you
should
bring
the
gentleman
to
me
,
on
business
of
this
kind
:
<EOS>
but
,
as
the
Wise
Man
observe
,
bray
a
fool
in
a
mortar
,
and
he
will
never
be
wise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
with
a
most
emphatic
glance
direct
to
the
broker
,
he
ring
the
bell
,
and
call
for
the
reckoning
;
when
,
find
that
he
be
to
be
the
guest
of
Renaldo
,
he
thank
him
drily
for
his
good
chear
,
and
in
an
abrupt
manner
take
himself
away
.
    
<EOS>
Though
baffle
in
this
quarter
,
the
young
gentleman
would
not
despair
;
but
forthwith
employ
Mr
Ferret
in
an
application
to
another
of
the
society
;
who
,
after
have
hear
the
term
of
his
commission
,
desire
him
to
tell
his
principal
,
that
he
could
do
nothing
,
without
the
concurrence
of
his
partner
,
who
happen
to
be
at
that
time
in
one
of
our
american
plantation
:
a
third
be
sollicite
,
excuse
himself
on
account
of
an
oath
which
he
have
lately
take
,
on
the
back
of
a
considerable
loss
:
a
fourth
be
try
,
make
answer
,
that
it
be
not
in
his
way
:
and
a
fifth
candidly
own
,
that
he
never
lend
money
without
proper
security
.
    
<EOS>
thus
the
forlorn
Renaldo
try
every
experiment
without
success
,
and
now
see
the
last
ray
of
hope
extinguish
.
 
<EOS>
well
nigh
destitute
of
present
support
,
and
encompass
with
unrelenting
dun
,
he
be
oblige
to
keep
within
door
,
and
seek
some
comfort
in
the
conversation
of
his
charming
mistress
,
and
his
faithful
friend
:
yet
,
even
there
,
he
experience
the
extremest
rigour
of
adverse
fate
.
 
<EOS>
every
rap
at
the
door
alarm
him
with
the
expectation
of
some
noisy
tradesman
demand
payment
:
 
when
he
endeavour
to
amuse
himself
with
drawing
,
some
unlucky
feature
of
the
occasional
portrait
recall
the
image
of
an
obdurate
creditor
,
and
make
him
tremble
at
the
work
of
his
own
hand
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
flee
for
shelter
to
the
flattering
creation
of
fancy
,
some
abhorred
idea
always
start
up
amidst
the
gay
vision
,
and
dissolve
the
pleasing
enchantment
.
 
<EOS>
even
the
seraphic
voice
of
Monimia
have
no
long
power
to
compose
the
anxious
tumult
of
his
mind
:
every
song
she
warble
,
every
tune
she
play
,
recall
to
his
remembrance
some
scene
of
love
and
happiness
elapse
;
and
overwhelm
his
soul
with
the
woful
comparison
of
past
and
present
fate
.
    
<EOS>
He
see
all
that
be
amiable
and
perfect
in
woman
,
all
that
he
hold
most
dear
and
sacred
upon
earth
,
totter
on
the
brink
of
misery
,
without
know
the
danger
of
her
situation
,
and
find
himself
unable
to
prevent
her
fall
,
or
even
to
forewarn
her
of
the
peril
;
for
,
as
we
have
already
observe
,
his
soul
could
not
brook
the
thought
of
communicate
the
tiding
of
distress
to
the
tender
-
hearted
Monimia
.
     
<EOS>
Renaldo
's
distress
deepen
,
and
Fathom
's
plot
thickens
.
   
<EOS>
such
aggravate
misfortune
could
not
fail
to
affect
his
temper
and
deportment
:
the
continual
effort
he
make
to
conceal
his
vexation
produce
a
manifest
distraction
in
his
behaviour
and
discourse
.
 
<EOS>
He
begin
to
be
seize
with
horror
at
the
sight
of
poor
Monimia
,
whom
he
therefore
shun
as
much
as
the
circumstance
of
their
correspondence
would
allow
;
and
every
evening
he
go
forth
alone
to
some
solitary
place
,
where
he
could
unperceived
give
a
loose
to
the
transport
of
his
sorrow
,
and
in
silence
meditate
some
mean
to
lighten
the
burden
of
his
woe
.
 
<EOS>
His
heart
be
sometimes
so
savage
with
despair
,
which
represent
mankind
as
his
inveterate
enemy
,
that
he
entertain
thought
of
denounce
war
against
the
whole
community
,
and
supply
his
own
want
with
the
spoil
he
should
win
:
at
other
time
,
he
be
tempt
with
the
desire
of
put
an
end
to
his
misery
and
life
together
:
yet
these
be
but
the
transitory
suggestion
of
temporary
madness
,
that
soon
yield
to
the
dictate
of
reason
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
execution
of
the
first
,
he
be
restrain
by
his
own
notion
of
honour
and
morality
;
and
from
use
the
other
expedient
,
he
be
deter
by
his
love
for
Monimia
,
together
with
the
motive
of
philosophy
and
religion
.
    
<EOS>
while
in
this
manner
he
secretly
nurse
the
worm
of
grief
that
prey
upon
his
vital
,
the
alteration
of
his
countenance
and
conduct
do
not
escape
the
eye
of
that
discern
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
alarm
at
the
change
,
yet
afraid
to
inquire
into
the
source
of
it
;
for
,
be
ignorant
of
his
distress
,
she
could
impute
it
to
no
cause
in
which
her
happiness
be
not
deeply
interested
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
observe
his
strained
complaisance
,
and
extraordinary
emotion
:
she
have
detect
him
in
repeat
attempt
to
avoid
her
company
,
and
take
notice
of
his
regular
excursion
in
the
dark
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
alarm
symptom
to
a
lover
of
her
delicacy
and
pride
:
she
strove
in
vain
to
put
the
most
favourable
construction
on
what
she
see
;
and
finally
,
impute
the
effect
of
his
despondence
to
the
alienation
of
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
make
miserable
beyond
expression
by
these
suspicion
,
she
impart
them
to
Fathom
,
who
by
this
time
be
in
full
possession
of
her
confidence
and
esteem
,
and
implore
his
advice
touch
her
conduct
in
such
a
nice
conjuncture
.
    
<EOS>
this
artful
politician
,
who
rejoice
at
the
effect
of
her
penetration
,
no
sooner
hear
himself
question
on
the
subject
,
than
he
give
token
of
surprize
and
confusion
,
signify
his
concern
to
find
she
have
discover
what
(
for
the
honour
of
his
friend
)
he
wish
have
never
come
to
light
.
 
<EOS>
His
behaviour
on
this
occasion
confirm
her
fatal
conjecture
;
and
she
conjure
him
in
the
most
pathetic
manner
,
to
tell
her
if
he
think
Renaldo
's
heart
have
contract
any
new
engagement
.
    
<EOS>
at
this
question
,
he
start
with
sign
of
extreme
agitation
,
and
stifle
an
artificial
sigh
,
"
sure
,
madam
,
say
he
,
you
can
not
doubt
the
Count
's
constancy
  
<EOS>
I
be
confident
 
he
be
certainly
 
<EOS>
I
protest
,
madam
,
<EOS>
I
be
so
shocked
"
     
<EOS>
here
he
make
a
full
pause
,
as
if
the
conflict
between
his
integrity
and
his
friendship
would
not
allow
him
to
proceed
,
and
summon
the
moisture
into
either
eye
.
   
<EOS>
"
then
be
my
doubt
remove
,
cry
the
afflict
Monimia
:
 
<EOS>
I
see
your
candour
in
the
midst
of
your
attachment
to
Renaldo
,
and
will
no
longer
torment
you
with
impertinent
interrogation
and
vain
complaint
.
<EOS>
"
 
with
these
word
,
a
flood
of
tear
gush
from
her
enchanting
eye
,
and
she
instantly
withdraw
into
her
own
apartment
,
where
she
indulge
her
sorrow
to
excess
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
her
grief
unanimated
with
resentment
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
,
by
birth
,
nature
and
education
,
inspire
with
that
dignity
of
pride
which
ennoble
the
human
heart
;
and
this
,
by
the
circumstance
of
her
present
dependance
,
be
render
extremely
jealous
and
susceptible
:
<EOS>
insomuch
that
she
could
not
brook
the
last
shadow
of
indifference
,
much
less
an
injury
of
such
a
nature
from
the
man
whom
she
have
honour
with
her
affection
,
and
for
whom
she
have
disoblige
and
desert
her
family
and
friend
.
    
<EOS>
though
her
love
be
so
unalterably
fix
on
this
unhappy
youth
that
,
without
the
continuation
of
reciprocal
regard
,
her
life
would
have
become
an
unsupportable
burden
,
even
amidst
all
the
splendour
of
affluence
and
pomp
;
and
<EOS>
altho
'
she
foresee
,
that
when
his
protection
should
cease
,
she
must
be
leave
a
wretched
orphan
in
a
foreign
land
,
expose
to
all
the
misery
of
want
:
yet
,
such
be
the
loftiness
of
her
displeasure
,
that
she
disdain
to
complain
,
or
even
demand
an
explanation
from
the
author
of
her
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
while
she
continue
undetermined
in
her
purpose
,
and
fluctuate
on
this
sea
of
torture
,
Fathom
,
believe
that
now
be
the
season
for
work
upon
her
passion
,
while
they
be
all
in
commotion
,
become
,
if
possible
,
more
assiduous
than
ever
about
the
fair
mourner
,
model
his
feature
into
a
melancholy
cast
,
pretend
to
share
her
distress
with
the
most
emphatic
sympathy
,
and
endeavour
to
keep
her
resentment
glowing
by
cunne
insinuation
,
which
,
tho
'
apparently
design
to
apologize
for
his
friend
,
serve
only
to
aggravate
the
guilt
of
his
perfidy
and
dishonour
.
 
<EOS>
this
pretext
of
friendly
concern
,
be
the
most
effectual
vehicle
for
the
conveyance
of
malice
and
slander
:
 
<EOS>
and
a
man
's
reputation
be
never
so
mortally
stab
,
as
when
the
assassin
begin
with
the
preamble
of
,
"
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
can
safely
say
,
that
no
man
upon
earth
have
a
great
regard
for
him
than
I
have
;
and
it
be
with
the
utmost
anguish
and
concern
that
I
see
him
misbehave
in
such
a
manner
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
then
he
proceed
to
mangle
his
character
,
and
the
good
-
natured
hearer
conclude
he
be
even
blacker
than
he
be
represent
,
on
the
supposition
that
the
most
attrocious
circumstance
be
soften
or
suppress
by
the
tenderness
or
friendship
of
the
accuser
,
exclaim
,
"
good
lack
!
<EOS>
what
a
wretch
he
must
be
when
his
good
friend
will
no
longer
attempt
to
defend
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
sometimes
these
well
-
wisher
undertake
his
defence
,
and
treacherously
betray
the
cause
they
have
espouse
,
by
omit
the
reason
that
may
be
urge
in
his
vindication
.
    
<EOS>
both
these
method
be
practise
by
the
wily
Ferdinand
,
accord
to
the
predominant
passion
of
Monimia
:
when
her
indignation
prevail
,
he
expatiate
upon
his
love
and
sincere
regard
for
Renaldo
,
which
,
he
say
,
have
grow
up
from
the
cradle
,
to
such
a
degree
of
fervour
,
that
he
would
willingly
part
with
life
for
his
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
He
shed
his
tear
for
his
apostacy
;
but
every
drop
make
an
indelible
stain
upon
his
character
:
and
,
in
the
bitterness
of
his
grief
,
swear
,
notwithstanding
his
fondness
for
Renaldo
,
which
have
become
a
part
of
his
constitution
,
that
the
young
Hungarian
deserve
the
most
infamous
destiny
,
for
have
injure
such
perfection
.
 
<EOS>
at
other
time
,
when
he
find
her
melt
into
silent
sorrow
,
he
affect
to
excuse
the
conduct
of
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
He
inform
her
,
that
the
young
gentleman
's
temper
have
be
uneven
from
his
infancy
<EOS>
:
that
frailty
be
natural
to
man
;
that
he
may
in
time
be
reclaim
by
self
-
conviction
;
he
even
hint
,
that
she
may
have
probably
ascribe
to
inconstancy
,
what
be
really
the
effect
of
some
chagrin
which
he
industriously
conceal
from
her
participation
:
<EOS>
but
,
when
he
find
her
dispose
to
listen
to
this
last
suggestion
,
he
destroy
the
force
of
it
,
by
recollect
the
circumstance
of
his
nocturnal
ramble
,
which
,
he
own
,
would
admit
of
no
favourable
construction
.
    
<EOS>
by
these
mean
he
blow
the
coal
of
her
jealousy
,
and
inhance
the
value
of
his
own
character
,
at
the
same
time
;
for
she
look
upon
him
as
a
mirror
of
faith
and
integrity
,
and
the
mind
be
overcharge
with
woe
,
naturally
seek
some
confident
,
upon
whose
sympathy
it
can
repose
itself
:
indeed
,
his
great
aim
be
,
to
make
himself
necessary
to
her
affliction
,
and
settle
a
gossip
correspondence
,
in
the
familiarity
of
which
he
hope
his
purpose
would
certainly
be
answer
.
    
<EOS>
yet
the
exertion
of
these
talent
be
not
limit
to
her
alone
.
 
<EOS>
while
he
lay
these
train
for
the
hapless
young
lady
,
he
be
prepare
snare
of
another
kind
for
her
unsuspecting
lover
,
who
(
for
the
completion
of
his
misery
)
about
this
time
begin
to
perceive
mark
of
disquiet
and
displeasure
in
the
countenance
and
deportment
of
his
adore
Monimia
:
for
,
that
young
lady
,
in
the
midst
of
her
grief
,
remember
her
origin
,
and
over
her
vexation
affect
to
throw
a
veil
of
tranquillity
,
which
serve
only
to
give
an
air
of
disgust
to
her
internal
disturbance
.
    
<EOS>
Renaldo
,
whose
patence
and
philosophy
be
barely
sufficient
to
bear
the
load
of
his
other
evil
,
would
have
ben
quite
overwhelmed
with
the
additional
burthen
of
Monimia
's
woe
<EOS>
,
if
it
have
not
assume
this
appearance
of
disesteem
,
which
,
as
he
know
he
have
not
deserve
it
,
bring
his
resentment
to
his
assistance
:
 
yet
this
be
but
a
wretched
cordial
to
support
him
against
the
baleful
reflection
that
assault
him
from
every
quarter
;
it
operate
like
those
desperate
remedy
,
which
while
they
stimulate
exhausted
nature
,
help
to
destroy
the
very
fundamental
of
the
constitution
.
 
<EOS>
He
review
his
own
conduct
with
the
utmost
severity
,
and
could
not
recollect
one
circumstance
which
could
justly
offend
the
idol
of
his
soul
.
 
<EOS>
the
more
blameless
he
appear
to
himself
in
this
examination
,
the
less
excusable
do
her
behaviour
appear
:
    
He
task
his
penetration
to
discover
the
cause
of
this
alteration
<EOS>
;
he
burn
with
impatience
to
know
it
;
his
discernment
fail
him
,
and
he
be
afraid
(
tho
'
he
know
not
why
)
to
demand
an
explanation
.
 
<EOS>
His
thought
be
so
circumstance
,
that
he
durst
not
even
unbosom
himself
to
Fathom
,
tho
'
<EOS>
his
own
virtue
and
friendship
resist
those
sentiment
that
begin
to
intrude
upon
his
mind
,
with
suggestion
to
the
prejudice
of
our
adventurer
's
fidelity
.
    
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
unable
to
endure
the
torment
of
such
interesting
suspence
,
he
,
at
length
,
make
an
effort
to
expostulate
with
the
fair
orphan
;
and
in
an
abrupt
address
,
the
effect
of
his
fear
and
confusion
,
beg
to
know
if
he
have
inadvertently
do
any
thing
to
incur
her
displeasure
.
 
<EOS>
Monimia
,
hear
herself
bluntly
accost
in
this
unusual
strain
,
after
repeat
instance
of
his
reserve
and
suppose
inconstancy
,
consider
the
question
as
a
fresh
insult
,
and
summon
her
whole
pride
to
her
assistance
,
reply
with
affected
tranquillity
,
or
rather
with
an
air
of
scorn
,
that
she
have
no
title
to
judge
,
neither
do
she
pretend
to
condemn
his
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
this
answer
,
so
wide
of
that
tenderness
and
concern
which
have
hitherto
manifest
itself
in
the
disposition
of
his
amiable
mistress
,
deprive
him
of
all
power
to
carry
on
the
conversation
,
and
he
retire
with
a
low
bow
,
fully
convinced
of
his
have
irretrievably
lose
the
place
he
have
possess
in
her
affection
;
for
,
to
his
imagination
,
warp
and
blind
by
his
misfortune
,
her
demeanour
seem
fraught
,
not
with
a
transient
gleam
of
anger
,
which
a
respectful
lover
would
soon
have
appease
,
but
with
that
contempt
and
indifference
which
denote
a
total
absence
of
affection
and
esteem
.
    
<EOS>
She
,
on
the
other
hand
,
misconstrue
his
sudden
retreat
;
and
now
they
beheld
the
action
of
each
other
thro
'
the
false
medium
of
prejudice
and
resentment
.
 
<EOS>
to
such
fatal
misunderstanding
,
the
peace
and
happiness
of
whole
family
often
fall
a
sacrifice
.
     
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
become
absolute
in
his
power
over
the
passion
of
his
friend
;
and
effect
one
half
of
his
aim
.
   
<EOS>
influence
by
this
dire
mistake
,
the
breast
of
those
unhappy
lover
begin
to
be
invade
with
the
horror
of
jealousy
:
the
tender
-
hearted
Monimia
endeavour
to
devour
her
griefs
in
silence
;
she
in
secret
bemoan
her
forlon
fate
,
without
cease
;
her
tear
flow
without
intermission
from
night
to
morn
,
and
from
morn
to
night
:
    
<EOS>
She
seek
not
to
know
the
object
for
which
she
be
forsake
;
she
mean
not
to
upbraid
her
undoer
;
her
aim
be
to
find
a
sequestered
corner
,
in
which
she
could
indulge
her
sorrow
,
where
she
could
brood
over
the
melancholy
remembrance
of
her
former
felicity
,
where
she
could
recollect
those
happy
scene
she
have
enjoy
under
the
wing
of
her
indulgent
parent
,
when
her
whole
life
be
a
revolution
of
pleasure
,
and
she
be
surround
with
affluence
,
pomp
and
admiration
;
where
she
could
,
unmoleste
,
dwell
upon
the
wretched
comparison
between
her
past
and
present
condition
,
and
paint
every
circumstance
of
her
misery
in
the
most
aggravating
colour
,
that
they
may
make
the
deep
impression
upon
her
mind
,
and
the
more
speedily
contribute
to
that
dissolution
for
which
she
ardently
wish
,
as
a
total
release
from
woe
.
 
<EOS>
amidst
these
pining
,
she
begin
to
loath
all
sustenance
;
her
cheek
grow
wan
,
<EOS>
her
bright
eye
lose
their
splendor
,
the
rose
vanish
from
her
lip
,
and
her
delicate
limb
could
hardly
support
their
burthen
;
in
a
word
,
her
sole
consolation
be
limit
to
the
prospect
of
deposit
her
sorrow
in
the
grave
;
and
her
only
wish
be
to
procure
a
retreat
in
which
she
may
wait
with
resignation
for
that
happy
period
.
 
<EOS>
yet
this
melancholly
comfort
she
could
not
obtain
without
the
advice
and
mediation
of
Fathom
,
whom
she
therefore
still
continue
to
see
and
consult
.
 
<EOS>
while
these
consultation
be
hold
,
Renaldo
's
bosom
be
ravage
with
tempest
of
rage
and
distraction
.
 
<EOS>
He
believe
himself
supersede
in
the
affection
of
his
mistress
,
by
some
favour
rival
,
whose
success
rankle
his
soul
;
and
tho
'
<EOS>
he
scarce
durst
communicate
the
suspicion
to
his
own
heart
,
his
observation
continually
whisper
to
him
,
that
he
be
supplant
by
his
friend
Fathom
;
for
Monimia
be
totally
detach
from
the
conversation
of
every
other
man
,
and
he
have
of
late
note
their
intercourse
with
distemper
eye
.
    
<EOS>
these
consideration
sometimes
transport
him
to
such
a
degree
of
frenzy
,
that
he
be
tempt
to
sacrifice
them
both
as
traitor
to
gratitude
,
friendship
,
and
love
;
but
such
delirium
soon
vanish
before
his
honour
and
humanity
.
    
<EOS>
He
would
not
allow
himself
to
think
amiss
of
Ferdinand
,
until
some
undoubted
mark
of
his
guilt
should
appear
;
and
this
be
so
far
from
be
the
case
,
that
hitherto
there
be
scarce
a
presumption
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
(
say
he
to
himself
)
<EOS>
I
be
hourly
receive
proof
of
his
sympathy
and
attachment
:
 
<EOS>
not
but
that
he
may
be
the
innocent
cause
of
my
mishap
.
 
<EOS>
His
superior
qualification
may
have
attract
the
eye
,
and
engage
the
heart
of
that
inconstant
fair
,
without
his
be
sensible
of
the
victory
he
have
win
;
or
,
perhaps
,
shock
at
the
conquest
he
hath
unwillingly
make
,
he
discourage
her
advance
,
try
to
reason
down
her
unjustifiable
passion
,
and
in
the
mean
time
,
conceal
from
me
the
particular
,
out
of
regard
to
my
happiness
and
quiet
.
    
<EOS>
under
cover
of
these
favourable
conjecture
our
adventurer
securely
prosecute
his
scheme
upon
the
unfortunate
Monimia
.
 
<EOS>
He
dedicate
himself
wholly
to
her
service
and
conversation
,
except
at
those
time
when
his
company
be
request
by
Renaldo
,
who
now
very
seldom
exact
his
attendance
:
 
in
his
ministry
about
the
person
of
the
beauteous
orphan
,
<EOS>
this
cunne
incendiary
mingle
such
awful
regard
,
such
melt
compassion
,
as
effectually
screen
him
from
the
suspicion
of
treachery
,
while
he
widen
the
fatal
breach
between
her
and
her
lover
,
by
the
most
diabolical
insinuation
.
    
<EOS>
He
represent
his
friend
as
a
voluptuary
,
who
gratify
his
own
appetite
without
the
least
regard
to
honour
or
conscience
:
and
with
a
shew
of
infinite
reluctance
impart
some
anecdote
of
his
sensuality
,
which
he
have
feign
for
the
purpose
;
then
he
would
exclaim
in
an
affected
transport
,
"
Gracious
heaven
!
<EOS>
be
it
possible
for
any
man
who
have
the
least
title
to
perception
or
humanity
,
to
injure
such
innocence
and
perfection
?
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
have
I
be
so
undeservedly
happy
 
<EOS>
heaven
and
earth
!
 
<EOS>
forgive
<EOS>
my
transport
madam
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
help
see
and
admire
such
divine
attraction
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
resent
your
wrong
;
it
be
the
cause
of
virtue
<EOS>
I
espouse
;
it
ought
to
be
the
cause
of
every
honest
man
.
"
    
<EOS>
He
have
often
repeat
such
apostrophe
as
these
,
which
she
ascribe
to
nothing
else
than
sheer
benevolence
and
virtuous
indignation
,
and
actually
begin
to
think
he
have
make
some
impression
upon
her
heart
;
not
that
he
now
entertain
the
hope
of
an
immediate
triumph
over
her
chastity
.
 
<EOS>
the
more
he
contemplate
her
character
,
the
more
difficult
the
conquest
seem
to
be
;
he
therefore
alter
his
plan
,
and
resolve
to
carry
on
his
operation
,
under
the
shelter
of
honourable
proposal
,
foresee
that
a
wife
of
her
qualification
,
if
properly
manage
,
would
turn
greatly
to
the
account
of
the
husband
;
or
if
her
virtue
should
prove
refractory
,
that
he
could
,
at
any
time
,
rid
himself
of
the
incumbrance
,
by
decamp
without
beat
of
drum
,
after
he
should
be
cloy
with
possession
.
    
<EOS>
elevate
by
these
expectation
,
he
,
one
day
,
in
the
midst
of
a
preconcerte
rhapsody
,
import
,
that
he
could
no
longer
conceal
the
fire
that
prey
upon
his
heart
,
throw
himself
on
his
knee
before
the
lovely
mourner
,
and
imprint
a
kiss
on
her
fair
hand
:
    
Tho
<EOS>
'
he
do
not
presume
to
take
this
liberty
,
till
after
such
preparation
as
he
think
have
altogether
extinguish
her
regard
for
Melvil
,
and
pave
the
way
for
his
own
reception
in
room
of
that
discard
lover
;
he
have
so
far
overshot
his
mark
,
that
Monimia
,
instead
of
favour
his
declaration
,
start
up
,
and
retire
in
silence
,
her
cheek
glow
with
shame
,
and
her
eye
gleam
with
indignation
.
    
<EOS>
Ferdinand
no
sooner
recover
from
the
confusion
produce
by
this
unexpected
repulse
,
than
he
see
the
necessity
of
come
to
a
speedy
determination
,
lest
the
offend
fair
one
should
appeal
to
Renaldo
,
in
which
case
they
may
be
mutually
undeceived
,
to
his
utter
shame
and
confusion
;
he
therefore
resolve
to
depreciate
her
anger
,
by
humble
supplication
,
and
by
protest
,
that
whatever
torture
he
may
suffer
by
suppress
his
sentiment
,
she
should
never
again
be
offend
with
a
declaration
of
his
passion
.
    
<EOS>
have
thus
appease
the
gentle
Monimia
,
and
discover
,
that
in
spite
of
her
resentment
,
his
friend
still
keep
possession
of
her
heart
,
he
determine
to
work
an
effectual
seperation
,
so
as
that
the
young
lady
be
utterly
desert
by
Melvil
,
should
be
leave
altogether
in
his
power
.
 
<EOS>
with
this
christian
intention
he
begin
to
sadden
his
visage
with
a
double
shade
of
pensive
melancholy
,
in
the
presence
of
Renaldo
,
to
stifle
a
succession
of
involuntary
sigh
,
to
answer
from
the
purpose
,
to
be
incoherent
in
his
discourse
,
and
in
a
word
,
to
act
the
part
of
a
person
wrapt
up
in
sorrowful
cogitation
.
    
<EOS>
Count
Melvil
,
soon
as
he
perceive
these
symptom
,
very
kindly
enquire
into
the
cause
of
them
,
and
be
not
a
little
alarmed
to
hear
the
artful
and
evasive
answer
of
Ferdinand
,
who
,
without
disclose
the
source
of
his
disquiet
,
earnestly
begg'd
leave
to
retire
into
some
other
corner
of
the
world
.
    
<EOS>
Roused
by
this
intreaty
,
the
Hungarian
's
jealousy
awoke
,
and
with
violent
agitation
he
exclaim
:
 
<EOS>
"
then
be
my
fear
too
true
!
<EOS>
my
dear
Fathom
,
I
comprehend
the
meaning
of
your
request
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
for
some
time
perceive
an
host
of
horror
approach
from
that
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
your
worth
and
honour
.
 
<EOS>
I
depend
upon
your
friendship
,
and
conjure
you
by
all
the
tie
of
it
,
to
free
me
at
once
from
the
most
miserable
suspense
,
by
own
you
have
involuntarily
captivate
the
heart
of
that
unhappy
maiden
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
to
this
solemn
interrogation
he
make
no
reply
;
but
shed
a
flood
of
tear
(
of
which
he
have
always
a
magazine
at
command
)
<EOS>
he
repeat
his
desire
of
withdrawing
,
and
take
God
to
witness
,
that
what
he
propose
be
solely
for
the
quiet
of
his
honoured
patron
and
beloved
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
(
cry
the
unfortunate
Renaldo
)
<EOS>
the
measure
of
my
woe
be
now
fill
up
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
fall
backwards
in
a
swoon
,
from
which
he
be
with
difficulty
recover
to
the
sensation
of
the
most
exquisite
torment
.
 
<EOS>
during
this
paroxysm
,
our
adventurer
nurse
him
with
infinite
care
and
tenderness
;
he
exhort
him
to
summon
all
his
fortitude
to
his
assistance
;
to
remember
his
fore
-
father
,
and
exert
himself
in
the
imitation
of
their
virtue
;
to
fly
from
those
bewitching
charm
which
have
enslave
his
well
part
,
to
retrieve
his
peace
of
mind
,
by
reflect
on
the
inconstancy
and
ingratitude
of
woman
,
and
amuse
his
imagination
in
the
pursuit
of
honour
and
glory
.
    
<EOS>
after
these
admonition
,
he
abuse
his
ear
with
a
forge
detail
of
the
gradual
advance
make
to
him
by
Monimia
,
and
the
step
he
have
take
to
discourage
her
address
,
and
re
-
establish
her
virtue
;
poison
the
mind
of
that
credulous
youth
to
such
a
degree
,
that
in
all
probability
he
would
have
put
a
fatal
period
to
his
own
existence
,
have
not
Fathom
find
mean
to
allay
the
rage
of
his
extasy
,
by
the
cunning
arrangement
of
opposite
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
He
set
his
pride
against
his
love
;
he
oppose
his
resentment
to
his
sorrow
,
and
his
ambition
to
his
despair
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
ballance
of
power
,
so
settle
among
these
antagonist
,
so
violent
be
the
shock
of
their
successive
conflict
,
that
his
bosom
fare
like
a
wretched
province
harrasse
,
depopulate
,
and
lay
waste

by
two
fierce

army
.
 
<EOS>
from
this
moment
,
his
life
be
nothing
but
an
alternation
of
start
and
reverie
;
he
weep
and
rave
by
turn
,
accord
to
the
prevail
gust
of
passion
;
food
become
a
stranger
to
his
lip
,
and
sleep
to
his
eye
-
lid
;
he
could
not
support
the
presence
of
Monimia
;
her
absence
increase
the
torture
of
his
pang
;
and
when
he
meet
her
by
accident
,
he
start
back
with
horror
,
like
a
traveller
who
chance
to
tread
upon
a
snake

<EOS>
the
poor

wear

consume
anguish

eager
to
find
some
lowly
retreat
,
where
she
could
breathe
out
her
soul
in
peace
,
and
terrify
at
the
frantic
behaviour
of
Renaldo
,
communicate
to
Fathom
her
desire
of
removing
,
and
beg
that
he
would
take
a
small
picture
of
her
father
,
decorate
with
diamond
,
and
convert
them
into
money
for
the
expence
of
her
subsistence
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
the
last
pledge
of
her
family
,
which
she
have
receive
from
her
mother

who
have
preserve
it
in
the

of
numberless
distress

no

that
which
she
groan
under

could
have
prevail
upon
the

exclusive
of
other
motive

the

upbraid

upon
a
man

who
have
treat
her
with
such
indignity

ingratitude

<EOS>
besides

"
My
dear
count
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
I
be
not
at
all
surprize
at
your
emotion

because
I
know
what
an
heart
,
susceptible
as
yours
,
must
feel
,
from
the
apostacy
of
one
who
have
reign
so
long

<EOS>
Your
endeavour
to
drive
her
from
your
thought

must
create
an
agony
much
more
severe

than
that
which
divorce
the
soul
from
the
body
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
I
be
so
confident
of
your
virtue
and
your
manhood
,
as
to
foresee
that
you
will
allow
the
frail
Monimia
to
execute
that
resolution
which
she
hath
so
unwisely
take
,
to
withdraw
herself
from
your
love
and
protection
.
 
<EOS>
believe
me
,
my
good
friend

this
be
a
step
,
in
consequence
of
which
you
will
infallibly
retrieve
your
peace

It
may
cost
you
many
bitter
pang

it
may
probe
your

but
those
pang
will
be
soothe
by
the
gentle

salutary
wing
of
time

and
that
probe
will
rouse
you
to
a
due
sense
of
your
own
dignity

will
enable
you
to
convert
your
attention
to
object

all
the
hope

happiness
you
have

be
now
irrecoverably

her

be

without

extinguish

irretrievably
lose

insomuch

that
be
she
to
profess
sorrow
for
her
indiscretion

and
implore
your
forgiveness
,
with
the
most
solemn
promise
of
regard
you
for
the
future
with
unalterable
fidelity
and
affection
,
you
ought
not
to
restore
her
to
that
place
in
your
heart
which
she
hath
so
meanly
forfeit

because
you
could
not
at

reinstate
her
in
the
possession
of
that
delicate

without
which
there
be
no

no

<EOS>
no

my

expel
the
unworthy

Your

vengeance
on

then
dedicate
yourself
to

her
eye
;
not
as
an
inconstant
,
ungenerous
and
perjured
swain
,
but
as
the
accomplish
,
the
virtuous
,
the
melting
lover
,
who
have
captivate
her
virgin
heart
.
 
<EOS>
as
Fathom
lead
her
to
the
door
,
she
be
meet
by
Renaldo
's
dog
,
which
have
long
be
her
favourtie
,
and
the
poor
animimal
fawning
upon
her
as
she
pass
,
her
heart
be
overwhelmed
with
such
a
gush
of
tenderness
,
that
a
flood
of
tear
stream
down
her
cheek
,
and
she
have
well
nigh
sink
upon
the
floor
.
    
<EOS>
Ferdinand
,
consider
this
emotion
as
the
last
tribute
she
would
pay
to
Renaldo
,
hurry
her
into
the
coach
,
where
she
soon
recover
her
composure
;
and
in
a
little
time
he
usher
her
into
the
house
of
madam
la
Mer
,
by
whom
she
be
receive
with
great
cordiality
,
and
conduct
to
her
apartment
,
with
which
she
find
no
other
fault
,
but
that
of
its
be
too
good
for
one
in
her
forlorn
situation
;
here
while
the
tear
of
gratitude
start
in
either
eye
,
she
thank
our
adventurer
for
his
benevolence
and
kind
concern
,
assure
him
that
she
would
not
fail
daily
to
beseech
the
most
high
to
shower
down
blessing
upon
him
as
the
orphan
's
friend
and
protector
.
    
<EOS>
Fathom
be
not
deficient
in
those
expression
that
be
best
adapt
to
her
present
turn
of
mind
;
he
observe
,
that
what
he
have
do
be
in
obedience
to
the
dictate
of
common
humanity
,
which
would
have
prompt
him
to
assist
any
fellow
creature
in
distress
;
but
that
her
peculiar
virtue
and
qualification
be
such
as
challenge
the
utmost
exertion
of
his
faculty
in
her
service
;
he
say
,
that
surely
Heaven
have
not
create
such
perfection
in
vain
;
that
she
be
destine
to
receive
as
well
as
to
communicate
happiness
:
and
that
the
Providence
which
she
so
piously
adore
,
would
not
fail
,
in
due
season
,
to
raise
her
from
distress
and
affliction
,
to
that
honour
and
felicity
for
which
she
be
certainly
ordain
;
in
the
mean
time
he
intreate
her
to
depend
upon
his
service
and
fidelity
,
and
the
article
of
her
board
be
settle
,
he
leave
her
to
the
company
and
consolation
of
her
discreet
hostess
,
who
soon
insinuate
herself
into
the
good
opinion
of
her
beauteous
lodger
.
    
<EOS>
while
our
hero
be
employ
in
this
transaction
,
Renaldo
sally
forth
in
a
sort
of
intoxication
,
which
Fathom
's
admonition
have
inspire
:
and
repair
to
a
certain
note
coffee
-
house
,
engage
at
chess
with
an
old
french
refugee
,
that
his
attention
,
by
be
otherwise
employ
,
may
not
stray
towards
that
fatal
object
which
he
ardently
wish
to
forget
.
    
<EOS>
but
,
unluckily
for
him
,
he
have
scarce
perform
three
move
of
the
game
,
when
his
ear
be
expose
to
a
dialogue
between
two
young
gentleman
;
one
of
whom
ask
the
other
,
if
he
would
go
and
see
the
orphan
act
at
one
of
the
theatre
;
observe
,
as
a
farther
inducement
,
that
the
part
of
Monimia
would
be
perform
by
a
young
gentlewoman
who
have
never
appear
on
the
stage
.
 
<EOS>
at
mention
of
that
name
Renaldo
start
:
for
,
tho
'
it
do
not
properly
belong
to
his
orphan
,
it
be
the
appellation
by
which
she
have
be
distinguish
ever
since
her
separation
from
her
father
's
house
,
and
therefore
it
recall
her
to
his
imagination
in
the
most
interesting
point
of
view
.
 
<EOS>
though
he
endeavour
to
expel
the
image
,
by
a
close
application
to
his
play
,
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
it
intrude
upon
his
fancy
,
and
at
each
return
make
a
strong
impression
;
so
that
he
find
himself
in
the
situation
of
an
unfortunate
bark
strand
upon
some
hide
rock
,
which
,
when
the
wind
begin
to
blow
,
feel
every
succeed
wave
more
boisterous
than
the
former
,
until
,
with
irresistible
fury
,
they
surmount
her
deck
,
sweep
every
thing
before
them
,
and
dash
her
all
to
piece
.
    
<EOS>
the
refugee
have
observe
his
first
emotion
,
which
he
attribute
to
an
unforeseen
advantage
he
himself
have
gain
over
the
hungarian
:
but
see
him
,
in
the
sequel
,
bite
his
lip
,
roll
his
eye
,
groan
,
writhe
his
body
,
ejaculate
incoherent
curse
,
and
neglect
his
game
,
the
Huguenot
conclude
,
that
he
be
mad
;
and
,
be
seize
with
terror
and
dismay
,
get
up
and
scamper
off
without
ceremeny
or
hesitation
.
    
<EOS>
Melvil
,
thus
leave
to
the
horror
of
his
own
thought
,
which
torture
him
with
the
apprehension
of
lose
Monimia
for
ever
,
could
no
longer
combat
that
suggestion
,
but
run
homeward
with
all
the
speed
he
could
exert
,
in
order
to
prevent
her
retreat
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
cross
the
threshold
,
he
be
strike
with
such
a
damp
of
presaging
fear
,
that
he
durst
not
in
person
approach
her
apartment
,
nor
even
,
by
question
the
servant
,
inform
himself
of
the
particular
he
want
to
know
:
yet
his
suspence
become
more
insupportable
than
his
fear
,
he
rush
from
room
to
room
in
quest
of
that
which
be
not
to
be
find
:
and
,
see
Monimia
's
chamber
door
open
,
enter
the
deserted
temple
in
a
state
of
distraction
,
call
aloud
upon
her
name
.
 
<EOS>
all
be
silent
,
solitary
and
woful
,
"
<EOS>
She
be
go
 
(
he
cry
,
shed
a
flood
of
tear
)
  
<EOS>
she
be
for
ever
lose
;
and
all
my
hope
of
happiness
be
flee
!
"
    
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
sink
upon
that
couch
on
which
Monimia
have
oft
repose
,
and
abandon
himself
to
all
the
excess
of
grief
and
despondence
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
deplorable
condition
he
be
find
by
our
adventurer
,
who
gently
chid
him
for
his
want
of
resolution
,
and
again
repel
his
sorrow
,
by
arrouse
his
resentment
against
the
innocent
cause
of
his
disquiet
,
have
beforehand
forge
the
particular
of
provocation
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
it
possible
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
Renaldo
can
still
retain
the
least
sentiment
of
regard
for
a
fickle
woman
,
by
whom
he
have
be
so
ungratefully
forsaken
and
so
unjustly
scorn
?
 
<EOS>
be
it
possible
<EOS>
he
can
be
so
disturb
by
the
loss
of
a
creature
,
who
be
herself
lose
to
all
virtue
and
decorum
?
    
<EOS>
Time
and
reflection
,
my
worthy
friend
,
will
cure
you
of
that
inglorious
malady
:
and
the
future
misconduct
of
that
imprudent
damsel
will
,
doubtless
,
contribute
to
the
recovery
of
your
peace
.
    
<EOS>
Her
behaviour
at
leave
the
house
,
where
she
have
receive
so
many
mark
of
the
most
delicate
affection
,
be
in
all
respect
so
opposite
to
honour
and
decency
,
that
I
could
scarce
refrain
from
tell
her
I
be
shocked
at
her
deportment
,
even
while
she
load
me
with
protestation
of
love
.
 
<EOS>
when
a
woman
's
heart
be
once
depraved
,
she
bid
adieu
to
all
restraint
;
  
she
preserve
no
measure
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
simply
contempt
which
she
express
for
Renaldo
;
she
seem
to
resent
his
be
able
to
live
under
her
disdain
;
and
that
resentment
stoop
to
object
unworthy
of
indignation
.
 
<EOS>
even
your
dog
be
not
exempt
from
the
effect
of
her
displeasure
:
for
,
in
her
passage
to
the
door
,
she
kick
the
poor
animal
as
one
of
your
dependant
;
and
in
our
way
to
the
apartment
I
have
provide
for
her
,
she
entertain
me
with
a
ludicrous
comment
upon
the
manner
in
which
you
first
make
her
acquaint
with
your
passion
.
 
<EOS>
all
that
modesty
of
carriage
,
all
that
chastity
of
conversation
,
all
that
dignity
of
grief
,
which
she
know
so
well
how
to
affect
,
be
now
entirely
lay
aside
,
and
when
I
quit
her
,
she
seem
the
most
gay
,
giddy
and
impertinent
of
her
sex
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
gracious
power
!
<EOS>
(
exclaim
Renaldo
,
start
from
the
couch
)
be
I
under
the
delusion
of
a
dream
;
or
be
these
thing
really
so
,
as
my
friend
have
represent
them
?
 
<EOS>
such
a
total
and
sudden
degeneracy
be
amazing
!
<EOS>
be
monstrous
and
unnatural
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
such
,
my
dear

our

the

Congratulate
yourself
,
therefore
,
my

upon
your
happy
deliverance
from
such
a
domestic
plague
 
upon
the
voluntary
exile

to
night

us
over
a
chearful
bottle

to

morrow
I
will
accompany
you
to
the

of
an
usurer

I
be
informed

no

<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
the
art
of
borrow
further
explain
;
and
an
account
of
a
strange
phaenomenon
.
   
<EOS>
in
this
manner
do
the
artful
incendiary
work
upon
the
passion
of
the
credulous
unsuspecting
Hungarian
,
who
press
him
to
his
breast
with
the
most
cordial
expression
of
friendship
,
call
him
his
guardian
,
his
saviour
,
his
second
father
,
and
give
himself
up
wholly
to
his
advice
.
    
<EOS>
Next
morning
,
accord
to
the
plan
they
have
lay
over
night
,
they
repair
to
a
tavern
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
person
to
whom
our
adventurer
have
be
direct
,
and
be
fortunate
enough
to
find
him
in
the
house
,
transact
a
money
affair
with
a
young
gentleman
who
treat
him
with
his
morning
's
whet
.
    
<EOS>
that
affair
be
negotiate
<EOS>
,
he
adjourn
into
another
room
with
Renaldo
and
his
companion
,
who
be
not
a
little
surprised
to
see
this
minister
of
Plutus
in
the
shape
of
a
young
sprightly
beau
,
trim
up
in
all
the
foppery
of
the
fashion
;
for
they
have
hitherto
always
associate
with
the
idea
of
an
usurer
,
old
age
and
rusty
apparel
.
 
<EOS>
after
diver
modish
congee
,
he
beg
to
know
to
what
he
should
attribute
the
honour
of
their
message
;
when
Ferdinand
,
who
act
the
orator
,
tell
him
,
that
his
friend
Count
Melvil
,
have
occasion
for
a
sum
of
money
,
have
be
direct
to
a
gentleman
of
his
name
,
"
and
I
suppose
,
"
add
he
,
"
you
be
the
son
of
the
person
with
whom
the
affair
be
to
be
negotiate
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
this
petit
maitre
,
with
a
smile
,
"
I
perceive
you
be
surprize
to
see
one
of
my
profession
in
the
appearance
of
a
gentleman
;
and
perhaps
your
wonder
will
not
cease
,
when
I
tell
you
,
that
my
education
be
liberal
,
and
that
I
once
have
the
honour
to
bear
a
commission
in
the
british
army
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
indeed
a
first
lieutenant
of
marines
,
and
will
venture
to
say
,
that
no
officer
in
the
service
be
more
delicate
than
myself
,
in
observe
all
the
punctilio
of
honour
.
 
<EOS>
I
entertain
the
utmost
contempt
for
all
the
trading
part
of
the
nation
,
and
suffer
myself
to
be
run
through
the
body
in
a
duel
,
rather
than
roll
with
a
brother
-
lieutenant
who
be
a
broker
's
son
:
but
,
thank
Heaven
!
<EOS>
I
have
long
ago
conquer
all
those
ridiculous
prejudice
.
 
<EOS>
I
soon
observe
,
that
without
money
there
be
no
respect
,
honour
,
or
convenience
to
be
acquire
in
life
;
that
wealth
amply
supply
the
want
of
wit
,
merit
and
pedigree
,
have
influence
and
pleasure
ever
at
command
;
and
that
the
world
never
fail
to
worship
the
flood
of
affluence
,
without
examine
the
dirty
channel
thro
'
which
it
commonly
flow
.
    
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
the
war
,
find
my
appointment
reduce
to
two
shilling
and
four
-
pence
per
day
,
and
be
addict
to
pleasure
which
I
could
not
possibly
purchase
from
such
a
fund
,
I
sell
my
half
-
pay
for
two
hundred
pound
,
which
I
lend
upon
bond
to
a
young
officer
of
the
same
regiment
,
on
condition
that
he
should
insure
his
life
,
and
restore
one
fourth
part
of
the
sum
by
way
of
premium
.
 
<EOS>
I
happen
to
be
lucky
in
this
first
essay
:
for
the
borrower
,
have
in
six
week
expend
the
money
,
make
an
excursion
on
the
high
-
way
,
be
apprehend
,
try
,
convict
of
felony
,
and
cut
his
own
throat
,
to
prevent
the
shame
of
a
public
execution
;
so
that
his
bond
be
discharge
by
the
insurer
.
    
<EOS>
in
short
,
gentleman
,
when
I
engage
in
this
business
,
I
determine
to
carry
it
on
with
such
spirit
,
as
would
either
make
my
fortune
,
or
entirely
ruin
me
in
a
little
time
;
and
hitherto
my
endeavour
have
be
tolerably
successful
:
nor
do
I
think
my
proceeding
a
whit
more
criminal
or
unjust
,
than
those
of
other
merchant
,
who
strive
to
turn
their
money
to
the
good
account
.
 
<EOS>
the
commodity
I
deal
in
be
cash
,
and
it
be
my
business
to
sell
it
to
the
good
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
a
London
factor
send
a
cargo
of
good
to
market
,
and
if
he
get
two
hundred
per
cent
upon
the
sale
,
he
be
commend
for
his
industry
and
address
.
    
<EOS>
if
I
sell
money
for
one
fourth
part
of
that
profit
,
certain
person
will
be
so
unjust
,
as
to
cry
,
shame
upon
me
,
for
take
such
advantage
of
my
neighbour
's
distress
:
not
consider
,
that
the
trader
take
four
time
the
same
advantage
of
those
people
who
buy
his
cargo
,
tho
'
<EOS>
his
risque
be
not
half
so
great
as
mine
;
and
although
the
money
I
sell
,
perhaps
retrieve
the
borrower
from
the
very
jaws
of
destruction
:
for
example
,
it
be
but
<EOS>
yesterday
I
save
a
worthy
man
from
be
arrest
for
a
sum
of
money
,
for
which
he
have
bail
a
friend
who
treacherously
leave
him
in
the
lurch
:
as
he
do
not
foresee
what
would
happen
,
he
have
make
no
provision
for
the
demand
,
and
his
sphere
of
life
seclude
him
from
all
sort
of
money'd
intercourse
,
he
could
not
raise
the
cash
by
his
credit
in
the
usual
way
of
borrowing
;
so
that
,
without
my

<EOS>
Renaldo
be
not
a
little
pleased
to
hear
this
harrangue
to
which
Fathom
reply
with
many
florid
encomium
upon
the
usurer
's
good
sense
and
humane
disposition
;
then
he
explain
the
errand
of
his
friend

which
be
to
borrow
three
hundred

"
Sir
,
(
say
the
lender
,
address
himself
to
count
Melvil
)
,
I
pretend
to
have
acquire
by
experience
some
skill
in
physiognomy
;
and
though
there
be
some
face
so
deeply
disguise
as
to
baffle
all
the
penetration
of
our
art
,
there
be
other
,
in
which
the
heart
appear
with
such
nakedness
of
integrity
,
as
at
once
to
recommend
it
to
our
good
will
.
   
<EOS>
I
own
your
countenance
<EOS>
prepossess
me
in
your
favour
;
and
you
shall
be
accommodate
,
upon
those
term
from
which
I
never
deviate
,
<EOS>
provide
you
can
find
proper
security
,
that
you
shall
not
quit
the
british
dominion
;
for
that
,
with
me
,
be
a
condition
sine
qua
non
.
"
    
<EOS>
this
be
a
very
disagreeable
declaration
to
Renaldo
,
who
candidly
own
,
that
as
his
concern
lie
upon
the
continent
,
his
purpose
be
to
leave
England
without
delay
.
 
<EOS>
the
usurer
profess
himself
sorry
that
it
be
not
in
his
power
to
oblige
him
;
and
,
in
order
to
prevent
any
farther
importunity
,
assure
them
,
he
have
lay
it
down
as
a
maxim
,
from
which
he
would
never
swerve
,
to
avoid
all
dealing
with
people
whom
(
if
need
should
be
)
he
could
not
sue
by
the
law
of
this
realm

<EOS>
thus
the
intervention
of
one
unlucky
and
unforeseen
circumstance
blast
,
in
an
instant
,
the
bud
hope
of
Melvile
,
who
,
while
his
visage
exhibit
the
most
sorrowful
disappointment
,
beg
to
know
,
if
there
be
any
person
of
his
acquaintance
,
who
may
be
less
scrupulous
in
that
particular
.
    
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
direct
them
to
another
member
of
his
profession
,
and
wish
them
success
,
take
his
leave
with
great
form
and
complaisance
.
    
<EOS>
this
instance
of
politeness
be
,
however
,
no
more
than
a
shift
to
disengage
himself
the
more
easily
from
their
intreatie
:
for
,
when
the
case
be
open
to
the
second
usurer
,
he
bless
himself
from
such
customer
,
and
dismiss
them
with
the
most
mortifying
and
boorish
refusal
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
these
repulse
,
Renaldo
resolve
to
make
one
desperate
push
;
and
,
without
allow
himself
the
least
respite
,
sollicite
,
one
by
one
,
not
few
than
fifteen
person
who
deal
in
this
kind
of
traffic
,
and
his
proposal
be
reject
by
each
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
fatigue
by
the
toil
,
and
exasperate
at
the
ill
success
of
his
expedition
;
and
half
mad
with
the
recollection
of
his
finance
,
which
be
now
drain
to
half
a
crown
,
"
since
we
have
nothing
to

"
cry
he
,
"
from
the
favour
of
Christians
,
let
us
have
recourse
to
the
descendant
of
Judah
.
 
<EOS>
though
they
lie
under
the
general
reproach
of
nation
,
as
a
people
dead
to
virtue
and
benevolence
,
and
wholly
devoted
to
avarice
,
fraud

and
extortion
,
the
most
savage
of

can
not
treat
me
with
more
barbarity
of
indifference

than
I
have
experience
among
those
who

the
author
of
their
reproach

"
    
<EOS>
although
Fathom
look
upon
this
proposal
as
an
extravagant
symptom
of
despair
,
he
affect
to
approve
of
the
scheme
,
and
encourage
Renaldo
with
the
hope
of
succeed
in
another
quarter
,
even
if
this
expedition
should
fail
:
for
,
by
this
time
,
our
adventurer
be
half
resolve
to
export
him
at
his
own
charge
,
rather
than
he
should
be
much
longer
restrict
in
his
design
upon
Monimia
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
be
resolve
to
try
the
experiment
upon
the
child
of
Israel
,
they
betook
themselves
to
the
house
of
a
rich
Jew
,
whose
wealth
they
consider
as
a
proof
of
his
rapaciousness
;
and
,
be
admit
into
his
compte
house
,
they
find
him
,
in
the
midst
of
half
a
dozen
clerk
,
when
Renaldo
,
in
his
imagination
,
liken
him
unto
a
minister
of
darkness
surround
by
his
familiar
,
and
planning
scheme
of
misery
to
be
execute
upon
the
hapless
son
of
man
.
 
<EOS>
in
spite
of
these
suggestion
,
which
be
not
at
all
mitigate
by
the
forbidding
aspect
of
the
Hebrew
,
he
demand
a
private
audience
;
and
,
be
usher
into
another
apartment
,
he
explain
his
business
with
manifest
mark
of
disorder
and
affliction
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
his
confusion
be
in
some
measure
owe
to
the
look
of
the
Jew
,
who
in
the
midst
of
his
exordium
pull
down
his
eye
-
brow
,
which
be
surprisingly
black
and
bushy
,
so
as
,
in
appearance
,
totally
,
to
extinguish
his
vision
,
though
he
be
all
the
time
observe
our
youth
from
behind
those
almost
impenetrable
thicket
.
    
<EOS>
Melvil
have
signify
his
request
,
"
young
gentleman
,
(
say
the
Israelite
,
with
a
most
discordant
voice
)
<EOS>
what
in
the
name
of
goodness
,
could
induce
you
to
come
to
me
,
upon
such
an
errand
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
ever
hear
that
I
lend
money
to
stranger

without
security

"
 
<EOS>
"
no

reply
Renaldo
;
"
nor
do
I
believe
I
should
profit
by
my
application

<EOS>
but
my
affair
be
desperate
;
and
my
proposal
have
be
reject
by
every
Christian
to
whom
they
be

I

to
try
my
fate
among
the

"
    
<EOS>
Fathom
,
alarm
at
this
abrupt
reply
,
which
he
suppose
could
not
fail
to
disgust
the
merchant
,
interpose
in
the
conversation
,
by
make
an
apology
for
the
plain
dealing
of
his
friend
,
who
,
he
say
,
be
sour
and
ruffle
by
his
misfortune
:
then
exert
that
power
of
eloquence
which
he
have
at
command
,
he
expostulate
upon
Renaldo
's
claim
and
expectation
,
describe
the
wrong
he
have
suffer
,
extoll
his
virtue
,
and
draw
a
most
pathetic
picture
of
his
distress
.
    
<EOS>
the
Jew
listen
attentively
for
some
time
;
then
his
eye
-
brow
begin
to
rise
and
fall
alternately
;
he
cough'd
,
sneez'd
,
and
wink
hard
,
"
I
be
plague
,
"
say
he
,
"
with
a
salt
rheum
that
trickle
from
my
eye
without
intermission
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
wipe
the
moisture
from
his
face
,
and
proceed
in
these
word
:
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
your
story
be
plausible
;
and
your
friend
be
a
good
advocate
:
but
,
before
I
give
an
answer
to
your
demand
,
I
must
beg
leave
to
ask
if
you
can
produce
undeniable
evidence
of
your
be
the
identical
person
you
really
assume
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
be
really
the
Count
de
Melvil
,
you
will
excuse
my
caution
:
we
can
not
be
too
much
on
our
guard
against
fraud
;
though
I
must
own
you
have
not
the
air
of
an
impostor
.
"
    
<EOS>
Renaldo
's
eye
begin
to
sparkle
at
this
preliminary
question
;
to
which
he
reply
,
that
he
could
procure
the
testimony
of
the
Emperor
's
minister
,
to
whom
he
have
occasionally
pay
his
respect
since
his
first
arrival
in
England

<EOS>
"
if
that
be
the
case

"
say
the
Jew
,
"
take
the
trouble
to
call
here

eight
o'clock

<EOS>
the
Hungarian
be
so
much
confound
at
this
unexpected
reception
,
that
he
have
not
power
to
thank
the
merchant
for
his
promised
favour
,
but
stand
motionless
and
silent
,
while
the
stream
of
gratitude
run
down
his
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
this
genuine
emotion
of
the
heart
be
of
more
weight
with
the
Jew
,
than
the
eloquent
acknowledgment
which
Ferdinand
take
the
opportunity
of
make
for
his
friend
;
and
he
be
fain
to
dismiss
them
a
little
abruptly
,
in
order
to
prevent
a
second
discharge
of
that
same
rheum
of
which
he
have
already
complain
.
    
<EOS>
Melvil
recollect
all
that
have
happen
as
a
dream
,
which
have
no
foundation
in
truth

and
be
all
day
long
in
a
sort
of
delirium
,
produce
by
the
alternate
gust
of
hope
and
fear
that
still
agitate
his
bosom
:
for
he
be
not
yet
without
apprehension
of
be
again
disappoint
by
some
unlucky
occurrence
.
    
<EOS>
He
do
not
,
however
,
fail
to
be
punctual
to
the
hour
of
his
appointment
,
when
the
Jew
tell
him
,
there
would
be
no
occasion
for

the
ambassador

<EOS>
the
reader
must
appeal
to
his
own
heart
to
acquire
a
just
idea
of
Renaldo
's
feeling
,
when
every
title
of
these
promise
be
fulfil

and
the
merchant
refuse
to
take
one
farthing
by
way
of

himself
with
the
slender
security

He

overwhelm

disposed

more

<EOS>
as

Fathom

he
scruple

impute
all
this
kindness

himself

burthensome
poverty

groan
so
long
;
his
thought

upon
the
various
circumstance

to
collect
themselves
in
a
body

to
resume
their
deliberation
upon
a
subject
which
they

long
accustomed

this

fatal
poison

,
and
that
the
sight
of
her

soften
by
his
reproach
into
tear

would
despel
his
resentment

disable
his
manhood

blow
the
ember
of
his
former

to
such
a
rage

as
would

on

to
push
his

in
England
,
which
he
consider
as
his

and
as
the
land
in
which
(
of
all
other
)
<EOS>
a
man
of
merit
have
the
good
encouragement
.
    
<EOS>
such
be
the
reason
he
alledge
,
for
refuse
to
attend
his
benefactor
,
who
be
himself
eagerly
desirous
of
attain
a
settlement
in
the
island
of
Great
Britain
:
but
our
hero
's
real
motive
for
stay
be
of
a
very
different
complexion
.
   
<EOS>
the
reader
be
already
inform
of
his
aim
upon
the
fair
orphan
,
which
,
at
present
,
be
the
chief
spring
of
his
conduct
:
he
may
also
recollect
such
passage
of
his
life
,
as
be
sufficient
to
deter
him
from
re
-
appear
at
Presburg
or
Vienna
:
<EOS>
but
,
besides
these
reflection
,
he
be
detain
by
a
full
persuasion
that
Renaldo
would
sink
under
the
power
and
influence
of
his
antagonist
,
consequently
be
render
incapable
to
provide
for
his
friend
;
and
that
he
himself
,
fraught
with
wile
and
experience
,
as
he
be
,
could
not
fail
to
make
himself
amend
for
what
he
have
suffer
among
a
people
equally
rich
and
unthinking
.
    
<EOS>
Melvil
have
embrace
our
adventurer
,
and
with
a
deep
sigh
bid
him
take
care
of
the
unfortunate
Monimia
,
commit
himself
to
the
sea
,
and
,
by
the
assistance
of
a
favourable
gale
,
be
,
in
four
hour
,
safely
land
on
the
french
shore
;
while
Fathom
take
post
-
horse
for
London
,
where
he
arrive
that
same
night
,
and
next
day
,
in
the
forenoon
,
go
to
visit
the
beauteous
mourner
,
who
have
as
yet
receive
no
intimation
of
Renaldo
's
departure
or
design
.
 
<EOS>
He
find
her
in
the
attitude
of
write
a
letter
to
her
inconstant
lover
,
the
content
of
which
the
reader
will
be
acquaint
with
in
due
time
.
    
<EOS>
Her
countenance
,
notwithstanding
the
veil
of
melancholy
by
which
it
be
overcast
,
seem
altogether
serene
and
compose
;
she
be
the
picture
of
pious
resignation
,
and
sit
like
Patience
on
a
monument
,
smile
at
grief
.
 
<EOS>
after
have
pay
the
compliment
of
the
morning
,
Fathom
beg
pardon
for
have
omit
to
visit
her
during
three
day
,
in
which
,
he
say
,
his
time
have
be
wholly
engross
in
procure
a
proper
equipage
for
Count
Melvil
,
who
have
at
last
bid
an
eternal
adieu
to
the
island
of
Great
Britain
.
    
<EOS>
at
this
information
the
hapless
Monimia
fall
back
in
her
chair
,
and
continue
some
minute
in
a
swoon
;
from
which
be
recover
,
"
excuse
me
,
Mr
Fathom
(
cry
she
,
with
a
deep
sigh
)
;
this
,
I
hope
,
be
the
last
agony
I
shall
feel
from
my
unhappy
passion
.
"
   
<EOS>
then
wipe
the
tear
from
her
lovely
eye
,
she
retrieve
her
tranquillity
,
and
desire
to
know
by
what
mean
Renaldo
have
be
enable
to
undertake
his
journey
into
the
empire
.
 
<EOS>
Our
hero
,
upon
this
occasion
,
assume
the
whole
merit
of
have
promote
the
interest
of
his
friend
,
by
give
her
to
understand
,
that
he
,
in
consequence
of
an
unforeseen
windfall
,
have
defray
the
expence
of
the
Count
's
equipment
;
though
he
observe
,
that
it
be
not
without
reluctance
he
see
Renaldo
make
a
wrong
use
of
his
friendship
.
    
<EOS>
"
although
I
be
happy
(
proceed
this
artful
traitor
)
in
be
able
to
discharge
my
obligation
to
the
house
of
Melvil
,
I
could
not
help
feel
the
most
sensible
chagrin
,
when
I
see
my
assistance
render
subservient
to
the
triumph
of
the
youth
's
baseness
and
infidelity
;
for
he
choose
,
as
the
companion
of
his
travel
,
the
abandon
woman
,
for
whom
he
have
forsake
the
all
-
perfect
Monimia
,
whose
virtue
and
accomplishment
do
not
preserve
her
sacred
from
his
ungrateful
sarcasm
and
unmannerly
ridicule
.
 
<EOS>
believe
me
,
madam
,
I
be
so
shocked
at
his
conversation
on
that
subject
,
and
so
much
incensed
at
his
want
of
delicacy
,
that
my
temper
be
scarce
sufficient
for
the
ceremony
of
parting
;
and
now
that
my
debt
to
his
family
be
overpay
,
I
have
solemnly
renounce
his
correspondence
.

"
    
<EOS>
when
she
hear
that
,
instead
of
betray
the
least
symptom
of
regret
or
compassion
for
her
unhappy
fate
,
the
perfidious
youth
have
exult
over
her
fall
,
and
even
make
her
a
subject
for
his
mirth
,
the
blood
revisit
her
fade
cheek
,
and
resentment
restore
to
her
eye
that
poignancy
which
sorrow
have
before
overcome

yet
she
scorn'd
to
give
speech
to
her
indignation
;
but
force
a
smile
,
"
why
should
I
repine
,
"
say
she
,
"
at
the
mortification
of
a
life

have
recall
all

not

contemptuously

this
life

for

punctilio

honour
the
dear
idea

<EOS>
I
beheld
your
unrivalled
charm
,
and
deeply
feel
their
power
:
yet
,
while
a
possibility
of
Melvil
's
reformation
remain
,
and
while
I
be
restrain
by
my
niggard
fortune

from
make
a
tender
worthy

your
acceptance

I
combat
with
my
inclination

without

hopeless

now
that

by
the

will
of
a
worthy
nobleman

with

I
presume
to
lay
myself
at
the
foot
of
the
adorable
Monimia

as
the
most
faithful
of
admirer

whose
happiness

misery
wholly
depend
upon
her
nod

<EOS>
believe
me
,
Madam

these
be
not
the
profession
of
idle
gallantry
 
<EOS>
I
speak
the
genuine
,

imperfect
language
of
my
heart
:
word
even
the
most
pathetic
can
not
do
justice
to
my
love

<EOS>
I
gaze
upon
your
beauty
with
ravishment
;
but
<EOS>
,
I
contemplate
the
grace
of
your
soul
with
such
awful
veneration
,
that
I
tremble
while
I
approach
you
,
as
if

<EOS>
during
this
declaration
,
which
be
pronounce
in
the
most
emphatic
manner
,
Monimia
be
successively
agitate
with
shame
,
anger
and
grief
:
nevertheless
,
she
summon
her
whole
philosophy
to
her
aid
,
and
with
a
tranquil
,
though
determined
air
,
beg
he
would
not
diminish
the
obligation
he
have
already
confer
,
by
disturb
with
such
unseasonable
address
,
a
poor
unhappy
maid
,
who
have
detach
all
her
thought
from
earthly
object
,
and
wait
impatiently
for
that
dissolution
which
alone
could
put
a
period
to
her
misfortune
.
    
<EOS>
Fathom
,
imagine
that
these
be
no
other
than
the
suggestion
of
a
temporary
disappointment
and
despondence
,
which
it
be
his
business
to
oppose
with
all
his
eloquence
and
art
,
renew
his
theme
with
redouble
ardour
,
and
at
last
become
so
importunate
in
his
desire
,
that
Monimia
,
provoke
beyond
the
power
of
conceal
her
resentment
,
say
,
she
be
heartily
sorry
to
find
herself
under
the
necessity
of
tell
him
,
that
,
in
the
midst
of
her
misfortune
,
she
could
not
help
remember
what
she
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
then
rise
from
her
seat
with
all
the
dignity
of
displeasure
;
"
perhaps
,
"
add
she
,
"
you
have
forget
who
be
the
father
of
the
once
-
happy
Monimia
.
"
    
<EOS>
with
these
word
she
retire
into
another
chamber
,
leave
our
adventurer
confound
by
the
repulse
he
have
sustain
.
 
<EOS>
not
that
he
be
discourage
from
prosecute
his
aim
:
on
the
contrary
,
this
rebuff
seem
to
add
fresh
vigour
to
his
operation
.
 
<EOS>
He
now
think
it
high
time
to
bring
over
Madam
la
Mer
to
his
interest
;
and
,
to
facilitate
her
conversion
,
take
an
opportunity
of
bribe
her
with
some
inconsiderable
present
,
after
have
amuse
her
with
a
plausible
tale
of
his
passion
for
Monimia
,
with
whom
she
undertake
the
office
of
his
mediatrix
,
on
the
supposition
that
his
intention
be
honourable
,
and
highly
advantageous
to
her
lodger
.
    
<EOS>
She
be
,
first
of
all
,
invest
with
the
office
of
obtain
pardon
for
the
offence
he
have
give
;
and
in
this
negotiation
she
succeed
so
well
,
as
to
become
an
advocate
for
his
suit
:
accordingly
,
she
take
all
occasion
of
magnify
his
praise
.
    
<EOS>
His
agreeable
person
be
often
the
subject
of
her
discourse
to
the
fair
mourner
:
her
admiration
dwell
upon
his
politeness
,
good
sense
,
and
win
deportment
:
<EOS>
and
she
every
day
retail
little
story
of
his
benevolence
and
greatness
of
soul
.
 
<EOS>
the
defect
in
his
birth
she
represent
as
a
circumstance
altogether
foreign
from
the
consideration
of
his
merit
;
especially
in
a
nation
where
such
distinction
be
as
little
respected
as
they
will
be
in
a
future
state
.
 
<EOS>
She
mention
several
person
of
note
,
who
bask
in
the
sun
-
shine
of
power
and
fortune
,
without
have
enjoy
the
least
hereditary
assistance
from
their
fore
father
.
 
<EOS>
one
,
she
say
,
spring
from
the
loin
of
an
obscure
attorney
,
another
be
the
grandson
of
a
valet
de
chambre
,
a
third
be
the
issue
of
an
accomptant
,
and
a
fourth
the
offspring
of
an
woolen
-
draper
:
all
these
be
the
child
of
their
own
good
work
,
and
have
raise
themselves
upon
their
personal
virtue
and
address
;
a
foundation
certainly
more
solid
and
honourable
,
than
a
vague
inheritance
derive
from
ancestor
,
in
whose
desert
they
could
not
be
suppose
to
have
bear
the
least
share
.
    
<EOS>
Monimia
listen
to
all
these
argument
with
great
patience
and
affability
,
though
she
at
once
dive
into
the
source
from
which
all
such
insinuation
flow
;
she
join
in
the
commendation
of
Fathom
,
and
own
herself
a
particular
instance
of
that
benevolence
which
the
old
lady
have
so
justly
extoll
;
but
,
once
for
all
,
to
prevent
the
supplication
which
Madam
la
Mer
be
about
to
make
,
she
solemnly
protest
,
that
her
heart
be
altogether
shut
against
any
other
earthly
engagement
;
and
that
her
thought
be
entirely
employ
upon
her
eternal
salvation
.
    
<EOS>
the
assiduous
landlady
perceive
the
steadiness
of
her
disposition
,
think
proper
to
alter
her
method
of
proceeding
,
and
,
for
the
present
,
suspend
that
theme
by
which
she
find
her
fair
lodger
disoblige
.
 
<EOS>
resolve
to
reconcile
Monimia
to
life
,
before
she
would
again
recommend
Ferdinand
to
her
love
,
she
endeavour
to
amuse
her
imagination
,
by
recount
the
occasional
incident
of
the
day
,
hope
gradually
to
decoy
her
attention
to
those
sublunary
object
from
which
it
have
be
industriously
wean
:
she
season
her
conversation
with
agreeable
sally
;
enlarge
upon
the
different
scene
of
pleasure
and
deversion
appertain
to
this
great
metropolis
:
practise
upon
her
palate
,
with
the
delicacy
of
eat
;
endeavour
to
shake
her
temperance
with
repeat
proffer
and
recommendation
of
certain
cordial
and
restorative
which
she
alledge
be
necessary
for
the
recovery
of
her
health
;
and
press
her
to
make
little
excursion
into
the
field
that
skirt
the
town
,
for
the
benefit
of
air
and
exercise
.
    
<EOS>
while
this
auxiliary
ply
the
disconsolate
Monimia
on
one
hand
,
Fathom
be
not
remiss
on
the
other
;
he
now
seem
to
have
sacrifice
his
passion
to
her
quiet
;
his
discourse
turn
upon
more
indifferent
subject
;
he
endeavour
to
dispel
her
melancholy
with
argument
draw
from
philosophy
and
religion
:
on
some
occasion
,
he
display
all
his
fund
of
good
humour
,
with
a
view
to
beguile
her
sorrow
;
he
importune
her
to
give
him
the
pleasure
of
"
squire
her
to
some
place
of
innocent
entertainment
;
and
finally
,
insist
upon
her
accept
a
pecuniary
reinforcement
to
her
finance
,
which
he
know
to
be
in
a
most
consumptive
condition
.
     
<EOS>
Monimia
's
honour
be
protect
by
the
interposition
of
Heaven
.
   
<EOS>
with
that
complacency
and
fortitude
which
be
peculiar
to
herself
,
this
hapless
stranger
resist
all
those
artful
temptation
.
 
<EOS>
Her
sustenance
be
barely
such
as
exempt
her
from
the
guilt
of
be
accessory
to
her
own
death
:
her
drink
be
the
simple
element
:
she
encourage
no
discourse
but
<EOS>
that
which
turn
upon
the
concern
of
her
immortal
part
;
she
never
go
abroad
,
except
in
visit
to
a
french
chapel
in
the
neighbourhood
;
she
refuse
the
proffer
assistance
of
our
adventurer
with
equal
obstinacy
and
politeness
,
and
with
pleasure
see
herself
waste
towards
that
period
of
mortality
which
be
the
consummation
of
her
wish
.
 
<EOS>
yet
her
charm
,
far
from
melt
away
with
her
constitution
,
seem
to
triumph
over
the
decay
of
nature
;
her
shape
and
feature
still
retain
that
harmony
for
which
they
have
always
be
distinguish
;
a
mixture
of
majesty
and
sweetness
diffuse
itself
in
her
look
,
and
her
feebleness
add
to
that
soft
and
feminine
grace
which
attract
the
sympathy
,
and
engage
the
protection
of
every
humane
beholder
.
 
<EOS>
the
associate
,
thus
baffle
in
their
attempt
to
excite
her
idea
of
pleasure
,
again
shift
their
plan
,
and
resolve
to
attack
this
forlorn
beauty
,
on
the
side
of
fear
and
mortification
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
become
less
frequent
in
his
visit
,
and
more
indifferent
in
his
language
and
deportment
;
while
Madam
la
Mer
gradually
relax
in
that
complacency
and
respect
with
which
she
have
hitherto
behave
towards
her
fair
lodger
.
 
<EOS>
She
even
begin
to
drop
hint
of
disapprobation
and
reproach
against
this
pattern
of
innocence
and
beauty
,
and
at
length
grow
bold
enough
to
tell
her
,
that
her
misfortune
could
be
attribute
to
nothing
but
her
own
obstinacy
and
pride
;
that
she
have
be
at
great
pain
to
disoblige
the
only
person
who
be
able
and
willing
to
raise
her
above
dependance
;
and
that
if
his
protection
should
be
withdraw
,
she
must
be
expose
to
the
utmost
extremity
of
distress
.
    
<EOS>
these
insinuation
,
instead
of
produce
the
desire

,
inflame
the
indignation
of
Monimia
,
who
,
in
a
most
dignified
stile
of
rebuke
,
chid
her
for
her
indelicacy
and
presumption
,
observe
,
that
she
could
have
no
title
to
take
such
freedom
with
lodger
,
whose
punctuality
and
regular
deportment
leave
her
no
room
to
complain
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
animate
reply
,
she
undergo
the
most
deplorable
anguish
,
when
she
reflect
upon
the
insolence
of
this
woman
,
from
whose
barbarity
she
have
no
resource
;
and
see
no
other
possibility
of
redress
,
than
that
of
appeal
to
the
good
office
of
Fathom
,
she
conquer
her
reluctance
so
far
,
as
to
complain
to
him
of
Madam
la
Mer
's
incivility
.
    
<EOS>
please
with
this
application
,
he
give
her
to
understand
,
with
very
little
ceremony
or
preamble
,
that
it
wholly
depend
upon
herself
,
whether
she
should
continue
to
be
wretched
,
or
be
deliver
at
once
from
all
her
care
and
perplexity
;
that
,
notwithstanding
the
disdain
with
which
she
have
treat
his
address
,
he
be
still
ready
to
lay
himself
and
his
fortune
at
her
foot
;
and
that
if
she
should
again
reject
the
disinterested
proposal
,
the
whole
world
,
and
her
own
conscience
,
would
charge
upon
herself
,
whatever
calamity
she
may
be
subject
to
in
the
sequel
.
 
<EOS>
interpret
into
a
favourable
hesitation
her
silence
,
which
be
the
result
of
wrath
and
amazement
,
he
proceed
to
throw
himself
at
her
foot
,
and
utter
a
romantic
rhapsody
,
in
the
course
of
which
,
lay
aside
all
that
restraint
which
he
have
hitherto
preserve
,
he
seize
her
delicate
hand
,
and
press
it
to
his
lip
;
nay
,
so
far
do
he
forget
himself
on
this
occasion
,
that
he
catch
the
fair
creature
in
his
arm
,
and
rudely
ravish
a
kiss
from
those
lip
which
he
have
before
contemplate
with
the
most
distant
reverence
of
desire
.
    
<EOS>
have
thus
break
down
the
fence
of
decorum
,
and
be
heat
with
transport
,
he
,
in
all
probability
,
would
have
act
the
part
of
young
Tarquin
,
and
violate
,
by
force
,
that
sacred
shrine
of
honour
,
beauty
,
and
unblemished
truth
,
have
not
the
wrath
kindle
by
such
an
unexpected
outrage
,
inspire
her
with
strength
and
spirit
sufficient
to
protect
her
virtue
,
and
intimidate
the
ruffian
who
could
offer
violence
to
such
perfection
.
    
<EOS>
She
break
from
his
detest
embrace
,
with
surprising
agility
,
and
call
aloud
to
her
landlady
for
assistance
;
but
that
discreet
matron
be
resolve
to
hear
nothing
,
and
Fathom
's
appetite
be
whet
to
a
most
brutal
degree
of
eagerness
,
"
Madam
,
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
all

vain
;
what
you

you
shall
yield
to
my
power

and
I
be
determined
to
force
you
to
your

"
    
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
spring
towards
her
,
with
the
most
savage
and
impious
intent
,
when
this
amiable
heroine
snatch
up
his
sword

which
lie
upon
a
by

table
,
and
unsheathe
it
instantaneously
,
present
the
point
to
his

and
while

with
intolerable
keenness
,
"

<EOS>
He

his
bodily
danger
,
as

at
the
manner
of

and
the
appearance
of

with
something
supernatural

and

his
whole

insomuch
that
he
retreat
without
attempt
to
make
the
least
reply
;
and
she
have
secure
the
door
after
his
departure
,
sit
down
to
ponder
upon
this
shocking
event

<EOS>

<EOS>
common

an
agreeable
reverie
to
what

in
a
foreign

where
she
know
not
one
person
to
whose
protection
she
could
have
recourse

from
the
inexpressible
woe
that
environ

that
her
life
be
protract
for
the
augmentation
of
that
misery
which

already
too
severe

<EOS>
these
be

up
in
all
the

that
they
suffer
not

<EOS>
have
pass
the
night
in
such
agony
,
she
rise
at
day
-
break
,
and
hear
the

bell

prayer

resolve
to
go
to
this
place
of
worship
,
in
order
to
implore
the
assistance
of
heaven
<EOS>
:
she
no
sooner
open
her
chamber
door
,
with
this
intent
,
than
she
be
meet
by
Madam

,
who
after
have
profess
her
concern
for
what
have
happen
over
night
,
and
impute
Mr

's
rudeness
to
the
spirit
of
intoxication
,
by
which
she
have
never

<EOS>
thus
attend
,
the
hapless
mourner
enter
the
place
,
and
accord
to
the
laudable
hospitality
of
England
,
which
be
the
only
country
in
Christendom
,
where
a
stranger
be
not
make
welcome
to
the
house
of
God
;
this
amiable
creature
,
emaciate
and
enfeeble
as
she
be
,
must
have
stand
in
a
common
passage
during
the
whole

by
a
humane
gentlewoman

her
beauty

with
sympathy

at
the
ineffable
sorrow

visible
in

countenance
,
open
the
pew
in
which
she
sit

and
accommodate
Monimia
and
her
attendant

if
she
be
captivate
by
her
first
appearance
,
she
be
not
less
affect
by
the
deportment
of
her
fair
guest
,
which
be
the
pattern
of
genuine
devotion
.
    
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
this
good
lady
,
who
be
a
merchant
's
widow
in
opulent
circumstance
,
be
inflame
with
a
long
desire
to
know
and
befriend
the
amiable
stranger
,
who
,
after
service
,
turn
about
to
thank
her
for
her
civility
,
Madam
Clement
,
with
that
frankness
which
be
the
result
of
true
benevolence
,
tell
her
,
<EOS>
she
be
too
much
prepossess
in
her
favour
,
to
let
slip
this
opportunity
of
crave
her
acquaintance
,
and
of
express
her
inclination
to
alleviate
(
if
possible
)
<EOS>
that
affliction
which
be
manifest
in
her
look
.
    
<EOS>
Monimia
,
overwhelm
with
gratitude
and
surprize
,
at
this
unexpected
address
,
gaze
upon
the
lady
in
silence
,
and
when
she
repeat
her
tender
of
service
,
could
make
no
other
reply
to
her
goodness
,
than
by
burst
into
a
flood
of
tear
:
    
<EOS>
this
be
a
species
of
eloquence
,
which
do
not
pass
unregarde
by
Madam
Clement
,
who
,
while
her
own
eye
be
bedew
with
the
drop
of
sympathy
and
compassion
,
take
the
lovely
orphan
by
the
hand
,
and
lead
her
,
without
further
ceremony
,
to
her
own
coach
,
that
stand
wait
at
the
door
,
whither
they
be
follow
by
Mrs
La
Mer
,
who
be
so
much
confound
at
the
adventure
,
that
she
make
no
objection
to
the
proposal
of
the
lady
who
hand
her
lodger
into
the
carriage
;
but
retire
,
with
all
possible
dispatch
,
to
make
Fathom
acquaint
with
this
unforeseen
event
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
the
agitation
of
Monimia
,
at
this
providential
deliverance
,
be
such
as
have
<EOS>
well
nigh
destroy
her
tender
frame
:
the
blood
flush
and
forsook
her
cheek
by
turn
;
she
tremble
from
head
to
foot
,
notwithstanding
the
consolatory
assurance
of
Madam
Clement
,
and
,
without
be
able
to
utter
one
word
,
be
conduct
to
the
house
of
that
kind
benefactress
,
where
the
violence
of
her
transport
overpower
her
constitution
,
and
she
sink
down
upon
a
couch
in
a
swoon
,
from
which
she
be
not
easily
recover
.
 
<EOS>
this
affect
circumstance
augment
the
pity
,
and
interest
the
curiosity
of
Madam
Clement
,
who
conclude
there
be
something
very
extraordinary
in
the
case
of
the
stranger
,
to
produce
these
agony
;
and
grow
impatient
to
hear
the
particular
of
her
story
.
    
<EOS>
Monimia
no
sooner
retrieve
the
use
of
her
faculty
,
than
look
around
,
and
observe
with
what
humane
concern
<EOS>
her
new
hostess
be
employ
in
effect
her
recovery
"
<EOS>
be
this
(
say
she
)
a
flattering
illusion
of
the
brain
?
<EOS>
or
be
I
really
under
the
protection
of
some
beneficient
being
,
whom
heaven
hath
inspire
with
generosity
,
to
rescue
an
hapless
stranger
from
the
most
forlorn
state
of
misery
and
woe
?
"
    
<EOS>
Her
voice
be
,
at
all
time
,
ravishingly
sweet
;
and
this
exclamation
be
pronounce
with
such
pathetic
fervour
,
that
Madam
Clement
clasp
her
in
her
arm
,
and
kiss
her
with
all
the
eagerness
of
maternal
affection
,
"
<EOS>
yes
,
(
cry
she
)
<EOS>
fair
creature
,
heaven
hath
bestow
upon
me
an
heart
to
compassionate
,
and
power
,
I
hope
,
to
lighten
the
burthen
of
your
sorrow
.
"
    
<EOS>
She
then
prevail
upon
her
to
take
some
nourishment
,
and
afterwards
to
recount
the
particular
of
her
fate
;
a
task
she
perform
with
such
accuracy
and
candour
,
that
Madam
Clement
,
far
from
suspect
her
sincerity
,
see
truth
and
conviction
in
every
circumstance
of
her
tale
;
and
have
condole
her
misfortune
,
entreat
her
to
forget
them
,
or
,
at
least
,
look
upon
herself
as
one
shelter
under
the
care
and
tuition
of
a
person
,
whose
study
it
would
be
to
supply
her
want
of
natural
parent
.
 
<EOS>
this
would
have
be
an
happy
vicissitude
of
fortune
,
have
it
not
arrive
too
late
;
but
such
a
sudden
and
unlooked
for
transition
,
not
only
disorder
the
faculty
of
poor
Monimia
's
mind
,
but
also
overpower
the
organ
of
her
body
,
already
fatigue
and
enfeeble
by
the
distress
she
have
undergo
;
so
that
she
be
take
ill
of
a
fever
that
same
night
,
and
become
delirious
before
morning
,
when
a
physician
be
call
to
her
assistance
.
    
<EOS>
while
this
gentleman
be
in
the
house
,
Madam
Clement
be
visit
by
Fathom
,
who
after
have
complain
,
in
the
most
insinuating
manner
,
that
she
have
encourage
his
wife
to
abandon
her
duty
,
tell
her
a
plausible
story
of
his
first
acquaintance
with
Monimia
,
and
his
marriage
at
the
Fleet
,
which
,
he
say
,
he
be
ready
to
prove
,
by
the
evidence
of
the
clergyman
who
join
them
,
and
that
of
Mrs
la
Mer
who
be
present
at
the
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
the
good
lady
,
although
a
little
staggered
at
the
genteel
appearance
,
and
engage
address
of
this
stranger
,
could
not
prevail
upon
herself
to
believe
that
she
have
be
impose
upon
by
her
fair
lodger
,
who
,
by
this
time
,
have
give
too
convincing
a
proof
of
her
sincerity
;
nevertheless
,
in
order
to
prevent
any
dispute
that
may
be
prejudicial
to
the
health
or
recovery
of
Monimia
,
she
give
him
to
understand
,
that
she
would
not
,
at
present
,
enter
upon
the
merit
of
the
cause
,
but
only
assure
him
,
that
the
young
lady
be
actually
bereft
of
her
sense
,
and
in
imminent
danger
of
her
life
:
for
the
truth
of
which
assertion
she
would
appeal
to
his
own
observation
,
and
the
opinion
of
the
physician
,
who
be
then
employ'd
<EOS>
in
write
a
prescription
for
the
cure
of
her
disease
.
    
<EOS>
so
say
,
she
conduct
him
into
the
chamber
,
where
he
behold
the
hapless
virgin
stretch
upon
a
sick
bed
,
pant
under
the
violence
of
a
distemper
too
mighty
for
her
weakly
frame
,
her
hair
dishevel
,
and
discomposure
in
her
look
;
all
the
rose
of
her
youth
be
fade
,
yet
all
the
grace
of
her
beauty
be
not
flee
:
she
retain
that
sweetness
and
symmetry
,
which
death
itself
could
not
destroy
;
and
though
her
discourse
be
incoherent
,
her
voice
be
still
musical
,
resemble
those
feather
songster
who
warble
their
native
wood
-
note
wild
.
    
<EOS>
Fathom
,
as
upon
all
other
occasion
,
so
on
this
,
do
behave
like
an
inimitable
actor
;
he
run
to
the
bed
-
side
,
with
all
the
trepidation
of
a
distracted
lover
;
he
fall
upon
his
knee
,
and
while
the
tear
roll
down
his
cheek
,
imprint
a
thousand
kiss
on
the
soft
hand
of
Monimia
,
who
regard
him
with
a
lack
lustre
,
and
undistinguishing
eye
,
"
alas
!
<EOS>
Renaldo
,
(
say
she
)
<EOS>
we
be
bear
to
be
unhappy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Would
to
heaven
!
<EOS>
(
cry
Ferdinand
in
a
transport
of
grief
)
<EOS>
the
wretch
Renaldo
have
never
be
bear
!
<EOS>
that
be
the
villain
who
seduce
the
affection
of
this
unfortunate
woman
.
 
<EOS>
I
admit
the
traitor
into
my
friendship
and
confidence
,
relieve
him
in
his
necessity
;
and
,
like
the
ungrateful
viper
<EOS>
,
he
hath
sting
the
very
bosom
that
cherish
him
in
his
distress
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
proceed
to
inform
Madam
Clement
<EOS>
,
how
he
have
deliver
that
same
Renaldo
from
prison
,
maintain
him
afterwards
at
a
great
expence
,
and
,
at
length
,
furnish
him
with
a
sum
of
money
,
and
proper
credential
to
support
his
interest
at
the
court
of
Vienna
.
    
<EOS>
have
finish
this
detail
,
he
ask
the
physician
's
sentiment
of
his
wife
's
distemper
,
and
be
tell
,
that
her
life
be
in
extreme
jeopardy
,
beg
he
would
use
his
utmost
endeavour
in
her
behalf
,
and
even
make
him
a
tender
of
an
extraordinary
fee
;
which
be

he
also
thank
Madam
Clement
for
her
charity
and
benevolence
towards
a
stranger
,
and
take
his
leave
,
with
many
polite
profession
of
gratitude
and
esteem
.
    
<EOS>
He
have
no
sooner
quit
the
house
,
than
the
physician
,
who
be
a
humane
man
,
and
a
foreigner
,
begin
to
caution
the
lady
against
his
insinuation
,
observe
,
that
some
circumstance
of
the
story
concern
Renaldo
,
be
,
to
his
particular
knowledge
,
contrary
to
truth
:
for
that
he
himself
have
be
apply
to
for
letter
of
recommendation
,
in
behalf
of
Count
Melvil
,
by
a
Jew
merchant
of
his
acquaintance
,
who
have
supply
the
young
gentleman
with
money
sufficient
for
his
occasion
,
in
consequence
of
a
minute
inquiry
he
have
make
into
the
character
of
Renaldo
,
who
be
,
by
all
report
,
a
youth
of
strict
honour
and
untainted
moral
.
    
<EOS>
Madam
Clement
,
thus
caution
,
enter
into
deliberation
with
her
own
thought
,
and
compare
the
particular
of
this
account
with
those
of
Monimia
's
own
story
<EOS>
,
she
conclude
,
that
Fathom
be
the
very
traitor
he
himself
have
describe
;
and
that
he
have
,
by
abuse
the
confidence
of
both
,
effect
a
fatal
breach
between
two
innocent
and
deserve
lover
.
 
<EOS>
She
accordingly
look
upon
him
with
horror
and
detestation
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
resolve
to
treat
him
with
civility
in
the
mean
time
,
that
the
poor
young
lady
may
not
be
disturb
in
her
last
moment
;
for
she
have
now
lose
all
hope
of
her
recovery
.
 
<EOS>
yet
the
fever
abate
,
and
in
two
day
she
retrieve
the
use
of
her
reason
:
though
the
distemper
have
affect
her
lung
,
and
she
be
in
all
appearance
doom
to
linger
a
few
week
longer
in
a
consumption
.
    
<EOS>
Fathom
be
punctual
in
his
visitation
,
tho
'
never
admit
into
her
presence
after
the
delirium
vanish
;
and
he
have
the
opportunity
of
see
her
convey
in
a
chariot
to
Kensington
Gravel
-
pit
,
a
place
which
may
be
term
the
last
stage
of
many
a
mortal
peregrination
.
    
<EOS>
He
now
implicitly
believe
,
that
death
would
in
a
few
day
baffle
all
his
design
upon
the
unfortunate
Monimia
;
and
foreseeing
,
that
,
as
he
have
own
himself
her
husband
,
he
may
be
oblige
to
defray
the
expence
incur
by
her
sickness
and
burial
,
he
very
prudently
intermit
in
his
visit
,
and
have
recourse
to
the
intelligence
of
his
auxiliary
.
    
<EOS>
as
for
Monimia
,
she
approach
the
goal
of
life
;
not
simply
with
resignation
,
but
with
rapture
:
she
enjoy
,
in
tranquillity
,
the
conversation
of
her
kind
benefactress
,
who
never
stir
from
her
apartment
;
she
be
bless
with
the
spiritual
consolation
of
a
worthy
clergyman
,
who
remove
all
her
religious
scruple
;
and
she
congratulate
herself
on
the
near
prospect
of
that
land
of
peace
where
sorrow
be
not
know
.
    
<EOS>
at
length
Mrs
la
Mer
give
notice
to
our
adventurer
of
this
amiable
young
lady
's
decease
,
and
the
time
fix
for
the
interment
:
upon
which
these
two
virtuous
associate
take
possession
of
a
place
,
from
whence
they
could
,
unperceived
,
behold
the
funeral
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
have
a
hard
heart
,
who
,
without
an
emotion
of
pity
,
can
see
the
last
office
perform
to
a
young
creature
cut
off
in
the
flower
of
youth
and
beauty
,
even
though
he
know
not
her
name
,
and
be
an
utter
stranger
to
her
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
how
callous
then
must
the
soul
of
that
wretch
have
be
,
who
,
without
a
symptom
of
remorse
or
concern
,
see
the
sable
hearse
adorn
with
white
plume
,
as
emblem
of
Monimia
's
purity
,
pass
before
him
,
while
her
incomparable
merit
stand
full
in
his
remembrance
,
and
he
know
himself
the
wicked
cause
of
her
untimely
fate
!
    
<EOS>
perfidious
wretch
!
<EOS>
thy
crime
turn
out
so
attrocious
,
that
I
half
repent
me
of
have
undertake
to
record
thy
memoir
:
yet
such
monster
ought
to
be
exhibit
to
public
view
,
that
mankind
may
be
upon
their
guard
against
imposture
;
that
the
world
may
see
how
fraud
be
apt
to
overshoot
itself
:
and
that
,
as
virtue
,
though
it
may
suffer
for
a
while
,
will
triumph
in
the
end
;
so
iniquity
,
though
it
may
prosper
for
a
season
,
will
at
last
be
overtake
by
that
punishment
and
disgrace
which
be
its
due
.
     
<EOS>
Fathom
shift
the
scene
,
and
appear
in
a
new
character
.
   
<EOS>
Fathom
's
expectation
,
with
respect
to
the
fair
orphan
,
have
thus
prove
abortive
,
he
lose
no
time
in
bewail
his
miscarriage
,
but
have
immediate
recourse
to
other
mean
of
improve
his
small
fortune
,
which
,
at
this
period
,
amount
to
near
two
hundred
pound
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
inclination
he
have
to
resume
the
character
he
have
formerly
bear
in
the
polite
world
<EOS>
,
he
durst
not
venture
to
launch
out
again
into
the
expence
necessary
to
maintain
that
station
,
because
his
former
resource
be
now
stopt
,
and
all
the
people
of
fashion
,
by
this
time
,
convince
of
his
be
a
needy
adventurer
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
resolve
to
sound
the
sentiment
of
his
old
friend
at
a
distance
,
and
judge
,
from
the
reception
he
should
meet
with
<EOS>
,
how
far
he
may
presume
upon
their
countenance
and
favour
:
<EOS>
for
he
rightly
suppose
,
that
,
if
he
could
in
any
shape
contribute
to
their
interest
or
amusement
,
they
would
easily
forgive
his
former
pretension
to
quality
,
arrogant
as
they
be
,
and
still
entertain
him
on
the
footing
of
a
necessary
acquaintance
.
    
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
he
one
day
present
himself
at
court
in
a
very
gay
suit
of
cloath
,
and
bow
,
at
a
distance
,
to
many
of
his
old
fashionable
friend
of
both
sex
,
not
one
of
whom
favour
him
with
any
other
notice
,
than
that
of
a
quarter
<EOS>
curt'sy
,
or
slight
inclination
of
the
head
:
for
,
by
this
time
,
the
few
that
remember
him
know
from
what
retirement
he
now
emerge
,
and
avoid
him
accordingly
as
the
jail
infection
:
but
the
great
part
of
those
who
have
cultivate
him
in
the
zenith
of
his
fortune
,
be
now
utter
stranger
to
his
person
,
which
they
have
actually
forget
,
amidst
the
succession
of
novelty
that
surround
them
;
or
,
if
they
do
recollect
his
name
,
it
be
remember
as
an
old
fashion
which
have
be
many
month
out
of
date
.
    
<EOS>
notwithstanding
these
mortifying
discouragement
,
our
hero
,
that
same
evening
,
effect
a
lodgement
in
a
certain
gaming
house
not
far
from
St
James
's
;
and
,
as
he
play
pretty
high
,
and
make
a
parade
of
his
ready
money
,
he
be
soon
recognize
by
diver
person
of
consequence
,
who
cordially
welcome
him
to
England
,
on
pretence
of
believe
he
have
be
abroad
,
and
with
great
complacency
,
repeat
their
former
profession
of
friendship
.
    
<EOS>
Tho
'
<EOS>
this
be
a
certain
way
of
retain
the
favour
of
those
worthy
,
while
his
finance
continue
to
flourish
,
and
his
payment
be
prompt
,
he
know
the
weakness
of
his
fund
too
well
,
to
think
they
could
bear
the
vicissitude
of
play
;
and
the
remembrance
of
the
two
british
Knights
who
have
spoil
him
at
Paris
,
hang
over
his
imagination
with
the
most
frightful
presage
:
besides
,
he
perceive
that
gaming
be
now
manage
in
such
a
manner
,
as
render
skill
and
dexterity
of
no
advantage
:
for
the
spirit
of
play
have
overspread
the
land
,
like
a
pestilence
,
rage
to
such
a
degree
of
madness
and
desperation
,
that
the
unhappy
people
who
be
infect
,
lay
aside
all
thought
of
amusement
,
oeconomy
or
caution
,
and
risqed
their
fortune
upon
issue
equally
extravagant
,
childish
,
and
absurd
.
    
<EOS>
the
whole
mystery
of
the
art
be
reduce
to
the
simple
exercise
of
toss
up
a
guinea
,
and
the
lust
of
lay
wager
,
which
they
indulge
to
a
surprising
pitch
of
ridiculous
intemperance
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
corner
of
the
room
may
be
hear
a
pair
of
lordling
run
their
grandmother
against
each
other
,
that
is
,
bet
sum
on
the
long
liver
;
in
another
,
the
success
of
the
wager
depend
upon
the
sex
of
the
landlady
's
next
child
;
and
one
of
the
waiter
happen
to
drop
down
in
an
apoplectic
fit
,
a
certain
noble
peer
exclaim
,
"
dead
for
a
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
challenge
be
immediately
accept
;
and
when
the
master
of
the
house
send
for
a
surgeon
to
attempt
the
cure
,
the
nobleman
who
set
the
price
upon
the
patient
's
head
,
insist
upon
his
be
leave
to
the
effort
of
nature
alone
,
otherwise
the
wager
should
be
void
;
nay
,
when
the
landlord
harp
upon
the
loss
he
should
sustain
by
the
death
of
a
trusty
servant
,
his
lordship
obviate
the
objection
,
by
desire
that
the
fellow
may
be
charge
in
the
bill
    
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
rage
of
gaming
seem
to
have
devour
all
their
other
faculty
,
and
to
have
equal
the
rash
enthusiasm
of
the
inhabitant
of
Malacca
in
the
East
-
Indies
,
who
be
so
possessed
with
that
pernicious
spirit
,
that
they
sacrifice
to
it
not
only
their
fortune
,
but
also
their
wife
and
child
;
and
then
let
their
hair
down
upon
their
shoulder
,
in
imitation
of
the
ancient
Lacedemonians
when
they
devote
themselves
to
death
,
those
wretch
unsheath
their
dagger
and
murder
every
live
creature
in
their
way
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
,
however
,
they
differ
from
the
gamester
of
our
country
,
who
never
find
their
sense
,
until
they
have
lose
their
fortune
,
and
beggar
their
family
;
whereas
the
Malayse
never
run
a
muck
,
but
in
consequence
of
misery
and
despair
.
    
<EOS>
such
be
the
amusement
,
or
rather
,
<EOS>
such
be
the
continual
employment
of
those
hopeful
youth
who
be
destine
by
birth
to
be
the
judge
of
our
property
,
and
pillar
of
our
constitution
;
such
be
the
heir
and
representative
of
those
patriot
who
plan
,
and
those
hero
who
maintain
the
law
and
freedom
of
their
country
;
who
be
the
patron
of
merit
,
the
father
of
the
poor
,
the
terror
of
vice
and
immorality
,
and
,
at
once
,
the
ornament
and
support
of
an
happy
nation
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
consider
all
these
circumstance
with
his
wonted
sagacity
,
and
see
upon
what
precarious
footing
he
must
stand
,
should
he
rank
himself
with
such
society
,
he
wisely
come
to
the
resolution
of
descend
one
step
in
the
degree
of
life
,
and
of
take
upon
him
the
title
of
physician
,
under
which
he
do
not
despair
of
insinuate
himself
into
the
pocket
of
his
patient
,
and
into
the
secret
of
private
family
,
so
as
to
acquire
a
comfortable
share
of
practice
,
or
captivate
the
heart
of
some
heiress
,
or
rich
widow
,
whose
fortune
would
,
at
once
,
render
him
independent
and
happy
.
    
<EOS>
after
this
determination
,
his
next
care
be
,
to
concert
measure
for
his
first
appearance
in
this
new
character
;
<EOS>
well
know
,
that
the
success
of
a
physician
,
in
a
great
measure
,
depend
upon
the
external
equipage
in
which
he
first
declare
himself
an
adept
in
the
healing
art
.
 
<EOS>
He
first
of
all
procure
a
few
book
on
the
subject
of
medicine
,
which
he
study
with
great
attention
,
during
the
remain
part
of
the
winter
and
spring
,
and
repair
to
Tunbridge
with
the
first
of
the
season
,
where
he
appear
in
the
uniform
of
Aesculapius
,
namely
,
a
plain
suit
full
trimm'd
,
with
a
voluminous
tye
-
perriwig
;
believe
that
,
in
this
place
,
he
may
glide
,
as
it
be
,
imperceptibly
,
into
the
function
of
his
new
employment
,
and
gradually
accustom
himself
to
the
method
and
form
of
prescription
.
    
<EOS>
a
man
so
well
known
in
the
gay
world
could
not
be
suppose
to
effect
such
a
transformation
,
without
be
observe
;
and
therefore
,
in
order
to
anticipate
the
censure
and
ridicule
of
those
who
may
be
tempt
to
make
themselves
merry
at
his
expence
,
he
,
on
his
arrival
at
the
well
,
repair
to
the
shop
of
an
apothecary
,
and
,
call
for
pen
,
ink
and
paper
,
write
a
prescription
,
which
he
desire
may
be
immediately
make
up
.
    
<EOS>
while
this
be
do
by
the
servant
,
he
be
invite
into
a
parlour
by
the
master
,
with
whom
he
enter
into
conversation
,
touch
the
property
of
the
Tunbridge
-
water
,
which
seem
to
have
be
his
particular
study
:
and
indeed
he
have
peruse
Rouzee
's
treatise
on
that
subject
,
with
indefatigable
assiduity
.
 
<EOS>
from
this
theme
,
he
make
digression
into
other
part
of
medicine
,
upon
which
he
speak
with
such
plausible
elocution
,
that
the
apothecary
,
whose
knowledge
in
that
art
be
not
very
profound
,
look
upon
him
as
a
physician
of
great
learning
and
experience
,
and
hint
a
desire
of
know
his
name
and
situation
.
    
<EOS>
Fathom
accordingly
give
him
to
understand
,
that
he
have
study
physic
,
and
have
take
his
degree
at
Padua
,
rather
for
his
amusement
,
than
with
any
view
of
exercise
medicine
,
as
he
then
could
not
possibly
foresee
the
misfortune
which
have
since
happen
to
his
family
,
and
by
which
he
be
now
compel
to
have
recourse
to
a
profession
that
be
very
much
beneath
the
expectation
of
his
birth
.
 
<EOS>
yet
he
bear
his
disappointment
with
resignation
,
and
even
good
humour
,
and
bless
his
star
for
have
incline
him
to
the
study
of
any
branch
of
knowledge
by
which
he
may
be
enable
to
laugh
at
the
vicissitudes
of
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
observe
,
that
he
have
practise
with
some
applause
at
the
hot
-
well
,
near
Bristol
,
before
he
think
he
should
be
ever
reduce
to
the
necessity
of
take
a
fee
:
and
that
,
in
all
probability
,
his
metamorphosis
,
when
know
,
would
furnish
matter
of
surprise
and
merriment
to
some
of
his
old
acquaintance
.
    
<EOS>
the
apothecary
be
equally
strike
with
his
polite
address
,
and
please
with
his
agreeable
discourse
:
he
console
him
for
the
misfortune
of
his
family
,
by
assure
him
,
that
,
in
England
,
nothing
could
be
more
honourable
,
or
indeed
profitable
,
than
the
character
of
a
physician
,
provide
he
could
once
wriggle
himself
into
practice
;
and
insinuate
,
that
,
although
he
be
restrict
by
certain
engagement
with
other
person
of
the
faculty
,
he
should
be
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
shew
his
regard
for
Doctor
Fathom
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
very
effectual
method
which
our
hero
take
to
intimate
his
new
character
to
the
public
.
 
<EOS>
by
the
industry
and
communicative
disposition
of
the
apothecary
,
it
be
circulate
in
half
a
day
through
every
family
in
the
place
;
and
next
morning
,
when
Ferdinand
appear
,
the
company
forthwith
assemble
in
separate
group
,
and
from
each
knot
he
hear
his
name
reverberate
in
a
whisper
.
    
<EOS>
have
thus
announce
himself
to
all
whom
it
may
concern
,
and
allow
the
lady
two
day
to
discuss
the
merit
of
his
transfiguration
,
together
with
the
novelty
of
the
case
,
he
venture
to
salute
,
at
a
distance
,
a
lady
and
her
daughter
,
who
have
be
his
patient
at
the
hot
-
well
;
and
although
they
honour
his
bow
with
the
return
of
a
slight
curtsy
,
they
give
him
not
the
least
encouragement
to
make
a
near
approach
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
rebuff
,
he
conclude
,
that
,
should
the
health
of
either
come
in
question
,
they
would
renew
their
application
to
his
skill
,
and
what
be
refuse
by
their
pride
,
would
be
grant
by
their
apprehension
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
however
,
he
happen
to
be
mistake
in
his
conjecture
.
    
<EOS>
the
young
lady
be
seize
with
a
violent
head
-
ach
and
palpitation
,
her
mother
desire
the
apothecary
to
recommend
a
physician
;
and
the
person
,
with
whom
he
be
contract
,
be
at
that
time
absent
,
he
propose
doctor
Fathom
as
a
man
of
great
ability
and
discretion
:
but
the
good
lady
reject
the
proposal
with
disdain
,
because
she
have
formerly
know
him
in
the
character
of
a
Count
;
though
that
very
character
be
the
chief
reason
that
have
then
induce
her
to
crave
his
advice
.
    
<EOS>
Such
be
the
caprice
of
the
world
in
general
,
<EOS>
that
whatever
bear
the
face
of
novelty
captivate
,
or
rather
bewitch
the
imagination
,
and
confound
the
idea
of
reason
and
common
sense
.
 
<EOS>
if
,
for
example
,
a
scullion
from
the
clinking
of
pewter
should
conceive
a
taste
for
the
clinking
of
rhime
,
and
make
shift
to
bring
together
twenty
syllable
,
so
as
that
the
tenth
and
last
shall
have
the
like
-
end
:
the
composition
be
immediately
extoll
as
a
miracle
;
and
what
appeal
to
the
admiration
,
be
not
the
wit
,
the
elegance
or
poetry
of
the
work
,
but
the
uncultivated
talent
,
and
humble
station
of
the
author
.
 
<EOS>
a
reader
do
not
exclaim
,
"
what
a
delicate
sentiment
!
<EOS>
what
a
beautiful
simile
!
<EOS>
what
easy
and
musical
versification
!
"
<EOS>
but
cry
in
rapture
,
"
Heavens
!
<EOS>
what
a
prodigy
!
<EOS>
a
poet
from
the
scullery
!
<EOS>
a
muse
in
livery
!
<EOS>
or
,
Apollo
with
a
trowel
!
"
   
<EOS>
the
public
be
astonish
into
liberality
 
<EOS>
the
scullion
eat
from
those
trencher
he
scour
before
 
the
footman
be
admit
into
the
coach
,
behind
which
he
be
will
not
to
stand
;
and
the
bricklayer
,
instead
of
plaistere
wall
,
bedaub
his
illustrious
part'ner
with
the
mortar
of
his
praise
.
    
<EOS>
thus
,
lift
into
an
high
sphere
,
their
talent
receive
cultivation
;
they
become
professed
bard
;
and
tho
'
their
subsequent
work
bear
evident
mark
of
improvement
,
they
be
neglect
among
the
rest
of
their
brother
;
because
that
novelty
,
which
recommend
them
in
the
beginning
,
no
longer
remain
.
    
<EOS>
so
it
fare
with
our
adventurer
in
his
new
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
so
extraordinary
in
a
nobleman
's
understanding
medicine
;
and
so
uncommon
in
a
physician
's
prescribing
gratis
,
that
the
curiosity
and
admiration
of
the
company
at
Bristol
be
engage
,
and
they
follow
his
advice
,
as
the
direction
of
some
supernatural
intelligence
:
<EOS>
but
,
now
that
he
profess
himself
one
of
the
faculty
,
and
may
be
suppose
to
have
refresh
his
memory
,
and
reinforce
his
knowledge
for
the
occasion
,
he
be
as
much
overlook
as
any
other
physician
unsupporte
by
interest
or
cabal
;
or
,
at
least
,
the
notice
he
attract
be
not
at
all
to
the
advantage
of
his
character
,
because
it
wholly
regard
the
decline
of
his
fortune
,
which
be
a
never
-
fail
fund
of
disgrace
.
    
<EOS>
these
mortification
do
not
overcome
the
patience
and
perseverance
of
Fathom
,
who
foresaw
that
the
soothing
hand
of
time
would
cast
a
veil
of
oblivion
over
those
scene
which
be
remember
to
his
prejudice
;
and
that
in
the
mean
time
,
though
he
be
exclude
from
the
private
party
of
the
fair
sex
,
in
which
his
main
hope
of
success
be
place
,
he
should
be
able
to
insinuate
himself
into
some
degree
of
favour
and
practice
among
the
male
patient
;
and
some
lucky
cure
,
properly
display
,
may
be
the
mean
of
propagate
his
fame
,
and
banish
that
reserve
which
at
present
interfere
with
his
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
accordingly
,
it
be
not
long
before
he
find
mean
to
break
that
spell
of
universal
prejudice
that
hedge
him
in
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
ordinary
which
he
frequent
,
his
polite
carriage
,
facetious
remark
,
and
agreeable
story
,
soon
conciliate
the
regard
of
his
fellow
guest
,
among
whom
he
sometimes
rally
his
own
transformation
with
singular
good
humour
and
success
:
he
be
even
witty
upon
his
want
of
employment
;
and
use
to
observe
,
that
a
physician
,
without
practice
,
have
one
comfort
to
which
his
brother
be
stranger
,
namely
,
that
the
seldomer
he
have
occasion
to
prescribe
,
the
less
he
have
upon
his
conscience
on
account
of
be
accessory
to
the
death
of
his
fellow
creature
.
    
<EOS>
nothing
so
effectually
blunt
the
shaft
of
ridicule
,
and
defeat
the
aim
of
slander
,
as
this
method
of
anticipation
.
 
<EOS>
in
spite
of
the
arrow
that
be
level
against
his
reputation
from
every
tea
-
table
at
Tunbridge
,
he
make
his
party
good
among
almost
all
the
gay
young
gentleman
that
frequent
the
place
:
far
from
avoid
his
company
,
they
begin
to
court
his
conversation
,
and
he
be
commonly
see
in
the
walk
,
surround
with
a
group
of
admirer
.
    
<EOS>
have
thus
pave
the
way
for
a
total
removal
of
the
invidious
prepossession
that
obstruct
his
view
,
he
,
one
night
,
while
every
person
be
lull
in
the
arm
of
repose
,
and
universal
silence
prevail
,
tune
his
violin
,
and
begin
to
play
some
masterly
air
,
in
a
tone
so
uncommonly
expressive
,
and
with
such
ravish
dexterity
of
execution
,
that
a
certain
lady
who
lodge
in
the
same
house
,
be
wake
by
the
music
,
and
ignorant
of
the
source
from
which
it
flow
,
listen
with
rapture
,
as
to
the
harp
of
an
angel
,
and
wrap
herself
in
a
loose
gown
,
rise
and
open
her
chamber
-
door
,
in
order
to
discover
in
what
apartment
the
musician
reside
.
 
<EOS>
She
no
sooner
enter
the
passage
,
than
she
find
her
fellow
-
lodger
already
assemble
on
the
same
occasion
;
and
there
they
remain
during
the
good
part
of
the
night
,
transport
by
the
harmony
which
our
hero
produce
.
    
<EOS>
Doctor
Fathom
be
immediately
know
to
be
the
author
of
this
entertainment
;
and
thus
retrieve
the
benefit
of
that
admiration
which
he
have
forfeit
by
appear
in
the
shape
of
a
physician
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
as
people
have
formerly
wonder
to
see
a
Count
skilled
in
medicine
;
they
be
now
amazed
to
find
a
physician
such
a
master
in
music
.
    
<EOS>
the
good
effect
of
this
stratagem
be
almost
instantaneous
.
 
<EOS>
His
performance
become
the
topic
of
discourse
among
all
the
fashionable
company
:
his
male
friend
compliment
him
from
the
information
of
the
other
sex
;
and
that
lady
whom
he
have
regale
,
instead
of
that
shyness
and
disdain
with
which
she
use
to
receive
his
salutation
,
at
their
very
next
meeting
in
the
thorough
-
fare
,
return
his
bow
with
mark
of
profound
respect
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
at
midnight
,
she
,
with
the
rest
,
take
post
in
the
same
place
where
they
have
be
station
before
;
and
by
frequent
tittering
,
and
repeat
whisper
,
give
intimation
to
Fathom
,
that
they
would
be
glad
of
a
second
serenade
.
    
<EOS>
but
he
be
too
well
acquaint
with
the
human
passion
to
indulge
this
their
desire
:
it
be
his
interest
to
inflame
their
impatience
,
rather
than
to
gratify
their
expectation
:
and
therefore
he
tantalize
them
for
some
hour
,
by
tune
his
violin
,
and
play
some
flourish
,
which
,
however
,
produce
nothing
to
fulfill
their
wish
.
    
<EOS>
at
the
ordinary
,
he
be
accost
by
a
gentleman
a
lodger
in
the
same
house
,
who
assure
him
,
that
the
lady
would
take
it
as
a
great
favour
,
if
he
would
let
them
know
when
he
intend
to
amuse
himself
again
with
his
instrument
,
that
they
may
not
,
by
fall
asleep
before
-
hand
,
deprive
themselves
of
the
pleasure
of
hear
his
music
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
message
he
reply
with
an
air
of
consequence
and
reserve
,
that
,
though
music
be
not
the
art
he
profess
,
he
should
be
always
complaisant
enough
to
entertain
the
lady
to
the
utmost
of
his
power
,
when
their
command
be
signify
to
him
in
a
manner
suit
to
his
character
;
but
that
he
would
never
put
himself
on
the
footing
of
an
itinerant
harper
,
whose
music
be
tolerate
thro
'
the
medium
of
a
board
partition
.
 
<EOS>
the
gentleman
have
report
this
answer
to
his
constituent
,
they
empower
him
to
invite
doctor
Fathom
to
breakfast
,
and
he
be
next
morning
introduce
with
the
usual
ceremony
,
and
treat
with
uncommon
regard
by
all
the
female
of
the
house
,
assemble
for
his
reception
.
    
<EOS>
have
thus
break
the
ice
of
their
aversion
,
in
one
part
,
so
as
that
the
beam
of
his
personal
accomplishment
have
room
to
operate
,
he
soon
effect
a
general
thaw
in
his
favour
,
and
find
himself
grow
once
more
into
request
among
the
most
amiable
part
of
the
creation
.
 
<EOS>
His
company
be
covet
,
and
his
taste
consult
in
their
ball
,
concert
,
and
private
assembly
;
and
he
recompence
the
regard
they
pay
to
him
,
with
an
incessant
exertion
of
his
agreeable
talent
,
politeness
,
and
good
humour
.
     
<EOS>
Triumphs
over
a
medical
rival
.
   
<EOS>
yet
,
in
the
midst
of
all
this
attention
,
his
medical
capacity
seem
to
be
quite
forget
.
 
<EOS>
They
respect
his
good
breeding
,
be
charm
with
his
voice
,
and
admire
the
fine
touch
of
his
hand
upon
the
violin
;
but
,
in
cultivate
the
fidler
they
utterly
neglect
the
physician
;
and
in
vain
do
he
attempt
to
divide
their
regard
,
by
take
all
opportunity
to
turn
the
conversation
into
a
more
interesting
channel
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
to
little
purpose
he
endeavour
to
arouse
the
wonder
of
his
audience
with
frequent
description
of
portentuous
malady
and
amazing
cure
he
have
see
and
perform
in
the
course
of
his
study
and
practice
abroad
:
and
to
no
effect
do
he
publickly
busy
himself
in
make
experiment
on
the
mineral
water
,
in
which
he
pretend
to
have
make
several
new
and
important
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
these
effort
do
not
make
a
lasting
impression
upon
the
mind
of
the
company
;
because
they
see
nothing
surprizing
in
a
physician
's
be
acquaint
with
all
the
mystery
of
his
art
;
and
,
as
their
custom
be
already
bespeak
for
other
of
the
profession
,
whom
it
be
their
interest
to
employ
,
our
adventurer
may
have
starve
amidst
the
caress
of
his
acquaintance
,
have
not
he
derive
considerable
advantage
from
a
lucky
accident
in
the
course
of
his
expectancy
.
    
<EOS>
a
gentlewoman
's
daughter
,
of
a
weakly
constitution
,
by
drink
the
water
,
have
so
far
reovere
her
health
and
complexion
,
as
to
allure
the
affection
of
a
young
squire
in
the
neighbourhood
,
who
amuse
her
for
some
time
with
his
address
,
until
his
heart
be
seduce
by
the
charm
of
another
young
lady
lately
arrive
at
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
the
forsaken
nymph
,
shock
at
this
disgrace
and
mortification
,
relapse
into
her
former
languishing
disorder
,
and
be
by
her
mother
put
under
the
management
and
prescription
of
a
physician
,
who
have
be
an
industrious
enemy
of
Fathom
,
from
his
first
appearance
at
Tunbridge
.
 
<EOS>
the
patient
,
tho
'
violently
chagrin
at
the
levity
of
her
quondam
admirer
,
be
not
altogether
without
hope
,
that
the
very
same
inconstancy
which
have
prompt
him
to
leave
her
,
may
in
time
induce
him
to
return
,
after
the
novelty
of
his
new
passion
should
be
wear
off
;
and
this
hope
serve
to
support
her
under
the
sorrow
and
disgrace
of
her
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
the
squire
and
his
new
mistress
disappear
,
and
some
busy
body
be
officious
enough
to
communicate
this
piece
of
news
to
the
forlorn
shepherdess
,
with
this
additional
circumstance
,
that
they
be
go
to
a
neighbouring
parish
,
to
be
join
in
the
band
of
wedlock
.
    
<EOS>
these
fatal
tiding
be
no
sooner
impart
to
the
abandon
Phillis
,
than
she
be
seize
with
an
hysteric
fit
;
and
,
what
render
the
accident
more
unfortunate
,
her
physician
have
be
call
to
the
country
,
and
be
not
expect
at
Tunbridge
till
next
day
.
    
<EOS>
the
apothecary
be
immediately
summon
;
and
,
be
either
puzzle
by
the
symptom
,
or
afraid
of
encroach
upon
the
province
of
his
superior
,
advise
the
old
lady
to
send
for
doctor
Fathom
without
delay
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
no
other
objection
to
this
expedient
,
but
<EOS>
the
enmity
which
she
know
subsist
between
the
two
leech
:
yet
hear
that
her
own
doctor
would
not
consult
with
Fathom
upon
his
return
,
but
,
perhaps
,
renounce
the
patient
,
by
which
mean
her
daughter
's
health
may
be
endanger
,
she
would
not
sollicit
our
hero
's
assistance
,
until
the
young
lady
have
remain
seven
hour
speechless
and
insensible
;
when
her
fear
prevail
over
every
other
consideration
,
she
implore
the
advice
of
our
adventurer
,
who
have
make
the
necessary
interrogation
,
and
feel
the
patient
's
pulse
,
which
be
regular
and
distinct
,
find
reason
to
conclude
,
that
the
fit
would
not
last
much
longer
;
and
after
have
observe
,
that
she
be
in
a
very
dangerous
way
,
prescribe
some
medicine
for
external
application
;
and
,
to
enhance
their
opinion
of
his
diligence
and
humanity
,
resolve
to
stay
in
the
room
,
and
observe
their
effect
.
    
<EOS>
His
judgment
do
not
fail
him
on
this
occasion
.
    
<EOS>
in
less
than
half
an
hour
after
his
embrocation
have
be
apply

reputation
,
so
as
to
take
root
in
London
,
which
be
the
only
soil
in
which
he
could
propose
to
rise
to
any
degree
of
prosperity
and
independance
;
and
this
reflection
be
ground
upon
a
maxim
which
universally
prevail
among
the
english
people
,
namely
,
to
overlook
and
wholly
neglect
on
their
return
to
the
metropolis
<EOS>
,
all
the
connexion
they
may
have
chance
to
acquire
during
their
residence
at
any
of
the
medical
well
;
and
this
social
disposition
be
so
scrupulously
maintain
,
that
two
person
,
who
live
in
the
most
intimate
correspondence
at
Bath
or
Tunbridge
,
shall
,
in
four
and
twenty
hour
,
so
totally
forget
their
friendship
,
as
to
meet
in
St
James
's
park
,
without
betray
the
least
token
of
recognition
;
so
that
one
would
imagine
those
mineral
water
be
so
many
stream
issue
from
the
river
Lethe
,
so
fame
of
old
,
for
wash
away
all
trace
of
memory
and
recollection
.
    
<EOS>
Aware
of
this
oblivious
principle
,
doctor
Fathom
collect
all
his
qualification
,
in
order
to
make
such
an
impression
upon
the
heart
of
Miss
Biddy
,
as
would
resist
all
her
endeavour
to
shake
him
from
her
remembrance
:
and
his
effort
succeed
so
well
,
that
"
squire
Stub
's
advance
to
a
reconciliation
,
be
treat
with
manifest
indifference
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
probability
,
our
hero
would
have
make
a
very
advantageous
campaign
,
have
not
his
good
fortune
be
retard
by
an
obstruction
,
which
(
as
he
do
not
perceive
it
)
he
could
not
possibly
surmount
:
<EOS>
in
display
his
accomplishment
to
captivate
the
daughter
,
he
have
unwittingly
make
an
absolute
conquest
of
the
mother
,
who
superintend
the
conduct
of
Miss
Biddy
,
with
such
jealous
vigilance
,
that
he
could
find
no
opportunity
of
profit
by
the
progress
he
have
make
in
her
heart
;
for
the
careful
matron
would
never
lose
sight
of
her
,
no
,
not
for
one
moment
.
    
<EOS>
have
the
old
lady
give
the
least
intimation
to
our
adventurer
,
of
the
sentiment
she
entertain
in
his
behalf
,
his
complaisance
be
of
such
a
pliable
texture
,
that
he
would
have
quit
his
other
pursuit
,
and
make
her
the
sole
object
of
his
attention
:
but
she
either
depend
upon
the
effect
of
his
own
good
taste
and
discernment
,
or
be
too
proud
to
disclose
a
passion
which
he
have
hitherto
overlook
.
     
<EOS>
Repairs
to
the
Metropolis
,
and
enrol
himself
among
the
son
of
Paean
.
   
<EOS>
before
this
Affair
could
be
bring
to
a
proper
explanation
,
the
season
be
almost
end
,
the
lady
depart
from
Tunbridge
,
and
in
a
little
time
doctor
Fathom
follow
them
to
London
,
have
previously
obtain
permission
to
visit
them
in
that
motropolis
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
sollicite
the
same
favour
of
some
other
family
,
in
which
he
hope
to
take
root
,
though
he
know
they
be
pre
-
engaged
to
different
physician
;
and
resolve
to
make
his
first
medical
appearance
in
London
,
with
some
eclat
,
he
not
only
purchase
an
old
chariot
which
be
new
paint
for
the
purpose
,
but
likewise
hire
a
footman
,
whom
he
cloathe
in
laced
livery
,
in
order
to
distinguish
himself
from
the
common
run
of
his
brother
.
    
<EOS>
this
equipage
,
though
much
more
expensive
than
his
finance
could
bear
,
he
find
absolutely
necessary
,
to
give
him
a
chance
for
employment
;
as
every
shabby
retainer
to
physic
,
in
this
capital
,
have
provide
himself
with
a
vehicle
,
which
be
altogether
use
by
way
of
a
travel
sign
post
,
to
draw
in
customer
;
so
that
a
walk
physician
be
consider
as
an
obscure
pedlar
,
trudge
from
street
to
street
,
with
his
pack
of
knowledge
on
his
shoulder
,
and
sell
his
remnant
of
advice
by
retail
.
 
<EOS>
a
chariot
be
not
now
set
up
for
the
convenience
of
a
man
sink
under
the
fatigue
of
extensive
practice
,
but
as
a
piece
of
furniture
every
way
as
necessary
as
a
large
periwig
with
three
tail
:
and
a
physician
,
let
his
merit
,
in
other
respect
,
be
never
so
conspicuous
,
can
no
more
expect
to
become
considerable
in
business
,
without
the
assistance
of
this
implement
,
than
he
can
hope
to
live
without
food
,
or
breathe
without
a
windpipe
.
    
<EOS>
this
requisite
be
so
well
understand
,
that
,
exclusive
of
those
who
profess
themselves
doctor
,
every
raw
surgeon
,
every
idle
apothecary
,
who
can
make
interest
with
some
foolhardy
coachmaker
,
may
be
see
dance
the
hay
in
all
place
of
public
resort
,
and
grin
to
one
another
from
their
respective
carriage
.
 
<EOS>
hence
proceed
many
of
those
cruel
accident
which
be
record
in
the
daily
paper
.
 
<EOS>
an
apothecary
's
horse
take
fright
,
and
run
away
with
his
chariot
,
which
be
hear
of
no
more
:
an
eminent
surgeon
be
overturn
,
be
so
terrified
at
the
thought
of
mutilation
,
that
he
resolve
to
walk
on
foot
all
the
day
of
his
life
;
and
the
coachman
of
a
physician
of
great
practice
,
have
the
misfortune
to
be
disable
by
a
fall
from
the
box
,
his
master
can
never
find
another
to
supply
his
place
.
    
<EOS>
None
of
these
observation
escape
the
penetrate
eye
of
Fathom
,
who
,
before
he
pretend
to
seat
himself
in
his
machine
,
have
make
proper
inquiry
into
all
the
other
method
practise
,
with
a
view
to
keep
the
wheel
in
motion
.
 
<EOS>
in
his
research
,
he
find
that
the
great
world
be
wholly
engross
by
a
few
practitioner
who
have
arrive
at
the
summit
of
reputation
,
consequently
be
no
longer
oblige
to
cultivate
those
art
by
which
they
rise
;
and
that
the
rest
of
the
business
be
parcel
out
into
small
inclosure
,
occupy
by
different
groupe
of
personage
,
male
and
female
,
who
stand
in
ring
,
and
toss
the
ball
from
one
to
another
,
there
be
in
each
department
two
set
,
the
individual
of
which
relieve
one
another
occasionally
.
 
<EOS>
every
knot
be
compose
of
a
waiting
-
woman
,
nurse
,
apothecary
,
surgeon
and
physician
,
and
,
sometimes
,
a
midwife
be
admit
into
the
partie
;
and
in
this
manner
the
farce
be
commonly
perform
.
    
<EOS>
a
fine
lady
,
fatigue
with
idleness
,
complain
of
the
vapour
,
be
deprive
of
her
rest
,
tho
'
not
so
sick
as
to
have
recourse
to
medicine
:
<EOS>
her
favourite
maid
,
tired
with
give
her
attendance
in
the
night
,
think
proper
,
for
the
benefit
of
her
own
repose
,
to
complain
of
a
violent
headach
,
and
recommend
to
her
mistress
a
nurse
of
approve
tenderness
and
discretion
;
at
whose
house
(
in
all
likelihood
)
the
said
chamber
-
maid
hath
oft
give
the
rendezvous
to
a
male
friend
.
    
<EOS>
the
nurse
,
well
skilled
in
the
mystery
of
her
occupation
,
persuade
the
patient
,
that
her
malady
,
far
from
be
slight
or
chimerical
,
may
proceed
to
a
very
dangerous
degree
of
the
hysterical
affection
,
unless
it
be
nipt
in
the
bud
by
some
very
effectual
remedy
:
then
she
recount
a
surprising
cure
perform
by
a
certain
apothecary
,
and
appeal
to
the
testimony
of
the
wait
woman
,
who
be
the
gossip
of
his
wife
,
confirm
the
evidence
,
and
corroborate
the
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
the
apothecary
be
summon
,
find
her
ladyship
in
such
a
delicate
situation
,
that
he
decline
prescribe
,
and
advise
her
to
send
for
a
physician
without
delay
.
 
<EOS>
the
nomination
,
of
course
,
fall
to
him
,
and
the
doctor
be
call
,
declare
the
necessity
of
immediate
venaesection
,
which
be
accordingly
perform
by
the
surgeon
of
the
association
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
one
way
of
begin
the
game
:
tho
'
the
commencement
often
vary
,
and
sometimes
the
apothecary
,
and
sometimes
the
physician
open
the
scene
;
<EOS>
but
,
be
that
as
it
will
,
they
always
appear
in
a
string
,
like
a
flight
of
wild
geese
,
and
each
confederacy
maintain
a
correspondence
with
one
particular
undertaker
.
 
<EOS>
Fathom
,
upon
these
consideration
,
set
up
his
rest
in
the
first
floor
of
an
apothecary
in
the
neighbourhood
of
charing
-
cross
,
to
whom
he
be
introduce
by
a
letter
from
a
friend
at
Tunbridge
,
and
who
be
make
acquainted
with
his
ability
and
scheme
,
promise
to
let
slip
no
opportunity
of
serve
him
;
and
,
indeed
,
seem
to
espouse
his
interest
with
great
alacrity
.
    
<EOS>
He
introduce
him
to
some
of
his
patient
,
on
the
strength
of
a
gratis
visit
,
sound
forth
his
praise
among
all
the
good
woman
of
his
acquaintance
;
and
even
prevail
upon
him
to
publish
advertisement
,
importing
,
that
he
would
,
every
day
,
at
a
certain
time
and
place
,
give
his
advice
to
the
poor
for
nothing
;
hope
,
that
,
by
mean
of
some
lucky
cure
,
his
fame
may
be
extend
,
and
his
practice
grow
into
request
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
his
chariot
roll
along
through
all
the
most
frequented
street
,
during
the
whole
forenoon
,
and
,
at
the
usual
hour
,
he
never
fail
to
make
his
appearance
at
the
medical
coffee
house
,
with
all
that
solemnity
of
feature
and
address
,
by
which
the
modern
son
of
Paean
be
distinguished
;
not
but
that
he
be
often
puzzle
about
the
decision
of
his
diurnal
route
:
for
the
method
of
drive
up
one
street
,
and
down
another
,
without
halt
,
be
become
such
a
stale
expedient
,
that
the
very
prentice
use
to
stand
at
the
shop
door
,
and
ridicule
the
vain
parade
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
he
peruse
the
map
of
London
with
great
diligence
,
and
have
acquire
a
distinct
idea
of
its
topography
,
use
to
alight
at
the
end
of
long
narrow
thoroughfare
,
and
pave
court
,
where
the
chariot
be
order
to
wait
till
his
return
;
and
walk
with
great
gravity
through
the
different
turning
of
these
alley
,
regain
his
carriage
by
another
passage
,
and
resume
his
seat
with
an
air
of
vast
importance
.
 
<EOS>
with
a
view
to
protract
the
time
of
his
suppose
visit
,
he
would
,
at
one
place
,
turn
aside
to
the
wall
;
at
another
,
cheapen
an
urinal
;
at
a
third
corner
,
read
a
quack
advertisement
,
or
lounge
a
few
minute
in
some
bookseller
's
shop
;
and
,
lastly
,
glide
into
some
obscure
coffeehouse
,
and
treat
himself
with
a
dram
of
usquebaugh
.
    
<EOS>
the
other
mean
use
to
force
a
trade
,
such
as
order
himself
to
be
call
from
church
,
alarm
the
neighbourhood
with
knock
at
his
door
in
the
night
,
receive
sudden
message
in
place
of
resort
,
and
insert
his
cure
by
way
of
news
in
the
daily
paper
,
have
be
so
injudiciously
hackneye
by
every
desperate
sculler
in
physick
,
that
they
have
lose
their
effect
upon
the
publick
,
and
therefore
be
exclude
from
the
plan
of
our
adventurer
,
whose
scheme
,
for
the
present
,
be
to
exert
himself
in
win
the
favour
of
those
sage
Sybils
,
who
keep
,
as
it
be
,
the
temple
of
medicine
,
and
admit
the
young
priest
to
the
service
of
the
altar
;
but
this
he
consider
as
a
temporary
project
only
,
until
he
should
have
acquire
interest
enough
to
erect
an
hospital
,
lock
,
or
infirmary
,
by
the
voluntary
subscription
of
his
friend
;
a
scheme
which
have
succeed
to
a
miracle
,
with
many
of
the
profession
,
who
have
raise
themselves
into
notice
,
upon
the
carcase
of
the
poor
.
    
<EOS>
yet
,
even
this
branch
be
already
overstock
,
<EOS>
insomuch
that
almost
every
street
be
furnish
with
one
of
these
charitable
receptacle
,
which
,
instead
of
diminish
the
taxis
for
the
maintainance
of
the
poor
,
encourage
the
vulgar
to
be
idle
and
dissolute
,
by
open
an
asylum
to
them
,
and
their
family
,
from
the
disease
of
poverty
and
intemperance
:
for
it
remain
to
be
prove
,
that
the
parish
rate
be
decrease
,
the
bill
of
mortality
lessen
,
the
people
more
numerous
,
or
the
street
less
infest
with
beggar
,
notwithstanding
the
immense
sum
yearly
grant
by
individual
for
the
relief
of
the
indigent
.
    
<EOS>
but
,
wave
these
reflection
,
doctor
Fathom
hope
,
that
his
landlord
would
be
a
most
useful
implement
for
extend
his
influence
,
and
,
for
that
reason
,
admit
him
into
a
degree
of
partnership
,
after
be
fully
convince
,
that
he
be
not
under
article
to
any
other
physician
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
be
very
much
mistake
in
reckon
on
the
importance
of
this
new
ally
,
who
be
,
like
himself
,
a
needy
adventurer
,
settle
upon
credit
,
and
altogether
unemployed
,
except
among
the
very
refuse
of
the
people
,
whom
no
other
person
would
take
the
trouble
to
attend
:
so
that
our
hero
get
little
else
than
experience
and
trouble
,
except
a
few
guinea
,
which
he
make
shift
to
glean
among
sojourner
,
with
whom
he
become
occasionally
acquaint
,
or
young
people
,
who
have
be
unfortunate
in
their
amour
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
these
endeavour
,
he
do
not
omit
his
duty
to
the
old
gentlewoman
,
whose
daughter
he
have
cure
at
Tunbridge
;
and
be
always
receive
with
particular
complacency
,
which
,
perhaps
,
he
,
in
some
measure
,
owe
to
his
genteel
equipage
,
that
give
credit
to
every
door
before
which
it
be
see
;
yet
Miss
Biddy
be
as
inaccessible
as
ever
,
while
the
mother
become
more
and
more
warm
in
her
civility
,
till
at
length
,
after
have
prepare
him
with
some
extraordinary
compliment
,
she
give
him
to
understand
,
that
Biddy
be
no
well
than
a
giddy
-
head
girl
,
far
from
be
unexceptionable
in
her
moral
character
,
and
particularly
deficient
in
duty
and
gratitude
to
her
,
who
have
be
always
a
tender
and
indulgent
parent
;
she
be
therefore
determined
to
punish
the
young
minx
,
for
her
levity
,
and
want
of
natural
affection
,
by
alter
her
own
condition
,
could
she
find
a
worthy
and
agreeable
man
,
on
whom
she
could
bestow
her
hand
and
fortune
without
a
blush
.
    
<EOS>
the
film
be
instantly
remove
from
Fathom
's
eye
by
this
declaration
,
which
she
utter
with
such
a
significancy
of
look
,
as
thrill
to
his
soul
with
joyful
presage
,
while
he
reply
,
it
would
,
indeed
,
be
a
difficult
task
to
find
a
man
who
merit
such
happiness
and
honour
;
but
,
surely
,
some
there
be
,
who
would
task
their
faculty
to
the
uttermost
,
in
manifest
their
gratitude
,
and
desire
of
render
themselves
worthy
of
such
distinction
.
 
<EOS>
though
this
answer
be
pronounce
in
such
a
manner
,
as
give
her
to
understand
he
have
take
the
hint
,
she
would
not
cheapen
her
condescension
so
much
as
to
explain
herself
further
at
that
juncture
,
and
he
be
very
well
contented
to
woo
her
on
her
own
term
;
accordingly
he
begin
to
season
his
behaviour
with
a
spice
of
gallantry
,
when
he
have
opportunity
of
be
particular
with
this
new
inamorata
,
and
,
in
proportion
to
the
return
she
make
,
he
gradually
detach
himself
from
Miss
Biddy
,
by
intermit
,
and
,
at
last
,
discontinue
those
ardent
expression
of
love
and
admiration
,
which
he
have
make
shift
to
convey
in
private
look
and
steal
whisper
,
during
the
rancorous
inspection
of
her
mother
.
    
<EOS>
such
alteration
could
not
long
escape
the
jealous
eye
of
the
young
lady
,
no
more
than
the
cause
of
this
alienation
,
which
,
in
a
moment
,
convert
all
her
love
into
irreconcilable
hate
,
and
fill
her
whole
soul
with
the
most
eager
desire
of
vengeance
:
for
she
now
not
only
consider
him
as
a
mercenary
wretch
,
who
have
slight
her
attraction
for
the
sordid
gratification
of
avarice
,
but
also
as
an
interloper
,
who
want
to
intercept
her
fortune
,
in
the
odious
character
of
a
father
-
in
law
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
before
she
could
bring
her
aim
to
any
ripeness
of
contrivance
,
her
mother
,
have
catch
cold
at
church
,
be
seize
with
a
rheumatic
fever
,
become
delirious
in
less
than
three
day
,
and
,
notwithstanding
all
the
prescription
and
care
of
her
admirer
,
give
up
the
ghost
,
without
have
retrieve
the
use
of
her
sense
,
or
be
able
to
manifest
,
by
will
,
<EOS>
the
sentiment
she
entertain
in
favour
of
her
physician
,
who
(
as
the
reader
will
easily
perceive
)
have
more
reason
than
one
,
to
be
mortally
chagrin
at
this
event
.
    
<EOS>
Miss
Biddy
be
thus
put
in
possession
of
the
whole
inheritance
,
not
only
renounce
all
correspondence
with
doctor
Fathom
,
by
forbid
him
the
house
,
but
likewise
take
all
opportunity
of
prejudice
his
character
,
by
hinting
,
that
her
dear
mamma
have
fall
a
sacrifice
to
his
ignorance
and
presumption
.
     
<EOS>
Acquires
employment
,
in
consequence
of
a
lucky
miscarriage
.
   
<EOS>
these
ill
office
,
however
,
far
from
answer
her
purpose
,
have
a
quite
contrary
effect
:
for
,
in
consequence
of
her
invective
,
he
be
,
in
a
few
day
,
call
to
the
wife
of
a
merchant
,
who
piously
hope
,
that
his
practice
would
not
give
Miss
Biddy
the
lie
.
    
<EOS>
the
patient
have
long
linger
under
a
complication
of
distemper
,
and
be
in
no
immediate
danger
of
her
life
,
doctor
Fathom
be
in
no
hurry
to
strike
a
decisive
stroke
;
till
the
husband
grow
impatient
of
delay
,
and
so
explicite
in
his
hint
,
that
it
be
impossible
to
misapprehend
his
meaning
,
our
adventurer
resolve
to
do
something
effectual
for
his
satisfaction
,
and
prescribe
a
medicine
of
such
rough
operation
,
as
,
he
think
,
must
either
oblige
his
employer
,
or
produce
a
change
in
the
lady
's
constitution
,
that
would
make
a
noise
in
the
world
,
and
bring
a
new
accession
to
his
fame
.
    
<EOS>
proceed
upon
these
maxim
,
he
could
not
be
disappoint
:
the
remedy
play
its
part
with
such
violence
,
as
reduce
the
patient
to
extremity
,
and
the
merchant
have
actually
bespeak
an
undertaker
;
when
,
after
a
series
of
swooning
and
convulsion
,
nature
so
far
prevailed
,
as
to
expel
,
at
once
,
the
prescription
and
the
disease
;
yet
the
good
-
natured
husband
be
so
much
affect
with
the
agony
to
which
he
see
the
wife
of
his
bosom
expose
by
this
specific
,
that
,
although
the
effect
of
it
be
her
perfect
recovery
,
he
never
could
bear
the
sight
of
Fathom
for
the
future
,
nor
ever
hear
his
name
mention
,
without
give
sign
of
horror
and
indignation
;
nay
,
he
do
not
scruple
to
affirm
,
<EOS>
that
have
our
adventurer
be
endow
with
the
least
tincture
of
humanity
,
he
would
have
suffer
the
poor
woman
to
depart
in
peace
,
rather
than
restore
her
to
health
,
at
the
expence
of
such
anxiety
and
torture
.
    
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
this
extraordinary
cure
be
blazon
abroad
by
the
good
lady
,
and
her
gossip
,
with
such
exaggeration
as
rouse
the
astonishment
of
the
public
,
and
concur
with
the
report
of
his
last
miscarriage
,
to
bring
him
upon
the
carpet
,
as
the
universal
subject
of
discourse
.
 
<EOS>
when
a
physician
become
the
town
talk
,
he
generally
conclude
his
business
more
than
half
do
,
even
though
his
fame
should
wholly
turn
upon
his
mal
-
practice
;
insomuch
that
some
member
of
the
faculty
have
be
hear
to
complain
,
that
they
never
have
the
good
fortune
to
be
publickly
accuse
of
homicide
;
and
it
be
well
know
,
that
a
certain
famous
empyrick
,
of
our
day
,
never
flourish
to
any
degree
of
wealth
and
reputation
,
till
after
he
have
be
attack
in
print
,
and
fairly
convict
of
have
destroy
a
good
number
of
the
human
specie
.
 
<EOS>
Success
raise
upon
such
a
foundation
,
would
,
by
a
disciple
of
Plato
,
and
some
modern
moralist
,
be
inscribe
to
the
innate
virtue
and
generosity
of
the
human
heart
,
which
naturally
espouse
the
cause
that
need
protection
:
but
I
,
whose
notion
of
human
excellence
be
not
quite
so
sublime
,
be
apt
to
believe
it
be
owe
to
that
spirit
of
self
-
conceit
and
contradiction
,
which
be
,
at
least
,
as
universal
,
if
not
as
natural
,
as
the
moral
sense
so
warmly
contend
for
by
those
ideal
philosopher
.
    
<EOS>
the
most
infamous
wretch
often
find
his
account
in
these
principle
of
malevolence
and
self
love
:
for
wheresoever
his
character
fall
under
discussion
,
there
be
generally
some
person
present
,
who
,
either
from
an
affectation
of
singularity
,
or
envy
to
the
accuser
,
undertake
his
defence
,
and
endeavour
to
invalidate
the
article
of
his
impeachment
,
until
he
be
heat
by
altercation
,
and
hurry
into
more
effectual
measure
for
his
advantage
.
    
<EOS>
if
such
benefit
accrue
to
those
who
have
no
real
merit
to
depend
upon
;
surely
,
our
hero
could
not
but
reap
something
extraordinary
from
the
debate
to
which
he
now
give
rise
;
as
by
the
miraculous
cure
he
have
effect
,
all
his
patient
's
friend
,
all
the
enemy
of
her
husband
,
all
those
who
envy
his
other
adversary
,
be
interested
in
his
behalf
,
exclusive
of
such
admirer
as
surprize
and
curiosity
may
engage
in
his
cause
.
    
<EOS>
thus
waft
upon
the
wing
of
applause
,
his
fame
soon
diffuse
itself
into
all
the
corner
of
this
great
capital
:
<EOS>
the
news
-
paper
teem
with
his
praise
;
and
in
order
to
keep
up
the
attention
of
the
public
,
his
emissary
,
male
and
female
,
separate
into
different
coffee
house
,
company
,
and
club
,
where
they
do
not
fail
to
comment
upon
these
article
of
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
favourable
incident
be
,
of
itself
,
sufficient
to
float
the
bark
of
a
man
's
fortune
:
<EOS>
he
be
,
in
a
few
day
,
call
to
another
lady
,
labour
under
the
same
disorder
he
have
so
successfully
dispel
,
and
she
think
herself
benefit
by
his
advice
.
 
<EOS>
His
acquaintance
naturally
extend
itself
among
the
visitant
and
ally
of
his
patient
;
he
be
recommend
from
family
to
family
:
the
fee
begin
to
multiply
;
a
variety
of
footman
appear
every
day
at
his
door
;
he
discontinue
his
sham
circuit
,
and
look
upon
the
present
conjuncture
,
as
that
tide
in
his
affair
,
which
(
accord
to
Shakespeare
)
when
take
at
the
full
,
lead
on
to
fortune
,
he
resolve
,
that
the
opportunity
should
not
be
lose
,
and
apply
himself
with
such
assiduity
to
his
practice
,
that
,
in
all
likelihood
,
he
would
have
carry
the
palm
from
all
his
contemporary
,
have
not
he
split
upon
the
same
rock
which
have
shipwreck
his
hope
before

<EOS>
We
have
formerly
descant
upon
that
venereal
appetite
,
which
glow
in
the
constitution
of
our
adventurer
,
and
which
all
his
philosophy
and
caution
could
hardly
keep
within
bound
:
the
reader
,
therefore
,
will
not
be
much
surprised
,
to
learn
,
that
,
in
the
exercise
of
his
profession
,
he
contract
an
intimacy
with
a
clergyman
's
wife
,
whom
he
attend
as
a
physician
,
and
<EOS>
whose
conjugal
virtue
he
subdue
by
a
long
and
diligent
exertion
of
his
delusive
art
,
while
her
mind
be
enervate
by
sickness
,
and
her
husband
abroad
upon
his
necessary
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
this
unhappy
patient
,
who
be
a
woman
of
an
agreeable
person
,
and
lively
conversation
,
fall
a
sacrifice
to
her
own
security
and
self
-
conceit
:
her
want
of
health
have
confine
her
to
a
sedentary
life
,
and
her
imagination
be
active
and
restless
,
she
have
spend
those
hour
in
reading
,
which
other
young
woman
devote
to
company
and
diversion
:
but
,
as
her
study
be
not
superintend
by
any
person
of
taste
,
she
have
indulge
her
own
fancy
without
method
or
propriety
.
 
<EOS>
the
Spectator
teach
her
to
be
a
critic
and
philosopher
;
from
play
she
learn
poetry
and
wit
:
and
derive
her
knowledge
of
life
from
book
of
history
and
adventure
.
 
<EOS>
fraught
with
these
acquisition
,
and
furnish
by
nature
with
uncommon
vivacity
<EOS>
,
she
despise
her
own
sex
,
and
court
the
society
of
man
,
among
whom
she
think
her
talent
may
be
more
honourably
display
;
fully
confident
of
her
own
virtue
and
sagacity
,
which
enable
her
to
set
all
their
art
at
defiance
.
    
<EOS>
thus
qualify
,
she
,
in
an
evil
hour
,
have
recourse
to
the
advice
of
our
adventurer
,
for
some
ailment
under
which
she
have
long
labour
;
and
find
such
relief
from
his
skill
,
as
very
much
prepossess
her
in
his
favour
:
she
be
no
less
pleased
with
his
obliging
manner
,
than
with
his
physick
;
and
find
much
entertainment
in
his
conversation
,
so
that
the
acquaintance
proceed
to
a
degree
of
intimacy
;
during
which
he
perceive
her
weak
side
,
and
be
enamour
of
her
person
,
flatter
her
out
of
all
her
caution
:
 
<EOS>
the
privilege
of
his
character
furnish
him
with
opportunity
to
lay
snare
for
her
virtue
,
and
take
advantage
of
that
listlessness
,
languor
,
and
indolence
of
the
spirit
,
by
which
all
the
vigilance
of
the
soul
be
relaxed
,
he
,
after
a
long
course
of
attention
and
perseverance
,
find
mean
to
make
shipwreck
of
her
peace
.
    
<EOS>
though
he
master
her
chastity
,
he
could
not
quiet
her
conscience
,
which
incessantly
upbraid
her
with
breach
of
the
marriage
vow
;
nor
do
her
undoer
escape
without
a
share
of
the
reproach
suggest
by
her
penitence
and
remorse
.
 
<EOS>
this
internal
anxiety
co
-
operating
with
her
disease
,
and
,
perhaps
,
with
the
medicine
he
prescribe
,
reduce
her
to
the
brink
of
the
grave
;
when
her
husband
return
from
a
neighbouring
kingdom
,
in
consequence
of
her
earnest
request
,
join
to
the
information
of
her
friend
,
who
have
write
to
him
an
account
of
the
extremity
in
which
she
be
.
 
<EOS>
the
good
man
be
afflict
beyond
measure
,
when
he
see
himself
upon
the
verge
of
lose
a
wife
,
whom
he
have
always
tenderly
love
:
<EOS>
but
,
what
be
his
emotion
,
when
she
,
take
the
first
opportunity
of
his
be
alone
with
her
,
accost
him
to
this
effect
:
    
<EOS>
"
I
be
now
hasten
towards
that
dissolution
,
from
which
no
mortal
be
exempt
;
and
though
the
prospect
of
futurity
be
altogether
clouded
and
uncertain
,
my
conscience
will
not
allow
me
to
plunge
into
eternity
,
without
unburthene
my
mind
,
and
by
an
ingenuous
confession
,
make
all
the
atonement
in
my
power
,
for
the
ingratitude
I
have
be
guilty
of
,
and
the
wrong
I
have
commit
against
a
virtuous
husband
,
who
never
give
me
cause
of
complaint
.
 
<EOS>
You
stand
amazed
at
this
preamble
;
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
how
will
you
be
shock
,
<EOS>
when
I
own
that
I
have
betray
you
in
your
absence
;
that
I
have
trespass
against
God
and
my
marriage
-
vow
,
and
fall
from
the
pride
and
confidence
of
virtue
,
to
the
most
abject
state
of
vice
:
yes
,
I
have
be
unfaithful
to
your
bed
,
have
fall
a
victim
to
the
infernal
insinuation
of
a
villain

who
take
advantage
of
my
weak
and
unguarded
moment

<EOS>
Fathom
be
the
wretch
who
hath
thus
injure
your
honour
,
and
ruin
my
unsuspecting
innocence
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
plead
in
alleviation
of
my
crime
,
but
the
most
sincere
contrition
of
heart
;
and
tho
'
at
any
other
juncture
,
I
could
not
expect
your
forgiveness
,
yet
,
as
I
now
touch
the
goal
of
life
,
I
trust
in
your
humanity
and
benevolence
,
for
that
pardon
which
will
lighten
the
sorrow
of
my
soul

and
those
prayer
which
I
hope
will
entitle
me
to
favour
at
the
throne
of
grace

"
    
<EOS>
the
poor
husband
be
so
much
overwhelmed
with
grief
and
confusion
,
at
this
unexpected
address
,
that
he
could
not
recollect
himself
,
till
after
a
pause
of
several
minute
<EOS>
,
when
utter
a
hollow
groan
,
"
I
will
not
(
say
he
)
aggravate
your
suffering
,
by
reproach
you
with
my
wrong
;
though
your
conduct
hath
be
but
an
ill
return
for
all
my
tenderness
and
esteem
I
look
upon
it
as
a
trial
of
my
christian
patience
,
and
bear
my
misfortune
with
resignation
:
<EOS>
mean
<EOS>
while
,
I
forgive
you
from
my
heart
,
and
fervently
pray
,
that
your
repentance
may
be
acceptable
to
the
father
of
mercy
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
approach
her
bed
side
,
and
embrace
her
in
token
of
his
sincerity
.
 
<EOS>
whether
this
generous
condescension
diffuse
such
a
composure
upon
her
spirit
,
as
tend
to
the
ease
and
refreshment
of
nature
,
which
have
be
almost
exhaust
by
disease
and
vexation
;
certain
it
be
,
that
,
from
this
day
,
she
begin
to
struggle
with
her
malady
in
surprising
effort
;
and
hourly
gain
ground
,
until
her
health
be
pretty
well
re

establish

<EOS>
this
recovery
be
so
far
beyond
the
husband
's
expectation
,
that
he
begin
to
make
very
serious
reflection
on
the
event
,
and
even
to
wish
he
have
not
be
quite
so
precipitate
in
pardon
the
backsliding
of
his
wife
:
for
,
though
he
could
not
withhold
his
compassion
from
a
die
penitent

he
do
not
at
all
relish
the
thought
of
cohabiting

as
usual

with

therefore
consider
his
declaration
as
no
more
than
a
provisional
pardon
,
to
take
place
on
condition
of
her
immediate
death
;
and
,
in
a
little
time
,
not
only
communicate
to
her
his
sentiment
on
this
subject
;
but
also
separate
himself
from
her
company
,
secure
the
evidence
of
her
maid
,
who
have
be
confidante
in
her
amour
with
Fathom

and
immediately
set
on
foot
a
prosecution
against
our
adventurer
,
whose
behaviour
to
his
wife
he
do
not
fail
to
promulgate
,
with
all
its
aggravate

<EOS>
by
these
mean
the

's
name
become
so
notorious
,
that
every
man
be
afraid
of
admit
him
into
his

and
every

ashamed

his
advice

<EOS>
His
Eclipse
,
and
gradual
declination
.
   
<EOS>
misfortune
seldom
come
single
:
upon
the
back
of
this
hue
and
cry
,
he
unluckily
prescribe
phlebotomy
to
a
gentleman
of
some
rank
,
who
chance
to
expire
during
the
operation
;
and
quarrel
with
his
landlord
the
apothecary
,
who
charge
him
with
have
forget
the
good
office
he
have
do
him
in
the
beginning
of
his
career
;
and
desire
he
would
provide
himself
with
another
lodging
.
    
<EOS>
all
these
mishap
tread
upon
the
heel
of
one
another
,
have
a
very
mortifying
effect
upon
his
practice
.
 
<EOS>
at
every
tea
-
table
,
his
name
be
occasionally
put
to
the
torture
,
with
that
of
the
vile
creature
whom
he
have
seduce
;
though
it
be
generally
take
for
grant
,
by
all
those
female
casuist
,
that
she
must
have
make
the
first
advance
:
for
it
could
not
be
suppose
,
that
any
man
would
take
much
trouble
in
lay
scheme
for
the
ruin
of
a
person
,
whose
attraction
be
so
slender
,
especially
consider
the
ill
state
of
her
health
,
a
circumstance
that
seldom
add
to
a
woman
's
beauty
or
good
humour
:
besides
,
she
be
always
a
pert
minx
,
that
affect
singularity
,
and
a
masculine
manner
of
speak
;
and
many
of
them
have
foresee
that
she
would
,
some
time
or
other
,
bring
herself
into
such
a
praemunire
.
    
<EOS>
at
all
gossiping
,
where
the
apothecary
or
his
wife
assist
,
Fathom
's
pride
,
ingratitude
,
and
malpractice
be
canvass
;
in
all
club
of
married
man
,
he
be
mention
with
mark
of
abhorrence
and
detestation
;
and
every
medical
coffeehouse
ring
with
his
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
instance
of
his
ignorance
and
presumption
be
quote
and
many
particular
feign
for
the
purpose
of
defamation
;
so
that
our
hero
be
exactly
in
the
situation
of
a
horseman
,
who
,
in
ride
at
full
speed
for
the
plate
,
be
throw
from
the
saddle
in
the
middle
of
the
race
,
and
leave
without
sense
or
motion
upon
the
plain
.
 
<EOS>
His
progress
,
though
rapid
,
have
be
so
short
,
that
he
could
not
be
suppose
to
have
lay
up
store
against
such
a
day
of
trouble
;
and
as
he
still
cherish
hope
of
surmount
those
obstacle
which
have
so
suddenly
start
up
in
his
way
,
he
would
not
resign
his
equipage
,
nor
retrench
his
expence
;
but
appear
,
as
usual
,
in
all
public
place
,
with
that
serenity
and
confidence
of
feature
which
he
have
never
deposit
;
and
maintain
his
external
pomp
,
upon
the
little
he
have
reserve
in
the
day
of
his
prosperity
,
and
the
credit
he
have
acquire
by
the
punctuality
of
former
payment
.
 
<EOS>
both
these
fund
,
however
,
fail
in
a
very
little
time
;
his
law
-
suit
be
a
gulf
that
swallow
up
all
his
ready
money
;
and
the
gleaning
of
his
practice
be
scarce
sufficient
to
answer
his
pocket
expence
,
which
now
increase
in
proportion
to
the
decrease
of
business
;
for
as
he
have
more
idle
time
,
and
be
less
admit
into
private
family
,
so
he
think
he
have
more
occasion
to
enlarge
his
acquaintance
among
his
own
sex
,
who
alone
be
able
to
support
him
in
his
disgrace
with
the
other
.
    
<EOS>
He
accordingly
list
himself
in
several
club
,
and
endeavour
to
monopolize
the
venereal
branch
of
trade
;
tho
'
<EOS>
this
be
but
an
indifferent
resource
;
for
almost
all
his
patient
of
this
class
,
be
such
as
either
could
not
,
or
would
not
properly
recompence
the
physician
.
    
<EOS>
for
some
time
,
he
linger
in
this
situation
,
without
go
upwards
or
downward
,
float
like
a
wisp
of
straw
,
at
the
turning
of
the
tide
,
until
he
could
no
longer
amuse
the
person
of
whom
he
have
hire
his
coach
horse
,
or
postpone
the
other
demand
,
which
multiply
upon
him
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
then
be
his
chariot
overturn
with
a
hideous
crash
,
and
his
face
so
much
wound
with
the
shiver
of
the
glass
,
which
go
to
piece
in
the
fall
,
that
he
appear
in
the
coffee
house
with
half
a
dozen
black
patch
upon
his
countance
,
give
a
most
circumstantial
detail
of
the
risque
he
have
run
,
and
declare
,
that
he
do
not
believe
he
should
ever
hazard
himself
again
in
any
sort
of
wheel
carriage
.
    
<EOS>
soon
after
this
accident
,
he
take
an
opportunity
of
tell
his
friend
,
in
the
same
public
place
,
that
he
have
turn
away
his
footman
,
on
account
of
his
drunkenness
,
and
be
resolve
,
for
the
future
,
to
keep
none
but
maid
in
his
service
,
because
the
man
servant
be
generally
impudent
,
lazy
,
debauch
,
or
dishon
;
and
,
after
all
,
neither
so
neat
,
handy
,
or
agreeable
,
as
the
other
sex
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
rear
of
this
resolution
,
he
shift
his
lodging
into
a
private
court
,
be
distract
with
the
din
of
carriage
,
that
disturb
the
inhabitant
who
live
towards
the
open
street
;
and
give
his
acquaintance
to
understand
,
that
he
have
a
medical
work
upon
the
anvil
,
which
he
could
not
finish
without
be
indulge
in
silence
and
tranquillity
.
    
<EOS>
in
effect
,
he
gradually
put
on
the
exterior
of
an
author
:
his
watch
,
with
a
horizontal
movement
by
Graham
,
which
he
have
often
mention
,
and
shew
as
a
very
curious
piece
of
workmanship
,
begin
,
about
this
time
,
to
be
very
much
out
of
order
,
and
be
commit
to
the
care
of
a
mender
,
who
be
in
no
hurry
to
restore
it
.
 
<EOS>
His
tye
-
wig
degenerate
into
a
major
;
he
sometimes
appear
without
a
sword
,
and
be
even
observe
in
public
with
a
second
day
's
shirt
:
at
last
,
his
cloath
become
rusty
,
and
when
he
walk
about
the
street
,
his
head
turn
round
in
a
surprising
manner
,
by
an
involuntary
motion
in
his
neck
,
which
he
have
contract
by
an
habit
of
reconnoiter
the
ground
,
that
he
may
avoid
all
dangerous
or
disagreeable
encounter
.
    
<EOS>
Fathom
,
find
himself
descend
the
hill
of
fortune
,
with
an
acquire
gravitation
,
strove
to
catch
at
every
twig
,
in
order
to
stop
or
retard
his
descent
.
 
<EOS>
He
now
regret
the
opportunity
he
have
neglect
,
of
marry
one
of
several
woman
of
moderate
fortune
,
who
have
make
advance
to
him
,
in
the
zenith
of
his
reputation
;
and
endeavour
,
by
force
himself
into
a
low
path
of
life
than
any
he
have
hitherto
trod
,
to
keep
himself
afloat
,
with
the
portion
of
some
tradesman
's
daughter
,
whom
he
mean
to
espouse
.
 
<EOS>
while
he
exert
himself
in
his
pursuit
,
he
happen
,
in
return
from
a
place
about
thirty
mile
from
London
,
to
become
acquainted
,
in
the
stage
coach
,
with
a
young
woman
,
of
a
very
homely
appearance
,
whom
,
from
the
driver
's
information
,
he
understand
to
be
the
the
niece
of
a
country
justice
,
and
daughter
of
a
soap
-
boiler
,
who
have
live
and
die
in
London
,
and
leave
her
,
in
her
infancy
,
sole
heiress
of
his
effect
,
which
amount
to
four
thousand
pound
.
    
<EOS>
the
uncle
,
who
be
her
guardian
,
have
keep
her
sacred
from
the
knowledge
of
the
world
,
resolve
to
effect
a
match
betwixt
her
and
his
own
son
;
and
it
be
with
much
difficulty
he
have
consent
to
this
journey
,
which
she
have
undertake
as
a
visit
to
her
own
mother
,
who
have
marry
a
second
husband
in
town
.
    
<EOS>
Fraught
with
these
anecdote
,
Fathom
begin
to
put
forth
his
gallantry
and
good
humour
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
be
admit
by
the
lady
,
to
the
privilege
of
an
acquaintance
,
in
which
capacity
he
visit
her
during
the
term
of
her
residence
in
London
;
and
as
there
be
no
time
to
be
lose
,
declare
his
honourable
intention
:
he
have
such
a
manifest
advantage
,
in
point
of
personal
accomplishment
,
over
the
young
gentleman
who
be
destine
for
her
husband
,
that
she
do
not
disdain
his
proposal
,
and
before
she
set
out
for
the
country
,
he
have
make
such
progress
in
her
heart
,
that
the
day
be
actually
fix
for
their
nuptial
,
on
which
he
faithfully
promise
to
carry
her
off
in
a
coach
and
six
.
 
<EOS>
how
to
raise
money
for
this
expedition
,
be
all
the
difficulty
that
remain
:
for
,
by
this
time
,
his
finance
be
utterly
dry
up
,
and
his
credit
altogether
exhaust
.
 
<EOS>
upon
a
very
pressing
occasion
,
he
have
formerly
apply
himself
to
a
certain
wealthy
quack
,
who
have
relieve
his
necessity
by
lend
him
a
small
sum
of
money
,
in
return
for
have
communicate
to
him
a
secret
medicine
,
which
he
affirm
to
be
the
most
admirable
specifick
that
ever
be
invent
.
    
<EOS>
the
nostrum
have
be
use
,
and
luckily
for
him
,
succeed
in
the
trial
;
so
that
the
empyrick
,
in
the
midst
of
his
satisfaction
,
begin
to
reflect
,
that
this
same
Fathom
,
who
pretend
to
be
in
possession
of
a
great
many
remedy
,
equally
efficacious
,
would
certainly
become
a
formidable
rival
to
him
,
in
his
business
,
should
he
ever
be
able
to
extricate
himself
from
his
present
difficulty
.
    
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
these
suggestion
,
he
resolve
to
keep
our
adventurer
's
head
under
water
,
by
maintain
him
in
the
most
abject
dependance
;
accordingly
he
have
,
from
time
to
time
,
accommodate
him
with
small
trifle
,
which
barely
serve
to
support
his
existence
,
and
even
for
these
have
take
note
of
hand
,
that
he
may
have
a
scourge
over
his
head
,
in
case
he
should
prove
insolent
or
refractory
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
benefactor
,
Fathom
apply
for
a
reinforcement
of
twenty
guinea
,
which
he
sollicite
with
the
more
confidence
,
as
that
sum
would
certainly
enable
him
to
repay
all
other
obligation
.
 
<EOS>
the
quack
would
advance
the
money
upon
no
other
condition
,
than
that
of
know
the
scheme
,
which
be
explain
,
he
comply
with
Ferdinand
's
request
;
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
privately
dispatch
an
express
to
the
young
lady
's
uncle
,
with
a
full
account
of
the
whole
conspiracy
;
so
that
when
the
doctor
arrive
at
the
inn
,
accord
to
appointment
,
he
be
receive
by
his
worship
,
in
person
,
who
give
him
to
understand
,
that
his
niece
have
change
her
mind
,
and
go
fifty
mile
farther
into
the
country
to
visit
a
relation
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
a
grievous
disappointment
to
Fathom
,
who
really
believe
his
mistress
have
forsake
him
thro
'
mere
levity
and
caprice
,
and
be
not
undeceived
till
several
month
after
her
marriage
with
her
cousin
,
when
,
at
an
accidental
meeting
in
London
,
she
explain
the
story
of
the
secret
intelligence
,
and
excuse
her
marriage
,
as
the
effect
of
rigorous
usage
and
compulsion
.
    
<EOS>
have
our
hero
be
really
enamour
of
her
person
,
he
may
have
,
probably
,
accomplish
his
wish
,
notwithstanding
the
step
she
have
take
:
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
the
case
;
his
passion
be
of
a
different
nature
,
and
the
object
of
it
effectually
without
his
reach
.
 
<EOS>
with
regard
to
his
appetite
for
woman
,
as
it
be
an
infirmity
of
his
constitution
,
which
he
could
not
overcome
,
and
as
he
be
in
no
condition
to
gratify
it
at
a
great
expence
,
he
have
of
late
choose
an
house
-
keeper
from
the
hundred
of
Drury
,
and
,
to
avoid
scandal
,
allow
her
to
assume
his
name
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
intimation
which
have
be
send
to
the
country
justice
,
he
immediately
impute
it
to
the
true
author
,
whom
he
mark
for
his
vengeance
accordingly
;
but
,
in
the
mean
time
,
suppress
his
resentment
,
because
he
,
in
some
measure
,
depend
upon
him
for
subsistence
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
the
quack
,
dread
the
forwardness
and
plausibility
of
our
hero
,
which
may
,
one
time
or
other
,
render
him
independent
,
put
a
stop
to
those
supply
,
on
pretence
of
find
them
inconvenient
;
but
,
out
of
his
friendship
and
good
will
to
Fathom
,
undertake
to
procure
for
him
such
letter
of
recommendation
,
as
would
infallibly
make
his
fortune
in
the
West
-
Indies
,
and
even
to
fit
him
out
in
a
genteel
manner
for
the
voyage
.
 
<EOS>
Ferdinand
preceive
his
drift
,
and
thank
him
for
his
generous
offer
,
which
he
would
not
fail
to
consider
with
all
due
deliberation
:
though
he
be
determine
against
the
proposal
,
but
oblige
to
temporize
,
that
he
may
not
incur
the
displeasure
of
this
man
,
at
whose
mercy
he
lie
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
the
prosecution
against
him
,
in
Doctors
Commons
,
draw
near
a
period

and
the

be
clamorous
for
money

without

he
should
lose
the
advantage
which
his
cause
have
lately
acquire
by
the
death
of
his
antagonist

chief
evidence
;
he
therefore
,
see
every

channel
shut
up

begin
to
doubt

whether
the
risque

apprehend

a

,
and
even
an
effort
to
secrete
it
for
her
own
use
and
contemplation
:
nor
be
this
infirmity
originally
produce
from
indigence
,
inasmuch
as
her
circumstance
have
be
always
affluent
,
and
she
be
now
possess
of
a
considerable
sum
of
money
in
the
fund
;
notwithstanding
which
,
the
avarice
of
her
nature
tempt
her
to
let
lodging
though
few
people
could
live
under
the
same
roof
with
such
an
orignal
,
who
rather
than
be
idle
,
have
often
filch
piece
of
her
own
plate
,
and
charge
her
servant
with
the
theft
,
or
hint
suspicion
of
her
lodger
.
 
<EOS>
Fathom
,
strike
with
the
description
,
soon
perceive
how
this
woman
's
disease
may
be
convert
to
his
advantage
;
and
after
have
obtain
sufficient
intelligence
,
on
pretence
of
satisfy
his
curiosity
,
he
visit
the
widow
,
in
consequence
of
a
bill
at
her
door
,
and
actually
hire
an
apartment
in
her
house
,
whither
he
forthwith
repair
with
his
inamorata
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
before
he
perceive
,
that
his
landlady
's
character
have
not
be
misrepresent
;
he
feed
her
distemper
with
diver
inconsiderable
trinket
,
such
as
copper
medal
,
cork
screw
,
odd
buckle
,
and
a
paultry
seal
set
in
silver
,
which
be
,
at
different
time
,
lay
as
bait
for
her
infirmity
,
and
always
convey'd
<EOS>
away
with
remarkable
eagerness
,
which
he
and
his
Dulcinea
take
pleasure
in
observe
from
an
unsuspected
place
.
 
<EOS>
thus
confirm
in
his
opinion
,
he
,
at
length
,
take
an
opportunity
of
expose
a
metal
watch
that
belong
to
his
mistress
,
and
see
it
seize
,
with
great
satisfaction
,
in
the
absence
of
his
help
-
mate
,
who
have
go
abroad
on
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
accord
to
instruction
,
she
soon
return
,
and
begin
to
raise
a
terrible
clamour
about
the
loss
of
her
watch
;
upon
which
she
be
condole
by
her
landlady
,
who
seem
to
doubt
the
integrity
of
the
maid
,
and
even
propose
,
that
Mrs
Fathom
should
apply
to
some
justice
of
the
peace
,
for
a
warrant
to
search
the
servant
's
trunk
.
    
<EOS>
the
lady
thank
her
for
the
good
advice
,
in
compliance
with
which
,
she
have
immediate
recourse
to
a
magistrate
,
who
grant
a
search
warrant
,
not
against
the
maid
,
but
the
mistress
;
and
she
,
in
a
little
time
,
return
with
the
constable
at
her
back
.
    
<EOS>
these
precaution
be
take
,
doctor
Fathom
desire
a
private
conference
with
the
old
gentlewoman
,
in
which
he
give
her
to
understand
,
that
he
have
undoubte
proof
of
her
have
secrete
,
not
only
the
watch
,
but
also
several
other
odd
thing
,
of
less
consequence
,
which
he
have
lose
since
his
residence
in
her
house
:
he
then
shew
the
warrant
he
have
obtain
against
her
,
and
ask
if
she
have
any
thing
to
offer
,
why
the
constable
should
not
do
his
duty
.
 
<EOS>
Inexpressible
be
the
anguish
and
confusion
of
the
defendant
,
when
she
find
herself
thus
entrap
,
and
reflect
that
she
be
on
the
point
of
be
detect
of
felony
;
for
she
at
once
conclude
,
that
the
snare
be
lay
for
her
,
and
know
,
that
the
officer
of
justice
would
certainly
find
the
unlucky
watch
in
one
of
the
drawer
of
her
scrutore
.
    
<EOS>
torture
with
these
suggestion
,
afraid
of
public
disgrace
,
and
dread
the
consequence
of
legal
conviction
,
she
fall
on
her
knee
before
the
injure
Fathom
,
and
,
after
have
impute
her
crime
to
the
temptation
of
necessity
,
implore
his
compassion
,
promise
to
restore
the
watch
,
and
every
thing
she
have
take
,
and
beg
he
would
dismiss
the
constable
,
that
her
reputation
may
not
suffer
in
the
eye
of
the
world
.
    
<EOS>
Ferdinand
,
with
a
severity
of
countenance
purposely
assume
,
observe
,
that
be
she
really
indigent
,
he
have
charity
enough
to
forgive
what
she
have
do
;
but
,
as
he
know
her
circumstance
be
opulent
,
he
look
upon
this
excuse
as
an
aggravation
of
her
guilt
,
which
be
certainly
the
effect
of
a
vicious
inclination
,
and
he
be
therefore
determined
to
prosecute
her
with
the
utmost
severity
of
the
law
,
as
an
example
and
terror
to
other
,
who
may
be
infect
with
the
same
evil
disposition
.
 
<EOS>
find
him
deaf
to
all
her
tear
and
intreatie
,
she
change
the
note
,
and
offer
him
one
hundred
guinea
,
if
he
would
compromise
the
affair
,
and
drop
the
prosecution
,
so
as
that
her
character
should
sustain
no
damage
;
after
much
argumentation
,
he
consent
to
accept
of
double
the
sum
,
which
be
instantly

,
doctor
Fathom
tell
the
constable
,
that
the
watch
be

and
for
once
her
reputation
be
patch
up
.
 
<EOS>
this
seasonable
,
supply
enable
our
hero
to
stand
trial
with
his
adversary
,
who
be
nonsuite
,
and
also
to
mend
his
external
appearance
,
which
of
late
have
not
be
extremely
magnificent
,
    
soon
after
this
gleam
of
good
fortune
,
a
tradesman
,
to
whom
he
be
considerably
indebted
,
see
no
other
probable
mean
to
recover
his
money
,
introduce
Fathom
to
the
acquaintance
of
a
young
widow
who
lodge
at
his
house
,
and
be
say
to
be
in
possession
of
a
considerable
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
consider
the
step
that
be
take
,
it
would
have
be
almost
impossible
for
him
to
miscarry
in
his
address
:
the
lady
have
be
breed
in
the
country
,
be
unacquainted
with
the
world
,
and
of
a
very
sanguine
disposition
,
which
her
short
trial
of
matrimony
have
not
serve
to
cool
.
 
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
be
instruct
to
call
at
the
tradesman
's
house
,
as
if
by
accident
,
at
an
appoint
time
,
when
the
widow
be
drink
tea
with
her
landlady
:
on
these
occasion
he
always
behave
to
admiration
.
    
<EOS>
She
like
his
person
,
and
praise
his
politeness
,
good
humour
,
and
good
sense
:
his
confederate
extoll
him
as
a
prodigy
of
learning
,
taste
,
and
good
nature
:
they
likewise
represent
him
as
a
person
on
the
eve
of
eclipse
all
his
competitor
in
physick
:
an
acquaintance
and
intimacy
soon
ensue
,
nor
be
he
restrict
in
point
of
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
he
succeed
in
his
endeavour
,
and
one
evening
,
on
pretence
of
attend
her
to
the
play
,
he
accompany
her
to
the
Fleet
,
where
they
be
marry
,
in
presence
of
the
tradesman
and
his
wife
,
who
be
of
the
party
.
    
<EOS>
this
grand
affair
be
accomplish
to
his
satisfaction
,
he
next
day
,
visit
her
brother
,
who
be
a
counsellor
of
the
Temple
,
to
make
him
acquaint
with
the
step
his
sister
have
take
;
and
though
the
lawyer
be
not
a
little
mortified
,
to
find
she
have
make
such
a
clandestine
match
,
he
behave
civilly
to
his
new
brother
-
in
-
law
,
and
give
him
to
understand
,
that
his
wife
's
fortune
consist
of
a
jointure
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
pound
a
year
,
and
fifteen
hundred
pound
bequeath
to
her
during
her
widowhood
,
by
her
own
father
,
who
have
take
the
precaution
of
settle
it
in
the
hand
of
trustee
,
in
such
a
manner
as
that
any
husband
she
may
afterwards
espouse
,
should
be
restrict
from
encroach
upon
the
capital
,
which
be
reserve
for
the
benefit
of
her
heir
.
 
<EOS>
this
intimation
be
far
from
be
agreeable
to
our
hero
,
who
have
be
inform
,
that
this
sum
be
absolutely
at
the
lady
's
disposal
,
and
have
actually
destine
the
great
part
of
it
for
the
payment
of
his
debt
,
for
defray
the
expence
of
furnish
an
elegant
house
,
and
set
up
a
new
equipage
.
    
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
disappointment
,
he
resolve
to
carry
on
his
plan
,
upon
the
credit
of
his
marriage
,
which
be
publish
in
a
very
pompous
article
of
the
news
paper
;
a
chariot
be
bespoke
,
a
ready
furnished
house
immediately
take
,
and
doctor
Fathom
begin
to
re
-
appear
in
all
his
former
splendor
.
    
<EOS>
His
good
friend
the
empirick
,
alarm
at
this
event
,
which
not
only
raise
our
adventurer
into
the
sphere
of
a
dangerous
rival
,
but
also
furnish
him
with
mean
to
revenge
the
ill
office
he
have
sustain
at
his
hand
,
on
the
adventure
of
the
former
match
<EOS>
;
for
,
by
this
time
,
Fathom
have
give
him
some
hint
,
import
,
that
he
be
not
ignorant
of
his
treacherous
behaviour
:
rouse
,
I
say
,
by
these
consideration
,
he
employ
one
of
his
emissary
,
who
have
some
knowledge
of
Fathom
's
brother
-
in
-
law
,
to
prejudice
him
against
our
adventurer
,
whom
he
represent
as
a
needy
sharper
,
not
only
overwhelmed
with
debt
and
disgrace
,
but
likewise
previously
marry
to
a
poor
woman
,
who
be
prevent
by
nothing
but
want
,
from
seek
redress
at
law
.
 
<EOS>
to
confirm
these
assertion
,
he
give
him
a
detail
of
Fathom
's
incumbrance
,
which
he
have
learn
for
the
purpose
,
and
even
bring
the
counsellor
in
company
with
the
person
who
have
live
with
our
hero
before
marriage
,
and
who
be
so
much
incensed
at
her
abrupt
dismission
,
that
she
do
not
scruple
to
corroborate
these
allegation
of
the
informer
.
    
<EOS>
the
lawyer
,
startle
at
this
intelligence
,
set
on
foot
a
minute
inquiry
into
the
life
and
conversation
of
the
doctor
,
which
turn
out
so
little
to
the
advantage
of
his
character
and
circumstance
,
that
he
resolve
,
if
possible
,
to
disunite
him
from
his
family
,
and
as
a
previous
step
,
repeat
to
his
sister
,
all
that
he
have
hear
to
the
prejudice
of
her
husband
,
not
forget
to
produce
the
evidence
of
his
mistress
,
who
lay
claim
to
him
by
a
prior
title
,
which
,
she
pretend
,
could
be
prove
by
the
testimony
of
the
clergyman
who
join
them
.
 
<EOS>
such
an
explanation
could
not
fail
to
inflame
the
resentment
of
the
injure
wife
,
who
,
at
the
very
first
opportunity
,
give
a
loose
to
the
impetuosity
of
her
temper
,
upbraid
our
hero
with
the
most
bitter
invective
for
his
perfidious
dealing
.
    
<EOS>
Ferdinand
,
conscious
of
his
own
innocence
,
which
he
have
not
always
to
plead
,
far
from
attempt
to
soothe
her
indignation
,
assume
the
authority
and
prerogative
of
an
husband
,
and
sharply
reprehend
her
for
her
credulity
and
indecent
warmth
.
 
<EOS>
this
rebuke
,
instead
of
silence
,
give
new
spirit
and
volubility
to
her
reproach
,
in
the
course
of
which
,
she
plainly
tax
him
with
want
of
honesty
and
affection
,
and
say
,
that
though
his
pretence
be
love
,
his
aim
be
no
other
than
a
base
design
upon
her
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
Fathom
,
sting
with
these
accusation
,
which
he
really
do
not
deserve
,
reply
with
uncommon
heat
,
and
charge
her
,
in
his
turn
,
with
want
of
sincerity
and
candour
,
in
the
false
account
she
have
give
of
that
same
fortune
,
before
marriage
:
he
even
magnify
his
own
condescension
,
in
surrender
his
liberty
to
a
woman
,
who
have
so
little
to
recommend
her
to
the
address
of
the
other
sex
;
a
reflection
which
provoke
this
mild
creature
to
such
a
degree
of
animosity
,
that
,
forget
her
duty
and
allegiance
,
she
lend
him
a
box
on
the
ear
,
with
such
energy
as
make
his
eye
water
;
and
he
,
for
the
honour
of
his
manhood
and
sovereignty
,
have
wash
her
face
with
a
dish
of
tea
,
withdraw
abruptly
,
to
a
coffee
house
in
the
neighbourhood
,
where
he
have
not
long
remain
,
when
his
passion
subside
,
and
he
then
see
the
expediency
of
an
immediate
reconciliation
,
which
he
resolve
to
purchase
,
even
at
the
expence
of
a
submission
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
pity
that
such
a
salutary
resolution
have
not
be
sooner
take
:
<EOS>
for
when
he
return
to
his
own
house
,
he
understand
,
that
Mrs
Fathom
have
go
abroad
in
an
hackney
coach
:
and
upon
examine
her
apartment
,
in
lieu
of
her
cloath
and
trinket
,
which
she
have
remove
with
admirable
dexterity
and
dispatch
,
he
find
this
billet
in
one
of
the
drawer
of
her
buroe
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
be
convince
that
you
be
a
cheat
and
an
impostor
,
I
have
withdraw
myself
from
your
cruelty
and
machination
,
with
a
view
to
sollicit
the
protection
of
the
law
:
and
I
doubt
not
<EOS>
but
I
shall
soon
be
able
to
prove
,
that
you
have
no
just
title
to
,
or
demand
upon
the
person
or
effect
of
the
unfortunate
Sarah
Muddy
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
time
have
be
when
Mr
Fathom
would
have
allow
Mrs
Muddy
to
refine
at
her
leisure
,
and
bless
God
for
his
happy
deliverance
;
but
at
present
the
case
be
quite
alter
.
 
<EOS>
smart
as
he
be
,
from
the
expence
of
law
suit
,
he
dread
a
prosecution
for
bigamy
<EOS>
which
(
though
he
have
justice
on
his
side
)
<EOS>
he
know
he
could
not
of
himself
support
:
besides
,
all
his
other
scheme
of
life
be
frustrate
by
this
unlucky
elopement
:
he
therefore
speedily
determine
to
anticipate
,
as
much
as
in
him
lie
,
the
malice
of
his
enemy
,
and
to
obtain
,
without
delay
,
authentic
document
of
his
marriage
.
    
<EOS>
with
this
view
he
hasten
to
the
house
of
the
tradesman
,
who
,
with
his
wife
,
have
be
witness
to
the
ceremony
and
consummation
;
and
,
in
order
to
interest
them
the
more
warmly
in
his
cause
,
make
a
pathetic
recital
of
this
unhappy
breach
,
in
which
he
have
suffer
such
injury
and
insult
:
but
all
his
rhetoric
would
not
avail
;
Mrs
Muddy
have
be
beforehand
with
him
,
and
prove
the
well
orator
of
the
two
;
for
she
have
assail
this
honest
couple
with
such
trope
and
figure
of
eloquence
,
as
be
altogether
irresistible
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
they
hear
our
hero
,
to
an
end
,
with
great
patience
:
then
the
wife
,
who
be
the
common
mouth
,
upon
all
such
occasion
,
contract
her
feature
into
a
very
formal
disposition
,
"
I
will
assure
you
,
say
she
,
doctor
Fathom
,
my
husband
and
I
have
be
in
a
very
great
terrification
and
numbplush
,
to
hear
such
bad
thing
of
a
person
,
whom
,
as
one
may
say
,
we
think
a
worthy
gentleman
,
and
be
ready
to
serve
at
all
time
,
by
day
and
by
night
,
as
the
saying
be
;
and
besides
,
for
all
that
,
you
know

and
God
know

as
we
be
dustrious
people

and
work
hard
for
what
we
get

I

to
my

Timothy
,
say
I
,
'
tis
a
very
hard
thing
for

to

and
you

doctor

that
be
before
your

bill
begin
:
<EOS>
but
,
howsomever
,
little
do
I
think
,
as
how
a
gentleman
of
your
learning
,
would
go
to
deceive
a
poor
gentlewoman
,
when
you
have
another
wife
alive
.
"
    
<EOS>
in
vain
do
our
adventurer
endeavour
to
vindicate
himself
from
this
aspersion
;
the
good
woman
,
like
a
great
many
modern
disputant
,
proceed
with
her
declamation
,
without
seem
to
hear
what
be
say
on
the
other
side
of
the
question
;
and
the
husband
be
altogether
neutral
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
Ferdinand
find
all
his
protestation
ineffectual
,
"
well
,
say
he
,
though
you
be
resolve

I
see
,
to
discredit
all
that
I
can
say
in
opposition
to
that
scandalous
slander

of
which
I
can
easily
acquit
myself
in
a

,
surely
you
will
not
refuse

grant
me
a

signify
,
that
you

You
shall
excuse
us
;
(
reply
the
female
orator
)
<EOS>
people
can
not
be
too
wary
in
sign
their
name

in
this
wicked
world
;
many
a

have
be
bring
to
ruination
by
sign
his

my

shall
not
,
with
my
good
will

draw
himself
into
such
a
primmineery

"
    
<EOS>
Fathom
,
alarm'd
<EOS>
at
this
refusal
,
earnestly
argue
against
the
inhumanity
and
injustice
of
it
,
appeal
to
their
own
conscience
for
the
reasonableness
of
his
proposal
;
but
,
from
the
evasive
answer
of
the
wife
,
he
have
reason
to
believe
,
that
,
long
before
the
time
of
trial
,
they
would
take
care
to
have
forget
the
whole
transaction
.
    
<EOS>
though
he
be
equally
confound
and
incense
at
this
instance
of
their
perfidy
,
he
durst
not
manifest
his
indignation
,
conscious
of
the
advantage
they
have
over
him
in
diver
respect
;
but
repair
,
without
loss
of
time
,
to
the
lodging
of
the
clergyman
who
have
noose
him
,
resolve
to
consult
his
register
,
and
secure
his
evidence
.
 
<EOS>
here
too
his
evil
genius
have
get
the
start
of
him
,
for
the
worthy
ecclesiastic
not
only
could
not
recollect
his
feature
,
or
find
his
name
in
the
register
;
but
,
when
importune
by
his
press
remonstrance
,
take
umbrage
at
the
freedom
of
his
behaviour
,
and
threaten
,
if
he
would
not
immediately
take
himself
away
,
to
raise
the
posse
of
the
Fleet
,
for
the
safety
of
his
own
person

<EOS>
Rather
than
put
the
pastor
to
the
trouble
of
alarm
his
flock
,
he
retreat
with
a
heavy
heart
,
and
go
in
quest
of
his
mistress
,
whom
he
have
dismiss
at
his
marriage
,
in
hope
of
effect
a
reconciliation
,
and
prevent
her
from
join
in
the
conspiracy
against
him
;
but
,
alas
,
he
meet
with
such
a
reception
,
as
he
have
reason
to
expect
from
a
slight
woman
,
who
have
never
feel
any
real
attachment
for
his
person
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
upbraid
him
with
his
cruelty
,
in
leave
her
as
a
mistress
;
but
,
with
a
species
of
effrontery
,
never
enough
to
be
admire

reproach
him
with
his
villainy
,
in
abandon
her

who

true

to
go

ruin
a
poor

by
whose
fortune

<EOS>
when
he
attempt
to
expostulate
with
this
virago

upon
the
barbarity
of
this
assertion

she
very
prudently
decline
engage
in
private
conversation
with
such
an
artful

wicked
man

in

<EOS>
the
last
resource
,
and
that
upon
which
he
least
depend
,
be
the
advice
and
assistance
of
his
old
friend
the
empirick
,
with
whom
he
still
maintain
a
slight
correspondence
;
and
to
whose
house
he
steer
his
course

in
great
perplexity

tribulation

<EOS>
that
gentleman
,
instead
of
console
him
with
assurance
of
friendship
and
protection
,
faithfully
recapitulate
all
the
instance
of
his
indiscretion
and
misconduct
,
tax
him
with
want
of
sincerity
in
the
West

India
affair
,
as
well
as
with
want
of
honesty
in
this
last
marriage
,
while
his
former

be
alive

and
finally
,
remind
him
of
his
note
,
which
he
desire
may
be
immediately
take
up
,
as
he
(
the
quack

have
present
occasion
for
a
sum
of
money

<EOS>
Ferdinand
see
it
would
be
impracticable
to
derive
any
succour
from
this
quarter
,
sneak
homeward
,
in
order
to
hold
a
consultation
with
his
own
thought
;
and
the
first
object
that
present
itself
to
his
eye
,
when
he
enter
his
apartment
,
be
a
letter
from
the
tradesman
,
with
his
account
inclose
,
amount
to
fifty
-
five
pound
,
which
the
writer
desire
may
be
pay
without

<EOS>
before

have
time
to
peruse
the
article

he
receive
a
summon

in

a
bill
of
indictment
for
bigamy

find
against
him
in
Hicks's

while
he
be
revolve
measure
to
avert
these
storm

another
billet
arrive
from
a
certain
attorney

give
him
to

that

have
order

to
sue
him
for
the
payment
of
several

unless
he
would
take
them
up
in
three

from
the
date

<EOS>
such
a
concurrence
of
sinister
event
,
make
a
deep
impression
upon
the
mind
of
our
adventurer
:
all
his
fortitude
be
insufficient
to
bear
him
up
against
this
torrent
of
misfortune
;
his
resource
be
all
dry
up
,
his
invention
fail
,
and
his
reflection
begin
to
take
a
new
turn
.
 
<EOS>
"
to
what
purpose
(
say
he
to
himself
)
<EOS>
have
I
desert
the
path
of
integrity

exhaust
a
fruitful

of
acquire
a
splendid

I
have
suffer
such
a

bring
myself
to

of
inevitable
destruction

<EOS>
by
a
virtuous
exertion

those

I
inherit
from

I
may

long
before

have
render
myself
independent

conspicuous

lofty

expand
its
leafy
arm

project
a
noble
shade

and
tower
the
glory
of

have
pay
the
debt
of
gratitude
to
my
benefactor

make
their
heart
sing
with
joy
for
the
happy
effect

their
benevolence

I
should
have
be
a
bulwark
to
my

a
shelter
to
my

see
my
fame
diffuse
like

feel
the

danger

reduce
to
misery

shame
,
aggravate
by
a
conscience
load
with
treachery

guilt

<EOS>
I
have
abuse
the
confidence

generosity
of
my
patron
;
I
have
defraud
his

under
the
mask
of
sincerity

false

It

I

on

wretchedness

without

perhaps

in

be
that
as
it

after
a
tedious

fruitless
exercise

resolve
to

a

these

<EOS>
He
no

recollect
himself
from
the
shock

dispatch
a

unable

such
powerful

he
have
resolve
even
to
abandon

retire
into
another
country

in

from

He

<EOS>
the

feel
the
force
of
his
expostulation

and
though
he
would
by
no
mean
suppose
him
innocent
of
the
charge
of
bigamy

yet
under
the
pretext
of
humanity

commiseration

he
undertake

creditor
;
nor
do
he
forget
to
declare
his
intention
of
retire
into
another
country
,
where
he
may
have
some
chance
of
earn
a
subsistence
,
which
he
have
so
long
toil
for
to
no
purpose
in
England
.
    
<EOS>
this
last
declaration
he
make
in
consequence
of
the
jealous
disposition
of
the
quack
,
who
,
he
know
,
have
long
look
upon
him
in
the
odious
light
of
an
interlope
rival
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
reap
no
benefit
from
this
supplication
,
which
serve
only
to
gratify
the
pride
of
Buffalo
,
who
produce
the
extravagant
encomium
which
Fathom
have
bestow
upon
him
,
as
so
many
testimonial
of
his
foe
's
bear
witness
to
his
virtue
.
     
<EOS>
Fathom
be
safely
house
,
the
reader
be
entertain
with
a
retrospect
.
   
<EOS>
but
now
it
be
high
time
to
leave
our
adventurer
to
chew
the
cud
of
reflexion
and
remorse
in
this
solitary
mansion
,
that
we
may
trace
Renaldo
in
the
several
step
he
take
to
assert
his
right
,
and
do
justice
to
his
family
.
 
<EOS>
never
man
indulge
a
more
melancholy
train
of
idea
than
that
which
accompaie
him
in
his
journey
to
the
imperial
court
:
for
notwithstanding
the
manifold
reason
he
have
to
expect
an
happy
issue
to
his
aim
,
his
imagination
be
incessantly
infect
with
something
that
chill
his
nerve
,
and
sadden
his
heart
,
recur
,
with
quick
succession
,
like
the
unwearied
wave
that
beat
upon
the
bleak
,
inhospitable
Greenland
shore
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
the
reader
will
easily
suppose
,
be
no
other
than
the
remembrance
of
the
forlorn
Monimia
,
whose
image
appear
to
his
fancy
in
different
attitude
accord
to
the
prevelance
of
the
passion
which
rage
in
his
bosom
.
    
<EOS>
sometimes
he
view
her
in
the
light
of
apostacy
,
and
then
his
soul
be
madden
with
indignation
and
despair
;
but
these
transitory
blast
be
not
able
to
efface
the
impression
she
have
formerly
make
upon
his
heart
;
impression
which
he
have
so
often
and
so
long
contemplate
with
inconvincible
rapture
.
 
<EOS>
these
picture
still
remain
,
represent
her
fair
as
the
most
perfect
idea
of
beauty
,
soft
and
tender
as
an
angel
of
mercy
and
compassion
,
warm
with
every
virtue
of
the
heart
,
and
adorn
with
every
accomplishment
of
human
nature
;
yet
the
alarming
contrast
come
still
in
the
rear
of
this
recollection
;
so
that
his
soul
be
by
turn
agitate
by
the
tempest
of
horror
,
and
overwhelm
by
the
flood
of
grief
.
    
<EOS>
He
recall
the
moment
on
which
he
first
behold
her
,
with
that
pleasing
regret
which
attend
the
memory
of
a
dear
deceased
friend
<EOS>
;
then
he
bitterly
curse
it
,
as
the
source
of
all
his
misfortune
and
affliction
;
he
thank
heaven
for
have
bless
him
with
a
friend
to
detect
her
perfidy
and
ingratitude
;
then
ardently
wish
he
have
still
continue
under
the
influence
of
her
delusion
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
the
loneliness
of
his
situation
aggravate
every
horror
of
his
reflection
;
for
,
as
he
find
himself
without
company
,
his
imagination
be
never
sollicite
,
or
his
attention
divert
from
these
subject
of
woe
;
and
he
travel
to
Brussels
in
a
reverie
,
fraught
with
such
torment
as
must
have
entirely
wreck
his
reason
,
have
not
providence
interpose
in
his
behalf
.
    
<EOS>
He
be
,
by
his
postilion
,
conduct
to
one
of
the
good
inn
in
the
place
,
where
he
understand
the
cloth
be
already
lay
for
supper
;
and
as
the
ordinary
be
open
to
stranger
,
in
all
those
house
of
entertainment
,
he
introduce
himself
into
the
company
,
with
a
view
to
alleviate
,
in
some
measure
,
his
sorrow
and
chagrin
,
by
the
conversation
of
his
fellow
guest
;
yet
he
be
so
ill
prepared
to
obtain
the
relief
which
he
court
,
that
he
enter
the
apartment
,
and
sit
down
to
table
,
without
distinguish
either
the
number
or
countenance
of
those
who
be
present
;
though
he
himself
do
not
remain
so
unregarded
.
 
<EOS>
His
mein
and
deportment
produce
a
prepossession
in
his
favour
;
and
the
air
of
affliction
,
so
remarkable
in
his
visage
,
do
not
fail
to
attract
their
sympathy
and
observation
.
    
<EOS>
among
the
rest
,
be
an
irish
officer
,
in
the
austrian
service

who
have
eye
Renaldo
attentively

I
have
the
honour
to
serve
upon

Rhine

during

"
 
<EOS>
the
youth
hear
his
own
name
mention
,
lift
up
his
eye
,
and
at
once
recognize
the
other
to
be
a
gentleman
who
have
be
a
captain
in
his
father
's
regiment
,
run
forwards
,
and
embrace
him
with
great
affection
.
    
<EOS>
this
be
,
in
diver
respect
,
a
fortunate
rencounter
for
young
Melvile
;
as
the
officer
be
not
only
perfectly
well
acquaint
with
the
situation
of
the
count
's
family
,
but
also
resolve
,
in
a
few
day
,
to
set
out
for
Vienna
,
whether
he
promise
to
accompany
Renaldo

as
soon

lie
the

way

<EOS>
before
the
day
fix
for
their
departure
arrive
,
this
gentleman
find
mean
to
insinuate
himself
so
far
into
the
confidence
of
the
count
,
as
to
learn
the
cause
of
that
distress
which
he
have
observe
in
his
feature
at
their
first
meeting
;
and
be
a
gentleman
of
uncommon
vivacity
,
as
well
as
sincerely
attach
to
the
family
of
Melvile

to
which
he
have
owe
his
promotion
;

exert
all
his

in
amuse
the

reason
down
the
mortification
of

He

endeavour
to
wean
his
attention
from
the
lose
Monimia

by
engage
it
upon
his
domestic
affair

and
upon
the
wrong
of
his
mother

who
,
he
give
him
to
understand
,
be
languish
under
the
tyranny
of
his
father

<EOS>
this
be
a
note
that
effectually
rouse
him
from
the
lethargy
of
his
sorrow
;
and
the
desire
of
take
vengeance
on
the
oppressor
,
who
have
ruin
his
fortune
,

make
his
near
relation
miserable
,
so
entirely
engross
his
thought
,
as
to
leave
no
room
for
other
consideration

<EOS>
during
their
journey
to
Austria
,
major
Farrel
(
that
be
the
name
of
his
fellow
traveller
)
inform
him
of
many
circumstance
touch
his
father
's
house
,
to
which
himself
be
an
utter
stranger

<EOS>
"
the
conduct
of
your
mother
,
say
he
,
in
marry
count
Trebasi
,
be
not
at
all
agreeable
either
to
the
friend
of
the
count
Melvile
,
or
to
her
own
relation
,
who
know
her
second
husband
to
be
a
man
of
a
violent
temper

and
rapacious
disposition
,
which
the
nature
of
his
education

employment

have
serve
rather
to
inflame
than
allay

you
well
know
he
be
a
partizan
during
the
whole
course
of
the
late
war

<EOS>
They
be
,
moreover

equally
surprised

chagrined

seizing
upon
that
inheritance
which
of
right
belong

you

by
the
law
of
Hungary

be
unalienable
from
the
heir
of
blood

<EOS>
nevertheless
,
they
be
now
fully
convince
,
that
she
hath
more
than
sufficiently
attone
for
her
indiscretion

by
the
barbarity
of
her
husband

who
hath
not

seclude
her
from

even
confine
her
to
the
west
tower
of
your
father

where
she
be
say
to
be
keep
close
prisoner
,

subject
to
all
sort
of
inconvenience
and
mortification

<EOS>
this
severity
she
be
believe
to
have
incur

of
have
expostulate
with

upon
his
unjust
behaviour

actually
shut
up
in
some
convent
in
Vienna

your

the
memory
of
your
noble
father
be
so
dear
to
all
those
who
be

with
his

and
the
suffering
of

raise
such
a
spirit
of
resentment
against
her
cruel
jailor

that
nothing

your

to
begin
the
prosecution

give
a
sanction
to
the
measure

restore

recount
to

his
uncommon
transaction
with
the
benevolent

the
letter
of

with
impatience

to
chastise
count
Trebasi

his
perfidious
conduct
to
the
widow

justice

<EOS>
these
just
and
salutary
representation
have
a
due
effect
upon
Renaldo
,
who
no
sooner
arrive
at
the
capital
of
Austria
,
than
he
wait
upon
a
certain
prince
of
distinction
,
to
whose
patronage
he
be
recommend
;
and
from
whom
he
meet
with
a
very
cordial
reception
,
not
only
on
account
of
his
credential

but
also
for
the
sake
of
his
father

be
well
known

his
highness

<EOS>
He
hear
his
complaint
with
great
patience

affability
,
assure
him
of
his
assistance

protection
,
and
even
undertake
to
introduce
him
to
the
empress
queen

who
would
not
suffer
the
weak
of

Melvile

easily
interested

suit

immediately
commence
against
count
Trebasi

who
on
his
side
be
not
idle
,
but
prepare
with
incredible
industry
for
the
assault

resolve
to
maintain
with
his

power
the
acquisition
he
have
make

<EOS>
the
law
of
Hungary
,
like
those
of
some
other
country
I
could
name
,
afford
so
many
subterfuge
for
the
purpose
of
perfidy
and
fraud
,
that
it
be
no
wonder
our
youth
begin
to
complain
of
the
slow
progress
of
his
affair

especially
as
he
glow
with
the
most
eager
desire
of
redress
the
grievance
of
his

whose
suffering
he
do
not
doubt
be
double

the
institution

his
process
against
their
tormentor

<EOS>
He
impart
his
sentiment
on
this
head
to
his
friend
;
and
,
as
his
apprehension
every
moment
increase
,
plainly
tell
him
he
could
no

live
without
make
some
effort
to
see
those
with
whom
he
be
so
nearly
connect
in
point
of
blood
and
affection
<EOS>
:
he
therefore
resolve
to
repair
immediately
to
Presburg
,
and
accord
to
the
intelligence
he
should
procure
,
essay
to
see
and
converse
with
his
mother
,
tho
'
at
the
hazard
of
his
life

<EOS>
Renaldo
abridge
the
proceeding
at
law
,

approve
himself
the
son
of
his
father

<EOS>
the
major
find
him
determine
,
insist
upon
attend
him
in
his
expedition
,
and
they
set
out
together
for
Presburg
,
where
they
privately
arrive
in
the
dark
,
resolve
to
keep
themselves
conceal
at
the
house
of
a
friend
,
until
they
should
have
form
some
plan
for
their
future
operation
.
 
<EOS>
here
they
be
inform
that
count
Trebasi
's
castle
be
altogether
inaccessible
;
that
all
the
servant
who
be
suppose
to
have
the
least
veneration
or
compassion
for
the
countess
,
be
dismiss
;
and
that
since
Renaldo
be
know
to
be
in
Germany
,
the
vigilance
and
caution
of
that
cruel
husband
be
redouble
to
such
a
degree
,
that
no
body
know
whether
his
unfortunate
lady
be
actually
alive
or
dead
.
    
<EOS>
Farrel
perceive
Melvile
exceedingly
affect
with
this
intimation
,
and
hear
him
declare
that
he
would
never
quit
Presburg
,
until
he
should
have
enter
the
house
,
and
remove
his
doubt
on
that
interesting
subject
;
not
only
argue
with
great
vehemence
against
such
an
attempt
,
as
equally
dangerous
and
indiscreet
,
but
solemnly
swear
he
would
prevent
his
purpose
,
by
discover
his
design
to
the
family
,
unless
he
would
promise
to
listen
to
a
more
moderate
and
feasible
expedient
.
    
<EOS>
He
then
propose
that
he
himself
should
appear
in
the
equipage
of
one
of
those
travel
Savoyards
who
stroll
about
Europe
,
amusing
ignorant
people
with
the
effect
of
a
magic
lanthorn
,
and
in
that
disguise
endeavour
to
obtain
admittance
from
the
servant
of
Trebasi
,
among
whom
he
may
make
such
inquiry
,
as
would
deliver
Melvile
from
his
present
uneasy
suspense
.
    
<EOS>
this
proposal
be
embrace
,
tho
'
reluctantly
,
by
Renaldo
,
who
be
unwilling
to
expose
his
friend
to
the
least
danger
or
disgrace
;
and
the
major
be
next
day
provide
with
the
habit
and
implement
of
his
new
profession
,
together
with
a
ragged
attendant
who
precede
him
,
extort
music
from
a
paltry
viole
,
approach
the
castle
-
gate
,
and
proclaim
his
show
so
naturally
in
a
yell
partaking
of
the
scream
of
Savoy
and
the
howl
of
Ireland
,
that
one
would
have
imagine
he
have
be
conductor
to
madam
Catherina
from
his
cradle
.
 
<EOS>
so
far
his
stratagem
succeed
:
<EOS>
he
have
not
long
stand
in
wait
,
before
he
be
invite
into
the
courtyard
,
where
the
servant
form
a
ring
,
and
dance
to
the
effort
of
his
companion
's
skill
;
then
he
be
conduct
into
the
buttery
,
where
he
exhibit
his
figure
on
the
wall
and
his
princess
on
the
floor
;
and
while
they
regale
him
in
this
manner
with
scrap
and
sour
wine
,
he
take
occasion
to
inquire
about
the
old
lady
and
her
daughter
,
before
whom
he
say
he
have
perform
in
his
last
peregrination
.
 
<EOS>
Tho
'
<EOS>
this
question
be
ask
with
all
that
air
of
simplicity
which
be
peculiar
to
these
people
,
one
of
the
domestic
take
the
alarm
,
be
infect
with
the
suspicion
of
his
master
,
and
plainly
tax
the
major
with
be
a
spy
,
threaten
at
the
same
time
that
he
should
be
strip
and
search
.
    
<EOS>
this
would
have
be
a
very
dangerous
experiment
for
the
Hibernian
,
who
have
actually
in
his
pocket
a
letter
to
the
countess
from
her
son
,
which
he
hope
fortune
may
have
furnish
him
with
an
opportunity
to
deliver
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
therefore
find
himself
in
this
dilemma
,
he
be
not
at
all
easy
in
his
own
mind
:
<EOS>
however
,
instead
of
protest
his
innocence
in
an
humble
and
beseech
strain
,
in
order
to
acquit
himself
of
the
charge
,
he
resolve
to
elude
the
suspicion
,
by
provoke
the
wrath
of
his
accuser
,
and
put
on
the
air
of
vulgar
integrity
affront
,
begin
to
reproach
the
servant
in
very
insolent
term
for
his
unfair
supposition
,
and
undress
himself
in
a
moment
to
the
skin
,
throw
his
tattere
garment
in
the
face
of
his
adversary
,
tell
him
he
would
find
nothing
there
which
he
would
not
be
very
glad
to
part
with
;
at
the
same
time
raise
his
voice
,
he
,
in
the
gibberish
of
the
clan
he
represent
,
scold
and
curse
with
great
fluency
:
so
that
the
whole
house
resound
with
the
noise
.
 
<EOS>
the
valet
's
jealousy
,
like
a
small
fire
,
be
in
a
trice
swallow
up
in
the
great
flame
of
his
rage
enkindle
by
this
abrupt
address
:
in
consequence
of
which
,
Farrel
be
kick
out
at
the
gate
,
naked
as
he
be
to
the
waist
,
after
his
lanthorn
have
be
break
to
piece
on
his
head
;
and
there
he
be
join
by
his
domestic
,
who
have
not
be
able
to
recover
his
apparel
and
effect
a
retreat
,
without
incur
mark
of
the
same
sort
of
distinction
.
    
<EOS>
the
major
,
consider
the
risk
he
must
have
run
in
be
detect
,
think
himself
cheaply
quit
for
this
moderate
discipline
,
though
he
be
really
concerned
for
his
friend
Renaldo
,
who
understand
the
particular
of
the
adventure
,
determine
,
as
the
last
effort
,
to
ride
round
the
castle
in
the
open
day
,
on
pretence
of
take
the
air
,
when
,
peradventure
,
the
countess
would
see
him
from
the
place
of
her
confinement
,
and
favour
him
with
some
mark
or
token
of
her
be
alive
.
    
<EOS>
though
his
companion
do
not
much
relish
this
plan
,
which
he
foresaw
would
expose
him
to
the
insult
of
Trebasi
;
yet
,
as
he
could
not
contrive
a
well
,
he
acquiesce
in
Renaldo
's
invention
,
with
the
proviso
,
that
he
would
defer
the
execution
of
it
until
his
father
in
-
law
should
be
absent
in
the
chace
,
which
be
a
diversion
he
every
day
enjoy
.
    
<EOS>
accordingly
they
set
a
proper
watch
,
and
lie
conceal
until
they
be
inform
of
<EOS>
Trebasi
's
have
go
forth
;
when
they
mount
their
horse
,
and
ride
unto
the
neighbourhood
of
the
castle
.
 
<EOS>
have
make
a
small
excursion
in
the
adjoin
field
,
they
draw
near
the
wall
and
at
an
easy
pace
have
twice
circle
them
,
when
Farrel
descry
at
the
top
of
a
tower
,
a
white
handkerchief
wave
by
a
woman
's
hand
thro
'
the
iron
bar
that
secure
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
this
signal
be
point
to
Renaldo
,
his
heart
begin
to
throb
with
great
violence
;
he
make
a
respectful
obeissance
towards
the
part
in
which
it
appear
,
and
perceive
the
hand
beckon
him
to
approach
,
advance
to
the
very
buttress
of
the
turret
;
upon
which
,
see
something
drop
,
he
alight
with
great
expedition
,
and
take
up
a
picture
of
his
father
in
miniature
,
the
feature
of
which
he
no
sooner
distinguish
,
than
the
tear
run
down
his
cheek
;
he
press
the
little
image
to
his
lip
with
the
most
filial
fervour
;
then
convey
it
to
his
bosom
,
look
up
to
the
hand
,
which
wave
in
such
a
manner
,
as
give
him
to
understand
it
be
high
time
to
retire
.
    
<EOS>
be
by
this
time
highly
persuade
that
his
kind
monitor
be
no
other
than
the
countess
herself
,
he
point
to
his
heart
,
in
token
of
his
filial
affection
,
and
lay
his
hand
on
his
sword
,
to
denote
his
resolution
of
do
her
justice
,
he
take
his
leave
with
another
profound
bow
,
and
suffer
himself
to
be
reconducte
to
his
lodging
.
    
<EOS>
every
cicumstance
of
this
transaction
be
observe
by
the
servant
of
count
Trebasi
,
who
immediately
dispatch
a
messenger
to
their
lord
,
with
an
account
of
what
have
happen
.
 
<EOS>
alarm
at
this
information
,
from
which
he
immediately
conclude
that
the
stranger
be
young
Melvile
<EOS>
,
he
forthwith
quit
the
chace
,
and
return
to
the
castle
by
a
private
postern
,
order
his
horse
to
be
keep
ready
saddle
,
in
hope
that
his
son
-
in
-
law
would
repeat
the
visit
to
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
this
precaution
would
have
be
to
no
purpose
,
have
Renaldo
follow
the
advice
of
Farrel
,
who
represent
the
danger
of
return
to
a
place
where
the
alarm
be
undoubtedly
give
by
his
first
appearance
;
and
exhort
him
to
return
to
Vienna
for
the
prosecution
of
his
suit
,
now
that
he
be
satisfied
of
his
mother
's
be
alive
;
in
order
to
strengthen
this
admonition
,
he
bid
him
recollect
the
signal
for
withdrawing
,
which
be
doubtless
the
effect
of
maternal
concern
,
inspire
by
the
knowledge
of
the
count
's
vigilance
and
vindictive
disposition
.
    
<EOS>
notwithstanding
these
suggestion
,
Melvile
persist
in
his
resolution
of
appear
once
more
below
the
tower
,
on
the
supposition
that
his
mother
,
in
expectation
of
his
return
,
have
prepare
a
billet
for
his
acceptance
,
from
which
he
may
obtain
important
intelligence
.
    
<EOS>
the
major
see
him
lend
a
deaf
ear
to
his
remonstrance
,
be
content
to
attend
him
in
this
second
expedition
,
which
he
press
him
to
undertake
that
same
afternoon
,
as
Trebasi
have
take
care
to
circulate
a
report
of
his
have
go
to
dine
at
the
seat
of
a
nobleman
in
the
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
Our
knight
-
errant
and
his
squire
,
deceive
by
this
finesse
,
present
themselves
again
under
the
prison
of
the
countess
,
who
no
sooner
beheld
her
son
return
than
she
earnestly
intreate
him
to
be
go
,
by
the
same
sign
which
she
have
before
use
;
and
he
take
it
for
grant
that
she
be
debar
the
use
of
pen
ink
and
paper
,
and
that
he
have
nothing
more
to
expect
,
<EOS>
consent
to
retire
,
and
have
already
move
to
some
distance
from
the
house
,
when
in
cross
a
small
plantation
that
belong
to
the
castle
,
they
be
meet
by
count
Trebasi
and
another
person
on
horseback
.
    
<EOS>
at
sight
of
this
apparition
,
the
blood
mount
into
Renaldo
's
cheek
,
and
his
eye
begin
to
lighten
with
eagerness
and
indignation
;
which
be
not
at
all
diminish
by
the
ferocious
address
of
the
count
,
who
,
advance
to
Melvile
,
with
a
menacing
air
,
"
before
you
proceed
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
must
know
with
what
view
you
have
be
twice
to
day
patrol
round
my
inclosure
,
and
reconnoitre
the
different
avenue
of
my
house
:
you
likewise
carry
on
a
clandestine
correspondence
with
some
person
in
the
family
,
of
which
my
honour
oblige
me
to
demand
an
explanation
.
<EOS>
"
    
"
have
your
action
be
always
regulate
by
the
dictate
of
honour

reply
Renaldo
,
I
should
never
have
be
question
for
ride
round
that
castle
which
you
know
be
my
rightful
inheritance
;
or
exclude
from
the
sight
of
a
parent
who
suffer
under
your
tyranny
and
oppression
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
my
part
,
therefore
,
to
expostulate
;
and
,
since
fortune
hath
favour
me
with
an
opportunity
of
revenge
our
wrong
in
person
,
we
shall
not
part
,
until
you
have
learn
that
the
family
of
the
count
de
Melvile
be
not
to
be
injure
with
impunity
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
no
advantage
on
either
side
,
in
point
of
arm
or
number
,
you
be
better
mount
than
I
be
,
and
shall
have
the
choice
of
the
ground
on
which
our
difference
ought
to
be
bring
to
a
speedy
determination
.
"
    
<EOS>
Trebasi
,
whose
courage
be
not
of
the
sentimental
kind
,
but
purely
owe
to
his
natural
insensibility
of
danger
,
instead
of
concert
measure
coolly
for
the
engagement
,
or
make
any
verbal
reply
to
this
defiance
,
draw
a
pistol
without
the
least
hesitation
,
and
fire
it
at
the
face
of
Renaldo
,
part
of
whose
left
eye

ball

<EOS>
Melvile
be
not
slow
in
return
the
compliment
,
which
,
as
it
be
deliberate
,
prove
the
more
decisive
:
for
the
shot
enter
the
count
's
right
breast
;
make
its
way
to
the
back
bone
with
such
a
shock
,
as
strike
him
to
the
ground
;
upon
which
the
other
alight
,
in
order
to
improve
the
advantage
he
have
gain
.
    
<EOS>
during
this
transaction
,
Farrel
have
well
nigh
lose
his
life
by
the
savage
behaviour
of
Trebasi
's
attendant
,
who
have
be
a
hussar
officer
,
and
who
think
it
be
his
duty
to
imitate
the
example
of
his
patron
on
this
occasion
,
discharge
a
pistol
at
the
major
before
he
have
the
least
intimation
of
his
design
.
    
<EOS>
the
Hibernian
's
horse
be
a
common
hireling
,
and
unaccustomed
to
stand
fire
,
no
sooner
see
the
flash
of
Trebasi

pistol
,
than
start
aside
,
he
happen
to
plunge
into
a
hole
,
and
be
overturn
at
the
very
instant
when

that
no
damage

to
his
rider

who
pitch
on
his
foot

fly
with
great
nimbleness
to
his
adversary

then
lay
hold
on
one
leg
,
dismount
him
in
a
twinkling
,
and
seize
his
throat
as
he
lie

would

soon
dispatch
him
without

have
he
not

prevent
by
his
friend
Renaldo

who
desire
him
to
desist
,
observe
that
his
vengeance
be
already
satisfied
,
as
the
count
seem
to
be
in
the
agony
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
the
major
be
loth
to
quit
his
prey
,
as
he
think
his
aggressor
have
act
in
a
treacherous
manner
;
but
recollect
that
there
be
no
time
to
lose
,
because
,
in
all
probality
,
the
firing
have
alarm
the
castle
,
he
take
his
leave
of
the
vanquish
hussar
,
with
a
couple
of
hearty
kick
,
and
mount
his
horse
,
follow
Melvile
to
the
house
of
a
gentleman
in
the
neighbourhood
,
who
be
kinsman
to
the
countess
,
and
very
well
disposed
to
grant
him
a
secure
retreat
,
until
the
troublesome
consequence
of
this
rencounter
should
be
overblow
.
    
<EOS>
Trebasi
,
though
to
the
young
gentleman
he
seem
speechless
and
insensible
,
have
neither
lose
the
use
of
his
reason
,
nor
of
his
tongue
,
but
affect
that
extremity
,
in
order
to
avoid
any
further
conversation
with
the
victor
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
one
of
those
people
who
never
think
of
death
until
he
knock
at
the
door
,
and
then
earnestly
intreat
him
to
excuse
them
for
the
present
,
and
be
so
good
as
to
call
another
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
count
have
so
often
escape
unhurt
,
in
the
course
of
his
campaign
,
that
he
look
upon
himself
as
invulnerable
,
and
set
all
danger
at
defiance
.
    
<EOS>
though
he
have
hitherto
take
no
care
of
the
concern
of
his
soul
,
he
have
a
large
fund
of
superstition
at
bottom
;
and
when
the
surgeon
who
examine
his
wound
,
declare
it
be
mortal
,
all
the
terror
of
futurity
take
hold
on
his
imagination
,
and
all
the
misdemeanour
of
his
life
present
themselves
in
aggravated
colour
to
his
recollection
.
    
<EOS>
He
implore
the
spiritual
assistance
of
a
good
priest
in
the
neighbourhood
,
who
,
in
the
discharge
of
his
own
conscience
,
give
him
to
understand
,
that
he
have
little
mercy
to
expect
,
unless
he
would
,
as
much
as
lie
in
his
power
,
redress
the
injury
he
have
do
to
his
fellow
creature
.
 
<EOS>
as
nothing
lie
heavier
upon
his
soul
than
the
cruelty
and
fraud
he
have
practise
upon
the
family
of
count
Melvile
,
he
earnestly
beseech
this
charitable
clergyman
to
mediate
his
pardon
with
the
countess
,
and
at
the
same
time
desire
to
see
Renaldo
before
his
death
,
that
he
may
put
him
in
possession
of
his
paternal
estate
,
and
sollicit
his
forgiveness
for
the
offence
he
have
give
.
    
<EOS>
His
lady
,
far
from
wait
for
the
priest
's
intercession
,
no
sooner
understand
the
lamentable
situation
of
her
husband
,
and
find
herself
at
liberty
,
than
she
hasten
to
his
apartment
,
express
the
utmost
concern
for
his
misfortune

and
tend
him
with
truly
conjugal
tenderness
and
fidelity

Her

gladly
obey
the
summon

be
receive
with
great
civility
and
satisfaction
by
his
father

who
,
in
presence
of
the

diver
gentleman
assemble
for
that
purpose

renounce
all
right

disclose
the

an
excess
of
joy
,
while
she
embrace
her
long
lose
son
,
who
have
prove
himself
so
worthy
of
his
father
.
 
<EOS>
yet
this
joy
be
imbittere
,
by
reflect
that
she
be
make
a
widow
by
the
hand
of
that
darle
son
:
for
,
though
she
know
his
honour
demand
the
sacrifice
,
she
could
not
lay
aside
that
regard
and
veneration
which
be
attach
to
the
name
of
husband
;
and
therefore
resolve
to
retire
into
a
monastry
,
where
she
could
spend
the
remainder
of
her
life
in
devotion
,
without
be
expose
to
any
intercourse
which
may
interfere
with
the
delicacy
of
her
sentiment
on
that
subject
.
     
<EOS>
He
be
the
messenger
of
happiness
to
his
sister
,
who
remove
the
film
which
have
long
obstruct
his
penetration
,
with
regard
to
count
Fathom
.
   
<EOS>
as
the
most
endearing
affection
have
always
subsist
between
Renaldo
and
his
sister
,
he
would
not
one
moment
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
fly
to
her
embrace
,
and
of
be
the
glad
messenger
of
her
deliverance
.
    
<EOS>
soon
,
therefore
,
as
he
understand
the
place
of
her
retreat
,
and
have
obtain
a
proper
order
to
the
abbess
,
sign
by
count
Trebasi
,
he
set
out
post
for
Vienna
,
still
accompany
by
his
faithful
Hibernian
,
and
arrive
at
the
convent
,
find
the
abbess
and
the
whole
house
so
engross
in
make
preparation
for
the
ceremony
of
give
the
veil
next
day
to
a
young
woman
who
have
fulfil
the
term
of
her
probation
,
that
he
could
not
possibly
see
his
sister
with
that
leisure
and
satisfaction
which
he
have
flatter
himself
with
enjoy
at
this
meeting
;
and
therefore
he
be
fain
to
bridle
his
impatience
for
two
day
,
and
keep
his
credential
until
the
hurry
should
be
over
,
that
mademoiselle
may
have
no
intimation
of
her
good
fortune
,
except
from
his
own
mouth
.
    
<EOS>
in
order
to
fill
up
this
tedious
interval
,
he
visit
his
friend
at
court
,
who
be
rejoice
to
hear
the
happy
issue
of
his
excursion
to
Presburg
;
the
prince
who
be
his
particular
patron
desire
he
would
make
himself
perfectly
easy
with
regard
to
the
death
of
count
Trebasi
,
for
he
would
take
care
to
represent
him
in
such
a
light
to
the
empress
queen
,
as
would
screen
him
from
any
danger
or
prosecution
on
that
account
.
 
<EOS>
His
Highness
,
moreover
,
appoint
the
follow
day
for
perform
the
promise
he
have
make
of
present
him
to
that
august
princess
,
and
in
the
mean
time
prepossess
her
so
much
in
his
favour
,
that
when
he
approach
her
presence
,
and
be
announce
by
his
noble
introductor
,
she
eye
him
with
a
look
of
peculiar
complacency
,
say
,
"
I
be
glad
to
see
you
return
to
my
dominion
.
 
<EOS>
Your
father
be
a
gallant
officer
,
who
serve
our
house
with
equal
courage
and
fidelity
;
and
as
I
understand
you
tread
in
his
foot
-
step
,
you
may
depend
upon
my
favour
and
protection
.
"
    
<EOS>
He
be
so
much
overwhelmed
with
this
gracious
reception
,
that
,
while
he
bow
in
silence
,
the
drop
of
gratitude
trickle
from
his
eye
;
and
her
imperial
majesty
be
so
well
pleased
with
this
manifestation
of
his
heart
,
that
she
immediately
give
direction
for
promote
him
to
the
command
of
a
troop
of
horse
.
      
<EOS>
Thus
fortune
seem
willing
,
and
indeed
eager
,
to
discharge
the
debt
she
owe
him
for
the
different
calamity
he
have
undergo
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
he
look
upon
the
generous
Hebrew
to
be
the
sole
source
of
his
success
,
he
do
not
fail
to
make
him
acquaint
with
the
happy
effect
of
his
recommendation
and
friendship
,
and
to
express
,
in
the
warm
term
,
the
deep
sense
he
have
of
his
uncommon
benevolence
,
which
,
by
the
bye
,
be
still
great
with
regard
to
Renaldo
,
than
the
reader
as
yet
imago
;
for
he
not
only
furnish
him
with
money
for
his
present
occasion
,
but
also
give
him
an
unlimited
credit
on
a
banker
in
Vienna
to
whom
one
of
his
letter
be
direct
.
    
<EOS>
the
ceremony
of
the
nun
's
admission
be
now
perform
,
and
the
convent
restore
to
its
former
quiet
,
Melvile
haste
thither
on
the
wing
of
brotherly
affection
,
and
present
his
letter
to
the
abbess
,
who
have
peruse
the
content
,
by
which
she
learn
that
the
family
disquiet
of
count
Trebasi
no
longer
subsist
,
and
that
the
bearer
be
the
brother
of
mademoiselle
,
she
receive
him
with
great
politeness
,
congratulate
him
on
this
happy
event
,
and
beg
he
would
excuse
her
stay
with
him
in
the
parlour
,
on
pretence
of
business
,
withdraw
,
say
,
she
would
immediately
send
in
a
young
lady
who
would
console
him
for
her
absence
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
he
be
join
by
his
sister
,
who
,
expect
nothing
less
than
to
see
Renaldo
,
no
sooner
distinguish
his
feature
,
than
<EOS>
she
shriek'd
<EOS>
aloud
with
surprize
,
and
would
have
sink
upon
the
floor
,
<EOS>
have
not
he
support
her
in
his
embrace
.
    
<EOS>
such
a
sudden
apparition
of
her
brother
at
any
time
,
or
in
any
place
<EOS>
,
after
their
long
separation
,
would
have
strongly
affect
this
sensible
young
lady
:
but
to
find
him
so
abruptly
in
a
place
where
she
think
herself
bury
from
the
knowledge
of
all
her
relation
,
occasion
such
commotion
in
her
spirit
as
have
well
nigh
endanger
her
reason
:
for
it
be
not
 
'
till
after
a
considerable
pause
,
that
she
could
talk
to
him
with
connexion
or
coherence
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
as
those
transport
subside
,
they
enter
into
a
more
deliberate
and
agreeable
conversation
;
in
the
course
of
which
,
he
gradually
inform
her
of
what
have
pass
at
the
castle
;
and
inexpressible
be
the
pleasure
she
feel
in
learn
that
her
mother
be
release
from
captivity
,
herself
restore
to
freedom
,
and
her
brother
to
the
possession
of
his
lawful
inheritance
,
by
the
only
mean
to
which
she
have
always
pray
these
blessing
may
be
owe
.
    
<EOS>
as
she
have
be
treat
with
uncommon
humanity
by
the
abbess
,
she
would
not
consent
to
leave
the
convent
until
he
should
be
ready
to
set
out
for
Presburg
;
so
that
they
dine
together
with
that
good
lady
,
and
pass
the
afternoon
in
that
mutual
communication
with
which
a
brother
and
sister
may
be
suppose
to
entertain
themselves
on
such
an
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
She
give
him
a
detail
of
the
insult
and
mortification
she
have
suffer
from
the
brutality
of
her
father
-
in
-
law
,
and
tell
him
,
that
her
confinement
in
this
monastry
be
owe
to
<EOS>
Trebasi
's
have
intercept
a
letter
to
her
from
Renaldo
,
signify
his
intention
to
return
to
the
empire
,
in
order
to
assert
his
own
right
and
redress
her
grievance
.
    
<EOS>
then
turn
the
discourse
upon
the
incident
of
his
peregrination
,
she
in
a
particular
manner
inquire
about
that
exquisite
beauty
who
have
be
the
innocent
source
of
all
his
distress
,
and
upon
whose
perfection
he
have
often
,
in
his
letter
to
his
sister
,
expatiate
with
expression
of
rapture
and
delight
.
    
<EOS>
this
inquiry
in
a
moment
blow
up
that
scorch
flame
which
have
be
well
nigh
stifle
by
other
necessary
avocation
.
 
<EOS>
His
eye
gleam
,
his
cheek
glow
and
grow
pale
alternately
,
and
his
whole
frame
undergo
an
immediate
agitation
;
which
be
perceive
by
mademoiselle
<EOS>
,
she
conclude
that
some
new
calamity
be
annex
to
the
name
of
Monimia
,
and
dread
to
ripe
up
a
wound
which
she
see
be
so
ineffectually
closed
,
she
for
the
present
suppress
her
curiosity
and
concern
,
and
industriously
endeavour
to
introduce
some
less
affect
subject
of
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
her
aim
,
approve
of
her
discretion
,
and
join
her
endeavour
,
express
his
surprize
at
her
have
omit
to
signify
the
least
remembrance
of
her
old
favourite
Fathom
,
whom
he
have
leave
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
sooner
pronounce
this
name
,
than
she
suffer
some
confusion
in
her
turn
;
from
which
,
however
,
recollect
herself
,
"
Brother
,
"
say
she
,
"
you
must
endeavour
to
forget
that
wretch
,
who
be
altogether
unworthy
of
retain
the
small
share
of
your
regard
.
"
    
<EOS>
Astonished
,
and
indeed
angry
at
this
expression
,
which
he
consider
as
the
effect
of
malicious
misrepresentation
,
he
gently
chide
her
for
her
credulity
in
believe
the
envious
aspersion
of
some
person
who
repine
at
the
superior
virtue
of
Fathom
,
whom
he
affirm
to
be
an
honour
to
the
human
specie
.
    
<EOS>
"
nothing
be
more
easy
,
"
reply
the
young
lady
,
"
than
to
impose
upon
a
person
,
who
,
be
himself
unconscious
of
guile
,
suspect
no
deceit
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
be
a
dupe
,
dear
brother
,
not
to
the
finesse
of
Fathom
,
but
to
the
sincerity
of
your
own
heart
.
 
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
assume
no
honour
to
my
own
penetration
in
have
comprehend
the
villainy
of
that
impostor
,
which
be
discover
in
more
than
one
instance
by
accident
I
could
not
possibly
foresee
.
"
    
<EOS>
You
must
know
that
Teresa
,
who
attend
me
from
my
childhood
,
and
in
whose
honesty
I
repose
such
confidence
,
have
disoblige
some
of
the
inferior
servant
,
be
so
narrowly
watch
in
all
her
transaction
,
as
to
be
at
last
detect
in
the
very
act
of
convey
a
peice
of
plate
,
which
be
actually
find
conceal
among
her
cloath
.
    
<EOS>
You
may
guess
how
much
I
be
astonish
when
I
understand
this
circumstance
;
I
could
not
trust
to
the
evidence
of
my
own
sense
,
and
should
have
still
believe
her
innocent
,
in
spite
of
ocular
demonstration
,
have
not
she
,
in
the
terror
of
be
try
for
felony
,
promise
to
make
a
very
material
discovery
to
the
countess
,
provide
she
would
take
such
measure
as
would
save
her
life
.
    
<EOS>
this
request
be
comply
with
,
she
,
in
my
hearing
,
open
up
such
an
amazing
scene
of
iniquity
,
baseness
and
ingratitude
,
which
have
be
act
by
her
and
Fathom
,
in
order
to
defraud
the
family
to
which
they
be
so
much
indebted
,
that
I
could
not
have
believe
the
human
mind
capable
of
such
degeneracy
,
or
that
traitor
endow
with
such
pernicious
cunning
and
dissimulation
,
have
not
her
tale
be
congruous
,
consistent
and
distinct
,
and
fraught
with
circumstance
that
leave
no
room
to
doubt
the
least
article
of
her
confession
:
on
consideration
of
which
,
she
be
permit
to
go
into
voluntary
exile
.
"
    
<EOS>
She
then
explain
their
combination
in
all
the
particular
,
as
we
have
already
recount
them
in
their
proper
place
;
and
,
finally
,
observe
,
that
the
opinion
she
have
hence
conceive
of
Fathom
's
character
,
be
confirm
by
what
she
have
since
learn
of
his
perfidious
conduct
towards
that
very
nun
who
have
lately
take
the
veil
.
    
<EOS>
perceive
<EOS>
her
brother
strike
dumb
with
astonishment
,
and
gape
with
the
most
eager
attention
,
she
proceed
to
relate
the
incident
of
his
double
intrigue
with
the
jeweller
's
wife
and
daughter
,
as
they
be
communicate
to
her
by
the
nun
,
who
be
no
other
than
the
individual
Wilhelmina
.
 
<EOS>
after
those
rival
have
be
forsake
by
their
gallant
,
their
mutual
animosity
and
chagrin
serve
to
whet
the
attention
and
invention
of
each
;
so
that
in
a
little
time
the
whole
mystery
stand
disclose
to
both
.
 
<EOS>
the
mother
have
discover
the
daughter
's
correspondence
with
Fathom
,
as
we
have
formerly
observe
,
by
mean
of
that
unfortunate
letter
which
he
unwittingly
commit
to
the
charge
of
the
old
beldame
;
and
as
soon
as
she
understand
he
be
without
the
reach
of
all
sollicitation
or
prosecution
,
impart
this
billet
to
her
husband
,
whose
fury
be
so
ungovernable
,
that
he
have
almost
sacrifice
Wilhelmina
with
his
own
hand
,
especially
when
terrify
by
his
threat
and
imprecation
<EOS>
,
she
own
that
she
have
bestow
the
chain
on
this
perfidious
lover
.
    
<EOS>
however
,
his
dreadful
purpose
be
prevent
,
partly
by
the
interposition
of
his
wife
,
whose
aim
be
not
the
death
but
immurement
of
his
daughter
,
and
partly
by
the
tear
and
supplication
of
the
young
gentlewoman
herself
,
who
protest
,
that
,
although
the
ceremony
of
the
church
have
not
be
perform
,
she
be
contract
to
Fathom
by
the
most
solemn
vow
,
to
witness
which
he
invoke
all
the
saint
in
Heaven
.
    
<EOS>
the
jeweller
,
upon
cool
consideration
,
be
unwilling
to
lose
the
least
spark
of
hope
that
glitter
among
the
ruin
of
his
despair
,
and
resist
all
the
importunity
of
his
wife
,
who
press
him
to
consult
the
welfare
of
his
daughter
's
soul
,
in
the
fond
expectation
of
find
some
expedient
to
lure
back
the
chain
<EOS>
and
it
be
possessor
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
Wilhelmina
be
daily
and
hourly
expose
to
the
mortifying
animadversion
of
her
mamma
,
who
,
with
all
the
insolence
of
virtue
,
incessantly
upbraid
her
with
the
backsliding
of
her
vicious
life
,
and
exhort
her
to
reformation
and
repentance
.
 
<EOS>
this
continual
triumph
last
for
many
month
,
till
at
length
a
quarrel
happen
between
the
mother
and
the
gossip
at
whose
house
she
use
to
give
the
rendezvous
to
her
admirer
,
that
incense
confidante
,
in
the
precipitation
of
her
anger
,
promulgate
the
history
of
those
secret
meeting
,
and
,
among
the
rest
,
her
interview
with
Fathom
be
bring
to
light
.
    
<EOS>
the
first
people
who
hear
news
of
this
sort
,
be
generally
those
to
whom
they
be
most
unwelcome
.
    
<EOS>
the
German
be
soon
apprise
of
his
wife
's
frailty
,
and
consider
the
two
female
of
his
house
as
a
couple
of
devil
incarnate
,
send
from
hell
to
exercise
his
patience
:
<EOS>
yet
,
in
the
midst
of
his
displeasure
,
he
find
matter
of
consolation
,
in
be
furnish
with
a
sufficient
reason
for
part
with
his
helpmate
,
who
have
for
many
year
keep
his
family
in
disquiet
.
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
,
without
hazard
a
personal
conference
,
send
proposal
to
her
by
a
friend
,
which
she
do
not
think
proper
to
reject
:
and
see
himself
restore
to
the
dominion
of
his
own
house
,
exert
his
sway
so
tyrannically
,
that
Wilhelmina
become
weary
of
her
life
,
and
have
recourse
to
the
comfort
of
religion
,
of
which
she
soon
become
enamoured
,
and
beg
her
father
's
permission
to
dedicate
the
rest
of
her
life
to
the
duty
of
devotion
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
accordingly
receive
in
this
convent
;
the
regulation
of
which
be
so
much
to
her
liking
,
that
she
perform
the
task
of
probation
with
pleasure
,
and
voluntarily
exclude
herself
from
the
vanity
of
this
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
here
she
have
contract
an
acquaintance
with
mademoiselle
de
Melvile
,
to
whom
she
communicate
her
complaint
of
Fathom
,
on
the
supposition
that
he
be
relate
to
the
count
,
as
he
himself
have
often
declare
.
    
<EOS>
while
the
young
lady
rehearse
the
particular
of
this
detail
,
Renaldo
sustain
a
strange
vicissitude
of
different
passion
.
 
<EOS>
Surprise
,
sorrow
,
fear
,
hope
and
indignation
raise
a
most
tumultuous
conflict
in
his
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
Monimia
rush
upon
his
imagination
in
the
character
of
innocence
betray
by
the
insinuation
of
treachery
.
 
<EOS>
He
with
horror
view
her
at
the
mercy
of
a
villain
,
who
have
break
all
the
tie
of
gratitude
and
honour
.
    
<EOS>
Affrighted
at
the
prospect
,
he
start
from
his
seat
,
exclaim
in
the
unconnected
strain
of
distraction
and
despair
:
 
<EOS>
"
have
I
then
nourish
a
serpent
in
my
bosom
!
    
<EOS>
have
I
listen
to
the
voice
of
a
traitor
who
hath
murder
my
peace
!
<EOS>
who
hath
tear
my
heartstring
asunder
,
and
perhaps
ruin
the
pattern
of
all
earthly
perfection
.
 
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
would
not
suffer
such
infernal
artifice
to
take
effect
.
 
<EOS>
the
thunder
would
be
level
against
the
head
of
the
accurse
projector
.
"
    
<EOS>
from
this
transport
,
compare
with
his
agitation
when
she
mention
Monimia
,
his
sister
judge
that
Fathom
have
be
the
occasion
of
a
breach
between
the
two
lover
;
and
this
conjecture
be
confirm
by
the
disjoint
answer
he
make
to
her
interrogation
upon
the
affair
,
she
endeavour
to
calm
his
apprehension
,
by
represent
that
he
would
soon
have
an
opportunity
of
return
to
England
,
where
the
mis
-
understanding
may
be
easily
clear
up
;
and
that
,
in
the
mean
time
,
he
have
nothing
to
fear
on
account
of
the
person
of
his
mistress
,
in
a
country
where
individual
be
so
well
protect
by
the
law
and
constitution
of
the
realm
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
he
suffer
himself
to
be
flatter
with
the
fond
hope
of
see
Monimia
's
character
triumph
in
the
inquiry
;
of
retrieve
that
lose
jewel
,
and
of
renew
that
ravish
intercourse
and
exalt
expectation
which
have
be
so
cruelly
cut
off
.
 
<EOS>
He
now
wish
to
find
Fathom
as
black
as
he
have
be
exhibit
,
that
Monimia
's
apostacy
may
be
number
among
the
misrepresentation
of
his
treachery
and
fraud
.
    
<EOS>
His
love
,
which
be
alike
generous
and
ardent
,
espouse
the
cause
,
and
he
no
longer
doubt
her
constancy
and
virtue
:
but
when
he
reflect
how
her
tender
heart
must
have
be
wring
with
anguish
at
his
unkindness
and
cruelty
,
in
leave
her
destitute
in
a
foreign
land
;
how
her
sensibility
must
have
be
torture
in
find
herself
altogether
dependent
upon
a
ruffian
,
who
certainly
harbour
the
most
baleful
design
upon
her
honour
;
how
her
life
must
be
endanger
both
by
his
barbarity
and
her
own
despair
:
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
when
he
reflect
on
these
circumstance
,
he
shudder
with
horror
and
dismay
:
and
that
very
night
dispatch
a
letter
to
his
friend
the
Jew
,
intreate
him
,
in
the
most
pressing
manner
,
to
employ
all
his
intelligence
in
learn
the
situation
of
the
fair
orphan
,
that
she
may
be
protect
from
the
villainy
of
Fathom
,
until
his
return
to
England
.
     
<EOS>
He
recompense
the
attachment
of
his
friend
:
aud
receive
a
letter
that
reduce
him
to
the
verge
of
death
and
distraction
.
   
<EOS>
this
step
be
take
,
his
mind
in
some
measure
retrieve
its
former
tranquillity
:
he
soothe
himself
with
the
prospect
of
an
happy
reconciliation
with
the
divine
Monimia
,
and
his
fancy
be
decoy
from
every
disagreeable
presage
by
the
entertaining
conversation
of
his
sister
,
with
whom
in
two
day
he
set
out
for
Presburg
,
attend
by
his
friend
the
major
,
who
have
never
quit
him
since
their
meeting
at
Brussels
.
    
<EOS>
here
they
find
Count
Trebasi
entirely
rid
of
the
fever
which
have
be
occasion
by
his
wound
,
and
in
a
fair
way
of
do
well
;
a
circumstance
that
afford
unspeakable
pleasure
to
Melvile
,
whose
manner
of
thinking
be
such
,
as
would
have
make
him
unhappy
,
could
he
have
charge
himself
with
the
death
of
his
mother
's
husband
,
howsoever
criminal
he
may
have
be
.
    
<EOS>
the
count
's
ferocity
do
not
return
with
his
health
:
his
eye
be
open
by
the
danger
he
have
incur
,
and
his
sentiment
turn
in
a
new
channel
:
he
heartily
ask
pardon
of
mademoiselle
for
the
rigorous
useage
she
have
suffer
from
the
violence
of
his
temper
;
thank
Renaldo
for
the
seasonable
lesson
he
have
administer
to
him
;
and
not
only
insist
upon
be
remove
from
the
castle
to
an
house
of
his
own
in
Presburg
,
but
proffer
to
make
immediate
restitution
of
all
the
rent
which
he
unjustly
convert
to
his
own
use
.
    
<EOS>
these
thing
be
settle
in
the
most
amicable
manner
,
to
the
entire
satisfaction
of
the
party
concern
,
as
well
as
of
the
neighbour
noblesse
,
among
whom
the
house
of
Melvile
be
in
universal
esteem
,
Renaldo
resolve
to
sollicit
leave
at
the
imperial
court
to
return
to
England
,
in
order
to
investigate
the
affair
of
Monimia
,
which
be
more
interesting
than
all
the
point
he
have
hitherto
adjust
:
but
before
he
quit
Presburg
,
his
friend
Farrel
take
him
aside
one
day
,
"
Count
,
"
say
he
,
"
will
you
give
me
leave
to
ask
,
if
,
by
my
zeal
and
attachment
for
you
,
I
have
have
the
good
fortune
to
acquire
your
esteem
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
to
doubt
that
esteem
,
"
reply
Renaldo
,
"
be
to
suspect
my
gratitude
and
honour
,
of
which
I
must
be
utterly
destitute
before
I
lose
the
sense
of
those
obligation
I
owe
to
your
gallantry
and
friendship
:
obligation
which
I
long
for
a
proper
occasion
to
repay
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
well
then
,
"
resume
the
major
,
"
I
will
deal
with
you
like
a
downright
swiss
,
and
point
out
a
method
by
which
you
may
shift
the
load
of
obligation
from
your
own
shoulder
to
mine
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
my
birth
,
rank
and
expectation
in
the
service
:
<EOS>
but
perhaps
you
do
not
know
,
that
,
as
my
expence
hath
always
unavoidably
exceed
my
income
,
I
find
myself
a
little
out
at
elbow
in
my
circumstance
,
and
want
to
piece
them
up
by
matrimony
.
 
<EOS>
of
those
lady
with
whom
I
think
I
have
any
chance
of
succeed
,
mademoiselle
de
Melvile
seem
the
good
qualified
to
render
my
situation
happy
in
all
respect
.
 
<EOS>
Her
fortune
be
more
than
sufficient
to
disembarrass
my
affair
:
her
good
sense
will
be
a
seasonable
check
upon
my
vivacity
;
her
agreeable
accomplishment
will
engage
a
continuation
of
affection
and
regard
:
 
I
know
my
own
disposition
well
enough
to
think
I
shall
become
a
most
dutiful
and
tractable
husband
;
and
shall
deem
myself
highly
honour
in
be
more
closely
united
to
my
dear
count
de
Melvile
,
the
son
and
representative
of
that
worthy
officer
under
whom
my
youth
be
form
:
if
you
will
therefore
sanction
my
claim
,
I
will
forthwith
begin
my
approach
,
and
doubt
not
,
under
your
auspex
,
to
bring
the
place
to
a
capitulation
.
"
    
<EOS>
Renaldo
be
pleased
with
the
frankness
of
this
declaration
,
approve
of
his
demand
,
and
desire
him
to
depend
upon
his
good
office
with
his
sister
,
whom
he
sound
,
that
same
evening
,
upon
the
subject
,
recommend
the
major
to
her
favour
,
as
a
gentleman
well
worthy
of
her
choice
.
    
<EOS>
Mademoiselle

who
have
never

exercise
in
the
coquetry
of
her
sex
,
and
be
now
arrive
at
those
year
,
when
the
vanity
of
youth
ought
to
yield
to
discretion
,
consider
the
proposal
as
a
philosopher
,
and
after
due
deliberation

candidly
own

have
no

to
the
match

<EOS>
Farrel
be

character
of
a

,
after
the
permission
of
the
countess
have
be

;
and
he
carry
on
his
address
in
the
usual
form
,
so
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
concern
in

that
a
day
be

for
the
celebration
of
his
nuptial
,
when
he
enter
into
peaceable
possession
of
his
prize

<EOS>
a
few
day
after
this
joyful
occasion
,
while
Renaldo
be
at
Vienna
,
where
he
have
be
indulge
with
leave
of
absence
for
six
month

one
evening
present

by
his
servant
,
with
a
pacquet
from
London
,
which
he
no
sooner
open
,
than
he
find
inclose
a
letter
direct
to
him
,
in
the
hand
writing
of
Monimia
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
so
much
affect
at
sight
of
those
well
-
know
character
,
that
he
stand
motionless
as
a
statue
,
eager
to
know
the
content
,
yet
afraid
to
peruse
the
billet
.
 
<EOS>
while
he
hesitate
in
this
suspence
,
he
chance
to
cast
his
eye
on
the
inside
of
the
cover
,
and
perceive
the
name
of
his
jewish
friend
at
the
bottom
of
a
few
line
,
import
,
that
the
inclose
be
deliver
to
him
by
a
physician
of
his
acquaintance
,
who
have
recommend
it
in
a
particular
manner
to
his
care
.
    
<EOS>
this
intimation
serve
only
to
encrease
the
mystery
,
and
whet
his
impatience
;
and
as
he
have
the
explanation
in
his
hand
,
he
summon
all
his
resolution
to
his
aid
,
and
break
the
seal
,
begin
to
read
these
word
,
"
Renaldo
will
not
suppose
,
that
this
address
proceed
from
interested
motive
,
when
he
learn
,
that
,
before
it
can
be
present
to
his
view
,
the
unfortunate
Monimia
will
be
no
more
.
"
    
<EOS>
here
the
light
forsook
Renaldo
's
eye
,
his
knee
knock
together
,
and
he
fall
at
full
length
insensible
on
the
floor
:
his
valet
hear
the
noise
,
run
into
the
apartment
,
lift
him
upon
a
couch
,
and
dispatch
a
messenger
for
proper
assistance
,
while
he
himself
endeavour
to
recall
his
spirit
by
such
application
as
chance
afford
:
but
before
the
count
exhibit
any
sign
of
life
,
his
brother
-
in
-
law
enter
his
chamber
by
accident
,
and
as
soon
as
he
recollect
himself
from
the
extreme
confusion
and
concern
produce
by
this
melancholy
spectacle
,
he
perceive
the
fatal
epistle
<EOS>
which
Melvile
,
though
insensible
,
still
keep
within
his
grasp
;
justly
suspect
this
to
be
the
cause
of
that
severe
paroxysm
,
he
draw
near
the
couch
,
and
with
difficulty
read
what
be
above
rehearse
,
and
the
sequel
,
to
this
effect
.
    
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
have
take
such
measure
as
will
prevent
it
from
fall
into
your
hand
,
until
after
I
shall
have
be
release
from
a
be
imbittere
with
inexpressible
misery
and
anguish
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
my
intention
,
once
love
,
and
ah
!
<EOS>
still
too
fondly
remember
youth
,
to
upbraid
you
as
the
source
of
that
uncease
woe
,
which
have
be
so
long
the
sole
inhabitant
of
my
lonely
bosom

<EOS>
I
will
not
call
you
inconstant
or
unkind
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
not
think
you
base
or
dishonourable
;
yet
I
be
abruptly
sacrifice
to
a
triumphant
rival
,
before
I
have
learn
to
bear
such
mortification
;
before
I
have
overcome
the
prejudice
which
I
have
imbibe
in
my
father
's
house
.
    
<EOS>
I
be
all
at
once
abandon
to
despair
,
to
indigence
and
distress
,
to
the
vile
practice
of
a
villain
,
who
,
I
fear
,
hath
betray
us
both
.
 
<EOS>
what
have
not
I
suffer
from
the
insult
and
vicious
design
of
that
wretch
,
whom
you
cherish
in
your
bosom

<EOS>
yet
to
these
I
owe
this
near
approach
to
that
goal
of
peace
,
where
the
canker

worm
of
sorrow
will
expire

<EOS>
Beware
of
that
artful
traitor
;
and
,
oh
!
<EOS>
endeavour
to
overcome
that
levity
of
disposition
,
which
,
if
indulge
,
will
not
only
stain
your
reputation
,
but
also
debauch
the
good
quality
of
your
heart

<EOS>
I
release
you
,
in
the
sight
of
heaven
,
from
all
obligation
:
if
I
have
be
injure
,
let
not
my
wrong

visit
on
the
head
of
Renaldo
,
for
whom
shall
be
offer
up
the
last
fervent
prayer
of
the
hapless
Monimia
.
"
    
<EOS>
this
letter
be
a
clue
to
the
labyrinth
of
Melvile
's
distress
:
though
the
major
have
never
hear
him
mention
the
name
of
this
beauty
,
he
have
receive
such
hint
from
his
own
wife
,
as
enable
him
to
comprehend
the
whole
of
the
count
's
disaster
.
 
<EOS>
by
the
administration
of
stimulate
medicine
,
Renaldo
recover
his
perception
:
but
this
be
a
cruel
alternative
,
consider
the
situation
of
his
thought
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
word
he
pronounce
be
Monimia
,
with
all
the
emphasis
of
the
most
violent
despair
;
he
peruse
the
letter
,
and
pour
forth
incoherent
execration
against
Fathom
and
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
exclaim
in
a
frantic
tone
,
"
she
be
lose
for
ever
!
<EOS>
murthere
by
my
unkindness
!
<EOS>
we
be
both
undo

infernal
art
of
Fathom

<EOS>
execrable
monster

<EOS>
restore
her
to
my
arm
.
 
<EOS>
if
thou
be
not
a
fiend
in
reality
,
I
will
tear
out
thy
false
heart
!
"
    
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
spring
upon
his
valet
,
who
would
have
fall
a
sacrifice
to
his
undistinguishing
fury
,
have
not
he
be
save
by
the
interposition
of
Farrel
and
the
family
,
who
disengage
him
from
his
master
's
gripe
by
dint
of
force
;
yet
,
notwithstanding
their
joint
endeavour
<EOS>
,
he
break
from
this
restraint
,
leap
upon
the
floor
,
and
seize
his
sword
,
attempt
to
plunge
it
in
his
own
breast
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
once
more
overcome
by
number
,
he
curse
himself
,
and
all
those
who
with
-
hold
him
;
swear
he
would
not
survive
the
fair
victim
who
have
perish
by
his
credulity
and
indiscretion
;
and
the
agitation
of
his
spirit
increase
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
be
seize
with
strong
convulsion
,
which
nature
be
scarce
able
to
sustain
:
every
medical
expedient
be
use
to
quiet
this
perturbation
,
which
at
length
yield
so
far
as
to
subside
into
a
continual
fever
,
and
confirm
delirium
,
during
which
he
cease
not
to
pour
forth
the
most
pathetic
complaint
touch
his
ruin
love

and
to
rave
about
the
ill
star
Monimia
.
 
<EOS>
the
major
,
half
distract
by
the
calamity
of
his
friend
,
would
have
conceal
it
from
the
knowledge
of
his
family
,
have
not
the
physician
,
by
despair
of
his
life
,
lay
him
under
the
necessity
of
make
them
acquaint
with
his
condition
.
    
<EOS>
the
countess
and
Mrs
Farrel
be
no
sooner
informed
of
his
case
,
than
they
haste
to
the
melancholy
scene
,
where
they
find
Renaldo
deprive
of
his
sense
,
pant
under
the
rage
of
an
exasperate
disease
.
 
<EOS>
They
see
his
face
distort
,
and
his
eye
glare
with
frenzy
;
they
hear
him
invoke
the
name
of
Monimia
,
with
a
tenderness
of
accent
,
which
even
the
impulse
of
madness
could
not
destroy
.
    
<EOS>
then
with
a
sudden
transition
of
tone
and
gesture
,
he
denounce
vengeance
against
her
betrayer
,
and
call
upon
the
north
wind
to
cool
the
fervour
of
his
brain
.
 
<EOS>
His
hair
hang
in
dishevelled
parcel
,
his
cheek
be
wan
,
his
look
ghastly
,
his
vigour
be
flee
,
and
all
the
glory
of
his
youth
fade
;
the
physician
hang
his
head
in
silence
,
the
attendant
wring
their
hand
in
despair
,
and
the
countenance
of
his
friend
be
bathe
in
tear
.
    
<EOS>
such
a
picture
would
have
move
the
most
obdurate
heart
;
what
impression
then
must
it
have
make
upon
a
parent
and
sister
,
melt
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
affection
!
 
<EOS>
the
mother
be
strike
dumb
,
and
stupifie
with
grief
;
the
sister
throw
herself
on
the
bed
in
a
transport
of
sorrow
,
catch
her
love
Renaldo
in
her
arm
,
and
be
,
with
great
difficulty
,
tear
from
his
embrace
.
 
<EOS>
such
be
the
dismal
reverse
that
overtook
the
late
so
happy
family
of
Melvile
;
such
be
the
extremity
to
which
the
treachery
of
Fathom
have
reduce
his
good
benefactor
!
    
<EOS>
three
day
do
nature
struggle
with
surprising
effort
,
and
then
the
constitution
seem
to
sink
under
the
victorious
fever
;
yet
,
as
his
strength
diminish
,
his
delirium
abate
,
and
on
the
fifth
morning
he
look
round
,
and
recognize
his
weeping
friend
.
    
<EOS>
Though
now
exhaust
to
the
low
ebb
of
life
,
he
retain
the
perfect
use
of
speech
,
and
his
reason
be
quite
unclouded
,
speak
to
each
with
equal
kindness
and
composure
;
he
congratulate
himself
upon
the
sight
of
shore
,
after
the
horror
of
such
a
temp
;
call
upon
the
countess
and
his
sister
,
who
be
not
permit
to
see
him
at
such
a
conjuncture
,
and
be
apprize
by
the
major
,
of
his
reason
for
exclude
them
from
his
presence
,
he
applaud
his
concern
,
bequeath
them
to
his
future
care
,
and
take
leave
of
that
gentleman
with
a
cordial
embrace
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
desire
to
be
leave
in
private
with
a
certain
clergyman
,
who
regulate
the
concern
of
his
soul
;
and
he
be
dismiss
,
turn
his
face
from
the
light
,
in
expectation
of
his
final
discharge
:
in
a
few
minute
all
be
still
and
dreary
;
he
be
no
longer
hear
to
breathe
,
no
more
the
stream
of
life
be
perceive
to
circulate
;
he
be
suppose
to
be
absolve
from
all
his
care
,
and
an
universal
groan
from
the
by
-
stander
anounce
the
decease
of
the
gallant
,
generous
,
and
tender
hearte
Renaldo

<EOS>
"
come
hither
ye
,
whom
the
pride
of
youth
and
health

of

behold
how
low
this
excellent
young

<EOS>
mow
down
even
in

,
when
fortune
seem
to
open
all
her
treasure
to
his
worth

"
    
<EOS>
such
be
the
reflection
of
the
generous
Farrel
,
who
,
while
he
perform
the
last
office
of
friendship
,
inclose
the
eye
of
the
much
-
lament
Melvile
,
perceive
a
warmth
on
the
skin
,
which
the
hand
of
death
seldom
leave
unextinguished
:
this
uncommon
sensation
he
report
to
the
physician
,
who
,
tho
'
he
could
feel
no
pulsation
in
the
heart
or
artery
,
conjecture
,
that
life
still
linger
in
some
of
its
interior
haunt
,
and
immediately
order
such
application
to
the
extremity
and
surface
of
the
body
,
as
may
help
to
concentrate
and
reinforce
the
natural
heat
.
    
<EOS>
by
these
prescription
,
which
,
for
some
time
,
produce
no
sensible
effect
,
the
ember
be
,
in
all
probability
,
keep
glow
,
and
the
vital
power
revive
;
for
,
after
a
considerable
pause
,
respiration
be
gradually
renew
at
long
interval
,
a
languid
motion
be
perceive
at
the
heart
,
a
few
feeble
and
irregular
pulsation
be
feel
at
the
wrist
;
the
clay
-
coloured
livery
of
death
begin
to
vanish
from
his
face
;
the
circulation
acquire
new
force
,
and
he
open
his
eye
with
a
sigh
,
which
proclaim
his
return
from
the
shade
of
death
.
    
<EOS>
when
he
recover
the
faculty
of
swallow
,
a
cordial
be
administer
;
and
whether
the
fever

in
consequence
of
the

cool
and

in
that
agony

prepare
a
proper
channel
for
the
expulsion
of
the
disease

certain
it
be
,
he
be
,
from
this
moment
,
rid
of
all
bodily
pain
,
he
retrieve
the
animal
function
,
and
nothing
remain
of
his
malady
but
an
extreme
weakness
and
languor
,
the
effect
of
nature

be
fatigue
in
the
battle
she
have
win
.
    
<EOS>
Unutterable
be
the
joy
that
take
possession
of
his
mother
and
sister
,
when
Farrel
fly
into
their
apartment
,
to
intimate
this
happy
turn

<EOS>
Scarce
could
they
be
restrain
from
pour
forth
their
transport
in
the
presence
of
Renaldo
,
who
be
still
too
feeble
to
endure
such
communication
;
indeed
he
be
extremely
mortified
and
deject
at
this
event
,
which
have
diffuse
such
pleasure
and
satisfaction
among
his
friend

for
tho

his
distemper

the
fatal
cause
of
it
still

at

and
he
consider
this
respite
from

as
a
protraction
of
his
misery

<EOS>
when
he
be
congratulate
by
the
major
,
on
the
triumph
of
his

he
reply
,
with
a
groan
,
"

"
    
<EOS>
with
these
last
word
,
the
fire
dart
from
his

,
and
his
brother
,
snatch
this
occasional
handle
for
reconcile
him
to
life
,
join
in
his
exclamation
against
the
treacherous
Fathom
,
and
observe
,
that
he
should
not
,
in
point
of
honour
,
wish
to
die
,
until
he
should
have
sacrifice
that
traitor
to
the
mane
of
the
beauteous
Monimia
.
 
<EOS>
this
incitement
act
as
a
spur
upon
exhaust
nature
,
cause
the
blood
to
circulate
with
fresh
vigour
,
and
encourage
him
to
take
such
sustenance
as
would
recruit
his
strength
,
and
repair
the
damage
which
his
health
have
sustain
.
    
<EOS>
His
sister
assiduously
attend
him
in
his
recovery
,
flatter
his
appetite
,
and
amuse
his
sorrow
at
the
same
time
;
the
clergyman
assail
his
despondence
with
religious
weapon
,
as
well
as
with
argument
draw
from
philosophy
;
and
the
fury
of
his
passion
be
already
expend
,
he
become
so
tractable
as
to
listen
to
his
remonstrance
:
<EOS>
but
notwithstanding
the
joint
endeavour
of
all
his
friend
,
a
deep
-
fix
melancholy
remain
,
after
every
consequence
of
his
disease
have
vanish
:
in
vain
they
assay
to
elude
his
grief
by
gaiety
and
diversion
;
in
vain
they
try
to
decoy
his
heart
into
some
new
engagement
.
    
<EOS>
these
kind
attempt
serve
only
to
feed
and
nourish
that
melancholy
which
pine
within
his
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
Monimia
still
haunt
him
in
the
midst
of
these
amusement
,
while
his
reflection
whisper
to
him
,
"
pleasure
like
these
I
may
have
relish
with
her
participation

"
 
<EOS>
that
darle
idea
mingle
in
all
the
female
assembly
at
which
he
be
present
,
eclipse
their
attraction
,
and
inhance
the
bitterness
of
his
loss
;
for
absence
,
enthusiasm
,
and
even
his
despair
have
heighten
the
charm
of
the
fair
orphan
into
something
supernatural
and
divine
.
    
<EOS>
Time
,
that
commonly
weaken
the
trace
of
remembrance
,
seem
to
deepen
its
impression
in
his
breast
:
nightly
,
in
his
dream
,
do
he
converse
with
his
dear
Monimia
:
sometimes
on
the
verdant
bank
of
a
delightful
stream
,
where
he
breathe
,
in
soft
murmur
,
the
dictate
of
his
love
and
admiration
:
sometimes
recline
within
the
tufte
grove
,
his
arm
encircle
and
sustain
her
snowy
neck
,
<EOS>
whilst
she
,
with
look
of
love
ineffable
,
gaze
on
his
face
,
invoke
heaven
to
bless
her
husband
and
her
lord
:
yet
,
even
in
these
illusion
,
be
his
fancy
oft
alarm
for
the
ill
-
fate
fair
:
sometimes
he
view
her
tottering
on
the
brink
of
a
steep
precipice
,
far
distant
from
his
help
hand
:
at
other
time
she
seem
to
sail
along
the
boisterous
tide
,
implore
his
assistance
:
then
would
he
start
with
horror
from
his
sleep
,
and
feel
his
sorrow
more
than
realize
:
he
desert
his
couch
:
<EOS>
he
avoid
the
society
of
mankind
:
he
court
sequestered
shade
,
where
he
could
indulge
his
melancholy
;
there
his
mind
brood
over
his
calamity
,
until
his
imagination
become
familiar
with
all
the
ravage
of
death
:
it
contemplate
the
gradual
decline
of
Monimia
's
health
;
her
tear
,
her
distress
,
her
despair
at
his
imagined
cruelty
;
he
see
thro
'
that
perspective
,
every
blossom
of
her
beauty
wither
,
every
sparkle
vanish
from
her
eye
:
he
behold
her
fade
lip
,
her
pale
cheek
,
and
her
inanimated
feature
,
the
symmetry
of
which
not
death
itself
be
able
to
destroy
.
 
<EOS>
His
fancy
convey
her
breathless
corse
to
the
cold
grave
,
o'er
which
,
perhaps
,
no
tear
humane
be
shed
,
where
her
delicate
limb
be
consign
to
dust
,
where
she
be
dish
out
a
delicious
banquet
to
the
unsparing
worm
.
    
<EOS>
O'er
<EOS>
these
picture
he
dwell
with
a
sort
of
pleasing
anguish
,
until
he
become
so
enamoured
of
her
tomb
,
that
he
could
no
longer
resist
the
desire
which
compel
him
to
make
a
pilgrimage
to
the
dear
hallowed
spot
,
where
all
his
once
gay
hope
lie
bury
;
that
he
may
nightly
visit
the
silent
habitation
of
his
ruin
love
,
embrace
the
sacred
earth
with
which
she
be
now
compound
,
moisten
it
with
his
tear
,
and
bid
the
turf
lie
easy
on
her
breast
.
 
<EOS>
besides
the
prospect
of
this
gloomy
enjoyment
,
he
be
urge
to
return
to
England
,
by
an
eager
desire
of
take
vengeance
on
the
perfidious
Fathom
,
as
well
as
of
acquit
himself
of
the
obligation
he
owe
in
that
kingdom
,
to
those
who
have
assist
him
in
his
distress

He
therefore
communicate
his
intention
to

he
take

oppose
his

the
execution
of
which

they
justly

and
now
,
see
him
determine
,
they
shed
a
flood
of
tear
at
his
departure
,
and
he
set
out
from
Vienna
in
a
post
chaise

accompany
by
a
trusty

on

Renaldo

well
qualified
for

without

He

in

that

eclipse
by

unfortunate
interposition

his
terrene
part

putrifie

a

<EOS>
at
mention
of
this
detest
name

Renaldo

heart
begin
to
throb
with
indignation
;

he
suppress
the
emotion

desire
to
know
the
meaning
of
that
splendid
encomium
which
he
have
bestow
upon
his
confederate

"
It
would
be
quite
unnecessary

reply
Ratchkali

for
a
man
in
my
present
situation

the
truth

perfectly
well
know

I
be
condemn

hard
labour
for
life

unless
some
lucky
accident
(
which
I
can
not

shall
intervene

all
I
can
expect
be
some
alleviation
of
my
hard
lot
from
the
generosity
of
such
gentleman

you
who
compassionate
the
suffering

shall
(

concern
my
old
acquaintance
Ferdinand
Count
Fathom

real
character
hath
perhaps
hitherto
escape
your
notice

<EOS>
then
he
proceed
to
give
a
regular
detail
of
all
the
stroke
of
finesse
which
he
,
in
conjunction
with
our
adventurer
,
have
practise
upon
Melvile
and
other
,
during
their
residence
at
Vienna
,
and
the
campaign
they
have
make
upon
the
Rhine
:
he
explain
the
nature
of
the
robbery
which
be
suppose
to
have
be
do
by
the
count
's
valet
,
together
with
the
manner
of
their
desertion

he
describe
his
separation
from
Fathom

their
meeting
at
London
,
the
traffic
they
carry
on
in
copartnership

and
the
misfortune
that
reduce
Ferdinand
to
the
condition
in
which
he

find
by
Melvile

"
after

in
the
gaiety
of

place

exercise
our
talent

there

with

eagerness

but
,
chance
to
meet
with
an
old
acquaintance
,
whom
I
do
not
at
all
desire
to
see
<EOS>
,
I
find
it
convenient
to
withdraw
softly
to
Rotterdam
;
from
whence
we
set
out
for
Antwerp
;
and
have
make
a
tour
of
the
Austrian
Nether

set
up

from
our
appearance
we
procure
admission
into

most
polite

to
a
wonder

the

arrest

out
so
little

give

have
arrive

likely
to

peregrination

deign
to

his

"
    
<EOS>
Renaldo
have
no
reason
to
doubt
the
truth
of
this
story
,
every
circumstance
of
which
tend
to
corroborate
the
intelligence
he
have
already
receive
touch
the
character
of
Fathom

whom
he
now
consider
with
a
double
portion
of
abhorrence
,
as
the
most
abandon
miscreant
that
nature
have
ever
produce

<EOS>
Though
Ratchkali
do
not
possess
a
much
high
place
in
his
opinion
,
he
favour
him
with
mark
of
his
bounty
,
and
exhort
him
,
if
possible
,
to
reform
his
heart
;
but
he
would
by
no
means
promise
to
interpose
his
credit
in
favour
of
a
wretch
self
-
convict
of
such
enormous
villainy
and
fraud

<EOS>
He
could
not
help
moralize
upon
this
rencounter
,
which
inspire
him
with
great
contempt
for
human
nature
:
and
next
day
he
proceed
on
his
journey
with
a
heavy
heart
,
ruminate
on
the
perfidy
of
mankind
,
and
,
between
while
,
transport
with
the
prospect
of
revenge
all
his
calamity
upon
the
accurse
author

<EOS>
while
he
be
wrap
up
in
these
reverie
,
his
carriage
roll
along
,
and
have
already
enter
a
wood
between
Mons

when
his
dream
be
suddenly
interrupt
by
the
explosion
of
several
pistol
that
be
fire
among
the
thicket
at
a
little
distance
from
the
road

<EOS>
rouse
at
this
alarm
,
he
snatch
his
sword
that
stand
by
him
,
and
spring
from
the
chaise
,
run
directly
towards
the
spot
,
be
close
follow
by
his
valet
,
who
have
alight
and
arm
himself
with
a
pistol
in
each
hand
.
 
<EOS>
about
forty
yard
from
the
high
way
they
arrive
in
a
little
glade
or
opening
,
where
they
see
a
single
man
stand
at
bay
against
five
bandit
,
after
have
kill
one
of
their
companion
,
and
lose
his
own
horse
that
lie
dead
upon
the
ground
.
    
<EOS>
Melvile
see
this
odd
,
and
immediately
guess
their
design
,
rush
among
them
without
hesitation
,
and
in
an
instant
run
his
sword
through
the
heart
of
one
whose
hand
be
raise
to
smite
the
gentleman
behind
,

rest
in

<EOS>
at
the

time
the
valet
disable
another
by
a
shot
in
the
shoulder
;
so
that
the
number
be
now
equal
on
both
side
,
a
furious
combat
ensue
,
every
man
be
pair
with
an
antagonist
,
and
each
have
recourse
to
sword
,
as
all
their
piece
have
be
discharge
,
Renaldo
's
adversary
,
find
himself
press
with
equal
fury
and
skill
,
retreat
gradually
among
the
tree
,
until
he
vanish
altogether
into
the
thick
of
the
wood
;
and
his
two
companion
follow
his
example
with
great
ease
,
the
valet
de
chambre
be
hurt
in
the
leg
,
and
the
stranger
so
much
exhaust
by
the
wound
he
have
receive
before
Renaldo
's
interposition
,
that
when
the
young
gentleman
approach
to
congratulate
him
on
the
defeat
of
the
robber
,
he
,
in
advance
to
embrace
his
deliverer
,
dropt
down
motionless
on
the
grass
.
    
<EOS>
the
count
,
with
that
warmth
of
sympathy
and
benevolence
which
be
natural
to
his
heart
,
lift
up
the
wounded
cavalier
in
his
arm
,
and
carry
him
to
the
chaise
,
in
which
he
be
deposit
,
while
the
valet
de
chambre
reload
his
pistol
,
and
prepare
for
a
second
attack
,
as
they
do
not
doubt
that
the
bandit
would
return
with
a
reinforcement
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
before
they
re
-
appear
,
Renaldo
's
driver
disengage
him
from
the
wood
,
and
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
arrive
at
a
village
,
where
they
halt
for
assistance
to
the
stranger
,
who
,
tho
'
still
alive
,
have
not
recover
the
use
of
his
sense

<EOS>
after
he
be
undress
and
lay
in
a
warm
bed
,
a
surgeon
examine
his
body
,
and
find
a
wound
in
his
neck
by
a
sword
,
and
another
in
his
right
side
occasion
by
a
pistol
-
shoot
;
so
that
his
prognostic
be
very
dubious
:
<EOS>
mean
<EOS>
while
,
he
apply
proper
dressing
to
both
;
and
,
in
half
an
hour
after
this
administration
,
the
gentleman
give
some
token
of
perception
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
around
him
with
a
wildness
of
fury
in
his
aspect
,
as
if
he
have
think
himself
in
the
hand
of
the
robber
by
whom
he
have
be
attack
:
<EOS>
but
,
when
he
see
the
assiduity
with
which
the
by
-
stander
exert
themselves
in
his
behalf
,
one
raise
his
head
from
the
pillow
,
while
another
exhort
him
to
swallow
a
little
wine
which
be
warm
for
the
purpose
;
when
he
behold
the
sympathise
look
of
all
present
,
and
hear
himself
accost
in
the
most
cordial
term
by
the
person
whom
he
recollect
as
his
deliverer
;
all
the
severity
vanish
from
his
countenance
;
he
take
Renaldo
's
hand
and
press
it
to
his
lip
;
and
while
the
tear
gush
from
his
eye
,
"
praise
be
God
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
virtue
and
generosity
be
still
to
be
find
among
the
son
of
man
.
"
    
<EOS>
every
body
in
the
apartment
be
affect
by
this
exclamation
;
and
Melvile
,
above
all
the
rest
,
feel
such
emotion
as
he
could
scarcely
restrain
.
    
<EOS>
He
intreate
the
gentleman
to
believe
himself
in
the
midst
of
such
friend
as
would
effectually
secure
him
from
all
violence
and
mortification
;
he
conjure
him
to
compose
the
perturbation
of
his
spirit
,
and
quiet
the
apprehension
of
his
mind
with
that
reflection
;
and
protest
,
that
he
himself
would
not
quit
the
house
while
his
attendance
should
be
deem
necessary
for
the
stranger
's
cure
,
or
his
conversation
conducive
to
his
amusement
.
    
<EOS>
these
assurance
,
consider
with
the
heroic
part
which
the
young
Hungarian
have
already
act
in
his
behalf
,
inspire
the
cavalier
with
such
a
sublime
idea
of
Melvile
,
that
he
gaze
upon
him
with
silent
astonishment
,
as
an
angel
send
from
heaven
for
his
succour
;
and
in
the
transport
of
his
gratitude
,
could
not
help
exclaim
,
"
sure
providence
hath
still
something
in
reserve
for
this
unfortunate
wretch
,
in
whose
favour
such
a
miracle
of
courage
and
generosity
hath
interpose
!
"
    
<EOS>
be
accommodate
with
proper
care
and
attendance
,
his
constitution
in
a
little
time
overcome
the
fever
;
and
at
the
third
dressing
,
the
surgeon
declare
him
out
of
all
danger
from
his
wound
.
 
<EOS>
then
be
Renaldo
indulge
with
opportunity
of
converse
with
the
patient
,
and
of
inquire
into
the
particular
of
his
fortune
and
design
in
life
,
with
a
view
to
manifest
the
inclination
he
feel
to
serve
him
in
his
future
occasion
.
    
<EOS>
the
more
this
stranger
contemplate
the
character
of
the
count
<EOS>
,
the
more
his
amazement
increase
,
on
account
of
his
extraordinary
benevolence
in
favour
of
a
person
whose
merit
he
could
not
possibly
know
;
he
even
express
his
surprize
on
this
subject
to
Renaldo
,
who
at
length
tell
him
,
that
,
although
his
good
office
should
always
be
ready
for
the
occasion
of
any
gentleman
in
distress
,
his
particular
attachment
and
regard
to
him
be
improve
by
an
additional
consideration
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
no
stranger
(
say
he
)
to
the
virtue
and
honour
of
the
gallant
Don
Diego
de
Zelos
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
Heaven
and
earth
!
"
cry
the
stranger
,
start
from
his
seat
with
extreme
emotion
,
"
do
I
then
live
to
hear
myself
address
by
that
long
lose
appellation
!
<EOS>
my
heart
glow
at
the
expression
!
<EOS>
my
spirit
be
kindle
with
a
flame
that
thrill
through
every
nerve
!
 
<EOS>
Say
,
young
gentleman
,
if
you
be
really
an
inhabitant
of
earth
,
by
what
mean
be
you
acquaint
with
the
unhappy
name
of
Zelos
?
"
    
<EOS>
in
answer
to
this
eager
intorrogation
,
Renaldo
give
him
to
understand
,
that
in
the
course
of
his
travel
,
he
have
reside
a
short
time
at
Seville
,
where
he
have
frequently
see
Don
Diego
,
and
often
hear
his
character
mention
with
uncommon
esteem
and
veneration
.
 
<EOS>
"
alas
!
"
reply
the
Castilian
,
"
that
justice
be
no
longer
do
to
the
wretched
Zelos
;
his
honour
be
blast
,
and
his
reputation
canker
bite
by
the
venomous
tooth
of
slander
.
"
    
<EOS>
He
then
proceed
to
unfold
his
misfortune
,
as
they
have
already
be
explain
in
the
first
volume
of
these
memoir
;
at
the
recapitulation
of
which
,
the
heart
of
Melvile
be
intendere
by
his
own
calamity
,
be
so
deeply
affected
,
that
he
re
-
echo
the
groan
of
Don
Diego
,
and
weep
over
his
suffering
with
the
most
filial
sympathy
.
    
<EOS>
when
he
repeat
the
story
of
that
cruel
fraud
,
which
be
practise
upon
him
by
the
faithless
Fadini
,
Melvile
,
whose
mind
and
imagination
teem
with
the
villainy
of
Fathom
,
be
immediately
strike
with
the
conjecture
of
his
be
the
knave
;
because
,
indeed
,
he
could
not
believe
,
that
any
other
person
be
so
abandon
,
by
principle
and
humanity
,
as
to
take
such
a
barbarous
advantage
of
a
gentleman
in
distress
.
     
<EOS>
His
return
to
England
,
and
midnight
pilgrimage
to
Monimia
's
tomb
.
   
<EOS>
He
consider
the
date
of
that
unparalelled
transaction
,
which
agree
with
his
conjecture
,
and
from
the
inquiry
he
make
concern
the
person
of
the
traitor
,
gather
reason
sufficient
to
confirm
his
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
thus
certify
,
"
that
be
the
villain
,
cry
the
Count
,
whose
infernal
art
have
overwhelm
me
with
such
misery
as
heaven
itself
hath
no
remedy
to
dispel
!
 
<EOS>
to
revenge
my
wrong
on
that
perfidious
miscreant
,
be
one
of
the
chief
reason
for
which
I
deign
to
drag
about
an
hateful
being
.
 
<EOS>
o
Don
Diego
!
<EOS>
what
be
life
,
when
all
its
enjoyment
be
so
easily
poison
by
the
machination
of
such
a
worm
!
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
smite
his
breast
in
all
the
agony
of
woe
,
and
besought
the
Spaniard
to
relate
the
step
he
take
in
consequence
of
this
disaster
.
    
<EOS>
the
Castilian
's
cheek
redden
at
this

his

up
his

to

"
sacred
power
!
<EOS>
(
cry
he
)
<EOS>
let
him
not
perish
,
before
you
bring
him
within
my
reach
.
 
<EOS>
You
ask
,
me
,
noble
cavalier
,
what
measure
I
take
in
this
abyss
of
misery
.
    
<EOS>
for
the
first
day
,
I
be
torture
with
apprehension
for
the
friendly
Fadini
,
fear
that
he
have
be
rob
and
murthere
for
the
jewel
which
he
have
,
perhaps
,
too
unwarily
expose
to
sale
:
but
this
terror
soon
vanish
before
the
true
presage
of
my
fate
;
when
,
on
the
morrow
,
I
find
the
whole
family
in
tear
and
confusion
,
and
hear
my
landlord
pour
forth
the
most
bitter
imprecation
against
the
fugitive
,
who
have
deflower
his
daughter
,
and
even
rob
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
ask
,
which
of
the
passion
of
my
heart
be
interested
on
this
occasion
;
they
be
shame
and
indignation
:
all
my
grief
flow
in
another
channel
:
 
<EOS>
I
blush
to
find
my
judgment
deceive
:
 
<EOS>
I
scorn
to
complain
;
but
in
my
heart
denounce
vengeance
against
my
base
betrayer
.
 
<EOS>
I
silently
retire
to
my
apartment
,
in
order
to
commune
with
my
own
thought
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
bear
great
calamity
,
without
be
drive
to
despair
:
 
<EOS>
I
summon
all
my
fortitude
to
my
assistance
,
and
resolve
to
live
in
spite
of
affliction
.
 
<EOS>
thus
determine
,
I
betook
myself
,
to
the
house
of
a
general
officer
,
whose
character
be
fair
in
the
world
;
and
have
obtain
admission
in
consequence
of
my
oriental
appearance
;
"
to
a
man
of
honour
,
say
I
,
the
unfortunate
need
no
introduction
:
my
habit
proclaim
me
a
Persian
;
this
passport
from
the
States
of
Holland
will
confirm
that
supposition
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
rob
of
jewel
,
to
a
considerable
value
,
by
a
wretch
whom
I
favour
with
my
confidence
;
and
now
,
reduce
to
extreme
indigence
,
I
come
to
offer
myself
as
a
soldier
in
the
army
of
France
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
health
and
strength
sufficient
to
discharge
that
duty
:
nor
be
I
unacquainted
with
a
military
life
,
which
be
once
my
glory
and
occupation
.
    
<EOS>
I
therefore
sue
for
your
protection
,
that
I
may
be
receive
,
though
in
the
low
order
of
them
that
serve
the
king
;
and
that
your
future
favour
may
depend
upon
my
behaviour
in
that
capacity
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
general
,
surprize
at
my
declaration
,
survey
me
with
uncommon
attention
;
he
peruse
my
certificate
,
ask
diver
question
concern
the
art
of
war
,
to
which
I
return
such
answer
as
convince
him
that
I
be
not
wholly
ignorant
in
that
particular
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
be
inliste
as
a
volunteer
in
his
own
regiment
,
and
soon
after
promote
to
the
rank
of
a
subaltern
,
and
the
office
of
equerry
to
his
own
son
,
who
,
at
that
time
,
have
attain
to
the
degree
of
colonel
,
though
his
age
do
not
exceed
eighteen
year
.
    
<EOS>
this
young
man
be
naturally
of
a
ferocious
disposition
,
which
have
be
render
quite
untractable
by
the
pride
of
birth
and
fortune
,
together
with
the
licence
of
his
education
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
do
not
know
the
respect
due
to
a
gentleman
,
so
he
could
not
possibly
pay
it
to
those
who
be
unfortunately
under
his
command
.
 
<EOS>
Divers
mortification
I
sustain
with
that
fortitude
which
become
a
Castilian
who
lie
under
obligation
to
the
father
;
till
at
length
,
lay
aside
all
decorum
,
he
smite
me
.
 
<EOS>
Sacred

!
<EOS>
he
smite
Don
Diego
de

in

of
his
whole
houshold

<EOS>
have
my
sword
be
endow
with
sensation
,
it
would
of
itself
have
start
from
the
scabbard
,
at
this
indignity
offer
to
its
master
.
 
<EOS>
I
unsheathe
it
without
deliberation
,
say
,
"
know
,
<EOS>
insolent
boy
,
he
be
a
gentleman
whom
thou
hast
thus
outrage
;
and
thou
hast
cancel
the
tie
which
have
hitherto
restrain
my
indignation

"
    
<EOS>
His
servant
would
have
interpose
,
but
he
command
them
to
retire
;
and
flush
with
that
confidence
which
the
impetuosity
of
his
temper
inspire
,
he
draw
in
his
turn
,
and
attack
me
with
redouble
rage
;
but
his
dexterity
be
very
unequal
to
his
courage
,
he
be
soon
disarm
and
overthrow
;
when
point
my
sword
to
his
breast
,
"
in
consideration
of
thy
youth
and
ignorance
,
say
I
,
I
spare
that
life
which
thou
hast
forfeit
by
thy
ungenerous
presumption
.
"
    
<EOS>
with
these
word
I
put
up
my
weapon
,
retire
through
the
midst
of
his
domestic
,
who
see
their
master
safe
,
do
not
think
proper
to
oppose
my
passage
,
and
mount
my
horse

in
less
than
two
hour
enter
the
austrian
dominion
,
resolve
to
proceed
as
far
as
Holland
,
that
I
may
embark
in
the
first
ship
for
Spain
,
in
order
to
wash
away
,
with
my
own
blood
,
or
that
of
my
enemy
,
the
cruel
stain
which
hath
so
long
defile
my
reputation

<EOS>
this
be
the
grievance
that
still
corrode
my
heart
,
and
render
ineffectual
the
inhuman
sacrifice
I
have
make
to
my
injured
honour
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
consideration
that
incessantly
prompt
,
and
still
importune
,
me
to
run
every
risque
of
life
and
fortune
,
rather
than
leave
my
fame
under
such
an
ignominious
aspersion
.
 
<EOS>
I
purpose
to
obey
this
internal
call
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
apt
to
believe
it
be
the
voice
of
heaven
;
of
that
providence
which
manifest
its
care
by
send
such
a
generous
auxiliary
to
my
aid
,
when
I
be
overpower
by
banditti
,
on
the
very
first
day
of
my
expedition
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
have
in
this
manner
gratify
the
curiosity
of
his
deliverer
,
he
express
a
desire
of
know
the
quality
of
him
to
whom
he
be
so
signally
oblige
;
and
Renaldo
do
not
scruple
to
make
the
castilian
acquaint
with
his
name
and
family
:
he
likewise
communicate
the
story
of
his
unfortunate
love
,
with
all
the
symptom
of
unutterable
woe
,
which
draw
tear
from
the
noble
-
hearted
Spaniard
,
while
with
a
groan
that
announce
the
load
which
overwhelm
his
soul
,
"
I
have
a
daughter
,
say
he
,
such
as
you
describe
the
peerless
Monimia
,
have
heaven
decreed
her
for
the
arm
of
such
a
lover
,
I
,
who
be
now
the
most
wretched
<EOS>
,
should
have
be
the
most
happy
parent
upon
earth
.
"
    
<EOS>
thus
do
these
new
friend
alternately
indulge
their
mutual
sorrow
,
and
concert
measure
for
their
future
operation
.
 
<EOS>
Melvile
earnestly
sollicite
the
Castilian
to
favour
him
with
his
company
to
England
,
where
,
in
all
probability
,
both
would
enjoy
the
gloomy
satisfaction
of
be
revenge
upon
their
common
betrayer
Fathom
;
and
as
a
farther
inducement
,
he
assure
him
,
that
as
soon
as
he
should
have
accomplish
the
melancholy
purpose
of
his
voyage
,
he
would
accompany
Don
Diego
to
Spain
,
and
employ
his
whole
interest
and
fortune
in
his
service
.
 
<EOS>
the
Spaniard
,
thunderstruck
at
the
extravagant
generosity
of
this
proposal
,
could
scarce
believe
the
evidence
of
his
own
sense
,
and
after
some
pause
,
reply
,
"
My
duty
would
teach
me
to
obey
any
command
you
should
think
proper
to
impose
;
but
here
my
inclination
and
interest
be
so
agreeably
flatter
,
that
I
should
be
equally
ungrateful
and
unwise
,
in
pretend
to
comply
with
reluctance
.
"
    
<EOS>
this
point
be
settle
,
they
move
forwards
to
Mons
,
as
soon
as
Don
Diego
be
in
a
condition
to
bear
the
shock
of
such
a
removal
;
and
there
remain
until
his
wound
be
perfectly
cure

they
hire
a
post
-
chaise
for
Ostend

embark
in
a
vessel
at
that
port

reach
the
opposite
shore
of

after
a
short
and
easy
passage

arrive
in
London
without
have
meet
with

sinister
accident
on

road

as
they
approach
this
capital
,
Renaldo
's
grief
seem
to
regurgitate
with
redouble
violence

<EOS>
His
memory
be
wake
to
the
most
minute
and
painful
exertion
of
its
faculty
;
his
imagination
teem
with
the
most
afflicting
image
,
and
his
impatience
become
so
ardent
,
that
never
lover
pant
more
eagerly
for
the
consummation
of
his
wish
,
than
Melvile
for
an
opportunity
of
stretch
himself
upon
the
grave
of
the
lose
Monimia
.
 
<EOS>
the
Castilian
be
astonish
,
as
well
as
affect
at
the
poignancy
of
his
grief
,
which
,
as
a
proof
of
his
susceptibility
and
virtue
,
endear
him
still
more
to
his
affection
;
and
though
his
own
misfortune
have
render
him
very
unfit
for
the
office
of
a
comforter
,
he
endeavour
,
by
soothe
discourse

to
moderate
the
excess
of
his

affliction

inn

Melvile

very
plentifully

kind

Joshua

with
the
occasion
of
his
coming

and
the
dismal
image
of
his

to
produce

to
the

earth
:
 
"
Peace

in
the
dispute

say
,
"
You
need
not
be
afraid
that

will
obey
the

his

I
will
watch

He

Renaldo

He

in

the
night

enjoyment

which
the

His

forth

more
at
ease

have
ever

since
he
first
receive
the
fatal
intimation
of
his
loss
;
that
a
few
such
feast
would
entirely
moderate
the
keen
appetite
of
his
sorrow

which
he
would
afterwards
feed
with
less
precipitation

He
also
impart
to
the
Castilian

the
plan
of
a
monument

incomparable
Monimia

His

<EOS>
this
be
the
beginning
of
a
conversation
touch
that
lovely
victim

in
the
course
of
which
,
he
explain
those
wicked
art
which
Fathom
practise
to
alienate
his
affection
from
the
adorable
Monimia
;
and
she
describe
the
cunning
hint
and
false
insinuation
by
which
that
traitor
have
asperse
the
unsuspecting
lover
,
and
soil
his
character
in
the
opinion
of
the
virtuous
orphan
.
    
<EOS>
the
intelligence
he
obtain
,
on
this
occasion

add
indignation
to
his
grief

<EOS>
the
whole
mystery
of
Monimia
's
behaviour
,
which
he
could
not
before
explain
,
now
stand
disclose
before
him
:
he
see
the
gradual
progress
of
that
infernal
plan
,
which
have
be
lay
for
their
mutual
ruin
;
and
his
soul
be
inflame
with
such
desire
of
vengeance
,
that
he
would
have
take
his
leave
abruptly
,
in
order
to
set
on
foot
an
immediate
enquiry
about
the
perfidious
author
of
his
wrong
,
that
he
may
exterminate
such
a
monster
of
iniquity
from
the
face
of

but
he
be
restrain

Madam
Clement

who
give
him
to
understand
,
that
Fathom

for
she
have
trace
him
in

<EOS>
She
represent
the
villain
as
a
wretch
altogether
unworthy

she
say
,
he
be
so
cover
with
infamy
,
that
no
person
could
enter
the
list
against
him
,
without

that
he
be
a
venomous
serpent

which
it
be

that
it
be
the
duty
of
every
man
to
contribute
his

to
pass
with
impunity

virtue

dealing

by

him
to
bear
with
the
peevishness
of

disposition

sore
with
the
gall
hand
of
affliction
;

up
his
eye
to
heaven

be
it
possible
,
cry
he
,
for
fate
to
reconcile
contradiction
,
and
recal
the
irremeable
current
of

,
I
would
now
believe
,
that
there
be
happiness
still
in
reserve
for
the
forlorn
Zelos
:
now
that
I
tread
the
land
of
freedom
and
humanity
;
now
that
I
find
myself
befriend
by
the
most
generous
of
man

alas
!
<EOS>
I
ask
not
happiness
!

if
by
the
kind
endeavour
of
the
gallant
count
de
Melvile

to
whom
I
be
already
indebted
for
my
life

by
the
effort

his

shall
be
purify
and
clear
from
the
poisonous
stain
of
malice

by
which
it

I
shall
then
enjoy
all
that
satisfaction

which
destiny
can
bestow

incurable

<EOS>
Renaldo
comfort
him
with
the
assurance
of
his
being
on
the
eve
of
triumph
over
his
adversary
:
and
Joshua
confirm
the
consolation
,
by
give
him
to
understand
,
that
he
have
correspondent
in
Spain
,
of
some
influence
in
the
state
;
that
he
have
already
write
to
them
on
the
subject
of
Don
Diego
,
in
consequence
of
a
letter
which
he
have
receive
from
Melvile
,
while
he
tarry
at
Mons
,
and
that
he
,
every
post
,
expect
a
favourable
answer
on
that
subject
.
    
<EOS>
after
dinner
,
the
physician
take
his
leave
,
though
not
before
he
have
promise
to
meet
Renaldo
at
night
,
and
accompany
him
in
the
repetition
of
his
midnight
visit
to
Monimia
's
tomb
:
for
this
pilgrimage
the
unfortunate
youth
resolve
nightly
to
perform
,
during
the
whole
time
of
his
residence
in
England
:
it
be
,
indeed
,
a
sort
of
pleasure
,
the
prospect
of
which
enable
him
to
bear
the
toil
of
live
through
the
day
;
though
his
patience
be
almost
quite
exhausted
before
the
hour
of
assignation
arrive
.
    
<EOS>
when
the
doctor
appear
with
the
coach
,
he
leap
into
it
with
great
eagerness
,
after
he
have
,
with
much
difficulty
,
prevail
with
Don
Diego
to
stay
at
home
,
on
account
of
his
health
,
which
be
not
yet
perfectly
establish
.
 
<EOS>
the
Castilian
,
however
,
would
not
comply
with
his
request
,
untill
he
have
obtain
the
Count
's
promise
,
that
he
should
be
permit
to
accompany
him
next
night
,
and
take
that
duty
alternately
with
the
physician
.
    
<EOS>
about
midnight
they
reach
the
place
,
where
they
find
the
sexton
in
wait
,
accord
to
the
order
he
have
receive
:
the
door
be
open
,
the
mourner
conduct
to
the
tomb
,
and
leave
,
as
before
,
to
the
gloom
of
his
own
meditation
.
 
<EOS>
again
he
lay
himself
on
the
cold
ground
;
again
he
renew
his
lamentable
strain
;
his
imagination
begin
to
be
heat
into
an
extacy
of
enthusiasm
,
during
which
he
again
fervently
invoke
the
spirit
of
his
deceased
Monimia
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
these
invocation
,
his
ear
be
suddenly
invade
with
the
sound
of
some
few
solemn
note
,
issue
from
the
organ
,
which
seem
to
feel
the
impulse
of
an
invisible
hand
.
    
<EOS>
at
this
awful
salutation
,
Melvile
be
rouse
to
the
keen
sense
of
surprize
and
attention
:
reason
shrink
before
the
throng
idea
of
his
fancy
,
which
represent
this
music
as
the
prelude
to
something
strange
and
supernatural
;
and
while
he
wait
for
the
sequel
,
the
place
be
suddenly
illuminate
,
and
each
surround
object
bring
under
the
cognizance
of
his
eye
.
    
<EOS>
what
pass
within
his
mind
on
this
occasion
,
be
not
easy
to
describe
;
his
faculty
be
swallow
up
by
those
of
see
and
hear
:
he
have
mechanically
raise
himself
upon
one
knee
,
with
his
body
advance
forwards
;
and
in
this
attitude
he
gaze
with
a
look
,
through
which
his
soul
seem
eager
to
escape
.
    
<EOS>
to
his
view
,
thus
strain
upon
vacant
space
,
in
a
few
minue
appear
the
figure
of
a
woman
array
in
white
,
with
a
veil
that
cover
her
face
,
and
flow
down
upon
her
back
and
shoulder
:
 
<EOS>
the
phantome
approach
him
with
an
easy
step
,
and
lift
up
her
veil
discover
(
believe
it
,
o
reader
!
)
<EOS>
the
individual
countenance
of
Monimia
.
    
<EOS>
at
sight
of
these
well
know
feature
,
seemingly
improve
with
new
celestial
grace
,
the
youth
become
a
statue
,
express
amazement
,
love
,
and
awful
adoration
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
the
apparition
smile
with
meek
benevolence
,
divine
compassion
,
warm
and
intendere
by
that
fond
,
pure
flame
,
which
death
could
not
extinguish
:
he
hear
the
voice
of
his
Monimia
call
Renaldo
!
 
<EOS>
Thrice
he
essay
to
answer
;
as
oft
his
tongue
deny
its
office
:
his
hair
stand
upright
,
and
a
cold
vapour
seem
to
thrill
through
every
nerve
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
not
fear
,
but
the
infirmity
of
human
nature
,
oppress
by
the
presence
of
a
superior
being
.
    
<EOS>
at
length
his
agony
be
overcome
;
he
recollect
all
his
resolution
,
and
in
a
strain
of
awe
-
strike
rapture
,
thus
address
the
heavenly
visitant
.
 
<EOS>
"

from

in

eager

at

trace
the
footstep

which
enter
a

sink
down
upon

with
a
sigh
exclaim

of
madame
Clement
,
with
an
earnest
intreaty
,
that
it
should
not
be
send
till
after
her
decease
:
but
that
lady
believe
the
count
have
be
certainly
abuse
by
his
treacherous
confident
,
dispatch
the
billet
without
the
knowledge
of
Monimia
,
whose
health
be
restore
by
the
indefatigable
care
of
the
physician
,
and
the
sage
exhortation
of
the
clergyman
,
by
which
she
be
reconcile
to
life
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
the
villainy
of
Fathom
have
inspire
her
with
some
faint
hope
that
Renaldo
may
still
be
innocent
;
and
that
notion
contribute
not
a
little
to
her
cure
.
    
<EOS>
the
letter
have
so
effectually
answer
their
warm
hope
,
in
bring
back
Renaldo
such
a
pattern
of
constancy
and
love
;
the
confederate
,
in
consequence
of
his
enthusiastic
sorrow
,
have
plan
this
meeting
,
as
the
most
interesting
way
of
restore
two
virtuous
lover
to
the
arm
of
each
other
;
for
which
purpose
the
good
clergyman
have
pitch
upon
his
own
church
,
and
indulge
them
with
the
use
of
the
vestry
,
in
which
they
now
be
present
with
a
small
but
elegant
collation
.
    
<EOS>
Melvile
hear
this
succinct
detail
with
equal
joy
and
admiration
:
he
pour
forth
the
dictate
of
his
gratitude
to
the
preserver
of
his
happiness
:
 
"
this
church
,
say
he
,
shall
henceforth
possess
a
double
share
of
my
veneration
;
this
holy
man
will
,
I
hope
,
finish
the
charitable
work
he
have
begin
,
by
tie
those
band
of
our
happiness
,
which
nought
but
death
shall
have
power
to
unbind
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
turn
to
that
object
which
be
the
star
of
his
regard
,
"
do
I
not
over
-
rate
,
say
he
,
my
interest
with
the
fair
Monimia
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
make
no
verbal
reply
;
but
answer
by
an
emphatic
glance
,
more
eloquent
than
all
the
power
of
rhetorick
and
speech
.
 
<EOS>
this
language
,
which
be
universal
in
the
world
of
love
,
he
perfectly
well
understand
,
and
in
token
of
that
faculty
,
seal
the
assent
which
she
have
smile
,
with
a
kiss
imprint
on
her
polished
forehead
.
    
<EOS>
in
order
to
dissipate
those
interesting
idea
,
which
,
by
be
too
long
indulge
,
may
have
endanger
his
reason
,
madame

to

with
a
detail
of
what

happen
to
him
in

he
explain
his
obligation
to
the
benevolent
Jew

relate
the
step

have
take
at
Vienna
for
the
recovery
of

happy
rencounter

of
the
danger
into
which
his
life
have
be
precipitate
by
the
news
of
Monimia
's
death
;
and
lastly
,
of
his
adventure
with
the
bandit
,
in
favour
of
a
gentleman
,
who
(
he
afterwards
understand
)
have
be
rob
in
the
most
base
and
barbarous
manner
by
Fathom

He

of
all

and
of
his
mistress
in

his

that
all

no
more
than
an
unsubstantial

He

"
Count
Melvile
have
reason

to

his
misfortune

villainy

mine

the
fruit

the

traitor
:

affectionate

he
be
fraught

<EOS>
doubtless
,
his
heart
must
have
deeply
suffer
;
his
behaviour
denote
the
keenness
of
his
woe
;
his
eye
be
ever

flow
fountain
of
tear
;
his
bosom
the
habitation
of
sigh
;
five
hundred
league
hath
he
measure
in
a

to
her
tomb

nightly

the
dreary
vault
where
she
now
lie
at

solitary

Such

the

Don

be
confound
at

Melvile
assure
this
disconsolate
father
,
that
no
pleasure
,
no
avocation
should
ever
so
entirely
ingross
his
mind
,
but
that
he
should
still
find
an
hour
for
sympathy

friendship
:
he
communicate
the
invitation
of
madame

and
insist
upon
his
compliance

that
he
may
have
an
opportunity
of

I
can
refuse
nothing

reply
the

it
be
ungrateful
in
me
to
decline
the
honour
you
propose

I
own
myself
inflame
with
a

Melvile
would
take
no

have
obtain
his
consent

repair
to
the
house
of
Joshua

whose
countenance
seem
to
unbend
gradually
,
into
a
total
expression
of
joy
and
surprize
,
as
he
learn
the
circumstance
of
this
amazing
event

he
faithfully
promise
to
attend
the
count
at
the

hour

and
in
the
mean
time
earnestly
exhort
him
to
take
some
repose
,
in
order
to
quiet
the
agitation
of
his
spirit

which
must

have
be
violently
hurry
on
this
occasion

<EOS>
the
advice
be
salutary
,
and
Renaldo
resolve
to
follow
it

<EOS>
He
return
to
his
lodging

lay
himself
down
;
but
,
notwithstanding
the
fatigue
he
have
undergo

refuse

all

his

arise
in
the
forenoon
with
more
serenity

every

his

with
new
rapture

when
he
find
himself
on
the
brink
of
possess
all
that
his

hold
dear

put
on
his
gay
look

insist
upon
the
Castilian

the

honour
to
the
occasion

and
the
alteration
of
dress
produce
such
an
advantageous
change
in
the
appearance
of

,
that
when
Joshua
arrive
at
the

hour
,
he
could
scarce
recognize
his
feature
,
and
compliment
him
very
politely
on
the
improvement

true
it
be

the

be
a
personage
of
a

have
not

by
increase
his
native

in

to
go
thither
and
conduct
her
to
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
slow
in
avail
himself
of
this
permission
:
he
disappear
in
an
instant
,
and
during
his
short
absence
,
don
Diego
be
strangely
disturb
:
the
blood
flush
,
and
forsook
his
cheek
by
turn
;
a
cold
vapour
seem
to
shiver
through
his
nerve
:
and
at
his
breast
he
feel
uncommon
palpitation
.
 
<EOS>
Madame
Clement
observe
his
discomposure
,
and
kindly
enquire
into
the
cause
;
when
he
reply
,
"
I
have
such
an
interest
in
what
concern
the
count
de
Melvile
,
and
my
imagination
be
so
much
prepossess
with
the
perfection
of
Monimia
,
that
I
be
,
as
it
be
,
agonize
with
expection
;
yet
never
do
my
curiosity
before
raise
such
tumult
as
those
that
now
agitate
my
form
!
"
    
<EOS>
He
have
scarce
pronounce
these
word
,
when
the
door
re
-
opening
,
Renaldo
lead
in
this
mirror
of
elegance
and
beauty
,
at
sight
of
whom
the
Israelite
's
countenance
be
distort
into
a
stare
of
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
such
be
the
astonishment
of
Joshua
,
what
be
the
emotion
of
the
Castilian
,
when
,
in
the
beauteous
orphan
,
he
behold
the
individual
feature
of
his
long
lose
Serafina
!
    
<EOS>
His
feeling
be
not
to
be
describe
;
the
fond
parent
,
whose
affection
shoot
even
to
a
sense
of
pain
,
feel
not
half
such
transport
,
when
he
unexpectedly
retrieve
a
darle
child
from
the
engulphe
billow
or
devour
flame
.
 
<EOS>
the
hope
of
Zelos
have
be
totally
extinguish
;
his
heart
have
be
incessantly
tear
with
anguish
and
remorse
,
upbraid
him
as
the
murtherer
of
Serafina
.
 
<EOS>
His
therefore
be
the
additional
transport
of
a
father
disburthene
of
the
guilt
of
such
enormous
homicide
.
 
<EOS>
His
nerve
be
too
much
overpower
by
this
sudden
recognition
,
to
manifest
the
sensation
of
his
soul
by
external
sign
.
 
<EOS>
He
start
not
,
nor
do
he
lift
an
hand
in
token
of
surprize
;
he
move
not
from
the
spot
on
which
he
stand
,
but
,
rivette
his
eye
to
those
of
the
lovely
phantome
,
remain
without
motion
,
until
she
,
approach
with
her
lover
,
fall
at
his
foot
,
and
clasp
his
knee
,
exclaim
,
"
May
I
yet
call
you
father
?
"
    
<EOS>
this
powerful
shock
arrouze
the
faculty
;
a
cold
sweat
bedew
his
forehead
;
his
knee
begin
to
totter
;
he
drop
upon
the
floor
,
and
throw
his
arm
around
her
,
cry
,
"
o
nature
!
<EOS>
o
Serafina
!
<EOS>
merciful
providence
<EOS>
,
thy
way
be
past
find
out
.
"
    
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
fall
upon
her
neck
,
and
weep
aloud
:
the
tear
of
sympathetic
joy
trickle
down
her
snowy
bosom
,
that
heave
with
rapture
inexpressible
.
 
<EOS>
Renaldo
's
eye
pour
forth
the
briny
stream
:
the
cheeck
of
madame
Clement
be
not
dry
in
this
conjuncture
:
she
kneel
by
Serafina
,
kiss
her
with
all
the
eagerness
of
maternal
affection
,
and
with
uplifted
hand
adore
the
power
that
pre
-
ordain
this
blessed
event
:
the
clergyman
and
doctor
intimately
share
the
general
transport
;
and
as
for
Joshua
,
the
drop
of
true
benevolence
flow
from
his
eye
,
like
the
oil
on
Aaron
's
beard
,
while
he
skip
about
the
room
in
an
aukward
extacy
,
and
in
a
voice
resemble
the
hoarse
note
of
the
long
-
eared
tribe
,
cry
,
"
o
father
Abraham
!
<EOS>
such
a
moving
scene

not

himself
unto

<EOS>
Don

have
find
utterance
to
his

proceed
in
this
strain

I

by

in
the
fond
enquiry

I
find
my

unreal

awake
to
misery
again

"
    
<EOS>
"
O
ever
honour

<EOS>
she
reply
,
if
to
see
your
Serafina
at
your
foot
,
melt
with
filial
love
and
veneration
,
can
impart
a
gleam
of
satisfaction
to
your

enjoy
that
pleasure
,
and
behold
her
now
restore
to
your
protection
and
paternal

she
never

<EOS>
alas

<EOS>
have
heaven
think
proper
to
reserve
another
parent
for
this
interview

our
joy

from

how

<EOS>
"
dismiss
that
fatal
thought

Serafina

my
mother
quietly
bad
adieu
to
life
in
England

she
peaceably
expire
within
these

with
her
late

thy

a
dreadful
burthen

<EOS>
I
be

<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>

that

Renaldo
,
but
first
permit
me
to
implore
your
sanction
to
my
passion

the
incomparable
Serafina

<EOS>
You
already
know
our
mutual
sentiment
;
and
though
I
own
the
possession
of
such
inestimable
worth
and
beauty
,
would
be
a
recompence
that
infinitely
transcend
the
merit
I
can
plead
,
yet
as
it
hath
be
my
good
fortune
to
inspire
her
with
a
mutual
flame
,
I
hope
to
reap
from
your
indulgence
,
what
I
could
not
expect
from
my
own
desert
;
and
here
we
present
ourselves
,
in
hope
of
your
paternal
assent
and
benediction
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
be
she
more
fair
,
and
good
,
and
gentle
than

answer
the
Castilian

(
and
to
my
partial
observation
,
nought
e'er
appear
on
earth
,
more
beauteous
and
engaging
)
<EOS>
I
would
approve
your
title
to
her
heart
,
and
recommend
you
to

smile
,
with
all
a

to

Enjoy

so
say
,
he
join
their
hand

and
embrace
them
with
the
most
cordial
love
and
satisfaction
,
which
diffuse
itself

fervently
invoke
the
Almighty
Power

<EOS>
the
tumult
of
these
emotion
have
a
little
subsided
,
and
the
Castilian
be
seat
betwixt
Renaldo
and
his
beauteous
bride

black
silk

for
the
purpose

turn
his
face

Good

countenance

"
     
<EOS>
a
retrospective
link
,
necessary
for
the
concatenation
of
these
memoir
.
   
<EOS>
"
indulge
me
with
a
patient
hearing
,
proceed
the
Hungarian
,
and
all
these
riddle
soon
will
be
explain
.
 
<EOS>
inflame
with
the
desire
of
see
foreign
country
,
I
disobey
the
will
of
an
indulgent
father
,
from
whose
house
withdraw
privately
,
I
set
out
for
Italy
,
in
disguise
,
by
the
way
of
Tyrol
,
visit
Venice
,
Rome
,
Florence
,
and
embark
at
Naples
,
in
an
english
ship
,
arrive
at
St
Lucar
,
from
whence
<EOS>
I
repair
to
Seville
;
there
,
in
a
few
day
,
be
my
curiosity
engage
by
the
fame
of
the
fair
Serafina
,
who
be
justly
deem
the
most
accomplished
beauty
in
that
part
of
Spain
.
    
<EOS>
Nay
,
blush
not
,
gentle
creature
!
<EOS>
for
,
by
my
hope
of
heaven
!
<EOS>
thy
charm
be
even
injure
by
the
cold
applause
of
that
report
:
nevertheless
,
I
be
warmly
interested
by
the
uncommon
character
,
and
eagerly
long
to
see
this
pattern
of
perfection
.
 
<EOS>
as
Don
Diego
do
not
train
her
up
in
that
restraint
to
which
the
spanish
lady
be
subject
,
I
soon
find
an
opportunity
of
see
her
at
church
;
and
no
person
here
present
will
,
I
presume
,
doubt
that
I
be
instantly
captivate
by
her
beauty
and
deportment
.
 
<EOS>
have
I
think
that
don
Diego
's
favour
be
unengage
,
perhaps
I
should
have
follow
the
dictate
of
vanity
and
inexperience
,
and
present
myself
in
my
own
character
,
among
the
croud
of
her
professed
admirer
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
her
father
have
be
an
officer
of
distinguished
rank
and
reputation
,
and
do
not
doubt
that
he
would
have
regard
a
young
soldier
of
unexceptionable
pedigree
,
and
I
will
even
add
,
of
unattainted
fame
:
nor
<EOS>
do
I
suppose
my
own
father
could
have
object
against
such
an
advantageous
match
;
but
,
by
dint
of
industrious
enquiry
,
I
learn
,
that
the
divine
Serafina
be
already
betroth
to
don
Manuel
de
Mendoza
,
and
this
information
overwhelm
me
with
despair
.
    
<EOS>
after
have
revolve
a
thousand
project
for
retarding
and
preventing
that
detest
union
,
I
resolve
to
avail
myself
of
my
talent
for
drawing
,
and
profess
myself
a
master
of
that
science
,
in
hope
of
be
employ
by
the
father
of
Serafina
,
who
,
I
know
,
let
slip
no
opportunity
of
improve
his
daughter
's
education
.
    
<EOS>
accordingly
I
have
the
good
fortune
to
attract
his
notice
,
be
invite
to
his
house
,
honour
with
his
approbation
,
and
furnish
with
unrestricted
opportunity
of
converse
with
the
dear
object
of
my
love
.
 
<EOS>
the
passion
which
her
beauty
have
kindle
,
be
,
by
the
perfection
of
her
mind
,
inflame
to
such
a
degree
of
transport
,
as
could
not
be
conceal
from
her
penetration
.
 
<EOS>
She
chance
to
relish
my
conversation
;
I
gradually
acquire
her
friendship
;
pity
be
the
next
passion
that
she
entertain
in
my
favour
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
venture
to
disclose
myself
,
and
the
dear
charmer
do
not
disapprove
of
my
presumption
.
 
<EOS>
She
and
her
mother
have
be
perplex
with
some
religious
scruple
,
concern
which
they
appeal
to
my
opinion
;
and
I
be
happy
enough
to
set
their
mind
at
ease
.
    
<EOS>
this
sort
of
intercourse
naturally
create
a
mutual
confidence
among
us
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
I
be
bless
with
the
daughter
's
love
and
mother
's
approbation
,
Don
Diego
will
pardon
those
clandestine
measure
which
we
take
,
from
a
full
persuasion
,
that
it
be
impossible
to
render
him
propitious
to
the
view
in
which
our
heart
and
hand
be
so
deeply
interested
:
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
then
know
how
little
he
be
addict
to
superstition
.
    
<EOS>
without
enter
into
a
detail
of
the
scheme
we
project
to
delay
the
happiness
of
Mendoza
,
I
shall
only
observe
,
<EOS>
that
know
the
fatal
day
be
,
at
length
,
unalterably
fix
,
we
determine
to
elude
the
purpose
of
don
Diego
by
flight
,
and
every
thing
be
actually
prepared
for
our
escape
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
hour
of
appointment
arrive
,
I
repair
to
the
place
at
which
I
have
propose
to
enter
the
house
,
and
stumble
,
in
the
dark
,
over
the
body
of
a
man
still
warm
and
bleeding
.
    
<EOS>
Alarmed
at
this
occurrence
,
I
dart
myself
through
the
window
,
and
rush
to
the
apartment
of
the
lady
,
(
immortal
power
!
)
<EOS>
beheld
the
peerless
Serafina
,
and
her
virtuous
mother
,
stretch
on
a
couch
,
and
in
all
appearance
deprive
of
life
.
    
<EOS>
the
company
will
easily
conceive
what
agony
I
feel
at
such
a
spectacle
.
 
<EOS>
I
run
towards
the
spot
in
a
transport
of
horror
!
 
<EOS>
I
clasp
my
lovely
mistress
in
my
arm
,
and
find
her
still
breathe
,
endeavour
,
but
in
vain
,
to
wake
her
from
the
trance
:
 
<EOS>
Antonia
be
overwhelm
with
the
same
lethargic
power
.
 
<EOS>
My
fancy
be
immediately
strike
with
the
apprehension
of
their
be
poison
.
 
<EOS>
regardless
of
my
own
situation
,
I
alarm
the
family
,
call
for
assistance
,
and
request
the
servant
to
summon
don
Diego
to
the
dismal
scene
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
inform
,
that
their
master
have
ride
forth
in
manifest
confusion
;
and
while
I
ponder
on
this
surprising
excursion
,
an
apothecary
in
the
neighbourhood
enter
the
chamber
,
and
have
examine
the
pulse
of
the
lady
,
declare
,
that
their
life
be
in
no
danger
,
and
advise
that
they
should
be
undress
and
convey
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
while
their
woman
be
busy
in
this
employment
,
I
go
into
the
court
-
yard
attend
by
some
of
the
servant
with
light
,
in
order
to
view
the
body
of
the
man
,
which
I
have
find
at
my
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
His
apparel
be
mean
,
his
countenance
ferocious
,
a
long
spado
be
buckle
to
his
thigh
,
and
in
his
belt
be
stick
a
brace
of
loaded
pistol
;
so
that
we
conclude
he
be
some
thief
,
who
have
wait
for
an
opportunity
,
and
see
the
casement
open
,
intend
to
rob
the
house
,
but
be
prevent
and
slay
by
don
Diego
himself
,
whose
retreat
,
however
,
do
not
a
little
confound
our
conjecture
.
    
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
remain
all
night
in
the
house
,
torture
with
fear
,
vexation
and
suspence
.
    
<EOS>
My
hope
be
altogether
disappoint
by
this
unhappy
accident
,
and
I
shudder
at
the
prospect
of
lose
Serafina
for
ever
,
either
by
this
mysterious
malady
,
or
by
her
marriage
with
Mendoza
,
which
I
now
despair
of
be
able
to
defeat
.
 
<EOS>
the
major
domo
have
wait
several
hour
for
his
lord
's
return
,
without
see
him
appear
,
think
proper
to
dispatch
a
messenger
to
don
Manuel
,
with
an
account
of
what
have
happen
;
and
that
nobleman
arrive
in
the
morning
,
take
possess
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
about
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
Serafina
begin
to
stir
,
and
at
five
she
and
her
mother
be
perfectly
awake
.
    
<EOS>
They
no
sooner
recover
the
use
of
reflection
,
than
they
give
sign
of
equal
sorrow
and
amazement
,
and
earnestly
call
for
Isabella
,
who
be
privy
to
our
design
,
and
who
,
after
a
very
minute
enquiry
,
be
find
in
a
lone
and
solitary
chamber
,
where
she
have
be
confine
.
    
<EOS>
Such
be
the
confusion
of
the
house
,
that
no
person
ever
dream
of
ask
how
I
have
enter
;
each
domestick
,
in
all
probability
,
suppose
that
I
have
be
introduce
by
his
fellow
:
so
that
I
tarry
unquestioned
,
on
pretence
of
concern
for
the
distress
of
a
family
,
in
which
I
have
be
so
generously
entertain
;
and
by
Isabella
send
my
respect
and
duty
to
her
lady
:
she
be
therefore
not
a
little
surprized
,
when
,
after
every
other
servant
have
withdraw
,
she
hear
the
lovely
Serafina
exclaim
,
with
all
the
violence
of
grief
,
"
ah
!
<EOS>
Isabella
,
Orlando
be
no
more
!
"
<EOS>
but
their
astonishment
be
still
great
,
when
she
assure
them
of
my
be
alive
,
and
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
They
recount
to
her
the
adventure
of
last
night
,
which
she
explain
by
inform
them
of
the
letter
which
don
Diego
have
intercept
:
and
they
immediately
conclude
,
that
he
have
,
in
the
precipitation
of
his
wrath
,
kill
,
by
mistake
,
the
person
who
be
find
dead
in
the
court
-
yard
.
 
<EOS>
this
conjecture
alarm
them
on
my
account
,
they
,
by
the
medium
of
Isabella
,
conjure
me
to
leave
the
house
,
lest
don
Diego
should
return
,
and
accomplish
his
resentment
;
and
I
be
persuade
to
withdraw
,
after
I
have
settle
the
channel
of
a
correspondence
with
the
confidante
.
    
<EOS>
be
now
oblige
to
alter
our
measure
,
because
our
former
intention
be
discover
by
don
Diego
,
I
secure
a
retreat
for
Serafina
and
her
mother
,
at
the
house
of
the
english
consul
in
Seville
,
who
be
my
particular
friend
;
and
next
day
understanding
,
from
Isabella
,
that
her
lord
have
not
yet
re
-
appeared
,
and
that
don
Manuel
be
very
urgent
in
his
address
,
we
concert
an
assignation
in
the
garden
,
and
that
same
evening
I
be
fortunate
enough
to
convey
my
prize
to
the
asylum
I
have
prepare
for
their
reception
.
 
<EOS>
Inexpressible
be
the
rage
of
Mendoza
,
when
he
hear
of
their
elopement
:
he
rave
like
one
deprive
of
reason
,
swear
he
would
put
all
the
servant
of
the
family
to
the
rack
,
and
in
consequence
of
the
intelligence
he
obtain
by
threat
and
promise
,
set
on
foot
a
very
strict
enquiry
,
in
order
to
apprehend
the
fugitive
and
Orlando
,
who
have
,
by
some
mean
or
other
,
incur
his
suspicion
.
    
<EOS>
We
elude
his
search
by
the
vigilance
and
caution
of
our
kind
host
;
and
while
we
remain
in
concealment
,
be
extremely
astonished
to
hear
,
that
the
unfortunate
don
Diego
be
proclaim
a
traitor
,
and
a
price
set
upon
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
this
information
overwhelm
us
all
with
the
utmost
affliction
:
 
Antonia
lament
,
without
cease
,
the
disgrace
of
her
beloved
lord
,
from
whom
she
never
would
have
withdraw
herself
,
but
with
the
lively
hope
of
a
reconciliation
,
after
the
first
transport
of
his
ire
should
have
subside
,
and
the
real
character
of
Orlando
should
have
appear
:
it
be
not
long
before
we
have
reason
to
believe
,
that
Mendoza
be
the
accuser
of
don
Diego
.
     
<EOS>
Nay
,
start
not
,
Signior
;
Manuel
be
actually
that
traitor
:
this
be
the
turn
of
his
revenge
;
when
he
find
himself
disappoint
in
the
hope
of
possess
the
incomparable
Serafina
,
he
take
a
base
advantage
of
your
absence
and
retreat
.
 
<EOS>
He
post
to
Madrid
,
impeach
you
to
the
secretary
of
state
,
of
have
maintain
a
criminal
correspondence
with
the
enemy
of
Spain
,
include
me
in
his
accusation
,
as
a
spy
for
the
house
of
Austria
,
and
frame
such
a
plausible
tale
from
the
circumstance
of
your
distress
,
that
don
Diego
be
outlaw
,
and
Mendoza
gratify
with
a
grant
of
his
estate
.
    
<EOS>
these
melancholy
incident
make
a
deep
impression
upon
the
mind
of
the
virtuous
Antonia
,
who
,
wave
every
other
consideration
,
would
have
personally
appear
for
the
vindication
of
her
husband
's
honour
,
have
not
we
dissuade
her
from
such
a
rash
undertaking
,
by
demonstrate
her
inability
to
contend
with
such
a
powerful
antagonist
,
and
represent
,
that
her
appearance
would
be
infallibly
attend
with
the
ruin
of
Serafina
,
who
would
certainly
fall
into
the
hand
of
the
villain
to
whom
she
have
be
contract
.
 
<EOS>
We
exhort
her
to
wait
patiently
for
some
happy
revolution
of
fortune
,
and
encourage
her
with
the
hope
of
don
Diego
's
exert
himself
effectually
in
his
own
defence
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
while
our
worthy
landlord
be
suddenly
cut
off
by
death
;
and
his
widow
be
resolve
to
retire
into
her
own
country
,
we
secretly
embark
in
the
same
ship
,
and
arrive
in
England
about
eighteen
month
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Antonia
still
continue
to
pine
over
the
ruin
of
her
house
;
as
she
could
hear
no
tiding
of
don
Diego
,
she
conclude
he
be
dead
,
and
mourn
with
unabate
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
in
vain
I
assure
her
that
soon
as
my
own
affair
should
be
adjust
,
I
would
exert
my
whole
endeavour
to
find
and
succour
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
imagine
that
a
man
of
his
spirit
and
disposition
would
live
so
long
in
obscurity
;
and
her
affliction
derive
new
force
from
the
death
of
the
consul
's
widow
,
with
whom
she
have
live
in
the
most
unbounded
intimacy
and
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
from
that
day
her
health
evidently
decline
:
she
foresee
her
dissolution
,
and
comfort
herself
with
the
hope
of
see
her
husband
and
her
friend
,
in
a
place
where
no
treachery
be
feel
,
and
no
sorrow
be
know
;
confident
of
my
integrity
,
and
the
purity
of
my
love
,
she
in
the
most
pathetic
term
recommend
Serafina
to
my
care
.
     
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
weepest
thou
,
fair
excellence
,
at
the
remembrance
of
that
tender
scene
,
when
the
good
Antonia
,
on
the
bed
of
death
,
join
thy
soft
hand
to
mine
,
and
say
,
"
Renaldo
,
I
bequeath
this
orphan
to
your
love
;
it
be
a
sacred
pledge
,
which
if
you
cherish
with
due
honour
and
regard
,
internal
peace
and
happiness
will
ever
smile
within
your
bosom
:
but
if
you
treat
it
with
indifference

dishonour

neglect

just
heaven
will
punish
your
breath
of
trust

everlasting
disappointment

disquiet

Don
Diego

I
see
you

move

therefore
will
not

on
such
distressful
circumstance

<EOS>
the
excellent
Antonia
exchange
this
life
for
a
more
happy
state
;
and
so
exquisite
be
the
sorrow
of
the
tender

hearted
Serafina
,
as
to
toture
me
with
the
apprehension
that
she
would
not
long
survive
her
pious
mother

how
I
obey
the
injunction

that
depart

can
testify

artful
serpent

mutual
confidence

abuse
our

poison
our
unsuspecting

effect
that
fatal
breach

productive
of
all
the
misery

<EOS>
although
the

generosity
of
Melvile

he
could

wonder
at
this
nobleness
of

there
be
nothing
remarkable
in
the
habit
of

to
the

<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
thank
them
for
their
courtesy
,
which
he
do
not
think
proper
to
refuse
,
and
while
he
lead
,
or
rather
haul
mademoiselle
over
the
way
,
under
the
auspex
of
the
Castilian
,
Renaldo
set
the

at
liberty

make
him
a
tender
of
his
good
office

and
advise
him
to
wait
at
the
public
house
for

happy
issue

<EOS>
the
pseudo

parson
be
very
much
affect
by
this
generous
proffer
,
for
which
he
make
suitable
acknowledgment
,
and
protest
before
God
,
he
would
die
a
thousand
death
,
rather
than
part
with
his
dear
Charlotte
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
no
sooner
enter
the
apartment
,
than
he
be
know
by
Joshua
to
be
a
considerable
trader
in
the
city
of
London
,
and
the
merchant
be
glad
to
find
himself
among
his
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
so
full
of
the
story
which
have
bring
him
thither
,
that
he
have
scarce
sit
down
,
when
he
begin
to
complain
of
his
hard
fate
,
in
have
an
only
child
,
who
be
so
mean
,
stubborn
and
contumacious
;
and
every
sentence
be
conclude
with
an
apostrophe
of
reproach
to
the
delinquent

<EOS>
the
Jew
have
allow
him
to
ring
out
his
alarm
,
condole
his
misfortune
,
and
gravely
counsel
the
young
lady
to
wean
her
affection
from
such
an
unworthy
object
;
for
he
suppose
her
favourite
<EOS>
be
a
man
of
no
principle
,
or
liberal
endowment
<EOS>
,
otherwise
her
father
would
not
exclaim
so
bitterly
against
her
conduct
.
    
<EOS>
Charlotte
,
who
want
neither
beauty
,
nor
understanding
,
assure
him
,
that
her
lover
's
character
be
,
in
all
respect
,
unblemishe
:
for
the
truth
of
which
assertion
<EOS>
she
appeal
to
her
papa
,
who
own
,
with
reluctance
,
that
the
young
man
be
a
gentleman
by
birth
,
that
he
have
serve
him
with
remarkable
diligence
and
integrity
,
and
that
his
accomplishment
be
far
superior
to
his
station
in
life
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
then
,
say
he
,
the
fellow
have
not
a
shilling
of
his
own
,
and
would
you
have
me
give
away
my
daughter
to
a
beggar
?

<EOS>
"
God
forbid
!
<EOS>
cry
the
Jew
<EOS>
,
I
always
understand
you
possess
an
ample
fortune

be
sorry
to
find
it
otherwise
.
"
 
<EOS>
otherwise
!
reply
the
citizen
,
with
some
ceremony
,
take
care
what
you
say
,
Sir
,
a
merchant
's
credit
be
not
to
be
tamper
with
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
answer
the
Hebrew
,
I
conclude
that
your
circumstance
be
bad
,
because
you
object
to
the
poverty
of
the
young
man
,
after
you
have
own
he
be
possess
of
every
other
qualification
to
make
your
daughter
happy
;
for
it
be
not
to
be
imagine
,
that
you
would
thwart
her
inclination
,
or
seek
to
render
an
only
child
miserable
,
on
account
of
an
obstacle
which
you
yourself
could
easily
remove
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
suppose
you
can
afford
to
give
with
your
daughter
ten
thousand
pound
,
which
would
enable
this
young
man
to
live
with
credit
and
reputation
,
and
engage
advantageously
in
trade
,
for
which
you
say
he
be
well
qualified
:
    
<EOS>
the
alternatve
then
will
be
,
whether
you
would
rather
see
her
in
the
arm
of
a
deserve
youth
,
whom
she
love
,
enjoy
all
the
comfort
of
life
,
with
a
moderate
fortune
,
which
it
will
always
be
in
your
own
power
to
improve
:
or
tie
for
life
to
a
monied
man
,
whom
she
detest
,
curse
her
hard
fate
,
and
despise
that
superfluity
of
wealth
,
in
spite
of
which
she
find
herself
so
truly
wretched
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
seem
to
be
startle
at
this
observation
,
which
be
reinforce
by
Renaldo
's
saying
,
that
he
would
,
moreover
,
enjoy
the
unutterable
pleasure
of
give
happiness
to
a
worthy

whose
gratitude

co

operate
with
his

in
approve
himself
a
dutiful
son

as
well

He
then
represent
the
family
disquiet
,
and
dismal
tragedy
,
produce
from
such
mercenary
and
compulsive
match
;
and
in
conclusion
relate
the
story
of
don
Diego
and
his
daughter
,
which
when
the
merchant
hear
,
he
start
up
with
mark
of
terror
in
his
countenance
,
and
throw
up
the
casement
,
call
upon
Valentine

great
vociferation

<EOS>
the

be
transport

exquisite
joy
at

sudden
determination
in

<EOS>
Valentine
have

while

and
madame
Clement
caress
the
amiable
Charlotte
,
the
rest
of
the
company
congratulate
her
admirer
upon
his
choice

<EOS>
Valentine
heartily
ask
pardon

give
such
cause
of
offence

and
hope
he
should
be

it

necessary

the
execution

He

,
at

unfold
the
mystery
of
the
hearse

by
give
them
to
understand

that
Charlotte

convey
his

house
in

neighbourhood
of
London

in

they
have
concert
the
expedient

which
he
provide
and
conduct
through

<EOS>
Valentine
think
himself
sufficiently
screen
from
discovery
by
his

but
he
be
unfortunately

<EOS>
He
have
<EOS>
scarce
finish
this
short
relation
,
when
his
rival
bluntly
enter
the
apartment
,
with

tie

a
common
inflammation

to
malice
aforethought

entirely
to
the
precipitate
passion
of
an
incensed
young
man

who
,
by
the

,
act
in
his
own
defence

<EOS>
at

though
he
condole
himself
with
the
hope
of
be
a
gainer
by
the
loss
of
his

and
now
the
pain
be
over
,
would
have
be
very
sorry
to
find
his
sight

<EOS>
the
old

,
Joshua

<EOS>
after

by

<EOS>
Valentine

the
honour
to
dance
with
the
incomparable
Serafina
,
whose
beauty
and
attraction
dazzle
the
eye
of
the
new

and
strike
her
bashful
partner
with
awe

confusion
;
and
Melvile
present
his

to
the
agreeable

who
perform
so

he
praise
God

the
young

;
after

appointeed
a
day
for
the
ceremony

and
invite
all

<EOS>
the
evening
have
be
insensibly
consume
in
these
avocation
,
and
the
night
pretty
far
advanced
,
the
lady
withdraw
without
ceremony
;
and
the
retreat
of
Serafina
fill
Renaldo
's
breast
with
tumult
and
emotion
:
his
blood
begin
to
flow
in
impetuous
tide
,
his
heart
to
beat
with
redouble
vigour
and
velocity
,
while
his
eye
seem
to
flash
with
more
than
human
splendor
:
now
his
imagination
begin
to
anticipate
with
the
enthusiastic
rage
of
an
inspired
Sybil
;
he
be
instantaneously
transport
from
the
conversation
,
and
every
nerve
be
brace
to
such
a
degree
of
impatience
,
that
human
nature
could
not
long
endure
the
tension
.
    
<EOS>
He
therefore
,
have
withstand
the
impulse
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
at
length
give
way
to
his
impetuosity
,
and
spring
from
his
friend
,
find
himself
in
a
dark
passage
,
at
the
farther
end
of
which
he
perceive
madame
Clement
comnig
out
of
a
chamber
with
a
light
,
which
at
sight
of
him
she
set
down
,
and
vanish
in
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
star
that
point
to
his
paradise
:
he
hail
the
signal
,
enter
the
apartment
,
and
like
a
lion
rush
on
his
prey
,
approach
the
nuptial
bed
,
where
Serafina
,
surround
by
all
the
grace
of
beauty
,
softness
,
sentiment
,
and
truth
,
lie
tremble
as
a
victim
at
the
altar
,
and
strove
to
hide
her
blush
from
his
view
;
the
door
be
shut
,
the
light
extinguish

he
own
his
lot
be
more
than
mortal
man
could
claim
.
    
<EOS>
here
let
me
draw
the
decent
veil
,
<EOS>
that
ought
to
shade
the
sacred
mystery
of
Hyman

away
unhallowed

these

<EOS>
the
thought
of
Renaldo
's
felicity
throw
a
damp
on
the
spirit
of
Valentine
,
who
see
the
term
of
his
probation
protract
a
few
day
longer
,
and
could
not
help
wish
in
his
heart
,
that
he
have
atchieve
the
adventure
which
would
have
abridge
his
expectation
,

<EOS>
He
fill
a
bumper
to
the
health
of
the

and
throw
up
his

of
admiration

exclaim

"
how
happy

<EOS>
alas

"
It
be

reasonable

you

say
the
merchant
,
who
do
him
justice
in
the
glass

counsel
him
to
drown
his
impatience
with
good
claret

<EOS>
the
youth
follow
his
advice

and
it
be
late
before
the
company
retire
to
rest

<EOS>
these
citizen
,
however
,
resolve
to
seize
an
opportunity
of
rally
the
new
married
couple
,
accord
to
custom
,
and
with
that
view
arise
early
in
the
morning
,
on
the
supposition
of
find
them
still
asleep

but
they
be
not
a
little
surprized

when
they
enter
the
breakfasting
room

to
see
Renaldo

his
amiable
bedfellow

already
dress
,
and
wait

<EOS>
the
old

would
fain
have
crack
a
joke
upon
their
extraordinary
dispatch
,
but
he
be
so
much
over

awe
by
the
dignity
,
and
tame
by
the
sweetness
of
Serafina
's
carriage
,
that
he
durst
not
give
utterance
to
his
conception
;
and
Valentine
stand
silent
and
abash
,
as
in
the
presence
of
a
superior
being
.
 
<EOS>
after
breakfast
,
these

the
nature
of
this
visit
have
soften
every

they
walk
in
solemn
silence
to
the

in

she
discover
a
regularity

a
delicacy

which
do
not

after

short
pause

declare
he
would
go
in
,
not
with
a
view
to
exult
over
his
misery

in
order
to
contemplate
the
catastrophe
of
such
a
wicked
life
,
that
the

may
be
the
more
deeply
engrave

dismal
apartment

altogether
void

where
they
beheld
the
wretched
hero

stretch
almost
naked
upon
straw

insensible

convulsed

seemingly
in

He
be
wear
to
the
bone
either
by
famine

his

be
overshadow
with

filth

his

be
sink

glaze

distort

his
nostril
dilate

his
lip
cover
with
a
black
slough
,
and
his
complexion
fade
into
a
pale
clay
-
colour
,
tend
to
a
yellow
hue
:
in
a
word
,
the
extremity
of
indigence
,
squalor
and
distress
,
could
not
be
more
feelingly
represent
.
    
<EOS>
while
Melvile
peruse
this
melancholly
lesson
,
and
groaning
,
cry
,
"

he
have
keep
in

he
draw
near
the

be
not
a

surprized
to
see
it
address
to
the
right
honourable
Renaldo

to
the
care
of
Mr

that
before

could
recollect
herself
,
Melvile
have
open
the
billet

read
these
word
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
this
paper
should
fall
into
the
hand
of
the
noble
Renaldo
,
he
will
understand
that
Fathom
be
the
most
execrable
traitor
that
ever
impose
upon
unsuspecting
benevolence
,
or
attempt
to
betray
a
generous
benefactor
.
 
<EOS>
His
whole
life
be
a
series
of
fraud
,
perfidy
,
and
the
most
abominable
ingratitude

of
all
the
crime
that
lie
heavy
upon

soul
,
his
be
accessory
to
the
death
of

incomparable

for
which
he
despair
of
heaven
's
forgiveness
,
notwithstanding
the
dreadful
compunction
and
remorse
which
have
long
prey
upon
his
heart
,
together
with
the
incredible
misery
and
deplorable
death
which
by
this
time
he
hath
undergone
.
 
<EOS>
Tho
'
these
suffering
and
sorrow
can
not
attone
for
his
enormous
guilt
,
perhaps
they
will
excite
the
compassion
of
the
humane
count
de
Melvile
:
at
least
,
this
confession
which
my
conscience
dictate
under
all
the
terror
of
death
and
futurity
,
may
be
a
warning
for
him
to
avoid
henceforth
a
smile
villain
,
like
the
execrable
Fathom

upon
whose
miserable
soul

<EOS>
Renaldo
be
deeply
affect
with
the
content
of
this
scroll
,
which
denote
such
horror
and
despair

<EOS>
He
see
there
could
be
no
dissimilation
of
sinister
design
in
this
profession
of
penitence

he
behold
the
condition
of
the
writer

which
put
all
his
humane
passion
in
commotion

so
that
he
remember
nothing
of
Fathom
but
his
present
distress

<EOS>
He
could
scarce
contain
those
indication
which
may
have
be
justly
deem
the
effect
of
weakness
and
infirmity
;
and
have
desire
the
physician
and
clergyman
to
contribute
their
assistance
for
the
benefit
of
that
wretch

soul
and
body

to
the
coach

and
communicate
the
letter
to
the
lady
;
at
the
same
time
draw
a
picture
of
the
object
he
have
see
,
which
bring
tear
into
the
eye
of
the
gentle
Serafina
,
who
earnestly
entreat
her
lord
to
use
his
endeavour
for
the
relief
and
recovery
of
the
unhappy
man
;
that
he
may
,
if
possible
,
live
to
enjoy
the
benefit
of
mature
repentance
,
and
not
die
in
that
dreadful
despair
which
he
manifest
in
the
letter
.
    
<EOS>
Renaldo
return
to
the
house
,
find
the
pious
clergyman
reading
prayer
with
great
fervency
;
while
don
Diego
stand
with
his
right
hand
upon
his
breast
,
look
stedfastly
upon
the
agonizing
Fathom
,
and
the
young
woman
kneel
with
her
streaming
eye
lift
up
to
heaven
,
in
an
extacy
of
grief
and
devotion
:
the
physician
have
run
to
an
apothecary
's
shop
in
the
neighbourhood
,
from
whence
he
soon
return
with
an
assistant
,
who
apply
a
large
blister
to
the
back
of
the
miserable
patient
,
while
the
female
,
by
the
doctor
's
direction
,
moisten
his
mouth
with
a
cordial
which
he
have
prescribe
.
    
<EOS>
these
charitable

to
procure
a

into
it
,
after
he
have
be
shift
,
and
in
some
measure

from
the
dreg
of
his
indigence

<EOS>
during
this
transaction
the
lady
be
conduct
to
a
tavern
not
far
off
,
where
dinner
be
bespoke
,
that
they
may
be
at
hand
to
see
the
effect
of
their
charity
;
which
be
not
confine
to
what
we
have
already
describe

but
extend
so
far
,
that
in
a
little
time
,
the
apartment

the
young
creature
provide
with
change
of
apparel

and
money
to

the
necessary
of

<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
their
care
,
the
wretched
Fathom
still
remain
insensible
,
and
the
doctor
pronounce
a
very
unfavourable
prognostic
,

order
a
pair
of
additional

to

lay
upon
his

the
threshold
,
the
weep
female
fall
at
her
foot
,
and
kiss
her
robe
,
exclaim
,
"

"
    
<EOS>
the
alteration
in
her
dress
have
make
a
very
agreeable
change
in
her
appearance
,
so
that
the
countess
could
now
look
upon
her
,
without
shudder
at
her
distress
:
and
as
Fathom
be
not
in
a
condition
to
be
disturb
,
she
take
this
opportunity
of
inquire
by
what
step
that

she
know

and
by
what
occurrence
he
have
find
a
wife
in
such
an
abyss
of
misfortune

<EOS>
here
the
other
's
tear
begin
to
flow
afresh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
ashamed
(
say
she
)
to
reveal
my
own
folly
;
yet
I
dare
not
refuse
a
satisfaction
of
this
kind
,
to
a
person

have
lay
me
under
such
signal
obligation

"
    
<EOS>
She
then
proceed
to
relate
her
story
,
by
which
it
appear
,
she
be
no
other
than
the
fair
and
unhappy
Elinor
,
whom
the
artful
Fathom
have
debauch
upon
his
first
arrival
in
town
,
in
the
manner
already
describe

Heaven

pleased
to
restore
the
use
of
my
reason

I
have
lose
,
when
I
find
myself
abandon
by
the
count

but
,
all
my
connexion
with
my
own
family
be
entirely
cut
off
,
and
every
door
shut
against
a
poor
creature
,
who
could
procure
no
recommendation
,
except
the
certificate
sign
by
the
physician
of
bedlam
,
which
instead
of
introduce
me
to
service
,
be
an
unsurmountable
objection
to
my
character
:
 
<EOS>
I
find
myself
destitute
of
all
mean
of

unless
I
would
condescend

impure
confession

my
guilt

which
heaven
know

I
then
do

now
do
look
upon
with
abhorrence
and
detestation

<EOS>
I
have
already
forfeit
my
innocence
,
and
want
resolution
to
encounter
misery
and
death

<EOS>
nevertheless
,
before
I
could
determine
to
embrace
the
condition
of
a
prostitute
,
I
be
one
day
accost
in
the
park
by
an
elderly
gentleman
who
sit
down
by
me
upon
a
bench
,
and
take
notice

press
me
to
make
him
acquaint

so
much
sympathy

appear
in

conversation

that
I
gratify
his

he
,
in

save
me
from

most
horrible
part

by
take
me
into
his

reserve
me
for

in
this
situation
I
live
a

year
,
until
I
be
deprive
of
my
keeper
by
an
apoplectic
fit
,
and
turn
out

who
do
not

<EOS>
far
from
be
as
yet
reconcile
to
a

I
resolve
to
renounce
the
path
of
shame

and
convert
my
effect
into
ready
money
,
hire
a
small
shop
,

furnish
it
with
haberdashery
ware

intend
to
earn
an
honest
livelihood
by
the
sale
of

together
with
the
plain

work

I
hope
to
be
employ
,
so
soon
as
my

should
be
know

this
scheme
do
not
answer

the
good
spoil
upon

as
I
be
a
stranger

no

would
intrust
me

so
that
notwithstanding
the

oeconomy

I
run
in

seize

take
out

,
where
I
find
my
first
seducer
.
 
<EOS>
Good
heaven
!
<EOS>
what
do
I
feel
at
this
unexpected
meeting
,
overwhelmed
as
I
be
before
,
with
my
own
distress
!
 
<EOS>
I
with
a
loud
scream
faint
away
;
and
when
I
recover
,
find
myself
in
the
arm
of
Mr
Fathom
,
who
weep
over
me
with
great
affliction
.
 
<EOS>
all
his
prospect
of
gaiety
have
now
vanish
,
and
his
heart
be
soften
by
his
own
misfortune
,
to
a
feeling
of
another
's
woe
,
as
well
as
to
a
due
sense
of
his
own
guilt
.
 
<EOS>
He
express
the
deep
sorrow
for
have
be
the
occasion
of
my
ruin
,
endeavour'd
to
comfort
me
with
promise
of
assistance
,
and
indeed
,
by
practise
medicine
among
the
prisoner
,
make
shift
to
keep
us
both
from
starve
.
 
<EOS>
but
surely
no
sinner
undergo
such
severe
remorse
,
as
that
which
he
suffer
during
his
imprisonment
.
    
<EOS>
from
the
day
of
our
meeting
,
I
never
once
see
him
smile
:
a
melancholy
cloud
continually
overhang
his
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
He
number
the
minute
by
his
groan
,
he
use
to
start
with
horrour
from
his
sleep
,
and
strike
his
breast
,
would
exclaim
,
"
O
Elinor
!
<EOS>
I
be
the
bad
of
villain
!
"
 
<EOS>
sometimes
he
seem
disorder
in
his
brain
,
and
rave
about
Renaldo
and
Monimia
:
in
a
word
,
his
mind
be
in
a
dreadful
situation
,
and
all
his
agony
be
communicate
to
me
,
whom
by
this
time
he
have
marry
,
in
order
to
make
some
attonement
for
my
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
Wretched
as
he
then
be
,
I
remember
the
accomplished
youth
who
have
captivate
my
virgin
heart
:
 
<EOS>
the
old
impression
still
remain
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
his
penitence
,
pity
his
misfortune
:
and
his
wife
be
dead
,
consent
to
join
his
fate
,
the
ceremony
have
be
perform
by
a
fellow
-
prisoner
,
who
be
in
order
.
 
<EOS>
though
his
hard
-
hearted
creditor
have
no
other
chance
of
be
pay
,
than
that
of
set
him
at
liberty
,
he
lend
a
deaf
ear
to
all
our
supplication
;
and
his
cruelty
conspire
with
the
anguish
of
my
husband
's
own
reflection
,
affect
his
health
and
spirit
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
could
no
longer
earn
the
miserable
pittance
which
have
hitherto
support
our
life
.
 
<EOS>
then
our
calamity
begin
to
multiply
.
 
<EOS>
Indigence
and
famine
stare
us
in
the
face
;
and
it
be
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
we
resist
their
attack
by
sell
or
pledge
our
wear
apparel
,
until
we
be
leave
almost
quite
naked
,
when
we
find
ourselves
discharge
by
an
act
pass
for
the
relief
of
insolvent
debtor
.
    
<EOS>
this
charitable
law
,
which
be
intend
for
a
consolation
to
the
wretched
,
prove
to
us
the
most
sever
disaster
:
for
,
we
be
turn
out
into
the
street
,
utterly
distitute
of
food
,
raiment
and
lodging
;
at
a
time
when
Mr
Fathom
be
so
weaken
by
his
destemper
,
that
he
could
not
stand
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
support
him
from
door
to
door
,
implore
the
compassion
of
charitable
christians
,
and
be
as
length
permit
to
shelter
him
in
this
miserable
place
,
where
his
disease
gain
ground
<EOS>
,
he
lie
three
day
in
that
deplorable
condition
,
from
which
he
hath
now
be
rescue
(
tho
'
I
fear
too
late
)
by
your
humanity
and
benevolence
.
"
    
<EOS>
She
shed
a
flood
of
tear
at
the
conclusion
of
this
mournful
tale
,
which
do
not
fail
to
affect
the
whole
audience
,
especially
Serafina
,
who
assure
her
,
that
whatever
should
happen
to
her
husband
,
she
may
depend
upon
find
favour
and
protection
,
provide
her
conduct
should
correspond
with
her
profession
.
 
<EOS>
while
this
grateful
creature
kiss
the
hand
of
her
kind
benefactress
,
Fathom
utter
a
groan
,
begin
to
stir
in
the
bed
,
and
with
a
languid
voice
call
upon
Elinor
,
who
instantly
withdraw
the
curtain
,
present
the
whole
company
to
his
view
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
now
retrieve
the
use
of
his
perception
,
by
the
operation
of
the
blister
which
begin
to
torture
him
severely
;
he
look
around
him
with
amazement
and
affright
,
and
distinguish
the
three
person
against
whom
the
chief
arrow
of
his
fraud
and
treachery
have
be
level
,
he
conclude
that
he
be
now
arrive
at
the
land
of
depart
soul
,
and
that
the
shade
of
those
whom
he
have
so
grievously
injure
,
be
come
to
see
him
torment
accord
to
his
demerit
.
    
<EOS>
Fraught
with
this
notion
,
which
be
confirm
by
the
bodily
pain
which
he
feel
,
and
the
appearance
of
the
clergyman
and
Joshua
whom
he
mistake
for
the
minister
of
vengeance
,
he
cry
in
a
tone
replete
with
horror
,
"
be
there
no
mercy
then
for
penitence
!
<EOS>
be
there
no
pity
due
to
the
misery
I
suffer
upon
earth
!
<EOS>
save
me
,
o
bountiful
heaven
!
<EOS>
from
the
terror
of
everlasting
woe
;
hide
me
from
these
dreadful
executioner
,
whose
look
be
torture
:
forgive
me
,
generous
Castilian
.
 
<EOS>
o
Renaldo
!
<EOS>
thou
hadst
once
a
tender
heart
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
not
lift
my
eye
to
Serafina
!
<EOS>
that
pattern
of
human
excellence
,
who
fall
a
victim
to
my
attrocious
guilt
;
yet
,
her
aspect
be
all
mildness
and
compassion

<EOS>
ha
!
be
not
these
the
drop
of
pity
?
<EOS>
yes
,
they
be
tear
of
mercy
:
they
fall
like
refresh
shower
upon
my
drooping
soul

<EOS>
ah
murthere
innocence
!
<EOS>
wilt
thou
not
intercede
for
thy
betrayer
at
the
throne
of
grace
!
"
    
<EOS>
here
he
be
interrupt
by
Melvile
,
who
with
a
grave
and
solemn
air
,
pronounce
,
"
great
hath
be
thy
guilt
,
<EOS>
unhappy
Ferdinand
,
and
great
have
be
thy
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
we
come
not
to
insult
,
but
to
alleviate
thy
distress
.
 
<EOS>
Providence
hath
kindly
defeat
thy
dire
intention
,
which
we
therefore
now
forgive
and
transmit
to
oblivion
,
whether
it
be
thy
lot
to
yield
up
thy
spirit
immediately
,
or
to
survive
the
dangerous
malady
with
which
thou
art
at
at
present
overwhelm
.
 
<EOS>
suffer
not
thyself
to
despair
;
for
the
mercy
of
heaven
be
infinite
;
and
submit
to
the
direction
of
this
worthy
gentleman
who
will
employ
his
skill
for
thy
recovery
,
while
we
shall
take
care
to
furnish
thee
with
necessary
attendance
:
as
too
much
speak
may
be
prejudicial
to
thy
health
<EOS>
,
I
dispense
with
a
reply
,
and
exhort
thee
to
compose
thyself
to
rest
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
draw
the
curtain
,
and
the
company
retire
,
leave
Fathom
intrance
with
wonder
.
    
<EOS>
the
next
step
which
Renaldo
take
for
the
benefit
of
this
wretched
penitent
,
be
to
send
for
the
apothecary
with
whom
he
leave
a
sum
of
money
to
be
expend
for
the
convenience
of
Fathom
and
his
wife
;
then
he
lay
injunction
upon
the
physician
to
repeat
his
visit
;
and
that
gentleman
,
together
with
the
clergyman
and
Joshua
,
take
leave
of
the
other
till
next
day
<EOS>
,
the
count
set
out
with
the
lady
and
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
to
the
house
where
they
have
lodge
the
precede
night
.
    
<EOS>
the
reader
may
well
imagine
the
conversation
of
the
evening
turn
wholly
upon
the
strange
occurrence
of
the
day
,
which
seem
to
have
be
concert
by
supernatural
prescience
,
in
order
to
satisfy
the
vengeance
,
and
afford
matter
of
triumph
to
the
generosity
of
those
who
have
be
so
grievously
injure
by
the
guilty
Fathom
.
 
<EOS>
tho
'
not
one
of
them
would
say
that
such
a
miscreant
ought
to
live
;
yet
all
concur
in
approve
the
office
of
humanity
which
have
be
perform
,
and
even
endeavour
to
find
specious
pretext
for
vindicate
their
compassion
.
 
<EOS>
Don
Diego
say
it
would
ill
become
a
transgressor
like
him
,
to
with
-
hold
his
forgiveness
from
a
sinner
who
have
wrong'd
him
:
 
<EOS>
Madame
Clement
appeal
to
the
approbation
of
heaven
,
which
have
undoubtedly
direct
them
that
way
,
for
the
purpose
they
have
fulfil
;
Serafina
observe
that
the
crime
of
the
delinquent
be
obliterate
by
his
sorrow
,
misery
and
repentance
:
 
<EOS>
Renaldo
honestly
own
,
that
,
exclusive
of
other
reason
,
he
could
not
deny
himself
the
luxurious
enjoyment
of
communicate
happiness
to
his
fellow
creature
in
distress
;
and
each
fervently
pray
that
their
charity
may
not
be
disappoint
by
the
death
of
the
object
.
    
<EOS>
while
they
amuse
themselves
in
these
discussion
,
Fathom
,
after
have
lain
some
hour
silent
,
in
consequence
of
Renaldo
's
advice
,
could
no
longer
suppress
the
astonishment
of
his
mind
,
but
,
address
himself
to
his
wife
,
"
O
Elinor
!
<EOS>
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
my
delirium
be
now
past
:
tho
'
I
still
remember
the
phantasy
of
my
distemper'd
brain
:
among
other
reverie
,
my
imagination
be
regale
with
a
vision
so
perfect
and
distinct
,
as
to
emulate
truth
and
reality
.
 
<EOS>
Methought
count
de
Melvil
,
don
Diego
de
Zelos
,
and
the
divine
Serafina
,
the
very
person
who
be
now
cry
before
the
throne
of
heaven
for
vengeance
against
the
guilty
Fathom
,
stand
by
my
bed
-
side
,
with
look
of
pity
and
forgiveness
;
and
that
Renaldo
speak
peace
to
my
despairing
soul
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
the
word
distinctly
:
 
<EOS>
I
retain
them
in
my
memory
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
tear
trickle
from
Serafina
's
eye
:
 
<EOS>
I
hear
her
father
utter
a
compassionate
sigh
;
and
should
actually
believe
that
they
be
personally
present
<EOS>
,
have
not
I
long
ago
see
with
my
own
eye
,
the
funeral
procession
of
that
young
lady
whose
wrong
God
pardon
;
and
be
I
not
convinced
that
such
a
meeting
could
not
be
effect
without
the
immediate
and
miraculous
interposition
of
heaven
.
 
<EOS>
yet
every
thing
I
now
see
,
correspond
with
the
word
of
Renaldo
,
which
still
sound
in
my
ear
.
 
<EOS>
when
my
perception
forsook
me
,
I
lie
in
the
most
abject
misery
,
among
straw
;
and
thou
,
poor
injure
innocence
,
wast
naked
and
forlorn
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
I
find
myself
repose
in
a
warm
easy
comfortable
bed
:
 
<EOS>
I
see
around
me
the
mark
of
human
charity
and
care
,
and
the
favourable
change
in
thy
appearance
glad
my
poor
dejected
heart
.
 
<EOS>
say
,
whence
this
happy
alteration
?
    
<EOS>
do
I
really
wake
from
that
dream
of
misery
in
which
we
have
continue
so
long
?
<EOS>
or
do
still
utter
the
extravagant
raving
of
a
distemper'd
brain
?
"
    
<EOS>
Elinor
be
afraid
of
impart
at
once
all
the
particular
of
the
happy
change
he
have
undergo
,
lest
they
may
leave
a
dangerous
impression
upon
his
fancy
,
which
be
not
yet
duly
compose
:
she
content
herself
,
therefore
,
with
tell
him
that
he
have
be
oblige
to
the
humanity
of
a
gentleman
and
lady
,
who
chance
to
pass
that
way
by
accident
,
and
who
,
understand
his
deplorable
case
,
have
furnish
him
with
the
conveniencie
which
he
now
enjoy
:
she
then
present
to
him
,
what
the
doctor
have
direct
her
to
administer
,
and
admonish
him
to
commit
his
head
to
the
pillow

he
be
favour
with
a
breathing
sweat
,
fall
fast
asleep
,
and
in
a
few
hour
wake
again
altogether
cool
and
undisturbed
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
upon
this
occasion
that
his
wife
explain
the
circumstance
of
that
visit
which
have
redeem
him
from
extremity
of
wretchedness
and
the
jaw
of
death
;
upon
which
,
he
start
up
,
and
throw
himself
upon
his

exclaim
,
"
all

Thou

thy

<EOS>
how
shall
I
requite
their
generosity

o
I

let
me
not

until
I
shall

them
of
my
reformation

and
see
them
enjoy
that
felicity
which
ought

such
consummate
virtue

"
    
<EOS>
next
day
in
the
forenoon
,
he
be
visit
by
the
physician
,
whom
he
now
recollect
to
have
see
at
the
house
of
madame
Clement
;
and
after
have
thank
that
gentleman
for
his
humanity
and
care
,
he
earnestly
beg
to
know
by
what
mean
Serafina
have
be

.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
satisfied
in
this
particular
,
and
give
to
understand
that
she
be
now
happy
in
the
arm
of
Renaldo

"
bless

<EOS>
(
he
cry
)
for
have
defeat
the
villainy
of
him
who
seek
to
part
such
lover
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
Sir
,
will
you
add
one
circumstance
to
your
charity
,
and
bear
to
that
happy
couple
and
the
noble
don
Diego
,
the
respect
and
the
remorse
of
a
sincere
penitent
,
whom
their
compassion
hath
raise
to
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
such
a
traitor
to
them
,
that
my
word
deserve
no
regard
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
therefore
use
profession
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
not
hope
to
be
admit
into
their
presence
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
indeed
ashamed
to
see
the
light
of
the
sun
:
how
then
could
I
bear
the
look
of
that
injure
family
!
<EOS>
ah
,
no
!
<EOS>
let
me
hide
myself
in
some
obscure
retreat
,
where
I
may
work
out
my
salvation
with
fear
and
tremble
,
and
pray
incessantly
to
heaven
for
their
prosperity
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
physician
promise
to
represent
his
contrition
to
the
count
and
his
lady
,
and
accordingly
proceed
to
their
habitation
,
where
he
repeat
these
expression
,
and
pronounce
his
patient
out
of
danger
;
so
that
their
thought
be
now
employ
in
concert
a
scheme
for
his
future
subsistence
,
that
he
may
not
be
expose
by
indigence
to
a
relapse
in
point
of
moral
.
    
<EOS>
Renaldo
be
still
averse
to
any
personal
intercourse
with
such
a
wretch
,
until
he
should
give
some
undoubted
proof
of
amendment
,
and
as
yet
afraid
of
intrust
him
with
any
office
that
require
integrity
,
resolve
,
with
the
approbation
of
all
present
,
to
settle
him
in
a
cheap
country
in
the
north
of
England
,
where
he
and
his
wife
could
live
comfortably
on
an
annuity
of
sixty
pound
,
until
his
behaviour
should
intitle
him
to
a
well
provision
.
    
<EOS>
this
resolution

while

can
not
render
easy
and
supportable

<EOS>
when
I
revisit
the
castle
of
Zelos

every
well
know
object
will
recal
the
memory
of
my

and
I
shall
want
a
companion
to
fill
her
place

and
to
sympathize
with
me
in
that
sorrow

before

she

"
You

I

as

circumstantially
on

so
as
perhaps
even
to
have
tired

we
shall
not
repeat
the
dialogue
that
pass
,
when
the
Spaniard
be
indulge
with
an
opportunity
to
explain
his
sentiment

<EOS>
suffice
it
to
observe
,
that
the
lady

over

and
that
she
be
too
wise
to
trifle
with
the
time
which
every
moment

more
and
more
precious

<EOS>
It
be
agree
then

that

should
settle
his

in
Spain

in
