of
those

much
about
him
,
none
of
them
be
allow
to
cross
histhreshold
;
but
there
be
an
air
,
even
externally
,
about
his
dwelling
,
strongly
indicative
of
his
parsimonious
character
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
windowsin
the
upper
story
,
which
,
as
be
usual
with
habitation
of
that
date
,
far

board

and
those
not
thus
close
wereso
cover
with
dust
and
dirt
that
it
be
impossible
to
discern
anyobject
through
them
.
<EOS>
many
part
of
the
building
be
in
a
ruinouscondition
,
and
where
the
dilapidation
be
not
dangerous
,
be
leave
inthat
state
;
but
wherever
some
repair
be
absolutely
necessary
to
keepthe
structure
together
,
they
be
make
in
the
readiest
and
cheapestmanner
.
<EOS>
the
porch
alone

its
original
character
.
<EOS>
It
projectedfar
beyond
the
doorway
,
and
be

,
even
in
the
day

time;and
the
whole
building
have
a
dingy

dismal
,
and
dungeon
-
like
aspect
.
<EOS>
Mr

<EOS>
Scarve
's
opposite
neighbour
,
who
be
as
curious
as
oppositeneighbour
generally
be
,
and
who
be
a
mercer
name
Deacle
,
use
tospend
hour
with
his
wife
and
daughter
,
who
be
as
curious
as
himself
,
in
reconnoitre
the
miser
's
dwelling
.
<EOS>
but
their
curiosity
be
rarely
,
if
ever
,
gratify
,
except
by
occasionally
see
some
member
of
thefamily
go
forth
,
or
return
.
<EOS>
another
constant
spy
upon
the
mysteriousabode
be
Peter
Pokerich
,
a
young
barber
and
wig
-
maker
,
occupy
thenext
house
to
the
mercer
,
but
whose
motive
be
not
like
the
other'
,
entirely
those
of
curiosity
.
<EOS>
have
complete
his
apprenticeship
about
atwelvemonth
before
,
Peter
Pokerich
have
at
that
time
settle
in
theLittle
Sanctuary
,
and
have
already
obtain
a
fair
share
of
business
,
be
much
employ
in
dress
the
wig
of
the
lawyer
frequentingwestminster
Hall
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
smart
dapper
little
fellow
,
with
nocontemptible
opinion
of
himself
,
either
as
to
mental
or
personalqualification
,
and
be
determine
to
push
his
fortune
with
the
sex
,
have
,
in
the
first
instance
,
pay
very
marked
attention
to
the
mercer'sdaughter
,
Thomasine
,
or
,
as
she
be
more
familiarly
call
,
Tommy
;
andthese
attention
it
be
pretty
evident
be
not
altogether
unacceptable
.
<EOS>
just
,
however
,
as
he
be
on
the
eve
of
declare
himself
and
solicitingthe
hand
of
the
fair
Thomasine
,
with
little
apprehension
of
a
refusal
,
he
accidentally
behold
the
miser
's
daughter
,
Hilda
Scarve
,
and
hisinflammable
heart
take
fire
at
her
beauty
,
which
be
sufficientlyravishe
to
captivate
a
cold
breast
than
the
barber
's
,
he
thenceforthbecame
her
slave
,
and
could
no
longer
endure
the
auburn
lock
,
the
hazelorbs
,
the
round
cheek
,
and
plump
little
person
,
of
the
fair
Thomasine
,
which
have
once
appear
so
attractive
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
another
considerationwas
not
without
its
weight
in
turn
the
scale
of
his
affection
.
<EOS>
Hilda
's
father
be
repute
to
be
of
immense
wealth
;
she
be
his
onlychild
,
at
least
it
be
generally
understand
to
be
so
,
and
would
,
ofcourse
,
inherit
the
whole
of
his
vast
hoard
;
and
as
,
furthermore
,
hewa
an
old
man
,
it
could
not
,
in
the
course
of
nature
,
be
very
longbefore
the
property
must
come
to
her
.
<EOS>
this
consideration
decide
Peterin
favour
of
the
miser
's
daughter
,
and
it
be
the
hope
of
obtain
aglimpse
of
her
that
make
him
play
the
spy
upon
her
father
's
dwelling
.
<EOS>
the
repair
previously
allude
to
be
make
by
the
miser
's
servant
,
Jacob
Post
,
who
,
on
this
occasion
,
step
over
the
way
to
borrow
aladder
from
Mr.
Deacle
.
<EOS>
for
reason
of
his
own
,

and
wherea

<EOS>
Jacob
be
next

,
and
with
some
hesitation

.

with
cold
beef

him
,
and
he
clear
it
in
an
inconceivably
short
space
oftime
.
<EOS>
the
plate
be
again
fill
,
and
again
empty
,
and
as
his
appetiteseeme
in
no
way

,
and
the

nearly
bare
,
a
largeremnant
of
a

a
brown
earthenware
dish

<EOS>
to
the
astonishment
of
the
party
,
he
soon
dispose
of
it
.
<EOS>
these
viandsrequire
to
be
wash
down

Mr.
Deacle

a
jug
of
ale

which
stoodat
one
corner
of

offer
it
to
his

as
much
as

<EOS>
"
whether

Jacob

the
wink

<EOS>
He
take
the
glass
,
drain
it
to
the
last
drop
,
and
spring
tohis
foot
.
<EOS>
"Why

"
cry
Mr.

.
<EOS>
"yes

gruff
voice

<EOS>
"Well

a
bit
,
I
have
something
to
say
to
you

"
rejoin
Mr

<EOS>
""You
should
have
think
of
that
before

"
remark
Mrs

Deacle
,
somewhat
spitefully
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
would
draw
another
jug
of
ale
,
mydear
,
I
dare
say
Jacob
would
risk
incur
his
master
's
displeasure
,
and
stay
a
few
minute
longer
.
<EOS>
""no
,
I
would
not

"
reply
Jacob
,
look
at
the
same
time
wistfully
atthe
jug
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no

I

not

"
he
add
,
slightly
soften
his
tone
.
<EOS>
"try

"
whisper
Mrs.
Deacle
to
her
spouse
.
<EOS>
Mr

Deacle
take
the
hint
,
and
likewise
take
up
the
jug
,
and
wink

to
a
side

,
open
upon
a
flight

<EOS>
with
true
feminine
tact
,
Mrs.
Deacle
have
perceive
Jacob'sweak

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
the
temptation
of

He

still
higher
up
,
glance
at
the
door
,
but
do
not
attempt
towithdraw
.
<EOS>
the
figure
that
he
now
cut
be
so
ridiculous
that
both
ladiesburst
into
scream
of
laughter
.
<EOS>
not

Jacob
maintain
his
position

with

lookso
stern
that
their

himself
as
erect
as

<EOS>
He

and
an

with
a

He

<EOS>
It

I
clearly
detect

I

it

o'clock

on

after

with

Glad
of

little
extraindulgence
in
repose
,
Trussell
do
not
rise
till
late
,
and
Randulph
wastherefore
leave
to
a
tete
-
a
-
tete
with
his
eld
uncle
.
<EOS>
whether
it
wasthat
Abel
be
in
a
well
humour
than
before
,
or
that
he
be
not
frettedby
<EOS>
Trussell
,
whose
remark
,
however
well
mean
,
generally
seem
toexcite
all
his
cynical
propensity
<EOS>
,
Randulph
could
not
tell
,
but
hecertainly
find
him
more
agreeable
than
he
have
previously
think
him
.
<EOS>
Abel
question
his
nephew
narrowly
as
to
his
taste
and
pursuit
,
andseeme
pleased
with
the
answer
he

soprosperously
that
Mr.

a
fine
Westphalia

atthe
well
spread
sideboard
,
suspend
his
operation
to
rub
his
handswith
delight
.
<EOS>
Abel
notice
his
exhilaration
,
and
guess
the
cause
,
could
not
refrain
from
smile
,
and
Randulph
think
he
have
never
seenso
pleasant
a
smile
before
.
<EOS>
Abel
's
heart
indeed
,
it
be
evident
,
waswarme
towards
his
nephew
;
and
he
make
no
attempt
to
check
the
kindlyfeeling
.
<EOS>
He
descant
with
much
force
and
truth
,
on
the
danger
to
whicha
young
man
must
be
expose
on
his
first
entrance
into
the
world
,
butexhibite
far
less
straightlacedness
than
may
have
be
expect
.
<EOS>
headvise
his
nephew
to
mix
with
society
,
but
not
to
become
a
part
of
it;to
use
,
but
not
abuse
,
the
advantage
nature
have
give
him
;
and
to
pushhis
fortune
to
the
utmost
;
display
throughout
the
whole
discourse
,
ashrewdness
of
observation
,
a
nice
perception
of
character
,
and
aknowledge
of
the
world
,
for
which
Randulph
have
not
give
him
credit
,
andwhich
raise
him
materially
in
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
on
one
point
only
,
the
youngman
think
him
guilty
of
injustice
--
namely
,
in
the
bitter
anddisparaging
view
he
take
of
woman
.
<EOS>
on
this
head
,
therefore
,
he
venturedto
differ
with
him
,
and
his
zeal
and
earnestness
appear
to
interestAbel
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
do
,
the
old
man
shrug
his
shoulder
,
andcontente
himself
with
say
,
"
You
will
think
differently
,
one
day
.
<EOS>
"Randulph
would
have
reply
,
but
a
plate
of
ham
from
Mr.
Jukes
,
accompany
by
a
significant
look
from
the
discreet
butler
,
warn
himnot
to
pursue
the
subject
further
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,

silent

the
only
part
of
his
attire
which
appear
to
be
neglectedwas
his
peruke
,
and
this
do
not

Abel
's
attention
,
as
he

contemptuously
from
head
to
foot
.
<EOS>
"It

I
have
not

I
have
little

in
tone
so
loud

sostrong

he

weak
enough

<EOS>
It
must
be
confess

unwilling
as

to
admitit
--
that
Randulph
be
not
altogether
proof
against
the
undisguisedadmiration
of

rapidly

<EOS>
various
speculation
be
put
forth
as
to
whetherthis
young
female
would
prove
as
pretty
on

in

Randulph
take
little
part

<EOS>
to
speaktruth

run
upon

andhappene
to

this
juncture

one

a
plan

occur
to

by
which
he
hopedto
free
himself
from
risk

and
place
Randulph
,
whom
he
have
reason
toregard
as
a

in

awkward
dilemma

<EOS>
without

he
draw
the

"Randulph

supplant

from
the

who

however
,
sportivelydetaine
him
,
and
,
unable
to
retreat
,
he
cut
a
most
ridiculous
figure
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
be
not
a
little
relieved
,
though
he
feel
how
much
he
shouldsink
in
her
esteem
,
when
he
see
Hilda
bend
forward
,
and
order
Jacob
,
who
continue

on
his

,
to
pass
on

<EOS>
He
continue
gaze
afterthe

till
it
be
out
of

;
but
Hilda
do
not
look
back

<EOS>
meanwhile
,
as
Philip

do
not
make

appearance
,
Kitty

very
impatient
,
and

a
deaf

<EOS>
the
young

couldnot
very
well
refuse
compliance
with
the
request
,
and
he

into
the

withKitty

and
order
the

to

<EOS>
Randulph

tooangry
with

too
indifferent
to
the
fascination
of
thepretty
actress
,
to
return
the
tender
glance
with
which
she

His

He

in
accent
of
despair--"I

look
around

how
the

abel.shortly
after
Hilda

departure
,
Abel
Beechcroft
summon
his
butler
,
and
inform
him
he
be
go
out
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
back
in
time
for
dinner,"he
say
.
<EOS>
"
if
Miss
Scarve
should
call
again
during
my
absence
which
isnot
impossible
,
though
I
think
it
unlikely
,
shew
her
into
the
library;and
take
care
that
Randulph
do
not
see
her
.
<EOS>
""I
be
in
hope
,
sir
,
that
your
interview
with
that
dear
young
ladymight
have
alter
your
view
in
regard
to
your
nephew
,
"
reply
Mr
.
Jukes
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
please
myself
with
the
idea
of
the
nice
wife
she'dmake
<EOS>
Mr.
Randulph
.
<EOS>
They
seem
cut
out
for
each
other
--
just
of
an
age
--
andit
's
difficult
to
say
which
be
the
handsome
.
<EOS>
bless
my
heart
!
<EOS>
if
themarriage
should
take
place
,
what
a
feast
we
should
have
,
and
how
busy
Ishould
be
!
<EOS>
and
then
,
of
course
you
would
have
the
young
folk
to
live
withyou
;
and
you
would
get
so
fond
of
your
new
niece
,
that
you
would
not
bear
herout
of
sight
for
an
instant
,
but
would
be
happy
than
you
have
beenbefore
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
in
due
time
,
you
would
have
to
turn
one
of
the
upper
roomsinto
a
nursery
,
and
I
should
see
you
sit
in
your
easy
chair
,
notwith
a
book
before
you
,
blind
your
eye
,
but
with
young
Master
Crewon
a
rockinghorse
on
one
side
,
and
young
Miss
Crew
on
t'other
,
while
thenurse
would
be
bring
you
a
third
crow
little
bantling
in
longpetticoat
,
encourage
the
growth
of
its
tooth
,
and
cultivate
a
tastefor
music
at
the
same
time
with
a
silver
rattle
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
forbid
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculate
Abel
,
who
have
allow
the
butler
to
rambleon
in
his
own
way
.
"
<EOS>
Your
notion
and
mine
of
domestic
happiness
differmaterially

<EOS>
I
have
always
treat
you
with
great
confidence

Jukes

headde
,
gravely
;

and
I
confess
I
should
be
glad
to
see
Randulph
well
andhappily
married
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
in
no
hurry
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
desirable
heshould
see
something
of
the
world
--
something
more
of
female
society
,
inorder
that
he
may
understand
his
own
taste
well
before
he
take
astep
on
which
the
whole
happiness
or
misery
of
his
life
will
hang
.
<EOS>
it'sa
sad
thing
to
discover
,
when
too
late
,
that
he
have
not
choose
well
.
<EOS>
""It
must
be
rather
disagreeable
,
no
doubt
,
"
rejoin
Mr.
Jukes
;
"
but
idon't
consider
an
old
bachelor
like
you
a
competent
judge
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
however
,
if
Mr.
Randulph
choose
Miss
Hilda
,
he
will
choose
well
,
that
i'mprepare
to
maintain
.
<EOS>
""Jukes
,
"
say
Abel
,
sternly
,
"
it
be
time
to
check
your
loquacity
.
<EOS>
Muchas
<EOS>
I
be
pleased
with
Hilda
Scarve

<EOS>
and
I
assure
you
she
have
win
upon
myaffection
in
an
extraordinary
manner

I
do
not
desire
,
for
reasonswhich
it
be
needless
to
explain
,
that
she
should
become
the
bride
of
mynephew

<EOS>
""i
confess
<EOS>
I
can
not
fathom
your
motive

sir

"
say
Mr.
Jukes;"unless
--
<EOS>

I
should
have
think
you
too
old

""Too

old
for
what

Jukes

Abel

"At

I

I

<EOS>

I
be
sure
I
have
no
objection,--none
on

,
if
you
can
getthe

<EOS>
only
I

there
be
a

much
disparity

that

flush

composure

I

up

Mr

"
I
almost
wish
our
quiet
house
have
not
beendisturbe
by
these
young
people

<EOS>
I
perceive
plainly
that
Randulph
willfall
over
head
and
ear
in
love
with
Hilda
--
if
he
have
not
do
soalready
--
<EOS>
and
then
my
master
will
quarrel
with
him
,
and
then
--
<EOS>
but
no
,
he'ssure
to
pardon
him
,
just
as
I
always
overlook
the
fault
of
my
gracelessnephew
,
Crackenthorpe
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
will
not
do
for
me
to
bring
'em
<EOS>
together;and
<EOS>
I
hope
the
young
lady
may
not
come
back

crowd
ofpassenger

she
seldom

and
she
direct

occasion
thatRandulph

armed
as
he
conceive
himself
against

be
notquite

It
be
quite
evident

Mr

very
great

,
and
indue
himself
in
hismaster

,
lay
claim
also
to
his
master
's
title
;
in
other
word
,
sink
the
vulgar

to
the
eastern
side
of
themetropolis
,
where
he
be
pretty
certain

either

orhis

;
his

place
of

<EOS>
OneSunday

when
he
be
so
disport

at

,
hecontrive
to
strike
up
an
acquaintance
with
a
very
showy
dame
whohappene
to
be
there
,
and
who
be
dazzle
by
his
brilliant
exterior
andairy
manner
--
so
superior
,
she
think
,
to
those
of
the
vulgar
throngaround
her
.
<EOS>
have
attend
her
during
her
stay
,
Mr.

call
acoach
for
her
,
lead
her
to
it
,
and
be
reward
by
a
tender
look
and
atenderer
squeeze
of
the
hand
at
parting
.
<EOS>
He
have
previously
ascertainedthat
the
lady
's
name
be
Nettleship
,
that
she
be
the
relict
of
atallow
-
chandler
,
and
reside
in
Billiter
-
square
;
that
she
possess
ahandsome
property
,
bequeath
to
her
by
her
deceased
spouse
,
thetallow
-
chandler
aforesaid
;
and
moreover
,
that
she
be
withoutincumbrance
.
<EOS>
Fortune
thus
appear
to
have
throw
a
rich
prize
in
hisway
,
if
he
could
but
obtain
it
.
<EOS>
He
find
,
however
,
on
further
inquiry
,
that
Mrs.
Nettleship
be
under
a
marriage
engagement
to
her
latehusband
's
partner
,
Mr.
Rathbone
,
who
be
at
that
time
in
the
countrycollecte
debt
,
and
settle
his
affair
.
<EOS>
but
though
this
circumstancecertainly
appear
untoward
,
he
determine
to
persevere
,
be
firmlypersuade
that
in
love
matter
to
dare
be
generally
to
succeed
.
<EOS>
withthis
view
,
he
contrive
to
meet
Mrs.
Nettleship
as
often
as
he
could
,
and
have
be
exactly
half
a
dozen
time
in
her
company
prior
to
theopening
of
this
history
,
during
which
period
be
contrive
to
heightenthe
agreeable
impression
he
have
produce
on
their
first
acquaintance
,
and
in
a
great
degree
to
obliterate
the
image
of
Mr.
Rathbone
.
<EOS>
Mrs
.
<EOS>
Nettleship
be
a
lady
rather
below
the
middle
size
,
but
notaltogeth
destitute
of
personal
attraction
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
very
full
andvery
comely
figure
,
very
white
and
very
rounded
little
arm
,
with
pinkdimple
elbow
;
and
though
she
have
no
neck
,
or
at
least
none
that
wasperceptible
,
from
the
wreath
of
fat
above
and
below
it
,
she
have
cheekslarge
and
round
enough
to
make
up
for
the
deficiency
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
be
assmall
as
those
of
a
chinese
lady
,
but
very
black
and
bright
--
<EOS>
brightenough
,
her
late
husband
use
to
say
,
'
to
light
a
candle
at
;
'
and
hernose
have
the
prettiest
turn
up
point
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
be
this
featurethat
,
in
especial
,
call
forth
the
descriptive
power
of
Mr.
Cripps
,
who
appear
in
a
state
of
ecstasy
whenever
he
contemplate
it
,
orthought
of
it
,
and
have
a
slightly
turn
up
nose
himself
,
contend
,
reasonably
enough
,
that
no
beauty
could
exist
without
such
a
formation
,
and
that
grecian
nose
,
and
above
all
,
roman
nose
,
be
detestable
,
andunendurable
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
difficult
to
bring
Mrs.
Nettleship
to
hisopinion
;
and
though
she
fluster
and
blush
at
his
compliment
andfine
speech
,
and
profess
to
think
them
too
extravagant
,
it

by
TRUSSELL.Randulph

have
only

exact

the

I
to

that

you

disappointment

Ihave
experienced

<EOS>
with
your
generous
nature

quick
impulse

I
shouldnot
have
be
surprised
at
your

into
slight
indiscretion

you
should
have
plunge
so
deeply
into

so
very
profligate

grieve
me

<EOS>
yourconduct

I
believe
be

attributable

bad

therefore

in

utterly
reckless
of

ithought

sufficiently
guard
you

I
now
see

never

introduce
you

My

be
in
your

I
persuade
myself
youwould
discern
the
good
that
lie
beneath
the
surface
of
that
excellentman
,
and
anticipate
much
from
your
introduction
to
him
.
<EOS>
not
the

,
therefore
,
of
my
affliction
be
the
knowledge
that
you

forfeit

let
me
hope
it

"In

I

Trussell

I
call

I
understand
he
be
likely

<EOS>
""i

""Oh
,
brother

<EOS>
why
such
a

exclaim
Mrs.

"because
I
would
have

say
Abel

<EOS>
"
ientirely
disapprove
of
the

<EOS>
""The

be
a

Trussell

,
inmy
opinion

never

be
dispense
with

unless
a
total
revolution
takesplace
in

manner

<EOS>
It
be

though
the

and

a
great
good
be
accomplishedby
the
recognition

""There
be
other

I
trust

""I

in
abhorrence

small
basin
of

but
shewas
mistaken
,
and

his
chamber
,
wherenone

<EOS>

this
operationwith
the
utmost
anxiety
;

too
much
coal
;
and
lastly
,
forbid
him
tolight

.
<EOS>
Jacob

however
,

to
disobey
his
order
,
and
havingapplie
a
match

bit
of

andwithout

shortly
afterwards

,
and
find
what

,
besought
him
to
let
the
fire

and
at
last
wrungfrom

a
most
reluctant
assent

<EOS>
but

<EOS>
More

and
Jacob
peep
up
it
to
ascertainthe
cause
,
perceive
that
it
be

a
wisp
of

<EOS>
heimmediately

the
obstacle
,
and
in
sodoing
,
dislodge
two
heavy

which
fall
into

with
arattle
noise

<EOS>
at
this
sound
,
the
miser
,
who
have

into
a
slumber
,
instantly
spring
up
,
anduttere
a
wild
cry
,
order
both
his
daughter
and
Jacob
out
of
theroom
.
<EOS>
They
know
him
too
well
to
disobey

and
as
soon
as
they
be
go
,
he
get
out
of
bed
again
,
pluck
the
bag
from
the
fire
,

sacking
,
and
,
lock
them
carefully
up
in
astrongbox
,
place
the
key
under
his
pillow
.
<EOS>
but
the
idea
of
the
discovery
of
his
hoard
haunt
him
,
and
,
combinedwith
the
fever
,
prevent
the
possibility
of
slumber
.
<EOS>
He
try
torecollect
the
different
place
where
he
have
hide
money
,
and
,
unable
tocall
them
all
to
mind
,
grow
almost
distract
.
<EOS>
Hilda
would
willinglyhave
sit
up
with
him
,
but
he
would
not
allow
her
;
neither
would
hepermit
Jacob
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
wait
till
he
think
all
be
asleep
,
andthen
rise
,
wrap
himself
in
his
dressing
-
gown
,
and
proceed
toexamine
several
nook
and
cranny
in
the
room
,
in
which
he
have
placedsmall
sum
of
money
.
<EOS>
all
his
hoard
be
safe
,
except
one
.
<EOS>
He
have
putten
guinea
in
a
glove
about
two
month
before
,
and
fancy
he
hadhidden
it
behind
a
shutter
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
there
,
and
,
convinced
thatJacob
have
discover
it
,
and
purloin
it
,
he
be
about
to
descend
andtax
him
with
the
robbery
,
when
he
all
at
once
recollect
that
he
hadplace
the
glove
under
a
broken
plank
near
the
hearthstone
.
<EOS>
heimmediately
take
up
the
board
,
and
there
,
sure
enough
,

the
losttreasure
.
<EOS>
make
easy
by
this
discovery
,
he
restore
the
glove
to
its
place
,
andreturne
to
bed
.
<EOS>
still
,
he
could
not
rest
.
<EOS>
an
idea
take
possession
ofhim
,
that
the
money
he
have
bury
in
the
cellar
be
go
,
and
unable
toshake
off
the
notion
,
he
arise
,
and
habit
himself
as
before
,
take
therushlight
that

by
his
bedside
,
and
,
with
tremble
but
cautiousstep
,

.
<EOS>
arrive
at
the
cellar
,
he
set
down
therushlight
,
and
cast
an
almost
piteous
look
at
the
cask
,
beneath
which
hehad

his
gold
,
as
if

to
know
whether
it

<EOS>
at
last
,
he
summon
up
resolution
for
the
task
,
and

to
thecoal

hole
,

himself
of
the
shovel
,
and
commence

<EOS>

him
with
strength
,
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
,
hehad
get
out
the
box
,
open
it
,
and
count
the
money
bag
,
which
hefound
all
right
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
count
the
gold
within
them
as
well
,
butneither
his
strength
nor
time
would
allow
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
while
thusemploye
,
he
form
a
terrible
exemplification
of
the
effect
thatavarice
may
produce
upon
the
mind
.
<EOS>
there
he
work
,
burn
with
feverin
a
damp
cellar
,
half
naked
,
for
he
have
take
off
his
dressing

toenable
him
to
ply
the
spade
with
great
freedom;--there
<EOS>

,
asif
life
and
death
be
in
his
effort
,
and
almost
look
,
<EOS>
such
be
hisghastly
appearance
,
like
a
corpse

its
own
grave
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
fearful
sight
to
see
,
and
it
be
witness
by
one
upon
whom
itmade
a
lasting
and
forcible
impression
.
<EOS>
this
be
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
Hearinghim
go
down
stair
,
she
have

him
,
and
see
what
he
be
about
,
butdid
not
dare
to
interrupt
him
,
apprehensive
of
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
when
he
have
get
out

box
,
and
examine
its
content
,
she
hope
allwas
over
,
and

proceed
to

room
,
rouse
him
,
and
tell

<EOS>
Jacob

,
and
have

former
occurrence
,
be
at
no
loss
tocomprehend

<EOS>
He
accordingly
,

atthe

and

the
hole
,
and
restore

place
to

formerappearance
.
<EOS>
It
be
wonderful
,
and
almost
incredible
,
to
see
how
thatfeeble
old
man
shake
by
sickness
,
and
totter
on
the
verge
of
thegrave
,
toil
--
how
he
persevere
<EOS>
--
how
he
take
the
earth
out
of

--
how
he
fill
up
the
hole
<EOS>
--
how
he
restore
the
brick
to

<EOS>
--
how
he
tread

foot
.
<EOS>
Jacob

amazed
<EOS>
,
andalmost

up
in

as
easily
as
if
he
have
be
a

andcarrie

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
He
swallow
a
basin
of
strong

,
prepare
for

for
he

and
in

of
a
few
hour

considerably
.
<EOS>
as

get
better
,

and
he
begin
to
recollect
something
of

the

shudder
as

but
he
would
not
acknowledge
the
justice
of

<EOS>
of
late
,
he
have
begin
to
entertain
a
dislike
to

wouldscarcely

to

<EOS>
have
see
him

when

to
prevent
anysuch

<EOS>
these
weapon
he
carry
with
him
to
his
bed

side
at
night
.
<EOS>
but
he
grow
daily
bad
and
bad
,
and
his
faculty
become
more
andmore
enfeeble
.
<EOS>
He
ramble
about
the
house
at
night
almost
in
a
state
ofsomnambulism
,
mutter
strange
thing
about
his

andfrequently
visit

at

constantly
follow
him
to
prevent
him
from
doinghimself
a
mischief
,
but
take
care
not
to
be
see
.
<EOS>
His
groan
andlamentation
be
pitiful
to
hear

for
he
have
begin
to
fancy
himself
aruine

not
even
the

assure
him

somewhat
calm
by

soon
clear
out
the
soil

the

He

at

by

that

all
he

indeed

very
much

<EOS>
He

no
lace
at
his
wrist

at
his

indeed
,
it
be
rather
questionable

from
the
manner
in
which
he
button
up
hiscoat
,
whether
he
have
a
shirt
at
