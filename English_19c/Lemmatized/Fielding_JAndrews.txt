BOOK
<EOS>
I.
  
.
  
<EOS>
of
write
life
in
general
,
and
particularly
of
Pamela
;
with
a
word
by
the
bye
of
Colley
Cibber
and
other
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
trite
but
true
observation
,
that
example
work
more
forcibly
on
the
mind
than
precept
:
and
if
this
be
just
in
what
be
odious
and
blameable
,
it
be
more
strongly
so
in
what
be
amiable
and
praiseworthy
.
<EOS>
here
emulation
most
effectually
operate
upon
us
,
and
inspire
our
imitation
in
an
irresistible
manner
.
<EOS>
a
good
man
therefore
be
a
stand
lesson
to
all
his
acquaintance
,
and
of
far
great
use
in
that
narrow
circle
than
a
good
book
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
it
often
happen
that
the
good
man
be
but
little
known
,
and
consequently
can
not
extend
the
usefulness
of
their
example
a
great
way
;
the
writer
may
be
call
in
aid
to
spread
their
history
farther
,
and
to
present
the
amiable
picture
to
those
who
have
not
the
happiness
of
know
the
original
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
by
communicate
such
valuable
pattern
to
the
world
,
he
may
perhaps
do
a
more
extensive
service
to
mankind
than
the
person
whose
life
originally
afford
the
pattern
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
light
I
have
always
regard
those
biographer
who
have
record
the
action
of
great
and
worthy
person
of
both
sex
.
<EOS>
not
to
mention
those
antient
writer
which
of
late
day
be
little
read
,
be
write
in
obsolete
,
and
as
they
be
generally
think
,
unintelligible
language
,
such
as
Plutarch
,
Nepos
,
and
other
which
I
hear
of
in
my
youth
;
our
own
language
afford
many
of
excellent
use
and
instruction
,
finely
calculate
to
sow
the
seed
of
virtue
in
youth
,
and
very
easy
to
be
comprehend
by
person
of
moderate
capacity
.
<EOS>
such
as
the
history
of
John
the
Great
,
who
,
by
his
brave
and
heroic
action
against
man
of
large
and
athletic
body
,
obtain
the
glorious
appellation
of
the
Giant
-
killer
;
that
of
an
Earl
of
Warwick
,
whose
christian
name
be
Guy
;
the
life
of
Argalus
and
Parthenia
;
and
above
all
,
the
history
of
those
seven
worthy
personage
,
the
Champions
of
Christendom
.
<EOS>
in
all
these
delight
be
mix
with
instruction
,
and
the
reader
be
almost
as
much
improve
as
entertain
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
pass
by
these
and
many
other
to
mention
two
book
lately
publish
,
which
represent
an
admirable
pattern
of
the
amiable
in
either
sex
.
<EOS>
the
former
of
these
,
which
deal
in
male
virtue
,
be
write
by
the
great
person
himself
,
who
live
the
life
he
hath
record
,
and
be
by
many
thought
to
have
live
such
a
life
only
in
order
to
write
it
.
<EOS>
the
other
be
communicate
to
us
by
an
historian
who
borrow
his
light
,
as
the
common
method
be
,
from
authentic
paper
and
record
.
<EOS>
the
reader
,
I
believe
,
already
conjecture
,
I
mean
the
life
of
Mr
Colley
Cibber
and
of
Mrs
Pamela
Andrews
.
<EOS>
how
artfully
doth
the
former
,
by
insinuate
that
he
escape
be
promote
to
the
high
station
in
Church
and
State
,
teach
us
a
contempt
of
worldly
grandeur
!
<EOS>
how
strongly
doth
he
inculcate
an
absolute
submission
to
our
superior
!
<EOS>
lastly
,
how
completely
doth
he
arm
us
against
so
uneasy
,
so
wretche
a
passion
as
the
fear
of
shame
!
<EOS>
how
clearly
doth
he
expose
the
emptiness
and
vanity
of
that
phantom
,
reputation
!
  
<EOS>
what
the
female
reader
be
teach
by
the
memoir
of
Mrs
Andrews
be
so
well
set
forth
in
the
excellent
essay
or
letter
prefix
to
the
second
and
subsequent
edition
of
that
work
,
that
it
would
be
here
a
needless
repetition
.
<EOS>
the
authentic
history
with
which
I
now
present
the
public
be
an
instance
of
the
great
good
that
book
be
likely
to
do
,
and
of
the
prevalence
of
example
which
I
have
just
observe
:
since
it
will
appear
that
it
be
by
keep
the
excellent
pattern
of
his
sister
's
virtue
before
his
eye
,
that
Mr
Joseph
Andrews
be
chiefly
enable
to
preserve
his
purity
in
the
midst
of
such
great
temptation
.
<EOS>
I
shall
only
add
that
this
character
of
male
chastity
,
though
doubtless
as
desirable
and
become
in
one
part
of
the
human
specie
as
in
the
other
,
be
almost
the
only
virtue
which
the
great
apologist
hath
not
give
himself
for
the
sake
of
give
the
example
to
his
reader
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
of
Mr
Joseph
Andrews
,
his
birth
,
parentage
,
education
,
and
great
endowment
;
with
a
word
or
two
concern
ancestor
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Joseph
Andrews
,
the
hero
of
our
ensue
history
,
be
esteem
to
be
the
only
son
of
Gaffar
and
Gammer
Andrews
,
and
brother
to
the
illustrious
Pamela
,
whose
virtue
be
at
present
so
famous
.
<EOS>
as
to
his
ancestor
,
we
have
search
with
great
diligence
,
but
little
success
;
be
unable
to
trace
them
farther
than
his
great
-
grandfather
,
who
,
as
an
elderly
person
in
the
parish
remember
to
have
hear
his
father
say
,
be
an
excellent
cudgel
-
player
.
<EOS>
whether
he
have
any
ancestor
before
this
,
we
must
leave
to
the
opinion
of
our
curious
reader
,
find
nothing
of
sufficient
certainty
to
rely
on
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
can
not
omit
insert
an
epitaph
which
an
ingenious
friend
of
ours
hath
communicate
:
        
<EOS>
Stay
,
traveller
,
for
underneath
this
pew
    
<EOS>
Lies
fast
asleep
that
merry
man
Andrew
:
    
<EOS>
when
the
last
day
's
great
sun
shall
gild
the
sky
,
    
then
he
shall
from
his
tomb
get
up
and
rise
.
    
<EOS>
be
merry
while
thou
canst
:
for
surely
thou
    
Shalt
shortly
be
as
sad
as
he
be
now
.
  
<EOS>
the
word
be
almost
out
of
the
stone
with
antiquity
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
needless
to
observe
that
Andrew
here
be
writ
without
an
s
,
and
be
,
besides
,
a
christian
name
.
<EOS>
My
friend
,
moreover
,
conjecture
this
to
have
be
the
founder
of
that
sect
of
laugh
philosopher
since
call
Merry
-
andrews
.
  
<EOS>
to
waive
,
therefore
,
a
circumstance
which
,
though
mention
in
conformity
to
the
exact
rule
of
biography
,
be
not
greatly
material
,
I
proceed
to
thing
of
more
consequence
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
sufficiently
certain
that
he
have
as
many
ancestor
as
the
good
man
live
,
and
,
perhaps
,
if
we
look
five
or
six
hundred
year
backwards
,
may
be
relate
to
some
person
of
very
great
figure
at
present
,
whose
ancestor
within
half
the
last
century
be
bury
in
as
great
obscurity
.
<EOS>
but
suppose
,
for
argument
's
sake
,
we
should
admit
that
he
have
no
ancestor
at
all
,
but
have
spring
up
,
accord
to
the
modern
phrase
,
out
of
a
dunghill
,
as
the
Athenians
pretend
they
themselves
do
from
the
earth
,
would
not
this
autokopros[a
]
have
be
justly
entitle
to
all
the
praise
arise
from
his
own
virtue
?
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
hard
that
a
man
who
hath
no
ancestor
should
therefore
be
render
incapable
of
acquire
honour
;
when
we
see
so
many
who
have
no
virtue
enjoy
the
honour
of
their
forefather
?
<EOS>
at
ten
year
old
(
by
which
time
his
education
be
advanced
to
write
and
read
)
<EOS>
he
be
bind
an
apprentice
,
accord
to
the
statute
,
to
Sir
Thomas
Booby
,
an
uncle
of
Mr
Booby
's
by
the
father
's
side
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
have
then
an
estate
in
his
own
hand
,
the
young
Andrews
be
at
first
employ
in
what
in
the
country
they
call
keep
bird
.
<EOS>
His
office
be
to
perform
the
part
the
ancient
assign
to
the
god
Priapus
,
which
deity
the
modern
call
by
the
name
of
Jack
o
'
lent
;
but
his
voice
be
so
extremely
musical
,
that
it
rather
allure
the
bird
than
terrify
them
,
he
be
soon
transplant
from
the
field
into
the
dog
-
kennel
,
where
he
be
place
under
the
huntsman
,
and
make
what
the
sportsman
term
whipper
-
in
.
<EOS>
for
this
place
likewise
the
sweetness
of
his
voice
disqualify
him
;
the
dog
prefer
the
melody
of
his
chiding
to
all
the
alluring
note
of
the
huntsman
,
who
soon
become
so
incensed
at
it
,
that
he
desire
Sir
Thomas
to
provide
otherwise
for
him
,
and
constantly
lay
every
fault
the
dog
be
at
to
the
account
of
the
poor
boy
,
who
be
now
transplant
to
the
stable
.
<EOS>
here
he
soon
give
proof
of
strength
and
agility
beyond
his
year
,
and
constantly
ride
the
most
spirited
and
vicious
horse
to
water
,
with
an
intrepidity
which
surprize
every
one
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
in
this
station
,
he
ride
several
race
for
Sir
Thomas
,
and
this
with
such
expertness
and
success
,
that
the
neighbouring
gentleman
frequently
solicit
the
knight
to
permit
little
Joey
(
for
so
he
be
call
)
to
ride
their
match
.
<EOS>
the
good
gamester
,
before
they
lay
their
money
,
always
inquire
which
horse
<EOS>
little
Joey
be
to
ride
;
and
the
bet
be
rather
proportion
by
the
rider
than
by
the
horse
himself
;
especially
after
he
have
scornfully
refuse
a
considerable
bribe
to
play
booty
on
such
an
occasion
.
<EOS>
this
extremely
raise
his
character
,
and
so
please
the
Lady
Booby
,
that
she
desire
to
have
him
(
be
now
seventeen
year
of
age
)
for
her
own
footboy
.
  
<EOS>

English

from

<EOS>
Joey
be
now
prefer
from
the
stable
to
attend
on
his
lady
,
to
go
on
her
errand
,
stand
behind
her
chair
,
wait
at
her
tea
-
table
,
and
carry
her
prayer
-
book
to
church
;
at
which
place
his
voice
give
him
an
opportunity
of
distinguish
himself
by
singe
psalm
:
he
behave
likewise
in
every
other
respect
so
well
at
Divine
service
,
that
it
recommend
him
to
the
notice
of
Mr
Abraham
Adams
,
the
curate
,
who
take
an
opportunity
one
day
,
as
he
be
drink
a
cup
of
ale
in
Sir
Thomas
's
kitchen
,
to
ask
the
young
man
several
question
concern
religion
;
with
his
answer
to
which
he
be
wonderfully
pleased
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
of
Mr
Abraham
Adams
<EOS>
the
curate
,
Mrs
Slipslop
<EOS>
the
chambermaid
,
and
other
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Abraham
Adams
be
an
excellent
scholar
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
perfect
master
of
the
greek
and
latin
language
;
to
which
he
add
a
great
share
of
knowledge
in
the
oriental
tongue
;
and
could
read
and
translate
french
,
italian
,
and
spanish
.
<EOS>
He
have
apply
many
year
to
the
most
severe
study
,
and
have
treasure
up
a
fund
of
learn
rarely
to
be
meet
with
in
a
university
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
besides
,
a
man
of
good
sense
,
good
part
,
and
good
nature
;
but
be
at
the
same
time
as
entirely
ignorant
of
the
way
of
this
world
as
an
infant
just
enter
into
it
could
possibly
be
.
<EOS>
as
he
have
never
any
intention
to
deceive
,
so
he
never
suspect
such
a
design
in
other
.
<EOS>
He
be
generous
,
friendly
,
and
brave
to
an
excess
;
but
simplicity
be
his
characteristick
:
he
do
,
no
more
than
Mr
Colley
Cibber
,
apprehend
any
such
passion
as
malice
and
envy
to
exist
in
mankind
;
which
be
indeed
less
remarkable
in
a
country
parson
than
in
a
gentleman
who
hath
pass
his
life
behind
the
scene
,
 
a
place
which
hath
be
seldom
think
the
school
of
innocence
,
and
where
a
very
little
observation
would
have
convince
the
great
apologist
that
those
passion
have
a
real
existence
in
the
human
mind
.
  
<EOS>
His
virtue
,
and
his
other
qualification
,
as
they
render
him
equal
to
his
office
,
so
they
make
him
an
agreeable
and
valuable
companion
,
and
have
so
much
endeared
and
well
recommend
him
to
a
bishop
,
that
at
the
age
of
fifty
he
be
provide
with
a
handsome
income
of
twenty
-
three
pound
a
year
;
which
,
however
,
he
could
not
make
any
great
figure
with
,
because
he
live
in
a
dear
country
,
and
be
a
little
encumber
with
a
wife
and
six
child
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
this
gentleman
,
who
have
,
as
I
have
say
,
<EOS>
observe
the
singular
devotion
of
young
Andrews
,
have
find
mean
to
question
him
concern
several
particular
;
as
,
how
many
book
there
be
in
the
New
Testament
?
<EOS>
which
be
they
?
<EOS>
how
many
chapter
they
contain
?
<EOS>
and
such
like
:
<EOS>
to
all
which
,
Mr
Adams
privately
say
,
he
answer
much
well
than
Sir
Thomas
,
or
two
other
neighbouring
justice
of
the
peace
could
probably
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Adams
be
wonderfully
solicitous
to
know
at
what
time
,
and
by
what
opportunity
,
the
youth
become
acquaint
with
these
matter
:
Joey
tell
him
that
he
have
very
early
learnt
to
read
and
write
by
the
goodness
of
his
father
,
who
,
though
he
have
not
interest
enough
to
get
him
into
a
charity
school
,
because
a
cousin
of
his
father
's
landlord
do
not
vote
on
the
right
side
for
a
churchwarden
in
a
borough
town
,
yet
have
be
himself
at
the
expense
of
sixpence
a
week
for
his
learning
.
<EOS>
He
tell
him
likewise
,
that
ever
since
he
be
in
Sir
Thomas
's
family
he
have
employ
all
his
hour
of
leisure
in
read
good
book
;
that
he
have
read
the
Bible
,
the
whole
Duty
of
Man
,
and
Thomas
a
Kempis
;
and
that
as
often
as
he
could
,
without
be
perceive
,
he
have
study
a
great
good
book
which
lie
open
in
the
hall
window
,
where
he
have
read
,
"
as
how
the
devil
carry
away
half
a
church
in
sermon
-
time
,
without
hurt
one
of
the
congregation
;
and
as
how
a
field
of
corn
run
away
down
a
hill
with
all
the
tree
upon
it
,
and
cover
another
man
's
meadow
.
"
<EOS>
this
sufficiently
assure
Mr
Adams
that
the
good
book
mean
could
be
no
other
than
Baker
's
Chronicle
.
  
<EOS>
the
curate
,
surprize
to
find
such
instance
of
industry
and
application
in
a
young
man
who
have
never
meet
with
the
least
encouragement
,
ask
him
,
if
he
do
not
extremely
regret
the
want
of
a
liberal
education
,
and
the
not
have
be
bear
of
parent
who
may
have
indulge
his
talent
and
desire
of
knowledge
?
<EOS>
to
which
he
answer
,
"
He
hope
he
have
profit
somewhat
well
from
the
book
he
have
read
than
to
lament
his
condition
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
that
,
for
his
part
,
he
be
perfectly
content
with
the
state

that
he
should
endeavour
to
improve
his
talent
,
which
be
all
require
of
him
;
but
not
repine
at
his
own
lot

nor
envy
those
of
his
better
.

"
well
say
,
my
lad
,

reply
the
curate
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
wish
some
who
have
read
many
more
good
book
,
nay
,
and
some
who
have
write
good
book
themselves

have
profit
so
much
by

"
  
<EOS>
Adams
have
no
near
access
to
Sir
Thomas
or
my
lady
than
through
the
waiting
-
gentlewoman
;
for
Sir
Thomas
be
too
apt
to
estimate
man
merely
by
their
dress
or
fortune
;
and
my
lady
be
a
woman
of
gaiety
,
who
have
be
bless
with
a
town
education
,
and
never
speak
of
any
of
her
country
neighbour
by
any
other
appellation
than
that
of
the
brute
.
<EOS>
They
both
regard
the
curate
as
a
kind
of
domestic
only
,
belong
to
the
parson
of
the
parish
,
who
be
at
this
time
at
variance
with
the
knight
;
for
the
parson
have
for
many
year
live
in
a
constant
state
of
civil
war
,
or
,
which
be
perhaps
as
bad
,
of
civil
law
,
with
Sir
Thomas
himself
and
the
tenant
of
his
manor
.
<EOS>
the
foundation
of
this
quarrel
be
a
modus
,
by
set
which
aside
an
advantage
of
several
shilling
per
annum
would
have
accrue
to
the
rector
;
but
he
have
not
yet
be
able
to
accomplish
his
purpose
,
and
have
reap
hitherto
nothing
well
from
the
suit
than
the
pleasure
(
which
he
use
indeed
frequently
to
say
be
no
small
one
)
of
reflect
that
he
have
utterly
undo
many
of
the
poor
tenant
,
though
he
have
at
the
same
time
greatly
impoverish
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Slipslop
,
the
waiting
-
gentlewoman
,
be
herself
the
daughter
of
a
curate
,
preserve
some
respect
for
Adams
:
she
profess
great
regard
for
his
learning
,
and
would
frequently
dispute
with
him
on
point
of
theology
;
but
always
insist
on
a
deference
to
be
pay
to
her
understanding
,
as
she
have
be
frequently
at
London
,
and
know
more
of
the
world
than
a
country
parson
could
pretend
to
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
in
these
dispute
a
particular
advantage
over
Adams
:
for
she
be
a
mighty
affecter
of
hard
word
,
which
she
use
in
such
a
manner
that
the
parson
,
who
durst
not
offend
her
by
call
her
word
in
question
,
be
frequently
at
some
loss
to
guess
her
meaning
,
and
would
have
be
much
less
puzzle
by
an
arabian
manuscript
.
  
<EOS>
Adams
therefore
take
an
opportunity
one
day
,
after
a
pretty
long
discourse
with
her
on
the
essence
(
or
,
as
she
please
to
term
it
,
the
incence
)
of
matter
,
to
mention
the
case
of
young
Andrews
;
desire
her
to
recommend
him
to
her
lady
as
a
youth
very
susceptible
of
learning
,
and
one
whose
instruction
in
Latin
he
would
himself
undertake
;
by
which
mean
he
may
be
qualified
for
a
high
station
than
that
of
a
footman
;
and
add
,
<EOS>
she
know
it
be
in
his
master
's
power
easily
to
provide
for
him
in
a
well
manner
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
desire
that
the
boy
may
be
leave
behind
under
his
care
.
  
<EOS>
"
La
!
<EOS>
Mr
Adams
,
"
say
Mrs
Slipslop
,
"
do
you
think
my
lady
will
suffer
any
preamble
about
any
such
matter
?
<EOS>
She
be
go
to
London
very
concisely
,
and
I
be
confidous
would
not
leave
Joey
behind
her
on
any
account
;
for
he
be
one
of
the
genteel
young
fellow
you
may
see
in
a
summer
's
day
;
and
I
be
confidous
she
would
as
soon
think
of
part
with
a
pair
of
her
grey
mare
,
for
she
value
herself
as
much
on
one
as
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
Adams
would
have
interrupt
,
but
she
proceed
:
"
<EOS>
and
why
be
Latin
more
necessitous
for
a
footman
than
a
gentleman
?
<EOS>
It
be
very
proper
that
you
clergyman
must
learn
it
,
because
you
can
not
preach
without
it
:
but
<EOS>
I
have
hear
gentleman
say
in
London
,
that
it
be
fit
for
nobody
else
.
<EOS>
I
be
confidous
my
lady
would
be
angry
with
me
for
mention
it
;
and
I
shall
draw
myself
into
no
such
delemy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
at
which
word
her
lady
's
bell
rung
,
and
Mr
Adams
be
force
to
retire
;
nor
could
he
gain
a
second
opportunity
with
her
before
their
London
journey
,
which
happen
a
few
day
afterwards
.
<EOS>
however
,
Andrews
behave
very
thankfully
and
gratefully
to
him
for
his
intend
kindness
,
which
he
tell
him
he
never
would
forget
,
and
at
the
same
time
receive
from
the
good
man
many
admonition
concern
the
regulation
of
his
future
conduct
,
and
his
perseverance
in
innocence
and
industry
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
what
happen
after
their
journey
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
no
sooner
be
young
Andrews
arrive
at
London
than
he
begin
to
scrape
an
acquaintance
with
his
party
-
colour
brother
,
who
endeavour
to
make
him
despise
his
former
course
of
life
.
<EOS>
His
hair
be
cut
after
the
new
fashion
,
and
become
his
chief
care
;
he
go
abroad
with
it
all
the
morning
in
paper
,
and
drest
it
out
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
,
however
,
teach
him
to
game
,
swear
,
drink
,
nor
any
other
genteel
vice
the
town
abound
with
.
<EOS>
He
apply
most
of
his
leisure
hour
to
music
,
in
which
he
greatly
improve
himself
;
and
become
so
perfect
a
connoisseur
in
that
art
,
that
he
lead
the
opinion
of
all
the
other
footman
at
an
opera
,
and
they
never
condemn
or
applaud
a
single
song
contrary
to
his
approbation
or
dislike
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
little
too
forward
in
riot
at
the
play
-
house
and
assembly
;
and
when
he
attend
his
lady
at
church
(
which
be
but
seldom
)
<EOS>
he
behave
with
less
seeming
devotion
than
formerly
:
however
,
if
he
be
outwardly
a
pretty
fellow
,
his
moral
remain
entirely
uncorrupted
,
though
he
be
at
the
same
time
smarter
and
genteeler
than
any
of
the
beaus
in
town
,
either
in
or
out
of
livery
.
  
<EOS>
His
lady
,
who
have
often
say
of
him
that
Joey
be
the
handsome
and
genteel
footman
in
the
kingdom
,
but
that
it
be
pity
he
want
spirit
,
begin
now
to
find
that
fault
no
longer
;
on
the
contrary
,
she
be
frequently
hear
to
cry
out
,
"
ay
,
there
be
some
life
in
this
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
plainly
see
the
effect
which
the
town
air
hath
on
the
soberest
constitution
.
<EOS>
She
would
now
walk
out
with
him
into
Hyde
Park
in
a
morning
,
and
when
tired
,
which
happen
almost
every
minute
,
would
lean
on
his
arm
,
and
converse
with
him
in
great
familiarity
.
<EOS>
whenever
she
stept
out
of
her
coach
,
she
would
take
him
by
the
hand
,
and
sometimes
,
for
fear
of
stumble
,
press
it
very
hard
;
she
admit
him
to
deliver
message
at
her
bedside
in
a
morning
,
leer
at
him
at
table
,
and
indulge
him
in
all
those
innocent
freedom
which
woman
of
figure
may
permit
without
the
least
sully
of
their
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
their
virtue
remain
unsullied
,
yet
now
and
then
some
small
arrow
will
glance
on
the
shadow
of
it
,
their
reputation
;
and
so
it
fall
out
to
Lady
Booby
,
who
happen
to
be
walk
arm
-
in
-
arm
with
Joey
one
morning
in
Hyde
Park
,
when
Lady
Tittle
and
Lady
Tattle
come
accidentally
by
in
their
coach
.
<EOS>
"
bless
me
,
"
say
Lady
Tittle
,
"
can
I
believe
my
eye
?
<EOS>
be
that
Lady
Booby
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
surely
,
"
say
Tattle
.
<EOS>
"
but
what
make
you
surprize
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
be
not
that
her
footman
?
"
reply
Tittle
.
<EOS>
at
which
Tattle
laugh
,
and
cry
,
"
an
old
business
,
I
assure
you
:
be
it
possible
<EOS>
you
should
not
have
hear
it
?
<EOS>
the
whole
town
hath
know
it
this
half
-
year
.
<EOS>
"
the
consequence
of
this
interview
be
a
whisper
through
a
hundred
visit
,
which
be
separately
perform
by
the
two
ladies[A
]
the
same
afternoon
,
and
may
have
have
a
mischievous
effect
,
have
it
not
be
stopt
by
two
fresh
reputation
which
be
publish
the
day
afterwards
,
and
engross
the
whole
talk
of
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
[
a

<EOS>
It
may
seem
an
absurdity
that
Tattle
should
visit
,
as
she
actually
    
do
,
to
spread
a
know
scandal
:
but
the
reader
may
reconcile
this
by
    
supposing
,
with
me
,
that
,
notwithstanding
what
she
say
,
this
be
    
her
first
acquaintance
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
whatever
opinion
or
suspicion
the
scandalous
inclination
of
defamer
may
entertain
of
Lady
Booby
's
innocent
freedom
,
it
be
certain
they
make
no
impression
on
young
Andrews
,
who
never
offer
to
encroach
beyond
the
liberty
which
his
lady
allow
him
,
 
a
behaviour
which
she
impute
to
the
violent
respect
he
preserve
for
her
,
and
which
serve
only
to
heighten
a
something
she
begin
to
conceive
,
and
which
the
next
chapter
will
open
a
little
farther
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
the
death
of
Sir
Thomas
Booby
,
with
the
affectionate
and
mournful
behaviour
of
his
widow
,
and
the
great
purity
of
Joseph
Andrews
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
time
an
accident
happen
which
put
a
stop
to
those
agreeable
walk
,
which
probably
would
have
soon
puff
up
the
cheek
of
Fame
,
and
cause
her
to
blow
her
brazen
trumpet
through
the
town
;
and
this
be
no
other
than
the
death
of
Sir
Thomas
Booby
,
who
,
depart
this
life
,
leave
his
disconsolate
lady
confine
to
her
house
,
as
closely
as
if
she
herself
have
be
attack
by
some
violent
disease
.
<EOS>
during
the
first
six
day
the
poor
lady
admit
none
but
Mrs.
Slipslop
,
and
three
female
friend
,
who
make
a
party
at
card
:
but
on
the
seventh
she
order
Joey
,
whom
,
for
a
good
reason
,
we
shall
hereafter
call
JOSEPH
,
to
bring
up
her
tea
-
kettle
.
<EOS>
the
lady
be
in
bed
,
call
Joseph
to
her
,
bade
him
sit
down
,
and
,
have
accidentally
lay
her
hand
on
his
,
she
ask
him
if
he
have
ever
be
in
love
.
<EOS>
Joseph
answer
,
with
some
confusion
,
it
be
time
enough
for
one
so
young
as
himself
to
think
on
such
thing
.
"
<EOS>
as
young
as
you
be
,
"
reply
the
lady
,
"
I
be
convinced
you
be
no
stranger
to
that
passion
.
<EOS>
come
,
Joey
,
"
say
she
,
"
tell
me
truly
,
who
be
the
happy
girl
whose
eye
have
make
a
conquest
of
you
?
"
<EOS>
Joseph
return
,
that
all
the
woman
he
have
ever
see
be
equally
indifferent
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
oh
then
,
"
say
the
lady
,
"
you
be
a
general
lover
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
you
handsome
fellow
,
like
handsome
woman
,
be
very
long
and
difficult
in
fix
;
but
yet
you
shall
never
persuade
me
that
your
heart
be
so
insusceptible
of
affection
<EOS>
;
I
rather
impute
what
you
say
to
your
secrecy
,
a
very
commendable
quality
,
and
what
I
be
far
from
be
angry
with
you
for
.
<EOS>
nothing
can
be
more
unworthy
in
a
young
man
,
than
to
betray
any
intimacy
with
the
lady
.
"
<EOS>
"
lady
!
<EOS>
madam
<EOS>
,
"
say
Joseph
,
"
I
be
sure
I
never
have
the
impudence
to
think
of
any
that
deserve
that
name
.
"
<EOS>
"
do
not
pretend
to
too
much
modesty
,
"
say
she
,
"
for
that
sometimes
may
be
impertinent
:
but
pray
answer
me
this
question
.
<EOS>
suppose
a
lady
should
happen
to
like
you
;
suppose
she
should
prefer
you
to
all
your
sex
,
and
admit
you
to
the
same
familiarity
as
you
may
have
hope
for
if
you
have
be
bear
her
equal
,
be
you
certain
that
no
vanity
could
tempt
you
to
discover
her
?
<EOS>
answer
me
honestly
,
Joseph
;
have
you
so
much
more
sense
<EOS>
and
so
much
more
virtue
than
you
handsome
young
fellow
generally
have
,
who
make
no
scruple
of
sacrifice
our
dear
reputation
to
your
pride
,
without
consider
the
great
obligation
we
lay
on
you
by
our
condescension
and
confidence
?
<EOS>
Can
you
keep
a
secret
,
my
Joey
?
"
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
hope
your
ladyship
can
not
tax
me
with
ever
betray
the
secret
of
the
family
;
and
I
hope
,
if
you
be
to
turn
me
away
,
I
may
have
that
character
of
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
intend
to
turn
you
away
,
Joey
,
"
say
she
,
and
sigh
;
"
I
be
afraid
it
be
not
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
then
raise
herself
a
little
in
her
bed
,
and
discover
one
of
the
white
neck
that
ever
be
see
;
at
which
Joseph
blush
.
<EOS>
"
La
!
"
say
she
,
in
an
affected
surprize
,
"
what
be
I
do
?
<EOS>
I
have
trust
myself
with
a
man
alone
,
naked
in
bed
;
suppose
you
should
have
any
wicked
intention
upon
my
honour
,
how
should
I
defend
myself
?
"
<EOS>
Joseph
protest
that
he
never
have
the
least
evil
design
against
her
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
"
say
she
,
"
perhaps
you
may
not
call
your
design
wicked
;
and
perhaps
they
be
not
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
swear
they
be
not
.
<EOS>
"
You
misunderstand
me
,
"
say
she
;
"
I
mean
if
they
be
against
my
honour
,
they
may
not
be
wicked
;
but
the
world
call
them
so
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
say
you
,
the
world
will
never
know
anything
of
the
matter
;
yet
would
not
that
be
trust
to
your
secrecy
?
<EOS>
Must
not
my
reputation
be
then
in
your
power
?
<EOS>
Would
you
not
then
be
my
master
?
"
<EOS>
Joseph
beg
her
ladyship
to
be
comfort
;
for
that
he
would
never
imagine
the
least
wicked
thing
against
her
,
and
that
he
have
rather
die
a
thousand
death
than
give
her
any
reason
to
suspect
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
must
have
reason
to
suspect
you
.
<EOS>
be
you
not
a
man
?
<EOS>
and
,
without
vanity
,
I
may
pretend
to
some
charm
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
you
may
fear
I
should
prosecute
you
;

we
have
have
a
misfortune

My

what

my

be
certainly
go
distract
.
<EOS>
none
of
the
servant
expect
her
to
take
it
so
to
heart
,
because
they
quarrel
almost
every
day
of
their
life
:
but
no
more
of
that
,
because
you
know
,
Pamela
,
I
never
love
to
tell
the
secret
of
my
master
's
family
;
but
to
be
sure
you
must
have
know
they
never
love
one
another
;
and
I
have
hear
her
ladyship
wish
his
honour
dead
above
a
thousand
time
;
but
nobody
know
what
it
be
to
lose
a
friend
till
they
have
lose
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
tell
anybody
what
I
write

because
I
should
not
care
to
have
folk

I
discover
what

if
it

not

I

do
not

but
she
order
me
to
sit
down
by
her
bedside

when
she
be
in
naked
bed
;
and
she
hold
my
hand
,
and
talk
exactly
as

to
her

which
I

if

a

then
I

I

<EOS>
as
soon
as
Joseph
have
seal
and
direct
this
letter
he
walk
downstairs
,
where
he
meet
Mrs.
Slipslop
,
with
whom
we
shall
take
this
opportunity
to
bring
the
reader
a
little
better
acquaint
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
maiden
gentlewoman
of
about
forty
-
five
year
of
age
,
who
,
have
make
a
small
slip
in
her
youth
,
have
continue
a
good
maid
ever
since
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
at
this
time
remarkably
handsome
;
be
very
short
,
and
rather
too
corpulent
in
body
,
and
somewhat
red
,
with
the
addition
of
pimple
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
Her
nose
be
likewise
rather
too
large
,
and
her
eye
too
little
;
nor
do
she
resemble
a
cow
so
much
in
her
breath
as
in
two
brown
globe
which
she
carry
before
her
;
one
of
her
leg
be
also
a
little
short
than
the
other
,
which
occasion
her
to
limp
as
she
walk
.
<EOS>
this
fair
creature
have
long
cast
the
eye
of
affection
on
Joseph
,
in
which
she
have
not
meet
with
quite
so
good
success
as
she
probably
wish
,
though
,
besides
the
allurement
of
her
native
charm
,
she
have
give
him
tea
,
sweetmeat
,
wine
,
and
many
other
delicacy
,
of
which
,
by
keep
the
key
,
she
have
the
absolute
command
.
<EOS>
Joseph
,
however
,
have
not
return
the
least
gratitude
to
all
these
favour
,
not
even
so
much
as
a
kiss
;
though
I
would
not
insinuate
she
be
so
easily
to
be
satisfied
;
for
surely
then
he
would
have
be
highly
blameable
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
she
be
arrive
at
an
age
when
she
think
she
may
indulge
herself
in
any
liberty
with
a
man
,
without
the
danger
of
bring
a
third
person
into
the
world
to
betray
them
.
<EOS>
She
imagine
that
by
so
long
a
self
-
denial
she
have
not
only
make
amend
for
the
small
slip
of
her
youth
above
hint
at
,
but
have
likewise
lay
up
a
quantity
of
merit
to
excuse
any
future
failing
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
she
resolve
to
give
a
loose
to
her
amorous
inclination
,
and
to
pay
off
the
debt
of
pleasure
which
she
find
she
owe
herself
,
as
fast
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
with
these
charm
of
person
,
and
in
this
disposition
of
mind
,
she
encounter
poor
Joseph
at
the
bottom
of
the
stair
,
and
ask
him
if
he
would
drink
a
glass
of
something
good
this
morning
.
<EOS>
Joseph
,
whose
spirit
be
not
a
little
cast
down
,
very
readily
and
thankfully
accept
the
offer
;
and
together
they
go
into
a
closet
,
where
,
have
deliver
him
a
full
glass
of
ratafia
,
and
desire
him
to
sit
down
,
Mrs.
Slipslop
thus
begin
:
    
"
sure
nothing
can
be
a
more
simple
contract
in
a
woman
than
to
place
her
affection
on
a
boy
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
ever
think
it
would
have
be
my
fate
,
I
should
have
wish
to
die
a
thousand
death
rather
than
live
to
see
that
day
.
<EOS>
if
we
like
a
man
,
the
light
hint
sophisticate
.
<EOS>
whereas
a
boy
propose
upon
us
to
break
through
all
the
regulation
of
modesty
,
before
we
can
make
any
oppression
upon
him

"

Mrs.

some
warmth

treat

I
do
not
understand
your
hard
word

I
be
certain
you
have
no
occasion

call
me
ungrateful

for

so
far
from
intend
you
any
wrong

I
have
always

Mrs.
Slipslop

rage

your

do
you
assinuate
that
I
be
old
enough
to
be
your
mother
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
a
stripling
may
think
,
but
I
believe
a
man
would
refer
me
to
any
green
-
sickness
silly
girl
whatsomdever
:
<EOS>
but
I
ought
to
despise
you
rather
than
be
angry
with
you

for
refer
the
conversation
of
girl
to
that
of
a
woman
of
sense

"
 
<EOS>
"
Madam

"
say
Joseph

"
I
be
sure
I
have
always
value

I

of
learning

"
<EOS>
yes

Joseph

say
she
,
a
little
soften
by
the
compliment
to
her
learning
,
"
if
you
have
a
value
for
me

you
certainly
would
have
find
some
method
of
show
it

for
I
be
convict
<EOS>
you
must
see
the
value
I
have
for
you

<EOS>
yes
,
Joseph
,
my
eye
,
whether
I
would
or
no
,
must
have
declare
a
passion
I
can
not
conquer
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
Joseph
!
"
  
<EOS>
as
when
a
hungry
tigress
,
who
long
have
traverse
the
wood
in
fruitless
search
,
see
within
the
reach
of
her
claws
a
lamb
,
she
prepare
to
leap
on
her
prey
;
or
as
a
voracious
pike
,
of
immense
size
,
survey
through
the
liquid
element
a
roach
or
gudgeon
,
which
can
not
escape
her
jaw
,
open
them
wide
to
swallow
the
little
fish
;
so
do
Mrs.
Slipslop
prepare
to
lay
her
violent
amorous
hand
on
the
poor
Joseph
,
when
luckily
her
mistress
's
bell
rung
,
and
deliver
the
intended
martyr
from
her
clutch

<EOS>
She
be
oblige
to
leave
him
abruptly
,
and
to
defer
the
execution
of
her
purpose
till
some
other
time
.
<EOS>
We
shall
therefore
return
to
the
Lady
Booby
,
and
give
our
reader
some
account
of
her
behaviour
,
after
she
be
leave
by
Joseph
in
a
temper
of
mind
not
greatly
different
from
that
of
the
inflame
Slipslop
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
saying
of
wise
man
.
<EOS>
a
dialogue
between
the
lady
and
her
maid
;
and
a
panegyric
,
or
rather
satire
,
on
the
passion
of
love
,
in
the
sublime
style
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
observation
of
some
antient
sage
,
whose
name
I
have
forget
,
that
passion
operate
differently
on
the
human
mind
,
as
disease
on
the
body
,
in
proportion
to
the
strength
or
weakness
,
soundness
or
rottenness
,
of
the
one
and
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
We
hope
,
therefore
,
a
judicious
reader
will
give
himself
some
pain
to
observe
,
what
we
have
so
greatly
laboured
to
describe
,
<EOS>
the
different
operation
of
this
passion
of
love
in
the
gentle
and
cultivated
mind
of
the
Lady
Booby
,
from
those
which
it
effect
in
the
less
polished
and
coarse
disposition
of
Mrs
Slipslop
.
  
<EOS>
another
philosopher
,
whose
name
also
at
present
escape
my
memory
<EOS>
,
hath
somewhere
say
,
that
resolution
take
in
the
absence
of
the
beloved
object
be
very
apt
to
vanish
in
its
presence
;
on
both
which
wise
saying
the
follow
chapter
may
serve
as
a
comment
.
  
<EOS>
no
sooner
have
Joseph
leave
the
room
in
the
manner
we
have
before
relate
than
the
lady
,
enrage
at
her
disappointment
,
begin
to
reflect
with
severity
on
her
conduct
.
<EOS>
Her
love
be
now
change
to
disdain
,
which
pride
assist
to
torment
her
.
<EOS>
She
despise
herself
for
the
meanness
of
her
passion
,
and
Joseph
for
its
ill
success
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
have
now
get
the
well
of
it
in
her
own
opinion
,
and
determine
immediately
to
dismiss
the
object
.
<EOS>
after
much
toss
and
turn
in
her
bed
,
and
many
soliloquy
,
which
if
we
have
no
well
matter
for
our
reader
we
would
give
him
,
she
at
last
rung
the
bell
as
above
mention
,
and
be
presently
attend
by
Mrs
Slipslop
,
who
be
not
much
better
pleased
with
Joseph
than
the
lady
herself

Booby

when
do
you

the
poor
woman
be
so
surprized
at
the
unexpected
sound
of
his
name
at
so
critical
a
time
,
that
she
have
the
great
difficulty
to
conceal
the
confusion
she
be
under
from
her
mistress
;
whom
she
answer
,
nevertheless
,
with
pretty
good
confidence
,
though
not
entirely
void
of
fear
of
suspicion
,
that
she
have
not
see
him
that
morning

I
be

a
wicked
one
too

my
knowledge
he
game

drink

swear

besides

he
be
horribly

answer
the

him
much
longer

yet
I
can
not
conceive
what
the
wench
see
in
him

to
be
so
foolishly
fond

Madam

"
ay

say
the

then
pray
pay
her
her
wage
instantly

<EOS>
I
will
keep
no
such
slut
in
my
family

<EOS>
and
as
for
Joseph
,
you
may
discard
him
too
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Would
your
ladyship
have
him
pay
off
immediately
?
"
cry
Slipslop
,
"
for
perhaps
,
when
Betty
be
go
he
may
mend
:
<EOS>
and
really
the
boy
be
a
good
servant
,
and
a
strong
healthy
luscious
boy
enough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
morning
,
"
answer
the
lady
with
some
vehemence
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
madam
,
"
cry
Slipslop
,
"
your
ladyship
would
be
so
good
as
to
try
him
a
little
longer
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
have
my
command
dispute
,
"
say
the
lady
;
"
sure
you
be
not
fond
of
him
yourself
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
,
madam
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Slipslop
,
reddening
,
if
not
blush
,
"
I
should
be
sorry
to
think
your
ladyship
have
any
reason
to
respect
me
of
fondness
for
a
fellow
;
and
if
it
be
your
pleasure
,
I
shall
fulfil
it
with
as
much
reluctance
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
as
little
,
I
suppose
you
mean
,
"
say
the
lady
;
"
and
so
about
it
instantly
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Slipslop
go
out
,
and
the
lady
have
scarce
take
two
turn
before
she
fall
to
knock
and
ring
with
great
violence
.
<EOS>
slipslop
,
who
do
not
travel
post
haste
,
soon
return
,
and
be
countermand
as
to
Joseph
,
but
order
to
send
Betty
about
her
business
without
delay
.
<EOS>
She
go
out
a
second
time
with
much
great
alacrity
than
before
;
when
the
lady
begin
immediately
to
accuse
herself
of
want
of
resolution
,
and
to
apprehend
the
return
of
her
affection
,
with
its
pernicious
consequence
;
she
therefore
apply
herself
again
to
the
bell
,
and
re
-
summon
Mrs.
Slipslop
into
her
presence
;
who
again
return
,
and
be
tell
by
her
mistress
that
she
have
consider
well
of
the
matter
,
and
be
absolutely
resolve
to
turn
away
Joseph
;
which
she
order
her
to
do
immediately
.
<EOS>
slipslop
,
who
know
the
violence
of
her
lady
's
temper
,
and
would
not
venture
her
place
for
any
Adonis
or
Hercules
in
the
universe
,
leave
her
a
third
time
;
which
she
have
no
sooner
do
,
than
the
little
god
Cupid
,
fear
he
have
not
yet
do
the
lady
's
business
,
take
a
fresh
arrow
with
the
sharp
point
out
of
his
quiver
,
and
shoot
it
directly
into
her
heart
;
in
other
and
plainer
language
,
the
lady
's
passion
get
the
well
of
her
reason
.
<EOS>
She
call
back
Slipslop
once
more
,
and
tell
her
she
have
resolve
to
see
the
boy
,
and
examine
him
herself
;
therefore
bid
her
send
him
up
.
<EOS>
this
wavering
in
her
mistress
's
temper
probably
put
something
into
the
waiting
-
gentlewoman
's
head
not
necessary
to
mention
to
the
sagacious
reader
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Booby
be
go
to
call
her
back
again
,
but
could
not
prevail
with
herself
.
<EOS>
the
next
consideration
therefore
be
,
how
she
should
behave
to
Joseph
when
he
come
in
.
<EOS>
She
resolve
to
preserve
all
the
dignity
of
the
woman
of
fashion
to
her
servant
,
and
to
indulge
herself
in
this
last
view
of
Joseph
(
for
that
she
be
most
certainly
resolve
it
should
be
)
at
his
own
expense
,
by
first
insult
and
then
discard
him
.
  
<EOS>
o
Love
,
what
monstrous
trick
dost
thou
play
with
thy
votary
of
both
sex
!
<EOS>
how
dost
thou
deceive
them
,
and
make
them
deceive
themselves
!
<EOS>
Their
folly
be
thy
delight
!
<EOS>
Their
sigh
make
thee
laugh
,
and
their
pang
be
thy
merriment
!
  
<EOS>
not
the
great
Rich
,
who
turn
man
into
monkey
,
wheel
-
barrow
,
and
whatever
else
good
humour
<EOS>
his
fancy
,
hath
so
strangely
metamorphose
the
human
shape
;
nor
the
great
Cibber
,
who
confound
all
number
,
gender
,
and
break
through
every
rule
of
grammar
at
his
will
,
hath
so
distort
the
english
language
as
thou
dost
metamorphose
and
distort
the
human
sense
.
  
<EOS>
Thou
puttest
out
our
eye
<EOS>
,
stoppest
up
our
ear
,
and
tak
away
the
power
of
our
nostril
;
so
that
we
can
neither
see
the
large
object
,
hear
the
loud
noise
,
nor
smell
the
most
poignant
perfume
.
<EOS>
again
,
when
thou
pleasest
,
thou
canst
make
a
molehill
appear
as
a
mountain
,
a
Jew's
-
harp
sound
like
a
trumpet
,
and
a
daisy
smell
like
a
violet
.
<EOS>
Thou
canst
make
cowardice
brave
,
avarice
generous
,
pride
humble
,
and
cruelty
tender

hearted

<EOS>
in
short
,
thou
turnest
the
heart
of
man
inside
out
,
as
a
juggler
doth
a
petticoat
,
and
bring
whatsoever
pleaseth
thee
out
from
it
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
any
one
who
doubt
all
this
,
let
him
read
the
next
chapter
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
in
which
,
after
some
very
fine
writing
,
the
history
go
on
,
and
relate
the
interview
between
the
lady
and
Joseph
;
where
the
latter
hath
set
an
example
which
we
despair
of
see
follow
by
his
sex
in
this
vicious
age
.
  
<EOS>
now
the
rake
Hesperus
have
call
for
his
breech
,
and
,
have
well
rub
his
drowsy
eye
,
prepare
to
dress
himself
for
all
night
;
by
whose
example
his
brother
rake
on
earth
likewise
leave
those
bed
in
which
they
have
sleep
away
the
day
.
<EOS>
now
Thetis
,
the
good
housewife
,
begin
to
put
on
the
pot
,
in
order
to
regale
the
good
man
Phoebus
after
his
daily
labour
be
over
.
<EOS>
in
vulgar
language
,
it
be
in
the
evening
when
Joseph
attend
his
lady
's
order
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
it
become
us
to
preserve
the
character
of
this
lady
,
who
be
the
heroine
of
our
tale
;
and
as
we
have
naturally
a
wonderful
tenderness
for
that
beautiful
part
of
the
human
specie
call
the
fair
sex
;
before
we
discover
too
much
of
her
frailty
to
our
reader
,
it
will
be
proper
to
give
him
a
lively
idea
of
the
vast
temptation
,
which
overcome
all
the
effort
of
a
modest
and
virtuous
mind
;
and
then
we
humbly
hope
his
good
nature
will
rather
pity
than
condemn
the
imperfection
of
human
virtue
.

Nay

the

be
induce

by
consider
the
uncommon
variety
of
charm
which
unite
in
this
young
man
's
person
,
to
bridle
their
rampant
passion
for
chastity
,
and
be
at
least
as
mild
as
their
violent
modesty
and
virtue
will
permit
them
,
in
censure
the
conduct
of
a
woman
who
,
perhaps
,
be
in
her
own
disposition
as
chaste
as
those
pure
and
sanctified
virgin
who
,
after
a
life
innocently
spend
in
the
gaiety
of
the
town
,
begin
about
fifty
to
attend
twice
per

at
the
polite

to
return
thank
for
the
grace
which
preserve
them
formerly
amongst

temptation
perhaps
less
powerful
than
what
now

the
Lady
Booby

<EOS>
Mr
Joseph
Andrews
be
now
in
the
one
-
and

twentieth
year
of
his
age

<EOS>
He
be
of
the
high
degree
of
middle
stature
;
his
limb
be
put
together
with
great
elegance
,
and
no
less
strength
;
his
leg
and
thigh
be
form
in
the
exact
proportion
;
his
shoulder
be
broad
and
brawny
,
but
yet
his
arm
hang
so
easily
,
that
he
have
all
the
symptom
of
strength
without
the
least
clumsiness
.
<EOS>
His
hair
be
of
a
nut
-
brown
colour
,
and
be
display
in
wanton
ringlet
down
his
back
;
his
forehead
be
high
,
his
eye
dark

and
as
full
of
sweetness
as
of
fire
;
his
nose
a
little
inclined
to
the
Roman

his
tooth
white
and
even

his
lip
full
,
red

and
soft

his
beard
be
only
rough

his
chin
and
upper
lip

but
his
cheek

in
which

blood
glow
,
be
overspread
with
a
thick
down
;
his
countenance
have
a
tenderness
join
with
a
sensibility
inexpressible
.
<EOS>
add
to
this
the
most
perfect
neatness
in
his
dress
,
and
an
air
which
,
to
those
who
have
not
see
many
nobleman
,
would
give
an
idea
of
nobility
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
person
who
now
appear
before
the
lady
.
<EOS>
She
view
him
some
time
in
silence
,
and
twice
or
thrice
before
she
spake
change
her
mind
as
to
the
manner
in
which
she
should
begin
.
<EOS>
at
length
she
say
to
him
,
"
Joseph
,
I
be
sorry
to
hear
such
complaint
against
you
:
I
be
tell
you
behave
so
rudely
to
the
maid
,
that
they
can
not
do
their
business
in
quiet
;
I
mean
those
who
be
not
wicked
enough
to
hearken
to
your
solicitation
.
<EOS>
as
to
other
,
they
may
,
perhaps
,
not
call
you
rude
;
for
there
be
wicked
slut
who
make
one
ashamed
of
one
's
own
sex
,
and
be
as
ready
to
admit
any
nauseous
familiarity
as
fellow
to
offer
it
:
<EOS>
nay
,
there
be
such
in
my
family
,
but
they
shall
not
stay
in
it
;
that
impudent
trollop
who
be
with
child
by
you
be
discharge
by
this
time
.

<EOS>
as
a
person
who
be
strike
through
the
heart
with
a
thunderbolt
look
extremely
surprised
,
nay
,
and
perhaps
be
so
too
 
<EOS>
thus
the
poor
Joseph
receive
the
false
accusation
of
his
mistress
;
he
blush
and
look
confounded
,
which
she
misinterpret
to
be
symptom
of
his
guilt
,
and
thus
go
on
:
    
"
<EOS>
come
hither
,
Joseph
<EOS>
:
another
mistress
may
discard
you
for
these
offence
;
but
I
have
a
compassion
for
your
youth

and
if
I
could
be
certain
you
would
be
<EOS>
no
more
guilty

hand
carelessly
upon

may
do
better
;
you
may
make
your
fortune

"
Madam

Joseph

"
I
do
assure
your

Joseph

answer
the

do
not

I
could
pardon

by
all
that

I
have
never

<EOS>
"
kissing
!
"
say
the
lady
,
with
great
discomposure
of
countenance
,
and
more
redness
in
her
cheek
than
anger
in
her
eye
;
"
do
you
call
that
no
crime

<EOS>
kissing
,
Joseph
,
be
as
a
prologue
to
a
play

<EOS>
Can
I
believe
a
young
fellow
of
your
age
and

will
be
content
with
kissing
?
<EOS>
no

Joseph

there
be
no

who
grant
that
but
will
grant
more

I
be
deceive
greatly
in

not
put
her
closely

<EOS>
what
would
you
think

Joseph

if
I
admit
you
to
kiss
me

<EOS>
Joseph
reply
he
would
sooner
die
than
have
any
such
thought

<EOS>
and
yet
,
Joseph

return
she

lady
have
admit

I
confess

tell

that

be
to
answer

would
not

insist
on
more

<EOS>
Would
you
be
content
with
a

<EOS>
Would
not
your

such

only
speak
out
of
tenderness
for
his
virtue

at
which
word
she

into
a
violent

more

instantly
to
leave

<EOS>
the

who
begin

admire
the
new
style
in
which
her
waiting

gentlewoman
deliver
herself
,
and
by
the
conclusion
of
her
speech
suspect
somewhat
of
the
truth

call
her
back
,
and
desire
to
know
what
she
mean
by
the
extraordinary
degree
of
freedom
in
which
she
think
proper

indulge
her
tongue

"
freedom

Slipslop

I

"
yes

I
assure

"
Impertinence

I
do
not

Slipslop

<EOS>
"
yes

indeed
you

my

manner

"
<EOS>
cry

I
never

neither

there

<EOS>
"
what
do
you

the

<EOS>
"
I
be
not

Slipslop

"
any
more
than
I

keep
it
a
secret

"
<EOS>
"
I
desire
you
would
provide
yourself
,
"
answer
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
with
all
my
heart
,
"
reply
the
waiting
-
gentlewoman
;
and
so
depart
in
a
passion
,
and
slap
the
door
after
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
too
plainly
perceive
that
her
waiting
-
gentlewoman
know
more
than
she
would
willingly
have
have
her
acquaint
with
;
and
this
she
impute
to
Joseph
's
have
discover
to
her
what
pass
at
the
first
interview
.
<EOS>
this
,
therefore
,
blow
up
her
rage
against
him
,
and
confirm
her
in
a
resolution
of
part
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
dismissing
Mrs
Slipslop
be
a
point
not
so
easily
to
be
resolve
upon
.
<EOS>
She
have
the
utmost
tenderness
for
her
reputation
,
as
she
know
on
that
depend
many
of
the
most
valuable
blessing
of
life
;
particularly
card
,
make
curtsy
in
public
place
,
and
,
above
all
,
the
pleasure
of
demolish
the
reputation
of
other
,
in
which
innocent
amusement
<EOS>
she
have
an
extraordinary
delight
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
determine
to
submit
to
any
insult
from
a
servant
,
rather
than
run
a
risque
of
lose
the
title
to
so
many
great
privilege
.
  
<EOS>
She
therefore
send
for
her
steward
,
Mr
Peter
Pounce
,
and
order
him
to
pay
Joseph
his
wage
,
to
strip
off
his
livery
,
and
to
turn
him
out
of
the
house
that
evening
.
  
<EOS>
She
then
call
Slipslop
up
,
and
,
after
refresh
her
spirit
with
a
small
cordial
,
which
she
keep
in
her
corset
,
she
begin
in
the
follow
manner
:
    
"
Slipslop
,
why
will
you
,
who
know
my
passionate
temper
,
attempt
to
provoke
me
by
your
answer
?
<EOS>
I
be
convinced
you
be
an
honest
servant
,
and
should
be
very
unwilling
to
part
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
believe
,
likewise
,
you
have
find
me
an
indulgent
mistress
on
many
occasion
,
and
have
as
little
reason
on
your
side
to
desire
a
change
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
be
surprize
,
therefore
,
that
you
will
take
the
sure
method
to
offend
me
 
I
mean
,
repeat
my
word
,
which
you
know
I
have
always
detest
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
prudent
waiting
-
gentlewoman
have
duly
weigh
the
whole
matter
,
and
find
,
on
mature
deliberation
,
that
a
good
place
in
possession
be
well
than
one
in
expectation
.
<EOS>
as
she
find
her
mistress
,
therefore
,
incline
to
relent
,
she
think
proper
also
to
put
on
some
small
condescension
,
which
be
as
readily
accept
;
and
so
the
affair
be
reconcile
,
all
offence
forgive
,
and
a
present
of
a
gown
and
petticoat
make
her
,
as
an
instance
of
her
lady
's
future
favour
.
  
<EOS>
She
offer
once
or
twice
to
speak
in
favour
of
Joseph
;
but
find
her
lady
's
heart
<EOS>
so
obdurate
,
that
she
prudently
dropt
all
such
effort
.
<EOS>
She
consider
there
be
more
footman
in
the
house
,
and
some
as
stout
fellow
,
though
not
quite
so
handsome
,
as
Joseph
;
besides
,
the
reader
hath
already
see
her
tender
advance
have
not
meet
with
the
encouragement
she
may
have
reasonable
expect
.
<EOS>
She
think
she
have
throw
away
a
great
deal
of
sack
and
sweetmeat
on
an
ungrateful
rascal
;
and
,
be
a
little
inclined
to
the
opinion
of
that
female
sect
,
who
hold
one
lusty
young
fellow
to
be
nearly
as
good
as
another
lusty
young
fellow
,
she
at
last
give
up
Joseph
and
his
cause
,
and
,
with
a
triumph
over
her
passion
highly
commendable
,
walk
off
with
her
present
,
and
with
great
tranquillity
pay
a
visit
to
a
stone
-
bottle
,
which
be
of
sovereign
use
to
a
philosophical
temper
.
  
<EOS>
She
leave
not
her
mistress
so
easy
.
<EOS>
the
poor
lady
could
not
reflect
without
agony
that
her
dear
reputation
be
in
the
power
of
her
servant
.
<EOS>
all
her
comfort
as
to
Joseph
be
,
that
she
hope
he
do
not
understand
her
meaning
;
at
least
she
could
say
for
herself
,
she
have
not
plainly
express
anything
to
him
;
and
as
to
Mrs
Slipslop
,
she
imagine
she
could
bribe
her
to
secrecy
.
  
<EOS>
but
what
hurt
her
most
be
,
that
in
reality
she
have
not
so
entirely
conquer
her
passion
;
the
little
god
lie
lurk
in
her
heart
,
though
anger
and
distain
<EOS>
so
hood
-
wink
her
,
that
she
could
not
see
him
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
thousand
time
on
the
very
brink
of
revoke
the
sentence
she
have
pass
against
the
poor
youth
.
<EOS>
Love
become
his
advocate
,
and
whisper
many
thing
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
honour
likewise
endeavour
to
vindicate
his
crime
,
and
pity
to
mitigate
his
punishment
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
side
,
Pride
and
Revenge
speak
as
loudly
against
him
.
<EOS>
and
thus
the
poor
lady
be
torture
with
perplexity
,
opposite
passion
distract
and
tear
her
mind
different
way
.
  
<EOS>
so
have
I
see
,
in
the
hall
of
Westminster
,
where
serjeant
bramble
hath
be
retain
on
the
right
side
,
and
Serjeant
Puzzle
on
the
left
,
the
balance
of
opinion
(
so
equal
be
their
fee
)
<EOS>
alternately
incline
to
either
scale
.
<EOS>
now
bramble
throw
in
an
argument
,
and
Puzzle
's
scale
strike
the
beam
;
again
bramble
share
the
like
fate
,
overpower
by
the
weight
of
Puzzle
.
<EOS>
here
bramble
hit
,
there
puzzle
strike
;
here
one
have
you
,
there
t'other
have
you
;
till
at
last
all
become
one
scene
of
confusion
in
the
tortured
mind
of
the
hearer
;
equal
wager
be
lay
on
the
success
,
and
neither
judge
nor
jury
can
possibly
make
anything
of
the
matter
;
all
thing
be
so
envelop
by
the
careful
serjeant
in
doubt
and
obscurity
.
  
<EOS>
or
,
as
it
happen
in
the
conscience
,
where
honour
and
honesty
pull
one
way
,
and
a
bribe
and
necessity
another
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
be
our
present
business
only
to
make
simile
,
we
could
produce
many
more
to
this
purpose
;
but
a
simile
(
as
well
as
a
word
)
to
the
wise
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
therefore
see
a
little
after
our
hero
,
for
whom
the
reader
be
doubtless
in
some
pain
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
Joseph
write
another
letter
:
his
transaction
with
Mr
Peter
Pounce
,
&
c.
,
with
his
departure
from
Lady
Booby
.
  
<EOS>
the
disconsolate
Joseph
would
not
have
have
an
understanding
sufficient
for
the
principal
subject
of
such
a
book
as
this
,
if
he
have
any
longer
misunderstood
<EOS>
the
drift
of
his
mistress
;
and
indeed
,
that
he
do
not
discern
it
sooner
,
the
reader
will
be
pleased
to
impute
to
an
unwillingness
in
him
to
discover
what
he
must
condemn
in
her
as
a
fault
.
<EOS>
have
therefore
quit
her
presence
,
he
retire
into
his
own
garret
,
and
enter
himself
into
an
ejaculation
on
the
numberless
calamity
which
attend
beauty
,
and
the
misfortune
it
be
to
be
handsome
than
one
's
neighbour
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
sit
down
,
and
address
himself
to
his
sister
Pamela
in
the
follow
word
:
    
"
Dear
Sister
Pamela
,
 
<EOS>
hope
you
be
well
,
what
news
have
I
to
tell
you
!
<EOS>
o
Pamela
!
<EOS>
my
mistress
be
fall
in
love
with
me
-
<EOS>
that
is
,
what
great
folk
call
fall
in
love
-
she
have
a
mind
to
ruin
me
;
but
I
hope
I
shall
have
more
resolution
and
more
grace
than
to
part
with
my
virtue
to
any
lady
upon
earth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Adams
hath
often
tell
me
,
that
chastity
be
as
great
a
virtue
in
a
man
as
in
a
woman
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
never
know
any
more
than
his
wife
,
and
I
shall
endeavour
to
follow
his
example
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
owe
entirely
to
his
excellent
sermon
and
advice
,
together
with
your
letter
,
that
I
have
be
able
to
resist
a
temptation
,
which
,
he
say
,
no
man
comply
with
,
but
he
repent
in
this
world
,
or
be
damned
for
it
in
the
next
;
and
why
should
I
trust
to
repentance
on
my
deathbed
,

I
may
die
in
my
sleep
?
<EOS>
what
fine
thing
be
good
advice
and
good
example
!
<EOS>
but
I
be
glad
she
turn
me
out
of
the
chamber
as
she
do
:
<EOS>
for
I
have
once
almost
forget
every
word
parson
Adams
have
ever
say
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
doubt
,
dear
sister
,
but
you
will
have
grace
to
preserve
your
virtue
against
all
trial
;
and
I
beg
you
earnestly
to
pray
I
may
be
enable
to
preserve
mine
;
for
truly
it
be
very
severely
attack
by
more
than
one
;
but
I
hope
I
shall
copy
your
example
,
and
that
of
Joseph
my
namesake
,
and
maintain
my
virtue
against
all
temptation
.

"
  
<EOS>
Joseph
have
not
finish
his
letter
,
when
he
be
summon
downstairs
by
Mr
Peter
Pounce
,
to
receive
his
wage
;
for
,
besides
that
out
of
eight
pound
a
year
he
allow
his
father
and
mother
four
,
he
have
be
oblige
,
in
order
to
furnish
himself
with
musical
instrument
,
to
apply
to
the
generosity
of
the
aforesaid
Peter
,
who
,
on
urgent
occasion
,
use
to
advance
the
servant
their
wage
:
not
before
they
be
due
,
but
before
they
be
payable
;
that
is
,
perhaps
,
half
a
year
after
they
be
due
;
and
this
at
the
moderate
premium
of
fifty
per
cent
,
or
a
little
more
:
by
which
charitable
method
,
together
with
lend
money
to
other
people
,
and
even
to
his
own
master
and
mistress
,
the
honest
man
have
,
from
nothing
,
in
a
few
year
amass
a
small
sum
of
twenty
thousand
pound
or
thereabout
.
  
<EOS>
Joseph
have
receive
his
little
remainder
of
wage
,
and
have
stript
off
his
livery
,
be
force
to
borrow
a
frock
and
breech
of
one
of
the
servant
(
for
he
be
so
beloved
in
the
family
,
that
they
would
all
have
lend
him
anything
)
:
and
,
be
tell
by
Peter
that
he
must
not
stay
a
moment
longer
in
the
house
than
be
necessary
to
pack
up
his
linen
,
which
he
easily
do
in
a
very
narrow
compass
,
he
take
a
melancholy
leave
of
his
fellow
-
servant
,
and
set
out
at
seven
in
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
proceed
the
length
of
two
or
three
street
,
before
he
absolutely
determine
with
himself
whether
he
should
leave
the
town
that
night
,
or
,
procure
a
lodging
,
wait
till
the
morning
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
the
moon
shine
very
bright
help
him
to
come
to
a
resolution
of
begin
his
journey
immediately
,
to
which
likewise
he
have
some
other
inducement
;
which
the
reader
,
without
be
a
conjurer
,
can
not
possibly
guess
,
till
we
have
give
him
those
hint
which
it
may
be
now
proper
to
open
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
of
several
new
matter
not
expect
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
an
observation
sometimes
make
,
that
to
indicate
our
idea
of
a
simple
fellow
,
we
say
,
he
be
easily
to
be
see
through
:
nor
do
I
believe
it
a
more
improper
denotation
of
a
simple
book
.
<EOS>
instead
of
apply
this
to
any
particular
performance
,
we
chuse
rather
to
remark
the
contrary
in
this
history
,
where
the
scene
open
itself
by
small
degree
;
and
he
be
a
sagacious
reader
who
can
see
two
chapter
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
for
this
reason
,
we
have
not
hitherto
hint
a
matter
which
now
seem
necessary
to
be
explain
;
since
it
may
be
wonder
at
,
first
,
that
Joseph
make
such
extraordinary
haste
out
of
town
,
which
hath
be
already
shew
;
and
secondly
,
which
will
be
now
shew
,
that
,
instead
of
proceed
to
the
habitation
of
his
father
and
mother
,
or
to
his
beloved
sister
Pamela
,
he
choose
rather
to
set
out
full
speed
to
the
Lady
Booby
's
country
-
seat
,
which
he
have
leave
on
his
journey
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
be
it
know
,
then
,
that
in
the
same
parish
where
this
seat
stand
there
live
a
young
girl
whom
Joseph
(
though
the
good
of
son
and
brother
)
long
more
impatiently
to
see
than
his
parent
or
his
sister
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
poor
girl
,
who
have
formerly
be
breed
up
in
Sir
John
's
family
;
whence
,
a
little
before
the
journey
to
London
,
<EOS>
she
have
be
discard
by
Mrs
Slipslop
,
on
account
of
her
extraordinary
beauty
:
for
I
never
could
find
any
other
reason
.
  
<EOS>
this
young
creature
(
who
now
live
with
a
farmer
in
the
parish
)
have
be
always
beloved
by
Joseph
,
and
return
his
affection
.
<EOS>
She
be
two
year
only
young
than
our
hero
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
acquaint
from
their
infancy
,
and
have
conceive
a
very
early
like
for
each
other
;
which
have
grow
to
such
a
degree
of
affection
,
that
Mr
Adams
have
with
much
ado
prevent
them
from
marry
,
and
persuade
them
to
wait
till
a
few
year
'
service
and
thrift
have
a
little
improved
their
experience
,
and
enable
them
to
live
comfortably
together
.
  
<EOS>
They
follow
this
good
man
's
advice
,
as
indeed
his
word
be
little
less
than
a
law
in
his
parish
;
for
as
he
have
show
his
parishioner
,
by
an
uniform
behaviour
of
thirty
-
five
year
'
duration
,
that
he
have
their
good
entirely
at
heart
,
so
they
consult
him
on
every
occasion
,
and
very
seldom
act
contrary
to
his
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
can
be
imagine
more
tender
than
be
the
parting
between
these
two
lover
.
<EOS>
a
thousand
sigh
heave
the
bosom
of
Joseph
,
a
thousand
tear
distil
from
the
lovely
eye
of
Fanny
(
for
that
be
her
name
)
.
<EOS>
though
her
modesty
would
only
suffer
her
to
admit
his
eager
kiss
,
her
violent
love
make
her
more
than
passive
in
his
embrace
;
and
she
often
pull
him
to
her
breast
with
a
soft
pressure
,
which
though
perhaps
it
would
not
have
squeeze
an
insect
to
death
,
cause
more
emotion
in
the
heart
of
Joseph
than
the
close
cornish
hug
could
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
may
perhaps
wonder
that
so
fond
a
pair
should
,
during
a
twelvemonth
's
absence
,
never
converse
with
one
another
:
indeed
,
there
be
but
one
reason
which
do
or
could
have
prevent
them
;
and
this
be
,
that
poor
Fanny
could
neither
write
nor
read
:
nor
could
she
be
prevail
upon
to
transmit
the
delicacy
of
her
tender
and
chaste
passion
by
the
hand
of
an
amanuensis
.
  
<EOS>
They
content
themselves
therefore
with
frequent
inquiry
after
each
other
's
health
,
with
a
mutual
confidence
in
each
other
's
fidelity
,
and
the
prospect
of
their
future
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
have
explain
these
matter
to
our
reader
,
and
,
as
far
as
possible
,
satisfy
all
his
doubt
,
we
return
to
honest
Joseph
,
whom
we
leave
just
set
out
on
his
travel
by
the
light
of
the
moon
.
  
<EOS>
those
who
have
read
any
romance
or
poetry
,
antient
or
modern
,
must
have
be
inform
<EOS>
that
love
hath
wing
:
by
which
they
be
not
to
understand
,
as
some
young
lady
by
mistake
have
do
,
that
a
lover
can
fly
;
the
writer
,
by
this
ingenious
allegory
,
intend
to
insinuate
no
more
than
that
lover
do
not
march
like
horse
-
guard
;
in
short
,
that
they
put
the
good
leg
foremost
;
which
our
lusty
youth
,
who
could
walk
with
any
man
,
do
so
heartily
on
this
occasion
,
that
within
four
hour
he
reach
a
famous
house
of
hospitality
well
know
to
the
western
traveller
.
<EOS>
It
present
you
a
lion
on
the
sign
-
post
:
and
the
master
,
who
be
christen
Timotheus
,
be
commonly
call
plain
Tim
.
<EOS>
some
have
conceive
that
he
hath
particularly
choose
the
lion
for
his
sign
,
as
he
doth
in
countenance
greatly
resemble
that
magnanimous
beast
,
though
his
disposition
savour
more
of
the
sweetness
of
the
lamb
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
person
well
receive
among
all
sort
of
man
,
be
qualified
to
render
himself
agreeable
to
any
;
as
he
be
well
verse
in
history
and
politic
,
hath
a
smattering
in
law
and
divinity
,
crack
a
good
jest
,
and
play
wonderfully
well
on
the
french
horn
.
  
<EOS>
a
violent
storm
of
hail
force
Joseph
to
take
shelter
in
this
inn
,
where
he
remember
Sir
Thomas
have
dine
in
his
way
to
town
.
<EOS>
Joseph
have
no
sooner
seat
himself
by
the
kitchen
fire
than
Timotheus
,
observe
his
livery
,
begin
to
condole
the
loss
of
his
late
master
;
who
be
,
he
say
,
his
very
particular
and
intimate
acquaintance
,
with
whom
he
have
crack
many
a
merry
bottle
,
ay
many
a
dozen
,
in
his
time
.
<EOS>
He
then
remark
,
that
all
these
thing
be
over
now
,
all
pass
,
and
just
as
if
they
have
never
be
;
and
conclude
with
an
excellent
observation
on
the
certainty
of
death
,
which
his
wife
say
be
indeed
very
true
.
<EOS>
a
fellow
now
arrive
at
the
same
inn
with
two
horse
,
one
of
which
he
be
lead
farther
down
into
the
country
to
meet
his
master
;
these
he
put
into
the
stable
,
and
come
and
take
his
place
by
Joseph
's
side
,
who
immediately
know
him
to
be
the
servant
of
a
neighbour
gentleman
,
who
use
to
visit
at
their
house
.
  
<EOS>
this
fellow
be
likewise
force
in
by
the
storm
;
for
he
have
order
to
go
twenty
mile
farther
that
evening
,
and
luckily
on
the
same
road
which
Joseph
himself
intend
to
take
.
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
embrace
this
opportunity
of
compliment
his
friend
with
his
master
's
horse
(
notwithstanding
he
have
receive
express
command
to
the
contrary
)
,
which
be
readily
accept
;
and
so
,
after
they
have
drink
a
love
pot
,
and
the
storm
be
over
,
they
set
out
together
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
contain
many
surprizing
adventure
which
Joseph
Andrews
meet
with
on
the
road
,
scarce
credible
to
those
who
have
never
travel
in
a
stage
-
coach
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
remarkable
happen
on
the
road
till
their
arrival
at
the
inn
to
which
the
horse
be
order
;
whither
they
come
about
two
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
the
moon
then
shine
very
bright
;
and
Joseph
,
make
his
friend
a
present
of
a
pint
of
wine
,
and
thank
him
for
the
favour
of
his
horse
,
notwithstanding
all
entreaty
to
the
contrary
,
proceed
on
his
journey
on
foot
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
not
go
above
two
mile
,
charm
with
the
hope
of
shortly
see
his
beloved
Fanny
,
when
he
be
meet
by
two
fellow
in
a
narrow
lane
,
and
order
to
stand
and
deliver
.
<EOS>
He
readily
give
them
all
the
money
he
have
,
which
be
somewhat
less
than
two
pound
;
and
tell
them
he
hope
they
would
be
so
generous
as
to
return
him
a
few
shilling
,
to
defray
his
charge
on
his
way
home
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
the
ruffian
answer
with
an
oath
,
"
yes
,
we
will
give
you
something
presently
:
but
first
strip
and
be
d####n'd
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Strip
,
"
cry
the
other
,
"
or
I
will
blow
your
brain
to
the
devil
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Joseph
,
remember
that
he
have
borrow
his
coat
and
breech
of
a
friend
,
and
that
he
should
be
ashamed
of
make
any
excuse
for
not
return
them
,
reply
,
he
hope
they
would
not
insist
on
his
clothe
,
which
be
not
worth
much
,
but
consider
the
coldness
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
cold
,
be
you
,
you
rascal
?
"
say
one
of
the
robber
:
"
I
will
warm
you
with
a
vengeance
;
"
and
,
damn
his
eye
,
snap
a
pistol
at
his
head
;
which
he
have
no
sooner
do
than
the
other
level
a
blow
at
him
with
his
stick
,
which
Joseph
,
who
be
expert
at
cudgel
-
play
,
catch
with
his
,
and
return
the
favour
so
successfully
on
his
adversary
,
that
he
lay
him
sprawl
at
his
foot
,
and
at
the
same
instant
receive
a
blow
from
behind
,
with
the
butt
end
of
a
pistol
,
from
the
other
villain
,
which
fell
him
to
the
ground
,
and
totally
deprive
him
of
his
sense
.
  
<EOS>
the
thief
who
have
be
knock
down
have
now
recover
himself
;
and
both
together
fall
to
belabour
poor
Joseph
with
their
stick
,
till
they
be
convince
they
have
put
an
end
to
his
miserable
being
:
they
then
strip
him
entirely
naked
,
throw
him
into
a
ditch
,
and
depart
with
their
booty
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
wretch
,
who
lie
motionless
a
long
time
,
just
begin
to
recover
his
sense
as
a
stage

by

<EOS>
the
postillion
,
hear
a
man
's
groan
,
stopt
his
horse
,
and
tell
the
coachman
he
be
certain
there
be
a
dead
man
lie
in
the
ditch
,
for
he
hear
him
groan
.
<EOS>
"
go
on
,
sirrah

"
say
the
coachman
;
"
we
be
confound
late
,
and
have
no
time
to
look
after
dead
man

"
<EOS>
a
lady
,
who
hear
what
the
postillion
say
,
and
likewise
hear
the
groan
,
call
eagerly
to
the
coachman
to
stop
and
see
what
be
the
matter
.
<EOS>
upon
which
he
bid
the
postillion
alight
,
and
look
into
the
ditch
.
<EOS>
He
do
so
,
and
return
,
"
that
there
be
a
man

upright

as
naked
as

<EOS>
"
O
J
 
sus

<EOS>
"
cry
the
lady
;
"
a
naked
man
!
<EOS>
dear
coachman
,
drive
on
and
leave
him
.
"
<EOS>
upon
this
the
gentleman
get
out
of
the
coach
;
and
Joseph
beg
them
to
have
mercy
upon
him
:
for
that
he
have
be
rob
and
almost
beat
to
death
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
rob
!
<EOS>
"
cry
an
old
gentleman
:
"
let
us
make
all
the
haste
imaginable
,
or
we
shall
be
rob
too
.
"
<EOS>
a
young
man
who
belong
to
the
law
answer
,
"
He
wish
they
have
pass
by
without
take
any
notice
;
but
that
now
they
may
be
prove
to
have
be
last
in
his
company
;
if
he
should
die
they
may
be
call
to
some
account
for
his
murder

<EOS>
He
therefore
think
it
advisable
to
save
the
poor
creature
's
life
,
for
their
own
sake
,
if
possible
;
at

if

to
prevent
the

finding

<EOS>
He
be
therefore
of
opinion

take
the

not
come
into
the
coach

<EOS>
that
if
they
lift
him
in
,
she
would
herself
alight
:
for
she
have
rather
stay
in
that
place
to
all
eternity
than
ride
with
a
naked
man
.
"
<EOS>
the
coachman
object
,
"
that
he
could
not
suffer
him
to
be
take
in
unless
somebody
would
pay
a
shilling
for
his
carriage
the
four
mile
.
"
<EOS>
which
the
two
gentleman
refuse
to
do
.
<EOS>
but
the
lawyer
,
who
be
afraid
of
some
mischief
happen
to
himself
,
if
the
wretch
be
leave
behind
in
that
condition
,
say
no
man
could
be
too
cautious
in
these
matter
,
and
that
he
remember
very
extraordinary
case
in
the
book
,
threaten
the
coachman
,
and
bid
him
deny
take
him
up
at
his
peril
;
for
that
,
if
he
die
,
he
should
be
indict
for
his
murder
;
and
if
he
live
,
and
bring
an
action
against
him
,
he
would
willingly
take
a
brief
in
it
.
<EOS>
these
word
have
a
sensible
effect
on
the
coachman
,
who
be
well
acquaint
with
the
person
who
speak
them
;
and
the
old
gentleman
above
mention
,
think
the
naked
man
would
afford
him
frequent
opportunity
of
show
his
wit
to
the
lady
,
offer
to
join
with
the
company
in
give
a
mug
of
beer
for
his
fare
;
till
,
partly
alarm
by
the
threat
of
the
one
,
and
partly
by
the
promise
of
the
other
,
and
be
perhaps
a
little
moved
with
compassion
at
the
poor
creature
's
condition
,
who
stand
bleed
and
shiver
with
the
cold
,
he
at
length
agree
;

Joseph
be
now
advance
to
the
coach
,
where
,
see
the
lady
,
who
hold
the
stick
of
her
fan
before
her
eye

he
absolutely
refuse
,
miserable
as
he
be
,
to
enter

unless
he
be
furnish
with
sufficient
covering
to
prevent
give
the
least
offence
to
decency
 
<EOS>
so
perfectly
modest
be
this
young
man
;
such
mighty
effect
have
the
spotless
example
of
the
amiable
Pamela
,
and
the
excellent
sermon
of
Mr
Adams
,
work
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
though
there
be
several
greatcoat
about
the
coach
,
it
be
not
easy
to
get
over
this
difficulty
which
Joseph
have
start
.
<EOS>
the
two
gentleman
complain
they
be
cold
,
and
could
not
spare
a
rag
;
the
man
of
wit
say
,
with
a
laugh
,
that
charity
begin
at

the
coachman
,
who
have
two
greatcoat
spread
under
him
,
refuse
to
lend
either
,
lest
they
should
be
make
bloody
:
the
lady

footman
desire
to
be
excuse
for
the
same
reason
,
which
the
lady
herself
,
notwithstanding
her
abhorrence
of
a
naked
man
,
approve
:
and
it
be
more
than
probable
poor
Joseph
,
who
obstinately
adhere
to
his
modest
resolution
,
must
have
perish
,
unless
the
postillion
(
a
lad
who
hath
be
since
transport
for
rob
a
hen

roost
)
<EOS>
have
voluntarily
stript
off
a
greatcoat

his
only
garment
,
at
the
same
time
swear
a
great
oath
(
for
which
he
be
rebuke
by
the
passenger
)
,
"
that
he
would
rather
ride
in
his
shirt
all
his
life

suffer
a
fellow

creature
to
lie
in
so
miserable
a

<EOS>
Joseph

have
put
on
the
greatcoat
,
be
lift
into
the
coach

which
now
proceed
on
its
journey

<EOS>
He
declare
himself
almost
dead
with
the
cold
,
which
give
the
man
of
wit
an
occasion
to
ask
the
lady
if
she
could
not
accommodate
him
with
a
dram
.
<EOS>
She
answer
,
with
some
resentment
,
"
She
wonder
at
his
ask
her
such
a
question
;
but
assure
him
she
never
taste
any
such
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
lawyer
be
inquire
into
the
circumstance
of
the
robbery
,
when
the
coach
stopt
,
and
one
of
the
ruffian
,
put
a
pistol
in
,
demand
their
money
of
the
passenger
,
who
readily
give
it
them
;
and
the
lady
,
in
her
fright
,
deliver
up
a
little
silver
bottle
,
of
about
a
half
-
pint
size
,
which
the
rogue
,
clap
it
to
his
mouth
,
and
drink
her
health
,
declare
,
hold
some
of
the
good
Nantes
he
have
ever
taste
:
<EOS>
this
the
lady
afterwards
assure
the
company
be
the
mistake
of
her
maid
,
for
that
she
have
order
her
to
fill
the
bottle
with
Hungary
-
water
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
fellow
be
depart
,
the
lawyer
,
who
have
,
it
seem
,
a
case
of
pistol
in
the
seat
of
the
coach
,
inform
the
company
,
that
if
it
have
be
daylight
,
and
he
could
have
come
at
his
pistol
,
he
would
not
have
submit
to
the
robbery
:
he
likewise
set
forth
that
he
have
often
meet
highwayman
when
he
travel
on
horseback
,
but
none
ever
durst
attack
him
;
conclude
that
,
if
he
have
not
be
more
afraid
for
the
lady
than
for
himself
,
he
should
not
have
now
part
with
his
money
so
easily
.
  
<EOS>
as
wit
be
generally
observe
to
love
to
reside
in
empty
pocket
,
so
the
gentleman
whose
ingenuity
we
have
above
remark
,
as
soon
as
he
have
part
with
his
money
,
begin
to
grow
wonderfully
facetious
.
<EOS>
He
make
frequent
allusion
to
Adam
and
Eve
,
and
say
many
excellent
thing
on
fig
and
fig
-
leave
;
which
perhaps
give
more
offence
to
Joseph
than
to
any
other
in
the
company
.
  
<EOS>
the
lawyer
likewise
make
several
very
pretty
jest
without
depart
from
his
profession
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
if
Joseph
and
the
lady
be
alone
,
he
would
be
more
capable
of
make
a
conveyance
to
her
,
as
his
affair
be
not
fetter
with
any
incumbrance
;
he
would
warrant
he
soon
suffer
a
recovery
by
a
writ
of
entry
,
which
be
the
proper
way
to
create
heir
in
tail
;
that
,
for
his
own
part
,
he
would
engage
to
make
so
firm
a
settlement
in
a
coach
,
that
there
should
be
no
danger
of
an
ejectment
,
"
with
an
inundation
of
the
like
gibberish
,
which
he
continue
to
vent
till
the
coach
arrive
at
an
inn
,
where
one
servant
-
maid
only
be
up
,
in
readiness
to
attend
the
coachman
,
and
furnish
him
with
cold
meat
and
a
dram

<EOS>
Joseph
desire
to
alight
,
and
that
he
may
have
a
bed
prepare
for
him
,
which
the
maid
readily
promise
to
perform
;
and
,
be
a
good
-
natured
wench
,
and
not
so
squeamish
as
the
lady
have
be
,
she
clapt
a
large
fagot
on
the
fire
,
and
,
furnish
Joseph
with
a
greatcoat
belong
to
one
of
the
hostler
,
desire
him
to
sit
down
and
warm
himself
whilst
she
make
his
bed

<EOS>
the
coachman
,
in
the
meantime
,
take
an
opportunity
to
call
up
a
surgeon
,
who
live
within
a
few
door
;
after
which
,
he
remind
his
passenger
how
late
they
be
,
and
,
after
they
have
take
leave
of
Joseph

hurry
them
off
as
fast
as
he
could
.
  
<EOS>
the
wench
soon
get
Joseph
to
bed
,
and
promise
to
use
her
interest
to
borrow
him
a

;
but
imagine
,
as
she
afterwards
say
,
by
his
be
so
bloody
,
that
he
must
be
a
dead
man
<EOS>
,
she
run
with
all
speed
to
hasten
the

,
who
be
more
than
half
dr

apprehend
that
the
coach
have
be
overturn

some

<EOS>
as
soon

<EOS>
what
happen
to
Joseph
during
his
sickness
at

with
the
curious
discourse

the

have
communicate

ask
the

to

the
surgeon
very
honestly
answer

He
fear
he
be
;
for
that
his
pulse
be
very
exalted

feverish

it

the

advise
him

if
he
have
any
worldly
affair
to
settle

that
he
would
do
it
as
soon

,
though
he
hope
he
may
recover
,
yet
he
think
himself
oblige
to
acquaint
him
he
be
in
great
danger
;
and
if
the
malign
concoction
of
his
humours
should
cause
a
suscitation
of
his
fever

he
may
soon
grow
delirious

incapable
to
make
his
will

<EOS>
Joseph
answer
,
"
that
it
be
impossible
for
any
creature
in
the
universe
to
be
in
a
poor
condition

himself

for
since
the
robbery
he
have
not
one
thing

he
could
call
his

I
have

piece

gold

they
take
away

that
would
have
be
a
comfort

all
my
affliction

surely

I
want
nothing

Mr

have
open

the
sick
man
talk
to
himself
in
the
follow
manner
:
    
"
o
most
adorable
Pamela
!
<EOS>
most
virtuous
sister
!
<EOS>
whose
example
could
alone
enable
me
to
withstand
all
the
temptation
of
rich
and
beauty
,
and
to
preserve
my
virtue
pure
and
chaste
for
the
arm
of
my
dear
Fanny
,
if
it
have
please
Heaven
that
I
should
ever
have
come
unto
them
.
<EOS>
what
riche
,
or
honour
,
or
pleasure
,
can
make
us
amend
for
the
loss
of
innocence
?
<EOS>
Doth
not
that
alone
afford
us
more
consolation
than
all
worldly
acquisition
?
<EOS>
what
but
innocence
and
virtue
could
give
any
comfort
to
such
a
miserable
wretch
as
I
be
?
<EOS>
yet
these
can
make
me
prefer
this
sick
and
painful
bed
to
all
the
pleasure
I
should
have
find
in
my
lady
's
.
<EOS>
these
can
make
me
face
death
without
fear
;
and
though
I
love
my
Fanny
more
than
ever
man
love
a
woman
,
these
can
teach
me
to
resign
myself
to
the
Divine
will
without
repine
.
<EOS>
o
thou
delightful
charming
creature
!
<EOS>
if
Heaven
have
indulge
thee
to
my
arm
,
the
poor
,
humblest
state
would
have
be
a
paradise
;
I
could
have
live
with
thee
in
the
low
cottage
without
envy
the
palace
,
the
dainty
,
or
the
rich
of
any
man
breathe
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
leave
thee
,
leave
thee
for
ever
,
my
dear
angel
!
<EOS>
I
must
think
of
another
world
;
and
I
heartily
pray
thou
may'st
meet
comfort
in
this
.

"
 
<EOS>
Barnabas
think
he
have
hear
enough
,
so
downstairs
he
go
,
and
tell
Tow
-
wouse
he
could
do
his
guest
no
service
;
for
that
he
be
very
light
-
headed
,
and
have
utter
nothing
but
a
rhapsody
of
nonsense
all
the
time
he
stay
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
the
surgeon
return
in
the
afternoon
,
and
find
his
patient
in
a
high
fever
,
as
he
say
,
than
when
he
leave
him
,
though
not
delirious

for

notwithstanding
Mr
Barnabas
's
opinion
,
he
have
not

once
out

since
his
arrival
at

<EOS>
Mr
Barnabas
be
again
send
for
,
and
with
much
difficulty
prevail
on
to
make
another
visit
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
enter
the
room
he
tell
Joseph
"
He
be
come
to
pray
by
him
,
and
to
prepare
him
for
another
world
:
in
the
first
place
,
therefore
,
he
hope
he
have
repent
of
all
his
sin
.
"
<EOS>
Joseph
answer
,
"
He
hope
he
have
;
but
there
be
one
thing
which
he
know
not
whether
he
should
call
a
sin
;
if
it
be
,
he
fear
he
should
die
in
the
commission
of
it
;
and
that
be
,
the
regret
of
part
with
a
young
woman
whom
he
love
as
tenderly
as
he
do
his
heart
-
string
.
"
<EOS>
Barnabas
bad
him
be
assure
"
that
any
repining
at
the
Divine
will
be
one
of
the
great
sin
he
could
commit
;
that
he
ought
to
forget
all
carnal
affection
,
and
think
of
well
thing
.
"
<EOS>
Joseph
say
,
"
that
neither
in
this
world
nor
the
next
he
could
forget
his
Fanny
;
and
that
the
thought
,
however
grievous
,
of
part
from
her
for
ever
,
be
not
half
so
tormenting
as
the
fear
of
what
she
would
suffer
when
she
know
his
misfortune
.
"
<EOS>
Barnabas
say
,
"
that
such
fear
argue
a
diffidence
and
despondence
very
criminal
;
that
he
must
divest
himself
of
all
human
passion
,
and
fix
his
heart
above
.
"
<EOS>
Joseph
answer
,
"
that
be
what
he
desire
to
do
,
and
should
be
oblige
to
him
if
he
would
enable
him
to
accomplish
it
.
"
<EOS>
Barnabas
reply
,
"
that
must
be
do
by
grace
.
"
<EOS>
Joseph
besought
him
to
discover
how
he
may
attain
it
.
<EOS>
Barnabas
answer
,
"
by
prayer
and
faith
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
question
him
concern
his
forgiveness
of
the
thief
.
<EOS>
Joseph
answer
,
"
He
fear
that
be
more
than
he
could
do
;
for
nothing
would
give
him
more
pleasure
than
to
hear
they
be
take

<EOS>
"
that
,
"
cry
Barnabas
,
"
be
for
the
sake
of
justice
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Joseph
,
"
but
if
I
be
to
meet
them
again
,
I
be
afraid
I
should
attack
them
,
and
kill
them
too
,
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
doubtless
,
"
answer
Barnabas
,
"
it
be
lawful
to
kill
a
thief
;
but
can
you
say
you
forgive
them
as
a
Christian
ought
?
"
<EOS>
Joseph
desire
to
know
what
that
forgiveness
be
.
<EOS>
"
that
is
,
"
answer
Barnabas
,
"
to
forgive
them
as
 
as
 
it
be
to
forgive
them
as
 
in
short
,
it
be
to
forgive
them
as
a
Christian
.
"
  
<EOS>
Joseph
reply
,
"
He
forgive
them
as
much
as
he
could
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
"
say
Barnabas
,
"
that
will
do
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
demand
of
him
,
"
if
he
remember
any
more
sin
unrepented
of
;
and
if
he
do
,
he
desire
him
to
make
haste
and
repent
of
them
as
fast
as
he
could
,
that
they
may
repeat
over
a
few
prayer
together
.
"
<EOS>
Joseph
answer
,
"
He
could
not
recollect
any
great
crime
he
have
be
guilty
of
,
and
that
those
he
have
commit
he
be
sincerely
sorry
for
.
"
<EOS>
Barnabas
say
that
be
enough
,
and
then
proceed
to
prayer
with
all
the
expedition
he
be
master
of
,
some
company
then
wait
for
him
below
in
the
parlour
,
where
the
ingredient
for
punch

but
no

<EOS>
Joseph

Joseph

as
soon

taste
it

he
fear
it
would
increase
his
fever

and
that

to
which
the
good

natured
Betty

he
should
have
tea

It

<EOS>
Mrs

Pox

"
I

<EOS>
and
indeed
,
if
Mrs

have
give
no
utterance
to
the
sweetness
of
her
temper
,
nature
have
take
such
pain
in
her
countenance

that
Hogarth

<EOS>
Her
person

thin

Her

thence
descend
in
a
declivity

It
be
not
easy
to
say
whether
the
gentleman
have
conceive
a
great
dislike
for
his
landlady
or
compassion
for

<EOS>
He
inquire
very
earnestly

who
be
now
come
into

whether

<EOS>
He
be
proceed
in
this
learned
manner
,
when
a
mighty
noise
interrupt
him
.
<EOS>
some
young
fellow
in
the
neighbourhood
have
take
one
of
the
thief
,
and
be
bring
him
into
the
inn
.
<EOS>
Betty
run
upstairs
with
this
news
to
Joseph
,
who
beg
they
may
search
for
a
little
piece
of
broken
gold
,
which
have
a
ribband
tie
to
it
,
and
which
he
could
swear
to
amongst
all
the
hoard
of
the
rich
man
in
the
universe
.
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
fellow
's
persisting
in
his
innocence
,
the
mob
be
very
busy
in
search
him
,
and
presently
,
among
other
thing
,
pull
out
the
piece
of
gold
just
mention
;
which
Betty
no
sooner
see
than
she
lay
violent
hand
on
it
,
and
convey
it
up
to
Joseph
,
who
receive
it
with
rapture
of
joy
,
and
,
hug
it
in
his
bosom
,
declare
he
could
now
die
contented
.
  
<EOS>
within
a
few
minute
afterwards
come
in
some
other
fellow
,
with
a
bundle
which
they
have
find
in
a
ditch
,
and
which
be
indeed
the
cloath
which
have
be
strip
off
from
Joseph
,
and
the
other
thing
they
have
take
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
gentleman
no
sooner
see
the
coat
than
he
declare
he
know
the
livery
;
and
,
if
it
have
be
take
from
the
poor
creature
above

stair

desire
he
may
see
him
;
for
that
he
be
very
well
acquaint
with
the
family
to
whom
that
livery
belong

<EOS>
He
be
accordingly
conduct
up
by
Betty
;
but
what
,
reader
,
be
the
surprize
on
both
side
,
when
he
see
Joseph
be
the
person
in
bed
,
and
when
Joseph
discover
the
face
of
his
good
friend
Mr
Abraham
Adams
!
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
impertinent
to
insert
a
discourse
which
chiefly
turn
on
the
relation
of
matter
already
well
known
to
the
reader
;
for
,
as
soon
as
the
curate
have
satisfy
Joseph
concern
the
perfect
health
of
his
Fanny
,
he
be
on
his
side
very
inquisitive
into
all
the
particular
which
have
produce
this
unfortunate
accident
.
  
<EOS>
to
return
therefore
to
the
kitchen
,
where
a
great
variety
of
company
be
now
assemble
from
all
the
room
of
the
house
,
as
well
as
the
neighbourhood
:
so
much
delight
do
man
take
in
contemplate
the
countenance
of
a
thief
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Tow
-
wouse
begin
to
rub
his
hand
with
pleasure
at
see
so
large
an
assembly
;
who
would
,
he
hope
,
shortly
adjourn
into
several
apartment
,
in
order
to
discourse
over
the
robbery
,
and
drink
a
health
to
all
honest
man
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs
Tow
-
wouse
,
whose
misfortune
it
be
commonly
to
see
thing
a
little
perversely
,
begin
to
rail
at
those
who
bring
the
fellow
into
her
house
;
tell
her
husband
,
"
They
be
very
likely
to
thrive
who
keep
a
house
of
entertainment
for
beggar
and
thief
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
mob
have
now
finish
their
search
,
and
could
find
nothing
about
the
captive
likely
to
prove
any
evidence
;
for
as
to
the
cloath
,
though
the
mob
be
very
well
satisfied
with
that
proof
,
yet
,
as
the
surgeon
observe
,
they
could
not
convict
him
,
because
they
be
not
find
in
his
custody
;
to
which
Barnabas
agree
,
and
add
that
these
be
bona
waviata
,
and
belong
to
the
lord
of
the
manor
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
,
"
say
the
surgeon
,
"
do
you
say
these
good
belong
to
the
lord
of
the
manor
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
cry
Barnabas
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
I
deny
it
,
"
say
the
surgeon
:
"
what
can
the
lord
of
the
manor
have
to
do
in
the
case
?
<EOS>
Will
any
one
attempt
to
persuade
me
that
what
a
man
find
be
not
his
own
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
,
"
say
an
old
fellow
in
the
corner
,
"
justice
Wise
-
one
say
,
that
,
if
every
man
have
his
right
,
whatever
be
find
belong
to
the
king
of
London
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
may
be
true
,
"
say
Barnabas
,
"
in
some
sense
;
for
the
law
make
a
difference
between
thing
steal
and
thing
find
;
for
a
thing
may
be
steal
that
never
be
find
,
and
a
thing
may
be
find
that
never
be
steal
:
now
,
good
that
be
both
steal
and
find
be
waviata
;
and
they
belong
to
the
lord
of
the
manor
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
the
lord
of
the
manor
be
the
receiver
of
steal
good
,
"
say
the
doctor
;
at
which
there
be
an
universal
laugh
,
be
first
begin
by
himself
.
  
<EOS>
while
the
prisoner
,
by
persist
in
his
innocence
,
have
almost
(
as
there
be
no
evidence
against
him
)
bring
over
Barnabas
,
the
surgeon
,
Tow

several
other
to
his
side

overlook
a
little
piece
of
gold
,
which
she
have
carry
up
to
the
man
in
bed
,
and
which
he
offer
to
swear
to
amongst
a
million
,
aye
,
amongst
ten
thousand
.
<EOS>
this
immediately
turn
the
scale
against
the
prisoner
,
and
every
one
now
conclude
him
guilty
.
<EOS>
It
be
resolve
,
therefore
,
to
keep
him
secure
that
night
,
and
early
in
the
morning
to
carry
him
before
a
justice
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
show
how
Mrs
Tow
-
wouse
be
a
little
mollified
;
and
how
officious
Mr
Barnabas
and
the
surgeon
be
to
prosecute
the
thief
:
with
a
dissertation
account
for
their
zeal
,
and
that
of
many
other
person
not
mention
in
this
history
.
  
<EOS>
Betty
tell
her
mistress
she
believe
the
man
in
bed
be
a
great
man
than
they
take
him
for
;
for
,
besides
the
extreme
whiteness
of
his
skin
,
and
the
softness
of
his
hand
,
she
observe
a
very
great
familiarity
between
the
gentleman
and
him
;
and
add
,
she
be
certain
they
be
intimate
acquaintance
,
if
not
relation
.
  
<EOS>
this
somewhat
abate
the
severity
of
Mrs
Tow

wouse
's
countenance
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
"
God
forbid
<EOS>
she
should
not

the
duty

<EOS>
She
have
a
natural
antipathy
to
vagabond

but
could
pity
the
misfortune
of
a
Christian
as
soon
as
another

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tow

say
,
"
if
the
traveller
be
a

though
he
hath
no
money
about

we

hereafter

so
you
may
begin

"
<EOS>
Mrs

wouse
answer
,
"
hold
your
simple
tongue
,
and
do
not
instruct
me
in

<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
be
sorry
for
the
gentleman

misfortune
with
all
my
heart

I
hope
the
villain
who
hath
use
him
so
barbarously
will
be
hang

<EOS>
Betty
,
go
see
what
he
want

<EOS>
God
forbid
he
should
want
anything
in
my
house

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Barnabas
and
the
surgeon
go
up
to
Joseph
to
satisfy
themselves
concern
the
piece
of
gold
;
Joseph
be
with
difficulty
prevail
upon
to
show
it
them
,
but
would
by
no
entreaty
be
bring
to
deliver
it
out
of
his
own
possession
.
<EOS>
He
however
attest
this
to
be
the
same
which
have
be
take
from
him
,
and
Betty
be
ready
to
swear
to
the
find
it
on
the
thief
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
difficulty
that
remain
be
,
how
to
produce
this
gold
before
the
justice
;
for
as
to
carry
Joseph
himself
,
it
seem
impossible
;
nor
be
there
any
great
likelihood
of
obtain
it
from
him
,
for
he
have
fasten
it
with
a
ribband
to
his
arm
,
and
solemnly
vow
that
nothing
but
irresistible
force
should
ever
separate
them
;
in
which
resolution
,
Mr
Adams
,
clench
a
fist
rather
less
than
the
knuckle
of
an
ox
,
declare
he
would
support
him
.
  
<EOS>
a
dispute
arise
on
this
occasion
concern
evidence
not
very
necessary
to
be
relate
here
;
after
which
the
surgeon
dress
Mr
Joseph
's
head
,
still
persist
in
the
imminent
danger
in
which
his
patient
lie
,
but
conclude
,
with
a
very
important
look
,
"
that
he
begin
to
have
some
hope
;
that
he
should
send
him
a
sanative
soporiferous
draught
,
and
would
see
him
in
the
morning
.
"
<EOS>
after
which
Barnabas
and
he
depart
,
and
leave
Mr
Joseph
and
Mr
Adams
together
.
  
<EOS>
Adams
inform
Joseph
of
the
occasion
of
this
journey
which
he
be
make
to
London
,
namely
,
to
publish
three
volume
of
sermon
;
be
encourage
,
as
he
say
,
by
an
advertisement
lately
set
forth
by
the
society
of
bookseller
,
who
propose
to
purchase
any
copy
offer
to
them
,
at
a
price
to
be
settle
by
two
person
;
but
though
he
imagine
he
should
get
a
considerable
sum
of
money
on
this
occasion
,
which
his
family
be
in
urgent
need
of
,
he
protest
he
would
not
leave
Joseph
in
his
present
condition
:
finally
,
he
tell
him
,
"
He
have
nine
shilling
and
threepence
halfpenny
in
his
pocket
,
which
he
be
welcome
to
use
as
he
please
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
goodness
of
parson
Adams
bring
tear
into
Joseph
's
eye
;
he
declare
,
"
He
have
now
a
second
reason
to
desire
life
,
that
he
may
show
his
gratitude
to
such
a
friend
.
"
<EOS>
Adams
bade
him
"
be
cheerful
;
for
that
he
plainly
see
the
surgeon
,
besides
his
ignorance
,
desire
to
make
a
merit
of
cure
him
,
though
the
wound
in
his
head
,
he
perceive
,
be
by
no
means
dangerous
;
that
he
be
convince
he
have
no
fever
,
and
doubt
<EOS>
not
<EOS>
but
he
would
be
able
to
travel
in
a
day
or
two
.
"
  
<EOS>
these
word
infuse
a
spirit
into
Joseph
;
he
say
,
"
He
find
himself
very
sore
from
the
bruise
,
but
have
no
reason
to
think
any
of
his
bone
injure
,
or
that
he
have
receive
any
harm
in
his
inside
,
unless
that
he
feel
something
very
odd
in
his
stomach
;
but
he
know
not
whether
that
may
not
arise
from
not
have
eat
one
morsel
for
above
twenty
-
four
hour
.
<EOS>
"
be
then
ask
if
he
have
any
inclination
to
eat
,
he
answer
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
then
parson
Adams
desire
him
to
"
name
what
he
have
the
great
fancy
for
;
whether
a
poached
egg
,
or
chicken
-
broth
.
"
<EOS>
He
answer
,
"
He
could
eat
both
very
well
;
but
that
he
seem
to
have
the
great
appetite
for
a
piece
of
boil
beef
and
cabbage
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adams
be
pleased
with
so
perfect
a
confirmation
that
he
have
not
the
least
fever
,
but
advise
him
to
a
light
diet
for
that
evening
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
eat
either
a
rabbit
or
a
fowl
,
I
never
could
with
any
tolerable
certainty
discover
which
;
after
this
he
be
,
by
Mrs
Tow
-
wouse
's
order
,
convey
into
a
well
bed
and
equip
with
one
of
her
husband
's
shirt
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
morning
early
,
Barnabas
and
the
surgeon
come
to
the
inn
,
in
order
to
see
the
thief
convey
before
the
justice
.
<EOS>
They
have
consume
the
whole
night
in
debate
what
measure
they
should
take
to
produce
the
piece
of
gold
in
evidence
against
him
;
for
they
be
both
extremely
zealous
in
the
business
,
though
neither
of
them
be
in
the
least
interested
in
the
prosecution
;
neither
of
them
have
ever
receive
any
private
injury
from
the
fellow
,
nor
have
either
of
them
ever
be
suspect
of
love
the
publick
well
enough
to
give
them
a
sermon
or
a
dose
of
physic
for
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
to
help
our
reader
,
therefore
,
as
much
as
possible
to
account
for
this
zeal
,
we
must
inform
him
that
,
as
this
parish
be
so
unfortunate
as
to
have
no
lawyer
in
it
,
there
have
be
a
constant
contention
between
the
two
doctor
,
spiritual
and
physical
,
concern
their
ability
in
a
science
,
in
which
,
as
neither
of
them
profess
it
,
they
have
equal
pretension
to
dispute
each
other
's
opinion
.
<EOS>
these
dispute
be
carry
on
with
great
contempt
on
both
side
,
and
have
almost
divide
the
parish
;
Mr
Tow
-
wouse
and
one
half
of
the
neighbour
incline
to
the
surgeon
,
and
Mrs
Tow
-
wouse
with
the
other
half
to
the
parson
.
<EOS>
the
surgeon
draw
his
knowledge
from
those
inestimable
fountain
,
call
the
Attorney
's
Pocket
Companion
,
and
Mr
Jacob
's
Law
-
Tables
;
Barnabas
trust
entirely
to
Wood
's
Institutes
.
<EOS>
It
happen
on
this
occasion
,
as
be
pretty
frequently
the
case
,
that
these
two
learn
man
differ
about
the
sufficiency
of
evidence
;
the
doctor
be
of
opinion
that
the
maid
's
oath
would
convict
the
prisoner
without
produce
the
gold
;
the
parson
,
e
contra
,
totis
viribus
.
<EOS>
to
display
their
part
,
therefore
,
before
the
justice
and
the
parish
,
be
the
sole
motive
which
we
can
discover
to
this
zeal
which
both
of
them
pretend
to
have
for
public
justice
.
  
<EOS>
o
vanity
!
<EOS>
how
little
be
thy
force
acknowledge
,
or
thy
operation
discern
!
<EOS>
how
wantonly
dost
thou
deceive
mankind
under
different
disguise
!
<EOS>
sometimes
thou
dost
wear
the
face
of
pity
,
sometimes
of
generosity
:
nay

<EOS>
thou
hast
the
assurance
even
to
put
on
those
glorious
ornament
which
belong
only
to
heroic
virtue

Thou
odious

deform
monster
!
<EOS>
whom
priest

be

yet

how

thee
in

<EOS>
nay

thou

the

the

be
daily
practise

the

thy

<EOS>
thy
embrace
be
often
the
sole
aim
and
sole
reward
of
the
private
robbery
and
the
plundered
province

<EOS>
It
be
to
pamper
up
thee
,
thou
harlot
,
that
we
attempt
to
withdraw
from

what
we

not

what

all

avarice

no

fly
before

<EOS>
I
know
thou
wilt
think
that
whilst
I
abuse
thee
I
court
thee
,
and
that
thy
love
hath
inspire
me
to
write
this
sarcastical
panegyric
on
thee
;
but
thou
art
deceive

I
value
thee
not

nor
will
it
give

any

prevail
on

this

arrant

I

<EOS>
the
escape
of
the
thief
.
<EOS>
Mr
Adams
's
disappointment
.
<EOS>
the
arrival
of
two
very
extraordinary
personage
,
and
the
introduction
of
parson
Adams
to
parson
Barnabas
.
  
<EOS>
Barnabas
and
the
surgeon
,
be
return
,
as
we
have
say
,
to
the
inn
,
in
order
to
convey
the
thief
before
the
justice
,
be
greatly
concerned
to
find
a
small
accident
have
happen
,
which
somewhat
disconcert
them
;
and
this
be
no
other
than
the
thief
's
escape
,
who
have
modestly
withdraw
himself
by
night
,
decline
all
ostentation
,
and
not
chuse
,
in
imitation
of
some
great
man
,
to
distinguish
himself
at
the
expense
of
be
point
at
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
company
have
retire
the
evening
before
,
the
thief
be
detain
in
a
room
where
the
constable
,
and
one
of
the
young
fellow
who
take
him
,
be
plant
as
his
guard
.
<EOS>
about
the
second
watch
a
general
complaint
of
drought
be
make
,
both
by
the
prisoner
and
his
keeper
.
<EOS>
among
whom
it
be
at
last
agree
that
the
constable
should
remain
on
duty
,
and
the
young
fellow
call
up
the
tapster
;
in
which
disposition
the
latter
apprehend
not
the
least
danger
,
as
the
constable
be
well
armed
,
and
could
besides
easily
summon
him
back
to
his
assistance
,
if
the
prisoner
make
the
least
attempt
to
gain
his
liberty
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
fellow
have
not
long
leave
the
room
before
it
come
into
the
constable
's
head
that
the
prisoner
may
leap
on
him
by
surprize
,
and
,
thereby
prevent
him
of
the
use
of
his
weapon
,
especially
the
long
staff
in
which
he
chiefly
confide
,
may
reduce
the
success
of
a
struggle
to
a
equal
chance
.
<EOS>
He
wisely
,
therefore
,
to
prevent
this
inconvenience
,
slipt
out
of
the
room
himself
,
and
lock
the
door
,
wait
without
with
his
staff
in
his
hand
,
ready
lift
to
fell
the
unhappy
prisoner
,
if
by
ill
fortune
he
should
attempt
to
break
out
.
  
<EOS>
but
human
life
,
as
hath
be
discover
by
some
great
man
or
other
(
for
I
would
by
no
means
be
understand
to
affect
the
honour
of
make
any
such
discovery
)
,
very
much
resemble
a
game
at
chess
;
for
as
in
the
latter
,
while
a
gamester
be
too
attentive
to
secure
himself
very
strongly
on
one
side
the
board
,
he
be
apt
to
leave
an
unguarded
opening
on
the
other
;
so
doth
it
often
happen
in
life
,
and
so
do
it
happen
on
this
occasion
;
for
whilst
the
cautious
constable
with
such
wonderful
sagacity
have
possess
himself
of
the
door
,
he
most
unhappily
forget
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
the
thief
,
who
play
on
the
other
side
,
no
sooner
perceive
this
opening
than
he
begin
to
move
that
way
;
and
,
find
the
passage
easy
<EOS>
,
he
take
with
him
the
young
fellow
's
hat
,
and
without
any
ceremony
step
into
the
street
and
make
the
good
of
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
fellow
,
return
with
a
double
mug
of
strong
beer
,
be
a
little
surprized
to
find
the
constable
at
the
door
;
but
much
more
so
<EOS>
when
,
the
door
be
open
,
he
perceive
the
prisoner
have
make
his
escape
,
and
which
way
.
<EOS>
He
throw
down
the
beer
,
and
,
without
utter
anything
to
the
constable
except
a
hearty
curse
or
two
,
he
nimbly
leapt
out
of
the
window
,
and
go
again
in
pursuit
of
his
prey
,
be
very
unwilling
to
lose
the
reward
which
he
have
assure
himself
of
.
  
<EOS>
the
constable
hath
not
be
discharge
of
suspicion
on
this
account
;
it
hath
be
say
that
,
not
be
concern
in
the
taking
the
thief
,
he
could
not
have
be
entitle
to
any
part
of
the
reward
if
he
have
be
convict
<EOS>
;
that
the
thief
have
several
guinea
in
his
pocket
;
that
it
be
very
unlikely
he
should
have
be
guilty
of
such
an
oversight
;
that
his
pretence
for
leave
the
room
be
absurd
;
that
it
be
his
constant
maxim
,
that
a
wise
man
never
refuse
money
on
any
condition
;
that
at
every
election
he
always
have
sell
his
vote
to
both
party
,
&
c.
  
<EOS>
but
,
notwithstanding
these
and
many
other
such
allegation
,
I
be
sufficiently
convinced
of
his
innocence
;
have
be
positively
assure
of
it
by
those
who
receive
their
information
from
his
own
mouth
;
which
,
in
the
opinion
of
some
modern
,
be
the
good
and
indeed
only
evidence
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
family
be
now
up
,
and
with
many
other
assemble
in
the
kitchen
,
where
Mr
Tow
-
wouse
be
in
some
tribulation
;
the
surgeon
have
declare
that
by
law
he
be
liable
to
be
indict
for
the
thief
's
escape
,
as
it
be
out
of
his
house
;
he
be
a
little
comfort
,
however
,
by
Mr
Barnabas
's
opinion
,
that
as
the
escape
be
by
night
the
indictment
would
not
lie
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Tow
-
wouse
deliver
herself
in
the
follow
word
:
"
sure
never
be
such
a
fool
as
my
husband
;
would
any
other
person
live
have
leave
a
man
in
the
custody
of
such
a
drunken
drowsy
blockhead
as
Tom
Suckbribe
?
"
<EOS>
(
which
be
the
constable
's
name
)
;
"
and
if
he
could
be
indict
without
any
harm
to
his
wife
and
child
,
I
should
be
glad
of
it
.

<EOS>
(
then
the
bell
ring
in
Joseph
's
room
.
)
<EOS>
"
why
Betty
,
John
,
Chamberlain
,
where
the
devil
be
you
all
?
<EOS>
have
you
no
ear
,
or
no
conscience

not
to
tend
the
sick

<EOS>
see
what
the
gentleman
want
.
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
go
yourself
,
Mr
Tow

wouse
?
<EOS>
but
any
one
may
die
for
you
;
you
have
no
more
feeling
than
a
deal
board
.
<EOS>
if
a
man
live
a
fortnight
in
your
house
without
spend
a
penny
,
you
would
never
put
him
in
mind
of
it

see
whether
he
drink
tea
or
coffee
for
breakfast
.
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
my
dear

cry
Tow
-
wouse
.
<EOS>
She
then
ask
the
doctor
and
Mr
Barnabas
<EOS>
what
morning
's
draught
they
choose
,
who
answer
,
they
have
a
pot
of
cyder
-
and
at
the
fire
;
which
we
will
leave
them
merry
over
,
and
return
to
Joseph
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
rise
pretty
early
this
morning
;
but
,
though
his
wound
be
far
from
threaten
any
danger
,
he
be
so
sore
with
the
bruise
,
that
it
be
impossible
for
him
to
think
of
undertake
a
journey
yet
;
<EOS>
Mr
Adams
,
therefore
,
whose
stock
be
visibly
decrease
with
the
expense
of
supper
and
breakfast
,
and
which
could
not
survive
that
day
's
scoring
,
begin
to
consider
how
it
be
possible
to
recruit
it
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
cry
,
"
He
have
luckily
hit
on
a
sure
method
,
and
,
though
it
would
oblige
him
to
return
himself
home
together
with
Joseph
,
it
matter
not
much
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
send
for
Tow

wouse
,
and
,
take
him
into
another
room
,
tell
him
"
he
want
to
borrow
three
guinea
,
for
which
he
would
put
ample
security
into
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tow
-
wouse
,
who
expect
a
watch
,
or
ring
,
or
something
of
double
the
value
,
answer
,
"
He
believe
he
could
furnish
him
.
"
<EOS>
upon
which
Adams
,
point
to
his
saddle

bag
,
tell
him
,
with
a
face
and
voice
full
of
solemnity
,
"
that
there
be
in
that
bag
no
less
than
nine
volume
of
manuscript
sermon
,
as
well
worth
a
hundred
pound
as
a
shilling
be
worth
twelve
penny
,
and
that
he
would
deposit
one
of
the
volume
in
his
hand
by
way
of
pledge
;
not
doubt
but
that
he
would
have
the
honesty
to
return
it
on
his
repayment
of
the
money
;
for
otherwise
he
must
be
a
very
great
loser
,
see
that
every
volume
would
at
least
bring
him
ten
pound
,
as
he
have
be
inform
by
a
neighbour
clergyman
in
the
country
;
for
,
"
say
he
,
"
as
to
my
own
part

have
never
yet
deal
in
printing
,
I
do
not
pretend
to
ascertain
the
exact
value
of
such
thing

"
  
<EOS>
Tow

wouse
,
who
be
a
little
surprize
at
the
pawn
,
say
(
and
not
without
some
truth
)
,
"
that
he
be
no
judge
of
the
price
of
such
kind
of
good
;
and
as
for
money
,
he
really
be
very
short
.
"
<EOS>
Adams
answer
,
"
certainly
he
would
not
scruple
to
lend
him
three
guinea
on
what
be
undoubtedly
worth
at
least
ten
.
"
<EOS>
the
landlord
reply
,
"
He
do
not
believe
he
have
so
much
money
in
the
house
,
and
besides
,
he
be
to
make
up
a
sum
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
confident
the
book
be
of
much
high
value
,
and
heartily
sorry
it
do
not
suit
him
.

<EOS>
He
then
cry
out
,
"
come
sir
!
"
<EOS>
though
nobody
call
;
and
run
downstairs
without
any
fear
of
break
his
neck
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Adams
be
extremely
dejected
at
this
disappointment
,
nor
know
he
what
further
stratagem
to
try
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
apply
to
his
pipe
,
his
constant
friend
and
comfort
in
his
affliction
;
and
,
lean
over
the
rail
,
he
devote
himself
to
meditation
,
assist
by
the
inspire
fume
of
tobacco
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
on
a
nightcap
draw
over
his
wig
,
and
a
short
greatcoat
,
which
half
cover
his
cassock
 
<EOS>
a
dress
which
,
add
to
something
comical
enough
in
his
countenance

compose
a
figure
likely
to
attract
the
eye
of
those
who
be
not

give

whilst

what
say
you

doctor

shall
we
adjourn
into
a
room
,

invite
him
to
take
part
of
a

of

<EOS>
this
proposal
be
immediately
agree
to
and
execute
;
and
parson
Adams
accept
the
invitation
,
much
civility
pass
between
the
two
clergyman
,
who
both
declare
the
great
honour
they
have
for
the
cloth
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
be
long
together
before
they
enter
into
a
discourse
on
small
tithe
,
which
continue
a
full
hour
,
without
the
doctor
or
exciseman
's
have
one
opportunity
to
offer
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
then
propose
to
begin
a
general
conversation
,
and
the
exciseman
open
on
foreign
affair
;
but
a
word
unluckily
drop
from
one
of
them
introduce
a
dissertation
on
the
hardship
suffer
by
the
inferior
clergy
;
which
,
after
a
long
duration
,
conclude
with
bring
the
nine
volume
of
sermon
on
the
carpet

<EOS>
Barnabas
greatly
discourage
poor
Adams
;
he
say
,
"
the
age
be
so
wicked
,
that
nobody
read
sermon
:
would
you
think
it
,
Mr
Adams
?
"
<EOS>
say
he
,
"
I
once
intend
to
print
a
volume
of
sermon
myself
,
and
they
have
the
approbation
of
two
or
three
bishop
;
but
what
do
you
think
a
bookseller
offer
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
twelve
guinea
perhaps
,
"
cry
Adams
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
twelve
penny
,
I
assure
you
,
"
answer
Barnabas
:
"
<EOS>
nay
,
the
dog
refuse
me
a
Concordance
in
exchange
.
<EOS>
at
last
I
offer
to
give
him
the
print
them
,
for
the
sake
of
dedicate
them
to
that
very
gentleman
who
just
now
drive
his
own
coach
into
the
inn
;
and
,
I
assure
you
,
he
have
the
impudence
to
refuse
my
offer
;
by
which
mean
I
lose
a
good
living
,
that
be
afterwards
give
away
in
exchange
for
a
pointer
,
to
one
who
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
say
anything
against
the
cloth
.
<EOS>
so
you
may
guess
,
Mr
Adams
,
what
you
be
to
expect
;
for
if
sermon
would
have
go
down
,
I
believe
 
I
will
not
be
vain
;
but
to
be
concise
with
you
,
three
bishop
say
they
be
the
good
that
ever
be
writ
:
<EOS>
but
indeed
there
be
a
pretty
moderate
number
print
already
,
and
not
all
sell
yet
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Pray
,
sir
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
to
what
do
you
think
the
number
may
amount
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
answer
Barnabas
,
"
a
bookseller
tell
me
,
he
believe
five
thousand
volume
at
least
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
five
thousand
?
"
<EOS>
quoth
the
surgeon
:
<EOS>
"
what
can
they
be
writ
upon
?
<EOS>
I
remember
when
I
be
a
boy
,
I
use
to
read
one
Tillotson
's
sermon
;
and
,
I
be
sure
,
if
a
man
practise
half
so
much
as
be
in
one
of
those
sermon
,
he
will
go
to
heaven
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
doctor
,
"
cry
Barnabas
,
"
you
have
a
prophane
way
of
talking
,
for
which
I
must
reprove
you
.
<EOS>
a
man
can
never
have
his
duty
too
frequently
inculcate
into
him
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
Tillotson
,
to
be
sure
he
be
a
good
writer
,
and
say
thing
very
well
;
but
comparison
be
odious
;
another
man
may
write
as
well
as
he
 
<EOS>
I
believe
there
be
some
of
my
sermon
,
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
apply
the
candle
to
his
pipe
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
I
believe
there
be
some
of
my
discourse
,
"
cry
Adams
,
"
which
the
bishop
would
not
think
totally
unworthy
of
be
print
;
and
<EOS>
I
have
be
inform
I
may
procure
a
very
large
sum
(
indeed
an
immense
one
)
on
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
that
,
"
answer
Barnabas
:
"
however
,
if
you
desire
to
make
some
money
of
them
,
perhaps
you
may
sell
them
by
advertise
the
manuscript
sermon
of
a
clergyman
lately
decease
,
all
warrant
original
,
and
never
print
.
<EOS>
and
now
I
think
of
it
,
I
should
be
oblige
to
you
,
if
there
be
ever
a
funeral
one
among
them
,
to
lend
it
me
;
for
I
be
this
very
day
to
preach
a
funeral
sermon
,
for
which
I
have
not
pen
a
line
,
though
I
be
to
have
a
double
price
.
"
 
<EOS>
Adams
answer
,
"
He
have
but
one
,
which
he
fear
would
not
serve
his
purpose
,
be
sacred
to
the
memory
of
a
magistrate
,
who
have
exert
himself
very
singularly
in
the
preservation
of
the
morality
of
his
neighbour
,
insomuch
that
he
have
neither
alehouse
nor
lewd
woman
in
the
parish
where
he
live
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
reply
Barnabas
,
"
that
will
not
do
quite
so
well
;
for
the
deceased
,
upon
whose
virtue
I
be
to
harangue
,
be
a
little
too
much
addict
to
liquor
,
and
publickly
keep
a
mistress
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
must
take
a
common
sermon
,
and
trust
to
my
memory
to
introduce
something
handsome
on
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
to
your
invention
rather
,
"
say
the
doctor
:
"
your
memory
will
be
apter
to
put
you
out
;
for
no
man
live
remember
anything
good
of
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
such
kind
of
spiritual
discourse
,
they
empty
the
bowl
of
punch
,
pay
their
reckoning
,
and
separate
:
<EOS>
Adams
and
the
doctor
go
up
to
Joseph
,
parson
Barnabas
depart
to
celebrate
the
aforesaid
deceased
,
and
the
exciseman
descend
into
the
cellar
to
gauge
the
vessel
.
  
<EOS>
Joseph
be
now
ready
to
sit
down
to
a
loin
of
mutton
,
and
wait
for
Mr
Adams
,
when
he
and
the
doctor
come
in
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
have
feel
his
pulse
and
examine
his
wound
,
declare
him
much
better
,
which
he
impute
to
that
sanative
soporiferous
draught
,
a
medicine
"
whose
virtue
,
"
he
say
,
"
be
never
to
be
sufficiently
extoll
.
"
<EOS>
and
great
indeed
they
must
be
,
if
Joseph
be
so
much
indebted
to
them
as
the
doctor
imagine
;
since
nothing
more
than
those
effluvium
which
escape
the
cork
could
have
contribute
to
his
recovery
;
for
the
medicine
have
stand
untouched
in
the
window
ever
since
its
arrival
.
  
<EOS>
Joseph
pass
that
day
,
and
the
three
following
,
with
his
friend
Adams
,
in
which
nothing
so
remarkable
happen
as
the
swift
progress
of
his
recovery
.
<EOS>
as
he
have
an
excellent
habit
of
body
,
his
wound
be
now
almost
heal
;
and
his
bruise
give
him
so
little
uneasiness
,
that
he
press
Mr
Adams
to
let
him
depart
;
tell
him
he
should
never
be
able
to
return
sufficient
thank
for
all
his
favour
,
but
beg
that
he
may
no
longer
delay
his
journey
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
Adams
,
notwithstanding
the
ignorance
,
as
he
conceive
it
,
of
Mr
Tow
-
wouse
,
and
the
envy
(
for
such
<EOS>
he
think
it
)
of
Mr
Barnabas
,
have
great
expectation
from
his
sermon
:
see
therefore
Joseph
in
so
good
a
way
,
he
tell
him
he
would
agree
to
his
setting
out
the
next
morning
in
the
stage
-
coach
,
that
he
believe
he
should
have
sufficient
,
after
the
reckoning
pay
,
to
procure
him
one
day
's
conveyance
in
it
,
and
afterwards
he
would
be
able
to
get
on
on
foot
,
or
may
be
favour
with
a
lift
in
some
neighbour
's
waggon
,
especially
as
there
be
then
to
be
a
fair
in
the
town
whither
<EOS>
the
coach
would
carry
him
,
to
which
number
from
his
parish
resort
 
<EOS>
and
as
to
himself
,
he
agree
to
proceed
to
the
great
city
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
now
walk
in
the
inn
-
yard
,
when
a
fat
,
fair
,
short
person
ride
in
,
and
,
alight
from
his
horse
,
go
directly
up
to
Barnabas
,
who
be
smoake
his
pipe
on
a
bench
.
<EOS>
the
parson
and
the
stranger
shake
one
another
very
lovingly
by
the
hand
,
and
go
into
a
room
together
.
  
<EOS>
the
evening
now
come
on
,
Joseph
retire
to
his
chamber
,
whither
the
good
Adams
accompany
him
,
and
take
this
opportunity
to
expatiate
on
the
great
mercy
God
have
lately
show
him
,
of
which
he
ought
not
only
to
have
the
deep
inward
sense
,
but
likewise
to
express
outward
thankfulness
for
them
.
<EOS>
They
therefore
fall
both
on
their
knee
,
and
spend
a
considerable
time
in
prayer
and
thanksgiving
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
just
finish
when
Betty
come
in
and
tell
Mr
Adams
Mr
Barnabas
desire
to
speak
to
him
on
some
business
of
consequence
below
-
stair
.
<EOS>
Joseph
desire
,
if
it
be
likely
to
detain
him
long
,
he
would
let
him
know
it
,
that
he
may
go
to
bed
,
which
Adams
promise
,
and
in
that
case
they
wish
one
another
good

night

<EOS>
a
pleasant
discourse
between
the
two
parson
and
the
bookseller
,
"
which
be
break
off
by
an
unlucky
accident
happen
in
the
inn
,
which
produce
a
dialogue
between
Mrs
Tow
-
wouse
and
her
maid
of
no
gentle
kind
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Adams
come
into
the
room
,
Mr
Barnabas
introduce
him
to
the
stranger
,
who
be
,
he
tell
him
,
a
bookseller
,
and
would
be
as
likely
to
deal
with
him
for
his
sermon
as
any
man
whatever
.
<EOS>
Adams
,
salute
the
stranger
,
answer
Barnabas
,
that
he
be
very
much
oblige
to
him
;
that
nothing
could
be
more
convenient
,
for
he
have
no
other
business
to
the
great
city
,
and
be
heartily
desirous
of
return
with
the
young
man
,
who
be
just
recover
of
his
misfortune
.
<EOS>
He
then
snapt
his
finger
(
as
be
usual
with
him
)
,
and
take
two
or
three
turn
about
the
room
in
an
extasy
.
<EOS>
and
to
induce
the
bookseller
to
be
as
expeditious
as
possible
,
as
likewise
to
offer
him
a
well
price
for
his
commodity
,
he
assure
them
their
meeting
be
extremely
lucky
to
himself
;
for
that
he
have
the
most
pressing
occasion
for
money
at
that
time
,
his
own
being
almost
spend
,
and
have
a
friend
then
in
the
same
inn
,
who
be
just
recover
from
some
wound
he
have
receive
from
robber
,
and
be
in
a
most
indigent
condition
.
"
<EOS>
so
that
nothing
,
"
say
he
,
"
could
be
so
opportune
for
the
supply
both
our
necessity
as
my
make
an
immediate
bargain
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
have
seat
himself
,
the
stranger
begin
in
these
word
:
"
Sir
,
I
do
not
care
absolutely
to
deny
engage
in
what
my
friend
Mr
Barnabas
recommend
;
but
sermon
be
mere
drug
.
<EOS>
the
trade
be
so
vastly
stock
with
them
,
that
really
,
unless
they
come
out
with
the
name
of
Whitefield
or
Wesley
,
or
some
other
such
great
man
,
as
a
bishop
,
or
those
sort
of
people
,
I
do
not
care
to
touch
;
unless
now
it
be
a
sermon
preach
on
the
30th
of
January
;
or
we
could
say
in
the
title
-
page
,
publish
at
the
earnest
request
of
the
congregation
,
or
the
inhabitant
;
but
,
truly
,
for
a
dry
piece
of
sermon
,
I
have
rather
be
excuse
;
especially
as
my
hand
be
so
full
at
present
.
<EOS>
however
,
sir
,
as
Mr
Barnabas
mention
them
to
me
,
I
will
,
if
you
please
,
take
the
manuscript
with
me
to
town
,
and
send
you
my
opinion
of
it
in
a
very
short
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
"
say
Adams
,
"
if
you
desire
it
,
I
will
read
two
or
three
discourse
as
a
speciman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
Barnabas
,
who
love
sermon
no
well
than
a
grocer
doth
fig
,
immediately
object
to
,
and
advise
Adams
to
let
the
bookseller
have
his
sermon
:
tell
him
,
"
if
he
give
him
a
direction
,
he
may
be
certain
of
a
speedy
answer
;
"
add
,
he
nee
not
scruple
trust
them
in
his
possession
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
"
say
the
bookseller
,
"
if
it
be
a
play
that
have
be
act
twenty
night
together
,
I
believe
it
would
be
safe
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adams
do
not
at
all
relish
the
last
expression
;
he
say
"
he
be
sorry
to
hear
sermon
compare
to
play
.
"
<EOS>
"
not
by
me
,
I
assure
you
,
"
cry
the
bookseller
,
"
though
I
do
not
know
whether
the
licensing
act
may
not
shortly
bring
them
to
the
same
footing
;
but
I
have
formerly
know
a
hundred
guinea
give
for
a
play
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
More
shame
for
those
who
give
it
,
"
cry
Barnabas
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
so
?
"
say
the
bookseller
,
"
for
they
get
hundred
by
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
be
there
no
difference
between
convey
good
or
ill
instruction
to
mankind
?
"
say
Adams
:
"
Would
not
an
honest
mind
rather
lose
money
by
the
one
,
than
gain
it
by
the
other
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
can
find
any
such
,
I
will
not
be
their
hindrance
,
"
answer
the
bookseller
;
"
but

think
those
person
who

be
the
proper

lose
by
print
them

for
my
part
,
the
copy
that
sell
best
will
be
always
the
good
copy
in
my
opinion
;
I
be
no
enemy
to
sermon
,
but
because
they
do
not
sell
:
for
I
would
as
soon
print
one
of
Whitefield

as
any
farce
whatever
.

Sir

this
fellow

(
I
know
not
whether

be
level
at
the
clergy
.
<EOS>
He
would
reduce
us
to
the
example
of
the
primitive
age
,
forsooth
!
<EOS>
and
would
insinuate
to
the
people
that
a
clergyman
ought
to
be
always
preach
and
pray
.
<EOS>
He
pretend
to
understand
the
scripture
literally
;
and
would
make
mankind
believe
that
the
poverty
and
low
estate
which
be
recommend
to
the
Church
in
its
infancy
,
and
be
only
temporary
doctrine
adapt
to
her
under
persecution
,
be
to
be
preserve
in
her
flourishing
and
established
state
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
the
principle
of
Toland
,
Woolston
,
and
all
the
freethinker
,
be
not
calculate
to
do
half
the
mischief
,
as
those
profess
by
this
fellow
and
his
follower
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
answer
Adams
,
"
if
Mr
Whitefield
have
carry
his
doctrine
no
farther
than
you
mention
,
I
should
have
remain
,
as
I
once
be
,
his
well
-
wisher

<EOS>
I
be
,
myself
,
as
great
an
enemy
to
the
luxury
and
splendour
of
the
clergy
as
he
can
be
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
,
more
than
he
,
by
the
flourish
estate
of
the
Church
,
understand
the
palace
,
equipage
,
dress
,
furniture
,
rich
dainty
,
and
vast
fortune
,
of
her
minister
.
<EOS>
surely
those
thing
,
which
savour
so
strongly
of
this
world
,
become
not
the
servant
of
one
who
profess
His
kingdom
be
not
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
begin
to
call
nonsense
and
enthusiasm
to
his
aid
,
and
set
up
the
detestable
doctrine
of
faith
against
good
work
,
I
be
his
friend
no
longer
;
for
surely
that
doctrine
be
coin
in
hell
;
and
one
would
think
none
but
the
devil
himself
could
have
the
confidence
to
preach
it
.
<EOS>
for
can
anything
be
more
derogatory
to
the
honour
of
God
than
for
man
to
imagine
that
the
all
-
wise
being
will
hereafter
say
to
the
good
and
virtuous
,
"
notwithstanding
the
purity
of
thy
life
,
notwithstanding
that
constant
rule
of
virtue

goodness
in
which
you
walk
upon

,
still
,
as
thou
didst
not
believe
everything
in
the
true
orthodox
manner

thy
want
of
faith
shall
condemn
thee
?
"
<EOS>
or
,
on
the
other
side
,
can
any
doctrine
have
a
more
pernicious
influence
on
society
,
than
a
persuasion
that
it
will
be
a
good
plea
for
the
villain
at
the
last
day

"
Lord

it

I

<EOS>

I

the

your

"
 
<EOS>
"
Aye

sir

"
say
Adams
;
"
the
contrary
,
I
thank
Heaven
,
be
inculcate
in
almost
every
page

or
I
should
belye
my

opinion
,
which
hath
always
be
,
that
a
virtuous
and
good
Turk
,
or
heathen
,
be
more
acceptable
in
the
sight
of
their
Creator
than
a
vicious

wicked
Christian

his

perfectly
orthodox

St

himself

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
success

the

"
but
must
beg
to
be
excuse
,
as
my
hand
be
so
very
full

and
,
indeed
,
I
be
afraid
you
will
find
a
backwardness
in
the

to
engage
in

the

"
 
<EOS>
"
God
forbid

any

factious

it

a

him
with
great

<EOS>
Joseph
,
in
great

leapt
from

tell
her
he
be
sorry

see
a

cast
off
all
regard
to
modesty

but
she
have
go
too
far
to
recede
,
and
grow
so
very
indecent
,
that
Joseph
be
oblige
,
contrary
to
his
inclination
,
to
use
some
violence
to
her

and

take

he

how
ought
man
to
rejoice
that
his
chastity
be
always
in
his
own
power

that
,
if
he
hath
sufficient
strength
of
mind
,
he
hath
always
a
competent
strength
of
body
to
defend
himself

can
not

like
a
poor
weak
woman

be
ravish

his

<EOS>
Betty
be
in
the
most
violent
agitation
at
this
disappointment
.
<EOS>
rage
and
lust
pull
her
heart
,
as
with
two
string
,
two
different
way
;
one
moment
she
think
of
stab
Joseph
;
the
next
,
of
take
him
in
her
arm
,
and
devour
him
with
kiss
;
but
the
latter
passion
be
far
more
prevalent
.
<EOS>
then
she
think
of
revenge
his
refusal
on
herself
;
but
,
whilst
she
be
engage
in
this
meditation
,
happily
death
present
himself
to
her
in
so
many
shape
,
of
drown
,
hang
,
poisoning
,
&
c.
,
that
her
distracted
mind
could
resolve
on
none

<EOS>
in
this
perturbation
of
spirit
,
it
accidentally
occur
to
her
memory
that
her
master
's
bed
be
not
make
;
she
therefore
go
directly
to
his
room
,
where
he
happen
at
that
time
to
be
engage
at
his
bureau
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
see
him
,
she
attempt
to
retire
;
but
he
call
her
back
,
and
,
take
her
by
the
hand
,
squeeze
her
so
tenderly
,
at
the
same
time
whisper
so
many
soft
thing
into
her
ear
,
and
then
press
her
so
closely
with
his
kiss
,
that
the
vanquish
fair
one
,
whose
passion
be
already
raise
,
and
which
be
not
so
whimsically
capricious
that
one
man
only
could
lay
them
,
though
,
perhaps
,
she
would
have
rather
prefer
that
one
 
<EOS>
the
vanquish
fair
one
quietly
submit
,
I
say
,
to
her
master
's
will
,
who
have
just
attain
the
accomplishment
of
his
bliss
when
Mrs
Tow

wouse
unexpectedly
enter
the
room

and
cause
all
that
confusion
which
we
have
before
see

and
which
it
be
not

at

,
to
take
any

notice
of
;
<EOS>
since
,
without
the
assistance
of
a
single
hint
from
us
,
every
reader
of
any
speculation
or
experience
,
though
not
marry
himself
,
may
easily
conjecture
that
it
conclude
with
the
discharge
of
Betty
,
the
submission
of
Mr
Tow
-
wouse
,
with
some
thing
to
be
perform
on
his
side
by
way
of
gratitude
for

to

with
many
hearty

never

manner

and

,
his
quietly
and
contentedly
bear

be
remind

BOOK
II
.
  
<EOS>
.
  
<EOS>
of
Divisions
in
author
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
certain
mystery
or
secret
in
all
trade
,
from
the
high
to
the
low
,
from
that
of
prime
-
ministering
to
this
of
authoring
,
which
be
seldom
discover
unless
to
member
of
the
same
calling
.
<EOS>
among
those
use
by
us
gentleman
of
the
latter
occupation
,
I
take
this
of
divide
our
work
into
book
and
chapter
to
be
none
of
the
least
considerable
.
<EOS>
now
,
for
want
of
be
truly
acquaint
with
this
secret
,
common
reader
imagine
,
that
by
this
art
of
divide
we
mean
only
to
swell
our
work
to
a
much
large
bulk
than
they
would
otherwise
be
extend
to
.
<EOS>
these
several
place
therefore
in
our
paper
,
which
be
fill
with
our
book
and
chapter
,
be
understand
as
so
much
buckram
,
stay
,
and
stay
-
tape
in
a
taylor
's
bill
,
serve
only
to
make
up
the
sum
total
,
commonly
find
at
the
bottom
of
our
first
page
and
of
his
last
.
  
<EOS>
but
in
reality
the
case
be
otherwise
,
and
in
this
as
well
as
all
other
instance
we
consult
the
advantage
of
our
reader
,
not
our
own
;
and
indeed
,
many
notable
use
arise
to
him
from
this
method
;
for
,
first
,
those
little
space
between
our
chapter
may
be
look
upon
as
an
inn
or
resting
-
place
where
he
may
stop
and
take
a
glass
or
any
other
refreshment
as
it
please
him
.
<EOS>
nay
,
our
fine
reader
will
,
perhaps
,
be
scarce
able
to
travel
farther
than
through
one
of
them
in
a
day
.
<EOS>
as
to
those
vacant
page
which
be
place
between
our
book
,
they
be
to
be
regard
as
those
stage
where
in
long
journie
the
traveller
stay
some
time
to
repose
himself
,
and
consider
of
what
he
hath
see
in
the
part
he
hath
already
pass
through
;
a
consideration
which
I
take
the
liberty
to
recommend
a
little
to
the
reader
;
for
,
however
swift
his
capacity
may
be
,
I
would
not
advise
him
to
travel
through
these
page
too
fast
;
for
if
he
doth
,
he
may
probably
miss
the
see
some
curious
production
of
nature
,
which
will
be
observe
by
the
slow
and
more
accurate
reader
.
<EOS>
a
volume
without
any
such
place
of
rest
resemble
the
opening
of
wild
or
sea
,
which
tire
the
eye
and
fatigue
the
spirit
when
enter
upon
.
  
<EOS>
secondly
,
what
be
the
content
prefix
to
every
chapter
but
<EOS>
so
many
inscription
over
the
gate
of
inn
(
to
continue
the
same
metaphor
)
,
inform
the
reader
what
entertainment
he
be
to
expect
,
<EOS>
which
if
he
like
not
,
he
may
travel
on
to
the
next
;
for
,
in
biography
,
as
we
be
not
tie
down
to
an
exact
concatenation
equally
with
other
historian
,
so
a
chapter
or
two
(
for
instance
,
this
I
be
now
write
)
may
be
often
pass
over
without
any
injury
to
the
whole
.
<EOS>
and
in
these
inscription
I
have
be
as
faithful
as
possible
,
not
imitate
the
celebrated
Montaigne
,
who
promise
you
one
thing
and
give
you
another
;
nor
some
title
-
page
author
,
who
promise
a
great
deal
and
produce
nothing
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
,
besides
these
more
obvious
benefit
,
several
other
which
our
reader
enjoy
from
this
art
of
divide
;
though
perhaps
most
of
them
too
mysterious
to
be
presently
understand
by
any
who
be
not
initiate
into
the
science
of
author
.
<EOS>
to
mention
,
therefore
,
but
one
which
be
most
obvious
,
it
prevent
spoil
the
beauty
of
a
book
by
turn
down
its
leave
,
a
method
otherwise
necessary
to
those
reader
who
(
though
they
read
with
great
improvement
and
advantage
)
be
apt
,
when
they
return
to
their
study
after
half
-
an
-
hour
's
absence
,
to
forget
where
they
leave
off
.
  
<EOS>
these
division
have
the
sanction
of
great
antiquity
.
<EOS>
homer
not
only
divide
his
great
work
into
twenty
-
four
book
(
in
compliment
perhaps
to
the
twenty
-
four
letter
to
which
he
have
very
particular
obligation
)
,
but
,
accord
to
the
opinion
of
some
very
sagacious
critic
,
hawk
them
all
separately
,
deliver
only
one
book
at
a
time
(
probably
by
subscription
)
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
first
inventor
of
the
art
which
hath
so
long
lain
dormant
,
of
publish
by
number
;
an
art
now
bring
to
such
perfection
,
that
even
dictionary
be
divide
and
exhibit
piecemeal
to
the
public
;
nay
,
one
bookseller
hath
(
to
encourage
learning
and
ease
the
public
)
contrive
to
give
them
a
dictionary
in
this
divide
manner
for
only
fifteen
shilling
more
than
it
would
have
cost
entire
.
  
<EOS>
Virgil
hath
give
us
his
poem
in
twelve
book
,
an
argument
of
his
modesty
;
for
by
that
,
doubtless
,
he
would
insinuate
that
he
pretend
to
no
more
than
half
the
merit
of
the
Greek
;
for
the
same
reason
,
our
Milton
go
originally
no
farth
than
ten
;
till
,
be
puff
up
by
the
praise
of
his
friend
,
he
put
himself
on
the
same
footing
with
the
roman
poet
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
not
,
however
,
enter
so
deep
into
this
matter
as
some
very
learn
critick
have
do
;
who
have
with
infinite
labour
and
acute
discernment
discover
what
book
be
proper
for
embellishment
,
and
what
require
simplicity
only
,
particularly
with
regard
to
simile
,
which
I
think
be
now
generally
agree
to
become
any
book
but
the
first
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
dismiss
this
chapter
with
the
follow
observation
:
that
it
become
an
author
generally
to
divide
a
book
,
as
it
do
a
butcher
to
joint
his
meat
,
for
such
assistance
be
of
great
help
to
both
the
reader
and
the
carver
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
have
indulge
myself
a
little
,
I
will
endeavour
to
indulge
the
curiosity
of
my
reader
,
who
be
no
doubt
impatient
to
know
what
he
will
find
in
the
subsequent
chapter
of
this
book
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
a
surprizing
instance
of
Mr
Adams
's
short
memory
,
with
the
unfortunate
consequence
which
it
bring
on
Joseph
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Adams
and
Joseph
be
now
ready
to
depart
different
way
,
when
an
accident
determine
the
former
to
return
with
his
friend
,
which
Tow
-
wouse
,
Barnabas
,
and
the
bookseller
have
not
be
able
to
do
.
<EOS>
this
accident
be
,
that
those
sermon
,
which
the
parson
be
travel
to
London
to
publish
,
be
,
o
my
good
reader
!
<EOS>
leave
behind
;
what
he
have
mistake
for
them
in
the
saddlebag
be
no
other
than
three
shirt
,
a
pair
of
shoe
,
and
some
other
necessary
,
which
Mrs
Adams
,
who
think
her
husband
would
want
shirt
more
than
sermon
on
his
journey
,
have
carefully
provide
him
.
  
<EOS>
this
discovery
be
now
luckily
owe
to
the
presence
of
Joseph
at
the
opening
the
saddlebag
;
who
,
have
hear
his
friend
say
he
carry
with
him
nine
volume
of
sermon
,
and
not
be
of
that
sect
of
philosopher
who
can
reduce
all
the
matter
of
the
world
into
a
nutshell
,
see
there
be
no
room
for
them
in
the
bag
,
where
the
parson
have
say
they
be
deposit
,
have
the
curiosity
to
cry
out
<EOS>
,
"
bless
me
,
sir
,
where
be
your
sermon
?
<EOS>
"
the
parson
answer
,
"
there
,
there
,
child
;
there
they
be
,
under
my
shirt
.
"
now
it
happen
that
he
have
take
forth
his
last
shirt
,
and
the
vehicle
remain
visibly
empty
.
"
<EOS>
sure
,
sir
,
"
say
Joseph
,
"
there
be
nothing
in
the
bag
.
<EOS>
"
upon
which
Adams
,
start
,
and
testify
some
surprize
,
cry
,
"
hey
!
fie
,
fie
upon
it
!
<EOS>
they
be
not
here
sure
enough
.
<EOS>
ay
,
they
be
certainly
leave
behind
.
"
  
<EOS>
Joseph
be
greatly
concerned
at
the
uneasiness
which
he
apprehend
his
friend
must
feel
from
this
disappointment
;
he
beg
him
to
pursue
his
journey
,
and
promise
he
would
himself
return
with
the
book
to
him
with
the
utmost
expedition
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
thank
you
,
child
,
"
answer
Adams
;
"
it
shall
not
be
so
.
<EOS>
what
would
it
avail
me
,
to
tarry
in
the
great
city
,
unless
I
have
my
discourse
with
me
,
which
be
ut
ita
dicam
,
the
sole
cause
,
the
aitia
monotate
of
my
peregrination
?
<EOS>
no
,
child
,
as
this
accident
hath
happen
,
I
be
resolve
to
return
back
to
my
cure
,
together
with
you
;
which
indeed
my
inclination
sufficiently
lead
me
to
.
<EOS>
this
disappointment
may
perhaps
be
intend
for
my
good
.
"
<EOS>
He
conclude
with
a
verse
out
of
Theocritus
,
which
signify
no
more
than
that
<EOS>
sometimes
it
rain
,
and
sometimes
the
sun
shine
.
  
<EOS>
Joseph
bow
with
obedience
and
thankfulness
for
the
inclination
which
the
parson
express
of
return
with
him
;
and
now
the
bill
be
call
for
,
which
,
on
examination
,
amount
within
a
shilling
to
the
sum
Mr
Adams
have
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
reader
may
wonder
how
he
be
able
to
produce
a
sufficient
sum
for
so
many
day
:
that
he
may
not
be
surprize
,
therefore
,
it
can
not
be
unnecessary
to
acquaint
him
that
he
have
borrow
a
guinea
of
a
servant
belong
to
the
coach
and
six
,
who
have
be
formerly
one
of
his
parishioner
,
and
whose
master
,
the
owner
of
the
coach
,
then
live
within
three
mile
of
him
;
for
so
good
be
the
credit
of
Mr
Adams
,
that
even
Mr
Peter
,
the
Lady
Booby
's
steward
,
would
have
lend
him
a
guinea
with
very
little
security
.
  
<EOS>
[
illustration
]
  
<EOS>
Mr
Adams
discharge
the
bill
,
and
they
be
both
set
out
,
have
agree
to
ride
and
tie
;
a
method
of
travel
much
use
by
person
who
have
but
one
horse
between
them
,
and
be
thus
perform
.
<EOS>
the
two
traveller
set
out
together
,
one
on
horseback
,
the
other
on
foot
:
now
,
as
it
generally
happen
that
he
on
horseback
outgo
him
on
foot
,
the
custom
be
,
that
,
when
he
arrive
at
the
distance
agree
on
,
he
be
to
dismount
,
tie
the
horse
to
some
gate
,
tree
,
post
,
or
other
thing
,
and
then
proceed
on
foot
;
when
the
other
come
up
to
the
horse
he
untie
him
,
mount
,
and
gallop
on
,
till
,
have
pass
by
his
fellow
-
traveller
,
he
likewise
arrive
at
the
place
of
tie
.
<EOS>
and
this
be
that
method
of
travel
so
much
in
use
among
our
prudent
ancestor
,
who
know
that
horse
have
mouth
as
well
as
leg
,
and
that
they
could
not
use
the
latter
without
be
at
the
expense
of
suffer
the
beast
themselves
to
use
the
former
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
method
in
use
in
those
day
when
,
instead
of
a
coach
and
six
,
a
member
of
parliament
's
lady
use
to
mount
a
pillion
behind
her
husband
;
and
a
grave
serjeant
at
law
condescend
to
amble
to
Westminster
on
an
easy
pad
,
with
his
clerk
kick
his
heel
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
Adams
be
now
go
some
minute
,
have
insist
on
Joseph
's
<EOS>
begin
the
journey
on
horseback
,
and
Joseph
have
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
,
when
the
hostler
present
him
a
bill
for
the
horse
's
board
during
his
residence
at
the
inn
.
<EOS>
Joseph
say
Mr
Adams
have
pay
all
;
but
this
matter
,
be
refer
to
Mr
Tow
-
wouse
,
be
by
him
decide
in
favour
of
the
hostler
,
and
indeed
with
truth
and
justice
;
for
this
be
a
fresh
instance
of
that
shortness
of
memory
which
do
not
arise
from
want
of
part
,
but
that
continual
hurry
in
which
parson
Adams
be
always
involve
.
  
<EOS>
Joseph
be
now
reduce
to
a
dilemma
which
extremely
puzzle
him
.
<EOS>
the
sum
due
for
horse
-
meat
be
twelve

there
have
be
some
ingenious
person
who
have
contrive
to
pay
twelve
shilling

Joseph
be
not
one
of
them

<EOS>
He
have
never
contract
a
debt
in
his
life
,
and
be
consequently
the
less
ready
at
an
expedient
to
extricate
himself

<EOS>
Tow

wouse
be
willing
to
give
him
credit
till
next
time
,
to
which
Mrs
Tow

wouse
would
probably
have
consent
(
for
such
be
Joseph

beauty
,
that
it
have
make
some
impression
even
on
that
piece
of
flint
which
that
good

<EOS>
Joseph
would
have
find
,
therefore
,
very
likely
the
passage
free
,
have
he
not
,
when
he
honestly
discover
the
nakedness
of
his
pocket
,
pull
out
that
little
piece

mention
before

<EOS>
this

she
tell
Joseph
she
do
not
conceive
a

could
want
money

in

<EOS>
Joseph
answer
he
have
such
a
value
for
that
little
piece
of
gold
,
that
he
would
not
part
with
it
for
a
hundred
time
the
rich
which
the
great
esquire
in
the
county
be
worth

"
<EOS>
a
pretty
way
,
indeed
,
"
say
Mrs
Tow
-
wouse
,
"
to
run
in
debt
,
and
then
refuse
to
part
with
your
money
,
because
you
have
a
value
for
it
!
<EOS>
I
never
know
any
piece
of
gold
of
more
value
than
as
many
shilling
as
it
would
change
for
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
to
preserve
my
life
from
starve
,
nor
to
redeem
it
from
a
robber
,
would
I
part
with
this
dear
piece
!
"
answer
Joseph
.
<EOS>
"
what
,
"
say
Mrs
Tow
-
wouse
,
"
I
suppose
it
be
give
you
by
some
vile
trollop

some
miss

other

you

such
a

<EOS>
My

be
a
fool
if
he
part
with

without

"
 
<EOS>
"
no

no
,
I
can
not
part
with
the

indeed
,
till
I
have
the

"
cry
Tow

wouse
.
<EOS>
a
resolution
highly
commend
by
a
lawyer
then
in
the
yard
,
who
declare
Mr
Tow
-
wouse
may
justify
the
detainer
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
can
not
therefore
at
present
get
Mr
Joseph
out
of
the
inn
,
we
shall
leave
him
in
it
,
and
carry
our
reader
on
after
parson
Adams
,
who
,
his
mind
be
perfectly
at
ease
,
fall
into
a
contemplation
on
a
passage
in
Aeschylus
,
which
entertain
him
for
three
mile
together
,
without
suffer
him
once
to
reflect
on
his
fellow
-
traveller
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
,
have
spin
out
his
thread
,
and
be
now
at
the
summit
of
a
hill
,
he
cast
his
eye
backwards
,
and
wonder
that
he
could
not
see
any
sign
of
Joseph
.
<EOS>
as
he
leave
him
ready
to
mount
the
horse
,
he
could
not
apprehend
any
mischief
have
happen
,
neither
could
he
suspect
that
he
miss
his
way
,
it
be
so
broad
and
plain
;
the
only
reason
which
present
itself
to
him
be
,
that
he
have
meet
with
an
acquaintance
who
have
prevail
with
him
to
delay
some
time
in
discourse
.
  
<EOS>
He
therefore
resolve
to
proceed
slowly
forwards
,
not
doubt
but
that
he
should
be
shortly
overtake
;
and
soon
come
to
a
large
water
,
which
,
fill
the
whole
road
,
he
see
no
method
of
pass
unless
by
wade
through
,
which
he
accordingly
do
up
to
his
middle
;
but
be
no
sooner
get
to
the
other
side
than
he
perceive
,
if
he
have
look
over
the
hedge
,
he
would
have
find
a
footpath
capable
of
conduct
him
without
wet
his
shoe
.
  
<EOS>
His
surprize
at
Joseph
's
not
come
up
grow
now
very
troublesome
<EOS>
:
he
begin
to
fear
he
know
not
what
;
and
as
he
determine
to
move
no
farther
,
and
,
if
he
do
not
shortly
overtake
him
,
to
return
back
,
he
wish
to
find
a
house
of
public
entertainment
where
he
may
dry
his
clothe
and
refresh
himself
with
a
pint
;
but
,
see
no
such
(
for
no
other
reason
than
because
he
do
not
cast
his
eye
a
hundred
yard
forwards
)
,
he
sit
himself
down
on
a
stile
,
and
pull
out
his
Aeschylus
.
  
<EOS>
a
fellow
passing
presently
by
<EOS>
,
Adams
ask
him
if
he
could
direct
him
to
an
alehouse
.
<EOS>
the
fellow
,
who
have
just
leave
it
,
and
perceive
the
house
and
sign
to
be
within
sight
,
think
he
have
jeer
him
,
and
be
of
a
morose
temper
,
bade
him
follow
his
nose
and
be
d####n'd
.
<EOS>
Adams
tell
him
he
be
a
saucy
jackanape
;
upon
which
the
fellow
turn
about
angrily
;
but
,
perceive
Adams
clench
his
fist
,
he
think
proper
to
go
on
without
take
any
farth
notice
.
  
<EOS>
a
horseman
,
follow
immediately
after
,
and
be
ask
the
same
question
,
answer
,
"
friend
,
there
be
one
within
a
stone
's
throw
;
I
believe
you
may
see
it
before
you
.
"
<EOS>
Adams
,
lift
up
his
eye
,
cry
,
"
I
protest
,
and
so
there
be
;
"
and
,
thank
his
informer
,
proceed
directly
to
it
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
the
opinion
of
two
lawyer
concern
the
same
gentleman
,
with
Mr
Adams
's
inquiry
into
the
religion
of
his
host
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
just
enter
the
house
,
and
call
for
his
pint
,
and
seat
himself
,
when
two
horseman
come
to
the
door
,
and
,
fasten
their
horse
to
the
rail
,
alight
.
<EOS>
They
say
there
be
a
violent
shower
of
rain
come
on
,
which
they
intend
to
weather
there
,
and
go
into
a
little
room
by
themselves
,
not
perceive
Mr
Adams
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
these
immediately
ask
the
other
,
"
if
he
have
see
a
more
comical
adventure
a
great
while
?
<EOS>
"
upon
which
the
other
say
,
"
He
doubt
whether
,
by
law
,
the
landlord
could
justify
detain
the
horse
for
his
corn
and
hay
.
"
<EOS>
but
the
former
answer
,
"
undoubtedly
he
can
;
it
be
an
adjudged
case
,
and
I
have
know
it
try
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adams
,
who
,
though
he
be
,
as
the
reader
may
suspect
,
a
little
inclined
to
forgetfulness
,
never
want
more
than
a
hint
to
remind
him
,
overhear
their
discourse
,
immediately
suggest
to
himself
that
this
be
his
own
horse
,
and
that
he
have
forget
to
pay
for
him
,
which
,
upon
inquiry
,
he
be
certify
of
by
the
gentleman
;
who
add
,
that
the
horse
be
likely
to
have
more
rest
than
food
,
unless
he
be
pay
for
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
parson
resolve
to
return
presently
to
the
inn
,
though
he
know
no
more
than
Joseph
how
to
procure
his
horse
his
liberty
;
he
be
,
however
,
prevail
on
to
stay
under
covert
,
till
the
shower
,
which
be
now
very
violent
,
be
over
.
  
<EOS>
the
three
traveller
then
sit
down
together
over
a
mug
of
good
beer
;
when
Adams
,
who
have
observe
a
gentleman
's
house
as
he
pass
along
the
road
,
inquire
to
whom
it
belong
;
one
of
the
horseman
have
no
sooner
mention
the
owner
's
name
,
than
the
other
begin
to
revile
him
in
the
most
opprobrious
term
.
<EOS>
the
english
language
scarce
afford
a
single
reproachful
word
,
which
he
do
not
vent
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
charge
him
likewise
with
many
particular
fact
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
He
no
more
regard
a
field
of
wheat
when
he
be
hunt
,
than
he
do
the
highway
;
that
he
have
injure
several
poor
farmer
by
trample
their
corn
under
his
horse
's
heel
;
and
if
any
of
them
beg
him
with
the
utmost
submission
to
refrain
,
his
horsewhip
be
always
ready
to
do
them
justice
.
"
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
that
he
be
the
great
tyrant
to
the
neighbour
in
every
other
instance
,
and
would
not
suffer
a
farmer
to
keep
a
gun
,
though
he
may
justify
it
by
law
;
and
in
his
own
family
so
cruel
a
master
,
that
he
never
keep
a
servant
a
twelvemonth
.
<EOS>
in
his
capacity
as
a
justice
,
"
continue
he
,
"
he
behave
so
partially
,
that
he
commit
or
acquit
just
as
he
be
in
the
humour
,
without
any
regard
to
truth
or
evidence
;
the
devil
may
carry
any
one
before
him
for
me
;
I
would
rather
be
try
before
some
judge
,
than
be
a
prosecutor
before
him
:
if
I
have
an
estate
in
the
neighbourhood
,
I
would
sell
it
for
half
the
value
rather
than
live
near
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adams
shake
his
head
,
and
say
,
"
He
be
sorry
such
man
be
suffer
to
proceed
with
impunity
,
and
that
rich

set
any
man
above

"
<EOS>
the
reviler
,
a
little
after
,
retire
into
the
yard
,
the
gentleman
who
have
first
mention
his
name
to
Adams
begin
to
assure
him
"
that
his
companion
be
a
prejudiced
person
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
"
say
he
,
"
perhaps
,
that
he
may
have
sometimes
pursue
his
game
over
a
field
of
corn
,
but
he
hath
always
make
the
party
ample
satisfaction
:
that
so
far
from
tyrannise
over
his
neighbour
,
or
take
away
their
gun
,
he
himself
know
several
farmer
not
qualified
,
who
not
only
keep
gun
,
but
kill
game
with
them
;
that
he
be
the
good
of
master
to
his
servant

several
of
them
have
grow
old
in
his
service

that
he
be
the
good
justice
of
peace
in
the
kingdom

and
,
to
his
certain
knowledge
,
have
decide
many
difficult
point
,
which
be
refer
to
him
,
with
the
great
equity
and
the
high
wisdom
;
and
he
verily
believe
,
several
person
would
give
a
year
's
purchase
more
for
an
estate
near
him
,
than
under
the
wing
of
any
other
great
man

"
<EOS>
He
have
just
finish
his
encomium
when
his
companion
return
and
acquaint
him
the
storm
be
over

<EOS>
upon
which
they
presently
mount
their
horse

<EOS>
Adams
,
who
be
in
the
utmost
anxiety
at
those
different
character
of
the
same
person
,
ask
his
host
if
he
know
the
gentleman
:
for
he
begin
to
imagine
they
have
by
mistake
be
speak
of
two
several
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
master

"
answer
the
host
(
a
shrewd
,
cunne
fellow
)
;
"
I
know
the
gentleman

well

they
have
be
speak

I
do
the

speak

him

<EOS>
as
for
ride
over
other
man
's
corn
,
to
my
knowledge
he
hath
not
be
on
horseback
these
two
year
.
<EOS>
I
never
hear
he
do
any
injury
of
that
kind
;
and
as
to
make
reparation
,
he
be
not
so
free
of
his
money
as
that
come
to
neither
.
<EOS>
nor
do
I
ever
hear
of
his
take
away
any
man
's
gun
;
nay
,
I
know
several
who
have
gun
in
their
house
;
but
as
for
kill
game
with
them
,
no
man
be
strict

I
believe
he
would
ruin
any
who
do

<EOS>
You
hear
one
of
the
gentleman
say
he
be
the
bad
master

I
know
all

a

I

not
you

another
world

"
to
which
the
host
answer

"
yes

he
be
no
atheist

you

Adams

He
answer
,
"
God
forbid
he
should
not

"
 
<EOS>
"
and
heaven
and
hell

say
the

<EOS>
the

then
bid
him

not
to
profane
;
for
those

thing
not
to
be

in

"
<EOS>
Adams
ask
him
,
"
why
he
go
to
church
,
if
what
he
learn
there
have
no
influence
on
his
conduct
in

<EOS>
"
I
go
to
church

"
answer
the
host
,
"
to
say
my
prayer
and
behave
godly

<EOS>
"
and
dost
not
thou
,
"
cry
Adams

"
believe
what
thou
hearest
at

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Most
part
of
it

return
the

<EOS>
and
dost
not
thou
then
tremble
,
"
cry
Adams
,
"
at
the
thought
of
eternal
punishment

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
as
for
that
,
master
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
never
once
think
about
it

but
what
signifie
talk
about
matter
so
far
off

<EOS>
the
mug
be
out
,
shall
I
draw
another
?
"
  
<EOS>
whilst
he
be
go
for
that
purpose
,
a
stage
-
coach
drive
up
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
the
coachman
come
into
the
house
be
ask
by
the
mistress
what
passenger
he
have
in
his
coach
?
"
<EOS>
a
parcel
of
squinny
-
gut
b####s
,
"
say
he
;
"
I
have
a
good
mind
to
overturn
them
;
you
will
not
prevail
upon
them
to
drink
anything
,
I
assure
you
.
"
<EOS>
Adams
ask
him
,
"
if
he
have
not
see
a
young
man
on
horseback
on
the
road
"
(
describe
Joseph
)
.
<EOS>
"
aye
,
"
say
the
coachman
,
"
a
gentlewoman
in
my
coach
that
be
his
acquaintance
redeem
him
and
his
horse
;
he
would
have
be
here
before
this
time
,
have
not
the
storm
drive
him
to
shelter
.
"
<EOS>
"
God
bless
her
!
"
<EOS>
say
Adams
,
in
a
rapture
;
nor
could
he
delay
walk
out
to
satisfy
himself
who
this
charitable
woman
be
;
but
what
be
his
surprize
when
he
see
his
old
acquaintance
,
Madam
Slipslop
?
<EOS>
her
indeed
be
not
so
great
,
because
she
have
be
inform
by
Joseph
that
he
be
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
very
civil
be
the
salutation
on
both
side
;
and
Mrs
Slipslop
rebuke
the
hostess
for
deny
the
gentleman
to
be
there
when
she
ask
for
him
;
but
indeed
the
poor
woman
have
not
err
designedly
;
for
Mrs
Slipslop
ask
for
a
clergyman
,
and
she
have
unhappily
mistake
Adams
for
a
person
travel
to
a
neighbouring
fair
with
the
thimble
and
button
,
or
some
other
such
operation
;
for
he
march
in
a
swinging
great
but
short
white
coat
with
black
button
,
a
short
wig
,
and
a
hat
which
,
so
far
from
have
a
black
hatband
,
have
nothing
black
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
Joseph
be
now
come
up
,
and
Mrs
Slipslop
would
have
have
him
quit
his
horse
to
the
parson
,
and
come
himself
into
the
coach
;
but
he
absolutely
refuse
,
say
,
he
thank
Heaven
<EOS>
he
be
well
enough
recover
to
be
very
able
to
ride
;
and
add
,
he
hope
he
know
his
duty
better
than
to
ride
in
a
coach
while
Mr
Adams
be
on
horseback
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Slipslop
would
have
persist
longer
,
have
not
a
lady
in
the
coach
put
a
short
end
to
the
dispute
,
by
refuse
to
suffer
a
fellow
in
a
livery
to
ride
in
the
same
coach
with
herself
;
so
it
be
at
length
agree
that
Adams
should
fill
the
vacant
place
in
the
coach
,
and
Joseph
should
proceed
on
horseback
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
not
proceed
far
before
Mrs
Slipslop
,
address
herself
to
the
parson
,
speak
thus
:
 
<EOS>
"
there
hath
be
a
strange
alteration
in
our
family
,
Mr
Adams
,
since
Sir
Thomas
's
death
.
"
<EOS>
"
a
strange
alteration
indeed
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
as
I
gather
from
some
hint
which
have
drop
from
Joseph
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
aye
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
could
never
have
believe
it
;
but
the
long
one
live
in
the
world
,
the
more
one
see
.
<EOS>
so
Joseph
hath
<EOS>
give
you
hint
.
"
<EOS>
"
but
of
what
nature
will
always
remain
a
perfect
secret
with
me
,
"
cry
the
parson
:
"
he
force
me
to
promise
before
he
would
communicate
anything
.
<EOS>
I
be
indeed
concerned
to
find
her
ladyship
behave
in
so
unbecome
a
manner
.
<EOS>
I
always
think
her
in
the
main
a
good
lady
,
and
should
never
have
suspect
her
of
thought
so
unworthy
a
Christian
,
and
with
a
young
lad
her
own
servant
.
"
<EOS>
"
these
thing
be
no
secret
to
me
,
I
assure
you
,
"
cry
Slipslop
,
"
and
I
believe
they
will
be
none
anywhere
shortly
;
for
ever
since
the
boy
's
departure
,
she
hath
behave
more
like
a
mad
woman
than
anything
else
.
"
<EOS>
"
truly
,
I
be
heartily
concerned
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
for
she
be
a
good
sort
of
a
lady
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
have
often
wish
she
have
attend
a
little
more
constantly
at
the
service
,
but
she
hath
do
a
great
deal
of
good
in
the
parish
.
"
<EOS>
"
O
Mr
Adams
,
"
say
Slipslop
,
"
people
that
do
not
see
all
,
often
know
nothing
.
<EOS>
many
thing
have
be
give
away
in
our
family
,
I
do
assure
you
,
without
her
knowledge
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
you
say
in
the
pulpit
we
ought
not
to
brag
;
but
indeed
I
can
not
avoid
say
,
if
she
have
keep
the
key
herself
,
the
poor
would
have
want
many
a
cordial
which
I
have
let
them
have
.
<EOS>
as
for
my
late
master
,
he
be
as
worthy
a
man
as
ever
live
,
and
would
have
do
infinite
good
if
he
have
not
be
control
;
but
he
love
a
quiet
life
,
Heaven
rest
his
soul
!
<EOS>
I
be
confident
he
be
there
,
and
enjoy
a
quiet
life
,
which
some
folk
would
not
allow
him
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
Adams
answer
,
"
He
have
never
hear
this
before
,
and
be
mistaken
if
she
herself
(
for
he
remember
she
use
to
commend
her
mistress
and
blame
her
master
)
have
not
formerly
be
of
another
opinion
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
reply
she
,
"
what
I
may
once
think
;
but
now
I
be
confidous
matter
<EOS>
be
as
I
tell
you
;
the
world
will
shortly
see
who
hath
be
deceive
;
for
my
part
,
I
say
nothing
,
but
that
it
be
wondersome
how
some
people
can
carry
all
thing
with
a
grave
face
.
"
  
<EOS>
thus
Mr
Adams
and
she
discourse
,
till
they
come
opposite
to
a
great
house
which
stand
at
some
distance
from
the
road
:
a
lady
in
the
coach
,
spy
it
,
cry
,
"
yonder
live
the
unfortunate
Leonora
,
if
one
can
justly
call
a
woman
unfortunate
whom
we
must
own
at
the
same
time
guilty
and
the
author
of
her
own
calamity
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
abundantly
sufficient
to
awaken
the
curiosity
of
Mr
Adams
,
as
indeed
it
do
that
of
the
whole
company
,
who
jointly
solicit
the
lady
to
acquaint
them
with
Leonora
's
history
,
since
it
seem
,
by
what
she
have
say
,
to
contain
something
remarkable
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
,
who
be
perfectly
well
-
breed
,
do
not
require
many
entreaty
,
and
have
only
wish
their
entertainment
may
make
amend
for
the
company
's
attention
,
she
begin
in
the
follow
manner
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
the
history
of
Leonora
,
or
the
unfortunate
jilt
.
  
<EOS>
Leonora
be
the
daughter
of
a
gentleman
of
fortune
;
she
be
tall
and
well
-
shape
,
with
a
sprightliness
in
her
countenance
which
often
attract
beyond
more
regular
feature
join
with
an
insipid
air
:
nor
be
this
kind
of
beauty
less
apt
to
deceive
than
allure
;
the
good
humour
which
it
indicate
be
often
mistake
for
good
nature
,
and
the
vivacity
for
true
understanding
.
  
<EOS>
Leonora
,
who
be
now
at
the
age
of
eighteen
,
live
with
an
aunt
of
her
in
a
town
in
the
north
of
England
.
<EOS>
She
be
an
extreme
lover
of
gaiety
,
and
very
rarely
miss
a
ball
or
any
other
public
assembly
;
where
she
have
frequent
opportunity
of
satisfy
a
greedy
appetite
of
vanity
,
with
the
preference
which
be
give
her
by
the
man
to
almost
every
other
woman
present
.
  
<EOS>
among
many
young
fellow
who
be
particular
in
their
gallantry
towards
her
,
Horatio
soon
distinguish
himself
in
her
eye
beyond
all
his
competitor
;
she
dance
with
more
than
ordinary
gaiety
when
he
happen
to
be
her
partner
;
neither
the
fairness
of
the
evening
,
nor
the
musick
of
the
nightingale
,
could
lengthen
her
walk
like
his
company
.
<EOS>
She
affect
no
longer
to
understand
the
civility
of
other
;
whilst
she
incline
so
attentive
an
ear
to
every
compliment
of
Horatio
,
that
she
often
smile
even
when
it
be
too
delicate
for
her
comprehension
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
madam
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
who
be
this
squire
Horatio
?
"
  
<EOS>
Horatio
,
say
the
lady
,
be
a
young
gentleman
of
a
good
family
,
breed
to
the
law
,
and
have
be
some
few
year
call
to
the
degree
of
a
barrister
.
<EOS>
His
face
and
person
be
such
as
the
generality
allow
handsome
;
but
he
have
a
dignity
in
his
air
very
rarely
to
be
see
.
<EOS>
His
temper
be
of
the
saturnine
complexion
,
and
without
the
least
taint
of
moroseness
.
<EOS>
He
have
wit
and
humour
,
with
an
inclination
to
satire
,
which
he
indulge
rather
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
this
gentleman
,
who
have
contract
the
most
violent
passion
for
Leonora
,
be
the
last
person
who
perceive
the
probability
of
its
success
.
<EOS>
the
whole
town
have
make
the
match
for
him
before
he
himself
have
draw
a
confidence
from
her
action
sufficient
to
mention
his
passion
to
her
;
for
it
be
his
opinion
<EOS>
(
and
perhaps
he
be
there
in
the
right
)
<EOS>
that
it
be
highly
impolitick
to
talk
seriously
of
love
to
a
woman
before
you
have
make
such
a
progress
in
her
affection
,
that
she
herself
expect
and
desire
to
hear
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
whatever
diffidence
the
fear
of
a
lover
may
create
,
which
be
apt
to
magnify
every
favour
confer
on
a
rival
,
and
to
see
the
little
advance
towards
themselves
through
the
other
end
of
the
perspective
,
it
be
impossible
that
Horatio
's
passion
should
so
blind
his
discernment
as
to
prevent
his
conceive
hope
from
the
behaviour
of
Leonora
,
whose
fondness
for
him
be
now
as
visible
to
an
indifferent
person
in
their
company
as
his
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
know
any
of
these
forward
slut
come
to
good
"
(
say
the
lady
who
refuse
Joseph
's
entrance
into
the
coach
)
,
"
nor
shall
I
wonder
at
anything
she
doth
in
the
sequel
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
lady
proceed
in
her
story
thus
:
It
be
in
the
midst
of
a
gay
conversation
in
the
walk
one
evening
,
when
Horatio
whisper
Leonora
,
that
he
be
desirous
to
take
a
turn
or
two
with
her
in
private
,
for
that
he
have
something
to
communicate
to
her
of
great
consequence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
be
you
sure
it
be
of
consequence
?
"
<EOS>
say
she
,
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
answer
he
,
"
you
will
think
so
too
,
since
the
whole
future
happiness
of
my
life
must
depend
on
the
event
.
"
  
<EOS>
Leonora
,
who
very
much
suspect
what
be
come
,
would
have
defer
it
till
another
time
;
but
Horatio
,
who
have
more
than
half
conquer
the
difficulty
of
speak
by
the
first
motion
,
be
so
very
importunate
,
that
she
at
last
yielded
,
and
,
leave
the
rest
of
the
company
,
they
turn
aside
into
an
unfrequented
walk
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
retire
far
out
of
the
sight
of
the
company
,
both
maintain
a
strict
silence
.
<EOS>
at
last
Horatio
make
a
full
stop
,
and
take
Leonora
,
who
stand
pale
and
trembling
,
gently
by
the
hand
,
he
fetch
a
deep
sigh
,
and
then
,
look
on
her
eye
with
all
the
tenderness
imaginable
,
he
cry
out
in
a
falter
accent
,
"
o
Leonora
!
<EOS>
be
it
necessary
for
me
to
declare
to
you
on
what
the
future
happiness
of
my
life
must
be
found
?
<EOS>
Must
I
say
there
be
something
belong
to
you
which
be
a
bar
to
my
happiness
,
and
which
unless
you
will
part
with
,
I
must
be
miserable
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
can
that
be
?
"
reply
Leonora
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
wonder
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
be
surprize
that
I
should
make
an
objection
to
anything
which
be
yours
:
yet
sure
you
may
guess
,
since
it
be
the
only
one
which
the
rich
of
the
world
,
if
they
be
mine
,
should
purchase
for
me
.
<EOS>
oh
,
it
be
that
which
you
must
part
with
to
bestow
all
the
rest
!
<EOS>
Can
Leonora
,
or
rather
will
she
,
doubt
longer
?
<EOS>
let
me
then
whisper
it
in
her
ear
 
<EOS>
It
be
your
name
,
madam
.
<EOS>
It
be
by
part
with
that
,
by
your
condescension
to
be
for
ever
mine
,
which
must
at
once
prevent
me
from
be
the
most
miserable
,
and
will
render
me
the
happy
of
mankind
.
"
  
<EOS>
Leonora
,
cover
with
blush
,
and
with
as
angry
a
look
as
she
could
possibly
put
on
,
tell
him
,
"
that
have
she
suspect
what
his
declaration
would
have
be
,
he
should
not
have
decoy
her
from
her
company
,
that
he
have
so
surprize
and
fright
her
,
that
she
beg
him
to
convey
her
back
as
quick
as
possible
;
"
which
he
,
tremble
very
near
as
much
as
herself
,
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
More
fool
he
,
"
cry
Slipslop
;
"
it
be
a
sign
he
know
very
little
of
our
sect
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
truly
,
madam
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
I
think
you
be
in
the
right
:
I
should
have

HORATIO
to
LEONORA
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
vain
,
most
adorable
creature
,
be
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
in
the
absence
of
an
object
to
which
the
mind
be
entirely
devoted
,
unless
it
have
some
relation
to
that
object
!
<EOS>
I
be
last
night
condemn
to
the
society
of
man
of
wit
and
learning
,
which
,
however
agreeable
it
may
have
formerly
be
to
me
,
now
only
give
me
a
suspicion
that
they
impute
my
absence
in
conversation
to
the
true
cause
.
<EOS>
for
which
reason
,
when
your
engagement
forbid
me
the
ecstatic
happiness
of
see
you
,
I
be
always
desirous
to
be
alone
;
since
my
sentiment
for
Leonora
be
so
delicate
,
that
I
can
not
bear
the
apprehension
of
another
be
pry
into
those
delightful
endearment
with
which
the
warm
imagination
of
a
lover
will
sometimes
indulge
him
,
and
which
I
suspect
my
eye
then
betray
.
<EOS>
to
fear
this
discovery
of
our
thought
may
perhaps
appear
too
ridiculous
a
nicety
to
mind
not
susceptible
of
all
the
tenderness
of
this
delicate
passion
.
<EOS>
and
surely
we
shall
suspect
there
be
few
such
,
when
we
consider
that
it
require
every
human
virtue
to
exert
itself
in
its
full
extent
;
since
the
beloved
,
whose
happiness
it
ultimately
respect
,
may
give
us
charming
opportunity
of
be
brave
in
her
defence
,
generous
to
her
want
,
compassionate
to
her
affliction
,
grateful
to
her
kindness
;
and
in
the
same
manner
,
of
exercise
every
other
virtue
,
which
he
who
would
not
do
to
any
degree
,
and
that
with
the
utmost
rapture
,
can
never
deserve
the
name
of
a
lover
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
therefore
,
with
a
view
to
the
delicate
modesty
of
your
mind
that
I
cultivate
it
so
purely
in
my
own
;
and
it
be
that
which
will
sufficiently
suggest
to
you
the
uneasiness
I
bear
from
those
liberty
,
which
man
to
whom
the
world
allow
politeness
will
sometimes
give
themselves
on
these
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
I
tell
you
with
what
eagerness
<EOS>
I
expect
the
arrival
of
that
bl
day
,
when
I
shall
experience
the
falsehood
of
a
common
assertion
,
that
the
great
human
happiness
consist
in
hope
?
<EOS>
a
doctrine
which
no
person
have
ever
strong
reason
to
believe
than
myself
at
present
,
since
none
ever
taste
such
bliss
as
fire
<EOS>
my
bosom
with
the
thought
of
spend
my
future
day
with
such
a
companion
,
and
that
every
action
of
my
life
will
have
the
glorious
satisfaction
of
conduce
to
your
happiness

the

I
be
surprize

what

if
the
solitary
turn
of

keep
them
undiscovered
,
make
even
the
conversation
of
man
of

learn
tedious
to
you

<EOS>
what
anxious

must
I
spend

woman

it

It
seem

it
be
usual
for
the
young

of
the
bar
to
repair
to
these
session

not
so
much
for
the
sake
of
profit
as
to
show
their

learn
the

It

as
he
hope
by

to
advance
his
fortune

which
be
not
at

very
large
,
for

resolve

spare
no
pain

nor
lose
any
opportunity

improve

advance
himself
in
it

<EOS>
the
same
afternoon
in
which
he
leave
the

as
Leonora
stand
at
her
window

a
coach
and
six
pass
by

which
she
declare
to
be
the
complete

genteel

prettiest
equipage
she
ever
see

add
these
remarkable
word
,
"
oh

I

equipage

,
though
her
friend
Florella
at

do
not
greatly
regard

she
hath
since
remember

in
the
evening
an
assembly
be
hold

Leonora
honour
with

intend
to
pay
her

the
compliment

refuse

good

good

<EOS>
the
gentleman
who
own
the
coach
and
six
come
to
the
assembly
.
<EOS>
His
clothe
be
as
remarkably
fine
as
his
equipage
could
be
.
<EOS>
He
soon
attract
the
eye
of
the
company
;
all
the
smart
,
all
the
silk
waistcoat
with
silver
and
gold
edging
,
be
eclipse
in
an
instant

<EOS>
Sir
,
answer
the
lady
,
I
have
be
tell
he
have
on
a
cut
velvet
coat
of
a
cinnamon
colour
,
line
with
a
pink
satten
,
embroider
all
over
with
gold
;
<EOS>
his
waistcoat
,
which
be
cloth
of
silver
,
be
embroider
with
gold
likewise
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
be
particular
as
to
the
rest
of
his
dress
;
but
it
be
all
in
the
french
fashion
,
for
Bellarmine
(
that
be
his
name
)
be
just
arrive
from
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
this
fine
figure
do
not
more
entirely
engage
the
eye
of
every
lady
in
the
assembly
than
Leonora
do
his
.
<EOS>
He
have
scarce
beheld
her
,
but
he
stand
motionless
and
fix
as
a
statue
,
or
at
least
would
have
do
so
if
good
breeding
have
permit
him
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
carry
it
so
far
before
he
have
power
to
correct
himself
,
that
every
person
in
the
room
easily
discover
where
his
admiration
be
settle
.
<EOS>
the
other
lady
begin
to
single
out
their
former
partner
,
all
perceive
who
would
be
Bellarmine
's
choice
;
which
they
however
endeavour
,
by
all
possible
mean
,
to
prevent
:
many
of
them
say
to
Leonora
,
"
o
madam
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
shall
not
have
the
pleasure
of
see
you
dance
to
-
night
;
"
and
then
cry
out
,
in
Bellarmine
's
hearing
,
"
oh
!
<EOS>
Leonora
will
not
dance
,
I
assure
you
:
her
partner
be
not
here
.
<EOS>
"
one
maliciously
attempt
to
prevent
her
,
by
send
a
disagreeable
fellow
to
ask
her
,
that
so
she
may
be
oblige
either
to
dance
with
him
,
or
sit
down
;
but
this
scheme
prove
abortive
.
  
<EOS>
Leonora
see
herself
admire
by
the
fine
stranger
,
and
envy
by
every
woman
present
.
<EOS>
Her
little
heart
begin
to
flutter
within
her
,
and
her
head
be
agitate
with
a
convulsive
motion
<EOS>
:
she
seem
as
if
she
would
speak
to
several
of
her
acquaintance
,
but
have
nothing
to
say
;
for
,
as
she
would
not
mention
her
present
triumph
,
so
she
could
not
disengage
her
thought
one
moment
from
the
contemplation
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
taste
anything
like
this
happiness
.
<EOS>
She
have
before
know
what
it
be
to
torment
a
single
woman
;
but
to
be
hate
and
secretly
curse
by
a
whole
assembly
be
a
joy
reserve
for
this
blessed
moment
.
<EOS>
as
this
vast
profusion
of
ecstasy
have
confound
her
understanding
,
so
there
be
nothing
so
foolish
as
her
behaviour
:
she
play
a
thousand
childish
trick
,
distort
her
person
into
several
shape
,
and
her
face
into
several
laugh
,
without
any
reason
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
her
carriage
be
as
absurd
as
her
desire
,
which
be
to
affect
an
insensibility
of
the
stranger
's
admiration
,
and
at
the
same
time
a
triumph
,
from
that
admiration
,
over
every
woman
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
temper
of
mind
,
Bellarmine
,
have
inquire
who
she
be
,
advanced
to
her
,
and
with
a
low
bow
beg
the
honour
of
dance
with
her
,
which
she
,
with
as
low
a
curtesy
,
immediately
grant
.
<EOS>
She
dance
with
him
all
night
,
and
enjoy
,
perhaps
,
the
high
pleasure
that
she
be
capable
of
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
at
these
word
,
Adams
fetch
a
deep
groan
,
which
fright
the
lady
,
who
tell
him
,
"
They
hope
he
be
not
ill
.
"
<EOS>
He
answer
,
"
He
groan
only
for
the
folly
of
Leonora
.
"
  
<EOS>
Leonora
retire
(
<EOS>
continue
the
lady
)
<EOS>
about
six
in
the
morning
,
but
not
to
rest
.
<EOS>
She
tumble
and
toss
in
her
bed
,
with
very
short
interval
of
sleep
,
and
those
entirely
fill
with
dream
of
the
equipage
and
fine
clothe
she
have
see
,
and
the
ball
,
opera
,
and
ridotto
,
which
have
be
the
subject
of
their
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
,
Bellarmine
,
in
the
dear
coach
and
six
,
come
to
wait
on
her
.
<EOS>
He
be
indeed
charm
with
her
person
,
and
be
,
on
inquiry
,
so
well
pleased
with
the
circumstance
of
her
father
(
for
he
himself
,
notwithstanding
all
his
finery
,
be
not
quite
so
rich
as
a
Croesus
or
an
Attalus
)
.
 
<EOS>
"
Attalus
,
"
say
Mr.
Adams
:
"
but
pray
how
come
you
acquaint
with
these
name
?
<EOS>
"
the
lady
smile
at
the
question
,
and
proceed
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
pleased
,
I
say
,
that
he
resolve
to
make
his
address
to
her
directly
.
<EOS>
He
do
so
accordingly
,
and
that
with
so
much
warmth
and
briskness
,
that
he
quickly
baffle
her
weak
repulse
,
and
oblige
the
lady
to
refer
him
to
her
father
,
who
,
she
know
,
would
quickly
declare
in
favour
of
a
coach
and
six
.
  
<EOS>
thus
what
Horatio
have
by
sigh
and
tear
,
love
and
tenderness
,
be
so
long
obtain
,
the
french
-
English
Bellarmine
with
gaiety
and
gallantry
possess
himself
of
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
in
other
word
,
what
modesty
have
employ
a
full
year
in
raising
,
impudence
demolish
in
twenty
-
four
hour
.
  
<EOS>
here
Adams
groan
a
second
time
;
but
the
lady
,
who
begin
to
smoke
him
,
take
no
notice
.
  
<EOS>
from
the
opening
of
the
assembly
till
the
end
of
Bellarmine
's
visit
,
Leonora
have
scarce
once
think
of
Horatio
;
but
he
now
begin
,
though
an
unwelcome
guest
,
to
enter
into
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
wish
she
have
see
the
charming
Bellarmine
and
his
charming
equipage
before
matter
have
go
so
far
.
"
<EOS>
yet
why
,
"
say
she
,
"
should
I
wish
to
have
see
him
before
;
or
what
signify
it
that
I
have
see
him
now
?
<EOS>
be
not
Horatio
my
lover
,
almost
my
husband
?
<EOS>
be
he
not
as
handsome
,
nay
handsome
than
Bellarmine
?
<EOS>
aye
,
but
Bellarmine
be
the
genteeler
,
and
the
fine
man
;
yes
,
that
he
must
be
allow
.
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
he
be
that
certainly
.
<EOS>
but
do
not
I
,
no
longer
ago
than
yesterday
,
love
horatio
more
than
all
the
world
?
<EOS>
aye
,
but
yesterday
I
have
not
see
Bellarmine
.
<EOS>
but
doth
not
Horatio
doat
on
me
,
and
may
he
not
in
despair
break
his
heart
if
I
abandon
him
?
<EOS>
well
,
and
hath
not
Bellarmine
a
heart
to
break
too
?
<EOS>
yes
,
but
I
promise
Horatio
first
;
but
that
be
poor
Bellarmine
's
misfortune
;
if
I
have
see
him
first
,
I
should
certainly
have
prefer
him
.
<EOS>
do
not
the
dear
creature
prefer
me
to
every
woman
in
the
assembly
,
when
every
she
be
lay
out
for
him
?
<EOS>
when
be
it
in
Horatio
's
power
to
give
me
such
an
instance
of
affection
?
<EOS>
Can
he
give
me
an
equipage
,
or
any
of
those
thing
which
Bellarmine
will
make
me
mistress
of
?
<EOS>
how
vast
be
the
difference
between
be
the
wife
of
a
poor
counsellor
and
the
wife
of
one
of
Bellarmine
's
fortune
!
<EOS>
if
I
marry
Horatio
,
I
shall
triumph
over
no
more
than
one
rival
;
but
by
marry
Bellarmine
,
I
shall
be
the
envy
of
all
my
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
what
happiness
!
<EOS>
but
can
I
suffer
Horatio
to
die
?
<EOS>
for
he
hath
swear
he
can
not
survive
my
loss
:
but
perhaps
he
may
not
die
:
if
he
should
,
can
I
prevent
it
?
<EOS>
Must
I
sacrifice
myself
to
him
?
<EOS>
besides
,
Bellarmine
may
be
as
miserable
for
me
too
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
thus
argue
with
herself
,
when
some
young
lady
call
her
to
the
walk
,
and
a
little
relieve
her
anxiety
for
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
Bellarmine
breakfast
with
her
in
presence
of
her
aunt
,
whom
he
sufficiently
inform
of
his
passion
for
Leonora

<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
withdraw
than
the
old
lady
begin
to
advise
her
niece
on
this
occasion

<EOS>
"
You

she
,
"
what
fortune
hath
throw
in
your

I
hope
you
will
not

<EOS>
Leonora
,
sighing
,
beg
her
not

any
such
thing
,

she
know
her
engagement
to
Horatio

"
engagement
to
a
fig
!

the
aunt
;

you
should
thank
Heaven
on
your
knee
that
you
have
it
yet
in
your

Will
any
woman
hesitate
a
moment
whether
she
shall
ride
in
a
coach
or
walk
on
foot
all
the
day
of
her
life

Bellarmine
drive
six
,
and
Horatio
not
even
a

<EOS>
"
yes

,
madam
,
what
will
the

say
?

answer
Leonora
:

will
not
they
condemn

<EOS>
"
the
world
be
always
on
the
side
of
prudence

the
aunt

and
would
surely
condemn
you
if
you
sacrifice
your
interest
to
any
motive
whatever

!

I
know
the
world
very

the

I
have
live
longer
in
it

you

I
assure
you
there
be
not
anything
worth
our
regard
besides
money

nor
do
I
ever
know
one
person
who
marry
from

consideration

who
do
not
afterwards
heartily

it

you

fellow

who
hath
be
breed
at

university

to

all
the

Bellarmine
to

fine
gentleman

positively
a
fine
gentleman

a
handsome
man

Leonora
be
at
length
satisfy
with
her
aunt
's
reasoning
;
and
Bellarmine
sup
with
her
that
evening

it
be
agree
he
should
the
next
morning
go
to
her
father

propose
the
match

consummate
at

the
aunt
retire
soon
after
supper
;

,
the
lover
be
leave
together
,
Bellarmine
begin
in
the
follow
manner
:
"
yes
,
madam
;
this
coat
,
I
assure
you
,
be
make
at
Paris
,

I
defy
the
good
english
taylor
even
to
imitate
it

there
be
not
one
of

can
cut
,
madam
;
they
can
not
cut
.
<EOS>
if
you
observe
how
this
skirt
be
turn
,
and
this
sleeve
:
a
clumsy
english
rascal
can
do
nothing
like
it
.
<EOS>
pray
,
how
do
you
like
my
livery
?
"
<EOS>
Leonora
answer
,
"
She
think
them
very
pretty
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
all
French
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
assure
you
,
except
the
greatcoat
;
I
never
trust
anything
more
than
a
greatcoat
to
an
Englishman
.
<EOS>
You
know
one
must
encourage
our
own
people
<EOS>
what
one
can
,
especially
as
,
before
I
have
a
place
,
I
be
in
the
country
interest
,
he
,
he
,
he
!
<EOS>
but
for
myself
,
I
would
see
the
dirty
island
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
,
rather
than
wear
a
single
rag
of
english
work
about
me
:
and
I
be
sure
,
after
you
have
make
one
tour
to
Paris
,
you
will
be
of
the
same
opinion
with
regard
to
your
own
clothe
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
conceive
what
an
addition
a
french
dress
would
be
to
your
beauty
;
I
positively
assure
you
,
at
the
first
opera
I
see
since
I
come
over
,
I
mistake
the
english
lady
for
chambermaid
,
he
,
he
,
he
!
"
  
<EOS>
with
such
sort
of
polite
discourse
do
the
gay
Bellarmine
entertain
his
beloved
Leonora
,
when
the
door
open
on
a
sudden
,
and
Horatio
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
here
'
tis
impossible
to
express
the
surprize
of
Leonora
.
  
<EOS>
"
poor
woman
!

Mrs
Slipslop

what
a

quandary
she
must

more

Adams

more
than

<EOS>
a
long
silence

continue
the
lady
,
prevail
in
the
whole
company

<EOS>
if
the
familiar
entrance
of
Horatio
strike
the
great
astonishment
into
Bellarmine
,
the
unexpected
presence
of
Bellarmine
no
less
surprized
Horatio
.
<EOS>
at
length
Leonora
,
collect
all
the
spirit
she
be
mistress
of
,
address
herself
to
the
latter
,
and
pretend
to
wonder
at
the
reason
of
so
late
a
visit
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
indeed
,
"
answer
he
,
"
have
make
some
apology
for
disturb
you
at
this
hour

not
my
finding
you
in
company

me
I
do
not
break
in
upon
your
repose

"
<EOS>
Bellarmine
rise
from
his
chair
,
traverse
the
room
in
a
minuet
step
,
and
hum
an
opera
tune
,
while
Horatio
,
advance
to
Leonora
,
ask
her
in
a
whisper
if
that
gentleman
be
not
a
relation
of
her
;
to
which
she
answer
with
a
smile
,
or
rather
sneer
,
"
no
,
he
be
no
relation
of
mine
yet
;
"
add
,
"
she
could
not
guess
the
meaning
of
his
question
.
"
<EOS>
Horatio
tell
her
softly
,
"
It
do
not
arise
from
jealousy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Jealousy
!
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
it
would
be
very
strange
in
a
common
acquaintance
to
give
himself
any
of
those
air
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
these
word
a
little
surprized
Horatio
;
but
,
before
he
have
time
to
answer
,
Bellarmine
dance
up
to
the
lady
and
tell
her
,
"
He
fear
he
interrupt
some
business
between
her
and
the
gentleman
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
have
no
business
,
"
say
she
,
"
with
the
gentleman
,
nor
any
other
,
which
need
be
any
secret
to
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
pardon
me
,
"
say
Horatio
,
"
if
I
desire
to
know
who
this
gentleman
be

be
to

entrust
with
all
our
secret

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
know
soon
enough

cry
Leonora
;
"
but
I
can
not
guess
what
secret
can
ever
pass
between
us
of
such
mighty
consequence

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
madam
!

<EOS>
cry
Horatio
<EOS>
;

I
be
sure
you
would

<EOS>
"
'
Tis
indifferent
to
me
,

she
,
"
<EOS>
how
you
understand
me

I
think
so
unseasonable
a
visit
be
difficult
to
be
understand
at
all
,
at
least
when
people
find
one
engage
:
though
one
's
servant
do
not
deny
one
,
one
may
expect
a
well
-
breed
person
should
soon
take
the
hint

"
Madam
,
"
say
Horatio
,
"
I
do
not
imagine
any
engagement
with
a
stranger

as
it
seem
this
gentleman

would
have

visit
impertinent

you

know
no

to
lay
aside
the
ceremony

good
breeding

sure

"
I
be
in
a
dream

it
be
impossible

after
what

you

me
,
affront
the
lady

Bellarmine

cock
his
hat
,
and
strut
up
to
Horatio
:

do
any
man
dare
affront
this
lady
before
me

me

<EOS>
"
Hark'ee
,
sir
,
"
say
Horatio
,
"
I
would
advise
you
to
lay
aside
that
fierce
air
;
for
I
be
mightily
deceive
if
this
lady
have
not
a
violent
desire
to
get
your
worship
a
good
drubbing

"
Sir

Bellarmine

"
I
have
the
honour
to

d####n
me

if
I

your
meaning

"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
answer
Horatio
,
"
she
be
rather
your
protectress
;

give
yourself
no
more
air

you

I
be
prepared

you

(
shake
his
whip
at
him

.
<EOS>
"
oh
!
serviteur
tre
humble
,
"
say
bellarmine
:
"
<EOS>
je
vous
entend
parfaitment
bien

"
at
which
time
the
aunt
,
who
have
hear
of
Horatio
's
visit
,
enter
the
room
,
and
soon
satisfy
all
his
doubt
.
<EOS>
She
convince
him
that
he
be
never
more
awake
in
his
life
,
and
that
nothing
more
extraordinary
have
happen
in
his
three
day
'
absence
than
a
small
alteration
in
the
affection
of
Leonora
;
who
now
burst
into
tear
,
and
wonder
what
reason
she
have
give
him
to
use
her
in
so
barbarous
a
manner
.
<EOS>
Horatio
desire
Bellarmine
to
withdraw
with
him
;
but
the
lady
prevent
it
by
lay
violent
hand
on
the
latter
;
upon
which
the
former
take
his
leave
without
any
great
ceremony
,
and
depart
,
leave
the
lady
with
his
rival
to
consult
for
his
safety
,
which
Leonora
fear
her
indiscretion
may
have
endanger
;
but
the
aunt
comfort
her
with
assurance
that
Horatio
would
not
venture
his
person
against
<EOS>
so
accomplish
a
cavalier
as
Bellarmine
,
and
that
,
be
a
lawyer
,
he
would
seek
revenge
in
his
own
way
,
and
the
most
they
have
to
apprehend
from
him
be
an
action
.
  
<EOS>
They
at
length
therefore
agree
to
permit
Bellarmine
to
retire
to
his
lodging
,
have
first
settle
all
matter
relate
to
the
journey
which
he
be
to
undertake
in
the
morning
,
and
their
preparation
for
the
nuptial
at
his
return
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
as
wise
man
have
observe
,
the
seat
of
valour
be
not
the
countenance
;
and
many
a
grave
and
plain
man
will
,
on
a
just
provocation
,
betake
himself
to
that
mischievous
metal
,
cold
iron
;
while
man
of
a
fiercer
brow
,
and
sometimes
with
that
emblem
of
courage
,
a
cockade
,
will
more
prudently
decline
it
.
  
<EOS>
Leonora
be
wake
in
the
morning
,
from
a
visionary
coach
and
six
,
with
the
dismal
account
that
Bellarmine
be
run
through
the
body
by
Horatio
;
that
he
lie
languish
at
an
inn
,
and
the
surgeon
have
declare
the
wound
mortal
.
<EOS>
She
immediately
leap
out
of
the
bed
,
dance
about
the
room
in
a
frantic
manner
,
tear
her
hair
and
beat
her
breast
in
all
the
agony
of
despair
;
in
which
sad
condition
her
aunt
,
who
likewise
arise
at
the
news
,
find
her
.
<EOS>
the
good
old
lady
apply
her
utmost
art
to
comfort
her
niece

<EOS>
She
tell
her
,
"
while
there
be
life
there
be
hope
;
but
that
if
he
should
die
her
affliction
would
be
of
no
service
to
Bellarmine
,
and
would
only
expose
herself
,
which
may
,
probably
,
keep
her
some
time
without
any
future
offer
;
that
,
as
matter
have
happen
,
her
wise
way
would
be
to
think
no
more
of
Bellarmine
,
but
to
endeavour
to
regain
the
affection
of
Horatio
.
"
<EOS>
"
speak
not
to
me
,
"
cry
the
disconsolate
Leonora
;

be
it
not
owing
to

<EOS>
no

I
have

the

<EOS>
the

almost
bear
down
with
this
torrent
of
word

however

rally
all
the
strength
she

draw
her
mouth
up
in

those

that

some
pretty
valuable

have
pass
from

have

brilliant
from

it

she
may
be

little
alarm

to
the

Mr

he
be
,
as

guess

of
an
insatiable
curiosity

heartily
desirous

profess
he

a
dreadful
quarrel

Mr

make
directly
to
the
kitchen

where
he
find
Joseph
sit
by

fire

anoint
his
leg

for
the
horse

Mr

have
borrow
of
his
clerk
have
so
violent
a
propensity
to
kneel

that
one

it

on
his
knee
when
the

least
expect
it

<EOS>
this
foible
,
however
,
be
of
no
great
inconvenience
to
the
parson
,
who
be
accustomed
to
it
;

,
as
his
leg
almost
touch
the
ground
when
he
bestrode
the
beast

have
but
a
little
way
to
fall

throw
himself
forward

Poor

who
have
not

such
kind
of
cattle

though
an
excellent
horseman
,
do
not
so
happily
disengage
himself

fall
with
his

apply
a
warm

with
some
camphorate
spirit

just
at
the
time

the
parson
enter

kitchen

<EOS>
He
have
scarce
express
his
concern

misfortune
before

He
be

indeed

perfect
master

his

<EOS>
this
surly
fellow

who
always
proportion
his

to
the
appearance

a
traveller

"
you
know
they
can
have
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
be
at
the
fire

which
will
be
ready
presently

really
the
poor
young
man

leg
be
very
much
bruise
.

"
at
which
word
she
fall
to
chafe
more
violently
than
before
:
the
bell
then
happen
to
ring
,
he
damn'd
his
wife
,
and
bid
her
go
in
to
the
company
,
and
not
stand
rub
there
all
day
,
for
he
do
not
believe
the
young
fellow
's
leg
be
so
bad
as
he
pretend
;
and
if
it
be
,
within
twenty
mile
he
would
find
a
surgeon
to
cut
it
off
.
<EOS>
upon
these
word
,
Adams
fetch
two
stride
across
the
room
;
and
snap
his
finger
over
his
head
,
mutter
aloud
,
He
would
excommunicate
such
a
wretch
for
a
farthing
,
for
he
believe
the
devil
have
more
humanity
.
<EOS>
these
word
occasion
a
dialogue
between
Adams
and
the
host
,
in
which
there
be
two
or
three
sharp
reply
,
till
Joseph
bad
<EOS>
the
latter
know
how
to
behave
himself
to
his
better
.
<EOS>
at
which
the
host
(
have
first
strictly
survey
Adams
)
scornfully
repeat
the
word
"
better
,
"
fly
into
a
rage
,
and
,
tell
Joseph
he
be
as
able
to
walk
out
of
his
house
as
he
have
be
to
walk
into
it
,
offer
to
lay
violent
hand
on
him
;
which
perceiving
,
Adams
deal
him
<EOS>
so
sound
a
compliment
over
his
face
with
his
fist
,
that
the
blood
immediately
gush
out
of
his
nose
in
a
stream
.
<EOS>
the
host
,
be
unwilling
to
be
outdo
in
courtesy
,
especially
by
a
person
of
Adams
's
figure
,
return
the
favour
with
so
much
gratitude
,
that
the
parson
's
nostril
begin
to
look
a
little
red
than
usual
.
<EOS>
upon
which
he
again
assail
his
antagonist
,
and
with
another
stroke
lay
him
sprawl
on
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
the
hostess
,
who
be
a
well
wife
than
so
surly
a
husband
deserve
,
see
her
husband
all
bloody
and
stretch
along
,
hasten
presently
to
his
assistance
,
or
rather
to
revenge
the
blow
,
which
,
to
all
appearance
,
be
the
last
he
would
ever
receive
;
when
,
lo
!
<EOS>
a
pan
full
of
hog
's
blood
,
which
unluckily
stand
on
the
dresser
,
present
itself
first
to
her
hand

<EOS>
She
seize
it
in
her
fury
,
and
without
any
reflection
,
discharge
it
into
the
parson
's
face
;
and
with
so
good
an
aim
,
that
much
the
great
part
first
salute
his
countenance

and
trickle
thence
in
so
large
a
current
down

his
beard

over
his
garment

horrible
spectacle

all
which

by
Mrs

who
enter
the
kitchen
at
that
instant

<EOS>
this
good
gentlewoman

of
a
temper
so
extremely
cool
and
patient
as
perhaps
be
require
to
ask
many
question
on
this
occasion

fly
with
great
impetuosity
at
the
hostess
's
cap
,
which
,
together
with
some
of
her
hair
,
she
pluck
from
her
head
in
a
moment
,
give
her
,
at
the
same
time
,
several
hearty
cuff
in
the
face
;
which
by
frequent
practice
on
the
inferior
servant
,
she
have
learn
an
excellent
knack
of
deliver
with
a
good
grace

<EOS>
poor
Joseph
could
hardly
rise
from
his
chair
;
the
parson
be
employ
in
wipe
the
blood
from
his
eye
,
which
have
entirely
blind
him
;
and
the
landlord
be
but
just
begin
to
stir
;
whilst
Mrs
Slipslop
,
hold
down
the
landlady
's
face
with
her
left
hand
,
make
so
dexterous
an
use
of
her
right
,
that
the
poor
woman
begin
to
roar
,
in
a
key
which
alarm
all
the
company
in
the
inn
.
  
<EOS>
there
happen
to
be
in
the
inn

at
this
time

besides
the

be
detain
for
his
horse

meat
,
and
whom
we
have
before
mention
to
have
stopt
at
the
alehouse
with
Adams
.
<EOS>
there
be
likewise
a
gentleman
just
return
from
his
travel
to
Italy
;
all
whom
the
horrid
outcry
of
murder
presently
bring
into
the
kitchen
,
where
the
several
combatant
be
find
in
the
posture
already
describe
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
no
difficulty
to
put
an
end
to
the
fray
,
the
conqueror
be
satisfied
with
the
vengeance
they
have
take
,
and
the
conquered
have
no
appetite
to
renew
the
fight
.
<EOS>
the
principal
figure
,
and
which
engage
the
eye
of
all
,
be
Adams
,
who
be
all
over
cover
with
blood
,
which
the
whole
company
conclude
to
be
his
own
,
and
consequently
imagine
him
no
longer
for
this
world
.
<EOS>
but
the
host
,
who
have
now
recover
from
his
blow
,
and
be
rise
from
the
ground
,
soon
deliver
them
from
this
apprehension
,
by
damn
his
wife
for
waste
the
hog
's
pudding
,
and
tell
her
all
would
have
be
very
well
if
she
have
not
intermeddle
,
like
a
b
 
as
she
be
;
add
,
he
be
very
glad
the
gentlewoman
have
pay
her
,
though
not
half
what
she
deserve
.
<EOS>
the
poor
woman
have
indeed
fare
much
the
bad
;
have
,
besides
the
unmerciful
cuff
receive
,
lose
a
quantity
of
hair
,
which
Mrs
Slipslop
in
triumph
hold
in
her
left
hand
.
  
<EOS>
the
traveller
,
address
himself
to
Mrs
Grave
-
air
,
desire
her
not
to
be
frighten
;
for
here
have
be
only
a
little
boxing
,
which
he
say
,
to
their
disgracia
,
the
English
be
accustomata
to
:
add
,
it
must
be
,
however
,
a
sight
somewhat
strange
to
him
,
who
be
just
come
from
Italy
;
the
Italians
not
be
addict
to
the
cuffardo
but
bastonza
,
say
he
.
<EOS>
He
then
go
up
to
Adams
,
and
tell
him
he
look
like
the
ghost
of
Othello
,
bid
him
not
shake
his
gory
lock
at
him
,
for
he
could
not
say
he
do
it
.
<EOS>
Adams
very
innocently
answer
,
"
Sir
,
I
be
far
from
accuse
you
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
return
to
the
lady
,
and
cry
,
"
I

Dammato
di

,
if
I
have
see
such
a
spectaculo
in
my

from
Viterbo

<EOS>
one
of
the

learn
from
the

the

of
this

assure
by
him
that
Adams

He

the

:
"
<EOS>
yes
,
yes

I
be
not
afraid
of

I

as
that

"
 
<EOS>
"
pugh
!
"
say
the
gentleman
,
"
<EOS>
I
mean
you
will
recover
damage
in
that
action
which
,
undoubtedly
,
you
intend
to
bring
,
as
soon
as
a
writ
can
be
return
from
London
;
for
you
look
like
a
man
of
too
much
spirit
and
courage
to
suffer
any
one
to
beat
you
without
bring
your
action
against
him
:
he
must
be
a
scandalous
fellow
indeed
who
would
put
up
with
a
drubbing
whilst
the
law
be
open
to
revenge
it
;
<EOS>
besides
,
he
hath
drawn
blood
from
you
,
and
spoil
your
coat
;
and
the
jury
will
give
damage
for
that
too
.
<EOS>
an
excellent
new
coat
upon
my
word
;
and
now
not
worth
a
shilling
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
,
"
continue
he
,
"
to
intermeddle
in
these
case
;
but
you
have
a
right
to
my
evidence
;
and
if
I
be
swear
,
I
must
speak
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
see
you
sprawl
on
the
floor
,
and
blood
gush
from
your
nostril
.
<EOS>
You
may
take
your
own
opinion
;
but
be
I
in
your
circumstance
,
every
drop
of
my
blood
should
convey
an
ounce
of
gold
into
my
pocket
:
<EOS>
remember
I
do
not
advise
you
to
go
to
law
;
but
if
your
jury
be
Christians
,
they
must
give
swinge
damage
.
<EOS>
that
be
all

<EOS>
"
Master

"
cry
the
host
,
scratch
his
head
,
"
I
have
no
stomach
to
law
,
I
thank
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
enough
of
that
in
the
parish
,
where
two
of
my
neighbour
have
be
at
law
about
a
house
,
till
they
have
both
lawe
themselves
into
a
gaol
.

<EOS>
at
which
word
he
turn
about
,
and
begin
to
inquire
again
after
his
hog
's
pudding
;
nor
would
it
probably
have
be
a
sufficient
excuse
for
his
wife
,
that
she
spill
them
in
his
defence
,
have
not
some
awe
of
the
company
,
especially
of
the
italian
traveller
,
who
be
a
person
of
great
dignity
,
withhold
his
rage

<EOS>
whilst
one
of

we
have
see
him

on
the
behalf
of
the
landlord

the
other
be
no
less
hearty
on
the
side
of
Mr
Adams
,
whom
he
advise
to
bring
his
action
immediately
.
<EOS>
He
say
the
assault
of
the
wife
be
in
law
the
assault
of
the
husband
,
for
they
be
but
one
person
;
and
he
be
liable
to
pay
damage
,
which
he
say
must
be
considerable
,
where
so
bloody
a
disposition
appear

<EOS>
Adams
answer
,
if
it
be
true
that
they
be
but
one
person
,
he
have
assault
the

he
be
sorry

own
<EOS>
he
have
strike
the

the
first
blow

<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
you
own
it
too

"
cry
the
gentleman
;
"
for
it
could
not
possibly
appear
to
the
court

here
be
no
evidence
present

the
lame
man
in
the
chair
,
whom
I
suppose
to
be
your

would
consequently
say
nothing

what

<EOS>
"
how

sir

Adams

do
you
take
me
for
a
villain

at
the

bloody
to

a
reception
different

<EOS>
the

who

the
anger
of

whilst
<EOS>
she
conceive
her
the
daughter

small
fortune

now
she
hear
her
alliance
with
the
upper
servant
of
a
great
family

to
fear
her
interest

<EOS>
She
wish
she
have
not
carry
the
dispute
so
far
,
and
begin
to
think
of
endeavour
to
reconcile
herself
to
the
young
lady
before
she
leave

inn

when

luckily
,
the
scene
at
London
,
which
the
reader
can
scarce
have

present
itself
to
her

<EOS>
everything
be
now
adjust

the
company
enter
the

which
be
just
on
its
departure

when
one
lady
recollect
she
have
leave
her
fan
,
a
second
her
glove
,
a
third
a
snuff
-
box
,
and
a
fourth
a
smell
-
bottle
behind
her
;
to
find
all
which
occasion
some
delay
and
much
swearing
to
the
coachman
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
coach
have
leave
the
inn
,
the
woman
all
together
fall
to
the
character
of
Miss
Grave
-
air
;
whom
one
of
them
declare
she
have
suspect
to
be
some
low
creature
,
from
the
beginning
of
their
journey
,
and
another
affirmed
she
have
not
even
the
look
of
a
gentlewoman
:
a
third
warrant
she
be
no
well
than
she
should
be
;
and
,
turn
to
the
lady
who
have
relate
the
story
in
the
coach
,
<EOS>
say
,
"
do
you
ever
hear
,
madam

anything
so
prudish
as
her
remark
?
<EOS>
well
,
deliver
me
from
the
censoriousness
of
such
a
prude
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
fourth
add
,
"
o
madam
!
<EOS>
all
these
creature
be
censorious
;
but
for
my
part
,
I
wonder
where
the
wretch
be
breed
;
indeed
,
I
must
own
<EOS>
I
have
seldom
converse
with
these
mean
kind
of
people
,
so
that
it
may
appear
strange
to
me
;
but
to
refuse
the
general
desire
of
a
whole
company
have
something
in
it
so
astonishing
,
that
,
for
my
part
,
I
own
I
should
hardly
believe
it
if
my
own
ear
have
not
be
witness
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
and
so
handsome
a
young
fellow
,
"
cry
slipslop
;
"
the
woman
must
have
no
compulsion
in
her
<EOS>
:
I
believe
she
be
more
of
a
Turk
than
a
Christian
;
I
be
certain
,
if
she
have
any
christian
woman
's
blood
in
her
vein
,
the
sight
of
such
a
young
fellow
must
have
warm
it
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
there
be
some
wretched
,
miserable
old
object
,
that
turn
one
's
stomach
;
I
should
not
wonder
if
she
have
refuse
such
a
one
;
I
be
as
nice
as
herself
,
and
should
have
care
no
more
than
herself
for
the
company
of
stink
old
fellow
;
but
,
hold
up
thy
head
,
Joseph
,
thou
art
none
of
those
;
and
she
who
hath
not
compulsion
for
thee
be
a
Myhummetman
,
and
I
will
maintain
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
conversation
make
Joseph
uneasy
as
well
as
the
lady
;
who
,
perceive
the
spirit
which
Mrs
Slipslop
be
in
(
for
indeed
she
be
not
a
cup
too
low
)
,
begin
to
fear
the
consequence
;
one
of
them
therefore
desire
the
lady
to
conclude
the
story
.
<EOS>
"
aye
,
madam
,
"
say
Slipslop
,
"
I
beg
your
ladyship
to
give
us
that
story
you
commensate
in
the
morning
;
"
which
request
that
well
-
breed
woman
immediately
comply
with
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
conclusion
of
the
unfortunate
jilt
.
  
<EOS>
Leonora
,
have
once
break
through
the
bound
which
custom
and
modesty
impose
on
her
sex
,
soon
give
an
unbridled
indulgence
to
her
passion
.
<EOS>
Her
visit
to
Bellarmine
be
more
constant
,
as
well
as
longer
,
than
his
surgeon
's
:
in
a
word
,
she
become
absolutely
his
nurse
;
make
his
water
-
gruel
,
administer
him
his
medicine
;
and
,
notwithstanding
the
prudent
advice
of
her
aunt
to
the
contrary
,
almost
intirely
reside
in
her
wounded
lover
's
apartment
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
of
the
town
begin
to
take
her
conduct
under
consideration
:
it
be
the
chief
topic
of
discourse
at
their
tea
-
table
,
and
be
very
severely
censure
by
the
most
part
;
especially
by
Lindamira
,
a
lady
whose
discreet
and
starch
carriage
,
together
with
a
constant
attendance
at
church
three
time
a
day
,
have
utterly
defeat
many
malicious
attack
on
her
own
reputation
;
for
such
be
the
envy
that
Lindamira
's
virtue
have
attract
,
that
,
notwithstanding
her
own
strict
behaviour
and
strict
enquiry
into
the
life
of
other
,
she
have
not
be
able
to
escape
be
the
mark
of
some
arrow
herself
,
which
,
however
,
do
her
no
injury
;
a
blessing
,
perhaps
,
owe
by
her
to
the
clergy
,
who
be
her
chief
male
companion
,
and
with
two
or
three
of
whom
she
have
be
barbarously
and
unjustly
calumniate
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
so
unjustly
neither
,
perhaps
,
"
say
Slipslop
;
"
for
the
clergy
be
man
,
as
well
as
other
folk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
extreme
delicacy
of
Lindamira
's
virtue
be
cruelly
hurt
by
those
freedom
which
Leonora
allow
herself
:
she
say
,
"
It
be
an
affront
to
her
sex
;
that
she
do
not
imagine
it
consistent
with
any
woman
's
honour
to
speak
to
the
creature
,
or

be
see
in
her
company
;
and
that
,
for
her
part
,
she
should
always
refuse
to
dance
at
an
assembly
with
her
,
for
fear
of
contamination
by
take
her
by
the
hand
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
my
story
:
as
soon
as
Bellarmine
be
recover
,
which
be
somewhat
within
a
month
from
his
receive
the
wound
,
he
set
out
,
accord
to
agreement
,
for
Leonora
's
father
's
,
in
order
to
propose
the
match
,
and
settle
all
matter
with
him
touching
settlement
,
and
the
like
.
  
<EOS>
a
little
before
his
arrival
the
old
gentleman
have
receive
an
intimation
of
the
affair
by
the
follow
letter
,
which
I
can
repeat
verbatim
,
and
which
,
they
say
,
be
write
neither
by
Leonora
nor
her
aunt
,
though
it
be
in
a
woman
's
hand
.
<EOS>
the
letter
be
in
these
word
:
    
"
SIR
,
 
I
be
sorry
to
acquaint
you
that
your
daughter
,
Leonora
,
hath
act
one
of
the
basest
as
well
as
most
simple
part
with
a
young
gentleman
to
whom
she
have
engage
herself
,
and
whom
she
hath
(
pardon
the
word
)
<EOS>
jilt
for
another
of
inferior
fortune
,
notwithstanding
his
superior
figure
.
<EOS>
You
may
take
what
measure
you
please
on
this
occasion
;
I
have
perform
what
I
think
my
duty
;
as
I
have
,
though
unknown
to
you
,
a
very
great
respect
for
your
family
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
do
not
give
himself
the
trouble
to
answer
this
kind
epistle
;
nor
do
he
take
any
notice
of
it
,
after
he
have
read
it
,
till
he
see
Bellarmine
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
to
say
the
truth
,
one
of
those
father
who
look
on
child
as
an
unhappy
consequence
of
their
youthful
pleasure
;
which
,
as
he
would
have
be
delight
not
to
have
have
attend
them
,
so
be
he
no
less
pleased
with
any
opportunity
to
rid
himself
of
the
incumbrance
.
<EOS>
He
pass
,
in
the
world
's
language
,
as
an
exceed
good
father
;
be
not
only
so
rapacious
as
to
rob
and
plunder
all
mankind
to
the
utmost
of
his
power
,
but
even
to
deny
himself
the
conveniencie
,
and
almost
necessary
,
of
life
;
which
his
neighbour
attribute
to
a
desire
of
raise
immense
fortune
for
his
child
:
<EOS>
but
in
fact
it
be
not
so
;
he
heap
up
money
for
its
own
sake
only
,
and
look
on
his
child
as
his
rival
,
who
be
to
enjoy
his
beloved
mistress
when
he
be
incapable
of
possess
her
,
and
which
he
would
have
be
much
more
charm
with
the
power
of
carry
along
with
him
;
nor
have
his
child
any
other
security
of
be
his
heir
than
that
the
law
would
constitute
them
such
without
a
will
,
and
that
he
have
not
affection
enough
for
any
one
live
to
take
the
trouble
of
write
one
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
gentleman
come
Bellarmine
,
on
the
errand
I
have
mention
.
<EOS>
His
person
,
his
equipage
,
his
family
,
and
his
estate
,
seem
to
the
father
to
make
him
an
advantageous
match
for
his
daughter
:
he
therefore
very
readily
accept
his
proposal
:
but
when
Bellarmine
imagine
the
principal
affair
conclude
,
and
begin
to
open
the
incidental
matter
of
fortune
,
the
old
gentleman
presently
change
his
countenance
,
say
,
"
He
resolve
never
to
marry
his
daughter
on
a
Smithfield
match
;
<EOS>
that
whoever
have
love
for
her
to
take
her
would
,
when
he
die
,
find
her
share
of
his
fortune
in
his
coffer
;
but
he
have
see
such
example
of
undutifulness
happen
from
the
too
early
generosity
of
parent
,
that
he
have
make
a
vow
never
to
part
with
a
shilling
whilst
he
live
.
"
<EOS>
He
commend
the
saying
of
Solomon
,
"
He
that
spareth
the
rod
spoileth
the
child
;
"
but
add
,
"
he
may
have
likewise
assert
,
that
he
that
spareth
the
purse
saveth
the
child
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
run
into
a
discourse
on
the
extravagance
of
the
youth
of
the
age
;
whence
he
launch
into
a
dissertation
on
horse
;
and
come
at
length
to
commend
those
Bellarmine
drive
.
<EOS>
that
fine
gentleman
,
who
at
another
season
would
have
be
well
enough
pleased
to
dwell
a
little
on
that
subject
,
be
now
very
eager
to
resume
the
circumstance
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
He
have
a
very
high
value
for
the
young
lady
,
and
would
receive
her
with
less
than
he
would
<EOS>
any
other
whatever
;
but
that
even
his
love
to
her
make
some
regard
to
worldly
matter
necessary
;
for
it
would
be
a
most
distracting
sight
for
him
to
see
her
,
when
he
have
the
honour
to
be
her
husband
,
in
less
than
a
coach
and
six
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
answer
,
"
four
will
do
,
four
will
do
;
"
and
then
take
a
turn
from
horse
to
extravagance
and
from
extravagance
to
horse
,
till
he
come
round
to
the
equipage
again
;
whither
he
be
no
sooner
arrive
than
Bellarmine
bring
him
back
to
the
point
;
but
all
to
no
purpose
;
he
make
his
escape
from
that
subject
in
a
minute
;
till
at
last
the
lover
declare
,
"
that
in
the
present
situation
of
his
affair
it
be
impossible
for
him
,
though
he
love
Leonora
more
than
tout
le
monde
,
to
marry
her
without
any
fortune
.
"
<EOS>
to
which
the
father
answer
,
"
He
be
sorry
that
his
daughter
must
lose
so
valuable
a
match
;
that
,
if
he
have
an
inclination
,
at
present
it
be
not
in
his
power
to
advance
a
shilling
:
that
he
have
have
great
loss
,
and
be
at
great
expense
on
project
;
which
,
though
he
have
great
expectation
from
them
,
have
yet
produce
him
nothing
:
that
he
do
not
know
what
may
happen
hereafter
,
as
on
the
birth
of
a
son
,
or
such
accident
;
but
he
would
make
no
promise
,
or
enter
into
any
article
,
for
he
would
not
break
his
vow
for
all
the
daughter
in
the
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
lady
,
to
keep
you
no
longer
in
suspense
,
Bellarmine
,
have
try
every
argument
and
persuasion
which
he
could
invent
,
and
find
them
all
ineffectual
,
at
length
take
his
leave
,
but
not
in
order
to
return
to
Leonora
;
he
proceed
directly
to
his
own
seat
,
whence
,
after
a
few
day
'
stay
,
he
return
to
Paris
,
to
the
great
delight
of
the
French
and
the
honour
of
the
english
nation
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
soon
as
he
arrive
at
his
home
he
presently
despatch
a
messenger
with
the
follow
epistle
to
Leonora
:
    
"
ADORABLE
and
CHARMANTE
,
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
have
the
honour
to
tell
you
I
be
not
the
heureux

for
your
divine
arm

<EOS>
Your
papa
hath
tell
me
so
with
a
politesse
not
often
see
on
this
side
Paris
.
<EOS>
You
may
perhaps
guess
his
manner
of
refuse
me
.
<EOS>
ah
,
mon
dieu
!
<EOS>
You
will
certainly
believe
me
,
madam
,
incapable
myself
of
deliver
this
triste
message
,
which
I
intend
to
try
the
french
air
to
cure
the
consequence

if
your

oblige
you
to

I
hope
we
shall
see
you
at
Paris

till
when
,
the
wind
that
flow
from
thence
will
be

warm

"
BELLARMINE

<EOS>
I
shall
not
attempt
,
lady
,
to
describe
Leonora
's
condition
when
she
receive
this
letter
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
picture
of
horror
,
which
I
should
have
as
little
pleasure
in
draw
as
you
in
behold
.
<EOS>
She
immediately
leave
the
place
where
she
be
the
subject
of
conversation
and
ridicule
,
and
retire
to
that
house
<EOS>
I
show
you
when
I
begin
the
story
;
where
she
hath
ever
since
lead
a
disconsolate
life
,
and
deserve
,
perhaps
,
pity
for
her
misfortune
,
more
than
our
censure
for
a
behaviour
to
which
the
artifice
of
her
aunt
very
probably
contribute
,
and
to
which
very
young
woman
be
often
render
too
liable
by
that
blameable
levity
in
the
education
of
our
sex
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
be
incline
to
pity
her
,
"
say
a
young
lady
in
the
coach
,
"
it
would
be
for
the
loss
of
Horatio
;
for
I
can
not
discern
any
misfortune
in
her
miss
such
a
husband
as
Bellarmine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
must
own
,
"
say
Slipslop
,
"
the
gentleman
be
a
little
false
-
hearted
;
but
howsumever
,
it
be
hard
to
have
two
lover

get
never
a
husband
at
all

but
pray
,
madam
,
what
become
of
Our

<EOS>
He
remain
,
say
the
lady
,
still
unmarried
,
and
hath
apply
himself
so
strictly
to
his
business
,
that
he
hath
raise
,
I
hear
,
a
very
considerable
fortune
.
<EOS>
and
what
be
remarkable
,
they
say
he
never
hear
the
name
of
Leonora
without
a
sigh
,
nor
hath
ever
utter
one
syllable
to
charge
her
with
her
ill

conduct
towards
him

<EOS>
a
very
short
chapter
,
in
which
parson
Adams
go
a
great
way
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
,
have
finish
her
story
,
receive
the
thank
of

now
Joseph

put
his
head
out

cry
out

never

me

yonder
be
not

Adams
walk
along

"
on
my
word
,

so
he
be
,
"
say
slipslop
:
"
and
as
sure
as
twopence
<EOS>
he
hath
leave
him
behind
at
the
inn
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
true
it
be
,
the
parson
have
exhibit
a
fresh
instance
of
his
absence
of
mind
;
for
he
be
so
pleased
with
have
get
Joseph
into
the
coach
,
that
he
never
once
think
of
the
beast
in
the
stable
;
and
,
find
his
leg
as
nimble
as
he
desire
,
he
sally
out
,
brandish
a
crabstick
,
and
have
keep
on
before
the
coach
,
mend
and
slacken
his
pace
occasionally
,
so
that
he
have
never
be
much
more
or
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Slipslop
desire
the
coachman
to
overtake
him
,
which
he
attempt
,
but
in
vain
;
for
the
faster
he
drive
the
faster
run
the
parson
,
often
cry
out
,
<EOS>
"
aye
,
aye
,
catch
me
if
you
can
;
"
till
at
length
the
coachman
swore
he
would
as
soon
attempt
to
drive
after
a
greyhound
,
and
,
give
the
parson
two
or
three
hearty
curse
,
he
cry'd
,
"
softly
,
softly
,
boy
,
"
to
his
horse
,
which
the
civil
beast
immediately
obey
.
  
<EOS>
but
we
will
be
more
courteous
to
our
reader
than
he
be
to
Mrs
Slipslop
;
and
,
leave
the
coach
and
its
company
to
pursue
their
journey
,
we
will
carry
our
reader
on
after
parson
Adams
,
who
stretch
forwards
without
once
look
behind
him
,
till
,
have
leave
the
coach
full
three
mile
in
his
rear
,
he
come
to
a
place
where
,
by
keep
the
extreme
track
to
the
right
,
it
be
just
barely
possible
for
a
human
creature
to
miss
his
way
.
<EOS>
this
track
,
however

do
he
keep
,
as
indeed
he
have
a
wonderful
capacity
at
these
kind
of
bare
possibility
,
and
,
travel
in
it
about
three
mile
over
the
plain
,
he
arrive
at
the
summit
of
a
hill
,
whence
look
a
great
way
backwards
,
and
perceive
no
coach
in
sight
,
he
sit
himself
down
on
the
turf
,
and
,
pull
out
his
Aeschylus
,
determine
to
wait
here
for
its
arrival
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
not
sit
long
here
before
a
gun
go
off
very
near
,
a
little
startled
him
;
he
look
up
and
see
a
gentleman
within
a
hundred
pace
take
up
a
partridge
which
he
have
just
shoot
.
  
<EOS>
Adams
stand
up
and
present
a
figure
to
the
gentleman
which
would
have
move
laughter
in
many
;
for
his
cassock
have
just
again
fall
down
below
his
greatcoat
,
that
be
to
say
,
it
reach
his
knee
,
whereas
the
skirt
of
his
greatcoat
descend
no
low
than
half
-
way
down
his
thigh
;
but
the
gentleman
's
mirth
give
way
to
his
surprize
at
behold
such
a
personage
in
such
a
place
.
  
<EOS>
Adams
,
advance
to
the
gentleman
,
tell
him
he
hope
he
have
good
sport
,
to
which
the
other
answer
,
"
very
little
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
,
sir
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
you
have
smite
one
partridge
;
"
to
which
the
sportsman
make
no
reply
,
but
proceed
to
charge
his
piece
.
  
<EOS>
whilst
the
gun
be
charge
,
Adams
remain
in
silence
,
which
he
at
last
break
by
observe
that
it
be
a
delightful
evening
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
,
who
have
at
first
sight
conceive
a
very
distasteful
opinion
of
the
parson
,
begin
,
on
perceive
a
book
in
his
hand
and
smoaking
likewise
the
information
of
the
cassock
,
to
change
his
thought
,
and
make
a
small
advance
to
conversation
on
his
side
by
say
,
"
Sir
,
I
suppose
you
be
not
one
of
these
part
?
"
  
<EOS>
Adams
immediately
tell
him
,
"
no
;
that
he
be
a
traveller
,
and
invite
by
the
beauty
of
the
evening
and
the
place
to
repose
a
little
and
amuse
himself
with
reading
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
may
as
well
repose
myself
too
,
"
say
the
sportsman
,
"
<EOS>
for
I
have
be
out
this
whole
afternoon
,
and
the
devil
a
bird
<EOS>
have
I
see
till
I
come
hither
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
then
the
game
be
not
very
plenty
hereabouts
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Adams
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
sir
,
"
say
the
gentleman
:
"
the
soldier
,
who
be
quarter
in
the
neighbourhood
,
have
kill
it
all
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
probable
,
"
cry
Adams
,
"
for
shooting
be
their
profession
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
shoot
the
game
,
"
answer
the
other
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
see
they
be
so
forward
to
shoot
our
enemy
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
that
affair
of
Carthagena
;
if
I
have
be
there
,
I
believe
I
should
have
do
other
-
guess
thing
,
<EOS>
d####n
me
:
<EOS>
what
be
a
man
's
life
when
his
country
demand
it
?
<EOS>
a
man
who
will
not
sacrifice
his
life
for
his
country
deserve
to
be
hang
,
d####n
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
which
word
he
speak
with
so
violent
a
gesture
,
<EOS>
so
loud
a
voice
,
so
strong
an
accent
,
and
so
fierce
a
countenance
,
that
he
may
have
frighten
a
captain
of
train
band
at
the
head
of
his
company
;
but
Mr
Adams
be
not
greatly
subject
to
fear
;
he
tell
him
intrepidly
that
he
very
much
approve
his
virtue
,
but
dislike
his
swearing
,
and
beg
him
not
to
addict
himself
to
so
bad
a
custom
,
without
which
he
say
he
may
fight
as
bravely
as
achille
do
.
<EOS>
indeed
he
be
charm
with
this
discourse
;
he
tell
the
gentleman
he
would
willingly
have
go
many
mile
to
have
meet
a
man
of
his
generous
way
of
thinking
;
that
,
if
he
please
to
sit
down
,
he
should
be
greatly
delighted
to
commune
with
him
;
for
,
though
he
be
a
clergyman
,
he
would
himself
be
ready
,
if
thereto
call
,
to
lay
down
his
life
for
his
country
.
  
<EOS>
the
gentleman
sit
down
,
and
Adams
by
him
;
and
then
the
latter
begin
,
as
in
the
follow
chapter
,
a
discourse
which
we
have
place
by
itself
,
as
it
be
not
only
the
most
curious
in
this
<EOS>
but
perhaps
in
any
other
book
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
a
notable
dissertation
by
Mr
Abraham
Adams
;
wherein
that
gentleman
appear
in
a
political
light
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
assure
you
,
sir
"
(
say
he
,
take
the
gentleman
by
the
hand
)
,
"
I
be
heartily
glad
to
meet
with
a
man
of
your
kidney
;
for
,
though
I
be
a
poor
parson
,
I
will
be
bold
to
say
I
be
an
honest
man
,
and
would
not
do
an
ill
thing
to
be
make
a
bishop
;
nay
,
though
it
hath
not
fall
in
my
way
to
offer
so
noble
a
sacrifice
,
I
have
not
be
without
opportunity
of
suffer
for
the
sake
of
my
conscience
,
I
thank
Heaven
for
them
;
for
I
have
have
relation
,
though
I
say
it
,
who
make
some
figure
in
the
world
;
particularly
a
nephew
,
who
be
a
shopkeeper
and
an
alderman
of
a
corporation
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
good
lad
,
and
be
under
my
care
when
a
boy
;
and
I
believe
would
do
what
I
bade
him
to
his
die
day
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
look
like
extreme
vanity
in
me
to
affect
be
a
man
of
such
consequence
as
to
have
so
great
an
interest
in
an
alderman
;
but
other
have
think
so
too
,
as
manifestly
appear
by
the
rector
,
whose
curate
I
formerly
be
,
send
for
me
on
the
approach
of
an
election
,
and
tell
me
,
if
I
expect
to
continue
in
his
cure
,
that
I
must
bring
my
nephew
to
vote
for
one
Colonel
courtly
,
a
gentleman
whom
I
have
never
hear
tiding
of
till
that
instant
.
<EOS>
I
tell
the
rector
<EOS>
I
have
no
power
over
my
nephew
's
vote
<EOS>
(
God
forgive
me
for
such
prevarication
!
)
;
that
I
suppose
he
would
give
it
accord
to
his
conscience
;
that
I
would
by
no
means
endeavour
to
influence
him
to
give
it
otherwise
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
it
be
in
vain
to
equivocate
;
that
he
know
I
have
already
speak
to
him
in
favour
of
esquire
Fickle
,
my
neighbour
;
and
,
indeed
,
it
be
true
I
have
;
for
it
be
at
a
season
when
the
church
be
in
danger
,
and
when
all
good
man
expect
they
know
not
what
would
happen
to
us
all
.
<EOS>
I
then
answer
boldly
,
if
he
think
I
have
give
my
promise
,
he
affront
me
in
propose
any
breach
of
it
.
<EOS>
not
to
be
too
prolix
;
I
persevere
,
and
so
do
my
nephew
,
in
the
esquire
's
interest
,
who
be
choose
chiefly
through
his
mean
;
and
so
I
lose
my
curacy
,
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
but
do
you
think
the
esquire
ever
mention
a
word
of
the
church
?
<EOS>
Ne
verbum
quidem
,
ut
<EOS>
ita
dicam
:
within
two
year
he
get
a
place
,
and
hath
ever
since
live
in
London
;
where
I
have
be
inform
(
but
God
forbid
<EOS>
I
should
believe
that
,
)
<EOS>
that
he
never
so
much
as
goeth
to
church
.
<EOS>
I
remain
,
sir
,
a
considerable
time
without
any
cure
,
and
live
a
full
month
on
one
funeral
sermon
,
which
I
preach
on
the
indisposition
of
a
clergyman
;
but
this
by
the
bye
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
when
Mr
Fickle
get
his
place
,
Colonel
courtly
stand
again
;
and
who
should
make
interest
for
him
but
Mr
Fickle
himself
!
<EOS>
that
very
identical
Mr
Fickle
,
who
have
formerly
tell
me
the
colonel
be
an
enemy
to
both
the
church
and
state
,
have
the
confidence
to
sollicit
my
nephew
for
him
;
and
the
colonel
himself
offer
me
to
make
me
chaplain
to
his
regiment
,
which
I
refuse
in
favour
of
Sir
Oliver
Hearty
,
who
tell
us
he
would
sacrifice
everything
to
his
country
;
and
I
believe
he
would
,
except
his
hunting
,
which
he
stick
so
close
to
,
that
in
five
year
together
he
go
but
twice
up
to
parliament
;
and
one
of
those
time
,
I
have
be
tell
,
never
be
within
sight
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
be
a
worthy
man
,
and
the
good
friend
I
ever
have
;
for
,
by
his
interest
with
a
bishop
,
he
get
me
replace
into
my
curacy
,
and
give
me
eight
pound
out
of
his
own
pocket
to
buy
me
a
gown
and
cassock
,
and
furnish
my
house
.
<EOS>
He
have
our
interest
while
he
live
,
which
be
not
many
year
.
<EOS>
on
his
death
I
have
fresh
application
make
to
me
;
for
all
the
world
know
the
interest
I
have
with
my
good
nephew
,
who
now
be
a
leading
man
in
the
corporation
;
and
Sir
Thomas
Booby
,
buy
the
estate
which
have
be
Sir
Oliver
's
,
propose
himself
a
candidate
.
<EOS>
He
be
then
<EOS>
a
young
gentleman
just
come
from
his
travel
;
and
it
do
me
good
to
hear
him
discourse
on
affair
which
,
for
my
part
,
I
know
nothing
of
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
master
of
a
thousand
vote
he
should
have
have
them
all
.
<EOS>
I
engage
my
nephew
in
his
interest
,
and
he
be
elect
;
and
a
very
fine
parliament
-
man
he
be
.
<EOS>
They
tell
me
he
make
speech
of
an
hour
long
,
and
,
I
have
be
tell
,
very
fine
one
;
but
he
could
never
persuade
the
parliament
to
be
of
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
Non
omnia
possumus
omne
.
<EOS>
He
promise
me
a
live
,
poor
man
!
<EOS>
and
I
believe
I
should
have
have
it
,
but
an
accident
happen
,
which
be
,
that
my
lady
have
promise
it
before
,
unknown
to
him
.
<EOS>
this
,
indeed
,
I
never
hear
till
afterwards
;
for
my
nephew
,
who
die
about
a
month
before
the
incumbent
,
always
tell
me
I
may
be
assure
of
it
.
<EOS>
since
that
time
,
Sir
Thomas
,
poor
man
,
have
always
so
much
business
,
that
he
never
could
find
leisure
to
see
me
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
be
partly
my
lady
's
fault
too
,
<EOS>
who
do
not
think
my
dress
good
enough
for
the
gentry
at
her
table
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
must
do
him
the
justice
to
say
he
never
be
ungrateful
;
and
I
have
always
find
his
kitchen
,
and
his
cellar
too
,
open
to
me
:
<EOS>
many
a
time
,
after
service
on
a
Sunday
 
for
I
preach
at
four
church
 
<EOS>
have
I
recruit
my
spirit
with
a
glass
of
his
ale
.
<EOS>
since
my
nephew
's
death
,
the
corporation
be
in
other
hand
;
and
I
be
not
a
man
of
that
consequence
<EOS>
I
be
formerly
.
<EOS>
I
have
now
no
longer
any
talent
to
lay
out
in
the
service
of
my
country
;
and
to
whom
nothing
be
give
,
of
him
can
nothing
be
require
.
<EOS>
however
,
on
all
proper
season
,
such
as
the
approach
of
an
election
,
I
throw
a
suitable
dash
or
two
into
my
sermon
;
which
I
have
the
pleasure
to
hear
be
not
disagreeable
to
Sir
Thomas
and
the
other
honest
gentleman
<EOS>
my
neighbour
,
who
have
all
promise
me
these
five
year
to
procure
an
ordination
for
a
son
of
mine
,
who
be
now
near
thirty
,
hath
an
infinite
stock
of
learning
,
and
be
,
I
thank
Heaven
,
of
an
unexceptionable
life
;
though
,
as
he
be
never
at
an
university
,
the
bishop
refuse
to
ordain
him
.
<EOS>
too
much
care
can
not
indeed
be
take
in
admit
any
to
the
sacred
office
;
though
I
hope
he
will
never
act
so
as
to
be
a
disgrace
to
any
order
,
but
will
serve
his
God
and
his
country
to
the
utmost
of
his
power
,
as
I
have
endeavour
to
do
before
him
;
nay
,
and
will
lay
down
his
life
whenever
call
to
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
have
educate
him
in
those
principle
;
so
that
I
have
acquit
my
duty
,
and
shall
have
nothing
to
answer
for
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
distrust
him
,
for
he
be
a
good
boy
;
and
if
Providence
should
throw
it
in
his
way
to
be
of
as
much
consequence
in
a
public
light
as
his
father
once
be
,
I
can
answer
for
him
he
will
use
his
talent
as
honestly
as
I
have
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
.
  
<EOS>
in
which
the
gentleman
discant
on
bravery
and
heroic
virtue
,
till
an
unlucky
accident
put
an
end
to
the
discourse
.
  
<EOS>
the
gentleman
highly
commend
Mr
Adams
for
his
good
resolution
,
and
tell
him
,
"
He
hope
his
son
would
tread
in
his
step
;
<EOS>
"
add
,
"
that
if
he
would
not
die
for
his
country
,
he
would
not
be
worthy
to
live
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
would
make
no
more
of
shoot
a
man
that
would
not
die
for
his
country
,
than
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
have
disinherit
a
nephew
,
who
be
in
the
army
,
because
he
would
not
exchange
his
commission
and
go
to
the
West
Indies
.
<EOS>
I
believe
the
rascal
be
a
coward
,
though
he
pretend
to
be
in
love
forsooth
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
all
such
fellow
hang
,
sir
;
I
would
have
them
hang
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Adams
answer
,
"
that
would
be
too
severe
;
that
man
do
not
make
themselves
;
and
if
fear
have
too
much
ascendance
in
the
mind
,
the
man
be
rather
to
be
pity
than
abhor
;
that
reason
and
time
may
teach
him
to
subdue
it
.
"
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
a
man
may
be
a
coward
at
one
time
,
and
brave
at
another
.
<EOS>
Homer
,
"
say
he
,
"
who
so
well
understand
and
copy
Nature
,
hath
teach
us
this
lesson
;
for
Paris
fight
and
Hector
run
away
.
<EOS>
nay
,
we
have
a
mighty
instance
of
this
in
the
history
of
later
age
,
no
longer
ago
than
the
705th
year
of
Rome
,
when
the
great
Pompey
,
who
have
win
so
many
battle
and
be
honour
with
so
many
triumph
,
and
of
whose
valour
several
author
,
especially
Cicero
and
Paterculus
,
have
form
such
elogium
;
this
very
Pompey
leave
the
battle
of
Pharsalia
before
he
have
lose
it
,
and
retreat
to
his
tent
,
where
he
sit
like
the
most
pusillanimous
rascal
in
a
fit
of
despair
,
and
yield
a
victory
,
which
be
to
determine
the
empire
of
the
world
,
to
Caesar
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
much
travel
in
the
history
of
modern
time
,
that
be
to
say
,
these
last
thousand
year
;
but
those
who
be
can
,
I
make
no
question
,
furnish
you
with
parallel
instance
.
"
<EOS>
He
conclude
,
therefore
,
that
,
have
he
take
any
such
hasty
resolution
against
his
nephew
,
he
hope
he
would
consider
better
,
and
retract
them
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
answer
with
great
warmth
,
and
talk
much
of
courage
and
his
country
,
till
,
perceive
it
grow
late
,
he
ask
Adams
,
"
what
place
he
intend
for
that
night
?
"
<EOS>
He
tell
him
,
"
He
wait
there
for
the
stage
-
coach
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
stage
-
coach
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
gentleman
;
"
they
be
all
pass
by
long
ago
.
<EOS>
You
may
see
the
last
yourself
almost
three
mile
before
us
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
protest
and
so
they
be
,
"
cry
Adams
;
"
then
I
must
make
haste
and
follow
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
gentleman
tell
him
,
"
he
would
hardly
be
able
to
overtake
them
;
and
that
,
if
he
do
not
know
his
way
,
he
would
be
in
danger
of
lose
himself
on
the
down
,
for
it
would
be
presently
dark
;
and
he
may
ramble
about
all
night
,
and
perhaps
find
himself
farther
from
his
journey
's
end
in
the
morning
than
he
be
now
.
"
<EOS>
He
advise
him
,
therefore
,
"
to
accompany
him
to
his
house
,
which
be
very
little
out
of
his
way
,
"
assure
him
"
that
he
would
find
some
country
fellow
in
his
parish
who
would
conduct
him
for
sixpence
to
the
city
where
he
be
go
.
"
<EOS>
Adams
accept
this
proposal
,
and
on
they
travel
,
the
gentleman
renew
his
discourse
on
courage
,
and
the
infamy
of
not
be
ready
,
at
all
time
,
to
sacrifice
our
life
to
our
country
.
<EOS>
night
overtook
them
much
about
the
same
time
as
they
arrive
near
some
bush
;
whence
,
on
a
sudden
,
they
hear
the
most
violent
shriek
imaginable
in
a
female
voice
.
<EOS>
Adams
offer
to
snatch
the
gun
out
of
his
companion
's
hand
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
do
?
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
!
"
<EOS>

Adams
;

"
I
be
hasten
to
the
assistance
of
the
poor
creature
whom
some
villain
be
murder

"
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
mad
enough

I
hope

"
say
the
gentleman
,
tremble
:

do
you
consider
this

charge
with
shot

that

robber
be

pistol
load
with

<EOS>
this
be
no
business
of
our
;
let
us
make
as
much
haste
as
possible
out
of
the
way
,
or
we
may
fall
into
their
hand
ourselves

"
<EOS>
the
shriek
now
increase
,
Adams
make
no
answer
,
but
snapt
his
finger
,
and
,
brandish
his
crabstick
,
make
directly
to
the
place
<EOS>
whence
the
voice
issue
;
and
the
man
of
courage
make
as
much
expedition
towards
his
own
home
<EOS>
,
whither
he
escape
in
a
very
short
time
without
once
look
behind
him
;
where
we
will
leave
him
,
to
contemplate
his
own
bravery
,
and
to
censure
the
want
of
it
in
other
,
and
return
to
the
good
Adams
,
who
,
on
come
up
to
the
place
<EOS>
whence
the
noise
proceed
,
find
a
woman
struggle
with
a
man
,
who
have
throw
her
on
the
ground
,
and
have
almost
overpower
her
.
<EOS>
the
great
ability
of
Mr
Adams
be
not
necessary
to
have
form
a
right
judgment
of
this
affair
on
the
first
sight
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
,
therefore
,
want
the
entreaty
of
the
poor
wretch
to
assist
her
;
but
,
lift
up
his
crabstick
,
he
immediately
level
a
blow
at
that
part
of
the
ravisher
's
head
where
,
accord
to
the
opinion
of
the
ancient
,
the
brain
of
some
person
be
deposit
,
and
which
he
have
undoubtedly
let
forth
,
have
not
Nature
(
who
,
as
wise
man
have
observe
,
equip
all
creature
with
what
be
most
expedient
for
them
)
take
a
provident
care
(
as
she
always
doth
with
those
she
intend
for
encounter
)
to
make
this
part
of
the
head
three
time
as
thick
as
those
of
ordinary
man
who
be
design
to
exercise
talent
which
be
vulgarly
call
rational
,
and
for
whom
,
as
brain
be
necessary
,
she
be
oblige
to
leave
some
room
for
them
in
the
cavity
of
the
skull
;
whereas
,
those
ingredient
be
entirely
useless
to
person
of
the
heroic
calling
,
she
hath
an
opportunity
of
thicken
the
bone
,
so
as
to
make
it
less
subject
to
any
impression
,
or
liable
to
be
crack
or
break
:
and
indeed
,
in
some
who
be
predestine
to
the
command
of
army
and
empire
,
she
be
suppose
sometimes
to
make
that
part
perfectly
solid
.
  
<EOS>
as
a
game
cock
,
when
engage
in
amorous
toying
with
a
hen
,
if
perchance
he
espy
another
cock
at
hand
,
immediately
quit
his
female
,
and
oppose
himself
to
his
rival
,
so
do
the
ravish
,
on
the
information
of
the
crabstick
,
immediately
leap
from
the
woman
and
hasten
to
assail
the
man
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
weapon
but
what
Nature
have
furnish
him
with
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
clench
his
fist
,
and
presently
dart
it
at
that
part
of
Adams
's
breast
where
the
heart
be
lodge
.
<EOS>
Adams
stagger
at
the
violence
of
the
blow
,
when
,
throw
away
his
staff
,
he
likewise
clench
that
fist
which
we
have
before
commemorate
,
and
would
have
discharge
it
full
in
the
breast
of
his
antagonist
,
have
he
not
dexterously
catch
it
with
his
left
hand
,
at
the
same
time
dart
his
head
(
which
some
modern
hero
of
the
low
class
use
,
like
the
battering
-
ram
of
the
ancient
,
for
a
weapon
of
offence
;
another
reason
to
admire
the
cunningness
of
Nature
,
in
compose
it
of
those
impenetrable
material
)
;
dash
his
head
,
I
say
,
into
the
stomach
of
Adams
,
he
tumble
him
on
his
back
;
and
,
not
have
any
regard
to
the
law
of
heroism
,
which
would
have
restrain
him
from
any
farther
attack
on
his
enemy
till
he
be
again
on
his
leg
,
he
throw
himself
upon
him
,
and
,
lay
hold
on
the
ground
with
his
left
hand
,
<EOS>
he
with
his
right
belabour
the
body
of
Adams
till
he
be
weary
,
and
indeed
till
he
conclude
(
to
use
the
language
of
fighting
)
"
that
he
have
do
his
business
;
"
or
,
in
the
language
of
poetry
,
"
that
he
have
send
him
to
the
shade
below
;
"
in
plain
English
,
"
that
he
be
dead
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
Adams
,
who
be
no
chicken
,
and
could
bear
a
drubbing
as
well
as
any
box
champion
in
the
universe
,
lie
still
only
to
watch
his
opportunity
;
and
now
,
perceive
his
antagonist
to
pant
with
his
labour
,
he
exert
his
utmost
force
at
once
,
and
with
such
success
that
he
overturn
him
,
and
become
his
superior
;
when
,
fix
one
of
his
knee
in
his
breast
,
he
cry
out
in
an
exulting
voice
,
"
<EOS>
It
be
my
turn
now
;
"
and
,
after
a
few
minute
'
constant
application
,
he
give
him
so
dexterous
<EOS>
a
blow
just
under
his
chin
that
the
fellow
no
longer
retain
any
motion
,
and
Adams
begin
to
fear
he
have
strike
him
once
too
often
;
for
he
often
assert
"
he
should
be
concern
to
have
the
blood
of
even
the
wicked
upon
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adams
get
up
and
call
aloud
to
the
young
woman
.
<EOS>
"
be
of
good
cheer
,
damsel
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
be
no
longer
in
danger
of
your
ravisher
,
who
,
I
be
terribly
afraid
,
lie
dead
at
my
foot
;
but
God
forgive
me
what
I
have
do
in
defence
of
innocence
!
"
<EOS>
the
poor
wretch
,
who
have
be
some
time
in
recover
strength
enough
to
rise
,
and
have
afterwards
,
during
the
engagement
,
stand
tremble
,
be
disable
by
fear
even
from
run
away
,
hear
her
champion
be
victorious
,
come
up
to
him
,
but
not
without
apprehension
even
of
her
deliverer
;
which
,
however
,
she
be
soon
relieve
from
by
his
courteous
behaviour
and
gentle
word
.
<EOS>
They
be
both
stand
by
the
body
,
which
lie
motionless
on
the
ground
,
and
which
Adams
wish
to
see
stir
much
more
than
the
woman
do
,
when
he
earnestly
beg
her
to
tell
him
"
by
what
misfortune
<EOS>
she
come
,
at
such
a
time
of
night
,
into
so
lonely
a
place

<EOS>
She
acquaint
him
,
"
She
be
travel
towards
London
,
and
have
accidentally
meet
with
the
person
from
whom
he
have
deliver
her
,
who
tell
her
he
be
likewise
on
his
journey
to
the
same
place
,
and
would
keep
her
company
;
an
offer
which
,
suspect
no
harm
,
she
have
accept
;
that
he
tell
her
they
be
at
a
small
distance
from
an
inn
where
she
may
take
up
her
lodging
that
evening
,
and
he
would
show
her
a
nearer
way
to
it
than
by
follow
the
road
;
that
if
she
have
suspect
him
(
which
she
do
not
,
he
speak
so
kindly
to
her
)
,
be
alone
on
these
down
in
the
dark
<EOS>
,
she
have
no
human
mean
to
avoid
him
;
that
,
therefore
,
she
put
her
whole
trust
in
Providence
,
and
walk
on
,
expect
every
moment
to
arrive
at
the
inn
;
when
on
a
sudden
,
be
come
to
those
bush
,
he
desire
her
to
stop
,
and
after
some
rude
kiss
,
which
she
resist
,
and
some
entreaty
,
which
she
reject
,
he
lay
violent
hand
on
her
,
and
be
attempt
to
execute
his
wicked
will
,
when
,
she
thank
g

,
he
timely
come
up
and
prevent
him
.
"
<EOS>
Adams
encourage
her
for
say
she
have
put
her
whole
trust
in
Providence
,
and
tell
her
,
"
He
doubt
not
but
Providence
have
send
him
to
her
deliverance
,
as
a
reward
for
that
trust
.
<EOS>
He
wish
indeed
he
have
not
deprive
the
wicked
wretch
of
life
,
but
g
"
s
will
be
do
;
"
say
,
"
He
hope
the
goodness
of
his
intention
would
excuse
him
in
the
next
world
,
and
he
trust
in
her
evidence
to
acquit
him
in
this
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
then
silent
,
and
begin
to
consider
with
himself
whether
it
would
be
properer
to
make
his
escape
,
or
to
deliver
himself
into
the
hand
of
justice
;
which
meditation
end
as
the
reader
will
see
in
the
next
chapter
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
give
an
account
of
the
strange
catastrophe
of
the
precede
adventure
,
which
draw
poor
Adams
into
fresh
calamity
;
and
who
the
woman
be
who
owe
the
preservation
of
her
chastity
to
his
victorious
arm
.
  
<EOS>
the
silence
of
Adams
,
add
to
the
darkness
of
the
night
and
loneliness
of
the
place
,
strike
dreadful
apprehension
into
the
poor
woman
's
mind
;
she
begin
to
fear
as
great
an
enemy
in
her
deliverer
as
he
have
deliver
her
from
;
and
as
she
have
not
light
enough
to
discover
the
age
of
Adams
,
and
the
benevolence
visible
in
his
countenance
,
she
suspect
he
have
use
her
as
some
very
honest
man
have
use
their
country
;
and
have
rescue
her
out
of
the
hand
of
one
rifler
in
order
to
rifle
her
himself
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
suspicion
she
draw
from
his
silence
;
but
indeed
they
be
ill
-
ground
.
<EOS>
He
stand
over
his
vanquished
enemy
,
wisely
weigh
in
his
mind
the
objection
which
may
be
make
to
either
of
the
two
method
of
proceeding
mention
in
the
last
chapter
,
his
judgment
sometimes
incline
to
the
one
,
and
sometimes
to
the
other
;
for
both
seem
to
him
so
equally
advisable
and
so
equally
dangerous
,
that
probably
he
would
have
end
his
day
,
at
least
two
or
three
of
them
,
on
that
very
spot
,
before
he
have
take
any
resolution
;
at
length
he
lift
up
his
eye
,
and
spy
a
light
at
a
distance
,
to
which
he
instantly
address
himself
with
Heus
tu
,
traveller
,
heus
tu
!
<EOS>
He
presently
hear
several
voice
,
and
perceive
the
light
approach
toward
him
.
<EOS>
the
person
who
attend
the
light
begin
some
to
laugh
,
other
to
sing
,
and
other
to
hollow
,
at
which
the
woman
testify
some
fear
(
for
she
have
conceal
her
suspicion
of
the
parson
himself
)
;
but
Adams
say
,
"
be
of
good
cheer
,
damsel
,
and
repose
thy
trust
in
the
same
Providence
which
hath
hitherto
protect
thee
,
and
never
will
forsake
the
innocent
.
"
<EOS>
these
people
,
who
now
approach
,
be
no
other
,
reader
,
than
a
set
of
young
fellow
,
who
come
to
these
bush
in
pursuit
of
a
diversion
which
they
call
bird
-
batting
.
<EOS>
this
,
if
you
be
ignorant
of
it
(
as
perhaps
if
thou
hast
never
travel
beyond
Kensington
,
Islington
,
Hackney
,
or
the
Borough
,
thou
mayst
be
)
,
I
will
inform
thee
,
be
perform
by
hold
a
large
clap
-
net
before
a
lanthorn
,
and
at
the
same
time
beat
the
bush
;
for
the
bird
,
when
they
be
disturb
from
their
place
of
rest
,
or
roost
,
immediately
make
to
the
light
,
and
so
be
intice
within
the
net
.
<EOS>
Adams
immediately
tell
them
what
happen
,
and
desire
them
to
hold
the
lanthorn
to
the
face
of
the
man
on
the
ground
,
for
he
fear
he
have
smote
him
fatally
.
<EOS>
but
indeed
his
fear
be
frivolous
;
for
the
fellow
,
though
he
have
be
stun
by
the
last
blow
he
receive
,
have
long
since
recover
his
sense
,
and
,
find
himself
quit
of
Adams
,
have
listen
attentively
to
the
discourse
between
him
and
the
young
woman
;
for
whose
departure
he
have
patiently
wait
,
that
he
may
likewise
withdraw
himself
,
have
no
longer
hope
of
succeed
in
his
desire
,
which
be
moreover
almost
as
well
cool
by
Mr
Adams
as
they
could
have
be
by
the
young
woman
herself
<EOS>
have
he
obtain
his
utmost
wish
.
<EOS>
this
fellow
,
who
have
a
readiness
at
improve
any
accident
,
think
he
may
now
play
a
well
part
than
that
of
a
dead
man
;
and
,
accordingly
,
the
moment
the
candle
be
hold
to
his
face
he
leapt
up
,
and
,
lay
hold
on
Adams
,
cry
out
,
"
no
,
villain
,
I
be
not
dead
,
though
you
and
your
wicked
whore
may
well
think
me
so
,
after
the
barbarous
cruelty
you
have
exercise
on
me

<EOS>
gentleman

say
he
,
"
you
be
luckily
come
to
the
assistance
of
a
poor
traveller
,
who
would
otherwise
have
be
rob
and
murder
by
this
vile
man
and
woman
,
who
lead
me
hither
out
of
my
way
from
the
high
-
road
,
and
both
fall
on
me
have
use
me
as
you
see
.
<EOS>
"
Adams
be
go
to
answer
,
when
one
of
the
young
fellow
cry
,
"
D####n
them
,
let
's
carry
them
both
before
the
justice
.
<EOS>
"
the
poor
woman
begin
to
tremble
,
and
Adams
lift
up
his
voice
,
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
three
or
four
of
them
lay
hand
on
him
;
and
one
hold
the
lanthorn
to
his
face
,
they
all
agree
he
have
the
most
villainous
countenance
they
ever
beheld
;
and
an
attorney
's
clerk
,
who
be
of
the
company
,
declare
he
be
sure
he
have
remember
him
at
the
bar
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
woman
,
her
hair
be
dishevel
in
the
struggle
,
and
her
nose
have
bleed
;
so
that
they
could
not
perceive
whether
she
be
handsome
or
ugly
,
but
they
say
her
fright
plainly
discover
her
guilt
.
<EOS>
and
search
her
pocket
,
as
they
do
those
of
Adams
,
for
money
,
which
the
fellow
say
he
have
lose
,
they
find
in
her
pocket
a
purse
with
some
gold
in
it
,
which
abundantly
convince
them
,
especially
as
the
fellow
offer
to
swear
to
it
.
<EOS>
Mr
Adams
be
find
to
have
no
more
than
one
halfpenny
about
him
.
<EOS>
this
the
clerk
say
"
be
a
great
presumption
that
he
be
an
old
offender
,
by
cunningly
give
all
the
booty
to
the
woman
.
"
<EOS>
to
which
all
the
rest
readily
assent
.
  
<EOS>
this
accident
promise
them
well
sport
than
what
they
have
propose
,
they
quit
their
intention
of
catch
bird
,
and
unanimously
resolve
to
proceed
to
the
justice
with
the
offender
.
<EOS>
be
inform
what
a
desperate
fellow
Adams
be
,
they
tie
his
hand
behind
him
;
and
,
have
hide
their
net
among
the
bush
,
and
the
lanthorn
be
carry
before
them
,
they
place
the
two
prisoner
in
their
front
,
and
then
begin
their
march
;
Adams
not
only
submit
patiently
to
his
own
fate
,
but
comfort
and
encourage
his
companion
under
her
suffering
.
  
<EOS>
whilst
they
be
on
their
way
the
clerk
inform
the
rest
that
this
adventure
would
prove
a
very
beneficial
one
;
for
that
they
would
all
be
entitle
to
their
proportion
of
L80
for
apprehend
the
robber
.
<EOS>
this
occasion
a
contention
concern
the
part
which
they
have
severally
bear
in
take
them
;
one
insist
he
ought
to
have
the
great
share
,
for
he
have
first
lay
his
hand
on
Adams
;
another
claim
a
superior
part
for
have
first
hold
the
lanthorn
to
the
man
's
face
on
the
ground
,
by
which
,
he
say
,
"
the
whole
be
discover
.
<EOS>
"
the
clerk
claim
four
-
fifth
of
the
reward
for
have
propose
to
search
the
prisoner
,
and
likewise
the
carry
them
before
the
justice
:
he
say
,
"
indeed
,
in
strict
justice
,
he
ought
to
have
the
whole
.
"
<EOS>
these
claim
,
however
,
they
at
last
consent
to
refer
to
a
future
decision
,
but
seem
all
to
agree
that
the
clerk
be
entitle
to
a
moiety
.
<EOS>
They
then
debate
what
money
should
be
allot
to
the
young
fellow
who
have
be
employ
only
in
hold
the
net
.
<EOS>
He
very
modestly
say
,
"
that
he
do
not
apprehend
any
large
proportion
would
fall
to
his
share
,
but
hope
they
would
allow
him
something
;
he
desire
them
to
consider
that
they
have
assign
their
net
to
his
care
,
which
prevent
him
from
be
as
forward
as
any
in
lay
hold
of
the
robber
"
(
for
so
those
innocent
people
be
call
)
;
"
that
if
he
have
not
occupy
the
net
,
some
other
must
;
"
conclude
,
however
,
"
that
he
should
be
content
with
the
small
share
imaginable
,
and
should
think
that
rather
their
bounty
than
his
merit
.
"
<EOS>
but
they
be
all
unanimous
in
exclude
him
from
any
part
whatever
,
the
clerk
particularly
swear
,
"
if
they
give
him
a
shilling
they
may
do
what
they
please
with
the
rest
;
for
he
would
not
concern
himself
with
the
affair
.
<EOS>
"
this
contention
be
so
hot
,
and
so
totally
engage
the
attention
of
all
the
party
,
that
a
dexterous
nimble
thief
,
have
he
be
in
Mr
Adams
's
situation
,
would
have
take
care
to
have
give
the
justice
no
trouble
that
evening
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
require
not
the
art
of
a
Sheppard
to
escape
,
especially
as
the
darkness
of
the
night
would
have
so
much
befriend
him
;
but
Adams
trust
rather
to
his
innocence
than
his
heel
,
and
,
without
thinking
of
flight
,
which
be
easy
,
or
resistance
(
which
be
impossible
,
as
there
be
six
lusty
young
fellow
,
besides
the
villain
himself
,
present
)
,
he
walk
with
perfect
resignation
the
way
they
think
proper
to
conduct
him
.
  
<EOS>
Adams
frequently
vent
himself
in
ejaculation
during
their
journey
;
at
last
,
poor
Joseph
Andrews
occur
to
his
mind
,
he
could
not
refrain
sigh
forth
his
name
,
which
be
hear
by
his
companion
in
affliction
,
she
cry
with
some
vehemence
,
"

I

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
leave
him

child
,
this
afternoon
,

Adams
,
"
in
the
stage

,
in

<EOS>
"
Can

Adams

<EOS>
"
I
hope

Mr

she

"
what
be
Mr

<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
never

servant
may

another

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
to
hear

say
Adams
;

a
virtuous
passion

young
man
be
what
no
woman
nee
be
ashamed
of

<EOS>
You
either
do
not
tell
me
truth
,
or
you
be
false
to
a
very
worthy
man

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Adams
then
tell
her
what
have
happen
at
the
inn
,
to
which
she
listen
very
attentively
;
and
a
sigh
often
escape
from
her
,
notwithstanding
her
utmost
endeavour
to
the
contrary
;
nor
could
she
prevent
herself
from
ask
a
thousand
question
,
which
would
have
assure
any
one
but
Adams
,
who
never
see
farther
into
people
than
they
desire
to
let
him
,
of
the
truth
of
a
passion
she
endeavour
to
conceal

<EOS>
indeed
,
the
fact
be
,
that
this
poor
girl
,
have
hear
of
Joseph
's
misfortune
,
by
some
of
the
servant
belong
to
the
coach
which
we
have
formerly
mention
to
have
stopt
at
the
inn
while
the
poor
youth
be
confine
to
his
bed
,
that
instant
abandon
the
cow
she
be
milk
,
and
,
take
with
her
a
little
bundle
of
clothe
under
her
arm
,
and
all
the
money
she
be
worth
in
her
own
purse
,
without
consult
any

,
immediately
set
forward
in
pursuit
of
one
whom
,
notwithstanding
her
shyness
to
the
parson
,
she
love
with
inexpressible
violence
,
though
with
the
pure
and
most
delicate
passion

<EOS>
this
shyness

therefore
,
as
we
trust
it
will
recommend
her
character
to
all

and
not

They

They

I

<EOS>
the

take
up
the

put
on
his
spectacle

some
word

pronounce
aloud

indeed

it
be
a
greek
manuscript

a

fine
piece

no

I

I

I

good

farther

not
I

<EOS>
I
will
commit
the

take
your
bail

<EOS>
"
Sir

cry
Adams

I
assure
you

"
perhaps
,

say
the
squire

there
may
be
some
mistake

pray
let
us
hear
Mr

relation

with

give
the

a
glass

wet
his
whistle
before
he
begin

<EOS>
I
know
how
to
behave
myself
to
gentleman

well

<EOS>
nobody
can
say
I
have
commit
a
gentleman
since
I
have
be
in
the
commission
.
<EOS>
"
Adams
then
begin
the
narrative
,
in
which
,
though
he
be
very
prolix
,
he
be
uninterrupted
,
unless
by
several
hum
and
hah
of
the
justice
,
and
his
desire
to
repeat
those
part
which
seem
to
him
most
material
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
finish
,
the
justice
,
who
,
on
what
the
squire
have
say
,
believe
every
syllable
of
his
story
on
his
bare
affirmation
,
notwithstanding
the
deposition
on
oath
to
the
contrary
,
begin
to
let
loose
several
rogue
and
rascal
against
the
witness
,
whom
he
order
to
stand
forth
,
but
in
vain
;
the
say
witness
,
long
since
find
what
turn
matter
be
likely
to
take
,
have
privily
withdraw
,
without
attend
the
issue
.
<EOS>
the
justice
now
fly
into
a
violent
passion
,
and
be
hardly
prevail
with
not
to
commit
the
innocent
fellow
who
have
be
impose
on
as
well
as
himself
.
<EOS>
He
swear
,
"
They
have
best
find
out
the
fellow
who
be
guilty
of
perjury
,
and
bring
him
before
him
within
two
day
,
or
he
would
bind
them
all
over
to
their
good
behaviour
.
"
<EOS>
They
all
promise
to
use
their
good
endeavour
to
that
purpose
,
and
be
dismiss
.
<EOS>
then
the
justice
insist
that
Mr
Adams
should
sit
down
and
take
a
glass
with
him
;
and
the
parson
of
the
parish
deliver
him
back
the
manuscript
without
say
a
word
;
nor
would
Adams
,
who
plainly
discern
his
ignorance
,
expose
it
.
<EOS>
as
for
Fanny
,
she
be
,
at
her
own
request
,
recommend
to
the
care
of
a
maid
-
servant
of
the
house
,
who
help
her
to
new
dress
and
clean
herself
.
  
<EOS>
the
company
in
the
parlour
have
not
be
long
seat
before
they
be
alarm
with
a
horrible
uproar
from
without
,
where
the
person
who
have
apprehend
Adams
and
Fanny
have
be
regale
,
accord
to
the
custom
of
the
house
,
with
the
justice
's
strong
beer
.
<EOS>
these
be
all
fall
together
by
the
ear
,
and
be
cuff
each
other
without
any
mercy
.
<EOS>
the
justice
himself
sally
out
,
and
with
the
dignity
of
his
presence
soon
put
an
end
to
the
fray
.
<EOS>
on
his
return
into
the
parlour
,
he
report
,
"
that
the
occasion
of
the
quarrel
be
no
other
than
a
dispute
to
whom
,
if
Adams
have
be
convict
,
the
great
share
of
the
reward
for
apprehend
him
have
belong
.
<EOS>
"
all
the
company
laugh
at
this
,
except
Adams
,
who
,
take
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
,
fetch
a
deep
groan
,
and
say
,
"
He
be
concerned
to
see
so
litigious
a
temper
in
man
.
<EOS>
that
he
remember
a
story
something
like
it
in
one
of
the
parish
where
his
cure
lie
:
 
<EOS>
there
be
,
"
continue
he
,
"
a
competition
between
three
young
fellow
for
the
place
of
the
clerk
,
which
I
dispose
of
,
to
the
good
of
my
ability
,
accord
to
merit
;
that
is
,
I
give
it
to
him
who
have
the
happy
knack
at
set
a
psalm
.
<EOS>
the
clerk
be
no
sooner
establish
in
his
place
than
a
contention
begin
between
the
two
disappointed
candidate
concern
their
excellence
;
each
contend
on
whom
,
have
they
two
be
the
only
competitor
,
my
election
would
have
fall
.
<EOS>
this
dispute
frequently
disturb
the
congregation
,
and
introduce
a
discord
into
the
psalmody
,
till
I
be
force
to
silence
them
both
.
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
the
litigious
spirit
could
not
be
stifle
;
and
,
be
no
longer
able
to
vent
itself
in
singing
,
it
now
break
forth
in
fighting
.
<EOS>
It
produce
many
battle
(
for
they
be
very
near
a
match
)
,
and
I
believe
would
have
end
fatally
,
have
not
the
death
of
the
clerk
give
me
an
opportunity
to
promote
one
of
them
to
his
place
;
which
presently
put
an
end
to
the
dispute
,
and
entirely
reconcile
the
contend
party
.
<EOS>
"
Adams
then
proceed
to
make
some
philosophical
observation
on
the
folly
of
grow
warm
in
dispute
in
which
neither
party
be
interested
.
<EOS>
He
then
apply
himself
vigorously
to
smoaking
;
and
a
long
silence
ensue
,
which
be
at
length
break
by
the
justice
,
who
begin
to
sing
forth
his
own
praise
,
and
to
value
himself
exceedingly
on
his
nice
discernment
in
the
cause
which
have
lately
be
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
quickly
interrupt
by
Mr
Adams
,
between
whom
and
his
worship
a
dispute
now
arise
,
whether
he
ought
not
,
in
strictness
of
law
,
to
have
commit
him
,
the
say
Adams
;
in
which
the
latter
maintain
he
ought
to
have
be
commit
,
and
the
justice
as
vehemently
hold
he
ought
not
.
<EOS>
this
have
most
probably
produce
a
quarrel
(
for
both
be
very
violent
and
positive
in
their
opinion
)
,
have
not
Fanny
accidentally
hear
that
a
young
fellow
be
go
from
the
justice
's
house
to
the
very
inn
where
the
stage
-
coach
in
which
Joseph
be
,
put
up
.
<EOS>
upon
this
news
,
she
immediately
send
for
the
parson
out
of
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
Adams
,
when
he
find
her
resolute
to
go
(
though
she
would
not
own
the
reason
,
but
pretend
she
could
not
bear
to
see
the
face
of
those
who
have
suspect
her
of
such
a
crime
)
,
be
as
fully
determined
to
go
with
her
;
he
accordingly
take
leave
of
the
justice
and
company
:
and
so
end
a
dispute
in
which
the
law
seem
shamefully
to
intend
to
set
a
magistrate
and
a
divine
together
by
the
ear
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
a
very
delightful
adventure
,
as
well
to
the
person
concern
as
to
the
good
-
natured
reader
.
  
<EOS>
Adams
,
Fanny
,
and
the
guide
,
set
out
together
about
one
in
the
morning
,
the
moon
be
then
just
rise
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
go
above
a
mile
before
a
most
violent
storm
of
rain
oblige
them
to
take
shelter
in
an
inn
,
or
rather
alehouse
,
where
Adams
immediately
procure
himself
a
good
fire
,
a
toast
and
ale
,
and
a
pipe
,
and
begin
to
smoke
with
great
content
,
utterly
forget
everything
that
have
happen
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
sit
likewise
down
by
the
fire
;
but
be
much
more
impatient
at
the
storm
.
<EOS>
She
presently
engage
the
eye
of
the
host
,
his
wife
,
the
maid
of
the
house
,
and
the
young
fellow
who
be
their
guide
;
they
all
conceive
they
have
never
see
anything
half
so
handsome
;
and
indeed
,
reader
,
if
thou
art
of
an
amorous
hue
,
I
advise
thee
to
skip
over
the
next
paragraph
;
which
,
to
render
our
history
perfect
,
we
be
oblige
to
set
down
,
humbly
hope
that
we
may
escape
the
fate
of
pygmalion
;
for
if
it
should
happen
to
us
,
or
to
thee
,
to
be
strike
with
this
picture
,
we
should
be
perhaps
in
as
helpless
a
condition
as
Narcissus
,
and
may
say
to
ourselves
,
Quod
petis
est
nusquam
.
<EOS>
or
,
if
the
fine
feature
in
it
should
set
Lady

's
image
before
our
eye
,
we
should
be
still
in
as
bad
a
situation

may
say
to
our
desire
,
Coelum

petimus
stultitia

<EOS>
Fanny
be
now
in
the
nineteenth
year
of
her
age
;
she
be
tall
and
delicately
shape
;
but
not
one
of
those
slender
young
woman
who
seem
rather
intend
to
hang
up
in
the
hall
of
an
anatomist
than
for
any
other
purpose
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
she
be
so
plump
that
she
seem
burst
through
her
tight
stay
,
especially
in
the
part
which
confine
her
swelling
breast
.
<EOS>
nor
do
her
hip
want
the
assistance
of
a
hoop
to
extend
them
.
<EOS>
the
exact
shape
of
her
arm
denote
the
form
of
those
limb
which
she
conceal
;
and
though
they
be
a
little
redden
by
her
labour
,
yet
,
if
her
sleeve
slip
above
her
elbow
,
or
her
handkerchief
discover
any
part
of
her
neck
,
a
whiteness
appear
which
the
fine
italian
paint
would
be
unable
to
reach
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
be
of
a
chesnut
brown
,
and
nature
have
be
extremely
lavish
to
her
of
it
,
which
she
have
cut
,
and
on
Sundays
use
to
curl
down
her
neck

in
the
modern
fashion

<EOS>
Her
forehead
be
high

her
eyebrow
arch

and
rather
full
than
otherwise

<EOS>
Her
eye
black
and
sparkling
;
her
nose
just
incline
to
the
Roman
;
her
lip
red
and
moist
,
and
her
underlip
,
accord
to
the
opinion
of
the
lady
,
too
pouting
.
<EOS>
Her
tooth
be
white
,
but
not
exactly
even
.
<EOS>
the
small
-
pox
have
leave
one
only
mark
on
her
chin
,
which
be
so
large
,
it
may
have
be
mistake
for
a
dimple

have
not
her
left
cheek
produce
one
so
near
a
neighbour
to
it
,
that
the
former
serve
only
for
a
foil
to
the
latter
.
<EOS>
Her
complexion
be
fair
,
a
little
injure
by
the
sun
,
but
overspread
with
such
a
bloom
that
the
fine
lady
would
have
exchange
all
their
white
for
it
:
add
to
these
a
countenance
in
which
,
though
she
be
extremely
bashful
,
a
sensibility
appear
almost
incredible
;
and
a
sweetness
,
whenever
she
smile
,
beyond
either
imitation
or
description
.
<EOS>
to
conclude
all
,
she
have
a
natural
gentility

superior
to
the
acquisition

which
surprize
all

<EOS>
this

Tho

I

ah

<EOS>
a

My

<EOS>
Adams
have
be
ruminate
all
this
time
on
a
passage
in
Aeschylus
,
without
attend
in
the
least
to
the
voice
,
though
one
of
the
most
melodious
that
ever
be
hear
,
when
,
cast
his
eye
on
Fanny
,
he
cry
out
,
"
bless
us
<EOS>
,
you
look
extremely
pale
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pale
!
<EOS>
Mr
Adams
,
"
say
she
;
"
o
Jesus
!
"
<EOS>
and
fall
backwards
in
her
chair
.
<EOS>
Adams
jump
up
,
fling
his
Aeschylus
into
the
fire
,
and
fall
a
-
roaring
to
the
people
of
the
house
for
help
.
<EOS>
He
soon
summon
every
one
into
the
room
,
and
the
songster
among
the
rest
;
but
,
o
reader
!
<EOS>
when
this
nightingale
,
who
be
no
other
than
Joseph
Andrews
himself
,
see
his
beloved
Fanny
in
the
situation
we
have
describe
her
,
canst
thou
conceive
the
agitation
of
his
mind
?
<EOS>
if
thou
canst
not
,
waive
that
meditation
to
behold
his
happiness
,
when
,
clasp
her
in
his
arm
,
he
find
life
and
blood
return
into
her
cheek
:
when
he
see
her
open
her
beloved
eye
,
and
hear
her
with
the
soft
accent
whisper
,
"
be
you
Joseph
Andrews
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
art
thou
my
Fanny
?
"
<EOS>
he
answer
eagerly
:
and
,
pull
her
to
his
heart
,
he
imprint
numberless
kiss
on
her
lip
,
without
consider
who
be
present
.
  
<EOS>
if
prude
be
offend
at
the
lusciousness
of
this
picture
,
they
may
take
their
eye
off
from
it
,
and
survey
parson
Adams
dance
about
the
room
in
a
rapture
of
joy
.
<EOS>
some
philosopher
may
perhaps
doubt
whether
he
be
not
the
happy
of
the
three
:
for
the
goodness
of
his
heart
enjoy
the
blessing
which
be
exult
in
the
breast
of
both
the
other
two
,
together
with
his
own
.
<EOS>
but
we
shall
leave
such
disquisition
,
as
too
deep
for
us
,
to
those
who
be
build
some
favourite
hypothesis
,
which
they
will
refuse
no
metaphysical
rubbish
to
erect
and
support
:
for
our
part
,
we
give
it
clearly
on
the
side
of
Joseph
,
whose
happiness
be
not
only
great
than
the
parson
's
,
but
of
long
duration
:
for
as
soon
as
the
first
tumult
of
Adams
's
rapture
be
over
he
cast
his
eye
towards
the
fire
,
where
Aeschylus
lie
expire
;
and
immediately
rescue
the
poor
remain
,
to
wit
,
the
sheepskin
covering
,
of
his
dear
friend
,
which
be
the
work
of
his
own
hand
,
and
have
be
his
inseparable
companion
for
upward
of
thirty
year
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
have
no
sooner
perfectly
recover
herself
than
she
begin
to
restrain
the
impetuosity
of
her
transport
;
and
,
reflect
on
what
she
have
do
and
suffer
in
the
presence
of
so
many
,
she
be
immediately
cover
with
confusion
;
and
,
push
Joseph
gently
from
her
,
she
beg
him
to
be
quiet
,
nor
would
admit
of
either
kiss
or
embrace
any
longer
.
<EOS>
then
,
see
Mrs
Slipslop
,
she
curtsy
,
and
offer
to
advance
to
her
;
but
that
high
woman
would
not
return
her
curtsy
;
but
,
cast
her
eye
another
way
,
immediately
withdraw
into
another
room
,
muttering
,
as
she
go
,
she
wonder
who
the
creature
be
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
a
dissertation
concern
high
people
and
low
people
,
with
Mrs
Slipslop
's
departure
in
no
very
good
temper
of
mind
,
and
the
evil
plight
in
which
she
leave
Adams
and
his
company
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
doubtless
seem
extremely
odd
to
many
reader
,
that
Mrs
Slipslop
,
who
have
live
several
year
in
the
same
house
with
Fanny
,
should
,
in
a
short
separation
,
utterly
forget
her
.
<EOS>
and
indeed
the
truth
be
,
that
she
remember
her
very
well
.
<EOS>
as
we
would
not
willingly
,
therefore
,
that
anything
should
appear
unnatural
in
this
our
history
,
we
will
endeavour
to
explain
the
reason
of
her
conduct
;
nor
do
we
doubt
be
able
to
satisfy
the
most
curious
reader
that
Mrs
Slipslop
do
not
in
the
least
deviate
from
the
common
road
in
this
behaviour
;
and
,
indeed
,
have
she
do
otherwise
,
she
must
have
descend
below
herself
,
and
would
have
very
justly
be
liable
to
censure
.
  
<EOS>
be
it
known
then
,
that
the
human
specie
be
divide
into
two
sort
of
people
,
to
wit
,
high
people
and
low
people
.
<EOS>
as
by
high
people
I
would
not
be
understand
to
mean
person
literally
bear
higher
in
their
dimension
than
the
rest
of
the
specie
,
nor
metaphorically
those
of
exalted
character
or
ability
;
so
by
low
people
I
can
not
be
construe
to
intend
the
reverse
.
<EOS>
high
people
signify
no
other
than
people
of
fashion
,
and
low
people
those
of
no
fashion
.
<EOS>
now
,
this
word
fashion
hath
by
long
use
lose
its
original
meaning
,
from
which
at
present
it
give
us
a
very
different
idea
;
for
I
be
deceive
if
by
person
of
fashion
we
do
not
generally
include
a
conception
of
birth
and
accomplishment
superior
to
the
herd
of
mankind
;
whereas
,
in
reality
,
nothing
more
be
originally
mean
by
a
person
of
fashion
than
a
person
who
drest
himself
in
the
fashion
of
the
time
;
and
the
word
really
and
truly
signify
no
more
at
this
day
.
<EOS>
now
,
the
world
be
thus
divide
into
people
of
fashion
and
people
of
no
fashion
,
a
fierce
contention
arise
between
them
;
nor
would
those
of
one
party
,
to
avoid
suspicion
,
be
see
publicly
to
speak
to
those
of
the
other
,
though
they
often
hold
a
very
good
correspondence
in
private
.
<EOS>
in
this
contention
it
be
difficult
to
say
which
party
succeed
;
for
,
whilst
the
people
of
fashion
seize
several
place
to
their
own
use
,
such
as
court
,
assembly
,
opera
,
balls
,
&
c.
,
the
people
of
no
fashion
,
besides
one
royal
place
,
call
his
Majesty
's
bear
-
garden
,
have
be
in
constant
possession
of
all
hop
,
fair
,
revels
,
&
<EOS>
c.
two
place
have
be
agree
to
be
divide
between
them
,
namely
,
the
church
and
the
playhouse
,
where
they
segregate
themselves
from
each
other
in
a
remarkable
manner
;
for
,
as
the
people
of
fashion
exalt
themselves
at
church
over
the
head
of
the
people
of
no
fashion
,
so
in
the
playhouse
they
abase
themselves
in
the
same
degree
under
their
foot
.
<EOS>
this
distinction
I
have
never
meet
with
any
one
able
to
account
for
:
it
be
sufficient
that
,
so
far
from
look
on
each
other
as
brother
in
the
christian
language
,
they
seem
scarce
to
regard
each
other
as
of
the
same
specie
.
<EOS>
this
,
the
term
"
strange
person
<EOS>
,
people
one
do
not
know
,
the
creature
,
wretch
,
beast
,
brute
,
"
and
many
other
appellation
evidently
demonstrate
;
which
Mrs
Slipslop
,
have
often
hear
her
mistress
use
,
think
she
have
also
a
right
to
use
in
her
turn
;
and
perhaps
she
be
not
mistake
;
for
these
two
party
,
especially
those
border
nearly
on
each
other
,
to
wit
,
the
low
of
the
high
,
and
the
high
of
the
low
,
often
change
their
party
accord
to
place
and
time
;
for
those
who
be
people
of
fashion
in
one
place
be
often
people
of
no
fashion
in
another
.
<EOS>
and
with
regard
to
time
,
it
may
not
be
unpleasant
to
survey
the
picture
of
dependance
like
a
kind
of
ladder
;
as
,
for
instance
;
early
in
the
morning
arise
the
postillion
,
or
some
other
boy
,
which
great
family
,
no
more
than
great
ship
,
be
without
,
and
fall
to
brush
the
clothe
and
clean
the
shoe
of
John
the
footman
;
who
,
be
dr
himself
,
apply
his
hand
to
the
same
labour
for
Mr
second
-
hand
,
the
squire
's
gentleman
;
the
gentleman
in
the
like
manner
,
a
little
later
in
the
day
,
attend
the
squire
;
the
squire
be
no
sooner
equipped
than
he
attend
the
levee
of
my
lord
;
which
be
no
sooner
over
than
my
lord
himself
be
see
at
the
levee
of
the
favourite
,
who
,
after
the
hour
of
homage
be
at
an
end
,
appear
himself
to
pay
homage
to
the
levee
of
his
sovereign
.
<EOS>
nor
be
there
,
perhaps
,
in
this
whole
ladder
of
dependance
,
any
one
step
at
a
great
distance
from
the
other
than
the
first
from
the
second
;
so
that
to
a
philosopher
<EOS>
the
question
may
only
seem
,
whether
you
would
chuse
to
be
a
great
man
at
six
in
the
morning
,
or
at
two
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
and
yet
there
be
scarce
two
of
these
who
do
not
think
the
least
familiarity
with
the
person
below
them
a
condescension
,
and
,
if
they
be
to
go
one
step
farther
,
a
degradation
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
reader
,
I
hope
thou
wilt
pardon
<EOS>
this
long
digression
,
which
seem
to
me
necessary
to
vindicate
the
great
character
of
Mrs
Slipslop
from
what
low
people
,
who
have
never
see
high
people
,
may
think
an
absurdity
;
but
we
who
know
them
must
have
daily
find
very
high
person
know
us
in
one
place
and
not
in
another
,
to
-
day
and
not
to
-
morrow
;
all
which
it
be
difficult
to
account
for
otherwise
than
I
have
here
endeavour
;
and
perhaps
,
if
the
god
,
accord
to
the
opinion
of
some
,
make
man
only
to
laugh
at
them
,
there
be
no
part
of
our
behaviour
which
answer
the
end
of
our
creation
better
than
this
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
our
history
:
<EOS>
Adams
,
who
know
no
more
of
this
than
the
cat
which
sit
on
the
table
,
imagine
Mrs
Slipslop
's
memory
have
be
much
bad
than
it
really
be
,
follow
her
into
the
next
room
,
cry
out
,
"
Madam
Slipslop
,
here
be
one
of
your
old
acquaintance
;
do
but
see
what
a
fine
woman
she
be
grow
since
she
leave
Lady
Booby
's
service
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
reflect
something
of
her
,
"
answer
she
,
with
great
dignity
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
remember
all
the
inferior
servant
in
our
family
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
then
proceed
to
satisfy
Adams
's
curiosity
,
by
tell
him
,
"
when
she
arrive
at
the
inn
,
she
find
a
chaise
ready
for
her
;
that
,
her
lady
be
expect
very
shortly
in
the
country
,
she
be
oblige
to
make
the
utmost
haste
;
and
,
in
commensuration
of
Joseph
's
lameness
,
she
have
take
him
with
her
;
"
and
lastly
,
"
that
the
excessive
virulence
of
the
storm
have
drive
them
into
the
house
where
he
find
them
.
"
<EOS>
after
which
,
she
acquaint
Adams
with
his
have
leave
his
horse
,
and
expr
some
wonder
at
his
have
strayed
so
far
out
of
his
way
,
and
at
meet
him
,
as
she
say
,
"
in
the
company
of
that
wench
,
who
she
fear
be
no
well
than
she
should
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
horse
be
no
sooner
put
into
Adams
's
head
but
he
be
immediately
drive
out
by
this
reflection
on
the
character
of
Fanny
.
<EOS>
He
protest
,
"
He
believe
there
be
not
a
chaster
damsel
in
the
universe
.
<EOS>
I
heartily
wish
,
I
heartily
wish
,
"
cry
he
(
snap
his
finger
)
,
"
that
all
her
better
be
as
good
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
proceed
to
inform
her
of
the
accident
of
their
meeting
;
but
when
he
come
to
mention
the
circumstance
of
deliver
her
from
the
rape
,
she
say
,
"
She
think
him
properer
for
the
army
than
the
clergy
;
that
it
do
not
become
a
clergyman
to
lay
violent
hand
on
any
one
;
that
he
should
have
rather
pray
that
she
may
be
strengthen
.
"
<EOS>
Adams
say
,
"
He
be
very
far
from
be
ashamed
of
what
he
have
do
:
"
she
reply
,
"
want
of
shame
be
not
the
currycuristic
of
a
clergyman
.
"
<EOS>
this
dialogue
may
have
probably
grow
warm
,
have
not
Joseph
opportunely
enter
the
room
,
to
ask
leave
of
Madam
Slipslop
to
introduce
Fanny
:
but
she
positively
refuse
to
admit
any
such
trollop
,
and
tell
him
,
"
She
would
have
be
burn
before
she
would
have
suffer
him
to
get
into
a
chaise
with
her
,
if
she
have
once
respect
him
of
have
his
slut
waylaid
on
the
road
for
him
;
"
add
,
"
that
Mr
Adams
act
a
very
pretty
part
,
and
she
do
not
doubt
but
to
see
him
a
bishop
.
"
<EOS>
He
make
the
good
bow
he
could
,
and
cry
out
,
"
I
thank
you
,
madam
,
for
that
right
-
reverend
appellation
,
which
I

take
all
honest

"
 
<EOS>
"
very
honest
mean
,
"
return
she
,
with
a
sneer
,
"
to
bring
people
together
.
<EOS>
"
at
these
word
Adams
take
two
or
three
stride
across
the
room
,
when
the
coachman
come
to
inform
Mrs
Slipslop
,
"
that
the
storm
be
over
,
and
the
moon
shine
very
bright
.
"
<EOS>
She
then
send
for
Joseph
,
who
be
sit
without
with
his
Fanny
,
and
would
have
have
him
go
with
her
;
but
he
peremptorily
refuse
to
leave
Fanny
behind
,
which
throw
the
good
woman
into
a
violent
rage
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
"
She
would
inform
her
lady
what
doing
be
carry
on
,
and
do
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
she
would
rid
the
parish
of
all
such
people
;
"
and
conclude
a
long
speech
,
full
of
bitterness
and
very
hard
word
,
with
some
reflection
on
the
clergy
not
decent
to
repeat
;
at
last
,
find
Joseph
unmoveable
,
she
fling
herself
into
the
chaise
,
cast
a
look
at
Fanny
as
she
go
,
not
unlike
that
which
Cleopatra
give
Octavia
in
the
play
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
she
be
most
disagreeably
disappoint
by
the
presence
of
Fanny
:
she
have
,
from
her
first
see
Joseph
at
the
inn
,
conceive
hope
of
something
which
may
have
be
accomplish
at
an
alehouse
as
well
as
a
palace
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
probable
Mr
Adams
have
rescue
more
than
Fanny
from
the
clanger
of
a
rape
that
evening
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
chaise
have
carry
off
the
enraged
Slipslop
,
Adams
,
Joseph
,
and
Fanny
assemble
over
the
fire
,
where
they
have
a
great
deal
of
innocent
chat
,
pretty
enough
;
but
,
as
possibly
it
would
not
be
very
entertaining
to
the
reader
,
we
shall
hasten
to
the
morning
;
only
observe
that
none
of
them
go
to
bed
that
night
.
<EOS>
Adams
,
when
he
have
smoake
three
pipe
,
take
a
comfortable
nap
in
a
great
chair
,
and
leave
the
lover
,
whose
eye
be
too
well
employ
to
permit
any
desire
of
shut
them
,
to
enjoy
by
themselves
,
during
some
hour
,
an
happiness
which
none
of
my
reader
who
have
never
be
in
love
be
capable
of
the
least
conception
of
,
though
we
have
as
many
tongue
as
Homer
desire
,
to
describe
it
with
,
and
which
all
true
lover
will
represent
to
their
own
mind
without
the
least
assistance
from
us
.
  
<EOS>
let
it
suffice
then
to
say
,
that
Fanny
,
after
a
thousand
entreaty
,
at
last
give
up
her
whole
soul
to
Joseph
;
and
,
almost
faint
in
his
arm
,
with
a
sigh
infinitely
soft
and
sweeter
too
than
any
arabian
breeze
,
she
whisper
to
his
lip
,
which
be
then
close
to
her
,
"
o
Joseph
,
you
have
win
me
:
I
will
be
yours
for
ever
.
"
<EOS>
Joseph
,
have
thank
her
on
his
knee
,
and
embrace
her
with
an
eagerness
which
she
now
almost
return
,
leapt
up
in
a
rapture
,
and
awaken
the
parson
,
earnestly
beg
him
"
that
he
would
that
instant
join
their
hand
together
.
<EOS>
"
Adams
rebuke
him
for
his
request
,
and
tell
him
"
He
would
by
no
means
consent
to
anything
contrary
to
the
form
of
the
Church
;
that
he
have
no
licence
,
nor
indeed
would
he
advise
him
to
obtain
one
;
that
the
Church
have
prescribe
a
form
 
namely
,
the
publication
of
bann
 
with
which
all
good
Christians
ought
to
comply
,
and
to
the
omission
of
which
he
attribute
the
many
misery
which
befell
great
folk
in
marriage
;
"
conclude
,
"
as
many
as

together

"
<EOS>
Fanny
agree
with
the
parson
,
say
to
Joseph
,
with
a
blush
,
"
She
assure
him
she
would
not
consent
to
any
such
thing
,
and
that
she
wonder
at
his
offering
it
.
"
<EOS>
in
which
resolution
she
be
comfort
and
commend
by
Adams
;
and
Joseph
be
oblige
to
wait
patiently
till
after
the
third
publication
of
the
bann
,
which
,
however
,
he
obtain
the
consent
of
Fanny
,
in
the
presence
of
Adams
,
to
put
in
at
their
arrival
.
  
<EOS>
the
sun
have
be
now
rise
some
hour
,
when
Joseph
,
find
his
leg
surprizingly
recover
,
propose
to
walk
forwards
;
but
when
they
be
all
ready
to
set
out
,
an
accident
a
little
retarded
them
.
<EOS>
this
be
no
other
than
the
reckoning
,
which
amount
to
seven
shilling
;
no
great
sum
if
we
consider
the
immense
quantity
of
ale
which
Mr
Adams
pour
in
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
they
have
no
objection
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
bill
,
but
many
to
the
probability
of
pay
it
;
for
the
fellow
who
have
take
poor
Fanny
's
purse
have
unluckily

to

<EOS>
Parson

come
to
the
house
of
parson
Trulliber
,
whom
he
find
stript
into
his
waistcoat
,
with
an
apron
on
,
and
a
pail
in
his
hand
,
just
come
from
serve
his
hog
;
for
Mr
Trulliber
be
a
parson
on
Sundays
,
but
all
the
other
six
may
more
properly
be
call
a
farmer
.
<EOS>
He
occupy
a
small
piece
of
land
of
his
own
,
besides
which
he
rent
a
considerable
deal
more
.
<EOS>
His
wife

chiefly
to
his
care
,
which
he
carefully
wait
on
at
home
,
and
attend
to
fair
;
on
which
occasion
he
be
liable
to
many
joke
,
his
own
size
being
,
with
much
ale
,
render
little
inferior
to
that
of
the
beast
he
sell
.
<EOS>
He
be
indeed
one
of
the
large
man
you
should
see
,
and
could
have
act
the
part
of
Sir
John
Falstaff
without
stuff
.
<EOS>
add
to
this
that
the
rotundity
of
his
belly
be
considerably
increase
by
the
shortness
of
his
stature
,
his
shadow
ascend
very
near
as
far
in
height
,
when
he
lie
on
his
back
,
as
when
he
stand
on
his
leg
.
<EOS>
His
voice
be
loud
and
hoarse
,
and
his
accent
extremely
broad
.
<EOS>
to
complete
the
whole
,
he
have
a
stateliness
in
his
gait
,
when
he
walk
,
not
unlike
that

a
goose
,
only
he
stalk
slower
.
  
<EOS>
Mr

be
the

in
which
he
always

his
company
at
home
.
<EOS>
His
wife
,
who
inform

of
Mr
Adams
's
arrival
,
have
make
a
small
mistake
;
for

her
husband
,
"
She
believe

a
man

for
some
of
his
hog
.
<EOS>
"

supposition
make
Mr
Trulliber
hasten
with
the
utmost
expedition
to
attend
his
guest
.
<EOS>
He
no
sooner

,
not
in
the
least
doubt
the
cause
of
his
errand
to
be
what

,
"
He

in
very
good
time
;
that
he

dealer
that
very
afternoon
;

and
add
,
"
they
be
all
pure
and
fat
,
and
upward
of
twenty
score

piece

<EOS>
Adams

"
He
believe

"
<EOS>
"

,
"
I

<EOS>
I

very
well
,
but

a
word
more
till

,
though
I
have
never
sell
thee
a
flitch
of
such
bacon
as

in
the
stye
.
"
<EOS>
upon
which
he
lay
violent
hand
on
Adams
,
and
drag
him
into
the
hog
-
stye
,
which
be

<EOS>
They

<EOS>
step

"
at

into
the
pig

stye
,
insist
on
it
that

beyond
any
artificial

and

the
unruly
beast
give
such
a
sudden
spring
,
that
he
throw

all
along
in
the
mire

<EOS>
Trulliber
,
instead
of

him
to
get
up
,
burst
into
a
laughter
,
and
,
enter
the
stye
,
say
to

with
some
contempt

dost
not
know
how
to
handle
a

?
"
and
be
go
to
lay
hold
of
one

,
but
Adams

who
think
he
have
carry
his
complacence
far
enough
,
be

sooner
on
his
leg
than
he
escape
out
of
the
reach
of
the
animal
,
and
cry
out
,
"
Nihil

<EOS>
I
be
a
clergyman

sir
,
and
be
not
come
to
buy
hog
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Trulliber
answer
,
"
He
be
sorry
for
the
mistake
,
but
that
he
must
blame
his
wife
,
"
add
,
"
she
be
a
fool
,
and
always
commit
blunder
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
desire
him
to
walk
in
and
clean
himself
,
that
he
would
only
fasten
up
the
stye
and
follow
him
.
<EOS>
Adams
desire
leave
to
dry
his
greatcoat
,
wig
,
and
hat
by
the
fire
,
which
Trulliber
grant
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Trulliber
would
have
bring
him
a
basin
of
water
to
wash
his
face
,
but
her
husband
bid
her
be
quiet
like
a
fool
as
she
be
,
or
she
would
commit
more
blunder
,
and
then
direct
Adams
to
the
pump
.
<EOS>
while
Adams
be
thus
employ
,
Trulliber
,
conceive
no
great
respect
for
the
appearance
of
his
guest
,

the
parlour
door
,
and
now
conduct
him
into
the
kitchen
,
tell
him
he
believe
a
cup
of
drink
would
do
him
no
harm
,
and
whisper
his
wife
to
draw
a
little
of
the
bad
ale
.
<EOS>
after
a
short
silence
Adams
say
,
"
I
fancy
,
sir
,
you
already
perceive
me
to
be
a
clergyman
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
,
"
cry
Trulliber
,
grin
,
"
I
perceive
you
have
some
cassock
;
I
will
not
venture
to
caale
it
a
whole
one
.
"
<EOS>
Adams
answer
,
"
It
be
indeed
none
of
the
good
,
but
he
have
the
misfortune
to
tear
it
about
ten
year
ago
in
pass
over
a
stile
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Trulliber
,
return
with
the
drink
,
tell
her
husband
,
"
She
fancy
the
gentleman
be
a
traveller
,
and
that
he
would
be
glad
to
eat
a
bit
.
"
<EOS>
Trulliber
bid
her
hold
her
impertinent
tongue
,
and
ask
her
,
"
if
parson
use
to
travel
without
horse
?
<EOS>
"
add
,
"
he
suppose
the
gentleman
have
none
by
his
have
no
boot
on
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
yes
,
"
say
Adams
;
"
I
have
a
horse
,
but
I
have
leave
him
behind
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
hear
you
have
one
,
"
say
Trulliber
;
"
for
I
assure
you
I
do
not
love
to
see
clergyman
on
foot
;
it
be
not
seemly
nor
suit
the
dignity
of
the
cloth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
Trulliber
make
a
long
oration
on
the
dignity
of
the
cloth
(
or
rather
gown
)
not
much
worth
relate
,
till
his
wife
have
spread
the
table
and
set
a
mess
of
porridge
on
it
for
his
breakfast
.
<EOS>
He
then
say
to
Adams
,
"
I
do
not
know
,
friend
,
how
you
come
to
caale
on
me
;
however
,
as
you
be
here
,
if
you
think
proper
to
eat
a
morsel
,
you
may
.
"
<EOS>
Adams
accept
the
invitation
,
and
the
two
parson
sit
down
together
;
Mrs
Trulliber
wait
behind
her
husband
's
chair
,
as
be
,
it
seem
,
her
custom
.
<EOS>
Trulliber
eat
heartily
,
but
scarce
put
anything
in
his
mouth
without
find
fault
with
his
wife
's
cookery
.
<EOS>
all
which
the
poor
woman
bore
patiently
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
be
so
absolute
an
admirer
of
her
husband
's
greatness
and
importance
,
of
which
she
have
frequent
hint
from
his
own
mouth
,
that
she
almost
carry
her
adoration
to
an
opinion
of
his
infallibility
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
the
parson
have
exercise
her
more
way
than
one
;
and
the
pious
woman
have
so
well
edify
by
her
husband
's
sermon
,
that
she
have
resolve
to
receive
the
bad
thing
of
this
world
together
with
the
good
.

by

love

partly
by

you

deceive

cry
Trulliber

"
dost
thou
speak
against

get
out

the

"
name
not
the

<EOS>
"
how
!
not

do
you
disbelieve
the
scripture

cry
Trulliber

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
;
but
you
do
,
"
answer
Adams
,
"
if
I
may
reason
from
your
practice

for
their
command
be
so
explicit

their
reward
and
punishment
so
immense

that
it
be
impossible
a

now

there
be
no

more
express

no

whoever

"
I
would
not
advise
thee

say
Trulliber

"
to
say
that
I

I
will
not

it

good

(
<EOS>
and
indeed
,
though
he
be
now
rather
too
corpulent
for
athletic
exercise

he
have

in
his

,
be
one

the
good

see
him
clench
his

interpose

and
beg
him
not
to
fight
,
but
show
himself
a
true
Christian
,
and
take
the
law
of
him
.
<EOS>
as
nothing
could
provoke
Adams
to
strike
,
but
an
absolute
assault
on
himself
or
his
friend
,
he
smile
at
the
angry
look
and
gesture
of
Trulliber
;
and
,
tell
him
he
be
sorry
to
see
such
man
in
order
,
depart
without
further
ceremony

.
  
<EOS>
an
adventure
,
the
consequence
of
a
new
instance
which
parson
Adams
give
of
his
forgetfulness
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
come
back
to
the
inn
he
find
Joseph
and
Fanny
sit
together
.
<EOS>
They
be
so
far
from
think
his
absence
long
,
as
he
have
fear
they
would
,
that
they
never
once
miss
or
think
of
him
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
have
be
often
assure
by
both
,
that
they
spend
these
hour
in
a
most
delightful
conversation
;
but
,
as
I
never
could
prevail
on
either
to
relate
it
,
so
I
can
not
communicate
it
to
the
reader
.
  
<EOS>
Adams
acquaint
the
lover
with
the
ill
success
of
his
enterprize
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
greatly
confound
,
none
be
able
to
propose
any
method
of
departing
,
till
Joseph
at
last
advise
call
in
the
hostess
,
and
desire
her
to
trust
them
;
which
Fanny
say
she
despair
of
her
do
,
as
she
be
one
of
the
sourest
-
face
woman
she
have
ever
behold
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
be
agreeably
disappointed
;
for
the
hostess
be
no
sooner
ask
the
question
than
she
readily
agree
;
and
,
with
a
curtsy
and
smile
,
wish
them
a
good
journey
.
<EOS>
however
,
lest
Fanny
's
skill
in
physiognomy
should
be
call
in
question
,
we
will
venture
to
assign
one
reason
which
may
probably
incline
her
to
this
confidence
and
good
-
humour
.
<EOS>
when
Adams
say
he
be
go
to
visit
his
brother
,
he
have
unwittingly
impose
on
Joseph
and
Fanny
,
who
both
believe
he
have
mean
his
natural
brother
,
and
not
his
brother
in
divinity
,
and
have
so
inform
the
hostess
,
on
her
enquiry
after
him
.
<EOS>
now
Mr
Trulliber
have
,
by
his
profession
of
piety
,
by
his
gravity
,
austerity
,
reserve
,
and
the
opinion
of
his
great
wealth
,
so
great
an
authority
in
his
parish
,
that
they
all
live
in
the
utmost
fear
and
apprehension
of
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
therefore
no
wonder
that
the
hostess
,
who
know
it
be
in
his
option
whether
she
should
ever
sell
another
mug
of
drink
,
do
not
dare
to
affront
his
suppose
brother
by
deny
him
credit
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
now
just
on
their
departure
when
Adams
recollect
he
have
leave
his
greatcoat
and
hat
at
Mr
Trulliber
's
.
<EOS>
as
he
be
not
desirous
of
renew
his
visit
,
the
hostess
herself
,
have
no
servant
at
home
,
offer
to
fetch
it
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
an
unfortunate
expedient
;
for
the
hostess
be
soon
undeceive
in
the
opinion
she
have
entertain
of
Adams
,
whom
Trulliber
abuse
in
the
gross
term
,
especially
when
he
hear
he
have
have
the
assurance
to
pretend
to
be
his
near
relation
.
  
<EOS>
at
her
return
,
therefore
,
she
entirely
change
her
note
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
"
folk
may
be
ashamed
of
travel
about
,
and
pretend
to
be
what
they
be
not
.
<EOS>
that
taxis
be
high
,
and
for
her
part
she
be
oblige
to
pay
for
what
she
have
;
she
could
not
therefore
possibly
,
nor
would
she
,
trust
anybody
;
no
,
not
her
own
father
.
<EOS>
that
money
be
never
scarcer
,
and
she
want
to
make
up
a
sum
.
<EOS>
that
she
expect
,
therefore
,
they
should
pay
their
reckoning
before
they
leave
the
house
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adams
be
now
greatly
perplex
;
but
,
as
he
know
that
he
could
easily
have
borrow
such
a
sum
in
his
own
parish
,
and
as
he
know
he
would
have
lend
it
himself
to
any
mortal
in
distress
,
so
he
take
fresh
courage
,
and
sally
out
all
round
the
parish
,
but
to
no
purpose
;
he
return
as
pennyless
as
he
go
,
groaning
and
lament
that
it
be
possible
,
in
a
country
profess
Christianity
,
for
a
wretch
to
starve
in
the
midst
of
his
fellow
-
creature
who
abound
.
  
<EOS>
whilst
he
be
go
,
the
hostess
,
who
stay
as
a
sort
of
guard
with
Joseph
and
Fanny
,
entertain
them
with
the
goodness
of
parson
Trulliber
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
he
have
not
only
a
very
good
character
as
to
other
quality
in
the
neighbourhood
,
but
be
repute
a
man
of
great
charity
;
for
,
though
he
never
give
a
farthing
,
he
have
always
that
word
in
his
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
Adams
be
no
sooner
return
the
second
time
than
the
storm
grow
exceedingly
high
,
the
hostess
declaring
,
among
other
thing
,
that
,
if
they
offer
to
stir
without
pay
her

Plato
and
Aristotle
,
or
somebody
else
,
hath
say
,
that
when
the
most
exquisite
cunning
fail
,
chance
often
hit
the
mark
,
and
that
by
mean
the
least
expect
.
<EOS>
Virgil
express
this
very
boldly
:
    
Turne
,
quod
<EOS>

Auderet

<EOS>
I
would
quote
more
great
man
if
I
could
;
but
my
memory
not
permit
me
,
I
will
proceed
to
exemplify
these
observation
by
the
follow
instance
:
    
<EOS>
there
chance
(
for
Adams
have
not
cunne
enough
to
contrive
it
)
to
be
at
that
time
in
the
alehouse
a
fellow
who
have
be
formerly
a
drummer
in
an
irish
regiment
,
and
now
travel
the
country
as
a
pedlar
.
<EOS>
this
man
,
have
attentively
listen
to
the
discourse
of
the
hostess
,
at
last
take
Adams
aside
,
and
ask
him
what
the
sum
be
for
which
they
be
detain
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
be
inform
,
he
sigh
,
and
say
,
"
He
be
sorry
it
be
so
much
;
for
that
he
have
no
more
than
six
shilling
and
sixpence
in
his
pocket
,
which
he
would
lend
them
with
all
his
heart
.
"
<EOS>
Adams
give
a
caper
,
and
cry'd
out
,
"
It
would
do
;
for
that
he
have
sixpence
himself
.
"
<EOS>
and
thus
these
poor
people
,
who
could
not
engage
the
compassion
of
rich
and
piety
,
be
at
length
deliver
out
of
their
distress
by
the
charity
of
a
poor
pedlar
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
refer
it
to
my
reader
to
make
what
observation
he
please
on
this
incident
<EOS>
:
it
be
sufficient
for
me
to
inform
him
that
,
after
Adams
and
his
companion
have
return
him
a
thousand
thank
,
and
tell
him
where
he
may
call
to
be
repay
,
they
all
sally
out
of
the
house
without
any
compliment
from
their
hostess
,
or
indeed
without
pay
her
any
;
Adams
declare
he
would
take
particular
care
never
to
call
there
again
;
and
she
on
her
side
assure
them
she
want
no
such
guest
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
a
very
curious
adventure
,
in
which
Mr
Adams
give
a
much
great
instance
of
the
honest
simplicity
of
his
heart
,
than
of
his
experience
in
the
way
of
this
world
.
  
<EOS>
Our
traveller
have
walk
about
two
mile
from
that
inn
,
which
they
have
more
reason
to
have
mistake
for
a
castle
than
Don
Quixote
ever
have
any
of
those
in
which
he
sojourn
,
see
they
have
meet
with
such
difficulty
in
escape
out
of
its
wall
,
when
they
come
to
a
parish
,
and
beheld
a
sign
of
invitation
hang
out
.
<EOS>
a
gentleman
sit
smoake
a
pipe
at
the
door
,
of
whom
Adams
inquire
the
road
,
and
receive
so
courteous
and
oblige
an
answer
,
accompany
with
so
smile
a
countenance
,
that
the
good
parson
,
whose
heart
be
naturally
dispose
to
love
and
affection
,
begin
to
ask
several
other
question
;
particularly
the
name
of
the
parish
,
and
who
be
the
owner
of
a
large
house
whose
front
they
then
have
in
prospect
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
answer
as
obligingly
as
before
;
and
as
to
the
house
,
acquaint
him
it
be
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
then
proceed
in
the
follow
manner
:
"
Sir
,
I
presume
by
your
habit
you
be
a
clergyman
;
and
as
you
be
travel
on
foot
<EOS>
I
suppose
a
glass
of
good
beer
will
not
be
disagreeable
to
you
;
and
I
can
recommend
my
landlord
be
within
as
some
of
the
good
in
all
this
country
.
<EOS>
what
say
you
,
will
you
halt
a
little
and
let
us
take
a
pipe
together
?
<EOS>
there
be
no
well
tobacco
in
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
proposal
be
not
displease
to
Adams
,
who
have
allay
his
thirst
that
day
with
no
well
liquor
than
what
Mrs
Trulliber
's
cellar
have
produce
;
and
which
be
indeed
little
superior
,
either
in
richness
or
flavour
,
to
that
which
distil
from
those
grain
her
generous
husband
bestow
on
his
hog
.
<EOS>
have
,
therefore
,
abundantly
thank
the
gentleman
for
his
kind
invitation
,
and
bid
Joseph
and
Fanny
follow
him
,
he
enter
the
alehouse
,
where
a
large
loaf
and
cheese
and
a
pitcher
of
beer
,
which
truly
answer
the
character
give
of
it
,
be
set
before
them
,
the
three
traveller
fall
to
eating
,
with
appetite
infinitely
more
voracious
than
be
to
be
find
at
the
most
exquisite
eating
-
house
in
the
parish
of
St.
James
's
.
  
<EOS>
the
gentleman
express
great
delight
in
the
hearty
and
cheerful
behaviour
of
Adams
;
and
particularly
in
the
familiarity
with
which
he
converse
with
Joseph
and
Fanny
,
whom
he
often
call
his
child
;
a
term
he
explain
to
mean
no
more
than
his
parishioner
;
say
,
"
He
look
on
all
those
whom
God
have
intrust
to
his
care
to
stand
to
him
in
that
relation
.
"
<EOS>
the
gentleman
,
shake
him
by
the
hand
,
highly
applaud
those
sentiment
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
,
indeed
,
"
say
he
,
"
the
true
principle
of
a
christian
divine
;
and
I
heartily
wish
they
be
universal
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
I
be
sorry
to
say
the
parson
of
our
parish
,
instead
of
esteem
his
poor
parishioner
as
a
part
of
his
family
,
seem
rather
to
consider
them
as
not
of
the
same
specie
with
himself
.
<EOS>
He
seldom
speak
to
any
,
unless
some
few
of
the
rich
of
us
;
nay
,
indeed
,
he
will
not
move
his
hat
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
often
laugh
when
I
behold
him
on
sunday
strut
along
the
churchyard
like
a
turkey
-
cock
through
row
of
his
parishioner
,
who
bow
to
him
with
as
much
submission
,
and
be
as
unregarded
,
as
a
set
of
servile
courtier
by
the
proud
prince
in
Christendom
.
<EOS>
but
if
such
temporal
pride
be
ridiculous
,
surely
the
spiritual
be
odious
and
detestable
;
if
such
a
puffed
 
up
empty
human
bladder
,
strut
in
princely
robe
,
justly
move
one
's
derision
,
surely
in
the
habit
of
a
priest
it
must
raise
our
scorn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
doubtless
,
"
answer
Adams
,
"
your
opinion
be
right
;
but
I
hope
such
example
be
rare
.
<EOS>
the
clergy
whom
I
have
the
honour
to
know
maintain
a
different
behaviour
;
and
you
will
allow
me
,
sir
,
that
the
readiness
which
too
many
of
the
laity
show
to
contemn
the
order
may
be
one
reason
of
their
avoid
too
much
humility
.
"
<EOS>
"
very
true
,
indeed
,
"
say
the
gentleman
;
"
I
find
,
sir
,
you
be
a
man
of
excellent
sense
,
and
be
happy
in
this
opportunity
of
know
you
;
perhaps
our
accidental
meeting
may
not
be
disadvantageous
to
you
neither
.
<EOS>
at
present
I
shall
only
say
to
you
that
the
incumbent
of
this
living
be
old
and
infirm
,
and
that
it
be
in
my
gift
.
<EOS>
doctor
,
give
me
your
hand
;
and
assure
yourself
of
it
at
his
decease
.
"
<EOS>
Adams
tell
him
,
"
He
be
never
more
confounded
in
his
life
than
at
his
utter
incapacity
to
make
any
return
to
such
noble
and
unmerited
generosity
.
"
<EOS>
"
a
mere
trifle
,
sir
,
"
cry
the
gentleman
,
"
scarce
worth
your
acceptance
;
a
little
more
than
three
hundred
a
year
.
<EOS>
I
wish
it
be
double
the
value
for
your
sake
.
"
<EOS>
Adams
bow
,
and
cry
from
the
emotion
of
his
gratitude
;
when
the
other
ask
him
,
"
if
he
be
married
,
or
have
any
child
,
besides
those
in
the
spiritual
sense
he
have
mention
.
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
reply
the
parson
,
"
I
have
a
wife
and
six
at
your
service
.
"
<EOS>
"
that
be
unlucky
,
"
say
the
gentleman
;
"
for
I
would
otherwise
have
take
you
into
my
own
house
as
my
chaplain
;
however
,
I
have
another
in
the
parish
(
for
the
parsonage
-
house
be
not
good
enough
)
,
which
I
will
furnish
for
you
.
<EOS>
pray
,
do
your
wife
understand
a
dairy
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
profess
she
do
,
"
say
Adams
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
for
it
,
"
quoth
the
gentleman
;
"
I
would
have
give
you
half
-
a
-
dozen
cow
,
and
very
good
ground
to
have
maintain
them
.
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
Adams
,
in
an
ecstasy
,
"
you
be
too
liberal
;
indeed
you
be
.
"
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
,
"
cry
the
gentleman
:
"
<EOS>
I
esteem
rich
only
as
they
give
me
an
opportunity
of
do
good
;
and
I
never
see
one
whom
I
have
a
great
inclination
to
serve
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
at
which
word
he
shake
him
heartily
by
the
hand
,
and
tell
him
he
have
sufficient
room
in
his
house
to
entertain
him
and
his
friend
.
<EOS>
Adams
beg
he
may
give
him
no
such
trouble
;
that
they
could
be
very
well
accommodate
in
the
house
where
they
be
;
forget
they
have
not
a
sixpenny
piece
among
them
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
would
not
be
deny
;
and
,
inform
himself
how
far
they
be
travel
,
he
say
it
be
too
long
a
journey
to
take
on
foot
,
and
beg
that
they
would
favour
him
by
suffer
him
to
lend
them
a
servant
and
horse
;
add
,
withal
,
that
,
if
they
would
do
him
the
pleasure
of
their
company
only
two
day
,
he
would
furnish
them
with
his
coach
and
six
.
<EOS>
Adams
,
turn
to
Joseph
,
say
,
"
how
lucky
be
this
gentleman
's
goodness
to
you
,
who
I
be
afraid
would
be
scarce
able
to
hold
out
on
your
lame
leg
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
address
the
person
who
make
him
these
liberal
promise
,
after
much
bowing
,
he
cry
out
,
"
<EOS>
bless
be
the
hour
which
first
introduce
me
to
a
man
of
your
charity
!
<EOS>
you
be
indeed
a
Christian
of
the
true
primitive
kind
,
and
an
honour
to
the
country
wherein
you
live
.
<EOS>
I
would
willingly
have
take
a
pilgrimage
to
the
Holy
Land
to
have
behold
you
;
for
the
advantage
which
we
draw
from
your
goodness
give
me
little
pleasure
,
in
comparison
of
what
I
enjoy
for
your
own
sake
when
I
consider
the
treasure
you
be
by
these
mean
lay
up
for
yourself
in
a
country
that
passeth
not
away
.
<EOS>
We
will
therefore
,
most
generous
sir
,
accept
your
goodness
,
as
well
the
entertainment
you
have
so
kindly
offer
us
at
your
house
this
evening
,
as
the
accommodation
of
your
horse
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
then
begin
to
search
for
his
hat
,
as
do
Joseph
for
his
;
and
both
they
and
Fanny
be
in
order
of
departure
,
when
the
gentleman
,
stop
short
,
and
seem
to
meditate
by
himself
for
the
space
of
about
a
minute
,
exclaim
thus
:
"
<EOS>
sure
never
anything
be
so
unlucky
<EOS>
;
I
have
forget
that
my
house
-
keeper
be
go
abroad
,
and
hath
lock
up
all
my
room
;
indeed
,
I
would
break
them
open
for
you
,
but
shall
not
be
able
to
furnish
you
with
a
bed
;
for
she
have
likewise
put
away
all
my
linen
.
<EOS>
I
be
glad
it
enter
into
my
head
before
I
have
give
you
the
trouble
of
walk
there
;
besides
,
I
believe
you
will
find
well
accommodation
here
than
you
expect
.
 
<EOS>
Landlord
,
you
can
provide
good
bed
for
these
people
,
can
not
you
?
"
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
and
please
your
worship
,
"
cry
the
host
,
"
and
such
as
no
lord
or
justice
of
the
peace
in
the
kingdom
nee
be
ashamed
to
lie
in
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
be
heartily
sorry
,
"
say
the
gentleman
,
"
for
this
disappointment
.
<EOS>
I
be
resolve
I
will
never
suffer
her
to
carry
away
the
key
again
.
"
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
sir
,
let
it
not
make
you
uneasy
,
"
cry
Adams
;
"
we
shall
do
very
well
here
;
and
the
loan
of
your
horse
be
a
favour
we
shall
be
incapable
of
make
any
return
to
.
"
<EOS>
"
ay
!
"
say
the
squire
,
"
<EOS>
the
horse
shall
attend
you
here
at
what
hour
in
the
morning
you
please
;
"
and
now
,
after
many
civility
too
tedious
to
enumerate
,
many
squeeze
by
the
hand
,
with
most
affectionate
look
and
smile
at
each
other
,
and
after
appoint
the
horse
at
seven
the
next
morning
,
the
gentleman
take
his
leave
of
them
,
and
depart
to
his
own
house
.
<EOS>
Adams
and
his
companion
return
to
the
table
,
where
the
parson
smoake
another
pipe
,
and
then
they
all
retire
to
rest
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Adams
rise
very
early
,
and
call
Joseph
out
of
his
bed
,
between
whom
a
very
fierce
dispute
ensue
,
whether
Fanny
should
ride
behind
Joseph
,
or
behind
the
gentleman
's
servant
;
<EOS>
Joseph
insist
on
it
that
he
be
perfectly
recover
,
and
be
as
capable
of
take
care
of
Fanny
as
any
other
person
could
be
.
<EOS>
but
Adams
would
not
agree
to
it
,
and
declare
he
would
not
trust
her
behind
him
;
for
that
he
be
weak
than
he
imagine
himself
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
this
dispute
continue
a
long
time
,
and
have
begin
to
be
very
hot
,
when
a
servant
arrive
from
their
good
friend
,
to
acquaint
them
that
he
be
unfortunately
prevent
from
lend
them
any
horse
;
for
that
his
groom
have
,
unknown
to
him
,
put
his
whole
stable
under
a
course
of
physic
.
  
<EOS>
this
advice
presently
strike
the
two
disputant
dumb
:
Adams
cry
out
,
"
be
ever
anything
so
unlucky
as
this
poor
gentleman
?
<EOS>
I
protest
I
be
more
sorry
on
his
account
than
my
own
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
Joseph
,
how
this
good
-
natured
man
be
treat
by
his
servant
;
one
lock
up
his
linen
,
another
physics
his
horse
,
and
I
suppose
,
by
his
being
at
this
house
last
night
,
the
butler
have
lock
up
his
cellar
.
<EOS>
bless
us
!
<EOS>
how
good
-
nature
be
use
in
this
world
!
<EOS>
I
protest
I
be
more
concerned
on
his
account
than
my
own
.
"
<EOS>
"
so
be
not
I
,
"
cry
Joseph
;
"
not
that
I
be
much
troubled
about
walk
on
foot
;
all
my
concern
be
,
how
we
shall
get
out
of
the
house
,
unless
God
send
another
pedlar
to
redeem
us
.
<EOS>
but
certainly
this
gentleman
have
such
an
affection
for
you
,
that
he
would
lend
you
a
large
sum
than
we
owe
here
,
which
be
not
above
four
or
five
shilling
.
"
<EOS>
"
very
true
,
child
,
"
answer
Adams
;
"
I
will
write
a
letter
to
him
,
and
will
even
venture
to
solicit
him
for
three
half
-
crown
;
there
will
be
no
harm
in
have
two
or
three
shilling
in
our
pocket
;
as
we
have
full
forty
mile
to
travel
,
we
may
possibly
have
occasion
for
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
be
now
rise
,
Joseph
pay
her
a
visit
,
and
leave
Adams
to
write
his
letter
,
which
have
finish
,
he
despatch
a
boy
with
it
to
the
gentleman
,
and
then
seat
himself
by
the
door
,
light
his
pipe
,
and
betook
himself
to
meditation
.
  
<EOS>
the
boy
stay
longer
than
seem
to
be
necessary
,
Joseph
,
who
with
Fanny
be
now
return
to
the
parson
,
express
some
apprehension
that
the
gentleman
's
steward
have
lock
up
his
purse
too
.
<EOS>
to
which
Adams
answer
,
"
It
may
very
possibly
be
,
and
he
should
wonder
at
no
liberty
which
the
devil
may
put
into
the
head
of
a
wicked
servant
to
take
with
so
worthy
a
master
;
"
but
add
,
"
that
,
as
the
sum
be
so
small
,
so
noble
a
gentleman
would
be
easily
able
to
procure
it
in
the
parish
,
though
he
have
it
not
in
his
own
pocket
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
"
say
he
,
"
if
it
be
four
or
five
guinea
,
or
any
such
large
quantity
of
money
,
it
may
be
a
different
matter
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
be
now
sit
down
to
breakfast
over
some
toast
and
ale
,
when
the
boy
return
and
inform
them
that
the
gentleman
be
not
at
home
.
"
<EOS>
very
well
!
"
cry
Adams
;
"
but
why
,
child
,
do
you
not
stay
till
his
return
?
<EOS>
go
back
again
,
my
good
boy
,
and
wait
for
his
come
home
;
he
can
not
be
go
far
,
as
his
horse
be
all
sick
;
and
besides
,
he
have
no
intention
to
go
abroad
,
for
he
invite
us
to
spend
this
day
and
tomorrow
at
his
house
.
<EOS>
therefore
go
back
,
child
,
and
tarry
till
his
return
home
.
<EOS>
"
the
messenger
depart
,
and
be
back
again
with
great
expedition
,
bring
an
account
that
the
gentleman
be
go
a
long
journey
,
and
would
not
be
at
home
again
this
month
.
<EOS>
at
these
word
Adams
seem
greatly
confound
,
say
,
"
this
must
be
a
sudden
accident
,
as
the
sickness
or
death
of
a
relation
or
some
such
unforeseen
misfortune
;
"
and
then
,
turn
to
Joseph
,
cry
,
"
I
wish
you
have
remind
me
to
have
borrow
this
money
last
night
.
"
<EOS>
Joseph
,
smile
,
answer
,
"
He
be
very
much
deceive
if
the
gentleman
would
not
have
find
some
excuse
to
avoid
lend
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
own
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
I
be
never
much
pleased
with
his
professing
so
much
kindness
for
you
at
first
sight
;
for
I
have
hear
the
gentleman
of
our
cloth
in
London
tell
many
such
story
of
their
master
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
boy
bring
the
message
back
of
his
not
be
at
home
,
I
presently
know
what
would
follow
;
for
,
whenever
a
man
of
fashion
doth
not
care
to
fulfil
his
promise
,
the
custom
be
to
order
his
servant
that
he
will
never
be
at
home
to
the
person
so
promise
.
<EOS>
in
London
they
call
it
deny
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
myself
deny
Sir
Thomas
Booby
above
a
hundred
time
,
and
when
the
man
hath
dance
attendance
for
about
a
month
or
sometimes
longer
,
he
be
acquaint
in
the
end
that
the
gentleman
be
go
out
of
town
and
could
do
nothing
in
the
business
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Good
Lord
!
<EOS>
"
say
Adams
,
"
what
wickedness
be
there
in
the
christian
world
!
<EOS>
I
profess
almost
equal
to
what
I
have
read
of
the
heathen
.
<EOS>
but
surely
,
Joseph
,
your
suspicion
of
this
gentleman
must
be
unjust
,
for
what
a
silly
fellow
must
he
be
who
would
do
the
devil
's
work
for
nothing
!
<EOS>
and
canst
thou
tell
me
any
interest
he
could
possibly
propose
to
himself
by
deceive
us
in
his
profession
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
for
me
,
"
answer
Joseph
,
"
to
give
reason
for
what
man
do
,
to
a
gentleman
of
your
learning
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
say
right
,
"
quoth
Adams
;
"
knowledge
of
man
be
only
to
be
learn
from
book
;
Plato
and
Seneca
for
that
;
and
those
be
author
,
I
be
afraid
,
child
,
you
never
read
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
I
,
sir
,
truly
,
"
answer
Joseph
;
"
all
I
know
be
,
it
be
a
maxim
among
the
gentleman
of
our
cloth
,
that
those
master
who
promise
the
most
perform
the
least
;
and
I
have
often
hear
them
say
they
have
find
the
large
vail
in
those
family
where
they
be
not
promise
any
.
<EOS>
but
,
sir
,
instead
of
consider
any
farther
<EOS>
these
matter
,
it
would
be
our
wise
way
to
contrive
some
method
of
get
out
of
this
house
;
for
the
generous
gentleman
,
instead
of
do
us
any
service
,
hath
leave
us
the
whole
reckon
to
pay
.
<EOS>
"
Adams
be
go
to
answer
,
when
their
host
come
in
,
and
,
with
a
kind
of
jeer
smile
,
say
,
"
well
,
master
!
<EOS>
the
squire
hath
not
send
his
horse
for
you
yet
.
<EOS>
Laud
help
me
!
<EOS>
how
easily
some
folk
make
promise
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
!
"
say
Adams
;
"
have
you
ever
know
him
do
anything
of
this
kind
before
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
!
marry
have
I
,
"
answer
the
host
:
"
it
be
no
business
of
mine
,
you
know
,
sir
,
to
say
anything
to
a
gentleman
to
his
face
;
but
now
he
be
not
here
,
I
will
assure
you
,
he
hath
not
his
fellow
within
the
three
next
market
-
town
.
<EOS>
I
own
I
could
not
help
laugh
when
I
hear
him
offer
you
the
living
,
for
thereby
hang
a
good
jest
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
would
have
offer
you
my
house
next
,
for
one
be
no
more
his
to
dispose
of
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
at
these
word
Adams
,
bless
himself
,
declare
,
"
He
have
never
read
of
such
a
monster
.
<EOS>
but
what
vex
me
most
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
,
that
he
hath
decoy
us
into
run
up
a
long
debt
with
you
,
which
we
be
not
able
to
pay
,
for
we
have
no
money
about
us
,
and
<EOS>
,
what
be
bad
,
live
at
such
a
distance
,
that
if
you
should
trust
us
,
I
be
afraid
you
would
lose
your
money
for
want
of
our
find
any
conveniency
of
send
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
trust
you
,
master
!
"
say
the
host
,
"
that
I
will
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
honour
the
clergy
too
much
to
deny
trust
one
of
them
for
such
a
trifle
;
besides
,
I
like
your
fear
of
never
pay
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
lose
many
a
debt
in
my
lifetime
,
but
be
promise
to
be
pay
them
all
in
a
very
short
time
.
<EOS>
I
will
score
this
reckon
for
the
novelty
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
,
I
do
assure
you
,
of
its
kind
.
<EOS>
but
what
say
you
,
master
,
shall
we
have
t'other
pot
before
we
part
?
<EOS>
It
will
waste
but
a
little
chalk
more
,
and
if
you
never
pay
me
a
shill
the
loss
will
not
ruin
me
.
"
<EOS>
Adams
like
the
invitation
very
well
,
especially
as
it
be
deliver
with
so
hearty
an
accent
.
<EOS>
He
shake
his
host
by
the
hand
,
and
thank
him
,
say
,
"
He
would
tarry
another
pot
rather
for
the
pleasure
of
such
worthy
company
than
for
the
liquor
;
"
add
,
"
he
be
glad
to
find
some
Christians
leave
in
the
kingdom
,
for
that
he
almost
begin
to
suspect
that
he
be
sojourn
in
a
country
inhabit
only
by
Jews
and
Turks
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
kind
host
produce
the
liquor
,
and
Joseph
with
Fanny
retire
into
the
garden
,
where
,
while
they
solace
themselves
with
amorous
discourse
,
Adams
sit
down
with
his
host
;
and
,
both
fill
their
glass
,
and
light
their
pipe
,
they
begin
that
dialogue
which
the
reader
will
find
in
the
next
chapter
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
a
dialogue
between
Mr
Abraham
Adams
and
his
host
,
which
,
by
the
disagreement
in
their
opinion
,
seem
to
threaten
an
unlucky
catastrophe
,
have
it
not
be
timely
prevent
by
the
return
of
the
lover
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
the
host
,
"
I
assure
you
you
be
not
the
first
to
whom
our
squire
hath
promise
more
than
he
hath
perform
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
famous
for
this
practice
,
that
his
word
will
not
be
take
for
much
by
those
who
know
him
.
<EOS>
I
remember
a
young
fellow
whom
he
promise
his
parent
to
make
an
exciseman
.
<EOS>
the
poor
people
,
who
could
ill
afford
it
,
breed
their
son
to
writing
and
account
,
and
other
learn
to
qualify
him
for
the
place
;
and
the
boy
hold
up
his
head
above
his
condition
with
these
hope
;
nor
would
he
go
to
plough
,
nor
to
any
other
kind
of
work
,
and
go
constantly
dr
as
fine
as
could
be
,
with
two
clean
Holland
shirt
a
week
,
and
this
for
several
year
;
till
at
last
he
follow
the
squire
up
to
London
,
think
there
to
mind
him
of
his
promise
;
but
he
could
never
get
sight
of
him
.
<EOS>
so
that
,
be
out
of
money
and
business
,
he
fall
into
evil
company
and
wicked
course
;
and
in
the
end
come
to
a
sentence
of
transportation
,
the
news
of
which
break
the
mother
's
heart
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
another
true
story
of
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
neighbour
of
mine
,
a
farmer
,
who
have
two
son
whom
he
breed
up
to
the
business
.
<EOS>
pretty
lad
they
be
.
<EOS>
nothing
would
serve
the
squire
but
that
the
young
must
be
make
a
parson
.
<EOS>
upon
which
he
persuade
the
father
to
send
him
to
school
,
promise
that
he
would
afterwards
maintain
him
at
the
university
,
and
,
when
he
be
of
a
proper
age
,
give
him
a
living
.
<EOS>
but
after
the
lad
have
be
seven
year
at
school
,
and
his
father
bring
him
to
the
squire
,
with
a
letter
from
his
master
that
he
be
fit
for
the
university
,
the
squire
,
instead
of
mind
his
promise
,
or
send
him
thither
at
his
expense
,
only
tell
his
father
that
the
young
man
be
a
fine
scholar
,
and
it
be
pity
he
could
not
afford
to
keep
him
at
Oxford
for
four
or
five
year
more
,
by
which
time
,
if
he
could
get
him
a
curacy
,
he
may
have
him
ordain
.
<EOS>
the
farmer
say
,
"
He
be
not
a
man
sufficient
to
do
any
such
thing
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
then
,
"
answer
the
squire
,
"
I
be
very
sorry
you
have
give
him
so
much
learning
;
for
,
if
he
can
not
get
his
living
by
that
,
it
will
rather
spoil
him
for
anything
else
;
and
your
other
son
,
who
can
hardly
write
his
name
,
will
do
more
at
plough
and
sow
,
and
be
in
a
well
condition
,
than
he
.
"
<EOS>
and
indeed
so
it
prove
;
for
the
poor
lad
,
not
find
friend
to
maintain
him
in
his
learning
,
as
he
have
expect
,
and
be
unwilling
to
work
,
fall
to
drinking
,
though
he
be
a
very
sober
lad
before
;
and
in
a
short
time
,
partly
with
grief
,
and
partly
with
good
liquor
,
fall
into
a
consumption
,
and
die
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
can
tell
you
more
still
:
there
be
another
,
a
young
woman
,
and
the
handsome
in
all
this
neighbourhood
,
whom
he
entice
up
to
London
,
promise
to
make
her
a
gentlewoman
to
one
of
your
woman
of
quality
;
but
,
instead
of
keep
his
word
,
we
have
since
hear
,
after
have
a
child
by
her
himself
,
she
become
a
common
whore
;
then
keep
a
coffeehouse
in
Covent
Garden
;
and
a
little
after
die
of
the
french
distemper
in
a
gaol
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
tell
you
many
more
story
;
but
how
do
you
imagine
he
serve
me
myself
?
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
sir
,
I
be
breed
a
seafare
man
,
and
have
be
many
voyage
;
till
at
last
I
come
to
be
master
of
a
ship
myself
,
and
be
in
a
fair
way
of
make
a
fortune
,
when
I
be
attack
by
one
of
those
curse
guarda
-
costa
who
take
our
ship
before
the
beginning
of
the
war
;
and
after
a
fight
,
wherein
I
lose
the
great
part
of
my
crew
,
my
rigging
be
all
demolish
,
and
two
shot
receive
between
wind
and
water
,
I
be
force
to
strike
.
<EOS>
the
villain
carry
off
my
ship
,
a
brigantine
of
150
ton
 
a
pretty
creature
she
be
 
and
put
me
,
a
man
,
and
a
boy
,
into
a
little
bad
pink
,
in
which
,
with
much
ado
,
we
at
last
make
Falmouth
;
though
I
believe
the
Spaniards
do
not
imagine
she
could
possibly
live
a
day
at
sea
.
<EOS>
upon
my
return
hither
,
where
my
wife
,
who
be
of
this
country
,
then
live
,
the
squire
tell
me
he
be
so
pleased
with
the
defence
I
have
make
against
the
enemy
,
that
he
do
not
fear
get
me
promote
to
a
lieutenancy
of
a
man
-
of
-
war
,
if
I
would
accept
of
it
;
which
I
thankfully
assure
him
I
would
.
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
two
or
three
year
pass
,
during
which
I
have
many
repeat
promise
,
not
only
from
the
squire
,
but
(
as
he
tell
me
)
from
the
lord
of
the
admiralty
.
<EOS>
He
never
return
from
London
<EOS>
but
I
be
assure
I
may
be
satisfied
now
,
for
I
be
certain
of
the
first
vacancy
;
and
,
what
surprize
me
still
,
when
I
reflect
on
it
,
these
assurance
be
give
me
with
no
less
confidence
,
after
so
many
disappointment
,
than
at
first
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
sir
,
grow
weary
,
and
somewhat
suspicious
,
after
so
much
delay
,
I
write
to
a
friend
in
London
,
who
I
know
have
some
acquaintance
at
the
good
house
in
the
admiralty
,
and
desire
him
to
back
the
squire
's
interest
;
for
indeed
I
fear
he
have
solicit
the
affair
with
more
coldness
than
he
pretend
.
<EOS>
and
what
answer
do
you
think
my
friend
send
me
?
<EOS>
truly
,
sir
,
he
acquaint
me
that
the
squire
have
never
mention
my
name
at
the
admiralty
in
his
life
;
and
,
unless
I
have
much
faithfuller
interest
,
advise
me
to
give
over
my
pretension
;
which
I
immediately
do
,
and
,
with
the
concurrence
of
my
wife
,
resolve
to
set
up
an
alehouse
,
where
you
be
heartily
welcome
;
and
so
my
service
to
you
;
and
may
the
squire
,
and
all
such
sneak
rascal
,
go
to
the
devil
together
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
o
fie

say
Adams
,
"
o

<EOS>
He
be
indeed
a
wicked
man
;
but
g
#
#
#
#
will
,
I
hope
,
turn
his
heart
to
repentance
.
<EOS>
nay
,
if
he
could
but
once
see
the
meanness
of
this
detestable
vice
;
would
he
but
once
reflect
that
he
be
one
of
the
most
scandalous
as
well
as
pernicious
lyar
;
sure
he
must
despise
himself
to
so
intolerable
a
degree
,
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
continue
a
moment
in
such
a
course
.
<EOS>
and
to
confess
the
truth
,
notwithstanding
the
baseness
of
this
character
,
which
he
hath
too
well
deserved
,
he
hath
in
his
countenance
sufficient
symptom
of
that
bona
indole
,
that
sweetness
of
disposition
,
which
furnish
out
a
good
Christian
.
<EOS>
"

I
would
look
there

He
speak
this
with
so
little
regard
to
the

's
observation

that
it
a
good
deal
nettle
him
;
and
,
take
the
pipe
hastily
from
his
mouth
,
he
thus
answer
:
"
Master
of
mine
,
perhaps
I
have
travel
a
great
deal
farther
than
you

of

you

no

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
I
can
go
farther
in

afternoon
than
you
in

<EOS>
what
,
I
suppose
you
have
see
the
Pillars
of
Hercules
,
and
perhaps
the
wall
of
Carthage
.
<EOS>
nay
,
you
may
have
hear
Scylla

and
see
Charybdis
;
you
may
have
enter
the
closet
where
Archimedes
be
find
at
the
taking
of
Syracuse

<EOS>
I
suppose
you
have
sail
among
the
Cyclades
,
and
pass
the
famous
strait
which
take
their
name
from
the
unfortunate
Helle
,
whose
fate

sweetly

Apollonius

not

you
be

<EOS>
My

you

<EOS>
you
must
not

us
the
traveller

it

<EOS>
"
since
thou
art
so
dull
to
misunderstand
me
still

"
quoth
Adams
,
"
I
will
inform
thee
;
the
travel
I
mean
be
in
book
,
the
only
way
of
travel
by
which
any
knowledge
be
to
be
acquire
.
<EOS>
from
them
I
learn
what
I
assert
just
now
,
that
nature
generally
imprint
such
a
portraiture
of
the
mind
in
the
countenance
,
that
a
skilful
physiognomist
will
rarely
be
deceive
.
<EOS>
I
presume
you
have
never
read
the
story
of
Socrates
to
this
purpose
,
and
therefore
I
will
tell
it
you
.
<EOS>
a
certain
physiognomist
assert
of
Socrates
,
that
he
plainly
discover
by
his
feature
that
he
be
a
rogue
in
his
nature
.
<EOS>
a
character
so
contrary
to
the
tenour
of
all
this
great
man
's
action
,
and
the
generally
receive
opinion
concern
him
,
incense
the
boy
of
Athens
so
that
they
throw
stone
at
the
physiognomist
,
and
would
have
demolish
him
for
his
ignorance
,
have
not
Socrates
himself
prevent
them
by
confess
the
truth
of
his
observation
,
and
acknowledge
that
,
though
he
correct
his
disposition
by
philosophy
,
he
be
indeed
naturally
as
incline
to
vice
as
have
be
predicate
of
him
.
<EOS>
now
,
pray
resolve
me
 
how
should
a
man
know
this
story
if
he
have
not
read
it

"
<EOS>

well

the

what
signify
it
whether
a

<EOS>
He
who
go
abroad
,
as
I
have
do
,
will
always
have
opportunity
enough
of
know
the
world
without

his

silence
ask
him

You
should

the
extravagancy
of

reply
the
parson

admit
they

BOOK
III
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
matter
prefatory
in
praise
of
biography
.
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
preference
which
may
be
vulgarly
give
to
the
authority
of
those
romance
writer
who
entitle
their
book
<EOS>
"
the
History
of
England
,
the
history
of
France
,
of
Spain
,
&
c.
<EOS>
,
"
it
be
most
certain
that
truth
be
to
be
find
only
in
the
work
of
those
who
celebrate
the
life
of
great
man
,
and
be
commonly
call
biographer
,
as
the
other
should
indeed
be
term
topographer
,
or
chorographer
;
word
which
may
well
mark
the
distinction
between
them
;
it
be
the
business
of
the
latter
chiefly
to
describe
country
and
city
,
which
,
with
the
assistance
of
map
,
they
do
pretty
justly
,
and
may
be
depend
upon
;
but
as
to
the
action
and
character
of
man
,
their
writing
be
not
quite
so
authentic
,
of
which
there
need
no
other
proof
than
those
eternal
contradiction
occur
between
two
topographer
who
undertake
the
history
of
the
same
country
:
for
instance
,
between
my
Lord
Clarendon
and
Mr
Whitelocke
,
between
Mr
Echard
and
Rapin
,
and
many
other
;
where
,
fact
be
set
forth
in
a
different
light
,
every
reader
believe
as
he
please
;
and
,
indeed
,
the
more
judicious
and
suspicious
very
justly
esteem
the
whole
as
no
other
than
a
romance
,
in
which
the
writer
hath
indulge
a
happy
and
fertile
invention
.
<EOS>
but
though
these
widely
differ
in
the
narrative
of
fact
;
some
ascribe
victory
to
the
one
,
and
other
to
the
other
party
;
some
represent
the
same
man
as
a
rogue
,
while
other
give
him
a
great
and
honest
character
;
yet
all
agree
in
the
scene
where
the
fact
be
suppose
to
have
happen
,
and
where
the
person
,
who
be
both
a
rogue
and
an
honest
man
,
live
.
<EOS>
now
with
us
biographer
the
case
be
different
;
the
fact
we
deliver
may
be
rely
on
,
though
we
often
mistake
the
age
and
country
wherein
they
happen
:
for
,
though
it
may
be
worth
the
examination
of
critic
,
whether
the
shepherd
Chrysostom
,
who
,
as
Cervantes
inform
us
,
die
for
love
of
the
fair
Marcella
,
who
hate
him
,
be
ever
in
Spain
,
<EOS>
will
any
one
doubt
but
that
such
a
silly
fellow
hath
really
exist
?
<EOS>
be
there
in
the
world
such
a
sceptic
as
to
disbelieve
the
madness
of
Cardenio
,
the
perfidy
of
Ferdinand
,
the
impertinent
curiosity
of
Anselmo
,
the
weakness
of
Camilla
,
the
irresolute
friendship
of
Lothario
?
<EOS>
though
perhaps
,
as
to
the
time
and
place
where
those
several
person
live
,
that
good
historian
may
be
deplorably
deficient
.
<EOS>
but
the
most
know
instance
of
this
kind
be
in
the
true
history
of
Gil
Blas
,
where
the
inimitable
biographer
hath
make
a
notorious
blunder
in
the
country
of
Dr
Sangrado
,
who
use
his
patient
as
a
vintner
doth
his
wine
-
vessel
,
by
let
out
their
blood
,
and
fill
them
up
with
water
.
<EOS>
Doth
not
every
one
,
who
be
the
least
verse
in
physical
history
,
know
that
Spain
be
not
the
country
in
which
this
doctor
live
?
<EOS>
the
same
writer
hath
likewise
err
in
the
country
of
his
archbishop
,
as
well
as
that
of
those
great
personage
whose
understanding
be
too
sublime
to
taste
anything
but
tragedy
,
and
in
many
other
.
<EOS>
the
same
mistake
may
likewise
be
observe
in
Scarron
,
the
Arabian
Nights
,
the
history
of
Marianne
and
le
Paisan
Parvenu
,
and
perhaps
some
few
other
writer
of
this
class
,
whom
I
have
not
read
,
or
do
not
at
present
recollect
;
for
I
would
by
no
means
be
think
to
comprehend
those
person
of
surprize
genius
,
the
author
of
immense
romance
,
or
the
modern
novel
and
atalantis
writer
;
who
,
without
any
assistance
from
nature
or
history
,
record
person
who
never
be
,
or
will
be
,
and
fact
which
never
do
,
nor
possibly
can
,
happen
;
whose
hero
be
of
their
own
creation
,
and
their
brain
the
chaos
whence
all
their
material
be
select
.
<EOS>
not
that
such
writer
deserve
no
honour
;
so
far
otherwise
,
that
perhaps
they
merit
the
high
;
for
what
can
be
noble
than
to
be
as
an
example
of
the
wonderful
extent
of
human
genius
?
<EOS>
one
may
apply
to
them
what
Balzac
say
of
Aristotle
,
that
they
be
a
second
nature
(
for
they
have
no
communication
with
the
first
;
by
which
,
author
of
an
inferior
class
,
who
can
not
stand
alone
,
be
oblige
to
support
themselves
as
with
crutch
)
;
but
these
of
whom
I
be
now
speak
seem
to
be
possess
of
those
stilt
,
which
the
excellent
Voltaire
tell
us
,
in
his
letter
,
"
carry
the
genius
far
off
,
but
with
an
regular
pace
.
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
far
out
of
the
sight
of
the
reader
,
      
beyond
the
realm
of
Chaos
and
old
night
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
the
former
class
,
who
be
content
to
copy
nature
,
instead
of
form
original
from
the
confused
heap
of
matter
in
their
own
brain
,
be
not
such
a
book
as
that
which
record
the
achievement
of
the
renowned
Don
Quixote
more
worthy
the
name
of
a
history
than
even
Mariana
's
:
for
,
whereas
the
latter
be
confine
to
a
particular
period
of
time
,
and
to
a
particular
nation
,
the
former
be
the
history
of
the
world
in
general
,
at
least
that
part
which
be
polish
by
law
,
art
,
and
science
;
and
of
that
from
the
time
it
be
first
polished
to
this
day
;
nay
,
and
forwards
as
long
as
it
shall
so
remain
?
  
<EOS>
I
shall
now
proceed
to
apply
these
observation
to
the
work
before
us
;
for
indeed
I
have
set
them
down
principally
to
obviate
some
construction
which
the
good
nature
of
mankind
,
who
be
always
forward
to
see
their
friend
'
virtue
record
,
may
put
to
particular
part
.
<EOS>
I
question
not
but
several
of
my
reader
will
know
the
lawyer
in
the
stage
-
coach
the
moment
they
hear
his
voice
.
<EOS>
It
be
likewise
odd
but
<EOS>
the
wit
and
the
prude
meet
with
some
of
their
acquaintance
,
as
well
as
all
the
rest
of
my
character
.
<EOS>
to
prevent
,
therefore
,
any
such
malicious
application
,
I
declare
here
,
once
for
all
,
I
describe
not
man
,
but
manner
;
not
an
individual
,
but
a
species
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
will
be
answer
,
be
not
the
character
then
take
from
life
?
<EOS>
to
which
I
answer
in
the
affirmative
;
nay
,
I
believe
I
may
aver
that
I
have
writ
little
more
than
I
have
see
.
<EOS>
the
lawyer
be
not
only
alive
,
but
hath
be
so
these
four
thousand
year
;
and
I
hope
G
#
#
#
#
will
indulge
his
life
as
many
yet
to
come
.
<EOS>
He
hath
not
indeed
confine
himself
to
one
profession
,
one
religion
,
or
one
country
;
but
when
the
first
mean
selfish
creature
appear
on
the
human
stage
,
who
make
self
the
centre
of
the
whole
creation
,
would
give
himself
no
pain
,
incur
no
danger
,
advance
no
money
,
to
assist
or
preserve
his
fellow
-
creature
;
then
be
our
lawyer
bear
;
and
,
whilst
such
a
person
as
I
have
describe
exist
on
earth
,
so
long
shall
he
remain
upon
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
therefore
,
do
him
little
honour
to
imagine
he
endeavour
to
mimick
some
little
obscure
fellow
,
because
he
happen
to
resemble
him
in
one
particular
feature
,
or
perhaps
in
his
profession
;
whereas
his
appearance
in
the
world
be
calculate
for
much
more
general
and
noble
purpose
;
not
to
expose
one
pitiful
wretch
to
the
small
and
contemptible
circle
of
his
acquaintance
;
but
to
hold
the
glass
to
thousand
in
their
closet
,
that
they
may
contemplate
their
deformity
,
and
endeavour
to
reduce
it
,
and
thus
by
suffer
private
mortification
may
avoid
public
shame
.
<EOS>
this
place
the
boundary
between
,
and
distinguish
the
satirist
from
the
libeller
:
for
the
former
privately
correct
the
fault
for
the
benefit
of
the
person
,
like
a
parent
;
the
latter
publickly
expose
the
person
himself
,
as
an
example
to
other
,
like
an
executioner
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
besides
little
circumstance
to
be
consider
;
as
the
drapery
of
a
picture
,
which
though
fashion
vary
at
different
time
,
the
resemblance
of
the
countenance
be
not
by
those
mean
diminish
.
<EOS>
thus
I
believe
we
may
venture
to
say
Mrs
Tow
-
wouse
be
coeval
with
our
lawyer
:
and
,
though
perhaps
,
during
the
change
which
so
long
an
existence
must
have
pass
through
,
she
may
in
her
turn
have
stand
behind
the
bar
at
an
inn
,
I
will
not
scruple
to
affirm
she
hath
likewise
in
the
revolution
of
age
<EOS>
sit
on
a
throne
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
where
extreme
turbulency
of
temper
,
avarice
,
and
an
insensibility
of
human
misery
,
with
a
degree
of
hypocrisy
,
have
unite
in
a
female
composition
,
Mrs
Tow
-
wouse
be
that
woman
;
and
where
a
good
inclination
,
eclipse
by
a
poverty
of
spirit
and
understanding
,
hath
glimmer
forth
in
a
man
,
that
man
hath
be
no
other
than
her
sneak
husband
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
detain
my
reader
no
longer
than
to
give
him
one
caution
more
of
an
opposite
kind
:
for
,
as
in
most
of
our
particular
character
we
mean
not
to
lash
individual
,
but
all
of
the
like
sort
,
so
,
in
our
general
description
,
we
mean
not
universal
,
but
would
be
understand
with
many
exception
:
for
instance
,
in
our
description
of
high
people
,
we
can
not
be
intend
to
include
such
as
,
whilst
they
be
an
honour
to
their
high
rank
,
by
a
well
-
guide
condescension
<EOS>
make
their
superiority
as
easy
as
possible
to
those
whom
fortune
chiefly
hath
place
below
them
.
<EOS>
of
this
number
I
could
name
a
peer
no
less
elevated
by
nature
than
by
fortune
;
who
,
whilst
he
wear
the
noble
ensign
of
honour
on
his
person
,
bear
the
true
stamp
of
dignity
on
his
mind
,
adorn
with
greatness
,
enrich
with
knowledge
,
and
embellish
with
genius
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
this
man
relieve
with
generosity
,
while
he
hath
converse
with
freedom
,
and
be
to
the
same
person
a
patron
and
a
companion
.
<EOS>
I
could
name
a
commoner
,
raise
higher
above
the
multitude
by
superior
talent
than
be
in
the
power
of
his
prince
to
exalt
him
,
whose
behaviour
to
those
he
hath
oblige
be
more
amiable
than
the
obligation
itself
;
and
who
be
so
great
a
master
of
affability
,
that
,
if
he
could
divest
himself
of
an
inherent
greatness
in
his
manner
,
would
often
make
the
low
of
his
acquaintance
forget
who
be
the
master
of
that
palace
in
which
they
be
so
courteously
entertain
.
<EOS>
these
be
picture
which
must
be
,
I
believe
,
know
:
<EOS>
I
declare
they
be
take
from
the
life
,
and
not
intend
to
exceed
it
.
<EOS>
by
those
high
people
,
therefore
,
whom
I
have
describe
,
I
mean
a
set
of
wretch
,
who
,
while
they
be
a
disgrace
to
their
ancestor
,
whose
honour
and
fortune
they
inherit
(
or
perhaps
a
great
to
their
mother
,
for
such
degeneracy
be
scarce
credible
)
,
have
the
insolence
to
treat
those
with
disregard
who
be
at
least
equal
to
the
founder
of
their
own
splendor
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
I
fancy
,
impossible
to
conceive
a
spectacle
more
worthy
of
our
indignation
,
than
that
of
a
fellow
,
who
be
not
only
a
blot
in
the
escutcheon
of
a
great
family
,
but
a
scandal
to
the
human
specie
,
maintain
a
supercilious
behaviour
to
man
who
be
an
honour
to
their
nature
and
a
disgrace
to
their
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
reader
,
take
these
hint
along
with
you
,
you
may
,
if
you
please
,
proceed
to
the
sequel
of
this
our
true
history
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
a
night
scene
,
wherein
several
wonderful
adventure
befel
Adams
and
his
fellow
-
traveller
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
so
late
when
our
traveller
leave
the
inn
or
alehouse
(
for
it
may
be
call
either
)
,
that
they
have
not
travel
many
mile
before
night
overtook
them
,
or
meet
them
,
which
you
please
.
<EOS>
the
reader
must
excuse
me
if
I
be
not
particular
as
to
the
way
they
take
;
for
,
as
we
be
now
draw
near
the
seat
of
the
Boobies
,
and
as
that
be
a
ticklish
name
,
which
malicious
person
may
apply
,
accord
to
their
evil
inclination
,
to
several
worthy
country
squire
,
a
race
of
man
whom
we
look
upon
as
entirely
inoffensive
,
and
for
whom
we
have
an
adequate
regard
,
we
shall
lend
no
assistance
to
any
such
malicious
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
darkness
have
now
overspread
the
hemisphere
,
when
Fanny
whisper
Joseph
"
that
she
beg
to
rest
herself
a
little
;
for
that
she
be
so
tired
she
could
walk
no
farther
.
"
<EOS>
Joseph
immediately
prevail
with
parson
Adams
,
who
be
as
brisk
as
a
bee
,
to
stop
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
sooner
seat
himself
than
he
lament
the
loss
of
his
dear
Aeschylus
;
but
be
a
little
comfort
when
remind
that
,
if
he
have
it
in
his
possession
,
he
could
not
see
to
read
.
  
<EOS>
the
sky
be
so
clouded
,
that
not
a
star
appear
.
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
,
accord
to
Milton
,
darkness
visible
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
circumstance
,
however
,
very
favourable
to
Joseph
;
for
Fanny
,
not
suspicious
of
be
oversee
by
Adams
,
give
a
loose
to
her
passion
which
she
have
never
do
before
,
and
,
recline
her
head
on
his
bosom
,
throw
her
arm
carelessly
round
him
,
and
suffer
him
to
lay
his
cheek
close
to
her
.
<EOS>
all
this
infuse
such
happiness
into
Joseph
,
that
he
would
not
have
change
his
turf
for
the
fine
down
in
the
fine
palace
in
the
universe
.
  
<EOS>
Adams
sit
at
some
distance
from
the
lover
,
and
,
be
unwilling
to
disturb
them
,
apply
himself
to
meditation
;
in
which
he
have
not
spend
much
time
before
he
discover
a
light
at
some
distance
that
seem
approach
towards
him
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
hail
it
;
but
,
to
his
sorrow
and
surprize
,
it
stop
for
a
moment
,
and
then
disappear
.
<EOS>
He
then
call
to
Joseph
,
ask
him
,
"
if
he
have
not
see
the
light
?
"
<EOS>
Joseph
answer
,
"
he
have
.
"
 
"
and
do
you
not
mark
how
it
vanish
?
"
return
he
:
"
though
I
be
not
afraid
of
ghost
,
I
do
not
absolutely
disbelieve
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
then
enter
into
a
meditation
on
those
unsubstantial
being
;
which
be
soon
interrupt
by
several
voice
,
which
he
think
almost
at
his
elbow
,
though
in
fact
they
be
not
so
extremely
near
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
could
distinctly
hear
them
agree
on
the
murder
of
any
one
they
meet
;
and
a
little
after
hear
one
of
them
say
,
"
he
have
kill
a
dozen
since
that
day
fortnight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adams
now
fall
on
his
knee
,
and
commit
himself
to
the
care
of
Providence
;
and
poor
Fanny
,
who
likewise
hear
those
terrible
word
,
embrace
Joseph
so
closely
,
that
have
not
he
,
whose
ear
be
also
open
,
be
apprehensive
on
her
account
,
he
would
have
think
no
danger
which
threaten
only
himself
too
dear
a
price
for
such
embrace
.
  
<EOS>
Joseph
now
draw
forth
his
penknife
,
and
Adams
,
have
finish
his
ejaculation
,
grasp
his
crab
-
stick
,
his
only
weapon
,
and
,
come
up
to
Joseph
,
would
have
have
him
quit
Fanny
,
and
place
her
in
the
rear
;
but
his
advice
be
fruitless
;
she
cling
closer
to
him
,
not
at
all
regard
the
presence
of
Adams
,
and
in
a
soothing
voice
declare
,
"
she
would
die
in
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Joseph
,
clasp
her
with
inexpressible
eagerness
,
whisper
her
,
"
that
he
prefer
death
in
her
to
life
out
of
them
.
"
<EOS>
Adams
,
brandish
his
crabstick
,
say
,
"
he
despise
death
as
much
as
any
man
,
"
and
then
repeat
aloud
       
"
Est
hic
,
est
animus
lucis
contemptor
et
illum
,
    
Qui
vita
bene
credat
emi
quo
tendis
,
honorem
.
"
  
<EOS>
upon
this
the
voice
cease
for
a
moment
,
and
then
one
of
them
call
out
,
"
D####n
you
,
who
be
there
?
"
<EOS>
to
which
Adams
be
prudent
enough
to
make
no
reply
;
and
of
a
sudden
he
observe
half
-
a
-
dozen
light
,
which
seem
to
rise
all
at
once
from
the
ground
and
advance
briskly
towards
him
.
<EOS>
this
he
immediately
conclude
to
be
an
apparition
;
and
now
,
begin
to
conceive
that
the
voice
be
of
the
same
kind
,
he
call
out
,
"
<EOS>
in
the
name
of
the
L####d
,
what
wouldst
thou
have
?
"
<EOS>
He
have
no
sooner
speak
than
he
hear
one
of
the
voice
cry
out
,
"
D####n
them
,
here
they
come
;
"
and
soon
after
hear
several
hearty
blow
,
as
if
a
number
of
man
have
be
engage
at
quarterstaff
.
<EOS>
He
be
just
advance
towards
the
place
of
combat
,
when
Joseph
,
catch
him
by
the
skirt
,
beg
him
that
they
may
take
the
opportunity
of
the
dark
to
convey
away
Fanny
from
the
danger
which
threaten
her
.
<EOS>
He
presently
comply
,
and
,
Joseph
lift
up
Fanny
,
they
all
three
make
the
good
of
their
way
;
and
without
look
behind
them
,
or
be
overtake
,
they
have
travel
full
two
mile
,
poor
Fanny
not
once
complain
of
be
tired
,
when
they
see
afar
off
several
light
scatter
at
a
small
distance
from
each
other
,
and
at
the
same
time
find
themselves
on
the
descent
of
a
very
steep
hill
.
<EOS>
Adams
's
foot
slip
,
he
instantly
disappear
,
which
greatly
frighten
both
Joseph
and
Fanny
:
indeed
,
if
the
light
have
permit
them
to
see
it
,
they
would
scarce
have
refrain
laugh
to
see
the
parson
roll
down
the
hill
;
which
he
do
from
top
to
bottom
,
without
receive
any
harm
.
<EOS>
He
then
hollow
as
loud
as
he
could
,
to
inform
them
of
his
safety
,
and
relieve
them
from
the
fear
which
they
have
conceive
for
him
.
<EOS>
Joseph
and
Fanny
halt
some
time
,
consider
what
to
do
;
at
last
they
advance
a
few
pace
,
where
the
declivity
seem
least
steep
;
and
then
Joseph
,
take
his
Fanny
in
his
arm
,
walk
firmly
down
the
hill
,
without
make
a
false
step
,
and
at
length
land
her
at
the
bottom
,
where
Adams
soon
come
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
learn
hence
,
my
fair
countrywoman
,
to
consider
your
own
weakness
,
and
the
many
occasion
on
which
the
strength
of
a
man
may
be
useful
to
you
;
and
,
duly
weigh
this
,
take
care
<EOS>
that
you
match
not
yourself
with
the
spindle
-
shank
beau
and
petit
-
maitre
of
the
age
,
who
,
instead
of
be
able
,
like
Joseph
Andrews
,
to
carry
you
in
lusty
arm
through
the
rugged
way
and
downhill
steep
of
life
,
will
rather
want
to
support
their
feeble
limb
with
your
strength
and
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
Our
traveller
now
move
forwards
where
the
near
light
present
itself
;
and
,
have
cross
a
common
field
,
they
come
to
a
meadow
,
where
they
seem
to
be
at
a
very
little
distance
from
the
light
,
when
,
to
their
grief
,
they
arrive
at
the
bank
of
a
river
.
<EOS>
Adams
here
make
a
full
stop
,
and
declare
he
could
swim
,
but
doubt
how
it
be
possible
to
get
Fanny
over
:
to
which
Joseph
answer
,
"
if
they
walk
along
its
bank
,
they
may
be
certain
of
soon
find
a
bridge
,
especially
as
by
the
number
of
light
they
may
be
assure
a
parish
be
near
.
"
<EOS>
"
Odso
,
that
be
true
indeed
,
"
say
Adams
;
"
I
do
not
think
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
Joseph
's
advice
be
take
,
they
pass
over
two
meadow
,
and
come
to
a
little
orchard
,
which
lead
them
to
a
house
.
<EOS>
Fanny
beg
of
Joseph
to
knock
at
the
door
,
assure
him
<EOS>
"
she
be
so
weary
that
she
could
hardly
stand
on
her
foot
.
<EOS>
"
Adams
,
who
be
foremost
,
perform
this
ceremony
;
and
,
the
door
be
immediately
open
,
a
plain
kind
of
man
appear
at
it
:
Adams
acquaint
him
"
that
they
have
a
young
woman
with
them
who
be
so
tired
with
her
journey
that
he
should
be
much
oblige
to
him
if
he
would
suffer
her
to
come
in
and
rest
herself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
man
,
who
see
Fanny
by
the
light
of
the
candle
which
he
hold
in
his
hand
,
perceive
her
innocent
and
modest
look
,
and
have
no
apprehension
from
the
civil
behaviour
of
Adams
,
presently
answer
,
"
that
the
young
woman
be
very
welcome
to
rest
herself
in
his
house
,
and
so
be
her
company
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
usher
them
into
a
very
decent
room
,
where
his
wife
be
sit
at
a
table
:
she
immediately
rise
up
,
and
assist
them
in
set
forth
chair
,
and
desire
them
to
sit
down
;
which
they
have
no
sooner
do
than
the
man
of
the
house
ask
them
if
they
would
have
anything
to
refresh
themselves
with
?
<EOS>
Adams
thank
him
,
and
answer
he
should
be
oblige
to
him
for
a
cup
of
his
ale
,
which
be
likewise
choose
by
Joseph
and
Fanny
.
<EOS>
whilst
he
be
go
to
fill
a
very
large
jug
with
this
liquor
<EOS>
,
his
wife
tell
Fanny
she
seem
greatly
fatigue
,
and
desire
her
to
take
something
strong
than
ale
;
but
she
refuse
with
many
thank
,
say
it
be
true
<EOS>
she
be
very
much
tired
,
but
a
little
rest
she
hope
would
restore
her
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
company
be
all
seat
,
Mr
Adams
,
who
have
fill
himself
with
ale
,
and
by
public
permission
have
light
his
pipe
,
turn
to
the
master
of
the
house
,
ask
him
,
"
if
evil
spirit
do
not
use
to
walk
in
that
neighbourhood
?
"
<EOS>
to
which
receive
no
answer
,
he
begin
to
inform
him
of
the
adventure
which
they
meet
with
on
the
down
;
nor
have
he
proceed
far
in
the
story
when
somebody
knock
very
hard
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
the
company
express
some
amazement
,
and
Fanny
and
the
good
woman
turn
pale
:
her
husband
go
forth
,
and
whilst
he
be
absent
,
which
be
some
time
,
they
all
remain
silent
,
look
at
one
another
,
and
hear
several
voice
discourse
pretty
loudly
.
<EOS>
Adams
be
fully
persuade
that
spirit
be
abroad
,
and
begin
to
meditate
some
exorcism
;
Joseph
a
little
inclined
to
the
same
opinion
;
Fanny
be
more
afraid
of
man
;
and
the
good
woman
herself
begin
to
suspect
her
guest
,
and
imagine
those
without
be
rogue
belong
to
their
gang
.
<EOS>
at
length
the
master
of
the
house
return
,
and
,
laughing
,
tell
Adams
he
have
discover
his
apparition
;
that
the
murderer
be
sheep
-
stealer
,
and
the
twelve
person
murder
be
no
other
than
twelve
sheep
;
add
,
that
the
shepherd
have
get
the
well
of
them
,
have
secure
two
,
and
be
proceed
with
them
to
a
justice
of
peace
.
<EOS>
this
account
greatly
relieve
the
fear
of
the
whole
company
;
but
Adams
mutter
to
himself
,
"
He
be
convince
of
the
truth
of
apparition
for
all
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
now
sit
chearfully
round
the
fire
,
till
the
master
of
the
house
,
have
survey
his
guest
,
and
conceive
that
the
cassock
,
which
,
have
fall
down
,
appear
under
Adams
's
greatcoat
,
and
the
shabby
livery
on
Joseph
Andrews
,
do
not
well
suit
with
the
familiarity
between
them
,
begin
to
entertain
some
suspicion
not
much
to
their
advantage
:
address
himself
therefore
to
Adams
,
he
say
,
"
He
perceive
he
be
a
clergyman
by
his
dress
,
and
suppose
that
honest
man
be
his
footman
.
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
answer
Adams
,
"
I
be
a
clergyman
at
your
service
;
but
as
to
that
young
man
,
whom
you
have
rightly
term
honest
,
he
be
at
present
in
nobody
's
service
;
he
never
live
in
any
other
family
than
that
of
Lady
Booby
,
from
whence
he
be
discharge
,
I
assure
you
,
for
no
crime
.
"
<EOS>
Joseph
say
,
"
He
do
not
wonder
the
gentleman
be
surprize
to
see
one
of
Mr
Adams
's
character
condescend
to
so
much
goodness
with
a
poor
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Child
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
I
should
be
ashamed
of
my
cloth
if
I
think
a
poor
man
,
who
be
honest
,
below
my
notice
or
my
familiarity
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
those
who
think
otherwise
can
profess
themselves
follower
and
servant
of
Him
who
make
no
distinction
,
unless
,
peradventure
,
by
prefer
the
poor
to
the
rich
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
address
himself
to
the
gentleman
,
"
these
two
poor
young
people
be
my
parishioner
,
and
I
look
on
them
and
love
them
as
my
child
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
singular
enough
in
their
history
,
but
I
have
not
now
time
to
recount
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
master
of
the
house
,
notwithstanding
the
simplicity
which
discover
itself
in
Adams
,
know
too
much
of
the
world
to
give
a
hasty
belief
to
profession
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
yet
quite
certain
that
Adams
have
any
more
of
the
clergyman
in
him
than
his
cassock
.
<EOS>
to
try
him
therefore
further
,
he
ask
him
,
"
if
Mr
Pope
have
lately
publish
anything
new
?
"
<EOS>
Adams
answer
,
"
He
have
hear
great
commendation
of
that
poet
,
but
that
he
have
never
read
nor
know
any
of
his
work
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ho
!
ho
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
gentleman
to
himself
,
"
have
I
catch
you
?
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
"
have
you
never
see
his
Homer
?
"
<EOS>
Adams
answer
,
"
he
have
never
read
any
translation
of
the
classick
.
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
truly
,
"
reply'd
the
gentleman
,
"
there
be
a
dignity
in
the
greek
language
which
I
think
no
modern
tongue
can
reach
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
understand
Greek
,
sir
?
"
say
Adams
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
a
little
,
sir
,
"
answer
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
,
sir
,
"
cry'd
Adams
,
"
where
I
can
buy
an
Aeschylus
?
<EOS>
an
unlucky
misfortune
lately
happen
to
mine
.
<EOS>
"
Aeschylus
be
beyond
the
gentleman
,
though
he
know
him
very
well
by
name
;
he
therefore
,
return
back
to
Homer
,
ask
Adams
,
"
what
part
of
the
Iliad
he
think
most
excellent
?
<EOS>
"
Adams
return
,
"
His
question
would
be
proper
,
what
kind
of
beauty
be
the
chief
in
poetry
?
<EOS>
for
that
Homer
be
equally
excellent
in
them
all
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
"
continue
he
,
"
what
Cicero
say
of
a
complete
orator
may
well
be
apply
to
a
great
poet
:
"
He
ought
to
comprehend
all
perfection
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Homer
do
this
in
the
most
excellent
degree
;
it
be
not
without
reason
,
therefore
,
that
the
philosopher
,
in
the
twenty
-
second
chapter
of
his
Poeticks
,
mention
him
by
no
other
appellation
than
that
of
the
Poet
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
father
of
the
drama
as
well
as
the
epic
;
not
of
tragedy
only
,
but
of
comedy
also
;
for
his
Margites
,
which
be
deplorably
lose
,
bore
,
say
Aristotle
,
the
same
analogy
to
comedy
as
his
Odyssey
and
Iliad
to
tragedy
.
<EOS>
to
him
,
therefore
,
we
owe
aristophane
as
well
as
Euripides
,
Sophocles
,
and
my
poor
Aeschylus
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
please
we
will
confine
ourselves
(
at
least
for
the
present
)
to
the
Iliad
,
his
noble
work
;
though
neither
Aristotle
nor
Horace
give
it
the
preference
,
as
I
remember
,
to
the
Odyssey
.
<EOS>
first
,
then
,
as
to
his
subject
,
can
anything
be
more
simple
,
and
at
the
same
time
more
noble
?
<EOS>
He
be
rightly
praise
by
the
first
of
those
judicious
critic
for
not
chuse
the
whole
war
,
<EOS>
which
,
though
he
say
it
hath
a
complete
beginning
and
end
,
would
have
be
too
great
for
the
understanding
to
comprehend
at
one
view
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
therefore
,
often
wonder
why
so
correct
a
writer
as
Horace
should
,
in
his
epistle
to
Lollius
,
call
him
the
Trojani
Belli
Scriptorem
.
<EOS>
secondly
,
his
action
,
term
by
Aristotle
,
Pragmaton
Systasis
;
be
it
possible
for
the
mind
of
man
to
conceive
an
idea
of
such
perfect
unity
,
and
at
the
same
time
so
replete
with
greatness
?
<EOS>
and
here
I
must
observe
,
what
I
do
not
remember
to
have
see
note
by
any
,
the
Harmotton
,
that
agreement
of
his
action
to
his
subject
:
for
,
as
the
subject
be
anger
,
how
agreeable
be
his
action
,
which
be
war
;
from
which
every
incident
arise
and
to
which
every
episode
immediately
relate
.
<EOS>
thirdly
,
his
manner
,
which
Aristotle
place
second
in
his
description
of
the
several
part
of
tragedy
,
and
which
he
say
be
include
in
the
action
;
I
be
at
a
loss
whether
I
should
rather
admire
the
exactness
of
his
judgment
in
the
nice
distinction
or
the
immensity
of
his
imagination
in
their
variety
.
<EOS>
for
,
as
to
the
former
of
these
,
how
accurately
be
the
sedate
,
injure
resentment
of
Achilles
,
distinguish
from
the
hot
,
insult
passion
of
Agamemnon
!
<EOS>
how
widely
doth
the
brutal
courage
of
Ajax
differ
from
the
amiable
bravery
of
Diomedes
;
and
the
wisdom
of
Nestor
,
which
be
the
result
of
long
reflection
and
experience
,
from
the
cunning
of
Ulysses
,
the
effect
of
art
and
subtlety
only
!
<EOS>
if
we
consider
their
variety
,
we
may
cry
out
,
with
Aristotle
in
his
24th
chapter
,
that
no
part
of
this
divine
poem
be
destitute
of
manner
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
may
affirm
that
there
be
scarce
a
character
in
human
nature
untouche
in
some
part
or
other
.
<EOS>
and
,
as
there
be
no
passion
which
he
be
not
able
to
describe
,
so
be
there
none
in
his
reader
which
he
can
not
raise
.
<EOS>
if
he
hath
any
superior
excellence
to
the
rest
,
I
have
be
incline
to
fancy
it
be
in
the
pathetic
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
never
read
with
dry
eye
the
two
episode
where
Andromache
be
introduce
in
the
former
lamenting
the
danger
,
and
in
the
latter
the
death
,
of
Hector
.
<EOS>
the
image
be
so
extremely
tender
in
these
,
that
I
be
convince
the
poet
have
the
worthy
and
good
heart
imaginable
.
<EOS>
nor
can
I
help
observe
how
Sophocles
fall
short
of
the
beauty
of
the
original
,
in
that
imitation
of
the
dissuasive
speech
of
Andromache
<EOS>
which
he
hath
put
into
the
mouth
of
Tecmessa
.
<EOS>
and
yet
Sophocles
be
the
great
genius
who
ever
write
tragedy
;
nor
have
any
of
his
successor
in
that
art
,
that
be
to
say
,
neither
Euripides
nor
Seneca
the
tragedian
,
be
able
to
come
near
him
.
<EOS>
as
to
his
sentiment
and
diction
,
I
need
say
nothing
;
the
former
be
particularly
remarkable
for
the
utmost
perfection
on
that
head
,
namely
,
propriety
;
and
as
to
the
latter
,
Aristotle
,
whom
doubtless
you
have
read
over
and
over
,
be
very
diffuse
.
<EOS>
I
shall
mention
but
one
thing
more
,
which
that
great
critic
in
his
division
of
tragedy
call
Opsis
,
or
the
scenery
;
and
which
be
as
proper
to
the
epic
as
to
the
drama
,
with
this
difference
,
that
in
the
former
it
fall
to
the
share
of
the
poet
,
and
in
the
latter
to
that
of
the
painter
.
<EOS>
but
do
ever
painter
imagine
a
scene
like
that
in
the
13th
and
14th
Iliads
?
<EOS>
where
the
reader
see
at
one
view
the
prospect
of
Troy
,
with
the
army
draw
up
before
it
;
the
grecian
army
,
camp
,
and
fleet
;
Jupiter
sit
on
Mount
Ida
,
with
his
head
wrapt
in
a
cloud
,
and
a
thunderbolt
in
his
hand
,
look
towards
Thrace
;
<EOS>
Neptune
drive
through
the
sea
,
which
divide
on
each
side
to
permit
his
passage
,
and
then
seat
himself
on
Mount
Samos
;
the
heaven
open
,
and
the
deity
all
seat
on
their
throne
.
<EOS>
this
be
sublime
!
<EOS>
this
be
poetry
!
"
<EOS>
Adams
then
rapt
out
a
hundred
greek
verse
,
and
with
such
a
voice
,
emphasis
,
and
action
,
that
he
almost
frighten
the
woman
;
and
as
for
the
gentleman
,
he
be
so
far
from
entertain
any
further
suspicion
of
Adams
,
that
he
now
doubt
whether
he
have
not
a
bishop
in
his
house
.
<EOS>
He
run
into
the
most
extravagant
encomium
on
his
learning
;
and
the
goodness
of
his
heart
begin
to
dilate
to
all
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
have
great
compassion
for
the
poor
young
woman
,
who
look
pale
and
faint
with
her
journey
;
and
in
truth
he
conceive
a
much
high
opinion
of
her
quality
than
it
deserve
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
be
sorry
he
could
not
accommodate
them
all
;
but
if
they
be
content
with
his
fireside
,
he
would
sit
up
with
the
man
;
and
the
young
woman
may
,
if
she
please
,
partake
his
wife
's
bed
,
which
he
advise
her
to
;
for
that
they
must
walk
upwards
of
a
mile
to
any
house
of
entertainment
,
and
that
not
very
good
neither
.

,
who
like
his
seat
,
his
ale

,
persuade
Fanny
to
accept
this
kind
proposal
,
in
which
sollicitation
he
be
second
by
Joseph
.
<EOS>
nor
be
she
very
difficultly
prevail
on
;
for
she
have
sleep
little
the
last
night
and
not
at
all
the
precede
;
so
that

produce

eatable

good

<EOS>
the
man
of
the
house
,
Adams
,
and
Joseph
,
who
would
modestly
have
withdraw
,
have
not
the

insist
on
the
contrary
,
draw
round
the
fireside
,
where
Adams
(
to
use
his
own
word
)
replenish
his
pipe
,
and
the
gentleman
produce
a
bottle
of
excellent
beer
,
be
the
good
liquor
in
his
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
modest
behaviour
of
Joseph
,
with
the
gracefulness
of
his
person
,
the
character
which
Adams
give
of
him
,
and
the
friendship
he
seem
to
entertain
for
him
,
begin
to
work
on
the
gentleman
's
affection
,
and
raise
in
him
a
curiosity
to
know
the
singularity
which
Adams
have
mention
in
his
history
.
<EOS>
this
curiosity
Adams
be
no
sooner
inform
of
than
,
with
Joseph
's
consent
,
he
agree
to
gratify
it
;
and
accordingly
relate
all
he
know
,
with
as
much
tenderness
as
be
possible
for
the
character
of
Lady
Booby
;
and
conclude
with
the
long
,
faithful
,
and
mutual
passion
between
him
and
Fanny
,
not
conceal
the
meanness
of
her
birth
and
education
.
<EOS>
these
latter
circumstance
entirely
cure
a
jealousy
which
have
lately
rise
in
the
gentleman
's
mind
,
that
Fanny
be
the
daughter
of
some
person
of
fashion
,
and
that
Joseph
have
run
away
with
her
,
and
Adams
be
concern
in
the
plot
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
enamour
of
his
guest
,
drink
their
health
with
great
chearfulness
,
and
return
many
thank
to
Adams
,
who
have
spend
much
breath
,
for
he
be
a
circumstantial
teller
of
a
story

<EOS>
Adams
tell
him
it
be
now
in
his
power
to
return
that
favour

extraordinary

raise

more

ever
know

<EOS>
the
author
hath
by
some
be
represent
to
have
make
a
blunder
    
here
:
for
Adams
have
indeed
show
some
learning
(
say
they
)
,
perhaps
    
all
the
author
have
;
but
the
gentleman
hath
show
none
,
unless
his
    
approbation
of
Mr
Adams
be
such
:
but
surely
it
would
be
preposterous
    
in
him
to
call
it
so
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
however
,
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
    
criticism
,
which
I
be
tell
come
from
the
mouth
of
a
great
orator
in
    
a
public
coffee

house
,
leave
this
blunder
as
it
stand
in
the
first
    
edition
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
have
the
vanity
to
apply
to
anything
in
this
    
work
the
observation
which
M.
Dacier
make
in

preface
to
her
    
Aristophanes
:
<EOS>

<EOS>
Mr

hath
make
such
another
blunder
in
his
Love
for
Love
,
where
    
Tattle
tell
Miss
Prue
,
"
She
should
admire
him
as
much
for
the
    
beauty
he
commend

possess
of
it

"
  
<EOS>
the
gentleman
answer
,
he
could
not
refuse
him
what
he
have
so
much
right
to
insist
on
;
and
after
some
of
the
common
apology
,
which
be
the
usual
preface
to
a
story
,
he
thus
begin
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
in
which
the
gentleman
relate
the
history
of
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
be
descend
of
a
good
family
,
and
be
bear
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
My
education
be
liberal
,
and
at
a
public
school
,
in
which
I
proceed
so
far
as
to
become
master
of
the
Latin
,
and
to
be
tolerably
verse
in
the
greek
language
.
<EOS>
My
father
die
when
I
be
sixteen
,
and
leave
me
master
of
myself
.
<EOS>
He
bequeath
me
a
moderate
fortune
,
which
he
intend
I
should
not
receive
till
I
attain
the
age
of
twenty
-
five
:
for
he
constantly
assert
that
be
full
early
enough
to
give
up
any
man
entirely
to
the
guidance
of
his
own
discretion
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
this
intention
be
so
obscurely
word
in
his
will
that
the
lawyer
advise
me
to
contest
the
point
with
my
trustee
<EOS>
,
I
own
I
pay
so
little
regard
to
the
inclination
of
my
dead
father
,
which
be
sufficiently
certain
to
me
,
that
I
follow
their
advice
,
and
soon
succeed
,
for
the
trustee
<EOS>
do
not
contest
the
matter
very
obstinately
on
their
side
.
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
may
I
crave
the
favour
of
your
name
?
"
<EOS>
the
gentleman
answer
his
name
be
Wilson
,
and
then
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
I
stay
a
very
little
while
at
school
after
his
death
;
for
,
be
a
forward
youth
,
I
be
extremely
impatient
to
be
in
the
world
,
for
which
I
think
my
part
,
knowledge
,
and
manhood
thoroughly
qualify
me
.
<EOS>
and
to
this
early
introduction
into
life
,
without
a
guide
,
I
impute
all
my
future
misfortune
;
for
,
besides
the
obvious
mischief
which
attend
this
,
there
be
one
which
hath
not
be
so
generally
observe
:
the
first
impression
which
mankind
receive
of
you
will
be
very
difficult
to
eradicate
.
<EOS>
how
unhappy
,
therefore
,
must
it
be
to
fix
your
character
in
life
,
before
you
can
possibly
know
its
value
,
or
weigh
the
consequence
of
those
action
which
be
to
establish
your
future
reputation
!
  
<EOS>
a
little
under
seventeen
<EOS>
I
leave
my
school
,
and
go
to
London
with
no
more
than
six
pound
in
my
pocket
;
a
great
sum
,
as
I
then
conceive
;
and
which
I
be
afterwards
surprize
to
find
so
soon
consume
.
  
<EOS>
the
character
<EOS>
I
be
ambitious
of
attaining
<EOS>
be
that
of
a
fine
gentleman
;
the
first
requisite
to
which
I
apprehend
be
to
be
supply
by
a
taylor
,
a
periwig
-
maker
,
and
some
few
more
tradesman
,
who
deal
in
furnish
out
the
human
body
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
lowness
of
my
purse
,
I
find
credit
with
them
more
easily
than
I
expect
,
and
be
soon
equip
to
my
wish
.
<EOS>
this
I
own
then
agreeably
surprize
me
;
but
I
have
since
learn
that
it
be
a
maxim
among
many
tradesman
at
the
polite
end
of
the
town
to
deal
as
largely
as
they
can
,
reckon
as
high
as
they
can
,
and
arrest
as
soon
as
they
can
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
qualification
,
namely
,
dance
,
fence
,
ride
the
great
horse
,
and
music
,
come
into
my
head
:
but
,
as
they
require
expense
and
time
,
I
comfort
myself
,
with
regard
to
dancing
,
that
I
have
learn
a
little
in
my
youth
,
and
could
walk
a
minuet
genteelly
enough
;
<EOS>
as
to
fence
,
I
think
my
good
-
humour
would
preserve
me
from
the
danger
of
a
quarrel
;
as
to
the
horse
,
I
hope
it
would
not
be
think
of
;
and
for
music
,
I
imagine
I
could
easily
acquire
the
reputation
of
it
;
for
I
have
hear
some
of
my
schoolfellow
pretend
to
knowledge
in
opera
,
without
be
able
to
sing
or
play
on
the
fiddle
.
  
<EOS>
knowledge
of
the
town
seem
another
ingredient
;
this
I
think
I
should
arrive
at
by
frequent
public
place
.
<EOS>
accordingly
I
pay
constant
attendance
to
them
all
;
by
which
mean
I
be
soon
master
of
the
fashionable
phrase
,
learn
to
cry
up
the
fashionable
diversion
,
and
know
the
name
and
face
of
the
most
fashionable
man
and
woman
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
now
seem
to
remain
but
an
intrigue
,
which
I
be
resolve
to
have
immediately
;
I
mean
the
reputation
of
it
;
and
indeed
I
be
so
successful
,
that
in
a
very
short
time
I
have
half
-
a
-
dozen
with
the
fine
woman
in
town
.
  
<EOS>
at
these
word
Adams
fetch
a
deep
groan
,
and
then
,
bless
himself
,
cry
out
,
"
good
Lord
!
<EOS>
what
wicked
time
these
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
not
so
wicked
as
you
imagine
,
continue
the
gentleman
;
for
I
assure
you
they
be
all
vestal
virgin
for
anything
which
I
know
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
the
reputation
of
intrigue
with
them
be
all
I
seek
,
and
be
what
I
arrive
at
:
and
perhaps
I
only
flatter
myself
even
in
that
;
for
very
probably
the
person
to
whom
I
show
their
billet
know
as
well
as
I
that
they
be
counterfeit
,
and
that
I
have
write
them
to
myself
.
"
<EOS>
write
letter
to
yourself
!
"
<EOS>
say
Adams
,
stare
.
<EOS>
o
sir
,
answer
the
gentleman
,
it
be
the
very
error
of
the
time
.
<EOS>
half
our
modern
play
have
one
of
these
character
in
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
incredible
the
pain
I
have
take
,
and
the
absurd
method
I
employ
,
to
traduce
the
character
of
woman
of
distinction
.
<EOS>
when
another
have
speak
in
rapture
of
any
one
,
I
have
answer
,
"
d####n
her
,
she
!
<EOS>
We
shall
have
her
at
h####d
be
very
soon
.
<EOS>
"
when
he
hath
reply
,
"
He
think
her
virtuous
,
"
I
have
answer
,
"
ay
,
thou
wilt
always
think
a
woman
virtuous
,
till
she
be
in
the
street
;
but
you
and
I
,
Jack
or
Tom
(
turn
to
another
in
company
)
,
know
better
.
"
<EOS>
at
which
I
have
draw
a
paper
out
of
my
pocket
,
perhaps
a
taylor
's
bill
,
and
kiss
it
,
cry
at
the
same
time
,
"
<EOS>
by
Gad
I
be
once
fond
of
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
proceed
,
if
you
please
,
but
do
not
swear
any
more
,
"
say
Adams
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
the
gentleman
,
I
ask
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
in
this
course
of
life
I
continue
full
three
year
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
course
of
life
?
<EOS>
"
answer
Adams
;
"
I
do
not
remember
you
have
mention
any
.
"
 
<EOS>
Your
remark
be
just
,
say
the
gentleman
,
smile
;
I
should
rather
have
say
,
in
this
course
of
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
remember
some
time
afterwards
I
write
the
journal
of
one
day
,
which
would
serve
,
I
believe
,
as
well
for
any
other
during
the
whole
time
.
<EOS>
I
will
endeavour
to
repeat
it
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
morning
I
arise
,
take
my
great
stick
,
and
walk
out
in
my
green
frock
,
with
my
hair
in
paper
(
a
groan
from
Adams
)
,
and
saunter
about
till
ten
.
<EOS>
go
to
the
auction
;
tell
lady

<EOS>
she
have

laugh
heartily

at
all
which

worth

<EOS>
at
which
Adams
say
,
with
some
vehemence
,
"
Sir
,
this
be
below
the
life
of
an
animal
,
hardly
above
vegetation
:
and
I
be
surprize
what
could
lead
a
man
of
your
sense
into
it
.
<EOS>
"
what
lead
us
into
more
folly
than
you
imagine
,
doctor
,
answer
the
gentleman
 
vanity
;
for
as
contemptible
a
creature
as
I
be
,
and
I
assure
you
,
yourself
can
not
have
more
contempt
for
such
a
wretch
than
I
now
have
,
I
then
admire
myself
,
and
should
have
despise
a
person
of
your
present
appearance
(
you
will
pardon
me
)
,
with
all
your
learning
and
those
excellent
quality
which
I
have
remark
in
you
.
<EOS>
Adams
bow
,
and
beg
him
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
after
I
have
continue
two
year
in
this
course
of
life
,
say
the
gentleman
,
an
accident
happen
which
oblige
me
to
change
the
scene
.
<EOS>
as
I
be
one
day
at
St
James
's
coffee
-
house
,
make
very
free
with
the
character
of
a
young
lady
of
quality
,
an
officer
of
the
guard
,
who
be
present
,
think
proper
to
give
me
the
lye
.
<EOS>
I
answer
I
may
possibly
be
mistaken
,
but
I
intend
to
tell
no
more
than
the
truth
.
<EOS>
to
which
he
make
no
reply
but
by
a
scornful
sneer
.
<EOS>
after
this
I
observe
a
strange
coldness
in
all
my
acquaintance
;
none
of
them
speak
to
me
first
,
and
very
few
return
me
even
the
civility
of
a
bow
.
<EOS>
the
company
I
use
to
dine
with
leave
me
out
,
and
within
a
week
I
find
myself
in
as
much
solitude
at
St
James
's
as
if
I
have
be
in
a
desart
.
<EOS>
an
honest
elderly
man
,
with
a
great
hat
and
long
sword
,
at
last
tell
me
he
have
a
compassion
for
my
youth
,
and
therefore
advise
me
to
show
the
world
<EOS>
I
be
not
such
a
rascal
as
they
think
me
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
at
first
understand
him
;
but
he
explain
himself
,
and
end
with
tell
me
,
if
I
would
write
a
challenge
to
the
captain
,
he
would
,
out
of
pure
charity
,
go
to
him
with
it
.
"
<EOS>
a
very
charitable
person
,
truly
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Adams
.
<EOS>
I
desire
till
the
next
day
,
continue
the
gentleman
,
to
consider
on
it
,
and
,
retire
to
my
lodging
,
I
weigh
the
consequence
on
both
side
as
fairly
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
on
the
one
,
I
see
the
risk
of
this
alternative
,
either
lose
my
own
life
,
or
have
on
my
hand
the
blood
of
a
man
with
whom
I
be
not
in
the
least
angry
.
<EOS>
I
soon
determine
that
the
good
which
appear
on
the
other
be
not
worth
this
hazard
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
resolve
to
quit
the
scene
,
and
presently
retire
to
the
Temple
,
where
I
take
chamber
.
<EOS>
here
I
soon
get
a
fresh
set
of
acquaintance
,
who
know
nothing
of
what
have
happen
to
me
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
they
be
not
greatly
to
my
approbation
;
for
the
beaus
of
the
Temple
be
only
the
shadow
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
They
be
the
affectation
of
affectation
.
<EOS>
the
vanity
of
these
be
still
more
ridiculous
,
if
possible
,
than
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
here
I
meet
with
smart
fellow
who
drink
with
lord
they
do
not
know
,
and
intrigue
with
woman
they
never
see
.
<EOS>
Covent
Garden
be
now
the
farth
stretch
of
my
ambition
;
where
I
shine
forth
in
the
balcony
at
the
playhouse
,
visit
whore
,
make
love
to
orange
-
wench
,
and
damned
play
.
<EOS>
this
career
be
soon
put
a
stop
to
by
my
surgeon
,
who
convince
me
of
the
necessity
of
confine
myself
to
my
room
for
a
month
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
which
,
have
have
leisure
to
reflect
,
I
resolve
to
quit
all
farth
conversation
with
beaus
and
smart
of
every
kind
,
and
to
avoid
,
if
possible
,
any
occasion
of
return
to
this
place
of
confinement
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
the
advice
of
a
month
's
retirement
and
reflection
be
very
proper
;
but
I
should
rather
have
expect
it
from
a
divine
than
a
surgeon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
gentleman
smile
at
Adams
's
simplicity
,
and
,
without
explain
himself
farther
on
such
an
odious
subject
,
go
on
thus
:
<EOS>
I
be
no
sooner
perfectly
restore
to
health
than
I
find
my
passion
for
woman
,
which
I
be
afraid
to
satisfy
as
I
have
do
,
make
me
very
uneasy
<EOS>
;
I
determine
,
therefore
,
to
keep
a
mistress
.
<EOS>
nor
be
I
long
before
I
fix
my
choice
on
a
young
woman
,
who
have
before
be
keep
by
two
gentleman
,
and
to
whom
I
be
recommend
by
a
celebrated
bawd
.
<EOS>
I
take
her
home
to
my
chamber
,
and
make
her
a
settlement
during
cohabitation
.
<EOS>
this
would
,
perhaps
,
have
be
very
ill
pay
:
however
,
she
do
not
suffer
me
to
be
perplex
on
that
account
;
for
,
before
quarter
-
day
,
I
find
her
at
my
chamber
in
too
familiar
conversation
with
a
young
fellow
who
be
dr
like
an
officer
,
but
be
indeed
a
city
apprentice
.
<EOS>
instead
of
excuse
her
inconstancy
,
she
rap
out
half
-
a
-
dozen
oath
,
and
,
snap
her
finger
at
me
,
swear
she
scorn
to
confine
herself
to
the
good
man
in
England
.
<EOS>
upon
this
we
part
,
and
the
same
bawd
presently
provide
her
another
keeper
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
so
much
concerned
at
our
separation
as
I
find
,
within
a
day
or
two
,
I
have
reason
to
be
for
our
meeting
;
for
I
be
oblige
to
pay
a
second
visit
to
my
surgeon
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
force
to
do
penance
for
some
week
,
during
which
time
I
contract
an
acquaintance
with
a
beautiful
young
girl
,
the
daughter
of
a
gentleman
who
,
after
have
be
forty
year
in
the
army
,
and
in
all
the
campaign
under
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
,
die
a
lieutenant
on
half
-
pay
,
and
have
leave
a
widow
,
with
this
only
child
,
in
very
distrest
circumstance
:
they
have
only
a
small
pension
from
the
government
,
with
what
little
the
daughter
could
add
to
it
by
her
work
,
for
she
have
great
excellence
at
her
needle
.
<EOS>
this
girl
be
,
at
my
first
acquaintance
with
her
,
solicit
in
marriage
by
a
young
fellow
in
good
circumstance
.
<EOS>
He
be
apprentice
to
a
linendraper
,
and
have
a
little
fortune
,
sufficient
to
set
up
his
trade
.
<EOS>
the
mother
be
greatly
pleased
with
this
match
,
as
indeed
she
have
sufficient
reason
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
soon
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
I
represent
him
in
so
low
a
light
to
his
mistress
,
and
make
so
good
an
use
of
flattery
,
promise
,
and
present
,
that
,
not
to
dwell
longer
on
this
subject
than
be
necessary
<EOS>
,
I
prevail
with
the
poor
girl
,
and
convey
her
away
from
her
mother
!
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
I
debauch
her
.
 
<EOS>
(
at
which
word
Adams
start
up
,
fetch
three
stride
across
the
room
,
and
then
replace
himself
in
his
chair
.
)
<EOS>
You
be
not
more
affected
with
this
part
of
my
story
than
myself
;
I
assure
you
it
will
never
be
sufficiently
repent
of
in
my
own
opinion
:
but
,
if
you
already
detest
it
,
how
much
more
will
your
indignation
be
raise
when
you
hear
the
fatal
consequence
of
this
barbarous
,
this
villanous
action
!
<EOS>
if
you
please
,
therefore
,
I
will
here
desist
.
 
<EOS>
"
by
no
means
,
"
cry
Adams
;
"
go
on
,
I
beseech
you
;
and
Heaven
grant
you
may
sincerely
repent
of
this
and
many
other
thing
you
have
relate
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
now
,
continue
the
gentleman
,
as
happy
as
the
possession
of
a
fine
young
creature
,
who
have
a
good
education
,
and
be
endue
with
many
agreeable
quality
,
could
make
me
.
<EOS>
We
live
some
month
with
vast
fondness
together
,
without
any
company
or
conversation
,
more
than
we
find
in
one
another
:
but
this
could
not
continue
always
;
and
,
though
I
still
preserve
great
affection
for
her
,
I
begin
more
and
more
to
want
the
relief
of
other
company
,
and
consequently
to
leave
her
by
degree
 
at
last
whole
day
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
fail
not
to
testify
some
uneasiness
on
these
occasion
,
and
complain
of
the
melancholy
life
she
lead
;
to
remedy
which
,
I
introduce
her
into
the
acquaintance
of
some
other
keep
mistress
,
with
whom
she
use
to
play
at
card
,
and
frequent
play
and
other
diversion
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
live
long
in
this
intimacy
before
I
perceive
a
visible
alteration
in
her
behaviour
;
all
her
modesty
and
innocence
vanish
by
degree
,
till
her
mind
become
thoroughly
tainted
.
<EOS>
She
affect
the
company
of
rake
,
give
herself
all
manner
of
air
,
be
never
easy
but
abroad
,
or
when
she
have
a
party
at
my
chamber
.
<EOS>
She
be
rapacious
of
money
,
extravagant
to
excess
,
loose
in
her
conversation
;
and
,
if
ever
I
demur
to
any
of
her
demand
,
oath
,
tear
,
and
fit
be
the
immediate
consequence
.
<EOS>
as
the
first
rapture
of
fondness
be
long
since
over
,
this
behaviour
soon
estrange
my
affection
from
her
;
I
begin
to
reflect
with
pleasure
that
she
be
not
my
wife
,
and
to
conceive
an
intention
of
part
with
her
;
of
which
,
have
give
her
a
hint
,
she
take
care
to
prevent
me
the
pain
of
turn
her
out
of
door
,
and
accordingly
depart
herself
,
have
first
break
open
my
escrutore
,
and
take
with
her
all
she
could
find
,
to
the
amount
of
about
L200
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
heat
of
my
resentment
I
resolve
to
pursue
her
with
all
the
vengeance
of
the
law
:
but
,
as
she
have
the
good
luck
to
escape
me
during
that
ferment
,
my
passion
afterwards
cool
;
and
,
have
reflect
that
I
have
be
the
first
aggressor
,
and
have
do
her
an
injury
for
which
I
could
make
her
no
reparation
,
by
rob
her
of
the
innocence
of
her
mind
;
and
hear
at
the
same
time
that
the
poor
old
woman
her
mother
have
break
her
heart
on
her
daughter
's
elopement
from
her
,
I
,
conclude
myself
her
murderer
(
"
as
you
very
well
may
,
"
cry
Adams
,
with
a
groan
)
,
be
pleased
that
God
Almighty
have
take
this
method
of
punish
me
,
and
resolve
quietly
to
submit
to
the
loss
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
could
wish
I
have
never
hear
more
of
the
poor
creature
,
who
become
in
the
end
an
abandon
profligate
;
and
,
after
be
some
year
a
common
prostitute
,
at
last
end
her
miserable
life
in
Newgate
.
 
<EOS>
here
the
gentleman
fetch
a
deep
sigh
,
which
Mr
Adams
echo
very
loudly
;
and
both
continue
silent
,
look
on
each
other
for
some
minute
.
<EOS>
at
last
the
gentleman
proceed
thus
:
I
have
be
perfectly
constant
to
this
girl
during
the
whole
time
I
keep
her
:
but
she
have
scarce
depart
before
I
discover
more
mark
of
her
infidelity
to
me
than
the
loss
of
my
money
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
be
force
to
make
a
third
visit
to
my
surgeon
,
out
of
whose
hand
I
do
not
get
a
hasty
discharge
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
forswore
all
future
dealing
with
the
sex
,
complain
loudly
that
the
pleasure
do
not
compensate
the
pain
,
and
rail
at
the
beautiful
creature
in
as
gross
language
as
Juvenal
himself
formerly
revile
them
in
.
<EOS>
I
look
on
all
the
town
harlot
with
a
detestation
not
easy
to
be
conceive
,
their
person
appear
to
me
as
paint
palace
,
inhabit
by
Disease
and
death
:
nor
could
their
beauty
make
them
more
desirable
object
in
my
eye
than
gilding
could
make
me
covet
a
pill
,
or
golden
plate
a
coffin
.
<EOS>
but
though
I
be
no
longer
the
absolute
slave
,
I
find
some
reason
to
own
myself
still
the
subject
,
of
love
.
<EOS>
My
hatred
for
woman
decrease
daily
;
and
I
be
not
positive
but
time
may
have
betray
me
again
to
some
common
harlot
,
have
I
not
be
secure
by
a
passion
for
the
charming
Sapphira
,
which
,
have
once
enter
upon
,
make
a
violent
progress
in
my
heart
.
<EOS>
Sapphira
be
wife
to
a
man
of
fashion
and
gallantry
,
and
one
who
seem
,
I
own
,
every
way
worthy
of
her
affection
;
which
,
however
,
he
have
not
the
reputation
of
have
.
<EOS>
She
be
indeed
a
coquette
achevee
.
<EOS>
"
pray
,
sir
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
what
be
a
coquette
?
<EOS>
I
have
meet
with
the
word
in
french
author
,
but
never
could
assign
any
idea
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
be
the
same
with
une
sotte
,
Anglice
,
a
fool
.
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
answer
the
gentleman
,
perhaps
you
be
not
much
mistaken
;
but
,
as
it
be
a
particular
kind
of
folly
,
I
will
endeavour
to
describe
it
.
<EOS>
be
all
creature
to
be
rank
in
the
order
of
creation
accord
to
their
usefulness
,
I
know
few
animal
that
would
not
take
place
of
a
coquette
;
nor
indeed
hath
this
creature
much
pretence
to
anything
beyond
instinct
;
for
,
though
sometimes
we
may
imagine
it
be
animate
by
the
passion
of
vanity
,
yet
far
the
great
part
of
its
action
fall
beneath
even
that
low
motive
;
for
instance
,
several
absurd
gesture
and
trick
,
infinitely
more
foolish
than
what
can
be
observe
in
the
most
ridiculous
bird
and
beast
,
and
which
would
persuade
the
beholder
that
the
silly
wretch
be
aim
at
our
contempt
.
<EOS>
indeed
its
characteristic
be
affectation
,
and
this
lead
and
govern
by
whim
only
:
for
as
beauty
,
wisdom
,
wit
,
good
-
nature
,
politeness
,
and
health
be
sometimes
affect
by
this
creature
,
so
be
ugliness
,
folly
,
nonsense
,
ill
-
nature
,
ill
-
breeding
,
and
sickness
likewise
put
on
by
it
in
their
turn
.
<EOS>
Its
life
be
one
constant
lie
;
and
the
only
rule
by
which
you
can
form
any
judgment
of
them
be
,
that
they
be
never
what
they
seem
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
possible
for
a
coquette
to
love
(
as
it
be
not
,
for
if
ever
it
attain
this
passion
<EOS>
the
coquette
cease
instantly
)
,
it
would
wear
the
face
of
indifference
,
if
not
of
hatred
,
to
the
beloved
object
;
you
may
therefore
be
assure
,
when
they
endeavour
to
persuade
you
of
their
liking
,
that
they
be
indifferent
to
you
at
least
.
<EOS>
and
indeed
this
be
the
case
of
my
Sapphira
,
who
no
sooner
see
me
in
the
number
of
her
admirer
than
she
give
me
what
be
commonly
call
encouragement
:
she
would
often
look
at
me
,
and
,
when
she
perceive
me
meet
her
eye
,
would
instantly
take
them
off
,
discover
at
the
same
time
as
much
surprize
and
emotion
as
possible
.
<EOS>
these
art
fail
not
of
the
success
she
intend
;
and
,
as
I
grow
more
particular
to
her
than
the
rest
of
her
admirer
,
she
advance
,
in
proportion
,
more
directly
to
me
than
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
She
affect
the
low
voice
,
whisper
,
lisp
,
sigh
,
start
,
laugh
,
and
many
other
indication
of
passion
which
daily
deceive
thousand
.
<EOS>
when
I
play
at
whist
with
her
,
she
would
look
earnestly
at
me
,
and
at
the
same
time
lose
deal
or
revoke
;
then
burst
into
a
ridiculous
laugh
and
cry
,
"
La
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
imagine
what
I
be
think
of
.
<EOS>
"
to
detain
you
no
longer
,
after
I
have
go
through
a
sufficient
course
of
gallantry
,
as
I
think
,
and
be
thoroughly
convinced
I
have
raise
a
violent
passion
in
my
mistress
,
I
seek
an
opportunity
of
come
to
an
eclaircissement
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
avoid
this
as
much
as
possible
;
however
,
great
assiduity
at
length
present
me
one
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
describe
all
the
particular
of
this
interview
;
let
it
suffice
that
,
when
she
could
no
longer
pretend
not
to
see
my
drift
,
she
first
affect
a
violent
surprize
,
and
immediately
after
as
violent
a
passion
:
she
wonder
what
I
have
see
in
her
conduct
which
could
induce
me
to
affront
her
in
this
manner
;
and
,
break
from
me
the
first
moment
she
could
,
tell
me
I
have
no
other
way
to
escape
the
consequence
of
her
resentment
than
by
never
see
,
or
at
least
speak
to
her
more
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
content
with
this
answer
;
I
still
pursue
her
,
but
to
no
purpose
;
and
be
at
length
convince
that
her
husband
have
the
sole
possession
of
her
person
,
and
that
neither
he
nor
any
other
have
make
any
impression
on
her
heart
.
<EOS>
I
be
take
off
from
follow
this
ignis
fatuus
by
some
advance
which
be
make
me
by
the
wife
of
a
citizen
,
who
,
though
neither
very
young
nor
handsome
,
be
yet
too
agreeable
to
be
reject
by
my
amorous
constitution
.
<EOS>
I
accordingly
soon
satisfy
her
that
she
have
not
cast
away
her
hint
on
a
barren
or
cold
soil
:
on
the
contrary
,
they
instantly
produce
her
an
eager
and
desire
lover
.
<EOS>
nor
do
she
give
me
any
reason
to
complain
;
she
meet
the
warmth
she
have
raise
with
equal
ardour
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
longer
a
coquette
to
deal
with
,
but
one
who
be
wise
than
to
prostitute
the
noble
passion
of
love
to
the
ridiculous
lust
of
vanity
.
<EOS>
We
presently
understand
one
another
;
and
,
as
the
pleasure
we
seek
lie
in
a
mutual
gratification
,
we
soon
find
and
enjoy
them
.
<EOS>
I
think
myself
at
first
greatly
happy
in
the
possession
of
this
new
mistress
,
whose
fondness
would
have
quickly
surfeit
a
more
sickly
appetite
;
but
it
have
a
different
effect
on
mine
:
she
carry
my
passion
high
by
it
than
youth
or
beauty
have
be
able
.
<EOS>
but
my
happiness
could
not
long
continue
uninterrupted
.
<EOS>
the
apprehension
we
lay
under
from
the
jealousy
of
her
husband
give
us
great
uneasiness
.
"
<EOS>
poor
wretch
!
<EOS>
I
pity
him
,
"
cry
Adams
.
<EOS>
He
do
indeed
deserve
it
,
say
the
gentleman
;
for
he
love
his
wife
with
great
tenderness
;
and
,
I
assure
you
,
it
be
a
great
satisfaction
to
me
that
I
be
not
the
man
who
first
seduce
her
affection
from
him
.
<EOS>
these
apprehension
appear
also
too
well
ground
,
for
in
the
end
he
discover
us
,
and
procure
witness
of
our
caress
.
<EOS>
He
then
prosecute
me
at
law
,
and
recover
L3000
damage
,
which
much
distress
my
fortune
to
pay
;
and
,
what
be
bad
,
his
wife
,
be
divorce
,
come
upon
my
hand
.
<EOS>
I
lead
a
very
uneasy
life
with
her
;
for
,
besides
that
my
passion
be
now
much
abate
,
her
excessive
jealousy
be
very
troublesome
.
<EOS>
at
length
death
rid
me
of
an
inconvenience
which
the
consideration
of
my
have
be
the
author
of
her
misfortune
would
never
suffer
me
to
take
any
other
method
of
discard
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
bad
adieu
to
love
,
and
resolve
to
pursue
other
less
dangerous
and
expensive
pleasure
.
<EOS>
I
fall
into
the
acquaintance
of
a
set
of
jolly
companion
,
who
sleep
all
day
and
drank
all
night
;
fellow
who
may
rather
be
say
to
consume
time
than
to
live
.
<EOS>
Their
good
conversation
be
nothing
but
noise
:
singing
,
hollow
,
wrangle
,
drinking
,
toasting
,
sp
 
wing
<EOS>
,
smoaking
be
the
chief
ingredient
of
our
entertainment
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
bad
as
these
be
,
they
be
more
tolerable
than
our
graver
scene
,
which
be
either
excessive
tedious
narrative
of
dull
common
matter
of
fact
,
or
hot
dispute
about
trifle
matter
,
which
commonly
end
in
a
wager
.
<EOS>
this
way
of
life
the
first
serious
reflection
put
a
period
to
;
and
I
become
member
of
a
club
frequent
by
young
man
of
great
ability
.
<EOS>
the
bottle
be
now
only
call
in
to
the
assistance
of
our
conversation
,
which
roll
on
the
deep
point
of
philosophy
.
<EOS>
these
gentleman
be
engage
in
a
search
after
truth
,
in
the
pursuit
of
which
they
throw
aside
all
the
prejudice
of
education
,
and
govern
themselves
only
by
the
infallible
guide
of
human
reason
.
<EOS>
this
great
guide
,
after
have
show
them
the
falsehood
of
that
very
ancient
but
simple
tenet
,
that
there
be
such
a
being
as
a
Deity
in
the
universe
,
help
them
to
establish
in
his
stead
a
certain
rule
of
right
,
by
adhere
to
which
they
all
arrive
at
the
utmost
purity
of
moral
.
<EOS>
reflection
make
me
as
much
delighted
with
this
society
as
it
have
teach
me
to
despise
and
detest
the
former
.
<EOS>
I
begin
now
to
esteem
myself
a
being
of
a
high
order
than
I
have
ever
before
conceive
;
and
be
the
more
charm
with
this
rule
of
right
,
as
I
really
find
in
my
own
nature
nothing
repugnant
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
hold
in
utter
contempt
all
person
who
want
any
other
inducement
to
virtue
besides
her
intrinsic
beauty
and
excellence
;
and
have
so
high
an
opinion
of
my
present
companion
,
with
regard
to
their
morality
,
that
I
would
have
trust
them
with
whatever
be
near
and
dear
to
me
.
<EOS>
whilst
I
be
engage
in
this
delightful
dream
,
two
or
three
accident
happen
successively
,
which
at
first
much
surprize
me
;
 
for
one
of
our
great
philosopher
,
or
rule
-
of
-
right
man
,
withdraw
himself
from
us
,
take
with
him
the
wife
of
one
of
his
most
intimate
friend
.
<EOS>
secondly
,
another
of
the
same
society
leave
the
club
without
remember
to
take
leave
of
his
bail
.
<EOS>
a
third
,
have
borrow
a
sum
of
money
of
me
,
for
which
I
receive
no
security
,
when
I
ask
him
to
repay
it
,
absolutely
deny
the
loan
.
<EOS>
these
several
practice
,
so
inconsistent
with
our
golden
rule
,
make
me
begin
to
suspect
its
infallibility
;
but
when
I
communicate
my
thought
to
one
of
the
club
,
he
say
,
"
there
be
nothing
absolutely
good
or
evil
in
itself
;
that
action
be
denominate
good
or
bad
by
the
circumstance
of
the
agent
.
<EOS>
that
possibly
the
man
who
run
away
with
his
neighbour
's
wife
may
be
one
of
very
good
inclination
,
but
over
-
prevail
on
by
the
violence
of
an
unruly
passion
;
and
,
in
other
particular
,
may
be
a
very
worthy
member
of
society
;
that
if
the
beauty
of
any
woman
create
in
him
an
uneasiness
,
he
have
a
right
from
nature
to
relieve
himself
;
"
 
with
many
other
thing
,
which
I
then
detest
so
much
,
that
I
take
leave
of
the
society
that
very
evening
and
never
return
to
it
again
.
<EOS>
be
now
reduce
to
a
state
of
solitude
which
I
do
not
like
,
I
become
a
great
frequenter
of
the
playhouse
,
which
indeed
be
always
my
favourite
diversion
;
and
most
evening
pass
away
two
or
three
hour
behind
the
scene
,
where
I
meet
with
several
poet
,
with
whom
I
make
engagement
at
the
tavern
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
player
be
likewise
of
our
party
.
<EOS>
at
these
meeting
we
be
generally
entertain
by
the
poet
with
read
their
performance
,
and
by
the
player
with
repeat
their
part
:
upon
which
occasion
,
I
observe
the
gentleman
who
furnish
our
entertainment
be
commonly
the
best
pleased
of
the
company
;
who
,
though
they
be
pretty
civil
to
him
to
his
face
,
seldom
fail
to
take
the
first
opportunity
of
his
absence
to
ridicule
him
.
<EOS>
now
I
make
some
remark
which
probably
be
too
obvious
to
be
worth
relate
.
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
your
remark
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
first
then
,
say
he
,
I
conclude
that
the
general
observation
,
that
wit
be
most
inclined
to
vanity
,
be
not
true
.
<EOS>
man
be
equally
vain
of
rich
,
strength
,
beauty
,
honour
,
&
c.
<EOS>
but
these
appear
of
themselves
to
the
eye
of
the
beholder
,
whereas
the
poor
wit
be
oblige
to
produce
his
performance
to
show
you
his
perfection
;
and
on
his
readiness
to
do
this
that
vulgar
opinion
I
have
before
mention
be
ground
;
but
doth
not
the
person
who
expend
vast
sum
in
the
furniture
of
his
house
or
the
ornament
of
his
person
,
who
consume
much
time
and
employ
great
pain
in
dress
himself
,
or
who
think
himself
pay
for
self
-
denial
,
labour
,
or
even
villany
,
by
a
title
or
a
ribbon
,
sacrifice
as
much
to
vanity
as
the
poor
wit
who
be
desirous
to
read
you
his
poem
or
his
play
?
<EOS>
My
second
remark
be
,
that
vanity
be
the
bad
of
passion
,
and
more
apt
to
contaminate
the
mind
than
any
other
:
for
,
as
selfishness
be
much
more
general
than
we
please
to
allow
it
,
so
it
be
natural
to
hate
and
envy
those
who
stand
between
us
and
the
good
we
desire
.
<EOS>
now
,
in
lust
and
ambition
these
be
few
;
and
even
in
avarice
we
find
many
who
be
no
obstacle
to
our
pursuit
;
but
the
vain
man
seek
pre
-
eminence
;
and
everything
which
be
excellent
or
praiseworthy
in
another
render
him
the
mark
of
his
antipathy
.
<EOS>
Adams
now
begin
to
fumble
in
his
pocket
,
and
soon
cry
out
,
"
o
la
!
<EOS>
I
have
it
not
about
me
.
<EOS>
"
upon
this
,
the
gentleman
ask
him
what
he
be
search
for
,
he
say
he
search
after
a
sermon
,
which
he
think
his
masterpiece
,
against
vanity
.
<EOS>
"
fie
upon
it
,
fie
upon
it
!
"
<EOS>
cry
he
,
"
why
do
I
ever
leave
that
sermon
out
of
my
pocket
?
<EOS>
I
wish
it
be
within
five
mile
;
I
would
willingly
fetch
it
,
to
read
it
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
gentleman
answer
that
there
be
no
need
,
for
he
be
cure
of
the
passion
.
"
<EOS>
and
for
that
very
reason
,
"
quoth
Adams
,
"
I
would
read
it
,
for
I
be
confident
you
would
admire
it
:
indeed
,
I
have
never
be
a
great
enemy
to
any
passion
than
that
silly
one
of
vanity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
gentleman
smile
,
and
proceed
 
from
this
society
I
easily
pass
to
that
of
the
gamester
,
where
nothing
remarkable
happen
but
the
finish
my
fortune
,
which
those
gentleman
soon
help
me
to
the
end
of
.
<EOS>
this
open
scene
of
life
hitherto
unknown
;
poverty
and
distress
,
with
their
horrid
train
of
dun
,
attorney
,
bailiff
,
haunt
me
day
and
night
.
<EOS>
My
clothe
grow
shabby
,
my
credit
bad
,
my
friend
and
acquaintance
of
all
kind
cold
.
<EOS>
in
this
situation
the
strange
think
imaginable
come
into
my
head
;
and
what
be
this
but
to
write
a
play
?
<EOS>
for
I
have
sufficient
leisure
:
fear
of
bailiff
confine
me
every
day
to
my
room
:
and
,
have
always
have
a
little
inclination
and
something
of
a
genius
that
way
,
I
set
myself
to
work
,
and
within
a
few
month
produce
a
piece
of
five
act
,
which
be
accept
of
at
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
I
remember
to
have
formerly
take
ticket
of
other
poet
for
their
benefit
,
long
before
the
appearance
of
their
performance
;
and
,
resolve
to
follow
a
precedent
which
be
so
well
suited
to
my
present
circumstance
,
I
immediately
provide
myself
with
a
large
number
of
little
paper
.
<EOS>
happy
indeed
would
be
the
state
of
poetry
,
would
these
ticket
pass
current
at
the
bakehouse
,
the
ale
-
house
,
and
the
chandler
's
shop
:
but
alas
!
<EOS>
far
otherwise
;
no
taylor
will
take
them
in
payment
for
buckram
,
canvas
,
stay
-
tape
;
nor
no
bailiff
for
civility
money
.
<EOS>
They
be
,
indeed
,
no
more
than
a
passport
to
beg
with
;
a
certificate
that
the
owner
want
five
shilling
,
which
induce
well
-
dispose
Christians
to
charity
.
<EOS>
I
now
experience
what
be
bad
than
poverty
,
or
rather
what
be
the
bad
consequence
of
poverty
 
<EOS>
I
mean
attendance
and
dependance
on
the
great
.
<EOS>
many
a
morning
<EOS>
have
I
wait
hour
in
the
cold
parlour
of
man
of
quality
;
where
,
after
see
the
low
rascal
in
lace
and
embroidery
,
the
pimp
and
buffoon
in
fashion
,
admit
,
I
have
be
sometimes
tell
,
on
send
in
my
name
,
that
my
lord
could
not
possibly
see
me
this
morning
;
a
sufficient
assurance
that
I
should
never
more
get
entrance
into
that
house
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
have
be
at
last
admit
;
and
the
great
man
hath
think
proper
to
excuse
himself
,
by
tell
me
he
be
tie
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
tie
up
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
pray
what
be
that
?
"
<EOS>
Sir
,
say
the
gentleman
,
the
profit
which
bookseller
allow
author
for
the
good
work
be
so
very
small
,
that
certain
man
of
birth
and
fortune
some
year
ago
,
who
be
the
patron
of
wit
and
learning
,
think
fit
to
encourage
them
farther
by
enter
into
voluntary
subscription
for
their
encouragement
.
<EOS>
thus
prior
,
Rowe
,
Pope
,
and
some
other
man
of
genius
,
receive
large
sum
for
their
labour
from
the
public
.
<EOS>
this
seem
so
easy
a
method
of
get
money
,
that
many
of
the
low
scribbler
of
the
time
venture
to
publish
their
work
in
the
same
way
;
and
many
have
the
assurance
to
take
in
subscription
for
what
be
not
writ
,
nor
ever
intend
.
<EOS>
subscription
in
this
manner
grow
infinite
,
and
a
kind
of
tax
on
the
publick
,
some
person
,
find
it
not
so
easy
a
task
to
discern
good
from
bad
author
,
or
to
know
what
genius
be
worthy
encouragement
and
what
be
not
,
to
prevent
the
expense
of
subscribe
to
so
many
,
invent
a
method
to
excuse
themselves
from
all
subscription
whatever
;
and
this
be
to
receive
a
small
sum
of
money
in
consideration
of
give
a
large
one
if
ever
they
subscribe
;
which
many
have
do
,
and
many
more
have
pretend
to
have
do
,
in
order
to
silence
all
solicitation
.
<EOS>
the
same
method
be
likewise
take
with
playhouse
ticket
,
which
be
no
less
a
public
grievance
;
and
this
be
what
they
call
be
tie
up
from
subscribe
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
but
the
term
be
apt
enough
,
and
somewhat
typical
,
"
say
Adams
;
"
for
a
man
of
large
fortune
,
who
tie
himself
up
,
as
you
call
it
,
from
the
encouragement
of
man
of
merit
,
ought
to
be
tie
up
in
reality
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
say
the
gentleman
,
to
return
to
my
story
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
have
receive
a
guinea
from
a
man
of
quality
,
give
with
as
ill
a
grace
as
alm
be
generally
to
the
mean
beggar
;
and
purchase
too
with
as
much
time
spend
in
attendance
as
,
if
it
have
be
spend
in
honest
industry
,
may
have
bring
me
more
profit
with
infinitely
more
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
after
about
two
month
spend
in
this
disagreeable
way
,
with
the
utmost
mortification
,
when
I
be
plume
my
hope
on
the
prospect
of
a
plentiful
harvest
from
my
play
,
upon
apply
to
the
prompter
to
know
when
it
come
into
rehearsal
,
he
inform
me
he
have
receive
order
from
the
manager
to
return
me
the
play
again
,
for
that
they
could
not
possibly
act
it
that
season
;
but
,
if
I
would
take
it
and
revise
it
against
the
next
,
they
would
be
glad
to
see
it
again
.
<EOS>
I
snatch
it
from
him
with
great
indignation
,
and
retire
to
my
room
,
where
I
throw
myself
on
the
bed
in
a
fit
of
despair
.
<EOS>
"
You
should
rather
have
throw
yourself
on
your
knee
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
for
despair
be
sinful
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
soon
,
continue
the
gentleman
,
as
I
have
indulge
the
first
tumult
of
my
passion
,
I
begin
to
consider
coolly
what
course
I
should
take
,
in
a
situation
without
friend
,
money
,
credit
,
or
reputation
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
after
revolve
many
thing
in
my
mind
,
I
could
see
no
other
possibility
of
furnish
myself
with
the
miserable
necessary
of
life
than
to
retire
to
a
garret
near
the
Temple
,
and
commence
hackney
-
writer
to
the
lawyer
,
for
which
I
be
well
qualified
,
be
an
excellent
penman
.
<EOS>
this
purpose
I
resolve
on
,
and
immediately
put
it
in
execution
.
<EOS>
I
have
an
acquaintance
with
an
attorney
who
have
formerly
transact
affair
for
me
,
and
to
him
I
apply
;
but
,
instead
of
furnish
me
with
any
business
,
he
laugh
at
my
undertaking
,
and
tell
me
,
"
He
be
afraid
I
should
turn
his
deed
into
play
,
and
he
should
expect
to
see
them
on
the
stage
.
"
not
to
tire
you
with
instance
of
this
kind
from
other
,
I
find
that
Plato
himself
do
not
hold
poet
in
great
abhorrence
than
these
man
of
business
do
.
<EOS>
whenever
I
durst
venture
to
a
coffeehouse
,
which
be
on
Sundays
<EOS>
only
,
a
whisper
run
round
the
room
,
which
be
constantly
attend
with
a
sneer
 
<EOS>
that
be
poet
Wilson
;
for
I
know
not
whether
you
have
observe
it
,
but
there
be
a
malignity
in
the
nature
of
man
,
which
,
when
not
weed
out
,
or
at
least
cover
by
a
good
education
and
politeness
,
delight
in
make
another
uneasy
or
dissatisfied
with
himself
.
<EOS>
this
abundantly
appear
in
all
assembly
,
except
those
which
be
fill
by
people
of
fashion
,
and
especially
among
the
young
people
of
both
sex
whose
birth
and
fortune
place
them
just
without
the
polite
circle
;
I
mean
the
low
class
of
the
gentry
,
and
the
high
of
the
mercantile
world
,
who
be
,
in
reality
,
the
worst
-
breed
part
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
whilst
I
continue
in
this
miserable
state
,
with
scarce
sufficient
business
to
keep
me
from
starve
,
the
reputation
of
a
poet
be
my
bane
,
I
accidentally
become
acquainted
with
a
bookseller
,
who
tell
me
,
"
It
be
a
pity
a
man
of
my
learning
and
genius
should
be
oblige
to
such
a
method
of
get
his
livelihood
;
that
he
have
a
compassion
for
me
,
and
,
if
I
would
engage
with
him
,
he
would
undertake
to
provide
handsomely
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
man
in
my
circumstance
,
as
he
very
well
know
,
have
no
choice
.
<EOS>
I
accordingly
accept
his
proposal
with
his
condition
,
which
be
none
of
the
most
favourable
,
and
fall
to
translate
with
all
my
might
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
long
reason
to
lament
the
want
of
business
;
for
he
furnish
me
with
so
much
,
that
in
half
a
year
I
almost
writ
myself
blind
.
<EOS>
I
likewise
contract
a
distemper
by
my
sedentary
life
,
in
which
no
part
of
my
body
be
exercise
but
my
right
arm
,
which
render
me
incapable
of
write
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
this
unluckily
happen
to
delay
the
publication
of
a
work
,
and
my
last
performance
not
have
sell
well
,
the
bookseller
decline
any
further
engagement
,
and
asperse
me
to
his
brother
as
a
careless
idle
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
however
,
by
have
half
worked
and
half
starve
myself
to
death
during
the
time
I
be
in
his
service
,
save
a
few
guinea
,
with
which
I
buy
a
lottery
-
ticket
,
resolve
to
throw
myself
into
Fortune
's
lap
,
and
try
if
she
would
make
me
amend
for
the
injury
she
have
do
me
at
the
gaming
-
table
.
<EOS>
this
purchase
,
be
make
,
leave
me
almost
pennyless
;
when
,
as
if
I
have
not
be
sufficiently
miserable
,
a
bailiff
in
woman
's
clothe
get
admittance
to
my
chamber
,
whither
he
be
direct
by
the
bookseller
.
<EOS>
He
arrest
me
at
my
taylor
's
suit
for
thirty
-
five
pound
;
a
sum
for
which
I
could
not
procure
bail
;
and
be
therefore
convey
to
his
house
,
where
I
be
lock
up
in
an
upper
chamber
.
<EOS>
I
have
now
neither
health
(
for
I
be
scarce
recover
from
my
indisposition
)
,
liberty
,
money
,
or
friend
;
and
have
abandon
all
hope
,
and
even
the
desire
,
of
life
.
"
<EOS>
but
this
could
not
last
long
,
"
say
Adams
;
"
for
doubtless
the
taylor
release
you
the
moment
he
be
truly
acquaint
with
your
affair
,
and
know
that
your
circumstance
would
not
permit
you
to
pay
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
oh
,
sir
,
"
answer
the
gentleman
,
"
he
know
that
before
he
arrest
me
;
nay
,
he
know
that
nothing
but
incapacity
could
prevent
me
pay
my
debt
;
for
I
have
be
his
customer
many
year
,
have
spend
vast
sum
of
money
with
him
,
and
have
always
pay
most
punctually
in
my
prosperous
day
;
but
when
I
remind
him
of
this
,
with
assurance
that
,
if
he
would
not
molest
my
endeavour
,
I
would
pay
him
all
the
money
I
could
by
my
utmost
labour
and
industry
procure
,
reserve
only
what
be
sufficient
to
preserve
me
alive
,
he
answer
,
his
patience
be
wear
out
;
that
I
have
put
him
off
from
time
to
time
;
that
he
want
the
money
;
that
he
have
put
it
into
a
lawyer
's
hand
;
and
if
I
do
not
pay
him
immediately
,
or
find
security
,
I
must
die
in
gaol
and
expect
no
mercy
.
"
<EOS>
"
He
may
expect
mercy
,
"
cry
Adams
,
start
from
his
chair
,
"
where
he
will
find
none
!
<EOS>
how
can
such
a
wretch
repeat
the
Lord
's
Prayer
;
where
the
word
,
which
be
translate
,
I
know
not
for
what
reason
,
trespass
,
be
in
the
original
,
debt
?
<EOS>
and
as
surely
as
we
do
not
forgive
other
their
debt
,
when
they
be
unable
to
pay
them
,
so
surely
shall
we
ourselves
be
unforgiven
when
we
be
in
no
condition
of
pay
.
"
<EOS>
He
cease
,
and
the
gentleman
proceed
.
<EOS>
while
I
be
in
this
deplorable
situation
,
a
former
acquaintance
,
to
whom
I
have
communicate
my
lottery
-
ticket
,
find
me
out
,
and
,
make
me
a
visit
,
with
great
delight
in
his
countenance
,
shake
me
heartily
by
the
hand
,
and
wish
me
joy
of
my
good
fortune
:
for
,
say
he
,
your
ticket
be
come
up
a
prize
of
L3000
.
<EOS>
Adams
snap
his
finger
at
these
word
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy
;
which
,
however
,
do
not
continue
long
;
for
the
gentleman
thus
proceed
:
 
alas
!
<EOS>
sir
,
this
be
only
a
trick
of
Fortune
to
sink
me
the
deep
;
for
I
have
dispose
of
this
lottery
-
ticket
two
day
before
to
a
relation
,
who
refuse
lend
me
a
shilling
without
it
,
in
order
to
procure
myself
bread
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
my
friend
be
acquaint
with
my
unfortunate
sale
he
begin
to
revile
me
and
remind
me
of
all
the
ill
-
conduct
and
miscarriage
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
He
say
I
be
one
whom
Fortune
could
not
save
if
she
would
;
that
I
be
now
ruin
without
any
hope
of
retrieval
,
nor
must
expect
any
pity
from
my
friend
;
that
it
would
be
extreme
weakness
to
compassionate
the
misfortune
of
a
man
who
run
headlong
to
his
own
destruction
.
<EOS>
He
then
paint
to
me
,
in
as
lively
colour
as
he
be
able
,
the
happiness
I
should
have
now
enjoy
,
have
I
not
foolishly
disposed
of
my
ticket
.
<EOS>
I
urge
the
plea
of
necessity
;
but
he
make
no
answer
to
that
,
and
begin
again
to
revile
me
,
till
I
could
bear
it
no
longer
,
and
desire
him
to
finish
his
visit
.
<EOS>
I
soon
exchange
the
bailiff
's
house
for
a
prison
;
where
,
as
I
have
not
money
sufficient
to
procure
me
a
separate
apartment
,
I
be
croude
in
with
a
great
number
of
miserable
wretch
,
in
common
with
whom
I
be
destitute
of
every
convenience
of
life
,
even
that
which
all
the
brute
enjoy
,
wholesome
air
.
<EOS>
in
these
dreadful
circumstance
I
apply
by
letter
to
several
of
my
old
acquaintance
,
and
such
to
whom
I
have
formerly
lend
money
without
any
great
prospect
of
its
be
return
,
for
their
assistance
;
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
an
excuse
,
instead
of
a
denial
,
be
the
gentle
answer
I
receive
.
<EOS>
whilst
I
languish
in
a
condition
too
horrible
to
be
describe
,
and
which
,
in
a
land
of
humanity
,
and
,
what
be
much
more
,
Christianity
,
seem
a
strange
punishment
for
a
little
inadvertency
and
indiscretion
;
whilst
I
be
in
this
condition
,
a
fellow
come
into
the
prison
,
and
,
enquire
me
out
,
deliver
me
the
following
letter
:
        
<EOS>
"
SIR
,
 
My
father
,
to
whom
you
sell
your
ticket
in
the
last
    
lottery
,
die
the
same
day
in
which
it
come
up
a
prize
,
as
you
    
have
possibly
hear
,
and
leave
me
sole
heiress
of
all
his
    
fortune
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
much
touch
with
your
present
circumstance
,
    
and
the
uneasiness
you
must
feel
at
have
be
drive
to
    
dispose
of
what
may
have
make
you
happy
,
that
I
must
desire
    
your
acceptance
of
the
enclose

be
your
humble
servant

HARRIET
HEARTY

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
what
do
you
think
be
enclose
?
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
cry
Adams
;
"
not
less
than
a
guinea
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
it
be
a
bank
-
note
for
L200
.
 
<EOS>
"
L200
?
<EOS>
"
say
Adams
,
in
a
rapture
.
<EOS>
no
less
,
I
assure
you
,
answer
the
gentleman
;
a
sum
<EOS>
I
be
not
half
so
delighted
with
as
with
the
dear
name
of
the
generous
girl
that
send
it
me
;
and
who
be
not
only
the
good
but
<EOS>
the
handsome
creature
in
the
universe
,
and
for
whom
I
have
long
have
a
passion
which
I
never
durst
disclose
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
kiss
her
name
a
thousand
time
,
my
eye
overflow
with
tenderness
and
gratitude
;
I
repeat
 
but
not
to
detain
you
with
these
rapture
,
I
immediately
acquire
my
liberty
;
and
,
have
pay
all
my
debt
,
depart
,
with
upward
of
fifty
pound
in
my
pocket
,
to
thank
my
kind
deliverer
.
<EOS>
She
happen
to
be
then
out
of
town
,
a
circumstance
which
,
upon
reflection
,
please
me
;
for
by
that
mean
I
have
an
opportunity
to
appear
before
her
in
a
more
decent
dress
.
<EOS>
at
her
return
to
town
,
within
a
day
or
two
,
I
throw
myself
at
her
foot
with
the
most
ardent
acknowledgment
,
which
she
reject
with
an
unfeigned
greatness
of
mind
,
and
tell
me
I
could
not
oblige
her
more
than
by
never
mention
,
or
<EOS>
if
possible
think
on
,
a
circumstance
which
must
bring
to
my
mind
an
accident
that
may
be
grievous
to
me
to
think
on
.
<EOS>
She
proceed
thus
:
"
what
I
have
do
be
in
my
own
eye
a
trifle
,
and
perhaps
infinitely
less
than
would
have
become
me
to
do
.
<EOS>
and
if
you
think
of
engage
in
any
business
where
a
large
sum
may
be
serviceable
to
you
,
I
shall
not
be
over
-
rigid
either
as
to
the
security
or
interest
.
<EOS>
"
I
endeavour
to
express
all
the
gratitude
in
my
power
to
this
profusion
of
goodness
,
though
perhaps
it
be
my
enemy
,
and
begin
to
afflict
my
mind
with
more
agony
than
all
the
misery
I
have
undergo
;
it
affect
me
with
severer
reflection
than
poverty
,
distress
,
and
prison
united
have
be
able
to
make
me
feel
;
for
,
sir
,
these
act
and
profession
of
kindness
,
which
be
sufficient
to
have
raise
in
a
good
heart
the
most
violent
passion
of
friendship
to
one
of
the
same
,
or
to
age
and
ugliness
in
a
different
sex
,
come
to
me
from
a
woman
,
a
young
and
beautiful
woman
;
one
whose
perfection
I
have
long
know
,
and
for
whom
I
have
long
conceive
a
violent
passion
,
though
with
a
despair
which
make
me
endeavour
rather
to
curb
and
conceal
,
than
to
nourish
or
acquaint
her
with
it
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
they
come
upon
me
unite
with
beauty
,
softness
,
and
tenderness
:
such
bewitching
smile
!
 
<EOS>
o
Mr
Adams
,
in
that
moment
I
lose
myself
,
and
,
forget
our
different
situation
,
nor
consider
what
return
I
be
make
to
her
goodness
by
desire
her
,
who
have
give
me
so
much
,
to
bestow
her
all
,
I
lay
gently
hold
on
her
hand
,
and
,
convey
it
to
my
lip
<EOS>
,
I
prest
it
with
inconceivable
ardour
;
then
,
lift
up
my
swimming
eye
,
I
see
her
face
and
neck
overspread
with
one
blush
;
she
offer
to
withdraw
her
hand
,
yet
not
so
as
to
deliver
it
from
mine
,
though
I
hold
it
with
the
gentle
force
.
<EOS>
We
both
stand
tremble
;
her
eye
cast
on
the
ground
,
and
mine
stedfastly
fix
on
her

<EOS>
good
G####d
<EOS>

what
be
then
the
condition

my
soul

burn
with
love

admiration

gratitude

every
tender
passion

all
bent
on

passion
at
last
get
the

softly
let
go
her
hand
,
I
offer
madly
to
clasp
her
in
my
arm
;
when
,
a
little
recover
herself
,
she
start
from
me
,
ask
me
,
with
some
show
of
anger
,
"
if
she
have
any
reason
to
expect
this
treatment
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
then
fall
prostrate
before
her
,
and
tell
her
,
if
I
have
offend
,
my
life
be
absolutely
in
her
power
,
which
I
would
in
any
manner
lose
for
her
sake
.
<EOS>
nay
,
madam
,
say
I
,
you
shall
not
be
so
ready
to
punish
me
as
I
to
suffer
.
<EOS>
I
own
my
guilt
.
<EOS>
I
detest
the
reflection
that
I
would
have
sacrifice
your
happiness
to
mine
.
<EOS>
believe
me
,
I
sincerely
repent
my
ingratitude
;
yet
,
believe
me
too
,
it
be
my
passion
,
my
unbounded
passion
for
you
,
which
hurry
me
so
far
:
I
have
love
you
long
and
tenderly
,
and
the
goodness
you
have
show
me
hath
innocently
weigh
down
a
wretch
undo
before
.
<EOS>
acquit
me
of
all
mean
,
mercenary
view
;
and
,
before
I
take
my
leave
of
you
for
ever
,
which
I
be
resolve
instantly
to
do
,
believe
me
that
Fortune
could
have
raise
me
to
no
height
to
which
I
could
not
have
gladly
lift
you
.
<EOS>
o

curst
be
Fortune

<EOS>
"
do
not

she

interrupt
me
with
the
sweetest
voice

"
do
not
curse
Fortune

since
she
hath
make
me
happy

and
,
if
she
hath
put
your
happiness
in
my
power
<EOS>
,
I
have
tell
you
you
shall
ask
nothing

I
will
refuse

<EOS>
"
Madam
,
say
I
,
you
mistake
me
if
you
imagine
,
as
you
seem
,
my
happiness
be
in
the
power
of
Fortune
now
.
<EOS>
You
have
oblige
me
too
much
already
;
if
I
have
any
wish
,
it
be
for
some
bl
accident
,
by
which
I
may
contribute
with
my
life
to
the
least
augmentation
of
your
felicity
.
<EOS>
as
for
myself
,
the
only
happiness
I
can
ever
have
will
be
hear
of
yours
;
and
if
Fortune
will
make
that
complete
,
I
will
forgive
her
all
her
wrong
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
,
indeed
,
"
answer
she
,
smile
,
"
for
your
own
happiness
must
be
include
in
mine

<EOS>
I
have
long
know
your
worth
;
nay
,
I
must
confess
,
"
say
she
,
blush
,
"
I
have
long
discover
that
passion
for
me
you
profess
,
notwithstanding
those
endeavour
,
which
I
be
convince
be
unaffected
,
to
conceal
it
;
and
if
all
I
can
give
with
reason
will
not
suffice
,
take
reason
away
;
and
now
I
believe
you
can
not
ask
me
what
I
will
deny
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
utter
these
word
with
a
sweetness
not
to
be
imagine
.
<EOS>
I
immediately
start
;
my
blood
,
which
lie
freeze
at
my
heart
,
rush
tumultuously
through
every
vein
.
<EOS>
I
stand
for
a
moment
silent
;
then
,
fly
to
her
,
I
catch
her
in
my
arm
,
no
longer
resist
,
and
softly
tell
her
she
must
give
me
then
herself
.
<EOS>
o
,
sir
!
<EOS>
can
I
describe
her
look
?
<EOS>
She
remain
silent
,
and
almost
motionless
,
several
minute
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
recover
herself
a
little
,
she
insist
on
my
leave
her
,
and
in
such
a
manner
that
I
instantly
obey
:
you
may
imagine
,
however
,
I
soon
see
her
again
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
ask
pardon
:
<EOS>
I
fear
I
have
detain
you
too
long
in
relate
the
particular
of
the
former
interview
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
far
otherwise
,
"
say
Adams
,
lick
his
lip
,
"
that
I
could
willingly
hear
it
over
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
continue
the
gentleman
,
to
be
as
concise
as
possible
,
<EOS>
within
a
week
she
consent
to
make
me
the
happy
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
We
be
marry
shortly
after
;
and
when
I
come
to
examine
the
circumstance
of
my
wife
's
fortune
(
which
,
I
do
assure
you
,
I
be
not
presently
at
leisure
enough
to
do
)
,
I
find
it
amount
to
about
six
thousand
pound
,
most
part
of
which
lie
in
effect
;
for
her
father
have
be
a
wine
-
merchant
,
and
she
seem
willing
,
if
I
like
it
,
that
I
should
carry
on
the
same
trade
.
<EOS>
I
readily
,
and
too
inconsiderately
,
undertake
it
;
for
,
not
have
be
breed
up
to
the
secret
of
the
business
,
and
endeavour
to
deal
with
the
utmost
honesty
and
uprightness
<EOS>
,
I
soon
find
our
fortune
in
a
decline
way
,
and
my
trade
decrease
by
little
and
little
;
for
my
wine
,
which
I
never
adulterate
after
their
importation
,
and
be
sell
as
neat
as
they
come
over
,
be
universally
decry
by
the
vintner
,
to
whom
I
could
not
allow
them
quite
as
cheap
as
those
who
gain
double
the
profit
by
a
less
price
.
<EOS>
I
soon
begin
to
despair
of
improve
our
fortune
by
these
mean
;
nor
be
I
at
all
easy
at
the
visit
and
familiarity
of
many
who
have
be
my
acquaintance
in
my
prosperity
,
but
have
deny
and
shun
me
in
my
adversity
,
and
now
very
forwardly
renew
their
acquaintance
with
me
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
have
sufficiently
see
that
the
pleasure
of
the
world
be
chiefly
folly
,
and
the
business
of
it
mostly
knavery
,
and
both
nothing
well
than
vanity
;
the
man
of
pleasure
tear
one
another
to
piece
from
the
emulation
of
spend
money
,
and
the
man
of
business
from
envy
in
get
it
.
<EOS>
My
happiness
consist
entirely
in
my
wife
,
whom
I
love
with
an
inexpressible
fondness
,
which
be
perfectly
return
;
and
my
prospect
be
no
other
than
to
provide
for
our
grow
family
;
for
she
be
now
big
of
her
second
child
<EOS>
:
I
therefore
take
an
opportunity
to
ask
her
opinion
of
enter
into
a
retire
life
,
which
,
after
hear
my
reason
and
perceive
my
affection
for
it
,
she
readily
embrace
.
<EOS>
We
soon
put
our
small
fortune
,
now
reduce
under
three
thousand
pound
,
into
money
,
with
part
of
which
we
purchase
this
little
place
,
whither
we
retire
soon
after
her
delivery
,
from
a
world
full
of
bustle
,
noise
,
hatred
,
envy
,
and
ingratitude
,
to
ease
,
quiet
,
and
love
.
<EOS>
We
have
here
live
almost
twenty
year
,
with
little
other
conversation
than
our
own
,
most
of
the
neighbourhood
take
us
for
very
strange
people
;
the
squire
of
the
parish
represent
me
as
a
madman
,
and
the
parson
as
a
presbyterian
,
because
I
will
not
hunt
with
the
one
nor
drink
with
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
Fortune
hath
,
I
think
,
pay
you
all
her
debt
in
this
sweet
retirement
.
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
reply
the
gentleman
,
I
be
thankful
to
the
great
author
of
all
thing
for
the
blessing
I
here
enjoy
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
good
of
wife
,
and
three
pretty
child
,
for
whom
I
have
the
true
tenderness
of
a
parent
.
<EOS>
but
no
blessing
be
pure
in
this
world
:
within
three
year
of
my
arrival
here
I
lose
my
eld
son
.
<EOS>
(
here
he
sigh
bitterly
.
)
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
we
must
submit
to
Providence
,
and
consider
death
as
common
to
all
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
submit
,
indeed
,
answer
the
gentleman
;
and
if
he
have
die
I
could
have
bear
the
loss
with
patience
;
but
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
sir
,
he
be
steal
away
from
my
door
by
some
wicked
travel
people
whom
they
call
gipsy
;
nor
could
I
ever
,
with
the
most
diligent
search
,
recover
him
.
<EOS>
poor
child
!
<EOS>
he
have
the
sweetest
look
 
<EOS>
the
exact
picture
of
his
mother
;
at
which
some
tear
unwittingly
dropt
from
his
eye
,
as
do
likewise
from
those
of
Adams
,
who
always
sympathize
with
his
friend
on
those
occasion
.
<EOS>
thus
,
sir
,
say
the
gentleman
,
I
have
finish
my
story
,
in
which
if
I
have
be
too
particular
,
I
ask
your
pardon
;
and
now
,
if
you
please
,
I
will
fetch
you
another
bottle

which
proposal
the

thankfully
accept

<EOS>
the
gentleman
return
with
the
bottle
;
and
<EOS>
Adams
and
he
sit
some
time
silent
,
when
the
former
start
up
,
and
cry
,
"
no
,
that
will
not
do
.
"
<EOS>
the
gentleman
inquire
into
his
meaning
;
he
answer
,
"
He
have
be
consider
that
it
be
possible
the
late
famous
king
Theodore
may
have
be
that
very
son
whom
he
have

that

<EOS>
however
,
"
say
he
,
"
g

dispose
all
thing
for

very
probably
he

and
may

one
day
or
other

revisit
you
in

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
gentleman
answer
,
he
should
know
him
amongst
ten

for
he
have
a

on

begin
to
take
her
early
walk
over
the
eastern
hill
;
and
presently
after
,
that
gallant
person
the
Sun
steal
softly
from
his
wife
's
chamber
to
pay
his
address
to
her
;
when
the
gentleman
ask
his
guest
if
he
would
walk
forth
and
survey
his
little
garden
,
which
he
readily
agree
to
,
and
Joseph
at
the
same
time
awake
from
a
sleep
in
which
he
have

go
with

<EOS>
no
parterre
,
no

,
no

,
embellish
this
little
garden
.
<EOS>
Its
only
ornament
be
a
short
walk
,
shade
on
each
side
by
a
filbert
-
hedge
,
with
a
small
alcove
at
one
end
,
whither
in
hot
weather
the
gentleman
and
his
wife
use
to
retire
and
divert
themselves
with
their
child
,
who
play
in
the
walk
before
them
.
<EOS>
but
,
though
vanity
have
no
votary
in
this
little
spot
,
here
be
variety
of
fruit
and
everything
useful
for
the
kitchen
,
which
be
abundantly
sufficient
to
catch
the
admiration
of
Adams
,
who
tell
the
gentleman
he
have
certainly
a
good
gardener
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
answer
he
,
that
gardener
be
now
before
you
:
whatever
you
see
here
be
the
work
solely
of
my
own
hand
.
<EOS>
whilst
I
be
provide
necessary
for
my
table
,
I
likewise
procure
myself
an
appetite
for
them
.
<EOS>
in
fair
season
I
seldom
pass
less
than
six
hour
of
the
twenty
-
four
in
this
place
,
where
I
be
not
idle
;
and
by
these
mean
I
have
be
able
to
preserve
my
health
ever
since
my
arrival
here
,
without
assistance
from
physic
.
<EOS>
hither
I
generally
repair
at
the
dawn
,
and
exercise
myself
whilst
<EOS>
my
wife
dress
her
child
and
prepare
our
breakfast
;
after
which
we
be
seldom
asunder
during
the
residue
of
the
day
,
for
,
when
the
weather
will
not
permit
them
to
accompany
me
here
,
I
be
usually
within
with
them
;
for
I
be
neither
ashamed
of
converse
with
my
wife
nor
of
play
with
my
child
:
to
say
the
truth
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
perceive
that
inferiority
of
understanding
which
the
levity
of
rake
,
the
dulness
of
man
of
business
,
or
the
austerity
of
the
learn
,
would
persuade
us
of
in
woman
.
<EOS>
as
for
my
woman
,
I
declare
I
have
find
none
of
my
own
sex
capable
of
make
juster
observation
on
life
,
or
of
deliver
them
more
agreeably
;
nor
do
I
believe
any
one
possess
of
a
faithfuller
or
braver
friend
.
<EOS>
and
sure
as
this
friendship
be
sweeten
with
more
delicacy
and
tenderness
,
so
be
it
confirm
by
dearer
pledge
than
can
attend
the
close
male
alliance
;
for
what
union
can
be
so
fast
as
our
common
interest
in
the
fruit
of
our
embrace
?
<EOS>
perhaps
,
sir
,
you
be
not
yourself
a
father
;
if
you
be
not
,
be
assure
you
can
not
conceive
the
delight
I
have
in
my
little
one
.
<EOS>
Would
you
not
despise
me
if
you
see
me
stretched
on
the
ground
,
and
my
child
play
round
me
?
<EOS>
"
I
should
reverence
the
sight
,
"
quoth
Adams
;
"
I
myself
be
now
the
father
of
six
,
and
have
be
of
eleven
,
and
<EOS>
I
can
say
I
never
scourge
a
child
of
my
own
,
unless
as
his
schoolmaster
,
and
then
have
feel
every
stroke
on
my
own
posterior
.
<EOS>
and
as
to
what
you
say
concern
woman
,
I
have
often
lament
my
own
wife
do
not
understand
Greek
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
gentleman
smile
,
and
answer
,
he
would
not
be
apprehend
to
insinuate
that
his
own
have
an
understanding
above
the
care
of
her
family
;
on
the
contrary
,
say
he
,
my
Harriet
,
I
assure
you
,
be
a
notable
housewife
,
and
few
gentleman
's
housekeeper
understand
cookery
or
confectionery
better
;
but
these
be
art
which
she
hath
no
great
occasion
for
now
:
however
,
the
wine
you
commend
so
much
last
night
at
supper
be
of
her
own
making
,
as
be
indeed
all
the
liquor
in
my
house
,
except
my
beer
,
which
fall
to
my
province
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
assure
you
it
be
as
excellent
,
"
quoth
Adams
,
"
as
ever
I
taste
.
<EOS>
"
We
formerly
keep
a
maid
-
servant
,
but
since
my
girl
have
be
grow
up
she
be
unwilling
to
indulge
them
in
idleness
;
for
as
the
fortune
I
shall
give
them
will
be
very
small
,
we
intend
not
to
breed
them
above
the
rank
they
be
likely
to
fill
hereafter
,
nor
to
teach
them
to
despise
or
ruin
a
plain
husband
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
could
wish
a
man
of
my
own
temper
,
and
a
retire
life
,
may
fall
to
their
lot
;
for
I
have
experience
that
calm
serene
happiness
,
which
be
seat
in
content
,
be
inconsistent
with
the
hurry
and
bustle
of

They

the
eldest
acquaint
her
father
,
that
her
mother
and
the
young
gentlewoman
be
up

and
that
breakfast
be
ready

<EOS>
They
all
go

where

surprize
at
the

of

if

behaviour
of

<EOS>
these
instance
please
the

dispose

of
Adams
equally
with
the
readiness
which
they
exprest
to
oblige
their

,
and
their
forwardness
to
offer
them
the
good
of
everything
in
their
house
;
and
what
delight
him
still
more
be
an
instance
or
two
of
their
charity
;
for
whilst
they
be
at
breakfast
the

be
call
for
to
assist
her
sick
neighbour
,
which
she
do
with
some
cordial

the
good
man
go
into
his
garden
at
the

time
to
supply
another

something
which
he
want
thence

<EOS>
these

be
in
the

when
they
hear
the

of

afterwards

come
limp

lay
himself
at

:
the
poor

,
who
be
about
eleven
year
old
,
burst
into
tear
at
the
sight
;
and
presently
one
of

come
in
and
inform
them
that
the
young

,
the
son
of
the
lord
of

She
exprest
great

whilst

He

emphasis

this
squire
have
endeavour
to
kill
the
little
wretch
,
and
have
wound
him
smartly
once
before

add
,
he
could
have
no
motive
but
ill

for
the
little

He
say
he
have
do
nothing

but
his
father
have
too
great
a
fortune
to
contend
with
:
that
he
be
as
absolute
as
any
tyrant
in

and
have
kill
all
the

and
take
away
all

not

he
trample
down

and
ride
over

with
no
more

<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
catch
him
in

"
say
Adams

"
though
I
would
rather
forgive
him

a

not

to
them
both

<EOS>
Our
traveller
,
have
well
refresh
themselves
at
the
gentleman
's
house
,
Joseph
and
Fanny
with
sleep
,
and
Mr
Abraham
Adams
with
ale

tobacco
,
renew
their

with
great
alacrity

and
pursue
the
road
into
which
they
be
direct
,
travel
many
mile
before
they
meet
with
any
adventure
worth

<EOS>
in
this
interval
we
shall
present
our
reader
with
a
very
curious
discourse
,
as
we
apprehend
it
,
concern
public
school
,
which
pass
between
Mr
Joseph
Andrews
and
Mr
Abraham
Adams
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
not
go
far
before
Adams
,
call
to
Joseph
,
ask
him
,
"
if
he
have
attend
to
the
gentleman
's
story
?
"
<EOS>
He
answer
,
"
to
all
the
former
part
.
"
 
"
and
do
not
you
think
,
"
say
he
,
"
he
be
a
very
unhappy
man
in
his
youth
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
very
unhappy
man
,
indeed
,
"
answer
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Joseph
,
"
cry
Adams
,
screw
up
his
mouth
,
"
I
have
find
it
;
I
have
discover
the
cause
of
all
the
misfortune
which
befel
him
:
a
public
school
,
Joseph
,
be
the
cause
of
all
the
calamity
which
he
afterwards
suffer
.
<EOS>
public
school
be
the
nursery
of
all
vice
and
immorality
.
<EOS>
all
the
wicked
fellow
whom
I
remember
at
the
university
be
breed
at
them
.
 
<EOS>
ah
,
Lord
!
<EOS>
I
can
remember
as
well
as
if
it
be
but
<EOS>
yesterday
,
a
knot
of
them
;
they
call
them
King
's
scholar
,
I
forget
why
 
very
wicked
fellow
!
<EOS>
Joseph
,
you
may
thank
the
Lord
you
be
not
breed
at
a
public
school
;
you
would
never
have
preserve
your
virtue
as
you
have
.
<EOS>
the
first
care
I
always
take
be
of
a
boy
's
moral
;
I
have
rather
he
should
be
a
blockhead
than
an
atheist
or
a
presbyterian
.
<EOS>
what
be
all
the
learning
in
the
world
compare
to
his
immortal
soul
?
<EOS>
what
shall
a
man
take
in
exchange
for
his
soul
?
<EOS>
but
the
master
of
great
school
trouble
themselves
about
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
a
lad
of
eighteen
at
the
university
,
who
hath
not
be
able
to
say
his
catechism
;
but
for
my
own
part
,
I
always
scourge
a
lad
sooner
for
miss
that
than
any
other
lesson
.
<EOS>
believe
me
,
child
,
all
that
gentleman
's
misfortune
arise
from
his
be
educate
at
a
public
school
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
doth
not
become
me
,
"
answer
Joseph
,
"
to
dispute
anything
,
sir
,
with
you
,
especially
a
matter
of
this
kind
;
for
to
be
sure
you
must
be
allow
by
all
the
world
to
be
the
good
teacher
of
a
school
in
all
our
county
.
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
that
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
I
believe
,
be
grant
me
;
that
I
may
without
much
vanity
pretend
to
 
nay
,
I
believe
I
may
go
to
the
next
county
too
 
but
gloriari
non

meum
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
however
,
sir
,
as
you
be
pleased
to
bid
me
speak
,
"
say
Joseph
,
"
you
know
my
late
master
,
Sir
Thomas
Booby
,
be
breed
at
a
public
school
,
and
he
be
the
fine
gentleman
in
all
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
and
I
have
often
hear
him
say
,
if
he
have
a
hundred
boy
he
would
breed
them
all
at
the
same
place
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
opinion
,
and
I
have
often
hear
him
deliver
it
,
that
a
boy
take
from
a
public
school
and
carry
into
the
world
,
will
learn
more
in
one
year
there
than
one
of
a
private
education
will
in
five
.
<EOS>
He
use
to
say
the
school
itself
initiate
him
a
great
way
<EOS>
(
I
remember
that
be
his
very
expression
)
,
for
great
school
be
little
society
,
where
a
boy
of
any
observation
may
see
in
epitome
what
he
will
afterwards
find
in
the
world
at
large
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hinc
illae
lachrymae
:
<EOS>
for
that
very
reason
,
"
quoth
Adams
,
"
I
prefer
a
private
school
,
where
boy
may
be
keep
in
innocence
and
ignorance
;
for
,
accord
to
that
fine
passage
in
the
play
of
Cato
,
the
only
english
tragedy
I
ever
read
       
"
<EOS>
"
if
knowledge
of

must
make

villain
    
May
Juba
ever
live

ignorance

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
would
not
rather
preserve
the
purity
of
his
child
than
wish
him
to
attain
the
whole
circle
of
art
and
science
?
<EOS>
which
,
by
the
bye
,
he
may
learn
in
the
class
of
a
private
school
;
for
I
would
not
be
vain
,
but
I
esteem
myself
to
be
second
to
none
,
nulli
secundum
,
in
teach
these
thing
;
so
that
a
lad
may
have
as
much
learning
in
a
private
as
in
a
public
education
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
,
with
submission
,
"
answer
Joseph
,
"
he
may
get
as
much
vice
:
<EOS>
witness
several
country
gentleman
,
who
be
educate
within
five
mile
of
their
own
house
,
and
be
as
wicked
as
if
they
have
know
the
world
from
their
infancy
.
<EOS>
I
remember
when
I
be
in
the
stable
,
if
a
young
horse
be
vicious
in
his
nature
,
no
correction
would
make
him
otherwise
<EOS>
:
I
take
it
to
be
equally
the
same
among
man
:
<EOS>
if
a
boy
be
of
a
mischievous
wicked
inclination
,
no
school
,
though
ever
so
private
,
will
ever
make
him
good
:
on
the
contrary
,
if
he
be
of
a
righteous
temper
,
you
may
trust
him
to
London
,
or
wherever
else
<EOS>
you
please
 
he
will
be
in
no
danger
of
be
corrupt
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
have
often
hear
my
master
say
that
the
discipline
practise
in
public
school
be
much
well
than
that
in
private
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
talk
like
a
jackanapes
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
and
so
do
your
master
.
<EOS>
discipline
indeed
!
<EOS>
because
one
man
scourge
twenty
or
thirty
boy
more
in
a
morning
than
another
,
be
he
therefore
a
well
disciplinarian
?
<EOS>
I
do
presume
to
confer
in
this
point
with
all
who
have
teach
from
Chiron
's
time
to
this
day
;
and
,
if
I
be
master
of
six
boy
only
,
I
would
preserve
as
good
discipline
amongst
them
as
the
master
of
the
great
school
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
,
young
man
;
remember
I
say
nothing
;
but
if
Sir
Thomas
himself
have
be
educate
near
home
,
and
under
the
tuition
of
somebody
 
remember
I
name
nobody
 
<EOS>
it
may
have
be
well
for
him
:
 
but
his
father
must
institute
him
in
the
knowledge
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
Nemo
mortalium
omnibus
horis
sapit
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Joseph
,
see
him
run
on
in
this
manner
,
ask
pardon
many
time
,
assure
him
he
have
no
intention
to
offend
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
have
not
,
child
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
I
be
not
angry
with
you
;
but
for
maintain
good
discipline
in
a
school
;
for
this
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
run
on
as
before
,
name
all
the
master
who
be
record
in
old
book
,
and
prefer
himself
to
them
all
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
if
this
good
man
have
an
enthusiasm
,
or
what
the
vulgar
call
a
blind
side
,
it
be
this
:
he
think
a
schoolmaster
the
great
character
in
the
world
,
and
himself
the
great
of
all
schoolmaster
:
neither
of
which
point
he
would
have
give
up
to
Alexander
the
Great
at
the
head
of
his
army
.
  
<EOS>
Adams
continue
his
subject
till
they
come
to
one
of
the
beautifull
spot
of
ground
in
the
universe
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
kind
of
natural
amphitheatre
,
form
by
the
winding
of
a
small
rivulet
,
which
be
plant
with
thick
wood
,
and
the
tree
rise
gradually
above
each
other
by
the
natural
ascent
of
the
ground
they
stand
on
;
which
ascent
as
they
hide
with
their
bough
,
they
seem
to
have
be
dispose
by
the
design
of
the
most
skilful
planter
.
<EOS>
the
soil
be
spread
with
a
verdure
which
no
paint
could
imitate
;
and
the
whole
place
may
have
raise
romantic
idea
in
eld
mind
than
those
of
Joseph
and
Fanny
,
without
the
assistance
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
here
they
arrive
about
noon
,
and
Joseph
propose
to
Adams
that
they
should
rest
awhile
in
this
delightful
place
,
and
refresh
themselves
with
some
provision
which
the
good
-
nature
of
Mrs
Wilson
have
provide
them
with
.
<EOS>
Adams
make
no
objection
to
the
proposal
;
so
down
they
sit
,
and
,
pull
out
a
cold
fowl
and
a
bottle
of
wine
,
they
make
a
repast
with
a
cheerfulness
which
may
have
attract
the
envy
of
more
splendid
table
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
omit
that
they
find
among
their
provision
a
little
paper
contain
a
piece
of
gold
,
which
Adams
imagine
have
be
put
there
by
mistake
,
would
have
return
back
to
restore
it
;
but
he
be
at
last
convince
by
Joseph
that
Mr
Wilson
have
take
this
handsome
way
of
furnish
them
with
a
supply
for
their
journey
,
on
his
have
relate
the
distress
which
they
have
be
in
,
when
they
be
relieve
by
the
generosity
of
the
pedlar
.
<EOS>
Adams
say
he
be
glad
to
see
such
an
instance
of
goodness
,
not
so
much
for
the
conveniency
which
it
bring
them
as
for
the
sake
of
the
doer
,
whose
reward
would
be
great
in
heaven
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
comfort
himself
with
a
reflection
that
he
should
shortly
have
an
opportunity
of
return
it
him
;
for
the
gentleman
be
within
a
week
to
make
a
journey
into
Somersetshire
,
to
pass
through
Adams
's
parish
,
and
have
faithfully
promise
to
call
on
him
;
a
circumstance
which
we
think
too
immaterial
to
mention
before
;
but
which
those
who
have
as
great
an
affection
for
that
gentleman
as
ourselves
will
rejoice
at
,
as
it
may
give
them
hope
of
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
then
Joseph
make
a
speech
on
charity
,
which
the
reader
,
if
he
be
so
disposed
,
may
see
in
the
next
chapter
;
for
we
scorn
to
betray
him
into
any
such
reading
,
without
first
give
him
warn
.

<EOS>
moral
reflection
by
Joseph
Andrews
;
with
the
hunting
adventure
,
and
parson
Adams
's
miraculous
escape
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
often
wonder
,
sir
,
"
say
Joseph
,
"
to
observe
so
few
instance
of
charity
among
mankind
;
for
though
the
goodness
of
a
man
's
heart
do
not
incline
him
to
relieve
the
distress
of
his
fellow
-
creature
,
methink
the
desire
of
honour
should
move
him
to
it
.
<EOS>
what
inspire
a
man
to
build
fine
house
,
to
purchase
fine
furniture
,
picture
,
clothe
,
and
other
thing
,
at
a
great
expense
,
but
an
ambition
to
be
respect
more
than
other
people
?
<EOS>
now
,
would
not
one
great
act
of
charity
,
one
instance
of
redeem
a
poor
family
from
all
the
misery
of
poverty
,
restore
an
unfortunate
tradesman
by
a
sum
of
money
to
the
mean
of
procure
a
livelihood
by
his
industry
,
discharge
an
undone
debtor
from
his
debt
or
a
gaol
,
or
any
suchlike
example
of
goodness
,
create
a
man
more
honour
and
respect
than
he
could
acquire
by
the
fine
house
,
furniture
,
picture
,
or
clothe
,
that
be
ever
behold
?
<EOS>
for
not
only
the
object
himself
who
be
thus
relieve
,
but
all
who
hear
the
name
of
such
a
person
,
must
,
I
imagine
,
reverence
him
infinitely
more
than
the
possessor
of
all
those
other
thing
;
which
when
we
so
admire
,
we
rather
praise
the
builder
,
the
workman
,
the
painter
,
the
lace
-
maker
,
the
taylor
,
and
the
rest
,
by
whose
ingenuity
they
be
produce
,
than
the
person
who
by
his
money
make
them
his
own
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
when
I
have
wait
behind
my
lady
in
a
room
hang
with
fine
picture
,
while
I
have
be
look
at
them
I
have
never
once
think
of
their
owner
,
nor
hath
any
one
else
,
as
I
ever
observe
;
for
when
it
hath
be
ask
whose
picture
that
be
,
it
be
never
once
answer
the
master
's
of
the
house
;
but
Ammyconni
,
Paul
Varnish
,
Hannibal
Scratchi
,
or
Hogarthi
,
which
I
suppose
be
the
name
of
the
painter
;
but
if
it
be
ask
 
who
redeem
such
a
one
out
of
prison
?
<EOS>
who
lend
such
a
ruin
tradesman
money
to
set
up
?
<EOS>
who
clothe
that
family
of
poor
small
child
?
<EOS>
it
be
very
plain
what
must
be
the
answer
.
<EOS>
and
besides
,
these
great
folk
be
mistaken
if
they
imagine
they
get
any
honour
at
all
by
these
mean
;
for
I
do
not
remember
I
ever
be
with
my
lady
at
any
house
where
she
commend
the
house
or
furniture
<EOS>
but
I
have
hear
her
at
her
return
home
make
sport
and
jeer
at
whatever
she
have
before
commend
;
and
I
have
be
tell
by
other
gentleman
in
livery
that
it
be
the
same
in
their
family
:
but
I
defy
the
wise
man
in
the
world
to
turn
a
true
good
action
into
ridicule
.
<EOS>
I
defy
him
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
He
who
should
endeavour
it
would
be
laugh
at
himself
,
instead
of
make
other
laugh
.
<EOS>
nobody
scarce
doth
any
good
,
yet
they
all
agree
in
praise
those
who
do
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
strange
that
all
man
should
consent
in
commend
goodness
,
and
no
man
endeavour
to
deserve
that
commendation
;
whilst
,
on
the
contrary
,
all
rail
at
wickedness
,
and
all
be
as
eager
to
be
what
they
abuse
.
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
I
know
not
the
reason
of
;
but
it
be
as
plain
as
daylight
to
those
who
converse
in
the
world
,
as
I
have
do
these
three
year
.
"
<EOS>
"
be
all
the
great
folk
wicked
then
?
"
say
Fanny
.
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
there
be
some
exception
,
"
answer
Joseph
.
<EOS>
"
some
gentleman
of
our
cloth
report
charitable
action
do
by
their
lord
and
master
;
and
I
have
hear
Squire
Pope
,
the
great
poet
,
at
my
lady
's
table
,
tell
story
of
a
man
that
live
at
a
place
call
Ross
,
and
another
at
the
Bath
,
one
<EOS>
Al
 
<EOS>
Al
 
<EOS>
I
forget
his
name
,
but
it
be
in
the
book
of
verse
.
<EOS>
this
gentleman
hath
build
up
a
stately
house
too
,
which
the
squire
like
very
well
;
but
his
charity
be
see
farther
than
his
house
,
though
it
stand
on
a
hill
,
 
ay
,
and
bring
him
more
honour
too
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
charity
that
put
him
in
the
book
,
where
the
squire
say
he
put
all
those
who
deserve
it
;
and
to
be
sure
,
as
he
live
among
all
the
great
people
,
if
there
be
any
such
,
he
would
know
them
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
all
of
Mr
Joseph
Andrews
's
speech
which
I
could
get
him
to
recollect
,
which
I
have
deliver
as
near
as
be
possible
in
his
own
word
,
with
a
very
small
embellishment
.
<EOS>
but
I
believe
the
reader
hath
not
be
a
little
surprized
at
the
long
silence
of
parson
Adams
,
especially
as
so
many
occasion
offer
themselves
to
exert
his
curiosity
and
observation
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
he
be
fast
asleep
,
and
have
so
be
from
the
beginning
of
the
precede
narrative
;
and
,
indeed
,
if
the
reader
consider
that
so
many
hour
have
pass
since
he
have
close
his
eye
,
he
will
not
wonder
at
his
repose
,
though
even
Henley
himself
,
or
as
great
an
orator
(
if
any
such
be
)
,
have
be
in
his
rostrum
or
tub
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
Joseph
,
who
whilst
he
be
speak
have
continue
in
one
attitude
,
with
his
head
recline
on
one
side
,
and
his
eye
cast
on
the
ground
,
no
sooner
perceive
,
on
look
up
,
the
position
of
Adams
,
who
be
stretch
on
his
back
,
and
snore
louder
than
the
usual
braying
of
the
animal
with
long
ear
,
than
he
turn
towards
Fanny
,
and
,
take
her
by
the
hand
,
begin
a
dalliance
,
which
,
though
consistent
with
the
pure
innocence
and
decency
,
neither
he
would
have
attempt
nor
she
permit
before
any
witness
.
<EOS>
whilst
they
amuse
themselves
in
this
harmless
and
delightful
manner
they
hear
a
pack
of
hound
approach
in
full
cry
towards
them
,
and
presently
afterwards
see
a
hare
pop
forth
from
the
wood
,
and
,
cross
the
water
,
land
within
a
few
yard
of
them
in
the
meadow
.
<EOS>
the
hare
be
no
sooner
on
shore
than
it
seat
itself
on
its
hinder
leg
,
and
listen
to
the
sound
of
the
pursuer
.
<EOS>
Fanny
be
wonderfully
pleased
with
the
little
wretch
,
and
eagerly
long
to
have
it
in
her
arm
that
she
may
preserve
it
from
the
danger
which
seem
to
threaten
it
;
but
the
rational
part
of
the
creation
do
not
always
aptly
distinguish
their
friend
from
their
foe
;
what
wonder
then
if
this
silly
creature
,
the
moment
it
behold
her
,
flee
from
the
friend
who
would
have
protect
it
,
and
,
traverse
the
meadow
again
,
pass
the
little
rivulet
on
the
opposite
side
?
<EOS>
It
be
,
however
,
so
spent
and
weak
,
that
it
fall
down
twice
or
thrice
in
its
way
.
<EOS>
this
affect
the
tender
heart
of
Fanny
,
who
exclaim
,
with
tear
in
her
eye
,
against
the
barbarity
of
worry
a
poor
innocent
defenceless
animal
out
of
its
life
,
and
put
it
to
the
extremest
torture
for
diversion
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
much
time
to
make
reflection
of
this
kind
,
for
on
a
sudden
the
hound
rush
through
the
wood
,
which
resound
with
their
throat
and
the
throat
of
their
retinue
,
who
attend
on
them
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
the
dog
now
past
the
rivulet
,
and
pursue
the
footstep
of
the
hare
;
five
horseman
attempt
to
leap
over
,
three
of
whom
succeed
,
and
two
be
in
the
attempt
throw
from
their
saddle
into
the
water
;
<EOS>
their
companion
,
and
their
own
horse
too
,
proceed
after
their
sport
,
and
leave
their
friend
and
rider
to
invoke
the
assistance
of
Fortune
,
or
employ
the
more
active
mean
of
strength
and
agility
for
their
deliverance
.
<EOS>
Joseph
,
however
,
be
not
so
unconcerned
on
this
occasion
;
he
leave
Fanny
for
a
moment
to
herself
,
and
run
to
the
gentleman
,
who
be
immediately
on
their
leg
,
shake
their
ear
,
and
easily
,
with
the
help
of
his
hand
,
obtain
the
bank
(
for
the
rivulet
be
not
at
all
deep
)
;
and
,
without
stay
to
thank
their
kind
assister
,
run
drip
across
the
meadow
,
call
to
their
brother
sportsman
to
stop
their
horse
;
but
they
hear
them
not
.
  
<EOS>
the
hound
be
now
very
little
behind
their
poor
reeling
,
stagger
prey
,
which
,
faint
almost
at
every
step
,
crawl
through
the
wood
,
and
have
almost
get
round
to
the
place
where
Fanny
stand
,
when
it
be
overtake
by
its
enemy
,
and
be
drive
out
of
the
covert
,
be
catch
,
and
instantly
tear
to
piece
before
Fanny
's
face
,
who
be
unable
to
assist
it
with
any
aid
more
powerful
than
pity
;
nor
could
she
prevail
on
Joseph
,
who
have
be
himself
a
sportsman
in
his
youth
,
to
attempt
anything
contrary
to
the
law
of
hunt
in
favour
of
the
hare
,
which
he
say
be
kill
fairly
.
  
<EOS>
the
hare
be
catch
within
a
yard
or
two
of
Adams
,
who
lie
asleep
at
some
distance
from
the
lover
;
and
the
hound
,
in
devour
it
,
and
pull
it
backwards
and
forwards
,
have
draw
it
so
close
to
him
,
that
some
of
them
(
by
mistake
perhaps
for
the
hare
's
skin
)
lay
hold
of
the
skirt
of
his
cassock
;
other
at
the
same
time
apply
their
tooth
to
his
wig
,
which
he
have
with
a
handkerchief
fasten
to
his
head
,
begin
to
pull
him
about
;
and
have
not
the
motion
of
his
body
have
more
effect
on
him
than
seem
to
be
work
by
the
noise
,
they
must
certainly
have
taste
his
flesh
,
which
delicious
flavour
may
have
be
fatal
to
him
;
but
be
rouse
by
these
tugging
,
he
instantly
awake
,
and
with
a
jerk
deliver
his
head
from
his
wig
,
he
with
most
admirable
dexterity
recover
his
leg
,
which
now
seem
the
only
member
he
could
entrust
his
safety
to
.
<EOS>
have
,
therefore
,
escape
likewise
from
at
least
a
third
part
of
his
cassock
,
which
he
willingly
leave
as
his
exuviae
or
spoil
to
the
enemy
,
he
flee
with
the
utmost
speed
he
could
summon
to
his
assistance
.
<EOS>
nor
let
this
be
any
detraction
from
the
bravery
of
his
character
:
let
the
number
of
the
enemy
,
and
the
surprize
in
which
he
be
take
,
be
consider
;
and
if
there
be
any
modern
so
outrageously
brave
that
he
can
not
admit
of
flight
in
any
circumstance
<EOS>
whatever
,
I
say
(
<EOS>
but
I
whisper
that
softly
,
and
I
solemnly
declare
without
any
intention
of
give
offence
to
any
brave
man
in
the
nation
)
,
I
say
,
or
rather
I
whisper
,
that
he
be
an
ignorant
fellow
,
and
hath
never
read
Homer
nor
Virgil
,
nor
know
he
anything
of
Hector
or
Turnus
;
<EOS>
nay
,
he
be
unacquainted
with
the
history
of
some
great
man
live
,
who
,
though
as
brave
as
lion
,
ay
,
as
tiger
,
have
run
away
,
the
Lord
know
how
far
,
and
the
Lord
know
why
,
to
the
surprize
of
their
friend
and
the
entertainment
of
their
enemy
.
<EOS>
but
if
person
of
such
heroic
disposition
be
a
little
offend
at
the
behaviour
of
Adams
,
we
assure
them
they
shall
be
as
much
pleased
with
what
we
shall
immediately
relate
of
Joseph
Andrews
.
<EOS>
the
master
of
the
pack
be
just
arrive
,
or
,
as
the
sportsman
call
it
,
come
in
,
when
Adams
set
out
,
as
we
have
before
mention
.
<EOS>
this
gentleman
be
generally
say
to
be
a
great
lover
of
humour
;
but
,
not
to
mince
the
matter
,
especially
as
we
be
upon
this
subject
,
he
be
a
great
hunter
of
man
;
indeed
,
he
have
hitherto
follow
the
sport
only
with
dog
of
his
own
specie
;
for
he
keep
two
or
three
couple
of
barking
cur
for
that
use
only
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
he
think
he
have
now
find
a
man
nimble
enough
,
he
be
willing
to
indulge
himself
with
other
sport
,
and
accordingly
,
cry
out
,
"
steal
away
,
"
encourage
the
hound
to
pursue
Mr
Adams
,
swear
it
<EOS>
be
the
large
jack
-
hare
he
ever
see
;
at
the
same
time
halloo
and
hoop
as
if
a
conquered
foe
be
fly
before
him
;
in
which
he
be
imitate
by
these
two
or
three
couple
of
human
or
rather
two
-
legged
cur
on
horseback
which
we
have
mention
before
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
thou
,
whoever
thou
art
,
whether
a
muse
,
or
by
what
other
name
soever
thou
choosest
to
be
call
,
who
presidest
over
biography
,
and
hast
inspire
all
the
writer
of
life
in
these
our
time
:
<EOS>
thou
who
didst
infuse
such
wonderful
humour
into
the
pen
of
immortal
Gulliver
;
who
hast
carefully
guide
the
judgment
whilst
thou
hast
exalt
the
nervous
manly
style
of
thy
Mallet
:
thou
who
hadst
no
hand
in
that
dedication
and
preface
,
or
the
translation
,
which
thou
wouldst
willingly
have
strike
out
of
the
life
of
Cicero
:
lastly
,
thou
who
,
without
the
assistance
of
the
least
spice
of
literature
,
and
even
against
his
inclination
,
hast
,
in
some
page
of
his
book
,
force
Colley
Cibber
to
write
English
;
do
thou
assist
me
in
what
I
find
myself
unequal
to
.
<EOS>
do
thou
introduce
on
the
plain
the
young
,
the
gay
,
the
brave
Joseph
Andrews
,
whilst
man
shall
view
him
with
admiration
and
envy
,
tender
virgin
with
love
and
anxious
concern
for
his
safety
.
  
<EOS>
no
sooner
do
Joseph
Andrews
perceive
the
distress
of
his
friend
,
when
first
the
quick
-
scent
dog
attack
him
,
than
he
grasp
his
cudgel
in
his
right
hand
 
a
cudgel
which
his
father
have
of
his
grandfather
,
to
whom
a
mighty
strong
man
of
Kent
have
give
it
for
a
present
in
that
day
when
he
break
three
head
on
the
stage
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
cudgel
of
mighty
strength
and
wonderful
art
,
make
by
one
of
Mr
Deard
's
good
workman
,
whom
no
other
artificer
can
equal
,
and
who
hath
make
all
those
stick
which
the
beau
have
lately
walk
with
about
the
Park
in
a
morning
;
but
this
be
far
his
masterpiece
.
<EOS>
on
its
head
be
engrave
a
nose
and
chin
,
which
may
have
be
mistake
for
a
pair
of
nutcracker
.
<EOS>
the
learn
have
imagine
it
design
to
represent
the
Gorgon
;
but
it
be
in
fact
copy
from
the
face
of
a
certain
long
english
baronet
,
of
infinite
wit
,
humour
,
and
gravity
.
<EOS>
He
do
intend
to
have
engrave
here
many
history
:
as
the
first
night
of
Captain
B
#
#
#
#
's
play
,
where
you
would
have
see
critic
in
embroidery
transplant
from
the
box
to
the
pit
,
whose
ancient
inhabitant
be
exalt
to
the
gallery
,
where
they
play
on
catcall
.
<EOS>
He
do
intend
to
have
paint
an
auction
room
,
where
Mr
Cock
would
have
appear
aloft
in
his
pulpit
,
trumpet
forth
the
praise
of
a
china
basin
,
and
with
astonishment
wonder
that
"
nobody
bid
more
for
that
fine
,
that
superb
<EOS>
"
He
do
intend
to
have
engrave
many
other
thing
,
but
be
force
to
leave
all
out
for
want
of
room
.
  
<EOS>
no
sooner
have
Joseph
grasp
his
cudgel
in
his
hand
than
lightning
dart
from
his
eye
;
and
the
heroick
youth
,
swift
of
foot
,
run
with
the
utmost
speed
to
his
friend
's
assistance
.
<EOS>
He
overtake
him
just
as
Rockwood
have
lay
hold
of
the
skirt
of
his
cassock
,
which
,
be
tear
,
hang
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
reader
,
we
would
make
a
simile
on
this
occasion
,
but
for
two
reason
:
the
first
be
,
it
would
interrupt
the
description
,
which
should
be
rapid
in
this
part
;
but
that
doth
not
weigh
much
,
many
precedent
occur
for
such
an
interruption
:
the
second
and
much
the
great
reason
be
,
that
we
could
find
no
simile
adequate
to
our
purpose
:
for
indeed
,
what
instance
could
we
bring
to
set
before
our
reader
's
eye
at
once
the
idea
of
friendship
,
courage
,
youth
,
beauty
,
strength
,
and
swiftness
?
<EOS>
all
which
blaze
in
the
person
of
Joseph
Andrews
.
<EOS>
let
those
,
therefore
,
that
describe
lion
and
tiger
,
and
hero
fiercer
than
both
,
raise
their
poem
or
play
with
the
simile
of
Joseph
Andrews
,
who
be
himself
above
the
reach
of
any
simile
.
  
<EOS>
now
Rockwood
have
lay
fast
hold
on
the
parson
's
skirt
,
and
stopt
his
flight
;
which
Joseph
no
sooner
perceive
than
he
level
his
cudgel
at
his
head
and
lay
him
sprawl
.
<EOS>
Jowler
and
Ringwood
then
fall
on
his
greatcoat
,
and
have
undoubtedly
bring
him
to
the
ground
,
have
not
Joseph
,
collect
all
his
force
,
give
Jowler
such
a
rap
on
the
back
,
<EOS>
that
,
quit
his
hold
,
he
run
howl
over
the
plain
.
<EOS>
a
hard
fate
remain
for
thee
,
o
Ringwood
!
<EOS>
Ringwood
the
good
hound
that
ever
pursue
a
hare
,
who
never
throw
his
tongue
but
where
the
scent
be
undoubtedly
true
;
good
at
trailing
,
and
sure
in
a
highway
;
no
babler
,
no
overrunner
;
respect
by
the
whole
pack
,
who
,
whenever
he
open
,
know
the
game
be
at
hand
.
<EOS>
He
fall
by
the
stroke
of
Joseph
.
<EOS>
Thunder
and
Plunder
,
and
Wonder
and
Blunder
,
be
the
next
victim
of
his
wrath
,
and
measure
their
length
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
then
Fairmaid
,
a
bitch
which
Mr
John
Temple
have
breed
up
in
his
house
,
and
feed
at
his
own
table
,
and
lately
send
the
squire
fifty
mile
for
a
present
,
run
fiercely
at
Joseph
and
bite
him
by
the
leg
:
no
dog
be
ever
fiercer
than
she
,
be
descend
from
an
amazonian
breed
,
and
have
worry
bull
in
her
own
country
,
but
now
wage
an
unequal
fight
,
and
have
share
the
fate
of
those
we
have
mention
before
,
have
not
Diana
(
the
reader
may
believe
it
or
not
if
he
please
)
in
that
instant
interpose
,
and
,
in
the
shape
of
the
huntsman
,
snatch
her
favourite
up
in
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
the
parson
now
face
about
,
and
with
his
crabstick
fell
many
to
the
earth
,
and
scatter
other
,
till
he
be
attack
by
Caesar
and
pull
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
then
Joseph
fly
to
his
rescue
,
and
with
such
may
fell
on
the
victor
,
that
,
o
eternal
blot
to
his
name
!
<EOS>
Caesar
run
yelp
away
.
  
<EOS>
the
battle
now
rage
with
the
most
dreadful
violence
,
when
,
lo
!
<EOS>
the
huntsman
,
a
man
of
year
and
dignity
,
lift
his
voice
,
and
call
his
hound
from
the
fight
,
tell
them
,
in
a
language
they
understand
,
that
it
be
in
vain
to
contend
longer
,
for
that
fate
have
decree
the
victory
to
their
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
thus
far
the
muse
hath
with
her
usual
dignity
relate
this
prodigious
battle
,
a
battle
we
apprehend
never
equal
by
any
poet
,
romance
or
life
writer
whatever
,
and
,
have
bring
it
to
a
conclusion
,
she
cease
;
we
shall
therefore
proceed
in
our
ordinary
style
with
the
continuation
of
this
history
.
<EOS>
the
squire
and
his
companion
,
whom
the
figure
of
Adams
and
the
gallantry
of
Joseph
have
at
first
throw
into
a
violent
fit
of
laughter
,
and
who
have
hitherto
beheld
the
engagement
with
more
delight
than
any
chase
,
shooting
-
match
,
race
,
cock
-
fighting
,
bull
or
bear
baiting
,
have
ever
give
them
,
begin
now
to
apprehend
the
danger
of
their
hound
,
many
of
which
lie
sprawl
in
the
field
.
<EOS>
the
squire
,
therefore
,
have
first
call
his
friend
about
him
,
as
guard
for
safety
of
his
person
,
ride
manfully
up
to
the
combatant
,
and
,
summon
all
the
terror
he
be
master
of
into
his
countenance
,
<EOS>
demand
with
an
authoritative
voice
of
Joseph
what
he
mean
by
assault
his
dog
in
that
manner
?
<EOS>
Joseph
answer
,
with
great
intrepidity
,
that
they
have
first
fall
on
his
friend
;
and
if
they
have
belong
to
the
great
man
in
the
kingdom
,
he
would
have
treat
them
in
the
same
way
;
for
,
whilst
his
vein
contain
a
single
drop
of
blood
,
he
would
not
stand
idle
by
and
see
that
gentleman
(
point
to
Adams
)
abuse
either
by
man
or
beast
;
and
,
have
so
say
,
both
he
and
Adams
brandish
their
wooden
weapon
,
and
put
themselves
into
such
a
posture
,
that
the
squire
and
his
company
think
proper
to
preponderate
before
they
offer
to
revenge
the
cause
of
their
four
-
footed
ally
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
instant
Fanny
,
whom
the
apprehension
of
Joseph
's
danger
have
alarm
so
much
that
,
forget
her
own
,
she
have
make
the
utmost
expedition
,
come
up
.
<EOS>
the
squire
and
all
the
horseman
be
so
surprized
with
her
beauty
,
that
they
immediately
fix
both
their
eye
and
thought
solely
on
her
,
every
one
declare
he
have
never
see
so
charm
a
creature
.
<EOS>
neither
mirth
nor
anger
engage
them
a
moment
longer
,
but
all
sit
in
silent
amaze
.
<EOS>
the
huntsman
only
be
free
from
her
attraction
,
who
be
busy
in
cut
the
ear
of
the
dog
,
and
endeavour
to
recover
them
to
life
;
in
which
he
succeed
so
well
,
that
only
two
of
no
great
note
remain
slaughter
on
the
field
of
action
.
<EOS>
upon
this
the
huntsman
declare
,
"
'
Twas
<EOS>
well
it
be
no
bad
;
for
his
part
he
could
not
blame
the
gentleman
,
and
wonder
his
master
would
encourage
the
dog
to
hunt
Christians
;
that
it
be
the
sure
way
to
spoil
them
,
to
make
them
follow
vermin
instead
of
stick
to
a
hare
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
squire
,
be
inform
of
the
little
mischief
that
have
be
do
,
and
perhaps
have
more
mischief
of
another
kind
in
his
head
,
accost
Mr
Adams
with
a
more
favourable
aspect
than
before
:
he
tell
him
he
be
sorry
for
what
have
happen
;
that
he
have
endeavour
all
he
could
to
prevent
it
the
moment
he
be
acquaint
with
his
cloth
,
and
greatly
commend
the
courage
of
his
servant
,
for
so
he
imagine
Joseph
to
be
.
<EOS>
He
then
invite
Mr
Adams
to
dinner
,
and
desire
the
young
woman
may
come
with
him
.
<EOS>
Adams
refuse
a
long
while
;
but
the
invitation
be
repeat
with
so
much
earnestness
and
courtesy
,
that
at
length
he
be
force
to
accept
it
.
<EOS>
His
wig
and
hat
,
and
other
spoil
of
the
field
,
be
gather
together
by
Joseph
(
for
otherwise
probably
they
would
have
be
forget
)
,
he
put
himself
into
the
good
order
he
could
;
and
then
the
horse
and
foot
move
forward
in
the
same
pace
towards
the
squire
's
house
,
which
stand
at
a
very
little
distance
.
  
<EOS>
whilst
they
be
on
the
road
the
lovely
Fanny
attract
the
eye
of
all
:
they
endeavour
to
outvie
one
another
in
encomium
on
her
beauty
;
which
the
reader
will
pardon
my
not
relate
,
as
they
have
not
anything
new
or
uncommon
in
them
:
<EOS>
so
must
he
likewise
my
not
set
down
the
many
curious
jest
which
be
make
on
Adams
;
some
of
them
declare
that
parson
-
hunting
be
the
good
sport
in
the
world
;
other
commend
his
standing
at
bay
,
which
they
say
he
have
do
as
well
as
any
badger
;
with
such
like
merriment
,
which
,
though
it
would
ill
become
the
dignity
of
this
history
,
afford
much
laughter
and
diversion
to
the
squire
and
his
facetious
companion
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
a
scene
of
roasting
,
very
nicely
adapt
to
the
present
taste
and
time
.
  
<EOS>
They
arrive
at
the
squire
's
house
just
as
his
dinner
be
ready
.
<EOS>
a
little
dispute
arise
on
the
account
of
Fanny
,
whom
the
squire
,
who
be
a
bachelor
,
be
desirous
to
place
at
his
own
table
;
but
she
would
not
consent
,
nor
would
Mr
Adams
permit
her
to
be
part
from
Joseph
;
so
that
she
be
at
length
with
him
consign
over
to
the
kitchen
,
where
the
servant
be
order
to
make
him
drunk
;
a
favour
which
be
likewise
intend
for
Adams
;
which
design
be
execute
<EOS>
,
the
squire
think
he
should
easily
accomplish
what
he
have
when
he
first
see
her
intend
to
perpetrate
with
Fanny
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
not
be
improper
,
before
we
proceed
farther
,
to
open
a
little
the
character
of
this
gentleman
,
and
that
of
his
friend
.
<EOS>
the
master
of
this
house
,
then
,
be
a
man
of
a
very
considerable
fortune
;
a
bachelor
,
as
we
have
say
,
and
about
forty
year
of
age
:
he
have
be
educate
(
if
we
may
use
the
expression
)
in
the
country
,
and
at
his
own
home
,
under
the
care
of
his
mother
,
and
a
tutor
who
have
order
never
to
correct
him
,
nor
to
compel
him
to
learn
more
than
he
like
,
which
it
seem
be
very
little
,
and
that
only
in
his
childhood
;
for
from
the
age
of
fifteen
he
addict
himself
entirely
to
hunting
and
other
rural
amusement
,
for
which
his
mother
take
care
to
equip
him
with
horse
,
hound
,
and
all
other
necessary
;
and
his
tutor
,
endeavour
to
ingratiate
himself
with
his
young
pupil
,
who
would
,
he
know
,
be
able
handsomely
to
provide
for
him
,
become
his
companion
,
not
only
at
these
exercise
,
but
likewise
over
a
bottle
,
which
the
young
squire
have
a
very
early
relish
for
.
<EOS>
at
the
age
of
twenty
his
mother
begin
to
think
she
have
not
fulfil
the
duty
of
a
parent
;
she
therefore
resolve
to
persuade
her
son
,
if
possible
,
to
that
<EOS>
which
she
imagine
would
well
supply
all
that
he
may
have
learn
at
a
public
school
or
university
 
<EOS>
this
be
what
they
commonly
call
travelling
;
which
,
with
the
help
of
the
tutor
,
who
be
fix
on
to
attend
him
,
she
easily
succeed
in
.
<EOS>
He
make
in
three
year
the
tour
of
Europe
,
as
they
term
it
,
and
return
home
well
furnish
with
french
clothe
,
phrase
,
and
servant
,
with
a
hearty
contempt
for
his
own
country
;
especially
what
have
any
savour
of
the
plain
spirit
and
honesty
of
our
ancestor
.
<EOS>
His
mother
greatly
applaud
herself
at
his
return
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
be
master
of
his
own
fortune
,
he
soon
procure
himself
a
seat
in
Parliament
,
and
be
in
the
common
opinion
one
of
the
fine
gentleman
of
his
age
:
but
what
distinguish
him
chiefly
be
a
strange
delight
which
he
take
in
everything
which
be
ridiculous
,
odious
,
and
absurd
in
his
own
specie
;
so
that
he
never
choose
a
companion
without
one
or
more
of
these
ingredient
,
and
those
who
be
mark
by
nature
in
the
most
eminent
degree
with
them
be
most
his
favourite
.
<EOS>
if
he
ever
find
a
man
who
either
have
not
,
or
endeavour
to
conceal
,
these
imperfection
,
he
take
great
pleasure
in
invent
method
of
force
him
into
absurdity
which
be
not
natural
to
him
,
or
in
draw
forth
and
expose
those
that
be
;
for
which
purpose
he
be
always
provide
with
a
set
of
fellow
,
whom
we
have
before
call
cur
,
and
who
do
,
indeed
,
no
great
honour
to
the
canine
kind
;
their
business
be
to
hunt
out
and
display
everything
that
have
any
savour
of
the
above
-
mention
quality
,
and
especially
in
the
grave
and
good
character
;
but
if
they
fail
in
their
search
,
they
be
to
turn
even
virtue
and
wisdom
themselves
into
ridicule
,
for
the
diversion
of
their
master
and
feeder
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
of
curlike
disposition
who
be
now
at
his
house
,
and
whom
he
have
bring
with
him
from
London
,
be
,
an
old
half
-
pay
officer
,
a
player
,
a

as
soon
as
dinner
be

,
while
Mr
Adams
be
say
grace
,
the
captain
convey
his
chair
from
behind
him
;
so
that
when
he
endeavour
to
seat
himself
he
fall
down
on
the
ground
,
and
this
complete
joke
the
first
,
to
the
great
entertainment
of
the
whole
company

<EOS>
the
second
joke
be
perform
by
the
poet
,
who
sit
next
him
on
the
other
side
,
and
take
an
opportunity
,
while
poor
Adams
be
respectfully
drink
to
the
master
of
the
house
,
to
overturn
a
plate
of

into
his

;
which
,
with
the
many
apology
he
make
,
and
the

gentle
answer

cause
much
mirth
in

the

a
quantity
of

into
Mr
Adams
's
ale
,
which
he
declare
to
be
the
good
liquor
he
ever
drink
,
but
rather
too
rich
of
the
malt
,
contribute
again
to
their
laughter
.
<EOS>
Mr
Adams
,
from
whom
we
have
most
of
this
relation
,
could
not
recollect
all
the
jest
of
this
kind
practise
on
him
,
which
the
inoffensive
disposition
of
his
own
heart
make
him
slow
in
discover
;
and
indeed
,
have
it
not
be
for
the
information
which
we
receive
from
a
servant
of
the
family
,
this
part
of
our
history
,
which
we
take
to
be
none
of
the
least
curious
,
must
have
be
deplorably
imperfect
;
though
we
must
own
it
probable
that
some
more
joke
be
(
as
they
call
it
)
<EOS>
crack
during
their
dinner
;
but
we
have
by
no
means
be
able
to
come
at
the
knowledge
of
them
.
<EOS>
when
dinner
be
remove
,
the

begin
to
repeat
some
verse
,
which
,
he
say
,
be
make
extempore
.
<EOS>
the
follow
be
a
copy
of
them
,
procure
with
the
great
difficulty
:
    
an
extempore
Poem
on
parson
Adams
.
      
<EOS>
do
ever
mortal
such
a

view
?
    
<EOS>
His
cassock
old
,
his
wig
<EOS>
not
over

well
may
the
hound
have
him
for
fox
mistaken
,
    
<EOS>
in
smell
more
like
to
that
than
rusty
bacon[A

;
    
but
would
it
not
make
any
mortal
stare
    
<EOS>
to
see
this
parson
take
for
a
hare
?
    
<EOS>
Could
Phoebus
err
thus
grossly
,
even
he
    
for
a
good
player
may
have
take
thee
.
  
<EOS>
[

all
hound

will
hunt

piece
of
    
rusty

<EOS>
at
which
word
the
bard
whipt
off
the
player
's
wig
,
and
receive
the
approbation
of
the
company
,
rather
perhaps
for
the
dexterity
of
his
hand
than
his
head
.
<EOS>
the
player
,
instead
of
retort
the
jest
on
the
poet
,
begin
to
display
his
talent
on
the
same
subject
.
<EOS>
He
repeat
many
scrap
of
wit
out
of
play
,
reflect
on
the
whole
body
of
the
clergy
,
which
be
receive
with
great
acclamation
by
all
present
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
the
dancing
-
master
's
turn
to
exhibit
his
talent
;
he
therefore
,
address
himself
to
Adams
in
broken
English
,
tell
him
,
"
He
be
<EOS>
a
man
ver
well
make
for
de
dance
,
and
he
suppose
by
his
walk
dat
<EOS>
he
have
learn
of
some
great
master
.
"
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
It
be
ver
pretty
quality
in
clergyman
to
dance
;
"
and
conclude
with
desire
him
to
dance
a
minuet
,
tell
him
,
"
his
cassock
would
serve
for
petticoat
;
and
that
he
would
himself
be
his
partner
.
"
<EOS>
at
which
word
,
without
wait
for
an
answer
,
he
pull
out
his
glove
,
and
the
fiddler
be
prepare
his
fiddle
.
<EOS>
the
company
all
offer
the
dancing
-
master
wager
that
the
parson
out
-
dance
him
,
which
he
refuse
,
say
"
he
believe
so
too
,
for
he
have
never
see
any
man
in
his
life
who
look
de
dance
so
well
as
de
gentleman
:
"
he
then
step
forwards
to
take
Adams
by
the
hand
,
which
the
latter
hastily
withdraw
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
clench
his
fist
,
advise
him
not
to
carry
the
jest
too
far
,
for
he
would
not
endure
be
put
upon
.
<EOS>
the
dancing
-
master
no
sooner
see
the
fist
than
he
prudently
retire
out
of
its
reach
,
and
stand
aloof
,
mimicking
Adams
,
whose
eye
be
fix
on
him
,
not
guess
what
he
be
at
,
but
to
avoid
his
lay
hold
on
him
,
which
he
have
once
attempt
.
<EOS>
in
the
meanwhile
,
the
captain
,
perceive
an
opportunity
,
pin
a
cracker
or
devil
to
the
cassock
,
and
then
light
it
with
their
little
smoking
-
candle
.
<EOS>
Adams
,
be
a
stranger
to
this
sport
,
and
believe
he
have
be
blow
up
in
reality
,
start
from
his
chair
,
and
jump
about
the
room
,
to
the
infinite
joy
of
the
beholder
,
who
declare
he
be
the
good
dancer
in
the
universe
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
devil
have
do
torment
him
,
and
he
have
a
little
recover
his
confusion
<EOS>
,
he
return
to
the
table
,
stand
up
in
the
posture
of
one
who
intend
to
make
a
speech
.
<EOS>
They
all
cry
out
,
"
hear
him
,
hear
him
;
"
and
he
then
speak
in
the
follow
manner
:
"
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
be
sorry
to
see
one
to
whom
Providence
hath
be
so
bountiful
in
bestow
his
favour
make
so
ill
and
ungrateful
a
return
for
them
;
for
,
though
you
have
not
insult
me
yourself
,
it
be
visible
you
have
delight
in
those
that
do
it
,
nor
have
once
discourage
the
many
rudeness
which
have
be
show
towards
me
;
indeed
,
towards
yourself
,
if
you
rightly
understand
them
;
for
I
be
your
guest
,
and
by
the
law
of
hospitality
entitle
to
your
protection
.
<EOS>
one
gentleman
have
think
proper
to
produce
some
poetry
upon
me
,
of
which
I
shall
only
say
,
that
I
have
rather
be
the
subject
than
the
composer
.
<EOS>
He
hath
please
to
treat
me
with
disrespect
as
a
parson
.
<EOS>
I
apprehend
my
order
be
not
the
subject
of
scorn
,
nor
that
I
can
become
so
,
unless
by
be
a
disgrace
to
it
,
which
I
hope
poverty
will
never
be
call
.
<EOS>
another
gentleman
,
indeed
,
hath
repeat
some
sentence
,
where
the
order
itself
be
mention
with
contempt
.
<EOS>
He
say
they
be
take
from
play
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
such
play
be
a
scandal
to
the
government
which
permit
them
,
and
cursed
will
be
the
nation
where
they
be
represent
.
<EOS>
how
other
have
treat
me
I
need
not
observe
;
they
themselves
,
when
they
reflect
,
must
allow
the
behaviour
to
be
as
improper
to
my
year
as
to
my
cloth
.
<EOS>
You
find
me
,
sir
,
travel
with
two
of
my
parishioner
(
I
omit
your
hound
fall
on
me
;
for
I
have
quite
forgive
it
,
whether
it
proceed
from
the
wantonness
or
negligence
of
the
huntsman
)
:
my
appearance
may
very
well
persuade
you
that
your
invitation
be
an
act
of
charity
,
though
in
reality
we
be
well
provide
;
yes
,
sir
,
if
we
have
have
an
hundred
mile
to
travel
,
we
have
sufficient
to
bear
our
expense
in
a
noble
manner
.
"
<EOS>
(
at
which
word
he
produce
the
half
-
guinea
which
be
find
in
the
basket
.
)
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
show
you
this
out
of
ostentation
of
rich
,
but
to
convince
you
I
speak
truth
.
<EOS>
Your
seat
me
at
your
table
be
an
honour
which
I
do
not
ambitiously
affect
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
here
,
I
endeavour
to
behave
towards
you
with
the
utmost
respect
;
if
I
have
fail
,
it
be
not
with
design
;
nor
could
I
,
certainly
,
so
far
be
guilty
as
to
deserve
the
insult
I
have
suffer
.
<EOS>
if
they
be
mean
,
therefore
,
either
to
my
order
or
my
poverty
<EOS>
(
and
you
see
I
be
not
very
poor
)
,
the
shame
doth
not
lie
at
my
door
,
and
I
heartily
pray
that
the
sin
may
be
avert
from
yours
.
"
<EOS>
He
thus
finish
,
and
receive
a
general
clap
from
the
whole
company
.
<EOS>
then
the
gentleman
of
the
house
tell
him
,
"
He
be
sorry
for
what
have
happen
;
that
he
could
not
accuse
him
of
any
share
in
it
;
that
the
verse
be
,
as
himself
have
well
observe
,
so
bad
,
that
he
may
easily
answer
them
;
and
for
the
serpent
,
it
be
undoubtedly
a
very
great
affront
do
him
by
the
dancing
-
master
,
for
which
,
if
he
well
thrash
him
,
as
he
deserve
,
he
should
be
very
much
pleased
to
see
it
"
(
in
which
,
probably
,
he
speak
truth
)
.
<EOS>
Adams
answer
,
"
whoever
have
do
it
,
it
be
not
his
profession
to
punish
him
that
way
;
but
for
the
person
whom
he
have
accuse
,
I
be
a
witness
,
"
say
he
,
"
of
his
innocence
;
for
I
have
my
eye
on
him
all
the
while
.
<EOS>
whoever
he
be
,
God
forgive
him
,
and
bestow
on
him
a
little
more
sense
as
well
as
humanity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
captain
answer
with
a
surly
look
and
accent
,
"
that
he
hope
he
do
not
mean
to
reflect
upon
him
;
d####n
him
,
he
have
as
much
imanity
as
another
,
and
,
if
any
man
say
he
have
not
,
he
would
convince
him
of
his
mistake
by
cut
his
throat
.
"
<EOS>
Adams
,
smile
,
say
,
"
He
believe
he
have
speak
right
by
accident
.
"
<EOS>
to
which
the
captain
return
,
"
what
do
you
mean
by
my
speak
right
?
<EOS>
if
you
be
not
a
parson
,
I
would
not
take
these
word
;
but
your
gown
protect
you
.
<EOS>
if
any
man
who
wear
a
sword
have
say
so
much
,
I
have
pull
him
by
the
nose
before
this
.
"
<EOS>
Adams
reply
,
"
if
he
attempt
any
rudeness
to
his
person
,
he
would
not
find
any
protection
for
himself
in
his
gown
;
"
and
,
clench
his
fist
,
declare
"
he
have
thrash
many
a
stouter
man
.
"
<EOS>
the
gentleman
do
all
he
could
to
encourage
this
warlike
disposition
in
Adams
,
and
be
in
hope
to
have
produce
a
battle
,
but
he
be
disappoint
;
for
the
captain
make
no
other
answer
than
<EOS>
,
"
It
be
very
well
<EOS>
you
be
a
parson
;
"
and
so
,
drink
off
a
bumper
to
old
mother
Church
,
end
the
dispute
.
  
<EOS>
then
the
doctor
,
who
have
hitherto
be
silent
,
and
who
be
the
grave
but
most
mischievous
dog
of
all
,
in
a
very
pompous
speech
highly
applaud
what
Adams
have
say
,
and
as
much
discommende
the
behaviour
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
proceed
to
encomium
on
the
Church
and
poverty
;
and
,
lastly
,
recommend
forgiveness
of
what
have
pass
to
Adams
,
who
immediately
answer
,
"
that
everything
be
forgive
;
"
and
in
the
warmth
of
his
goodness
he
fill
a
bumper
of
strong
beer
(
a
liquor
he
prefer
to
wine
)
,
and
drank
a
health
to
the
whole
company
,
shake
the
captain
and
the
poet
heartily
by
the
hand
,
and
address
himself
with
great
respect
to
the
doctor
;
who
,
indeed
,
have
not
laugh
outwardly
at
anything
that
past
,
as
he
have
a
perfect
command
of
his
muscle
,
and
could
laugh
inwardly
without
betray
the
least
symptom
in
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
now
begin
a
second
formal
speech
,
in
which
he
declaim
against
all
levity
of
conversation
,
and
what
be
usually
call
mirth
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
there
be
amusement
fit
for
person
of
all
age
and
degree
,
from
the
rattle
to
the
discuss
a
point
of
philosophy
;
and
that
man
discover
themselves
in
nothing
more
than
in
the
choice
of
their
amusement
;
for
,
"
say
he
,
"
as
it
must
greatly
raise
our
expectation
of
the
future
conduct
in
life
of
boy
whom
in
their
tender
year
we
perceive
,
instead
of
taw
or
ball
,
or
other
childish
plaything
,
to
chuse
,
at
their
leisure
hour
,
to
exercise
their
genius
in
contention
of
wit
,
learning
,
and
such
like
;
so
must
it
inspire
one
with
equal
contempt
of
a
man
,
if
we
should
discover
him
play
at
taw
or
other
childish
play
.
"
<EOS>
Adams
highly
commend
the
doctor
's
opinion
,
and
say
,
"
He
have
often
wonder
at
some
passage
in
ancient
author
,
where
Scipio
,
Laelius
,
and
other
great
man
be
represent
to
have
pass
many
hour
in
amusement
of
the
most
trifling
kind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
doctor
reply
,
"
He
have
by
him
an
old
greek
manuscript
where
a
favourite
diversion
of
Socrates
be
record
.
"
<EOS>
"
ay
!
"
say
the
parson
eagerly
;
"
I
should
be
most
infinitely
oblige
to
you
for
the
favour
of
peruse
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
doctor
promise
to
send
it
him
,
and
farther
say
,
"
that
he
believe
he
could
describe
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
"
say
he
,
"
as
near
as
I
can
remember
<EOS>
,
it
be
this
:
there
be
a
throne
erect
,
on
one
side
of
which
sit
a
king
and
on
the
other
a
queen
,
with
their
guard
and
attendant
range
on
both
side
;
to
them
be
introduce
an
ambassador
,
which
part
Socrates
always
use
to
perform
himself
;
and
when
he
be
lead
up
to
the
footstep
of
the
throne
he
address
himself
to
the
monarchs
in
some
grave
speech
,
full
of
virtue
,
and
goodness
,
and
morality
,
and
such
like
.
<EOS>
after
which
,
he
be
seat
between
the
king
and
queen
,
and
royally
entertain
.
<EOS>
this
I
think
be
the
chief
part
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
may
have
forget
some
particular
;
for
it
be
long
since
I
read
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Adams
say
,
"
It
be
,
indeed
,
a
diversion
worthy
the
relaxation
of
so
great
a
man
;
and
think
something
resemble
it
should
be
institute
among
our
great
man
,
instead
of
card
and
other
idle
pastime
,
in
which
,
he
be
inform
,
they
trifle
away
too
much
of
their
life
.
"
<EOS>
He
add
,
"
the
christian
religion
be
a
noble
subject
for
these
speech
than
any
Socrates
could
have
invent
.
"
<EOS>
the
gentleman
of
the
house
approve
what
Mr
Adams
say
,
and
declare
"
he
be
resolve
to
perform
the
ceremony
this
very
evening
.
"
<EOS>
to
which
the
doctor
object
,
as
no
one
be
prepare
with
a
speech
,
"
unless
,
"
say
he
(
turn
to
Adams
with
a
gravity
of
countenance
which
would
have
deceive
a
more
know
man
)
,
"
you
have
a
sermon
about
you
,
doctor
.
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
I
never
travel
without
one
,
for
fear
of
what
may
happen
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
easily
prevail
on
by
his
worthy
friend
,
as
he
now
call
the
doctor
,
to
undertake
the
part
of
the
ambassador
;
so
that
the
gentleman
send
immediate
order
to
have
the
throne
erect
,
which
be
perform
before
they
have
drink
two
bottle
;
and
,
perhaps
,
the
reader
will
hereafter
have
no
great
reason
to
admire
the
nimbleness
of
the
servant
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
to
confess
the
truth
,
the
throne
be
no
more
than
this
:
there
be
a
great
tub
of
water
provide
,
on
each
side
of
which
be
place
two
stool
raise
high
than
the
surface
of
the
tub
,
and
over
the
whole
be
lay
a
blanket
;
on
these
stool
be
place
the
king
and
queen
,
namely
,
the
master
of
the
house
and
the
captain
.
<EOS>
and
now
the
ambassador
be
introduce
between
the
poet
and
the
doctor
;
who
,
have
read
his
sermon
,
to
the
great
entertainment
of
all
present
,
be
lead
up
to
his
place
and
seat
between
their
majesty
.
<EOS>
They
immediately
rise
up
,
when
the
blanket
,
want
its
support
at
either
end
,
give
way
,
and
souse
Adams
over
head
and
ear
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
the
captain
make
his
escape
,
but
,
unluckily
,
the
gentleman
himself
not
be
as
nimble
as
he
ought
,
Adams
catch
hold
of
him
before
he
descend
from
his
throne
,
and
pull
him
in
with
him
,
to
the
entire
secret
satisfaction
of
all
the
company
.
<EOS>
Adams
,
after
duck
the
squire
twice
or
thrice
,
leapt
out
of
the
tub
,
and
look
sharp
for
the
doctor
,
whom
he
would
certainly
have
convey
to
the
same
place
of
honour
;
but
he
have
wisely
withdraw
:
he
then
search
for
his
crabstick
,
and
have
find
that
,
as
well
as
his
fellow
traveller
,
he
declare
he
would
not
stay
a
moment
longer
in
such
a
house
.
<EOS>
He
then
depart
,
without
take
leave
of
his
host
,
whom
he
have
exact
a
more
severe
revenge
on
than
he
intend
;
for
,
as
he
do
not
use
sufficient
care
to
dry
himself
in
time
,
he
catch
a
cold
by
the
accident
which
throw
him
into
a
fever
that
have
like
to
have
cost
him
his
life
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
which
some
reader
will
think
too
short
and
other
too
long
.
  
<EOS>
Adams
,
and
Joseph
,
who
be
no
less
enraged
than
his
friend
at
the
treatment
he
meet
with
,
go
out
with
their
stick
in
their
hand
,
and
carry
off
Fanny
,
notwithstanding
the
opposition
of
the
servant
,
who
do
all
,
without
proceed
to
violence
,
in
their
power
to
detain
them
.
<EOS>
They
walk
as
fast
as
they
could
,
not
so
much
from
any
apprehension
of
be
pursue
as
that
Mr
Adams
may
,
by
exercise
,
prevent
any
harm
from
the
water

<EOS>
the
gentleman
,
who
have
give
such
order
to
his
servant
concern
Fanny
that
he
do
not
in
the
least
fear
her
get
away
,
no
sooner
hear
that
she
be
go
,
than
he
begin
to
rave
,
and
immediately
despatch
several
with
order
either
to
bring
her
back
or
never
return
.
<EOS>
the
poet
,
the
player
,
and
all
but
the
dancing
-
master
and
doctor
,
go
on
this
errand
.
  
<EOS>
the
night
be
very
dark
in
which
our
friend
begin
their
journey
;
however
,
they
make
such
expedition
,
that
they
soon
arrive
at
an
inn
which
be
at
seven
mile
'
distance
.
<EOS>
here
they
unanimously
consent
to
pass
the
evening
,
Mr
Adams
be
now
as
dry
as
he
be
before
he
have
set
out
on
his
embassy
.
  
<EOS>
this
inn
,
which
indeed
we
may
call
an
ale
-
house
,
have
not
the
word
,
the
New
Inn
,
be
writ
on
the
sign
,
afford
them
no
well
provision
than
bread
and
cheese
and
ale
;
on
which
,
however
,
they
make
a
very
comfortable
meal
;
for
hunger
be
well
than
a
french
cook
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
no
sooner
sup
,
than
Adams
,
return
thank
to
the
Almighty
for
his
food
,
declare
he
have
eat
his
homely
common
with
much
great
satisfaction
than
his
splendid
dinner
;
and
express
great
contempt
for
the
folly
of
mankind
,
who
sacrifice
their
hope
of
heaven
to
the
acquisition
of
vast
wealth
,
since
so
much
comfort
be
to
be
find
in
the
humble
state
and
the
low
provision
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
very
true
,
sir
,
"
say
a
grave
man
who
sit
smoake
his
pipe
by
the
fire
,
and
who
be
a
traveller
as
well
as
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
often
be
as
much
surprize
as
you
be
,
when
I
consider
the
value
which
mankind
in
general
set
on
rich
,
since
every
day
's
experience
show
us
how
little
be
in
their
power
;
for
what
,
indeed
,
truly
desirable
,
can
they
bestow
on
us
?
<EOS>
Can
they
give
beauty
to
the
deform
,
strength
to
the
weak
,
or
health
to
the
infirm
?
<EOS>
surely
if
they
could
we
should
not
see
so
many
ill
-
favour
face
haunt
the
assembly
of
the
great
,
nor
would
such
number
of
feeble
wretch
languish
in
their
coach
and
palace
.
<EOS>
no
,
not
the
wealth
of
a
kingdom
can
purchase
any
paint
to
dress
pale
Ugliness
in
the
bloom
of
that
young
maiden
,
nor
any
drug
to
equip
Disease
with
the
vigour
of
that
young
man
.
<EOS>
do
not
rich
bring
us
to
solicitude
instead
of
rest
,
envy
instead
of
affection
,
and
danger
instead
of
safety
?
<EOS>
Can
they
prolong
their
own
possession
,
or
lengthen
his
day
who
enjoy
them
?
<EOS>
so
far
otherwise
,
that
the
sloth
,
the
luxury
,
the
care
which
attend
them
,
shorten
the
life
of
million
,
and
bring
them
with
pain
and
misery
to
an
untimely
grave
.
<EOS>
where
,
then
,
be
their
value
if
they
can
neither
embellish
nor
strengthen
our
form
,
sweeten
nor
prolong
our
life
?
 
<EOS>
again
:
Can
they
adorn
the
mind
more
than
the
body
?
<EOS>
do
they
not
rather
swell
the
heart
with
vanity
,
puff
up
the
cheek
with
pride
,
shut
our
ear
to
every
call
of
virtue
,
and
our

to
every
motive
of
compassion
?
"
<EOS>
"
give
me
your
hand
,
brother

"
say
Adams
,
in
a
rapture
,
"
for
I
suppose
you
be
a
clergyman

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
truly

"
answer
the
other
(
indeed
,
he
be
a
priest
of
the
Church
of
Rome
;
but
those
who
understand
our
law
will
not
wonder
he
be
not

.
 
<EOS>
"
whatever
you

cry
Adams
,
"
you
have
speak
my
sentiment

I

I

preach
every

twenty

for
it

always
appear

by

the
true
rendering

that

easily
grant
you
by

be
deplorably
true

but
as
the
prospect
of
our
good
at
a
distance
doth
not
so
forcibly
affect
us
,
it
may
be
of
some
service
to
mankind
to
be
make
thoroughly
sensible
 
<EOS>
which
I
think
they
may
be
with
very
little
serious
attention
 
<EOS>
that
even
the
blessing
of
this
world
be
not
to
be
purchase
with
rich
;
a
doctrine
,
in
my
opinion
,
not
only
metaphysically
,
but
,
if
I
may
so
say
,
mathematically
demonstrable
;
and
which
I
have
be
always
so
perfectly
convinced
of
that
I
have
a
contempt
for
nothing
so
much
as
for
gold
.
<EOS>
"
Adams
now
begin
a
long
discourse
:
but
as
most
which
he
say
occur
among
many
author
who
have
treat
this
subject
,
I
shall
omit
insert
it
.
<EOS>
during
its
continuance
Joseph
and
Fanny
retire
to
rest
,
and
the
host
likewise
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
when
the
english
parson
have
conclude
,
the
Romish
resume
the
discourse
,
which
he
continue
with
great
bitterness
and
invective
;
and
at
last
end
by
desire
Adams
to
lend
him
eighteen
-
penny
to
pay
his
reckoning
;
promising
,
if
he
never
pay
him
,
he
may
be
assure
of
his
prayer
.
<EOS>
the
good
man
answer
that
eighteen
-
penny
would
be
too
little
to
carry
him
any
very
long
journey
;
that
he
have
half
a
guinea
in
his
pocket
,
which
he
would
divide
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
then
fall
to
search
his
pocket
,
but
could
find
no
money
;
for
indeed
the
company
with
whom
he
dine
have
pass
one
jest
upon
him
which
we
do
not
then
enumerate
,
and
have
pick
his
pocket
of
all
that
treasure
which
he
have
so
ostentatiously
produce
.
  
<EOS>
"
bless
me
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Adams
,
"
I
have
certainly
lose
it
;
I
can
never
have
spend
it
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
as
I
be
a
Christian

I
have
a
whole
half

guinea
in
my
pocket
this
morning

have
not
now
a

halfpenny
of
it

<EOS>
"
Sir

the

"
you

no

<EOS>
"
I
be
more
unlucky

quoth
the
other
,
"
if
you
be
as
generous

you

for
really
a

me
in

pennyless

just
arrive

we
be
force
by
a
storm
in
our
passage
to
throw
all
we

overboard

<EOS>
I
do
not
suspect

this
fellow
will
take
my
word
for
the
trifle
I
owe
him
;
but
I
hate
to
appear
<EOS>
so
mean
as
to
confess
myself
without
a
shilling
to
such
people
;
for
these
,
and
indeed
too
many
other
,
know
little
difference
in
their
estimation
between
a
beggar

a
thief

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
however
,
he
think
he
should
deal
better
with
the
host
that
evening
than
the
next
morning
:
he
therefore
resolve
to
set
out
immediately
,
notwithstanding
the
darkness
;
and
accordingly
,
as
soon
as
the
host
return
,
he
communicate
to
him
the
situation
of
his
affair
;
upon
which
the
host
,
scratch
his
head
,
answer
,
"
why
,
I
do
not
know
,
master
;
if
it

so

and
you
have
no
money

,
I
must
trust

I
think
,
though
I
have
rather
always
have
ready
money
if
I

marry

you
look

so
honest
a

that
I

"
the
priest
make
no
reply
,
but
,
take
leave
of
him
and
Adams
as
fast
as
he
could
,
not
without
confusion
,
and
perhaps
with
some
distrust
of
Adams
's
sincerity
,
depart
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
go
than
the
host
fall
a
-
shake
his
head
,
and
declare
,
if
he
have
suspect
the

have
no

he
would
not

draw
him
a

drop
of

his

again

that
he

a
confounded
rogue

<EOS>
"
rabbit
the
fellow

"
cry
he
,
"
I
think
,
by
his
talk
so
much
about
rich

that
he
have
a
hundred
pound
at

in
his
pocket

<EOS>
"
Adams
chid
him
for
his
suspicion
,
which
,
he
say
,
be
not
become
a
Christian
;
and
then
,
without
reflect
on
his
loss
,
or
consider
how
he
himself
should
depart
in
the
morning
,
he
retire
to
a
very
homely
bed
,
as
his
companion
have
before
;
however
,
health
and
fatigue
give
them
a
sweeter
repose
than
be
often
in
the
power
of
velvet
and
down
to
bestow

<EOS>
contain
as
surprizing
and
bloody
adventure
as
can
be
find
in
this
or
perhaps
any
other
authentic
history
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
almost
morning
when
Joseph
Andrews
,
whose
eye
the
thought
of
his
dear
Fanny
have
open
,
as
he
lie
fondly
meditate
on
that
lovely
creature
,
hear
a
violent
knocking
at
the
door
over
which
he
lie
.
<EOS>
He
presently
jump
out
of
bed
,
and
,
open
the
window
,
be
ask
if
there
be
no
traveller
in
the
house
?
<EOS>
and
presently
,
by
another
voice
,
if
two
man
and
a
woman
have
not
take
up
there
their
lodging
that
night
?
<EOS>
though
he
know
not
the
voice
,
he
begin
to
entertain
a
suspicion
of
the
truth
 
for
indeed
<EOS>
he
have
receive
some
information
from
one
of
the
servant
of
the
squire
's
house
of
his
design
 
and
answer
in
the
negative
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
servant
,
who
know
the
host
well
,
call
out
to
him
by
his
name
just
as
he
have
open
another
window
,
and
ask
him
the
same
question
;
to
which
he
answer
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
o
ho
!
say
another
,
have
we
find
you
?
<EOS>
and
order
the
host
to
come
down
and
open
his
door
.
<EOS>
Fanny
,
who
be
as
wakeful
as
Joseph
,
no
sooner
hear
all
this
than
she
leap
from
her
bed
,
and
,
hastily
put
on
her
gown
and
petticoat
,
run
as
fast
as
possible
to
Joseph
's
room
,
who
then
be
almost
dr
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
let
her
in
,
and
,
embrace
her
with
the
most
passionate
tenderness
,
bid
her
fear
nothing
,
for
he
would
die
in
her
defence
.
<EOS>
"
be
that
a
reason
why
I
should
not
fear
,
"
say
she
,
"
when
I
should
lose
what
be
dearer
to
me
than
the
whole
world
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Joseph
,
then
kiss
her
hand
,
say
,
"
He
could
almost
thank
the
occasion
which
have
extort
from
her
a
tenderness
she
would
never
indulge
him
with
before
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
run
and
wake
his
bedfellow
Adams
,
who
be
yet
fast
asleep
,
notwithstanding
many
call
from
Joseph
;
but
be
no
sooner
make
sensible
of
their
danger
than
he
leap
from
his
bed
,
without
consider
the
presence
of
Fanny
,
who
hastily
turn
her
face
from
him
,
and
enjoy
a
double
benefit
from
the
dark
,
which
,
as
it
would
have
prevent
any
offence
,
to
an
innocence
less
pure
,
or
a
modesty
less
delicate
,
so
it
conceal
even
those
blush
which
be
raise
in
her
.
  
<EOS>
Adams
have
soon
put
on
all
his
clothe
but
his
breech
,
which
,
in
the
hurry
,
he
forget
;
however
,
they
be
pretty
well
supply
by
the
length
of
his
other
garment
;
and
now
,
the
house
-
door
be
open
,
the
captain
,
the
poet
,
the
player
,
and
three
servant
come
in
.
<EOS>
the
captain
tell
the
host
that
two
fellow
,
who
be
in
his
house
,
have
run
away
with
a
young
woman
,
and
desire
to
know
in
which
room
she
lie
.
<EOS>
the
host
,
who
presently
believe
the
story
,
direct
them
,
and
instantly
the
captain
and
poet
,
justle
one
another
,
run
up
.
<EOS>
the
poet
,
who
be
the
nimblest
,
enter
the
chamber
first
,
search
the
bed
,
and
every
other
part
,
but
to
no
purpose
;
the
bird
be
fly
,
as
the
impatient
reader
,
who
may
otherwise
have
be
in
pain
for
her
,
be
before
advertise
.
<EOS>
They
then
enquire
where
the
man
lie
,
and
be
approach
the
chamber
,
when
Joseph
roar
out
,
in
a
loud
voice
,
that
he
would
shoot
the
first
man
who
offer
to
attack
the
door
.
<EOS>
the
captain
enquire
what
fire
-
arm
they
have
;
to
which
the
host
answer
,
he
believe
they
have
none
;
nay
,
he
be
almost
convinced
of
it
,
for
he
have
hear
one
ask
the
other
in
the
evening
what
they
should
have
do
if
they
have
be
overtake
,
when
they
have
no
arm
;
to
which
the
other
answer
,
they
would
have
defend
themselves
with
their
stick
as
long
as
they
be
able
,
and
God
would
assist
a
just
cause
.
<EOS>
this
satisfy
the
captain
,
but
not
the
poet
,
who
prudently
retreat
downstairs
,
say
,
it
be
his
business
to
record
great
action
,
and
not
to
do
them
.
<EOS>
the
captain
be
no
sooner
well
satisfied
that
there
be
no
fire
-
arm
than
,
bid
defiance
to
gunpowder
,
and
swear
he
love
the
smell
of
it
,
he
order
the
servant
to
follow
him
,
and
,
march
boldly
up
,
immediately
attempt
to
force
the
door
,
which
the
servant
soon
help
him
to
accomplish
.
<EOS>
when
it
be
open
,
they
discover
the
enemy
draw
up
three
deep
;
Adams
in
the
front
,
and
Fanny
in
the
rear
.
<EOS>
the
captain
tell
Adams
that
if
they
would
go
all
back
to
the
house
again
they
should
be
civilly
treat
;
but
unless
they
consent
he
have
order
to
carry
the
young
lady
with
him
,
whom
there
be
great
reason
to
believe
they
have
steal
from
her
parent
;
for
,
notwithstanding
her
disguise
,
her
air
,
which
she
could
not
conceal
,
sufficiently
discover
her
birth
to
be
infinitely
superior
to
theirs
.
<EOS>
Fanny
,
burst
into
tear
,
solemnly
assure
him
<EOS>
he
be
mistaken
;
that
she
be
a
poor
helpless
foundling
,
and
have
no
relation
in
the
world
which
she
know
of
;
and
,
throw
herself
on
her
knee
,
beg
that
he
would
not
attempt
to
take
her
from
her
friend
,
who
,
she
be
convince
,
would
die
before
they
would
lose
her
;
which
Adams
confirm
with
word
not
far
from
amount
to
an
oath
.
<EOS>
the
captain
swear
he
have
no
leisure
to
talk
,
and
,
bid
them
thank
themselves
for
what
happen
,
he
order
the
servant
to
fall
on
,
at
the
same
time
endeavour
to
pass
by
Adams
,
in
order
to
lay
hold
on
Fanny
;
but
the
parson
,
interrupt
him
,
receive
a
blow
from
one
of
them
,
which
,
without
consider
whence
it
come
,
he
return
to
the
captain
,
and
give
him
so
dexterous
a
knock
in
that
part
of
the
stomach
which
be
vulgarly
call
the
pit
,
that
he
stagger
some
pace
backwards
.
<EOS>
the
captain
,
who
be
not
accustom
to
this
kind
of
play
,
and
who
wisely
apprehend
the
consequence
of
such
another
blow
,
two
of
them
seem
to
him
equal
to
a
thrust
through
the
body
,
draw
forth
his
hanger
,
as
Adams
approach
him
,
and
be
level
a
blow
at
his
head
,
which
would
probably
have
silence
the
preacher
for
ever
,
have
not
Joseph
in
that
instant
lift
up
a
certain
huge
stone
pot
of
the
chamber
with
one
hand
,
which
six
beau
could
not
have
lift
with
both
,
and
discharge
it
,
together
with
the
content
,
full
in
the
captain
's
face
.
<EOS>
the
uplifted
hanger
drop
from
his
hand
,
and
he
fall
prostrate
on
the
floor
with
a
lumpish
noise
,
and
his
halfpence
rattle
in
his
pocket
;
the
red
liquor
which
his
vein
contain
,
and
the
white
liquor
which
the
pot
contain
,
run
in
one
stream
down
his
face
and
his
clothe
.
<EOS>
nor
have
Adams
quite
escape
,
some
of
the
water
have
in
its
passage
shed
its
honour
on
his
head
,
and
begin
to
trickle
down
the
wrinkle
or
rather
furrow
of
his
cheek
,
when
one
of
the
servant
,
snatch
a
mop
out
of
a
pail
of
water
,
which
have
already
do
its
duty
in
wash
the
house
,
push
it
in
the
parson
's
face
;
yet
could
not
he
bear
him
down
,
for
the
parson
,
wrest
the
mop
from
the
fellow
with
one
hand
,
with
the
other
bring
his
enemy
as
low
as
the
earth
,
have
give
him
a
stroke
over
that
part
of
the
face
where
,
in
some
man
of
pleasure
,
the
natural
and
artificial
nose
be
conjoin
.
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
Fortune
seem
to
incline
the
victory
on
the
traveller
'
side
,
when
,
accord
to
her
custom
,
she
begin
to
show
the
fickleness
of
her
disposition
;
for
now
the
host
,
enter
the
field
,
or
rather
chamber
of
battle
,
fly
directly
at
Joseph
,
and
,
dart
his
head
into
his
stomach
(
for
he
be
a
stout
fellow
and
an
expert
boxer
)
,
almost
stagger
him
:
but
Joseph
,
step
one
leg
back
,
do
with
his
left
hand
so
chuck
him
under
the
chin
that
he
reel
.
<EOS>
the
youth
be
pursue
his
blow
with
his
right
hand
when
he
receive
from
one
of
the
servant
such
a
stroke
with
a
cudgel
on
his
temple
,
that
it
instantly
deprive
him
of
sense
,
and
he
measure
his
length
on
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
rent
the
air
with
her
cry
,
and
Adams
be
come
to
the
assistance
of
Joseph
;
but
the
two
serve
-
man
and
the
host
now
fall
on
him
,
and
soon
subdue
him
,
though
he
fight
like
a
madman
,
and
look
so
black
with
the
impression
he
have
receive
from
the
mop
,
that
Don
Quixote
would
certainly
have
take
him
for
an
inchanted
Moor
.
<EOS>
but
now
follow
the
most
tragical
part
;
for
the
captain
be
rise
again
,
and
,
see
Joseph
on
the
floor
,
and
Adams
secure
,
he
instantly
lay
hold
on
Fanny
,
and
,
with
the
assistance
of
the
poet
and
player
,
who
,
hear
the
battle
be
over
,
be
now
come
up
,
drag
her
,
cry
and
tear
her
hair
,
from
the
sight
of
her
Joseph
,
and
,
with
a
perfect
deafness
to
all
her
entreaty
,
carry
her
downstairs
by
violence
,
and
fasten
her
on
the
player
's
horse
;
and
the
captain
,
mount
his
own
,
and
lead
that
on
which
this
poor
miserable
wretch
be
,
depart
,
without
any
more
consideration
of
her
cry
than
a
butcher
hath
of
those
of
a
lamb
;
for
indeed
his
thought
be
entertain
only
with
the
degree
of
favour
which
he
promise
himself
from
the
squire
on
the
success
of
this
adventure
.
  
<EOS>
the
servant
,
who
be
order
to
secure
Adams
and
Joseph
as
safe
as
possible
,
that
the
squire
may
receive
no
interruption
to
his
design
on
poor
Fanny
,
immediately
,
by
the
poet
's
advice
,
tie
Adams
to
one
of
the
bed
-
post
,
as
they
do
Joseph
on
the
other
side
,
as
soon
as
they
could
bring
him
to
himself
;
and
then
,
leave
them
together
,
back
to
back
,
and
desire
the
host
not
to
set
them
at
liberty
,
nor
to
go
near
them
,
till
he
have
further
order
,
they
depart
towards
their
master
;
but
happen
to
take
a
different
road
from
that
which
the
captain
have
fall
into
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
a
discourse
between
the
poet
and
the
player
;
of
no
other
use
in
this
history
but
to
divert
the
reader
.
  
<EOS>
before
we
proceed
any
farther
in
this
tragedy
we
shall
leave
Mr
Joseph
and
Mr
Adams
to
themselves
,
and
imitate
the
wise
conductor
of
the
stage
,
who
in
the
midst
of
a
grave
action
entertain
you
with
some
excellent
piece
of
satire
or
humour
call
a
dance
.
<EOS>
which
piece
,
indeed
,
be
therefore
dance
,
and
not
speak
,
as
it
be
deliver
to
the
audience
by
person
whose
thinking
faculty
be
by
most
people
hold
to
lie
in
their
heel
;
and
to
whom
,
as
well
as
hero
,
who
think
with
their
hand
,
nature
hath
only
give
head
for
the
sake
of
conformity
,
and
as
they
be
of
use
in
dancing
,
to
hang
their
hat
on
.
  
<EOS>
the
poet
,
address
the
player
,
proceed
thus
,
"
as
I
be
say
"
(
for
they
have
be
at
this
discourse
all
the
time
of
the
engagement
above
-
stair
)
,
"
the
reason
you
have
no
good
new
play
be
evident
;
it
be
from
your
discouragement
of
author
.
<EOS>
gentleman
will
not
write
,
sir
,
they
will
not
write
,
without
the
expectation
of
fame
or
profit
,
or
perhaps
both
.
<EOS>
play
be
like
tree
,
which
will
not
grow
without
nourishment
;
but
like
mushroom
,
they
shoot
up
spontaneously
,
as
it
be
,
in
a
rich
soil
.
<EOS>
the
muse
,
like
vine
,
may
be
prune
,
but
not
with
a
hatchet
.
<EOS>
the
town
,
like
a
peevish
child
,
know
not
what
it
desire
,
and
be
always
best
pleased
with
a
rattle
.
<EOS>
a
farce
-
writer
hath
indeed
<EOS>
some
chance
for
success
:
but
they
have
lose
all
taste
for
the
sublime
.
<EOS>
though
I
believe
one
reason
of
their
depravity
be
the
badness
of
the
actor
.
<EOS>
if
a
man
write
like
an
angel
,
sir
,
those
fellow
know
not
how
to
give
a
sentiment
utterance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
so
fast
,
"
say
the
player
:
"
the
modern
actor
be
as
good
at
least
as
their
author
,
nay
,
they
come
near
their
illustrious
predecessor
;
and
I
expect
a
Booth
on
the
stage
again
,
sooner
than
a
Shakespear
or
an
otway
;
and
indeed
I
may
turn
your
observation
against
you
,
and
with
truth
say
,
that
the
reason
no
author
be
encourage
be
because
we
have
no
good
new
play
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
affirm
the
contrary
,
"
say
the
poet
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
be
surprize
you
grow
so
warm
;
you
can
not
imagine
yourself
interested
in
this
dispute
;
I
hope
you
have
a
well
opinion
of
my
taste
than
to
apprehend
I
squint
at
yourself
.
<EOS>
no
,
sir
,
if
we
have
six
such
actor
as
you
,
we
should
soon
rival
the
Bettertons
and
Sandfords
of
former
time
;
for
,
without
a
compliment
to
you
,
I
think
it
impossible
for
any
one
to
have
excel
you
in
most
of
your
part
.
<EOS>
nay
,
it
be
solemn
truth
,
and
I
have
hear
many
,
and
all
great
judge
,
express
as
much
;
and
,
you
will
pardon
me
if
I
tell
you
,
I
think
every
time
I
have
see
you
lately
you
have
constantly
acquire
some
new
excellence
,
like
a
snowball
.
<EOS>
You
have
deceive
me
in
my
estimation
of
perfection
,
and
have
outdo
what
I
think
inimitable
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
as
little
interested
,
"
answer
the
player
,
"
in
what
I
have
say
of
other
poet
;
for
d####n
me
if
there
be
not
many
stroke
,
ay
,
whole
scene
,
in
your
last
tragedy
,
which
at
least
equal
Shakespear
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
delicacy
of
sentiment
,
a
dignity
of
expression
in
it
,
which
I
will
own
many
of
our
gentleman
do
not
do
adequate
justice
to
.
<EOS>
to
confess
the
truth
,
they
be
bad
enough
,
and
I
pity
an
author
who
be
present
at
the
murder
of
his
work
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
it
be
but
seldom
that
it
can
happen
,
"
return
the
poet
;
"
the
work
of
most
modern
author
,
like
dead
-
bear
child
,
can
not
be
murder
.
<EOS>
It
be
such
wretched
half
-
begotten
,
half
-
writ
,
lifeless
,
spiritless
,
low
,
grovel
stuff
,
that
I
almost
pity
<EOS>
the
actor
who
be
oblige
to
get
it
by
heart
,
which
must
be
almost
as
difficult
to
remember
as
word
in
a
language
you
do
not
understand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
"
say
the
player
,
"
if
the
sentence
have
little
meaning
when
they
be
writ
,
when
they
be
speak
they
have
less
.
<EOS>
I
know
scarce
one
who
ever
lay
an
emphasis
right
,
and
much
less
adapt
his
action
to
his
character
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
a
tender
lover
in
an
attitude
of
fighting
with
his
mistress
,
and
a
brave
hero
sue
to
his
enemy
with
his
sword
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
to
abuse
my
profession
,
but
rot
me
if
in
my
heart
I
be
not
incline
to
the
poet
's
side
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
rather
generous
in
you
than
just
,
"

"
I

you
remember
the
affair

you

indeed

I

groan

make
of
a
certain
composition
not

its

you
may
strike
fire
from

I

"
<EOS>
his
eye
overflow
with
tear
,
which
would
have
become
any

a
hero

<EOS>
in
a
word
,
his
despair
be
more
easy
to

<EOS>
Mr
Adams
,
after
many
groan
,
sit
with
his
back
to
Joseph
,
begin
thus
in
a
sorrowful
tone
:
"
You
can
not
imagine
,
my
good
child
,
that
I
entirely
blame
these
first
agony
of
your
grief
;
for
,
when
misfortune
attack
us
by
surprize
,
it
must
require
infinitely
more
learning
than
you
be
master
of
to
resist
them
;
but
it
be
the
business
of
a
man
and
a
Christian
to
summon
Reason
as
quickly
as
he
can
to
his
aid
;
and
she
will
presently
teach
him
patience
and
submission
.
<EOS>
be
comfort
,
therefore
,
child
;
I
say
be
comfort
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
you
have
lose
the
prettiest
,
kind
,
lovely
,
sweetest
young
woman
,
one
with
whom
you
may
have
expect
to
have
live
in
happiness
,
virtue
,
and
innocence
;
by
whom
you
may
have
promise
yourself
many
little
darling
,
who
would
have
be
the
delight
of
your
youth
and
the
comfort
of
your
age
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
only
lose
her
,
but
have
reason
to
fear
the
utmost
violence
which
lust
and
power
can
inflict
upon
her
.
<EOS>
now
,
indeed
,
you
may
easily
raise
idea
of
horror
,
which
may
drive
you
to
despair
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
o
I
shall
run
mad
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Joseph
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
o
that
I
could
but
command
my
hand
to
tear
my
eye
out
and
my
flesh
off
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
would
use
them
to
such
purpose
,
I
be
glad
you
can
not
,
"
answer
Adams
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
state
your
misfortune
as
strong
as
I
possibly
can
;
but
,
on
the
other
side
,
you
be
to
consider
you
be
a
Christian
,
that
no
accident
happen
to
us
without
the
Divine
permission
,
and
that
it
be
the
duty
of
a
man
,
and
a
Christian
,
to
submit
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
make
ourselves
;
but
the
same
power
which
make
us
rule
over
us
,
and
we
be
absolutely
at
his
disposal
;
he
may
do
with
us
what
he
please
,
nor
have
we
any
right
to
complain
.
<EOS>
a
second
reason
against
our
complaint
be
our
ignorance
;
for
,
as
we
know
not
future
event
,
so
neither
can
we
tell
to
what
purpose
any
accident
tend
;
and
that
which
at
first
threaten
us
with
evil
may
in
the
end
produce
our
good
.
<EOS>
I
should
indeed
have
say
our
ignorance
be
twofold
<EOS>
(
but
I
have
not
at
present
time
to
divide
properly
)
,
for
,
as
we
know
not
to
what
purpose
any
event
be
ultimately
direct
,
so
neither
can
we
affirm
from
what
cause
it
originally
spring
.
<EOS>
You
be
a
man
,
and
consequently
a
sinner
;
and
this
may
be
a
punishment
to
you
for
your
sin
:
indeed
in
this
sense
it
may
be
esteem
as
a
good
,
yea
,
as
the
great
good
,
which
satisfy
the
anger
of
Heaven
,
and
avert
that
wrath
which
can
not
continue
without
our
destruction
.
<EOS>
thirdly
,
our
impotency
of
relieve
ourselves
demonstrate
the
folly
and
absurdity
of
our
complaint
:
for
whom
do
we
resist
,
or
against
whom
do
we
complain
,
but
a
power
from
whose
shaft
no
armour
can
guard
us
,
no
speed
can
fly
?
 
<EOS>
a
power
which
leave
us
no
hope
but
in
submission
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
O
sir
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Joseph
,
"
all
this
be
very
true
,
and
very
fine
,
and
I
could
hear
you
all
day
if
I
be
not
so
grieve
at
heart
as
now
I
be

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Would
you
take
physic
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
when
you
be
well
,
and
refuse
it
when
you
be
sick

<EOS>
be
not
comfort
to
be
administer
to
the
afflict
,
and
not
to
those
who
rejoice
or
those
who
be
at
ease

"
<EOS>
"
o
!
<EOS>
you
have
not

one
word
of
comfort
to
me

return
Joseph
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
!

<EOS>
cry
Adams
;
"
what
be
I
then
do
?
<EOS>
what
can
I
say
to
comfort
you
?
"
<EOS>
"
o
tell
me
,
"
cry
Joseph
,
"
that
Fanny
will
escape
back
to
my
arm
,
that
they
shall
again
enclose
that
lovely
creature
,
with
all
her
sweetness
,
all
her
untainted
innocence
about
her
!
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
perhaps
you
may
,
"
cry
Adams
,
"
but
<EOS>
I
can
not
promise
you
what
be
to
come
.
<EOS>
You
must
,
with
perfect
resignation
,
wait
the
event
:
if
she
be
restore
to
you
again
,
it
be
your
duty
to
be
thankful
,
and
so
it
be
if
she
be
not
.
<EOS>
Joseph
,
if
you
be
wise
and
truly
know
your
own
interest
,
you
will
peaceably
and
quietly
submit
to
all
the
dispensation
of
Providence
,
be
thoroughly
assure
that
all
the
misfortune
,
how
great
soever
,
which
happen
to
the
righteous
,
happen
to
them
for
their
own
good
.
<EOS>
nay
,
it
be
not
your
interest
only
,
but
your
duty
,
to
abstain
from
immoderate
grief
;
which
if
you
indulge
,
you
be
not
worthy
the
name
of
a
Christian
.
"
<EOS>
He
speak
these
last
word
with
an
accent
a
little
severe
than
usual
;
upon
which
Joseph
beg
him
not
to
be
angry
,
say
,
he
mistake
him
if
he
think
he
deny
it
be
his
duty
,
for
he
have
know
that
long
ago
.
<EOS>
"
what
signify
know
your
duty
,
if
you
do
not
perform
it
?
"
answer
Adams
.
<EOS>
"
Your
knowledge
increase
your
guilt
.
<EOS>
o
Joseph
!
<EOS>
I
never
think
you
have
this
stubbornness
in
your
mind
.
"
<EOS>
Joseph
reply
,
"
He
fancy
he
misunderstand
him
;
which
I
assure
you
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
do
,
if
you
imagine
I
endeavour
to
grieve
;
upon
my
soul
I
do
not
.
"
<EOS>
Adams
rebuke
him
for
swear
,
and
then
proceed
to
enlarge
on
the
folly
of
grief
,
tell
him
,
all
the
wise
man
and
philosopher
,
even
among
the
heathen
,
have
write
against
it
,
quote
several
passage
from
Seneca
,
and
the
Consolation
,
which
,
though
it
be
not
Cicero
's
,
be
,
he
say
,
as
good
almost
as
any
of
his
work
;
and
conclude
all
by
hint
that
immoderate
grief
in
this
case
may
incense
that
power
which
alone
could
restore
him
his
Fanny
.
<EOS>
this
reason
,
or
indeed
rather
the
idea
which
it
raise
of
the
restoration
of
his
mistress
,
have
more
effect
than
all
which
the
parson
have
say
before
,
and
for
a
moment
abate
his
agony
;
but
,
when
his
fear
sufficiently
set
before
his
eye
the
danger
that
poor
creature
be
in
,
his
grief
return
again
with
repeat
violence
,
nor
could
Adams
in
the
least
asswage
it
;
though
it
may
be
doubt
in
his
behalf
whether
Socrates
himself
could
have
prevail
any
better
.
  
<EOS>
They
remain
some
time
in
silence
,
and
groan
and
sigh
issue
from
them
both
;
at
length
Joseph
burst
out
into
the
follow
soliloquy
:
        
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
will
bear
my
sorrow
like
a
man
,
    
<EOS>
but
I
must
also
feel
them
as
a
man
.
    
<EOS>
I
can
not
but
remember
such
thing
be
,
    
and
be
most
dear
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adams
ask
him
what
stuff
that
be
he
repeat
?
<EOS>
to
which
he
answer
,
they
be
some
line
he
have
get
by
heart
out
of
a
play
.
"
<EOS>
ay
,
there
be
nothing
but
heathenism
to
be
learn
from
play
,
"
reply
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
hear
of
any
play
fit
for
a
Christian
to
read
,
but
Cato
and
the
Conscious
Lovers
;
and
,
I
must
own
,
<EOS>
in
the
latter
there
be
some
thing
almost
solemn
enough
for
a
sermon
.
"
<EOS>
but
we
shall
now
leave
them
a
little
,
and
enquire
after
the
subject
of
their
conversation
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
More
adventure
,
which
we
hope
will
as
much
please
as
surprize
the
reader
.
  
<EOS>
neither
the
facetious
dialogue
which
pass
between
the
poet
and
the
player
,
nor
the
grave
and
truly
solemn
discourse
of
Mr
Adams
,
will
,
we
conceive
,
make
the
reader
sufficient
amend
for
the
anxiety
which
he
must
have
feel
on
the
account
of
poor
Fanny
,
whom
we
leave
in
so
deplorable
a
condition
.
<EOS>
We
shall
therefore
now
proceed
to
the
relation
of
what
happen
to
that
beautiful
and
innocent
virgin
,
after
she
fall
into
the
wicked
hand
of
the
captain
.
  
<EOS>
the
man
of
war
,
have
convey
his
charming
prize
out
of
the
inn
a
little
before
day
,
make
the
utmost
expedition
in
his
power
towards
the
squire
's
house
,
where
this
delicate
creature
be
to
be
offer
up
a
sacrifice
to
the
lust
of
a
ravisher
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
only
deaf
to
all
her
bewailing
and
entreaty
on
the
road
,
but
accost
her
ear
with
impurity
which
,
have
be
never
before
accustomed
to
them
,
she
happily
for
herself
very
little
understand
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
change
his
note
,
and
attempt
to
soothe
and
mollify
her
,
by
set
forth
the
splendor
and
luxury
which
would
be
her
fortune
with
a
man
who
would
have
the
inclination
,
and
power
too
,
to
give
her
whatever
her
utmost
wish
could
desire
;
and
tell
her
he
doubt
<EOS>
not
<EOS>
but
she
would
soon
look
kind
on
him
,
as
the
instrument
of
her
happiness
,
and
despise
that
pitiful
fellow
whom
her
ignorance
only
could
make
her
fond
of
.
<EOS>
She
answer
,
she
know
not
whom
he
mean
;
she
never
be
fond
of
any
pitiful
fellow
.
"
<EOS>
be
you
affront
,
madam
,
"
say
he
,
"
at
my
call
him
so
?
<EOS>
but
what
better
can
be
say
of
one
in
a
livery
,
notwithstanding
your
fondness
for
him
?
"
<EOS>
She
return
,
that
she
do
not
understand
him
,
that
the
man
have
be
her
fellow
-
servant
,
and
she
believe
be
as
honest
a
creature
as
any
alive
;
but
as
for
fondness
for
man
 
<EOS>
"
I
warrant
ye
,
"
cry
the
captain
<EOS>
,
"
we
shall
find
mean
to
persuade
you
to
be
fond
;
and
I
advise
you
to
yield
to
gentle
one
,
for
you
may
be
assure
that
it
be
not
in
your
power
,
by
any
struggle
whatever
,
to
preserve
your
virginity
two
hour
longer
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
your
interest
to
consent
;
for
the
squire
will
be
much
kind
to
you
if
he
enjoy
you
willingly
than
by
force
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
at
which
word
she
begin
to
call
aloud
for
assistance
(
for
it
be
now
open
day
)
,
but
,
find
none
,
she
lift
her
eye
to
heaven
,
and
supplicate
the
Divine
assistance
to
preserve
her
innocence
.
<EOS>
the
captain
tell
her
,
if
she
persist
in
her
vociferation
,
he
would
find
a
means
of
stop
her
mouth
.
<EOS>
and
now
the
poor
wretch
,
perceive
no
hope
of
succour
,
abandon
herself
to
despair
,
and
,
sigh
out
the
name
of
Joseph
!
<EOS>
Joseph
!
<EOS>
a
river
of
tear
run
down
her
lovely
cheek
,
and
wet
the
handkerchief
which
cover
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
a
horseman
now
appear
in
the
road
,
upon
which
the
captain
threaten
her
violently
if
she
complain
;
however
,
the
moment
they
approach
each
other
she
beg
him
with
the
utmost
earnestness
to
relieve
a
distressed
creature
who
be
in
the
hand
of
a
ravisher
.
<EOS>
the
fellow
stopt
at
those
word
,
but
the
captain
assure
him
it
be
his
wife
,
and
that
he
be
carry
her
home
from
her
adulterer
,
which
so
satisfy
the
fellow
,
who
be
an
old
one
(
and
perhaps
a
married
one
too
)
,
that
he
wish
him
a
good
journey
,
and
ride
on
.
<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
past
than
the
captain
abuse
her
violently
for
break
his
command
,
and
threaten
to
gagg
her
,
when
two
more
horseman
,
arm
with
pistol
,
come
into
the
road
just
before
them
.
<EOS>
She
again
solicit
their
assistance
,
and
the
captain
tell
the
same
story
as
before
.
<EOS>
upon
which
one
say
to
the
other
,
"
that
be
a
charming
wench
,
Jack
;
I
wish
I
have
be
in
the
fellow
's
place
,
whoever
he
be
.
"
<EOS>
but
the
other
,
instead
of
answer
him
,
cry
out
,
"
zounds
,
I
know
her
;
"
and
then
,
turn
to
her
,
say
,
"
sure
you
be
not
Fanny
Goodwill
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
indeed
,
I
be
,
"
she
cry
 
"
O
John
<EOS>
,
I
know
you
now
<EOS>
-
Heaven
hath
send
you
to
my
assistance
,
to
deliver
me
from
this
wicked
man

who
be
carry
me
away
for
his
vile
purpose
 
o
for
God
's
sake
rescue
me
from
him
!
"
<EOS>
a
fierce
dialogue
immediately
ensue
between
the
captain
and
these
two
man
,
who
,
be
both
arm
with
pistol
,
and
the
chariot
which
they
attend
be
now
arrive
<EOS>
,
the
captain
see
both
force
and
stratagem
be
vain
,
and
endeavour
to
make
his
escape
,
in
which
however
he
could
not
succeed
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
who
ride
in
the
chariot
order
it
to
stop
,
and
with
an
air
of
authority
examine
into
the
merit
of
the
cause
;
of
which
be
advertise
by
Fanny
,
whose
credit
be
confirm
by
the
fellow
who
know
her
,
he
order
the
captain
,
who
be
all
bloody
from
his
encounter
at
the
inn
,
to
be
convey
as
a
prisoner
behind
the
chariot
,
and
very
gallantly
take
Fanny
into
it
;
for
,
to
say
the
truth
,
this
gentleman
(
who
be
no
other
than
the
celebrated
Mr
Peter
Pounce
,
and
who
precede
the
Lady
Booby
only
a
few
mile
,
by
set
out
earlier
in
the
morning
)
be
a
very
gallant
person
,
and
love
a
pretty
girl
better
than
anything
besides
his
own
money
or
the
money
of
other
people
.
  
<EOS>
the
chariot
now
proceed
towards
the
inn
,
which
,
as
Fanny
be
inform
,
lie
in
their
way
,
and
where
it
arrive
at
that
very
time
while
the
poet
and
player
be
dispute
below
-
stair
,
and
Adams
and
Joseph
be
discourse
back
to
back
above
;
just
at
that
period
to
which
we
bring
them
both
in
the
two
precede
chapter
the
chariot
stopt
at
the
door
,
and
in
an
instant
Fanny
,
leap
from
it
,
run
up
to
her
Joseph
.
 
<EOS>
o
reader
!
<EOS>
conceive
if
thou
canst
the
joy
which
fire
the
breast
of
these
lover
on
this
meeting
;
and
if
thy
own
heart
doth
not
sympathetically
assist
thee
in
this
conception
,
I
pity
thee
sincerely
from
my
own
;
for
let
the
hard
-
hearted
villain
know
this
,
that
there
be
a
pleasure
in
a
tender
sensation
beyond
any
which
he
be
capable
of
taste
.
  
<EOS>
Peter
,
be
inform
by
Fanny
of
the
presence
of
Adams
,
stopt
to
see
him
,
and
receive
his
homage
;
for
,
as
Peter
be
an
hypocrite
,
a
sort
of
people
whom
Mr
Adams
never
see
through
,
the
one
pay
that
respect
to
his
seeming
goodness
which
the
other
believe
to
be
pay
to
his
riches
;
hence
Mr
Adams
be
so
much
his
favourite
,
that
he
once
lend
him
four
pound
thirteen
shilling
and
sixpence
to
prevent
his
go
to
gaol
,
on
no
great
security
than
a
bond
and
judgment
,
which
probably
he
would
have
make
no
use
of
,
though
the
money
have
not
be
(
as
it
be
)
pay
exactly
at
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
perhaps
easy
to
describe
the
figure
of
Adams
;
he
have
rise
in
such
a
hurry
,
that
he
have
on
neither
breech
,
garter
,
nor
stocking
;
nor
have
he
take
from
his
head
a
red
spot
handkerchief
,
which
by
night
bind
his
wig
,
turn
inside
out
,
around
his
head
.
<EOS>
He
have
on
his
tear
cassock
and
his
greatcoat
;
but
,
as
the
remainder
of
his
cassock
hang
down
below
his
greatcoat
,
so
do
a
small
stripe
of
white
,
or
rather
whitish
,
linen
appear
below
that
;
to
which
we
may
add
the
several
colour
which
appear
on
his
face
,
where
a
long
piss
-
burn
beard
serve
to
retain
the
liquor
of
the
stone
-
pot
,
and
that
of
a
blacker
hue
which
distil
from
the
mop
.
 
<EOS>
this
figure
,
which
Fanny
have
deliver
from
his
captivity
,
be
no
sooner
spy
by
Peter
than
it
disorder
the
compose
gravity
of
his
muscle
;
however
,
he
advise
him
immediately
to
make
himself
clean
,
nor
would
accept
his
homage
in
that
pickle
.
  
<EOS>
the
poet
and
player
no
sooner
see
the
captain
in
captivity
than
they
begin
to
consider
of
their
own
safety
,
of
which
flight
present
itself
as
the
only
mean
;
they
therefore
both
of
them
mount
the
poet
's
horse
,
and
make
the
most
expeditious
retreat
in
their
power
.
  
<EOS>
the
host
,
who
well
know
Mr
Pounce
and
Lady
Booby
's
livery
,
be
not
a
little
surprized
at
this
change
of
the
scene
;
nor
be
his
confusion
much
help
by
his
wife
,
who
be
now
just
rise
,
and
,
have
hear
from
him
the
account
of
what
have
pass
,
comfort
him
with
a
decent
number
of
fool
and
blockhead
;
ask
him
why
he
do
not
consult
her
,
and
tell
him
he
would
never
leave
follow
the
nonsensical
dictate
of
his
own
numskull
till
she
and
her
family
be
ruin
.
  
<EOS>
Joseph
,
be
inform
of
the
captain
's
arrival
,
and
see
his
Fanny
now
in
safety
,
quit
her
a
moment
,
and
,
run
downstairs
,
go
directly
to
him
,
and
strip
off
his
coat
,
challenge
him
to
fight
;
but
the
captain
refuse
,
say
he
do
not
understand
box
.
<EOS>
He
then
grasp
a
cudgel
in
one
hand
,
and
,
catch
the
captain
by
the
collar
with
the
other
,
give
him
a
most
severe
drubbing
,
and
end
with
tell
him
he
have
now
have
some
revenge
for
what
his
dear
Fanny
have
suffer
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mr
Pounce
have
a
little
regale
himself
with
some
provision
which
he
have
in
his
chariot
,
and
Mr
Adams
have
put
on
the
good
appearance
his
clothe
would
allow
him
,
Pounce
order
the
captain
into
his
presence
,
for
he
say
he
be
guilty
of
felony
,
and
the
next
justice
of
peace
should
commit
him
;
but
the
servant
(
whose
appetite
for
revenge
be
soon
satisfied
)
,
be
sufficiently
content
with
the
drubbing
which
Joseph
have
inflict
on
him
,
and
which
be
indeed
of
no
very
moderate
kind
,
have
suffer
him
to
go
off
,
which
he
do
,
threaten
a
severe
revenge
against
Joseph
,
which
I
have
never
hear
he
think
proper
to
take
.
  
<EOS>
the
mistress
of
the
house
make
her
voluntary
appearance
before
Mr
Pounce
,
and
with
a
thousand
curtsy
tell
him
,
"
She
hope
his
honour
would
pardon
her
husband
,
who
be
a
very
nonsense
man
,
for
the
sake
of
his
poor
family
;
that
indeed
if
he
could
be
ruin
alone
,
she
should
be
very
willing
of
it
;
for
because
as
why
,
his
worship
very
well
know
he
deserve
it
;
but
she
have
three
poor
small
child
,
who
be
not
capable
to
get
their
own
living
;
and
if
her
husband
be
send
to
gaol
,
they
must
all
come
to
the
parish
;
for
she
be
a
poor
weak
woman
,
continually
a
-
breeding
,
and
have
no
time
to
work
for
them
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
hope
his
honour
would
take
it
into
his
worship
's
consideration
,
and
forgive
her
husband
this
time
;
for
she
be
sure
he
never
intend
any
harm
to
man
,
woman
,
or
child
;
and
if
it
be
not
for
that
block
-
head
of
his
own
,
the
man
in
some
thing
be
well
enough
;
for
she
have
have
three
child
by
him
in
less
than
three
year
,
and
be
almost
ready
to
cry
out
the
fourth
time
.
<EOS>
"
She
would
have
proceed
in
this
manner
much
longer
,
have
not
Peter
stopt
her
tongue
,
by
tell
her
he
have
nothing
to
say
to
her
husband
nor
her
neither
.
<EOS>
so
,
as
Adams
and
the
rest
have
assure
her
of
forgiveness
,
she
cry
and
curtsy
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Pounce
be
desirous
that
Fanny
should
continue
her
journey
with
him
in
the
chariot
;
but
she
absolutely
refuse
,
say
she
would
ride
behind
Joseph
on
a
horse
which
one
of
Lady
Booby
's
servant
have
equip
him
with
.
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
when
the
horse
appear
,
it
be
find
to
be
no
other
than
that
identical
beast
which
Mr
Adams
have
leave
behind
him
at
the
inn
,
and
which
these
honest
fellow
,
who
know
him
,
have
redeem
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
whatever
horse
they
have
provide
for
Joseph
,
they
would
have
prevail
with
him
to
mount
none
,
no
,
not
even
to
ride
before
his
beloved
Fanny
,
till
the
parson
be
supply
;
much
less
would
he
deprive
his
friend
of
the
beast
which
belong
to
him
,
and
which
he
know
the
moment
he
see
,
though
Adams
do
not
;
however
,
when
he
be
remind
of
the
affair
,
and
tell
that
they
have
bring
the
horse
with
them
which
he
leave
behind
,
he
answer
 
bless
me
!
<EOS>
and
so
I
do
.
  
<EOS>
Adams
be
very
desirous
that
Joseph
and
Fanny
should
mount
this
horse
,
and
declare
he
could
very
easily
walk
home
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
walk
alone
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
would
wage
a
shilling
that
the
pedestrian
outstrip
the
equestrian
traveller
;
but
,
as
I
intend
to
take
the
company
of
a
pipe
,
peradventure
I
may
be
an
hour
later
.
<EOS>
"
one
of
the
servant
whisper
Joseph
to
take
him
at
his
word
,
and
suffer
the
old
put
to
walk
if
he
would
:
this
proposal
be
answer
with
an
angry
look
and
a
peremptory
refusal
by
Joseph
,
who
,
catch
Fanny
up
in
his
arm
,
aver
he
would
rather
carry
her
home
in
that
manner
,
than
take
away
Mr
Adams
's
horse
and
permit
him
to
walk
on
foot
.

perhaps
,
reader
,
thou
hast
see
a
contest
between
two
gentleman
,
or
two
lady
,
quickly
decide
,
though
they
have
both
assert
they
would
not
eat
such
a
nice
morsel
,
and
each
insist
on
the
other
's
accept
it
;
but
in
reality
both
be
very
desirous
to
swallow
it
themselves
.
<EOS>
do
not
therefore
conclude
hence
that
this
dispute
would
have
come
to
a
speedy
decision
:
for
here
both
party
be
heartily
in
earnest
,
and
it
be
very
probable
they
would
have
remain
in
the
inn
-
yard
to
this
day
,
have
not
the
good
Peter
Pounce
put
a
stop
to
it
;
for
,
find
he
have
no
longer
hope
of
satisfy
his
old
appetite
with
Fanny
,
and
be
desirous
of
have
some
one
to
whom
he
may
communicate
his
grandeur
,
he
tell
the
parson
he
would
convey
him
home
in
his
chariot
.
<EOS>
this
favour
be
by
Adams
,
with
many
bow
and
acknowledgment
,
accept
,
though
he
afterwards
say
,
"
he
ascend
the
chariot
rather
that
he
may
not
offend
than
from
any
desire
of
ride
in
it
,
for
that
in
his
heart
he
prefer
the
pedestrian
even
to
the
vehicular
expedition
.
<EOS>
"
all
matter
be
now
settle
,
the
chariot
,
in
which
ride
Adams
and
Pounce
,
move
forwards
;
and
Joseph
have
borrow
a
pillion
from
the
host
,
Fanny
have
just
seat
herself
thereon
,
and
have
lay
hold
of
the
girdle
which
her
lover
wear
for
that
purpose
,
when
the
wise
beast
,
who
conclude
that
one
at
a
time
be
sufficient
,
that
two
to
one
be
odd
,
&
c.
,
discover
much
uneasiness
at
his
double
load
,
and
begin
to
consider
his
hinder
as
his
fore
leg
,
move
the
direct
contrary
way
to
that
which
be
call
forwards
.
<EOS>
nor
could
Joseph
,
with
all
his
horsemanship
,
persuade
him
to
advance
;
but
,
without
have
any
regard
to
the
lovely
part
of
the
lovely
girl
which
be
on
his
back
,
he
use
such
agitation
,
that

have
not
one
of
the
man
come
immediately
to
her
assistance
,
she
have
,
in
plain
English
,
tumble
backwards
on
the

<EOS>
this
inconvenience
be
presently
remedie
by
an
exchange
of
horse
;

then
Fanny
be
again
place
on
her
pillion
,
on
a
well

natured

somewhat
a
better

the

he
have
no

contend
with

agree
to
march

the
whole
procession
set
forwards
for
Booby

hall
,
where
they
arrive
in
a
few
hour
without
anything
remarkable

on

unless
it
be
a
curious
dialogue
between

to
use
the
language
of

"
wait

<EOS>
a
curious
dialogue
which
pass
between
Mr
Abraham
Adams
and
Mr
Peter
Pounce

better
worth
read
than
all

of
Colley

Pounce

I

Adams

if
I

<EOS>

Pounce

"
one
acre

for
my

I

no
delight

my
own

"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
you
can
indulge
yourself
with
many
fine

of

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
thank
God
<EOS>
I
have
a
little
,

reply
the
other
,
"
with
which
I
be
content
,
and
envy
no
man
:
<EOS>
I
have
a
little
,
Mr
Adams
,
with
which
I
do
as
much
good
as
I
can
.
"
<EOS>
Adams
answer
,
"
that
riche
without
charity
be
nothing
worth
;
for
that
they
be
a
blessing
only
to
him
who
make
them
a
blessing
to
other

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
and
I
,
"
say
Peter
,
"
have
different
notion
of
charity
.
<EOS>
I
own
,
as
it
be
generally
use
,
I
do
not
like
the
word
,
nor
do
I
think
it
become
one
of
us
gentleman
;
it
be
a
mean
parson
-
like
quality
;
though
I
would
not
infer
many
parson
<EOS>
have
it
neither
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
my
definition
of
charity
be
,
a
generous
disposition
to
relieve
the
distressed
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
something
in
that
definition
,
"
answer
Peter
,
"
which
I
like
well
enough
;
it
be
,
as
you
say
,
a
disposition
,
and
do
not
so
much
consist
in
the
act
as
in
the
disposition
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
Mr
Adams
,
who
be
mean
by
the
distressed
?
<EOS>
believe
me
,
the
distress
of
mankind
be
mostly
imaginary
,
and
it
would
be
rather
folly
than
goodness
to
relieve
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
sure
,
sir
,
"
reply
Adams
,
"
hunger
and
thirst
,
cold
and
nakedness
,
and
other
distress
which
attend
the
poor
,
can
never
be
say
to
be
imaginary
evil
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
can
any
man
complain
of
hunger
,
"
say
Peter
,
"
in
a
country
where
such
excellent
salad
be
to
be
gather
in
almost
every
field
?
<EOS>
or
of
thirst
,
where
every
river
and
stream
produce
such
delicious
potation
?
<EOS>
and
as
for
cold
and
nakedness
,
they
be
evil
introduce
by
luxury
and
custom
.
<EOS>
a
man
naturally
want
clothe
no
more
than
a
horse
or
any
other
animal
;
and
there
be
whole
nation
who
go
without
them
;
but
these
be
thing
perhaps
which
you
,
who
do
not
know
the
world
"
 
"
You
will
pardon
me
,
sir
,
"
return
Adams
;
"
I
have
read
of
the
gymnosophist
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
plague
of
your
jehosaphat
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Peter
;
"
the
great
fault
in
our
constitution
be
the
provision
make
for
the
poor
,
except
that
perhaps
make
for
some
other
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
have
not
an
estate
which
doth
not
contribute
almost
as
much
again
to
the
poor
as
to
the
land
-
tax
;
and
I
do
assure
you
I
expect
to
come
myself
to
the
parish
in
the
end
.
<EOS>
"
to
which
Adams
give
a
dissent
smile
,
Peter
thus
proceed
:
"
I
fancy
,
Mr
Adams
,
you
be
one
of
those
who
imagine
I
be
a
lump
of
money
;
for
there
be
many
who
,
I
fancy
,
believe
that
not
only
my
pocket
,
but
my
whole
clothe
,
be
line
with
bank
-
bill
;
but
I
assure
you
,
you
be
all
mistaken
;
I
be
not
the
man
the
world
esteem
me
.
<EOS>
if
I
can
hold
my
head
above
water
it
be
all
I
can
.
<EOS>
I
have
injure
myself
by
purchase
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
too
liberal
of
my
money
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
fear
my
heir
will
find
my
affair
in
a
bad
situation
than
they
be
repute
to
be
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
he
will
have
reason
to
wish
I
have
love
money
more
and
land
less
.
<EOS>
pray
,
my
good
neighbour
,
<EOS>
where
should
I
have
that
quantity
of
riches
the
world
be
so
liberal
to
bestow
on
me
?
<EOS>
where
could
I
possibly
,
without
I
have
steal
it
,
acquire
such
a
treasure
?
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
truly
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
I
have
be
always
of
your
opinion
;
I
have
wonder
as
well
as
yourself
with
what
confidence
they
could
report
such
thing
of
you
,
which
have
to
me
appear
as
mere
impossibility
;
for
you
know
,
sir
,
and
I
have
often
hear
you
say
it
,
that
your
wealth
be
of
your
own
acquisition
;
and
can
it
be
credible
that
in
your
short
time
you
should
have
amass
such
a
heap
of
treasure
as
these
people
will
have
you
worth
?
<EOS>
indeed
,
have
you
inherit
an
estate
like
Sir
Thomas
Booby
,
which
have
descend
in
your
family
for
many
generation
,
they
may
have
have
a
colour
for
their
assertion
.
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
what
do
they
say
I
be
worth
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Peter
,
with
a
malicious
sneer
.
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
answer
Adams
,
"
I
have
hear
some
aver
you
be
not
worth
less
than
twenty
thousand
pound
.
"
at
which
Peter
frown
.
"
Nay
,
sir
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
you
ask
me
only
the
opinion
of
other
;
for
my
own
part
,
I
have
always
deny
it
,
nor
do
I
ever
believe
you
could
possibly
be
worth
half
that
sum
.
"
<EOS>
"
however
,
Mr
Adams
,
"
say
he
,
squeeze
him
by
the
hand
,
"
I
would
not
sell
them
all
I
be
worth
for
double
that
sum
;
and
as
to
what
you
believe
,
or
they
believe
,
I
care
not
a
fig
,
no
not
a
fart
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
poor
because
you
think
me
so
,
nor
because
you
attempt
to
undervalue
me
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
envy
of
mankind
very
well
;
but
I
thank
Heaven
I
be
above
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
my
wealth
be
of
my
own
acquisition
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
an
estate
,
like
Sir
Thomas
Booby
<EOS>
,
that
have
descend
in
my
family
through
many
generation
;
but
I
know
heir
of
such
estate
who
be
force
to
travel
about
the
country
like
some
people
in
torn
cassock
,
and
may
be
glad
to
accept
of
a
pitiful
curacy
for
what
I
know
.
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
,
as
shabby
fellow
as
yourself
,
whom
no
man
of
my
figure
,
without
that
vice
of
good

nature
about
him
,
would
suffer
to
ride
in
a
chariot
with
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
I
value
not
your
chariot
of
a
rush
;
and
if
I
have
know
you
have
intend
to
affront
me

I
would
have
walk
to
the

end
on

<EOS>

how

Our

she
impute
that
to
his
youth
,
his
folly
,
his
awe
,
his
religion
,
to
everything
<EOS>
but
what
would
instantly
have
produce
contempt
,
want
of
passion
for
the
sex
,
or
that
which
would
have
rouse
her
hatred
,
want
of
like
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
reflection
then
hurry
her
farther
,
and
tell
her
she
must
see
this
beautiful
youth
no
more
;
nay
,
suggest
to
her
that
she
herself
have
dismiss
him
for
no
other
fault
than
probably
that
of
too
violent
an
awe
and
respect
for
herself
;
and
which
she
ought
rather
to
have
esteem
a
merit
,
the
effect
of
which
be
besides
so
easily
and
surely
to
have
be
remove
;
she
then
blame
,
she
curse
the
hasty
rashness
of
her
temper
;
her
fury
be
vent
all
on
herself
,
and
Joseph
appear
innocent
in
her
eye
.
<EOS>
Her
passion
at
length
grow
so
violent
,
that
it
force
her
on
seek
relief
,
and
now
she
think
of
recall
him
:
but
pride
forbad
that
;
pride
,
which
soon
drive
all
soft
passion
from
her
soul
,
and
represent
to
her
the
meanness
of
him
<EOS>
she
be
fond
of
.
<EOS>
that
thought
soon
begin
to
obscure
his
beauty
;
contempt
succeed
next
,
and
then
disdain
,
which
presently
introduce
her
hatred
of
the
creature
who
have
give
her
so
much
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
these
enemy
of
Joseph
have
no
sooner
take
possession
of
her
mind
than
they
insinuate
to
her
a
thousand
thing
in
his
disfavour
;
everything
but
dislike
of
her
person
;
a
thought
which
,
as
it
would
have
be
intolerable
to
bear
,
she
check
the
moment
it
endeavour
to
arise
.
<EOS>
revenge
come
now
to
her
assistance
;
and
she
consider
her
dismission
of
him
,
stript
,
and
without
a
character
,
with
the
utmost
pleasure
.
<EOS>
She
riot
in
the
several
kind
of
misery
which
her
imagination
suggest
to
her
may
be
his
fate
;
and
,
with
a
smile
compose
of
anger
,
mirth
,
and
scorn
,
view
him
in
the
rag
in
which
her
fancy
have
dr
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Slipslop
,
be
summon
,
attend
her
mistress

who
have
now
in
her
own
opinion
totally
subdue
this
passion

<EOS>
whilst

she
ask

<EOS>
Slipslop

she
have

"
and
how

"
<EOS>
truly

Slipslop

"
in
such
a
manner
that
infect
everybody
who
see
him
.
<EOS>
the
poor
lad
have
but
little
wage
to
receive
;
for
he
constantly
allow
his
father
and
mother
half
his
income
;
so
that
,
when
your
ladyship
's
livery
be
stript
off
,
he
have
not
wherewithal
to
buy
a
coat
,
and
must
have
go
naked
if
one
of
the
footman
have
not
incommodate
him
with
one
;
and
whilst
he
be
stand
in
his
shirt
(
and
,
to
say
truth
<EOS>
,
he
be
an
amorous
figure
)
,
be
tell
your
ladyship
would
not
give
him
a
character
,
he
sigh
,
and
say
he
have
do
nothing
willingly
to
offend
;
that
for
his
part
,
he
should
always
give
your
ladyship
a
good
character
wherever
he
go
;
and
he
pray
God
to
bless
you
;
for
you
be
the
good
of
lady
,
though
his
enemy
have
set
you
against
him
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
have
not
turn
him
away
;
for
I
believe
you
have
not
a
faithfuller
servant
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
come
you
then
,
"
reply
the
lady
,
"
to
advise
me
to
turn
him
away
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
,
madam
!
"
<EOS>
say
Slipslop
;
"
I
be
sure
you
will
do
me
the
justice
to
say
,
I
do
all
in
my
power
to
prevent
it
;
but
I
see
your
ladyship
be
angry
;
and
it
be
not
the
business
of
us
upper
servant
to
hinterfear
on
these
occasion
.
"
<EOS>
"
and
be
it
not
you
,
audacious
wretch
!
"
<EOS>
cry
the
lady
,
"
who
make
me
angry
?
<EOS>
be
it
not
your
tittle
-
tattle
,
in
which
I
believe
you
belye
the
poor
fellow
,
which
incense
me
against
him
?
<EOS>
He
may
thank
you
for
all
that
hath
happen
;
and
so
may
I
for
the
loss
of
a
good
servant
,
and
one
who
probably
have
more
merit
than
all
of
you
.
<EOS>
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
I
be
charm
with
his
goodness
to
his
parent
.
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
tell
me
of
that
,
but
suffer
me
to
dismiss
so
good
a
creature
without
a
character
?
<EOS>
I
see
the
reason
of
your
whole
behaviour
now
as
well
as
your
complaint
;
you
be
jealous
of
the
wench
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
jealous
!
"
say
Slipslop
;
"
I
assure
you
,
I
look
upon
myself
as
his
better
;
I
be
not
meat
for
a
footman
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
these
word
throw
the
lady
into
a
violent
passion
,
and
she
send
Slipslop
from
her
presence
,
who
depart
,
toss
her
nose
,
and
cry
,
"
marry
,
come
up
!
<EOS>
there
be
some
people
more
jealous
than
I
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
Her
lady
affect
not
to
hear
the
word
,
though
in
reality
she
do
,
and
understand
them
too
.
<EOS>
now
ensue
a
second
conflict
,
so
like
the
former
,
that
it
may
savour
of
repetition
to
relate
it
minutely
.
<EOS>
It
may
suffice
to
say
that
Lady
Booby
find
good
reason
to
doubt
whether
she
have
so
absolutely
conquer
her
passion
as
she
have
flatter
herself
;
and
,
in
order
to
accomplish
it
quite
,
take
a
resolution
,
more
common
than
wise
,
to
retire
immediately
into
the
country
.
<EOS>
the
reader
hath
long
ago
see
the
arrival
of
Mrs
Slipslop
,
whom
no
pertness
could
make
her
mistress
resolve
to
part
with
;
lately
,
that
of
Mr
Pounce
,
her
forerunner
;
and
,
lastly
,
that
of
the
lady
herself
.
  
<EOS>
the
morning
after
her
arrival
be
Sunday
,
she
go
to
church
,
to
the
great
surprize
of
everybody
,
who
wonder
to
see
her
ladyship
,
be
no
very
constant
church
-
woman
,
there
so
suddenly
upon
her
journey
.
<EOS>
Joseph
be
likewise
there
;
and
I
have
hear
it
be
remark
that
she
fix
her
eye
on
him
much
more
than
on
the
parson
;
but
this
I
believe
to
be
only
a
malicious
rumour
.
<EOS>
when
the
prayer
be
end
Mr
Adams
stand
up
,
and
with
a
loud
voice
pronounce
,
"
I
publish
the
banns
of
marriage
between
Joseph
Andrews
and
Frances
Goodwill
,
both
of
this
parish
,
"
&
c.
whether
this
have
any
effect
on
Lady
Booby
or
no
,
who
be
then
in
her
pew
,
which
the
congregation
could
not
see
into
,
I
could
never
discover
:
<EOS>
but
certain
it
be
that
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
stand
up
,
and
direct
her
eye
to
that
part
of
the
church
where
the
woman
sit
,
and
persist
in
look
that
way
during
the
remainder
of
the
sermon
in
so
scrutinize
a
manner
,
and
with
so
angry
a
countenance
,
that
most
of
the
woman
be
afraid
she
be
offend
at
them
.
<EOS>
the
moment
she
return
home
she
send
for
Slipslop
into
her
chamber
,
and
tell
her
she
wonder
what
that
impudent
fellow
Joseph
do
in
that
parish
?
<EOS>
upon
which
Slipslop
give
her
an
account
of
her
meeting
Adams
with
him
on
the
road
,
and
likewise
the
adventure
with
Fanny
.
<EOS>
at
the
relation
of
which
the
lady
often
change
her
countenance
;
and
when
she
have
hear
all
,
she
order
Mr
Adams
into
her
presence
,
to
whom
she
behave
as
the
reader
will
see
in
the
next
chapter
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
a
dialogue
between
Mr
Abraham
Adams
and
the
Lady
Booby
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Adams
be
not
far
off
,
for
he
be
drink
her
ladyship
's
health
below
in
a
cup
of
her
ale
.
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
come
before
her
than
she
begin
in
the
follow
manner
:
"
I
wonder
,
sir
,
after
the
many
great
obligation
you
have
have
to
this
family
"
(
with
all
which
the
reader
hath
in
the
course
of
this
history
be
minutely
acquaint
)
,
"
that
you
will
ungratefully
show
any
respect
to
a
fellow
who
hath
be
turn
out
of
it
for
his
misdeed
.
<EOS>
nor
doth
it
,
I
can
tell
you
,
sir
,
become
a
man
of
your
character
,
to
run
about
the
country
with
an
idle
fellow
and
wench
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
as
for
the
girl
,
I
know
no
harm
of
her
.
<EOS>
slipslop
tell
me
she
be
formerly
breed
up
in
my
house
,
and
behave
as
she
ought
,
till
she
hanker
after
this
fellow
,
and
he
spoil
her
.
<EOS>
nay
,
she
may
still
,
perhaps
,
do
very
well
,
if
he
will
let
her
alone
.
<EOS>
You
be
,
therefore
,
do
a
monstrous
thing
in
endeavour
to
procure
a
match
between
these
two
people
,
which
will
be
to
the
ruin
of
them
both
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
say
Adams
,
"
<EOS>
if
your
ladyship
will
but
hear
me
speak
,
I
protest
I
never
hear
any
harm
of
Mr
Joseph
Andrews
;
if
I
have
,
I
should
have
correct
him
for
it
;
for
I
never
have
,
nor
will
,
encourage
the
fault
of
those
under
my
care
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
young
woman
,
I
assure
your
ladyship
I
have
as
good
an
opinion
of
her
as
your
ladyship
<EOS>
yourself
or
any
other
can
have
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
sweetest
-
temper
,
honest
,
worthy
young
creature
;
indeed
,
as
to
her
beauty
,
I
do
not
commend
her
on
that
account
,
though
all
man
allow
she
be
the
handsome
woman
,
gentle
or
simple
,
that
ever
appear
in
the
parish
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
impertinent
,
"
say
she
,
"
to
talk
such
fulsome
stuff
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
mighty
become
truly
in
a
clergyman
to
trouble
himself
about
handsome
woman
,
and
you
be
a
delicate
judge
of
beauty
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
a
man
who
hath
live
all
his
life
in
such
a
parish
as
this
be
a
rare
judge
of
beauty
!
<EOS>
ridiculous
!
<EOS>
beauty
indeed
!
<EOS>
a
country
wench
a
beauty
!
<EOS>
I
shall
be
sick
whenever
I
hear
beauty
mention
again
.
<EOS>
and
so
this
wench
be
to
stock
the
parish
with
beauty
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
but
,
sir
,
our
poor
be
numerous
enough
already
;
I
will
have
no
more
vagabond
settle
here

Madam

Adams

your

without

<EOS>
this
couple
be
desirous

consummate
long
ago

I
dissuade
them
from
it

<EOS>
nay
,
I
may
venture
to
say
,
I
believe
I
be

it

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

well

you

the

demean
myself
to

long

I
shall
take
other
measure

I

you

I
shall
give
order

Madam

Adams

I

I

assure
,
when
you

enquire
farther
into

you
will
applaud

my

<EOS>
what
pass
between
the
lady
and
lawyer
Scout
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
the
lady
send
for
Mr
Scout
,
whom
she
attack
most
violently
for
intermeddle
with
her
servant
,
which
he
deny
,
and
indeed
with
truth
,
for
he
have
only
assert
accidentally
,
and
perhaps
rightly
,
that
a
year
's
service
gain
a
settlement
;
and
so
far
he
own
he
may
have
formerly
inform
the
parson
and
believe
it
be
law
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
resolve
,
"
say
the
lady
,
"
to
have
no
discard
servant
of
mine
settle
here
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
if
this
be
your
law
,
I
shall
send
to
another
lawyer
.

"
<EOS>
Scout
say
,
"
if
she
send
to
a
hundred
lawyer
,
not
one
or
all
of
them
could
alter
the
law
.
<EOS>
the
utmost
that
be
in
the
power
of
a
lawyer
be
to
prevent
the
law
's
take
effect
;
and
that
he
himself
could
do
for
her
ladyship
as
well
as
any
other
;
and
I
believe
,
"
say
he
,
"
madam
,
your
ladyship
,
not
be
conversant
in
these
matter
,
hath
mistake
a
difference
;
for
I
assert
only
that
a
man
who
serve
a
year
be
settle
.
<EOS>
now
there
be
a
material
difference
between
be
settle
in
law
and
settle
in
fact
;
and
as
I
affirm
generally
he
be
settle
,
and
law
be
preferable
to
fact
,
my
settlement
must
be
understand
in
law
and
not
in
fact
.
<EOS>
and
suppose
,
madam
,
we
admit
he
be
settle
in
law
,
what
use
will
they
make
of
it
?
<EOS>
how
doth
that
relate
to
fact
?
<EOS>
He
be
not
settle
in
fact
;
and
if
he
be
not
settle
in
fact
,
he
be
not
an
inhabitant
;
and
if
he
be
not
an
inhabitant
,
he
be
not
of
this
parish
;
and
then
undoubtedly
he
ought
not
to
be
publish
here
;
for
Mr
Adams
hath
tell
me
your
ladyship
's
pleasure
,
and
the
reason
,
which
be
a
very
good
one
,
to
prevent
burden
us
with
the
poor
;
we
have
too
many
already
,
and
I
think
we
ought
to
have
an
act
to
hang
or
transport
half
of
them
.
<EOS>
if
we
can
prove
in
evidence
that
he
be
not
settle
in
fact

it
be
another
matter
.
<EOS>
what
I
say
to
Mr
Adams
be
on
a
supposition
that
he
be
settle
in
fact
;
and
indeed
,
if
that
be
the
case
,
I
should
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
tell
me
your
fact

your
ifs

say
the
lady

"
I
do
not
understand
your
gibberish
;
you
take
too
much
upon
you

be
very
impertinent

in
this

you

better

I
assure
you
,
you
shall

<EOS>
but
as
to
the
wench

I
be
resolve
she

I
will
not

such
beauty

Mr

it

Mr

well

,
dear
Mr

let
her
be
what
she
will

these
ugly

bring
child

you
know

so
that
we
must
prevent

<EOS>
"
true
,
madam
,
"
reply
Scout
,
"
for
the
subsequent
marriage
co
-
operating
with
the
law
will
carry
law
into
fact

<EOS>
when
a
man
be
married
he
be
settle
in
fact

and
then
he
be
not
removable

<EOS>
I
will
see
Mr
Adams
,
and
I
make
no
doubt
of
prevail
with
him
.
<EOS>
His
only
objection
be
,
doubtless
,
that
he
shall
lose
his
fee
;
but
that
be
once
make
easy
,
as
it
shall
be
,
I
be
confident
no
farther
objection
will
remain

<EOS>
no
,
no
,
it
be
impossible
;
but
your
ladyship
can
not
discommend
his
unwillingness

depart
from
his
fee

<EOS>
every
man
ought
to
have
a
proper
value
for
his
fee

<EOS>
as
to
the
matter
in
question
,
if
your

please
to
employ
me
in
it
,
I
will
venture
to
promise
you
success

<EOS>
the
law
of
this
land
be
not
so
vulgar
to
permit
a
mean
fellow
to
contend
with
one
of
your
ladyship
's
fortune
.
<EOS>
We
have
one
sure
card
,
which
be
,
to
carry
him
before
Justice
Frolick
,
who
,
upon
hear
your

will
commit
him
without
any
farther
question

<EOS>
as
for
the
dirty
slut

we
shall
have
nothing
to
do
with
her

for
,
if
we
get
rid
of
the
fellow

the
ugly
jade
will

take
what
measure
you

good
Mr
Scout

answer
the
lady
:
"
<EOS>
but
I
wish
you
could
rid
the
parish
of
both
;
for
Slipslop
tell
me
such
story
of

wench

that
I
abhor
the
thought

,
though
you
say
she
be
such
an
ugly
slut

yet
you
know

dear
Mr

these
forward

always

<EOS>
"
Your
ladyship
be
very
much
in
the
right

answer
Scout
;

but
I
be
afraid
the
law
be
a
little
deficient
in
give
us
any
such
power

prevention

however

the
justice
will
stretch
it
as
far

<EOS>
to
say
truth

it
be
a
great
blessing
to
the
country
that
he
be
in
the
commission

for
he
hath
take
several
poor
off
our
hand
that
the
law
would
never
lay
hold
on

I
know
some
justice

think
as
much
of
commit
a
man
to
Bridewell
as
his
lordship
at

size
would
of
hang
him

it
would
do
a
man
good

see
his
worship

commit
a
fellow
to
Bridewell

he
take
so
much
pleasure

it

when
once

we
seldom

any
more

<EOS>
here
the
arrival
of
a
visitor
put
an
end
to
the
conversation

and
Mr
Scout
,
have
undertake
the
cause
and
promise

this
Scout

one
of
those
fellow
who
,
without
any
knowledge
of

in
defiance

be
the
pest

a
scandal
to
a
profession

to

indeed
they

whom
a
little
before

would
not
have
condescend
to
have
speak

do
a
certain
passion
for
Joseph

the
jealousy

the
disdain
of
poor
innocent
Fanny

the
Lady
Booby
into
a
familiar
discourse

she
inadvertently
confirm
many
hint
with
which
Slipslop

severe
falsehood

<EOS>
a
short
chapter
,
but
very
full
of
matter
;
particularly
the
arrival
of
Mr
Booby
and
his
lady
.
  
<EOS>
all
that
night
,
and
the
next
day
,
the
Lady
Booby
past
with
the
utmost
anxiety
;
her
mind
be
distract
and
her
soul
toss
up
and
down
by
many
turbulent
and
opposite
passion
.
<EOS>
She
love
,
hate
,
pity
,
scorn
,
admire
,
despise
the
same
person
by
fit
,
which
change
in
a
very
short
interval
.
<EOS>
on
Tuesday
morning
,
which
happen
to
be
a
holiday
,
she
go
to
church
,
where
,
to
her
surprize
,
Mr
Adams
publish
the
banns
again
with
as
audible
a
voice
as
before
.
<EOS>
It
be
lucky
for
her
that
,
as
there
be
no
sermon
,
she
have
an
immediate
opportunity
of
return
home
to
vent
her
rage
,
which
she
could
not
have
conceal
from
the
congregation
five
minute
;
indeed
,
it
be
not
then
very
numerous
,
the
assembly
consist
of
no
more
than
Adams
,
his
clerk
,
his
wife
,
the
lady
,
and
one
of
her
servant
.
<EOS>
at
her
return
she
meet
Slipslop
,
who
accost
her
in
these
word
:
 
"
o
meam
,
what
doth
your
ladyship
think
?
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
lawyer
Scout
hath
carry
Joseph
and
Fanny
both
before
the
justice
.
<EOS>
all
the
parish
be
in
tear
,
and
say
they
will
certainly
be
hang
;
for
nobody
know
what
it
be
for
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
they
deserve
it
,
"
say
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
dost
<EOS>
thou
mention
such
wretch
to
me
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
o
dear
madam
,
"
answer
Slipslop
,
"
be
it
not
a
pity
such
a
graceless
young
man
should
die
a
virulent
death
?
<EOS>
I
hope
the
judge
will
take
commensuration
on
his
youth
.
<EOS>
as
for
Fanny
,
I
do
not
think
it
signify
much
what
become
of
her
;
and
if
poor
Joseph
hath
do
anything
,
I
could
venture
to
swear
she
traduce
him
to
it
<EOS>
:
few
man
ever
come
to
a
fragrant
punishment
,
but
by
those
nasty
creature
,
who
be
a
scandal
to
our
sect
.
<EOS>
"
the
lady
be
no
more
pleased
at
this
news
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
,
than
Slipslop
herself
;
for
,
though
she
wish
Fanny
far
enough
,
she
do
not
desire
the
removal
of
Joseph
,
especially
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
puzzle
how
to
act
or
what
to
say
on
this
occasion
,
when
a
coach
and
six
drive
into
the
court
,
and
a
servant
acquaint
her
with
the
arrival
of
her
nephew
Booby
and
his
lady
.
<EOS>
She
order
them
to
be
conduct
into
a
drawing
-
room
,
whither
she
presently
repair
,
have
compose
her
countenance
as
well
as
she
could
,
and
be
a
little
satisfied
that
the
wedding
would
by
these
mean
be
at
least
interrupted
,
and
that
she
should
have
an
opportunity
to
execute
any
resolution
she
may
take
,
for
which
she
see
herself
provide
with
an
excellent
instrument
in
Scout
.
  
<EOS>
the
Lady
Booby
apprehend
her
servant
have
make
a
mistake
when
he
mention
Mr
Booby
's
lady
;
for
she
have
never
hear
of
his
marriage
:
but
how
great
be
her
surprize
when
,
at
her
enter
the
room
,
her
nephew
present
his
wife
to
her
;
say
,
"
Madam
,
this
be
that
charm
Pamela
,
of
whom
I
be
convinced
you
have
hear
so
much
.
<EOS>
"
the
lady
receive
her
with
more
civility
than
he
expect
;
indeed
with
the
utmost
;
for
she
be
perfectly
polite
,
nor
have
any
vice
inconsistent
with
good
-
breeding
.
<EOS>
They
past
some
little
time
in
ordinary
discourse
,
when
a
servant
come
and
whisper
Mr
Booby
,
who
presently
tell
the
lady
he
must
desert
them
a
little
on
some
business
of
consequence
;
and
,
as
their
discourse
during
his
absence
would
afford
little
improvement
or
entertainment
to
the
reader
,
we
will
leave
them
for
a
while
to
attend
Mr
Booby

contain
justice

curious
precedent
of
deposition

and
other
matter
necessary
to
be
peruse
by
all

<EOS>
the
young
squire
and
his
lady
be
no
sooner
alighted
from
their
coach
than
the
servant
begin
to
inquire
after
Mr

to
her
great
surprize

since

upon
this
they
be

with
which
they
hastily
acquaint
their
master

who
take
an

resolution
to
go

where
he

It

and
as
this
suit

which
be
rather
too
large

exactly
fit

so
he
become

so
well

look
so
genteel

that
no

would
have
doubt
its
being
as
well

Joseph
beg
that
he
may
see

Joseph
immediately
comply

addition
of

<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
Joseph
,
at
their
request
,
entertain
them
with
an
account
of
his
adventure
:
nor
could
Lady
Booby
conceal
her
dissatisfaction
at
those
part
in
which
Fanny
be
concern
,
especially
when
Mr
Booby
launch
forth
into
such
rapturous
praise
of
her
beauty
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
apply
to
her
niece
,
that
she
wonder
her
nephew
,
who
have
pretend
to
marry
for
love
,
should
think
such
a
subject
proper
to
amuse
his
wife
with
;
add
,
that
,
for
her
part
,
she
should
be
jealous
of
a
husband
who
speak
so
warmly
in
praise
of
another
woman
.
<EOS>
Pamela
answer
,
indeed
,
she
think
she
have
cause
;
but
it
be
an
instance
of
Mr
Booby
's
aptness
to
see
more
beauty
in
woman
than
they
be
mistress
of
.
<EOS>
at
which
word
both
the
woman
fix
their
eye
on
two
looking
-
glass
;
and
Lady
Booby
reply
,
that
man
be
,
in
the
general
,
very
ill
judge
of
beauty
;
and
then
,
whilst
both
contemplate
only
their
own
face
,
they
pay
a
cross
compliment
to
each
other
's
charm
.
<EOS>
when
the
hour
of
rest
approach
,
which
the
lady
of
the
house
defer
as
long
as
decently
she
could
,
she
inform
Joseph
(
whom
for
the
future
we
shall
call
Mr
Joseph
,
he
have
as
good
a
title
to
that
appellation
as
many
other
 
<EOS>
I

that
she

<EOS>
He

favour
to
his

for

but
she

,
alledge
that

such
a

the
thought
of
her
love
keep
her
waking
,
and
his
not

accord
to
his
promise
fill
her
with
uneasiness
;
of
which
,
however
,
she
could
not
assign
any
other
cause

<EOS>
Mr
Joseph
rise
early
in
the
morning
,
and
visit
her
in
whom
his
soul

<EOS>
She

his
voice
in
the
parson

parlour
than
she
leapt
from
her

and
,
dress
herself
in
a

minute

<EOS>
They
pass
two
hour
with
inexpressible
happiness
together
;
and
then
,
have
appoint
Monday

by
Mr
Adams
's
permission
,
for
their

,
Mr
Joseph
return
,
accord
to
his

,
to
breakfast
at
the
Lady
Booby
's
,
with
whose
behaviour
,
since
the
evening
,
we
shall
now
acquaint
the
reader
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
no
sooner
retire
to
her
chamber
than
she
ask
Slipslop
<EOS>
"
what
she
think
of
this
wonderful
creature
her
nephew
have
marry
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
?
<EOS>
"
say
Slipslop
,
not
yet
sufficiently
understand
what
answer
<EOS>
she
be
to
make
.
<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
,
"
answer
the
lady
,
"
what
you
think
of
the
dowdy
,
my
niece
,
I
think
I
be
to
call
her
?
"
<EOS>
slipslop
,
want
no
further
hint
,
begin
to
pull
her
to
piece
,
and
so
miserably
deface
her
,
that
it
would
have
be
impossible
for
any
one
to
have
know
the
person
.
<EOS>
the
lady
give
her
all
the
assistance
she
could
,
and
end
with
say
,
"
I
think
,
Slipslop
,
you
have
do
her
justice
;
but
yet
,
bad
as
she
be
,
she
be
an
angel
compare
to
this
Fanny
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Slipslop
then
fall
on
Fanny
,
whom
she
hack
and
hew
in
the
like
barbarous
manner
,
conclude
with
an
observation
that
there
be
always
something
in
those
low
-
life
creature
which
must
eternally
extinguish
them
from
their
better
.
"
<EOS>
really
,
"
say
the
lady
,
"
I
think
there
be
one
exception
to
your
rule
;
I
be
certain
you
may
guess
who
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
I
,
upon
my
word
,
madam
,
"
say
Slipslop
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
a
young
fellow
;
sure
you
be
the
dull
wretch
,
"
say
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
o
la
!
<EOS>
I
be
indeed
.
<EOS>
yes
,
truly
,
madam
,
he
be
an
accession
,
"
answer
Slipslop
.
<EOS>
"
ay
,
be
he
not
,
Slipslop
?
"
return
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
be
he
not
so
genteel
that
a
prince
may
,
without
a
blush
,
acknowledge
him
for
his
son
?
<EOS>
His
behaviour
be
such
that
would
not
shame
the
good
education
.
<EOS>
He
borrow
from
his
station
a
condescension
in
everything
to
his
superior
,
yet
unattende
by
that
mean
servility
which
be
call
good
behaviour
in
such
person
.
<EOS>
everything
he
doth
hath
<EOS>
no
mark
of
the
base
motive
of
fear
,
but
visibly
show
some
respect
and
gratitude
,
and
carry
with
it
the
persuasion
of
love
.
<EOS>
and
then
for
his
virtue
:
such
piety
to
his
parent
,
such
tender
affection
to
his
sister
,
such
integrity
in
his
friendship
,
such
bravery
,
such
goodness
,
that
,
if
he
have
be
bear
a
gentleman
,
his
wife
would
have
possess
the
most
invaluable
blessing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
,
madam
,
"
say
Slipslop
.
<EOS>
"
but
as
he
be
,
"
answer
the
lady
,
"
if
he
have
a
thousand
more
good
quality
,
it
must
render
a
woman
of
fashion
contemptible
even
to
be
suspect
of
think
of
him
;
yes
,
I
should
despise
myself
for
such
a
thought
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
to
be
sure
,
madam
,
"
say
Slipslop
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
why
to
be
sure
?
<EOS>
"
reply
the
lady
;
"
thou
art
always
one
's
echo

<EOS>
be
he
not
more
worthy
of
affection
than
a
dirty
country
clown
,
though
bear
of
a
family
as
old
as
the
flood
?
<EOS>
or
an
idle
worthless
rake
,
or
little
puisny
beau
of
quality
?
<EOS>
and
yet
these
we
must
condemn
ourselves
to
,
in
order
to
avoid
the
censure
of
the
world
;
to
shun
the
contempt
of
other
,
we
must
ally
ourselves
to
those
we
despise
;
we
must
prefer
birth
,
title
,
and
fortune
,
to
real
merit
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
tyranny
of
custom
,
a
tyranny
we
must
comply
with
;
for
we
people
of
fashion
be
the
slave
of
custom

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
marry
come
up

"

Slipslop

who
now
know
well
which
party
to
take

<EOS>
"
if
I

I

Me

the

I
be

the

"
<EOS>
Thou
art
always
ready

answer
before
thou
hast

one

so
far
I
must
allow

Me

no

Slipslop

all

I
have
lose
a
husband
who
 
<EOS>
but
if
I
should
reflect
I
should
run
mad

<EOS>
My
future
ease
must
depend
upon
forgetfulness

<EOS>
slipslop
,
let
me
hear
some
of
thy
nonsense
,
to
turn
my
thought
another
way
.
<EOS>
what
dost
thou
think
of
Mr
Andrews
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
think
,
"
say
Slipslop
,
"
he
be
the
handsome
,
most
proper
man
I
ever
see
;
and
if
I
be
a
lady
of
the
great
degree
it
would
be
well
for
some
folk
.
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
may
talk
of
custom
,
if
you
please
:
but
I
be
confidous
there
be
no
more
comparison
between
young
Mr
Andrews
and
most
of
the
young
gentleman
who
come
to
your
ladyship
's
house
in
London
;
a
parcel
of
whipper
-
snapper
spark
:
I
would
sooner
marry
our
old
parson
Adams

<EOS>
never
tell
me
what
people
say
,
whilst
I
be
happy
in
the
arm
of
him
I
love
.
<EOS>
some
folk
rail
against
other
folk
because
other
folk
have
what
some
folk
would
be
glad
of
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
,
"
answer
the
lady
,
"
if
you
be
a
woman
of
condition
,
you
would
really
marry
Mr
Andrews
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
assure
your

Slipslop

"
if

would
have
me

<EOS>
"
fool
,
idiot
!

<EOS>
cry
the
lady
;

would

<EOS>
be
that
a
question

"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
truly
,
madam

"

Slipslop
,
"
I
believe
it
would
be
none
if
Fanny
be
out
of

way

I
be
confidous
,
if
I
be
in
your

's
place
,
and
like
Mr
Joseph
Andrews
,
she
should
not
stay
in
the
parish
a
moment

<EOS>
I
be
sure
lawyer
Scout
would
send
her
packing
if
your

would
but
say
the
word
.
<EOS>
"
this
last
speech
of
Slipslop
raise
a
temp
in
the
mind
of
her
mistress
.
<EOS>
She
fear
Scout
have
betray
her
,
or
rather
that
she
have
betray
herself
.
<EOS>
after
some
silence
,
and
a
double
change
of
her
complexion
,
first
to
pale
and
then
to
red
,
she
thus
speak
:
"
I
be
astonish
at
the
liberty
you
give
your
tongue

<EOS>
Would
you
insinuate
that
I
employ
Scout
against
this
wench

account
of
the
fellow

"
 
<EOS>
"
La

Slipslop

fright
out
of

I
assassinate
such
a
thing

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
dare
not

answer
the
lady
;
"
I
believe
my
conduct
may
defy
malice
itself

assert
so
curse
a

I

<EOS>
to

accuse

not

of

I

so
much
beneath

<EOS>
"
upon

Slipslop

those

thy
coarse

<EOS>
Thou
art
<EOS>
a
low
creature

of

<EOS>
"
I
assure
your

,
"
say
Slipslop
,
whose
passion
be
almost
of
as
high
an
order
as
her
lady

,
"
<EOS>
I
have
no
more
to
do
with
Common
Garden
than
other
folk
.
<EOS>
really
,
your
ladyship
talk
of
servant
as
if
they
be
not
bear
of
the
christian
specious
.
<EOS>
servant
have
flesh
and
blood
as
well
as
quality
;
and
Mr
Andrews
himself
be
a
proof
that
they
have
as
good
,
if
not
well
.
<EOS>
and
for
my
own
part
,
I
can
not
perceive
my
dears[A
]
be
coarse
than
other
people
's
;
and
I
be
sure
,
if
Mr
Andrews
be
a
dear
of
mine
,
I
should
not
be
ashamed
of
him
in
company
with
gentleman
;
for
whoever
hath
see
him
in
his
new
clothe
must
confess
he
look
as
much
like
a
gentleman
as
anybody

<EOS>
coarse
,
quotha
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
to
hear
the
poor
young
fellow
run
down
neither
;
for
I
will
say
this
<EOS>
,
I
never
hear
him
say
an
ill
word
of
anybody
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
his
coarseness
doth
not
lie
in
his
heart
,
for
he
be
the
best
-
natured
man
in
the
world
;
and
as
for
his
skin
,
it
be
no
coarser
than
other
people
's
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
His
bosom
,
when
a
boy
,
be
as
white
as
drive
snow
;
and
,
where
it
be
not
cover
with

,
be
so
still

<EOS>
ifakin
!
<EOS>
if
I
be
Mrs
Andrews
,
with
a
hundred
a
year
,
I
should
not
envy
the
good
she
who
wear
a
head

<EOS>
a
woman
that
could
not
be
happy
with
such
a
man
ought
never

so

for
if
he
can
not
make
a
woman
happy

I
never
yet
beheld
the
man
who
could

<EOS>
I
say
again
<EOS>
,
I
wish
I
be
a
great
lady
for
his

when
I

Mr
Booby
's
grave
advice
to
Joseph
,
and
Fanny
's
encounter
with
a
beau
.
  
<EOS>
Habit
,
my
good
reader
,
hath
so
vast
a
prevalence
over
the
human
mind
,
that
there
be
scarce
anything
too
strange
or
too
strong
to
be
assert
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
story
of
the
miser
,
who
,
from
long
accustom
to
cheat
other
,
come
at
last
to
cheat
himself
,
and
with
great
delight
and
triumph
pick
his
own
pocket
of
a
guinea
to
convey
to
his
hoard
,
be
not
impossible
or
improbable
.
<EOS>
in
like
manner
it
fare
with
the
practiser
of
deceit
,
who
,
from
have
long
deceive
their
acquaintance
,
gain
at
last
a
power
of
deceive
themselves
,
and
acquire
that
very
opinion
(
however
false
)
of
their
own
ability
,
excellency
,
and
virtue
,
into
which
they
have
for
year
perhaps
endeavour
to
betray
their
neighbour
.
<EOS>
now
,
reader
,
to
apply
this
observation
to
my
present
purpose
,
thou
must
know
,
that
as
the
passion
generally
call
love
exercise
most
of
the
talent
of
the
female
or
fair
world
,
so
in
this
they
now
and
then
discover
a
small
inclination
to
deceit
;
for
which
thou
wilt
not
be
angry
with
the
beautiful
creature
when
thou
hast
consider
that
at
the
age
of
seven
,
or
something
earlier
,
miss
be
instruct
by
her
mother
that
master
be
a
very
monstrous
kind
of
animal
,
who
will
,
if
she
suffer
him
to
come
too
near
her
,
infallibly
eat
her
up
and
grind
her
to
piece
:
that
,
so
far
from
kiss
or
toy
with
him
of
her
own
accord
,
she
must
not
admit
him
to
kiss
or
toy
with
her
:
and
,
lastly
,
that
she
must
never
have
any
affection
towards
him
;
for
if
she
should
,
all
her
friend
in
petticoat
would
esteem
her
a
traitress
,
point
at
her
,
and
hunt
her
out
of
their
society
.
<EOS>
these
impression
,
be
first
receive
,
be
farth
and
deeper
inculcate
by
their
school
-
mistress
and
companion
;
so
that
by
the
age
of
ten
they
have
contract
such
a
dread
and
abhorrence
of
the
above
-
name
monster
,
<EOS>
that
whenever
they
see
him
they
fly
from
him
as
the
innocent
hare
doth
from
the
greyhound
.
<EOS>
hence
,
to
the
age
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
,
they
entertain
a
mighty
antipathy
to
master
;
they
resolve
,
and
frequently
profess
,
that
they
will
never
have
any
commerce
with
him
,
and
entertain
fond
hope
of
pass
their
life
out
of
his
reach
,
of
the
possibility
of
which
they
have
so
visible
an
example
in
their
good
maiden
aunt
.
<EOS>
but
when
they
arrive
at
this
period
,
and
have
now
pass
their
second
climacteric
,
when
their
wisdom
,
grow
riper
,
begin
to
see
a
little
farther
,
and
,
from
almost
daily
fall
in
master
's
way
,
to
apprehend
the
great
difficulty
of
keep
out
of
it
;
and
when
they
observe
him
look
often
at
them
,
and
sometimes
very
eagerly
and
earnestly
too
(
for
the
monster
seldom
take
any
notice
of
them
till
at
this
age
)
,
they
then
begin
to
think
of
their
danger
;
and
,
as
they
perceive
they
can
not
easily
avoid
him
,
the
wise
part
bethink
themselves
of
provide
by
other
mean
for
their
security
.
<EOS>
They
endeavour
,
by
all
method
they
can
invent
,
to
render
themselves
so
amiable
in
his
eye
,
that
he
may
have
no
inclination
to
hurt
them
;
in
which
they
generally
succeed
so
well
,
that
his
eye
,
by
frequent
languishing
,
soon
lessen
their
idea
of
his
fierceness
,
and
so
far
abate
their
fear
,
that
they
venture
to
parley
with
him
;
and
when
they
perceive
him
so
different
from
what
he
hath
be
describe
,
all
gentleness
,
softness
,
kindness
,
tenderness
,
fondness
,
their
dreadful
apprehension
vanish
in
a
moment
;
and
now
(
it
be
usual
with
the
human
mind
to
skip
from
one
extreme
to
its
opposite
,
as
easily
,
and
almost
as
suddenly
,
as
a
bird
from
one
bough
to
another
)
love
instantly
succeed
to
fear
:
<EOS>
but
,
as
it
happen
to
person
who
have
in
their
infancy
be
thoroughly
frightened
with
certain
no
-
person
call
ghost
,
that
they
retain
their
dread
of
those
being
after
they
be
convinced
that
there
be
no
such
thing
,
so
<EOS>
these
young
lady
,
though
they
no
longer
apprehend
devour
,
can
not
so
entirely
shake
off
all
that
hath
be
instill
into
them
;
they
still
entertain
the
idea
of
that
censure
which
be
so
strongly
imprinted
on
their
tender
mind
,
to
which
the
declaration
of
abhorrence
they
every
day
hear
from
their
companion
greatly
contribute
.
<EOS>
to
avoid
this
censure
,
therefore
,
be
now
their
only
care
;
for
which
purpose
they
still
pretend
the
same
aversion
to
the
monster
:
and
the
more
they
love
him
,
the
more
ardently
they
counterfeit
the
antipathy
.
<EOS>
by
the
continual
and
constant
practice
of
which
deceit
on
other
,
they
at
length
impose
on
themselves
,
and
really
believe
they
hate
what
they
love
.
<EOS>
thus
,
indeed
,
it
happen
to
Lady
Booby
,
who
love
Joseph
long
before
she
know
it
;
and
now
love
him
much
more
than
she
suspect
.
<EOS>
She
have
indeed
,
from
the
time
of
his
sister
's
arrival
in
the
quality
of
her
niece
,
and
from
the
instant
she
view
him
in
the
dress
and
character
of
a
gentleman
,
begin
to
conceive
secretly
a
design
which
love
have
conceal
from
herself
till
a
dream
betray
it
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
no
sooner
rise
than
she
send
for
her
nephew
.
<EOS>
when
he
come
to
her
,
after
many
compliment
on
his
choice
,
she
tell
him
,
"
He
may
perceive
,
in
her
condescension
to
admit
her
own
servant
to
her
table
,
that
she
look
on
the
family
of
Andrews
as
his
relation
,
and
indeed
her
;
that
,
as
he
have
marry
into
such
a
family
,
it
become
him
to
endeavour
by
all
method
to
raise
it
as
much
as
possible
.
<EOS>
at
length
she
advise
him
to
use
all
his
heart
to
dissuade
Joseph
from
his
intended
match
,
which
would
still
enlarge
their
relation
to
meanness
and
poverty
;
conclude
that
,
by
a
commission
in
the
army
,
or
some
other
genteel
employment
,
he
may
soon
put
young
Mr
Andrews
on
the
foot
of
a
gentleman
;
and
,
that
be
once
do
,
his
accomplishment
may
quickly
gain
him
an
alliance
which
would
not
be
to
their
discredit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
nephew
heartily
embrace
this
proposal
,
and
,
find
Mr
Joseph
with
his
wife
,
at
his
return
to
her
chamber
,
he
immediately
begin
thus
:
"
My
love
to
my
dear
Pamela
,
brother
,
will
extend
to
all
her
relation
;
nor
shall
I
show
them
less
respect
than
if
I
have
marry
into
the
family
of
a
duke
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
give
you
some
early
testimony
of
this
,
and
shall
continue
to
give
you
daily
more
.
<EOS>
You
will
excuse
me
therefore
,
brother
,
if
my
concern
for
your
interest
make
me
mention
what
may
be
,
perhaps
,
disagreeable
to
you
to
hear
:
but
I
must
insist
upon
it
,
that
,
if
you
have
any
value
for
my
alliance
or
my
friendship
,
you
will
decline
any
thought
of
engage
farther
with
a
girl
who
be
,
as
you
be
a
relation
of
mine
,
so
much
beneath
you
.
<EOS>
I
know
there
may
be
at
first
some
difficulty
in
your
compliance
,
but
that
will
daily
diminish
;
and
you
will
in
the
end
sincerely
thank
me
for
my
advice
.
<EOS>
I
own
,
indeed
,
the
girl
be
handsome
;
but
beauty
alone
be
a
poor
ingredient
,
and
will
make
but
an
uncomfortable
marriage
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
Joseph
,
"
I
assure
you
her
beauty
be
her
least
perfection
;
nor
do
I
know
a
virtue
which
that
young
creature
be
not
possesst
of
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
as
to
her
virtue
,
"
answer
Mr
Booby
,
"
you
can
be
yet
<EOS>
but
a
slend
judge
of
them
;
<EOS>
but
,
if
she
have
never
so
many
,
you
will
find
her
equal
in
these
among
her
superior
in
birth
and
fortune
,
which
now
you
be
to
esteem
on
a
footing
with
yourself
;
at
least
I
will
take
care
<EOS>
they
shall
shortly
be
so
,
unless
you
prevent
me
by
degrade
yourself
with
such
a
match
,
a
match
I
have
hardly
patience
to
think
of
,
and
which
would
break
the
heart
of
your
parent
,
who
now
rejoice
in
the
expectation
of
see
you
make
a
figure
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
,
"
reply
Joseph
,
"
that
my
parent
have
any
power
over
my
inclination
;
nor
be
I
oblige
to
sacrifice
my
happiness
to
their
whim
or
ambition
:
<EOS>
besides
,
I
shall
be
very
sorry
to
see
that
the
unexpected
advancement
of
my
sister
should
so
suddenly
inspire
them
with
this
wicked
pride
,
and
make
them
despise
their
equal
.
<EOS>
I
be
resolve
on
no
account
to
quit
my
dear
Fanny
;
no
,
though
I
could
raise
her
as
high
above
her
present
station
as
you
have
raise
my
sister

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
sister
,
as
well
as
myself
,
"
say
Booby
,
"
be
greatly
oblige
to
you
for
the
comparison
:
but
,
sir
,
she
be
not
worthy
to
be
compare
in
beauty
to
my
Pamela
;
nor
hath
<EOS>
she
half
her
merit

<EOS>
and
besides
,
sir
,
as
you
civilly
throw
my
marriage
with
your
sister
in
my
tooth
,
I
must
teach
you
the
wide
difference
between
us
:
my
fortune
enable
me
to
please
myself
;
and
it
would
have
be
as
overgrow
a
folly
in
me
to
have
omit
it

in
you
to
do
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
fortune
enable
me
to
please
myself
likewise

"
say
Joseph
;
"
for
all
my
pleasure
be
center
in
Fanny
;
and
whilst
I
have
health
I
shall
be
able
to
support
her
with
my
labour
in
that
station
to
which
she
be
bear

<EOS>
with
which
she
be
content

"
 
<EOS>
"
Brother
,
"
say
Pamela
,
"
Mr
Booby
advise
you
as
a
friend
;
and
no
doubt
my
papa

mamma
will
be
of
his
opinion

will
have
great
reason

angry
with

throw
down
our

It

become

to

for
the
assistance

to
indulge
it

you

<EOS>

She

Pamela

I
be
no

Pamela

I
be

this
gentleman

be
above
her

<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
never
behave
with
an
unbecoming
pride

<EOS>
but
,
at
the

I
shall
always
endeavour

<EOS>
"
They
be
now
summon
to
breakfast
,
and
thus
end
their
discourse
for
the
present
,
very
little
to
the
satisfaction
of
any
of
the
party
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
be
now
walk
in
an
avenue
at
some
distance
from
the
house
,
where
Joseph
have
promise
to
take
the
first
opportunity
of
come
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
a
shilling
in

world
,
and
have
subsist
ever
since
her
return
entirely
on
the
charity
of
parson
Adams
.
<EOS>
a
young
gentleman
,
attend
by
many
servant
,
come
up
to
her
,
and
ask
her
if
that
be
not
the
Lady
Booby
's
house
before
him
?
<EOS>
this
,
indeed
,
he
well
know
;
but
have
frame
the
question
for
no
other
reason
than
to
make
her
look
up
,
and
discover
if
her
face
be
equal
to
the
delicacy
of
her
shape
.
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
see
it
than
he
be
strike
with
amazement
.
<EOS>
He
stopt
his
horse
,
and
swear
she
be
the
most
beautiful
creature
he
ever
behold
.
<EOS>
then
,
instantly
alight
and
deliver
his
horse
to
his
servant
,
he
rapt
out
half
-
a
-
dozen
oath
that
he
would
kiss
her
;
to
which
she
at
first
submit
,
beg
he
would
not
be
rude
;
but
he
be
not
satisfied
with
the
civility
of
a
salute
,
nor
even
with
the
rude
attack
he
could
make
on
her
lip
,
but
catch
her
in
his
arm
,
and
endeavour
to
kiss
her
breast
,
which
with
all
her
strength
she
resist
,
and
,
as
our
spark
be
not
of
the
herculean
race
,
with
some
difficulty
prevent

<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
,
be
soon
out
of
breath
in
the
struggle
,
quit
her
,
and
,
remount
his
horse
,
call
one
of
his
servant
to
him
,
whom
he
order
to
stay
behind
with
her
,
and
make
her
any
offer
whatever
to
prevail
on
her
to
return
home
with
him
in
the
evening
;
and
to
assure
her
he
would
take
her
into
keeping
.
<EOS>
He
then
ride
on
with
his
other
servant
,
and
arrive
at
the
lady
's
house
,
to
whom
he
be
a
distant

<EOS>
She
be
entirely
deaf

his
offer

reject
them
with
the
utmost
disdain

<EOS>
at
last
the
pimp
,
who
have
perhaps
more
warm
blood
about
him
than
his
master

begin
to
sollicit
for
himself
;
he
tell
her

though
he

of
some
fortune

which
he
would
make
her
mistress
of
;
and
this
without
any
insult
to
her
virtue
,
for
that
he
would
marry
her
.
<EOS>
She
answer
,
if
his
master
himself
,
or
the
great
lord
in
the
land
,
would
marry
her
,
she
would
refuse
him
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
be
weary
with
persuasion
,
and
on
fire
with
charm
which
would
have
almost
kindle
a
flame
in
the
bosom
of
an
ancient
philosopher
or
modern
divine
,
he
fasten
his
horse
to
the
ground
,
and
attack
her
with
much
more
force
than
the
gentleman
have
exert
.
<EOS>
poor
Fanny
would
not
have
be
able
to
resist
his
rudeness
a
short
time
,
but
the
deity
who
preside
over
chaste
love
send
her
Joseph
to
her
assistance
.
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
come
within
sight
,
and
perceive
her
struggle
with
a
man
,
than
,
like
a
cannon
-
ball
,
or
like
lightning
,
or
anything
that
be
swift
,
if
anything
be
,
he
run
towards
her
,
and
,
come
up
just
as
the
ravisher
have
tear
her
handkerchief
from
her
breast
,
before
his
lip
have
touch
that
seat
of
innocence
and
bliss
,
he
deal
him
<EOS>
so
lusty
a
blow
in
that
part
of
his
neck
which
a
rope
would
have
become
with
the
utmost
propriety
,
that
the
fellow
staggered
backwards
,
and
,
perceive
he
have
to
do
with
something
rough
than
the
little
,
tender
,
tremble
hand
of
Fanny
<EOS>
,
he
quit
her
,
and
,
turn
about
,
see
his
rival
,
with
fire
flash
from
his
eye
,
again
ready
to
assail
him
;
and
,
indeed
,
before
he
could
well
defend
himself
,
or
return
the
first
blow
,
he
receive
a
second
,
which
,
have
it
fall
on
that
part
of
the
stomach
to
which
it
be
direct
,
would
have
be
probably
the
last
he
would
have
have
any
occasion
for
;
but
the
ravisher
,
lift
up
his
hand
,
drive
the
blow
upwards
to
his
mouth
,
whence
<EOS>
it
dislodge
three
of
his
tooth
;
and
now
,
not
conceive
any
extraordinary
affection
for
the
beauty
of
Joseph
's
person
,
nor
be
extremely
pleased
with
this
method
of
salutation
,
he
collect
all
his
force
,
and
aim
a
blow
at
Joseph
's
breast
,
which
he
artfully
parry
with
one
fist
,
so
that
it
lose
its
force
entirely
in
air
;
and
,
step
one
foot
backward
,
he
dart
his
fist
so
fiercely
at
his
enemy
,
that
,
have
he
not
catch
it
in
his
hand
(
for
he
be
a
boxer
of
no
inferior
fame
)
,
it
must
have
tumble
him
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
and
now
the
ravisher
meditate
another
blow
,
which
he
aim
at
that
part
of
the
breast
where
the
heart
be
lodge
;
Joseph
do
not
catch
it
as
before
,
yet
so
prevent
its
aim
that
it
fall
directly
on
his
nose
,
but
with
abated
force
.
<EOS>
Joseph
then
,
move
both
fist
and
foot
forwards
at
the
same
time
,
throw
his
head
so
dexterously
into
the
stomach
of
the
ravisher
that
he
fall
a
lifeless
lump
on
the
field
,
where
he
lie
many
minute
breathless
and
motionless
.
  
<EOS>
when
Fanny
see
her
Joseph
receive
a
blow
in
his
face
,
and
blood
run
in
a
stream
from
him
,
she
begin
to
tear
her
hair
and
invoke
all
human
and
divine
power
to
his
assistance
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
,
however
,
long
under
this
affliction
before
Joseph
,
have
conquer
his
enemy
,
run
to
her
,
and
assure
her
he
be
not
hurt
;
she
then
instantly
fall
on
her
knee
,
and
thank
God
that
he
have
make
Joseph
the
mean
of
her
rescue
,
and
at
the
same
time
preserve
him
from
be
injure
in
attempt
it
.
<EOS>
She
offer
,
with
her
handkerchief
,
to
wipe
his
blood
from
his
face
;
but
he
,
see
his
rival
attempt
to
recover
his
leg
,
turn
to
him
,
and
ask
him
if
he
have
enough
?
<EOS>
to
which
the
other
answer
he
have
;
for
he
believe
he
have
fight
with
the
devil
instead
of
a
man
;
and
,
loosen
his
horse
,
say
he
should
not
have
attempt
the
wench
if
he
have
know
she
have
be
so
well
provide
for
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
now
beg
Joseph
to
return
with
her
to
parson
Adams
,
and
to
promise
that
he
would
leave
her
no
more
.
<EOS>
these
be
proposition
so
agreeable
to
Joseph
,
<EOS>
that
,
have
he
hear
them
,
he
would
have
give
an
immediate
assent
;
but
indeed
his
eye
be
now
his
only
sense
;
for
you
may
remember
,
reader
,
that
the
ravisher
have
tear
her
handkerchief
from
Fanny
's
neck
,
by
which
he
have
discover
such
a
sight
,
that
Joseph
hath
declare
all
the
statue
he
ever
beheld
be
so
much
inferior
to
it
in
beauty
,
that
it
be
more
capable
of
convert
a
man
into
a
statue
than
of
be
imitate
by
the
great
master
of
that
art
.
<EOS>
this
modest
creature
,
whom
no
warmth
in
summer
could
ever
induce
to
expose
her
charm
to
the
wanton
sun
,
a
modesty
to
which
,
perhaps
,
they
owe
their
inconceivable
whiteness
,
have
stand
many
minute
bare
-
necked
in
the
presence
of
Joseph
before
her
apprehension
of
his
danger
and
the
horror
of
see
his
blood
would
suffer
her
once
to
reflect
on
what
concerned
herself
;
till
at
last
,
when
the
cause
of
her
concern
have
vanish
,
an
admiration
at
his
silence
,
together
with
observe
the
fix
position
of
his
eye
,
produce
an
idea
in
the
lovely
maid
which
bring
more
blood
into
her
face
than
have
flow
from
Joseph
's
nostril
.
<EOS>
the
snowy
hue
of
her
bosom
be
likewise
change
to
vermilion
at
the
instant
when
she
clap
her
handkerchief
<EOS>
round
her
neck
.
<EOS>
Joseph
see
the
uneasiness
she
suffer
,
and
immediately
remove
his
eye
from
an
object
,
in
surveying
which
he
have
feel
the
great
delight
which
the
organ
of
sight
be
capable
of
convey
to
his
soul
;
 
<EOS>
so
great
be
his
fear
of
offend
her
,
and
so
truly
do
his
passion
for
her
deserve
the
noble
name
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
,
be
recover
from
her
confusion
,
which
be
almost
equal
by
what
Joseph
have
feel
from
observe
it
,
again
mention
her
request
;
this
be
instantly
and
gladly
comply
with
;
and
together
they
cross
two
or
three
field
,
which
bring
them
to
the
habitation
of
Mr
Adams
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
a
discourse
which
happen
between
Mr
Adams
,
Mrs
Adams
,
Joseph
,
and
Fanny
;
with
some
behaviour
of
Mr
Adams
which
will
be
call
by
some
few
reader
very
low
,
absurd
,
and
unnatural
.
  
<EOS>
the
parson
and
his
wife
have
just
end
a
long
dispute
when
the
lover
come
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
this
young
couple
have
be
the
subject
of
the
dispute
;
for
Mrs
Adams
be
one
of
those
prudent
people
who
never
do
anything
to
injure
their
family
,
or
,
perhaps
,
one
of
those
good
mother
who
would
even
stretch
their
conscience
to
serve
their
child
.
<EOS>
She
have
long
entertain
hope
of
see
her
eld
daughter
succeed
Mrs
Slipslop
,
and
of
make
her
second
son
an
exciseman
by
Lady
Booby
's
interest
.
<EOS>
these
be
expectation
she
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
quitting
,
and
be
,
therefore
,
very
uneasy
to
see
her
husband
so
resolute
to
oppose
the
lady
's
intention
in
Fanny
's
affair
.
<EOS>
She
tell
him
,
"
It
behove
every
man
to
take
the
first
care
of
his
family
;
that
he
have
a
wife
and
six
child
,
the
maintaining
and
provide
for
whom
would
be
business
enough
for
him
without
intermeddle
in
other
folk
'
affair
;
that
he
have
always
preach
up
submission
to
superior
,
and
would
do
ill
to
give
an
example
of
the
contrary
behaviour
in
his
own
conduct
;
that
if
Lady
Booby
do
wrong
she
must
answer
for
it
herself
,
and
the
sin
would
not
lie
at
their
door
;
that
Fanny
have
be
a
servant
,
and
breed
up
in
the
lady
's
own
family
,
and
consequently
she
must
have
know
more
of
her
than
they
do
,
and
it
be
very
improbable
,
<EOS>
if
she
have
behave
herself
well
,
that
the
lady
would
have
be
so
bitterly
her
enemy
;
that
perhaps
he
be
too
much
inclined
to
think
well
of
her
because
she
be
handsome
,
but
handsome
woman
be
often
no
well
than
they
should
be
;
that
g
#
#
#
#
make
ugly
woman
as
well
as
handsome
one
;
and
that
if
a
woman
have
virtue
it
signify
nothing
whether
she
have
beauty
or
no
.
<EOS>
"
for
all
which
reason
she
conclude
he
should
oblige
the
lady
,
and
stop
the
future
publication
of
the
bann
.
<EOS>
but
all
these
excellent
argument
have
no
effect
on
the
parson
,
who
persist
in
do
his
duty
without
regard
the
consequence
it
may
have
on
his
worldly
interest
.
<EOS>
He
endeavour
to
answer
her
as
well
as
he
could
;
to
which
she
have
just
finish
her
reply
(
for
she
have
always
the
last
word
everywhere
but
at
church
)
<EOS>
when
Joseph
and
Fanny
enter
their
kitchen
,
where
the
parson
and
his
wife
then
sit
at
breakfast
over
some
bacon
and
cabbage
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
coldness
in
the
civility
of
Mrs
Adams
which
person
of
accurate
speculation
may
have
observe
,
but
escape
her
present
guest
;
indeed
,
it
be
a
good
deal
cover
by
the
heartiness
of
Adams
,
who
no
sooner
hear
that
Fanny
have
neither
eat
nor
drank
that
morning
than
he
present
her
a
bone
of
bacon
he
have
just
be
gnaw
,
be
the
only
remain
of
his
provision
,
and
then
run
nimbly
to
the
tap
,
and
produce
a
mug
of
small
beer
,
which
he
call
ale
;
however
,
it
be
the
good
in
his
house
.
<EOS>
Joseph
,
address
himself
to
the
parson
,
tell
him
the
discourse
which
have
past
between
Squire
Booby
,
his
sister
,
and
himself
concern
Fanny
;
he
then
acquaint
him
with
the
danger
<EOS>
whence
he
have
rescue
her
,
and
communicate
some
apprehension
on
her
account
.
<EOS>
He
conclude
that
he
should
never
have
an
easy
moment
till
Fanny
be
absolutely
his
,
and
beg
that
he
may
be
suffer
to
fetch
a
licence
,
say
he
could
easily
borrow
the
money
.
<EOS>
the
parson
answer
,
that
he
have
already
give
his
sentiment
concern
a
licence
,
and
that
a
very
few
day
would
make
it
unnecessary
.
"
<EOS>
Joseph
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
wish
this
haste
doth
not
arise
rather
from
your
impatience
than
your
fear
;
but
,
as
it
certainly
spring
from
one
of
these
cause
,
I
will
examine
both
.
<EOS>
of
each
of
these
therefore
in
their
turn
;
and
first
for
the
first
of
these
,
namely
,
impatience
.
<EOS>
now
,
child
,
I
must
inform
you
that
,
if
in
your
purposed
marriage
with
this
young
woman
you
have
no
intention
but
the
indulgence
of
carnal
appetite
,
you
be
guilty
of
a
very
heinous
sin
.
<EOS>
marriage
be
ordain
for
noble
purpose
,
as
you
will
learn
when
you
hear
the
service
provide
on
that
occasion
read
to
you
.
<EOS>
nay
,
perhaps
,
if
you
be
a
good
lad
,
I
,
child
,
shall
give
you
a
sermon
gratis
,
wherein
I
shall
demonstrate
how
little
regard
ought
to
be
have
to
the
flesh
on
such
occasion
.
<EOS>
the
text
will
be
Matthew
the
5th
,
and
part
of
the
28th
verse
 
<EOS>
Whosoever
looketh
on
a
woman
,
so
as
to
lust
after
her
.
<EOS>
the
latter
part
I
shall
omit
,
as
foreign
to
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
all
such
brutal
lust
and
affection
be
to
be
greatly
subdue
,
if
not
totally
eradicate
,
before
the
vessel
can
be
say
to
be
consecrate
to
honour
.
<EOS>
to
marry
with
a
view
of
gratify
those
inclination
be
a
prostitution
of
that
holy
ceremony
,
and
must
entail
a
curse
on
all
who
so
lightly
undertake
it
.
<EOS>
if
,
therefore
,
this
haste
arise
from
impatience
,
you
be
to
correct
,
and
not
give
way
to
it
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
to
the
second
head
which
I
propose
to
speak
to
,
namely
,
fear
:
it
argue
a
diffidence
,
highly
criminal
,
of
that
power
in
which
alone
we
should
put
our
trust
,
see
we
may
be
well
assure
that
he
be
able
,
not
only
to
defeat
the
design
of
our
enemy
,
but
even
to
turn
their
heart
.
<EOS>
instead
of
take
,
therefore
,
any
unjustifiable
or
desperate
mean
to
rid
ourselves
of
fear
,
we
should
resort
to
prayer
only
on
these
occasion
;
and
we
may
be
then
certain
of
obtain
what
be
good
for
us
.
<EOS>
when
any
accident
threaten
us
we
be
not
to
despair
,
nor
,
when
it
overtake
us
,
to
grieve
;
we
must
submit
in
all
thing
to
the
will
of
Providence
,
and
set
our
affection
so
much
on
nothing
here
that
we
can
not
quit
it
without
reluctance
.
<EOS>
You
be
a
young
man
,
and
can
know
<EOS>
but
little
of
this
world
;
I
be
old
,
and
have
see
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
all
passion
be
criminal
in
their
excess
;
and
even
love
itself
,
if
it
be
not
subservient
to
our
duty
,
may
render
us
blind
to
it
.
<EOS>
have
Abraham
so
love
his
son
Isaac
as
to
refuse
the
sacrifice
require
,
be
there
any
of
us
who
would
not
condemn
him
?
<EOS>
Joseph
,
I
know
your
many
good
quality
,
and
value
you
for
them
;
but
,
as
I
be
to
render
an
account
of
your
soul
,
which
be
commit
to
my
cure
,
I
can
not
see
any
fault
without
remind
you
of
it
.
<EOS>
You
be
too
much
inclined
to
passion
,
child
,
and
have
set
your
affection
so
absolutely
on
this
young
woman
,
that
,
if
g
#
#
#
#
require
her
at
your
hand
,
I
fear
you
would
reluctantly
part
with
her
.
<EOS>
now
,
believe
me
,
no
Christian
ought
so
to
set
his
heart
on
any
person
or
thing
in
this
world
,
but
that
,
whenever
it
shall
be
require
or
take
from
him
in
any
manner
by
Divine
Providence
,
he
may
be
able
,
peaceably
,
quietly
,
and
contentedly
to
resign
it
.
"
<EOS>
at
which
word
one
come
hastily
in
,
and
acquaint
Mr
Adams
that
his
young
son
be
drown
.
<EOS>
He
stand
silent
a
moment
,
and
soon
begin
to
stamp
about
the
room
and
deplore
his
loss
with
the
bitter
agony
.
<EOS>
Joseph
,
who
be
overwhelmed
with
concern
likewise
,
recover
himself
sufficiently
to
endeavour
to
comfort
the
parson
;
in
which
attempt
he
use
many
argument
that
he
have
at
several
time
remember
out
of
his
own
discourse
,
both
in
private
and
public
(
for
he
be
a
great
enemy
to
the
passion
,
and
preach
nothing
more
than
the
conquest
of
them
by
reason

it

could

bear
it

my

the

the

to

snatch
out

offend
me

It
be

<EOS>
this
morning
I
give
him
his
first
lesson
in
Que
Genus

this
be
the
very
book
he
learn
;
poor
child
!
<EOS>
it
be
of
no
further
use
to
thee
now
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
make
the
good
scholar
,
and
have
be
an
ornament
to
the
Church
;
 
such
part
and
such
goodness
never
meet

so
young

and
the
handsome
lad
too

say
Mrs
Adams
,
recover
from
a
swoon
in
Fanny
's
arm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
poor
Jacky

shall
I
never
see
thee
more

cry
the
parson
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
surely
,
"
say
Joseph
,
"
and
in
a
well
place
;
you
will
meet
again
,
never

more

<EOS>
"
I
believe
the
parson
do
not
hear
these
word
,
for
he
pay
little
regard
to
them
,
but
go
on
lamenting
,
whilst
the
tear
trickle
down
into
his
bosom
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
cry
out
,
"
<EOS>
where
be
my
little
darling
?
"
and
be
sallye
out
,
when
to
his
great
surprize
and
joy
,
in
which
I
hope
the
reader
will
sympathize
,
he
meet
his
son
in
a
wet
condition
indeed
,
but
alive
and
run
towards
him
.
<EOS>
the
person
who
bring
the
news
of
his
misfortune
have
be
a
little
too
eager
,
as
people
sometimes
be
,
from
,
I
believe
,
no
very
good
principle
,
to
relate
ill
news
;
and
,
see
him
fall
into
the
river
,
instead
of
run
to
his
assistance
,
directly
run
to
acquaint
his
father
of
a
fate
which
he
have
conclude
to
be
inevitable
,
but
whence
the
child
be
relieve
by
the
same
poor
pedlar
who
have
relieve
his
father
before
from
a
less
distress
.
<EOS>
the
parson
's
joy
be
now
as
extravagant
as
his
grief
have
be
before
;
he
kiss
and
embrace
his
son
a
thousand
time
,
and
dance
about
the
room
like
one
frantic
;
but
as
soon
as
he
discover
the
face
of
his
old
friend
the
pedlar
,
and
hear
the
fresh
obligation
he
have
to
him
,
what
be
his
sensation
?
<EOS>
not
those
which
two

those

a
great

the
vile
treacherous

his
wicked
purpose

not
those
with
which
a
worthless
young

wish
his

joy
of
a
son

a
man
congratulate
his
rival
on
his
obtain
a
mistress

a
place

an
honour

<EOS>
no

he
feel
the
ebullition

the
overflowing
of
a
full

honest
,
open
heart

towards
the
person
who
have
confer
a
real

of
which

if
thou
canst
not

an

I

not

when
these
tumult
be
over

the

take
Joseph
aside

thus

<EOS>
the
patience
of
Joseph

of

could
bear
no

he
interrupt
the

say
,
"
It
be
easy
to
give
advice

take

do
he
perceive

Adams

raise
his

Thou

if
I

surely
her

would
grieve

<EOS>
"
yes

such

be
foolishness

indeed

it

"
every
man
ought
to
love
his

no

we
be

so
to
do

we
ought
to
love
her
with
moderation

discretion

I
be
afraid
I
shall
be
guilty
of
some
sin
in
spite
of
all
my

Joseph
;
"
for
I
shall
love
without
any
moderation

I
be
sure

You
talk
foolishly

childishly

Adams

<EOS>

indeed

Mrs

who
have
listen
to
the
latter
part

their
conversation

"
you
talk
more
foolishly
yourself

<EOS>
I
hope
,
my
dear
,
you
will
never
preach
any
such
doctrine
as
that
husband
can
love
their
wife
too
well
.
<EOS>
if
I
know
you
have
such
a
sermon
in
the
house
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
would
burn
it
,
and
I
declare
,
if
I
have
not
be
convince
you
have
love
me
as
well
as
you
could

I
can
answer
for
myself
,
I
should
have
hate
and
despise
you

<EOS>
marry
come
up
!
<EOS>
fine
doctrine
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
a
wife
hath
a
right
to
insist
on
her
husband
's
love
her
as
much
as
ever
he
can
;
and
he
be
a
sinful
villain
who
doth
not

<EOS>
doth
he
not
promise
to
love
her
,
and
to
comfort
her
,
and
to
cherish
her
,

all
that
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
remember
it
all
as
well
as
if
I
have
repeat
it
over
but
yesterday
,
and
shall
never
forget
it
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
be
certain
you
do
not
preach
as
you
practise
;
for
you
have
be
a
loving
and
a
cherish
husband
to
me
;
that
be
the
truth
on't
;
and
why
you
should
endeavour
to
put
such
wicked
nonsense
into
this
young
man
's
head
<EOS>
I
can
not
devise
.
<EOS>
do
not
hearken
to
him
,
Mr
Joseph
;
be
as
good
a
husband
as
you
be
able
,
and
love
your
wife
with
all
your
body
and
soul
too
.

"
here
a
violent
rap
at
the
door
put
an
end
to
their
discourse
,
and
produce
a
scene
which
the
reader
will
find
in
the
next
chapter
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
a
visit
which
the
polite
Lady
Booby
and
her
polite
friend
pay
to
the
parson
.
  
<EOS>
the
Lady
Booby
have
no
sooner
have
an
account
from
the
gentleman
of
his
meeting
a
wonderful
beauty
near
her
house
,
and
perceive
the
rapture
with
which
he
speak
of
her
,
than
,
immediately
conclude
it
must
be
Fanny
<EOS>
,
she
begin
to
meditate
a
design
of
bring
them
better
acquaint
;
and
to
entertain
hope
that
the
fine
clothe
,
present
,
and
promise
of
this
youth
,
would
prevail
on
her
to
abandon
Joseph
:
she
therefore
propose
to
her
company
a
walk
in
the
field
before
dinner
,
when
she
lead
them
towards
Mr
Adams
's
house
;
and
,
as
she
approach
it
,
tell
them
if
they
please
she
would
divert
them
with
one
of
the
most
ridiculous
sight
they
have
ever
see
,
which
be
an
old
foolish
parson
,
who
,
she
say
,
laugh
,
keep
a
wife
and
six
brat
on
a
salary
of
about
twenty
pound
a
year
;
add
,
that
there
be
not
such
another
ragged
family
in
the
parish
.
<EOS>
They
all
readily
agree
to
this
visit
,
and
arrive
whilst
Mrs
Adams
be
declaim
as
in
the
last
chapter
.
<EOS>
Beau
Didapper
,
which
be
the
name
of
the
young
gentleman
we
have
see
ride
towards
Lady
Booby
's
,
with
his
cane
mimic
the
rap
of
a
London
footman
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
the
people
within
,
namely
,
Adams
,
his
wife
and
three
child
,
Joseph
,
Fanny
,
and
the
pedlar
,
be
all
throw
into
confusion
by
this
knock
,
but
Adams
go
directly
to
the
door
,
which
be
open
,
the
Lady
Booby
and
her
company
walk
in
,
and
be
receive
by
the
parson
with
about
two
hundred
bow
,
and
by
his
wife
with
as
many
curtsy
;
the
latter
tell
the
lady
"
She
be
ashamed
to
be
see
in
such
a
pickle
,
and
that
her
house
be
in
such
a
litter
;
but
that
if
she
have
expect
such
an
honour
from
her
ladyship
she
should
have
find
her
in
a
well
manner
.
<EOS>
"
the
parson
make
no
apology
,
though
he
be
in
his
half
-
cassock
and
a
flannel
nightcap
.
<EOS>
He
say
"
They
be
heartily
welcome
to
his
poor
cottage
,
"
and
turn
to
Mr
Didapper
,
cry
out
,
"
non
mea
renidet
in
domo
lacunar
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
beau
answer
,
"
He
do
not
understand
Welsh
;
"
at
which
the
parson
stare
and
make
no
reply
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Didapper
,
or
beau
Didapper
,
be
a
young
gentleman
of
about
four
foot
five
inch
in
height
.
<EOS>
He
wear
his
own
hair
,
though
the
scarcity
of
it
may
have
give
him
sufficient
excuse
for
a
periwig
.
<EOS>
His
face
be
thin
and
pale
;
the
shape
of
his
body
and
leg
none
of
the
good
,
for
he
have
very
narrow
shoulder
and
no
calf
;
and
his
gait
may
more
properly
be
call
hopping
than
walk
.
<EOS>
the
qualification
of
his
mind
be
well
adapt
to
his
person
.
<EOS>
We
shall
handle
them
first
negatively
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
entirely
ignorant
;
for
he
could
talk
a
little
French
and
sing
two
or
three
italian
song
;
he
have
live
too
much
in
the
world
to
be
bashful
,
and
too
much
at
court
to
be
proud
:
he
seem
not
much
inclined
to
avarice
,
for
he
be
profuse
in
his
expense
;
nor
have
he
all
the
feature
of
prodigality
,
for
he
never
give
a
shilling
:
no
hater
of
woman
,
<EOS>
for
he
always
dangle
after
them
;
yet
so
little
subject
to
lust
,
that
he
have
,
among
those
who
know
him
best
,
the
character
of
great
moderation
in
his
pleasure
;
no
drinker
of
wine
;
nor
so
addicted
to
passion
but
that
a
hot
word
or
two
from
an
adversary
make
him
immediately
cool
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
to
give
him
only
a
dash
or
two
on
the
affirmative
side
:
though
he
be
bear
to
an
immense
fortune
,
he
choose
,
for
the
pitiful
and
dirty
consideration
of
a
place
of
little
consequence
,
to
depend
entirely
on
the
will
of
a
fellow
whom
they
call
a
great
man
;
who
treat
him
with
the
utmost
disrespect
,
and
exact
of
him
a
plenary
obedience
to
his
command
,
which
he
implicitly
submit
to
,
at
the
expense
of
his
conscience
,
his
honour
,
and
of
his
country
,
in
which
he
have
himself
so
very
large
a
share
.
<EOS>
and
to
finish
his
character
;
as
he
be
entirely
well
satisfied
with
his
own
person
and
part
,
so
he
be
very
apt
to
ridicule
and
laugh
at
any
imperfection
in
another
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
little
person
,
or
rather
thing
,
that
hop
after
Lady
Booby
into
Mr
Adams
's
kitchen
.
  
<EOS>
the
parson
and
his
company
retreat
from
the
chimney
-
side
,
where
they
have
be
seat
,
to
give
room
to
the
lady
and
her
.
<EOS>
instead
of
return
any
of
the
curtsy
or
extraordinary
civility
of
Mrs
Adams
,
the
lady
,
turn
to
Mr
Booby
,
cry
out
,
"
Quelle
Bete
!
<EOS>
Quel
Animal
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
presently
after
discover
Fanny
(
for
she
do
not
need
the
circumstance
of
her
standing
by
Joseph
to
assure
the
identity
of
her
person
)
,
she
ask
the
beau
"
whether
he
do
not
think
her
a
pretty
girl
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Begad
,
madam
,
"
answer
he
,
"
'
<EOS>
tis
the
very
same
I
meet
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
imagine
,
"
reply
the
lady
,
"
you
have
so
good
a
taste
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
because
I
never
like
you
,
I
warrant
,
"
cry
the
beau
.
<EOS>
"
ridiculous
!
<EOS>
"
say
she
:
"
you
know
you
be
always
my
aversion
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
would
never
mention
aversion
,
"
answer
the
beau
,
"
with
that
face[a
]
;
dear
Lady
Booby
,
wash
your
face
before
you
mention
aversion
,
I
beseech
you
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
laugh
,
and
turn
about
to
coquet
it
with
Fanny
.
  
<EOS>
[

<EOS>
lest
this
should
appear
unnatural
to
some
reader
,
we
think
proper
    
to
acquaint
them

that
it
be
take
verbatim
from
very
polite
    
conversation

<EOS>
Mrs
Adams
have
be
all
this
time
beg
and
pray
the
lady
to
sit
down
,
a
favour
which
she
at
last
obtain
.
<EOS>
the
little
boy
to
whom
the
accident
have
happen
,
still
keep
his
place
by
the
fire

be
chid

his
mother

but
Lady
Booby
take
his
part

and
,
commend
his
beauty

tell
the
parson

his
very
picture

<EOS>
She
then
,
see
a
book
in
his
hand

ask
"
if
he
could

<EOS>
"

but
the

make
no

till
he
see
the

knit
his
brow
,
and
then
cry
,
"
I

woman

a
day

two
pass
after

instance

this
appear

it
be
impossible
to
conceal
it
long
.
<EOS>
both
she
and
her
husband
soon
lose
all
apprehension
from
their
friend
's
presence
,

fall
to
their
dispute
with
as
much
vigour
as
ever
.

these
be
still
pursue
with
the
utmost
ardour
and
eagerness
,
however
trifle
the
cause
be
whence
they
first
arise
.
<EOS>
nay
,
however
incredible
it
may
seem
,
the
little
consequence
of
the
matter
in
debate
be
frequently
give
as
a
reason
for
the
fierceness
of
the
contention
,
as
thus
:
"
if
you
love
me
,
sure
you
would
never
dispute
with
me
such
a
trifle
as
this
.
"
the
answer
to
which
be
very
obvious
;
for
the
argument
would
hold
equally
on
both
side
,
and
be
constantly
retort
with
some
addition
,
as
"
I
be
sure
I
have
much
more
reason
to
say
so
,
who
be
in
the
right
.
"
during
all
these
dispute
,
Paul
always
keep
strict
silence
,
and
preserve
an
even
countenance
,
without
show
the
least
visible
inclination
to
either
party
.
<EOS>
one
day
,
however
,
when
madam
have
leave
the
room
in
a
violent
fury
,
Lennard
could
not
refrain
from
refer
his
cause
to
his
friend
.
<EOS>
be
ever
anything
so
unreasonable
,
say
he
,
as
this
woman
?
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
with
her
?
<EOS>
I
doat
on
her
to
distraction
;
nor
have
I
any
cause
to
complain
of
,
more
than
this
obstinacy
in
her
temper
;
whatever
she
assert
,
she
will
maintain
against
all
the
reason
and
conviction
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
pray
give
me
your
advice
.
 
<EOS>
first
,
say
Paul
,
I
will
give
my
opinion
,
which
be
,
flatly
,
that
you
be
in
the
wrong
;
for
,
suppose
she
be
in
the
wrong
,
be
the
subject
of
your
contention
any
way
material
?
<EOS>
what
signify
it
whether
you
be
marry
in
a
red
or
a
yellow
waistcoat
?
<EOS>
for
that
be
your
dispute
.
<EOS>
now
,
suppose
she
be
mistaken
;
as
you
love
her
you
say
so
tenderly
,
and
I
believe
she
deserve
it
,
would
it
not
have
be
wise
to
have
yield
,
though
you
certainly
know
yourself
in
the
right
,
than
to
give
either
her
or
yourself
any
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
if
ever
I
marry
,
I
be
resolve
to
enter
into
an
agreement
with
my
wife
,
that
in
all
dispute
(
especially
about
trifle
)
<EOS>
that
party
who
be
most
convinced
they
be
right
shall
always
surrender
the
victory
;
by
which
mean
we
shall
both
be
forward
to
give
up
the
cause
.
<EOS>
I
own
,
say
Lennard
,
my
dear
friend
,
shake
him
by
the
hand
,
there
be
great
truth
and
reason
in
what
you
say
;
and
I
will
for
the
future
endeavour
to
follow
your
advice
.
<EOS>
They
soon
after
break
up
the
conversation
,
and
Lennard
,
go
to
his
wife
,
ask
her
pardon
,
and
tell
her
his
friend
have
convince
him
he
have
be
in
the
wrong
.
<EOS>
She
immediately
begin
a
vast
encomium
on
Paul
,
in
which
he
second
her
,
and
both
agree
he
be
the
worthy
and
wise
man
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
when
next
they
meet
,
which
be
at
supper
,
though
she
have
promise
not
to
mention
what
her
husband
tell
her
,
she
could
not
forbear
cast
the
kind
and
most
affectionate
look
on
Paul
,
and
ask
him
,
with
the
sweetest
voice
,
whether
she
should
help
him
to
some
pot
woodcock
?
<EOS>
pot
partridge
,
my
dear
,
you
mean
,
say
the
husband
.
<EOS>
My
dear
,
say
she
,
I
ask
your
friend
if
he
will
eat
any
potted
woodcock
;
and
I
be
sure
I
must
know
,
who
pot
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
know
too
,
who
shoot
them
,
reply
the
husband
,
and
I
be
convinced
that
I
have
not
see
a
woodcock
this
year
;
however
,
though
I
know
I
be
in
the
right
,
I
submit
,
and
the
potted
partridge
be
pot
woodcock
if
you
desire
to
have
it
so
.
<EOS>
It
be
equal
to
me
,
say
she
,
whether
it
be
one
or
the
other
;
but
you
would
persuade
one
out
of
one
's
sense
;
to
be
sure
,
you
be
always
in
the
right
in
your
own
opinion
;
but
your
friend
,
I
believe
,
know
which
he
be
eat
.
<EOS>
Paul
answer
nothing
,
and
the
dispute
continue
,
as
usual
,
the
great
part
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
the
next
morning
the
lady
,
accidentally
meet
Paul
,
and
be
convince
he
be
her
friend
,
and
of
her
side
,
accost
him
thus
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
certain
,
<EOS>
sir
,
you
have
long
since
wonder
at
the
unreasonableness
of
my
husband
.
<EOS>
He
be
indeed
,
in
other
respect
,
a
good
sort
of
man
,
but
so
positive
,
that
no
woman
but
one
of
my
comply
temper
could
possibly
live
with
him
.
<EOS>
why
,
last
night
,
now
,
be
ever
any
creature
so
unreasonable
?
<EOS>
I
be
certain
you
must
condemn
him
.
<EOS>
pray
,
answer
me
,
be
he
not
in
the
wrong
?
<EOS>
Paul
,
after
a
short
silence
,
speak
as
follow
:
I
be
sorry
,
madam
,
that
,
as
good
manner
oblige
me
to
answer
against
my
will
,
so
an
adherence
to
truth
force
me
to
declare
myself
of
a
different
opinion
.
<EOS>
to
be
plain
and
honest
,
you
be
entirely
in
the
wrong
;
the
cause
I
own
not
worth
dispute
,
but
the
bird
be
undoubtedly
a
partridge
.
<EOS>
o
sir
!
<EOS>
reply
the
lady
,
I
can
not
possibly
help
your
taste
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
return
Paul
,
that
be
very
little
material
;
for
,
have
it
be
otherwise
,
a
husband
may
have
expect
submission
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
!
<EOS>
sir
,
say
she
,
I
assure
you
!
 
<EOS>
yes
,
madam
,
cry
he
,
he
may
,
from
a
person
of
your
excellent
understanding
;
and
pardon
me
for
say
,
such
a
condescension
would
have
show
a
superiority
of
sense
even
to
your
husband
himself
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
dear
sir
,
say
she
,
why
should
I
submit
when
I
be
in
the
right
?
 
<EOS>
for
that
very
reason
,
answer
he
;
it
would
be
the
great
instance
of
affection
imaginable
;
for
can
anything
be
a
great
object
of
our
compassion
than
a
person
we
love
in
the
wrong
?
<EOS>
ay
,
but
I
should
endeavour
,
say
she
,
to
set
him
right
.
<EOS>
pardon
me
,
madam
,
answer
Paul
:
I
will
apply
to
your
own
experience
if
you
ever
find
your
argument
have
that
effect
.
<EOS>
the
more
our
judgment
err
,
the
less
we
be
willing
to
own
it
:
for
my
own
part
,
I
have
always
observe
the
person
who
maintain
the
bad
side
in
any
contest
be
the
warm
.
<EOS>
why
,
say
she
,
I
must
confess
there
be
truth
in
what
you
say
,
and
I
will
endeavour
to
practise
it
.
<EOS>
the
husband
then
come
in
,
Paul
depart
.
<EOS>
and
Leonard
,
approach
his
wife
with
an
air
of
good
humour
,
tell
her
he
be
sorry
for
their
foolish
dispute
the
last
night
;
but
he
be
now
convince
of
his
error
.
<EOS>
She
answer
,
smile
,
she
believe
she
owe
his
condescension
to
his
complacence
;
that
she
be
ashamed
to
think
a
word
have
pass
on
so
silly
an
occasion
,
especially
as
she
be
satisfy
she
have
be
mistake
.
<EOS>
a
little
contention
follow
,
but
with
the
utmost
good
-
will
to
each
other
,
and
be
conclude
by
her
asserting
that
Paul
have
thoroughly
convince
her
she
have
be
in
the
wrong
.
<EOS>
upon
which
they
both
unite
in
the
praise
of
their
common
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
Paul
now
pass
his
time
with
great
satisfaction
,
these
dispute
be
much
less
frequent
,
as
well
as
short
than
usual
;
but
the
devil
,
or
some
unlucky
accident
in
which
perhaps
the
devil
have
no
hand
,
shortly
put
an
end
to
his
happiness
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
eternally
the
private
referee
of
every
difference
;
in
which
,
after
have
perfectly
,
as
he
think
,
establish
the
doctrine
of
submission
,
he
never
scruple
to
assure
both
privately
that
they
be
in
the
right
in
every
argument
,
as
before
he
have
follow
the
contrary
method
.
<EOS>
one
day
a
violent
litigation
happen
in
his
absence
,
and
both
party
agree
to
refer
it
to
his
decision

the

profess
himself
sure
the
decision
would
be
in
his
favour

the
wife
answer
,
he
may
be
mistake
;
for
she
believe
his
friend
be
convince
how
seldom
she
be
to
blame
;
and
that
if
he
know
all
 
<EOS>
the
husband
reply
,
My
dear
,
I
have
no
desire
of
any
retrospect
;
but
I
believe
,
if
you
know
all
too
,
you
would
not
imagine
my
friend
so
entirely
on
your
side
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
say
she
,
since
you
provoke
me
,
I
will
mention
one
instance
.
<EOS>
You
may
remember
our
dispute
about
send
Jackey
to
school
in
cold
weather
,
which
point
I
give
up
to
you
from
mere
compassion
,
know
myself
to
be
in
the
right
;
and
Paul
himself
tell
me
afterwards
he
think
me
so
.
<EOS>
My
dear
,
reply
the
husband
,
I
will
not
scruple
your
veracity
;
but
I
assure
you
solemnly
,
on
my
applying
to
him
,
he
give
it
absolutely
on
my
side
,
and
say
he
would
have
act
in
the
same
manner
.
<EOS>
They
then
proceed
to
produce
numberless
other
instance
,
in
all
which
Paul
have
,
on
vow
of
secresy
,
give
his
opinion
on
both
side
.
<EOS>
in
the
conclusion
,
both
believe
each
other
,
they
fall
severely
on
the
treachery
of
Paul
,
and
agree
that
he
have
be
the
occasion
of
almost
every
dispute
which
have
fall
out
between
them
.
<EOS>
They
then
become
extremely
loving
,
and
so
full
of
condescension
on
both
side
,
that
they
vye
with
each
other
in
censure
their
own
conduct
,
and
jointly
vent
their
indignation
on
Paul
,
whom
the
wife
,
fear
a
bloody
consequence
,
earnestly
entreat
her
husband
to
suffer
quietly
to
depart
the
next
day
,
which
be
the
time
fix
for
his
return
to
quarter
,
and
then
drop
his
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
"
however
ungenerous
this
behaviour
in
Lennard
may
be
esteem
,
his
wife
obtain
a
promise
from
him
(
though
with
difficulty
)
to
follow
her
advice
;
but
they
both
express
such
unusual
coldness
that
day
to
Paul
,
that
he
,
who
be
quick
of
apprehension
,
take
lennard
aside
,
press
him
so
home
,
that
he
at
last
discover
the
secret
.
<EOS>
Paul
acknowledge
the
truth
,
but
tell
him
the
design
with
which
he
have
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
to
which
the
other
answer
,
he
would
have
act
more
friendly
to
have
let
him
into
the
whole
design
;
for
that
he
may
have
assure
himself
of
his
secresy
.
<EOS>
Paul
reply
,
with
some
indignation
,
he
have
give
him
a
sufficient
proof
<EOS>
how
capable
he
be
of
conceal
a
secret
from
his
wife
.
<EOS>
lennard
return
with
some
warmth
 
he
have
more
reason
to
upbraid
him
,
for
that
he
have
cause
most
of
the
quarrel
between
them
by
his
strange
conduct
,
and
may
(
if
they
have
not
discover
the
affair
to
each
other
)
<EOS>
have
be
the
occasion
of
their
separation
.
<EOS>
Paul
then
say
"
 
B

a
stop

Joseph

have
bear
with
great

the
impertinence
of

Didapper
to
Fanny

who
have
be

pretty
freely
to
her

offer
her
settlement

the
respect
to
the
company
have
restrain
him
from
interfere
whilst
the
beau
confine
himself
to
the
use
of
his

beau

watch
an
opportunity
whilst
the
lady

eye
be
dispose
another
way
,
offer
a
rudeness
to
her
with
his

which
Joseph
no
sooner

than
he
present
him
with
so
sound
a
box
on
the
ear
,
that
it
convey
him
several

from
where

<EOS>
the
lady
immediately
scream
out
,
rise
from
their
chair
;
and
the
beau
,
as
soon
as
he
recover
himself
,
draw
his
hanger
:
which
Adams
observe
,
snatch
up
the
lid
of
a
pot
in
his
left
hand
,
and
,
cover
himself
with
it
as
with
a
shield
,
without
any
weapon
of
offence
in
his
other
hand
,
stept
in
before
Joseph
,
and
expose
himself
to
the
enraged
beau
,
who
threaten
such
perdition
and
destruction
,
that
it
fright
the
woman
,
who
be
all
get
in
a
huddle
together
,
out
of
their
wit
,
even
to
hear
his
denunciation
of
vengeance
.
<EOS>
Joseph
be
of
a
different
complexion
,
and
beg
Adams
to
let
his
rival
come
on
;
for
he
have
a
good
cudgel
in
his
hand
,
and
do
not
fear
him
.
<EOS>
Fanny
now
faint
into
Mrs
Adams
's
arm
,
and
the
whole
room
be
in
confusion
,
when
Mr
Booby
,
pass
by
Adams
,
who
lie
snug
under
the
pot
-
lid
,
come
up
to
Didapper
,
and
insist
on
his
sheathe
the
hanger
,
promise
he
should
have
satisfaction
;
which
Joseph
declare
he
would
give
him
,
and
fight
him
at
any
weapon
whatever
.
<EOS>
the
beau
now
sheathe
his
hanger

and
take
out
a
pocket

glass
,
and
vow
vengeance
all
the
time

the
parson
deposit
his

and
Joseph

run
to
Fanny

soon
bring
her
back
to
life
.
<EOS>
Lady
Booby
chid
Joseph
for
his
insult
on
Didapper
;
but
he
answer
,
he
would
have
attack
an
army
in
the
same
cause
.
<EOS>
"
what
cause
?
<EOS>
"
say
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Madam

"
answer
Joseph
,
"
he
be
rude
to
that
young

"
 
<EOS>
"
what
,
"
say
the
lady
,
"
I
suppose
he
would
have
kiss
the
wench

be
a
gentleman
to

strike
for
such
an
offer

<EOS>
I
must
tell
you

Joseph

these
air
do
not
become
you

"
 
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
say
Mr
Booby
,
"
I
see
the
whole
affair
,
and
I
do
not
commend
my
brother
;
for
I
can
not
perceive
why
he
should
take
upon
him
to
be
this
girl
's
champion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
commend
him
,
"
say
Adams
:
<EOS>
"
he
be
a
brave
lad
;
and
it
become
any
man
to
be
the
champion
of
the
innocent
;
and
he
must
be
the
basest
coward
who
would
not
vindicate
a
woman
with
whom
he
be
on
the
brink
of
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
Mr
Booby
,
"
my
brother
be
not
a
proper
match
for
such
a
young
woman
as
this
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Lady
Booby
;
"
nor
do
you
,
Mr
Adams
,
act
in
your
proper
character
by
encourage
any
such
doing
;
and
I
be
very
much
surprize
you
should
concern
yourself
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
your
wife
and
family
your
properer
care

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
madam
,
your
ladyship
say
very
true

"
answer
Mrs
Adams
:
"
he
talk
a
pack
of
nonsense
,
that
the
whole
parish
be
his
child
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
do
not
understand
what
he
mean
by
it
;
it
would
make
some
woman
suspect
he
have
go
astray
,
but
I
acquit
him
of
that
;
I
can
read
scripture
as
well
as
he
,
and
I
never
find
that
the
parson
be
oblige
to
provide
for
other
folk
'
child
;
and
besides
,
he
be
but
a
poor
curate

hath
<EOS>
little
enough
,
as
your

know
,
for
me

mine

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
say
<EOS>
very
well
,
Mrs
Adams
,
"
quoth
the
Lady
Booby
,
who
have
not
speak
a
word
to
her
before
;
"
you
seem
to
be
a
very
sensible
woman
;
and
I
assure
you
,
your
husband
be
act
a
very
foolish
part
,
and
oppose
his
own
interest
,
see
my
nephew
be
violently
set
against
this
match
:
and
indeed
I
can
not
blame
him
;
it
be
by
no
mean
one
suitable
to
our
family
.
<EOS>
"
in
this
manner
the
lady
proceed
with
Mrs
Adams
,
whilst
the
beau
hop
about
the
room
,
shake
his
head
,
partly
from
pain
and
partly
from
anger
;
and
Pamela
be
chide
Fanny
for
her
assurance
in
aim
at
such
a
match
as
her
brother
.
<EOS>
Poor
Fanny
answer
only
with
her
tear
,
which
have
long
since
begin
to
wet
her
handkerchief
;
which
Joseph
perceiving
,
take
her
by
the
arm
,
and
wrap
it
in
his
carry
her
off
,
swear
he
would
own
no
relation
to
any
one
who
be
an
enemy
to
her
<EOS>
he
love
more
than
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
He
go
out
with
Fanny
under
his
left
arm
,
brandish
a
cudgel
in
his
right
,
and
neither
Mr
Booby
nor
the
beau
think
proper
to
oppose
him
.
<EOS>
Lady
Booby
and
her
company
make
a
very
short
stay
behind
him
;
for
the
lady
's
bell
now
summon
them
to
dress
;
for
which
they
have
just
time
before
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
Adams
seem
now
very
much
dejected
,
which
his
wife
perceiving
,
begin
to
apply
some
matrimonial
balsam
.
<EOS>
She
tell
him
he
have
reason
to
be
concern
,
for
that
he
have
probably
ruin
his
family
with
his
trick
almost
;
but
perhaps
he
be
grieve
for
the
loss
of
his
two
child
,
Joseph
and
Fanny
.
<EOS>
His
eld
daughter
go
on
:
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
father
,
it
be
very
hard
to
bring
stranger
here
to
eat
your
child
's
bread
out
of
their
mouth
.
<EOS>
You
have
keep
them
ever
since
they
come
home
;
and
,
for
anything
I
see
to
the
contrary
,
may
keep
them
a
month
longer
;
be
you
oblige
to
give
her
meat
,
tho'f
<EOS>
she
be
never
so
handsome
?
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
see
she
be
so
much
handsome
than
other
people
.
<EOS>
if
people
be
to
be
keep
for
their
beauty
,
she
would
scarce
fare
better
than
her
neighbour
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
as
for
Mr
Joseph
,
I
have
nothing
to
say
;
he
be
a
young
man
of
honest
principle
,
and
will
pay
some
time
or
other
for
what
he
hath
;
but
for
the
girl
 
why
doth
she
not
return
to
her
place
she
run
away
from
?
<EOS>
I
would
not
give
such
a
vagabond
slut
a
halfpenny
though
I
have
a
million
of
money
;
no
,
though
she
be
starve
.
"
<EOS>
"
indeed
but
I
would
,
"
cry
little
Dick
;
"
and
,
father
,
rather
than
poor
Fanny
shall
be
starve
,
I
will
give
her
all
this
bread
and
cheese

<EOS>
(
offer
what
he
hold
in
his
hand
)
.
<EOS>
Adams
smile
on
the
boy
,
and
tell
him
he
rejoice
to
see
he
be
a
Christian
;
and
that
if
he
have
a
halfpenny
in
his
pocket
,
he
would
have
give
it
him
;
tell
him
it
be
his
duty
to
look
upon
all
his
neighbour
as
his
brother
and
sister
,
and
love
them
accordingly
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
papa
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
love
her
better
than
my
sister
,
for
she
be
handsome
than
any
of
them
.
"
<EOS>
"
be
she
so
,
saucebox
?
"
say
the
sister
,
give
him
a
box
on
the
ear
;
which
the
father
would
probably
have
resent
,
have
not
Joseph
,
Fanny
,
and
the
pedlar
at
that
instant
return
together
.
<EOS>
Adams
bid
his
wife
prepare
some
food
for
their
dinner
;
she
say
,
"
truly
she
could
not
,
she
have
something
else
to
do
.
"
<EOS>
Adams
rebuke
her
for
dispute
his
command
,
and
quote
many
text
of
scripture
to
prove
"
that
the
husband
be
the
head
of
the
wife
,
and
she
be
to
submit
and
obey
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
wife
answer
,
"
It
be
blasphemy
to
talk
Scripture
out
of
church
;
that
such
thing
be
very
proper
to
be
say
in
the
pulpit

but
that
it

profane
to

<EOS>
Joseph
tell
Mr

"
He
be
not
come
with
any
design
to
give
him
or
Mrs
Adams
any
trouble

to
desire
the
favour
of
all
their
company
to
the
George
(
an
ale

house
in

,
where

green

<EOS>
Mrs
Adams
,
who
be
a
very
good
sort
of
woman
,
only
rather
too
strict
in
oeconomie
,
readily
accept
this
invitation
,
as
do
the
parson
himself
by
her
example
;
and
away
they
all
walk
together
,
not
omit
little
Dick
,
to
whom
Joseph
give
a
shilling
when
he
hear
of
his
intend
liberality
to
Fanny

.
  
<EOS>
where
the
good
-
natured
reader
will
see
something
which
will
give
him
no
great
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
the
pedlar
have
be
very
inquisitive
from
the
time
he
have
first
hear
that
the
great
house
in
this
parish
belong
to
the
Lady
Booby
,
and
have
learn
that
she
be
the
widow
of
Sir
Thomas
,
and
that
Sir
Thomas
have
buy
Fanny
,
at
about
the
age
of
three
or
four
year
,
of
a
travel
woman
;
and
,
now
their
homely
but
hearty
meal
be
end
,
he
tell
Fanny
he
believe
he
could
acquaint
her
with
her
parent
.
<EOS>
the
whole
company
,
especially
she
herself
,
start
at
this
offer
of
the
pedlar
's
.
<EOS>
He
then
proceed
thus
,
while
they
all
lend
their
strict
attention
:
 
"
though
I
be
now
content
with
this
humble
way
of
get
my
livelihood
,
I
be
formerly
a
gentleman
;
for
so
all
those
of
my
profession
be
call
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
I
be
a
drummer
in
an
irish
regiment
of
foot
.
<EOS>
whilst
<EOS>
I
be
in
this
honourable
station
<EOS>
I
attend
an
officer
of
our
regiment
into
England
a

recruiting

in
our
march
from
Bristol
to
Froome

decay

clothing
town
have
furnish
the
army
with
a
great
number

<EOS>
we
overtook
on
the
road
a
woman
,
who
seem
to
be
about
thirty
year
old
or
thereabout
,
not
very
handsome
,
but
well
enough
for
a
soldier

<EOS>
as
we
come
up
to
her

she
mend
her
pace

and
fall
into
discourse
with
our

she
continue
to

on
with
us

<EOS>
I

perceive
she
must
fall
to
my

advance
presently
to
her

make
love
to
her
in
our
military
way

quickly
succeed

We
strike
a

rage

Slipslop

approach

ask
how

could
see
her

certainly
true

entirely
obliterate

wisely
make
just

despair

which
have
more
share

produce
the
resolution

hatred
we
have
see
take
,
begin
to
retreat
,
the
lady
hesitate
a
moment
,
and
then
,
forget
all
the
purport
of
her
soliloquy
,
dismiss
her
woman
again

with
order
to
bid
Tom
attend
her
in
the
parlour
,
whither
she
now
hasten
to
acquaint
Pamela
with
the
news
.
<EOS>
Pamela
say
she
could
not
believe
it
;
for
she
have
never
hear
that
her
mother
have
lose
any
child
,
or
that
she
have
ever
have
any
more
than
Joseph
and
herself
.
<EOS>
the
lady
fly
into
a
violent
rage
with
her
,
and
talk
of
upstart
and
disown
relation
who
have
so
lately
be
on
a
level
with
her

<EOS>
Pamela
make
no
answer
;
but
her
husband
,
take
up
her
cause
,
severely
reprimand
his
aunt
for
her
behaviour
to
his
wife
:
he
tell
her
,
if
it
have
be
earlier
in
the
evening
she
should
not
have
staid
a
moment
longer
in
her
house
;
that
he
be
convince
,
if
this
young
woman
could
be
prove
her
sister
,
she
would
readily
embrace
her
as
such
,
and
he
himself
would
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
He
then
desire
the
fellow
may
be
send
for
,
and
the
young
woman
with
him
,
which
Lady
Booby
immediately
order
;
and
,
think
proper
to
make
some
apology
to
Pamela
for
what
she
have
say
,
it
be
readily
accept
,
and
all
thing
reconcile
.
  
<EOS>
the
pedlar
now
attend
,
as
do
Fanny
and
Joseph
,
who
would
not
quit
her
;
the
parson
likewise
be
induce
,
not
only
by
curiosity
,
of
which
he
have
no
small
portion
,
but
his
duty
,
as
he
apprehend
it
,
to
follow
them
;
for
he
continue
all
the
way
to
exhort
them
,
who
be
now
break
their
heart
,
to
offer
up
thanksgiving
,

be
joyful

so
miraculous
an
escape

when
they
arrive
at
Booby
-
Hall
they
be
presently
call
into
the
parlour
,
where
the
pedlar
repeat
the
same
story
he
have
tell
before
,
and
insist
on
the
truth
of
every
circumstance
;
so
that
all
who
hear
him
be
extremely
well
satisfied
of
the
truth
,
except
Pamela
,
who
imagine
,
as
she
have
never
hear
either
of
her
parent
mention
such
an
accident
,
that
it
must
be
certainly
false
;
and
except
the
Lady
Booby
,
who
suspect
the
falsehood
of
the
story
from
her
ardent
desire
that
it
should
be
true
;

Joseph

who
fear
its
truth

from
his
earnest
wish

prove
false

Mr

now
desire

absolute
belief

next
morning

when
he
expect
old
Mr

and
Pamela
home
in
his
coach
,
and
then
they
may
be
certain
of
certainly
know
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
this
relation
;
in
which
,
he
say
,
as
there
be
many
strong
circumstance
to
induce
their
credit

so
he
could
not
perceive
any
interest

a

Booby
have
prevail
on
Joseph
to
ask
Mr
Didapper
's
pardon
,
with
which
he
be
perfectly
satisfied
.
<EOS>
many
joke
pass
between
the
beau
and
the
parson
,
chiefly
on
each
other
's
dress
;
these
afford
much
diversion
to
the
company
.
<EOS>
Pamela
chid
her
brother
Joseph
for
the
concern
which
he
exprest
at
discover
a
new
sister
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
if
he
love
Fanny
as
he
ought
,
with
a
pure
affection
,
he
have
no
reason
to
lament
be
relate
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
upon
which
Adams
begin
to
discourse
on
platonic
love
;
whence
he
make
a
quick
transition
to
the
joy
in
the
next
world
,
and
conclude
with
strongly
assert
that
there
be
no
such
thing
as
pleasure
in
this
.
<EOS>
at
which
Pamela
and
her
husband
smile
on
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
this
happy
pair
propose
to
retire
(
for
no
other
person
give
the
least
symptom
of
desire
rest
)
,
they
all
repair
to
several
bed
provide
for
them
in
the
same
house
;
nor
be
Adams
himself
suffer
to
go
home
,
it
be
a
stormy
night
.
<EOS>
Fanny
indeed
often
beg
she
may
go
home
with
the
parson
;
but
her
stay
be
so
strongly
insist
on
,
that
she
at
last
,
by
Joseph
's
advice
,
consent
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
contain
several
curious
night
-
adventure
,
in
which
Mr
Adams
fall
into
many
hair
-
breadth
"
scape
,
partly
owe
to
his
goodness
,
and
partly
to
his
inadvertency
.
  
<EOS>
about
an
hour
after
they
have
all
separate
(
it
be
now
past
three
in
the
morning
)
,
beau
Didapper
,
whose
passion
for
Fanny
permit
him
not
to
close
his
eye
,
but
have
employ
his
imagination
in
contrivance
how
to
satisfy
his
desire
,
at
last
hit
on
a
method
by
which
he
hope
to
effect
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
order
his
servant
to
bring
him
word
where
Fanny
lie
,
and
have
receive
his
information
;
he
therefore
arise
,
put
on
his
breech
and
nightgown
,
and
steal
softly
along
the
gallery
which
lead
to
her
apartment
;
and
,
be
come
to
the
door
,
as
he
imagine
it
,
he
open
it
with
the
least
noise
possible
and
enter
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
a
savour
now
invade
his
nostril
which
he
do
not
expect
in
the
room
of
so
sweet
a
young
creature
,
and
which
may
have
probably
have
no
good
effect
on
a
cooler
lover
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
grope
out
the
bed
with
difficulty
,
for
there
be
not
a
glimpse
of
light
,
and
,
open
the
curtain
,
he
whisper
in
Joseph
's
voice
<EOS>
(
for
he
be
an
excellent
mimic
)
,
"
<EOS>
Fanny
,
my
angel
!
<EOS>
I
be
come
to
inform
thee
that
I
have
discover
the
falsehood
of
the
story
we
last
night
hear
.
<EOS>
I
be
no
longer
thy
brother
,
but
the
lover
;
nor
will
I
be
delay
the
enjoyment
of
thee
one
moment
longer
.
<EOS>
You
have
sufficient
assurance
of
my
constancy
not
to
doubt
my
marry
you
,
and
it
would
be
want
of
love
to
deny
me
the
possession
of
thy
charm
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
disencumber
himself
from
the
little
clothe
he
have
on
,
and
,
leap
into
bed
,
embrace
his
angel
,
as
he
conceive
her
,
with
great
rapture
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
surprize
at
receive
no
answer
,
he
be
no
less
pleased
to
find
his
hug
return
with
equal
ardour
.
<EOS>
He
remain
not
long
in
this
sweet
confusion
;
for
both
he
and
his
paramour
presently
discover
their
error
.
<EOS>
indeed
it
be
no
other
than
the
accomplished
Slipslop
whom
he
have
engage
;
but
,
though
she
immediately
know
the
person
whom
she
have
mistake
for
Joseph
,
he
be
at
a
loss
to
guess
at
the
representative
of
Fanny
.
<EOS>
He
have
so
little
see
or
take
notice
of
this
gentlewoman
,
that
light
itself
would
have
afford
him
no
assistance
in
his
conjecture
.
<EOS>
Beau
Didapper
no
sooner
have
perceive
his
mistake
than
he
attempt
to
escape
from
the
bed
with
much
great
haste
than
he
have
make
to
it
;
but
the
watchful
Slipslop
prevent
him
.
<EOS>
for
that
prudent
woman
,
be
disappoint
of
those
delicious
offering
which
her
fancy
have
promise
her
pleasure
,
resolve
to
make
an
immediate
sacrifice
to
her
virtue
.
<EOS>
indeed
she
want
an
opportunity
to
heal
some
wound
,
which
her
late
conduct
have
,
she
fear
,
give
her
reputation
;
and
,
as
she
have
a
wonderful
presence
of
mind
,
she
conceive
the
person
of
the
unfortunate
beau
to
be
luckily
throw
in
her
way
to
restore
her
lady
's
opinion
of
her
impregnable
chastity
.
<EOS>
at
that
instant
,
therefore
,
when
he
offer
to
leap
from
the
bed
,
she
catch
fast
hold
of
his
shirt
,
at
the
same
time
roar
out
,
"
o
thou
villain
!
<EOS>
who
hast
attack
my
chastity
,
and
,
I
believe
,
ruin
me
in
my
sleep
;
I
will
swear
a
rape
against
thee
,
I
will
prosecute
thee
with
the
utmost
vengeance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
beau
attempt
to
get
loose
,
but
she
hold
him
fast
,
and
when
he
struggle
she
cry
out
"
murder
!
<EOS>
murder
!
<EOS>
rape
!
<EOS>
robbery
!
<EOS>
ruin
!
<EOS>
"
at
which
word
,
parson
Adams
,
who
lie
in
the
next
chamber
,
wakeful
,
and
meditate
on
the
pedlar
's
discovery
,
jump
out
of
bed
,
and
,
without
stay
to
put
a
rag
of
clothe
on
,
hasten
into
the
apartment
whence
the
cry
proceed
.
<EOS>
He
make
directly
to
the
bed
in
the
dark
,
where
,
lay
hold
of
the
beau
's
skin
(
for
Slipslop
have
tear
his
shirt
almost
off
)
,
and
find
his
skin
extremely
soft
,
and
hear
him
in
a
low
voice
beg
Slipslop
to
let
him
go
,
he
no
longer
doubt
but
this
be
the
young
woman
in
danger
of
ravish
,
and
immediately
fall
on
the
bed
,
and
lay
hold
on
Slipslop
's
chin
,
where
he
find
a
rough
beard
,
his
belief
be
confirm
;
he
therefore
rescue
the
beau
,
who
presently
make
his
escape
,
and
then
,
turn
towards
Slipslop
,
receive
such
a
cuff
on
his
chop
,
that
,
his
wrath
kindle
instantly
,
he
offer
to
return
the
favour
so
stoutly
,
that
have
poor
Slipslop
receive
the
fist
,
which
in
the
dark
pass
by
her
and
fall
on
the
pillow
,
she
would
most
probably
have
give
up
the
ghost
.
<EOS>
Adams
,
miss
his
blow
,
fall
directly
on
Slipslop
,
who
cuff
and
scratch
as
well
as
she
could
;
nor
be
he
behindhand
with
her
in
his
endeavour
,
but
happily
the
darkness
of
the
night
befriend
her
.
<EOS>
She
then
cry
she
be
a
woman
;
but
Adams
answer
,
she
be
rather
the
devil
,
and
if
she
be
he
would
grapple
with
him
;
and
,
be
again
irritate
by
another
stroke
on
his
chop
,
he
give
her
such
a
remembrance
in
the
gut
,
that
she
begin
to
roar
loud
enough
to
be
hear
all
over
the
house
.
<EOS>
Adams
then
,
seize
her
by
the
hair
(
for
her
double
-
clout
have
fall
off
in
the
scuffle
)
,
pin
her
head
down
to
the
bolster
,
and
then
both
call
for
light
together
.
<EOS>
the
Lady
Booby
,
who
be
as
wakeful
as
any
of
her
guest
,
have
be
alarm
from
the
beginning
;
and
,
be
a
woman
of
a
bold
spirit
,
she
slipt
on
a
nightgown
,
petticoat
,
and
slipper
,
and
take
a
candle
,
which
always
burn
in
her
chamber
,
in
her
hand
,
she
walk
undauntedly
to
Slipslop
's
room
;
where
she
enter
just
at
the
instant
as
Adams
have
discover
,
by
the
two
mountain
which
Slipslop
carry
before
her
,
that
he
be
concerned
with
a
female
.
<EOS>
He
then
conclude
her
to
be
a
witch
,
and
say
he
fancy
those
breast
give
suck
to
a
legion
of
devil
.
<EOS>
slipslop
,
see
Lady
Booby
enter
the
room
,
cry
help
!
<EOS>
or
I
be
ravish
,
with
a
most
audible
voice
:
and
Adams
,
perceive
the
light
,
turn
hastily
,
and
see
the
lady
(
as
she
do
him
)
just
as
she
come
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
;
nor
do
her
modesty
,
when
she
find
the
naked
condition
of
Adams
,
suffer
her
to
approach
farther
.
<EOS>
She
then
begin
to
revile
the
parson
as
the
wickedest
of
all
man
,
and
particularly
rail
at
his
impudence
in
chuse
her
house
for
the
scene
of
his
debauchery
,
and
her
own
woman
for
the
object
of
his
bestiality
.
<EOS>
Poor
Adams
have
before
discover
the
countenance
of
his
bedfellow
,
and
,
now
first
recollect
he
be
naked
,
he
be
no
less
confounded
than
Lady
Booby
herself
,
and
immediately
whipt
under
the
bedclothe
,
whence
the
chaste
Slipslop
endeavour
in
vain
to
shut
him
out
.
<EOS>
then
put
forth
his
head
,
on
which
,
by
way
of
ornament
,
he
wear
a
flannel
nightcap
,
he
protest
his
innocence
,
and
ask
ten
thousand
pardon
of
Mrs
Slipslop
for
the
blow
he
have
strike
her
,
vow
he
have
mistake
her
for
a
witch
.
<EOS>
Lady
Booby
,
then
cast
her
eye
on
the
ground
,
observe
something
sparkle
with
great
lustre
,
which
,
when
she
have
take
it
up
,
appear
to
be
a
very
fine
pair
of
diamond
button
for
the
sleeve
.
<EOS>
a
little
farther
<EOS>
she
see
lie
the
sleeve
itself
of
a
shirt
with
laced
ruffle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Heyday
!
<EOS>
"
say
she
,
"
what
be
the
meaning
of
this
?
"
<EOS>
"
o
,
madam
,
"
say
Slipslop
,
"
I
do
not
know
what
hath
happen
,
I
have
be
so
terrified
.
<EOS>
here
may
have
be
a
dozen
man
in
the
room
.
"
<EOS>
"
to
whom
belong
this
laced
shirt
and
jewel
?
"
say
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
undoubtedly
,
"
cry
the
parson
,
"
to
the
young
gentleman
whom
I
mistake
for
a
woman
on
come
into
the
room
,
whence
proceed
all
the
subsequent
mistake
;
for
if
I
have
suspect
him
for
a
man
,
I
would
have
seize
him
,
have
he
be
another
Hercules
,
though
,
indeed
,
he
seem
rather
to
resemble
Hylas
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
give
an
account
of
the
reason
of
his
rise
from
bed
,
and
the
rest
,
till
the
lady
come
into
the
room
;
at
which
,
and
the
figure
of
Slipslop
and
her
gallant
,
whose
head
only
be
visible
at
the
opposite
corner
of
the
bed
,
she
could
not
refrain
from
laughter
;
nor
do
Slipslop
persist
in
accuse
the
parson
of
any
motion
towards
a
rape
.
<EOS>
the
lady
therefore
desire
him
to
return
to
his
bed
as
soon
as
she
be
depart
,
and
then
order
Slipslop
to
rise
and
attend
her
in
her
own
room
,
she
return
herself
thither
.
<EOS>
when
she
be
go
,
Adams
renew
his
petition
for
pardon
to
Mrs
Slipslop
,
who
,
with
a
most
christian
temper
,
not
only
forgave
,
but
begin
to
move
with
much
courtesy
towards
him
,
which
he
take
as
a
hint
to
begin
,
immediately
quit
the
bed
,
and
make
the
good
of
his
way
towards
his
own
;
but
unluckily
,
instead
of
turn
to
the
right
,
he
turn
to
the
left
,
and
go
to
the
apartment
where
Fanny
lie
,
who
(
as
the
reader
may
remember
)
have
not
sleep
a
wink
the
precede
night
,
and
who
be
so
hagge
out
with
what
have
happen
to
her
in
the
day
,
that
,
notwithstanding
all
thought
of
her
Joseph
,
she
be
fall
into
so
profound
a
sleep
,
that
all
the
noise
in
the
adjoining
room
have
not
be
able
to
disturb
her
.
<EOS>
Adams
grope
out
the
bed
,
and
,
turn
the
clothe
down
softly
,
a
custom
Mrs
Adams
have
long
accustom
him
to
,
creep
in
,
and
deposit
his
carcase
on
the
bed
-
post
,
a
place
which
that
good
woman
have
always
assign
him
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
cat
or
lap
-
dog
of
some
lovely
nymph
,
for
whom
ten
thousand
lover
languish
,
lie
quietly
by
the
side
of
the
charming
maid
,
and
,
ignorant
of
the
scene
of
delight
on
which
they
repose
,
meditate
the
future
capture
of
a
mouse
,
or
surprisal
of
a
plate
of
bread
and
butter
:
<EOS>
so
Adams
lie
by
the
side
of
Fanny
,
ignorant
of
the
paradise
to
which
he
be
so
near
;
nor
could
the
emanation
of
sweet
which
flow
from
her
breath
overpower
the
fume
of
tobacco
which
play
in
the
parson
's
nostril
.
<EOS>
and
now
sleep
have
not
overtake
the
good
man
,
when
Joseph
,
who
have
secretly
appoint
Fanny
to
come
to
her
at
the
break
of
day
,
rap
softly
at
the
chamber
-
door
,
which
when
he
have
repeat
twice
,
Adams
cry
,
"
come
in
,
whoever
you
be
.
"
<EOS>
Joseph
think
he
have
mistake
the
door
,
though
she
have
give
him
the
most
exact
direction
;
however
,
know
his
friend
's
voice
,
he
open
it
,
and
see
some
female
vestment
lie
on
a
chair
.
<EOS>
Fanny
wake
at
the
same
instant
,
and
stretch
out
her
hand
on
Adams
's
beard
,
she
cry
out
,
 
"
o
heaven
!
<EOS>
where
be
I
?
"
<EOS>
"
bless
me
!
<EOS>
where
be
I
?
"
say
the
parson
.
<EOS>
then
Fanny
scream
,
Adams
leapt
out
of
bed
,
and
Joseph
stand
,
as
the
tragedians
call
it
,
like
the
statue
of
Surprize
.
<EOS>
"
how
come
she
into
my
room
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Adams
.
<EOS>
"
how
come
you
into
hers
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Joseph
,
in
an
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
of
the
matter
,
"
answer
Adams
,
"
but
that
she
be
a
vestal
for
me
.
<EOS>
as
I
be
a
Christian
,
I
know
not
whether
she
be
a
man
or
woman
.
<EOS>
He
be
an
infidel
who
doth
not
believe
in
witchcraft
.
<EOS>
They
as
surely
exist
now
as
in
the
day
of
Saul
.
<EOS>
My
clothe
be
bewitch
away
too
,
and
Fanny
's
bring
into
their
place
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
he
still
insist
he
be
in
his
own
apartment
;
but
Fanny
deny
it
vehemently
,
and
say
his
attempt
to
persuade
Joseph
of
such
a
falsehood
convince
her
of
his
wicked
design
.
<EOS>
"
how
!
"
say
Joseph
in
a
rage
,
"
hath
he
offer
any
rudeness
to
you
?
"
<EOS>
She
answer
 
She
could
not
accuse
him
of
any
more

<EOS>
Joseph
's
great
opinion
of
Adams
be
not
easily
to
be
stagger
,
and
when
he
hear
from
Fanny
that
no
harm
have
happen
he
grow
a
little
cooler
;
yet
still
he
be
confound
,
and
,
as
he
know
the
house
,
and
that
the
woman
's
apartment
be
on
this
side
Mrs
Slipslop
's
room
,
and
the
man
's
on
the
other
,
he
be
convince
that
he
be
in
Fanny
's
chamber
.
<EOS>
Assuring
Adams
therefore
of
this
truth
,
he
beg
him
to
give
some
account
how
he
come
there
.
<EOS>
Adams
then
,
stand
in

which
do
not
offend
Fanny

as
the
curtain
of

all
that
have
happen
;
and
when
he
have
end
Joseph
tell
him
,
 
<EOS>
It
be
plain
he
have
mistake
by
turn
to
the
right
instead
of
the
left

<EOS>
"
odso
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Adams
,
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
:
as
sure
as
sixpence
,
you
have
hit
on
the
very

"
<EOS>
He
then
traverse
the
room
,
rub
his
hand
,
and
beg
Fanny
's
pardon
,
assure
her
he
do
not
know
whether
she
be
man
or
woman
.
<EOS>
that
innocent
creature
firmly
believe
all
he
say
,
tell
him
she
be
no
longer
angry
,
and
beg
Joseph
to
conduct
him
into
his
own
apartment
,
where
he
should
stay
himself
till
she
have
put
her
clothe
on
.
<EOS>
Joseph
and
Adams
accordingly
depart
,
and
the
latter
soon
be
convince
of
the
mistake
he
have
commit
;
however
,
whilst
he
be
dress
himself
,
he
often
assert
he
believe
in
the
power
of
witchcraft
notwithstanding

and
do
not
see
how
a
Christian
could
deny
it

<EOS>
the
arrival
of
Gaffar
and
Gammar
Andrews

with
another
person
not

and
a
perfect
solution
of
the
difficulty

by
the
pedlar

<EOS>
as
soon
as
Fanny
be
dr
Joseph
return
to
her
,
and
they
have
a
long
conversation
together
,
the
conclusion
of
which
be
,
that
,
if
they
find
themselves
to
be
really
brother
and
sister
,
they
vow
a
perpetual
celibacy
,
and
to
live
together
all
their

and
indulge
a
platonic
friendship
for
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
the
company
be
all
very
merry
at
breakfast

and

which
the
beau

readily

very
subject

his
sleep
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
be
far
from
be
ashamed
of
his
amour
,
and
rather
endeavour
to
insinuate
that
more
than
be
really
true
have
pass
between
him
and
the
fair
Slipslop
.
  
<EOS>
Their
tea
be
scarce
over

They

Lady
Booby
,
whose
heart
go
now
pit
-
a

pat
,
as
do
those
of
Joseph
and
Fanny
.
<EOS>
They
feel
,
perhaps
,
little
less
anxiety
in
this
interval
than
Oedipus

,
whilst
his
fate
be
reveal
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Booby
first
open
the
cause
by
inform

<EOS>
these
word
be
a
cordial

but
have
a
different
effect
on
Lady

.
<EOS>
She
order
the
pedlar
to
be
call

who
recount
his
story
as

<EOS>
at

"
<EOS>
the
company
be
all
amazed
at
this
disagreement
between
the
man
and
his
wife
;
and
the
blood
have
now
forsake
the
cheek
of
the
lover
,
when
the
old
woman
,
turn
to
her
husband
,
who
be
more
surprized
than
all
the
rest
,
and
have
a
little
recover
her
own
spirit
,
deliver
herself
as
follow
<EOS>
:
"
You
may
remember
,
my
dear
,
when
you
go
a
serjeant
to
Gibraltar
,
you
leave
me
big
with
child
;
you
stay
abroad
,
you
know
,
upwards
of
three
year

<EOS>
in
your
absence
I
be
bring
to
bed
,
I
verily
believe
,
of
this
daughter
,
whom
I
be
sure
I
have
reason
to
remember
,
for
I
suckle
her
at
this
very
breast
till
the
day
she
be
steal
from
me
.
<EOS>
one
afternoon
,
when
the
child
be
about
a
year
,
or
a
year
and
a
half
old
,
or
thereabout
,
two
gypsy

offer
to
tell
my
fortune

<EOS>
one
of
them
have
a
child
in
her
lap

<EOS>
I
show
them
my
hand
,
and
desire
to
know
if
you
be
ever
to
come
home
again
,
which
I
remember
as
well
as
if
it
be
but
yesterday

they
faithfully
promise
me
you
should

<EOS>
I
leave
the
girl
in
the
cradle

go
to
draw
them
a
cup
of
liquor

<EOS>
the
good
I
have
:
when
I
return
with
the
pot
(
I

I

not

longer
than
whilst
I
be
tell
it
to
you

the
woman

<EOS>
I
be
afraid
they
have
steal
something
,
and
look
and
look
,
but
to
no
purpose
,
and
,
Heaven
know
,
I
have
very
little
for
them
to
steal
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
hear
the
child
cry
in
the
cradle
,
I
go
to
take
it
up
 
<EOS>
but
,
o
the
living
!
<EOS>
how
be
I
surprize
to
find
,
instead
of
my
own
girl
that
I
have
put
into
the
cradle
,
who
be
as
fine
a
fat
thrive
child
as
you
shall
see
in
a
summer
's
day
,
a
poor
sickly
boy

that
do
not
seem
to
have
an
hour
to
live

<EOS>
I
run
out
,
pull
my
hair
off
and
cry
like
any
mad
after
the
woman
,
but
never
could
hear
a
word
of
them
from
that
day
to
this
.
<EOS>
when
I
come
back
the
poor
infant
(
which
be
our
Joseph
there
,
as
stout
as
he
now
stand
)
lift
up
its
eye
upon
me
so
piteously
,
that
,
to
be
sure
,
notwithstanding
my
passion
,
I
could
not
find
in
my
heart
to
do
it
any
mischief

<EOS>
a
neighbour
of
mine

happen
to
come
in
at
the
same
time
,
and
hear
the
case
,
advise
me
to
take
care
of
this
poor
child

and
God
would
perhaps
one
day
restore
me
my
own
.
<EOS>
upon
which
I
take
the
child
up
,
and
suckle
it
to
be
sure
,
all
the
world
as
if
it
have
be
bear
of
my

natural
body
;
and
as
true
as
I
be
alive
,
in
a
little
time
I
love
the
boy
all
to
nothing
as
if
it
have
be
my

<EOS>
well
,
as
I
be
say
,
time
grow
very
hard
,
I
have
two
child
and
nothing
but
my
own
work
,
which
be
little
enough
,
God
know
,
to
maintain
them
,
be
oblige
to
ask
relief
of
the
parish

but
,
instead
of
give
it
me
,
they
remove
me
,
by
justice

warrant
,
fifteen
mile
,
to
the
place

,
Joseph
,
I
say
,
seem
to
me
about
five
year
old
when
you
return

for
I
believe
he
be
two
or
three
year
old
than
our
daughter
here
<EOS>
(
for
I
be
thoroughly
convinced
she
be
the

;
and
when
you
see
him
you
say
he
be
a
chopping
boy
,
without
ever
mind
his
age
;
and
so
I
,
see
you
do
not

anything

I
may
e'en
as

keep
it
to

you

him
as
well

all
this
be
veritably
true

I

my

by
the
order

with
the
utmost
attention
to
Gammar
Andrews

story

and
,
when

have
finish

ask
her
if
the
supposititious
child
have
no
mark
on
its
breast

<EOS>
to

she
answer
,
"
yes

this

"
<EOS>
well

say
Gaffar
Andrews

who
be
a
comical
sly
old
fellow

very
likely
desire
to
have
no
more
child

he
could
keep

"
you
have
prove
,
I
think
,
very
plainly

that
this

doth
not
belong
to
us

how
be
you
certain
that
the
girl
be
ours

and
Joseph
both
so
insist
on
his
complying
,
that
he
at
last
consent
,
have
first
obtain
a
messenger
from
Mr
Booby
to
acquaint
his
wife
with
the
news
;
which
,
as
he
know
it
would
render
her
completely
happy
,
he
could
not
prevail
on
himself
to
delay
a
moment
in
acquaint
her
with
.
  
<EOS>
the
company
be
range
in
this
manner
:
the
two
old
people
,
with
their
two
daughter
,
ride
in
the
coach
;
the
squire
,
Mr
Wilson
,
Joseph
,
parson
Adams
,
and
the
pedlar
,
proceed
on
horseback
.
  
<EOS>
in
their
way
,
Joseph
inform
his
father
of
his
intended
match
with
Fanny
;
to
which
,
though
he
express
some
reluctance
at
first
,
on
the
eagerness
of
his
son
's
instance
he
consent
;
say
,
if
she
be
so
good
a
creature
as
she
appear
,
and
he
describe
her
<EOS>
,
he
think
the
disadvantage
of
birth
and
fortune
may
be
compensate
.
<EOS>
He
however
insist
on
the
match
be
defer
till
he
have
see
his
mother
;
in
which
,
Joseph
perceive
him
positive
,
with
great
duty
obey
him
,
to
the
great
delight
of
parson
Adams
,
who
by
these
mean
see
an
opportunity
of
fulfil
the
Church
form
,
and
marry
his
parishioner
without
a
licence
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Adams
,
greatly
exult
on
this
occasion
(
for
such
ceremony
be
matter
of
no
small
moment
with
him
)
,
accidentally
give
spur
to
his
horse
,
which
the
generous
beast
disdain
 
for
he
be
of
high
mettle
,
and
have
be
use
to
more
expert
rider
than
the
gentleman
who
at
present
bestrode
him
,
for
whose
horsemanship
he
have
perhaps
some
contempt
 
immediately
run
away
full
speed
,
and
play
so
many
antic
trick
that
he
tumble
the
parson
from
his
back
;
which
Joseph
perceiving
,
come
to
his
relief
.
  
<EOS>
this
accident
afford
infinite
merriment
to
the
servant
,
and
no
less
frighted
poor
Fanny
,
who
behold
him
as
he
pass
by
the
coach
;
but
the
mirth
of
the
one
and
terror
of
the
other
be
soon
determine
,
when
the
parson
declare
he
have
receive
no
damage
.
  
<EOS>
the
horse
have
free
himself
from
his
unworthy
rider
,
as
he
probably
think
him
,
proceed
to
make
the
good
of
his
way
;
but
be
stop
by
a
gentleman
and
his
servant
,
who
be
travel
the
opposite
way
,
and
be
now
at
a
little
distance
from
the
coach
.
<EOS>
They
soon
meet
;
and
as
one
of
the
servant
deliver
Adams
his
horse
,
his
master
hail
him
,
and
<EOS>
Adams
,
look
up
,
presently
recollect
he
be
the
justice
of
peace
before
whom
he
and
Fanny
have
make
their
appearance
.
<EOS>
the
parson
presently
salute
him
very
kindly
;
and
the
justice
inform
him
that
he
have
find
the
fellow
who
attempt
to
swear
against
him
and
the
young
woman
the
very
next
day
,
and
have
commit
him
to
Salisbury
gaol
,
where
he
be
charge
with
many
robbery
.
  
<EOS>
many
compliment
have
pass
between
the
parson
and
the
justice
<EOS>
,
the
latter
proceed
on
his
journey
;
and
the
former
,
have
with
some
disdain
refuse
Joseph
's
offer
of
change
horse
,
and
declare
he
be
as
able
a
horseman
as
any
in
the
kingdom
,
remount
his
beast
;
and
now
the
company
again
proceed
,
and
happily
arrive
at
their
journey
's
end
,
Mr
Adams
,
by
good
luck
,
rather
than
by
good
riding
,
escape
a
second
fall
.
  
<EOS>
the
company
,
arrive
at
Mr
Booby
's
house
,
be
all
receive
by
him
in
the
most
courteous
and
entertain
in
the
most
splendid
manner
,
after
the
custom
of
the
old
english
hospitality
,
which
be
still
preserve
in
some
very
few
family
in
the
remote
part
of
England
.
<EOS>
They
all
pass
that
day
with
the
utmost
satisfaction
;
it
be
perhaps
impossible
to
find
any
set
of
people
more
solidly
and
sincerely
happy
.
<EOS>
Joseph
and
Fanny
find
mean
to
be
alone
upward
of
two
hour
,
which
be
the
short
but
the
sweet
imaginable
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
morning
Mr
Wilson
propose
to
his
son
to
make
a
visit
with
him
to
his
mother
;
which
,
notwithstanding
his
dutiful
inclination
,
and
a
longing
desire
he
have
to
see
her
,
a
little
concerned
him
,
as
he
must
be
oblige
to
leave
his
Fanny
;
but
the
goodness
of
Mr
Booby
relieve
him
;
for
he
propose
to
send
his
own
coach
and
six
for
Mrs
Wilson
,
whom
Pamela
so
very
earnestly
invite
,
that
Mr
Wilson
at
length
agree
with
the
entreaty
of
Mr
Booby
and
Joseph
,
and
suffer
the
coach
to
go
empty
for
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
on
Saturday
night
the
coach
return
with
Mrs
Wilson
,
who
add
one
more
to
this
happy
assembly
.
<EOS>
the
reader
may
imagine
much
well
and
quicker
too
than
I
can
describe
the
many
embrace
and
tear
of
joy
which
succeed
her
arrival
.
<EOS>
It
be
sufficient
to
say
she
be
easily
prevail
with
to
follow
her
husband
's
example
in
consent
to
the
match
.
  
<EOS>
on
Sunday
Mr
Adams
perform
the
service
at
the
squire
's
parish
church
,
the
curate
of
which
very
kindly
exchange
duty
,
and
ride
twenty
mile
to
the
Lady
Booby
's
parish
so
to
do
;
be
particularly
charge
not
to
omit
publish
the
bann
,
be
the
third
and
last
time
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
the
happy
day
arrive
which
be
to
put
Joseph
in
the
possession
of
all
his
wish
.
<EOS>
He
arise
,
and
drest
himself
in
a
neat
but
plain
suit
of
Mr
Booby
's
,
which
exactly
fit
him
;
for
he
refuse
all
finery
;
as
do
Fanny
likewise
,
who
could
be
prevail
on
by
Pamela
to
attire
herself
in
nothing
rich
than
a
white
dimity
nightgown
.
<EOS>
Her
shift
indeed
,
which
Pamela
present
her
,
be
of
the
fine
kind
,
and
have
an
edging
of
lace
round
the
bosom
.
<EOS>
She
likewise
equip
her
with
a
pair
of
fine
white
thread
stocking
,
which
be
all
she
would
accept
;
for
she
wear
one
of
her
own
short
round
-
eared
cap
,
and
over
it
a
little
straw
hat
,
line
with
cherry
-
colour
silk
,
and
tie
with
a
cherry
-
coloured
ribbon
.
<EOS>
in
this
dress
she
come
forth
from
her
chamber
,
blush
and
breathe
sweet
;
and
be
by
Joseph
,
whose
eye
sparkle
fire
,
lead
to
church
,
the
whole
family
attend
,
where
Mr
Adams
perform
the
ceremony
;
at
which
nothing
be
so
remarkable
as
the
extraordinary
and
unaffected
modesty
of
Fanny
,
unless
the
true
christian
piety
of
Adams
,
who
publickly
rebuke
Mr
Booby
and
Pamela
for
laugh
in
<EOS>
so
sacred
a
place
,
and
on
so
solemn
an
occasion
.
<EOS>
Our
parson
would
have
do
no
less
to
the
high
prince
on
earth
;
for
,
though
he
pay
all
submission
and
deference
to
his
superior
in
other
matter
,
where
the
least
spice
of
religion
intervene
he
immediately
lose
all
respect
of
person
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
maxim
,
that
he
be
a
servant
of
the
high
,
and
could
not
,
without
depart
from
his
duty
,
give
up
the
least
article
of
his
honour
or
of
his
cause
to
the
great
earthly
potentate
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
always
assert
that
Mr
Adams
at
church
with
his
surplice
on
,
and
Mr
Adams
without
that
ornament
in
any
other
place
,
be
two
very
different
person
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
church
rite
be
over
Joseph
lead
his
blooming
bride
back
to
Mr
Booby
's
<EOS>
(
for
the
distance
be
so
very
little
<EOS>
they
do
not
think
proper
to
use
a
coach
)
;
the
whole
company
attend
them
likewise
on
foot
;
and
now
a
most
magnificent
entertainment
be
provide
,
at
which
parson
Adams
demonstrate
an
appetite
surprizing
as
well
as
surpass
every
one
present
.
<EOS>
indeed
the
only
person
who
betray
any
deficiency
on
this
occasion
be
those
on
whose
account
the
feast
be
provide
.
<EOS>
They
pamper
their
imagination
with
the
much
more
exquisite
repast
which
the
approach
of
night
promise
them
;
the
thought
of
which
fill
both
their
mind
,
though
with
different
sensation
;
the
one
all
desire
,
while
the
other
have
her
wish
temper
with
fear
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
,
after
a
day
pass
with
the
utmost
merriment
,
correct
by
the
strict
decency
,
in
which
,
however
,
parson
Adams
,
be
well
fill
with
ale
and
pudding
,
have
give
a
loose
to
more
facetiousness
than
be
usual
to
him
,
<EOS>
the
happy
,
the
bl
moment
arrive
when
Fanny
retire
with
her
mother
,
her
mother
-
in
-
law
,
and
her
sister
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
soon
undrest
;
for
she
have
no
jewel
to
deposit
in
their
casket
,
nor
fine
lace
to
fold
with
the
nice
exactness
.
<EOS>
undress
to
her
be
properly
discover
,
not
put
off
,
ornament
;
for
,
as
all
her
charm
be
the
gift
of
nature
,
she
could
divest
herself
of
none
.
<EOS>
how
,
reader
,
shall
I
give
thee
an
adequate
idea
of
this
lovely
young
creature
?
<EOS>
the
bloom
of
rose
and
lily
may
a
little
illustrate
her
complexion
,
or
their
smell
her
sweetness
;
but
to
comprehend
her
entirely
,
conceive
youth
,
health
,
bloom
,
neatness
,
and
innocence
,
in
her
bridal
bed
;
conceive
all
these
in
their
utmost
perfection
,
and
you
may
place
the
charming
Fanny
's
picture
before
your
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Joseph
no
sooner
hear
she
be
in
bed
than
he
flee
with
the
utmost
eagerness
to
her
.
<EOS>
a
minute
carry
him
into
her
arm
,
where
we
shall
leave
this
happy
couple
to
enjoy
the
private
reward
of
their
constancy
;
reward
so
great
and
sweet
,
that
I
apprehend
Joseph
neither
envy
the
noble
duke
,
nor
Fanny
the
fine
duchess
,
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
the
third
day
Mr
Wilson
and
his
wife
,
with
their
son
and
daughter
,
return
home
;
where
they
now
live
together
in
a
state
of
bliss
scarce
ever
equal
.
<EOS>
Mr
Booby
hath
,
with
unprecedented
generosity
,
give
Fanny
a
fortune
of
two
thousand
pound
,
which
Joseph
hath
lay
out
in
a
little
estate
in
the
same
parish
with
his
father
,
which
he
now
occupy
(
his
father
have
stock
it
for
him
)
;
and
Fanny
preside
with
most
excellent
management
in
his
dairy
;
where
,
however
,
she
be
not
at
present
very
able
to
bustle
much
,
be
,
as
Mr
Wilson
inform
me
in
his
last
letter
,
extremely
big
with
her
first
child
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Booby
hath
present
Mr
Adams
with
a
living
of
one
hundred
and
thirty
pound
a
year
.
<EOS>
He
at
first
refuse
it
,
resolve
not
to
quit
his
parishioner
,
with
whom
he
have
live
so
long
;
but
,
on
recollect
he
may
keep
a
curate
at
this
living
,
he
hath
be
lately
induct
into
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
pedlar
,
besides
several
handsome
present
,
both
from
Mr
Wilson
and
Mr
Booby
,
be
,
by
the
latter
's
interest
,
make
an
exciseman
;
a
trust
which
he
discharge
with
such
justice
,
that
he
be
greatly
beloved
in
his
neighbourhood
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
the
Lady
Booby
,
she
return
to
London
in
a
few
day
,
where
a
young
captain
of
dragoon
,
together
with
eternal
party
at
card
,
soon
obliterate
the
memory
of
Joseph
.
  
<EOS>
Joseph
remain
bl
with
his
Fanny
,
whom
he
doat
on
with
the
utmost
tenderness
,
which
be
all
return
on
her
side
.
<EOS>
the
happiness
of
this
couple
be
a
perpetual
fountain
of
pleasure
to
their
fond
parent
;
and
,
what
be
particularly
remarkable
,
he
declare
he
will
imitate
them
in
their
retirement
,
nor
will
be
prevail
on
by
any
bookseller
,
or
their
author
,
to
make
his
appearance
in
high
life
.
