spot
than
this

not

amidst
the
whole

of

Downs
—
nor
one
command
more
delightful
view
.
<EOS>
look
at
it
and
judge
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
rounded
summit
of
a
hill
;
or
,
to
speak
with
great
precision
,
the
mid
-
summit
of
a
series
of
soft
bosomy
eminence
,
spring
from
a
hilly
ridge
,
that
trend
towards
the
coast
,
and
rise
and
fall
smoothly
and
gently
in
its
course
,
like
the
wave
of
a
slightly
agitated
sea
.
<EOS>
the
lovely
mount
be
cover
with
short
elastic
sward
,
redolent
of
thyme
and

british
barrow
,
on
the
bank
of
which
we
will
seat
ourselves
,
and
look
around
.
<EOS>
how
pleasing
be
the
prospect
!
<EOS>
how
fresh
the
air
that
visit
us
!
<EOS>
no
breeze
so
fine
and
invigorate
as
that
of
these
Sussex
down
;
no
turf
so
springy
to
the
foot
as
their
smooth
greensward
.
<EOS>
a
flock
of
lark
fly
past
us
,
and
a
cloud
of
mingled
rook
and
starling
wheel
overhead
.
<EOS>
Mark
yon
little

on
the
slope
below
us
—
those
be
the
snare
set
by
the
shepherd
for
the
delicious
wheatear
—
our
english
ortolan
.
<EOS>
the
fairy
still
haunt
this
spot
,
and
hold
their
midnight
revel
upon
it
,
as
yon
dark

green

why

we

not

<EOS>

,
the

<EOS>
a

soft

be
here
spread
out
for
Oberon
and
Titania
and
their
attendant
elf
to
dance
upon
by

;
and
there
be
no
lack
of
mushroom
to
form

for
Puck

<EOS>
own
that
no
hill
can
be
more
beautiful
than
these
South
Downs
.
<EOS>
They
may
want
height
,
boldness
,
grandeur
,
sublimity
;
they
possess
not
forest
,
rock
,
torrent
,
or
ravine
;
but
they
have
gentleness
,
softness
,
and
other
endearing
attribute
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
attempt
to
delineate
the
slight
but
infinite
variety
of
form
and
aspect
that
distinguish
one
hill
from
its
neighbour
;
for
though
a
strong
family

them
all
,
each

an
individual

high

exquisite

<EOS>
contemplation
of
such
a
scene
soothe
rather
than
excite

and
inspire
only
feeling
of
placid
enjoyment

<EOS>
We

for
no
violent
emotion
.
<EOS>
We
be
not
require
to
admire
Nature
in
her
wildest
and
most
savage
aspect
.
<EOS>
We
have
a
peaceful
landscape
before
us
,
of
a
primitive
character
,
and
possess
accompaniment
of
pastoral
life
.
<EOS>
yonder
be
the
shepherd
,
with
crook
and
dog
,
watch
his
flock
browse
on
the
thymy
slope
—
the
unequalled
sheep
of
the
South
Downs
,

<EOS>
at

with

of

and

on

and

large

on
the
other
,
where
the
ploughman
with
his
yoke
of
patient
oxen
be
at
work
.
<EOS>
in
this
valley
you
may
note
a
farm

shed
and
a
sheepfold
,
with
row
of
haystack
and

at

while
a
solitary
barn
form
a
landmark
on
that
distant
hill
.
<EOS>
altogether
,
a
charming
picture
.
<EOS>
but
we
have
not
yet
fully
examine
it
.
<EOS>
the
beauteous
hill
,
on
the
brow
of
which
we
be
seat
,
have
necessarily
a
valley
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
on
the
right
,
and
immediately
beneath
us
,
be
a
pretty
little
village
,
nestle
amid
a
grove
of
tree
,
above
whose
top
you
may
discern
the
tower
of
a
small
,
grey
old
church
.
<EOS>
with
this
village
we
trust
to
make
you
more
intimately
acquaint
by
-
and
-
by
.
<EOS>
It
be
Ovingdean
.
<EOS>
on
the
left
,
and
nearer
the
sea
,
you
may
discern
another
,
and
considerably
large
village
than
Ovingdean
,
almost
as
picturesque
as
the
latter
,
and
possess
a
grey
,
antique
church
at
its
northern
extremity
.
<EOS>
this
second

<EOS>

be
where
we

across
the
valley
,
up

then

for

behold

in

exquisite

but
at
time
they
have
a
graver
aspect
.
<EOS>
at
shudder
dawn
,
or
at
the
midnight
hour
,
they
have
a
solemn
and
mysterious
look
,
and
seem
,
like
the
Sphynx
,
to
mutter
secret
of
the
Past
.
<EOS>
of
most
other
place
in
the
land
the
ancient
feature
be
change
,
disfigure
,
or
wholly
obliterated
;
but
the
old
visage
of
the
Sussex
Downs
be
unaltered
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
same
as
when
the
Celtic
Britons
hold
their
funeral
ceremony
on
this
green
mount
;
as
when
the
warlike
Romans
make
their
camp
upon
yonder
neighbouring
hill
;
as
when
our
Saxon
ancestor
dwelt
in
those
seclude
valley
,
and
give
name
to
them
which
we
still
retain
.
<EOS>
what
wonder
that
such
ancient
hill
—
ancient
,
but
endow
with
perpetual
youth
—
should
sometimes
discourse
of
the
great
people
they
have
know
!
<EOS>
what
wonder
when
the
scene
be
the
same
that
the
shade
of
the
mighty
depart
should
sometimes
revisit
the
theatre
of
their
earthly
actions!before
quit
our
seat
on
this
old
tumulus
,
let
us
hear
what
delightful
Gilbert
White
have
to
say
about
the
district
:
"
though
I
have
now
travel
the
Sussex
Downs
upwards
of
thirty
year
,
"
write
this
charming
natural
historian
,
"
yet
I
still
investigate
that
chain
of
majestic
mountain
with
fresh
admiration
year
by
year
,
and
think
I
see
new
beauty
every
time
I
traverse
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Ray
be
so
ravish
with
the
prospect
from
Plumpton
Plain
near
Lewes
,
that
he
mention
those
scene
in
his
'
wisdom
of
God
in
the
work
of
Creation
'
with
the
utmost
satisfaction
,
and
think
them
equal
to
anything
he
have
see
in
the
fine
part
of
Europe
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
think
there
be
something
peculiarly
sweet
and
amusing
in
the
shapely
figure
aspect
of
chalk
hill
in
preference
to
those
of
stone
,
which
be
rugged
,
broken
,
abrupt
,
and
shapeless
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
may
be
singular
in
my
opinion
,
and
not
so
happy
as
to
convey
to
you
the
same
idea
;
but
I
never
contemplate
these
mountain
without
think
I
perceive
somewhat
analogous
to
growth
in
their
gentle
swelling
and
smooth
fungus
-
like
protuberance
,
their
flute
side
,
and
regular
hollow
and
slope
,
that
carry
at
once
the
air
of
vegetative
dilatation
and
expansion
.
<EOS>
or
,
be
there
ever
a
time
when
these
immense
masse
of
calcareous
matter
be
throw
into
fermentation
by
some
adventitious
moisture
;
be
raise
and
leaven
into
such
shape
by
some
plastic
power
;
and
so
make
to
swell
and
heave
their
broad
back
into
the
sky
so
much
above
the
less
animated
clay
of
the
wild
below?”With
all
our
admiration
of
the
amiable
author
of
the
"
natural
history
of
Selborne
,
"
we
be
not
dispose
to
regard
our
South
Downs
in
the
light
of
vegetable
production
or
chemical
fermentation
;
but
we
leave
the
solution
of
the
question
to
the
geologist
.
<EOS>
and
now
let
us
descend
to
Ovingdean
,
which
lie
at
our
foot

slight

to
our

which
,
notwithstanding
its
contiguity
to

still
quite

one
important

Ovingdean

—

<EOS>
in
one
respect
,
and
that
by
no

an
immaterial
one

the
exist

far
surpass
its
predecessor

namely
,
in
the
magnitude
and

arrangement
of
its
farmyard
,
as
well
as
in
the
number
of
its
barn

all
of
which
be

<EOS>
but
as
it
be
with
the
ancient
house
that
we
have
now
to
do

we
must
endeavour

some
notion

feeling
inspire

within
these
hallowed
precinct
be
lessen
by
an
entrance
into
the

edifice
itself
;
for
there
,
if
you
love
simplicity
,
you
shall
find
it
;
there
you
shall
behold
a
primitive
little
village
church
,
without
ornament
,
yet
possess
the
rich
ornament
in
the
absence
of
all
decorative
artifice
;

the
grace
of
ecclesiastical
architecture
as
display
in
the
rounded
arch

its
nave

elsewhere
in

there

nothing
shall
disturb
your

there

you
shall
find
a
rustic
congregation

shall
listen
to
rustic
voice
chant
the
holy
hymn
;
and
above
all
,
you
shall
hear
<EOS>
our
Church

noble
service
well

worthily
perform

and
shall
have
good
ghostly
council
from

<EOS>
though
suffice
for
the
thinly

people
parish
in
which

the
dimension
of
Ovingdean
church
be
modest
enough
,
the
nave

be
little

stout

the
low
square
western
tower

from

serve
the
joint
purpose
of
vestiary
and
belfry
.
<EOS>
We
should
prefer
the
true
colour
of
the
stone
and
timber
to
whitewash
,
but
the
latter
,
at
all
event
,
be
clean

cheerful

the

<EOS>
over
the

separate
the

all

I

give
you

<EOS>
together
with
this
verse
from

well

"
this
shall
be
my
rest
forever
<EOS>
:
here
will
I
dwell

for
I
have
a
delight
therein

<EOS>
”but
<EOS>
though
we
love
the
old
pile
,
we
must
not
linger
within
it
too
long
,
but
go
forth
into
its
quiet
churchyard
,
now
bask
in
sunshine
,
and
visit
by
the
sweet
and
delicate
air
of
the
down

<EOS>
if
there
be
a
gleam
of
sunshine
in
the
sky

it
seem
to
seek
out
this
favour
spot
;
while
,
when
the
rain
descend
here
,
it
fall
gently
as
the

<EOS>
Would
you

out

two

<EOS>
you

gnarl

corrugated

fantastically

have

little

be
deservedly
spare

<EOS>
where

<EOS>
this
excellent

save
that
he
be
a
firm

consistent
supporter
of

and
a

maintainer
of
its

,
be
deprive

drive
from
his

,
and
no

permit
to
exercise
his
sacred
function
within
those

his

so
often

<EOS>
the
Reverend
Ardingly
Beard
,
for
so

this
sufferer
in
a
good

bore
his

but
he
cease

deplore
the
fall
state
of
the
Church

now
become
a
prey
to
raven
wolf

<EOS>
when
condemn
as
an
obstinate
and
incurable
prelatist
and
malignant
,
and
dispossess
of
his
church
and
living

he
have
the
additional
grief
and
mortification
of
find
his
place
occupy
by
the
Reverend
Master
Increase
Micklegift
(
as
the
latter
choose
to
style
himself
,
though
his
real
name
be
Zaccheus
Stonegall
)
,
an
Independent
minister
,
and
a
zealous
expounder
of
his
own
doctrine
,
but
whom
Mr.
Beard
regard
as
a
hypocrite
,
and
highly
dangerous
to
the
spiritual
welfare
of
his
somewhile
flock
.
<EOS>
but
the
deprive

not
retire
altogether
from

He

Colonel
Wolston

<EOS>
for
many
year
a
widower

the

have
find
solace
in
the
companionship
and
affectionate
attention
of
the
only
child

him
,
his
daughter
Dulcia

<EOS>
at
the
time
of
his
suspension
from
his
religious
function

which
unhappy
event
occur
about
four
year
before

date
of

<EOS>
Dulcia
Beard
have
just
reach
her
fifteenth
spring
,
and
though
she
feel
the
blow
at
the
moment
with
as
much
acuteness
as
her
father
,
yet
with
the
happy
elasticity
of
youth
she
speedily
shake
off
its
effect
,
and
regain
her
wonted
buoyancy
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
in
sooth
,
there
be
not
much
to
make
her
regret
the
change
of
abode
.
<EOS>
apartment

to
her
father
and
herself
at
the
Grange

where
they
may
dwell
as
retire
as
they
please
,
and
in
order
to
remove
any
sense
of
dependence
on
the
part
of
his
reverend
guest
,
Colonel
Maunsel
appoint
him
to
the
office
of
his
domestic
chaplain
.
<EOS>
thus
,
though
forbid
,
under
the
penalty
of
fine
and
imprisonment
,
to
preach
to
his
somewhile
flock
in
public
,
or
even
to
perform
the

covertly

our
good

address
in
private
such

be
not
backslider
or
apostate
,
and
prevent
them
from
waver
in
the
true
faith

<EOS>
greatly
beholden

therefore
,
do
the
worthy
man
feel
to
him
who
,
under
Providence

afford
an
asylum
fraught
with
so
many
advantage

<EOS>
in

merit
her
father
’s
love

<EOS>
a

sweet

<EOS>
impossible

the
candour

clear

earnest
eye
.
<EOS>
equally
impossible
to
misunderstand
the
serenity
of
her
marble
brow
,
or
the
composure
of
her
classic
countenance

<EOS>
Calm
be
her
countenance
,
but
not
cold
;
classic
be
her
feature
in
form
,
but
with
nothing
rigorous
in
their
outline

<EOS>
if

the
very
reverse
of
a
modish
gentlewoman
be
Dulcia
Beard

and
owe
none

her
attraction
to
art

<EOS>
whether
any
other
image
beside
that
of
her
father
have
find
a
place
within
that
gentle
bosom

will
be

as
we
proceed
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Wolston
Maunsel
of
Ovingdean
Grange
have
be
describe
as
a
Royalist
,
but
his
description
of
himself
,
"
that
he
be
a
Cavalier

would
be
more
correct

Colonel

Roundheads
and
the
whole
republican
party
,
civil

military

as
he
hate
poison

but
if
he
have
a
special
object
of
aversion
it
be
Noll
Cromwell
.
<EOS>
the
execution
of
Charles

the

animosity
towards
the
regicide

and
after
the
direful
tragedy
of
Whitehall

he
assume
a
mourning

vow
never

off

<EOS>
though

dispose
to

on

deem
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
abandon
a
home
he
delight
in

together
with
a

<EOS>
for
several

and
share
in
the
victory
as
well
as
in
the
defeat
of
that
great

though
somewhat
rash
,
commander

<EOS>
He
fight
at
the
famous
battle
of
Edgehill
,
where
Rupert
’s
matchless
cavalry
do
such
signal
execution
upon
the
Parliamentarians

at
Lansdown
Hill

at

<EOS>
heavy

but
other
calamity

besides
defeat

loss
of

have
befall
the
unfortunate
Cavalier

<EOS>
during

who
inherit
all
his

principle
of
loyalty
,
and
hate
the
Republicans
as
heartily
as
his
father
,
would
have
follow
in
the
old
Cavalier
’s
footstep
;
but
when
Colonel
Maunsel
be
set
free
,
the
struggle
be
well
-
nigh
over
,
the
Royalist
party
be
crush
for
the
time

five

with
the
futile

fray
as

<EOS>
if
his
father
have
try
to
restrain
the
young
Cavalier

the
attempt
would
have
be
ineffectual
;
but
the
loyal
old

no
such

<EOS>
on
the
contrary

he

him
to
go

him
use
it
against

<EOS>
while

his
sole
grief

<EOS>
Hoary

he
stand
so
stiff

any
detail
of
that
fatal
engagement
,
when
the
hope
of
the
young
monarch
and
his
adherent
be
utterly
destroy
.
<EOS>
have
as
little
sympathy
as
the
Cavaliers
themselves
with
the
republican
army
and
its
victorious
general
,
it
be
no
pleasure
to
us
to
record
their
success
.
<EOS>
suffice
it
then
to
say
,
that
while
preparation
be
make
by
Charles
and
his
general
for
the
come
conflict
,
Clavering
exhibit
the
utmost
ardour
and
impatience
;
and
when
at
length
the
luckless
3rd
of
September
arrive
,
prove
himself
by
his
fiery
courage
,
and
perhaps
by
his
rashness
,
to
be
his
father
’s
son
.
<EOS>
some
intelligence
of
his
brave
doing
during
the
battle
have
be
receive
at
Ovingdean
Grange
,
but
what
become
of
him
afterwards
be
not
know
.
<EOS>
His
name
do
not
appear
amongst
the
list
of
the
slain
;
but
such
list
in
those
troublous
time
be
ever
imperfect
.
<EOS>
Wogan
’s
regiment
,
it
be
know
,
have
suffer
severely
in
cover
the
king
’s
retreat
;
and
what
so
probable
as
that
foolhardy
and
inexperienced
Clavering
have
fall
then
.
<EOS>
so
at
least
fear
his
father
.
<EOS>
so
fear
another
,
whose
gentle
heart
be
distract
by
doubt
and
anxiety
.
<EOS>
sad
presentiment
have
fill
Dulcia
’s
breast
when
young
Maunsel
,
full
of
martial
ardour
and
enthusiasm
for
his
cause
,
have
set
out
on
the
expedition
.
<EOS>
She
have
accompany
him
to
the
summit
of
the
down
overlook
the
neighbouring
town
of
Brightelmstone
,
then
give
little
promise
of
its
future
magnitude
and
importance
,
and
chiefly
noticeable
from
this
point
by
a
cluster
of
quaint
old
house
,
with
red
-
tile
roof
and
gable
,
group
around
the
ancient
church
on
the
hill
,
together
with
a
short
scatter
street
,
consist
mostly
of
cottage
and
mean
habitation
,
run
towards
the
sea:—she
have
accompany
him
,
we
say
,
to
this
point
,
and
after
a
tearful
parting
—
tearful
on
her
side
,
at
least
—
have
gaze
wistfully
after
him
till
he
gain
the
brow
of
the
opposite
hill
,
when
he
wave
a
farewell
with
the
scarf
she
have
embroider
for
him
,
and
disappear
from
view
.
<EOS>
have
he
disappear
for
ever
?
<EOS>
be
the
question
that
occupy
Dulcia
,
as
she
return
to
the
grange
with
her
attendant
,
Patty
Whinchat
.
<EOS>
very
beautiful
and
very
picturesque
do
the
old
house
appear
,
embosome
amidst
its
tree
,
and
with
the
old
church
adjoin
,
as
view
from
the
high
ground
she
be
traverse
,
but
she
look
not
towards
it
,
for
her
thought
be
wander
in
another
direction
.
<EOS>
Patty
,
a
lively
little
damsel
,
and
dispose
to
take
a
cheerful
view
of
thing
,
chatter
away
,
and
assure
her
mistress
that
Master
Clavering
would
soon
be
back
again
,
after
kill
all
the
roundhead
;
but
after
a
while
,
receive
neither
response
nor
other
encouragement
to
talk
,
she
become
silent
,
and
try
to
shed
a
few
tear
for
company
.
<EOS>
often
do
Dulcia
recur
to
this
parting
with
Clavering
,
and
never
without
revive
the
sad
foreboding
which
she
have
then
experience
.
<EOS>
these
,
however
,
be
vague
fear
,
and
easily
shake
off
.
<EOS>
but
when
she
hear
of
Worcester
’s
disastrous
fight
—
when
rumour
of
dreadful
slaughter
of
the
Royalists
reach
her
—
when
day
after
day
pass
,
and
no
tiding
come
of
Clavering
<EOS>
—
we
may
imagine
how
much
she
suffer
.
<EOS>
She
dread
to
receive
confirmation
of
her
bad
fear
,
and
yet
this
suspense
be
well
-
nigh
intolerable
.
<EOS>
by
day
a
pallid
image
with
stony
eye
be
ever
before
her
;
and
at
night
she
behold
the
same
figure
in
her
dream
,
stretch
like
a
blood
-
stain
corpse
upon
the
battle
-
plain
.
<EOS>
as
to
Colonel
Maunsel
,
though
anxiety
as
to
his
son
’s
fate
be
naturally
uppermost
in
his
bosom
,
the
consideration
of
what
he
deem
to
be
a
great
national
calamity
weigh
so
heavily
upon
him
,
as
in
some
degree
to
absorb
his
private
griefs
.
<EOS>
the
issue
of
the
battle
of
Worcester
he
deem
fatal
to
his
country
.
<EOS>
England
be
dishonour
;
its
glory
obscure
.
<EOS>
right
,
religion
,
loyalty
,
be
trample
under
foot
.
<EOS>
republicanism
be
clearly
in
the
ascendant
:
the
star
of
monarchy
,
which
have
shine
for
a
moment
with
its
accustomed
splendour
,
have
set
,
he
fear
,
for
ever
.
<EOS>
while
deplore
the
prostrate
condition
of
his
own
party
,
now
at
the
mercy
of
its
hate
opponent
,
he
feel
yet
more
acutely
the
terrible
jeopardy
in
which
the
head
of
that
party
be
place
.
<EOS>
what
have
become
of
Charles
,
after
the
conflict
on
which
he
have
stake
his
fortune
,
the
colonel
could
only
conjecture
.
<EOS>
but
he
feel
certain
that
the
royal
fugitive
have
as
yet
contrive
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
Charles
’s
capture
would
have
be
too
loudly
proclaim
not
to
be
quickly
know
throughout
the
realm
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
almost
equally
certain
that
the
young
king
be
yet
within
the
country
,
and
his
retreat
may
,
therefore
,
at
any
moment
be
discover
.
<EOS>
a
large
reward
be
offer
for
his
capture
;
and
the
penalty
of
high
treason
,
loss
of
life
and
forfeiture
of
estate
,
be
adjudge
to
such
as
should
harbour
him
,
or
aid
in
his
escape
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsell
be
well
aware
,
from
his
own
feeling
,
that
no
personal
risk
would
prevent
any
loyal
subject
from
assist
his
sovereign
;
but
he
naturally
dread
lest
the
reward
offer
by
the
council
of
state
may
tempt
some
sordid
knave
to
cause
Charles
’s
betrayal
.
<EOS>
all
these
consideration
sorely
perplex
and
grieve
the
old
Cavalier
’s
spirit
.
<EOS>
the
burden
of
his
anxiety
be
almost
great
than
he
could
bear
,
and
threaten
to
bow
him
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
He
begin
to
fear
that
the
messenger
who
bring
him
word
that
his
son
have
be
find
amongst
the
slain
,
would
tell
him
that
the
king
have
be
capture
.
<EOS>
such
tiding
,
doubly
calamitous
<EOS>
,
he
be
well
assured
,
would
prove
his
own
death

<EOS>
the

a
somewhat
pensive
expression
that
by
no
means
detract
from
their
loveliness
;
the
eye
be
magnificent

and
black

the

this
portrait

which
bear
the
date
1630
,
represent
Lady
Clemence
Maunsel
,
the
colonel

wife

and
when
gaze

her
bewitching

no

<EOS>
His

His

but
his
wound
and
after
suffering
have
stiffen
his
limb
,
afflict
him
with
rheumatic
pain
,
which
cause
him
to
move
with
difficulty
,
and
prevent
all
active
exertion
.
<EOS>
His
feature
be
finely
form
,
but
very
thin
,
his
complexion
dark
,
and
his
black
overhanging
eyebrow
and
keen
grey
eye
give
him
a
stern
and
austere
expression
.
<EOS>
His
habiliment
,
we

sable

his

resignation

<EOS>
His
garment
be
sombre
in
colour
,
like
those
of
the
colonel
,
but
of
a
coarser
fabric
.
<EOS>
little
more
need
be
say
of
the
worthy
pastor
,
except
that
,
as
his
eyesight
have
begin
to
fail
him
,
he
be
oblige
to
have
recourse
to
spectacle
.
<EOS>
Dulcia
Beard
have
already
be
describe
as
singularly
beautiful
,
but
sooth
to
say
,
if
her
anxiety
should
not
be
speedily
relieve
,
her
beauty
will
run
great
risk
of
be
materially
impair
.
<EOS>
already
,
her
cheek
have
lose
their
bloom
,
and
the
lustre
of
her
eye
be
sadly
dimmed
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
,
too
,
have
quite
lose
its
cheerfulness
and
she
heave
deep
and
frequent
sigh
.
<EOS>
Patty
Whinchat
,
her
handmaiden
,
be
in
despair
about
her
young
mistress
,
and
feel
certain
,
unless
Master
Clavering
should
come
back
,
and
quickly
too
,
that
she
will
break
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Patty
can
not
understand
why
Mistress
Dulcia
should
be
so
foolish
,
see
that
there
be
other
young
man
in
the
world
quite
as
handsome
as
Master
Clavering
,
but
there
be
no
use
reason
with
her
—
pine
away
she
undoubtedly
will
,
in
spite
of
all
that
can
be
say
.
<EOS>
by
degree
the
conversation
,
which
,
as
may
be
suppose
,
have
never

character
,
begin
to
flag
,
until
at
length
it
wholly
cease

<EOS>
Fain
would
Dulcia
have
withdraw
,
but
she
do
not
like
to
disturb
Colonel
Maunsel
,
who
remain
with
his
face
bury
in
his
hand
,
as

gloomy

<EOS>
after
a
long
pause
the
old
gentleman
rouse
himself
,
as

by
a
great
effort

and
for
a
moment
gaze
vacantly
at
his
companion
.
<EOS>
“I
crave
pardon

"
he
say
,
as
soon
as
he
have
collect
his
scatter
thought
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
forget
that
I
be
not
alone

but
you
will
excuse
me
.
<EOS>
in
truth
,
I
can
bear
this
state
of
suspense
no

,
and
intend
to
set
forth
for
Worcester
to-
morrow
,
and
ascertain

if
I

the

Mr.

”“Unfit

the
effort
may
kill
me
,
but
I
may
as
well
go
as
tarry
here
,
and
die
by
inch
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
will
take
counsel
of
one
who
can
best
guide
me
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
”“ay
,
take
counsel
of
Heaven
ere

”Thus
<EOS>
call
upon
,
the
young
maiden
instantly
fly
to
his
assistance
,
give
him
his
crutch
-
handle
stick

and
help
to
raise
him
from
his
seat

<EOS>
the
old
Cavalier
get
up
with
great
difficulty
,
and
his
rheumatic
pain
extort
a
groan
from
him

<EOS>
after
a
momentary
stoppage
he
move
on
in
the
direction
of
his
wife

portrait

halt
opposite

<EOS>
Dulcia
,
who
still

him
,
watch
his
proceeding
with
some
surprise
,
but
she
make
no
remark

<EOS>
the
colonel
gaze
wistfully
at
the
portrait
,
and
then
,
in
earnest
and
supplicate
tone
,
but
so
low
as
scarcely
to
be
audible
to
Dulcia
,
besought
his
dear
depart
wife

give
him
some
sign
by
which
he
may
know
whether

with
her
approval

to
fear

<EOS>
on
behold
his

the
colonel
utter
a
cry
,
and
shake
off
in
his
excitement
the
rigidity
of
his
limb

no

rush
towards
him
with
a
quickness

under

<EOS>
Dulcia
and
Mr.
Beard
follow
,
but
remain
stand
at
a
little
distance
,
unwilling
to
interrupt
the
meeting
between
father

<EOS>
in

several
other

<EOS>
His
lineament

ghastly
pale
from
loss

and
his
right
arm
appear

Dulcia
exclaim

anxiously

<EOS>
"
a
cup
of
wine

fortunately
the
larder
happen
to

<EOS>
the
viand
be
chiefly
of
a
substantial
character
—
so
much
the
well

John

,
as
he
look
on
,
almost
with
a
wolfish
eye
,
while
the
dish
be
be
set
upon
the
board
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
mountainous
roast
round
of
beef
,
a
couple
of
boil
pullet
,
little
the
bad
for
their
previous
appearance
at
the
board
,
a
dish
of
lark
,
a
huge
pigeon
-
pie
,
and
,
well
than
all
,
the
remain
of
a
mangificent
roast
bustard
—
bustard
be
then
to
be
meet
with
on
the
South
Downs
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
arrangement
for
this
impromptu
supper
be
complete
,
Clavering
,
upon
whom
the
generous
liquor
he
have
swallow
have
produce
a
very
beneficial
effect
,
be
bear
to
the
table
by
his
father
’s
direction
,
without
move
him
from
the
chair
wherein
he
sit
.
<EOS>
Giles
Moppett
,
who
act
as
carver
,
then
inquire
what
his
young
master
would
be
pleased
to
take
;
but
Clavering
refuse
to
touch
anything
till
John
Habergeon
have
be
serve
,
and
bade
Moppett
fill
a
plate
with
roast
beef
for
the
old
trooper
.
<EOS>
John
be
far
too
hungry
to
be
bashful
,
so
he
sit
down
,
as
he
be
enjoin
to
do
,
and
speedily
clear
his
plate
,
which
be
promptly
replenish
by
Moppett
.
<EOS>
the
old
trooper
be
no
indifferent
trencherman
in
a
general
way
;
but
just
now
he
seem
to
possess
an
inexhaustible
appetite
,
eat
like
one
half
famished
.
<EOS>
after
do
prodigious
execution
upon
the
round
of
beef
,
he
devour
a
leg
and
a
wing
of
the
bustard
—
no
trifling
feat
in
itself
—
only
pause
occasionally
in
his
task
to
empty
a
flagon
of
nut
-
brown
ale
,
pour
out
for
him
by
the
attentive
Martin
Geere
.
<EOS>
finally
,
he
attack
the
pigeon
-
pie
,
and
soon
make
a
great
hole
in
it
.
<EOS>
His
prowess
be
watch
with
infinite
satisfaction
by
Colonel
Maunsel
,
who
encourage
him
to
go
on
,
repeatedly
order
Giles
Moppett
to
fill
his
plate
anew
.
<EOS>
at
first
,
Clavering
eat
sparingly
and
slowly
,
but
as
he
gain
strength
his
appetite
increase
,
and
if
he
could
have
use
both
hand
,
he
may
,
perchance
,
have
rival
John
Habergeon
’s
wondrous
performance
,
for
he
seem
to
have
fast
as
long
as
the
old
trooper
.
<EOS>
but
notwithstanding
his
insatiable
hunger
,
the
young
man
take
good
care
to
call
in
Dulcia
’s
aid
to
cut
up
his
meat
for
him
,
which
he
be
certainly
entitled
to
do
,
see
that
he
could
not
perform
the
task
for
himself
.
<EOS>
a
pause
,
however
,
in
this
terrible
masticating
process
have
at
length
arrive
,
on
Clavering
’s
side
,
at
least
—
for
John
,
it
seem
,
would
never
cease
—
Colonel
Maunsel
think
he
may
venture
to
ask
for
some
particular
of
his
son
’s
escape
after
the
battle
.
<EOS>
the
first
inquiry
however
,
of
the
loyal
old
gentleman
be
,
whether
Clavering
know
aught
of
the
king?“I
trust
his
Majesty
have
escape
his
enemy
,
father
,
"
the
young
man
reply
;
"
but
I
have
hear
nothing
concern
him
since
I
be
separate
from
him
,
in
the
manner
I
will
proceed
to
recount
to
you
.
<EOS>
after
the
rout
on
that
unlucky
day
,
when
all
go
against
us

the

be
compel
to

Cleveland

Colonel
Wogan

in
cover
his
retreat
from
the
city

<EOS>
We
ride
off
at
nightfall
in
the
direction
of
Stourbridge

his
Majesty
have
decide
upon
take
refuge
at
Boscobel
House
,
whither
Mr.
Charles
Giffard
,
than
whom
there
breathe
not

more
loyal

to
conduct
him

<EOS>
”“I

can
avouch
,
from
my
personal
knowledge

that
he
be
as
loyal

him

<EOS>
I
also
know
Boscobel
,
and
White
Ladies
,
another
house

to
the
Giffards

in
either
place
his

secure
retreat

<EOS>
the
king
could
not
be
in
well
hand
than
those
of
loyal
Charles
Giffard

go
on

my
son
;
how
far
didst
accompany
his
majesty?”“within

make

who
bid
them
be
go
about
their
business
,
and
not
disturb
him
at
that
unseasonable
hour
of
the
night

<EOS>
this
latter
piece
of
information
be
well
calculate
to
allay
the
colonel
’s
fear
,
and
he
begin
to
agree
with
John
Habergeon
,
that
Patty
Whinchat
,
in
spite
of
her
positive
assertion
to
the
contrary
,
must
have
be
mistake
,
and
could
not
have
behold
the
mischievous
independent

<EOS>
deeming
,
therefore
,
that
further
precautionary
measure
be
unneede
for

whatever
may

requisite
on

—
he
see

Ovingdean

possess
a
retreat
of

very
skilfully
fabricate
amidst
the
brickwork
of
a
large
external
chimney
at
the
north

east
angle
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
no
indication
of
the
hiding

place
be
perceptible
from
without
,
even
on
careful
examination
.
<EOS>
the
chimney

nothing
unusual
in
its

,
though
of
great
size
;
large
chimney
be
common
enough
in
old
Sussex
house
,
as
may
be
observe
in

<EOS>
the

and

be
admit
by
a
narrow
loophole
,
screen
from
observation
by
a
grotesque
stone
gargoyle
project
from
the
roof
of
the
building
.
<EOS>
access
to
the
spot
be
of
course
obtain
from
within
.
<EOS>
in
a
spacious
bed
-
chamber
at
the
rear
of
the
house
,
use
by
Colonel
Maunsel
himself
,
there
be
a
large
oak
chimney
-
piece
,
the
left
jamb
of
which
,
carve
as
a
pilaster
,
turn
upon
a
pivot
,
and
could
be
instantly
set
in
motion
by
a
spring

amidst
the
foliage
of
the
capital
.
<EOS>
on
open
this
secret
door
an
aperture
be
disclose
large
enough
to
admit
a
man
,
and
communicate
with
a
narrow
passage
construct
within
the
thickness
of
the
wall
.
<EOS>
a
second
obstacle
,
however
,
be
set
in
the
way
of
the
searcher
<EOS>
,
should
they
have
succeed
in
penetrating
thus
far
.
<EOS>
within
a
couple
of
yard
of
the
fireplace
,
the
passage
be
block
up
by
what
seem
solid
masonry
;
but
the
impediment
,
though
apparently
insurmountable
,
could
easily
be
remove
by
touch
a
second
spring
.
<EOS>
beyond
this
,
the
passage
be
free
,
and
soon
terminate
in
the
small
chamber
already
describe
.
<EOS>
this
hide
-
place
naturally
occur
to
Colonel
Maunsel
,
as
he
lie
awake
,
and
painfully
ruminate
,
on
the
night
of
his
son
’s
return
to
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
but
though
the
asylum
may
be
a
secure
one
,
in
case
Clavering
should
be
denounce
by
Increase
Micklegift
(
for
the
colonel
could
not
wholly
shake
off
the
apprehension
of
this
possibility
)
,
yet
recourse
must
not
be
have
to
it
,
except
at
the
last
extremity
,
since
the
occupation
for
any
length
of
time
of
such
a
narrow
cell
by
the
young
man
,
in
his
present
wound
and
enfeeble
state
,
may
be
productive
of
most
disastrous
consequence
.
<EOS>
the
good
thing
to
be
do
<EOS>
,
it
seem
to
the
colonel
,
be
to
bring
Clavering
to
his
own
room
,
so
that
the
young
man
may
take
instant
refuge
within
the
hide
chamber
,
in
case
the
house
should
be
menace
with
a
perquisition
.
<EOS>
fortunately
,
none
of
the
household
,
except
trusty
John
Habergeon
,
be
acquaint
with
the
hiding

place
,
so
that
no
threat
or
maltreatment
on
the
part
of
the
searcher
could
extort
from
them
a
revelation
of
the
secret
.
<EOS>
all
continue
tranquil
,
however
,
during
the
night
.
<EOS>
wear
out
with
the
extraordinary
fatigue
and
privation
he
have
undergo
,
Clavering
sleep
so
soundly
,
that
if
the
malevolent
Independent
minister
,
accompany
by
a
dozen
Roundhead
musketeer
,
have
knock
at
his
door
,
he
would
scarce
have
be
arouse
.
<EOS>
John
Habergeon
,
who
occupy
a
truckle
-
bed
in
his
young
master
’s
room
,
sleep
soundly
too
,
but
the
old
trooper
have
the
vigilance
of
a
watchdog
,
and
would
have
be
up
,
and
on
the
alert
,
on
the
slight
disturbance
.
<EOS>
a
pair
of
pistol
lie
within
his
reach
,
in
case
of
a
surprise
.
<EOS>
long
before
daybreak
,
Colonel
Maunsel
,
who
have
sleep
but
little
,
as
we
have
state
,
arise
,
and
wrap
himself
in
a
dressing
-
gown
,
take
a
taper
,
which
burn
within
his
chamber
,
and
proceed
to
inspect
the
hiding
-
place
.
<EOS>
both
the
secret
spring
act
perfectly
,
and
the
cell
seem
as
dry
and
comfortable
as
such
a
place
could
well
be
;
indeed
,
its
contiguity
to
the
chimney
funnel
keep
it
warm
.
<EOS>
still
it
must
be
fit
up
yet
more
conveniently
for
Clavering
’s
reception
.
<EOS>
fraught
with
this
resolve
,
and
in
order
that
no
time
may
be
lose
,
the
colonel
repair
at
once
to
his
son
’s
room
,
marvel
within
himself
,
as
he
go
,
that
he
be
able
to
move
about
in
this
way
without
assistance
.
<EOS>
but
strength
seem
to
have
be
give
him
for
the
perilous
conjuncture
.
<EOS>
John
Habergeon
start
up
as
he
enter
the
room
,
and
the
first
impulse
of
the
old
trooper
be
to
seize
the
pistol
lie
beside
him
,
but
he
instantly
lay
down
the
weapon
on
recognize
the
intruder
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel
desire
him
,
in
a
low
tone
,
to
come
with
him
,
and
John
have
huddle
on
his
garment
as
expeditiously
as
he
could
,
they
quit
the
room
together
,
without
disturb
the
wounded
sleeper
.
<EOS>
act
under
the
colonel
’s
direction
,
John
place
a
variety
of
article
within
the
cell
,
likely
to
be
require
by
Clavering
,
if
he
should
be
force
to
occupy
it
;
and
these
arrangement
be
satisfactorily
make
,
and
the
secret
door
restore
to
its
customary
position
,
the
old
trooper
look
at
his
master
,
as
if
await
further
order
,
and
receive
none
,
he
observed:“a
plan
have
just
occur
to
me
for
deceive
the
enemy
,
which
,
with
your
honour
’s
permission
,
I
would
fain
put
into
execution
without
delay
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
believe
it
be
a
false
alarm
that
we
get
last
night
;
but
I
may
be
wrong
,
and
any
way
we
ought
to
be
cautious
where
Captain
Clavering
’s
liberty
and
life
be
concerned
.
<EOS>
My
notion
be
to
make
pretence
of
quit
the
house
before
daybreak
,
so
that
if
Increase
Micklegift
,
or
any
other
scoundrelly
spy
like
him
,
should
be
lurk
about
the
premise
—
as
may
be
the
case
,
for
aught
we
can
tell
—
he
may
fancy
the
captain
have
take
flight
in
reality
.
<EOS>
if
your
honour
think
well
of
the
scheme
,
I
will
hie
to
the
stable
at
once

and
saddle
a
couple
of
horses—”“thy
stratagem

good

the
colonel
interrupt

I
dare
not
adopt
it

<EOS>
My

”“I

John
Habergeon

I
should
be
loth
to
disturb
the
captain
from
such
a
slumber
as

hath
not
enjoy

he
quit
Worcester
;
but
there
be
no
occasion

that

<EOS>
Martin

be

him

upon

Martin
will
play
the
part
indifferent
well
,
especially
as
there
will
not
be
light
enough
to
observe
him
very
narrowly

<EOS>
My
object
be
not
merely
to
delude
the
enemy

to
persuade
the
household
that
Captain
Clavering
be
go

<EOS>
It
be
safe
to
keep
those
talkative
woman

folk
in

dark

<EOS>
I
can
rely
upon
old
Martin

silence

discretion

”“ay

I
doubt
not
Martin

the

<EOS>

you

<EOS>
what
will
you
do
with
the
horses?”“We

John
reply

<EOS>
"
I
will
make
clatter
enough
before
the
rectory
for
Increase
Micklegift
to
hear
us

and
a
word

two
roar
out
as
we
pass
will
satisfy
the
rascally

<EOS>
it
be
no
other
than
Captain

I
have
with

<EOS>
this

we

so
he
sit

<EOS>
how

he
arise

<EOS>
presently
the

as

essay
to
speak
,
and
his
sire
,
bend
towards
him
,
hear
him
distinctly
pronounce
the
name

Dulcia

<EOS>
slight
as
be
the
circumstance
,
it
confirm
a
suspicion
which
the
old
Cavalier
have
begin
of
late
to
entertain
,
that
a
mutual
attachment
subsist
between
the
young
folk

and
the
certitude

fact
be
by
no

agreeable
to
him

partial
to
Dulcia

entertaining
,
moreover
,
a
sincere
respect

esteem
for
her
worthy
father
,
Colonel
Maunsel
be
yet
a
very
proud
man
,

never
contemplate
such
a
union
for
his

as
may
here
take

this

light
a

light

at

he

it
in

<EOS>
indeed
,
he
have
little
time
for
reflection

<EOS>
the
hour

<EOS>
Ere

the

it

<EOS>
the
heavy

neither

do
Clavering
appear
to
be
conscious

<EOS>
call
out
fiercely
that
he

Roundhead

he
command
his

to
take
his

from
off
him
;
but
immediately
perceive
his
error
,
he
become
silent
,
while
the

in

on

<EOS>
as

thus
watch
,
a
head

from
the
end
of
the
alley
near
the
house
,
but
it
be
so
suddenly
withdraw
that
he
could
not
tell
to
whom
it
belong
.
<EOS>
after
wait
for
several
minute
without
perceive
anything
further
of
the
owner
of
the
head
,
the
colonel
turn
to
mention
the
circumstance
to
his
son

and
then
find
that
Clavering
,
overcome
by
weariness

have
throw
himself
,
dress
as
he
be
,
upon
the
bed
,
and
be
once
more

<EOS>
not

to

him
,
the
brave
old
gentleman
take
up
his
sword
and
be
on
the
point
of
descend
to

when
a
tap

and
John

<EOS>
on

what
have

,
John

not
a
second
,
but
,
fly
down
stair
,
make
the
good
of
his
way
to
the
yew
-
tree
avenue
;
the
colonel
look
on
all
the
while
from
the
window
.
<EOS>
John
,
however
,
start
no
spy
from
the
covert
,
and
only
disturb
a
pair
of
blackbird
in
his
search
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
extend
his
investigation
,
as
far
as
he
judge
prudent
,
in
the
direction
of
the
parsonage
house
,
but
with
an
equally
fruitless
result
,
and
he
be
oblige
to
return
to
his
master
without
any
intelligence

the
intruder
.
<EOS>
the
old
Cavalier
be
much
troubled
.
<EOS>
that
some
one
have
be
lurk
within
the
garden
<EOS>
he
feel
sure
,
for
he
could
not
doubt
the
evidence
of
his
sense
;
and
that
this
person
come
with
no
friendly
intent
be
equally
manifest
.
<EOS>
danger
,
therefore
,
be
to
be
apprehend
,
and
must
be
the
more
carefully
guard
against
,
inasmuch
as
its
design
be
secret
.
<EOS>
John
then
relate
what
he
have
do
.
<EOS>
accord
to
his
own
belief
,
his
stratagem
have
be
perfectly
successful
.
<EOS>
Old
Martin
Geere
have
be
disguise
in
the
manner
<EOS>
arrange
,
the
pair
ride
slowly
up
the
hill
-
side
by
the
rectory
,
and
when
close
to
the
house
,
John
halt
for
a
moment
to
vociferate
an
adieu
to
the
Independent
minister
,
and
be
well
pleased
to
hear
a
window
suddenly
open
,
and
to
perceive
the
reverend
gentleman
with
a
nightcap
on
his
head
,
look
out
at
them
.
<EOS>
rate
them
for
a
couple
of
drunken
malignant
,
and
declare
that
Satan
be
at
their
heel
,
and
would
assuredly
trip
them
up
ere
they
have
proceed
far
on
their
journey
,
Increase
may
have
favour
them
with
a
still
longer
harangue
,
but
that
John
interrupt
him
with
a
roar
of
derisive
laughter
,
and
push
on
after
his
companion
.
<EOS>
John
and
old
Martin
then
cross
the
hill
,
and
,
shape
their
course
in
a
northerly
direction
up
the
valley
as
if
bind
for
Falmer
,
get
round
to
the
rottingdean
road
,
and
so
over
the
down
to
the
little
thicket
at
the
back
of
the
Grange
,
where
Martin
dismount
,
and
<EOS>
John
,
take
both
horse
to
the
stable
,
call
up
the
groom
and
his
helpmate
,
lead
them
to
suppose
that
their
young
master
be
go
.
<EOS>
not
have
encounter
any
one
during
the
ride
,
John
have
persuade
himself
that
his
return
to
the
stable
be
unnoticed
,
until
the
incident
in
the
garden
make
him
fear
that
his
supposition
may
not
be
altogether
correct
.
<EOS>
He
now
naturally
enough
conclude
,
that
Increase
Micklegift
,
suspect
an
attempt
to
dupe
him
,
have
steal
down
to
the
grange
to
satisfy
himself
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
if
so
,
he
could
have
learn
little
.
<EOS>
the
wary
measure
take
be
sufficient
to
mislead
him
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
conclusion
arrive
at
both
by
the
colonel
and
John
.
<EOS>
but
they
agree
,
that
the
utmost
caution
must
be
observe
while
they
be
watch
by
an
enemy
so
wily
as
the
preacher
.
<EOS>
“It
vex
me
much
to
think
that
I
can
not
send
for
a
surgeon
to
attend
upon
my
son
,
"
the
colonel
say
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
Master
Ingram

Lewes

Ralph
Hoathleigh

Brightelmstone

even
old
Isaac
Woodruff

Rottingdean
—
any
one
of
them
would
do
;
but
I
dare
not
trust
them

<EOS>
besides
,
it
would
excite
suspicion

be
send
for

<EOS>
”“no

the
old
trooper

<EOS>
"
the
captain
’s
wound
be
in
a
fair
way
of
healing
,

his
broken
bone
have
already

<EOS>
He
only
want
rest

up

”“Dulcia

why
should

<EOS>
Saidst

She

<EOS>
“his

it

his

it

the

his

,
suit
well

quite

<EOS>
notwithstanding

,
Colonel

wage

a

<EOS>
the
unusual
circumstance
of
the
colonel
’s
ride
forth
to
enjoy
the
pastime
of
hawking
would
have
suffice
to
bring
a
portion
of
the
household
to
the
gate

but
there
be
another
motive
for
gather
together
so
many
of
them
on

which
may

detect
in

<EOS>
not
that
their
fidelity
to
the
colonel

his
son
be
shake
by
it
;
but
know
that
Clavering
have
return
on
the
previous
night
,
they
be
very
apprehensive
for
his
safety
;
for
though
tell
that
the

before
daybreak

few
of

credit
the

feel
convinced

It

to

<EOS>
Our
old
Cavalier
have
a
great
love
for
the
eminence
on
which
he
now
find
himself
.
<EOS>
in
moment
of
impatience
he
talk
of
exile
himself
from
the
rebellious
land
of
his
birth
,
but
he
would
have
be
miserable
if
he
have
carry
his
threat
into
execution

His
severe

attack
have
confine
him
of

altogether
to

,
summer
have
go
by
,
and
he
have
not

visit
his

down

It

therefore
,
with
redouble
delight
that
he
find
himself
,
after
so
long
an
absence

once
more
upon

breezy
height

<EOS>
cross
the

the

reach
the
brim

hollowed

come

halt

the
side
of
this

smooth
as

carpet

the
rich
turf

<EOS>
here
and
there
,
a
little
rounded
prominence
,

gentle
depression
,
heighten
their
charm
,
as

piquancy

a

thicket

opposite

be

so
steep

He

all
their

decline
to
enter
a

him
there

no

where
he

a

Swift
as

<EOS>
It
be
a

<EOS>
both

trampling
of
horse
suddenly
rouse
him
.
<EOS>
look
in
the
direction
whence
the
sound
proceed
<EOS>
,
he
perceive
a
small
body
of
trooper
advance
towards
him
at
a
rapid
trot
along
the
road
lead
from
the
adjacent
village
of
Kingston
to
Iford
and
Rodmill
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
these
man
must
belong
to
the
Parliamentary
army

for
since
the

hear
from
his
father
that

detachment
of
Cromwell

just
arrive
at
Lewes
,
Ninian
rightly
divine
that
these
man
must
belong
to
that
invincible
troop
.
<EOS>
Their
leader
,
in
fact
,
be
no
other
than
the
dread
Captain
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
not
like
to
hurry
off
,
the
young
falconer
judge
it
good
to
remain
where
he
be
until
the
troop
should
pass
by
.
<EOS>
They
be
now
within
bow

shot
of
him

and
he
could
discern
that
they
be
all
powerful
-
look
man
,
well
-
mount
,
well-
accoutre
,
and
apparently
well
-
deserve
the
hardy

they
have
acquire

<EOS>
Their

and
saddle

cloth
be
of
scarlet
,
the
original
bright
hue
of
which
have
suffer
from
exposure
to
weather
,
and
service
in
the
field

but
their
steel
breastplate
,
tasset
,
and
head

piece
,
be
highly
polished
,
and
gleam
brightly
in
the
sunshine

broad
leathern
belt

and
bear
a
long
sword
at
his
side

and
a
carabine

from
his
shoulder

<EOS>
there
be
no
mark
distinction
between
the
leader
of

those
under

except
that
the
helmet

corslet
of

in

a
crimson
sash

gold
across
his

<EOS>
at
his
side

<EOS>
Captain
Stelfax

heavily
build

square
set
,
and
very
muscular
,
and
endow
with
such
prodigious
strength
of
arm
,
that
,
like
a
knight
of
old
,
he
could
cleave
a
foeman
to
the
chine

<EOS>
Captain
Stelfax
be
not

to
be
so
rigorous
an
ascetic
as
the
elder

may
have
desire

be
a
thoroughly
brave
soldier
,
and
of
try
fidelity
to
the
cause
,
his
failing
be

with
a
lenient
eye
.
<EOS>
though
ferocious
in
the
field

and
merciless

it

humoured
,
and
his
feature
handsome

though
rather
coarse

<EOS>
His
hair
be
crop
short
,
but
he
wear
a
bushy
red
beard
,
the
glow
hue
of
which
put
to
shame
the
tarnished
splendour
of
his
scarlet
doublet
.
<EOS>
a
weighty
man
,
like
this
captain
of
ironside
,
require
a
strong
horse
to
carry
him
,
and
he
ride
a

and
shout
to
the
young
falconer
to
come
to
him
.
<EOS>
Ninian
do
not
dare
to
disobey
,
and
though
he
would
much
rather
have
take
to
his
heel
,
he
affect
great
alacrity
in
comply
with
the
summon
.
<EOS>
Captain
Stelfax
put
a
few
interrogatory
to
him
in
a
brief
authoritative
tone
,
and
appear
satisfied
with
the
reply
he
receive
;
but
as
soon
as
he

that
it
be
Colonel
Maunsel
who
be

summit
of
the

,
and
present
himself
before
Colonel

—
the
more
so
,
he
say
,
as
he
be
actually

in

and
only
stipulate
that
he
and
the
young

may
be

descend
at
a
point
where

loll
back
listlessly
in
his

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
the

who
thus

in
1538
:
"
<EOS>
I

”From

give

one
piece

counsel

Colonel

a

fugitive
Royalists

be
not

I
pray
you
—
one
of
the
most
obnoxious
malignant
hereabouts
<EOS>
,
Ovingdean
Grange
hath
the
foremost
place
on

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
if
it

so

be
warn
by

I

you
,
and
if
you
value
your
friend
’s
life
and
your
own
safety

let
him
depart
without
delay

<EOS>
the
search
will
be
make
by
an
officer
of
the
Lord
General
’s
own
troop
of
ironside
,
Captain
Stelfax
,
who
hath
lately
come
to
Lewes
—
a
merciless
man
,
with
the
power
of
a
provost-
marshal
—
and
if
he
should
find
an
unfortunate
royalist
,
he
would
think
no
more
of
shoot
him
than
of
string
up
a
deserter

<EOS>
excuse
me
,
colonel

<EOS>
I
have
think
it
my
duty
to
warn
you

<EOS>
not

it

him
in
the
buttery
,
discuss
a
jug
of
ale
and
a
mouthful
of
bread
and
cheese—“bren
cheese

"
the
old
trooper
would
have
term
it
in
his
Sussex
vernacular
—
with
Giles
Moppett
and
old
Martin
Geere
,
and
instantly
deliver
the

care

add
that
the
leader
of

entertain
the

down

be
he
to
venture
forth

those

and
then

rascally
Micklegift

<EOS>
”“ay

rather

”“You

you

John

Mr.

remark
;

though
such
tender
consideration
for
us
seem
wholly
inconsistent

your
reverence
would
admit

if

John

the

touch
the

You

all
you

<EOS>
do
not

dishearten

if
we
should
be
unable
to
communicate
with
you
for
some
time

let
no
summon
—
no
alarm

induce
you
to
come
forth

<EOS>
mind
that

<EOS>
”“I

they

intelligence
that

but
enough
be
relate
to
fill
the
colonel
with
deep
disquietude:—the
only
relief
to
his

be
afford
by
the
certitude
which
he
likewise
derive
from
his

that
Ninian

have
quit

consequently
he
could
give
no

what
have

but
he
know
enough
to
heighten
his
master

and
Dulcia
’s
alarm
,
and
fear
the
bad
—
the
bad
with

hurry
upstairs

at
the
moment

<EOS>
increase
Micklegift

prevent

<EOS>
Their
entrance
operate
as
a
check
upon
the

violence

<EOS>
at
the
sight
of
Dulcia
,
Stelfax
,
by
a
sudden
effort

constrain
his
wrath
;

the
two
trooper
involuntarily
draw
back
as
the

maiden
rush
up
to
Mr.

and
fling
her
arm
around

<EOS>
“What

<EOS>
“they

for
Mr.

agitation
almost
deprive
him
of
the
power
of

<EOS>
“torture

impossible

"
<EOS>
cry
Dulcia
,
in
an
agonized
voice
.
<EOS>
"
cruel
as
they
be
,
they
can
not
mean
it

<EOS>
They
must
have
some
respect
for
religion
—
some
reverence
for
grey
hair
.
<EOS>
”“alas

<EOS>
they
have
none

Mr.

"
neither
my

<EOS>
and
,
as
he
speak
,
he
cast
a
grateful
look
at
Micklegift

<EOS>
“Is
<EOS>
this
so
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Dulcia
to
Stelfax

<EOS>
"
do
you
still
hold
to
your

I

extort

the
Ironside

I
do
not

Micklegift

incredulity

<EOS>
”Stelfax

”“How

I
have
a

Hath
Amon

<EOS>
"
the
Young

hath
be
here

You

remove

”“assuredly

Stelfax

<EOS>
Colonel
Maunsel

leave

deny

here
again
his

for

to
him

in

tone

leave
no
alternative

compliance

that

<EOS>
It
be
not
without
considerable
trepidation
that

and
,
on

the

have
repair

the

report
that
Stelfax
have
cause
a

wood

light

before
which
he
be
comfortably
seat

a
piece
of
intelligence
which
do
not
tend
to
mitigate
the
old
Cavalier
’s
anxiety
,
since
it
decrease
the
chance

his
son

escape

<EOS>
deeply
do
Colonel
Maunsel
now
regret
that
he
be
deprive
of
the
assistance
of
John
Habergeon
,
whose
shrewdness
may
have
help
him
at
this
fearful
emergency

<EOS>
but
John
be
a

well
as
Clavering

as
to
poor

Martin
Geere
,
he
be
so
bewilder
as
to
be
utterly
incapable
of
lend
efficient
assistance
.
<EOS>
resignation

therefore

be
all
that

the
old
Cavalier
.
<EOS>
He
try
to
calm
himself
,
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
suspense
and
anxiety
quite
overmaster
him
,
and
reduce
him
at
last
to
a
state
of
almost
stupor
.
<EOS>
if
the
colonel
be
plunge
into
the
depth
of
gloom
and
despondency
,
Dulcia
and
her
father
be
scarcely
less
miserable
.
<EOS>
in
vain
the
good

seek
to
console
his

<EOS>
His

fall
upon

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
’s

for

<EOS>
and
now
to

<EOS>
as
may
be
suppose

the

by

displease
by
the
information

they
be

at

<EOS>
like
true
soldier

they
know
right

there

side

the
redcoat
,
whom
Moppett
privately
declare
to
be
as
ravenous
as
wolf
,
and
as
thirsty
as

<EOS>
on
their
part
,
the
Ironsides
do
not
give
way
to
any
great
licence
,
and
take
care
not
to
drink
to
excess
,
but
they
smoke
incessantly
,
and
make
the
whole
house
reek
like
a
tavern
with
the
fume
of
tobacco
.
<EOS>
They
go
about
where
they
list
,
without
display
much
respect
for
the

they
encounter

<EOS>
thus
,
three

four
of
them

smoke
of

enter
the

where
the
unhappy
colonel

and
,
regardless
of
his
look
of
anger
and
disgust
,
continue
to
puff
away
at
their
pipe
as
they
leisurely
examine
the
portrait
on

or
other
object
that
attract

unseemly

up
the

and
the
other
a

they
sit
down

to
enter
into

<EOS>
doubtless

Dulcia

who
withdraw
with
Patty

on
the
appearance

<EOS>
the

have
no

have
make
up
his

fugitive

purpose

and
even
as
stable
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
think
the
suggestion
good
,
but
in
order
to
satisfy
himself
of
its
feasibility
,
he
go
forth
with
Delves
to
inspect
the
sacred
structure
.
<EOS>
the
little
church
,
it
will
be
remember
,
be

a
short
distance
from

stand
on

the

reach
it

on
enter
the

the

prove
to
be

whereupon
Stelfax
despatch
the
sergeant
to
the
adjacent
rectory
for
the
key
.
<EOS>
while
delf
depart
on
the
errand
,
his
leader
stroll
about
the
churchyard
,
examine
the
venerable
structure
from
different
point
of
view
—
not
with
any
feeling
of
reverence
for
its
sacred
character
,
or
admiration
of
its
architectural
beauty
,
but
merely
with
a
view
to
its
adaptation
to
the
purpose
of
a
temporary
stronghold
.
<EOS>
all
be
still
around
.
<EOS>
the
evening
be
serene
and
beautiful

<EOS>
the
sun
have
sink
below
the
western
hill
;
and
the
low
square
tower
of
the
church
be
darkly
define
against
the
glowing
sky
.
<EOS>
the
only
object
not
in
harmony
with
the
peaceful
scene
be
the
formidable
figure
of
the
Ironside
in
his
martial
accoutrement
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
’s
examination
of
the
sacred
fabric
be
quite
satisfactory
to
him

<EOS>
the
tower
at
the
west
end
of
the
structure
appear
to
offer
all
he
could
desire
in
the
way

<EOS>
It

acutely
point

and
so
narrow
as
to
preclude
all
chance

escape
by

mean
.
<EOS>
if
the
interior
of

tower
correspond
with
its
outward
appearance
,
it
would
suit
the
captain

requirement
admirably
.
<EOS>
proceed
to
the
parsonage

house
,
Delves
open
the
door
without
trouble
himself
to
knock
at
it

seek
out

<EOS>
the

the

be
too
quick
for
him

possess
himself
of
the
prize

depart

sorely

fly

be
only
divide
from
the

by
a
wall

soon
manage
to
obtain
a
position
whence
,
without
betray
himself

he
could

command
their
proceeding

overhear
their
discourse

so
long

at

<EOS>
Stelfax

still

watch

<EOS>
something
there
be
in
the
appearance
of
the
horseman
that
lead
both
looker
-
on
to
the
conclusion
that
they
be
fugitive
Cavaliers
;
and
the
curiosity
of
the
Ironsides
be
greatly
excited
to
learn
who
they
be
,
and
what
could
have
bring
them
to
the
Grange
,
at
a
moment
of
such
peril
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
suppose
Royalists
,
totally
unconscious
of
danger

gallop
on
,

be

almost
at

“If

forth
his

he

down

make
for

<EOS>
another
instant
confirm
the
suspicion
which
both
iron

side
have
entertain
,
that
the
horseman
be
Royalists
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
have
the
twain
enter
the
gate
,
through
which
they
ride
with
insensate
haste
and
utter
recklessness
of
consequence
,
than
they
be
challenge
by
the
sentinel
post
within
the
court

<EOS>
at
once
comprehend
the
peril
in
which
their
inadvertence
have
place
them
,
the
reckless
horseman
endeavour
to
back
out

<EOS>
see
this
,
one
of
the
trooper
rush
towards
the
gate
,
in
order
to
close
them
,
and
cut
off
their
retreat
,
while
the
other
,
present
his
carabine
,
threaten
to
fire
if
they
move

<EOS>
nothing
daunt
,
however
,
the
Cavalier
against
whom
the
musket
be
level
,
and
who
be
but
a
short
distance
from
the
sentinel
,
have
manage

draw
his

strike
the

<EOS>
the
carabine
go
off

it
fall

but
do
no
mischief

<EOS>
all
this
be
the
work
of
a
minute

and
so
rapidly
have
the
horseman
turn
,
that
the
one
next
the

pass
through
them
before
the
trooper
could
swing
round
the

Cavalier
would

his
retreat

up

but
the
Cavalier
,
plunge
spur
into
his
steed
,
dash
against
him
with
such
force
as
to
hurl
him
to
the
ground
;
in
which
position
the
sergeant
discharge
his
pistol
at
the
fugitive
,
but
without
effect

<EOS>
less
lucky
than
his
companion

who
thus
get
off
uninjured
,
the
second
Cavalier
have
to
encounter
Stelfax
,
who
rush
up
to
him
without
hesitation
,
and
,
seize
his
bridle
,
bade
him
surrender
.
<EOS>
the
Cavalier
reply
by
a
desperate
cut
at
the
Ironside
leader
’s
head
,
which
may
have
clear
the
way
for
him
if
it
have
take
effect
;
but
Stelfax
ward
off
the
blow
,
and
,
catch
hold
of
his
antagonist
,
drag
him
by
sheer
force
of

so
brief

that
no

<EOS>
the
luckless
Cavalier

have
thus
be
capture
by

be
tall

well

His
attire
be
sad

coloured

and
of
Puritan
plainness
,
and
his
lock
crop
close
to
his
head

<EOS>
nevertheless
,
his
look

deportment
do
not
agree
with
these

of
Puritanism

<EOS>
He
be
a

”As

utter

his

He
begin

debate
with
himself
the
possibility
of
stir
up

<EOS>
but
Delves
do
not

him
much
time
for
reflection

<EOS>
though
regard
Lord
Wilmot
’s
speech
as
mere
bravado
—
Cavalier
’s
rodomontade

he
style
it
—
<EOS>
the

think
that
the

have
give
their

licence
enough

<EOS>
a

must

<EOS>
the
command
rouse
the

Cavalier
’s
ire

he
seem
by
no

obey
it

his

besought
him
by
his
look

compliance

,
after
a
little
hesitation

he
remount
the

<EOS>
very
strange
the
place
look
by
this
lurid
light
—
so
much
like
a

<EOS>
the
sergeant

Clavering

silent

<EOS>
but
John

do
not
display
any
such
self

loudly
remonstrate
with

in

succeed
in

an
oaken

,
a
flask
of

,
a
loaf
of
bread
with
some
cold

the

set
his

the
example
by
make
a
vigorous
attack
upon
a
goose

pie
,
which
,
in
addition
to
be
very
savoury
,
be
strongly
provocative
of
thirst
,
compel
the
sergeant
to
make
frequent
application
to
the
wine

flask
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
would
almost
seem
as
if
those
who
stock
the
basket
have
seek
out
the
most
powerful
incentive
to
drinking

<EOS>
besides
the
goose

there

<EOS>
but
the
thirst
of
the
Ironsides
seem
to
increase
instead
of

Tola

ask

by
Besadaiah

of

<EOS>
in

to
abstain

His

the
odour
so
irresistible

the
vessel
without
take

its

<EOS>
the
strong
water
quickly
unloose
the
tongue
of
the

;
they
begin
to
laugh

talk
loudly
,
to
sing
and
shout
,
comport
themselves
as
boisterously
as
wassailer
at
a

<EOS>
They
give
themselves
up
to
enjoyment

luxuriously

they

the

have
be
enough
to
disclose
to
his

the
inebriate

of
the

<EOS>
He

could

no

of

yet
he
ought

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
but
Stelfax
do
not
pause
long
in
reflection
.
<EOS>
dash
down
the
hill

side
towards
the
shepherd
,
he
fiercely
demand
whether
he
have
see
a
horseman
pass
by
,
and
in
which
direction
he
have
ride
.
<EOS>
“oh
<EOS>
yes

I

"
the

reply
;
"
he

well

trample
down

<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>

"
<EOS>
Stelfax
furiously
demand
.
<EOS>
"
and

me

thou

<EOS>
I

I

<EOS>
”“I
have
no

"
the
old
man
reply
,
in
a
voice
quaver
with
terror

as
he
speak
,
with
his
crook
towards
an
acclivity
on

west
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
tarry
not
a
moment
longer
,
but
gallop
off
with
his
man
in
the
direction
indicate
by
the
shepherd
.
<EOS>
the
brow
of
the
hill
be
cover
so
thickly
with
furze
that
it
be
impossible
to
pursue
a
straightforward
course
over
it
,
and
the
Ironsides
have
to
deviate
a
little
to
the
left
in
order
to
avoid
the
impediment
.
<EOS>
They
soon
,
however
,
cross
the
summit
,
and
then
fresh
valley
open
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
new
down
,
too
,
rise
before
them
,
vary
little
in
aspect
or
character
from
those
which
they
have
just
traverse
.
<EOS>
though
the
summit
still
glow
with
the
reflected
radiance
of
the
sky
,
the
coomb
look
dull
and
sombre
;
but
there
be
no
positive
obscurity
,
and
as
Stelfax
plunge
his
gaze
into
the
hollow
,
he
fail
in
discover
the
object
of
his
quest
.
<EOS>
on
either
hand
the
valley
be
wide
and
extensive
,
and
the
side
of
the
hill
bare
,
and
destitute
of
covert
sufficient
to
screen
the
fugitive
from
observation
.
<EOS>
the
valley
on
the
left
,
which
run
in
a
northerly
direction
—
the
course
apparently
take
by
the
fugitive
—
be
so
broad
and
open
,
that
,
have
the
fly
horseman
go
that
way
<EOS>
,
he
must
have
be
at
once
distinguished
.
<EOS>
but
neither
on
the
right
or
on
the
left
could
he
be
see
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
ascend
the
opposite
down
,
he
must
necessarily
be
in
view
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
not
there
.
<EOS>
these
consideration
lead
Stelfax
to
the
conclusion
that
he
must
have
find
some
place
of
concealment
,
and
his
suspicion
be
instantly
direct
to
a
small
holt
or
thicket
grow
near
the
foot
of
the
opposite
hill
,
which
would
offer
convenient
shelter
.
<EOS>
satisfied
with
the
correctness
of
his
supposition
,
the
Roundhead
leader
at
once
give
direction
to
his
man
to
separate
,
and
approach
the
wood
in
such
manner
as
would
enable
them
most
completely
to
invest
it
.
<EOS>
the
injunction
be
promptly
obey
,
Stelfax
himself
move
off
a
little
to
the
left
,
and
then
mount
the
hill
-
side
,
so
as
to
bring
himself
close
to
the
top
of
the
holt
which
straggle
slantingly
up
the
acclivity
.
<EOS>
these
precautionary
measure
take
,
entrance
be
simultaneously
make
into
the
thicket
at
four
different
point
.
<EOS>
the
timber
of
which
the
holt
be
compose
consist
almost
entirely
of
ash
,
hazel
,
and
oak
.
<EOS>
none
of
the
tree
have
attain
any
great
size
,
and
be
plant
closely
together
—
much
too
closely
to
allow
free
growth
—
while
bramble
and
thorn
likewise
abound
in
the
thicket
,
it
be
in
place
almost
impervious
.
<EOS>
the
crashing
of
branch
proclaim
the
advance
of
the
ironside
,
and
more
than
one
pheasant
be
disturb
by
them
.
<EOS>
but
as
yet
the
fugitive
have
not
be
detect
.
<EOS>
all
at
once
Stelfax
,
who
have
push
on
more
expeditiously
than
his
man
,
descry
the
horseman
hide
in
the
depth
of
the
grove
.
<EOS>
unable
to
repress
a
shout
of
exultation
at
the
sight
,
he
call
to
the
Cavalier
to
surrender
,
but
the
latter
reply
by
fire
a
pistol
at
him
:
the
thickly
intervene
tree
render
it
impossible
that
aim
could
be
take
,
the
ball
lodge
in
the
trunk
of
an
adjoining
oak
.
<EOS>
the
Cavalier
then
turn
and
endeavour
to
make
good
his
retreat
,
while
Stelfax
press
vigorously
after
him
,
shout
to
his
man
to
intercept
him
.
<EOS>
but
it
soon
appear
that
the
fugitive
be
quite
as
active
as
his
pursuer
,
and
understand
rather
better
than
they
do
how
to
make
his
way
through
a
tangled
thicket
.
<EOS>
He
dexterously
slip
through
the
tree
,
while
the
fiery
haste
and
impetuosity
of
Stelfax
only
tend
to
his
own
disadvantage
.
<EOS>
the
Roundhead
leader
make
one
or
two
ineffectual
dash
at
the
Cavalier
,
but
the
other
easily
avoid
him
,
and
,
guide
by
the
noise
make
by
the
advance
trooper
,
he
likewise
manage
to
keep
out
of
their
way
.
<EOS>
this
adroit
mode
of
proceeding
soon
increase
the
distance
between
Stelfax
and
himself
,
and
enable
him
to
obtain
a
considerable
start
ere
the
Roundhead
leader
and
his
man
could
extricate
themselves
from
the
holt
and
give
chase
.
<EOS>
both
pursued
and
pursuer
now
go
along
at
a
headlong
pace
.
<EOS>
for
some
little
time
the
Cavalier
keep
in
the
valley
,
and
cross
the
rough
and
ill
-
keep
road
lead
to
Lewes
.
<EOS>
at
that
time
there
be
no
direct
road
from
the
metropolis
to
Brightelmstone
,
and
only
the
deep
-
rut
cart
-
road
just
mention
between
the
latter
place
and
Lewes
.
<EOS>
the
whole
district
be
perfectly
open
and
unenclosed
—
not
a
hedge
or
fence
exist
,
save
in
the
neighbourhood
of
some
sequester
homestead
—
there
be
nothing
to
check
the
progress
either
of
the
fugitive
or
those
on
his
track
.
<EOS>
on
—
on
they
go
—
now
traverse
a
wind
valley
,
now
mount
a
hill
—
anon
descend
to
another
dell
—
cross
it
,
and
make
a
new
ascent
.
<EOS>
all
this
without
in
the
slight
degree
relax
speed
.
<EOS>
the
Cavalier
seem
in
no
wise
trouble
about
his
pursuer
,
feel
confident
,
apparently
,
that
he
should
leave
them
behind
in
the
end
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
<EOS>
not
a
single
individual
have
be
encounter
.
<EOS>
the
down
seem
wholly
desert
.
<EOS>
the
Cavalier
have
now
gain
the
summit
of
the
hill
on
which
the
ancient
encampment
call
Hollingsbury
Castle
may
be
trace
,
and
as
his
pursuer
be
not
more
than
half
way
up
the
hill
,
he
draw
in
the
rein
near
the
old
earthwork
,
to
breathe
his
panting
steed
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
see
him
pause
thus
,
Stelfax
and
his
man
hurry
on
;
but
ere
they
could
get
within
pistol
-
shoot
,
he
speed
off
down
the
smooth
turf
of
the
declivity
,
as
if
make
for
the
pretty
little
village
of
Preston
,
the
church
of
which
could
be
discern
in
the
valley
,
about
half
a
mile
off
,
embosome
in
tree
.
<EOS>
but
the
fugitive
,
it
soon
become
manifest
,
have
no
intention
of
enter
the
village
.
<EOS>
He
soon
strike
off
on
the
right
,
and
keep
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
until
he
have
pass
Patcham
and
its
hang
wood
,
cross
the
valley
now
traverse
by
the
railway
,
and
ascend
the
opposite
hill
.
<EOS>
probably
,
he
have
conjecture
that
the
Ironsides
,
find
their
effort
to
come
up
with
him
fruitless
,
would
desist
from
further
pursuit
—
but
in
this
supposition
he
be
deceive
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
be
not
the
man
to
be
baffle
.
<EOS>
as
long
as
their
horse
could
carry
them
,
he
and
his
trooper
would
follow
—
and
though
their
steed
be
not
so
swift
as
that
of
the
Cavalier
,
they
be
strong
,
and
capable
of
great
endurance
.
<EOS>
so
not
many
minute
elapse
ere
<EOS>
they
be
on
the
top
of
the
down
and
gallop
after
him
.
<EOS>
with
the
evident
intention
of
disembarrass
himself
of
them
,
the
fugitive
now
lead
them
into
all
sort
of
difficult
place
,
and
practise
every
possible
manœuvre
to
shake
them
off
.
<EOS>
in
vain
.
<EOS>
They
still
hold
on
;
while
the
stratagem
essay
by
the
Cavalier
have
more
than
once
well
-
nigh
lead
to
his
capture
.
<EOS>
It
be
after
a
mischance
of
this
kind
,
in
which
an
attempt
to
double
have
be
dexterously
check
by
Stelfax
,
that
he
suddenly
change
his
plan
,
and
once
more
set
off
straight
-
a
-
head
with
great
swiftness
.
<EOS>
They
be
now
upon
a
chain
of
down
that
terminate
on
the
north
in
the
lofty
and
steep
escarpment
closely
adjoin
the
extraordinary
trench
popularly
know
as
the
Devil
’s
Dyke
.
<EOS>
It
be
towards
the
steep
part
of
this
dangerous
declivity
that
the
Cavalier
now
ride
.
<EOS>
perfectly
acquaint
with
the
country
,
as
the
result
prove
,
he
know
whither
he
be
go
,
and
be
prepare
for
the
hazardous
feat
he
have
to
perform
.
<EOS>
not
so
his
pursuer
.
<EOS>
this
precipitous
escarpment
,
which
stand
like
a
great
natural
bulwark
at

south
of

broad
Weald
of
Sussex
—
the
whole
of

immense
and
beautiful
tract

discernible
at
one
glance
from
it
—
slope
suddenly
and
abruptly
down
,
without
the
slight
interruption
to
the

,
the
perilous
nature
of
the
descent
be
materially
increase
by
the
slippery
condition
of
the
turf
,
which
offer
,
at
dry
season
especially
,
a
very
insecure
footing
.
<EOS>
a
single
false
step
would
send
the
luckless
wight
who
make
it
slide
to
the
foot
of
the
escarpment
in
double-
quick
time
.
<EOS>
on
the
brow
of
this
lofty
hill
be
the
remain
of
an
encampment
,
with
a
wide
ditch
and
a
rampart
surround
it
of
nearly
a
mile
in
circumference
.
<EOS>
adjacent
to
this
camp
,
and
divide
it
from
the
low
range
of
down
,
be
the
Dyke
.
<EOS>
skirt
the
brink
of
this
remarkable
chasm
,
the
Cavalier
ride
on
,
and
pass
through
a
breach
in
the
outwork
of
the
camp
,
make
for
that
portion
of
the
rampart
which
overlook
the
steep
part
of
the
declivity
.
<EOS>
He
pause
not
for
a
moment
,
but
ere
reach
the
verge
of
the
rampart
,
cast
a
glance
of
defiance
at
his
pursuer
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
,
at
that
instant
,
be
pass
through
the
breach
on
the
south
side
of
the
camp
.
<EOS>
unaware
of
the
perilous
nature
of
the
feat
about
to
be
attempt
,
he
see
the
Cavalier
spring
from
the
edge
of
the
rampart
,
and
plunge
down
the
descent
beyond
it
.
<EOS>
intend
to
follow
him
,
the
Roundhead
officer
ride
on
,
but
as
he
near
the
brink
of
the
declivity
,
and
its
precipitous
and
dangerous
character
become
fully
reveal
to
him
,
he
recoil
,
and
draw
in
the
rein
with
such
force
that
he
almost
pull
back
his
steed
upon
his
haunch
.
<EOS>
just
in
time
!
<EOS>
in
another
instant
he
would
have
leap
the
rampart
,
and
must
have
roll
from
top
to
bottom
of
the
sharp
descent
.
<EOS>
cautiously
approach
the
edge
of
the
declivity
,
to
his
infinite
astonishment
and
vexation
he
behold
the
bold
horseman
rapidly
descend
the
steep
escarpment
,
apparently
with
perfect
ease
and
security
.
<EOS>
the
rider
seem
to
trust
himself
entirely
to
his
horse
,
not
attempt
to
direct
him
,
but
leave
him
to
take
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
all
he
do
be
to
lean
back
as
much
as
he
could
in
the
saddle
to
avoid
slide
out
of
it
on
to
the
horse
’s
shoulder
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
he
have
accomplish
nearly
half
the
descent
.
<EOS>
the
sight
stung
Stelfax
to
the
quick
.
<EOS>
His
prey
he
now
feel
would
escape
him
.
<EOS>
if
the
fugitive
should
reach
the
bottom
in
safety
,
his
escape
be
inevitable
.
<EOS>
long
before
the
valley
could
be
gain
by
any
secure
descent
,
he
would
be
far
out
of
harm
’s
way
,
and
Stelfax
,
fearless
and
venturesome
as
he
be
,
do
not
like
to
essay
this
perilous
descent
,
not
deem
his
horse
sufficiently
sure-
<EOS>
footed
to
accomplish
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
one
way
of
arrest
the
fugitive
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
take
a
pistol
from
his
holster
,
and
fire
.
<EOS>
His
mark
have
not
be
the
Cavalier
,
but
his
steed
.
<EOS>
the
ball
lodge
in
the
gallant
animal
’s
brain
.
<EOS>
instantly
quit
the
almost
slide
posture
he
have
assume
,
he
spring
with
a
slight
bind
in
the
air
,
and
then
drop
.
<EOS>
the
Cavalier
have
manage
to
disengage
himself
from
the
saddle
,
but
fall
in
the
attempt
,
and
could
not
recover
his
footing
.
<EOS>
He
and
his
slaughtered
steed
roll
together
to
the
bottom
of
the
declivity
,
where
both
lie
motionless
.
<EOS>
“We

have
Abijam

Stelfax
to
his

who
by

have
come
up

the
Guests
at

Poynings
'
ArmsON
reach
the
valley
,
Stelfax
,
closely
follow
by
Nathan
Guestling
,
ride
towards
the
spot
where
the
luckless
Cavalier
be
lie
.
<EOS>
hitherto
,
he
have
not
move
;
but
when
the
Roundheads
draw
near
,
he
begin
to
exhibit
some
symptom
of
animation
,
and
make
an
effort
to
regain
his
foot
.
<EOS>
the
exertion
,
however
,
be
too
much
for
him
,
and
he
sink
back
with
a
groan
.
<EOS>
fling
himself
from
his
horse
,
and
give
the
bridle
to
Guestling
,
Stelfax
bent
over
the
prostrate
Cavalier
,
and
carefully
study
his
feature
.
<EOS>
the
result
of
this
examination
be
by
no
means
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
the
person
under
his
scrutiny
be
some
ten
year
old
than
Charles
Stuart
,
though
his
slight
figure
and
swarthy
complexion
,
fine
black
eye
,
and
long
dark
lock
,
have
give
him
a
general
resemblance
to
the
youthful
monarch
.
<EOS>
on
close
inspection
,
however
,
the
likeness
vanish
,
and
the
stranger
’s
lineament
be
find
to
be
different
in
many
point
from
those
of
the
king
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
give
vent
to
his
disappointment
in
a
loud
and
angry
exclamation
,
and
call
out
to
the
two
other
trooper
,
who
ride
up
at
the
moment
,
that
it
be
not
Abijam
after
all
.
<EOS>
hear
what
pass
,
the
prostrate
Cavalier
raise
himself
upon
his
elbow
,
and
cry
,
"
<EOS>
so
you
take
me
for
the
king
—
ha
!
<EOS>
no
wonder
you
give
me
so
hot
a
chase
.
<EOS>
learn
to
your
confusion
that
his
Majesty
be
safe
from
pursuit
,
and
never
likely
to
fall
into
rebellious
hand
.
<EOS>
”“so
<EOS>
your
friend
,
Lord
Wilmot
,
affirm
,
Sir
,
"
rejoin
Stelfax
;
"
but
I
attach
little
credit
to
his
assertion
,
and
I
attach
no
more
to
yours
.
<EOS>
You
be
my
prisoner
.
<EOS>
under
what
name
and
title
<EOS>
do
you
surrender?”“It
be
my
pleasure
to
guard
my
incognito
as
long
as
I
can
,
"
the
Cavalier
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
therefore
decline
to
furnish
you
with
my
name
.
<EOS>
as
to
title
,
I
have
none
.
<EOS>
”“You
be
too
modest
,
methink
,
sir
,
"
Stelfax
cry
.
<EOS>
"
remain
unknown
,
if
you
will
,
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
not
treat
with
the
consideration
due
to
your
rank
,
you
have
only
yourself
to
blame
.
<EOS>
”“I
have
no
rank
whatever
,
I
repeat
,
"
the
Cavalier
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
but
a
simple
gentleman
—
and
a
very
poor
gentleman
into
the
bargain
—
thank
to
the
fine
and
confiscation
of
your
State
Council
.
<EOS>
Will
one
of
your
man
lend
a
hand
to
lift
me
up?”“I
will
do
as
much
for
you
myself
,
sir
,
"
Stelfax
reply
,
help
him
to
his
foot
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
be
not
much
hurt?”“No
bone
be
break
,
I
think
,
"
say
the
other
;
"
but
I
be
a
good
deal
shake
.
<EOS>
You
give
me
rather
an
awkward
tumble
down
the
hill
—
but
I
should
not
heed
that
if
my
horse
have
be
spare
,
"
glance
,
as
the
word
be
utter
,
with
great
commiseration
at
the
body
of
the
poor
animal
lie
stark
beside
him
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
gallant
steed
!
<EOS>
I
shall
never
get
such
another
.
<EOS>
”“a
<EOS>
brave
horse
,
in
sooth
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
sorry
to
despatch
him
—
but
I
must
have
shoot
him
or
you
.
<EOS>
You
may
,
however
,
console
yourself
for
the
loss
by
reflect
that
you
will
never
more
,
in
all
likelihood
,
require
his
service
.
<EOS>
”“that
be
but
cold
comfort
,
"
the
other
rejoin
.
<EOS>
"
however
,
we
cavalier
be
not
accustom
to
despair
,
even
at
the
foot
of
the
scaffold
.
<EOS>
I
hope
to
give
you
another
run
as
good
as
the
one
<EOS>
you
,
have
just
enjoy
—
with
this
difference
only
,
that
on
the
next
occasion
you
may
be
leave
in
the
lurch
.
<EOS>
”“many
<EOS>
a
fox
-
chase
have
be
less
exciting
,
no
doubt
,
"
say
Stelfax
,
enter
into
the
jest
.
<EOS>
"
but
you
must
now
submit
to
be
search
by
my
man
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
regret
that
the
measure
can
not
be
dispense
with
—
but
my
order
be
strict
.
<EOS>
all
letter
and
paper
must
be
send
to
head
-
quarter
—
and
perhaps
I
may
learn
at
the
same
time
whom
I
have
the
honour
of
addressing
.
<EOS>
”Due
precaution
against
a
contingency
like
the
present
must
have
be
take
by
the
Cavalier
,
since
only
a
few
unimportant
article
be
find
upon
him
,
and
nothing
whatever
to
afford
a
clue
to
his
identity
.
<EOS>
see
the
prisoner
look
very
faint
,
and
scarcely
able
to
stand
,
though
he
utter
no

Stelfax

him

on

by
a
broad

<EOS>
He
then
direct
Mattathias
and
Enoch
to
ride
one
on
either
side
of
the
captive
,
to
prevent
the
possibility
of

,
and
set
off
for

close
at

where

—
a

who
from
his
extraordinary
piety

austerity
be

round
the

with

beyond
which
none
of
them
could
stray
,
neither
could
any
enemy
approach
them

the

render
their

;
and
thenceforward
,
whenever
grass
be
cut

dry
within
that
meadow
,
rain
would
fall
upon
it

and
turn
it

<EOS>
such

a

<EOS>

you
will
perceive
,
whom
it
be
necessary
to
treat
with
the
respect

at
a
later
period

when
he
have
build
a
wooden
church
with
his

at

wherein
,
in
the
fulness
of
time
,
he
be
inter

and
when
his
reputation
for
sanctity
and
austerity
have
greatly

him
to

dreaded

I

by
evil

to
whom
he

obnoxious
—
the
holy
man
walk
forth
one
afternoon
,
in

wholly
unattende

across

his
purpose
be
to
visit
a

Sister

who
dwelt
in
a
solitary
cell
on
the
summit
of
a
hill
adjoin

whom
he
have
be
tell
be
sick
,
and
desirous
of
be
shriven
by
him
.
<EOS>
now
Saint
Cuthman
have
his
staff
in
his
hand
,
without
which
he
never
journey
abroad
,
and
he
walk
on
until
he
reach
the
eminence
for
which
he
be
bind
.
<EOS>
on
the
brow
of
this
hill
in
former
time
the
heathen
invader
of
the
land
have
make
a
camp
,
vestige
of
which
may
still
be
discern
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
with
these
memorial
of
a
bygone

benighted
people
that
Saint
Cuthman
concern
himself
.
<EOS>
if
he
think
about
the
framer
of
those
mighty
earthwork
at
all

it
be
with
thanksgiving
that
they

”The

take
up
the

”After
go
through
certain
other
ceremonial
,
which
it
be
needless
to
describe
,
the
Saint
sit
down
,
and
address
Sister
Ursula
,
declare
his
readiness
to
shrive
her
.
<EOS>
the
recluse
then
knelt
down
before
him
,
and
incline
her
head
so
as
to
conceal
her
feature
,
say
she
have
one
secret
within
her
breast
which
she
have
never
reveal
to
her
confessor
—
one
sin
upon
her
soul

of
which
she
have
never

after
duly
reprove
her

clean
her

the
poor
recluse

who
shed
abundance

in
the
negative

the
Saint
give
her
absolution

say
that
the
penance

ere

cheerful

<EOS>
Saint
Cuthman
tarry
in

discourse
with

glorious
prospect

<EOS>
tell
the
good

never

<EOS>
as
he
take
his
way
towards
the
north

eastern
boundary
of
the
ancient
encampment

a
noise
resemble
thunder
smote
his
ear

the
ground
shake
so
violently
beneath

that
he

scarcely

reel
to

remain
unmoved

the
only
human
witness

the
astounding
scene

<EOS>
the
Fiend

proportion
have

colossal

and
he
look
like
one
of

giant
race

poet

Jove

<EOS>
His
garb
be

visible
on
his

again

<EOS>
this
cause
him
to
snort
and
roar
like
a
mad
bull

and
so
much
flame

smoke
issue
from
his
mouth
and
nostril
,
that
the
bottom
of
the
Dyke
resemble
the
bed
of
a
volcano

<EOS>
Sister
Ursula
then
turn
the
glass
for
the
fourth
time

<EOS>
Hereupon
,
an
enormous
mass
of
breccia
,
or
gold

stone
,
as
the
common
folk
call
it
,
which
the
Fiend
have
dislodge
,
roll
down
upon
his
foot

crush
it

this
so
enrage
him

that

send
the
fragment

gold

stone
whizzing
over

what
with
rub
his
bruise
foot

and
roar
,
a
quarter
of
an
hour
elapse
before
he
could
resume
his
work

<EOS>
the
fifth
turning
of
the

give
him
such
pain
in
the
back
,
that
for
some
minute
he
be
completely
disabled

I

”“I

It

a

on
without
intermission

fill
the

flame
from
his
fiery
nostril

a
continuous
thunderstorm
over

Weald

CHAPTER
VHow
Stelfax
take
the
cavalier
to
the
grange;and
<EOS>
what
happen
by
the
waysome
few
interruption
be
offer
to
the
schoolmaster
’s
narration
both
by
Stelfax
and
his
man
;
and
when
it
come
to
an
end
,
the
Roundhead
leader
observe
that
it
be
a
monkish
and
superstitious
legend
,
fit
only
for
old
wife
and
child
,
and
that
for
his
own
part
he
do
not
believe
in
the
pretended
miracle
of
Saint
Cuthman
,
or
those
of
any
other
Romish
saint
in
the
calendar
.
<EOS>
on
this
observation
be
make
,
Captain
Goldspur
get
up
,
and
look
as
if
he
would
no
longer
remain
in
the
company
of
a
person
who
express
such
heterodox
opinion
,
he
be
march
out
of
the
room
,
when
,
at
a
sign
from
Stelfax
,
two
of
the
trooper
catch
hold
of
him
,
and
force
him
back
to
his
seat
.
<EOS>
in
do
this
,
they
deprive
him
of
his
long
rapier
,
which
Stelfax
consign
to
the
host
,
bid
him
put
it
aside
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
in
an
authoritative
tone
the
Roundhead
leader
then
inform
the
company
that
none
of
them
must
leave
the
house
until
after
his
departure
with
the
prisoner
—
a
piece
of
good
news
to
Simon
Piddinghoe
,
who
venture
to
express
a
hope
that
the
worshipful
captain
would
prolong
his
stay
to
as
late
an
hour
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
,
indeed
,
seem
in
no
hurry
to
depart
.
<EOS>
His
seat
by
the
fireside
be
very
comfortable
,
and
the
mulled
sack
super
-
excellent
—
so
remarkably
good
,
indeed
,
that
,
have
finish
his
pottle
during
the
progress
of
the
schoolmaster
’s
legend
,
he
order
the
host
to
brew
a
second
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
the
prisoner
have
shake
off
in
a
great
measure
the
effect
of
his
fall
.
<EOS>
of
a
reckless
turn
,
like
most
cavalier
,
he
either
feel
—
or
feign
to
feel
—
indifferent
to
his
present
position
.
<EOS>
His
chair
be
next
that
of
Stelfax
,
and
hear
the
praise
bestow
by
the
latter
upon
the
sack
,
he
beg
to
be
allow
a
measure
for
himself
—
and
the
favour
be
unhesitatingly
grant
.
<EOS>
after
the
failure
of
his
attempt
to
march
off
,
Captain
Goldspur
’s
audacity
seem
to
forsake
him
,
and
withdraw
as
far
as
he
could
from
the
presence
of
the
hateful
Stelfax
,
he
lapse
into
gloomy
silence
.
<EOS>
His
companion
be
equally
taciturn
and
moody
.
<EOS>
but
the
rest
of
the
company
take
no
umbrage
at
their
detention
,
appear
rather
pleased
by
the
excuse
it
offer
them
for
make
a
night
of
it
.
<EOS>
whether
Stelfax
sit
long
to
vex
Goldspur
and
his
sullen
comrade
—
or
whether
,
as
be
more
probable
,
he
feel
disposed
to
rest
and
enjoy
himself
after
a
hard
day
’s
work
—
<EOS>
certain
it
be
that
eleven
o'clock
have
strike
ere
<EOS>
he
rise
to
depart
.
<EOS>
the
reckoning
be
then
pay
—
rather
to
Simon
Piddinghoe
’s
surprise
,
for
the
soldier
of
the
Republic
be
not
notorious
for
scrupulously
discharge
their
score
;
the
horse
be
bring
out
;
the
prisoner
be
place
on
the
crupper
behind
Nathan
Guestling
,
and
strap
to
that
stout
trooper
as
he
have
previously
be
.
<EOS>
all
these
arrangement
make
,
Stelfax
mount
,
and
after
partake
of
a
stirrup
-
cup
proffer
by
the
host
,
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
little
troop
,
and
ride
out
of
Poynings
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
Roundhead
leader
<EOS>
’s
injunction
to
the
contrary
,
one
person
have
contrive
to
slip
out
of
the
house
unobserved
.
<EOS>
when
the
host
return
to
his
guest
to
tell
them
they
be
now
free
to
depart
if
they
be
so
minded
,
he
remark
that
Captain
Goldspur
be
go
,
and
have
take
his
rapier
with
him
.
<EOS>
upon
which
he
mutter
,
"

”“Why

and
fling
a
double

crown
upon
the
table
he
rush
out
of
the
house
,
follow
by
his
comrade
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
clear
starlight
night
,
and
by
no

dark
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
keep
a
little
in
advance
of
his
man
,
but
do
not
urge
his
horse
beyond
a
walk
.
<EOS>
Their
road
lie
partly
along
a

partly
over

after

<EOS>
He

in

of
thunder

<EOS>
deem

I

but
as
they
have

<EOS>
the

vociferate
loudly
,

make
as
much
noise

and
though
the
thick
wall
of
the
chamber

still
the

therefore
,
be
make
for
his
liberation
.
<EOS>
through
the
agency
of
Martin
Geere
and
Giles
Moppett
,
who
be
employ
by
the
colonel
in
preparation
for
this
project
,
the
whole
of
the
household
be
secretly
armed
,
and
command
to
hold
themselves
in
readiness
,
in
case
the
attempt
could
be
make
with
any
prospect
of
success
.
<EOS>
so
long
as
the
Ironsides
maintain
an
impose
force
,
and
,
indeed
,
outnumber
the
colonel
’s
retainer
,
any
such
attempt
would
have
be
fraught
with
the
great
risk
;
but
when
Stelfax
set
off
to
the
church
,
take
half
a
dozen
man
with
him
,
and
leave
but
a
slend
guard
of
three
or
four
behind
—
of
which
Colonel
Maunsel
be
make
aware
by
Moppett
—
then
it
seem
to
the
old
Cavalier
that
the
right
moment
have
arrive
.
<EOS>
but
Moppett
have
a
plan
of
his
own
for
render
the
matter
quite
certain
.
<EOS>
with
the
aid
of
his
fellow
-
servant
,
he
undertake
to
secure
three
of
the
ironside
in
the
cellar
,
whither
he
know
they
be
about
to
go
,
and
besought
his
master
to
wait
till
he
could
carry
the
plan
into
effect
.
<EOS>
though
anxious
for
the
onset
,
Colonel
Maunsel
agree
to
the
delay
—
or
rather
,
allow
himself
to
be
persuade
by
Mr.
Beard
to
adopt
this
prudent
course
.
<EOS>
the
good
clergyman
and
his
daughter
have
remain
with
the
colonel
to
a
late
hour
,
and
find
it
be
his
intention
to
watch
throughout
the
night
,
Mr.
Beard
desire
permission
to
keep
him
company
,
and
of
course
the
request
could
not
be
refuse
.
<EOS>
Dulcia
be
unwilling
to
leave
her
father
—
and
Patty
do
not
like
to
quit
her
young
mistress
—
so
they
all
remain
in
an
upper
room
,
which
Colonel
Maunsel
have
choose
for
himself
when
drive
from
his
own
chamber
by
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
within
this
room
the
colonel
be
pace
to
and
fro
,
support
by
Martin
Geere
,
scarcely
able
to
control
his
impatience
,
and
eagerly
expect
Moppett
’s
appearance
,
when
the
report
of
a
pistol
,
almost
instantly
follow
by
two
other
shot
,
suddenly
smote
his
ear
.
<EOS>
draw
his
sword
,
he
hasten
,
without
support
,
along
the
corridor
to
the
head
of
the
stair
,
follow
somewhat
more
cautiously
by
the
other
.
<EOS>
Patty
Whinchat
have
snatch
up
a
taper
before
quit
the
room
,
and
other
of
the
household
,
when
issue
from
the
buttery
and
kitchen
,
have
bring
lamp
with
them
,
so
there
be
now
light
enough
to
reveal
the
disguise

near
the
door

<EOS>
deceive
by
their
accoutrement

old
Cavalier
take
them
for
parliamentary
soldier
,
and
naturally
conclude
they
be
march
off
with
the
prisoner

<EOS>
but
his
blood
be
now
up
,
and
although
Mr.
Beard
beseech
him
not
to
interfere
<EOS>
and
so
jeopardize
his
own
safety
,
he
shout
out
to
the
suppose
Roundheads
to
set
free
their
prisoner
instantly

<EOS>
then
turn
to
his

vociferated,“Upon

therefore

through

We

<EOS>
a
door
on

be
burst
open

and
in
rushed
Stelfax
and
his
man

<EOS>
though
the
place
be
obscure
,
the
light
of
the
moon
betray
Clavering
to
his
foe
,
and
the
infuriate
Roundhead
leader
make
a
bound
towards
him
like
that
of

tiger

he
be
balk
of

pursuer
by
John
Habergoen

<EOS>
the
door
could
be

on

there

<EOS>
the

tone

he
deem
it
prudent
to

and
decamp
just
in
time
to
avoid
the
lodgement
of
a
bullet
in

all

Clavering

<EOS>
guess
what

yet
anxious

they
ride
towards
the
garden
gate

the
satisfaction
to

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
on
behold
the

Lord

call
upon
his
companion
to
follow
him

charge
the
Roundheads

resolve
to

down

the
Ironside
leader
do
not

the
attack

<EOS>
His

the
carabine
of

have
be
discharge

<EOS>
He
therefore
give
the
word
to
retreat
into

and
the
command
be
promptly
obey

<EOS>
satisfied
with
this
success

and
not

the
struggle

the
Royalists
content
themselves
with

both
Colonel

Clavering

of
the
plan

<EOS>
John

undertake
to
get
them
secretly
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
to
reach
Alfriston
,
they
must
proceed
by
Newhaven
;
for

<EOS>
although
the
former
village
lie
a
few
mile
to
the
south
-
east
of
the
little
seaport
at
the
mouth
of
the
Ouse
,
the
river
have
to
be
cross
,
and
this
could
only
be
accomplish
either
by
the
ferry
at
Newhaven
or
the
bridge
at
Lewes
.
<EOS>
towards
Newhaven
,
therefore
,
they
direct
their
course
.
<EOS>
the
night
be
clear
and
calm
,
and
a
crescent
moon
hang
like
a
lamp
in
the
deep
starlit
vault
.
<EOS>
It
be
about
the
second
hour
after
midnight
,
and
have
any
one
see
the
troop
career
over
the
down
at
that
lonesome
time
,
they
may
have
be
judge
to
be
bent
on
some
dark
design
.
<EOS>
but
to
newly

escape
captive
,
as
they
all
be
,
the
sense
of
freedom
be
inexpressibly
delightful
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
principle
with
the
Cavaliers
to
banish
care
,
and
make
the
most
of
the
passing
moment
,
they
all
appear
in
good
spirit

<EOS>
the
fineness
of
the
night
,
the
fresh
air
,
and
the
pleasant
and
wholesome
exercise
so
exhilarate
them
,
that
Lord
Wilmot
and
Colonel
Gunter
soon
become
quite
cheerful
,
and
even
Clavering
shake
off
his
misgiving
.
<EOS>
pursue
their
way
,
in
the
first
instance
,
along
the
undulate
ridge
of
the
hill
trend
towards
the
coast
,
they
pass
an
ancient
barrow
,
and
a
fire-
beacon
contiguous
to
it
,
which
latter
occupy
the
site
of
the
present
windmill
,
until
they
come
to
the
Newhaven
road
,
skirting
which

and
keep
on
the
turf
,
they
descend
the
gentle
declivity
dip
into
Rottingdean
.
<EOS>
and
here
we
may
,
parenthetically
,
remark
,
that
no
more
delightful
ride
or
walk
can
be
find
in
any
part
of
the

than
be
to

the

CHAPTER
IVThe
"
Star
"
at
AlfristonTHE
Star
at
Alfriston
,
happily
still
exist
,
be
one
of
the
good
specimen
to
be
meet
with
of
an
ancient
english
hostelry
.
<EOS>
date
back
as
far
as
the
early
part
of
the
sixteenth
century
,
this
curious
old
building
be
originally
design
as
a
resting
-
place
for
pilgrim
and
mendicant
friar
,
and
be
mean
,
moreover
,
to
afford
sanctuary
to
such
as
claim
ecclesiastical
protection
.
<EOS>
the
woodwork
of
the
ancient
hostelry
be
enrich
with
quaint
and
grotesque
carving
,
all
of
which
be
imbue
with
mediæval
character
and
spirit
.
<EOS>
on
either
side
of
the
wide
-
arched
portal
be
saintly
figure
,
and
under
the
window
of
the
door
may
be
see
two
snake
with
tail
entwine
.
<EOS>
at
a
corner
of
the
structure
be
a
large
carved
lion
,
and
over
it
two
ape
sustain
a
mace
crown
.
<EOS>
near
the
sign
-
post
there
use
to
be
a
dog
,
and
beside
it
a
bacchanalian
figure
with
bottle
and
glass
—
but
these
,
and
doubtless
many
other
equally
curious
memorial
of
the
past
,
be
go
.
<EOS>
within
,
there
be
other
trace
of
antiquity
.
<EOS>
on
the
main
beam
of
the
principal
room
be
a
shield
,
inscribe
with
the
sacred
character
I.H.S.How
<EOS>
it
come
to
pass
at
a
period
like
that
in
which
our
Tale
be
lay
,
when
all
ecclesiastical
ornament
be
mutilate
or
destroy
by
bigot
and
fanatic
,
that
such
decoration
as
be
possess
by
the
old
hostelry
of
Alfriston
should
have
be
spare
,
we
pretend
not
to
determine
.
<EOS>
such
must
have
be
the
case
,
since
they
be
still
preserve
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
inhabitant
of
the
village
be
less
bigoted
than
their
neighbour
,
or
they
may
have
respect
the
idolatrous
carving
of
the
inn
out
of
regard
for
the
worthy
host
.
<EOS>
honest
Stephen
Buxted
brew
such
good
ale
,
sell
such
good
wine
,
and
trim
his
sail
so
dexterously
,
that
he
find
favour
with
both
faction
.
<EOS>
secretly
,
however
,
his
inclination
be
for
the
Royalists
,
by
whom
,
as
we
have
intimate
,
he
be
trust
;
many
fugitive
cavalier
have
at
various
time
find
refuge
beneath
his
roof
.
<EOS>
dawn
be
just
break
as
the
little
cavalcade
enter
Alfriston
.
<EOS>
slacken
their
pace
,
they
ride
through
the
village
as
quietly
as
they
could
,
be
anxious
not
to
disturb
the
slumber
of
the
inhabitant
.
<EOS>
the
fine
old
cruciform
church
,
with
its
lofty
spire
,
round
which
the
jackdaw
be
already
wheel
,
make
the
welkin
re
with
their
cawing
,
rear
itself
before
them
.
<EOS>
but
neither
on
this
ancient
structure
,
nor
on
the
mutilated
stone
-
cross
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
street
,
do
the
Royalists
bestow
much
attention
.
<EOS>
Their
object
be
to
gain
secret
admittance
to
the
hostelry
,
they
do
not
halt
before
the
front
door
,
but
turn
down
a
lane
at
the
side
of
the
house
,
and
at
once
proceed
to
the
stable
.
<EOS>
here
John
Habergeon
,
in
fulfilment
of
his
promise
,
quickly
manage
to
knock
up
the
ostler
,
who
,
as
soon
as
he
recognize
him
,
come
forth
and
help
to
convey
their
steed
to
the
stall
.
<EOS>
while
this
be
go
on
,
Stephen
Buxted
make
his
appearance
at
the
back
door
of
the
hostelry
,
anxious
to
know
what
guest
have
thus
unexpectedly
arrive
,
but
be
completely
in
dishabille
,
have
only
just
spring
out
of

,
he
do
not
care
to
venture
forth
in
the
chilly
air
.
<EOS>
see
a
republican
soldier
,
as
he
suppose
,
issue
from
the
stable
,
honest
Stephen
be
about
to
beat
a
hasty
retreat
,
and
shut
the
door
after
him
,
when
Clavering
—
for
he
it
be
who
have
come
forth
—
arrest
him
by
call
out
,
in
the
Cavaliers
’
shibboleth
,
that
he
be
a
friend
of
Cæsar

<EOS>
“a

<EOS>
mutter
buxted

<EOS>
"

upon
me

he
add
,
aloud
.
<EOS>
"
be
you

you

you

<EOS>
You
must
tarry
for
an
hour
or
two
within
the

and
make
shift
with
clean
straw
for
a

<EOS>
”So

he

about
to

<EOS>
cry
the

pause

<EOS>
"
surely
it
can

be
Master
Clavering
Maunsel

Grange?”“You
<EOS>
have
guess
aright
,
Buxted
,
"
<EOS>
the
young
man
reply
,
advance
towards
him
,
so
as
to
afford
the
host
a
well
view
of
his
feature
;
and
he
then
add
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
I
and
some
friend
have
come
to
take
shelter
with
you
,
and
if
you
can
accommodate
us
,
it
be
possible
we
may
remain
with
you
for
a
few
day
—
perhaps
a
week
.
<EOS>
”“You
and
your
friend
shall
be
welcome
,
good
Master
Clavering
,
"
the
host
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
trust
all
be
well
with
your
honoured
father
.
<EOS>
I
need
scarcely
say
that
the
son
of
Colonel
Maunsel
shall
have
the
good
entertainment
my
poor
house
afford
.
<EOS>
”“Any
entertainment
will
suffice
for
me
,
Buxted
,
"
clavering
rejoin
;
"
but
there
be
one
with
me
whose
high
rank
demand
more
than
ordinary
care
.
<EOS>
”“high
<EOS>
rank
,
say
you
,
Master
Clavering

"
cry
the
host
.
<EOS>
"
surely
,
it
be
not
our
gracious

<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
if
it
should
be

he
shall
be
welcome
to
all
Stephen
Buxted
<EOS>
possesses!”“I
know
your
loyalty

devotion

my
worthy

Clavering
reply
.
<EOS>
"
but
this
be
not
the
king
.
<EOS>
I
would
it
be
!
<EOS>
he
could
not
be
in
well
hand
than
yours
.
<EOS>
but
if
your
sovereign
will
not
lodge
with
you
,
you
will
have
one
of
his
Majesty
’s
trusty
adviser
as
your
guest
.
<EOS>
and
who
know
but
ere
long
you
may
have
the
king
himself
beneath
your
roof!”“it
would

indeed
,
delight
me

an
opportunity
of
testify
my

<EOS>
cry
buxte

<EOS>
"
but
bid
your
friend
come
in
at
once
,
and
do
not
remain
out
there
in
the
yard
.
<EOS>
I
hope
your
entrance
into
the
village
may
not
have
be
observe
,
for
we
have
many
curious
gossip
in
Alfriston
,
though
they
be
,
for
the
most
part
,
well
affected
towards
the
king
.
<EOS>
I
will
say
that
for
them
.
<EOS>
”“so
<EOS>
far
as
I
can
judge
,
our
arrival
have
be
wholly
unnoticed

"
say
Clavering
.
<EOS>
"
We
do
not
encounter
a
soul
in
the
street
,
and
no
one
that
I
observe
look
forth
at
us

<EOS>
but
I
will
now
go
and
fetch
my
friend
.
<EOS>
”“And
I
will
be
with
them
in
a
moment
,
"
the
host
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
but
go
upstairs
and
put
on
a
few
clothe
,
that
I
may
attend
upon
them
more
decorously

<EOS>
”With
<EOS>
this
he
disappear
,
while
Clavering
cross
over
to
the
stable
,
and
presently
return
with
the
rest
of
the
party
,
all
of
whom
enter
the
house
.
<EOS>
as
our
young
friend
know
his
way
to
the
parlour
,
he
do
not
wait
for
the
host
to
conduct
him
thith
,
but
usher
Lord
Wilmot
and
Colonel
Gunter
into
the
room

where
in
another
minute
they
be
join

the
host

who
by
this
time
have
manage
to
put
on
his
doublet

<EOS>
to
honest
Buxted
’s
inquiry
as
to
what
he
could
bring
them

his
guest
reply
that
what
they
need
most
be
rest

<EOS>
accordingly
,
he
lead
them
at
once
to
sleep
apartment
,
of
which
there
be
,
luckily
,
several
unoccupied
in
the
house

and
he
undertake
to
hide
their
martial
accoutrement
,
as
soon
as
they
should
have
take
them
off

<EOS>
Ere
long
the
whole
party

have
place
their
head
upon
the
pillow
,
lose
the
recollection
of
their
peril
and
fatigue

for

a

strict

them
throughout
the
whole
district
by
the
ironside

but
such
be
the
precaution
take
by
Buxted
,
and
so
great
the
vigilance

fidelity
of
his

that
,
though
on
one
occasion
a
party
of
trooper
actually
come

remain
there
more
than
an
hour

subject
the

all
their

interrogatory

they
fail

<EOS>
on
the
second
night
,
Lord
Wilmot
take
leave

success
.
<EOS>
at
the
expiration
of
a
week
the
two
Cavaliers
begin
to
tire
of
the
inactive
life
they
be
lead
.
<EOS>
clavering
’s
wound
have
nearly
heal
,
and
he
have
quite
recover
the
use
of
his
arm
,
so
that
he
be
now
fit
for
any
service
.
<EOS>
They
therefore
resolve
to
quit
their
present
asylum
,
and
proceed
to
Racton
.
<EOS>
but
the
ironside
be
still
as
much
on
the
alert
as
ever
,
it
behove
them
to
be
exceedingly
cautious
in
their
movement
.
<EOS>
disguise
be
therefore
procure
for
them
by
Stephen
Buxted
,
of
such
kind
as
would
be
most
likely
to
elude
suspicion
;
but
,
for
great
security
,
they
start
on
their
journey
soon
after
midnight
,
and
on
foot
.
<EOS>
We
shall
find
them
at
a
halting
-
place
on
their
way
ere
long
;
but
,
meanwhile
,
we
may
mention
that
Eustace
Saxby
have
leave
them
to
pay
a
stealthy
visit
to
Ovingdean
Grange
,
and
ascertain
how
matter
be
go
on
there
;
and
that
John
Habergeon
be
to
make
a
last
attempt
on
that
very
night
to
hire
a
vessel
at
Newhaven
,
the
result
of
which
he
have
undertake
to
communicate

CHAPTER
VHow
Mr.
Beard
and
Dulcia
be
<EOS>
TakenAs
Hostages
for
Colonel
MaunselIT
will
now
be
necessary
to
go
back
to
the
night
on
which
the
Royalists
make
their
escape
from
Stelfax
,
in
order
to
see
how
that
officer
comport
himself
after
the
loss
of
his
prey
.
<EOS>
He
return
to
the
house
breathing
vengeance
against
all
those
who
have
aid
the
prisoner
in
their
flight
—
foremost
amongst
whom
be
Colonel
Maunsel
.
<EOS>
the
execution
,
however
,
of
his
vindictive
scheme
be
defer
till
the
morrow
,
his
chief
desire
at
present
being
,
if
possible
,
to
recapture
the
fugitive
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
the
Royalists
have
foresee
great
delay
be
experience
in
catch
the
horse
,
and
even
when
this
point
be
achieve
,
for
some
time
the
bridle
and
saddle
could
not
be
find
.
<EOS>
but
although
nearly
an
hour
be
thus
waste
,
the
infuriate
republican
officer
would
not
relinquish
the
design
of
pursuit
.
<EOS>
submission
to
defeat
be
intolerable
to
him
,
and
so
long
as
a
chance
remain
of
retrieve
his
discomfiture
,
he
be
resolve
not
to
throw
it
away
.
<EOS>
in
less
than
an
hour
,
then
,
after
the
departure
of
the
fugitive
,
he
start
in
pursuit
,
at
the
head
of
some
seven
or
eight
man
.
<EOS>
Delves
be
leave
behind
,
with
order
to
watch
over
the
house
,
and
though
he
plead
hard
to
be
allow
to
accompany
his
leader
,
permission
be
not
grant
him
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
have
note
the
course
take
in
the
first
instance
by
the
fugitive
,
and
gallop
to
Rottingdean
,
ascertain
from
a
fisherman
,
who
have
hear
the
cavalcade
pass
his
cottage
,
that
they
have
go
on
towards
Newhaven
.
<EOS>
to
the
latter
place
,
therefore
,
Stelfax
ride
with
all
possible
dispatch
,
but
his
mortification
and
rage
be
boundless
,
when
,
on
arrive
at
the
ferry
,
he
find
that
the
Royalists
have
get
across
,
and
that
the
boat
be
turn
adrift
.
<EOS>
further
pursuit
be
,
therefore
,
out
of
the
question
,
as
he
be
well
aware
there
be
no
means
of
cross
the
Ouse
nearer
than
the
bridge
at
Lewes
.
<EOS>
after
a
brief
debate
with
himself
,
Stelfax
,
unable
to
brook
the
idea
of
return
empty
-
handed
,
send
back
his
man
to
Ovingdean
,
and
ride
on
alone
by
the
western
side
of
the
level
,
through
Rodmill
and
Kingston
to
Lewes
;
proceed
at
once
to
the
castle
,
where
the
detachment
under
his
command
be
quarter
.
<EOS>
His
first
business
be
to
call
out
one
-
and
-
twenty
man
,
whom
he
divide
into
three
party
,
assign
to
each
a
separate
district
—
thus
one
party
be
instruct
to
make
a
perquisition
of
the
coast
,
from
Seaford
to
Eastbourne
;
another
the
mid
-
country
,
comprehend
Beddingham
,
the
Firle
range
of
down
,
Alciston
,
Selmeston
,
and
Hailsham
;
and
a
third
Mount
Caburn
,
Glynde
,
Laughton
,
and
Ringmer
.
<EOS>
the
man
be
,
in
short
,
to
scour
the
whole
country
to
the
south
-
east
to
Lewes
,
make
a
circuit
of
fifteen
or
twenty
mile
,
or
more
if
need
,
and
not
to
return
without
bring
the
fugitive
with
them
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
Stelfax
’s
intention
to
take
the
command
of
one
of
these
party
,
but
he
begin
to
find
that
fatigue
have
make
some
inroad
even
upon
his
iron
frame
,
and
that
if
he
do
not
allow
himself
repose
he
may
break
down
.
<EOS>
content
himself
,
therefore
,
with
give
such
precise
instruction
to
the
man
as
he
fancy
must
ensure
the
accomplishment
of
his
purpose
,
he
fling
himself
upon
his
hard
soldier
’s
couch
,
and
become
presently
oblivious
of
his
care
.
<EOS>
His
instruction
be
carefully
obey
.
<EOS>
the
whole
district
he
have
indicate
be
traverse
by
his
man
;
but
without
effect
.
<EOS>
no
trace
of
the
fugitive
could
be
detect
.
<EOS>
whither
they
have
go
after
leave
Newhaven
<EOS>
be
a
mystery
that
could
not
be
solve
—
no
one
appear
to
have
see
them
.
<EOS>
even
when
the
pursuer
be
really
on
the
right
scent
,
they
remain
at
fault
.
<EOS>
a
visit
,
as
we
have
already
mention
,
be
pay
to
the
Star
at
Alfriston
;
but
though
the
whole
of
the
fugitive
be
at
that
time
in
the
hostelry
,
they
be
so
well
conceal
that
not
the
slight
suspicion
of
their
propinquity
be
entertain
by
the
ironside
.
<EOS>
in
anticipation
of
a
visit
of
the
kind
,
the
horse
bring
off
by
the
Royalists
have
be
remove
to
an
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
shed
at
some
distance
from
the
inn
.
<EOS>
luckily
,
no
one
in
the
village
have
witness
the
arrival
of
the
fugitive
,
so
betrayal
be
impossible
,
except
by
the
ostler
,
and
there
be
no
fear
of
him
.
<EOS>
from
Alfriston
the
trooper
go
on
to
Wilmington
,
where
of
course
they
do
not
learn
much
.
<EOS>
but
besides
miss
the
object
of
their
quest
,
all
three
party
be
more
than
once
dupe
by
false
intelligence
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
their
disappointment
,
the
search
be
continue
throughout
the
day
,
and
it
be
only
at
nightfall
that
the
three
division
return
to
Lewes
,
and
face
their
wrathful
leader
.
<EOS>
Their
failure
be
a
heavy
blow
to
Stelfax
.
<EOS>
He
have
delay
his
return
to
Ovingdean
till
night
,
hope
to
go
back
in
triumph
.
<EOS>
but
shame
,
and
the
sense
of
discomfiture
,
detain
him
till
the
next
day
,
when
,
determine
to
make
an
impose
appearance
,
he
ride
thither
at
the
head
of
fifty
man
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
,
owe
to
the
exertion
of
the
sergeant
,
discipline
have
be
completely
restore
among
the
man
leave
under
his
charge
.
<EOS>
Helpless
Henly
and
the
two
other
,
who
have
be
guilty
of
insubordination
and
drunkenness
,
be
still
under
arrest
.
<EOS>
delf
be
therefore
able
to
give
a
satisfactory
account
of
himself
to
his
leader
but
it
be
not
equally
satisfactory
to
Stelfax
to
learn
that
Colonel
Maunsel
be
dangerously
ill
,
and
entirely
confine
to
his
bed
.
<EOS>
the
vexation
and
anxiety
undergo
by
the
old
Cavalier
have
prove
too
much
for
him
.
<EOS>
on
the
day
after
his
son
’s
escape
with
the
other
Royalists
,
he
be
unable
to
leave
his
couch
,
and
his
enfeebled
condition
greatly
alarm
those
in
attendance
upon
him
.
<EOS>
no
improvement
have
take
place
in
his
health
,
but
rather
the
reverse
,
when
Stelfax
arrive
at
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
without
make
any
remark
on
the
information
he
have
receive
,
but
determine
to
judge
for
himself
,
the
Ironside
leader
march
at
once
to
the
room
in
which
the
colonel
be
lie
,
and
find
him
support
by
pillow
,
and
look
the
picture
of
death
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Beard
and
Dulcia
be
seat
by
the
couch
,
and
the
former
have
a
Bible
on
his
knee
.
<EOS>
both
arise
as
Stelfax
enter
,
and
the
old
Cavalier
make
an
effort
to
raise
himself
.
<EOS>
for
a
moment
not
a
word
be
say
.
<EOS>
the
stern
republican
officer
fold
his
arm
upon
his
breast
,
and
gaze
steadfastly
,
but
not
without
a
slight
touch
of
compassion
in
his
glance
,
at
the
invalided
,
but
still
noble
-
look
gentleman
before
him
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
said,“I
have
come
to
carry
you
a
prisoner
to
Lewes
,
Colonel
Maunsel
.
<EOS>
be
you
ready
to
go?”“You
must
prepare
a
litter
for
my
transport
,
"
the
old
Cavalier
reply
,
feebly
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
move
a
limb
.
”“surely
<EOS>
,
sir
,
"
cry
Mr.
Beard
to
Stelfax
,
"
if
you
have
any
touch
of
humanity
in
your
composition
you
will
not
attempt
to
move
the
colonel
in
this
state
.
<EOS>
He
will
never
reach
Lewes
alive
.
<EOS>
”Dulcia
<EOS>
cast
a
supplicate
look
at
the
Roundhead
leader
,
but
do
not
speak
.
<EOS>
“waste
not
your
time
in
idle
entreaty
,
my
good
friend
,
"
observe
Colonel
Maunsel
,
feebly
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
ruthless
and
inflexible
character
of
this
man
too
well
to
suppose
him
accessible
to
the
common
dictate
of
humanity
.
<EOS>
take
me
,
sir
,
"
he
continue
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
bid
your
soldier
bear
me
,
live

to
the
grave

”“remove
<EOS>
him
at
your
proper
peril
,
sir
,
"
exclaim
Mr.
Beard
.
<EOS>
"
I
warn
you
again
that
he
be
dangerously
ill
.
<EOS>
if
he
die
by
the
way
,
his
death
will
lie
at
your
door
.
<EOS>
”“such
<EOS>
an
occurrence
,
be
it
to
take
place
,
would
not
trouble
me
much
,
"
Stelfax
rejoin
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
have
no
personal
animosity
to
Colonel
Maunsel
,
who
,
though
an
inveterate
malignant
,
be
a
brave
man
,
and
I
should
be
loth
to
abridge
the
little
life

I
will

therefore

consent
to
leave
him
undisturbed

his
surrender

you
require

sir

Mr.

quickly

I

little
account

”“Not

by
other

those
which
he
allow

<EOS>
under
such
an
arrangement
,
Clavering
Maunsel
and
his

be
not
unlikely
,
he
judge
,
to
pay

to

observe
—
be

while

from

asylum

he
would
have
her
altogether
in
his
power

<EOS>
not
wish
to
alarm
her
and
Mr.

too
much
in
the
first
instance
,
he
have
propose
a

and
be
well
pleased
when
the

Trangmar

in

feel
sure
a

would
be

<EOS>
such
be
some
of
the
motive
that
influence
him
;
but
he
may
have
other
,
for
his
design
be
dark
and
inscrutable
.
<EOS>
but
while
abandon
Ovingdean
Grange
,
Stelfax
deem
it
necessary
that
careful
watch
should
be
keep
over
the
house
,
and
no
one
appear
to
him
—
for
reason
which
he
scarcely
like
to
acknowledge
to
himself
—
to
be
so
well
qualified
for
the
office
of
a
spy
as
the
person
who
have
recently
outmanœuvre
him
—
namely
,
Increase
Micklegift
.
<EOS>
but
where
be
he
to
be
find
?
<EOS>
little
expect
friendly
overture
from
the
man
he
have
injure
,
but
dread
his
vengeance
,
the
Independent

have
flee
.
<EOS>
Stelfax
question
Delves
about
Micklegift
,
and
the

reply
that
there
be
in
the
village
an
elder

Morefruit
Stone

who
he
think
may
be
able
to
communicate
with
the

<EOS>
Stelfax
immediately
catch
at
the
suggestion
,
and
said:“Hie
thee
to

and
say
unto
him

that
if

hath
any
mean

he
may
inform
him
that
I
bear
him
no
malice
for
what
he
hath

do
him
a

and
to
that
end
request
him
to
come
over
to
me
without
delay
to
the
castle
at
Lewes
.
<EOS>
lest
he
suspect
that
,
perchance
,
there
may
be
a

him
,
give
him
a
solemn

the

<EOS>
the
habiliment

moreover
,
if

you

they

the

<EOS>
but
as
there

we
may
state
at

that
they
be

though
the

CHAPTER
viiwhat
happen
at
the
"
Dolphin
"
at
ShorehamOUR
story
must
now
be
advance
about
a
week
beyond
the
foregoing
date
,
which
will
bring
us
to
the
13th
of
October
,
1651
.
<EOS>
on
the
afternoon
of
this
day
,
two
well
-
mount
horseman
,
follow
at
a
respectful
distance
by
a
servant
likewise
on
horseback
,
ride
from
Bramber
towards
Shoreham
.
<EOS>
to
judge
from
their
attire
,
both
horseman
must
be
Roundheads
.
<EOS>
They
wear
neither
lace
cloak
nor
laced
band
.
<EOS>
Their
garment
be
sad
-
coloured
,
and
destitute
of
all
embroidery
,
and
their
hat
tall
and
steeple
-
crown
,
and
lack
feather
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
their
lock
be
crop
close
to
the
head
.
<EOS>
Their
servant
,
a
tall
,
powerful
-
looking
man
,
well
-
stricken
in
year
,
be
habit
as
become
a
follower
of
such
puritanical
-
look
master
.
<EOS>
but
though
the
horseman
be
dress
like
Roundheads
,
their
deportment
,
when
not
in
the
presence
of
witness
,
would
have
lead
to
a
very
different
conclusion
,
and
any
one
who
could
have
listen
to
their
discourse
would
soon
have
learn
that
they
belong
to
the
opposite
faction
.
<EOS>
once
more
we
have
to
announce
our
friend
Colonel
Gunter
and
Clavering
Maunsel
in
a
new
disguise
,
though
it
will
be
scarcely
necessary
,
we
think
,
to
state
that
their
tall
old
serving
-
man
be
John
Habergeon
.
<EOS>
from
its
advantageous
situation
near
the
mouth
of
the
Adur
,
Shoreham
soon
become
one
of
the
principal
harbour
on
the
Sussex
coast
.
<EOS>
at
the
time
of
our
Tale
it
be
much
frequented
,
and
several
sloop
,
with
other
vessel
of
large
tonnage
,
be
now
to
be
see
in
the
haven
.
<EOS>
at
low
water
,
the
embouchure
of
the
Adur
,
which
be
of
some
width
,
be
characterize
by
large
,
glisten
bank
of
mud
,
but
as
the
channel
at
this
time
happen
to
be
full
,
it
present
the
appearance
of
a
broad
and
goodly
river
.
<EOS>
the
ancient
church
,
with
the
habitation
near
it
,
which
could
be
see
on
the
near
bank
of
the
river
,
be
that
of
Old
Shoreham
;
but
it
be
towards
New
Shoreham
and
its
haven
that
our
friend
bend
their
course
.
<EOS>
here
,
as
at
the
old
seaport
,
there
be
a
church
of
great
antiquity
and
beauty
;
and
after
pass
this
noble
structure
—
not
without
bestow
upon
it
a
glance
of
admiration
—
the
disguise
Cavaliers
proceed
to
the
Dolphin
,
an
inn
build
on
the
edge
of
the
quay
,
much
frequent
by
seafare
people
,
and
then

by
one
Absolom

the

friend
enter
the

and
after
order
some
oyster
and
a
bottle
of
sack
,
and
desire
to
be

into
a
private
room
,
Colonel
Gunter
inquire
of
the
host
whether
he

Captain

of
the
Swiftsure

<EOS>
“know

<EOS>
I
have
know
Nick
Tattersall
since
he
be
a

"
<EOS>
exclaim
Bridger
;

and
a
well
seaman
or
an
honester
fellow
do
not
exist

<EOS>
”“Thou
speakest
warmly
of
him
,
friend
Absolom
,
"
reply
Colonel
Gunter
,
think
it
necessary
,
to
support
his
puritanical
character
;
"
but
be
he
in
your
harbour
of
Shoreham
at
present?”“he
<EOS>

here
this
very
morning

"
Bridger
reply
,
"
by
the
same
token
that
he
discuss
a
cup
of
sack
with
an
egg
in
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
but
newly
return
from
Plymouth
,
and
will
soon
make
a
trip
to
Poole
,
in
Dorsetshire
.
<EOS>
”“so
<EOS>
I
have
hear
,
"
reply
Colonel
Gunter
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
commission
to
give
him

would
gladly
speak
with
him

if

”“found
<EOS>

for
it

"
Bridger

.
<EOS>
"
I
will
fetch
him
to
you
anon
,
and
you
shall
have
the
oyster
and
sack
without
delay

<EOS>
”not
<EOS>
many
minute
after
the
host
<EOS>
’s
disappearance
,
the
door
be
suddenly
open
,
and
a
tall

clothe
in

Geneva

wear
a
lofty

peer
inquisitively
into
the
room

<EOS>
His
eye
rest
upon
Clavering
,
who
at
once
recognize
him
,
and
be
about
to
address
him
,
when
the
other
raise
his
finger
to
his
lip
in
token
of
silence
,
hastily
retreat
,
and
close
the
door
.
<EOS>
“Who
be
that
mysterious
personage
?
"
<EOS>
Colonel
Gunter
inquire
,
not
altogether
like
the
intrusion
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
be
not
an
enemy
—
he
evidently
know
you
.
<EOS>
”“I
ought
to
regard
him
as
a
friend
,
see
that
he
once
render
me
a
most
important
service
,
"
Clavering
reply
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
confess
I
distrust
him
,
and
be
sorry
to
see
him
here
.
<EOS>
It
be
Increase
Micklegift
,
who
,
when
our
worthy
Mr.
Beard
be
deprive
of
his
living
at
Ovingdean

succeed
to

<EOS>
He

an
Independent

<EOS>
ever
since
he

Lord
Wilmot

myself

with
the
other
,
to
escape
from
the
church

he
have
never
dare
,
so
<EOS>
I
learn
from
John
Habergeon
,
to
show
himself
at
the
rectory
or
in
the
village
.
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
to
find
him
here
.
<EOS>
”“I
be
sorry
he
recognize
you
,
"
Colonel
Gunter
reply
,
somewhat
thoughtfully
;
"
<EOS>
for
though
he
may
not
suspect
our
errand
,
he
may
be
troublesome
to
us
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
do
not
think
any
danger
be
to
be
apprehend
from
him

"
Clavering

.
<EOS>
"
He
be
in
as
much
jeopardy
as
we
ourselves
be
,
and
if
he
be
to
fall
into
Stelfax
’s
hand
little
clemency
would
be
show
him
.
”“grante
<EOS>
that
his
conduct
have
compromise
him
with

Roundheads

observe
Colonel
Gunter

"
do
you
not

my

may
easily
do

hast
thou
nothing

your

I
should
have
swallow

I

<EOS>
so
say
,
he
produce
a
small
paper
bullet

hand
it
with
the
point
of
his

Colonel

have
unfold

carefully
smooth

“Lord

night

<EOS>
His
lordship
assign
no
reason
for
thus
advance
the
hour
of
departure
;
but
the
king
may
,
perhaps
,
have
take
alarm
at
some
movement
of
the
enemy
,
or
it
may
only
be
a
natural
anxiety

part

get
out

’s
way

<EOS>
be
aught

lordship
tell
me
that

most
ardently

night

"
reply
ninian
,
"
or
early
in
the
morning
,
as
his
Majesty
entertain
the
notion
that
the
moment
will
be
propitious
for
his
escape
,
and
that
,
if
defer
,
ill
consequence
may
ensue
.
<EOS>
”“But
<EOS>
how
be
we
to
carry
out
the
king
’s
wish
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Gunter
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
arrange
with
Tattersall
for
Wednesday
night
,
not
Wednesday
morning
,
and
it
will
be
scarcely
possible
,
I
fear
,
to
prevail
upon
the
stubborn
skipper
to
set
sail
earlier
.
<EOS>
besides
,
the
rascal
stipulate
for
an
interview
with
his
two
passenger
before
he
would
agree
to
convey
them
across
the
Channel
.
”“True
,
"
reply
Clavering
;
"
but
Tattersall
be
a
loyal
fellow
,
and
I
believe
him
to
be
only
desirous
of
satisfy
himself
that
it
be
the
king
who
be
to
sail
with
him
.
<EOS>
have
he
be
trust
,
in
my
opinion
he
would
not
have
make
the
stipulation
;
but
you
do
not
deem
such
a
course
prudent
.
<EOS>
”“I
judge
it
better
not
to
tell
him
too
much
,
"
reply
Gunter
.
<EOS>
"
not
that
I
believe
for
a
moment
that
the
reward
offer
by
the
Council
of
state
would
tempt
him
to
betray
the
king
.
<EOS>
He
be
too
loyal
and
honest
for
such
a
detestable
act
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
penalty
of
high
treason
stare
him
in
the
face
—
when
loss
of
life
and
confiscation
of
property
may
follow
his
complicity
in
a
scheme
like
the
present
—
I
feel
unwilling
to
alarm
him
,
lest
he
may
decline
altogether
.
<EOS>
”“I
have
no
fear
of
him

Clavering

by
the
same
spirit
of
loyalty
as
ourselves
,
he
will
run
all
risk
to
save
his
sovereign

<EOS>
Should
we
hesitate
if
place
in
a
similar
situation
?
<EOS>
Would
the
fear
of
death
affright
us
?
<EOS>
assuredly
not

<EOS>
We
should
rather
rejoice
in
the
opportunity
afford
of
prove
our
loyalty
and
devotion
.
<EOS>
such
I
firmly
believe
to
be
<EOS>
Tattersall
’s
sentiment
.
<EOS>
but
come
what
may
,
he
must
be
ready
to
take
his
Majesty
and
Lord
Wilmot
on
board
to

morrow
night
,
and
to
set
sail
on

follow

I

”“I

at
five
o'clock
in

the

an

a
bumper
of
canary

”So
<EOS>
say
,
he
fill
a
goblet
with
wine
,
and
give
it
to
the
young
falconer
,
who
do
justice
to
the
pledge
propose
to
him

<EOS>
Colonel
Gunter
then
inquire
from
Ninian
whether
his
horse
be
fully
equal
to
the
journey
he
have
to
perform
,
and
be
answer
in
the
affirmative

he
bid
the
young

good

enjoin

<EOS>
Ninian
,
with
much
earnestness

more
modesty

reply
that
he
feel
the
full
responsibility
of
the
task
he
have
undertake

would
discharge
it
to
the
good

take
his
departure

a
quarter

CHAPTER
IIA
Royal
wandererfive
o'clock
have
not
strike
next
morning
,
when
Colonel
Gunter
enter
Clavering
’s
chamber
,
and
find
his
guest
not
only
awake
,
but
fully
attire
and
prepare
for
the
journey
.
<EOS>
so
blithe
be
the
young
man
’s
look
,
that
Colonel
Gunter
could
not
help
comment
upon
them
,
and
say
,
"
I
be
glad
to
see
you
look
so
cheerful
,
my
young
friend

<EOS>
It
show
that
you
calculate
on
success
,
and
I
doubt
not
your
anticipation
will
be
realize

<EOS>
”“Ere
many
hour
have
fly
,
his
Majesty
,
I
hope
,
will
have
quit
these
ungrateful
shore
,
"
say
Clavering
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
feel
assured
that
although
he
be
now
drive
hence
by
the
malice
of
rebel
and
fanatic
,
he
will
return
to
his
kingdom
in
triumph
.
”“Amen

"
<EOS>
reply
Colonel
Gunter
.
<EOS>
"
like
myself
,
I
see
you
be
well
armed

pistol
in
your
belt

rapier
by
your
side
.
<EOS>
I
trust
we
shall
have
no
occasion
to
use
our
weapon
.
<EOS>
but
the
king
shall
never
fall
into
the
hand
of
the
rebel
while
we
have
breath
to
defend
him
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
since
you
be
ready
,
let
us
set
forth
at
once
.
<EOS>
”“With
<EOS>
all
my
heart
,
"
reply
Clavering
;
"
I
be
impatient
to
greet
his
Majesty
on
the
day

I
trust
<EOS>
will
be
that

his
happy
deliverance

”None

Their
attentive

prepare
a
slight

of
it

upon

fortify
their
stomach
against

by
a
glass
of
strong
water
,
at
the
butler
’s
recommendation
.
<EOS>

at
once
to

mount
their

in

Ere

tall

so

so
full

the

drollery

good

swarthy

his

back
so
as
to

Majesty

the
little

manner

the
two
Cavaliers
slacken
their
pace
,
approach
the
royal
wanderer
as
ceremoniously
and
with
as
profound
respect
as
if
he
have
be
surround
by
a
large
retinue
,
and
aid
and
accompany
by
all
the
pomp

Charles
return
their

grace
peculiar
to
him

<EOS>
His
whole
deportment

,
and
notwithstanding
his
sorry
attire
,
he
now
look
every
inch
a
king
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
affable
and
condescend
than
his
manner
,
while
the
air
of
majesty
which
he
cease
not
to
retain
,
heighten
the
effect
of
his
gracious
demeanour
.
<EOS>
“Well
meet
,
gentleman
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
.
<EOS>
"
a
good
morning
to
both
of
you
.
<EOS>
delighted
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
Approach
,
Mr.
Clavering
Maunsel
.
<EOS>
We
have
not
see
you
since
the
night
after
Worcester
’s
luckless
engagement
,
when
,
at
great
personal
risk
,
you
deliver
us
from
imminent
capture
by
the
rebel
.
<EOS>
Approach
,
brave
young
sir
,
that
we
may
tender
our
thank
for
the
service
,
which
,
rest
assured
,
will
never
be
obliterate
from
our
memory
.
<EOS>
”At
<EOS>
this
intimation
,
Clavering
spring
from
his
steed
,
and
give
the
bridle
to
Colonel
Gunter
,
step
forward
,
and
bend
the
knee
reverentially
before
the
young
monarch
,
kiss
the
hand
which
the
latter
extend
towards
him
.
<EOS>
“rise
,
sir
,
"
say
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
greatly
beholden
to
you
,
but
you
must
content
yourself
with
bare
thank
for
the
present
,
our
fallen
estate
not
permit
us
the
mean
of
adequately
reward
service
like
yours
.
<EOS>
but
a
day
may
come
,
and
then
they
shall
not
be
forget
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
what
tiding
do
you
bring
of
your
worthy
father?—he
<EOS>
be
well
<EOS>
,
I
trust
?
<EOS>
and
the
valiant
old
trooper
who
fight
with
him
at
Edge
Hill
and
Naseby
,
and
whom
he
send
with
you
to
Worcester
<EOS>
—
how
be
he
named?—let
<EOS>
me
see
—
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
John
Habergeon
<EOS>
—
how
fare
it
with
the
tough
old
fellow
?
<EOS>
I
trust
no
prick
-
eared
fanatic
have
shorten
his
day
?
<EOS>
We
shall
put
Colonel
Maunsel
’s
loyalty
and
hospitality
to
the
proof
,
for
we
propose
to
pass
a
few
hour
with
him
at
Ovingdean
Grange
before
proceed
to
Shoreham
.
<EOS>
the
visit
,
we
trust
,
can
be
make
without
risk
?
<EOS>
but
these
question
,
and
other
which
we
design
to
put
to
you
,
can
be
answer
more
leisurely
as
we
ride
along
.
<EOS>
so
mount
,
young
sir
,
and
take
a
place
beside
us
.
<EOS>
”and
<EOS>
while
Clavering
hasten
to
obey
his
Majesty
’s
behest
,
Charles
accord
an
equally
gracious
reception
to
Colonel
Gunter
;
with
this
difference
only
,
that
he
allow
the
latter
to
perform
the
ceremony
of
kiss
hand
without
quit
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
the
cavalcade
be
now
once
more
in
motion
,
and
proceed
at
a
trot
along
the
avenue
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Philips
and
Captain
Gunter
ride
in
advance
as
before
,
while
the
rear
be
bring
up
by
Colonel
Gunter
and
Lord
Wilmot
,
the
king
and
Clavering
occupy
the
centre
.
<EOS>
after
a
little
preliminary
discourse
,
Charles
broach
the
subject
of
great
interest
to
himself
,
and
inquire
,
with
an
anxiety
which
he
do
not
attempt
to
conceal
,
whether
Tattersall
’s
vessel
be
engage
,
and
ready
to
sail
that
night
,
or
early
in
the
morning?“the
brig
be
secure
,
as
I
trust
,
sire
,
"
Clavering
reply
;
"
but
arrangement
be
make
for
to
-
morrow
night
,
not
for
the
morning
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
do
not
believe
that
the
early
hour
will
make
much
difference
to
Captain
Tattersall
;
and
our
faithful
messenger
Ninian
Saxby
,
have
already
be
dispatch
to
him
to
expedite
matter
.
”“tattersall
<EOS>
must
start
before
daybreak
to
-
morrow
morning
,
"
say
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
superstitious
enough
to
attach
great
importance
to
the
arrangement
,
and
feel
persuaded
that
delay
will
be
fraught
with
danger
.
”“heaven
<EOS>
forfend
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Clavering
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
we
have
be
sooner
aware
of
your
Majesty
’s
<EOS>
wish
in
this
particular
.
<EOS>
”“that
could
not
easily
be
<EOS>
,
"
reply
the
king
.
<EOS>
"
till
yesterday
I
be
indifferent
to
the
matter
,
but
now
I
be
bent
upon
it
.
<EOS>
”“far
be
it
from
me
to
attempt
to
shake
your
Majesty
’s
resolution
,
"
say
Clavering
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
not
,
I
be
sure
,
feel
so
strong
a
conviction
without
cause
.
<EOS>
and
perhaps
this
acceleration
of
your
plan
may
save
you
from
some
secret
danger
.
<EOS>
”As
<EOS>
he
speak
,
his
thought
involuntarily
revert
to
Micklegift
,
but
he
do
not
think
it
needful
to
mention
his
misgiving
to
the
king
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
previously
prepare
my
father
for
the
honour
and
gratification
he
may
expect
in
a
visit
from
your
Majesty
tomorrow
;
but
his
impatience
will
be
so
great
that
he
will
be
far
better
pleased
that
it
should
occur
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
”“I
<EOS>
hope
we
shall
take
him
by
surprise
,
"
say
the
king
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
desire
him
to
make
any
preparation
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
receive
by
him
,
not
as
the
king
,
but
as
plain
William
Jackson
.
<EOS>
besides
,
if
by
any
accident
the
expect
visit
of
to
-
morrow
should
have
reach
the
enemy
,
and
bring
them
to
the
house
,
they
will
be
a
day
too
late
.
”“True
,
"
reply
Clavering
,
thoughtfully
.
<EOS>
"
all
thing
consider
,
I
be
not
sorry
that
your
Majesty
have
advance
the
hour
of
your
departure
.
<EOS>
”At
<EOS>
this
juncture
<EOS>
an
opening
in
the
tree
display
a
fine
view
of
the
country
,
the
prospect
be
terminate
by
Portsmouth
,
with
its
shipping
,
and
the
Isle
of
Wight
.
<EOS>
the
king
stop
to
gaze
at
the
scene
,
and
his
little
escort
halt
likewise
.
<EOS>
after
look
for
a
few
moment
at
the
distant
arsenal
,
with
its
fort
,
dock
,
and
storehouse
,
he
exclaim
,
in
tone
of
some
emotion
,
not
unmingle
with
bitterness
.
<EOS>
“Oh
,
that
yon
noble
arsenal
,
with
its
fortification
and
store
,
and
the
powerful
fleet
in
its
harbour
,
be
mine
!
<EOS>
I
should
not
need
more
to
regain
my
kingdom
.
<EOS>
but
all
have
fall
from
me
except
you
,
my
faithful
follower
,
and
a
few
other
,
and
I
ought
,
therefore
,
to
estimate
your
loyalty
at
its
true
value
.
<EOS>
”after
<EOS>
a
brief
pause
he
continue
,
in
a
voice
of
deep
emotion
,
"
now
that
the
hour
be
almost
come
when
I
must
exile
myself
from
my
country
,
and
seek
shelter
on
a
foreign
shore
<EOS>
,
I
shrink
from
the
effort
,
and
almost
prefer
death
to
a
flight
,
which
have
something
cowardly
and
dishonourable
about
it
—
unworthy
of
the
descendant
of
a
royal
line
,
and
himself
a
king
.
<EOS>
”“View
<EOS>
not
your
withdrawal
in
that
light
,
my
gracious
liege
,
"
say
Clavering
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
unworthy
in
your
meditate
flight
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
it
be
a
course
of
action
dictate
by
prudence
.
<EOS>
if
a
chance
remain
of
regain
your
kingdom
,
I
and
your
faithful
liegeman
would
urge
you
to
stay
.
<EOS>
but
the
moment
be
unpropitious
,
and
you
do
wisely
to
withdraw
till
this
terrible
temp
now
pass
over
the
land
shall
have
exhaust
its
fury
.
<EOS>
leave
your
misguided
and
ungrateful
subject
for
a
while
to
the
care
of
the
usurper
Cromwell
—
they
will
soon
be
heartily
sick
of
him

eager
to

<EOS>
”“what
<EOS>
you
say

true

perfectly
true

reply
Charles

I
must
go

sad
intelligence
<EOS>
you
yourself

the
semblance

if
I
quit

England

us
on!”with

put
his

off

<EOS>
mount

similar

<EOS>
in
one
of

have
be
construct

<EOS>
on
a

in

of
the
lowly
habitation
sit
a
venerable
figure
,
which
irresistibly
attract
the
king
’s
attention
,
and
arrest
his
progress
.
<EOS>
the
personage
seem
to
be
of
an
age
almost
patriarchal
,
to
judge
from
his
hoary
lock
and
long
silvery
beard
.
<EOS>
originally
,
he
must
have
be
of
lofty
stature
,
but
his
frame
be
bent
by
the
weight
of
year

and
his
limb
shrink

<EOS>
His
head
be
uncover

plough
deeply

His
garb
be
that
of
a
common
shepherd
of

<EOS>
at
his
foot
lie
a
dog
,
whose
appearance
be
almost
as
antiquated
as
that
of
his
master

<EOS>
on
the
bench
near
this
patriarch
of
the
hill
sit
a
little
girl
,
who
be
read
the
Bible
to

<EOS>
perceive
from
the

look
that
he
desire
to
know
something

this
venerable
personage
,
Colonel
Gunter
inform
his
Majesty

<EOS>
He
be
what
in

for
some
time

he
have
inhabit
that
hollow

have
scoop
out
a
cave
in
the

with
which
the
hut
communicate

<EOS>
these
particular
,
combine
with
the
old

patriarchal
appearance
,
interested
Charles
so
much
that
he
alight
,
and
commit
his
horse
to
Clavering

advance
alone
towards
the
cavity

advantage

close

the
former
in
a
plain
suit
of
black
,
and
the
latter
attire
with
great
neatness
and
simplicity
,
but
without
any
pretension
to
show
or
elegance
.
<EOS>
such
,
however
,
be
the
effect
of
her
charm
of
person
and
manner
,
and
so
little
<EOS>
do
she
require
the
aid
of
dress
and
ornament
,
that
Charles
,
when
he
behold
her
,
be
quite
electrify
by
her
surpass
beauty
,
and
think
he
have
never
see
court
dame
so
lovely
as
this
country
damsel

sole
decoration
be
a

flower

all
the
retainer

muster
for

all

in
gala
attire

none

it
may
be
proper
to
state

have
any
positive
knowledge
of
the
exalted
rank
of
the
guest
whom
their
master
be
about
to
welcome
,
though
most
of
them
suspect
the
truth
.
<EOS>
but
though
,
as
we
be
aware
,
the
whole
of
the
colonel
’s
household
be
staunch
Royalists
,
and
may
have
be
entrust
with
the
secret
without
fear
of
the
consequence

only
one
amongst

absolutely
confide
in
be
old
Martin
Geere

<EOS>
greatly
elated

anxious
to
maintain
his

importance

the
old

man
now
assume
a
consequential
manner
and
dignified
deportment
quite
unlike
his
ordinary
bearing

<EOS>
He
be
provide
with
a
wand
to
marshal
the
household
,
and
enable
him
to
act
as
sort
of
usher
in
the
approach
ceremony

<EOS>
at
the
precise
moment
when
the
old
Cavalier
appear
at
the
doorway

attend
as
we
have
describe

Charles
enter

so
that

may
be

<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
disguise
adopt
by
the
royal
wanderer
,
and
the
change
effect
in
his
general
appearance
,
Colonel
Maunsel
instantly
recognise
him
,
and
,
take
off
his
hat
,
advance
slowly
and
with
great
dignity
,
but
with
the
most
profound
respect
,
to
meet
him
and
give
him
welcome
.
<EOS>
if
Charles
have
come
there
in
the
plenitude
of
his
power
,
in
gorgeous
apparel
,
and
attend
by
a
brilliant
bevy
of
courtier
,
instead
of
as
a
proscribed
fugitive
,
and
scantily
attend
,
Colonel
Maunsel
could
not
have
show
him
great
reverence
.
<EOS>
It
be
with
great
difficulty
that
he
prevent
himself
from
bend
the
knee
to
the

only

indeed

a

from

it

more

no

this

the

emphatically—“no

pardon
me

I
say

your

be
equal

I
thank
you
for
the
assurance

<EOS>
but
a
truce
to
claim
real

imaginary
!
<EOS>
allow
me
to
see
the
interior
of
your
mansion
,
which
,
if
it
correspond
with
the
outside

must
be
well
worth
inspection

”“‘tis

the

;
"
and
if
I
be
able
to
keep
it
up
<EOS>
I
shall
be
quite
content

<EOS>

the
fine
and
confiscation
of

have
wellnigh
ruin
me

”“ay

His

Clavering
tap
at
the

door
,
and
receive
no
answer
,
though
he
repeat
the
application
yet
more
loudly
,
venture
to
enter
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
pause
for
a
moment
in
the
outer
chamber
,
and
cough
slightly
to
announce
his
presence
,
he
go
on
,
and
be
both
surprised
and
alarm
not
to
perceive
the
king
.
<EOS>
remarking
,
however
,
that
his
Majesty
have
change
his
attire
,
and
that
the
small
door
communicate
with
the
back
staircase
be
leave
partly
open
,
he
conclude
Charles
must
have
discover
that
mean
of
exit
,
and
have
probably
find
his
way
to
the
garden
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
conviction
,
however
,
he
could
not
shake
off
a
strong
feeling
of
uneasiness
,
and
resolve
to
satisfy
himself
without
delay
,
quickly
descend
the
winding
staircase
and
reach
the
postern
at
its
foot
,
which
he
find
unlocked
.
<EOS>
the
latter
circumstance
convince
him
that
he
be
right
in
his
conjecture
,
and
he
now
feel
certain
of
find
his
Majesty
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
but
though
he
visit
every
walk
,
alley
,
and
labyrinth
,
he
be
unsuccessful
,
and
all
his
alarm
return
,
and
with
additional
force
.
<EOS>
one
hope
alone
sustain
him
.
<EOS>
the
king
—
though
this
appear
highly
improbable
—
may
have
stray
into
the
orchard
,
or
the
holt
beyond
it
.
<EOS>
to
the
orchard
he
fly
at
once
,
and
have
scarcely
open
the
gate
lead
to
it
when
he
encounter
old
Ticehurst
,
the
gardener
,
and
Nut
Springett
.
<EOS>
in
answer
to
his
inquiry
,
ticehurst
state
that
about
five

from

postern
,
and
pass
out
at
the
gate
in
the
north
wall
near
Morefruit
Stone
’s
cottage
.
<EOS>
still
more
perplexed
,
but
think
this
must
be
the
king
,
though
he
be
wholly
unable
to
account
for
such
imprudence
on
his
Majesty
’s
part
,
Clavering
hurry
off
in
the
direction
take
by
the
person
whom
the
gardener
have
see
,
and
pass
through
the
gate

to

great
be

on
enter
it

to
find
Increase

John
Habergeon

<EOS>
the
only
person
in

,
besides
the
Independent
minister
and
his
captor
,
be
Morefruit
Stone
’s
daughter
,
Temperance
,
a
comely
damsel
,
to
whom
Ninian
have
once
pay
considerable
attention
.
<EOS>
instantly
divine
that
treachery
have
be
practise
by
Micklegift
,
Clavering
draw
his
sword
,
and
place
its
point
at
the
other
’s
throat
,
demand
,
in
a
terrible
voice,“what
hast
thou
do
with
him
?
<EOS>
where
be
he?”“Harm
me
,
and
thou
shalt
never
learn
,
"
reply
the
Independent
minister
,
composedly
.
<EOS>
“let
<EOS>
us

there

say
John

<EOS>
"
He

<EOS>
I

we
will
find
mean
of
make
him
speak

<EOS>
”“try

<EOS>
rejoin
Micklegift

with
a

<EOS>
“Ay

<EOS>
"
We
will
question
thee
with
the
thumbscrew

after
Captain
Stelfax

fashion

<EOS>
”“How
come
you
to
find

<EOS>
inquire
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“We

Ninian
,
with
a
grateful
look
at
the

in

;
"
<EOS>
and
I
shall
not
soon
forget
the
service
she
have
do

<EOS>
”“Woe

<EOS>
for
she
hath
betray
her

Micklegift

sternly
.
<EOS>
"
Her
love
for
this
vain
youth
shall
never
prosper

<EOS>
”“That
be
more
than
you
can
answer
for

"
reply
Ninian
.
<EOS>
“Where
be
her

"
<EOS>
demand
Clavering
.
<EOS>
“He
<EOS>
hath
escape
from
the
hand
of
these
Philistines

"
say
Micklegift
,
with
a
look
of
triumph
,
"
and
will
yet
bring
the
enemy
upon
you
.
<EOS>
”“be
<EOS>
not

,
sir
,
"
reply
John
Habergeon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
hath
start
for
Lewes
,
but
he
can
not
have
go
far
.
<EOS>
Eustace
Saxby
be
upon
his
track
.
<EOS>
besides
,
there
be
other
on
the
look

out
,
whose
vigilance
he
will
find
it
difficult
to
elude
.
<EOS>
”“I
have
not
tell
all
I
know
,
"
say
Temperance
;
"
but
since
I
be
provoke
,
I
will
withhold
nothing

"
<EOS>
and
she
then
proceed
to
relate
to
Clavering
that
Micklegift
and
Stelfax
be
conceal
in
her
father
’s
cottage
as
he
have
pass
on

one
of
the
party
have
be
recognize
by
the
two
man
,
who
declare
it
be
the
Young

<EOS>
that
Stelfax
then
declare
that
at
all
hazard
he
would
obtain
admission
to
the
house
and
accomplish
his
arrest
,
and
Micklegift
agree
to
accompany
him
,
tell
him
he
know
a
way
by
which
they
could
obtain
secret
admission
to
the
colonel

<EOS>
“The

art
<EOS>
sure

that
room

"
demand
John
Habergeon

<EOS>
"
if
so
,
they
must
have
gain
admission
by
the
postern
opening
from
the
back

into
the
garden

<EOS>
”“they
<EOS>
do

how
come

for
he
unlock
the
garden

,
and
they
go
in
together
.
<EOS>
feel
sure
some
great
mischief
be
afoot
,
I
make
an
excuse
to
quit
the
cottage
,
and
hasten
in
search
of
Ninian
,
whom
I
find
with
his
father

tell
him
what
have

pounce
upon

here
we
have
him
safe
enough

you
see

”“But

His

then

it
be
scarcely
probable
that
this

of

he
himself
have

Clavering

would
remain

<EOS>
this
show

gaiety

in
the
Nineteenth

centurylittle
do
Charles
the

foresee
,
when
halt
on
the
evening
in
question
with
his
escort
on
the
smooth
and
pleasant
slope
of
the
hill
now
lay
out
as
the
Queen
’s
Park
,
that
on
the
site
of
the
obscure
fishing
-
village
towards
which
he
gaze
,
would
arise
,
some
two
century
later
,
one
of
the
fair
and
most
magnificent
city
ever
build
on
the
margin
of
the
sea
,
since
the
time
when
Pompeii
the
Beautiful
be
destroy
by
the
fiery
ashe
of
Vesuvius
.
<EOS>
little
do
he
think
that
the
bare
and
solitary
cliff
above
which
he
stand
would
be
cover
with
line
of
stately
terrace
,
comprise
mansion
many
of
which
would
rival
in
size
and
splendour
the
most
princely
habitation
of
the
London
of
his
own
day
.
<EOS>
little
do
he
think
that
in
that
wide
hollow
,
now
know
as
the
Steyne
,
through
the
midst
of
which
an
open
brook
find
its
way
to
the
sea
,
where
stunt
tree
distort
by
the
gale
,
and
mean
scattered
habitation
surround
by
patch
of
ill
-
keep
garden
,
and
tenant
by
fisherman
and
other
seafare
folk
,
could
alone
be
distinguished
—
little
do
he
think
that
in
this
dreary
hollow
one
of
the
most
refined
of
his
successor
,
and
one
whose
sybaritic
taste
be
in
many
respect
akin
to
his
own
,
would
construct
a
palace
of
oriental
splendour
.
<EOS>
little
do
he
foresee
that
,
in
the
lapse
of
time
,
this
remote
and
almost
unknown
fishing
village
on
the
Sussex
coast
should
become
,
by
agency
of
which
he
could
not
dream
,
and
which
,
if
describe
,
he
may
not
have
credit
,
so
connected
with
the
great
metropolis
itself
,
as
to
form
almost
its
marine
suburb
.
<EOS>
little
do
he
foresee
these
wondrous
and
inconceivable
change
.
<EOS>
and
if
a
vision
of
the
Brighton
of
the
Nineteenth
Century
could
have
be
reveal
to
him
,
he
may
have
think
he
have
be
suddenly
transport
to
some
other
and
more
favoured
portion
of
the
globe
.
<EOS>
what
two
century
more
may
do
for
this
superb
marine
city
<EOS>
we
be
not
bold
enough
to
speculate
.
<EOS>
but
if
the
change
should
be
as
great
as
those
which
have
occur
since
Charles
the
Second
gaze
upon
the
little
parent
village
on
the
evening
of
the
14th
of
October
,
1651
,
Brighton
will
have
become
a
marvellous
city
indeed
.
<EOS>
but
since
there
be
no
magician
in
the
young
king
’s
escort
to
raise
up
for
him
a
vision
of
the
future
splendid
city
,
nor
any
astrologer
to
foretell
its
grandeur
,
Charles
see
only
that
which
be
exhibit
to
the
ordinary
eye
of
humanity
.
<EOS>
and
the
picture
,
it
must
be
own
,
be
one
that
do
not
excite
any
extraordinary
interest
in
his
breast
;
neither
may
it
merit
any
special
description
,
except
that
there
may
be
some
person
not
indispose
to
learn
what
the
Queen
of
English
watering

immediately
below

almost
on

these

with
a

most
old
Sussex

as
,
for
example
,
Chichester
and
Lewes
—
Brightelmstone
be
so
closely
and
compactly
build
that
it
may
be
describe
as
a
great
block
of
house
,
intersect
by
alley
or
lane
so
extremely
narrow
as
scarcely
to
allow
two
person
meet
in
them
to
pass
each
other
,
and
know
in
the
dialect
of
the
place
as
"
twitten

<EOS>
but
perhaps
the
most
curious
feature
of
the
old
town
,
all
trace
of
which
have
long
since
be
sweep
away
by
the
encroachment
of
the
sea
,
be
then
to
be
find
below
the
cliff
.
<EOS>
here
be
build
a
long
street
of
little
tenement
,
stretch
from
the
Steyne
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
along
the
shore
in
the
direction
of
Hove
.
<EOS>
these
tenement
be
exclusively
inhabit
by
fisherman
and

,
a
bold
and
hardy
,
though
somewhat
troublesome
,
race
,
who
claim
to
themselves
certain
privilege
and
immunity
,
and
be
uncommonly
tenacious
,
and
,
indeed
,
pugnacious
,
in
the
maintenance
of
their

<EOS>
the
Brightelmstone
fisherman
form
a
distinct
class
from
the
rest
of
the
townsfolk
,
and
be
constantly
at

with
the
latter

<EOS>
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
,
and

above
these
humble
dwelling
,
which
it

to
crush
by
its
fall
(
and
such
an
accident
do
eventually
occur
)
,
stand
,
at
the
date
of
our
story
,
an
ancient
castle
,
or
block
-
house
of
stone
,
construct
by
Henry
VIII
about
the
year
1539
,
for
the
defence
of
the
coast
.
<EOS>
the
town
of
Brightelmstone
,
as
we
have
state
,
be
chiefly
concentrated
on
the
side
of
the
hill
,
and
do
not
extend
beyond
West
Street
,
whither
we
shall
presently
repair
.
<EOS>
from
this
point
to
the
neighbouring
village
of
Hove
there
only
intervene
a
few
cottage
and
a
single
farm
-
house
,
and
these
at
wide
interval
.
<EOS>
note
much
that
we
have
describe
—
namely
,
the
old
church
,
the
cluster
of
house
on
the
hill
-
side
,
and
the
block
-
house
—
Charles
suffer
his
gaze
to
stray
towards
Shoreham
,
where
he
could
just
descry
the
mast
of
the
vessel
within
the
harbour
,
and
wonder
whether
any
that
he
see
belong
to
the
Swiftsure
.
<EOS>
satisfied
with
his
survey
,
Charles
put
his
horse
in
motion
,
and
the
whole
party
ride
on
,
take
their
way
down
the
declivity
,
which
be

by
a
dense
mass

the

and
presently
after
ominous
sound
be

without

announce
that
sentinel
be

post
at
the
door
of
the
hostel
with
order
to
shoot

a
stern
voice

in
the
passage

hold
a
brief
colloquy
with
the
host

after
which
the
door

stride

<EOS>
Poor
Bonfellow
Smith
do
not
venture
further
than
the
doorway
,
where
he
stand
a
terrified
spectator
of
the
scene
,
his
naturally
rosy
countenance
have
become
as
white
as
his
own
apron
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
a
great
change
have
take
place
in
the
appearance
of
three
of
the
personage
at
the
table
.
<EOS>
Lord
Wilmot
appear
to
be
fast
asleep
,
with
his
head
upon
the
board
,
and
Charles
,
to
judge
from
his
look
,
be
completely
overcome
by
liquor
.
<EOS>
never
be
the
appearance
of
a
drunken
man
better
simulate
than
by
the
king
—
head
hang
down
—
<EOS>
eye
half
shut
,
and
stupid
in
expression
—
limb
wholly
unequal
to
their
office
,
since
their
owner
could
apparently
neither
rise
from
his
chair
nor
guide
the
pipe
to
his
lip
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Gunter
have
put
on
a
black
skull
-
cap
and
spectacle
,
and
smooth
down
his
band
.
<EOS>
by
elongate
his
feature
,
he
manage
to
give
them
a
decidedly
puritanical
expression
.
<EOS>
Delves
(
for
he
be
the
sergeant
of
ironside
in
question
)
march
towards
the
group
at
the
table
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Gunter
and
Tattersall
rise
at
his
approach
,
but
the
other
two
remain
as
we
have
describe
them
,
except
that
Charles
apparently
make
an
effort
to
get
up
,
and
fail
totally
,
<EOS>
seem
to
maintain
his
balance
in
the
chair
with
difficulty
.
<EOS>
delf
,
though
regard
him
at
first
with
suspicion
,
could
evidently
make
nothing
of
him
,
but
turn
his
attention
to
Lord
Wilmot
,
seize
him
by
the
shoulder
,
and
shake
him
lustily
.
<EOS>
thus
rouse
,
his
lordship
look
up
for
a
moment
with
the
vacant
stare
of
an
intoxicated
man
,
and
then
lay
his
head
down
again
.
<EOS>
“Who
be
these
drunken
fellow
?
"
<EOS>
demand
Delves
of
Tattersall

<EOS>
“Two

I

<EOS>
”“it

a
look

infinite
disgust

“in

another

<EOS>
“True

I
do
not

I
hope

<EOS>
”“they

this
moment
,
a
cautious
knocking
be

the

<EOS>
“admit

straight

my

<EOS>
immediately
afterwards
quick
footstep
be

remain
in
the

<EOS>
“I

”“And
delighted
I

the

<EOS>
"
but
how
do
you
manage
to
escape
from
those
rascally
ironsides?”“my

me
,
as
I
feel
sure
they
would
,
"
rejoin
Gunter
,
point
to
Clavering
and
the
other
;
"
but
they
have
hard
work
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
”“so
<EOS>
it
would
seem
,
"
reply
Charles
,
notice
that
the
young
man
and
those
near
him
bear
mark
of
a
recent
and
severe
conflict
.
<EOS>
"
tell
me
how
it
chanced?”“Your
Majesty
have
some
enemy
the
less

Clavering
.
<EOS>
"
but
you
have
lose
one
faithful
subject

"
he
add
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
“How
?
"
exclaim
Charles
,
glance
at
the
group
in
the
background

<EOS>
"
I
discover
not
stout
John

<EOS>
be
he
gone?”“Ay

He
die
like
a
brave
and
loyal
man

sword
in

,
smite
the
enemy
of
his

<EOS>
thus
it
fall
out
:
I
and
those
with
me
be
aware
of
the
visit
of
the
iron
-
side
to
this
inn
,
for
we
be
scout
about
the
town
;
but
we
do
not
think
it
