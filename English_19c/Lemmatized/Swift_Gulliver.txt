<EOS>
the
author
of
these
Travels
,
Mr.
Lemuel
Gulliver
,
be
my
ancient
and
intimate
friend
;
there
be
likewise
some
relation
between
us
on
the
mother
's
side
.
 
<EOS>
about
three
year
ago
,
Mr.
Gulliver
grow
weary
of
the
concourse
of
curious
people
come
to
him
at
his
house
in
Redriff
,
make
a
small
purchase
of
land
,
with
a
convenient
house
,
near
Newark
,
in
Nottinghamshire
,
his
native
country
;
where
he
now
live
retired
,
yet
in
good
esteem
among
his
neighbour
.
  
<EOS>
although
Mr.
Gulliver
be
bear
in
Nottinghamshire
,
where
his
father
dwelt
,
yet
I
have
hear
him
say
his
family
come
from
Oxfordshire
;
to
confirm
which
,
I
have
observe
in
the
churchyard
at
Banbury
in
that
county
,
several
tomb
and
monument
of
the
Gullivers
.
  
<EOS>
before
he
quit
Redriff
,
he
leave
the
custody
of
the
follow
paper
in
my
hand
,
with
the
liberty
to
dispose
of
them
as
I
should
think
fit
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
carefully
peruse
them
three
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
style
be
very
plain
and
simple
;
and
the
only
fault
I
find
be
,
that
the
author
,
after
the
manner
of
traveller
,
be
a
little
too
circumstantial
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
air
of
truth
apparent
through
the
whole
;
and
indeed
the
author
be
so
distinguished
for
his
veracity
,
that
it
become
a
sort
of
proverb
among
his
neighbour
at
Redriff
,
when
any
one
affirm
a
thing
,
to
say
,
it
be
as
true
as
if
Mr.
Gulliver
have
speak
it
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
advice
of
several
worthy
person
,
to
whom
,
with
the
author
's
permission
,
I
communicate
these
paper
,
I
now
venture
to
send
them
into
the
world
,
hope
they
may
be
,
at
least
for
some
time
,
a
well
entertainment
to
our
young
nobleman
,
than
the
common
scribble
of
politic
and
party
.
  
<EOS>
this
volume
would
have
be
at
least
twice
as
large
,
if
I
have
not
make
bold
to
strike
out
innumerable
passage
relate
to
the
wind
and
tide
,
as
well
as
to
the
variation
and
bearing
in
the
several
voyage
,
together
with
the
minute
description
of
the
management
of
the
ship
in
storm
,
in
the
style
of
sailor
;
likewise
the
account
of
longitude
and
latitude
;
wherein
I
have
reason
to
apprehend
,
that
Mr.
Gulliver
may
be
a
little
dissatisfied
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
resolve
to
fit
the
work
as
much
as
possible
to
the
general
capacity
of
reader
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
if
my
own
ignorance
in
sea
affair
shall
have
lead
me
to
commit
some
mistake
,
I
alone
be
answerable
for
them
.
<EOS>
and
if
any
traveller
hath
a
curiosity
to
see
the
whole
work
at
large
,
as
it
come
from
the
hand
of
the
author
,
I
will
be
ready
to
gratify
him
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
any
further
particular
relate
to
the
author
,
the
reader
will
receive
satisfaction
from
the
first
page
of
the
book

<EOS>
a
letter
from
captain
GULLIVER
to
his
COUSIN
SYMPSON
.
 
<EOS>
WRITTEN
in
the
year
1727
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
be
ready
to
own
publicly
,
whenever
you
shall
be
call
to
it
,
that
by
your
great
and
frequent
urgency
you
prevail
on
me
to
publish
a
very
loose
and
uncorrect
account
of
my
travel
,
with
direction
to
hire
some
young
gentleman
of
either
university
to
put
them
in
order
,
and
correct
the
style
,
as
my
cousin
Dampier
do
,
by
my
advice
,
in
his
book
call
"
a
Voyage
<EOS>
round
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
not
remember
I
give
you
power
to
consent
that
any
thing
should
be
omit
,
and
much
less
that
any
thing
should
be
insert
;
therefore
,
as
to
the
latter
,
I
do
here
renounce
every
thing
of
that
kind
;
particularly
a
paragraph
about
her
majesty
Queen
Anne
,
of
most
pious
and
glorious
memory
;
although
I
do
reverence
and
esteem
her
more
than
any
of
human
specie
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
,
or
your
interpolator
,
ought
to
have
consider
,
that
it
be
not
my
inclination
,
<EOS>
so
be
it
not
decent
to
praise
any
animal
of
our
composition
before
my
master
Houyhnhnm
:
 
<EOS>
and
besides
,
the
fact
be
altogether
false
;
for
to
my
knowledge
,
be
in
England
during
some
part
of
her
majesty
's
reign
,
she
do
govern
by
a
chief
minister
;
nay
even
by
two
successively
,
<EOS>
the
first
whereof
be
the
lord
of
Godolphin
,
and
the
second
the
lord
of
Oxford
;
so
that
you
have
make
me
say
the
thing
that
be
not
.
 
<EOS>
likewise
in
the
account
of
the
academy
of
projector
,
and
several
passage
of
my
discourse
to
my
master
Houyhnhnm
,
you
have
either
omit
some
material
circumstance
,
or
mince
or
change
them
in
such
a
manner
,
that
I
do
hardly
know
my
own
work
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
formerly
hint
to
you
something
of
this
in
a
letter
,
you
be
pleased
to
answer
that
you
be
afraid
of
give
offence
;
that
people
in
power
be
very
watchful
over
the
press
,
and
apt
not
only
to
interpret
,
but
to
punish
every
thing
which
look
like
an
innuendo
(
as
I
think
you
call
it
)
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
pray
how
could
that
which
I
speak
so
many
year
ago
,
and
at
about
five
thousand
league
distance
,
in
another
reign
,
be
apply
to
any
of
the
Yahoos
,
who
now
be
say
to
govern
the
herd
;
especially
at
a
time
when
I
little
think
,
or
fear
,
the
unhappiness
of
live
under
them
?
 
<EOS>
have
not
I
the
most
reason
to
complain
,
when
I
see
these
very
Yahoos
carry
by
Houyhnhnms
in
a
vehicle
,
as
if
they
be
brute
,
and
those
the
rational
creature
?
 
<EOS>
and
indeed
to
avoid
so
monstrous
and
detestable
a
sight
be
one
principal
motive
of
my
retirement
hither
.
  
<EOS>
thus
much
I
think
proper
to
tell
you
in
relation
to
yourself
,
and
to
the
trust
I
repose
in
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
,
in
the
next
place
,
complain
of
my
own
great
want
of
judgment
,
in
be
prevail
upon
by
the
entreaty
and
false
reasoning
of
you
and
some
other
,
very
much
against
my
own
opinion
,
to
suffer
my
travel
to
be
publish
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
bring
to
your
mind
<EOS>
how
often
I
desire
you
to
consider
,
<EOS>
when
you
insist
on
the
motive
of
public
good
,
that
the
Yahoos
be
a
species
of
animal
utterly
incapable
of
amendment
by
precept
or
example
:
 
and
so
it
have
prove
;
for
,
instead
of
see
a
full
stop
put
to
all
abuse
and
corruption
,
at
least
in
this
little
island
,
as
I
have
reason
to
expect
;
behold
,
after
above
six
month
warn
,
I
can
not
learn
that
my
book
have
produce
one
single
effect
accord
to
my
intention
.
 
<EOS>
I
desire
<EOS>
you
would
let
me
know
,
by
a
letter
,
when
party
and
faction
be
extinguish
;
judge
learn
and
upright
;
pleader
honest
and
modest
,
with
some
tincture
of
common
sense
,
and
Smithfield
blaze
with
pyramid
of
law
book
;
the
young
nobility
's
education
entirely
change
;
the
physician
banish
;
the
female
Yahoos
abound
in
virtue
,
honour
,
truth
,
and
good
sense
;
court
and
levee
of
great
minister
thoroughly
weed
and
sweep
;
wit
,
merit
,
and
learn
reward
;
all
disgracer
of
the
press
in
prose
and
verse
condemn
to
eat
nothing
but
their
own
cotton
,
and
quench
their
thirst
with
their
own
ink
.
 
<EOS>
these
,
and
a
thousand
other
reformation
<EOS>
,
I
firmly
count
upon
by
your
encouragement
;
as
indeed
they
be
plainly
deducible
from
the
precept
deliver
in
my
book
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
must
be
own
<EOS>
,
that
seven
month
be
a
sufficient
time
to
correct
every
vice
and
folly
to
which
Yahoos
be
subject
,
if
their
nature
have
be
capable
of
the
least
disposition
to
virtue
or
wisdom
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
so
far
have
you
be
from
answer
my
expectation
in
any
of
your
letter
;
that
on
the
contrary
you
be
load
our
carrier
every
week
with
libel
,
and
key
,
and
reflection
,
and
memoir
,
and
second
part
;
wherein
I
see
myself
accuse
of
reflect
upon
great
state
folk
;
of
degrade
human
nature
(
for
so
they
have
still
the
confidence
to
style
it
)
,
and
of
abuse
the
female
sex
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
likewise
that
the
writer
of
those
bundle
be
not
agree
among
themselves
;
for
some
of
them
will
not
allow
me
to
be
the
author
of
my
own
travel
;
and
other
make
me
author
of
book
to
which
I
be
wholly
a
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
likewise
that
your
printer
have
be
so
careless
as
to
confound
the
time
,
and
mistake
the
date
,
of
my
several
voyage
and
return
;
neither
assign
the
true
year
,
nor
the
true
month
,
nor
day
of
the
month
:
 
and
I
hear
the
original
manuscript
be
all
destroy
since
the
publication
of
my
book
;
neither
have
I
any
copy
leave
:
 
however
,
I
have
send
you
some
correction
,
which
you
may
insert
,
if
ever
there
should
be
a
second
edition
:
 
and
yet
I
can
not
stand
to
them
;
but
shall
leave
that
matter
to
my
judicious
and
candid
reader
to
adjust
it
as
they
please
.
  
<EOS>
I
hear
some
of
our
sea
Yahoos
find
fault
with
my
sea
-
language
,
as
not
proper
in
many
part
,
nor
now
in
use
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
in
my
first
voyage
,
while
I
be
young
,
I
be
instruct
by
the
old
mariner
,
and
learn
to
speak
as
they
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
since
find
that
the
sea
Yahoos
be
apt
,
like
the
land
one
,
to
become
new
-
fangle
in
their
word
,
which
the
latter
change
every
year
;
insomuch
,
as
I
remember
upon
each
return
to
my
own
country
their
old
dialect
be
so
alter
,
that
I
could
hardly
understand
the
new
.
<EOS>
and
I
observe
,
when
any
Yahoo
come
from
London
out
of
curiosity
to
visit
me
at
my
house
,
we
neither
of
us
be
able
to
deliver
our
conception
in
a
manner
intelligible
to
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
censure
of
the
Yahoos
could
any
way
affect
me
,
I
should
have
great
reason
to
complain
,
that
some
of
them
be
so
bold
as
to
think
my
book
of
travel
a
mere
fiction
out
of
mine
own
brain
,
and
have
go
so
far
as
to
drop
hint
,
that
the
Houyhnhnms
and
Yahoos
have
no
more
existence
than
the
inhabitant
of
Utopia
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
I
must
confess
,
that
as
to
the
people
of
Lilliput
,
Brobdingrag
(
for
so
the
word
should
have
be
spelt
,
and
not
erroneously
Brobdingnag
)
,
and
Laputa
,
I
have
never
yet
hear
of
any
Yahoo
so
presumptuous
as
to
dispute
their
being
,
or
the
fact
I
have
relate
concern
them
;
because
the
truth
immediately
strike
every
reader
with
conviction
.
 
<EOS>
and
be
there
less
probability
in
my
account
of
the
Houyhnhnms
or
Yahoos
,
<EOS>
when
it
be
manifest
as
to
the
latter
,
there
be
so
many
thousand
even
in
this
country
,
who
only
differ
from
their
brother
brute
in
Houyhnhnmland
,
because
they
use
a
sort
of
jabber
,
and
do
not
go
naked
?
 
<EOS>
I
write
for
their
amendment
,
and
not
their
approbation
.
 
<EOS>
the
united
praise
of
the
whole
race
would
be
of
less
consequence
to
me
,
than
the
neighing
of
those
two
degenerate
Houyhnhnms
<EOS>
I
keep
in
my
stable
;
because
from
these
,
degenerate
as
they
be
,
I
still
improve
in
some
virtue
without
any
mixture
of
vice
.
  
<EOS>
do
these
miserable
animal
presume
to
think
,
that
I
be
so
degenerated
as
to
defend
my
veracity
?
 
<EOS>
Yahoo
as
I
be
,
it
be
well
known
through
all
Houyhnhnmland
,
that
,
by
the
instruction
and
example
of
my
illustrious
master
,
I
be
able
in
the
compass
of
two
year
<EOS>
(
although
I
confess
with
the
utmost
difficulty
)
to
remove
that
infernal
habit
of
lying
,
shuffling
,
deceive
,
and
equivocate
,
so
deeply
rooted
in
the
very
soul
of
all
my
specie
;
especially
the
Europeans
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
other
complaint
to
make
upon
this
vexatious
occasion
;
but
I
forbear
troubling
myself
or
you
any
further
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
freely
confess
,
that
since
my
last
return
,
some
corruption
of
my
Yahoo
nature
have
revive
in
me
by
converse
with
a
few
of
your
specie
,
and
particularly
those
of
my
own
family
,
by
an
unavoidable
necessity
;
else
I
should
never
have
attempt
so
absurd
a
project
as
that
of
reform
the
Yahoo
race
in
this
kingdom
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
now
do
with
all
such
visionary
scheme
for
ever
.

My

in
Cambridge
at
fourteen
year
old

where
I
reside
three
year

apply
myself
close
to
my
study
;
but
the
charge
of
maintain
me
,
although
I
have
a
very
scanty
allowance
,
be
too
great
for
a
narrow
fortune
,
I
be
bind
apprentice
to
Mr.
James

,
an
eminent
surgeon
in
London
,
with
whom
I
continue
four
year

other

useful
to
those
who
intend
to
travel
,
as
I
always
believe
it
would
be

some
time
or
other

my
fortune
to
do

<EOS>
when
I
leave
Mr.
Bates

I
go
down
to
my

<EOS>
where
,
by
the
assistance

other
relation
,
I
get
forty
pound

a

to
maintain
me
at
Leyden

there
I
study
physic
two
year

seven

know
it

I

by
my
good
master
,
Mr.
Bates
,
to
be
surgeon
to
the
Swallow
,
Captain
Abraham
Pannel
,
commander
;
with
whom
I
continue
three
year
and
a
half
,
make
a
voyage
or
two
into
the
Levant
,
and
some
other
part
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
come
back
I
resolve
to
settle
in
London
;
to
which
Mr.
Bates
,
my
master
,
encourage
me
,
and
by
him
I
be
recommend
to
several
patient
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
part
of
a
small
house
in
the
Old
Jewry
;
and
be
advise
to
alter
my
condition
,
I
marry
Mrs.
Mary
Burton
,
second
daughter
to
Mr.
Edmund
Burton
,
hosier
,
in
Newgate
-
street
,
with
whom
I
receive
four
hundred
pound
for
a
portion
.
  
<EOS>
but
my
good
master
Bates
die
in
two
year
after
,
and
<EOS>
I
have
few
friend
,
my
business
begin
to
fail
;
for
my
conscience
would
not
suffer
me
to
imitate
the
bad
practice
of
too
many
among
my
brother
.
 
<EOS>
have
therefore
consult
with
my
wife
,
and
some
of
my
acquaintance
,
I
determine
to
go
again
to
sea
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
surgeon
successively
in
two
ship
,
and
make
several
voyage
,
for
six
year
,
to
the
East
and
West
Indies
,
by
which
I
get
some
addition
to
my
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
My
hour
of
leisure
<EOS>
I
spend
in
read
the
good
author
,
ancient
and
modern
,
<EOS>
be
always
provide
with
a
good
number
of
book
;
and
when
I
be
ashore
,
in
observe
the
manner
and
disposition
of
the
people
,
as
well
as
learn
their
language
;
wherein
I
have
a
great
facility
,
by
the
strength
of
my
memory
.
  
<EOS>
the
last
of
these
voyage
not
prove
very
fortunate
,
I
grow
weary
of
the
sea
,
and
intend
to
stay
at
home
with
my
wife
and
family
.
<EOS>
I
remove
from
the
Old
Jewry
to
Fetter
Lane
,
and
from
thence
to
wapping
,
hope
to
get
business
among
the
sailor
;
but
it
would
not
turn
to
account
.
 
<EOS>
after
three
year
expectation
that
thing
would
mend
,
I
accept
an
advantageous
offer
from
Captain
William
Prichard
,
master
of
the
Antelope
,
who
be
make
a
voyage
to
the
South
Sea
.
 
<EOS>
We
set
sail
from
Bristol
,
May
4
,
1699
,
and
our
voyage
be
at
first
very
prosperous
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
proper
,
for
some
reason
,
to
trouble
the
reader
with
the
particular
of
our
adventure
in
those
sea
;
let
it
suffice
to
inform
him
,
that
in
our
passage
from
thence
to
the
East
Indies
,
we
be
drive
by
a
violent
storm
to
the
north
-
west
of
Van
Diemen
's
land
.
 
<EOS>
by
an
observation
,
we
find
ourselves
in
the
latitude
of
30
degree
2
minute
south
.
 
<EOS>
twelve
of
our
crew
be
dead
by
immoderate
labour
and
ill
food
;
the
rest
be
in
a
very
weak
condition
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
5th
of
November
,
which
be
the
beginning
of
summer
in
those
part
,
the
weather
be
very
hazy
,
the
seaman
spy
a
rock
within
half
a
cable
's
length
of
the
ship
;
but
the
wind
be
so
strong
,
that
we
be
drive
directly
upon
it
,
and
immediately
split
.
 
<EOS>
six
of
the
crew
,
of
whom
I
be
one
,
have
let
down
the
boat
into
the
sea
,
make
a
shift
to
get
clear
of
the
ship
and
the
rock
.
 
<EOS>
We
row
,
by
my
computation
,
about
three
league
,
till
we
be
able
to
work
no
longer
,
<EOS>
be
already
spend
with
labour
while
we
be
in
the
ship
.
 
<EOS>
We
therefore
trust
ourselves
to
the
mercy
of
the
wave
,
and
in
about
half
an
hour
the
boat
be
overset
by
a
sudden
flurry
from
the
north
.
 
<EOS>
what
become
of
my
companion
in
the
boat
,
as
well
as
of
those
who
escape
on
the
rock
,
or
be
leave
in
the
vessel
,
I
can
not
tell
;
but
conclude
they
be
all
lose
.
 
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
swam
as
fortune
direct
me
,
and
be
push
forward
by
wind
and
tide
.
 
<EOS>
I
often
let
my
leg
drop
,
and
could
feel
no
bottom
;
but
when
I
be
almost
go
,
and
able
to
struggle
no
longer
,
I
find
myself
within
my
depth
;
and
by
this
time
the
storm
be
much
abate
.
 
<EOS>
the
declivity
be
so
small
,
that
I
walk
near
a
mile
before
I
get
to
the
shore
,
which
I
conjecture
be
about
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
advance
forward
near
half
a
mile
,
but
could
not
discover
any
sign
of
house
or
inhabitant
;
at
least
I
be
in
so
weak
a
condition
,
that
I
do
not
observe
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
extremely
tired
,
and
with
that
,
and
the
heat
of
the
weather
,
and
about
half
a
pint
of
brandy
that
I
drink
as
I
leave
the
ship
,
I
find
myself
much
inclined
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
I
lie
down
on
the
grass
,
which
be
very
short
and
soft
,
where
I
sleep
sounder
than
ever
<EOS>
I
remember
to
have
do
in
my
life
,
and
,
as
I
reckon
,
about
nine
hour
;
for
when
I
awake
,
it
be
just
day
-
light
.
 
<EOS>
I
attempt
to
rise
,
but
be
not
able
to
stir
:
 
for
,
as
I
happen
to
lie
on
my
back
<EOS>
,
I
find
my
arm
and
leg
be
strongly
fasten
on
each
side
to
the
ground
;
and
my
hair
,
which
be
long
and
thick
,
tie
down
in
the
same
manner
.
 
<EOS>
I
likewise
feel
several
slend
ligature
across
my
body
,
from
my
arm
-
pit
to
my
thigh
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
only
look
upwards
;
the
sun
begin
to
grow
hot
,
and
the
light
offend
my
eye
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
a
confused
noise
about
me
;
but
in
the
posture
I
lay
,
could
see
nothing
except
the
sky
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
little
time
I
feel
something
alive
move
on
my
left
leg
,
which
advance
gently
forward
over
my
breast
,
come
almost
up
to
my
chin
;
when
,
bend
my
eye
downwards
as
much
as
I
could
,
I
perceive
it
to
be
a
human
creature
not
six
inch
high
,
with
a
bow
and
arrow
in
his
hand
,
and
a
quiver
at
his
back
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
I
feel
at
least
forty
more
of
the
same
kind
(
as
I
conjecture
)
follow
the
first
.
<EOS>
I
be
in
the
utmost
astonishment
,
and
roar
so
loud
,
that
they
all
run
back
in
a
fright
;
and
some
of
them
,
as
I
be
afterwards
tell
,
be
hurt
with
the
fall
they
get
by
leap
from
my
side
upon
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
they
soon
return
,
and
one
of
them
,
who
venture
so
far
as
to
get
a
full
sight
of
my
face
,
lift
up
his
hand
and
eye
by
way
of
admiration
,
cry
out
in
a
shrill
but
distinct
voice
,
Hekinah
degul
:
 
<EOS>
the
other
repeat
the
same
word
several
time
,
but
then
I
know
not
what
they
mean
.
 
<EOS>
I
lie
all
this
while
,
as
the
reader
may
believe
,
in
great
uneasiness
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
struggle
to
get
loose
,
I
have
the
fortune
to
break
the
string
,
and
wrench
out
the
peg
that
fasten
my
left
arm
to
the
ground
;
for
,
by
lift
it
up
to
my
face
<EOS>
,
I
discover
the
method
they
have
take
to
bind
me
,
and
at
the
same
time
with
a
violent
pull
,
which
give
me
excessive
pain
,
I
a
little
loosen
the
string
that
tie
down
my
hair
on
the
left
side
,
so
that
I
be
just
able
to
turn
my
head
about
two
inch
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
creature
run
off
a
second
time
,
before
I
could
seize
them
;
whereupon
there
be
a
great
shout
in
a
very
shrill
accent
,
and
after
it
cease
I
hear
one
of
them
cry
aloud
Tolgo
phonac
;
when
in
an
instant
I
feel
above
a
hundred
arrow
discharge
on
my
left
hand
,
which
,
prick
me
like
so
many
needle
;
and
besides
,
they
shoot
another
flight
into
the
air
,
as
we
do
bomb
in
Europe
,
whereof
many
,
I
suppose
,
fall
on
my
body
,
(
though
I
feel
them
not
)
,
and
some
on
my
face
,
which
I
immediately
cover
with
my
left
hand
.
 
<EOS>
when
this
shower
of
arrow
be
over
,
I
fall
a
groaning
with
grief
and
pain
;
and
then
strive
again
to
get
loose
,
they
discharge
another
volley
large
than
the
first
,
and
some
of
them
attempt
with
spear
to
stick
me
in
the
side
;
but
by
good
luck
I
have
on
a
buff
jerkin
,
which
they
could
not
pierce
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
the
most
prudent
method
to
lie
still
,
and
my
design
be
to
continue
so
till
night
,
when
,
my
left
hand
be
already
loose
,
I
could
easily
free
myself
:
 
and
as
for
the
inhabitant
,
I
have
reason
to
believe
I
may
be
a
match
for
the
great
army
they
could
bring
against
me
,
if
they
be
all
of
the
same
size
with
him
that
I
see
.
 
<EOS>
but
fortune
dispose
otherwise
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
people
observe
I
be
quiet
,
they
discharge
no
more
arrow
;
but
,
by
the
noise
I
hear
<EOS>
,
I
know
their
number
increase
;
and
about
four
yard
from
me
,
over
against
my
right
ear
,
I
hear
a
knocking
for
above
an
hour
,
like
that
of
people
at
work
;
when
turn
my
head
that
way
,
as
well
as
the
peg
and
string
would
permit
me
<EOS>
,
I
see
a
stage
erect
about
a
foot
and
a
half
from
the
ground
,
capable
of
hold
four
of
the
inhabitant
,
with
two
or
three
ladder
to
mount
it
:
from
whence
one
of
them
,
who
seem
to
be
a
person
of
quality
,
make
me
a
long
speech
,
whereof
I
understand
not
one
syllable
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
should
have
mention
,
that
before
the
principal
person
begin
his
oration
,
he
cry
out
three
time
,
Langro
dehul
san
(
these
word
and
the
former
be
afterwards
repeat
and
explain
to
me
)
;
whereupon
,
immediately
,
about
fifty
of
the
inhabitant
come
and
cut
the
string
that
fasten
the
left
side
of
my
head
,
which
give
me
the
liberty
of
turn
it
to
the
right
,
and
of
observe
the
person
and
gesture
of
him
that
be
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
He
appear
to
be
of
a
middle
age
,
and
tall
than
any
of
the
other
three
who
attend
him
<EOS>
,
whereof
one
be
a
page
that
hold
up
his
train
,
and
seem
to
be
somewhat
long
than
my
middle
finger
;
the
other
two
stand
one
on
each
side
to
support
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
act
every
part
of
an
orator
,
and
I
could
observe
many
period
of
threatening
,
and
other
of
promise
,
pity
,
and
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
I
answer
in
a
few
word
,
but
in
the
most
submissive
manner
,
lift
up
my
left
hand
,
and
both
my
eye
to
the
sun
,
as
call
him
for
a
witness
;
and
be
almost
famished
with
hunger
,
have
not
eat
a
morsel
for
some
hour
before
I
leave
the
ship
,
I
find
the
demand
of
nature
so
strong
upon
me
,
that
I
could
not
forbear
show
my
impatience
(
perhaps
against
the
strict
rule
of
decency
)
by
put
my
finger
frequently
to
my
mouth
,
to
signify
that
I
want
food
.
 
<EOS>
the
hurgo
(
for
so
they
call
a
great
lord
,
as
I
afterwards
learn
)
understand
me
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
He
descend
from
the
stage
,
and
command
that
several
ladder
should
be
apply
to
my
side
,
on
which
above
a
hundred
of
the
inhabitant
mount
and
walk
towards
my
mouth
,
laden
with
basket
full
of
meat
,
which
have
be
provide
and
send
thither
by
the
king
's
order
,
upon
the
first
intelligence
he
receive
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
observe
there
be
the
flesh
of
several
animal
,
but
could
not
distinguish
them
by
the
taste
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
shoulder
,
leg
,
and
loin
,
shape
like
those
of
mutton
,
and
very
well
dressed
,
but
small
than
the
wing
of
a
lark
.
 
<EOS>
I
eat
them
by
two
or
three
at
a
mouthful
,
and
take
three
loaf
at
a
time
,
about
the
bigness
of
musket
bullet
.
 
<EOS>
They
supply
me
as
fast
as
they
could
,
show
a
thousand
mark
of
wonder
and
astonishment
at
my
bulk
and
appetite
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
make
another
sign
,
that
I
want
drink
.
 
<EOS>
They
find
by
my
eating
that
a
small
quantity
would
not
suffice
me
;
and
be
a
most
ingenious
people
,
they
sling
up
,
with
great
dexterity
,
one
of
their
large
hogshead
,
then
roll
it
towards
my
hand
,
and
beat
out
the
top
;
I
drink
it
off
at
a
draught
,
which
I
may
well
do
,
for
it
do
not
hold
half
a
pint
,
and
taste
like
a
small
wine
of
Burgundy
,
but
much
more
delicious
.
 
<EOS>
They
bring
me
a
second
hogshead
,
which
I
drink
in
the
same
manner
,
and
make
sign
for
more
;
but
they
have
none
to
give
me
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
perform
these
wonder
,
they
shout
for
joy
,
and
dance
upon
my
breast
,
repeat
several
time
as
they
do
at
first
,
Hekinah
degul
.
 
<EOS>
They
make
me
a
sign
that
I
should
throw
down
the
two
hogshead
,
but
first
warn
the
people
below
to
stand
out
of
the
way
,
cry
aloud
,
Borach
mevolah
;
and
when
they
see
the
vessel
in
the
air
,
there
be
a
universal
shout
of
Hekinah
degul
.
 
<EOS>
I
confess
I
be
often
tempt
,
while
they
be
pass
backwards
and
forwards
on
my
body
,
to
seize
forty
or
fifty
of
the
first
that
come
in
my
reach
,
and
dash
them
against
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
remembrance
of
what
I
have
feel
,
which
probably
may
not
be
the
bad
they
could
do
,
and
the
promise
of
honour
<EOS>
I
make
them
 
for
<EOS>
so
I
interpret
my
submissive
behaviour
 
soon
drive
out
these
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
I
now
consider
myself
as
bind
by
the
law
of
hospitality
,
to
a
people
who
have
treat
me
with
so
much
expense
and
magnificence
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
in
my
thought
I
could
not
sufficiently
wonder
at
the
intrepidity
of
these
diminutive
mortal
,
who
durst
venture
to
mount
and
walk
upon
my
body
,
while
one
of
my
hand
be
at
liberty
,
without
tremble
at
the
very
sight
of
so
prodigious
a
creature
as
I
must
appear
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
after
some
time
,
when
they
observe
that
I
make
no
more
demand
for
meat
,
there
appear
before
me
a
person
of
high
rank
from
his
imperial
majesty
.
 
<EOS>
His
excellency
,
have
mount
on
the
small
of
my
right
leg
,
advanced
forwards
up
to
my
face
,
with
about
a
dozen
of
his
retinue
;
and
produce
his
credential
under
the
signet
royal
,
which
he
apply
close
to
my
eye
,
speak
about
ten
minute
without
any
sign
of
anger
,
but
with
a
kind
of
determinate
resolution
,
often
point
forwards
,
which
,
as
I
afterwards
find
,
be
towards
the
capital
city
,
about
half
a
mile
distant
;
whither
it
be
agree
by
his
majesty
in
council
that
I
must
be
convey
.
 
<EOS>
I
answer
in
few
word
,
but
to
no
purpose
,
and
make
a
sign
with
my
hand
that
be
loose
,
put
it
to
the
other
(
but
over
his
excellency
's
head
for
fear
of
hurt
him
or
his
train
)
and
then
to
my
own
head
and
body
,
to
signify
that
I
desire
my
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
It
appear
that
he
understand
me
well
enough
,
for
he
shake
his
head
by
way
of
disapprobation
,
and
hold
his
hand
in
a
posture
to
show
that
I
must
be
carry
as
a
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
make
other
sign
to
let
me
understand
that
I
should
have
meat
and
drink
enough
,
and
very
good
treatment
.
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
I
once
more
thought
of
attempt
to
break
my
bond
;
but
again
,
when
I
feel
the
smart
of
their
arrow
upon
my
face
and
hand
,
which
be
all
in
blister
,
and
many
of
the
dart
still
stick
in
them
,
and
observe
likewise
that
the
number
of
my
enemy
increase
,
I
give
token
to
let
them
know
that
they
may
do
with
me
what
they
please
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
,
the
hurgo
and
his
train
withdraw
,
with
much
civility
and
cheerful
countenance
.
<EOS>
soon
after
I
hear
a
general
shout
,
with
frequent
repetition
of
the
word
Peplom
selan
;
and
I
feel
great
number
of
people
on
my
left
side
relax
the
cord
to
such
a
degree
,
that
I
be
able
to
turn
upon
my
right
,
and
to
ease
myself
with
make
water
;
which
I
very
plentifully
do
,
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
people
;
who
,
conjecture
by
my
motion
what
I
be
go
to
do
,
immediately
open
to
the
right
and
leave
on
that
side
,
to
avoid
the
torrent
,
which
fall
with
such
noise
and
violence
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
before
this
,
they
have
daub
my
face
and
both
my
hand
with
a
sort
of
ointment
,
very
pleasant
to
the
smell
,
which
,
in
a
few
minute
,
remove
all
the
smart
of
their
arrow
.
 
<EOS>
these
circumstance
,
add
to
the
refreshment
I
have
receive
by
their
victual
and
drink
,
which
be
very
nourishing
,
dispose
me
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
I
sleep
about
eight
hour
,
as
I
be
afterwards
assure
;
and
it
be
no
wonder
,
for
the
physician
,
by
the
emperor
's
order
,
have
mingle
a
sleepy
potion
in
the
hogshead
of
wine
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
,
that
upon
the
first
moment
I
be
discover
sleep
on
the
ground
,
after
my
landing
,
the
emperor
have
early
notice
of
it
by
an
express
;
and
determine
in
council
,
that
I
should
be
tie
in
the
manner
I
have
relate
,
(
which
be
do
in
the
night
while
I
sleep
;
)
that
plenty
of
meat
and
drink
should
be
send
to
me
,
and
a
machine
prepare
to
carry
me
to
the
capital
city
.
  
<EOS>
this
resolution
perhaps
may
appear
very
bold
and
dangerous
,
and
I
be
confident
would
not
be
imitate
by
any
prince
in
Europe
on
the
like
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
in
my
opinion
,
it
be
extremely
prudent
,
as
well
as
generous
:
 
for
,
suppose
these
people
have
endeavour
to
kill
me
with
their
spear
and
arrow
,
while
I
be
asleep
<EOS>
,
I
should
certainly
have
awake
with
the
first
sense
of
smart
,
which
may
so
far
have
rouse
my
rage
and
strength
,
as
to
have
enable
me
to
break
the
string
<EOS>
wherewith
I
be
tie
;
after
which
,
as
they
be
not
able
to
make
resistance
,
so
they
could
expect
no
mercy
.
  
<EOS>
these
people
be
most
excellent
mathematician
,
and
arrive
to
a
great
perfection
in
mechanic
,
by
the
countenance
and
encouragement
of
the
emperor
,
who
be
a
renowned
patron
of
learn
.
 
<EOS>
this
prince
have
several
machine
fix
on
wheel
,
for
the
carriage
of
tree
and
other
great
weight
.
 
<EOS>
He
often
build
his
large
man
of
war
,
whereof
some
be
nine
foot
long
,
in
the
wood
where
the
timber
grow
,
and
have
them
carry
on
these
engine
three
or
four
hundred
yard
to
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
five
hundred
carpenter
and
engineer
be
immediately
set
at
work
to
prepare
the
great
engine
they
have
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
frame
of
wood
raise
three
inch
from
the
ground
,
about
seven
foot
long
,
and
four
wide
,
move
upon
twenty
-
two
wheel
.
 
<EOS>
the
shout
I
hear
be
upon
the
arrival
of
this
engine
,
which
,
it
seem
,
set
out
in
four
hour
after
my
landing
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
bring
parallel
to
me
,
as
I
lie
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
principal
difficulty
be
to
raise
and
place
me
in
this
vehicle
.
 
<EOS>
eighty
pole
,
each
of
one
foot
high
,
be
erect
for
this
purpose
,
and
very
strong
cord
,
of
the
bigness
of
packthread
,
be
fasten
by
hook
to
many
bandage
,
which
the
workman
have
girt
round
my
neck
,
my
hand
,
my
body
,
and
my
leg
.
<EOS>
nine
hundred
of
the
strong
man
be
employ
to
draw
up
these
cord
,
by
many
pulley
fasten
on
the
pole
;
and
thus
,
in
less
than
three
hour
,
I
be
raise
and
sling
into
the
engine
,
and
there
tie
fast
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
I
be
tell
;
for
,
while
the
operation
be
perform
,
I
lie
in
a
profound
sleep
,
by
the
force
of
that
soporiferous
medicine
infuse
into
my
liquor
.
 
<EOS>
fifteen
hundred
of
the
emperor
's
large
horse
,
each
about
four
inch
and
a
half
high
,
be
employ
to
draw
me
towards
the
metropolis
,
which
,
as
I
say
,
be
half
a
mile
distant
.
  
<EOS>
about
four
hour
after
we
begin
our
journey
,
I
awake
by
a
very
ridiculous
accident
;
for
the
carriage
being
stop
a
while
,
to
adjust
something
that
be
out
of
order
,
two
or
three
of
the
young
native
have
the
curiosity
to
see
how
I
look
when
I
be
asleep
;
they
climb
up
into
the
engine
,
and
advance
very
softly
to
my
face
,
one
of
them
,
an
officer
in
the
guard
,
put
the
sharp
end
of
his
half
-
pike
a
good
way
up
into
my
left
nostril
,
which
tickle
my
nose
like
a
straw
,
and
make
me
sneeze
violently
;
whereupon
they
steal
off
unperceived
,
and
it
be
three
week
before
I
know
the
cause
of
my
waking
so
suddenly
.
 
<EOS>
We
make
a
long
march
the
remain
part
of
the
day
,
and
,
rest
at
night
with
five
hundred
guard
on
each
side
of
me
,
half
with
torch
,
and
half
with
bow
and
arrow
,
ready
to
shoot
me
if
I
should
offer
to
stir
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
morning
at
sun
-
rise
we
continue
our
march
,
and
arrive
within
two
hundred
yard
of
the
city
gate
about
noon
.
 
<EOS>
the
emperor
,
and
all
his
court
,
come
out
to
meet
us
;
but
his
great
officer
would
by
no
mean
suffer
his
majesty
to
endanger
his
person
by
mount
on
my
body
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
place
where
the
carriage
stop
there
stand
an
ancient
temple
,
esteem
to
be
the
large
in
the
whole
kingdom
;
which
,
have
be
pollute
some
year
before
by
an
unnatural
murder
,
be
,
accord
to
the
zeal
of
those
people
,
look
upon
as
profane
,
and
therefore
have
be
apply
to
common
use
,
and
all
the
ornament
and
furniture
carry
away
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
edifice
it
be
determine
I
should
lodge
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
gate
front
to
the
north
be
about
four
foot
high
,
and
almost
two
foot
wide
,
through
which
I
could
easily
creep
.
<EOS>
on
each
side
of
the
gate
be
a
small
window
,
not
above
six
inch
from
the
ground
:
 
into
that
on
the
left
side
,
the
king
's
smith
convey
fourscore
and
eleven
chain
,
like
those
that
hang
to
a
lady
's
watch
in
Europe
,
and
almost
as
large
,
which
be
lock
to
my
left
leg
with
six
-
and
-
thirty
padlock
.
 
<EOS>
over
against
this
temple
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
great
highway
,
at
twenty
foot
distance
,
there
be
a
turret
at
least
five
foot
high
.
 
<EOS>
here
the
emperor
ascend
,
with
many
principal
lord
of
his
court
,
to
have
an
opportunity
of
view
me
,
as
I
be
tell
,
for
I
could
not
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
reckon
that
above
a
hundred
thousand
inhabitant
come
out
of
the
town
upon
the
same
errand
;
and
,
in
spite
of
my
guard
,
I
believe
there
could
not
be
few
than
ten
thousand
at
several
time
,
who
mount
my
body
by
the
help
of
ladder
.
 
<EOS>
but
a
proclamation
be
soon
issue
,
to
forbid
it
upon
pain
of
death
.
<EOS>
when
the
workman
find
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
break
loose
,
they
cut
all
the
string
that
bind
me
;
whereupon
I
rise
up
,
with
as
melancholy
a
disposition
as
ever
I
have
in
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
noise
and
astonishment
of
the
people
,
at
see
me
rise
and
walk
,
be
not
to
be
express
.
 
<EOS>
the
chain
that
hold
my
left
leg
be
about
two
yard
long
,
and
give
me
not
only
the
liberty
of
walk
backwards
and
forwards
in
a
semicircle
,
but
,
be
fix
within
four
inch
of
the
gate
,
allow
me
to
creep
in
,
and
lie
at
my
full
length
in
the
temple
.
   
<EOS>
the
emperor
of
Lilliput
,
attend
by
several
of
the
nobility
,
come
to
see
the
author
in
his
confinement
.
 
<EOS>
the
emperor
's
person
and
habit
describe
.
 
<EOS>
learned
man
appoint
to
teach
the
author
their
language
.
 
<EOS>
He
gain
favour
by
his
mild
disposition
.
 
<EOS>
His
pocket
be
search
,
and
his
sword
and
pistol
take
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
find
myself
on
my
foot
,
I
look
about
me
,
and
must
confess
I
never
beheld
a
more
entertaining
prospect
.
 
<EOS>
the
country
around
appear
like
a
continue
garden
,
and
the
enclose
field
,
which
be
generally
forty
foot
square
,
resemble
so
many
bed
of
flower
.
 
<EOS>
these
field
be
intermingle
with
wood
of
half
a
stang
,
{
1
}
and
the
tall
tree
,
as
I
could
judge
,
appear
to
be
seven
foot
high
.
 
<EOS>
I
view
the
town
on
my
left
hand
,
which
look
like
the
paint
scene
of
a
city
in
a
theatre
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
be
for
some
hour
extremely
press
by
the
necessity
of
nature
;
which
be
no
wonder
,
it
be
almost
two
day
since
I
have
last
disburden
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
under
great
difficulty
between
urgency
and
shame
.
 
<EOS>
the
good
expedient
I
could
think
of
,
be
to
creep
into
my
house
,
which
I
accordingly
do
;
and
shut
the
gate
after
me
<EOS>
,
I
go
as
far
as
the
length
of
my
chain
would
suffer
,
and
discharge
my
body
of
that
uneasy
load
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
the
only
time
I
be
ever
guilty
of
so
uncleanly
an
action
;
for
which
I
can
not
but
hope
the
candid
reader
will
give
some
allowance
,
after
he
have
maturely
and
impartially
consider
my
case
,
and
the
distress
I
be
in
.
 
<EOS>
from
this
time
my
constant
practice
be
,
as
soon
as
I
rise
,
to
perform
that
business
in
open
air
,
at
the
full
extent
of
my
chain
;
and
due
care
be
take
every
morning
before
company
come
,
that
the
offensive
matter
should
be
carry
off
in
wheel
-
barrow
,
by
two
servant
appoint
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
dwell
so
long
upon
a
circumstance
that
,
perhaps
,
at
first
sight
,
may
appear
not
very
momentous
,
if
I
have
not
think
it
necessary
to
justify
my
character
,
in
point
of
cleanliness
,
to
the
world
;
which
,
I
be
tell
,
some
of
my
maligner
have
be
please
,
upon
this
and
other
occasion
,
to
call
in
question
.
  
<EOS>
when
this
adventure
be
at
an
end
,
I
come
back
out
of
my
house
,
have
occasion
for
fresh
air
.
 
<EOS>
the
emperor
be
already
descend
from
the
tower
,
and
advance
on
horseback
towards
me
,
which
have
like
to
have
cost
him
dear
;
for
the
beast
,
though
very
well
train
,
yet
wholly
unused
to
such
a
sight
,
which
appear
as
if
a
mountain
move
before
him
,
rear
up
on
its
hinder
foot
:
 
but
<EOS>
that
prince
,
who
be
an
excellent
horseman
,
keep
his
seat
,
till
his
attendant
run
in
,
and
hold
the
bridle
,
while
his
majesty
have
time
to
dismount
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
alight
,
he
survey
me
round
with
great
admiration
;
but
keep
beyond
the
length
of
my
chain
.
 
<EOS>
He
order
his
cook
and
butler
,
who
be
already
prepare
,
to
give
me
victual
and
drink
,
which
they
push
forward
in
a
sort
of
vehicle
upon
wheel
,
till
I
could
reach
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
these
vehicle
and
soon
empty
them
all
;
twenty
of
them
be
fill
with
meat
,
and
ten
with
liquor
;
<EOS>
each
of
the
former
afford
me
two
or
three
good
mouthful
;
and
I
empty
the
liquor
of
ten
vessel
,
which
be
contain
in
earthen
vial
,
into
one
vehicle
,
drink
it
off
at
a
draught
;
and
so
I
do
with
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
the
empress
,
and
young
prince
of
the
blood
of
both
sex
,
attend
by
many
lady
,
sit
at
some
distance
in
their
chair
;
but
upon
the
accident
that
happen
to
the
emperor
's
horse
,
they
alight
,
and
come
near
his
person
,
which
I
be
now
go
to
describe
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
tall
by
almost
the
breadth
of
my
nail
,
than
any
of
his
court
;
which
alone
be
enough
to
strike
an
awe
into
the
beholder
.
 
<EOS>
His
feature
be
strong
and
masculine
,
with
an
austrian
lip
and
arch
nose
,
his
complexion
olive
,
his
countenance
erect
,
his
body
and
limb
well
proportion
,
all
his
motion
graceful
,
and
his
deportment
majestic
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
then
past
his
prime
,
be
twenty
-
eight
year
and
three
quarter
old
,
of
which
he
have
reign
about
seven
in
great
felicity
,
and
generally
victorious
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
well
convenience
of
behold
him
,
I
lie
on
my
side
,
so
that
my
face
be
parallel
to
his
,
and
he
stand
but
three
yard
off
:
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
have
have
him
since
many
time
in
my
hand
,
and
therefore
can
not
be
deceive
in
the
description
.
 
<EOS>
His
dress
be
very
plain
and
simple
,
and
the
fashion
of
it
between
the
Asiatic
and
the
European
;
but
he
have
on
his
head
a
light
helmet
of
gold
,
adorn
with
jewel
,
and
a
plume
on
the
crest
.
 
<EOS>
He
hold
his
sword
draw
in
his
hand
to
defend
himself
,
if
I
should
happen
to
break
loose
;
it
be
almost
three
inch
long
;
the
hilt
and
scabbard
be
gold
enrich
with
diamond
.
 
<EOS>
His
voice
be
shrill
,
but
very
clear
and
articulate
;
and
I
could
distinctly
hear
it
when
I
stand
up
.
 
<EOS>
the
lady
and
courtier
be
all
most
magnificently
clothe
;
so
that
the
spot
they
stand
upon
seem
to
resemble
a
petticoat
spread
upon
the
ground
,
embroider
with
figure
of
gold
and
silver
.
 
<EOS>
His
imperial
majesty
speak
often
to
me
,
and
I
return
answer
:
 
<EOS>
but
neither
of
us
could
understand
a
syllable
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
several
of
his
priest
and
lawyer
present
(
as
I
conjecture
by
their
habit
)
,
who
be
command
to
address
themselves
to
me
;
and
I
speak
to
them
in
as
many
language
as
I
have
the
least
smattering
of
,
which
be
high
and
Low
Dutch
,
latin
,
french
,
spanish
,
italian
,
and
Lingua
Franca
,
but
all
to
no
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
after
about
two
hour
the
court
retire
,
and
I
be
leave
with
a
strong
guard
,
to
prevent
the
impertinence
,
and
probably
the
malice
of
the
rabble
,
who
be
very
impatient
to
crowd
about
me
as
near
as
they
durst
;
and
some
of
them
have
the
impudence
to
shoot
their
arrow
at
me
,
as
I
sit
on
the
ground
by
the
door
of
my
house
,
whereof
one
very
narrowly
miss
my
left
eye
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
colonel
order
six
of
the
ringleader
to
be
seize
,
and
think
no
punishment
so
proper
as
to
deliver
them
bind
into
my
hand
;
which
some
of
his
soldier
accordingly
do
,
push
them
forward
with
the
butt
-
end
of
their
pike
into
my
reach
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
them
all
in
my
right
hand
,
put
five
of
them
into
my
coat
-
pocket
;
and
as
to
the
sixth
,
I
make
a
countenance
as
if
I
would
eat
him
alive
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
man
squall
terribly
,
and
the
colonel
and
his
officer
be
in
much
pain
,
especially
when
they
see
me
take
out
my
penknife
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
soon
put
them
out
of
fear
;
for
,
look
mildly
,
and
immediately
cut
the
string
he
be
bind
with
,
I
set
him
gently
on
the
ground
,
and
away
he
run
.
 
<EOS>
I
treat
the
rest
in
the
same
manner
,
take
them
one
by
one
out
of
my
pocket
;
and
I
observe
both
the
soldier
and
people
be
highly
delighted
at
this
mark
of
my
clemency
,
which
be
represent
very
much
to
my
advantage
at
court
.
  
<EOS>
towards
night
I
get
with
some
difficulty
into
my
house
,
where
I
lie
on
the
ground
,
and
continue
to
do
so
about
a
fortnight
;
during
which
time
,
the
emperor
give
order
to
have
a
bed
prepare
for
me
.
<EOS>
six
hundred
bed
of
the
common
measure
be
bring
in
carriage
,
and
work
up
in
my
house
;
a
hundred
and
fifty
of
their
bed
,
sew
together
,
make
up
the
breadth
and
length
;
and
these
be
four
double
:
 
<EOS>
which
,
however
,
keep
me
but
very
indifferently
from
the
hardness
of
the
floor
,
that
be
of
smooth
stone
.
 
<EOS>
by
the
same
computation
,
they
provide
me
with
sheet
,
blanket
,
and
coverlet
,
tolerable
enough
for
one
who
have
be
so
long
inure
to
hardship
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
news
of
my
arrival
spread
through
the
kingdom
,
it
bring
prodigious
number
of
rich
,
idle
,
and
curious
people
to
see
me
;
so
that
the
village
be
almost
empty
;
and
great
neglect
of
tillage
and
household
affair
must
have
ensue
,
if
his
imperial
majesty
have
not
provide
,
by
several
proclamation
and
order
of
state
,
against
this
inconveniency
.
 
<EOS>
He
direct
that
those
who
have
already
beheld
me
should
return
home
,
and
not
presume
to
come
within
fifty
yard
of
my
house
,
without
license
from
the
court
;
whereby
the
secretary
of
state
get
considerable
fee
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
the
emperor
hold
frequent
council
,
to
debate
what
course
should
be
take
with
me
;
and
I
be
afterwards
assure
by
a
particular
friend
,
a
person
of
great
quality
,
who
be
as
much
in
the
secret
as
any
,
that
the
court
be
under
many
difficulty
concern
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
apprehend
my
breaking
loose
;
that
my
diet
would
be
very
expensive
,
and
may
cause
a
famine
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
they
determine
to
starve
me
;
or
at
least
to
shoot
me
in
the
face
and
hand
with
poison
arrow
,
which
would
soon
despatch
me
;
but
again
they
consider
,
that
the
stench
of
so
large
a
carcass
may
produce
a
plague
in
the
metropolis
,
and
probably
spread
through
the
whole
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
these
consultation
,
several
officer
of
the
army
go
to
the
door
of
the
great
council
-
chamber
,
and
two
of
them
be
admit
,
give
an
account
of
my
behaviour
to
the
six
criminal
above
-
mention
;
which
make
so
favourable
an
impression
in
the
breast
of
his
majesty
and
the
whole
board
,
in
my
behalf
,
that
an
imperial
commission
be
issue
out
,
oblige
all
the
village
,
nine
hundred
yard
round
the
city
,
to
deliver
in
every
morning
six
beef
,
forty
sheep
,
and
other
victual
for
my
sustenance
;
together
with
a
proportionable
quantity
of
bread
,
and
wine
,
and
other
liquor
;
for
the
due
payment
of
which
,
his
majesty
give
assignment
upon
his
treasury
:
  
<EOS>
for
this
prince
live
chiefly
upon
his
own
demesne
;
seldom
,
except
upon
great
occasion
,
raise
any
subsidy
upon
his
subject
,
who
be
bind
to
attend
him
in
his
war
at
their
own
expense
.
 
<EOS>
an
establishment
be
also
make
of
six
hundred
person
to
be
my
domestic
,
who
have
board
-
wage
allow
for
their
maintenance
,
and
tent
build
for
them
very
conveniently
on
each
side
of
my
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
likewise
order
,
that
three
hundred
tailor
should
make
me
a
suit
of
clothe
,
after
the
fashion
of
the
country
;
that
six
of
his
majesty
's
great
scholar
should
be
employ
to
instruct
me
in
their
language
;
and
lastly
,
that
the
emperor
's
horse
,
and
those
of
the
nobility
and
troop
of
guard
,
should
be
frequently
exercise
in
my
sight
,
to
accustom
themselves
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
all
these
order
be
duly
put
in
execution
;
and
in
about
three
week
I
make
a
great
progress
in
learn
their
language
;
during
which
time
the
emperor
frequently
honour
me
with
his
visit
,
and
be
pleased
to
assist
my
master
in
teach
me
.
 
<EOS>
We
begin
already
to
converse
together
in
some
sort
;
and
the
first
word
I
learn
,
be
to
express
my
desire
"
that
he
would
please
give
me
my
liberty
;
"
which
I
every
day
repeat
on
my
knee
.
 
<EOS>
His
answer
,
as
I
could
comprehend
it
,
be
,
"
that
this
must
be
a
work
of
time
,
not
to
be
think
on
without
the
advice
of
his
council
,
and
that
first
I
must
lumos
kelmin
pesso
desmar
lon
emposo
;
"
that
is
,
swear
a
peace
with
him
and
his
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
that
I
should
be
use
with
all
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
advise
me
to
"
acquire
,
by
my
patience
and
discreet
behaviour
,
the
good
opinion
of
himself
and
his
subject
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
desire
"
I
would
not
take
it
ill
,
if
he
give
order
to
certain
proper
officer
to
search
me
;
for
probably
I
may
carry
about
me
several
weapon
,
which
must
needs
be
dangerous
thing
,
if
they
answer
the
bulk
of
so
prodigious
a
person
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
His
majesty
should
be
satisfied
;
for
I
be
ready
to
strip
myself
,
and
turn
up
my
pocket
before
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
I
deliver
part
in
word
,
and
part
in
sign
.
 
<EOS>
He
reply
,
"
that
,
by
the
law
of
the
kingdom
,
I
must
be
search
by
two
of
his
officer
;
that
he
know
this
could
not
be
do
without
my
consent
and
assistance
;
and
he
have
so
good
an
opinion
of
my
generosity
and
justice
,
as
to
trust
their
person
in
my
hand
;
that
whatever
they
take
from
me
,
should
be
return
when
I
leave
the
country
,
or
pay
for
at
the
rate
which
I
would
set
upon
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
take
up
the
two
officer
in
my
hand
,
put
them
first
into
my
coat
-
pocket
,
and
then
into
every
other
pocket
about
me
,
except
my
two
fobs
,
and
<EOS>
another
secret
pocket
,
which
I
have
no
mind
should
be
search
,
wherein
I
have
some
little
necessary
that
be
of
no
consequence
to
any
but
myself
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
of
my
fobs
there
be
a
silver
watch
,
and
in
the
other
a
small
quantity
of
gold
in
a
purse
.
 
<EOS>
these
gentleman
,
have
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
about
them
,
make
an
exact
inventory
of
every
thing
they
see
;
and
when
they
have
do
,
desire
I
would
set
them
down
,
that
they
may
deliver
it
to
the
emperor
.
 
<EOS>
this
inventory
I
afterwards
translate
into
English
,
and
be
,
word
for
word
,
as
follow
:
  
"
Imprimis
:
 
<EOS>
in
the
right
coat
-
pocket
of
the
great
man
-
mountain
"
(
for
so
I
interpret
the
word
quinbus
flestrin
,
)
"
<EOS>
after
the
strict
search
,
we
find
only
one
great
piece
of
coarse
-
cloth
,
large
enough
to
be
a
foot
-
cloth
for
your
majesty
's
chief
room
of
state
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
left
pocket
we
see
a
huge
silver
chest
,
with
a
cover
of
the
same
metal
,
which
we
,
the
searcher
,
be
not
able
to
lift
.
<EOS>
We
desire
it
should
be
open
,
and
one
of
us
step
into
it
,
find
himself
up
to
the
mid
leg
in
a
sort
of
dust
,
some
part
whereof
fly
up
to
our
face
set
us
both
a
sneezing
for
several
time
together
.
 
<EOS>
in
his
right
waistcoat
-
pocket
we
find
a
prodigious
bundle
of
white
thin
substance
,
fold
one
over
another
,
about
the
bigness
of
three
man
,
tie
with
a
strong
cable
,
and
mark
with
black
figure
;
which
we
humbly
conceive
to
be
writing
,
every
letter
almost
half
as
large
as
the
palm
of
our
hand
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
left
there
be
a
sort
of
engine
,
from
the
back
of
which
be
extend
twenty
long
pole
,
resemble
the
pallisado
before
your
majesty
's
court
:
 
<EOS>
wherewith
we
conjecture
the
man
-
mountain
comb
his
head
;
for
we
do
not
always
trouble
him
with
question
,
because
we
find
it
a
great
difficulty
to
make
him
understand
us
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
large
pocket
,
on
the
right
side
of
his
middle
cover
"
(
so
I
translate
the
word
ranfulo
,
by
which
they
mean
my
breech
,
)
<EOS>
"
we
see
a
hollow
pillar
of
iron
,
about
the
length
of
a
man
,
fasten
to
a
strong
piece
of
timber
large
than
the
pillar
;
and
upon
one
side
of
the
pillar
,
be
huge
piece
of
iron
stick
out
,
cut
into
strange
figure
,
which
we
know
not
what
to
make
of
.
<EOS>
in
the
left
pocket
,
another
engine
of
the
same
kind
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
small
pocket
on
the
right
side
,
be
several
round
flat
piece
of
white
and
red
metal
,
of
different
bulk
;
some
of
the
white
,
which
seem
to
be
silver
,
be
so
large
and
heavy
,
that
my
comrade
and
I
could
hardly
lift
them
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
left
pocket
be
two
black
pillar
irregularly
shape
:
 
we
could
not
,
without
difficulty
,
reach
the
top
of
them
,
as
we
stand
at
the
bottom
of
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
them
be
cover
,
and
seem
all
of
a
piece
:
 
but
at
the
upper
end
of
the
other
there
appear
a
white
round
substance
,
about
twice
the
bigness
of
our
head
.
 
<EOS>
within
each
of
these
be
enclose
a
prodigious
plate
of
steel
;
which
,
by
our
order
,
we
oblige
him
to
show
us
,
because
we
apprehend
they
may
be
dangerous
engine
.
<EOS>
He
take
them
out
of
their
case
,
and
tell
us
,
that
in
his
own
country
his
practice
be
to
shave
his
beard
with
one
of
these
,
and
cut
his
meat
with
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
two
pocket
which
we
could
not
enter
:
 
these
he
call
his
fobs
;
they
be
two
large
slit
cut
into
the
top
of
his
middle
cover
,
but
squeeze
close
by
the
pressure
of
his
belly
.
 
<EOS>
out
of
the
right
fob
hang
a
great
silver
chain
,
with
a
wonderful
kind
of
engine
at
the
bottom
.
 
<EOS>
We
direct
him
to
draw
out
whatever
be
at
the
end
of
that
chain
;
which
appear
to
be
a
globe
,
half
silver
,
and
half
of
some
transparent
metal
;
for
,
on
the
transparent
side
,
we
see
certain
strange
figure
circularly
draw
,
and
think
we
could
touch
them
,
till
we
find
our
finger
stop
by
the
lucid
substance
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
this
engine
into
our
ear
,
which
make
an
incessant
noise
,
like
that
of
a
water
-
mill
:
<EOS>
and
we
conjecture
it
be
either
some
unknown
animal
,
or
the
god
that
he
worship
;
but
we
be
more
inclined
to
the
latter
opinion
,
because
he
assure
us
,

He

out

contrive
to
open
and
shut
like

and
serve
him
for
the

use

<EOS>
we
find
therein
several
massy
piece
of
yellow
metal

which
,
if
they

must
be
of
immense

"
  
<EOS>
when
this
inventory
be
read
over
to
the
emperor
,
he
direct
me
,
although
in
very
gentle
term
,
to
deliver
up
the
several
particular
.
 
<EOS>
He
first
call
for
my
scimitar
,
which
I
take
out
,
scabbard
and
all
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
he
order
three
thousand
of
his
choice
troop
(
who
then
attend
him
)
to
surround
me
at
a
distance
,
with
their
bow
and
arrow
just
ready
to
discharge
;
but
I
do
not
observe
it
,
for
mine
eye
be
wholly
fix
upon
his
majesty
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
desire
me
to
draw
my
scimitar
,
which
,
although
it
have
get
some
rust
by
the
sea
water
,
be
,
in
most
part
,
exceed
bright
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
so
,
and
immediately
all
the
troop
give
a
shout
between
terror
and
surprise
;
for
the
sun
shine
clear
,
and
the
reflection
dazzle
their
eye
,
as
I
wave
the
scimitar
to
and
fro
in
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
His
majesty
,
who
be
a
most
magnanimous
prince
,
be
less
daunted
than
I
could
expect
:
 
he
order
me
to
return
it
into
the
scabbard
,
and
cast
it
on
the
ground
as
gently
as
I
could
,
about
six
foot
from
the
end
of
my
chain
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
thing
he
demand
be
one
of
the
hollow
iron
pillar
;
by
which
he
mean
my
pocket
pistol
.
 
<EOS>
I
draw
it
out
,
and
at
his
desire
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
express
to
him
the
use
of
it
;
and
charge
it
only
with
powder
,
which
,
by
the
closeness
of
my
pouch
,
happen
to
escape
wetting
in
the
sea
(
an
inconvenience
against
which
all
prudent
mariner
take
special
care
to
provide
,
)
<EOS>
I
first
caution
the
emperor
not
to
be
afraid
,
and
then
I
let
it
off
in
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
the
astonishment
here
be
much
great
than
at
the
sight
of
my
scimitar
.
 
<EOS>
hundred
fall
down
as
if
they
have
be
strike
dead
;
and
even
the
emperor
,
although
he
stand
his
ground
,
could
not
recover
himself
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
deliver
up
both
my
pistol
in
the
same
manner
as
I
have
do
my
scimitar
,
and
then
my
pouch
of
powder
and
bullet
;
beg
him
that
the
former
may
be
keep
from
fire
,
for
it
would
kindle
with
the
small
spark
,
and
blow
up
his
imperial
palace
into
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
I
likewise
deliver
up
my
watch
,
which
the
emperor
be
very
curious
to
see
,
and
command
two
of
his
tall
yeoman
of
the
guard
to
bear
it
on
a
pole
upon
their
shoulder
,
as
drayman
in
England
do
a
barrel
of
ale
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
amazed
at
the
continual
noise
it
make
,
and
the
motion
of
the
minute
-
hand
,
which
he
could
easily
discern
;
for
their
sight
be
much
more
acute
than
our
:
 
he
ask
the
opinion
of
his
learn
man
about
it
,
which
be
various
and
remote
,
as
the
reader
may
well
imagine
without
my
repeating
;
although
indeed
I
could
not
very
perfectly
understand
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
give
up
my
silver
and
copper
money
,
my
purse
,
with
nine
large
piece
of
gold
,
and
some
small
one
;
my
knife
and
razor
,
my
comb
and
silver
snuff
-
box
,
my
handkerchief
and
journal
-
book
.
 
<EOS>
My
scimitar
,
pistol
,
and
pouch
,
be
convey
in
carriage
to
his
majesty
's
store
;
but
the
rest
of
my
good
be
return
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
as
I
before
observe
,
one
private
pocket
,
which
escape
their
search
<EOS>
,
wherein
there
be
a
pair
of
spectacle
(
which
I
sometimes
use
for
the
weakness
of
mine
eye
,
)
a
pocket
perspective
,
and
some
other
little
convenience
;
which
,
be
of
no
consequence
to
the
emperor
,
I
do
not
think
myself
bind
in
honour
to
discover
,
and
I
apprehend
they
may
be
lose
or
spoil
if
I
venture
them
out
of
my
possession
.
   
<EOS>
the
author
divert
the
emperor
,
and
his
nobility
of
both
sex
,
in
a
very
uncommon
manner
.
 
<EOS>
the
diversion
of
the
court
of
Lilliput
describe
.
 
<EOS>
the
author
have
his
liberty
grant
him
upon
certain
condition
.
 
<EOS>
My
gentleness
and
good
behaviour
have
gain
so
far
on
the
emperor
and
his
court
,
and
indeed
upon
the
army
and
people
in
general
,
that
I
begin
to
conceive
hope
of
get
my
liberty
in
a
short
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
all
possible
method
to
cultivate
this
favourable
disposition
.
<EOS>
the
native
come
,
by
degree
,
to
be
less
apprehensive
of
any
danger
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
sometimes
lie
down
,
and
let
five
or
six
of
them
dance
on
my
hand
;
and
at
last
the
boy
and
girl
would
venture
to
come
and
play
at
hide
-
and
-
seek
in
my
hair
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
now
make
a
good
progress
in
understanding
and
speak
the
language
.
 
<EOS>
the
emperor
have
a
mind
one
day
to
entertain
me
with
several
of
the
country
show
,
wherein
they
exceed
all
nation
I
have
know
,
both
for
dexterity
and
magnificence
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
divert
with
none
so
much
as
that
of
the
rope
-
dancer
,
perform
upon
a
slender
white
thread
,
extend
about
two
foot
,
and
twelve
inch
from
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
upon
which
I
shall
desire
liberty
,
with
the
reader
's
patience
,
to
enlarge
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
this
diversion
be
only
practise
by
those
person
who
be
candidate
for
great
employment
,
and
high
favour
at
court
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
train
in
this
art
from
their
youth
,
and
be
not
always
of
noble
birth
,
or
liberal
education
.
 
<EOS>
when
a
great
office
be
vacant
,
either
by
death
or
disgrace
(
which
often
happen
,
)
<EOS>
five
or
six
of
those
candidate
petition
the
emperor
to
entertain
his
majesty
and
the
court
with
a
dance
on
the
rope
;
and
whoever
jump
the
high
,
without
fall
,
succeed
in
the
office
.
 
<EOS>
very
often
the
chief
minister
themselves
be
command
to
show
their
skill
,
and
to
convince
the
emperor
that
they
have
not
lose
their
faculty
.
<EOS>
Flimnap
,
the
treasurer
,
be
allow
to
cut
a
caper
on
the
straight
rope
,
at
least
an
inch
high
than
any
other
lord
in
the
whole
empire
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
him
do
the
summerset
several
time
together
,
upon
a
trencher
fix
on
a
rope
which
be
no
thick
than
a
common
packthread
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
My
friend
Reldresal
,
principal
secretary
for
private
affair
,
be
,
in
my
opinion
,
if
I
be
not
partial
,
the
second
after
the
treasurer
;
the
rest
of
the
great
officer
be
much
upon
a
par
.
  
<EOS>
these
diversion
be
often
attend
with
fatal
accident
,
whereof
great
number
be
on
record
.
 
<EOS>
I
myself
have
see
two
or
three
candidate
break
a
limb
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
danger
be
much
great
,
when
the
minister
themselves
be
command
to
show
their
dexterity
;
for
,
by
contend
to
excel
themselves
and
their
fellow
,
they
strain
so
far
that
there
be
hardly
one
of
them
who
have
not
receive
a
fall
,
and
some
of
them
two
or
three
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
assure
that
,
a
year
or
two
before
my
arrival
,
Flimnap
would
infallibly
have
break
his
neck
,
if
one
of
the
king
's
cushion
,
that
accidentally
lie
on
the
ground
,
have
not
weaken
the
force
of
his
fall
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
likewise
another
diversion
,
which
be
only
show
before
the
emperor
and
empress
,
and
first
minister
,
upon
particular
occasion
.
<EOS>
the
emperor
lay
on
the
table
three
fine
silken
thread
of
six
inch
long
;
one
be
blue
,
the
other
red
,
and
the
third
green
.
<EOS>
these
thread
be
propose
as
prize
for
those
person
whom
the
emperor
have
a
mind
to
distinguish
by
a
peculiar
mark
of
his
favour
.
<EOS>
the
ceremony
be
perform
in
his
majesty
's
great
chamber
of
state
,
where
the
candidate
be
to
undergo
a
trial
of
dexterity
very
different
from
the
former
,
and
<EOS>
such
as
I
have
not
observe
the
least
resemblance
of
in
any
other
country
of
the
new
or
old
world
.
<EOS>
the
emperor
hold
a
stick
in
his
hand
,
both
end
parallel
to
the
horizon
,
while
the
candidate
advance
,
one
by
one
,
sometimes
leap
over
the
stick
,
sometimes
creep
under
it
,
backward
and
forward
,
several
time
,
accord
as
the
stick
be
advanced
or
depressed
.
<EOS>
sometimes
the
emperor
hold
one
end
of
the
stick
,
and
his
first
minister
the
other
;
sometimes
the
minister
have
it
entirely
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
whoever
perform
his
part
with
most
agility
,
and
hold
out
the
long
in
leap
and
creeping
,
be
reward
with
the
blue
-
coloured
silk
;
the
red
be
give
to
the
next
,
and
the
green
to
the
third
,
which
they
all
wear
girt
twice
round
about
the
middle
;
and
you
see
few
great
person
about
this
court
who
be
not
adorn
with
one
of
these
girdle
.
  
<EOS>
the
horse
of
the
army
,
and
those
of
the
royal
stable
,
have
be
daily
lead
before
me
,
be
no
longer
shy
,
but
would
come
up
to
my
very
foot
without
start
.
 
<EOS>
the
rider
would
leap
them
over
my
hand
,
as
I
hold
it
on
the
ground
;
and
one
of
the
emperor
's
huntsman
,
upon
a
large
courser
,
take
my
foot
,
shoe
and
all
;
which
be
indeed
a
prodigious
leap
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
the
good
fortune
to
divert
the
emperor
one
day
after
a
very
extraordinary
manner
.
 
<EOS>
I
desire
he
would
order
several
stick
of
two
foot
high
,
and
the
thickness
of
an
ordinary
cane
,
to
be
bring
me
;
whereupon
his
majesty
command
the
master
of
his
wood
to
give
direction
accordingly
;
and
the
next
morning
six
woodman
arrive
with
as
many
carriage
,
draw
by
eight
horse
to
each
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
nine
of
these
stick
,
and
fix
them
firmly
in
the
ground
in
a
quadrangular
figure
,
<EOS>
two
foot
and
a
half
square
<EOS>
,
I
take
four
other
stick
,
and
tie
them
parallel
at
each
corner
,
about
two
foot
from
the
ground
;
then
I
fasten
my
handkerchief
to
the
nine
stick
that
stand
erect
;
and
extend
it
on
all
side
,
till
it
be
tight
as
the
top
of
a
drum
;
and
the
four
parallel
stick
,
rise
about
five
inch
high
than
the
handkerchief
,
serve
as
ledge
on
each
side
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
finish
my
work
,
I
desire
the
emperor
to
let
a
troop
of
his
good
horse
twenty
-
four
in
number
,
come
and
exercise
upon
this
plain
.
 
<EOS>
His
majesty
approve
of
the
proposal
,
and
I
take
them
up
,
one
by
one
,
in
my
hand
,
ready
mount
and
armed
,
with
the
proper
officer
to
exercise
them
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
get
into
order
they
divide
into
two
party
,
perform
mock
skirmish
,
discharge
blunt
arrow
,
draw
their
sword
,
flee
and
pursue
,
attack
and
retire
,
and
in
short
discover
the
good
military
discipline
I
ever
beheld
.
 
<EOS>
the
parallel
stick
secure
them
and
their
horse
from
fall
over
the
stage
;
and
the
emperor
be
so
much
delighted
,
that
he
order
this
entertainment
to
be
repeat
several
day
,
and
once
be
pleased
to
be
lift
up
and
give
the
word
of
command
;
and
with
great
difficulty
persuade
even
the
empress
herself
to
let
me
hold
her
in
her
close
chair
within
two
yard
of
the
stage
,
when
she
be
able
to
take
a
full
view
of
the
whole
performance
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
my
good
fortune
,
that
no
ill
accident
happen
in
these
entertainment
;
only
once
a
fiery
horse
,
that
belong
to
one
of
the
captain
,
paw
with
his
hoof
,
strike
a
hole
in
my
handkerchief
,
and
his
foot
slip
,
he
overthrow
his
rider
and
himself
;
but
I
immediately
relieve
them
both
,
and
cover
the
hole
with
one
hand
,
I
set
down
the
troop
with
the
other
,
in
the
same
manner
as
I
take
them
up
.
<EOS>
the
horse
that
fall
be
strain
in
the
left
shoulder
,
but
the
rider
get
no
hurt
;
and
I
repair
my
handkerchief
as
well
as
I
could
:
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
would
not
trust
to
the
strength
of
it
any
more
,
in
such
dangerous
enterprise
.
  
<EOS>
about
two
or
three
day
before
I
be
set
at
liberty
,
as
I
be
entertain
the
court
with
this
kind
of
feat
,
there
arrive
an
express
to
inform
his
majesty
,
that
some
of
his
subject
,
ride
near
the
place
where
I
be
first
take
up
,
have
see
a
great
black
substance
lie
on
the
around
,
very
oddly
shaped
,
extend
its
edge
round
,
as
wide
as
his
majesty
's
bedchamber
,
and
rise
up
in
the
middle
as
high
as
a
man
;
that
it
be
no
live
creature
,
as
they
at
first
apprehend
,
for
it
lie
on
the
grass
without
motion
;
and
some
of
them
have
walk
round
it
several
time
;
that
,
by
mount
upon
each
other
's
shoulder
,
they
have
get
to
the
top
,
which
be
flat
and
even
,
and
,
stamp
upon
it
,
they
find
that
it
be
hollow
within
;
that
they
humbly
conceive
it
may
be
something
belong
to
the
man
-
mountain
;
and
if
his
majesty
please
,
they
would
undertake
to
bring
it
with
only
five
horse
.
 
<EOS>
I
presently
know
what
they
mean
,
and
be
glad
at
heart
to
receive
this
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
,
upon
my
first
reach
the
shore
after
our
shipwreck
,
I
be
in
such
confusion
,
that
before
I
come
to
the
place
where
I
go
to
sleep
,
my
hat
,
which
I
have
fasten
with
a
string
to
my
head
while
I
be
row
,
and
have
stick
on
all
the
time
I
be
swim
,
fall
off
after
I
come
to
land
;
the
string
,
as
I
conjecture
,
break
by
some
accident
,
which
I
never
observe
,
but
think
my
hat
have
be
lose
at
sea
.
 
<EOS>
I
entreat
his
imperial
majesty
to
give
order
<EOS>
it
may
be
bring
to
me
as
soon
as
possible
,
describe
to
him
the
use
and
the
nature
of
it
:
 
and
the
next
day
the
waggoner
arrive
with
it
,
but
not
in
a
very
good
condition
;
they
have
bore
two
hole
in
the
brim
,
within
an
inch
and
half
of
the
edge
,
and
fasten
two
hook
in
the
hole
;
these
hook
be
tie
by
a
long
cord
to
the
harness
,
and
thus
my
hat
be
drag
along
for
above
half
an
english
mile
;
but
,
the
ground
in
that
country
be
extremely
smooth
and
level
,
it
receive
less
damage
than
I
expect
.
  
<EOS>
two
day
after
this
adventure
,
the
emperor
,
have
order
that
part
of
his
army
which
quarter
in
and
about
his
metropolis
,
to
be
in
readiness
,
take
a
fancy
of
divert
himself
in
a
very
singular
manner
.
 
<EOS>
He
desire
I
would
stand
like
a
Colossus
,
with
my
leg
as
far
asunder
as
I
conveniently
could

<EOS>
He
then
command
his
general
(
who
be
an
old
experienced
leader
,
and
a
great
patron
of
mine
)
to
draw
up
the
troop
in
close
order
,
and
march
them
under
me
;

twenty
-
four
abreast

and

with

upon
pain
of
death
,
that
every
soldier
in
his
march
should
observe
the
strict
decency
with
regard
to
my

;
which
however
could
not
prevent
some
of
the
young
officer
from
turn
up
their
eye
as
they
pass
under
me
:
 
and
,
to
confess
the
truth
<EOS>
,
my
breech
be
at
that
time
in
so
ill
a
condition
,
that
they
afford
some
opportunity
for
laughter
and
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
send
so
many
memorial
and
petition
for
my
liberty
,
that
his

at
length

the
matter
,
first
in

who
be
pleased

without

but
it

carry
against

confirm
by
the

<EOS>
that

very
much

of

morose
and
sour
complexion

<EOS>
however
,

at
length

to
comply
;
but
prevail
that
the
article
and
condition
upon
which
I
should
be
set
free

and
to
which
I
must
swear
,
should

<EOS>
after
they

I
be
demand

<EOS>
some
time
after

ask
a

court
how
they
come

fix
on

he
tell
me

his

have
take

exceed
theirs

the
proportion
of
twelve

they
conclude
from
the
similarity
of
their
body
,
that
mine
must
contain
at
least
1724
of
theirs
,

consequently
would
require

much
food

be
necessary

support
that
number

by
which
the

may
conceive
an
idea

<EOS>
the
first
request
I
make

after
I
have
obtain

be
,
that
I
may
have
license
to
see
Mildendo
,
the

which
the

easily
grant
me
,
but
with
a
special
charge
to
do
no
hurt
either
to
the
inhabitant
or
their
house

<EOS>
the
people
have
notice
,
by
proclamation
,
of
my
design
to
visit
the
town

<EOS>
the
wall
which
encompass
it
be
two
foot
and
a
half
high
,
and
<EOS>
at
least
eleven
inch
broad
,
so
that
a
coach
and
horse
may
be
drive
very
safely
round
it
;
and
it
be
flank
with
strong
tower
at
ten
foot
distance
.
 
<EOS>
I
step
over
the
great
western
gate
,
and
pass
very
gently
,
and
sidle
,
through
the
two
principal
street
,
only
in
my
short
waistcoat
,
for
fear
of
damage
the
roof
and
eave
of
the
house
with
the
skirt
of
my
coat
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
with
the
utmost
circumspection
,
to
avoid
tread
on
any
straggler
who
may
remain
in
the
street
,
although
the
order
be
very
strict
,
that
all
people
should
keep
in
their
house
,
at
their
own
peril
.
 
<EOS>
the
garret
window
and
top
of
house
be
so
crowded
with
spectator
,
that
I
think
in
all
my
travel
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
a
more
populous
place
.
 
<EOS>
the
city
be
an
exact
square
,
each
side
of
the
wall
be
five
hundred
foot
long
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
great
street
,
which
run
across
and
divide
it
into
four
quarter
,
be
five
foot
wide
.
 
<EOS>
the
lane
and
alley
,
which
I
could
not
enter
,
but
only
view
them
as
I
pass
,
be
from
twelve
to
eighteen
inch
.
 
<EOS>
the
town
be
capable
of
hold
five
hundred
thousand
soul
:
 
<EOS>
the
house
be
from
three
to
five
story
:
 
the
shop
and
market
well
provide
.
  
<EOS>
the
emperor
's
palace
be
in
the
centre
of
the
city
where
the
two
great
street
meet
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
enclose
by
a
wall
of
two
foot
high
,
and
twenty
foot
distance
from
the
building
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
his
majesty
's
permission
to
step
over
this
wall
;
and
,
the
space
be
so
wide
between
that
and
the
palace
,
I
could
easily
view
it
on
every
side
.
<EOS>
the
outward
court
be
a
square
of
forty
foot
,
and
include
two
other
court
:
 
in
the
inmost
be
the
royal
apartment
,
which
I
be
very
desirous
to
see
,
but
find
it
extremely
difficult
;
for
the
great
gate
,
from
one
square
into
another
,
be
but
eighteen
inch
high
,
and
seven
inch
wide
.
 
<EOS>
now
the
building
of
the
outer
court
be
at
least
five
foot
high
,
and
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
stride
over
them
without
infinite
damage
to
the
pile
,
though
the
wall
be
strongly
build
of
hewn
stone
,
and
four
inch
thick
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
the
emperor
have
a
great
desire
that
I
should
see
the
magnificence
of
his
palace
;
but
this
I
be
not
able
to
do
till
three
day
after
,
which
I
spend
in
cut
down
with
my
knife
some
of
the
large
tree
in
the
royal
park
,
about
a
hundred
yard
distant
from
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
of
these
tree
I
make
two
stool
,
each
about
three
foot
high
,
and
strong
enough
to
bear
my
weight
.
 
<EOS>
the
people
have
receive
notice
a
second
time
,
I
go
again
through
the
city
to
the
palace
with
my
two
stool
in
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
the
side
of
the
outer
court
,
I
stand
upon
one
stool
,
and
take
the
other
in
my
hand
;
this
I
lift
over
the
roof
,
and
gently
set
it
down
on
the
space
between
the
first
and
second
court
,
which
be
eight
foot
wide
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
stept
over
the
building
very
conveniently
from
one
stool
to
the
other
,
and
draw
up
the
first
after
me
with
a
hooked
stick
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
contrivance
I
get
into
the
inmost
court
;
and
,
lie
down
upon
my
side
,
I
apply
my
face
to
the
window
of
the
middle
story
,
which
be
leave
open
on
purpose
,
and
discover
the
most
splendid
apartment
that
can
be
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
there
I
see
the
empress
and
the
young
prince
,
in
their
several
lodging
,
with
their
chief
attendant
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
Her
imperial
majesty
be
pleased
to
smile
very
graciously
upon
me
,
and
give
me
out
of
the
window
her
hand
to
kiss
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
shall
not
anticipate
the
reader
with
further
description
of
this
kind
,
because
I
reserve
them
for
a
great
work
,
which
be
now
almost
ready
for
the
press
;
contain
a
general
description
of
this
empire
,
from
its
first
erection
,
through
along
series
of
prince
;
with
a
particular
account
of
their
war
and
politic
,
law
,
learning
,
and
religion
;
their
plant
and
animal
;
their
peculiar
manner
and
custom
,
with
other
matter
very
curious
and
useful
;
my
chief
design
at
present
be
only
to
relate
such
event
and
transaction
as
happen
to
the
public
or
to
myself
during
a
residence
of
about
nine
month
in
that
empire
.
  
<EOS>
one
morning
,
about
a
fortnight
after
I
have
obtain
my
liberty
,
Reldresal
,
principal
secretary
(
as
they
style
him
)
for
private
affair
,
come
to
my
house
attend
only
by
one
servant
.
 
<EOS>
He
order
his
coach
to
wait
at
a
distance
,
and
desire
I
would
give
him
an
hour
audience
;
which
I
readily
consent
to
,
on
account
of
his
quality
and
personal
merit
,
as
well
as
of
the
many
good
office
he
have
do
me
during
my
solicitation
at
court
.
 
<EOS>
I
offer
to
lie
down
that
he
may
the
more
conveniently
reach
my
ear
,
but
he
choose
rather
to
let
me
hold
him
in
my
hand
during
our
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
He
begin
with
compliment
on
my
liberty
;
say
"
he
may
pretend
to
some
merit
in
it
;
"
but
,
however
,
add
,
"
that
if
it
have
not
be
for
the
present
situation
of
thing
at
court
,
perhaps
I
may
not
have
obtain
it
so
soon
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
as
flourish
a
condition
as
we
may
appear
to
be
in
to
foreigner
,
we
labour
under
two
mighty
evil
:
 
a
violent
faction
at
home
,
and
the
danger
of
an
invasion
,
by
a
most
potent
enemy
,
from
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
first
,
you
be
to
understand
,
that
for
about
seventy
moon
past
there
have
be
two
struggle
party
in
this
empire
,
under
the
name
of
Tramecksan
and
Slamecksan
,
from
the
high
and
low
heel
of
their
shoe
,
by
which
they
distinguish
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
allege
,
indeed
,
that
the
high
heel
be
most
agreeable
to
our
ancient
constitution
;
but
,
however
this
be
,
his
majesty
have
determine
to
make
use
only
of
low
heel
in
the
administration
of
the
government
,
and
all
office
in
the
gift
of
the
crown
,
as
you
can
not
but
observe
;
and
particularly
that
his
majesty
's
imperial
heel
be
low
at
least
by
a
drurr
than
any
of
his
court
<EOS>
(
drurr
be
a
measure
about
the
fourteenth
part
of
an
inch
)
.
 
<EOS>
the
animosity
between
these
two
party
run
so
high
,
that
they
will
neither
eat
,
nor
drink
,
nor
talk
with
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
We
compute
the
Tramecksan
,
or
high
heel
,
to
exceed
us
in
number
;
but
the
power
be
wholly
on
our
side
.
 
<EOS>
We
apprehend
his
imperial
highness
,
the
heir
to
the
crown
,
to
have
some
tendency
towards
the
high
heel
;
at
least
we
can
plainly
discover
that
one
of
his
heel
be
high
than
the
other
,
which
give
him
a
hobble
in
his
gait
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
in
the
midst
of
these
intestine
disquiet
,
we
be
threaten
with
an
invasion
from
the
island
of
Blefuscu
,
which
be
the
other
great
empire
of
the
universe
,
almost
as
large
and
powerful
as
this
of
his
majesty
.
 
<EOS>
for
as
to
what
we
have
hear
you
affirm
,
that
there
be
other
kingdom
and
state
in
the
world
inhabit
by
human
creature
as
large
as
yourself
,
our
philosopher
be
in
much
doubt
,
and
would
rather
conjecture
that
you
drop
from
the
moon
,
or
one
of
the
star
;
because
it
be
certain
,
that
a
hundred
mortal
of
your
bulk
would
in
a
short
time
destroy
all
the
fruit
and
cattle
of
his
majesty
's
dominion
:
 
besides
,
our
history
of
six
thousand
moon
make
no
mention
of
any
other
region
than
the
two
great
empire
of
Lilliput
and
Blefuscu
.
 
<EOS>
which
two
mighty
power
have
,
as
I
be
go
to
tell
you
,
be
engage
in
a
most
obstinate
war
for
six
-
and
-
thirty
moon
past
.
 
<EOS>
It
begin
upon
the
follow
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
allow
on
all
hand
,
that
the
primitive
way
of
break
egg
,
before
we
eat
them
,
be
upon
the
large
end
;
but
his
present
majesty
's
grandfather
,
while
he
be
a
boy
,
go
to
eat
an
egg
,
and
break
it
accord
to
the
ancient
practice
,
happen
to
cut
one
of
his
finger
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
the
emperor
his
father
publish
an
edict
,
command
all
his
subject
,
upon
great
penalty
,
to
break
the
small
end
of
their
egg
.
 
<EOS>
the
people
so
highly
resent
this
law
,
that
our
history
tell
us
,
there
have
be
six
rebellion
raise
on
that
account
;
wherein
one
emperor
lose
his
life
,
and
another
his
crown
.
<EOS>
these
civil
commotion
be
constantly
foment
by
the
monarchs
of
Blefuscu
;
and
when
they
be
quell
,
the
exile
always
flee
for
refuge
to
that
empire
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
compute
that
eleven
thousand
person
have
at
several
time
suffer
death
,
rather
than
submit
to
break
their
egg
at
the
small
end
.
 
<EOS>
many
hundred
large
volume
have
be
publish
upon
this
controversy
:
 
but
the
book
of
the
Big
-
endian
have
be
long
forbid
,
and
the
whole
party
render
incapable
by
law
of
hold
employment
.
 
<EOS>
during
the
course
of
these
trouble
,
the
emperor
of
Blefusca
do
frequently
expostulate
by
their
ambassador
,
accuse
us
of
make
a
schism
in
religion
,
by
offend
against
a
fundamental
doctrine
of
our
great
prophet
Lustrog
,
in
the
fifty
-
fourth
chapter
of
the
Blundecral
(
which
be
their
Alcoran
)
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
think
to
be
a
mere
strain
upon
the
text
;
for
the
word
be
these
:
 
"
that
all
true
believer
break
their
egg
at
the
convenient
end
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
which
be
the
convenient
end
,
seem
,
in
my
humble
opinion
to
be
leave
to
every
man
's
conscience
,
or
at
least
in
the
power
of
the
chief
magistrate
to
determine
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
the
big
-
endian
exile
have
find
so
much
credit
in
the
emperor
of
Blefuscu
's
court
,
and
so
much
private
assistance
and
encouragement
from
their
party
here
at
home
,
that
a
bloody
war
have
be
carry
on
between
the
two
empire
for
six
-
and
-
thirty
moon
,
with
various
success
;
during
which
time
we
have
lose
forty
capital
ship
,
and
a
much
a
great
number
of
small
vessel
,
together
with
thirty
thousand
of
our
good
seaman
and
soldier
;
and
the
damage
receive
by
the
enemy
be
reckon
to
be
somewhat
great
than
ours
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
they
have
now
equip
a
numerous
fleet
,
and
be
just
prepare
to
make
a
descent
upon
us
;
and
his
imperial
majesty
,
place
great
confidence
in
your
valour
and
strength
,
have
command
me
to
lay
this
account
of
his
affair
before
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
desire
the
secretary
to
present
my
humble
duty
to
the
emperor
;
and
to
let
him
know
,
"
that
I
think
it
would
not
become
me
,
who
be
a
foreigner
,
to
interfere
with
party
;
but
I
be
ready
,
with
the
hazard
of
my
life
,
to
defend
his
person
and
state
against
all
invader
.
"
   
<EOS>

by
an
extraordinary

,
prevent

of

the

by

;
the

in

<EOS>
the
empire
of
Blefuscu
be
an
island
situate
to
the
north
-
east
of
Lilliput
,
from
which
it
be
part
only
by
a
channel
of
eight
hundred
yard
wide
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
see
it
,
and
upon
this
notice
of
an
intended
invasion
,
I
avoid
appear
on
that
side
of
the
coast
,
for
fear
of
be
discover
,
by
some
of
the
enemy
's
ship
,
who
have
receive
no
intelligence
of
me
;
all
intercourse
between
the
two
empire
have
be
strictly
forbid
during
the
war
,
upon
pain
of
death
,
and
an
embargo
lay
by
our
emperor
upon
all
vessel
whatsoever
.
 
<EOS>
I
communicate
to
his
majesty
a
project
I
have
form
of
seize
the
enemy
's
whole
fleet
;
which
,
as
our
scout
assure
us
,
lie
at
anchor
in
the
harbour
,
ready
to
sail
with
the
first
fair
wind
.
 
<EOS>
I
consult
the
most
experienced
seaman
upon
the
depth
of
the
channel
,
which
they
have
often
plumb
;
who
tell
me
,
that
in
the
middle
,
at
high
-
water
,
it
be
seventy
glumgluff
deep
,
which
be
about
six
foot
of
european
measure
;
and
the
rest
of
it
fifty
glumgluff
at
most
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
towards
the
north
-
east
coast
,
over
against
Blefuscu
,
<EOS>
where
,
lie
down
behind
a
hillock
,
I
take
out
my
small
perspective
glass
,
and
view
the
enemy
's
fleet
at
anchor
,
consist
of
about
fifty
man
of
war
,
and
a
great
number
of
transport
:
 
<EOS>
I
then
come
back
to
my
house
,
and
give
order
(
for
which
I
have
a
warrant
)
for
a
great
quantity
of
the
strong
cable
and
bar
of
iron
.
 
<EOS>
the
cable
be
about
as
thick
as
packthread
and
the
bar
of
the
length
and
size
of
a
knitting
-
needle
.
 
<EOS>
I
treble
the
cable
to
make
it
strong
,
and
for
the
same
reason
I
twist
three
of
the
iron
bar
together
,
bend
the
extremity
into
a
hook
.
 
<EOS>
have
thus
fix
fifty
hook
to
as
many
cable
,
I
go
back
to
the
north
-
east
coast
,
and
put
off
my
coat
,
shoe
,
and
stocking
,
walk
into
the
sea
,
in
my
leathern
jerkin
,
about
half
an
hour
before
high
water
.
 
<EOS>
I
wade
with
what
haste
I
could
,
and
swam
in
the
middle
about
thirty
yard
,
till
I
feel
ground
.
 
<EOS>
I
arrive
at
the
fleet
in
less
than
half
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
the
enemy
be
so
frightened
<EOS>
when
they
see
me
,
that
they
leap
out
of
their
ship
,
and
swam
to
shore
,
where
there
could
not
be
few
than
thirty
thousand
soul
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
take
my
tackling
,
and
,
fasten
a
hook
to
the
hole
at
the
prow
of
each
<EOS>
,
I
tie
all
the
cord
together
at
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
while
I
be
thus
employ
,
the
enemy
discharge
several
thousand
arrow
,
many
of
which
stick
in
my
hand
and
face
,
and
,
beside
the
excessive
smart
,
give
me
much
disturbance
in
my
work
.
<EOS>
My
great
apprehension
be
for
mine
eye
,
which
I
should
have
infallibly
lose
,
if
I
have
not
suddenly
think
of
an
expedient
.
 
<EOS>
I
keep
,
among
other
little
necessary
,
a
pair
of
spectacle
in
a
private
pocket
,
which
,
as
I
observe
before
,
have
escape
the
emperor
's
searcher
.
 
<EOS>
these
I
take
out
and
fasten
as
strongly
as
I
could
upon
my
nose
,
and
thus
armed
,
go
on
boldly
with
my
work
,
in
spite
of
the
enemy
's
arrow
,
many
of
which
strike
against
the
glass
of
my
spectacle
,
but
without
any
other
effect
,
further
than
a
little
to
discompose
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
now
fasten
all
the
hook
,
and
,
take
the
knot
in
my
hand
,
begin
to
pull
;
but
not
a
ship
would
stir
,
for
they
be
all
too
fast
hold
by
their
anchor
,
so
that
the
bold
part
of
my
enterprise
remain
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
let
go
the
cord
,
and
leave
the
look
fix
to
the
ship
,
I
resolutely
cut
with
my
knife
the
cable
that
fasten
the
anchor
,
receive
about
two
hundred
shot
in
my
face
and
hand
;
then
I
take
up
the
knotted
end
of
the
cable
,
to
which
my
hook
be
tie
,
and
with
great
ease
draw
fifty
of
the
enemy
's
large
man
of
war
after
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
Blefuscudians
,
who
have
not
the
least
imagination
of
what
I
intend
,
be
at
first
confound
with
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
see
me
cut
the
cable
,
and
think
my
design
be
only
to
let
the
ship
run
adrift
or
fall
foul
on
each
other
:
 
<EOS>
but
when
they
perceive
the
whole
fleet
move
in
order
,
and
see
me
pull
at
the
end
,
they
set
up
such
a
scream
of
grief
and
despair
as
it
be
almost
impossible
to
describe
or
conceive
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
get
out
of
danger
,
I
stop
awhile
to
pick
out
the
arrow
that
stick
in
my
hand
and
face
;
and
rub
on
some
of
the
same
ointment
that
be
give
me
at
my
first
arrival
,
as
I
have
formerly
mention
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
take
off
my
spectacle
,
and
wait
about
an
hour
,
till
the
tide
be
a
little
fallen
,
I
wade
through
the
middle
with
my
cargo
,
and
arrive
safe
at
the
royal
port
of
Lilliput
.
  
<EOS>
the
emperor
and
his
whole
court
stand
on
the
shore
,
expect
the
issue
of
this
great
adventure
.
 
<EOS>
They
see
the
ship
move
forward
in
a
large
half
-
moon
,
but
could
not
discern
me
,
who
be
up
to
my
breast
in
water
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
advance
to
the
middle
of
the
channel
,
they
be
yet
more
in
pain
,
because
I
be
under
water
to
my
neck
.
<EOS>
the
emperor
conclude
me
to
be
drown
,
and
that
the
enemy
's
fleet
be
approach
in
a
hostile
manner
:
 
but
he
be
soon
ease
of
his
fear
;
for
the
channel
grow
shallower
every
step
I
make
,
I
come
in
a
short
time
within
hearing
,
and
hold
up
the
end
of
the
cable
,
by
which
the
fleet
be
fasten
,
I
cry
in
a
loud
voice
,
"
long
live
the
most
puissant
king
of
Lilliput
!
"
 
<EOS>
this
great
prince
receive
me
at
my
landing
with
all
possible
encomium
,
and
create
me
a
nardac
upon
the
spot
,
which
be
the
high
title
of
honour
among
them
.
  
<EOS>
His
majesty
desire
I
would
take
some
other
opportunity
of
bring
all
the
rest
of
his
enemy
's
ship
into
his
port
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
unmeasureable
be
the
ambition
of
prince
,
that
he
seem
to
think
of
nothing
less
than
reduce
the
whole
empire
of
Blefuscu
into
a
province
,
and
govern
it
,
by
a
viceroy
;
of
destroy
the
big
-
endian
exile
,
and
compelling
that
people
to
break
the
small
end
of
their
egg
,
by
which
he
would
remain
the
sole
monarch
of
the
whole
world
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
endeavour
to
divert
him
from
this
design
,
by
many
argument
draw
from
the
topic
of
policy
as
well
as
justice
;
and
I
plainly
protest
,
"
that
I
would
never
be
an
instrument
of
bring
a
free
and
brave
people
into
slavery
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
,
when
the
matter
be
debate
in
council
,
the
wise
part
of
the
ministry
be
of
my
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
this
open
bold
declaration
of
mine
be
so
opposite
to
the
scheme
and
politic
of
his
imperial
majesty
,
that
he
could
never
forgive
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
mention
it
in
a
very
artful
manner
at
council
,
where
I
be
tell
that
some
of
the
wise
appear
,
at
least
by
their
silence
,
to
be
of
my
opinion
;
but
other
,
who
be
my
secret
enemy
,
could
not
forbear
some
expression
which
,
by
a
side
-
wind
,
reflect
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
from
this
time
begin
an
intrigue
between
his
majesty
and
a
junto
of
minister
,
maliciously
bent
against
me
,
which
break
out
in
less
than
two
month
,
and
have
like
to
have
end
in
my
utter
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
of
<EOS>
so
little
weight
be
the
great
service
to
prince
,
when
put
into
the
balance
with
a
refusal
to
gratify
their
passion
.
  
<EOS>
about
three
week
after
this
exploit
,
there
arrive
a
solemn
embassy
from
Blefuscu
,
with
humble
offer
of
a
peace
,
which
be
soon
conclude
,
upon
condition
very
advantageous
to
our
emperor
,
wherewith
<EOS>
I
shall
not
trouble
the
reader
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
six
ambassador
,
with
a
train
of
about
five
hundred
person
,
and
their
entry
be
very
magnificent
,
suitable
to
the
grandeur
of
their
master
,
and
the
importance
of
their
business
.
 
<EOS>
when
their
treaty
be
finish
,
wherein
I
do
them
several
good
office
by
the
credit
I
now
have
,
or
at
least
appear
to
have
,
at
court
,
their
excellency
,
who
be
privately
tell
how
much
I
have
be
their
friend
,
make
me
a
visit
in
form
.
 
<EOS>
They
begin
with
many
compliment
upon
my
valour
and
generosity
,
invite
me
to
that
kingdom
in
the
emperor
their
master
's
name
,
and
desire
me
to
show
them
some
proof
of
my
prodigious
strength
,
of
which
they
have
hear
so
many
wonder
;
wherein
I
readily
oblige
them
,
but
shall
not
trouble
the
reader
with
the
particular
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
have
for
some
time
entertain
their
excellency
,
to
their
infinite
satisfaction
and
surprise
,
I
desire
they
would
do
me
the
honour
to
present
my
most
humble
respect
to
the
emperor
their
master
,
the
renown
of
whose
virtue
have
so
justly
fill
the
whole
world
with
admiration
,
and
whose
royal
person
I
resolve
to
attend
,
before
I
return
to
my
own
country
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
the
next
time
I
have
the
honour
to
see
our
emperor
<EOS>
,
I
desire
his
general
license
to
wait
on
the
blefuscudian
monarch
,
which
he
be
pleased
to
grant
me
,
as
I
could
perceive
,
in
a
very
cold
manner
;
but
could
not
guess
the
reason
,
till
I
have
a
whisper
from
a
certain
person
,
"
that
Flimnap
and
Bolgolam
have
represent
my
intercourse
with
those
ambassador
as
a
mark
of
disaffection
;
"
from
which
I
be
sure
my
heart
be
wholly
free
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
be
the
first
time
I
begin
to
conceive
some
imperfect
idea
of
court
and
minister
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
observe
,
that
these
ambassador
speak
to
me
,
by
an
interpreter
,
the
language
of
both
empire
differ
as
much
from
each
other
as
any
two
in
Europe
,
and
each
nation
pride
itself
upon
the
antiquity
,
beauty
,
and
energy
of
their
own
tongue
,
with
an
avow
contempt
for
that
of
their
neighbour
;
yet
our
emperor
,
stand
upon
the
advantage
he
have
get
by
the
seizure
of
their
fleet
,
oblige
them
to
deliver
their
credential
,
and
make
their
speech
,
in
the
lilliputian
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
must
be
confess
,
that
from
the
great
intercourse
of
trade
and
commerce
between
both
realm
,
from
the
continual
reception
of
exile
which
be
mutual
among
them
,
and
from
the
custom
,
in
each
empire
,
to
send
their
young
nobility
and
rich
gentry
to
the
other
,
in
order
to
polish
themselves
by
see
the
world
,
and
understand
man
and
manner
;
there
be
few
person
of
distinction
,
or
merchant
,
or
seaman
,
who
dwell
in
the
maritime
part
,
but
what
can
hold
conversation
in
both
tongue
;
as
I
find
some
week
after
,
when
I
go
to
pay
my
respect
to
the
emperor
of
Blefuscu
,
which
,
in
the
midst
of
great
misfortune
,
through
the
malice
of
my
enemy
,
prove
a
very
happy
adventure
to
me
,
as
I
shall
relate
in
its
proper
place
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
may
remember
,
that
when
I
sign
those
article
upon
which
I
recover
my
liberty
,
there
be
some
which
I
dislike
,
upon
account
of
their
be
too
servile
;
neither
could
anything
but
an
extreme
necessity
have
force
me
to
submit
.
 
<EOS>
but
be
now
a
nardac
of
the
high
rank
in
that
empire
,
such
office
be
look
upon
as
below
my
dignity
,
and
the
emperor
(
to
do
him
justice
)
,
never
once
mention
them
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
not
long
before
I
have
an
opportunity
of
do
his
majesty
,
at
least
as
I
then
think
,
a
most
signal
service
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
alarm
at
midnight
with
the
cry
of
many
hundred
people
at
my
door
;
by
which
,
be
suddenly
awake
,
I
be
in
some
kind
of
terror
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
the
word
Burglum
repeat
incessantly
:
 
several
of
the
emperor
's
court
,
make
their
way
through
the
crowd
,
entreat
me
to
come
immediately
to
the
palace
,
where
her
imperial
majesty
's
apartment
be
on
fire
,
by
the
carelessness
of
a
maid
of
honour
,
who
fall
asleep
while
she
be
read
a
romance
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
up
in
an
instant
;
and
order
be
give
to
clear
the
way
before
me
,
and
it
be
likewise
a
moonshine
night
<EOS>
,
I
make
a
shift
to
get
to
the
palace
without
trample
on
any
of
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
they
have
already
apply
ladder
to
the
wall
of
the
apartment
,
and
be
well
provide
with
bucket
,
but
the
water
be
at
some
distance
.
 
<EOS>
these
bucket
be
about
the
size
of
large
thimble
,
and
the
poor
people
supply
me
with
them
as
fast
as
they
could
:
 
but
the
flame
be
so
violent
that
they
do
little
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
easily
have
stifle
it
with
my
coat
,
which
I
unfortunately
leave
behind
me
for
haste
,
and
come
away
only
in
my
leathern
jerkin
.
 
<EOS>
the
case
seem
wholly
desperate
and
deplorable
;
and
this
magnificent
palace
would
have
infallibly
be
burn
down
to
the
ground
,
if
,
by
a
presence
of
mind
unusual
to
me
,
I
have
not
suddenly
think
of
an
expedient
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
,
the
evening
before
,
drunk
plentifully
of
a
most
delicious
wine
call
glimigrim
,
(
the
Blefuscudians
call
it
flunec
,
but
ours
be
esteem
the
well
sort
,
)
which
be
very
diuretic
.
 
<EOS>
by
the
lucky
chance
in
the
world
,
I
have
not
discharge
myself
of
any
part
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
heat
I
have
contract
by
come
very
near
the
flame
,
and
by
labour
to
quench
them
,
make
the
wine
begin
to
operate
by
urine
;
which
I
void
in
such
a
quantity
,
and
apply
so
well
to
the
proper
place
,
that
in
three
minute
the
fire
be
wholly
extinguish
,
and
the
rest
of
that
noble
pile
,
which
have
cost
so
many
age
in
erect
,
preserve
from
destruction
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
day
-
light
,
and
I
return
to
my
house
without
wait
to
congratulate
with
the
emperor
:
 
because
,
although
I
have
do
a
very
eminent
piece
of
service
,
yet
I
could
not
tell
how
his
majesty
may
resent
the
manner
by
which
I
have
perform
it
:
 
for
,
by
the
fundamental
law
of
the
realm
,
it
be
capital
in
any
person
,
of
what
quality
soever
,
to
make
water
within
the
precinct
of
the
palace
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
a
little
comfort
by
a
message
from
his
majesty
,
"
that
he
would
give
order
to
the
grand
justiciary
for
pass
my
pardon
in
form
:
"
which
,
however
,
I
could
not
obtain
;
and
I
be
privately
assure
,
"
that
the
empress
,
conceive
the
great
abhorrence
of
what
I
have
do
,
remove
to
the
most
distant
side
of
the
court
,
firmly
resolve
that
those
building
should
never
be
repair
for
her
use
:
 
and
,
in
the
presence
of
her
chief
confident
could
not
forbear
vow
revenge
.
"
   
<EOS>
of
the
inhabitant
of
Lilliput
;
their
learning
,
law
,
and
custom
;
the
manner
of
educate
their
child
.
 
<EOS>
the
author
's
way
of
live
in
that
country
.
 
<EOS>
His
vindication
of
a
great
lady
.
 
<EOS>
although
I
intend
to
leave
the
description
of
this
empire
to
a
particular
treatise
,
yet
,
in
the
mean
time
,
I
be
content
to
gratify
the
curious
reader
with
some
general
idea
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
common
size
of
the
native
be
somewhat
under
six
inch
high
,
so
there
be
an
exact
proportion
in
all
other
animal
,
as
well
as
plant
and
tree
:
 
<EOS>
for
instance
,
the
tall
horse
and
oxen
be
between
four
and
five
inch
in
height
,
the
sheep
an
inch
and
half
,
more
or
less
:
 
their
goose
about
the
bigness
of
a
sparrow
,
and
so
the
several
gradation
downward
<EOS>
till
you
come
to
the
small
,
which
to
my
sight
,
be
almost
invisible
;
but
nature
have
adapt
the
eye
of
the
Lilliputians
to
all
object
proper
for
their
view
:
 
they
see
with
great
exactness
,
but
at
no
great
distance
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
to
show
the
sharpness
of
their
sight
towards
object
that
be
near
,
I
have
be
much
pleased
with
observe
a
cook
pull
a
lark
,
which
be
not
so
large
as
a
common
fly
;
and
a
young
girl
thread
an
invisible
needle
with
invisible
silk
.
 
<EOS>
Their
tall
tree
be
about
seven
foot
high
:
 
<EOS>
I
mean
some
of
those
in
the
great
royal
park
,
<EOS>
the
top
whereof
I
could
but
just
reach
with
my
fist
clench
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
vegetable
be
in
the
same
proportion
;
but
this
I
leave
to
the
reader
's
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
say
<EOS>
but
little
at
present
of
their
learning
,
which
,
for
many
age
,
have
flourish
in
all
its
branch
among
them
:
 
but
their
manner
of
writing
be
very
peculiar
,
be
neither
from
the
left
to
the
right
,
like
the
Europeans
,
nor
from
the
right
to
the
left
,
like
the
Arabians
,
nor
from
up
to
down
,
like
the
Chinese
,
but
aslant
,
from
one
corner
of
the
paper
to
the
other
,
like
lady
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
They
bury
their
dead
with
their
head
directly
downward
,
because
they
hold
an
opinion
,
that
in
eleven
thousand
moon
they
be
all
to
rise
again
;
in
which
period
the
earth
(
which
they
conceive
to
be
flat
)
will
turn
upside
down
,
and
by
this
mean
they
shall
,
at
their
resurrection
,
be
find
ready
stand
on
their
foot
.
 
<EOS>
the
learn
among
them
confess
the
absurdity
of
this
doctrine
;
but
the
practice
still
continue
,
in
compliance
to
the
vulgar
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
some
law
and
custom
in
this
empire
very
peculiar
;
and
if
they
be
not
so
directly
contrary
to
those
of
my
own
dear
country
,
I
should
be
tempt
to
say
a
little
in
their
justification
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
to
be
wish
they
be
as
well
execute
.
<EOS>
the
first
I
shall
mention
,
relate
to
informer
.
 
<EOS>
all
crime
against
the
state
,
be
punish
here
with
the
utmost
severity
;
but
,
if
the
person
accuse
make
his
innocence
plainly
to
appear
upon
his
trial
,
the
accuser
be
immediately
put
to
an
ignominious
death
;
and
out
of
his
good
or
land
the
innocent
person
be
quadruply
recompense
for
the
loss
of
his
time
,
for
the
danger
he
undergo
,
for
the
hardship
of
his
imprisonment
,
and
for
all
the
charge
he
have
be
at
in
make
his
defence
;
or
,
if
that
fund
be
deficient
,
it
be
largely
supply
by
the
crown
.
 
<EOS>
the
emperor
also
confer
on
him
some
public
mark
of
his
favour
,
and
proclamation
be
make
of
his
innocence
through
the
whole
city
.
  
<EOS>
They
look
upon
fraud
as
a
great
crime
than
theft
,
and
therefore
seldom
fail
to
punish
it
with
death
;
<EOS>
for
they
allege
,
that
care
and
vigilance
,
with
a
very
common
understanding
,
may
preserve
a
man
's
good
from
thief
,
but
honesty
have
no
defence
against
superior
cunning
;
and
,
since
it
be
necessary
that
there
should
be
a
perpetual
intercourse
of
buy
and
selling
,
and
deal
upon
credit
,
where
fraud
be
permit
and
connive
at
,
or
have
no
law
to
punish
it
,
the
honest
dealer
be
always
undone
,
and
the
knave
get
the
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
,
when
I
be
once
intercede
with
the
emperor
for
a
criminal
who
have
wrong
his
master
of
a
great
sum
of
money
,
which
he
have
receive
by
order
and
run
away
with
;
and
happen
to
tell
his
majesty
,
by
way
of
extenuation
,
that
it
be
only
a
breach
of
trust
,
the
emperor
think
it
monstrous
in
me
to
offer
as
a
defence
the
great
aggravation
of
the
crime
;
and
truly
I
have
little
to
say
in
return
,
farther
than
the
common
answer
,
that
different
nation
have
different
custom
;
for
,
I
confess
,
I
be
heartily
ashamed
.
{

although
we
usually
call
reward
and
punishment
the
two
hinge
upon
which
all
government
turn
,
yet
I
could
never
observe
this
maxim
to
be
put
in
practice
by
any
nation
except
that
of
Lilliput
.
 
<EOS>
whoever
can
there
bring
sufficient
proof
,
that
he
have
strictly
observe
the
law
of
his
country
for
seventy

have
a
claim

of

that

he
likewise
acquire
the

or
legal

which
be
add

his

but
do
not

<EOS>
and
these
people
think
it
a
prodigious
defect
of
policy
among
us
,
when
I
tell
them
that
our
law
be
enforce
only
by
penalty
,
without
any
mention
of
reward
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
upon
this
account
that
the
image
of
Justice
,
in
their
court
of
judicature
,
be
form
with
six
eye
,
two
before
,
as
many
behind
,
and
on
each
side
one
,
to
signify
circumspection
;
with
a
bag
of
gold
open
in
her
right
hand
,
and
a
sword
sheathe
in
her
left
,
to
show
she
be
more
disposed
to
reward
than
to
punish
.
  
<EOS>
in
choose
person
for
all
employment
,
they
have
more
regard
to
good
moral
than
to
great
ability
;
for
,
since
government
be
necessary
to
mankind
,
they
believe
,
that
the
common
size
of
human
understanding
be
fit
to
some
station
or
other
;
and
that
Providence
never
intend
to
make
the
management
of
public
affair
a
mystery
to
be
comprehend
only
by
a
few
person
of
sublime
genius
,
of
which
there
seldom
be
three
bear
in
an
age
:
 
but
they
suppose
truth
,
justice
,
temperance
,
and
the
like
,
to
be
in
every
man
's
power
;
the
practice
of
which
virtue
,
assist
by
experience
and
a
good
intention
,
would
qualify
any
man
for
the
service
of
his
country
,
except
where
a
course
of
study
be
require
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
think
the
want
of
moral
virtue
be
so
far
from
be
supply
by
superior
endowment
of
the
mind
,
that
employment
could
never
be
put
into
such
dangerous
hand
as
those
of
person
so
qualified
;
and
,
at
least
,
that
the
mistake
commit
by
ignorance
,
in
a
virtuous
disposition
,
would
never
be
of
such
fatal
consequence
to
the
public
weal
,
as
the
practice
of
a
man
,
whose
inclination
lead
him
to
be
corrupt
,
and
who
have
great
ability
to
manage
,
to
multiply
,
and
defend
his
corruption
.
  
<EOS>
in
like
manner
,
the
disbelief
of
a
Divine
Providence
render
a
man
incapable
of
hold
any
public
station
;
for
,
since
king
avow
themselves
to
be
the
deputy
of
Providence
,
the
Lilliputians
think
nothing
can
be
more
absurd
than
for
a
prince
to
employ
such
man
as
disown
the
authority
under
which
he
act
.
  
<EOS>
in
relate
these
and
the
follow
law
,
I
would
only
be
understand
to
mean
the
original
institution
,
and
not
the
most
scandalous
corruption
,
into
which
these
people
be
fall
by
the
degenerate
nature
of
man
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
as
to
that
infamous
practice
of
acquire
great
employment
by
dance
on
the
rope
,
or
badge
of
favour
and
distinction
by
leap
over
stick
and
creep
under
them
,
the
reader
be
to
observe
,
that
they
be
first
introduce
by
the
grandfather
of
the
emperor
now
reign
,
and
grow
to
the
present
height
by
the
gradual
increase
of
party
and
faction
.
  
<EOS>
ingratitude
be
among
them
a
capital
crime
,
as
we
read
it
to
have
be
in
some
other
country
:
 
<EOS>
for
they
reason
thus
;
that
whoever
make
ill
return
to
his
benefactor
,
must
need
be
a
common
enemy
to
the
rest
of
mankind
,
from
whom
he
have
receive
no
obligation
,
and
therefore
such
a
man
be
not
fit
to
live
.
  
<EOS>
Their
notion
relate
to
the
duty
of
parent
and
child
differ
extremely
from
our
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
since
the
conjunction
of
male
and
female
be
found
upon
the
great
law
of
nature
,
in
order
to
propagate
and
continue
the
specie
,
the
Lilliputians
will
needs
have
it
,
that
man
and
woman
be
join
together
,
like
other
animal
,
by
the
motive
of
concupiscence
;
and
that
their
tenderness
towards
their
young
proceed
from
the
like
natural
principle
:
 
for
which
reason
they
will
never
allow
that
a
child
be
under
any
obligation
to
his
father
for
beget
him
,
or
to
his
mother
for
bring
him
into
the
world
;
which
,
consider
the
misery
of
human
life
,
be
neither
a
benefit
in
itself
,
nor
intend
so
by
his
parent
,
whose
thought
,
in
their
love
encounter
,
be
otherwise
employ
.
 
<EOS>
upon
these
,
and
the
like
reasoning
,
their
opinion
be
,
that
parent
be
the
last
of
all
other
to
be
trust
with
the
education
of
their
own
child
;
and
therefore
they
have
in
every
town
public
nursery
,
where
all
parent
,
except
cottager
and
labourer
,
be
oblige
to
send
their
infant
of
both
sex
to
be
rear
and
educate
,
when
they
come
to
the
age
of
twenty
moon
,
at
which
time
they
be
suppose
to
have
some
rudiment
of
docility
.
 
<EOS>
these
school
be
of
several
kind
,
suit
to
different
quality
,
and
both
sex
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
certain
professor
well
skilled
in
prepare
child
for
such
a
condition
of
life
as
befit
the
rank
of
their
parent
,
and
their
own
capacity
,
as
well
as
inclination
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
first
say
something
of
the
male
nursery
,
and
then
of
the
female
.
  
<EOS>
the
nursery
for
male
of
noble
or
eminent
birth
,
be
provide
with
grave
and
learned
professor
,
and
their
several
deputy
.
 
<EOS>
the
clothe
and
food
of
the
child
be
plain
and
simple
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
breed
up
in
the
principle
of
honour
,
justice
,
courage
,
modesty
,
clemency
,
religion
,
and
love
of
their
country
;
they
be
always
employ
in
some
business
,
except
in
the
time
of
eat
and
sleep
,
which
be
very
short
,
and
two
hour
for
diversion
consist
of
bodily
exercise
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
dress
by
man
till
four
year
of
age
,
and
then
be
oblige
to
dress
themselves
,
although
their
quality
be
ever
so
great
;
and
the
woman
attendant
,
who
be
aged
proportionably
to
ours
at
fifty
,
perform
only
the
most
menial
office
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
never
suffer
to
converse
with
servant
,
but
go
together
in
small
or
great
number
to
take
their
diversion
,
and
always
in
the
presence
of
a
professor
,
or
one
of
his
deputy
;
whereby
they
avoid
those
early
bad
impression
of
folly
and
vice
,
to
which
our
child
be
subject
.
 
<EOS>
Their
parent
be
suffer
to
see
them
only
twice
a
year
;
the
visit
be
to
last
but
an
hour
;
they
be
allow
to
kiss
the
child
at
meeting
and
parting
;
but
a
professor
,
who
always
stand
by
on
those
occasion
,
will
not
suffer
them
to
whisper
,
or
use
any
fondle
expression
,
or
bring
any
present
of
toy
,
sweetmeat
,
and
the
like
.
  
<EOS>
the
pension
from
each
family
for
the
education
and
entertainment
of
a
child
,
upon
failure
of
due
payment
,
be
levy
by
the
emperor
's
officer
.
  
<EOS>
the
nursery
for
child
of
ordinary
gentleman
,
merchant
,
trader
,
and
handicraft
,
be
manage
proportionably
after
the
same
manner
;
only
those
design
for
trade
be
put
out
apprentice
at
eleven
year
old
,
whereas
those
of
person
of
quality
continue
in
their
exercise
till
fifteen
,
which
answer
to
twenty
-
one
with
us
:
but
the
confinement
be
gradually
lessen
for
the
last
three
year
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
female
nursery
,
the
young
girl
of
quality
be
educate
much
like
the
male
,
only
they
be
dress
by
orderly
servant
of
their
own
sex
;
but
always
in
the
presence
of
a
professor
or
deputy
,
till
they
come
to
dress
themselves
,
which
be
at
five
year
old
.
<EOS>
and
if
it
be
find
that
these
nurse
ever
presume
to
entertain
the
girl
with
frightful
or
foolish
story
,
or
the
common
folly
practise
by
chambermaid
among
us
,
they
be
publicly
whip
thrice
about
the
city
,
imprison
for
a
year
,
and
banish
for
life
to
the
most
desolate
part
of
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
thus
the
young
lady
be
as
much
ashamed
of
be
coward
and
fool
as
the
man
,
and
despise
all
personal
ornament
,
beyond
decency
and
cleanliness
:
<EOS>
neither
do
I
perceive
any
difference
in
their
education
make
by
their
difference
of
sex
,
only
that
the
exercise
of
the
female
be
not
altogether
so
robust
;
and
that
some
rule
be
give
them
relate
to
domestic
life
,
and
a
small
compass
of
learning
be
enjoin
them
:
 
for
their
maxim
<EOS>
be
,
that
among
people
of
quality
,
a
wife
should
be
always
a
reasonable
and
agreeable
companion
,
because
she
can
not
always
be
young
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
girl
be
twelve
year
old
,
which
among
them
be
the
marriageable
age
,
their
parent
or
guardian
take
them
home
,
with
great
expression
of
gratitude
to
the
professor
,
and
seldom
without
tear
of
the
young
lady
and
her
companion
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
nursery
of
female
of
the
meaner
sort
,
the
child
be
instruct
in
all
kind
of
work
proper
for
their
sex
,
and
their
several
degree
:
 
those
intend
for
apprentice
be
dismiss
at
seven
year
old
,
the
rest
be
keep
to
eleven
.
  
<EOS>
the
mean
family
who
have
child
at
these
nursery
,
be
oblige
,
besides
their
annual
pension
,
which
be
as
low
as
possible
,
to
return
to
the
steward
of
the
nursery
a
small
monthly
share
of
their
getting
,
to
be
a
portion
for
the
child
;
and
therefore
all
parent
be
limit
in
their
expense
by
the
law
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
Lilliputians
think
nothing
can
be
more
unjust
,
than
for
people
,
in
subservience
to
their
own
appetite
,
to
bring
child
into
the
world
,
and
leave
the
burthen
of
support
them
on
the
public
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
person
of
quality
,
they
give
security
to
appropriate
a
certain
sum
for
each
child
,
suitable
to
their
condition
;
and
these
fund
be
always
manage
with
good
husbandry
and
the
most
exact
justice
.
  
<EOS>
the
cottager
and
labourer
keep
their
child
at
home
,
their
business
be
only
to
till
and
cultivate
the
earth
,
and
therefore
their
education
be
of
little
consequence
to
the
public
:
 
but
the
old
and
disease
among
them
,
be
support
by
hospital
;
for
begging
be
a
trade
unknown
in
this
empire
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
it
may
,
perhaps
,
divert
the
curious
reader
,
to
give
some
account
of
my
domestic
,
and
my
manner
of
live
in
this
country
,
during
a
residence
of
nine
month
,
and
thirteen
day
.
 
<EOS>
have
a
head
mechanically
turn
,
and
be
likewise
force
by
necessity
,
I
have
make
for
myself
a
table
and
chair
convenient
enough
,
out
of
the
large
tree
in
the
royal
park
.
 
<EOS>
two
hundred
sempstress
be
employ
to
make
me
shirt
,
and
linen
for
my
bed
and
table
,
all
of
the
strong
and
coarse
kind
they
could
get
;
which
,
however
,
they
be
force
to
quilt
together
in
several
fold
,
for
the
thick
<EOS>
be
some
degree
fine
than
lawn
.
 
<EOS>
Their
linen
be
usually
three
inch
wide
,
and
three
foot
make
a
piece
.
 
<EOS>
the
sempstress
take
my
measure
as
I
lie
on
the
ground
,
one
stand
at
my
neck
,
and
another
at
my
mid
-
leg
,
with
a
strong
cord
extend
,
<EOS>
that
each
hold
by
the
end
,
while
a
third
measure
the
length
of
the
cord
with
a
rule
of
an
inch
long
.
 
<EOS>
then
they
measure
my
right
thumb
,
and
desire
no
more
;
for
by
a
mathematical
computation
,
that
twice
round
the
thumb
be
once
round
the
wrist
,
and
<EOS>
so
on
to
the
neck
and
the
waist
,
and
by
the
help
of
my
old
shirt
,
which
I
display
on
the
ground
before
them
for
a
pattern
,
they
fit
me
exactly
.
<EOS>
three
hundred
tailor
be
employ
in
the
same
manner
to
make
me
clothe
;
but
they
have
another
contrivance
for
take
my
measure
.
 
<EOS>
I
kneel
down
,
and
they
raise
a
ladder
from
the
ground
to
my
neck
;
upon
this
ladder
one
of
them
mount
,
and
let
fall
a
plumb
-
line
from
my
collar
to
the
floor
,
which
just
answer
the
length
of
my
coat
:
 
but
my
waist
and
arm
<EOS>
I
measure
myself
.
 
<EOS>
when
my
clothe
be
finish
,
which
be
do
in
my
house
(
for
the
large
of
theirs
would
not
have
be
able
to
hold
them
)
,
they
look
like
the
patch
-
work
make
by
the
lady
in
England
,
only
that
mine
be
all
of
a
colour
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
three
hundred
cook
to
dress
my
victual
,
in
little
convenient
hut
build
about
my
house
,
where
they
and
their
family
live
,
and
prepare
me
two
dish
a
-
piece
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
up
twenty
waiter
in
my
hand
,
and
place
them
on
the
table
:
 
a
hundred
more
attend
below
on
the
ground
,
some
with
dish
of
meat
,
and
some
with
barrel
of
wine
and
other
liquor
sling
on
their
shoulder
;
all
which
the
waiter
above
draw
up
,
as
I
want
,
in
a
very
ingenious
manner
,
by
certain
cord
,
as
we
draw
the
bucket
up
a
well
in
Europe
.
 
<EOS>
a
dish
of
their
meat
be
a
good
mouthful
,
and
a
barrel
of
their
liquor
a
reasonable
draught
.
 
<EOS>
Their
mutton
yield
to
ours
,
but
their
beef
be
excellent
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
have
a
sirloin
so
large
,
that
I
have
be
force
to
make
three
bite
of
it
;
but
this
be
rare
.
 
<EOS>
My
servant
be
astonish
to
see
me
eat
it
,
bone
and
all
,
as
in
our
country
we
do
the
leg
of
a
lark
.
 
<EOS>
Their
goose
and
turkey
I
usually
eat
at
a
mouthful
,
and
I
confess
they
far
exceed
ours
.
 
<EOS>
of
their
small
fowl
I
could
take
up
twenty
or
thirty
at
the
end
of
my
knife
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
his
imperial
majesty
,
be
inform
of
my
way
of
living
,
desire
"
<EOS>
that
himself
and
his
royal
consort
,
with
the
young
prince
of
the
blood
of
both
sex
,
may
have
the
happiness
,
"
as
he
be
pleased
to
call
it
,
"
of
dine
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
come
accordingly
,
and
I
place
them
in
chair
of
state
,
upon
my
table
,
just
over
against
me
,
with
their
guard
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
Flimnap
,
the
lord
high
treasurer
,
attend
there
likewise
with
his
white
staff
;
and
I
observe
he
often
look
on
me
with
a
sour
countenance
,
which
I
would
not
seem
to
regard
,
but
eat
more
than
usual
,
in
honour
to
my
dear
country
,
as
well
as
to
fill
the
court
with
admiration
.

I
have
some
private
reason
to
believe
,
that
this
visit
from
his
majesty
give
Flimnap
an
opportunity
of
do
me
ill
office
to
his
master
.
<EOS>
that
minister
have
always
be
my
secret
enemy
,
though
he
outwardly
caress
me
more
than
be
usual
to
the
moroseness
of
his
nature
.
<EOS>
He
represent
to
the
emperor
"
the
low
condition
of
his
treasury
;
that
he
be
force
to
take
up
money
at
a
great
discount
;
that
exchequer
bill
would
not
circulate
under
nine
per
cent
.
<EOS>
below
par
;
that
I
have
cost
his
majesty
above
a
million
and
a
half
of
sprug
"
(
their
great
gold
coin
,
about
the
bigness
of
a
spangle
)
"
and
,
upon
the
whole
,
that
it
would
be
advisable
in
the
emperor
to
take
the
first
fair
occasion
of
dismiss
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
here
oblige
to
vindicate
the
reputation
of
an
excellent
lady
,
who
be
an
innocent
sufferer
upon
my
account
.
 
<EOS>
the
treasurer
take
a
fancy
to
be
jealous
of
his
wife
,
from
the
malice
of
some
evil
tongue
,
who
inform
him
that
her
grace
have
take
a
violent
affection
for
my
person
;
and
the
court
scandal
run
for
some
time
,
that
she
once
come
privately
to
my
lodging
.
 
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
I
solemnly
declare
to
be
a
most
infamous
falsehood
,
without
any
ground
,
further
than
that
her
grace
be
pleased
to
treat
me
with
all
innocent
mark
of
freedom
and
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
I
own
she
come
often
to
my
house
,
but
always
publicly
,
nor
ever
without
three
more
in
the
coach
,
who
be
usually
her
sister
and
young
daughter
,
and
some
particular
acquaintance
;
but
this
be
common
to
many
other
lady
of
the
court
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
still
appeal
to
my
servant
round
,
whether
they
at
any
time
see
a
coach
at
my
door
,
without
know
what
person
be
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
on
those
occasion
,
when
a
servant
have
give
me
notice
,
my
custom
be
to
go
immediately
to
the
door
,
and
,
after
pay
my
respect
,
to
take
up
the
coach
and
two
horse
very
carefully
in
my
hand
(
for
,
if
there
be
six
horse
,
the
postillion
always
unharness
four
,
)
and
place
them
on
a
table
,
where
I
have
fix
a
movable
rim
quite
round
,
of
five
inch
high
,
to
prevent
accident
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
often
have
four
coach
and
horse
at
once
on
my
table
,
full
of
company
,
while
I
sit
in
my
chair
,
lean
my
face
towards
them
;
and
when
I
be
engage
with
one
set
,
the
coachman
would
gently
drive
the
other
round
my
table
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
pass
many
an
afternoon
very
agreeably
in
these
conversation
.
<EOS>
but
I
defy
the
treasurer
,
or
his
two
informer
(
I
will
name
them
,
and
let
them
make
the
good
of
it
)
Clustril
and
Drunlo
,
to
prove
that
any
person
ever
come
to
me
incognito
,
except
the
secretary
Reldresal
,
who
be
send
by
express
command
of
his
imperial
majesty
,
as
I
have
before
relate
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
dwell
so
long
upon
this
particular
,
if
it
have
not
be
a
point
wherein
the
reputation
of
a
great
lady
be
so
nearly
concern
,
to
say
nothing
of
my
own
;
though
I
then
have
the
honour
to
be
a
nardac
,
which
the
treasurer
himself
be
not
;
for
all
the
world
know
,
that
he
be
only
a
glumglum
,
a
title
inferior
by
one
degree
,
as
that
of
a
marquis
be
to
a
duke
in
England
;
yet
I
allow
he
precede
me
in
right
of
his
post
.
 
<EOS>
these
false
information
,
which
I
afterwards
come
to
the
knowledge
of
by
an
accident
not
proper
to
mention
,
make
the
treasurer
show
his
lady
for
some
time
an
ill
countenance
,
and
me
a
bad
;
and
although
he
be
at
last
undeceived
and
reconcile
to
her
,
yet
I
lose
all
credit
with
him
,
and
find
my
interest
decline
very
fast
with
the
emperor
himself
,
who
be
,
indeed
,
too
much

by
that
favourite

<EOS>
His
reception
there
.
 
<EOS>
before
I
proceed
to
give
an
account
of
my
leaving
this
kingdom
,
it
may
be
proper
to
inform
the
reader
of
a
private
intrigue
which
have
be
for
two
month
form
against
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
be
hitherto
,
all
my

,
a
stranger
to
court
,
for
which
I
be
unqualified
by
the
meanness
of
my
condition
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
indeed
hear
and
read
enough
of
the
disposition
of
great
prince
and
minister
,
but
never
expect
to
have
find
such
terrible
effect
of
them
,
in
so
remote
a
country
,
govern
,
as
I
think
,
by
very
different
maxim
from
those
in
Europe
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
be
just
prepare
to
pay
my
attendance
on
the
emperor
of
Blefuscu
,

considerable
person
at

I

be
very

under

come
to
my

very
privately

send
his

desire
admittance

put
the

with
his

into

:
 
and
,
give
order
to
a
trusty
servant
,
to
say
I
be
indispose
and
go
to
sleep
,
I
fasten
the
door
of
my
house
,
place
the
chair
on
the
table
,
accord
to
my
usual
custom
,
and
sit
down
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
after
the
common
salutation
be
over
,
observe
his
lordship
's
countenance
full
of
concern

inquire
into
the

I
would
hear
him
with
patience

highly

my

His
speech
be
to
the
follow
effect

I
take
note
of
it
as
soon
as
he
leave
me

,
as

he
accuse

so
far

a
remedy

evil

increase

your
judge

,
in
their
own
conscience

fully
convince
of
your
guilt

which
be
a
sufficient
argument
to
condemn
you
to
death
,
without
the
formal
proof
require
by
the
strict
letter
of
the
law

<EOS>
"
but
his
imperial
majesty

fully
determine
against
capital
punishment
,
be
graciously
pleased
to
say
,
that
since
the
council
think
the
loss
of
your
eye
too
easy
a
censure

some
other
way
may
be
inflict
hereafter
.
 
<EOS>
and
your
friend
the

,
humbly
desire
to
be
hear
again
,
in
answer
to
what
the
treasurer
have
object
,
concern
the
great
charge
his
majesty

that
his

may
easily
provide
against

evil
,
by
gradually
lessen
your

;
by
which
,
for
want
of
sufficient
for
you
would
grow
weak
and
faint
,
and
lose
your
appetite

and
consequently
,
decay
,
and
consume
in
a
few
month
;
<EOS>
neither
would
the
stench
of
your
carcass
be
then
so
dangerous
,
when
it
should
become
more
than
half
diminished
;
and
immediately
upon
your
death
five
or
six
thousand
of
his
majesty
's
subject
may
,
in
two
or
three
day
,
cut
your
flesh
from
your
bone
,
take
it
away
by
cart
-
load
,
and
bury
it
in
distant
part
,
to
prevent
infection
,
leave
the
skeleton
as
a
monument
of
admiration
to
posterity
.
  
<EOS>
"
thus
,
by
the
great
friendship
of
the
secretary
,
the
whole
affair
be
compromise
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
strictly
enjoin
,
that
the
project
of
starve
you
by
degree
should
be
keep
a
secret
;
but
the
sentence
of
put
out
your
eye
be
enter
on
the
book
;
none
dissenting
,
except
Bolgolam
the
admiral
,
who
,
be
a
creature
of
the
empress
,
be
perpetually
instigate
by
her
majesty
to
insist
upon
your
death
,
she
have
bear
perpetual
malice
against
you
,
on
account
of
that
infamous
and
illegal
method
you
take
to
extinguish
the
fire
in
her
apartment
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
three
day
your
friend
the
secretary
will
be
direct
to
come
to
your
house
,
and
read
before
you
the
article
of
impeachment
;
and
then
to
signify
the
great
lenity
and
favour
of
his
majesty
and
council
,
whereby
you
be
only
condemn
to
the
loss
of
your
eye
,
which
his
majesty
do
not
question
you
will
gratefully
and
humbly
submit
to
;
and
twenty
of
his
majesty
's
surgeon
will
attend
,
in
order
to
see
the
operation
well
perform
,
by
discharge
very
sharp
-
point
arrow
into
the
ball
of
your
eye
,
as
you
lie
on
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
leave
to
your
prudence
what
measure
you
will
take
;
and
to
avoid
suspicion
,
I
must
immediately
return
in
as
private
a
manner
as
I
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
do
so
;
and
I
remain
alone
,
under
many
doubt
and
perplexity
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
custom
introduce
by
this
prince
and
his
ministry
(
very
different
,
as
I
have
be
assure
,
from
the
practice
of
former
time
,
)
that
after
the
court
have
decree
any
cruel
execution
,
either
to
gratify
the
monarch
's
resentment
,
or
the
malice
of
a
favourite
,
the
emperor
always
make
a
speech
to
his
whole
council
,
express
his
great
lenity
and
tenderness
,
as
quality
know
and
confess
by
all
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
this
speech
be
immediately
publish
throughout
the
kingdom
;
nor
do
any
thing
terrify
the
people
so
much
as
those
encomium
on
his
majesty
's
mercy
;
because
it
be
observe
,
that
the
more
these
praise
be
enlarge
and
insist
on
,
the
more
inhuman
be
the
punishment
,
and
the
sufferer
more
innocent
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
as
to
myself
,
I
must
confess
,
have
never
be
design
for
a
courtier
,
either
by
my
birth
or
education
<EOS>
,
I
be
so
ill
<EOS>
a
judge
of
thing
<EOS>
,
that
I
could
not
discover
the
lenity
and
favour
of
this
sentence
,
but
conceive
it
(
perhaps
erroneously
)
rather
to
be
rigorous
than
gentle
.
 
<EOS>
I
sometimes
think
of
stand
my
trial
,
for
,
although
I
could
not
deny
the
fact
allege
in
the
several
article
,
yet
I
hope
they
would
admit
of
some
extenuation
.
<EOS>
but
have
in
my
life
peruse
many
state
-
trial
,
which
I
ever
observe
to
terminate
as
the
judge
think
fit
to
direct
,
I
durst
not
rely
on
so
dangerous
a
decision
,
in
so
critical
a
juncture
,
and
against
such
powerful
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
once
I
be
strongly
bent
upon
resistance
,
for
,
while
I
have
liberty
the
whole
strength
of
that
empire
could
hardly
subdue
me
,
and
I
may
easily
with
stone
pelt
the
metropolis
to
piece
;
but
I
soon
reject
that
project
with
horror
,
by
remember
the
oath
I
have
make
to
the
emperor
,
the
favour
I
receive
from
him
,
and
the
high
title
of
nardac
he
confer
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
neither
have
I
so
soon
learn
the
gratitude
of
courtier
,
to
persuade
myself
,
that
his
majesty
's
present
seventy
acquit
me
of
all
past
obligation
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
I
fix
upon
a
resolution
,
for
which
it
be
probable
I
may
incur
some
censure
,
and
not
unjustly
;
for
I
confess
I
owe
the
preserving
of
mine
eye
,
and
consequently
my
liberty
,
to
my
own
great
rashness
and
want
of
experience
;
because
,
if
I
have
then
know
the
nature
of
prince
and
minister
,
which
I
have
since
observe
in
many
other
court
,
and
their
method
of
treat
criminal
less
obnoxious
than
myself
,
I
should
,
with
great
alacrity
and
readiness
,
have
submit
to
so
easy
a
punishment
.
 
<EOS>
but
hurry
on
by
the
precipitancy
of
youth
,
and
have
his
imperial
majesty
's
license
to
pay
my
attendance
upon
the
emperor
of
Blefuscu
<EOS>
,
I
take
this
opportunity
,
before
the
three
day
be
elapse
,
to
send
a
letter
to
my
friend
the
secretary
,
signify
my
resolution
of
set
out
that
morning
for
Blefuscu
,
pursuant
to
the
leave
I
have
get
;
and
,
without
wait
for
an
answer
,
I
go
to
that
side
of
the
island
where
our
fleet
lie
.
 
<EOS>
I
seize
a
large
man
of
war
,
tie
a
cable
to
the
prow
,
and
,
lift
up
the
anchor
<EOS>
,
I
strip
myself
,
put
my
clothe
(
together
with
my
coverlet
,
which
I
carry
under
my
arm
)
into
the
vessel
,
and
,
draw
it
after
me
,
between
wading
and
swimming
<EOS>
arrive
at
the
royal
port
of
Blefuscu
,
where
the
people
have
long
expect
me
:
 
<EOS>
they
lend
me
two
guide
to
direct
me
to
the
capital
city
,
which
be
of
the
same
name
.
 
<EOS>
I
hold
them
in
my
hand
,
till
I
come
within
two
hundred
yard
of
the
gate
,
and
desire
them
"
to
signify
my
arrival
to
one
of
the
secretary
,
and
let
him
know
<EOS>
,
I
there
wait
his
majesty
's
command
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
have
an
answer
in
about
an
hour
,
"
that
his
majesty
,
attend
by
the
royal
family
,
and
great
officer
of
the
court
,
be
come
out
to
receive
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
advance
a
hundred
yard
.
 
<EOS>
the
emperor
and
his
train
alight
from
their
horse
,
the
empress
and
lady
from
their
coach
,
and
I
do
not
perceive
they
be
in
any
fright
or
concern
.
 
<EOS>
I
lie
on
the
ground
to
kiss
his
majesty
's
and
the
empress
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
his
majesty
,
"
that
I
be
come
accord
to
my
promise
,
and
with
the
license
of
the
emperor
my
master
,
to
have
the
honour
of
see
so
mighty
a
monarch
,
and
to
offer
him
any
service
in
my
power
,
consistent
with
my
duty
to
my
own
prince
;
"
not
mention
a
word
of
my
disgrace
,
because
I
have
hitherto
no
regular
information
of
it
,
and
may
suppose
myself
wholly
ignorant
of
any
such
design
;
neither
could
I
reasonably
conceive
that
the
emperor
would
discover
the
secret
,
while
I
be
out
of
his
power
;
wherein
,
however
,
it
soon
appear
I
be
deceive
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
not
trouble
the
reader
with
the
particular
account
of
my
reception
at
this
court
,
which
be
suitable
to
the
generosity
of
so
great
a
prince
;
nor
of
the
difficulty
I
be
in
for
want
of
a
house
and
bed
,
be
force
to
lie
on
the
ground
,
wrap
up
in
my
coverlet
.
   
<EOS>
the
author
,
by
a
lucky
accident
,
find
mean
to
leave
Blefuscu
;
and
,
after
some
difficulty
,
return
safe
to
his
native
country
.
 
<EOS>
three
day
after
my
arrival
,
walk
out
of
curiosity
to
the
north
-
east
coast
of
the
island
,
I
observe
,
about
half
a
league
off
in
the
sea
,
somewhat
that
look
like
a
boat
overturn
.
 
<EOS>
I
pull
off
my
shoe
and
stocking
,
and
,
wail
two
or
three
hundred
yard
<EOS>
,
I
find
the
object
to
approach
nearer
by
force
of
the
tide
;
and
then
plainly
see
it
to
be
a
real
boat
,
which
I
suppose
may
by
some
temp
have
be
drive
from
a
ship
.
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
,
I
return
immediately
towards
the
city
,
and
desire
his
imperial
majesty
to
lend
me
twenty
of
the
tall
vessel
he
have
leave
,
after
the
loss
of
his
fleet
,
and
three
thousand
seaman
,
under
the
command
of
his
vice
-
admiral
.
 
<EOS>
this
fleet
sail
round
,
while
I
go
back
the
short
way
to
the
coast
,
where
I
first
discover
the
boat
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
the
tide
have
drive
it
still
near
.
 
<EOS>
the
seaman
be
all
provide
with
cordage
,
which
I
have
beforehand
twist
to
a
sufficient
strength
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
ship
come
up
,
I
strip
myself
,
and
wade
till
I
come
within
a
hundred
yard
off
the
boat
,
after
which
I
be
force
to
swim
till
I
get
up
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
seaman
throw
me
the
end
of
the
cord
,
which
I
fasten
to
a
hole
in
the
fore
-
part
of
the
boat
,
and
the
other
end
to
a
man
of
war
;
but
I
find
all
my
labour
to
little
purpose
;
for
,
be
out
of
my
depth
,
I
be
not
able
to
work
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
necessity
I
be
force
to
swim
behind
,
and
push
the
boat
forward
,
as
often
as
I
could
,
with
one
of
my
hand
;
and
the
tide
favour
me
,
I
advance
so
far
that
I
could
just
hold
up
my
chin
and
feel
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
I
rest
two
or
three
minute
,
and
then
give
the
boat
another
shove
,
and
so
on
,
till
the
sea
be
no
high
than
my
arm
-
pit
;
and
now
,
the
most
laborious
part
be
over
,
I
take
out
my
other
cable
,
which
be
stow
in
one
of
the
ship
,
and
fasten
them
first
to
the
boat
,
and
then
to
nine
of
the
vessel
which
attend
me
;
the
wind
be
favourable
,
the
seaman
tow
,
and
I
shove
,
until
we
arrive
within
forty
yard
of
the
shore
;
and
,
wait
till
the
tide
be
out
<EOS>
,
I
get
dry
to
the
boat
,
and
by
the
assistance
of
two
thousand
man
,
with
rope
and
engine
,
I
make
a
shift
to
turn
it
on
its
bottom
,
and
find
it
be
but
little
damaged
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
not
trouble
the
reader
with
the
difficulty
I
be
under
,
by
the
help
of
certain
paddle
,
which
cost
me
ten
day
make
,
to
get
my
boat
to
the
royal
port
of
Blefuscu
,
where
a
mighty
concourse
of
people
appear
upon
my
arrival
,
full
of
wonder
at
the
sight
of
so
prodigious
a
vessel
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
the
emperor
"
that
my
good
fortune
have
throw
this
boat
in
my
way
,
to
carry
me
to
some
place
<EOS>
whence
<EOS>
I
may
return
into
my
native
country
;
and
beg
his
majesty
's
order
for
get
material
to
fit
it
up
,
together
with
his
license
to
depart
;
"
which
,
after
some
kind
expostulation
,
he
be
pleased
to
grant
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
very
much
wonder
,
in
all
this
time
,
not
to
have
hear
of
any
express
relate
to
me
from
our
emperor
to
the
court
of
Blefuscu
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
afterward
give
privately
to
understand
,
that
his
imperial
majesty
,
never
imagine
<EOS>
I
have
the
least
notice
of
his
design
<EOS>
,
believe
I
be
only
go
to
Blefuscu
in
performance
of
my
promise
,
accord
to
the
license
he
have
give
me
,
which
be
well
know
at
our
court
,
and
would
return
in
a
few
day
,
when
the
ceremony
be
end
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
at
last
in
pain
at
my
long
absence
;
and
after
consult
with
the
treasurer
and
the
rest
of
that
cabal
,
a
person
of
quality
be
dispatch
with
the
copy
of
the
article
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
this
envoy
have
instruction
to
represent
to
the
monarch
of
Blefuscu
,
"
the
great
lenity
of
his
master
,
who
be
content
to
punish
me
no
farther
than
with
the
loss
of
mine
eye
;
that
I
have
flee
from
justice
;
and
if
I
do
not
return
in
two
hour
,
I
should
be
deprive
of
my
title
of
nardac
,
and
declare
a
traitor
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
envoy
further
add
,
"
that
in
order
to
maintain
the
peace
and
amity
between
both
empire
,
his
master
expect
that
his
brother
of
Blefuscu
would
give
order
to
have
me
send
back
to
Lilliput
,
bind
hand
and
foot
,
to
be
punish
as
a
traitor
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
emperor
of
Blefuscu
,
have
take
three
day
to
consult
,
return
an
answer
consist
of
many
civility
and
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
that
as
for
send
me
bind
,
his
brother
know
it
be
impossible
;
that
,
although
I
have
deprive
him
of
his
fleet
,
yet
he
owe
great
obligation
to
me
for
many
good
office
I
have
do
him
in
make
the
peace
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
however
,
both
their
majesty
would
soon
be
make
easy
;
for
I
have
find
a
prodigious
vessel
on
the
shore
,
able
to
carry
me
on
the
sea
,
which
he
have
give
order
to
fit
up
,
with
my
own
assistance
and
direction
;
and
he
hope
,
in
a
few
week
,
both
empire
would
be
free
from
so
insupportable
an
encumbrance
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
this
answer
the
envoy
return
to
Lilliput
;
and
the
monarch
of
Blefuscu
relate
to
me
all
that
have

;
offer
me
at
the
same
time
(
but
under
the
strict
confidence
)
<EOS>
his
gracious
protection
,
if
I
would
continue
in
his
service
;
wherein
,
although
I
believe
him
sincere
,
<EOS>
yet
I
resolve
never
more
to
put
any
confidence
in
prince
or
minister
,
where
I
could
possibly
avoid
it
;
and
therefore
,
with
all
due
acknowledgment
for
his
favourable
intention
,
I
humbly
beg
to
be
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
"
that
since
fortune
,
whether
good
or
evil
,
have
throw
a
vessel
in
my
way
,
I
be
resolve
to
venture
myself
on
the
ocean
,
rather
than
be
an
occasion
of
difference
between
two
such
mighty
monarchs
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
neither
<EOS>
do
I
find
the
emperor
at
all
displeased
;
and
I
discover
,
by
a
certain
accident
,
that
he
be
very
glad
of
my
resolution
,
and
so
be
most
of
his
minister
.
  
<EOS>
these
consideration
move
me
to
hasten
my
departure
somewhat
sooner
than
I
intend
;
to
which
the
court
,
impatient
to
have
me
go

very
readily

,
when
all

prepared
,
I
send
to
receive
his

command
,
and
to
take
my
leave

<EOS>
the
emperor
and
royal
family
come
out
of
the
palace

I
lie
down
on

to
kiss
his

graciously
give

His

together
with

which
I
put
immediately

to
keep

hurt

<EOS>
the
ceremony
at
my
departure
be
too
many
to
trouble
the
reader
with
at
this
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
store
the
boat
with
the
carcase
of
a
hundred
oxen
,
and
three
hundred
sheep
,
with
bread
and
drink
proportionable

and
as

<EOS>
I
take
with

six
cow
and
two
bull
alive
,
with
as
many
ewes
and
ram
,
intend
to
carry
them
into
my
own

,
and
propagate
the
breed
.
 
<EOS>
and
to
feed
them
on
board
,
I
have
a
good
bundle
of
hay
,
and
a
bag
of
corn
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
gladly
have
take
a
dozen
of
the
native
,
but
this
be
a
thing
the
emperor
would
by
no
means
permit
;
and
,
besides
a
diligent
search
into
my
pocket
,
his
majesty
engage
my
honour
"
not
to
carry
away
any
of
his
subject
,
although
with
their
own
consent
and
desire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
have
thus
prepare
all
thing
as
well
as
I
be
able
,
I
set
sail
on
the
twenty
-
fourth
day
of
September
1701
,
at
six
in
the
morning
;
and
when
I
have
go
about
four
-
league
to
the
northward
,
the
wind
be
at
south
-
east
,
at
six
in
the
evening
<EOS>
I
descry
a
small
island
,
about
half
a
league
to
the
north
-
west
.
 
<EOS>
I
advance
forward
,
and
cast
anchor
on
the
lee
-
side
of
the
island
,
which
seem
to
be
uninhabite
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
take
some
refreshment
,
and
go
to
my
rest
.
 
<EOS>
I
sleep
well
,
and
as
I
conjecture
at
least
six
hour
,
for
I
find
the
day
break
in
two
hour
after
I
awake
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
clear
night
.
<EOS>
I
eat
my
breakfast
before
the
sun
be
up
;
and
heaving
anchor
,
the
wind
be
favourable
,
I
steer
the
same
course
that
I
have
do
the
day
before
,
wherein
I
be
direct
by
my
pocket
compass
.
 
<EOS>
My
intention
be
to
reach
,
if
possible
,
one
of
those
island
.
<EOS>
which
I
have
reason
to
believe
lie
to
the
north
-
east
of
Van
Diemen
's
Land
.
<EOS>
I
discover
nothing
all
that
day
;
but
upon
the
next
,
about
three
in
the
afternoon
,
when
I
have
by
my
computation
make
twenty
-
four
league
from
Blefuscu
,
I
descry
a
sail
steering
to
the
south
-
east
;
my
course
be
due
east
.
 
<EOS>
I
hail
her
,
but
could
get
no
answer
;
yet
I
find
I
gain
upon
her
,
for
the
wind
slacken
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
all
the
sail
I
could
,
and
in
half
an
hour
she
spy
me
,
then
hang
out
her
ancient
,
and
discharge
a
gun
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
easy
to
express
the
joy
I
be
in
,
upon
the
unexpected
hope
of
once
more
see
my
beloved
country
,
and
the
dear
pledge
I
leave
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
ship
slacken
her
sail
,
and
I
come
up
with
her
between
five
and
six
in
the
evening
,
September
26th
;
but
my
heart
leap
within
me
to
see
her
english
colour
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
my
cow
and
sheep
into
my
coat
-
pocket
,
and
get
on
board
with
all
my
little
cargo
of
provision
.
<EOS>
the
vessel
be
an
english
merchantman
,
return
from
Japan
by
the
North
and
South
seas
;
the
captain
,
Mr.
John
Biddel
,
of
Deptford
,
a
very
civil
man
,
and
an
excellent
sailor
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
now
in
the
latitude
of
30
degree
south
;
there
be
about
fifty
man
in
the
ship
;
and
here
I
meet
an
old
comrade
of
mine
,
one
Peter
Williams
,
who
give
me
a
good
character
to
the
captain
.
 
<EOS>
this
gentleman
treat
me
with
kindness
,
and
desire
I
would
let
him
know
what
place
I
come
from
last
,
and
whither
I
be
bind
;
which
I
do
in
a
few
word
,
but
he
think
I
be
rave
,
and
that
the
danger
I
undergo
have
disturb
my
head
;
whereupon
I
take
my
black
cattle
and
sheep
out
of
my
pocket
,
which
,
after
great
astonishment
,
clearly
convince
him
of
my
veracity
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
show
him
the
gold
give
me
by
the
emperor
of
Blefuscu
,
together
with
his
majesty
's
picture
at
full
length
,
and
some
other
rarity
of
that
country
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
him
two
purse
of
two
hundred
sprug
each
,
and
promise
,
when
we
arrive
in
England
,
to
make
him
a
present
of
a
cow
and
a
sheep
big
with
young
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
not
trouble
the
reader
with
a
particular
account
of
this
voyage
,
which
be
very
prosperous
for
the
most
part
.
 
<EOS>
We
arrive
in
the
Downs
on
the
13th
of
April
,
1702
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
one
misfortune
,
that
the
rat
on
board
carry
away
one
of
my
sheep
;
I
find
her
bone
in
a
hole
,
pick
clean
from
the
flesh
.
 
<EOS>
the
rest
of
my
cattle
<EOS>
I
get
safe
ashore
,
and
set
them
a
-
grazing
in
a
bowling
-
green
at
Greenwich
,
where
the
fineness
of
the
grass
make
them
feed
very
heartily
,
though
I
have
always
fear
the
contrary
:
 
neither
<EOS>
could
I
possibly
have
preserve
them
in
so
long
a
voyage
,
if
the
captain
have
not
allow
me
some
of
his
good
biscuit
,
which
,
rub
to
powder
,
and
mingle
with
water
,
be
their
constant
food
.
 
<EOS>
the
short
time
I
continue
in
England
,
I
make
a
considerable
profit
by
show
my
cattle
to
many
person
of
quality
and
other
:
 
and
before
I
begin
my
second
voyage
,
I
sell
them
for
six
hundred
pound
.
 
<EOS>
since
my
last
return
I
find
the
breed
be
considerably
increase
,
especially
the
sheep
,
which
I
hope
will
prove
much
to
the
advantage
of
the
woollen
manufacture
,
by
the
fineness
of
the
fleece
.
  
<EOS>
I
stay
but
<EOS>
two
month
with
my
wife
and
family
,
for
my
insatiable
desire
of
see
foreign
country
,
would
suffer
me
to
continue
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
I
leave
fifteen
hundred
pound
with
my
wife
,
and
fix
her
in
a
good
house
at
Redriff
.
 
<EOS>
My
remain
stock
I
carry
with
me

part
in
money
and
part
in
good
,
in
hope
to
improve
my
fortune

the
Black
Bull
in
Fetter

which

so

in

after

I
again
leave
my
native
country

and
take
ship
in
the
Downs
,
on
the
20th
day
of
June
,
1702
,
in
the
Adventure
,
Captain
John
Nicholas
,
a
cornish
man
,
commander
,
bind
for
Surat
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
a
very
prosperous
gale
,
till
we
arrive
at
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
,
where
we
land
for
fresh
water
;
but
discover
a
leak
,
we
unship
our
good
and
winter
there
;
for
the
captain
fall
sick
of
an
ague
,
we
could
not
leave
the
Cape
till
the
end
of
March
.
 
<EOS>
We
then
set
sail
,
and
have
a
good
voyage
till
we
pass
the
Straits
of
Madagascar
;
but
have
get
northward
of
that
island
,
and
to
about
five
degree
south
latitude
,
the
wind
,
which
in
those
sea
be
observe
to
blow
a
constant
equal
gale
between
the
north
and
west
,
from
the
beginning
of
December
to
the
beginning
of
May
,
on
the
19th
of
April
begin
to
blow
with
much
great
violence
,
and
more
westerly
than
usual
,
continue
so
for
twenty
day
together
:
 
during
which
time
,
we
be
drive
a
little
to
the
east
of
the
Molucca
Islands
,
and
about
three
degree
northward
of
the
line
,
as
our
captain
find
by
an
observation
he
take
the
2nd
of
May
,
at
which
time
the
wind
cease
,
and
it
be
a
perfect
calm
,
whereat
<EOS>
I
be
not
a
little
rejoice
.
<EOS>
but
he
,
be
a
man
well
experienced
in
the
navigation
of
those
sea
,
bid
us
all
prepare
against
a
storm
,
which
accordingly
happen
the
day
follow
:
 
for
the
southern
wind
,
call
the
southern
monsoon
,
begin
to
set
in
.
  
<EOS>
find
it
be
likely
to
overblow
,
we
take
in
our
sprit
-
sail
,
and
stand
by
to
hand
the
fore
-
sail
;
but
make
foul
weather
,
we
look
the
gun
be
all
fast
,
and
hand
the
mizen
.
 
<EOS>
the
ship
lie
very
broad
off
,
so
we
think
it
better
spoon
before
the
sea
,
than
try
or
hulling
.
 
<EOS>
We
reef
the
fore
-
sail
and
set
him
,
and
haul
aft
the
fore
-
sheet
;
the
helm
be
hard
a

weather
.
 
<EOS>
the
ship
wear
bravely
.
 
<EOS>
We
belay
the
fore
down
-
haul
;
but
the
sail
be
split
,
and
we
haul
down
the
yard
,
and
get
the
sail
into
the
ship
,
and
unbound
all
the
thing
clear
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
fierce
storm
;
the
sea
break
strange
and
dangerous
.
 
<EOS>
We
haul
off
upon
the
laniard
of
the
whip
-
staff
,
and
help
the
man
at
the
helm
.
 
<EOS>
We
would
not
get
down
our
topmast
,
but
let
all
stand
,
because
she
scud
before
the
sea
very
well
,
and
we
know
that
the
top
-
mast
be
aloft
,
the
ship
be
the
wholesomer
,
and
make
well
way
through
the
sea
,
see
we
have
sea
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
storm
be
over
,
we
set
fore
-
sail
and
main
-
sail
,
and
bring
the
ship
to
.
 
<EOS>
then
we
set
the
mizen
,
main
-
top
-
sail
,
and
the
fore
-
top
-
sail
.
 
<EOS>
Our
course
be
east
-
north
-
east
,
the
wind
be
at
south
-
west
.
 
<EOS>
We
get
the
starboard
tack
aboard
,
we
cast
off
our
weather
-
brace
and
lift
;
we
set
in
the
lee
-
brace
,
and
haul
forward
by
the
weather
-
bowling
,
and
haul
them
tight
,
and
belay
them
,
and
haul
over
the
mizen
tack
to
windward
,
and
keep
her
full
and
by
as
near
as
she
would
lie
.
  
<EOS>
during
this
storm
,
which
be
follow
by
a
strong
wind
west
-
south-
west
,
we
be
carry
,
by
my
computation
,
about
five
hundred
league
to
the
east
,
so
that
the
old
sailor
on
board
could
not
tell
in
what
part
of
the
world
we
be
.
 
<EOS>
Our
provision
hold
out
well
,
our

be
staunch

and
our

all
in
good
health
;
but
we
lay
in
the
utmost
distress
for
water
.
 
<EOS>
We
think
it
best
to
hold
on
the
same
course
,
rather
than
turn
more
northerly
,
which
may
have
bring
us
to
the
north
-
west
part
of
Great
Tartary
,
and
into
the
Frozen
Sea
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
16th
day
of
June
,
1703
,
a
boy
on
the
top
-
mast
discover
land
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
17th
,
we
come
in
full
view
of
a
great
island
,
or
continent
(
for
we
know
not
whether
;
)
on
the
south
side
<EOS>
whereof
be
a
small
neck
of
land
jut
out
into
the
sea
,
and
a
creek
too
shallow
to
hold
a
ship
of
above
one
hundred
ton
.
 
<EOS>
We
cast
anchor
within
a
league
of
this
creek
,
and
our
captain
send
a
dozen
of
his
man
<EOS>
well
armed
in
the
long
-
boat
,
with
vessel
for
water
,
if
any
could
be
find
.
 
<EOS>
I
desire
his
leave
to
go
with
them
,
that
I
may
see
the
country
,
and
make
what
discovery
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
land
we
see
no
river
or
spring
,
nor
any
sign
of
inhabitant
.
<EOS>
Our
man
therefore
wander
on
the
shore
to
find
out
some
fresh
water
near
the
sea
,
and
I
walk
alone
about
a
mile
on
the
other
side
,
where
I
observe
the
country
all
barren
and
rocky
.
 
<EOS>
I
now
begin
to
be
weary
,
and
see
nothing
to
entertain
my
curiosity
,
I
return
gently
down
towards
the
creek
;
and
the
sea
be
full
in
my
view
<EOS>
,
I
see
our
man
already
get
into
the
boat
,
and
row
for
life
to
the
ship
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
holla
after
them
,
although
it
have
be
to
little
purpose
,
when
I
observe
a
huge
creature
walk
after
them
in
the
sea
,
as
fast
as
he
could
:
 
<EOS>
he
wade
not
much
deep
than
his
knee
,
and
take
prodigious
stride
:
 
but
our
man
have
the
start
of
him
half
a
league
,
and
,
the
sea
thereabout
be
full
of
sharp
-
pointed
rock
,
the
monster
be
not
able
to
overtake
the
boat
.
 
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
I
be
afterwards
tell
,
for
I
durst
not
stay
to
see
the
issue
of
the
adventure
;
but
run
as
fast
as
I
could
the
way
I
first
go
,
and
then
climb
up
a
steep
hill
,
which
give
me
some
prospect
of
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
it
fully
cultivate
;
but
that
which
first
surprise
me
be
the
length
of
the
grass
,
which
,
in
those
ground
that
seem
to
be
keep
for
hay
,
be
about
twenty
foot
high
.
  
<EOS>
I
fall
into
a
high
road
,
for
<EOS>
so
I
take
it
to
be
,
though
it
serve
to
the
inhabitant
only
as
a
foot
-
path
through
a
field
of
barley
.
<EOS>
here
I
walk
on
for
some
time
,
but
could
see
little
on
either
side
,
it
be
now
near
harvest
,
and
the
corn
rise
at
least
forty
foot
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
an
hour
walk
to
the
end
of
this
field
,
which
be
fence
in
with
a
hedge
of
at
least
one
hundred
and
twenty
foot
high
,
and
the
tree
so
lofty
that
I
could
make
no
computation
of
their
altitude
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
stile
to
pass
from
this
field
into
the
next
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
four
step
,
and
a
stone
to
cross
over
when
you
come
to
the
uppermost
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
me
to
climb
this
stile
,
because
every
step
be
six
-
foot
high
,
and
the
upper
stone
about
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
endeavour
to
find
some
gap
in
the
hedge
,
when
I
discover
one
of
the
inhabitant
in
the
next
field
,
advance
towards
the
stile
,
of
the
same
size
with
him
whom
I
see
in
the
sea
pursue
our
boat
.
 
<EOS>
He
appear
as
tall
as
an
ordinary
spire
steeple
,
and
take
about
ten
yard
at
every
stride
,
as
near
as
I
could
guess
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
strike
with
the
utmost
fear
and
astonishment
,
and
run
to
hide
myself
in
the
corn
<EOS>
,
whence
I
see
him
at
the
top
of
the
stile
look
back
into
the
next
field
on
the
right
hand
,
and
hear
him
call
in
a
voice
<EOS>
many
degree
loud
than
a
speaking
-
trumpet
:
<EOS>
but
the
noise
be
so
high
in
the
air
,
that
at
first
I
certainly
think
it
be
thunder
.
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
seven
monster
,
like
himself
,
come
towards
him
with
reaping
-
hook
in
their
hand
,
each
hook
about
the
largeness
of
six
scythe
.
 
<EOS>
these
people
be
not
so
well
clothe
as
the
first
,
whose
servant
or
labourer
they
seem
to
be
;
for
,
upon
some
word
he
speak
,
they
go
to
reap
the
corn
in
the
field
where
I
lie
.
 
<EOS>
I
keep
from
them
at
as
great
a
distance
as
I
could
,
but
be
force
to
move
with
extreme
difficulty
,
for
the
stalk
of
the
corn
be
sometimes
not
above
a
foot
distant
,
so
that
I
could
hardly
squeeze
my
body
betwixt
them
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
make
a
shift
to
go
forward
,
till
I
come
to
a
part
of
the
field
where
the
corn
have
be
lay
by
the
rain
and
wind
.
 
<EOS>
here
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
advance
a
step
;
for
the
stalk
be
so
interwoven
,
that
I
could
not
creep
through
,
and
the
beard
of
the
fall
ear
so
strong
and
point
,
that
they
pierce
through
my
clothe
into
my
flesh
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
I
hear
the
reaper
not
a
hundred
yard
behind
me
.
 
<EOS>
be
quite
dispirit
with
toil
,
and
wholly
overcome
by
grief
and
dispair
,
I
lie
down
between
two
ridge
,
and
heartily
wish
I
may
there
end
my
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
bemoan
my
desolate
widow
and
fatherless
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
lament
my
own
folly
and
wilfulness
,
in
attempt
a
second
voyage
,
against
the
advice
of
all
my
friend
and
relation
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
terrible
agitation
of
mind
,
I
could
not
forbear
thinking
of
Lilliput
,
whose
inhabitant
look
upon
me
as
the
great
prodigy
that
ever
appear
in
the
world
;
where
I
be
able
to
draw
an
imperial
fleet
in
my
hand
,
and
perform
those
other
action
,
which
will
be
record
for
ever
in
the
chronicle
of
that
empire
,
while
posterity
shall
hardly
believe
them
,
although
attest
by
million
.
 
<EOS>
I
reflect
what
a
mortification
it
must
prove
to
me
,
to
appear
as
inconsiderable
in
this
nation
,
as
one
single
Lilliputian
would
be
among
us
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
I
conceive
be
to
be
the
least
of
my
misfortune
;
for
,
as
human
creature
be
observe
to
be
more
savage
and
cruel
in
proportion
to
their
bulk
,
what
could
I
expect
but
to
be
a
morsel
in
the
mouth
of
the
first
among
these
enormous
barbarian
that
should
happen
to
seize
me
?
<EOS>
undoubtedly
philosopher
be
in
the
right
,
when
they
tell
us
that
nothing
be
great
or
little
otherwise
than
by
comparison
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
have
pleased
fortune
,
to
have
let
the
Lilliputians
find
some
nation
,
where
the
people
be
as
diminutive
with
respect
to
them
,
as
they
be
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
who
know
but
that
even
this
prodigious
race
of
mortal
may
be
equally
overmatche
in
some
distant
part
of
the
world
,
whereof
we
have
yet
no
discovery
.
  
<EOS>
scared
and
confound
as
I
be
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
forbear
go
on
with
these
reflection
,
when
one
of
the
reaper
,
approach
within
ten
yard
of
the
ridge
where
I
lay
,
make
me
apprehend
that
with
the
next
step
I
should
be
squash
to
death
under
his
foot
,
or
cut
in
two
with
his
reaping
-
hook
.
 
<EOS>
and
therefore
,
when
he
be
again
about
to
move
,
I
scream
as
loud
as
fear
could
make
me
:
 
<EOS>
whereupon
the
huge
creature
trod
short
,
and
,
look
round
about
under
him
for
some
time
,
at
last
espy
me
as
I
lie
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
He
consider
awhile
,
with
the
caution
of
one
who
endeavour
to
lay
hold
on
a
small
dangerous
animal
in
such
a
manner
that
it
shall
not
be
able
either
to
scratch
or
bite
him
,
as
I
myself
have
sometimes
do
with
a
weasel
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
he
venture
to
take
me
behind
,
by
the
middle
,
between
his
fore
-
finger
and
thumb
,
and
bring
me
within
three
yard
of
his
eye
,
that
he
may
behold
my
shape
more
perfectly
.
 
<EOS>
I
guess
his
meaning
,
and
my
good
fortune
give
me
so
much
presence
of
mind
,
that
I
resolve
not
to
struggle
in
the
least
as
he
hold
me
in
the
air
above
sixty
foot
from
the
ground
,
although
he
grievously
pinch
my
side
,
for
fear
I
should
slip
through
his
finger
.
 
<EOS>
all
I
venture
be
to
raise
mine
eye
towards
the
sun
,
and
place
my
hand
together
in
a
supplicate
posture
,
and
to
speak
some
word
in
a
humble
melancholy
tone
,
suitable
to
the
condition
I
then
be
in
:
 
for
<EOS>
I
apprehend
every
moment
that
he
would
dash
me
against
the
ground
,
as
we
usually
do
any
little
hateful
animal
,
which
we
have
a
mind
to
destroy
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
good
star
would
have
it
,
that
he
appear
pleased
with
my
voice
and
gesture
,
and
begin
to
look
upon
me
as
a
curiosity
,
much
wonder
to
hear
me
pronounce
articulate
word
,
although
he
could
not
understand
them
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
I
be
not
able
to
forbear
groaning
and
shed
tear
,
and
turn
my
head
towards
my
side
;
let
him
know
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
how
cruelly
I
be
hurt
by
the
pressure
of
his
thumb
and
finger
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
to
apprehend
my
meaning
;
for
,
lift
up
the
lappet
of
his
coat
,
he
put
me
gently
into
it
,
and
immediately
run
along
with
me
to
his
master
,
who
be
a
substantial
farmer
,
and
the
same
person
I
have
first
see
in
the
field
.
  
<EOS>
the
farmer
have
(
as
I
suppose
by
their
talk
)
receive
such
an
account
of
me
as
his
servant
could
give
him
,
take
a
piece
of
a
small
straw
,
about
the
size
of
a
walk
-
staff
,
and
therewith
lift
up
the
lappet
of
my
coat
;
<EOS>
which
it
seem
he
think
to
be
some
kind
of
cover
that
nature
have
give
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
blow
my
hair
aside
to
take
a
well
view
of
my
face
.
 
<EOS>
He
call
his
hind
about
him
,
and
ask
them
,
as
I
afterwards
learn
,
whether
they
have
ever
see
in
the
field
any
little
creature
that
resemble
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
place
me
softly
on
the
ground
upon
all
four
,
but
I
get
immediately
up
,
and
walk
slowly
backward
and
forward
,
to
let
those
people
see
I
have
no
intent
to
run
away
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
sit
down
in
a
circle
about
me
,
the
well
to
observe
my
motion
.
 
<EOS>
I
pull
off
my
hat
,
and
make
a
low
bow
towards
the
farmer
.
 
<EOS>
I
fall
on
my
knee
,
and
lift
up
my
hand
and
eye
,
and
speak
several
word
as
loud
as
I
could
:
 
<EOS>
I
take
a
purse
of
gold
out
of
my
pocket
,
and
humbly
present
it
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
receive
it
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
,
then
apply
it
close
to
his
eye
to
see
what
it
be
,
and
afterwards
turn
it
several
time
with
the
point
of
a
pin
(
which
he
take
out
of
his
sleeve
,
)
but
could
make
nothing
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
I
make
a
sign
that
he
should
place
his
hand
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
take
the
purse
,
and
,
open
it
,
pour
all
the
gold
into
his
palm
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
six
spanish
piece
of
four
pistole
each
,
beside
twenty
or
thirty
small
coin
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
wet
the
tip
of
his
little
finger
upon
his
tongue
,
and
take
up
one
of
my
large
piece
,
and
then
another
;
but
he
seem
to
be
wholly
ignorant
what
they
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
me
a
sign
to
put
them
again
into
my
purse
,
and
the
purse
again
into
my
pocket
,
which
,
after
offer
it
to
him
several
time
,
I
think
it
best
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
the
farmer
,
by
this
time
,
be
convince
I
must
be
a
rational
creature
.
 
<EOS>
He
speak
often
to
me
;
but
the
sound
of
his
voice
pierce
my
ear
like
that
of
a
water
-
mill
,
yet
his
word
be
articulate
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
answer
as
loud
as
I
could
in
several
language
,
and
he
often
lay
his
ear
within
two
yard
of
me
:
 
but
all
in
vain
,
for
we
be
wholly
unintelligible
to
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
send
his
servant
to
their
work
,
and
take
his
handkerchief
out
of
his
pocket
,
he
double
and
spread
it
on
his
left
hand
,
which
he
place
flat
on
the
ground
with
the
palm
upward
,
make
me
a
sign
to
step
into
it
,
as
I
could
easily
do
,
for
it
be
not
above
a
foot
in
thickness
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
my
part
to
obey
,
and
,
for
fear
of
fall
,
lay
myself
at
full
length
upon
the
handkerchief
,
with
the
remainder
of
which
he
lap
me
up
to
the
head
for
further
security
,
and
in
this
manner
carry
me
home
to
his
house
.
 
<EOS>
there
he
call
his
wife
,
and
show
me
to
her
;
but
she
scream
and
run
back
,
as
woman
in
England
do
at
the
sight
of
a
toad
or
a
spider
.
<EOS>
however
,
when
she
have
a
while
see
my
behaviour
,
and
<EOS>
how
well
I
observe
the
sign
her
husband
make
,
she
be
soon
reconcile
,
and
by
degree
grow
extremely
tender
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
about
twelve
at
noon
,
and
a
servant
bring
in
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
one
substantial
dish
of
meat
(
fit
for
the
plain
condition
of
a
husbandman
,
)
in
a
dish
of
about
four
-
and
-
twenty
foot
diameter
.
<EOS>
the
company
be
,
the
farmer
and
his
wife
,
three
child
,
and
an
old
grandmother
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
be
sit
down
,
the
farmer
place
me
at
some
distance
from
him
on
the
table
,
which
be
thirty
foot
high
from
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
in
a
terrible
fright
,
and
keep
as
far
as
I
could
from
the
edge
,
for
fear
of
fall
.
 
<EOS>
the
wife
mince
a
bit
of
meat
,
then
crumble
some
bread
on
a
trencher
,
and
place
it
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
her
a
low
bow
,
take
out
my
knife
and
fork
,
and
fall
to
eat
,
which
give
them
exceed
delight
.
 
<EOS>
the
mistress
send
her
maid
for
a
small
dram
cup
,
which
hold
about
two
gallon
,
and
fill
it
with
drink
;
I
take
up
the
vessel
with
much
difficulty
in
both
hand
,
and
in
a
most
respectful
manner
drink
to
her
ladyship
's
health
,
express
the
word
as
loud
as
I
could
in
English
,
which
make
the
company
laugh
so
heartily
,
that
I
be
almost
deafen
with
the
noise
.
 
<EOS>
this
liquor
taste
like
a
small
cider
,
and
be
not
unpleasant
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
master
make
me
a
sign
to
come
to
his
trencher
side
;
but
as
I
walk
on
the
table
,
be
in
great
surprise
all
the
time
,
as
the
indulgent
reader
will
easily
conceive
and
excuse
,
I
happen
to
stumble
against
a
crust
,
and
fall
flat
on
my
face
,
but
receive
no
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
up
immediately
,
and
observe
the
good
people
to
be
in
much
concern
<EOS>
,
I
take
my
hat
(
which
I
hold
under
my
arm
out
of
good
manner
,
)
and
wave
it
over
my
head
,
make
three
huzza
,
to
show
I
have
get
no
mischief
by
my
fall
.
 
<EOS>
but
advance
forward
towards
my
master
(
as
I
shall
henceforth
call
him
,
)
<EOS>
his
young
son
,
who
sit
next
to
him
,
an
arch
boy
of
about
ten
year
old
,
take
me
up
by
the
leg
,
and
hold
me
so
high
in
the
air
,
that
I
tremble
every
limb
:
 
but
his
father
snatch
me
from
him
,
and
at
the
same
time
give
him
such
a
box
on
the
left
ear
,
as
would
have
fell
an
european
troop
of
horse
to
the
earth
,
order
him
to
be
take
from
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
but
be
afraid
the
boy
may
owe
me
a
spite
,
and
well
remember
how
mischievous
all
child
among
us
naturally
be
to
sparrow
,
rabbit
,
young
kitten
,
and
puppy
dog
,
I
fall
on
my
knee
,
and
point
to
the
boy
,
make
my
master
to
understand
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
that
I
desire
his
son
may
be
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
the
father
comply
,
and
the
lad
take
his
seat
again
,
<EOS>
whereupon
I
go
to
him
,
and
kiss
his
hand
,
which
my
master
take
,
and
make
him
stroke
me
gently
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
dinner
,
my
mistress
's
favourite
cat
leap
into
her
lap
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
a
noise
behind
me
like
that
of
a
dozen
stocking
-
weaver
at
work
;
and
turn
my
head
,
I
find
it
proceed
from
the
purring
of
that
animal
,
who
seem
to
be
three
time
large
than
an
ox
,
as
I
compute
by
the
view
of
her
head
,
and
one
of
her
paw
,
while
her
mistress
be
feed
and
stroke
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
fierceness
of
this
creature
's
countenance
altogether
discompose
me
;
though
I
stand
at
the
farther
end
of
the
table
,
above
fifty
foot
off
;
and
although
my
mistress
hold
her
fast
,
for
fear
she
may
give
a
spring
,
and
seize
me
in
her
talon
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
happen
there
be
no
danger
,
for
the
cat
take
not
the
least
notice
of
me
when
my
master
place
me
within
three
yard
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
I
have
be
always
tell
,
and
find
true
by
experience
in
my
travel
,
that
fly
or
discovering
fear
before
a
fierce
animal
,
be
a
certain
way
to
make
it
pursue
or
attack
you
,
<EOS>
so
I
resolve
,
in
this
dangerous
juncture
,
to
show
no
manner
of
concern
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
with
intrepidity
five
or
six
time
before
the
very
head
of
the
cat
,
and
come
within
half
a
yard
of
her
;
whereupon
she
draw
herself
back
,
as
if
she
be
more
afraid
of
me
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
less
apprehension
concern
the
dog
,
whereof
three
or
four
come
into
the
room
,
as
it
be
usual
in
farmer
'
house
;
one
of
which
be
a
mastiff
,
equal
in
bulk
to
four
elephant
,
and
another
a
greyhound
,
somewhat
tall
than
the
mastiff
,
but
not
so
large
.
  
<EOS>
when
dinner
be
almost
do
,
the
nurse
come
in
with
a
child
of
a
year
old
in
her
arm
,
who
immediately
spy
me
,
and
begin
a
squall
that
you
may
have
hear
from
London
-
Bridge
to
Chelsea
,
after
the
usual
oratory
of
infant
,
to
get
me
for
a
plaything
.
 
<EOS>
the
mother
,
out
of
pure
indulgence
,
take
me
up
,
and
put
me
towards
the
child
,
who
presently
seize
me
by
the
middle
,
and
get
my
head
into
his
mouth
,
where
I
roar
so
loud
that
the
urchin
be
fright
,
and
let
me
drop
,
and
I
should
infallibly
have
break
my
neck
,
if
the
mother
have
not
hold
her
apron
under
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
nurse
,
to
quiet
her
babe
,
make
use
of
a
rattle
which
be
a
kind
of
hollow
vessel
fill
with
great
stone
,
and
fasten
by
a
cable
to
the
child
's
waist
:
 
but
all
in
vain
;
so
that
she
be
force
to
apply
the
last
remedy
by
give
it
suck
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
confess
no
object
<EOS>
ever
disgust
me
so
much
as
the
sight
of
her
monstrous
breast
,
which
I
can
not
tell
what
to
compare
with
,
so
as
to
give
the
curious
reader
an
idea
of
its
bulk
,
shape
,
and
colour
.
 
<EOS>
It
stand
prominent
six
foot
,
and
could
not
be
less
than
sixteen
in
circumference
.
 
<EOS>
the
nipple
be
about
half
the
bigness
of
my
head
,
and
the
hue
both
of
that
and
the
dug
,
so
varied
with
spot
,
pimple
,
and
freckle
,
that
nothing
could
appear
more
nauseous
:
 
for
I
have
a
near
sight
of
her
,
she
sit
down
,
the
more
conveniently
to
give
suck
,
and
I
stand
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
this
make
me
reflect
upon
the
fair
skin
of
our
english
lady
,
who
appear
so
beautiful
to
us
,
only
because
they
be
of
our
own
size
,
and
their
defect
not
to
be
see
but
through
a
magnify
glass
;
where
we
find
by
experiment
that
the
smooth
and
whitest
skin
look
rough
,
and
coarse
,
and
ill
-
coloured
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
when
I
be
at
Lilliput
,
the
complexion
of
those
diminutive
people
appear
to
me
the
fair
in
the
world
;
and
talk
upon
this
subject
with
a
person
of
learn
there
,
who
be
an
intimate
friend
of
mine
,
he
say
that
my
face
appear
much
fair
and
smooth
when
he
look
on
me
from
the
ground
,
than
it
do
upon
a
nearer
view
,
when
I
take
him
up
in
my
hand
,
and
bring
him
close
,
which
he
confess
be
at
first
a
very
shocking
sight
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
he
could
discover
great
hole
in
my
skin
;
that
the
stump
of
my
beard
be
ten
time
strong
than
the
bristle
of
a
boar
,
and
my
complexion
make
up
of
several
colour
altogether
disagreeable
:
"
although
I
must
beg
leave
to
say
for
myself
,
that
I
be
as
fair
as
most
of
my
sex
and
country
,
and
very
little
sunburnt
by
all
my
travel
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
side
,
discourse
of
the
lady
in
that
emperor
's
court
,
he
use
to
tell
me
,
"
one
have
freckle
;
another
too
wide
a
mouth
;
a
third
too
large
a
nose
;
"
nothing
of
which
I
be
able
to
distinguish
.
 
<EOS>
I
confess
this
reflection
be
obvious
enough
;
which
,
however
,
I
could
not
forbear
,
lest
the
reader
may
think
those
vast
creature
be
actually
deform
:
for
I
must
do
them
the
justice
to
say
,
they
be
a
comely
race
of
people
,
and
particularly
the
feature
of
my
master
's
countenance
,
although
he
be
but
<EOS>
a
farmer
,
when
I
beheld
him
from
the
height
of
sixty
foot
,
appear
very
well
proportion
.
  
<EOS>
when
dinner
be
do
,
my
master
go
out
to
his
labourer
,
and
,
as
I
could
discover
by
his
voice
and
gesture
,
give
his
wife
strict
charge
to
take
care
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
tired
,
and
dispose
to
sleep
,
which
my
mistress
perceive
,
she
put
me
on
her
own
bed
,
and
cover
me
with
a
clean
white
handkerchief
,
but
large
and
coarse
than
the
mainsail
of
a
man
-
of
-
war
.
  
<EOS>
I
sleep
about
two
hour
,
and
dreamt
<EOS>
I
be
at
home
with
my
wife
and
child
,
which
aggravate
my
sorrow
when
I
awake
,
and
find
myself
alone
in
a
vast
room
,
between
two
and
three
hundred
foot
wide
,
and
above
two
hundred
high
,
lie
in
a
bed
twenty
yard
wide
.
<EOS>
My
mistress
be
go
about
her
household
affair
,
and
have
lock
me
in
.
 
<EOS>
the
bed
be
eight
yard
from
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
some
natural
necessity
require
me
to
get
down
;
I
durst
not
presume
to
call
;
and
if
I
have
,
it
would
have
be
in
vain
,
with
such
a
voice
as
mine
,
at
so
great
a
distance
from
the
room
where
I
lie
to
the
kitchen
where
the
family
keep
.
 
<EOS>
while
I
be
under
these
circumstance
,
two
rat
creep
up
the
curtain
,
and
run
smell
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
them
come
up
almost
to
my
face
,
whereupon
I
rise
in
a
fright
,
and
draw
out
my
hanger
to
defend
myself
.
 
<EOS>
these
horrible
animal
have
the
boldness
to
attack
me
on
both
side
,
and
one
of
them
hold
his
fore
-
foot
at
my
collar
;
but
I
have
the
good
fortune
to
rip
up
his
belly
before
he
could
do
me
any
mischief
.
 
<EOS>
He
fall
down
at
my
foot
;
and
the
other
,
see
the
fate
of
his
comrade
,
make
his
escape
,
but
not
without
one
good
wound
on
the
back
,
which
I
give
him
as
he
flee
,
and
make
the
blood
run
trickle
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
after
this
exploit
,
I
walk
gently
to
and
fro
on
the
bed
,
to
recover
my
breath
and
loss
of
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
these
creature
be
of
the
size
of
a
large
mastiff
,
but
infinitely
more
nimble
and
fierce
;
so
that
if
I
have
take
off
my
belt
before
I
go
to
sleep
,
I
must
have
infallibly
be
tear
to
piece
and
devour
.
<EOS>
I
measure
the
tail
of
the
dead
rat
,
and
find
it
to
be
two
yard
long
,
want
an
inch
;
but
it
go
against
my
stomach
to
drag
the
carcass
off
the
bed
,
where
it
lie
still
bleed
;
I
observe
it
have
yet
some
life
,
but
with
a
strong
slash
across
the
neck
,
I
thoroughly
despatch
it
.
  
<EOS>
soon
after
my
mistress
come
into
the
room
,
who
see
me
all
bloody
,
run
and
take
me
up
in
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
point
to
the
dead
rat
,
smile
,
and
make
other
sign
to
show
I
be
not
hurt
;
whereat
she
be
extremely
rejoice
,
call
the
maid
to
take
up
the
dead
rat
with
a
pair
of
tong
,
and
throw
it
out
of
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
set
me
on
a
table
,
where
I
show
her
my
hanger
all
bloody
,
and
wipe
it
on
the
lappet
of
my
coat
,
return
it
to
the
scabbard
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
press
to
do
more
than
one
thing
which
another
could
not
do
for
me
,
and
therefore
endeavour
to
make
my
mistress
understand
,
that
I
desire
to
be
set
down
on
the
floor
;
which
after
she
have
do
,
my
bashfulness
would
not
suffer
me
to
express
myself
farther
,
than
by
point
to
the
door
,
and
bow
several
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
good
woman
,
with
much
difficulty
,
at
last
perceive
what
I
would
be
at
,
and
take
me
up
again
in
her
hand
,
walk
into
the
garden
,
where
she
set
me
down
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
on
one
side
about
two
hundred
yard
,
and
beckon
to
her
not
to
look
or
to
follow
me
,
I
hide
myself
between
two
leave
of
sorrel
,
and
there
discharge
the
necessity
of
nature
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
the
gentle
reader
will
excuse
me
for
dwell
on
these
and
the
like
particular
,
which
,
however
insignificant
they
may
appear
to
grovel
vulgar
mind
,
yet
will
certainly
help
a
philosopher
to
enlarge
his
thought
and
imagination
,
and
apply
them
to
the
benefit
of
public
as
well
as
private
life
,
which
be
my
sole
design
in
present
this
and
other
account
of
my
travel
to
the
world
;
wherein
I
have
be
chiefly
studious
of
truth
,
without
affect
any
ornament
of
learning
or
of
style
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
whole
scene
of
this
voyage
make
so
strong
an
impression
on
my
mind
,
and
be
so
deeply
fix
in
my
memory
,
that
,
in
commit
it
to
paper
I
do
not
omit
one
material
circumstance
:
 
however
,
upon
a
strict
review
,
I
blot
out
several
passage
.
 
<EOS>
of
less
moment
which
be
in
my
first
copy
,
for
fear
of
be
censure
as
tedious
and
trifling

whereof
traveller

often

perhaps
not
without

accuse

<EOS>
the
particular
of
his
journey

<EOS>
My
mistress
have
a
daughter
of
nine
year
old
,
a
child
of
towardly
part
for
her
age
,
very
dexterous
at
her
needle

and
skilful
in
dress
her
baby

<EOS>
Her
mother
and
she
contrive
to
fit
up
the
baby
's
cradle
for
me
against
night
:
 
<EOS>
the

into
a
small
drawer
of
a
cabinet
,
and
the
drawer
place
upon
a

shelf
for
fear
of
the
rat

<EOS>
this
be
my
bed
all
the
time
I
staid
with
those
people
,
though
make
more
convenient
by
degree
,
as
I
begin
to
learn
their
language
and
make
my
want
know
.
 
<EOS>
this
young
girl
be
so
handy
,
that
after
I
have
once
or
twice
pull
off
my
clothe
before
her
,
she
be
able
to
dress
and
undress
me
,
though
I
never
give
her
that
trouble
when
she
would
let
me
do
either
myself
.
<EOS>
She
make
me
seven
shirt
,
and
some
other
linen
,
of
as
fine
cloth
as
could
be
get
,
which
indeed
be
coarse
than
sackcloth
;
and
these
she
constantly
wash
for
me
with
her
own
hand
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
likewise
my
school
-
mistress
,
to
teach
me
the
language
:
 
when
I
point
to
any
thing
,
she
tell
me
the
name
of
it
in
her
own
tongue
,
so
that
in
a
few
day
I
be
able
to
call
for
whatever
I
have
a
mind
to
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
very
good
-
natured
,
and
not
above
forty
foot
high
,
be
little
for
her
age
.
 
<EOS>
She
give
me
the
name
of
Grildrig
,
which
the
family
take
up
,
and
afterwards
the
whole
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
the
word
import
<EOS>
what
the
latin
call
nanunculus
,
the
Italians
homunceletino
,
and
the
english
mannikin
.
 
<EOS>
to
her
<EOS>
I
chiefly
owe
my
preservation
in
that
country
:
 
<EOS>
we
never
part
while
I
be
there
;
I
call
her
my
glumdalclitch
,
or
little
nurse
;
and
should
be
guilty
of
great
ingratitude
,
if
I
omit
this
honourable
mention
of
her
care
and
affection
towards
me
,
which
I
heartily
wish
it
lie
in
my
power
to
requite
as
she
deserve
,
instead
of
be
the
innocent
,
but
unhappy
instrument
of
her
disgrace
,
as
I
have
too
much
reason
to
fear
.
  
<EOS>
It
now
begin
to
be
know
and
talk
of
in
the
neighbourhood
,
that
my
master
have
find
a
strange
animal
in
the
field
,
about
the
bigness
of
a
splacnuck
,
but
exactly
shape
in
every
part
like
a
human
creature
;
which
it
likewise
imitate
in
all
its
action
;
seem
to
speak
in
a
little
language
of
its
own
,
have
already
learn
several
word
of
theirs
,
go
erect
upon
two
leg
,
be
tame
and
gentle
,
would
come
when
it
be
call
,
do
whatever
it
be
bid
,
have
the
fine
limb
in
the
world
,
and
a
complexion
fair
than
a
nobleman
's
daughter
of
three
year
old
.
 
<EOS>
another
farmer
,
who
live
hard
by
,
and
be
a
particular
friend
of
my
master
,
come
on
a
visit
on
purpose
to
inquire
into
the
truth
of
this
story
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
immediately
produce
,
and
place
upon
a
table
,
where
I
walk
as
I
be
command
,
draw
my
hanger
,
put
it
up
again
,
make
my
reverence
to
my
master
's
guest
,
ask
him
in
his
own
language
how
he
do
,
and
tell
him
he
be
WELCOME
,
just
as
my
little
nurse
have
instruct
me
.
<EOS>
this
man
,
who
be
old
and
dim
-
sighted
,
put
on
his
spectacle
to
behold
me
better
;
at
which
I
could
not
forbear
laugh
very
heartily
,
for
his
eye
appear
like
the
full
moon
shine
into
a
chamber
at
two
window
.
 
<EOS>
Our
people
,
who
discover
the
cause
of
my
mirth
,
bear
me
company
in
laughing
,
at
which
the
old
fellow
be
fool
enough
to
be
angry
and
out
of
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
the
character
of
a
great
miser
;
and
,
to
my
misfortune
,
he
well
deserve
it
,
by
the
cursed
advice
he
give
my
master
,
to
show
me
as
a
sight
upon
a
market
-
day
in
the
next
town
,
which
be
half
an
hour
's
riding
,
about
two
-
and
-
twenty
mile
from
our
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
guess
there
be
some
mischief
when
I
observe
my
master
and
his
friend
whisper
together
,
sometimes
point
at
me
;
and
my
fear
make
me
fancy
that
I
overhear
and
understand
some
of
their
word
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
next
morning
glumdalclitch
,
my
little
nurse
,
tell
me
the
whole
matter
,
which
she
have
cunningly
pick
out
from
her
mother
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
girl
lay
me
on
her
bosom
,
and
fall
a
weeping
with
shame
and
grief
.
 
<EOS>
She
apprehend
some
mischief
would
happen
to
me
from
rude
vulgar
folk
,
who
may
squeeze
me
to
death
,
or
break
one
of
my
limb
by
take
me
in
their
hand
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
also
observe
how
modest
I
be
in
my
nature
<EOS>
,
how
nicely
I
regard
my
honour
,
and
what
an
indignity
I
should
conceive
it
,
to
be
expose
for
money
as
a
public
spectacle
,
to
the
mean
of
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
,
her
papa
and
mamma
have
promise
that
Grildrig
should
be
hers
;
but
now
she
find
they
mean
to
serve
her
as
they
do
last
year
,
when
they
pretend
to
give
her
a
lamb
,
and
yet
,
as
soon
as
it
be
fat
,
sell
it
to
a
butcher
.
 
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
may
truly
affirm
,
that
I
be
less
concerned
than
my
nurse
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
strong
hope
,
which
never
leave
me
,
that
I
should
one
day
recover
my
liberty
:
 
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
ignominy
of
be
carry
about
for
a
monster
,
I
consider
myself
to
be
a
perfect
stranger
in
the
country
,
and
that
such
a
misfortune
could
never
be
charge
upon
me
as
a
reproach
,
if
ever
I
should
return
to
England
,
since
the
king
of
Great
Britain
himself
,
in
my
condition
,
must
have
undergo
the
same
distress
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
,
pursuant
to
the
advice
of
his
friend
,
carry
me
in
a
box
the
next
market
-
day
to
the
neighbouring
town
,
and
take
along
with
him
his
little
daughter
,
my
nurse
,
upon
a
pillion
behind
him
.
<EOS>
the
box
be
close
on
every
side
,
with
a
little
door
for
me
to
go
in
and
out
,
and
a
few
gimlet
hole
to
let
in
air
.
 
<EOS>
the
girl
have
be
so
careful
as
to
put
the
quilt
of
her
baby
's
bed
into
it
,
for
me
to
lie
down
on
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
be
terribly
shaken
and
discompose
in
this
journey
,
though
it
be
but
of
half
an
hour
:
 
for
the
horse
<EOS>
go
about
forty
foot
at
every
step
and
trot
so
high
,
that
the
agitation
be
equal
to
the
rise
and
fall
of
a
ship
in
a
great
storm
,
but
much
more
frequent
.
 
<EOS>
Our
journey
be
somewhat
farth
than
from
London
to
St.
Alban
's
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
alight
at
an
inn
which
he
use
to
frequent
;
and
after
consult
awhile
with
the
inn
-
keeper
,
and
make
some
necessary
preparation
,
he
hire
the
grultrud
,
or
cri
,
to
give
notice
through
the
town
of
a
strange
creature
to
be
see
at
the
sign
of
the
Green
Eagle
,
not
so
big
as
a
splacnuck
(
an
animal
in
that
country
very
finely
shape
,
about
six
foot
long
,
)
and
in
every
part
of
the
body
resemble
a
human
creature
,
could
speak
several
word
,
and
perform
a
hundred
divert
trick
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
place
upon
a
table
in
the
large
room
of
the
inn
,
which
may
be
near
three
hundred
foot
square
.
 
<EOS>
My
little
nurse
stand
on
a
low
stool
close
to
the
table
,
to
take
care
of
me
,
and
direct
what
I
should
do
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
,
to
avoid
a
crowd
,
would
suffer
only
thirty
people
at
a
time
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
about
on
the
table
as
the
girl
command
;
she
ask
me
question
,
as
far
as
she
know
my
understanding
of
the
language
reach
,
and
I
answer
them
as
loud
as
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
I
turn
about
several
time
to
the
company
,
pay
my
humble
respect
,
say
they
be
welcome
,
and
use
some
other
speech
I
have
be
teach
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
up
a
thimble
fill
with
liquor
,
which
Glumdalclitch
have
give
me
for
a
cup
,
and
drank
their
health
,
I
draw
out
my
hanger
,
and
flourish
with
it
after
the
manner
of
fencer
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
My
nurse
give
me
a
part
of
a
straw
,
which
I
exercise
as
a
pike
,
have
learn
the
art
in
my
youth
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
that
day
show
to
twelve
set
of
company
,
and
as
often
force
to
act
over
again
the
same
fopperie
,
till
I
be
half
dead
with
weariness
and
vexation
;
for
those
who
have
see
me
make
such
wonderful
report
,
that
the
people
be
ready
to
break
down
the
door
to
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
,
for
his
own
interest
,
would
not
suffer
any
one
to
touch
me
except
my
nurse
;
and
to
prevent
danger
,
bench
be
set
round
the
table
at
such
a
distance
as
to
put
me
out
of
every
body
's
reach
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
an
unlucky
school
-
boy
aim
a
hazel
nut
directly
at
my
head
,
which
very
narrowly
miss
me
;
otherwise
it
come
with
so
much
violence
,
that
it
would
have
infallibly
knock
out
my
brain
,
for
it
be
almost
as
large
as
a
small
pumpkin
,
but
I
have
the
satisfaction
to
see
the
young
rogue
well
beat
,
and
turn
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
give
public
notice
that
he
would
show
me
again
the
next
market
-
day
;
and
in
the
meantime
he
prepare
a
convenient
vehicle
for
me
,
which
he
have
reason
enough
to
do
;
for
I
be
so
tired
with
my
first
journey
,
and
with
entertaining
company
for
eight
hour
together
,
that
I
could
hardly
stand
upon
my
leg
,
or
speak
a
word
.
<EOS>
It
be
at
least
three
day
before
I
recover
my
strength
;
and
that
I
may
have
no
rest
at
home
,
all
the
neighbour
gentleman
from
a
hundred
mile
round
,
hearing
of
my
fame
,
come
to
see
me
at
my
master
's
own
house
.
 
<EOS>
there
could
not
be
few
than
thirty
person
with
their
wife
and
child
<EOS>
(
for
the
country
be
very
populous
;
)
and
my
master
demand
the
rate
of
a
full
room
whenever
he
show
me
at
home
,
although
it
be
only
to
a
single
family
;
so
that
for
some
time
I
have
but
<EOS>
little
ease
every
day
of
the
week
(
except
Wednesday
,
which
be
their
Sabbath
,
)
although
I
be
not
carry
to
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
,
find
how
profitable
I
be
likely
to
be
,
resolve
to
carry
me
to
the
most
considerable
city
of
the
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
have
therefore
provide
himself
with
all
thing
necessary
for
a
long
journey
,
and
settle
his
affair
at
home
,
he
take
leave
of
his
wife
,
and
upon
the
17th
of
August
,
1703
,
about
two
month
after
my
arrival
,
we
set
out
for
the
metropolis
,
situate
near
the
middle
of
that
empire
,
and
about
three
thousand
mile
distance
from
our
house
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
make
his
daughter
glumdalclitch
ride
behind
him
.
<EOS>
She
carry
me
on
her
lap
,
in
a
box
tie
about
her
waist
.
 
<EOS>
the
girl
have
line
it
on
all
side
with
the
soft
cloth
she
could
get
,
well
quilt
underneath
,
furnish
it
with
her
baby
's
bed
,
provide
me
with
linen
and
other
necessary
,
and
make
everything
as
convenient
as
she
could
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
no
other
company
but
a
boy
of
the
house
,
who
ride
after
us
with
the
luggage
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
's
design
be
to
show
me
in
all
the
town
by
the
way
,
and
to
step
out
of
the
road
for
fifty
or
a
hundred
mile
,
to
any
village
,
or
person
of
quality
's
house
,
where
he
may
expect
custom
.
 
<EOS>
We
make
easy
journey
,
of
not
above
seven
or
eight
score
mile
a

day
;
for
Glumdalclitch
,
on
purpose
to
spare
me
,
complain
she
be
tired
with
the
trotting
of
the
horse
.
 
<EOS>
She
often
take
me
out
of
my
box
,
at
my
own
desire
,
to
give
me
air
,
and
show
me
the
country
,
but
always
hold
me
fast
by
a
lead
-
string
.
 
<EOS>
We
pass
over
five
or
six
river
,
many
degree
broad
and
deep
than
the
Nile
or
the
gange
:
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
hardly
a
rivulet
so
small
as
the
Thames
at
London
-
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
ten
week
in
our
journey
,
and
I
be
show
in
eighteen
large
town
,
besides
many
village

and
private
family
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
26th
day
of
October
we
arrive
at
the
metropolis
,
call
in
their
language
Lorbrulgrud
,
or
Pride
of
the
Universe
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
take
a
lodging
in
the
principal

<EOS>
He

a

,
upon
which
I
be

act
my

,
and
pallisadoe

round
three
foot

I

to
the
wonder
and
satisfaction
of
all

I

tolerably
well
,
and
perfectly
understand
every

that
be

<EOS>
besides
,
I
have

I
must
soon
die
,
resolve
to
make
as
good
a
hand
of
me
as
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
while
he
be
thus
reason
and
resolve
with
himself
,
a
sardral
,
or
gentleman
-
usher
,
come
from
court
,
command
my
master
to
carry
me
immediately
thither
for
the
diversion
of
the
queen
and
her
lady
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
the
latter
have
already
be
to
see
me
,
and
report
strange
thing
of
my
beauty
,
behaviour
,
and
good
sense
.
 
<EOS>
Her
majesty
,
and
those
who
attend
her
,
be
beyond
measure
delighted
with
my
demeanour
.
 
<EOS>
I
fall
on
my
knee
,
and
beg
the
honour
of
kiss
her
imperial
foot
;
but
this
gracious
princess
hold
out
her
little
finger
towards
me
,
after
I
be
set
on
the
table
,
which
I
embrace
in
both
my
arm
,
and
put
the
tip
of
it
with
the
utmost
respect
to
my
lip
.
 
<EOS>
She
make
me
some
general
question
about
my
country
and
my
travel
,
which
I
answer
as
distinctly
,
and
in
as
few
word
as
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
She
ask
,
"
whether
I
could
be
content
to
live
at
court
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
bow
down
to
the
board
of
the
table
,
and
humbly
answer
"
that
I
be
my
master
's
slave
:
 
<EOS>
but
,
if
I
be
at
my
own
disposal
,
I
should
be
proud
to
devote
my
life
to
her
majesty
's
service
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
then
ask
my
master
,
"
whether
he
be
willing
to
sell
me
at
a
good
price
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
,
who
apprehend
I
could
not
live
a
month
,
be
ready
enough
to
part
with
me
,
and
demand
a
thousand
piece
of
gold
,
which
be
order
him
on
the
spot
,
each
piece
be
about
the
bigness
of
eight
hundred
moidore
;
but
allow
for
the
proportion
of
all
thing
between
that
country
and
Europe
,
and
the
high
price
of
gold
among
them
,
be
hardly
so
great
a
sum
as
a
thousand
guinea
would
be
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
say
to
the
queen
,
"
since
I
be
now
her
majesty
's
most
humble
creature
and
vassal
,
I
must
beg
the
favour
,
that
Glumdalclitch
,
who
have
always
tend
me
with
so
much
care
and
kindness
,
and
understand
to
do
it
so
well
,
may
be
admit
into
her
service
,
and
continue
to
be
my
nurse
and
instructor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
majesty
agree
to
my
petition
,
and
easily
get
the
farmer
's
consent
,
who
be
glad
enough
to
have
his
daughter
prefer
at
court
,
and
the
poor
girl
herself
be
not
able
to
hide
her
joy
.
 
<EOS>
My
late
master
withdraw
,
bid
me
farewell
,
and
say
he
have
leave
me
in
a
good
service
;
to
which
I
reply
not
a
word
,
only
make
him
a
slight
bow
.
  
<EOS>
the
queen
observe
my
coldness
;
and
,
when
the
farmer
be
go
out
of
the
apartment
,
ask
me
the
reason
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
bold
to
tell
her
majesty
,
"
that
I
owe
no
other
obligation
to
my
late
master
,
than
his
not
dash
out
the
brain
of
a
poor
harmless
creature
,
find
by
chance
in
his
field
:
 
which
obligation
be
amply
recompense
,
by
the
gain
he
have
make
in
show
me
through
half
the
kingdom
,
and
the
price
he
have
now
sell
me
for
.
 
<EOS>
that
the
life
I
have
since
lead
be
laborious
enough
to
kill
an
animal
of
ten
time
my
strength
.
<EOS>
that
my
health
be
much
impair
,
by
the
continual
drudgery
of
entertain
the
rabble
every
hour
of
the
day
;
and
that
,
if
my
master
have
not
think
my
life
in
danger
,
her
majesty
would
not
have
get
so
cheap
a
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
I
be
out
of
all
fear
of
be
ill
-
treat
under
the
protection
of
so
great
and
good
an
empress
,
the
ornament
of
nature
,
the
darling
of
the
world
,
the
delight
of
her
subject
,
the
phoenix
of
the
creation
,
so
I
hope
my
late
master
's
apprehension
would
appear
to
be
groundless
;
for
I
already
find
my
spirit
revive
,
by
the
influence
of
her
most
august
presence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
sum
of
my
speech
,
deliver
with
great
impropriety
and
hesitation
.
 
<EOS>
the
latter
part
be
altogether
frame
in
the
style
peculiar
to
that
people
,
whereof
I
learn
some
phrase
from
Glumdalclitch
,
while
she
be
carry
me
to
court
.
  
<EOS>
the
queen
,
give
great
allowance
for
my
defectiveness
in
speak
,
be
,
however
,
surprised
at
so
much
wit
and
good
sense
in
so
diminutive
an
animal
.
 
<EOS>
She
take
me
in
her
own
hand
,
and
carry
me
to
the
king
,
who
be
then
retire
to
his
cabinet
.
 
<EOS>
His
majesty
,
a
prince
of
much
gravity
and
austere
countenance
,
not
well
observe
my
shape
at
first
view
,
ask
the
queen
after
a
cold
manner
"
how
long
it
be
since
she
grow
fond
of
a
splacnuck
?
"
<EOS>
for
such
it
seem
he
take
me
to
be
,
as
I
lay
upon
my
breast
in
her
majesty
's
right
hand
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
princess
,
who
have
an
infinite
deal
of
wit
and
humour
,
set
me
gently
on
my
foot
upon
the
scrutoire
,
and
command
me
to
give
his
majesty
an
account
of
myself
,
which
I
do
in
a
very
few
word
:
 
and
Glumdalclitch
who
attend
at
the
cabinet
door
,
and
could
not
endure
I
should
be
out
of
her
sight
,
be
admit
,
confirm
all
that
have
pass
from
my
arrival
at
her
father
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
king
,
although
he
be
as
learn
a
person
as
any
in
his
dominion
,
have
be
educate
in
the
study
of
philosophy
,
and
particularly
mathematic
;
yet
when
he
observe
my
shape
exactly
,
and
see
me
walk
erect
,
before
I
begin
to
speak
,
conceive
I
may
be
a
piece
of
clock
-
work
(
which
be
in
that
country
arrive
to
a
very
great
perfection
)
contrive
by
some
ingenious
artist
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
he
hear
my
voice
,
and
find
what
I
deliver
to
be
regular
and
rational
,
he
could
not
conceal
his
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
by
no
mean
satisfied
with
the
relation
I
give
him
of
the
manner
I
come
into
his
kingdom
,
but
think
it
a
story
concert
between
Glumdalclitch
and
her
father
,
who
have
teach
me
a
set
of
word
to
make
me
sell
at
a
well
price
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
imagination
,
he
put
several
other
question
to
me
,
and
still
receive
rational
answer
:
no
otherwise
defective
than
by
a
foreign
accent
,
and
an
imperfect
knowledge
in
the
language
,
with
some
rustic
phrase
which
I
have
learn
at
the
farmer
's
house
,
and
do
not
suit
the
polite
style
of
a
court
.
  
<EOS>
His
majesty
send
for
three
great
scholar
,
who
be
then
in
their
weekly
waiting
,
accord
to
the
custom
in
that
country
.
 
<EOS>
these
gentleman
,
after
they
have
a
while
examine
my
shape
with
much
nicety
,
be
of
different
opinion
concern
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
agree
that
I
could
not
be
produce
accord
to
the
regular
law
of
nature
,
because
I
be
not
frame
with
a
capacity
of
preserve
my
life
,
either
by
swiftness
,
or
climbing
of
tree
,
or
dig
hole
in
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
They
observe
by
my
tooth
,
which
they
view
with
great
exactness
,
that
I
be
a
carnivorous
animal
;
yet
most
quadruped
be
an
overmatch
for
me
,
and
field
mouse
,
with
some
other
,
too
nimble
,
they
could
not
imagine
how
I
should
be
able
to
support
myself
,
unless
I
feed
upon
snail
and
other
insect
,
which
they
offer
,
by
many
learn
argument
,
to
evince
that
I
could
not
possibly
do
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
these
virtuosi
seem
to
think
that
I
may
be
an
embryo
,
or
abortive
birth
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
opinion
be
reject
by
the
other
two
,
who
observe
my
limb
to
be
perfect
and
finish
;
and
that
I
have
live
several
year
,
as
it
be
manifest
from
my
beard
<EOS>
,
the
stump
whereof
they
plainly
discover
through
a
magnify
glass
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
not
allow
me
to
be
a
dwarf
,
because
my
littleness
be
beyond
all
degree
of
comparison
;
for
the
queen
's
favourite
dwarf
,
the
small
ever
know
in
that
kingdom
,
be
near
thirty
foot
high
.
 
<EOS>
after
much
debate
,
they
conclude
unanimously
,
that
I
be
only
relplum
scalcath
,
which
be
interpret
literally
lusu
naturae
;
a
determination
exactly
agreeable
to
the
modern
philosophy
of
Europe
,
<EOS>
whose
professor
,
disdain
the
old
evasion
of
occult
cause
,
whereby
the
follower
of
Aristotle
endeavour
in
vain
to
disguise
their
ignorance
,
have
invent
this
wonderful
solution
of
all
difficulty
,
to
the
unspeakable
advancement
of
human
knowledge
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
decisive
conclusion
,
I
entreat
to
be
hear
a
word
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
I
apply
myself
to
the
king
,
and
assure
his
majesty
,
"
that
I
come
from
a
country
which
abound
with
several
million
of
both
sex
,
and
of
my
own
stature
;
where
the
animal
,
tree
,
and
house
,
be
all
in
proportion
,
and
where
,
by
consequence
,
I
may
be
as
able
to
defend
myself
,
and
to
find
sustenance
,
as
any
of
his
majesty
's
subject
could
do
here
;
which
I
take
for
a
full
answer
to
those
gentleman
's
argument
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
to
this
they
only
reply
with
a
smile
of
contempt
,
say
,
"
that
the
farmer
have
instruct
me
very
well
in
my
lesson
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
king
,
who
have
a
much
well
understanding
,
dismiss
his
learned
man
,
send
for
the
farmer
,
who
by
good
fortune
be
not
yet
go
out
of
town
.
 
<EOS>
have
therefore
first
examine
him
privately
,
and
then
confront
him
with
me
and
the
young
girl
,
his
majesty
begin
to
think
that
what
we
tell
him
may
possibly
be
true
.
<EOS>
He
desire
the
queen
to
order
that
a
particular
care
should
be
take
of
me
;
and
be
of
opinion
that
Glumdalclitch
should
still
continue
in
her
office
of
tend
me
,
because
he
observe
we
have
a
great
affection
for
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
a
convenient
apartment
be
provide
for
her
at
court
:
 
<EOS>
she
have
a
sort
of
governess
appoint
to
take
care
of
her
education
,
a
maid
to
dress
her
,
and
two
other
servant
for
menial
office
;
but
the
care
of
me
be
wholly
appropriate
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
the
queen
command
her
own
cabinet
-
maker
to
contrive
a
box
,
that
may
serve
me
for
a
bedchamber
,
after
the
model
that
Glumdalclitch
and
I
should
agree
upon
.
 
<EOS>
this
man
be
a
most
ingenious
artist
,
and
accord
to
my
direction
,
in
three
week
finish
for
me
a
wooden
chamber
of
sixteen
foot
square
,
and
twelve
high
,
with
sash
-
window
,
a
door
,
and
two
closet
,
like
a
London
bed
-
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
the
board
,
that
make
the
ceiling
,
be
to
be
lift
up
and
down
by
two
hinge
,
to
put
in
a
bed
ready
furnish
by
her
majesty
's
upholsterer
,
which
Glumdalclitch
take
out
every
day
to
air
,
make
it
with
her
own
hand
,
and
let
it
down
at
night
,
lock
up
the
roof
over
me
.
 
<EOS>
a
nice
workman
,
who
be
famous
for
little
curiosity
,
undertake
to
make
me
two
chair
,
with
back
and
frame
,
of
a
substance
not
unlike
ivory
,
and
two
table
,
with
a
cabinet
to
put
my
thing
in
.
<EOS>
the
room
be
quilt
on
all
side
,
as
well
as
the
floor
and
the
ceiling
,
to
prevent
any
accident
from
the
carelessness
of
those
who
carry
me
,
and
to
break
the
force
of
a
jolt
,
when
I
go
in
a
coach
.
 
<EOS>
I
desire
a
lock
for
my
door
,
to
prevent
rat
and
mouse
from
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
the
smith
,
after
several
attempt
,
make
the
small
that
ever
be
see
among
them
,
for
I
have
know
a
large
at
the
gate
of
a
gentleman
's
house
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
a
shift
to
keep
the
key
in
a
pocket
of
my
own
,
fear
Glumdalclitch
may
lose
it
.
<EOS>
the
queen
likewise
order
the
thin
silk
that
could
be
get
,
to
make
me
clothe
,
not
much
thick
than
an
english
blanket
,
very
cumbersome
till
I
be
accustomed
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
after
the
fashion
of
the
kingdom
,
partly
resemble
the
Persian
,
and
partly
the
Chinese
,
and
be
a
very
grave
and
decent
habit
.
  
<EOS>
the
queen
become
so
fond
of
my
company
,
that
she
could
not
dine
without
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
table
place
upon
the
same
at
which
her
majesty
eat
,
just
at
her
left
elbow
,
and
a
chair
to
sit
on
.
<EOS>
glumdalclitch
stand
on
a
stool
on
the
floor
near
my
table
,
to
assist
and
take
care
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
an
entire
set
of
silver
dish
and
plate
,
and
other
necessary
,
which
,
in
proportion
to
those
of
the
queen
,
be
not
much
big
than
what
I
have
see
in
a
London
toy
-
shop
for
the
furniture
of
a
baby
-
house
:
 
<EOS>
these
my
little
nurse
keep
in
her
pocket
in
a
silver
box
,
and
give
me
at
meal
as
I
want
them
,
always
clean
them
herself
.
 
<EOS>
no
person
dine
with
the
queen
but
the
two
princess
royal
,
the
eld
sixteen
year
old
,
and
the
young
at
that
time
thirteen
and
a
month
.
 
<EOS>
Her
majesty
use
to
put
a
bit
of
meat
upon
one
of
my
dish
,
out
of
which
I
carve
for
myself
,
and
her
diversion
be
to
see
me
eat
in
miniature
:
 
for
the
queen
(
who
have
indeed
but
a
weak
stomach
)
<EOS>
take
up
,
at
one
mouthful
,
as
much
as
a
dozen
english
farmer
could
eat
at
a
meal
,
which
to
me
be
for
some
time
a
very
nauseous
sight
.
<EOS>
She
would
craunch
the
wing
of
a
lark
,
bone
and
all
,
between
her
tooth
,
although
it
be
nine
time
as
large
as
that
of
a
full
-
grown
turkey
;
and
put
a
bit
of
bread
into
her
mouth
as
big
as
two
twelve
-
penny
loaf
.
 
<EOS>
She
drink
out
of
a
golden
cup
,
above
a
hogshead
at
a
draught
.
 
<EOS>
Her
knife
be
twice
as
long
as
a
scythe
,
set
straight
upon
the
handle
.
 
<EOS>
the
spoon
,
fork
,
and
other
instrument
,
be
all
in
the
same
proportion
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
when
Glumdalclitch
carry
me
,
out
of
curiosity
,
to
see
some
of
the
table
at
court
,
where
ten
or
a
dozen
of
those
enormous
knife
and
fork
be
lift
up
together
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
have
never
till
then
beheld
so
terrible
a
sight
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
custom
,
that
every
Wednesday
(
which
,
as
I
have
observe
,
be
their
Sabbath
)
the
king
and
queen
,
with
the
royal
issue
of
both
sex
,
dine
together
in
the
apartment
of
his
majesty
,
to
whom
I
be
now
become
a
great
favourite
;
and
at
these
time
,
my
little
chair
and
table
be
place
at
his
left
hand
,
before
one
of
the
salt
-
cellar
.
<EOS>
this
prince
take
a
pleasure
in
converse
with
me
,
inquire
into
the
manner
,
religion
,
law
,
government
,
and
learning
of
Europe
;
wherein
I
give
him
the
good
account
I
be
able
.
<EOS>
His
apprehension
be
so
clear
,
and
his
judgment
so
exact
,
that
he
make
very
wise
reflection
and
observation
upon
all
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
confess
,
that
,
after
I
have
be
a
little
too
copious
in
talking
of
my
own
beloved
country
,
of
our
trade
and
war
by
sea
and
land
,
of
our
schism
in
religion
,
and
party
in
the
state
;
the
prejudice
of
his
education
prevail
so
far
,
that
he
could
not
forbear
take
me
up
in
his
right
hand
,
and
stroke
me
gently
with
the
other
,
after
a
hearty
fit
of
laughing
,
ask
me
,
"
whether
I
be
a
whig
or
tory
?
"
 
<EOS>
then
turn
to
his
first
minister
,
who
wait
behind
him
with
a
white
staff
,
near
as
tall
as
the
mainmast
of
the
Royal
Sovereign
,
he
observe
"
how
contemptible
a
thing
be
human
grandeur
,
which
could
be
mimic
by
such
diminutive
insect
as
I
:
and
yet
,
"
say
he
,
<EOS>
"
I
dare
engage
these
creature
have
their
title
and
distinction
of
honour
;
they
contrive
little
nest
and
burrow
,
that
they
call
house
and
city
;
they
make
a
figure
in
dress
and
equipage
;
they
love
,
they
fight
<EOS>
,
they
dispute
,
they
cheat
,
they
betray
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
thus
he
continue
on
,
while
my
colour
come
and
go
several
time
,
with
indignation
,
to
hear
our
noble
country
,
the
mistress
of
art
and
arm
,
the
scourge
of
France
,
the
arbitress
of
Europe
,
the
seat
of
virtue
,
piety
,
honour
,
and
truth
,
the
pride
and
envy
of
the
world
,
so
contemptuously
treat
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
I
be
not
in
a
condition
to
resent
injury
,
so
upon
mature
thought
I
begin
to
doubt
whether
I
be
injure
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
after
have
be
accustom
several
month
to
the
sight
and
converse
of
this
people
,
and
observe
every
object
upon
which
I
cast
mine
eye
to
be
of
proportionable
magnitude
,
the
horror
I
have
at
first
conceive
from
their
bulk
and
aspect
be
so
far
wear
off
,
that
if
I
have
then
beheld
a
company
of
english
lord
and
lady
in
their
finery
and
birth
-
day
clothe
,
act
their
several
part
in
the
most
courtly
manner
of
strut
,
and
bowing
,
and
prate
,
to
say
the
truth
,
I
should
have
be
strongly
tempt
to
laugh
as
much
at
them
as
the
king
and
his
grandee
do
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
neither
,
indeed
,
could
I
forbear
smile
at
myself
,
when
the
queen
use
to
place
me
upon
her
hand
towards
a
looking
-
glass
,
by
which
both
our
person
appear
before
me
in
full
view
together
;
and
there
could
be
nothing
more
ridiculous
than
the
comparison
;
so
that
I
really
begin
to
imagine
myself
dwindle
many
degree
below
my
usual
size
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
angered
and
mortify
me
so
much
as
the
queen
's
dwarf
;
who
be
of
the
low
stature
that
be
ever
in
that
country
<EOS>
(
for
I
verily
think
he
be
not
full
thirty
foot
high
)
,
become
so
insolent
at
see
a
creature
so
much
beneath
him
,
that
he
would
always
affect
to
swagger
and
look
big
as
he
pass
by
me
in
the
queen
's
antechamber
,
while
I
be
stand
on
some
table
talk
with
the
lord
or
lady
of
the
court
,
and
he
seldom
fail
of
a
smart
word
or
two
upon
my
littleness
;
against
which
I
could
only
revenge
myself
by
call
him
brother
,
challenge
him
to
wrestle
,
and
such
repartee
as
be
usually
in
the
mouth
of
court
page
.
 
<EOS>
one
day
,
at
dinner
,
this
malicious
little
cub
be
so
nettle
with
something
I
have
say
to
him
,
that
,
raise
himself
upon
the
frame
of
her
majesty
's
chair
,
he
take
me
up
by
the
middle
,
as
I
be
sit
down
,
not
think
any
harm
,
and
let
me
drop
into
a
large
silver
bowl
of
cream
,
and
then
run
away
as
fast
as
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
I
fall
over
head
and
ear
,
and
,
if
I
have
not
be
a
good
swimmer
,
it
may
have
go
very
hard
with
me
;
for
Glumdalclitch
in
that
instant
happen
to
be
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
and
the
queen
be
in
such
a
fright
,
that
she
want
presence
of
mind
to
assist
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
little
nurse
run
to
my
relief
,
and
take
me
out
,
after
I
have
swallow
above
a
quart
of
cream
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
put
to
bed
:
 
however
<EOS>
,
I
receive
no
other
damage
than
the
loss
of
a
suit
of
clothe
,
which
be
utterly
spoil
.
 
<EOS>
the
dwarf
be
soundly
whipt
,
and
as
a
farth
punishment
,
force
to
drink
up
the
bowl
of
cream
into
which
he
have
throw
me
:
 
<EOS>
neither
be
he
ever
restore
to
favour
;
for
soon
after
the
queen
bestow
him
on
a
lady
of
high
quality
,
so
that
I
see
him
no
more
,
to
my
very
great
satisfaction
;
for
I
could
not
tell
to
what
extremity
such
a
malicious
urchin
may
have
carry
his
resentment
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
before
serve
me
a
scurvy
trick
,
which
set
the
queen
a
-
laughing
,
although
at
the
same
time
she
be
heartily
vexed
,
and
would
have
immediately
cashier
him
,
if
I
have
not
be
so
generous
as
to
intercede
.
 
<EOS>
Her
majesty
have
take
a
marrow
-
bone
upon
her
plate
,
and
,
after
knock
out
the
marrow
,
place
the
bone
again
in
the
dish
erect
,
as
it
stand
before
;
the
dwarf
,
watch
his
opportunity
,
while
glumdalclitch
be
go
to
the
side
-
board
,
mount
the
stool
that
she
stand
on
to
take
care
of
me
at
meal
,
take
me
up
in
both
hand
,
and
squeeze
my
leg
together
,
wedge
them
into
the
marrow
bone
above
my
waist
,
where
I
stick
for
some
time
,
and
make
a
very
ridiculous
figure
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
it
be
near
a
minute
before
any
one
know
what
be
become
of
me
;
for
I
think
it
below
me
to
cry
out
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
prince
seldom
get
their
meat
hot
,
my
leg
be
not
scald
,
only
my
stocking
and
breech
in
a
sad
condition
.
 
<EOS>
the
dwarf
,
at
my
entreaty
,
have
no
other
punishment
than
a
sound
whip
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
frequently
rally
by
the
queen
upon
account
of
my
fearfulness
;
and
she
use
to
ask
me
whether
the
people
of
my
country
be
as
great
coward
as
myself
?
 
<EOS>
the
occasion
be
this
:
the
kingdom
be
much
pester
with
fly
in
summer
;
and
these
odious
insect
,
each
of
them
as
big
as
a
dunstable
lark
,
hardly
give
me
any
rest
while
I
sit
at
dinner
,
with
their
continual
humming
and
buzz
about
mine
ear
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
sometimes
alight
upon
my
victual
,
and
leave
their
loathsome
excrement
,
or
spawn
behind
,
which
to
me
be
very
visible
,
though
not
to
the
native
of
that
country
,
whose
large
optic
be
not
so
acute
as
mine
,
in
view
small
object
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
they
would
fix
upon
my
nose
,
or
forehead
,
where
they
sting
me
to
the
quick
,
smell
very
offensively
;
and
I
could
easily
trace
that
viscous
matter
,
which
,
our
naturalist
tell
us
,
enable
those
creature
to
walk
with
their
foot
upwards
upon
a
ceiling
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
much
ado
to
defend
myself
against
these
detestable
animal
,
and
could
not
forbear
start
when
they
come
on
my
face
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
common
practice
of
the
dwarf
,
to
catch
a
number
of
these
insect
in
his
hand
,
as
schoolboy
do
among
us
,
and
let
them
out
suddenly
under
my
nose
,
on
purpose
to
frighten
me
,
and
divert
the
queen
.
 
<EOS>
My
remedy
be
to
cut
them
in
piece
with
my
knife
,
as
they
fly
in
the
air
,
wherein
my
dexterity
be
much
admire
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
,
one
morning
,
when
Glumdalclitch
have
set
me
in
a
box
upon
a
window
,
as
she
usually
do
in
fair
day
to
give
me
air
(
for
I
durst
not
venture
to
let
the
box
be
hang
on
a
nail
out
of
the
window
,
as
we
do
with
cage
in
England
)
,
after
I
have
lift
up
one
of
my
sash
,
and
sit
down
at
my
table
to
eat
a
piece
of
sweet
cake
for
my
breakfast
,
above
twenty
wasp
,
allure
by
the
smell
,
come
fly
into
the
room
,
hum
louder
than
the
drone
of
as
many
bagpipe
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
them
seize
my
cake
,
and
carry
it
piecemeal
away
;
other
fly
about
my
head
and
face
,
confound
me
with
the
noise
,
and
put
me
in
the
utmost
terror
of
their
sting
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
have
the
courage
to
rise
and
draw
my
hanger
,
and
attack
them
in
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
I
dispatch
four
of
them
,
but
the
rest
get
away
,
and
I
presently
shut
my
window
.
 
<EOS>
these
insect
be
as
large
as
partridge
:
 
<EOS>
I
take
out
their
sting
,
find
them
an
inch
and
a
half
long
,
and
as
sharp
as
needle
.
 
<EOS>
I
carefully
preserve
them
all
;
and
have
since
show
them
,
with
some
other
curiosity
,
in
several
part
of
Europe
,
upon
my
return
to
England
<EOS>
I
give
three
of
them
to
Gresham
College
,
and
keep
the
fourth
for
myself
.
   
<EOS>
the
country
describe
.
 
<EOS>
a
proposal
for
correct
modern
map
.
<EOS>
the
king
's
palace
;
and
some
account
of
the
metropolis
.
 
<EOS>
the
author
's
way
of
travel
.
 
<EOS>
the
chief
temple
describe
.
 
<EOS>
I
now
intend
to
give
the
reader
a
short
description
of
this
country
,
as
far
as
I
travel
in
it
,
which
be
not
above
two
thousand
mile
round
Lorbrulgrud
,
the
metropolis
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
queen
,
whom
I
always
attend
,
never
go
farther
when
she
accompany
the
king
in
his
progress
,
and
there
staid
till
his
majesty
return
from
view
his
frontier
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
extent
of
this
prince
's
dominion
reach
about
six
thousand
mile
in
length
,
and
from
three
to
five
in
breadth
:
 
whence
<EOS>
I
can
not
but
conclude
,
that
our
geographer
of
Europe
be
in
a
great
error
,
by
suppose
nothing
but
sea
between
Japan
and
California
;
for
it
be
ever
my
opinion
,
that
there
must
be
a
balance
of
earth
to
counterpoise
the
great
continent
of
Tartary
;
and
therefore
they
ought
to
correct
their
map
and
chart
,
by
join
this
vast
tract
of
land
to
the
north
-
west
part
of
America
<EOS>
,
wherein
I
shall
be
ready
to
lend
them
my
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
the
kingdom
be
a
peninsula
,
terminate
to
the
north
-
east
by
a
ridge
of
mountain
thirty
mile
high
,
which
be
altogether
impassable
,
by
reason
of
the
volcano
upon
the
top
:
 
<EOS>
neither
do
the
most
learn
know
what
sort
of
mortal
inhabit
beyond
those
mountain
,
or
whether
they
be
inhabit
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
three
other
side
,
it
be
bound
by
the
ocean
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
one
seaport
in
the
whole
kingdom
:
 
and
those
part
of
the
coast
into
which
the
river
issue
,
be
so
full
of
pointed
rock
,
and
the
sea
generally
so
rough
,
that
there
be
no
venture
with
the
small
of
their
boat
;
so
that
these
people
be
wholly
exclude
from
any
commerce
with
the
rest
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
large
river
be
full
of
vessel
,
and
abound
with
excellent
fish
;
for
they
seldom
get
any
from
the
sea
,
because
the
sea
fish
be
of
the
same
size
with
those
in
Europe
,
and
consequently
not
worth
catching
;
<EOS>
whereby
it
be
manifest
,
that
nature
,
in
the
production
of
plant
and
animal
of
so
extraordinary
a
bulk
,
be
wholly
confine
to
this
continent
,
of
which
I
leave
the
reason
to
be
determine
by
philosopher
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
now
and
then
they
take
a
whale
that
happen
to
be
dash
against
the
rock
,
which
the
common
people
feed
on
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
these
whale
I
have
know
so
large
,
that
a
man
could
hardly
carry
one
upon
his
shoulder
;
and
sometimes
,
for
curiosity
,
they
be
bring
in
hamper
to
Lorbrulgrud
;
I
see
one
of
them
in
a
dish
at
the
king
's
table
,
which
pass
for
a
rarity
,
but
I
do
not
observe
he
be
fond
of
it
;
for
I
think
,
indeed
,
the
bigness
disgust
him
,
although
I
have
see
one
somewhat
large
in
Greenland
.
  
<EOS>
the
country
be
well
inhabit
,
for
it
contain
fifty
-
one
city
,
near
a
hundred
wall
town
,
and
a
great
number
of
village
.
 
<EOS>
to
satisfy
my
curious
reader
,
it
may
be
sufficient
to
describe
Lorbrulgrud
.
 
<EOS>
this
city
stand
upon
almost
two
equal
part
,
on
each
side
the
river
that
pass
through
.
 
<EOS>
It
contain
above
eighty
thousand
house
,
and
<EOS>
about
six
hundred
thousand
inhabitant
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
length
three
glomglung
(
which
make
about
fifty
-
four
english
mile
,
)
and
two
and
a
half
in
breadth
;
as
I
measure
it
myself
in
the
royal
map
make
by
the
king
's
order
,
which
be
lay
on
the
ground
on
purpose
for
me
,
and
extend
a
hundred
foot
:
 
<EOS>
I
pace
the
diameter
and
circumference
several
time
barefoot
,
and
,
compute
by
the
scale
,
measure
it
pretty

<EOS>
the
king
's
palace
be
no
regular
edifice
,
but
a
heap
of
building
,
about
seven
mile
round
:
 
the
chief
room
be
generally
two
hundred
and
forty
foot
high
,
and
broad
and
long
in
proportion
.
 
<EOS>
a
coach
be
allow
to
glumdalclitch
and
me
,
wherein
her
governess
frequently
take
her
out
to
see
the
town
,
or
go
among
the
shop
;
and
I
be
always
of
the
party
,
carry
in
my
box
;
although
the
girl
,
at
my
own
desire
,
would
often
take
me
out
,
and
hold
me
in
her
hand
,
that
I
may
more
conveniently
view
the
house
and
the
people
,
as
we
pass
along
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
I
reckon
our
coach
to
be
about
a
square
of
Westminster
-
hall
,
but
not
altogether
so
high
:
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
can
not
be
very
exact
.
 
<EOS>
one
day
the
governess
order
our
coachman
to
stop
at
several
shop
,
where
the
beggar
,
watch
their
opportunity
,
crowd
to
the
side
of
the
coach
,
and
give
me
the
most
horrible
spectacle
that
ever
a
european
eye
beheld
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
woman
with
a
cancer
in
her
breast
,
swell
to
a
monstrous
size
,
full
of
hole
,
in
two
or
three
of
which
I
could
have
easily
creep
,
and
cover
my
whole
body
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
fellow
with
a
wen
in
his
neck
,
large
than
five
wool
-
pack
;
and
another
,
with
a
couple
of
wooden
leg
,
each
about
twenty
foot
high
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
most
hateful
sight
of
all
,
be
the
lice
crawl
on
their
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
see
distinctly
the
limb
of
these
vermin
with
my
naked
eye
,
much
well
than
those
of
a
european
louse
through
a
microscope
,
and
their
snout
with
which
they
root
like
swine
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
the
first
I
have
ever
beheld
,
and
I
should
have
be
curious
enough
to
dissect
one
of
them
,
if
I
have
have
proper
instrument
,
which
I
unluckily
leave
behind
me
in
the
ship
,
although
,
indeed
,
the
sight
be
so
nauseous
,
that
it
perfectly
turn
my
stomach
.
  
<EOS>
besides
the
large
box
in
which
I
be
usually
carry
,
the
queen
order
a
small
one
to
be
make
for
me
,
of
about
twelve
foot
square
,
and
ten
high
,
for
the
convenience
of
travelling
;
because
the
other
be
somewhat
too
large
for
Glumdalclitch
's
lap
,
and
cumbersome
in
the
coach
;
it
be
make
by
the
same
artist
,
whom
I
direct
in
the
whole
contrivance
.
 
<EOS>
this
travel
-
closet
be
an
exact
square
,
with
a
window
in
the
middle
of
three
of
the
square
,
and
each
window
be
lattice
with
iron
wire
on
the
outside
,
to
prevent
accident
in
long
journey
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
fourth
side
,
which
have
no
window
,
two
strong
staple
be
fix
,
through
which
the
person
that
carry
me
,
when
I
have
a
mind
to
be
on
horseback
,
put
a
leathern
belt
,
and
buckle
it
about
his
waist
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
always
the
office
of
some
grave
trusty
servant
,
in
whom
I
could
confide
,
whether
I
attend
the
king
and
queen
in
their
progress
,
or
be
dispose
to
see
the
garden
,
or
pay
a
visit
to
some
great
lady
or
minister
of
state
in
the
court
,
when
glumdalclitch
happen
to
be
out
of
order
;
for
I
soon
begin
to
be
know
and
esteem
among
the
great
officer
,
I
suppose
more
upon
account
of
their
majesty
'
favour
,
than
any
merit
of
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
in
journey
,
when
I
be
weary
of
the
coach
,
a
servant
on
horseback
would
buckle
on
my
box
,
and
place
it
upon
a
cushion
before
him
;
and
there
I
have
a
full
prospect
of
the
country
on
three
side
,
from
my
three
window
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
,
in
this
closet
,
a
field
-
bed
and
a
hammock
,
<EOS>
hang
from
the
ceiling
,
two
chair
and
a
table
,
neatly
screw
to
the
floor
,
to
prevent
be
toss
about
by
the
agitation
of
the
horse
or
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
and
have
be
long
use
to
sea
-
voyage
,
those
motion
,
although
sometimes
very
violent
,
do
not
much
discompose
me
.
  
<EOS>
whenever
I
have
a
mind
to
see
the
town
,
it
be
always
in
my
travelling
-
closet
;
which
glumdalclitch
hold
in
her
lap
in
a
kind
of
open
sedan
,
after
the
fashion
of
the
country
,
bear
by
four
man
,
and
attend
by
two
other
in
the
queen
's
livery
.
 
<EOS>
the
people
,
who
have
often
hear
of
me
,
be
very
curious
to
crowd
about
the
sedan
,
and
the
girl
be
complaisant
enough
to
make
the
bearer
stop
,
and
to
take
me
in
her
hand
,
that
I
may
be
more
conveniently
see
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
very
desirous
to
see
the
chief
temple
,
and
particularly
the
tower
belong
to
it
,
which
be
reckon
the
high
in
the
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
one
day
my
nurse
carry
me
thither
,
but
<EOS>
I
may
truly
say
I
come
back
disappointed
;
for
the
height
be
not
above
three
thousand
foot
,
reckon
from
the
ground
to
the
high
pinnacle
top
;
which
,
allow
for
the
difference
between
the
size
of
those
people
and
us
in
Europe
,
be
no
great
matter
for
admiration
,
nor
at
all
equal
in
proportion
(
if
I
rightly
remember
)
to
Salisbury
steeple
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
not
to
detract
from
a
nation
,
to
which
,
during
my
life
,
I
shall
acknowledge
myself
extremely
oblige
<EOS>
,
it
must
be
allow
,
that
whatever
this
famous
tower
want
in
height
,
be
amply
make
up
in
beauty
and
strength
:
 
for
the
wall
be
near
a
hundred
foot
thick
,
build
of
hewn
stone
,
whereof
each
be
about
forty
foot
square
,
and
adorn
on
all
side
with
statue
of
god
and
emperor
,
cut
in
marble
,
large
than
the
life
,
place
in
their
several
niche
.
 
<EOS>
I
measure
a
little
finger
which
have
fall
down
from
one
of
these
statue
,
and
lie
unperceived
among
some
rubbish
,
and
find
it
exactly
four
foot
and
an
inch
in
length
.
<EOS>
glumdalclitch
wrap
it
up
in
her
handkerchief
,
and
carry
it
home
in
her
pocket
,
to
keep
among
other
trinket
,
of
which
the
girl
be
very
fond
,
as
child
at
her
age
usually
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
king
's
kitchen
be
indeed
a
noble
building
,
vault
at
top
,
and
about
six
hundred
foot
high
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
oven
be
not
so
wide
,
by
ten
pace
,
as
the
cupola
at
St.
Paul
's
:
 
for
I
measure
the
latter
on
purpose
,
after
my
return
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
I
should
describe
the
kitchen
grate
,
the
prodigious
pot
and
kettle
,
the
joint
of
meat
turn
on
the
spit
,
with
many
other
particular
,
perhaps
I
should
be
hardly
believe
;
at
least
a
severe
critic
would
be
apt
to
think
I
enlarge
a
little
,
as
traveller
be
often
suspect
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
to
avoid
which
censure
<EOS>
I
fear
I
have
run
too
much
into
the
other
extreme
;
and
that
if
this
treatise
should
happen
to
be
translate
into
the
language
of
Brobdingnag
(
which
be
the
general
name
of
that
kingdom
,
)
and
transmit
thither
,
the
king
and
his
people
would
have
reason
to
complain
that
I
have
do
them
an
injury
,
by
a
false
and
diminutive
representation
.
  
<EOS>
His
majesty
seldom
keep
above
six
hundred
horse
in
his
stable
:
they
be
generally
from
fifty
-
four
to
sixty
foot
high
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
when
he
go
abroad
on
solemn
day
,
he
be
attend
,
for
state
,
by
a
military
guard
of
five
hundred
horse
,
which
,
indeed
,
I
think
be
the
most
splendid
sight
that
could
be
ever
behold
,
till
I
see
part
of
his
army
in
battalia
<EOS>
,
whereof
I
shall
find
another
occasion
to
speak
.
   
<EOS>
several
adventurer
that
happen
to
the
author
.
 
<EOS>
the
execution
of
a
criminal
.
 
<EOS>
the
author
show
his
skill
in
navigation
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
live
happy
enough
in
that
country
,
if
my
littleness
have
not
expose
me
to
several
ridiculous
and
troublesome
accident
;
some
of
which
I
shall
venture
to
relate
.
 
<EOS>
Glumdalclitch
often
carry
me
into
the
garden
of
the
court
in
my
small
box
,
and
would
sometimes
take
me
out
of
it
,
and
hold
me
in
her
hand
,
or
set
me
down
to
walk
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
,
before
the
dwarf
leave
the
queen
,
he
follow
us
one
day
into
those
garden
,
and
my
nurse
have
set
me
down
,
he
and
I
be
close
together
,
near
some
dwarf
apple
tree
,
I
must
needs
<EOS>
show
my
wit
,
by
a
silly
allusion
between
him
and
the
tree
,
which
happen
to
hold
in
their
language
as
it
do
in
ours
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
,
the
malicious
rogue
,
watch
his
opportunity
,
when
I
be
walk
under
one
of
them
,
shake
it
directly
over
my
head
,
by
which
a
dozen
apple
,
each
of
them
near
as
large
as
a
Bristol
barrel
,
come
tumble
about
my
ear
;
one
of
them
hit
me
on
the
back
as
I
chance
to
stoop
,
and
knock
me
down
flat
on
my
face
;
but
I
receive
no
other
hurt
,
and
the
dwarf
be
pardon
at
my
desire
,
because
I
have
give
the
provocation
.
  
<EOS>
another
day
,
Glumdalclitch
leave
me
on
a
smooth
grass
-
plot
to
divert
myself
,
while
she
walk
at
some
distance
with
her
governess
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
there
suddenly
fall
such
a
violent
shower
of
hail
,
that
I
be
immediately
by
the
force
of
it
,
strike
to
the
ground
:
and
when
I
be
down
,
the
hailstone
give
me
such
cruel
bang
all
over
the
body
,
as
if
I
have
be
pelt
with
tennis
-
ball
;
however
,
I
make
a
shift
to
creep
on
all
four
,
and
shelter
myself
,
by
lie
flat
on
my
face
,
on
the
lee
-
side
of
a
border
of
lemon
-
thyme
,
but
so
bruise
from
head
to
foot
,
that
I
could
not
go
abroad
in
ten
day
.
<EOS>
neither
be
this
at
all
to
be
wonder
at
,
because
nature
,
in
that
country
,
observe
the
same
proportion
through
all
her
operation
,
a
hailstone
be
near
eighteen
hundred
time
as
large
as
one
in
Europe
;
which
I
can
assert
upon
experience
,
have
be
so
curious
as
to
weigh
and
measure
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
a
more
dangerous
accident
happen
to
me
in
the
same
garden
,
when
my
little
nurse
,
believe
she
have
put
me
in
a
secure
place
(
which
I
often
entreat
her
to
do
,
that
I
may
enjoy
my
own
thought
,
)
and
have
leave
my
box
at
home
,
to
avoid
the
trouble
of
carry
it
,
go
to
another
part
of
the
garden
with
her
governess
and
some
lady
of
her
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
while
she
be
absent
,
and
out
of
hearing
,
a
small
white
spaniel
that
belong
to
one
of
the
chief
gardener
,
have
get
by
accident
into
the
garden
,
happen
to
range
near
the
place
where
I
lie
:
 
the
dog
,
follow
the
scent
,
come
directly
up
,
and
take
me
in
his
mouth
,
run
straight
to
his
master
wag
his
tail
,
and
set
me
gently
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
by
good
fortune
he
have
be
so
well
teach
,
that
I
be
carry
between
his
tooth
without
the
least
hurt
,
or
even
tear
my
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
poor
gardener
,
who
know
me
well
,
and
have
a
great
kindness
for
me
,
be
in
a
terrible
fright
:
 
<EOS>
he
gently
take
me
up
in
both
his
hand
,
and
ask
me
how
I
do
?
<EOS>
but
I
be
so
amazed
and
out
of
breath
,
that
I
could
not
speak
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
I
come
to
myself
,
and
he
carry
me
safe
to
my
little
nurse
,
who
,
by
this
time
,
have
return
to
the
place
where
she
leave
me
,
and
be
in
cruel
agony
when
I
do
not
appear
,
nor
answer
when
she
call
.
 
<EOS>
She
severely
reprimand
the
gardener
on
account
of
his
dog
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
thing
be
hush
up
,
and
never
know
at
court
,
<EOS>
for
the
girl
be
afraid
of
the
queen
's
anger
;
and
truly
,
as
to
myself
,
I
think
it
would
not
be
for
my
reputation
,
that
such
a
story
should
go
about
.
  
<EOS>
this
accident
absolutely
determine
Glumdalclitch
never
to
trust
me
abroad
for
the
future
out
of
her
sight
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
long
afraid
of
this
resolution
,
and
therefore
conceal
from
her
some
little
unlucky
adventure
,
that
happen
in
those
time
when
I
be
leave
by
myself
.
 
<EOS>
once
a
kite
,
hover
over
the
garden
,
make
a
stoop
at
me
,
and
if
I
have
not
resolutely
draw
my
hanger
,
and
run
under
a
thick
espalier
,
he
would
have
certainly
carry
me
away
in
his
talon
.
<EOS>
another
time
,
walk
to
the
top
of
a
fresh
mole
-
hill
,
I
fall
to
my
neck
in
the
hole
,
through
which
that
animal
have
cast
up
the
earth
,
and
coin
some
lie
,
not
worth
remember
,
to
excuse
myself
for
spoil
my
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
I
likewise
break
my
right
shin
against
the
shell
of
a
snail
,
which
I
happen
to
stumble
over
,
as
I
be
walk
alone
and
think
on
poor
England
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
whether
I
be
more
pleased
or
mortify
to
observe
,
in
those
solitary
walk
,
that
the
small
bird
do
not
appear
to
be
at
all
afraid
of
me
,
but
would
hop
about
within
a
yard
's
distance
,
look
for
worm
and
other
food
,
with
as
much
indifference
and
security
as
if
no
creature
at
all
be
near
them
.
<EOS>
I
remember
,
a
thrush
have
the
confidence
to
snatch
out
of
my
hand
,
with
his
bill
,
a
of
cake
that
Glumdalclitch
have
just
give
me
for
my
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
attempt
to
catch
any
of
these
bird
,
they
would
boldly
turn
against
me
,
endeavour
to
peck
my
finger
,
which
I
durst
not
venture
within
their
reach
;
and
then
they
would
hop
back
unconcerned
,
to
hunt
for
worm
or
snail
,
as
they
do
before
.
 
<EOS>
but
one
day
,
I
take
a
thick
cudgel
,
and
throw
it
with
all
my
strength
so
luckily
,
at
a
linnet
,
that
I
knock
him
down
,
and
seize
him
by
the
neck
with
both
my
hand
,
run
with
him
in
triumph
to
my
nurse
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
the
bird
,
who
have
only
be
stun
,
recover
himself
give
me
so
many
box
with
his
wing
,
on
both
side
of
my
head
and
body
,
though
I
hold
him
at
arm's
-
length
,
and
be
out
of
the
reach
of
his
claws
,
that
I
be
twenty
time
think
to
let
him
go
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
soon
relieve
by
one
of
our
servant
,
who
wring
off
the
bird
's
neck
,
and
<EOS>
I
have
him
next
day
for
dinner
,
by
the
queen
's
command
.
 
<EOS>
this
linnet
,
as
near
as
I
can
remember
,
seem
to
be
somewhat
large
than
an
english
swan
.
  
<EOS>
the
maid
of
honour
often
invite
Glumdalclitch
to
their
apartment
,
and
desire
she
would
bring
me
along
with
her
,
on
purpose
to
have
the
pleasure
of
see
and
touch
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
often
strip
me
naked
from
top
to
toe
,
and
lie
me
at
full
length
in
their
bosom
;
wherewith
I
be
much
disgusted
because
,
to
say
the
truth
,
a
very
offensive
smell
come
from
their
skin
;
which
I
do
not
mention
,
or
intend
,
to
the
disadvantage
of
those
excellent
lady
,
for
whom
I
have
all
manner
of
respect
;
but
I
conceive
that
my
sense
be
more
acute
in
proportion
to
my
littleness
,
and
that
those
illustrious
person
be
no
more
disagreeable
to
their
lover
,
or
to
each
other
,
than
people
of
the
same
quality
be
with
us
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
after
all
,
I
find
their
natural
smell
be
much
more
supportable
,
than
when
they
use
perfume
,
under
which
I
immediately
swoon
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
forget
,
that
an
intimate
friend
of
mine
in
Lilliput
,
take
the
freedom
in
a
warm
day
,
when
I
have
use
a
good
deal
of
exercise
,
to
complain
of
a
strong
smell
about
me
,
although
I
be
as
little
faulty
that
way
,
as
most
of
my
sex
:
but
I
suppose
his
faculty
of
smell
be
as
nice
with
regard
to
me
,
as
mine
be
to
that
of
this
people
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
point
,
I
can
not
forbear
do
justice
to
the
queen
my
mistress
,
and
glumdalclitch
my
nurse
,
whose
person
be
as
sweet
as
those
of
any
lady
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
that
which
give
me
most
uneasiness
among
these
maid
of
honour
(
when
my
nurse
carry
me
to
visit
then
)
be
,
to
see
them
use
me
without
any
manner
of
ceremony
,
like
a
creature
who
have
no
sort
of
consequence
:
 
for
they
would
strip
themselves
to
the
skin
,
and
put
on
their
smock
in
my
presence
,
while
I
be
place
on
their
toilet
,
directly
before
their
naked
body
,
which
I
be
sure
to
me
be
very
far
from
be
a
tempting
sight
,
or
from
give
me
any
other
emotion
than
those
of
horror
and
disgust
:
 
their
skin
appear
so
coarse
and
uneven
,
so
variously
coloured
,
when
I
see
them
near
,
with
a
mole
here
and
there
as
broad
as
a
trencher
,
and
hair
hang
from
it
thick
than
packthread
,
to
say
nothing
farther
concern
the
rest
of
their
person
.
 
<EOS>
neither
do
they
at
all
scruple
,
while
I
be
by
,
to
discharge
what
they
have
drink
,
to
the
quantity
of
at
least
two
hogshead
,
in
a
vessel
that
hold
above
three
tun
.
 
<EOS>
the
handsome
among
these
maid
of
honour
,
a
pleasant
,
frolicsome
girl
of
sixteen
,
would
sometimes
set
me
astride
upon
one
of
her
nipple
,
with
many
other
trick
,
wherein
the
reader
will
excuse
me
for
not
be
over
particular
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
so
much
displeased
,
that
I
entreat
Glumdalclitch
to
contrive
some
excuse
for
not
see
that
young
lady
any
more
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
,
a
young
gentleman
,
who
be
nephew
to
my
nurse
's
governess
,
come
and
press
them
both
to
see
an
execution
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
of
a
man
,
who
have
murder
one
of
that
gentleman
's
intimate
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
glumdalclitch
be
prevail
on
to
be
of
the
company
,
very
much
against
her
inclination
,
for
she
be
naturally
tender
-
hearted
:
and
,
as
for
myself
,
although
I
abhor
such
kind
of
spectacle
,
yet
my
curiosity
tempt
me
to
see
something
that
I
think
must
be
extraordinary
.
 
<EOS>
the
malefactor
be
fix
in
a
chair
upon
a
scaffold
erect
for
that
purpose
,
and
his
head
cut
off
at
one
blow
,
with
a
sword
of
about
forty
foot
long
.
 
<EOS>
the
vein
and
artery
spout
up
such
a
prodigious
quantity
of
blood
,
and
so
high
in
the
air
,
that
the
great
jet
d'eau
at
Versailles
be
not
equal
to
it
for
the
time
it
last
:
 
and
the
head
,
when
it
fall
on
the
scaffold
floor
,
give
such
a
bounce
as
make
me
start
,
although
I
be
at
least
half
an
english
mile
distant
.
  
<EOS>
the
queen
,
who
often
use
to
hear
me
talk
of
my
sea
-
voyage
,
and
take
all
occasion
to
divert
me
when
I
be
melancholy
,
ask
me
whether
I
understand
how
to
handle
a
sail
or
an
oar
,
and
whether
a
little
exercise
of
rowing
may
not
be
convenient
for
my
health
?
 
<EOS>
I
answer
,
that
I
understand
both
very
well
:
 
for
although
my
proper
employment
have
be
to
be
surgeon
or
doctor
to
the
ship
,
yet
often
,
upon
a
pinch
,
I
be
force
to
work
like
a
common
mariner
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
see
how
this
could
be
do
in
their
country
,
where
the
small
wherry
be
equal
to
a
first
-
rate
man
of
war
among
us
;
and
such
a
boat
as
I
could
manage
would
never
live
in
any
of
their
river
.
 
<EOS>
Her
majesty
say
,
if
I
would
contrive
a
boat
,
her
own
joiner
should
make
it
,
and
she
would
provide
a
place
for
me
to
sail
in
.
 
<EOS>
the
fellow
be
an
ingenious
workman
,
and
by
my
instruction
,
in
ten
day
,
finish
a
pleasure
-
boat
with
all
its
tackling
,
able
conveniently
to
hold
eight
Europeans
.
 
<EOS>
when
it
be
finish
,
the
queen
be
so
delighted
,
that
she
run
with
it
in
her
lap
to
the
king
,
who
order
it
to
be
put
into
a
cistern
full
of
water
,
with
me
in
it
,
by
way
of
trial
,
where
I
could
not
manage
my
two
scull
,
or
little
oar
,
for
want
of
room
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
queen
have
before
contrive
another
project
.
 
<EOS>
She
order
the
joiner
to
make
a
wooden
trough
of
three
hundred
foot
long
,
fifty
broad
,
and
eight
deep
;
which
,
be
well
pitch
,
to
prevent
leaking
,
be
place
on
the
floor
,
along
the
wall
,
in
an
outer
room
of
the
palace
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
a
cock
near
the
bottom
to
let
out
the
water
,
when
it
begin
to
grow
stale
;
and
two
servant
could
easily
fill
it
in
half
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
here
I
often
use
to
row
for
my
own
diversion
,
as
well
as
that
of
the
queen
and
her
lady
,
who
think
themselves
well
entertain
with
my
skill
and
agility
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
I
would
put
up
my
sail
,
and
then
my
business
be
only
to
steer
,
while
the
lady
give
me
a
gale
with
their
fan
;
and
,
when
they
be
weary
,
some
of
their
page
would
blow
my
sail
forward
with
their
breath
,
while
I
show
my
art
by
steer
starboard
or
larboard
as
I
please
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
do
,
Glumdalclitch
always
carry
back
my
boat
into
her
closet
,
and
hang
it
on
a
nail
to
dry
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
exercise
I
once
meet
an
accident
,
which
have
like
to
have
cost
me
my
life
;
for
,
one
of
the
page
have
put
my
boat
into
the
trough
,
the
governess
who
attend
Glumdalclitch
very
officiously
lift
me
up
,
to
place
me
in
the
boat
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
happen
to
slip
through
her
finger
,
and
should
infallibly
have
fall
down
forty
foot
upon
the
floor
,
if
,
by
the
lucky
chance
in
the
world
,
I
have
not
be
stop
by
a
cork
-
pin
that
stick
in
the
good
gentlewoman
's
stomacher
;
the
head
of
the
pin
passing
between
my
shirt
and
the
waistband
of
my
breech
,
and
thus
I
be
hold
by
the
middle
in
the
air
,
till
Glumdalclitch
run
to
my
relief
.
  
<EOS>
another
time
,
one
of
the
servant
,
whose
office
it
be
to
fill
my
trough
every
third
day
with
fresh
water
,
be
so
careless
as
to
let
a
huge
frog
(
not
perceive
it
)
slip
out
of
his
pail
.
 
<EOS>
the
frog
lie
conceal
till
I
be
put
into
my
boat
,
but
then
,
see
a
resting
-
place
,
climb
up
,
and
make
it
lean
so
much
on
one
side
,
that
I
be
force
to
balance
it
with
all
my
weight
on
the
other
,
to
prevent
overturning
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
frog
be
get
in
,
it
hop
at
once
half
the
length
of
the
boat
,
and
then
over
my
head
,
backward
and
forward
,
daub
my
face
and
clothe
with
its
odious
slime
.
 
<EOS>
the
largeness
of
its
feature
make
it
appear
the
most
deform
animal
that
can
be
conceive
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
desire
Glumdalclitch
to
let
me
deal
with
it
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
bang
it
<EOS>
a
good
while
with
one
of
my
scull
,
and
at
last
force
it
to
leap
out
of
the
boat
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
great
danger
I
ever
undergo
in
that
kingdom
,
be
from
a
monkey
,
who
belong
to
one
of
the
clerk
of
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
glumdalclitch
have
lock
me
up
in
her
closet
,
while
she
go
somewhere
upon
business
,
or
a
visit
.
 
<EOS>
the
weather
be
very
warm
,
the
closet
-
window
be
leave
open
,
as
well
as
the
window
and
the
door
of
my
big
box
,
in
which
I
usually
live
,
because
of
its
largeness
and
conveniency
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
sit
quietly
meditate
at
my
table
<EOS>
,
I
hear
something
bounce
in
at
the
closet
-
window
,
and
skip
about
from
one
side
to
the
other
:
 
whereat
,
although
I
be
much
alarm
,
yet
I
venture
to
look
out
,
but
not
stir
from
my
seat
;
and
then
I
see
this
frolicsome
animal
frisk
and
leap
up
and
down
,
till
at
last
he
come
to
my
box
,
which
he
seem
to
view
with
great
pleasure
and
curiosity
,
peep
in
at
the
door
and
every
window
.
 
<EOS>
I
retreat
to
the
farther
corner
of
my
room
;
or
box
;
but
the
monkey
look
in
at
every
side
,
put
me
in
such
a
fright
,
that
I
want
presence
of
mind
to
conceal
myself
under
the
bed
,
as
I
may
easily
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
after
some
time
spend
in
peeping
,
grin
,
and
chatter
,
he
at
last
espy
me
;
and
reach
one
of
his
paw
in
at
the
door
,
as
a
cat
do
when
she
play
with
a
mouse
,
although
I
often
shift
place
to
avoid
him
,
he
at
length
seize
the
lappet
of
my
coat
(
which
be
make
of
that
country
silk
<EOS>
,
be
very
thick
and
strong
)
,
and
drag
me
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
me
up
in
his
right
fore
-
foot
and
hold
me
as
a
nurse
do
a
child
she
be
go
to
suckle
,
just
as
I
have
see
the
same
sort
of
creature
do
with
a
kitten
in
Europe
;
and
when
I
offer
to
struggle
he
squeeze
me
so
hard
,
<EOS>
that
I
think
it
more
prudent
to
submit
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
good
reason
to
believe
,
that
he
take
me
for
a
young
one
of
his
own
specie
,
by
his
often
stroke
my
face
very
gently
with
his
other
paw
.
 
<EOS>
in
these
diversion
he
be
interrupt
by
a
noise
at
the
closet
door
,
as
if
somebody
be
open
it
:
 
<EOS>
whereupon
he
suddenly
leap
up
to
the
window
at
which
he
have
come
in
,
and
thence
upon
the
lead
and
gutter
,
walk
upon
three
leg
,
and
hold
me
in
the
fourth
,
till
he
clamber
up
to
a
roof
that
be
next
to
ours
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
Glumdalclitch
give
a
shriek
at
the
moment
he
be
carry
me
out
.
<EOS>
the
poor
girl
be
almost
distract
:
 
<EOS>
that
quarter
of
the
palace
be
all
in
an
uproar
;
the
servant
run
for
ladder
;
the
monkey
be
see
by
hundred
in
the
court
,
sit
upon
the
ridge
of
a
building
,
hold
me
like
a
baby
in
one
of
his
forepaw
,
and
feed
me
with
the
other
,
by
cram
into
my
mouth
some
victual
he
have
squeeze
out
of
the
bag
on
one
side
of
his
chap
,
and
pat
me
when
I
would
not
eat
;
whereat
many
of
the
rabble
below
could
not
forbear
laughing
;
neither
do
I
think
they
justly
ought
to
be
blame
,
for
,
without
question
,
the
sight
be
ridiculous
enough
to
every
body
but
myself
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
the
people
throw
up
stone
,
hope
to
drive
the
monkey
down
;
but
this
be
strictly
forbid
,
or
else
,
very
probably
,
my
brain
have
be
dash
out
.
  
<EOS>
the
ladder
be
now
apply
,
and
mount
by
several
man
;
which
the
monkey
observing
,
and
find
himself
almost
encompassed
,
not
be
able
to
make
speed
enough
with
his
three
leg
,
let
me
drop
on
a
ridge
tile
,
and
make
his
escape
.
 
<EOS>
here
I
sit
for
some
time
,
five
hundred
yard
from
the
ground
,
expect
every
moment
to
be
blow
down
by
the
wind
,
or
to
fall
by
my
own
giddiness
,
and
come
tumble
over
and
over
from
the
ridge
to
the
eave
;
but
an
honest
lad
,
one
of
my
nurse
's
footman
,
climb
up
,
and
put
me
into
his
breech
pocket
,
bring
me
down
safe
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
almost
choke
with
the
filthy
stuff
the
monkey
have
cram
down
my
throat
:
 
but
my
dear
little
nurse
pick
it
out
of
my
mouth
with
a
small
needle
,
and
then
I
fall
a
-
vomiting
,
which
give
me
great
relief
.
 
<EOS>
yet
I
be
so
weak
and
bruise
in
the
side
with
the
squeeze
give
me
by
this
odious
animal
,
that
I
be
force
to
keep
my
bed
a
fortnight
.

court
,
send
every
day
to
inquire
after
my
health
;
and
her
majesty
make
me
several
visit
during
my
sickness
.
 
<EOS>
the
monkey
be
kill
,
and
an
order
make
,
that
no
such
animal
should
be
keep
about
the
palace
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
attend
the
king
after
my
recovery
,
to
return
him
thank
for
his
favour
,
he
be
pleased
to
rally
me
a
good
deal
upon
this
adventure
.
 
<EOS>
He
ask
me
,
"
what
my
thought
and
speculation
be
,
while
I
lie
in
the
monkey
's
paw
<EOS>
;
how
I
like
the
victual
he
give
me
;
his
manner
of
feeding
;
and
whether
the
fresh
air
on
the
roof
have
sharpen
my
stomach
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
desire
to
know
,
"
what
I
would
have
do
upon
such
an
occasion
in
my
own
country
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
tell
his
majesty
,
"
that
in
Europe
we
have
no
monkey
,
except
such
as
be
bring
for
curiosity
from
other
place
,
and
so
small
,
that
I
could
deal
with
a
dozen
of
them
together
,
if
they
presume
to
attack
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
for
that
monstrous
animal
with
whom
I
be
so
lately
engaged
(
it
be
indeed
as
large
as
an
elephant
)
,
if
my
fear
have
suffer
me
to
think
so
far
as
to
make
use
of
my
hanger
,
"
(
look
fiercely
,
and
clap
my
hand
on
the
hilt
,
as
I
speak
)
<EOS>
"
when
he
poke
his
paw
into
my
chamber
,
perhaps
I
should
have
give
him
such
a
wound
,
as
would
have
make
him
glad
to
withdraw
it
with
more
haste
than
he
put
it
in
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
I
deliver
in
a
firm
tone
,
like
a
person
who
be
jealous
lest
his
courage
should
be
call
in
question
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
my
speech
produce
nothing
else
beside
a
laud
laughter
,
which
all
the
respect
due
to
his
majesty
from
those
about
him
could
not
make
them
contain
.
 
<EOS>
this
make
me
reflect
,
how
vain
an
attempt
it
be
for
a
man
to
endeavour
to
do
himself
honour
among
those
who
be
out
of
all
degree
of
equality
or
comparison
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
have
see
the
moral
of
my
own
behaviour
very
frequent
in
England
since
my
return
;
where
a
little
contemptible
varlet
,
without
the
least
title
to
birth
,
person
,
wit
,
or
common
sense
,
shall
presume
to
look
with
importance
,
and
put
himself
upon
a
foot
with
the
great
person
of
the
kingdom
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
every
day
furnish
the
court
with
some
ridiculous
story
:
and
Glumdalclitch
,
although
she
love
me
to
excess
,
yet
be
arch
enough
to
inform
the
queen
,
whenever
I
commit
any
folly
that
she
think
would
be
divert
to
her
majesty
.
 
<EOS>
the
girl
,
who
have
be
out
of
order
,
be
carry
by
her
governess
to
take
the
air
about
an
hour
's
distance
,
or
thirty
mile
from
town
.
 
<EOS>
They
alight
out
of
the
coach
near
a
small
foot
-
path
in
a
field
,
and
glumdalclitch
set
down
my
travelling
box
<EOS>
,
I
go
out
of
it
to
walk
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
cow
-
dung
in
the
path
,
and
I
must
need
try
my
activity
by
attempt
to
leap
over
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
a
run
,
but
unfortunately
jump
short
,
and
find
myself
just
in
the
middle
up
to
my
knee
.
 
<EOS>
I
wade
through
with
some
difficulty
,
and
one
of
the
footman
wipe
me
as
clean
as
he
could
with
his
handkerchief
,
for
I
be
filthily
bemire
;
and
my
nurse
confine
me
to
my
box
,
till
we
return
home
;
where
the
queen
be
soon
inform
of
what
have
pass
,
and
the
footman
spread
it
about
the
court
:
 
so
that
all
the
mirth
for
some
day
be
at
my
expense
.
   
<EOS>
several
contrivance
of
the
author
to
please
the
king
and
queen
.
<EOS>
He
show
his
skill
in
music
.
 
<EOS>
the
king
inquire
into
the
state
of
England
,
which
the
author
relate
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
king
's
observation
thereon
.
 
<EOS>
I
use
to
attend
the
king
's
levee
once
or
twice
a
week
,
and
have
often
see
him
under
the
barber
's
hand
,
which
indeed
be
at
first
very
terrible
to
behold
;
for
the
razor
be
almost
twice
as
long
as
an
ordinary
scythe
.
 
<EOS>
His
majesty
,
accord
to
the
custom
of
the
country
,
be
only
shave
twice
a
-
week
.
 
<EOS>
I
once
prevail
on
the
barber
to
give
me
some
of
the
suds
or
lather
,
out
of
which
<EOS>
I
pick
forty
or
fifty
of
the
strong
stump
of
hair
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
take
a
piece
of
fine
wood
,
and
cut
it
like
the
back
of
a
comb
,
make
several
hole
in
it
at
equal
distance
with
as
small
a
needle
as
I
could
get
from
Glumdalclitch
.
 
<EOS>
I
fix
in
the
stump
so
artificially
,
scrape
and
slope
them
with
my
knife
toward
the
point
,
that
I
make
a
very
tolerable
comb
;
which
be
a
seasonable
supply
,
my
own
being
so
much
break
in
the
tooth
,
that
it
be
almost
useless
:
 
neither
<EOS>
do
I
know
any
artist
in
that
country
so
nice
and
exact
,
as
would
undertake
to
make
me
another
.
  
<EOS>
and
this
put
me
in
mind
of
an
amusement
,
wherein
I
spend
many
of
my
leisure
hour
.
 
<EOS>
I
desire
the
queen
's
woman
to
save
for
me
the
combing
of
her
majesty
's
hair
,
whereof
in
time
I
get
a
good
quantity
;
and
consult
with
my
friend
the
cabinet
-
maker
,
who
have
receive
general
order
to
do
little
job
for
me
,
I
direct
him
to
make
two
chair
-
frame
,
no
large
than
those
I
have
in
my
box
,
and
to
bore
little
hole
with
a
fine
awl
,
round
those
part
where
I
design
the
back
and
seat
;
through
these
hole
I
wove
the
strong
hair
I
could
pick
out
,
just
after
the
manner
of
cane
chair
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
be
finish
,
I
make
a
present
of
them
to
her
majesty
;
who
keep
them
in
her
cabinet
,
and
use
to
show
them
for
curiosity
,
as
indeed
they
be
the
wonder
of
every
one
that
behold
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
queen
would
have
me
sit
upon
one
of
these
chair
,
but
I
absolutely
refuse
to
obey
her
,
protest
I
would
rather
die
than
place
a
dishonourable
part
of
my
body
on
those
precious
hair
,
<EOS>
that
once
adorn
her
majesty
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
of
these
hair
(
as
I
have
always
a
mechanical
genius
)
<EOS>
I
likewise
make
a
neat
little
purse
,
about
five
foot
long
,
with
her
majesty
's
name
decipher
in
gold
letter
,
which
I
give
to
Glumdalclitch
,
by
the
queen
's
consent
.
 
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
it
be
more
for
show
than
use
,
be
not
of
strength
to
bear
the
weight
of
the
large
coin
,
and
therefore
she
keep
nothing
in
it
but
some
little
toy
that
girl
be
fond
of
.
  
<EOS>
the
king
,
who
delight
in
music
,
have
frequent
concert
at
court
,
to
which
I
be
sometimes
carry
,
and
set
in
my
box
on
a
table
to
hear
them
:
 
but
the
noise
be
so
great
that
I
could
hardly
distinguish
the
tune
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
confident
that
all
the
drum
and
trumpet
of
a
royal
army
,
beat
and
sound
together
just
at
your
ear
,
could
not
equal
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
practice
be
to
have
my
box
remove
from
the
place
where
the
performer
sit
,
as
far
as
I
could
,
then
to
shut
the
door
and
window
of
it
,
and
draw
the
window
curtain
;
after
which
I
find
their
music
not
disagreeable
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
learn
in
my
youth
to
play
a
little
upon
the
spinet
.
<EOS>
glumdalclitch
keep
one
in
her
chamber
,
and
a
master
attend
twice
a
-
week
to
teach
her
:
 
<EOS>
I
call
it
a
spinet
,
because
it
somewhat
resemble
that
instrument
,
and
be
play
upon
in
the
same
manner
.
<EOS>
a
fancy
come
into
my
head
,
that
I
would
entertain
the
king
and
queen
with
an
english
tune
upon
this
instrument
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
appear
extremely
difficult
:
 
for
the
spinet
<EOS>
be
near
sixty
foot
long
,
each
key
be
almost
a
foot
wide
,
so
that
with
my
arm
extend
I
could
not
reach
to
above
five
key
,
and
to
press
them
down
<EOS>
require
a
good
smart
stroke
with
my
fist
,
which
would
be
too
great
a
labour
,
and
to
no
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
the
method
I
contrive
be
this
:
 
<EOS>
I
prepare
two
round
stick
,
about
the
bigness
of
common
cudgel
;
they
be
thick
at
one
end
than
the
other
,
and
I
cover
the
thick
end
with
piece
of
a
mouse
's
skin
,
that
by
rap
on
them
I
may
neither
damage
the
top
of
the
key
nor
interrupt
the
sound
.
<EOS>
before
the
spinet
a
bench
be
place
,
about
four
foot
below
the
key
,
and
I
be
put
upon
the
bench
.
 
<EOS>
I
run
sidele
upon
it
,
that
way
<EOS>
and
this
,
as
fast
as
I
could
,
bang
the
proper
key
with
my
two
stick
,
and
make
a
shift
to
play
a
jig
,
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
both
their
majesty
;
but
it
be
the
most
violent
exercise
I
ever
undergo
;
and
yet
I
could
not
strike
above
sixteen
key
,
nor
consequently
play
the
bass
and
treble
together
,
as
other
artist
do
;
which
be
a
great
disadvantage
to
my
performance
.
  
<EOS>
the
king
,
who
,
as
I
before
observe
,
be
a
prince
of
excellent
understanding
,
would
frequently
order
that
I
should
be
bring
in
my
box
,
and
set
upon
the
table
in
his
closet
:
 
he
would
then
command
me
to
bring
one
of
my
chair
out
of
the
box
,
and
sit
down
within
three
yard
distance
upon
the
top
of
the
cabinet
,
which
bring
me
almost
to
a
level
with
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
manner
I
have
several
conversation
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
one
day
take
the
freedom
to
tell
his
majesty
,
"
that
the
contempt
he
discover
towards
Europe
,
and
the
rest
of
the
world
,
do
not
seem
answerable
to
those
excellent
quality
of
mind
that
he
be
master
of
;
that
reason
do
not
extend
itself
with
the
bulk
of
the
body
;
on
the
contrary
,
we
observe
in
our
country
,
that
the
tall
person
be
usually
the
least
provide
with
it
;
that
among
other
animal
,
bee
and
ant
have
the
reputation
of
more
industry
,
art
,
and
sagacity
,
than
many
of
the
large
kind
;
and
that
,
as
inconsiderable
as
he
take
me
to
be
,
I
hope
I
may
live
to
do
his
majesty
some
signal
service
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
king
hear
me
with
attention
,
and
begin
to
conceive
a
much
well
opinion
of
me
than
he
have
ever
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
desire
"
I
would
give
him
as
exact
an
account
of
the
government
of
England
as
I
possibly
could
;
because
,
as
fond
as
prince
commonly
be
of
their
own
custom
(
for
so
he
conjecture
of
other
monarchs
,
by
my
former
discourse
)
,
he
should
be
glad
to
hear
of
any
thing
that
may
deserve
imitation
.
"
  
<EOS>
imagine
with
thyself
,
courteous
reader
,
how
often
I
then
wish
for
the
tongue
of
Demosthenes
or
Cicero
,
that
may
have
enable
me
to
celebrate
the
praise
of
my
own
dear
native
country
in
a
style
equal
to
its
merit
and
felicity
.
  
<EOS>
I
begin
my
discourse
by
inform
his
majesty
,
that
our
dominion
consist
of
two
island
,
which
compose
three
mighty
kingdom
,
under
one
sovereign
,
beside
our
plantation
in
America
.
 
<EOS>
I
dwelt
long
upon
the
fertility
of
our
soil
,
and
the
temperature
of
our
climate
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
speak
at
large
upon
the
constitution
of
an
english
parliament
;
partly
make
up
of
an
illustrious
body
call
the
House
of
Peers
;
person
of
the
noble
blood
,
and
of
the
most
ancient
and
ample
patrimony
.
 
<EOS>
I
describe
that
extraordinary
care
always
take
of
their
education
in
art
and
arm
,
to
qualify
them
for
be
counsellor
both
to
the
king
and
kingdom
;
to
have
a
share
in
the
legislature
;
to
be
member
of
the
high
court
of
judicature
,
whence
there
can
be
no
appeal
;
and
to
be
champion
always
ready
for
the
defence
of
their
prince
and
country
,
by
their
valour
,
conduct
,
and
fidelity
.
 
<EOS>
that
these
be
the
ornament
and
bulwark
of
the
kingdom
,
worthy
follower
of
their
most
renowned
ancestor
,
whose
honour
have
be
the
reward
of
their
virtue
,
from
which
their
posterity
be
never
once
know
to
degenerate
.
 
<EOS>
to
these
be
join
several
holy
person
,
as
part
of
that
assembly
,
under
the
title
of
bishop
,
whose
peculiar
business
be
to
take
care
of
religion
,
and
of
those
who
instruct
the
people
therein
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
search
and
seek
out
through
the
whole
nation
,
by
the
prince
and
his
wisest
counsellor
,
among
such
of
the
priesthood
as
be
most
deservedly
distinguish
by
the
sanctity
of
their
life
,
and
the
depth
of
their
erudition
;
who
be
indeed
the
spiritual
father
of
the
clergy
and
the
people
.
  
<EOS>
that
the
other
part
of
the
parliament
consist
of
an
assembly
call
the
House
of
Commons
,
who
be
all
principal
gentleman
,
freely
pick
and
cull
out
by
the
people
themselves
,
for
their
great
ability
and
love
of
their
country
,
to
represent
the
wisdom
of
the
whole
nation
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
these
two
body
make
up
the
most
august
assembly
in
Europe
;
to
whom
,
in
conjunction
with
the
prince
,
the
whole
legislature
be
commit
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
descend
to
the
court
of
justice
;
over
which
the
judge
,
those
venerable
sage
and
interpreter
of
the
law
,
preside
,
for
determine
the
dispute
right
and
property
of
man
,
as
well
as
for
the
punishment
of
vice
and
protection
of
innocence
.
 
<EOS>
I
mention
the
prudent
management
of
our
treasury
;
the
valour
and
achievement
of
our
force
,
by
sea
and
land
.
 
<EOS>
I
compute
the
number
of
our
people
,
by
reckon
how
many
million
there
may
be
of
each
religious
sect
,
or
political
party
among
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
omit
even
our
sport
and
pastime
,
or
any
other
particular
which
I
think
may
redound
to
the
honour
of
my
country
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
finish
all
with
a
brief
historical
account
of
affair
and
event
in
England
for
about
a
hundred
year
past
.
  
<EOS>
this
conversation
be
not
end
under
five
audience
,
each
of
several
hour
;
and
the
king
hear
the
whole
with
great
attention
,
frequently
take
note
of
what
I
speak
,
as
well
as
memorandum
of
what
question
he
intend
to
ask
me
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
have
put
an
end
to
these
long
discource
,
his
majesty
,
in
a
sixth
audience
,
consult
his
note
,
propose
many
doubt
,
query
,
and
objection
,
upon
every
article
.
 
<EOS>
He
ask
,
"
what
method
be
use
to
cultivate
the
mind
and
body
of
our
young
nobility
,
and
in
what
kind
of
business
they
commonly
spend
the
first
and
teachable
part
of
their
life
?
 
<EOS>
what
course
be
take
to
supply
that
assembly
,
when
any
noble
family
become
extinct
?
 
<EOS>
what
qualification
be
necessary
in
those
who
be
to
be
create
new
lord
:
 
whether
the
humour
of
the
prince
,
a
sum
of
money
to
a
court
lady
,
or
a
design
of
strengthen
a
party
opposite
to
the
public
interest
,
ever
happen
to
be
the
motive
in
those
advancement
?
<EOS>
what
share
of
knowledge
these
lord
have
in
the
law
of
their
country
,
and
how
they
come
by
it
,
so
as
to
enable
them
to
decide
the
property
of
their
fellow
-
subject
in
the
last
resort
?
<EOS>
whether
they
be
always
so
free
from
avarice
,
partiality
,
or
want
,
that
a
bribe
,
or
some
other
sinister
view
,
could
have
no
place
among
them
?
 
<EOS>
whether
those
holy
lord
I
speak
of
be
always
promote
to
that
rank
upon
account
of
their
knowledge
in
religious
matter
,
and
the
sanctity
of
their
life
;
have
never
be
complier
with
the
time
,
while
they
be
common
priest
;
or
slavish
prostitute
chaplain
to
some
nobleman
,
whose
opinion
they
continue
servilely
to
follow
,
after
they
be
admit
into
that
assembly
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
then
desire
to
know
,
"
what
art
be
practise
in
elect
those
whom
I
call
commoner
:
 
whether
a
stranger
,
with
a
strong
purse
,
may
not
influence
the
vulgar
voter
to
choose
him
before
their
own
landlord
,
or
the
most
considerable
gentleman
in
the
neighbourhood
?
 
<EOS>
how
it
come
to
pass
,
that
people
be
so
violently
bent
upon
get
into
this
assembly
,
which
I
allow
to
be
a
great
trouble
and
expense
,
often
to
the
ruin
of
their
family
,
without
any
salary
or
pension
?
<EOS>
because
this
appear
such
an
exalted
strain
of
virtue
and
public
spirit
,
that
his
majesty
seem
to
doubt
it
may
possibly
not
be
always
sincere
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
he
desire
to
know
,
"
whether
such
zealous
gentleman
could
have
any
view
of
refund
themselves
for
the
charge
and
trouble
they
be
at
by
sacrifice
the
public
good
to
the
design
of
a
weak
and
vicious
prince
,
in
conjunction
with
a
corrupt
ministry
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
multiply
his
question
,
and
sift
me
thoroughly
upon
every
part
of
this
head
,
propose
numberless
inquiry
and
objection
,
which
I
think
it
not
prudent
or
convenient
to
repeat
.
  
<EOS>
upon
what
I
say
in
relation
to
our
court
of
justice
,
his
majesty
desire
to
be
satisfied
in
several
point
:
 
and
this
<EOS>
I
be
the
better
able
to
do
,
have
be
formerly
almost
ruin
by
a
long
suit
in
chancery
,
which
be
decree
for
me
with
cost
.
 
<EOS>
He
ask
,
"
what
time
be
usually
spend
in
determine
between
right
and
wrong
,
and
what
degree
of
expense
?
 
<EOS>
whether
advocate
and
orator
have
liberty
to
plead
in
cause
manifestly
know
to
be
unjust
,
vexatious
,
or
oppressive
?
 
<EOS>
whether
party
,
in
religion
or
politic
,
be
observe
to
be
of
any
weight
in
the
scale
of
justice
?
 
<EOS>
whether
those
plead
orator
be
person
educate
in
the
general
knowledge
of
equity
,
or
only
in
provincial
,
national
,
and
other
local
custom
?
 
<EOS>
whether
they
or
their
judge
have
any
part
in
pen
those
law
,
which
they
assume
the
liberty
of
interpreting
,
and
gloss
upon
at
their
pleasure
?
 
<EOS>
whether
they
have
ever
,
at
different
time
,
plead
for
and
against
the
same
cause
,
and
cite
precedent
to
prove
contrary
opinion
?
 
<EOS>
whether
they
be
a
rich
or
a
poor
corporation
?
 
<EOS>
whether
they
receive
any
pecuniary
reward
for
plead
,
or
deliver
their
opinion
?
 
<EOS>
and
particularly
,
whether
they
be
ever
admit
as
member
in
the
low
senate
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
fall
next
upon
the
management
of
our
treasury
;
and
say
,
"
he
think
my
memory
have
fail
me
,
because
I
compute
our
taxis
at
about
five
or
six
million
a
-
year
,
and
when
I
come
to
mention
the
issue
,
he
find
they
sometimes
amount
to
more
than
double
;
for
the
note
he
have
take
be
very
particular
in
this
point
,
because
he
hope
,
as
he
tell
me
,
that
the
knowledge
of
our
conduct
may
be
useful
to
him
,
and
he
could
not
be
deceive
in
his
calculation
.
<EOS>
but
,
if
what
I
tell
him
be
true
,
he
be
still
at
a
loss
how
a
kingdom
could
run
out
of
its
estate
,
like
a
private
person
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
ask
me
,
"
who
be
our
creditor
;
and
where
we
find
money
to
pay
them
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
wonder
to
hear
me
talk
of
such
chargeable
and
expensive
war
;
"
that
certainly
we
must
be
a
quarrelsome
people
,
or
live
among
very
bad
neighbour
,
and
that
our
general
must
need
be
rich
than
our
king
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
ask
,
what
business
we
have
out
of
our
own
island
,
unless
upon
the
score
of
trade
,
or
treaty
,
or
to
defend
the
coast
with
our
fleet
?
"
 
<EOS>
above
all
,
he
be
amazed
to
hear
me
talk
of
a
mercenary
standing
army
,
in
the
midst
of
peace
,
and
among
a
free
people
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
if
we
be
govern
by
our
own
consent
,
in
the
person
of
our
representative
,
he
could
not
imagine
of
whom
we
be
afraid
,
or
against
whom
we
be
to
fight
;
and
would
hear
my
opinion
,
whether
a
private
man
's
house
may
not
be
better
defend
by
himself
,
his
child
,
and
family
,
than
by
half
-
a
-
dozen
rascal
,
pick
up
at
a
venture
in
the
street
for
small
wage
,
who
may
get
a
hundred
time
more
by
cut
their
throat
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
laugh
at
my
"
odd
kind
of
arithmetic
,
"
as
he
be
pleased
to
call
it
,
"
in
reckon
the
number
of
our
people
,
by
a
computation
draw
from
the
several
sect
among
us
,
in
religion
and
politic
.
"
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
he
know
no
reason
why
those
,
who
entertain
opinion
prejudicial
to
the
public
,
should
be
oblige
to
change
,
or
should
not
be
oblige
to
conceal
them
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
it
be
tyranny
in
any
government
to
require
the
first
,
so
it
be
weakness
not
to
enforce
the
second
:
 
for
a
man
may
be
allow
to
keep
poison
in
his
closet
,
but
not
to
vend
them
about
for
cordial
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
observe
,
"
that
among
the
diversion
of
our
nobility
and
gentry
,
I
have
mention
gaming
:
 
he
desire
to
know
at
what
age
this
entertainment
be
usually
take
up
,
and
when
it
be
lay
down
;
how
much
of
their
time
it
employ
;
whether
it
ever
go
so
high
as
to
affect
their
fortune
;
whether
mean
,
vicious
people
,
by
their
dexterity
in
that
art
,
may
not
arrive
at
great
rich
,
and
sometimes
keep
our
very
noble
in
dependence
,
as
well
as
habituate
them
to
vile
companion
,
wholly
take
them
from
the
improvement
of
their
mind
,
and
force
them
,
by
the
loss
they
receive
,
to
learn
and
practise
that
infamous
dexterity
upon
other
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
perfectly
astonish
with
the
historical
account
give
him
of
our
affair
during
the
last
century
;
protest
"
it
be
only
a
heap
of
conspiracy
,
rebellion
,
murder
,
massacre
,
revolution
,
banishment
,
the
very
bad
effect
that
avarice
,
faction
,
hypocrisy
,
perfidiousness
,
cruelty
,
rage
,
madness
,
hatred
,
envy
,
lust
,
malice
,
and
ambition
,
could
produce
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
majesty
,
in
another
audience
,
be
at
the
pain
to
recapitulate
the
sum
of
all
I
have
speak
;
compare
the
question
he
make
with
the
answer
I
have
give
;
then
take
me
into
his
hand
,
and
stroke
me
gently
,
deliver
himself
in
these
word
,
which
I
shall
never
forget
,
nor
the
manner
he
speak
them
in
:
 
<EOS>
"
My
little
friend
Grildrig
,
you
have
make
a
most
admirable
panegyric
upon
your
country
;
you
have
clearly
prove
,
that
ignorance
,
idleness
,
and
vice
,
be
the
proper
ingredient
for
qualify
a
legislator
;
that
law
be
best
explain
,
interpret
,
and
apply
,
by
those
whose
interest
and
ability
lie
in
pervert
,
confound
,
and
elude
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
observe
among
you
some
line
of
an
institution
,
which
,
in
its
original
,
may
have
be
tolerable
,
but
these
half
erased
,
and
the
rest
wholly
blur
and
blot
by
corruption
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
not
appear
,
from
all
you
have
say
,
how
any
one
perfection
be
require
toward
the
procurement
of
any
one
station
among
you
;
much
less
,
that
man
be
ennoble
on
account
of
their
virtue
;
that
priest
be
advanced
for
their
piety
or
learning
;
soldier
,
for
their
conduct
or
valour
;
judge
,
for
their
integrity
;
senator
,
for
the
love
of
their
country
;
or
counsellor
for
their
wisdom
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
yourself
,
"
continue
the
king
,
"
who
have
spend
the
great
part
of
your
life
in
travel
,
I
be
well
disposed
to
hope
you
may
hitherto
have
escape
many
vice
of
your
country
.
 
<EOS>
but
by
what
I
have
gather
from
your
own
relation
,
and
the
answer
I
have
with
much
pain
wrung
and
extort
from
you
,
I
can
not
but
conclude
the
bulk
of
your
native
to
be
the
most
pernicious
race
of
little
odious
vermin
that
nature
ever
suffer
to
crawl
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
author
's
love
of
his
country
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
a
proposal
of
much
advantage
to
the
king
,
which
be
reject
.
 
<EOS>
the
king
's
great
ignorance
in
politic
.
 
<EOS>
the
learning
of
that
country
very
imperfect
and
confine
.
 
<EOS>
the
law
,
and
military
affair
,
and
party
in
the
state
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
but
an
extreme
love
of
truth
could
have
hinder
me
from
conceal
this
part
of
my
story
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
to
discover
my
resentment
,
which
be
always
turn
into
ridicule
;
and
I
be
force
to
rest
with
patience
,
while
my
noble
and
beloved
country
be
so
injuriously
treat
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
as
heartily
sorry
as
any
of
my
reader
can
possibly
be
,
that
such
an
occasion
be
give
:
 
<EOS>
but
this
prince
happen
to
be
so
curious
and
inquisitive
upon
every
particular
,
that
it
could
not
consist
either
with
gratitude
or
good
manner
,
to
refuse
give
him
what
satisfaction
<EOS>
I
be
able
.
 
<EOS>
yet
thus
much
I
may
be
allow
to
say
in
my
own
vindication
<EOS>
,
that
I
artfully
elude
many
of
his
question
,
and
give
to
every
point
a
more
favourable
turn
,
by
many
degree
,
than
the
strictness
of
truth
would
allow
.
 
<EOS>
for
I
have
always
bear
that
laudable
partiality
to
my
own
country
,
which
Dionysius
Halicarnassensis
,
with
so
much
justice
,
recommend
to
an
historian
:
 
<EOS>
I
would
hide
the
frailty
and
deformity
of
my
political
mother
,
and
place
her
virtue
and
beauty
in
the
most
advantageous
light
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
my
sincere
endeavour
in
those
many
discourse
I
have
with
that
monarch
,
although
it
unfortunately
fail
of
success
.
  
<EOS>
but
great
allowance
should
be
give
to
a
king
,
who
live
wholly
seclude
from
the
rest
of
the
world
,
and
must
therefore
be
altogether
unacquainted
with
the
manner
and
custom
that
most
prevail
in
other
nation
:
 
the
want
of
which
knowledge
will
ever
produce
many
prejudice
,
and
a
certain
narrowness
of
thinking
,
from
which
we
,
and
the
politer
country
of
Europe
,
be
wholly
exempt
.
<EOS>
and
it
would
be
hard
indeed
,
if
so
remote
a
prince
's
notion
of
virtue
and
vice
be
to
be
offer
as
a
standard
for
all
mankind
.
  
<EOS>
to
confirm
what
I
have
now
say
,
and
further
to
show
the
miserable
effect
of
a
confine
education
,
I
shall
here
insert
a
passage
,
which
will
hardly
obtain
belief
.
 
<EOS>
in
hope
to
ingratiate
myself
further
into
his
majesty
's
favour
,
I
tell
him
of
"
an
invention
,
discover
between
three
and
four
hundred
year
ago
,
to
make
a
certain
powder
,
into
a
heap
of
which
,
the
small
spark
of
fire
fall
,
would
kindle
the
whole
in
a
moment
,
although
it
be
as
big
as
a
mountain
,
and
make
it
all
fly
up
in
the
air
together
,
with
a
noise
and
agitation
great
than
thunder
.
 
<EOS>
that
a
proper
quantity
of
this
powder
ram
into
a
hollow
tube
of
brass
or
iron
,
accord
to
its
bigness
,
would
drive
a
ball
of
iron
or
lead
,
with
such
violence
and
speed
,
as
nothing
be
able
to
sustain
its
force
.
<EOS>
that
the
large
ball
thus
discharge
,
would
not
only
destroy
whole
rank
of
an
army
at
once
,
but
batter
the
strong
wall
to
the
ground
,
sink
down
ship
,
with
a
thousand
man
in
each
,
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
,
and
when
link
together
by
a
chain
,
would
cut
through
mast
and
rigging
,
divide
hundred
of
body
in
the
middle
,
and
lie
all
waste
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
that
we
often
put
this
powder
into
large
hollow
ball
of
iron
,
and
discharge
them
by
an
engine
into
some
city
we
be
besiege
,
which
would
rip
up
the
pavement
,
tear
the
house
to
piece
,
burst
and
throw
splinter
on
every
side
,
dash
out
the
brain
of
all
who
come
near
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
know
the
ingredient
very
well
,
which
be
cheap
and
common
;
I
understand
the
manner
of
compound
them
,
and
could
direct
his
workman
how
to
make
those
tube
,
of
a
size
proportionable
to
all
other
thing
in
his
majesty
's
kingdom
,
and
the
large
need
not
be
above
a
hundred
foot
long
;
twenty
or
thirty
of

tube

charge
with
the

powder

batter
down
the

in
his
dominion
in

hour

destroy
the

metropolis

if
ever
it
should
pretend
to
dispute
his
absolute
command

"
 
<EOS>
this
I
humbly
offer
to
his
majesty
,
as
a
small
tribute
of
acknowledgment
,
in
turn
for
so
many
mark
that
I
have
receive
,
of
his
royal
favour
and
protection
.
  
<EOS>
the
king
be
strike
with
horror
at
the
description
I
have
give
of
those
terrible
engine
,
and
the
proposal
I
have
make
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
amazed
,
how
so
impotent
and
grovel
an
insect
as
I
"
(
these
be
his
expression
)
"
could
entertain
such
inhuman
idea
,
and
in
so
familiar
a
manner
,
as
to
appear
wholly
unmoved
at
all
the
scene
of
blood
and
desolation
which
I
have
paint
as
the
common
effect
of
those
destructive
machine
;
whereof
<EOS>
,
"
he
say
,
"
some
evil
genius
,
enemy
to
mankind
,
must
have
be
the
first
contriver
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
himself
,
he
protest
,
that
although
few
thing
delight
him
so
much
as
new
discovery
in
art
or
in
nature
,
yet
he
would
rather
lose
half
his
kingdom
,
than
be
privy
to
such
a
secret
;
which
he
command
me
,
as
I
value
any
life
,
never
to
mention
any
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
strange
effect
of
narrow
principle
and
view
!
<EOS>
that
a
prince
possess
of
every
quality
which
procure
veneration
,
love
,
and
esteem
;
of
strong
part
,
great
wisdom
,
and
profound
learning
,
endow
with
admirable
talent
,
and
almost
adore
by
his
subject
,
should
,
from
a
nice
,
unnecessary
scruple
,
whereof
in
Europe
<EOS>
we
can
have
no
conception
,
let
slip
an
opportunity
put
into
his
hand
that
would
have
make
him
absolute
master
of
the
life
,
the
liberty
,
and
the
fortune
of
his
people
!
 
<EOS>
neither
<EOS>
do
I
say
this
,
with
the
least
intention
to
detract
from
the
many
virtue
of
that
excellent
king
,
whose
character
,
I
be
sensible
,
will
,
on
this
account
,
be
very
much
lessen
in
the
opinion
of
an
english
reader
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
take
this
defect
among
them
to
have
rise
from
their
ignorance
,
by
not
have
hitherto
reduce
politic
into
a
science
,
as
the
more
acute
wit
of
Europe
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
for
<EOS>
,
I
remember
very
well
,
in
a
discourse
one
day
with
the
king
,
when
I
happen
to
say
,
"
there
be
several
thousand
book
among
us
write
upon
the
art
of
government
,
"
it
give
him
(
directly
contrary
to
my
intention
)
a
very
mean
opinion
of
our
understanding
.
 
<EOS>
He
profess
both
to
abominate
and
despise
all
mystery
,
refinement
,
and
intrigue
,
either
in
a
prince
or
a
minister
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
tell
what
I
mean
by
secret
of
state
,
where
an
enemy
,
or
some
rival
nation
,
be
not
in
the
case
.
<EOS>
He
confine
the
knowledge
of
govern
within
very
narrow
bound
,
to
common
sense
and
reason
,
to
justice
and
lenity
,
to
the
speedy
determination
of
civil
and
criminal
cause
;
with
some
other
obvious
topic
,
which
be
not
worth
consider
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
give
it
for
his
opinion
,
"
that
whoever
could
make
two
ear
of
corn
,
or
two
blade
of
grass
,
to
grow
upon
a
spot
of
ground
where
only
one
grow
before
,
would
deserve
well
of
mankind
,
and
do
more
essential
service
to
his
country
,
than
the
whole
race
of
politician
put
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
learning
of
this
people
be
very
defective
,
consist
only
in
morality
,
history
,
poetry
,
and
mathematic
,
wherein
they
must
be
allow
to
excel
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
last
of
these
be
wholly
apply
to
what
may
be
useful
in
life
,
to
the
improvement
of
agriculture
,
and
all
mechanical
art
;
so
that
among
us
,
it
would
be
little
esteem
.
<EOS>
and
as
to
idea
,
entity
,
abstraction
,
and
transcendental
,
I
could
never
drive
the
least
conception
into
their
head
.
  
<EOS>
no
law
in
that
country
must
exceed
in
word
the
number
of
letter
in
their
alphabet
,
which
consist
only
of
two
and
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
but
indeed
few
of
them
extend
even
to
that
length
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
express
in
the
most
plain
and
simple
term
,
wherein
those
people
be
not
mercurial
enough
to
discover
above
one
interpretation
:
 
and
to
write
a
comment
upon
any
law
,
be
a
capital
crime
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
decision
of
civil
cause
,
or
proceeding
against
criminal
,
their
precedent
be
so
few
,
that
they
have
little
reason
to
boast
of
any
extraordinary
skill
in
either
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
have
the
art
of
printing
,
as
well
as
the
Chinese
,
time
out
of
mind
:
 
but
their
library
be
not
very
large
;
for
that
of
the
king
,
which
be
reckon
the
large
,
do
not
amount
to
above
a
thousand
volume
,
place
in
a
gallery
of
twelve
hundred
foot
long
,
<EOS>
whence
<EOS>
I
have
liberty
to
borrow
what
book
I
please
.
 
<EOS>
the
queen
's
joiner
have
contrive
in
one
of
Glumdalclitch
's
room
,
a
kind
of
wooden
machine
five
-
and
-
twenty
foot
high
,
form
like
a
standing
ladder
;
the
step
be
each
fifty
foot
long
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
a
moveable
pair
of
stair
,
the
low
end
place
at
ten
foot
distance
from
the
wall
of
the
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
the
book
I
have
a
mind
to
read
,
be
put
up
lean
against
the
wall
:
 
<EOS>
I
first
mount
to
the
upper
step
of
the
ladder
,
and
turn
my
face
towards
the
book
,
begin
at
the
top
of
the
page
,
and
so
walk
to
the
right
and
leave
about
eight
or
ten
pace
,
accord
to
the
length
of
the
line
,
till
I
have
get
a
little
below
the
level
of
mine
eye
,
and
then
descend
gradually
till
I
come
to
the
bottom
:
 
after
which
I
mount
again
,
and
begin
the
other
page
in
the
same
manner
,
and
so
turn
over
the
leaf
,
which
I
could
easily
do
with
both
my
hand
,
for
it
be
as
thick
and
stiff
as
a
pasteboard
,
and
in
the
large
folio
not
above
eighteen
or
twenty
foot
long
.
  
<EOS>
Their
style
be
clear
,
masculine
,
and
smooth
,
but
not
florid
;
for
they
avoid
nothing
more
than
multiply
unnecessary
word
,
or
use
various
expression
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
peruse
many
of
their
book
,
especially
those
in
history
and
morality
.
 
<EOS>
among
the
rest
,
I
be
much
divert
with
a
little
old
treatise
,
which
always
lie
in
Glumdalclitch
's
bed
chamber
,
and
belong
to
her
governess
,
a
grave
elderly
gentlewoman
,
who
deal
in
writing
of
morality
and
devotion
.
 
<EOS>
the
book
treat
of
the
weakness
of
human
kind
,
and
be
in
little
esteem
,
except
among
the
woman
and
the
vulgar
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
be
curious
to
see
what
an
author
of
that
country
could
say
upon
such
a
subject
.
 
<EOS>
this
writer
go
through
all
the
usual
topic
of
european
moralist
,
show
"
how
diminutive
,
contemptible
,
and
helpless
an
animal
be
man
in
his
own
nature
;
how
unable
to
defend
himself
from
inclemency
of
the
air
,
or
the
fury
of
wild
beast
:
how
much
he
be
excel
by
one
creature
in
strength
,
by
another
in
speed
,
by
a
third
in
foresight
,
by
a
fourth
in
industry
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
add
,
"
that
nature
be
degenerate
in
these
latter
decline
age
of
the
world
,
and
could
now
produce
only
small
abortive
birth
,
in
comparison
of
those
in
ancient
time
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
say
"
it
be
very
reasonable
to
think
,
not
only
that
the
specie
of
man
be
originally
much
large
,
but
also
that
there
must
have
be
giant
in
former
age
;
which
,
as
it
be
assert
by
history
and
tradition
,
so
it
have
be
confirm
by
huge
bone
and
skull
,
casually
dig
up
in
several
part
of
the
kingdom
,
far
exceed
the
common
dwindle
race
of
man
in
our
day
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
argue
,
"
that
the
very
law
of
nature
absolutely
require
we
should
have
be
make
,
in
the
beginning
of
a
size
more
large
and
robust
;
not
so
liable
to
destruction
from
every
little
accident
,
of
a
tile
fall
from
a
house
,
or
a
stone
cast
from
the
hand
of
a
boy
,
or
be
drown
in
a
little
brook
.
"
 
<EOS>
from
this
way
of
reasoning
,
the
author
draw
several
moral
application
,
useful
in
the
conduct
of
life
,
but
needless
here
to
repeat
.
 
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
could
not
avoid
reflect
how
universally
this
talent
be
spread
,
of
draw
lecture
in
morality
,
or
indeed
rather
matter
of
discontent
and
repine
,
from
the
quarrel
we
raise
with
nature
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
believe
,
upon
a
strict
inquiry
,
those
quarrel
may
be
show
as
ill
-
ground
among
us
as
they
be
among
that
people
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
their
military
affair
,
they
boast
that
the
king
's
army
consist
of
a
hundred
and
seventy
-
six
thousand
foot
,
and
thirty
-
two
thousand
horse
:
 
if
that
may
be
call
an
army
,
which
be
make
up
of
tradesman
in
the
several
city
,
and
farmer
in
the
country
,
whose
commander
be
only
the
nobility
and
gentry
,
without
pay
or
reward
.
<EOS>
They
be
indeed
perfect
enough
in
their
exercise
,
and
under
very
good
discipline
,
wherein
I
see
no
great
merit
;
for
how
should
it
be
otherwise
,
where
every
farmer
be
under
the
command
of
his
own
landlord
,
and
every
citizen
under
that
of
the
principal
man
in
his
own
city
,
choose
after
the
manner
of
Venice
,
by
ballot
?
  
<EOS>
I
have
often
see
the
militia
of
Lorbrulgrud
draw
out
to
exercise
,
in
a
great
field
near
the
city
of
twenty
mile
square
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
in
all
not
above
twenty
-
five
thousand
foot
,
and
six
thousand
horse
;
but
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
compute
their
number
,
consider
the
space
of
ground
they
take
up
.
 
<EOS>
a
cavalier
,
mount
on
a
large
steed
,
may
be
about
ninety
foot
high
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
this
whole
body
of
horse
,
upon
a
word
of
command
,
draw
their
sword
at
once
,
and
brandish
them
in
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
imagination
can
figure
nothing
so
grand
,
so
surprising
,
and
so
astonishing
!
<EOS>
it
look
as
if
ten
thousand
flash
of
lightning
be
dart
at
the
same
time
from
every
quarter
of
the
sky
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
curious
to
know
how
this
prince
,
to
whose
dominion
there
be
no
access
from
any
other
country
,
come
to
think
of
army
,
or
to
teach
his
people
the
practice
of
military
discipline
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
soon
inform
,
both
by
conversation
and
read
their
history
;
for
,
in
the
course
of
many
age
,
they
have
be
trouble
with
the
same
disease
to
which
the
whole
race
of
mankind
be
subject
;
the
nobility
often
contend
for
power
,
the
people
for
liberty
,
and
the
king
for
absolute
dominion
.
 
<EOS>
all
which
,
however
happily
temper
by
the
law
of
that
kingdom
,
have
be
sometimes
violate
by
each
of
the
three
party
,
and
have
more
than
once
occasion
civil
war
;
the
last
whereof
be
happily
put
an
end
to
by
this
prince
's
grand
-
father
,
in
a
general
composition
;
and
the
militia
,
then
settle
with
common
consent
,
have
be
ever
since
keep
in
the
strict
duty
.
   
<EOS>
the
king
and
queen
make
a
progress
to
the
frontier
.
 
<EOS>
the
author
attend
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
manner
in
which
he
leave
the
country
very
particularly
relate
.
 
<EOS>
He
return
to
England
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
always
a
strong
impulse
that
I
should
some
time
recover
my
liberty
,
though
it
be
impossible
to
conjecture
by
what
mean
,
or
to
form
any
project
with
the
least
hope
of
succeed
.
 
<EOS>
the
ship
in
which
I
sail
,
be
the
first
ever
know
to
be
drive
within
sight
of
that
coast
,
and
the
king
have
give
strict
order
,
that
if
at
any
time
another
appear
,
it
should
be
take
ashore
,
and
with
all
its
crew
and
passenger
bring
in
a
tumbril
to
Lorbrulgrud
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
strongly
bent
to
get
me
a
woman
of
my
own
size
,
by
whom
I
may
propagate
the
breed
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
think
I
should
rather
have
die
than
undergo
the
disgrace
of
leave
a
posterity
to
be
keep
in
cage
,
like
tame
canary
-
bird
,
and
perhaps
,
in
time
,
sell
about
the
kingdom
,
to
person
of
quality
,
for
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
indeed
treat
with
much
kindness
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
the
favourite
of
a
great
king
and
queen
,
and
the
delight
of
the
whole
court
;
but
it
be
upon
such
a
foot
as
ill
<EOS>
become
the
dignity
of
humankind
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
never
forget
those
domestic
pledge
I
have
leave
behind
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
be
among
people
,
with
whom
I
could
converse
upon
even
term
,
and
walk
about
the
street
and
field
without
be
afraid
of
be
trod
to
death
like
a
frog
or
a
young
puppy
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
deliverance
come
sooner
than
I
expect
,
and
in
a
manner
not
very
common
;
the
whole
story
and
circumstance
of
which
I
shall
faithfully
relate
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
now
be
two
year
in
this
country
;
and
about
the
beginning
of
the
third
,
Glumdalclitch
and
I
attend
the
king
and
queen
,
in
a
progress
to
the
south
coast
of
the
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
carry
,
as
usual
,
in
my
travelling
-
box
,
which
as
I
have
already
describe
,
be
a
very
convenient
closet
,
of
twelve
foot
wide
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
order
a
hammock
to
be
fix
,
by
silken
rope
from
the
four
corner
at
the
top
,
to
break
the
jolt
,
when
a
servant
carry
me
before
him
on
horseback
,
as
I
sometimes
desire
;
and
would
often
sleep
in
my
hammock
,
while
we
be
upon
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
roof
of
my
closet
,
not
directly
over
the
middle
of
the
hammock
,
I
order
the
joiner
to
cut
out
a
hole
of
a
foot
square
,
to
give
me
air
in
hot
weather
,
as
I
sleep
;
which
hole
I
shut
at
pleasure
with
a
board
that
draw
backward
and
forward
through
a
groove
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
our
journey
's
end
,
the
king
think
proper
to
pass
a
few
day
at
a
palace
he
have
near
Flanflasnic
,
a
city
within
eighteen
english
mile
of
the
seaside
.
 
<EOS>
glumdalclitch
<EOS>
and
I
be
much
fatigue
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
get
a
small
cold
,
but
the
poor
girl
be
so
ill
as
to
be
confine
to
her
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
I
long
to
see
the
ocean
,
which
must
be
the
only
scene
of
my
escape
,
if
ever
it
should
happen
.
 
<EOS>
I
pretend
to
be
bad
than
I
really
be
,
and
desire
leave
to
take
the
fresh
air
of
the
sea
,
with
a
page
,
whom
I
be
very
fond
of
,
and
who
have
sometimes
be
trust
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
with
what
unwillingness
Glumdalclitch
consent
,
nor
the
strict
charge
she
give
the
page
to
be
careful
of
me
,
burst
at
the
same
time
into
a
flood
of
tear
,
as
if
she
have
some
forboding
of
what
be
to
happen
.
 
<EOS>
the
boy
take
me
out
in
my
box
,
about
half
an
hour
walk
from
the
palace
,
towards
the
rock
on
the
sea
-
shore
.
 
<EOS>
I
order
him
to
set
me
down
,
and
lift
up
one
of
my
sash
,
cast
many
a
wistful
melancholy
look
towards
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
myself
not
very
well
,
and
tell
the
page
that
I
have
a
mind
to
take
a
nap
in
my
hammock
,
which
I
hope
would
do
me
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
in
,
and
the
boy
shut
the
window
close
down
,
to
keep
out
the
cold
.
<EOS>
I
soon
fall
asleep
,
and
all
I
can
conjecture
be
,
while
I
sleep
,
the
page
,
think
no
danger
could
happen
,
go
among
the
rock
to
look
for
bird
'
egg
,
have
before
observe
him
from
my
window
search
about
,
and
pick
up
one
or
two
in
the
cleft
.
 
<EOS>
be
that
as
it
will
,
I
find
myself
suddenly
awake
with
a
violent
pull
upon
the
ring
,
which
be
fasten
at
the
top
of
my
box
for
the
conveniency
of
carriage
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
my
box
raise
very
high
in
the
air
,
and
then
borne
forward
with
prodigious
speed
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
jolt
have
like
to
have
shake
me
out
of
my
hammock
,
but
afterward
the
motion
be
easy
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
call
out
several
time
,
as
loud
as
I
could
raise
my
voice
,
but
all
to
no
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
towards
my
window
,
and
could
see
nothing
but
the
cloud
and
sky
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
a
noise
just
over
my
head
,
like
the
clapping
of
wing
,
and
then
begin
to
perceive
the
woful
condition
I
be
in
;
that
some
eagle
have
get
the
ring
of
my
box
in
his
beak
,
with
an
intent
to
let
it
fall
on
a
rock
,
like
a
tortoise
in
a
shell
,
and
then
pick
out
my
body
,
and
devour
it
:
 
for
the
sagacity
and
smell
of
this
bird
<EOS>
enable
him
to
discover
his
quarry
at
a
great
distance
,
though
better
conceal
than
I
could
be
within
a
two
-
inch
board
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
little
time
,
I
observe
the
noise
and
flutter
of
wing
to
increase
very
fast
,
and
my
box
be
toss
up
and
down
,
like
a
sign
in
a
windy
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
several
bang
or
buffet
,
as
I
think
give
to
the
eagle
(
for
such
I
be
certain
it
must
have
be
that
hold
the
ring
of
my
box
in
his
beak
)
,
and
then
,
all
on
a
sudden
,
feel
myself
fall
perpendicularly
down
,
for
above
a
minute
,
but
with
such
incredible
swiftness
,
that
I
almost
lose
my
breath
.
 
<EOS>
My
fall
be
stop
by
a
terrible
squash
,
<EOS>
that
sound
louder
to
my
ear
than
the
cataract
of
Niagara
;
after
which
,
I
be
quite
in
the
dark
for
another
minute
,
and
then
my
box
begin
to
rise
so
high
,
that
I
could
see
light
from
the
top
of
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
I
now
perceive
I
be
fall
into
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
My
box
,
by
the
weight
of
my
body
,
the
good
that
be
in
,
and
the
broad
plate
of
iron
fix
for
strength
at
the
four
corner
of
the
top
and
bottom
,
float
about
five
foot
deep
in
water
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
then
,
and
do
now
suppose
,
that
the
eagle
which
fly
away
with
my
box
be
pursue
by
two
or
three
other
,
and
force
to
let
me
drop
,
while
he
defend
himself
against
the
rest
,
who
hope
to
share
in
the
prey
.
 
<EOS>
the
plate
of
iron
fasten
at
the
bottom
of
the
box
(
for
those
be
the
strong
)
preserve
the
balance
while
it
fall
,
and
hinder
it
from
be
break
on
the
surface
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
every
joint
of
it
be
well
grooved
;
and
the
door
do
not
move
on
hinge
,
but
up
and
down
like
a
sash
,
which
keep
my
closet
so
tight
that
very
little
water
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
with
much
difficulty
out
of
my
hammock
,
have
first
venture
to
draw
back
the
slip
-
board
on
the
roof
already
mention
,
contrive
on
purpose
to
let
in
air
,
for
want
of
which
I
find
myself
almost
stifle
.
  
<EOS>
how
often
do
I
then
wish
myself
with
my
dear
glumdalclitch
,
from
whom
one
single
hour
have
so
far
divide
me
!
 
<EOS>
and
I
may
say
with
truth
,
that
in
the
midst
of
my
own
misfortune
I
could
not
forbear
lament
my
poor
nurse
,
the
grief
she
would
suffer
for
my
loss
,
the
displeasure
of
the
queen
,
and
the
ruin
of
her
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
many
traveller
have
not
be
under
great
difficulty
and
distress
than
I
be
at
this
juncture
,
expect
every
moment
to
see
my
box
dash
to
piece
,
or
at
least
overset
by
the
first
violent
blast
,
or
rise
wave
.
 
<EOS>
a
breach
in
one
single
pane
of
glass
would
have
be
immediate
death
:
 
nor
could
any
thing
have
preserve
the
window
,
but
the
strong
lattice
wire
place
on
the
outside
,
against
accident
in
travel
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
water
ooze
in
at
several
cranny
,
although
the
leak
be
not
considerable
,
and
I
endeavour
to
stop
them
as
well
as
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
able
to
lift
up
the
roof
of
my
closet
,
which
otherwise
I
certainly
should
have
do
,
and
sit
on
the
top
of
it
;
where
I
may
at
least
preserve
myself
some
hour
longer
,
than
by
be
shut
up
(
as
I
may
call
it
)
in
the
hold
.
 
<EOS>
or
if
I
escape
these
danger
for
a
day
or
two
,
what
could
I
expect
but
<EOS>
a
miserable
death
of
cold
and
hunger
?
<EOS>
I
be
four
hour
under
these
circumstance
,
expect
,
and
indeed
wish
,
every
moment
to
be
my
last
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
already
tell
the
reader
that
there
be
two
strong
staple
fix
upon
that
side
of
my
box
which
have
no
window
,
and
into
which
the
servant
,
who
use
to
carry
me
on
horseback
,
would
put
a
leathern
belt
,
and
buckle
it
about
his
waist
.
 
<EOS>
be
in
this
disconsolate
state
,
I
hear
,
or
at
least
think
I
hear
,
some
kind
of
grate
noise
on
that
side
of
my
box
where
the
staple
be
fix
;
and
soon
after
I
begin
to
fancy
that
the
box
be
pull
or
tow
along
the
sea
;
for
I
now
and
then
feel
a
sort
of
tugging
,
which
make
the
wave
rise
near
the
top
of
my
window
,
leave
me
almost
in
the
dark
.
 
<EOS>
this
give
me
some
faint
hope
of
relief
,
although
I
be
not
able
to
imagine
how
it
could
be
bring
about
.
<EOS>
I
venture
to
unscrew
one
of
my
chair
,
which
be
always
fasten
to
the
floor
;
and
have
make
a
hard
shift
to
screw
it
down
again
,
directly
under
the
slip
-
board
that
I
have
lately
open
,
I
mount
on
the
chair
,
and
put
my
mouth
as
near
as
I
could
to
the
hole
,
I
call
for
help
in
a
loud
voice
,
and
in
all
the
language
I
understand
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
fasten
my
handkerchief
to
a
stick
I
usually
carry
,
and
thrust
it
up
the
hole
,
wave
it
several
time
in
the
air
,
that
if
any
boat
or
ship
be
near
,
the
seaman
may
conjecture
some
unhappy
mortal
to
be
shut
up
in
the
box
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
no
effect
from
all
I
could
do
,
but
plainly
perceive
my
closet
to
be
move
along
;
and
in
the
space
of
an
hour
,
or
well
,
that
side
of
the
box
where
the
staple
be
,
and
have
no
window
,
strike
against
something
that
be
hard
.
 
<EOS>
I
apprehend
it
to
be
a
rock
,
and
find
myself
toss
more
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
I
plainly
hear
a
noise
upon
the
cover
of
my
closet
,
like
that
of
a
cable
,
and
the
grating
of
it
as
it
pass
through
the
ring
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
find
myself
hoisted
up
,
by
degree
,
at
least
three
foot
high
than
I
be
before
.
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
I
again
thrust
up
my
stick
and
handkerchief
,
call
for
help
till
I
be
almost
hoarse
.
 
<EOS>
in
return
to
which
,
I
hear
a
great
shout
repeat
three
time
,
give
me
such
transport
of
joy
as
be
not
to
be
conceive
but
by
those
who
feel
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
now
hear
a
trampling
over
my
head
,
and
<EOS>
somebody
call
through
the
hole
with
a
loud
voice
,
in
the
english
tongue
,
"
if
there
be
any
body
below
,
let
them
speak
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
answer
,
"
I
be
an
Englishman
,
draw
by
ill
fortune
into
the
great
calamity
that
ever
any
creature
undergo
,
and
beg
,
by
all
that
be
move
,
to
be
deliver
out
of
the
dungeon
I
be
in
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
voice
reply
,
"
I
be
safe
,
for
my
box
be
fasten
to
their
ship
;
and
the
carpenter
should
immediately
come
and
see
a
hole
in
the
cover
,
large
enough
to
pull
me
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
answer
,
"
that
be
needless
,
and
would
take
up
too
much
time
;
for
there
be
no
more
to
be
do
,
but
let
one
of
the
crew
put
his
finger
into
the
ring
,
and
take
the
box
out
of
the
sea
into
the
ship
,
and
so
into
the
captain
's
cabin
.
"
 
<EOS>
some
of
them
,
upon
hear
me
talk
so
wildly
,
think
I
be
mad
:
 
other
laugh
;
for
indeed
it
never
come
into
my
head
,
that
I
be
now
get
among
people
of
my
own
stature
and
strength
.
 
<EOS>
the
carpenter
come
,
and
in
a
few
minute
saw
a
passage
about
four
foot
square
,
then
let
down
a
small
ladder
,
upon
which
I
mount
,
and
thence
be
take
into
the
ship
in
a
very
weak
condition
.
  
<EOS>
the
sailor
be
all
in
amazement
,
and
ask
me
a
thousand
question
,
which
I
have
no
inclination
to
answer
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
equally
confound
at
the
sight
of
so
many
pigmy
,
for
such
I
take
them
to
be
,
after
have
so
long
accustomed
mine
eye
to
the
monstrous
object
I
have
leave
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
captain
,
Mr.
Thomas
Wilcocks
,
an
honest
worthy
Shropshire
man
,
observe
<EOS>
I
be
ready
to
faint
,
take
me
into
his
cabin
,
give
me
a
cordial
to
comfort
me
,
and
make
me
turn
in
upon
his
own
bed
,
advise
me
to
take
a
little
rest
,
of
which
I
have
great
need
.
 
<EOS>
before
I
go
to
sleep
,
I
give
him
to
understand
that
I
have
some
valuable
furniture
in
my
box
,
too
good
to
be
lose
:
 
a
fine
hammock
,
a
handsome
field
-
bed
,
two
chair
,
a
table
,
and
a
cabinet
;
that
my
closet
be
hang
on
all
side
,
or
rather
quilt
,
with
silk
and
cotton
;
that
if
he
would
let
one
of
the
crew
bring
my
closet
into
his
cabin
,
I
would
open
it
there
before
him
,
and
show
him
my
good
.
 
<EOS>
the
captain
,
hear
me
utter
these
absurdity
,
conclude
I
be
rave
;
however
(
I
suppose
to
pacify
me
)
<EOS>
he
promise
to
give
order
as
I
desire
,
and
go
upon
deck
,
send
some
of
his
man
down
into
my
closet
,
whence
(
as
I
afterwards
find
)
<EOS>
they
draw
up
all
my
good
,
and
strip
off
the
quilting
;
but
the
chair
,
cabinet
,
and
bedstead
,
be
screw
to
the
floor
,
be
much
damage
by
the
ignorance
of
the
seaman
,
who
tear
them
up
by
force
.
 
<EOS>
then
they
knock
off
some
of
the
board
for
the
use
of
the
ship
,
and
when
they
have
get
all
they
have
a
mind
for
,
let
the
hull
drop
into
the
sea
,
which
by
reason
of
many
breach
make
in
the
bottom
and
side
,
sink
to
right
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
I
be
glad
not
to
have
be
a
spectator
of
the
havoc
they
make
,
because
I
be
confident
it
would
have
sensibly
touch
me
,
by
bring
former
passage
into
my
mind
,
which
I
would
rather
have
forget
.
  
<EOS>
I
sleep
some
hour
,
but
perpetually
disturb
with
dream
of
the
place
I
have
leave
,
and
the
danger
I
have
escape
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
upon
wake
,
I
find
myself
much
recover
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
about
eight
o'clock
at
night
,
and
the
captain
order
supper
immediately
,
think
I
have
already
fast
too
long
.
 
<EOS>
He
entertain
me
with
great
kindness
,
observe
me
not
to
look
wildly
,
or
talk
inconsistently
:
 
and
,
when
we
be
leave
alone
,
desire
I
would
give
him
a
relation
of
my
travel
,
and
by
what
accident
I
come
to
be
set
adrift
,
in
that
monstrous
wooden
chest
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
"
that
about
twelve
o'clock
at
noon
,
as
he
be
look
through
his
glass
,
he
spy
it
at
a
distance
,
and
think
it
be
a
sail
,
which
he
have
a
mind
to
make
,
be
not
much
out
of
his
course
,
in
hope
of
buy
some
biscuit
,
his
own
beginning
to
fall
short
.
 
<EOS>
that
upon
come
nearer
,
and
find
his
error
,
he
send
out
his
long
-
boat
to
discover
what
it
be
;
that
his
man
come
back
in
a
fright
,
swear
they
have
see
a
swimming
house
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
laugh
at
their
folly
,
and
go
himself
in
the
boat
,
order
his
man
to
take
a
strong
cable
along
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
that
the
weather
be
calm
,
he
row
round
me
several
time
,
observe
my
window
and
wire
lattice
that
defend
them
.
<EOS>
that
he
discover
two
staple
upon
one
side
,
which
be
all
of
board
,
without
any
passage
for
light
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
command
his
man
to
row
up
to
that
side
,
and
fasten
a
cable
to
one
of
the
staple
,
order
them
to
tow
my
chest
,
as
they
call
it
,
toward
the
ship
.
 
<EOS>
when
it
be
there
,
he
give
direction
to
fasten
another
cable
to
the
ring
fix
in
the
cover
,
and
to
raise
up
my
chest
with
pulley
,
which
all
the
sailor
be
not
able
to
do
above
two
or
three
foot
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
they
see
my
stick
and
handkerchief
thrust
out
of
the
hole
,
and
conclude
that
some
unhappy
man
must
be
shut
up
in
the
cavity
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
ask
,
"
whether
he
or
the
crew
have
see
any
prodigious
bird
in
the
air
,
about
the
time
he
first
discover
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
to
which
he
answer
,
that
discourse
this
matter
with
the
sailor
while
I
be
asleep
,
one
of
them
say
,
he
have
observe
three
eagle
fly
towards
the
north
,
but
remark
nothing
of
their
be
large
than
the
usual
size
:
"
which
I
suppose
must
be
impute
to
the
great
height
they
be
at
;
and
he
could
not
guess
the
reason
of
my
question
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
ask
the
captain
,
"
how
far
he
reckon
we
may
be
from
land
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
by
the
good
computation
he
could
make
,
we
be
at
least
a
hundred
league
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
assure
him
,
"
that
he
must
be
mistake
by
almost
half
,
for
I
have
not
leave
the
country
<EOS>
whence
<EOS>
I
come
above
two
hour
before
I
drop
into
the
sea
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
he
begin
again
to
think
that
my
brain
be
disturb
,
of
which
he
give
me
a
hint
,
and
advise
me
to
go
to
bed
in
a
cabin
he
have
provide
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
him
,
"
I
be
well
refresh
with
his
good
entertainment
and
company
,
and
as
much
in
my
sense
as
ever
I
be
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
grow
serious
,
and
desire
to
ask
me
freely
,
"
whether
I
be
not
trouble
in
my
mind
by
the
consciousness
of
some
enormous
crime
,
for
which
I
be
punish
,
at
the
command
of
some
prince
,
by
expose
me
in
that
chest
;
as
great
criminal
,
in
other
country
,
have
be
force
to
sea
in
a
leaky
vessel
,
without
provision
:
 
for
although
he
should
be
sorry
to
have
take
so
ill
a
man
into
his
ship
,
yet
he
would
engage
his
word
to
set
me
safe
ashore
,
in
the
first
port
where
we
arrive
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
add
,
"
that
his
suspicion
be
much
increase
by
some
very
absurd
speech
I
have
deliver
at
first
to
his
sailor
,
and
afterwards
to
himself
,
in
relation
to
my
closet
or
chest
,
as
well
as
by
my
odd
look
and
behaviour
while
I
be
at
supper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
beg
his
patience
to
hear
me
tell
my
story
,
which
I
faithfully
do
,
from
the
last
time
I
leave
England
,
to
the
moment
he
first
discover
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
as
truth
always
force
its
way
into
rational
mind
,
so
this
honest
worthy
gentleman
,
who
have
some
tincture
of
learning
,
and
very
good
sense
,
be
immediately
convinced
of
my
candour
and
veracity
.
 
<EOS>
but
further
to
confirm
all
I
have
say
,
I
entreat
him
to
give
order
that
my
cabinet
should
be
bring
,
of
which
I
have
the
key
in
my
pocket
;
for
he
have
already
inform
me
how
the
seaman
dispose
of
my
closet
.
 
<EOS>
I
open
it
in
his
own
presence
,
and
show
him
the
small
collection
of
rarity
I
make
in
the
country
from
which
I
have
be
so
strangely
deliver
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
comb
I
have
contrive
out
of
the
stump
of
the
king
's
beard
,
and
another
of
the
same
material
,
but
fix
into
a
paring
of
her
majesty
's
thumb
-
nail
,
which
serve
for
the
back
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
collection
of
needle
and
pin
,
from
a
foot
to
half
a
yard
long
;
four
wasp
sting
,
like
joiner
's
tack
;
some
combing
of
the
queen
's
hair
;
a
gold
ring
,
which
one
day
she
make
me
a
present
of
,
in
a
most
obliging
manner
,
take
it
from
her
little
finger
,
and
throw
it
over
my
head
like
a
collar
.
 
<EOS>
I
desire
the
captain
would
please
to
accept
this
ring
in
return
for
his
civility
;
which
he
absolutely
refuse
.
 
<EOS>
I
show
him
a
corn
that
I
have
cut
off
with
my
own
hand
,
from
a
maid
of
honour
's
toe
;
it
be
about
the
bigness
of
kentish
pippin
,
and
grow
so
hard
,
that
when
I
return
England
,
I
get
it
hollow
into
a
cup
,
and
set
in
silver
.
 
<EOS>
lastly
,
I
desire
him
to
see
the
breech
I
have
then
on
,
which
be
make
of
a
mouse
's
skin
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
force
nothing
on
him
but
a
footman
's
tooth
,
which
I
observe
him
to
examine
with
great
curiosity
,
and
find
he
have
a
fancy
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
receive
it
with
abundance
of
thank
,
more
than
such
a
trifle
could
deserve
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
draw
by
an
unskilful
surgeon
,
in
a
mistake
,
from
one
of
Glumdalclitch
's
man
,
who
be
afflict
with
the
tooth
-
ache
,
but
it
be
as
sound
as
any
in
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
it
clean
,
and
put
it
into
my
cabinet
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
about
a
foot
long
,
and
four
inch
in
diameter
.
  
<EOS>
the
captain
be
very
well
satisfied
with
this
plain
relation
I
have
give
him
,
and
say
,
"
he
hope
,
when
we
return
to
England
,
I
would
oblige
the
world
by
put
it
on
paper
,
and
make
it
public
.
"
 
<EOS>
My
answer
be
,
"
that
we
be
overstock
with
book
of
travel
:
 
that
nothing
could
now
pass
which
be
not
extraordinary
;
wherein
I
doubt
some
author
less
consult
truth
,
than
their
own
vanity
,
or
interest
,
or
the
diversion
of
ignorant
reader
;
that
my
story
could
contain
little
beside
common
event
,
without
those
ornamental
description
of
strange
plant
,
tree
,
bird
,
and
other
animal
;
or
of
the
barbarous
custom
and
idolatry
of
savage
people
,
with
which
most
writer
abound
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
thank
him
for
his
good
opinion
,
and
promise
to
take
the
matter
into
my
thought
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
say
"
he
wonder
at
one
thing
very
much
,
which
be
,
to
hear
me
speak
so
loud
;
"
ask
me
"
whether
the
king
or
queen
of
that
country
be
thick
of
hearing
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
"
it
be
what
I
have
be
use
to
for
above
two
year
past
,
and
that
I
admire
as
much
at
the
voice
of
him
and
his
man
,
who
seem
to
me
only
to
whisper
,
and
yet
I
could
hear
them
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
when
I
speak
in
that
country
,
it
be
like
a
man
talk
in
the
street
,
to
another
look
out
from
the
top
of
a
steeple
,
unless
when
I
be
place
on
a
table
,
or
hold
in
any
person
's
hand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
"
I
have
likewise
observe
another
thing
,
that
,
when
I
first
get
into
the
ship
,
and
the
sailor
stand
all
about
me
,
I
think
they
be
the
most
little
contemptible
creature
I
have
ever
behold
.
"
 
<EOS>
for
indeed
,
while
I
be
in
that
prince
's
country
,
I
could
never
endure
to
look
in
a
glass
,
after
mine
eye
have
be
accustom
to
such
prodigious
object
,
because
the
comparison
give
me
so
despicable
a
conceit
of
myself
.
 
<EOS>
the
captain
say
,
"
that
while
we
be
at
supper
,
he
observe
me
to
look
at
every
thing
with
a
sort
of
wonder
,
and
that
I
often
seem
hardly
able
to
contain
my
laughter
,
which
he
know
not
well
how
to
take
,
but
impute
it
to
some
disorder
in
my
brain
.
<EOS>
"
I
answer
,
"
it
be
very
true
;
and
I
wonder
how
I
could
forbear
,
when
I
see
his
dish
of
the
size
of
a
silver
three
-
pence
,
a
leg
of
pork
hardly
a
mouthful
,
a
cup
not
so
big
as
a
nut
-
shell
;
"
and
so
I
go
on
,
describe
the
rest
of
his
household
-
stuff
and
provision
,
after
the
same
manner
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
although
he
queen
have
order
a
little
equipage
of
all
thing
necessary
for
me
,
while
I
be
in
her
service
,
yet
my
idea
be
wholly
take
up
with
what
I
see
on
every
side
of
me
,
and
I
wink
at
my
own
littleness
,
as
people
do
at
their
own
fault
.
 
<EOS>
the
captain
understand
my
raillery
very
well
,
and
merrily
reply
with
the
old
english
proverb
,
"
that
he
doubt
mine
eye
be
big
than
my
belly
,
for
he
do
not
observe
my
stomach
so
good
,
although
I
have
fast
all
day
;
"
and
,
continue
in
his
mirth
,
protest
"
he
would
have
gladly
give
a
hundred
pound
,
to
have
see
my
closet
in
the
eagle
's
bill
,
and
afterwards
in
its
fall
from
so
great
a
height
into
the
sea
;
which
would
certainly
have
be
a
most
astonishing
object
,
worthy
to
have
the
description
of
it
transmit
to
future
age
:
"
and
the
comparison
of
Phaeton
be
so
obvious
,
that
he
could
not
forbear
apply
it
,
although
I
do
not
much
admire
the
conceit
.
  
<EOS>
the
captain
have
be
at
Tonquin
,
be
,
in
his
return
to
England
,
drive
north
-
eastward
to
the
latitude
of
44
degree
,
and
longitude
of
143
.
 
<EOS>
but
meet
a
trade
-
wind
two
day
after
I
come
on
board
him
,
we
sail
southward
a
long
time
,
and
coast
New
Holland
,
keep
our
course
west
-
south
-
west
,
and
then
south
-
south
-
west
,
till
we
double
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
.
 
<EOS>
Our
voyage
be
very
prosperous
,
but
I
shall
not
trouble
the
reader
with
a
journal
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
captain
call
in
at
one
or
two
port
,
and
send
in
his
long
-
boat
for
provision
and
fresh
water
;
but
I
never
go
out
of
the
ship
till
we
come
into
the
Downs
,
which
be
on
the
third
day
of
June
,
1706
,
about
nine
month
after
my
escape
.
 
<EOS>
I
offer
to
leave
my
good
in
security
for
payment
of
my
freight
:
 
<EOS>
but
the
captain
protest
he
would
not
receive
one
farthing
.
 
<EOS>
We
take
a
kind
leave
of
each
other
,
and
I
make
him
promise
he
would
come
to
see
me
at
my
house
in
Redriff
.
 
<EOS>
I
hire
a
horse
and
guide
for
five
shilling
,
which
I
borrow
of
the
captain
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
be
on
the
road
,
observe
the
littleness
of
the
house
,
the
tree
,
the
cattle
,
and
the
people
,
I
begin
to
think
myself
in
Lilliput
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
of
trample
on
every
traveller
I
meet
,
and
often
call
aloud
to
have
them
stand
out
of
the
way
,
so
that
I
have
like
to
have
get
one
or
two
break
head
for
my
impertinence
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
my
own
house
,
for
which
I
be
force
to
inquire
,
one
of
the
servant
open
the
door
,
I
bend
down
to
go
in
,
(
like
a
goose
under
a
gate
,
)
for
fear
of
strike
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
My
wife
run
out
to
embrace
me
,
but
I
stoop
low
than
her
knee
,
think
she
could
otherwise
never
be
able
to
reach
my
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
My
daughter
kneel
to
ask
my
blessing
,
but
I
could
not
see
her
till
she
arise
,
have
be
so
long
use
to
stand
with
my
head
and
eye
erect
to
above
sixty
foot
;
and
then
I
go
to
take
her
up
with
one
hand
by
the
waist
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
down
upon
the
servant
,
and
one
or
two
friend
who
be
in
the
house
,
as
if
they
have
be
pigmy
and
I
a
giant
.
<EOS>
I
tell
my
wife
,
"
she
have
be
too
thrifty
,
for
I
find
she
have
starve
herself
and
her
daughter
to
nothing
.
"
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
behave
myself
so
unaccountably
,
that
they
be
all
of
the
captain
's
opinion
when
he
first
see
me
,
and
conclude
I
have
lose
my
wit
.
<EOS>
this
I
mention
as
an
instance
of
the
great
power
of
habit
and
prejudice
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
little
time
,
I
and
my
family
and
friend
come
to
a
right
understanding
:
 
but
my
wife
protest
"
I
should
never
go
to
sea
any
more
;
"
although
my
evil
destiny
so
order
,
that
she
have
not
power
to
hinder
me
,
as
the
reader
may
know
hereafter
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
I
here
conclude
the
second
part
of
my
unfortunate
voyage
.
    
<EOS>
PART
III
:
<EOS>
a
voyage
to
LAPUTA
,
BALNIBARBI
,
LUGGNAGG
,
glubbdubdrib
,
and
JAPAN
.
 
<EOS>
the
author
set
out
on
his
third
voyage
.
 
<EOS>
be
take

pirate

<EOS>
the
malice
of
a

.
 
<EOS>
His
arrival
at
an
island
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
receive
into
Laputa
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
be
at
home
above
ten
day
,
when
Captain
William
Robinson
,
a
cornish
man
,
commander
of
the
Hopewell
,
a
stout
ship
of
three
hundred
ton
,
come
to
my
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
formerly
be
surgeon
of
another
ship
where
he
be
master
,
and
a
fourth
part
owner
,
in
a
voyage
to
the
Levant
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
always
treat
me
more
like
a
brother
,
than
an
inferior
officer
;
and
,
hearing
of
my
arrival
,
make
me
a
visit
,
as
I
apprehend
only
out
of
friendship
,
for
nothing
pass
more
than
what
be
usual
after
long
absence
.
 
<EOS>
but
repeat
his
visit
often
,
express
his
joy
to
find
I
me
in
good
health
,
ask
,
"
whether
I
be
now
settle
for
life
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
add
,
"
that
he
intend
a
voyage
to
the
East
Indies
in
two
month
,
"
at
last
he
plainly
invite
me
,
though
with
some
apology
,
to
be
surgeon
of
the
ship
;
"
that
I
should
have
another
surgeon
under
me
,
beside
our
two
mate
;
that
my
salary
should
be
double
to
the
usual
pay
;
and
that
have
experience
my
knowledge
in
sea
-
affair
to
be
at
least
equal
to
his
,
he
would
enter
into
any
engagement
to
follow
my
advice
,
as
much
as
if
I
have
share
in
the
command
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
say
so
many
other
oblige
thing
,
and
I
know
him
to
be
so
honest
a
man
<EOS>
,
that
I
could
not
reject
this
proposal
;
the
thirst
I
have
of
see
the
world
,
notwithstanding
my
past
misfortune
,
continue
as
violent
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
difficulty
that
remain
,
be
to
persuade
my
wife
,
whose
consent
however
I
at
last
obtain
,
by
the
prospect
of
advantage
she
propose
to
her
child
.
  
<EOS>
We
set
out
the
5th
day
of
August
,
1706
,
and
arrive
at
Fort
St.
George
the
11th
of
April
,
1707
.
 
<EOS>
We
staid
there
three
week
to
refresh
our
crew
,
many
of
whom
be
sick
.
 
<EOS>
from
thence
we
go
to
Tonquin
,
where
the
captain
resolve
to
continue
some
time
,
because
many
of
the
good
he
intend
to
buy
be
not
ready
,
nor
could
he
expect
to
be
dispatch
in
several
month
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
in
hope
to
defray
some
of
the
charge
he
must
be
at
,
he
buy
a
sloop
,
load
it
with
several
sort
of
good
,
wherewith
the
Tonquinese
usually
trade
to
the
neighbour
island
,
and
put
fourteen
man
on
board
,
whereof
three
be
of
the
country
,
he
appoint
me
master
of
the
sloop
,
and
give
me
power
to
traffic
,
while
he
transact
his
affair
at
Tonquin
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
not
sail
above
three
day
,
when
a
great
storm
arise
,
we
be
drive
five
day
to
the
north
-
north
-
east
,
and
then
to
the
east
:
 
after
which
we
have
fair
weather
,
but
still
with
a
pretty
strong
gale
from
the
west
.
 
<EOS>
upon
the
tenth
day
we
be
chase
by
two
pirate
,
who
soon
overtake
us
;
for
my
sloop
be
so
deep
laden
<EOS>
,
that
she
sail
very
slow
,
neither
be
we
in
a
condition
to
defend
ourselves
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
board
about
the
same
time
by
both
the
pirate
,
who
enter
furiously
at
the
head
of
their
man
;
but
find
us
all
prostrate
upon
our
face
(
for
so
I
give
order
)
,
they
pinion
us
with
strong
rope
,
and
set
guard
upon
us
,
go
to
search
the
sloop
.
  
<EOS>
I
observe
among
them
a
Dutchman
,
who
seem
to
be
of
some
authority
,
though
he
be
not
commander
of
either
ship
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
us
by
our
countenance
to
be
Englishmen
,
and
jabber
to
us
in
his
own
language
,
swore
we
should
be
tie
back
to
back
and
throw
into
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
I
speak
Dutch
tolerably
well
;
I
tell
him
who
we
be
,
and
beg
him
,
in
consideration
of
our
be
Christians
and
Protestants
,
of
neighbouring
country
in
strict
alliance
,
that
he
would
move
the
captain
to
take
some
pity
on
us
.
 
<EOS>
this
inflame
his
rage
;
he
repeat
his
threatening
,
and
turn
to
his
companion
,
speak
with
great
vehemence
in
the
japanese
language
,
as
I
suppose
,
often
use
the
word
Christianos
.
  
<EOS>
the
large
of
the
two
pirate
ship
be
command
by
a
japanese
captain
,
who
speak
a
little
Dutch
,
but
very
imperfectly
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
up
to
me
,
and
after
several
question
,
which
I
answer
in
great
humility
,
he
say
,
"
we
should
not
die
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
make
the
captain
a
very
low
bow
,
and
then
,
turn
to
the
Dutchman
,
say
,
"
I
be
sorry
to
find
more
mercy
in
a
heathen
,
than
in
a
brother
christian
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
soon
reason
to
repent
those
foolish
word
:
 
for
that
malicious
reprobate
,
have
often
endeavour
in
vain
to
persuade
both
the
captain
that
I
may
be
throw
into
the
sea
(
which
they
would
not
yield
to
,
after
the
promise
make
me
that
I
should
not
die
)
<EOS>
,
however
,
prevail
so
far
,
as
to
have
a
punishment
inflict
on
me
,
bad
,
in
all
human
appearance
,
than
death
itself
.
 
<EOS>
My
man
be
send
by
an
equal
division
into
both
the
pirate
ship
,
and
my
sloop
new
man
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
myself
,
it
be
determine
that
I
should
be
set
adrift
in
a
small
canoe
,
with
paddle
and
a
sail
,
and
four
day
'
provision
;
which
last
,
the
japanese
captain
be
so
kind
to
double
out
of
his
own
store
,
and
would
permit
no
man
to
search
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
down
into
the
canoe
,
while
the
Dutchman
,
stand
upon
the
deck
,
load
me
with
all
the
curse
and
injurious
term
his
language
could
afford
.
  
<EOS>
about
an
hour
before
we
see
the
pirate
I
have
take
an
observation
,
and
find
we
be
in
the
latitude
of
46
n.
and
longitude
of
183
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
at
some
distance
from
the
pirate
,
I
discover
,
by
my
pocket
-
glass
,
several
island
to
the
south
-
east
.
 
<EOS>
I
set
up
my
sail
,
<EOS>
the
wind
be
fair
,
with
a
design
to
reach
the
near
of
those
island
,
which
I
make
a
shift
to
do
,
in
about
three
hour
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
all
rocky
:
 
<EOS>
however
I
get
many
bird
'
egg
;
and
,
strike
fire
,
I
kindle
some
heath
and
dry
sea
-
weed
,
by
which
I
roast
my
egg
.
 
<EOS>
I
eat
no
other
supper
,
be
resolve
to
spare
my
provision
as
much
as
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
I
pass
the
night
under
the
shelter
of
a
rock
,
strew
some
heath
under
me
,
and
sleep
pretty
well
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
I
sail
to
another
island
,
and
thence
to
a
third
and
fourth
,
sometimes
use
my
sail
,
and
sometimes
my
paddle
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
not
to
trouble
the
reader
with
a
particular
account
of
my
distress
,
let
it
suffice
,
that
on
the
fifth
day
I
arrive
at
the
last
island
in
my
sight
,
which
lie
south
-
south
-
east
to
the
former
.
  
<EOS>
this
island
be
at
a
great
distance
than
I
expect
,
and
I
do
not
reach
it
in
less
than
five
hour
.
 
<EOS>
I
encompass
it
almost
round
,
before
I
could
find
a
convenient
place
to
land
in
;
which
be
a
small
creek
,
about
three
time
the
wideness
of
my
canoe
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
the
island
to
be
all
rocky
,
only
a
little
intermingled
with
tuft
of
grass
,
and
sweet
-
smell
herb
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
out
my
small
provision
and
after
have
refresh
myself
,
I
secure
the
remainder
in
a
cave
,
whereof
there
be
great
number
;
I
gather
plenty
of
egg
upon
the
rock
,
and
get
a
quantity
of
dry
sea
-
weed
,
and
parched
grass
,
which
I
design
to
kindle
the
next
day
,
and
roast
my
egg
as
well
as
I
could
,
for
I
have
about
me
my
flint
,
steel
,
match
,
and
burning
-
glass
.
 
<EOS>
I
lie
all
night
in
the
cave
where
I
have
lodge
my
provision
.
 
<EOS>
My
bed
be
the
same
dry
grass
and
sea
-
weed
which
I
intend
for
fuel
.
 
<EOS>
I
sleep
very
little
,
for
the
disquiet
of
my
mind
prevail
over
my
weariness
,
and
keep
me
awake
.
 
<EOS>
I
consider
how
impossible
it
be
to
preserve
my
life
in
<EOS>
so
desolate
a
place
,
and
<EOS>
how
miserable
my
end
must
be
:
 
yet
find
myself
so
listless
and
desponding
,
that
I
have
not
the
heart
to
rise
;
and
before
I
could
get
spirit
enough
to
creep
out
of
my
cave
,
the
day
be
far
advanced
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
awhile
among
the
rock
:
 
<EOS>
the
sky
be
perfectly
clear
,
and
the
sun
so
hot
,
that
I
be
force
to
turn
my
face
from
it
:
 
when
all
on
a
sudden
<EOS>
it
become
obscure
,
as
I
think
,
in
a
manner
very
different
from
what
happen
by
the
interposition
of
a
cloud
.
 
<EOS>
I
turn
back
,
and
perceive
a
vast
opaque
body
between
me
and
the
sun
move
forwards
towards
the
island
:
 
<EOS>
it
seem
to
be
about
two
mile
high
,
and
hide
the
sun
six
or
seven
minute
;
but
I
do
not
observe
the
air
to
be
much
cold
,
or
the
sky
more
darkened
,
than
if
I
have
stand
under
the
shade
of
a
mountain
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
approach
nearer
over
the
place
where
I
be
,
it
appear
to
be
a
firm
substance
,
the
bottom
flat
,
smooth
,
and
shine
very
bright
,
from
the
reflection
of
the
sea
below
.
 
<EOS>
I
stand
upon
a
height
about
two
hundred
yard
from
the
shore
,
and
see
this
vast
body
descend
almost
to
a
parallel
with
me
,
at
less
than
an
english
mile
distance
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
out
my
pocket
perspective
,
and
could
plainly
discover
number
of
people
move
up
and
down
the
side
of
it
,
which
appear
to
be
slope
;
but
what
those
people
where
do
I
be
not
able
to
distinguish
.
  
<EOS>
the
natural
love
of
life
give
me
some
inward
motion
of
joy
,
and
I
be
ready
to
entertain
a
hope
that
this
adventure
may
,
some
way
or
other
,
help
to
deliver
me
from
the
desolate
place
and
condition
I
be
in
.
 
<EOS>
but
at
the
same
time
the
reader
can
hardly
conceive
my
astonishment
,
to
behold
an
island
in
the
air
,
inhabit
by
man
,
who
be
able
(
as
it
should
seem
)
to
raise
or
sink
,
or
put
it
into
progressive
motion
,
as
they
please
.
 
<EOS>
but
not
be
at
that
time
in
a
disposition
to
philosophise
upon
this
phenomenon
,
I
rather
choose
to
observe
what
course
the
island
would
take
,
because
it
seem
for
awhile
to
stand
still
.
 
<EOS>
yet
soon
after
,
it
advance
nearer
,
and
I
could
see
the
side
of
it
encompass
with
several
gradation
of
gallery
,
and
stair
,
at
certain
interval
,
to
descend
from
one
to
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
low
gallery
,
I
beheld
some
people
fish
with
long
angle
rod
,
and
other
look
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
wave
my
cap
(
for
my
hat
be
long
since
wear
out
)
and
my
handkerchief
toward
the
island
;
and
upon
its
near
approach
,
I
call
and
shout
with
the
utmost
strength
of
my
voice
;
and
then
look
circumspectly
,
I
beheld
a
crowd
gather
to
that
side
which
be
most
in
my
view
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
by
their
pointing
towards
me
and
to
each
other
,
that
they
plainly
discover
me
,
although
they
make
no
return
to
my
shouting
.
<EOS>
but
I
could
see
four
or
five
man
run
in
great
haste
,
up
the
stair
,
to
the
top
of
the
island
,
who
then
disappear
.
 
<EOS>
I
happen
rightly
to
conjecture
,
that
these
be
send
for
order
to
some
person
in
authority
upon
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
the
number
of
people
increase
,
and
,
in
less
than
half
all
hour
,
the
island
be
move
and
raise
in
such
a
manner
,
that
the
low
gallery
appear
in
a
parallel
of
less
then
a
hundred
yard
distance
from
the
height
where
I
stand
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
put
myself
in
the
most
supplicating
posture
,
and
speak
in
the
humble
accent
,
but
receive
no
answer
.
 
<EOS>
those
who
stand
nearest
over
against
me
,
seem
to
be
person
of
distinction
,
as
I
suppose
by
their
habit
.
<EOS>
They
confer
earnestly
with
each
other
,
look
often
upon
me
.
<EOS>
at
length
one
of
them
call
out
in
a
clear
,
polite
,
smooth
dialect
,
not
unlike
in
sound
to
the
Italian
:
 
and
therefore
I
return
an
answer
in
that
language
,
hope
at
least
that
the
cadence
may
be
more
agreeable
to
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
although
neither
of
us
understand
the
other
,
yet
my
meaning
be
easily
know
,
for
the
people
see
the
distress
I
be
in
.
  
<EOS>
They
make
sign
for
me
to
come
down
from
the
rock
,
and
go
towards
the
shore
,
which
I
accordingly
do
;
and
the
fly
island
be
raise
to
a
convenient
height
,
the
verge
directly
over
me
,
a
chain
be
let
down
from
the
low
gallery
,
with
a
seat
fasten
to
the
bottom
,
to
which
I
fix
myself
,
and
be
draw
up
by
pulley
.
   
<EOS>
the
humour
and
disposition
of
the
Laputians
describe
.
 
<EOS>
an
account
of
their
learning
.
 
<EOS>
of
the
king
and
his
court
.
 
<EOS>
the
author
's
reception
there
.
 
<EOS>
the
inhabitant
subject
to
fear
and
disquietude
.
 
<EOS>
an
account
of
the
woman
.
 
<EOS>
at
my
alighting
,
I
be
surround
with
a
crowd
of
people
,
but
those
who
stand
nearest
seem
to
be
of
well
quality
.
 
<EOS>
They
beheld
me
with
all
the
mark
and
circumstance
of
wonder
;
neither
indeed
be
I
much
in
their
debt
,
have
never
till
then
see
a
race
of
mortal
so
singular
in
their
shape
,
habit
,
and
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
Their
head
be
all
recline
,
either
to
the
right
,
or
the
left
;
one
of
their
eye
turn
inward
,
and
the
other
directly
up
to
the
zenith
.
 
<EOS>
Their
outward
garment
be
adorn
with
the
figure
of
sun
,
moon
,
and
star
;
interweave
with
those
of
fiddle
,
flute
,
harp
,
trumpet
,
guitar
,
harpsichord
,
and
many
other
instrument
of
music
,
unknown
to
us
in
Europe
.
 
<EOS>
I
observe
,
here
and
there
,
many
in
the
habit
of
servant
,
with
a
blow
bladder
,
fasten
like
a
flail
to
the
end
of
a
stick
,
which
they
carry
in
their
hand
.
 
<EOS>
in
each
bladder
be
a
small
quantity
of
dry
pea
,
or
little
pebble
,
as
I
be
afterwards
inform
.
 
<EOS>
with
these
bladder
,
they
now
and
then
flap
the
mouth
and
ear
of
those
who
stand
near
them
,
of
which
practice
I
could
not
then
conceive
the
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
the
mind
of
these
people
be
so
take
up
with
intense
speculation
,
that
they
neither
can
speak
,
nor
attend
to
the
discourse
of
other
,
without
be
rouse
by
some
external
taction
upon
the
organ
of
speech
and
hearing
;
for
which
reason
,
those
person
who
be
able
to
afford
it
always
keep
a
flapper
(
the
original
be
climenole
)
in
their
family
,
as
one
of
their
domestic
;
nor
ever
walk
abroad
,
or
make
visit
,
without
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
business
of
this
officer
be
,
when
two
,
three
,
or
more
person
be
in
company
,
gently
to
strike
with
his
bladder
the
mouth
of
him
who
be
to
speak
,
and
the
right
ear
of
him
or
them
to
whom
the
speaker
address
himself
.
 
<EOS>
this
flapper
be
likewise
employ
diligently
to
attend
his
master
in
his
walk
,
and
upon
occasion
to
give
him
a
soft
flap
on
his
eye
;
because
he
be
always
so
wrap
up
in
cogitation
,
that
he
be
in
manifest
danger
of
fall
down
every
precipice
,
and
bounce
his
head
against
every
post
;
and
in
the
street
,
of
justle
other
,
or
be
justle
himself
into
the
kennel
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
to
give
the
reader
this
information
,
without
which
he
would
be
at
the
same
loss
with
me
to
understand
the
proceeding
of
these
people
,
as
they
conduct
me
up
the
stair
to
the
top
of
the
island
,
and
from
thence
to
the
royal
palace
.
 
<EOS>
while
we
be
ascend
,
they
forget
several
time
what
they
be
about
,
and
leave
me
to
myself
,
till
their
memory
be
again
rouse
by
their
flapper
;
for
they
appear
altogether
unmoved
by
the
sight
of
my
foreign
habit
and
countenance
,
and
by
the
shout
of
the
vulgar
,
whose
thought
and
mind
be
more
disengaged
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
we
enter
the
palace
,
and
proceed
into
the
chamber
of
presence
,
where
I
see
the
king
seat
on
his
throne
,
attend
on
each
side
by
person
of
prime
quality
.
 
<EOS>
before
the
throne
,
be
a
large
table
fill
with
globe
and
sphere
,
and
mathematical
instrument
of
all
kind
.
 
<EOS>
His
majesty
take
not
the
least
notice
of
us
,
although
our
entrance
be
not
without
sufficient
noise
,
by
the
concourse
of
all
person
belong
to
the
court
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
then
deep
in
a
problem
;
and
we
attend
at
least
an
hour
,
before
he
could
solve
it
.
 
<EOS>
there
stand
by
him
,
on
each
side
,
a
young
page
with
flap
in
their
hand
,
and
when
they
see
he
be
at
leisure
,
one
of
them
gently
strike
his
mouth
,
and
the
other
his
right
ear
;
at
which
he
startle
like
one
awake
on
the
sudden
,
and
look
towards
me
and
the
company
I
be
in
,
recollect
the
occasion
of
our
come
,
<EOS>
whereof
he
have
be
inform
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
speak
some
word
,
whereupon
immediately
<EOS>
a
young
man
with
a
flap
come
up
to
my
side
,
and
flap
me
gently
on
the
right
ear
;
but
I
make
sign
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
that
I
have
no
occasion
for
such
an
instrument
;
which
,
as
I
afterwards
find
,
give
his
majesty
,
and
the
whole
court
,
a
very
mean
opinion
of
my
understanding
.
 
<EOS>
the
king
,
as
far
as
I
could
conjecture
,
ask
me
several
question
,
and
I
address
myself
to
him
in
all
the
language
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
when
it
be
find
I
could
neither
understand
nor
be
understand
,
I
be
conduct
by
his
order
to
an
apartment
in
his
palace
(
this
prince
be
distinguish
above
all
his
predecessor
for
his
hospitality
to
stranger
)
,
where
two
servant
be
appoint
to
attend
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
dinner
be
bring
,
and
four
person
of
quality
,
whom
I
remember
to
have
see
very
near
the
king
's
person
,
do
me
the
honour
to
dine
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
two
course
,
of
three
dish
each
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
first
course
,
there
be
a
shoulder
of
mutton
cut
into
an
equilateral
triangle
,
a
piece
of
beef
into
a
rhomboide
,
and
a
pudding
into
a
cycloid
.
 
<EOS>
the
second
course
be
two
duck
truss
up
in
the
form
of
fiddle
;
sausage
and
pudding
resemble
flute
and
hautboy
,
and
a
breast
of
veal
in
the
shape
of
a
harp
.
 
<EOS>
the
servant
cut
our
bread
into
cone
,
cylinder
,
parallelogram
,
and
several
other
mathematical
figure
.
  
<EOS>
while
we
be
at
dinner
,
I
make
bold
to
ask
the
name
of
several
thing
in
their
language
,
and
those
noble
person
,
by
the
assistance
of
their
flapper
,
delighted
to
give
me
answer
,
hope
to
raise
my
admiration
of
their
great
ability
if
I
could
be
bring
to
converse
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
soon
able
to
call
for
bread
and
drink
,
or
whatever
else
I
want
.
  
<EOS>
after
dinner
my
company
withdraw
,
and
a
person
be
send
to
me
by
the
king
's
order
,
attend
by
a
flapper
.
 
<EOS>
He
bring
with
him
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
and
three
or
four
book
,
give
me
to
understand
by
sign
,
that
he
be
send
to
teach
me
the
language
.
 
<EOS>
We
sit
together
four
hour
,
in
which
time
I
write
down
a
great
number
of
word
in
column
,
with
the
translation
over
against
them
;
I
likewise
make
a
shift
to
learn
several
short
sentence
;
for
my
tutor
would
order
one
of
my
servant
to
fetch
something
,
to
turn
about
,
to
make
a
bow
,
to
sit
,
or
to
stand
,
or
walk
,
and
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
take
down
the
sentence
in
writing
.
 
<EOS>
He
show
me
also
,
in
one
of
his
book
,
the
figure
of
the
sun
,
moon
,
and
star
,
the
zodiac
,
the
tropic
,
and
polar
circle
,
together
with
the
denomination
of
many
plain
and
solid
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
me
the
name
and
description
of
all
the
musical
instrument
,
and
the
general
term
of
art
in
play
on
each
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
after
he
have
leave
me
,
I
place
all
my
word
,
with
their
interpretation
,
in
alphabetical
order
.
 
<EOS>
and
thus
,
in
a
few
day
,
by
the
help
of
a
very
faithful
memory
,
I
get
some
insight
into
their
language
.
 
<EOS>
the
word
,
which
I
interpret
the
fly
or
float
island
,
be
in
the
original
Laputa
,
whereof
I
could
never
learn
the
true
etymology
.
 
<EOS>
Lap
,
in
the
old
obsolete
language
,
signify
high
;
and
untuh
,
a
governor
;
from
which
they
say
,
by
corruption
,
be
derive
Laputa
,
from
Lapuntuh
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
approve
of
this
derivation
,
which
seem
to
be
a
little
strained
.
 
<EOS>
I
venture
to
offer
to
the
learn
among
them
a
conjecture
of
my
own
,
that
Laputa
be
quasi
lap
out
;
lap
,
signify
properly
,
the
dancing
of
the
sunbeam
in
the
sea
,
and
out
,
a
wing
;
which
,
however
,
I
shall
not
obtrude
,
but
submit
to
the
judicious
reader
.
  
<EOS>
those
to
whom
the
king
have
entrust
me
,
observe
how
ill
I
be
clothe
,
order
a
tailor
to
come
next
morning
,
and
take
measure
for
a
suit
of
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
this
operator
do
his
office
after
a
different
manner
from
those
of
his
trade
in
Europe
.
 
<EOS>
He
first
take
my
altitude
by
a
quadrant
,
and
then
,
with
a
rule
and
compass
,
describe
the
dimension
and
outline
of
my
whole
body
,
all
which
he
enter
upon
paper
;
and
in
six
day
bring
my
clothe
very
ill
make
,
and
quite
out
of
shape
,
by
happen
to
mistake
a
figure
in
the
calculation
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
comfort
be
,
that
I
observe
such
accident
very
frequent
,
and
little
regarded
.
  
<EOS>
during
my
confinement
for
want
of
clothe
,
and
by
an
indisposition
that
hold
me
some
day
longer
,
I
much
enlarge
my
dictionary
;
and
when
I
go
next
to
court
,
be
able
to
understand
many
thing
the
king
speak
,
and
to
return
him
some
kind
of
answer
.
 
<EOS>
His
majesty
have
give
order
,
that
the
island
should
move
north
-
east
and
by
east
,
to
the
vertical
point
over
Lagado
,
the
metropolis
of
the
whole
kingdom
below
,
upon
the
firm
earth
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
about
ninety
league
distant
,
and
our
voyage
last
four
day
and
a
half
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
in
the
least
sensible
of
the
progressive
motion
make
in
the
air
by
the
island
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
second
morning
,
about
eleven
o'clock
,
the
king
himself
in
person
,
attend
by
his
nobility
,
courtier
,
and
officer
,
have
prepare
all
their
musical
instrument
,
play
on
them
for
three
hour
without
intermission
,
so
that
I
be
quite
stunned
with
the
noise
;
neither
could
I
possibly
guess
the
meaning
,
till
my
tutor
inform
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
that
,
the
people
of
their
island
have
their
ear
adapt
to
hear
"
the
music
of
the
sphere
,
which
always
play
at
certain
period
,
and
the
court
be
now
prepared
to
bear
their
part
,
in
whatever
instrument
they
most
excel
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
our
journey
towards
Lagado
,
the
capital
city
,
his
majesty
order
that
the
island
should
stop
over
certain
town
and
village
,
from
whence
he
may
receive
the
petition
of
his
subject
.
 
<EOS>
and
to
this
purpose
,
several
packthread
be
let
down
,
with
small
weight
at
the
bottom
.
 
<EOS>
on
these
packthread
the
people
string
their
petition
,
which
mount
up
directly
,
like
the
scrap
of
paper
fasten
by
school
boy
at
the
end
of
the
string
that
hold
their
kite
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
we
receive
wine
and
victual
from
below
,
which
be
draw
up
by
pulley
.
  
<EOS>
the
knowledge
I
have
in
mathematic
,
give
me
great
assistance
in
acquire
their
phraseology
,
which
depend
much
upon
that
science
,
and
music
;
and
in
the
latter
I
be
not
unskilled
.
 
<EOS>
Their
idea
be
perpetually
conversant
in
line
and
figure
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
would
,
for
example
,
praise
the
beauty
of
a
woman
,
or
any
other
animal
,
they
describe
it
by
rhomb
,
circle
,
parallelogram
,
ellipsis
,
and
other
geometrical
term
,
or
by
word
of
art
draw
from
music
,
needless
here
to
repeat
.
 
<EOS>
I
observe
in
the
king
's
kitchen
all
sort
of
mathematical
and
musical
instrument
,
after
the
figure
of
which
they
cut
up
the
joint
that
be
serve
to
his
majesty
's
table
.
  
<EOS>
Their
house
be
very
ill
build
,
the
wall
bevil
,
without
one
right
angle
in
any
apartment
;
and
this
defect
arise
from
the
contempt
they
bear
to
practical
geometry
,
which
they
despise
as
vulgar
and
mechanic
;
those
instruction
they
give
be
too
refined
for
the
intellect
of
their
workman
,
which
occasion
perpetual
mistake
.
<EOS>
and
although
they
be
dexterous
enough
upon
a
piece
of
paper
,
in
the
management
of
the
rule
,
the
pencil
,
and
the
divider
,
yet
in
the
common
action
and
behaviour
of
life
,
I
have
not
see
a
more
clumsy
,
awkward
,
and
unhandy
people
,
nor
so
slow
and
perplex
in
their
conception
upon
all
other
subject
,
except
those
of
mathematic
and
music
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
very
bad
reasoner
,
and
vehemently
give
to
opposition
,
unless
when
they
happen
to
be
of
the
right
opinion
,
which
be
seldom
their
case
.
 
<EOS>
imagination
,
fancy
,
and
invention
<EOS>
,
they
be
wholly
stranger
to
,
nor
have
any
word
in
their
language
,
by
which
those
idea
can
be
express
;
the
whole
compass
of
their
thought
and
mind
be
shut
up
within
the
two
forementione
science
.
  
<EOS>
Most
of
them
,
and
especially
those
who
deal
in
the
astronomical
part
,
have
great
faith
in
judicial
astrology
,
although
they
be
ashamed
to
own
it
publicly
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
I
chiefly
admire
,
and
think
altogether
unaccountable
,
be
the
strong
disposition
I
observe
in
them
towards
news
and
politic
,
perpetually
inquire
into
public
affair
,
give
their
judgment
in
matter
of
state
,
and
passionately
dispute
every
inch
of
a
party
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
indeed
observe
the
same
disposition
among
most
of
the
mathematician
I
have
know
in
Europe
,
although
I
could
never
discover
the
least
analogy
between
the
two
science
;
unless
those
people
suppose
,
that
because
the
small
circle
have
as
many
degree
as
the
large
,
therefore
the
regulation
and
management
of
the
world
require
no
more
ability
than
the
handling
and
turning
of
a
globe
;
but
I
rather
take
this
quality
to
spring
from
a
very
common
infirmity
of
human
nature
,
incline
us
to
be
most
curious
and
conceited
in
matter
where
we
have
least
concern
,
and
for
which
we
be
least
adapt
by
study
or
nature
.
  
<EOS>
these
people
be
under
continual
disquietude
,
never
enjoy
a
minute
peace
of
mind
;
and
their
disturbance
proceed
from
cause
which
very
little
affect
the
rest
of
mortal
.
 
<EOS>
Their
apprehension
arise
from
several
change
they
dread
in
the
celestial
body
:
 
for
instance
,
that
the
earth
,
by
the
continual
approach
of
the
sun
towards
it
,
must
,
in
course
of
time
,
be
absorb
,
or
swallow
up
;
that
the
face
of
the
sun
,
will
,
by
degree
,
be
encrust
with
its
own
effluvia
,
and
give
no
more
light
to
the
world
;
that
the
earth
very
narrowly
escape
a
brush
from
the
tail
of
the
last
comet
,
which
would
have
infallibly
reduce
it
to
ashe
;
and
that
the
next
,
which
they
have
calculate
for
one
-
and
-
thirty
year
hence
,
will
probably
destroy
us
.
 
<EOS>
for
if
,
in
its
perihelion
,
it
should
approach
within
a
certain
degree
of
the
sun
(
as
by
their
calculation
they
have
reason
to
dread
)
it
will
receive
a
degree
of
heat
ten
thousand
time
more
intense
than
that
of
red
hot
glowing
iron
,
and
in
its
absence
from
the
sun
,
carry
a
blaze
tail
ten
hundred
thousand
and
fourteen
mile
long
,
through
which
,
if
the
earth
should
pass
at
the
distance
of
one
hundred
thousand
mile
from
the
nucleus
,
or
main
body
of
the
comet
,
it
must
in
its
passage
be
set
on
fire
,
and
reduce
to
ashe
:
 
that
the
sun
,
daily
spend
its
ray
without
any
nutriment
to
supply

attend
with
the
destruction
of
this
earth
,
and
of
all
the
planet
that
receive
their
light
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
so
perpetually
alarm
with
the
apprehension
of
these
,
and
the
like
impending
danger
,
that
they
can
neither
sleep
quietly
in
their
bed
,
nor
have
any
relish
for
the
common
pleasure
and
amusement
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
meet
an
acquaintance
in
the
morning
,
the
first
question
be
about
the
sun
's
health
,
how
he
look
at
his
setting
and
rise
,
and
what
hope
they
have
to
avoid
the
stroke
of
the
approach
comet
.
 
<EOS>
this
conversation
<EOS>
they
be
apt
to
run
into
with
the
same
temper
that
boy
discover
in
delight
to
hear
terrible
story
of
spirit
and
hobgoblin
,
which
they
greedily
listen
to
,
and
dare
not
go
to
bed
for
fear
.
  
<EOS>
the
woman
of
the
island
have
abundance
of
vivacity
:
 
<EOS>
they
,
contemn
their
husband
,
and
be
exceedingly
fond
of
stranger
,
whereof
there
be
always
a
considerable
number
from
the
continent
below
,
attend
at
court
,
either
upon
affair
of
the
several
town
and
corporation
,
or
their
own
particular
occasion
,
but
be
much
despised
,
because
they
want
the
same
endowment
.
 
<EOS>
among
these
the
lady
choose
their
gallant
:
 
but
the
vexation
be
,
that
they
act
with
too
much
ease
and
security
;
for
the
husband
be
always
so
rapt
in
speculation
,
that
the
mistress
and
lover
may
proceed
to
the
great
familiarity
before
his
face
,
if
he
be
but
provide
with
paper
and
implement
,
and
without
his
flapper
at
his
side
.
  
<EOS>
the
wife
and
daughter
lament
their
confinement
to
the
island
,
although
I
think
it
the
most
delicious
spot
of
ground
in
the
world
;
and
although
they
live
here
in
the
great
plenty
and
magnificence
,
and
be
allow
to
do
whatever
they
please
,
they
long
to
see
the
world
,
and
take
the
diversion
of
the
metropolis
,
which
they
be
not
allow
to
do
without
a
particular
license
from
the
king
;
and
this
be
not
easy
to
be
obtain
,
because
the
people
of
quality
have
find
,
by
frequent
experience
,
how
hard
it
be
to
persuade
their
woman
to
return
from
below
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
tell
that
a
great
court
lady
,
who
have
several
child
,
 
be
married
to
the
prime
minister
,
the
rich
subject
in
the
kingdom
,
a
very
graceful
person
,
extremely
fond
of
her
,
and
live
in
the
fine
palace
of
the
island
,
 
go
down
to
Lagado
on
the
pretence
of
health
,
there
hide
herself
for
several
month
,
till
the
king
send
a
warrant
to
search
for
her
;
and
she
be
find
in
an
obscure
eating
-
house
all
in
rag
,
have
pawn
her
clothe
to
maintain
an
old
deform
footman
,
who
beat
her
every
day
,
and
in
whose
company
she
be
take
,
much
against
her
will
.
 
<EOS>
and
although
her
husband
receive
her
with
all
possible
kindness
,
and
without
the
least
reproach
,
she
soon
after
contrive
to
steal
down
again
,
with
all
her
jewel
,
to
the
same
gallant
,
and
have
not
be
hear
of
since
.
  
<EOS>
this
may
perhaps
pass
with
the
reader
rather
for
an
european
or
english
story
,
than
for
one
of
a
country
so
remote
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
may
please
to
consider
,
that
the
caprice
of
womankind
be
not
limit
by
any
climate
or
nation

and
that
they
be
much
more
uniform

than
can

easily
imagine
.
  
<EOS>
in
about
a
month
's

I
have
make
a
tolerable
proficiency
in
their

,
and
be
able
to
answer
most
of
the
king
's
question
,
when
I
have
the
honour
to
attend
him

<EOS>
His

discover
not

to
inquire
into
the
law
,
government
,
history
,
religion
,
or
manner
of
the
country
where
I
have
be
;
but
confine
his
question
to
the
state
of
mathematic
,
and
receive
the
account
I
give
him
with
great
contempt
and
indifference
,
though
often
rouse
by
his
flapper
on
each

<EOS>

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
I
desire
leave
of
this
prince
to
see
the
curiosity
of
the
island
,
which
he
be
graciously
pleased
to
grant
,
and
order
my
tutor
to
attend
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
chiefly
want
to
know
,
to
what
cause
,
in
art
or
in
nature
,
it
owe
its
several
motion
,
whereof
I
will
now
give
a
philosophical
account
to
the
reader
.
  
<EOS>
the
fly
or
float
island
be
exactly
circular
,
its
diameter
7837
yard
,
or
about
four
mile
and
a
half
,
and
consequently
contain
ten
thousand
acre
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
three
hundred
yard
thick
.
 
<EOS>
the
bottom
,
or
under
surface
,
which
appear
to
those
who
view
it
below
,
be
one
even
regular
plate
of
adamant
,
shoot
up
to
the
height
of
about
two
hundred
yard
.
 
<EOS>
above
it
lie
the
several
mineral
in
their
usual
order
,
and
over
all
be
a
coat
of
rich
mould
,
ten
or
twelve
foot
deep
.
 
<EOS>
the
declivity
of
the
upper
surface
,
from
the
circumference
to
the
centre
,
be
the
natural
cause
why
all
the
dew
and
rain
,
which
fall
upon
the
island
,
be
convey
in
small
rivulet
toward
the
middle
,
where
they
be
empty
into
four
large
basin
,
each
of
about
half
a
mile
in
circuit
,
and
two
hundred
yard
distant
from
the
centre
.
 
<EOS>
from
these
basin
the
water
be
continually
exhale
by
the
sun
in
the
daytime
,
which
effectually
prevent
their
overflowing
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
as
it
be
in
the
power
of
the
monarch
to
raise
the
island
above
the
region
of
cloud
and
vapour
,
he
can
prevent
the
falling
of
dew
and
rain
whenever
he
please
.
<EOS>
for
the
high
cloud
can
not
rise
above
two
mile
,
as
naturalist
agree
,
at
least
they
be
never
know
to
do
so
in
that
country
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
centre
of
the
island
there
be
a
chasm
about
fifty
yard
in
diameter
,
whence
the
astronomer
descend
into
a
large
dome
,
which
be
therefore
call
flandona
gagnole
,
or
the
astronomer
's
cave
,
situate
at
the
depth
of
a
hundred
yard
beneath
the
upper
surface
of
the
adamant
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
cave
be
twenty
lamp
continually
burn
,
which
,
from
the
reflection
of
the
adamant
,
cast
a
strong
light
into
every
part
.
 
<EOS>
the
place
be
store
with
great
variety
of
sextant
,
quadrant
,
telescope
,
astrolabe
,
and
other
astronomical
instrument
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
great
curiosity
,
upon
which
the
fate
of
the
island
depend
,
be
a
loadstone
of
a
prodigious
size
,
in
shape
resemble
a
weaver
's
shuttle
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
length
six
yard
,
and
in
the
thick
part
at
least
three
yard
over
.
 
<EOS>
this
magnet
be
sustain
by
a
very
strong
axle
of
adamant
pass
through
its
middle
,
upon
which
it
play
,
and
be
poise
so
exactly
that
the
weak
hand
can
turn
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
hoop
round
with
a
hollow
cylinder
of
adamant
,
four
foot
yard
in
diameter
,
place
horizontally
,
and
support
by
eight
adamantine
foot
,
each
six
yard
high
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
the
concave
side
,
there
be
a
groove
twelve
inch
<EOS>
deep
,
in
which
the
extremity
of
the
axle
be
lodge
,
and
turn
round
as
there
be
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
the
stone
can
not
be
remove
from
its
place
by
any
force
,
because
the
hoop
and
its
foot
be
one
continued
piece
with
that
body
of
adamant
which
constitute
the
bottom
of
the
island
.
  
<EOS>
by
mean
of
this
loadstone
,
the
island
be
make
to
rise
and
fall
,
and
move
from
one
place
to
another
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
with
respect
to
that
part
of
the
earth
over
which
the
monarch
preside
,
the
stone
be
endue
at
one
of
its
side
with
an
attractive
power
,
and
at
the
other
with
a
repulsive
.
 
<EOS>
upon
place
the
magnet
erect
,
with
its
attract
end
towards
the
earth
,
the
island
descend
;
but
when
the
repel
extremity
point
downwards
,
the
island
mount
directly
upwards
.
<EOS>
when
the
position
of
the
stone
be
oblique
,
the
motion
of
the
island
be
so
too
:
 
for
in
this
magnet
,
the
force
always
act
in
line
parallel
to
its
direction
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
oblique
motion
,
the
island
be
convey
to
different
part
of
the
monarch
's
dominion
.
 
<EOS>
to
explain
the
manner
of
its
progress
,
let
a
b
represent
a
line
draw
across
the
dominion
of
Balnibarbi
,
let
the
line
c
d
represent
the
loadstone
,
of
which
let
d
be
the
repelling
end
,
and
c
<EOS>
the
attract
end
,
the
island
be
over
C
:
let
the
stone
be
place
in
position
c
d
,
with
its
repelling
end
downwards
;
then
the
island
will
be
drive
upwards
obliquely
towards
D.
 
<EOS>
when
it
be
arrive
at
D
,
let
the
stone
be
turn
upon
its
axle
,
till
its
attract
end
point
towards
e
,
and
then
the
island
will
be
carry
obliquely
towards
e
;
where
,
if
the
stone
be
again
turn
upon
its
axle
till
it
stand
in
the
position
E
f
,
with
its
repelling
point
downwards
,
the
island
will
rise
obliquely
towards
F
,
where
,
by
direct
the
attract
end
towards
G
,
the
island
may
be
carry
to
g
,
and
from
g
to
h
,
by
turn
the
stone
,
so
as
to
make
its
repelling
extremity
to
point
directly
downward
.
 
<EOS>
and
thus
,
by
change
the
situation
of
the
stone
,
as
often
as
there
be
occasion
,
the
island
be
make
to
rise
and
fall
by
turn
in
an
oblique
direction
,
and
by
those
alternate
rising
and
falling
(
the
obliquity
be
not
considerable
)
be
convey
from
one
part
of
the
dominion
to
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
must
be
observe
,
that
this
island
can
not
move
beyond
the
extent
of
the
dominion
below
,
nor
can
it
rise
above
the
height
of
four
mile
.
 
<EOS>
for
which
the
astronomer
(
who
have
write
large
system
concern
the
stone
)
assign
the
follow
reason
:
 
that
the
magnetic
virtue
do
not
extend
beyond
the
distance
of
four
mile
,
and
that
the
mineral
,
which
act
upon
the
stone
in
the
bowel
of
the
earth
,
and
in
the
sea
about
six
league
distant
from
the
shore
,
be
not
diffuse
through
the
whole
globe
,
but
terminate
with
the
limit
of
the
king
's
dominion
;
and
it
be
easy
,
from
the
great
advantage
of
such
a
superior
situation
,
for
a
prince
to
bring
under
his
obedience
whatever
country
lie
within
the
attraction
of
that
magnet
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
stone
be
put
parallel
to
the
plane
of
the
horizon
,
the
island
stand
still
;
for
in
that
case
the
extremity
of
it
,
be
at
equal
distance
from
the
earth
,
act
with
equal
force
,
the
one
in
drawing
downward
,
the
other
in
push
upward
,
and
consequently
no
motion
can
ensue
.
  
<EOS>
this
loadstone
be
under
the
care
of
certain
astronomer
,
who
,
from
time
to
time
,
give
it
such
position
as
the
monarch
direct
.
 
<EOS>
They
spend
the
great
part
of
their
life
in
observe
the
celestial
body
,
which
they
do
by
the
assistance
of
glass
,
far
excel
our
in
goodness
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
although
their
large
telescope
do
not
exceed
three
foot
,
they
magnify
much
more
than
those
of
a
hundred
with
us
,
and
show
the
star
with
great
clearness
.
 
<EOS>
this
advantage
have
enable
them
to
extend
their
discovery
much
further
than
our
astronomer
in
Europe
;
for
they
have
make
a
catalogue
of
ten
thousand
fix
star
,
whereas
the
large
of
our
do
not
contain
above
one
third
part
of
that
number
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
likewise
discover
two
less
star
,
or
satellite
,
which
revolve
about
Mars
;
whereof
the
innermost
be
distant
from
the
centre
of
the
primary
planet
exactly
three
of
his
diameter
,
and
the
outermost
,
five
;
the
former
revolve
in
the
space
of
ten
hour
,
and
the
latter
in
twenty
-
one
and
a
half
;
so
that
the
square
of
their
periodical
time
be
very
near
in
the
same
proportion
with
the
cube
of
their
distance
from
the
centre
of
Mars
;
which
evidently
show
them
to
be
govern
by
the
same
law
of
gravitation
that
influence
the
other
heavenly
body
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
observe
ninety
-
three
different
comet
,
and
settle
their
period
with
great
exactness
.
 
<EOS>
if
this
be
true
(
and
they
affirm
it
with
great
confidence
)
<EOS>
it
be
much
to
be
wish
,
that
their
observation
be
make
public
,
whereby
the
theory
of
comet
,
which
at
present
be
very
lame
and
defective
,
may
be
bring
to
the
same
perfection
with
other
art
of
astronomy
.
  
<EOS>
the
king
would
be
the
most
absolute
prince
in
the
universe
,
if
he
could
but
prevail
on
a
ministry
to
join
with
him
;
but
these
have
their
estate
below
on
the
continent
,
and
consider
that
the
office
of
a
favourite
have
a
very
uncertain
tenure
,
would
never
consent
to
the
enslaving
of
their
country
.
  
<EOS>
if
any
town
should
engage
in
rebellion
or
mutiny
,
fall
into
violent
faction
,
or
refuse
to
pay
the
usual
tribute
,
the
king
have
two
method
of
reduce
them
to
obedience
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
and
the
mild
course
be
,
by
keep
the
island
hover
over
such
a
town
,
and
the
land
about
it
,
whereby
he
can
deprive
them
of
the
benefit
of
the
sun
and
the
rain
,
and
consequently
afflict
the
inhabitant
with
dearth
and
disease
:
 
and
if
the
crime
deserve
it
,
they
be
at
the
same
time
pelt
from
above
with
great
stone
,
against
which
they
have
no
defence
but
by
creep
into
cellar
or
cave
,
while
the
roof
of
their
house
be
beat
to
piece
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
they
still
continue
obstinate
,
or
offer
to
raise
insurrection
,
he
proceed
to
the
last
remedy
,
by
let
the
island
drop
directly
upon
their
head
,
which
make
a
universal
destruction
both
of
house
and
man
.
<EOS>
however
,
this
be
an
extremity
to
which
the
prince
be
seldom
drive
,
neither
indeed
be
he
willing
to
put
it
in
execution
;
nor
dare
his
minister
advise
him
to
an
action
,
which
,
as
it
would
render
them
odious
to
the
people
,
so
it
would
be
a
great
damage
to
their
own
estate
,
which
all
lie
below
;
for
the
island
be
the
king
's
demesne
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
still
indeed
a
more
weighty
reason
,
why
the
king
of
this
country
have
be
always
averse
from
execute
so
terrible
an
action
,
unless
upon
the
utmost
necessity
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
if
the
town
intend
to
be
destroy
should
have
in
it
any
tall
rock
,
as
it
generally
fall
out
in
the
large
city
,
a
situation
probably
choose
at
first
with
a
view
to
prevent
such
a
catastrophe
;
or
if
it
abound
in
high
spire
,
or
pillar
of
stone
,
a
sudden
fall
may
endanger
the
bottom
or
under
surface
of
the
island
,
which
,
although
it
consist
,
as
I
have
say
,
of
one
entire
adamant
,
two
hundred
yard
thick
,
may
happen
to
crack
by
too
great
a
shock
,
or
burst
by
approach
too
near
the
fire
from
the
house
below
,
as
the
back
,
both
of
iron
and
stone
,
will
often
do
in
our
chimney
.
 
<EOS>
of
all
this
the
people
be
well
apprised
,
and
understand
how
far
to
carry
their
obstinacy
,
where
their
liberty
or
property
be
concern
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
king
,
when
he
be
highest
provoked
,
and
most
determined
to
press
a
city
to
rubbish
,
order
the
island
to
descend
with
great
gentleness
,
out
of
a
pretence
of
tenderness
to
his
people
,
but
,
indeed
,
for
fear
of
break
the
adamantine
bottom
;
in
which
case
,
it
be
the
opinion
of
all
their
philosopher
,
that
the
loadstone
could
no
longer
hold
it
up
,
and
the
whole
mass
would
fall
to
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
by
a
fundamental
law
of
this
realm
,
neither
the
king
,
nor
either
of
his
two
eld
son
,
be
permit
to
leave
the
island
;
nor
the
queen
,
till
she
be
past
child
-
bearing
.
   
<EOS>
the
author
leave
Laputa
;
be
convey
to
Balnibarbi
;
arrive
at
the
metropolis
.
 
<EOS>

of
the

,
and
the
country

.
 
<EOS>
the
author
hospitably
receive
by
a
great
lord
.
 
<EOS>
His
conversation
with
that
lord
.
 
<EOS>
although
I
can
not
say
that
I
be
ill
treat
in
this
island
,
yet
I
must
confess
I
think
myself
too
much
neglect
,
not
without
some
degree
of
contempt
;
for
neither
prince
nor
people
appear
to
be
curious
in
any
part
of
knowledge
,
except
mathematic
and
music
,
wherein
I
be
far
their
inferior
,
and
upon
that
account
very
little
regard
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
other
side
,
after
have
see
all
the
curiosity
of
the
island
,
I
be
very
desirous
to
leave
it
,
be
heartily
weary
of
those
people
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
indeed
excellent
in
two
science
for
which
I
have
great
esteem
,
and
wherein
I
be
not
unversed
;
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
so
abstract
and
involve
in
speculation
,
that
I
never
meet
with
such
disagreeable
companion
.
 
<EOS>
I
converse
only
with
woman
,
tradesman
,
flapper
,
and
court
-
page
,
during
two
month
of
my
abode
there
;
by
which
,
at
last
,
I
render
myself
extremely
contemptible
;
yet
these
be
the
only
people
from
whom
I
could
ever
receive
a
reasonable
answer
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
obtain
,
by
hard
study
,
a
good
degree
of
knowledge
in
their
language
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
weary
of
be
confine
to
an
island
where
I
receive
so
little
countenance
,
and
resolve
to
leave
it
with
the
first
opportunity
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
lord
at
court
,
nearly
relate
to
the
king
,
and
for
that
reason
alone
use
with
respect
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
universally
reckon
the
most
ignorant
and
stupid
person
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
perform
many
eminent
service
for
the
crown
,
have
great
natural
and
acquired
part
,
adorn
with
integrity
and
honour
;
but
so
ill
an
ear
for
music
,
that
his
detractor
report
,
"
he
have
be
often
know
to
beat
time
in
the
wrong
place
;
"
neither
could
his
tutor
,
without
extreme
difficulty
,
teach
him
to
demonstrate
the
most
easy
proposition
in
the
mathematic
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
pleased
to
show
me
many
mark
of
favour
<EOS>
,
often
do
me
the
honour
of
a
visit
,
desire
to
be
inform
in
the
affair
of
Europe
,
the
law
and
custom
,
the
manner
and
learning
of
the
several
country
where
I
have
travel
.
 
<EOS>
He
listen
to
me
with
great
attention
,
and
make
very
wise
observation
on
all
I
speak
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
two
flapper
attend
him
for
state
,
but
never
make
use
of
them
,
except
at
court
and
in
visit
of
ceremony
,
and
would
always
command
them
to
withdraw
,
when
we
be
alone
together
.
  
<EOS>
I
entreat
this
illustrious
person
,
to
intercede
in
my
behalf
with
his
majesty
,
for
leave
to
depart
;
which
he
accordingly
do
,
as
he
be
pleased
to
tell
me
,
with
regret
:
 
<EOS>
for
indeed
he
have
make
me
several
offer
very
advantageous
,
which
,
however
,
I
refuse
,
with
expression
of
the
high
acknowledgment
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
16th
of
February
I
take
leave
of
his
majesty
and
the
court
.
<EOS>
the
king
make
me
a
present
to
the
value
of
about
two
hundred
pound
English
,
and
my
protector
,
his
kinsman
,
as
much
more
,
together
with
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
a
friend
of
his
in
Lagado
,
the
metropolis
.
 
<EOS>
the
island
be
then
hover
over
a
mountain
about
two
mile
from
it
,
I
be
let
down
from
the
low
gallery
,
in
the
same
manner
as
I
have
be
take
up
.
  
<EOS>
the
continent
,
as
far
as
it
be
subject
to
the
monarch
of
the
fly
island
,
pass
under
the
general
name
of
Balnibarbi
;
and
the
metropolis
,
as
I
say
before
,
be
call
Lagado
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
some
little
satisfaction
in
find
myself
on
firm
ground
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
to
the
city
without
any
concern
,
be
clothe
like
one
of
the
native
,
and
sufficiently
instruct
to
converse
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
soon
find
out
the
person
's
house
to
whom
I
be
recommend
,
present
my
letter
from
his
friend
the
grandee
in
the
island
,
and
be
receive
with
much
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
this
great
lord
,
whose
name
be
Munodi
,
order
me
an
apartment
in
his
own
house
,
where
I
continue
during
my
stay
,
and
be
entertain
in
a
most
hospitable
manner
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
after
my
arrival
,
he
take
me
in
his
chariot
to
see
the
town
,
which
be
about
half
the
bigness
of
London
;
but
the
house
very
strangely
build
,
and
most
of
them
out
of
repair
.
 
<EOS>
the
people
in
the
street
walk
fast
,
look
wild
,
their
eye
fix
,
and
be
generally
in
rag
.
 
<EOS>
We
pass
through
one
of
the
town
gate
,
and
go
about
three
mile
into
the
country
,
where
I
see
many
labourer
work
with
several
sort
of
tool
in
the
ground
,
but
be
not
able
to
conjecture
what
they
be
about
:
 
neither
do
observe
any
expectation
either
of
corn
or
grass
,
although
the
soil
appear
to
be
excellent
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
forbear
admiring
at
these
odd
appearance
,
both
in
town
and
country
;
and
I
make
bold
to
desire
my
conductor
,
that
he
would
be
pleased
to
explain
to
me
<EOS>
,
what
could
be
mean
by
so
many
busy
head
,
hand
,
and
face
,
both
in
the
street
and
the
field
,
because
I
do
not
discover
any
good
effect
they
produce
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
I
never
know
a
soil
so
unhappily
cultivate
,
house
so
ill
contrived
and
so
ruinous
,
or
a
people
whose
countenance
and
habit
express
so
much
misery
and
want
.
  
<EOS>
this
lord
Munodi
be
a
person
of
the
first
rank
,
and
have
be
some
year
governor
of
Lagado
;
but
,
by
a
cabal
of
minister
,
be
discharge
for
insufficiency
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
the
king
treat
him
with
tenderness
,
as
a
well
-
mean
man
,
but
of
a
low
contemptible
understanding
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
give
that
free
censure
of
the
country
and
its
inhabitant
,
he
make
no
further
answer
than
by
tell
me
,
"
that
I
have
not
be
long
enough
among
them
to
form
a
judgment
;
and
that
the
different
nation
of
the
world
have
different
custom
;
"
with
other
common
topic
to
the
same
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
when
we
return
to
his
palace
,
he
ask
me
"
how
I
like
the
building
,
what
absurdity
I
observe
,
and
what
quarrel
I
have
with
the
dress
or
look
of
his
domestic
?
<EOS>
"
this
he
may
safely
do
;
because
every
thing
about
him
be
magnificent
,
regular
,
and
polite
.
 
<EOS>
I
answer
,
"
that
his
excellency
's
prudence
,
quality
,
and
fortune
,
have
exempt
him
from
those
defect
,
which
folly
and
beggary
have
produce
in
other
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
if
I
would
go
with
him
to
his
country
-
house
,
about
twenty
mile
distant
,
where
his
estate
lie
,
there
would
be
more
leisure
for
this
kind
of
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
tell
his
excellency
"
that
I
be
entirely
at
his
disposal
;
"
and
accordingly
we
set
out
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
during
our
journey
he
make
me
observe
the
several
method
use
by
farmer
in
manage
their
land
,
which
to
me
be
wholly
unaccountable
;
for
,
except
in
some
very
few
place
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
discover
one
ear
of
corn
or
blade
of
grass
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
in
three
hour
travel
,
the
scene
be
wholly
alter
;
we
come
into
a
most
beautiful
country
;
farmer
'
house
,
at
small
distance
,
neatly
build
;
the
field
enclose
,
contain
vineyard
,
corn
-
ground
,
and
meadow
.
 
<EOS>
neither
<EOS>
do
I
remember
to
have
see
a
more
delightful
prospect
.
 
<EOS>
His
excellency
observe
my
countenance
to
clear
up
;
he
tell
me
,
with
a
sigh
,
"
that
there
his
estate
begin
,
and
would
continue
the
same
,
till
we
should
come
to
his
house
:
 
that
his
countryman
ridicule
and
despise
him
,
for
manage
his
affair
no
better
,
and
for
set
so
ill
an
example
to
the
kingdom
;
which
,
however
,
be
follow
by
very
few
,
such
as
be
old
,
and
wilful
,
and
weak
like
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
come
at
length
to
the
house
,
which
be
indeed
a
noble
structure
,
build
accord
to
the
good
rule
of
ancient
architecture
.
 
<EOS>
the
fountain
,
garden
,
walks
,
avenue
,
and
grove
,
be
all
dispose
with
exact
judgment
and
taste
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
due
praise
to
every
thing
I
see
,
whereof
his
excellency
take
not
the
least
notice
till
after
supper
;
<EOS>
when
,
there
be
no
third
companion
,
he
tell
me
with
a
very
melancholy
air
"
that
he
doubt
he
must
throw
down
his
house
in
town
and
country
,
to
rebuild
them
after
the
present
mode
;
destroy
all
his
plantation
,
and
cast
other
into
such
a
form
as
modern
usage
require
,
and
give
the
same
direction
to
all
his
tenant
,
unless
he
would
submit
to
incur
the
censure
of
pride
,
singularity
,
affectation
,
ignorance
,
caprice
,
and
perhaps
increase
his
majesty
's
displeasure
;
that
the
admiration
I
appear
to
be
under
would
cease
or
diminish
,
when
he
have
inform
me
of
some
particular
which
,
probably
,
I
never
hear
of
at
court
,
the
people
there
be
too
much
take
up
in
their
own
speculation
,
to
have
regard
to
what
pass
here
below
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
sum
of
his
discourse
be
to
this
effect
:
 
"
that
about
forty
year
ago
,
certain
person
go
up
to
Laputa
,
either
upon
business
or
diversion
,
and
,
after
five
month
continuance
,
come
back
with
a
very
little
smatter
in
mathematic
,
but
full
of
volatile
spirit
acquire
in
that
airy
region
:
 
that
these
person
,
upon
their
return
,
begin
to
dislike
the
management
of
every
thing
below
,
and
fall
into
scheme
of
put
all
art
,
science
,
language
,
and
mechanic
,
upon
a
new
foot
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
end
,
they
procure
a
royal
patent
for
erect
an
academy
of
projector
in
Lagado
;
and
the
humour
prevail
so
strongly
among
the
people
,
that
there
be
not
a
town
of
any
consequence
in
the
kingdom
without
such
an
academy
.
 
<EOS>
in
these
college
the
professor
contrive
new
rule
and
method
of
agriculture
and
building
,
and
new
instrument
,
and
tool
for
all
trade
and
manufacture
;
<EOS>
whereby
,
as
they
undertake
,
one
man
shall
do
the
work
of
ten
;
a
palace
may
be
build
in
a
week
,
of
material
so
durable
as
to
last
for
ever
without
repair
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
fruit
of
the
earth
shall
come
to
maturity
at
whatever
season
we
think
fit
to
choose
,
and
increase
a
hundred
fold
more
than
they
do
at
present
;
with
innumerable
other
happy
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
inconvenience
be
,
that
none
of
these
project
be
yet
bring
to
perfection
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
the
whole
country
lie
miserably
waste
,
the
house
in
ruin
,
and
the
people
without
food
or
clothe
.
<EOS>
by
all
which
,
instead
of
be
discourage
,
they
be
fifty
time
more
violently
bent
upon
prosecute
their
scheme
,
drive
equally
on
by
hope
and
despair
:
 
that
as
for
himself
,
be
not
of
an
enterprising
spirit
,
he
be
content
to
go
on
in
the
old
form
,
to
live
in
the
house
his
ancestor
have
build
,
and
act
as
they
do
,
in
every
part
of
life
,
without
innovation
:
 
that
some
few
other
person
of
quality
and
gentry
have
do
the
same
,
but
be
look
on
with
an
eye
of
contempt
and
ill
-
will
,
as
enemy
to
art
,
ignorant
,
and
ill
common
-
wealth
's
man
,
prefer
their
own
ease
and
sloth
before
the
general
improvement
of
their
country
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
add
,
"
that
he
would
not
,
by
any
further
particular
,
prevent
the
pleasure
<EOS>
I
should
certainly
take
in
view
the
grand
academy
,
whither
<EOS>
he
be
resolve
I
should
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
only
desire
me
to
observe
a
ruin
building
,
upon
the
side
of
a
mountain
about
three
mile
distant
,
of
which
he
give
me
this
account
:
 
<EOS>
"
that
he
have
a
very
convenient
mill
within
half
a
mile
of
his
house
,
turn
by
a
current
from
a
large
river
,
and
sufficient
for
his
own
family
,
as
well
as
a
great
number
of
his
tenant
;
that
about
seven
year
ago
,
a
club
of
those
projector
come
to
him
with
proposal
to
destroy
this
mill

and
build
another
on
the
side
of
that
mountain
,
on
the
long
ridge
<EOS>
whereof
a
long
canal
must
be
cut
,
for
a
repository
of
water
,
to
be
convey
up
by
pipe
and
engine
to
supply
the
mill
,
because
the
wind
and
air
upon
a
height
agitate
the
water
,
and
thereby
make
it
fitter
for
motion
,
and
because
the
water
,
descend
down
a
declivity
,
would
turn
the
mill
with
half
the
current
of
a
river
whose
course
be
more
upon
a
level

"
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
that
be
then
not
very
well
with
the
court
,
and
press
by
many
of
his
friend
,
he
comply
with
the
proposal
;
and
after
employ
a
hundred
man
for
two
year
,
the
work
miscarry
,
the
projector
go
off
,
lay
the
blame
entirely
upon
him
,
rail
at
him
ever
since

put
other
upon
the

experiment

with
equal
assurance
of
success

as
well
as
equal
disappointment

"
  
<EOS>
in
a
few
day
we
come
back
to
town
;
and
his
excellency
,
consider
the
bad
character
he
have
in
the
academy
,
would
not
go
with
me
himself
,
but
recommend
me
to
a
friend
of
his
,
to
bear
me
company
thither
.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
be
pleased
to
represent
me
as
a
great
admirer
of
project
,
and
a
person
of
much
curiosity
and
easy
belief
;
which
,
indeed
,
be
not
without
truth
<EOS>
;
for
I
have
myself
be
a
sort
of
projector
in
my
young
day
.
   
<EOS>
the
author
permit
to
see
the
grand
academy
of
Lagado
.
 
<EOS>
the
academy
largely
describe
.
 
<EOS>
the
art
wherein
the
professor
employ
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
this
academy
be
not
an
entire
single
building
,
but
a
continuation
of
several
house
on
both
side
of
a
street
,
which
grow
waste
,
be
purchase
and
apply
to
that
use
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
receive
very
kindly
by
the
warden
,
and
go
for
many
day
to
the
academy
.
 
<EOS>
every
room
have
in
it
one
or
more
projector
;
and
I
believe
I
could
not
be
in
few
than
five
hundred
room
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
man
I
see
be
of
a
meagre
aspect
,
with
sooty
hand
and
face
,
his
hair
and
beard
long
,
ragged
,
and
singe
in
several
place
.
 
<EOS>
His
clothe
,
shirt
,
and
skin
,
be
all
of
the
same
colour
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
eight
year
upon
a
project
for
extract
sunbeam
out
of
cucumber
,
which
be
to
be
put
in
phial
hermetically
seal
,
and
let
out
to
warm
the
air
in
raw
inclement
summer
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
he
do
not
doubt
,
that
,
in
eight
year
more
,
he
should
be
able
to
supply
the
governor
's
garden
with
sunshine
,
at
a
reasonable
rate
:
but
he
complain
that
his
stock
be
low
,
and
entreat
me
"
to
give
him
something
as
an
encouragement
to
ingenuity
,
especially
since
this
have
be
a
very
dear
season
for
cucumber
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
make
him
a
small
present
,
for
my
lord
have
furnish
me
with
money
on
purpose
,
because
he
know
their
practice
of
beg
from
all
who
go
to
see
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
into
another
chamber
,
but
be
ready
to
hasten
back
,
be
almost
overcome
with
a
horrible
stink
.
 
<EOS>
My
conductor
press
me
forward
,
conjure
me
in
a
whisper
"
to
give
no
offence
,
which
would
be
highly
resent
;
"
and
therefore
I
durst
not
so
much
as
stop
my
nose
.
 
<EOS>
the
projector
of
this
cell
be
the
most
ancient
student
of
the
academy
;
his
face
and
beard
be
of
a
pale
yellow
;
his
hand
and
clothe
daub
over
with
filth
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
be
present
to
him
,
he
give
me
a
close
embrace
,
a
compliment
I
could
well
have
excuse
.
<EOS>
His
employment
,
from
his
first
come
into
the
academy
,
be
an
operation
to
reduce
human
excrement
to
its
original
food
,
by
separate
the
several
part
,
remove
the
tincture
which
it
receive
from
the
gall
,
make
the
odour
exhale
,
and
scum
off
the
saliva
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
weekly
allowance
,
from
the
society
,
of
a
vessel
fill
with
human
ordure
,
about
the
bigness
of
a
Bristol
barrel
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
another
at
work
to
calcine
ice
into
gunpowder
;
who
likewise
show
me
a
treatise
he
have
write
concern
the
malleability
of
fire
,
which
he
intend
to
publish
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
most
ingenious
architect
,
who
have
contrive
a
new
method
for
build
house
,
by
begin
at
the
roof
,
and
work
downward
to
the
foundation
;
which
he
justify
to
me
,
by
the
like
practice
of
those
two
prudent
insect
,
the
bee
and
the
spider
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
man
bear
blind
,
who
have
several
apprentice
in
his
own
condition
:
 
their
employment
be
to
mix
colour
for
painter
,
which
their
master
teach
them
to
distinguish
by
feel
and
smell
.
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
my
misfortune
to
find
them
at
that
time
not
very
perfect
in
their
lesson
,
and
the
professor
himself
happen
to
be
generally
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
this
artist
be
much
encourage
and
esteem
by
the
whole
fraternity
.
  
<EOS>
in
another
apartment
I
be
highly
pleased
with
a
projector
who
have
find
a
device
of
plough
the
ground
with
hog
,
to
save
the
charge
of
plough
,
cattle
,
and
labour
.
 
<EOS>
the
method
be
this
:
 
in
an
acre
of
ground
you
bury
,
at
six
inch
distance
and
eight
deep
,
a
quantity
of
acorn
,
date
,
chestnut
,
and
other
mast
or
vegetable
<EOS>
,
whereof
these
animal
be
fond
;
then
you
drive
six
hundred
or
more
of
them
into
the
field
,
where
,
in
a
few
day
,
they
will
root
up
the
whole
ground
in
search
of
their
food
,
and
make
it
fit
for
sow
,
at
the
same
time
manure
it
with
their
dung
:
 
it
be
true
,
upon
experiment
<EOS>
,
they
find
the
charge
and
trouble
very
great
,
and
they
have
little
or
no
crop
.
 
<EOS>
however
it
be
not
doubt
,
that
this
invention
may
be
capable
of
great
improvement
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
into
another
room
,
where
the
wall
and
ceiling
be
all
hang
round
with
cobwebs
,
except
a
narrow
passage
for
the
artist
to
go
in
and
out
.
 
<EOS>
at
my
entrance
,
he
call
aloud
to
me
,
"
not
to
disturb
his
webs
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
lament
"
<EOS>
the
fatal
mistake
the
world
have
be
so
long
in
,
of
use
silkworm
,
while
we
have
such
plenty
of
domestic
insect
who
infinitely
excel
the
former
,
because
they
understand
how
to
weave
,
as
well
as
spin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
he
propose
further
,
"
that
by
employ
spider
,
the
charge
of
dye
silk
should
be
wholly
save
;
"
whereof
<EOS>
I
be
fully
convince
,
<EOS>
when
he
show
me
a
vast
number
of
fly
most
beautifully
colour
,
wherewith
he
feed
his
spider
,
assure
us
"
that
the
webs
would
take
a
tincture
from
them
;
and
as
he
have
them
of
all
hue
,
he
hope
to
fit
everybody
's
fancy
,
as
soon
as
he
could
find
proper
food
for
the
fly
,
of
certain
gum
,
oil
,
and
other
glutinous
matter
,
to
give
a
strength
and
consistence
to
the
thread
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
an
astronomer
,
who
have
undertake
to
place
a
sun
-
dial
upon
the
great
weathercock
on
the
town
-
house
,
by
adjust
the
annual
and
diurnal
motion
of
the
earth
and
sun
,
so
as
to
answer
and
coincide
with
all
accidental
turning
of
the
wind
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
complain
of
a
small
fit
of
the
colic
,
upon
which
my
conductor
lead
me
into
a
room
where
a
great
physician
reside
,
who
be
famous
for
cure
that
disease
,
by
contrary
operation
from
the
same
instrument
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
large
pair
of
bellow
,
with
a
long
slender
muzzle
of
ivory
:
 
this
he
convey
eight
inch
up
the
anus
,
and
draw
in
the
wind
,
he
affirm
he
could
make
the
gut
as
lank
as
a
dry
bladder
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
the
disease
be
more
stubborn
and
violent
,
he
let
in
the
muzzle
while
the
bellow
be
full
of
wind
,
which
he
discharge
into
the
body
of
the
patient
;
then
withdraw
the
instrument
to
replenish
it
,
clap
his
thumb
strongly
against
the
orifice
of
then
fundament
;
and
this
be
repeat
three
or
four
time
,
the
adventitious
wind
would
rush
out
,
bring
the
noxious
along
with
it
,
(
like
water
put
into
a
pump
)
,
and
the
patient
recover
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
try
both
experiment
upon
a
dog
,
but
could
not
discern
any
effect
from
the
former
.
 
<EOS>
after
the
latter
the
animal
be
ready
to
burst
,
and
make
so
violent
<EOS>
a
discharge
as
be
very
offensive
to
me
and
my
companion
.
 
<EOS>
the
dog
die
on
the
spot
,
and
we
leave
the
doctor
endeavour
to
recover
him
,
by
the
same
operation
.
  
<EOS>
I
visit
many
other
apartment
,
but
shall
not
trouble
my
reader
with
all
the
curiosity
I
observe
,
be
studious
of
brevity
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
hitherto
see
only
one
side
of
the
academy
,
the
other
be
appropriate
to
the
advancer
of
speculative
learning
,
of
whom
I
shall
say
something
,
when
I
have
mention
one
illustrious
person
more
,
who
be
call
among
them
"
the
universal
artist
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
tell
us
"
he
have
be
thirty
year
employ
his
thought
for
the
improvement
of
human
life
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
have
two
large
room
full
of
wonderful
curiosity
,
and
fifty
man
at
work
.
 
<EOS>
some
be
condense
air
into
a
dry
tangible
substance
,
by
extract
the
nitre
,
and
let
the
aqueous
or
fluid
particle
percolate
;
other
soften
marble
,
for
pillow
and
pin
-
cushion
;
other
petrify
the
hoofs
of
a
live
horse
,
to
preserve
them
from
founder
.
 
<EOS>
the
artist
himself
be
at
that
time
busy
upon
two
great
design
;
the
first
,
to
sow
land
with
chaff
,
wherein
he
affirm
the
true
seminal
virtue
to
be
contain
,
as
he
demonstrate
by
several
experiment
,
which
I
be
not
skilful
enough
to
comprehend
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
be
,
by
a
certain
composition
of
gum
,
mineral
,
and
vegetable
,
outwardly
apply
,
to
prevent
the
growth
of
wool
upon
two
young
lamb
;
and
he
hope
,
in
a
reasonable
time
to
propagate
the
breed
of
naked
sheep
,
all
over
the
kingdom
.
  
<EOS>
We
cross
a
walk
to
the
other
part
of
the
academy
,
where
,
as
I
have
already
say
,
the
projector
in
speculative
learning
reside
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
professor
I
see
,
be
in
a
very
large
room
,
with
forty
pupil
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
after
salutation
,
observe
me
to
look
earnestly
upon
a
frame
,
which
take
up
the
great
part
of
both
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
room
,
he
say
,
"
perhaps
I
may
wonder
to
see
him
employ
in
a
project
for
improve
speculative
knowledge
,
by
practical
and
mechanical
operation
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
world
would
soon
be
sensible
of
its
usefulness
;
and
he
flatter
himself
,
that
a
more
noble
,
exalted
think
never
spring
in
any
other
man
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
every
one
know
how
laborious
the
usual
method
be
of
attain
to
art
and
science
;
whereas
,
by
his
contrivance
,
the
most
ignorant
person
,
at
a
reasonable
charge
,
and
with
a
little
bodily
labour
,
may
write
book
in
philosophy
,
poetry
,
politic
,
law
,
mathematic
,
and
theology
,
without
the
least
assistance
from
genius
or
study
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
lead
me
to
the
frame
,
about
the
side
,
whereof
all
his
pupil
stand
in
rank
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
twenty
foot
square
,
place
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
the
superfice
be
compose
of
several
bit
of
wood
,
about
the
bigness
of
a
die
,
but
some
large
than
other
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
all
link
together
by
slend
wire
.
 
<EOS>
these
bit
of
wood
be
cover
,
on
every
square
,
with
paper
paste
on
them
;
and
on
these
paper
be
write
all
the
word
of
their
language
,
in
their
several
mood
,
tense
,
and
declension
;
but
without
any
order
.
 
<EOS>
the
professor
then
desire
me
"
to
observe
;
for
he
be
go
to
set
his
engine
at
work
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
pupil
,
at
his
command
,
take
each
of
them
hold
of
an
iron
handle
,
whereof
there
be
forty
fix
round
the
edge
of
the
frame
;
and
give
them
a
sudden
turn
,
the
whole
disposition
of
the
word
be
entirely
change
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
command
six
-
and
-
thirty
of
the
lad
,
to
read
the
several
line
softly
,
as
they
appear
upon
the
frame
;
and
where
they
find
three
or
four
word
together
that
may
make
part
of
a
sentence
,
they
dictate
to
the
four
remain
boy
,
who
be
scribe
.
 
<EOS>
this
work
be
repeat
three
or
four
time
,
and
at
every
turn
,
the
engine
be
so
contrived
,
that
the
word
shift
into
new
place
,
as
the
square
bit
of
wood
move
upside
down
.
  
<EOS>
six
hour
a
day
the
young
student
be
employ
in
this
labour
;
and
the
professor
show
me
several
volume
in
large
folio
,
already
collect
,
of
broken
sentence
,
which
he
intend
to
piece
together
,
and
out
of
those
rich
material
,
to
give
the
world
a
complete
body
of
all
art
and
science
;
which
,
however
,
may
be
still
improve
,
and
much
expedite
,
if
the
public
would
raise
a
fund
for
make
and
employ
five
hundred
such
frame
in
Lagado
,
and
oblige
the
manager
to
contribute
in
common
their
several
collection
.
  
<EOS>
He
assure
me
"
that
this
invention
have
employ
all
his
thought
from
his
youth
;
that
he
have
empty
the
whole
vocabulary
into
his
frame
,
and
make
the
strict
computation
of
the
general
proportion
there
be
in
book
between
the
number
of
particle

noun
,
and
verb
,
and
other
part
of
speech

"
  
<EOS>
I
make
my
humblest
acknowledgment
to
this
illustrious
person
,
for
his
great
communicativeness
;
and
promise
,
"
if
ever
I
have
the
good
fortune
to
return
to
my
native
country

that
I
would
do
him
justice

as
the
sole
inventor

this
wonderful
machine
;
"
the
form
and
contrivance
of
which
I
desire
leave
to
delineate
on
paper
,
as
in
the
figure
here
annex

<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
"
although
it
be
the
custom
of
our
learn
in
Europe
to
steal
invention
from
each
other
,
who
have
thereby
at
least
this
advantage
,
that
it
become
a
controversy
which
be
the
right
owner
;
yet
I
would
take
such
caution
,
that
he
should
have
the
honour
entire
,
without
a
rival
.

<EOS>
We
next
go
to
the
school
of
language
,
where
three
professor
sit
in
consultation
upon
improve
that
of
their
own
country
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
project
be
,
to
shorten
discourse
,
by
cut
polysyllable
into
one
,
and
leave
out
verb
and
participle
,
because
,
in
reality
,
all
thing
imaginable
be
but
norm
.
  
<EOS>
the
other
project
be
,
a
scheme
for
entirely
abolish
all
word
whatsoever
;
and
this
be
urge
as
a
great
advantage
in
point
of
health
,
as
well
as
brevity
.
 
<EOS>
for
it
be
plain
,
that
every
word
we
speak
be
,
in
some
degree
,
a
diminution
of
our
lunge
by
corrosion
,
and
,
consequently
,
contribute
to
the
shortening
of
our
life
.
 
<EOS>
an
expedient
be
therefore
offer
,
"
that
since
word
be
only
name
for
thing
,
it
would
be
more
convenient
for
all
man
to
carry
about
them
such
thing
as
be
necessary
to
express
a
particular
business
they
be
to
discourse
on
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
this
invention
would
certainly
have
take
place
,
to
the
great
ease
as
well
as
health
of
the
subject
,
if
the
woman
,
in
conjunction
with
the
vulgar
and
illiterate
,
have
not
threaten
to
raise
a
rebellion
unless
they
may
be
allow
the
liberty
to
speak
with
their
tongue
,
after
the
manner
of
their
forefather
;
such
constant
irreconcilable
enemy
to
science
be
the
common
people
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
many
of
the
most
learned
and
wise
adhere
to
the
new
scheme
of
express
themselves
by
thing
;
which
have
only
this
inconvenience
attend
it
,
that
if
a
man
's
business
be
very
great
,
and
of
various
kind
,
he
must
be
oblige
,
in
proportion
,
to
carry
a
great
bundle
of
thing
upon
his
back
,
unless
he
can
afford
one
or
two
strong
servant
to
attend
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
behold
two
of
those
sage
almost
sink
under
the
weight
of
their
pack
,
like
pedlar
among
us
,
who
,
when
they
meet
in
the
street
,
would
lay
down
their
load
,
open
their
sack
,
and
hold
conversation
for
an
hour
together
;
then
put
up
their
implement
,
help
each
other
to
resume
their
burden
,
and
take
their
leave
.
  
<EOS>
but
for
short
conversation
,
a
man
may
carry
implement
in
his
pocket
,
and
under
his
arm
,
enough
to
supply
him
;
and
in
his
house
,
he
can
not
be
at
a
loss
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
the
room
where
company
meet
who
practise
this
art
,
be
full
of
all
thing
,
ready
at
hand
,
requisite
to
furnish
matter
for
this
kind
of
artificial
converse
.
  
<EOS>
another
great
advantage
propose
by
this
invention
be
,
that
it
would
serve
as
a
universal
language
,
to
be
understand
in
all
civilised
nation
,
whose
good
and
utensil
be
generally
of
the
same
kind
,
or
nearly
resemble
,
so
that
their
use
may
easily
be
comprehend
.
 
<EOS>
and
thus
ambassador
would
be
qualified
to
treat
with
foreign
prince
,
or
minister
of
state
,
<EOS>
to
whose
tongue
they
be
utter
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
at
the
mathematical
school
,
where
the
master
teach
his
pupil
after
a
method
scarce
imaginable
to
us
in
Europe
.
 
<EOS>
the
proposition
,
and
demonstration
,
be
fairly
write
on
a
thin
wafer
,
with
ink
compose
of
a
cephalic
tincture
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
the
student
be
to
swallow
upon
a
fast
stomach
,
and
for
three
day
follow
,
eat
nothing
but
bread
and
water
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
wafer
digest
,
the
tincture
mount
to
his
brain
,
bear
the
proposition
along
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
success
have
not
hitherto
be
answerable
,
partly
by
some
error
in
the
quantum
or
composition
,
and
partly
by
the
perverseness
of
lad
,
to
whom
this
bolus
be
so
nauseous
,
that
they
generally
steal
aside
,
and
discharge
it
upwards
,
before
it
can
operate
;
neither
have
they
be
yet
persuade
to
use
so
long
an
abstinence
,
as
the
prescription
require
.
   
<EOS>
a
further
account
of
the
academy
.
 
<EOS>
the
author
propose
some
improvement
,
which
be
honourably
receive
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
school
of
political
projector
,
I
be
but
ill
entertain
;
the
professor
appear
,
in
my
judgment
,
wholly
out
of
their
sense
,
which
be
a
scene
that
never
fail
to
make
me
melancholy
.
<EOS>
these
unhappy
people
be
propose
scheme
for
persuade
monarchs
to
choose
favourite
upon
the
score
of
their
wisdom
,
capacity
,
and
virtue
;
of
teach
minister
to
consult
the
public
good
;
of
rewarding
merit
,
great
ability
,
eminent
service
;
of
instruct
prince
to
know
their
true
interest
,
by
place
it
on
the
same
foundation
with
that
of
their
people
;
of
choose
for
employment
person
qualified
to
exercise
them
,
with
many
other
wild
,
impossible
chimera
,
that
never
enter
before
into
the
heart
of
man
to
conceive
;
and
confirm
in
me
the
old
observation
,
"
that
there
be
nothing
so
extravagant
and
irrational
,
which
some
philosopher
have
not
maintain
for
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
I
shall
so
far
do
justice
to
this
part
of
the
Academy
,
as
to
acknowledge
that
all
of
them
be
not
so
visionary
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
most
ingenious
doctor
,
who
seem
to
be
perfectly
verse
in
the
whole
nature
and
system
of
government
.
 
<EOS>
this
illustrious
person
have
very
usefully
employ
his
study
,
in
find
out
effectual
remedy
for
all
disease
and
corruption
to
which
the
several
kind
of
public
administration
be
subject
,
by
the
vice
or
infirmity
of
those
who
govern
,
as
well
as
by
the
licentiousness
of
those
who
be
to
obey
.
 
<EOS>
for
instance
:
 
whereas
all
writer
and
reasoner
have
agree
,
that
there
be
a
strict
universal
resemblance
between
the
natural
and
the
political
body
;
can
there
be
any
thing
more
evident
,
than
that
the
health
of
both
must
be
preserve
,
and
the
disease
cure
,
by
the
same
prescription
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
allow
,
that
senate
and
great
council
be
often
troubled
with
redundant
,
ebullient
,
and
other
peccant
humour
;
with
many
disease
of
the
head
,
and
more
of
the
heart
;
with
strong
convulsion
,
with
grievous
contraction
of
the
nerve
and
sinew
in
both
hand
,
but
especially
the
right
;
with
spleen
,
flatus
,
vertigos
,
and
delirium
;
with
scrofulous
tumour
,
full
of
fetid
purulent
matter
;
with
sour
frothy
ructation
:
 
with
canine
appetite
,
and
crudeness
of
digestion
,
besides
many
other
,
needless
to
mention
.
 
<EOS>
this
doctor
therefore
propose
,
"
that
upon
the
meeting
of
the
senate
,
certain
physician
should
attend
it
the
three
first
day
of
their
sitting
,
and
at
the
close
of
each
day
's
debate
feel
the
pulse
of
every
senator
;
after
which
,
have
maturely
consider
and
consult
upon
the
nature
of
the
several
malady
,
and
the
method
of
cure
,
they
should
on
the
fourth
day
return
to
the
senate
house
,
attend
by
their
apothecary
store
with
proper
medicine
;
and
before
the
member
sit
,
administer
to
each
of
them
lenitive
,
aperitif
,
abstersive
,
corrosive
,
restringent
,
palliative
,
laxative
,
cephalalgic
,
icteric
,
apophlegmatic
,
acoustic
,
as
their
several
case
require
;
and
,
accord
as
these
medicine
should
operate
,
repeat
,
alter
,
or
omit
them
,
at
the
next
meeting
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
project
could
not
be
of
any
great
expense
to
the
public
;
and
may
in
my
poor
opinion
,
be
of
much
use
for
the
despatch
of
business
,
in
those
country
where
senate
have
any
share
in
the
legislative
power
;
beget
unanimity
,
shorten
debate
,
open
a
few
mouth
which
be
now
closed
,
and
close
many
more
which
be
now
open
;
curb
the
petulancy
of
the
young
,
and
correct
the
positiveness
of
the
old
;
rouse
the
stupid
,
and
damp
the
pert
.
  
<EOS>
again
:
 
because
it
be
a
general
complaint
,
that
the
favourite
of
prince
be
troubled
with
short
and
weak
memory
;
the
same
doctor
propose
,
"
that
whoever
attend
a
first
minister
,
after
have
tell
his
business
,
with
the
utmost
brevity
and
in
the
plain
word
,
should
,
at
his
departure
,
give
the
say
minister
a
tweak
by
the
nose
,
or
a
kick
in
the
belly
,
or
tread
on
his
corn
,
or
lug
him
thrice
by
both
ear
,
or
run
a
pin
into
his
breech
;
or
pinch
his
arm
black
and
blue
,
to
prevent
forgetfulness
;
and
at
every
levee
day
,
repeat
the
same
operation
,
till
the
business
be
do
,
or
absolutely
refuse
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
likewise
direct
,
"
that
every
senator
in
the
great
council
of
a
nation
,
after
he
have
deliver
his
opinion
,
and
argue
in
the
defence
of
it
,
should
be
oblige
to
give
his
vote
directly
contrary
;
because
if
that
be
do
,
the
result
would
infallibly
terminate
in
the
good
of
the
public
.
"
  
<EOS>
when
party
in
a
state
be
violent
,
he
offer
a
wonderful
contrivance
to
reconcile
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
method
be
this
:
 
<EOS>
You
take
a
hundred
leader
of
each
party
;
you
dispose
them
into
couple
of
such
whose
head
be
near
of
a
size
;
then
let
two
nice
operator
see
off
the
occiput
of
each
couple
at
the
same
time
,
in
such
a
manner
that
the
brain
may
be
equally
divide
.
 
<EOS>
let
the
occiput
,
thus
cut
off
,
be
interchange
,
apply
each
to
the
head
of
his
opposite
party
-
man
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
indeed
to
be
a
work
that
require
some
exactness
,
but
the
professor
assure
us
,
"
that
if
it
be
dexterously
perform
,
the
cure
would
be
infallible
.
"
 
<EOS>
for
he
argue
thus
:
 
"
that
the
two
half
brain
be
leave
to
debate
the
matter
between
themselves
within
the
space
of
one
skull
,
would
soon
come
to
a
good
understanding
,
and
produce
that
moderation
,
as
well
as
regularity
of
thinking
,
so
much
to
be
wish
for
in
the
head
of
those
,
who
imagine
they
come
into
the
world
only
to
watch
and
govern
its
motion
:
 
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
difference
of
brain
,
in
quantity
or
quality
,
among
those
who
be
director
in
faction
,
the
doctor
assure
us
,
from
his
own
knowledge
,
that
"
it
be
a
perfect
trifle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hear
a
very
warm
debate
between
two
professor
,
about
the
most
commodious
and
effectual
way
and
mean
of
raise
money
,
without
grieve
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
affirmed
,
"
the
just
method
would
be
,
to
lay
a
certain
tax
upon
vice
and
folly
;
and
the
sum
fix
upon
every
man
to
be
rate
,
after
the
fair
manner
,
by
a
jury
of
his
neighbour
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
second
be
of
an
opinion
directly
contrary
;
"
to
tax
those
quality
of
body
and
mind
,
for
which
man
chiefly
value
themselves
;
the
rate
to
be
more
or
less
,
accord
to
the
degree
of
excel
;
the
decision
whereof
should
be
leave
entirely
to
their
own
breast
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
high
tax
be
upon
man
who
be
the
great
favourite
of
the
other
sex
,
and
the
assessment
,
accord
to
the
number
and
nature
of
the
favour
they
have
receive
;
for
which
,
they
be
allow
to
be
their
own
voucher
.
<EOS>
Wit
,
valour
,
and
politeness
,
be
likewise
propose
to
be
largely
tax
,
and
collect
in
the
same
manner
,
by
every
person
's
give
his
own
word
for
the
quantum
of
what
he
possess
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
to
honour
,
justice
,
wisdom
,
and
learning
,
they
should
not
be
tax
at
all
;
because
they
be
qualification
of
so
singular
a
kind
,
that
no
man
will
either
allow
them
in
his
neighbour
or
value
them
in
himself
.
  
<EOS>
the
woman
be
propose
to
be
tax
accord
to
their
beauty
and
skill
in
dressing
,
wherein
they
have
the
same
privilege
with
the
man
,
to
be
determine
by
their
own
judgment
.
 
<EOS>
but
constancy
,
chastity
,
good
sense
,
and
good
nature
,
be
not
rate
,
because
they
would
not
bear
the
charge
of
collect
.
  
<EOS>
to
keep
senator
in
the
interest
of
the
crown
,
it
be
propose
that
the
member
should
raffle
for
employment
;
every
man
first
take
an
oath
,
and
give
security
,
that
he
would
vote
for
the
court
,
whether
he
win
or
not
;
after
which
,
the
loser
have
,
in
their
turn
,
the
liberty
of
raffle
upon
the
next
vacancy
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
hope
and
expectation
would
be
keep
alive
;
none
would
complain
of
broken
promise
,
but
impute
their
disappointment
wholly
to
fortune
,
whose
shoulder
be
broad
and
strong
than
those
of
a
ministry
.
  
<EOS>
another
professor
show
me
a
large
paper
of
instruction
for
discover
plot
and
conspiracy
against
the
government
.
 
<EOS>
He
advise
great
statesman
to
examine
into
the
diet
of
all
suspect
person
;
their
time
of
eat
;
upon
which
side
they
lie
in
bed
;
with
which
hand
they
wipe
their
posterior
;
take
a
strict
view
of
their
excrement
,
and
,
from
the
colour
,
the
odour
,
the
taste
,
the
consistence
,
the
crudeness
or
maturity
of
digestion
,
form
a
judgment
of
their
thought
and
design
;
because
man
be
never
so
serious
,
thoughtful
,
and
intent
,
as
when
they
be
at
stool
,
which
he
find
by
frequent
experiment
;
for
,
in
such
conjuncture
,
when
he
use
,
merely
as
a
trial
,
to
consider
which
be
the
good
way
of
murder
the
king
,
his
ordure
would
have
a
tincture
of
green
;
but
quite
different
,
when
he
think
only
of
raise
an
insurrection
,
or
burn
the
metropolis
.
  
<EOS>
the
whole
discourse
be
write
with
great
acuteness
,
contain
many
observation
,
both
curious
and
useful
for
politician
;
but
,
as
I
conceive
,
not
altogether
complete
.
 
<EOS>
this
I
venture
to
tell
the
author
,
and
offer
,
if
he
please
,
to
supply
him
with
some
addition
.
 
<EOS>
He
receive
my
proposition
with
more
compliance
than
be
usual
among
writer
,
especially
those
of
the
project
specie
,
professing
"
he
would
be
glad
to
receive
further
information
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
"
that
in
the
kingdom
of
Tribnia

by
the

when

they

two

more
effectual
,
which
the

call
acrostic

first

they

decipher

b

a

a

or
,
secondly
,
by
transpose
the
letter

they
can
lay
open
the
deep

<EOS>
so
,
for

if

I

reason

north

to
the
Pacific

be
not

a
hundred

fifty
mile
from
Lagado

where
there
be
a
good

and
much
commerce
with
the
great
island
of
Luggnagg

situate
to
the
north

west
about
29
degree

latitude

<EOS>
this
island

Luggnagg
stand
south

eastward
of

about

hundred
league

<EOS>
there
be

japanese
emperor

the
king
of
Luggnagg
;
which
afford
frequent
opportunity
of
sailing
from
one
island
to
the

<EOS>
I
determine
therefore
to
direct
my
course
this
way
,
in
order
to
my
return
to
Europe
.
 
<EOS>
I
hire
two
mule

with
a

the

show

<EOS>
My

be
without

<EOS>
when
I

(
for
so
it
be
call
)
there
be
no
ship
in
the
harbour
bind

Luggnagg

nor
likely
to
be

<EOS>
the

about
as

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
a

Luggnagg
could
not

in
less
than
a

it
may
be
no
disagreeable
amusement
for
me
to
take
a

to
the
little

about
five
league
off

<EOS>
He
offer
himself
and
a
friend
to
accompany
me
,
and
that
I
should
be
provide
with
a
small
convenient
bark
for
the
voyage
.
  
<EOS>
Glubbdubdrib
,
as
nearly
as
I
can
interpret
the
word
,
signify
the
island
of
sorcerer
or
magician
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
about
one
third
as
large
as
the
Isle
of
Wight
,
and
extremely
fruitful
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
govern
by
the

a
certain
tribe

all
magician

<EOS>
this
tribe

the
eld
in
succession

prince
or
governor

<EOS>
He
have
a
noble
palace
,
and
a
park
of
about
three
thousand
acre
,
surround
by
a
wall
of
hewn
stone
twenty
foot
high
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
park
be
several
small
enclosure
for
cattle
,
corn
,
and
gardening
.
  
<EOS>
the
governor
and
his
family
be
serve
and
attend
by
domestic
of
a
kind
somewhat
unusual
.
 
<EOS>
by
his
skill
in
necromancy
he
have
a
power
of
call
whom
he
please
from
the
dead
,
and
command
their
service
for
twenty
-
four
hour
,
but
no
longer
;
nor
can
he
call
the
same
person
up
again
in
less
than
three
month
,
except
upon
very
extraordinary
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
arrive
at
the
island
,
which
be
about
eleven
in
the
morning
,
one
of
the
gentleman
who
accompany
me
go
to
the
governor
,
and
desire
admittance
for
a
stranger
,
who
come
on
purpose
to
have
the
honour
of
attend
on
his
highness
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
immediately
grant
,
and
we
all
three
enter
the
gate
of
the
palace
between
two
row
of
guard
,
armed
and
dress
after
a
very
antic
manner
,
and
with
something
in
their
countenance
that
make
my
flesh
creep
with
a
horror
I
can
not
express
.
 
<EOS>
We
pass
through
several
apartment
,
between
servant
of
the
same
sort
,
rank
on
each
side
as
before
,
till
we
come
to
the
chamber
of
presence
;
where
,
after
three
profound
obeisance
,
and
a
few
general
question
,
we
be
permit
to
sit
on
three
stool
,
near
the
low
step
of
his
highness
's
throne
.
 
<EOS>
He
understand
the
language
of
Balnibarbi
,
although
it
be
different
from
that
of
this
island
.
<EOS>
He
desire
me
to
give
him
some
account
of
my
travel
;
and
,
to
let
me
see
that
I
should
be
treat
without
ceremony
,
he
dismiss
all
his
attendant
with
a
turn
of
his
finger
;
at
which
,
to
my
great
astonishment
,
they
vanish
in
an
instant
,
like
vision
in
a
dream
when
we
awake
on
a
sudden
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
recover
myself
in
some
time
,
till
the
governor
assure
me
,
"
that
I
should
receive
no
hurt
:
"
and
observe
my
two
companion
to
be
under
no
concern
,
who
have
be
often
entertain
in
the
same
manner
<EOS>
,
I
begin
to
take
courage
,
and
relate
to
his
highness
a
short
history
of
my
several
adventure
;
yet
not
without
some
hesitation
,
and
frequently
look
behind
me
to
the
place
where
I
have
see
those
domestic
spectre
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
the
honour
to
dine
with
the
governor
,
where
a
new
set
of
ghost
serve
up
the
meat
,
and
wait
at
table
.
 
<EOS>
I
now
observe
myself
to
be
less
terrified
than
I
have
be
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
stay
till
sunset
,
but
humbly
desire
his
highness
to
excuse
me
for
not
accept
his
invitation
of
lodge
in
the
palace
.
 
<EOS>
My
two
friend
and
<EOS>
I
lie
at
a
private
house
in
the
town
adjoining
,
which
be
the
capital
of
this
little
island
;
and
the
next
morning
we
return
to
pay
our
duty
to
the
governor
,
as
he
be
pleased
to
command
us
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
manner
we
continue
in
the
island
for
ten
day
,
most
part
of
every
day
with
the
governor
,
and
at
night
in
our
lodging
.
<EOS>
I
soon
grow
so
familiarized
to
the
sight
of
spirit
,
that
after
the
third
or
fourth
time
they
give
me
no
emotion
at
all
:
 
or
,
if
I
have
any
apprehension
leave
,
my
curiosity
prevail
over
them
.
 
<EOS>
for
his
highness
the
governor
order
me
"
to
call
up
whatever
person
I
would
choose
to
name
,
and
in
whatever
number
,
among
all
the
dead
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
to
the
present
time
,
and
command
them
to
answer
any
question
I
should
think
fit
to
ask
;
with
this
condition
,
that
my
question
must
be
confine
within
the
compass
of
the
time
they
live
in
.
 
<EOS>
and
one
thing
I
may
depend
upon
,
that
they
would
certainly
tell
me
the
truth
,
for
lying
be
a
talent
of
no
use
in
the
low
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
make
my
humble
acknowledgment
to
his
highness
for
so
great
a
favour
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
in
a
chamber
,
<EOS>
from
whence
there
be
a
fair
prospect
into
the
park
.
 
<EOS>
and
because
my
first
inclination
be
to
be
entertain
with
scene
of
pomp
and
magnificence
,
I
desire
to
see
Alexander
the
Great
at
the
head
of
his
army
,
just
after
the
battle
of
Arbela
:
 
which
,
upon
a
motion
of
the
governor
's
finger
,
immediately
appear
in
a
large
field
,
under
the
window
where
we
stand
.
 
<EOS>
Alexander
be
call
up
into
the
room
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
with
great
difficulty
that
I
understand
his
Greek
,
and
have
but
little
of
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
He
assure
me
upon
his
honour
"
that
he
be
not
poison
,
but
die
of
a
bad
fever
by
excessive
drinking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
next
,
I
see
Hannibal
pass
the
Alps
,
who
tell
me
"
he
have
not
a
drop
of
vinegar
in
his
camp
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
see
Caesar
and
Pompey
at
the
head
of
their
troop
,
just
ready
to
engage
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
former
,
in
his
last
great
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
I
desire
that
the
senate
of
Rome
may
appear
before
me
,
in
one
large
chamber
,
and
an
assembly
of
somewhat
a
later
age
in
counterview
,
in
another
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
seem
to
be
an
assembly
of
hero
and
demigod
;
the
other
,
a
knot
of
pedlar
,
pick
-
pocket
,
highwayman
,
and
bully
.
  
<EOS>
the
governor
,
at
my
request
,
give
the
sign
for
Caesar
and
Brutus
to
advance
towards
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
strike
with
a
profound
veneration
at
the
sight
of
Brutus
,
and
could
easily
discover
the
most
consummate
virtue
,
the
great
intrepidity
and
firmness
of
mind
,
the
true
love
of
his
country
,
and
general
benevolence
for
mankind
,
in
every
lineament
of
his
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
I
observe
,
with
much
pleasure
,
that
these
two
person
be
in
good
intelligence
with
each
other
;
and
Caesar
freely
confess
to
me
,
"
that
the
great
action
of
his
own
life
be
not
equal
,
by
many
degree
,
to
the
glory
of
take
it
away
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
have
the
honour
to
have
much
conversation
with
Brutus
;
and
be
tell
,
"
that
his
ancestor
Junius
,
Socrates
,
Epaminondas
,
Cato
<EOS>
the
young
,
Sir
Thomas
More
,
and
himself
be
perpetually
together
:
"
a
sextumvirate
,
to
which
all
the
age
of
the
world
can
not
add
a
seventh
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
tedious
to
trouble
the
reader
with
relate
what
vast
number
of
illustrious
person
be
call
up
to
gratify
that
insatiable
desire
I
have
to
see
the
world
in
every
period
of
antiquity
place
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
chiefly
feed
mine
eye
with
behold
the
destroyer
of
tyrant
and
usurper
,
and
the
restorer
of
liberty
to
oppress
and
injure
nation
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
impossible
to
express
the
satisfaction
I
receive
in
my
own
mind
,
after
such
a
manner
as
to
make
it
a
suitable
entertainment
to
the
reader
.
   
<EOS>
a
further
account
of
Glubbdubdrib
.
 
<EOS>
ancient
and
modern
history
correct
.
 
<EOS>
have
a
desire
to
see
those
ancient
who
be
most
renowned
for
wit
and
learning
,
I
set
apart
one
day
on
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
I
propose
that
Homer
and
Aristotle
may
appear
at
the
head
of
all
their
commentator
;
but
these
be
so
numerous
,
that
some
hundred
be
force
to
attend
in
the
court
,
and
outward
room
of
the
palace
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
,
and
could
distinguish
those
two
hero
,
at
first
sight
,
not
only
from
the
crowd
,
but
from
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
Homer
be
the
tall
and
comelier
person
of
the
two
,
walk
very
erect
for
one
of
his
age
,
and
his
eye
be
the
most
quick
and
pierce
I
ever
beheld
.
<EOS>
Aristotle
stoop
much
,
and
make
use
of
a
staff
.
 
<EOS>
His
visage
be
meagre
,
his
hair
lank
and
thin
,
and
his
voice
hollow
.
 
<EOS>
I
soon
discover
that
both
of
them
be
perfect
stranger
to
the
rest
of
the
company
,
and
have
never
see
or
hear
of
them
before
;
and
I
have
a
whisper
from
a
ghost
who
shall
be
nameless
,
"
that
these
commentator
always
keep
in
the
most
distant
quarter
from
their
principal
,
in
the
low
world
,
through
a
consciousness
of
shame
and
guilt
,
because
they
have
so
horribly
misrepresent
the
meaning
of
those
author
to
posterity
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
introduce
Didymus
and
Eustathius
to
Homer
,
and
prevail
on
him
to
treat
them
better
than
perhaps
they
deserve
,
for
he
soon
find
they
want
a
genius
to
enter

the

<EOS>
but
Aristotle
be
out
of
all
patience
with
the
account
I
give
him
of
Scotus
and
Ramus
,
as
I
present
them
to
him
;
and
he
ask
them
,
"
whether
the
rest
of
the
tribe
be
as
great
dunce
as
themselves
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
then
desire
the
governor
to
call
up
Descartes
and
Gassendi
,
with
whom
I
prevail
to
explain
their
system
to
Aristotle
.
 
<EOS>
this
great
philosopher
freely
acknowledge
his
own
mistake
in
natural
philosophy
,
because
he
proceed
in
many
thing
upon
conjecture
,
as
all
man
must
do
;
and
he
find
that
Gassendi
,
who
have
make
the
doctrine
of
Epicurus
as
palatable
as
he
could
,
and
the
vortex
of
Descartes
,
be
equally
to
be
explode
.
 
<EOS>
He
predict
the
same
fate
to
ATTRACTION
,
whereof
the
present
learn
be
such
zealous
asserter
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
that
new
system
of
nature
be
but
new
fashion
,
which
would
vary
in
every
age
;
and
even
those
,
who
pretend
to
demonstrate
them
from
mathematical
principle

would
flourish

a
short
period
of

be
out

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
spend
five
day
in
converse
with
many
other
of
the
ancient
learn
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
most
of
the
first
roman
emperor
.
 
<EOS>
I
prevail
on
the
governor
to
call
up
Heliogabalus
's
cook
to
dress
us
a
dinner
,
but
they
could
not
show
us
much
of
their
skill
,
for
want
of
material
.
 
<EOS>
a
helot
of
Agesilaus
make
us
a
dish
of
spartan
broth
,
but
I
be
not
able
to
get
down
a
second
spoonful
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
gentleman
,
who
conduct
me
to
the
island
,
be
press
by
their
private
affair
to
return
in
three
day
,
which
I
employ
in
see
some
of
the
modern
dead
,
who
have
make
the
great
figure
,
for
two
or
three
hundred
year
past
,
in
our
own
and
other
country
of
Europe
;
and
have
be
always
a
great
admirer
of
old
illustrious
family
,
I
desire
the
governor
would
call
up
a
dozen
or
two
of
king
,
with
their
ancestor
in
order
for
eight
or
nine
generation
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
disappointment
be
grievous
and
unexpected
.
<EOS>
for
,
instead
of
a
long
train
with
royal
diadem
,
I
see
in
one
family
two
fiddler
,
three
spruce
courtier
,
and
an
italian
prelate
.
 
<EOS>
in
another
,
a
barber
,
an
abbot
,
and
two
cardinal
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
too
great
a
veneration
for
crown
head
,
to
dwell
any
longer
on
so
nice
a
subject
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
to
count
,
marquise
,
duke
,
earls
,
and
the
like
,
I
be
not
so
scrupulous
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
confess
,
it
be
not
without
some
pleasure
,
that
I
find
myself
able
to
trace
the
particular
feature
,
by
which
certain
family
be
distinguish
,
up
to
their
original
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
plainly
discover
whence
<EOS>
one
family
derive
a
long
chin
;
why
a
second
have
abound
with
knave
for
two
generation
,
and
fool
for
two
more
;
why
a
third
happen
to
be
crack
-
brained
,
and
a
fourth
to
be
sharper
;
whence
<EOS>
it
come
,
what
Polydore
Virgil
say
of
a
certain
great
house
,
<EOS>
Nec
vir
fortis
,
nec
foemina
casta
;
how
cruelty
,
falsehood
,
and
cowardice
,
grow
to
be
characteristic
by
which
certain
family
be
distinguish
as
much
as
by
their
coat
of
arm
;
who
first
bring
the
pox
into
a
noble
house
,
which
have
lineally
descend
scrofulous
tumour
to
their
posterity
.
 
<EOS>
neither
<EOS>
could
I
wonder
at
all
this
,
when
I
see
such
an
interruption
of
lineage
,
by
page
,
lackey
,
valet
,
coachman
,
gamester
,
fiddler
,
player
,
captain
,
and
pickpocket
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
chiefly
disgust
with
modern
history
.
 
<EOS>
for
have
strictly
examine
all
the
person
of
great
name
in
the
court
of
prince
,
for
a
hundred
year
past
,
I
find
how
the
world
have
be
mislead
by
prostitute
writer
,
to
ascribe
the
great
exploit
in
war
,
to
coward
;
the
wise
counsel
,
to
fool
;
sincerity
,
to
flatterer
;
roman
virtue
,
to
betrayer
of
their
country
;
piety
,
to
atheist
;
chastity
,
to
sodomite
;
truth
,
to
informer
:
 
how
many
innocent
and
excellent
person
have
be
condemn
to
death
or
banishment
by
the
practising
of
great
minister
upon
the
corruption
of
judge
,
and
the
malice
of
faction
:
 
how
many
villain
have
be
exalt
to
the
high
place
of
trust
,
power
,
dignity
,
and
profit
:
 
<EOS>
how
great
a
share
in
the
motion
and
event
of
court
,
council
,
and
senate
may
be
challenge
by
bawd
,
whore
,
pimp
,
parasite
,
and
buffoon
.
 
<EOS>
how
low
an
opinion
I
have
of
human
wisdom
and
integrity
,
when
I
be
truly
inform
of
the
spring
and
motive
of
great
enterprise
and
revolution
in
the
world
,
and
of
the
contemptible
accident
to
which
they
owe
their
success
.
  
<EOS>
here
I
discover
the
roguery
and
ignorance
of
those
who
pretend
to
write
anecdote
,
or
secret
history
;
who
send
so
many
king
to
their
grave
with
a
cup
of
poison
;
will
repeat
the
discourse
between
a
prince
and
chief
minister
,
where
no
witness
be
by
;
unlock
the
thought
and
cabinet
of
ambassador
and
secretary
of
state
;
and
have
the
perpetual
misfortune
to
be
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
here
I
discover
the
true
cause
of
many
great
event
that
have
surprise
the
world
;
how
a
whore
can
govern
the
back
-
stair
,
the
back
-
stair
a
council
,
and
the
council
a
senate
.
 
<EOS>
a
general
confess
,
in
my
presence
,
"
that
he
get
a
victory
purely
by
the
force
of
cowardice
and
ill
conduct
;
"
and
an
admiral
,
"
that
,
for
want
of
proper
intelligence
,
he
beat
the
enemy
,
to
whom
he
intend
to
betray
the
fleet
.
"
 
<EOS>
three
king
protest
to
me
,
"
that
in
their
whole
reign
they
never
do
once
prefer
any
person
of
merit
,
unless
by
mistake
,
or
treachery
of
some
minister
in
whom
they
confide
;
neither
would
they
do
it
if
they
be
to
live
again
:
"
and
they
show
,
with
great
strength
of
reason
,
"
that
the
royal
throne
could
not
be
support
without
corruption
,
because
that
positive
,
confident
,
restiff
temper
,
which
virtue
infuse
into
a
man
,
be
a
perpetual
clog
to
public
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
the
curiosity
to
inquire
in
a
particular
manner
,
by
what
method
<EOS>
great
number
have
procure
to
themselves
high
title
of
honour
,
and
prodigious
estate
;
and
I
confine
my
inquiry
to
a
very
modern
period
:
 
however
,
without
grate
upon
present
time
,
because
I
would
be
sure
to
give
no
offence
even
to
foreigner
<EOS>
(
for
I
hope
the
reader
nee
not
be
tell
,
that
I
do
not
in
the
least
intend
my
own
country
,
in
what
I
say
upon
this
occasion
,
)
<EOS>
a
great
number
of
person
concern
be
call
up
;
and
,
upon
a
very
slight
examination
,
discover
such
a
scene
of
infamy
,
that
I
can
not
reflect
upon
it
without
some
seriousness
.
 
<EOS>
Perjury
,
oppression
,
subornation
,
fraud
,
pandarism
,
and
the
like
infirmity
,
be
among
the
most
excusable
art
they
have
to
mention
;
and
for
these
I
give
,
as
it
be
reasonable
,
great
allowance
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
some
confess
they
owe
their
greatness
and
wealth
to
sodomy
,
or
incest
;
other
,
to
the
prostituting
of
their
own
wife
and
daughter
;
other
,
to
the
betraying
of
their
country
or
their
prince
;
some
,
to
poison
;
more
to
the
perverting
of
justice
,
in
order
to
destroy
the
innocent
<EOS>
,
I
hope
I
may
be
pardon
,
if
these
discovery
incline
me
a
little
to
abate
of
that
profound
veneration
,
which
I
be
naturally
apt
to
pay
to
person
of
high
rank
,
who
ought
to
be
treat
with
the
utmost
respect
due
to
their
sublime
dignity
,
by
us
their
inferior
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
often
read
of
some
great
service
do
to
prince
and
state
,
and
desire
to
see
the
person
by
whom
those
service
be
perform
.
 
<EOS>
upon
inquiry
I
be
tell
,
"
that
their
name
be
to
be
find
on
no
record
,
except
a
few
of
them
,
whom
history
have
represent
as
the
vilest
of
rogue
and
traitor
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
rest
,
I
have
never
once
hear
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
appear
with
deject
look
,
and
in
the
mean
habit
;
most
of
them
tell
me
,
"
they
die
in
poverty
and
disgrace
,
and
the
rest
on
a
scaffold
or
a
gibbet
.
"
  
<EOS>
among
other
,
there
be
one
person
,
whose
case
appear
a
little
singular
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
youth
about
eighteen
year
old
standing
by
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
"
he
have
for
many
year
be
commander
of
a
ship
;
and
in
the
sea
fight
at
Actium
have
the
good
fortune
to
break
through
the
enemy
's
great
line
of
battle
,
sink
three
of
their
capital
ship
,
and
take
a
fourth
,
which
be
the
sole
cause
of
Antony
's
flight
,
and
of
the
victory
that
ensue
;
that
the
youth
stand
by
him
,
his
only
son
,
be
kill
in
the
action
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
add
,
"
that
upon
the
confidence
of
some
merit
,
the
war
be
at
an
end
,
he
go
to
Rome
,
and
solicit
at
the
court
of
Augustus
to
be
prefer
to
a
great
ship
,
whose
commander
have
be
kill
;
but
,
without
any
regard
to
his
pretension
,
it
be
give
to
a
boy
who
have
never
see
the
sea
,
the
son
of
Libertina
,
who
wait
on
one
of
the
emperor
's
mistress
.
 
<EOS>
return
back
to
his
own
vessel
,
he
be
charge
with
neglect
of
duty
,
and
the
ship
give
to
a
favourite
page
of
Publicola
,
the
vice
-
admiral
;
whereupon
he
retire
to
a
poor
farm
at
a
great
distance
from
Rome
,
and
there
end
his
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
curious
to
know
the
truth
of
this
story
,
that
I
desire
Agrippa
may
be
call
,
<EOS>
who
be
admiral
in
that
fight
.
 
<EOS>
He
appear
,
and
confirm
the
whole
account
:
 
<EOS>
but
with
much
more
advantage
to
the
captain
,
whose
modesty
have
extenuate
or
conceal
a
great
part
of
his
merit
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
to
find
corruption
grow
so
high
and
so
quick
in
that
empire
,
by
the
force
of
luxury
so
lately
introduce
;
which
make
me
less
wonder
at
many
parallel
case
in
other
country
,
where
vice
of
all
kind
have
reign
so
much
longer
,
and
where
the
whole
praise
,
as
well
as
pillage
,
have
be
engross
by
the
chief
commander
,
who
perhaps
have
the
least
title
to
either
.
  
<EOS>
as
every
person
call
up
make
exactly
the
same
appearance
he
have
do
in
the
world
,
it
give
me
melancholy
reflection
to
observe
how
much
the
race
of
human
kind
be
degenerate
among
us
within
these
hundred
year
past
;
how
the
pox
,
under
all
its
consequence
and
denomination
have
alter
every
lineament
of
an
english
countenance
;
shorten
the
size
of
body
,
unbrace
the
nerve
,
relax
the
sinew
and
muscle
,
introduce
a
sallow
complexion
,
and
render
the
flesh
loose
and
rancid
.
  
<EOS>
I
descend
so
low
,
as
to
desire
some
english
yeoman
of
the
old
stamp
may
be
summon
to
appear
;
once
so
famous
for
the
simplicity
of
their
manner
,
diet
,
and
dress
;
for
justice
in
their
dealing
;
for
their
true
spirit
of
liberty
;
for
their
valour
,
and
love
of
their
country

<EOS>
neither
could
I
be
wholly
unmoved
,
after
compare
the
living
with
the
dead
,
when
I
consider
how
all
these
pure
native
virtue
be
prostitute
for
a
piece
of
money
by
their
grand

who
,
in

acquire
every
vice

corruption

can
possibly
be

the

to
Maldonada

,
after
a
fortnight
's
waiting

a

the

some

be
so
generous
and
kind
as
to
furnish
me
with
provision
,
and
see
me
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
month
in
this
voyage
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
one
violent
storm
,
and
be
under
a
necessity
of
steer
westward
to
get
into
the
trade
wind
,
which
hold
for
above
sixty
league
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
21st
of
April
,
1708
,
we
sail
into
the
river
of
Clumegnig
,
which
be
a
seaport
town
,
at
the
south
-
east
point
of
Luggnagg
.
 
<EOS>
We
cast
anchor
within
a
league
of
the
town
,
and
make
a
signal
for
a
pilot
.
 
<EOS>
two
of
them
come
on
board
in
less
than
half
an
hour
,
by
whom
we
be
guide
between
certain
shoal
and
rock
,
which
be
very
dangerous
in
the
passage
,
to
a
large
basin
,
where
a
fleet
may
ride
in
safety
within
a
cable
's
length
of
the
town
-
wall
.
  
<EOS>
some
of
our
sailor
,
whether
out
of
treachery
or
inadvertence
,
have
inform
the
pilot
"
that
I
be
a
stranger
,
and
great
traveller
;
"
whereof
these
give
notice
to
a
custom
-
house
officer
,
by
whom
I
be
examine
very
strictly
upon
my
landing
.
 
<EOS>
this
officer
speak
to
me
in
the
language
of
Balnibarbi
,
which
,
by
the
force
of
much
commerce
,
be
generally
understand
in
that
town
,
especially
by
seaman
and
those
employ
in
the
custom
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
him
a
short
account
of
some
particular
,
and
make
my
story
as
plausible
and
consistent
as
I
could
;
but
I
think
it
necessary
to
disguise
my
country
,
and
call
myself
a
Hollander
;
because
my
intention
be
for
Japan
,
and
I
know
the
Dutch
be
the
only
Europeans
permit
to
enter
into
that
kingdom

I
therefore
tell
the
officer
,
"
that
have
be
shipwreck
on
the
coast
of
Balnibarbi
,
and
cast
on
a
rock
,
I
be
receive
up
into
Laputa
,
or
the
fly
island
(
of
which
he
have
often
hear
)
,
and
be
now
endeavour
to
get
to
Japan
,
whence
<EOS>
I
may
find
a
convenience
of
return
to
my
own
country
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
officer
say
,
"
I
must
be
confine
till
he
could
receive
order
from
court
,
for
which
he
would
write
immediately
,
and
hope
to
receive
an
answer
in
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
carry
to
a
convenient
lodging
with
a
sentry
place
at
the
door
;
however
,
I
have
the
liberty
of
a
large
garden
,
and
be
treat
with
humanity
enough
,
be
maintain
all
the
time
at
the
king
's
charge
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
invite
by
several
person
,
chiefly
out
of
curiosity
,
because
it
be
report
that
I
come
from
country
very
remote
,
of
which
they
have
never
hear
.
  
<EOS>
I
hire
a
young
man
,
who
come
in
the
same
ship
,
to
be
an
interpreter
;
he
be
a
native
of
Luggnagg
,
but
have
live
some
year
at
Maldonada
,
and
be
a
perfect
master
of
both
language
.
 
<EOS>
by
his
assistance
,
I
be
able
to
hold
a
conversation
with
those
who
come
to
visit
me
;
but
this
consist
only
of
their
question
,
and
my
answer
.
  
<EOS>
the
despatch
come
from
court
about
the
time
we
expect
.
 
<EOS>
It
contain
a
warrant
for
conduct
me
and
my
retinue
to
Traldragdubh
,
or
Trildrogdrib
<EOS>
(
for
it
be
pronounce
both
way
as
near
as
I
can
remember
)
,
by
a
party
of
ten
horse
.
 
<EOS>
all
my
retinue
be
that
poor
lad
for
an
interpreter
,
whom
I
persuade
into
my
service
,
and
,
at
my
humble
request
,
we
have
each
of
us
a
mule
to
ride
on
.
 
<EOS>
a
messenger
be
despatch
half
a
day
's
journey
before
us
,
to
give
the
king
notice
of
my
approach
,
and
to
desire
,
"
that
his
majesty
would
please
to
appoint
a
day
and
hour
,
when
it
would
by
his
gracious
pleasure
that
I
may
have
the
honour
to
lick
the
dust
before
his
footstool
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
court
style
,
and
I
find
it
to
be
more
than
matter
of
form
:
 
for
,
upon
my
admittance
two
day
after
my
arrival
,
I
be
command
to
crawl
upon
my
belly
,
and
lick
the
floor
as
I
advance
;
but
,
on
account
of
my
be
a
stranger
,
care
be
take
to
have
it
make
so
clean
,
that
the
dust
be
not
offensive
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
this
be
a
peculiar
grace
,
not
allow
to
any
but
person
of
the
high
rank
,
when
they
desire
an
admittance
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
sometimes
the
floor
be
strew
with
dust
on
purpose
,
when
the
person
to
be
admit
happen
to
have
powerful
enemy
at
court
;
and
I
have
see
a
great
lord
with
his
mouth
so
cram
,
that
when
he
have
creep
to
the
proper
distance
from
the
throne
;
he
be
not
able
to
speak
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
neither
be
there
any
remedy
;
because
it
be
capital
for
those
,
who
receive
an
audience
to
spit
or
wipe
their
mouth
in
his
majesty
's
presence
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
indeed
another
custom
,
which
I
can
not
altogether
approve
of
:
 
when
the
king
have
a
mind
to
put
any
of
his
noble
to
death
in
a
gentle
indulgent
manner
,
he
command
the
floor
to
be
strew
with
a
certain
brown
powder
of
a
deadly
composition
,
which
be
lick
up
,
infallibly
kill
him
in
twenty
-
four
hour
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
justice
to
this
prince
's
great
clemency
,
and
the
care
he
have
of
his
subject
'
life
(
wherein
it
be
much
to
be
wish
that
the
Monarchs
of
Europe
would
imitate
him
)
,
it
must
be
mention
for
his
honour
,
that
strict
order
be
give
to
have
the
infected
part
of
the
floor
well
wash
after
every
such
execution
,
which
,
if
his
domestic
neglect
,
they
be
in
danger
of
incur
his
royal
displeasure
.
 
<EOS>
I
myself
hear
him
give
direction
,
that
one
of
his
page
should
be
whip
,
whose
turn
it
be
to
give
notice
about
wash
the
floor
after
an
execution
,
but
maliciously
have
omit
it
;
by
which
neglect
a
young
lord
of
great
hope
,
come
to
an
audience
,
be
unfortunately
poison
,
although
the
king
at
that
time
have
no
design
against
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
good
prince
be
so
gracious
as
to
forgive
the
poor
page
his
whipping
,
upon
promise
that
he
would
do
so
no
more
,
without
special
order
.
  
<EOS>
to
return
from
this
digression
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
creep
within
four
yard
of
the
throne
,
I
raise
myself
gently
upon
my
knee
,
and
then
strike
my
forehead
seven
time
against
the
ground
,
I
pronounce
the
follow
word
,
as
they
have
be
teach
me
the
night
before

this

the
compliment
,
establish
by
the
law
of
the
land
,
for
all
person
admit
to
the
king
's
presence
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
render
into
English
thus
:
 
"
May
your
celestial
majesty
outlive
the
sun
,
eleven
moon
and
a
half

"
<EOS>
to
this
the
king
return
some
answer
,
which
,
although
I
could
not
understand
,
yet
I
reply
as
I
have
be
direct
:
 
Fluft
drin
yalerick
dwuldom
prastrad

,
which
properly
signify
,
"
My
tongue
be
in
the
mouth
of
my
friend
;
"
and
by
this
expression
be
mean
,
that
I
desire
leave
to
bring
my
interpreter
;
whereupon
the
young
man
already
mention
be
accordingly
introduce
,
by
whose
intervention
I
answer
as
many
question
as
his
majesty
could
put
in
above
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
I
speak
in
the
balnibarbian
tongue
,
and
my
interpreter
deliver
my
meaning
in
that
of
Luggnagg
.
  
<EOS>
the
king
be
much
delighted
with
my
company
,
and
order
his
bliffmarklub
,
or
high
-
chamberlain
,
to
appoint
a
lodging
in
the
court
for
me
and
my
interpreter
;
with
a
daily
allowance
for
my
table
,
and
a
large
purse
of
gold
for
my
common
expense
.
  
<EOS>
I
staid
three
month
in
this
country
,
out
of
perfect
obedience
to
his
majesty
;
who
be
please
highly
to
favour
me
,
and
make
me
very
honourable
offer
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
think
it
more
consistent
with
prudence
and
justice
to
pass
the
remainder
of
my
day
with
my
wife
and
family
.
   
<EOS>
the
Luggnaggians
commend
.
 
<EOS>
a
particular
description
of
the
Struldbrugs
,
with
many
conversation
between
the
author
and
some
eminent
person
upon
that
subject
.
 
<EOS>
the
Luggnaggians
be
a
polite
and
generous
people
;
and
although
they
be
not
without
some
share
of
that
pride
which
be
peculiar
to
all
eastern
country
,
yet
they
show
themselves
courteous
to
stranger
,
especially
such
who
be
countenance
by
the
court
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
many
acquaintance
,
and
among
person
of
the
good
fashion
;
and
be
always
attend
by
my
interpreter
,
the
conversation
we
have
be
not
disagreeable
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
,
in
much
good
company
,
I
be
ask
by
a
person
of
quality
,
"
whether
I
have
see
any
of
their
struldbrug
,
or
immortal
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
I
have
not
;
"
and
desire
he
would
explain
to
me
"
what
he
mean
by
such
an
appellation
,
apply
to
a
mortal
creature
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
"
that
sometimes
,
though
very
rarely
,
a
child
happen
to
be
bear
in
a
family
,
with
a
red
circular
spot
in
the
forehead
,
directly
over
the
left
eyebrow
,
which
be
an
infallible
mark
that
it
should
never
die
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
spot
,
as
he
describe
it
,
"
be
about
the
compass
of
a
silver
threepence
,
but
in
the
course
of
time
grow
large
,
and
change
its
colour
;
for
at
twelve
year
old
it
become
green
,
so
continued
till
five
and
twenty
,
then
turn
to
a
deep
blue
:
 
at
five
and
forty
it
grow
coal
black
,
and
as
large
as
an
English
shilling
;
but
never
admit
any
further
alteration
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
these
birth
be
so
rare
,
that
he
do
not
believe
there
could
be
above
eleven
hundred
struldbrug
,
of
both
sex
,
in
the
whole
kingdom
;
of
which
he
compute
about
fifty
in
the
metropolis
,
and
,
among
the
rest
,
a
young
girl
bear
;
about
three
year
ago
:
that
these
production
be
not
peculiar
to
any
family
,
but
a
mere
effect
of
chance
;
and
the
child
of
the
struldbrug
themselves
be
equally
mortal
with
the
rest
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
freely
own
myself
to
have
be
strike
with
inexpressible
delight
,
upon
hear
this
account
:
 
and
the
person
who
give
it
me
happen
to
understand
the
balnibarbian
language
,
which
I
speak
very
well
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
forbear
break
out
into
expression
,
perhaps
a
little
too
extravagant
.
 
<EOS>
I
cry
out
,
as
in
a
rapture
,
<EOS>
"
happy
nation
,
where
every
child
hath
at
least
a
chance
for
be
immortal
!
 
<EOS>
happy
people
,
who
enjoy
so
many
live
example
of
ancient
virtue
,
and
have
master
ready
to
instruct
them
in
the
wisdom
of
all
former
age
!
<EOS>
but
happy
,
beyond
all
comparison
,
be
those
excellent
struldbrug
,
who
,
be
bear
exempt
from
that
universal
calamity
of
human
nature
,
have
their
mind
free
and
disengaged
,
without
the
weight
and
depression
of
spirit
cause
by
the
continual
apprehension
of
death
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
discover
my
admiration
that
I
have
not
observe
any
of
these
illustrious
person
at
court
;
the
black
spot
on
the
forehead
be
so
remarkable
a
distinction
,
that
I
could
not
have
easily
overlook
it
:
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
impossible
that
his
majesty
,
a
most
judicious
prince
,
should
not
provide
himself
with
a
good
number
of
such
wise
and
able
counsellor
.
 
<EOS>
yet
perhaps
the
virtue
of
those
reverend
sage
be
too
strict
for
the
corrupt
and
libertine
manner
of
a
court
:
 
<EOS>
and
we
often
find
by
experience
,
that
young
man
be
too
opinionated
and
volatile
to
be
guide
by
the
sober
dictate
of
their
senior
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
since
the
king
be
pleased
to
allow
me
access
to
his
royal
person
,
I
be
resolve
,
upon
the
very
first
occasion
,
to
deliver
my
opinion
to
him
on
this
matter
freely
and
at
large
,
by
the
help
of
my
interpreter
;
and
whether
he
would
please
to
take
my
advice
or
not
,
yet
in
one
thing
I
be
determine
,
that
his
majesty
have
frequently
offer
me
an
establishment
in
this
country
,
I
would
,
with
great
thankfulness
,
accept
the
favour
,
and
pass
my
life
here
in
the
conversation
of
those
superior
being
the
struldbrug
,
if
they
would
please
to
admit
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
gentleman
to
whom
I
address
my
discourse
,
because
(
as
I
have
already
observe
)
<EOS>
he
speak
the
language
of
Balnibarbi
,
say
to
me
,
with
a
sort
of
a
smile
which
usually
arise
from
pity
to
the
ignorant
,
"
that
he
be
glad
of
any
occasion
to
keep
me
among
them
,
and
desire
my
permission
to
explain
to
the
company
what
I
have
speak
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
do
so
,
and
they
talk
together
for
some
time
in
their
own
language
,
whereof
I
understand
not
a
syllable
,
neither
could
I
observe
by
their
countenance
,
what
impression
my
discourse
have
make
on
them
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
short
silence
,
the
same
person
tell
me
,
"
that
his
friend
and
mine
(
so
he
think
fit
to
express
himself
)
be
very
much
pleased
with
the
judicious
remark
I
have
make
on
the
great
happiness
and
advantage
of
immortal
life
,
and
they
be
desirous
to
know
,
in
a
particular
manner
,
what
scheme
of
live
<EOS>
I
should
have
form
to
myself
,
if
it
have
fall
to
my
lot
to
have
be
bear
a
struldbrug
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
answer
,
"
it
be
easy
to
be
eloquent
on
so
copious
and
delightful
a
subject
,
especially
to
me
,
who
have
be
often
apt
to
amuse
myself
with
vision
of
what
I
should
do
,
if
I
be
a
king
,
a
general
,
or
a
great
lord
:
 
and
upon
this
very
case
,
I
have
frequently
run
over
the
whole
system
how
I
should
employ
myself
,
and
pass
the
time
,
if
I
be
sure
to
live
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
,
if
it
have
be
my
good
fortune
to
come
into
the
world
a
struldbrug
,
as
soon
as
I
could
discover
my
own
happiness
,
by
understand
the
difference
between
life
and
death
,
I
would
first
resolve
,
by
all
art
and
method
,
whatsoever
,
to
procure
myself
riches
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
pursuit
of
which
,
by
thrift
and
management
,
I
may
reasonably
expect
,
in
about
two
hundred
year
,
to
be
the
wealthy
man
in
the
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
second
place
,
I
would
,
from
my
early
youth
,
apply
myself
to
the
study
of
art
and
science
,
by
which
I
should
arrive
in
time
to
excel
all
other
in
learning
.
 
<EOS>
lastly
,
I
would
carefully
record
every
action
and
event
of
consequence
,
that
happen
in
the
public
,
impartially
draw
the
character
of
the
several
succession
of
prince
and
great
minister
of
state
,
with
my
own
observation
on
every
point

<EOS>
I
would
exactly
set
down
the
several
change
in
custom
,
language
,
fashion
of
dress
,
diet
,
and
diversion
.
 
<EOS>
by
all
which
acquirement
,
I
should
be
a
live
treasure
of
knowledge
and
wisdom
,
and
certainly
become
the
oracle
of
the
nation

<EOS>
"
I
would
never
marry
after
threescore
,
but
live
in
a
hospitable
manner
,
yet
still
on
the
saving
side
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
entertain
myself
in
form
and
direct
the
mind
of
hopeful
young
man

by
convince
them

from
my
own

fortify

numerous
example

the
usefulness

virtue

my
choice
and
constant
companion
should
be
a
set
of
my
own
immortal
brotherhood

among
whom

I
would
elect
a
dozen
from
the
most
ancient

down
to
my

where
any

I
would

convenient
lodge
round
my

have
some
of
them
always
at
my
table

only
mingle
a
few
of
the
most
valuable
among
you
mortal
,
whom
length
of
time
would
harden
me
to
lose
with
little
or
no
reluctance
,
and
treat
your
posterity
after
the

manner
;
just
as
a

divert
himself
with
the
annual
succession
of
pink
and
tulip
in
his
garden

without
regret
the
loss
of
those
which
wither

<EOS>
"
these
struldbrug
and
I
would
mutually
communicate
our
observation
and
memorial
,
through
the
course
of
time
;
remark
the
several
gradation
by
which
corruption
steal
into
the
world
,
and
oppose
it
in
every
step
,
by
give
perpetual
warning
and
instruction
to
mankind
;
which
,
add
to
the
strong
influence
of
our
own
example
,
would
probably
prevent
that
continual
degeneracy
of
human
nature
so
justly
complain
of
in
all
age
.
  
<EOS>
"
add
to
this
,
the
pleasure
of
see
the
various
revolution
of
state
and
empire
;
the
change
in
the
low
and
upper
world
;
ancient
city
in
ruin
,
and
obscure
village
become
the
seat
of
king
;
famous
river
lessen
into
shallow
brooks
;
the
ocean
leave
one
coast
dry
,
and
overwhelm
another
;
the
discovery
of
many
country
yet
unknown
;
barbarity
overrun
the
politest
nation
,
and
the
most
barbarous
become
civilized
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
then
see
the
discovery
of
the
longitude
,
the
perpetual
motion
,
the
universal
medicine
,
and
many
other
great
invention
,
bring
to
the
utmost
perfection
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
wonderful
discovery
should
we
make
in
astronomy
,
by
outlive
and
confirm
our
own
prediction
;
by
observe
the
progress
and
return
of
comet
,
with
the
change
of
motion
in
the
sun
,
moon
,
and
star
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
enlarge
upon
many
other
topic
,
which
the
natural
desire
of
endless
life
,
and
sublunary
happiness
,
could
easily
furnish
me
with
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
end
,
and
the
sum
of
my
discourse
have
be
interpret
,
as
before
,
to
the
rest
of
the
company
,
there
be
a
good
deal
of
talk
among
them
in
the
language
of
the
country
,
not
without
some
laughter
at
my
expense
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
the
same
gentleman
who
have
be
my
interpreter
,
say
,
"
he
be
desire
by
the
rest
to
set
me
right
in
a
few
mistake
,
which
I
have
fall
into
through
the
common
imbecility
of
human
nature
,
and
upon
that
allowance
be
less
answerable
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
that
this
breed
of
struldbrug
be
peculiar
to
their
country
,
for
there
be
no
such
people
either
in
Balnibarbi
or
Japan
,
where
he
have
the
honour
to
be
ambassador
from
his
majesty
,
and
find
the
native
in
both
those
kingdom
very
hard
to
believe
that
the
fact
be
possible
:
 
and
it
appear
from
my
astonishment
when
he
first
mention
the
matter
to
me
,
that
I
receive
it
as
a
thing
wholly
new
,
and
scarcely
to
be
credit
.
<EOS>
that
in
the
two
kingdom
above
mention
,
where
,
during
his
residence
,
he
have
converse
very
much
,
he
observe
long
life
to
be
the
universal
desire
and
wish
of
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
that
whoever
have
one
foot
in
the
grave
be
sure
to
hold
back
the
other
as
strongly
as
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
that
the
old
have
still
hope
of
live
one
day
longer
,
and
look
on
death
as
the
great
evil
,
from
which
nature
always
prompt
him
to
retreat
.
 
<EOS>
only
in
this
island
of
Luggnagg
the
appetite
for
living
be
not
so
eager
,
from
the
continual
example
of
the
struldbrug
before
their
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
the
system
of
living
contrive
by
me
,
be
unreasonable
and
unjust
;
because
it
suppose
a
perpetuity
of
youth
,
health
,
and
vigour
,
which
no
man
could
be
so
foolish
to
hope
,
however
extravagant
he
may
be
in
his
wish
.
 
<EOS>
that
the
question
therefore
be
not
,
whether
a
man
would
choose
to
be
always
in
the
prime
of
youth
,
attend
with
prosperity
and
health
;
but
how
he
would
pass
a
perpetual
life
under
all
the
usual
disadvantage
which
old
age
bring
along
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
for
although
few
man
will
avow
their
desire
of
be
immortal
,
upon
such
hard
condition
,
yet
in
the
two
kingdom
before
mention
,
of
Balnibarbi
and
Japan
,
he
observe
that
every
man
desire
to
put
off
death
some
time
longer
,
let
it
approach
ever
so
late
:
 
and
he
rarely
hear
of
any
man
who
die
willingly
,
except
he
be
incite
by
the
extremity
of
grief
or
torture
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
appeal
to
me
,
whether
in
those
country
I
have
travel
,
as
well
as
my
own
,
I
have
not
observe
the
same
general
disposition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
this
preface
,
he
give
me
a
particular
account
of
the
struldbrug
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
they
commonly
act
like
mortal
till
about
thirty
year
old
;
after
which
,
by
degree
,
they
grow
melancholy
and
deject
,
increase
in
both
till
they
come
to
fourscore
.
 
<EOS>
this
he
learn
from
their
own
confession
:
 
for
otherwise
,
there
not
be
above
two
or
three
of
that
specie
bear
in
an
age
,
they
be
too
few
to
form
a
general
observation
by
.
<EOS>
when
they
come
to
fourscore
year
,
which
be
reckon
the
extremity
of
live
in
this
country
,
they
have
not
only
all
the
folly
and
infirmity
of
other
old
man
,
but
many
more
which
arise
from
the
dreadful
prospect
of
never
die
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
not
only
opinionative
,
peevish
,
covetous
,
morose
,
vain
,
talkative
,
but
incapable
of
friendship
,
and
dead
to
all
natural
affection
,
which
never
descend
below
their
grandchild
.
 
<EOS>
Envy
and
impotent
desire
be
their
prevail
passion
.
 
<EOS>
but
those
object
against
which
their
envy
seem
principally
direct
,
be
the
vice
of
the
young
sort
and
the
death
of
the
old
.
 
<EOS>
by
reflect
on
the
former
,
they
find
themselves
cut
off
from
all
possibility
of
pleasure
;
and
whenever
they
see
a
funeral
,
they
lament
and
repine
that
other
have
go
to
a
harbour
of
rest
to
which
they
themselves
never
can
hope
to
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
no
remembrance
of
anything
<EOS>
but
what
they
learn
and
observe
in
their
youth
and
middle
-
age
,
and
even
that
be
very
imperfect
;
and
for
the
truth
or
particular
of
any
fact
,
it
be
safe
to
depend
on
common
tradition
,
than
upon
their
good
recollection
.
 
<EOS>
the
least
miserable
among
them
appear
to
be
those
who
turn
to
dotage
,
and
entirely
lose
their
memory
;
these
meet
with
more
pity
and
assistance
,
because
they
want
many
bad
quality
which
abound
in
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
a
struldbrug
happen
to
marry
one
of
his
own
kind
,
the
marriage
be
dissolve
of
course
,
by
the
courtesy
of
the
kingdom
,
as
soon
as
the
young
of
the
two
come
to
be
fourscore
;
for
the
law
think
it
a
reasonable
indulgence
,
that
those
who
be
condemn
,
without
any
fault
of
their
own
,
to
a
perpetual
continuance
in
the
world
,
should
not
have
their
misery
double
by
the
load
of
a
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
soon
as
they
have
complete
the
term
of
eighty
year
,
they
be
look
on
as
dead
in
law
;
their
heir
immediately
succeed
to
their
estate
;
only
a
small
pittance
be
reserve
for
their
support
;
and
the
poor
one
be
maintain
at
the
public
charge
.
 
<EOS>
after
that
period
,
they
be
hold
incapable
of
any
employment
of
trust
or
profit
;
they
can
not
purchase
land
,
or
take
lease
;
neither
be
they
allow
to
be
witness
in
any
cause
,
either
civil
or
criminal
,
not
even
for
the
decision
of
meer
and
bound
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
ninety
,
they
lose
their
tooth
and
hair
;
they
have
at
that
age
no
distinction
of
taste
,
but
eat
and
drink
whatever
they
can
get
,
without
relish
or
appetite
.
 
<EOS>
the
disease
they
be
subject
to
still
continue
,
without
increase
or
diminish
.
 
<EOS>
in
talk
,
they
forget
the
common
appellation
of
thing
,
and
the
name
of
person
,
even
of
those
who
be
their
near
friend
and
relation
.
<EOS>
for
the
same
reason
,
they
never
can
amuse
themselves
with
reading
,
because
their
memory
will
not
serve
to
carry
them
from
the
beginning
of
a
sentence
to
the
end
;
and
by
this
defect
,
they
be
deprive
of
the
only
entertainment
<EOS>
whereof
they
may
otherwise
be
capable
.
  
<EOS>
the
language
of
this
country
be
always
upon
the
flux
,
the
struldbrug
of
one
age
do
not
understand
those
of
another
;
neither
be
they
able
,
after
two
hundred
year
,
to
hold
any
conversation
(
farther
than
by
a
few
general
word
)
with
their
neighbour
the
mortal
;
and
thus
they
lie
under
the
disadvantage
of
live
like
foreigner
in
their
own
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
account
give
me
of
the
struldbrug
,
as
near
as
I
can
remember
.
 
<EOS>
I
afterwards
see
five
or
six
of
different
age
,
the
young
not
above
two
hundred
year
old
,
who
be
bring
to
me
at
several
time
by
some
of
my
friend
;
but
although
they
be
tell
,
"
that
I
be
a
great
traveller
,
and
have
see
all
the
world
,
"
they
have
not
the
least
curiosity
to
ask
me
a
question
;
only
desire
"
I
would
give
them
slumskudask
,
"
or
a
token
of
remembrance
;
which
be
a
modest
way
of
beg
,
to
avoid
the
law
,
that
strictly
forbid
it
,
because
they
be
provide
for
by
the
public
,
although
indeed
with
a
very
scanty
allowance
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
despise
and
hate
by
all
sort
of
people
.
 
<EOS>
when
one
of
them
be
bear
,
it
be
reckon
ominous
,
and
their
birth
be
record
very
particularly
so
that
you
may
know
their
age
by
consult
the
register
,
which
,
however
,
have
not
be
keep
above
a
thousand
year
past
,
or
at
least
have
be
destroy
by
time
or
public
disturbance
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
usual
way
of
compute
how
old
they
be
,
be
by
ask
them
what
king
or
great
person
they
can
remember
,
and
then
consult
history
;
for
infallibly
the
last
prince
in
their
mind
do
not
begin
his
reign
after
they
be
fourscore
year
old
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
the
most
mortifying
sight
I
ever
beheld
;
and
the
woman
more
horrible
than
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
besides
the
usual
deformity
in
extreme
old
age
,
they
acquire
an
additional
ghastliness
,
in
proportion
to
their
number
of
year
,
which
be
not
to
be
describe
;
and
among
half
a
dozen
,
I
soon
distinguish
which
be
the
eld
,
although
there
be
not
above
a
century
or
two
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
will
easily
believe
,
that
from
what
I
have
hear
and
see
,
my
keen
appetite
for
perpetuity
of
life
be
much
abate
.
 
<EOS>
I
grow
heartily
ashamed
of
the
pleasing
vision
I
have
form
;
and
think
no
tyrant
could
invent
a
death
into
which
I
would
not
run
with
pleasure
,
from
such
a
life
.
 
<EOS>
the
king
hear
of
all
that
have
pass
between
me
and
my
friend
upon
this
occasion
,
and
rally
me
very
pleasantly
;
wish
I
could
send
a
couple
of
struldbrug
to
my
own
country
,
to
arm
our
people
against
the
fear
of
death
;
but
this
,
it
seem
,
be
forbid
by
the
fundamental
law
of
the
kingdom
,
or
else
I
should
have
be
well
content
with
the
trouble
and
expense
of
transport
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
agree
,
that
the
law
of
this
kingdom
relative
to
the
struldbrug
be
found
upon
the
strong
reason
,
and
such
as
any
other
country
would
be
under
the
necessity
of
enact
,
in
the
like
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
otherwise
,
as
avarice
be
the
necessary
consequence
of
old
age
,
those
immortal
would
in
time
become
proprietor
of
the
whole
nation
,
and
engross
the
civil
power
,
which
,
for
want
of
ability
to
manage
,
must
end
in
the
ruin
of
the
public
.
   
<EOS>
the
author
leave
Luggnagg
,
and
sail
to
Japan
.
 
<EOS>
from
thence
he
return
in
a
dutch
ship
to
Amsterdam
,
and
from
Amsterdam
to
England
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
this
account
of
the
struldbrug
may
be
some
entertainment
to
the
reader
,
because
it
seem
to
be
a
little
out
of
the
common
way
;
at
least
I
do
not
remember
to
have
meet
the
like
in
any
book
of
travel
that
have
come
to
my
hand
:
 
<EOS>
and
if
I
be
deceive
,
my
excuse
must
be
,
that
it
be
necessary
for
traveller
who
describe
the
same
country
,
very
often
to
agree
in
dwell
on
the
same
particular
,
without
deserve
the
censure
of
have
borrow
or
transcribe
from
those
who
write
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
indeed
a
perpetual
commerce
between
this
kingdom
and
the
great
empire
of
Japan
;
and
it
be
very
probable
,
that
the
japanese
author
may
have
give
some
account
of
the
struldbrug
;
but
my
stay
in
Japan
be
so
short
,
and
I
be
so
entirely
a
stranger
to
the
language
,
that
I
be
not
qualified
to
make
any
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
hope
the
Dutch
,
upon
this
notice
,
will
be
curious
and
able
enough
to
supply
my
defect
.
  
<EOS>
His
majesty
have
often
press
me
to
accept
some
employment
in
his
court
,
and
find
me
absolutely
determine
to
return
to
my
native
country
,
be
pleased
to
give
me
his
license
to
depart
;
and
honour
me
with
a
letter
of
recommendation
,
under
his
own
hand
,
to
the
Emperor
of
Japan
.
 
<EOS>
He
likewise
present
me
with
four
hundred
and
forty
-
four
large
piece
of
gold
(
this
nation
delight
in
even
number
)
,
and
a
red
diamond
,
which
I
sell
in
England
for
eleven
hundred
pound
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
6th
of
May
,
1709
,
I
take
a
solemn
leave
of
his
majesty
,
and
all
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
this
prince
be
so
gracious
as
to
order
a
guard
to
conduct
me
to
Glanguenstald
,
which
be
a
royal
port
to
the
south
-
west
part
of
the
island
.
 
<EOS>
in
six
day
I
find
a
vessel
ready
to
carry
me
to
Japan
,
and
spend
fifteen
day
in
the
voyage
.
 
<EOS>
We
land
at
a
small
port
-
town
call
Xamoschi
,
situate
on
the
south
-
east
part
of
Japan

the
town
lie
on
the
western
point

where
there
be
a
narrow
strait
lead
northward
into
along
arm
of
the
sea

upon
the
north

west
part

Yedo
,
the
metropolis
,
stand
.
 
<EOS>
at
landing
,
I
show
the
custom
-
house
officer
my
letter
from
the
king
of
Luggnagg
to
his
imperial
majesty
.
 
<EOS>
They
know
the
seal
perfectly
well
;
it
be
as
broad
as
the
palm
of
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
impression
be
,
a
king
lift
up
a
LAME
BEGGAR
from
the
EARTH
.
 
<EOS>
the
magistrate
of
the
town
,
hearing
of
my
letter
,
receive
me
as
a
public
minister
.
<EOS>
They
provide
me
with
carriage
and
servant
,
and
bore
my
charge
to
Yedo
;
where
I
be
admit
to
an
audience
,
and
deliver
my
letter
,
which
be
open
with
great
ceremony
,
and
explain
to
the
Emperor
by
an
interpreter
,
who
then
give
me
notice
,
by
his
majesty
's
order
,
"
that
I
should
signify
my
request
,
and
,
whatever
it
be
,
it
should
be
grant
,
for
the
sake
of
his
royal
brother
of
Luggnagg
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
interpreter
be
a
person
employ
to
transact
affair
with
the
Hollanders
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
conjecture
,
by
my
countenance
,
that
I
be
a
European
,
and
therefore
repeat
his
majesty
's
command
in
Low
Dutch
,
which
he
speak
perfectly
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
answer
,
as
I
have
before
determine
,
"
that
I
be
a
dutch
merchant
,
shipwreck
in
a
very
remote
country
,
whence
I
have
travel
by
sea
and
land
to
Luggnagg
,
and
then
take
shipping
for
Japan
;
where
I
know
my
countryman
often
trade
,
and
with
some
of
these
I
hope
to
get
an
opportunity
of
return
into
Europe
:
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
most
humbly
entreat
his
royal
favour
,
to
give
order
that
I
should
be
conduct
in
safety
to
Nangasac
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
to
this
I
add
another
petition
,
"
that
for
the
sake
of
my
patron
the
king
of
Luggnagg
,
his
majesty
would
condescend
to
excuse
my
perform
the
ceremony
impose
on
my
countryman
,
of
trample
upon
the
crucifix
:
 
because
I
have
be
throw
into
his
kingdom
by
my
misfortune
,
without
any
intention
of
trading
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
when
this
latter
petition
be
interpret
to
the
Emperor
,
he
seem
a
little
surprised
;
and
say
,
"
he
believe
I
be
the
first
of
my
countryman
who
ever
make
any
scruple
in
this
point
;
and
that
he
begin
to
doubt
,
whether
I
be
a
real
Hollander
,
or
not
;
but
rather
suspect
I
must
be
a
Christian
.
<EOS>
however
,
for
the
reason
I
have
offer
,
but
chiefly
to
gratify
the
king
of
Luggnagg
by
an
uncommon
mark
of
his
favour
,
he
would
comply
with
the
singularity
of
my
humour
;
but
the
affair
must
be
manage
with
dexterity
,
and
his
officer
should
be
command
to
let
me
pass
,
as
it
be
by
forgetfulness
.
 
<EOS>
for
he
assure
me
,
that
if
the
secret
should
be
discover
by
my
countryman
the
Dutch
,
they
would
cut
my
throat
in
the
voyage
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
return
my
thank
,
by
the
interpreter
,
for
so
unusual
a
favour
;
and
some
troop
be
at
that
time
on
their
march
to
Nangasac
<EOS>
,
the
command
officer
have
order
to
convey
me
safe
thither
,
with
particular
instruction
about
the
business
of
the
crucifix
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
9th
day
of
June
,
1709
,
I
arrive
at
Nangasac
,
after
a
very
long
and
troublesome
journey
.
 
<EOS>
I
soon
fall
into
the
company
of
some
dutch
sailor
belong
to
the
Amboyna
,
of
Amsterdam
,
a
stout
ship
of
450
ton
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
live
long
in
Holland
,
pursue
my
study
at
Leyden
,
and
I
speak
Dutch
well
.
 
<EOS>
the
seaman
soon
know
whence
<EOS>
I
come
last
:
 
<EOS>
they
be
curious
to
inquire
into
my
voyage
and
course
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
up
a
story
as
short
and
probable
as
I
could
,
but
conceal
the
great
part
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
many
person
in
Holland
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
able
to
invent
name
for
my
parent
,
whom
I
pretend
to
be
obscure
people
in
the
province
of
Gelderland
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
give
the
captain
(
one
Theodorus
Vangrult
)
what
he
please
to
ask
for
my
voyage
to
Holland
;
but
understanding
<EOS>
I
be
a
surgeon
,
he
be
content
to
take
half
the
usual
rate
,
on
condition
that
I
would
serve
him
in
the
way
of
my
calling
.
 
<EOS>
before
we
take
shipping
,
I
be
often
ask
by
some
of
the
crew
,
whether
I
have
perform
the
ceremony
above
mention
?
 
<EOS>
I
evade
the
question
by
general
answer
;
"
that
I
have
satisfy
the
Emperor
and
court
in
all
particular
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
however
,
a
malicious
rogue
of
a
skipper
go
to
an
officer
,
and
point
to
me
,
tell
him
,
"
I
have
not
yet
trample
on
the
crucifix
;
"
but
the
other
,
who
have
receive
instruction
to
let
me
pass
,
give
the
rascal
twenty
stroke
on
the
shoulder
with
a
bamboo
;
after
which
I
be
no
more
troubled
with
such
question
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
happen
worth
mention
in
this
voyage
.
 
<EOS>
We
sail
with
a
fair
wind
to
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
,
where
we
staid
only
to
take
in
fresh
water
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
10th
of
April
,
1710
,
we
arrive
safe
at
Amsterdam
,
have
lose
only
three
man
by
sickness
in
the
voyage
,
and
a
fourth
,
who
fall
from
the
foremast
into
the
sea
,
not
far
from
the
coast
of
Guinea
.
 
<EOS>
from
Amsterdam
<EOS>
I
soon
after
set
sail
for
England
,
in
a
small
vessel
belong
to
that
city
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
16th
of
April
we
put
in
at
the
Downs
.
 
<EOS>
I
land
next
morning
,
and
see
once
more
my
native
country
,
after
an
absence
of
five
year
and
six
month
complete
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
straight
to
Redriff
,
where
I
arrive
the
same
day
at
two
in
the
afternoon
,
and
find
my
wife

PART
IV
:
<EOS>
a
voyage
to
the
COUNTRY
of
the
HOUYHNHNMS
.
 
<EOS>
the
author
set
out
as
captain
of
a
ship
.
 
<EOS>
His
man
conspire
against
him
,
confine
him
a
long
time
to
his
cabin
,
and
set
him
on
shore
in
an
unknown
land
.
 
<EOS>
He
travel
up
into
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
the
Yahoos
,
a
strange
sort
of
animal
,
describe
.
 
<EOS>
the
author
meet
two
Houyhnhnms
.
 
<EOS>
I
continue
at
home
with
my
wife
and
child
about
five
month
,
in
a
very
happy
condition
,
if
I
could
have
learn
the
lesson
of
know
when
I
be
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
leave
my
poor
wife
big
with
child
,
and
accept
an
advantageous
offer
make
me
to
be
captain
of
the
Adventurer
,
a
stout
merchantman
of
350
ton
:
 
<EOS>
for
I
understand
navigation
well
,
and
be
grow
weary
of
a
surgeon
's
employment
at
sea
,
which
,
however
,
I
could
exercise
upon
occasion
,
I
take
a
skilful
young
man
of
that
calling
,
one
Robert
Purefoy
,
into
my
ship
.
 
<EOS>
We
set
sail
from
Portsmouth
upon
the
7th
day
of
September
,
1710
;
on
the
14th
we
meet
with
Captain
Pocock
,
of
Bristol
,
at
Teneriffe
,
who
be
go
to
the
bay
of
Campechy
to
cut
logwood
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
16th
,
he
be
part
from
us
by
a
storm
;
I
hear
since
my
return
,
that
his
ship
founder
,
and
none
escape
but
one
cabin
boy
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
an
honest
man
,
and
a
good
sailor
,
but
a
little
too
positive
in
his
own
opinion
,
which
be
the
cause
of
his
destruction
,
as
it
have
be
with
several
other
;
for
if
he
have
follow
my
advice
,
he
may
have
be
safe
at
home
with
his
family
at
this
time
,
as
well
as
myself
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
several
man
who
die
in
my
ship
of
calenture
,
so
that
I
be
force
to
get
recruit
out
of
barbadoe
and
the
Leeward
Islands
,
where
I
touch
,
by
the
direction
of
the
merchant
who
employ
me
;
<EOS>
which
I
have
soon
too
much
cause
to
repent
:
 
for
I
find
afterwards
,
that
most
of
them
have
be
buccaneer
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
fifty
hand
onboard
;
and
my
order
be
,
that
I
should
trade
with
the
Indians
in
the
South
-
Sea
,
and
make
what
discovery
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
these
rogue
,
whom
I
have
pick
up
,
debauch
my
other
man
,
and
they
all
form
a
conspiracy
to
seize
the
ship
,
and
secure
me
;
which
they
do
one
morning
,
rush
into
my
cabin
,
and
bind
me
hand
and
foot
,
threaten
to
throw
me
overboard
,
if
I
offer
to
stir
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
them
,
"
I
be
their
prisoner
,
and
would
submit
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
they
make
me
swear
to
do
,
and
then
they
unbound
me
,
only
fasten
one
of
my
leg
with
a
chain
,
near
my
bed
,
and
place
a
sentry
at
my
door
with
his
piece
charge
,
who
be
command
to
shoot
me
dead
if
I
attempt
my
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
They
send
me
own
victual
and
drink
,
and
take
the
government
of
the
ship
to
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Their
design
be
to
turn
pirate
and
,
plunder
the
Spaniards
,
which
they
could
not
do
till
they
get
more
man
.
 
<EOS>
but
first
they
resolve
to
sell
the
good
the
ship
,
and
then
go
to
Madagascar
for
recruit
,
several
among
them
have
die
since
my
confinement
.
 
<EOS>
They
sail
many
week
,
and
trade
with
the
Indians
;
but
I
know
not
what
course
they
take
,
be
keep
a
close
prisoner
in
my
cabin
,
and
expect
nothing
less
than
to
be
murder
,
as
they
often
threaten
me
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
9th
day
of
May
,
1711
,
one
James
Welch
come
down
to
my
cabin
,
and
say
,
"
he
have
order
from
the
captain
to
set
me
ashore
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
expostulate
with
him
,
but
in
vain
;
neither
would
he
so
much
as
tell
me
who
their
new
captain
be
.
 
<EOS>
They
force
me
into
the
long
-
boat
,
let
me
put
on
my
good
suit
of
clothe
,
which
be
as
good
as
new
,
and
take
a
small
bundle
of
linen
,
but
no
arm
,
except
my
hanger
;
and
they
be
so
civil
as
not
to
search
my
pocket
,
<EOS>
into
which
I
convey
what
money
I
have
,
with
some
other
little
necessary
.
 
<EOS>
They
row
about
a
league
,
and
then
set
me
down
on
a
strand
.
 
<EOS>
I
desire
them
to
tell
me
what
country
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
swear
,
"
they
know
no
more
than
myself
;
"
but
say
,
"
that
the
captain
"
(
as
they
call
him
)
"
be
resolve
,
after
they
have
sell
the
lading
,
to
get
rid
of
me
in
the
first
place
where
they
could
discover
land
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
push
off
immediately
,
advise
me
to
make
haste
for
fear
of
be
overtake
by
the
tide
,
and
so
bade
me
farewell
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
desolate
condition
I
advance
forward
,
and
soon
get
upon
firm
ground
,
where
I
sit
down
on
a
bank
to
rest
myself
,
and
consider
what
I
have
best
do
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
be
a
little
refreshed
,
I
go
up
into
the
country
,
resolve
to
deliver
myself
to
the
first
savage
I
should
meet
,
and
purchase
my
life
from
them
by
some
bracelet
,
glass
ring
,
and
other
toy
,
which
sailor
usually
provide
themselves
with
in
those
voyage
,
and
whereof
I
have
some
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
land
be
divide
by
long
row
of
tree
,
not
regularly
plant
,
but
naturally
grow
;
there
be
great
plenty
of
grass
,
and
several
field
of
oats
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
very
circumspectly
,
for
fear
of
be
surprised
,
or
suddenly
shoot
with
an
arrow
from
behind
,
or
on
either
side
.
 
<EOS>
I
fall
into
a
beat
road
,
where
I
see
many
tract
of
human
foot
,
and
some
of
cow
,
but
most
of
horse
.
<EOS>
at
last
I
beheld
several
animal
in
a
field
,
and
one
or
two
of
the
same
kind
sit
in
tree
.
 
<EOS>
Their
shape
be
very
singular
and
deform
,
which
a
little
discompose
me
,
so
that
I
lie
down
behind
a
thicket
to
observe
them
better
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
them
come
forward
near
the
place
where
I
lay
,
give
me
an
opportunity
of
distinctly
mark
their
form
.
 
<EOS>
Their
head
and
breast
be
cover
with
a
thick
hair
,
some
frizzle
,
and
other
lank
;
they
have
beard
like
goat
,
and
a
long
ridge
of
hair
down
their
back
,
and
the
fore
part
of
their
leg
and
foot
;
but
the
rest
of
their
body
be
bare
,
so
that
I
may
see
their
skin
,
which
be
of
a
brown
buff
colour
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
no
tail
,
nor
any
hair
at
all
on
their
buttock
,
except
about
the
anus
,
which
,
I
presume
,
nature
have
place
there
to
defend
them
as
they
sit
on
the
ground
,
for
this
posture
they
use
,
as
well
as
lie
down
,
and
often
stand
on
their
hind
foot
.
 
<EOS>
They
climb
high
tree
as
nimbly
as
a
squirrel
,
for
they
have
strong
extended
claws
before
and
behind
,
terminate
in
sharp
point
,
and
hook
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
often
spring
,
and
bind
,
and
leap
,
with
prodigious
agility
.
<EOS>
the
female
be
not
so
large
as
the
male
;
they
have
long
lank
hair
on
their
head
,
but
none
on
their
face
,
nor
any
thing
more
than
a
sort
of
down
on
the
rest
of
their
body
,
except
about
the
anus
and
pudenda
.
 
<EOS>
the
dug
hang
between
their
fore
foot
,
and
often
reach
almost
to
the
ground
as
they
walk
.
 
<EOS>
the
hair
of
both
sex
be
of
several
colour
,
brown
,
red
,
black
,
and
yellow
.
 
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
I
never
beheld
,
in
all
my
travel
,
so
disagreeable
an
animal
,
or
one
against
which
I
naturally
conceive
so
strong
an
antipathy
.
 
<EOS>
so
that
,
think
I
have
see
enough
,
full
of
contempt
and
aversion
,
I
get
up
,
and
pursue
the
beaten
road
,
hope
it
may
direct
me
to
the
cabin
of
some
Indian
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
get
far
,
when
I
meet
one
of
these
creature
full
in
my
way
,
and
come
up
directly
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
ugly
monster
,
when
he
see
me
,
distort
several
way
,
every
feature
of
his
visage
,
and
stare
,
as
at
an
object
he
have
never
see
before
;
then
approach
nearer
,
lift
up
his
fore
-
paw
,
whether
out
of
curiosity
or
mischief
I
could
not
tell
;
but
I
draw
my
hanger
,
and
give
him
a
good
blow
with
the
flat
side
of
it
,
for
I
durst
not
strike
with
the
edge
,
fear
the
inhabitant
may
be
provoke
against
me
,
if
they
should
come
to
know
that
I
have
kill
or
maim
any
of
their
cattle
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
beast
feel
the
smart
,
he
draw
back
,
and
roar
so
loud
,
that
a
herd
of
at
least
forty
come
flock
about
me
from
the
next
field
,
howl
and
make
odious
face
;
but
I
run
to
the
body
of
a
tree
,
and
lean
my
back
against
it
,
keep
them
off
by
wave
my
hanger
.
 
<EOS>
several
of
this
curse
brood
,
get
hold
of
the
branch
behind
,
leap
up
into
the
tree
<EOS>
,
whence
they
begin
to
discharge
their
excrement
on
my
head
;
however
,
I
escape
pretty
well
by
stick
close
to
the
stem
of
the
tree
,
but
be
almost
stifle
with
the
filth
,
which
fall
about
me
on
every
side
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
this
distress
,
I
observe
them
all
to
run
away
on
a
sudden
as
fast
as
they
could
;
at
which
I
venture
to
leave
the
tree
and
pursue
the
road
,
wonder
what
it
be
that
could
put
them
into
this
fright
.
 
<EOS>
but
look
on
my
left
hand
,
I
see
a
horse
walk
softly
in
the
field
;
which
my
persecutor
have
sooner
discover
,
be
the
cause
of
their
flight
.
 
<EOS>
the
horse
start
a
little
,
when
he
come
near
me
,
but
soon
recover
himself
,
look
full
in
my
face
with
manifest
token
of
wonder
;
he
view
my
hand
and
foot
,
walk
round
me
several
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
pursue
my
journey
,
but
he
place
himself
directly
in
the
way
,
yet
look
with
a
very
mild
aspect
,
never
offer
the
least
violence
.
 
<EOS>
We
stand
gaze
at
each
other
for
some
time
;
at
last
I
take
the
boldness
to
reach
my
hand
towards
his
neck
with
a
design
to
stroke
it
,
use
the
common
style
and
whistle
of
jockey
,
when
they
be
go
to
handle
a
strange
horse
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
animal
seem
to
receive
my
civility
with
disdain
,
shake
his
head
,
and
bend
his
brow
,
softly
raise
up
his
right
fore
-
foot
to
remove
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
neigh
three
or
four
time
,
but
in
so
different
a
cadence
,
that
I
almost
begin
to
think
he
be
speak
to
himself
,
in
some
language
of
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
while
he
and
I
be
thus
employ
,
another
horse
come
up
;
who
apply
himself
to
the
first
in
a
very
formal
manner
,
they
gently
strike
each
other
's
right
hoof
before
,
neigh
several
time
by
turn
,
and
vary
the
sound
,
which
seem
to
be
almost
articulate
.
<EOS>
They
go
some
pace
off
,
as
if
it
be
to
confer
together
,
walk
side
by
side
,
backward
and
forward
,
like
person
deliberate
upon
some
affair
of
weight
,
but
often
turn
their
eye
towards
me
,
as
it
be
to
watch
that
I
may
not
escape
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
amazed
to
see
such
action
and
behaviour
in
brute
beast
;
and
conclude
with
myself
,
that
if
the
inhabitant
of
this
country
be
endue
with
a
proportionable
degree
of
reason
,
they
must
needs
be
the
wise
people
upon
earth
.
 
<EOS>
this
thought
give
me
so
much
comfort
,
that
I
resolve
to
go
forward
,
until
I
could
discover
some
house
or
village
,
or
meet
with
any
of
the
native
,
leave
the
two
horse
to
discourse
together
as
they
please
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
first
,
who
be
a
dapple
gray
,
observe
me
to
steal
off
,
neigh
after
me
in
so
expressive
a
tone
,
that
I
fancy
myself
to
understand
what
he
mean
;
whereupon
I
turn
back
,
and
come
near
to
him
to
expect
his
farther
command
:
 
but
conceal
my
fear
as
much
as
I
could
,
for
I
begin
to
be
in
some
pain
how
this
adventure
may
terminate
;
and
the
reader
will
easily
believe
I
do
not
much
like
my
present
situation
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
horse
come
up
close
to
me
,
look
with
great
earnestness
upon
my
face
and
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
gray
steed
rub
my
hat
all
round
with
his
right
fore
-
hoof
,
and
discompose
it
so
much
that
I
be
force
to
adjust
it
better
by
take
it
off
and
settle
it
again
;
<EOS>
whereat
,
both
he
and
his
companion
(
who
be
a
brown
bay
)
appear
to
be
much
surprised
:
 
<EOS>
the
latter
feel
the
lappet
of
my
coat
,
and
find
it
to
hang
loose
about
me
,
they
both
look
with
new
sign
of
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
He
stroke
my
right
hand
,
seem
to
admire
the
softness
and
colour
;
but
he
squeeze
it
so
hard
between
his
hoof
and
his
pastern
,
that
I
be
force
to
roar
;
after
which
they
both
touch
me
with
all
possible
tenderness
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
under
great
perplexity
about
my
shoe
and
stocking
,
which
they
feel
very
often
,
neigh
to
each
other
,
and
use
various
gesture
,
not
unlike
those
of
a
philosopher
,
when
he
would
attempt
to
solve
some
new
and
difficult
phenomenon
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
the
behaviour
of
these
animal
be
so
orderly
and
rational
,
so
acute
and
judicious
,
that
I
at
last
conclude
they
must
needs
be
magician
,
who
have
thus
metamorphose
themselves
upon
some
design
,
and
see
a
stranger
in
the
way
,
resolve
to
divert
themselves
with
him
;
or
,
perhaps
,
be
really
amazed
at
the
sight
of
a
man
so
very
different
in
habit
,
feature
,
and
complexion
,
from
those
who
may
probably
live
in
so
remote
a
climate
.
 
<EOS>
upon
the
strength
of
this
reasoning
,
I
venture
to
address
them
in
the
follow
manner
:
 
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
if
you
be
conjurer
,
as
I
have
good
cause
to
believe
,
you
can
understand
my
language
;
therefore
I
make
bold
to
let
your
worship
know
that
I
be
a
poor
distressed
Englishman
,
drive
by
his
misfortune
upon
your
coast
;
and
I
entreat
one
of
you
to
let
me
ride
upon
his
back
,
as
if
he
be
a
real
horse
,
to
some
house
or
village
where
I
can
be
relieve
.
 
<EOS>
in
return
of
which
favour
,
I
will
make
you
a
present
of
this
knife
and
bracelet
,
"
take
them
out
of
my
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
creature
stand
silent
while
I
speak
,
seem
to
listen
with
great
attention
,
and
when
I
have
end
,
they
neigh
frequently
towards
each
other
,
as
if
they
be
engage
in
serious
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
I
plainly
observe
that
their
language
express
the
passion
very
well
,
and
the
word
may
,
with
little
pain
,
be
resolve
into
an
alphabet
more
easily
than
the
Chinese
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
frequently
distinguish
the
word
Yahoo
,
which
be
repeat
by
each
of
them
several
time
:
 
and
<EOS>
although
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
conjecture
what
it
mean
,
yet
while
the
two
horse
be
busy
in
conversation
,
I
endeavour
to
practise
this
word
upon
my
tongue
;
and
as
soon
as
they
be
silent
,
I
boldly
pronounce
Yahoo
in
a
loud
voice
,
imitate
at
the
same
time
,
as
near
as
I
could
,
the
neighing
of
a
horse
;
at
which
they
be
both
visibly
surprised
;
and
the
gray
repeat
the
same
word
twice
,
as
if
he
mean
to
teach
me
the
right
accent
;
wherein
I
speak
after
him
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
find
myself
perceivably
to
improve
every
time
,
though
very
far
from
any
degree
of
perfection
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
bay
try
me
with
a
second
word
,
much
hard
to
be
pronounce
;
but
reduce
it
to
the
english
orthography
,
may
be
spelt
thus
,
Houyhnhnm
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
succeed
in
this
so
well
as
in
the
former
;
but
after
two
or
three
farth
trial
,
I
have
well
fortune
;
and
they
both
appear
amazed
at
my
capacity
.
  
<EOS>
after
some
further
discourse
,
which
I
then
conjecture
may
relate
to
me
,
the
two
friend
take
their
leave
,
with
the
same
compliment
of
strike
each
other
's
hoof
;
and
the
gray
make
me
sign
that
I
should
walk
before
him
;
wherein
I
think
it
prudent
to
comply
,
till
I
could
find
a
well
director
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
offer
to
slacken
my
pace
,
he
would
cry
hhuun
hhuun
:
 
<EOS>
I
guess
his
meaning
,
and
give
him
to
understand
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
"
that
I
be
weary
,
and
not
able
to
walk
faster
;
"
upon
which
he
would
stand
awhile
to
let
me
rest
.
   
<EOS>
the
author
conduct
by
a
Houyhnhnm
to
his
house
.
 
<EOS>
the
house
describe
.
 
<EOS>
the
author
's
reception
.
 
<EOS>
the
food
of
the
Houyhnhnms
.
<EOS>
the
author
in
distress
for
want
of
meat
.
 
<EOS>
be
at
last
relieved
.
 
<EOS>
His
manner
of
feed
in
this
country
.
 
<EOS>
have
travel
about
three
mile
,
we
come
to
a
long
kind
of
building
,
make
of
timber
stick
in
the
ground
,
and
wattle
across
;
the
roof
be
low
and
cover
with
straw
.
 
<EOS>
I
now
begin
to
be
a
little
comfort
;
and
take
out
some
toy
,
which
traveller
usually
carry
for
present
to
the
savage
Indians
of
America
,
and
other
part
,
in
hope
the
people
of
the
house
would
be
thereby
encourage
to
receive
me
kindly
.
 
<EOS>
the
horse
make
me
a
sign
to
go
in
first
;
it
be
a
large
room
with
a
smooth
clay
floor
,
and
a
rack
and
manger
,
extend
the
whole
length
on
one
side
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
three
nag
and
two
mare
,
not
eat
,
but
some
of
them
sit
down
upon
their
ham
,
which
I
very
much
wonder
at
;
but
wonder
more
to
see
the
rest
employ
in
domestic
business
;
these
seem
but
ordinary
cattle
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
this
confirm
my
first
opinion
,
that
a
people
who
could
so
far
civilise
brute
animal
,
must
needs
excel
in
wisdom
all
the
nation
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
the
gray
come
in
just
after
,
and
thereby
prevent
any
ill
treatment
which
the
other
may
have
give
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
neigh
to
them
several
time
in
a
style
of
authority
,
and
receive
answer
.
  
<EOS>
beyond
this
room
there
be
three
other
,
reach
the
length
of
the
house
,
to
which
you
pass
through
three
door
,
opposite
to
each
other
,
in
the
manner
of
a
vista
.
 
<EOS>
We
go
through
the
second
room
towards
the
third
.
 
<EOS>
here
the
gray
walk
in
first
,
beckon
me
to
attend
:
 
<EOS>
I
wait
in
the
second
room
,
and
get
ready
my
present
for
the
master
and
mistress
of
the
house
;
they
be
two
knife
,
three
bracelet
of
false
pearl
,
a
small
looking
-
glass
,
and
a
bead
necklace
.
 
<EOS>
the
horse
neigh
three
or
four
time
,
and
I
wait
to
hear
some
answer
in
a
human
voice
,
but
I
hear
no
other
return
than
in
the
same
dialect
,
only
one
or
two
a
little
shriller
than
his
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
that
this
house
must
belong
to
some
person
of
great
note
among
them
,
because
there
appear
so
much
ceremony
before
I
could
gain
admittance
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
that
a
man
of
quality
should
be
serve
all
by
horse
,
be
beyond
my
comprehension
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
my
brain
be
disturb
by
my
suffering
and
misfortune
.
 
<EOS>
I
rouse
myself
,
and
look
about
me
in
the
room
where
I
be
leave
alone
:
 
<EOS>
this
be
furnish
like
the
first
,
only
after
a
more
elegant
manner
.
 
<EOS>
I
rub
my
eye
often
,
but
the
same
object
still
occur
.
 
<EOS>
I
pinch
my
arm
and
side
to
awake
myself
,
hope
I
may
be
in
a
dream
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
absolutely
conclude
,
that
all
these
appearance
could
be
nothing
else
but
necromancy
and
magic
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
no
time
to
pursue
these
reflection
;
for
the
gray
horse
come
to
the
door
,
and
make
me
a
sign
to
follow
him
into
the
third
room
where
I
see
a
very
comely
mare
,
together
with
a
colt
and
foal
,
sit
on
their
haunch
upon
mat
of
straw
,
not
unartfully
make
,
and
perfectly
neat
and
clean
.
  
<EOS>
the
mare
soon
after
my
entrance
rise
from
her
mat
,
and
come
up
close
,
after
have
nicely
observe
my
hand
and
face
,
give
me
a
most
contemptuous
look
;
and
turn
to
the
horse
<EOS>
,
I
hear
the
word
Yahoo
often
repeat
betwixt
them
;
the
meaning
of
which
word
I
could
not
then
comprehend
,
although
it
be
the
first
I
have
learn
to
pronounce
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
soon
better
inform
,
to
my
everlasting
mortification
;
for
the
horse
,
beckon
to
me
with
his
head
,
and
repeat
the
hhuun
,
hhuun
,
as
he
do
upon
the
road
,
which
I
understand
be
to
attend
him
,
lead
me
out
into
a
kind
of
court
,
where
be
another
building
,
at
some
distance
from
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
here
we
enter
,
and
I
see
three
of
those
detestable
creature
,
which
I
first
meet
after
my
landing
,
feed
upon
root
,
and
the
flesh
of
some
animal
,
which
I
afterwards
find
to
be
that
of
ass
and
dog
,
and
now
and
then
a
cow
,
dead
by
accident
or
disease
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
all
tie
by
the
neck
with
strong
withe
fasten
to
a
beam
;
they
hold
their
food
between
the
claws
of
their
fore
foot
,
and
tear
it
with
their
tooth
.
  
<EOS>
the
master
horse
order
a
sorrel
nag
,
one
of
his
servant
,
to
untie
the
large
of
these
animal
,
and
take
him
into
the
yard
.
<EOS>
the
beast
and
I
be
bring
close
together
,
and
by
our
countenance
diligently
compare
both
by
master
and
servant
,
who
thereupon
repeat
several
time
the
word
Yahoo
.
 
<EOS>
My
horror
and
astonishment
be
not
to
be
describe
,
when
I
observe
in
this
abominable
animal
,
a
perfect
human
figure
:
 
the
face
of
it
indeed
be
flat
and
broad
,
the
nose
depress
,
the
lip
large
,
and
the
mouth
wide
;
but
these
difference
be
common
to
all
savage
nation
,
where
the
lineament
of
the
countenance
be
distort
,
by
the
native
suffer
their
infant
to
lie
grovel
on
the
earth
,
or
by
carry
them
on
their
back
,
nuzzle
with
their
face
against
the
mother
'
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
the
fore
-
foot
of
the
Yahoo
differ
from
my
hand
in
nothing
else
but
the
length
of
the
nail
,
the
coarseness
and
brownness
of
the
palm
,
and
the
hairiness
on
the
back
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
same
resemblance
between
our
foot
,
with
the
same
difference
;
which
I
know
very
well
,
though
the
horse
do
not
,
because
of
my
shoe
and
stocking
;
the
same
in
every
part
of
our
body
except
as
to
hairiness
and
colour
,
which
I
have
already
describe
.
  
<EOS>
the
great
difficulty
that
seem
to
stick
with
the
two
horse
,
be
to
see
the
rest
of
my
body
so
very
different
from
that
of
a
Yahoo
,
for
which
I
be
oblige
to
my
clothe
,
whereof
they
have
no
conception
.
 
<EOS>
the
sorrel
nag
offer
me
a
root
,
which
he
hold
(
after
their
manner
,
as
we
shall
describe
in
its
proper
place
)
between
his
hoof
and
pastern
;
I
take
it
in
my
hand
,
and
,
have
smell
it
,
return
it
to
him
again
as
civilly
as
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
He
bring
out
of
the
Yahoos
'
<EOS>
kennel
a
piece
of
ass
's
flesh
;
but
it
smell
so
offensively
that
I
turn
from
it
with
loathing
:
 
<EOS>
he
then
throw
it
to
the
Yahoo
,
by
whom
it
be
greedily
devour
.
 
<EOS>
He
afterwards
show
me
a
wisp
of
hay
,
and
a
fetlock
full
of
oats
;
but
I
shake
my
head
,
to
signify
that
neither
of
these
be
food
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
indeed
I
now
apprehend
that
I
must
absolutely
starve
,
if
I
do
not
get
to
some
of
my
own
specie
;
for
as
to
those
filthy
Yahoos
,
although
there
be
few
great
lover
of
mankind
at
that
time
than
myself
,
yet
<EOS>
I
confess
I
never
see
any
sensitive
be
so
detestable
on
all
account
;
and
the
more
I
come
near
them
the
more
hateful
they
grow
,
while
I
stay
in
that
country
.
 
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
the
master
horse
observe
by
my
behaviour
,
and
therefore
send
the
Yahoo
back
to
his
kennel
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
put
his
fore
-
hoof
to
his
mouth
,
at
which
I
be
much
surprised
,
although
he
do
it
with
ease
,
and
with
a
motion
that
appear
perfectly
natural
,
and
make
other
sign
,
to
know
what
I
would
eat
;
but
I
could
not
return
him
such
an
answer
as
he
be
able
to
apprehend
;
and
if
he
have
understand
me
,
I
do
not
see
how
it
be
possible
to
contrive
any
way
for
find
myself
nourishment
.
<EOS>
while
we
be
thus
engage
,
I
observe
a
cow
pass
by
,
whereupon
I
point
to
her
,
and
express
a
desire
to
go
and
milk
her
.
 
<EOS>
this
have
its
effect
;
for
he
lead
me
back
into
the
house
,
and
order
a
mare
-
servant
to
open
a
room
,
where
a
good
store
of
milk
lie
in
earthen
and
wooden
vessel
,
after
a
very
orderly
and
cleanly
manner
.
 
<EOS>
She
give
me
a
large
bowlful
,
of
which
I
drink
very
heartily
,
and
find
myself
well
refresh
.
  
<EOS>
about
noon
,
I
see
come
towards
the
house
a
kind
of
vehicle
draw
like
a
sledge
by
four
Yahoos
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
in
it
an
old
steed
,
who
seem
to
be
of
quality
;
he
alight
with
his
hind
-
foot
forward
,
have
by
accident
get
a
hurt
in
his
left
fore
-
foot
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
to
dine
with
our
horse
,
who
receive
him
with
great
civility
.
 
<EOS>
They
dine
in
the
good
room
,
and
have
oat
boil
in
milk
for
the
second
course
,
which
the
old
horse
eat
warm
,
but
the
rest
cold
.
 
<EOS>
Their
manger
be
place
circular
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
and
divide
into
several
partition
,
round
which
they
sit
on
their
haunch
,
upon
boss
of
straw
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
middle
be
a
large
rack
,
with
angle
answer
to
every
partition
of
the
manger
;
so
that
each
horse
and
mare
eat
their
own
hay
,
and
their
own
mash
of
oats
and
milk
,
with
much
decency
and
regularity
.
 
<EOS>
the
behaviour
of
the
young
colt
and
foal
appear
very
modest
,
and
that
of
the
master
and
mistress
extremely
cheerful
and
complaisant
to
their
guest
.
 
<EOS>
the
gray
order
me
to
stand
by
him
;
and
much
discourse
pass
between
him
and
his
friend
concern
me
,
as
I
find
by
the
stranger
's
often
look
on
me
,
and
the
frequent
repetition
of
the
word
Yahoo
.
  
<EOS>
I
happen
to
wear
my
glove
,
which
the
master
gray
observing
,
seem
perplexed
,
discover
sign
of
wonder
what
I
have
do
to
my
fore
-
foot
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
his
hoof
three
or
four
time
to
them
,
as
if
he
would
signify
,
that
I
should
reduce
them
to
their
former
shape
,
which
I
presently
do
,
pull
off
both
my
glove
,
and
put
them
into
my
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
this
occasion
farth
talk
;
and
I
see
the
company
be
pleased
with
my
behaviour
,
whereof
I
soon
find
the
good
effect
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
order
to
speak
the
few
word
I
understand
;
and
while
they
be
at
dinner
,
the
master
teach
me
the
name
for
oats
,
milk
,
fire
,
water
,
and
some
other
,
which
I
could
readily
pronounce
after
him
,
have
from
my
youth
a
great
facility
in
learning
language
.
  
<EOS>
when
dinner
be
do
,
the
master
horse
take
me
aside
,
and
by
sign
and
word
make
me
understand
the
concern
he
be
in
that
I
have
nothing
to
eat
.
 
<EOS>
Oats
in
their
tongue
be
call
hlunnh
.
 
<EOS>
this
word
I
pronounce
two
or
three
time
;
for
although
I
have
refuse
them
at
first
,
yet
,
upon
second
thought
,
I
consider
that
I
could
contrive
to
make
of
them
a
kind
of
bread
,
which
may
be
sufficient
,
with
milk
,
to
keep
me
alive
,
till
I
could
make
my
escape
to
some
other
country
,
and
to
creature
of
my
own
specie
.
<EOS>
the
horse
immediately
order
a
white
mare
servant
of
his
family
to
bring
me
a
good
quantity
of
oats
in
a
sort
of
wooden
tray
.
 
<EOS>
these
I
heat
before
the
fire
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
rub
them
till
the
husk
come
off
,
which
I
make
a
shift
to
winnow
from
the
grain
.
<EOS>
I
grind
and
beat
them
between
two
stone
;
then
take
water
,
and
make
them
into
a
paste
or
cake
,
which
I
toast
at
the
fire
and
eat
warm
with
milk
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
at
first
a
very
insipid
diet
,
though
common
enough
in
many
part
of
Europe
,
but
grow
tolerable
by
time
;
and
have
be
often
reduce
to
hard
fare
in
my
life
,
this
be
not
the
first
experiment
I
have
make
how
easily
nature
be
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
can
not
but
observe
,
that
I
never
have
one
hour
sickness
while
I
stay
in
this
island
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
I
sometimes
make
a
shift
to
catch
a
rabbit
,
or
bird
,
by
spring
make
of
Yahoo
's
hair
;
and
I
often
gather
wholesome
herb
,
which
I
boil
,
and
eat
as
salad
with
my
bread
;
and
now
and
then
,
for
a
rarity
,
I
make
a
little
butter
,
and
drink
the
whey
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
at
first
at
a
great
loss
for
salt
,
but
custom
soon
reconcile
me
to
the
want
of
it
;
and
I
be
confident
that
the
frequent
use
of
salt
among
us
be
an
effect
of
luxury
,
and
be
first
introduce
only
as
a
provocative
to
drink
,
except
where
it
be
necessary
for
preserve
flesh
in
long
voyage
,
or
in
place
remote
from
great
market
;
for
we
observe
no
animal
to
be
fond
of
it
but
<EOS>
man
,
and
as
to
myself
,
when
I
leave
this
country
,
it
be
a
great
while
before
I
could
endure
the
taste
of
it
in
anything
that
I
eat
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
enough
to
say
upon
the
subject
of
my
diet
,
wherewith
other
traveller
fill
their
book
,
as
if
the
reader
be
personally
concerned
whether
we
fare
well
or
ill
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
necessary
to
mention
this
matter
,
lest
the
world
should
think
it
impossible
that
I
could
find
sustenance
for
three
year
in
such
a
country
,
and
among
such
inhabitant
.
  
<EOS>
when
it
grow
towards
evening
,
the
master
horse
order
a
place
for
me
to
lodge
in
;
it
be
but
six
yard
from
the
house
and
separate
from
the
stable
of
the
Yahoos
.
 
<EOS>
here
I
get
some
straw
,
and
cover
myself
with
my
own
clothe
,
sleep
very
sound
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
in
a
short
time
better
accommodate
,
as
the
reader
shall
know
hereafter
,
when
I
come
to
treat
more
particularly
about
my
way
of
living
.
   
<EOS>
the
author
study
to
learn
the
language
.
 
<EOS>
the
Houyhnhnm
,
his
master
,
assist
in
teach
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
language
describe
.
 
<EOS>
Several
Houyhnhnms
of
quality
come
out
of
curiosity
to
see
the
author
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
his
master
a
short
account
of
his
voyage
.
 
<EOS>
My
principal
endeavour
be
to
learn
the
language
,
which
my
master
(
for
<EOS>
so
I
shall
henceforth
call
him
)
,
and
his
child
,
and
every
servant
of
his
house
,
be
desirous
to
teach
me
;
for
they
look
upon
it
as
a
prodigy
,
that
a
brute
animal
should
discover
such
mark
of
a
rational
creature
.
 
<EOS>
I
point
to
every
thing
,
and
inquire
the
name
of
it
,
which
I
write
down
in
my
journal
-
book
when
I
be
alone
,
and
correct
my
bad
accent
by
desire
those
of
the
family
to
pronounce
it
often
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
employment
,
a
sorrel
nag
,
one
of
the
under
-
servant
,
be
very
ready
to
assist
me
.
  
<EOS>
in
speak
,
they
pronounce
through
the
nose
and
throat
,
and
their
language
approach
near
to
the
high
-
dutch
,
or
german
,
of
any
I
know
in
Europe
;
but
be
much
more
graceful
and
significant
.
 
<EOS>
the
emperor
Charles
V.
make
almost
the
same
observation
,
when
he
say
"
that
if
he
be
to
speak
to
his
horse
,
it
should
be
in
High-
Dutch
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
curiosity
and
impatience
of
my
master
be
so
great
,
that
he
spend
many
hour
of
his
leisure
to
instruct
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
convince
(
as
he
afterwards
tell
me
)
that
I
must
be
a
Yahoo
;
but
my
teachableness
,
civility
,
and
cleanliness
,
astonish
him
;
which
be
quality
altogether
opposite
to
those
animal
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
most
perplex
about
my
clothe
,
reason
sometimes
with
himself
,
whether
they
be
a
part
of
my
body
:
 
<EOS>
for
I
never
pull
them
off
till
the
family
be
asleep
,
and
get
them
on
before
they
wake
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
be
eager
to
learn
"
whence
<EOS>
I
come
;
how
I
acquire
those
appearance
of
reason
,
which
I
discover
in
all
my
action
;
and
to
know
my
story
from
my
own
mouth
,
which
he
hope
he
should
soon
do
by
the
great
proficiency
I
make
in
learning
and
pronounce
their
word
and
sentence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
to
help
my
memory
,
I
form
all
I
learn
into
the
english
alphabet
,
and
writ
the
word
down
,
with
the
translation
.
 
<EOS>
this
last
,
after
some
time
,
I
venture
to
do
in
my
master
's
presence
.
 
<EOS>
It
cost
me
much
trouble
to
explain
to
him
what
I
be
do
;
for
the
inhabitant
have
not
the
least
idea
of
book
or
literature
.
  
<EOS>
in
about
ten
week
time
,
I
be
able
to
understand
most
of
his
question
;
and
in
three
month
,
could
give
him
some
tolerable
answer
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
extremely
curious
to
know
"
from
what
part
of
the
country
I
come
,
and
how
I
be
teach
to
imitate
a
rational
creature
;
because
the
Yahoos
(
whom
he
see
I
exactly
resemble
in
my
head
,
hand
,
and
face
,
that
be
only
visible
)
,
with
some
appearance
of
cunning
,
and
the
strong
disposition
to
mischief
,
be
observe
to
be
the
most
unteachable
of
all
brute
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
answer
,
"
that
I
come
over
the
sea
,
from
a
far
place
,
with
many
other
of
my
own
kind
,
in
a
great
hollow
vessel
make
of
the
body
of
tree
:
 
that
my
companion
force
me
to
land
on
this
coast
,
and
then
leave
me
to
shift
for
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
with
some
difficulty
,
and
by
the
help
of
many
sign
,
that
I
bring
him
to
understand
me
.
<EOS>
He
reply
,
"
that
I
must
needs
be
mistake
,
or
that
I
say
the
thing
which
be
not
;
"
for
they
have
no
word
in
their
language
to
express
lying
or
falsehood
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
know
it
be
impossible
that
there
could
be
a
country
beyond
the
sea
,
or
that
a
parcel
of
brute
could
move
a
wooden
vessel
whither
they
please
upon
water
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
sure
no
Houyhnhnm
alive
could
make
such
a
vessel
,
nor
would
trust
Yahoos
to
manage
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
word
Houyhnhnm
,
in
their
tongue
,
signify
a
horse
,
and
,
in
its
etymology
,
the
perfection
of
NATURE
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
my
master
,
"
that
I
be
at
a
loss
for
expression
,
but
would
improve
as
fast
as
I
could
;
and
hope
,
in
a
short
time
,
I
should
be
able
to
tell
him
wonder
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
be
pleased
to
direct
his
own
mare
,
his
colt
,
and
foal
,
and
the
servant
of
the
family
,
to
take
all
opportunity
of
instruct
me
;
and
every
day
,
for
two
or
three
hour
,
he
be
at
the
same
pain
himself
.
 
<EOS>
several
horse
and
mare
of
quality
in
the
neighbourhood
come
often
to
our
house
,
upon
the
report
spread
of
"
a
wonderful
Yahoo
,
that
could
speak
like
a
Houyhnhnm
,
and
seem
,
in
his
word
and
action

to
discover
some
glimmering
of
reason
.

"
 
<EOS>
these
delight
to
converse
with
me
:
 
<EOS>
they
put
many
question
,
and
receive
such
answer
as
I
be
able
to
return
.
 
<EOS>
by
all
these
advantage
I
make
so
great
<EOS>
a
progress
,
that
,
in
five
month
from
my
arrival
I
understand
whatever
be
speak
,
and
could
express
myself
tolerably
well
.
  
<EOS>
the
Houyhnhnms
,
who
come
to
visit
my
master
out
of
a
design
of
see
and
talk
with
me
,
could
hardly
believe
me
to
be
a
right
Yahoo
,
because
my
body
have
a
different
covering
from
other
of
my
kind
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
astonish
to
observe
me
without
the
usual
hair
or
skin
,
except
on
my
head
,
face
,
and
hand
;
but
I
discover
that
secret
to
my
master
upon
an
accident
which
happen
about
a
fortnight
before
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
already
tell
the
reader
,
that
every
night
,
when
the
family
be
go
to
bed
,
it
be
my
custom
to
strip
,
and
cover
myself
with
my
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
It
happen
,
one
morning
early
,
that
my
master
send
for
me
by
the
sorrel
nag
,
who
be
his
valet
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
come
I
be
fast
asleep
,
my
clothe
fall
off
on
one
side
,
and
my
shirt
above
my
waist
.
 
<EOS>
I
awake
at
the
noise
he
make
,
and
observe
him
to
deliver
his
message
in
some
disorder
;
after
which
he
go
to
my
master
,
and
in
a
great
fright
give
him
a
very
confused
account
of
what
he
have
see
.
 
<EOS>
this
I
presently
discover
,
for
<EOS>
,
go
as
soon
as
I
be
dressed
to
pay
my
attendance
upon
his
honour
,
he
ask
me
"
the
meaning
of
what
his
servant
have
report
,
that
I
be
not
the
same
thing
when
I
sleep
,
as
I
appear
to
be
at
other
time
;
that
his
vale
assure
him
,
some
part
of
me
be
white
,
some
yellow
,
at
least
not
so
white
,
and
some
brown
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
hitherto
conceal
the
secret
of
my
dress
,
in
order
to
distinguish
myself
,
as
much
as
possible
,
from
that
curse
race
of
Yahoos
;
but
now
I
find
it
in
vain
to
do
so
any
longer
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
I
consider
that
my
clothe
and
shoe
would
soon
wear
out
,
which
already
be
in
a
decline
condition
,
and
must
be
supply
by
some
contrivance
from
the
hide
of
Yahoos
,
or
other
brute
;
whereby
the
whole
secret
would
be
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
tell
my
master
,
"
that
in
the
country
whence
I
come
,
those
of
my
kind
always
cover
their
body
with
the
hair
of
certain
animal
prepare
by
art
,
as
well
for
decency
as
to
avoid
the
inclemency
of
air
,
both
hot
and
cold
;
of
which
,
as
to
my
own
person
,
I
would
give
him
immediate
conviction
,
if
he
please
to
command
me
:
 
only
desire
his
excuse
,
if
I
do
not
expose
those
part
that
nature
teach
us
to
conceal
.
"
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
my
discourse
be
all
very
strange
,
but
especially
the
last
part
;
for
he
could
not
understand
,
why
nature
should
teach
us
to
conceal
what
nature
have
give
;
that
neither
himself
nor
family
be
ashamed
of
any
part
of
their
body
;
but
,
however
,
I
may
do
as
I
please
.
"
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
I
first
unbutton
my
coat
,
and
pull
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
the
same
with
my
waistcoat
.
 
<EOS>
I
draw
off
my
shoe
,
stocking
,
and
breech
.
 
<EOS>
I
let
my
shirt
down
to
my
waist
,
and
draw
up
the
bottom
;
fasten
it
like
a
girdle
about
my
middle
,
to
hide
my
nakedness
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
observe
the
whole
performance
with
great
sign
of
curiosity
and
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
up
all
my
clothe
in
his
pastern
,
one
piece
after
another
,
and
examine
them
diligently
;
he
then
stroke
my
body
very
gently
,
and
look
round
me
several
time
;
after
which
,
he
say
,
it
be
plain
I
must
be
a
perfect
Yahoo
;
but
that
I
differ
very
much
from
the
rest
of
my
specie
in
the
softness
,
whiteness
,
and
smoothness
of
my
skin
;
my
want
of
hair
in
several
part
of
my
body
;
the
shape
and
shortness
of
my
claws
behind
and
before
;
and
my
affectation
of
walk
continually
on
my
two
hinder
foot
.
 
<EOS>
He
desire
to
see
no
more
;
and
give
me
leave
to
put
on
my
clothe
again
,
for
I
be
shudder
with
cold
.
  
<EOS>
I
express
my
uneasiness
at
his
give
me
so
often
the
appellation
of
Yahoo
,
an
odious
animal
,
for
which
I
have
<EOS>
so
utter
a
hatred
and
contempt
:
 
<EOS>
I
beg
he
would
forbear
apply
that
word
to
me
,
and
make
the
same
order
in
his
family
and
among
his
friend
whom
he
suffer
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
request
likewise
,
"
that
the
secret
of
my
have
a
false
covering
to
my
body
,
may
be
know
to
none
but
himself
,
at
least
as
long
as
my
present
clothing
should
last
;
for
as
to
what
the
sorrel
nag
,
his
valet
,
have
observe
,
his
honour
may
command
him
to
conceal
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
all
this
my
master
very
graciously
consent
to
;
and
thus
the
secret
be
keep
till
my
clothe
begin
to
wear
out
,
which
I
be
force
to
supply
by
several
contrivance
that
shall
hereafter
be
mention
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
he
desire
"
I
would
go
on
with
my
utmost
diligence
to
learn
their
language
,
because
he
be
more
astonished
at
my
capacity
for
speech
and
reason
,
than
at
the
figure
of
my
body
,
whether
it
be
cover
or
not
;
"
add
,
"
that
he
wait
with
some
impatience
to
hear
the
wonder
which
I
promise
to
tell
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Thenceforward
he
double
the
pain
he
have
be
at
to
instruct
me
:
he
bring
me
into
all
company
,
and
make
them
treat
me
with
civility
;
"
because
,
"
as
he
tell
them
,
privately
,
"
this
would
put
me
into
good
humour
,
and
make
me
more
divert
.
"
  
<EOS>
every
day
,
when
I
wait
on
him
,
beside
the
trouble
he
be
at
in
teaching
,
he
would
ask
me
several
question
concern
myself
,
which
I
answer
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
by
these
mean
he
have
already
receive
some
general
idea
,
though
very
imperfect
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
tedious
to
relate
the
several
step
by
which
I
advance
to
a
more
regular
conversation
;
but
the
first
account
I
give
of
myself
in
any
order
and
length
be
to
this
purpose
:
  
"
that
I
come
from
a
very
far
country
,
as
I
already
have
attempt
to
tell
him
,
with
about
fifty
more
of
my
own
specie
;
that
we
travel
upon
the
sea
in
a
great
hollow
vessel
make
of
wood
,
and
large
than
his
honour
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
describe
the
ship
to
him
in
the
good
term
I
could
,
and
explain
,
by
the
help
of
my
handkerchief
display
,
how
it
be
drive
forward
by
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
that
upon
a
quarrel
among
us
,
I
be
set
on
shore
on
this
coast
,
where
I
walk
forward
,
without
know
whither
,
till
he
deliver
me
from
the
persecution
of
those
execrable
Yahoos
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
ask
me
,
"
who
make
the
ship
,
and
how
it
be
possible
that
the
Houyhnhnms
of
my
country
would
leave
it
to
the
management
of
brute
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
My
answer
be
,
"
that
I
durst
proceed
no
further
in
my
relation
,
unless
he
would
give
me
his
word
and
honour
that
he
would
not
be
offend
,
and
then
I
would
tell
him
the
wonder
I
have
so
often
promise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
agree
;
and
I
go
on
by
assure
him
,
that
the
ship
be
make
by
creature
like
myself
;
who
,
in
all
the
country
I
have
travel
,
as
well
as
in
my
own
,
be
the
only
govern
rational
animal
;
and
that
upon
my
arrival
hither
,
I
be
as
much
astonished
to
see
the
Houyhnhnms
act
like
rational
being
,
as
he
,
or
his
friend
,
could
be
,
in
find
some
mark
of
reason
in
a
creature
he
be
pleased
to
call
a
Yahoo
;
to
which
I
own
my
resemblance
in
every
part
,
but
could
not
account
for
their
degenerate
and
brutal
nature
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
farther
,
"
that
if
good
fortune
ever
restore
me
to
my
native
country
,
to
relate
my
travel
hither
,
as
I
resolve
to
do
,
everybody
would
believe
,
that
I
say
the
thing
that
be
not
,
that
I
invent
the
story
out
of
my
own
head
;
and
(
with
all
possible
respect
to
himself
,
his
family
,
and
friend
,
and
under
his
promise
of
not
be
offend
)
our
countryman
would
hardly
think
it
probable
that
a
Houyhnhnm
should
be
the
preside
creature
of
a
nation
,
and
a
Yahoo
the
brute
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
Houyhnhnm
's
notion
of
truth
and
falsehood
.
 
<EOS>
the
author
's
discourse
disapprove
by
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
the
author
give
a
more
particular
account
of
himself
,
and
the
accident
of
his
voyage
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
hear
me
with
great
appearance
of
uneasiness
in
his
countenance
;
because
doubt
,
or
not
believe
,
be
so
little
known
in
this
country
,
that
the
inhabitant
can
not
tell
how
to
behave
themselves
under
such
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
remember
,
in
frequent
discourse
with
my
master
concern
the
nature
of
manhood
in
other
part
of
the
world
,
have
occasion
to
talk
of
lying
and
false
representation
,
it
be
with
much
difficulty
that
he
comprehend
what
I
mean
,
although
he
have
otherwise
a
most
acute
judgment
.
 
<EOS>
for
he
argue
thus
:
 
"
that
the
use
of
speech
be
to
make
us
understand
one
another
,
and
to
receive
information
of
fact
;
now
,
if
any
one
say
the
thing
which
be
not
,
these
end
be
defeat
,
because
I
can
not
properly
be
say
to
understand
him
;
and
I
be
so
far
from
receive
information
,
that
he
leave
me
bad
than
in
ignorance
;
for
I
be
lead
to
believe
a
thing
black
,
when
it
be
white
,
and
short
,
when
it
be
long
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
these
be
all
the
notion
he
have
concern
that
faculty
of
lying
,
so
perfectly
well
understand
,
and
so
universally
practise
,
among
human
creature
.
  
<EOS>
to
return
from
this
digression
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
assert
that
the
Yahoos
be
the
only
govern
animal
in
my
country
,
which
my
master
say
be
altogether
past
his
conception
,
he
desire
to
know
,
"
whether
we
have
Houyhnhnms
among
us
,
and
what
be
their
employment
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
"
we
have
great
number
;
that
in
summer
they
graze
in
the
field
,
and
in
winter
be
keep
in
house
with
hay
and
oats
,
where
Yahoo
servant
be
employ
to
rub
their
skin
smooth
,
comb
their
mane
,
pick
their
foot
,
serve
them
with
food
,
and
make
their
bed
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
understand
you
well
,
"
say
my
master
:
 
<EOS>
"
it
be
now
very
plain
,
from
all
you
have
speak
,
that
whatever
share
of
reason
the
Yahoos
pretend
to
,
the
Houyhnhnms
be
your
master
;
I
heartily
wish
our
Yahoos
would
be
so
tractable
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
beg
"
his
honour
would
please
to
excuse
me
from
proceed
any
further
,
because
I
be
very
certain
that
the
account
he
expect
from
me
would
be
highly
displeasing
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
he
insist
in
command
me
to
let
him
know
the
good
and
the
bad
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
"
he
should
be
obey
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
own
"
that
the
Houyhnhnms
among
us
,
whom
we
call
horse
,
be
the
most
generous
and
comely
animal
we
have
;
that
they
excel
in
strength
and
swiftness
;
and
when
they
belong
to
person
of
quality
,
be
employ
in
travel
,
race
,
or
draw
chariot
;
they
be
treat
with
much
kindness
and
care
,
till
they
fall
into
disease
,
or
become
founder
in
the
foot
;
but
then
they
be
sell
,
and
use
to
all
kind
of
drudgery
till
they
die
;
after
which
their
skin
be
strip
,
and
sell
for
what
they
be
worth
,
and
their
body
leave
to
be
devour
by
dog
and
bird
of
prey

<EOS>
but
the
common
race
of
horse
have
not
<EOS>
so
good
fortune
,
be
keep
by
farmer
and
carrier
,
and
other
mean
people
,
who
put
them
to
great
labour
,
and
feed
them
worse

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
describe
,
as
well
as
<EOS>
I
could
,
our
way
of
riding
;
the
shape
and
use
of
a
bridle
,
a
saddle
,
a
spur
,
and
a
whip
;
of
harness
and
wheel
.
 
<EOS>
I
add
,
"
that
we
fasten
plate
of
a
certain
hard
substance
,
call
iron
,
at
the
bottom
of
their
foot
,
to
preserve
their
hoofs
from
be
break
by
the
stony
way
,
on
which
we
often
travel

"
  
<EOS>
My
master
,
after
some
expression
of
great
indignation
,
wonder
"
how
we
dare
to
venture
upon
a
Houyhnhnm
's
back
;
for
he
be
sure
,
that
the
weak
servant
in
his
house
would
be
able
to
shake
off
the
strong
Yahoo
;
or
by
lie
down
and
roll
on
his
back
,
squeeze
the
brute
to
death
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
answer
"
that
our
horse
be
train
up
,
from
three
or
four
year
old
,
to
the
several
use
we
intend
them
for
;
that
if
any
of
them
prove
intolerably
vicious
,
they
be
employ
for
carriage
;
that
they
be
severely
beat
,
while
they
be
young

for
any
mischievous
trick

that
the
male
,
design
for
the
common

riding

draught
,
be
generally
castrate
about
two
year
after
their
birth
,
to
take
down
their
spirit
,
and
make
them
more
tame
and
gentle
;
that
they
be
indeed
sensible
of
reward
and
punishment
;
but
his
honour
would
please
to
consider
,
that
they
have
not
the
least
tincture
of
reason
,
any
more
than
the
Yahoos
in
this
country
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
put
me
to
the
pain
of
many
circumlocution
,
to
give
my
master
a
right
idea
of
what
I
speak
;
for
their
language
do
not
abound
in
variety
of
word
,
because
their
want
and
passion
be
few
than
among
us
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
impossible
to
express
his
noble
resentment
at
our
savage
treatment
of
the
Houyhnhnm
race
;
particularly
after
I
have
explain
the
manner
and
use
of
castrate
horse
among
us
,
to
hinder
them
from
propagate
their
kind
,
and
to
render
them
more
servile
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
if
it
be
possible
there
could
be
any
country
where
Yahoos
alone
be
endue
with
reason
,
they
certainly
must
be
the
governing
animal
;
because
reason
in
time
will
always
prevail
against
brutal
strength
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
consider
the
frame
of
our
body
,
and
especially
of
mine
,
he
think
no
creature
of
equal
bulk
be
so
ill
-
contrive
for
employ
that
reason
in
the
common
office
of
life
;
"
whereupon
he
desire
to
know
whether
those
among
whom
I
live
resemble
me
,
or
the
Yahoos
of
his
country
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
assure
him
,
"
that
I
be
as
well
shape
as
most
of
my
age
;
but
the
young
,
and
the
female
,
be
much
more
soft
and
tender
,
and
the
skin
of
the
latter
generally
as
white
as
milk
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
I
differ
indeed
from
other
Yahoos
,
be
much
more
cleanly
,
and
not
altogether
so
deform
;
but
,
in
point
of
real
advantage
,
he
think
I
differ
for
the
bad
:
 
that
my
nail
be
of
no
use
either
to
my
fore
or
hinder
foot
;
as
to
my
fore
foot
,
he
could
not
properly
call
them
by
that
name
,
for
he
never
observe
me
to
walk
upon
them
;
that
they
be
too
soft
to
bear
the
ground
;
that
I
generally
go
with
them
uncover
;
neither
be
the
covering
I
sometimes
wear
on
them
of
the
same
shape
,
or
so
strong
as
that
on
my
foot
behind
:
 
that
I
could
not
walk
with
any
security
,
<EOS>
for
if
either
of
my
hinder
foot
slip
,
I
must
inevitably
fail
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
begin
to
find
fault
with
other
part
of
my
body
:
 
<EOS>
"
the
flatness
of
my
face
,
the
prominence
of
my
nose
,
mine
eye
place
directly
in
front
,
so
that
I
could
not
look
on
either
side
without
turn
my
head
:
 
that
I
be
not
able
to
feed
myself
,
without
lift
one
of
my
fore
-
foot
to
my
mouth
:
and
therefore
nature
have
place
those
joint
to
answer
that
necessity
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
not
what
could
be
the
use
of
those
several
cleft
and
division
in
my
foot
behind
;
that
these
be
too
soft
to
bear
the
hardness
and
sharpness
of
stone
,
without
a
covering
make
from
the
skin
of
some
other
brute
;
that
my
whole
body
want
a
fence
against
heat
and
cold
,
which
I
be
force
to
put
on
and
off
every
day
,
with
tediousness
and
trouble
:
 
and
lastly
,
that
he
observe
every
animal
in
this
country
naturally
to
abhor
the
Yahoos
,
whom
the
weak
avoid
,
and
the
strong
drive
from
them
.
<EOS>
so
that
,
suppose
us
to
have
the
gift
of
reason
,
he
could
not
see
how
it
be
possible
to
cure
that
natural
antipathy
,
which
every
creature
discover
against
us
;
nor
consequently
how
we
could
tame
and
render
them
serviceable
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
would
,
"
as
he
say
,
"
debate
the
matter
no
farther
,
because
he
be
more
desirous
to
know
my
own
story
,
the
country
where
I
be
bear
,
and
the
several
action
and
event
of
my
life
,
before
I
come
hither
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
assure
him
,
"
how
extremely
desirous
I
be
that
he
should
be
satisfied
on
every
point
;
but
I
doubt
much
,
whether
it
would
be
possible
for
me
to
explain
myself
on
several
subject
,
whereof
his
honour
could
have
no
conception
;
because
I
see
nothing
in
his
country
to
which
I
could
resemble
them
;
that
,
however
,
I
would
do
my
good
,
and
strive
to
express
myself
by
similitude
,
humbly
desire
his
assistance
when
I
want
proper
word
;
"
which
he
be
pleased
to
promise
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
my
birth
be
of
honest
parent
,
in
an
island
call
England
;
which
be
remote
from
his
country

as
many
day
'
journey
as
the
strong
of
his
honour

servant
could
travel
in
the
annual
course

that
I
be
breed
a
surgeon
,
whose
trade
it
be
to
cure
wound
and
hurt
in

get
by
accident

violence

that
my
country
be

by
a
female

whom
we
call
queen
;
that
I
leave
it
to
get
rich
,
whereby
I
may
maintain
myself
and
family
,
when
I
should
return

that
,
in

last
voyage

I
be
commander
of
the
ship
,
and
have
about
fifty
Yahoos
under
me
,
many
of
which
die
at
sea

I
be
force
to
supply
them
by
other
pick
out

<EOS>
here
my

interpose

me

"
how
I

persuade
stranger

out

<EOS>
I

,
"
they

of
desperate
fortune

force
to
fly
from
the

of
their

some

"
  
<EOS>
during
this
discourse
,
my
master
be
pleased
to
interrupt
me
several
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
make
use
of
many
circumlocution
in
describe
to
him
the
nature
of
the
several
crime
for
which
most
of
our
crew
have
be
force

fly

country

<EOS>
this
labour
take
up
several
day
'
conversation
,
before
he
be
able
to
comprehend
me
.
<EOS>
He
be
wholly
at
a
loss
to
know
what
could
be
the
use
or
necessity
of
practise
those
vice
.
 
<EOS>
to
clear
up
which
,
I
endeavour
to
give
some
idea
of
the
desire
of
power
and
rich
;
of
the
terrible
effect
of
lust
,
intemperance
,
malice
,
and
envy

<EOS>
all
this
I
be
force
to
define
and
describe
by
put
case
and
make
supposition

<EOS>
after
which
,
like
one
whose
imagination
be
strike
with
something
never
see
or
hear
of
before
,
he
would
lift
up
his
eye
with
amazement

indignation

<EOS>
power
,
government
,
war
,
law
,
punishment
,
and
a
thousand
other
thing
,
have
no
term
wherein
that
language
could
express
them
,
which
make
the
difficulty
almost
insuperable
,
to
give
my
master
any
conception
of
what
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
but
be
of
an
excellent
understanding
,
much
improve
by
contemplation
and
converse
<EOS>
,
he
at
last
arrive
at
a
competent
knowledge
of
what
human
nature
,
in
our
part
of
the
world
,
be
capable
to
perform
,
and
desire
I
would
give
him
some
particular
account
of
that
land
which
we
call
Europe
,
but
especially
of
my
own
country
.
   
<EOS>
the
author
at
his
master
's
command
,
inform
him
of
the
state
of
England
.
<EOS>
the
cause
of
war
among
the
prince
of
Europe
.
 
<EOS>
the
author
begin
to
explain
the
english
constitution
.
 
<EOS>
the
reader
may
please
to
observe
,
that
the
follow
extract
of
many
conversation
I
have
with
my
master
,
contain
a
summary
of
the
most
material
point
which
be
discourse
at
several
time
for
above
two
year
;
his
honour
often
desire
full
satisfaction
,
as
I
farther
improve
in
the
Houyhnhnm
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
I
lay
before
him
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
the
whole
state
of
Europe
;
I
discourse
of
trade
and
manufacture
,
of
art
and
science
;
and
the
answer
I
give
to
all
the
question
he
make
,
as
they
arise
upon
several
subject
,
be
a
fund
of
conversation
not
to
be
exhaust
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
shall
here
only
set
down
the
substance
of
what
pass
between
us
concern
my
own
country
,
reduce
it
in
order
as
well
as
I
can
,
without
any
regard
to
time
or
other
circumstance
,
while
I
strictly
adhere
to
truth
.
 
<EOS>
My
only
concern
be
,
that
I
shall
hardly
be
able
to
do
justice
to
my
master
's
argument
and
expression
,
which
must
needs
suffer
by
my
want
of
capacity
,
as
well
as
by
a
translation
into
our
barbarous
English
.
  
<EOS>
in
obedience
,
therefore
,
to
his
honour
's
command
,
I
relate
to
him
the
Revolution
under
the
Prince
of
Orange
;
the
long
war
with
France
,
enter
into
by
the
say
prince
,
and
renew
by
his
successor
,
the
present
queen
,
wherein
the
great
power
of
Christendom
be
engage
,
and
which
still
continue
:
 
<EOS>
I
compute
,
at
his
request
,
"
that
about
a
million
of
Yahoos
may
have
be
kill
in
the
whole
progress
of
it
;
and
perhaps
a
hundred
or
more
city
take
,
and
five
time
as
many
ship
burn
or
sink
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
ask
me
,
"
what
be
the
usual
cause
or
motive
that
make
one
country
go
to
war
with
another
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
answer
"
they
be
innumerable
;
but
I
should
only
mention
a
few
of
the
chief
.
<EOS>
sometimes
the
ambition
of
prince
,
who
never
think
they
have
land
or
people
enough
to
govern
;
sometimes
the
corruption
of
minister
,
who
engage
their
master
in
a
war
,
in
order
to
stifle
or
divert
the
clamour
of
the
subject
against
their
evil
administration
.
<EOS>
difference
in
opinion
have
cost
many
million
of
life
:
 
for
instance
,
whether
flesh
be
bread
,
or
bread
be
flesh
;
whether
the
juice
of
a
certain
berry
be
blood
or
wine
;
whether
whistle
be
a
vice
or
a
virtue
;
whether
it
be
well
to
kiss
a
post
,
or
throw
it
into
the
fire
;
what
be
the
good
colour
for
a
coat
,
whether
black
,
white
,
red
,
or
gray
;
and
whether
it
should
be
long
or
short
,
narrow
or
wide
,
dirty
or
clean
;
with
many
more
.
 
<EOS>
neither
be
any
war
so
furious
and
bloody
,
or
of
so
long
a
continuance
,
as
those
occasion
by
difference
in
opinion
,
especially
if
it
be
in
thing
indifferent
.
  
<EOS>
"
sometimes
the
quarrel
between
two
prince
be
to
decide
which
of
them
shall
dispossess
a
third
of
his
dominion
,
where
neither
of
them
pretend
to
any
right
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
one
prince
quarrel
with
another
for
fear
the
other
should
quarrel
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
a
war
be
enter
upon
,
because
the
enemy
be
too
strong
;
and
sometimes
,
because
he
be
too
weak
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
our
neighbour
want
the
thing
which
we
have
,
or
have
the
thing
which
we
want
,
and
we
both
fight
,
till
they
take
ours
,
or
give
us
theirs
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
justifiable
cause
of
a
war
,
to
invade
a
country
after
the
people
have
be
waste
by
famine
,
destroy
by
pestilence
,
or
embroil
by
faction
among
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
justifiable
to
enter
into
war
against
our
near
ally
,
when
one
of
his
town
lie
convenient
for
us
,
or
a
territory
of
land
,
that
would
render
our
dominion
round
and
complete
.
 
<EOS>
if
a
prince
send
force
into
a
nation
,
where
the
people
be
poor
and
ignorant
,
he
may
lawfully
put
half
of
them
to
death
,
and
make
slave
of
the
rest
,
in
order
to
civilize
and
reduce
them
from
their
barbarous
way
of
living
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
kingly
,
honourable
,
and
frequent
practice
,
when
one
prince
desire
the
assistance
of
another
,
to
secure
him
against
an
invasion
,
that
the
assistant
,
when
he
have
drive
out
the
invader
,
should
seize
on
the
dominion
himself
,
and
kill
,
imprison
,
or
banish
,
the
prince
he
come
to
relieve
.
 
<EOS>
alliance
by
blood
,
or
marriage
,
be
a
frequent
cause
of
war
between
prince
;
and
the
nearer
the
kindred
be
,
the
great
their
disposition
to
quarrel
;
poor
nation
be
hungry

and
rich
nation
be
proud

and
pride
and
hunger
will
ever
be
at

<EOS>
for
these
reason
,
the
trade
of
a
soldier
be
hold
the
most
honourable
of
all
other
;
because
a
soldier
be
a
Yahoo
hire
to
kill
,
in
cold
blood
,
as
many
of
his

never
offend
him

as
possibly
he
can

<EOS>
"
there
be
likewise
a
kind
of
beggarly
prince
in
Europe

not
able
to
make
war
by
themselves

who
hire
out
their

to
rich
nation

for
so
much
a

they

three

it

their

such
be
those
in

northern

<EOS>
"
what
you
have

say
my

"
upon
the
subject
of
war
,
do
indeed
discover
most
admirably
the
effect

you
pretend

however

it
be
happy
that

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
go
on
to
more
particular
,
when
my
master
command
me
silence
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
whoever
understand
the
nature
of
Yahoos
,
may
easily
believe
it
possible
for
so
vile
an
animal
to
be
capable
of
every
action
I
have
name
,
if
their
strength
and
cunning
equal
their
malice
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
my
discourse
have
increase
his
abhorrence
of
the
whole
specie
,
so
he
find
it
give
him
a
disturbance
in
his
mind
to
which
he
be
wholly
a
stranger
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
his
ear
,
be
use
to
such
abominable
word
,
may
,
by
degree
,
admit
them
with
less
detestation
:
 
that
although
he
hate
the
Yahoos
of
this
country
,
yet
he
no
more
blame
them
for
their
odious
quality
,
than
he
do
a
gnnayh
(
a
bird
of
prey
)
for
its
cruelty
,
or
a
sharp
stone
for
cut
his
hoof
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
a
creature
pretend
to
reason
could
be
capable
of
such
enormity
,
he
dread
lest
the
corruption
of
that
faculty
may
be
bad
than
brutality
itself
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
therefore
confident
,
that
,
instead
of
reason
we
be
only
possess
of
some
quality
fit
to
increase
our
natural
vice
;
as
the
reflection
from
a
troubled
stream
return
the
image
of
an
ill
shapen
body
,
not
only
large
but
more
distorted
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
add
,
"
that
he
have
hear
too
much
upon
the
subject
of
war
,
both
in
this
and
some
former
discourse
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
another
point
,
which
a
little
perplex
him
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
inform
him
,
that
some
of
our
crew
leave
their
country
on
account
of
be
ruin
by
law
;
that
I
have
already
explain
the
meaning
of
the
word
;
but
he
be
at
a
loss
how
it
should
come
to
pass
,
that
the
law
,
which
be
intend
for
every
man
's
preservation
,
should
be
any
man
's
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
he
desire
to
be
further
satisfied
what
I
mean
by
law
,
and
the
dispenser
thereof
,
accord
to
the
present
practice
in
my
own
country
;
because
he
think
nature
and
reason
be
sufficient
guide
for
a
reasonable
animal
,
as
we
pretend
to
be
,
in
show
us
what
he
ought
to
do
,
and
what
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
assure
his
honour
,
"
that
the
law
be
a
science
in
which
I
have
not
much
converse
,
further
than
by
employ
advocate
,
in
vain
,
upon
some
injustice
that
have
be
do
me
:
 
however
,
I
would
give
him
all
the
satisfaction
I
be
able
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
there
be
a
society
of
man
among
us
,
breed
up
from
their
youth
in
the
art
of
proving
,
by
word
multiply
for
the
purpose
,
that
white
be
black
,
and
black
be
white
,
accord
as
they
be
pay
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
society
all
the
rest
of
the
people
be
slave
.
 
<EOS>
for
example
,
if
my
neighbour
have
a
mind
to
my
cow
,
he
have
a
lawyer
to
prove
that
he
ought
to
have
my
cow
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
then
hire
another
to
defend
my
right
<EOS>
,
it
be
against
all
rule
of
law
that
any
man
should
be
allow
to
speak
for
himself
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
in
this
case
,
I
,
who
be
the
right
owner
,
lie
under
two
great
disadvantage
:
<EOS>
first
,
my
lawyer
,
be
practise
almost
from
his
cradle
in
defend
falsehood
,
be
quite
out
of
his
element
when
he
would
be
an
advocate
for
justice
,
which
be
an
unnatural
office
he
always
attempt
with
great
awkwardness
,
if
not
with
ill
-
will
.
 
<EOS>
the
second
disadvantage
be
,
that
my
lawyer
must
proceed
with
great
caution
,
or
else
he
will
be
reprimand
by
the
judge
,
and
abhor
by
his
brother
,
as
one
that
would
lessen
the
practice
of
the
law
.
 
<EOS>
and
therefore
I
have
<EOS>
but
two
method
to
preserve
my
cow
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
be
,
to
gain
over
my
adversary
's
lawyer
with
a
double
fee
,
who
will
then
betray
his
client
by
insinuate
that
he
hath
justice
on
his
side
.
<EOS>
the
second
way
be
for
my
lawyer
to
make
my
cause
appear
as
unjust
as
he
can
,
by
allow
the
cow
to
belong
to
my
adversary
:
 
and
this
,
if
it
be
skilfully
do
,
will
certainly
bespeak
the
favour
of
the
bench
.
 
<EOS>
now
your
honour
be
to
know
,
that
these
judge
be
person
appoint
to
decide
all
controversy
of
property
,
as
well
as
for
the
trial
of
criminal
,
and
pick
out
from
the
most
dexterous
lawyer
,
who
be
grow
old
or
lazy
;
and
have
be
bias
all
their
life
against
truth
and
equity
,
lie
under
such
a
fatal
necessity
of
favour
fraud
,
perjury
,
and
oppression
,
that
I
have
know
some
of
them
refuse
a
large
bribe
from
the
side
where
justice
lie
,
rather
than
injure
the
faculty
,
by
do
any
thing
unbecome
their
nature
or
their
office
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
maxim
among
these
lawyer
that
whatever
have
be
do
before
,
may
legally
be
do
again
:
 
and
therefore
they
take
special
care
to
record
all
the
decision
formerly
make
against
common
justice
,
and
the
general
reason
of
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
these
,
under
the
name
of
precedent
,
they
produce
as
authority
to
justify
the
most
iniquitous
opinion
;
and
the
judge
never
fail
of
direct
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
pleading
,
they
studiously
avoid
enter
into
the
merit
of
the
cause
;
but
be
loud
,
violent
,
and
tedious
,
in
dwell
upon
all
circumstance
which
be
not
to
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
for
instance
,
in
the
case
already
mention
;
they
never
desire
to
know
what
claim
or
title
my
adversary
have
to
my
cow
;
but
whether
the
say
cow
be
red
or
black
;
her
horn
long
or
short
;
whether
the
field
I
graze
her
in
be
round
or
square
;
whether
she
be
milk
at
home
or
abroad
;
what
disease
she
be
subject
to
,
and
the
like
;
after
which
they
consult
precedent
,
adjourn
the
cause
from
time
to
time
,
and
in
ten
,
twenty
,
or
thirty
year
,
come
to
an
issue
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
likewise
to
be
observe
,
that
this
society
have
a
peculiar
can
not
and
jargon
of
their
own
,
that
no
other
mortal
can
understand
,
and
wherein
all
their
law
be
write
,
which
they
take
special
care
to
multiply
;
whereby
they
have
wholly
confound
the
very
essence
of
truth
and
falsehood
,
of
right
and
wrong
;
so
that
it
will
take
thirty
year
to
decide
,
whether
the
field
leave
me
by
my
ancestor
for
six
generation
belong
to
me
,
or
to
a
stranger
three
hundred
mile
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
the
trial
of
person
accuse
for
crime
against
the
state
,
the
method
be
much
more
short
and
commendable
:
 
the
judge
first
send
to
sound
the
disposition
of
those
in
power
,
after
which
he
can
easily
hang
or
save
a
criminal
,
strictly
preserve
all
due
form
of
law
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
my
master
interpose
,
say
,
"
it
be
a
pity
,
that
creature
endow
with
such
prodigious
ability
of
mind
,
as
these
lawyer
,
by
the
description
I
give
of
them
,
must
certainly
be
,
<EOS>
be
not
rather
encourage
to
be
instructor
of
other
in
wisdom
and
knowledge
.
"
 
<EOS>
in
answer
to
which
I
assure
his
honour
,
"
that
in
all
point
out
of
their
own
trade
,
they
be
usually
the
most
ignorant
and
stupid
generation
among
us
,
the
most
despicable
in
common
conversation
,
avow
enemy
to
all
knowledge
and
learning
,
and
equally
disposed
to
pervert
the
general
reason
of
mankind
in
every
other
subject
of
discourse
as
in
that
of
their
own
profession
.
"
   
<EOS>
a
continuation
of
the
state
of
England
under
Queen
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
the
character
of
a
first
minister
of
state
in
european
court
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
be
yet
wholly
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
motive
could
incite
this
race
of
lawyer
to
perplex
,
disquiet
,
and
weary
themselves
,
and
engage
in
a
confederacy
of
injustice
,
merely
for
the
sake
of
injure
their
fellow
-
animal
;
neither
could
he
comprehend
what
I
mean
in
say
,
they
do
it
for
hire
.
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
I
be
at
much
pain
to
describe
to
him
the
use
of
money
,
the
material
it
be
make
of
,
and
the
value
of
the
metal
;
"
that
when
a
Yahoo
have
get
a
great
store
of
this
precious
substance
,
he
be
able
to
purchase
whatever
he
have
a
mind
to
;
the
fine
clothing
,
the
noble
house
,
great
tract
of
land
,
the
most
costly
meat
and
drink
,
and
have
his
choice
of
the
most
beautiful
female
.
<EOS>
therefore
since
money
alone
be
able
to
perform
all
these
feat
,
our
Yahoos
think
they
could
never
have
enough
of
it
to
spend
,
or
to
save
,
as
they
find
themselves
inclined
,
from
their
natural
bent
either
to
profusion
or
avarice
;
that
the
rich
man
enjoy
the
fruit
of
the
poor
man
's
labour
,
and
the
latter
be
a
thousand
to
one
in
proportion
to
the
former
;
that
the
bulk
of
our
people
be
force
to
live
miserably
,
by
labour
every
day
for
small
wage
,
to
make
a
few
live
plentifully
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
enlarge
myself
much
on
these
,
and
many
other
particular
to
the
same
purpose
;
but
his
honour
be
still
to
seek
;
for
he
go
upon
a
supposition
,
that
all
animal
have
a
title
to
their
share
in
the
production
of
the
earth
,
and
especially
those
who
preside
over
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
he
desire
I
would
let
him
know
,
"
what
these
costly
meat
be
,
and
how
any
of
us
happen
to
want
them
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
I
enumerate
as
many
sort
as
come
into
my
head
,
with
the
various
method
of
dress
them
,
which
could
not
be
do
without
send
vessel
by
sea
to
every
part
of
the
world
,
as
well
for
liquor
to
drink
as
for
sauce
and
innumerable
other
convenience
.
<EOS>
I
assure
him
"
that
this
whole
globe
of
earth
must
be
at
least
three
time
go
round
before
one
of
our
well
female
Yahoos
could
get
her
breakfast
,
or
a
cup
to
put
it
in
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
say
"
that
must
need
be
a
miserable
country
which
can
not
furnish
food
for
its
own
inhabitant
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
he
chiefly
wonder
at
be
,
<EOS>
how
such
vast
tract
of
ground
as
I
describe
should
be
wholly
without
fresh
water
,
and
the
people
put
to
the
necessity
of
send
over
the
sea
for
drink
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
reply
"
that
England
(
the
dear
place
of
my
nativity
)
be
compute
to
produce
three
time
the
quantity
of
food
more
than
its
inhabitant
be
able
to
consume
,
as
well
as
liquor
extract
from
grain
,
or
press
out
of
the
fruit
of
certain
tree
,
which
make
excellent
drink
,
and
the
same
proportion
in
every
other
convenience
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
in
order
to
feed
the
luxury
and
intemperance
of
the
male
,
and
the
vanity
of
the
female
,
we
send
away
the
great
part
of
our
necessary
thing
to
other
country
,
whence
<EOS>
,
in
return
,
we
bring
the
material
of
disease
,
folly
,
and
vice
,
to
spend
among
ourselves

<EOS>
hence
it
follow
of
necessity
,
that
vast
number
of
our
people
be
compel
to
seek

every

"
that
wine
be
not
import
among

from

supply
the
want

because

liquid

be

mention

<EOS>

tell
him

"
that
a
first

chief
minister

be
the
person

describe

be
the
creature
wholly
exempt

joy

grief

love

hatred

pity

anger

at

make
use
of
no
other
passion

a
violent
desire
of
wealth

power

title

that
he
apply
his
word
to
all
use
,
except
to
the
indication

his
mind

that
he
never
tell
a
truth

with
an
intent
that
you
should
take
it
for
a
lie
;
nor
a
lie
,
but
with
a
design
that
you
should
take
it
for
a
truth
;
that
those
he
speak
bad
of
behind
their
back
be
in
the
sure
way
of
preferment
;

whenever
he
begin
to
praise
you
to
other

to
yourself

you
be
from
that
day
forlorn

the
bad

you
can
receive

it

retire

be
three
method

be

by
know
how

with
prudence

<EOS>
the
second
,
by
betray

undermine
his
predecessor

the
third
be
,
by
a
furious
zeal
,
in
public
assembly
,
against
the
corruption
's
of
the
court
.
 
<EOS>
but
a
wise
prince
would
rather
choose
to
employ
those
who
practise
the
last
of
these
method
;
because
such
zealot
prove
always
the
most
obsequious
and
subservient
to
the
will
and
passion
of
their
master
.
 
<EOS>
that
these
minister
,
have
all
employment
at
their
disposal
,
preserve
themselves
in
power
,
by
bribe
the
majority
of
a
senate
or
great
council
;
and
at
last
,
by
an
expedient
,
call
an
act
of
indemnity
"
<EOS>
(
whereof
I
describe
the
nature
to
him
)
,
"
they
secure
themselves
from
after

reckoning
,

retire
from
the
public
laden

spoil

<EOS>
"
the
palace

a
chief
minister
be
a
seminary

up

become
minister

district

learn

excel

the
three
principal
ingredient

of
insolence

lying
,
and
bribery

<EOS>
accordingly
,
they
have
a
subaltern
court
pay
to
them
by
person
of
the
good
rank

sometimes
by
the
force

dexterity

impudence

arrive

through
several
gradation

one
day

have
hear

mention
the
nobility

be

a
compliment

that

I
must
have
be
bear
of

noble
family

I
far
exceed
in
shape

colour

and
cleanliness

all
the
Yahoos

I
seem

fail
in
strength

agility

must
be
impute

my
different
way
of
live
from
those
other
brute

besides
I
be
not
only
endow
with
the
faculty
of
speech

likewise
with
some
rudiment
of
reason

to
a
degree
that
,
with
all
his
acquaintance

I
pass
for
a
prodigy

He
make
me
observe

that
among
the
Houyhnhnms
,
the
white
,
the
sorrel

the
iron

gray
,
be
not
so
exactly
shape
as
the

gray
,
and
the
black

nor
bear
with
equal
talent
of
mind

a
capacity
to
improve
them

and
therefore
continue
always
in
the
condition
of
servant

without
ever
aspire
to
match
out
of
their
own
race

which
in

would
be
reckon
monstrous

unnatural

"
  
<EOS>
I
make
his
honour
my
most
humble
acknowledgment
for
the
good
opinion
he
be
pleased
to
conceive
of
me
,
but
assure
him
at
the
same
time
,
"
that
my
birth
be
of
the
low
sort

have
be
bear
of
plain
honest
parent

who
be
just
able
to
give
me
a
tolerable
education
;
that
nobility
,
among
us
,
be
altogether
a
different
thing
from
the
idea
he
have
of
it
;
that
our
young
nobleman
be
breed
from
their
childhood
in
idleness
and
luxury
;
that
,
as
soon
as
year
will
permit
,
they
consume
their
vigour
,
and
contract
odious
disease
among
lewd
female
;
and
when
their
fortune
be
almost
ruin
,
they
marry
some
woman
of
mean
birth
,
disagreeable
person
,
and
unsound
constitution
(
merely
for
the
sake
of
money
)
,
whom
they
hate
and
despise
.
 
<EOS>
that
the
production
of
such
marriage
be
generally
scrofulous
,
rickety
,
or
deform
child
;
by
which
mean
the
family
seldom
continue
above
three
generation
,
unless
the
wife
take
care
to
provide
a
healthy
father
,
among
her
neighbour
or
domestic
,
in
order
to
improve
and
continue
the
breed

<EOS>
that
a
weak
disease
body
,
a
meagre
countenance
,
and
sallow
complexion
,
be
the
true
mark
of
noble
blood
;
and
a
healthy
robust
appearance
be
so
disgraceful
in
a
man
of
quality
,
that
the
world
conclude
his
real
father
to
have
be
a
groom

a
coachman

the
imperfection

ignorance

may
be
dispose
to
wonder
how
I
could
prevail
on
myself
to
give
so
free
a
representation

specie

among
a
race
of
mortal
who
be
already
too
apt
to
conceive
the
vile
opinion
of

from
that
entire
congruity
between
me
and

<EOS>
but
I
must
freely
confess
,
that
the
many
virtue
of
those
excellent
quadruped
,
place
in
opposite
view
to
human
corruption

have
so
far
open
my
eye

enlarge
my
understanding

that
I
begin
to
view
the
action

passion
of
man
in
a
very
different
light
,
and
to
think
the
honour
of
my
own
kind
not
worth
managing
;
which
,
besides
,
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
do
,
before
a
person
of
so
acute
a
judgment
as
my
master
,
who
daily
convince
me
of
a
thousand
fault
in
myself
,
whereof
I
have
not
the
least
perception
before
,
and
which
,
with
us
,
would
never
be
number
even
among

infirmity

<EOS>
I
have
likewise
learn
,
from
his
example
,
an
utter
detestation
of
all
falsehood
or
disguise
;
and
truth
appear
so
amiable
to
me
,
that
I
determine
upon
sacrifice
every
thing
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
let
me
deal
so
candidly
with
the
reader
as
to
confess
that
there
be
yet
a
much
strong
motive
for
the
freedom
I
take
in
my
representation
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
be
a
year
in
this
country
before
I
contract
such
a
love
and
veneration
for
the
inhabitant
<EOS>
,
that
I
enter
on
a
firm
resolution
never
to
return
to
humankind
,
but
to
pass
the
rest
of
my
life
among
these
admirable
Houyhnhnms
,
in
the
contemplation
and
practice
of
every
virtue
,
where
I
could
have
no
example
or
incitement
to
vice

<EOS>
but
it
be
decree
by
fortune
,
my
perpetual
enemy
,
<EOS>
that
so
great
a
felicity
should
not
fall
to
my
share

<EOS>
however
,
it
be
now
some
comfort
to
reflect
,
that
in
what
I
say
of
my
countryman
,
I
extenuate
their
fault
as
much
as
I
durst
before
so
strict
an
examiner
;
and
upon
every
article
give
as
favourable
a
turn
as
the
matter
would
bear
.
<EOS>
for
,
indeed
,
who
be
there
alive
that
will
not
be
sway
by
his
bias
and
partiality
to
the
place
of
his

have
relate
the
substance

several
conversation
I
have
with
my
master
during
the
great
part
of
the
time
I
have
the
honour
to
be
in
his
service
;
but
have
,
indeed
,
for
brevity
sake
,
omit
much
more
than
be
here
set
down

<EOS>
when
I
have
answer
all
his
question
,
and
his
curiosity
seem
to
be
fully
satisfied
,
he
send
for
me
one
morning
early
,
and
command
me
to
sit
down
at
some
distance
(

honour
which
he
have
never

have
be
very
seriously
consider
my
whole
story

far
as
it
relate
both
to
myself

he
look
upon
us
as
a
sort
of
animal

to
whose
share
,
by
what
accident
he
could
not
conjecture
,
some
small
pittance
of
reason
have
fall
,
whereof
we
make
no
other
use

than
by
its
assistance
,
to
aggravate
our
natural
corruption
,
and
to
acquire
new
one
,
which
nature
have
not
give
us
;
that
we
disarm
ourselves
of
the
few
ability
she
have
bestow
;
have
be
very
successful
in
multiply
our
original
want
,
and
seem
to
spend
our
whole
life
in
vain
endeavour
to
supply
them
by
our
own
invention

that
,
as
to
myself
,
it
be
manifest
I
have
neither
the
strength
nor
agility
of
a
common
Yahoo

that
I
walk
infirmly
on
my
hinder
foot

have
find
out
a
contrivance
to
make
my
claws
of
no
use
or
defence

and
to
remove
the
hair
from
my
chin
,
which
be
intend
as
a
shelter
from
the
sun

the
weather
:
 
lastly
,
that
I
could
neither
run

<EOS>
"
that
our
institution
of
government
and
law
be
plainly
owe
to
our
gross
defect
in
reason
,
and
by
consequence
in
virtue
;
because
reason
alone
be
sufficient
to
govern
a
rational
creature
;
which
be
,
therefore
,
a
character
we
have
no
pretence
to
challenge
,
even
from
the
account
I
have
give
of
my
own
people
;
although
he
manifestly
perceive
,
that
,
in
order
to
favour
them
,
I
have
conceal
many
particular
,
and
often
say
the
thing
which
be
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
the
more
confirmed
in
this
opinion
,
because
,
he
observe
,
that
as
I
agree
in
every
feature
of
my
body
with
other
Yahoos
,
except
where
it
be
to
my
real
disadvantage
in
point
of
strength
,
speed
,
and
activity
,
the
shortness
of
my
claws
,
and
some
other
particular
where
nature
have
no
part
;
so
from
the
representation
I
have
give
him
of
our
life
,
our
manner
,
and
our
action
,
he
find
as
near
a
resemblance
in
the
disposition
of
our
mind
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
the
Yahoos
be
know
to
hate
one
another
,
more
than
they
do
any
different
specie
of
animal
;
and
the
reason
usually
assign
be
,
the
odiousness
of
their
own
shape
,
which
all
could
see
in
the
rest
,
but
not
in
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
therefore
begin
to
think
it
not
unwise
in
us
to
cover
our
body
,
and
by
that
invention
conceal
many
of
our
deformity
from
each
other
,
which
would
else
be
hardly
supportable
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
now
find
he
have
be
mistaken
,
and
that
the
dissension
of
those
brute
in
his
country
be
owe
to
the
same
cause
with
ours
,
as
I
have
describe
them
.
 
<EOS>
for
if
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
throw
among
five
Yahoos
as
much
food
as
would
be
sufficient
for
fifty
,
they
will
,
instead
of
eat
peaceably
,
fall
together
by
the
ear
,
each
single
one
impatient
to
have
all
to
itself
;
and
therefore
a
servant
be
usually
employ
to
stand
by
while
they
be
feed
abroad
,
and
those
keep
at
home
be
tie
at
a
distance
from
each
other
:
 
that
if
a
cow
die
of
age
or
accident
,
before
a
Houyhnhnm
could
secure
it
for
his
own
Yahoos
,
those
in
the
neighbourhood
would
come
in
herd
to
seize
it
,
and
then
would
ensue
such
a
battle
as
I
have
describe
,
with
terrible
wound
make
by
their
claws
on
both
side
,
although
they
seldom
be
able
to
kill
one
another
,
for
want
of
such
convenient
instrument
of
death
as
we
have
invent
.
 
<EOS>
at
other
time
,
the
like
battle
have
be
fight
between
the
Yahoos
of
several
neighbourhood
,
without
any
visible
cause
;
those
of
one
district
watch
all
opportunity
to
surprise
the
next
,
before
they
be
prepared
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
they
find
their
project
have
miscarry
,
they
return
home
,
and
,
for
want
of
enemy
,
engage
in
what
I
call
a
civil
war
among
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
in
some
field
of
his
country
there
be
certain
shine
stone
of
several
colour
,
whereof
the
Yahoos
be
violently
fond
:
and
when
part
of
these
stone
be
fix
in
the
earth
,
as
it
sometimes
happen
,
they
will
dig
with
their
claws
for
whole
day
to
get
them
out
;
then
carry
them
away
,
and
hide
them
by
heap
in
their
kennel
;
but
still
look
round
with
great
caution
,
for
fear
their
comrade
should
find
out
their
treasure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
My
master
say
,
"
he
could
never
discover
the
reason
of
this
unnatural
appetite
,
or
how
these
stone
could
be
of
any
use
to
a
Yahoo
;
but
now
he
believe
it
may
proceed
from
the
same
principle
of
avarice
which
I
have
ascribe
to
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
have
once
,
by
way
of
experiment
,
privately
remove
a
heap
of
these
stone
from
the
place
where
one
of
his
Yahoos
have
bury
it
;
whereupon
the
sordid
animal
,
miss
his
treasure
,
by
his
loud
lamenting
bring
the
whole
herd
to
the
place
<EOS>
,
there
miserably
howl
,
then
fall
to
bite
and
tear
the
rest
,
begin
to
pine
away
,
would
neither
eat
,
nor
sleep
,
nor
work
,
till
he
order
a
servant
privately
to
convey
the
stone
into
the
same
hole
,
and
hide
them
as
before
;
which
,
when
his
Yahoo
have
find
,
he
presently
recover
his
spirit
and
good
humour
,
but
take
good
care
to
remove
them
to
a
well
hiding
place
,
and
have
ever
since
be
a
very
serviceable
brute
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
master
further
assure
me
,
which
I
also
observe
myself
,
"
that
in
the
field
where
the
shine
stone
abound
,
the
fierce
and
most
frequent
battle
be
fight
,
occasion
by
perpetual
inroad
of
the
neighbour
Yahoos
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
it
be
common
,
when
two
Yahoos
discover
such
a
stone
in
a
field
,
and
be
contend
which
of
them
should
be
the
proprietor
,
a
third
would
take
the
advantage
,
and
carry
it
away
from
them
both
;
"
which
my
master
would
needs
contend
to
have
some
kind
of
resemblance
with
our
suit
at
law
;
wherein
I
think
it
for
our
credit
not
to
undeceive
him
;
since
the
decision
he
mention
be
much
more
equitable
than
many
decree
among
us
;
because
the
plaintiff
and
defendant
there
lose
nothing
beside
the
stone
they
contend
for
:
 
whereas
our
court
of
equity
would
never
have
dismiss
the
cause
,
while
either
of
them
have
any
thing
leave
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
,
continue
his
discourse
,
say
,
"
there
be
nothing
that
render
the
Yahoos
more
odious
,
than
their
undistinguishing
appetite
to
devour
every
thing
that
come
in
their
way
,
whether
herb
,
root
,
berry
,
the
corrupt
flesh
of
animal
,
or
all
mingle
together
:
 
and
it
be
peculiar
in
their
temper
,
that
they
be
fonder
of
what
they
could
get
by
rapine
or
stealth
,
at
a
great
distance
,
than
much
well
food
provide
for
them
at
home
.
<EOS>
if
their
prey
hold
out
,
they
would
eat
till
they
be
ready
to
burst
;
after
which
,
nature
have
point
out
to
them
a
certain
root
that
give
them
a
general
evacuation
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
also
another
kind
of
root
,
very
juicy
,
but
somewhat
rare
and
difficult
to
be
find
,
which
the
Yahoos
seek
for
with
much
eagerness
,
and
would
suck
it
with
great
delight
;
it
produce
in
them
the
same
effect
that
wine
have
upon
us
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
make
them
sometimes
hug
,
and
sometimes
tear
one
another
;
they
would
howl
,
and
grin
,
and
chatter
,
and
reel
,
and
tumble
,
and
then
fall
asleep
in
the
mud
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
indeed
observe
that
the
Yahoos
be
the
only
animal
in
this
country
subject
to
any
disease
;
which
,
however
,
be
much
few
than
horse
have
among
us
,
and
contract
,
not
by
any
ill
-
treatment
they
meet
with
,
but
by
the
nastiness
and
greediness
of
that
sordid
brute
.
 
<EOS>
neither
have
their
language
any
more
than
a
general
appellation
for
those
malady
,
which
be
borrow
from
the
name
of
the
beast
,
and
call
hnea
-
yahoo
,
or
Yahoo
's
evil
;
and
the
cure
prescribed
be
a
mixture
of
their
own
dung
and
urine
,
forcibly
put
down
the
Yahoo
's
throat
.
 
<EOS>
this
I
have
since
often
know
to
have
be
take
with
success
,
and
do
here
freely
recommend
it
to
my
countryman
for
the
public
good
,
as
an
admirable
specific
against
all
disease
produce
by
repletion
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
to
learning
,
government
,
art
,
manufacture
,
and
the
like
,
"
my
master
confess
,
"
he
could
find
little
or
no
resemblance
between
the
Yahoos
of
that
country
and
those
in
ours
;
for
he
only
mean
to
observe
what
parity
there
be
in
our
nature
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
hear
,
indeed
,
some
curious
Houyhnhnms
observe
,
that
in
most
herd
there
be
a
sort
of
rule
Yahoo
<EOS>
(
as
among
us
there
be
generally
some
leading
or
principal
stag
in
a
park
)
,
<EOS>
who
be
always
more
deformed
in
body
,
and
mischievous
in
disposition
,
than
any
of
the
rest
;
that
this
leader
have
usually
a
favourite
as
like
himself
as
he
could
get
,
whose
employment
be
to
lick
his
master
's
foot
and
posterior
,
and
drive
the
female
Yahoos
to
his
kennel
;
for
which
he
be
now
and
then
reward
with
a
piece
of
ass
's
flesh
.
 
<EOS>
this
favourite
be
hate
by
the
whole
herd
,
and
therefore
,
to
protect
himself
,
keep
always
near
the
person
of
his
leader
.
 
<EOS>
He
usually
continue
in
office
till
a
bad
can
be
find
;
but
the
very
moment
he
be
discard
,
his
successor
,
at
the
head
of
all
the
Yahoos
in
that
district
,
young
and
old
,
male
and
female
,
come
in
a
body
,
and
discharge
their
excrement
upon
him
from
head
to
foot
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
far
this
may
be
applicable
to
our
court
,
and
favourite
,
and
minister
of
state
,
my
master
say
I
could
best
determine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
durst
make
no
return
to
this
malicious
insinuation
,
which
debase
human
understanding
below
the
sagacity
of
a
common
hound
,
who
have
judgment
enough
to
distinguish
and
follow
the
cry
of
the
able
dog
in
the
pack
,
without
be
ever
mistake
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
tell
me
,
"
there
be
some
quality
remarkable
in
the
Yahoos
,
which
he
have
not
observe
me
to
mention
,
or
at
least
very
slightly
,
in
the
account
I
have
give
of
humankind
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
those
animal
,
like
other
brute
,
have
their
female
in
common
;
but
in
this
they
differ
,
that
the
she
Yahoo
would
admit
the
male
while
she
be
pregnant
;
and
that
the
he
s
would
quarrel
and
fight
with
the
female
,
as
fiercely
as
with
each
other
;
both
which
practice
be
such
degree
of
infamous
brutality
,
as
no
other
sensitive
creature
ever
arrive
at
.
  
<EOS>
"
another
thing
he
wonder
at
in
the
Yahoos
,
be
their
strange
disposition
to
nastiness
and
dirt
;
whereas
there
appear
to
be
a
natural
love
of
cleanliness
in
all
other
animal
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
two
former
accusation
,
I
be
glad
to
let
them
pass
without
any
reply
,
because
I
have
not
a
word
to
offer
upon
them
in
defence
of
my
specie
,
which
otherwise
I
certainly
have
do
from
my
own
inclination
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
could
have
easily
vindicate
humankind
from
the
imputation
of
singularity
upon
the
last
article
,
if
there
have
be
any
swine
in
that
country
(
as
unluckily
for
me
there
be
not
)
,
which
,
although
it
may
be
a
sweeter
quadrupe
than
a
Yahoo
,
can
not
,
I
humbly
conceive
,
in
justice
,
pretend
to
more
cleanliness
;
and
so
his
honour
himself
must
have
own
,
if
he
have
see
their
filthy
way
of
feeding
,
and
their
custom
of
wallowing
and
sleep
in
the
mud
.
  
<EOS>
My
master
likewise
mention
another
quality
which
his
servant
have
discover
in
several
Yahoos
,
and
to
him
be
wholly
unaccountable
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
a
fancy
would
sometimes
take
a
Yahoo
to
retire
into
a
corner
,
to
lie
down
,
and
howl
,
and
groan
,
and
spurn
away
all
that
come
near
him
,
although
he
be
young
and
fat
,
want
neither
food
nor
water
,
nor
do
the
servant
imagine
what
could
possibly
ail
him
.
<EOS>
and
the
only
remedy
they
find
be
,
to
set
him
to
hard
work
,
after
which
he
would
infallibly
come
to
himself
.
"
 
<EOS>
to
this
I
be
silent
out
of
partiality
to
my
own
kind
;
yet
here
I
could
plainly
discover
the
true
seed
of
spleen
,
which
only
seize
on
the
lazy
,
the
luxurious
,
and
the
rich
;
who
,
if
they
be
force
to
undergo
the
same
regiman
,
I
would
undertake
for
the
cure
.
  
<EOS>
His
honour
have
further
observe
,
"
that
a
female
Yahoo
would
often
stand
behind
a
bank
or
a
bush
,
to
gaze
on
the
young
male
pass
by
,
and
then
appear
,
and
hide
,
use
many
antic
gesture
and
grimace
,
at
which
time
it
be
observe
that
she
have
a
most
offensive
smell
;
and
when
any
of
the
male
advanced
,
would
slowly
retire
,
look
often
back
,
and
with
a
counterfeit
show
of
fear
,
run
off
into
some
convenient
place
,
where
she
know
the
male
would
follow
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
other
time
,
if
a
female
stranger
come
among
them
,
three
or
four
of
her
own
sex
would
get
about
her
,
and
stare
,
and
chatter
,
and
grin
,
and
smell
her
all
over
;
and
then
turn
off
with
gesture
,
that
seem
to
express
contempt
and
disdain
.
"
  
<EOS>
perhaps
my
master
may
refine
a
little
in
these
speculation
,
which
he
have
draw
from
what
he
observe
himself
,
or
have
be
tell
him
by
other
;
however
,
I
could
not
reflect
without
some
amazement
,
and
much
sorrow
,
that
the
rudiment
of
lewdness
,
coquetry
,
censure
,
and
scandal
,
should
have
place
by
instinct
in
womankind
.
  
<EOS>
I
expect
every
moment
that
my
master
would
accuse
the
Yahoos
of
those
unnatural
appetite
in
both
sex
,
so
common
among
us
.
 
<EOS>
but
nature
,
it
seem
,
have
not
be
so
expert
a
school
-
mistress
;
and
these
politer
pleasure
be
entirely
the
production
of
art
and
reason
on
our
side
of
the
globe
.
   
<EOS>
the
author
relate
several
particular
of
the
Yahoos
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
virtue
of
the
Houyhnhnms
.
 
<EOS>
the
education
and
exercise
of
their
youth
.
 
<EOS>
Their
general
assembly
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
ought
to
have
understand
human
nature
much
well
than
I
suppose
it
possible
for
my
master
to
do
,
so
it
be
easy
to
apply
the
character
he
give
of
the
Yahoos
to
myself
and
my
countryman
;
and
I
believe
I
could
yet
make
further
discovery
,
from
my
own
observation
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
often
beg
his
honour
to
let
me
go
among
the
herd
of
Yahoos
in
the
neighbourhood
;
to
which
he
always
very
graciously
consent
,
be
perfectly
convince
that
the
hatred
I
bear
these
brute
would
never
suffer
me
to
be
corrupt
by
them
;
and
his
honour
order
one
of
his
servant
,
a
strong
sorrel
nag
,
very
honest
and
good
-
natured
,
to
be
my
guard
;
without
whose
protection
I
durst
not
undertake
such
adventure
.
 
<EOS>
for
I
have
already
tell
the
reader
how
much
I
be
pester
by
these
odious
animal
,
upon
my
first
arrival
;
and
I
afterwards
fail
very
narrowly
,
three
or
four
time
,
of
fall
into
their
clutch
,
when
I
happen
to
stray
at
any
distance
without
my
hanger
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
reason
to
believe
they
have
some
imagination
that
I
be
of
their
own
specie
,
which
I
often
assist
myself
by
strip
up
my
sleeve
,
and
show
my
naked
arm
and
breast
in
their
sight
,
when
my
protector
be
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
at
which
time
they
would
approach
as
near
as
they
durst
,
and
imitate
my
action
after
the
manner
of
monkey
,
but
ever
with
great
sign
of
hatred
;
as
a
tame
jackdaw
with
cap
and
stocking
be
always
persecute
by
the
wild
one
,
when
he
happen
to
be
get
among
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
prodigiously
nimble
from
their
infancy
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
once
catch
a
young
male
of
three
year
old
,
and
endeavour
,
by
all
mark
of
tenderness
,
to
make
it
quiet
;
but
the
little
imp
fall
a
squalling
,
and
scratching
,
and
bite
with
such
violence
,
that
I
be
force
to
let
it
go
;
and
it
be
high
time
,
for
a
whole
troop
of
old
one
come
about
us
at
the
noise
,
but
find
the
cub
be
safe
(
for
away
it
run
)
,
and
my
sorrel
nag
be
by
,
they
durst
not
venture
near
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
observe
the
young
animal
's
flesh
to
smell
very
rank
,
and
the
stink
be
somewhat
between
a
weasel
and
a
fox
,
but
much
more
disagreeable
.
 
<EOS>
I
forget
another
circumstance
<EOS>
(
and
perhaps
I
may
have
the
reader
's
pardon
if
it
be
wholly
omit
)
,
that
while
I
hold
the
odious
vermin
in
my
hand
,
it
void
its
filthy
excrement
of
a
yellow
liquid
substance
all
over
my
clothe
;
but
by
good
fortune
there
be
a
small
brook
hard
by
,
where
I
wash
myself
as
clean
as
I
could
;
although
I
durst
not
come
into
my
master
's
presence
until
I
be
sufficiently
air
.
  
<EOS>
by
what
I
could
discover
,
the
Yahoos
appear
to
be
the
most
unteachable
of
all
animal
:
 
their
capacity
never
reach
high
than
to
draw
or
carry
burden
.
 
<EOS>
yet
I
be
of
opinion
,
this
defect
arise
chiefly
from
a
perverse
,
restive
disposition
;
for
they
be
cunne
,
malicious
,
treacherous
,
and
revengeful
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
strong
and
hardy
,
but
of
a
cowardly
spirit
,
and
,
by
consequence
,
insolent
,
abject
,
and
cruel
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
observe
,
that
the
red
haired
of
both
sex
be
more
libidinous
and
mischievous
than
the
rest
,
whom
yet
they
much
exceed
in
strength
and
activity
.
  
<EOS>
the
Houyhnhnms
keep
the
Yahoos
for
present
use
in
hut
not
far
from
the
house
;
but
the
rest
be
send
abroad
to
certain
field
,
where
they
dig
up
root
,
eat
several
kind
of
herb
,
and
search
about
for
carrion
,
or
sometimes
catch
weasel
and
luhimuhs
(
a
sort
of
wild
rat
)
,
which
they
greedily
devour
.
 
<EOS>
Nature
have
teach
them
to
dig
deep
hole
with
their
nail
on
the
side
of
a
rise
ground
,
wherein
they
lie
by
themselves
;
only
the
kennel
of
the
female
be
large
,
sufficient
to
hold
two
or
three
cub
.
  
<EOS>
They
swim
from
their
infancy
like
frog
,
and
be
able
to
continue
long
under
water
,
where
they
often
take
fish
,
which
the
female
carry
home
to
their
young
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
upon
this
occasion
,
I
hope
the
reader
will
pardon
my
relate
an
odd
adventure
.
  
<EOS>
be
one
day
abroad
with
my
protector
the
sorrel
nag
,
and
the
weather
exceed
hot
,
I
entreat
him
to
let
me
bathe
in
a
river
that
be
near
.
 
<EOS>
He
consent
,
and
I
immediately
strip
myself
stark
naked
,
and
go
down
softly
into
the
stream
.
 
<EOS>
It
happen
that
a
young
female
Yahoo
,
stand
behind
a
bank
,
see
the
whole
proceeding
,
and
inflame
by
desire
,
as
the
nag
and
I
conjecture
,
come
run
with
all
speed
,
and
leap
into
the
water
,
within
five
yard
of
the
place
where
I
bathe
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
never
in
my
life
so
terribly
frightened
.
 
<EOS>
the
nag
be
graze
at
some
distance
,
not
suspect
any
harm
.
 
<EOS>
She
embrace
me
after
a
most
fulsome
manner
.
<EOS>
I
roar
as
loud
as
I
could
,
and
the
nag
come
gallop
towards
me
,
whereupon
she
quit
her
grasp
,
with
the
utmost
reluctancy
,
and
leap
upon
the
opposite
bank
,
where
she
stand
gaze
and
howl
all
the
time
I
be
put
on
my
clothe
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
matter
of
diversion
to
my
master
and
his
family
,
as
well
as
of
mortification
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
for
now
I
could
no
longer
deny
that
I
be
a
real
Yahoo
in
every
limb
and
feature
,
since
the
female
have
a
natural
propensity
to
me
,
as
one
of
their
own
specie
.
 
<EOS>
neither
be
the
hair
of
this
brute
of
a
red
colour
(
which
may
have
be
some
excuse
for
an
appetite
a
little
irregular
)
,
but
black
as
a
sloe
,
and
her
countenance
do
not
make
an
appearance
altogether
so
hideous
as
the
rest
of
her
kind
;
for
I
think
she
could
not
be
above
eleven
year
old
.
  
<EOS>
have
live
three
year
in
this
country
,
the
reader
,
I
suppose
,
will
expect
that
I
should
,
like
other
traveller
,
give
him
some
account
of
the
manner
and
custom
of
its
inhabitant
,
which
it
be
indeed
my
principal
study
to
learn
.
  
<EOS>
as
these
noble
Houyhnhnms
be
endow
by
nature
with
a
general
disposition
to
all
virtue
,
and
have
no
conception
or
idea
of
what
be
evil
in
a
rational
creature
,
so
their
grand
maxim
be
,
to
cultivate
reason
,
and
to
be
wholly
govern
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
neither
be
reason
among
them
a
point
problematical
,
as
with
us
,
where
man
can
argue
with
plausibility
on
both
side
of
the
question
,
but
strike
you
with
immediate
conviction
;
as
it
must
needs
do
,
where
it
be
not
mingle
,
obscure
,
or
discolour
,
by
passion
and
interest
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
it
be
with
extreme
difficulty
that
I
could
bring
my
master
to
understand
the
meaning
of
the
word
opinion
,
or
how
a
point
could
be
disputable
;
because
reason
teach
us
to
affirm
or
deny
only
where
we
be
certain
;
and
beyond
our
knowledge
we
can
not
do
either
.
 
<EOS>
so
that
controversy
,
wrangling
,
dispute
,
and
positiveness
,
in
false
or
dubious
proposition
,
be
evil
unknown
among
the
Houyhnhnms
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
like
manner
,
when
I
use
to
explain
to
him
our
several
system
of
natural
philosophy
,
he
would
laugh
,
"
that
a
creature
pretend
to
reason
,
should
value
itself
upon
the
knowledge
of
other
people
's
conjecture
,
and
in
thing
where
that
knowledge
,
if
it
be
certain
,
could
be
of
no
use
.
"
 
<EOS>
wherein
he
agree
entirely
with
the
sentiment
of
Socrates
,
as
Plato
deliver
them
;
which
I
mention
as
the
high
honour
I
can
do
that
prince
of
philosopher
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
since
reflect
,
what
destruction
such
doctrine
would
make
in
the
library
of
Europe
;
and
how
many
path
of
fame
would
be
then
shut
up
in
the
learned
world
.
  
<EOS>
friendship
and
benevolence
be
the
two
principal
virtue
among
the
Houyhnhnms
;
and
these
not
confine
to
particular
object
,
but
universal
to
the
whole
race
;
for
a
stranger
from
the
remote
part
be
equally
treat
with
the
near
neighbour
,
and
wherever
he
go
,
look
upon
himself
as
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
They
preserve
decency
and
civility
in
the
high
degree
,
but
be
altogether
ignorant
of
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
no
fondness
for
their
colt
or
foal
,
but
the
care
they
take
in
educate
them
proceed
entirely
from
the
dictate
of
reason
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
observe
my
master
to
show
the
same
affection
to
his
neighbour
's
issue
,
that
he
have
for
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
They
will
have
it
that
nature
teach
them
to
love
the
whole
species
,
and
it
be
reason
<EOS>
only
that
make
a
distinction
of
person
,
where
there
be
a
superior
degree
of
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
matron
Houyhnhnms
have
produce
one
of
each
sex
,
they
no
longer
accompany
with
their
consort
,
except
they
lose
one
of
their
issue
by
some
casualty
,
which
very
seldom
happen
;
but
in
such
a
case
they
meet
again
;
or
when
the
like
accident
befall
a
person
whose
wife
be
past
bearing
,
some
other
couple
bestow
on
him
one
of
their
own
colt
,
and
then
go
together
again
until
the
mother
be
pregnant
.
 
<EOS>
this
caution
be
necessary
,
to
prevent
the
country
from
be
overburden
with
number
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
race
of
inferior
Houyhnhnms
,
breed
up
to
be
servant
,
be
not
so
strictly
limit
upon
this
article
:
 
<EOS>
these
be
allow
to
produce
three
of
each
sex
,
to
be
domestic
in
the
noble
family
.
  
<EOS>
in
their
marriage
,
they
be
exactly
careful
to
choose
such
colour
as
will
not
make
any
disagreeable
mixture
in
the
breed
.
 
<EOS>
Strength
be
chiefly
value
in
the
male
,
and
comeliness
in
the
female
;
not
upon
the
account
of
love
,
but
to
preserve
the
race
from
degenerate
;
for
where
a
female
happen
to
excel
in
strength
,
a
consort
be
choose
,
with
regard
to
comeliness
.
  
<EOS>
courtship
,
love
,
present
,
jointure
<EOS>
,
settlement
have
no
place
in
their
thought
,
or
term
whereby
to
express
them
in
their
language
.
<EOS>
the
young
couple
meet
,
and
be
join
,
merely
because
it
be
the
determination
of
their
parent
and
friend
;
it
be
what
they
see
do
every
day
,
and
they
look
upon
it
as
one
of
the
necessary
action
of
a
reasonable
being
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
violation
of
marriage
,
or
any
other
unchastity
,
be
never
hear
of
;
and
the
married
pair
pass
their
life
with
the
same
friendship
and
mutual
benevolence
,
that
they
bear
to
all
other
of
the
same
specie
who
come
in
their
way
,
without
jealousy
,
fondness
,
quarrelling
,
or
discontent
.
  
<EOS>
in
educate
the
youth
of
both
sex
,
their
method
be
admirable
,
and
highly
deserve
our
imitation
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
not
suffer
to
taste
a
grain
of
oats
,
except
upon
certain
day
,
till
eighteen
year
old
;
nor
milk
,
but
very
rarely
;
and
in
summer
they
graze
two
hour
in
the
morning
,
and
as
many
in
the
evening
,
which
their
parent
likewise
observe
;
but
the
servant
be
not
allow
above
half
that
time
,
and
a
great
part
of
their
grass
be
bring
home
,
which
they
eat
at
the
most
convenient
hour
,
when
they
can
be
best
spare
from
work
.
  
<EOS>
temperance
,
industry
,
exercise
,
and
cleanliness
,
be
the
lesson
equally
enjoin
to
the
young
one
of
both
sex
:
 
and
my
master
think
it
monstrous
in
us
,
to
give
the
female
a
different
kind
of
education
from
the
male
,
except
in
some
article
of
domestic
management
;
whereby
,
as
he
truly
observe
,
one
half
of
our
native
be
good
for
nothing
but
bring
child
into
the
world
;
and
to
trust
the
care
of
our
child
to
such
useless
animal
,
he
say
,
be
yet
a
great
instance
of
brutality
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
Houyhnhnms
train
up
their
youth
to
strength
,
speed

and
hardiness
,
by
exercise
them
in
run
race
up
and
down
steep
hill
,
and
over
hard
stony
ground
;
and
when
they
be
all
in
a
sweat

they
be

to
leap
over
head

into
a
pond

<EOS>
four

the

on

the
field

laden
with
hay

and
oats

for
a
repast

after
which

be

about
twenty
mile
from

here

,
if

take
notice
of
a
general
tradition
,
"
that
Yahoos
have
not
be
always
in
their
country
;
but
that
many
age
ago
,
two
of
these
brute
appear
together
upon
a
mountain
;
whether
produce
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
upon
corrupt
mud
and
slime
,
or
from
the
ooze
and
froth
of
the
sea
,
be
never
know
;
that
these
Yahoos
engender
,
and
their
brood
,
in
a
short
time
,
grow
so
numerous
as
to
overrun
and
infest
the
whole
nation
;
that
the
Houyhnhnms
,
to
get
rid
of
this
evil
,
make
a
general
hunting
,
and
at
last
enclose
the
whole
herd
;
and
destroy
the
elder
,
every
Houyhnhnm
keep
two
young
one
in
a
kennel
,
and
bring
them
to
such
a
degree
of
tameness
,
as
an
animal
,
so
savage
by
nature
,
can
be
capable
of
acquire
,
use
them
for
draught
and
carriage
;
that
there
seem
to
be
much
truth
in
this
tradition
,
and
that
those
creature
could
not
be
yinhniamshy
(
or
aborigine
of
the
land
)
,
because
of
the
violent
hatred
the
Houyhnhnms
,
as
well
as
all
other
animal
,
bore
them
,
which
,
although
their
evil
disposition
sufficiently
deserve
,
could
never
have
arrive
at
so
high
a
degree
if
they
have
be
aborigine
,
or
else
they
would
have
long
since
be
root
out
;
that
the
inhabitant
,
take
a
fancy
to
use
the
service
of
the
Yahoos
,
have
,
very
imprudently
,
neglect
to
cultivate
the
breed
of
ass
,
which
be
a
comely
animal
,
easily
keep
,
more
tame
and
orderly
,
without
any
offensive
smell
,
strong
enough
for
labour
,
although
they
yield
to
the
other
in
agility
of
body
,
and
if
their
braying
be
no
agreeable
sound
,
it
be
far
preferable
to
the
horrible
howling
of
the
Yahoos
.
"
  
<EOS>
several
other
declare
their
sentiment
to
the
same
purpose
,
when
my
master
propose
an
expedient
to
the
assembly
,
whereof
he
have
indeed
borrow
the
hint
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
approve
of
the
tradition
mention
by
the
honourable
member
who
speak
before
,
and
affirm
,
that
the
two
Yahoos
say
to
be
see
first
among
them
,
have
be
drive
thither
over
the
sea
;
that
come
to
land
,
and
be
forsake
by
their
companion
,
they
retire
to
the
mountain
,
and
degenerate
by
degree
,
become
in
process
of
time
much
more
savage
than
those
of
their
own
specie
in
the
country
<EOS>
whence
these
two
original
come
.
 
<EOS>
the
reason
of
this
assertion
be
,
that
he
have
now
in
his
possession
a
certain
wonderful
Yahoo
(
mean
myself
)
which
most
of
them
have
hear
of
,
and
many
of
them
have
see
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
relate
to
them
how
he
first
find
me
;
that
my
body
be
all
cover
with
an
artificial
composure
of
the
skin
and
hair
of
other
animal
;
that
I
speak
in
a
language
of
my
own
,
and
have
thoroughly
learn
theirs
;
that
I
have
relate
to
him
the
accident
which
bring
me
thither
;
that
when
he
see
me
without
my
covering
,
I
be
an
exact
Yahoo
in
every
part
,
only
of
a
whiter
colour
,
less
hairy
,
and
with
short
claw
.
 
<EOS>
He
add
,
how
I
have
endeavour
to
persuade
him
,
that
in
my
own
and
other
country
,
the
Yahoos
act
as
the
governing
,
rational
animal
,
and
hold
the
Houyhnhnms
in
servitude
;
that
he
observe
in
me
all
the
quality
of
a
Yahoo
,
only
a
little
more
civilized
by
some
tincture
of
reason
,
which
,
however
,
be
in
a
degree
as
far
inferior
to
the
Houyhnhnm
race
,
as
the
Yahoos
of
their
country
be
to
me
;
that
,
among
other
thing
,
I
mention
a
custom
we
have
of
castrate
Houyhnhnms
when
they
be
young
,
in
order
to
render
them
tame
;
that
the
operation
be
easy
and
safe
;
that
it
be
no
shame
to
learn
wisdom
from
brute
,
as
industry
be
teach
by
the
ant
,
and
building
by
the
swallow
(
for
so
I
translate
the
word
lyhannh
,
although
it
be
a
much
large
fowl
)
;
that
this
invention
may
be
practise
upon
the
young
Yahoos
here
,
which
besides
render
them
tractable
and
fitter
for
use
,
would
in
an
age
put
an
end
to
the
whole
specie
,
without
destroy
life
;
that
in
the
mean
time
the
Houyhnhnms
should
be
exhort
to
cultivate
the
breed
of
ass
,
which
,
as
they
be
in
all
respect
more
valuable
brute
,
so
they
have
this
advantage
,
to
be
fit
for
service
at
five
year
old
,
which
the
other
be
not
till
twelve
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
all
my
master
think
fit
to
tell
me
,
at
that
time
,
of
what
pass
in
the
grand
council
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
pleased
to
conceal
one
particular
,
which
relate
personally
to
myself
<EOS>
,
whereof
I
soon
feel
the
unhappy
effect
,
as
the
reader
will
know
in
its
proper
place
,
and
whence
<EOS>
I
date
all
the
succeed
misfortune
of
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
the
Houyhnhnms
have
no
letter
,
and
consequently
their
knowledge
be
all
traditional
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
happen
few
event
of
any
moment
among
a
people
so
well
united
,
<EOS>
naturally
dispose
to
every
virtue
,
wholly
govern
by
reason
,
and
cut
off
from
all
commerce
with
other
nation
,
the
historical
part
be
easily
preserve
without
burden
their
memory
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
already
observe
that
they
be
subject
to
no
disease
,
and
therefore
can
have
no
need
of
physician
.
<EOS>
however
,
they
have
excellent
medicine
,
compose
of
herb
,
to
cure
accidental
bruise
and
cut
in
the
pastern
or
frog
of
the
foot
,
by
sharp
stone
,
as
well
as
other
maim
and
hurt
in
the
several
part
of
the
body
.
  
<EOS>
They
calculate
the
year
by
the
revolution
of
the
sun
and
moon
,
but
use
no
subdivision
into
week
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
well
enough
acquaint
with
the
motion
of
those
two
luminary
,
and
understand
the
nature
of
eclipse
;
and
this
be
the
utmost
progress
of
their
astronomy
.
  
<EOS>
in
poetry
,
they
must
be
allow
to
excel
all
other
mortal
;
wherein
the
justness
of
their
simile
,
and
the
minuteness
as
well
as
exactness
of
their
description
,
be
indeed
inimitable
.
 
<EOS>
Their
verse
abound
very
much
in
both
of
these
,
and
usually
contain
either
some
exalt
notion
of
friendship
and
benevolence
or
the
praise
of
those
who
be
victor
in
race
and
other
bodily
exercise
.
 
<EOS>
Their
building
,
although
very
rude
and
simple
,
be
not
inconvenient
,
but
well
contrive
to
defend
them
from
all
injury
of
and
heat
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
a
kind
of
tree
,
which
at
forty
year
old
loosen
in
the
root
,
and
fall
with
the
first
storm
:
 
it
grow
very
straight
,
and
be
point
like
stake
with
a
sharp
stone
(
for
the
Houyhnhnms
<EOS>
know
not
the
use
of
iron
)
,
they
stick
them
erect
in
the
ground
,
about
ten
inch
asunder
,
and
then
weave
in
oat
straw
,
or
sometimes
wattle
,
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
roof
be
make
after
the
same
manner
,
and
so
be
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
the
Houyhnhnms
use
the
hollow
part
,
between
the
pastern
and
the
hoof
of
their
fore
-
foot
,
as
we
do
our
hand
,
and
this
with
great
dexterity
than
I
could
at
first
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
a
white
mare
of
our
family
thread
a
needle
(
which
I
lend
her
on
purpose
)
with
that
joint
.
 
<EOS>
They
milk
their
cow
,
reap
their
oat
,
and
do
all
the
work
which
require
hand
,
in
the
same
manner
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
a
kind
of
hard
flint
,
which
,
by
grind
against
other
stone
,
they
form
into
instrument
,
that
serve
instead
of
wedge
,
axis
,
and
hammer
.
<EOS>
with
tool
make
of
these
flint
,
they
likewise
cut
their
hay
,
and
reap
their
oat
,
which
there
grow
naturally
in
several
field
;
the
Yahoos
draw
home
the
sheaf
in
carriage
,
and
the
servant
tread
them
in
certain
covered
hut
to
get
out
the
grain
,
which
be
keep
in
store
.
 
<EOS>
They
make
a
rude
kind
of
earthen
and
wooden
vessel
,
and
bake
the
former
in
the
sun
.
  
<EOS>
if
they
can
avoid
casualty
,
they
die
only
of
old
age
,
and
be
bury
in
the
obscure
place
that
can
be
find
,
their
friend
and
relation
express
neither
joy
nor
grief
at
their
departure
;
nor
do
the
die
person
discover
the
least
regret
that
he
be
leave
the
world
,
any
more
than
if
he
be
upon
return
home
from
a
visit
to
one
of
his
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
my
master
have
once
make
an
appointment
with
a
friend
and
his
family
to
come
to
his
house
,
upon
some
affair
of
importance
:
 
on
the
day
fix
,
the
mistress
and
her
two
child
come
very
late
;
she
make
two
excuse
,
first
for
her
husband
,
who
,
as
she
say
,
happen
that
very
morning
to
shnuwnh
.
 
<EOS>
the
word
be
strongly
expressive
in
their
language
,
but
not
easily
render
into
English
;
it
signify
,
"
to
retire
to
his
first
mother
.
"
 
<EOS>
Her
excuse
for
not
come
sooner
,
be
,
that
her
husband
die
late
in
the
morning
,
she
be
a
good
while
consult
her
servant
about
a
convenient
place
where
his
body
should
be
lay
;
and
I
observe
,
she
behave
herself
at
our
house
as
cheerfully
as
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
She
die
about
three
month
after
.
  
<EOS>
They
live
generally
to
seventy
,
or
seventy
-
five
year
,
very
seldom
to
fourscore
.
 
<EOS>
some
week
before
their
death
,
they
feel
a
gradual
decay
;
but
without
pain
.
 
<EOS>
during
this
time
they
be
much
visit
by
their
friend
,
because
they
can
not
go
abroad
with
their
usual
ease
and
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
about
ten
day
before
their
death
,
which
they
seldom
fail
in
computing
,
they
return
the
visit
that
have
be
make
them
by
those
who
be
near
in
the
neighbourhood
,
be
carry
in
a
convenient
sledge
draw
by
Yahoos
;
which
vehicle
they
use
,
not
only
upon
this
occasion
,
but
when
they
grow
old
,
upon
long
journey
,
or
when
they
be
lame
by
any
accident
:
 
and
therefore
when
the
die
Houyhnhnms
return
those
visit
,
they
take
a
solemn
leave
of
their
friend
,
as
if
they
be
go
to
some
remote
part
of
the
country
,
where
they
design
to
pass
the
rest
of
their
life
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
it
may
be
worth
observe
,
that
the
Houyhnhnms
have
no
word
in
their
language
to
express
any
thing
that
be
evil
,
except
what
they
borrow
from
the
deformity
or
ill
quality
of
the
Yahoos
.
 
<EOS>
thus
they
denote
the
folly
of
a
servant
,
an
omission
of
a
child
,
a
stone
that
cut
their
foot
,
a
continuance
of
foul
or
unseasonable
weather
,
and
the
like
,
by
add
to
each
the
epithet
of
Yahoo

I

with
great
pleasure

further

I
have
the
favour
of
be
admit
to
several
Houyhnhnms
,
who
come
to
visit
or
dine
with
my
master
;
where
his
honour
graciously
suffer
me
to
wait
in
the
room
,
and
listen
to
their
discourse
.
<EOS>
both
he
and
his
company
would
often
descend
to
ask
me
question
,
and
receive
my
answer
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
also
sometimes
the
honour
of
attend
my
master
in
his
visit
to
other
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
presume
to
speak
,
except
in
answer
to
a
question
;
and
then
I
do
it
with
inward
regret
,
because
it
be
a
loss
of
so
much
time
for
improve
myself
;
but
I
be
infinitely
delighted
with
the
station
of
an
humble
auditor
in
such
conversation
,
where
nothing
pass
but
what
be
useful
,
express
in
the
few
and
most
significant
word
;
where
,
as
I
have
already
say
,
the
great
decency
be
observe
,
without
the
least
degree
of
ceremony
;
where
no
person
speak
without
be
please
himself
,
and
please
his
companion
;
where
there
be
no
interruption
,
tediousness
,
heat
,
or
difference
of
sentiment
.
<EOS>
They
have
a
notion
,
that
when
people
be
meet
together
,
a
short
silence
do
much
improve
conversation
:
 
this
I
find
to
be
true
;
for
during
those
little
intermission
of
talk
,
new
idea
would
arise
in
their
mind
,
which
very
much
enliven
the
discourse
.
<EOS>
Their
subject
be
,
generally
on
friendship
and
benevolence
,
on
order
and
economy
;
sometimes
upon
the
visible
operation
of
nature
,
or
ancient
tradition
;
upon
the
bound
and
limit
of
virtue
;
upon
the
unerring
rule
of
reason
,
or
upon
some
determination
to
be
take
at
the
next
great
assembly
:
 
and
often
upon
the
various
excellence
of
poetry
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
add
,
without
vanity
,
that
my
presence
often
give
them
sufficient
matter
for
discourse
,
because
it
afford
my
master
an
occasion
of
let
his
friend
into
the
history
of
me
and
my
country
,
upon
which
they
be
all
pleased
to
descant
,
in
a
manner
not
very
advantageous
to
humankind
:
 
and
for
that
reason
I
shall
not
repeat
what
they
say
;
only
I
may
be
allow
to
observe
,
that
his
honour
,
to
my
great
admiration
,
appear
to
understand
the
nature
of
Yahoos
much
well
than
myself
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
through
all
our
vice
and
folly
,
and
discover
many
,
which
I
have
never
mention
to
him
,
by
only
suppose
what
quality
a
Yahoo
of
their
country
,
with
a
small
proportion
of
reason
,
may
be
capable
of
exert
;
and
conclude
,
with
too
much
probability
,
"
<EOS>
how
vile
,
as
well
as
miserable
,
such
a
creature
must
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
freely
confes
,
that
all
the
little
knowledge
I
have
of
any
value
,
be
acquire
by
the
lecture
I
receive
from
my
master
,
and
from
hear
the
discourse
of
him
and
his
friend
;
to
which
I
should
be
prouder
to
listen
,
than
to
dictate
to
the
great
and
wise
assembly
in
Europe
.
 
<EOS>
I
admire
the
strength
,
comeliness
,
and
speed
of
the
inhabitant
;
and
such
a
constellation
of
virtue
,
in
such
amiable
person
,
produce
in
me
the
high
veneration
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
,
indeed
,
I
do
not
feel
that
natural
awe
,
which
the
Yahoos
and
all
other
animal
bear
toward
them
;
but
it
grow
upon
me
by
decree
,
much
sooner
than
I
imagine
,
and
be
mingle
with
a
respectful
love
and
gratitude
,
that
they
would
condescend
to
distinguish
me
from
the
rest
of
my
specie
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
think
of
my
family
,
my
friend
,
my
countryman
,
or
the
human
race
in
general
,
I
consider
them
,
as
they
really
be
,
Yahoos
in
shape
and
disposition
,
perhaps
a
little
more
civilized
,
and
qualify
with
the
gift
of
speech
;
but
make
no
other
use
of
reason
,
than
to
improve
and
multiply
those
vice
whereof
their
brother
in
this
country
have
only
the
share
that
nature
allot
them
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
happen
to
behold
the
reflection
of
my
own
form
in
a
lake
or
fountain
,
I
turn
away
my
face
in
horror
and
detestation
of
myself
,
and
could
better
endure
the
sight
of
a
common
Yahoo
than
of
my
own
person
.
 
<EOS>
by
converse
with
the
Houyhnhnms
,
and
look
upon
them
with
delight
,
I
fall
to
imitate
their
gait
and
gesture
,
which
be
now
grow
into
a
habit
;
and
my
friend
often
tell
me
,
in
a
blunt
way
,
"
that
I
trot
like
a
horse
;
"
which
,
however
,
I
take
for
a
great
compliment
.
 
<EOS>
neither
<EOS>
shall
I
disown
,
that
in
speak
I
be
apt
to
fall
into
the
voice
and
manner
of
the
Houyhnhnms
,
and
hear
myself
ridicule
on
that
account
,
without
the
least
mortification
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
all
this
happiness
,
and
when
I
look
upon
myself
to
be
fully
settle
for
life
,
my
master
send
for
me
one
morning
a
little
earlier
than
his
usual
hour
.
 
<EOS>
I
observe
by
his
countenance
that
he
be
in
some
perplexity
,
and
at
a
loss
how
to
begin
what
he
have
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
short
silence
,
he
tell
me
,
"
he
do
not
know
how
I
would
take
what
he
be
go
to
say
:
 
that
in
the
last
general
assembly
,
when
the
affair
of
the
Yahoos
be
enter
upon
,
the
representative
have
take
offence
at
his
keep
a
Yahoo
(
mean
myself
)
in
his
family
,
more
like
a
Houyhnhnm
than
a
brute
animal
;
that
he
be
know
frequently
to
converse
with
me
,
as
if
he
could
receive
some
advantage
or
pleasure
in
my
company
;
that
such
a
practice
be
not
agreeable
to
reason
or
nature
,
or
a
thing
ever
hear
of
before
among
them
;
the
assembly
do
therefore
exhort
him
either
to
employ
me
like
the
rest
of
my
specie
,
or
command
me
to
swim
back
to
the
place
<EOS>
whence
<EOS>
I
come
:
 
that
the
first
of
these
expedient
be
utterly
reject
by
all
the
Houyhnhnms
who
have
ever
see
me
at
his
house
or
their
own
;
for
they
allege
,
<EOS>
that
because
I
have
some
rudiment
of
reason
,
add
to
the
natural
pravity
of
those
animal
,
it
be
to
be
fear
I
may
be
able
to
seduce
them
into
the
woody
and
mountainous
part
of
the
country
,
and
bring
them
in
troop
by
night
to
destroy
the
Houyhnhnms
'
cattle
,
as
be
naturally
of
the
ravenous
kind
,
and
averse
from
labour
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
master
add
,
"
that
he
be
daily
press
by
the
Houyhnhnms
of
the
neighbourhood
to
have
the
assembly
's
exhortation
execute
,
which
he
could
not
put
off
much
longer
.
 
<EOS>
He
doubt
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
swim
to
another
country
;
and
therefore
wish
I
would
contrive
some
sort
of
vehicle
,
resemble
those
I
have
describe
to
him
,
that
may
carry
me
on
the
sea
;
in
which
work
<EOS>
I
should
have
the
assistance
of
his
own
servant
,
as
well
as
those
of
his
neighbour
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
conclude
,
"
that
for
his
own
part
,
he
could
have
be
content
to
keep
me
in
his
service
as
long
as
I
live
;
because
he
find
I
have
cure
myself
of
some
bad
habit
and
disposition
,
by
endeavour
,
as
far
as
my
inferior
nature
be
capable
,
to
imitate
the
Houyhnhnms
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
should
here
observe
to
the
reader
,
that
a
decree
of
the
general
assembly
in
this
country
be
express
by
the
word
hnhloayn
,
which
signify
an
exhortation
,
as
near
as
I
can
render
it
;
for
they
have
no
conception
how
a
rational
creature
can
be
compel
,
but
only
advise
,
or
exhort
;
because
no
person
can
disobey
reason
,
without
give
up
his
claim
to
be
a
rational
creature
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
strike
with
the
utmost
grief
and
despair
at
my
master
's
discourse
;
and
be
unable
to
support
the
agony
I
be
under
,
I
fall
into
a
swoon
at
his
foot
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
myself
,
he
tell
me
"
that
he
conclude
I
have
be
dead
;
"
for
these
people
be
subject
to
no
such
imbecility
of
nature
.
 
<EOS>
I
answer
in
a
faint
voice
,
"
that
death
would
have
be
too
great
a
happiness
;
that
although
I
could
not
blame
the
assembly
's
exhortation
,
or
the
urgency
of
his
friend
;
yet
,
in
my
weak
and
corrupt
judgment
,
I
think
it
may
consist
with
reason
to
have
be
less
rigorous
;
that
I
could
not
swim
a
league
,
and
probably
the
near
land
to
theirs
may
be
distant
above
a
hundred
:
 
<EOS>
that
many
material
,
necessary
for
make
a
small
vessel
to
carry
me
off
,
be
wholly
want
in
this
country
;
which
,
however
,
I
would
attempt
,
in
obedience
and
gratitude
to
his
honour
,
although
I
conclude
the
thing
to
be
impossible
,
and
therefore
look
on
myself
as
already
devoted
to
destruction
<EOS>
;
that
the
certain
prospect
of
an
unnatural
death
be
the
least
of
my
evil
;
for
,
suppose
I
should
escape
with
life
by
some
strange
adventure
,
how
could
I
think
with
temper
of
pass
my
day
among
Yahoos
,
and
relapse
into
my
old
corruption
,
for
want
of
example
to
lead
and
keep
me
within
the
path
of
virtue
?
<EOS>
that
I
know
too
well
upon
what
solid
reason
all
the
determination
of
the
wise
Houyhnhnms
be
found
,
not
to
be
shake
by
argument
of
mine
,
a
miserable
Yahoo
;
and
therefore
,
after
present
him
with
my
humble
thank
for
the
offer
of
his
servant
'
assistance
in
make
a
vessel
,
and
desire
a
reasonable
time
for
so
difficult
a
work
,
I
tell
him
I
would
endeavour
to
preserve
a
wretched
being
;
and
if
ever
I
return
to
England
,
be
not
without
hope
of
be
useful
to
my
own
specie
,
by
celebrate
the
praise
of
the
renowned
Houyhnhnms
,
and
propose
their
virtue
to
the
imitation
of
mankind
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
master
,
in
a
few
word
,
make
me
a
very
gracious
reply
;
allow
me
the
space
of
two
month
to
finish
my
boat
;
and
order
the
sorrel
nag
,
my
fellow
-
servant
(
for
so
,
at
this
distance
,
I
may
presume
to
call
him
)
,
to
follow
my
instruction
;
because
I
tell
my
master
,
"
that
his
help
would
be
sufficient
,
and
I
know
he
have
a
tenderness
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
his
company
,
my
first
business
be
to
go
to
that
part
of
the
coast
where
my
rebellious
crew
have
order
me
to
be
set
on
shore
.
<EOS>
I
get
upon
a
height
,
and
look
on
every
side
into
the
sea
;
fancy
I
see
a
small
island
toward
the
north
-
east
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
out
my
pocket
glass
,
and
could
then
clearly
distinguish
it
above
five
league
off
,
as
I
compute
;
but
it
appear
to
the
sorrel
nag
to
be
only
a
blue
cloud
:
 
for
as
he
have
no
conception
of
any
country
beside
his
own
,
so
he
could
not
be
as
expert
in
distinguish
remote
object
at
sea
,
as
we
who
so
much
converse
in
that
element
.
  
<EOS>
after
I
have
discover
this
island
,
I
consider
no
further
;
but
resolve
it
should
if
possible
,
be
the
first
place
of
my
banishment
,
leave
the
consequence
to
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
I
return
home
,
and
consult
with
the
sorrel
nag
,
we
go
into
a
copse
at
some
distance
,
where
I
with
my
knife
,
and
he
with
a
sharp
flint
,
fasten
very
artificially
after
their
manner
,
to
a
wooden
handle
,
cut
down
several
oak
wattle
,
about
the
thickness
of
a
walking
-
staff
,
and
some
large
piece
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
shall
not
trouble
the
reader
with
a
particular
description
of
my
own
mechanic
;
let
it
suffice
to
say
,
that
in
six
week
time
with
the
help
of
the
sorrel
nag
,
who
perform
the
part
that
require
most
labour
,
I
finish
a
sort
of
indian
canoe
,
but
much
large
,
cover
it
with
the
skin
of
Yahoos
,
well
stitch
together
with
hempen
thread
of
my
own
making
.
 
<EOS>
My
sail
be
likewise
compose
of
the
skin
of
the
same
animal
;
but
I
make
use
of
the
young
I
could
get
,
the
old
be
too
tough
and
thick
;
and
I
likewise
provide
myself
with
four
paddle
.
 
<EOS>
I
lay
in
a
stock
of
boil
flesh
,
of
rabbit
and
fowl
,
and
take
with
me
two
vessel
,
one
fill
with
milk
and
the
other
with
water
.
  
<EOS>
I
try
my
canoe
in
a
large
pond
,
near
my
master
's
house
,
and
then
correct
in
it
what
be
amiss
;
stop
all
the
chink
with
Yahoos
'
tallow
,
till
I
find
it
staunch
,
and
able
to
bear
me
and
my
freight
;
and
,
when
it
be
as
complete
as
I
could
possibly
make
it
,
I
have
it
draw
on
a
carriage
very
gently
by
Yahoos
to
the
sea
-
side
,
under
the
conduct
of
the
sorrel
nag
and
another
servant
.
  
<EOS>
when
all
be
ready
,
and
the
day
come
for
my
departure
,
I
take
leave
of
my
master
and
lady
and
the
whole
family
,
my
eye
flow
with
tear
,
and
my
heart
quite
sink
with
grief
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
honour
,
out
of
curiosity
,
and
,
perhaps
,
(
if
I
may
speak
without
vanity
,
)
partly
out
of
kindness
,
be
determined
to
see
me
in
my
canoe
,
and
get
several
of
his
neighbouring
friend
to
accompany
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
force
to
wait
above
an
hour
for
the
tide
;
and
then
observe
the
wind
very
fortunately
bear
toward
the
island
to
which
I
intend
to
steer
my
course
,
I
take
a
second
leave
of
my
master
:
 
<EOS>
but
as
I
be
go
to
prostrate
myself
to
kiss
his
hoof
,
he
do
me
the
honour
to
raise
it
gently
to
my
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
ignorant
how
much
I
have
be
censure
for
mention
this

I

but
,
if

be
better
acquaint
with
the

they
would
soon

<EOS>
I
pay
my

to

of

<EOS>
I
begin
this
desperate
voyage
on
February
15
,
1714
-
15
,
at
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
the
wind
be
very
favourable
;
however
,
I
make
use
at
first
only
of
my
paddle
;
but
consider
I
should
soon
be
weary
,
and
that
the
wind
may
chop
about
,
I
venture
to
set
up
my
little
sail
;
and
thus
,
with
the
help
of
the
tide
,
I
go
at
the
rate
of
a
league
and
a
half
an
hour
,
as
near
as
I
could
guess
.
 
<EOS>
My
master
and
his
friend
continue
on
the
shore
till
I
be
almost
out
of
sight
;
and
I
often
hear
the
sorrel
nag
(
who
always
love
me
)
cry
out
,
"
Hnuy
illa
nyha
,
majah
Yahoo
;
"
 
"
take
care
of
thyself
,
gentle
Yahoo
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
design
be
,
if
possible
,
to
discover
some
small
island
uninhabite
,
yet
sufficient
,
by
my
labour
,
to
furnish
me
with
the
necessary
of
life
,
which
I
would
have
think
a
great
happiness
,
than
to
be
first
minister
in
the
politest
court
of
Europe
;
so
horrible
be
the
idea
I
conceive
of
return
to
live
in
the
society
,
and
under
the
government
of
Yahoos
.
 
<EOS>
for
in
such
a
solitude
as
I
desire
,
I
could
at
least
enjoy
my
own
thought
,
and
reflect
with
delight
on
the
virtue
of
those
inimitable
Houyhnhnms
,
without
an
opportunity
of
degenerate
into
the
vice
and
corruption
of
my
own
specie
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
may
remember
what
I
relate
,
when
my
crew
conspire
against
me
,
and
confine
me
to
my
cabin
;
how
I
continue
there
several
week
without
know
what
course
we
take
;
and
when
I
be
put
ashore
in
the
long
-
boat
,
how
the
sailor
tell
me
,
with
oath
,
whether
true
or
false
,
"
that
they
know
not
in
what
part
of
the
world
we
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
do
then
believe
us
to
be
about
10
degree
southward
of
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
,
or
about
45
degree
southern
latitude
,
as
I
gather
from
some
general
word
I
overhear
among
them
,
be
I
suppose
to
the
south
-
east
in
their
intend
voyage
to
Madagascar
.
 
<EOS>
and
although
this
be
little
well
than
conjecture
,
yet
I
resolve
to
steer
my
course
eastward
,
hope
to
reach
the
south
-
west
coast
of
New
Holland
,
and
perhaps
some
such
island
as
I
desire
lying
westward
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
wind
be
full
west
,
and
by
six
in
the
evening
I
compute
I
have
go
eastward
at
least
eighteen
league
;
when
I
spy
a
very
small
island
about
half
a
league
off
,
which
I
soon
reach
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
nothing
but
a
rock
,
with
one
creek
naturally
arch
by
the
force
of
tempest
.
<EOS>
here
I
put
in
my
canoe
,
and
climb
a
part
of
the
rock
,
I
could
plainly
discover
land
to
the
east
,
extend
from
south
to
north
.
<EOS>
I
lie
all
night
in
my
canoe
;
and
repeat
my
voyage
early
in
the
morning
,
I
arrive
in
seven
hour
to
the
south
-
east
point
of
New
Holland
.
 
<EOS>
this
confirm
me
in
the
opinion
I
have
long
entertain
,
that
the
map
and
chart
place
this
country
<EOS>
at
least
three
degree
more
to
the
east
than
it
really
be
;
which
think
I
communicate
many
year
ago
to
my
worthy
friend
,
Mr.
Herman
Moll
,
and
give
him
my
reason
for
it
,
although
he
have
rather
choose
to
follow
other
author
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
no
inhabitant
in
the
place
where
I
land
,
and
be
unarmed
,
I
be
afraid
of
venture
far
into
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
some
shellfish
on
the
shore
,
and
eat
them
raw
,
not
daring
to
kindle
a
fire
,
for
fear
of
be
discover
by
the
native
.
 
<EOS>
I
continue
three
day
feed
on
oyster
and
limpet
,
to
save
my
own
provision
;
and
I
fortunately
find
a
brook
of
excellent
water
,
which
give
me
great
relief
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
fourth
day
,
venture
out
early
a
little
too
far
,
I
see
twenty
or
thirty
native
upon
a
height
not
above
five
hundred
yard
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
stark
naked
,
man
,
woman
,
and
child
,
round
a
fire
,
as
I
could
discover
by
the
smoke
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
them
spy
me
,
and
give
notice
to
the
rest
;
five
of
them
advance
toward
me
,
leave
the
woman
and
child
at
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
what
haste
I
could
to
the
shore
,
and
,
get
into
my
canoe
,
shove
off
:
 
<EOS>
the
savage
,
observe
me
retreat
,
run
after
me
:
 
and
before
I
could
get
far
enough
into
the
sea
,
discharge
an
arrow
which
wound
me
deeply
on
the
inside
of
my
left
knee
:
 
<EOS>
I
shall
carry
the
mark
to
my
grave
.
 
<EOS>
I
apprehend
the
arrow
may
be
poison
,
and
paddle
out
of
the
reach
of
their
dart
(
be
a
calm
day
)
,
I
make
a
shift
to
suck
the
wound
,
and
dress
it
as
well
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
at
a
loss
what
to
do
,
<EOS>
for
I
durst
not
return
to
the
same
landing
-
place
,
but
stand
to
the
north
,
and
be
force
to
paddle
,
for
the
wind
,
though
very
gentle
,
be
against
me
,
blow
north
-
west
.
<EOS>
as
I
be
look
about
for
a
secure
landing
-
place
,
I
see
a
sail
to
the
north
-
north
-
east
,
which
appear
every
minute
more
visible
,
I
be
in
some
doubt
whether
I
should
wait
for
them
or
not
;
but
at
last
my
detestation
of
the
Yahoo
race
prevail
:
 
and
turn
my
canoe
,
I
sail
and
paddle
together
to
the
south
,
and
get
into
the
same
creek
whence
I
set
out
in
the
morning
,
choose
rather
to
trust
myself
among
these
barbarian
,
than
live
with
European
Yahoos
.
 
<EOS>
I
draw
up
my
canoe
as
close
as
I
could
to
the
shore
,
and
hide
myself
behind
a
stone
by
the
little
brook
,
which
,
as
I
have
already
say
,
be
excellent
water
.
  
<EOS>
the
ship
come
within
half
a
league
of
this
creek
,
and
send
her
long
boat
with
vessel
to
take
in
fresh
water
(
for
the
place
,
it
seem
,
be
very
well
know
)
;
but
I
do
not
observe
it
,
till
the
boat
be
almost
on
shore
;
and
it
be
too
late
to
seek
another
hiding
-
place
.
<EOS>
the
seaman
at
their
landing
observe
my
canoe
,
and
rummage
it
all
over
,
easily
conjecture
that
the
owner
could
not
be
far
off
.
 
<EOS>
four
of
them
,
well
armed
,
search
every
cranny
and
lurking
-
hole
,
till
at
last
they
find
me
flat
on
my
face
behind
the
stone
.
 
<EOS>
They
gaze
awhile
in
admiration
at
my
strange
uncouth
dress
;
my
coat
make
of
skin
,
my
wooden
-
sole
shoe
,
and
my
fur
stocking
;
whence
,
however
,
they
conclude
,
I
be
not
a
native
of
the
place
,
who
all
go
naked
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
the
seaman
,
in
Portuguese
,
bid
me
rise
,
and
ask
who
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
understand
that
language
very
well
,
and
get
upon
my
foot
,
say
,
"
I
be
a
poor
Yahoo
banish
from
the
Houyhnhnms
,
and
desire
they
would
please
to
let
me
depart
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
admire
to
hear
me
answer
them
in
their
own
tongue
,
and
see
by
my
complexion
<EOS>
I
must
be
a
European
;
but
be
at
a
loss
to
know
what
I
mean
by
Yahoos
and
Houyhnhnms
;
and
at
the
same
time
fall
a
-
laughing
at
my
strange
tone
in
speaking
,
which
resemble
the
neighing
of
a
horse
.
<EOS>
I
tremble
all
the
while
betwixt
fear
and
hatred
.
 
<EOS>
I
again
desire
leave
to
depart
,
and
be
gently
move
to
my
canoe
;
but
they
lay
hold
of
me
,
desire
to
know
,
"
what
country
I
be
of
?
<EOS>
whence
I
come
?
"
<EOS>
with
many
other
question
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
them
"
I
be
bear
in
England
,
whence
<EOS>
I
come
about
five
year
ago
,
and
then
their
country
and
our
be
at
peace
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
hope
they
would
not
treat
me
as
an
enemy
,
since
I
mean
them
no
harm
,
but
be
a
poor
Yahoo
seek
some
desolate
place
where
to
pass
the
remainder
of
his
unfortunate
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
they
begin
to
talk
,
I
think
I
never
hear
or
see
any
thing
more
unnatural
;
for
it
appear
to
me
as
monstrous
as
if
a
dog
or
a
cow
should
speak
in
England
,
or
a
Yahoo
in
Houyhnhnmland
.
 
<EOS>
the
honest
Portuguese
be
equally
amazed
at
my
strange
dress
,
and
the
odd
manner
of
deliver
my
word
,
which
,
however
,
they
understand
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
They
speak
to
me
with
great
humanity
,
and
say
,
"
they
be
sure
the
captain
would
carry
me
gratis
to
Lisbon
,
<EOS>
whence
I
may
return
to
my
own
country
;
that
two
of
the
seaman
would
go
back
to
the
ship
,
inform
the
captain
of
what
they
have
see
,
and
receive
his
order
;
in
the
mean
time
,
unless
I
would
give
my
solemn
oath
not
to
fly
,
they
would
secure
me
by
force
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
best
to
comply
with
their
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
very
curious
to
know
my
story
,
but
I
give
them
very
little
satisfaction
,
and
they
all
conjecture
that
my
misfortune
have
impair
my
reason
.
 
<EOS>
in
two
hour
the
boat
,
which
go
laden
with
vessel
of
water
,
return
,
with
the
captain
's
command
to
fetch
me
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
I
fall
on
my
knee
to
preserve
my
liberty
;
but
all
be
in
vain
;
and
the
man
,
have
tie
me
with
cord
,
heave
me
into
the
boat
,
<EOS>
whence
<EOS>
I
be
take
into
the
ship
,
and
thence
into
the
captain
's
cabin
.
  
<EOS>
His
name
be
Pedro
de
Mendez
;
he
be
a
very
courteous
and
generous
person
.
 
<EOS>
He
entreat
me
to
give
some
account
of
myself
,
and
desire
to
know
what
I
would
eat
or
drink
;
say
,
"
I
should
be
use
as
well
as
himself
;
"
and
speak
so
many
obliging
thing
,
that
I
wonder
to
find
such
civility
from
a
Yahoo
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
remain
silent
and
sullen
;
I
be
ready
to
faint
at
the
very
smell
of
him
and
his
man
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
desire
something
to
eat
out
of
my
own
canoe
;
but
he
order
me
a
chicken
,
and
some
excellent
wine
,
and
then
direct
that
I
should
be
put
to
bed
in
a
very
clean
cabin
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
undress
myself
,
but
lie
on
the
bed
-
clothe
,
and
in
half
an
hour
steal
out
,
when
I
think
the
crew
be
at
dinner
,
and
get
to
the
side
of
the
ship
,
be
go
to
leap
into
the
sea
,
and
swim
for
my
life
,
rather
than
continue
among
Yahoos
.
 
<EOS>
but
one
of
the
seaman
prevent
me
,
and
have
inform
the
captain
,
I
be
chain
to
my
cabin
.
  
<EOS>
after
dinner
,
Don
Pedro
come
to
me
,
and
desire
to
know
my
reason
for
so
desperate
an
attempt
;
assure
me
,
"
he
only
mean
to
do
me
all
the
service
he
be
able
;
"
and
speak
so
very
movingly
,
that
at
last
I
descend
to
treat
him
like
an
animal
which
have
some
little
portion
of
reason
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
him
a
very
short
relation
of
my
voyage
;
of
the
conspiracy
against
me
by
my
own
man
;
of
the
country
where
they
set
me
on
shore
,
and
of
my
five
year
residence
there
.
 
<EOS>
all
which
he
look
upon
as
if
it
be
a
dream
or
a
vision
<EOS>
;
whereat
I
take
great
offence
;
for
I
have
quite
forget
the
faculty
of
lying
,
so
peculiar
to
Yahoos
,
in
all
country
where
they
preside
,
and
,
consequently
,
<EOS>
their
disposition
of
suspect
truth
in
other
of
their
own
specie
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
him
,
"
whether
it
be
the
custom
in
his
country
to
say
the
thing
which
be
not
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
assure
him
,
"
I
have
almost
forget
what
he
mean
by
falsehood
,
and
if
I
have
live
a
thousand
year
in
Houyhnhnmland
,
I
should
never
have
hear
a
lie
from
the
mean
servant
;
that
I
be
altogether
indifferent
whether
he
believe
me
or
not
;
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
in
return
for
his
favour
,
I
would
give
so
much
allowance
to
the
corruption
of
his
nature
,
as
to
answer
any
objection
he
would
please
to
make
,
and
then
he
may
easily
discover
the
truth
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
captain
,
a
wise
man
,
after
many
endeavour
to
catch
me
tripping
in
some
part
of
my
story
,
at
last
begin
to
have
a
well
opinion
of
my
veracity
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
add
,
"
that
since
I
profess
so
inviolable
an
attachment
to
truth
,
I
must
give
him
my
word
and
honour
to
bear
him
company
in
this
voyage
,
without
attempt
any
thing
against
my
life
;
or
else
he
would
continue
me
a
prisoner
till
we
arrive
at
Lisbon
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
give
him
the
promise
he
require
;
but
at
the
same
time
protest
,
"
that
I
would
suffer
the

rather
than
return
to

among
Yahoos

"
  
<EOS>
Our
voyage
pass
without
any
considerable
accident
.
 
<EOS>
in
gratitude
to
the
captain
,
I
sometimes
sit
with
him
,
at
his
earnest
request
,
and
strove
to
conceal
my
antipathy
against
human
kind
,
although
it
often
break
out
;
which
he
suffer
to
pass
without
observation
.
<EOS>
but
the
great
part
of
the
day
I
confine
myself
to
my
cabin
,
to
avoid
see
any
of
the
crew
.
 
<EOS>
the
captain
have
often
entreat
me
to
strip
myself
of
my
savage
dress
,
and
offer
to
lend
me
the
good
suit
of
clothe
he
have
.
 
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
I
would
not
be
prevail
on
to
accept
,
abhor
to
cover
myself
with
any
thing
that
have
be
on
the
back
of
a
Yahoo
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
desire
he
would
lend
me
two
clean
shirt
,
which
,
have
be
wash
since
he
wear
them
,
I
believe
would
not
so
much
defile
me
.
 
<EOS>
these
<EOS>
I
change
every
second
day
,
and
wash
them
myself
.
  
<EOS>
We
arrive
at
Lisbon
,
November
5
,
1715
.
 
<EOS>
at
our
landing
,
the
captain
force
me
to
cover
myself
with
his
cloak
,
to
prevent
the
rabble
from
crowd
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
convey
to
his
own
house
;
and
at
my
earnest
request
he
lead
me
up
to
the
high
room
backwards
.
 
<EOS>
I
conjure
him
"
to
conceal
from
all
person
what
I
have
tell
him
of
the
Houyhnhnms
;
because
the
least
hint
of
such
a
story
would
not
only
draw
number
of
people
to
see
me
,
but
probably
put
me
in
danger
of
be
imprison
,
or
burn
by
the
Inquisition
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
captain
persuade
me
to
accept
a
suit
of
clothe
newly
make
;
but
I
would
not
suffer
the
tailor
to
take
my
measure
;
however
,
Don
Pedro
be
almost
of
my
size
,
they
fit
me
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
He
accoutre
me
with
other
necessary
,
all
new
,
which
I
air
for
twenty
-
four
hour
before
I
would
use
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
captain
have
no
wife
,
nor
above
three
servant
,
none
of
which
be
suffer
to
attend
at
meal
;
and
his
whole
deportment
be
so
obliging
,
add
to
very
good
human
understanding
,
that
I
really
begin
to
tolerate
his
company
.
 
<EOS>
He
gain
so
far
upon
me
,
that
I
venture
to
look
out
of
the
back
window
.
 
<EOS>
by
degree
<EOS>
I
be
bring
into
another
room
<EOS>
,
whence
I
peep
into
the
street
,
but
draw
my
head
back
in
a
fright
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
week
's
time
he
seduce
me
down
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
my
terror
gradually
lessen
,
but
my
hatred
and
contempt
seem
to
increase
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
at
last
bold
enough
to
walk
the
street
in
his
company
,
but
keep
my
nose
well
stop
with
rue
,
or
sometimes
with
tobacco
.
  
<EOS>
in
ten
day
,
Don
Pedro
,
to
whom
I
have
give
some
account
of
my
domestic
affair
,
put
it
upon
me
,
as
a
matter
of
honour
and
conscience
,
"
that
I
ought
to
return
to
my
native
country
,
and
live
at
home
with
my
wife
and
child
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
"
there
be
an
english
ship
in
the
port
just
ready
to
sail
,
and
he
would
furnish
me
with
all
thing
necessary
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
tedious
to
repeat
his
argument
,
and
my
contradiction
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
it
be
altogether
impossible
to
find
such
a
solitary
island
as
I
desire
to
live
in
;
but
I
may
command
in
my
own
house
,
and
pass
my
time
in
a
manner
as
recluse
as
I
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
comply
at
last
,
find
I
could
not
do
better
.
 
<EOS>
I
leave
Lisbon
the
24th
day
of
November
,
in
an
english
merchantman
,
but
who
be
the
master
I
never
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
Don
Pedro
accompany
me
to
the
ship
,
and
lend
me
twenty
pound
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
kind
leave
of
me
,
and
embrace
me
at
parting
,
which
I
bear
as
well
as
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
during
this
last
voyage
I
have
no
commerce
with
the
master
or
any
of
his
man
;
but
,
pretend
I
be
sick
,
keep
close
in
my
cabin
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
fifth
of
December
,
1715
,
we
cast
anchor
in
the
Downs
,
about
nine
in
the
morning
,
and
at
three
in
the
afternoon
I
get
safe
to
my
house
at
Rotherhith
.
<EOS>
{

}
  
My
wife
and
family
receive
me
with
great
surprise
and
joy
,
because
they
conclude
me
certainly
dead
;
but
I
must
freely
confess
the
sight
of
them
fill
me
only
with
hatred
,
disgust
,
and
contempt
;
and
the
more
,
by
reflect
on
the
near
alliance
I
have
to
them
.
<EOS>
for
although
,
since
my
unfortunate
exile
from
the
Houyhnhnm
country
,
I
have
compel
myself
to
tolerate
the
sight
of
Yahoos
,
and
to
converse
with
Don
Pedro
de
Mendez
,
yet
my
memory
and
imagination
be
perpetually
fill
with
the
virtue
and
idea
of
those
exalt
Houyhnhnms
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
begin
to
consider
that
,
by
copulate
with
one
of
the
Yahoo
specie
I
have
become
a
parent
of
more
,
it
strike
me
with
the
utmost
shame
,
confusion
,
and
horror
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
enter
the
house
,
my
wife
take
me
in
her
arm
,
and
kiss
me
;
at
which
,
have
not
be
use
to
the
touch
of
that
odious
animal
for
so
many
year
,
I
fall
into
a
swoon
for
almost
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
time
I
be
write
,
it
be
five
year
since
my
last
return
to
England
.
 
<EOS>
during
the
first
year
,
I
could
not
endure
my
wife
or
child
in
my
presence
;
the
very
smell
of
them
be
intolerable
;
much
less
could
I
suffer
them
to
eat
in
the
same
room
.
<EOS>
to
this
hour
they
dare
not
presume
to
touch
my
bread
,
or
drink
out
of
the
same
cup
,
neither
be
I
ever
able
to
let
one
of
them
take
me
by
the
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
money
I
lay
out
be
to
buy
two
young
stone
-
horse
,
which
I
keep
in
a
good
stable
;
and
next
to
them
,
the
groom
be
my
greatest
favourite
,
for
I
feel
my
spirit
revive
by
the
smell
he
contract
in
the
stable
.
 
<EOS>
My
horse
understand
me
tolerably
well
;
I
converse
with
them
at
least
four
hour
every
day
.
<EOS>
They
be
stranger
to
bridle
or
saddle
;
they
live
in
great
amity
with
me
and
friendship
to
each
other

<EOS>
thus
,
gentle
reader
,
I
have
give
thee
a
faithful
history
of
my
travel
for
sixteen
year
and
above
seven
month
:
 
<EOS>
wherein
I
have
not
be
so
studious
of
ornament
as
of
truth
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
,
perhaps
,
like
other
,
have
astonish
thee
with
strange
improbable
tale
;
but
I
rather
choose
to
relate
plain
matter
of
fact
,
in
the
simple
manner
and
style
;
because
my
principal
design
be
to
inform
,
and
not
to
amuse
thee
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
easy
for
us
who
travel
into
remote
country
,
which
be
seldom
visit
by
Englishmen
or
other
Europeans
,
to
form
description
of
wonderful
animal
both
at
sea
and
land
.
 
<EOS>
whereas
a
traveller
's
chief
aim
should
be
to
make
man
wise
and
well
,
and
to
improve
their
mind
by
the
bad
,
as
well
as
good
,
example
of
what
they
deliver
concern
foreign
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
heartily
wish
a
law
be
enact
,
that
every
traveller
,
before
he
be
permit
to
publish
his
voyage
,
should
be
oblige
to
make
oath
before
the
Lord
High
Chancellor
,
that
all
he
intend
to
print
be
absolutely
true
to
the
good
of
his
knowledge
;
for
then
the
world
would
no
longer
be
deceive
,
as
it
usually
be
,
while
some
writer
,
to
make
their
work
pass
the
well
upon
the
public
,
impose
the
gross
falsity
on
the
unwary
reader
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
peruse
several
book
of
travel
with
great
delight
in
my
young
day
;
but
have
since
go
over
most
part
of
the
globe
,
and
be
able
to
contradict
many
fabulous
account
from
my
own
observation
,
it
have
give
me
a
great
disgust
against
this
part
of
reading
,
and
some
indignation
to
see
the
credulity
of
mankind
so
impudently
abuse
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
since
my
acquaintance
be
pleased
to
think
my
poor
endeavour
may
not
be
unacceptable
to
my
country
,
I
impose
on
myself
,
as
a
maxim
never
to
be
swerve
from
,
that
I
would
strictly
adhere
to
truth
;
neither
indeed
can
I
be
ever
under
the
least
temptation
to
vary
from
it
,
while
I
retain
in
my
mind
the
lecture
and
example
of
my
noble
master
and
the
other
illustrious
Houyhnhnms
of
whom
I
have
so
long
the
honour
to
be
an
humble
hearer
.
     
<EOS>
Nec
si
miserum
Fortuna
Sinonem
Finxit
,

mendacemque

.
  
<EOS>
I
know
very
well
,
how
little
reputation
be
to
be
get
by
writing
which
require
neither
genius
nor
learning
,
nor
indeed
any
other
talent
,
except
a
good
memory
,
or
an
exact
journal
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
likewise
,
that
writer
of
travel
,
like
dictionary
-
maker
,
be
sink
into
oblivion
by
the
weight
and
bulk
of
those
who
come
last
,
and
therefore
lie
uppermost
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
highly
probable
,
that
such
traveller
,
who
shall
hereafter
visit
the
country
describe
in
this
work
of
mine
,
may
,
by
detect
my
error
(
if
there
be
any
)
,
and
add
many
new
discovery
of
their
own
,
justle
me
out
of
vogue
,
and
stand
in
my
place
,
make
the
world
forget
that
ever
I
be
an
author
.
 
<EOS>
this
indeed
would
be
too
great
a
mortification
,
if
I
write
for
fame
:
 
<EOS>
but
as
my
sole
intention
be
the
public
good
,
I
can
not
be
altogether
disappoint
.
 
<EOS>
for
who
can
read
of
the
virtue
I
have
mention
in
the
glorious
Houyhnhnms
,
without
be
ashamed
of
his
own
vice
,
when
he
consider
himself
as
the
reasoning
,
govern
animal
of
his
country
?
 
<EOS>
I
shall
say
nothing
of
those
remote
nation
where
Yahoos
preside
;
among
which
the
least
corrupted
be
the
Brobdingnagians
;
whose
wise
maxim
in
morality
and
government
it
would
be
our
happiness
to
observe
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
forbear
descant
further
,
and
rather
leave
the
judicious
reader
to
his
own
remark
and
application
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
a
little
pleased
that
this
work
of
mine
can
possibly
meet
with
no
censurer
:
 
for
what
objection
can
be
make
against
a
writer
,
who
relate
only
plain
fact
,
that
happen
in
such
distant
country
,
where
we
have
not
the
least
interest
,
with
respect
either
to
trade
or
negotiation
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
carefully
avoid
every
fault
with
which
common
writer
of
travel
be
often
too
justly
charge
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
I
meddle
not
the
least
with
any
party
,
but
write
without
passion
,
prejudice
,
or
ill
-
will
against
any
man
,
or
number
of
man
,
whatsoever
.
 
<EOS>
I
write
for
the
noble
end
,
to
inform
and
instruct
mankind
;
over
whom
I
may
,
without
breach
of
modesty
,
pretend
to
some
superiority
,
from
the
advantage
I
receive
by
converse
so
long
among
the
most
accomplished
Houyhnhnms
.
 
<EOS>
I
write
without
any
view
to
profit
or
praise
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
suffer
a
word
to
pass
that
may
look
like
reflection
,
or
possibly
give
the
least
offence
,
even
to
those
who
be
most
ready
to
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
so
that
I
hope
I
may
with
justice
pronounce
myself
an
author
perfectly
blameless
;
against
whom
the
tribe
of
Answerers
,
Considerers
,
Observers
,
Reflectors
,
detector
,
Remarkers
,
will
never
be
able
to
find
matter
for
exercise
their
talent
.
  
<EOS>
I
confess
,
it
be
whisper
to
me
,
"
that
I
be
bind
in
duty
,
as
a
subject
of
England
,
to
have
give
in
a
memorial
to
a
secretary
of
state
at
my
first
come
over
;
because
,
whatever
land
be
discover
by
a
subject
belong
to
the
crown
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
I
doubt
whether
our
conquest
in
the
country
I
treat
of
would
be
as
easy
as
those
of
Ferdinando
Cortez
over
the
naked
Americans
.
 
<EOS>
the
Lilliputians
,
I
think
,
be
hardly
worth
the
charge
of
a
fleet
and
army
to
reduce
them
;
and
I
question
whether
it
may
be
prudent
or
safe
to
attempt
the
Brobdingnagians
;
or
whether
an
english
army
would
be
much
at
their
ease
with
the
Flying
Island
over
their
head
.
 
<EOS>
the
Houyhnhnms
indeed
appear
not
to
be
so
well
prepared
for
war
,
a
science
to
which
they
be
perfect
stranger
,
and
especially
against
missive
weapon
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
suppose
myself
to
be
a
minister
of
state
,
I
could
never
give
my
advice
for
invade
them
.
 
<EOS>
Their
prudence
,
unanimity
,
unacquaintedness
with
fear
,
and
their
love
of
their
country
,
would
amply
supply
all
defect
in
the
military
art
.
<EOS>
imagine
twenty
thousand
of
them
break
into
the
midst
of
an
european
army
,
confound
the
rank
,
overturn
the
carriage
,
batter
the
warrior
'
face
into
mummy
by
terrible
yerk
from
their
hinder
hoof
;
for
they
would
well
deserve
the
character
give
to
Augustus
,
Recalcitrat
undique
tutus
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
instead
of
proposal
for
conquer
that
magnanimous
nation
,
I
rather
wish
they
be
in
a
capacity
,
or
disposition
,
to
send
a
sufficient
number
of
their
inhabitant
for
civilize
Europe
,
by
teach
us
the
first
principle
of
honour
,
justice
,
truth
,
temperance
,
public
spirit
,
fortitude
,
chastity
,
friendship
,
benevolence
,
and
fidelity

which
virtue
be
still
retain
among
us
in
most
language
,
and
be
to
be
meet
with
in
modern
,
as
well
as
ancient
author
;
which
I
be
able
to
assert
from
my
own
small
reading
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
have
another
reason
,
which
make
me
less
forward
to
enlarge
his
majesty
's
dominion
by
my
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
I
have
conceive
a
few
scruple
with
relation
to
the
distributive
justice
of
prince
upon
those
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
for
instance
,
a
crew
of
pirate
be
drive
by
a
storm
they
know
not
whither
;
at
length
a
boy
discover
land
from
the
topmast
;
they
go
on
shore
to
rob
and
plunder
,
they
see
a
harmless
people
,
be
entertain
with
kindness
;
they
give
the
country
a
new
name
;
they
take
formal
possession
of
it
for
their
king
;
they
set
up
a
rotten
plank
,
or
a
stone
,
for
a
memorial
;
they
murder
two
or
three
dozen
of
the
native
,
bring
away
a
couple
more
,
by
force
,
for
a
sample
;
return
home
,
and
get
their
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
here
commence
a
new
dominion
acquire
with
a
title
by
divine
right
.
 
<EOS>
ship
be
send
with
the
first
opportunity
;
the
native
drive
out
or
destroy
;
their
prince
torture
to
discover
their
gold
;
a
free
license
give
to
all
act
of
inhumanity
and
lust
,
the
earth
reek
with
the
blood
of
its
inhabitant
:
 
and
this
execrable
crew
of
butcher
,
employ
in
so
pious
an
expedition
,
be
a
modern
colony
,
send
to
convert
and
civilize
an
idolatrous
and
barbarous
people
!
  
<EOS>
but
this
description
,
I
confess
,
do
by
no
mean
affect
the
british
nation
,
who
may
be
an
example
to
the
whole
world
for
their
wisdom
,
care
,
and
justice
in
plant
colony
;
their
liberal
endowment
for
the
advancement
of
religion
and
learning
;
their
choice
of
devout
and
able
pastor
to
propagate
Christianity
;
their
caution
in
stock
their
province
with
people
of
sober
life
and
conversation
from
this
the
mother
kingdom
;
their
strict
regard
to
the
distribution
of
justice
,
in
supply
the
civil
administration
through
all
their
colony
with
officer
of
the
great
ability
,
utter
stranger
to
corruption
;
and
,
to
crown
all
,
by
send
the
most
vigilant
and
virtuous
governor
,
who
have
no
other
view
than
the
happiness
of
the
people
over
whom
they
preside
,
and
the
honour
of
the
king
their
master
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
those
country
which
I
have
describe
do
not
appear
to
have
any
desire
of
be
conquer
and
enslave
,
murder
or
drive
out
by
colony
,
nor
abound
either
in
gold
,
silver
,
sugar
,
or
tobacco
,
I
do
humbly
conceive
,
they
be
by
no
means
proper
object
of
our
zeal
,
our
valour
,
or
our
interest
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
if
those
whom
it
more
concern
think
fit
to
be
of
another
opinion
,
I
be
ready
to
depose
,
when
I
shall
be
lawfully
call
,
that
no
European
do
ever
visit
those
country
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
if
the
inhabitant
ought
to
be
believe
,
unless
a
dispute
may
arise
concern
the
two
Yahoos
,
say
to
have
be
see
many
year
ago
upon
a
mountain
in
Houyhnhnmland
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
as
to
the
formality
of
take
possession
in
my
sovereign
's
name
,
it
never
come
once
into
my
thought
;
and
<EOS>
if
it
have
,
yet
,
as
my
affair
then
stand
,
I
should
perhaps
,
in
point
of
prudence
and
self
-
preservation
,
have
put
it
off
to
a
well
opportunity
.
  
<EOS>
have
thus
answer
the
only
objection
that
can
ever
be
raise
against
me
as
a
traveller
,
I
here
take
a
final
leave
of
all
my
courteous
reader
,
and
return
to
enjoy
my
own
speculation
in
my
little
garden
at
Redriff
;
to
apply
those
excellent
lesson
of
virtue
which
I
learn
among
the
Houyhnhnms
;
to
instruct
the
Yahoos
of
my
own
family
,
be
far
as
I
shall
find
them
docible
animal
;
to
behold
my
figure
often
in
a
glass
,
and
thus
,
if
possible
,
habituate
myself
by
time
to
tolerate
the
sight
of
a
human
creature
;
to
lament
the
brutality
to
Houyhnhnms
in
my
own
country
,
but
always
treat
their
person
with
respect
,
for
the
sake
of
my
noble
master
,
his
family
,
his
friend
,
and
the
whole
Houyhnhnm
race
,
whom
these
of
our
have
the
honour
to
resemble
in
all
their
lineament
,
however
their
intellectual
come
to
degenerate
.
  
<EOS>
I
begin
last
week
to
permit
my
wife
to
sit
at
dinner
with
me
,
at
the
farth
end
of
a
long
table
;
and
to
answer
(
but
with
the
utmost
brevity
)
<EOS>
the
few
question
I
ask
her
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
the
smell
of
a
Yahoo
continue
very
offensive
,
I
always
keep
my
nose
well
stop
with
rue
,
lavender
,
or
tobacco
leave
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
although
it
be
hard
for
a
man
late
in
life
to
remove
old
habit
,
I
be
not
altogether
out
of
hope
,
in
some
time
,
to
suffer
a
neighbour
Yahoo
in
my
company
,
without
the
apprehension
I
be
yet
under
of
his
tooth
or
his
claws
.
  
<EOS>
My
reconcilement
to
the
Yahoo
kind
in
general
may
not
be
so
difficult
,
if
they
would
be
content
with
those
vice
and
folly
only
which
nature
have
entitle
them
to
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
in
the
least
provoke
at
the
sight
of
a
lawyer
,
a
pickpocket
,
a
colonel
,
a
fool
,
a
lord
,
a
gamester
,
a
politician
,
a
whoremonger
,
a
physician
,
an
evidence
,
a
suborner
,
an
attorney
,
a
traitor
,
or
the
like
;
this
be
all
accord
to
the
due
course
of
thing
:
 
but
when
I
behold
a
lump
of
deformity
and
disease
,
both
in
body
and
mind
,
smitten
with
pride
,
it
immediately
break
all
the
measure
of
my
patience
;
neither
shall
I
be
ever
able
to
comprehend
how
such
an
animal
,
and
such
a
vice
,
could
tally
together
.
 
<EOS>
the
wise
and
virtuous
Houyhnhnms
,
who
abound
in
all
excellence
that
can
adorn
a
rational
creature
,
have
no
name
for
this
vice
in
their
language
,
which
have
no
term
to
express
any
thing
that
be
evil
,
except
those
whereby
they
describe
the
detestable
quality
of
their
Yahoos
,
among
which
they
be
not
able
to
distinguish
this
of
pride
,
for
want
of
thoroughly
understand
human
nature
,
as
it
show
itself
in
other
country
where
that
animal
preside
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
,
who
have
more
experience
,
could
plainly
observe
some
rudiment
of
it
among
the
wild
Yahoos
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
Houyhnhnms
,
who
live
under
the
government
of
reason
,
be
no
more
proud
of
the
good
quality
they
possess
,
than
I
should
be
for
not
want
a
leg
or
an
arm
;
which
no
man
in
his
wit
would
boast
of
,
although
he
must
be
miserable
without
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
dwell
the
longer
upon
this
subject
from
the
desire
I
have
to
make
the
society
of
an
English
Yahoo
by
any
mean
not
insupportable
;
and
therefore
I
here
entreat
those
who
have
any
tincture
of
this
absurd
vice
,
that
they
will
not
presume
to
come
in
my
sight
.
