<EOS>
on
the
look
out
.
 
<EOS>
in
these
time
of
our
,
though
concern
the
exact
year
there
be
no
need
to
be
precise
,
a
boat
of
dirty
and
disreputable
appearance
,
with
two
figure
in
it
,
float
on
the
Thames
,
between
Southwark
Bridge
which
be
of
iron
,
and
London
Bridge
which
be
of
stone
,
as
an
autumn
evening
be
close
in
.
  
<EOS>
the
figure
in
this
boat
be
those
of
a
strong
man
with
ragged
grizzled
hair
and
a
sun
-
brown
face
,
and
a
dark
girl
of
nineteen
or
twenty
,
sufficiently
like
him
to
be
recognizable
as
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
the
girl
row
,
pull
a
pair
of
scull
very
easily
;
the
man
,
with
the
rudder
-
line
slack
in
his
hand
,
and
his
hand
loose
in
his
waistband
,
keep
an
eager
look
out
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
net
,
hook
,
or
line
,
and
he
could
not
be
a
fisherman
;
his
boat
have
no
cushion
for
a
sitter
,
no
paint
,
no
inscription
,
no
appliance
beyond
a
rusty
boathook
and
a
coil
or
rope
,
and
he
could
not
be
a
waterman
;
his
boat
be
too
crazy
and
too
small
to
take
in
cargo
for
delivery
,
and
he
could
not
be
a
lighterman
or
river
-
carrier
;
there
be
no
clue
to
what
he
look
for
,
but
he
look
for
something
,
with
a
most
intent
and
search
gaze
.
<EOS>
the
tide
,
which
have
turn
an
hour
before
,
be
run
down
,
and
his
eye
watch
every
little
race
and
eddy
in
its
broad
sweep
,
as
the
boat
make
slight
head
-
way
against
it
,
or
drive
stern
foremost
before
it
,
accord
as
he
direct
his
daughter
by
a
movement
of
his
head
.
<EOS>
She
watch
his
face
as
earnestly
as
he
watch
the
river
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
the
intensity
of
her
look
there
be
a
touch
of
dread
or
horror
.
  
<EOS>
ally
to
the
bottom
of
the
river
rather
than
the
surface
,
by
reason
of
the
slime
and
ooze
with
which
it
be
cover
,
and
its
sodden
state
,
this
boat
and
the
two
figure
in
it
obviously
be
do
something
that
they
often
do
,
and
be
seek
what
they
often
seek
.
<EOS>
half
savage
as
the
man
show
,
with
no
covering
on
his
matted
head
,
with
his
brown
arm
bare
to
between
the
elbow
and
the
shoulder
,
with
the
loose
knot
of
a
looser
kerchief
lie
low
on
his
bare
breast
in
a
wilderness
of
beard
and
whisker
,
with
such
dress
as
he
wear
seem
to
be
make
out
of
the
mud
that
begrime
his
boat
,
still
there
be
business
-
like
usage
in
his
steady
gaze
.
<EOS>
so
with
every
lithe
action
of
the
girl
,
with
every
turn
of
her
wrist
,
perhaps
most
of
all
with
her
look
of
dread
or
horror
;
they
be
thing
of
usage
.
  
<EOS>
"
keep
her
out
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Tide
run
strong
here
.
<EOS>
keep
her
well
afore
the
sweep
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
trust
to
the
girl
's
skill
and
make
no
use
of
the
rudder
,
he
eye
the
come
tide
with
an
absorb
attention
.
<EOS>
so
the
girl
eye
him
.
<EOS>
but
,
it
happen
now
,
that
a
slant
of
light
from
the
set
sun
glance
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
,
and
,
touch
a
rotten
stain
there
which
bear
some
resemblance
to
the
outline
of
a
muffled
human
form
,
colour
it
as
though
with
diluted
blood
.
<EOS>
this
catch
the
girl
's
eye
,
and
she
shiver
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
ail
you
?
"
say
the
man
,
immediately
aware
of
it
,
though
so
intent
on
the
advance
water
;
"
I
see
nothing
afloat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
red
light
be
go
,
the
shudder
be
go
,
and
his
gaze
,
which
have
come
back
to
the
boat
for
a
moment
,
travel
away
again
.
<EOS>
wheresoever
the
strong
tide
meet
with
an
impediment
,
his
gaze
pause
for
an
instant
.
<EOS>
at
every
mooring
-
chain
and
rope
,
at
every
stationary
boat
or
barge
that
split
the
current
into
a
broad
-
arrow
-
head
,
at
the
offset
from
the
pier
of
Southwark
Bridge
,
at
the
paddle
of
the
river
steamboat
as
they
beat
the
filthy
water
,
at
the
float
log
of
timber
lash
together
lie
off
certain
wharf
,
his
shine
eye
dart
a
hungry
look
.
<EOS>
after
a
darkening
hour
or
so
,
suddenly
the
rudder
-
line
tighten
in
his
hold
,
and
he
steer
hard
towards
the
Surrey
shore
.
  
<EOS>
always
watch
his
face
,
the
girl
instantly
answer
to
the
action
in
her
sculling
;
presently
the
boat
swing
round
,
quiver
as
from
a
sudden
jerk
,
and
the
upper
half
of
the
man
be
stretch
out
over
the
stern
.
  
<EOS>
the
girl
pull
the
hood
of
a
cloak
she
wear
,
over
her
head
and
over
her
face
,
and
,
look
backward
so
that
the
front
fold
of
this
hood
be
turn
down
the
river
,
keep
the
boat
in
that
direction
go
before
the
tide
.
<EOS>
until
now
,
the
boat
have
barely
hold
her
own
,
and
have
hover
about
one
spot
;
but
now
,
the
bank
change
swiftly
,
and
the
deepen
shadow
and
the
kindle
light
of
London
Bridge
be
pass
,
and
the
tier
of
shipping
lie
on
either
hand
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
now
that
the
upper
half
of
the
man
come
back
into
the
boat
.
<EOS>
His
arm
be
wet
and
dirty
,
and
he
wash
them
over
the
side
.
<EOS>
in
his
right
hand
he
hold
something
,
and
he
wash
that
in
the
river
too
.
<EOS>
It
be
money
.
<EOS>
He
chink
it
once
,
and
he
blow
upon
it
once
,
and
he
spit
upon
it
once
,
---
"
for
luck
,
"
he
hoarsely
say
---
before
he
put
it
in
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
girl
turn
her
face
towards
him
with
a
start
,
and
row
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Her
face
be
very
pale
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
hook
-
nosed
man
,
and
with
that
and
his
bright
eye
and
his
ruffled
head
,
bear
a
certain
likeness
to
a
roused
bird
of
prey
.
  
<EOS>
"
take
that
thing
off
your
face
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
put
it
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
!
<EOS>
and
give
me
hold
of
the
scull
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
the
rest
of
the
spell

"
no

<EOS>
I
can

<EOS>
Father

so
near

"
  
<EOS>
He
be
move
towards
her
to
change
place
but
her
terrified
expostulation
stop
him
and
he
resume
his
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
hurt
can
it
do
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
none
,
none
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
belief
<EOS>
you
hate
the
sight
of
the
very
river

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
do
not
like
it

<EOS>
"
as

"
  
<EOS>
at
these
latter
word
the
girl
shiver
again
,
and
for
a
moment
pause
in
her
rowing
,
seem
to
turn
deadly
faint
.
<EOS>
It
escape
his
attention
,
for
he
be
glance
over
the
stern
at
something
the
boat
have
in
tow
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
be
so
thankless
to
your
good
friend

<EOS>
the
very
fire
that
warm
you
when
you
be
a
babby
,
be
pick
out
of
the
river
alongside
the
coal
barge
.
<EOS>
the
very
basket
that
you
sleep
in
,
the
tide
wash
ashore
.
<EOS>
the
very
rocker
that
I
put
it
upon
to
make
a
cradle
of
it
,
I
cut
out
of
a
piece
of
wood

<EOS>
Lizzie
take
her
right
hand
from
the
scull
it
hold
,
and
touch
her
lip
with
it
,
and
for
a
moment
hold
it
out
lovingly
towards
him
;
 
then
,
without
speak
,
she
resume
her
rowing
,
as
another
boat
of
similar
appearance
,
though
in
rather
better
trim
,
come
out
from
a
dark
place
and
drop
softly
alongside

<EOS>
"
in
luck
again

say
a
man
with
a
squinting
leer
,
who
scull
her
and
who
be
alone
.
<EOS>
"
I
know'd
<EOS>

down

drily

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
now
a
tender
yellow
moonlight
on
the
river
,
and
the
new
comer
,
keep
half
his
boat
's
length
astern
of
the
other
boat

look
hard
at
its
track

<EOS>
"
this
be
in
answer
to
a
quick
impatient
movement
on
the
part
of
Gaffer
:
the
speaker
at
the
same
time
unship
his
scull
on
that
side
,
and
lay
his
hand
on
the
gunwale
of
Gaffer
's
boat
and
hold
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
He

<EOS>
He

have
pass
me
when

He
speak
in
a
drop
voice
,
and
with
more
than
one
glance
at
Lizzie
who
have
pull
on
her
hood
again

<EOS>
both
man
then
look
with
a
weird
unholy

in
so
surly
a

a
blank
stare

with
the
retort
:

desert

dart
at

with
:

"
  
<EOS>
when
the
first
shock
fall
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Twemlow
twice
skip
back
in
his
neat
little
shoe
and
his
little
silk
stocking
of
a
bygone
fashion
,
as
if
impel
to
leap
over
a
sofa
behind
him
;
but
the
large
man
close
with
him
and
prove
too
strong
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
,
"
say
the
large
man
,
try
to
attract
the
attention
of
his

in

distance

"
have
the
pleasure
of
present
Mrs.

to
her
host

<EOS>
She
will
be

"
in
his
fatal
freshness
he
seem
to
find
perpetual
verdure
and
eternal
youth

the
phrase
,
"
she
will
be
so
glad
of

"
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
Mrs.
Podsnap
,
unable
to
originate
a
mistake
on
her
own
account
,
because
Mrs.
Veneering
be
the
only
other
lady
there
,
do
her
good
in
the
way
of
handsomely
support
her
husband
's
,
by
look
towards
Mr.
Twemlow
with
a
plaintive
countenance
and
remark
to
Mrs.
veneer
in
a
feeling
manner
,
firstly
,
that
she
fear
he
have
be
rather
bilious
of
late
,
and
,
secondly
,
that
the
baby
be
already
very
like
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
questionable
whether
any
man
quite
relish
be
mistake
for
any
other
man
;
but
,
Mr.
Veneering
have
this
very
evening
set
up
the
shirt

of
the
young
Antinous

be
not

all
compliment
by
be
suppose
to
be
Twemlow
,
who
be
dry
and
weazen
and
some
thirty
year
old
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
veneer
equally
resent
the
imputation
of
be
the
wife
of
Twemlow
.
<EOS>
as
to
Twemlow
,
he
be
so
sensible
of
be
a
much
better
breed
man
than
Veneering
,
that
he
consider
the
large
man
an
offensive
ass
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
complicated
dilemma
,
Mr.
Veneering
approach
the
large
man
with
extended
hand
and
,
smilingly
assure
that
incorrigible
personage
that
he
be
delighted
to
see
him
:
who
in
his
fatal
freshness
instantly
reply
:
  
"
thank
you
.
<EOS>
I
be
ashamed
to
say
that
I
can
not
at
this
moment
recall
where
we
meet
,
but
I
be
so
glad
of
this
opportunity
,
I
be
sure
!
"
  
<EOS>
then
pounce
upon
Twemlow
,
who
hold
back
with
all
his
feeble
might
,
he
be
hale
him
off
to
present
him
,
as
veneering

to
Mrs.
Podsnap
,
when
the
arrival
of
more
guest
unravel
the
mistake

<EOS>
Whereupon

so
glad

<EOS>
now
,
Twemlow
have
undergo
this
terrific
experience
,
have
likewise
note
the
fusion
of
boot
in

wholesomely
harden
as
he
approach
the
conclusion
that

through

I
believe
that
be

choose

should
have

this

indeed

the

seem
conscious
of
his

generally
come
before

after
some
discussion
on

merit
of

Mrs.

It
be
one
of

He
have
not
only
settle
it
with
himself
in
course
of
time
,
that
he
be
errand
-
goer
by
appointment
to
the
house
at
the
corner
(
though
he
receive
such
commission
not
half
a
dozen
time
in
a
year
,
and
then
only
as
some
servant
's
deputy
)
,
but
also
that
he
be
one
of
the
house
's
retainer
and
owe
vassalage
to
it
and
be
bind
to
leal
and
loyal
interest
in

<EOS>
for
this
reason
,
he
always
speak
of
it
as
"
Our

and
,
though
his
knowledge
of
its
affair
be
mostly
speculative
and
all
wrong
,
claim
to
be
in
its
confidence
.
<EOS>
on
similar
ground
he
never
beheld
an
inmate
at
any
one
of
its
window
but
he
touch
his
hat
.
<EOS>
yet
,
he
know
so
little
about
the
inmate
that
he
give
them
name
of
his
own
invention

as
"
Miss
Elizabeth

"
"
Master
George

"
"
Aunt

,
"
"
Uncle
Parker
"
---
have
no
authority
whatever
for
any
such
designation
,
but
particularly
the
last
---
to
which
,
as
a
natural
consequence
,
he
stick
with
great
obstinacy
.
  
<EOS>
over
the
house
itself
,
he
exercise
the
same
imaginary
power
as
over
its
inhabitant
and
their
affair
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
be
in
it
,
the
length
of
a
piece
of
fat
black
water
-
pipe
which
trail
itself
over
the
area
-
door
into
a
damp
stone
passage
,
and
have
rather
the
air
of
a
leech
on
the
house
that
have
"
take
"
wonderfully
;
but
this
be
no
impediment
to
his
arranging
it
accord
to
a
plan
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
dingy
house
with
a
quantity
of
dim
side
window
and
blank
back
premise
,
and
it
cost
his
mind
a
world
of
trouble
so
to
lay
it
out
as
to
account
for
everything
in
its
external
appearance
.
<EOS>
but
,
this
once
do
,
be
quite
satisfactory
,
and
he
rest
persuade
,
that
he
know
his
way
about
the
house
blindfold
:
from
the
bar
garret
in
the
high
roof
,
to
the
two
iron
extinguisher
before
the
main
door
---
which
seem
to
request
all
lively
visitor
to
have
the
kindness
to
put
themselves
out
,
before
enter

<EOS>
assuredly
,

It

his
apple

stomach
-
ache

look
at
his
orange

the
toothache

at
his
nut

<EOS>
of
the
latter
commodity
he

always
a
grim
little
heap

on
which

a
little
wooden

knotty
man

and
a
close

with
a
face
carve

of
very
hard

<EOS>
Sooth
to
say
,
he
be
so
wooden
a
man
that
he
seem
to
have
take
his
wooden
leg
naturally
,
and
rather
suggest
to
the
fanciful
observer
,
that
he
may
be
expect
---
if
his
development
receive
no
untimely
check
---
to
be
completely
set
up
with
a
pair
of
wooden
leg
in
about
six
month

a
slight
touch
of
the
shady
preliminary
meditation
at
church
;
to
the
doctor
,
a
confidential
bow

as
to
a

<EOS>
the

Mr.

all

get
rather

to
leave

not

<EOS>
for

,
in
combination
with
the
fact
that
the

be

afloat
at
high

not

the

the

no

gently
appeal

it

to

many

could
riderhood
himself
have
do
the
murder

do
he
purposely
let
father
find
the
body

wicked

cruel

so

such
a

now
that

throw
it
upon

I
go
back

it

it

it
be

that
be
put

ask
this

rather
of

look
round

troubled

,
Miss

the

Mr.

the
point
:

look
round
for

in

workmanlike
manner

by
his
rib

on

Mr.

on
his
take

and
not

a
temptation

suspicion

force
construction

Lightwood
feel
his

<EOS>

I
beg

Mr.

exactly
so

nothing
can
be
more
laudable

be
the
tightness

I

<EOS>
so

he
have
several

<EOS>
for

<EOS>
concede
for
a
moment
that
there
be
any
analogy
between

and
a
man
in
a
shirt
and
pantaloon
(
which
I
deny
)
,
and
that
it
be
settle
that
the
man
be
to
learn
from
the
bee
(
which
I
also
deny

the
question
still
remain
,
what
be
he
to
learn

<EOS>
to
imitate

to
avoid

<EOS>
when
your

themselves

about

become
perfectly
distract

the

to
learn
the
greatness
of

the
littleness
of
the
Court
Circular
?

I
be
not
clear
,
Mr.

that

may
be

gradually
tone
down
to
a
motherly
strain

last

I

now
that

He

I

I

Mrs.

at
the
Reverend
Frank

<EOS>
and
I
believe
my
husband
will
agree
with
me
when
he
consider
it
again
---
that
you
could
possibly
keep
that
orphan
clean
from
snuff

<EOS>
because
his
grandmother
take
so
many
ounce
,
and
drop
it
over
him

"
  
<EOS>

but
he
would
not
be

his
grandmother
then
,
Margaretta
,
"
 
say
Mr.
Milvey
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Frank
,
but
it
would
be
impossible
to
keep
her
from
Mrs.
Boffin
's
house
;
and
the
more
there
be
to
eat
and
drink
there
,
the
oftener
she
would
go
.
<EOS>
and
she
be
an
inconvenient
woman

<EOS>
I
hope
it
be
not
uncharitable
to
remember
that
last
Christmas
Eve
<EOS>
she
drink
eleven
cup
of
tea
,
and
grumble
all
the
time

<EOS>
and
she

not

<EOS>
You
recollect
her

one

no

which
Mrs.

at

<EOS>
accordingly
,
it
be
resolve

search
for
an

likely
to
suit

as
free

should
communicate
again
with

then
,
Mr.

take
the
liberty
of
mention
to
Mr.

would
do
him
the
kindness
to
be
perpetually
his
banker
to
the
extent

whether
it
render

free
him

be

dark
to

at

time
he
occupy
a

she
have
set
her

We
now
come
,

say
veneering

"
to
the
point
,
the
real
point

of
our
little
family
consultation
.
<EOS>
Sophronia
,
have
lose
both
father

have
no

<EOS>

give

away
yourself
,
"

Podsnap

<EOS>
"
My
dear
podsnap
,
no
.
<EOS>
for
three
reason
.
<EOS>
firstly
,
because
I
could
not
take
so
much
upon
myself
when
I
have
respect
family
friend
to
remember
.
<EOS>
secondly
,
because
I
be
not
so
vain
as
to
think
that
I
look
the
part
.
<EOS>
thirdly
,
because
Anastatia
be
a
little
superstitious
on
the
subject
and
feel
averse
to
my
give
away
anybody
until
baby
be
old
enough
to
be
marry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
would
happen
if
he
do
?
<EOS>
"
podsnap
inquire
of
Mrs.
Veneering
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mr.
Podsnap
,
it
be
very
foolish
<EOS>
I
know
,
<EOS>
but
I
have
an
instinctive
presentiment
that
if
Hamilton
give
away
anybody
else
first
,
he
would
never
give
away
baby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
thus
Mrs.
Veneering
;
with
her
open
hand
press
together
,
and
each
of
her
eight
aquiline
finger
look
so
very
like
her
one
aquiline
nose
that
the
bran
-
new
jewel
on
them
seem
necessary
for
distinction
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
my
dear
Podsnap
,
"
quoth
Veneering
,
"
there
be
a
try
friend
of
our
family
who
,
I
think
and
hope
you
will
agree
with
me
,
Podsnap
,
be
the
friend
on
whom
this
agreeable
duty
almost
naturally
devolve

<EOS>
that
friend
,
"
say
the
word
as

the

be
about
a
hundred

fifty

be
now

<EOS>
that
friend
be
Twemlow

<EOS>
"
  
"
certainly
!
"
<EOS>
from
Podsnap

<EOS>
"
that
friend
,
"
veneer
repeat
with
great
firmness
,
"
be
our
dear
good
twemlow
.
<EOS>
and
I
can
not
sufficiently
express
to
you
,
my
dear
Podsnap
,
the
pleasure
I
feel
in
have
this
opinion
of
mine
and
Anastatia
's
so
readily
confirm
by
you
,
that
other
equally
familiar
and
try
friend
who
stand
in
the
proud
position
---
I
mean
who
proudly
stand
in
the
position
---
<EOS>
or
I
ought
rather
to
say
,
who
place
Anastatia
and
myself
in
the
proud
position
of
himself
stand
in
the
simple
position
---
of
baby
's
godfather
.
"
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
veneering
be
much
relieve
in
mind
to
find
that
podsnap
betray
no
jealousy
of
Twemlow
's
elevation
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
it
have
come
to
pass
that
the
spring

rosy

on

and
that
Twemlow

he
be

play
his
distinguished
part
to

<EOS>
He
have
already
be
to
the
church
,
and
take
note
of
the
various
impediment
in
the
aisle
,
under
the
auspex
of
an
extremely
dreary
widow
who
open
the
pew

acute
rheumatism
,
but
be
in

voluntarily
double
up
to
act

<EOS>
and
now

<EOS>
while
peruse

Twemlow
make
some
opaque

,
after
this
introduction
,
to

they
will

after

and
have

by

<EOS>
and
after

in
the
way
of
business
at
so
much
a
head
.
<EOS>
the
bride
and
bridegroom
talk
and
laugh
apart
,
as
have
always
be
their
manner
;
and
the
Buffers
work
their
way
through
the
dish
with
systematic
perseverance
,
as
have
always
be
their
manner
;
and
the
pokey
unknown
be
exceedingly
benevolent
to
one
another
in
invitation
to
take
glass
of
champagne
;
but
<EOS>
Mrs.
Podsnap
,
arch
her
mane
and
rock
her
grand
,
have
a
far
more
deferential
audience
than
Mrs.
Veneering
;
 
and
Podsnap
all
but
do
the
honour
.
  
<EOS>
another
dismal
circumstance
be
,
that
veneering
,
have
the
captivate
tippin
on
one
side
of
him
and
the
bride
's
aunt
on
the
other
,
find
it
immensely
difficult
to
keep
the
peace
.
<EOS>
for
,
Medusa
,
besides
unmistakingly
glaring
petrifaction
at
the
fascinating
Tippins
,
follow
every
lively
remark
make
by
that
dear
creature
,
with
an
audible
snort
:
which
may
be
referable
to
a
chronic
cold
in
the
head
,
but
may
also
be
referable
to
indignation
and
contempt
.
<EOS>
and
this
snort
be
regular
in
its
reproduction
,
at
length
come
to
be
expect
by
the
company
,
who
make
embarrassing
pause
when
it
be
fall
due
,
and
by
wait
for
it
,
render
it
more
emphatic
when
it
come
.
<EOS>
the
stoney
aunt
have
likewise
an
injurious
way
of
reject
all
dish
<EOS>
whereof
Lady
Tippins
partake
:
say
aloud
when
they
be
proffer
to
her
,
"
no
,
no
,
no
,
not
for
me
.
<EOS>
take
it
away
!
"
<EOS>
as
with
a
set
purpose
of
imply
a
misgiving
that
if
nourish
upon
similar
meat
,
she
may
come
to
be
like
that
charmer
,
which
would
be
a
fatal
consummation
.
<EOS>
aware
of
her
enemy
,
Lady
Tippins
try
a
youthful
sally
or
two
,
and
try
the
eye
-
glass
;
but
,
from
the
impenetrable
cap
and
snorting
armour
of
the
stoney
aunt
all
weapon
rebound
powerless
.
  
<EOS>
another
objectionable
circumstance
be
,
that
the
pokey
unknown
support
each
other
in
be
unimpressible
.
<EOS>
They
persist
in
not
be
frighten
by
the
gold
and
silver
camel
,
and
they
be
band
together
to
defy
the
elaborately
chase
ice
-
pail
.
<EOS>
They
even
seem
to
unite
in
some
vague
utterance
of
the
sentiment
that
the
landlord
and
landlady
will
make
a
pretty
good
profit
out
of
this
,
and
they
almost
carry
themselves
like
customer
.
<EOS>
nor
be
there
compensate
influence
in
the
adorable
bridesmaid
;
for
,
have
very
little
interest
in
the
bride
,
and
none
at
all
in
one
another
,
those
lovely
being
become
,
each
one
on
her
own
account
,
depreciatingly
contemplative
of
the
millinery
present
;
while
the
bridegroom
's
man
,
exhaust
,
in
the
back
of
his
chair
,
appear
to
be
improve
the
occasion
by
penitentially
contemplate
all
the
wrong
he
have
ever
do
;
the
difference
between
him
and
his
friend
Eugene
,
be
,
that
the
latter
,
in
the
back
of
his
chair
,
appear
to
be
contemplate
all
the
wrong
he
would
like
to
do
---
  
particularly
to
the
present
company
.
  
<EOS>
in
which
state
of
affair
,
the
usual
ceremony
rather
droop
and
flag
,
and
the
splendid
cake
when
cut
by
the
fair
hand
of
the
bride
have
but
an
indigestible
appearance
.
<EOS>
however
,
all
the
thing
indispensable
to
be
say
be
say
,
and
all
the
thing
indispensable
to
be
do
be
do
(
include
Lady
Tippins
's
yawning
,
fall
asleep
,
and
wake
insensible
)
,
and
there
be
hurried
preparation
for
the
nuptial
journey
to
the
Isle
of
Wight
,
and
the
outer
air
teem
with
brass
band
and
spectator

<EOS>
in
full

of
whom
,
the
malignant
star
of
the
Analytical
have
pre

ordain
that
pain
and
ridicule
shall
befall
him
.
<EOS>
for
he
,
stand
on
the
doorstep
to
grace
the
departure
,
be
suddenly
catch
a
most
prodigious
thump
on
the
side
of
his
head
with
a
heavy
shoe
,
which
a
Buffer
in
the
hall
,
champagne

flush
and
wild
of

have
borrow
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
from
the
pastrycook

porter
,
to
cast
after
the
depart
pair
as
an
auspicious
oman

<EOS>
so
they
all
go
up
again
into
the
gorgeous
drawing

room
---
<EOS>
all
of
them
flush
with
breakfast
,
as
have
take
scarlatina
sociably

and
there
the

do
malignant
thing
with
their
leg
to
ottomans
,
and
take
as
much
as
possible
out

<EOS>
and
so
,
Lady

,
quite
undetermined
whether

Mortimer

the
stoney

go
away
<EOS>

she
decline

prove

and
even
the

be
slowly

off

and
it
be
all
over

<EOS>
all
over
,
that
be
to
say
,
for
the
time
being

<EOS>
but
,
there
be
another
time
to
come
,
and
it
come
in
about
a
fortnight
,
and
it
come
to
Mr.

Mrs.

on
the
sand
at
Shanklin

in
the
Isle

.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Lammle
have
walk
for
some
time
on
the
Shanklin
sand
,
and
one
may
see
by
their
footprint
that
they
have
not
walk
arm
in
arm
,
and
that
they
have
not
walk
in
a
straight
track
,
and
that
they
have
walk
in
a
moody
humour
;
for
,
the
lady
have
prod
little
spirt
hole
in
the
damp
sand
before
her
with
her
parasol
,
and
the
gentleman
have
trail
his
stick
after
him
.
<EOS>
as
if
he
be
of
the
Mephistopheles
family
indeed
,
and
have
walk
with

<EOS>
"

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.

fall
silent
again
,
and
they
walk
as
before
.
<EOS>
Mrs.

Mr.

He

the

<EOS>
His
colour
have
turn
to
a
livid
white

ominous
mark
have
come
to
light
about
his
nose

as

within

<EOS>
Whereupon
she
call
him

rage

so

broken

She

then
she
say
that
if
she

courage

she
would
do
it

<EOS>
then
she
call
him

<EOS>
then
she
ask
him

why

in
the
disappointment

his
base
speculation

her
life

the

Miss

altogether
of

for
,
Mr.

be
likely
to
get
little
good
out

restrict

<EOS>
Miss
Podsnap
's
early
view
of
life
be
principally
derive
from
the
reflection

it
in
her
father

boot
,
and
in
the
walnut
and
rosewood
table
of
the
dim
drawing
-
room
,
and
in
their
swarthy
giant
of
looking
-
glass
,
be
of
a
sombre
cast
;
and
it
be
not
wonderful
that
now
,
when
she
be
on
most
day
solemnly
tool
through
the
Park
by
the
side
of
her
mother
in
a
great
tall
custard

colour
phaeton
<EOS>
,
she
show
above
the
apron

that
vehicle
like
a
dejected
young

sit
up
in

to
take
a
startled
look
at
thing
in
general

very
strongly
desire

they
successfully
dispose

for

Mrs.

look
in

<EOS>
have
deliver

he
think
of
the
remote
possibility
of
its
being
at
all
qualify
by
any
prejudice
citizen
of
any
other
country

and
,
with

favorite
right

arm
flourish

he
put

the
whole

<EOS>
the
audience
be
much
edify

passage

and
Mr.

feel
that
he
be
in
rather
remarkable
force
to
-
day
,
become
smile
and
conversational
.
  
<EOS>

have
anything
more

veneer

nothing
more

than
that

property

<EOS>
I
be
tell
people
now
call
him
the
Golden
Dustman

<EOS>
I
mention
to
you
some
time

I
think
,
that

"
yes

you
tell
me
that
,

"
and
by
-
the
-
bye
,
I
wish
you
would
tell
it
again
here
,
for
it
be
a
curious
coincidence
---
curious
that
the
first
news
of
the
discovery
should
have
be
bring
straight
to
your
table
(
when
I
be
there
)
,
and
curious
that
one
of
your
people
should
have
be
so
nearly
interested
in
it
.
<EOS>
just
relate
that
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
veneering
be
more
than
ready
to
do
it
,
for
he
have
prosper
exceedingly
upon
the
Harmon
Murder
,
and
have
turn
the
social
distinction
it
confer
upon
him
to
the
account
of
make
several
dozen
of
bran
-
new
bosom
-
friend
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
such
another
lucky
hit
would
almost
have
set
him
up
in
that
way
to
his
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
so
,
address
himself
to
the
most
desirable
of
his
neighbour
,
while
Mrs.
Veneering
secure
the
next
most
desirable
,
he
plunge
into
the
case
,
and
emerge
from
it
twenty
minute
afterwards
with
a
Bank
Director
in
his
arm
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
Mrs.
Veneering
have
dive
into
the
same
water
for
a
wealthy
Ship
-
Broker
,
and
have
bring
him
up
,
safe
and
sound
,
by
the
hair
.
<EOS>
then
Mrs.
Veneering
have
to
relate
,
to
a
large
circle
,
how
she
have
be
to
see
the
girl
,
and
how
she
be
really
pretty
,
and
(
consider
her
station
)
presentable
.
<EOS>
and
this
she
do
with
such
a
successful
display
of
her
eight
aquiline
finger
and
their
encircling
jewel
,
that
she
happily
lay
hold
of
a
drift
General
Officer
,
his
wife
and
daughter
,
and
not
only
restore
their
animation
which
have
become
suspend
,
but
make
them
lively
friend
within
an
hour
.
  
<EOS>
although
Mr.
Podsnap
would
in
a
general
way
have
highly
disapprove
of
body
in
river
as
ineligible
topic
with
reference
to
the
cheek
of
the
young
person
,
he
have
,
as
one
may
say
,
a
share
in
this
affair
which
make
him
a
part
proprietor
.
<EOS>
as
its
return
be
immediate
,
too
,
in
the
way
of
restrain
the
company
from
speechless
contemplation
of
the
wine
-
cooler
,
it
pay

and
he
be
satisfied

<EOS>
and
now
the
haunch
of
mutton
vapour

bath
have
receive
a
gamey
infusion
,
and
a
few
last
touch
of
sweet
and
coffee
,
be
quite
ready
,
and
the
bather
come
;
but
not
before
the
discreet
automaton
have
get
behind
the
bar
of
the
piano
music

desk
,
and
there
present
the
appearance

a
captive
languishing
in

rosewood
jail

now
so
pleasant

so
well
assort

all
gracious
contentment

both
at
occasional
interval
exchange
look
like
partner
at
card
who
play
a
game
against
All
England

<EOS>
there
be
not
much
youth
among
the
bather
,
but
there
be
no
youth
(
the
young
person
always
except
)
in
the
article
of
Podsnappery
.
<EOS>
bald
bather
fold
their
arm
and
talk
to
Mr.
Podsnap
on
the
hearthrug
;
sleek
-
whisker
bather
,
with
hat
in
their
hand
,
lunge
at
Mrs.
Podsnap
and
retreat
;
prowl
bather
,
go
about
look
into
ornamental
box
and
bowl
as
if
they
have
suspicion
of
larceny
on
the
part
of
the
Podsnaps
,
and
expect
to
find
something
they
have
lose
at
the
bottom
;
bather
of
the
gentler
sex
sit
silently
compare
ivory
shoulder
.
<EOS>
all
this
time
and
always
,
poor
little
Miss
Podsnap
,
whose
tiny
effort
(
if
she
have
make
any
)
be
swallow
up
in
the
magnificence
of
her
mother
's
rocking
,
keep
herself
as
much
out
of
sight
and
mind
as
she
could
,
and
appear
to
be
count
on
many
dismal
return
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
It
be
somehow
understand
,
as
a
secret
article
in
the
state
propriety
of
podsnappery
that
nothing
must
be
say
about
the
day
.
<EOS>
consequently
this
young
damsel
's
nativity
be
hush
up
and
look
over
,
as
if
it
be
agree
on
all
hand
that
it
would
have
be
well
that
she
have
never
be
bear

<EOS>
the
Lammles
be
so
fond
of
the
dear
veneering
that
they
could
not
for
some
time
detach
themselves
from
those
excellent
friend
;
but
at
length
,
either
a
very
open
smile
on
Mr.
Lammle
's
part
,
or
a
very
secret
elevation
of
one
of
his
gingerous
eyebrow
---
 
certainly
the
one
or
the
other
---
seem
to
say
to
Mrs.
Lammle
,
"
why
do
not
you
play
?
"
<EOS>
and
so
,
look
about
her

she
see
Miss

seem
to
say
responsively

that
card

to
be

in

dozen

as

starvation

force
upon

culprit

as
if
,
in
their
wretched
manner

they
have
make
their
weak
protest

it

they
would
have
take
the
liberty

stave
it
off

it

Mr.

<EOS>
"
easy

I

<EOS>
He
be
not
aware

that
he

drive
at
any

<EOS>
He
have
no

he
certainly
be
more
staggered

these
terrible

many

may
he

<EOS>
"
You

say
Mr.

<EOS>
the

you

with
severity

It

render

cautious

<EOS>
in

to
that
absurd

for

Mr.

he
the

no

feel

down

so
he
say
:

forcibly

add
by

say
Mr.

flush
high
up

I
will
go
so
far

He
finish
with
that
flourish
of
his
arm

add
more
expressively

I
remove
it
from

<EOS>
simultaneously

Charming
to
see
Mr.

take
leave
so
gracefully
,
and
go
down
the
stair
so
lovingly
and
sweetly
.
<EOS>
not
quite
so
charming
to
see
their
smile
face
fall
and
brood
as
they
drop
moodily
into
separate
corner
of
their
little
carriage
.
<EOS>
but
to
be
sure
that
be
a
sight
behind
the
scene
,
which
nobody
see
,
and
which
nobody
be
mean
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
certain
big
,
heavy
vehicle

build
on
the
model
of
the
Podsnap
plate

take
away
the
heavy
article
of
guest

ever
so
much
;
and
the
less
valuable
article
get
away
after
their
various
manner
;
and
the
Podsnap

be
put
to
bed

<EOS>
as
Mr.
Podsnap
stand
with
his
back
to
the
drawing

room
fire

pull
up
his
shirt
-
collar
,
like
a
veritable
cock
of
the
walk
literally
plume
himself
in
the
midst
of
his
possession
,
nothing
would
have
astonish
him
more
than
an
intimation
that
Miss
Podsnap
,
or
any
other
young
person
properly
bear
and
breed
,
could
not
be
exactly
put
away
like
the
plate

bring
out
like
the
plate
,
polish
like
the
plate
,
count
,
weigh
,
and
value
like
the
plate

<EOS>
that
such
a
young
person
could
possibly
have
a
morbid
vacancy
in
the
heart
for
anything
young
than
the
plate
,
or
less
monotonous
than
the
plate
;
or
that
such
a
young

's
thought
could
try
to
scale
the
region
bound
on
the
north
,
south
,
east
,

west
,
by
the
plate

be
a
monstrous
imagination

he
would
on

spot
have
flourish
into

this
perhaps
in

arise

all
cheek

there
be
a

short
dialogue

You

yes

twenty
last
October

then
I
put
it
to

regard
the

it

from

touch
his

<EOS>

`
`
It
be
a
pot
of
money

be
it
a
sin
for
a
labour
man
that
moisten
every
crust
of
bread
he
earn

with
his

there
be
anything
again

it

"
<EOS>
"
this
I
put
to
myself
strong
,
as
in

`

how
can
it
be

without
blame
Lawyer
Lightwood

offer
it

certainly
not

so
I
make
up
my

off

my

what

out

what

more

he

suddenly

bloodthirsty

I
mean

have
it

now
I
tell
you

Mr.

reply
,
with
due
generality

reticence

that
it
be
always
more
likely
that
a

have
do
a
bad

that

have
not

<EOS>
that
he
himself
have
several
time

reckon
up
"

have
never

him
to
a
satisfactory
criminal
total

that

it

true

that
the

very
shy

would
have
be
jointly

pretty
equally
"
in

that
this

have
"
spot
"
the
other
,
to
save
himself
and
get
the
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
think
,
"
add
Mr.

in
conclusion
,
"
that
if
all
go
well
with

he
be
in

tolerable
way

get
it

its

up
the
iron
vessel

give
it
one
delicate
twirl

cause
it

send
forth
one

admit

have
not

only
it
have

regard

divest
of
its

shadow

his
report
go
to
the
effect
that
Gaffer
be
away

his
boat

suppose
to
be
on
his
old
look

out

that
he
have
be
expect
last
high

that
have

it

some
reason

other

he
be
not
,
accord
to
his
usual
habit
at
night

to
be
count
on
before
next
high
-
water
,
or
it
may
be
an
hour
or
so
later
;
that
his
daughter
,
survey
through
the
window
,
would
seem
to
be
so
expect
him
,
for
the
supper
be
not
cook
,
but
set
out
ready
to
be
cook
;
that
it
would
be
highwat
at
about
one
,
and
that
it
be
now
barely
ten
;
that
there
be
nothing
to
be
do
but
watch
and
wait
;
that
the
informer
be
keep
watch
at
the
instant
of
that
present
report
,
but
that
two
head
be
well
than
one
<EOS>
(
especially
when
the
second
be
Mr.
Inspector

)
;
and
that
the
reporter
mean
to
share
the
watch
.
<EOS>
and
forasmuch
as
crouch
under
the
lee
of
a
haul
-
up
boat
on
a
night
when
it
blow
cold
and
strong
,
and
when
the
weather
be
varied
with
blast
of
hail
at
time
,
may
be
wearisome
to
amateur
,
the
reporter
close
with
the
recommendation
that
the
two
gentleman
should
remain
,
for
a
while
at
any
rate
,
in
their
present
quarter
,
which
be
weather
-
tight
and
warm
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
not
inclined
to
dispute
this
recommendation
,
but
they
want
to
know
where
they
could
join
the
watcher
when
so
disposed
.
<EOS>
rather
than
trust
to
a
verbal
description
of
the
place
,
which
may
mislead
,
Eugene
(
with
a
less
weighty
sense
of
personal
trouble
on
him
than
he
usually
have
)
would
go
out
with
Mr.
Inspector
,
note
the
spot
,
and
come
back
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
shelving
bank
of
the
river

among
the
slimy
stone
of
a
causeway
---
not
the
special
causeway
of
the
six
Jolly
Fellowships
,
which
have
a
landing
-
place
of
its
own
,
but
another
,
a
little
removed
,
and
very
near
to
the
old
windmill
which
be
the
denounced
man

dwelling
-
place
---
be
a

boat
;
some

moor

<EOS>
under
one
of
these
latter
,
Eugene

companion
disappear

<EOS>
and
when
Eugene
have
observe
its
position
with
reference
to
the
other
boat
,
and
have
make
sure
that
he
could
not
miss
it

he
turn
his
eye
upon
the
building
where
,
as
he
have
be
tell
,
the
lonely
girl
with
the
dark
hair
sit
by
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
see
the
light
of
the
fire
shine
through
the
window
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
draw
him
on
to
look
in
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
have
come
out
with
the
express
intention
.
<EOS>
that
part
of
the
bank
have
rank
grass
grow
on
it
,
there
be
no
difficulty
in
get
close
,
without
any
noise
of
footstep
:
it
be
but
to
scramble
up
a
ragged
face
of
pretty
hard
mud
some
three
or
four
foot
high
and
come
upon
the
grass
and
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
He
come
to
the
window
by
that
mean
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
no
other
light
than
the
light
of
the
fire

<EOS>
the
unkindled
lamp
stand
on
the
table

<EOS>
She
sit
on
the
ground
,
look
at
the
brazier
,
with
her
face
lean
on
her
hand
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
kind
of
film
or
flicker
on
her
face
,
which
at
first
he
take
to
be
the
fitful
firelight
;
 
but
,
on
a
second
look
,
he
see
that
she
be
weep
.
<EOS>
a
sad
and
solitary
spectacle
,
as
show
him
by
the
rise
and
the
falling
of
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
little
window
of
but
four
piece
of
glass
,
and
be
not
curtain
;
he
choose
it
because
the
large
window
near
it
be
.
<EOS>
It
show
him
the
room
,
and
the
bill
upon
the
wall
respect
the
drown
people
start
out
and
recede
by
turn
.
<EOS>
but
he
glance
slightly
at
them
,
though
he
look
long
and
steadily
at
her
.
<EOS>
a
deep
rich
piece
of
color
,
with
the
brown
flush
of
her
cheek
and
the
shine
lustre
of
her
hair
,
though
sad
and
solitary
,
weep
by
the
rise
and
the
falling
of
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
She
start
up
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
so
very
still
,
that
he
feel
sure
it
be
not
he
who
have
disturb
her
,
so
merely
withdraw
from
the
window
and
stand
near
it
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
.
<EOS>
She
open
the
door
,
and
say
in
an
alarmed
tone
,
"
Father
,
be
that
you
call
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
again
,
"
Father

once
again

after
listen

I

<EOS>
as
she
re

enter
at

,
he
drop
over
the
bank
and
make
his
way
back
,
among
the
ooze

near
the
hidingplace
,
to
Mortimer
Lightwood
:
to
whom
he

how

He

they

<EOS>
with
this
indication
of
his
depressed
state
of
mind

Eugene
fall
silent
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
all
silent
for
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
as
it
get
to
be
flood
-
tide
,
and
the
water
come
nearer
to
them
,
noise
on
the
river
become
more
frequent
,
and
they
listen
more
.
<EOS>
to
the
turning
of
steam
-
paddle
to
the
clinking
of
iron
chain
,
to
the
creaking
of
block
,
to
the
measure
working
of
oar
,
to
the
occasional
violent
barking
of
some
pass
dog
on
shipboard
,
who
seem
to
scent
them
lie
in
their
hidingplace
.
<EOS>
the
night
be
not
so
dark
but
that
,
besides
the
light
at
bow
and
masthead
glide
to
and
fro
,
they
could
discern
some
shadowy
bulk
attach
;
and
now
and
then
a
ghostly
light
with
a
large
dark
sail
,
like
a
warning
arm
,
would
start
up
very
near
them
,
pass
on
,
and
vanish
.
<EOS>
at
this
time
of
their
watch
,
the
water
close
to
them
would
be
often
agitate
by
some
impulsion
give
it
from
a
distance
.
<EOS>
often
they
believe
this
beat
and
plash
to
be
the
boat
they
lie
in
wait
for
,
run
in
ashore
;
and
again
and
again
they
would
have
start
up
,
but
for
the
immobility
with
which
the
informer
,
well
used
to
the
river
,
keep
quiet
in
his
place
.
  
<EOS>
the
wind
carry
away
the
striking
of
the
great
multitude
of
city
church
clock
,
for
those
lie
to

of
them
;
but
there
be
bell
to
windward
that
tell
them
of
its
be
one

two

---
three

<EOS>
without
that
aid
they
would
have
know
how
the
night
wear
,
by
the
falling
of
the
tide
,
record
in
the
appearance
of
an
ever
-
widen
black
wet
strip
of
shore
,
and
the
emergence
of
the
pave
causeway
from
the
river

foot
by
foot
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
time
so
pass
,
this
slinking
business
become
a
more
and
more
precarious
one
.
<EOS>
It
would
seem
as
if
the
man
have
have
some
intimation
of
what
be
in
hand
against
him
,
or
have
take
fright
?
<EOS>
His
movement
may
have
be
plan
to
gain
for
him
,
in
get
beyond
their
reach
,
twelve
hour

advantage
?
<EOS>
the
honest
man
who
have
expend
the
sweat
of
his
brow
become
uneasy
,
and
begin
to
complain
with
bitterness
of
the
proneness
of
mankind
to
cheat
him
 
---
him
invest
with
the
dignity
of
Labour

<EOS>
Their
retreat
be
so
choose
that

they
could
watch
the
river

they

watch
the

no

I

I
know
how

likewise
that

only

Mr.

to
himself

subside
into
his
regular
series
of
turn
in
the
yard
,
"
if
I
can
make
it
comfortable

my
affair
will
be
go
smooth

<EOS>
the
man
of
low
cunning
have

of

acquire
a

high
simplicity

<EOS>
the
mean

of

,
get
the
well

how
long
such
conquest
last

be
another
matter

that
they
be
achieve
,
be
every

day
experience
,
not
even
to
be
flourish
away
by
Podsnappery
itself
.
<EOS>
the
undesigning
Boffin
have
become
so
far
immeshe
by
the
wily
Wegg
that
his
mind
misgave
him
<EOS>
he
be
a
very
designing
man
indeed
in
purpose
to
do
more
for
Wegg

<EOS>
It
seem
to
him
(
so
skilful
be
Wegg
)
that
he
be
plot
darkly
,
when
he
be
contrive
to
do
the
very
thing
that
Wegg
be
plot
to
get
him
to
do
.
<EOS>
and
thus
,
while
he
be
mentally
turn
the
kind
of
kind
face
on
Wegg
this
morning

he
be
not
absolutely
sure

that
he
may
somehow
deserve
the
charge
of
turn
his
back
on
him
.
  
<EOS>
for
these
reason
Mr.
Boffin
pass
but
anxious
hour
until
evening
come
,
and
with
it
Mr.
Wegg
,
stump
leisurely
to
the
Roman
Empire
.
<EOS>
at
about
this
period
Mr.
Boffin
have
become
profoundly
interested
in
the
fortune
of
a
great
military
leader
know
to
him
as
Bully
Sawyers
,
but
perhaps
better
know
to
fame
and
easy
of
identification
by
the
classical
student
,
under
the
less
britannic
name
of
Belisarius
.
<EOS>
even
this
general
's
career
pale
in
interest
for
Mr.
Boffin
before
the
clearing
of
his
conscience
with
Wegg
;
and
hence
,
when
that
literary
gentleman
have
accord
to
custom
eat
and
drunk
until
he
be
all
a

golw

and
when
he
take
up
his
book
with
the
usual
chirp
introduction

singe
to

when
all
in
a
moment
I
feel
there
be

out

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

ask

"
I

something
else

something
comfortable

put

out

"
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
I
think
of
the
new
house

Miss
Bella

be
think
at
a
great
rate
with
that
sheet
there
in

when
,
all

a
sudden
,
the

as

still

fall

Mr.

up

then
you
run
down

<EOS>
no

I

I
would
try
another

off

<EOS>
I
say
to
myself

`

I
will
go

down

conquer

I
go
in

I
come

get
thick

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
with

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes

I
even
feel
that
they
be
in

dark
behind
the
sidedoor
,

on

little
staircase
,
float
away
into
the
yard

<EOS>
then
,
I
call
you

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.

,
lose
in
amazement

look
at
Mrs.

<EOS>
Mrs.

,
lose
in
her
own
fluttered
inability
to
make
this
out

look
at
Mr.

<EOS>
"
I
think
,
my

"
say
the
Golden
Dustman
,
"
I
will
at
once
get
rid
of
Wegg
for
the
night

it
may
be
put
into

somebody
else

he
hear
this
<EOS>

it
get
about

"
I
never

Mrs.

I
have
be
about

I
have
be
in

Murder
be

I
never
have
a

say
Mr.

depend
upon
it

it
come

dwell
on
that
dark
spot

"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
but
why
do
not
it
come
before
?
"
ask
Mrs.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
this
draft
on
Mr.
Boffin
's
philosophy
could
only
be
meet
by
that
gentleman
with
the
remark
that
everything
that
be
at
all
,
must
begin
at
some
time
.
<EOS>
then
,
tuck
his
wife
's
arm
under
his
own
,
that
she
may
not
be
leave
by
herself
to
be
trouble
again

he
descend
to
release
Wegg

<EOS>
who
,
be
something
drowsy
after
his
plentiful
repast
,
and
constitutionally
of
a
shirking
temperament
,
be
well
enough
pleased
to
stump
away
,
without
do
what
he
have
come
to
do
,
and
be
pay
for
do
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
then
put
on
his
hat
,
and
Mrs.
Boffin
her
shawl
;
and
the
pair
,
further
provide
with
a
bunch
of
key
and
a
light
lantern

go
all
over
the
dismal

dismal
everywhere

<EOS>
not

they
pursue
them
into

and
set
the
lantern

when
all
be

at

of
one
of

they
comfortably
trot

open

again

her

face
across
the
table

she
lean
forward
to
give
it
a
pat

MINDERS
and
RE
-
MINDERS

<EOS>
the
Secretary
lose
no
time
in
get
to
work
,
and
his
vigilance
and
method
soon
set
their
mark
on
the
Golden
Dustman
's
affair
.
<EOS>
His
carnestness
in
determine
to
understand
the
length
and
breadth
and
depth
of
every
piece
of
work
submit
to
him
by
his
employer
,
be
as
special
as
his
despatch
in
transact
it
.
<EOS>
He
accept
no
information
or
explanation
at
second
hand
,
but
make
himself
the
master
of
everything
confide
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
one
part
of
the
Secretary
's
conduct
,
underlie
all
the
rest
,
may
have
be
mistrust
by
a
man
with
a
well
knowledge
of
man
than
the
Golden
Dustman
have
.
<EOS>
the
Secretary
be
as
far
from
be
inquisitive
or
intrusive
as
Secretary
could
be
,
but
nothing
less
than
a
complete
understanding
of
the
whole
of
the
affair
would
content
him
.
<EOS>
It
soon
become
apparent
(
from
the
knowledge
with
which
he
set
out
)
that
he
must
have
be
to
the
office
where
the
Harmon
will
be
register
,
and
must
have
read
the
will
.
<EOS>
He
anticipate
Mr.
Boffin
's
consideration
whether
he
should
be
advise
with
on
this
or
that
topic
,
by
show
that
he
already
know
of
it
and
understand
it
.
<EOS>
He
do
this
with
no
attempt
at
concealment
,
seem
to
be
satisfied
that
it
be
part
of
his
duty
to
have
prepare
himself
at
all
attainable
point
for
its
utmost
discharge
.
  
<EOS>
this
may
---
let
it
be
repeat
---
have
awaken
some
little
vague
mistrust
in
a
man
more
worldly
-
wise
than
the
golden
Dustman
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
the
Secretary
be
discern
,
discreet
,
and
silent
,
though
as
zealous
as
if
the
affair
have
be
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
show
no
love
of
patronage
or
the
command
of
money
,
but
distinctly
prefer
resign
both
to
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
if
,
in
his
limited
sphere
,
he
seek
power
,
it
be
the
power
of
knowledge
;
the
power
derivable
from
a
perfect
comprehension
of
his
business
.
  
<EOS>
as
on
the
Secretary
's
face
there
be
a
nameless
cloud
,
so
on
his
manner
there
be
a
shadow
equally
indefinable
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that

be
embarrassed

as
on
that
first
night
with
the
Wilfer
family

habitually
unembarrassed
now

and
yet
the
something
remain
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
his
manner
be
bad
,
as
on
that
occasion
;
 
it
be
now
very
good
,
as
be
modest
,
gracious
,
and
ready
.
<EOS>
yet
the
something
never
leave
it
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
write
of
man
who
have
undergo
a
cruel
captivity
,
or
who
have
pass
through
a
terrible
strait
,

who
in
self

preservation
have
kill
a
defenceless
fellow

creature
,
that
the
record
thereof
have
never
fade
from
their
countenance
until
they
die

<EOS>
be
there
any
such
record
here
?
  
<EOS>
He
establish
a
temporary
office
for
himself
in
the
new
house
,
and
all
go
well
under
his
hand
,
with
one
singular
exception
.
<EOS>
He
manifestly
object
to
communicate
with
Mr.
Boffin
's
solicitor
.
<EOS>
two
or
three
time
,
when
there
be
some
slight
occasion
for
his
do
so
,
he
transfer
the
task
to
Mr.
Boffin
;
and
his
evasion
of
it
soon
become
so
curiously
apparent
,
that
Mr.
Boffin
speak
to
him
on
the
subject
of
his
reluctance
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
so
,
"
the
Secretary
admit
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
not

from

answer

be

of
course
if
you
press
it
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
I
be
ready
to
comply

<EOS>
but
I
should
take
it
as
a
great
favour
if
you
would
not
press
it
without
urgent
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
now
,
it
could
not
be
say
that
there
be
urgent
occasion
,
for
Lightwood
retain
no
other
affair
in
his
hand
than
such
as
still
linger
and
languish
about
the
undiscovered
criminal
,
and
such
as
arise
out
of
the
purchase
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
many
other
matter
that
may
have
travel
to
him
,
now
stop
short
at
the
Secretary
,
under
whose
administration
they
be
far
more
expeditiously
and
satisfactorily
disposed
of
than
they
would
have
be
if
they
have
get
into
Young
Blight
's
domain
.
<EOS>
this
the
golden
Dustman
quite
understand
.
<EOS>
even
the
matter
immediately
in
hand
be
of
very
little
moment
as
require
personal
appearance
on
the
Secretary
's
part
,
for
it
amount
to
no
more
than
this
:
---
<EOS>
the
death
of
Hexam
render
the
sweat
of
the
honest
man
's
brow
unprofitable
,
the
honest
man
have
shufflingly
decline
to
moisten
his
brow
for
nothing
,
with
that
severe
exertion
which
be
know
in
legal
circle
as
swear
your
way
through
a
stone
wall
.
<EOS>
consequently
,
that
new
light
have
go
sputtering
out
.
<EOS>
but
,
the
airing
of
the
old
fact
have
lead
some
one
concern
to
suggest
that
it
would
be
well
before
they
be
reconsigne
to
their
gloomy
shelf
---
now
probably
for
ever
---
to
induce
or
compel
that

<EOS>
and
all

<EOS>
among

first
occupation

Mrs.

a
conspicuous
place

<EOS>
from
the
early
moment
of

<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Milvey
have
find
their
search
a
diffcult
one
.
<EOS>
either
an
eligible
orphan
be
of
the
wrong
sex
(
which
almost
always
happen
)
or
be
too
old
,
or
too
young

sickly

or
too
dirty
,
or
too
much
accustomed
to

too
likely
to
run
away
;
or
,
it
be
find
impossible
to
complete
the
philanthropic
transaction
without

<EOS>
for
,
the
instant
it
become
known
that
anybody
want
the
orphan
,
up
start
some
affectionate
relative
of
the
orphan
who
put
a
price
upon
the
orphan
's
head
.
<EOS>
the
suddenness
of
an
orphan
's
rise
in
the
market
be
not
to
be
parallel
by
the
maddest
record
of
the
Stock
Exchange
.
<EOS>
He

.
<EOS>
It
be
announce

by
emissary

for
the
purpose
,
that
Mr.

Mrs.

be
come
down

,
orphan

would
be
instantly

likewise

occasion
,
by
orphan
-
holder
keep
back
,
and
then
rush
into
the
market
a
dozen
together
.
<EOS>
but
,
the
uniform
principle
at
the
root
of
all
these
various
operation
be
bargain
and
sale
;
and
that
principle
could
not
be
recognize
by
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Milvey
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
,
tiding
be
receive
by
the
Reverend
Frank
of
a
charming
orphan
to
be
find
at
Brentford
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
deceased
parent
(
late
his
parishioner
)
have
a
poor
widow
grandmother
in
that
agreeable
town
,
and
she
,
Mrs.
Betty
Higden
,
have
carry
off
the
orphan
with
maternal
care
,
but
could
not
afford
to
keep
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
Secretary
propose
to
Mrs.
Boffin
,
either
to
go
down
himself
and
take
a
preliminary
survey
of
this
orphan
,
or
to
drive
her
down
,
that
she
may
at
once
form
her
own
opinion
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
prefer
the
latter
course
,
they
set
off
one
morning
in
a
hire
phaeton
,
convey
the
hammer
-
head
young
man
behind
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
abode
of
Mrs.
Betty
Higden
be
not
easy
to
find
,
lie
in
such
complicated
back
settlement
of
muddy
Brentford
that
they
leave
their
equipage
at
the
sign
of
the
Three
Magpies
,
and
go
in
search
of
it
on
foot
.
<EOS>
after
many
inquiry
and
defeat
,
there
be
point
out
to
them
in
a
lane
,
a
very
small
cottage
residence
,
with
a
board
across
the
open
doorway
,
hook
on
to
which
board
by
the
armpit
be
a
young
gentleman
of
tender
year
,
angle
for
mud
with
a
headless
wooden
horse
and
line
.
<EOS>
in
this
young
sportsman
,
distinguish
by
a
crisply
curl
auburn
head
and
a
bluff
countenance
,
the
Secretary
descry
the
orphan
.
  
<EOS>
It
unfortunately
happen
as
they
quicken
their
pace
,
that
the
orphan
,
lose
to
consideration
of
personal
safety
in
the
ardour
of
the
moment
,
overbalance
himself
and
topple
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
be
an
orphan
of
a
chubby
conformation
,
he
then
take
to
rolling
,
and
have
roll
into
the
gutter
before
they
could
come
up
.
<EOS>
from
the
gutter
he
be
rescue
by
John
Rokesmith
,
and
thus
the
first
meeting
with
Mrs.
Higden
be
inaugurate
by
the
awkward
circumstance
of
their
being
in
possession
---
one
would
say
at
first
sight
unlawful
possession
---
of
the
orphan
,
upside
down
and
purple
in
the
countenance
.
<EOS>
the
board
across
the
doorway
too
,
act
as
a
trap
equally
for
the
foot
of
Mrs.
Higden
come
out
,
and
the
foot
of
Mrs.
Boffin
and
John
Rokesmith
go
in
,
greatly
increase
the
difficulty
of
the
situation
:
to
which
the
cry
of
the
orphan
impart
a
lugubrious
and
inhuman
character
.
  
<EOS>
at
first
,
it
be
impossible
to
explain
,
on
account
of
the
orphan
's
"
hold
his
breath
:
"
a
most
terrific
proceeding
,
superinduce
in
the
orphan
,
lead
-
colour
rigidity
and
a
deadly
silence
,
compare
with
which
his
cry
be
music
yield
the
height
of
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
but
as
he
gradually
recover
,
Mrs.
Boffin
gradually
introduce
herself
,
and
smile
peace
be
gradually
woo
back
to
Mrs.
Betty
Higden
's
home
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
then
perceive
to
be
a
small
home
with
a
large
mangle
in
it
,
at
the
handle
of
which
machine
stand
a
very
long
boy
,
with
a
very
little
head
,
and
an
open
mouth
of
disproportionate
capacity
that
seem
to
assist
his
eye
in
stare
at
the
visitor
.
<EOS>
in
a
corner
below
the
mangle
,
on
a
couple
of
stool
,
sit
two
very
little
child
:
a
boy
and
a
girl
;
and
when
the
very
long
boy
,
in
an
interval
of
staring
,
take
a
turn
at
the
mangle
,
it
be
alarming
to
see
how
it
lunge
itself
at
those
two
innocent
,
like
a
catapult
design
for
their
destruction
,
harmlessly
retire
when
within
an
inch
of
their
head
.
<EOS>
the
room
be
clean
and
neat
.
<EOS>
It
have
a
brick
floor

and
a
window
of

the
window
on
which
scarletbean

the
Fates

<EOS>
however
propitious
they
may
have
be
in
the
season
that
be
go
,
to
Betty
Higden
in
the
matter
of
bean
,
they
have
not
be
very
favourable
in
the
matter
of
coin
;
for
it
be
easy
to
see
that
she
be
poor
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
one
of
those
old
woman
,
be
Mrs.
Betty
Higden
,
who
by
dint
of
an
indomitable
purpose
and
a
strong
constitution

out
many
year
,
though
each
year
have
come
with
its
new
knock
-
down
blow
fresh
to
the
fight
against
her
,
weary
by
it
;
an
active
old
woman
,
with
a
bright
dark
eye
and
a
resolute
face
,
yet
quite
a
tender
creature
too
;
not
a
logically

reason
woman
,
but
God
be
good
,
and
heart
may
count
in
Heaven
as
high
as

<EOS>
"
yes

say
she
,
when
the
business
be
open
,
"
Mrs.
Milvey

the
kindness
to

I
get
Sloppy
to

<EOS>
It
be
a
pretty
letter

<EOS>
but
she
be
an
affable
lady

"
  
<EOS>
the
visitor
glance
at
the
long
boy
,
who
seem
to
indicate
by
a
broad
stare
of
his
mouth
and
eye
that
in
him
Sloppy
stand
confess

<EOS>
"
for

Betty

"
  
<EOS>
the
visitor
again
consider
it
a
point
of
politeness
to
look
at
Sloppy
,
who
,
look
at
them
,
suddenly
throw
back
his
head
,
extend
his
mouth
to
its
utmost
width
,
and
laugh
loud
and
long
.
<EOS>
at
this
the
two
innocent
,
with
their
brain
in
that
apparent
danger
,
laugh
,
and
Mrs.
Higden
laugh
,
and
the
orphan
laugh
,
and
then
the
visitor
laugh
.
<EOS>
which
be
more
cheerful
than
intelligible
.
  
<EOS>
then
Sloppy
seem
to
be
seize
with
an
industrious
mania
or
fury
,
turn
to
at
the
mangle
,
and
impel
it
at
the
head
of
the
innocent
with
such
a
creaking
and
rumbling
,
that
Mrs.

stop
him

without
and
before

be
a
miserable
loft
in
an
unsavoury
yard
.
<EOS>
Its
atmosphere
be
oppressive
and
disagreeable
;
 
it
be
crowd
,
noisy
,
and
confusing
;
half
the
pupil
drop
asleep
,
or
fall
into
a
state
of

stupefaction

the
other
half

noise

they

out

<EOS>
the

have
no
idea
of
execution

and
a
lamentable
jumble
be
the
upshot
of
their
kind
endeavour
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
school
for
all

and
for

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
but
,
all
the
place
be
pervade
by
a
grimly
ludicrous
pretence
that
every
pupil
be
childish
and
innocent

<EOS>
this
pretence

much

lead

the
ghastliest
absurdity

<EOS>
young

themselves
enthral

the
Adventures
of
Little
Margery

who
reside

mill
;
severely
reprove
and
morally
squash
the
miller
,
when
she
be
five
and
he
be
fifty
;
divide
her
porridge
with
singing
bird
;
deny
herself
a
new
nankeen

on
the
ground
that
the
turnip

not
wear
nankeen
bonnet
,
neither

them

who
plait
straw
and

the
dreary
oration
to
all
comer

at

unseasonable

<EOS>
so
,
unwieldy
young

<EOS>
several

it

boastful

that
you

not

but
because
you

<EOS>
contrariwise
,
the
adult
pupil
be
teach
to
read
(
if
they
could
learn

out
of
the
New
Testament
;
and
by
dint
of
stumble
over
the
syllable
and
keep
their
bewilder
eye
on
the
particular
syllable
come
round
to
their
turn

absolutely
ignorant

the
sublime

<EOS>
an
exceedingly

jumble

black

red
spirit

white

jumbled
jumbled
jumble
jumbled

jumble
every
night

<EOS>
and
particularly
every
Sunday
night
.
<EOS>
for
then
,
an
inclined
plane
of
unfortunate
infant
would
be
hand
over
to
the
prosiest
and
bad
of
all
the
teacher
with
good
intention
,
whom
nobody
old
would
endure
.
<EOS>
who
,
take
his
stand
on
the
floor
before
them
as
chief
executioner

would
be
attend
by
a
conventional
volunteer
boy
as
executioner
's
assistant

<EOS>
when
and
where
it
first
become
the
conventional
system
that
a
weary
or
inattentive
infant
in
a
class
must
have
its
face
smooth
downward
with
a
hot
hand
,
or
when
and
where
the
conventional
volunteer
boy
first
beheld
such
system
in
operation
,
and
become
inflamed
with
a
sacred
zeal
to
administer
it
,
matter
not
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
function
of
the
chief
executioner
to
hold
forth
,
and
it
be
the
function
of
the
acolyte
to
dart
at
sleep
infant
,
yawn
infant
,
restless
infant
,
whimper
infant
,
and
smooth
their
wretched
face
;
sometimes
with
one
hand
,
as

he
be
anoint
them
for
a
whisker
;
sometimes
with
both
hand
,
apply
after
the
fashion
of
blinker

<EOS>
and
so
the
jumble
would
be
in
action
in
this
department
for
a
mortal
hour

the
exponent

to
My

let
us
say
,
for
example
,
about
the
beautiful
come
to
the
Sepulchre

and
repeat
the
word
Sepulchre
(
commonly
use
among
infant
)
five
hundred
time
,
and
never
once
hint
what
it
mean
;
the
conventional
boy
smooth
away
right
and
leave
,
as
an
infallible
commentary
;
the
whole
hot
-
bed
of
flushed
and
exhausted
infant
exchange
measle
,
rash
,
whooping
-
cough
,
fever
,
and
stomach
disorder

as

<EOS>
even
in
this
temple
of
good
intention

an
exceptionally
sharp
boy
exceptionally
determined
to
learn
,
could
learn
something
,
and
,
have
learn
it
,
could
impart
it
much
well
than
the
teacher
;
 
as
be
more
knowing
than
they

and
not
at
the
disadvantage
in
which
they
stand
towards
the
shrewd
pupil

<EOS>
in
this
way
it
have
come
about
that
Charley

rise
in

jumble

the

with
a
struggle

<EOS>
the
boy
,
with
a
return
of
that
former
reluctance

struggle

whatever
it

seem
to
debate
with
himself

<EOS>
at
length
he
say
,
raise
his
eye
to

His

there

combine

there

he

They

It
come
out
in
Miss
Peecher
the
schoolmistress
,
water
the
flower
in
the
little
dusty
bit
of
garden
attach
to
her
small
official
residence
,
with
little
window
like
the
eye
in
needle
,
and
little
door
like
the
cover
of
school
book
.
  
<EOS>
Small
,
shine
,
neat
,
methodical
,
and
buxom
be
Miss
Peecher
cherry

cheek
and
tuneful
of
voice

<EOS>
a
little
pincushion
,
a
little
housewife
,
a
little
book
,
a
little
workbox
,
a
little
set
of
table
and
weight
and
measure
,
and
a
little
woman
,
all
in
one
.
<EOS>
She
could
write
a
little
essay
on
any
subject
,
exactly
a
slate
long
,
begin
at
the
left
-
hand
top
of
one
side
and
end
at
the
right
-
hand
bottom
of
the
other

and
the
essay
should
be
strictly
accord
to
rule
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Bradley
Headstone
have
address
a
write
proposal
of
marriage
to
her
,
she
would
probably
have
reply
in
a
complete
little
essay
on
the
theme
exactly
a
slate
long
,
but
would
certainly
have
reply
yes
.
<EOS>
for
she
love
him
.
<EOS>
the
decent
hair

guard
that
go
round
his
neck
and
take
care
of
his
decent
silver
watch
be
an
object
of
envy
to
her
.
<EOS>
so
would
miss
Peecher
have
go
round
his
neck
and
take
care
of
him
.
<EOS>
of
him
,
insensible
.
<EOS>
because
he
do
not
love
Miss

sufficiently

my
leg
so
queer
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
look
at
the
little
creature
with
a
wonder
that
do
not
diminish
,
and
the
schoolmaster
say
:
"
I
be
sorry
<EOS>
your
fine
lady
be
so
inconsiderate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
way
with
them
,
"
say
the
person
of
the
house
,
shrug
her
shoulder
again
.
<EOS>
"
and
they
take
no
care
of
their
clothe
,
and
they
never
keep
to
the
same
fashion
a
month
.
<EOS>
I
work
for
a
doll
with
three
daughter
.
<EOS>
bless
you
,
she
be
enough
to
ruin
her
husband
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
person
of
the
house
give
a
weird
little
laugh
here
,
and
give
them
another
look
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
.
<EOS>
She
have
an
elfin
chin
that
be
capable
of
great
expression
;
and
whenever
she
give
this
look
,
she
hitch
this
chin
up
.
<EOS>
as
if
her
eye
and
her
chin
work
together
on
the
same
wire
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
always
as
busy
as
you

now

<EOS>
"
busy

slack
just
now

a
large
mourning
order
the
day
before

Doll
I

for

a
canary

bird

"
 
<EOS>
the
person
of
the
house
give
another
little
laugh
,
and
then
nod
her
head
several
time
,
as
who
should
moralize
,
"
oh
this
world
,
this
world
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
alone
all
day

"
ask
Bradley

"

cry
the

with
a
little
scream

I
can
not

<EOS>
She
say
this
with
an
angry
little
shake
of
her
right
fist
close
before
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
it
scarcely
require
the
teacher
-
habit
,
to
perceive
that
the
doll
's
dressmaker
be
incline
to
be
bitter
on
the
difference
between
herself
and
other
child

<EOS>
but
both
master
and
pupil
understand
it
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
always
run
about
and
screech
,
always
play
and
fighting

always
skip

skip

skipping
on

chalk
it

the
little

that
be
not
all

often

back

I
will
tell
you
what
I

to
punish
'em

there

door
under
the
church
in
the
Square

black
door
,
lead
into
black
vault

<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
I
would
open
one
of
those
door

I
would
cram
'em
all
in
,
<EOS>
and
then
I
would
lock
the
door

through

keyhole
I
would
blow
in
pepper

<EOS>

what
would
be
the
good
of
blow
in
pepper

ask
Charley

set
'em
sneeze

the
person

the
house
,
"
and
make
their
eye
water
.
<EOS>
and
when
they
be
all
sneeze
and
inflame
,
I
would
mock
'em
through
the
keyhole
.
<EOS>
just
as
they
,
with
their
trick

their
manner
,
mock
a
person
through
a
person
's
keyhole

<EOS>
an
uncommonly
emphatic
shake
of
her
little
fist
close
before
her
eye
,
seem
to
ease
the
mind
of
the
person
of
the
house
;
for
she
add
with
recover
composure
,
"
no

no

no

<EOS>
no
child

me
.
<EOS>

me
grow
-
up

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
difficult
to
guess
the
age
of
this
strange
creature
,
for
her
poor
figure
furnish
no
clue
to
it
,
and
her
face
be
at
once
so
young
and
so
old
.
<EOS>
twelve
,
or
at
the
most
thirteen

may
be
near
the
mark

so
sensible

sit
so
quiet

do
not

caper
about

I

grown

up

I
marry

I
suppose
I
must
make
up
my
mind

one
of

<EOS>
She
listen
to
a
step
outside
that
catch
her
ear
,
and
there
be
a
soft
knock
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
pull
at
a
handle
within
her
reach
,
she
say
,
with
a
pleased
laugh
:

You

him
to

Her
eye
meet
those
of
the
schoolmaster
,
who
have
evidently
expect
to
see
a
very
different
sort
of
person
,
and
a
murmur
word
or
two
of
salutation
pass
between
them
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
little
flurry
by
the
unexpected
visit
,

the
schoolmaster
be
not
at
his
ease

he
never

thin

"
I
do

visit
from

his

shake
her
head
again

with
a
quiet
smile

the
use

room

the
person

the
house

screw
up
one
of

little
bony
fist

like
an
opera

glass

look
through
it

with
her
eye

her
chin
in
that
quaint
accordance

always
this
room

visitor

have
not
you

Lizzie
dear

"
  
It
happen
that
Bradley
Headstone
notice
a
very
slight
action
of
Lizzie
Hexam
's
hand
,
as
though
it
check
the
doll
's
dressmaker

<EOS>
and
it
happen
that
the
latter
notice
him
in
the
same
instant
;
 
for
she
make
a
double
eyeglass
of
her
two
hand

look
at
him
through
it
,

cry
,
with
a
waggish
shake
of
her
head

aha

catch
you
spy
,
do
I

<EOS>
It
may
have
fall
out
so
,
any
way

Bradley
Headstone
also
notice
that
immediately
after
this
,
Lizzie
,
who
have
not
take
off
her
bonnet
,
rather
hurriedly
propose
that
as
the
room
be
get
dark
they
should
go
out
into
the
air

<EOS>
They
go
out
;
the
visitor
say
good
-
night
to
the
doll
's
dressmaker
,
whom
they
leave
,
lean
back
in
her
chair
with
her
arm
cross

singe
to
herself
in
a
sweet
thoughtful
little
voice

I
will
saunter
on

the
river

Bradley

<EOS>
"
You
will
be
glad

talk
together

<EOS>
as
his
uneasy
figure
go
on
before
them
among
the
evening
shadow

to
his

petulantly
:

with

within

by
this

close
to
Vauxhall
Bridge

they
resolve

in
consequence

to
take
that
way
over
the
Thames

they
leave
her
:
<EOS>
Bradley

give
her
his
hand
at
parting

him
for
his

the
master

the
pupil
walk
on

rapidly

silently

They
have
nearly
cross
the
bridge

when
a
gentleman
come
coolly
saunter
towards
them
,
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
,
his
coat
throw
back
,

his
hand
behind
him

something
in

in

certain
lazily
arrogant
air
with
which
he
approach

hold
possession

twice

much
pavement

as
the

pass

look
at
him
narrowly

still

look
after
him

It

Bradley

the

I

your
pardon

here

<EOS>
though
he
say
it
as
if
his
wonder
be
past

at
the

time
resume
the
walk

it
be
not
lose
upon
the
master
that
he
look
over
his

after
speak

perplexed

heavy
on

again

why
?

for
nothing

---
it

the

about

not
happen

do
now

have
so
lose

as
they
walk
on
side

without
attempt

then
he
nod
and
answer
,

yes

go
to
see
her

quickly

well
enough

should
like
to
catch
him
at
it

<EOS>
when
they
have
walk
on
for
a
time
,
more
rapidly
than
before

,
clasp
the
pupil

about

Bradley

gradually
release
the
boy
's
arm

as
if
he
be
thoughtful
,

they
walk
on
side
by
side
as
before

<EOS>
after
a
long
silence
between
them
,
Bradley
resume
the
talk

"
I
suppose

your

with
a
curious
break
both
before

after

receive
hardly
any

"
hardly
any

no

to
her

objection

I
remember
them
in

yet
---
your
sister

scarcely
look
or
speak
like
an
ignorant
person

"
  
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
have
as
much
thought
as
the
good
,
Mr.
Headstone
.
<EOS>
too
much
,
perhaps
,
without
teach
.
<EOS>
I
use
to
call
the
fire
at
home
,
her
book
,
for
she
be
always
full
of
fancy
---
sometimes
quite
wise
fancy
,
consider
---
when
she
sit
look
at
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
that
,
"
say
Bradley
Headstone
.
  
<EOS>
His
pupil
be
a
little
surprised
by
this
striking
in
with
so
sudden
and
decide
and
emotional
an
objection
,
but
take
it
as
a
proof
of
the
master
's
interest
in
himself
.
<EOS>
It
embolden
him
to
say
:
  
"
I
have
never
bring
myself
to
mention
it
openly
to
you
,
Mr.
Headstone
,
and
you
be
my
witness
that
I
could
not
even
make
up
my
mind
to
take
it
from
you
before
we
come
out
to
-
night
;
but
it
be
a
painful
thing
to
think
that
if
I
get
on
as
well
as
you
hope
,
I
shall
be
---
I
will
not
say
disgrace
,
because
I
do
not
mean
disgrace
---
<EOS>
but
---
  
rather
put
to
the
blush
if
it
be
know
---
by
a
sister
who
have
be
very
good
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Bradley
Headstone
in
a
slurring
way
,
for
his
mind
scarcely
seem
to
touch
that
point
,
so
smoothly
do
it
glide
to
another
,
"
and
<EOS>
there
be
this
possibility
to
consider
.
<EOS>
some
man
who
have
work
his
way
may
come
to
admire
---
your
sister
---
and
may
even
in
time
bring
himself
to
think
of
marrying
---
your
sister
---
 
<EOS>
and
it
would
be
a
sad
drawback
and
a
heavy
penalty
upon
him
,
if
,
overcome
in
his
mind
<EOS>
other
inequality
of
condition
and
other
consideration
against
it
,
this
inequality
and
this
consideration
remain
in
full
force
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
much
my
own
meaning
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
,
"
say
Bradley
Headstone
,
"
but
you
speak
of
a
mere
brother
.
<EOS>
now
,
the
case
I
have
suppose
would
be
a
much
strong
case
;
because
an
admirer
,
a
husband
,
would
form
the
connexion
voluntarily
,
besides
be
oblige
to
proclaim
it
:
which
a
brother
be
not
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
you
know
,
it
must
be
say
of
you
that
you
could
not
help
yourself
:
while
it
would
be
say
of
him
,
with
equal
reason
,
that
he
could
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
,
sir
.
<EOS>
sometimes
since
Lizzie
be
leave
free
by
father
's
death
,
I
have
think
that
such
a
young
woman
may
soon
acquire
more
than
enough
to
pass
muster
.
<EOS>
and
sometimes
I
have
even
think
that
perhaps
Miss
Peecher
---
"
  
"
for
the
purpose
,
I
would
advise
not
Miss
Peecher
,
"
Bradley
Headstone
strike
in
with
a
recurrence
of
his
late
decision
of
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
think
of
it
for
me
,
Mr.
Headstone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Hexam
,
yes
.
<EOS>
I
will
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
think
maturely
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
think
well
of
it
.

walk

many

rather
so
few

contemptible
shilling

come
here

certain
night
in

give
you
certain
instruction
which
you
would
not
want
if
you
have
not

deny
daughter

You
know
that
it
be
good
to
have
it

you
would
never

so
devote
yourself

have
it

<EOS>
then
why
not
have
it
:
especially
when

profit
by

down

there

musingly

I
dare

my

sing
better

my

better

for

I

tone

the
child

I

early

They
be
not

beat

they
be
never
in

They
be
not

never
make
me
tremble
all
over
,
by
set
up
shrill
noise
,

they
never
mock
me
.
<EOS>
such
number
of
them
too

<EOS>
all
in
white
dress

with
something
shine
on

on

never

imitate
with

I
know
it
so
well

They
use
to
come
down
in

they
sweep
about

up

it

It

<EOS>
It
be
clearly

that
nobody

up

five
thousand

<EOS>
the

,
in

not

"
but
have
you
make
up
your

to
take
this

"
You

why

he

regard

You

<EOS>
veneer
immediately
mention
what
a
blessing
he
feel
it
,
to
possess
a
friend
capable
of
such
grand
administrative

really

this

leave

he

who
enthusiastically
rally
round
him
by
at
once
bolt
off
in
cabs

take

<EOS>
then
veneer
repair
to
the

in

with
him
transact
some
delicate
affair

Mrs.

<EOS>
no

to

how

how
that
it

the
time
for

how
that

as

to
entreat
Lady

;
how
that
the

will
return

on

,
until

<EOS>
"
My

say
Lady

,
"
compose
yourself
;
we
will
bring
him
in
.
"
<EOS>
and
Lady
Tippins
really
do
work
,
and
work
the
veneer
horse
too
;
for
she
clatter
about
town
all
day
,
call
upon
everybody
she
know
,
and
show
her
entertaining
power
and
green
fan
to
immense
advantage
,
by
rattle
on
with
,
<EOS>
My
dear
soul
,
what
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
what
do
you
suppose
me
to
be
?
<EOS>
You
will
never
guess
.
<EOS>
I
be
pretend
to
be
an
electioneer
agent
.
<EOS>
and
for
what
place
?
<EOS>
Poce
of
all
Pocket
-
Breaches
.
<EOS>
and
why
?
<EOS>
because
the
dear
friend
I
have
in
the
world
have
buy
it
.
<EOS>
and
who
be
the
dear
friend
I
have
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
a
man
of
the
name
of
veneering
.
<EOS>
not
omit
his
wife
,
who
be
the
other
dear
friend
I
have
in
the
world
;
and
I
positively
declare
I
forget
their
baby
,
<EOS>
who
be
the
other
.
<EOS>
and
we
be
carry
on
this
little
farce
to
keep
up
appearance
,
and
be
not
it
refreshing
!
<EOS>
then
,
my
precious
child
,
the
fun
of
it
be
that
nobody
know
who
these
veneering
be
,
and
that
they
know
nobody
,
and
that
they
have
a
house
out
of
the
Tales
of
the
Genii
,
and
give
dinner
out
of
the
Arabian
Nights
.
<EOS>
curious
to
see
'em
,
my

<EOS>
say
you
will
know
'em

<EOS>
come

with
'em
.
<EOS>
They
shall
not
bore
you
.
<EOS>
say
who
shall
meet
you
.
<EOS>
We
will
make
up
a
party
of
our
own
,
and
I
will
engage
that
they
shall
not
interfere
with
you
for
one
single
moment
.
<EOS>
You
really
ought
to
see
their
gold
and
silver
camel
.
<EOS>
I
call
their
dinner
-
table
,
the
Caravan
.
<EOS>
do
come
and
dine
with
my
veneering
,
my
own
veneering
,
my
exclusive
property
,
the
dear
friend
I
have
in

<EOS>
and
above
all
,
my
dear
,
be
sure
you
promise
me
your
vote
and
interest
and
all
sort
of
plumper
for
Pocket
-
Breaches
:
for
we
could
not
think
of
spend
sixpence
on
it
,
my
love
,
and
can
only
consent
to
be
bring
in
by
the
spontaneous
thingummy
of
the
incorruptible
whatdoyoucallum
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
the
point
of
view
seize
by
the
bewitching
Tippins
,
that
this
same
working
and
rally
round
be
to
keep
up
appearance
,
may
have
something
in
it
,
but
not
all
the
truth
.
<EOS>
More
be
do
,
or
consider
to
be
do
---
which
do
as
well
---
by
take
cab
,
and
"
go
about
,
"
than
the
fair
tippin
know
of
.
<EOS>
many
vast
vague
reputation
have
be
make
,
solely
by
take
cab
and
go
about
.
<EOS>
this
particularly
obtain
in
all
parliamentary
affair
.
<EOS>
whether
the
business
in
hand
be
to
get
a
man
in
,
or
get
a
man
out
,
or
get
a
man
over
,
or
promote
a
railway
,
or
jockey
a
railway
,
or
what
else
,
nothing
be
understand
to
be
so
effectual
as
scour
nowhere
in
a
violent
hurry
---
in
short
,
as
take
cab
and
go
about
.
  
<EOS>
probably
because
this
reason
be
in
the
air
,
Twemlow
,
far
from
be
singular
in
his
persuasion
that
he
work
like
a
Trojan
,
be
cap
by
Podsnap
,
who
in
his
turn
be
cap
by
boot
and
Brewer
.
<EOS>
at
eight
o'clock
,
when
all
these
hard
worker
assemble
to
dine
at
Veneering
's
,
it
be
understand
that
the
cab
of
Boots
and
Brewer
must
not
leave
the
door
,
but
that
pail
of
water
must
be
bring
from
the
near
baiting
-
place
,
and
cast
over
the
horse
'
leg
on
the
very
spot
,
lest
boot
and
Brewer
should
have
instant
occasion
to
mount
and
away
.
<EOS>
those
fleet
messenger
require
the
Analytical
to
see
that
their
hat
be
deposit
where
they
can
be
lay
hold
of
at
an
instant
's
notice
;
and
they
dine
(
remarkably
well
though
)
with
the
air
of
fireman
in
charge
of
an
engine
,
expect
intelligence
of
some
tremendous
conflagration
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
veneer
faintly
remark
,
as
dinner
open
,
that
many
such
day
would
be
too
much
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
many
such
day
would
be
too
much
for
all
of
us
,
"
say
Podsnap
;
 
"
but
we
will
bring
him
in
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
bring
him
in
,
"
say
Lady
Tippins
,
sportively
wave
her
green
fan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
veneer
for
ever
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
bring
him
in
!
"
say
Twemlow
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
bring
him
in
!
"
<EOS>
say
Boots
and
Brewer
.
  
<EOS>
strictly
speak
,
it
would
be
hard
to
show
cause
why
they
should
not
bring
him
in
<EOS>
,
Pocket
-
breach
have
close
its
little
bargain
,
and
there
be
no
opposition
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
agree
that
they
must
"
work
"
 
to
the
last
,
and
that
if
they
do
not
work
,
something
indefinite
would
happen
.
<EOS>
It
be
likewise
agree
that
they
be
all
so
exhausted
with
the
work
behind
them
,
and
need
to
be
so
fortify
for
the
work
before
them
,
as
to
require
peculiar
strengthen
from
Veneering
's
cellar
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
the
Analytical
have
order
to
produce
the
cream
of
the
cream
of
his
binns
,
and
therefore
it
fall
out
that
rallying
become
rather
a
try
word
for
the
occasion
;
Lady
Tippins
be
observe
gamely
to
inculcate
the
necessity
of
rear
round
their
dear
veneering
;
<EOS>
podsnap
advocate
roar
round
him
;
Boots
and
Brewer
declare
their
intention
of
reel
round
him
;
boot
and
veneer
thank
his
devoted
friend
one
and
all
,
with
great
emotion
,
for
rarullarulle
round
him
.
  
<EOS>
in
these
inspiring
moment
,
brewer
strike
out
an
idea
which
be
the
great
hit
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
He
consult
his
watch
,
and
say
(
like
Guy
Fawkes
)
,
he
will
now
go
down
to
the
House
of
Commons
and
see
how
thing
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
keep
about
the
lobby
for
an
hour
or
so
,
"
say
Brewer
,
with
a
deeply
mysterious
countenance
,
"
and
if
thing
look
well
,
I
will
not
come
back
,
but
will
order
my
cab
for
nine
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
could
not
do
better
,
"
say
Podsnap
.
  
<EOS>
veneering
express
his
inability
ever
to
acknowledge
this
last
service
.
<EOS>
tear
stand
in
Mrs.
Veneering

affectionate

<EOS>
boot
show

point
the

the

whenever

could

could
throw
off
the
bedclothe
of
the
custard

accustom

settle

in

the

"
if
I

this

your
dangerous
fascination
have
produce
some
effect

I
mention
the
conquest

I
apprehend
your

more
important

your
vanity

"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a

the
principal

have
have
no
part

expressive
transaction

<EOS>
It
may
have
be
that
Mrs.

try
in
some
manner
to
excuse
her
conduct
to
herself
by
depreciate
the
poor
little
victim
of

she
speak
with
acrimonious
contempt

<EOS>
It
may
have
be
too
that
in

she
do

it

resist
confidence

she
know
she

nothing
more
be

perhaps
conspirator
who

may
not
be
overfond
of
repeat
the
term

object
of
their
conspiracy

<EOS>
next

come

come
Georgiana

be
call

neither

simply

it
would
have

hard
for

Georgiana

to
determine
whether
its
frequenter

man
of
pleasure

<EOS>
between

both

gaudy

the

in

there
he

make
a
conversation
between
Fledgeby

the
follow
ingenious

skilful
manner

They

Fascination

Mr.

<EOS>
at
time
Mrs.

would
lean
forward
to
address
Mr.

<EOS>
"
Alfred

my

very
justly

apropos
of

constancy
would
not
require
any
such
stimulant

the
stage
deem
necessary
.
"
<EOS>
to
which
Mr.
Lammle
would
reply
,
"
ay

Sophronia
,

love
,
but
as
Georgiana
have
observe
to
me
,
the
lady
have
no
sufficient
reason
to

the
state
of
the
gentleman
's
affection

<EOS>
"
to
which
Mrs.
Lammle
would
rejoin

Alfred

Mr.

point
out

"
this
.
<EOS>
to
which
Alfred
would
demur
:
"
undoubtedly

Sophronia

but
Georgiana
acutely
remark
,
"
 
that
.
<EOS>
through
this
device
the
two
young
people
converse
at
great
length
and
commit
themselves
to
a
variety
of
delicate
sentiment
,
without
have
once
open
their
lip
,
save
to
say
yes
or
no
,
and
even
that
not
to
one
another

<EOS>
Fledgeby
take
his
leave
of
Miss
Podsnap
at
the
carriage
door
,
and
the
Lammles
drop
her
at
her
own
home
,
and
on
the
way
Mrs.
Lammle
archly
rally
her
,
in
her
fond
and
protect
manner
,
by
say
at
interval
,
"
oh
little
Georgiana

little
Georgiana

be
not

the

add

thus
the
Lammles
get
home
at
last

sit
down
moody

weary

look
at
her
dark
lord
engage
in
a
deed
of
violence

he
be
wring

some
unlucky

as
he
wipe
his

Fledgeby

offend

Fledgeby

offend

<EOS>
Fledgeby

<EOS>
She
have
even
the

would
have
have
no
compunction
in
remove

drop
her
clean
outside

cousinly
pale

cousin
for
all
that

<EOS>
among
her
pre

transaction
with
Fledgeby

,
Fledgeby

have
raise
money

<EOS>
the
reversion
fall
in
soon
after
they
be
marry
,
Fledgeby
's
father
lay
hold
of
the
cash
for
his
separate
use

benefit

<EOS>
this
lead
to
subjective
difference

opinion

not

objective
interchange
of

other
such
domestic

between
Fledgeby

Fledgeby

go

<EOS>
now

I
have
hold

I

there
be

now
the

proceed
Fledgeby

no

I

"
perhaps
you
be
right

will
find
yourself
better

Fascination

in
greatly
improved
spirit

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
to
ask
you
if
you
will

another

would
be
unmeane

it

thirsty
all

<EOS>
Will
you
have
some
more
bread

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

I
will
not

repeat
Lammle

<EOS>
"
then
I
will
,

say
fascination

<EOS>
and
it
be
not
a
mere
retort
for
the
sound
's
sake
,
but
be
a
cheerful
cogent
consequence
of
the
refusal
;
for
if
Lammle
have
apply
himself
again
to
the
loaf
,
it
would
have
be
so
heavily
visit
,
in
Fledgeby
's
opinion
,
as
to
demand
abstinence
from
bread
,
on
his
part

for
the
remainder
of
that
meal
at
least
,
if
not
for
the
whole

<EOS>
whether
this
young
gentleman
(
for

twenty

combine
with
the
miserly
vice
of
an
old
man
,
any
of
the
open

handed
vice
of
a
young
one
,
be
a
moot
point
;
so
very
honorably
do
he
keep
his
own
counsel
.
<EOS>
He
be
sensible
of
the
value
of
appearance
as
an
investment
,
and
like
to
dress
well
;
but
he
drive
a
bargain
for
every
moveable
about
him
,
from
the
coat
on
his
back
to
the
china
on
his
breakfast

and
every
bargain

represent
somebody

ruin
or
somebody

loss

acquire
a
peculiar
charm
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
part
of
his
avarice
to
take

within
narrow
bound

long
odd

if
he
win

he
drive
hard
bargain

he
half
starve
himself

why

a

dozen

a
dozen
time
,
twenty
time

to
say
to
me
in
your

odd
manner

which
I
know
<EOS>
so
well
<EOS>
and
like
so
much
,
that
your
disappearance
be
precaution
against
our
boring
one
another

of
course
after
a
short
while
I
begin
to
know
that
they
cover
something
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
ask
what
it
be
,
as
you
have
not
tell
me
;

the
fact

so

I
give
you
my

Eugene

after

serious
pause
of
a
few
moment

that
I

upon

less

<EOS>

You

<EOS>
"
I
really
can

reply
Eugene
,
shake
his
head
blankly

after
pause
again
to
reconsider
.

"
<EOS>
at

no

now

have
be
incline
to
pursue
such
a

absurd

that
it
tired

embarrass
me

absolutely
,
I
can

frankly

faithfully

I
would
if
I

<EOS>
so
reply
,
he
clap
a
hand
,
in
his
turn
,
on
his
friend
's
shoulder
,
as
he
rise
from
his
seat
upon
the
bed
,
and
say
:
  
"
You
must
take
your

You
know
what

my

You
know
how
dreadfully
susceptible
I
be
to
boredom

You
know
that
when
I
become

myself
an

myself

You
know
that
at
length
I
give
it
up
,

decline
to
guess
any
more

can
I
possibly
give
you
the
answer

I
have
not

run
,

no

upon

I
can
not

<EOS>
so
much
of
what
be
fantastically
true
to
his
own
knowledge
of
this
utterly
careless
Eugene
,
mingle
with
the
answer
,
that
Mortimer
could
not
receive
it
as
a
mere
evasion

<EOS>
besides
,
it
be
give
with
an
engage
air
of
openness

of
special
exemption

,
after

either
the

a
knock
at

then
,
draw
in
his

find
the
visitor
to

young
Charley

the
schoolmaster

both
stand
face
him

both
recognize
at
a
glance

You

have
suspect
him

have
throw
up
his

an
angry
start

laughingly
,
Wrayburn
look

an
explanation

yes

too

Bradley

with
consummate
indolence

who
may
this

you

<EOS>
composedly
smoking

he
lean
an
elbow
on
the
chimneypiece
,
at
the
side
of
the
fire

look
at
the
schoolmaster

<EOS>
It
be
a
cruel
look

in
its
cold
disdain

him

as
a
creature
of
no
worth

<EOS>
the
schoolmaster
look
at
him
,

that

too

be
a
cruel
look

though
of
the
different
kind

that
it
have
a
rage
jealousy

fiery
wrath
in
it

<EOS>
very
remarkably
,
neither
Eugene
Wrayburn

Bradley
Headstone

at
all
at
the
boy

<EOS>
through
the
ensue
dialogue
,
those
two

no

who
speak

whom
be
address

look
at
each
other

<EOS>
there
be
some
secret
,
sure
perception
between
them

which
set
them
against
one
another
in
all
way

<EOS>
"
in
some
high
respect
,
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn

Bradley
,
answer
him
with
pale
and
quivering
lip
,
"
the
natural
feeling

my
pupil
be
strong
than
my
teaching

<EOS>
"
in
most
respect
,
I
dare

reply
Eugene
,
enjoy
his
cigar

though
whether
high

low
be
of
no

correctly

what

sharply

him
short
at
his

I
can

respectable
title

<EOS>
You
be
right

Schoolmaster

"
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
dull
part
of
this
goad
in
its
galling
of
Bradley
Headstone
,
that
he
have
make
it
himself
in
a
moment
of
incautious
anger

He
try
to
set
his
lip
so

prevent
their
quivering

they
quiver
fast

<EOS>
for
a
mere
moment
,
Wrayburn
turn
his
eye
aside
from
the

to
note
the
effect
of
the
last
word
on
Mortimer

who
,
stand
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
,
as
soon
as
the

turn
his
face
towards

look
down
into
it

"
similarly
,
it
be
through

You

I
want
to
know
why

"
  
<EOS>
"
be
this
worth
while
,
Schoolmaster

"
<EOS>
murmured
Eugene
,
with
the
air
of
a
disinterested
adviser
.
<EOS>
"
so
much
trouble
for
nothing

<EOS>
You
should
know
best

I

not

<EOS>
"
I
do
not

answer
Bradley

with
his
passion
rise
,
<EOS>
"
why
you
address
me

"
do
not
you
?

say
Eugene

<EOS>
"
then
I
will
not

"
  
<EOS>
He
say
it
so
tauntingly
in
his
perfect
placidity
,
that
the
respectable
right
-
hand
,
clutch
the
respectable
hair
-
guard
of
the
respectable
watch
could
have
wind
it
round
his
throat

strangle
him
with
it

<EOS>
not
another
word
do
Eugene
deem
it
worth
while
to
utter
,
but
stand
lean
his
head
upon
his
hand
,
smoking
,
and
look
imperturbably
at
the
chafe
Bradley
Headstone
with
his
clutch
right
-
hand
,
until
Bradley
be
wellnigh
mad
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.

proceed
the
boy

we
not
only
know
this

out

We
have
a

Mr.

for

what

what

why

We
find
that

give
an
unwilling

cold
ear

our
scheme

her
advantage

I
,
her
brother

<EOS>
the
boyish
weakness
of
this
speech

combine
with
its
great
selfishness
,
make
it
a
poor
one
indeed

yet
Bradley
Headstone

use
to
the
little
audience
of
a
school

unused
to
the
large
way
of
man
,
show
a
kind
of
exultation
in
it

"
now
I
tell
Mr.

Wrayburn

pursue
the

force
into
the
use

the
hopelessness

him

off

I
object
to
it

that
be
enough

<EOS>
I
be
more
important
to
my

he
think

as
I
raise
myself
,
I
intend
to
raise
her
;
she
know
that

she
have
to
look
to
me

her
prospect

<EOS>
now
I
understand
all
this
very
well

so
do
Mr.

.
<EOS>
My
sister
be
an
excellent
girl
,
but
she
have
some
romantic
notion
;
 
not
about
such
thing
as
your
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburns
,
but
about
the
death
of
my
father

other
matter
of
that
sort

<EOS>
Mr.
Wrayburn
encourage
those
notion
to
make
himself
of
importance
,

so
she
think
she
ought
be
grateful
to
him
,

perhaps
even
like
to
be
.
<EOS>
now
I
do
not
choose
her
to
be
grateful
to
him
,

to
be
grateful
to
anybody

me
,
except
Mr.

<EOS>

I
tell
Mr.
Wrayburn
that
if
he
do
not
take
heed
of
what
I
say

it
will
be
bad
for
her

<EOS>
let
him
turn
that
over

make
sure
of

be
originate

<EOS>
the
arrangement
between
Mr.
Boffin

his
literary
man
,
Mr.
Silas
Wegg
,
so
far
altered
with
the
altered
habit
of
Mr.
Boffin
's
life
,
as
that
the
Roman
Empire
usually
decline
in
the
morning
and
in
the
eminently
aristocratic
family
mansion
,
rather
than
in
the
evening

as
of

Bower

there
be
occasion
,
however
,

seek
a
brief
refuge
from

blandishment

would
present
himself
at
the
Bower
after
dark
,
to
anticipate
the
next
sallying
forth
of
Wegg
,
and
would
there
,
on
the
old
settle
,
pursue
the
downward
fortune
of
those
enervate
and
corrupt
master
of
the
world
who
be
by
this
time
on
their
last
leg
.
<EOS>
if
Wegg
have
be
bad
pay
for
his
office
,
or
better
qualified
to
discharge
it
,
he
would
have
consider
these
visit
complimentary
and
agreeable
;
but
,
hold
the
position
of
a
handsomely
-
remunerate
humbug
,
he
resent
them
.
<EOS>
this
be
quite
accord
to

the
most
imbecile
in

have
uniformly
show
themselves
the
most
opposed
(
sometimes
in
belie
distrust
,
sometimes
in
vapid
insolence
)
to
their
employer
.
<EOS>
what
be
in
such
wise
true

public
master

equally
true
of

private
master

all
the

<EOS>
when
Mr.

Wegg
do
at
last
obtain
free
access
to

as
he
have
be
will
not

call
the
mansion
outside

he
have
sit
shelterless
so
long
,
and
when
he
do
at

find
it
in
all
particular
as
different
from

require

rouse
with

object

you
will
have
a
glorious
object

<EOS>
Mr.

then
go
on

enlarge

be
uppermost

crafty
mind

---
the
qualification
of

for
such
a
search
.
<EOS>
He
expatiate
on
Mr.

's
patient
habit
and
delicate
manipulation
;
on
his
skill
in
piece
little
thing
together
;
on
his
knowledge
of
various
tissue
and
texture
;
on
the
likelihood
of
small
indication
lead
him
on
to
the
discovery
of
great
concealment
.
<EOS>
"
while
as
to
myself
,
"
say
Wegg
,
"
I
be
not
good
at
it
.
<EOS>
whether
I
give
myself
up
to
prodding
,
or
whether
I
give
myself
up
to
scooping
,
I
could
not
do
it
with
that
delicate
touch
so
as
not
to
show
that
I
be
disturb
the

<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
next
modestly
remark
on
the
want
of
adaptation
in
a
wooden
leg
to
ladder
and
such
like
airy
perch
,
and
also
hint
at
an
inherent
tendency
in
that
timber
fiction
,
when
call
into
action
for
the
purpose
of
a
promenade
on
an
ashey
slope

to
stick
itself
into

foothold

peg
its

on
the
special
phenomenon
that
before

Bower

it
be
from
Mr.
Venus
that
he
first
hear
of
the
legend
of
hide
wealth
in
the

which

observe
with
a
vaguely
pious

lastly

he
return
to

gloomily
foreshadow
the
possibility
of
something

criminate
Mr.

of
whom
he
once
more
candidly
admit
it
can
not
be

that
he
profit
by
a
murder

anticipate
his
denunciation
by
the
friendly
mover
to
avenge
justice

<EOS>
and
this
,
Mr.

expressly
point
out
,
not

though
it
would
be
a
want
of

take
it

<EOS>
to
all
this
,
Mr.

,
with
his
shock
of
dusty
hair

after
the
manner
of

attend
profoundly
.
<EOS>
when
Mr.

at

You

hardly

I
have

reply
Wegg
,
a
little
dash
by
the
hint

<EOS>
"
I
have
just

"
if

apparently
,
Mr.

into

plunge

It
be
such
unspeakable
moral
compensation
to
Wegg

to
be
overcome
by
the
consideration
that
Mr.

have
an
underhanded

<EOS>

both
be
something

again

on

hour
!
"
   
<EOS>
in
which
an
innocent
ELOPEMENT
OCCURS
.
 
<EOS>
the
minion
of
fortune
and
the
worm
of
the
hour
,
or
in
less
cutting
language
,
Nicodemus
Boffin
,
Esquire
,
the
golden
Dustman
,
have
become
as
much
at
home
in
his
eminently
aristocratic
family
mansion
as
he
be
likely
ever
to
be
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
but
feel
that
,
like
an
eminently
aristocratic
family
cheese
,
it
be
much
too
large
for
his
want
,
and
breed
an
infinite
amount
of
parasite
;
but
he
be
content
to
regard
this
drawback
on
his
property
as
a
sort
of
perpetual
Legacy
Duty
.
<EOS>
He
feel
the
more
resigned
to
it
,
forasmuch
as
Mrs.
Boffin
enjoy
herself
completely
,
and
Miss
Bella
be
delighted
.
  
<EOS>
that
young
lady
be
,
no
doubt
,
an
acquisition
to
the
Boffins
.
<EOS>
She
be
far
too
pretty
to
be
unattractive
anywhere
,
and
far
too
quick
of
perception
to
be
below
the
tone
of
her
new
career
.
<EOS>
whether
it
improve
her
heart
may
be
a
matter
of
taste
that
be
open
to
question
;
 
but
as
touch
another
matter
of
taste
,
its
improvement
of
her
appearance
and
manner
,
there
could
be
no
question
whatever
.
  
<EOS>
and
thus
it
soon
come
about
that
Miss
Bella
begin
to
set
Mrs.
Boffin
right
;
and
even
further
,
that
Miss
Bella
begin
to
feel
ill
at
ease
,
and
as
it
be
responsible
,
when
she
see
Mrs.
Boffin
go
wrong
.
<EOS>
not
that
so
sweet
a
disposition
and
so
sound
a
nature
<EOS>
could
ever
go
very
wrong
even
among
the
great
visit
authority
who
agree
that
the
Boffins
be
"
charmingly
vulgar
"
(
which
for
certain
be
not
their
own
case
in
say
so
)
,
but
that
when
she
make
a
slip
on
the
social
ice
on
which
all
the
child
of
Podsnappery
,
with
genteel
soul
to
be
save
,
be
require
to
skate
in
circle
,
or
to
slide
in
long
row
,
she
inevitably
trip
Miss
Bella
up
(
so
that
young
lady
feel
)
,
and
cause
her
to
experience
great
confusion
under
the
glance
of
the
more
skilful
performer
engage
in
those
ice
-
exercise
.
  
<EOS>
at
Miss
Bella
's
time
of
life
it
be
not
be
expect
that
she
should
examine
herself
very
closely
on
the
congruity
or
stability
of
her
position
in
Mr.
Boffin
's
house
.
<EOS>
and
as
she
have
never
be
spare
of
complaint
of
her
old
home
when
she
have
no
other
to
compare
it
with
,
so
there
be
no
novelty
of
ingratitude
or
disdain
in
her
very
much
prefer
her
new
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
an
invaluable
man
be
Rokesmith
,
"
say
Mr.
Boffin
,
after
some
two
or
three
month
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
can
not
quite
make
him
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
neither
could
Bella
,
so
she
find
the
subject
rather
interesting
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
take
more
care
of
my
affair
,
morning
,
noon
,
and
night

"
say
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
than
fifty
other
man
put
together
either
could
or
would

and
yet
he
have
way
of
his
own

be
like
tie
a
scaffolding

pole
right
across
the
road

bring
me
up
short

it
over

with
a
shake

after
again
think
it
over

odd
anomaly

the

spoilt

spoilt

by
poverty

by
wealth

be
it
this
history

to
leave

to
unravel
themselves

a
little

much

I

scornfully

to
have
Pa

lodger
lay
claim
to
me

keep
eligible
people
off

<EOS>
a
little
too
much

indeed

to
have
the
opportunity
open
to
me
by
Mr.

appropriate
by
a
mere
Secretary

Pa

lodger

"
  
<EOS>
yet
it
be
not
so
very
long
ago
that
Bella
have
be
flutter
by
the
discovery
that
this
same
Secretary
and
lodger
seem
to
like
her
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
but
the
eminently
aristocratic
mansion
and
Mrs.
Boffin
's
dressmaker
have
not
come
into
play
then
.
  
<EOS>
in
spite
of
his
seemingly
retire
manner
a
very
intrusive
person
,
this
Secretary
and
lodger
,
in
Miss
Bella
's
opinion
.
<EOS>
always
a
light
in
his
office
-
room
when
we
come
home
from
the
play
or
opera
,
and
he
always
at
the
carriage
-
door
to
hand
us
out
.
<EOS>
always
a
provoking
radiance
too
on
Mrs.
Boffin
's
face
,
and
an
abominably
cheerful
reception
of
him
,
as
if
it
be
possible
seriously
to
approve
what
the
man
have
in
his
mind
!
  
<EOS>
"
You
never
charge
me

Wilfer

the
Secretary
,

her
by
chance
alone
in
the
great
drawing

room
,

with
commission
for
home

<EOS>
I
shall
always
be
happy
to
execute
any
command
you
may
have
in

direction

you

<EOS>
She
colour
under
the
retort

so
skilfully
thrust
,
that
the
word
seem
to
be
merely
a
plain
answer
,
give
in
plain
good
faith

say
,
rather
more
emphatically

sharply
:
  
"
what
commission

command
be
you
speak
of

<EOS>
"
  
"
only
such
little
word
of

the
Secretary
with
his
former
air

"
It
would
be
a
pleasure
to
me

two
incident

feel
by
Miss

curious

the
first
be
,
that

unquestionably
leave
her

a
penitent
air
upon

a
penitent
feeling
in

the
second
be

that

have
announce
it
to

what
can
I

it
,

what
can
he

"
be
her
mental
inquiry
:
"
<EOS>
He
have
no
right
to
any
power
over
me

and
how
do
I
come
to
mind
him
when
I
do
not

for
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin

insist
that
Bella
should
make
to

morrow
's
expedition
in
the
chariot
<EOS>
,
she
go
home
in
great
grandeur
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilfer

Miss
Lavinia
have
speculate
much
on
the
probability
and
improbability
of
her
come
in
this
gorgeous
state
,
and
,
on
behold
the
chariot
from
the
window
at
which
they
be
secrete
to
look
out
for
it
,
agree
that
it
must
be
detain
at
the
door
as
long
as
possible
,
for
the
mortification
and
confusion
of
the
neighbour

<EOS>
then
they
repair
to
the
usual
family
room
,
to
receive
Miss
Bella
with
a
become
show
of
indifference

the

room
look
very
small

very
mean

and
the
downward
staircase
by
which
it

look
very
narrow

very
crooked
.
<EOS>
the
little
house
and
all
its
arrangement
be
a
poor
contrast
to
the
eminently
aristocratic
dwelling

"
I
can
hardly
believe

that
I
ever

place

Gloomy
majesty
on

part

think
about

after

"
supposing
that
a

have
to
go
through

we

It

be

none

keep
time

for

if

take
his

his

her

unbeknownst

"
  
<EOS>
Sloppy
know
his
ground
well
.
<EOS>
to
conceal
herself
in
sickness
,
like
a
low
animal
;
to
creep
out
of
sight
and
coil
herself
away
and
die
;
have
become
this
woman
's
instinct
.
<EOS>
to
catch
up
in
her
arm
the
sick
child
who
be
dear
to
her
,
and
hide
it
as
if
it
be
a
criminal
,
and
keep
off
all
ministration
but
such
as
her
own
ignorant
tenderness
and
patience
could
supply
,
have
become
this
woman
's
idea
of
maternal
love
,
fidelity

duty

<EOS>
the
shameful
account
we
read

every

the
infamous
record

small
official
inhumanity

do
not
pass
by
the
people
as
they
pass
by
us

<EOS>
and
hence
these
irrational
,
blind
,
and
obstinate
prejudice
,
so
astonishing
to
our
magnificence
,
and
have
no
more
reason
in

God

find

"
It

not

Mrs.

<EOS>
"
tell
us

<EOS>
He
have
already
think
what
to
do

the
consultation
be
very
short

<EOS>
He
could
pave
the
way

he
say
,
in

an
hour

then
they
would
go
down
to
Brentford
.

therefore
a

in

behold
that
splendid

as

,
Johnny
murmur
something

closed

be
ask
by
her
to
repeat
what

he
do
so
two

three

then
it
come
out
that
he
must
have
see
more
than
they
suppose

look
up

the
murmur

the
boofer

"
now
,
the
boofer
,

beautiful

lady
be
Bella
;
and
whereas
this
notice
from
the
poor
baby
would
have
touch
her
of
itself

it
be
render
more
pathetic
by
the
late
melting
of
her
heart
to
her
poor
little
father

their
joke
about

lovely
woman

<EOS>
He

however

there
Johnny
come
to
himself
,
out
of
a
sleep
or
a
swoon
or
whatever
it
be

to
find
himself
lie
in
a
little
quiet
bed

with
a
little
platform
over
his

on

give
him
heart
and
urge
him
to
cheer
up
,
the
Noah

ark
,
the
noble
steed
,
and
the
yellow
bird
;
with
the
officer
in
the
Guards
do
duty
over
the
whole
,
quite
as
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
country
as
if
he
have
be
upon
Parade
.
<EOS>
and
at
the
bed
's
head
be
a
colored
picture
beautiful
to
see
,
represent
as
it
be
another
Johnny
seat
on
the
knee
of
some
Angel
surely
who
love
little
child
.
<EOS>
and
,
marvellous
fact
,
to
lie
and
stare
at
:
Johnny
have
become
one
of
a
little
family
,
all
in
little
quiet
bed
(
except
two
play
domino
in
little
arm
-
chair
at
a
little
table
on
the
hearth
)
:
<EOS>
and
on
all
the
little
bed
be
little
platform
<EOS>
whereon
be
to
be
see
doll
'
house
,
<EOS>
woolly
dog
with
mechanical
bark
in
them
not
very
dissimilar
from

artificial
voice
pervade
the
bowel
of
the
yellow
bird
,
tin
army
,
moorish
tumbler
,
wooden
tea
thing
,
and
the
rich
of
the
earth
.
  
<EOS>
as
Johnny
murmur
something
in
his
placid
admiration
,
the
minister
woman
at
his
bed
's
head
ask
him
what
he
say
.
<EOS>
It
seem
that
he
want
to
know
whether
all
these
be
brother
and
sister
of
his
?
<EOS>
so
they
tell
him
yes
.
<EOS>
It
seem
then
,
that
he
want
to
know
whether
God
have
bring
them
all
together
there
?
<EOS>
so
they
tell
him
yes
again
.
<EOS>
They
make
out
then
,
that
he
want
to
know
whether
they
would
all
get
out
of
pain
?
<EOS>
so
they
answer
yes
to
that
question
likewise
,
and
make
him
understand
that
the
reply
include
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Johnny
's
power
of
sustain
conversation
be
as
yet
so
very
imperfectly
develop
,
even
in
a
state
of
health
,
that
in
sickness
they
be
little
more
than
monosyllabic
.
<EOS>
but
,
he
have
to
be
wash
and
tend
,
and
remedy
be
apply
,
and
though
those
office
be
far
,
far
more
skilfully
and
lightly
do
than
ever
anything
have
be
do
for
him
in
his
little
life
,
so
rough
and
short
,
they
would
have
hurt
and
tire
him
but
for
an
amazing
circumstance
which
lay
hold
of
his
attention
.
<EOS>
this
be
no
less
than
the
appearance
on
his
own
little
platform
in
pair
,
of
all
Creation
,
on
its
way
into
his
own
particular
ark
:
the
elephant
lead
,
and
the
fly
,
with
a
diffident
sense
of
his
size
,
politely
bring
up
the
rear
.
<EOS>
a
very
little

lie
in
the
next
bed
with
a
break
leg

be
so
enchant
by
this
spectacle
that
his
delight
exalt
its
enthral
interest
;
and
so
come
rest
and
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
be
not
afraid
to
leave
the
dear
child
here
,
Betty

"
whisper
Mrs.
Boffin

<EOS>
"
no

<EOS>
most
willingly
,
most
thankfully
,
with
all
my
heart
and
soul

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
,
they
kiss
him
,
and
leave
him
there
,
and
old
Betty
be
to
come
back
early
in
the
morning
,
and
nobody
but
Rokesmith
know
for
certain
how
that
the

have
say
,
"
this

too
late

<EOS>
but
,
Rokesmith
know
it
,
and
know
that
his
bear
it
in
mind
would
be
acceptable
thereafter
to
that
good
woman
who
have
be
the
only
light
in
the
childhood
of
desolate
John
Harmon
dead
and
go
,
resolve
that
late
at
night
he
would
go
back
to
the
bedside
of
John
Harmon
's
namesake
,
and
see
how
it
fare
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
family
whom
God
have
bring
together
be
not
all
asleep

but
be
all
quiet

<EOS>
from
bed
to
bed
,
a
light
womanly
tread
and
a
pleasant
fresh
face
pass
in
the
silence
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
a
little
head
would
lift
itself
up
into
the
softened
light
here
and
there
,
to
be
kiss
as
the
face
go
by
---
for
these
little
patient

very
loving

and
would
then
submit
itself
to
be
compose
to
rest
again
.
<EOS>
the
mite
with
the
break
leg
be
restless
,
and
moan
;
but
after
a
while
turn
his
face
towards
Johnny
's
bed
,
to
fortify
himself
with
a
view
of
the
ark
,
and
fall
asleep
.
<EOS>
over
most
of
the
bed

the
child
have
leave
them
when
they
last
lay
themselves
down

and
,
in
their
innocent
grotesqueness
and
incongruity
,
they
may
have
stand
for
the
child

dream

<EOS>
the
doctor
come
in
too
,
to
see
how
it
fare
with
Johnny

<EOS>
and
he
and
Rokesmith
stand
together
,
look
down
with
compassion
on
him

<EOS>
"
what
be
it

Johnny

<EOS>
"
Rokesmith

put

make
a
struggle

<EOS>
"
Him

say
the

<EOS>
"
those

<EOS>
the

be
quick
to
understand
child

and
,
take
the
horse
,
the
ark
,
the
yellow
bird
,
and
the
man
in
the
Guards
,
from
Johnny

bed
,
softly
place
them
on
that
of
his
next
neighbour

the
mite
with
the
break
leg

<EOS>
with
a
weary
and
yet
a
pleased
smile

and
with
an
action
as
if
he
stretch
his
little
figure
out
to
rest
,
the
child
heave
his
body
on
the
sustaining
arm
,
and
seek
Rokesmith
's
face
with
his
lip
,
say
:
  
"
<EOS>
a
kiss
for
the
boofer
lady

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
have
now
bequeath
all
he

in

thus

<EOS>
a
SUCCESSOR
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
the
Reverend
Frank
Milvey
's
brother
have
find
themselves
exceedingly
uncomfortable
in
their
mind
,
because
they
be
require
to
bury
the
dead
too
hopefully
.
<EOS>
but
,
the
Reverend
Frank
,
incline
to
the
belief
that
they
be
require
to
do
one
or
two
other
thing
(
say
out
of
nine
-
and
-
thirty
)
calculate
to
trouble
their
conscience
rather
more
if
they
would
think
as
much
about
them
,
<EOS>
hold
his
peace
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
Reverend
Frank
Milvey
be
a
forbear
man
,
who
notice
many
sad
warp
and
blight
in
the
vineyard
wherein
he
work
,
and
do
not
profess
that
they
make
him
savagely
wise
.
<EOS>
He
only
learn
that
the
more
he
himself
know
,
<EOS>
in
his
little
limited
human
way
,
the
well
he
could
distantly
imagine
what
Omniscience
may
know
.
  
<EOS>
Wherefore
,
if
the
Reverend
Frank
have
have
to
read
the
word
that
trouble
some
of
his
brother
,
and
profitably
touch
innumerable
heart
,
in
a
bad
case
than
Johnny
's
,
he
would
have
do
so
out
of
the
pity
and
humility
of
his
soul
.
<EOS>
read
them
over
Johnny
,
he
think
of
his
own
six
child
,
but
not
of
his
poverty
,
and
read
them
with
dimmed
eye
.
<EOS>
and
very
seriously
do
he
and
his
bright
little
wife
,
who
have
be
listen
,
look
down
into
the
small
grave
and
walk
home
arm
-
in
-
arm
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
grief
in
the
aristocratic
house
,
and
there
be
joy
in
the
Bower
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
argue
,
if
an
orphan
be
want
,
be
he
not
an
orphan
himself
,
and
could
a
well
be
desire
?
<EOS>
and
why
go
beat
about
Brentford
bush
,
seek
orphan
forsooth
who
have
establish
no
claim
upon
you
and
make
no
sacrifice
for
you
,
when
here
be
an
orphan
ready
to
your
hand
who
have
give
up
in
your
cause
,
Miss
Elizabeth
,
Master
George

Aunt
Jane

and
Uncle
Parker
?
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
chuckle
,
consequently
,
when
he
hear
the
tiding
.
<EOS>
nay
,
it
be
afterwards
affirm
by
a
witness
who
shall
at
present
be
nameless
,
that
in
the
seclusion
of
the
Bower
he
poke
out
his
wooden
leg
,
in
the
stage

ballet
manner
,
and
execute
a
taunting

triumphant
pirouette
on
the
genuine

to
him

<EOS>
John
Rokesmith
's
manner
towards
Mrs.
Boffin
at
this
time
,
be
more
the
manner
of
a
young
man
towards
a
mother
,
than
that
of
a
Secretary
towards
his
employer
's
wife
.
<EOS>
It
have
always
be
mark
by
a
subdued
affectionate
deference
that
seem
to
have
spring
up
on
the
very
day
of
his
engagement
;
whatever
be
odd
in
her
dress
or
her
way
have
seem
to
have
no
oddity
for
him
;
he
have
sometimes
bear
a
quietly
-
amused
face
in
her
company
,
but
still
it
have
seem
as
if
the
pleasure
her
genial
temper
and
radiant
nature
yield
him
,
could
have
be
quite
as
naturally
express
in
a
tear
as
in
a
smile
.
<EOS>
the
completeness

attract
attention

little
vague
trepidation

the
subject

matter
of

that
worthy
soul

comfortable
place

Mr.

have
send
me
the
kind
note
possible
(
which
Mr.

just
now
read
to
me
out
loud

for
I
be
not
good
at
handwritings

offer

another
little

<EOS>
"

this
have
set
me
think

I

,
"
repeat
Mrs.
Boffin
,
cordially
beam
under
the
influence
of
her
husband
's
compliment
,
"
and
I
have
think
two
thing
.
<EOS>
first
of
all
,
that
I
have
grow
timid
of
revive
John
Harmon
's
name
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
unfortunate
name
,
and
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
should
reproach
myself
if
I
give
it
to
another
dear
child
,
and
it
prove
again
unlucky
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
now
,
whether
,
"
say
Mr.
Boffin
,
gravely
propound
a
case
for
his
Secretary
's
opinion
;
"
whether
one
may
call
that
a
superstition
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
matter
of
feel
with
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
say
Rokesmith
,
gently
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
name
have
always
be
unfortunate
.
<EOS>
It
have
now
this
new
unfortunate
association
connect
with
it
.
<EOS>
the
name
have
die
out
.
<EOS>
why
revive
it
?
<EOS>
may
I
ask
Miss
Wilfer
what
she
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
have
not
be
a
fortunate
name
for
me
,
"
say
Bella
,
colouring
---
  
"
or
at
least
it
be
not
,
until
it
lead
to
my
being
here
---
<EOS>
but
that
be
not
the
point
in
my
thought
.
<EOS>
as
we
have
give
the
name
to
the
poor
child
and
as
the
poor
child
take
so
lovingly
to
me
,
I
think
I
should
feel
jealous
of
call
another
child
by
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
feel
as
if
the
name
have
become
endear
to
me
,
and
I
have
no
right
to
use
it
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
that
be
your
opinion
?
<EOS>
"
remark
Mr.
Boffin
,
observant
of
the
Secretary
's
face
and
again
address
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
again
,
it
be
a
matter
of
feeling
,
"
return
the
Secretary
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
Miss
Wilfer
's
feel
very
womanly
and
pretty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
give
us
your
opinion
,
Noddy
,
"
say
Mrs.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
opinion
,
old
lady
,
"
return
the
golden
Dustman
,
"
be
your
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
"
say
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
we
agree
not
to
revive
John
Harmon
's
name
,
but
to
let
it
rest
in
the
grave
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
as
Mr.
Rokesmith
say
,
a
matter
of
feeling
,
but
Lor
how
many
matter
be
matter
of
feeling
!
<EOS>
well
;
and
so
I
come
to
the
second
thing
I
have
think
of
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
Bella
,
my
dear
,
and
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
that
when
I
first
name
to
my
husband
my
thought
of
adopt
a
little
orphan
boy
in
remembrance
of
John
Harmon
,
I
further
name
to
my
husband
that
it
be
comfort
to
think
that
how
the
poor
boy
would
be
benefit
by
John
's
own
money
,
and
protect
from
John
's
own
forlornness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hear
,
hear
!
"
cry
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
so
she
do
.
<EOS>
ancoar
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
not
ancoar
,
Noddy
,
my
dear
,
"
return
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
because
I
be
go
to
say
something
else
.
<EOS>
I
mean
that
,
I
be
sure
,
as
much
as
I
still
mean
it
.
<EOS>
but
this
little
death
have
make
me
ask
myself
the
question
,
seriously
,
whether
I
be
not
too
bent
upon
please
myself
.
<EOS>
else
why
do
I
seek
out
so
much
for
a
pretty
child
,
and
a
child
quite
to
my
liking
?
<EOS>
want
to
do
good
,
why
not
do
it
for
its
own
sake
,
and
put
my
taste
and
liking
by
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
"
say
Bella
;
and
perhaps
she
say
it
with
some
little
sensitiveness
arise
out
of
those
old
curious
relation
of
her
towards
the
murdered
man
;
"
perhaps
,
in
revive
the
name
,
you
would
not
have
like
to
give
it
to
a
less
interesting
child
than
the
original
.
<EOS>
He
interest
you
very
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear

"
return
Mrs.
Boffin
,
give
her
a
squeeze
,
"
<EOS>
it
be
kind
of
you
to
find
that
reason
out
,
and
I
hope
it
may
have
be
so
,
and
indeed
to
a
certain
extent
<EOS>
I
believe
it
be
so
,
but
I
be
afraid
not
to
the
whole
extent
.
<EOS>
however
,
that
do
not
come
in
question
now

because
we
have
do
with
the
name

it
up
as
a
remembrance

better

my

it
up

well
then

I

take
any
orphan
to
provide
for

let
it
not
be

pet

a
plaything
for
me

a
creature
to

pretty
then

Bella

honest

if
I
be
very
much
in

quite
determined

let
me
take
care

him

<EOS>
here
the
footman

the
former
occasion

appear

apologetically

the
fact

begin
Bradley
,
with
a

so
dry
that
he
have
some
difficulty
in
articulate
his
word

the
consciousness

which
render
his

still
more
ungainly

undecided

ask

what

I

the

steal
another
look

superfluous

My
allusion
be
to
this
matter

your
have
put
aside
your

plan
for
you

give
the
preference
to
those
of
Mr.

I
believe
the

Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn

<EOS>
He
make
this
point
of
not
be
certain
of

another
uneasy
look

drop
like
the
last

nothing
be

on

side

he
have
to
begin
again

with
new
embarrassment

"
Your
brother

plan
be
communicate
to
me

he
first
have
them
in

in
point
of
fact
he
speak
to
me
about
them

I
be
last
here

when
we
be
walk
back
together

I
---
when
the
impression
be
fresh
upon
me
of
have
see
his
sister

"
  
<EOS>
there
may
have
be
no
meaning
in
it
,

the
little
dressmaker
here
remove
one
of
her
support
hand
from
her
chin
,

musingly
turn
the
honorable
Mrs.
T.
with
her
face
to
the
company

that
do
,
she
fall
into
her
former
attitude

<EOS>
"
I
approve
of
his
idea

"

Bradley
,
with
his
uneasy
look
wander
to
the
doll
,

unconsciously
rest
there
longer
than
it

rest
on
Lizzie

both
because
your
brother

naturally

be
the
originator

able

promote
it

should
have

inexpressible
pleasure

I

inexpressible

I
must
acknowledge
that
when
your

disappoint

I

disappointed

avoid
reservation

He

so
far

<EOS>
at
all
event
he
go
on
with
much
great
firmness

force
of
emphasis
:
though
with
a
curious
disposition
to
set
his
tooth
,
and
with
a
curious
tight
-
screw
movement
of
his
right
hand
in
the
clench
palm
of
his
left
,
like
the
action
of
one
who
be
be
physically
hurt

be
unwilling
to
cry
out

<EOS>
"
I
be
a
man

to
keep
it
down

have
take
the
matter
so
much
to
heart

remonstrate

remonstrate

quite
ineffectually

red

so
for

deadly
white

finally

you

retract
the
course

confide
in
a

a
person

most
insolent
behaviour

a
touch

fear

him
very
steadily

thirty
shilling
a

at

likewise
conduct
the

upon

equitable
principle

she
have
that
tenderness

those
feeling

that
the
moment

she

this

with
a
grim
sort
of
admiration

him

perfect
piece

evil

what
a

you
be

and
,
nod
his

twice

thrice
over
the

pass
out

,
to
Pleasant
he
say
good

night
kindly

<EOS>
the
honest
man
who
gain
his
living
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
remain
in
a
state
akin
to
stupefaction

until
the
footless
glass
and
the
unfinished
bottle
convey
themselves
into
his
mind
.
<EOS>
from
his
mind
he
convey
them
into
his
hand

so
convey
the
last
of
the
wine
into
his
stomach

when
that
be
do
,
he
awake
to
a
clear
perception
that
Poll
Parroting
be
solely
chargeable
with
what
have
pass
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
not
to
be
remiss
in
his
duty
as
a
father
,
he
throw
a
pair
of
sea
-
boot
at
Pleasant
,
which
she
duck
to
avoid
,

then
cry
,
poor
thing
,
use
her
hair
for
a
pocket

handkerchief
.
   
<EOS>
a
SOLO
and
<EOS>
a
DUETT

<EOS>
the
wind
be
blow
so
hard
when
the

come
out
at
the
shop

door
into
the
darkness

dirt
of
Limehouse
Hole

it
almost
blow
him
in

indifferent
to
the
weather
,
and
even
prefer
it
to
well
weather
for
its
clearance
of
the
street

man
look
about
him
with
a
scrutinize
glance

thus
much
I

murmur

I
have
never

I
recognize

I
wonder
which
way
do
we
take
when
we
come
out

that
shop

We
turn
to
the
right
as
I

I
can
recall
no
more

do
we
go
by
this
alley
?

down
that
little
lane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
try
both
,
but
both
confuse
him
equally
,
and
he
come
stray
back
to
the
same
spot
.
<EOS>
"
I
remember
there
be
pole
push
out
of
upper
window
on
which
clothe
be
dry
,
and
I
remember
a
low
public
-
house
,
and
the
sound
flow
down
a
narrow
passage
belong
to
it
of
the
scraping
of
a
fiddle
and
the
shuffling
of
foot
.
<EOS>
but
here
be
all
these
thing
in
the
lane
,
and
here
be
all
these
thing
in
the
alley
.
<EOS>
and
I
have
nothing
else
in
my
mind
but
a
wall
,
a
dark
doorway
,
a
flight
of
stair
,
and
a
room
.

"
  
<EOS>
He
try
a
new
direction
,

however
,
a
sociable
word
or
two
on
these
mistake
become
an
easy
introduction
between
us
,
and
the
weather
be
hot
,
and
he
help
me
to
a
cool
cabin
on
deck
alongside
his
own
,
and
his
first
school
have
be
at
Brussels
as
mine
have
be
,
and
he
have
learn
French
as
I
have
learn
it
,
and
he
have
a
little
history
of
himself
to
relate
<EOS>

God
only
know
how
much
of
it
true

how

<EOS>
I
have
be
a
seaman
too

<EOS>
so
we
get
to
be
confidential
together
,
and
the
more
easily
yet
,
because
he
and
every
one
on
board
have
know
by
general
rumour
what
I
be
make
the
voyage
to
England
for
.
<EOS>
by
such
degree
and
mean
,
he
come
to
the
knowledge
of
my
uneasiness
of
mind
,
and
of
its
setting
at
that
time
in
the
direction
of
desire
to
see
and
form
some
judgment
of
my
allot
wife
,
before
she
could
possibly
know
me
for
myself
;
also
to
try
Mrs.
Boffin

give
her
a
glad
surprise

<EOS>
so
the
plot
be
make
out
of
our
get
common
sailor
'
dress
(
as
he
be
able
to
guide
me
about
London
)

throw
ourselves
in

try
to
put
ourselves
in

way

do
whatever
chance
may
favour
on
the
spot
,
and
see
what
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
if
nothing
come
of
it
,
I
should
be
no
bad
off
,
and
there
would
merely
be
a
short
delay
in
my
present
myself
to
Lightwood
.
<EOS>
I
have
all
these
fact
right
?
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
accurately
right
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
advantage
in
all
this
be
,
that
for
a
time
I
be
to
be
lose

<EOS>
It
may
be
for
a

for
two
day

I
must
be
lose
sight

there
would
be
recognition

anticipation

failure

<EOS>
therefore
,
I
disembark
with
my
valise
in
my
hand

as
Potterson

steward

Mr.
Jacob
Kibble
<EOS>
my
fellow

passenger
afterwards
remember

wait
for
him
in
the
dark
by
that
very
Limehouse
Church

be
now
behind
me

<EOS>
"
as
I
have
always
shun
the
port

I
only
know
the
church

his
pointing
out

spire
from
on

perhaps
I
may
recall
,
if
it
be
any
good
to
try

the
way
by

I
go

how

go

I

any
more
than
I
know
what
turn
we
take

double
we

after
we
leave
it

<EOS>
the
way
be
purposely
confused

no
doubt

<EOS>

but
let
me
go
on
think
the
fact
out

and
avoid
confuse
them
with
my
speculation

<EOS>
whether
he
take
me
by
a
straight
way

a
crooked
way

what
be
that
to
the
purpose
now

"
when
we
stop
at
Riderhood
's
,

he
ask
that
scoundrel
a
question

two
,
purport
to
refer
only
to
the
lodging
-
house
in
which
there
be
accommodation
for
us
,
have
I
the
least
suspicion
of
him
?
<EOS>
none
.
<EOS>
certainly
none
until
afterwards
when
I
hold
the
clue
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
must
have
get
from
Riderhood
in
a
paper
,
the
drug
,
or
whatever
it
be
,
that
afterwards
stupefy
me
,
but
I
be
far
from
sure
.
<EOS>
all
I
feel
safe
in
charge
on
him
to
-
night
,
be
old
companionship
in
villainy
between
them
.
<EOS>
Their
undisguised
intimacy
,
and
the
character
I
now
know
riderhood
to
bear
,
make
that
not
at
all
adventurous
.
<EOS>

I
be
not
clear
about
the
drug

<EOS>
think
out
the
circumstance
on
which
I
find
my
suspicion
,
they
be
only
two
.
<EOS>
one
<EOS>
:
I
remember
his
change
a
small
fold
paper
from
one
pocket
to
another
,
after
we
come
out
,
which
he
have
not
touch
before
.
<EOS>
two
:
I
now
know
riderhood
to
have
be
previously
take
up
for
be
concern
in
the
robbery
of
an
unlucky
seaman
,
to
whom
some
such
poison
have
be
give
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
conviction
that
we
can
not
have
go
a
mile
from
that
shop
,
before
we
come
to
the
wall
,
the
dark
doorway
,
the
flight
of
stair

the
room
.
<EOS>
the
night
be
particularly
dark

it
rain
hard

<EOS>
as
I
think
the
circumstance
back
,
I
hear
the
rain
splash
on
the
stone
pavement
of
the
passage
,
which
be
not
under
cover
.
<EOS>
the
room
overlook
the
river

the

be
out

of
the

down

know
by
the
hour

it
must
have
be
about
low
water

while
the
coffee
be
get
ready

I
draw
back
the
curtain

a
dark

brown
curtain

look
out

know
by
the
kind
of
reflection

"
now
,
take
no

<EOS>
the
reason
why
John

should
not

<EOS>
because
he
have
passively
allow
these
dear
old
faithful
friend
to
pass
into
possession
of
the
property
.
<EOS>
because
he
see

happy

,
make
a
good
use
of
it
,
efface
the
old
rust
and
tarnish
on
the
money

<EOS>
because
they
have
virtually
adopt
Bella
,
and
will
provide
for
her
.
<EOS>
because
there
be
affection
enough
in
her
nature
,
and
warmth
enough
in
her
heart
,
to
develop
into
something
enduringly
good
,
under
favorable
condition
.
<EOS>
because
her
fault
have
be
intensify
by
her
place
in
my
father
's
will
,
and
she
be
already
grow
well
.
<EOS>
because
her
marriage
with
John
Harmon
,
after
what
I
have
hear
from
her
own
lip
,
would
be
a
shocking
mockery
,
of
which
both
she
and
I
must
always
be
conscious
,
and
which
would
degrade
her
in
her
mind
,
and
me
in
mine
,
and
each
of
us
in
the
other
's
.
<EOS>
because
if
John
Harmon
come
to
life
and
do
not
marry
her
,
the
property
fall
into
the
very
hand
that
hold
it
now

for
dead
,
he
confusedly
accept
the
aid
that
fall
upon
him
,
without
consider
how
firmly
it
must
seem
to
fix
the
Boffins
in
their
accession
to
the
fortune
.
<EOS>
when
he
see
them
,
and
know
them
,
and
even
from
his
vantage
-
ground
of
inspection
could
find
no
flaw
in
them
,
he
ask
himself
,
"
<EOS>
and
shall
I
come
to
life
to
dispossess
such
people
as
these
?
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
good
to
set
against
the
putting
of
them
to
that
hard
proof
.
<EOS>
He
have
hear
from
Bella
's
own
lip
when
he
stand
tap
at
the
door
on
that
night
of
his
take
the
lodging
,
that
the
marriage
would
have
be
on
her
part
thoroughly
mercenary
.
<EOS>
He
have
since
try
her
,
in
his
own
unknown
person
and
suppose
station
,
and
she
not
only
reject
his
advance
but
resent
them
.
<EOS>
be
it
for
him
to
have
the
shame
of
buy
her
,
or
the
meanness
of
punish
her
?
<EOS>
yet
,
by
come
to
life
and
accept
the
condition
of
the
inheritance
,
he
must
 
do
the
former
;
and
by
come
to
life
and
reject
it
,
he
must
do
the
latter
.
  
<EOS>
another
consequence
that
he
have
never
foreshadow
,
be
the
implication
of
an
innocent
man
in
his
suppose
murder
.
<EOS>
He
would
obtain
complete
retractation
from
the
accuser
,
and
set
the
wrong
right
;
but
clearly
the
wrong
could
never
have
be
do
if
he
have
never
plan
a
deception
.
<EOS>
then
,
whatever
inconvenience
or
distress
of
mind
the
deception
cost
him
,
it
be
manful
repentantly
to
accept
as
among
its
consequence
,
and
make
no
complaint
.
  
<EOS>
thus
John
Rokesmith
in
the
morning
,
and
it
bury
John
Harmon
<EOS>
still
many
fathom
deep
than
he
have
be
bury
in
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
go
out
earlier
than
he
be
accustomed
to
do
,
he
encounter
the
cherub
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
the
cherub
's
way
be
for
a
certain
space
his
way
,
and
they
walk
together
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
not
to
notice
the
change
in
the
cherub
's
appearance
.
<EOS>
the
cherub
feel
very
conscious
of
it
,
and
modestly
remark
:
"
a
present
from
my
daughter
Bella
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
word
give
the
Secretary
a
stroke
of
pleasure
,
for
he
remember
the
fifty
pound
,
and
he
still
love
the
girl
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
it
be
very
weak
---
it
always
be
very
weak
,
some
authority
hold

<EOS>
but
he
love
the
girl
.
  
<EOS>

I
do

this
long

it
do

now
that
I

alone

Johnny
go

I
would
far
sooner
be
upon

tiring
of
myself
out

a
sit
fold

fold
by

Johnny
in

his

his

mother

now
,
I
seem
to
be
a
child
myself

a
lying
once
again
in
the
arm
of
my
own
mother

then
I
get
numb
,
think
and
sense
,
till
I
start
out
of
my
seat
,
afeerd
that
I
be
a
growing
like
the
poor
old
people
that
they
brick
up
in
the
Unions
,
as
you
may
sometimes
see
when
they
let
'em
out
of
the
four
wall
to
have
a
warm
in

sun

crawl
quite
scared
about
the
street

be

nimble
girl

always

active
body

her
good

can
still

twenty
mile

put
to
it

would
far
better
be
a
walking
than
a
get
numbed

dreary
.

I
be
a
good
fair
knitter

can
make
many
little
thing

sell

<EOS>
the
loan
from
your
lady

gentleman
of
twenty
shilling
to
fit
out
a
basket
with

would
be
a
fortune
for
me

<EOS>
trudge
round
the
country

tiring
of
myself
out
,
I
shall
keep
the
deadness
off
,

get
my
own
bread
by
my
own
labour

what
more
can
I
want

stress
on
the
word

"
I

It
be
not
that
I

offence
by

say
the
old
creature
simply
,

that
I
want
to
be

piece
like

helpful
of
myself
right
through

add
the
Secretary
,
as
a
comfort
for
her

be

look
forward
to
his
opportunity

to
you
what
you

<EOS>
"
trust
him
for
that

Betty

cheerfully

"
though

have
need
to
be
something
quick
about
it

I
be
a
get
to
be
an
old
one

I
be
a
strong
one
too

weather
never

me
yet

<EOS>
now

be
so
kind

for

to
your
lady

tell
'em
what
I
ask
of
their
good
friendliness

I
ask
it

<EOS>
the
Secretary
feel
that
there

no

what

by
this
brave
old

to
Mrs.

her
to
let
Betty
Higden
have
her
way

at
all
event

"
It
would
be
far
more
satisfactory
to
your
kind
heart

I
know
,
"
he
say
,
"
to
provide
for
her

it

Mrs.
Boffin
be
not
proof
against
the

set
before

She

work

have
bring
their

clean
out

with

I
shall
have
a

<EOS>
after

discussion
it

Mrs.

summon
Bella

note
down
the
little
purchase
that
be
necessary
to
set
Betty
up
in
trade

"
<EOS>
do
not

be
timorous
for
me
,
my
dear
,
"
say
the
stanch
old
heart
,
observant
of
Bella
's
face
:
"
when
I
take
my
seat
with
my
work

clean

busy
and
fresh
,
in

country
market

place
,
I
shall
turn
a
sixpence
as
sure
as
ever
a
farmer
's
wife
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
Secretary
take
that
opportunity
of
touch
on
the
practical
question
of
Mr.
Sloppy
's
capability
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
make
a
wonderful
cabinet
-
maker
,
say
Mrs.
Higden
,
"
if
there
have
be
the
money
to
put
him
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
have
see
him
handle
tool
that
he
have
borrow
to
mend
the
mangle
,
or
to
knock
a
broken
piece
of
furniture
together
,
in
a
surprising
manner
.
<EOS>
as
to
construct
toy
for
the
Minders
,
out
of
nothing
,
he
have
do
that
daily
.
<EOS>
and
once
as
many
as
a
dozen
people
have
get
together
in
the
lane
to
see
the
neatness
with
which
he
fit
the
broken
piece
of
a
foreign
monkey
's
musical
instrument
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
well
,
"
say
the
Secretary
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
be
hard
to
find
a
trade
for
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
John
Harmon
be
bury
under
mountain
now
,
the
Secretary
that
very
same
day
set
himself
to
finish
his
affair
and
have
do
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
draw
up
an
ample
declaration
,
to
be
sign
by
Rogue
Riderhood
(
know
he
could
get
his
signature
to
it
,
by
make
him
another
and
much
short
evening
call
)
,
and
then
consider
to
whom
should
he
give
the
document
?
<EOS>
to
Hexam
's
son
,
or
daughter
?
<EOS>
resolve
speedily
,
to
the
daughter
.
<EOS>
but
it
would
be
safe
to
avoid
see
the
daughter
,
because
the
son
have
see
Julius
Handford
,
and
---
he
could
not
be
too
careful
---
there
may
possibly
be
some
comparison
of
note
between
the
son
and
daughter
,
which
would
awaken
slumber
suspicion
,
and
lead
to
consequence
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
even
,
"
he
reflect
,
"
be
apprehend
as
have
be
concern
in
my
own
murder
!
"
<EOS>
therefore
,
good
to
send
it
to
the
daughter
under
cover
by
the
post
.
<EOS>
Pleasant
Riderhood
have
undertake
to
find
out
where
she
live
,
and
it
be
not
necessary
that
it
should
be
attend
by
a
single
word
of
explanation
.
<EOS>
so
far
,
straight
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
all
that
he
know
of
the
daughter
he
derive
from
Mrs.
Boffin
's
account
of
what
she
hear
from
Mr.
Lightwood
,
who
seem
to
have
a
reputation
for
his
manner
of
relate
a
story
,
and
to
have
make
this
story
quite
his
own
.
<EOS>
It
interest
him
,
and
he
would
like
to
have
the
mean
of
know
more
---
as
,
for
instance
,
that
she
receive
the
exonerate
paper
,
and
that
it
satisfy
her
---
by
open
some
channel
altogether
independent
of
Lightwood
:
who
likewise
have
see
Julius
Handford
,
who
have
publicly
advertise
for
Julius
Handford
,
and
whom
of
all
man
he
,
the
Secretary
,
most
avoided
.
"
<EOS>
but
with
whom
the
common
course
of
thing
may
bring
me
in
a
moment
face
to
face
,
any
day
in
the
week
or
any
hour
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
now
,
to
cast
about
for
some
likely
mean
of
open
such
a
channel
.
<EOS>
the
boy
,
Hexam
,
be
train
for
and
with
a
schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
the
Secretary
know
it
,
because
his
sister
's
share
in
that
disposal
of
him
seem
to
be
the
good
part
of
Lightwood
's
account
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
this
young
fellow
,
Sloppy
,
stand
in
need
of
some
instruction
.
<EOS>
if
he
,
the
Secretary
,
engage
that
schoolmaster
to
impart
it
to
him
,
the
channel
may
be
open
.
<EOS>
the
next
point
be
,
do
Mrs.
Boffin
know
the
schoolmaster
's
name
?
<EOS>
no
,
but
she
know
where
the
school
be
.
<EOS>
quite
enough
.
<EOS>
promptly
the
Secretary
write
to
the
master
of
that
school
,
and
that
very
evening
Bradley
Headstone
answer
in
person
.
  
<EOS>
the
Secretary
state
to
the
schoolmaster
how
the
object
be
,
to
send
to
him
for
certain
occasional
evening
instruction
,
a
youth
whom
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
wish
to
help
to
an
industrious
and
useful
place
in
life
.
<EOS>
the
schoolmaster
be
willing
to
undertake
the
charge
of
such
a
pupil
.
<EOS>
the
Secretary
inquire
on
what
term
?
<EOS>
the
schoolmaster
state
on
what
term
.
<EOS>
agree
and
dispose
of
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
,
sir
,
"
say
Bradley
Headstone
,
"
to
whose
good
opinion
<EOS>
I
owe
a
recommendation
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
know
that
I
be
not
the
principal
here
.
<EOS>
I
be
Mr.
Boffin
's
Secretary
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
be
a
gentleman
who
inherit
a
property
of
which
you
may
have
hear
some
public
mention
;
the
Harmon
property
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Harmon
,
"
say
Bradley
:
who
would
have
be
a
great
deal
more
at
a
loss
than
he
be
,
if
he
have
know
to
whom
he
speak
:
"
be
murder
,
and
find
in
the
river
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
be
murder
and
find
in
the
river

"
  
"
It
be
not
---
"
  
"
no
,
"
interpose
the
Secretary
,
smile
,
"
it
be
not
he
who
recommend
you
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
hear
of
you
through
a
certain
Mr.
Lightwood
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
know
Mr.
Lightwood
,
or
know
of
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
as
much
of
him
as
I
wish
to
know
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
acquaintance
with
Mr.
Lightwood
,
and
I
desire
none
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
objection
to
Mr.
Lightwood
,
but
I
have
a
particular
objection
to
some
of
Mr.
Lightwood
's
friend
---
in
short
,
to
one
of
Mr.
Lightwood
's
friend
.
<EOS>
His
great
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
could
hardly
get
the
word
out
,
even
then
and
there
,
so
fierce
<EOS>
do
he
grow
(
though
keep
himself
down
with
infinite
pain
of
repression
)
,
when
the
careless
and
contemptuous
bearing
of
Eugene
Wrayburn
rise
before
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
the
Secretary
see
there
be
a
strong
feeling
here
on
some
sore
point
,
and
he
would
have
make
a
diversion
from
it
,
but
for
Bradley
's
holding
to
it
in
his
cumbersome
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
objection
to
mention
the
friend
by
name
,
"
he
say
,
doggedly
.
<EOS>
"
the
person
I
object
to
,
be
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn

<EOS>
the
Secretary
remember
him
.
<EOS>
in
his
disturbed
recollection
of
that
night
when
he
be
strive
against
the
drugged
drink
,
there
be
but
a
dim
image
of
Eugene
's
person
;
but
he
remember
his
name
,
and
his
manner
of
speak
,
and
how
he
have
go
with
them
to
view
the
body
,
and
where
he
have
stand
,
and
what
he
have
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
Mr.
Headstone
,
what
be
the
name

"
he
ask
,
again
try
to
make
a
diversion
,
"
of
young
Hexam
's
sister
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Her
name
be
Lizzie
,
"

the
schoolmaster
,
with
a
strong
contraction
of
his
whole
face

<EOS>
"
She
be
a
young
woman
of
a
remarkable
character

be
she
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
sufficiently
remarkable
to
be
very
superior
to
Mr.

Wrayburn

though
an
ordinary
person
may
be
that

"
say
the
schoolmaster
;
"
and
I
hope
you
will
not
think
it
impertinent
in
me
,
sir

to
ask
why
you
put

two
name
together

"
  
"
by
mere
accident

return
the
Secretary

<EOS>
"
observe
that
Mr.

a
disagreeable
subject

away

no

certainly
not

"
I
take
the
liberty

ask

Bradley

after
cast
his
eye
on
the
ground

he
be
capable
of
make
any
representation

in
the
swaggering
levity
of
his
insolence

I
<EOS>

I
hope
you
will
not
misunderstand
me
,
sir

<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
be
much
interested
in
this
brother

sister
,
and
the
subject
awaken
very
strong
feeling
within
me
.
<EOS>
very
,
very
,
strong
feeling
.

"
<EOS>
with
a
shake
hand
,
Bradley
take
out
his
handkerchief
and
wipe
his
brow
.
  
<EOS>
the
Secretary
think
,
as
he
glance
at
the
schoolmaster
's
face
,
that
he
have
open
a
channel
here
indeed
,
and
that
it
be
an
unexpectedly
dark
and
deep
and
stormy
one
,
and
difficult
to
sound
.
<EOS>
all
at
once
,
in
the
midst
of
his
turbulent
emotion
,
Bradley
stop
and
seem
to
challenge
his
look
.
<EOS>
much
as
though
he
suddenly
ask
him
,
"
what
do
you
see
in
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
brother
,
young
Hexam
,
be
your
real
recommendation
here

"
 
say
the
Secretary

quietly
go
back
to
the
point
;
"
Mr.

your
pupil

anything
that
I
ask
respect
the
brother

either
of

I
ask
for
myself

<EOS>
very
lately

the

find

mysteriously
receive

she
know
not

an
explicit
retractation
of

charge
make
against
her
father

by
another
water

side
character

Riderhood

nobody
believe
them

tempt

the

abandon

however

the

have
mention
find
its

into
Lizzie

with
a
general
flavour
on

favour
by
some
anonymous

be
by

You
will
excuse
the
phraseology

as
I
never

I

instead

answer
hastily

vexedly
:

<EOS>
no

no

no

the

not

with

the
vanishing

the
vanishing

therefore
veneer

recal
the

sheep

the
pen
from

stray

who
so
fit
to
discourse

happiness
of
Mr.

they
be
the
dear

he
have

what
audience
so
fit

him
to
take
into
his
confidence

signify
many

so
veneer

without
the
formality
of
rise

launch
into
a
familiar
oration

gradually
tone
into
the
Parliamentary
sing

song
,
in
which
he
see
at
that
board
his
dear
friend
Twemlow
who
on
that
day
twelvemonth
bestow
on
his
dear
friend
Lammle
the
fair

of
his

also
see
at

rallying
round
him
at

period
when
his

likewise
rally
round

ay

in
the
foremost
rank

he
can
never

he
be
free

confess

he

from

his

his

for

many
more
which
he

well
know
will
have
occur
to

exceptional
acuteness

he
be
here
to
submit
to
you
that
the
time
have
arrive

,
with
our
heart
in

glass
,
with
tear
in
our
eye
,
with
blessing
on

in

one

many
many
friend
as
congenially
 
united
as
themselves

<EOS>
and
this
he
will
add
;
that
Anastatia
Veneering
(
who
be
instantly
hear
to
weep
)
be
form
on
the
same
model
as
her
old
and
choose
friend
Sophronia
Lammle
,
in
respect
that
she
be
devoted
to
the
man
who
woo
and
win
her
,
and
nobly
discharge
the
duty
of
a
wife
.
  
<EOS>
see
no
well
way
out
of
it
,
veneer
here
pull
up
his
oratorical
Pegasus
extremely
short
,
and
plump
down
,
clean
over
his
head
,
with
:
"
Lammle
,
God
bless
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
then
Lammle
.
<EOS>
too
much
of
him
every
way
;
pervadingly
too
much
nose
of
a
coarse
wrong
shape
,
and
his
nose
in
his
mind
and
his
manner
;
too
much
smile
to
be
real
;
too
much
frown
to
be
false
;
 
too
many
large
tooth
to
be
visible
at
once
without
suggest
a
bite
.
<EOS>
He
thank
you
,
dear
friend
,
for
your
kindly
greeting
,
and
hope
to
receive
you
---
it
may
be
on
the
next
of
these
delightful
occasion
---
in
a
residence
better
suited
to
your
claim
on
the
rite
of
hospitality
.
<EOS>
He
will
never
forget
that
at
Veneering
's
he
first
see
Sophronia
.
<EOS>
Sophronia
will
never
forget
that
at
Veneering
's
she
first
see
him
.
<EOS>
They
speak
of
it
soon
after
they
be
married
,
and
agree
that
they
would
never
forget
it
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
to
veneer
they
owe
their
union
.
<EOS>
They
hope
to
show
their
sense
of
this
some
day
(
"
no
,
no
,
"
from
Veneering
)
---
<EOS>
oh
yes
,
yes
,
and
let
him
rely
upon
it
,
they
will
if
they
can
!
<EOS>
His
marriage
with
Sophronia
be
not
a
marriage
of
interest
on
either
side
:
she
have
her
little
fortune
,
he
have
his
little
fortune
:
they
join
their
little
fortune
:
it
be
a
marriage
of
pure
inclination
and
suitability
.
<EOS>
thank
you
!
<EOS>
Sophronia
and
<EOS>
he
be
fond
of
the
society
of
young
people
;
but
he
be
not
sure
that
their
house
would
be
a
good
house
for
young
people
propose
to
remain
single
,
since
the
contemplation
of
its
domestic
bliss
may
induce
them
to
change
their
mind
.
<EOS>
He
will
not
apply
this
to
any
one
present
;
certainly
not
to
their
darling
little
Georgiana
.
<EOS>
again
thank
you
!
<EOS>
neither
,
by
-
the
-
by

will
he
apply
it
to
his
friend
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
He
thank
veneer
for
the
feeling
manner
in
which
he
refer
to
their
common
friend
Fledgeby

that

<EOS>
thank
you

<EOS>
in
fact
(
return
uexpectedly

Fledgeby

the
well
you
know
him

the
more
you
find
in
him
that
you

know

again

that

Miss

She

down

I

<EOS>
after
this
preliminary
,
Miss

read
the
document

,
as
often
as
she
raise
her
eyebrow
in

do
,
the
watchful
Miss
Jenny
accompany
the
action
with
an
expressive
and
emphatic
sip

the
shrub

water

<EOS>
"
as
far
as
this
go
,
"
say
Miss

Potterson
,
when
she
have
read
it
several
time
,
and
think
about
it
,
"
it
prove
(
what
do
not
much
need
prove
)
that
Rogue
Riderhood
be
a
villain
.
<EOS>
I
have
my
doubt
whether
he
be
not
the
villain
who
solely
do
the
deed
;
but
I
have
no
expectation
of
those
doubt
ever
be
clear
up
now
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
do
Lizzie
's
father
wrong
,
but
never
Lizzie
's
self
;
because
when
thing
be
at
the
bad
I
trust
her
,
have
perfect
confidence
in
her
,
and
try
to
persuade
her
to
come
to
me
for
a
refuge
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
sorry
to
have
do
a
man
wrong
,
particularly
when
it
can
not
be
undo
.
<EOS>
be
kind
enough
to
let
Lizzie
know
what
I
say
;
not
forget
that
if
she
will
come
to
the
Porters
,
after
all
,
bygone
be
bygone
,
she
will
find
a
home
at
the
Porters

and
a
friend
at
the
Porters

<EOS>
She
know
Miss

of
old

remind
her
,
and
she
know
what

like
the
home
,
and
what

like
the
friend

be
likely
to
turn
out
.
<EOS>
I
be
generally
short

sweet

accord

it
may
be

Miss

that
be
about
all
I
have
get
to

enough
too

"
  
<EOS>
but
before
the
shrub

be
sip
out

Miss

bethink
herself
that

It

you

jot
it
down

It
be
something

new

see
her

find
any

very
willing

tolerate
his

not

pressingly

soothingly
entreat
him
to
belong

sensation
she

hazy
idea

thus
for
a
long

it
would
be
a
respectable
change

float
in
her
mind

<EOS>
also
some
vague
idea
that
the
old
evil
be
drown
out
of
him
,
and
that
if
he
should
happily
come
back
to
resume
his
occupation
of
the
empty
form
that
lie
upon

,
his

will

<EOS>
in

state

<EOS>
she
kiss

and

<EOS>
the

discontent
growl

He

all
the
spectator

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
Mr.

a
hundred
more

see
of
theirs

but
they
still
celebrate
the
occasion
in
the
bosom
of
their
family

<EOS>
not

<EOS>
It
be

lurid
indication

fitfully

<EOS>
It
be
not
impossible
that

modest
penitence

the
length
of
sometimes
severely
reprove
him
for
that

take
the
liberty
of

so
exalt
a

<EOS>
as
for
the
child
of
the

their
experience
of

either
that
Ma

put

the
inquired

a
man

be
bind

consider
the

price

at
first
I
do
not
enter

as
much

I
may
have
do

I
have
get
acquaint
with
other
man
of
property
since
,

I
have
get
acquaint
with
the
duty
of
property
.
<EOS>
I
must
not
go
put
the
market
-
price
up
,

money
may
happen
not

object
with
me
.
<EOS>
a
sheep
be
worth
so
much
in

market

I
ought

rather

lately

perhaps
it

now

there
be

somehow
,
when

derive

then
pray
,
"
say
Bella
,
sternly
put
the
question
to
herself
in
the
looking
-
glass
as
usual
,
"
what
do
you
mean
by
this
,
you
inconsistent
little
Beast

<EOS>
the
looking

glass
preserve
a
discreet
ministerial
silence
<EOS>
when
thus
call
upon
for
explanation
,
Bella
go
to
bed
with
a
weariness
upon
her
spirit
which
be
more
than
the
weariness
of
want
of
sleep
.
<EOS>
and
again
in
the
morning
,
she
look
for
the
cloud
,
and
for
the
deepening
of
the
cloud
,
upon
the
Golden
Dustman
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
begin
by
this
time
to
be
his
frequent
companion
in
his
morning
stroll
about
the
street
,
and
it
be
at
this
time
that
he
make
her
a
party
to
his
engaging
in
a
curious
pursuit
.
<EOS>
have
be
hard
at
work
in
one
dull
enclosure
all
his
life

he
have
a
child
's
delight
in
look
at
shop

<EOS>
It
have
be
one
of
the
first
novelty
and
pleasure
of
his
freedom
,
and
be
equally
the
delight
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
for
many
year
their
only
walk
in
London
have
be
take
on
sunday
when
the
shop
be
shut
;
and
when
every
day
in
the
week
become
their
holiday
,
they
derive
an
enjoyment
from
the
variety
and
fancy
and
beauty
of
the
display
in
the
window
,
which
seem
incapable
of
exhaustion
.
<EOS>
as
if
the
principal
street
be
a
great
Theatre
and
the
play
be
childishly
new
to
them
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
,
from
the
beginning
of
Bella
's
intimacy
in
their
house
,
have
be
constantly
in
the
front
row
,
charm
with
all
they
see
and
applaud
vigorously
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
Mr.
Boffin
's
interest
begin
to
centre
in
book
-
shop
;
and
more
than
that
---
for
that
of
itself
would
not
have
be
much
---
in
one
exceptional
kind
of
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
look
in
here
,
my
dear
,
"
Mr.
Boffin
would
say
,
check
Bella
's
arm
at
a
bookseller
's
window
;
"
you
can
read
at
sight
,
and
your
eye
be
as
sharp
as
they
be
bright
.
<EOS>
now
,
look
well
about
you
,
my
dear
,
and
tell
me
if
you
see
any
book
about
a
Miser
.
"
  
<EOS>
if
Bella
see
such
a
book
,
Mr.
Boffin
would
instantly
dart
in
and
buy
it
.
<EOS>
and
still
,
as
if
they
have
not
find
it
,
they
would
seek
out
another
book
-
shop
,
and
Mr.
Boffin
would
say
,
"
now
,
look
well
all
round
,
my
dear
,
for
a
life
of
a
Miser
,
or
any
book
of
that
sort
;
any
life
of
odd
character
who
may
have
be
miser
.
"
  
<EOS>
bella
,
thus
direct
,
would
examine
the
window
with
the
great
attention
,
while
Mr.
Boffin
would
examine
her
face
.
<EOS>
the
moment
she
point
out
any
book
as
be
entitle
life
of
eccentric
personage
,
Anecdotes
of
strange
character
,
Records
of
remarkable
individual
,
or
anything
to
that
purpose
,
Mr.
Boffin
's
countenance
would
light
up
,
and
he
would
instantly
dart
in
and
buy
it
.
<EOS>
size
,
price
,
quality
,
be
of
no
account
.
<EOS>
any
book
that
seem
to
promise
a
chance
of
miserly
biography
,
Mr.
Boffin
purchase
without
a
moment
's
delay
and
carry
home
.
<EOS>
happen
to
be
inform
by
a
bookseller
that
a
portion
of
the
Annual
Register
be
devoted
to
"
character
,
"
Mr.
Boffin
at
once
buy
a
whole
set
of
that
ingenious
compilation
,
and
begin
to
carry
it
home
piecemeal
,
confide
a
volume
to
Bella
,
and
bear
three
himself
.
<EOS>
the
completion
of
his
labour
occupy
them
about
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
when
the
task
be
do
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
his
appetite
for
miser
whet
instead
of
satiate
,
begin
to
look
out
again
.
  
<EOS>
It
very
soon
become
unnecessary
to
tell
Bella
what
to
look
for
,
and
an
understanding
be
establish
between
her
and
Mr.
Boffin
that
she
be
always
to
look
for
life
of
miser
.
<EOS>
morning
after
morning
they
roam
about
the
town
together
,
pursue
this
singular
research
.
<EOS>
miserly
literature
not
be
abundant
,
the
proportion
of
failure
to
success
may
have
be
as
a
hundred
to
one
;
still
Mr.
Boffin
,
never
weary
,
remain
as
avaricious
for
miser
as
he
have
be
at
the
first
onset
.
<EOS>
It
be
curious
that
Bella
never
see
the
book
about
the
house
,
nor
do
she
ever
hear
from
Mr.
Boffin
one
word
of
reference
to
their
content
.
<EOS>
he
seem
to
save
up
his
Misers
as
they
have
save
up
their
money
.
<EOS>
as
they
have
be
greedy
for
it
,
and
secret
about
it
,
and
have
hide
it
,
so
he
be
greedy
for
them
,
and
secret
about
them
,
and
hide
them
.
<EOS>
but
beyond
all
doubt
it
be
to
be
notice
,
and
be
by
Bella
very
clearly
notice
,
that
,
as
he
pursue
the
acquisition
of
those
dismal
record
with
the
ardour
of
Don
Quixote
for
his
book
of
chivalry
,
he
begin
to
spend
his
money
with
a
more
sparing
hand
.
<EOS>
and
often
when
he
come
out
of
a
shop
with
some
new
account
of
one
of
those
wretched
lunatic
,
she
would
almost
shrink
from
the
sly
dry
chuckle
with
which
he
would
take
her
arm
again
and
trot
away
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
appear
that
Mrs.
Boffin
know
of
this
taste
.
<EOS>
He
make
no
allusion
to
it
,
except
in
the
morning
walk
when
he
and
Bella
be
always
alone
;
and
Bella
,
partly
under
the
impression
that
he
take
her
into
his
confidence
by
implication
,
and
partly
in
remembrance
of
Mrs.
Boffin
's
anxious
face
that
night
,
hold
the
same
reserve
.
  
<EOS>
while
these
occurrence
be
in
progress
,
Mrs.
Lammle
make
the
discovery
that
Bella
have
a
fascinating
influence
over
her
.
<EOS>
the
Lammles
,
originally
present
by
the
dear
Veneerings
,
visit
the
Boffins
on
all
grand
occasion
,
and
Mrs.
Lammle
have
not
previously
find
this
out
;
but
now
the
knowledge
come
upon
her
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
most
extraordinary
thing
(
shed
say
to
Mrs.
Boffin
)
;
she
be
foolishly
susceptible
of
the
power
of
beauty
,
but
it
be
not
altogether
that
;
she
never
have
be
able
to
resist
a
natural
grace
of
manner
,
but
it
be
not
altogether
that
;
it
be
more
than
that
,
and
there
be
no
name
for
the
indescribable
extent
and
degree
to
which
she
be
captivate
by
this
charming
girl
.
  
<EOS>
this
charming
girl
have
the
word
repeat
to
her
by
Mrs.
Boffin
(
who
be
proud
of
her
be
admire
,
and
would
have
do
anything
to
give
her
pleasure
)
,
naturally
recognize
in
Mrs.
Lammle
a
woman
of
penetration
and
taste
.
<EOS>
respond
to
the
sentiment
,
by
be
very
gracious
to
Mrs.
Lammle
,
she
give
that
lady
the
mean
of
so
improve
her
opportunity
,
as
that
the
captivation
become
reciprocal
,
though
always
wear
an
appearance
of
great
sobriety
on
Bella
's
part
than
on
the
enthusiastic
Sophronia
's
.
<EOS>
Howbeit
,
they
be
so
much
together
that
,
for
a
time
,
the
Boffin
chariot
hold
Mrs.
Lammle
oftener
than
Mrs.
Boffin
:
a
preference
of
which
the
latter
worthy
soul
be
not
in
the
least
jealous
,
placidly
remark
,
"
Mrs.
Lammle
be
a
young
companion
for
her
than
I
be
,
and
<EOS>
Lor
!
<EOS>
she
be
more
fashionable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
between
Bella
Wilfer
and
Georgiana
Podsnap
there
be
this
one
difference
,
among
many
other
,
that
Bella
be
in
no
danger
of
be
captivate
by
Alfred
.
<EOS>
She
distrust
and
dislike
him
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
her
perception
be
so
quick
,
and
her
observation
so
sharp
,
that
after
all
she
mistrust
his
wife
too
,
though
with
her
giddy
vanity
and
wilfulness
she
squeeze
the
mistrust
away
into
a
corner
of
her
mind
,
and
block
it
up
there
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
take
the
friendly
interest
in
Bella
's
make
a
good
match
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
say
,
in
a
sportive
way
,
she
really
must
show
her
beautiful
Bella
what
kind
of
wealthy
creature
she
and
Alfred
have
on
hand
,
who
would
as
one
man
fall
at
her
foot
enslave
.
<EOS>
fitting
occasion
make
,
Mrs.
Lammle
accordingly
produce
the
most
passable
of
those
feverish
,
boastful
,
and
indefinably
loose
gentleman
who

three

<EOS>
who
in
their
agreeable
manner
do
homage
to
Bella
as

she
be

compound
of
fine
girl
,
thorough

breed

well

<EOS>
but
without
the

<EOS>
"

you

Mrs.

look

her
good

You

now

the
very
grossness
of
this
flattery
put
Bella
upon

actually
do

in

She
have
a
misgiving
that

though
she
have
an
indistinct

<EOS>
"
the

Mrs.

with
a
kind
of
resignation

<EOS>
"
He
appear
to

return
Bella
,
toss
her
head

and
he
have
plenty
to
say
for
himself
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
my
opinion
of
his
declaration

his
conduct
,
and
dismiss
him

<EOS>
of
course
this
have
all
be
very
inconvenient

very
disagreeable

<EOS>
It
have
remain
a

however

that
word
remind
me

"
  
<EOS>
this
time
Sophronia
be
so
much
in

that
she
find
it
necessary
to
bend
forward
in
the
carriage
and
give
Bella
a
kiss
.
<EOS>
a
Judas
order
of
kiss
;
for
she
think
,
while
she
yet
press

after
give
it
,
"
upon
your

you
vain
heartless

puff
up

folly

I

have
no

if
my

I

certainly
not

him
again

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
those
very
same
moment
,
Bella
be
think
,
"
why
be
I
always
at
war
with
myself
?
<EOS>
why
have
I
tell
,
as
if
upon

what
I
know
all
along
I
ought
to
have
withhold
?
<EOS>
why
be
I
make
a
friend
of
this
woman
beside
me
,
in
spite
of
the
whisper
against
her
that
I
hear
in
my
heart
?
"
  
<EOS>
as
usual
,
there
be
no
answer
in
the
looking
-
glass
when
she
get
home
and
refer
these
question
to
it
.
<EOS>
perhaps
if
she
have
consult
some
well
oracle
,
the
result
may
have
be
more
satisfactory
;
but
she
do
not
,
and
all
thing
consequent
march
the
march
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
on
one
point
connect
with
the
watch
she
keep
on
Mr.
Boffin
,
she
feel
very
inquisitive
,
and
that
be
the
question
whether
the
Secretary
watch
him
too
,
and
follow
the
sure
and
steady
change
in
him
,
as
she
do
?
<EOS>
Her
very
limited
intercourse
with
Mr.
Rokesmith
render
this
hard
to
find
out
.
<EOS>
Their
communication
now
,
at
no
time
extend
beyond
the
preservation
of
commonplace
appearance
before
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
;
and
if
Bella
and
the
Secretary
be
ever
leave
alone
together
by
any
chance
,
he
immediately
withdraw
.
<EOS>
She
consult
his
face
when
she
could
do
so
covertly
,
as
she
work
or
read
,
and
could
make
nothing
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
look
subdued
;
but
he
have
acquire
a
strong
command
of
feature
,
and
,
whenever
Mr.
Boffin
speak
to
him
in
Bella
's
presence
,
or
whatever
revelation
of
himself
Mr.
Boffin
make
,
the
Secretary
's
face
change
no
more
than
a
wall
.
<EOS>
a
slightly
knit
brow
,
that
express
nothing
but
an
almost
mechanical
attention
,
and
a
compression
of
the
mouth
,
that
may
have
be
a
guard
against
a
scornful
smile
---
these
she
see
from
morning
to
night
,
from
day
to
day
,
from
week
to
week
,
monotonous
,
unvarying
,
set
,
as
in
a
piece
of
sculpture
.
  
<EOS>
the
bad
of
the
matter
be
,
that
it
thus
fall
out
insensibly
---
and
most
provokingly
,
as
Bella
complain
to
herself
,
in
her
impetuous
little
manner
---
that
her
observation
of
Mr.
Boffin
involve
a
continual
observation
of
Mr.
Rokesmith
.
"
<EOS>
will
not
that
extract
a
look
from
him
?
"
<EOS>
---
"
Can
it
be
possible
that
make
no
impression
on
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
such
question
Bella
would
propose
to
herself
,
often
as
many
time
in
a
day
as
there
be
hour
in
it
.
<EOS>
impossible
to
know
.
<EOS>
always
the
same
fixed
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
he
be
so
base
as
to
sell
his
very
nature
for
two
hundred
a
year
?
<EOS>
"
Bella
would
think
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
"
but
why
not
?
<EOS>
It
be
a
mere
question
of
price
with
other
besides
him
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
would
sell
mine
,
if
I
could
get
enough
for
it
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
she
would
come
round
again
to
the
war
with
herself
.
  
<EOS>
a
kind
of
illegibility
,
though
a
different
kind
,
steal
over
Mr.
Boffin
's
face
.
<EOS>
Its
old
simplicity
of
expression
get
mask
by
a
certain
craftiness
that
assimilate
even
his
good
-
humour
to
itself
.
<EOS>
His
very
smile
be
cunning
,
as
if
he
have
be
study
smile
among
the
portrait
of
his
miser
.
<EOS>
save
an
occasional
burst
of
impatience
,
or
coarse
assertion
of
his
mastery
,
his
good
-
humour
remain
to
him
,
but
it
have
now
a
sordid
alloy
of
distrust
;
and
though
his
eye
should
twinkle
and
all
his
face
should
laugh
,
he
would
sit
hold
himself
in
his
own
arm
,
as
if
he
have
an
inclination
to
hoard
himself
up
,
and
must
always
grudgingly
stand
on
the
defensive
.
  
<EOS>
what
with
take
heed
of
these
two
face
,
and
what
with
feel
conscious
that
the
stealthy
occupation
must
set
some
mark
on
her
own
,
Bella
soon
begin
to
think
that
there
be
not
a
candid
or
a
natural
face
among
them
all
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Boffin
's
.
<EOS>
none
the
less
because
it
be
far
less
radiant
than
of
yore
,
faithfully
reflect
in
its
anxiety
and
regret
every
line
of
change
in
the
Golden
Dustman
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rokesmith
,
"
say
Mr.
Boffin
one
evening
when
they
be
all
in
his
room
again
,
and
he
and
the
Secretary
have
be
go
over
some
account
,
"
I
be
spend
too
much
money
.
<EOS>
or

,
you

too
much

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
rich

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not

"
say
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
the
sharpness
of
the
retort
be
next
to
tell
the
Secretary
that
he
lie
.
<EOS>
but
it
bring
no
change
of
expression
into
the
set
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you

Mr.
Boffin

repeat
the

in
measure
word

<EOS>

well

Mr.
Boffin
,
"
if
I
be

that
be
my

I

not

even

I

most

1782

make
his

devise
the
land
now
in

to
the
child
of
his
young
son
;
soon
after
which
his
faculty
fail
him

become
altogether
childish
and
die
,
above
eighty
year
old

immediately
afterwards

after
twenty

one
year

wife

,
and
he
very
soon
afterwards
,
at
the
age
of
seventy
-
eight
,
marry
a
very
young
woman
:
which
cause
some
anxiety
to
his
two
son

whose
poignant
expression
of
this

so
exasperate
their

that
he
in
his

execute
a

to
disinherit
his
eld
son
,
and
in
his
fit
of
anger
show
it
to
his
second
son
,
who
instantly
determine
to
get
at

and

Wegg
look
intelligently
thoughtful

that
have
not

now
bring

to
bear
on

He
have

the
instant

Wegg
clutch

say
in

him
with

stand
interlock

preposterous
gladiator

<EOS>
"
there
be
no
time
to
tell

I

he
must

go
to
look

<EOS>
We
must
have
an
eye
upon
him
instantly

"
  
<EOS>
release
each
other
,
they
creep
to
the
door
,
open
it
softly
,
and
peep
out
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
cloudy
night
,
and
the
black
shadow
of
the
Mounds
make
the
dark
yard
darker
.
<EOS>
"
if
not
a
double
swindler
,
"
 
whisper
Wegg
,
"
why
a
dark
lantern

We
could
have
see
what

<EOS>
but
he
do
turn
it
on
,
almost
in
that
same
instant
,
and
flash
its
light
upon
the
first
of
the
Mounds

<EOS>
"
be

discreet
advice
too

for
he
darken
his
lantern
again
,
and
the
mound
turn
black
.
<EOS>
after
a
few
second
,
he
turn
the
light
on
once
more
,
and
be
see
stand
at
the
foot

up

so
that

may
make
no

Mr.

in
order

his
refractory
leg
may

They
could
just
make
out

instantly

so
he
think
;

he
be
use

call
this
his

because
it

the
one
first
leave
to

the
one

He

gain
the
top
of

on
his
light

only
partially

a

many

<EOS>
hard
by

light
a
few
foot
of
the
low
part
of
it

a
little
of
the
ashy
surface
around

and
then
cast
off
a
purposeless
little
clear
trail
of
light
into
the

<EOS>
"
He
can
never

up
the
pole

"
<EOS>
whisper
Venus
as
they
drop
low
and
keep
close

<EOS>
"
perhaps
it
be
holler
and

bent
over

and
take
out
what

so
he
lock
up
the
Bower

they
set
forth
:
<EOS>
Mr.

take
his
arm

keep
it

They
find

key

again

they
be
within

not
before
he
have
put
up

bar
the
shutter

<EOS>
"
no

he
then

so
he
rake
together
the

warm
cinder
in

rusty
grate

make
a
fire

trim
the
candle

as
the
fire
cast
its

Silas
take
his

in

wooden

his

inwardly
approve

they
may
end
in
Mr.

<EOS>
with
still
reluctant

not
without
several
glance
towards
the
skeleton
hand
,
as
if
he
mistrust
that
a
couple
of

spring
forth

Wegg
open
the

open

He
hold

take
hold
of
another

searchingly

attentively

evident
parallel
in

be
evidently
make
,
inasmuch
as
they
have
but
to
put
their
price
upon
this
document
,
and
get
that
price
from
the
minion
of
fortune
and
the
worm
of
the
hour
:
who
now
appear
to
be
less
of
a
minion
and
more
of
a
worm
than
have
be
previously
suppose
.
<EOS>
that
,
he
consider
it
plain
that
such
price
be
stateable
in
a
single
expressive
word
,
and
that
the
word
be
,
"
halve
!
"
<EOS>
that
,
the
question
then
arise
when
"
halve
!
"
should
be
call
.
<EOS>
that
,
here
he
have
a
plan
of
action
to
recommend
,
with
a
conditional
clause
.
<EOS>
that
,
the
plan
of
action
be
that
they
should
lie
by
with
patience
;
 
that
,
they
should
allow
the
Mounds
to
be
gradually
level
and
clear
away
,
while
retain
to
themselves
their
present
opportunity
of
watch
the
process
---
which
would
be
,
he
conceive
,
to
put
the
trouble
and
cost
of
daily
digging
and
delve
upon
somebody
else
,
while
they
may
nightly
turn
such
complete
disturbance
of
the
dust
to
the
account
of
their
own
private
investigation
---
and
that
,
when
the
Mounds
be
go
,
and
they
have
work
those
chance
for
their
own
joint
benefit
solely
,
they
should
then
,
and
not
before
,
explode
on
the
minion
and
worm
.
<EOS>
but
here
come
the
conditional
clause
,
and
to
this
he
entreat
the
special
attention
of
his
comrade
,
brother
,
and
partner
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
bear
that
the
minion
and
worm
should
carry
off
any
of
that
property
which
be
now
to
be
regard
as
their
own
property
.
<EOS>
when
he
,
Mr.
Wegg
,
have
see
the
minion
surreptitiously
make
off
with
that
bottle
,
and
its
precious
content
unknown
,
he
have
look
upon
him
in
the
light
of
a
mere
robber
,
and
,
as
such
,
would
have
despoil
him
of
his
ill
-
get
gain
,
but
for
the
judicious
interference
of
his
comrade
,
brother
,
and
partner
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
the
conditional
clause
he
propose
be
,
that
,
if
the
minion
should
return
in
his
late
sneak
manner
,
and
if
,
be
closely
watch
,
he
should
be
find
to
possess
himself
of
anything
,
no
matter
what
,
the
sharp
sword
impend
over
his
head
should
be
instantly
show
him
,
he
should
be
strictly
examine
as
to
what
he
know
or
suspect
,
should
be
severely
handle
by
them
his
master
,
and
should
be
keep
in
a
state
of
abject
moral
bondage
and
slavery
until
the
time
when
they
should
see
fit
to
permit
him
to
purchase
his
freedom
at
the
price
of
half
his
possession
.
<EOS>
if
say
Mr.
Wegg
by
way
of
peroration
,
he
have
err
in
say
only
"
half
!
"
<EOS>
he
trust
to
his
comrade
,
brother
,
and
partner
not
to
hesitate
to
set
him
right
,
and
to
reprove
his
weakness
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
more
accord
to
the
right
of
thing
,
to
say
Twothirds
;
 
it
may
be
more
accord
to
the
right
of
thing
,
to
say
three
-
fourth
.
<EOS>
on
those
point
he
be
ever
open
to
correction
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.

,
have
waft
his

to
this
discourse
over

It

<EOS>
the

She

<EOS>
in
the
pleasant
town

Chertsey

Walton

Kingston

Staines
,
her
figure
come
to
be
quite
well
known
for
some
short
week
,
and
then
again
pass
on
.
  
<EOS>
She
would
take
her
stand
in
market
-
place
,
where
there
be
such
thing
,
on
market
day
;
at
other
time
,
in
the
busy
(
that
be
seldom
very
busy
)
portion
of
the
little
quiet
High
Street
;
at
still
other
time
she
would
explore
the
outlying
road
for
great
house
,
and
would
ask
leave
at
the
Lodge
to
pass
in
with
her
basket
,
and
would
not
often
get
it
.
<EOS>
but
lady

frequently
make
purchase
from

trifle
stock

be
usually
pleased
with
her
bright
eye

her

<EOS>
in
these
and
her
clean

originate
a
fable
that
she
be
well

one
may

,
for
her
station
,
rich
.
<EOS>
as
make

this
class
of
fable
have
long
be
popular

<EOS>
in
those
pleasant
little
town
on
Thames
,
you
may
hear
the
fall
of
the
water
over
the
weir
,
or
even
,
in
still
weather
,
the
rustle
of
the
rush
;
and
from
the
bridge
you
may
see
the
the
young
river
,
dimple
like
a
young
child
,
playfully
glide
away
among
the
tree
,
unpollute
by
the
defilement
that
lie
in
wait
for

on
its
course
,
and
as
yet
out
of
hearing
of
the
deep
summon
of
the
sea
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
much
to
pretend
that
Betty
Higden
make
out
such
thought
;
no
;
 
but
she
hear
the
tender
river
whisper
to
many
like

,
"

I

<EOS>
My

be

death

<EOS>
come
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
abundant
place
for
gentle
fancy
too
,
in
her
untutored
mind
.
<EOS>
those
gentlefolk
and
their
child
inside
those
fine
house
,
could
they
think
,
as
they
look
out
at
her
,
what
it
be
to
be
really
hungry
,
really
cold
?
<EOS>
do
they
feel
any
of
the
wonder
about
her
,
that
she
feel
about
them
?
<EOS>
bless
the
dear
laugh
child
!
<EOS>
if
they
could
have
see
sick
Johnny
in

would
they

<EOS>
if
they

dead
Johnny
on

would

<EOS>
bless

<EOS>
so
with
the
humbler
house
in
the
little
street
,
the
inner
firelight
shine
on
the
pane
as
the
outer
twilight
darken

<EOS>
when
the
family
gather
in

door
there
,
for
the
night
,
it
be
only
a
foolish
fancy
to
feel
as
if
it
be
a
little
hard
in
them
to
close
the
shutter
and
blacken
the
flame
.
<EOS>
so
with
the
light
shop
,
and
speculation
whether
their
master
and
mistress
take
tea
in
a
perspective
of
back
-
parlour
---
not
so
far
within
but
that
the
flavour
of
tea
and
toast
come
out
,
mingle
with
the
glow
of
light
,
into
the
street
---
ate
or
drank
or
wear
what
they
sell
,
with
the
great
relish
because
they
deal
in
it

<EOS>
so
with
the
churchyard
on
a
branch
of
the
solitary

to

night

"
ah

and
I

have
it
pretty

so
much
the

"
<EOS>
the
poor
soul
envy
no
one
in
bitterness
,
and
grudge
no
one
anything
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
the
old
abhorrence
grow
strong
on
her
as
she
grow
weak
,
and
it
find
more
sustain
food
than
she
do
in
her
wandering
.
<EOS>
now
,
she
would
light
upon
the
shameful
spectacle
of
some
desolate
creature
---
or
some
wretche
ragged
group
of
either
sex
,
or
of
both
sex
,
with
child
among
them
,
huddle
together
like
the
small
vermin
for
a
little
warmth
---
linger
and
linger
on
a
doorstep
,
while
the
appoint
evader
of
the
public
trust
do
his
dirty
office
of
try
to
weary
them
out
and
so
get
rid
of
them
.
<EOS>
now
,
she
would
light
upon
some
poor
decent
person
,
like
herself
,
go
afoot
on
a
pilgrimage
of
many
weary
mile
to
see
some
wear
-
out
relative
or
friend
who
have
be
charitably
clutch
off
to
a
great
blank
barren
Union
House
,
as
far
from
old
home
as
the
County
Jail

remoteness

which
be
always
its
bad
punishment
for
small
rural
offender
)
,
and
in
its
dietary
,
and
in
its
lodging
,
and
in
its
tending
of
the
sick
,
a
much
more
penal
establishment
.
<EOS>
sometimes
she
would
hear
a
newspaper
read
out
,
and
would
learn
how
the
Registrar
General
cast
up
the
unit
that
have
within
the
last
week
die
of
want
and
of
exposure
to
the
weather
:
for
which
that
Recording
Angel
seem
to
have
a
regular
fixed
place
in
his
sum
,
as
if
they
be
its
halfpence
.
<EOS>
all
such
thing
she
would
hear
discuss
,
as
we
,
my
lord
and
gentleman
and
honorable
board
,
in
our
unapproachable
magnificence
never
hear
them
,
and
from
all
such
thing
she
would
fly
with
the
wing
of
rage
despair
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
not
to

receive
as
a
figure
of
speech
.
<EOS>
Old
Betty
Higden
however
tired
,
however
footsore
,
would
start
up
and
be
drive
away
by
her
awakened
horror
of
fall
into
the
hand
of
Charity
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
remarkable
christian
improvement
,
to
have
make
a
pursue
fury
of
the
Good
Samaritan

but
it
be
so
in
this
case

and
it
be
a
type
of
many

many

many

<EOS>
two
incident
unite
to
intensify
the
old
unreasone
abhorrence

grant
in

to

unreasone

because
the

always
be
unreasone

invariably
make

the
sign
of

hang
across
the

after

by
a
turn

so
read
the

Frank

in

voice

for
his
heart
misgave
him
that
all
be
not
quite
right
between
us
and
our
sister
---
or
say
our
sister
in
Law
---
Poor
Law

and
that
we
sometimes
read
these
word
in
an
awful
manner
,
over
our
Sister

our
brother
too

and
Sloppy

the

Sloppy
could
not

the
hearty
thank
require

<EOS>
selfish
in
Sloppy
,

excusable
,
it
may
be
humbly
hope
,
because
our
sister
have
be
more
than
his
mother

<EOS>
the
word
be
read
above
the
ashe
of
Betty
Higden
,
in
a
corner
of
a
churchyard
near
the
river
;
in
a
churchyard
so
obscure
that
there
be
nothing
in
it
<EOS>
but
grass
-
mound
,
not
so
much
as
one
single
tombstone
.
<EOS>
It
may
not
be
to
do
an
unreasonably
great
deal
for
the
digger
and
hewer
,
in
a
registering
age
,
if
we
ticket
their
grave
at
the
common
charge
;
so
that
a
new
generation
may
know
which
be
which
:
so
that
the
soldier
,
sailor
,
emigrant
,
come
home
,
should
be
able
to
identify
the
resting
-
place
of
father
,
mother
,
playmate
,
or
betroth
.
<EOS>
for
,
we
turn
up
our
eye
and
say
that
we
be
all
alike
in
death
,
and
we
may
turn
them
down
and
work
the
saying
out
in
this
world
,
so
far
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
sentimental
,
perhaps
?

how

ye

my
lord

board

shall
we
not

good
standing

room

mangle

very

so

feeble

"
She
warn't

this
ghostly
counsel
rather
ill

remove

back

grave
in

corner

lay
it
down

weep
alone

homely

undisturbed

the
water

wheel
of
the

be
audible
there

seem

have
a
softening
influence

the
bright
wintry
scene

<EOS>
They
have
arrive

a
little
while
before

Lizzie
Hexam
now
tell
them
the
little
she
could
add
to
the
letter
in
which
she
have
enclose
Mr.
Rokesmith

letter

have
ask
for
their
instruction

<EOS>
this
be
merely
how
she
have
hear
the
groan
,

what
have
afterwards
pass
,

how
she
have
obtain
leave
for
the
remain

be
place
in

sweet
,
fresh
,
empty
store
-
room
of
the
mill
from

they
have
just
accompany
them
to
the
churchyard

how
the
last
request
have
be
religiously
observe

suppose

try

bristle
in

good
little
way

as

ask

Mrs.

Lizzie
shake
her

still
smile

They
have
never
ask
me
what
my

They
ask
me
what
my
story
be

I
tell
them
.
<EOS>
They
ask
me
to
be
industrious

faithful
,

I
promise
to
be
so

<EOS>
They
most
willingly

cheerfully
do
their
duty

all
of
us
who
be
employ
here

we
try
to
do
ours
to
them

<EOS>
indeed
they
do
much
more
than
their
duty

wonderfully
mindful

many
way

ungrateful

Lizzie

I
have
be
already
raise
to

that
make
no

it

My

while

both

great
attention

<EOS>
bring
face
to
face
for
the
first

with
the
daughter
of
his
suppose
murderer

it
be
natural
that
John
Harmon
should
have
his
own
secret
reason
for
a
careful
scrutiny
of
her
countenance
and
manner
.
<EOS>
Bella
know
that
Lizzie

father
have
be
falsely
accuse
of
the
crime
which
have
have
so
great
an
influence
on
her
own
life

fortune
;
and
her
interest
,
though
it
have
no
secret
spring
,
like
that
of
the
Secretary
,
be
equally
natural
.
<EOS>
both
have
expect
to
see
something
very
different
from
the
real
Lizzie
Hexam
,
and
thus
it
fall
out
that
she
become
the
unconscious
mean
of
bring
them
together

when

down

false

<EOS>
when

suddenly
brightened

upon
my

no

for

I

there
be
tear
in

they
be
pretty

smote
him
on

rather
reproachfully

one
of

what

You
remember
,
of

that
in
her
short
letter
to
Mrs.

short

contain
everything

It

out

I
have
it
in
charge
from
Mr.

to
discover
,

I
be
very
desirous
for
myself
to
discover
,
whether
that
retract
accusation
still
leave
any
stain
upon
her

I

whether
it

even
towards

yes

plainly

away

I

sure

easy
confidence
would
arise
between

you
would
not

,
heave
a
little
sigh
,
and
give
up
thing
in
general
for
a
bad
job
,
as
she
have
previously
be
incline
to
give
up
herself
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
for
all
that
,
they
have
a
very
pleasant
walk
.
<EOS>
the
tree
be
bare
of
leave
,
and
the
river
be
bare
of
water
-
lily
;
but
the
sky
be
not
bare
of
its
beautiful
blue
,
and
the
water
reflect
it
,
and
a
delicious
wind
run
with
the
stream
,
touch
the
surface
crisply
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
old
mirror
be
never
yet
make
by
human
hand
,
which
,
if
all
the
image
it
have
in
its
time
reflect
could
pass
across
its
surface
again
,
would
fail
to
reveal
some
scene
of
horror
or
distress
.
<EOS>
but
the
great
serene
mirror
of
the
river
seem
as
if
it
may
have
reproduce
all
it
have
ever
reflect
between
those
placid
bank
,
and
bring
nothing
to
the
light
save
what
be
peaceful
,
pastoral
,
and
bloom
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
they
walk
,
speak
of
the
newly
fill
-
up
grave
,
and
of
Johnny
,
and
of
many
thing
.
<EOS>
so
,
on
their
return
,
they
meet
brisk
Mrs.
Milvey
come
to
seek
them
,
with
the
agreeable
intelligence
that
there
be
no
fear
for
the
village
child
,
there
be
a
christian
school
in
the
village
,
and
no
bad
judaical
interference
with
it
than
to
plant
its
garden
.
<EOS>
so
,
they
get
back
to
the
village
as
Lizzie
Hexam
be
come
from
the
paper
-
mill
,
and
Bella
detach
herself
to
speak
with
her
in
her
own
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
it
be
a
poor
room
for
you
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
with
a
smile
of
welcome
,
as
she
offer
the
post
of
honor
by
the
fireside
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
so
poor
as
you
think
,
my
dear
,
"
return
Bella
,
"
if
you
know
all
.
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
though
attain
by
some
wonderful
winding
narrow
stair
,
which
seem
to
have
be
erect
in
a
pure
white
chimney
,
and
though
very
low
in
the
ceiling
,
and
very
rugged
in
the
floor
,
and
rather
blink
as
to
the
proportion
of
its
lattice
window
,
it
be
a
pleasanter
room
than
that
despised
chamber
once
at
home
,
in
which
Bella
have
first
bemoan
the
misery
of
take
lodger
.
  
<EOS>
the
day
be
close
as
the
two
girl
look
at
one
another
by
the
fireside
.
<EOS>
the
dusky
room
be
light
by
the
fire
.
<EOS>
the
grate
may
have
be
the
old
brazier
,
and
the
glow
may
have
be
the
old
hollow
down
by
the
flare
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
quite
new
to
me
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
"
to
be
visit
by
a
lady
so
nearly
of
my
own
age
,
and
so
pretty
,
as
you
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pleasure
to
me
to
look
at
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
leave
to
begin
with
,
"
return
Bella
,
blush
,
"
because
I
be
go
to
say
that
it
be
a
pleasure
to
me
to
look
at
you
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
but
we
can
begin
without
a
beginning
,
can
not
we
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
take
the
pretty
little
hand
that
be
hold
out
in
as
pretty
a
little
frankness
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
dear
,
"
say
Bella
,
draw
her
chair
a
little
nearer
,
and
take
Lizzie
's
arm
as
if
they
be
go
out
for
a
walk
,
"
I
be
commission
with
something
to
say
,
and
I
dare
say
I
shall
say
it
wrong
,
but
I
will
not
if
I
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
reference
to
your
letter
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
,
and
this
be
what
it
be
.
<EOS>
let
me
see
.
<EOS>
oh
yes
!
<EOS>
this
be
what
it
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
this
exordium
,
Bella
set
forth
that
request
of
Lizzie
's
touching
secresy
,
and
delicately
speak
of
that
false
accusation
and
its
retractation
,
and
ask
may
she
beg
to
be
inform
whether
it
have
any
bearing
,
near
or
remote
,
on
such
request
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
,
my
dear
.
"
say
Bella
,
quite
amazing
herself
by
the
business
-
like
manner
in
which
she
be
get
on
,
"
that
the
subject
must
be
a
painful
one
to
you
,
but
I
be
mix
up
in
it
also
;
for
---
I
do
not
know
whether
you
may
know
it
or
suspect
it
<EOS>
---
I
be
the
will

away
girl
who
be
to
have
be
marry
to
the
unfortunate
gentleman
,
if
he
have
be
pleased
to
approve
of
me
.
<EOS>
so
I
be
drag
into
the
subject
without
my
consent
,
and
you
be
drag
into
it
without
your
consent
,
and
there
be
very
little
to
choose
between
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
"
that
you
be
the
Miss
Wilfer

have
often

<EOS>
Can

<EOS>
Bella
have
never

<EOS>
He

do
a
great
deal
for
me

<EOS>
I
must
hope
that
he
will
let
me

him
some
day

<EOS>
You
ask
me
have
it
anything
to

"
  
"
It
or
the
accusation
itself
,
"
Bella
put
in

<EOS>
"
yes

have
either
anything
to
do
with
my
wishing
to
live
quite
secret
and
retire
here

<EOS>
no

"
  
<EOS>
as
Lizzie
Hexam
shake
her
head
in
give
this
reply
and
as
her
glance
seek
the
fire
,
there
be
a
quiet
resolution
in
her
folded
hand
,
not
lose
on
Bella
's
bright
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
live
much
alone

"
ask
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
It
be
nothing
new
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
use
to
be
always
alone
<EOS>
many
hour
together
,
in
the
day
and
in
the
night
,
when
poor
father
be
alive

<EOS>
"
You

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
brother

but
he
be
not
friendly
with
me

<EOS>
He
be
a
very
good
boy
though

and
have
raise
himself
by
his
industry

<EOS>
I
do
not

"
  
<EOS>
as
she
say
it
,
with
her
eye
upon
the
fire
-
glow
,
there
be
an
instantaneous
escape
of
distress
into
her
face
.
<EOS>
Bella
seize
the
moment
to
touch
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
,
I
wish
you
would
tell
me
whether
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
live
that
lonely

the
answer

<EOS>
"
nor
I
neither

Bella

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
not
that
my
life
have
be
lonely

for
I
could
have
sometimes

it
lonely

Ma
go
on
like
the
Tragic
Muse
with
a
face

ache
in
majestic
corner

Lavvy
be
spiteful

<EOS>
I
wish
you
could
make
a
friend

Lizzie

do
you
think
you
could

<EOS>
I
have
no
more
of
what
they
call
character

my

than
a
canary

bird

<EOS>
I
know
I
be
trustworthy

<EOS>
the
wayward
,
playful
,
affectionate
nature
,
giddy
for
want
of
the
weight
of
some
sustaining
purpose
,
and
capricious
because
it
be
always
flutter
among
little
thing
,
be
yet
a
captivate
one
.
<EOS>
to
Lizzie
it
be
so
new
,
so
pretty
,
at
once
so
womanly
and
so
childish
,
that
it
win
her
completely
.
<EOS>
and
when
Bella
say
again
,
"
do
you
think
you
could
,
Lizzie
?
"
<EOS>
with
her
eyebrow
raise
,
her
head
inquiringly
on
one
side
,
and
an
odd
doubt
about
it
in
her
own
bosom
<EOS>
,
Lizzie
show
beyond
all
question
that
she
think
she
could

<EOS>
"
tell
me

what

<EOS>
Lizzie
presently
begin
,
by
way
of
prelude
,
"
You
must
have
many
lover

"
when
Bella
check
her
with
a
little
scream
of
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
My

,
I
have
not

<EOS>
"
not
one

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
perhaps
one

Bella

<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
do
not

<EOS>
I
have
one
,
but
what
he
may
think
about
it
at
the
present
time
I
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
have
half
a
one
(
of
course
I
do
not
count
that
Idiot
,
George
Sampson
)
.
<EOS>
however
,
never
mind
me
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
hear
about
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
certain
man
,
"
say
Lizzie
,
"
a
passionate
and
angry
man
,
who
say
he
love
me

who
I
must
believe
do
love
me

<EOS>
He
be
the
friend

<EOS>
I
shrink
from
him
within
myself
when
my

first
bring
him
to
me

the
last
time
I
see
him
he
terrify
me
more
than
I
can

there
she
stop

do
you
come
here
to
escape
from
him

I
come
here

so
alarm
me

<EOS>
"
be
you
afraid
of
him
here
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
timid
generally
,
but
I
be
always
afraid
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
to
see
a
newspaper
,
or
to
hear
a
word
speak
of
what
be
do
in
London
,
lest
he
should
have
do
some
violence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
be
not
afraid
of
him
for
yourself
,
dear

"
say
Bella
,
after
ponder
on
the
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
even
that
,
if
I
meet
him
about
here
.
<EOS>
I
look
round
for
him
always
,
as
I
pass
to
and
fro
at
night

<EOS>
"
be
you
afraid

anything
he
may
do
to
himself
in
London

<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
fierce
enough
even
to
do
some
violence
to
himself
,
but
I
do
not
think
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
it
would
almost
seem
,
dear

"
say
Bella
quaintly
,
"
as
if
there
must
be
somebody
else
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
put
her
hand
before
her
face
for
a
moment
before
reply
:
"
the
word
be
always
in
my
car
,
and
the
blow
he
strike
upon
a
stone
wall
as
he
say
them
be
always
before
my
eye

<EOS>
I
have
try
hard
to
think
it
not
worth
remember

I
can
not

so
little
of
it

<EOS>
His
hand
be
trickle
down

rather
startle
,
Bella
make
and
clasp
a
girdle
of
her
arm
round
Lizzie

waist
,
and
then
ask
quietly
,
in
a
soft
voice
,
as
they
both
look
at
the
fire
:
  
<EOS>
"
kill
him

be
this

so
jealous

of

I
hardly
know
how

cease

press

upon

live
girdle

it
through
his
influence

you
come
here

no

of
all

I

"
Lizzie
,
dear

<EOS>
why
?

"
ask
Bella
,
in
amazement
at
this
burst

<EOS>
but
then
quickly
add
,
read
Lizzie

face
:

no

there
be
silence
between

with
a
drooping
head

glance
down
at
the
glow
in
the
fire
where
her
first
fancy
have

her
first
escape

from

reward

raise
her
eye
to

.

there
be
nothing
leave
out

this
be
my

secret

the

good
old

heavy

you

even
in
freedom

Would
not
it
be
well
not
to
live
a

life
in
hiding

not

be
shut
out
from
your

wholesome

<EOS>
the
question
be
so
directly
at
variance
with
Bella
's
view
in
life
,
as
set
forth
to
her
father

that
she

internally
,
"
there
,
you
little
mercenary
wretch

you

not
you
ashamed

unclasp
the

herself
a

poke
in

lose

of

good
encouragement

good
object

I
carry
through

love
me

I
should
have
try
with

all

conquer
the
difficulty

away

leave
off

the

good

oppress
by
terror

cross
half

up

another
loop

would
all

have
his
foot
on
the
opposite
pavement

would
see

imagine
something
come

would
stagger
back
again

<EOS>
there
,
he
would
stand
make
spasmodic
preparation
as
if
for
a
great
leap

at
last
would
decide
on
a
start
at
precisely
the
wrong
moment

would
be
roar
at
by
driver

and
would
shrink
back
once
more

stand
in
the
old
spot
shivering

whole
of

proceeding

I
own
to
the
weakness

to
occupy

ludicrous
position

therefore
I
transfer
the
position
to
the
scout

<EOS>
"
  
"
I
wish
,
Eugene
,
you
would
speak
a
little
more
soberly

plainly
,
if
it

only
out
of
consideration
for
my
feeling
less
at
ease

you
do

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
then
soberly
and
plainly
,
Mortimer
,
I
goad
the
schoolmaster
to
madness
.
<EOS>
I
make
the
schoolmaster
,
so
ridiculous
,
and
so
aware
of
be
make
ridiculous
,
that
I
see
him
chafe
and
fret
at
every
pore
when
we
cross
one
another
.
<EOS>
the
amiable
occupation
have
be
the
solace
of
my
life
,
since
I
be
baulk
in
the
manner
unnecessary
to
recall
.
<EOS>
I
have
derive
inexpressible
comfort
from
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
it
thus
:
I
stroll
out
after
dark
,
stroll
a
little
way
,
look
in
at
a
window
and
furtively
look
out
for
the
schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
sooner
or
later
,
I
perceive
the
schoolmaster
on
the
watch
;
sometimes
accompany
by
his
hopeful
pupil
;
oftener
,
pupil
-
less
.
<EOS>
have
make
sure
of
his
watch
me
,
I
tempt
him
on
,
all
over
London
.
<EOS>
one
night
I
go
east
,
another
night
north
,
in
a
few
night
I
go
all
round
the
compass
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
I
walk
;
sometimes
,
I
proceed
in
cabs
,
drain
the
pocket
of
the
schoolmaster
who
then
follow
in
cabs
.
<EOS>
I
study
and
get
up
abstruse
no
thoroughfare
in
the
course
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
with
venetian
mystery
I
seek
those
no
thoroughfare
at
night
,
glide
into
them
by
mean
of
dark
court
,
tempt
the
schoolmaster
to
follow
,
turn
suddenly
,
and
catch
him
before
he
can
retreat
.
<EOS>
then
we
face
one
another
,
and
I
pass
him
as
unaware
of
his
existence
,
and
he
undergo
grind
torment
.
<EOS>
similarly
,
I
walk
at
a
great
pace
down
a
short
street
,
rapidly
turn
the
corner
,
and
,
get
out
of
his
view
,
as
rapidly
turn
back
.
<EOS>
I
catch
him
come
on
post
,
again
pass
him
as
unaware
of
his
existence

and
again
he
undergo
grind
torment
.
<EOS>
night
after
night
his
disappointment
be
acute
,
but
hope
spring
eternal
in
the
scholastic
breast
,
and
he
follow
me
again
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
thus
I
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
the
chase
,
and
derive
great
benefit
from
the
healthful
exercise
.
<EOS>
when
I
do
not

Gate

Will

laugh
through
his
gravity

I
be
always
serious

just
now
I
be
a
little
excited
by

glorious
fact

wind

a
cloudy
sky
proclaim
a
hunting
evening

ready

so

We
turn
out
the
lamp

the
two
friend
pass
out

public
street

Eugene
demand
with
a
show
of
courteous
patronage
in
which
direction
Mortimer
would
like
the
run
to
be
?
"
<EOS>
there
be
a
rather
difficult
country
about
Bethnal
Green
,

say
Eugene
,
"

we
have
not
take
in
that
direction
lately

what
be
your
opinion
of
Bethnal
Green

<EOS>
Mortimer
assent
to
Bethnal
Green

they
turn
eastward
.

now
,
when
we
come
to
St.

's
churchyard

loiter
artfully

I
will
show
you

<EOS>
but
,
they
both
see
him
,
before
they
get
there
;
alone
,
and
steal
after
them
in
the
shadow
of
the
house
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way

<EOS>
"
get
your
wind

Eugene

I
be
off
directly

it
occur

you

Merry
England
will
begin
to
deteriorate
in
an
educational
light

if
this
last
long

be
off

<EOS>
at
what
a
rate
he
go
,
to
breathe
the
schoolmaster
;
and
how
he
then
lounge
and
loiter
,
to
put
his
patience
to
another
kind
of
wear
;
what
preposterous
way
he
take
,
with
no
other
object
on
earth
than
to
disappoint
and
punish
him
;
and
how
he
wear
him
out
by
every
piece
of
ingenuity
that
his
eccentric
humour
could
devise
;
all
this
Lightwood
note
,
with
a
feeling
of
astonishment
that
so
careless
a
man
could
be
so
wary
,
and
that
so
idle
a
man
could
take
so
much
trouble

<EOS>
at
last
,
far
on
in
the
third
hour
of
the
pleasure
of
the
chase
,
when
he
have
bring
the
poor
dogging
wretch
round
again
into

City

twist
Mortimer
up
a
few
dark
entry

twist
him
into

little
square
court

him
sharp
round
again

almost
run
against
Bradley
Headstone

Eugene
aloud

themselves

torment

be
not
too
strong

phrase
for
the
occasion

look

hunted

not
the
hunter

baffle
,
wear

with
the
exhaustion

lipped

with

himself

it
all

exult
in
it

go
by
them
in

dark

like
a
haggard
head

in

so
completely
do

away

More

break
loose

tame

under
his
daily
restraint

it

his
compensation

not
his

to
give
a
glance
towards
his

at

It
would
furnish
another
reason

of
it

Bradley
could
have
hide

His
flying

for

the

He

<EOS>
what
he
may
gain
by
this
acquaintance

he
could
not

out

cumbrous
thought

<EOS>
the
man
have
an
injury
against
the
object
of
his
hatred
,
and
that
be
something
;
though
it
be
less
than
he
suppose
,
for
there
dwelt
in
the
man
no
such
deadly
rage

resentment
as

<EOS>
the
man

may
by

her

that
be
something

the

be
a
bad

<EOS>
that

something

for
his

be
as
bad
as

he
seem
to
derive
a
vague
support
from
the
possession
of
a
congenial
instrument
,
though
it
may
never
be
use

<EOS>
suddenly
he
stand
still
,
and
ask
Riderhood
point
-
blank
if
he
know
where
she
be
?
<EOS>
clearly
,
he
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
He
ask
Riderhood
if
he
would
be
willing

in
case
any
intelligence

seek
her

should
fall
in

it

it

He
would

He

he

then
he
must
have
a

a

one
that
will

an

very
well

consider
his

give
up

if
I
be
to

advice

Rokesmith

I
should
have
to
buy
him
out

<EOS>
sooner

later

<EOS>
Mr.

listen
to
these
lamentation
in
silence
,
while
Mr.
Boffin
jog
to

fro

hold
his
pocket
as

have
a
pain
in
them

"
after
all

out
of

how
do

<EOS>
Venus
reply
that
as
Wegg
have
find
the
document
and
hand
it
to
him
,
it
be
his
intention
to
hand
it
back
to
Wegg
,
with
the
declaration
that
he
himself
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
it
,
or
do
with
it
,
and
that
Wegg
must
act
as
he
choose
,
and
take
the
consequence
.

then
he
drop
down

Mr.

ruefully

"
I
would
sooner
be
drop
upon

you

by
him

or
even
by
you
jintly

by
him
alone
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
could
only
repeat
that
it
be
his
fix
intention
to
betake
himself
to
the
path
of
science
,
and
to
walk
in
the
same
all
the
day
of
his
life
;
not
drop
down
upon
his
fellow

creature
until
they
be
deceased
,
and
then
only
to
articulate
them
to
the
good
of
his
humble
ability

how
long
could
you

up
the

Mr.

on
his
other

Mr.

with

whether

can

that
he
mean
,
when
I
have
buy
Wegg
out
,
to
have
me
all
to
himself
and
to
pick
me
clean
to
the
bone

"
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
cunning
and
suspicious
idea
,
quite
in
the
way
of
his
school
of
Misers
,
and
he
look
very
cunning
and
suspicious
as
he
go
jog
through
the
street
.
<EOS>
More
than
once
or
twice
,
more
than
twice
or
thrice
,
say
half
a
dozen
time
,
he
take
his
stick
from
the
arm
on
which
he
nurse
it
,
and
hit
a
straight
sharp
rap
at
the
air
with
its
head
.
<EOS>
possibly
the
wooden
countenance
of
Mr.
Silas
Wegg
be
incorporeally
before
him
at
those
moment
,
for
he
hit
with
intense
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
within
a
few
street
of
his
own
house
,
when
a
little
private
carriage
,
come
in
the
contrary
direction
,
pass
him
,
turn
round
,
and
pass
him
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
little
carriage
of
eccentric
movement
,
for
again
he
hear
it
stop
behind
him
and
turn
round
,
and
again
he
see
it
pass
him
.
<EOS>
then
it
stop
,
and
then
go
on

out

<EOS>
but
,
not
far
out

for
,
when
he
come
to
the
corner
of
his

there
it
stand
again
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
lady

face
at
the
window
as
he
come
up
with
this
carriage

he
be
pass
it

the

softly
call
to
him
by

"
I
would
rather
not

Mr.

particularly
wish

I
feel
the

so
much

I
would
rather

Mr.
Boffin

no

mean
yes

It
be
because
I

so
grateful

so
touch
by
it

that
I
can
not
bear
to
run
the
risk

forfeit
it

<EOS>
I
have
ask
my

spare

Would

Mr.

what
next
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
GOLDEN
DUSTMAN
<EOS>
at
<EOS>
his
WORST
.
 
<EOS>
the
breakfast
table
at
Mr.
Boffin
's
be
usually
a
very
pleasant
one
,
and
be
always
preside
over
by
Bella
.
<EOS>
as
though
he
begin
each
new
day
in
his
healthy
natural
character
,
and
some
wake
hour
be
necessary
to
his
relapse
into
the
corrupting
influence
of
his
wealth
,
the
face
and
the
demeanour
of
the
Golden
Dustman
be
generally
unclouded
at
that
meal

<EOS>
It
would
have
be
easy
to
believe
then
,
that
there
be
no
change
in
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
the
day
go
on
that
the
cloud
gather
,
and
the
brightness
of
the
morning
become
obscure
.
<EOS>
one
may
have
say
that
the
shadow
of
avarice
and
distrust
lengthen
as
his
own
shadow
lengthen
,
and
that
the
night
close
around
him
gradually

,
one
morning
long
afterwards
to
be
remember

it
be
black
midnight
with
the
Golden
Dustman

he
first
appear

<EOS>
His
altered
character
have
never

<EOS>
His
bearing
towards
his
Secretary
be
so
charge
with
insolent
distrust

arrogance

the
latter
rise
and
leave
the
table
before
breakfast
be
half
do

<EOS>
the
look
he
direct
at
the
Secretary

retire
figure
be
so
cunningly
malignant

that
Bella
would
have
sit
astounded
and
indignant
,
even
though
he
have
not
go
the
length
of
secretly
threaten
Rokesmith
with
his
clenched
fist

close

next

when

may
make
it
tell

the

<EOS>
Bradley
smile
sourly
at
the
ignorance
he
would
have
correct
in
one
of
his
pupil
,
and
continue
to
look
down
into
the
water
,
as
if
the
place
have
a
gloomy
fascination
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
like
it
,
"
say
Riderhood
.
  
<EOS>
He
take
no
notice
,
but
stand
look
down
,
as
if
he
have
not
hear
the
word
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
very
dark
expression
on
his
face
;
an
expression
that
the
Rogue
find
it
hard
to
understand
.
<EOS>
It
be
fierce
,
and
full
of
purpose
;
but
the
purpose
may
have
be
as
much
against
himself
as
against
another
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
step
back
for
a
spring
,
take
a
leap
,
and
throw
himself
in
,
it
would
have
be
no
surprising
sequel
to
the
look
.
<EOS>
perhaps
his
troubled
soul
,
set
upon
some
violence
,
do
hover
for
the
moment
between
that
violence
and
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
say
,
"
ask
Riderhood
,
after
watch
him
for
a
while
with
a
sidelong
glance
,
"
as
you
have
come
back
for
a

hour

,
even
then

him
with

answer

<EOS>
with
the
look

one
just
awaken

follow
Riderhood
into
the
Lock

house
,
where
the
latter
produce
from
a
cupboard
some
cold
salt
beef

half
a

some

with
which
reflection
he
sit
down
on

throw
open

Riderhood

him

again

again

He
go
into
the
pelting
rain
again
with
his
head
bare
,
and
bend
low
over
the
river
,
and
scooping
up
the
water
with
his
two
hand
,
wash
the
blood
away
.
<EOS>
all
beyond
his
figure
,
as
Riderhood
look
from
the
door
,
be
a
vast
dark
curtain
in
solemn
movement
towards
one
quarter
of
the
heavens
.
<EOS>
He
raise
his
head
and
come
back
,
wet
from
head
to
foot
,
but
with
the
low
part
of
his
sleeve
,
where
he
have
dip
into
the
river
,
streaming
water
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your

do
you

the
sullen
retort

down
now

I
will

the
bottle
and
jug
be
again
produce
,
and
he
mix
a
weak
draught
,
and
another
,

drank
both
in
quick
succession

You
ask
me
something

then

turn
upon

desperate
manner

<EOS>
"
how
can
a
man
in

state
know

he
answer
,
protest
with
both
his
tremulous
hand
,
with
an
action
so
vigorously
angry
that
he
shake
the
water
from
his
sleeve
upon
the
floor
,
as
if
he
have
wring
them
.

how
can
I
plan
anything

it
again

<EOS>
sleep

the

"
  
<EOS>
His
pointing
to
the
truckle
bed
in
the
corner
,
seem
gradually
to
bring
that
poor
couch
to
Bradley
's
wander
remembrance
.
<EOS>
He
slip
off
his
wear
down
-
trodden
shoe
,
and
east
himself
heavily
,
all
wet
as
he
be
,
upon
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
Riderhood
sit
down
in
his
wooden
arm
-
chair
,
and
look
through
the
window
at
the
lightning
,
and
listen
to
the
thunder
.
<EOS>
but
,
his
thought
be
far
from
be
absorb
by
the
thunder
and
the
lightning
,
for
again
and
again
and
again
he
look
very
curiously
at
the
exhausted
man
upon
the
bed
.
<EOS>
the
man
have
turn
up
the
collar
of
the
rough
coat
he
wear
,
to
shelter
himself
from
the
storm
,
and
have
button
it
about
his
neck
.
<EOS>
unconscious
of
that
,
and
of
most
thing
,
he
have
leave
the
coat
so
,
both
when
he
have
lave
his
face
in
the
river
,
and
when
he
have
cast
himself
upon
the
bed
;
though
it
would
have
be
much
easy
to
him
if
he
have
unloosen
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
thunder
roll
heavily
,
and
the
fork
lightning
seem
to
make
jagged
rent
in
every
part
of
the
vast
curtain
without
,
as
Riderhood
sit
by
the
window
,
glance
at
the
bed
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
he
see
the
man
upon
the
bed
,
by
a
red
light
;
sometimes
,
by
a
blue
;
 
sometimes
,
he
scarcely
see
him
in
the
darkness
of
the
storm
;
sometimes
he
see
nothing
of
him
in
the
blind
glare
of
palpitate
white
fire
.
<EOS>
Anon
,
the
rain
would
come
again
with
a
tremendous
rush
,
and
the
river
would
seem
to
rise
to
meet
it
,
and
a
blast
of
wind
,
burst
upon
the
door
,
would
flutter
the
hair
and
dress
of
the
man
,
as
if
invisible
messenger
be
come
around
the
bed
to
carry
him
away
.
<EOS>
from
all
these
phase
of
the
storm
,
Riderhood
would
turn
,
as
if
they
be
interruption
---
rather
strike
interruption
possibly
,
but
interruption
still
---
of
his
scrutiny
of
the
sleeper
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
sleep
sound
,
"
he
say
within
himself
;
"
yet
he
be
that
up
to
me
and
that
noticing
of
me
that
my
get
out
of
my
chair
may
wake
him
,
when
a
rattle
peal
will
not
;
let
alone
my
touching
of
him
.

<EOS>
He
very
cautiously
rise
to
his
foot
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
t'other
,
"
he
say
,
in
a
low
,
calm
voice
,
"
be
you
a
lie
easy
?
<EOS>
there
be
a
chill
in
the
air

governor

<EOS>
Shall
I
put
a
coat
over
you
?

<EOS>
no
answer

<EOS>
"
that
be
about
what
it
be
a'ready

,
you
see

mutter
riderhood
in
a
low
and
a
different
voice
;
"
a
coat
over
you
,
a
coat
over
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
sleeper
move
an
arm
,
he
sit
down
again
in
his
chair
,
and
feign
to
watch
the
storm
from
the
window
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
grand
spectacle
,
but
not
so
grand
as
to
keep
his
eye
,
for
half
a
minute
together
,
from
steal
a
look
at
the
man
upon
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
at
the
conceal
throat
of
the
sleeper
that
Riderhood
so
often
look
so
curiously
,
until
the
sleep
seem
to
deepen
into
the
stupor
of
the
dead
-
tired
in
mind
and
body
.
<EOS>
then
,
Riderhood
come
from
the
window
cautiously
,
and
stand
by
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
poor
man
!
"
<EOS>
he
murmur
in
a
low
tone
,
with
a
crafty
face
,
and
a
very
watchful
eye
and
ready
foot
,
lest
he
should
start
up
;
"
this
here
coat
of
his
must
make
him
uneasy
in
his
sleep
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
loosen
if
for
him
,
and
make
him
more
comfortable
?
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
I
think
I
ought
to
it
,
poor
man
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
touch
the
first
button
with
a
very
caution
hand
,
and
a
step
backward
.
<EOS>
but
,
the
sleeper
remain
in
profound
unconsciousness
,
he
touch
the
other
button
with
a
more
assured
hand
,
and
perhaps
the
more
lightly
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
softly
and
slowly
,
he
open
the
coat
and
draw
it
back
.
  
<EOS>
the
draggle
end
of
a
bright
-
red
neckerchief
be
then
disclose
,
and
he
have
even
be
at
the
pain
of
dip
part
of
it
in
some
liquid
,
to
give
it
the
appearance
of
have
become
stain
by
wear
.
<EOS>
with
a
much
-
perplex
face
,
Riderhood
look
from
it
to
the
sleeper
,
and
from
the
sleeper
to
it
,
and
finally
creep
back
to
his
chair
,
and
there
,
with
his
hand
to
his
chin
,
sit
long
in
a
brown
study
,
look
at
both
.

GOLDEN

a
LITTLE

Mr.

They

uninvited

have
press
themselves
with
so
much
urgency

golden
couple

that
evasion

Mr.

Mrs.
Boffin
have
the
curiosity
softly
to
raise
a
window
and
look
after
them
as
they
go
down
the
long
street
.
<EOS>
They
walk
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
showily
enough
,
but
without
appear
to
interchange
a
syllable
.
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
fanciful
to
suppose
that
under
their
outer
bearing
there
be
something
of
the
shamed
air
of
two
cheat
who
be
link
together
by
conceal
handcuff
;
but
,
not
so
,
to
suppose
that
they
be
haggardly
weary
of
one
another
,
of
themselves
,
and
of
all
this
world
.
<EOS>
in
turn
the
street
corner
they
may
have
turn
out
of
this
world
,
for
anything

ever
see
of
them
to
the
contrary

Mrs.

after
a
five
o'clock
dinner
,
and
trot
out
,
nurse
his
big
stick
in
both
arm
,
so
that
,
as
of
old
,
it
seem
to
be
whisper
in
his
ear
.
<EOS>
He
carry
so
very
attentive
an
expression
on
his
countenance
that
it
appear
as
if
the
confidential
discourse
of
the
big
stick
require
to
be
follow
closely
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
's
face
be
like
the
face
of
a
thoughtful
listener
to
an
intricate
communication
,
and
,
in
trot
along
,
he
occasionally
glance
at
that
companion
with
the
look
of
a
man
who
be
interpose
the
remark
:
"

You
do
not

<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
and
his
stick
go
on
alone
together
,
until
they
arrive
at
certain
cross
-
way
where
they
would
be
likely
to
fall
in
with
any
one
come
,
at
about
the
same
time
,
from
Clerkenwell
to
the
Bower
.
<EOS>
here
they
stop
,
and
Mr.

consult
his

with
his
two
wooden
leg

take
an
observation
of
R.

<EOS>
there
be
no

in
the
case

Gruff

Glum

out

the
cherubic
parent
be
bear
down
and
crowd
on
direct
for
Greenwich
church
,
to
see
his
relation
.
  
<EOS>
for
,
Gruff
and
Glum
,
though
most
event
act
on
him
simply
as
tobacco
-
stopper
,
press
down
and
condense
the
quid
within
him
,
may
be
imagine
to
trace
a
family
resemblance
between
the
cherub
in
the
church
architecture
,
and
the
cherub
in
the
white
waistcoat
.
<EOS>
some
remembrance
of
old
Valentines
,
wherein
a
cherub
,
less
appropriately
attire
for
a
proverbially
uncertain
climate
,
have
be
see
conduct
lover
to
the

may
have

to
inflame
the
ardour
of
his

<EOS>
be
it
as
it
may
,
he
give
his
mooring
the
slip

and
follow
in
chase

<EOS>
the
cherub
go
before
,
all
beam
smile
;
Bella
and
John
Rokesmith
follow
;
Gruff
and
Glum
stick
to
them
like
wax
.
<EOS>
for
year
,
the
wing
of
his
mind
have
go
to
look
after
the
leg
of
his
body
;
but
Bella
have
bring
them
back
for
him
per
steamer
,
and
they
be
spread
again
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
slow
sailer
on
a
wind
of
happiness
,
but
he
take
a
cross
cut
for
the
rendezvous
,
and
peg
away
as
if
he
be
score
furiously
at
cribbage
.
<EOS>
when
the
shadow
of
the
church
-
porch
swallow
them
up
,
victorious
Gruff
and
Glum
likewise
present
himself
to
be
swallow
up
.
<EOS>
and
by
this
time
the
cherubic
parent
be
so
fearful
of
surprise
,
that
,
but
for
the
two
wooden
leg
on
which
Gruff
and
Glum
be
reassuringly
mount
,
his
conscience
may
have
introduce
,
in
the
person
of
that
pensioner
,
his
own
stately
lady
disguise
,
arrive
at
Greenwich
in
a
car
and
griffin
,
like
the
spiteful
Fairy
at
the
christening
of
the
Princesses
,
to
do
something
dreadful
to
the
marriage
service
.
<EOS>
and
truly
he
have
a
momentary
reason
to
be
pale
of
face
,
and
to
whisper
to
Bella
,
"
You
do
not
think
that
can
be
your
Ma
;
do
you
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
on
account
of
a
mysterious
rustling
and
a
stealthy
movement
somewhere
in
the
remote
neighbourhood
of
the
organ
,
though
it
be
go
directly
and
be
hear
no
more

<EOS>
albeit
it
be

as
will

<EOS>
who

<EOS>
I

and
so

<EOS>
who

R.

Forasmuch
,
Gruff
and
Glum
,
as
John
and
Bella
have
consent
together
in
holy
wedlock
,
you
may
(
in
short
)
consider
it
do
,
and
withdraw
your
two
wooden
leg
from
this
temple
.
<EOS>
to
the
foregoing

,
the

speak

selectly
represent

<EOS>
and
now
,
the
church

porch
have
swallow
up
Bella
Wilfer
for
ever
and
ever
,
have
it
not
in
its
power
to
relinquish
that
young
woman
,
but
slide
into
the
happy
sunlight
,
Mrs.
John

instead
.
<EOS>
and
long
on
the
bright
step
stand
Gruff
and
Glum
,
look
after
the
pretty
bride
,
with
a
narcotic
consciousness
of

a
dream

<EOS>
after
which
,
Bella
take
out
from
her
pocket
a
little
letter
,
and
read
it
aloud
to
Pa
and
John
;
this
be
a
true
copy
of
the

.
  
<EOS>
"
Dearest

I

angry

who
love
me
better
than
I
can
ever

except
by
love

<EOS>
I
think
it

not

it
beforehand

in

it
should
cause
any

then

John

put
the

the
letter

when

Her
Gracious

look
so
benign

<EOS>
and
then

pop
it
into

and
say
merrily
,
"
now
,
dear

you
be
safe

"
  
<EOS>
Pa
be
,
at
first
,
in
the
stirred
depth
of
his
conscience
,
so
far
from
sure
of

safe
yet
,
that
he
make
out
majestic
matron
lurk
in
ambush
among
the
harmless
tree
of
Greenwich
Park
,
and
seem
to
see
a
stately
countenance
tie
up
in
a
well

handkerchief
gloome
down
at
him
from

window
of

where
the

<EOS>
but
,
the
minute
pass
on

no

he
become
more
confident

and
so
repair
with
good
heart
and
appetite
to
Mr.

Mrs.
John
Rokesmith
's
cottage
on
Blackheath
,
where
breakfast

<EOS>
a
modest
little
cottage
but
a
bright
and
a
fresh
,
and
on
the
snowy
tablecloth
the
prettiest
of
little
breakfast
.
<EOS>
in
wait
,
too
,
like
an
attendant
summer
breeze
,
a
fluttering
young
damsel
,
all
pink
and
ribbon
,
blush
as
if
she
have
be
marry
instead
of
Bella
,
and
yet
assert
the
triumph
of
her
sex
over
both
John
and
Pa
,
in
an
exulting
and
exalted
flurry
:
as
who
should
say
,
"
this
be
what
you
must
all
come
to
,
gentleman
,
when
we
choose
to
bring
you
to
book

"
 
<EOS>
this
same
young
damsel
be
Bella
's
serving

maid
,
and
unto
her
do
deliver
a
bunch
of
key
,
command
treasure
in
the
way
of
drysaltery
,
grocery
,
jam
and
pickle
,
the
investigation
of
which
make
pastime
after
breakfast
,
when
Bella
declare
that
"
Pa
must
taste
everything
,
John

or
it
will
never
be
lucky

"
and
when
Pa
have
all
sort
of
thing
poke
into
his
mouth
,
and
do
not
quite
know
what
to
do
with
them
when
they
be
put
there
.
  
<EOS>
then
they
,
all
three
,
out
for
a
charming
ride
,
and
for
a
charming
stroll
among
heath
in
bloom
,
and
there
behold
the
identical
Gruff
and
Glum
with
his
wooden
leg
horizontally
dispose
before
him
,
apparently
sit
meditate
on
the
vicissitude
of
life
!
<EOS>
to
whom
say
Bella
,
in
her
light
-
hearted
surprise
:
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
do
you
do
again
?
<EOS>
what
a
dear
old
pensioner
you
be
!
"
<EOS>
to
which
Gruff
and
Glum
respond
that
he
see
her
marry
this
morning
,
my
Beauty
,
and
that
if
it
warn't
a
liberty
he
wish
her
ji
and
the
fair
of
fair
wind
and
weather
;
<EOS>
further
,
in
a
general
way
request
to
know
what
cheer
?
and
scramble
up
on
his
two
wooden
leg
to
salute
,
hat
in
hand
,
ship
-
shape
,
with
the
gallantry
of
a
man
-
of

warsman
and
a
heart
of
oak
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
pleasant
sight
,
in
the
midst
of
the
golden
bloom
,
to
see
this
salt
old
Gruff
and
Glum
,
wave
his
shovel
hat
at
Bella
,
while
his
thin
white
hair
flow
free
,
as
if
she
have
once
more
launch
him
into
blue
water
again
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
charming
old
pensioner
,
"
say
Bella
,
"
and
I
be
so
happy
that
I
wish
I
could
make
you
happy

too

<EOS>
answer
Gruff
and
Glum
,
"
<EOS>
give
me
leave
to
kiss
your
hand
,
my
Lovely

and
it
be
do
!
"
<EOS>
so
it
be
do
to
the
general
contentment
;
and
if
Gruff
and
Glum
do
not
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
splice
<EOS>
the
main
brace
,
it
be
not
for
want
of
the
mean
of
inflict
that
outrage
on
the
feeling
of
the
Infant
Bands
of
Hope
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
the
marriage
dinner
be
the
crowning
success
,
for
what
have
bride
and
bridegroom
plot
to
do
,
but
to
have
and
to
hold
that
dinner
in
the
very
room
of
the
very
hotel
where
Pa
and
the
lovely
woman
have
once
dine
together
!
<EOS>
Bella
sit
between
Pa
and
John
,
and
divide
her
attention
pretty
equally
,
but
feel
it
necessary
(
in
the
waiter
's
absence
before
dinner
)
to
remind
Pa
that
she
be
his
lovely
woman
no
longer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
well
aware

I

<EOS>
willingly

<EOS>
You

so
I

<EOS>
if
I
think
that
I

but
you
know
you

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
look

"
<EOS>
Bella
put
her
finger
on
her
own
lip
,
and
then
on
Pa
's
,
and
then
on
her
own
lip
again
,

on

<EOS>
now

we
be
a
partnership

Pennsylvania
"
  
the
appearance
of
dinner
here
cut
Bella
short
in
one
of
her
disappearance
:
the
more
effectually
,
because
it
be
put
on
under
the
auspex
of
a
solemn
gentleman
in
black
clothe
and
a
white
cravat
,
who
look
much
more
like
a
clergyman
than
the
clergyman
,
and
seem
to
have
mount
a
great
deal
high
in
the
church
:
not
to
say
,
scale
the
steeple
.
<EOS>
this
dignitary
,
confer
in
secrecy
with
John
Rokesmith
on
the
subject
of
punch
and
wine
,
bend
his
head
as
though
stoop
to
the
papistical
practice
of
receive
auricular
confession
.
<EOS>
likewise
,
on
John
's
offer
a
suggestion
which
do
not
meet
his
view
,
his
face
become
overcast
and
reproachful
,
as
enjoin
penance
.
  
<EOS>
what
a
dinner
!
<EOS>
specimen
of
all
the
fish
that
swim
in
the
sea

surely
have
swum
their
way
to
it

and
if
sample
of
the
fish
of
diver
colour
that
make
a
speech
in
the
Arabian
Nights
(
quite
a
ministerial
explanation
in
respect
of
cloudiness
)
,
and
then
jump
out
of
the
frying
-
pan
,
be
not
to
be
recognize
,
it
be
only
because
they
have
all
become
of
one
hue
by
be
cook
in
batter
among
the
whitebait

<EOS>
and
the
dish
be
season
with
Bliss
---
an
article
which
they
be
sometimes
out
of
,
at
Greenwich
---
be
of
perfect
flavour
,
and
the
golden
drink
have
be
bottle
in
the
golden
age
and
hoard
up
their
sparkle
ever
since

<EOS>
the
good
of
it
be
,
that
Bella
and
John
and
the
cherub
have
make
a
covenant
that
they
would
not
reveal
to
mortal
eye
any
appearance
<EOS>
whatever
of
be
a
wedding
party

<EOS>
now
,
the
supervise

,
the
Archbishop

know
this
as
well
as
if
he
have
perform
the
nuptial
ceremony

and
the
loftiness
with
which
his

enter

and
insist
on
a
show
of
keep
the
waiter
out
of
it
,
be
the
crowning
glory
of
the
entertainment
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
an
innocent
young
waiter
of
a
slender
form
and
with
weakish
leg
,
as
yet
unverse
in
the
wile
of
of
waiterhood
,
and
<EOS>
but
too
evidently
of
a
romantic
temperament
,
and
deeply
(
it
be
not
too
much
to
add
hopelessly
)
in
love
with
some
young
female
not
aware
of
his
merit
.
<EOS>
this
guileless
youth
,
descry
the
position
of
affair
,
which
even
his
innocence
could
not
mistake
,
limit
his
waiting
to
languish
admiringly
against
the
sideboard
when
Bella
do
not
want
anything
,
and
swoop
at
her
when
she
do
.
<EOS>
Him
,
his
grace
the
Archbishop
perpetually
obstruct
,
cut
him
out
with
his
elbow
in
the
moment
of
success
,
despatch
him
in
degrade
quest
of
melted
butter
,
and
,
when
by
any
chance
he
get
hold
of
any
dish
worth
have
,
bereave
him
of
it
,
and
order
him
to
stand
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
pray
excuse
him
,
madam

"
say
the
Archbishop
in
a
low
stately
voice
;
"
he
be
a
very
young
man
on
like
,
and
we
do
not
like
him

"
  
<EOS>
this
induce
John
Rokesmith
to
observe
---
by
way
of
make
the
thing
more
natural
<EOS>
---
"
Bella
,
my
love
,
this
be
so
much
more
successful
than
any
of
our

we
must
keep
our
future
anniversary
here

"
  
<EOS>
Whereunto
Bella
reply
,
with
probably
the
least
successful
attempt
at
look
matronly
that
ever
be
see
:
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
think
so
,
John
,
dear

"
  
<EOS>
here
the
Archbishop
of
Greenwich
cough
a
stately
cough
to
attract
the
attention
of
three
of
his
minister
present
,
and
stare
at
them
,
seem
to
say
:
"
I
call
upon
you
by
your
fealty
to
believe
this
!
"
  
<EOS>
with
his
own
hand
he
afterwards
put
on
the
dessert
,
as
remark
to
the
three
guest

<EOS>
"
the
period

now
arrive
at
which
we
can
dispense
with

assistance

those

and
would
have
retire
with
complete
dignity
but
for
a
daring
action
issue
from
the
misguided
brain
of
the
young
man
on

<EOS>
He
find
,
by
ill

fortune
,
a
piece
of
orange
flower
somewhere
in
the
lobby
now
approach
undetected
with
the

in
a
fingerglass

and
place
it
on
Bella
's
right
hand

<EOS>
the
Archbishop
instantly
eject
and
excommunicate
him
;
but
the
thing
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
trust

return
alone

that
you

murmur

ever
more
so

never
more
so

than
in

through
what
have
pass

<EOS>
He
must
take
the
liberty
of
add
,
that
what
be
true
of
the
mother
be
true
of
the
young
daughter

that
he
could
never
forget
the
touching
feeling
that
the
conduct
of
both
have
awaken
within
him

<EOS>
in
conclusion
,
he
do
hope
that
there
be
not
a
man

remain

away

it
equally
right

avoid
mention

prospect

It
may
seem
like
taunt

let
me
ever
remember
that
I
be
her
young

wound

express
his

<EOS>
I
do
not
ask
you
if
you
be
worthy
of
such
a
wife

put
Me
out

grandeur

I

cross

I
know
I
deserve

you
should
be
very
cross

you
see
I
have
be
such
a
heedless

heartless
creature

have
lead
you
so
to
expect
that
I
should
marry
for
money

so
to
make
sure

I
be
incapable

good

sly

come
to

under
the
constant
necessity
of
refer
for
advice
and
support
to
a
sage
volume
entitle
the
Complete
British
Family
Housewife
,
which
she
would
sit
consulting
,
with
her
elbow
on
the

and
her
temple
on

hand
,
like
some
perplex
enchantress
pore
over
the
Black

<EOS>
this

principally

by
no

an
expert
Briton
at
express
herself
with
clearness
in
the
british
tongue

and
sometimes
may
have
issue
her
direction
to
equal
purpose
in
the
Kamskatchan
language
.
<EOS>
in
any
crisis
of
this
nature
,
Bella
would
suddenly
exclaim
aloud
,
"
oh
you
ridiculous
old
thing

what
do
you
mean
by
that

<EOS>
You
must
have

have
make

marginal
note

try
the

again
,
with
all
her
dimple
screw
into
an
expression
of
profound
research

<EOS>
there
be
likewise
a
coolness
on
the
part
of
the
British
Housewife
,
which
Mrs.
John
Rokesmith
find
highly
exasperating
.
<EOS>
She
would
say
,
"
take
a
salamander
,
"
as
if
a
general
should
command
a
private
to
catch
a
Tartar
.
<EOS>
or
,
she
would
casually
issue
the
order
,
"
throw
in
a
handful

"
of
something
entirely
unattainable
.
<EOS>
in
these
,
the
Housewife
's
most
glaring
moment
of
unreason
,
Bella
would
shut
her
up
and
knock
her
on
the
table
,
apostrophise
her
with
the
compliment
,
"
o
you
   
are
a
stupid
old
donkey

"
  
<EOS>
another
branch
of
study
claim
the
attention
of
Mrs.
John
Rokesmith
for
a
regular
period
every
day
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
mastering
of
the
newspaper
,
so
that
she
may
be
close
up
with
John
on
general
topic
when
John
come
home
.
<EOS>
in
her
desire
to
be
in
all
thing
his
companion

she
would
have
set
herself
with
equal
zeal
to
master
Algebra
,
or
Euclid
,
if
he
have
divide
his
soul
between
her
and
either

<EOS>
wonderful
be
the
way
in
which
she
would
store
up
the
City
Intelligence
,
and
beamingly
shed
it
upon
John
in
the
course
of
the
evening
;
incidentally
mention
the
commodity
that
be
look
up
in
the
market
,
and
how
much
gold
have
be
take
to
the
Bank
,
and
try
to
look
wise
and
serious
over
it
until
she
would
laugh
at
herself
most
charmingly
and
would
say
,
kiss
him
:
"
It
all
come
of
my
love
,
John
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
for
a
city
man
,
John
certainly
do
appear
to
care
as
little
as
may
be
for
the
look
up
or
look
down
of
thing
,
as
well
as
for
the
gold
that
get
take
to
the
Bank

<EOS>
but
he
care
,
beyond
all
expression
,
for
his
wife
,
as
a
most
precious
and
sweet
commodity
that
be
always
look
up
,

that
never
be
worth
less
than
all
the
gold
in

make
amazing

though
,
as
an
endearing

she
make
no
progress
at
all

<EOS>
this
be
her
husband

verdict
,

he
justify
it
by
tell
her
that
she
have
begin
her
married
life
as
the
most
endearing

that
could
possibly

It

sometimes
admonish
him

for

fantastic
as
it

to
make
a
plaything
of
her
good
father

ever
delight
that
she
should
put
him
to
that
account

there
be
an
occasional
something
on
Bella

part
that
be
new

It
could
not
be
say
that
she
be
less
playful

whimsical

natural

than
she
always
have
be
;
but
it
seem
,
her
husband
think
,
as
if
there
be
some
rather
graver
reason
than
he
have
suppose
for
what
she
have
so
lately
say
,
and
as
if
,
throughout
all
this
,
there
be
glimpse
of
an
underlie
seriousness
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
circumstance
in
support
of
this
view
of
the
case
,
that
when
she
have
light
her
father
's
pipe
,
and
mix
him
his
glass
of
grog
,
she
sit
down
on
a
stool
between
her
father

her
husband
,
lean
her
arm
upon
the
latter
,
and
be
very
quiet
.
<EOS>
so
quiet
,
that
when
her
father
rise
to
take
his
leave

she
look
round
with
a
start
,
as
if
she
have
forget
his

there

still
by
the

side

<EOS>
turn
suddenly
,
he
meet
a
man
,
so
close
upon
him
that
Eugene
,
surprised
,
step
back
,
to
avoid
a
collision
.
<EOS>
the
man
carry
something
over
his
shoulder
which
may
have
be
a
broken
oar
,
or
spar
,
or
bar
,
and
take
no
notice
of
him
,
but
pass
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Halloa
,
friend
!
<EOS>
"
say
Eugene
,
call
after
him
,
"
be
you
blind
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
man
make
no
reply
,
but
go
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
Eugene
Wrayburn
go
the
opposite
way
,
with
his
hand
behind
him
and
his
purpose
in
his
thought
.
<EOS>
He
pass
the
sheep
,
and
pass
the
gate
,
and
come
within
hearing
of
the
village
sound
,
and
come
to
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
the
inn
where
he
stay
,
like
the
village
and
the
mill
,
be
not
across
the
river
,
but
on
that
side
of
the
stream
on
which
he
walk
.
<EOS>
however
,
know
the
rushy
bank
and
the
backwater
on
the
other
side
to
be
a
retired
place
,
and
feel
out
of
humour
for
noise
or
company
,
he
cross
the
bridge
,
and
saunter
on
:
look
up
at
the
star
as
they
seem
one
by
one
to
be
kindle
in
the
sky
,
and
look
down
at
the
river
as
the
same
star
seem
to
be
kindle
deep
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
a
land
-
place
overshadow
by
a
willow
,
and
a
pleasure
-
boat
lie
moor
there
among
some
stake
,
catch
his
eye
as
he
pass
along
.
<EOS>
the
spot
be
in
such
dark
shadow
,
that
he
pause
to
make
out
what
be
there
,
and
then
pass
on
again
.
  
<EOS>
the
rippling
of
the
river
seem
to
cause
a
correspondent
stir
in
his
uneasy
reflection
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
lay
them
asleep
if
he
could
,
but
they
be
in
movement
,
like
the
stream
,
and
all
tend
one
way
with
a
strong
current
.
<EOS>
as
the
ripple
under
the
moon
break
unexpectedly
now
and
then
,
and
palely
flash
in
a
new
shape
and
with
a
new
sound
,
so
part
of
his
thought
start
,
<EOS>
unbidden
,
from
the
rest
,
and
reveal
their
wickedness
.
<EOS>
"
out
of
the
question
to
marry
her
,
"
say
Eugene
,
"
and
out
of
the
question
to
leave
her
.
<EOS>
the
crisis
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
saunter
far
enough
.
<EOS>
before
turn
to
retrace
his
step
,
he
stop
upon
the
margin
,
to
look
down
at
the
reflect
night
.
<EOS>
in
an
instant
,
with
a
dreadful
crash
,
the
reflect
night
turn
crooked
,
flame
shoot
jaggedly
across
the
air
,
and
the
moon
and
star
come
burst
from
the
sky
.
  
<EOS>
be
he
strike
by
lightne
?
<EOS>
with
some
incoherent
half
-
form
thought
to
that
effect
,
he
turn
under
the
blow
that
be
blind
him
and
mash
his
life
,
and
close
with
a
murderer
,
whom
he
catch
by
a
red
neckerchief
---
unless
the
raining
down
of
his
own
blood
give
it
that
hue
.
  
<EOS>
Eugene
be
light
,
active
,
and
expert
;
but
his
arm
be
break
,
or
he
be
paralyzed
,
and
could
do
no
more
than
hang
on
to
the
man
,
with
his
head
swing
back
,
so
that
he
could
see
nothing
but
the
heaving
sky
.
<EOS>
after
drag
at
the
assailant
,
he
fall
on
the
bank
with
him
,
and
then
there
be
another
great
crash
,
and
then
a
splash
,
and
all
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
Hexam
,
too
,
have
avoid
the
noise
,
and
the
Saturday
movement
of
people
in
the
straggle
street
,
and
choose
to
walk
alone
by
the
water
until
her
tear
should
be
dry
,
and
she
could
so
compose
herself
as
to
escape
remark
upon
her
look
ill
or
unhappy
on
go
home
.
<EOS>
the
peaceful
serenity
of
the
hour
and
place
,
have
no
reproach
or
evil
intention
within
her
breast
to
contend
against
,
sink
healingly
into
its
depth
.
<EOS>
She
have
meditate
and
take
comfort
.
<EOS>
She
,
too
,
be
turn
homeward
,
when
she
hear
a
strange
sound
.
  
<EOS>
It
startle
her
,
for
it
be
like
a
sound
of
blow
.
<EOS>
She
stand
still
,
and
listen
.
<EOS>
It
sicken
her
,
for
blow
fall
heavily
and
cruelly
on
the
quiet
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
as
she
listen
,
undecided
,
all
be
silent
.
<EOS>
as
she
yet
listen
,
she
hear
a
faint
groan
,
and
a
fall
into
the
river
.
  
<EOS>
Her
old
bold
life
and
habit
instantly
inspire
her
.
<EOS>
without
vain
waste
of
breath
in
cry
for
help
where
there
be
none
to
hear
,
she
run
towards
the
spot
from
which
the
sound
have
come
.
<EOS>
It
lie
between
her
and
the
bridge
,
but
it
be
more
removed
from
her
than
she
have
think
;
the
night
be
so
very
quiet
,
and
sound
travel
far
with
the
help
of
water
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
,
she
reach
a
part
of
the
green
bank
,
much
and
newly
trodden
,
where
there
lie
some
break
splintered
piece
of
wood
and
some
tear
fragment
of
clothe
.
<EOS>
stooping
,
she
see
that
the
grass
be
bloody
.
<EOS>
follow
the
drop
and
smear
,
she
see
that
the
watery
margin
of
the
bank
be
bloody
.
<EOS>
follow
the
current
with
her
eye
,
she
see
a
bloody
face
turn
up
towards
the
moon
,
and
drift
away
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
merciful
Heaven
be
thank
for
that
old
time
,
and
grant
,
o
Blessed
Lord
,
that
through
thy
wonderful
working
it
may
turn
to
good
at
last
!
<EOS>
to
whomsoever
the
drift
face
belong
,
be
it
man
's
or

,
help
my
humble
hand
,
Lord
God
,
to
raise
it
from
death
and
restore
it
to
some
one
to
whom
it
must
be
dear
!
  
<EOS>
It
be
think
,
fervently
think
,
but
not
for
a
moment
do
the
prayer
check
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
away
before
it
well
up
in
her
mind
,
away
,
swift
and
true
,
yet
steady
above
all
---
<EOS>
for
without
steadiness
it
could
never
be
do
---
to
the
landing
-
place
under
the
willow
-
tree
,
where
she
also
have
see
the
boat
lie
moor
among
the
stake
.
  
<EOS>
a
sure
touch
of
her
old
practised
hand
,
a
sure
step
of
her
old
practised
foot
,
a
sure
light
balance
of
her
body
,
and
she
be
in
the
boat
.
<EOS>
a
quick
glance
of
her
practised
eye
show
her
,
even
through
the
deep
dark
shadow
,
the
scull
in
a
rack
against
the
red
-
brick
garden
-
wall
.
<EOS>
another
moment
,
and
she
have
cast
off
(
take
the
line
with
her
)
,
and
the
boat
have
shoot
out
into
the
moonlight
,
and
she
be
row
down
the
stream
as
never
other
woman
row
on
english
water
.
  
<EOS>
intently
over
her
shoulder
,
without
slacken
speed
,
she
look
ahead
for
the
driving
face
.
<EOS>
She
pass
the
scene
of
the
struggle
---
  
yonder
<EOS>
it
be
,
on
her
left
,
well
over
the
boat
's
stern
---
she
pass
on
her
right
,
the
end
of
the
village
street
,
a
hilly
street
that
almost
dip
into
the
river
;
its
sound
be
grow
faint
again
,
and
she
slacken
;
look
as
the
boat
drive
,
everywhere
,
everywhere
,
for
the
floating
face
.
  
<EOS>
She
merely
keep
the
boat
before
the
stream
now
,
and
rest
on
her
oar
,
know
well
that
if
the
face
be
not
soon
visible
,
it
have
go
down
,
and
she
would
overshoot
it
.
<EOS>
an
untrained
sight
would
never
have
see
by
the
moonlight
what
she
see
at
the
length
of
a
few
stroke
astern
.
<EOS>
She
see
the
drown
figure
rise
to
the
surface
,
slightly
struggle
,
and
as
if
by
instinct
turn
over
on
its
back
to
float
.
<EOS>
just
so
have
she
first
dimly
see
the
face
which
she
now
dimly
see
again
.
  
<EOS>
firm
of
look
and
firm
of
purpose
,
she
intently
watch
its
come
on
,
until
it
be
very
near
;
then
,
with
a
touch
unship
her
scull
,
and
creep
aft
in
the
boat
,
between
kneel
and
crouching
.
<EOS>
once
,
she
let
the
body
evade
her
,
not
be
sure
of
her
grasp
.
<EOS>
twice
,
and
she
have
seize
it
by
its
bloody
hair
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
insensible
,
if
not
virtually
dead
;
it
be
mutilate
,
and
streak
the
water
all
about
it
with
dark
red
streak
.
<EOS>
as
it
could
not
help
itself
,
it
be
impossible
for
her
to
get
it
on
board
.
<EOS>
She
bend
over
the
stern
to
secure
it
with
the
line
,
and
then
the
river
and
its
shore
ring
to
the
terrible
cry
she
utter
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
as
if
possess
by
supernatural
spirit
and
strength
,
she
lash
it
safe
,
resume
her
seat
,
and
row
in
,
desperately
,
for
the
near
shallow
water
where
she
may
run
the
boat
aground
.
<EOS>
desperately
,
but
not
wildly
,
for
she
know
that
if
she
lose
distinctness
of
intention
,
all
be
lose
and
go
.
  
<EOS>
She
run
the
boat
ashore
,
go
into
the
water
,
release
him
from
the
line
,
and
by
main
strength
lift
him
in
her
arm
and
lay
him
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
.
<EOS>
He
have
fearful
wound
upon
him
,
and
she
bind
them
up
with
her
dress
tear
into
strip
.
<EOS>
else
,
suppose
him
to
be
still
alive
,
she
foresee
that
he
must
bleed
to
death
before
he
could
be
land
at
his
inn
,
which
be
the
near
place
for
succour
.
  
<EOS>
this
do
very
rapidly
,
she
kiss
his
disfigure
forehead
,
look
up
in
anguish
to
the
star
,
and
bless
him
and
forgave
him
,
"
if
she
have
anything
to
forgive
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
only
in
that
instant
that
she
think
of
herself
,
and
then
she
think
of
herself
only
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
merciful
Heaven
be
thank
for
that
old
time
,
enable
me
,
without
a
waste
moment
,
to
have
get
the
boat
afloat
again
,
and
to
row
back
against
the
stream
!
<EOS>
and
grant
,
o
Blessed
Lord
God
,
that
through
poor
me
he
may
be
raise
from
death
,
and
preserve
to
some
one
else
to
whom
he
may
be
dear
one
day
,
though
never
dearer
than
to
me

<EOS>
She
row
hard
---
row
desperately
,
but
never
wildly
---
and
seldom
remove
her
eye
from
him
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
.
<EOS>
She
have
so
lay
him
there
,
as
that
she
may
see
his
disfigured
face
;
it
be
so
much
disfigure
that
his
mother
may
have
cover
it
,
but
it
be
above
and
beyond
disfigurement
in
her
eye

<EOS>
She
make
the
boat
fast
,
and
again
by
main
strength
take
him
up
,

never
lay
him
down

how
doctor
would
lift
the
hand
of
an
insensible
wound
person

would
drop
it
if

<EOS>
She
wait
for
the
awful
moment
when
the
doctor
may
lift
this
hand
,
all
break
and
bruise
,
and
let
it
fall

<EOS>
the

his
examination

I
be

I
do

<EOS>
the
surgeon
look
at
her
with
great
attention
,
and
with
some
compassion
.
<EOS>
have
with
a
grave
face
touch
the
wound
upon
the
head
,
and
the
broken
arm
,
he
take
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
would
he
let
it
drop
?
  
<EOS>
He
appear
irresolute
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
retain
it
,
but
lay
it
gently
down
,
take
a
candle
,
look
more
closely
at
the
injury
on
the
head
,
and
at
the
pupil
of
the
eye
.
<EOS>
that
do

he
replace
the
candle
and
take
the
hand
again

another

come
in

the
two
exchange
a
whisper
,
and
the
second
take
the
hand

<EOS>
neither
do
he
let
it
fall
at
once

keep
it
for
a
while
and
lay
it
gently
down

"

poor

<EOS>
Bradley
's
face
turn
so
dark
on
this
hint
,
that
Riderhood
deem
it
expedient
to
soften
it
into
a
compliment
.

"
<EOS>
but
not
you

not

for
what

to

with

of

"
  
very
remarkably
,
Riderhood
put
no
question
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
look
at
him
on
open
the
door
,
and
he
now
look
at
him
again
(
stealthily
this
time
)
,
and
the
result
of
his
looking
be
,
that
he
ask
him
no

"
You
will
be

Riderhood
,
when
his
visitor
sit
down
,
rest
his
chin
on
his
hand
,
with
his
eye
on
the
ground

<EOS>
and
very
remarkably
again
:
riderhood
feign
to
set
the
scanty
furniture
in
order
,
while
he
speak

to
have
a
show
of
reason

Mr.
Riderhood
get
out
his
bottle
,
and
fetch
his
jug

full
of
water
,

administer
a
potation

then
,
he
shake
the
coverlet
of

spread
it
smooth
,
and
Bradley
stretch
himself
upon
it
in
the
clothe
he

<EOS>
Mr.

poetically
remark
that
he
would
pick
the
bone
of

night
's
rest

in

he
rise

close

in

bright
daylight

on

with
great
minuteness

He

the
formality
of
spread
a
tablecloth
not
be
observe
in
Mr.
Riderhood
's
establishment
,
the
serving
of
the
"
peck
"
be
the
affair
of
a
moment
;
it
merely
consist
in
the
handing
down
of
a
capacious
baking
dish
with
three
-
fourth
of
an
immense
meat
pie
in

and
the
production
of
two
pocket

knife
,
an
earthenware
mug
,
and
a
large
brown
bottle
of
beer
.
  
<EOS>
both
ate
and
drank
,
but
Riderhood
much
the
more
abundantly
.
<EOS>
in
lieu
of
plate
,
that
honest
man
cut
two
triangular
piece
from
the
thick
crust
of
the
pie
,
and
lay
them
,
inside
uppermost
,
upon
the
table
:
the
one
before
himself
,
and
the
other
before
his
guest
.
<EOS>
upon
these
platter
he
place
two
goodly
portion
of
the
content
of
the
pie
,
thus
impart
the
unusual
interest
to
the
entertainment
that
each
partaker
scoop
out
the
inside
of
his
plate
,
and
consume
it
with
his
other
fare
,
besides
have
the
sport
of
pursue
the
clot
of
congealed
gravy
over
the
plain
of
the
table

and
successfully
take
them
into
his
mouth
at

from

blade

knife

<EOS>
Bradley
Headstone
be
so
remarkably
awkward
at
these
exercise

that
the
Rogue
observe
it

<EOS>
"
look
out

cry
,

cut

<EOS>
but
,
the
caution
come
too
late
,
for
Bradley
gash
it
at
the
instant
.
<EOS>
and
,
what
be
more
unlucky
,
in
ask
Riderhood
to
tie
it
up
,
and
in
stand
close
to
him
for
the
purpose
,
he
shake
his
hand
under
the
smart
of

wound

shake
blood
over

dress

when

remain

congeal
gravy
have
be
put
back
into
what
remain

serve
as
an
economical
investment
for
all
miscellaneous
saving
,
Riderhood
fill
the
mug
with
beer
and
take
a
long
drink
.
<EOS>
and
now
he
do
look
at

with
an
evil
eye

feint
away

up

"
  
<EOS>
the
convulsive
twitching
of
Bradley
Headstone
's
face
,
and
the
sudden
hot
humour
that
break
out
upon
it
,
show
how
grimly
the
intelligence
touch
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
say
not
a
single
word
,
good
or
bad
.
<EOS>
He
only
smile
in
a
lower
manner
,
and
get
up
and
stand
lean
at
the
window
,
look
through
it
.
<EOS>
riderhood
follow
him
with
his
eye
.
<EOS>
riderhood
cast
down
his
eye
on
his
own
besprinkle
clothe
.
<EOS>
riderhood
begin
to
have
an
air
of
be
well
at
a
guess
than
Bradley
own
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
so
long
in
want
of
rest
,
"
say
the
school
-
master
,
"
that
with
your
leave
I
will
lie
down
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
welcome
,
t'other

<EOS>
"
be
the
hospitable
answer
of
his
host
.
<EOS>
He
have
lay
himself
down
without
wait
for
it
,
and
he
remain
upon
the
bed
until
the
sun
be
low
.
<EOS>
when
he
arise
and
come
out
to
resume
his
journey
,
he
find
his
host
wait
for
him
on
the
grass
by
the
towing
-
path
outside
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
whenever
it
may
be
necessary
that
you

I
should
have
any
further
communication
together

Bradley
,
"
I
will
come
back

good
-
night

"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
since
no
better
can
be

say
Riderhood
,
turn
on
his
heel
,
"
good
-
night

<EOS>
"
but
he
turn
again
as
the
other
set
forth
,
and
add
under
his
breath
,
look
after
him
with
a
leer
:
"
You
would
not
be
let
to
go
like
that
,
if
my
relief
warn't
<EOS>
as
good
as
come
.
<EOS>
I
will
catch
you
up
in
a
mile
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
his
real
time
of
relief
be
that
evening
at
sunset
,
his
mate
come
lounge
in
,
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
<EOS>
not
stay
to
fill
up
the
utmost
margin
of
his
time
,
but
borrow
an
hour
or
so
,
to
be
repay
again
when
he
should
relieve
his
reliever
,
Riderhood
straightway
follow
on
the
track
of
Bradley
Headstone
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
well
follower
than
Bradley
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
the
calling
of
his
life
to
slink
and
skulk
and
dog
and
waylay
,
and
he
know
his
calling
well
.
<EOS>
He
effect
such
a
force
march
on
leave
the
Lock
House
that
he
be
close
up
with
him
---
that
be
to
say
,
as
close
up
with
him
as
he
deem
it
convenient
to
be
---
before
another
Lock
be
pass
.
<EOS>
His
man
look
back
pretty
often
as
he
go
,
but
get
no
hint
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
know
how
to
take
advantage
of
the
ground
,
and
where
to
put
the
hedge
between
them
,
and
where
the
wall
,
and
when
to
duck
,
and
when
to
drop
,
and
have
a
thousand
art
beyond
the
doom
Bradley
's
slow
conception
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
all
his
art
be
bring
to
a
standstill
,
like
himself
,
when
Bradley
,
turn
into
a
green
lane
or
riding
by
the
river
-
side
---
a
solitary
spot
run
wild
in
nettle
,
briar
,
and
bramble
,
and
encumber
with
the
scathed
trunk
of
a
whole
hedgerow
of
fell
tree
,
on
the
outskirt
of
a
little
wood
---
begin
step
on
these
trunk
and
drop
down
among
them
and
step
on
them
again
,
apparently
as
a
schoolboy
may
have
do
,
but
assuredly
with
no
schoolboy
purpose
,
or
want
of
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
up
to
?
"
<EOS>
mutter
Riderhood
,
down
in
the
ditch
,
and
hold
the
hedge
a
little
open
with
both
hand
.
<EOS>
and
soon
his
action
make
a
most
extraordinary
reply
.
"
<EOS>
by
George
and
the
Draggin
!
"
<EOS>
cry
riderhood
,
"
if
he
be
not
a
going
to
bathe
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
pass
back
,
on
and
among
the
trunk
of
tree
again
,
and
have
pass
on
to
the
water
-
side
and
have
begin
undress
on
the
grass
.
<EOS>
for
a
moment
it
have
a
suspicious
look
of
suicide
,
arrange
to
counterfeit
accident
.
<EOS>
"
but
you
would
not
have
fetch
a
bundle
under
your
arm
,
from
among
that
timber
,
if
such
be
your
game
!
"
say
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
it
be
a
relief
to
him
when
the
bather
after
a
plunge
and
a
few
stroke
come
out
.
<EOS>
"
for
I
should
not
,
"
he
say
in
a
feeling
manner
,
"
have
like
to
lose
you
till
I
have
make
more
money
out
of
you
neither
.
"
  
<EOS>
Prone
in
another
ditch
(
he
have
change
his
ditch
as
his
man
have
change
his
position
)
,
and
hold
apart
so
small
a
patch
of
the
hedge
that
the
sharp
eye
could
not
have
detect
him
,
Rogue
Riderhood
watch
the
bather
dressing
.
<EOS>
and
now
gradually
come
the
wonder
that
he
stand
up
,
completely
clothe
,
another
man
,
and
not
the
Bargeman
.
  
<EOS>
"
aha
!
"
say
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
much
as
you
be
dress
that
night
.
<EOS>
I
see
.
<EOS>
You
be
a
take
me
with
you
,
now
.
<EOS>
You
be
deep
.
<EOS>
but
I
know
a
deep
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
the
bather
have
finish
dress
,
he
kneel
on
the
grass
,
do
something
with
his
hand
,
and
again
stand
up
with

it

perhaps
he
have
take
the

to

first

through

long
laborious

perhaps
through

year
he
have
find
his
drudgery
lighten
by
communication
with
a
bright

more
apprehensive
spirit

his

perhaps
a

resemblance

smote

he

there

with

the

therefore

at

foreshadowing

whine

sit
shake

it
be
always
on

scarecrow

he
have
betray
his
sharp
parent
for
sixty
threepennyworth

be
all
go

that
her
sharpness
would
infallibly
detect
his

it

sooner

all
thing
consider
therefore
,
and
addition
make
of
the
state
of
his
body
to
the
state

the
bed
on

the

I
always
see

the
old
man
when
satisfied
that
no
inconvenience
could
be
entail
on
any
one
by
his
compliance
,
readily
comply
;
and
the
singularly
-
assort
couple
once
more
go
through
the
street
together
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
the
bad
child
have
be
strictly
charge
by
his
parent
to
remain
at
home
in
her
absence
,
of
course
go
out
;
and
,
be
in
the
very
last
stage
of
mental
decrepitude
,
go
out
with
two
object
;
 
firstly
,
to
establish
a
claim
he
conceive
himself
to
have
upon
any
licensed
victualler
living
,
to
be
supply
with
threepennyworth
of
rum
for
nothing
;
and
secondly
,
to
bestow
some
maudlin
remorse
on
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
,
and
see
what
profit
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
stumblingly
pursue
these
two
design
---
they
both
mean
rum
,
the
only
meaning
of
which
he
be
capable
---
the
degrade
creature
stagger
into
Covent
Garden
Market
and
there
bivouac
,
to
have
an
attack
of
the
tremble
succeed
by
an
attack
of
the
horror
,
in
a
doorway
.
  
<EOS>
this
market
of
Covent
Garden
be
quite
out
of
the
creature
's
line
of
road
,
but
it
have
the
attraction
for
him
which
it
have
for
the
bad
of
the
solitary
member
of
the
drunken
tribe
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
the
companionship
of
the
nightly
stir
,
or
it
may
be
the
companionship
of
the
gin
and
beer
that
slop
about
among
carter
and
huckster
,
or
it
may
be
the
companionship
of
the
trodden
vegetable
refuse
which
be
so
like
their
own
dress
that
perhaps
they
take
the
market
for
a
great
wardrobe
;
but
be
it
<EOS>
what
it
may
,
you
shall
see
no
such
individual
drunkard
on
doorstep
anywhere
,
as
there
.
<EOS>
of
doze
woman
-
drunkard
especially
,
you
shall
come
upon
such
specimen
there
,
in
the
morning
sunlight
,
as
you
may
seek
out
of
door
in
vain
through
London
.
<EOS>
such
stale
vapid
reject
cabbage

leaf

such
damage

orange
countenance

such
squash
pulp
of
humanity
,
be
open
to
the
day
nowhere
else
.
<EOS>
so
,
the
attraction
of
the
market
draw
Mr.
Dolls
to
it
,
and
he
have
out
his
two
fit
of
tremble
and
horror
in
a
doorway
on
which
a
woman
have
have
out
her
sodden
nap
a
few
hour
before
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
swarm
of
young
savage
always
flit
about
this
same
place
,
creep
off
with
fragment
of
orange

chest
,
and
mouldy
litter
---
Heaven
know
into
what
hole
they
can
convey
them
,
have
no
home
!
---
whose
bare
foot
fall
with
a
blunt
dull
softness
on
the
pavement
as
the
policeman
hunt
them
,
and
who
be
(
perhaps
for
that
reason
)
<EOS>
little
hear
by
the
Powers
that
be
,
whereas
in
topboot
they
would
make
a
deafen
clatter
.
<EOS>
these
,
delight
in
the
tremble
and
the
horror
of
Mr.
Dolls
,
as
in
a
gratuitous
drama
,
flock
about
him
in
his
doorway
,
butt
at
him
,
leap
at
him
,
and
pelt
him
.
<EOS>
hence
,
when
he
come
out
of
his
invalid
retirement
and
shake
off
that
ragged
train
,
he
be
much
bespatter
,
and
in
bad
case
than
ever
.
<EOS>
but
,
not
yet
at
his
bad
;
for
,
go
into
a
public

house

and
be
supply
in
stress
of
business
with
his
rum

and

<EOS>
this
application
superinduce
another
fit
of
the
tremble
;
after
which
Mr.

as
find
himself
in
good

a
call
on
a
professional

address
himself
to

It

not

off

when

we
will
have
a
cup
of
tea

chat
over
future
arrangement

<EOS>
It
be
a
very
plain
last
house
that
I
have
be
able
to
give
my
poor
unfortunate

he
will
accept
the
will
for
the
deed

her
eye

why

it
will
not

to
him

<EOS>
I
see
the
service
in
the
Prayer

book
say
,
that
we
bring
nothing
into

it

certain
we
can
take
nothing
out

It
comfort
me
for
not

able
to
hire
a
lot
of
stupid
undertaker

thing
for

seem
as
if
I
be
try

smuggle
'em
out
of

him

course
I
must
break
down
in

'em
all
back
again

it

there
will

dressmaker
<EOS>
discover
<EOS>
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
a
darkened
and
hushed
room
;
the
river
outside
the
window
flow
on
to
the
vast
ocean
;
a
figure
on
the
bed
,
swathe
and
bandage
and
bind
,
lie
helpless
on
its
back
,
with
its
two
useless
arm
in
splint
at
its
side
.
<EOS>
only
two
day
of
usage
so
familiarize
the
little
dressmaker
with
this
scene
,
that
it
hold
the
place
occupy
two
day
ago
by
the
recollection
of
year
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
scarcely
move
since
her
arrival
.
<EOS>
sometimes
his
eye
be
open
,
sometimes
closed
.
<EOS>
when
they
be
open
,
there
be
no
meaning
in
their
unwinking
stare
at
one
spot
straight
before
them
,
unless
for
a
moment
the
brow
knit
into
a
faint
expression
of
anger
,
or
surprise
.
<EOS>
then
,
Mortimer
Lightwood
would
speak
to
him
,
and
on
occasion
he
would
be
so
far
rouse
as
to
make
an
attempt
to
pronounce
his
friend
's
name
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
an
instant
consciousness
be
go
again
,
and
no
spirit
of
Eugene
be
in
Eugene
's
crush
outer
form
.
  
<EOS>
They
provide
Jenny
with
material
for
ply
her
work
,
and
she
have
a
little
table
place
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
.
<EOS>
sit
there
,
with
her
rich
shower
of
hair
fall
over
the
chair
-
back
,
they
hope
she
may
attract
his
notice
.
<EOS>
with
the
same
object
,
she
would
sing
,
just
above
her
breath
,
when
he
open
his
eye
,
or
she
see
his
brow
knit
into
that
faint
expression
,
so
evanescent
that
it
be
like
a
shape
make
in
water
.
<EOS>
but
as
yet
he
have
not
heed
.
<EOS>
the
"
they

here
mention
,
be
the
medical
attendant
;
Lizzie
,
who
be
there
in
all
her
interval
of
rest
;
and
Lightwood
,
who
never
leave
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
day
become
three
,
and
the
three
day
become
four
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
quite
unexpectedly
,
he
say
something
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
,
my
dear
eugene
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you

"
Will

"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
fellow
,
she
be
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
quite
unconscious
of
the
long
blank
,
he
suppose
that
they
be
still
speak
together
.
  
<EOS>
the
little
dressmaker
stand
up
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
hum
her
song
,
and
nod
to
him
brightly
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
shake
hand
,
Jenny
,
"
 
say
Eugene
,
with
something
of
his
old
look
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
be
very
glad
to
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mortimer
repeat
this
to
her
,
for
it
could
only
be
make
out
by
bend
over
him
and
closely
watch
his
attempt
to
say
it
.
<EOS>
in
a
little
while
,
he
add
:
  
"
<EOS>
ask
her
if
she
have
see
the
child
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mortimer
could
not
understand
this
,
neither
could
Jenny
herself
,
until
he
add
:
  
<EOS>
"
ask
her
if
she
have
smell
the
flower
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
I
know
!
"
cry
Jenny
.
<EOS>
"
I
understand
him
now
!
"
<EOS>
then
,
Lightwood
yield
his
place
to
her
quick
approach
,
and
she
say
,
bend
over
the
bed
,
with
that
well
look
:
"
<EOS>
You
mean
my
long
bright
slant
row
of
child

who
use
to
bring
me
ease
and
rest

You

the
child

take
me
up
,
and
make
me
light

"
  
Eugene
smile
,
"
yes

"
  
"
I
have
not

I
never

but
I
be
hardly
ever
in
pain
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
pretty
fancy
,
"
say
Eugene
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
have
hear
my
bird
sing
,
"
cry
the
little
creature
,
"
and
I
have
smell
my
flower
.
<EOS>
yes
,
indeed
I
have

<EOS>
and
both
be
most
beautiful
and
most
divine

"
  
<EOS>
"
stay
and
help
to
nurse
me

say
Eugene
,
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
you

the
fancy
here
,
before
I
die

"
  
<EOS>
She
touch
his
lip
with
her
hand
,
and
shade
her
eye
with
that
same
hand
as
she
go
back
to
her
work
and
her
little
low
song
.
<EOS>
He
hear
the
song
with
evident
pleasure
,
until
she
allow
it
gradually
to
sink
away
into
silence

<EOS>
Mortimer
give
him
such
stimulant
as
could
be
give
him
with
safety
(
they
be
always
at
hand
,
ready

,
and
bend
over
him
once
more

be
about

caution
him

He
see
in

add
after
a
moment
:

Eugene
with
a

break

indistinct

by
a
great
effort
he

<EOS>
in
the
act
of
turn
his
eye
gratefully
towards
his
friend
,
he
wander
away
.
<EOS>
His
eye
stand
still
,
and
settle
into
that
former
intent
unmeaning
stare
.
  
<EOS>
hour
and
hour
,
day
and
night
<EOS>
,
he
remain
in
this
same
condition
.
<EOS>
there
be
time
when
he
would
calmly
speak
to
his
friend
after
a
long
period
of
unconsciousness
,
and
would
say
he
be
well
,
and
would
ask
for
something
.
<EOS>
before
it
could
be
give
him
,
he
would
be
go
again
.
  
<EOS>
the
doll
'
dressmaker
,
all
soften
compassion
now
,
watch
him
with
an
earnestness
that
never
relaxed
.
<EOS>
She
would
regularly
change
the
ice
,
or
the
cool
spirit
,
on
his
head
,
and
would
keep
her
ear
at
the
pillow
between
while
,
listen
for
any
faint
word
that
fall
from
him
in
his
wandering
.
<EOS>
It
be
amazing
through
how
many
hour
at
a
time
she
would
remain
beside
him
,
in
a
crouch
attitude
,
attentive
to
his
slight
moan
.
<EOS>
as
he
could
not
move
a
hand
,
he
could
make
no
sign
of
distress
;
but
,
through
this
close
watch
(
if
through
no
secret
sympathy
or
power
)
the
little
creature
attain
an
understanding
of
him
that
Lightwood
do
not
possess
.
<EOS>
Mortimer
would
often
turn
to
her
,
as
if
she
be
an
interpreter
between
this
sentient
world
and
the
insensible
man
;
and
she
would
change
the
dressing
of
a
wound
,
or
ease
a
ligature
,
or
turn
his
face
,
or
alter
the
pressure
of
the
bedclothe
on
him
,
with
an
absolute
certainty
of
do
right
.
<EOS>
the
natural
lightness
and
delicacy
of
touch
which
have
become
very
refined
by
practice
in
her
miniature
work
,
no
doubt
be
involve
in
this
;
but
her
perception
be
at
least
as
fine
.
  
<EOS>
the
one
word
,
Lizzie
,
he
mutter
million
of
time
.
<EOS>
in
a
certain
phase
of
his
distressful
state
,
which
be
the
bad
to
those
who
tend
him
,
he
would
roll
his
head
upon
the
pillow
,
incessantly
repeat
the
name
in
a
hurried
and
impatient
manner
,
with
the
misery
of
a
disturbed
mind
,
and
the
monotony
of
a
machine
.
<EOS>
equally
,
when
he
lie
still
and
stare
,
he
would
repeat
it
for
hour
without
cessation
,
but
then
,
always
in
a
tone
of
subdued
warning
and
horror
.
<EOS>
Her
presence
and
her
touch
upon
his
breast
or
face
would
often
stop
this
,
and
then
they
learn
to
expect
that
he
would
for
some
time
remain
still
,
with
his
eye
closed
,
and
that
he
would
be
conscious
on
open
them
.
<EOS>
but
,
the
heavy
disappointment
of
their
hope
---
revive
by
the
welcome
silence
of
the
room
---
be
,
that
his
spirit
would
glide
away
again
and
be
lose
,
in
the
moment
of
their
joy
that
it
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
this
frequent
rise
of
a
drown
man
from
the
deep
,
to
sink
again
,
be
dreadful
to
the
beholder
.
<EOS>
but
,
gradually
the
change
steal
upon
him
that
it
become
dreadful
to
himself
.
<EOS>
His
desire
to
impart
something
that
be
on
his
mind
,
his
unspeakable
yearning
to
have
speech
with
his
friend
and
make
a
communication
to
him
,
so
trouble
him
when
he
recover
consciousness
,
that
its
term
be
thereby
shorten
.
<EOS>
as
the
man
rise
from
the
deep
would
disappear
the
sooner
for
fighting
with
the
water
,
so
he
in
his
desperate
struggle
go
down
again
.
  
<EOS>
one
afternoon
when
he
have
be
lie
still
,
and
Lizzie
,
unrecognized
,
have
just
steal
out
of
the
room
to
pursue
her
occupation
,
he
utter
Lightwood
's
name
.
  
<EOS>
"

dear

from

they

they

such

the

Margaretta
his

with

Mortimer

be
already
in

<EOS>
that
worthy
couple
be
delay
by
a
portentous
old
parishioner
of
the
female
gender

who
be
one
of
the
plague

with
whom
they

She

by
conspicuously
weep
at
everything

however
cheer
,
<EOS>
say
by
the
Reverend
Frank
in
his
public
ministration
;
 
also
by
apply
to
herself
the
various
lamentation
of
David
,
and
complain
in
a
personally
injure
manner
(
much
in
arrear
of
the
clerk
and
the
rest
of
the
respondent
)
that
her
enemy
be
dig
pit

fall
about

break
her
with
rod

<EOS>
indeed
,
this
old

discharge
herself
of

lodge
a

apply

but
this
be
not
her
most
inconvenient
characteristic

for
that
take
the
form
of
an
impression

usually
recur
in
inclement
weather
and
at
about
daybreak
,
that
she
have
something
on
her
mind
and
stand
in
immediate
need
of
the
Reverend
Frank
to
come
and
take
it
off
.
<EOS>
many
a
time
have
that
kind
creature
get
up
,
and
go
out
to
Mrs.
Sprodgkin
(
such
be
the
disciple
's
name
)
,
suppress
a
strong
sense
of
her
comicality
by
his
strong
sense
of
duty

perfectly
know
that
nothing

a
cold
would
come
of
it

<EOS>
however
,
beyond
themselves
,
the
Reverend
Frank
Milvey
and
Mrs.
Milvey
seldom
hint
that
Mrs.
Sprodgkin
be
hardly
worth
the
trouble
she
give
;
but
both
make
the
good
of
her
,
as
they
do
of
all
their
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
this
very
exact
member

appear
to
be
endow
with
a
sixth

in

of
know
when
the
Reverend
Frank
Milvey
least
desire
her
company
,

with
promptitude
appear
in
his
little
hall

<EOS>
consequently
,
when
the
Reverend
Frank
have
willingly
engage
that
he

his

would
accompany
Lightwood
back

he
say
,
as
a
matter

to
which
Mrs.

the
point
on
which
Mrs.

seek
elucidation

seldom
of
a
press
nature
(
<EOS>
as
who
beget
Whom
,
or
some
information
concern
the
Amorites

,
Mrs.
Milvey
on
this
special
occasion
resort
to
the
device
of
buy
her
off
with
a
present
of
tea

sugar

a

<EOS>
these

curtsey
to
the
Reverend

"
<EOS>
involve
himself
in
a
discursive
address
from
Mrs.

revolve
around
the
result
that
she
regard
tea
and
sugar
in
the
light
of
myrrh
and
frankincense
,
and
consider
bread
and
butter
identical
with
locust

wild
honey

<EOS>
have
communicate
this
edify
piece
of
information

Mrs.

unadjourned
in

and
Mr.

Mrs.

hurry
in
a
heated
condition
to
the
railway
station

<EOS>
all
of
which
be
here

honor

good
christian

merge
the

incomprehensible

take
no

Mrs.

add

take
thought
for

she
be

oh
yes

detain
at

<EOS>
but
as
to
the
claim
,
Frank
,
I
must
say
that
I
do
think
you
be
over
-
considerate
sometimes
,
and
allow
that
to
be
a
little
abused
.

"
  
<EOS>
Bella
feel
conscious
,
in
spite
of
her
late
pledge
for
herself
,
that
her
husband
's
absence
would
give
disagreeable
occasion
for
surprise
to
the
Milveys

nor
could
she
appear
quite
at
her
ease

ask

how
be
Mr.

be
he
go
before

do
he
follow
us

It
become
necessary

upon

to
send
him
to

again

hold
him
in

be
lance
again
,
Bella
do
it

not
half
as
well
on
the
second

on
the
first

a
twice

tell
white
one
seem
almost
to
become
a
black
one

"

say
Mrs.

,
"
I
be
so
sorry

<EOS>
Mr.

take
such
an
interest
in
Lizzie
Hexam

when

there
before

only
know

we
could
have
give
him
something

keep
it
down
long

short
a

by
way

make

whiter

He

They
take
their
seat

begin

furiously

Would

the
gentleman

so

with
the
explanation

a
man
of

very
respectable
occupation

out

slide
down

then
,
the
train
rattle
among
the
house

top

and
among
the
ragged
side
of
house
tear
down
to
make
way
for
it

and
over
the
swarm
street
,
and
under
the
fruitful
earth
,
until
it
shoot
across
the
river
:
burst
over
the
quiet
surface
like
a
bomb

shell
,
and
go
again
as
if

explode
in
the
rush
of

steam
and
glare
.
<EOS>
a
little
more
,
and
again
it
roar
across
the
river
,
a
great
rocket
:
spurn
the
watery
turning
and
doubling
with
ineffable
contempt
,
and
go
straight
to
its
end
,
as
Father
Time
go

to

high

reflect
the
heavenly

produce
their
little
growth
of
weed

here
,
turn
there

noisy

be
troubled

at

one
sure
termination

though
their
source

device
be
many

<EOS>
then
,
a
carriage
ride
succeed
,
near
the
solemn
river
,
steal
away
by
night
,
as
all

steal
away
,
by
night
and
by
day
,
so
quietly
yield
to
the
attraction
of
the
loadstone
rock
of
Eternity
;
and
the
nearer
they
draw
to
the
chamber
where
Eugene
lie
,
the
more
they
fear
that
they
may
find
his
wandering
do
.
<EOS>
at
last
they
see
its
dim
light
shine
out
,
and
it
give
them
hope
:
though
Lightwood
falter
as
he
think
:
"
if
he
be
go
,
she
would
still
be
sit
by
him

he
lie
quiet

half
in
stupor
,
half
in
sleep

<EOS>
Bella
,
enter
with
a
raise
admonitory
finger
,
kiss
Lizzie
softly
,
but
say
not
a
word

<EOS>
neither
do
any
of

but
all
sit
down
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
silently
wait
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
in
this
night
-
watch
,
mingle
with
the
flow
of
the
river
and
with
the
rush
of
the
train
,
come
the
question
into
Bella
's
mind
again
:
<EOS>
what
could
be
in
the
depth
of
that
mystery
of
John
's
?
<EOS>
why
be
it
that
he
have
never
be
see
by
Mr.
Lightwood
,
whom
he
still
avoid
?
<EOS>
when
would
that
trial
come
,
through
which
her
faith
in

and
her
duty
to

her
dear
husband
,
be
to
carry
her
,
render
him
triumphant
?
<EOS>
for
,
that
have
be
his
term
.
<EOS>
Her
passing
through
the
trial
be
to
make
the
man
she
love
with
all
her
heart
,
triumphant
.
<EOS>
term
not
to
sink
out
of
sight
in
Bella
's
breast
.
  
<EOS>
far
on
in
the
night
,
Eugene
open
his
eye
.
<EOS>
He
be
sensible
,
and
say
at
once
:
"
how
do
the
time
go
?
<EOS>
have
our
Mortimer
come
back
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lightwood
be
there
immediately
,
to
answer
for
himself
.
"
<EOS>
yes
,
Eugene
,
and
all
be
ready
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
dear
boy

"
return
Eugene
with
a
smile
,
"
we
both
thank
you
heartily
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
tell
them
how
welcome
they
be
,
and
that
I
would
be
eloquent

"
  
<EOS>
"
there

Mr.

"
  
<EOS>
Eugene
turn
his
eye
towards
Lizzie
,
as
if
to
spare
her
,
and
answer
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
they
all
stand
around
the
bed
,
and
Mr.
Milvey
,
open
his
book
,
begin
the
service
;
so
rarely
associate
with
the
shadow
of
death
;
so
inseparable
in
the
mind
from

flush
of

gaiety
and
hope

and
bend
over
Eugene

who
keep
his
eye
upon
him
,
Mr.
Milvey
do
his
office
with
suitable
simplicity
.
<EOS>
as
the
bridegroom
could
not
move
his
hand
,
they
touch
his
finger
with
the
ring
,
and
so
put
it
on
the
bride
.
<EOS>
when
the
two
plight
their
troth

she
lay
her
hand
on

there

<EOS>
when

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
"

"
the

"

<EOS>
You

You
heroine

"
  
<EOS>
Her
own
eye
fill
under
his
praise
.
<EOS>
and
when
he
muster
strength
to
move
his
wounded
head
a
very
little
way
,
and
lie
it
on
her
bosom
,
the
tear
of
both
fall
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
,
"
say
Eugene
,
after
a
silence
:
"
when
you
see
me
wander
away
from
this
refuge
that
I
have
so
ill
deserved

speak
to
me
by

I
think
I
shall
come
back

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
there

he
exclaim

smile

<EOS>
"
I
should
have
go
then

for
that

<EOS>
a
little
while
afterwards
,
when
he
appear
to
be
sink
into
insensibility

in
a
calm
loving

He
immediately
answer
:
"
there
again
!
<EOS>
You
see
how
you
can
recall
me
!
"
<EOS>
and
afterwards
,
when
he
could
not
speak
,
he
still
answer
by
a
slight
movement
of
his
head
upon
her
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
the
sun
be
high
in
the
sky
,
when
she
gently
disengage
herself
to
give
him

stimulant
and
nourishment

require

utter
helplessness
of
the
wreck

lie
cast
ashore
there

now
alarm
her

he
himself
appear
a
little
more
hopeful

<EOS>
"
ah
,
my
beloved
Lizzie
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
faintly
.
<EOS>
"
how
shall
I
ever

she
reply
,

and
you
will
have
more

It
would
require

to

all

more

<EOS>
"
live

wistfully

I
hope
so

so

look
back
on
such
a
trifling
waste
youth

mine

<EOS>
I
humbly
hope
it

I
dare
not

there
be
a
sharp
misgiving

<EOS>
Her
cherubic
father
justly
remark
to
her
husband
that
the
baby
seem
to
make
her
young
than
before
,
remind
him
of
the
day
when
she
have
a
pet
doll
and
use
to
talk
to
it
as
she
carry
it
about
.
<EOS>
the
world
may
have
be
challenge
to
produce
another
baby
who
have
such
a
store
of
pleasant
nonsense
say
and
sing
to
it
,
as
Bella
say
and
sing
to
this
baby
;
or
who
be
dress
and
undress
as
in
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
as
Bella
dress
and
undress
this
baby
:
or
who
be
hold
behind
door
and
poke
out
to
stop
its
father
's
way
when
he
come
home
,
as
this
baby
be
;
or
,
in
a
word
,
who
do
half
the
number
of
baby
thing
,
through
the
lively
invention
of
a
gay
and
proud
young
mother
,
that
this
inexhaustible
baby
do

<EOS>
the
inexhaustible
baby
be
two
or
three
month
old
,
when
Bella
begin
to
notice
a
cloud
upon
her
husband

brow
.
<EOS>
watch
it
,
she
see
a
gathering

deepen
anxiety
there
,
which
cause
her
great
disquiet
.

more
than
once

she
awake
him
mutter
in
his
sleep
;
and
,
though
he
mutter
nothing
bad
than
her
own
name
,
it
be
plain
to
her
that
his
restlessness
originate
in
some
load
of
care
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
Bella
at
length
put
in
her
claim
to
divide
this
load
,
and
bear
her
half
of
it

very
considerate
of

it

His

l
to
destroy
such

out

not
even
he

for
such

only
be
feel

first

he
have
to
bear
the
combine
weight

what
he
have
do

of
that
haunting
reproach
that
he
may
have
do
it
so
much
well

of
the
dread
of

this
be
load
enough

and
find
some
slight
respite
even
in
enforce
additional
pain
upon
such
a
set

such

<EOS>
not

that
poor
mockery
of
relief
could
the

under

Time
go

time
go
by

in
such
public
account

he
begin
to
see
Mr.

who
act
as
lawyer
for

stray
further
from
the
fact

go
wide
of
the
issue

evidently
slacken
in
his
zeal
.
<EOS>
by
degree
,
a
glimmering
of
the
cause
of
this
begin
to
break
on
Bradley
's
sight

<EOS>
then
come
the
chance
encounter
with
Mr.
Milvey
at
the
railway
station
(
where
he
often
linger
in

would
be
circulate

then
he
see
in
the
light
what
he
have
bring
about

<EOS>
for
,
then
he
see
that
through
his
desperate
attempt
to
separate
those
two
for

he
have
be
make
the
mean
of
unite
them

<EOS>
that
he
have
dip
his
hand
in
blood

to
mark
himself

fool

tool

that
Eugene
Wrayburn

him
aside

the
direct
Power
what
it

in
his
impotent
mad
rage
bit
,

his
fit

<EOS>
new
assurance
of
the
truth
come
upon
him
in
the
next
few
follow
day
,
when
it
be
put
forth
how
the
wound
man
have
be
marry
on
his
bed

to
whom
,
and
how
,
though
always
in
a
dangerous
condition

he
be
a
shade
better

<EOS>
Bradley
would
far
rather
have
be

passage

know
himself

know
why

not

be
still
further

implicate
by
Riderhood

punish
by
the
law
for
his
abject
failure

as
though
it

be
a
success

he
keep
close
in
his
school
during
the
day

venture
out
warily
at
night

go
no

him
handsomely

him
to

the

us
a
visit
of
two

up

river
there

<EOS>
Lady
Tippins
next
canvass
the
Contractor
,
of
five
hundred
thousand
power
.
<EOS>
It
appear
to
this
potentate
,
that
what
the
man
in
question
should
have
do
,
would
have
be
,
to
buy
the
young
woman
a
boat
and
a
small
annuity
,
and
set
her
up
for
herself
.
<EOS>
these
thing
be
a
question
of
beefsteak
and
porter
.
<EOS>
You
buy
the
young
woman
a
boat
.
<EOS>
very
good
.
<EOS>
You
buy
her
,
at
the
same
time
,
a
small
annuity
.
<EOS>
You
speak
of
that
annuity
in
pound
sterling
,
but
it
be
in
reality
so
many
pound
of
beefsteak
and
so
many
pint
of
porter
.
<EOS>
on
the
one
hand
,
the
young
woman
have
the
boat
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
.
<EOS>
she
consume
so
many
pound
of
beefsteak
and
so
many
pint
of
porter
.
<EOS>
those
beefsteak
and
that
porter
be
the
fuel
to
that
young
woman
's
engine
.
<EOS>
She
derive
therefrom
a
certain
amount
of
power
to
row
the
boat
;
that
power
will
produce
so
much
money
;
you
add
that
to
the
small
annuity
;
and
thus
you
get
at
the
young
woman
's
income

<EOS>
that
(
it

look

POSTSCRIPT
,
in
LIEU
of
PREFACE
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
devise
this
story
,
I
foresaw
the
likelihood
that
a
class
of
reader
and
commentator
would
suppose
that
I
be
at
great
pain
to
conceal
exactly
what
I
be
at
great
pain
to
suggest
:
namely
,
that
Mr.
John
Harmon
be
not
slay
,
and
that
Mr.
John
Rokesmith
be
he
.
<EOS>
please
myself
with
the
idea
that
the
supposition
may
in
part
arise
out
of
some
ingenuity
in
the
story
,
and
think
it
worth
while
,
in
the
interest
of
art
,
to
hint
to
an
audience
that
an
artist
(
of
whatever
denomination
)
may
perhaps
be
trust
to
know
what
he
be
about
in
his
vocation
,
if
they
will
concede
him
a
little
patience
,
I
be
not
alarm
by
the
anticipation
.
  
<EOS>
to
keep
for
a
long
time
unsuspected
,
yet
always
work
itself
out
,
another
purpose
originate
in
that
lead
incident
,
and
turn
it
to
a
pleasant
and
useful
account
at
last
,
be
at
once
the
most
interesting
and
the
most
difficult
part
of
my
design
.
<EOS>
Its
difficulty
be
much
enhance
by
the
mode
of
publication
;
for
,
it
would
be
very
unreasonable
to
expect
that
many
reader
,
pursue
a
story
in
portion
from
month
to
month
through
nineteen
month
,
will
,
until
they
have
it
before
them
complete
,
perceive
the
relation
of
its
fine
thread
to
the
whole
pattern
which
be
always
before
the
eye
of
the
story
-
weaver
at
his
loom
.
<EOS>
yet
,
that
I
hold
the
advantage
of
the
mode
of
publication
to
outweigh
its
disadvantage
,
may
be
easily
believe
of
one
who
revive
it
in
the
Pickwick
Papers
after
long
disuse
,
and
have
pursue
it
ever
since
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
sometimes
an
odd
disposition
in
this
country
to
dispute
as
improbable
in
fiction
,
what
be
the
common
experience
in
fact
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
I
note
here
,
though
it
may
not
be
at
all
necessary
,
that
there
be
hundred
of
Will
Cases
(
as
they
be
call
)
,
far
more
remarkable
than
that
fancy
in
this
book

the

of
the
Prerogative
Office
teem

instance
of
testator
who
have
make
,
change
,
contradict
,
hide
,
forget
,
leave
cancel

and

uncancelled

each
many
more

than
be
ever
make
by
the
elder
Mr.
Harmon
of
Harmony
Jail

<EOS>
in
my
social
experience
since
Mrs.
Betty
Higden
come
upon
the
scene
and
leave
it
,
I
have
find
circumlocutional
champion
dispose
to
be
warm
with
me
on
the
subject
of
my
view
of
the
Poor
Law
.
<EOS>
My
friend
Mr.
Bounderby
could
never
see
any
difference
between
leave
the
Coketown
"
hand
"
exactly
as
they
be
,
and
require
them
to
be
feed
with
turtle
soup
and
venison
out
of
gold
spoon
.
<EOS>
idiotic
proposition
of
a
parallel
nature
have
be
freely
offer
for
my
acceptance
,
and
I
have
be
call
upon
to
admit
that
I
would
give
Poor
Law
relief
to
anybody
,
anywhere
,
anyhow
.
<EOS>
put
this
nonsense
aside
,
I
have
observe
a
suspicious
tendency
in
the
champion
to
divide
into
two
party
;
the
one
,
contend
that
there
be
no
deserve
Poor
who
prefer
death
by
slow
starvation
and
bitter
weather
,
to
the
mercy
of
some
Relieving
Officers
and
some
Union
Houses
;
the
other
,
admit
that
there
be
such
Poor
,
but
deny
that
they
have
any
cause
or
reason
for
what
they
do
.
<EOS>
the
record
in
our
newspaper
,
the
late
exposure
by
the
Lancet
,
and
the
common
sense
and
sense
of
common
people
,
furnish
too
abundant
evidence
against
both
defence
.
<EOS>
but
,
that
my
view
of
the
Poor
Law
may
not
be
mistake
or
misrepresent
,
I
will
state
it
.
<EOS>
I
believe
there
have
be
in
England
,
since
the
day
of
the
Stuarts
,
no
law
so
often
infamously
administer
,
no
law
so
often
openly
violate
,
no
law
habitually
<EOS>
so
ill
-
supervised
.
<EOS>
in
the
majority
of
the
shameful
case
of
disease
and
death
from
destitution
,
that
shock
the
public
and
disgrace
the
country
,
the
illegality
be
quite
equal
to
the
inhumanity
 
---
and
know
language
could
say
no
more
of
their
lawlessness
.
  
<EOS>
on
Friday
the
Ninth
of
June
in
the
present
year
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
(
in
their
manuscript
dress
of
receive
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Lammle
at
breakfast
)
be
on
the
South
Eastern
Railway
with
me
,
in
a
terribly
destructive
accident
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
do
what
I
could
to
help
other
,
I
climb
back
into
my
carriage
---
nearly
turn
over
a
viaduct
,
and
catch
aslant
upon
the
turn
---
to
extricate
the
worthy
couple
.
<EOS>
They
be
much
soil
,
but
otherwise
unhurt
.
<EOS>
the
same
happy
result
attend
Miss
Bella
Wilfer
on
her
wedding
day
,
and
Mr.
Riderhood
inspect
Bradley
Headstone
's
red
neckerchief
as
he
lie
asleep
.
<EOS>
I
remember
with
devout
thankfulness
that
I
can
never
be
much
near
part
company
with
my
reader
for
ever
,
than
I
be
then
,
until
there
shall
be
write
against
my
life
,
the
two
word
with
which
I
have
this
book
:
---
the
end
.
