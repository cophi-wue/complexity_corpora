two
of
the
myriad
of
London
's
nightworker
be
walk
down
Fleet
Street
together
soon
after
dawn
on
Sunday
morning
,
2nd
September
.
 
<EOS>
the
sun
have
not
yet
rise
.
<EOS>
that
main
artery
of
London
traffic
,
with
its
irregular
row
of
closed
shop
and
newspaper
office
,
be
quiet
and
pleasant
in
the
calm
,
mystic
light
before
the
falling
of
the
smoke
-
pall
.
 
<EOS>
only
at
early
morning
do
the
dear
old
City
look
its
good
;
in
that
one
quiet
,
sweet
hour
when
the
night
's
toil
have
end
and
the
day
's
have
not
yet
begin
.
<EOS>
only
in
that
brief
interval
at
the
birth
of
day
,
when
the
rise
tint
of
the
sky
glow
slowly
into
gold
,
do
the
giant
metropolis
repose
--
at
least
,
as
far
as
its
business
street
be
concern
--
for
at
five
o'clock
the
toil
million
begin
to
again
pour
in
from
all
point
of
the
compass
,
and
the
stress
and
storm
of
London
at
once
recommence
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
that
hour
of
silent
charm
the
two
grey
-
beard
sub
-
editor
,
though
engage
in
office
of
rival
newspaper
be
make
their
way
homeward
to
Dulwich
to
spend
Sunday
in
a
well
-
earn
rest
,
and
be
chat
"
shop
,
"
as
Press
man
do
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
have
the
same
trouble
to
get
that
Yarmouth
story
through
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Fergusson
,
the
news
-
editor
of
the
"
Dispatch
,
"
as
they
cross
Whitefriars
Street
.
<EOS>
"
We
get
about
half
a
column
,
and
then
the
wire
shut
down
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
telegraph
or
telephone
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
Baines
,
who
be
four
or
five
year
young
than
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
be
use
both
--
to
make
sure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
be
we
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
rattle
good
story
--
the
robbery
be
mysterious
,
to
say
the
least
--
but
we
do
not
get
more
than
half
of
it
.
<EOS>
something
be
wrong
with
the
line
,
evidently
,
"
baine
say
.
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
not
such
a
perfect
autumn
morning
,
I
should
be
incline
to
think
there
have
be
a
storm
somewhere
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
--
funny
,
be
not
it
?
"
remark
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
a
shame
we
have
not
the
whole
story
,
for
it
be
a
first
-
class
one
,
and
we
want
something
.
<EOS>
do
you
put
it
on
the
content
-
bill
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
because
we
could
not
get
the
finish
.
<EOS>
I
try
in
every
way
--
ring
up
the
Central
News
,
P.A.
,
Exchange
Telegraph
Company
,
try
to
get
through
to
Yarmouth
on
the
trunk
,
and
spend
half
an
hour
or
so
potter
about
,
but
the
reply
from
all
the
agency
,
from
everywhere
,
in
fact
,
be
the
same
--
the
line
be
interrupt
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
just
our
case
.
<EOS>
I
telephone
to
the
Post
Office
,
but
the
reply
come
back
that
the
line
be
evidently
down
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
it
certainly
look
as
though
there
have
be
a
storm
,
but----
"
and
Baines
glance
at
the
bright
,
clear
sky
overhead
,
just
flush
by
<EOS>
the
burst
sun--"there
be
certainly
no
trace
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
often
a
storm
on
the
coast
when
it
be
quite
still
in
London
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
remark
his
friend
wisely
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
very
well
.
<EOS>
but
when
all
communication
with
a
big
place
like
Yarmouth
be
suddenly
cut
off
,
as
it
have
be
,
I
can
not
help
suspect
that
something
have
happen
which
we
ought
to
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
perhaps
right
,
after
all
,
"
Fergusson
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
if
anything
have
happen
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
want
to
be
call
back
to
the
office
,
either
of
us
.
<EOS>
My
assistant
,
Henderson
,
whom
I
have
leave
in
charge
,
ring
me
up
over
any
mare
's
nest
.
<EOS>
the
trunk
telephone
all
come
into
the
Post
Office
Exchange
up
in
Carter
Lane
.
<EOS>
why
not
look
in
there
before
we
go
home
?
<EOS>
It
will
not
take
us
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
we
have
several
train
home
from
Ludgate
Hill
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Baines
look
at
his
watch
.
<EOS>
like
his
companion
,
he
have
no
desire
to
be
call
back
to
his
office
after
get
out
to
Dulwich
,
and
yet
he
be
in
no
mood
to
go
make
reporter
's
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
I
will
go
.
<EOS>
It
be
sure
to
be
nothing
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
besides
,
I
have
a
beastly
headache
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
heavy
night
's
work
.
<EOS>
one
of
my
man
be
away
ill
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
at
any
rate
,
I
think
I
will
go
,
"
Fergusson
say
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
blame
me
if
you
get
call
back
for
a
special
edition
with
a
terrible
storm
,
great
loss
of
life
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
so
long
.
"
<EOS>
and
,
smile
,
he
wave
his
hand
and
part
from
his
friend
in
the
booking
office
of
Ludgate
Hill
Station
.
 
<EOS>
quicken
his
pace
,
he
hurry
through
the
office
,
and
,
pass
out
by
the
back
,
ascend
the
steep
,
narrow
street
until
he
reach
the
Post
Office
Telephone
Exchange
in
Carter
Lane
,
where
,
present
his
card
,
he
ask
to
see
the
superintendent
-
in

charge
.
 
<EOS>
without
much
delay
he
be
show
upstairs
into
a
small
private
office
,
into
which
come
a
short
,
dapper
,
fair
-
moustached
man
with
the
bustle
of
a
man
in
a
great
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
call
,
"
the
sub
-
editor
explain
,
"
to
know
whether
you
can
tell
me
anything
regard
the
cause
of
the
interruption
of
the
line
to
Yarmouth
a
short
time
ago
.
<EOS>
We
have
some
important
news
come
through
,
but
be
cut
off
just
in
the
midst
of
it
,
and
then
we
receive
information
that
all
the
telephone
and
telegraph
line
to
Yarmouth
be
interrupt

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
that
be
just
the
very
point
which
be
puzzle
us
at
this
moment
,
"
be
the
night
-
superintendent
's
reply
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
quite
unaccountable
.
<EOS>
Our
trunk
go
to
Yarmouth
seem
to
be
down
,
as
well
as
the
telegraph
.
<EOS>
Yarmouth
,
Lowestoft
,
and
beyond
beccle
seem
all
to
have
be
suddenly
cut
off
.
<EOS>
about
eighteen
minute
to
four
the
operator
notice
something
wrong
,
switch
the
trunk
through
to
the
tester
,
and
the
latter
report
to
me
in
due
course
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
strange
!
<EOS>
do
they
all
break
down
together
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
the
first
that
fail
be
the
one
that
run
through
Chelmsford
,
Colchester
,
and
Ipswich
up
to
Lowestoft
and
Yarmouth
.
<EOS>
the
operator
find
that
he
could
get
through
to
Ipswich
and
Beccles
.
<EOS>
Ipswich
know
nothing
,
except
that
something
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
They
could
still
ring
up
beccle
,
but
not
beyond
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
they
be
speak
,
there
be
a
tap
at
the
door
,
and
the
assistant
night
-
superintendent
enter
,
say
:
 
"
the
Norwich
line

Scole

Long
Stratton

<EOS>
about
half
-
past
four
Norwich
report
a
fault
somewhere
north
,
between
there
and
Cromer

<EOS>
but
the
operator
now
say
that
the
line
be
apparently
break

and
so
be
all
the
telegraph
from
there
to
Cromer

Sheringham

Holt

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
another
line
have
go

then
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
the
superintendent
-
in

charge
,
utterly
astounded
.
"
<EOS>
have
you
try
to
get
on
to
Cromer
by
the
other
route

through
Nottingham
and
King

or
through
Cambridge
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
tester
have
try
every
route
,
but
there
be
no
response
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
could
get
through
to
some
of
the
place
--
Yarmouth

for
instance
--
by
telegraph
to
the
Continent

I
suppose
?
"
ask
Fergusson
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
be
already
try

respond
the
assistant
superintendent
.
 
<EOS>
"

run
out
from
the
east
coast
in

neighbourhood

inquire
the
sub
-
editor
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
five

Southwold
and
Cromer
--
three
run
to
Germany
,
and
two
to
Holland
,
"
reply
the
assistant
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
the
cable

in
the
Frisian
Islands

<EOS>

"
ask
his

an
hour

route
to
Yarmouth

be
the

<EOS>
"
I
also
ask
Liverpool
Street
Station
and
King
's
Cross
to
wire
down
to
some
of
their
station
on
the
coast
,
but
the
reply
be
that
they
be
in
the
same
predicament
as
ourselves
--
their
line
be
down
north
of
Beccles
,
Wymondham
,
East
Dereham
,
and
also
south
of
Lynn
.
<EOS>
I
will
just
run
along
and
see
if
there
be
any
reply
from
Paris
.
<EOS>
They
ought
to
be
through
by
this
time
,
as
it
be
Sunday
morning
,
and
no
traffic
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
go
out
hurriedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
certainly
something
very
peculiar
,
"
remark
the
superintendent
-
in
-
charge
to
the
sub
-
editor
.
<EOS>
"
if
there
be
be
an
earthquake

an
electrical
disturbance

extraordinary
one

single
line

to
the
coast
seem
interrupted

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
It
be
uncommonly
funny

Fergusson
remark
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
could
have
happen
.
<EOS>
You
have
never
have
a
complete
breakdown
like
this
before

"
 
<EOS>
"
never

<EOS>
but
I
think----
"
 
<EOS>
the
sentence
remain
unfinished
,
for
his
assistant
return
with
a
slip
of
paper
in
his
hand
,
say
:

<EOS>
"
It
be
mysterious
--
most
mysterious
!
"
<EOS>
and
,
take
up
the
instrument
upon
his
table
,
he
place
a
plug
in
one
of
the
hole
down
the
front
of
the
table
itself
,
and
a
moment
later
be
in
conversation
with
the
official
in
charge
of
the
traffic
at
Liverpool
Street
,
repeat
the
report
from
Paris
,
and
urge
him
to
send
light
engine
north
from
Wymondham
or
Beccles
into
the
zone
of
the
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
the
reply
come
back
that
he
have
already
do
so
,
but
a
telegram
have
reach
him
from
Wymondham
to
the
effect
that
the
road
-
bridge
between
Kimberley
and
Hardingham
have
apparently
fall
in
,
and
the
line
be
block
by
debris
.
<EOS>
interruption
be
also
report
beyond
Swaffham

at
a
place
call
Little

<EOS>
"
then
even
the
railway
themselves
be
break
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Fergusson
.
<EOS>
"
be
it
possible
that
there
have
be
a
great
earthquake
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
an
earthquake
could
not
very
well
destroy
all
five
cable
from
the
Continent
,
"
remark
the
superintendent
gravely
.
 
<EOS>
the
latter
have
scarcely
place
the
receiver
upon
the
hook
when
a
third
man
enter
--
an
operator
who
,
address
him
,
say
:
 
"
Will
you
please
come
to
the
switchboard
,
sir
?
<EOS>
there
be
a
man
in
the
Ipswich
call
office
who
have
just
tell
me
a
most
extraordinary
story
.
<EOS>
He
say
that
he
start
in
his
motor
-
car
alone
from
Lowestoft
to
London
at
half
-
past
three
this
morning
,
and
just
as
it
be
get
light
he
be
pass
along
the
edge
of
Henham
Park
,
between
Wangford
village
and
Blythburgh
,
when
he
see
three
man
apparently
repair
the
telegraph
wire
.
<EOS>
one
be
up
the
pole
,
and
the
other
two
be
stand
below
.
<EOS>
as
he
pass
he
see
a
flash
,
for
,
to
his
surprise
,
one
of
the
man
fire
point
-
blank
at
him
with
a
revolver
.
<EOS>
fortunately
,
the
shot
go
wide
,
and
he
at
once
put
on
a
move
and
get
down
into
Blythburgh
village
,
even
though
one
of
his
tyre
go
down
.
<EOS>
It
have
probably
be
pierce
by
the
bullet
fire
at
him
,
as
the
puncture
be
unlike
any
he
have
ever
have
before
.
<EOS>
at
Blythburgh
he
inform
the
police
of
the
outrage
,
and
the
constable
,
in
turn
,
wake
up
the
postmaster
,
who
try
to
telegraph
back
to
the
police
at
Wrentham
,
but
find
that
the
line
be
interrupt
.
<EOS>
be
it
possible
that
the
man
be
cut
the
wire
,
instead
of
repair
them
?
<EOS>
He
say
that
after
repair
the
puncture
he
take
the
village
constable
and
three
other
man
on
his
car
and
go
back
to
the
spot
,
where
,
although
the
trio
have
escape
,
they
see
that
wholesale
havoc
have
be
work
with
the
telegraph
.
<EOS>
the
line
have
be
sever
in
four
or
five
place

the

then

<EOS>
then

just
as

<EOS>
various

<EOS>
certain

<EOS>
such
be
the
amazing
news

high

up
room
in
Carter

,
City
,
on
that
sweet
,
sunny
morning
when
all
the
great
world
of
London
be
at
peace
,
either
still
slumber
or
week

ending

<EOS>
Fergusson
remain
for
a
full
hour
and
a
half
at
the
Telephone
Exchange
,
anxiously
await

come
over

how
panic

stricken
people
be
flee
inland
away
from

<EOS>
then

hansom
to
the
"
Dispatch
"
office
,
and
proceed
to
prepare
a
special
edition
of
his
paper
--
an
edition

surely
the
most
amazing
news
that
have
ever
startle
London

<EOS>
fear
to
create
undue
panic
,
he
decide
not
to

<EOS>
He
want
the
story
of
the
man
who
have

<EOS>
He
pace
his
room
excitedly
,
wonder
what
effect
the

would
have
upon
the
world
.
<EOS>
in
the
rival
newspaper
office
the
report
be
,
as

,
unknown

<EOS>
with
journalistic
forethought
he
have
arrange

the
bewilder
truth
should
not
leak
out
to
his
rival
,
either
from
the
railway
termini
or
from
the
telephone

<EOS>
His
only
fear
be
that
some

may
telegraph
from
some
village

town
near

the
metropolis
which
be
still

he
look
up
and
down
the

for
the

<EOS>
but
all
be
quiet

<EOS>
eight
o'clock
have
just
boom

,
and
London

<EOS>
the

,
be
quite
empty

save
for
a

of
motor

omnibus
and
a
sprinkling

<EOS>
in
that
centre
of

Sir

like

they
at
first
believe
the
pale

bearded

but
a

when

whatever

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
Germans
evidently
lay
their
plan
with
great
cleverness

both

the

<EOS>
It
seem
incredible

<EOS>
and
yet
the
enemy
have
,
by
his
sudden
and
stealthy
blow
,
secure
command
of
the
sea
and
actually
land
.
 
<EOS>
the
public
wonder
why
a
formal
declaration
of
war
have
not
previously
be
make
,
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
the
declaration
precede
the
Franco
-
German
War
be
the
first
make
by
any
civilised
nation
prior
to
the
commencement
of
hostility
for
one
hundred
and
seventy
year
.
<EOS>
the
peril
of
the
nation
be
now
recognise
on
every
hand
.
 
<EOS>
eager
million
pour
into
the
City
by
every
train
from
the
suburb
and
town
in
the
vicinity
of
the
Metropolis
,
anxious
to
ascertain
the
truth
for
themselves
,
pale
with
terror
,
wild
with
excitement
,
<EOS>
indignant
that
our
land
force
be
not
already
mobilise
and
ready
to
move
eastward
to
meet
the
invader
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
bank
be
open
there
be
a
run
on
them
,
but
by
noon
the
Bank
of
England
have
suspend
all
specie
payment
.
<EOS>
the
other
bank
,
be
thus
unable
to
meet
their
engagement
,
simply
close
the
door
,
bring
business
to
an
abrupt
standstill
.
<EOS>
consol
stand
at
90
on
Saturday
,
but
by
noon
on
Monday
be
down
to
42
-
-lower
even
than
they
be
in
1798
,
when
they
stand
at
47
-
1/4
.
<EOS>
number
of
foreigner
try
to
speculate
heavily
,
but
be
unable
to
do
so
,
for
banking
be
suspend
they
could
not
obtain
transfer
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
Stock
Exchange
the
panic
in
the
afternoon
be
indescribable
.
<EOS>
security
of
every
sort
go
entirely
to
piece
,
and
there
be
no
buyer
.
<EOS>
financier
be
surprised
that
no
warning
in
London
have
betray
the
position
of
affair
,
London
be
the
money
centre
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
prior
to
1870
Paris
share
with
London
the
honour
of
be
the
pivot
of
the
money
market
,
but
on
the
suspension
of
cash
payment
by
the
Bank
of
France
during
the
Franco
-
German
War
,
Paris
lose
that
position
.
<EOS>
have
it
not
be
that
the
milliard
comprise
the
French
War
indemnity
be
intact
in
golden
louis
in
the
fortress
of
Spandau
,
Germany
could
never
have
hope
to
wage
sudden
war
with
Great
Britain
before
she
have
make
Berlin
independent
of
London
in
a
money
sense
,
or
,
at
any
rate
,
to
accumulate
sufficient
gold
to
carry
on
the
war
for
at
least
twelve
month
.
<EOS>
the
only
way
in
which
she
could
have
do
this
be
to
raise
her
rate
so
as
to
offer
well
term
than
London
.
<EOS>
yet
directly
the
Bank
of
England
discover
the
rate
of
exchange
go
against
her
,
and
her
stock
of
gold
diminishing
,
she
would
have
respond
by
raise
the
english
bank
-
rate
in
order
to
check
the
flow
.
<EOS>
thus
competition
would
have
go
on
until
the
rate
become
so
high
that
all
business
would
be
check
,
and
people
would
have
realise
their
security
to
obtain
the
necessary
money
to
carry
on
their
affair
.
<EOS>
thus
,
no
doubt
,
the
coming
war
would
have
be
forecast
have
it
not
be
for
Germany
's
already
prepare
war
-
chest
,
which
the
majority
of
person
have
nowadays
overlook
.
<EOS>
Its
possession
have
enable
Germany
to
strike
her
sudden
blow
,
and
now
the
Bank
of
England
,
which
be
the
final
reserve
of
gold
in
the
United
Kingdom
,
find
that
as
note
be
cash
so
the
stock
of
gold
diminish
until
it
be
in
a
few
hour
compel
to
obtain
from
the
Government
suspension
of
the
Bank
charter
.
<EOS>
this
enable
the
Bank
to
suspend
cash
payment
,
and
issue
note
without
a
corresponding
deposit
of
the
equivalent
in
gold
.
 
<EOS>
the
suspension
,
contrary
to
increase
the
panic
,
have
,
curiously
enough
the
immediate
effect
of
somewhat
allay
it
.
<EOS>
plenty
of
people
in
the
City
be
confident
that
the
blow
aim
could
not
prove
an
effective
one
,
and
that
the
Germans
,
however
many
may
have
land
,
would
quickly
be
send
back
again
.
<EOS>
thus
many
level
-
head
business
man
regard
the
position
calmly
,
believe
that
when
our
command
of
the
sea
be
again
re

establish
,
as
it
must
be
in
a
day
or
two
,
the
enemy
would
soon
be
non

existent
.
 
<EOS>
business
outside
the
money
market
be
,
of
course
,
utterly
demoralise
.
<EOS>
the
buying
of
necessity
be
now
uppermost
in
everyone
's
mind
.
<EOS>
excited
crowd
in
the
street
cause
most
of
the

in
the

and
West

while

various

whichever

responsible
for
the
bad
steering
or
neglect
of
the

it
be
certain
that
the

be
cut
into
by
the
stem

<EOS>
in

such

last
night

which
render
it
impossible
to
draw
any
other
conclusion
than
that
the
affair
be
anything
but
an
accident
.
<EOS>
everything
now
go
to
prove
that
the
whole
business
be
premeditate

be
the
result
of
an
organised

the
object

up

to
the
quarter

engineer

It
be
nothing
less
than
an
outrage
to
perpetrate
what
be
in
reality
an
overt
act
of
hostility

time
of
profound
peace
,
however
much
the
political
horizon
may
be
darken

We
be
live
under
a
Government
whose
leader
lose
no

in
announce
that
no
fear
of
be
sneer
at
as
a
'
Little
Englander
'
would
deter
him
from
seek
peace
and
ensure
it
by
a
reduction
of
our
naval

military
armament

even
at

know
to

inadequate

the

likely

We

that
even

the

the
report

attract
the
attention

two
picket

boat

<EOS>
as
she
turn
a
bend
in
the
stream
they
both
shoot
up
alongside
out
of
the
darkness
,
and
order
her
peremptorily
to
stop
.
<EOS>
but
the
only
answer
they
receive
be
the
sudden
extinction
of
all
light
in
the
steamer
.
<EOS>
They
keep
alongside
,
or
rather
one
of
them
do
,
but
they
be
quite
helpless
to
stay
the
progress
of
the
big
wall

sided
steamer

the
fast
of
the
picket

boat
shoot
ahead

the
object
of
warn
those

busy

close

hardly

the
officer
in

picket

boat
deliver
his
warning
before
she

close
at

within

slow
down

for
fear
of
run
right
over
them

<EOS>
on
she
come
,
inevitable
as
Fate

<EOS>
there
be
a
crash
as
she
come
into
collision
with
the
central
deckhouse
of
the
'

as
her
bow
scrape
past

Her

down

two
simultaneous
shout
of
'
Man

come
from

and
boat
at
opposite
side
of

river

<EOS>
when
a
certain
amount

order

restore
it
be
discover
that
a
big
dockyard
tug
be
settle
down
by
the
head

<EOS>
It
seem
she
have
be
graze
by
the
'
Van

'
as
she
come
over
the
obstruction
,
and
force
against
some
portion
of
one
of
the
founder
vessel
,
which
have
pierce
a
hole
in
her
below
the
water

line

<EOS>

in
the
general
excitement
the
damage
have
not
be
discover

now
she
be
sink
fast

<EOS>
hawser
be
make
fast
to
her
with
the
utmost
expedition
possible
in
order
to
tow
her
clear
of
the
pile

up
wreckage
,
but
it
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
there
be
only
just
time
to
rescue
her
crew
before
she
too
add
herself
to
the
underwater
barricade
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
crew
of
the
'
Van
Gysen
,
'
it
be
think
that
all
must
have
go
down
in
her
,
as
no
trace
of
them
have
as
yet
be
discover
,
despite
a
most
diligent
search
,
for
it
be
consider
that
,
in
an
affair
which
have
be
so
carefully
plan
as
this
certainly
must
have
be
,
some
provision
must
surely
have
be
make
for
the
escape
of
the
crew
.
<EOS>
those
who
have
be
down
at
the
scene
of
the
disaster
report
that
it
will
be
impossible
to
clear
the
channel
in
less
than
a
week
or
ten
day
,
use
every
resource
of
the
dockyard
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
little
later
I
think
I
would
go
down
to
the
dockyard
on
the
off
-
chance
of
pick
up
any
further
information
.
<EOS>
the
Metropolitan
policeman
at
the
gate
would
on
no
account
allow
me
to
pass
at
that
hour
,
and
I
be
just
turn
away
when
,
by
a
great
piece
of
good
fortune
,
I
run
up
against
Commander
Shelley

manoeuvre
of
the
year
before
last
.
'
<EOS>
and
what
be
you
do
down
here
?
'
<EOS>
be
his
very
natural
inquiry
after
we
have
shake
hand
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
that
I
have
be
down
in
Chatham
for
a
week
past
as
special
correspondent
,
report
on
the
half
-
hearted
preparation
be
make
for
the
possible
mobilisation
,
and
take
the
opportunity
of
ask
him
if
he
could
give
me
any
further
information
about
the
collision
between
the
three
steamer
in
the
Medway
.
'
<EOS>
well
,
'
say
he
,
'
the
good
thing
you
can
do
be
to
come
right
along
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
be
hawk
out
of
bed
to
superintend
the
diving
operation
,
which
will
begin
the
moment
there
be
a
gleam
of
daylight
.
'
<EOS>
needless
to
say
,
this
just
suit
me
,
and
I
hasten
to
thank
him
and
to
accept
his
kind
offer
.
'
<EOS>
all
right
,
'
he
say
,
'
but
I
shall
have
to
make
one
small
condition
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
'
and
that
be
?
'
<EOS>
I
query
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
merely
to
let
me
"
censor
"
your
telegram
before
you
send
them
,
'
he
return
.
'
<EOS>
You
see
,
the
Admiralty
may
not
like
to
have
too
much
say
about
this
business
,
and
I
do
not
want
to
find
myself
in
the
dirt
-
tub
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
the
stipulation
be
a
most
reasonable
one
,
and
however
I
dislike
the
notion
of
have
probably
my
good
paragraph
eliminate
,
I
could
not
but
assent
to
my
friend
's
proposition
.
<EOS>
so
away
we
march
down
the
echo
space
of
the
almost
deserted
dockyard
till
we
arrive
at
the
'
Thunderbolt
'
pontoon
.
<EOS>
here
lay
a
pinnace
with
steam
up
,
and
light
down
the
sloping
side
of
the
old
ironclad
by
the
lantern
of
the
policeman
on
duty
,
we
step
on
board
and
shoot
out
into
the
centre
of
the
stream
.
<EOS>
We
blow
our
whistle
and
the
coxswain
wave
a
lantern
,
whereupon
a
small
tug
that
have
a
couple
of
dockyard
lighter
attach
give
a
hoarse
'
toot
'
in
response
,
and
follow
us
down
the
river
.
<EOS>
We
speed
along
in
the
darkness
against
a
strong
tide
that
be
make
upstream
,
past
Upnor
Castle
,
that
quaint
old
Tudor
fortress
with
its
long
line
of
modern
powder
magazine
,
and
along
under
the
deep
shadow
beneath
Hoo
Woods
till
we
come
abreast
of
the
medley
of
mud
flat
and
grass
-
grow
islet
just
beyond
them
.
<EOS>
here
above
the
thud
of
the
engine
and
the
plash
of
the
water
,
a
thin
,
long
-
draw
-
out
cry
waver
through
the
night
.
'
<EOS>
some
one
hail
the
boat
,
sir
,
'
report
the
lookout
forward
.
<EOS>
We
have
all
hear
it
.
'
<EOS>
ease
down
,
'
order
Shelley
,
and
hardly
move
against
the
rushing
tideway
we
listen
for
its
repetition
.
<EOS>
again
the
voice
be
raise
in
quaver
supplication
.
'
<EOS>
what
the
dickens
do
he
say
?
'
<EOS>
query
the
commander
.
'
<EOS>
It
be
german
,
'
I
answer
.
'
<EOS>
I
know
that
language
well
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
be
ask
for
help
.
<EOS>
May
I
answer
him
?
'
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
'
by
all
mean
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
belong
to
one
of
those
steamer
.
'
<EOS>
the
same
thought
be
in
my
own
mind
.
<EOS>
I
hail
in
return
,
ask
where
he
be
and
what
he
want
.
<EOS>
the
answer
come
back
that
he
be
a
shipwreck
seaman
,
who
be
cold
,
wet
,
and
miserable
,
and
implore
to
be
take
off
from
the
islet
where
he
find
himself
,
cut
off
from
everywhere
by
water
and
darkness
.
<EOS>
We
run
the
boat
's
nose
into
the
bank
,
and
presently
succeed
in
haul
aboard
a
miserable
object
,
wet
through
,
and
plaster
from
head
to
foot
with
black
Medway
mud
.
<EOS>
the
broken
remain
of
a
cork
life
-
belt
hang
from
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
a
dram
of
whisky
somewhat
revive
him
.
'
<EOS>
and
now
,
'
say
Shelley
,
'
you
would
better
cross
-
examine
him
.
<EOS>
We
may
get
something
out
of
the
fellow
.
'
<EOS>
the
foreigner
,
crouch
down
shiver
in
the
stern
-
sheet
half
cover
with
a
yellow
oilskin
that
some
charitable
bluejacket
have
throw
over
him
,
appear
to
me
in
the
light
of
the
lantern
that
stand
on
the
deck
before
him
to
be
not
only
suffer
from
cold
,
but
from
terror
.
<EOS>
a
few
moment
'
conversation
with
him
confirm
my
suspicion
.
<EOS>
I
turn
to
Shelley
and
exclaim
,
'
He
say
he
will
tell
us
everything
if
we
spare
his
life
,
'
I
explain
.
'
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
do
not
want
to
shoot
the
chap
,
'
reply
the
commander
.
'
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
be
implicate
in
this
"
bottle
up
"
affair
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
,
he
jolly
well
deserve
it
,
but
I
do
not
suppose
anything
will
be
do
to
him
.
<EOS>
anyway
,
his
information
may
be
valuable
,
and
so
you
may
tell
him
that
he
be
all
right
as
far
as
I
be
concerned
,
and
I
will
do
my
good
for
him
with
the
Admiral
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
that
will
satisfy
him
.
<EOS>
if
not
,
you
may
threaten
him
a
bit
.
<EOS>
tell
him
anything
you
like
if
you
think
it
will
make
him
speak
.
'
<EOS>
to
cut
a
long
story
short
,
I
find
the
damp
Dutchman
amenable
to
reason
,
and
the
following
be
the
substance
of
what
I
elicit
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
have
be
a
deck
hand
on
board
the
'
Van
Gysen
.
'
<EOS>
when
she
leave
Rotterdam
he
do
not
know
that
the
trip
be
anything
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
new
skipper
whom
he
have
not
see
before
,
and
there
be
also
two
new
mate
with
a
new
chief
engineer
.
<EOS>
another
steamer
follow
them
all
the
way
till
they
arrive
at
the
Nore
.
<EOS>
on
the
way
over
he
and
several
other
seaman
be
send
for
by
the
captain
,
and
ask
if
they
would
volunteer
for
a
dangerous
job
,
promise
them
L50
a
-
piece
if
it
come
off
all
right
.
<EOS>
He
and
five
other
agree
,
as
do
two
or
three
stoker
,
and
be
then
order
to
remain
aft
and
not
communicate
with
any
other
of
the
crew
.
<EOS>
off
the
Nore
all
the
remainder
be
transfer
to
the
follow
steamer
,
which
steam
off
to
the
eastward
.
<EOS>
after
they
be
go
the
select
man
be
tell
that
the
officer
all
belong
to
the
imperial
german
Navy
,
and
by
order
of
the
Kaiser
be
about
to
attempt
to
block
up
the
Medway
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
collision
between
two
other

have
be
arrange
for
,
one
of
which
be
load
with
a
mass
of
old
steel
rail
into

liquid
cement

so
that

impenetrable
block

<EOS>
the

a
similar
cargo
,

be
provide
with
an
arrangement
for
blow
hole
in

bottom

<EOS>
the
crew
be
provide
with
life

belt
,
and
the
half
of
the
money
promise
,
and
all
except
the
captain
,
the
engineer
,
and
the
two
mate
drop
overboard
just
before
arrive
at
the
sink
vessel

<EOS>
They
be
advise
to
make
their
way
to
Gravesend
,
and
then
to
shift
for
themselves
as
best
they
could
.
<EOS>
He
have
find
himself
on
a
small
island

could
not
muster
up
courage
to
plunge
into
the
cold

"
'
by
Jove
!
<EOS>
this
mean

Shelley

comment

<EOS>
at
two
o'clock
this
afternoon
we
know
that
it
do
,
for
the
news
of
the
enemy
's
landing
in
Norfolk
be
signal
down
from
the
dockyard
.
<EOS>
We
also
know
from
the
diver
that
the
cargo
of
the
sink
steamer
be
what
the
rescue
seaman
have
state
it
to
be
.
<EOS>
Our
bottle
have
be
fairly
well
cork
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
amazing
revelation
show
how
cleverly
contrive
be
the
german
plan
of
hostility
.
<EOS>
all
our
splendid
ship
at
Chatham
have
,
in
that
brief
half
-
hour
,
be
bottle
up
and
render
utterly
useless
.
<EOS>
yet
the
authority
be
not
blameless
in
the
matter
,
for
in
November
,
1905
,
a
foreign
warship
actually
come
up
the
Medway
in
broad
daylight
,
and
be
not
notice
until
she
begin
to
bang
away
her
salute
,
much
to
the
utter
consternation
of
every
one
.
 
<EOS>
this
incident
,
however
,
be
but
one
of
the
many
illustration
of
German
's
craft
and
cunning
.
<EOS>
the
whole
scheme
have
be
year
in
careful
preparation
.
 
<EOS>
She
intend
to
invade
us
,
and
regard
every
stratagem
as
allowable
in
her
sudden
dash
upon
England
,
an
expedition
which
promise
to
result
in
the
most
desperate
war
of
modern
time
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
moment
the
"
Globe
,
"
at
last
arouse
from
its
long
and
peaceful
sleep
,
reproduce
those
plain
,
prophetic
word
of
Lord
Overstone
,
write
some
year
before
to
the
Royal
Defence
Commission
:
"
<EOS>
negligence
alone
can
bring
about
the
calamity
under
discussion
.
<EOS>
unless
we
suffer
ourselves
to
be
surprised
we
can
not
be
invade
with
success
.
<EOS>
It
be
useless
to
discuss
what
will
occur
or
what
can
be
do
after
London
have
fall
into
the
hand
of
an
invade
foe
.
<EOS>
the
apathy
which
may
render
the
occurrence
of
such
a
catastrophe
possible
will
not
afterwards
enable
the
country
,
enfeeble
,
dispirit
,
and
disorganise
by
the
loss
of
its
capital
,
to
redeem
the
fatal
error
.

"
 
<EOS>

that
prophecy
to
be
fulfil

<EOS>
some
highly
interesting
information
be
give
by

briefly

shortly

about
six
o'clock
on
Tuesday
evening
,
contain
another
remarkable
story
which
throw
some
further
light
upon
the
german
movement
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
of
course
,
know
that
practically
the
whole
of
the
Norfolk
and
Suffolk
coast
be
already
hold
by
the
enemy
,
but
with
the
exception
of
the
fact
that
the
enemy
's
cavalry
vedette
and
reconnoitre
patrol
be
out
everywhere
at
a
distance
about
twenty
mile
from
the
shore
,
England
be
entirely
in
the
dark
as
to
what
have
occur
anywhere
else
but
at
Lowestoft
.
<EOS>
attempt
have
be
make
to
penetrate
the
cavalry
screen
at
various
point
,
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
what
be
in
progress
be
carefully
keep
a
secret
by
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
the
veil
be
,
however
,
now
lift
.
<EOS>
the
story
which
the
"
Evening
Star
"
have
obtain
exclusively
,
and
which
be
eagerly
read
everywhere
,
have
be
relate
by
a
man
name
Scotney
,
a
lobster
-
fisherman
,
of
Sheringham
,
in
Norfolk
,
who
have
make
the
follow
statement
to
the
chief
officer
of
coastguard
at
Wainfleet
,
in
Lincolnshire
:
 
<EOS>
"
just
before
dawn
on
Sunday
morning
I
be
in
the
boat
with
my
son
Ted
off
the
Robin
Friend
,
take
up
the
lobster
pot
,
when
we
suddenly
see
about
three
mile
off
shore
<EOS>
a
mixed
lot
of
curious
-
look
craft
string
out
right
across
the
horizon
,
and
head
apparently
for
Cromer
.
<EOS>
there
be
steamer
big
and
little
,
many
of
them
tow
queer
flat
-
bottom
kind
of
boat
,
lighter
,
and
barge
,
which
,
on
approach
nearer
,
we
could
distinctly
see
be
fill
to
their
utmost
capacity
with
man
and
horse
.
 
<EOS>
"
both
Ted
and
I
stand
stare
at
the
unusual
sight
,
wonder
whatever
it
mean
.
<EOS>
They
come
on
very
quickly
,
however
--
so
quickly
,
indeed
,
that
we
think
it
best
to
move
on
.
<EOS>
the
big
ship
go
along
to
Weybourne
Gap
,
where
they
moor
in
the
twenty
-
five
foot
of
water
that
run
in
close
to
the
shore
,
while
some
small
steamer
and
the
flat
be
run
high
and
dry
on
the
hard
shingle
.
<EOS>
before
this
I
notice
that
there
be
quite
a
number
of
foreign
warship
in
the
offing
,
with
several
destroyer
far
away
in
the
distance
both
to
east
and
west
.
 
<EOS>
"
from
the
large
steamship
all
sort
of
boat
be
lower
,
include
apparently
many
collapsible
whaleboat
,
and
into
these
,
in
a
most
orderly
manner
,
from
every
gangway
and
accommodation
-
ladder
,
troop
--
Germans
we
afterwards
discover
them
to
be
,
to
our
utter
astonishment
--
begin
to
descend
.
 
<EOS>
"
these
boat
be
at
once
take
charge
of
by
steam
pinnace
and
cutter
and
tow
to
the
beach
.
<EOS>
when
we
see
this
we
be
utterly
dumbfound
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
at
first
I
believe
it
to
be
a
dream
,
for
ever
since
I
be
a
lad
<EOS>
I
have
hear
the
ancient
rhyme
my
old
father
be
so
fond
of
repeat
:
     
"
'
He
who
would
Old
England
win
,
    
Must
at
Weybourne
Hoop
begin
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
as
everybody
know
,
nature
have
provide
at
that
lonely
spot
every
advantage
for
the
landing
of
hostile
force
,
and
when
the
Spanish
Armada
be
expect
,
and
again
when
Napoleon
threaten
an
invasion
,
the
place
be
constantly
watch
.
<EOS>
yet
nowadays
,
except
for
the
coastguard
,
it
have
be
utterly
unprotected
and
neglect
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
very
first
soldier
who
land
form
up
quickly
,
and
under
the
charge
of
an
officer
run
up
the
low
hill
to
the
coastguard
station
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
in
order
to
prevent
them
signal
a
warning
.
<EOS>
the
funny
thing
be
,
however
,
that
the
coastguard
have
already
be
hold
up
by
several
well
-
dress
man
--
spy
of
the
Germans
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
I
could
distinctly
see
one
man
hold
one
of
the
guard
with
his
back
to
the
wall
,
and
threaten
him
with
a
revolver
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ted
<EOS>
and
I
have
somehow
be
surround
by
the
crowd
of
odd
craft
which
dodge
about
everywhere
,
and
the
foreigner
now
and
then
shout
to
me
word
that
unfortunately
I
could
not
understand
.
 
<EOS>
"
meanwhile
,
from
all
the
boat
string
out
along
the
beach
,
from
Sheringham
right
across
to
the
Rocket
House
at
Salthouse
,
swarm
of
drab
-
coat
soldier
be
disembark
,
the
boat
immediately
return
to
the
steamer
for
more
.
<EOS>
They
must
have
be
pack
as
tightly
as
herring
in
a
barrel
;
but
they
all
seem
to
know
where
to
go
to
,
because
all
along
at
various
place
little
flag
be
hold
by
man
,
and
each
regiment
appear
to
march
across
and
assemble
at
its
own
flag
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ted
<EOS>
and
I
sit
there
as
if
we
be
watch
a
play
.
<EOS>
suddenly
we
see
from
some
of
the
ship
and
<EOS>
big
barge
horse
be
lower
into
the
water
and
allow
to
swim
ashore
.
<EOS>
hundred
seem
to
gain
the
beach
even
as
we
be
look
at
them
.
<EOS>
then
,
after
the
first
lot
of
horse
have
go
,
boat
full
of
saddle
follow
them
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
though
the
foreigner
be
too
busy
to
notice
us
,
and
we
--
not
want
to
share
the
fate
of
Mr.
Gunter
,
the
coastguard
,
and
his
mate
--
just
sit
tight
and
watch
.
 
<EOS>
"
from
the
steamer
there
continue
to
pour
hundred
upon
hundred
of
soldier
,
who
be
tow
to
land
,
and
then
form
up
in
solid
square
,
which
get
big
and
big
.
<EOS>
horse
innumerable
--
quite
a
thousand
,
I
should
reckon
--
be
sling
overboard
from
some
of
the
small
steamer
which
have
be
run
high
and
dry
on
the
beach
,
and
as
the
tide
have
now
begin
to
run
down
,
they
land
only
knee
-
deep
in
water
.
<EOS>
those
steamer
,
it
seem
to
me
,
have
big
bilge
keel
,
for
as
the
tide
ebb
they
do
not
heel
over
.
<EOS>
They
have
,
no
doubt
,
be
specially
fit
for
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
out
of
some
they
begin
to
hoist
all
sort
of
thing
,
wagon
,
gun
,
motor
-
car
,
large
bale
of
fodder
,
clothing
,
ambulance
with
big
red
crosse
on
them
,
flat
-
look
boat
--
pontoon
I
think
they
call
them
--
and
great
pile
of
cook
pot
and
pan
,
square
box
of
store
,
or
perhaps
ammunition
,
and
as
soon
as
anything
be
land
it
be
haul
up
above
high
-
water
mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
in
the
meantime
lot
of
man
have
mount
on
horseback
and
ride
off
up
the
lane
which
lead
into
Weybourne
village
.
<EOS>
at
first
half
a
dozen
start
at
a
time
;
then
,
as
far
as
I
could
judge
,
about
fifty
more
start
.
<EOS>
then
large
body
go
forward
,
but
more
and
more
horse
keep
go
ashore
,
as
though
their
number
be
never
-
end
.
<EOS>
They
must
have
be
stow
mighty
close
,
and
many
of
the
ship
must
have
be
specially
fit
up
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
very
soon
I
see
cavalry
swarm
up
over
Muckleburgh
,
Warborough
,
and
Telegraph
Hills
,
while
a
good
many
trot
away
in
the
direction
of
Runton
and
Sheringham
.
<EOS>
then
,
soon
after
they
have
go
--
that
is
,
in
about
an
hour
and
a
half
from
their
first
arrival
--
the
infantry
begin
to
move
off
,
and
as
far
as
I
could
see
,
they
march
inland
by
every
road
,
some
in
the
direction
of
Kelling
Street
and
Holt
,
other
over
Weybourne
Heath
towards
Bodham
,
and
still
other
skirt
the
wood
over
to
Upper
Sheringham
.
<EOS>
large
masse
of
infantry
march
along
the
Sheringham
Road
,
and
seem
to
have
a
lot
of
officer
on
horseback
with
them
,
while
up
on
Muckleburgh
Hill
I
see
frantic
signalling
in
progress
.
 
<EOS>
"
by
this
time
they
have
a
quantity
of
cart
and
wagon
land
,
and
a
large
number
of
motor
-
car
.
<EOS>
the
latter
be
soon
start
,
and
,
man
by
infantry
,
move
swiftly
in
procession
after
the
troop
.
<EOS>
the
great
idea
of
the
Germans
be
apparently
to
get
the
beach
clear
of
everything
as
soon
as
land
,
for
all
store
,
equipment
,
and
other
tackle
be
push
inland
as
soon
as
disembark
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
enemy
keep
on
landing
.
<EOS>
thousand
of
soldier
get
ashore
without
any
check
,
and
all
proceed
orderly
and
without
the
slight
confusion
,
as
though
the
plan
be
absolutely
perfect
.
<EOS>
everybody
seem
to
know
exactly
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
from
where
we
be
we
could
see
the
coastguard
hold
prisoner
in
their
station
,
with
german
sentry
mount
around
;
and
as
the
tide
be
now
set
strong
to
the
westward
,
Ted
<EOS>
and
I
just
let
our
anchor
off
the
ground
and
allow
ourselves
to
drift
.
<EOS>
It
occur
to
me
that
perhaps
I
may
be
able
give
the
alarm
at
some
other
coastguard
station
if
I
could
only
drift
away
unnoticed
in
the
busy
scene
now
in
progress
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
the
Germans
have
actually
land
in
England
now
apparent
;
yet
we
wonder
what
our
own
fleet
could
be
do
,
and
picture
to
ourselves
the
jolly
good
drubbing
that
our
cruiser
would
give
the
audacious
foreigner
when
they
do
haul
in
sight
.
<EOS>
It
be
for
us
,
at
all
cost
,
to
give
the
alarm
,
so
gradually
we
drift
off
to
the
nor'-westward
,
in
fear
every
moment
lest
we
should
be
notice
and
fire
at
.
<EOS>
at
last
we
get
around
Blakeney
Point
successfully
,
and
breathe
more
freely
;
then
hoist
our
sail
,
we
head
for
Hunstanton
,
but
see
number
of
ship
enter
the
Wash
,
and
believe
them
to
be
also
Germans
,
we
put
our
helm
down
and
run
across
into
Wainfleet
Swatchway
to
Gibraltar
Point
,
where
I
see
the
chief
officer
of
coastguard
and
tell
him
all
the
extraordinary
event
of
that
memorable
morning
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
report
add
that
the
officer
of
coastguard
in
question
have
,
three
hour
before
,
notice
strange
vessel
come
up
the
Wash
,
and
have
already
try
to
report
by
telegraph
to
his
divisional
inspect
officer
at
Harwich
,
but
could
obtain
no
communication
.
<EOS>
an
hour
later
,
however
,
it
have
become
apparent
that
a
still
further
landing
be
be
effect
on
the
south
side
of
the
Wash
,
in
all
probability
at
King
's
Lynn
.
 
<EOS>
the
fisherman
Scotney
's
statement
have
be
send
by
special
messenger
from
Wainfleet
on
Sunday
evening
,
but
owe
to
the
dislocation
of
the
railway
traffic
north
of
London
,
the
messenger
be
unable
to
reach
the
office
of
the
coastguard
in
Victoria
Street
,
Westminster
,
until
Monday
.
<EOS>
the
report
receive
by
the
Admiralty
have
be
treat
as
confidential
until
corroborate
,
lest
undue
public
alarm
should
be
cause

"
on
Sunday
morning
,
September
2
,
I
have
arrange
to
play
a
round
of
golf
with
my
friend
Somers
,
of
Beeleigh
,
before
church
.
<EOS>
I
meet
him
at
the
Golf
Hut
about
8.30
.
<EOS>
We
play
one
round
,
and
be
at
the
last
hole
but
three
in
a
second
round
when
we
both
think
we
hear
the
sound
of
shot
fire
somewhere
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
We
could
not
make
anything
at
all
of
it
,
and
as
we
have
so
nearly
finish
the
round
,
we
think
we
would
do
so
before
go
to
inquire
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
make
my
approach
to
the
final
hole
when
an
exclamation
from
somer
spoilt
my
stroke
.
<EOS>
I
feel
annoyed
,
but
as
I
look
around
--
doubtless
somewhat
irritably
--
my
eye
turn
in
the
direction
in
which
I
now
see
my
friend
be
point
with
every
expression
of
astonishment
in
his
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
who
on

those
fellow
?

<EOS>
he
ask
.
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
I
be
too
dumbfound

<EOS>
gallop
over
the

from
the
direction
of
the
town
come
three
man

soldier

<EOS>
I

They

up

Herr

<EOS>
inquire
I
in

<EOS>
"
He
drop
a
little
of
his
frill
when
he
hear
me
speak
in
his
native
language
,
ask
which
of
us
be
the
Mayor
,
and
condescend
to
explain
that
I
be
require
in
Maldon
by
the
officer
at
present
in
command
of
his
Imperial
Majesty
<EOS>
the
Kaiser
's
force
occupy
that
place
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
look
at
my
captor
in
complete
bewilderment
.
<EOS>
Could
he
be
some
fellow
try
to
take
a
rise
out
of
me
by
masquerade
as
a
german
officer
?
<EOS>
but
no
,
I
recognise
at
once
that
he
be
the
genuine
article
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
demand
my
parole
,
which
I
make
no
difficulty
about
give
,
since
I
do
not
see
any
way
of
escape
,
and
in
any
case
be
only
too
anxious
to
get
back
to
town
to
see
how
thing
be
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
but
you
do
not
want
my
friend
,
do
you
--
he
live
out
the
other
way
?
'
<EOS>
I
query
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
I
do
not
want
him
,
but
he
will
have
to
come
all
the
same
,
'
rejoin
the
German
.
'
<EOS>
It
be
not
likely
we
be
go
to
let
him
get
away
to
give
the
alarm
in
Colchester
,
be
it
?
'
 
<EOS>
"
obviously
it
be
not
,
and
without
more
ado
we
start
off
at
a
sharp
walk
,
hold
on
to
the
stirrup
leather
of
the
horseman
.
 
<EOS>
"
as
we
enter
the
town
there
be
on
the
bridge
over
the
river
,
a
small
picket
of
blue
-
coated
german
infantry
.
<EOS>
the
whole
thing
be
a
perfect
nightmare
.
<EOS>
It
be
past
belief
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
how
on

do
you
get
here
?
'
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
ask
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
by
water
,
'
he
answer
shortly
,
point
down
the
river
as
he
speak
,
where
I
be
still
further
astonish
--
if
it
be
possible
after
such
a
morning
--
to
see
several
steam
pinnace
and
boat
fly
the
black
and
white
german
ensign
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
conduct
straight
to
the
Moot
Hall
.
<EOS>
there
I
find
a
grizzled
veteran
wait
on
the
step
,
who
turn
round
and
enter
the
building
as
we
come
up
.
<EOS>
We
follow
him
inside
,
and
I
be
introduce
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
appear
to
be
a
truculent
old
ruffian
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
well
,
Mr.
Mayor
,
'
he
say
,
pull
viciously
at
his
white
moustache
,
'
do
you
know
that
I
have
a
great
mind
to
take
you
out
into
the
street
and
have
you
shoot
?
'
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
at
all
incline
to
be
browbeat
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
indeed
,
Herr
Hauptman
?
'
<EOS>
I
answer
.
'
<EOS>
and
may
I
inquire
in
what
way
I
have
incur
the
displeasure
of
the
Hochwohlgeboren
officer
?
'
 
<EOS>
"
'
do
not
trifle
with
me
,
sir
.
<EOS>
why
do
you
allow
your
miserable
volunteer
to
come
out
and
shoot
my
man
?
'
 
<EOS>
"
'
My
volunteer
?
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
I
do
not
understand
what
you
mean
,
'
I
say
.
<EOS>
'
I
be
not
a
Volunteer
officer
.
<EOS>
even
if
I
be
,
I
should
have
no
cognisance
of
anything
that
have
happen
within
the
last
two
hour
,
as
I
have
be
down
on
the
golf
course
.
<EOS>
this
officer
will
bear
me
out
,
'
I
add
,
turn
to
my
captor
.
<EOS>
He
admit
that
he
have
find
me
there
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
but
,
anyway
,
you
be
the
Mayor
,
'
persist
my
interrogator
.
'
<EOS>
why
do
you
allow
the
Volunteers
to
come
out
?
'
 
<EOS>
"
'
if
you
have
be
good
enough
to
inform
us
of
your
visit
,
we
may
have
make
well
arrangement
.
'
<EOS>
I
answer
;
'
but
in
any
case
you
must
understand
that
a
mayor
have
little
or
no
authority
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
His
job
be
to
head
subscription
-
list
,
eat
a
dinner
or
two
,
and
make
speech
on
public
occasion
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
He
seem
to
have
some
difficulty
in
swallow
this
,
but
as
another
officer
who
be
there
,
write
at
a
table
,
and
who
,
it
appear
,
have
live
at
some
period
in
England
,
corroborate
my
statement
,
the
choleric
colonel
seem
to
be
a
little
mollified
,
and
content
himself
with
demand
my
parole
not
to
leave
Maldon
until
he
have
report
the
matter
to
the
General
for
decision
.
<EOS>
I
give
it
without
more
ado
,
and
then
ask
if
he
would
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
what
have
happen
.
<EOS>
from
what
he
tell
me
,
and
what
I
hear
afterwards
,
it
seem
that
the
Germans
must
have
land
a
few
of
their
man
about
half
an
hour
before
I
leave
home
,
down
near
the
Marine
Lake
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
enter
the
town
at
once
,
as
their
object
be
to
work
round
outside
and
occupy
all
entrance
,
to
prevent
anyone
get
away
with
the
news
of
their
presence
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
notice
the
little
lane
lead
to
the
golf
course
,
and
so
I
have
go
down
without
meet
any
of
them
,
although
they
have
actually
get
a
picket
just
beyond
the
railway
arch
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
They
have
complete
their
cordon
before
there
be
any
general
alarm
in
the
town
,
but
at
the
first
reliable
rumour
it
seem
that
young
Shand
,
of
the
Essex
Volunteers
,
have
contrive
to
get
together
twenty
or
thirty
of
his
man
in
their
uniform
and
foolishly
open
fire
on
a
german
picket
down
by
St.
Mary
's
Church
.
<EOS>
They
fall
back
,
but
be
almost
instantly
reinforce
by
a
whole
company
that
have
just
land
,
and
our
man
,
rush
forward
,
have
be
ride
into
by
some
cavalry
that
come
up
a
side
street
.
<EOS>
They
be
disperse
,
a
couple
of
them
be
kill
,
and
several
wound
,
among
them
poor
Shand
,
who
be
hit
in
the
right
lung
.
<EOS>
They
have
bag
four
Germans
,
however
,
and
their
command
officer
be
furious
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
that
it
happen
,
as
it
could
not
possibly
have
be
of
any
use
.
<EOS>
but
it
seem
that
Shand
have
no
idea
that
it
be
more
than
a
very
small
detachment
that
have
land
from
a
gun
-
boat
that
some
one
say
they
have
see
down
the
river
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
Volunteers
be
capture
afterwards
and
send
off
as
prisoner
,
and
the
Germans
post
up
a
notice
that
all
volunteer
be
forthwith
to
surrender
either
themselves
or
their
arm
and
uniform
,
under
pain
of
death
.
<EOS>
Most
of
them
do
the
latter
.
<EOS>
They
could
do
nothing
after
it
be
find
that
the
Germans
have
a
perfect
army
somewhere
between
Maldon
and
the
sea
,
and
be
pour
troop
into
the
town
as
fast
as
they
could
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
very
morning
a
Saxon
rifle
battalion
arrive
from
the
direction
of
Mundon
,
and
just
afterwards
a
lot
spike
-
helmete
gentleman
come
in
by
train
from
Wickford
way
.
<EOS>
so
it
go
on
all
day
,
until
the
whole
town
be
in
a
perfect
uproar
.
<EOS>
the
infantry
be
billet
in
the
town
,
but
the
cavalry
and
guns
cross
the
river
and
canal
at
Heybridge
,
and
go
off
in
the
direction
of
Witham
.
 
<EOS>
"
Maldon
be
build
on
a
hill
that
slope
gradually
towards
the
east
and
south
,
but
rise
somewhat
abruptly
on
the
west
and
north
,
hump
up
a
shoulder
,
as
it
be
,
to
the
north
-
west
.
<EOS>
at
this
corner
they
start
to
dig
entrenchment
just
after
one
o'clock
,
and
soon
officer
and
orderly
be
busy
all
round
the
town
,
plot
,
measure
,
and
set
up
mark
of
one
kind
and
another
.
<EOS>
other
troop
appear
to
be
busy
down
in
Heybridge
,
but
what
they
be
do
I
could
not
tell
,
as
no
one
be
allow
to
cross
the
bridge
over
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
german
officer
who
have
surprise
me
down
on
the
golf
course
do
not
turn
out
to
be
a
bad
kind
of
youth
on
further
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
Captain
von
Hildebrandt
,
of
the
Guard
Fusilier
Regiment
,
who
be
employ
on
the
staff
,
though
in
what
capacity
he
do
not
say
.
<EOS>
think
it
be
just
as
well
to
make
the
good
of
a
bad
job
,
I
invite
him
to
lunch
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
have
to
be
off
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
introduce
me
to
three
friend
of
his
in
the
101st
Grenadiers
,
who
,
he
suggest
,
should
be
billet
on
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
the
idea
a
fairly
good
one
,
and
Von
Hildebrandt
,
have
apparently
arrange
this
with
the
billet
officer
without
any
difficulty
,
I
take
them
home
with
me
to
lunch
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
find
my
wife
and
family
in
a
great
state
of
mind
,
both
on
account
of
the
untoward
happening
of
the
morning
and
my
non
-
return
from
golf
at
the
expect
time
.
<EOS>
They
have
imagine
all
sort
of
thing
which
may
have
befall
me
,
but
luckily
seem
not
to
have
hear
of
my
adventure
with
the
choleric
colonel
.
<EOS>
Our
three
foreigner
soon
make
themselves
very
much
at
home
,
but
as
they
be
undeniably
gentleman
,
they
contrive
to
be
about
as
agreeable
as
could
be
expect
under
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
their
presence
be
to
a
great
extent
a
safeguard
against
annoyance
,
as
the
stable
and
back
premise
be
stuff
full
of
soldier
,
who
may
have
be
very
troublesome
<EOS>
have
they
not
be
there
to
keep
them
in
order

<EOS>
"
of
what
be
happen
up
in
London
we
know
nothing

<EOS>
be
Sunday
,
all
the
shop
be
shut
;
but
I
go
out
and
contrive
to
lay
in
a
considerable
stock
of
provision
one
way
and
another
,
and
it
be
just
as
well
<EOS>
I
do
,
for
I
only
just
anticipate
the
Germans
,
who
commandeer
everything
in
the
town
,
and
put
everybody
on
an
allowance
of
ration
.
<EOS>
They
pay
for
them
with
bill
on
the
British
Government
,
which
be
by
no
mean
acceptable
to
the
shopkeeper
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
'
<EOS>
Hobson
's
choice'--that
or
nothing
.
<EOS>
the
Germans
soothe
them
by
say
that
the
British
Army
would
be
smash
in
a
couple
of
week
,
and
the
defrayment
of
such
bill
would
be
among
the
condition
of
peace

<EOS>
the
troop
generally
seem
to
be
well
-
behave
,
and
treat
those
inhabitant
with
whom
they
come
in
contact
in
an
unexceptionable
manner
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
see
very
much
of
them
,
however
,
as
they
be
keep
hard
at
work
all
day
with
their
entrenchment
and
be
not
allow
out
of
their
billet
after
eight
o'clock
that
evening

no
one

allow

hour

two

three
people
be
shoot
by
the
sentry
as
they
try
to
break
out
in
one
direction
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
these
affair
produce
a
feeling
of
horror
and
indignation
in
the
town
,
as
Englishmen
,
have
such
a
long
experience
of
peace
in
their
own
country
,
have
always
refuse
to
realise
what
war

presently
three

Scotney

hardly
any

<EOS>
the
whole

burn
fiercely

the

prove

no

it
appear

use
petrol
bomb
with
appalling

spread
fire

disaster

and
death
everywhere

<EOS>
the

with
only
the

have
scatter

that

Tyne

hoist
the

Emden

supply

the
whole

bad
of

the
awful
truth

the

have
establish

the

the

Most

the

of
Mr.

in
Essex

the
strong
position
they
occupy

<EOS>
It
run
as
below
:
 
<EOS>
"
of
the
event
of
the
early
hour
of
the
morning
I
have
no
very
clear
recollection
.
<EOS>
I
be
bewilder
,
stagger
,
dumbfound
by
the
sight
and
sound
which
beset
me
.
<EOS>
of
what
modern
war
mean
I
have
till
then
truly
but
a
very
faint
idea
.
<EOS>
to
witness
its
horrid
reality
enact
in
this
quiet
,
out
-
of
-
the

way
spot
where
I
have
pitch
my
tent
for
so
many
year
,
bring
them
home
to
me
literally
as
well
as
metaphorically
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
run
down
Cromwell
Hill
,
and
see
the
flame
of
Heybridge
,
be
impel
to
get
near
,
if
possible
,
to
discover
more
particularly
the
state
of
affair
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
reckon
without
the
Germans
.
<EOS>
when
I
get
to
the
bridge
over
the
river
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
the
officer
in
charge
there
absolutely
prevent
my
crossing
.
<EOS>
beyond
the
soldier
stand
or
kneel
behind
whatever
cover
be
offer
by
the
wall
and
building
abut
on
the
riverside
,
and
a
couple
of
machine
gun
place
so
as
to
command
the
bridge
and
the
road
beyond
,
there
be
nothing
much
to
see
.
<EOS>
a
number
of
Germans
be
,
however
,
very
busy
in
the
big
mill
just
across
the
river
,
but
what
they
be
do
I
could
not
make
out
.
<EOS>
as
I
turn
to
retrace
my
step
the
glare
of
the
conflagration
grow
suddenly
more
and
more
intense
.
<EOS>
a
mass
of
dark
figure
come
run
down
the
brightly
illuminate
road
towards
the
bridge
,
while
the
rifle
fire
become
louder
,
near
,
and
heavier
than
ever
.
<EOS>
every
now
and
again
the
air
become
alive
with
,
as
it
be
,
the
hiss
and
buzz
of
fly
insect
.
<EOS>
the
English
must
have
fight
their
way
through
Heybridge
,
and
these
must
be
the
bullet
from
their
rifle
.
<EOS>
It
be
dangerous
to
stay
down
there
any
longer
,
so
I
take
to
my
heel
.
<EOS>
as
I
run
I
hear
a
thundering
explosion
behind
me
,
the
shock
of
which
nearly
throw
me
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
look
over
my
shoulder
,
I
see
that
the
Germans
have
blow
up
the
mill
at
the
farther
end
of
the
bridge
,
and
be
now
push
cart
from
either
side
in
order
to
barricade
it
.
<EOS>
the
two
Maxims
,
too
,
begin
to
pump
lead
with
their
hammering
report
,
and
the
man
near
them
commence
to
fall
in
two
and
three
.
<EOS>
I
make
off
to
the
left
,
and
pass
into
High
Street
by
the
end
of
St.
Peter
's
Church
,
now
disuse
.
<EOS>
at
the
corner
I
run
against
Mr.
Clydesdale
,
the
optician
,
who
look
after
the
library
which
now
occupy
the
old
building
.
<EOS>
He
point
to
the
tower
,
which
stand
darkly
up
against
the
blood
-
red
sky
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
look
at
those
infernal
Germans
!
'
<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
'
They
can
not
even
keep
out
of
that
old
place

<EOS>
I
wish
we
could
have
get
the
book
out
before
they
come
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
see
any
of
our
invader
where
he
be
point
,
but
presently
I
become
aware
of
a
little
winking
,
blink
light
at
the
very
summit
of
the
tower
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
that
be
them

Clydesdale

They
be

I

<EOS>
My
boy
say
he
see
the
same
thing
on
Purleigh
Church
tower
last
night
.
<EOS>
I
wish
it
would
come
down
with
them
,
that
I
do
.
<EOS>
It
be
pretty
shaky
,
anyway
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
the
street
be
fairly
full
of
people
.
<EOS>
the
Germans
,
it
be
true
,
have
order
that
no
one
should
be
out
of
door
between
eight
in
the
evening
and
six
in
the
morning
;
but
just
now
they
appear
to
have
their
hand
pretty
full
elsewhere
,
and
if
any
of
the
few
soldier
that
be
about
knew
of
or
think
anything
of
the
interdiction
,
they
say
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
crash
of
a
salvo
of
heavy
gun
from
the
direction
of
my
own
house
interrupt
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
that
will
be
the
gun
in

"
'
yes

they
have
get
three
monstrous

Clydesdale

the

out

after

the
light
at
the
top
have
disappear
and
the
lofty
edifice
be
sway
slowly
,
slowly
,
over
to
the
left

<EOS>
"
'
She
be

<EOS>
exclaim
Clydesdale

<EOS>
"
It
be
true
.
<EOS>
down
come
the
old
steeple
that
have
point
heavenward
for
so
many
generation
,
with
a
mighty
crash
and
concussion
that
swallow
up
even
the
noise
of
the
battle
,
though
cannon
of
all
sort
and
size
be
now
join
in
the
hellish
concert
,
and
shell
from
the
english
battery
begin
to
roar
over
the
town
.
<EOS>
the
vibration
and
shock
of
the
heavy
gun
have
be
too
much
for
the
old
tower
,
which
,
for
year
in
a
tottery
condition
,
have
be
patch
up
so
often
.
 
<EOS>
"
as
soon
as
the
cloud
of
dust
clear
off
we
run
towards
the
huge
pile
of
debris
that
fill
the
little
churchyard
.
<EOS>
several
other
people
follow
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
dark
down
there
,
in
the
shadow
of
the
tree
and
house
,
despite
the
fire
-
light
overhead
,
and
we
begin
strike
match
as
we
look
about
among
the
heap
of
brick
and
beam
to
see
if
there
be
any
of
the
german
signal
party
among
them
.
<EOS>
why
we
should
have
take
the
trouble
under
the
circumstance
I
do
not
quite
know
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
instinctive
movement
of
humanity
on
my
part
,
and
that
of
most
of
the
other
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
catch
sight
of
an
arm
in
a
light
blue
sleeve
protrude
from
the
debris
,
and
take
hold
of
it
in
a
futile
attempt
to
remove
some
of
the
brick
and
rubbish
which
I
think
be
cover
the
body
of
its
owner
.
<EOS>
to
my
horror
,
it
come
away
in
my
hand
.
<EOS>
the
body
to
which
it
belong
may
be
bury
yard
away
in
the
immense
heap
of
ruin
.
<EOS>
I
drop
it
with
a
cry
,
and
flee
from
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dawn
be
now
break
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
exactly
remember
where
I
wander
to
after
the
fall
of
St.
Peter
's
Tower
,
but
it
must
have
be
between
half
-
past
five
and
six
when
I
find
myself
on
the
high
ground
at
the
north
-
western
corner
of
the
town
,
overlook
the
golf
link
,
where
I
have
spend
so
many
pleasant
hour
in
that
recent
past
that
now
seem
so
far
away
.
<EOS>
all
around
me
be
battery
,
trench
,
and
gun
-
pit
.
<EOS>
but
though
the
firing
be
still
go
on
somewhere
away
to
the
right
,
where
Heybridge
pour
black
smoke
skyward
like
a
volcano
,
gun
and
howitzer
be
silent
,
and
their
attendant
artillerymen
,
instead
of
be
in
cover
behind
their
earthen
parapet
,
be
cluster
on
the
top
,
watch
intently
something
that
be
pass
in
the
valley
below
them

<EOS>
so
absorb
be
they
that
I
be
able
to
creep
up
behind
them
,
and
also
get
a
sight
of
what
be
take
place
.
<EOS>
and
this
be
what
I
see
:
 
"
over
the
railway
bridge

span
the
river
a
little
to
the
left
be
hurry
battalion
after
battalion
of
green
and
blue
clothe
german
infantry

<EOS>
They
move
down
the
embankment
after
cross
,
and
continue
their
march
behind
it

<EOS>
where
the
railway
curve
to
the
right
and
leave
,
about
half
a
mile
beyond
the
bridge
,
the
top
of
the
embankment
be
line
with
dark
figure
lie
down
and
apparently
fire
,
while
over
the
golf
course
from
the
direction
of
Beeleigh
trot
squadron
after
squadron
of
sky
-
blue
rider
,
their
green
and
white
lance
pennon
flutter
in

They
cross
the
Blackwater
and
Chelmer
Canal
,
and
canter
off
in
the
direction
of
Langford
Rectory

<EOS>
"
at
the
same
time
I
see
line
after
line
of
the
Germans
mass
behind
the
embankment
spring
over
it
and
advance
rapidly
towards
the
low
portion
of
the
town

just
across
the
river

<EOS>
hundred
fall
under
the
fire
from
the
house
,
which
must
have
be
full
of
Englishmen
,
but
one
line
after
another
reach
the
building
.
<EOS>
the
firing
be
now
heavy
than
ever
--
absolutely
incessant
and
continuous
--
though
,
except
for
an
occasional
discharge
from
beyond
Heybridge
,
the
artillery
be
silent

I
have
but
<EOS>
little
knowledge
of
military
matter
,
but
it
be
abundantly
evident
,
even
to
me
,
that
what
I
have
just
see
be
a
very
formidable
counter
-
attack
on
the
part
of
the
Germans
,
who
have
bring
up
fresh
troop
either
from
the
rear
of
the
town

from
farther
inland

and
launch
them
against
the
English
under
cover

the
railway
embankment

I
be
not
able
to
see
the
end
of
the
encounter
,

bad
news
fly
apace
,
and
it
soon
become
common
knowledge
in
the
town
that
our
troop
from
Colchester
have
not
only
fail
to
cross
the
river
at
any
point

but
have
be
drive
helter

skelter
out
of
the
low
town
near
the
station

from
the
smoking
ruin
of
Heybridge
with
great
loss

be
now
in
full
retreat

about
six
o'clock
this
morning
I
awake
rather
suddenly
.
<EOS>
the
wind
have
go
round
to
the
northward

and
I
be
certain
that
heavy
firing
be
go
on
somewhere
in
that
direction

<EOS>
I
open
the
window
and
look
out

<EOS>
the
'
thud
'
and
rumble
of
a
cannonade
,
with
the
accompaniment
of
an
occasional
burst
of
musketry
,
come
clearly
and
loudly
on
the
wind
from
the
hill
by
Wickham
Bishops
village

<EOS>
the
church
spire
be
in
plain
view
,
and
little
faint
puff
and
ring
of
grey
smoke
be
just
visible
in
its
vicinity
every
now
and
again
,
sometimes
high
up
in
the
air

at
other
among
the
tree
at
its
base

They
be
explode
shell
;
I
have
no
doubt
of
that
.
<EOS>
what
be
go
on
it
be
impossible
to
say
,
but
I
conjecture
that
some
of
our
troop
from
Colchester
have
come
into
collision
with
the
Germans
,
who
have
go
out
in
that
direction
the
day
of
their
arrival

firing
continue
for
about
an
hour

away

after
eight

appear
to
be

send
for

I
should
take
step
to
arrange
for
the
manufacture
of
lint

bandage
by
the

I
could
see
no
reason
for
object
to
this
,

so
promise
to
carry
out
his
suggestion

<EOS>
I
set
about
the
matter
at
once
,

,
with
the
assistance
of
my
wife

soon
have
a

more

busily

forth
again

roof
.
<EOS>
the
top
of
the
Moot
Hall
and
other
coign
of
vantage
have
all
be
occupy
by
the
Germans
.
<EOS>
however
,
with
the
aid
of
a
pair
of
field
-
glass
<EOS>
I
be
able
to
see
a
good
bit
.
<EOS>
black
smoke
be
now
pour
from
Wickham
Bishops
in
cloud
,
and
every
now
and
again
I
fancy
I
could
see
the
fork
tongue
of
flame
shoot
up
above
the
surround
tree
.
<EOS>
a
series
of
scatter
black
dot
now
come
out
on
the
open
ground
to
the
south
of
the
church
.
<EOS>
the
tree
of
Eastland
Wood
soon
hide
them
from
my
sight
,
but
other
follow
,
mingle
with
little
move
black
block
which
I
take
to
be
form
body
of
troop
.
<EOS>
after
them
come
four
or
five
gun
,
drive
at
breakneck
pace
towards
the
road
that
pass
between
Eastland
and
Captain
's
Woods
,
then
more
black
dot
,
also
in
a
desperate
hurry
.
<EOS>
several
of
these
last
tumble
,
and
lie
still
here
<EOS>
and
there
all
over
the
slope
.
 
<EOS>
"
other
dot
follow
at
their
heel
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
quite
so
distinct
.
<EOS>
I
look
harder
.
<EOS>
Hurrah
!
<EOS>
They
be
man
in
khaki
.
<EOS>
We
be
hustle
these
Germans
at
last
.
<EOS>
They
also
disappear
behind
the
wood
.
<EOS>
then
from
the
fringe
of
tree
about
Wickham
half
a
dozen
big
brilliant
flash
,
follow
after
an
interval
by
the
loud
detonation
of
heavy
cannon
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
distinguish
much
more
,
though
the
rattle
of
battle
go
on
for
some
time
longer
.
<EOS>
soon
after
eleven
four
german
gun
gallop
in
from
Heybridge
.
<EOS>
these
be
follow
by
a
procession
of
maimed
and
limp
humanity
.
<EOS>
some
manage
to
get
along
unaided
,
though
with
considerable
difficulty
.
<EOS>
other
be
support
by
a
comrade
,
some
carry
between
two
man
,
and
other
borne
along
on
stretcher
.
<EOS>
a
couple
of
ambulance
cart
trot
out
and
pick
up
more
wounded
.
<EOS>
Our
bandage
and
lint
have
not
long
to
wait
before
be
require
.
<EOS>
after
this
there
be
a
cessation
of
firing
.
 
<EOS>
"
about
one
o'clock
the
german
general
send
word
to
me
that
he
think
an
attack
quite
possible
during
the
afternoon
,
and
that
he
strongly
advise
me
to
get
all
the
woman
and
child
out
of
the
town
--
for
the
time
be
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
this
be
evidently
well
mean
,
but
it
be
a
pretty
difficult
matter
to
arrange
for
,
to
say
nothing
of
raise
a
panic
among
the
inhabitant
.
<EOS>
however
,
in
an
hour
and
a
half
's
time
I
have
contrive
to
marshal
several
hundred
of
them
together
,
and
to
get
them
out
on
the
road
to
Mundon
.
<EOS>
the
weather
be
warm
for
the
time
of
the
year
,
and
I
think
,
if
the
bad
come
to
the
bad
,
they
could
spend
the
night
in
the
old
church
.
<EOS>
I
leave
the
sad
little
column
of
exile
--
old
,
bent
woman
help
along
by
their
daughter
,
tiny
child
drag
along
through
the
dust
,
clutch
their
mother
'
skirt
;
infant
in
arm
;
and
other
old
and
sturdy
child
stagger
beneath
the
weight
of
the
most
precious
home
adornment
--
and
make
the
good
of
my
way
back
to
arrange
for
the
forwarding
to
them
of
their
ration
.
 
<EOS>
"
at
every
step
on
my
homeward
way
I
expect
to
hear
the
cannonade
begin
again
.
<EOS>
but
beyond
the
twittering
of
the
bird
in
the
tree
and
hedgerow
,
the
creak
and
rumble
of
a
pass
cart
,
and
the
rush
of
a
train
along
the
railway
on
my
left
--
just
the
usual
sound
of
the
countryside
--
nothing
break
the
stillness
.
<EOS>
as
I
step
out
on
the
familiar
highway
,
I
could
almost
bring
myself
to
believe
that
the
event
of
the
past
twenty
-
four
hour
be
but
the
phantasmagoria
of
a
dream
.
<EOS>
after
interview
some
of
the
town
councillor
who
be
go
to
undertake
the
transport
of
provision
to
the
woman
and
child
at
Mundon
,
I
walk
round
to
my
own
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
wife
and
family
have
drive
over
to
Purleigh
on
the
first
alarm
,
and
have
arrange
to
stay
the
night
with
some
friend
,
on
whatever
shake
-
down
could
be
improvise
,
since
every
house
in
the
peninsula
harbour
some
of
the
ubiquitous
german
officer
and
man
.
<EOS>
I
wander
through
the
familiar
room
,
and
come
out
into
the
garden
,
or
rather
,
what
have
be
the
garden
.
<EOS>
there
I
see
that
the
Saxon
gunner
be
all
stand
to
their
piece
,
and
one
of
my
none
too
welcome
<EOS>
guest
accost
me
as
I
leave
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
if
you
will
take
my
advice
,
sare
,
you
will
get
away
out
of
this
,
'
he
say
in
broken
English
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
what
!
<EOS>
be
you
go
to
fire
?
'
<EOS>
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
I
do
not
fancy
so
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
hurt
you
if
we
be
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
your
english
friend
from
Colchester
be
about
to
see
if
they
can
draw
us
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
as
he
speak
I
become
aware
of
a
sharp
,
hiss
noise
like
a
train
let
off
steam
.
<EOS>
It
grow
louder
and
near
,
pass
over
our
head
,
and
be
almost
instantly
follow
by
a
terrible
crash
somewhere
behind
the
house
.
<EOS>
a
deep
and
more
muffled
report
come
up
from
the
valley
beyond
Heybridge
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
well
,
they
have
begin
now
,
and
the
good
thing
you
can
do
be
to
get
down
into
that
gun
epaulment
there
,
'
say
the
german
officer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
his
advice
be
good
,
and
I
lose
no
time
in
follow
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
here
come
another
!
'
<EOS>
cry
he
,
as
he
jump
down
into
the
pit
beside
me
.
'
<EOS>
We
will
have
plenty
of
them
now
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
so
we
do
.
<EOS>
Shell
after
shell
come
hiss
and
scream
at
us
over
the
tree
-
top
in
the
garden
low
down
the
hill
.
<EOS>
each
one
of
them
sound
to
me
as
if
it
be
come
directly
at
my
head
,
but
one
after
another
pass
over
us
to
burst
beyond
.
<EOS>
the
gunner
all
crouch
close
to
the
earthen
parapet
--
and
so
do
I.
<EOS>
I
be
not
ashamed
to
say
so
.
<EOS>
My
german
officer
,
however
,
occasionally
climb
to
the
top
of
the
embankment
and
study
the
prospect
through
his
field
-
glass
.
<EOS>
at
length
there
be
a
loud
detonation
,
and
a
column
of
dirt
and
smoke
in
the
garden
next
below
us
.
<EOS>
then
two
shell
strike
the
parapet
of
the
gun
-
pit
on
our
left
almost
simultaneously
.
<EOS>
Their
explosion
be
deafen
,
and
we
be
cover
with
the
dust
and
stone
they
throw
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
immediately
afterwards
another
shell
pass
so
close
over
our
head
that
I
feel
my
hair
lift
.
<EOS>
It
just
clear
the
parapet
and
plunge
into
the
side
of
my
house
.
<EOS>
a
big
hole
appear
just
to
the
right
of
the
dining
-
room
window
,
and
through
it
come
instantaneously
the
loud
bang
of
the
explosion
.
<EOS>
the
glass
be
shatter
in
all
the
window
,
and
thick
smoke
,
white
and
black
,
come
curl
from
every
one
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
the
house
be
on
fire
!
'
<EOS>
I
shout
,
and
spring
madly
from
the
pit
.
<EOS>
heedless
of
the
bombardment
,
I
rush
into
the
building
.
<EOS>
another
crash
sound
overhead
as
I
enter
,
and
a
blaze
of
light
shine
down
the
stairway
for
an
instant
.
<EOS>
another
projectile
have
find
a
billet
in
my
home
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
make
my
way
to
my
study
,
but
find
the
passage
block
with
fallen
beam
and
ceiling
.
<EOS>
what
with
the
smoke
and
dust
,
and
the
blocking
of
some
of
the
window
,
it
be
very
dark
in
the
hall
,
and
I
get
quite
a
shock
when
,
as
I
look
about
me
to
find
my
way
,
I
see
two
red
,
glitter
speck
shine
over
the
top
of
a
heap
of
debris
.
<EOS>
but
the
howl
that
follow
tell
me
that
they
be
nothing
but
the
eye
of
miserable
Tim
,
the
cat
,
who
,
leave
behind
,
have
be
nearly
frighten
out
of
his
sense
by
the
noise
and
concussion
of
the
burst
shell
.
<EOS>
as
I
gaze
at
him
another
projectile
strike
the
house
quite
close
to
us
.
<EOS>
Tim
be
simply
smash
by
a
flying
fragment
.
<EOS>
I
be
throw
down
,
and
half
-
bury
under
a
shower
of
brick
and
mortar
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
I
must
have
lose
consciousness
for
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
next
thing
I
recollect
be
be
drag
out
into
the
garden
by
a
couple
of
Saxons
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
splitting
headache
,
and
be
very
glad
of
a
glass
of
water
that
one
of
them
hand
to
me
.
<EOS>
Their
officer
,
who
appear
to
be
quite
a
decent
fellow
,
offer
me
his
flask
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
the
house
be
all
right
,
'
he
say
,
with
his
strong
accent
.
'
<EOS>
It
catch
fire
once
,
but
we
manage
to
get
it
under
.
<EOS>
Your
friend
have
clear
off
--
at
any
rate
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
They
get
too
bold
at
last
,
and
push
their
gun
down
till
they
get
take
in
the
flank
by
the
warship
in
the
river
.
<EOS>
They
have
two
of
their
piece
knock
to
bit
,
and
then
clear
out
.
<EOS>
good
thing
you
can
do
be
to
do
the
same
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
in
two
mind
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
save
the
house
by
stay
,
and
may
just
as
well
join
my
people
at
Purleigh
Rectory
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
I
feel
that
it
would
better
become
me
,
as
Mayor
,
to
stick
to
the
town
.
<EOS>
duty
triumph
,
and
I
decide
to
remain
where
I
be
--
at
least
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
all
be
now
quiet
,
and
after
an
early
supper
I
turn
in
,
and
,
despite
the
excitement
of
the
day
and
my
aching
head
,
be
asleep
the
moment
I
touch
the
pillow

WEDNESDAY

September
5
<EOS>

.
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
have
be
about
three
in
the
morning
when
I
awoke
.
<EOS>
My
head
be
much
well
,
and
for
a
minute
or
two
I
lay
comfortably
in
the
darkness
,
without
any
recollection
of
the
event
of
the
precede
day
.
<EOS>
then
I
see
a
bright
reflection
pass
rapidly
over
the
ceiling
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
vaguely
what
it
be
.
<EOS>
presently
it
come
back
again
,
pause
a
moment
,
and
disappear
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
I
be
wide
awake
.
<EOS>
I
go
to
the
window
and
look
out
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
dark
,
but
from
somewhere
over
beyond
Heybridge
a
long
white
ray
be
sweep
all
along
this
side
of
Maldon
.
<EOS>
now
the
foliage
of
a
tree
in
the
garden
below
would
stand
out
in
pale
green
radiance
against
the
blackness
;
now
the
wall
of
a
house
half
a
mile
away
would
reflect
back
the
move
beam
,
shine
white
as
a
sheet
of
notepaper
.
 
<EOS>
"
presently
another
ray
shine
out
,
and
the
two
of
them
,
move
backwards
and
forwards
,
make
the
whole
of
our
hillside
caper
in
a
dizzy
dance
.
<EOS>
from
somewhere
far
away
to
my
right
<EOS>
another
strong
beam
now
stream
through
the
obscurity
,
direct
apparently
at
the
source
of
the
other
two
,
and
almost
simultaneously
come
the
crack
of
a
rifle
from
the
direction
of
Heybridge
,
sharp
and
ominous
in
the
quiet
darkness
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
half
a
dozen
scatter
shot
follow
;
then
a
faint
cheer
.
<EOS>
More
and
more
rifle
join
in
,
and
presently
the
bur
tap
-
tap
-
tap
of
a
Maxim
.
<EOS>
I
hurry
on
my
clothe
.
<EOS>
the
firing
increase
in
volume
and
rapidity
;
bugle
ring
out
here
,
there
,
and
everywhere
through
the
sleeping
town
,
and
above
the
rolling
,
rattle
clamour
of
the
drum
I
could
distinguish
the
hurried
tramp
of
hundred
of
foot
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
cast
one
glance
from
the
window
as
I
quit
the
room
.
<EOS>
the
electric
searchlight
have
increase
to
at

half
a
dozen

<EOS>
some
reach
out
long
,
steady
finger
into
the
vague
space
of
the
night

other
wander
restlessly
up

down

hither

thither

<EOS>
low
down
over
the
tree
of
the
garden
a
dull
red
glare
slowly
increase
in
extent
and
intensity

<EOS>
the
rattle
of
musketry

<EOS>
as
I
run
out
of
the

into

I

nearly
carry
off

by
the
rush
of
a

pour
down
Cromwell
Hill
at

double

hardly
know
what

I
follow
in

the
glare

get
bright

bright

<EOS>
a
few
step
,
and
<EOS>
I
could
see
the
cause

it

<EOS>
the
whole
of
Heybridge
appear
to
be
on
fire

the
flame
roar
skyward
from
a
dozen
different
conflagration

"
 
<EOS>
England
halt
breathless
.
<EOS>
fighting
have
commence
in
real
earnest

<EOS>
the
great
consternation
be
cause
by
the
publication
in
the
"
Times
"
of
the
description
of
the
operation
in
Essex
,
write
by
Mr.
Henry
Bentley
,
the
distinguished
war
correspondent

who
have
serve
that
journal
in

<EOS>
all
other
paper
,
without
exception
,
contain
various
account
of
the
british
defence
at
the
point
near
London
,
but
they
be
mostly
of
the
scrappy
and
sensational
order
,
base
more
on
report
than
upon
actual
fact
.
<EOS>
the
"
Times
"
account
,
however
,
have
be
write
with
calm
impartiality
by
one
of
the
most
experienced
correspondent
at
the
front
.
<EOS>
whether
he
have
be
afford
any
special
facility
be
not
apparent
,
but
,
in
any
case
,
it
be
the
most
complete
and
truthful
account
of
the
gallant
attempt
on
the
part
of
our
soldier
to
check
the
advance
from
Essex
westward
.
 
<EOS>
during
the
whole
of

hot

stifle
day
it
be
know
that
a
battle
be
rage

excitement

intense

anxious
terror

to

day
have
be
a
momentous
one
for
England
.
<EOS>
the
great
battle
have
rage
since
dawn
,
and
though
just
at
present
there
seem
to
be
a
lull
,
during
which
the

so
to
speak
,
regain
their
breath
,
it

be
by
no

over

<EOS>
"
dead
and
live
alike
will
lie
out
on
the
battlefield
the
whole
night
through
,
for
we
must
hold
on
to
the
position
so
hardly
win
,
and
be
ready
to
press
forward
at
the
first
glimmer
of
daylight
.
<EOS>
Our
gallant
troop
,
Regular
and
Volunteers
alike
,
have
nobly
vindicate
the
tradition
of
our
race
,
and
have
fight
as
desperately
as
ever
do
their
forebear
at
Agincourt
,
Albuera
,
or
Waterloo
.
<EOS>
but
while
a
considerable
success
--
pay
for
,
alas
!
<EOS>
by
the
loss
of
thousand
of
gallant
life
--
have
be
achieve
,
it
will
take
at
least
another
day
's
hard
fighting
before
victory
be
in
our
grasp
.
<EOS>
nowadays
a
soldier
nee
not
expect
to
be
either
victorious
or
finally
defeat
by
nightfall
,
and
although
this
battle
,
fight
as
it
be
between
much
small
force
,
and
extend
over
a
much
more
limited
area
,
than
the
great
engagement
between
the
Russians
and
Japanese
at
Liaoyang
,
will
not
take
quite
so
long
a
time
to
decide
<EOS>
,
the
end
be
not
yet
in
sight
.
<EOS>
I
write
this
after
a
hard
day
's
travelling
backwards
and
forwards
behind
our
advance
line
of
battle
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
take
my
cycle
with
me
in
my
motor
-
car
,
and
whenever
opportunity
offer
mount
it
,
and
push
forward
as
near
to
the
fighting
as
I
could
get
.
<EOS>
frequently
I
have
to
leave
the
cycle
also
,
and
crawl
forward
on
hand
and
knee
,
shelter
in
some
depression
in
the
ground
,
while
the
enemy
's
bullet
whine
and
whistle
overhead
.
<EOS>
as
report
in
a
previous
issue
,
the
Army
which
have
assemble
at
Brentwood
move
forward
on
the
5th

during
the
afternoon
the
advanced
troop
succeed
in
drive
the
enemy
out
of
South
Hanningfield
,
and
before
sundown
they
be
also
in
full
retreat
from
the
position
they
have
hold
at
East
Hanningfield
and
Danbury
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
stiff
fighting
at
the
latter
place
,
but
after
a
pounding
from
the
artillery
,
who
bring
several
battery
into
action
on
the
high
ground
north
-
west
of
East
Hanningfield
,
the
Germans
be
unable
to
withstand
the
attack
of
the
Argyll
and
Sutherlands
and
the
London
Scottish
,
who
work
their
way
through
Danbury
Park
and
Hall
Wood
<EOS>
right
into
their
position
,
drive
them
from
their
entrenchment
by
a
dash
bayonet
charge
.
<EOS>
everything
north
and
east
of
the
enemy
's
main
position
,
which
be
now
know
to
lie
north
and
south
,
between
Maldon
and
the
river
Crouch
,
be
now
in
our
hand
,
but
his
troop
still
show
a
stout
front
at
Wickford
,
and
be
also
report
to
be
at
Rayleigh
,
Hockley
,
and
Canewdon
,
several
mile
to
the
eastward
.
<EOS>
all
preparation
be
make
to
assault
the
german
position
at
Wickford
at
daybreak
to
-
day
,
but
our
scout
find
that
the
place
have
be
evacuate
.
<EOS>
the
news
that
Rayleigh
and
Hockley
have
also
be
abandon
by
the
enemy
come
in
shortly
afterwards
.
<EOS>
the
german
invader
have
evidently
complete
their
arrangement
for
the
defence
of
their
main
position
,
and
now
say
,
in
effect
,
'
come
on
,
and
turn
us
out
if
you
can
.

<EOS>

It
be
no
easy
task
that
lie
before
our
gallant
defender
.
<EOS>
Maldon
,
perch
on
a
high
knoll
,
with
a
network
of
river
and
canal
protect
it
from
assault
from
the
northward
,
fairly
bristle
with
gun
,
many
of
them
heavy
field
howitzer
,
and
have
,
as
we
know
to
our
cost
,
already
repulse
one
attack
by
our
troop
.
<EOS>
farther
south
there
be
say
to
be
many
gun
on
the
knoll
about
Purleigh
.
<EOS>
Great
Canney
Hill
,
stand
boldly
up
like
an
immense
redoubt
,
be
report
to
be
seam
with
entrenchment
mount
many
heavy
gun
.
<EOS>
the
railway
embankment
south
of
Maldon
form
a
perfect
natural
rampart
along
part
of
the
enemy
's
position
,
while
the
wood
and
enclosure
south
-
west
of
Great
Canney
conceal
thousand
of
sharpshooter
.
<EOS>
a
sort
of
advanced
position
be
occupy
by
the
enemy
at
Edwin
Hall
,
a
mile
east
of
Woodham
Ferrers
,
where
a
pair
of
high
kopjes
a
quarter
of
a
mile
apart
offer
command
and
cover
to
some
of
their
field
battery
.
 
<EOS>
"
Our
scout
have
discover
also
that
an
elaborate
system
of
wire
entanglement
and
other
military
obstacle
protect
almost
the
whole
front
of
the
somewhat
extensive
german
position
.
<EOS>
on
its
extreme
leave
their
line
be
say
to
be
throw
back
at
an
angle
,
so
that
any
attempt
to
outflank
it
would
not
only
entail
cross
the
river
Crouch
,
but
would
come
under
the
fire
of
battery
place
on
the
high
ground
overlook
it
.
<EOS>
altogether
,
it
be
a
very
tough
nut
to
crack
,
and
the
force
at
our
disposal
none
too
strong
for
the
work
that
lie
before
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
further
detail
regard
our
strength
would
be
inadvisable
for
obvious
reason
,
but
when
I
point
out
that
the
Germans
be
suppose
to
be
between
thirty
and
forty
thousand
strong
,
and
that
it
be
lay
down
by
competent
military
authority
that
to
attack
troop
in
an
entrenched
position
a
superiority
of
six
to
one
be
advisable
,
my
reader
can
draw
their
own
conclusion
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
repair
to
the
railway
line
between
Brentwood
and
Chelmsford
,
that
have
be
damage
by
the
enemy
's
cavalry
on
their
first
landing
,
be
complete
yesterday
,
and
all
night
reinforcement
have
be
come
in
by
way
of
Chelmsford
and
Billericay
.
<EOS>
the
general
headquarters
have
be
establish
at
Danbury
,
and
,
thither
I
make
my
way
as
fast
as
my
car
could
get
along
the
road
,
block
as
they
be
by
march
horse
,
foot
,
and
artillery
.
<EOS>
I
have
spend
the
night
at
South
Hanningfield
,
so
as
to
be
on
the
spot
for
the
expect
attack
on
Wickford
;
but
as
soon
as
I
find
it
be
not
to
come
off
,
I
consider
that
at
Danbury
would
be
the
good
chance
of
find
out
what
our
next
move
be
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
"
nor
be
I
mistaken
.
<EOS>
as
I
run
up
to
the
village
I
find
the
road
full
of
troop
under
arm
,
and
everything
denote
action
of
some
kind
.
<EOS>
I
be
lucky
enough
to
come
across
a
friend
of
mine
on
the
staff
--
<EOS>
Captain
B----
,
I
will
call
him
--
who
spare
a
moment
to
give
me
the
tip
that
a
general
move
forward
be
commence
,
and
that
a
big
battle
be
imminent
.
<EOS>
Danbury
be
situate
on
the
high
ground
for
many
mile
round
,
and
as
it
bid
fair
to
be
a
fine
,
clear
day
,
I
think
I
could
not
do
better
than
try
and
get
a
general
look
round
from
the
summit
of
the
church
tower
before
proceed
farther
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
inform
that
the
General
be
up
there
with
some
of
his
staff
and
a
signal
party
,
so
that
I
could
not
ascend
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
pass
,
however
,
eventually
procure
me
admission
to
the
little
platform
,
which
,
by
the
way
,
the
General
leave
a
moment
after
my
arrival
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
eight
o'clock
,
the
sun
be
fairly
high
in
the
heavens
,
and
the
light
mist
that
hang
about
the
low
ground
in
the
vicinity
of
Maldon
be
fast
fade
into
nothingness
.
<EOS>
the
old
town
be
plainly
distinguishable
as
a
dark
silhouette
against
the
morning
light
,
<EOS>
which
,
while
it
illumine
the
panorama
spread
out
before
me
,
yet
render
observation
somewhat
difficult
,
since
it
shine
almost
directly
into
my
eye
.
<EOS>
however
,
by
the
aid
of
my
glass
I
be
able
to
see
something
of
the
first
move
on
the
fatal
chess
-
board
where
so
many
thousand
of
life
be
stake
on
the
bloody
game
of
war
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
notice
among
other
thing
that
the
lesson
of
the
recent
war
in
the
East
have
not
pass
unobserved
,
for
in
all
the
open
space
on
the
eastern
slope
of
the
hill
,
where
the
road
be
not
screen
by
tree
or
coppice
,
lofty
erection
of
hurdle
and
greenery
have
be
place
overnight
to
hide
the
preliminary
movement
of
our
troop
from
the
glass
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
under
cover
of
these
,
regiment

of

,
battery
of
artillery
and
ammunition

,
be

to
their

down
the
network
of
road
and
lane
lead
to
the
low
ground
towards
the
south
-
east
.
<EOS>
two
battalion
stand
in
quarter
column
behind
Thrift
Wood
.
<EOS>
They
be
kilte
corp
,
probably
the
Argylls
and
the
London
Scottish
.
<EOS>
several
field
battery
move
off
to
the
left
towards
Woodham
Walter
.
<EOS>
other
battalion
take
up
their
position
behind
Hyde
Woods
,
farther
away
to
the
right
,
the
last
of
them
,
the
Grenadier
Guards
,
I
fancy
,
pass
behind
them
and
march
still
farther
southward
.
 
<EOS>
"
finally
,
two
strong
battalion
,
easily
recognise
as
marine
by
their
blue
war
-
kit
,
march
rapidly
down
the
main
road
and
halt
presently
behind
Woodham
Mortimer
Place
.
<EOS>
all
this
time
there
be
neither
sight
nor
sound
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
the
bird
carol
gaily
in
the
old
elm
round
my
eyrie
,
the
sparrow
and
martin
pipe
and
twitter
in
the
eave
of
the
old
church
,
and
the
sun
shine
genially
on
hill
and
valley
,
field
and
wood
.
<EOS>
to
all
appearance
,
peace
reign
over
the
countryside
,
though
the
dun
masse
of
troop
in
the
shadow
of
the
woodland
be
suggestive
of
the
autumn
manoeuvre
.
<EOS>
but
for
all
this
the
'
Real
Thing
'
be
upon
us
.
<EOS>
as
I
look
,
first
one
,
then
another
long
and
widely
scatter
line
of
crouch
man
in
khaki
issue
from
the
cover
of
Hyde
Woods
and
begin
slowly
to
move
away
towards
the
east
.
<EOS>
then
,
and
not
till
then
,
a
vivid
violet
-
white
flash
blaze
out
on
the
dim
grey
upland
five
mile
away
to
the
south
-
east
,
which
have
be
point
out
to
me
as
Great
Canney
,
and
almost
at
once
a
spout
of
earth
and
smoke
spring
up
a
little
way
ahead
of
the
advance
British
.
<EOS>
a
dull
boom
float
up
on
the
breeze
,
but
be
drown
in
an
ear
-
splitting
crash
somewhere
close
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
feel
the
old
tower
rock
under
the
concussion
,
which
I
presently
discover
come
from
a
battery
of
at
least
six
big
4.7
gun
establish
just
outside
the
churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
be
man
by
a
party
of
bluejacket
,
who
have
bring
them
over
from
Chatham
.
<EOS>
the
movement
I
see
develop
below
me
be
the
first
step
towards
what
I
eventually
discover
be
our
main
objective
--
purleigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Could
we
succeed
in
establish
ourselves
there
,
we
should
be
beyond
effective
range
from
Maldon
,
and
should
also
take
Great
Canney
in
reverse
,
as
well
as
the
position
on
the
refuse
left
flank
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
Maldon
,
too
,
would
be
isolate
.
<EOS>
Purleigh
,
therefore
,
be
the
key
of
the
position
.
<EOS>
Our
first
move
be
in
this
direction
.
<EOS>
the
scout
be
pick
man
from
the
line
battalion
,
but
the
firing
line
be
compose
of
volunteer
and
,
in
some
case
,
Militiamen
.
<EOS>
It
be
consider
more
politic
to
reserve
the
Regulars
for
the
later
stage
of
the
attack
.
<EOS>
the
firing
from
Canney
,
and
afterwards
from
Purleigh
,
be
at
first
at
rather
too
long
a
range
to
be
effective
,
even
from
the
heavy
gun
that
be
in
use
,
and
later
on
the
heavy
long
-
range
fire
from
'
Bloody
Mary
'
and
her
sister
at
Danbury
,
and
other
heavy
gun
and
howitzer
in
the
neighbourhood
of
East
Hanningfield
,
keep
it
down
considerably
,
although
the
big
,
high
-
explosive
shell
be
now
and
again
most
terribly
destructive
to
the
advance
British
.
 
<EOS>
"
when
,
however
,
the
firing
line
--
which
as
yet
have
not
be
near
enough
to
fire
a
shot
in
reply
--
arrive
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Loddard
's
Hill
,
its
left
come
under
a
terrible
rifle
fire
from
Hazeleigh
Wood
,
while
its
right
and
centre
be
all
but
destroy
by
a
tornado
of
shrapnel
from
some
german
field
battery
to
the
north
of
Purleigh
.
<EOS>
though
dazed
and
stagger
under
the
appalling
sleet
of
projectile
,
the
volunteer
stick
doggedly
to
their
ground
,
though
unable
to

thickly

It
be
a
perfect
holocaust
.

some
other
card
must
be
play
at

when
I
send
off
my
despatch
by

last
night
,
it
be
with
very
different
feeling

those
with
which
I
take

distinctly

for

our
brave

do
all

on

agree

to
have

as
good
<EOS>
a
one
as
could
have

evolve

the

their

fight
well

there

no

of
ammunition
at

engagement

<EOS>
"
'
who
,
then
,
be
responsible
?
'
<EOS>
it
may
well
be
ask
.
<EOS>
the
answer
be
simple
.
<EOS>
the
british
public
,
which
,
in
its
apathetic
attitude
towards
military
efficiency
,
aid
and
abet
by
the
soothe
theory
of
the
extremist
of
the
'
Blue
Water
'
school
,
have
,
as
usual
,
neglect
to
provide
an
Army
fit
to
cope
in
number
and
efficiency
with
those
of
our
continental
neighbour
.
<EOS>
have
we
have
a
sufficiency
of
troop
,
more
especially
of
regular
troop
,
there
be
not
the
slight
doubt
that
the
victory
would
have
be
ours
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
our
General
be
oblige
to
attack
the
enemy
's
position
with
a
force
whose
number
,
even
if
they
have
be
all
regular
soldier
,
be
below
those
judge
necessary
by
military
expert
for
the
task
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
break
through
the
german
line
,
success
be
in
his
grasp
have
he
have
sufficient
reinforcement
to
have
establish
him
in
the
position
he
have
win
,
and
to
beat
back
the
inevitable
counter
-
attack
.
<EOS>

it
be
good
that
I
should
continue
my
account
of
the
fighting
from
the
point
at
which
I
close
my
letter
of
yesterday
.
<EOS>
I
have
arrive
at
the
checking
of
our
advance
near
Loddard
's
Hill
by
the
blast
of
shrapnel
from
the
german
field
battery
.
<EOS>
It
be
plain
that
the
Volunteer
Brigade
,
though
it
hold
its
ground
,
could
not
advance
farther
.
<EOS>
but
,
unnoticed
by
them
,
the
General
have
be
prepare
for
this
eventuality
.
 
<EOS>
"
on
the
left
the
two
battalion
of
Marines
that
I
notice
draw
up
behind
Woodham
Mortimer
Place
suddenly
debouch
on
Loddard
's
Hill
,
and
,
carry
forward
with
them
the
debris
of
the
Volunteer
firing
line
,
hurl
themselves
into
Hazeleigh
Wood

<EOS>
there
be
a
sanguinary
hand

to

on
the
wire

entangle
border
,

the
newcomer
be
not
to
be
deny

,
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
's
desperate
melee

fill
the
sylvan
glade
with
moaning
and
writhe
wound
and
stark
dead
body

we
remain
master
of
the
wood
,
and
even
obtain
a
footing
on
the
railway
line
where
it
adjoin
it

<EOS>
"
simultaneously
a
long
line
of
our
field
battery
come
into
action
near
Woodham
Mortimer

some
try
to
beat
down
the
fire
of
the
german
gun
opposite
,

other
reply
to
a
battery

have
be
establish
near
West
Maldon
Station
to
flank
the
railway

and
which
be
now
begin
to
open
on
Hazeleigh
Wood

the
latter

assist
by
a
battery
of
4.7
gun

by

take
up
a
position

Woodham
Walter

at

obscure
by
the
cloud
of
smoke

explosive
projectile

up

distinct
move
forward

the
defence
be

stubborn

about
midday
the
whole
line
again
come
to
a

here
we

the
main
attack

on

the
north
the
Colchester
Garrison
again
bring
their
heavy
artillery
into
action
on
the
slope
south
of
Wickham
Bishops

of

a

merely
intend

keep

on
the
right
a
rather
important
flank
movement
be
in
progress

<EOS>
"
We
have
a
considerable
body
of
troop
at
East
Hanningfield

which
lie
in
a
hollow
between
two
little
ridge
,
both
run
from
south

west

east

about
a
mile
apart

<EOS>
the
most
easterly
ridge
be
very
narrow
for
the
most
part
,
and
behind
it
be
station
several
battery
of
our
field
howitzer
,
which
fire
over
it
at
Great
Canney
at
a
range
of
about
5,000
yard

a
number
of
4.7-inch
gun
,
scatter
over
the
western
hill

be
also
concentrate
on
the
same
target
.
<EOS>
although
the
range
be
an
extremely
long
one
,
there
be
no
doubt
that
they
make
a
certain
number
of
effective
hit
,
since
Great
Canney
offer
a
conspicuous
and
considerable
target
.
<EOS>
but
beyond
this
the
flash
of
their
discharge
draw
off
all
attention
from
the
howitzer
battery
in

of
them
,

serve
to
conceal
their

would
have

"
the

a
long

wearisome
march
before

take
advantage
of
the
time

low
tide

to
move
along

the
sound
of
artillery

I

out
into

one
after
another
break
into
a
mad
gallop

they
bear
down
upon
the
advance

our
citizen

staunchly
as
these
have
withstand
the
murderous
fire

for

the
thunder
of
thousand
of
hoofs

the
hoarse
cry

rather
more
than
such
partially
train
soldier
could
stand

scattering
discharge

by
something
very
much
approach

a
large
number
of
volunteer
,
however
,
seek
shelter
among
the
ruined
house
of
Cock
Clarke
's
hamlet

from
whence
they
open
a
heavy
fire
on
the
adventurous
horseman

Argyll

at

the
news

capture

two
kopjes

me

I
make
for
Danbury

write
my
despatch

<EOS>
"
shortly
after
my
arrival
I
hear
of
the
capture
of
Spar
Hill

a
detached
knoll
about
1,200
yard
to
the
north

west
of
Purleigh

the

assault
it

wonder

I
report
satisfactory
progress

reckon
--
too
confidently

on
a

"
I
spend
a
great
part
of
that
night
under
the
star
on
the
hilltop
near
East
Hanningfield

watch
the
weird
play
of
the
searchlight
which
sweep
over
the
country
from
a
score
of
different
position

and
listen
to
the
crash
of
artillery

clatter
of
rifle
fire

now
and
again
tell
of
some
attempt
movement
under

the
darkness

just
before
daylight
the
continuous
roar
of
battle
begin
again

when
light
dawn
I
find
that
our
troop
have
cut
right
through
the
german
line

have
penetrate
as
far

Cop
Kitchen

up

an
attack

towards
the
rear

heavily
bombard
by
some
of

have
be
mount
during
the
night
on
the
two
kopjes

the
reinforcement
be
not
enough

<EOS>
the
Germans
hold
fast
to
Purleigh

to
some
reserve
position

have
establish
about
Mundon

two

three
hour
of
desperate
effort

cost
the
life

critical

from
Maldon

outnumbered

almost
surround

our
gallant
warrior
have
to
give
ground

they
fall
back
as
doggedly
as
they
have
advance

the
Argylls

Marines

cover
the
retreat
on
Danbury

<EOS>
"
the
gun
at
East
Hanningfield
and
the
two
kopjes
check
the
pursuit
to
a
great
extent

the
Germans
seem
unwilling
to
go
far
from
their

<EOS>
the

practically
suspend
,
owe
to
the
damage
do
to
the
various
line
south
of
London
by
the
enemy

<EOS>
several
of
these
man

and
,
be
in
plain
clothe
,
be
promptly
shoot
out
of

<EOS>
however
,
their
work
have
,
unfortunately
for
us
,
be
accomplish
,
and
train
could
only
run
as
far
as
the

so

that

,
regiment
who

<EOS>
the

case
station
at
considerable
distance
,
and
although
they
have
receive
order
to

,
be
prevent
from

owe
to
the
universal
interruption

<EOS>
by
this
,
whole
valuable
day
be
lose
--
day
when
at
any
hour
the
invader
may
make
a
sudden
swoop
on
London
.
 
<EOS>
report
be
alarm
and
conflicting
.
<EOS>
some
say
that
the
enemy
mean
to
strike
a
blow
upon
the
capital
just
as
suddenly
as
they
have
land
,
while
other
reassure
the
alarmist
that
the
german
plan
be
not
yet
complete
,
and
that
they
have
not
sufficient
store
to
pursue
the
campaign
.
 
<EOS>
Reservists
,
with
starvation
stare
them
in
the
face
,
go
eagerly
south
to
join
their
regiment
,
know
that
at
least
they
would
be
feed
with
regularity
;
while
,
in
addition
,
the
true
patriotic
spirit
of
the
Englishman
have
be
rouse
against
the
aggressive
Teuton
,
and
everyone
,
officer
and
man
,
be
eager
to
bear
his
part
in
drive
the
invader
into
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
the
public
be
hold
breathless

<EOS>
what
would
happen
?
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
the

an
effective

,
with
any
hope
of
success
,
be
make
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
that
the
german
tactic

swift

rapid
blow
at
London

They

<EOS>
the

field
artillery
of
both
division

together
with
the
divisional
troop
,
be
compel
to
set
out
by
march
-
route
from
Aldershot
for
the
line
of
defence
.
<EOS>
the
single
and
all
-
sufficient
reason
of
this
delay
in
send
out
the
cavalry
and
artillery
be
owe
to
the
totally
inadequate
accommodation
on
the
railway
for
the
transport
of
so
many
horse
and
gun
.
<EOS>
the
troop
-
train
,
which
be
of
course
,
necessary
to
transport
the
infantry
,
be
not
forthcoming
in
sufficient
number
,
this
owe
to
the
fact
that
at
several
point
the
line
to
London
be
still
interrupt
.
 
<EOS>
the
order
to
the
cavalry
who
go
by

be
to
get
up

propose
to
be
take

,
and
to
operate
in
front
of
it
to
the
east
and
north
-
east
in
screening
and
reconnoitring
duty
.
<EOS>
the
temporary
deficiency
of
cavalry
,
who
ought
,
of
course
,
to
have
be
the
first
to
arrive
at
the
scene
,
be
make
good
as
far
as
possible
by
the
general
employment
of
horde
of
motor

cyclist
,
who
scour
the
country
in
large
armed
group
,
in
order
to
ascertain
,
if
possible
,
the

<EOS>
this
they
do
,
and
very

after
their
arrival

the
result
of
their
investigation
to
the
general
officer
command
the
1st

meanwhile

<EOS>
roughly
,
the
distance
be
over
fifty
mile

therefore
those

be
compel
to
halt
the
night
on
the
way
,
while
those
in
the

get
through
to

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
in

<EOS>
no

however
,
than
battalion
begin

while
troop
from

which

roughly
speak
,
extend
through

,
to
Saffron
Walden
,
across
to
Braintree
,
and
also
the
high
ground
command
the
valley
of
the
Colne
to
Colchester
.
 
<EOS>
the
line
choose
by
the
General
Staff
be
the
natural
chain
of
hill
which
present
the
first
obstacle
to
the
enemy
advance
on
London
from
the
wide
plain
stretching
eastward
beyond
Cambridge
to
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
if
this
could
be
hold
strongly
,
as
be
intend
,
by
practically
the
whole
of
the
british
force
locate
in
the
South
of
England
,
include
the
Yeomanry
,
Militia
,
and
Volunteers
--
who
be
now
all
mass
in
every
direction
--
then
the
deadly
peril
threaten
England
may
be
avert
.
 
<EOS>
but
could
it
be
hold
?
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
appalling
question
on
every
one
's
tongue
all
over
the
country
,
for
it
now
become
generally
know
that
upon
this
line
of
defence
four
complete
and
perfectly
equip
german
army
corp
be
ready
to
advance
at
any
moment
,
in
addition
to
the
right
flank
be
expose
to
the
attack
of
the
XIIth
Saxon
Corps
,
entrench
on
the
Essex
coast
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
estimate
that
no
few
than
two
hundred
thousand
Germans
be
already
upon
english
soil
!
 
<EOS>
the
outlook
grow
blacker
every
hour
.
 
<EOS>
London
be
in
a
state
of
absolute
stagnation
and
chaos
.
<EOS>
in
the
City
,
business
be
now
at
an
entire
standstill
.
<EOS>
the
credit
system
have
receive
a
fatal
blow
,
and
nobody
want
to
buy
security
.
<EOS>
have
people
keep
level
head
in
the
crisis
there
would
have
be
a
moratorium
,
but
,
as
it
be
,
a
panic
have
be
create
that
nothing
could
allay
.
<EOS>
even
Consols
be
now
unsaleable
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
small
bank
be
know
to
have
fail
,
and
trader
and
manufacturer
all
over
the
country
have
be
ruin
on
account
of
credit
,
the
foundation
of
all
trade
,
have
be
sweep
away
.
<EOS>
only
person
of
the
high
financial
standing
could
have
deal
with
the
bank
,
even
if
they
have
remain
open
.
 
<EOS>
the
opinion
hold
in
banking
circle
be
that
if
the
invasion
should
unfortunately
prove
disastrous
to
England
,
and
Germany
demand
a
huge
indemnity
,
there
be
still
hope
,
however
small
.
<EOS>
the
experience
of
the
Franco
-
german
war
have
prove
that
,
though
in
such
circumstance
the
Bank
,
for
a
considerable
period
,
may
not
be
able
to
resume
cash
payment
,
yet
,
with
sound
finance
,
there
be
no
reason
that
the
currency
should
greatly
depreciate
.
<EOS>
during
the
period
of
suspension
of
cash
payment
by
the
Bank
of
France
,
the
premium
on
gold
never
go
above
1.5
per
cent
.
,
and
during
most
of
the
period
be
5
,
4
,
or
even
less
per
mille
.
<EOS>
therefore
what
the
French
by
sound
banking
have
be
able
to
do
,
there
be
no
reason
why
english
banker
could
not
also
do
.

victory
at

.
<EOS>
a
victory
due
not
only
to
the
bravery
and
exertion
of
our
troop
,
regular
and
auxiliary
,
but
also
to
the
genius
of
Field

Marshal
Lord

our

Corps

out
that
part

him

<EOS>
"
but
though
in
this
success
we
may
hope
that
we
be
see
the
first
glimmering
of
dawn
--
of
deliverance
from
the
nightmare
of
german
invasion
that
be
now
oppress
our
dear
old
England
<EOS>
--
we
must
not
be
lead
into
foolishly
sanguine
hope
.
<EOS>
the
snake
have
be
scotch
,
and
pretty
badly
into
the
bargain
,
but
he
be
far
from

<EOS>
the
german
IVth
Army
Corps

under
the
famous
General
Von
Kleppen
,
their
magnificent
Garde
Corps
command
by
the
Duke

Froelich
's
fine
Cavalry
Division

have
be
repulse
in
their
attack
on
our
position
near
Royston
and
Saffron
Walden
,
and
drive
back
with
great
loss
and
confusion
.
<EOS>
but
we
be
too
weak
to
follow
up
our
victory
as
it
should
be
follow
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
menace
of
the
IXth
and
Xth
Corps
on
our
right
flank
tie
us
to
our
select
position
,
and
the
bulk
of
our
force
be
compose
of
indifferently
train
Volunteers
and
Militia
,
be
much
more
formidable
behind
entrenchment
than
when
attempt
to
manoeuvre
in
a
difficult
and
intricate
country
such
as
it
be
about
here
.
<EOS>
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
we
have
give
pause
to
the
invader
,
and
have
certainly
gain
a
few
day
'
time
,
which
will
be
invaluable
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
able
to
get
on
with
the
line
of
fortification
that
be
be
construct
to
bar
the
approach
to
London
,
and
behind
which
it
will
be
necessary
for
us
to
make
our
final
stand
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
conceive
that
it
be
possible
for
such
an
agglomeration
of
amateur
troop
as
our
be
in
the
main
to
defeat
in
the
open
field
such
formidable
and
well
-
train
force
as
the
Germans
have
succeed
in
throw
into
this
country
.
<EOS>
but
when
our
Navy
have
regain
command
of
the
sea
,
we
hope
that
we
may
,
before
very
long
,
place
our
unwelcome
visitor
'
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
sea'--the
part
of
the
devil
be
play
by
our
brave
troop
finally
concentrate
behind
the
strong
defence
of
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
that
the
Germans
may
run
out
of
ammunition
and
provision
.
<EOS>
for
if
communication
with
the
Fatherland
be
effectively
cut
,
they
must
starve
,
unless
they
have
previously
compel
our
submission
;
for
it
be
impossible
for
an
army
of
the
size
that
have
invade
us
to
live
on
the
country

no

starve

battle

know
that
the
great
portion

<EOS>
the
Garde
Cavalry
Brigade
be
report
to
be
well
away
to
the
westward
towards
Kettering

obtain
early
knowledge
of
the
intention
of
the
Germans
to
make
an
attack
on
our
position
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
they
talk
openly
of
it
,
and
state
at
Cambridge
and
Newmarket
that
they
would
not
manoeuvre
at
all
,
and
only
hope
that
we
should
hold
on
long
enough
to
our
position
to
enable
them
to
smash
up
our
IInd
and
IIIrd
Corps
by
a
frontal
attack
,
and
so
clear
the
road
to
London
.
<EOS>
the
main
road
lend
themselves
admirably
to
such
strategy
,
which
render
the
report
of
their
intention
the
more
probable
,

they
all
converge
on
our

main
point
of
concentration

"
I
sit
down
,
after
a
sleepless
night
,
to
indite
the
account
of
our
late
move
.
<EOS>
We
hear
that
Sheffield
have
fall
,
and
our
troop
be
in
flight
.
<EOS>
as
,
by
the
time
this
appear
in
print
,
the
enemy
will
of
necessity
be
aware
of
our
abandonment
of
Colchester
,
the
censor
will
not
,
I
imagine
,
prevent
the
despatch
of
my
letter
.
 
<EOS>
"
for
our
move
have
be
make
one
of
a
retrograde
nature
,
and
I
do
not
doubt
that
the
cavalry
of
the
german
IXth
Corps
be
close
behind
us
and
in
touch
with
our
own
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
not
,
in
use
the
word
'
retrograde
,
'
be
suppose
to
criticise
in
any
way
the
strategy
of
our
general
.
<EOS>
for
every
one
here
be
,
I
be
sure
,
fully
persuade
of
the
wisdom
of
the
step
.
<EOS>
Colchester
,
with
its
plucky
little
garrison
,
be
altogether
too
much
'
in
the
air
,
'
and
stand
a
great
risk
of
be
isolate
by
a
converging
advance
of
the
IXth
and
Xth
Corps
of
the
german
invader
,
to
say
nothing
of
the
XIIth
(
Saxon
)
Corps
at
Maldon
,
which
since
the
unfortunate
battle
of
Purleigh
have
show
itself
very
active
to
the
north
and
east
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
saxon
have
refrain
from
attack
our
Vth
Corps
since
its
repulse
,
and
it
have
be
leave
almost
in
peace
to
entrench
its
position
from
Danbury
to
the
southward
;
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
while
not
neglect
to
further
strengthen
their
already
formidable
defence
between
the
Blackwater
and
the
Crouch
,
their
cavalry
have
scour
the
country
up
to
the
very
gate
of
Colchester
.
<EOS>
yesterday
morning
the
16th
Lancers
and
the
17th
Hussars
--
who
have
fall
back
from
Norwich
--
together
with
some
of
the
local
Yeomanry
,
move
out
by
the
Tolleshunt
d'arcy
and
Great
Totham
road
,
and
drive
in
their
patrol
with
some
loss
.
<EOS>
at
Tiptree
Heath
there
be
a
sharp
cavalry
engagement
between
our
red
Lancers
and
several
squadron
of
a
sky
-
blue
hussar
regiment
.
<EOS>
Our
people
route
them
,
but
in
the
pursuit
that
follow
would
have
fare
badly
,
as
they
fall
in
with
the
four
remaining
squadron
support
by
another
complete
regiment
,
have
it
not
be
for
the
opportune
arrival
of
the
Household
Cavalry
Brigade
,
which
have
move
north
-
east
from
Danbury
to
co
-
operate
.
<EOS>
this
completely
change
the
aspect
of
affair
.
<EOS>
the
Germans
be
soundly
beat
,
with
the
loss
of
a
large
number
of
prisoner
,
and
gallop
back
to
Maldon
in
confusion
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
the
2nd
King
's
Own
Royal
Lancaster
Regiment
and
the
5th
Battery
R.F.
Artillery
have
be
send
down
to
Witham
by
train
,
whence
they
march
up
to
the
high
ground
near
Wickham
Bishops
.
<EOS>
They
and
the
Yeomanry
be
leave
there
in
a
position
to
cover
the
main
London
Road
and
the
Great
Eastern
Railway
,
and
at
the
same
time
threaten
any
movement
of
the
enemy
by
the
Great
Totham
Road
.
<EOS>
when
the
news
of
our
success
reach
Colchester
,
soon
after
midday
,
we
be
all
very
jubilant
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
I
fear
that
a
great
many
people
spend
the
afternoon
in
a
species
of
fool
's
paradise
.
<EOS>
and
when
towards
the
evening
the
announcement
of
our
splendid
victory
at
Royston
be
post
up
on
the
red
wall
of
the
fine
town
hall
,
and
outside
the
Cups
,
there
be
an
incipient
outbreak
of
that
un
-
English
excitement
know
as
'
mafficke
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
but
this
exultation
be
fate
to
be
but
short
-
live
,
even
though
the
Mayor
appear
on
the
balcony
of
the
Town
Hall
and
address
the
crowd
,
while
the
late
news
be
post
outside
the
office
of
the
'
Essex
Telegraph
,
'
opposite
the
post
office
.
<EOS>
the
wind
be
in
the
north
,
and
about
5.45
in
the
afternoon
the
sound
of
a
heavy
explosion
be
hear
from
the
direction
of
Manningtree
.
<EOS>
I
be
in
the
Cups
Hotel
at
the
time
arrange
for
an
early
dinner
,
and
run
out
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
as
I
emerge
from
the
archway
of
the
hotel
I
distinctly
hear
a
second
detonation
from
the
same
direction
.
<EOS>
a
sudden
silence
,
ominous
and
unnatural
,
seem
to
fall
on
the
yelping
jingo
in
the
street
,
in
the
midst
of
which
the
rumble
of
yet
another
explosion
roll
down
on
the
wind
,
this
time
from
a
more
westerly
direction
.
<EOS>
man
ask
their
neighbour
breathlessly
as
to
what
all
this
portend
.
<EOS>
I
myself
know
no
more
than
the
most
ignorant
of
the
crowd
,
till
in
an
officer
who
rush
hastily
by
me
in
Head
Street
,
on
his
way
into
the
hotel
,
I
recognise
my
friend
Captain
Burton
,
of
the
Artillery
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
buttonhole
him
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
do
I
know
what
those
explosion
be
?
'
repeat
he
in
answer
to
my
inquiry
.
'
<EOS>
well
,
I
do
not
know
,
but
I
be
open
to
bet
you
five
to
one
that
it
be
the
sapper
blow
up
the
bridge
over
the
Stour
at
Manningtree
and
Stratford
St.
Mary
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
'
then
the
Germans
will
have
arrive
there
?
'
<EOS>
I
query
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
most
probably
.
<EOS>
and
look
here
,
'
he
continue
,
take
me
aside
by
the
arm
,
and
lower
his
voice
,
'
you
take
my
tip
.
<EOS>
We
shall
be
out
of
this
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
so
you
would
best
pack
up
your
trap
and
get
into
marching
order
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
'
do
you
know
this
?
'
<EOS>
say
I.
 
"
'
not
officially
,
or
<EOS>
I
should
not
tell
you
anything
about
it
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
put
two
and
two
together
.
<EOS>
We
all
know
that
the
General
would
not
be
fool
enough
to
try
and
defend
an
open
town
of
this
size
with
such
a
small
garrison
against
a
whole
army
corps
,
or
perhaps
more
.
<EOS>
It
would
serve
no
good
purpose
,
and
expose
the
place
to
destruction
and
bring
all
sort
of
disaster
on
the
civil
population
.
<EOS>
You
could
have
see
that
for
yourself
,
for
no
attempt
whatever
have
be
make
to
erect
defence
of
any
kind
,
neither
have
we
receive
any
reinforcement
at
all
.
<EOS>
if
they
have
mean
to
defend
it
they
could
certainly
have
contrive
to
send
us
some
volunteer
and
gun
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
no
,
the
few
troop
we
have
here
have
do
their
good
in
assist
the
Danbury
Force
against
the
Saxons
,
and
be
much
too
valuable
to
be
leave
here
to
be
cut
off
without
be
able
to
do
much
to
check
the
advance
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
if
we
have
be
go
to
try
anything
of
that
kind
,
we
should
have
now
be
hold
the
line
of
the
river
Stour
;
but
I
know
we
have
only
small
detachment
at
the
various
bridge
,
sufficient
only
to
drive
off
the
enemy
's
cavalry
patrol
.
<EOS>
by
now
,
have
blow
up
the
bridge
,
I
expect
they
be
fall
back
as
fast
as
they
can
get
.
<EOS>
besides
,
look
here
,
'
he
add
,
'
what
do
you
think
that
battalion
be
send
to
Wickham
Bishops
for
this
morning
?
'
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
him
my
theory
as
set
forth
above
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
oh
,
yes
,
that
be
all
right
,
'
he
answer
.
'
<EOS>
but
you
may
bet
your
boot
that
there
be
more
in
it
than
that
.
<EOS>
in
my
opinion
,
the
General
have
have
order
to
clear
out
as
soon
as
the
enemy
be
prepare
to
cross
the
Stour
,
and
the
lancaster
be
plant
there
to
protect
our
left
flank
from
an
attack
from
Maldon
while
we
be
retreat
on
Chelmsford
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
'
but
we
may
fall
back
on
Braintree
?
'
<EOS>
I
hazard
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
do
not
you
believe
it
.
<EOS>
We
be
not
want
there
--
at
least
,
I
mean
,
not
so
much
as
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
where
we
shall
come
in
be
to
help
to
fill
the
gap
between
Braintree
and
Danbury
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
myself
,
we
may
just
as
well
have
do
it
before
.
<EOS>
We
have
be
send
back
store
by
rail
for
the
last
two
day
.
<EOS>
well
,
good
-
bye
,
'
he
say
,
hold
out
his
hand
.
'
<EOS>
keep
all
this
to
yourself
,
and
mark
my
word
,
we
will
be
off
at
dusk
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
away
he
go
,
and
convince
that
his
prognostication
be
correct
--
as
,
indeed
,
in
the
main
they
prove
--
I
hasten
to
eat
my
dinner
,
pay
my
bill
,
and
get
my
portmanteau
pack
and
stow
away
in
my
motor
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
evening
begin
to
close
in
I
start
and
make
for
the
barrack
,
go
easy
.
<EOS>
the
street
be
still
full
of
people
,
but
they
be
very
quiet
,
and
mostly
talk
together
in
scatter
group
.
<EOS>
a
shadow
seem
to
have
fall
on
the
jubilant
crowd
of
the
afternoon
,
though
,
as
far
as
I
could
ascertain
,
there
be
no
definite
rumour
of
the
departure
of
the
troop
and
the
close
advent
of
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
"
when
I
arrive
at
the
barrack
,
I
see
at
once
that
there
be
something
in
the
wind
,
and
pull
up
alongside
the
barrack
railing
,
determine
to
watch
the
progress
of
event
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
long
to
wait
.
<EOS>
in
about
ten
minute
a
bugle
sound
,
and
the
scatter
assemblage
of
man
on
the
barrack
-
square
close
together
and
solidify
into
a
series
of
quarter
column
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
the
Volunteer
battalion
move
across
from
the
other
side
of
the
road
and
join
the
regular
troop
.
<EOS>
I
hear
a
sharp
clatter
and
jingling
behind
me
,
and
,
look
round
,
see
the
General
and
his
staff
with
a
squad
of
cavalry
canter
up
the
road
.
<EOS>
They
turn
into
the
barrack
gate
,
greet
by
a
sharp
word
of
command
and
the
rattle
of
arm
from
the
assemble
battalion
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
I
could
make
out
,
the
General
make
them
some
kind
of
address
,
after
which
I
hear
another
word
of
command
,
upon
which
the
regiment
near
to
the
gate
form
four
and
march
out
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
2nd
dorsetshire
.
<EOS>
I
watch
anxiously
to
see
which
way
they
turn
.
<EOS>
as
I
more
than
expect
,
they
turn
in
the
direction
of
the
London
Road
.
<EOS>
My
friend
have
be
right
so
far
,
but
till
the
troop
arrive
at
Mark
's
Tey
,
where
the
road
fork
,
I
could
not
be
certain
whether
they
be
go
towards
Braintree
or
Chelmsford
.
<EOS>
the
Volunteers
follow
;
then
the
Leicestershires
,
then
a
long
train
of
artillery
,
field
battery
,
big
4.7
gun
,
and
howitzer
.
<EOS>
the
King
's
own
Scottish
Borderers
form
the
rearguard
.
<EOS>
with
them
march
the
General
and
his
staff
;
I
see
no
cavalry
.
<EOS>
I
discover
afterwards
that
the
General
,
foresee
that
a
retirement
be
imminent
,
have
order
the
16th
Lancers
and
the
7th
Hussars
,
after
their
successful
morning
performance
,
to
remain
till
further
order
at
Kelvedon
and
Tiptree
respectively
,
so
that
their
horse
be
rest
during
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
"
during
the
night
march
the
former
come
back
and
form
a
screen
behind
the
retire
column
,
while
the
latter
be
in
a
position
to
observe
and
check
any
movement
northward
that
may
be
make
by
the
Saxons
,
at
the
same
time
protect
its
flank
and
rear
from
a
possible
advance
by
the
cavalry
of
Von
Kronhelm
's
Army
,
should
they
succeed
in
cross
the
river
Stour
soon
enough
to
be
able
to
press
after
us
in
pursuit
by
either
of
the
two
eastern
road
lead
from
Colchester
to
Maldon
.
<EOS>
after
the
last
of
the
depart
soldier
have
tramp
away
into
the
gathering
darkness
through
the
mud
,
which
after
yesterday
's
downpour
still
lie
thick
upon
the
road
,
I
bethink
me
that
I
may
as
well
run
down
to
the
railway
station
to
see
if
anything
be
go
on
there
.
<EOS>
I
be
just
in
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
electric
light
disclose
a
bustling
scene
as
the
last
of
the
ammunition
and
a
certain
proportion
of
store
be
be
hurry
into
a
long
train
that
stand
with
steam
up
ready
to
be
off
.
<EOS>
the
police
allow
none
of
the
general
public
to
enter
the
station
,
but
my
correspondent
's
pass
obtain
me
admission
to
the
departure
platform
.
<EOS>
there
I
see
several
detachment
of
the
Royal
Engineers
,
the
Mounted
Infantry
--
minus
their
horse
,
which
have
be
already
send
on
--
and
some
of
the
Leicestershire
Regiment
.
<EOS>
many
of
the
man
have
their
arm
,
leg
,
or
head
bandage
,
and
bear
evident
trace
of
have
be
in
action
.
<EOS>
I
get
into
conversation
with
a
colour
-
sergeant
of
the
Engineers
,
and
learn
these
be
the
detachment
who
have
be
station
at
the
bridge
over
the
Stour
.
<EOS>
It
appear
there
be
some
sharp
skirmishing
with
the
german
advance
troop
before
the
officer
in
command
have
decide
that
they
be
in
sufficient
force
to
justify
them
in
blow
up
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
at
the
one
at
which
my
informant
be
station
,
and
that
the
most
important
one
of
all
,
over
which
the
main
road
from
Ipswich
pass
at
Stratford
St.
Mary
,
the
officer
in
charge
delay
just
too
long
,
so
that
a
party
of
the
enemy
's
cavalry
actually
secure
the
bridge
,
and
succeed
in
cut
the
wire
lead
to
the
charge
which
have
be
place
in
readiness
to
blow
it
up
.
<EOS>
luckily
,
the
various
detachment
present
rise
like
one
man
to
the
occasion
,
and
,
despite
a
heavy
fire
,
hurl
themselves
upon
the
intruder
with
the
bayonet
with
such
determination
and
impetus
,
that
the
bridge
be
sweep
clear
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
the
wire
be
reconnecte
,
and
the
bridge
clear
of
our
man
just
as
the
Germans
,
reinforce
by
several
of
their
support
squadron
,
who
have
come
up
at
a
gallop
,
dash
upon
it
in
pursuit
.
<EOS>
the
firing
key
be
press
at
this
critical
moment
,
and
,
with
a
stunning
report
,
a
whole
troop
be
blow
into
the
air
,
the
remain
horse
,
mad
with
fright
,
stampede
despite
all
that
their
rider
could
do
.
<EOS>
the
road
be
cut
,
and
the
german
advance
temporarily
check
,
while
the
british
detachment
make
off
as
fast
as
it
could
for
Colchester
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ask
the
sergeant
how
long
he
think
it
would
be
before
the
Germans
succeed
in
cross
it
.
'
<EOS>
bless
you
,
<EOS>
sir
,
I
expect
they
be
over
by
now
,
'
he
answer
.
'
They
would
be
sure
to
have
their
bridge
company
somewhere
close
up
,
and
it
would
not
take
them
more
than
an
hour
or
two
to
throw
a
bridge
over
that
place
.
'
<EOS>
the
bridge
at
Boxted
Mill
and
Nayland
have
be
destroy
previously
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
railway
bridge
and
the
other
one
at
Manningtree
be
blow
up
before
the
Germans
could
get
a
footing
,
and
their
defender
have
come
in
by
rail
.
<EOS>
but
my
conversation
be
cut
short
,
the
whistle
sound
,
the
man
be
hustle
on
board
the
train
,
and
it
move
slowly
out
of
the
station
.
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
I
hurry
out
to
my
car
,
and
,
put
on
speed
,
be
soon
clear
of
the
town
,
and
spin
along
for
Mark
's
Tey
.
<EOS>
It
be
about
five
mile
,
and
shortly
before
I
get
there
I
overtook
the
marching
column
.
<EOS>
the
man
be
halt
,
and
in
the
act
of
put
on
their
greatcoat
.
<EOS>
I
be
stop
here
by
the
rearguard
,
who
take
charge
of
me
,
and
would
not
let
me
proceed
until
permission
be
obtain
from
the
General
.
 
<EOS>
"
eventually
this
officer
order
me
to
be
bring
to
him
<EOS>
,
I
present
my
pass
;
but
he
say
,
'
I
be
afraid
that
I
shall
have
to
ask
you
either
to
turn
back
or
to
slow
down
and
keep
pace
with
us
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
you
have
better
do
the
latter
.
<EOS>
I
may
,
indeed
,
have
to
exercise
my
power
and
impress
your
motor
,
should
the
exigency
of
the
Service
require
it
.
'
<EOS>
I
see
that
it
be
good
to
make
virtue
of
necessity
,
and
reply
that
it
be
very
much
at
his
service
,
and
that
I
be
very
well
content
to
accompany
the
column
.
<EOS>
in
point
of
fact
,
the
latter
be
strictly
true
,
for
I
want
to
see
what
be
to
be
see
,
and
there
be
no
point
about
go
along
with
no
definite
idea
of
where
I
want
to
get
to
,
with
a
possible
chance
of
fall
into
the
hand
of
the
Saxons
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
so
a
staff
officer
,
who
be
suffer
from
a
slight
wound
,
be
place
alongside
me
,
and
the
column
,
have
muffle
itself
in
its
greatcoat
,
once
more
begin
to
plug
along
through
the
thickening
mire
.
<EOS>
My
position
be
just
in
front
of
the
gun
,
which
keep
up
a
monotonous
rumble
behind
me
.
<EOS>
My
companion
be
talkative
,
and
afford
me
a
good
deal
of
incidental
and
welcome
information
.
<EOS>
thus
,
just
after
we
start
,
and
be
turn
to
the
left
at
Mark
's
Tey
,
a
bright
glare
follow
by
a
loudish
report
come
from
the
right
of
the
road
.
'
<EOS>
what
be
that
?
'
<EOS>
I
naturally
ejaculate
.
'
<EOS>
oh
,
that
will
be
the
sapper
destroy
the
junction
with
the
Sudbury
line
,
'
he
reply
.
'
<EOS>
there
be
the
train
wait
for
them
just
beyond
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
so
it
be
.
<EOS>
the
train
that
I
have
see
leave
have
evidently
stop
after
pass
the
junction
,
while
the
line
be
break
behind
it
.
'
<EOS>
They
will
do
the
same
after
pass
the
cross
line
at
Witham
,
'
volunteer
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
mile
or
two
further
on
we
pass
between
two
line
of
horseman
,
their
face
set
northward
and
muffle
to
the
eye
in
their
long
cloak
.
'
<EOS>
that
be
some
of
the
16th
,
'
he
say
,
'
go
to
cover
our
rear
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
so
we
move
on
all
night
through
the
darkness
and
rain
,
and
with
the
first
glimmer
of
dawn
halt
at
Witham
.
<EOS>
We
have
about
nine
mile
still
to
go
to
reach
Chelmsford
,
which
I
learn
be
our
immediate
destination
,
and
it
be
decide
to
rest
here
for
an
hour
,
while
the
man
make
the
good
breakfast
they
could
from
the
content
of
their
haversack
.
<EOS>
but
the
villager
bring
out
hot
tea
and
coffee
,
and
do
the
good
they
could
for
us
,
so
we
do
not
fare
so
badly
after
all
.
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
I
get
permission
to
go
on
,
take
with
me
my
friend
the
staff
officer
,
who
have
despatch
to
forward
from
Chelmsford
.
<EOS>
I
push
on
at
full
speed
.
<EOS>
We
be
there
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
,
and
during
the
morning
I
learn
that
the
Braintree
Army
be
fall
back
on
Dunmow
,
and
that
the
Colchester
garrison
be
to
assist
in

CHAPTER

<EOS>
FIERCE
fighting
at
CHELMSFORD
.
  
<EOS>
a
despatch
from
Mr.
Edgar
Hamilton
to
the
"
Daily
News
,
"
as
follow
,
be
publish
on
Saturday
,
15th
September
:
 
<EOS>
"
at
Little
Waltham
I
find
myself
close
to
the
scene
of
action
.
<EOS>
about
a
mile
ahead
of
me
the
hamlet
of
Howe
Street
be
in
flame
and
burn
furiously
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
the
shell
burst
in
and
all
over
it
in
perfect
covey
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
make
out
where
they
be
come
from
,
but
an
officer
I
meet
say
he
think
the
enemy
must
have
several
battery
in
action
on
the
high
ground
about
Littley
Green
,
a
mile
and
a
half
to
the
north
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
I
cross
over
myself
,
and
get
up
on
the
knoll
where
the
Leicestershires
and
Dorsets
have
be
station
,
together
with
a
number
of
the
4.7-inch
gun
bring
from
Colchester
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
piece
of
elevated
ground
be
about
two
mile
long
,
run
almost
north
and
south
,
and
at
the
top
of
it
I
get
an
extensive
view
to
the
eastward
right
away
to
beyond
Witham
,
as
the
ground
fall
all
the
way
.
<EOS>
the
country
be
well
wooded
,
and
a
perfect
maze
of
tree
and
hedgerow
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
any
Germans
down
there
in
this
plain
they
be
lie
very
low
indeed
,
for
my
glass
do
not
discover
the
least
indication
of
their
presence
.
<EOS>
due
east
my
view
be
bound
by
the
high
woode
ground
about
Wickham
Bishops
and
Tiptree
Heath
,
which
lie
a
long
blue
hummock
on
the
horizon
,
while
to
the
south
-
east
Danbury
Hill
,
with
our
big
war
-
balloon
float
overhead
,
be
plainly
discernible
.
 
<EOS>
"
while
I
gaze
on
the
apparently
peaceful
landscape
I
be
startle
by
a
nasty
,
sharp
hissing
sound
,
which
come
momentarily
near
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
pass
over
my
head
,
and
be
follow
by
a
loud
bang
in
the
air
,
where
now
hang
a
ring
of
white
smoke
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
shell
from
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
just
ahead
of
me
be
a
somewhat
extensive
wood
;
and
,
urge
by
some
insane
impulse
of
seek
shelter
<EOS>
,
I
leave
the
car
,
which
I
order
my
chauffeur
to
take
back
for
a
mile
and
wait
,
and
make
for
the
close
-
stand
tree
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
stop
to
think
I
should
have
realise
that
the
wood
give
me
actually
no
protection
whatever
,
and
I
have
not
go
far
when
the
crashing
of
timber
and
noise
of
the
burst
projectile
overhead
and
in
the
undergrowth
around
make
me
understand
clearly
that
the
Germans
be
make
a
special
target
of
the
wood
,
which
,
I
imagine
,
they
think
may
conceal
some
of
our
troop
.
<EOS>
I
wish
heartily
that
I
be
seat
beside
my
chauffeur
in
his
fast
-
recede
car
.
 
<EOS>
"
however
,
my
first
object
be
to
get
clear
of
the
wood
again
,
and
after
some
little
time
I
emerge
on
the
west
side
,
right
in
the
middle
of
a
dress
station
for
the
wound
,
which
have
be
establish
in
a
little
hollow
.
<EOS>
two
surgeon
,
with
their
assistant
,
be
already
busily
engage
with
a
number
of
wound
man
,
most
of
whom
be
badly
hit
by
shrapnel
bullet
about
the
upper
part
of
the
body
.
<EOS>
I
gather
from
one
or
two
of
the
few
most
slightly
wound
man
that
our
people
have
be
,
and
be
,
very
hardly
put
to
it
to
hold
their
own
.
'
<EOS>
I
reckon
,
'
say
one
of
them
,
a
bombardier
of
artillery
,
'
that
the
enemy
must
have
get
more
than
a
hundred
gun
fire
at
us
,
and
at
Howe
Street
village
.
<EOS>
if
we
could
only
make
out
where
the
foreign
devil
be
,
'
continue
my
informant
,
'
our
chap
could
have
knock
a
good
many
of
them
out
with
our
four
-
point
-
seven
,
especially
if
we
could
have
get
a
go
at
them
before
they
get
within
range
themselves
.
<EOS>
but
they
must
have
somehow
contrive
to
get
them
into
position
during
the
night
,
for
we
see
nothing
of
them
come
up
.
<EOS>
They
be
somewhere
about
Chatley
,
Fairstead
Lodge
,
and
Little
Leighs
,
but
as
we
can
not
locate
them
exactly
,
and
only
have
ten
gun
up
here
,
it
do
not
give
us
much
chance
,
do
it
?
'
<EOS>
later
I
see
an
officer
of
the
Dorsets
,
who
confirm
the
gunner
's
story
,
but
add
that
our
people
be
well
entrenched
and
the
gun
well
conceal
,
so
that
none
of
the
latter
have
be
put
out
of
action
,
and
he
think
we
should
be
able
to
hold
on
to
the
hill
all
right
.
<EOS>
I
regain
my
car
without
further
adventure
,
bar
several
narrow
escape
from
stray
shell
,
and
make
my
way
back
as
quickly
as
possible
to
Chelmsford
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
firing
go
on
all
day
,
not
only
to
the
northward
,
but
also
away
to
the
southward
,
where
the
Saxons
,
while
not
make
any
determined
attack
,
keep
the
Vth
Corps
continually
on
the
alert
,
and
there
be
an
almost
continuous
duel
between
the
heavy
piece
.
<EOS>
as
it
appear
certain
that
the
knoll
I
have
visit
in
the
forenoon
be
the
main
objective
of
the
enemy
's
attack
,
reinforcement
have
be
more
than
once
send
up
there
,
but
the
german
shell
fire
be
so
heavy
that
they
find
it
almost
impossible
to
construct
the
additional
cover
require
.
<EOS>
several
battery
of
artillery
be
despatch
to
Pleshy
and
Rolphy
Green
to
keep
down
,
if
possible
,
the
fire
of
the
Germans
,
but
it
seem
to
increase
rather
than
diminish
.
<EOS>
They
must
have
have
more
gun
in
action
than
they
have
at
first
.
<EOS>
just
at
dusk
their
infantry
have
make
the
first
openly
offensive
movement
.
 
<EOS>
"
several
line
of
skirmisher
suddenly
appear
in
the
valley
between
Little
Leighs
and
Chatley
,
and
advanced
towards
Lyonshall
Wood
,
at
the
north
end
of
the
knoll
east
of
Little
Waltham
.
<EOS>
They
be
at
first
invisible
from
the
british
gun
position
on
the
other
side
of
the
Chelmer
,
and
when
they
clear
the
spur
on
which
Hyde
Hall
stand
they

their

as
they
get
within

but
they
be
still
subject
to
the
infernal
rafale
from
the
hanoverian
gun
on

and
to
make

bad
at

<EOS>
the
Xth
Corps
bring
a
long
line
of
gun
into
action
between

Great
Leighs
Wood
,
in
which
position
none
of
the
british
gun

<EOS>
under

hurricane
of

the
british
fire
be
quite
beat
down

and
the
Germans
follow
up
their
skirmisher

solid

advance

impunity

the
fire
of

gun
at

there
they

fire
almost
at

the

could
not
be
certain
of
the

whereabout
of
their
objective

<EOS>
there
be
a
searchlight
on

at

it

demolish

,
alas

be
hurry
up
from

available
source
,
but
they
only
arrive
in
time
to
be
carry
down
the
hill
again
in
the
rush
of
its
defeat
defender
,
and
to
share
with
them
the
storm
of
projectile
from
the
quick
-
firer
of
General
von
Kronhelm
's
artillery
,
which
have
be
push
forward
during
the
assault
.
<EOS>
It
be
with
the
great
difficulty
that
the
shatter
and
disorganise
troop
be
get
over
the
river
at
Little
Waltham
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
hundred
be
drown
in
the
little
stream
,
and
hundred
of
other
kill
and
wound
by
the
fire
of
the
Germans
.
<EOS>
They
have
win
the
first
trick
.
<EOS>
this
be
indisputable
,
and
as
ill
news
travel
apace
,
a
feeling
of
gloom
fall
upon
our
whole
force
,
for
it
be
realise
that
the
possession
of
the
capture
knoll
would
enable
the
enemy
to
mass
troop
almost
within
effective
rifle
range
of
our
river
line
of
defence
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
it
be
propose
by
some
officer
on
the
staff
that
we
should
wheel
back
our
left
and
take
up
a
fresh
position
during
the
night
.
<EOS>
this
be
overrule
,
as
it
be
recognise
that
to
do
so
would
enable
the
enemy
to
push
in
between
the
Dunmow
force
and
our
own
,
and
so
cut
our
general
line
in
half
.
<EOS>
all
that
could
be
do
be
to
get
up
every
available
gun
and
bombard
the
hill
during
the
night
in
order
to
hamper
the
enemy
in
his
preparation
for
further
forward
movement
and
in
his
entrench
operation
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
we
more
man
at
our
disposal
<EOS>
I
suppose
there
be
little
doubt
that
a
strong
counter
-
attack
would
have
be
make
on
the
knoll
almost
immediately
;
but
in
the
face
of
the
enormous
number
oppose
to
us
,
I
imagine
that
General
Blennerhasset
do
not
feel
justified
in
denude
any
portion
of
our
position
of
its
defender
.
<EOS>
so
all
through
the
dark
hour
the
thunder
of
the
great
gun
go
on
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
the
cannonade
the
Germans
turn
on
no
less
than
three
searchlight
from
the
southern
end
of
the
knoll
about
midnight
.
<EOS>
two
be
at
once
put
out
by
our
fire
,
but
the
third
manage
to
exist
for
over
half
an
hour
,
and
enable
the
Germans
to
see
how
hard
we
be
work
to
improve
our
defence
along
the
river
bank
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
that
they
be
by
this
mean
able
to
make
themselves
acquaint
with
the
position
of
a
great
number
of
our
trench
.
<EOS>
during
the
night
our
patrol
report
be
unable
to
penetrate
beyond
Pratt
's
Farm
,
Mount
Maskell
,
and
Porter

on

Colchester

.
<EOS>
everywhere
they
be
force

by
superior

.
<EOS>
the
enemy
be
fast
close
in
upon
us
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
terrible
night
in
Chelmsford
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
panic
on

hand

<EOS>
a

mount

harangue
the

urge
the
people
to
rise

compel
the

a

which

where

<EOS>
the
preparation
of
the
London
line
be
a
stupendous
undertaking
,
but
the
grow
scarceness
and
dearness
of

time
of
peril
.
<EOS>
thousand
of
man
come
forward
ask
to
be
enlist
and
arm
.
<EOS>
the
difficulty
be
to
find
enough
weapon
and
ammunition
for
them
,
to
say
nothing
of
the
question
of
uniform
and
equipment
,
which
loom
very
large
indeed
.
<EOS>
the
attitude
of
the
Germans
,
as
set
forth
in
Von
Kronhelm
's
proclamation
,
preclude
the
employment
of
fight
man
dress
in
civilian
garb
,
and
their
attitude
be
a
perfectly
natural
and
justifiable
one
by
all
the
law
and
custom
of

.
 
<EOS>
It
become
necessary
,
therefore
,
that
all

should
be
dress

another

in

"
all
the

even
though
those
who

<EOS>
only
the
time
during
which
these

be
wait
for

be
spend
in
drill
in

of

<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
be
clothe

they
be
despatch
to
that
portion
of
the

to
which
their

be
allocate

there

in
the
interval
of
their
clearing
and
dig
operation
,
they
be
hustle
through
a
brief
musketry
course
,
which
consist
for
the
most
part
in
firing
.
<EOS>
the
question
of
the
provision
of
officer
and
N.C.O.
's
be
an
almost
insuperable
one
.
<EOS>
retire
man
come
forward
on
every
side
,
but
the
supply
be
by
no
mean
equal
to
the
demand
,
and
they
themselves
in
many
instance
be
absolutely
out
of
date
as
far
as
knowledge
of
modern
arm
and
condition
be
concern
.
<EOS>
however
,
every
one
,
with
but
very
few
exception
,
do
his
utmost
,
and
by
the
11th
or
12th
of
the
month
the
entrenchment
be
practically
complete
,
and
man
by
upward
of
150,000
"
man
with
musket
"
of
stout
heart
and
full
of
patriotism
,
but
in
reality
nothing
but
an
army
_
pour

_
so
far
as
efficiency
be
concern
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
part
of
the
gun
be
also
place
in
position
,
especially
on
the
north
and
eastern
portion
of
the
line
,
and
the
remainder
be
be
mount
as
fast
as
it
be
practicable
.
<EOS>
They
be
well
man
by
Volunteer
and
Militia
Artillerymen
,
draw
from
every
district
which
the
invader
have
leave
accessible
.
<EOS>
by
the
13th
the
eastern
section
of
the
fortification
be
strengthen
by
the
arrival
of
the
remnant
of
the
Ist
and
Vth
Army
Corps
,
which
have
be
so
badly
defeat
at
Chelmsford
,
and
no
time
be
lose
in
reorganise
them
and
distribute
them
along
the
line
,
thereby
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
leaven
the
unbaked
mass
of
their
improvise
defender
.
<EOS>
It
be
generally
expect
that
the
enemy
would
follow
up
the
success
by
an
immediate
attack
on
Brentwood
,
the
main
barrier
between
Von
Kronhelm
and
his
objective
--
our
great
Metropolis
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
it
turn
out
,
he
have
a
totally
different
scheme
in
hand
.
<EOS>
the
order
to
Lord
Byfield
to
evacuate
the
position
he
have
maintain
with
such
credit
against
the
german
Garde
and
IVth
Corps
have
already
be
refer
to
.
<EOS>
Their
reason
be
obvious
.
<EOS>
now
that
there
be
no
organise
resistance
on
his
right
<EOS>
,
he
stand
in
danger
of
be
cut
off
from
London
,
the
defence
of
which
be
now
in
press
need
of
his

<EOS>
a
large
amount
of
roll
stock
be
at
once
despatch
to
Saffron
Walden
and
Buntingford
by
the
g.e.r.
and
to
Baldock
by
the
G.N.R.

to
facilitate
the
withdrawal
of
his

and
he
be

as

how
these

in

<EOS>
the
evacuation
of

position
could
not
possibly
have
be
carry
out
in
good
order
on
such
short
notice
,
have
not
Lord
Byfield
previously
work
the
whole
thing
out
in
readiness
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
help
feel
that
,
despite
his
glorious
victory
on
the
ninth
,
a
turn
of
Fortune
's
wheel
may
necessitate
a
retirement
on
London
sooner
or
later
,
and
,
like
the
good
General
that
he
be
,
he
make
every
preparation
both
for
this
,
and
other
eventuality
.
<EOS>
among
other
detail
,
he
have
arrange
that
the
mount
infantry
should
be
provide
with
plenty
of
strong
light
wire
.
<EOS>
this
be
intend
for
the
express
benefit
of
Froelich
's
formidable
cavalry
brigade
,
which
he
foresaw
would
be
most
dangerous
to
his
command
in
the
event
of
a
retreat
.
<EOS>
as
soon
,
therefore
,
as
the
retrograde
movement
commence
,
the
mount
infantry
begin
to
stretch
their
wire
across
every
road
,
lane
and
byway
lead
to
the
north
and
north
-
east
.
<EOS>
some
wire
be
lay
low
,
within
a
foot
of
the
ground
,
other
high
up
,
where
they
could
catch
a
rider
about
the
neck
or
breast
.
<EOS>
this
operation
they
carry
out
again
and
again
,
after
the
troop
have
pass
,
at
various
point
on
the
route
of
the

at

,
his
rider
be
confine
to
the

,
and
the
accident
and
delay
occasion
by
the
wire
be
so
numerous
and
disconcert
that
their
advance
have
to
be
conduct
with
such
caution
that
as
a
pursuit
it
be
of
no
use
at
all
.
<EOS>
even
the
infantry
and
heavy
gun
of
the
retire
British
get
over
the
ground
nearly
twice
as
fast
.
<EOS>
after
two
or
three
hour
of
this
,
only
vary
by
occasional
volley
from
detachment
of
our
mount
infantry
,
who
sometimes
wait
in
rear
of
their
snare
to
let
fly
at
the
German

before
gallop
back
to

other
,
the
enemy
recognise
the
fact
,
and
,
withdraw
their

till
daylight
,
replace
them
by
infantry
,
but
so
much
time
have
be
lose
,
that
the

get
several
mile

<EOS>
as

chronicle

the
brigade
of
four
regular

somewhere
<EOS>
about
10.30
p.m.
<EOS>
the

be
clear

and
they
arrive
at
Sawbridgeworth
in
four
long
train
in
a
little
under
an
hour
.
<EOS>
Their
advent
do
not
arouse
the

as
the

lie
nearly
three

quarter
of
a

distant
on
the
further
side

<EOS>
It
may
be
note
in
pass
that
while
the
Stort
be
but
a
small
stream
,
easily
fordable
in

yet
it
be
important

<EOS>
moreover
,
the
Great
Eastern
Railway
cross
the
river
by
a
wooden
bridge
just
north
of

,
and
it
be
necessary
to
ensure
the
safe
passage
of
the

of
Sheering
village
become
too
much
for
the
four
4.7
gun
on
the
open
ground
to
the
south
.
 
<EOS>
Their
gunner
be
shoot
down
as
fast
as
they
touch
their
weapon
,
and
when
the
german
field
battery
at
Newman
's
end
,
which
have
be
advance
several
hundred
yard
,
suddenly
open
a
flank
fire
of
shrapnel
upon
them
,
it
be
find
absolutely
impossible
to
serve
them
.
<EOS>
a
gallant
attempt
be
make
to
withdraw
them
by
the
Harlow
Road
,
but
their
team
be
shoot
down
as
soon
as
they
appear
.
<EOS>
this
enfilade
fire
,
too
,
decimate
the
Grenadiers
and
the
remnant
of
the
Scots
,
though
they
fight
on
to
the
death
,
and
a
converging
attack
of
a
battalion
from
Down
Hall
and
another
from
sheer
drive
them
down
into
the
ground
of
Durrington
House
,
where
fighting
still
go
on
savagely
for
some
time
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
Von
der
Rudesheim
have
all
but
attain
a
portion
of
his
object
,
which
be
to
establish
his
gun
in
such
a
position
that
they
could
fire
on
the
main
body
of
the
british
troop
when
they
enter
Sawbridgeworth
by
the
Cambridge
Road
.
<EOS>
the
place
where
the
four
gun
with
the
Grenadiers
have
be
station
be
within
3,000
yard
of
any
part
of
that
road
between
Harlow
and
Sawbridgeworth
.
<EOS>
but
this
spot
be
still
expose
to
the
rifle
fire
of
the
Seaforths
who
hold
Quickbury
.
<EOS>
Von
der
Rudesheim
therefore
determine
to
swing
forward
his
left
,
and
either
drive
them
back
down
the
hill
towards
the
river
,
or
at
least
to
so
occupy
them
that
he
could
bring
up
his
field
-
gun
to
their
choose
position
without
lose
too
many
of
his
gunner
.
 
<EOS>
by
six
o'clock
,
thank
to
his
enormous
local
superiority
in
number
,
he
have
contrive
to
do
this
,
and
now
the
oppose
force
with
the
exception
of
the
British
Grenadiers
,
who
still
fight
with
a
german
battalion
between
Durrington
House
and
Harlow
,
face
each
other
north
and
south
,
instead
of
east
and
west
,
as
they
be
at
the
beginning
of
the
fight
.
<EOS>
Brigadier
-
General
Lane
-
Edgeworth
,
who
be
in
command
of
the
British
,
have
be
send
urgent
message
for
reinforcement
to
the
Dunmow
Force
,
but
when
its
command
officer
finally
decide
to
turn
his
full
strength
in
the
direction
of
the
firing
,
it
take
so
long
to
assemble
and
form
up
the
Volunteer
regiment
who
compose
the
bulk
of
his
command
,
that
it
be
past
seven
before
the
lead
battalion
have
deploy
to
assist
in
the
attack
which
it
be
decide
to
make
against
the
german
right
.
<EOS>
meantime
,
other
important
event
have
transpire
.
 
<EOS>
Von
der
Rudesheim
have
find
that
the
battalion
which
be
engage
with
the
Grenadiers
could
not
get
near
Harlow
village
,
or
either
the
river
or
railway
bridge
at
that
place
,
both
of
which
he
wish
to
destroy
.
<EOS>
but
his
scout
have
report
a
lock
and
wooden
footbridge
immediately
to
the
westward
between
Harlow
and
Sawbridgeworth
,
just
abreast
of
the
large
wooded
park
surround
Pishobury
House
on
the
farther
side
.
<EOS>
He
determine
to
send
two
company
over
by
this
,
their
movement
be
hide
from
the
English
by
the
tree
.
<EOS>
after
cross
,
they
find
themselves
confront
by
a
backwater
,
but
,
train
in
cross
river
,
they
manage
to
ford
and
swim
over
,
and
advance
through
the
park
towards
Harlow
Bridge
.
<EOS>
while
this
be
in
progress
,
a
large
force
be
report
march
south
on
the
Cambridge
Road
.
 
<EOS>
while
Von
der
Rudesheim
,
who
be
at
the
western
end
of
Sheering
hamlet
,
be
look
through
his
glass
at
the
new
arrival
on
the
scene
of
action
--
who
be
without
doubt
the
main
body
of
the
Royston
command
,
which
be
retire
under
the
personal
supervision
of
Lord
Byfield
--
a
puff
of
white
smoke
rise
above
the
tree
about
Hyde
Hall
,
and
at
top
speed
four
heavily
load
train
shoot
into
sight
go
south
.
<EOS>
these
be
the
same
one
that
have
bring
down
the
regular
british
troop
,
with
whom
he
be
now
engage
.
<EOS>
They
have
go
north
again
,
and
pick
up
a
number
of
Volunteer
battalion
belong
to
the
retreat
force
just
beyond
Bishop
's
Stortford
.
<EOS>
but
so
long
a
time
have
be
take
in
entrain
the
troop
in
the
darkness
and
confusion
of
the
retreat
,
that
their
comrade
who
have
keep
to
the
road
,
arrive
almost
simultaneously
.
<EOS>
Von
der
Rudesheim
signal
,
and
send
urgent
order
for
his
gun
to
be
bring
up
to
open
fire
on
them
,
but
by
the
time
the
first
team
have
reach
him
the
last
of
the
train
have
disappear
from
sight
into
the
cutting
at
Harlow
Station
.
<EOS>
but
even
now
it
be
not
too
late
to
open
fire
on
the
troop
enter
Sawbridgeworth
.
 
<EOS>
thing
be
begin
to
look
somewhat
bad
for
Von
der
Rudesheim
's
little
force
.
<EOS>
the
pressure
from
the
north
be
increase
every
moment
,
his
attack
on
the
retreat
troop
have
fail
,
he
have
not
so
far
be
able
to
destroy
the
bridge
at
Harlow
,
and
every
minute
the
likelihood
of
his
be
able
to
do
so
grow
more
remote
.
<EOS>
to
crown
all
,
word
be
bring
him
that
the
train
which
have
just
slip
by
be
disgorging
man
in
hundred
along
the
railway
west
of
Harlow
Station
,
and
that
these
troop
be
begin
to
move
forward
as
if
to
support
the
British
Grenadiers
,
who
have
be
drive
back
towards
Harlow
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
he
see
that
there
be
even
a
possibility
of
his
be
surround
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
no
intention
of
discontinue
the
fight
.
<EOS>
He
know
he
could
rely
on
the
discipline
and
mobility
of
his
well
-
train
man
under
almost
any
condition
,
and
he
trust
,
moreover
,
that
the
promise
reinforcement
would
not
be
very
long
in
turn
up
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
hold
on
just
where
he
be
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
,
by
various
adroit
manoeuvre
,
throw
back
his
right
to
Down
Hall
,
whose
copse
and
plantation
afford
a
good
deal
of
cover
,
and
,
use
this
as
a
pivot
,
gradually
wheel
back
his
left
till
he
have
take
up
a
position
run
north
and
south
from
Down
Hall
to
Matching
Tye
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
effect
this
difficult
manoeuvre
without
considerable
loss
,
but
he
experience
less
difficulty
in
extricate
his
left
than
he
have
anticipate
,
since
the
newly
arrive
british
troop
at
Harlow
,
instead
of
press
forward
against
him
,
have
be
engage
in
move
into
a
position
between
Harlow
and
the
hamlet
of
Foster
Street
,
on
the
somewhat
elevated
ground
to
the
south
of
Matching
,
which
would
enable
them
to
cover
the
further
march
of
the
main
body
of
the
retreat
troop
to
Epping
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
totally
lose
the
two
company
he
have
send
across
the
river
to
attack
Harlow
Bridge
.
<EOS>
unfortunately
for
them
,
their
arrival
on
the
Harlow
-
Sawbridgeworth
Road
synchronise
with
that
of
the
advanced
guard
of
Lord
Byfield

.
<EOS>
some
hot
skirmishing
take
place
in
and
out
among
the
tree
of
Pishobury
,
and
finally
the
Germans
be
drive
to
earth
in
the
big
square
block
of
the
red

itself
.
 
<EOS>
here
they
make
a
desperate

hard
as
they

from
one
storey
to
another

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
by
eight

I
be
off
in
my
car
for
the
scene
of
action
,
for
rumour
of
fighting
near
Harlow
have
already
begin
to
come
in
.
<EOS>
I
start
out
by
way
of
Tottenham
and
Edmonton
,
expect
to
reach
Harlow
by
9.30
or
10
.
<EOS>
but
I
reckon
without
the
numerous
military
official
with
whom
I
come
in
contact
,
who
constantly
stop
me
and
send
me
out
of
my
way
on
one
pretext

another
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
hope
that
the
nation
have
benefit
by
their
proceeding

<EOS>
in
the
end
it
be
close
on
one
before
I
pull
up
at
the
Cock
Inn
,
Epping
,
in
search
of
additional
information
,
because
for
some
time
I
have
be
aware
of
the
rumble
growl
of
heavy
artillery
from
the
eastward
,
and
wonder
what
it
may
portend
.
<EOS>
I
find
that
General
Sir
Stapleton
Forsyth
,
who
command
the
northern
section
of
the
defence
,
have
make
the
inn
his

<EOS>
on
inquiry
I
hear
that
the
enemy
be
say
to
be
bombard
Kelvedon
Hatch

and
also
that
the

our
retreat
column
be
only
three

four
mile
distant

I
push
on
,
and
,
after
the
usual
interrogation
from
an
officer
in
charge
of
a
picket
,
where
the
road
run
through
the
entrenchment
about
a
mile
farther
on
,
find
myself
spin
along
through
the
country
in
the
direction

Harlow

<EOS>
as
I
begin
to
ascend
the
rise
ground
towards
Potter
Street
<EOS>
I
could
hear
a
continuous
roll
of
artillery
away
to
my
right
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
distinguish
anything
except
the
smoke
of
shell
burst
here
and
there
in
the
distance
,
on
account
of
the
scatter
tree
which
line
the
maze
of

deep

turn
to

meet
previously
,
but
still
show
trace
of
their
hard
marching
and
fighting
.
<EOS>
many
of
them
be
wear
bandage
,
but
all
the
more
seriously
wound
have
be
leave
behind
to
be
look
after
by
the
Germans
.
<EOS>
all
this
time
the
firing
be
still
resound
heavy
and
constant
from
the
north
-
east
,
and
from
one
person
and
another
whom
I
question
<EOS>
I
ascertain
that
the
enemy
be
advance
upon
us
from
that
direction
.
<EOS>
half
a
mile
farther
on
<EOS>
I
run
into
the
middle
of
the
fighting
.
<EOS>
the
road
run
along
the
top
of
a
kind
of
flat
ridge
or
upland
,
whence
<EOS>
I
could
see
to
a
considerable
distance
on
either
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
partially
shelter
from
the

by
its
hedge
and
the

of
Foster

irregular

nearly

<EOS>
beyond
them
be
yet
other
direct
north
.
<EOS>
there
be
field
battery
and
big
4.7
's
.
<EOS>
all
be
hard
at
work
,
their
gunner
work
like
man
possess
,
and
the
crash
of
their
constant
discharge
be
ear
-
splitting
.
<EOS>
I
have
hardly
take
this
in
when
'
Bang

dazzling

open
in

shrapnel

rattle
on

,
wall
,
and
roof
with
a
sound
as
of
handful
of
pebble
throw
on
a

<EOS>
but
the
hardness
with
which
they
strike
be
beyond
anything
in
my
experience

<EOS>
"
It
be
not
pleasant
to
be
here
,
but
I
run
my
car
behind
a
little
public
-
house
that
stand
by
the
wayside
,
and
,
dismount
,
unslung
my

determine
to
get
what

I
could
from
the
corner
of
the

<EOS>
all
around
khaki

clothe

farther
off
,
in
the
low
ground
,
from
a
mile
to
a
mile
and
a
half
away
<EOS>
I
could
distinguish
the
closely

pack
firing
line
of
the
Germans
advance
slowly
but
steadily
,
despite
the
gap
make
in
their
rank
by
the
fire
of
our
gun

<EOS>
Their
own

I
fancy
,
I
could
make
out
near
Tilegate
Green
to
the

<EOS>
neither

have
as
yet
open

fire

<EOS>
get
into

back

it
be
so
block
by
the
procession
of
waggon
and
troop
of
the

that
I
could
not
turn
into
it

<EOS>
wheeling
round
I
make
my
way
back
to
a
parallel
lane
I
have
notice
,
and
turn
to
the

again
at
a
smithy

find
myself
in
a

border
by

<EOS>
here
I
find
the

I
have
lately

there
be

I

extensive

<EOS>
to

an

along

<EOS>
this

"
I
have
spend
a
busy
day
,
but
have
no
very
important
news
to
record
.
<EOS>
after
the
repulse
of
the
german
troop
attack
Lord
Byfield
's
retreat
army
and
the
arrival
of
our
sorely
harass
troop
behind
the
epping
entrenchment
,
we
see
no
more
of
the
enemy
that
evening
.
<EOS>
all
through
the
night
,
however
,
there
be
the
sound
of
occasional
heavy
gun
fire
from
the
eastward
.
<EOS>
I
have
take
up
my
quarter
at
the
Bell
,
an
inn
at
the
south
end
of
the
village
,
from
the
back
of
which
I
can
get
a
good
view
to
the
north
-
west
for
from
two
to
four
mile
.
<EOS>
beyond
that
distance
the
high
ridge
know
as
Epping
Upland
limit
the
prospect
.
<EOS>
the
whole
terrain
be
cut
up
into
field
of
various
size
and
dot
all
over
with
tree
.
<EOS>
close
by
be
a
lofty
red
brick
water
-
tower
,
which
have
be
utilise
by
Sir
Stapleton
Forsyth
as
a
signal
station
.
<EOS>
away
about
a
mile
to
my
left
front
as
I
look
from
the
back
of
the
Bell
a
big
block
of
building
stand
prominently
out
on
a
grassy
spur
of
high
ground
.
<EOS>
this
be
Copped
Hall
and
Little
Copped
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
"
both
mansion
have
be
transform
into
fortress
,
which
,
while
offer
little
or
no
resistance
to
artillery
fire
,
will
yet
form
a
tough
nut
for
the
Germans
to
crack
,
should
they
succeed
in
get
through
our
entrenchment
at
that
point
.
<EOS>
beyond
,
I
can
just
see
a
corner
of
a
big
earthwork
that
have
be
build
to
strengthen
the
defence
line
,
and
which
have
be
christen
Fort
Obelisk
from
a
farm
of
that
name
,
near
which
it
be
situate
.
<EOS>
there
be
another
small
redoubt
on
the
slope
just
below
this
hostelry
,
and
I
can
see
the
gunner
busy
about
the
three
big
khaki
-
paint
gun
which
be
mount
in
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
6-inch
and
two
4.7-inch
gun
I
believe
.
<EOS>
this
morning
our
cavalry
,
consist
of
a
regiment
of
yeomanry
and
some
mount
infantry
,
who
have
form
a
portion
of
Lord
Byfield
's
force
,
go
out
to
reconnoitre
towards
the
north
and
east
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
away
long
,
as
they
be
drive
back
in
every
direction
in
which
they
attempt
to
advance
,
by
superior
force
of
the
enemy
's
cavalry
,
who
seem
to
swarm
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
"
later
on
,
I
believe
,
some
of
the
german
reiter
become
so
venturesome
that
several
squadron
expose
themselves
to
the
fire
of
the
big
gun
in
the
fort
at
Skip
's
Corner
,
and
suffer
pretty
severely
for
their
temerity
.
<EOS>
the
firing
continue
throughout
the
morning
away
to
eastward
.
<EOS>
at
noon
I
think
I
would
run
down
and
see
if
I
could
find
anything
out
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
mount
my
car
and
run
off
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
I
find
that
there
be
a
regular
duel
go
on
between
our
gun
at
Kelvedon
Hatch
and
some
heavy
siege
gun
or
howitzer
that
the
enemy
have
get
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
high
ground
about
Norton
Heath
,
only
about
3,000
yard
distant
from
our
entrenchment
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
appear
to
have
do
us
much
damage
,
but
neither
,
in
all
probability
,
do
we
hurt
them
very
much
,
since
our
gunner
be
unable
to
exactly
locate
the
hostile
gun
.
 
<EOS>
"
when
I
get
back
to
Epping
,
about
three
o'clock
,
I
find
the
wide
single
street
full
of
troop
.
<EOS>
They
be
those
who
have
come
in
the
previous
afternoon
with
Lord
Byfield
,
and
who
,
have
be
allow
to
rest
till
midday
after
their
long
fighting
march
,
be
now
be
tell
off
to
their
various
section
of
the
defence
line
.
<EOS>
the
Guard
regiment
be
allocate
to
the
northernmost
position
between
Fort
Royston
and
Fort
Skips
.
<EOS>
the
rifle
be
to
go
to
Copped
Hall
,
and
the
Seaforths
to
form
the
nucleus
of
a
central
reserve
of
Militia
and
Volunteers
,
which
be
be
establish
just
north
of
Gaynes
Park
.
<EOS>
eppe
itself
and
the
contiguous
entrenchment
be
confide
to
the
Leinster
Regiment
,
which
alone
of
Sir
Jacob
Stellenbosch
's

have
escape
capture
,
support
by
two
Militia
battalion
.
<EOS>
the
field
battery
be
distribute
under
shelter
of
the
wood
on
the
south
,
east
,
and
north
-
east
of
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
"
during
the
afternoon
the
welcome
news
arrive
that
the
remainder
of
Lord
Byfield
's
command
from
Baldock
,
Royston
,
and
Elmdon
have
safely
arrive
within
our
entrenchment
at
Enfield
and
New
Barnet
.
<EOS>
We
may
now
hope
that
what
with
Regulars
,
Militia
,
Volunteers
,
and
the
new
levy
,
our
line
be
fully
and
effectively
man
,
and
will
suffice
to
stay
the
further
advance
of
even
such
a
formidable
host
as
be
that
at
the
disposal
of
the
renowned
Von
Kronhelm
.
<EOS>
It
be
report
too
,
from
Brentwood
,
that
great
progress
have
already
be
make
in
reorganise
and
distribute
the
broken
remnant
of
the
1st
and
5th
army
that
get
back
to
that
town
after
the
great
and
disastrous
battle
of
Chelmsford
.
<EOS>
victorious
as
they
be
,
the
Germans
must
also
have
suffer
severely
,
which
may
give
us
some
breathing
time
before
their
next
onslaught

near
the
body
of
a
german
officer
after
the
fighting
in
the
neighbourhood

Chase

It
be
presume
that
the
officer
in
question
be
Major
Splittberger

of

Kaiser
Franz

since
that

write
inside

from
enquiry
that
have
since
be
institute
,
it
be
probable
that
the
deceased
officer
be
employ
on
the
staff
of
the
General
command
the
IVth
Corps
of
the
invade
Army
,
though
it
would
seem
from
the
content
of
his
diary
that
he
see
also
a
good
deal
of
the
operation
of

Xth
Corps

Our

will
be
able
to
gather
from

the
general
course
of
the

's
strategy
and

most
recent

the
bold

of

in
push
the
great

Xth

directly
to

we
gain
a
good
foothold
inside

defence

I
do
not

it
will
be

go
on

yesterday

<EOS>
We
have
take
the
redoubt
at
North
Weald
Basset
and
drive
the
English
back
into
the
belt
of
burnt
woodland
,

pour

on

We
set
the

on
fire
three
time

the
British
contrive
to
extinguish
the
blaze
on

still
progress

fighting

now
all

continuous
.
<EOS>
how
long
it
may
last
I
have
no
idea
.
<EOS>
probably
there
will
be
no
suspension
of
the
struggle
until
we
be
actually
master
of
the
Metropolis
.
<EOS>
We
take
advantage
of
the
darkness
to
push
forward
our
man
to
within
three
thousand
yard
of
the
enemy
's
line
,
place
them
as
far
as
possible
under

cover

at
4
a.m.
the
General
order
his

to
assemble
at
Latton
Park
,
where
he
have
establish
his
headquarters

<EOS>
He
unfold
to
us
the
general
outline
of
the
attack
,
which
,
he
now
announce
,
be
to
commence
at
six
precisely
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
myself
that
it
be
a
somewhat
inopportune
time
,
as
we
should
have
the
rise
sun
right
in
our
eye
;
but
I
imagine
that
the
idea
be
to
have
as
much
daylight
as
possible
before
us
.
<EOS>
for
although
we
have
employ
a
night
attack
against
Skip
's
Corner
,
and
successfully
too
,
yet
the
general
feeling
in
our
Army
have
always
be
oppose
to
operation
of
this
kind
.
<EOS>
the
possible
gain
be
,
I
think
,
in
no
way
commensurable
with
the
probable
risk
of
panic
and
disorder
.
<EOS>
the
principal
objective
be
the
village
of
eppe
itself
;
but
simultaneous
attack
be
to
be
carry
out
against
Copped
Hall
,
Fort
Obelisk
,
to
the
west
of
it
,
and
Fort
Royston
,
about
a
mile
north
of
the
village

<EOS>
the
IXth
Corps
be
to
co
-
operate
by
a
determined
attempt
to
break
through
the
English
line
the
burn
strip
of
woodland
and
to
assault
the
latter
fort
in
rear
.
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
to
carry
out
both
these
flank
attack
in
order
to
prevent
the
main
attack
from
be
enfilade
from
right
and
leave
.
<EOS>
at
5.30
we
mount
,
and
ride
off
to
Rye
Hill
about
a
couple
of
mile
distant
,
from
which
the
General
intend
to
watch
the
progress
of
the
operation
.
<EOS>
the
first
ray
of
the
rise
sun
be
fill
the
eastern
sky
with
a
pale
light

we
canter
off

distinctly
visible

attract
the

itself
hear
even
above
the
rolling

the
roar

easily
distinguishable

<EOS>
none

a
great

an

"
at
daybreak
this
morning
I
be
in
Epping

see
the
beginning
of
the
attack
on
the
Forest

<EOS>
It
be
rumour
that
large
reinforcement
have
reach
the
enemy
from
London
,
but
as
these
must
be
merely
scratch
soldier
they
will
do
them
more
harm
than
good
in
their
cramp
position
.
<EOS>
the
Xth
Corps
have
get
a
dozen
battery
in
position
a
little
to
the
eastward
of
the
village
,
and
at
six
o'clock
these
gun
open
a
tremendous
fire
upon
the
north
-
east
corner
of
the
Forest
,
under
cover
of
which
their
infantry
deploy
down
in
the
low
ground
about
Coopersale
,
and
advance
to
the
attack
.
<EOS>
Petrol
shell
be
not
use
against
the

,
as
Von
Kronhelm
have
give
order
that
it
be
not
to
be
burn
if
it
could
possibly
be
avoid
.
<EOS>
the
shrapnel
be
very
successful
in
keep
down
the
fire
from
the
edge
of
the
tree
,
but
our
troop
receive
a
good
deal
of
damage
from
infantry

gun
that
be
post
to
the
east
of
the
Forest
on

hill
near

about
seven
o'clock
these

follow
this
up
by
put
some

his
own
gun
up
there

which
be
able
to
fire
on
the
edge

those
of

mount
gun

pass
through
Epping
,
go
south
-
east

<EOS>
It
be
generally
suppose
that
it
be
either
to
attack
the
British
at
Brentwood
in
the
rear
,
or
,
which
I
think
be
more
probable
,
to
intimidate
the
raw
levy
by
its
presence
between
them
and
London
,
and
to
attack
them
in
flank
<EOS>
should
they
attempt
to
retreat
.
 
<EOS>
"
just
after
eleven
another
battalion
arrive
at
Copped
Hall
from
Epping
,
and
order
be
give
that
the
english
position
along
the
edge
of
the
Forest
be
to
be
take
at
all
cost
.
<EOS>
just
before
the
attack
begin
there
be
a
great
deal
of
firing
somewhere
in
the
interior
of
the
Forest
,
presumably
between
the
british
and
the
advanced
troop
of
the
Xth
Corps
.
<EOS>
however
this
may
have
be
,
it
be
evident
that
the
enemy
be
hold
our
part
of
the
Forest
much
less
strongly
and
our
assault
be
entirely
successful
,
with
but
small
loss
of
man
.
<EOS>
once
in
the
wood
,
the
superior
training
and
discipline
of
our
man
tell
heavily
in
their
favour
.
<EOS>
while
the
mingle
mass
of
volunteer
and
raw
free
-
shooter
,
of
which
the
bulk
of
their
garrison
be
compose
,
get
utterly
disorganise
and
out
of
hand
under
the
severe
strain
on
them
that
be
impose
by
the
difficulty
of
wood
fighting
,
and
hinder
and
break
up
the
regular
unit
,
our
people
be
easily
keep
well
in
hand
,
and
drive
the
enemy
steadily
before
them
without
a
single
check
.
<EOS>
the
rattle
of
rifle
and
machine
gun
be
continuous
through
all
the
leafy
dell
and
glade
of
the
wood
,
but
by
two
o'clock
practically
the
whole
Forest
be
in
the
hand
of
our
Xth
Corps
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
the
turn
of
the
IVth
Corps
,
who
in
the
meantime
,
far
from
be
idle
,
have
mass
a
large
number
of
their
gun
at
Copped
Hall
,
from
which
,
aid
by
the
fire
from
Fort
Obelisk
,
the
enemy
's
line
be
subject
to
a
bombardment
that
render
them
absolutely
untenable
,
and
we
could
see
company
after
company
make
their
way
to
Waltham
Abbey
.
 
<EOS>
"
at
three
the
order
for
a
general
advance
on
Waltham
Abbey
be
issue
.
<EOS>
as
the
enemy
seem
to
have
few
,
if
any
,
gun
at
this
place

it
be
determined
to
make
use
of
some
of
the
new
armoured
motor
that
accompany
the
Army
.
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
,
who
be
personally
direct
the
operation
from
Copped
Hall
,
have
cause
each
Corps
to
send
its
own
motor
to
Epping
,
so
that
we
have
something
like
thirty
at
our
disposal
.
<EOS>
these
quaint
,
grey
monster
come
down
through
the
Forest
and
advance
on
eppe
by
two
parallel
road
,
one
passing
by
the
south
of
Warlies
Park
,
the
other
be
the
main
road
from
Epping

<EOS>
It
be
a
weird
sight
to
see
these
shore
-
go
armour
-
clads
fly
down
upon
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
They
get
within
800
yard
of
the
house
,
but
the
enemy
contrive
to
block
their
further
advance
by
various
obstacle
which
they
place
on
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
about
an
hour
's
desperate
fighting
in
the
village
.
<EOS>
the
old
Abbey
Church
be
set
on
fire
by
a
stray
shell
,
the
conflagration
spread
to
the
neighbouring
house
,
and
both
british
and
Germans
be
too
busy
kill
each
other
to
put
it
out
,
the
whole
village
be
shortly
in
flame
.
<EOS>
the
British
be
finally
drive
out
of
it
,
and
across
the
river
by
five
o'clock
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
every
heavy
gun
that
could
be
get
to
bear
be
direct
on
the
fort
at
Monkham
's
Hall
,
which
,
during
the
afternoon
,
be
also
make
the
target
for
the
gun
of
the

which
co

operated
with

by
attack
the
line
at
Cheshunt
,
and
assist
us
with
its
artillery
fire
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
by
nightfall
the
fort
be
a
mass
of
smoking
earth
,
over
which
flutter
our
black
cross
flag
,
and
the
front
of
the
IVth
Corps
stretch
from
this
to
Gillwell
Park
,
four
mile
near
London

<EOS>
"
the
Xth
Corps
be
in
support
in
the
Forest
behind
us
,
and
form
also
a
front
to
cover
our
flank
,
reach
from
Chingford
to
Buckhurst
Hill

<EOS>
the
enemy
be
quite
demoralise
in
this
direction

show
no
indication
of
resume
the
engagement

as
for

who
have
establish
his

at
Havering

atte

<EOS>
We
have
drive
a
formidable
wedge
right
into
the
middle
of
the
carefully
elaborate
system
of
defence
arrange
by
the
english
general
,
and
it
will
now
be
a
miracle
if
they
can
prevent
our
entry
into

<EOS>
"
We
have
not
,
of
course
,
effect
this
without
great
loss
in
kill
and
wound
,
but
you
can
not
make
pudding
without

and
in
the
end
a
bold
and
forward
policy
be
more
economical
of
life

limb
than
attempt
to
avoid
necessary
loss

as
our

opponent
do
in
South
Africa

thereby
prolong
the
war
to
an
almost
indefinite
period

lose
many
more

just
before

out
to

after

intricate

brood
over

only
at
interval

the
dull
booming

me

_
Sept

day
we

,
I
think
,
finally
break
down
all
organise
military
opposition
in
the
field
,
though
we
may
expect
a
considerable
amount
of
street
fighting
before
reap
the
whole
fruit
of
our
victory

<EOS>
at
daybreak
we
begin
by
turn
a
heavy
fire
from
every
possible
quarter
on
the
wooded
island
form
by

various
back

to
fall
back
over

<EOS>
Our
Engineers
soon
begin
their
bridge
operation
behind
the
wood

our
infantry
,
cross
over

get
close
up
to
a
redoubt
on

take
it
by
storm

again
we

drive
out

defender
be
silence
,
and
hundred
of
prisoner
fall
into
the
german
hand
.
 
<EOS>
thus
the
last
organise
defence
of
London
have
be
break
,
and
the
barricade
alone
remain
.
 
<EOS>
the
work
of
the
german
troop
on
the
line
of
communication
in
Essex
have
for
the
past
week
be
fraught
with
danger
.
<EOS>
through
want
of
cavalry
the
British
have
be
unable
to
make
cavalry
raid
;
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
the
difficulty
be
enhance
by
the
band
of
sharpshooter
--
man
of
all
class
from
London
who
possess
a
gun
and
who
could
shoot
.
<EOS>
in
one
or
two
of
the
London
club
the
suggestion
have
first
be
moot
a
couple
of
day
after
the
outbreak
of
hostility
,
and
it
have
be
quickly
take
up
by
man
who
be
in
the
habit
of
shoot
game
,
but
have
not
have
a
military
training
.
 
<EOS>
within
three
day
about
two
thousand
man
have
form
themselves
into
band
to
take
part
in
the
struggle
and
assist
in
the
defence
of
London
.
<EOS>
They
be
practically
similar
to
the
Francs
-
tireur
of
the
Franco
-
German
War
,
for
they
go
forth
in
company
and
wage
a
guerilla
warfare
,
partly
before
the
front
and
at
the
flank
of
the
different
army
,
and
partly
at
the
communication
at
the
rear
of
the
Germans
.
<EOS>
Their
position
be
one
of
constant
peril
in
face
of
Von
Kronhelm
's
proclamation
,
yet
the
work
they
do
be
excellent
,
and
only
prove
that
if
Lord
Roberts
'
scheme
for
universal
training
have
be
adopt
the
enemy
would
never
have
reach
the
gate
of
London
with
success
.
 
<EOS>
these
brave
adventurous

,
together
with
"
the
Legion

,
"
make
their

<EOS>
Their

<EOS>
scatter
all
over
the
theatre
of
war
in
Essex
and
Suffolk
,
and
all
along
the
german
line
of
communication
,
the
"
Frontiersmen
"
rarely
venture
on
an
open
conflict
,
and
frequently
change
scene
and
point
of
attack
.
<EOS>
within
one
week
their
number
rise
to
over
8,000
,
and
,
be
well
serve
by
the
villager
,
who
act
as
scout
and
spy
for
them
,
the
Germans
find
them
very
difficult
to
get
at
.
<EOS>
usually
they
keep
their
arm
conceal
in
thicket
and
wood
,
where
they
would
lie
in
wait
for
the
Germans
.
<EOS>
They
never
come
to
close
quarter
,
but
fire
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
many
a
smart
Uhlan
fall
by
their
bullet
,
and
many
a
sentry
drop
,
shoot
by
an
unknown
hand
.
 
<EOS>
thus
they
harass
the
enemy
everywhere
.
<EOS>
at
need
they
conceal
their
arm
and
assume
the
appearance
of
inoffensive
non

combatant
.
<EOS>
but
when
catch

the
Germans
give
them
"

in

the

it

at

the

now
that
fresh

the

see
themselves
utterly

It

have
be
a
mishap
on

for
they
would
certainly
never

Bloomsbury
,
several

badly
damage

Hitherto

<EOS>
They

CHAPTER
VI
.
 
<EOS>
FALL
of
LONDON
.
  
<EOS>
outside
London
the
September
night
have
settle
down
on
the
blood
-
stain
field
of
battle
.
<EOS>
with
a
pale
light
the
moon
have
rise
,
partly
hide
by
chase
cloud
,
her
white
ray
mingle
with
the
lurid
glare
of
the
fire
down
in
the
great
terrified
Metropolis
below
.
<EOS>
northward
,
from
Hampstead
across
to
Barnet
--
indeed
,
over
that
wide
district
where
the
final
battle
have
be
so
hotly
fight
--
the
moonbeam
shine
upon
the
pallid
face
of
the
fall
.
 
<EOS>
along
the
german
line
of
investment
there
have
now
follow
upon
the
roar
of
battle
an
uncanny
silence
.
 
<EOS>
away
to
the
west
,
however
,
there
be
still
hear
the
growling
of
distant
conflict
,
now
mount
into
a
low
crackling
of
musketry
fire
,
and
again
die
away
in
muffled
sound
.
<EOS>
the
last
remnant
of
the
British
Army
be
be
hotly
pursue
in
the
direction
of
Staines
.
 
<EOS>
London
be
invest
and
bombard
,
but
not
yet
take
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
long
time
the
german
Field
Marshal
have
stand
alone
upon
Hampstead
Heath
apart
from
his
staff
,
watch
the
great
tongue
of
flame
leap
up
here
<EOS>
and
there
in
the
distant
darkness
.
<EOS>
His
grey
,
shaggy
brow
be
contract
,
his
thin
aquiline
face
thoughtful
,
his
hard
mouth
twitch
nervously
,
unable
to
fully
conceal
the
strain
of
his
own
feeling
as
conqueror
of
the
English
.
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
's
taciturnity
have
long
ago
be
proverbial
.
<EOS>
the
Kaiser
have
liken
him
to
Moltke
,
and
have
declare
that
"
he
could
be
silent
in
seven
language
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
gaze
be
one
of
musing
,
and
yet
he
be
the
most
active
of
man
,
and
perhaps
the
clever
strategist
in
all
Europe
.
<EOS>
often
during
the
campaign
he
have
astonish
his
aide
-
de
-
camp
by
his
untire
energy
,
for
sometimes
he
would
even
visit
the
outpost
in
person
.
<EOS>
on
many
occasion
he
have
actually
creep
up
to
the
most
advanced
post
at
great
personal
risk
to
himself
,
so
anxious
have
he
be
to
see
with
his
own
eye
.
<EOS>
such
visit
from
the
Field
Marshal
himself
be
not
always
welcome
to
the
german
outpost
,
who
,
as
soon
as
they
show
the
least
sign
of
commotion
consequent
upon
the
visit
,
be
at
once
sweep
by
a
wither
english
fire
.
 
<EOS>
yet
he
now
stand
there
the
conqueror
.
<EOS>
and
while
many
of
his
officer
be
instal
themselves
in
comfortable
quarter
in
house
about
North
End
,
North
Hill
,
South
Hill
,
Muswell
Hill
,
Roslyn
Hill
,
Fitzjohn
's
Avenue
,
Netherhall
,
and
Maresfield
Gardens
,
and
other
road
in
that
vicinity
,
the
great
Commander
be
still
alone
upon
the
Heath
,
have
take
nothing
save
a
nip
from
his
flask
since
his
coffee
at
dawn
.
 
<EOS>
time
after
time
telegraphic
despatch
be
hand
to
him
from
Germany
,
and
telephonic
report
from
his
various
position
around
London
,
but
he
receive
them
all
without
comment
.
<EOS>
He
read
,
he
listen
,
but
he
say
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
full
hour
he
remain
there
,
stroll
up
and
down
alone
in
quick
impatience
.
<EOS>
then
,
as
though
suddenly
make
up
his
mind
,
he
call
three
member
of
his
staff
,
and
give
order
for
an
entry
into
London
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
as
he
know
,
be
the
signal
for
a
terrible
and
bloody
encounter
.
<EOS>
bugle
sound
.
<EOS>
man
and
officer
,
who
have
believe
that
the
storm
and
stress
of
the
day
be
over
,
and
that
they
be
entitle
to
rest
,
find
themselves
call
upon
to
fight
their
way
into
the
city
that
they
know
would
be
defend
by
an
irate
and
antagonistic
populace
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
the
order
have
be
give
,
and
it
must
be
obey
.
<EOS>
They
have
expect
that
the
advance
would
be
at
least
make
at
dawn
,
but
evidently
Von
Kronhelm
fear
that
six
hour
'
delay
may
necessitate
more
desperate
fighting
.
<EOS>
He
intend
,
now
that
London
be
cow
,
that
she
should
be
entirely
crush
.
<EOS>
the
order
of
his
master
the
Kaiser
be
to
that
effect
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
shortly
before
nine
o'clock
the
first
detachment
of
german
infantry
march
along
Spaniards
Road
,
and
down
Roslyn
Hill
to
Haverstock

where
they
be

behind
the
_
debris

of
the
great
barricade
across
the
junction
of

<EOS>
this

and
also
by
hundred

<EOS>
twenty
Germans

at
the
first
volley
,
and
next
instant
a
Maxim
,
conceal
in
the
first
floor
of
a
neighbouring
house
,
spit
forth
its
fire
upon
the
invader
with
deadly
effect
.
<EOS>
the
german
bugle

the
"
Advance

and
the

emulously
run

loud

<EOS>
five
minute
later
the
street
be
run
with
blood
,
for
hundred
,
both
Germans
and
british
,
lie
dead
and
die
.
<EOS>
every
Londoner
struggle
valiantly
until
shoot
down
;
yet
the
enemy
,
always
reinforce
,
press
forward
,
until
ten
minute
later
,
the
defender

,
and
the
house
from
which
the
Maxim
be

forth
its
deadly
hail
have

and
the

.
<EOS>
Volley
after
volley
be
still
,
however
,
pour
out
on
the
head
of
the
storm
party
,
but
already
the
pioneer
be
at
work
clear
a
way
for
the
advance
,
and
very
soon
the
Germans
have
surmount
the
obstruction
and
be
within
London
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
short
time
the
Germans
halt
,
then
,
at
a
signal
from
their
officer
,
they
move
along
both
road
,
again
be
fire
upon
from
every
house
in
the
vicinity
,
many
of
the
defender
have
retire
to
continue
their
defence
from
the
window
.
<EOS>
the
enemy
therefore
turn
their
attention
to
these
house
,
and
after
desperate
struggle
house
after
house
be
take
,
those
of
the
defender
not
wear
uniform
be
shoot
down
without
mercy
.
<EOS>
to
such
no
quarter
be
give
.
 
<EOS>
the
contest
now
become
a
most
furious
one
.
<EOS>
briton
and
Germans
fight
hand
to
hand
.
<EOS>
a
battalion
of
the
Brunswick
Infantry
with
some
rifleman
of
the
Guard
take
several
house
by
rush
in
Chalk
Farm
Road
;
but
in
many
case
the
Germans
be
shoot
by
their
own
comrade
.
<EOS>
quite
a
number
of
the
enemy
's
officer
be
pick
off
by
the
Frontiersmen
,
those
brave
fellow
who
have
see
service
in
every
corner
of
the
world
,
and
who
be
now
in
the
window
and
upon
roof
.
<EOS>
thus
the
furious
fight
from
house
to
house
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
this
exciting
conflict
be
practically
characteristic
of
what
be
at
that
moment
happen
in
fifty
other
spot
along
the
suburb
of
North
London
.
<EOS>
the
obstinate
resistance
which
we
make
against
the
Germans
be
meet
with
equally
obstinate
aggression
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
surrender
.
<EOS>
londoner
fall
and
die
fighting
to
the
very
last
.
 
<EOS>
against
those
well

train
Teutons
in
such
overwhelming
masse
we
,
however
,
could
have
no
hope
of
success
.
<EOS>
the
rush
of
the
infantry
and
rifle
of
the
Guards
be
make
skilfully
,
and
slowly
but
surely
break
down
all
opposition
.
 
<EOS>
the
barricade
in
the
Kentish
Town
Road
be
defend
with
valiant
heroism
.
<EOS>
the
Germans
be
,
as
in
Chalk
Farm
Road
,
compel
to
fight
their
way
foot
by
foot
,
lose
heavily
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
but
here
,
at
length
,
as
at
other
point
,
the
barricade
be
take
,
and
the
defender
chase
,
and
either
take
prisoner
or
else
ruthlessly
shoot
down
.
<EOS>
a
body
of
citizen
arm
with
rifle
be
,
after
the
storming
of
the
barricade
in
question
,
drive
back
into
Park

,
and
there
,
be
catch
between
two
body
of
Germans
,
slaughter
to
a
man

<EOS>
through
those
unlit
side
street
between
the
Kentish
Town
and
Camden
Roads
--
namely
,
the
Lawford
,
Bartholomew
,
Rochester
,
Caversham
,
and
Leighton
Roads
--
there
be
much
skirmishing
,
and
many
on
both
side
fall
in
the
bloody
encounter
.
<EOS>
a
thousand
deed
of
bravery
be
do
that
night
,
but
be
unrecorde
.
<EOS>
before
the
barricade
in
Holloway
Road
--
which
have
be
strongly
repair
after
the
breach
make
in
it
by
the
german
shell
--
the
enemy
lose
very
heavily
,
for
the
three
Maxims
which
have
there
be

do
awful
execution
.
<EOS>
the
invader
,
however
,
see
the
strong
defence
,
fall
back
for
full
twenty
minute
,
and
then
,
make
another
rush
,
hurl
petrol
bomb
into
the
midst
of
our
man
.
 
<EOS>
a
frightful
holocaust
be
the
result
.
<EOS>
fully
a
hundred
of
the
poor
fellow
be
literally
burn
alive
;
while
the
neighbouring
house
,
be
set
in
flame
,
compel
the
citizen
free
-
shooter
to
quickly
evacuate
their
position
.
<EOS>
against
such
terrible
missile
even
the
best
train
troop
can
not
stand
,
therefore
no
wonder
that
all
opposition
at
that
point
be
soon
afterwards
sweep
away
,
and
the
pioneer
quickly
open
the
road
for
the
victorious
legion
of
the
Kaiser
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
in
that
prosaic
thoroughfare
,
the
Holloway
Road
,
brave
man
fight
gallantly
and
die
,
while
a
Scotch
piper
pace
the
pavement
sharply
,
backwards
and
forwards
,
with
his
colour
fly
.
<EOS>
then
,
alas
!
come
the
red
flash
,
the
loud
explosion
in
rapid
succession
,
and
the
next
instant
the
whole
street

into
a
veritable
sea
of
flame
.
 
<EOS>
High
Street
,
Kingsland
,
be
also
the
scene
of
several
fierce
conflict
;
but
here
the
Germans
decidedly
get
the
bad
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
whole
infuriate
population
seem
to
emerge
suddenly
from
the
side
street
of
the
Kingsland
Road
on
the
appearance
of
the
detachment
of
the
enemy
,
and
the
latter
be
practically
overwhelmed
,
notwithstanding
the
desperate
fight
they
make
.
<EOS>
then
ring

go
up
from
the
defender

<EOS>
the
Germans
be
give
no

<EOS>
many
of
the
Germans
flee
through
the
side
street
towards
Mare
Street
,
and
be
hotly
pursue
,
the
majority
of
them
be

<EOS>
the
street
in

at

the

that
the
strength

be
far
great

any

be
futile
,
and
the

who
have
dare

fire
upon

have
in
every
case
be
shoot
down
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
when

Von

,
from

be
able

that
not

have
he
occupy
London

but
that
,
receive
no
reply

,
he
have
sack

take

<EOS>
that

the
evening
paper
describe
the
wild
happening
of
the
afternoon
,
and
London
see
herself
not
only
shatter
,
but
ruin
.
<EOS>
the
frightened
populace
across
the
river
stand
breathless
.
<EOS>
what
be
now
to
happen
?
 
<EOS>
though
London
lie
crush
and
occupy
by
the
enemy
,
though
the
Lord
Mayor
be
a
prisoner
of
war
and
the
bank
in
the
hand
of
the
Germans
,
though
the
metropolis
have
be
wreck
and
more
than
half
its
inhabitant
have
flee
southward
and
westward
into
the
country
,
yet
the

receive
no
reply
to
their
demand
for
an
indemnity

the
cession
of

<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
,
ignorant
of
what
have
occur
in
the
House
of
Commons
at
Bristol
,
sit
in
Whitehall
and
wonder
.
<EOS>
He
know
well
that
the
English
be
no
fool
,
and
their
silence
,
therefore
,
cause
him
considerable
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
He
have
lose
in
the
various
engagement
over
50,000
man
,
yet
nearly
200,000
still
remain
.
<EOS>
His
army
of
invasion
be
a
no
mean
responsibility
,
especially
when
at
any
moment
the
British
may
regain
command
of
the
sea
.
<EOS>
His
supply
and
reinforcement
would
then
be
at
once
cut
off
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
him
to
live
upon
the
country
,
and
his
food
basis
in
Suffolk
and
Essex
be
not
sufficiently
extensive
to
enable
him
to
make
a
prolong
campaign
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
whole
scheme
of
operation
which
have
be
so
long
discuss
and
perfect
in

in
Berlin
be
more
of

he

the

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
indeed

Parliament
have
take
every
precaution
that

<EOS>
the
truth
,
however
,
may
be
briefly
relate
.
<EOS>
on
the
previous
day
the
House
have
meet
at
noon
in
the
Colston
Hall
--
a
memorable
sitting
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
the
Secretary
of
State
for
War
have
,
after
prayer
,
rise
in
the
hall
and
read
an
official
despatch
he
have
just

from
Lord
Byfield
,
give
the
news
of
the
last
stand
make
by
the
british

of
Enfield
,
and
the
utter
hopelessness
of
the
situation
.
<EOS>
It
be
receive
by
the
assemble
House
in
ominous
silence
.
 
<EOS>
during
the
past
week
through
that
great
hall
the
Minister
's
deep
voice
,
shake
by
emotion
,
have
be
daily
hear
as
he
be
compel
to
report
defeat
after
defeat
of
the
british
arm
.
<EOS>
both
side
of
the
House
have
,
after
the
first
few
day
,
be
force
to
recognise
Germany
's
superiority
in
number
,
in
training
,
in
organisation
--
in
fact
in
everything
appertain
to
military
power
.
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
's
strategy
have
be
perfect
.
<EOS>
He
know
more
of
Eastern
England
than
the
British
Commander
himself
,
and
his
marvellous
system
of
spy
and
advance
agent
--
Germans
who
have
live
for
year
in
England
--
have
assist
him
forward
,
until
he
have
now
occupy
London
,
the
city
declare
to
be
impregnable
.
 
<EOS>
through
the
whole
of
September
20
the
Minister
constantly
receive
despatch
from
the
British
Field
Marshal
and
from
London
itself
,
yet
each
telegram
communicate
to
the
House
seem
more
hopeless
than
its
predecessor
.
 
<EOS>
the
debate
,
however
,
proceed
through
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
the
Opposition
be
bitterly
attack
the
Government
and
the
Blue
Water
School
for
its
gross
negligence
in
the
past
,
and
demand
to
know
the
whereabouts
of
the
remnant
of
the
British
Navy
.
<EOS>
the
First
Lord
of
the
Admiralty
flatly
refuse
to
make
any
statement
.
<EOS>
the
whereabouts
of
our
Navy
at
that
moment
be
,
he
say
,
a
secret
,
which
must
,
at
all
hazard
,
be
withhold
from
our
enemy
.
<EOS>
the
Admiralty
be
not
asleep
,
as
the
country
believe
,
but
be
fully
alive
to
the
seriousness
of
the
crisis
.
<EOS>
He
urge
the
House
to
remain
patient
,
say
that
as
soon
as
he
dare
he
would
make
a
statement
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
greet
by
loud
jeer
from
the
Opposition
,
from
whose
bench
,
member
,
one
after
another
,
rise
,
and
,
use
hard
epithet
,
blame
the
Government
for
the
terrible
disaster
.
<EOS>
the
cutting
down
of
our
defence
,
the
meagre
naval
programme
,
the
discouragement
of
the
Volunteers
and
of
recruiting
,
and
the
disregard
of
Lord
Roberts
'
scheme
in
1906
for
universal
military
training
be
,
they
declare
,
responsible
for
what
have
occur
.
<EOS>
the
Government
have
be
culpably
negligent
,
and
Mr.
Haldane
's
scheme
have
be
all
insufficient
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
have
be
nothing
short
of
criminal
to
mislead
the
Empire
into
a
false
sense
of
security
which
do
not
exist
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
past
three
year
Germany
,
while
sap
our
industry
,
have
send
spy
into
our
midst
,
and
laugh
at
us
for
our
foolish
insular
superiority
.
<EOS>
She
have
turn
her
attention
from
France
to
ourselves
,
notwithstanding
the
_
entente
cordiale
_
.
<EOS>
She
remember
how
the
much
-
talk
-
of
Franco
-
Russian
alliance
have
fall
to
piece
,
and
rely
upon
a
similar
outcome
of
the
friendship
between
France
and
Great
Britain
.
 
<EOS>
the
aspect
of
the
House
,
too
,
be
strange
;
the
Speaker
in
his
robe
look
out
of

in
his
big
uncomfortable

,
and

sit
on
cane
-
bottom
chair
instead
of
their
comfortable
bench
at
Westminster
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
possible
the
usual
arrangement
of
the
House
be
adhere
to
,
except
that
the
Press
be
now
exclude

official
report
be
furnish
to
them
at
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
the
clerk
'
table
be
a
large
plain
one
of
stained
wood
,
but
upon
it
be
the
usual
array
of
despatch
,
while
the
Serjeant
-
at
-
Arms
,
in
his
picturesque
dress
,
be
still
one
of
the
most
prominent
figure
.
<EOS>
the
lack
of
committee
room
,
of
an
adequate
lobby
,
and
of
a
refreshment
department
cause
much
inconvenience
,
though
a
temporary
post
and
telegraph
office
have
be
establish
within
the
building
,
and
a
separate
line
connect
the
Prime
Minister
's
room
with
Downing
Street
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
Government
be
denounce
in
unmeasured
term
,
its
defence
be
equally
vigorous
.
<EOS>
thus
,
through
that
never
-
to
-
be
-
forget
afternoon
the
sit
continue
past
the
dinner
hour
on
to
late
in
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
time
after
time
the
despatch
from
London
be
place
in
the
hand
of
the
War
Minister
,
but
,
contrary
to
the
expectation
of
the
House
,
he
vouchsafe
no
further
statement
.
<EOS>
It
be
notice
that
just
before
ten
o'clock
he
consult
in
an
earnest
undertone
with
the
Prime
Minister
,
the
First
Lord
of
the
Admiralty
,
and
the
Home
Secretary
,
and
that
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
all
four
go
out
and
be
closet
in
one
of
the
small
room
with
other
member
of
the
Cabinet
for
nearly
half
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
Secretary
of
State
for
War
re
-
enter
the
House
and
resume
his
seat
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
minute
afterwards
Mr.
Thomas

,
member

and
a

who

<EOS>
"
I
would

"
he
say

whether
it

and
whether

"
 
<EOS>
the
question
produce
the
utmost
sensation
.
<EOS>
the
House
during
the
whole
afternoon
have
be
in
breathless
anxiety
as
to
what
be
actually
happen
in
London
;
but
the
Government
hold
the
telegraph
and
telephone
,
and
the
only
private
despatch
that
have
come
to
Bristol
be
the
two
receive
by
some
roundabout
route
know
only
to
the
ingenious
journalist
who
have
despatch
them
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
despatch
have
be
convey
the
great
portion
of
the
way
by
motor
-
car
.
 
<EOS>
a
complete
silence
fall

<EOS>
every
face
be
turn
towards
the
War
Minister
,
who
,
seat
with
outstretched

,
be
hold
a
fresh
despatch
he
have
just
receive
.
 
<EOS>
He
rise
,
and
,
in
his
deep
bass
voice
,
said:--
 
"
in
reply
to
the
honourable
member
for
South
-
East
Brixton
,
the
statement
he
make
appear
,
from
information
which
have
just
reach
me
,
to
be
correct
.
<EOS>
the
Germans
be
,
unfortunately
,
bombard
London
.
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
,
it
be
report
,
be
at
Hampstead
,
and
the
zone
of
the
enemy
's
artillery
reach
,
in
some
case
,
as
far
south
as
the
Thames
itself
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
as
the
honourable
member
assert
,
an
enormous
amount
of
damage
have
already
be
do
to
various
building
,
and
there
have
undoubtedly
be
great
loss
of
life
.
<EOS>
My
late
information
be
that
the
non
-
combatant
inhabitant
--
old
person
,
woman
,
and
child
--
be
in
flight
across
the
Thames
,
and
that
the
barricade
in
the
principal
road
lead
in
from
the
north
be
hold
strongly
by
the
armed
populace
,
drive
back
into
London
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
sit
down
without
further
word
.
 
<EOS>
a
tall
,
thin
,
white

moustached
man
rise
at
that
moment
from
the
opposition
side
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Farquhar
,
late

the
Royal
Marines
,
be
a
well

know
military
critic
,
and
represent
West
Bude
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
this
,
"
he
say
,
"
be
the
only
hope
of
England
!
<EOS>
the
defence
of
London
by
an
armed
mob
,
pit
against
the
most
perfectly
equip
and
armed
force
in
the
world
!
<EOS>
londoner
be
patriotic
,
I
grant
.
<EOS>
They
will
die
fight
for
their
home
,
as
every
Englishman
will
when
the
moment
come
;
yet
,
what
can
we
hope
,
when
patriotism
be
range
against
modern
military
science
?
<EOS>
there
surely
be
patriotism
in
the
savage
negro
race
of
Central
Africa
,
a
love
of
country
perhaps
as
deep
as
in
the
white
man
's
heart
;
yet
a
little
strategy
,
a
few
Maxims
,
and
all
defence
be
quickly
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
and
so
it
must
inevitably
be
with
London
.
<EOS>
I
contend
,
Mr.

"
he
go
on

advise
action
of

first

we
now
find
ourselves
conquer

<EOS>
It
only
remain
for
them
now
to
make
term
of
peace
as
honourable
to
themselves
as
the
unfortunate
circumstance
will
admit
.
<EOS>
let
the
country
itself
judge
their
action
in
the
light
of
event
of
to

day
,
and
let
the
blood
of
the
poor
murder
woman
and
child
of
London
be
upon
their
head
.
<EOS>
(
shame
.
)
<EOS>
to
resist
further
be
useless
.
<EOS>
Our
military
organisation
be
in
chaos
,
our
miserably
weak
army
be
defeat
and
in
flight
.
<EOS>
I
declare
to
this
House
that
we
should
sue
at
this
very
moment
for
peace
--
a
dishonourable
peace
though
it
be
;

the
bitter
truth
be

plain

England

the

<EOS>
the

a
victorious
one

and
it
be

when
,
of
a
sudden
,
there
be
a
dull
,
heavy
roar

<EOS>
the
exact
loss

it
be
estimate
that
over
400
man

perish

single
instant

those
who

the
sudden
dash

<EOS>
the
evident
intention

be
thus
see

General
Sir

Crystal
Palace
,
give

Lord

be
in
constant
communication

with
the
London
headquarters
at
the
Crystal

,
as
well
as
with
Hibbard
on

<EOS>
to
General
Bamford
at
Sydenham
come
constant
news
of
the
rapid
spread
of
the
national
movement
of
defiance
,
and
Lord
Byfield
,
as
be
afterwards
know
,
urge
the
London
commander
to
remain
patient
,
and
invite
no
attack
until
the

<EOS>
affair

the
british
Free

the
Saxons
.
 
<EOS>
very
soon
Von
Kronhelm
become
aware
of
Lord
Byfield
's
intention
,
but
his
weakness
be
apparent
when
he
make
no
counter
-
move
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
that
the
various
great
city
he
now
hold
require
all
his
attention
and
all
his
troop
.
<EOS>
from
Manchester
,
from
Birmingham
,
from
Leeds
,
Bradford
,
Sheffield
,
and
Hull
come
similar
reply

<EOS>
any
withdrawal
of
troop
from
either
city
would
be
the
signal
for
a
general
rise
of
the
inhabitant
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
have
gain
possession
,
he
could
only
now
sit
tight
and
watch
.
 
<EOS>
from
all
over
Middlesex
,
and
more
especially
from
the
London
area
,
come
sensational
report
of
the
drastic
measure
adopt
by
the
Germans
to
repress
any
sign
of
revolt
.
<EOS>
in
secret
,
the
agent
of
the
League
of

be
at
work
,
go
from
house
to

,
enrol
man
,
arrange
for
secret
meeting

place
,
and
explain
in
confidence
the
programme
as
put
forward
by
the
Bristol
committee
.
<EOS>
now
and
then
,
however
,
these
agent
be
betray
,
and
their
betrayal
be
in
every
case
follow
by
a
court
-
martial
at
Bow

,
death
outside
in
the
yard
of
the
police
station
,
and
the
publication
in
the

their
offence
,
and
the
hour
of
the
execution
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
undaunted
and
defiantly
,
the
giant
organisation
grow
as
no
other
society
have
ever
grow
,
and
its
agent
and
member
quickly
develop
into
fearless
patriot
.
<EOS>
It
be
report
that
the
saxon
be
face
Lord
Byfield
with
the
Thames
between
them
,
the
people
of
West
London
begin
in
frantic
haste
to
construct
barricade
.
<EOS>
the
building
of
obstruction
have
,
indeed
,
now
become
a
mania
north
of
the
river
as
well
as
south
.
<EOS>
the
people
,
fear
that
there
be
to
be
more
fighting
in
the
street
of
London
,
begin
to
build
huge
defence
all
across
West
London
.
<EOS>
the
chief
be
across
King

,
Hammersmith
,
where
it
join
Goldhawk
Road
,
across
the
junction
of
Goldhawk
and
Uxbridge
Roads
,
in
the
Harrow

where
it
join
Admiral

and
Willesden

close

<EOS>
all
the

and
Ladbroke
Grove

be
also
block
up

and
hundred

house
place
in
a
state
of
strong
defence
.
 
<EOS>
with
all
this
Von
Kronhelm
do
not
interfere
.
<EOS>
the
building
of
such
obstruction
act
as
a
safety
-
valve
to
the
excited
populace
,
therefore
he
rather
encourage
than
discountenance
it
.
<EOS>
the
barricade
may
,
he
think
,
be
of
service
to
his
army
if
Lord
Byfield
really
risk
an
attack
upon
London
from
that
direction
.
 
<EOS>
Crafty
and
cunne
though
he
be
,
he
be
entirely
unaware
that
those
barricade
be
be
construct
at
the
secret
order
of
the
League
of
Defenders
,
and
he
never
dream
that
they
have
actually
be
instigate
by
the
British
Commander

in

Chief
himself

<EOS>
thus
the

the

<EOS>
Dalston

Kingsland
,
Bethnal
Green
,
and
Shoreditch
be
notably
antagonistic
to
the
invader
,
and
several
sharp
encounter
have
take
place
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
those
district
be
discover
by
the
enemy
to
be
very
unsafe
.
 
<EOS>
the
conflict

westphalian
infantryman
who
chance
to
be

,
and
who
subsequently

and
kill
one
of
the
Englishmen
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
signal
for
a
local
uprising
.
<EOS>
the
alarm
give
,
hundred
of
man
and
woman
rush
from
their
house
,
many
of
them
arm
with
rifle
and
knife
,
and
,
take
cover
behind
the
ruin
barricade
,
open
fire
upon
a
body
of
fifty
Germans
,
who
very
quickly
run
up
.
<EOS>
the
fire
be
return
,
when
from
the
neighbouring
house
a
perfect
hail
of
lead
be
suddenly
rain
upon
the
Germans
,
who
be
then
force
to
retire
down
High
Street
towards
Liverpool
Street
Station
,
leave
many
dead
.
 
<EOS>
very
quickly
news
be
send
over
the
telephone
,
which
the
Germans
have
now
establish
in
many
quarter
of
London
,
and
large
reinforcement
be
soon
upon
the
scene
.
<EOS>
the
man
of
Shoreditch
have
,
however
,
obtain
two
Maxim
gun
,
which
have
be
secrete
ever
since
the
entry
of
the
Germans
into
the
Metropolis
,
and
as
the
enemy
endeavour
to
storm
their
position
they
sweep
the
street
with
a
deadly
fire
.
<EOS>
quickly
the
situation
become
desperate
,
but
the
fight
last
over
an
hour
.
<EOS>
the
sound
of
firing
bring
hundred
upon
hundred
of
Londoners
upon
the
scene
.
<EOS>
all
these
take
arm
against
the
Germans
,
who
,
after
many
fruitless
attempt
to
storm
the
defence
,
and
be
fire
upon
from
every
side
,
be
compel
to
fall
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
follow
along
High
Street
into
Bethnal
Green
Road
,
up
Great
Eastern
Street
into
Hoxton
Square
and
Pitfield
Street
,
and
there
cut
up
,
be
give
no
quarter
at
the
hand
of
the
furious
populace
.
<EOS>
in
those
narrow
thoroughfare
they
be
powerless
,
and
be
therefore
simply
exterminate
.
 
<EOS>
the
victory
for
the
man
of
Shoreditch
be
complete
,
over
three
hundred
and
fifty
Germans
be
kill
,
while
our
loss
be
only
about
fifty
.
 
<EOS>
the
conflict
be
at
once
report
to
Von
Kronhelm
,
and
the
very
fact
that
he
do
not
send
exemplary
punishment
into
that
quarter
be
sufficient
to
show
that
he
fear
to
arouse
further
the
hornet
'
nest
in
which
he
be
live
,
and
more
especially
that
portion
of
the
populace
north
of
the
City
.
 
<EOS>
News
of
the
attack
,
quickly
spread
,
inspired
courage
in
every
other
part
of
the
oppress
Metropolis
.
 
<EOS>
the
successful
uprising
against
the
Germans
in
Shoreditch
incite
Londoners
to
rebel
,
and
in
various
other
part
of
the
Metropolis
there
occur
outbreak
.
 
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
have
find
to
his
cost
that
London
be
not
to
be
so
easily
cow
after
all
.
<EOS>
the
size
and
population
of
the
Metropolis
have
not
be
sufficiently
calculate
upon
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
a
country
in
itself
,
while
the
intricacy
of
its
by

way
form
a
refuge
for
the
conspirator
,
who
be
gradually
complete
their
preparation
to
rise
_
en
masse
_
and
strike
down
the
Germans
wherever
find
.
<EOS>
in
the
open
country
his
great
army
could
march
,
manoeuvre
,
and
use
strategy
,
but
here
in
the
maze
of
narrow
London
street
it
be
impossible
to
know
in
one
thoroughfare
what
be
take
place
in
the
next
.
 
<EOS>
supply
,
too
,
be
now

very
short
.
<EOS>
the
distress
among
our
vanquished
populace
be
most
severe
;
while
Von
Kronhelm
's
own
army
be
put
on
meagre
ration
.
<EOS>
the
increase
price
of
food
and
consequent
starvation
have
not
serve
to
improve
the
relation
between
the
invader
and
the
citizen
of
London
,
who
,
though
they
be
assure
by
various
proclamation
that
they
would
be
happy
and
more
prosperous
under
german
rule
,
now
discover
that
they
be
be
slowly
starve
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
Their
only
hope
,
therefore
,
be
in
the
effort
of
that
now

,
the
League
of

<EOS>
another

then
it
be

<EOS>
the

but
a

moment
later

and
a

a

they
possess
a
superiority
over

at

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
have

Von

--
which

they

lesson

<EOS>
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
they
fear
that
such
revolt
may
be
repeat
in

quarter
.
 
<EOS>
so
they
seize
dozen
of

,
man
and

,
and
shoot
them
down
.
<EOS>
many
of
these
summary

enough
of

suffice
it
to
say
that

that

that

yet
the
two

three
local
rising
of
yesterday

the
day
previous
have
give
us
courage

they
show
that
the
enemy
can
not
manoeuvre
in
the
narrow
street
,

soon
become
demoralise

<EOS>
in
London
we
fail
because
we
have
so
few
rifleman

if
every

could
shoot

we

indeed

if
Lord
Roberts

there
be
another
conflict
this
morning

Corps

<EOS>
the
outbreak
commence
by
the
arrest

be
find
practise
with
rifle
in
Paddington
Recreation
Ground

<EOS>
one
man
who
resist
be
shoot
on
the
spot
,
whereupon
the
crowd
who
assemble
attack
the
german
picket
,
and
eventually
kill
them
to
a
man

<EOS>
this
be
the
signal
for
a
general
outbreak
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
half
an
hour
later
,
when
a
force
be
send
to
quell

fierce
fighting

here
the

from

apparent

purposely
order

cause

we
have
another
report
from
Dalston
,
a
third
from
Limehouse

a
fourth
from
Homerton

it

mount
several
field
gun

shell

have
usurp
the
apartment

have
already
be
half
reduce

<EOS>
this
action
be
,
no

only
to
harass

surely

no

vengeance
that
be
at

<EOS>
as
I

through

I
can
hear
the
roar

the
continual
crackling
of
rifle

the
heavy
booming
of
gun

<EOS>
I
walk
along
Fleet
Street
at
nine
o'clock

I
find
,
utterly

not

I
see
in
the
street

<EOS>
It
seem
as
though
,
for
the
moment
,
the
enemy
have
vanish
.
<EOS>
there
be
only
the
strong
cordon
across
the

without

be
it
possible
that
Von

strategy
be
to
remain
inactive
,

refuse
to
fight

<EOS>
"
the
first
shot
I
hear
fire
,
just
after
ten
o'clock
,
be
at
the
Strand
end
of
Fleet
Street
,
at
the
corner
of

Lane

,
I
afterwards
discover
,
a
party
of
forty
german
infantryman
have
be
attack
,
and
all
of
them
kill
.
<EOS>
quickly
follow
this
,
I
hear
the
distant
booming
of
artillery
,
and
then
the
rattle
of
musketry
and
pom

pom
become
general
,

not
in
the
neighbourhood

I
be

<EOS>
for
nearly
half
an
hour
I
remain
at

corner

,
on
go
farther
along

Strand

I
find
that
the
defender
from

Waterloo
Road
have
make
a
wild
sortie
into
the
Strand

could
find
no
Germans
there

"
the
man

at

thirteen
day

thirteen
day
of
semi
-
starvation
,
sleeplessness
,
and
constant
tension
,
for
we
know
not
,
from
one
moment
to
another
,
when
a
sudden
attack
may
be
make
upon
us

at
first
our
obstruction

ill

miscellaneous
article

half
of
which

on
the
third
day
our
man

by
several
non

begin
to
put
the
position
in
a
proper
state
of
defence

to
mount
Maxims
in
the
neighbouring
house
,
and
to
place
explosive
in
the
crown
of
two
of
the
arch
of
the
bridge

that
we
could
instantly
demolish
it
if
necessity
arise

"
fully
a
thousand
man
be
hold
the
position

unfortunately
few
of
them
have
ever
handle
a
rifle

<EOS>
as
regard
myself

I
have
learn
to
shoot
rook
when
a
boy
in
Shropshire
,
and
now
that
I
have
obtain
a
gun
I
be
anxious
to
try
my
skill
.
<EOS>
when
the
League
of
Defenders

,
and
a
local
secretary
come
to
us
,

then
come
a
period
--
long

dreary

shadeless
day
of
waiting

when
the
sun
beat
down
upon
us
mercilessly
and
our
vigilance
be
require
to
be
constant
both
night
and
day
.
<EOS>
so
uncertain
be
the
movement
of
the
enemy
opposite
us
that
we
scarcely
dare
to
leave
our
position
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
night
after
night
I
spend
sleep
in
a
neighbouring
doorway
,
with
an
occasional
stretch
upon
somebody
's
bed
in
some
house
in
the
vicinity

<EOS>
now
and
then
,
whenever
we
see
Germans
move
in
Wellington
Street

we
send
a
volley
into
them

in
return

sharp
reply
from

pom

pom

sentry

on

in

riverside
warehouse

watch
for
the
approach
of
the
enemy

<EOS>
almost
nightly
some
adventurous
spirit
among
the
Germans
would
try
and
cross
.
<EOS>
on
one
occasion
,

do
sentry
duty
in

It
be
about
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
as
we
sit
smoke
our
pipe
,
with
our
eye
fix
upon
the
glitter
water

we
suddenly
see
a
small
boat
contain
three

slowly
along

for
a
moment

at
first

cry
to
my
comrade

with
one

Ere
the
echo
of
the
first
shot

die
away

man
fall
into

at

next
shot

knowledge

we
be
about

strike

blow
inspire
me
with
fresh
life

strength

Our
officer
shout
a
brief
word
of
command

next
moment
we
open
a
withering
fire
upon
the
enemy

barricade
in
Wellington
Street

in
a
moment
a
hundred
rifle

several
Maxims
spat
their
red
fire
at
us

usual

bullet

themselves
harmlessly

Sir
Francis

three

crackling

all
resistance

first

be
surprised

this

on
further
scrutiny
we
find

fire

have
route

after
a
bloody

successful
combat
last
from
early
dawn
till
late
in
the
afternoon
,
the
country
to
the
immediate
west
of
the
metropolis
have
be
sweep
clear
of
the
hate
invader

and
the
masse
of
the

League

can
be
pour
into
the
West
of
London
without
let
or

<EOS>
in
the
desperate
street
fighting
which
be
now
go
on
they
will
be
much
more
formidable
than
they
be
ever
likely
to
be
in
the
open
field
,
where
they
be
absolutely
incapable
of
manoeuvring
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
saxon
--
what

leave
of
them
--
and
Froelich

Cavalry
Division

with

we

they
have
now
fall
back
on
Harrow

Hendon

it
be
say
;
but
it
be
currently
report
that
a
constant
movement
towards
the
high
ground
near
Hampstead
be
go
on
.
<EOS>
these
rumour
come
by
way
of
London
,
since
the
enemy
's
enormous
force
of
cavalry
be
still
strong
enough
to
prevent
us
get
any
first
-
hand
intelligence
of
his
movement
.
 
<EOS>
"
as
have
be
previously
report
,
the
XIIth
Saxon
Corps
,
under
the
command
of
Prince
Henry
of
Wuertemberg
,
have
take
up
a
position
intend
to
cover
the
metropolis
from
the
horde
of
'
Defenders
'
which
,
support
by
a
small
leaven
of
Regulars
,
with
a
proportion
of
cavalry
and
gun
,
be
know
to
be
slowly
roll
up
from
the
west
and
south
.
<EOS>
Their
front
,
face
west
,
extend
from
staine
on
the
south
,
to
Pinner
on
the
north
,
pass
through
Stanwell
,
West
Drayton
,
and
Uxbridge
.
<EOS>
in
addition
they
have
a
strong
reserve
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Hounslow
,
whose
business
it
be
to
cover
their
left
flank
by
keep
watch
along
the
line
of
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
They
have
destroy
all
bridge
over
the
river
between
Staines
and
Hammersmith
.
<EOS>
Putney
Bridge
,
however
,
be
still
intact
,
as
all
attack
on
it
have
be
repulse
by
the
british
hold
it
on
the
south
side
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
general
state
of
affair
<EOS>
when
Lord
Byfield
,
who
have
establish
his
headquarters
at
Windsor
,
form
his
plan
of
attack
.
 
<EOS>
"
as
far
as
I
have
be
able
to
ascertain
,
its
general
idea
be
to
hold
the
saxon
to
their
position
by
the
threat
of
300,000
defender
that
be
assemble
and
be
continually
increase
along
a
roughly
parallel
line
to
that
occupy
by
the
enemy
at
about
ten
mile
'
distance
from
it
,
while
he
attack
their
left
flank
with
what
Regular
and
Militia
regiment
he
could
rapidly
get
together
near
Esher
and
Kingston
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
the
southern
line
in
the
neighbourhood
of
London
be
all
in
work
order
,
the
damage
that
have
be
do
here
and
there
by
small
party
of
the
enemy
who
have
make
raid
across
the
river
have
be
repair
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
therefore
,
not
a
very
difficult
matter
to
assemble
troop
from
Windsor
and
various
point
on
the
South
of
London
at
very
short
notice
.
 
<EOS>
"
General
Bamford
,
to
whom
have
be
entrust
the
defence
of
South
London
,
and
who
have
establish
his
headquarters
at
the
Crystal
Palace
,
also
contribute
every
man
he
could
spare
from
the
remnant
of
the
regular
troop
under
his
command
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
consider
quite
safe
now
that
the
Germans
in
the
City
be
so
hardly
press
to
leave
the
defence
of
the
Thames
bridge
to
the
masse
of
Irregulars
who
have
all
along
form
the
bulk
of
their
defender

<EOS>
the
risk
that
Prince
Henry
of
Wuertemberg
would
take
the
bull
by
the
horn
,
and
by
a
sudden
forward
move
attack
and
scatter
the
inert
and
invertebrate
mass
of
'
defender
'
who
be
in
his
immediate
front
have
,
of
course
,
to
be
take
;
but
it
be
consider
that
in
the
present
state
of
affair
in
London
he
would
hardly
dare
to
increase
the
distance
between
the
Saxon
Corps
and
the
rest
of
the
german
Army
.
<EOS>
event
prove
the
correctness
of
this
surmise
;
but
owe
to
unforeseen
circumstance
,
the
course
of
the
battle
be
somewhat
different
from
that
which
have
be
anticipate
.
 
<EOS>
"
despite
the
vigilance
of
the
german
spy
our
plan
be
keep
secret
till
the
very
end
,
and
it
be
believe
that
the
great
convergence
of
regular
troop
that
begin
as
soon
as
it
be
dark
from
Windsor
and
from
along
the
line
occupy
by
the
Army
of
the
League
on
the
west
,
right
round
to
Greenwich
on
the
east
,
go
on
without
any
news
of
the
movement
be
carry
to
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
"
before
dawn
this
morning
every
unit
be
in
the
position
to
which
it
have
be
previously
detail
,
and
,
everything
be
in
readiness
,
the
Royal
Engineers
begin
to
throw
a
pontoon
bridge
over
the
Thames
at
the
point
where
it
make
a
bend
to
the
south
just
above
the
site
of
Walton
Bridge
.
<EOS>
the
enemy
's
patrol
and
picket
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
at
once
open
a
heavy
fire
on
the
worker
,
but
it
be
beat
down
by
that
which
be
pour
upon
them
from
the
house
in
Walton
-
on
-
Thames
,
which
have
be
quietly
occupy
during
the
night
.
<EOS>
the
enemy
in
vain
try
to
reinforce
them
,
but
in
order
to
do
this
their
troop
have
to
advance
into
a
narrow
peninsula
which
be
sweep
by
a
cross
-
fire
of
shell
from
battery
which
have
be
place
in
position
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
for
this
very
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
"
by
seven
o'clock
the
bridge
be
complete
,
and
the
troop
be
begin
to
cross
over
cover
by
the
fire
of
the
artillery
and
by
an
advance
guard
which
have
be
push
over
in
boat
.
<EOS>
simultaneously
very
much
the
same
thing
have
be
go
on
at
Long
Ditton
,
and
fierce
fighting
be
go
on
in
the
avenue
and
gardens
<EOS>
round
Hampton
Court
.
<EOS>
success
here
,
too
,
attend
the
british
arm
.
<EOS>
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
a
determined
attempt
to
cross
the
river
in
force
have
not
at
all
be
anticipate
by
the
Germans
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
credit
their
opponent
with
the
power
of
so
rapidly
assemble
an
army
and
assume
an
effective
and
vigorous
offensive
so
soon
after
their
terrible
series
of
disaster
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
they
have
probably
look
for
be
an
attempt
to
overwhelm
them
by
sheer
force
of
number
.
<EOS>
They
doubtless
calculate
that
Lord
Byfield
would
stiffen
his
flabby
masse
of
'
defender
'
with
what
train
troop
he
could
muster
,
and
endeavour
to
attack
their
line
along
their
whole
length
,
overlap
them
on
the
flank
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
realise
that
to
do
this
he
would
have
to
sacrifice
his
man
in
thousand
upon
thousand
,
but
they
know
that
to
do
so
would
be
his
only
possible
chance
of
success
in
this
eventuality
,
since
the
bulk
of
his
man
could
neither
manoeuvre
nor
deploy
.
<EOS>
still
they
reckon
that
in
the
desperate
situation
of
the
british
,
he
would
make
up
his
mind
to
do
this
.
 
<EOS>
"
on
their
part
,
although
they
fully
realise
the
possibility
of
be
overwhelm
by
such
tactic
,
they
feel
pretty
confident
that
,
post
as
they
be
behind
a
perfect
network
of
small
river
and
stream
which
run
down
to
join
the
Thames
,
they
would
at
least
succeed
in
beat
off
the
attack
with
heavy
loss
,
and
stand
no
bad
chance
of
turn
the
repulse
into
a
rout
by
skilful
use
of
Froelich
's
Cavalry
Division
,
which
would
be
irresistible
when
attack
totally
untrained
troop
after
they
have
be
shatter
and
disorganise
by
artillery
fire
.
<EOS>
this
,
at
least
,
be
the
view
of
those
expert
with
whom
I
have
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
,
perhaps
,
tend
rather
to
confirm
them
in
their
theory
as
to
the
action
of
the
British
be
the
rifle
firing
that
go
on
along
the
whole
of
their
front
all
night
through
.
<EOS>
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
various
unit
which
conglomerate
together
form
the
force
face
the
Saxons
,
have
pick
out
the
few
man
under
their
command
who
really
have
some
little
idea
of
use
a
rifle
,
and
,
supply
with
plenty
of
ammunition
,
have
send
them
forward
in
numerous
small
party
with
general
order
to
approach
as
near
the
enemy
's
picket
line
as
possible
,
and
as
soon
as
fire
on
to
lie
down
and
open
fire
in
return
.
<EOS>
so
a
species
of
snipe
engagement
go
on
from
dark
to
dawn
.
<EOS>
several
party
get
capture
or
cut
up
by
the
german
outlying
troop
and
many
other
get
shoot
by
neighbour
party
of
sniper
.
<EOS>
but
,
although
they
do
not
in
all
probability
do
the
enemy
much
damage
,
yet
they
keep
them
on
the
alert
all
night
,
and
lead
them
to
expect
an
attack
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
one
way
and
another
luck
be
entirely
on
the
side
of
the
patriot
that
morning
.
 
<EOS>
"
when
daylight
come
the
British
mass
to
the
westward
of
Staines
<EOS>
have
such
a
threatening
appearance
from
their
immense
number
,
and
their
fire
from
their
battery
of
heavy
gun
and
howitzer
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
,
which
take
the
german
left
flank
in
,
be
so
heavy
that
Prince
Henry
,
who
be
there
in
person
,
judge
an
attack
to
be
imminent
,
and
would
not
spare
a
man
to
reinforce
his
troop
at
Shepperton
and
Halliford
,
who
be
,
numerically
,
totally
inadequate
to
resist
the
advance
of
the
british
once
they
get
across
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
the
most
imploring
request
for
assistance
,
but
order
the
officer
in
command
at
Hounslow
to
move
down
at
once
and
drive
the
British
into
the
river
.
<EOS>
so
it
have
be
report
by
our
prisoner

<EOS>
unluckily
for
him
this
officer
have
his
hand
quite
full
enough
at
this
time

for
the
british
,
who
have
cross
at
Long

have
now
make
themselves
master
of
everything
east
of
the
Thames

to
what
we
learn
subsequently
from

,
they
be
command
by
Prince
Henry
of
Wuertemberg
in
person

<EOS>
He
have
quit
his
position
at
Staines
,
leave
only
a
single
battalion
and
a
few
gun
as
a
rearguard
to
oppose
the
masse
of
the
'

who
threaten
him
in

have
place
his

in

good
position

could
to
cover
the
retreat
of
the
rest
of
his

from

they
have
be
occupy

<EOS>
He
have
,
it
would
appear
,
soon
after
the
fighting
begin
,
receive
the
most
urgent
order
from
Von
Kronhelm
to
fall
back
on
London
and
assist
him
in
the
street
fighting
that
have
now
be
go
on
without
intermission
for
the
good
part
of
two
day

Von
Kronhelm
probably
think
that
he
would
be
able
to
draw
off
some
of
his
numerous
foe
to
the
westward
.
<EOS>
but
the
message
be
receive
too
late

<EOS>
Prince
Henry
do
his
good
to
obey
it

by
this
time
the
very

Corps
be
at
stake
on

of
the
totally
unexpected
attack
on
his
left
rear
by
the
british
regular
troop
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
oppose
such
a
stout
resistance
with
the
troop
under
his
immediate
command
that
he
bring
the
british
advance
to
a
temporary
standstill
,
while
in
his
rear
every
road
lead
Londonward
be
crowd
with
the

they

as
it
be
the
undisciplined

untrained

of
the

lose
a
long
time
in

over

They
lose
heavily

too
,
from
the
fire
of
the
small
rearguard
that
have
be
leave
at
the
most
likely

<EOS>
the
Saxons
be
therefore
able
to
get
quite
well
away
from

when

without

before

the

be
upon

It
be
a
perfect

Prince
Henry
,
by
desperate
effort

contrive
to
hold
on
long

in

enable

fire
at
a
range

the

the

have
to
extend

fall
back
for
some
distance
in

northerly
direction

<EOS>
near
eale
they
meet
the
Uxbridge

a
certain
delay

confusion
occur
.
<EOS>
however

before

<EOS>
"
during
all
this
time
the
rattle
of
rifle
fire
wax
heavier
and
heavier

<EOS>
It
soon
become
apparent
that
every
road
and
street
lead
into
London
be
barricade
and
that
the
house
on

side
be
cram
with
rifleman

<EOS>
before

action
could
be

the
retire
Saxons
find
themselves
commit
to
a
very
nasty
bout
of
street
fighting
.
<EOS>
Their
gun
be
almost
useless
,
since
they
could
not
be
place
in
position
from
which
they
could
fire
on
the
barricade
except
so
close
as
to
be
under

rifle
fire

<EOS>
They
make
several
desperate
assault
,
most
of
which
be
repulse

<EOS>
in
Goldhawk
Road
a
Jaegar
battalion
contrive
to
rush
a
big
rampart
of
paving
-
stone
which
have
be
improvise
by
the
British
;
but
,
once
over
,
they
be
decimate
by
the
fire
from
the
house
on
either
side
of
the
street
.
<EOS>
big
high
explosive
shell
from
Richmond
Hill
,
too
,
begin
to
drop
among
the
Saxons
.
<EOS>
though
the
range
be
long
,
the
gunner
be
evidently
well
inform
of
the
whereabouts
of
the
Saxon
troop
and
make
wonderfully
lucky
shooting
.
 
<EOS>
"
for
some
time
the
distant
rumble
of
the
firing
to
the
south
-
west
have
be
grow
more
distinct
in
their
ear
,
and
about
four
o'clock
<EOS>
it
suddenly
break
out
comparatively
near
by
.
<EOS>
then
come
an
order
from
Prince
Henry
to
fall
back
on
ealing
at
once
.
<EOS>
what
have
happen
?
<EOS>
It
will
not
take
long
to
relate
this
.
<EOS>
Prince
Henry

position
have
lain
roughly
between
East
Bedfont
and
Hounslow
,
face
south
-
east
.
<EOS>
He
have
contrive
to
hold
on
to
the
latter
place
long
enough
to
allow
his
right
to
pivot
on
it
and
fall
back
to
Cranford
Bridge
.
<EOS>
here
they
be
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
relieve
from
the
close
pressure
they
have
be
subject
to
by
the
constantly
advance
british
troop
,
by
the
able
and
determined
action
of
Froelich
's
Cavalry
Brigade
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
in
the
meantime
his
enemy
on
the
left
,
constantly
reinforce
from
across
the
river
--
while
never
desist
from
their
so
far
unsuccessful
attack
on
Hounslow
--
work
round
through
Twickenham
and
Isleworth
till
they
begin
to
menace
his
rear
.
<EOS>
He
must
abandon
Hounslow
,
or
be
cut
off
.
<EOS>
with
consummate
generalship
he
withdraw
his
left
along
the
line
of
the
Metropolitan
and
District
Railway
,
and
send
word
to
the
troop
on
his
right
to
retire
and
take
up
a
second
position
at
Southall
Green
.
<EOS>
unluckily
for
him
,
there
be
a
delay
in
transmission
,
result
in
a
considerable
number
of
these
troop
be
cut
off
and
capture
.
<EOS>
Froelich
's
cavalry
be
unable
to
aid
them
at
this
juncture
,
have
their
attention
draw
away
by
the
masse
of
'
Leaguers
'
who
have
manage
to
get
over
the
Colne
and
be
congregate
near
Harmondsworth
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
cut
these
up
and
disperse
them
,
but
afterwards
find
that
they
be
separate
from
the
Saxons
by
a
strong
force
of
british
regular
troop
who
occupy
Harlington
and
open
a
fire
on
the
Reiters
that
empty
numerous
saddle
.
<EOS>
They
,
therefore
,
make
off
to
the
northward
.
<EOS>
from
this
forward
nothing
could
check
the
steady
advance
of
the
English
,
though
fierce
fighting
go
on
till
dark
all
through
Hanwell
,
ealing
,
Perivale
,
and
Wembley

the
saxon
struggle
gamely
to
the
last

get
more
and
more
disorganised
.

have
it
not
be
for
Froelich
's
division
on
their
right
they
would
have
be
surround
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
they
must
have
lose
half
their
strength
in
casualty
and
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
"
at
dark
,
however
,
Lord
Byfield
order
a
general
halt
of
his
tired
though
triumphant
troop
,
and
bivouac
and
billet
them
along
a
line

from
Willesden

right
through
Wembley
to
Greenford

He
establish
his
headquarters
at
Wembley

<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
some
critic
say
that
he
ought
to
have
push
on
his
fresh
troop
towards
Hendon
to
prevent
the
remnant
of
our
opponent
from
re

enter
London

but
other
,
with
reason

urge
that
he
be

let

into

how
the
WAR
ENDED

anxious
day
.
<EOS>
a
whole
month
go
by
.
<EOS>
what
have
really
happen
at
sea
be
unknown
.
<EOS>
after
the
truce
,
London
very
gradually
begin
to
resume
her
normal
life
,
though
the
gaunt
state
of
the
street
be
indescribably
weird
.
 
<EOS>
shop
begin
to
open
,
and
as
each
day
pass
,
food
become
more
plentiful
and
consequently
less
dear
.
<EOS>
the
truce
mean
the
end
of
the
war
,
therefore
thanksgiving
service
be
hold
in
every
town
and
village
throughout
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
great
prison
-
camp
of
Germans
at
Hounslow
,
Brentwood
,
and
Barnet
,
while
Von
Kronhelm
and
his
chief
officer
be
also
hold
as
prisoner
until
some
decision
through
diplomatic
channel
could
be
arrive
at
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
a
little
business
begin
to
be
do
;
thousand
begin
to
resume
their
employment
,
banker
reopen
their
door
,
and
within
a
week
the
distress
and
suffering
of
the
poor
become
perceptibly
alleviate
.
<EOS>
the
task
of
bury
the
dead
after
the
terrible
massacre
of
the
Germans
in
the
London
street
have
be
a
stupendous
one
,
but
so
quickly
have
it
be
accomplish
that
an
epidemic
be
happily
avert
.
 
<EOS>
Parliament
move
back
to
Westminster
,
and
daily
meeting
of
the
Cabinet
be
be
hold
in
Downing
Street
.
<EOS>
these
result
in
the
resignation
of
the
Ministry
,
and
with
a
fresh
Cabinet
,
in
which
Mr.
Gerald
Graham
,
the
organiser
of
the
Defenders
,
be
give
a
seat
,
a
settlement
be
at
last
arrive
at
.
 
<EOS>
to
further
describe
the
chaotic
state
of
England
occasion
by
the
terrible
and
bloody
war
would
serve
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
the
loss
and
suffering
which
it
have
cause
the
country
have
be
incalculable
;
statisticians
estimate
that
in
one
month
of
hostility
it
have
amount
to
L500,000,000
,
a
part
of
which
represent
money
transfer
from
british
pocket
to
German
,
as
the
enemy
have
carry
off
some
of
the
security
upon
which
the
german
troop
have
lay
their
hand
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
for
a
moment
take
a
retrospective
glance
.
<EOS>
consol

bread
be
still

<EOS>

;
and
the
ravage
of
the
german
commerce
-
destroyer
have
send
up
the
cost
of
insurance
on
british
shipping
sky
-
high
.
<EOS>
money
be
almost
unprocurable
;
except
for
the
manufacture
of
war
material
,
there
be
no
industry
;
and
the
suffering
and
distress
among
the
poor
could
not
be
exaggerate
.
<EOS>
in
all
direction
man
,
woman
,
and
child
have
be
starve
.
 
<EOS>
the
mercantile
community
be
loud
in
their
outcry
for
"
peace
at
any
price
,
"
and
the
pro
-
german
and
stop
-
the
-
War
Party
be
equally
vehement
in
demand
a
cessation
of
the
war
.
<EOS>
They
find
excuse
for
the
enemy
,
and
forget
the
frightful
devastation
and
loss
which
the
invasion
have
cause
to
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
They
insist
that
the
work
class
gain
nothing
,
even
though
the
british
fleet
be
closely
blockade
the
german
coast
,
and
their
outcry
be
strengthen
when
a
few
day
after
the
blockade
of
the
Elbe
have
begin
,
two
british
battleship
be
so
unfortunate
as
to
strike
german
mine
,
and
sink
with
a
large
part
of
their
crew
.
<EOS>
the
difficulty
of
borrow
money
for
the
prosecution
of
the
war
be
a
grave
obstacle
in
the
way
of
the
party
of
action
,
and
prey
upon
the
mind
of
the
British
Government
.
 
<EOS>
Socialism
,
with
its
creed
of
"
Thou
shalt
have
no
other

but
Thyself
,
"
and
its
doctrine
,
"
let
us
eat
and
drink
,
for
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
we
die
,
"
have
replace
the
religious
belief
of
a
generation
of
Englishmen
teach
to
suffer
and
to
die
soon
than
surrender
to
wrong
.
<EOS>
in
the
hour
of
trial
,
amidst
smoking
ruin
,
among
the
holocaust
of
dead
which
mark
the
prolonged
,
bloody
,
and
terrible
battle
on
land
and
at
sea
,
the
spirit
of
the
nation
quail
,
and
there
be
really
no
great
leader
to
recall
it
to
way
of
honour
and
duty
.
 
<EOS>
the
wholesale
destruction
of
food
,
and
particularly
of
wheat
and
meat
,
remove
from
the
world
's
market
a
large
part
of
its
supply
,
and
have
immediately
send
up
the
cost
of
food
everywhere
,
outside
the
United
Kingdom
as
well
as
in
it
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
the
attack
upon
ship
laden
with
food
increase
the
cost
of
insurance
to
prohibitive
price
upon
vessel
freight
for
the
United
Kingdom
.
<EOS>
the
underwriter
after
the
first
few
capture
by
the
enemy
would
not
insure
at
all
except
for
fabulous
rate
.
 
<EOS>
the
withdrawal
of
all
the
large
british
cruiser
for
the
purpose
of
defeat
the
main
german
fleet
in
the
North
Sea
leave
the
commerce
-
destroyer
a
free
hand
,
and
there
be
no
force
to
meet
them
.
<EOS>
the
british
liner
commission
as
commerce
-
protector
be
too
few
and
too
slow
to
be
able
to
hold
their
adversary
in
check
.
 
<EOS>
neutral
shipping
be
molest
by
the
german
cruiser
.
 
<EOS>
whenever
raw
cotton
or
food
of
any
kind
be
discover
upon
a
neutral
vessel
bind
for
british
port
,
the
vessel
be
seize
and
send
into
one
or
other
of
the
german
harbour
on
the
West
Coast
of
Africa
.
 
<EOS>
the
United
Kingdom
,
indeed
,
may
have
be
reduce
to
absolute
starvation
<EOS>
have
it
not
be
for
the
fact
that
the
canadian
Government
interfere
in
Canada
to
prevent
similar
german
tactic
from
succeed
,
and
hold
the
german
contract
for
the
cornering
of
canadian
wheat
,
contrary
to
public
policy
.
 
<EOS>
the
want
of
food
,
the
high
price
of
bread
and
meat
in
England
,
and
the
greatly
increased
cost
of
the
supply
of
raw
material
send
up
the
expenditure
upon
poor
relief
to
enormous
figure
.
<EOS>
million
of
man
be
out
of
employment
,
and
in
need
of
assistance
.
<EOS>
mill
and
factory
in
all
direction
have
close
down
,
either
because
of
the
military
danger
from
the
operation
of
the
german
army
,
or
because
of
the
want
of
order
,
or
,
again
,
because
raw
material
be
not
procurable
.
 
<EOS>
unfortunately
,
when
the
invasion
begin
,
many
rich
foreigner
who
have
live
in
England
collect
what
portable
property
they
possess
and
retire
abroad
to
Switzerland
,
Italy
,
and
the
United
States
.
<EOS>
Their
example
be
follow
by
large
number
of
british
subject
who
have
invest
abroad
,
and
now
,
in
the
hour
of
distress
,
be
able
to
place
their
security
in
a
handbag
and
withdraw
them
to
happy
country
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
justly
be
blame
for
this
want
of
patriotism
,
but
their
reply
be
that
they
have
be
unjustly
and
mercilessly
tax
by
man
who
deride
patriotism
,
misuse
power
,
and
neglect
the
real
interest
of
the
nation
in
the
desire
to
pander
to
the
mob
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
with
the

<EOS>
in

with

they
declare
that
it
be
a
positive
impossibility
to
live
in
England
,
while
into
the
bargain
their
life
be
expose
to
danger
from
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
as
a
result
of
this
wholesale
emigration
,
in
London
and
the
country
the
number
of
empty
house
inordinately
increase
,
and
there
be
few
well
-
to
-
do
people
leave
to
pay
the
rate
and
taxis
.
<EOS>
the
fearful
burden
of
the
extravagant
debt
which
the
british
municipality
have
heap
up
be
cruelly
feel
,
since
the
nation
have
to
repudiate
the
responsibility
which
it
have
incur
for
the
payment
of
interest
on
the
local
debt
.
<EOS>
the
socialist
dream
,
in
fact
,
may
almost
be
say
to
have
be
realise
.
<EOS>
there
be
few
rich
leave
,
but
the
consequence
to
the
poor
,
instead
of
be
beneficial
,
be
utterly
disastrous

<EOS>
under
the
pressure
of
public
opinion

constrain
by
hunger
and
financial
necessity

and
with
thousand
of

the

Empire
emerge
from

outwardly
intact

internally
so

only
the
most
resolute
reform

by
the
able

bold

with

extended

and

it

advantage

practically
the
entire
cost
of

have
be
bear
by
England

as

always
the

the

<EOS>
the
Socialists
,
who
have

be
faithless
friend
of
those
whom
they
profess
to

<EOS>
Their
dream
of
a
golden
age
prove
utterly
delusive

<EOS>
but
the
true
author
of
England
's
misfortune
escape
blame
for
the
moment
,
and
the
Army
and

be
make
the
scapegoat
of
the
great
catastrophe

<EOS>
when
success
do
come
,
it
come
too
late
,
and
could
not
be
utilise
without
a
great
british
Army
capable

carry
