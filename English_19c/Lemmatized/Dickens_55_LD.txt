upon

fierce
August
day
be
no
great
rarity
in
southern
France

<EOS>
everything
in
Marseilles
,
and
about
Marseilles
,
have
stare
at
the
fervid
sky

<EOS>
the
only
thing
to
be
see
not
fixedly
stare
and
glare
be
the
vine
droop
under
their
load
of
grape
.
 
<EOS>
these
do
occasionally
wink
a
little
,
as
the
hot
air
barely
move
their
faint
leave
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
no
wind
to
make
a
ripple
on
the
foul
water
within
the
harbour
,
or
on
the
beautiful
sea
without

<EOS>
the
line
of
demarcation
between
the
two
colour
,
black
and
blue

show
the
point
which
the
pure
sea
would
not
pass
;
but
it
lie
as
quiet
as
the
abominable
pool
,
with
which
it
never
mix

<EOS>
boat

from

too
intensely
blue
to

at
,
and
a
sky
of

,
set
with
one

jewel

<EOS>
the
universal
stare
make
the
eye
ache
.
 
<EOS>
towards
the

it

dusty

overhang
wayside
cottage
,
and
the
monotonous
wayside
avenue
of
parch
tree
without

,
droop
beneath
the

<EOS>
so
do
the
horse
with
drowsy
bell
,
in

creep

swiftly
over

the

so

with

with

little

in

<EOS>
It
receive
such
light
as
it
get
through
a
grating
of
iron
bar
fashion
like
a
pretty
large
window
,
by
mean
of
which
it
could
be
always
inspect
from
the
gloomy
staircase
on
which
the

<EOS>
there
be
a
broad
strong
ledge
of
stone
to
this
grating
where
the
bottom
of
it
be
let
into
the
masonry
,
three

four

<EOS>
upon

with

and
his
foot
and
shoulder
plant
against
the
opposite
side
of
the
aperture
.
 
<EOS>
the
bar
be
wide
enough
apart
to
admit
of
his
thrust
his
arm
through
to
the
elbow
;
and
so
he
hold
on
negligently
,
for
his
great
ease
.
   
<EOS>
a
prison
taint
be
on
everything
there
.
 
<EOS>
the
imprison
air
,
the
imprison
light
,
the
imprison
damp
,
the
imprison
man
,
be
all
deteriorate
by
confinement
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
captive
man
be
fade
and
haggard
,
so
the
iron
be
rusty
,
the
stone
be
slimy
,
the
wood
be
rotten
,
the
air
be
faint
,
the
light
be
dim
.
 
<EOS>
like
a
well
,
like
a
vault
,
like
a
tomb
,
the
prison
have
no
knowledge
of
the
brightness
outside
,
and
would
have
keep
its
polluted
atmosphere
intact
in
one
of
the
spice
island
of
the
indian
ocean
.
   
<EOS>
the
man
who
lie
on
the
ledge
of
the
grating
be
even
chill

<EOS>
He
jerk
his
great
cloak
more
heavily
upon
him
by
an
impatient
movement
of
one
shoulder
,

"

Brigand

a
Sun

<EOS>
He
be
wait
to
be
feed
,
look
sideway
through
the
bar
that
he
may
see
the
further
down
the
stair
,
with
much
of
the
expression
of
a
wild
beast
in
similar
expectation
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
eye
,
too
close
together
,
be
not
so
nobly
set
in
his
head
as
those
of
the
king
of
beast
be
in
his
,
and
they
be
sharp
rather
than
bright
---
point
weapon
with
little
surface
to
betray
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
no
depth
or
change
;
they
glitter
,
and
they
open
and
shut
.
 
<EOS>
so
far
,
and
waive
their
use
to
himself
,
a
clockmaker
could
have
make
a
well

<EOS>
He
have
a
hook
nose
,
<EOS>
handsome
after
its
kind
,
but
too
high
between
the
eye
by
probably
just
as
much
as
his
eye
be
too
near
to
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
rest
,
he
be
large
and
tall
in
frame
,
have
thin
lip
,
where
his
thick
moustache
show
them
at
all
,
and
a
quantity
of
dry
hair
,
of
no
definable
colour
,
in
its
shaggy
state
,
but
shoot
with
red

<EOS>
the
hand
with
which
he

ugly

unusually
small

the

when

interpose

Madame

be
unfortunately
a

I
seek

improve

she

resent
my

begin

propagate

become
notorious

It
have
be

that
I
treat
Madame

with
cruelty

I
may
have

nothing

I

do

almost
playfully

the

so
one

five

you

<EOS>
"
I
have
see
it

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
one
day
when
we
take
Pet
to
church
there
to
hear
the
music
---
because
,
as
practical
people
,
it
be
the
business
of
our
life
to
show
her
everything
that
we
think
can
please
her

<EOS>
mother
(
my
usual
name
for
Mrs

begin
to
cry
so
,
that
it
be
necessary
to
take
her
out
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
,
Mother
?
"
say
I
,
when
we
have
bring
her
a
little
round
:
<EOS>
"
you
be
frighten
Pet
,
my
dear
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
know
that
,
Father
,
"
say
Mother
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
think
it
be
through
my
love
her
so
much
,
that
it
ever
come
into
my
head
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
ever
what
come
into
your
head

mother
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
o
dear
,
dear
!
"
cry
Mother
,
break
out
again
,
"
when
I
see
all
those
child
range
tier
above
tier
,
and
appeal
from
the
father
none
of
them
have
ever
know
on
earth
,
to
the
great
Father
of
us
all
in
Heaven
,
I
think
,
do
any
wretched
mother
ever
come
here
,
and
look
among
those
young
face
,
wonder
which
be
the
poor
child
she
bring
into
this
forlorn
world
,
never
through
all
its

to
know
her
love
,
her
kiss

her
face

her
voice
,
even
her
name
!
"
 
<EOS>
now
that
be
practical
in
Mother
,
and
I
tell
her
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
Mother
,
that
be
what
I
call
practical
in
you

my

<EOS>
"
   
the
other
,
not
unmoved
,
assented
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
I
say
next
day
:
<EOS>
now
,
Mother
,
I
have
a
proposition
to
make
that
I
think
you
will
approve
of
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
take
one
of
those
same
little
child
to
be
a
little
maid
to
Pet
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
practical
people
.
 
<EOS>
so
if
we
should
find
her
temper
a
little
defective
,
or
any
of
her
way
a
little
wide
of
our
,
we
shall
know
what
we
have
to
take
into
account
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
know
what
an
immense
deduction
must
be
make
from
all
the
influence
and
experience
that
have
form
us
---
no
parent
,
no
child
-
brother
or
sister
,
no
individuality
of
home
,
no
Glass
Slipper
,
or
Fairy
Godmother
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
be
the
way
we
come
by
Tattycoram
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
the
name
itself
---
"
   
"
by
George
!
"
say
Mr
Meagles
,
"
I
be
forget
the
name
itself
.
<EOS>
why
,
she
be
call
in
the
Institution
,
Harriet
Beadle
---
an
arbitrary
name
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
Harriet
we
change
into
Hattey
,
and
then
into
Tatty
,
because
,
as
practical
people
,
we
think
even
a
playful
name
may
be
a
new
thing
to
her
,
and
may
have
a
soften
and
affectionate
kind
of
effect
,
do
not
you
see
?
 
<EOS>
as
to
Beadle
,
that
I
need
not
say
be
wholly
out
of
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
if
there
be
anything
that
be
not
to
be
tolerate
on
any
term
,
anything
that
be
a
type
of
Jack
-
in
-
office
insolence
and
absurdity
,
anything
that
represent
in
coat
,
waistcoat
,
and
big
stick
<EOS>
our
English
hold
on
by
nonsense
after
every
one
have
find
it
out
,
it
be
a
beadle
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
not
see
a
beadle
lately
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
an
Englishman
who
have
be
more
than
twenty
year
in
China

no

"
   
<EOS>
"
then
,
"
say
Mr
Meagles
,
lay
his
forefinger
on
his
companion
's
breast
with
great
animation

"
do
not
you
see
a
beadle
,
now
,
if
you
can
help
it

<EOS>
whenever
I

a
beadle
in
full
fig

come
down
a
street
on
a
Sunday
at
the
head
of
a
charity
school
,
I
be
oblige
to
turn
and
run
away

I
should
hit
him

<EOS>
the
name
of
Beadle
be
out
of
the
question
,
and
the
originator
of
the
Institution
for
these
poor
foundling
have
be
a
blessed
creature
of
the
name

Coram

we
give
that
name
to
Pet
's
little
maid
.
 
<EOS>
at
one
time
she
be
Tatty
,
and
at
one
time
she
be
Coram
,
until
we
get
into
a
way
of
mix
the
two
name
together

now
she
be
always
Tattycoram

the

when
they
have
take
another
silent
turn

fro

after
stand
for
a
moment
at

down

indeed

indeed

be
practical

a

have
gradually
spring
up
in
the
mind
of
Mrs

myself
which
perhaps
you
may
---

perhaps
you
may
not

understand

<EOS>
Pet
and
her
baby
sister
be
so
exactly
alike
,
and
so
completely
one

that
in
our
thought
we
have
never
be
able

separate
them
since

It
would
be
of
no
use
to
tell
us
that
our
dead
child
be
a
mere
infant

<EOS>
We
have
change
that

to
the
change

her
sister
have
become
more
sensible

womanly
by
just
the

degree
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be

hard
to
convince
me
that
if
I
be

pass
into
the
other
world
to

morrow
,
I
should
not
,
through
the
mercy
of
God
,
be
receive
there
by
a

just

as

I
understand
you

say
the

gently

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
to
her
,
"
pursue
her
father

"
the
sudden
loss
of
her

and
her
early
association
with
that
mystery

which
we
all
have
our
equal

which
be
not

so

Father

on

side
sit
Mr

a
tall
french
gentleman
with
raven
hair
and
beard
,
of
a
swart
and
terrible
,
not
to

genteelly
diabolical
aspect

who
have
show
himself
the
mild
of
man

a
handsome
young
Englishwoman

travel
quite
alone

who
have

proud
observant
face

have
either
withdraw
herself
from

be
avoid
by
the
rest

nobody

perhaps
,
could
have
quite
decide
which

the
rest
of
the
party
be
of
the
usual
material

traveller
on
business

and
traveller
for
pleasure
;
officer
from
India
on
leave
;
merchant
in
the
Greek
and
Turkey
trade
;
a
clerical
english
husband
in

meek

waistcoat

on

keep

tough

<EOS>
the
reserved
Englishwoman
take
up
Mr

in
his
last
remark
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
mean
that
a
prisoner
forgive
his
prison
?
"
say
she
,
slowly
and
with
emphasis
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
my
speculation
,
Miss
Wade
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
to
know
positively
how
a
prisoner
may
feel
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
be
one
before
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
mademoiselle
doubt
,
"
say
the
french
gentleman
in
his
own
language
,
"
it
be
be
so
easy
to
forgive
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
Pet
have
to
translate
this
passage
to
Mr
Meagles
,
who
never
by
any
accident
acquire
any
knowledge
whatever
of
the
language
of
any
country
into
which
he
travel
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
but
that
be
a
pity
,
be
not
it

"
   
<EOS>
"
that
I
be
not
credulous

"

Miss
Wade
.
   
<EOS>
"
not
exactly
that
.
 
<EOS>
put
it
another
way

<EOS>
that
you
can
not

it
easy
to
forgive

"
   
<EOS>
"
My
experience

she
quietly
return
,
"
have
be
correct
my

year

It

I

hear

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well

well

it

not
natural
to
bear
malice
,
I
hope
?
"
say
Mr
Meagles
,
cheerily
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
I
have
be
shut
up
in
any
place
to
pine
and
suffer

I
should
always
hate
that

wish

burn
it
down

raze
it
to
the
ground

<EOS>
I
know
no
more

"
<EOS>
"
Strong
,
sir
?
"
say
Mr
Meagles
to
the
Frenchman
;
it
be
another
of
his
habit
to
address
individual
of
all
nation
in
idiomatic
English
,
with
a
perfect
conviction
that
they
be
bind
to
understand
it
somehow
.
 
<EOS>
"
rather
forcible
in
our
fair
friend
,
you
will
agree
with
me
,
I
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
french
gentleman
courteously
reply
,
"
Plait

"
 
<EOS>
to
which
Mr
Meagles
return
with
much
satisfaction
,
"
You
be
right

<EOS>
My
opinion

"
   
<EOS>
the
breakfast
begin
by
-
and
-
by
to
languish
,
Mr
Meagles
make
the
company
a
speech
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
short
enough
and
sensible
enough
,
consider
that
it
be
a
speech
at
all
,
and
hearty
.
 
<EOS>
It
merely
go
to
the
effect
that
as
they
have
all
be
throw
together
by
chance
,
and
have
all
preserve
a
good
understanding
together
,
and
be
now
about
to
disperse
,
and
be
not
likely
ever
to
find
themselves
all
together
again
,
what
could
they
do
better
than
bid
farewell
to
one
another
,
and
give
one
another
good
-
speed
in
a
simultaneous
glass
of
cool
champagne
all
round
the
table
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
do
,
and
with
a
general
shaking
of
hand
the
assembly
break
up
for
ever
.
   
<EOS>
the
solitary
young
lady
all
this
time
have
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
She
rise
with
the
rest
,
and
silently
withdraw
to
a
remote
corner
of
the
great
room
,
where
she
sit
herself
on
a
couch
in
a
window
,
seem
to
watch
the
reflection
of
the
water
as
it
make
a
silver
quiver
on
the
bar
of
the
lattice
.
 
<EOS>
She
sit
,
turn
away
from
the
whole
length
of
the
apartment
,
as
if
she
be
lonely
of
her
own
haughty
choice
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
it
would
have
be
as
difficult
as
ever
to
say
,
positively
,
whether
she
avoid
the
rest
,
or
be
avoid
.
   
<EOS>
the
shadow
in
which
she
sit
,
fall
like
a
gloomy
veil
across
her
forehead
,
accord
very
well
with
the
character
of
her
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
one
could
hardly
see
the
face
,
so
still
and
scornful
,
set
off
by
the
arched
dark
eyebrow
,
and
the
fold
of
dark
hair
,
without
wonder
what
its
expression
would
be
if
a
change
come
over
it
.
 
<EOS>
that
it
could
soften
or
relent
,
appear
next
to
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
that
it
could
deepen
into
anger
or
any
extreme
of
defiance
,
and
that
it
must
change
in
that
direction
when
it
change
at
all
,
would
have
be
its
peculiar
impression
upon
most
observer
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
dress
and
trim
into
no
ceremony
of
expression
.
 
<EOS>
although
not
an
open
face
,
there
be
no
pretence
in
it

<EOS>
"
I

this
it

plainly

It

so
in

nostril

compressed

even
cruel
mouth

cover
either
two

the
third
would
have

so
still

<EOS>
mask
them
all

the
mere
turn

show
an
unsubduable

march
to
chapel
by
a
picquet
of

three
time
a
day
,
morally
handcuff

when
he
would
willingly

at

<EOS>
there
be
the
interminable
Sunday
of
his
nonage
;
when
his
mother
,
stern
of
face
and
unrelenting
of
heart
,
would
sit
all
day
behind
a
Bible

bind
,
like
her

construction
of

,
in
the
hard
,
bare
,
and
strait
board
,
with
one
dinted
ornament
on
the
cover
like
the
drag
of
a
chain
,
and
a
wrathful
sprinkling
of
red
upon
the
edge
of
the

as

be
a
fortification
against

<EOS>
there
be
the
resentful
Sunday
of
a
little
later
,
when
he
sit
down
glower
and
gloome
through
the
tardy
length
of
the
day
,
with
a
sullen
sense
of
injury
in
his
heart
,
and
no
more
real
knowledge
of
the
beneficent
history
of
the
New
Testament
than
if
he
have
be
breed
among
idolater

<EOS>
there
be
a
legion
of
Sundays

all

He
sit

look

if

ever
conscious

how
they
must
pity
themselves
for

<EOS>
sometimes
a

would
appear
behind
the
dingy

and
would
fade
away
into

gloom
as

presently

opposite

out
hopelessly
at

as

rain
drop
thick

out

<EOS>
in

the

port
wine

to

from

into

dip
certain

certain

She

put
on

read
certain
passage
aloud
from

sternly

fiercely

wrathfully

pray
that

may
be
put

consume

horror

usual
preparation

overshadow
him

She
shut
the
book

remain
for

little
time
with
her
face
shade
by
her
hand

so
do
the

otherwise
still

do

old
woman
in

dimmer

Chapter

<EOS>
Mrs
Flintwinch
have
a
dream
 
<EOS>
when
Mrs
Flintwinch
dream
,
she
usually
dream
,
unlike
the
son
of
her
old
mistress
,
with
her
eye
shut
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
a
curiously
vivid
dream
that
night
,
and
before
she
have
leave
the
son
of
her
old
mistress
many
hour
.
 
<EOS>
in
fact
it
be
not
at
all
like
a
dream
;
it
be
so
very
real
in
every
respect
.
 
<EOS>
It
happen
in
this
wise
.
   
<EOS>
the
bed
-
chamber
occupy
by
Mr
and
Mrs
Flintwinch
be
within
a
few
pace
of
that
to
which
Mrs
Clennam
have
be
so
long
confine
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
on
the
same
floor
,
for
it
be
a
room
at
the
side
of
the
house
,
which
be
approach
by
a
steep
descent
of
a
few
odd
step
,
diverge
from
the
main
staircase
nearly
opposite
to
Mrs
Clennam
's
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
could
scarcely
be
say
to
be
within
call
,
the
wall
,
door
,
and
panelling
of
the
old
place
be
so
cumbrous
;
but
it
be
within
easy
reach
,
in
any
undress
,
at
any
hour
of
the
night
,
in
any
temperature
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
head
of
the
bed
and
within
a
foot
of
Mrs
Flintwinch
's
ear
,
be
a
bell
,
the
line
of
which
hang
ready
to
Mrs

's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
whenever

bell
ring

and

in
the
sick
room
before
she
be

her
mistress
into
bed
,
light
her
lamp
,
and
give
her
good
night
,
Mrs
Flintwinch
go
to
roost
as
usual
,
save
that
her
lord
have
not
yet
appear
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
her
lord
himself
who
become
---
unlike
the
last
theme
in
the
mind
,
accord
to
the
observation
of
most
philosopher
---
the
subject
of
Mrs
Flintwinch
's
dream
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
her
that
she
awake
after
sleep
some
hour
,
and
find
Jeremiah
not

<EOS>
that
she
look
at
the
candle
she
have
leave

,
and
,
measure
the
time
like
King
Alfred
the
Great
,
be
confirm
by
its
waste
state
in
her
belief
that
she
have
be
asleep
for
some
considerable
period
.
 
<EOS>
that
she
arise
thereupon
,
muffle
herself
up
in
a
wrapper
,
put
on
her
shoe
,
and
go
out
on
the
staircase
,
much
surprised
,
to
look
for
Jeremiah
.
   
<EOS>
the
staircase
be
as
wooden
and
solid
as
need
be
,
and
Affery
go
straight
down
it
without
any
of
those
deviation
peculiar
to
dream
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
skim
over
it
,
but
walk
down
it
,
and
guide
herself
by
the
banister
on
account
of
her
candle
have
die
out
.
<EOS>
in
one
corner
of
the

,
behind

,
with
a
long
narrow

in
it
as
if
it
have
be

.
 
<EOS>
in
this
room
,
which

<EOS>
Mrs

and
peep
in
between

rusty

on
the
door
,
which
stand

<EOS>
She

down

Book

this

Arthur

her

twenty

little
more

half

<EOS>
not

her

youthful

there
be
more
consideration

naturally
belong

but
she
be
so
little

light

so
noiseless

shy

appear
so
conscious

out

Mrs

some
individual
recognition

as
there
be
degree

towards

She

an

to

successful

in

on

the
Marshalsea
Prison

<EOS>
It

stand
there
many
year
before

and
it
remain
there
some
year
afterwards
;
but
it
be
go
now
,
and
the
world
be
none
the
bad
without
it

<EOS>
It
be
an
oblong
pile
of
barrack
building

partition
into
squalid
house
stand
back
to

so
that
there
be
no

environ
by
a
narrow
pave

hem

duly
spike

<EOS>
Itself
a
close
and
confined
prison
for
debtor

it
contain
within
it
a
much
close
and
more
confined
jail
for
smuggler
.
 
<EOS>
offender
against
the
revenue
law

and
defaulter
to
excise
or
custom
who
have
incur
fine
which
they
be
unable

pay
,
be
suppose
to
be
incarcerate
behind
an
iron

plate
door
close
up
a
second
prison
,
consist
of
a
strong
cell
or
two
,
and
a
blind
alley
some
yard
and
a
half
wide
,
which
form
the
mysterious
termination
of
the
very
limited
skittle
-
ground
in
which
the
Marshalsea
debtor
bowl
down
their
trouble
.
   
<EOS>
suppose
to
be
incarcerate
there
,
because
the
time
have
rather
outgrow
the
strong
cell
and
the
blind
alley
.
 
<EOS>
in
practice
they
have
come
to
be
consider
a
little
too
bad
,
though
in
theory
they
be
quite
as
good
as
ever
;
which
may
be
observe
to
be
the
case
at
the
present
day
with
other
cell
that
be
not
at
all
strong
,
and
with
other
blind
alley
that
be
stone

blind

<EOS>
hence
the
smuggler
habitually
consort
with
the
debtor
(
who
receive
them
with
open

except
at
certain
constitutional
moment
when
somebody
come
from
some
Office

go
through
some
form
of
overlook
something
which
neither

anybody
else
know
anything
about

<EOS>
on
these
truly
british
occasion
,
the
smuggler
,
if
any
,
make
a
feint
of
walk
into
the
strong
cell
and
the
blind
alley
,
while
this
somebody
pretend
to
do
his
something

and
make
a
reality
of
walk
out
again
as
soon

neatly
epitomise
the

fight
them

he
may
have
break
the
net
that
hold
him
,
or
break
his
heart
;
but
be
what
he
be
,
he
languidly
slip
into
this
smooth
descent
,
and
never
more
take
one
step
upward
.
   
<EOS>
when
he
be
relieve
of
the
perplex
affair
that
nothing
would
make
plain
,
through
have
them
return
upon
his
hand
by
a
dozen
agent
in
succession
who
could
make
neither
begin
,
middle
,
nor
end
of
them
or
him
,
he
find
his
miserable
place
of
refuge
a
quieter
refuge
than
it
have
be
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
unpack
the
portmanteau
long
ago
;

his
eld
child
now
play
regularly
about
the
yard

everybody
know
the
baby

a
kind
of
proprietorship
in
her

We

pretty
well

His
word
be
remember
and
repeat
;
and
tradition
afterwards
hand
down
from
generation
to
generation
---
a
Marshalsea
generation
may
be
calculate
as
about
three
month
---
that
the
shabby
old
debtor
with
the
soft
manner
and
the
white
hair
,
be
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
.
   
<EOS>
and
he
grow
to
be
proud
of
the
title
.
 
<EOS>
if
any
impostor
have
arise
to
claim
it
,
he
would
have
shed
tear
in
resentment
of
the
attempt
to
deprive
him
of
his
right
.
 
<EOS>
a
disposition
begin
to
be
perceive
in
him
to
exaggerate
the
number
of
year
he
have
be
there
;
it
be
generally
understand
that
you
must
deduct
a
few
from
his
account
;
he
be
vain
,
the
fleeting
generation
of
debtor
say
.
   
<EOS>
all
new
-
comer
be
present
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
punctilious
in
the
exaction
of
this
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
the
wit
would
perform
the
office
of
introduction
with
overcharged
pomp
and
politeness
,
but
they
could
not
easily
overstep
his
sense
of
its
gravity
.
 
<EOS>
He
receive
them
in
his
poor
room
<EOS>
(
he
dislike
an
introduction
in
the
mere
yard
,
as
informal
---
a
thing
that
may
happen
to
anybody
)
,
with
a
kind
of
bow
-
down
beneficence
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
welcome
to
the
Marshalsea
,
he
would
tell
them
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
he
be
the
Father
of
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
so
the
world
be
kind
enough
to
call
him
;
and
so
he
be
,
if
more
than
twenty
year
of
residence
give
him
a
claim
to
the
title
.
 
<EOS>
It
look
small
at
first
,
but
there
be
very
good
company
there
---
among
a
mixture
---
necessarily
a
mixture
---
and
very
good
air
.
   
<EOS>
It
become
a
not
unusual
circumstance
for
letter
to
be
put
under
his
door
at
night
,
enclose
half
-
a
-
crown
,
two
half
-
crown
,
now
and
then
at
long
interval
even
half
-
a

sovereign
,
for
the
Father

the
Marshalsea
.
 
<EOS>
"
with
the
compliment
of
a
collegian
taking
leave
.

"
<EOS>
He
receive
the
gift
as
tribute
,
from
admirer
,
to
a
public
character
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
these
correspondent
assume
facetious
name
,
as
the

Bellows
,
Old
Gooseberry
,
Wideawake
,
Snooks
,
Mops
,
Cutaway
,
the
Dogs
-
meat
man
;
but
he
consider
this
in
bad
taste
,
and
be
always
a
little
hurt
by
it
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
fulness
of
time
,
this
correspondence
show
sign
of
wear
out
,
and
seem
to
require
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
correspondent
to
which
in
the
hurried
circumstance
of
departure
many
of
them
may
not
be
equal
,
he
establish
the
custom
of
attend
collegian
of
a
certain
standing
,
to
the
gate
,
and
take
leave
of
them
there
.
 
<EOS>
the
collegian
under
treatment
,
after
shake
hand
,
would
occasionally
stop
to
wrap
up
something
in
a
bit
of
paper
,
and
would
come
back
again
call
"
hi
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
would
look
round
surprised
.
<EOS>
"
Me
?
<EOS>
"
he
would
say
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
the
collegian
would
be
up
with
him
,
and
he
would
paternally
add
,
"
what
have
you
forget
?
 
<EOS>
what
can
I
do
for
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
forgot
to
leave
this
,
"
the
collegian
would
usually
return
,
"
for
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
good
sir
,
"
he
would
rejoin
,
"
he
be
infinitely
oblige
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
but
,
to
the
last
,
the
irresolute
hand
of
old
would
remain
in
the
pocket
into
which
he
have
slip
the
money
during
two
or
three
turn
about
the
yard
,
lest
the
transaction
should
be
too
conspicuous
to
the
general
body
of
collegians
.
   
<EOS>
one
afternoon
he
have
be
do
the
honour
of
the
place
to
a
rather
large
party
of
collegians
,
who
happen
to
be
go
out
,
when
,
as
he
be
come
back
,
he
encounter
one
from
the
poor

in
execution
for
a
small
sum
a
week
before

in
the
course
of
that
afternoon
,
and
be

<EOS>
the
man

a
mere
Plasterer
in
his
work

have
his
wife
with
him

a

be
in
high

"

They

the
Plasterer

he
say
to

feebly
burst
into
tear
.
   
<EOS>
the
Plasterer
turn
him
towards
the
wall
,
that
his
face
may
not

the
action

so
delicate

the
man
be
so
penetrate
with
repentance

ask
pardon
so
honestly

the
Child
of
the
Marshalsea
 
<EOS>
the
baby
whose
first
draught
of
air
have
be
tincture
with
Doctor
Haggage
's
brandy
,
be
hand
down
among
the
generation
of
collegians
,
like
the
tradition
of
their
common
parent
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
early
stage
of
her
existence
,
she
be
hand
down
in
a
literal
and
prosaic
sense
;
it
be
almost
a
part
of
the
entrance
footing
of
every
new
collegian
to
nurse
the
child
who
have
be
bear
in
the
college
.
   
<EOS>
"
by
right
,
"
remark
the
turnkey
when
she
be
first
show
to
him
,
"
I
ought
to
be
her
godfather
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
debtor
irresolutely
think
of
it
for
a
minute
,
and
say
,
"
perhaps
you
would
not
object
to
really
be
her
godfather
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
\i\
do
not
object
,
"
reply
the
turnkey
,
"
if
you
do
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
thus
it
come
to
pass
that
she
be
christen
one
Sunday
afternoon
,
when
the
turnkey
,
be
relieve
,
be
off
the
lock
;
and
that
the
turnkey
go
up
to
the
font
of
Saint
George
's
Church
,
and
promise
and
vow
and
renounce
on
her
behalf
,
as
he
himself
relate
when
he
come
back
,
"
like
a
good
'
un
.
"
   
<EOS>
this
invest
the
turnkey
with
a
new
proprietary
share
in
the
child
,
over
and
above
his
former
official
one
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
begin
to
walk
and
talk
,
he
become
fond
of
her
;
buy
a
little
arm
-
chair
and
stand
it
by
the
high
fender
of
the
lodge
fire
-
place
;
like
to
have
her
company
when
he
be
on
the
lock
;
and
use
to
bribe
her
with
cheap
toy
to
come
and
talk
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
,
for
her
part
,
soon
grow
so
fond
of
the
turnkey
that
she
would
come
climb
up
the
lodge
-
step
of
her
own
accord
at
all
hour
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
fall
asleep
in
the
little
armchair
by
the
high
fender
,
the
turnkey
would
cover
her
with
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
;
and
when
she
sit
in
it
dress
and
undress
a
doll
which
soon
come
to
be
unlike
doll
on
the
other
side
of
the
lock
,
and
to
bear
a
horrible
family
resemblance
to
Mrs
Bangham
---
he
would
contemplate
her
from
the
top
of
his
stool
with
exceed
gentleness
.
 
<EOS>
witness
these
thing
,
the
collegians
would
express
an
opinion
that
the
turnkey
,
who
be
a
bachelor
,
have
be
cut
out
by
nature
for
a
family
man
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
turnkey
thank
them
,
and
say
,
"
no
,
on
the
whole
it
be
enough
to
see
other
people
's
child
there
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
at
what
period
of
her
early
life
the
little
creature
begin
to
perceive
that
it
be
not
the
habit
of
all
the
world
to
live
lock
up
in
narrow
yard
surround
by
high
wall
with
spike
at
the
top
,
would
be
a
difficult
question
to
settle
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
a
very
,
very
little
creature
indeed
,
when
she
have
somehow
gain
the
knowledge
that
her
clasp
of
her
father
's
hand
be
to
be
always
loosen
at
the
door
which
the
great
key
open
;
and
that
while
her
own
light
step
be
free
to
pass
beyond
it
,
his
foot
must
never
cross
that
line
.
 
<EOS>
a
pitiful
and
plaintive
look
,
with
which
she
have
begin
to
regard
him
when
she
be
still
extremely
young
,
be
perhaps
a
part
of
this
discovery
.
   
<EOS>
with
a
pitiful
and
plaintive
look
for
everything
,
indeed
,
but
with
something
in
it
for
only
him
that
be
like
protection
,
this
child
of
the
Marshalsea
and
the
child
of
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
,
sit
by
her
friend
the
turnkey
in
the
lodge
,
keep
the
family
room
,
or
wander
about
the
prison
-
yard
,
for
the
first
eight
year
of
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
with
a
pitiful
and
plaintive
look
for
her
wayward
sister
;
for
her
idle
brother
;
for
the
high
blank
wall
;
for
the
fade
crowd
they
shut
in
;
for
the
game
of
the
prison
child
as
they
whoop
and
run
,
and
play
at
hide
-
and
-
seek
,
and
make
the
iron
bar
of
the
inner
gateway
"
home
.
"
   
wistful
and
wonder
,
she
would
sit
in
summer
weather
by
the
high
fender
in
the
lodge
,
look
up
at
the
sky
through
the
bar
window
,
until
,
when
she
turn
her
eye
away
,
bar
of
light
would
arise
between
her
and
her
friend
,
and
she
would
see
him
through
a
grating
,
too
.
<EOS>
"
think
of
the
field
,
"
the
turnkey
say
once
,
after
watch
her
,
"
be
not
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
where
be
they
?
"
<EOS>
she
inquire
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
they
be
---
over
there
,
my
dear
,
"
say
the
turnkey
,
with
a
vague
flourish
of
his
key
.
 
<EOS>
"
just
about
there
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
anybody
open
them
,
and
shut
them
?
 
<EOS>
be
they
lock
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
turnkey
be
discomfit
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
in
general
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
be
they
very
pretty
,
Bob
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
call
him
Bob
,
by
his
own
particular
request
and
instruction
.
   
<EOS>
"
lovely
.
 
<EOS>
full
of
flower
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
buttercup
,
and
there
be
daisy
,
and
there
be
"
---
the
turnkey
hesitate
,
be
short
of
floral
nomenclature
<EOS>
---
"
there
be
dandelion
,
and
all
manner
of
game
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
be
it
very
pleasant
to
be
there
,
Bob
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Prime
,
"
say
the
turnkey
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
father
ever
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
hem
!
"
cough
the
turnkey
.
 
<EOS>
"
o
yes
,
he
be
there
,
sometimes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
be
he
sorry
not
to
be
there
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
N
-
not
particular
,
"
say
the
turnkey
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
nor
any
of
the
people
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
,
glance
at
the
listless
crowd
within
.
 
<EOS>
"
o
be
you
quite
sure
and
certain
,
Bob
?
"
   
<EOS>
at
this
difficult
point
of
the
conversation
Bob
give
in
,
and
change
the
subject
to
hard
-
bake
:
always
his
last
resource
when
he
find
his
little
friend
get
him
into
a
political
,
social
,
or
theological
corner
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
the
origin
of
a
series
of
Sunday
excursion
that
these
two
curious
companion
make
together
.
 
<EOS>
They
use
to
issue
from
the
lodge
on
alternate
Sunday
afternoon
with
great
gravity
,
bind
for
some
meadow
or
green
lane
that
have
be
elaborately
appoint
by
the
turnkey
in
the
course
of
the
week
;
and
there
she
pick
grass
and
flower
to
bring
home
,
while
he
smoke
his
pipe
.
 
<EOS>
afterwards
,
there
be
tea
-
garden
,
shrimp
,
ale
,
and
other
delicacy
;
and
then
they
would
come
back
hand
in
hand
,
unless
she
be
more
than
usually
tired
,
and
have
fall
asleep
on
his
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
in
those
early
day
,
the
turnkey
first
begin
profoundly
to
consider
a
question
which
cost
him
so
much
mental
labour
,
that
it
remain
undetermined
on
the
day
of
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
He
decide
to
will
and
bequeath
his
little
property
of
saving
to
his
godchild
,
and
the
point
arise
how
could
it
be
so
"
tie
up
"
as
that
only
she
should
have
the
benefit
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
His
experience
on
the
lock
give
him
such
an
acute
perception
of
the
enormous
difficulty
of
"
tie
up
"
money
with
any
approach
to
tightness
,
and
contrariwise
of
the
remarkable
ease
with
which
it
get
loose
,
that
through
a
series
of
year
he
regularly
propound
this
knotty
point
to
every
new
insolvent
agent
and
other
professional
gentleman
who
pass
in
and
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
supposing
,
"
he
would
say
,
state
the
case
with
his
key
on
the
professional
gentleman
's
waistcoat
;
"
suppose
a
man
want
to
leave
his
property
to
a
young
female
,
and
want
to
tie
it
up
so
that
nobody
else
should
ever
be
able
to
make
a
grab
at
it
;
how
would
you
tie
up
that
property
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
settle
it
strictly
on
herself
,
"
the
professional
gentleman
would
complacently
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
but
look
here
,
"
quoth
the
turnkey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Supposing
she
have
,
say
a
brother
,
say
a
father
,
say
a
husband
,
who
would
be
likely
to
make
a
grab
at
that
property
when
she
come
into
it
---
how
about
that
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
settle
on
herself
,
and
they
would
have
no
more
legal
claim
on
it
than
you
,
"
would
be
the
professional
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
stop
a
bit
,
"
say
the
turnkey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Supposing
<EOS>
she
be
tender
-
hearted
,
and
they
come
over
her
.
 
<EOS>
where
be
your
law
for
tie
it
up
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
deep
character
whom
the
turnkey
sound
,
be
unable
to
produce
his
law
for
tie
such
a
knot
as
that
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
the
turnkey
think
about
it
all
his
life
,
and
die
intestate
after
all
.
   
<EOS>
but
that
be
long
afterwards
,
when
his
god
-
daughter
be
past
sixteen
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
half
of
that
space
of
her
life
be
only
just
accomplish
,
when
her
pitiful
and
plaintive
look
see
her
father
a
widower
.
 
<EOS>
from
that
time
the
protection
that
her
wonder
eye
have
express
towards
him
,
become
embody
in
action
,
and
the
child
of
the
Marshalsea
take
upon
herself
a
new
relation
towards
the
Father
.
   
<EOS>
at
first
,
such
a
baby
could
do
little
more
than
sit
with
him
,
desert
her
lively
place
by
the
high
fender
,
and
quietly
watch
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
make
her
so
far
necessary
to
him
that
he
become
accustomed
to
her
,
and
begin
to
be
sensible
of
miss
her
when
she
be
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
through
this
little
gate
,
she
pass
out
of
childhood
into
the
care
-
laden
world
.
   
<EOS>
what
her
pitiful
look
see
,
at
that
early
time
,
in
her
father
,
in
her
sister
,
in
her
brother
,
in
the
jail
;
how
much
,
or
how
little
of
the
wretched
truth
it
please
God
to
make
visible
to
her
;
lie
hide
with
many
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
enough
that
she
be
inspire
to
be
something
which
be
not
what
the
rest
be
,
and
to
be
that
something
,
different
and
laborious
,
for
the
sake
of
the
rest
.
<EOS>
inspire
?
 
<EOS>
yes
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
we
speak
of
the
inspiration
of
a
poet
or
a
priest
,
and
not
of
the
heart
<EOS>
impel
by
love
and
self
-
devotion
to
the
lowly
work
in
the
lowly
way
of
life
!
   
<EOS>
with
no
earthly
friend
to
help
her
,
or
so
much
as
to
see
her
,
but
the
one
so
strangely
assorted
;
with
no
knowledge
even
of
the
common
daily
tone
and
habit
of
the
common
member
of
the
free
community
who
be
not
shut
up
in
prison
;
bear
and
breed
in
a
social
condition
,
false
even
with
a
reference
to
the
false
condition
outside
the
wall
;
drink
from
infancy
of
a
well
whose
water
have
their
own
peculiar
stain
,
their
own
unwholesome
and
unnatural
taste
;
the
Child
of
the
Marshalsea
begin
her
womanly
life
.
   
<EOS>
no
matter
through
what
mistake
and
discouragement
,
what
ridicule
(
not
unkindly
mean
,
but
deeply
feel
)
of
her
youth
and
little
figure
,
what
humble
consciousness
of
her
own
babyhood
and
want
of
strength
,
even
in
the
matter
of
lift
and
carry
;
through
how
much
weariness
and
hopelessness
,
and
how
many
secret
tear
;
she
drudge
on
,
until
recognise
as
useful
,
even
indispensable
.
 
<EOS>
that
time
come
.
 
<EOS>
She
take
the
place
of
eld
of
the
three
,
in
all
thing
but
precedence
;
be
the
head
of
the
fall
family
;
and
bore
,
in
her
own
heart
,
its
anxiety
and
shame
.
   
<EOS>
at
thirteen
,
she
could
read
and
keep
account
,
that
is
,
could
put
down
in
word
and
figure
how
much
the
bare
necessary
that
they
want
would
cost
,
and
how
much
less
they
have
to
buy
them
with
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
,
by
snatch
of
a
few
week
at
a
time
,
to
an
evening
school
outside
,
and
get
her
sister
and
brother
send
to
day
-
school
by
desultory
start
,
during
three
or
four
year
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
instruction
for
any
of
them
at
home
;
but
she
know
well
---
no
one
well
---
that
a
man
so
broken
as
to
be
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
,
could
be
no
father
to
his
own
child
.
   
<EOS>
to
these
scanty
mean
of
improvement
,
she
add
another
of
her
own
contriving
.
 
<EOS>
once
,
among
the
heterogeneous
crowd
of
inmate
there
appear
a
dancing
-
master
.
 
<EOS>
Her
sister
have
a
great
desire
to
learn
the
dancing
-
master
's
art
,
and
seem
to
have
a
taste
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
at
thirteen
year
old
,
the
child
of
the
Marshalsea
present
herself
to
the
dancing
-
master
,
with
a
little
bag
in
her
hand
,
and
prefer
her
humble
petition
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
if
you
please
,
I

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>

the
small
figure
and
uplifted
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,

.
"
   
<EOS>
"
and
what
can
I
do
for
you
?
"
say
the
dancing

master
.
   
<EOS>
"
nothing
for
me
,
sir
,
thank
you
,
"
anxiously
undrawe
the
string
of
the
little
bag
;
"
but
if
,
while
you
stay
here
,
you
could
be
so
kind
as
to
teach
my
sister
<EOS>
cheap
---
"
   
"
My
child
,
I
will
teach
her
for
nothing
,
"
say
the
dancing
-
master
,
shut
up
the
bag
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
as
good
-
natured
a
dancing
-
master
as
ever

to
the
Insolvent
Court
,
and
he
keep
his
word
.
 
<EOS>
the

so
apt
a
pupil
,
and
the
dancing
-
master
have
such
abundant
leisure
to
bestow
upon
her
<EOS>
(
for
it
take
him
a
matter
of
ten
week
to
set
to
his
creditor
,
lead
off
,
turn
the
Commissioners
,
and
right
and
leave
back
to
his
professional
pursuit

,
that
wonderful
progress
be

.
 
<EOS>
indeed
the
dancing
-
master
be
so
proud
of
it
,
and
so
wishful
to
display
it
before
he
leave
to
a
few
select
friend
among
the
collegians
,
that
at
six
o'clock
on

much
ground

and
the
step
be
so
conscientiously

,
that
the
dancing

master

<EOS>
the
success

his
instruction
after
his
release

embolden
the
poor
child
to
try
again
.
 
<EOS>
She
watch
and
wait
month
for
a
seamstress
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
fulness
of
time
a
milliner
come
in
,
and
to
her
she
repair
on
her
own
behalf

<EOS>
"

timidly
round
the
door
of

I

<EOS>
everybody
seem
to

of
her
as
soon

they
arrive

for
the
milliner
sit
up
in

He

in

confusion
of
grey
hair
and
rusty

His
trouser

so
long

loose

the

<EOS>
the
unaccustomed
visitor
from

naturally
assume
everybody
here
to
be
prisoner

landlord

potboy
,
and
all
.
<EOS>
whether
they

they
all

the

He
have
be
a
tailor
in

have
keep
a
phaeton

he
say
.
 
<EOS>
He
boast
that
he
stand
up
litigiously
for
the
interest
of
the
college
;
and
he
have
undefined
and
undefinable
idea
that
the
marshal
intercept
a
"
Fund
,
"
which
ought
to
come
to
the
collegians
.
 
<EOS>
He
like
to
believe
this
,
and
always
impress
the
shadowy
grievance
on
new

comer

stranger
;
though
he
could
not
,
for
his

have
explain
what
Fund
he
mean

how
the

get
root
in

He
have
fully
convince
himself
,
notwithstanding
,
that
his
own
proper
share
of
the
Fund
be
three

ninepence
a

;
and
that
in
this
amount
he
,
as
an
individual
collegian
,
be
swindle
by
the

,
regularly
every
Monday
.
<EOS>
apparently
,
he
help

make

that
he
may
not
lose
an
opportunity

state
this

that
he
be
go

write
a

to

show
the

up

he
fall
into
miscellaneous
conversation
with

rest

<EOS>
It
be
evident
from
the
general
tone
of

,
that
they
have
come
to
regard
insolvency
as
the
normal
state
of
mankind

the

a
disease

the

<EOS>
His

with
the

a

<EOS>
in
that
long
imprisonment

<EOS>
the
morning
light
be
in
no
hurry
to
climb
the
prison
wall
and
look
in
at
the
snuggery
window
;
and
when
it
do

it
would
have
be
more
welcome
if
it
have
come
alone
,
instead
of
bring
a

but
the

be
blow
out

the

<EOS>
Arthur

would
have
be
little
disposed

linger

though
his

the

dropping

glide
out

It
be
too
early
for
her

"
Amy

Mr

what

you

<EOS>

I
be
much
impressed

Mr

by
all

She

duty

"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
fancy
that
he
hear
in
these
praise
a
certain
tone
of
custom
,
which
he
have
hear
from
the
father
last
night
with
an
inward
protest

feeling
of
antagonism
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
they
stint
her
praise
,
or
be
insensible
to
what
she
do
for
them
;
but
that
they
be
lazily
habituate
to
her
,
as
they
be
to
all
the
rest
of
their
condition
.
 
<EOS>
He
fancy
that
although
they
have
before
them
,
every
day
,
the
mean
of
comparison
between
her
and
one
another
and
themselves
,
they
regard
her
as
be
in
her
necessary
place
;
as
hold
a
position
towards
them
all
which
belong
to
her
,
like
her
name
or
her
age
.
 
<EOS>
He
fancy
that
they
view
her
,
not
as
have
rise
away
from
the
prison
atmosphere
,
but
as
appertain
to
it
;
as
be
vaguely
what
they
have
a
right
to
expect
,
and
nothing
more
.

Her

resume

<EOS>
that

Amy

he

and
go
down
to
let
her
in

leave
the
visitor
with
as
vivid
a
picture
on
his
mind
of
his
begrimed
hand

dirt

wear
face

decay
figure

She
come
up
after
him

in
the
usual
plain
dress

with
the
usual
timid
manner

<EOS>
Her
lip
be
a
little
parted

as

beat
faster

"

She

<EOS>
He
make
a
pretence

mislay
his

stick

to
set
the

right

to

impatient

at

go
down

he

the

Mr

They
bear
the
try
spectacle
in
silence
,
until
the
mysterious
visitor
be
at
a
safe
distance
;
when
they
burst
into
pebble

yell
,
and
likewise
into
revile
dance
,
and
in
all
respect
bury
the
pipe
of
peace

so
many

that

they
could
scarcely
have
do
great
justice
to
their

in
the
midst
of
this
homage
,
Mr
Arthur
Clennam
offer
his
arm
to
Little
Dorrit

Little
Dorrit
take
it

<EOS>
"
Will
you
go

Iron
Bridge

"
say
he
,
"
where
there
be
an
escape
from
the
noise
of
the
street

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
little

answer
,
if
he

and
presently
venture

he

Mr

<EOS>
thus
do
Cripples
unconsciously
become
a
master
of
the
ceremony
between

bring

more
naturally
together
than
Beau
Nash
may
have
do

the

squally

muddy

the

moment

think

if

<EOS>
perhaps
he
seem

as

young

<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry

He
notice
that

be
quite
a
majestic
hotel
to
her

that
she
treasure
its
reputation

<EOS>
"
I
believe

say
Little

tell

she
add
timidly

<EOS>
be
you

"
<EOS>
oh

only
into

<EOS>
"
I

He
meet
her

raise

so
much
wonder
in
them
<EOS>
(
she
be
scared
when
the
encounter
take
place
,
and
shrunk
away
again
)
,
that
he
feel
it
necessary
to
say
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
reason
for
asking
,
which
I
can
not
very
well
explain

but
you
must
,
on
no
account
,
suppose
it
to
be
of
a
nature
to
cause
you
the
least
alarm

anxiety

<EOS>
quite
the
reverse

<EOS>
and
you
think
that
at
no

your

my

Clennam
ever
familiar
to
him

<EOS>
"
no

from

up

he
look

rather

quicker
still
by

thus
they
emerge
upon
the

fierce

<EOS>
little

seem

<EOS>
"
let
me
put
you

Clennam

very

She
hurriedly
decline

wet

dry

He
know
it
to
be
so

be
touch

more
pity

thinking
of
the
slight
figure
at
his
side

make
its
nightly
way
through
the
damp
dark
boisterous
street
to
such
a
place
of
rest

<EOS>
"
You
speak
so
feelingly

me

I
find
afterwards

affection

have
find

in

some

formidable
Mr

near

the
Circumlocution

quite
crush

Little
Dorrit

shake

She
forget
to
be
shy
at
the
moment

in
honestly
warn
him
away
from
the
sunken
wreck
he
have
a
dream

raise

look
at
him
with
eye

assuredly

in

patient
face

her
fragile
figure

her
spare
dress

where
could
father
live

how
could

I
have
often
think
that

such

change
could
come

it

be
anything

a
service

among

jostle
by
the

be
bear

shrink
through
them

familiar

misplace

long
acquaintance

the
squalid
need
of
life

innocence

solicitude

stop

look
back

fall
down

Mr

heated
state

attract

"
 
<EOS>
He
happen
to
have
turn
his
eye
towards
the
offender
whom
Mr
Meagles
have
so
angrily
collar
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
something
to
look
at
,
that
fellow
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
be
not
much
to
look
at
,
either
in
point
of
size
or
in
point
of
dress
;
be
merely
a
short
,
square
,
practical
looking
man
,
whose
hair
have
turn
grey
,
and
in
whose
face
and
forehead
there
be
deep
line
of
cogitation
,
which
look
as
though
they
be
carve
in
hard
wood
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
dress
in
decent
black
,
a
little
rusty
,
and
have
the
appearance
of
a
sagacious
master
in
some
handicraft
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
spectacle
-
case
in
his
hand
,
which
he
turn
over
and
over
while
he
be
thus
in
question
,
with
a
certain
free
use
of
the
thumb
that
be
never
see
but
in
a
hand
accustom
to
tool
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
keep
with
us
,
"
say
Mr
Meagles
,
in
a
threatening
kind
of
way
,
"
and
I
will
introduce
you
presently
.
 
<EOS>
now
then
!
"
   
Clennam
wonder
within
himself
,
as
they
take
the
near
way
to
the
Park
,
what
this
unknown
(
who
comply
in
the
gentle
manner
)
could
have
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
His
appearance
do
not
at
all
justify
the
suspicion
that
he
have
be
detect
in
design
on
Mr
Meagles
's
pocket
-
handkerchief
;
nor
have
he
any
appearance
of
be
quarrelsome
or
violent
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
quiet
,
plain
,
steady
man
;
make
no
attempt
to
escape
;
and
seem
a
little
depressed
,
but
neither
ashamed
nor
repentant
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
be
a
criminal
offender
,
he
must
surely
be
an
incorrigible
hypocrite
;
and
if
he
be
no
offender
,
why
should
Mr
Meagles
have
collar
him
in
the
Circumlocution
Office
?
 
<EOS>
He
perceive
that
the
man
be
not
a
difficulty
in
his
own
mind
alone
,
but
in
Mr
Meagles
's
too
;
for
such
conversation
as
they
have
together
on
the
short
way
to
the
Park
be
by
no
means
well
sustain
,
and
Mr
Meagles
's
eye
always
wander
back
to
the
man
,
even
when
he
speak
of
something
very
different
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
they
be
among
the
tree
,
Mr
Meagles
stop
short
,
and
say
:
   
"
Mr
Clennam

do
me
the
favour

<EOS>
"
I

should

now

<EOS>
"
I
should
say
,
"
return
Arthur
Clennam

a
faint
smile

's
face

not

<EOS>
"
You
be
right

say
Mr
Meagles

"

a
smith

<EOS>
He

cost
him
,

how
many
year

say
Mr

address
Doyce
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
the
most
exasperating
man
in
the
world
;
he
never
complain
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
rather
well
than
twelve
year

"
rather
better

say
Mr

,
in
danger
of
make
himself
excessively
hot
again
,
"
he
cease
to
be
an
innocent
citizen
,
and
become
a
culprit
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
treat
from
that
instant
as
a
man

have
do
some
infernal
action

a

it
be
justifiable
to
get
rid
of
anyhow
;
a
man
to
be
wear
out
by
all
possible

"
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
so
difficult
to
believe
,
after
the
morning
's
experience
,
as
Mr
Meagles
suppose
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
stand
there

over

cry
Mr

what
you
confess

I
undoubtedly

I
have
frequently
find
it
necessary

that
I
really
have
not

anything

<EOS>
with
this
prelude
,
Mr
Meagles
go
through
the
narrative
;
the
establish
narrative
,
which
have
become
tiresome
;
the
matter

of

course
narrative
which
we
all
know
by
heart

<EOS>
how
,
after
interminable

two
,
allow
the
culprit
to
make
certain
trial
of
his

how
the
trial
be
make
in
the
presence
of
a
board
of
six
,
of
whom
two
ancient
member
be
too
blind

two

deaf

hear
it

one

and
the
final
ancient

how
there
be
more
year

more
impertinence

number
five
thousand
one
hundred

whereby
they
resign

in
course
of
time

take
up
the
business
as
if
it
be
a
bran
new
thing
of

which
have
never

hear
of
before
;
muddle
the

toss

in
a
wet
blanket
.
 
<EOS>
how
the
impertinence
,
ignorance
,
and
insult
go
through
the
multiplication
table
.
 
<EOS>
how
there
be
a
reference
of
the
invention
to
three
barnacle
and
a
stiltstalking
,
who
know
nothing
about
it
;
into

nothing
could
be
hammer
about

who
get
bore
about

how

Circumlocution
Office
,
in
a

number
eight
thousand
seven
hundred

forty
,
"
see
no

<EOS>
how
there
have
be
a
final
interview
with
the
head
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
that
very
morning
,
and
how
the
Brazen
Head
have
speak
,
and
have
be
,
upon
the
whole
,
and
under
all
the
circumstance
,
and
look
at
it
from
the
various
point
of
view
,
of
opinion
that
one
of
two
course
be
to
be
pursue
in
respect
of
the
business
<EOS>
:
that
be
to
say
,
either
to
leave
it
alone
for
evermore

to
begin
it
all
over
again

<EOS>
"
upon
which
,
"
say
Mr

,
"
as
a
practical
man
,
I
then
<EOS>

there
,
in
that
presence
,
take
Doyce
by
the
collar
,
and
tell
him
it
be
plain
to
me
that
he
be
an
infamous
rascal
and
treasonable
disturber
of
the
government
peace
,

take
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
bring
him
out
of
the
office
door
by
the
collar
,
that
the
very
porter
may
know
I
be
a
practical
man
who
appreciate
the
official
estimate
of
such
character
;
and
here
we
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
if
that
airy
young
Barnacle
have
be
there
,
he
would
have
frankly
tell
them
perhaps
that
the
Circumlocution
Office
have
achieve
its
function
.
 
<EOS>
that
what
the
Barnacles
have
to
do
,
be
to
stick
on
to
the
national
ship
as
long
as
they
could
.
 
<EOS>
that
to
trim
the
ship
,
lighten
the
ship
,
clean
the
ship
,
would
be
to
knock
them
off
;
that
they
could
but
be
knock
off
once
;
and
that
if
the
ship
go
down
with
them
yet
stick
to
it
,
that
be
the
ship
's
look
out
,
and
not
theirs
.
   
<EOS>
"
there

say
Mr
Meagles

"
now
you
know
all
about
Doyce

,
which
I
own

"
well

with

I
know

do

I
may

how

no

with
that
he
put
up
his

to
Arthur

do
not
complain

Mr

Mr

<EOS>
Arthur
could
not

glance
at
Daniel
Doyce
in
the
ensue
silence

<EOS>
though
it
be
evidently
in
the
grain
of
his
character
,
and
of
his
respect
for
his
own
case
,
that
he
should
abstain
from
idle
murmuring

it
be
evident
that
he
have
grow
the
old
,
the
sterner
,

the
poor
,
for
his
long
endeavour

<EOS>
He
could
not

think
what
a
bless
thing
it
would
have
be
for
this
man
,
if
he
have
take
a
lesson
from
the
gentleman
who
be
so
kind
as
to
take
a
nation

affair
in
charge
,

have
learn
how
not
to
do
it

<EOS>
Mr

be
hot
and
despondent
for
about
five
minute
,

then
begin

cool

clear
up

come

cheerfully

<EOS>
as
they
go
along

certainly
one

sodden

limp
along

as

the
wail

sullenly

shrinkingly

sometimes
stop

turn
about

He

so
his

on

They
be

Mr

uncommon
hard
up

to
be
sure

<EOS>
well
,
he
could
not

how
it

he
do
not

anybody
could
say
how

all
he

be

that
so
it

when

know'd

well

no

<EOS>
then
you

some

a

pretty
close

down

you

in

you

there

Mr

Mr

He

It

He

only
know'd

that

what

that

<EOS>
and
,
in
brief

his
illogical
opinion
be

that
if

you
have
better
take
nothing

thus

in

<EOS>
the
mention
of
Mr
Casby
again
revive
in
Clennam
's
memory
the
smoulder
ember
of
curiosity
and
interest
which
Mrs
Flintwinch
have
fan
on
the
night
of
his
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
Casby
have

Flora

Christopher

so
he

still
occasionally
speak

some
irreverent

who
have
have
dealing

him

in
whom
familiarity
have
breed
its
proverbial
result
perhaps
)

who

repute
to
be
rich

tenant
,
and
to
get
a
good
quantity
of
blood
out
of
the
stone
of
several
unpromising
court
and
alley
.
<EOS>
after
some
day
of
inquiry
and
research
,
Arthur
Clennam
become
convinced
that
the
case
of
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
be
indeed
a
hopeless
one
,
and
sorrowfully
resign
the
idea
of
help
him
to
freedom
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
hopeful
inquiry
to
make
at
present
,
concern
Little
Dorrit
either
;
but
he
argue
with
himself
that
it
may
---
for
anything
he
know
---
it
may
be
serviceable
to
the
poor
child
,
if
he
renew
this
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
necessary
to
add
that
beyond
all
doubt
he
would
have
present
himself
at
Mr
Casby
's
door
,
if
there
have
be
no
little
Dorrit
in
existence
;
for
we
all
know
how
we
all
deceive
ourselves
---
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
,
how
people
in

,
our
profounder
selve

deceive
themselves

as
to
motive
of
action

<EOS>
with
a
comfortable
impression
upon
him
,
and
quite
an
honest
one
in
its
way
,
that
he
be
still
patronise
little
Dorrit
in
do
what
have
no
reference
to
her

he
find
himself
one
afternoon
at
the
corner
of
Mr

street
.
 
<EOS>
Mr

live
in
a
street
in
the
Gray

Inn
Road
,
which
have
set
off
from
that
thoroughfare
with
the
intention
of
run
at
one
heat
down
into
the
valley
,
and
up
again
to
the
top
of
Pentonville
Hill
;
but
which
have
run
itself
out
of
breath
in
twenty
yard

and
have
stand
still
ever
since

<EOS>
there
be
no
such
place
in
that
part
now
;
but
it
remain
there
for
many
year
,
look
with
a
baulk
countenance
at
the
wilderness
patch
with
unfruitful
garden
and
pimple
with
eruptive
summerhouse
,
that
it
have
mean
to

but
the

outside

I
know
its

to
come
upon

<EOS>
when
his

bright

of
obsolete

bring
a

those

He

there

perhaps
there

in

so
troublesome

sit

upon
a
bank
of
violet

move
to
precocious
contemplation
by
the

there

placid

the

bald

the

nevertheless

proclaim
by
common
report
rich
in
house
property
;
and
with
that
head
,
he
now
sit
in
his
silent
parlour
.
<EOS>
indeed
it
would
be
the
height
of
unreason
to
expect
him
to
be
sit
there
without
that
head

Arthur

move
to
attract
his

I

<EOS>
how
have
you

"
   
<EOS>
without
think
it
worth
while
to
explain
that
in
the
course
of
some
quarter
of
a
century
he
have
experience
occasional
slight
fluctuation
in
his
health
and
spirit
,
Clennam
answer
generally
that
he
have
never
be
well
,
or
something
equally
to
the
purpose
;
and
shake
hand
with
the
possessor
of
"
that
head

as
it
shed
its
patriarchal
light
upon
him

<EOS>
"
We

Mr

not

Clennam

<EOS>
after
this
wise
remark
he
feel
that
he
be
scarcely
shine
with
brilliancy
,
and
become
aware
that
he
be
nervous
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>

Mr

I
be
grieve
to
hear
it

Mr

,
I
be
grieve

"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
reply
in
the
usual
way
that
he
feel
infinitely
oblige
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
time
,
"
say
Mr

,
"
when
your
parent
and
myself
be
not
on
friendly
term

<EOS>
there
be
a
little
family
misunderstand
among
us

<EOS>
Your
respect
mother
be
rather
jealous
of
her

maybe
;
when
I
say
her
son

I

<EOS>
His
smooth
face
have
a
bloom
upon
it
like
ripe
wall

fruit

<EOS>
what
with
his
blooming
face
,
and
that
head
,
and
his
blue
eye
,
he
seem
to
be
deliver
sentiment
of
rare
wisdom

virtue

<EOS>
in
like
manner
,
his
physiognomical
expression
seem
to
teem
with
benignity

nobody
could
have
say
where
the
wisdom
be

where
the
virtue
be

where
the
benignity

they
all
seem

be
somewhere
about

those

however

pursue
Mr

be
past

past

<EOS>
I
do
myself
the
pleasure
of
make
a
visit
to
your
respect
mother
occasionally
,
and
of
admire
the
fortitude
and
strength
of
mind
with
which
she
bear
her
trial

bear
her
trial

<EOS>
"
 
when
he
make
one
of
these
little
repetition
,
sit
with
his
hand
cross
before
him
,
he
do
it
with
his
head
on
one
side
,
and
a
gentle
smile
,
as
if
he
have
something
in
his
thought
too
sweetly
profound
to
be
put
into
word
.
 
<EOS>
as
if
he
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
utter
it
,
lest
he
should
soar
too
high
;
and
his
meekness
therefore
prefer
to
be
unmeaning

"
I
have
hear

My

I
should
have
prefer

"
   
<EOS>
upon
this
Mr
Casby
rise
up
in
his
list
shoe
,
and
with
a
slow
,
heavy
step
(
he
be
of
an
elephantine
build
)
,
make
for
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
long
wide
-
skirt
bottle
-
green
coat
on
,
and
a
bottle
-
green
pair
of
trouser
,
and
a
bottle

green
waistcoat

<EOS>
the
Patriarchs
be
not
dress
in
bottle
-
green
broadcloth
,
and
yet
his
clothe
look
patriarchal
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
scarcely
leave
the
room
,
and
allow
the
ticking
to
become
audible
again
,
when
a
quick
hand
turn
a
latchkey
in
the
house
-
door
,
open
it
,
and
shut
it
.
 
<EOS>
immediately
afterwards
,
a
quick
and
eager
short
dark
man
come
into
the
room
with
so
much
way
upon
him
that
he
be
within
a
foot
of
Clennam
before
he
could
stop
.
   
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
   
<EOS>
Clennam
see
no
reason
why
he
should
not
say
"
Halloa
!
"
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
be
the
matter
?
"
say
the
short
dark
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not

anything

return
Clennam

<EOS>
"
where
be
Mr

<EOS>
"
ask
the
short

look
about

He

"
   
<EOS>
"
\i\
want
him

"
say
the
short
dark
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
?
"
<EOS>
this
elicit
a
word
or
two
of
explanation
from
Clennam
,
during
the
delivery
of
which
the
short
dark
man
hold
his
breath
and
look
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
dress
in
black
and
rusty
iron
grey
;
have
jet
black
bead
of
eye
;
a
scrubby
little
black
chin
;
wiry
black
hair
strike
out
from
his
head
in
prong
,
like
fork
or
hair
-
pin
;
and
a
complexion
that
be
very
dingy
by
nature
,
or
very
dirty
by
art
,
or
a
compound
of
nature
and
art
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
dirty
hand
and
dirty
broken
nail
,
and
look
as
if
he
have
be
in
the
coal
;
he
be
in
a
perspiration
,
and
snort
and
sniff
and
puff
and
blow
,
like
a
little
labour
steam
-
engine
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
he
,
when
Arthur
tell
him
how
he
come
to
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
"
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
should
ask
for
panck
,
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
say
that
Pancks
be
come
in
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
with
a
snort
and
a
puff
,
he
work
out
by
another
door
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
in
the
old
day
at
home
,
certain
audacious
doubt
respect
the
last
of
the
Patriarchs
,
which
be
afloat
in
the
air
,
have
,
by
some
forget
mean
,
come
in
contact
with
Arthur
's
sensorium
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
aware
of
mote
and
speck
of
suspicion
in
the
atmosphere
of
that
time
;
see
through
which
medium
,
Christopher
Casby
be
a
mere
Inn
signpost
,
without
any
Inn
---
an
invitation
to
rest
and
be
thankful
,
when
there
be
no
place
to
put
up
at
,
and
nothing
whatever
to
be
thankful
for
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
that
some
of
these
speck
even
represent
Christopher
as
capable
of
harbour
design
in
"
that
head
,
"
and
as
be
a
crafty
impostor
.
 
<EOS>
other
mote
there
be
which
show
him
as
a
heavy
,
selfish
,
drift
Booby
,
who
,
have
stumble
,
in
the
course
of
his
unwieldy
jostling
against
other
man
,
on
the
discovery
that
to
get
through
life
with
ease
and
credit
,
he
have
but
to
hold
his
tongue
,
keep
the
bald
part
of
his
head
well
polished
,
and
leave
his
hair
alone
,
have
have
just
cunne
enough
to
seize
the
idea
and
stick
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
say
that
his
be
town
-
agent
to
Lord
Decimus
Tite
Barnacle
be
referable
,
not
to
his
have
the
least
business
capacity
,
but
to
his
look
so
supremely
benignant
that
nobody
could
suppose
the
property
screw
or
job
under
such
a
man
;
also
,
that
for
similar
reason
he
now
get
more
money
out
of
his
own
wretched
letting
,
unquestione
,
than
anybody
with
a
less
nobby
and
less
shine
crown
could
possibly
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
it
be
represent
(
Clennam
call
to
mind
,
alone
in
the
ticking
parlour
)
that
many
people
select
their
model
,
much
as
the
painter
,
just
now
mention
,
select
theirs
;
and
that
,
whereas
in
the
Royal
Academy
some
evil
old
ruffian
of
a
Dog
-
stealer
will
annually
be
find
embody
all
the
cardinal
virtue
,
on
account
of
his
eyelash
,
or
his
chin
,
or
his
leg
(
thereby
plant
thorn
of
confusion
in
the
breast
of
the
more
observant
student
of
nature
)
,
so
,
in
the
great
social
exhibition
,
accessory
be
often
accept
in
lieu
of
the
internal
character
.
   
<EOS>
call
these
thing
to
mind
,
and
range
Mr
Pancks
in
a
row
with
them
,
Arthur
Clennam
lean
this
day
to
the
opinion
,
without
quite
decide
on
it
,
that
the
last
of
the
Patriarchs
be
the
drift
Booby
aforesaid
,
with
the
one
idea
of
keep
the
bald
part
of
his
head
highly
polished
:
and
that
,
much
as
an
unwieldy
ship
in
the
Thames
river
may
sometimes
be
see
heavily
drive
with
the
tide
,
broadside
on
,
stern
first
,
in
its
own
way
and
in
the
way
of
everything
else
,
though
make
a
great
show
of
navigation
,
when
all
of
a
sudden
,
a
little
coaly
steam
-
tug
will
bear
down
upon
it
,
take
it
in
tow
,
and
bustle
off
with
it
;
similarly
the
cumbrous
Patriarch
have
be
take
in
tow
by
the
snort
Pancks
,
and
be
now
follow
in
the
wake
of
that
dingy
little
craft
.
   
<EOS>
the
return
of
Mr
Casby
with
his
daughter
Flora
,
put
an
end
to
these
meditation
.
 
<EOS>
Clennam
's
eye
no
sooner
fall
upon
the
subject
of
his
old
passion
than
it
shiver
and
break
to
piece
.
   
<EOS>
Most
man
will
be
find
sufficiently
true
to
themselves
to
be
true
to
an
old
idea
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
proof
of
an
inconstant
mind
,
but
<EOS>
exactly
the
opposite
,
when
the
idea
will
not
bear
close
comparison
with
the
reality
,
and
the
contrast
be
a
fatal
shock
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
such
be
Clennam
's
case
.
 
<EOS>
in
his
youth
he
have
ardently
love
this
woman
,
and
have
heap
upon
her
all
the
lock
-
up
wealth
of
his
affection
and
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
that
wealth
have
be
,
in
his
desert
home
,
like
Robinson
Crusoe
's
money
;
exchangeable
with
no
one
,
lie
idle
in
the
dark
to
rust
,
until
he
pour
it
out
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
ever
since
that
memorable
time
,
though
he
have
,
until
the
night
of
his
arrival
,
as
completely
dismiss
her
from
any
association
with
his
Present
or
Future
as
if
she
have
be
dead
(
which
she
may
easily
have
be
for
anything
he
know
)
,
he
have
keep
the
old
fancy
of
the
Past
unchanged
,
in
its
old
sacred
place
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
,
after
all
,
the
last
of
the
Patriarchs
coolly
walk
into
the
parlour
,
say
in
effect
,
"
be
good
enough
to
throw
it
down
and
dance
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
Flora
.
"
   
<EOS>
Flora
,
always
tall
,
have
grow
to
be
very
broad
too
,
and
short
of
breath
;
but
that
be
not
much
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
,
whom
he
have
leave
a
lily
,
have
become
a
peony
;
but
that
be
not
much
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
,
who
have
seem
enchanting
in
all
she
say
and
think
,
be
diffuse
and
silly
.
<EOS>
that
be
much
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
,
who
have
be
spoil
and
artless
long
ago
,
be
determine
to
be
spoil
and
artless
now
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
a
fatal
blow
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
Flora
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
"
giggle
Flora
,
toss
her
head
with
a
caricature
of
her
girlish
manner
,
such
as
a
mummer
may
have
present
at
her
own
funeral
,
if
she
have
live
and
die
in
classical
antiquity
,
"
I
be
ashamed
to
see
Mr
Clennam
,
I
be
a
mere
fright
<EOS>

through
all
the
old
performance
---
now
,
when
the
stage
be
dusty
,
when
the
scenery
be
fade
,
when
the
youthful
actor
be
dead
,
when
the
orchestra
be
empty
,
when
the
light
be
out

and
still
,
through
all
this
grotesque
revival
of
what
he
remember
as
have
once

prettily
natural
to
her
,
he
could
not
but
feel
that
it
revive
at
sight
of
him
,
and
that
there
be
a
tender
memory
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
the
Patriarch
insist
on
his
staying
to
dinner
,
and
Flora
signal
"
yes
!
"
 
<EOS>
Clennam
so
wish
he
could
have
do
more
than
stay
to
dinner
---
so
heartily
wish
he
could
have
find
the
Flora
that
have
be
,
or
that
never
have
be
---
that
he
think
the
least
atonement
he
could
make
for
the
disappointment
he
almost
feel
ashamed
of
,
be
to
give
himself
up
to
the
family
desire
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
he
stay
to
dinner
.
   
<EOS>
panck
dine
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
panck
steam
out
of
his
little
dock
at
a
quarter
before
six

and
bear
straight
down
for
the
Patriarch
,
who
happen
to
be
then
drive
,
in
an
inane
manner
,
through
a
stagnant
account
of
Bleeding
Heart
Yard

<EOS>
Pancks
instantly
make
fast
to
him
and
haul
him
out

<EOS>
"
Bleeding

panck
,
with
a
puff
and
a
snort

<EOS>
"
It
be
a
troublesome
property

<EOS>
do
not
pay
you
badly

very
hard

You

<EOS>
just
as
the
big

the
credit

with
most
spectator

the
powerful
object

so
the

indeed

Clennam

impression

gleam

polished
head

You

Pancks

one

out

grey
pocket

you

his

<EOS>
Mr

here
make
a
singular
and
startling
noise

produce
by
a
strong
blowing
effort

the
nose

unattende
by

that
acoustic
one

"
You

Clennam

doubtful

of

pretty

"
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
fourth
and
most
original
figure
in
the
patriarchal
tent
,
who
also
appear
before
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
an
amazing
little
old
woman
,
with
a
face
like
a
stare
wooden
doll
too
cheap
for
expression
,
and
a
stiff
yellow
wig
perch
unevenly
on
the
top
of
her
head
,
as
if
the
child
who
own
the
doll
have
drive
a
tack
through
it
anywhere
,
so
that
it
only
get
fasten
on
.
 
<EOS>
another
remarkable
thing
in
this
little
old
woman
be
,
that
the
same
child
seem
to
have
damage
her
face
in
two
or
three
place
with
some
blunt
instrument
in
the
nature
of
a
spoon
;
her
countenance
,
and
particularly
the
tip
of
her
nose
,
present
the
phenomenon
of
several
dint
,
generally
answer
to
the
bowl
of
that
article
.
 
<EOS>
a
further
remarkable
thing
in
this
little
old
woman
be
,
that
she
have
no
name
<EOS>
but
Mr
F
's
Aunt
.
   
<EOS>
She
break
upon
the
visitor
's
view
under
the
follow
circumstance
:
Flora
say
when
the
first
dish
be
be
put
on
the
table
,
perhaps
Mr
Clennam
may
not
have
hear
that
Mr
F
have
leave
her
a
legacy
?
 
<EOS>
Clennam
in
return
imply
his
hope
that
Mr
F
have
endow
the
wife
whom
he
adore
,
with
the
great
part
of
his
worldly
substance
,
if
not
with
all
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
say
,
oh
yes
,
she
do
not
mean
that
,
Mr
F
have
make
a
beautiful
will
,
but
he
have
leave
her
as
a
separate
legacy
,
his
Aunt
.
 
<EOS>
She
then
go
out
of
the
room
to
fetch
the
legacy
,
and
,
on
her
return
,
rather
triumphantly
present
"
Mr
F
's
Aunt
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
major
characteristic
discoverable
by
the
stranger
in
Mr
F
's
Aunt
,
be
extreme
severity
and
grim
taciturnity
;
sometimes
interrupt
by
a
propensity
to
offer
remark
in
a
deep
warning
voice
,
which
,
be
totally
uncalled
for
by
anything
say
by
anybody
,
and
traceable
to
no
association
of
idea
,
confound
and
terrify
the
Mind
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
F
's
Aunt
may
have
throw
in
these
observation
on
some
system
of
her
own
,
and
it
may
have
be
ingenious
,
or
even
subtle
:
but
the
key
to
it
be
want
.
<EOS>
the
neatly
-
serve
and
well
-
cook
dinner
(
for
everything
about
the
patriarchal
household
promote
quiet
digestion
)
begin
with
some
soup
,
some
fry
sol
,
a
butter
-
boat
of
shrimp
sauce
,
and
a
dish
of
potato
.
 
<EOS>
the
conversation
still
turn
on
the
receipt
of
rent
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
F
's
Aunt
,
after
regard
the
company
for
ten
minute
with
a
malevolent
gaze
,
deliver
the
follow
fearful
remark
:
   
<EOS>
"
when
we
live
at
Henley
,
Barnes
's
gander
be
steal
by
tinker
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
courageously
nod
his
head
and
say
,
"
all
right
,
madam
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
the
effect
of
this
mysterious
communication
upon
Clennam
be
absolutely
to
frighten
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
another
circumstance
invest
this
old
lady
with
peculiar
terror
.
 
<EOS>
though
she
be
always
stare
,
she
never
acknowledge
that
she
see
any
individual
.
   
<EOS>
the
polite
and
attentive
stranger
would
desire
,
say
,
to
consult
her
inclination
on
the
subject
of
potato
.
 
<EOS>
His
expressive
action
would
be
hopelessly
lose
upon
her
,
and
what
could
he
do
?
 
<EOS>
no
man
could
say
,
"
Mr
F
's
Aunt
,
will
you
permit
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
every
man
retire
from
the
spoon
,
as
Clennam
do
,
cow
and
baffle
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
mutton
,
a
steak
,
and
an
apple
-
pie
---
nothing
in
the
remote
way
connect
with
gander
---
and
the
dinner
go
on
like
a
disenchanted
feast
,
as
it
truly
be
.
 
<EOS>
once
upon
a
time
Clennam
have
sit
at
that
table
take
no
heed
of
anything
<EOS>
but
Flora
<EOS>
;
now
the
principal
heed
he
take
of
Flora
be
to
observe
,
against
his
will
,
that
she
be
very
fond
of
porter
,
that
she
combine
a
great
deal
of
sherry
with
sentiment
,
and
that
if
she
be
a
little
overgrown
,
it
be
upon
substantial
ground
.
 
<EOS>
the
last
of
the
Patriarchs
have
always
be
a
mighty
eater
,
and
he
dispose
of
an
immense
quantity
of
solid
food
with
the
benignity
of
a
good
soul
who
be
feed
some
one
else
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
,
who
be
always
in
a
hurry
,
and
who
refer
at
interval
to
a
little
dirty
notebook
which
he
keep
beside
him
(
perhaps
contain
the
name
of
the
defaulter
he
mean
to
look
up
by
way
of
dessert
)
,
take
in
his
victual
much
as
if
he
be
coal
;
with
a
good
deal
of
noise
,
a
good
deal
of
drop
about
,
and
a
puff
and
a
snort
occasionally
,
as
if
he
be
nearly
ready
to
steam
away
.
   
<EOS>
all
through
dinner
,
Flora
combine
her
present
appetite
for
eat
and
drink
with
her
past
appetite
for
romantic
love
,
in
a
way
that
make
Clennam
afraid
to
lift
his
eye
from
his
plate
;
since
he
could
not
look
towards
her
without
receive
some
glance
of
mysterious
meaning
or
warning
,
as
if
they
be
engage
in
a
plot
.
<EOS>
Mr
F
's
Aunt
sit
silently
defy
him
with
an
aspect
of
the
great
bitterness
,
until
the
removal
of
the
cloth
and
the
appearance
of
the
decanter
,
when
she
originate
another
observation
---
strike
into
the
conversation
like
a
clock
,
without
consult
anybody
.
   
<EOS>
Flora
have
just
say
,
"
Mr
Clennam
,
will
you
give
me
a
glass
of
port
for
Mr
F
's
Aunt
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
the
Monument
near
London

,
"
<EOS>
that
lady
instantly
proclaim
,
"
be
put
up
arter

the
Great
Fire
of
London
;
and
the
Great
Fire
of
London

not
the
fire
in
which
your
uncle
George

down

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
,
with
his
former
courage
,
say
,
"
indeed
,
madam
?
 
<EOS>
all
right
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
appear
to
be
incense
by
imaginary
contradiction
,
or
other
ill
-
usage
,
Mr
F
's
Aunt
,
instead
of
relapse
into
silence
,
make
the
follow
additional
proclamation
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
hate
a
fool
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
impart
to
this
sentiment
,
in
itself
almost
Solomonic
,
so
extremely
injurious
and
personal
a
character
by
level
it
straight
at
the
visitor
's
head
,
that
it
become
necessary
to
lead
Mr
F
's
Aunt
from
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
quietly
do
by
Flora
;
Mr
F
's
Aunt
offer
no
resistance
,
but
inquire
on
her
way
out
,
"
what
he
come
there
for
,
then
?
"
<EOS>
with
implacable
animosity
.
   
<EOS>
when
Flora
return
,
she
explain
that
her
legacy
be
a
clever
old
lady
,
but
be
sometimes
a
little
singular
,
and
"
take
dislikes
"
---
peculiarity
of
which
Flora
seem
to
be
proud
rather
than
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
as
Flora
's
good
nature
shine
in
the
case
,
Clennam
have
no
fault
to
find
with
the
old
lady
for
elicit
it
,
now
that
he
be
relieve
from
the
terror
of
her
presence
;
and
they
take
a
glass
or
two
of
wine
in
peace
.
 
<EOS>
foresee
then
that
the
Pancks
would
shortly
get
under
weigh
,
and
that
the
Patriarch
would
go
to
sleep
<EOS>
,
he
plead
the
necessity
of
visit
his
mother
,
and
ask
Mr
Pancks
in
which
direction
he
be
go
?
   
<EOS>
"
cityward
,
sir
,
"
say
panck
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
we
walk
together
?
"
say
Arthur

<EOS>
"
quite
agreeable
,
"
say
panck

<EOS>
meanwhile
Flora
be
murmur
in
rapid
snatch
for
his
ear
,
that
there
be
a
time
and
that
the
past
be
a
yawn
gulf
however
and
that
a
golden
chain
no
longer
bind
him
and
that
she
revere
the
memory
of
the
late
Mr
F
and
that
she
should
be
at
home
to
-
morrow
at
half
-
past
one
and
that
the
decree
of
Fate
be
beyond
recall
and
that
she
consider
nothing
so
improbable
as
that
he
ever
walk
on
the
north
-
west
side
of
Gray's
-
Inn
Gardens
at
exactly
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
He
try
at
part
to
give
his
hand
in
frankness
to
the
exist
Flora
---
not
the
vanished
Flora
,
or
the
mermaid
---
but
Flora
would
not
have
it
,
could
not
have
it
,
be
wholly
destitute
of
the
power
of
separate
herself
and
him
from
their
bygone
character
.
 
<EOS>
He
leave
the
house
miserably
enough
;
and
so
much
more
light
-
head
than
ever
,
that
if
it
have
not
be
his
good
fortune
to
be
tow
away
,
he
may
,
for
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
,
have
drift
anywhere
.
   
<EOS>
when
he
begin
to
come
to
himself
,
in
the
cooler
air
and
the
absence
of
Flora
,
he
find
panck
at
full
speed
,
crop
such
scanty
pasturage
of
nail
as
he
could
find
,
and
snort
at
interval
.
<EOS>
these
,
in
conjunction
with
one
hand
in
his
pocket
and
his
roughen
hat
hind
side
before
,
be
evidently
the
condition
under
which
he
reflect

"
a
fresh

walk
on

for
ten
minute
without
recall
Flora
.
 
<EOS>
She
necessarily
recall
to
him
his
life
,
with
all
its
misdirection
and
little
happiness
.
   
<EOS>
when
he
get
to
his
lodging
,
he
sit
down
before
the
die
fire
,
as
he
have
stand
at
the
window
of
his
old
room
look
out
upon
the
blacken
forest
of
chimney
,
and
turn
his
gaze
back
upon
the
gloomy
vista
by
which
he
have
come
to
that
stage
in
his
existence
.
<EOS>
so
long
,
so
bare
,
so
blank
.
 
<EOS>
no
childhood
;
no
youth
,
except
for
one
remembrance
;
that
one
remembrance
prove
,
only
that
day
,
to
be
a
piece
of
folly
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
misfortune
to
him
,
trifle
as
it
may
have
be
to
another
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
while
all
that
be
hard
and
stern
in
his
recollection
,
remain
reality
on
be
prove
---
be
obdurate
to
the
sight
and
touch
,
and
relaxed
nothing
of
its
old
indomitable
grimness
---
the
one
tender
recollection
of
his
experience
would
not
bear
the
same
test
,
and
melt
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
foresee
this
,
on
the
former
night
,
when
he
have
dream
with
wake
eye
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
not
feel
it
then
;
and
he
have
now
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
a
dreamer
in
such
wise
,
because
he
be
a
man
who
have
,
deep
-
root
in
his
nature
,
a
belief
in
all
the
gentle
and
good
thing
his
life
have
be
without
.
 
<EOS>
breed
in
meanness
and
hard
dealing
,
this
have
rescue
him
to
be
a
man
of
honourable
mind
and
open
hand
.
 
<EOS>
breed
in
coldness
and
severity
,
this
have
rescue
him
to
have
a
warm
and
sympathetic
heart
.
 
<EOS>
breed
in
a
creed
too
darkly
audacious
to
pursue
,
through
its
process
of
reserve
the
making
of
man
in
the
image
of
his
Creator
to
the
making
of
his
Creator
in
the
image
of
an
err
man
,
this
have
rescue
him
to
judge
not
,
and
in
humility
to
be
merciful
,
and
have
hope
and
charity
.
   
<EOS>
and
this
save
him
still
from
the
whimper
weakness
and
cruel
selfishness
of
hold
that
because
such
a
happiness
or
such
a
virtue
have
not
come
into
his
little
path
,
or
work
well
for
him
,
therefore
it
be
not
in
the
great
scheme
,
but
be
reducible
,
when
find
in
appearance
,
to
the
base
element
.
 
<EOS>
a
disappointed
mind
he
have
,
but
a
mind
too
firm
and
healthy
for
such
unwholesome
air
.
<EOS>
leave
himself
in
the
dark
,
it
could
rise
into
the
light
,
see
it
shine
on
other
and
hail
it
.
   
<EOS>
therefore
,
he
sit
before
his
die
fire
,
sorrowful
to
think
upon
the
way
by
which
he
have
come
to
that
night
,
yet
not
strew
poison
on
the
way
by
which
other
man
have
come
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
should
have
miss
so
much
,
and
at
his
time
of
life
should
look
so
far
about
him
for
any
staff
to
bear
him
company
upon
his
downward
journey
and
cheer
it
<EOS>
,
be
a
just
regret
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
at
the
fire
from
which
the
blaze
depart
,
from
which
the
afterglow
subside
,
in
which
the
ashe
turn
grey
,
from
which
they
drop
to
dust
,
and
think
,
"
how
soon
I
too
shall
pass
through
such
change
,
and
be
go
!
"
   
<EOS>
to
review
his
life
be
like
descend
a
green
tree
in
fruit
and
flower
,
and
see
all
the
branch
wither
and
drop
off
,
one
by
one
,
as
he
come
down
towards
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
from
the
unhappy
suppression
of
my
young
day
,
through
the
rigid
and
unloving

departure

His

It

little

have
a
misgiving
that
he
may
blame

if

She
have
no
belief
that
it
would
have

she
simply
know

by
experience

that
such
delusion
do
sometimes
present

a

directly
:

there

a
glow
of
pride

there

"
say
Little
Dorrit

glance
at
her
charge
,
"
because
I
like
sometimes
to
know
,
of
my
own
knowledge
,
that
my
sister
be
do
well
;
and
like
to
see
her
there
,
with
my
own
eye
,
when
neither
she
nor
Uncle
be
aware
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
seldom
indeed
that
I
can
do
that
,
because
when
I
be
not
out
at
work
,
I
be
with
my
father
,
and
even
when
I
be
out
at
work
,
I
hurry
home
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
pretend
to
-
night
that
I
be
at
a
party
.
"
   
<EOS>
as
she
make
the
confession
,
timidly
hesitating
,
she
raise
her
eye
to
the
face
,
and
read
its
expression
so
plainly
that
she
answer
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
no
,
certainly
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
be
at
a
party
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
pause
a
little
under
his
attentive
look
,
and
then
say
,
"
I
hope
there
be
no
harm
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
never
have
be
of
any
use
,
if
I
have
not
pretend
a
little
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
fear
that
he
be
blame
her
in
his
mind
for
so
devise
to
contrive
for
them
,
think
for
them
,
and
watch
over
them
,
without
their
knowledge
or
gratitude
;
perhaps
even
with
their
reproach
for
suppose
neglect
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
be
really
in
his
mind
,
be
the
weak
figure
with
its
strong
purpose
,
the
thin
wear
shoe
,
the
insufficient
dress
,
and
the
pretence
of
recreation
and
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
He
ask
where
the
suppositious
party
be
?
 
<EOS>
at
a
place
where
she
work
,
answer
Little
Dorrit
,
blushing
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
say
very
little
about
it
;
only
a
few
word
to
make
her
father
easy
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
do
not
believe
it
to
be
a
grand
party
---
indeed
he
may
suppose
that
.
<EOS>
and
she
glance
for
an
instant
at
the
shawl
she
wear
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
first
night
,
"

Little
Dorrit
,
"
that
I
have
ever
be
away
from

London
look

large

so
barren

so
wild

"
 
<EOS>
in
Little
Dorrit
's
eye

its
vastness
under
the
black
sky
be
awful

tremor

over
her

she

the
word

"
<EOS>

this
be
not

with

quiet

again

My

round

no

not

<EOS>
in
Little

eye

the
outside
of
that
window

be
a
distant
star

this

She
have
toil
out

tired

troubled

to
look
up

wonder
about
the

far
off

protector

Clennam

her
agitation
away

make
the
blaze
shine
upon
her

and
put
wine

cake

fruit
towards
her
on

I

Little

"
<EOS>
this
be
the
second
thing

sir

I
think
Mrs

must
have
find
out
my
secret

must
know
where
I
come
from

where
I
go
to

indeed

return
Clennam
quickly

<EOS>
He
ask
her
,
after
short
consideration
,
why
she
suppose
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
reply
little
Dorrit
,
"
that
Mr
Flintwinch
must
have
watch
me

<EOS>
and
why
,
Clennam
ask
,
as
he
turn
his
eye
upon
the
fire
,
bend
his
brow
,
and
consider
again
;
why
do
she
suppose
that
?
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
meet
him
twice
.
 
<EOS>
both
time
near
home

<EOS>
both
time
at
night
,
when
I
be
go
back

<EOS>
both
time
I
think
(
though
that
may
easily
be
my
mistake

,
that
he
hardly
look

meet
me
by
accident

"
<EOS>
"
do
he
say
anything
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
no

he
only
nod

on

side

<EOS>
"
the

take
his

He
rouse
himself
to
persuade
her
to
put
some
wine
to
her
lip
,
and
to
touch
something
to
eat
---
it
be
very
difficult
,
she
be
so
timid

shy

and
then
say
,
muse
again
:

be
my

you

<EOS>
"
oh
,
not
at

She

just
the

I
wonder

I
have
better

my

I
wonder
whether
I

I
mean

whether
you
would

I
wonder

Little

look
at
him
in

suppliant
way

gradually
withdraw
her
eye

what
I

<EOS>
"
little

Clennam
;
and
the
phrase
have
already
begin

between

two
,
to
stand
for
a
hundred
gentle
phrase
,
accord
to
the
varying
tone
and
connection
in
which
it
be
use

do
nothing

I
will
have
some
talk

in
his
compassion

in
his
habit
of
consider
her
a
child
apart
from
the
rest
of

It
be
a
chill
dark
night

with
a
damp
wind
blow
,
when
they
come
out
into
the
lead
street
again
,
and
hear
the
clock
strike
half
-
past
one

<EOS>
"
in

five
hour

to
speak

natural
sequence

<EOS>
They
go
to
the
closed
gate

peep
through
into

court

yard

asleep

"
   
<EOS>
the
gate
be
so
familiar
,

so
like
a
companion
,
that
they
put
down
Maggy
's
basket
in
a
corner
to
serve
for
a
seat
,

keep
close
together
,
rest
there
for
some
time

<EOS>
while
the
street
be
empty

silent

Little
Dorrit
be
not
afraid

when
she
hear
a
footstep
at
a
distance

see
a
move
shadow
among

street
lamp
,
she
be
startle
,
and
whisper
,
"
Maggy
,
I
see
some
one
.
<EOS>
come
away
!
"
 
<EOS>
Maggy
would
then
wake
up
more
or
less
fretfully
,
and
they
would
wander
about
a
little
,
and
come
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
as
long
as
eat
be
a
novelty
and
an
amusement

Maggy
keep
up
pretty
well

but
that
period
go
by

she
become
querulous
about
the
cold

shiver
and
whimper

"
It

soon
be
over

at

in

lay
the
heavy
head
upon

<EOS>
and
thus
she
sit
at

alone

look
up
at
the
star

see
the
cloud

<EOS>
on
a
wintry
afternoon
at
twilight
,
Mrs

,
have
be
heavy
all
day
,
dream
this
dream
:
   
<EOS>
She
think
she
be
in
the
kitchen
get
the
kettle
ready
for
tea
,
and
be
warm
herself
with
her
foot
upon
the
fender
and
the
skirt
of
her
gown
tuck
up
,
before
the
collapse
fire
in
the
middle
of
the
grate
,
border
on
either
hand
by
a
deep
cold
black
ravine
.
 
<EOS>
She
think
that
as
she
sit
thus
,
muse
upon
the
question
whether
life
be
not
for
some
people
a
rather
dull
invention
,
she
be
frighten
by
a
sudden
noise
behind
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
think
that
she
have
be
similarly
frightened
once
last
week
,
and
that
the
noise
be
of
a
mysterious
kind
---
a
sound
of
rustling
and
of
three
or
four
quick
beat
like
a
rapid
step
;
while
a
shock
or
tremble
be
communicate
to
her
heart
,
as
if
the
step
have
shake
the
floor
,
or
even
as
if
she
have
be
touch
by
some
awful
hand
.
 
<EOS>
She
think
that
this
revive
within
her
certain
old
fear
of
her
that
the
house
be
haunt
;
and
that
she
fly
up
the
kitchen
stair
without
know
how
she
get
up
,
to
be
nearer
company
.
   
<EOS>
Mistress
Affery
think
that
on
reach
the
hall
,
she
see
the
door
of
her
liege
lord
's
office
stand
open
,
and
the
room
empty
.
 
<EOS>
that
she
go
to
the
rip
-
up
window
in
the
little
room
by
the
street
door
to
connect
her
palpitate
heart
,
through
the
glass
,
with
live
thing
beyond
and
outside
the
haunt
house
.
 
<EOS>
that
she
then
see
,
on
the
wall
over
the
gateway
,
the
shadow
of
the
two
clever
one
in
conversation
above
.
 
<EOS>
that
she
then
go
up
-
stair
with
her
shoe
in
her
hand
,
partly
to
be
near
the
clever
one
as
a
match
for
most
ghost
,
and
partly
to
hear
what
they
be
talk
about
.
   
<EOS>
"
none

Mrs

dream

the
old

seem
to

so

there
be
another

alter

I

He

on
certain
occasion

generally
at
about
the
quiet
hour
towards

time

when

suddenly
dart
out
of
her
dim
corner

and
whisper
with
a
face
of
terror
to
Mr

the

would
have
cease

snarl

turn
upon

down
that

make
his
inheritance
a
source
of
great
anxiety
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
as
often
as
he
begin
to
consider
how
to
increase
this
inheritance
,
or
to
lay
it
by
,
so
often
his
misgive
that
there
be
some
one
with
an
unsatisfied
claim
upon
his
justice
,
return
;
and
that
alone
be
a
subject
to
outlast
the
long
walk
.
 
<EOS>
again
,
there
be
the
subject
of
his
relation
with
his
mother
,
which
be
now
upon
an
equable
and
peaceful
but
never
confidential
footing
,
and
whom
he
see
several
time
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
little
Dorrit
be
a
leading
and
a
constant
subject
:
for
the
circumstance
of
his
life
,
unite
to
those
of
her
own
story
,
present
the
little
creature
to
him
as
the
only
person
between
whom
and
himself
there
be
tie
of
innocent
reliance
on
one
hand
,
and
affectionate
protection
on
the
other
;
tie
of
compassion
,
respect
,
unselfish
interest
,
gratitude
,
and
pity
.
<EOS>
think
of
her
,
and
of
the
possibility
of
her
father
's
release
from
prison
by
the
unbarring
hand
of
death
---
the
only
change
of
circumstance
he
could
foresee
that
may
enable
him
to
be
such
a
friend
to
her
as
he
wish
to
be
,
by
alter
her
whole
manner
of
life
,
smooth
her
rough
road
,
and
give
her
a
home
---
he
regard
her
,
in
that
perspective
,
as
his
adopt
daughter
,
his
poor
child
of
the
Marshalsea
hush
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
if
there
be
a
last
subject
in
his
thought
,
and
it
lie
towards
Twickenham
,
its
form
be
so
indefinite
that
it
be
little
more
than
the
pervading
atmosphere
in
which
these
other
subject
float
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
cross
the
heath
and
be
leave
it
behind
when
he
gain
upon
a
figure
which
have
be
in
advance
of
him
for
some
time
,
and
which
,
as
he
gain
upon
it
,
he
think
he
know
.
 
<EOS>
He
derive
this
impression
from
something
in
the
turn
of
the
head
,
and
in
the
figure
's
action
of
consideration
,
as
it
go
on
at
a
sufficiently
sturdy
walk
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
the
man
---
for
it
be
a
man
's
figure
---
push
his
hat
up
at
the
back
of
his
head
,
and
stop
to
consider
some
object
before
him
,
he
know
it
to
be
Daniel
Doyce

"
how

I

Daniel

<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
hear
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
be
soon
quite
intimate
,
and
lighten
the
way
with
a
variety
of
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
the
ingenious
culprit
be
a
man
of
great
modesty
and
good
sense
;
and
,
though
a
plain
man
,
have
be
too
much
accustomed
to
combine
what
be
original
and
daring
in
conception
with
what
be
patient
and
minute
in
execution
,
to
be
by
any
mean
an
ordinary
man
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
at
first
difficult
to
lead
him
to
speak
about
himself
,
and
he
put
off
Arthur
's
advance
in
that
direction
by
admit
slightly
,
<EOS>
oh
yes
,
he
have
do
this
,
and
he
have
do
that
,
and
such
a
thing
be
of
his
making
,
and
such
another
thing
be
his
discovery
,
but
it
be
his
trade
,
you
see
,
his
trade
;
until
,
as
he
gradually
become
assured
that
his
companion
have
a
real
interest
in
his
account
of
himself
,
he
frankly
yield
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
then
it
appear
that
he
be
the
son
of
a
north
-
country
blacksmith
,
and
have
originally
be
apprentice
by
his
widow
mother
to
a
lock
-
maker
;
that
he
have
"
strike
out
a
few
little
thing
"
at
the
lock
-
maker
's
,
which
have
lead
to
his
be
release
from
his
indenture
with
a
present
,
which
present
have
enable
him
to
gratify
his
ardent
wish
to
bind
himself
to
a
work
engineer
,
under
whom
he
have
labour
hard
,
learn
hard
,
and
live
hard
,
seven
year
.
 
<EOS>
His
time
be
out
,
he
have
"
work
in
the
shop
"
at
weekly
wage
seven
or
eight
year
more
;
and
have
then
betake
himself
to
the
bank
of
the
Clyde
,
where
he
have
study
,
and
file
,
and
hammer
,
and
improve
his
knowledge
,
theoretical
and
practical
,
for
six
or
seven
year
more
.
 
<EOS>
there
he
have
have
an
offer
to
go
to
Lyons
,
which
he
have
accept
;
and
from
lyon
have
be
engage
to
go
to
Germany
,
and
in
Germany
have
have
an
offer
to
go
to
St
Petersburg
,
and
there
have
do
very
well
indeed
---
never
well
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
have
naturally
feel
a
preference
for
his
own
country
,
and
a
wish
to
gain
distinction
there
,
and
to
do
whatever
service
he
could
do
,
there
rather
than
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
he
have
come
home
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
at
home
he
have
establish
himself
in
business
,
and
have
invent
and
execute
,
and
work
his
way
on
,
until
,
after
a
dozen
year
of
constant
suit
and
service
,
he
have
be
enrol
in
the
Great
british
Legion

<EOS>
"
it
be
much
to

say
Clennam

that
you
ever
turn
your

<EOS>

true

true
to

what
be

to
do
?
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
the
misfortune
to
strike
out
something
serviceable
to
the

he
must
follow
where
it

have
not

He

shake
his

It
be
not
put
into

It
be
put
into

make
useful

You
hold
your

on
the
condition

to
the

you
shall
struggle
hard
for
it

every

that
be
to

say
Arthur

with
a
grow
admiration
of
his

"
you
be
not
finally
discourage
even
now

I

the

<EOS>
when
they
have
walk
a
little
way
in
silence
,
Clennam
,
at
once
to
change
the
direct
point
of
their
conversation
and
not
to
change
it
too
abruptly
,
ask
Mr
Doyce
if
he
have
any
partner
in
his
business
to
relieve
him
of
a
portion
of
its
anxiety
?
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
he
return
,

not
at

<EOS>
I
have
when
I
first
enter
on
it
,
and
a
good
man
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
be
dead
some
year
;
and
<EOS>
as
I
could
not
easily
take
to
the
notion
of
another
when
I
lose
him
,
I
buy
his
share
for
myself
and
have
go
on
by
myself
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
and
here
be
another
thing
,
"
he
say
,
stop
for
a
moment
with
a
good
-
humoured
laugh
in
his
eye
,
and
lay
his
closed
right
hand
,
with
its
peculiar
suppleness
of
thumb
,
on
Clennam
's
arm
,
"
no
inventor
can
be
a
man
of
business
,
you
know

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
?
"
say
Clennam

<EOS>
"
why
,
so
the
man

business
say
,

he
answer
,
resume
the
walk
and
laugh
outright
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
why
we
unfortunate

should
be
suppose
to
want
common

it
be
generally

for

that
we
do

even
the

in

yonder

nod
towards
Twickenham
,

extend
a

<EOS>
Arthur
Clennam
could
not

join
in
the
good

humoured

he
recognise
the
truth
of
the
description

<EOS>
so
I
find
that

a

invention

Daniel
Doyce

off

to
uphold

I
do
not
think

will
find
that
I

be
very
remiss

confuse
in
my

You

<EOS>
"
no
,
sir

no

<EOS>
I
have
only
just
come
to
a
decision

take
one
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
there
be
more
to
do
than
there
use
to
be

and
the
Works
be
enough
for
me
as
I
grow
old

<EOS>
what
with
the
book

correspondence
,
and
foreign
journey
for
which
a
principal
be
necessary

I
can
not
do
all

<EOS>
I
be
go
to
talk
over
the
good
way
of
negotiate
the
matter
,
if
I
find
a
spare
half
-
hour
between
this
and
Monday
morning
,
with
my
---
my
Nurse
and
protector

Doyce
,
with
laugh
eye
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
sagacious
man
in
business
,
and
have
have
a
good
apprenticeship
to
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
after
this
,
they
converse
on
different
subject
until
they
arrive
at
their
journey
's
end
.
 
<EOS>
a
composed
and
unobtrusive
self
-
sustainment
be
noticeable
in
Daniel
Doyce
---
a
calm
knowledge
that
what
be
true
must
remain
true
,
in
spite
of
all
the
Barnacles
in
the
family
ocean
,
and
would
be
just
the
truth
,
and
neither
more
nor
less
when
even
that
sea
have
run
dry
---
which
have
a
kind
of
greatness
in
it
,
though
not
of
the
official
quality
.
   
<EOS>
as
he
know
the
house
well
,
he
conduct
Arthur
to
it
by
the
way
that
show
it
to
the
good
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
charming
place
(
none
the
bad
for
be
a
little
eccentric
)
,
on
the
road
by
the
river
,
and
just
what
the
residence
of
the
Meagles
family
ought
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
stand
in
a
garden
,
no
doubt
as
fresh
and
beautiful
in
the
May
of
the
year
as
Pet
now
be
in
the
May
of
her
life
;
and
it
be
defend
by
a
goodly
show
of
handsome
tree
and
spread
evergreen
,
as
Pet
be
by
Mr

Mrs
Meagles

<EOS>
It
be
make
out
of
an
old
brick
house
,
of
which
a
part
have
be
altogether
pull
down
,
and
another
part
have
be
change
into
the
present
cottage
;
so
there
be
a
hale
elderly
portion
,
to
represent
Mr
and
Mrs
Meagles
,
and
a
young
picturesque
,
very
pretty
portion
to
represent
Pet
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
even
the
later
addition
of
a
conservatory

itself
against
it

uncertain
of
hue
in
its
deep

stain
glass
,
and
in
its
more
transparent
portion
flash
to
the
sun
's
ray
,
now
like
fire
and
now
like
harmless
water
drop
;
which
may
have
stand
for
Tattycoram

<EOS>
within
view
be
the
peaceful
river

the

you

thus

swell
into
what

it
will

thus
play
the
ripple
water
on
the
prow
of
the
ferry

boat
ever
the

tune

<EOS>
year
after
year

so
much

the
drifting

the
boat

so
many
mile
an

the

Clennam
could
not

speculate

as
he
seat
himself
in

room
by
the
fire
,
whether
there
may
be
in
the
breast
of
this
honest
,
affectionate
,
and
cordial
Mr

,
any
microscopic
portion
of
the
mustard
-
seed
that
have
spring
up
into
the
great
tree
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
.
 
<EOS>
His
curious
sense
of
a
general
superiority
to
Daniel
Doyce
,
which
seem
to
be
found
,
not
so
much
on
anything
in
Doyce
's
personal
character
as
on
the
mere
fact
of
his
be
an
originator
and
a
man
out
of
the
beaten
track
of
other
man
,
suggest
the
idea
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
have
occupy
him
until
he
go
down
to
dinner
an
hour
afterwards
,
if
he
have
not
have
another
question
to
consider
,
which
have
be
in
his
mind
so
long
ago
as
before
he
be
in
quarantine
at
Marseilles
,
and
which
have
now
return
to
it
,
and
be
very
urgent
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
no
less
a
question
than
this
:
whether
he
should
allow
himself
to
fall
in
love
with
Pet
?
   
<EOS>
He
be
twice
her
age
.
 
<EOS>
(
He
change
the
leg
he
have
cross
over
the
other
,
and
try
the
calculation
again
,
but
could
not
bring
out
the
total
at
less
.
)
<EOS>
He
be
twice
her
age
.
 
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
He
be
young
in
appearance
,
young
in
health
and
strength
,
young
in
heart
.
 
<EOS>
a
man
be
certainly
not
old
at
forty
;
and
many
man
be
not
in
circumstance
to
marry
,
or
do
not
marry
,
until
they
have
attain
that
time
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
the
question
be
,
not
what
he
think
of
the
point
,
but
what
she
think
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
He
believe
that
Mr
Meagles
be
dispose
to
entertain
a
ripe
regard
for
him
,
and
he
know
that
he
have
a
sincere
regard
for
Mr
Meagles
and
his
good
wife
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
foresee
that
to
relinquish
this
beautiful
only
child
,
of
whom
they
be
so
fond
,
to
any
husband
,
would
be
a
trial
of
their
love
which
perhaps
they
never
yet
have
have
the
fortitude
to
contemplate
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
more
beautiful
and
win
and
charm
she
,
the
nearer
they
must
always
be
to
the
necessity
of
approach
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
why
not
in
his
favour
,
as
well
as
in
another
be
?
   
<EOS>
when
he
have
get
so
far
,
it
come
again
into
his
head
that
the
question
be
,
not
what
they
think
of
it
,
but
what
she
think
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
Arthur
Clennam
be
a
retire
man
,
with
a
sense
of
many
deficiency
;
and
he
so
exalt
the
merit
of
the
beautiful
Minnie
in
his
mind
,
and
depress
his
own
,
that
when
he
pin
himself
to
this
point
,
his
hope
begin
to
fail
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
to
the
final
resolution
,
as
he
make
himself
ready
for
dinner
,
that
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
fall
in
love
with
Pet
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
only
five
,
at
a
round
table
,
and
it
be
very
pleasant
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
so
many
place
and
people
to
recall
,
and
they
be
all
so
easy
and
cheerful
together

(
Daniel

either
sit
out

little

She
say
it
in

half
playfully

petulantly

disagreeably

hour
as
he
walk
up
the
little
lane
by
which
the
garden
-
gate
be
approach
.
 
<EOS>
the
moment
he
pull
the
bell
a
deep
loud
barking
assail
him
from
within
the
wall
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hear
no
dog
last
night
,
"
think
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
the
gate
be
open
by
one
of
the
rosy
maid
,
and
on
the
lawn
be
the
Newfoundland
dog
and
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Minnie
be
not
down
yet
,
gentleman
,
"
say
the
blush
portress
,
as
they
all
come
together
in
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
say
to
the
master
of
the
dog
,
"
Mr
Clennam
,
sir
,
"
and
trip
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Odd
enough
,
Mr
Clennam
,
that
we
should
have
meet
just
now
,
"
say
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
upon
which
the
dog
become
mute
.
 
<EOS>
"
allow
me
to
introduce
myself
---
Henry
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
a
pretty
place
this
,
and
look
wonderfully
well
this
morning
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
the
manner
be
easy
,
and
the
voice
agreeable
;
but
still
Clennam
think
,
that
if
he
have
not
make
that
decide
resolution
to
avoid
fall
in
love
with
Pet
,
he
would
have
take
a
dislike
to
this
Henry
Gowan
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
new
to
you
,
I
believe
?
"
say
this
Gowan
,
when
Arthur
have
extoll
the
place
.
"
<EOS>
quite
new
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
acquaintance
with
it
only
yesterday
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
ah
!
 
<EOS>
of
course
this
be
not
its
good
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
It
use
to
look
charming
in
the
spring
,
before
they
go
away
last
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
you
to
have
see
it
then
.
"
   
<EOS>
but
for
that
resolution
so
often
recall
,
Clennam
may
have
wish
him
in
the
crater
of
Mount
Etna
,
in
return
for
this
civility
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
have
the
pleasure
of
see
it
under
many
circumstance
during
the
last
three
year
,
and
it
be
---
a
Paradise
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
(
at
least
it
may
have
be
,
always
except
for
that
wise
resolution
)
like
his
dexterous
impudence
to
call
it
a
Paradise
.
 
<EOS>
He
only
call
it
a
Paradise
because
he
first
see
her
coming
,
and
so
make
her
out
within
her
hearing
to
be
an
angel
,
Confusion
to
him
!
<EOS>
and
ah
!
 
<EOS>
how
beam
she
look
,
and
how
glad
!
 
<EOS>
how
she
caress
the
dog

how

<EOS>
how
expressive
that
heighten
colour
in
her
face
,
that
fluttered
manner
,
her
downcast
eye
,
her
irresolute
happiness
!
 
<EOS>
when
have
Clennam
see
her
look
like
this
?
<EOS>
not
that
there
be
any
reason
why
he
may
,
could
,
would
,
or
should
have
ever
see
her
look
like
this
,
or
that
he
have
ever
hope
for
himself
to
see
her
look
like
this
;
but
still
---
when
have
he
ever
know
her
do
it
!
   
<EOS>
He
stand
at
a
little
distance
from
them
.
 
<EOS>
this
Gowan
when
he
have
talk
about
a
Paradise
,
have
go
up
to
her
and
take
her
hand
.
<EOS>
the
dog
have
put
his
great
paw
on
her
arm
and
lay
his
head
against
her
dear
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
laugh
and
welcome
them
,
and
make
far
too
much
of
the

far

too
much

that
be

suppose
there
have

<EOS>
She
disengage
herself
now
,
and
come
to
Clennam
,
and
put
her
hand
in
his

wish
him
good
morning
,
and
gracefully
make
as
if
she
would
take
his

into

<EOS>
to
this
Gowan
have
no
objection

<EOS>
no

he
know
he
be
too
safe

<EOS>
there
be
a
pass
cloud
on
Mr

's
good
-
humoured
face
when
they
all
three
(
four

count
the
dog

and
he
be
the
most
objectionable

one
of
the
party

in

breakfast

<EOS>
neither

nor
the
touch

uneasiness
on
Mrs

as
she
direct

be
unobserved
by
Clennam

<EOS>
"
well

Gowan

Mr

even
suppress
a
sigh

I
can
at

guarantee

not

He
will
not

aye

Meagles

We

they

let
me
see

what
relation

this
young

His
lordship
marry

in
seventeen

Lady

no

there
I

that
be
Lady

Lady

be
the
first
daughter

second
marriage
of
the
fifteenth
Earl

with
the
Honourable

<EOS>
very
well

<EOS>
now
this
young
fellow

a
Stiltstalking

<EOS>
---
I
be
get
a
little
too
far
back
,
Gowan
;
I
want
to
make
out
what
relation
<EOS>
this
young
fellow
be
to
Lord
Decimus

"
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
easily
state
.
 
<EOS>
His

"
Nephew

Decimus

"
Mr
Meagles
luxuriously
repeat
with
his
eye
shut
,
that
he
may
have
nothing
to
distract
him
from
the
full
flavour
of
the
genealogical
tree
.
 
<EOS>
"
by
George
,
you
be
right
,
Gowan

so

be

consequently
,
Lord
Decimus
be
his
great
uncle

"
   
<EOS>
"
but
stop
a
bit
!
"
say
Mr
Meagles
,
open
his
eye
with
a
fresh
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
on
the
mother
's
side
,
Lady
Stiltstalking
be
his
great
aunt

of
course
she
be

Mr

with
much
interest

indeed
,
indeed
?
 
<EOS>
We
shall
be
glad
to
see
him

<EOS>
We
will
entertain
him
as
well
as
we
can
,
in
our
humble
way
;
and
we
shall
not
starve
him
,
I
hope
,
at
all
event
.
"
   
<EOS>
in
the
beginning
of
this
dialogue
,
Clennam
have
expect
some
great
harmless
outburst
from
Mr
Meagles
,
like
that
which
have
make
him
burst
out
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
hold
Doyce
by
the
collar
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
good
friend
have
a
weakness
which
none
of
us
nee
go
into
the
next
street
to
find
,
and
which
no
amount
of
circumlocution
experience
could
long
subdue
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
Clennam
look
at
Doyce
;
but
Doyce
know
all
about
it
beforehand
,
and
look
at
his
plate
,
and
make
no
sign
,
and
say
no
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
much
oblige
to
you
,
"
say
Gowan
,
to
conclude
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
Clarence
be
a
great
ass
,
but
he
be
one
of
the
dear
and
good
fellow
that
ever
live
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
appear
,
before
the
breakfast
be
over
,
that
everybody
whom
this
Gowan
know
be
either
more
or
less
of
an
ass
,
or
more
or
less
of
a
knave
;
but
be
,
notwithstanding
,
the
most
lovable
,
the
most
engaging
,
the
simple
,
true
,
kind
,
dear
,
good
fellow
that
ever
live
.
 
<EOS>
the
process
by
which
this
unvarying
result
be
attain
,
whatever
the
premise
,
may
have
be
state
by
Mr
Henry
Gowan
thus
:
"
I
claim
to
be
always
book
-
keeping
,
with
a
peculiar
nicety
,
in
every
man
's
case
,
and
post
up
a
careful
little
account
of
good
and
Evil
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
this
so
conscientiously
,
that
I
be
happy
to
tell
you
I
find
the
most
worthless
of
man
to
be
the
dear
old
fellow
too
:
and
be
in
a
condition
to
make
the
gratifying
report
,
that
there
be
much
less
difference
than
you
be
inclined
to
suppose
between
an
honest
man
and
a
scoundrel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
effect
of
this
cheer
discovery
happen
to
be
,
that
while
he
seem
to
be
scrupulously
find
good
in
most
man
,
he
do
in
reality
lower
it
where
it
be
,
and
set
it
up
where
it
be
not
;
but
that
be
its
only
disagreeable
or
dangerous
feature
.
   
<EOS>
It
scarcely
seem
,
however
,
to
afford
Mr
Meagles
as
much
satisfaction
as
the
Barnacle
genealogy
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
the
cloud
that
Clennam
have
never
see
upon
his
face
before
that
morning
,
frequently
overcast
it
again
;
and
there
be
the
same
shadow
of
uneasy
observation
of
him
on
the
comely
face
of
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
More
than
once
or
twice
when
Pet
caress
the
dog
,
it
appear
to
Clennam
that
her
father
be
unhappy
in
see
her
do
it
;
and
,
in
one
particular
instance
when
Gowan
stand
on
the
other
side
of
the
dog
,
and
bend
his
head
at
the
same
time
,
Arthur
fancy
that
he
see
tear
rise
to
Mr
Meagles
's
eye
as
he
hurry
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
either
the
fact
too
,
or
he
fancy
further
,
that
Pet
herself
be
not
insensible
to
these
little
incident
;
that
she
try
,
with
a
more
delicate
affection
than
usual
,
to
express
to
her
good
father
how
much
she
love
him
;
that
it
be
on
this
account
that
she
fall
behind
the
rest
,
both
as
they
go
to
church
and
as
they
return
from
it
,
and
take
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
swear
but
that
as
he
walk
alone
in
the
garden
afterwards
,
he
have
an
instantaneous
glimpse
of
her
in
her
father
's
room
,
cling
to
both
her
parent
with
the
great
tenderness
,
and
weep
on
her
father
's
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
the
latter
part
of
the
day
turn
out
wet
,
they
be
fain
to
keep
the
house
,
look
over
Mr
Meagles
's
collection
,
and
beguile
the
time
with
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
this
Gowan
have
plenty
to
say
for
himself
,
and
say
it
in
an
off
-
hand
and
amusing
manner
.
 
<EOS>
He
appear
to
be
an
artist
by
profession
,
and
to
have
be
at
Rome
some
time
;
yet
he
have
a
slight
,
careless
,
amateur
way
with
him
---
a
perceptible
limp
,
both
in
his
devotion
to
art
and
his
attainment
---
which
Clennam
could
scarcely
understand
.
   
<EOS>
He
apply
to
Daniel
Doyce
for
help
,
as
they
stand
together
,
look
out
of
window
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
Mr
Gowan
?
<EOS>
"
he
say
in
a
low
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
him
here
.
 
<EOS>
come
here
every
Sunday
when
they
be
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
an
artist
,
I
infer
from
what
he
say
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
a
sort
of
a
one
,
"
say
Daniel
Doyce
,
in
a
surly
tone
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
sort
of
a
one
?
"
ask
Clennam
,
with
a
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
he
have
saunter
into
the
art
at
a
leisurely
Pall
-
Mall
pace
,
"
say
Doyce
,
"
and
I
doubt
if
they
care
to
be
take
quite
so
coolly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
pursue
his
inquiry
,
Clennam
find
that
the
Gowan
family
be
a
very
distant
ramification
of
the
Barnacles
;
and
that
the
paternal
Gowan
,
originally
attach
to
a
legation
abroad
,
have
be
pension
off
as
a
Commissioner
of
nothing
particular
somewhere
or
other
,
and
have
die
at
his
post
with
his
draw
salary
in
his
hand
,
nobly
defend
it
to
the
last
extremity
.
 
<EOS>
in
consideration
of
this
eminent
public
service
,
the
Barnacle
then
in
power
have
recommend
the
Crown
to
bestow
a
pension
of
two
or
three
hundred
a
-
year
on
his
widow
;
to
which
the
next
Barnacle
in
power
have
add
certain
shady
and
sedate
apartment
in
the
Palaces
at
Hampton
Court
,
where
the
old
lady
still
live
,
deplore
the
degeneracy
of
the
time
in
company
with
several
other
old
lady
of
both
sex
.
 
<EOS>
Her
son
,
Mr
Henry
Gowan
,
inherit
from
his
father
,
the
Commissioner
,
that
very
questionable
help
in
life
,
a
very
small
independence
,
have
be
difficult
to
settle
;
the
rather
,
as
public
appointment
chance
to
be
scarce
,
and
his
genius
,
during
his
early
manhood
,
be
of
that
exclusively
agricultural
character
which
apply
itself
to
the
cultivation
of
wild
oat
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
he
have
declare
that
he
would
become
a
painter
;
partly
because
he
have
always
have
an
idle
knack
that
way
,
and
partly
to
grieve
the
soul
of
the
Barnacles
-
in
-
chief
who
have
not
provide
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
so
it
have
come
to
pass
successively
,
first
,
that
several
distinguished
lady
have
be
frightfully
shock
;
then
,
that
portfolio
of
his
performance
have
be
hand
about
o
'
night
,
and
declare
with
ecstasy
to
be
perfect
claude
,
perfect
Cuyps
,
perfect
phaenomena
;
then
,
that
Lord
Decimus
have
buy
his
picture
,
and
have
ask
the
President
and
Council
to
dinner
at
a
blow
,
and
have
say
,
with
his
own
magnificent
gravity
,
"
do
you
know
,
there
appear
to
me
to
be
really
immense
merit
in
that
work
?
"
<EOS>
and
,
in
short
,
that
people
of
condition
have
absolutely
take
pain
to
bring
him
into
fashion
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
somehow
,
it
have
all
fail
.
 
<EOS>
the
prejudiced
public
have
stand
out
against
it
obstinately
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
determine
not
to
admire
Lord
Decimus
's
picture
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
determine
to
believe
that
in
every
service
,
except
their
own
,
a
man
must
qualify
himself
,
by
strive
early
and
late
,
and
by
work
heart
and
soul
,
may
and
main
.
 
<EOS>
so
now
Mr
Gowan
,
like
that
wear
-
out
old
coffin
which
never
be
Mahomet
's
nor
anybody
else
's
,
hung
midway
between
two
point
:
jaundice
and
jealous
as
to
the
one
he
have
leave
:
jaundice
and
jealous
as
to
the
other
that
he
could
not
reach
.
   
<EOS>
such
be
the
substance
of
Clennam
's
discovery
concern
him
,
make
that
rainy
Sunday
afternoon
and
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
about
an
hour
or
so
after
dinner
time
,
Young
Barnacle
appear
,
attend
by
his
eye
-
glass
;
in
honour
of
whose
family
connection
,
Mr
Meagles
have
cashier
the
pretty
parlour
-
maid
for
the
day
,
and
have
place
on
duty
in
their
stead
two
dingy
man
.
 
<EOS>
Young
Barnacle
be
in
the
last
degree
amazed
and
disconcert
at
sight
of
Arthur
,
and
have
murmur
involuntarily
,
"
look
here
!
 
<EOS>
upon
my
soul
,
you
know
!
<EOS>
"
before
his
presence
of
mind
return
.
   
<EOS>
even
then
,
he
be
oblige
to
embrace
the
early
opportunity
of
take
his
friend
into
a
window
,
and
say
,
in
a
nasal
way
that
be
a
part
of
his
general
debility
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
,
Gowan

<EOS>
I
say

<EOS>
look

<EOS>
who

"
   
<EOS>

a

"
   
<EOS>
"
He

Young
Barnacle

<EOS>

<EOS>

"
ecod

into
our
people
the
other
day
in
the
most
tremendous
manner
.
 
<EOS>
go
up
to
our
place
and
pitch
into
my
father
to
that
extent
that
it
be
necessary
to
order
him
out
.
 
<EOS>
come
back
to
our
Department
,
and
pitch
into
me
.
 
<EOS>
look
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
see
such
a

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
what
do
he
want
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
ecod
,
sir
,
"
return
Young
Barnacle
,
"
he
say
he
want
to
know
,
you
know
!
 
<EOS>
pervade
our
Department
---
without
an
appointment
---
and
say
he
want
to
know
!
"
   
<EOS>
the
stare
of
indignant
wonder
with
which
Young
Barnacle
accompany
this
disclosure
,
would
have
strain
his
eye
injuriously
but
for
the
opportune
relief
of
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
(
who
have
be
extremely
solicitous
to
know
how
his
uncle
and
aunt
be
)
beg
him
to
conduct
Mrs
Meagles
to
the
dining
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
he
sit
on
Mrs
Meagles
's
right
hand
,
Mr
Meagles
look
as
gratified
as
if
his
whole
family
be
there
.
   
<EOS>
all
the
natural
charm
of
the
previous
day
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
the
eater
of
the
dinner
,
like
the
dinner
itself
,
be
lukewarm
,
insipid
,
overdone
---
and
all
owe
to
this
poor
little
dull
Young
Barnacle
.
<EOS>
conversationless
at
any
time
,
he
be
now
the
victim
of
a
weakness
special
to
the
occasion
,
and
solely
referable
to
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
under
a
pressing
and
continual
necessity
of
look
at
that
gentleman
,
which
occasion
his
eye
-
glass
to
get
into
his
soup
,
into
his
wine
-
glass
,
into
Mrs
Meagles
's
plate
,
to
hang
down
his
back
like
a
bell
-
rope
,
and
be
several
time
disgracefully
restore
to
his
bosom
by
one
of
the
dingy
man
.
 
<EOS>
weaken
in
mind
by
his
frequent
loss
of
this
instrument
,
and
its
determination
not
to
stick
in
his
eye
,
and
more
and
more
enfeebled
in
intellect
every
time
he
look
at
the
mysterious
Clennam
,
he
apply
spoon
to
his
eye
,
fork
,
and
other
foreign
matter
connect
with
the
furniture
of
the
dinner
-
table
.
 
<EOS>
His
discovery
of
these
mistake
greatly
increase
his
difficulty
,
but
never
release
him
from
the
necessity
of
look
at
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
and
whenever
Clennam
speak
,
this
ill
-
star
young
man
be
clearly
seize
with
a
dread
that
he
be
come
,
by
some
artful
device
,
<EOS>
round
to
that
point
of
want
to
know
,
you
know
.
   
<EOS>
It
may
be
question
,
therefore
,
whether
any
one
but
Mr
Meagles
have
much
enjoyment
of
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
,
however
,
thoroughly
enjoy
Young
Barnacle
.
 
<EOS>
as
a
mere
flask
of
the
golden
water
in
the
tale
become
a
full
fountain
when
it
be
pour
out
,
so
Mr
Meagles
seem
to
feel
that
this
small
spice
of
Barnacle
impart
to
his
table
the
flavour
of
the
whole
family
-
tree
.
 
<EOS>
in
its
presence
,
his
frank
,
fine
,
genuine
quality
pale
;
he
be
not
so
easy
,
he
be
not
so
natural
,
he
be
strive
after
something
that
do
not
belong
to
him
,
he
be
not
himself
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
strange
peculiarity
on
the
part
of
Mr
Meagles
,
and
where
should
we
find
another
such
case
!
   
<EOS>
at
last
the
wet
Sunday
wear
itself
out
in
a
wet
night
;
and
Young
Barnacle
go
home
in
a
cab
,
feebly
smoke
;
and
the
objectionable
Gowan
go
away
on
foot
,
accompany
by
the
objectionable
dog
.
 
<EOS>
Pet
have
take
the
most
amiable
pain
all
day
to
be
friendly
with
Clennam
,
but
Clennam
have
be
a
little
reserved
since
breakfast
<EOS>
---
that
be
to
say
,
would
have
be
,
if
he
have
love
her
.
   
<EOS>
when
he
have
go
to
his
own
room
,
and
have
again
throw
himself
into

by
the

,
Mr

knock
at
the
door
,
candle
in

,
to
ask
him
how
and
at
what
hour
he
propose
return
on
the
morrow
?
 
<EOS>
after
settle
this
question
,
he
say
a
word
to
Mr
Doyce
about
this
Gowan
---
who
would
have
run
in
his
head
a
good
deal
,
if
he
have
be
his
rival
.
   
<EOS>
"
those
be
not
good
prospect

Mr

in

look
hard
at
the
flame
of
his
candle
,
with
a
certain
quiet
perception
in
his
face
that
they
be
go
to
say
something
more
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
our
good
friend
a
little
changed
,
and
out

,
after

<EOS>
"
no

"
say
Doyce

<EOS>
there
be
a
pause
on
both
side
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Doyce
,
still
look
at
the
flame
of
his
candle
,
slowly
resume
:
   
<EOS>
"
the
truth
be
,
he
have
twice
take
his
daughter
abroad
in
the
hope
of
separate
her
from
Mr
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
He
rather
think
she
be
dispose
to
like
him
,
and
he
have
painful
doubt
<EOS>
(
I
quite
agree
with
him
,
as
I
dare
say
you
do
)
of
the
hopefulness
of
such

"

"
there

Clennam
airily

<EOS>
no

as
I

It

none

<EOS>
since
their
recent

our

that

the
utmost

You

cry
Arthur

<EOS>
Mr

wish
him
Good
Night
in
the
tone

a
man

a
mournful

who

<EOS>
such
tone
be
probably
a

his
oddity

as
one

Mrs

from

these

Young

the

his

he
take

on
Sundays

be
glad

sometimes

walk
up

quietly
to
step
out

if

He

of
dispute
their
pretension

but
do
homage
to
the
miserable
mumbo
jumbo
they
parade
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
resent
any
affront
from
her
brother
,
he
would
have
feel
,
even
if
he
have
not
naturally
be
of
a
most
pacific
disposition
,
that
to
wag
his
tongue
or
lift
his
hand
against
that
sacred
gentleman
would
be
an
unhallowed
act
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
sorry
that
his
noble
mind
should
take
offence
;
still
,
he
feel
the
fact
to
be
not
incompatible
with
its
nobility
,
and
seek
to
propitiate
and
conciliate
that
gallant
soul

<EOS>
It
be
an
instinctive
testimony

Little

difference
from

the
rest

that
the

an
expression
in

fright

something

dislike

him
unutterable
dismay

She
have
often
avoid

always

for

She
have
turn
away

glide
off
so
often

see
him
come
toward
her

that
the
unfortunate
Young
John
could
not
think
it
accidental

<EOS>

he
have
hope
that
it
may
be
shyness

her
retire
character

her
foreknowledge

anything
short
of
aversion

<EOS>
there
really
be
a
genuineness
in
the
poor

a
contrast
between
the
hardness

the
softness

of
his

too

Little

entreat
him
to
disparage
neither

above

to
divest
himself
of

<EOS>
but
it

He
be

remonstrate

to
express
his
opinion
that
people

on

have
no

in
manner

in

watch
the
frequent

with
Mr

the

touch

come
to

<EOS>
"
be
so
kind

go
along
the
passage

down

careful

<EOS>
(
I
really
do
not
like
the
notion

so
extremely
liable
to
be
run
over

"
   
<EOS>
with
these
word
,
and
with
a
face
expressive
of
many
uneasy
doubt
and
much
anxious
guardianship
,
he
turn
his
regard
upon
the
assemble
company
in
the
Lodge
:
so
plainly
indicate
that
his
brother
be
to
be
pity
for
not
be
under
lock
and
key
,
that
an
opinion
to
that
effect
go
round
among
the
Collegians
assemble

<EOS>
but
he
do
not
receive
it
with
unqualified
assent
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
say
,
no
,
gentleman
,
no
;
let
them
not
misunderstand
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
brother
Frederick
be
much
broken
,
no
doubt
,
and
it
may
be
more
comfortable
to
himself
(
the
Father
of

Marshalsea
)
to
know
that
he
be
safe
within
the
wall

<EOS>
still
,
it
must
be
remember
that
to
support
an
existence
there
during
many
year
,
require
a
certain
combination
of
quality
---
he
do
not
say
high
quality
,
but
quality

moral
quality
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
have
his
brother
Frederick
that
peculiar
union
of
quality

<EOS>
Gentlemen

excellent
man
,
a
most
gentle
,
tender
,
and
estimable
man

with
the
simplicity
of
a

but
would
he
,
though
unsuite
for
most
other
place
,
do
for
that
place
?
 
<EOS>
no

;
he

no

and
,
he

Heaven
forbid

be
there
in
any

Gentlemen

whoever

no

Misfortune

under
such
circumstance
receive

the
goodness
of
human
nature

the

as

an
uneasiness
stole
over

he
be
open
and
shut
his

like
valve

so
conscious
all
the

of
that
touch

there

once

he
have

pay
his

do
not

admire

the

daughter

the
sister

of
one
of
us
;
a
rather
distinguished
Collegian
;
I
may
say
,
very
much
so
.
 
<EOS>
His
name
be
Captain
Martin
;
and
he
consult
me
on
the
question
whether
It
be
necessary
that
his
daughter

sister

should
hazard
offend
the
turnkey
brother

Captain

be
a

I
put
it

him

me
his

Captain
Martin
(
highly

upon

I
be
doubtful
whether

be
Captain

exact
expression

tolerate

His

die
away

the

hear
him

gradually
creep

for

be

He
burst
into
tear

maudlin
pity
for
himself

at
length
suffer
her
to
embrace
him
and
take
charge
of
him

let
his
grey
head
rest
against
her
cheek

bewail
his

presently
he
change
the

clasp
his

cry

forlorn
child

he
revert

weakly
tell
her
how
much
better
she
would
have
love
him

she
have
know
him
in
his
vanish
character

and
how
he
would
have
marry
her
to
a
gentleman
who
should
have
be
proud
of
her
as
his
daughter
,
and
how
(
at
which
he
cry
again
)
<EOS>
she
should
first
have
ride
at
his
fatherly
side
on
her
own
horse
,
and
how
the
crowd
(
by
which
he
mean
in
effect
the
people
who
have
give
him
the
twelve
shilling
he
then
have
in
his
pocket

should
have
trudge
the
dusty
road
respectfully

thus
,
now
boast

now
despair

in
either
fit

the
impurity
of

grain

his
soul

reveal
his

state

Sunday
night

there
be

though
of

English

do
much
more
,
in
comfort
her
father
's
waste
heart
upon
her
innocent
breast
,
and
turn
to
it
a
fountain
of
love
and
fidelity
that
never
run
dry
or
wane
through
all
his
year
of
famine

She
soothe
him
;
ask
him
for
his
forgiveness
if
she
have
be
,
or
seem
to
have
be

undutiful
;
tell
him
,
Heaven
know
truly
,
that
she
could
not
honour
him
more
if
he
be
the
favourite
of
Fortune
and
the
whole
world
acknowledge
him

when
his
tear
be
dry
,

he
sob
in
his
weakness
no
longer
,

be
free
from
that
touch
of
shame
,

have
recover
his
usual
bearing
,
she
prepare
the
remain
of
his
supper
afresh
,
and
,
sit
by
his
side
,
rejoice
to
see
him
eat
and
drink
.
 
<EOS>
for
now
he
sit
in
his
black
velvet
cap
and
old
grey
gown
,
magnanimous
again
;
and
would
have
comport
himself
towards
any
Collegian
who
may
have
look
in
to
ask
his
advice
,
like
a
great
moral
Lord
Chesterfield
,
or
Master
of
the
ethical
ceremony
of
the
Marshalsea
.
   
<EOS>
to
keep
his
attention
engage
,
she
talk
with
him
about
his
wardrobe
;
when
he
be
pleased
to
say
,
that
yes

those
shirt
she
propose
would
be
exceedingly
acceptable

for
those
he
have
be
wear
out

,
be
ready
-
make
,
have
never
fit
him
.
<EOS>
be
conversational
,
and
in
a
reasonable
flow
of
spirit
,
he
then
invite
her
attention
to
his
coat
as
it
hang
behind
the
door
:
remark
that
the
Father
of
the
place
would
set
an
indifferent
example
to
his
child
,
already
dispose
to
be
slovenly
,
if
he
go
among
them
out
at
elbow
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
jocular
,
too
,
as
to
the
heeling
of
his
shoe
;
but
become
grave
on
the
subject
of
his
cravat
,
and
promise
her
that
,
when
she
could
afford
it
,
she
should
buy
him
a
new
one
.
   
<EOS>
while
he
smoke
out
his
cigar
in
peace
,
she
make
his
bed
,
and
put
the
small
room
in
order
for
his
repose
.
 
<EOS>
be
weary
then
,
owe
to
the
advanced
hour
and
his
emotion
,
he
come
out
of
his
chair
to
bless
her
and
wish
her
good
night
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
time
he
have
never
once
think
of
HER
dress
,
her
shoe
,
her
need
of
anything
.
 
<EOS>
no
other
person
upon

could
have
be
so
unmindful

kiss
her
many
time
with
"
bless
you

my
love

<EOS>
good
night
,

"
   
<EOS>
but
her
gentle
breast
have
be
so
deeply
wound
by
what
she
have
see
of
him
that
she
be
unwilling
to
leave
him
alone
,
lest
he
should
lament
and
despair
again

"

feel
solitary

He
seem
to
be
doze
when
she
return
,
and
she
put
the
low
fire
together
very
softly
lest
she
should
awake

he
overhear
her

He
raise
himself
a
little
in
his
low
bed
,
as
she
kneel
beside
it
to
bring
her
face
near
him
;

put
his

between

for

illustration
out
of

He
would
have
find
it
amply
in

that
dainty

so
steep
in

so
loftily
conscious

Tip
have
turn
his

to
hopeful

by
become
a
billiard

marker

<EOS>
He
have
trouble
himself
so
little
as

the

of

he
become

now
occasionally
look
in

ground
in
a
green
Newmarket
coat
(

hand
)
,
with
a
shine
collar
and
bright
button
(
new
)
,
and
drink
the
beer
of
the
Collegians
.
   
<EOS>
one
solid
stationary
point
in
the
looseness
of
this
gentleman
's
character
be
,
that
he
respect
and
admire
his
sister
Amy
.
 
<EOS>
the
feeling
have
never
induce
him
to
spare
her
a
moment
's
uneasiness
,
or
to
put
himself
to
any
restraint
or
inconvenience
on
her
account
;
but
with
that
marshalsea
taint
upon
his
love
,
he
love
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
same
rank
Marshalsea
flavour
be
to
be
recognise
in
his
distinctly
perceive
that
she
sacrifice
her
life
to
her
father
,
and
in
his
have
no
idea
that
she
have
do
anything
for
himself
.
   
<EOS>
when
this
spirit
young
man
and
his
sister
have
begin
systematically
to
produce
the
family
skeleton
for
the
overawing
of
the
College
,
this
narrative
can
not
precisely
state
.
 
<EOS>
probably
at
about
the
period
when
they
begin
to
dine
on
the
College
charity
.
<EOS>
It
be
certain
that
the
more
reduced
and
necessitous
they
be
,
the
more
pompously
the
skeleton
emerge
from
its
tomb
;
and
that
when
there
be
anything
particularly
shabby
in
the
wind
,
the
skeleton
always
come
out
with
the
ghastly
flourish
.
   
<EOS>
little
Dorrit
be
late
on
the
Monday
morning
,
for
her
father
sleep
late
,
and
afterwards
there
be
his
breakfast
to
prepare
and
his
room
to
arrange
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
no
engagement
to
go
out
to
work
,
however
,
and
therefore
stay
with
him
until
,
with
Maggy
's
help
,
she
have
put
everything
right
about
him
,
and
have
see
him
off
upon
his
morning
walk
(
of
twenty
yard
or
so
)
to
the
coffee
-
house
to
read
the
paper
.
   
<EOS>
She
then
get
on
her
bonnet
and
go
out
,
have
be
anxious
to
get
out
much
sooner
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
,
as
usual
,
a
cessation
of
the
small
-
talk
in
the
Lodge
as
she
pass
through
it
;
and
a
Collegian
who
have
come
in
on
Saturday
night
,
receive
the
intimation
from
the
elbow
of
a
more
seasoned
Collegian
,
"
look
out
.
 
<EOS>
here
she
be
!
"
<EOS>
She
want
to
see
her
sister
,
but
when
she
get
round
to
Mr
Cripples
's
,
she
find
that
both
her
sister
and
her
uncle
have
go
to
the
theatre
where
they
be
engage
.
 
<EOS>
have
take
thought
of
this
probability
by
the
way
,
and
have
settle
that
in
such
case
she
would
follow
them
,
she
set
off
afresh
for
the
theatre
,
which
be
on
that
side
of
the
river
,
and
not
very
far
away
.
   
<EOS>
little
Dorrit
be
almost
as
ignorant
of
the
way
of
theatre
as
of
the
way
of
gold
mine
,
and
when
she
be
direct
to
a
furtive
sort
of
door
,
with
a
curious
up
-
all
-
night
air
about
it
,
that
appear
to
be
ashamed
of
itself
and
to
be
hide
in
an
alley
,
she
hesitate
to
approach
it
;
be
further
deter
by
the
sight
of
some
half
-
dozen
close
-
shave
gentleman
with
their
hat
very
strangely
on
,
who
be
lounge
about
the
door
,
look
not
at
all
unlike
Collegians
.
 
<EOS>
on
her
applying
to
them
,
reassure
by
this
resemblance
,
for
a
direction
to
Miss
Dorrit
,
they
make
way
for
her
to
enter
a
dark
hall
---
it
be
more
like
<EOS>
a
great
grim
lamp
go
out
than
anything
else
---
where
she
could
hear
the
distant
playing
of
music
and
the
sound
of
dance
foot
.
 
<EOS>
a
man
so
much
in
want
of
airing
that
he
have
a
blue
mould
upon
him
,
sit
watch
this
dark
place
from
a
hole
in
a
corner
,
like
a
spider
;
and
he
tell
her
that
he
would
send
a
message
up
to
Miss
Dorrit
by
the
first
lady
or
gentleman
who
go
through
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
lady
who
go
through
have
a
roll
of
music
,
half
in
her
muff
and
half
out
of
it
,
and
be
in
such
a
tumble
condition
altogether
,
that
it
seem
as
if
it
would
be
an
act
of
kindness
to
iron
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
she
be
very
good
-
natured
,
and
say
,
"
come
with
me
;
I
will
soon
find
Miss
Dorrit
for
you
,
"
Miss
Dorrit
's
sister
go
with
her
,
draw
nearer
and
near
at
every
step
she
take
in
the
darkness
to
the
sound
of
music
and
the
sound
of
dance
foot
.
   
<EOS>
at
last
they
come
into
a
maze
of
dust
,
where
a
quantity
of
people
be
tumble
over
one
another
,
and
where
there
be
such
a
confusion
of
unaccountable
shape
of
beam
,
bulkhead
,
brick
wall
,
rope
,
and
roller
,
and
such
a
mixing
of
gaslight
and
daylight
,
that
they
seem
to
have
get
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
pattern
of
the
universe

<EOS>
little
Dorrit
,
leave
to
herself
,
and
knock
against
by
somebody
every
moment

be
quite
bewilder
,
when
she
hear
her
sister

voice
.
   
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
as
her
sister
say
this
in
no
very
cordial
tone
of
welcome
,
she
conduct
her
to
a
more
open
part
of
the
maze
,
where
various
golden
chair
and
table
be
heap
together
,
and
where
a
number
of
young

be
sit
on
anything
they

<EOS>
all
these
young

want
iron

a
curious
way

look
everywhere

they
chatter

<EOS>
just
as
the

arrive
here
,
a
monotonous
boy
in
a
Scotch

put
his

round

It

that
she
be
a
plain
domestic
little
creature

without
the
great
and
sage
experience

this

<EOS>
They
be
soon
leave

;
nothing
more
important
happening

in
the
meantime
,
than
the
boy
look
round
his
old
beam
,
and
say
,
"
everybody

there

Fanny

<EOS>
little
Dorrit
,
as
her
eye
become
use

the
darkness

faintly
make
him
out
at
the
bottom
of
the
well
,
in
an
obscure
corner
by
himself
,
with
his
instrument
in
its
ragged
case
under
his
arm
.
   
<EOS>
the
old
man
look
as
if
the
remote
high
gallery
window
,
with
their
little
strip
of
sky
,
may
have
be
the
point
of
his
well
fortune
,
from
which
he
have
descend
,
until
he
have
gradually
sink
down
below
there
to
the
bottom

<EOS>
He
have
be
in

six
night
a

for
many

have
never

observe
to
raise
his

above
his
music

book

be
confidently
believe
to
have
never

<EOS>
there
be
legend
in
the
place
that
he
do
not
so
much
as

the
popular
hero

and
that
the
low
comedian
have
"

"
at
him
in
his
rich
manner
fifty
night
for
a
wager
,
and
he
have
show
no
trace
of
consciousness
.
<EOS>
the
carpenter
have
a
joke
to
the
effect
that
he
be
dead
without
be
aware
of
it
;
and
the
frequenter
of
the
pit
suppose
him
to
pass
his
whole
life
,
night
and
day
,
and
Sunday
and
all
,
in
the
orchestra
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
try
him
a
few
time
with
pinche
of
snuff
offer
over
the
rail
,
and
he
have
always
respond
to
this
attention
with
a
momentary
waking
up
of
manner
that
have
the
pale
phantom
of
a
gentleman
in
it
:
beyond
this
he
never
,
on
any
occasion
,
have
any
other
part
in
what
be
go
on
than
the
part
write
out
for
the
clarionet
;
in
private
life
,
where
there
be
no
part
for
the
clarionet
,
he
have
no
part
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
some
say
he
be
poor
,
some
say
he
be
a
wealthy
miser
;
but
he
say
nothing
,
never
lift
up
his
bowed
head
,
never
vary
his
shuffling
gait
by
get
his
springless
foot
from
the
ground

<EOS>
though
expect
now
to
be
summon
by
his
niece
,
he
do
not
hear
her
until
she
have
speak
to
him
three
or
four
time
;
nor
be
he
at
all
surprise
by
the
presence
of
two
niece
instead
of
one
,
but
merely
say
in
his
tremulous
voice
,
"
I
be
come
,
I
be
come
!
"
and
creep
forth
by
some
underground
way
which
emit
a
cellarous
smell

<EOS>
and
so
,
Amy

say
her

when
the

pass
out
at

that
have
such
a

face
consciousness

the

instinctively
take
Amy

on

"

Amy

<EOS>
She
be
pretty

conscious

rather
flaunting

the
condescension
with
which
she
put
aside
the
superiority
of
her
charm

of
her
worldly
experience

Fanny

to

I
point
out
to
your

the
plain
state

the
case

the
impossibility
of
the
Society

we
move
recognise
the
Society
in
which
she
move
---
though
charm
,
I
have
no
doubt
;
the
immense
disadvantage
at
which
she
would
consequently
place
the
family
she
have
so
high
an
opinion
of
,
upon
which
we
should
find
ourselves
compel
to
look
down

(

we
should
feel
oblige

mention

before

if
I

perhaps
it
be

my

revert

the
apprehension
I
have
at
the
time
that
he
may
persevere

you
may
have
something
to

I
also
mention
to
your

again

that

have
nothing

finally
,
after

in

if
that
be
it
which
come

to
Mrs

reception

,
he
hardly
seem

Mrs

<EOS>
the

He

not
so
much

<EOS>
He
have
give
so

another

It

the

every
successive
young

to
whom
he
tender
a

a

Mr

many
of

what
we

call
in

way
,
amicus

,
a
fact
that
have
come
by
accident
within
his

.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
require
to
look
over
the
title
of
a
very
considerable
estate
in
one
of
the
eastern

lie
,
in

for
Mr

know
we

love

<EOS>
now
,
the

the

be
to

purchase
by
one
who
have
the

money

this
have
come

it

"
I

this

strictly

I
will
mention
the
opportunity

"
 
<EOS>
such
a
purchase
would
involve
not

a
great
legitimate
political
influence
,
but
some
half

dozen
church
presentation
of
considerable

<EOS>
now
,
that
Mr

be
already
at

even
his

and
of
fully
employ
even
his

<EOS>
bar
well
know

but
he
would
venture
to
suggest
that
the
question
arise
in
his
mind
,
whether
one
who
have
deservedly
gain
so
high
a
position

<EOS>
so
european
a
reputation
do
not
owe
it
---
we
would
not

to

we
would
say
to

to
possess
himself
of
such

these
;

to
exercise
them
---
we
would
not

for
his

we
would
say
for

benefit

<EOS>
Mr

again
express
himself
as
wholly
devoted

Bar
take
his

up
the

<EOS>
Bishop
then
come
undesignedly
sidle
in

<EOS>
surely
the

of

,
it
occur
in
an
accidental

to
Bishop
to
remark
,
could
scarcely

the

judiciously

<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
with
humility
express
his
conviction
that
Bishop
could
not
mean
him
,
and
with
inconsistency
express
his
high
gratification
in
Bishop
's
good
opinion

<EOS>
Bishop
then
---
jauntily
step
out
a
little
with
his
well

right
leg
,
as
though
he
say
to
Mr
Merdle
"
do
not
mind
the
apron
;
<EOS>
a
mere
form

"
put
this
case
to
his
good
friend
:
   
<EOS>
whether
it
have
occur
to
his
good
friend
,
that
Society
may
not
unreasonably
hope
that
one
so
blest
in
his
undertaking
,
and
whose
example
on
his
pedestal
be
so
influential
with
it
,
would
shed
a
little
money
in

direction
of
a
mission
or
so
to
Africa
?
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
signify
that
the
idea
should
have
his
good
attention
,
Bishop
put
another
case
:
   
<EOS>
whether
his

have
at
all
interested
himself
in

whether

have
occur

him
that
to

money
in
that
direction
may
be
a
great
conception
finely
execute
?
   
<EOS>
Mr
Merdle
make
a
similar
reply
,
and
Bishop
explain
his
reason
for
inquire
.
   
<EOS>
society
look
to
such
man
as
his
good
friend
to
do
such
thing
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
he
look
to
them
,
but
that
Society
look
to
them
.
   
<EOS>
just
as
it
be
not
Our
Committee
who
want
the
Additional
Endowed

,
but
it
be
Society
that
be
in
a
state
of
the
most
agonising
uneasiness
of
mind
until
it
get
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
beg
to
assure
his
good

that
he
be
extremely
sensible
of
his
good

regard
on
all
occasion
for
the

and
he
consider
that
he

<EOS>
Bishop
then
betook
himself
up

stair
,
and
the
other
magnate
gradually
float
up
after
him
until
there
be
no

Mr

<EOS>

go
slowly
up
after

become
of

on

<EOS>
Mrs

<EOS>
among

"
Bar
and
Bishop
have
both
be
bystander
during
this
short
dialogue
,
and
as
Mr
Merdle
be
sweep
away
by
the
crowd
,
they
make
their
remark
upon
it
to
the
physician
.
 
<EOS>
Bar
say
,
there
be
a
certain
point
of
mental
strain
beyond
which
no
man
could
go
;
that
the
point
vary
with
various
texture
of
brain
and
peculiarity
of
constitution
,
as
he
have
have
occasion
to
notice
in
several
of
his
learned
brother
;
but
the
point
of
endurance
pass
by
a
line
's
breadth
,
depression
and
dyspepsia
ensue
.
 
<EOS>
not
to
intrude
on
the
sacred
mystery
of
medicine
,
he
take
it
,
now
(
with
the
jury
droop
and
persuasive
eye
-
glass
)
,
that
this
be
Merdle
's
case
?
 
<EOS>
Bishop
say
that
when
he
be
a
young
man
,
and
have
fall
for
a
brief
space
into
the
habit
of
write
sermon
on
Saturdays
,
a
habit
which
all
young
son
of
the
church
should
sedulously
avoid
,
he
have
frequently
be
sensible
of
a
depression
,
arise
as
he
suppose
from
an
over
-
tax
intellect
,
upon
which
the
yolk
of
a
new
-
lay
egg
,
beat
up
by
the
good
woman
in
whose
house
he
at
that
time
lodge
,
with
a
glass
of
sound
sherry
,
nutmeg
,
and
powder
sugar
act
like
a
charm
.
 
<EOS>
without
presume
to
offer
so
simple
a
remedy
to
the
consideration
of
so
profound
a
professor
of
the
great
healing
art
,
he
would
venture
to
inquire
whether
the
strain
,
be
by
way
of
intricate
calculation
,
the
spirit
may
not
(
humanly
speak
)
be
restore
to
their
tone
by
a
gentle
and
yet
generous
stimulant
?
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
the
physician
,
"
yes
,
you
be
both
right
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
may
as
well
tell
you
that
I
can
find
nothing
the
matter
with
Mr
Merdle
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
constitution
of
a
rhinoceros
,
the
digestion
of
an
ostrich
,

the
concentration
of
an
oyster

<EOS>
as
to
nerve
,
Mr
Merdle
be
of
a
cool
temperament
,
and
not
a
sensitive
man
:
be
about
as
invulnerable
,
I
should
say
,
as
Achilles

<EOS>
how
such
a

should
suppose
himself
unwell
without

,
you
may
think
strange

<EOS>
but
I
have
find
nothing

with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
have
some
deep

seated
recondite
complaint
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not

<EOS>
I
only
say
,
that
at

I
have
not

"
   
<EOS>
there

complaint

there
be
no
shadow

Mr

complaint
on
young
Sparkler
hover
about
the
room
,
monomaniacally
seek
any
sufficiently
ineligible
young
lady
with
no
nonsense
about
her

there
be
no
shadow
of
Mr
Merdle
's
complaint
on
the
Barnacles
and
Stiltstalkings
,
of
whom
whole
colony
be
present

or
on
any

even
on

its

faint

<EOS>
Mr

complaint

<EOS>
Society
<EOS>
and
he
have
so
much
to
do
with

that
it

imagine
his

have
he
that

Patience

<EOS>
in

the

<EOS>
a
puzzle
 
Mr
Clennam
do
not
increase
in
favour
with
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
in
the
ratio
of
his
increase
visit
.
 
<EOS>
His
obtuseness
on
the
great
testimonial
question
be
not
calculate
to
awaken
admiration
in
the
paternal
breast
,
but
have
rather
a
tendency
to
give
offence
in
that
sensitive
quarter
,
and
to
be
regard
as
a
positive
shortcoming
in
point
of
gentlemanly
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
an
impression
of
disappointment
,
occasion
by
the
discovery
that
Mr
Clennam
scarcely
possess
that
delicacy
for
which
,
in
the
confidence
of
his
nature
,
he
have
be
incline
to
give
him
credit
,
begin
to
darken
the
fatherly
mind
in
connection
with
that
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
the
father
go
so
far
as
to
say
,
in
his
private
family
circle
,
that
he
fear
Mr
Clennam
be
not
a
man
of
high
instinct
.
<EOS>
He
be
happy
,
he
observe
,
in
his
public
capacity
as
leader
and
representative
of
the
College
,
to
receive
Mr
Clennam
when
he
call
to
pay
his
respect
;
but
he
do
not
find
that
he
get
on
with
him
personally
.
 
<EOS>
there
appear
to
be
something
(
he
do
not
know
what
it

want
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
Howbeit
,
the
father
do
not
fail
in
any
outward
show
of
politeness
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
honour
him
with
much
attention
;
perhaps
cherish
the
hope
that
,
although
not
a
man
of
a
sufficiently
brilliant
and
spontaneous
turn
of
mind
to
repeat
his
former
testimonial
unsolicited
,
it
may
still
be
within
the
compass
of
his
nature
to
bear
the
part
of
a
responsive
gentleman
,
in
any
correspondence
that
way
tend
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
threefold
capacity
,
of
the
gentleman
from

who
have
be
accidentally
lock
in
on
the
night
of
his
first
appearance

of
the
gentleman
from

have
inquire
into
the
affair
of
the
Father
of
the

with
the
stupendous
idea
of

out

Clennam
soon
become

He

woman
point
to
the
little
window

whence
her
son
may
be
see
sit
disconsolate
in
the
tuneless
grove
;
and
again
shake
her
head
and
wipe
her
eye
,

besought
him
,
for
the
united
sakes
of
both
the
young
people

to
exercise
his
influence
towards
the
bright
reversal

dismal
event

<EOS>
She
be
so
confident
in
her
exposition
of
the
case
,
and
it
be
so
undeniably
found
on
correct
premise
in
so
far
as
the
relative
position
of
little
Dorrit
and
her
family
be
concern
,
that
Clennam
could
not
feel
positive
on
the
other
side
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
come
to
attach
to
Little
Dorrit
an
interest
so
peculiar
---
an
interest
that
remove
her
from
,
while
it
grow
out
of
,
the
common
and
coarse
thing
surround
her
---
that
he
find
it
disappointing
,
disagreeable
,
almost
painful
,
to
suppose
her
in
love
with
young
Mr
Chivery
in
the
back
-
yard
,
or
any
such
person
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
he
reason
with
himself
that
she
be
just
as
good
and
just
as
true
in
love
with
him
,
as
not
in
love
with
him
;
and
that
to
make
a
kind
of
domesticate
fairy
of
her
,
on
the
penalty
of
isolation
at
heart
from
the
only
people
she
know
,
would
be
but
a
weakness
of
his
own
fancy
,
and
not
a
kind
one
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
her
youthful
and
ethereal
appearance
,
her
timid
manner
,
the
charm
of
her
sensitive
voice
and
eye
,
the
very
many
respect
in
which
she
have
interest
him
out
of
her
own
individuality
,
and
the
strong
difference
between
herself
and
those
about
her
,
be
not
in
unison
,
and
be
determine
not
to
be
in
unison
,
with
this
newly
present
idea
.
   
<EOS>
He
tell
the
worthy
Mrs
Chivery
,
after
turn
these
thing
over
in
his
mind
---
he
do
that
,
indeed
,
while
she
be
yet
speak
---
that
he
may
be
rely
upon
to
do
his
utmost
at
all
time
to
promote
the
happiness
of
Miss
Dorrit
,
and
to
further
the
wish
of
her
heart
if
it
be
in
his
power
to
do
so
,
and
if
he
could
discover
what
they
be
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
he
caution
her
against
assumption
and
appearance
;
enjoin
strict
silence
and
secrecy
,
lest
Miss
Dorrit
should
be
make
unhappy
;
and
particularly
advise
her
to
endeavour
to
win
her
son
's
confidence
and
so
to
make
quite
sure
of
the
state
of
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Chivery
consider
the
latter
precaution
superfluous
,
but
say
she
would
try
.
 
<EOS>
She
shake
her
head
as
if
she
have
not
derive
all
the
comfort
she
have
fondly
expect
from
this
interview
,
but
thank
him
nevertheless
for
the
trouble
he
have
kindly
take
.
 
<EOS>
They
then
part
good
friend
,
and
Arthur
walk
away
.
   
<EOS>
the
crowd
in
the
street
jostle
the
crowd
in
his
mind
,
and
the
two
crowd
make
a
confusion
,
he
avoid
London
Bridge
,
and
turn
off
in
the
quieter
direction
of
the
Iron
Bridge
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
scarcely
set
foot
upon
it
,
when
he
see
Little
Dorrit
walk
on
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
pleasant
day
,
with
a
light
breeze
blow
,
and
she
seem
to
have
that
minute
come
there
for
air
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
leave
her
in
her
father
's
room
within
an
hour
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
timely
chance
,
favourable
to
his
wish
of
observe
her
face
and
manner
when
no
one
else
be
by
.
 
<EOS>
He
quicken
his
pace
;
but
before
he
reach
her
,
she
turn
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
have
I
startle
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I

the
step
,
"
she
answer
,
hesitate
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
do
you
know
it
,
Little
Dorrit
?
 
<EOS>
You
could
hardly
have
expect
mine
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
expect
any
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
I
hear
a
step
,
I
think
it
---
sound
like
your
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
be
you
go
further
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
,
I
be
only
walk
her
for
a
little
change
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
walk
together
,
and
she
recover
her
confiding
manner
with
him
,
and
look
up
in
his
face
as
she
say
,
after
glance
around
:
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
so
strange
.
 
<EOS>

little

easily
to
be
detect
by

eye
in
Mr

they
almost
always
involve
some
ingenious
simplification

plain
road

It
occur
to
Arthur

such

the
whole
have
at

a
fanciful

the

not

I
have
an
interest

a
respect

once
more

eye

impressive

down

good
of

also

Mr

conclude
by
blow
off
that
steam
of
his

<EOS>
a
momentary
silence
that
ensue
be
break
by
Mr

Aunt

who
have
be
sit
upright
in
a
cataleptic
state
since
her
last
public
remark

<EOS>
She
now
undergo
a
violent
twitch
,
calculate
to
produce
a
startling
effect
on
the
nerve
of
the
uninitiated
,
and
with
the
deadly
animosity
observe
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
make
a
head
and
brain
out
of
a
brass
knob
with
nothing
in
it

<EOS>
You
could
not
do
it
when
your
Uncle
George
be
live
;
much
less
when
he
be
dead
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
be
not
slow
to
reply
,
with
his
usual
calmness
,
"
indeed
,
madam
!
 
<EOS>
bless
my
soul
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
to
hear
it

"
 
<EOS>
despite
his
presence
of
mind
,
however
,
the
speech
of
Mr
F
's
Aunt
produce
a
depressing
effect
on
the
little
assembly
;
firstly
,
because
it
be
impossible
to
disguise
that
Clennam
's
unoffending
head
be
the
particular
temple
of
reason
depreciate
;
and
secondly
,
because
nobody
ever
know
on
these
occasion
whose
Uncle
George
be
refer
to
,
or
what
spectral
presence
may
be
invoke
under
that
appellation
.
   
<EOS>
therefore
Flora
say
,
though
still
not
without
a
certain
boastfulness
and
triumph
in
her
legacy
,
that
Mr

Aunt
be
"
very
lively
to
-
day
,
and
she
think
they
have
better
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
Mr
F
's
Aunt
prove
so
lively
as
to
take
the
suggestion
in
unexpected
dudgeon
and
declare
that
she
would
not
go
;
add
,
with
several
injurious
expression
,
that
if
"
He
"
---
too
evidently
mean
Clennam

want
to
get
rid
of
her
,
"
let
him
chuck
her
out
of
winder
;

urgently
express
her
desire
to
see

Him
"
perform
that
ceremony

<EOS>
in
this
dilemma
,
Mr

whose
resource
appear
equal

any
emergency
in

patriarchal
water

slip
on
his
hat
,
slip
out
at
the
counting
-
house
door
,
and
slip
in
again
a
moment
afterwards
with
an
artificial
freshness
upon
him

as
if
he
have
be
in
the
country
for
some

Better

"
secondly
,
and
lastly
,
what
do
you
want
to
know
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
fish
up
his
note
-
book
before
the
question
be
put
,
and
button
it
with
care
in
an
inner
breast
-
pocket
,
and
look
straight
at
Clennam
all
the
time
,
reply
with
a
pause
and
a
puff
,
"
I
want
supplementary
information
of
any
sort
.
"
   
<EOS>
Clennam
could
not
withhold
a
smile

as

so
useful
to
that
unwieldy
ship
,
the
Casby

wait
on

watch
him
as
if
it
be
seek
an
opportunity
of
run
in
and
rifle
him
of
all
he
want
before
he
could
resist
its
manoeuvre
;
though
there
be
that
in
Mr
Pancks
's
eagerness
,
too
,
which
awaken
many
wonder
speculation
in
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
little
consideration
,
he
resolve
to
supply
Mr
Pancks
with
such
leading
information
as
it
be
in
his
power
to
impart
him
;
<EOS>
well
know
that
Mr

,
if
he
fail
in
his
present
research

be
pretty
sure
to
find
other
mean
of
get
it
.
   
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
first
request
Mr

to
remember
his
voluntary
declaration
that
his
proprietor
have
no
part
in
the
disclosure
,
and
that
his
own
intention
be
good
(
two
declaration
which
that
coaly
little
gentleman
with
the
great
ardour
repeat
)
,
openly
tell
him
that
as
to
the
Dorrit
lineage
or
former
place
of
habitation
,
he
have
no
information
to
communicate
,
and
that
his
knowledge
of
the
family
do
not
extend
beyond
the
fact
that
it
appear
to
be

reduce
to
five

to

<EOS>
the
age
of
the
whole
family
he
make
known
to
Mr
Pancks
,
as
nearly
as
he
could
guess
at
them
;
and
finally
he
describe
to
him
the
position
of
the
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
,
and
the
course
of
time
and
event
through
which

with
that
character

<EOS>
to
all
this

blow
in
a
more
and
more
portentous
manner
as
he
become
more
interested

listen
with
great
attention

appear
to
derive
the
most
agreeable
sensation
from
the
painfullest
part
of
the

particularly
to
be
quite

by
the
account
of

long
imprisonment

Mr

Arthur

"
I
have
but
to

have
reason

one

the
other

the
proposal
originate
with
himself
,
and
be
couch
in
the
pithy
term
,
"
if
your
John
be
weak
enough
,
madam
,
not
to
take
it
,
that
be
no
reason
why
you

not
you

so

quite
between

"
   
<EOS>
what
Mr

think
of
these
thing
,
or
how
much
or
how
little
he
know
about
them
,
be
never
gather
from
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
already
remark
that
he
be
a
man
of
few
word
;
and
it
may
be
here
observe
that
he
have
imbibe
a
professional
habit
of
lock
everything
up
.
 
<EOS>
He
lock
himself
up
as
carefully
as
he
lock
up
the
Marshalsea
debtor
.
 
<EOS>
even
his
custom
of
bolt
his
meal
may
have
be
a
part
of
an
uniform
whole
;
but
there
be
no
question
,
that
,
as
to
all
other
purpose
,
he
keep
his
mouth
as
he
keep
the
Marshalsea
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
open
it
without
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
when
it
be
necessary
to
let
anything
out
,
he
open
it
a
little
way
,
hold
it
open
just
as
long
as
suffice
for
the
purpose
,
and
lock
it
again
.
   
<EOS>
even
as
he
would
be
spare
of
his
trouble
at
the
Marshalsea
door
,
and
would
keep
a
visitor
who
want
to
go
out
,
wait
for
a
few
moment
if
he
see
another
visitor
come
down
the
yard
,
so
that
one
turn
of
the
key
should
suffice
for
both
,
similarly
he
would
often
reserve
a
remark
if
he
perceive
another
on
its
way
to
his
lip
,
and
would
deliver
himself
of
the
two
together
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
any
key
to
his
inner
knowledge
be
to
be
find
in
his
face
,
the
Marshalsea
key
be
as
legible
as
an
index
to
the
individual
character
and
history
upon
which
it
be
turn
.
   
<EOS>
that
Mr
Pancks
should
be
move
to
invite
any
one
to
dinner
at
Pentonville
,
be
an
unprecedented
fact
in
his
calendar
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
invite
Young
John
to
dinner
,
and
even
bring
him
within
range
of
the
dangerous
(
because
expensive
)
fascination
of
Miss
Rugg

<EOS>
the
banquet

a
Sunday

and
Miss
Rugg

her
own
hand

of
mutton
with
oyster

the
occasion

and
send
it

<EOS>
and

the
store
of

not
the
chief
part
of

<EOS>
Its
special
feature
be
a
foregone

Bawkins

I
suppose
I
could
have
put

think
it
worth

that
the

not

Young

"
I

It

truly
thankful

"
   
<EOS>
but
for
a
grave
waggishness
in
Mr
Rugg
's
manner
of
deliver
this
introduction
to
the
feast
,
it
may
have
appear
that
Miss

<EOS>
panck
recognise
the
sally
in
his
usual
way
,
and
take
in
his
provender
in
his
usual
way

<EOS>
Miss
Rugg
,
perhaps
make
up
some
of
her
arrear
,
likewise
take
very
kindly
to
the
mutton
,
and
it
rapidly
diminish
to
the
bone
.
 
<EOS>
a
bread
-
and

butter
pudding
entirely
disappear
,
and
a
considerable
amount
of
cheese
and
radish
vanish
by
the
same
mean

then
come
the
dessert

<EOS>
the
ensue

look
over
his
note

studiously

and
pick
out
little
extract

which
he
write
on
separate
slip
of
paper
on
the
table
;
Mr
Rugg
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
look
at
him
with
close
attention
,
and
Young
John
lose
his
uncollected
eye
in
mist
of
meditation
.
 
<EOS>
when
Mr
Pancks
,
who
support
the
character
of
chief
conspirator
,
have
complete
his
extract
,
he
look
them
over
,
correct
them
,
put
up
his
note
-
book
,
and
hold
them
like
a
hand
at
card
.
   
<EOS>
"
now

there

Young

when
he
have
thus
dispose
of
his
card

all
be
do
very
quietly
and
in
a
suppress
tone

Mr
Pancks
puff
his
way
into
his
own
breast

tug
out
a
canvas

I
can
only
assure
you

Young
John
,
"
that
I
deeply
regret
my
circumstance
be
such
that
I
can
not
afford

or
that
it
be
not
advisable
to
allow
me
the
time
necessary
for
my
do
the
distance
on

because
nothing
would
give
me
great
satisfaction
than

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
this
young
man
's
disinterestedness
appear
so
very
ludicrous
in
the
eye
of
Miss
Rugg
,
that
she
be
oblige
to
effect
a
precipitate
retirement
from
the
company
,
and
to
sit
upon
the
stair
until
she
have
have
her
laugh
out
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
Mr
Pancks
,
look
,
not
without
some
pity
,
at
Young
John
,
slowly
and
thoughtfully
twist
up
his
canvas
bag
as
if
he
be
wring
its
neck

the
lady

return
as
he
restore
it
to
his
pocket

mixed
rum

the
party

her
fair
self

every
one
his
glass

<EOS>
when
all
be
supply

Mr
Rugg
rise
,
and
silently
hold
out
his
glass
at
arm
's
length
above
the
centre
of
the
table
,
by
that
gesture
<EOS>
invite
the
other
three
to
add
theirs
,
and
to
unite
in
a
general
conspiratorial
clink
.
 
<EOS>
the
ceremony
be
effective
up
to
a
certain
point
,
and
would
have
be
wholly
so
throughout
,
if
Miss
Rugg
,
as
she
raise
her
glass
to
her
lip
in
completion
of
it
,
have
not
happen
to
look
at
Young
John
;
when
she
be
again
<EOS>
so
overcome
by
the
contemptible
comicality
of
his
disinterestedness
as
to
splutter
some
ambrosial
drop
of
rum
and
water
around
,
and
withdraw
in
confusion
.
   
<EOS>
such
be
the
dinner
without
precedent
,
give
by
panck
at
Pentonville
;
and
such
be
the
busy
and
strange
life
Pancks
lead
.
<EOS>
the
only
wake
moment
at
which
he
appear
to
relax
from
his
care
,
and
to
recreate
himself
by
go
anywhere
or
say
anything
without
a
pervading
object
,
be
when
he
show
a
dawn
interest
in
the
lame
foreigner
with
the
stick
,
down
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
.
   
<EOS>
the
foreigner
,
by
name
John
Baptist
Cavalletto
---
they
call
him
Mr
Baptist
in
the
yard
---
be
such
a
chirp
,
easy
,
hopeful
little
fellow
,
that
his
attraction
for
panck
be
probably
in
the
force
of
contrast
.
 
<EOS>
Solitary
,
weak
,
and
scantily
acquaint
with
the
most
necessary
word
of
the
only
language
in
which
he
could
communicate
with
the
people
about
him
<EOS>
,
he
go
with
the
stream
of
his
fortune
,
in
a
brisk
way
that
be
new
in
those
part

<EOS>
with
little
to
eat
,
and
less
to
drink

nothing

what
he
wear
upon
him
,
or
have
bring
tie
up
in
one
of
the
small
bundle
that
ever
be
see

he
put
as
bright
a
face
upon
it

he
be
in
the
most
flourishing
circumstance
when
he
first
hobble
up
and
down
the
Yard
,
humbly
propitiate
the
general
good
-
will
with
his
white
tooth
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
uphill
work
for
a
foreigner
,
lame
or
sound
,
to
make
his
way
with
the
Bleeding
Hearts
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
they
be
vaguely
persuade
that
every
foreigner
have
a
knife
about
him
;
in
the
second
,
they
hold
it
to
be
a
sound
constitutional
national
axiom
that
he
ought
to
go
home
to
his
own
country
.
 
<EOS>
They
never
think
of
inquire
how
many
of
their
own
countryman
would
be
return
upon
their
hand
from
diver
part
of
the
world
,
if
the
principle
be
generally
recognise
;
they
consider
it
particularly
and
peculiarly
british
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
third
place
,
they
have
a
notion
that
it
be
a
sort
of
divine
visitation
upon
a
foreigner
that
he
be
not
an
Englishman
,
and
that
all
kind
of
calamity
happen
to
his
country
because
it
do
thing
that
England
do
not
,
and
do
not
do
thing
that
England
do
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
belief
,
to
be
sure
,
they
have
long
be
carefully
train
by
the
Barnacles
and
Stiltstalkings
,
who
be
always
proclaim
to
them
,
officially
,
that
no
country
which
fail
to
submit
itself
to
those
two
large
family
could
possibly
hope
to
be
under
the
protection
of
Providence
;
and
who
,
when
they
believe
it
,
disparage
them
in
private
as
the
most
prejudiced
people
under
the
sun
.
   
<EOS>
this
,
therefore
,
may
be
call
a
political
position
of
the
Bleeding
Hearts
;
but
they
entertain
other
objection
to
have
foreigner
in
the
Yard
.
 
<EOS>
They
believe
that
foreigner
be
always
badly
off
;
and
though
they
be
as
ill
off
themselves
as
they
could
desire
to
be
,
that
do
not
diminish
the
force
of
the
objection
.
<EOS>
They
believe
that
foreigner
be
dragoon
and
bayonet
;
and
though
they
certainly
get
their
own
skull
promptly
fracture
if
they
show
any
ill
-
humour
,
still
it
be
with
a
blunt
instrument
,
and
that
do
not
count
.
 
<EOS>
They
believe
that
foreigner
be
always
immoral
;
and
though
they
have
an
occasional
assize
at
home
,
and
now
and
then
a
divorce
case
or
so
,
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
They
believe
that
foreigner
have
no
independent
spirit
,
as
never
be
escort
to
the
poll
in
drove
by
Lord
Decimus
Tite
Barnacle
,
with
colour
fly
and
the
tune
of
Rule
Britannia
playing
.
 
<EOS>
not
to
be
tedious
,
they
have
many
other
belief
of
a
similar
kind
.
   
<EOS>
against
these
obstacle
,
the
lame
foreigner
with
the
stick
have
to
make
head
as
well
as
he
could
;
not
absolutely
single
-
handed
,
because
Mr
Arthur
Clennam
have
recommend
him
to
the
Plornishes
(
he
live
at
the
top
of
the
same
house
)
,
but
still
at
heavy
odd
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
Bleeding
Hearts
be
kind
heart
;
and
when
they
see
the
little
fellow
cheerily
limp
about
with
a
good
-
humoured
face
,
do
no
harm
,
draw
no
knife
,
commit
no
outrageous
immorality
,
live
chiefly
on
farinaceous
and
milk
diet
,
and
play
with
Mrs
Plornish
's
child
of
an
evening
,
they
begin
to
think
that
although
he
could
never
hope
to
be
an
Englishman
,
still
it
would
be
hard
to
visit
that
affliction
on
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
They
begin
to
accommodate
themselves
to
his
level
,
call
him
"
Mr
Baptist
,
"
but
treat
him
like
a
baby
,
and
laugh
immoderately
at
his
lively
gesture
and
his
childish
English
---
more
,
because
he
do
not
mind
it
,
and
laugh
too
.
 
<EOS>
They
speak
to
him
in
very
loud
voice
as
if
he
be
stone
deaf
.
 
<EOS>
They
construct
sentence
,
by
way
of
teach
him
the
language
in
its
purity
,
such
as
be
address
by
the
savage
to
Captain
Cook
,
or
by
Friday
to
Robinson
Crusoe
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Plornish
be
particularly
ingenious
in
this
art
;
and
attain
so
much
celebrity
for
say
"
Me
ope
you
leg
well
soon
,
"
that
it
be
consider
in
the
Yard
but
a
very
short
remove
indeed
from
speak
Italian
.
 
<EOS>
even
Mrs
Plornish
herself
begin
to
think
that
she
have
a
natural
call
towards
that
language
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
become
more
popular
,
household
object
be
bring
into
requisition
for
his
instruction
in
a
copious

and
whenever
he
appear
in
the

out
at

at

exhibit
those

and
penetrate
him
with
a
sense
of
the
appalling
difficulty
of
the
anglo

Saxon
tongue
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
in
this
stage
of
his
progress
,
and
in
about
the

of
his

that
Mr

State
of
Mind
 
<EOS>
if
Arthur
Clennam
have
not
arrive
at
that
wise
decision
firmly
to
restrain
himself
from
love
Pet
,
he
would
have
live
on
in
a
state
of
much
perplexity
,
involve
difficult
struggle
with
his
own
heart
.
 
<EOS>
not
the
least
of
these
would
have
be
a
contention
,
always
wage
within
it
,
between
a
tendency
to
dislike
Mr
Henry
Gowan
,
if
not
to
regard
him
with
positive
repugnance
,
and
a
whisper
that
the
inclination
be
unworthy
.
 
<EOS>
a
generous
nature
be
not
prone
to
strong
aversion
,
and
be
slow
to
admit
them
even
dispassionately
;
but
when
it
find
ill
-
will
gain
upon
it
,
and
can
discern
between
-
while
that
its
origin
be
not
dispassionate
,
such
a
nature
become
distressed
.
   
<EOS>
Therefore
Mr
Henry
Gowan
would
have
cloud
Clennam
's
mind
,
and
would
have
be
far
oftener
present
to
it
than
more
agreeable
person
and
subject
but
for
the
great
prudence
of
his
decision
aforesaid
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
Mr
Gowan
seem
transfer
to
Daniel
Doyce
's
mind
;
at
all
event

it
so
happen
that
it
usually
fall
to
Mr

rather

to

they
hold
together

these
be
of

He

there
have
be
something
serious
at

they
separate

<EOS>
by

they
have
visit

always
observe

to
Mr

back
the
cloud
which
have
obscure
Mr
Meagles
's
sunshine
on
the
morning
of
the
chance
encounter
at
the
Ferry
.
 
<EOS>
if
Clennam
have
ever
admit
the
forbidden
passion
into
his
breast

this
period
may
have
be
a
period
of
real
trial

under
the
actual
circumstance

doubtless
it
be
nothing
---
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
equally
,
if
his
heart
have
give
entertainment
to
that
prohibit
guest
,
his
silent
fighting
of
his
way
through
the
mental
condition
of
this
period
may
have
be
a
little
meritorious
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
constant
effort
not
to
be
betray
into
a
new
phase
of
the
besetting
sin
of
his
experience
,
the
pursuit
of
selfish
object
by
low
and
small
mean
,
and
to
hold
instead
to
some
high
principle
of
honour
and
generosity
,
there
may
have
be
a
little
merit
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
resolution
not

to
avoid
Mr

the
selfish
sparing
of
himself

he
should
bring
any
slight
distress
upon
the
daughter
through
make
her
the
cause
of
an
estrangement
which
he
believe
the
father
would
regret

there
may
have
be
a
little
merit

<EOS>
in
the
modest
truthfulness
of
always
keep
in

the
great
equality
of
Mr
Gowan
's
year

the
great
attraction
of
his
person

manner

there
may
have
be
a
little
merit

in
do
all
this

much
more
,
in
a
perfectly
unaffected
way

with
a
manful
and

constancy

the

within

preserve

of
itself

in

supposititious

Mrs

expect

to

<EOS>
He
perfectly
know
that

never
have
get
him
in

but
he
grimly
gratify
himself
with
the
idea
that
the
public
keep
him
out

<EOS>
under
the
influence
of
this
injury
(
and
perhaps
of
some
little
straitness
and
irregularity
in
the
matter
of
wage
)
,
he
have
grow
neglectful
of
his
person
and
morose
in
mind
;
and
now
behold
in
Clennam
one
of
the
degrade
body
of
his
oppressor

receive
him

ignominy

<EOS>
Mrs

however

receive
him
with
condescension

<EOS>
He
find
her

old

formerly
a
Beauty

still
sufficiently
well

favour
to
have
dispense
with
the

on
her
nose
and
a
certain
impossible
bloom
under

eye

<EOS>
She
be
a

lofty

him

so
be
another

dark

who
must
have
have
something
real

could
not

but
it
be
certainly
not
her

or

so
be
a
grey
old
gentleman
of
dignified

sullen
appearance
;
both
of

<EOS>
but
,
as
they

foreigner

He

be
so
obliging

<EOS>
there
be
a
whisper

the
pervading
bohemian
character
in
the
nomadic
nature
of
the

its
curious

of
plate

the

infinitely

there

a
microscopically
small
footboy

who
wait
on
the
malevolent
man
who
have
not

<EOS>
even
this
youth
,
if
his

would
have

Mrs

It

all
would

I

"
<EOS>
the
old
lady
with
the

assent
;

add
that
if
Augustus
Stiltstalking
have
in
a
general
way
order
the
cavalry
out
with
instruction
to
charge
,
she
think
the

<EOS>
the

assent
;

add
that
if
William
Barnacle

Tudor
Stiltstalking
,
when
they
come
over
to
one
another

form
their
ever

memorable

have
boldly
muzzle

person

at

he
think

<EOS>
It
be
agree
that
the
country
(
another
word
for
the
Barnacles
and
Stiltstalkings
)
want
preserving
,
but
how
it
come
to
want
preserving
be
not
so
clear

<EOS>
It

only
clear
that
the

be
all
about
John

Augustus
Stiltstalking
,
William
Barnacle
and
Tudor
Stiltstalking
,
Tom

Dick

or
Harry
Barnacle

Stiltstalking
,
because
there
be
nobody
else
but
mob

<EOS>
and
this
be
the
feature
of
the
conversation
which
impress
Clennam
,
as
a
man
not
used
to
it
,
very
disagreeably
:
make
him
doubt
if
it
be
quite
right
to
sit
there
,
silently
hear
a
great
nation
narrow
to
such
little
bound
.
 
<EOS>
remembering
,
however
,
that
in
the
parliamentary
debate
,
whether
on
the
life
of
that
nation
's
body
or
the
life
of
its
soul
,
the
question
be
usually
all
about

between
John
Barnacle

Augustus
Stiltstalking
,
William
Barnacle
and
Tudor
Stiltstalking
,
Tom
,
Dick
,
or
Harry
Barnacle

and
nobody
else

he
say
nothing
on
the
part
of
mob
,
bethink
himself
that
mob
be
use
to
it

<EOS>
Mr
Henry
Gowan
seem
to
have
a
malicious
pleasure
in
play
off
the
three
talker
against
each
other
,
and
in
see
Clennam
startle
by
what
they
say
.
 
<EOS>
have
as
supreme
a
contempt
for
the
class
that
have
throw
him
off
as
for
the
class
that
have
not
take
him
on
,
he
have
no
personal
disquiet
in
anything
that
pass
.
 
<EOS>
His
healthy
state
of
mind
appear
even
to
derive
a
gratification
from
Clennam
's
position
of
embarrassment
and
isolation
among
the
good
company
;
and
if
Clennam
have
be
in
that
condition
with
which
nobody
be
incessantly
contend
,
he
would
have
suspect
it
,
and
would
have
struggle
with
the
suspicion
as
a
meanness
,
even
while
he
sit
at
the

<EOS>
in

solemn

shrewd

Mr

evidently

I
believe
Miggles
belong
to

It
ought
to
have

Mr

can
you

credulous

<EOS>
It
make
such
a
painful
impression
upon
him
to
hear
her
talk
in

haughty
tone

to
see
her
pat
her
contemptuous

very
earnestly

She

again
sit

toss
her

she
add
,

at

up

Mr

come
across

,
"
Mother

if
you

we

<EOS>
Mr

thereupon
rise
,
as
he
have
no
choice

to
do
;
and
Mrs

show
him
,
to
the
last
,
the
same
look
and
the
same
tap
contemptuous
lip
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
have
a
portentously
long
audience
of
my

"
say
Gowan
,
as
the
door
close
upon
them

<EOS>
"
I
fervently
hope
she
have
not

you

<EOS>
"
not

Clennam

<EOS>
They
have
a
little
open
phaeton
for
the
journey

be
soon
in
it
on
the
road
home

<EOS>
Gowan
,
driving
,
light
a
cigar
;
Clennam
decline
one

<EOS>
do
what
he
would
,
he
fall
into
such
a
mood
of
abstraction
that
Gowan
say
again
,
"
I
be
very
much
afraid
my

have
bore
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
to
which
he
rouse
himself
to
answer
,
"
not
at

and
soon
relapse
again
.
   
<EOS>
in
that
state
of
mind
which
render
nobody
uneasy
,
his
thoughtfulness
would
have
turn
principally
on
the
man
at
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
think
of
the
morning
when
he
first
see
him
root
out
the
stone
with
his
heel
,
and
would
have
ask
himself
,
"
do
he
jerk
me
out
of
the
path
in
the
same
careless
,
cruel
way
?
<EOS>
"
He
would
have
think
,
have
this
introduction
to
his
mother
be
bring
about
by
him
because
he
know
what
she
would
say
,
and
that
he
could
thus
place
his
position
before
a
rival
and
loftily
warn
him
off
,
without
himself
repose
a
word
of
confidence
in
him
?
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
think
,
even
if
there
be
no
such
design
as
that
,
have
he
bring
him
there
to
play
with
his
repressed
emotion
,
and
torment
him
?
 
<EOS>
the
current
of
these
meditation
would
have
be
stay
sometimes
by
a
rush
of
shame
,
bear
a
remonstrance
to
himself
from
his
own
open
nature
,
represent
that
to
shelter
such
suspicion
,
even
for
the
passing
moment
,
be
not
to
hold
the
high
,
unenvious
course
he
have
resolve
to
keep
.
 
<EOS>
at
those
time
,
the
striving
within
him
would
have
be
hard
;
and
look
up
and
catch
Gowan
's
eye
,
he
would
have
start
as
if
he
have
do
him
an
injury
.
   
<EOS>
then
,
look
at
the
dark
road
and
its
uncertain
object
,
he
would
have
gradually
trail
off
again
into
thinking
,
"
where
be
we
drive
,
he
and
I
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
,
on
the
dark
road
of
life
?
 
<EOS>
how
will
it
be
with
us
,
and
with
her
,
in
the
obscure
distance
?
"
 
<EOS>
think
of
her
<EOS>
,
he
would
have
be
trouble
anew
with
a
reproachful
misgiving
that
it
be
not
even
loyal
to
her
to
dislike
him
,
and
that
in
be
so
easily
prejudice
against
him
he
be
less
deserving
of
her
than
at
first

<EOS>
"
You
be
evidently
out
of

"
say
Gowan
;
"
I
be
very
much
afraid

you
dreadfully

I

we

rage

before
ever
such

nothing

after

awkwardly
enough

for

<EOS>
perhaps
because
her
appearance
be
not

perhaps
because
it
occur
to
him
that
his

her

may
expose
his

take
his

He
still
hope
to
resume
that
domestic

when
Fortune

smile
upon

<EOS>
Mrs

as
proud
of
her

's
talent
as
she

<EOS>
She
have
as
firm
a
belief
in
the
sweetness

<EOS>
the
poor

and
Strephon

wound
by
the

;
and
for
Mrs
Plornish
there
be
no
such
music
at
the
Opera
as
the
small
internal
fluttering
and
chirping
wherein
he
would
discharge
himself
of
these
ditty
,
like
a
weak
,
little
,
broken
barrel

organ
,
grind
by

<EOS>
on
his

day
out

"
those

"
it
be
at
once
Mrs

's
delight
and
sorrow
,
when
he
be
strong
with
meat

have
take
his

halfpenny

worth
of
porter
,
to
say
,
"
sing
us
a
song

Father

"
 
<EOS>
then
he
would
give
them
Chloe
,
and
if
he
be
in
pretty
good
spirit
,
Phyllis
also
---
Strephon
he
have
hardly
be
up
to
since
he
go
into
retirement

and
then
would
Mrs
Plornish
declare
she
do
believe
there
never
be
such
a
singer
as
Father
,
and
wipe
her
eye
.
   
<EOS>
if
he
have
come
from

nay
,
if
he

the
noble
Refrigerator
come
home
triumphantly
from
a
foreign
court
to
be
present

promote
on
his

tremendous
failure

Mrs

she

<EOS>
Father

you

<EOS>
as
to
Mr
Plornish
,
he
have
marry
these
article
of
belief
in

Mr

and
only
wonder
how
it
be
that
so
gift
an
old
gentleman
have
not
make
a
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
this
he
attribute
,
after
much
reflection
,
to
his
musical
genius
not
have
be
scientifically
develop
in
his
youth
.
 
<EOS>
"
for
why
,
"
argue
Mr
Plornish
,
"
why
go
a
-
bind
music
when
you
have
get
it
in
yourself
?
<EOS>
that
be
where
it
be
,
I
consider
.
"
   
<EOS>
Old
Nandy
have
a
patron
:
one
patron
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
patron
who
in
a
certain
sumptuous
way
---
an
apologetic
way
,
as
if
he
constantly
take
an
admire
audience
to
witness
that
he
really
could
not
help
be
more
free
with
this
old
fellow
than
they
may
have
expect
,
on
account
of
his
simplicity
and
poverty
---
be
mightily
good
to
him
.
<EOS>
Old
Nandy
have
be
several
time
to
the
Marshalsea
College
,
communicate
with
his
son
-
in

law
during
his
short
durance
there
;
and
have
happily
acquire
to
himself
,
and
have
by
degree
and
in
course
of
time
much
improve
,
the
patronage
of
the
Father
of
that
national
institution
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
be
in
the
habit
of
receive
this
old
man
as
if
the
old
man
hold
of
him
in
vassalage
under
some
feudal
tenure
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
little
treat
and
tea
for
him
,
as
if
he
come
in
with
his
homage
from
some
outlying
district
where
the
tenantry
be
in
a
primitive
state
.
   
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
there
be
moment
when
he
could
by
no
mean
have
swear
but
that
the
old
man
be
an
ancient
retainer
of
his

who
have
be
meritoriously
faithful

<EOS>
when
he
mention
him

he
speak
of
him
casually

He
have
a
wonderful
satisfaction
in
see
him
,
and
in
comment
on
his
decayed
condition
after
he
be

It
appear
to
him
amazing
that

so

opportunely
come
up
within

two

It

no

"
Amy

my

if

I
can
leave

<EOS>
Clennam

"

My

some

linger
in

It

Occasionally

up

He
hear
the

Mrs

complaint
 
resign
herself

inevitable
fate
by
make
the
good
of
those
people
,
the
Miggleses

submit
her
philosophy
to
the
draught
upon

of
which
she
have
foresee
the
likelihood
in
her
interview
with
Arthur
,
Mrs
Gowan
handsomely
resolve
not
to
oppose
her
son
's
marriage

<EOS>
in
her
progress
to
,
and
happy
arrival
at
,
this
resolution
,
she
be
possibly
influence
,
not
only
by
her
maternal
affection
but
by
three
politic
consideration
.
   
<EOS>
of
these
,
the
first
may
have
be
that
her
son
have
never
signify
the
small
intention
to
ask
her
consent
,
or
any
mistrust
of
his
ability
to
dispense
with
it
;
the
second
,
that
the
pension
bestow
upon
her
by
a
grateful
country
(
and
a
Barnacle
)
would
be
free
from
any
little
filial
inroad
,
when
her
Henry
should
be
marry
to
the
darle
<EOS>
only
child
of
a
man
in
very
easy
circumstance
;
the
third
,
that
Henry
's
debt
must
clearly
be
pay
down
upon
the
altar
-
railing
by
his
father
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
when
,
to
these
three
-
fold
point
of
prudence
there
be
add
the
fact
that
Mrs
Gowan
yield
her
consent
the
moment
she
know
of
Mr
Meagles
have
yield
his
,
and
that
Mr
Meagles
's
objection
to
the
marriage
have
be
the
sole
obstacle
in
its
way
all
along
,
it
become
the
height
of
probability
that
the
relict
of
the
deceased
Commissioner
of
nothing
particular
,
turn
these
idea
in
her
sagacious
mind
.
   
<EOS>
among
her
connection
and
acquaintance
,
however
,
she
maintain
her
individual
dignity
and
the
dignity
of
the
blood
of
the
Barnacles
,
by
diligently
nurse
the
pretence
that
it
be
a
most
unfortunate
business
;
that
she
be
sadly
cut
up
by
it
;
that
this
be
a
perfect
fascination
under
which
Henry
labour
;
that
she
have
oppose
it
for
a
long
time
,
but
what
could
a
mother
do
;
and
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
already
call
Arthur
Clennam
to
bear
witness
to
this
fable
,
as
a
friend
of
the
Meagles
family
;
and
she
follow
up
the
move
by
now
impound
the
family
itself
for
the
same
purpose
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
interview
she
accord
to
Mr
Meagles
,
she
slide
herself
into
the
position
of
disconsolately
but
gracefully
yield
to
irresistible
pressure
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
utmost
politeness
and
good
-
breeding
,
she
feign
that
it

she
---
not
he

who
have
make
the
difficulty
,
and
who
at
length
give
way

the
sacrifice
be
hers

the
same
feint

with
the
same
polite

she
foist
on
Mrs

,
as
a
conjuror
may
have
force

innocent
lady

and
,
when

future
daughter

son

in

<EOS>
in
answer
to
this
direct
appeal

Mrs

It

reach
this
point

more

more
respected

the
term

<EOS>
for
a
gentleman
who
have
this
splendid
work
cut
out
for
him
,
Mr

look
a
little
common
,

rather
as
if
,
in
the
course
of
his
vast
transaction
,
he
have
accidentally
make
an
interchange
of
head
with
some
inferior
spirit

He
present
himself
before
the
two

a
dismal
stroll

escape

<EOS>
in

he
fall
directly
into

Mr

be

the

be
fix

<EOS>
there
be
to
be
a
convocation
of
barnacle
on
the
occasion

in
order
that
that
very
high

very
large
family
may
shed
as
much
lustre
on
the

as
so
dim
an
event
be
capable
of
receive
.
   
<EOS>
to
have
get
the
whole
Barnacle
family
together
would
have
be
impossible
for
two
reason
.
 
<EOS>
firstly
,
because
no
building
could
have
hold
all
the
member
and
connection
of
that
illustrious
house
.
 
<EOS>
secondly
,
because
wherever
there
be
a
square
yard
of
ground
in
british
occupation
under
the
sun
or
moon
,
with
a
public
post
upon
it
,
stick
to
that
post
be
a
Barnacle

<EOS>
no
intrepid
navigator
could
plant
a
flag
-
staff
upon
any
spot
of
earth
,
and
take
possession
of
it
in
the
british
name
,
but
to
that
spot
of

,
so
soon
as
the
discovery
be
know
,
the
Circumlocution
Office
send
out
a
Barnacle

a
despatch

box

thus
the

be
all
over
the
world
,
in
every
direction
---
despatch
-
box
the
compass
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
while
the
so

potent
art
of
Prospero
himself
would
have
fail
in
summon
the
Barnacles
from
every
speck
of
ocean
and
dry
land
on
which
there
be
nothing
(
except
mischief
)
to
be

anything

it

<EOS>
It
would
have
be
so
cruel
if

have
mean

that
Clennam
firmly
resolve
to
believe
he
do
not

<EOS>
Gowan

without
pause

lay
his
hand
upon

laughingly

lightly
go

Clennam
,
I
do
not

dispel
your

I
would

live
in

what

I

what
all

if

we

now

whatever
he
have
hear

whether
it
deserve

another

it
sink
into
Clennam
's
mind

<EOS>
It
so
take
root
there
,
that
he
begin
to
fear
Henry
Gowan
would
always
be
a
trouble
to
him
,
and
that
so
far
he
have
gain
little
or
nothing
from
the
dismissal
of
Nobody

with
all
his
inconsistency
,
anxiety
,
and
contradiction

<EOS>
He
find
a
contest
still
always
go
on
in
his
breast
between
his
promise
to
keep
Gowan
in
none
but
good
aspect
before
the
mind
of
Mr
Meagles
,
and
his
enforced
observation
of
Gowan
in
aspect
that
have
no
good
in
them
.
 
<EOS>
nor
could
he
quite
support
his
own
conscientious
nature
against
misgiving
that
he
distort
and
discolour
himself
,
by
remind
himself
that
he
never
seek
those
discovery
,
and
that
he
would
have
avoid
them
with
willingness
and
great
relief
.
 
<EOS>
for
he
never
could
forget
what
he
have
be
;
and
he
know
that
he
have
once
dislike
Gowan
for
no
well
reason

that
he
have
come
in
his
way
.
   
<EOS>
harass
by
these
thought
,
he
now
begin
to
wish
the
marriage
over
,
Gowan
and
his
young
wife
go
,
and
himself
leave
to
fulfil
his
promise

discharge
the
generous
function
he
have
accept
.
 
<EOS>
this
last
week
be
,
in
truth
,
an
uneasy
interval
for
the
whole
house

<EOS>
before
Pet
,
or
before
Gowan
,
Mr
Meagles
be
radiant
;
but
Clennam
have
more
than
once
find
him
alone
,
with
his
view
of
the
scale
and
scoop
much
blur
,
and
have
often
see
him
look
after
the
lover
,
in
the
garden
or
elsewhere
when
he
be
not
see
by
them
,
with
the
old
clouded
face
on
which
Gowan
have
fall
like
a
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
arrangement
of
the
house
for
the
great
occasion
,
many
little
reminder
of
the
old
travel
of
the
father
and
mother
and
daughter
have
to
be
disturb
and
pass
from
hand
to
hand
;
and
sometimes
,
in
the
midst
of
these
mute
witness
,
to
the
life
they
have
have
together
,
even
Pet
herself
would
yield
to
lamenting

weeping

Mrs

the
blithe

about

everybody

but
she

honest
soul
,
have
her
flight
into
store
room
,
where
she
would
cry
until
her
eye
be
red
,
and
would
then
come
out
,
attribute
that
appearance
to
pickle
onion

clear

that
she
solicit
a

<EOS>
there

agreeably
help
the

along

and
treat
it

in
his
sparkling
way
,
as
one
of
the
official
form

fee
of
the
Church
Department
of
how

<EOS>
there
be
three
other
Young
Barnacles
from
three
other

insipid
to
all
the

there

great
game

<EOS>
there
be
Lord
Decimus
Tite
Barnacle
himself
,
in
the
odour
of
circumlocution

with
the
very
smell
of
Despatch

<EOS>
yes

there
be
Lord
Decimus
Tite
Barnacle
,
who
have
rise
to
official
height
on
the
wing
of
one
indignant
idea

and
that

My

a
Minister

<EOS>
that

in

that
this

it
behove
the
Pilot

<EOS>
on
this
sublime
discovery
in
the
great
art
how
not

do
it

Lord
Decimus
have
long
sustain
the
high
glory
of
the
Barnacle
family
;
and
let
any
ill
-
advise
member
of
either
House
but
try
how
to
do
it
by
bring
in
a
Bill
to
do
it
,
that
Bill
be
as
good
as
dead
and
bury
when
Lord
Decimus
Tite
Barnacle
rise
up
in
his
place
and
solemnly
say
,
soar
into
indignant
majesty
as
the
Circumlocution
cheering
soar
around
him
,
that
he
be
yet
to
be
tell
,
My
Lords
,
that
it
behove
him
as
the
Minister
of
this
free
country
,
to
set

,
to

,
to

the
independent

<EOS>
the
discovery
of
this
Behoving
Machine
be
the
discovery
of
the
political
perpetual
motion
.
 
<EOS>
It
never
wear
out
,
though
it
be
always
go
round
and
round
in
all
the
State
Departments
.
   
<EOS>
and
there
,
with
his
noble
friend
and
relative
Lord
Decimus
,
be
William
Barnacle
,
who
have
make
the
ever
-
famous
coalition
with
Tudor
Stiltstalking
,
and
who
always
keep
ready
his
own
particular
recipe
for
how
not
to
do
it
;
sometimes
tap
the
Speaker
,
and
draw
it
fresh
out
of
him
,
with
a
"
First
,
I
will
beg
you
,
sir
,
to
inform
the
House
what
Precedent
we
have
for
the
course
into
which
the
honourable
gentleman
would
precipitate
us
;
"
sometimes
ask
the
honourable
gentleman
to
favour
him
with
his
own
version
of
the
Precedent
;
sometimes
tell
the
honourable
gentleman
that
he
(
William
Barnacle
)
would
search
for
a
Precedent
;
and
oftentime
crush
the
honourable
gentleman
flat
on
the
spot
by
tell
him
there
be
no
Precedent
.
 
<EOS>
but
Precedent
and
Precipitate
be
,
under
all
circumstance
,
the
well
-
match
pair
of
battle
-
horse
of
this
able
Circumlocutionist
.
 
<EOS>
no
matter
that
the
unhappy
honourable
gentleman
have
be
try
in
vain
,
for
twenty
-
five
year
,
to
precipitate
William
Barnacle
into
this
---
William
Barnacle
still
put
it
to
the
House
,
and
(
at
second
-
hand
or
so
)
to
the
country
,
whether
he
be
to
be
precipitate
into
this
.
 
<EOS>
no
matter
that
it
be
utterly
irreconcilable
with
the
nature
of
thing
and
course
of
event
that
the
wretched
honourable
gentleman
could
possibly
produce
a
Precedent
for
this
---
William
Barnacle
would
nevertheless
thank
the
honourable
gentleman
for
that
ironical
cheer
,
and
would
close
with
him
upon
that
issue
,
and
would
tell
him
to
his
tooth
that
there
be
no
precedent
for
this
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
perhaps
have
be
object
that
the
William
Barnacle
wisdom
be
not
high
wisdom
or
the
earth
it
bamboozle
would
never
have
be
make
,
or
,
if
make
in
a
rash
mistake
,
would
have
remain
blank
mud
.
 
<EOS>
but
Precedent
and
Precipitate
together
frighten
all
objection
out
of
most
people
.
   
<EOS>
and
there
,
too
,
be
another
Barnacle
,
a
lively
one
,
who
have
leap
through
twenty
place
in
quick
succession
,
and
be
always
in
two
or
three
at
once
,
and
who
be
the
much
-
respected
inventor
of
an
art
which
he
practise
with
great
success
and
admiration
in
all
Barnacle
government
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
,
when
he
be
ask
a
Parliamentary
question
on
any
one
topic
,
to
return
an
answer
on
any
other
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
do
immense
service
,
and
bring
him
into
high
esteem
with
the
Circumlocution
Office
.
   
<EOS>
and
there
,
too
,
be
a
sprinkling
of
less
distinguished
Parliamentary
Barnacles
,
who
have
not
as
yet
get
anything
snug
,
and
be
go
through
their
probation
to
prove
their
worthiness
.
<EOS>
these
barnacle
perch
upon
staircase
and
hide
in
passage
,
wait
their
order
to
make
house
or
not
to
make
house
;
and
they
do
all
their
hearing
,
and
ohe
,
and
cheering
,
and
barking
,
under
direction
from
the
head
of
the
family
;
and
they
put
dummy
motion
on
the
paper
in
the
way
of
other
man
's
motion
;
and
they
stall
disagreeable
subject
off
until
late
in
the
night
and
late
in
the
session
,
and
then
with
virtuous
patriotism
cry
out
that
it
be
too
late
;
and
they
go
down
into
the
country
,
whenever
they
be
send
,
and
swear
that
Lord
Decimus
have
revive
trade
from
a
swoon
,
and
commerce
from
a
fit
,
and
have
double
the
harvest
of
corn
,
quadruple
the
harvest
of
hay
,
and
prevent
no
end
of
gold
from
fly
out
of
the
Bank
.
 
<EOS>
also
these
barnacle
be
deal
,
by
the
head
of
the
family
,
like
so
many
card
below
the
court
-
card
,
to
public
meeting
and
dinner
;
where
they
bear
testimony
to
all
sort
of
service
on
the
part
of
their
noble
and
honourable
relative
,
and
butter
the
Barnacles
on
all
sort
of
toast
.
 
<EOS>
and
they
stand
,
under
similar
order
,
at
all
sort
of
election
;
and
they
turn
out
of
their
own
seat
,
on
the
short
notice
and
the
most
unreasonable
term
,
to
let
in
other
man
;
and
they
fetch
and
carry
,
and
toady
and
job
,
and
corrupt
,
and
eat
heap
of
dirt
,
and
be
indefatigable
in
the
public
service
.
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
not
a
list
,
in
all
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
of
place
that
may
fall
vacant
anywhere
within
half
a
century
,
from
a
lord
of
the
Treasury
to
a
chinese
consul
,
and
up
again
to
a
governor
-
general
of
India
,
but
as
applicant
for
such
place
,
the
name
of
some
or
of
every
one
of
these
hungry
and
adhesive
barnacle
be
down
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
necessarily
but
a
sprinkling
of
any
class
of
barnacle
that
attend
the
marriage
,
for
there
be
not
two
score
in
all
,
and
what
be
that
subtract
from
Legion
!
 
<EOS>
but
the
sprinkling
be
a
swarm
in
the
Twickenham
cottage
,
and
fill
it
.
 
<EOS>
a
Barnacle
(
assist
by
a
Barnacle
)
marry
the
happy
pair
,
and
it
behove
Lord
Decimus
Tite
Barnacle
himself
to
conduct
Mrs
Meagles
to
breakfast
.
   
<EOS>
the
entertainment
be
not
as
agreeable
and
natural
as
it
may
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
,
hove
down
by
his
good
company
while
he
highly
appreciate
it
,
be
not
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gowan
be
herself
,
and
that
do
not
improve
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
fiction
that
it
be
not
Mr
Meagles
who
have
stand
in
the
way
,
but
that
it
be
the
Family
greatness
,
and
that
the
Family
greatness
have
make
a
concession
,
and
there
be
now
a
soothing
unanimity
,
pervade
the
affair
,
though
it
be
never
openly
express
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
Barnacles
feel
that
they
for
their
part
would
have
do
with
the
meaglese
when
the
present
patronising
occasion
be
over
;
and
the
Meagleses
feel
the
same
for
their
part
.
 
<EOS>
then
Gowan
assert
his
right
as
a
disappointed
man
who
have
his
grudge
against
the
family
,
and
who
,
perhaps
,
have
allow
his
mother
to
have
them
there
,
as
much
in
the
hope
it
may
give
them
some
annoyance
as
with
any
other
benevolent

put
a

upon

partly
to

no

myself

It
be

strangely
unreal
ride
through

old
squalid
street

with
a
sensation

be
raise
out
of

into
an
airy
world
of
wealth

grandeur

<EOS>
when
Arthur
tell
her
that
she

brightly
through

the

His

no

,
by
her
step
upon
the
stair
,
not
expect
her
until
night

surprised
again

by

Arthur

company

as

the

for
another
half

hour

asleep

last
demonstration
for

time

,
after
shed
some
more
tear

querulously
complain
that
he

into
a
slumber

look
towards
Arthur

come
nearer
to

although

with

they

<EOS>
a
great
deal
of
business
have
likewise
to

do
,
within
the
so

soon

to

orphan
Marshalsea
,
by
Mr

so
long
its
Father
,
chiefly
arise
out
of
application
make
to
him
by
Collegians
for
small
sum
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
to
these
he
respond
with
the
great
liberality
,
and
with
no
lack
of
formality
;
always
first
write
to
appoint
a
time
at
which
the
applicant
may
wait
upon
him
in
his
room
,
and
then
receive
him
in
the
midst
of
a
vast
accumulation
of
document
,
and
accompany
his
donation
(
for
he
say
in
every
such
case
,
"
it
be
a
donation
,
not
a
loan
"
)
with
a
great
deal
of
good
counsel
:
to
the
effect
that
he
,
the
expire
Father
of
the
Marshalsea
,
hope
to
be
long
remember
,
as
an
example
that
a
man
may
preserve
his
own
and
the
general
respect
even
there
.
   
<EOS>
the
Collegians
be
not
envious
.
 
<EOS>
besides
that
they
have
a
personal
and
traditional
regard
for
a
collegian
of
so
many
year
'
standing
,
the
event
be
creditable
to
the
College
,
and
make
it
famous
in
the
newspaper
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
more
of
them
think
,
too
,
than
be
quite
aware
of
it
,
that
the
thing
may
in
the
lottery
of
chance
have
happen
to
themselves
,
or
that
something
of
the
sort
may
yet
happen
to
themselves
some
day
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
They
take
it
very
well
.
<EOS>
a
few
be
low
at
the
thought
of
be
leave
behind
,
and
be
leave
poor
;
but
even
these
do
not
grudge
the
family
their
brilliant
reverse
.
 
<EOS>
there
may
have
be
much
more
envy
in
politer
place
.
<EOS>
It
seem
probable
that
mediocrity
of
fortune
would
have
be
dispose
to
be
less
magnanimous
than
the
Collegians
,
who
live
from
hand
to
mouth
---
from
the
pawnbroker
's
hand
to
the
day
's
dinner
.
   
<EOS>
They
get
up
an
address
to
him
,
which
they
present
in
a
neat
frame
and
glass
(
though
it
be
not
afterwards
display
in
the
family
mansion
or
preserve
among
the
family
paper
)
;
and
to
which
he
return
a
gracious
answer
.
 
<EOS>
in
that
document
he
assure
them
,
in
a
Royal
manner
,
that
he
receive
the
profession
of
their
attachment
with
a
full
conviction
of
its
sincerity
;
and
again
generally
exhort
them
to
follow
his
example
---
which
,
at
least
in
so
far
as
come
into
a
great
property
be
concern
<EOS>
,
there
be
no
doubt
they
would
have
gladly
imitate
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
the
same
occasion
of
invite
them
to
a
comprehensive
entertainment
,
to
be
give
to
the
whole
College
in
the
yard
,
and
at
which
he
signify
he
would
have
the
honour
of
take
a
part
glass
to
the
health
and
happiness
of
all
those
whom
he
be
about
to
leave
behind
.
   
<EOS>
He
do
not
in
person
dine
at
this
public
repast
<EOS>
(
it
take
place
at
two
in
the
afternoon
,
and
his
dinner
now
come
in
from
the
hotel
at
six
)
,
but
his
son
be
so
good
as
to
take
the
head
of
the
principal
table
,
and
to
be
very
free
and
engaging
.
 
<EOS>
He
himself
go
about
among
the
company
,
and
take
notice
of
individual
,
and
see
that
the
viand
be
of
the
quality
he
have
order
,
and
that
all
be
serve
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
whole
,
he
be
like
a
baron
of
the
olden
time
in
a
rare
good
humour
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
conclusion
of
the
repast
,
he
pledge
his
guest
in
a
bumper
of
old
Madeira
;
and
tell
them
that
he
hope
they
have
enjoy
themselves
,
and
what
be
more
,
that
they
would
enjoy
themselves
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
;
that
he
wish
them
well
;
and
that
he
bid
them
welcome
.
   
<EOS>
His
health
be
drunk
with
acclamation

he
be
not
so
baronial
after
all
but
<EOS>
that
in

break
down
,
in
the
manner
of
a
mere
serf
with
a
heart
in
his
breast
,
and
weep
before
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
after
this
great
success
,
which
he
suppose
to
be
a
failure
,
he
give
them

his

no

so
it
be

I
believe

as

know
the
sign

weather
tolerably
well

they
do
not
give
much
employment

out
rather

<EOS>
He
then
go
on
eat
his
veal
with
great
composure
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
enough
of
mock
inconsistency
at
the
bottom
of
this
speech
to
make
it
rather
discordant
,
though
the
manner
be
refine
and
the
person
well

favour

though
the
depreciatory
part

it

skilfully

its

Mrs

She

,
without
disarrange
a
fold
in
her
dress
,
or
displace
a
pin
.
 
<EOS>
if
her
countenance
and
hair
have
rather
a
floury
appearance
,
as
though
from
live
in
some
transcendently
genteel
Mill
,
it
be
rather
because
she
be
a
chalky
creation
altogether

violet
powder
,

have
turn
grey

<EOS>
if
her
eye
have
no

it
be
probably
because
they
have
nothing
to
express

<EOS>
if
she
have
few
wrinkle

it

because
her
mind
have

even
her

could
not
dispute
that

Mrs

way

get
rid

be
to
put
it
out
of
sight
,

make
believe
that
there
be
no
such

<EOS>
this
be
another
of

the
little
that

when
all
these

it
be
Mrs

in

should
---
ha
---
countermand
his
horse
,
and
he
would
---
hum
<EOS>
---
overlook
what
he
have
at
first
suppose
to
be
an
affront
,
but
now
regard
as
an
honour
.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
the
bosom
bent
to
him
;
and
its
owner
,
with
a
wonderful
command
of
feature
,
address
a
win
smile
of
adieu
to
the
two
sister
,
as
young
lady
of
fortune
in
whose
favour
she
be
much
prepossess
,
and
whom
she
have
never
have
the
gratification
of
see
before
.
   
<EOS>
not
so
,
however
,
Mr
Sparkler
.
 
<EOS>
this
gentleman
,
become
transfix
at
the
same
moment
as
his
lady
-
mother
,
could
not
by
any
mean
unfix
himself
again
,
but
stand
stiffly
stare
at
the
whole
composition
with
Miss
Fanny
in
the
Foreground
.
 
<EOS>
on
his
mother
say
,
"
Edmund
,
we
be
quite
ready
;
will
you
give
me
your
arm
?
"
<EOS>
he
seem
,
by
the
motion
of
his
lip
,
to
reply
with
some
remark
comprehend
the
form
of
word
in
which
his
shine
talent
find
the
most
frequent
utterance
,
but
he
relax
no
muscle
.
 
<EOS>
so
fix
be
his
figure
,
that
it
would
have
be
matter
of
some
difficulty
to
bend
him
sufficiently
to
get
him
in
the
carriage
-
door
,
if
he
have
not
receive
the
timely
assistance
of
a
maternal
pull
from
within
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
within
than
the
pad
of
the
little
window
in
the
back
of
the
chariot
disappear
,
and
his
eye
usurp
its
place
.
 
<EOS>
there
it
remain
as
long
as
so
small
an
object
be
discernible
,
and
probably
much
longer
,
stare
(
as
though
something
inexpressibly
surprising
should
happen
to
a
codfish
)
like
an
ill
-
execute
eye
in
a
large
locket
.
   
<EOS>
this
encounter
be
so
highly
agreeable
to
Miss
Fanny
,
and
give
her
so
much
to
think
of
with
triumph
afterwards
,
that
it
soften
her
asperity
exceedingly
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
procession
be
again
in
motion
next
day
,
she
occupy
her
place
in
it
with
a
new
gaiety
;
and
show
such
a
flow
of
spirit
indeed
,
that
Mrs
General
look
rather
surprised
.
   
<EOS>
little
Dorrit
be
glad
to
be
find
no
fault
with
,
and
to
see
that
Fanny
be
pleased
;
but
her
part
in
the
procession
be
a
musing
part
,
and
a
quiet
one
.
 
<EOS>
sit
opposite
her
father
in
the
travelling
-
carriage
,
and
recall
the
old
Marshalsea
room
,
her
present
existence
be
a
dream
.
 
<EOS>
all
that
she
see
be
new
and
wonderful
,
but
it
be
not
real
;
it
seem
to
her
as
if
those
vision
of
mountain
and
picturesque
country
may
melt
away
at
any
moment
,
and
the
carriage
,
turn
some
abrupt
corner
,
bring
up
with
a
jolt
at
the
old
Marshalsea
gate
.
   
<EOS>
to
have
no
work
to
do
be
strange
,
but
not
half
so
strange
as
have
glide
into
a
corner
where
she
have
no
one
to
think
for
,
nothing
to
plan
and
contrive
,
no
care
of
other
to
load
herself
with
.
 
<EOS>
Strange
as
that
be
,
it
be
far
strange
yet
to
find
a
space
between
herself
and
her
father
,
where
other
occupy
themselves
in
take
care
of
him
,
and
where
she
be
never
expect
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
,
this
be
so
much
more
unlike
her
old
experience
than
even
the
mountain
themselves
,
that
she
have
be
unable
to
resign
herself
to
it
,
and
have
try
to
retain
her
old
place
about
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
speak
to
her
alone
,
and
have
say
that
people
---
ha
---
people
in
an
exalted
position
,
my
dear
,
must
scrupulously
exact
respect
from
their
dependent
;
and
that
for
her
,
his
daughter
,
Miss
Amy
Dorrit
,
of
the
sole
remain
branch
of
the
Dorrits
of
Dorsetshire
,
to
be
know
to
---
hum
---
to
occupy
herself
in
fulfil
the
function
of
---
ha
hum
---
a
valet
,
would
be
incompatible
with
that
respect
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
my
dear
,
he
---
ha
---
he
lay
his
parental
injunction
upon
her
,
to
remember
that
she
be
a
lady
,
who
have
now
to
conduct
herself
with
---
hum
---
a
proper
pride
,
and
to
preserve
the
rank
of
a
lady
;
and
consequently
he
request
her
to
abstain
from
do
what
would
occasion
---
ha
---
unpleasant
and
derogatory
remark
.
<EOS>
She
have
obey
without
a
murmur
.
 
<EOS>
thus
it
have
be
bring
about
that
she
now
sit
in
her
corner
of
the
luxurious
carriage
with
her
little
patient
hand
fold
before
her
,
quite
displace
even
from
the
last
point
of
the
old
standing
ground
in
life
on
which
her
foot
have
linger
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
from
this
position
that
all
she
see
appear
unreal
;
the
more
surprising
the
scene
,
the
more
they
resemble
the
unreality
of
her
own
inner
life
as
she
go
through
its
vacant
place
all
day
long
.
 
<EOS>
the
gorge
of
the
Simplon
,
its
enormous
depth
and
thunder
waterfall
,
the
wonderful
road
,
the
point
of
danger
where
a
loose
wheel
or
a
faltering
horse
would
have
be
destruction
,
the
descent
into
Italy
,
the
opening
of
that
beautiful
land
as
the
rugged
mountain
-
chasm
widen
and
let
them
out
from
a
gloomy
and
dark
imprisonment
---
<EOS>
all
a
dream
---
<EOS>
only
the
old
mean
Marshalsea
<EOS>
a
reality
.
 
<EOS>
nay
,
even
the
old
mean
Marshalsea
be
shake
to
its
foundation
when
she
picture
it
without
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
scarcely
believe
that
the
prisoner
be
still
linger
in
the
close
yard
,
that
the
mean
room
be
still
every
one
tenant
,
and
that
the
turnkey
still
stand
in
the
Lodge
let
people
in
and
out
,
all
just
as
she
well
know
it
to
be
.
   
<EOS>
with
a
remembrance
of
her
father
's
old
life
in
prison
hang
about
her
like
the
burden
of
a
sorrowful
tune
,
little
Dorrit
would
wake
from
a
dream
of
her
birth
-
place
into
a
whole
day
's
dream
.
 
<EOS>
the
paint
room
in
which
she
awake
,
often
a
humble
state
-
chamber
in
a
dilapidated
palace
,
would
begin
it
;
with
its
wild
red
autumnal
vine
-
leave
overhang
the
glass
,
its
orange
-
tree
on
the
cracked
white
terrace
outside
the
window
,
a
group
of
monk
and
peasant
in
the
little
street
below
,
misery
and
magnificence
wrestling
with
each
other
upon
every
rood
of
ground
in
the
prospect
,
no
matter
how
widely
diversified
,
and
misery
throw
magnificence
with
the
strength
of
fate
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
would
succeed
a
labyrinth
of
bare
passage
and
pillare
gallery
,
with
the
family
procession
already
prepare
in
the
quadrangle
below
,
through
the
carriage
and
luggage
be
bring
together
by
the
servant
for
the
day
's
journey
.
 
<EOS>
then
breakfast
in
another
paint
chamber
,
damp
-
stain
and
of
desolate
proportion
;
and
then
the
departure
,
which
,
to
her
timidity
and
sense
of
not
be
grand
enough
for
her
place
in
the
ceremony
,
be
always
an
uneasy
thing
.
 
<EOS>
for
then
the
courier
(
who
himself
would
have
be
a
foreign
gentleman
of
high
mark
in
the
Marshalsea
)
would
present
himself
to
report
that
all
be
ready
;
and
then
her
father
's
valet
would
pompously
induct
him
into
his
travelling
-
cloak
;
and
then
Fanny
's
maid
,
and
her
own
maid
(
who
be
a
weight
on
Little
Dorrit
's
mind
---
absolutely
make
her
cry
at
first
<EOS>
,
she
know
so
little
what
to
do
with
her
)
,
would
be
in
attendance
;
and
then
her
brother
's
man
would
complete
his
master
's
equipment
;
and
then
her
father
would
give
his
arm
to
Mrs
General
,
and
her
uncle
would
give
his
to
her
,
and
,
escort
by
the
landlord
and
Inn
servant
,
they
would
swoop
down
-
stair
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
a
crowd
would
be
collect
to
see
them
enter
their
carriage
,
which
,
amidst
much
bowing
,
and
beg
,
and
prance
,
and
lashing
,
and
clatter
,
they
would
do
;
and
so
they
would
be
drive
madly
through
narrow
unsavoury
street
,
and
jerk
out
at
the
town
gate
.
   
<EOS>
among
the
day
's
unreality
would
be
road
where
the
bright
red
vine
be
loop
and
garland
together
on
tree
for
many
mile
;
wood
of
olive
;
white
village
and
town
on
hill
-
side
,
lovely
without
,
but
frightful
in
their
dirt
and
poverty
within
;
crosse
by
the
way
;
deep
blue
lake
with
fairy
island
,
and
cluster
boat
with
awning
of
bright
colour
and
sail
of
beautiful
form
;
vast
pile
of
build
mouldering
to
dust
;
hanging
-
garden
where
the
weed
have
grow
so
strong
that
their
stem
,
like
wedge
drive
home
,
have
split
the
arch
and
rent
the
wall
;
stone

terrace
lane
,
with
the
lizard
run
into
and
out
of
every
chink
;
beggar
of
all
sort
everywhere
:
pitiful
,
picturesque
,
hungry
,
merry
;
child
beggar
and
aged
beggar
.
 
<EOS>
often
at
post
-
house
and
other
halting
place
,
these
miserable
creature
would
appear
to
her
the
only
reality
of
the
day
;
and
many
a
time
,
when
the
money
she
have
bring
to
give
them
be
all
give
away
,
she
would
sit
with
her
folded
hand
,
thoughtfully
look
after
some
diminutive
girl
lead
her
grey
father
,
as
if
the
sight
remind
her
of
something
in
the
day
that
be
go
.
   
<EOS>
again
,
there
would
be
place
where
they
stay
the
week
together
in
splendid
room
,
have
banquet
every
day
,
ride
out
among
heap
of
wonder
,
walk
through
mile
of
palace
,
and
rest
in
dark
corner
of
great
church
;
where
there
be
wink
lamp
of
gold
and
silver
among
pillar
and
arch
,
kneel
figure
dot
about
at
confessional
and
on
the
pavement
;
where
there
be
the
mist
and
scent
of
incense
;
where
there
be
picture
,
fantastic
image
,
gaudy
altar
,
great
height
and
distance
,
all
softly
light
through
stain
glass
,
and
the
massive
curtain
that
hang
in
the
doorway
.
 
<EOS>
from
these
city
they
would
go
on
again
,
by
the
road
of
vine
and
olive
,
through
squalid
village
,
where
there
be
not
a
hovel
without
a
gap
in
its
filthy
wall
,
not
a
window
with
a
whole
inch
of
glass
or
paper
;
where
there
seem
to
be
nothing
to
support
life
,
nothing
to
eat
,
nothing
to
make
,
nothing
to
grow
,
nothing
to
hope
,
nothing
to
do
but
die
.
   
<EOS>
again
they
would
come
to
whole
town
of
palace
,
whose
proper
inmate
be
all
banish
,
and
which
be
all
change
into
barrack
:
<EOS>
troop
of
idle
soldier
lean
out
of
the
state
window
,
where
their
accoutrement
hang
dry
on
the
marble
architecture
,
and
show
to
the
mind
like
host
of
rat
who
be
(
happily
)
eat
away
the
prop
of
the
edifice
that
support
them
,
and
must
soon
,
with
them
,
be
smash
on
the
head
of
the
other
swarm
of
soldier
and
the
swarm
of
priest
,
and
the
swarm
of
spy
,
who
be
all
the
ill
-
look
population
leave
to
be
ruin
,
in
the
street
below
.
   
<EOS>
through
such
scene
,
the
family
procession
move
on
to
Venice
.
 
<EOS>
and
here
it
disperse
for
a
time
,
as
they
be
to
live
in
Venice
some
few
month
in
a
palace
(
itself
six
time
as
big
as
the
whole
Marshalsea
)
on
the
Grand
Canal
.
   
<EOS>
in
this
crowning
unreality
,
where
all
the
street
be
pave
with
water
,
and
where
the
deathlike
stillness
of
the
day
and
night
be
break
by
no
sound
but
the
softened
ringing
of
church
-
bell
,
the
rippling
of
the
current
,
and
the
cry
of
the
gondolier
turn
the
corner
of
the
flow
street
,
Little
Dorrit
,
quite
lose
by
her
task
be
do
,
sit
down
to
muse
.
 
<EOS>
the
family
begin
a
gay
life
,
go
here
and
there
,
and
turn
night
into
day
;
but
she
be
timid
of
join
in
their
gaiety
,
and
only
ask
leave
to
be
leave
alone
.
   
<EOS>
sometimes
she
would
step
into
one
of
the
gondola
that
be
always
keep
in
wait
,
moor
to
paint
post
at
the
door
---
when
she
could
escape
from
the
attendance
of
that
oppressive
maid
,
who
be
her
mistress
,
and
a
very
hard
one
---
and
would
be
take
all
over
the
strange
city
.
 
<EOS>
social
people
in
other
gondola
begin
to
ask
each
other
who
the
little
solitary
girl
be
whom
they
pass
,
sit
in
her
boat
with
folded
hand
,
look
so
pensively
and
wonderingly
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
never
think
that
it
would
be
worth
anybody
's
while
to
notice
her
or
her
doing
,
Little
Dorrit
,
in
her
quiet
,
scared
,
lost
manner
,
go
about
the
city
none
the
less
.
   
<EOS>
but
her
favourite
station
be
the
balcony
of
her
own
room
,
overhang
the
canal
,
with
other
balcony
below
,
and
none
above
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
massive
stone
darken
by
age
,
build
in
a
wild
fancy
which
come
from
the
East
to
that
collection
of
wild
fancy
;
and
Little
Dorrit
be
little
indeed
,
lean
on
the
broad
-
cushioned
ledge
,
and
look
over
.
 
<EOS>
as
she
like
no
place
of
an
evening
half
so
well
,
she
soon
begin
to
be
watch
for
,
and
many
eye
in
pass
gondola
be
raise
,
and
many
people
say
,
there
be
the
little
figure
of
the
english
girl
who
be
always
alone
.
   
<EOS>
such
people
be
not
reality
to
the
little
figure
of
the
english
girl
;
such
people
be
all
unknown
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
watch
the
sunset
,
in
its
long
low
line
of
purple
and
red
,
and
its
burn
flush
high
up
into
the
sky
:
so
glow
on
the
building
,
and
so
lighten
their
structure
,
that
it
make
them
look
as
if
their
strong
wall
be
transparent
,
and
they
shine
from
within
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
watch
those
glory
expire
;
and
then
,
after
look
at
the
black
gondola
underneath
,
take
guest
to
music
and
dancing
,
would
raise
her
eye
to
the
shine
star
.
 
<EOS>
be
there
no
party
of
her
own
,
in
other
time
,
on
which
the
star
have
shine
?
 
<EOS>
to
think
of
that
old
gate
now
!
 
<EOS>
She
would
think
of
that
old
gate
,
and
of
herself
sit
at
it
in
the
dead
of
the
night
,
pillow
Maggy
's
head
;
and
of
other
place
and
of
other
scene
associate
with
those
different
time
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
she
would
lean
upon
her
balcony
,
and
look
over
at
the
water
,
as
though
they
all
lie
underneath

musingly
watch
its

run
dry

show
her
the
prison

herself

the
old

<EOS>
a
letter
from
little
Dorrit
 
dear
Mr
Clennam
,
   
<EOS>
I
write
to
you
from
my
own
room
at
Venice
,
think
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
know
you
can
not
be
so
glad
to
hear
from
me
as
I
be
to
write
to
you
;
for
everything
about
you
be
as
you
have
be
accustom
to
see
it
,
and
you
miss
nothing
---
unless
it
should
be
me
,
which
can
only
be
for
a
very
little
while
together
and
very
seldom
---
while
everything
in
my
life
be
so
strange
,
and
I
miss
so
much
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
be
in
Switzerland
,
which
appear
to
have
be
year
ago
,
though
it
be
only
week
,
I
meet
young
Mrs
Gowan
,
who
be
on
a
mountain
excursion
like
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
She
tell
me
she
be
very
well
and
very
happy
.
 
<EOS>
She
send
you
the
message
,
by
me
,
that
she
thank
you
affectionately
and
would
never
forget
you
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
quite
confiding
with
me
,
and
I
love
her
almost
as
soon
as
I
speak
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
nothing
singular
in
that
;
who
could
help
love
so
beautiful
and
win
a
creature
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
wonder
at
any
one
love
her
.
 
<EOS>
no
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
It
will
not
make
you
uneasy
on
Mrs
Gowan
's
account
<EOS>
,
I
hope
---
<EOS>
for
I
remember
that
you
say
you
have
the
interest
of
a
true
friend
in
her
---
if
I
tell
you
that
I
wish
she
could
have
marry
some
one
better
suit
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gowan
seem
fond
of
her
,
and
of
course
she
be
very
fond
of
him
,
but
I
think
he
be
not
earnest
enough
---
I
do
not
mean
in
that
respect
---
I
mean
in
anything
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
keep
it
out
of
my
mind
that
if
I
be
Mrs
Gowan
(
what
a
change
that
would
be
,
and
how
I
must
alter
to
become
like
her
!
)
<EOS>
I
should
feel
that
I
be
rather
lonely
and
lose
,
for
the
want
of
some
one
who
be
steadfast
and
firm
in
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
I
even
think
she
feel
this
want
a
little
,
almost
without
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
mind
you
be
not
make
uneasy
by
this
,
for
she
be
"
very
well
and
very
happy
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
she
look
most
beautiful
.
   
<EOS>
I
expect
to
meet
her
again
before
long
,
and
indeed
have
be
expect
for
some
day
past
to
see
her
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
ever
be
as
good
a
friend
to
her
as
I
can
for
your
sake
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
Mr
Clennam
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
you
think
little
of
have
be
a
friend
to
me
when
I
have
no
other
(
not
that
I
have
any
other
now
,
for
I
have
make
no
new
friend
)
,
but
<EOS>
I
think
much
of
it
,
and
I
never
can
forget
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
wish
I
know
---
but
it
be
good
for
no
one
to
write
to
me
---
how
Mr
and
Mrs
Plornish
prosper
in
the
business
which
my
dear
father
buy
for
them
,
and
that
old
Mr
Nandy
live
happily
with
them
and
his
two
grandchild
,
and
sing
all
his
song
over
and
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
quite
keep
back
the
tear
from
my
eye
when
I
think
of
my
poor
Maggy
,
and
of
the
blank
<EOS>
she
must
have
feel
at
first
,
however
kind
they
all
be
to
her
,
without
her
Little
Mother
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
go
and
tell
her
,
as
a
strict
secret
,
with
my
love
,
that
she
never
can
have
regret
our
separation
more
than
I
have
regret
it
?
 
<EOS>
and
will
you
tell
them
all
that
I
have
think
of
them
every
day
,
and
that
my
heart
be
faithful
to
them
everywhere
?
 
<EOS>
o
,
if
you
could
know
how
faithful
,
you
would
almost
pity
me
for
be
so
far
away
and
be
so
grand
!
   
<EOS>
You
will
be
glad
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
,
to
know
that
my
dear
father
be
very
well
in
health
,
and
that
all
these
change
be
highly
beneficial
to
him
,
and
that
he
be
very
different
indeed
from
what
he
use
to
be
when
you
use
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
improvement
in
my
uncle
too
,
I
think
,
though
he
never
complain
of
old
,
and
never
exult
now
.
<EOS>
Fanny
be
very
graceful
,
quick
,
and
clever
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
natural
to
her
to
be
a
lady
;
she
have
adapt
herself
to
our
new
fortune
with
wonderful
ease
.
   
<EOS>
this
remind
me
that
I
have
not
be
able
to
do
so
,
and
that
I
sometimes
almost
despair
of
ever
be
able
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
that
I
can
not
learn
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
General
be
always
with
us
,
and
we
speak
French
and
speak
italian
,
and
she
take
pain
to
form
us
in
many
way
.
<EOS>
when
I
say
we
speak
french
and
italian
,
I
mean
they
do
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
I
be
so
slow
that
I
scarcely
get
on
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
begin
to
plan
,
and
think
,
and
try
,
all
my
planning
,
think
,
and
try
go
in
old
direction
,
and
I
begin
to
feel
careful
again
about
the
expense
of
the
day
,
and
about
my
dear
father
,
and
about
my
work
,
and
then
I
remember
with
a
start
that
there
be
no
such
care
leave
,
and
that
in
itself
be
so
new
and
improbable
that
it
set
me
wander
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
the
courage
to
mention
this
to
any
one
but
you
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
the
same
with
all
these
new
country
and
wonderful
sight
.
<EOS>
They
be
very
beautiful
,
and
they
astonish
me
,
but
I
be
not
collect
enough
---
not
familiar
enough
with
myself
,
if
you
can
quite
understand
what
I
mean
---
to
have
all
the
pleasure
in
them
that
I
may
have
.
 
<EOS>
what
I
know
before
them
,
blend
with
them
,
too
,
so
curiously
.
 
<EOS>
for
instance
,
when
we
be
among
the
mountain
,
I
often
feel
(
I
hesitate
to
tell
such
an
idle
thing
,
<EOS>
dear
Mr
Clennam
,
even
to
you
)
as
if
the
Marshalsea
must
be
behind
that
great
rock
;
or
as
if
Mrs
Clennam
's
room
where
I
have
work
so
many
day
,
and
where
I
first
see
you
,
must
be
just
beyond
that
snow
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
remember
one
night
when
I
come
with
Maggy
to
your
lodging
in
Covent
Garden
?
<EOS>
that
room
I
have
often
and
often
fancy
I
have
see
before
me
,
travel
along
for
mile
by
the
side
of
our
carriage
,
when
I
have
look
out
of
the
carriage
-
window
after
dark
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
shut
out
that
night
,
and
sit
at
the
iron
gate
,
and
walk
about
till
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
often
look
up
at
the
star
,
even
from
the
balcony
of
this
room
,
and
believe
that
I
be
in
the
street
again
,
shut
out
with
Maggy
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
same
with
people
that
I
leave
in
England
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
go
about
here
in
a
gondola
,
I
surprise
myself
look
into
other
gondola
as
if
I
hope
to
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
overcome
me
with
joy
to
see
them
,
but
I
do
not
think
it
would
surprise
me
much
,
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
in
my
fanciful
time
,
I
fancy
that
they
may
be
anywhere
;
and
I
almost
expect
to
see
their
dear
face
on
the
bridge
or
the
quay
.
   
<EOS>
another
difficulty
that
I
have
will
seem
very
strange
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
seem
very
strange
to
any
one
but
me
,
and
do
even
to
me
:
I
often
feel
the
old
sad
pity
for
---
I
need
not
write
the
word
---
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
change
as
he
be
,
and
inexpressibly
blest
and
thankful
as
I
always
be
to
know
it
,
the
old
sorrowful
feeling
of
compassion
come
upon
me
sometimes
with
such
strength
that
I
want
to
put
my
arm
<EOS>
round
his
neck
,
tell
him
how
I
love
him
,
and
cry
a
little
on
his
breast
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
glad
after
that
,
and
proud
and
happy
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
know
that
I
must
not
do
this
;
that
he
would
not
like
it
,
that
Fanny
would
be
angry
,
that
Mrs
General
would
be
amazed
;
and
so
I
quiet
myself
.
 
<EOS>
yet
in
do
so
,
I
struggle
with
the
feeling
that
I
have
come
to
be
at
a
distance
from
him
;
and
that
even
in
the
midst
of
all
the
servant
and
attendant
,
he
be
desert
,
and
in
want
of
me
.
   
<EOS>
dear
Mr
Clennam
,
I
have
write
a
great
deal
about
myself
,
but
I
must
write
a
little
more
still
,
or
what
I
want
most
of
all
to
say
in
this
weak
letter
would
be
leave
out
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
these
foolish
thought
of
mine
,
which
I
have
be
so
hardy
as
to
confess
to
you
because
I
know
you
will
understand
me
if
anybody
can
,
and
will
make
more
allowance
for
me
than
anybody
else
<EOS>
would
if
you
can
not
---
in
all
these
thought
,
there
be
one
think
scarcely
ever
---
never
---
out
of
my
memory
,
and
that
be
that
I
hope
you
sometimes
,
in
a
quiet
moment
,
have
a
thought
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
that
as
to
this
,
I
have
feel
,
ever
since
I
have
be
away
,
an
anxiety
which
I
be
very
anxious
to
relieve
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
afraid
that
you
may
think
of
me
in
a
new
light
,
or
a
new
character
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
do
that
,
I
could
not
bear
that
---
it
would
make
me
more
unhappy
than
you
can
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
break
my
heart
to
believe
that
you
think
of
me
in
any
way
that
would
make
me
strange
to
you
than
I
be
when
you
be
so
good
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
what
I
have
to
pray
and
entreat
of
you
be
,
that
you
will
never
think
of
me
as
the
daughter
of
a
rich
person
;
that
you
will
never
think
of
me
as
dress
any
better
,
or
live
any
better
,
than
when
you
first
know
me
.
 
<EOS>
that
you
will
remember
me
only
as
the
little
shabby
girl
you
protect
with
so
much
tenderness
,
from
whose
threadbare
dress
you
have
keep
away
the
rain
,
and
whose
wet
foot
you
have
dry
at
your
fire
.
 
<EOS>
that
you
will
think
of
me
(
when
you
think
of
me
at
all
)
,
and
of
my
true
affection
and
devoted
gratitude
,
always
without
change
,
as
of
your
poor
child

I

express

I
have
mention
to
her
that
it
be
well
not

<EOS>
I
have
point
out
to
her
that
the
celebrated
Mr

not

of

that
he

I

You
do
me
the
honour

It

appear

me
(
if

should
prove

a
baseless
assumption

I
shall
be
pardon

that

Mr

look
severely
at
him

also
keep
a
jealous
eye
upon
him
until
he
go
out
at
the
door
,
mistrust
that
he
may
have
something
in
his
mind
prejudicial
to
the
family
dignity
;
that
he
may
have
even
get
wind
of
some
collegiate
joke
before
he
come
into
the
service

may
be
derisively
revive
its
remembrance

if

however
faintly

nothing
would
have
persuade
Mr

that

as

happen

very
fortunately

he
escape

danger

announce
Miss
Amy

<EOS>
little
Dorrit

whether
speaking

her
quiet
earnestness

It
have
not

for
a
passing
moment
,
until

but
now
that

alone
with
him
the
finger
of
her
lightly
fold
hand
be
agitate
,
and
there
be
repress
emotion
in
her
face

not

<EOS>
She
may
feel
a
little
wounded
,
but
her
care
be
not

<EOS>
Her
thought
still
turn
,
as
they
always
have
turn
,
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
a
faint
misgiving
,
which
have
hang
about
her
since
their
accession
to
fortune
,
that
even
now
she
could
never
see
him
as
he
use
to
be
before
the
prison
day
,
have
gradually
begin
to
assume
form
in
her
mind
.
 
<EOS>
She
feel
that
,
in
what
he
have
just
now
say
to
her
and
in
his
whole
bearing
towards
her
,
there
be
the
well
-
know
shadow
of
the
Marshalsea
wall
.
 
<EOS>
It
take
a
new
shape
,
but
it
be
the
old
sad
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
She
begin
with
sorrowful
unwillingness
to
acknowledge
to
herself
that
she
be
not
strong
enough
to
keep
off
the
fear
that
no
space
in
the
life
of
man
could
overcome
that
quarter
of
a
century
behind
the
prison
bar
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
no
blame
to
bestow
upon
him
,
therefore
:
nothing
to
reproach
him
with
,
no
emotion
in
her
faithful
heart
but
great
compassion
and
unbounded
tenderness
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
why
it
be
,
that
,
even
as
he
sit
before
her
on
his
sofa
,
in
the
brilliant
light
of
a
bright
italian
day
,
the
wonderful
city
without
and
the
splendour
of
an
old
palace
within
,
she
see
him
at
the
moment
in
the
long
-
familiar
gloom
of
his
Marshalsea
lodging
,
and
wish
to
take
her
seat
beside
him
,
and
comfort
him
,
and
be
again
full
of
confidence
with
him
,
and
of
usefulness
to
him

<EOS>
if
he
divine
what
be
in
her
thought
,
his
own
be
not

it

<EOS>
after

uneasy
move
in

he
get
up

about

<EOS>
He
have
be
run
down
by
jerk

during
his
last
speech

like
a
sort
of
ill

adjust
alarum
.
 
<EOS>
the
touch
be
still
upon
his
arm

<EOS>
He
fall
silent
;
and
after
look
about
the
ceiling
again
for
a
little
while
,
look
down
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
Her
head
droop
,
and
he
could
not
see
her
face
;
but
her
touch
be
tender
and
quiet
,
and
in
the
expression
of
her
deject
figure
there
be
no
blame

nothing
but
love

<EOS>
He
begin
to
whimper
,
just
as
he
have
do
that
night
in
the
prison
when
she
afterwards
sit
at
his
bedside
till
morning
;
exclaim
that
he
be
a
poor
ruin

a
poor
wretch
in
the
midst
of
his
wealth

clasp
her
in

to
him

<EOS>
His
tear
be
soon
dry
,
much
sooner
than
on
the
former
occasion
;
and
he
be
presently
afterwards
very
high
with
his
valet
,
as
a
way
of
right
himself

have
shed
any

with
one
remarkable
exception

freedom

when
he
speak
to
his

day

,
now
,
the
breakfast
hour
arrive

<EOS>
with
it
Miss
Fanny
from
her
apartment
,

Mr
Edward
from
his
apartment

<EOS>
both
these
young
person
of
distinction
be
something
the
bad
for
late
hour
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
Miss
Fanny
,
she
have
become
the
victim
of
an
insatiate
mania
for
what
she
call
"
go
into
society
;
"
and
would
have
go
into
it
head
-
foremost
fifty
time
between
sunset
and
sunrise
,
if
so
many
opportunity
have
be
at
her
disposal

<EOS>
as
to
Mr

he
,
too
,
have
a
large
acquaintance

and
be
generally
engage
(
for
the
most
part

in
dice
circle
,
or
other
of
a
kindre
nature
)
,
during
the
great
part
of
every
night

for
this
gentleman
,
when
his
fortune
change
,
have
stand
at
the
great
advantage
of
be
already
prepare
for
the
high
associate
,
and
have
little
to
learn

so
much
be
he
indebte
to
the
happy
accident
which
have
make
him
acquaint
with
horse

deal
and
billiard

marking

as
the
old
gentleman
inhabit
the
high
story
of
the
palace
,
where
he
may
have
practise
pistol
-
shooting
without
much
chance
of
discovery
by
the
other
inmate
,
his
young
niece
have
take
courage
to
propose
the
restoration
to
him
of
his
clarionet
,
which
Mr
Dorrit
have
order
to
be
confiscate
,
but
which
she
have
venture
to
preserve
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
some
objection
from
Miss
Fanny
,
that
it
be
a
low
instrument
,
and
that
she
detest
the
sound
of
it
,
the
concession
have
be
make
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
then
discover
that
he
have
have
enough
of
it
,
and
never
play
it
,
now
that
it
be
no
longer
his
mean
of
get
bread
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
insensibly
acquire
a
new
habit
of
shuffling
into
the
picture
-
gallery
,
always
with
his
twist
paper
of
snuff
in
his
hand
(
much
to
the
indignation
of
Miss
Fanny
,
who
have
propose
the
purchase
of
a
gold
box
for
him
that
the
family
may
not
be
discredit
,
which
he
have
absolutely
refuse
to
carry
when
it
be
buy

;
and
of
pass
hour
and
hour
before
the
portrait
of
renowned
venetian
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
never
make
out
what
his
dazed
eye
see
in
them
;
whether
he
have
an
interest
in
them
merely
as
picture
,
or
whether
he
confusedly
identify
them
with
a
glory
that
be
depart
,
like
the
strength
of
his
own
mind
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
pay
his
court
to
them
with
great
exactness
,
and
clearly
derive
pleasure
from
the
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
after
the
first
few
day
,
Little
Dorrit
happen
one
morning
to
assist
at
these
attention
.
 
<EOS>
It
so
evidently
heighten
his
gratification
that
she
often
accompany
him
afterwards
,
and
the
great
delight
of
which
the
old
man
have
show
himself
susceptible
since
his
ruin
,
arise
out
of
these
excursion
,
when
he
would
carry
a
chair
about
for
her
from
picture
to
picture
,
and
stand
behind
it
,
in
spite
of
all
her
remonstrance
,
silently
present
her
to
the
noble
venetian

Mrs

she
be
not
in

to
varnish
the
present
article
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
only
remark
,
as
a
general
principle
observe
in
the
varnish
trade
,
that
much
depend
on
the
quarter
from
which
the
lady
under
consideration
be
accredit
to
a
family
so
conspicuously
niche
in
the
social
temple
as
the
family
of
Dorrit

at

remark
the
face

Mr

He
be
about

<EOS>
something
<EOS>
right
<EOS>
somewhere
 
to
be
in
the
halting
state
of
Mr
Henry
Gowan
;
to
have
leave
one
of
two
power
in
disgust
;
to
want
the
necessary
qualification
for
find
promotion
with
another
,
and
to
be
loiter
moodily
about
on
neutral
ground
,
curse
both
;
be
to
be
in
a
situation
unwholesome
for
the
mind
,
<EOS>
which
time
be
not
likely
to
improve
.
 
<EOS>
the
bad
class
of
sum
work
in
the
every
-
day
world
be
cypher
by
the
disease
arithmetician
who
be
always
in
the
rule
of
Subtraction
as
to
the
merit
and
success
of
other
,
and
never
in
addition
as
to
their
own
.
   
<EOS>
the
habit
,
too
,
of
seek
some
sort
of
recompense
in
the
discontent
boast
of
be
disappoint
,
be
a
habit
fraught
with
degeneracy
.
 
<EOS>
a
certain
idle
carelessness
and
recklessness
of
consistency
soon
come
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
to
bring
deserve
thing
down
by
set
undeserve
thing
up
be
one
of
its
perverted
delight
;
and
there
be
no
play
fast
and
loose
with
the
truth
,
in
any
game
,
without
grow
the
bad
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
in
his
expressed
opinion
of
all
performance
in
the
art
of
painting
that
be
completely
destitute
of
merit
,
Gowan
be
the
most
liberal
fellow
on
earth
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
declare
such
a
man
to
have
more
power
in
his
little
finger
(
provide
he
have
none
)
,
than
such
another
have
(
provide
he
have
much
)
in
his
whole
mind
and
body
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
objection
be
take
that
the
thing
commend
be
trash
,
he
would
reply
,
on
behalf
of
his
art
,
"
My
good
fellow
,
what
do
we
all
turn
out
but
trash
?
 
<EOS>
I
turn
out
nothing
else
,
and
I
make
you
a
present
of
the
confession
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
to
make
a
vaunt
of
be
poor
be
another
of
the
incident
of
his
splenetic
state
,
though
this
may
have
have
the
design
in
it
of
show
that
he
ought
to
be
rich
;
just
as
he
would
publicly
laud
and
decry
the
Barnacles
,
lest
it
should
be
forget
that
he
belong
to
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
Howbeit
,
these
two
subject
be
very
often
on
his
lip
;
and
he
manage
them
so
well
that
he
may
have
praise
himself
by
the
month
together
,
and
not
have
make
himself
out
half
so
important
a
man
as
he
do
by
his
light
disparagement
of
his
claim
on
anybody
's
consideration
.
   
<EOS>
out
of
this
same
airy
talk
of
his
,
it
always
soon
come
to
be
understand
,
wherever
he
and
his
wife
go
,
that
he
have
marry
against
the
wish
of
his
exalted
relation
,
and
have
have
much
ado
to
prevail
on
them
to
countenance
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
make
the
representation
,
on
the
contrary
seem
to
laugh
the
idea
to
scorn
;
but
it
do
happen
that
,
with
all
his
pain
to
depreciate
himself
,
he
be
always
in
the
superior
position
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
day
of
their
honeymoon
,
Minnie
Gowan
feel
sensible
of
be
usually
regard
as
the
wife
of
a
man
who
have
make
a
descent
in
marry
her
,
but
whose
chivalrous
love
for
her
have
cancel
that
inequality
.
   
<EOS>
to
Venice
they
have
be
accompany
by
Monsieur
Blandois
of
Paris
,
and
at
Venice
Monsieur
Blandois
of
Paris
be
very
much
in
the
society
of
Gowan
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
have
first
meet
this
gallant
gentleman
at
Geneva
,
Gowan
have
be
undecide
whether
to
kick
him
or
encourage
him
;
and
have
remain
for
about
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
,
so
troubled
to
settle
the
point
to
his
satisfaction
,
that
he
have
think
of
toss
up
a
five
-
franc
piece
on
the
term
,
"
tail
,
kick
;
head
,
encourage
,
"
and
abide
by
the
voice
of
the
oracle
.
<EOS>
It
chance
,
however
,
that
his
wife
express
a
dislike
to
the
engage
Blandois
,
and
that
the
balance
of
feeling
in
the
hotel
be
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
upon
it
,
Gowan
resolve
to
encourage
him
.
   
<EOS>
why
this
perversity
,
if
it
be
not
in
a
generous
fit
?
---
which
it
be
not
.
 
<EOS>
why
should
Gowan
,
very
much
the
superior
of
Blandois
of
Paris
,
and
very
well
able
to
pull
that
prepossess
gentleman
to
piece
and
find
out
the
stuff
he
be
make
of
,
take
up
with
such
a
man
?
 
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
he
oppose
the
first
separate
wish
he
observe
in
his
wife
,
because
her
father
have
pay
his
debt
and
it
be
desirable
to
take
an
early
opportunity
of
assert
his
independence
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
second
place
,
he
oppose
the
prevalent
feeling
,
because
with
many
capacity
of
be
otherwise
,
he
be
an
ill
-
condition
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
find
a
pleasure
in
declare
that
a
courtier
with
the
refined
manner
of
Blandois
ought
to
rise
to
the
great
distinction
in
any
polished
country
.
 
<EOS>
He
find
a
pleasure
in
set
up
Blandois
as
the
type
of
elegance
,
and
make
him
a
satire
upon
other
who
pique
themselves
on
personal
grace
.
 
<EOS>
He
seriously
protest
that
the
bow
of
Blandois
be
perfect
,
that
the
address
of
Blandois
be
irresistible
,
and
that
the
picturesque
ease
of
Blandois
would
be
cheaply
purchase
(
if
it
be
not
a
gift
,
and
unpurchasable
)
for
a
hundred
thousand
franc
.
 
<EOS>
that
exaggeration
in
the
manner
of
the
man
which
have
be
notice
as
appertain
to
him
and
to
every
such
man
,
whatever
his
original
breeding
,
as
certainly
as
the
sun
belong
to
this
system
,
be
acceptable
to
Gowan
as
a
caricature
,
which
he
find
it
a
humorous
resource
to
have
at
hand
for
the
ridiculing
of
number
of
people
who
necessarily
do
more
or
less
of
what
Blandois
overdid
.
 
<EOS>
thus
he
have
take
up
with
him
;
and
thus
,
negligently
strengthen
these
inclination
with
habit
,
and
idly
derive
some
amusement
from
his
talk
,
he
have
glide
into
a
way
of
have
him
for
a
companion
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
though
he
suppose
him
to
live
by
his
wit
at
play
-
table
and
the
like
;
though
he
suspect
him
to
be
a
coward
,
while
he
himself
be
daring
and
courageous
;
though
he
thoroughly
know
him
to
be
dislike
by
Minnie
;
and
though
he
care
so
little
for
him
,
after
all
,
that
if
he
have
give
her
any
tangible
personal
cause
to
regard
him
with
aversion
,
he
would
have
have
no
compunction
<EOS>
whatever
in
fling
him
out
of
the
high
window
in
Venice
into
the
deep
water
of
the
city

<EOS>
little
Dorrit
would
have
be
glad
to
make
her
visit

Mrs
Gowan

as
Fanny

in
truth

high
for

Fanny

fearfully

a
number
of

at

grotesquely

like
rotten

full

bewilderment
of

wretched

reveal

even
in

very
fondness

too
much

seem
so
unsuspicious
of

depth

must
lie
below

surface

that
she
doubt
if
there
could
be
any
such
depth
in
himself

She
wonder
whether
his
want
of
earnestness
may
be
the
natural
result
of
his
want
of
such
quality

whether
it
be
with
people
as
with
ship

that
,
in

shallow

rocky
water

their
anchor
have
no

they
drift
anywhere

down

for
the
poor
quarter

,
put
her
arm
round
her

a
playfully
affectionate
way

me

my

She

with

She

insolent

false
as

him
come

get
it
thoroughly
into
his
most
ridiculous
of
all
ridiculous
noddle

the
deception

"
no

Mr

<EOS>
this

long
word

It

<EOS>
the
exquisitely
bold
and
original
thought
present
itself
to
Mr

that
there
be
an
opening
here
for

there
be
some
of
the
family
(

to
whom
no

could
render
justice

,
for

to
express
the
idea

it
return
to
the
sky

<EOS>
this
be
the
more
to
be
regret
as
Miss
Fanny
greatly
applaud
the
notion
of
the
portrait

urge
her
papa
to
act
upon
it

She
surmise

that
Mr

have

his

so
delightfully
interesting

sometimes

distinction

chuckle
aloud

necessity

glide
out

call

as

It

the
natural

of
his

so
much

<EOS>
Mr

then
mention
his
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
Gowan
,
laughing
,
after
receive
it
gracefully
enough
,
"
I
be
new
to
the
trade

and
not
expert
at
its
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
ought
to
look
at
you
in
various
light
,
tell
you
you
be
a
capital
subject
,
and
consider
when
I
shall
be
sufficiently
disengage
to
devote
myself
with
the
necessary
enthusiasm
to
the
fine
picture
I
mean
to
make
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
"
and
he
laugh
again
,
"
I
feel
quite
a
traitor
in

,
by
not
do
the

<EOS>
but
I
have
not

bring
up
to
it

and
it
be
too
late
to
learn
it
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
the
fact
be
,
I
be
a
very
bad
painter
,
but
not
much
bad
than
the
generality
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
go
to
throw
away
a
hundred
guinea
or
<EOS>
so
,
I
be
as
poor
as

usually
be

I
shall
be
very
much
oblige

you

will
throw

away
upon

<EOS>
I
will
do
the
good
I
can
for
the
money
;
and
if
the
good
should
be
bad
,
why
even
then
,
you
may
probably
have
a
bad
picture
with
a
small
name
to
it
,
instead
of
a
bad
picture
with
a
large
name
to
it

"
   
<EOS>
this
tone
,
though
not
what
he
have
expect
,
on
the
whole
suited
Mr
Dorrit
remarkably
well
.
 
<EOS>
It
show
that
the
gentleman
,
highly
connected
,
and
not
a

workman
,
would
be
under
an
obligation

him

<EOS>
He
express
his
satisfaction
in

himself
in

he
would
have
the
pleasure

character

"
You

"
these
remark
be
not
less
favourably
receive
by
Mr
Dorrit
than
their
predecessor
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
the
prelude
to
the
first
reception
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Gowan
at
dinner
,
and
they
skilfully
place
Gowan
on
his
usual
ground
in
the
new
family
.
   
<EOS>
His
wife
,
too
,
they
place
on
her
usual
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Fanny
understand
,
with
particular
distinctness
,
that
Mrs
Gowan
's
good
look
have
cost
her
husband
very
dear
;
that
there
have
be
a
great
disturbance
about
her
in
the
Barnacle
family
;
and
that
the
Dowager
Mrs
Gowan
,
nearly
heart
-
break
,
have
resolutely
set
her
face
against
the
marriage
until
overpower
by
her
maternal
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
General
likewise
clearly
understand
that
the
attachment
have
occasion
much
family
grief
and
dissension
.
 
<EOS>
of
honest
Mr
Meagles
no
mention
be
make
;
except
that
it
be
natural
enough
that
a
person
of
that
sort
should
wish
to
raise
his
daughter
out
of
his
own
obscurity
,
and
that
no
one
could
blame
him
for
try
his
good
to
do
so
.
   
<EOS>
little
Dorrit
's
interest
in
the
fair
subject
of
this
easily
accept
belief
be
too
earnest
and
watchful
to
fail
in
accurate
observation
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
see
that
it
have
its
part
in
throw
upon
Mrs
Gowan
the
touch
of
a
shadow
under
which
she
live
,
and
she
even
have
an
instinctive
knowledge
that
there
be
not
the
least
truth
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
have
an
influence
in
place
obstacle
in
the
way
of
her
association
with
Mrs
Gowan
by
make
the
Prunes
and
Prism
school
excessively
polite
to
her
,
but
not
very
intimate
with
her
;
and
Little
Dorrit
,
as
an
enforced
sizar
of
that
college
,
be
oblige
to
submit
herself
humbly
to
its
ordinance
.
   
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
there
be
a
sympathetic
understanding
already
establish
between
the
two
,
which
would
have
carry
them
over
great
difficulty
,
and
make
a
friendship
out
of
a
more
restricted
intercourse
.
 
<EOS>
as
though
accident
be
determine
to
be
favourable
to
it
,
they
have
a
new
assurance
of
congeniality
in
the
aversion
which
each
perceive
that
the
other
feel
towards
Blandois
of
Paris
;
an
aversion
amount
to
the
repugnance
and
horror
of
a
natural
antipathy
towards
an
odious
creature
of
the
reptile
kind
.
   
<EOS>
and
there
be
a
passive
congeniality
between
them
,
besides
this
active
one
.
 
<EOS>
to
both
of
them
,
Blandois
behave
in
exactly
the
same
manner
;
and
to
both
of
them
his
manner
have
uniformly
something
in
it
,
which
they
both
know
to
be
different
from
his
bearing
towards
other
.
 
<EOS>
the
difference
be
too
minute
in
its
expression
to
be
perceive
by
other
,
but
they
know
it
to
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
a
mere
trick
of
his
evil
eye
,
a
mere
turn
of
his
smooth
white
hand
,
a
mere
hair's
-
breadth
of
addition
to
the
fall
of
his
nose
and
the
rise
of
the
moustache
in
the
most
frequent
movement
of
his
face
,
convey
to
both
of
them
,
equally
,
a
swagger
personal
to
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
he
have
say
,
"
I
have
a
secret
power
in
this
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
this
have
never
be
feel
by
them
both
in
so
great
a
degree
,
and
never
by
each
so
perfectly
to
the
knowledge
of
the
other
,
as
on
a
day
when
he
come
to
Mr
Dorrit
's
to
take
his
leave
before
quit
Venice
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gowan
be
herself
there
for
the

purpose
,
and
he
come
upon
the
two
together
;
the
rest
of
the
family
be
out
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
have
not
be
together
five
minute
,
and
the
peculiar
manner
seem
to
convey
to
them
,
"
You
be
go
to
talk
about
me

<EOS>
ha

Behold

<EOS>
"
Gowan

Blandois

with
a
smile

Mrs

reply
he
be
not

<EOS>
"
not

"
say
Blandois

<EOS>
"
permit
your

Blandois

<EOS>
"
then
I
be
forlorn

"
   
<EOS>
that
he
may
be
;
but
he
be
not
so
forlorn
as
to
roam
away
and
leave
them
together
.
 
<EOS>
He
sit
entertain
them
with
his
fine
compliment
,
and
his
choice
conversation
;
but
he
convey
to
them
,
all
the
time
,
"
no

no
,
no
,
dear
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Behold
me
here
expressly
to
prevent
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
convey
it
to
them
with
so
much
meaning
,
and
he
have
such
a
diabolical
persistency
in
him
,
that
at
length
,
Mrs
Gowan
rise
to
depart
.
 
<EOS>
on
his
offer
his
hand
to
Mrs
Gowan
to
lead
her
down
the
staircase
,
she
retain
Little
Dorrit
's
hand
in
her
,
with
a
cautious
pressure
,
and
say
,
"
no

thank
you

<EOS>
but
,
if
you
will
please
to
see
if
my
boatman
be
there

I
shall
be
oblige

you

<EOS>
It
leave
him
no
choice
but
to
go
down
before
them

<EOS>
as
he
do
so
,
hat
in

<EOS>
,
Mrs
Gowan
whisper
:

do
Mr

do

He
will
turn
his

moment

<EOS>
no

I
be
sure
he
do
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
think
so

"
little
Dorrit
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Henry
like
him
,
and
he
will
not

ill
of

he
be
so
generous

open
himself

<EOS>
but
you
and
I
feel
sure
that
we
think
of
him
as
he
deserve

<EOS>
He
argue
with
Henry
that
the
dog
have
be
already
poison
when
he
change
so

spring
at
him

believe
it

<EOS>
the
last
word
be
speak
aloud

as
the
vigilant
Blandois
stop
,
turn
his
head
,
and
look
at
them
from
the
bottom
of
the
staircase

<EOS>
assuredly
he
do
look
then
,
though
he
look
his
politest
,
as
if
any
real
philanthropist
could
have
desire
no
well
employment
than
to
lash
a
great
stone
to
his
neck

drop
him
into
the
water
flow
beyond
the
dark
arched
gateway
in

he
stand

<EOS>
no
such
benefactor

spot

he
hand
Mrs

to
her
boat

stand
there
until
it

shoot
out

narrow
view

when
he
hand
himself
into
his
own
boat
and
follow

<EOS>
little
Dorrit
have
sometimes
think
,
and
now
think
again
as
she
retrace
her
step
up
the
staircase
,
that
he
have
make
his
way
too
easily
into
her
father
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
but
so
many
and
such
variety
of
people
do
the
same
,
through
Mr
Dorrit
's
participation
in
his
eld
daughter
's
society
mania
,
that
it
be
hardly
an
exceptional
case
.
<EOS>
a
perfect
fury
for
make
acquaintance
on
whom
to
impress
their
rich
and
importance
,
have
seize
the
House
of
Dorrit
.
   
<EOS>
It
appear
on
the
whole
,
to
Little
Dorrit
herself
,
that
this
same
society
in
which
they
live
,
greatly
resemble
a
superior
sort
of
Marshalsea
.
 
<EOS>
number
of
people
seem
to
come
abroad
,
pretty
much
as
people
have
come
into
the
prison
;
through
debt
,
through
idleness
,
relationship
,
curiosity
,
and
general
unfitness
for
get
on
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
bring
into
these
foreign
town
in
the
custody
of
courier
and
local
follower
,
just
as
the
debtor
have
be
bring
into
the
prison
.
 
<EOS>
They
prowl
about
the
church
and
picture
-
gallery
,
much
in
the
old
,
dreary
,
prison
-
yard
manner
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
usually
go
away
again
to
-
morrow
or
next
week
,
and
rarely
know
their
own
mind
,
and
seldom
do
what
they
say
they
would
do
,
or
go
where
they
say
they
would
go
:
in
all
this
again
,
very
like
the
prison
debtor
.
 
<EOS>
They
pay
high
for
poor
accommodation
,
and
disparage
a
place
while
they
pretend
to
like
it
:
which
be
exactly
the
Marshalsea
custom
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
envy
when
they
go
away
by
people
leave
behind
,
feign
not
to
want
to
go
:
and
that
again
be
the
Marshalsea
habit
invariably
.
 
<EOS>
a
certain
set
of
word
and
phrase
,
as
much
belong
to
tourist
as
the
College
and
the
snuggery
belong
to
the
jail
,
be
always
in
their
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
precisely
the
same
incapacity
for
settle
down
to
anything
,
as
the
prisoner
use
to
have
;
they
rather
deteriorate
one
another
,
as
the
prisoner
use
to
do
;
and
they
wear
untidy
dress
,
and
fall
into
a
slouch
way
of
life
:
still
,
always
like
the
people
in
the
Marshalsea
.
   
<EOS>
the
period
of
the
family
's
stay
at
Venice
come
,
in
its
course
,
to
an
end
,
and
they
move
,
with
their
retinue
,
to
Rome
.
 
<EOS>
through
a
repetition
of
the
former
italian
scene
,
grow
more
dirty
and
more
haggard
as
they
go
on
,
and
bring
them
at
length
to
where
the
very
air
be
disease
,
they
pass
to
their
destination
.
 
<EOS>
a
fine
residence
have
be
take
for
them
on
the
Corso
,
and
there
they
take
up
their
abode
,
in
a
city
where
everything
seem
to
be
try
to
stand
still
for
ever
on
the
ruin
of
something
else
---
except
the
water
,
which
,
follow
eternal
law
,
tumble
and
roll
from
its
glorious
multitude
of
fountain
.
   
<EOS>
here
it
seem
to
Little
Dorrit
that
a
change
come
over
the
Marshalsea
spirit
of
their
society
,
and
that
Prunes
and
Prism
get
the
upper
hand
.
 
<EOS>
everybody
be
walk
about
St
Peter
's
and
the
Vatican
on
somebody
else
's
cork
leg
,
and
strain
every
visible
object
through
somebody
else
's
sieve
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
say
what
anything
be
,
but
everybody
say
what
the
Mrs
Generals
,
Mr
Eustace
,
or
somebody
else
say
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
body
of
traveller
seem
to
be
a
collection
of
voluntary
human
sacrifice
,
bind
hand
and
foot
,
and
deliver
over
to
Mr
Eustace
and
his
attendant
,
to
have
the
entrail
of
their
intellect
arrange
accord
to
the
taste
of
that
sacred
priesthood
.
 
<EOS>
through
the
rugged
remain
of
temple
and
tomb
and
palace
and

hall
and

amphitheatre
of
ancient

<EOS>
Mrs

there

an
amazing

and
it

not

<EOS>
another
modification
of
Prunes
and
Prism
insinuate
itself
on
Little
Dorrit
's
notice
very
shortly
after
their
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
They
receive
an
early
visit
from
Mrs
Merdle
,
who
lead
that
extensive
department

in
the
Eternal

the
skilful

<EOS>
the

by

into
sound
trim

free
to
follow
his
own
ingenious
device
,
have
do
much
to
enhance
the
character
of
the
factory

<EOS>
as
an
ingenious
man
,
he
have
necessarily
to
encounter
every
discouragement
that
the
rule
power
for
a
length
of
time
have
be
able
by
any
mean
to
put
in
the
way
of
this
class
of
culprit
;
but
that
be
only
reasonable
self
-
defence
in
the
power
,
since
how
to
do
it
must
obviously
be
regard
as
the
natural
and
mortal
enemy
of
how
not
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
be
to
be
find
the
basis
of
the
wise
system
,
by
tooth
and
nail
uphold
by
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
of
warn
every
ingenious
british
subject
to
be
ingenious
at
his
peril
:
of
harass
him
,
obstruct
him
,
invite
robber
(
by
make
his
remedy
uncertain
,
and
expensive
)
to
plunder
him
,
and
at
the
good
of
confiscate
his
property
after
a
short
term
of
enjoyment
,
as
though
invention
be
on
a
par
with
felony
.
 
<EOS>
the
system
have
uniformly
find
great
favour
with
the
Barnacles
,
and
that
be
only
reasonable
,
too
;
for
one
who
worthily
invent
must
be
in
earnest
,
and
the
Barnacles
abhor
and
dread
nothing
half
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
that
again
be
very
reasonable
;
since
in
a
country
suffer
under
the
affliction
of
a
great
amount
of
earnestness
,
there
may
,
in

It

out

so
Clennam
think
,
when
he
sometimes
observe
him
of
an
evening
look
over
the
model

drawing

and
console
himself
by
mutter
with
a
sigh
as
he
put
them
away
again

that
the
thing
be
as
true
as
it
ever
be
.
   
<EOS>
to
show
no
sympathy
with
so
much
endeavour
,
and
so
much
disappointment
,
would
have
be
to
fail
in
what
Clennam
regard
as

He
ask
his

<EOS>
He
have
the

often

in

which

His

it

him

<EOS>
there
be
something
almost
ludicrous
in
the
complete
irreconcilability
of
a
vague
conventional
notion
that
he

man

with
the

sagacious
travelling

their

hardly

<EOS>
He
never
say
,
I
discover
this
adaptation
or
invent
that
combination
;
but
show
the
whole
thing
as
if
the
Divine
artificer
have
make
it
,
and
he
have
happen
to
find
it
;
so
modest
he
be
about
it
,
such
a
pleasant
touch
of
respect
be
mingle
with
his
quiet
admiration
of
it

and
so
calmly
convinced
he
be
that
it

irrefragable

<EOS>
not
only
that
evening
,
but
for
several

quite
charm

this
investigation

<EOS>
the
more
he
pursue
it
,
and
the
oftener
he
glance
at
the
grey
head
bend
over
it
,
and
the
shrewd
eye
kindle
with
pleasure
in
it
and
love
of
it

instrument
for
probe
his
heart
though
it
have

the

could
reconcile
it
to
his

energy
to
let

go
without

<EOS>
at
length
he
say
:

Doyce
look
alarmed

in

I

<EOS>
Daniel
Doyce
be
still
reluctant
to
consent
,
and
again
and
again
urge
that
they
have
better
put
it
by
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
natural
that
he
should
gradually
allow
himself
to
be
over
-
persuade
by
Clennam
,
and
should
yield
.
 
<EOS>
yield
he
do
.
 
<EOS>
so
Arthur
resume
the
long
and
hopeless
labour
of
strive
to
make
way
with
the
Circumlocution
Office
.
   
<EOS>
the
waiting
-
room
of
that
Department
soon
begin
to
be
familiar
with
his
presence
,
and
he
be
generally
usher
into
them
by
its
janitor
much
as
a
pickpocket
may
be
show
into
a
police
-
office
;
the
principal
difference
be
that
the
object
of
the
latter
class
of
public
business
be
to
keep
the
pickpocket
,
while
the
Circumlocution
object
be
to
get
rid
of
Clennam
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
be
resolve
to
stick
to
the
Great
Department
;
and
so
the
work
of
form
-
filling
,
corresponding
,
minuting
,
memorandum

make
,
signing
,
counter
-
sign

refer
backwards
and
forwards
,
and
refer
sideways
,
crosswise
,
and
zig

,
recommenced
.
   
<EOS>
here
arise
a
feature
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
not
previously
mention
in
the
present
record
.
 
<EOS>
when
that
admirable
Department
get
into
trouble
,
and
be
,
by
some
infuriate
member
of
Parliament
whom
the
small
barnacle
almost
suspect
of
labour
under
diabolic
possession
,
attack
on
the
merit
of
no
individual
case
,
but
as
an
Institution
wholly
abominable
and
Bedlamite
;
then
the
noble
or
right
honourable
Barnacle
who
represent
it
in
the
House
,
would
smite
that
member
and
cleave
him
asunder
,
with
a
statement
of
the
quantity
of
business
(
for
the
prevention
of
business
)
do
by
the
Circumlocution
Office
.
 
<EOS>
then
would
that
noble
or
right
honourable
Barnacle
hold
in
his
hand
a
paper
contain
a
few
figure
,
to
which
,
with
the
permission
of
the
House
,
he
would
entreat
its
attention
.
 
<EOS>
then
would
the
inferior
Barnacles
exclaim
,
obey
order
,
"
Hear
,
Hear
,
Hear
!
"
and
"
read
!
"
 
<EOS>
then
would
the
noble
or
right
honourable
Barnacle
perceive
,
sir
,
from
this
little
document
,
which
he
think
may
carry
conviction
even
to
the
perverse
mind
(
derisive
laughter
and
cheer
from
the
Barnacle
fry
)
,
that
within
the
short
compass
of
the
last
financial
half
-
year
,
this
much
-
malign
Department
(
Cheers
)
have
write
and
receive
fifteen
thousand
letter
(
loud
cheer
)
,
have
write
twenty
-
four
thousand
minute
(
loud
cheer
)
,
and
thirty
-
two
thousand
five
hundred
and
seventeen
memoranda
(
Vehement
cheer
)
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
an
ingenious
gentleman
connect
with
the
Department
,
and
himself
a
valuable
public
servant
,
have
do
him
the
favour
to
make
a
curious
calculation
of
the
amount
of
stationery
consume
in
it
during
the
same
period
.
 
<EOS>
It
form
a
part
of
this
same
short
document
;
and
he
derive
from
it
the
remarkable
fact
that
the
sheet
of
foolscap
paper
it
have
devote
to
the
public
service
would
pave
the
footway
on
both
side
of
Oxford
Street
from
end
to
end
,
and
leave
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
spare
for
the
park
(
immense
cheering
and
laughter
)
;
while
of
tape
---
red
tape
---
it
have
use
enough
to
stretch
,
in
graceful
festoon
,
from
Hyde
Park
Corner
to
the
General
Post
Office
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
amidst
a
burst
of
official
exultation
,
would
the
noble
or
right
honourable
Barnacle
sit
down
,
leave
the
mutilated
fragment
of
the
Member
on
the
field
.
 
<EOS>
no
one
,
after
that
exemplary
demolition
of
him
,
would
have
the
hardihood
to
hint
that
the
more
the
Circumlocution
Office
do
,
the
less
be
do
,
and
that
the
great
blessing
it
could
confer
on
an
unhappy
public
would
be
to
do
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
with
sufficient
occupation
on
his
hand
,
now
that
he
have
this
additional
task
---
such
a
task
have
many
and
many
a
serviceable
man
die
of
before
his
day
---
Arthur
Clennam
lead
a
life
of
slight
variety
.
 
<EOS>
regular
visit
to
his
mother
's
dull
sick
room
,
and
visit
scarcely
less
regular
to
Mr
Meagles
at
Twickenham
,
be
its
only
change
during
many
month
.
   
<EOS>
He
sadly
and
sorely
miss
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
prepare
to
miss
her
very
much
,
but
not
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
to
the
full
extent
only
through
experience
,
what
a
large
place
in
his
life
be
leave
blank
when
her
familiar
little
figure
go
out
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
,
too
,
that
he
must
relinquish
the
hope
of
its
return
,
understand
the
family
character
sufficiently
well
to
be
assure
that
he
and
she
be
divide
by
a
broad
ground
of
separation
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
interest
he
have
have
in
her
,
and
her
old
trust
reliance
on
him
,
be
tinge
with
melancholy
in
his
mind
:
so
soon
have
change
steal
over
them
,
and
so
soon
have
they
glide
into
the
past
with
other
secret
tenderness
.
   
<EOS>
when
he
receive
her
letter
he
be
greatly
move
,
but
do
not
the
less
sensibly
feel
that
she
be
far
divide
from
him
by
more
than
distance
.
 
<EOS>
It
help
him
to
a
clear
and
keen
perception
of
the
place
assign
him
by
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
that
he
be
cherish
in
her
grateful
remembrance
secretly
,
and
that
they
resent
him
with
the
jail
and
the
rest
of
its
belonging
.
   
<EOS>
through
all
these
meditation
which
every
day
of
his
life
crowd
about
her
,
he
think
of
her
otherwise
in
the
old
way
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
his
innocent
friend
,
his
delicate
child
,
his
dear
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
this
very
change
of
circumstance
fit
curiously
in
with
the
habit
,
begin
on
the
night
when
the
rose
float
away
,
of
consider
himself
as
a
much
old
man
than
his
year
really
make
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
regard
her
from
a
point
of
view
which
in
its
remoteness
,
tender
as
it
be
,
he
little
thought
would
have
be
unspeakable
agony
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
speculate
about
her
future
destiny
,
and
about
the
husband
she
may
have
,
with
an
affection
for
her
which
would
have
drain
her
heart
of
its
dear
drop
of
hope
,
and
break
it
.
   
<EOS>
everything
about
him
tend
to
confirm
him
in
the
custom
of
look
on
himself
as
an
elderly
man
,
from
whom
such
aspiration
as
he
have
combat
in
the
case
of
Minnie
Gowan
(
though
that
be
not
so
long
ago
either
,
reckon
by
month
and
season
)
,
be
finally
depart
.
 
<EOS>
His
relation
with
her
father
and
mother
be
like
those
on
which
a
widower
son
-
in
-
law
may
have
stand
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
twin
sister
who
be
dead
have
live
to
pass
away
in
the
bloom
of
womanhood
,
and
he
have
be
her
husband
,
the
nature
of
his
intercourse
with
Mr
and
Mrs
Meagles
would
probably
have
be
just
what
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
this
imperceptibly
help
to
render
habitual
the
impression
within
him
,
that
he
have
do
with
,
and
dismiss
that
part
of
life
.
   
<EOS>
He
invariably
hear
of
Minnie
from
them
,
as
tell
them
in
her
letter
how
happy
she
be
,
and
how
she
love
her
husband
;
but
inseparable
from
that
subject
,
he
invariably
see
the
old
cloud
on
Mr
Meagles
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
have
never
be
quite
so
radiant
since
the
marriage
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
never
quite
recover
the
separation
from
Pet
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
the
same
good
-
humoured
,
open
creature
;
but
as
if
his
face
,
from
be
much
turn
towards
the
picture
of
his
two
child
which
could
show
him
only
one
look
,
unconsciously
adopt
a
characteristic
from
them
,
it
always
have
now
,
through
all
its
change
of
expression
,
a
look
of
loss
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
one
wintry
Saturday
when
Clennam
be
at
the
cottage
,
the
Dowager
Mrs
Gowan
drive
up
,
in
the
Hampton

equipage
which
pretend
to
be
the
exclusive
equipage
of
so
many

<EOS>
She
descend
,
in
her
shady
ambuscade
of
green
fan
,
to
favour
Mr

Mrs
Meagles
with
a
call
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
how
do
you
both
do

Papa

Mama
Meagles

My
poor

and
this
mode
of
speak
of
him
politely
keep
alive

without
any
offence
in
the

the
pretence
that
he
have

the

<EOS>
which
also
delicately
imply
that
her
son
have
be
capture
by
mere
beauty
,
and
under
its
fascination
have
forgo
all
sort
of
worldly
advantage

<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
"
say
Mrs
Gowan
,
without
strain
her
attention
on
the
answer
she
receive

it
be
an
unspeakable
comfort
to
know
they
continue
happy

<EOS>
My
poor
fellow
be
of
such
a
restless
disposition

have
be
so
use

rove
about

to

inconstant

popular

I

Mr

fidgety
under
the
question

reply
,
"
I

him
on

then
adroitly

it
between

that
my

already
in

that
I
suppose
I

clear

<EOS>
It
may
be
as
well
,
even
on
this
account
,
that
I
should
step
over
there

look
him
up
in

friendly
way

then

here

Mother

of
health

that
she
should
not
be
leave
to
feel
lonesome
at
the
present
time

<EOS>
It
be
undeniably
a
long
way
off

Arthur

a
strange
place
for
the
poor
love
under
all
the
circumstance

<EOS>
let

be

well
care

I
require

shake

"
now
I

Cavallooro

I
stick
at
his
very
name
to
start
with

and
it
sound
like
the

comic

)
be
so
necessary
to
you
,
that
I
do
not
like
the
thought
of
take
him
away

<EOS>
More
than
that
,
there
be
no
saying
when
we
may
come
home
again
;

it
would
never

to
take
him
away

an
indefinite

<EOS>
the

not

it

It
only
hold
two
little

less

Pet

her
poor
unfortunate

it
seem
empty
now

<EOS>
once
out

there

no

Arthur

I

<EOS>
They
would
do
best
by
themselves
perhaps

after
all

Clennam
think

therefore
do
not

his
proposal

<EOS>
"
if
you

down

stay
here
for

change

when

Mr

,
"
I

They
agree

weather
be
of
high

it

become
easy
again

of
his

that
the

Mr

express
it
,
the

and
within
a
few
day
Father

Mrs

space
of
time
<EOS>
she
suppose
there
may
have
be
between
the
two
set
of
ocular
quivering
she
have
experience
?
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Tickit
,
though
minutely
circumstantial
in
her
reply
,
have
no
settle
opinion
between
five
second
and
ten
minute
.
   
<EOS>
She
be
so
plainly
at
sea
on
this
part
of
the
case
,
and
have
so
clearly
be
startle
out
of
slumber
,
that
Clennam
be
much
dispose
to
regard
the
appearance
as
a
dream
.
 
<EOS>
without
hurt
Mrs
Tickit
's
feeling
with
that
infidel
solution
of
her
mystery
,
he
take
it
away
from
the
cottage
with
him
;
and
probably
would
have
retain
it
ever
afterwards
if
a
circumstance
have
not
soon
happen
to
change
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
He
be
pass
at
nightfall
along
the
Strand
,
and
the
lamp
-
lighter
be
go
on
before
him
,
under
whose
hand
the
street
-
lamp
,
blur
by
the
foggy
air
,
burst
out
one
after
another
,
like
<EOS>
so
many
blaze
sunflower
come
into
full
-
blow
all
at
once
,
---
when
a
stoppage
on
the
pavement
,
cause
by
a
train
of
coal
-
waggon
toil
up
from
the
wharf
at
the
river
-
side
,
bring
him
to
a
stand
-
still
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
walk
quickly
,
and
go
with
some
current
of
thought
,
and
the
sudden
check
give
to
both
operation
cause
him
to
look
freshly
about
him
,
as
people
under
such
circumstance
usually
do
.
   
<EOS>
immediately
,
he
see
in
advance
---
a
few
people
intervene
,
but
still
so
near
to
him
that
he
could
have
touch
them
by
stretch
out
his
arm
---
Tattycoram
and
a
strange
man
of
a
remarkable
appearance
:
a
swaggering
man
,
with
a
high
nose
,
and
a
black
moustache
as
false
in
its
colour
as
his
eye
be
false
in
their
expression
,
who
wear
his
heavy
cloak
with
the
air
of
a
foreigner
.
 
<EOS>
His
dress
and
general
appearance
be
those
of
a
man
on
travel
,
and
he
seem
to
have
very
recently
join
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
in
bend
down
(
be
much
tall
than
she
be
)
,
listen
to
whatever
she
say
to
him
,
he
look
over
his
shoulder
with
the
suspicious
glance
of
one
who
be
not
unused
to
be
mistrustful
that
his
footstep
may
be
dog
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
then
that
Clennam
see
his
face
;
as
his
eye
lower
on
the
people
behind
him
in
the
aggregate
,
without
particularly
rest
upon
Clennam
's
face
or
any
other
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
scarcely
turn
his
head
about
again
,
and
it
be
still
bent
down
,
listen
to
the
girl
,
when
the
stoppage
cease
,
and
the
obstruct
stream
of
people
flow
on
.
 
<EOS>
still
bend
his
head
and
listen
to
the
girl
,
he
go
on
at
her
side
,
and
Clennam
follow
them
,
resolve
to
play
this
unexpected
play
out
,
and
see
where
they
go
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
hardly
make
the
determination
(
though
he
be
not
long
about
it
)
,
when
he
be
again
as
suddenly
bring
up
as
he
have
be
by
the
stoppage
.
 
<EOS>
They
turn
short
into
the
Adelphi
,
---
the
girl
evidently
lead
,
---
and
go
straight
on
,
as
if
they
be
go
to
the
Terrace
which
overhang
the
river
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
always
,
to
this
day
,
a
sudden
pause
in
that
place
to
the
roar
of
the
great
thoroughfare
.
 
<EOS>
the
many
sound
become
so
deadened
that
the
change
be
like
put
cotton
in
the
ear
,
or
have
the
head
thickly
muffle
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
time
the
contrast
be
far
great
;
there
be
no
small
steam
-
boat
on
the
river
,
no
landing
place
but
slippery
wooden
stair
and
foot
-
causeway
,
no
railroad
on
the
opposite
bank
,
no
hang
bridge
or
fish
-
market
near
at
hand
,
no
traffic
on
the
near
bridge
of
stone
,
nothing
move
on
the
stream
<EOS>
but
waterman
's
wherry
and
coal
-
lighter
.
 
<EOS>
long
and
broad
black
tier
of
the
latter
,
moor
fast
in
the
mud
as
if
they
be
never
to
move
again
,
make
the
shore
funereal
and
silent
after
dark
;
and
keep
what
little
water
-
movement
there
be
,
far
out
towards
mid
-
stream
.
 
<EOS>
at
any
hour
later
than
sunset
,
and
not
least
at
that
hour
when
most
of
the
people
who
have
anything
to
eat
at
home
be
go
home
to
eat
it
,
and
when
most
of
those
who
have
nothing
have
hardly
yet
slink
out
to
beg
or
steal
,
it
be
a
deserted
place
and
look
on
a
deserted
scene
.
   
<EOS>
such
be
the
hour
when
Clennam
stop
at
the
corner
,
observe
the
girl
and
the
strange
man
as
they
go
down
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
's
footstep
be
so
noisy
on
the
echo
stone
that
he
be
unwilling
to
add
the
sound
of
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
they
have
pass
the
turning
and
be
in
the
darkness
of
the
dark
corner
lead
to
the
terrace
,
he
make
after
them
with
such
indifferent
appearance
of
be
a
casual
passenger
on
his
way
,
as
he
could
assume
.
   
<EOS>
when
he
round
the
dark
corner
,
they
be
walk
along
the
terrace
towards
a
figure
which
be
come
towards
them
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
see
it
by
itself
,
under
such
condition
of
gas
-
lamp
,
mist
,
and
distance
,
he
may
not
have
know
it
at
first
sight
,
but
with
the
figure
of
the
girl
to
prompt
him
,
he
at
once
recognise
Miss
Wade
.
   
<EOS>
He
stop
at
the
corner
,
seem
to
look
back
expectantly
up
the
street
as
if
he
have
make
an
appointment
with
some
one
to
meet
him
there
;
but
he
keep
a
careful
eye
on
the
three
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
come
together
,
the
man
take
off
his
hat
,
and
make
Miss
Wade
a
bow
.
 
<EOS>
the
girl
appear
to
say
a
few
word
as
though
she
present
him
,
or
account
for
his
be
late
,
or
early
,
or
what
not
;
and
then
fall
a
pace
or
so
behind
,
by
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Wade
and
the
man
then
begin
to
walk
up
and
down
;
the
man
have
the
appearance
of
be
extremely
courteous
and
complimentary
in
manner
;
Miss
Wade
have
the
appearance
of
be
extremely
haughty
.
   
<EOS>
when
they
come
down
to
the
corner
and
turn
,
she
be
say
,
   
"
if
I
pinch
myself
for
it
,
sir
,
that
be
my
business

<EOS>
confine
yourself
to
yours

ask
me
no

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
by
Heaven
,
madam
!
"
<EOS>
he
reply
,
make
her
another
bow
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
profound
respect
for
the
strength
of
your
character
,
and
my
admiration
of
your
beauty
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
from
any
one
,
"
say
she
,
"
and
certainly
not
from
you
of
all
creature
.
 
<EOS>
go
on
with
your
report
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
be
I
pardon
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
with
an
air
of
half
abash
gallantry
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
pay
,
"
she
say
,
"
and
that
be
all
you
want
.
"
   
<EOS>
whether
the
girl
hang
behind
because
she
be
not
to
hear
the
business
,
or
as
already
know
enough
about
it
,
Clennam
could
not
determine
.
 
<EOS>
They
turn
and
she
turn
.
 
<EOS>
She
look
away
at
the
river
,
as
she
walk
with
her
hand
fold
before
her
;
and
that
be
all
he
could
make
of
her
without
show
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
there
happen
,
by
good
fortune
,
to
be
a
lounger
really
wait
for
some
one
;
and
he
sometimes
look
over
the
railing
at
the
water
,
and
sometimes
come
to
the
dark
corner
and
look
up
the
street
,
render
Arthur
less
conspicuous
.
   
<EOS>
when
Miss
Wade
and
the
man
come
back
again
,
she
be
say
,
"
You
must
wait
until
to
-
morrow
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
a
thousand
pardon
?
<EOS>
"
he
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
faith
!
 
<EOS>
then
it
be
not
convenient
to

night
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no

<EOS>
I
tell
you
I
must
get
it
before
I
can
give
it
to
you

"
   
<EOS>
She
stop
in
the
roadway
,
as
if
to
put
an
end
to
the
conference
.
<EOS>
He
of
course
stop
too
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
girl
stop
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
little
inconvenient
,
"
say
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
little

<EOS>
but
,
Holy

that

<EOS>
I
be
without
money
to

night
,
by
chance

<EOS>
I
have
a
good
banker
in
this
city
,
but
I
would
not
wish
to
draw
upon
the
house
until
the
time
when
I
shall
draw

"
   
<EOS>
"
Harriet

"
say
Miss

"
arrange
with
him
---
this
gentleman
here
---
for
send
him
some
money
to

morrow
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
say
it
with
a
slur
of
the
word
gentleman
which
be
more
contemptuous
than
any
emphasis
,
and
walk
slowly
on
.
<EOS>
the
man
bend
his
head
again
,
and
the
girl
speak
to
him
as
they
both
follow
her
.
 
<EOS>
Clennam
venture
to
look
at
the
girl
as
they
move
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
note
that
her
rich
black
eye
be
fasten
upon
the
man
with
a
scrutinise
expression
,
and
that
she
keep
at
a
little
distance
from
him
,
as
they
walk
side
by
side
to
the
further
end
of
the
terrace
.
   
<EOS>
a
loud
and
alter
clank
upon
the
pavement
warn
him
,
before
he
could
discern
what
be
pass
there
,
that
the
man
be
come
back
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Clennam
lounge
into
the
road
,
towards
the
railing
;
and
the
man
pass
at
a
quick
swing
,
with
the
end
of
his
cloak
throw
over
his
shoulder
,
singe
a
scrap
of
a
french
song
.
   
<EOS>
the
whole
vista
have
no
one
in
it
now
but
himself
.
 
<EOS>
the
lounger
have
lounge
out
of
view
,
and
Miss
Wade
and
Tattycoram
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
More
than
ever
bent
on
see
what
become
of
them
,
and
on
have
some
information
to
give
his
good
friend
,
Mr
Meagles
,
he
go
out
at
the
further
end
of
the
terrace
,
look
cautiously
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
rightly
judge
that
,
at
first
at
all
event
,
they
would
go
in
a
contrary
direction
from
their
late
companion
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
see
them
in
a
neighbouring
bye
-
street
,
which
be
not
a
thoroughfare
,
evidently
allow
time
for
the
man
to
get
well
out
of
their
way
.
 
<EOS>
They
walk
leisurely
arm
-
in
-
arm
down
one
side
of
the
street
,
and
return
on
the
opposite
side
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
come
back
to
the
street
-
corner
,
they
change
their
pace
for
the
pace
of
people
with
an
object
and
a
distance
before
them
,
and
walk
steadily
away
.
<EOS>
clennam
,
no
less
steadily
,
keep
them
in
sight
.
   
<EOS>
They
cross
the
Strand
,
and
pass
through
Covent
Garden
(
under
the
window
of
his
old
lodging
where
dear
Little
Dorrit
have
come
that
night
)
,
and
slant
away
north
-
east
,
until
they
pass
the
great
building
whence
Tattycoram
derive
her
name
,
and
turn
into
the
Gray
's
Inn
Road
.
 
<EOS>
Clennam
be
quite
at
home
here
,
in
right
of
Flora
,
not
to
mention
the
Patriarch
and
Pancks
,
and
keep
them
in
view
with
ease
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
begin
to
wonder
where
they
may
be
go
next
,
when
that
wonder
be
lose
in
the
great
wonder
with
which
he
see
them
turn
into
the
Patriarchal
street
.
 
<EOS>
that
wonder
be
in
its
turn
swallow
up
on
the
great
wonder
with
which
he
see
them
stop
at
the
patriarchal
door
.
 
<EOS>
a
low
double
knock
at
the
bright
brass
knocker
,
a
gleam
of
light
into
the
road
from
the
open
door
,
a
brief
pause
for
inquiry
and
answer
and
the
door
be
shut
,
and
they
be
house
.
   
<EOS>
after
look
at
the
surround
object
for
assurance
that
he
be
not
in
an
odd
dream
,
and
after
pace
a
little
while
before
the
house
,
Arthur
knock
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
open
by
the
usual
maid
-
servant
,
and
she
show
him
up
at
once
,
with
her
usual
alacrity
,
to
Flora
's
sitting
-
room
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
no

with
Flora
but
Mr

Aunt

which
respectable
gentlewoman
,
bask
in
a
balmy
atmosphere
of
tea
and
toast
,
be
ensconce
in
an
easy

chair
by
the
fireside
,
with
a
little
table
at
her
elbow
,
and
a
clean
white
handkerchief
spread
over
her
lap
on
which
two
piece
of
toast
at
that
moment
await
consumption
.
<EOS>
bend
over
a
steam
vessel
of
tea
,
and
look
through
the
steam
,
and
breathe
forth
the
steam
,
like
a
malignant
chinese
enchantress
engage
in
the
performance
of
unholy
rite

Mr
F

Aunt
put
down
her
great
teacup
and
exclaim
,
"
Drat
him

if

<EOS>
It
would
seem
from
the
foregoing
exclamation
that
this
uncompromising
relative
of
the
lament
Mr

measure
time
by
the
acuteness

not

never

him
of
his
labour
have
be
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
have
take
any
time
to
think
about
it
,
for
Mr
Casby
,
well
accustomed
to
get
on
anywhere
by
leave
everything
to
his
bump
and
his
white
hair
,
know
his
strength
to
lie
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
so
there
Casby
sit
,
twirl
and
twirl
,
and
make
his
polished
head
and
forehead
look
largely
benevolent
in
every
knob
.
   
<EOS>
with
this
spectacle
before
him
,
Arthur
have
rise
to
go
,
when
from
the
inner
Dock
where
the
good
ship
Pancks
be
hove
down
when
out
in
no
cruising
ground
,
the
noise
be
hear
of
that
steamer
labour
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
strike
Arthur
that
the
noise
begin
demonstratively
far
off
,
as
though
Mr
Pancks
seek
to
impress
on
any
one
who
may
happen
to
think
about
it
,
that
he
be
work
on
from
out
of
hearing
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
and
he
shake
hand
,
and
the
former
bring
his
employer
a
letter
or
two
to
sign
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
in
shake
hand
merely
scratch
his
eyebrow
with
his
left
forefinger
and
snort
once
,
but
Clennam
,
who
understand
him
better
now
than
of
old
,
comprehend
that
he
have
almost
do
for
the
evening
and
wish
to
say
a
word
to
him
outside
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
when
he
have
take
his
leave
of
Mr
Casby
,
and
(
which
be
a
more
difficult
process
)
of
Flora
,
he
saunter
in
the
neighbourhood
on
Mr
Pancks
's
line
of
road
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
wait
but
<EOS>
a
short
time
when
Mr
Pancks
appear
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Pancks
shake
hand
again
with
another
expressive
snort
,
and
take
off
his
hat
to
put
his
hair
up
,
Arthur
think
he
receive
his
cue
to
speak
to
him
as
one
who
know
pretty
well
what
have
just
now
pass
.
<EOS>
therefore
he
say
,
without
any
preface
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
they
be
really
go
,
panck
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes

reply
panck

<EOS>
"
They

<EOS>

do
he
know
where
to
find
that

<EOS>

<EOS>
I
should
think
so

"
   
<EOS>
Mr

do
not

<EOS>
no
,
Mr

do
not

<EOS>
do
Mr
Pancks
know
anything
about
her
?
<EOS>
"
I
expect
,
"
rejoin
that
worthy
,
"
I
know
as
much
about
her
as
she
know
about
herself
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
somebody
's
child
---
<EOS>
anybody
's
---
nobody
be

<EOS>
put
her
in
a
room
in
London
here
with
any
six
people
old
enough
to
be
her
parent
,
and
her
parent
may
be
there
for
anything
she
know
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
be
in
any
house
she
see
,
they
may
be
in
any
churchyard
she
pass
,
she
may
run
against
'em
in
any
street
,
she
may
make
chance
acquaintance
of
'em
at
any
time
;
and
never
know
it

<EOS>
She
know
nothing
about
'em

<EOS>
She
know
nothing
about
any

whatever
.
 
<EOS>
never

<EOS>
never

"
<EOS>
"
Mr

could
enlighten
her
,
perhaps
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
May
be
,
"
say
panck
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
expect
so
,
but
do
not
know

<EOS>
He
have
long
have
money
(
not
overmuch
as
I
make
out
)
in
trust
to
dole
out
to
her
when
she
can
not
do
without
it
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
she
be
proud
and
will
not
touch
it
for
a
length
of
time
;
sometimes
she
be
so
poor
that
she
must
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
writhe
under
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
a

more
angry

revengeful
never
live

She
come
for
money

<EOS>
say
she
have
peculiar
occasion
for
it

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
observe
Clennam
musing
,
"
<EOS>
I
by
chance
know
what
occasion

I
mean
into
whose
pocket
the

be
to

"
   
<EOS>
"
indeed
?
"
say
panck
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
a
compact
,
I
recommend
that
party
to
be
exact
in
it

<EOS>
I
would
not
trust
myself
to
that
woman
,
young

handsome

I
have
wrong
her

no

not

I

<EOS>
Arthur

hurriedly
review
his
own
observation
of
her

find
it
to
tally
pretty
nearly
with
Mr

the
wonder

Arthur
start

do
not

I

have
exhibit
himself
in
the
new

of

this
tremendous

Chapter
10
.
<EOS>
the
Dreams
of
Mrs
Flintwinch
thicken
 
the
shady
wait
-
room
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
where
he
pass
a
good
deal
of
time
in
company
with
various
troublesome
convict
who
be
under
sentence
to
be
break
alive
on
that
wheel
,
have
afford
Arthur
Clennam
ample
leisure
,
in
three
or
four
successive
day
,
to
exhaust
the
subject
of
his
late
glimpse
of
Miss
Wade
and
Tattycoram
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
able
to
make
no
more
of
it
and
no
less
of
it
,
and
in
this
unsatisfactory
condition
he
be
fain
to
leave
it
.
   
<EOS>
during
this
space
he
have
not
be
to
his
mother
's
dismal
old
house
.
   
<EOS>
one
of
his
customary
evening
for
repair
thither
now
come
round
<EOS>
,
he
leave
his
dwelling
and
his
partner
at
nearly
nine
o'clock
,
and
slowly
walk
in
the
direction
of
that
grim
home
of
his
youth
.
   
<EOS>
It
always
affect
his
imagination
as
wrathful
,
mysterious
,
and
sad
;
and
his
imagination
be
sufficiently
impressible
to
see
the
whole
neighbourhood
under
some
tinge
of
its
dark
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
go
along
,
upon
a
dreary
night
,
the
dim
street
by
which
he
go
,
seem
all
depository
of
oppressive
secret
.
 
<EOS>
the
desert
counting
-
house
,
with
their
secret
of
book
and
paper
lock
up
in
chest
and
safe
;
the
banking
-
house
,
with
their
secret
of
strong
room
and
well
,
the
key
of
which
be
in
a
very
few
secret
pocket
and
a
very
few
secret
breast
;
the
secret
of
all
the
disperse
grinder
in
the
vast
mill
,
among
whom
there
be
doubtless
plunderer
,
forger
,
and
trust
-
betrayer
of
many
sort
,
whom
the
light
of
any
day
that
dawn
may
reveal
;
he
could
have
fancy
that
these
thing
,
in
hiding
,
impart
a
heaviness
to
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
the
shadow
thickening
and
thickening
as
he
approach
its
source
<EOS>
,
he
think
of
the
secret
of
the
lonely
church
-
vault
,
where
the
people
who
have
hoard
and
secrete
in
iron
coffer
be
in
their
turn
similarly
hoard
,
not
yet
at
rest
from
do
harm
;
and
then
of
the
secret
of
the
river
,
as
it
roll
its
turbid
tide
between
two
frown
wilderness
of
secret
,
extend
,
thick
and
dense
,
for
many
mile
,
and
ward
off
the
free
air
and
the
free
country
sweep
by
wind
and
wing
of
bird
.
   
<EOS>
the
shadow
still
darken
as
he
draw
near
the
house
,
the
melancholy
room
which
his
father
have
once
occupy
,
haunt
by
the
appealing
face
<EOS>
he
have
himself
see
fade
away
with
him
when
there
be
no
other
watcher
by
the
bed
,
arise
before
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Its
close
air
be
secret
.
 
<EOS>
the
gloom
,
and
must
,
and
dust
of
the
whole
tenement
,
be
secret
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
heart
of
it
his
mother
preside
,
inflexible
of
face
,
indomitable
of
will
,
firmly
hold
all
the
secret
of
her
own
and
his
father
's
life
,
and
austerely
oppose
herself
,
front
to
front
,
to
the
great
final
secret
of
all
life
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
turn
into
the
narrow
and
steep
street
from
which
the
court
of
enclosure
wherein
the
house
stand
open
,
when
another
footstep
turn
into
it
behind
him
,
and
so
close
upon
his
own
that
he
be
jostle
to
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
as
his
mind
be
teem
with
these
thought
,
the
encounter
take
him
altogether
unprepared
,
so
that
the
other
passenger
have
have
time
to
say
,
boisterously
,
"
Pardon
!
 
<EOS>
not
my
fault
!
"
<EOS>
and
to
pass
on
before
the
instant
have
elapse
which
be
requisite
to
his
recovery
of
the
reality
about
him
.
   
<EOS>
when
that
moment
have
flash
away
,
he
see
that
the
man
stride
on
before
him
be
the
man
who
have
be
so
much
in
his
mind
during
the
last
few
day
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
casual
resemblance
,
help
out
by
the
force
of
the
impression
the
man
make
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
man
;
the
man
he
have
follow
in
company
with
the
girl
,
and
whom
he
have
overhear
talk
to
Miss
Wade
.
   
<EOS>
the
street
be
a
sharp
descent
and
be
crooked
too
,
and
the
man
(
who
although
not
drunk
have
the
air
of
be
flush
with
some
strong
drink
)
go
down
it
so
fast
that
Clennam
lose
him
as
he
look
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
with
no
define
intention
of
follow
him
,
but
with
an
impulse
to
keep
the
figure
in
view
a
little
long
,
Clennam
quicken
his
pace
to
pass
the
twist
in
the
street
which
hide
him
from
his
sight
.
 
<EOS>
on
turn
it
,
he
see
the
man
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
stand
now
,
close
to
the
gateway
of
his
mother
's
house
,
he
look
down
the
street
:
but
it
be
empty
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
projecting
shadow
large
enough
to
obscure
the
man
;
there
be
no
turning
near
that
he
could
have
take
;
nor
have
there
be
any
audible
sound
of
the
opening
and
closing
of
a
door
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
conclude
that
the
man
must
have
have
a
key
in
his
hand
,
and
must
have
open
one
of
the
many
house
-
door
and
go
in
.
   
<EOS>
ruminate
on
this
strange
chance
and
strange
glimpse
,
he
turn
into
the
court
-
yard
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
look
,
by
mere
habit
,
towards
the
feebly
light
window
of
his
mother
's
room
,
his
eye
encounter
the
figure
he
have
just
lose
,
stand
against
the
iron
railing
of
the
little
waste
enclosure
look
up
at
those
window
and
laugh
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
the
many
vagrant
cat
who
be
always
prowl
about
there
by
night
,
and
who
have
take
fright
at
him
,
appear
to
have
stop
when
he
have
stop
,
and
be
look
at
him
with
eye
by
no
mean
unlike
his
own
from
top
of
wall
and
porch
,
and
other
safe
point
of
pause
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
only
halt
for
a
moment
to
entertain
himself
thus
;
he
immediately
go
forward
,
throw
the
end
of
his
cloak
off
his
shoulder
as
he
go
,
ascend
the
unevenly
sink
step
,
and
knock
a
sounding
knock
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
Clennam
's
surprise
be
not
so
absorb
but
that
he
take
his
resolution
without
any
incertitude
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
up
to
the
door
too
,
and
ascend
the
step
too
.
 
<EOS>
His
friend
look
at
him
with
a
braggart
air
,
and
sing
to
himself
.

<EOS>
a

Her

under

the

dumb

Mr

who
have
spin
backward
some
two

three
yard

bring
himself
up

completely
unchanged

affect
by
shortness
of
breath

look
hard
at
Arthur

<EOS>
not
a
whit
less
reticent
and
wooden
be
Mr
Flintwinch
outwardly
,
than
in
the
usual
course
of
thing
:
<EOS>
the
only
perceptible
difference
in
him
be
that
the
knot
of
cravat
which
be
generally
under
his
ear
,
have
work
round
to
the
back
of
his
head
:
where
it
form
an
ornamental
appendage
not
unlike
a
bagwig
,
and
give
him
something
of
a
courtly
appearance
.
<EOS>
as
Mrs
Clennam
never
remove
her
eye
from
Blandois
(
on
whom
they
have
some
effect
,
as
a
steady
look
have

low
sort
of
dog

so
Jeremiah
never
remove
his
from
Arthur

<EOS>
It
be
as
if
they

tacitly
agree

take
their
different

thus
,
in
the
ensue
silence
,
Jeremiah
stand
scrape
his
chin

look
at
Arthur

be
try
to
screw
his
thought
out
of

after

little
,
the

irksome

impatiently
put
himself
with

to
the
sacred

burn

Thereupon

move
one

move

very
slightly

an
action

dismissal

it
(
perhaps
you
may
not
find
leisure
for
even
that
,
though
I
hope
you
will
some
day
)
,
I
be
now
go
to
devote
an
hour
to
write
to
you
again
.
 
<EOS>
this
time
,
I
write
from
Rome
.
   
<EOS>
We
leave
Venice
before
Mr
and
Mrs
Gowan
do
,
but
they
be
not
so
long
upon
the
road
as
we
be
,
and
do
not
travel
by
the
same
way
,
and
so
when
we
arrive
we
find
them
in
a
lodging
here
,
in
a
place
call
the
Via
Gregoriana
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
know
it
.
   
<EOS>
now
I
be
go
to
tell
you
all
I
can
about
them
,
because
I
know
that
be
what
you
most
want
to
hear
.
 
<EOS>
Theirs
be
not
a
very
comfortable
lodging
,
but
perhaps
I
think
it
less
so
when
I
first
see
it
than
you
would
have
do
,
because
you
have
be
in
many
different
country
and
have
see
many
different
custom
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
it
be
a
far
,
far
well
place
---
million
of
time
---
than
any
I
have
ever
be
use
to
until
lately
;
and
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
do
not
look
at
it
with
my
own
eye
,
but
with
hers
.
 
<EOS>
for
it
would
be
easy
to
see
that
she
have
always
be
bring
up
in
a
tender
and
happy
home
,
even
if
she
have
not
tell
me
so
with
great
love
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
well
,
it
be
a
rather
bare
lodging
up
a
rather
dark
common
staircase
,
and
it
be
nearly
all
a
large
dull
room
,
where
Mr
Gowan
paint
.
 
<EOS>
the
window
be
block
up
where
any
one
could
look
out
,
and
the
wall
have
be
all
draw
over
with
chalk
and
charcoal
by
other
who
have
live
there
before
---
<EOS>
oh
,
---
I
should
think
,
for
year
!
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
curtain
more
dust
-
colour
than
red
,
which
divide
it
,
and
the
part
behind
the
curtain
make
the
private
sitting
-
room
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
first
see
her
there
she
be
alone
,
and
her
work
have
fall
out
of
her
hand
,
and
she
be
look
up
at
the
sky
shine
through
the
top
of
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
do
not
be
uneasy
when
I
tell
you
,
but
it
be
not
quite
so
airy
,
nor
so
bright
,
nor
so
cheerful
,
nor
so
happy
and
youthful
altogether
as
I
should
have
like
it
to
be
.
   
<EOS>
on
account
of
Mr
Gowan
's
painting
Papa
's
picture
(
which
I
be
not
quite
convinced
I
should
have
know
from
the
likeness
if
I
have
not
see
him
do
it
)
,
I
have
have
more
opportunity
of
be
with
her
since
then
than
I
may
have
have
without
this
fortunate
chance
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
much
alone
.
 
<EOS>
very
much
alone
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
you
about
the
second
time
I
see
her
?
 
<EOS>
I
go
one
day
,
when
it
happen
that
I
could
run
round
by
myself
,
at
four
or
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
then
dine
alone
,
and
her
solitary
dinner
have
be
bring
in
from
somewhere
,
over
a
kind
of
brazier
with
a
fire
in
it
,
and
she
have
no
company
or
prospect
of
company
,
that
I
could
see
,
but
the
old
man
who
have
bring
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
tell
her
a
long
story
(
of
robber
outside
the
wall
be
take
up
by
a
stone
statue
of
a
Saint
)
,
to
entertain
her
---
as
he
say
to
me
when
I
come
out
,
"
because
he
have
a
daughter
of
his
own
,
though
she
be
not
so
pretty
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
ought
now
to
mention
Mr
Gowan
,
before
I
say
what
little
more
I
have
to
say
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
admire
her
beauty
,
and
he
must
be
proud
of
her
,
for
everybody
praise
it
,
and
he
must
be
fond
of
her
,
and
I
do
not
doubt
that
he
be
---
but
in
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
his
way
,
and
if
it
appear
as
careless
and
discontent
in
your
eye
as
it
do
in
mine
,
I
be
not
wrong
in
think
that
it
may
be
better
suited
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
do
not
seem
so
to
you
,
I
be
quite
sure
I
be
wholly
mistaken
;
for
your
unchanged
poor
child
confide
in
your
knowledge
and
goodness
more
than
she
could
ever
tell
you
if
she
be
to
try
.
 
<EOS>
but
do
not
be
frightened
,
I
be
not
go
to
try
.
<EOS>
owe
(
as
I
think
,
if
you
think
so
too
)
to
Mr
Gowan
's
unsettled
and
dissatisfied
way
,
he
apply
himself
to
his
profession
very
little
.
   
<EOS>
He
do
nothing
steadily
or
patiently
;
but
equally
take
thing
up
and
throw
them
down
,
and
do
them
,
or
leave
them
undone
,
without
care
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
hear
him
talk
to
Papa
during
the
sitting
for
the
picture
,
I
have
sit
wonder
whether
it
could
be
that
he
have
no
belief
in
anybody
else
,
because
he
have
no
belief
in
himself
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
so
?
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
you
will
say
when
you
come
to
this
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
how
you
will
look
,
and
I
can
almost
hear
the
voice
in
which
you
would
tell
me
on
the
Iron
Bridge
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gowan
go
out
a
good
deal
among
what
be
consider
the
good
company
here
---
though
he
do
not
look
as
if
he
enjoy
it
or
like
it
when
he
be
with
it
---
and
she
sometimes
accompany
him
,
but
lately
she
have
go
out
very
little
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
notice
that
they
have
an
inconsistent
way
of
speak
about
her
,
as
if
she
have
make
some
great
self
-
interested
success
in
marry
Mr
Gowan
,
though
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
very
same
people
,
would
not
have
dream
of
take
him
for
themselves
or
their
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
go
into
the
country
besides
,
to
think
about
make
sketch
;
and
in
all
place
where
there
be
visitor
,
he
have
a
large
acquaintance
and
be
very
well
know
.
 
<EOS>
besides
all
this
,
he
have
a
friend
who
be
much
in
his
society
both
at
home
and
away
from
home
,
though
he
treat
this
friend
very
coolly
and
be
very
uncertain
in
his
behaviour
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
quite
sure
(
because
she
have
tell
me
so
)
,
that
she
do
not
like
this
friend
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
so
revolt
to
me
,
too
,
that
his
be
away
from
here
,
at
present
,
be
quite
a
relief
to
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
how
much
more
to
hers
!
   
<EOS>
but
what
I
particularly
want
you
to
know
,
and
why
I
have
resolve
to
tell
you
so
much
while
I
be
afraid
it
may
make
you
a
little
uncomfortable
without
occasion
,
be
this
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
so
true
and
so
devoted
,
and
know
so
completely
that
all
her
love
and
duty
be
his
for
ever
,
that
you
may
be
certain
she
will
love
him
,
<EOS>
admire
him
,
praise
him
,
and
conceal
all
his
fault
,
until
she
die
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
she
conceal
them
,
and
always
will
conceal
them
,
even
from
herself
.
   
<EOS>
She
have
give
him
a
heart
that
can
never
be
take
back
;
and
however
much
he
may
try
it
<EOS>
,
he
will
never
wear
out
its
affection
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
the
truth
of
this
,
as
you
know
everything
,
far
far
better
than
I
;
but
I
can
not
help
tell
you
what
a
nature
she
show
,
and
that
you
can
never
think
too
well
of
her
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
call
her
by
her
name
in
this
letter
,
but
we
be
such
friend
now
that
I
do
so
when
we
be
quietly
together
,
and
she
speak
to
me
by
my
name
---
<EOS>
I
mean
,
not
my
christian
name
,
but
the
name
you
give
me
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
begin
to
call
me
Amy
,
I
tell
her
my
short
story
,
and
that
you
have
always
call
me
Little
Dorrit
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
that
the
name
be
much
dearer
to
me
than
any
other
,
and
so
she
call
me
little
Dorrit
too
.
   
<EOS>
perhaps
you
have
not
hear
from
her
father
or
mother
yet
,
and
may
not
know
that
she
have
a
baby
son
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
bear
only
two
day
ago
,
and
just
a
week
after
they
come
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
make
them
very
happy
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
must
tell
you
,
as
I
be
to
tell
you
all
,
that
I
fancy
they
be
under
a
constraint
with
Mr
Gowan
,
and
that
they
feel
as
if
his
mock
way
with
them
be
sometimes
a
slight
give
to
their
love
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
<EOS>
but
yesterday
,
when
I
be
there
,
that
I
see
Mr
Meagles
change
colour
,
and
get
up
and
go
out
,
as
if
he
be
afraid
that
he
may
say
so
,
unless
he
prevent
himself
by
that
mean
.
 
<EOS>
yet
I
be
sure
they
be
both
so
considerate
,
good
-
humoured
,
and
reasonable
,
that
he
may
spare
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
hard
in
him
not
to
think
of
them
a
little
more
.
   
<EOS>
I
stop
at
the
last
full
stop
to
read
all
this
over
.
 
<EOS>
It
look
at
first
as
if
I
be
take
on
myself
to
understand
and
explain
so
much
,
that
I
be
half
inclined
not
to
send
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
I
think
it
over
a
little
,
I
feel
more
hopeful
for
your
knowing
at
once
that
I
have
only
be
watchful
for
you
,
and
have
only
notice
what
I
think
I
have
notice
,
because
I
be
quicken
by
your
interest
in
it
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
you
may
be
sure
that
be
the
truth
.
   
<EOS>
and
now
I
have
do
with
the
subject
in
the
present
letter
,
and
have
little
leave
to
say
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
all
quite
well
,
and
Fanny
improve
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
hardly
think
how
kind
she
be
to
me
,
and
what
pain
she
take
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
a
lover
,
who
have
follow
her
,
first
all
the
way
from
Switzerland
,
and
then
all
the
way
from
Venice
,
and
who
have
just
confide
to
me
that
he
mean
to
follow
her
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
much
confuse
by
his
speak
to
me
about
it
,
but
he
would
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
to
say
,
but
at
last
I
tell
him
that
I
think
he
have
well
not
.
 
<EOS>
for
Fanny
<EOS>
(
but
I
do
not
tell
him
this
)
be
much
too
spirited
and
clever
to
suit
him
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
he
say
he
would
,
all
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
lover
,
of
course
.
   
<EOS>
if
you
should
ever
get
so
far
as
this
in
this
long
letter
,
you
will
perhaps
say
,
surely
little
Dorrit
will
not
leave
off
without
tell
me
something
about
her
travel
,
and
surely
it
be
time
she
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
indeed
,
but
I
do
not
know
what
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
since
we
leave
Venice
we
have
be
in
a
great
many
wonderful
place
,
Genoa
and
Florence
among
them
,
and
have
see
so
many
wonderful
sight
,
that
I
be
almost
giddy
when
I
think
what
a
crowd
they
make
.
   
<EOS>
but
you
can
tell
me
so
much
more
about
them
than
I
can
tell
you
,
that
why
should
I
tire
you
with
my
account
and
description
?
   
<EOS>
dear
Mr
Clennam
,
as
I
have
the
courage
to
tell
you
what
the
familiar
difficulty
in
my
travel
mind
be
before
,
I
will
not
be
a
coward
now
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
my
frequent
thought
be
this
:
---
 
old
as
these
city
be
,
their
age
itself
be
hardly
so
curious
,
to
my
reflection
,
as
that
they
should
have
be
in
their
place
all
through
those
day
when
I
do
not
even
know
of
the
existence
of
more
than
two
or
three
of
them
,
and
when
I
scarcely
know
of
anything
outside
our
old
wall
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
melancholy
in
it
,
and
I
do
not
know
why
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
go
to
see
the
famous
lean
tower
at
Pisa
,
it
be
a
bright
sunny
day
,
and
it
and
the
building
near
it
look
so
old
,
and
the
earth
and
the
sky
look
so
young
,
and
its
shadow
on
the
ground
be
so
soft
and
retired
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
at
first
think
how
beautiful
it
be
,
or
how
curious
,
but
I
think
,
"
o
how
many
time
when
the
shadow
of
the
wall
be
fall
on
our
room
,
and
when
that
weary
tread
of
foot
be
go
up
and
down
the
yard
---
<EOS>
o
how
many
time
this
place
be
just
as
quiet
and
lovely
as
it
be
to
-
day
!
"
 
<EOS>
It
quite
overpower
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
be
so
full
that
tear
burst
out
of
my
eye
,
though
I
do
what
I
could
to
restrain
them
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
the
same
feeling
often
---
often
.
   
<EOS>
do
you
know
that
since
the
change
in
our
fortune
,
though
I
appear
to
myself
to
have
dream
more
than
before
,
I
have
always
dream
of
myself
as
very
young
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
very
old
,
you
may
say
.
<EOS>
no
,
but
that
be
not
what
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
always
dream
of
myself
as
a
child
learn
to
do
needlework
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
dream
of
myself
as
back
there
,
see
face
in
the
yard
little
know
,
and
which
<EOS>
I
should
have
think
I
have
quite
forget
;
but
,
as
often
as
not
,
I
have
be
abroad
here
---
in
Switzerland
,
or
France
,
or
Italy
---
somewhere
where
we
have
be
---
yet
always
as
that
little
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
dream
of
go
down
to
Mrs
General
,
with
the
patch
on
my
clothe
in
which
I
can
first
remember
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
over
and
over
again
<EOS>
dream
of
take
my
place
at
dinner
at
Venice
when
we
have
have
a
large
company
,
in
the
mourning
for
my
poor
mother
which
I
wear
when
I
be
eight
year
old
,
and
wear
long
after
it
be
threadbare
and
would
mend
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
a
great
distress
to
me
to
think
how
irreconcilable
the
company
would
consider
it
with
my
father
's
wealth
,
and
how
I
should
displease
and
disgrace
him
and
Fanny
and
Edward
by
so
plainly
disclose
what
they
wish
to
keep
secret
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
not
grow
out
of
the
little
child
in
thinking
of
it
;
and
at
the
self
-
same
moment
I
have
dream
that
I
have
sit
with
the
heart
-
ache
at
table
,
calculate
the
expense
of
the
dinner
,
and
quite
distract
myself
with
think
how
they
be
ever
to
be
make
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
dream
of
the
change
in
our
fortune
itself
;
I
have
never
dream
of
your
come
back
with
me
that
memorable
morning
to
break
it
;
I
have
never
even
dream
of
you
.
   
<EOS>
dear
Mr
Clennam
,
it
be
possible
that
I
have
think
of
you
---
and
other
---
so
much
by
day
,
that
I
have
no
thought
leave
to
wander
round
you
by
night
.
 
<EOS>
for
I
must
now
confess
to
you
that
I
suffer
from
home
-
sickness
---
that
I
long
so
ardently
and
earnestly
for
home
,
as
sometimes
,
when
no
one
see
me
,
to
pine
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
to
turn
my
face
further
away
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
be
a
little
lighten
when
we
turn
towards
it
,
even
for
a
few
mile
,
and
with
the
knowledge
that
we
be
soon
to
turn
away
again
.
 
<EOS>
so
dearly
do
I
love
the
scene
of
my
poverty
and
your
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
o
so
dearly
,
o
so
dearly
!
   
<EOS>
Heaven
know
when
your
poor
child
will
see
England
again
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
all
fond
of
the
life
here
(
except
me
)
,
and
there
be
no
plan
for
our
return
.

visit
to
London
late
in
this

spring
,
on
some
affair

with
the

but
I
have
no
hope
that
he
will
bring
me

him

<EOS>
I
have
try
to
get
on
a
little
better
under
Mrs
General

instruction

and
I
hope
I
be
not
quite
so
dull
as
I
use
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
begin
to
speak

almost
easily

the
hard

<EOS>
the
famous
name
of
Merdle
become
,
every
day
,
more
famous
in
the
land
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
know
that
the
Merdle
of
such
high
renown
have
ever
do
any
good
to
any
one
,
alive
or
dead
,
or
to
any
earthly
thing
;
nobody
know
that
he
have
any
capacity
or
utterance
of
any
sort
in
him
,
which
have
ever
throw
,
for
any
creature

the
feeble
farthing

candle
ray
of
light
on
any
path
of
duty
or
diversion
,
pain
or
pleasure
,
toil
or
rest
,
fact

fancy
,
among
the
multiplicity
of
path
in
the
labyrinth
trodden
by
the
son
of
Adam

nobody
have
the
small
reason
for
suppose
the
clay
of
which
this
object
of
worship
be
make
,
to
be
other
than
the
common
clay
,
with
as
clog
a
wick
smouldering
inside
of
it
as
ever
keep
an
image
of
humanity
from
tumble
to
piece
.
 
<EOS>
all
people
know
(
or
think
they
know
)
that
he
have
make
himself
immensely
rich
;
and
,
for
that
reason
alone
,
prostrate
themselves
before
him
,
more
degradedly
and
less
excusably
than
the
dark
savage
creep
out
of
his
hole
in
the
ground
to
propitiate
,
in
some
log
or
reptile
,
the
Deity
of
his
benighted
soul
.
   
<EOS>
nay
,
the
high
priest
of
this
worship
have
the
man
before
them
as
a
protest
against
their
meanness
.
 
<EOS>
the
multitude
worship
on
trust
---
though
always
distinctly
know
why
---
but
the
officiator
at
the
altar
have
the
man
habitually
in
their
view
.
 
<EOS>
They
sit
at
his
feast
,
and
he
sit
at
theirs
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
spectre
always
attendant
on
him
,
say
to
these
high
priest
,
"
be
such
the

and
love
to
honour

this

,
these

this
mode
of
speech
,
the
tone
and
manner
of
this
man

<EOS>
You
be
the
lever
of
the
Circumlocution
Office
,
and
the
ruler
of
man
.
 
<EOS>
when
half
-
a

dozen
of
you
fall
out
by
the
ear
,
it
seem
that
mother
earth
can
give
birth
to
no

<EOS>
do
your
qualification
lie
in
the
superior
knowledge
of
man
which
accept

court

<EOS>
or

if
you

aright

I
never

you

your

"
 
<EOS>
two
rather
ugly
question
these
,
always
go
about
town
with
Mr
Merdle
;
and
there
be
a
tacit
agreement
that
they
must
be
stifle

<EOS>
in
Mrs
Merdle
's
absence
abroad
,
Mr
Merdle
still
keep
the
great
house
open
for
the
passage
through
it
of
a
stream
of
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
of
these
take
affable
possession
of
the
establishment

<EOS>

Thursday

"
 
<EOS>
Our
dear
Merdle
would
then
receive
his
instruction
;
and
would
sit
heavily
among
the
company
at
table
and
wander
lumpishly
about
his
drawing

room

only
remarkable

dinner

bosom

and
his
eye
be
a
basilisk
to
Mr
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
hard
man
,
and
would
never
bate
an
ounce
of
plate
or
a
bottle
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
allow
a
dinner
to
be
give
,
unless
it
be
up
to
his
mark
.
 
<EOS>
He
set
forth
the
table
for
his
own
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
guest
choose
to
partake
of
what
be

he
see
no
objection
;
but
it
be

he
seem
to

that

Mr

that
his

in
the
presence
of

he
could
not

do
such

He
would
have
clasp
himself
by

wrist
in

constabulary
manner

and
have
pace
up

down
the
hearthrug

go
creep
about

if
his

the
sly
shadow

condescension

and
why

a

,
that
there
be

<EOS>
Lord
Decimus
have
not
hear
anything
amiss
of
his
peach

but
rather
believe
,
if
his
people
be
correct
,
he
be
to
have
no
apple

<EOS>
no
apple
?
 
<EOS>
Bar

lose

<EOS>
It
would

in
reality
,
if
there
have
not
be
a
pippin
on

but
his
show
of
interest
in
this
apple
question
be
positively
painful
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
to
what
,
Lord
Decimus
---
for
we
troublesome
lawyer
love
to
gather
information
,
and
could
never
tell
how
useful
it
may
prove
to
us
---
to
what
,
Lord

,
be
this
to
be
attribute
?
 
<EOS>
Lord
Decimus
could
not
undertake
to
propound
any
theory
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
this
may
have
stop
another
man
;
but
Bar
,
stick
to
him
fresh
as
ever
,
say
,
"
as
to
pear
,
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
long
after
Bar
get
make
Attorney

General
,
this
be
tell
of
him
as
a
master
-
stroke
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Decimus
have
a
reminiscence
about
a
pear
-
tree
formerly
grow
in
a
garden
near
the
back
of
his
dame
's
house
at
Eton
,
upon
which
pear
-
tree
the
only
joke
of
his
life
perennially
bloom
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
joke
of
a
compact
and
portable
nature
,
turn
on
the
difference
between
Eton
pear
and
parliamentary
pair
;
but
it
be
a
joke
,
a
refined
relish
of
which
would
seem
to
have
appear
to
Lord
Decimus
impossible
to
be
have
without
a
thorough
and
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
tree
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
the
story
at
first
have
no
idea
of
such
a
tree
,
sir
,
then
gradually
find
it
in
winter
,
carry
it
through
the
change
season
,
see
it
bud
,
see
it
blossom
,
see
it
bear
fruit
,
see
the
fruit
ripen
;
in
short
,
cultivate
the
tree
in
that
diligent
and
minute
manner
before
it
get
out
of
the
bed
-
room
window
to
steal
the
fruit
,
that
many
thank
have
be
offer
up
by
belate
listener
for
the
tree
have
be
plant
and
graft
prior
to
Lord
Decimus
's
time
.
 
<EOS>
Bar
's
interest
in
apple
be
so
overtop
by
the
wrapt
suspense
in
which
he
pursue
the
change
of
these
pear
,
from
the
moment
when
Lord
Decimus
solemnly
open
with
"
Your
mention
pear
recall
to
my
remembrance
a
pear
-
tree
,
"
down
to
the
rich
conclusion
,
"
<EOS>
and
so
we
pass
,
through
the
various
change
of
life
,
from
Eton
pear
to
parliamentary
pair
,
"
that
he
have
to
go
down
-
stair
with
Lord
Decimus
,
and
even
then
to
be
seat
next
to
him
at
table
in
order
that
he
may
hear
the
anecdote
out
.
 
<EOS>
by
that
time
,
Bar
feel
that
he
have
secure
the
Foreman
,
and
may
go
to
dinner
with
a
good
appetite
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
dinner
to
provoke
an
appetite
,
though
he
have
not
have
one
.
<EOS>
the
rare
dish
,
sumptuously
cooked
and
sumptuously
serve
;
the
choice
fruit
;
the
most
exquisite
wine
;
marvel
of
workmanship
in
gold
and
silver
,
china
and
glass
;
innumerable
thing
delicious
to
the
sense
of
taste
,
smell
,
and
sight
,
be
insinuate
into
its
composition
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
what
a
wonderful
man
this
Merdle
,
what
a
great
man
,
what
a
master
man
,
how
blessedly
and
enviably
endow
---
in
one
word
,
what
a
rich
man
!
   
<EOS>
He
take
his
usual
poor
eighteenpennyworth
of
food
in
his
usual
indigestive
way
,
and
have
as
little
to
say
for
himself
as
ever
a
wonderful
man
have
.
 
<EOS>
fortunately
Lord
Decimus
be
one
of
those
sublimity
who
have
no
occasion
to
be
talk
to
,
for
they
can
be
at
any
time
sufficiently
occupy
with
the
contemplation
of
their
own
greatness
.
 
<EOS>
this
enable
the
bashful
young
Member
to
keep
his
eye
open
long
enough
at
a
time
to
see
his
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
whenever
Lord
Decimus
speak
,
he
shut
them
again
.
   
<EOS>
the
agreeable
young
Barnacle
,
and
Bar

be
the
talker
of
the

<EOS>
Bishop

worldly
affair
be
too
much
for
him

observable
when
Bar

incidentally

that
he
be
happy
to
have
hear
that
we
be

the
advantage
of

here
Mr

stop
,

look
at
the

cloth

as
he
usually
do
when

himself
observe

<EOS>

be
uncommonly
pleased
to
find
that
the
Merdle

this

have
already
be
bring
into
contact

<EOS>
He
submit
,
in
a
low
voice
across
the
table
to
Bishop
,
that
it
be
a
kind
of
analogical
illustration
of
those
physical

in

which
<EOS>
like
fly
to
like

<EOS>
He
regard
this
power

to
draw
wealth

as
something
remarkably
interesting

curious

something
indefinably
ally

the
loadstone
and
gravitation

<EOS>
Bishop
,
who
have
amble
back
to
earth
again
when
the
present
theme
be
broach
,
acquiesce
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
it
be
indeed
highly
important
to
society
that
one
in
the
try
situation
of
unexpectedly
find
himself
invest
with
a
power
for
good
or
for
evil
in
Society
,
should
become
,
as
it
be
,
merge
in
the
superior
power
of
a
more
legitimate
and
more
gigantic
growth
,
the
influence
of
which
(
as
in
the
case
of
our
friend
at
whose
board
we
sit
)
be
habitually
exercise
in
harmony
with
the
good
interest

thus

instead

glare

a
blended

a
softened
light
whose
genial
ray
diffuse
an
equable
warmth
throughout
the
land

<EOS>
Bishop
seem
to
like
his
own
way
of
put
the
case
very
much
,
and
rather
dwelt
upon
it
;
Bar
,
meanwhile
(
not
to
throw
away
a
jury

,
make
a
show

sit
at
his

feed
on
his

the
dinner
and
dessert

three
hour

a
chilly
time

<EOS>
Lord
Decimus
,
like

tall
tower

flat
country

seem
to
project
himself
across
the
table

cloth
,
hide
the
light
from
the
honourable
member
,
cool
the
honourable
member

marrow

give
him
a
woeful
idea
of
distance

<EOS>
when
he
ask
this
unfortunate
traveller
to
take
wine

he
encompass
his
falter
step

when
he

,
"
Your

all
around
him

at

Lord

with
a
coffee

cup
in

begin
to
hover
about
among
the
picture

to
cause
an
interesting
speculation
to
arise
in
all
mind
as
to
the
probability
of
his
cease
to
hover
,
and
enable
the
small
bird
to
flutter
up

urge
his
noble
pinion
in

direction

after
some
delay

several
stretch
of
his
wing
which
come
to
nothing

he
soar
to
the
drawing

room

<EOS>
and
here
a
difficulty
arise
,
which
always
do
arise
when
two
people
be
specially
bring
together
at
a
dinner
to
confer
with
one
another

<EOS>
everybody
(

have
no
suspicion

know
perfectly
well
that
this
dinner
have
be
eat
and
drunk
,
specifically
to
the
end
that
Lord

and
Mr

should
have
five
minute
'
conversation
together
.
 
<EOS>
the
opportunity
so
elaborately
prepared
be
now
arrive

it
seem
from
that
moment
that
no
mere
human
ingenuity
could
so
much
as
get
the
two
chieftain
into
the
same
room

<EOS>
Mr
Merdle

his
noble
guest
persist
in
prowl
about

opposite
end

It
be
in

for

engage
Ferdinand

bring
Lord

horse
near
Mr

to
tell
him
the
history

unique
dresden
vase

away

while
he
be
get
his
man
up
to

<EOS>
They
be
still

each
with
an
absurd
pretence

in
sweet

"
   
<EOS>
this
drawback
,
rather
severely
feel
by
most
people
who
engage
in
commercial
transaction
with
the
inhabitant
of
Bleeding
Heart
Yard
,
be
a
large
stumbling

block
in
Mrs

trade

<EOS>
when
Mr

have
establish
her

the
business
,
the
Bleeding
Hearts
have
show
an
amount
of
emotion

a
determination

support
her

it

that
do
honour
to
human
nature

<EOS>
recognise
her
claim
upon

influence
by

they

purchase
little
luxury
in
the
grocery
and
butter
line
to
which
they
be
unaccustomed

to
one

that
if
they
do
stretch
a
point

be
it
not
for
a

for
whom
ought
a

so
stimulate

in

if

the

<EOS>
after

He
have

droop

reclaim

this

receive
as
an
assurance
that
he
may
implicitly
rely
on
Pancks

if
he
ever
should
come
to
need
assistance
;
either
in
any
of
the
matter

<EOS>
at
interval
all

investment
of
his
thousand
pound

of
his
have
"
look

He
think

so
sanguine

of

of
the
delight
it
would
be
to
him
to
see

better
off

He
think
of
the
darkly

of
the
gathering
shadow

He

he
see

hear

touch

the

he

it
difficult

a
couple

without
have
it
present
to
one
of

bodily
sense
through
some
agency

other

<EOS>
He
begin
to
think
it
be
curious
too
that
it
should
be
everywhere
,
and
that
nobody
but
<EOS>
he
should
seem
to
have
any
mistrust

though
indeed
he
begin

<EOS>
when
he

even
he

he

perhaps
I
may
say
better
,
and
yet
make
no
boast
of
it

"
   
<EOS>
poor
little
Dorrit
,
not
see
her
way
to
the
offering
of
any
soothing
word
that
would
escape
repudiation
,
deem
it
good
to
remain
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
,
Fanny
take
this
ill
,
too
;
protest
to
her
looking
-
glass
,
that
of
all
the
try
sister
a
girl
could
have
,
she
do
think
the
most
trying
sister
be
a
flat
sister
.
 
<EOS>
that
she
know
she
be
at
time
a
wretched
temper
<EOS>
;
that
she
know
she
make
herself
hateful
;
that
when
she
make
herself
hateful
,
nothing
would
do
her
half
the
good
as
be
tell
so
;
but
that
,
be
afflict
with
a
flat
sister
,
she
never
be
tell
so
,
and
the
consequence
result
that
she
be
absolutely
tempt
and
goad
into
make
herself
disagreeable
.
 
<EOS>
besides
(
she
angrily
tell
her
looking
-
glass
)
,
she
do
not
want
to
be
forgive
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
right
example
,
that
she
should
be
constantly
stoop
to
be
forgive
by
a
young
sister
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
be
the
art
of
it
---
that
she
be
always
be
place
in
the
position
of
be
forgive
,
whether
she
like
it
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
finally
she
burst
into
violent
weeping
,
and
,
when
her
sister
come
and
sit
close
at
her
side
to
comfort
her
,
say
,
"
Amy
,
you
be
an
Angel

<EOS>
"
but
,
I
tell
you
what

say
Fanny
,
when
her

gentleness
have
calm
her

another

partly
on

what
he

through

I
never

no

dance
in

would

just

just

an
earnest

imploring
look

face

bring
the
four
hand
down

lay
only
one
on
Amy
's

"
now

do
not
argue
with
me

child
,
"
she
say
in
a
sterner
way
,

because
it
be
of
no
use

<EOS>
I
understand
these
subject
much
better
than
you
do

<EOS>
I
have
not
nearly
make
up
my
mind
,
but
it
may
be
.
<EOS>
now
we
have
talk
this
over
comfortably
,
and
may
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
You
good
and
dear
little
mouse
,
good
night
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
with
those
word
Fanny
weigh
her
Anchor
,
and
---
have
take
so
much
advice
---
leave
off
be
advise
for
that
occasion
.
   
<EOS>
Thenceforward
,
Amy
observe
Mr
Sparkler
's
treatment
by
his
enslaver
,
with
new
reason
for
attach
importance
to
all
that
pass
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
time
when
Fanny
appear
quite
unable
to
endure
his
mental
feebleness
,
and
when
she
become
so
sharply
impatient
of
it
that
she
would
all
but
dismiss
him
for
good
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
other
time
when
she
get
on
much
better
with
him
;
when
he
amuse
her
,
and
when
her
sense
of
superiority
seem
to
counterbalance
that
opposite
side
of
the
scale
.
 
<EOS>
if
Mr
Sparkler
have
be
other
than
the
faithfull
and
most
submissive
of
swain
,
he
be
sufficiently
hard
press
to
have
flee
from
the
scene
of
his
trial
,
and
have
set
at
least
the
whole
distance
from
Rome
to
London
between
himself
and
his
enchantress
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
no
great
will
of
his
own
than
a
boat
have
when
it
be
tow
by
a
steam
-
ship
;
and
he
follow
his
cruel
mistress
through
rough
and
smooth
,
on
equally
strong
compulsion
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Merdle
,
during
these
passage
,
say
little
to
Fanny
,
but
say
more
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
,
as
it
be
,
force
to
look
at
her
through
her
eye
-
glass
,
and
in
general
conversation
to
allow
commendation
of
her
beauty
to
be
wrung
from
her
by
its
irresistible
demand
.
<EOS>
the
defiant
character
it
assume
when
Fanny
hear
these
extolling
(
as
it
generally
happen
that
she
do
)
,
be
not
expressive
of
concession
to
the
impartial
bosom
;
but
the
utmost
revenge
the
bosom
take
be
,
to
say
audibly
,
"
a
spoilt
beauty
---
but
with
that
face
and
shape
,
who
could
wonder
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
about
a
month
or
six
week
after
the
night
of
the
new
advice
,
when
little
Dorrit
begin
to
think
she
detect
some
new
understanding
between
Mr
Sparkler
and
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
,
as
if
in
attendance
to
some
compact
,
scarcely
ever
speak
without
first
look
towards
Fanny
for
leave
.
 
<EOS>
that
young
lady
be
too
discreet
ever
to
look
back
again
;
but
,
if
Mr
Sparkler
have
permission
to
speak
,
she
remain
silent
;
if
he
have
not
,
she
herself
speak
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
it
become
plain
whenever
Henry
Gowan
attempt
to
perform
the
friendly
office
of
draw
him
out
,
that
he
be
not
to
be
draw
.
 
<EOS>
and
not
only
that
,
but
Fanny
<EOS>
would
presently
,
without
any
pointed
application
in
the
world
,
chance
to
say
something
with
such
a
sting
in
it
that
Gowan
would
draw
back
as
if
he
have
put
his
hand
into
a
bee
-
hive
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
yet
another
circumstance
which
go
a
long
way
to
confirm
Little
Dorrit
in
her
fear
,
though
it
be
not
a
great
circumstance
in
itself
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
's
demeanour
towards
herself
change
.
 
<EOS>
It
become
fraternal
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
when
she
be
in
the
outer
circle
of
assembly
---
at
their
own
residence
,
at
Mrs
Merdle
's
,
or
elsewhere
---
she
would
find
herself
stealthily
support
round
the
waist
by
Mr
Sparkler
's
arm
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sparkler
never
offer
the
slight
explanation
of
this
attention
;
but
merely
smile
with
an
air
of
blundering
,
contented
,
good
-
natured
proprietorship
,
which
,
in
so
heavy
a
gentleman
,
be
ominously
expressive
.
   
<EOS>
little
Dorrit
be
at
home
one
day
,
think
about
Fanny
with
a
heavy
heart
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
a
room
at
one
end
of
their

over
the

,
and
command
all
the
picturesque
life
and
variety
of
the

both
up
and
down

<EOS>
at
three
or
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
english
time
,
the
view
from
this
window
be
very
bright
and
peculiar
;
and
Little
Dorrit
use
to
sit
and
muse
here
,
much
as
she
have
be
use
to
while
away
the
time
in
her
balcony
at
Venice

<EOS>
seat
thus
one
day
,
she
be
softly

and
Fanny
say
,
"
<EOS>

dear
,
"
and
take
her
seat
at
her
side
.
 
<EOS>
Their
seat
be
a
part
of
the
window
;
when
there
be
anything
in
the
way
of
a
procession
go
on
,
they
use
to
have
bright
drapery
hang
out
of
the
window
,
and
use
to
kneel
or
sit
on
this
seat
,
and
look
out
at
it
,
lean
on
the
brilliant
colour
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
procession
that
day
,
and
Little
Dorrit
be
rather
surprised
by
Fanny

at
home
at
that
hour
,
as
she
be
generally

though
,
indeed
,
Mr

it
be
scarcely
necessary
for
me

in
the
mere
openness
of
say
what
be
uppermost
to
one
whom
I
so
highly
regard

with
whom
I
hope
I
may
have
the
pleasure

be
bring
into

more
agreeable
relation

<EOS>
for
one
can
not
but
see
the
great
probability
of
your
consider
such
thing
from
Mr

indeed
that
circumstance

make
it

accidental
fortune

be

child

Mrs

I
be
afraid

Mr

it
may
have
that
tendency

<EOS>
this
skilful
see

saw
of
Mr

so
that
each

send

send
the

down

and
neither
have
the
advantage

sedative
on
Mr

cough

<EOS>
He
remark
with
his
utmost
politeness
,
that
he
must
beg
to
protest
against
its
being
suppose
,
even
by
Mrs

the
accomplished

graceful
(
to

compliment
she
bend
herself

that
such
enterprise

puny
undertaking

"
You

let
us
hope
so

<EOS>
but
I
confess
I
be
almost
superstitious
in
my
idea
about
business

<EOS>
Mr

throw
in
another
compliment
here

to
the
effect

<EOS>
"
I

so
much

sentiment

He

nevertheless

I

my

away
at
Naples

<EOS>
I
be
go
to
say
---
but
you
be
such
a
beloved
little
Marplot
for
put
one
out

when
you
be
leave
alone
here

do
not

it
in

Mrs

your

which
be
not

likely
because
I

go
away

,
my
advice

you
be
,
that
you
say
at
once
,
"
Papa
,
I
beg
to
object
most
strongly

caution
me
about
this
,

she
object
,

I
object
.

"
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
say
that
any
objection
from
you
,
Amy
,
be
likely
to
be
of
the
small
effect
,
or
that
I
think
you
likely
to
make
it
with
any
degree
of
firmness
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
principle
involve
---
a
filial
principle
---
<EOS>
and
I
implore
you
not
to
submit
to
be
mother
-
in
-
lawe
by
Mrs
General
,
without
assert
it
in
make
every
one
about
you
as
uncomfortable
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
expect
you
to
stand
by
it
---
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
know
you
will
not
,
Pa
be
concern
---
but
I
wish
to
rouse
you
to
a
sense
of
duty
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
any
help
from
me
,
or
as
to
any
opposition
that
I
can
offer
to
such
a
match

you
shall
not
be
leave
in
the
lurch
,
my
love
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
weight
I
may
derive
from
my
position
as
a
married
girl
not
wholly
devoid
of
attraction

use
,
as
that
position
always
shall
be
,
to
oppose
that
woman

I
will
bring
to
bear
,
you
May
depend
upon
it
,
on
the
head
and
false
hair
<EOS>
(
for
I
be
confident
it
be
not
all
real
,
ugly
as
it
be
and
unlikely
as
it
appear
that
any
one
in
their
sense
would
go
to
the
expense
of
buy
it

of
Mrs
General

"
<EOS>
little
Dorrit
receive
this
counsel
without
venture
to
oppose
it

without
give
Fanny
any
reason
to
believe
that

to
act
upon
it

Paris

for
the
purchase
of
that

it
would
be
extremely
low

that
unless
the

have
expend
just
one
bushel

<EOS>
but
by

It

<EOS>
other

<EOS>
if
Little
Dorrit
find
herself
leave
a
little
lonely
and
a
little
low
that
night
,
nothing
would
have
do
so
much
against
her
feeling
of
depression
as
the
be
able
to
sit
at
work
by

father
,
as
in

and
help
him
to
his

but
that
be

if
Mr

have
want
supper
,
there
be
an

who
must
have
put

as
high
as

and
have
perform
the
mystery
of
Alchemists
in
a
copper

saucepane
laboratory
below

before
he
could
have
get
it
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
sententious
and
didactic
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
be
simply
love
,
he
would
have
do
Little
Dorrit
more
good
;
but
she

when
have
she

and

<EOS>
Her

It

with

<EOS>
at

a

and
Mr

daughter
that
day
begin
,
in

,
her
competition
with
that
woman
not
present
;
and
begin
it
so
well
that
Mr

could
all
but
have
take
his
affidavit
,
if
require
,
that
Mrs
Sparkler
have
all
her
life
be
lie

next
day
,
and
the

after
,
and
every

more

,
card
descend
on
Mr

like
theatrical

<EOS>
as

Everybody

want
to
make

improve
Mr

<EOS>
in
Mr

heap
of
office
in
the
City

when
Mr

appear
at
any
of
them
on
his
business
take
him
Eastward
(
which
it
frequently
do
,
for
it
throve
amazingly
)
,
the
name
of
Dorrit
be
always
a
passport
to
the
great
presence
of
Merdle
.
 
<EOS>
so
the
dream
increase
in
rapture
every
hour
,
as
Mr
Dorrit
feel
increasingly
sensible
that
this
connection
have
bring
him
forward
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
only
one
thing
sit
otherwise
than
auriferously
,
and
at
the
same
time
lightly
,
on
Mr
Dorrit
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
Chief
Butler
.
 
<EOS>
that
stupendous
character
look
at
him
,
in
the
course
of
his
official
look
at
the
dinner
,
in
a
manner
that
Mr
Dorrit
consider
questionable
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
at
him
,
as
he
pass
through
the
hall
and
up
the
staircase
,
go
to
dinner
,
with
a
glazed
fixedness
that
Mr
Dorrit
do
not
like
.
 
<EOS>
seat
at
table
in
the
act
of
drinking
,
Mr
Dorrit
still
see
him
through
his
wine
-
glass
,
regard
him
with
a
cold
and
ghostly
eye
.
 
<EOS>
It
misgave
him
that
the
Chief
Butler
must
have
know
a
Collegian
,
and
must
have
see
him
in
the
College
---
perhaps
have
be
present
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
as
closely
at
the
Chief
Butler
as
such
a
man
could
be
look
at
,
and
yet
he
do
not
recall
that
he
have
ever
see
him
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
ultimately
he
be
inclined
to
think
that
there
be
no
reverence
in
the
man
,
no
sentiment
in
the
great
creature
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
not
relieve
by
that
;
for
,
let
him
think
what
he
would
,
the
Chief
Butler
have
him
in
his
supercilious
eye
,
even
when
that
eye
be
on
the
plate
and
other
table
-
garniture
;
and
he
never
let
him
out
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
to
hint
to
him
that
this
confinement
in
his
eye
be
disagreeable
,
or
to
ask
him
what
he
mean
,
be
an
act
too
daring
to
venture
upon
;
his
severity
with
his
employer
and
their
visitor
be
terrific
,
and
he
never
permit
himself
to
be
approach
with
the
slight
liberty
.

<EOS>
when
Mr

,
who
attend
her
to
the
room

door

have
have
a
little
time
to
collect
his
sense

he
find
that
the

have
summon
back
discard
reminiscence
which
jar
with

Merdle
dinner

table

write

send
off
a
brief
note
excuse

for
that
day

order
dinner
presently
in
his
own
room
at
the
hotel

<EOS>
He
have
another
reason
for
this
.
 
<EOS>
His
time
in
London
be
very
nearly
out
,
and
be
anticipate
by
engagement
;
his
plan
be
make
for
return
;
and
he
think
it
behove
his
importance
to
pursue
some
direct
inquiry
into
the
Blandois
disappearance
,
and
be
in
a
condition
to
carry
back
to
Mr
Henry
Gowan
the
result
of
his
own
personal
investigation

<EOS>
He
therefore
resolve
that
he
would
take
advantage
of
that
evening
's
freedom
to
go
down
to
Clennam
and
Co

,
easily
to
be
find
by
the
direction
set
forth
in
the
handbill

and
see
the
place
,
and
ask
a
question
or
two
there
himself
.
   
<EOS>
have
dine
as
plainly
as
the
establishment
and
the
Courier
would
let
him
,
and
have
take
a
short
sleep
by
the
fire
for
his
well
recovery
from
Mrs
Finching
,
he
set
out
in
a
hackney
-
cabriolet
alone
.
 
<EOS>
the
deep
bell
of
St

be
strike
nine
as
he
pass
under
the
shadow
of
Temple
Bar
,
headless
and
forlorn
in
these
degenerate
day
.
   
<EOS>
as
he
approach
his
destination
through
the
by

street
and
water
-
side
way
,
that
part
of
London
seem
to
him
an
uglier
spot
at
such
an
hour
than
he
have
ever
suppose
it
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
many
long
year
have
pass
since
he
have
see
it
;
he
have
never
know
much
of
it
;
and
it
wear
a
mysterious
and
dismal
aspect
in
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
so
powerfully
be
his
imagination
impress
by
it
,
that
when
his
driver
stop
,
after
have
ask
the
way
more
than
once
,
and
say
to
the
good
of
his
belief
this
be
the
gateway
they
want
,
Mr
Dorrit
stand
hesitate
,
with
the
coach
-
door
in
his
hand
,
half
afraid
of
the
dark
look
of
the
place
.
   
<EOS>
truly
,
it
look
as
gloomy
that
night
as
even
it
have
ever
look
.
<EOS>
two
of
the
handbill
be
post
on
the
entrance
wall

one
on
either
side
,
and
as
the
lamp
flicker
in
the
night
air
,
shadow
pass
over
them
,
not

the
shadow
of
finger
follow
the
line

<EOS>
a
watch
be
evidently
keep
upon
the
place

<EOS>
as
Mr

pause
,
a
man
pass
in
from
over
the
way
,
and
another
man
pass
out
from
some
dark
corner
within
;
and
both
look
at
him
in
passing
,
and
both
remain
stand
about
.
   
<EOS>
as
there
be
only
one
house
in
the
enclosure
,
there
be
no
room
for
uncertainty
,
so
he
go
up
the
step
of
that
house
and
knock
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
dim
light
in
two
window
on
the
first

floor
.
 
<EOS>
the
door
give
back
a
dreary
,
vacant
sound
,
as
though
the
house
be
empty
;
but
it
be
not
,
for
a
light
be
visible
,
and
a
step
be
audible
,
almost
directly
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
come
to
the
door

and
a
chain
grate

glad
enough
of
the
opportunity

his

which
the
air

<EOS>
as
he
step
back

preparatory

he

observe
how
gloomily

and
fixedly
she
sit
with
her
eye
fasten
on
the
ground

a
certain
air
upon

softly
rub
his
chin

at
that
moment

Mistress
Affery

woman
with

apron

drop
the
candlestick
she
hold

if
there
be
any
sound

it
be
so
slight
that
she
must
have
fall
into
a
confirmed
habit
of
listen
for
sound
;
but
Mr
Dorrit
believe
he
do
hear
a
something
,
like
the
falling
of
dry
leave
.
 
<EOS>
the
woman
's
terror
,
for
a
very
short
space

seem
to
touch
the
three

Mr

be
the
first
to

<EOS>
"
Affery

he

sidle
at
her
with
his
fist
clench
,

his
elbow
quiver
with
impatience
to
shake
her

a
comfortable
dose

"
   
<EOS>
It
do
not
appear
altogether
comfortable
in
expectation
to
Mistress
Affery
;
but
Jeremiah
,
without
further
reference
to
his
healing
medicine
,
take
another
candle
from
Mrs
Clennam
's
table
,
and

,
"
now

I
light
you
down

<EOS>
Mr

profess
himself

down

<EOS>
Mr

shut
him
out

hotly

by
a

him
whether

a
conflict
in

for
some
odd
reason

vaguely
dissatisfied

even
at

in
a

frightfully

It

him
hot

what

His

<EOS>
arrive
at
Paris

rest
there
three
day

Mr

stroll
much
about
the
street
alone
,
look
in
at
the
shop

window
,
and
particularly
the
jeweller
'
window
.
 
<EOS>
ultimately
,
he
go
into
the
most
famous
jeweller
's
,
and
say
he
want
to
buy
a
little
gift
for
a
lady
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
charming
little
woman
to
whom
he
say
it
---
a
sprightly
little
woman
,
dress
in
perfect
taste
,
who
come
out
of
a
green
velvet
bower
to
attend
upon
him
,
from
post
up
some
dainty
little
book
of
account
which
one
could
hardly
suppose
to
be
rule
for
the
entry
of
any
article
more
commercial
than
kiss
,
at
a
dainty
little
shine
desk
which
look
in
itself
like
a
sweetmeat
.
   
<EOS>
for
example
,
then
,
say
the
little
woman
,
what
specie
of
gift
do
Monsieur
desire
?
 
<EOS>
a
love
-
gift
?
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
smile
,
and
say
,
eh
,
well
!
 
<EOS>
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
what
do
he
know
?
<EOS>
It
be
always
possible
;
the
sex
be
so
charming
.
 
<EOS>
Would
she
show
him
some
?
   
<EOS>
most
willingly
,
say
the
little
woman
.
 
<EOS>
Flattered
and
enchant
to
show
him
many
.
 
<EOS>
but
pardon
!
 
<EOS>
to
begin
with
,
he
would
have
the
great
goodness
to
observe
that
there
be
love
-
gift
,
and
there
be
nuptial
gift
.
 
<EOS>
for
example
,
these
ravish
ear
-
ring
and
this
necklace
so
superb
to
correspond
,
be
what
one
call
a
love
-
gift
.
<EOS>
these
brooch
and
these
ring
,
of
a
beauty
so
gracious
and
celestial
,
be
what
one
call
,
with
the
permission
of
Monsieur
,
nuptial
gift
.
   
<EOS>
perhaps
it
would
be
a
good
arrangement
,
Mr
Dorrit
hint
,
smile
,
to
purchase
both
,
and
to
present
the
love
-
gift
first
,
and
to
finish
with
the
nuptial
offering
?
   
<EOS>
ah
Heaven
!
 
<EOS>
say
the
little
woman
,
lay
the
tip
of
the
finger
of
her
two
little
hand
against
each
other
,
that
would
be
generous
indeed
,
that
would
be
a
special
gallantry
!
 
<EOS>
and
without
doubt
the
lady
so
crush
with
gift
would
find
them
irresistible
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
be
not
sure
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
for
example
,
the
sprightly
little
woman
be
very
sure
of
it
,
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
so
Mr
Dorrit
buy
a
gift
of
each
sort
,
and
pay
handsomely
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
stroll
back
to
his
hotel
afterwards
,
he
carry
his
head
high
:
have
plainly
get
up
his
castle
now
to
a
much
lofty
altitude
than
the
two
square
tower
of
Notre
Dame
.
   
<EOS>
build
away
with
all
his
might
,
but
reserve
the
plan
of
his
castle
exclusively
for
his
own
eye
,
Mr
Dorrit
post
away
for
Marseilles
.
 
<EOS>
build
on
,
build

busily
,
busily
,
from
morning
to
night

<EOS>
fall
asleep
,
and
leave
great
block
of
building
material
dangle
in
the
air
;
wake
again
,
to
resume
work
and
get
them
into
their
place
.
 
<EOS>
what
time
the
Courier
in
the
rumble
,
smoke
Young
john
's
good
cigar
,
leave
a
little
thread
of
thin
light
smoke
behind
---
perhaps
as
he
build
a
castle
or
two
with
stray
piece
of
Mr
Dorrit
's
money
.
   
<EOS>
not
a
fortified
town
that
they
pass
in
all
their
journey
be
as
strong
,
not
a
cathedral
summit
be
as
high
,
as
Mr

's
castle
.
<EOS>
neither
the
Saone
nor
the
Rhone
speed
with
the
swiftness
of
that
peerless
building
;
nor
be
the
Mediterranean
deeper

its
foundation

nor

the
distant
landscape
on
the
Cornice
road

nor
the

the
Superb

more
beautiful

<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
and
his
matchless
castle
be
disembark
among
the
dirty
white
house
and
dirty
felon
of
Civita
Vecchia
,
and
thence
scramble
on
to
Rome
as

through

<EOS>
the
storming
of
the
Castle
in
the
air
 
<EOS>
the
sun
have
go
down
full
four
hour
,
and
it
be
later
than
most
traveller
would
like
it
to
be
for
find
themselves
outside
the
wall
of
Rome
,
when
Mr
Dorrit
's
carriage
,
still
on
its
last
wearisome
stage
,
rattle
over
the
solitary
Campagna
.
 
<EOS>
the
savage
herdsman
and
the
fierce
-
look
peasant
who
have
chequer
the
way
while
the
light
last
,
have
all
go
down
with
the
sun
,
and
leave
the
wilderness
blank
.
 
<EOS>
at
some
turn
of
the
road
,
a
pale
flare
on
the
horizon
,
like
an
exhalation
from
the
ruin
-
sow
land
,
show
that
the
city
be
yet
far
off
;
but
this
poor
relief
be
rare
and
short
-
lived
.
 
<EOS>
the
carriage
dip
down
again
into
a
hollow
of
the
black
dry
sea
,
and
for
a
long
time
there
be
nothing
visible
save
its
petrified
swell
and
the
gloomy
sky
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
,
though
he
have
his
castle
-
building
to
engage
his
mind
,
could
not
be
quite
easy
in
that
desolate
place
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
far
more
curious
,
in
every
swerve
of
the
carriage
,
and
every
cry
of
the
postilion
,
than
he
have
be
since
he
quit
London
.
 
<EOS>
the
valet
on
the
box
evidently
quake
.
 
<EOS>
the
Courier
in
the
rumble
be
not
altogether
comfortable
in
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
as
often
as
Mr
Dorrit
let
down
the
glass
and
look
back
at
him
(
which
be
very
often
)
,
he
see
him
smoke
John
Chivery
out
,
it
be
true
,
but
still
generally
stand
up
the
while
and
look
about
him
,
like
a
man
who
have
his
suspicion
,
and
keep
upon
his
guard
.
 
<EOS>
then
would
Mr
Dorrit
,
pull
up
the
glass
again
,
reflect
that
those
postilion
be
cut
-
throat
looking
fellow
,
and
that
he
would
have
do
better
to
have
sleep
at
Civita
Vecchia
,
and
have
start
betime
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
for
all
this
,
he
work
at
his
castle
in
the
interval
.
   
<EOS>
and
now
,
fragment
of
ruinous
enclosure
,
yawn
window
-
gap
and
crazy
wall
,
deserted
house
,
leak
well
,
broken
water
-
tank
,
spectral
cypress
-
tree
,
patch
of
tangled
vine
,
and
the
changing
of
the
track
to
a
long
,
irregular
,
disorder
lane
where
everything
be
crumble
away
,
from
the
unsightly
building
to
the
jolt
road
---
now
,
these
object
show
that
they
be
near
Rome
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
,
a
sudden
twist
and
stoppage
of
the
carriage
inspire
Mr
Dorrit
with
the
mistrust
that
the
brigand
moment
be
come
for
twist
him
into
a
ditch
and
rob
him
;
until
,
let
down
the
glass
again
and
look
out
,
he
perceive
himself
assail
by
nothing
bad
than
a
funeral
procession
,
which
come
mechanically
chaunte
by
,
with
an
indistinct
show
of
dirty
vestment
,
lurid
torch
,
swinge
censer
,
and
a
great
cross
borne
before
a
priest
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
an
ugly
priest
by
torchlight
;
of
a
lower
aspect
,
with
an
overhang
brow
;
and
as
his
eye
meet
those
of
Mr
Dorrit
,
look
bareheade
out
of
the
carriage
,
his
lip
,
move
as
they
chaunte
,
seem
to
threaten
that
important
traveller
;
likewise
the
action
of
his
hand
,
which
be
in
fact
his
manner
of
return
the
traveller
's
salutation
,
seem
to
come
in
aid
of
that
menace
.
 
<EOS>
so
think
Mr
Dorrit
,
make
fanciful
by
the
weariness
of
building
and
travelling
,
as
the
priest
drift
past
him
,
and
the
procession
straggle
away
,
take
its
dead
along
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
upon
their
so
-
different
way
go
Mr
Dorrit
's
company
too
;
and
soon
,
with
their
coach
load
of
luxury
from
the
two
great
capital
of
Europe
,
they
be
(
like
the
Goths
reverse
)
beat
at
the
gate
of
Rome
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Dorrit
be
not
expect
by
his
own
people
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
;
but
they
have
give
him
up
until
to
-
morrow
,
not
doubt
that
it
be
later
than
he
would
care
,
in
those
part
,
to
be
out
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
when
his
equipage
stop
at
his
own
gate
,
no
one
but
the
porter
appear
to
receive
him
.
 
<EOS>
be
Miss
Dorrit
from
home
?
 
<EOS>
he
ask
.
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
within
.
 
<EOS>
Good
,
say
Mr
Dorrit
to
the
assemble
servant
;
let
them
keep
where
they
be
;
let
them
help
to
unload
the
carriage
;
he
would
find
Miss
Dorrit
for
himself
.
<EOS>
so
he
go
up
his
grand
staircase
,
slowly
,
and
tired
,
and
look
into
various
chamber
which
be
empty
,
until
he
see
a
light
in
a
small
ante
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
curtain
nook
,
like
a
tent
,
within
two
other
room
;
and
it
look
warm
and
bright
in
colour
,
as
he
approach
it
through
the
dark
avenue
they
make
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
drape
doorway
,
but
no
door
;
and
as
he
stop
here
,
look
in
unseen
,
he
feel
a
pang
.
 
<EOS>
surely
not
like
jealousy
?
 
<EOS>
for
why
like
jealousy
?
 
<EOS>
there
be
only
his
daughter
and
his
brother
there
:
he
,
with
his
chair
draw
to
the
hearth
,
enjoy
the
warmth
of
the
evening
wood
fire
;
she
seat
at
a
little
table
,
busy
with
some
embroidery
work
.
 
<EOS>
allow
for
the
great
difference
in
the
still
-
life
of
the
picture
,
the
figure
be
much
the
same
as
of
old
;
his
brother
be
sufficiently
like
himself
to
represent
himself
,
for
a
moment
,
in
the
composition
.
 
<EOS>
so
have
he
sit
many
a
night
,
over
a
coal
fire
far
away
;
so
have
she
sit
,
devoted
to
him
.
<EOS>
yet
surely
there
be
nothing
to
be
jealous
of
in
the
old
miserable
poverty
.
 
<EOS>
Whence
,
then
,
the
pang
in
his
heart
?
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
,
uncle
,
I
think
you
be
grow
young
again
?
"
   
<EOS>
Her
uncle
shake
his
head
and
say
,
"

since
when

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"

<EOS>
It
be

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
in
it
but
your

say
Little

cheerfully

<EOS>
"

murmur
the
old

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
She
pause
for
an
instant
in
her
work
to
look
at
him
,
and
her
look
revive
that
former
pain
in
her
father
's
breast
;
in
his
poor
weak
breast
,
so
full
of
contradiction
,
vacillation
,
inconsistency
,
the
little
peevish
perplexity
of
this
ignorant
life
,
mist
which
the
morning
without
a
night
only
can
clear
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
free

you

say
the
old

since

I

two
occasion
in

meal

when
he
all
of
a
sudden
looked
at
her

look
about
him

as
if
the
association
be
so
strong
that
he
need
assurance
from
his
sense
of
sight
that
they
be
not
in

he
express
the
great
pity

he
be
almost
bitter
upon

tediousness
of

Dorrit

always
remember
that
,
when

look
about

under
the
strong
influence
of
the
old
association

he
try
to
keep
it
out
of
her
mind
,
and
perhaps
out
of
his

too
,
by
immediately
expatiate
on
the
great
rich
and
great
company
that
have
encompass
him
in
his
absence

on
the
lofty
position
he

have
to
sustain

nor
do
she
fail
to
recall
that
there

two
under

current

side
by
side

pervade
all
his
discourse

all
his
manner
;
one
show
her
how
well
he
have
get
on
without
her
,
and
how
independent
he
be
of
her
;
<EOS>
the
other
,
in
a
fitful
and
unintelligible
way
almost
complain
of
her
,
as
if
it
have
be
possible
that
she
have
neglect
him
while
he
be
away

His
tell

of

of
the
court
that
bow

him
to

so
naturally
indeed
,
that
although
there
be
an
unusual
want
of
sequence
in

part
of

he
pass
to

He
check
himself
,
as
abruptly
as
he
have
break
into
this
reply
,
and
say
,
"

<EOS>
with
that
he
go
,
more
slowly
and
more
tired
,
up
the
staircase
to
his
room
,
and
,
almost
as
soon
as
he
get
there
,
dismiss
his
valet
.
 
<EOS>
His
next
care
be
to
look
about
him
for
his
Paris
purchase
,
and
,
after
open
their
case
and
carefully
survey
them
,
to
put
them
away
under
lock
and
key
.
<EOS>
after
that
,
what
with
dozing
and
what
with
castle
-
building
,
he
lose
himself
for
a
long
time
,
so
that
there
be
a
touch
of
morning
on
the
eastward
rim
of
the
desolate
Campagna
when
he
creep
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs

her
compliment

good
time
next

well

fatiguing
journey

He
send
down
his
compliment
,
and
beg
to
inform
Mrs
General
that
he
have
rest
very
well
indeed
,
and
be
in
high
condition
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
do
not
come
forth
from
his
own
room
until
late
in
the
afternoon
;
and
,
although
he
then
cause
himself
to
be
magnificently
array
for
a
drive
with
Mrs
General
and
his
daughter
,
his
appearance
be
scarcely
up
to
his
description
of
himself
.
<EOS>
as
the
family
have
no
visitor
that
day
,
its
four
member
dine
alone
together

<EOS>
He
conduct
Mrs
General
to
the
seat
at
his
right
hand
with
immense
ceremony
;
and
little
Dorrit
could
not
but
notice
as
she
follow
with
her
uncle
,
both
that
he
be
again
elaborately
dress
,
and
that
his
manner
towards
Mrs
General
be
very
particular
.
 
<EOS>
the
perfect
formation
of
that
accomplished
lady
's
surface
render
it
difficult
to
displace
an
atom
of
its
genteel
glaze
,
but
little
Dorrit
think
she
descry
a
slight
thaw
of
triumph
in
a
corner
of
her
frosty
eye
.
   
<EOS>
notwithstanding
what
may
be
call
in
these

the
Pruney
and

nature
of
the

banquet

time

asleep
while

be
in

<EOS>
His
fit
of
doze
be
as
sudden
as
they
have
be
overnight
,
and
be
as
short
and
profound
.
<EOS>
when
the
first
of
these
slumbering
seize
him
,
Mrs
General
look
almost
amazed
:
but
,
on
each
recurrence
of
the
symptom
,
she
tell
her
polite
bead
,
Papa
,
Potatoes
,
Poultry
,
Prunes
,
and
Prism
;
and
,
by
dint
of
go
through
that
infallible
performance
very
slowly
,
appear
to
finish
her
rosary
at
about
the
same
time
as
Mr
Dorrit
start
from
his
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
again
painfully
aware
of
a
somnolent
tendency
in
Frederick
(
which
have
no
existence
out
of
his
own
imagination
)
,
and
after
dinner
,
when
Frederick
have

privately
apologise
to
Mrs

for
the
poor
man

Dearest
and
most
precious

He
reply
to
her
fervid
entreaty

that
he
would
never
be

to
get
up
the
narrow
stair
without
Bob

<EOS>
under
pretence

for
Bob

she
get
him
out
against
the
stream
of
gay
company
now
pour
in
for
the
evening
assembly
,
and
get
him
into
a
coach
that

just
set
down
its

,
and
get
him
home
.
   
<EOS>
the
broad
stair
of
his
roman
palace
be
contract
in
his
fail
sight
to
the
narrow
stair
of
his
London
prison

and
he
would
suffer
no
one
but
her
to
touch
him
,
his
brother
except
.
 
<EOS>
They
get
him
up
to
his
room
without
help
,
and
lay
him
down
on
his
bed
.
 
<EOS>
and
from
that
hour
his
poor
maimed
spirit
,
only
remember
the
place
where
it
have
break
its
wing
,
cancel
the
dream
through
which
it
have
since
grope
,
and
know
of
nothing
beyond
the
Marshalsea
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
hear
footstep
in
the
street
,
he
take
them
for
the
old
weary
tread
in
the
yard
.

when
the
hour
come
for
lock
up

he
suppose
all
stranger
to

<EOS>
when
the
time
for
opening
come
again
,
he
be
so
anxious
to
see
Bob
,
that
they
be
fain
to
patch
up
a
narrative
<EOS>
how
that
Bob
---
many
a
year
dead
then
,
gentle
turnkey
---
have
take
cold
,
but
hope
to
be
out
to
-
morrow
,
or
the
next
day
,
or
the
next
at
furth
.
   
<EOS>
He
fall
away
into
a
weakness
so
extreme
that
he
could
not
raise
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
still
protect
his
brother
accord
to
his
long
usage
;
and
would
say
with
some
complacency
,
fifty
time
a
day
,
when
he
see
him
stand
by
his
bed
,
"
My
good
Frederick
,
sit
down
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
very
feeble
indeed
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
try
him
with
Mrs
General
,
but
he
have
not
the
faint
knowledge
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
some
injurious
suspicion
lodge
itself
in
his
brain
,
that
she
want
to
supplant
Mrs
Bangham
,
and
that
she
be
give
to
drink
.
 
<EOS>
He
charge
her
with
it
in
no
measured
term
;
and
be
so
urgent
with
his
daughter
to
go
round
to
the
Marshal
and
entreat
him
to
turn
her
out
,
that
she
be
never
reproduce
after
the
first
failure
.
<EOS>
save
that
he
once
ask
"
if
Tip
have
go
outside
?
<EOS>
"
the
remembrance
of
his
two
child
not
present
seem
to
have
depart
from

<EOS>
but
the
child
who
have
do
so
much
for
him
and
have
be
so
poorly
repay
,
be
never
out
of
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
not
that
he
spare
her
,
or
be
fearful
of
her
be
spend
by
watch
and
fatigue
;
he
be
not
more
troubled
on
that
score
than
he
have
usually
be
.
 
<EOS>
no
;
he
love
her
in
his
old
way
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
in
the
jail
again
,
and
she
tend
him
,
and
he
have
constant
need
of
her
,
and
could
not
turn
without
her
;
and
he
even
tell
her
,
sometimes
,
that
he
be
content
to
have
undergo
a
great
deal
for
her
sake
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
her
,
she
bend
over
his
bed
with
her
quiet
face
against
his
,
and
would
have
lay
down
her
own
life
to
restore
him
.
   
<EOS>
when
he
have
be
sink
in
this
painless
way
for
two
or
three
day
,
she
observe
him
to
be
trouble
by
the
ticking
of
his
watch
---
a
pompous
gold
watch
that
make
as
great
<EOS>
a
to

do
about
its
go
as
if
nothing
else
go
but
itself
and
Time

<EOS>
She
suffer
it
to
run
down
;
but
he
be
still
uneasy
,
and
show
that
be
not
what
he
want
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
he
rouse
himself
to
explain
that
he
want
money
to
be
raise
on
this
watch
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
quite
pleased
when
she
pretend
to
take
it
away
for
the
purpose
,
and
afterwards
have
a
relish
for
his
little
taste
of
wine
and
jelly
,
that
he
have
not
have
before
.
   
<EOS>
He
soon
make
it
plain
that
this
be
so
;
for
,
in
another
day
or
two
he
send
off
his
sleeve
-
button
and
finger
-
ring
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
an
amazing
satisfaction
in
entrust
her
with
these
errand
,
and
appear
to
consider
it
equivalent
to
make
the
most
methodical
and
provident
arrangement

satisfaction

thus
for

lay
her
cheek
against

<EOS>
sometimes
she
be
so
worn
out
that
for
a
few
minute
they
would
slumber
together
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
would
awake

to
recollect
with
fast

flow
silent

what
it
be

touch
her

and
to
see

steal
over

a
deep
shadow

the
shadow
of

"

cry
,
before
they
leave
the

,
with
his

clasped
over

<EOS>
They
remain
in
a
dim
room
near
,
until
it
be
almost
midnight
,
quiet
and
sad
together

<EOS>
at
time
his
grief
would
seek
relief
in
a
burst
like
that
in
which
it
have
find
its
early
expression
;
but
,
besides
that
his
little
strength
would
soon
have
be
unequal

such
strain
,
he
never
fail
to
recall
her
word
,
and
to
reproach
himself
and
calm
himself
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
utterance
with
which
he
indulge
his
sorrow
,
be
the
frequent
exclamation
that
his
brother
be
go

alone
;
that
they
have
be
together
in
the
outset
of
their

that
they
have
fall
into
misfortune
together

that
they
have
keep

together
to

day

They

heavy

sorrowful

She
would
not

anywhere

in

she

him
lie
down
in
his

him
with

<EOS>
then
she
sink
upon

fall
into
a
deep
sleep

<EOS>
the
sleep

He

He
then
refer

Blandois

let

look
round
him
(

judge
for
himself
what
general
intelligence
be
likely

reach
the
ear
of
a
woman
who
have
be
shut
up
there
while

rife

devour
her
own
heart

<EOS>
when
she
have
utter
this
denial

which
he
believe
to
be
true

ask
him
what
he
mean
by
disappearance
?
 
<EOS>
that
lead
to
his
narrate
the
circumstance
in
detail

express
something
of
his
anxiety
to
discover
what
have
really
become
of
the
man
,
and
to
repel
the
dark
suspicion
that
cloud
about
his

house

<EOS>
She
hear
him
with
evident
surprise

with
more
mark

distant

proud

seclude
manner

she

you

good

I

after

to
his
mortification

evidently
more
occupied
with

own
reflection
on

night

her
one

attentive

Clennam
's
look
express
his
heavy
disappointment
,
perhaps
his
incredulity
;
for
she
add
in
the
same
unsympathetic
tone
:

You
do
not
believe
it

<EOS>
still
,
it

so

as

it
seem

personal

declaration

sufficiently
expressive
hint
of
suspicion

convey
in

smile

which

bring

blood
into

come

cruel

will
be

open

take

revenge

no

that

him
prowl

Italy

not

ago

that
I
hire
him
there

I
happen
to
have

I
have
no
objection

him
enough

free

Chapter

history

Self

Tormentor
 
<EOS>
I
have
the
misfortune
of
not
be
a
fool
.
 
<EOS>
from
a
very
early
age
I
have
detect
what
those
about
me
think
they
hide
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
could
have
be
habitually
impose
upon
,
instead
of
habitually
discern
the
truth
,
I
may
have
live
as
smoothly
as
most
fool
do
.
   
<EOS>
My
childhood
be
pass
with
a
grandmother
;
that
be
to
say
,
with
a
lady
who
represent
that
relative
to
me
,
and
who
take
that
title
on
herself
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
no
claim
to
it
,
but
<EOS>
I
---
be
to
that
extent
a
little
fool
---
have
no
suspicion
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
some
child
of
her
own
family
in
her
house
,
and
some
child
of
other
people
.
 
<EOS>
all
girl
;
ten
in
number
,
include
me
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
live
together
and
be
educate
together

<EOS>
I
must
have
be
about
twelve
year
old
when
I
begin
to
see
how
determinedly
those
girl
patronise
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
tell
I
be
an
orphan
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
other
orphan
among
us
;
and
I
perceive
<EOS>
(
here
be
the
first
disadvantage
of
not
be
a
fool
)
<EOS>
that
they
conciliate
me
in
an
insolent
pity
,
and
in
a
sense
of
superiority
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
set
this
down
as
a
discovery
,
rashly
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
them
often
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
make
them
quarrel
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
succeed
with
any
of
them
,
they
be
sure
to
come
after
an
hour
or
two
,
and
begin
a
reconciliation
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
them
over
and
over
again
,
and
I
never
know
them
wait
for
me
to
begin
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
always
forgive
me
,
in
their
vanity
and
condescension

I
love
that
stupid
mite
in
a
passionate
way
that
she
could
no
more
deserve
than
I
can
remember
without
feel
ashamed
of
,
though
I
be
but
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
what
they
call
an
amiable
temper
,
an
affectionate
temper
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
distribute
,
and
do
distribute
pretty
look
and
smile
to
every
one
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
there
be
not
a
soul
in
the
place
,
except
myself
,
who
know
that
she
do
it
purposely
to
wound
and
gall
me
!
   
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
I
so
love
that
unworthy
girl
that
my
life
be
make
stormy
by
my
fondness
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
constantly
lecture
and
disgrace
for
what
be
call
"
try
her
;
"
in
other
word
charge
her
with
her
little
perfidy
and
throw
her
into
tear
by
show
her
that
I
read
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
love
her
faithfully
;
and
one
time
I
go
home
with
her
for
the
holiday
.
   
<EOS>
She
be
bad
at
home
than
she
have
be
at
school
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
a
crowd
of
cousin
and
acquaintance
,
and
we
have
dance
at
her
house
,
and
go
out
to
dance
at
other
house
,
and
,
both
at
home
and
out
<EOS>
,
she
torment
my
love
beyond
endurance
.
 
<EOS>
Her
plan
be
,
to
make
them
all
fond
of
her
---
and
so
drive
me
wild
with
jealousy
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
familiar
and
endearing
with
them
all
---
and
so
make
me
mad
with
envy
them
.
<EOS>
when
we
be
leave
alone
in
our
bedroom
at
night
,
I
would
reproach
her
with
my
perfect
knowledge
of
her
baseness
;
and
then
she
would
cry
and
cry
and
say
I
be
cruel
,
and
then
I
would
hold
her
in
my
arm
till
morning
:
love
her
as
much
as
ever
,
and
often
feel
as
if
,
rather
than
suffer
<EOS>
so
,
I
could
so
hold
her
in
my
arm
and
plunge
to
the
bottom
of
a
river
---
where
I
would
still
hold
her
after
we
be
both
dead
.
   
<EOS>
It
come
to
an
end
,
and
I
be
relieved
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
family
there
be
an
aunt
who
be
not
fond
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
if
any
of
the
family
like
me
much
;
but
I
never
want
them
to
like
me
,
be
altogether
bind
up
in
the
one
girl
.
 
<EOS>
the
aunt
be
a
young
woman
,
and
she
have
a
serious
way
with
her
eye
of
watch
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
an
audacious
woman
,
and
openly
look
compassionately
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
after
one
of
the
night
that
I
have
speak
of
,
I
come
down
into
a
greenhouse
before
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
(
the
name
of
my
false
young
friend
)
have
go
down
before
me
,
and
I
hear
this
aunt
speak
to
her
about
me
as
I
enter
.
<EOS>
I
stop
where
I
be
,
among
the
leave
,
and
listen
.
   
<EOS>
the
aunt
say
,
"
Charlotte
,
Miss
Wade
be
wear
you
to
death
,
and
this
must
not
continue
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
repeat
the
very
word
I
hear
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
what
do
she
answer
?
 
<EOS>
do
she
say
,
"
It
be
I
who
be
wear
her
to
death
,
I
who
be
keep
her
on
a
rack
and
be
the
executioner
,
yet
she
tell
me
every
night
that
she
love
me
devotedly
,
though
she
know
what
I
make
her
undergo
?
"
 
<EOS>
no
;
my
first
memorable
experience
be
true
to
what
I
know
her
to
be
,
and
to
all
my
experience
.
 
<EOS>
She
begin
sob
and
weeping
(
to
secure
the
aunt
's
sympathy
to
herself
)
,
and
say
,
"
dear
aunt
,
she
have
an
unhappy
temper
;
other
girl
at
school
,
besides
I
,
try
hard
to
make
it
well
;
we
all
try
hard
.
"
   
<EOS>
upon
that
the
aunt
fondle
her
,
as
if
she
have
say
something
noble
instead
of
despicable
and
false
,
and
keep
up
the
infamous
pretence
by
reply
,
"
but
there
be
reasonable
limit
,
my
dear
love
,
to
everything
,
and
I
see
that
this
poor
miserable
girl
cause
you
more
constant
and
useless
distress
than
even
so
good
an
effort
justifie
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
poor
miserable
girl
come
out
of
her
concealment
,
as
you
may
be
prepare
to
hear
,
and
say
,
"
send
me
home
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
never
say
another
word
to
either
of
them
,
or
to
any
of
them
,
but
"
send
me
home
,
or
I
will
walk
home
alone
,
night
and
day
!
"
 
<EOS>
when
I
get
home
,
I
tell
my
supposed
grandmother
that
,
unless
I
be
send
away
to
finish
my
education
somewhere
else
before
that
girl
come
back
,
or
before
any
one
of
them
come
back
,
I
would
burn
my
sight
away
by
throw
myself
into
the
fire
,
rather
than
I
would
endure
to
look
at
their
plot
face
.
   
<EOS>
I
go
among
young
woman
next
,
and
I
find
them
no
better
.
 
<EOS>
fair
word
and
fair
pretence
;
but
I
penetrate
below
those
assertion
of
themselves
and
depreciation
of
me
,
and
they
be
no
well
.
<EOS>
before
I
leave
them
,
I
learn
that
I
have
no
grandmother
and
no
recognise
relation
.
 
<EOS>
I
carry
the
light
of
that
information
both
into
my
past
and
into
my
future
.
 
<EOS>
It
show
me
many
new
occasion
on
which
people
triumph
over
me
,
when
they
make
a
pretence
of
treat
me
with
consideration
,
or
do
me
a
service
.
   
<EOS>
a
man
of
business
have
a
small
property
in
trust
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to
be
a
governess
;
I
become
a
governess
;
and
go
into
the
family
of
a
poor
nobleman
,
where
there
be
two
daughter
---
little
child
,
but
the
parent
wish
them
to
grow
up
,
if
possible
,
under
one
instructress
.
 
<EOS>
the
mother
be
young
and
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
first
,
she
make
a
show
of
behave
to
me
with
great
delicacy
.
 
<EOS>
I
keep
my
resentment
to
myself
;
but
I
know
very
well
that
it
be
her
way
of
pet
the
knowledge
that
she
be
my
Mistress
,
and
may
have
behave
differently
to
her
servant
if
it
have
be
her
fancy
.
   
<EOS>
I
say
I
do
not
resent
it
,
nor
do
I
;
but
I
show
her
,
by
not
gratify
her
,
that
I
understand
her
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
press
me
to
take
wine
,
I
take
water
.
 
<EOS>
if
there
happen
to
be
anything
choice
at
table
,
she
always
send
it
to
me
:
but
I
always
decline
it
,
and
eat
of
the
reject
dish
.
 
<EOS>
these
disappointment
of
her
patronage
be
a
sharp
retort
,
and
make
me
feel
independent
.
   
<EOS>
I
like
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
timid
,
but
on
the
whole
disposed
to
attach
themselves
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
nurse
,
however
,
in
the
house
,
a
rosy
-
faced
woman
always
make
an
obtrusive
pretence
of
be
gay
and
good
-
humoured
,
who
have
nurse
them
both
,
and
who
have
secure
their
affection
before
I
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
almost
have
settle
down
to
my
fate
but
for
this
woman
.
 
<EOS>
Her
artful
device
for
keep
herself
before
the
child
in
constant
competition
with
me
,
may
have
blind
many
in
my
place
;
but
I
see
through
them
from
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
pretext
of
arrange
my
room
and
wait
on
me
and
take
care
of
my
wardrobe
(
all
of
which
she
do
busily
)
,
she
be
never
absent
.
 
<EOS>
the
most
crafty
of
her
many
subtlety
be
her
feint
of
seek
to
make
the
child
fonder
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
lead
them
to
me
and
coax
them
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
to
good
Miss
Wade
,
come
to
dear
Miss
Wade
,
come
to
pretty
Miss
Wade
.
 
<EOS>
She
love
you
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Wade
be
a
clever
lady
,
who
have
read
heap
of
book
,
and
can
tell
you
far
better
and
more
interesting
story
than
I
know
.
<EOS>
come
and
hear
Miss
Wade
!
"
 
<EOS>
how
could
I
engage
their
attention
,
when
my
heart
be
burn
against
these
ignorant
design
?
 
<EOS>
how
could
I
wonder
,
when
I
see
their
innocent
face
shrink
away
,
and
their
arm
twine
round
her
neck
,
instead
of
mine
?
 
<EOS>
then
she
would
look
up
at
me
,
shake
their
curl
from
her
face
,
and
say
,
"
They
will
come
round
soon
,
Miss
Wade
;
they
be
very
simple
and
loving
,
madam
;
do
not
be
at
all
cast
down
about
it
,
madam
"
---
exult
over
me
!
   
<EOS>
there
be
another
thing
the
woman
do
.
 
<EOS>
at
time
,
when
she
see
that
she
have
safely
plunge
me
into
a
black
despondent
brooding
by
these
mean
,
she
would
call
the
attention
of
the
child
to
it
,
and
would
show
them
the
difference
between
herself
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
<EOS>
Poor
Miss
Wade
be
not
well
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
make
a
noise
,
my
dear
,
her
head
ache
.
 
<EOS>
come
and
comfort
her
.
 
<EOS>
come
and
ask
her
if
she
be
well
;
come
and
ask
her
to
lie
down
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
nothing
on
your
mind
,
madam
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
take
on
,
madam
,
and
be
sorry
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
become
intolerable
.
 
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
,
my
Mistress
,
come
in
one
day
when
I
be
alone
,
and
at
the
height
of
feeling
that
I
could
support
it
no
longer
,
I
tell
her
I
must
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
the
presence
of
that
woman
Dawes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Wade
!
 
<EOS>
Poor
Dawes
be
devoted
to
you
;
would
do
anything
for
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
know
beforehand
<EOS>
she
would
say
so
<EOS>
;
I
be
quite
prepared
for
it
;
I
only
answer
,
it
be
not
for
me
to
contradict
my
mistress
;
I
must
go
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
Miss
Wade
,
"
she
return
,
instantly
assume
the
tone
of
superiority
she
have
always
so
thinly
conceal
,
"
that
nothing
I
have
ever
say
or
do
since
we
have
be
together
,
have
justify
your
use
of
that
disagreeable
word
,
"
Mistress
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
must
have
be
wholly
inadvertent
on
my
part
.
 
<EOS>
pray
tell
me
what
it
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
reply
that
I
have
no
complaint
to
make
,
either
of
my
mistress
or
to
my
mistress
;
but
I
must
go
.
   
<EOS>
She
hesitate
a
moment
,
and
then
sit
down
beside
me
,
and
lay
her
hand
on
mine
.
 
<EOS>
as
if
that
honour
would
obliterate
any
remembrance
!
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Wade
,
I
fear
you
be
unhappy
,
through
cause
over
which
I
have
no
influence
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
smile
,
thinking
of
the
experience
the
word
awaken
,
and
say
,
"
I
have
an
unhappy
temper
,
I
suppose
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
an
easy
way
of
account
for
anything
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
;
but
I
do
not
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
what
I
wish
to
approach
be
something
very
different
.
 
<EOS>
My
husband
and
I
have
exchange
some
remark
upon
the
subject
,
when
we
have
observe
with
pain
that
you
have
not
be
easy
with
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
easy
?
 
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
You
be
such
great
people
,
my
lady
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
unfortunate
in
use
a
word
which
may
convey
a
meaning
---
and
evidently
do
---
quite
opposite
to
my
intention
.
"
 
<EOS>
(
She
have
not
expect
my
reply
,
and
it
shame
her
.
)
<EOS>
"
I
only
mean
,
not
happy
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
difficult
topic
to
enter
on
;
but
,
from
one
young
woman
to
another
,
perhaps
---
in
short
,
we
have
be
apprehensive
that
you
may
allow
some
family
circumstance
of
which
no
one
can
be
more
innocent
than
yourself
,
to
prey
upon
your
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
if
so
,
let
us
entreat
you
not
to
make
them
a
cause
of
grief
.
 
<EOS>
My
husband
himself
,
as
be
well
known
,
formerly
have
a
very
dear
sister
who
be
not
in
law
his
sister
,
but
who
be
universally
beloved
and
respected
.
   
<EOS>
I
see
directly
that
they
have
take
me
in
for
the
sake
of
the
dead
woman
,
whoever
she
be
,
and
to
have
that
boast
of
me
and
advantage
of
me
;
I
see
,
in
the
nurse
's
knowledge
of
it
,
an
encouragement
to
goad
me
as
she
have
do
;
and
I
see
,
in
the
child
's
shrink
away
,
a
vague
impression
,
that
I
be
not
like
other
people
.
 
<EOS>
I
leave
that
house
that
night
.
   
<EOS>
after
one
or
two
short
and
very
similar
experience
,
which
be
not
to
the
present
purpose
,
I
enter
another
family
where
I
have
but
<EOS>
one
pupil
:
a
girl
of
fifteen
,
who
be
the
only
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
the
parent
here
be
elderly
people
:
people
of
station
,
and
rich
.
 
<EOS>
a
nephew
whom
they
have
bring
up
be
a
frequent
visitor
at
the
house
,
among
many
other
visitor
;
and
he
begin
to
pay
me
attention
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
resolute
in
repulse
him
;
for
I
have
determine
when
I
go
there
,
that
no
one
should
pity
me
or
condescend
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
write
me
a
letter
.
 
<EOS>
It
lead
to
our
be
engage
to
be
marry
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
a
year
young
than
I
,
and
young
-
look
even
when
that
allowance
be
make
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
on
absence
from
India
,
where
he
have
a
post
that
be
soon
to
grow
into
a
very
good
one
.
 
<EOS>
in
six
month
we
be
to
be
marry
,
and
be
to
go
to
India
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to
stay
in
the
house
,
and
be
to
be
marry
from
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
object
to
any
part
of
the
plan
.
   
<EOS>
I
can
not
avoid
say
he
admire
me
;
but
,
if
I
could
,
I
would
.
<EOS>
Vanity
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
declaration
,
for
his
admiration
worry
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
no
pain
to
hide
it
;
and
cause
me
to
feel
among
the
rich
people
as
if
he
have
buy
me
for
my
look
,
and
make
a
show
of
his
purchase
to
justify
himself
.
 
<EOS>
They
appraise
me
in
their
own
mind
,
I
see
,
and
be
curious
to
ascertain
what
my
full
value
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
resolve
that
they
should
not
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
immovable
and
silent
before
them
;
and
would
have
suffer
any
one
of
them
to
kill
me
sooner
than
I
would
have
lay
myself
out
to
bespeak
their
approval
.
   
<EOS>
He
tell
me
I
do
not
do
myself
justice
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
do
,
and
it
be
because
I
do
and
mean
to
do
so
to
the
last
,
that
I
would
not
stoop
to
propitiate
any
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
concerned
and
even
shocked
,
when
I
add
that
I
wish
he
would
not
parade
his
attachment
before
them
;
but
he
say
he
would
sacrifice
even
the
honest
impulse
of
his
affection
to
my
peace
.
   
<EOS>
under
that
pretence
he
begin
to
retort
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
by
the
hour
together
,
he
would
keep
at
a
distance
from
me
,
talk
to
any
one
rather
than
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
sit
alone
and
unnoticed
,
half
an
evening
,
while
he
converse
with
his
young
cousin
,
my
pupil
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
all
the
while
,
in
people
's
eye
,
that
they
think
the
two
look
nearer
on
an
equality
than
he
and
I.
 
<EOS>
I
have
sit
,
divine
their
thought
,
until
I
have
feel
that
his
young
appearance
make
me
ridiculous
,
and
have
rage
against
myself
for
ever
love
him
.
   
<EOS>
for
I
do
love
him
once
.
 
<EOS>
undeserve
as
he
be
,
and
little
as
he
think
of
all
these
agony
that
it
cost
me
---
agony
which
should
have
make
him
wholly
and
gratefully
mine
to
his
life
's
end
---
I
love
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
bear
with
his
cousin
's
praise
him
to
my
face
,
and
with
her
pretend
to
think
that
it
please
me
,
but
full
well
know
that
it
rankle
in
my
breast
;
for
his
sake
.
 
<EOS>
while
I
have
sit
in
his
presence
recall
all
my
slight
and
wrong
,
and
deliberate
whether
I
should
not
fly
from
the
house
at
once
and
never
see
him
again
---
I
have
love
him
.
   
<EOS>
His
aunt
(
my
mistress
you
will
please
to
remember
)
<EOS>
deliberately
,
wilfully
,
add
to
my
trial
and
vexation
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
her
delight
to
expatiate
on
the
style
in
which
we
be
to
live
in
India
,
and
on
the
establishment
we
should
keep
,
and
the
company
we
should
entertain
when
he
get
his
advancement
.
 
<EOS>
My
pride
rise
against
this
bareface
way
of
point
out
the
contrast
my
marry
life
be
to
present
to
my
then
dependent
and
inferior
position
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppress
my
indignation
;
but
I
show
her
that
her
intention
be
not
lose
upon
me
,
and
I
repay
her
annoyance
by
affect
humility
.
 
<EOS>
what
she
describe
would
surely
be
a
great
deal
too
much
honour
for
me
,
I
would
tell
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
I
may
not
be
able
to
support
so
great
a
change
.
 
<EOS>
think
of
a
mere
governess
,
her
daughter
's
governess
,
come
to
that
high
distinction
!
 
<EOS>
It
make
her
uneasy
,
and
make
them
all
uneasy
,
when
I
answer
in
this
way
.
 
<EOS>
They
know
that
I
fully
understand
her
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
at
the
time
when
my
trouble
be
at
their
high
,
and
when
I
be
most
incensed
against
my
lover
for
his
ingratitude
in
care
as
little
as
he
do
for
the
innumerable
distress
and
mortification
I
undergo
on
his
account
,
that
your
dear
friend
,
Mr
Gowan
,
appear
at
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
intimate
there
for
a
long
time
,
but
have
be
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
He
understand
the
state
of
thing
at
a
glance
,
and
he
understand
me
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
the
first
person
I
have
ever
see
in
my
life
who
have
understand
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
in
the
house
three
time
before
I
know
that
he
accompany
every
movement
of
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
in
his
coldly
easy
way
with
all
of
them
,
and
with
me
,
and
with
the
whole
subject
,
I
see
it
clearly
.
 
<EOS>
in
his
light
protestation
of
admiration
of
my
future
husband
,
in
his
enthusiasm
regard
our
engagement
and
our
prospect
,
in
his
hopeful
congratulation
on
our
future
wealth
and
his
despondent
reference
to
his
own
poverty
---
all
equally
hollow
,
and
jesting
,
and
full
of
mockery
<EOS>
---
I
see
it
clearly
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
me
feel
more
and
more
resentful
,
and
more
and
more
contemptible
,
by
always
present
to
me
everything
that
surround
me
with
some
new
hateful
light
upon
it
,
while
he
pretend
to
exhibit
it
in
its
good
aspect
for
my
admiration
and
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
like
the
dress
-
up
death
in
the
dutch
series
;
whatever
figure
he
take
upon
his
arm
,
whether
it
be
youth
or
age
,
beauty
or
ugliness
,
whether
he
dance
with
it
,
sing
with
it
,
play
with
it
,
or
pray
with
it
,
he
make
it
ghastly
.
   
<EOS>
You
will
understand
,
then
,
that
when
your
dear
friend
compliment
me
,
he
really
condole
with
me
;
that
when
he
soothe
me
under
my
vexation
,
he
lay
bare
every
smart
wound
I
have
;
that
when
he
declare
my
"
faithful
swain
"
to
be
"
the
most
loving
young
fellow
in
the
world
,
with
the
tender
heart
that
ever
beat
,
"
he
touch
my
old
misgiving
that
I
be
make
ridiculous
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
not
great
service
,
you
may
say
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
acceptable
to
me
,
because
they
echo
my
own
mind
,
and
confirm
my
own
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
I
soon
begin
to
like
the
society
of
your
dear
friend
better
than
any
other
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
perceive
(
which
I
do
,
almost
as
soon
)
that
jealousy
be
grow
out
of
this
,
I
like
this
society
still
better
.
 
<EOS>
had
I
not
be
subject
to
jealousy
,
and
be
the
endurance
to
be
all
mine
?
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
let
him
know
what
it
be
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
delighted
that
he
should
know
it
;
I
be
delighted
that
he
should
feel
keenly
,
and
I
hope
he
do
.
   
<EOS>
More
than
that
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
tame
in
comparison
with
Mr
Gowan
,
who
know
how
to
address
me
on
equal
term
,
and
how
to
anatomise
the
wretched
people
around
us
.
   
<EOS>
this
go
on
,
until
the
aunt
,
my
Mistress
,
take
it
upon
herself
to
speak
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
scarcely
worth
allude
to
;
she
know
I
mean
nothing
;
but
she
suggest
from
herself
,
know
it
be
only
necessary
to
suggest
,
that
it
may
be
well
if
I
be
a
little
less
companionable
with
Mr
Gowan
.
   
<EOS>
I
ask
her
how
she
could
answer
for
what
I
mean
?
 
<EOS>
She
could
always
answer
,
she
reply
,
for
my
meaning
nothing
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
I
thank
her
,
but
say
I
would
prefer
to
answer
for
myself
and
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Her
other
servant
would
probably
be
grateful
for
good
character
,
but
I
want
none
.
   
<EOS>
other
conversation
follow
,
and
induce
me
to
ask
her
how
she
know
that
it
be
only
necessary
for
her
to
make
a
suggestion
to
me
,
to
have
it
obey
?
 
<EOS>
do
she
presume
on
my
birth
,
or
on
my
hire
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
buy
,
body
and
soul
.
 
<EOS>
She
seem
to
think
that
her
distinguished
nephew
have
go
into
a
slave
-
market
and
purchase
a
wife
.
   
<EOS>
It
would
probably
have
come
,
sooner
or
later
,
to
the
end
to
which
it
do
come
,
but
she
bring
it
to
its
issue
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
She
tell
me
,
with
assumed
commiseration
,
that
I
have
an
unhappy
temper
.
 
<EOS>
on
this
repetition
of
the
old
wicked
injury
,
I
withhold
no
longer
,
but
expose
to
her
all
I
have
know
of
her
and
see
in
her
,
and
all
I
have
undergo
within
myself
since
I
have
occupy
the
despicable
position
of
be
engage
to
her
nephew
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
that
Mr
Gowan
be
the
only
relief
I
have
have
in
my
degradation
;
that
I
have
bear
it
too
long
,
and
that
I
shake
it
off
too
late
;
but
that
I
would
see
none
of
them
more
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
never
do
.
<EOS>
Your
dear
friend
follow
me
to
my
retreat
,
and
be
very
droll
on
the
severance
of
the
connection
;
though
he
be
sorry
,
too
,
for
the
excellent
people
(
in
their
way
the
good
he
have
ever
meet
)
,
and
deplore
the
necessity
of
break
mere
house
-
fly
on
the
wheel
.
<EOS>
He
protest
before
long
,
and
far
more
truly
than
I
then
suppose
,
that
he
be
not
worth
acceptance
by
a
woman
of
such
endowment
,
and
such
power
of
character
;
but
---
well
,
well
!
<EOS>
---
   
<EOS>
Your
dear
friend
amuse
me
and
amuse
himself
as
long
as
it
suit
his
inclination
;
and
then
remind
me
that
we
be
both
people
of
the
world
,
that
we
both
understand
mankind
,
that
we
both
know
there
be
no
such
thing
as
romance
,
that
we
be
both
prepared
for
go
different
way
to
seek
our
fortune
like
people
of
sense
,
and
that
we
both
foresaw
that
whenever
we
encounter
one
another
again
we
should
meet
as
the
good
friend
on
earth
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
say
,
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
contradict
him
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
very
long
before
I
find
that
he
be
court
his
present
wife
,
and
that
she
have
be
take
away
to
be
out
of
his
reach
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
her
then
,
quite
as
much
as
I
hate
her
now
;
and
naturally
,
therefore
,
could
desire
nothing
well
than
that
she
should
marry
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
restlessly
curious
to
look
at
her
---
so
curious
that
I
feel
it
to
be
one
of
the
few
source
of
entertainment
leave
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
travel
a
little
:
travel
until
I
find
myself
in
her
society
,
and
in
yours
.
 
<EOS>
Your
dear
friend
,
I
think
,
be
not
know
to
you
then
,
and
have
not
give
you
any
of
those
signal
mark
of
his
friendship
which
he
have
bestow
upon
you
.
   
<EOS>
in
that
company
I
find
a
girl
,
in
various
circumstance
of
whose
position
there
be
a
singular
likeness
to
my
own
,
and
in
whose
character
I
be
interested
and
pleased
to
see
much
of
the
rise
against
swollen
patronage
and
selfishness
,
call
themselves
kindness
,
protection
,
benevolence
,
and
other
fine
name
,
which
I
have
describe
as
inherent
in
my
nature
.
 
<EOS>
I
often
hear
it
say
,
too
,
that
she
have
"
an
unhappy
temper
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
well
understanding
what
be
mean
by
the
convenient
phrase
,
and
want
a
companion
with
a
knowledge
of
what
I
know
,
I
think
I
would
try
to
release
the
girl
from
her
bondage
and
sense
of
injustice
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
occasion
to
relate
that
I
succeed
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
be
together
ever
since
,
share
my
small
mean

<EOS>
who
pass
by
this
Road
so
late
?
 
<EOS>
Arthur
Clennam
have
make
his
unavaile
expedition
to
Calais
in
the
midst
of
a
great
pressure
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
a
certain
barbaric
power
with
valuable
possession
on
the
map
of
the
world
,
have
occasion
for
the
service
of
one
or
two
engineer
,
quick
in
invention
and
determine
in
execution
:
practical
man
,
who
could
make
the
man
and
mean
their
ingenuity
perceive
to
be
want
out
of
the
good
material
they
could
find
at
hand
;
and
who
be
as
bold
and
fertile
in
the
adaptation
of
such
material
to
their
purpose
,
as
in
the
conception
of
their
purpose
itself
.
 
<EOS>
this
Power
,
be
a
barbaric
one
,
have
no
idea
of
stow
away
a
great
national
object
in
a
Circumlocution
Office
,
as
strong
wine
be
hide
from
the
light
in
a
cellar
until
its
fire
and
youth
be
go
,
and
the
labourer
who
work
in
the
vineyard
and
press
the
grape
be
dust
.
 
<EOS>
with
characteristic
ignorance
,
it
act
on
the
most
decided
and
energetic
notion
of
how
to
do
it
;
and
never
show
the
least
respect
for
,
or
give
any
quarter
to
,
the
great
political
science
,
how
not
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
it
have
a
barbarous
way
of
strike
the
latter
art
and
mystery
dead
,
in
the
person
of
any
enlighten
subject
who
practise
it
.
   
<EOS>
accordingly
,
the
man
who
be
want
be
seek
out
and
find
;
which
be
in
itself
a
most
uncivilised
and
irregular
way
of
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
be
find
,
they
be
treat
with
great
confidence
and
honour
(
which
again
show
dense
political
ignorance
)
,
and
be
invite
to
come
at
once
and
do
what
they
have
to
do

<EOS>
in
short
,
they
be
regard
as
man
who
mean
to
do
it

engage
with
other
man
who
mean
it
to

<EOS>
Daniel
Doyce
be
one
of
the
choose
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
foreseeing
at
that
time
whether
he
would
be
absent
month
or
year

<EOS>
the
preparation
for
his
departure
,
and
the
conscientious
arrangement
for
him
of
all
the
detail
and
result
of
their
joint
business

have
necessitate
labour
within
a
short
compass
of

which

occupy
Clennam
day

night
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
slip
across
the
water
in
his
first
leisure
,
and
have
slip
as
quickly
back
again
for
his
farewell

Him
Arthur
now
show

the

Daniel
go
through
it
all

it
all
exceedingly

He
audit
the
account
,
as
if
they
be
a
far
more
ingenious
piece
of
mechanism
than
he
have
ever
construct
,
and
afterwards
stand
look
at

weigh
his
hat
over
his

how

with

suddenly
spring

pounce
upon

with
a
vehemence

absolute

Behold

Mistress
Affery
make
a
Conditional
Promise

her
Dreams
 
<EOS>
leave
alone
,
with
the
expressive
look
and
gesture
of
Mr
Baptist
<EOS>
,
otherwise
Giovanni
Baptista
Cavalletto
,
vividly
before
him
,
Clennam
enter
on
a
weary
day
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
that
he
try
to
control
his
attention
by
direct
it
to
any
business
occupation
or
train
of
thought
;
it
ride
at
anchor
by
the
haunting
topic
,
and
would
hold
to
no
other
idea
.
 
<EOS>
as
though
a
criminal
should
be
chain
in
a
stationary
boat
on
a
deep
clear
river
,
condemn
,
<EOS>
whatever
countless
league
of
water
flow
past
him
,
always
to
see
the
body
of
the
fellow
-
creature
he
have
drown
lie
at
the
bottom
,
immovable
,
and
unchangeable
,
except
as
the
eddy
make
it
broad
or
long
,
now
expand
,
now
contract
its
terrible
lineament
;
so
Arthur
,
below
the
shift
current
of
transparent
thought
and
fancy
which
be
go
and
succeed
by
other
as
soon
as
come
,
see
,
steady
and
dark
,
and
not
to
be
stir
from
its
place
,
the
one
subject
that
he
endeavour
with
all
his
might
to
rid
himself
of
,
and
that
he
could
not
fly
from
.
 
<EOS>
the
assurance
he
now
have
,
that
Blandois
,
whatever
his
right
name
,
be
one
of
the
bad
of
character
,
greatly
augment
the
burden
of
his
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
though
the
disappearance
should
be
account
for
to
-
morrow
,
the
fact
that
his
mother
have
be
in
communication
with
such
a
man
,
would
remain
unalterable
.
 
<EOS>
that
the
communication
have
be
of
a
secret
kind
,
and
that
she
have
be
submissive
to
him
and
afraid
of
him
,
he
hope
may
be
know
to
no
one
beyond
himself
;
yet
,
know
it
,
how
could
he
separate
it
from
his
old
vague
fear
,
and
how
believe
that
there
be
nothing
evil
in
such
relation
?
<EOS>
Her
resolution
not
to
enter
on
the
question
with
him
,
and
his
knowledge
of
her
indomitable
character
,
enhance
his
sense
of
helplessness
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
like
the
oppression
of
a
dream
to
believe
that
shame
and
exposure
be
impend
over
her
and
his
father
's
memory
,
and
to
be
shut
out
,
as
by
a
brazen
wall
,
from
the
possibility
of
come
to
their
aid

<EOS>
the
purpose
he
have
bring
home
to
his
native
country
,

ever
since
keep

be
,
with
her
great
determination
,
defeat
by
his

herself
,
at
the
time
of

fear
that

press
most
.
 
<EOS>
His
advice
,
energy
,
activity
,
money
,
credit
,
all
his
resource
whatsoever
,
be
all
make
useless
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
have
be
possess
of
the
old
fabled
influence
,
and
have
turn
those
who
look
upon
her
into
stone
,
she
could
not
have
render
him
more
completely
powerless
<EOS>
(
so
it
seem
to
him
in
his
distress
of
mind
)
than
she
do
,
when
she
turn
her
unyielding
face
to
his
in
her
gloomy
room
.
   
<EOS>
but
the
light
of
that
day
's
discovery
,
shine
on
these
consideration
,
rouse
him
to
take
a
more
decide
course
of
action
.
   
<EOS>
confident
in
the
rectitude
of
his
purpose
,
and
impel
by
a
sense
of
overhang
danger
close
in
around
<EOS>
,
he
resolve
,
if
his
mother
would
still
admit
of
no
approach
,
to
make
a
desperate
appeal
to
Affery
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
could
be
bring
to
become
communicative
,
and
to
do
what
lie
in
her
to
break
the
spell
of
secrecy
that
enshroud
the
house
,
he
may
shake
off
the
paralysis
of
which
every
hour
that
pass
over
his
head
make
him
more
acutely
sensible
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
result
of
his
day
's
anxiety
,
and
this
be
the
decision
he
put
in
practice
when
the
day
close
in
.
   
<EOS>
His
first
disappointment
,
on
arrive
at
the
house
,
be
to
find
the
door
open
,
and
Mr
Flintwinch
smoke
a
pipe
on
the
step
.
 
<EOS>
if
circumstance
have
be
commonly
favourable
,
Mistress
Affery
would
have
open
the
door
to
his
knock
.
 
<EOS>
circumstance
be
uncommonly
unfavourable
,
the
door
stand
open
,
and
Mr
Flintwinch
be
smoke
his
pipe
on
the
step
.
   
<EOS>
"
good

"

Arthur

<EOS>
"
good
evening

"
say
Mr
Flintwinch

<EOS>
the
smoke
come
crookedly
out
of
Mr
Flintwinch
's
mouth
,
as
if
it
circulate
through
the
whole
of
his
wry
figure
and
come
back
by
his
wry
throat
,
before
come
forth
to
mingle
with
the
smoke
from
the
crooked
chimney
and
the
mist
from
the
crooked
river

<EOS>
"
have
you
any

We

<EOS>
"
\i\
mean
of
the
foreign
man

"
say
Jeremiah
.
   
<EOS>
He
look
so
grim
,
as
he
stand
askew
,
with
the
knot
of
his
cravat
under
his
ear
,
that
the
thought
pass
into
Clennam
's
mind
,
and
not
for
the
first
time
by
many
,
could
flintwinch
for
a
purpose
of
his
own
have
get
rid
of
Blandois
?
 
<EOS>
Could
it
have
be
his
secret
,
and
his
safety
,
that
be
at
issue
?
 
<EOS>
He
be
small
and
bent
,
and
perhaps
not
actively
strong
;
yet
he
be
as
tough
as
an
old
yew
-
tree
,
and
as
crusty
as
an
old
jackdaw
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
man
,
come
behind
a
much
young
and
more
vigorous
man
,
and
have
the
will
to
put
an
end
to
him
and
no
relenting
,
may
do
it
pretty
surely
in
that
solitary
place
at
a
late
hour
.
   
<EOS>
while
,
in
the
morbid
condition
of
his
thought
,
these
thought
drift
over
the
main
one
that
be
always
in
Clennam
's
mind
,
Mr
Flintwinch
,
regard
the
opposite
house
over
the
gateway
with
his
neck
twist
and
one
eye
shut
up
,
stand
smoke
with
a
vicious
expression
upon
him
;
more
as
if
he
be
try
to
bite
off
the
stem
of
his
pipe
,
than
as
if
he
be
enjoy
it
.
 
<EOS>
yet
he
be
enjoy
it
in
his
own
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
able

take
my

Mr

,
drily
,
as
he
stoop
to
knock
the
ashe
out

rather
conscious

confused

Arthur
ask
his
pardon

unpolitely

"
no

say
Mr
Flintwinch
,
very
shortly
and
decidedly
:

much
as
if
he
be
of
the
canine
race

snap
at
Arthur

Mr

turn
short
round
when
he
have
make
this
remark
,
and
go
into
the
dark
hall

Clennam
stand
there
,
follow
him
with
his
eye
,
as
he
dip
for
a
light
in
the
phosphorus

box
in
the
little
room
at
the
side
,
get
one
after
three

four
dip

and
light
the
dim
lamp
against
the
wall

<EOS>
all
the
while
,
Clennam
be
pursue
the
probability
---
rather
as
if
they
be
be
show
to
him
by
an
invisible
hand
than
as
if
he
himself
be
conjure
them
up
---
of
Mr
Flintwinch
's
way
and
mean
of
do
that
darker
deed
,
and
remove
its
trace
by
any
of
the
black
avenue
of
shadow
that
lie
around
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
sir
,
"
say
the
testy
Jeremiah
;
"
will
it
be
agreeable
to
walk
up

"
My

<EOS>
this
be
the
second
disappointment

Arthur
make
no
remark
upon
it

repair
to
his
mother
's
room
,
where
Mr
Casby
and
Flora
have
be
take
tea
,
anchovy
paste
,
and
hot
butter
toast

<EOS>
the
relic
of
those
delicacy
be
not
yet
remove
,
either
from
the
table
or
from
the
scorched
countenance
of
Affery
,
who
,
with
the
kitchen
toasting
-
fork
still
in
her
hand
,
look
like
a
sort
of
allegorical
personage

except
that
she
have
a
considerable
advantage
over
the
general
run
of
such
personage
in
point
of
significant
emblematical
purpose
.
   
<EOS>
Flora
have
spread
her
bonnet
and
shawl
upon
the
bed
,
with
a
care
indicative
of
an
intention
to
stay
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Casby
,
too
,
be
beam
near
the
hob

with
his
benevolent
knob
shine
as
if
the
warm
butter
of
the
toast
be
exude
through
the
patriarchal
skull
,
and
with
his
face
as
ruddy
as
if
the
colouring
matter
of
the
anchovy
paste
be
mantle
in
the
patriarchal
visage
.
 
<EOS>
see
this
,
as
he
exchange
the
usual
salutation
,
Clennam
decide
to
speak
to
his
mother
without
postponement
.
   
<EOS>
It
have
long
be
customary

she
never
change
her
room

for
those
who
have
anything
to
say
to
her

to
wheel
her

speak
together
without
the
intervention
of
a
third
person
,
it
be
an
ordinary
matter
of
course
within
the
experience
of
visitor
for
Mrs
Clennam
to
be
ask
,
with
a
word
of
apology
for
the
interruption
,
if
she
could
be
speak
with
on
a
matter
of
business
,
and
,
on
her
replying
in
the
affirmative
,
to
be
wheel
into
the
position
describe
.
   
<EOS>
therefore
,
when
Arthur
now
make
such
an
apology
,
and
such
a
request
,
and
move
her
to
her
desk
and
seat
himself
on
the
stool
,
Mrs
Finching
merely
begin
to
talk
louder
and
faster
,
as
a
delicate
hint
that
she
could
overhear
nothing
,
and
Mr
Casby
stroke
his
long
white
lock
with
sleepy
calmness
.
   
<EOS>
"
mother
,
I
have
hear
something
to
-
day
which
I
feel
persuaded
you
do
not
know
,
and
which
I
think
you
should
know
,
of
the
antecedent
of
that
man
I
see
here
.

<EOS>

I
know
nothing

here

Arthur

<EOS>
She
speak
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
lower
his
own
voice
;
but
she
reject
that
advance
towards
confidence
as
she
reject
every
other
,
and
speak
in
her
usual
key
and
in
her
usual
stern
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
receive
it
on
no
circuitous
information
;
it
have
come
to
me
direct
.
"
<EOS>
She
ask
him
,
exactly
as
before
,
if
he
be
there
to
tell
her
what
it
be
?
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
right
that
you
should
know
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
and
what
be
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
have
be
a
prisoner
in
a
french
gaol
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
answer
with
composure
,
"
I
should
think
that
very
likely
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
but
in
a
gaol
for
criminal
,
mother
.
 
<EOS>
on
an
accusation
of
murder

"
   
<EOS>
She
start
at
the
word
,
and
her
look
express
her
natural
horror
.
 
<EOS>
yet
she
still
speak
aloud
,
when
she
demand
:
---
   
<EOS>
"
who
tell
you
so
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
a
man
who
be
his
fellow

prisoner

"
   
<EOS>
"
that
man

I
suppose
,

not
know
to

you

"
no

"
yes

"
My
case

Flintwinch

this
other
man

<EOS>
I
dare
say
the
resemblance
be
not
so
exact
,
though
,
<EOS>
as
that
your
informant
become
known
to
you
through
a
letter
from
a
correspondent

he
have

<EOS>
how
do
that
part
of
the
parallel
stand
?
"
   
<EOS>
Arthur
have
no
choice
but
to
say
that
his
informant
have
not
become
known
to
him
through
the
agency
of
any
such
credential

or
indeed
of
any
credential

all

<EOS>
Mrs
Clennam
's
attentive
frown
expand
by
degree
into
a
severe
look
of
triumph
,
and
she
retort
with
emphasis
,
"
take
care

how
you
judge

then

<EOS>
I
say
to
you
,
Arthur

care
how

Her
emphasis
have
be

from
her
eye
quite
as
much
as
from
the
stress
she
lay
upon
her
word
.
 
<EOS>
She
continue
to
look
at
him
;
and
if
,
when
he
enter
the
house
,
he
have
have
any
latent
hope
of
prevail
in
the

with
her

she
now
look
it
out
of
his

so
he

elation
in

face
of
Mr

most
assuredly

<EOS>
this
turning
of
his
intelligence
and
of
his
whole
attempt

design
against

,
do
even
more
than
his
mother
's
fixedness
and
firmness
to
convince

that

idle

nothing

the
appeal

even
to
get
the
very
doubtful
and
preliminary
stage
of
make
the
appeal

seem
one
of

promising
of

be

afraid

over

,
Mistress
Affery
,
by
some
mean
(
it
be
not
very
difficult
to
guess
,
through
the
sharp
argument
of
her
liege
lord
)
,
have
acquire
such
a
lively
conviction
of
the
hazard
of
say
anything
under
any
circumstance
,
that
she
have
remain
all
this
time
in
a
corner
guard
herself
from

so
that

two
have
be
address
to

even
by
the
bottle

green
patriarch
himself

have
ward
off
conversation
with
the
toasting

at

Arthur

expedient

may

to

he
therefore
whisper

in
fluctuate
expectation

renew
his

be
madly
in

again

receive
the
whisper
with
the
utmost
delight

as
render
precious
by
its
mysterious
character

as
prepare

tender
interview

even

confess

It

that

the

say
to

whether

see
the

we

<EOS>
therefore
,
Physician
's
guest
come
out
so
surprisingly
at
his
round
table
that
they
be
almost
natural
.
   
<EOS>
Bar
's
knowledge
of
that
agglomeration
of
juryman
which
be
call
humanity
be
as
sharp
as
a

yet
a
razor
be
not
a
generally
convenient
instrument
,
and
Physician
's
plain
bright
scalpel
,
though
far
less
keen
,
be
adaptable
to
far
wide
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Bar
know
all
about
the
gullibility
and
knavery
of
people
;
but
physician
could
have
give
him
a
well
insight
into
their
tenderness
and
affection
,
in
one
week
of
his
round
,
than
Westminster
Hall
and
all
the
circuit
put
together
,
in
threescore
year

ten

<EOS>
Bar
always
have
a
suspicion
of
this
,
and
perhaps
be
glad
to
encourage
it
(
for
,
if
the

be
really
a
great
Law
Court

one
would
think
that
the
last
day
of

not

so
he
like

respect
physician
quite
as
much
as

<EOS>
Mr

if

,
he
would
have
merely
make
the
difference
of
Banquo
in
it
,
and
consequently
he
be
no

<EOS>
Bar

who
pick

<EOS>
He
now
have
a
little
talk
on
the
subject
with
Mrs

sidle
up

with

"

not

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
why

ridiculous

ask
Mrs

laugh

<EOS>
Bar
wave
his
double
eye

glass
three
or
four
time
between
himself
and
the
Bosom
,
as
a
rallying
answer
,
and
inquire
in
his
most
insinuating
accent
:
   
"
what
be
I
to
call

most
elegant

accomplished

charming
of

do

morrow

<EOS>
this
lead
to
further
passage
of
similar
pleasantry

the
two

Bar

with

his
sharpness

get
nothing
out

them

Mrs

down

on
her
as

put
on
her
cloak

inquire
into
the
symptom
with
his
usual
calm
directness
.
   
<EOS>

May
I
ask

They

there

<EOS>
He
could
not

give
utterance
to

the
small
clue

would
have

he
could

(
this

)
;
so
he
say
he

and
would
loiter

<EOS>
They

be
fast
asleep
in

over

"

demand
the

warmly

<EOS>
the
Chief

,
erect

calm

reply
in
these
memorable
word

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
when
Physician
,
after
discharge
himself
of
his
trust
up

stair
,
rejoin
Bar
in
the
street
,
he
say
no
more
of
his
interview
with
Mrs

than
that
he
have
not
yet
tell
her
all
,
but
that
what
he
have
tell
her
she
have
bear
pretty
well
.
 
<EOS>
Bar
have
devote
his
leisure
in
the
street
to
the
construction
of
a
most
ingenious
man
-
trap
for
catch
the
whole
of
his
jury
at
a
blow
;
have
get
that
matter
settle
in
his
mind
,
it
be
lucid
on
the
late
catastrophe
,
and
they
walk
home
slowly
,
discuss
it
in
every
bearing
.
<EOS>
before
part
at
the
Physician
's
door
,
they
both
look
up
at
the
sunny
morning
sky
,
into
which
the
smoke
of
a
few
early
fire
and
the
breath
and
voice
of
a
few
early
stirrer
be
peacefully
rise
,
and
then
look
round
upon
the
immense
city
,
and
say
,
if
all
those
hundred
and
thousand
of
beggared
people
who
be
yet
asleep
could
only
know
,
as
they
two
speak
,
the
ruin
that
impend
over
them
,
what
a
fearful
cry
against
one
miserable
soul
would
go
up
to
Heaven
!
   
<EOS>
the
report
that
the
great
man
be
dead
,
get
about
with
astonishing
rapidity
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
,
he
be
dead
of
all
the
disease
that
ever
be
know
,
and
of
several
bran
-
new
malady
invent
with
the
speed
of
light
to
meet
the
demand
of
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
conceal
a
dropsy
from
infancy
,
he
have
inherit
a
large
estate
of
water
on
the
chest
from
his
grandfather
,
he
have
have
an
operation
perform
upon
him
every
morning
of
his
life
for
eighteen
year
,
he
have
be
subject
to
the
explosion
of
important
vein
in
his
body
after
the
manner
of
firework
,
he
have
have
something
the
matter
with
his
lung
,
he
have
have
something
the
matter
with
his
heart
,
he
have
have
something
the
matter
with
his
brain
.
 
<EOS>
five
hundred
people
who
sit
down
to
breakfast
entirely
uninformed
on
the
whole
subject
,
believe
before
they
have
do
breakfast
,
that
they
privately
and
personally
know
Physician
to
have
say
to
Mr
Merdle
,
"
You
must
expect
to
go
out
,
some
day
,
like
the
snuff
of
a
candle
;
"
and
that
they
know
Mr
Merdle
to
have
say
to
Physician
,
"
a
man
can
die
but
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
by
about
eleven
o'clock
in
the
forenoon
,
something
the
matter
with
the
brain
,
become
the
favourite
theory
against
the
field
;
and
by
twelve
the
something
have
be
distinctly
ascertain
to
be
"
Pressure
.
"
   
<EOS>
pressure
be
so
entirely
satisfactory
to
the
public
mind
,
and
seem
to
make
everybody
so
comfortable
,
that
it
may
have
last
all
day
but
for
Bar
's
have
take
the
real
state
of
the
case
into
Court
at
half
-
past
nine
.
 
<EOS>
this
lead
to
its
beginning
to
be
currently
whisper
all
over
London
by
about
one
,
that
Mr
Merdle
have
kill
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Pressure
,
however
,
so
far
from
be
overthrow
by
the
discovery
,
become
a
great
favourite
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
general
moralising
upon
Pressure
,
in
every
street
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
people
who
have
try
to
make
money
and
have
not
be
able
to
do
it
,
say
,
there
you
be
!
 
<EOS>
You
no
sooner
begin
to
devote
yourself
to
the
pursuit
of
wealth
than
you
get
pressure
.
 
<EOS>
the
idle
people
improve
the
occasion
in
a
similar
manner
.
 
<EOS>
See
,
say
they
,
what
you
bring
yourself
to
by
work
,
work
,
work
!
 
<EOS>
You
persist
in
work
,
you
overdo
it
.
 
<EOS>
pressure
come
on
,
and
you
be
do
for
!
 
<EOS>
this
consideration
be
very
potent
in
many
quarter
,
but
nowhere
more
so
than
among
the
young
clerk
and
partner
who
have
never
be
in
the
slight
danger
of
overdo
it
.
 
<EOS>
these
,
one
and
all
,
declare
,
quite
piously
,
that
they
hope
they
would
never
forget
the
warning
as
long
as
they
live
,
and
that
their
conduct
may
be
so
regulated
as
to
keep
off
pressure
,
and
preserve
them
,
a
comfort
to
their
friend
,
for
many
year
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
at
about
the
time
of
high
"
Change
,
Pressure
begin
to
wane
,
and
appal
whisper
to
circulate
,
east
,
west
,
north
,
and
south
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
they
be
faint
,
and
go
no
further
than
a
doubt
whether
Mr
Merdle
's
wealth
would
be
find
to
be
as
vast
as
have
be
suppose
;
whether
there
may
not
be
a
temporary
difficulty
in
"
realise
"
it
;
whether
there
may
not
even
be
a
temporary
suspension
(
say
a
month
or
so
)
,
on
the
part
of
the
wonderful
Bank
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
whisper
become
louder
,
which
they
do
from
that
time
every
minute
,
they
become
more
threatening
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
spring
from
nothing
,
by
no
natural
growth
or
process
that
any
one
could
account
for
<EOS>
;
he
have
be
,
after
all
,
a
low
,
ignorant
fellow
;
he
have
be
a
down
-
looking
man
,
and
no
one
have
ever
be
able
to
catch
his
eye
;
he
have
be
take
up
by
all
sort
of
people
in
quite
an
unaccountable
manner
;
he
have
never
have
any
money
of
his
own
,
his
venture
have
be
utterly
reckless
,
and
his
expenditure
have
be
most
enormous
.
 
<EOS>
in
steady
progression
,
as
the
day
decline
,
the
talk
rise
in
sound
and
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
leave
a
letter
at
the
Baths
address
to
his
physician
,
and
his
physician
have
get
the
letter
,
and
the
letter
would
be
produce
at
the
Inquest
on
the
morrow
,
and
it
would
fall
like
a
thunderbolt
upon
the
multitude
he
have
delude
.
 
<EOS>
number
of
man
in
every
profession
and
trade
would
be
blight
by
his
insolvency
;
old
people
who
have
be
in
easy
circumstance
all
their
life
would
have
no
place
of
repentance
for
their
trust
in
him
but
the
workhouse
;
legion
of
woman
and
child
would
have
their
whole
future
desolate
by
the
hand
of
this
mighty
scoundrel
.
 
<EOS>
every
partaker
of
his
magnificent
feast
would
be
see
to
have
be
a
sharer
in
the
plunder
of
innumerable
home
;
every
servile
worshipper
of
rich
who
have
help
to
set
him
on
his
pedestal
,
would
have
do
better
to
worship
the
Devil
point
-
blank
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
the
talk
,
lash
louder
and
high
by
confirmation
on
confirmation
,
and
by
edition
after
edition
of
the
evening
paper
,
swell
into
such
a
roar
when
night
come
,
as
may
have
bring
one
to
believe
that
a
solitary
watcher
on
the
gallery
above
the
Dome
of
St
Paul
's
would
have
perceive
the
night
air
to
be
laden
with
a
heavy
muttering
of
the
name
of
Merdle
,
couple
with
every
form
of
execration
.
   
<EOS>
for
by
that
time
it
be
know
that
the
late
Mr
Merdle
's
complaint
have
be
simply
Forgery
and
Robbery
.

his
fix
resolution

He
tell
Mr
Rugg

he

He
explain
that
his

then
absent

an
enterprise
of
importance

that
it
particularly
behove
himself
publicly
to
accept
the
blame
of
what
he
have
rashly
do
,
and
publicly
to
exonerate
his
partner
from
all
participation
in
the
responsibility
of
it
,
lest
the
successful
conduct
of
that
enterprise
should
be
endanger
by
the
slight
suspicion
wrongly
attach
to
his

honour
and
credit
in
another
country
.
<EOS>
He
tell
Mr
Rugg
that
to
clear
his
partner
morally
,
to
the
full
extent
,
and
publicly
and
unreservedly
to
declare
that
he
,
Arthur
Clennam
,
of
that
firm
,
have
of
his
own
sole
act
,
and
even
expressly
against
his
partner
's
caution
,
embark
its
resource
in
the
swindle
that
have
lately
perish
,
be
the
only
real
atonement
within
his
power
;
be
a
well
atonement
to
the
particular
man
than
it
would
be
to
many
man
;
and
be
therefore
the
atonement
he
have
first
to
make
.
 
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
his
intention
be
to
print
a
declaration
to
the
foregoing
effect
,
which
he
have
already
draw
up
;
and
,
besides
circulate
it
among
all
who
have
dealing
with
the
House
,
to
advertise
it
in
the
public
paper
.
 
<EOS>
concurrently
with
this
measure
(
the
description
of
which
cost
Mr
Rugg
innumerable
wry
face
and
great
uneasiness
in
his
limb
)
,
he
would
address
a
letter
to
all
the
creditor
,
exonerate
his
partner
in
a
solemn
manner
,
inform
them
of
the
stoppage
of
the
House
until
their
pleasure
could
be
know
and
his
partner
communicate
with
,
and
humbly
submit
himself
to
their
direction
.
 
<EOS>
if
,
through
their
consideration
for
his
partner
's
innocence
,
the
affair
could
ever
be
get
into
such
train
as
that
the
business
could
be
profitably
resume
,
and
its
present
downfall
overcome
,
then
his
own
share
in
it
should
revert
to
his
partner
,
as
the
only
reparation
he
could
make
to
him
in
money
value
for
the
distress
and
loss
he
have
unhappily
bring
upon
him
,
and
he
himself
,
at
as
mall
a
salary
as
he
could
live
upon
,
would
ask
to
be
allow
to
serve
the
business
as
a
faithful
clerk
.
   
<EOS>
though
Mr
Rugg
see
plainly
there
be
no
prevent
this
from
be
do
,
still
the
wryness
of
his
face
and
the
uneasiness
of
his
limb
so
sorely
require
the
propitiation
of
a
Protest
,
that
he
make
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
offer
no
objection
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
argue
no
point
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
carry
out
your
view
,
sir
;
but
,
under
protest
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Rugg
then
state
,
not
without
prolixity
,
the
head
of
his
protest
.
<EOS>
these
be
,
in
effect
,
because
the
whole
town
,
or
he
may
say
the
whole
country
,
be
in
the
first
madness
of
the
late
discovery
,
and
the
resentment
against
the
victim
would
be
very
strong
:
those
who
have
not
be
delude
be
certain
to
wax
exceedingly
wroth
with
them
for
not
have
be
as
wise
as
they
be
:
and
those
who
have
be
delude
be
certain
to
find
excuse
and
reason
for
themselves
,
of
which
they
be
equally
certain
to
see
that
other
sufferer
be
wholly
devoid
:
not
to
mention
the
great
probability
of
every
individual
sufferer
persuade
himself
,
to
his
violent
indignation
,
that
<EOS>
but
for
the
example
of
all
the
other
sufferer
he
never
would
have
put
himself
in
the
way
of
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
because
such
a
declaration
as
Clennam
's
,
make
at
such
a
time
,
would
certainly
draw
down
upon
him
a
storm
of
animosity
,
render
it
impossible
to
calculate
on
forbearance
in
the
creditor
,
or
on
unanimity
among
them
;
and
expose
him
a
solitary
target
to
a
straggle
cross
-
fire
,
which
may
bring
him
down
from
half
-
a
-
dozen
quarter
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
to
all
this
Clennam
merely
reply
that
,
grant
the
whole
protest
,
nothing
in
it
lessen
the
force
,
or
could
lessen
the
force
,
of
the
voluntary
and
public
exoneration
of
his
partner
.
 
<EOS>
He
therefore
,
once
and
for
all
,
request
Mr
Rugg
's
immediate
aid
in
get
the
business
despatch
.
 
<EOS>
upon
that
,
Mr
Rugg
fall
to
work
;
and
Arthur
,
retain
no
property
to
himself
but

,
and
a
little
loose
money
,
place
his
small
private

<EOS>
thousand
of
people
be
wildly

about

somebody
alive

this
notable

set

down
on
it
with
a
pale
face
,
hold
the
arm
,
and
shake
his
head
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
if
he
have
deal
Clennam
a
heavy
blow
,
instead
of
lay
that
light
touch
upon
him
,
its
effect
could
not
have
be
to
shake
him
more

<EOS>
He
stand
amazed
;
his
eye
look
at
John
;
his
lip
part
,
and
seem
now
and
then
to
form
the
word
"
Me
!

<EOS>
without
utter
it
;
his
hand
drop
at
his
side

his
whole
appearance
that
of
a
man
who
have
be
awaken
from
sleep
,

stupefy
by
intelligence
beyond
his
full
comprehension

Mr

do
not

me
so

take
out
my

I
do
not

<EOS>
still
highly

enough
upon

Young
John
take
out
his
pocket

handkerchief
with
a
genuine
absence
both
of

concealment

in

his

have
dry
them

indulge
in
the
harmless
luxury
of
a
sob

a
sniff

put

up
again

the
touch
be
still
in
its
influence
so
like
a
blow
that
Arthur
could
not
get
many
word

<EOS>
He
assure
John
Chivery
when

have
return
his
handkerchief
to
his
pocket

that
he
do
all
honour
to
his
disinterestedness

to
the
fidelity

as
to
the
impression
on

of
which
he
have
just
relieve
it
---
here
John
interpose
,
and
say
,
"
no
impression

Certainty
!

"
---
as
to
that
,
they
may
perhaps
speak

it
at
another
time

would
say
no
more
now

<EOS>
feel
low
-
spirited
and
weary
,
he
would
go
back
to
his
room
,
with
john

leave

come
out
no
more

night

John
assent
,

he
creep
back
in

the

Little
Dorrit
love
him
!
 
<EOS>
More
bewildering
to
him
than
his
misery
,
far
.
   
<EOS>
consider
the
improbability
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
accustomed
to
call
her
his
child
,
and
his
dear
child
,
and
to
invite
her
confidence
by
dwell
upon
the
difference
in
their
respective
age
,
and
to
speak
of
himself
as
one
who
be
turn
old
.
 
<EOS>
yet
she
may
not
have
think
him
old

something
remind
him
that
he
have
not
think
himself
so
,
until
the
rose
have
float
away
upon
the
river

<EOS>
He
have
her
two
letter
among
other
paper
in
his
box
,
and
he
take
them
out
and
read
them
.
 
<EOS>
there
seem
to
be
a
sound
in
them
like
the
sound
of
her
sweet
voice
.
 
<EOS>
It
fall
upon
his
ear
with
many
tone
of
tenderness
,
that
be
not
insusceptible
of
the
new
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
now
it
be
that
the
quiet
desolation
of
her
answer
,
"
no
,
no
,
no
,
"
make
to
him
that
night
in
that
very
room
---
that
night
when
he
have
be
show
the
dawn
of
her
altered
fortune
,
and
when
other
word
have
pass
between
them
which
he
have
be
destine
to
remember
in
humiliation
and
a
prisoner
,
rush
into
his
mind
.
   
<EOS>
consider
the
improbability
.
   
<EOS>
but
it
have
a
preponderate
tendency
,
when
consider
,
to
become
fainter
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
another
and
a
curious
inquiry
of
his
own
heart
be
that
concurrently
become
strong
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
reluctance
he
have
feel
to
believe
that
she
love
any
one
;
in
his
desire
to
set
that
question
at
rest
;
in
a
half
-
form
consciousness
he
have
have
that
there
would
be
a
kind
of
nobleness
in
his
help
her
love
for
any
one
,
be
there
no
suppress
something
on
his
own
side
that
he
have
hush
as
it
arise
?
 
<EOS>
had
he
ever
whisper
to
himself
that
he
must
not
think
of
such
a
thing
as
her
love
him
,
that
he
must
not
take
advantage
of
her
gratitude
,
that
he
must
keep
his
experience
in
remembrance
as
a
warning
and
reproof
;
that
he
must
regard
such
youthful
hope
as
have
pass
away
,
as
his
friend
's
dead
daughter
have
pass
away
;
that
he
must
be
steady
in
say
to
himself
that
the
time
have
go
by
him
,
and
he
be
too
saddened
and
old
?
   
<EOS>
He
have
kiss
her
when
he
raise
her
from
the
ground
on
the
day
when
she
have
be
so
consistently
and
expressively
forget
.
<EOS>
quite
as
he
may
have
kiss
her
,
if
she
have
be
conscious
?
 
<EOS>
no
difference
?
   
<EOS>
the
darkness
find
him
occupy
with
these
thought
.
 
<EOS>
the
darkness
also
find
Mr
and
Mrs
Plornish
knock
at
his
door
.
 
<EOS>
They
bring
with
them
a
basket
,
fill
with
choice
selection
from

stock

meet
with
such
a
quick

produce
such
a
slow
return

<EOS>
Mrs
Plornish

Mr

in
his
philosophical

not
lucid
manner

that
there
be
up

It
be
in

It

It

out

out

out

Mr

his

now
leave
Mr

the

<EOS>
He
ought
to
be
much
comfort
by
the
reflection

work
themselves
out

<EOS>

the

prison
gate
bear
hard
on
Clennam
as
time
go
on
,
and
he
make
no
friend
among
the
community
within
.
 
<EOS>
too
depressed
to
associate
with
the
herd
in
the
yard
,
who
get
together
to
forget
their
care
;
too
retire
and
too
unhappy
to
join
in
the
poor
sociality
of
the
tavern
;
he
keep
his
own
room
,
and
be
hold
in
distrust
.
 
<EOS>
some
say
he
be
proud
;
some
object
that
he
be
sullen
and
reserve
;
some
be
contemptuous
of
him
,
for
that
he
be
a
poor
-
spirited
dog
who
pine
under
his
debt
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
population
be
shy
of
him
on
these
various
count
of
indictment
,
but
especially
the
last
,
which
involve
a
species
of
domestic
treason
;
and
he
soon
become
so
confirm
in
his
seclusion
,
that
his
only
time
for
walk
up
and
down
be
when
the
evening
Club
be
assemble
at
their
song
and
toast
and
sentiment
,

when

be
nearly
leave

begin

tell
upon
him

He
know
that

idle

after
what
he
have
know
of
the
influence
of
imprisonment
within
the
four
small
wall
of
the
very
room
he
occupy
,
this
consciousness
make
him
afraid
of
himself
.
 
<EOS>
shrink
from
the
observation
of
other
man
,
and
shrink
from
his
own
,
he
begin
to
change
very
sensibly
.
 
<EOS>
anybody
may
see
that
the
shadow
of
the
wall
be
dark
upon
him

<EOS>
one
day
when
he
may
have
be
some
ten

twelve

in

when

be
try
to

have
not

to
release
even

imaginary
people
of
the
book
from
the
Marshalsea

a
footstep
stop
at
his
door
,
and
a
hand
tap
at
it

<EOS>
He
arise
and
open
it
,
and
an
agreeable
voice
accost
him
with
"
how

Mr

I
hope

He
look
very
good

natured

prepossess

though
overpoweringly
gay
and
free
,
in
contrast
with
the
squalid
prison
.
   
<EOS>
"
You

excessively
sorry

"
I
be
very
happy
to

<EOS>
I
be
rather
afraid
in
my
own
mind
that
we
may
have
help
to
floor
you
,
because
there
be
no

that
it

our
misfortune

do

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
without

the

inoffensive

possible

You
will
say
we
be
a

I
will
not

all

You

It

be
the
essential

<EOS>
regard
our

from

that
we
only
ask

we
be

capital

be
your

there
to
be

"
ask
Clennam

<EOS>
"
You
exactly
hit
it
,
"
return
Ferdinand

<EOS>
"
It
be
there
with
the
express
intention

be
leave

<EOS>
that

<EOS>
no

there
be
a

it

else

it
be
only
a

<EOS>
why
,
good
Heaven
,
we
be
nothing

form

<EOS>
think
what
a

you
have

you

never

look
at

there
you
have
us

official

effectual

<EOS>
It
be
like
a
limited
game
of
cricket

of

<EOS>
Clennam
ask
what
become
of
the
bowler
?
 
<EOS>
the
airy
young
Barnacle
reply
that
they
grow
tired
,
get
dead
beat
,
get
lamed
,
get
their
back
break
,
die
off
,
give
it
up

go
in
for

game

"
<EOS>
and
this
occasion
me
to
congratulate
myself
again

,
"
he
pursue
,
"
on
the
circumstance
that
our
place
have
have
nothing
to
do
with
your
temporary
retirement
.
 
<EOS>
It
very
easily
may
have
have
a
hand
in
it
;
because
it
be
undeniable
that
we
be
sometimes
a
most
unlucky
place
,
in
our
effect
upon
people
who
will
not
leave
us
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Clennam
,
I
be
quite
unreserved
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
as
between
yourself
and
myself
,
I
know
I
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
,
when
I
first
see
you
make
the
mistake
of
not
leave
us
alone
;
because
I
perceive
that
you
be
inexperienced
and
sanguine
,
and
have
<EOS>
---
I
hope
you
will
not
object
to
my
saying

some
simplicity

<EOS>
"
not
at
all

"
   
<EOS>
"
some
simplicity

<EOS>
therefore
I
feel
what
a
pity
it
be
,
and
I
go
out
of
my
way
to
hint
to
you
(
<EOS>
which
really
be
not
official
,
but
I
never
be
official
when
I
can
help
it

<EOS>
something
to
the
effect
that
if
I
be
you
,
I
would
not
bother
myself

<EOS>
however

you
do
bother

now

I

confiding

sprightly
young
Barnacle

pleasantest
manner

Mr

like
a
housekeeper

enjoyment

enjoyment
of

enjoyment

as

know

so
errant
have
the

already
grow

solitude

dejection

Clennam
have

shake
off
a
kind

stupor

Mr

without

really

the
glorious
liberty

of

up

<EOS>
next
morning
,
Clennam
feel
that
his
health
be
sink
,
as
his
spirit
have
already
sink
and
that
the
weight
under
which
he
bend
be
bear
him
down
.
   
<EOS>
night
after
night
he
have
rise
from
his
bed
of
wretchedness
at
twelve
or
one
o'clock
,
and
have
sit
at
his
window
watch
the
sickly
lamp
in
the
yard
,
and
look
upward
for
the
first
wan
trace
of
day
,
hour
before
it
be
possible
that
the
sky
could
show
it
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
now
when
the
night
come
,
he
could
not
even
persuade
himself
to
undress
.
   
<EOS>
for
a
burn
restlessness
set
in
,
an
agonised
impatience
of
the
prison
,
and
a
conviction
that
he
be
go
to
break
his
heart
and
die
there
,
which
cause
him
indescribable
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
His
dread
and
hatred
of
the
place
become
so
intense
that
he
feel
it
a
labour
to
draw
his
breath
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
sensation
of
be
stifle
sometimes
so
overpower
him
,
that
he
would
stand
at
the
window
hold
his
throat
and
gasping
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
a
longing
for
other
air
,
and
a
yearning
to
be
beyond
the
blind
blank
wall
,
make
him
feel
as
if
he
must
go
mad
with
the
ardour
of
the
desire
.
   
<EOS>
many
other
prisoner
have
have
experience
of
this
condition
before
him
,
and
its
violence
and
continuity
have
wear
themselves
out
in

case
,
as
they
do
in
his

<EOS>
two

a

exhaust
it

<EOS>
It
come
back
by
fit
,
but
those
grow
fainter
and
return
at
lengthen
interval
.
 
<EOS>
a
desolate
calm
succeed
;
and
the
middle
of
the
week
find
him
settle
down
in
the
despondency
of
low
,
slow
fever
.
   
<EOS>
with
Cavalletto
and
Pancks
<EOS>
away
,
he
have
no
visitor
to
fear
<EOS>
but
Mr
and
Mrs
Plornish
.
 
<EOS>
His
anxiety
,
in
reference
to
that
worthy
pair
,
be
that
they
should
not
come
near
him
;
for
,
in
the
morbid
state
of
his
nerve
,
he
seek
to
be
leave
alone
,
and
spare
the
being
see
so
subdued
and
weak
.
 
<EOS>
He
write
a
note
to
Mrs
Plornish
represent
himself
as
occupy
with
his
affair
,
and
bind
by
the
necessity
of

himself
to
them

to
remain
for
a
time
even
without
the
pleasant
interruption
of
a
sight
of
her
kind
face

<EOS>
as
to
Young

who
look
in
daily
at
a
certain
hour
,
when
the
turnkey
be
relieve

to
ask
if
he
could
do
anything
for
him
;
he
always
make
a
pretence
of
be
engage
in
writing
,
and
to
answer
cheerfully
in
the
negative
.
 
<EOS>
the
subject
of
their
only
long
conversation
have
never
be
revive

<EOS>
through
all
these

however

it

<EOS>
It
seem
as
though
the
prison
's
poverty
,
and
shabbiness
,
and
dirt
,
be
grow
in
the
sultry
atmosphere
.
 
<EOS>
with
an
ache
head
and
a
weary
heart
,
Clennam
have
watch
the
miserable
night
out
,
listen
to
the
fall
of
rain
on
the
yard
pavement
,
think
of
its
soft
fall
upon
the
country
earth
.
 
<EOS>
a
blurred
circle
of
yellow
haze
have
rise
up
in
the
sky
in
lieu
of
sun
,
and
he
have
watch
the
patch
it
put
upon
his
wall
,
like
a
bit
of
the
prison
's
raggedness
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
hear
the
gate
open
;
and
the
badly
shod
foot
that
wait
outside
shuffle
in
;
and
the
sweeping
,
and
pump
,
and
move
about
,
begin
,
which
commence
the
prison
morning
.
 
<EOS>
so
ill
and
faint
that
he
be
oblige
to
rest
many
time
in
the
process
of
get
himself
wash
,
he
have
at
length
creep
to
his
chair
by
the
open
window
.
 
<EOS>
in
it
he
sit
doze
,
while
the
old
woman
who
arrange
his
room
go
through
her
morning
's
work
.
   
<EOS>
light
of
head
with
want
of
sleep
and
want
of
food
(
his
appetite
,
and
even
his
sense
of
taste
,
have
forsake
him
)
<EOS>
,
he
have
be
two
or
three
time
conscious
,
in
the
night
,
of
go
astray
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
hear
fragment
of
tune
and
song
in
the
warm
wind
,
which
he
know
have
no
existence
.
 
<EOS>
now
that
he
begin
to
doze
in
exhaustion
,
he
hear
them
again
;
and
voice
seem
to
address
him
,
and
he
answer
,
and
start
.
   
<EOS>
dozing
and
dream
,
without
the
power
of
reckon
time
,
so
that
a
minute
may
have
be
an
hour
and
an
hour
<EOS>
a
minute
,
some
abide
impression
of
a
garden
stole
over
him
---
a
garden
of
flower
,
with
a
damp
warm
wind
gently
stir
their
scent
.
 
<EOS>
It
require
such
a
painful
effort
to
lift
his
head
for
the
purpose
of
inquire
into
this
,
or
inquire
into
anything
,
that
the
impression
appear
to
have
become
quite
an
old
and
importunate
one
when
he
look
round
.
<EOS>
beside
the
tea
-
cup
on
his
table
he
see
,
then
,
a
blooming
nosegay
:
a
wonderful
handful
of
the
choice
and
most
lovely
flower
.
   
<EOS>
nothing
have
ever
appear
so
beautiful
in
his
sight
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
them
up
and
inhale
their
fragrance
,
and
he
lift
them
to
his
hot
head
,
and
he
put
them
down
and
open
his
parched
hand
to
them
,
as
cold
hand
be
open
to
receive
the
cheering
of
a
fire
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
he
have
delight
in
them
for
some
time
,
that
he
wonder
who
have
send
them
;
and
open
his
door
to
ask
the
woman
who
must
have
put
them
there
,
how
they
have
come
into
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
go
,
and
seem
to
have
be
long
go
;
for
the
tea
she
have
leave
for
him
on
the
table
be
cold
.
 
<EOS>
He
try
to
drink
some
,
but
could
not
bear
the
odour
of
it
:
so
he
creep
back
to
his
chair
by
the
open
window
,
and
put
the
flower
on
the
little
round
table
of
old
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
first
faintness
consequent
on
have
move
about

leave
him
,
he
subside
into
his
former
state
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
the
night

play
in
the
wind
,
when
the
door
of
his
room
seem
to
open
to
a
light
touch
,
and
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
a
quiet
figure
seem
to
stand
there
,
with
a
black
mantle
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
draw
the
mantle
off
and
drop
it
on
the
ground
,
and
then
it
seem
to
be
his
little
Dorrit
in
her
old
,
worn
dress
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
tremble
,
and
to
clasp
its
hand

and
to
smile
,
and
to
burst
into

He

because
I
do
not

I
have
be
tell

I

over

down

that
you
want

<EOS>
why
do
not
you
destroy

I
advise
you
to

no

it

You
must
keep

perhaps
you
may
carry

out

forsooth

just

you

rasp

the

I
admire
you
very

you

the

can
not

I
do

now

You

You

there

I

five

so

feel
a
little
out
of
temper

and
not
be
as
strict

,
I
take
a
look
at
the
document
before
twelve
o'clock
to
refresh
my
memory
as
to
its
appearance

fold
up
one
of
the
many
yellow
old
paper
in

afterwards
,
when

by

His

die
(
not

that
be
much

mine
may
have
die
instead
,
and
welcome

he
speculate
unsuccessfully
in
lunatic
,
he
get
into
difficulty
about
over

roast
a
patient
to
bring
him
to
reason

he
get
into

He

go
out

scrape
up

from

He
be
here
that
early
Monday
morning

wait
for
the
tide

in
short
,
he
be
go
to
Antwerp

where
(
I
be
afraid
you
will
be
shock
at
my
saying
,

be
damned
to
him

he
make
the
acquaintance
of
this
gentleman

He
have
come
a
long
way
,
and
,
I
think
then
,
be
only
sleepy
;

,
I
suppose
now
,
be
drunk

<EOS>
when
Arthur

have
be
under

she
have
be
always
write

incessantly
write

mostly
letter

My

have
hand
,
from
time

time
,
lot
of
these
sheet
to
me

<EOS>
I
think
I
may
as
well
keep
them
to
myself
as
have
them
swallow
up
alive
too
;
so
I
keep
them
in
a
box
,
look
over
them
when
I
feel
in
the
humour
.
 
<EOS>
convince
that
it
be
advisable
to
get
the
paper
out
of
the
place
,
with
Arthur
come
about
it
<EOS>
,
I
put
it
into
this
same
box
,
and
I
lock
the
whole
up
with
two
lock
,
and
I
trust
it
to
my
brother
to
take
away
and
keep
,
till
I
should
write
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
write
about
it
,
and
never
get
an
answer

<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
,
till
this
gentleman
favour
us
with
his
first
visit
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
,
I
begin
to
suspect
how
it
be
,
then
;
and
I
do
not
want
his
word
for
it
now
to
understand
how
he
get
his
knowledge
from
my
paper
,
and
your
paper
,
and
my
brother

cognac
and
tobacco
talk
<EOS>
(
I
wish
he
would
have
to
gag
himself

<EOS>
now
,
I
have
only
one
thing
more
to
say
,
you
hammer
-
head
woman
,
and
that
is
,
that
I
have
not
altogether
make
up
my
mind
whether
I
may
,
or
may
not
,
have
ever
give
you
any
trouble
about
the
codicil
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
not
;
and
that
I
should
have
be
quite
satisfied
with
know
I
have
get
the
well
of
you
,
and
that
I
hold
the
power
over
you
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
present
state
of
circumstance
,
I
have
no
more
explanation
to
give
you
till
this
time
to

morrow
night

<EOS>
so
you
may
as
well

"
say
Mr

terminate
his

she

affery

She
come
up

in

to

carry
her
into

neighbouring

to
be
faithful
to
her

<EOS>
the
mystery

noise
be
out
now

affery

like
great
people

have
always
be
right
in

always
wrong
in
the

she
deduce

<EOS>
when
the
storm
of
dust
have
clear
away
and
the
summer
night
be
calm
again
,
number
of
people
choke
up
every
avenue
of
access
,
and
party
of
digger
be
form
to
relieve
one
another
in
dig
among
the
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
hundred
people
in
the
house
at
the
time
of
its
fall
,
there
have
be
fifty
,
there
have
be
fifteen
,
there
have
be
two
.
 
<EOS>
Rumour
finally
settle
the
number
at
two
;
the
foreigner
and
Mr
Flintwinch
.
<EOS>
the
digger
dig
all
through
the
short
night
by
flare
pipe
of
gas
,
and
on
a
level
with
the
early
sun
,
and
deep
and
deep
below
it
as
it
rise
into
its
zenith
,
and
aslant
of
it
as
it
decline
,
and
on
a
level
with
it
again
as
it
depart
.
 
<EOS>
sturdy
dig
,
and
shovel
,
and
carry
away
,
in
cart
,
barrow
,
and
basket
,
go
on
without
intermission
,
by
night
and
by
day
;
but
it
be
night
for
the
second
time
when
they
find
the
dirty
heap
of
rubbish
that
have
be
the
foreigner
before
his
head
have
be
shiver
to
atom
,
like
so
much
glass
,
by
the
great
beam
that
lie
upon
him
,
crush
him
.
   
<EOS>
still
,
they
have
not
come
upon
Flintwinch
yet
;
so
the
sturdy
digging
and
shovel
and
carry
away
go
on
without
intermission
by
night
and
by
day
.
 
<EOS>
It
get
about
that
the
old
house
have
have
famous
cellarage
(
which
indeed
be
true
)
,
and
that
Flintwinch
have
be
in
a
cellar
at
the
moment
,
or
have
have
time
to
escape
into
one
,
and
that
he
be
safe
under
its
strong
arch
,
and
even
that
he
have
be
hear
to
cry
,
in
hollow
,
subterranean
,
suffocated
note
,
"
here
I
be
!
"
 
<EOS>
at
the
opposite
extremity
of
the
town
it
be
even
know
that
the
excavator
have
be
able
to
open
a
communication
with
him
through
a
pipe
,
and
that
he
have
receive
both
soup
and
brandy
by
that
channel
,
and
that
he
have
say
with
admirable
fortitude
that
he
be
all
right
,
my
lad
,
with
the
exception
of
his
collar
-
bone
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
digging
and
shovel
and
carry
away
go
on
without
intermission
,
until
the
ruin
be
all
dig
out
,
and
the
cellar
open
to
the
light
;
and
still
no
Flintwinch
,
living
or
dead
,
all
right
or
all
wrong
,
have
be
turn
up
by
pick
or
spade
.
   
<EOS>
It
begin
then
to
be
perceive
that
Flintwinch
have
not
be
there
at
the
time
of
the
fall
;
and
it
begin
then
to
be
perceive
that
he
have
be
rather
busy
elsewhere
,
convert
security
into
as
much
money
as
could
be
get
for
them
on
the
short
notice
,
and
turn
to
his
own
exclusive
account
his
authority
to
act
for
the
Firm
.
<EOS>
affery
,
remember
that
the
clever
one
have
say
he
would
explain
himself
further
in
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
'
time
,
determine
for
her
part
that
his
take
himself
off
within
that
period
with
all
he
could
get
,
be
the
final
satisfactory
sum
and
substance
of
his
promise
explanation
;
but
she
hold
her
peace
,
devoutly
thankful
to
be
quit
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
seem
reasonable
to
conclude
that
a
man
who
have
never
be
bury
could
not
be
unburied
,
the
digger
give
him
up
when
their
task
be
do
,
and
do
not
dig
down
for
him
into
the
depth
of
the
earth
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
take
in
ill
part
by
a
great
many
people

who
persist
in
believe
that
Flintwinch
be
lie
somewhere
among

London

nor
be
their
belief
much
shake
by

here
be
poor
Mr

not

the
opinion
that
they
could
do
no
better
than
agree
that
they
be
both
remarkably
fine
woman

that
there

<EOS>
of
which
remarkable
gentlewoman
it
may
be
finally
observe
,
that
there
surely
never
be
a
gentlewoman
of
whose
transcendent
fitness
for
any
vacant
appointment
on
the
face
of
this
earth
,
so
many
people
be
(
as
the
warmth
of
her
testimonial
evince

so
perfectly
satisfied

or
who
be
so
very
unfortunate
in
have
a
large
circle
of
ardent
and
distinguished
admirer
,
who
never
themselves
happen
to
want
her
in
any
capacity

<EOS>
on
the
first
crash
of
the
eminent
Mr
Merdle

decease
,
many
important
person
have
be
unable
to
determine
whether
they
should
cut
Mrs
Merdle
,
or
comfort
her
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
seem
,
however
,
essential
to
the
strength
of
their
own
case
that
they
should
admit
her

cruelly
deceive
,
they
graciously
make
the
admission
,
and
continue
to
know
her

<EOS>
It
follow
that
Mrs
Merdle
,
as
a
woman
of
fashion
and
good
breeding
who
have
be
sacrifice

the
wile
of
a

<EOS>
She
return
this
fealty

to
be
understand
that
she
be
even
more
incensed
against
the
felonious
shade
of

thus

on

she
come

into

Fanny

would
be

depend
on
the
repose
into
which
his

could
be

Little
Dorrit
's
sole
reliance
during
this
heavy
period
be
on
Mr
Meagles
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
still
abroad
;
but
she
have
write
to
him
through
his
daughter
,
immediately
after
first
see
Arthur
in
the
Marshalsea
and
since
,
confide
her
uneasiness
to
him
on
the
point
on
which
she
be
most
anxious
,
but
especially
on
one
.
 
<EOS>
to
that
one
,
the
continue
absence
of
Mr
Meagles
abroad
,
instead
of
his
comfort
presence

the
Marshalsea

be
referable
.
   
<EOS>
without
disclose
the
precise
nature
of
the
document
that
have
fall
into
Rigaud

hand
,
Little
Dorrit
have
confide
the
general
outline
of
that
story
to
Mr
Meagles
,
to
whom
she
have
also
recount
his
fate
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
cautious
habit
of
the
scale
and
scoop
at
once
show
Mr
Meagles
the
importance
of
recover
the
original
paper
;
wherefore
he
write
back
to
Little
Dorrit
,
strongly
confirm
her
in
the
solicitude
she
express
on
that
head
,
and
add
that
he
would
not
come
over
to
England
"
without
make
some
attempt
to
trace
them
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
by
this
time
Mr
Henry
Gowan
have
make
up
his
mind
that
it
would
be
agreeable
to
him
not
to
know
the
Meagleses
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
so
considerate
as
to
lay
no
injunction
on
his
wife
in
that
particular
;
but
he
mention
to
Mr
Meagles
that
personally
they
do
not
appear
to
him
to
get
on
together
,
and
that
he
think
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
---
politely
,
and
without
any
scene
,
or
anything
of
that
sort
---
they
agree
that
they
be
the
good
fellow
in
the
world
,
but
be
best
apart
.

Poor
Mr
Meagles
,
who
be
already
sensible
that
he

his

constantly
slight
in

"
Good

You

me

<EOS>
this
arrangement
involve
the
contingent
advantage
,
which
perhaps
Henry
Gowan
have
not
foresee
,
that
both
Mr
and
Mrs
Meagles
be
more
liberal
than
before
to
their
daughter
,
when
their
communication
be
only
with
her
and
her
young
child
:
and
that
his
high
spirit
find
itself
better
provide
with
money
,
without
be
under
the
degrade
necessity
of
know
whence
it
come

<EOS>
Mr
Meagles
,
at
such
a
period
,
naturally
seize
an
occupation
with
great
ardour
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
from
his
daughter
the
various
town
which
Rigaud
have
be
haunt
,
and
the
various
hotel
at
which
he
have
be
live
for
some
time
back
.
 
<EOS>
the
occupation
he
set
himself
be
to
visit
these
with
all
discretion
and
speed
,
and
,
in
the
event
of
find
anywhere
that
he
have
leave
a
bill
unpaid
,
and
a
box
or
parcel
behind
,
to
pay
such
bill
,
and
bring
away
such
box
or
parcel
.
   
<EOS>
with
no
other
attendant
than
Mother
,
Mr
Meagles
go
upon
his
pilgrimage
,
and
encounter
a
number
of
adventure
.
 
<EOS>
not
the
least
of
his
difficulty
be
,
that
he
never
know

that
he
pursue
his
inquiry
among
people
who
never
know
what
he
say
to

<EOS>
still
,
with
an
unshaken
confidence
that
the

be
somehow
the

tongue
of
the

only
the
people
be
too
stupid

know
it

Mr
Meagles
harangue
innkeeper
in
the
most
voluble
manner
,
enter
into
loud
explanation
of
the
most
complicated
sort
,
and
utterly
renounce
reply
in
the
native
language
of
the
respondent
,
on
the
ground
that
they
be
"
all
bosh

"
 
<EOS>
sometimes
interpreter
be
call
in

whom
Mr
Meagles
address
in
such
idiomatic
term
of
speech
,
as
instantly
to
extinguish
and
shut
up
---
which
make
the
matter
bad
.
<EOS>
on
a
balance
of
the
account
,
however
,
it
may
be
doubt
whether
he
lose
much
;
for
,
although
he
find
no
property
,
he
find
so
many
debt
and
various
association
of
discredit
with
the
proper
name
,
which
be
the
only
word
he
make
intelligible
,
that
he
be
almost
everywhere
overwhelmed
with
injurious
accusation
.
 
<EOS>
on
no
few
than
four
occasion
the
police
be
call
in
to
receive
denunciation
of
Mr

as
a
Knight
of
Industry
,
a
good

for

nothing

and
a
thief

all
of
which
opprobrious
language
he
bear
with
the
good

have
no
idea
what
it

be
in
the
most
ignominious
manner
escort
to
steam

public
carriage

to
be
get
rid

in

Mr

shrewd

when
he

I
be

do

there
be
reason

why
he
should
wish

be

I
get
into

state

that
people
be
all
against

the
bad
fault
I
find
in

make
it
out

triumph

the
Marshal

official
residence

have
be
for
the
two
or
three
hour
in

a
great
boon
to
the
young
inhabitant
of
the
Borough

whose
sally

<EOS>
one
last
remark
I
may
wish
to
make
one
last
explanation
I
may
wish
to
offer
perhaps
<EOS>
your
good
nature
may
excuse
under
pretence
of
three
kidney

the
humble
place
of

put
herself
in
the
way
of
be
run
over

with
a
perseverance
worthy
of
a
well
cause
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
"
three
kidney
one
,
"
which
be
to
be
a
blind
to
the
conversation
,
be
set
before
them
on
three
little
tin
platter
,
each
kidney
one
ornament
with
a
hole
at
the
top

excuse
me

to
freedom
even
a
pie
as
far
from
flaky
as
the
present
and
so
deficient
in
kidney
as
to
be
in
that
respect
like
a

not

unacceptable

in
contemplation
beg
to
state
that
I

find
no
fault
with
either

it
may
be
wither
to
know
that
ere
the

of
Time
have
make
me
much
less
slim
than
formerly
and
dreadfully
red
on
the
slight
exertion

after
eat
<EOS>

well
know
when

the
form

a
rash
,

have
be

the
interruption

parent
and
mental
torpor

until
the
mysterious
clue
be

by
Mr

I
would
not

ungenerous
to
either

it

that
I
do
trust
for
the
sake
of
old
time

old
sincerity
that
Arthur
will
know
that
I
do
not
desert
him
in
his
misfortune

that
I
come
backwards
and
forwards
constantly
to
ask
if
I
could
do
anything
for
him
and
that
I
sit
in
the
pie

shop
where
they
very
civilly
fetch
something
warm
in
a
tumbler
from
the
hotel

"
I

the
bad

<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
I
should

of
it

Arthur

if

my
plain
answer

---
here

catch
Arthur
by

<EOS>
"
there

only
three
branch
of
my

my
dear
Clennam

say
Doyce
,
proceed
to
mould
them
severally
,
with
his
plastic
thumb
,
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
,
"
and
they
be
soon
dispose
of
.
<EOS>
first
,
not
a
word
more
from
you
about
the
past
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
error
in
your
calculation
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
that
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
affect
the
whole
machine
,
and
failure
be
the
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
profit
by
the
failure
,
and
will
avoid
it
another
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
do
a
similar
thing
myself
,
in
construction
,
often
.
 
<EOS>
every
failure
teach
a
man
something
,
if
he
will
learn
;
and
you
be
too
sensible
a
man
not
to
learn
from
this
failure
.
 
<EOS>
so
much
for
firstly
.
 
<EOS>
secondly
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
you
should
have
take
it
so
heavily
to
heart
,
and
reproach
yourself
so
severely
;
I
be
travel
home
night
and
day
to
put
matter
right
,
with
the
assistance
of
our
friend
,
when
I
fall
in
with
our
friend
as
he
have
inform
you
.
 
<EOS>
thirdly
.
 
<EOS>
We
two
agree
,
that
,
after
what
you
have
undergo
,
after
your
distress
of
mind
,
and
after
your
illness
,
it
would
be
a
pleasant
surprise
if
we
could
so
far
keep
quiet
as
to
get
thing
perfectly
arrange
without
your
knowledge
,
and
then
come
and
say
that
all
the
affair
be
smooth
,
that
everything
be
right
,
that
the
business
stand
in
great
want
of
you
than
ever
it
do
,
and
that
a
new
and
prosperous
career
be
open
before
you
and
me
as
partner
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
thirdly
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
know
we
always
make
an
allowance
for
friction
,
and
<EOS>
so
I
have
reserve
space
to
close
in
.
 
<EOS>
My

Clennam
,
I
thoroughly
confide
in
you
;
you
have
it
in
your

until
Arthur
have
stand
for
some
time
at

<EOS>
"
I
make
a
remark
a
little
while
ago

"
say
Daniel
Doyce
then
,

which
I
be
inclined
to
think
be
an
incorrect
one

<EOS>
I
say
there
be
nothing
to

you
here
,
Clennam
,
half
an

do
me
the
honour

twenty
hour
in

little

<EOS>
and
he
go
out
together
soon
afterwards
,
and
Mr

linger
behind
to
say
a
word
to
his

<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Arthur
,
you
will
not
want
Mother

me
in
the
morning

we
will
keep
away

<EOS>
It
may
set
Mother
think
about
Pet

she
be
a
soft

hearted
woman

<EOS>
She
be
good
at
the
Cottage

I
will

to
kiss
him
,
"
if
you
will
only
humour
me
when

<EOS>
so
they
stand
before

,
wait
:

with
his

and

ask

You

answer
Little

<EOS>
They
pass
very
quietly
along

for
no

be
there
,
though
many

<EOS>
only

<EOS>
when
