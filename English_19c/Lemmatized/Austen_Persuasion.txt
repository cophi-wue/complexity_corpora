vanity
be
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
Sir
Walter
Elliot
's
character
;
vanity
of
person
and
of
situation
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
remarkably
handsome
in
his
youth
;
and
,
at
fifty
-
four
,
be
still
a
very
fine
man

<EOS>
few
woman
could
think
more
of
their
personal
appearance
than
he
do
,
nor
could
the
valet
of
any
new
make
lord
be
more
delighted
with
the
place
he
hold
in
society
.
<EOS>
He
consider
the
blessing
of
beauty
as
inferior
only
to
the
blessing
of
a
baronetcy
;
and
the
Sir
Walter
Elliot
,
who
unite
these
gift
,
be
the
constant
object
of
his
warm
respect
and
devotion
.
  
<EOS>
His
good
look
and
his
rank
have
one
fair
claim
on
his
attachment
;
since
to
them
he
must
have
owe
a
wife
of
very
superior
character
to
any
thing
deserve
by
his
own
.
<EOS>
Lady
Elliot
have
be
an
excellent
woman

sensible
and
amiable
;
whose
judgement
and
conduct
,
if
they
may
be
pardon
the
youthful
infatuation
which
make
her
Lady

,
have
never
require
indulgence
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
humour
,
or
soften
,
or
conceal
his
failing
,
and
promote
his
real
respectability
for
seventeen
year
;
and
though
not
the
very
happy
be
in
the
world
herself
,
have
find
enough
in
her
duty
,
her
friend
,
and
her
child
,
to
attach
her
to
life
,
and
make
it
no
matter
of
indifference
to
her

she
be

<EOS>
three
girl
,
the
two
eld
sixteen
and
fourteen

be
an
awful
legacy
for
a
mother
to
bequeath
,
an
awful
charge
rather
,
to
confide
to
the
authority
and
guidance
of
a
conceited
,
silly
father

<EOS>
She
have
,
however

one
very
intimate

woman

who
have
be
bring

by
strong
attachment
to
herself

to
settle
close
by
her

in
the
village
of
Kellynch

on
her
kindness
and
advice

rely
for
the
good

of
the
good
principle
and

and
Sir

do
not

whatever
may
have
be

on
that
head

their
acquaintance

<EOS>
thirteen
year
have
pass
away
since
Lady
Elliot
's
death
,
and
they
be
still
near
neighbour
and
intimate
friend
,
and
one
remain
a
widower
,
the
other
a
widow
.
  
<EOS>
that
Lady
Russell
,
of
steady
age
and
character
,
and
extremely
well
provide
for
,
should
have
no
thought
of
a
second
marriage
,
need
no
apology
to
the
public
,
which
be
rather
apt
to
be
unreasonably
discontent
when
a
woman
do
marry
again
,
than
when
she
do
not
;
but
Sir
Walter
's
continue
in
singleness
require
explanation
.
<EOS>
be
it
known
then
,
that
Sir
Walter
,
like
a
good
father
,
(
have
meet
with
one
or
two
private
disappointment
in
very
unreasonable
application
)
,
pride
himself
on
remain
single
for
his
dear
daughter
'
sake
.
<EOS>
for
one
daughter
,
his
eld
,
he
would
really
have
give
up
any
thing
,
which
he
have
not
be
very
much
tempt
to
do
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
have
succeed
,
at
sixteen
,
to
all
that
be
possible
,
of
her
mother
's
right
and
consequence
;
and
be
very
handsome
,
and
very
like
himself
,
her
influence
have
always
be
great
,
and
they
have
go
on
together
most
happily
.
<EOS>
His
two
other
child
be
of
very
inferior
value
.
<EOS>
Mary
have
acquire
a
little
artificial
importance
,
by
become
Mrs
Charles
Musgrove
;
but
Anne
,
with
an
elegance
of
mind
and
sweetness
of
character
,
which
must
have
place
her
high
with
any
people
of
real
understanding
,
be
nobody
with
either
father
or
sister
;
her
word
have
no
weight
,
her
convenience
be
always
to
give
way
 
<EOS>
she
be
only
Anne

<EOS>
to
Lady
Russell
,
indeed
,
she
be
a
most
dear
and
highly
value
god
-
daughter
,
favourite
,
and
friend
.
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
love
them
all
;
but
it
be
only
in
Anne
that
she
could
fancy
the
mother
to
revive
again
.
  
<EOS>
a
few
year
before
,
Anne
Elliot
have
be
a
very
pretty
girl
,
but
her
bloom
have
vanish
early
;
and
as
even
in
its
height
,
her
father
have
find
little
to
admire
in
her
,
<EOS>
(
so
totally
different
be
her
delicate
feature
and
mild
dark
eye
from
his
own
)
<EOS>
,
there
could
be
nothing
in
them
,
now
that
she
be
fade
and
thin
,
to
excite
his
esteem
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
indulge
much
hope
,
he
have
now
<EOS>
none
,
of
ever
read
her
name
in
any
other
page
of
his
favourite
work
.
<EOS>
all
equality
of
alliance
must
rest
with
Elizabeth
,
for
Mary
have
merely
connect
herself
with
an
old
country
family
of
respectability
and
large
fortune
,
and
have
therefore
give
all
the
honour
and
receive
none
:
Elizabeth
would
,
one
day
or
other
,
marry
suitably
.
  
<EOS>
It
sometimes
happen
that
a
woman
be
handsome
at
twenty
-
nine
than
she
be
ten
year
before
;
and
,
generally
speak
,
<EOS>
if
there
have
be
neither
ill
health
nor
anxiety
,
it
be
a
time
of
life
at
which
scarcely
any
charm
be
lose
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
with
Elizabeth
,
still
the
same
handsome
Miss
Elliot
that
she
have
begin
to
be
thirteen
year
ago
,
and
Sir
Walter
may
be
excuse
,
therefore
,
in
forget
her
age
,
or
,
at
least
,
be
deem
only
half
a
fool
,
for
think
himself
and
Elizabeth
as
bloom
as
ever
,
amidst
the
wreck
of
the
good
look
of
everybody
else
;
for
he
could
plainly
see
how
old
all
the
rest
of
his
family
and
acquaintance
be
grow
.
<EOS>
Anne
haggard
,
Mary
coarse
,
every
face
in
the
neighbourhood
worsting
,
and
the
rapid
increase
of
the
crow
's
foot
about
Lady
Russell
's
temple
have
long
be
a
distress
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
do
not
quite
equal
her
father
in
personal
contentment
.
<EOS>
thirteen
year
have
see
her
mistress
of
Kellynch
Hall
,
preside
and
direct
with
a
self
-
possession
and
decision
which
could
never
have
give
the
idea
of
her
be
young
than
she
be
.
<EOS>
for
thirteen
year
have
she
be
do
the
honour
,
and
lay
down
the
domestic
law
at
home
,
and
lead
the
way
to
the
chaise
and
four
,
and
walk
immediately
after
Lady
Russell
out
of
all
the
drawing
-
room
and
dining
-
room
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
thirteen
winter
'
revolve
frost
have
see
her
opening
every
ball
of
credit
which
a
scanty
neighbourhood
afford
,
and
thirteen
spring
shew
their
blossom
,
as
she
travel
up
to
London
with
her
father
,
for
a
few
week
'
annual
enjoyment
of
the
great
world
.
<EOS>
She
have
the
remembrance
of
all
this
,
she
have
the
consciousness
of
be
nine
-
and
-
twenty
to
give
her
some
regret
and
some
apprehension
;
she
be
fully
satisfied
of
be
still
quite
as
handsome
as
ever
,
but
she
feel
her
approach
to
the
year
of
danger
,
and
would
have
rejoice
to
be
certain
of
be
properly
solicit
by
baronet
-
blood
within
the
next
twelvemonth
or
two
.
<EOS>
then
may
she
again
take
up
the
book
of
book
with
as
much
enjoyment
as
in
her
early
youth
,
but
now
she
like
it
not
.
<EOS>
always
to
be
present
with
the
date
of
her
own
birth
and
see
no
marriage
follow
but
that
of
a
young
sister
,
make
the
book
an
evil
;
and
more
than
once
,
when
her
father
have
leave
it
open
on
the
table
near
her
,
have
she
close
it
,
with
avert
eye
,
and
push
it
away
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
have
a
disappointment
,
moreover
,
which
that
book
,
and
especially
the
history
of
her
own
family
,
must
ever
present
the
remembrance
of
.
<EOS>
the
heir
presumptive
,
the
very
William
Walter
Elliot
,
Esq
.
,
whose
right
have
be
so
generously
support
by
her
father
,
have
disappoint
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
,
while
a
very
young
girl
,
as
soon
as
she
have
know
him
to
be
,
in
the
event
of
her
have
no
brother
,
the
future
baronet
,
mean
to
marry
him
,
and
her
father
have
always
mean
that
she
should
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
know
to
them
as
a
boy
;
but
soon
after
Lady
Elliot
's
death
,
Sir
Walter
have
seek
the
acquaintance
,
and
though
his
overture
have
not
be
meet
with
any
warmth
,
he
have
persevere
in
seek
it
,
make
allowance
for
the
modest
drawing
-
back
of
youth
;
and
,
in
one
of
their
spring
excursion
to
London
,
when
Elizabeth
be
in
her
first
bloom
,
Mr
Elliot
have
be
force
into
the
introduction
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
at
that
time
a
very
young
man
,
just
engage
in
the
study
of
the
law
;
and
Elizabeth
find
him
extremely
agreeable
,
and
every
plan
in
his
favour
be
confirm
.
<EOS>
He
be
invite
to
Kellynch
Hall
;
he
be
talk
of
and
expect
all
the
rest
of
the
year
;
but
he
never
come
.
<EOS>
the
follow
spring
he
be
see
again
in
town
,
find
equally
agreeable
,
again
encourage
,
invite
,
and
expect
,
and
again
he
do
not
come
;
and
the
next
tiding
be
that
he
be
married
.
<EOS>
instead
of
push
his
fortune
in
the
line
mark
out
for
the
heir
of
the
house
of
Elliot
,
he
have
purchase
independence
by
unite
himself
to
a
rich
woman
of
inferior
birth
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
have
resent
it
.
<EOS>
as
the
head
of
the
house
,
he
feel
that
he
ought
to
have
be
consult
,
especially
after
take
the
young
man
so
publicly
by
the
hand
;
"
for
they
must
have
be
see
together
,
"
he
observe
,
"
once
at
Tattersall
's
,
and
twice
in
the
lobby
of
the
House
of
Commons
.
"
<EOS>
His
disapprobation
be
express
,
but
apparently
very
little
regard
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
have
attempt
no
apology
,
and
shew
himself
as
unsolicitous
of
be
longer
notice
by
the
family
,
as
Sir
Walter
consider
him
unworthy
of
it
:
all
acquaintance
between
them
have
cease
.
  
<EOS>
this
very
awkward
history
of
Mr
Elliot
be
still
,
after
an
interval
of
several
year
,
feel
with
anger
by
Elizabeth
,
who
have
like
the
man
for
himself
,
and
still
more
for
be
her
father
's
heir
,
and
whose
strong
family
pride
could
see
only
in
him
a
proper
match
for
Sir
Walter
Elliot
's
eld
daughter
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
baronet
from
a
to
z
whom
her
feeling
could
have
so
willingly
acknowledge
as
an
equal
.
<EOS>
yet
so
miserably
have
he
conduct
himself
,
that
though
she
be
at
this
present
time
(
the
summer
of
1814
)
wear
black
ribbon
for
his
wife
,
she
could
not
admit
him
to
be
worth
think
of
again
.
<EOS>
the
disgrace
of
his
first
marriage
may
,
perhaps
,
as
there
be
no
reason
to
suppose
it
perpetuate
by
offspring
,
have
be
get
over
,
have
he
not
do
worse
;
but
he
have
,
as
by
the
accustomary
intervention
of
kind
friend
,
they
have
be
inform
,
speak
most
disrespectfully
of
them
all
,
most
slightingly
and
contemptuously
of
the
very
blood
he
belong
to
,
and
the
honour
which
be
hereafter
to
be
his
own
.
<EOS>
this
could
not
be
pardon
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
Elizabeth
Elliot
's
sentiment
and
sensation
;
such
the
care
to
alloy
,
the
agitation
to
vary
,
the
sameness
and
the
elegance
,
the
prosperity
and
the
nothingness
of
her
scene
of
life
;
such
the
feeling
to
give
interest
to
a
long
,
uneventful
residence
in
one
country
circle
,
to
fill
the
vacancy
which
there
be
no
habit
of
utility
abroad
,
no
talent
or
accomplishment
for
home
,
to
occupy
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
,
another
occupation
and
solicitude
of
mind
be
begin
to
be
add
to
these
.
<EOS>
Her
father
be
grow
distress
for
money
.
<EOS>
She
know
,
that
when
he
now
take
up
the
Baronetage
,
it
be
to
drive
the
heavy
bill
of
his
tradespeople
,
and
the
unwelcome
hint
of
Mr
Shepherd
,
his
agent
,
from
his
thought
.
<EOS>
the
Kellynch
property
be
good
,
but
not
equal
to
Sir
Walter
's
apprehension
of
the
state
require
in
its
possessor
.
<EOS>
while
Lady
Elliot
live
,
there
have
be
method
,
moderation
,
and
economy
,
which
have
just
keep
him
within
his
income
;
but
with
her
have
die
all
such
right
-
mindedness
,
and
from
that
period
he
have
be
constantly
exceed
it
.
<EOS>
It
have
not
be
possible
for
him
to
spend
less
;
he
have
do
nothing
but
what
Sir
Walter
Elliot
be
imperiously
call
on
to
do
;
but
blameless
as
he
be
,
he
be
not
only
grow
dreadfully
in
debt
,
but
be
hear
of
it
so
often
,
that
it
become
vain
to
attempt
conceal
it
longer
,
even
partially
,
from
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
He
have
give
her
some
hint
of
it
the
last
spring
in
town
;
he
have
go
so
far
even
as
to
say
,
"
Can
we
retrench
?
<EOS>
do
it
occur
to
you
that
there
be
any
one
article
in
which
we
can
retrench
?
"
<EOS>
and
Elizabeth
,
to
do
her
justice
,
have
,
in
the
first
ardour
of
female
alarm
,
set
seriously
to
think
what
could
be
do
,
and
have
finally
propose
these
two
branch
of
economy
,
to
cut
off
some
unnecessary
charity
,
and
to
refrain
from
new
furnish
the
drawing
-
room
;
to
which
expedient
she
afterwards
add
the
happy
thought
of
their
take
no
present
down
to
Anne
,
as
have
be
the
usual
yearly
custom
.
<EOS>
but
these
measure
,
however
good
in
themselves
,
be
insufficient
for
the
real
extent
of
the
evil
,
the
whole
of
which
Sir
Walter
find
himself
oblige
to
confess
to
her
soon
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
have
nothing
to
propose
of
deep
efficacy
.
<EOS>
She
feel
herself
ill
-
use
and
unfortunate
,
as
do
her
father
;
and
they
be
neither
of
them
able
to
devise
any
mean
of
lessen
their
expense
without
compromise
their
dignity
,
or
relinquish
their
comfort
in
a
way
not
to
be
bear
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
only
a
small
part
of
his
estate
that
Sir
Walter
could
dispose
of
;
but
have
every
acre
be
alienable
,
it
would
have
make
no
difference
.
<EOS>
He
have
condescend
to
mortgage
as
far
as
he
have
the
power
,
but
he
would
never
condescend
to
sell
.
<EOS>
no
;
he
would
never
disgrace
his
name
so
far
.
<EOS>
the
Kellynch
estate
should
be
transmit
whole
and
entire
,
as
he
have
receive
it
.
  
<EOS>
Their
two
confidential
friend
,
Mr
Shepherd
,
who
live
in
the
neighbour
market
town
,
and
Lady
Russell
,
be
call
to
advise
them
;
and
both
father
and
daughter
seem
to
expect
that
something
should
be
strike
out
by
one
or
the
other
to
remove
their
embarrassment
and
reduce
their
expenditure
,
without
involve
the
loss
of
any
indulgence
of
taste
or
pride
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Shepherd
,
a
civil
,
cautious
lawyer
,
who
,
whatever
may
be
his
hold
or
his
view
on
Sir
Walter
,
would
rather
have
the
disagreeable
prompt
by
anybody
else
,
excuse
himself
from
offer
the
slight
hint
,
and
only
beg
leave
to
recommend
an
implicit
reference
to
the
excellent
judgement
of
Lady
Russell
,
from
whose
know
good
sense
he
fully
expect
to
have
just
such
resolute
measure
advise
as
he
mean
to
see
finally
adopt
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
be
most
anxiously
zealous
on
the
subject
,
and
give
it
much
serious
consideration
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
woman
rather
of
sound
than
of
quick
ability
,
whose
difficulty
in
come
to
any
decision
in
this
instance
be
great
,
from
the
opposition
of
two
leading
principle
.
<EOS>
She
be
of
strict
integrity
herself
,
with
a
delicate
sense
of
honour
;
but
she
be
as
desirous
of
save
Sir
Walter
's
feeling
,
as
solicitous
for
the
credit
of
the
family
,
as
aristocratic
in
her
idea
of
what
be
due
to
them
,
as
anybody
of
sense
and
honesty
could
well
be
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
benevolent
,
charitable
,
good
woman
,
and
capable
of
strong
attachment
,
most
correct
in
her
conduct
,
strict
in
her
notion
of
decorum
,
and
with
manner
that
be
hold
a
standard
of
good
-
breeding
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
cultivate
mind
,
and
be
,
generally
speak
,
rational
and
consistent
;
but
she
have
prejudice
on
the
side
of
ancestry
;
she
have
a
value
for
rank
and
consequence
,
which
blind
her
a
little
to
the
fault
of
those
who
possess
them
.
<EOS>
Herself
the
widow
of
only
a
knight
,
she
give
the
dignity
of
a
baronet
all
its
due
;
and
Sir
Walter
,
independent
of
his
claim
as
an
old
acquaintance
,
an
attentive
neighbour
,
an
obliging
landlord
,
the
husband
of
her
very
dear
friend
,
the
father
of
Anne
and
her
sister
,
be
,
as
be
Sir
Walter
,
in
her
apprehension
,
entitle
to
a
great
deal
of
compassion
and
consideration
under
his
present
difficulty
.
  
<EOS>
They
must
retrench
;
that
do
not
admit
of
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
very
anxious
to
have
it
do
with
the
least
possible
pain
to
him
and
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
She
draw
up
plan
of
economy
,
she
make
exact
calculation
,
and
she
do
what
nobody
else
think
of
do
<EOS>
:
she
consult
Anne
,
who
never
seem
consider
by
the
other
as
have
any
interest
in
the
question
.
<EOS>
She
consult
,
and
in
a
degree
be
influence
by
her
in
mark
out
the
scheme
of
retrenchment
which
be
at
last
submit
to
Sir
Walter
.
<EOS>
every
emendation
of
Anne
's
have
be
on
the
side
of
honesty
against
importance
.
<EOS>
She
want
more
vigorous
measure
,
a
more
complete
reformation
,
a
quick
release
from
debt
,
a
much
high
tone
of
indifference
for
everything
but
justice
and
equity
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
we
can
persuade
your
father
to
all
this
,
"
say
Lady
Russell
,
look
over
her
paper
,
"
much
may
be
do
.
<EOS>
if
he
will
adopt
these
regulation
,
in
seven
year
he
will
be
clear
;
and
I
hope
we
may
be
able
to
convince
him
and
Elizabeth
,
that
Kellynch
Hall
have
a
respectability
in
itself
which
can
not
be
affect
by
these
reduction
;
and
that
the
true
dignity
of
Sir
Walter
Elliot
will
be
very
far
from
lessen
in
the
eye
of
sensible
people
,
by
act
like
a
man
of
principle
.
<EOS>
what
will
he
be
do
,
in
fact
,
but
what
very
many
of
our
first
family
have
do
,
or
ought
to
do
?
<EOS>
there
will
be
nothing
singular
in
his
case
;
and
it
be
singularity
which
often
make
the
bad
part
of
our
suffering
,
as
it
always
do
of
our
conduct
.
<EOS>
I
have
great
hope
of
prevail
.
<EOS>
We
must
be
serious
and
decide
;
for
after
all
,
the
person
who
have
contract
debt
must
pay
them
;
and
though
a
great
deal
be
due
to
the
feeling
of
the
gentleman
,
and
the
head
of
a
house
,
like
your
father
,
there
be
still
more
due
to
the
character
of
an
honest
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
principle
on
which
Anne
want
her
father
to
be
proceed
,
his
friend
to
be
urge
him
.
<EOS>
She
consider
it
as
an
act
of
indispensable
duty
to
clear
away
the
claim
of
creditor
with
all
the
expedition
which
the
most
comprehensive
retrenchment
could
secure
,
and
see
no
dignity
in
anything
short
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
want
it
to
be
prescribe
,
and
feel
as
a
duty
.
<EOS>
She
rate
Lady
Russell
's
influence
highly
;
and
as
to
the
severe
degree
of
self
-
denial
which
her
own
conscience
prompt
,
she
believe
there
may
be
little
more
difficulty
in
persuade
them
to
a
complete
,
than
to
half
a
reformation
.
<EOS>
Her
knowledge
of
her
father
and
Elizabeth
incline
her
to
think
that
the
sacrifice
of
one
pair
of
horse
would
be
hardly
less
painful
than
of
both
,
and
so
on
,
through
the
whole
list
of
Lady
Russell
be
too
gentle
reduction
.
  
<EOS>
how
Anne
's
more
rigid
requisition
may
have
be
take
be
of
little
consequence
.
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
's
have
no
success
at
all
:
could
not
be
put
up
with
,
be
not
to

Quit

the
hint
be
immediately
take
up
by
Mr
Shepherd
,
whose
interest
be
involve
in
the
reality
of
Sir
Walter
's
retrenching

and
who
be
perfectly
persuade

nothing

the
idea

start
in
the
very
quarter
which
ought
to
dictate

he
have
no
scruple
,
"
he
say
,
"
in
confess
his
judgement
to
be
entirely
on
that
side
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
appear
to
him
that
Sir
Walter
could
materially
alter
his
style
of
live
in
a
house
which
have
such
a
character
of
hospitality
and
ancient
dignity
to
support
.
<EOS>
in
any
other
place
Sir
Walter
may
judge
for
himself
;
and
would
be
look
up
to
,
as
regulate
the
mode
of
life
in
whatever
way
he
may
choose
to
model
his
household
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
would
quit
Kellynch
Hall
;
and
after
a
very
few
day
more
of
doubt
and
indecision
,
the
great
question
of
whither
he
should
go
be
settle
,
and
the
first
outline
of
this
important
change
make
out
.
  
<EOS>
there
have
be
three
alternative
,
London
,
Bath
,
or
another
house
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
all
Anne
's
wish
have
be
for
the
latter
.
<EOS>
a
small
house
in
their
own
neighbourhood
,
where
they
may
still
have
Lady
Russell
's
society
,
still
be
near
Mary
,
and
still
have
the
pleasure
of
sometimes
see
the
lawn
and
grove
of
Kellynch
,
be
the
object
of
her
ambition
.
<EOS>
but
the
usual
fate
of
Anne
attend
her
,
in
have
something
very
opposite
from
her
inclination
fix
on
.
<EOS>
She
dislike
Bath
,
and
do
not
think
it
agree
with
her
;
and
Bath
be
to
be
her
home
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
have
at
first
thought
more
of
London
;
but
Mr
Shepherd
feel
that
he
could
not
be
trust
in
London
,
and
have
be
skilful
enough
to
dissuade
him
from
it
,
and
make
Bath
prefer
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
much
safe
place
for
a
gentleman
in
his
predicament
:
he
may
there
be
important
at
comparatively
little
expense
.
<EOS>
two
material
advantage
of
Bath
over
London
have
of
course
be
give
all
their
weight
:
its
more
convenient
distance
from
Kellynch
,
only
fifty
mile
,
and
Lady
Russell
's
spend
some
part
of
every
winter
there
;
and
to
the
very
great
satisfaction
of
Lady
Russell
,
whose
first
view
on
the
project
change
have
be
for
Bath
,
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
be
induce
to
believe
that
they
should
lose
neither
consequence
nor
enjoyment
by
settle
there
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
feel
oblige
to
oppose
her
dear
Anne
's
know
wish
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
too
much
to
expect
Sir
Walter
to
descend
into
a
small
house
in
his
own
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
Anne
herself
would
have
find
the
mortification
of
it
more
than
she
foresee
,
and
to
Sir
Walter
's
feeling
they
must
have
be
dreadful
.
<EOS>
and
with
regard
to
Anne
's
dislike
of
Bath
,
she
consider
it
as
a
prejudice
and
mistake
arise
,
first
,
from
the
circumstance
of
her
have
be
three
year
at
school
there
,
after
her
mother
's
death
;
and
secondly
,
from
her
happen
to
be
not
in
perfectly
good
spirit
<EOS>
the
only
winter
which
she
have
afterwards
spend
there
with
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
be
fond
of
Bath
,
in
short
,
and
dispose
to
think
it
must
suit
them
all
;
and
as
to
her
young
friend
's
health
,
by
pass
all
the
warm
month
with
her
at
Kellynch
Lodge
,
every
danger
would
be
avoid
;
and
it
be
in
fact
,
a
change
which
must
do
both
health
and
spirit
good
.
<EOS>
Anne
have
be
too
little
from
home
,
too
little
see
.
<EOS>
Her
spirit
be
not
high
.
<EOS>
a
large
society
would
improve
them
.
<EOS>
She
want
her
to
be
more
know
.
  
<EOS>
the
undesirableness
of
any
other
house
in
the
same
neighbourhood
for
Sir
Walter
be
certainly
much
strengthen
by
one
part
,
and
a
very
material
part
of
the
scheme
,
which
have
be
happily
engraft
on
the
beginning
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
only
to
quit
his
home
,
but
to
see
it
in
the
hand
of
other
;
a
trial
of
fortitude
,
which
strong
head
than
Sir
Walter
's
have
find
too
much
.
<EOS>
Kellynch
Hall
be
to
be
let
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
a
profound
secret
,
not
to
be
breathe
beyond
their
own
circle
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
could
not
have
bear
the
degradation
of
be
know
to
design
let
his
house
.
<EOS>
Mr
Shepherd
have
once
mention
the
word
"
advertise
,
"
but
never
dare
approach
it
again
.
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
spurn
the
idea
of
its
be
offer
in
any
manner
;
forbad
the
slight
hint
be
drop
of
his
have
such
an
intention
;
and
it
be
only
on
the
supposition
of
his
be
spontaneously
solicit
by
some
most
unexceptionable
applicant
,
on
his
own
term
,
and
as
a
great
favour
,
that
he
would
let
it
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
how
quick
come
the
reason
for
approve
what
we
like
!
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
have
another
excellent
one
at
hand
,
for
be
extremely
glad
that
Sir
Walter
and
his
family
be
to
remove
from
the
country
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
have
be
lately
form
an
intimacy
,
which
she
wish
to
see
interrupt
.
<EOS>
It
be
with
the
daughter
of
Mr
Shepherd
,
who
have
return
,
after
an
unprosperous
marriage
,
to
her
father
's
house
,
with
the
additional
burden
of
two
child
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
clever
young
woman
,
who
understand
the
art
of
pleasing
 
the
art
of
pleasing
,
at
least
,
at
Kellynch
Hall
;
and
who
have
make
herself
so
acceptable
to
Miss
Elliot
,
as
to
have
be
already
stay
there
more
than
once
,
in
spite
of
all
that
Lady
Russell
,
who
think
it
a
friendship
quite
out
of
place
,
could
hint
of
caution
and
reserve
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
,
indeed
,
have
scarcely
any
influence
with
Elizabeth
,
and
seem
to
love
her
,
rather
because
she
would
love
her
,
than
because
Elizabeth
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
receive
from
her
more
than
outward
attention
,
nothing
beyond
the
observance
of
complaisance
;
have
never
succeed
in
any
point
which
she
want
to
carry
,
against
previous
inclination
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
repeatedly
very
earnest
in
try
to
get
Anne
include
in
the
visit
to
London
,
sensibly
open
to
all
the
injustice
and
all
the
discredit
of
the
selfish
arrangement
which
shut
her
out
,
and
on
many
less
occasion
have
endeavour
to
give
Elizabeth
the
advantage
of
her
own
well
judgement
and
experience
;
but
always
in
vain
:
Elizabeth
would
go
her
own
way
;
and
never
have
she
pursue
it
in
more
decide
opposition
to
Lady
Russell
than
in
this
selection
of
Mrs
Clay
;
turn
from
the
society
of
so
deserve
a
sister
,
to
bestow
her
affection
and
confidence
on
one
who
ought
to
have
be
nothing
to
her
<EOS>
but
the
object
of
distant
civility
.
  
<EOS>
from
situation
,
Mrs
Clay
be
,
in
Lady
Russell
's
estimate
,
a
very
unequal
,
and
in
her
character
she
believe
a
very
dangerous
companion
;
and
a
removal
that
would
leave
Mrs
Clay
behind
,
and
bring
a
choice
of
more
suitable
intimate
within
Miss
Elliot
's
reach

be
therefore
an
object
of
first

importance

<EOS>
"
I
must
take
leave
to
observe
,
Sir
Walter
,
"
say
Mr
Shepherd
one
morning
at
Kellynch
Hall
,
as
he
lay
down
the
newspaper
,
"
that
the
present
juncture
be
much
in
our
favour
.
<EOS>
this
peace
will
be
turn
all
our
rich
naval
officer
ashore
.
<EOS>
They
will
be
all
want
a
home
.
<EOS>
Could
not
be
a
well
time
,
Sir
Walter
,
for
have
a
choice
of
tenant
,
very
responsible
tenant
.
<EOS>
many
a
noble
fortune
have
be
make
during
the
war
.
<EOS>
if
a
rich
admiral
be
to
come
in
our
way
,
Sir
Walter
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
would
be
a
very
lucky
man
,
Shepherd
,
"
reply
Sir
Walter
;
"
that
be
all
I
have
to
remark
.
<EOS>
a
prize
indeed
would
Kellynch
Hall
be
to
him
;
rather
the
great
prize
of
all
,
let
him
have
take
ever
so
many
before
;
hey
,
Shepherd
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Shepherd
laugh
,
as
he
know
he
must
,
at
this
wit
,
and
then
add
    
<EOS>
"
I
presume
to
observe
,
Sir
Walter
,
that
,
in
the
way
of
business
,
gentleman
of
the
navy
be
well
to
deal
with
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
a
little
knowledge
of
their
method
of
do
business
;
and
I
be
free
to
confess
that
they
have
very
liberal
notion
,
and
be
as
likely
to
make
desirable
tenant
as
any
set
of
people
one
should
meet
with
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
Sir
Walter
,
what
I
would
take
leave
to
suggest
be
,
that
if
in
consequence
of
any
rumour
get
abroad
of
your
intention
;
which
must
be
contemplate
as
a
possible
thing
,
because
we
know
how
difficult
it
be
to
keep
the
action
and
design
of
one
part
of
the
world
from
the
notice
and
curiosity
of
the
other
;
consequence
have
its
tax
;
I
,
John
Shepherd
,
may
conceal
any
family
-
matter
that
I
choose
,
for
nobody
would
think
it
worth
their
while
to
observe
me
;
but
Sir
Walter
Elliot
have
eye
upon
him
which
it
may
be
very
difficult
to
elude
;
and
therefore
,
thus
much
I
venture
upon
,
that
it
will
not
greatly
surprise
me
if
,
with
all
our
caution
,
some
rumour
of
the
truth
should
get
abroad
;
in
the
supposition
of
which
,
as
I
be
go
to
observe
,
since
application
will
unquestionably
follow
,
I
should
think
any
from
our
wealthy
naval
commander
particularly
worth
attend
to
;
and
beg
leave
to
add
,
that
two
hour
will
bring
me
over
at
any
time
,
to
save
you
the
trouble
of
reply
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
only
nod
.
<EOS>
but
soon
afterwards
,
rise
and
pace
the
room
,
he
observe
sarcastically
    
"
there
be
few
among
the
gentleman
of
the
navy
,
I
imagine
,
who
would
not
be
surprised
to
find
themselves
in
a
house
of
this
description
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
They
would
look
around
them
,
no
doubt
,
and
bless
their
good
fortune
,
"
say
Mrs
Clay
,
for
Mrs
Clay
be
present
:
her
father
have
drive
her
over
,
nothing
being
of
so
much
use
to
Mrs
Clay
's
health
as
a
drive
to
Kellynch
:
"
<EOS>
but
I
quite
agree
with
my
father
in
think
a
sailor
may
be
a
very
desirable
tenant
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
a
good
deal
of
the
profession
;
and
besides
their
liberality
,
they
be
so
neat
and
careful
in
all
their
way
!
<EOS>
these
valuable
picture
of
yours
,
Sir
Walter
,
if
you
choose
to
leave
them
,
would
be
perfectly
safe
.
<EOS>
everything
in
and
about
the
house
would
be
take
such
excellent
care
of
!
<EOS>
the
garden
and
shrubbery
would
be
keep
in
almost
as
high
order
as
they
be
now
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
be
afraid
,
Miss
Elliot
,
of
your
own
sweet
flower
garden
be
neglect
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
as
to
all
that
,
"
rejoin
Sir
Walter
coolly
,
"
suppose
I
be
induce
to
let
my
house
,
I
have
by
no
mean
make
up
my
mind
as
to
the
privilege
to
be
annex
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
particularly
disposed
to
favour
a
tenant
.
<EOS>
the
park
would
be
open
to
him
of
course
,
and
few
navy
officer
,
or
man
of
any
other
description
,
can
have
have
such
a
range
;
but
what
restriction
I
may
impose
on
the
use
of
the
pleasure
-
ground
,
be
another
thing
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
fond
of
the
idea
of
my
shrubbery
be
always
approachable
;
and
I
should
recommend
Miss
Elliot
to
be
on
her
guard
with
respect
to
her
flower
garden
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
little
disposed
to
grant
a
tenant
of
Kellynch
Hall
any
extraordinary
favour
,
I
assure
you
,
be
he
sailor
or
soldier
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
a
short
pause
,
Mr
Shepherd
presume
to
say
    
"
in
all
these
case
,
there
be
establish
usage
which
make
everything
plain
and
easy
between
landlord
and
tenant

<EOS>
Your
interest
,
Sir
Walter
,
be
in
pretty
safe
hand

<EOS>
depend
upon
me
for
take
care
that
no
tenant
have
more
than
his
just
right
.
<EOS>
I
venture
to
hint
,
that
Sir
Walter
Elliot
can
not
be
half
so
jealous
for
his
own
,
as
John
Shepherd
will
be
for
him
.

here
Anne

at

an
equal
claim

Mr

certainly

be
his
daughter

;
but
Sir
Walter
's
remark
be
,
soon
afterwards
    
"
<EOS>
the
profession
have
its
utility
,
but
I
should
be
sorry
to
see
any

it
.
<EOS>

"
<EOS>
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
be
the
reply
,
and
with
a
look
of
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
it
be
in
two
point
offensive
to
me
;
I
have
two
strong
ground
of
objection
to
it
.
<EOS>
first
,
as
be
the
mean
of
bring
person
of
obscure
birth
into
undue
distinction
,
and
raise
man
to
honour
which
their
father
and
grandfather
never
dreamt
of
;
and
secondly
,
as
it
cut
up
a
man
's
youth
and
vigour
most
horribly
;
a
sailor
grow
old
sooner
than
any
other
man
.
<EOS>
I
have
observe
it
all
my
life
.
<EOS>
a
man
be
in
great
danger
in
the
navy
of
be
insult
by
the
rise
of
one
whose
father
,
his
father
may
have
disdain
to
speak
to
,
and
of
become
prematurely
an
object
of
disgust
himself
,
than
in
any
other
line
.
<EOS>
one
day
last
spring
,
in
town
,
I
be
in
company
with
two
man
,
strike
instance
of
what
I
be
talk
of
;
Lord
St
Ives
,
whose
father
we
all
know
to
have
be
a
country
curate
,
without
bread
to
eat
;
<EOS>
I
be
to
give
place
to
Lord
St
Ives
,
and
a
certain
Admiral
Baldwin
,
the
most
deplorable
-
look
personage
you
can
imagine
;
his
face
the
colour
of
mahogany
,
rough
and
rugged
to
the
last
degree
;
all
line
and
wrinkle
,
nine
grey
hair
of
a
side
,
and
nothing
but
a
dab
of
powder
at
top
.
<EOS>
"
in
the
name
of
heaven
,
who
be
that
old
fellow
?

say
I
to
a
friend
of
mine

be
stand
near

(
Sir
Basil
Morley

<EOS>
"
old
fellow

Sir

it

what
do
you
take
his

perhaps
sixty

two

"
forty

Sir

"
forty

no
more

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
picture
to
yourself
my
amazement
;
I
shall
not
easily
forget
Admiral
Baldwin
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
quite
so
wretched
an
example
of
what
a
sea
-
fare
life
can
do
;
but
to
a
degree
,
I
know
it
be
the
same
with
them
all
:
they
be
all
knock
about
,
and
expose
to
every
climate
,
and
every
weather
,
till
they
be
not
fit
to
be

.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
they
be
not
knock
on
the
head
at
once
,
before
they
reach
Admiral
Baldwin
's
age

"
Nay

<EOS>
in
fact

as
I
have
long
be
convince

though
every
profession
be
necessary

honourable
in
its
turn
,
it

only
the
lot
of

Mr

in
this
anxiety
to
bespeak
Sir

good
will
towards
a
naval
officer

have

for

he
have

by

well

a

beat

to
be
sure

not
much

quite
the

in
all
his

not

make
the

difficulty
about
term

only
want
a
comfortable

get
into

as
soon

know

know
what

consequence
may
fetch

should
not

be
surprise

would
be
glad
of
the
deputation

certainly

make
no
great
point

it

he
sometimes
take
out
a

never

quite
the
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Shepherd
be
eloquent
on
the
subject
;
point
out
all
the
circumstance
of
the
Admiral
's
family
,
which
make
him
peculiarly
desirable
as
a
tenant
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
married
man
,
and
without
child
;
the
very
state
to
be
wish
for
.
<EOS>
a
house
be
never
take
good
care
of
,
Mr
Shepherd
observe
,
without
a
lady
:
<EOS>
he
do
not
know
,
whether
furniture
may
not
be
in
danger
of
suffer
as
much
where
there
be
no
lady
,
as
where
there
be
many
child
.
<EOS>
a
lady
,
without
a
family
,
be
the
very
good
preserver
of
furniture
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
He
have
see
Mrs
Croft
,
too
;
she
be
at
Taunton
with
the
admiral
,
and
have
be
present
almost
all
the
time
they
be
talk
the
matter
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
a
very
well
-
speak
,
genteel
,
shrewd
lady
,
she
seem
to
be
,
"
continue
he
;
"
ask
more
question
about
the
house
,
and
term
,
and
taxis
,
than
the
Admiral
himself
,
and
seem
more
conversant
with
business
;
and
moreover
,
Sir
Walter
,
I
find
she
be
not
quite
unconnected
in
this
country
,
any
more
than
her
husband
;
that
be
to
say
,
she
be
sister
to
a
gentleman
who
do
live
amongst
us
once
;
she
tell
me
so
herself
:
sister
to
the
gentleman
who
live
a
few
year
back
at
Monkford
.
<EOS>
bless
me
!
<EOS>
what
be
his
name
?
<EOS>
at
this
moment
I
can
not
recollect
his
name
,
though
I
have
hear
it
so
lately
.
<EOS>
Penelope
,
my
dear
,
can
you
help
me
to
the
name
of
the
gentleman
who
live
at
Monkford
:
<EOS>
Mrs
Croft
's
brother
?
"
  
<EOS>
but
Mrs
Clay
be
talk
so
eagerly
with
Miss
Elliot
,
that
she
do
not
hear
the
appeal
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
conception
whom
you
can
mean
,
Shepherd
;
I
remember
no
gentleman
resident
at
Monkford
since
the
time
of
old
Governor
Trent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
bless
me
!
<EOS>
how
very
odd
!
<EOS>
I
shall
forget
my
own
name
soon
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
a
name
that
I
be
so
very
well
acquaint
with
;
know
the
gentleman
so
well
by
sight
;
see
him
a
hundred
time
;
come
to
consult
me
once
<EOS>
,
I
remember
,
about
a
trespass
of
one
of
his
neighbour
;
farmer
's
man
break
into
his
orchard
;
wall
tear
down
;
apple
steal
;
catch
in
the
fact
;
and
afterwards
,
contrary
to
my
judgement
,
submit
to
an
amicable
compromise
.
<EOS>
very
odd
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
wait
another
moment

<EOS>
You
mean
Mr
Wentworth

Anne

Mr

all
gratitude

the

Mr

man

He

the

for
two

three

there
about
the

<EOS>

take
it

<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
ay
,
 
<EOS>
Mr
Wentworth
,
the
curate
of
Monkford
.
<EOS>
You
mislead
me
by
the
term
gentleman
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
be
speak
of
some
man
of
property
:
<EOS>
Mr
Wentworth
be
nobody
,
I
remember
;
quite
unconnected
;
nothing
to
do
with
the
Strafford
family
.
<EOS>
one
wonder
how
the
name
of
many
of
our
nobility
become
so
common
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
Mr
Shepherd
perceive
that
this
connexion
of
the
Crofts
do
them
no
service
with
Sir
Walter
,
he
mention
it
no
more
;
return
,
with
all
his
zeal
,
to
dwell
on
the
circumstance
more
indisputably
in
their
favour
;
their
age
,
and
number
,
and
fortune
;
the
high
idea
they
have
form
of
Kellynch
Hall
,
and
extreme
solicitude
for
the
advantage
of
rent
it
;
<EOS>
make
it
appear
as
if
they
rank
nothing
beyond
the
happiness
of
be
the
tenant
of
Sir
Walter
Elliot
:
an
extraordinary
taste
,
certainly
,
could
they
have
be
suppose
in
the
secret
of
Sir
Walter
's
estimate
of
the
due
of
a
tenant
.
  
<EOS>
It
succeed
,
however
;
and
though
Sir
Walter
must
ever
look
with
an
evil
eye
on
anyone
intend
to
inhabit
that
house
,
and
think
them
infinitely
too
well
off
in
be
permit
to
rent
it
on
the
high
term
,
he
be
talk
into
allow
Mr
Shepherd
to
proceed
in
the
treaty
,
and
authorise
him
to
wait
on
Admiral
Croft
,
who
still
remain
at
Taunton
,
and
fix
a
day
for
the
house
be
see
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
be
not
very
wise
;
but
still
he
have
experience
enough
of
the
world
to
feel
,
that
a
more
unobjectionable
tenant
,
in
all
essential
,
than
Admiral
Croft
bid
fair
to
be
,
could
hardly
offer
.
<EOS>
so
far
go
his
understanding
;
and
his
vanity
supply
a
little
additional
soothing
,
in
the
Admiral
's
situation
in
life
,
which
be
just
high
enough
,
and
not
too
high
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
let
my
house
to
Admiral
Croft
,
"
would
sound
extremely
well
;
very
much
well
than
to
any
mere
<EOS>
Mr
 
;
a
Mr
(
save
,
perhaps
,
some
half
dozen
in
the
nation
,
)
always
need
a
note
of
explanation
.
<EOS>
an
admiral
speak
his
own
consequence
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
can
never
make
a
baronet
look
small
.
<EOS>
in
all
their
dealing
and
intercourse
,
Sir
Walter
Elliot
must
ever
have
the
precedence
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
do
without
a
reference
to
Elizabeth
:
but
her
inclination
be
grow
so
strong
for
a
removal
,
that
she
be
happy
to
have
it
fix
and
expedite
by
a
tenant
at
hand
;
and
not
a
word
to
suspend
decision
be
utter
by
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Shepherd
be
completely
empower
to
act
;
and
no
sooner
have
such
an
end
be
reach
,
than
Anne
,
who
have
be
a
most
attentive
listener
to
the
whole
,
leave
the
room
,
to
seek
the
comfort
of
cool
air
for
her
flushed
cheek
;
and
as
she
walk
along
a
favourite
grove
,
say
,
with
a
gentle
sigh
,
"
a
few
month
more
,
and
he
,
perhaps
,
may
be
walk
here
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
He
be
not
Mr
Wentworth
,
the
former
curate
of
Monkford
,
however
suspicious
appearance
may
be
,
but
a
Captain
Frederick
Wentworth
,
his
brother
,
who
be
make
commander
in
consequence
of
the
action
off
St
Domingo
,
and
not
immediately
employ
,
have
come
into
Somersetshire
,
in
the
summer
of
1806
;
and
have
no
parent
living
,
find
a
home
for
half
a
year
at
Monkford
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
at
that
time
,
a
remarkably
fine
young
man
,
with
a
great
deal
of
intelligence
,
spirit
,
and
brilliancy
;
and
Anne
an
extremely
pretty
girl
,
with
gentleness
,
modesty
,
taste
,
and
feeling
.
<EOS>
half
the
sum
of
attraction
,
on
either
side
,
may
have
be
enough
,
for
he
have
nothing
to
do
,
and
she
have
hardly
anybody
to
love
;
but
the
encounter
of
such
lavish
recommendation
could
not
fail
.
<EOS>
They
be
gradually
acquaint
,
and
when
acquaint
,
rapidly
and
deeply
in
love
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
difficult
to
say
which
have
see
high
perfection
in
the
other
,
or
which
have
be
the
happy
:
<EOS>
she
,
in
receive
his
declaration
and
proposal
,
or
he
in
have
them
accept
.
  
<EOS>
a
short
period
of
exquisite
felicity
follow
,
and
but
a
short
one
.
<EOS>
trouble
soon
arise
.
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
,
on
be
apply
to
,
without
actually
withhold
his
consent
,
or
say
it
should
never
be

give
it
all
the
negative
of
great
astonishment
,
great
coldness
,
great
silence
,
and
a
professed
resolution
of
do
nothing
for
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
He
think
it
a
very
degrading
alliance
;
and
Lady
Russell
,
though
with
more
tempered
and
pardonable
pride
,
receive
it
as
a
most
unfortunate
one
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
Elliot
,
with
all
her
claim
of
birth
,
beauty
,
and
mind
,
to
throw
herself
away
at
nineteen
;
involve
herself
at
nineteen
in
an
engagement
with
a
young
man
,
who
have
nothing
but
himself
to
recommend
him
,
and
no
hope
of
attain
affluence
,
but
in
the
chance
of
a
most
uncertain
profession
,
and
no
connexion
to
secure
even
his
farth
rise
in
the
profession
,
would
be
,
indeed
,
a
throwing
away
,
which
she
grieve
to
think
of
!
<EOS>
Anne
Elliot
,
so
young
;
know
to
so
few
,
to
be
snatch
off
by
a
stranger
without
alliance
or
fortune
;
or
rather
sink
by
him
into
a
state
of
most
wearing
,
anxious
,
youth
-
kill
dependence
!
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
,
if
by
any
fair
interference
of
friendship
,
any
representation
from
one
who
have
almost
a
mother

love

and
mother

right

it
would

prevent

<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
have
no
fortune

<EOS>
He
have
be
lucky
in
his
profession
;
but
spend
freely
,
what
have
come
freely
,
have
realize
nothing
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
confident
that
he
should
soon
be
rich
:
full
of
life
and
ardour
<EOS>
,
he
know
that
he
should
soon
have
a
ship
,
and
soon
be
on
a
station
that
would
lead
to
everything
he
want
.
<EOS>
He
have
always
be
lucky
;
he
know
he
should
be
so
still
.
<EOS>
such
confidence
,
powerful
in
its
own
warmth
,
and
bewitch
in
the
wit
which
often
express
it
,
must
have
be
enough
for
Anne
;
but
Lady
Russell
see
it
very
differently
.
<EOS>
His
sanguine
temper
,
and
fearlessness
of
mind
,
operate
very
differently
on
her
.
<EOS>
She
see
in
it
but
an
aggravation
of
the
evil
.
<EOS>
It
only
add
a
dangerous
character
to
himself

<EOS>
He
be
brilliant
,
he
be
headstrong
.
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
have
little
taste
for
wit
,
and
of
anything
approach
to
imprudence
a
horror
.
<EOS>
She
deprecate
the
connexion
in
every
light
.
  
<EOS>
such
opposition
,
as
these
feeling
produce
,
be
more
than
Anne
could
combat
.
<EOS>
young
and
gentle
as
she
be
,
it
may
yet
have
be
possible
to
withstand
her
father
's
ill
-
will
,
though
unsoftene
by
one
kind
word
or
look
on
the
part
of
her
sister
;
but
Lady
Russell
,
whom
she
have
always
love
and
rely
on
,
could
not
,
with
such
steadiness
of
opinion
,
and
such
tenderness
of
manner
,
be
continually
advise
her
in
vain
.
<EOS>
She
be
persuade
to
believe
the
engagement
a
wrong
thing
:
<EOS>
indiscreet
,
improper
,
hardly
capable
of
success
,
and
not
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
a
merely
selfish
caution
,
under
which
she
act
,
in
put
an
end
to
it
.
<EOS>
have
she
not
imagine
herself
consult
his
good

even
more
than
her

she
could
hardly
have
give
him
up
.
<EOS>
the
belief
of
be
prudent
,
and
self

deny
,
principally
for
his
advantage
,
be
her
chief
consolation
,
under
the
misery
of
a
parting
,
a
final
parting
;
and
every
consolation
be
require
,
for
she
have
to
encounter
all
the
additional
pain
of
opinion
,
on
his
side
,
totally
unconvinced
and
unbending
,
and
of
his
feeling
himself
<EOS>
ill
use
by
so
force
a
relinquishment
.
<EOS>
He
have
leave
the
country
in
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
a
few
month
have
see
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
their
acquaintance
;
but
not
with
a
few
month
end
Anne
's
share
of
suffer
from
it
.
<EOS>
Her
attachment
and
regret
have
,
for
a
long
time
,
cloud
every
enjoyment
of
youth
,
and
an
early
loss
of
bloom
and
spirit
have
be
their
lasting
effect
.
  
<EOS>
More
than
seven
year
be
go
since
this
little
history
of
sorrowful
interest
have
reach
its
close
;
and
time
have
soften
down
much
,
perhaps
nearly
all
of
peculiar
attachment
to
him
,
but
she
have
be
too
dependent
on
time
alone
;
no
aid
have
be
give
in
change
of
place
(
except
in
one
visit
to
Bath
soon
after
the
rupture
)
,
or
in
any
novelty
or
enlargement
of
society
.
<EOS>
no
one
have
ever
come
within
the
Kellynch
circle
,
who
could
bear
a
comparison
with
Frederick
Wentworth
,
as
he
stand
in
her
memory
.
<EOS>
no
second
attachment
,
the
only
thoroughly
natural
,
happy
,
and
sufficient
cure
,
at
her
time
of
life
,
have
be
possible
to
the
nice
tone
of
her
mind
,
the
fastidiousness
of
her
taste
,
in
the
small
limit
of
the
society
around
them
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
solicit
,
when
about
two
-
and
-
twenty
,
to
change
her
name
,
by
the
young
man
,
who
not
long
afterwards
find
a
more
willing
mind
in
her
young
sister
;
and
Lady
Russell
have
lament
her
refusal
;
for
Charles
Musgrove
be
the
eld
son
of
a
man
,
whose
land
property
and
general
importance
be
second
in
that
country
,
only
to
Sir
Walter
's
,
and
of
good
character
and
appearance
;
and
however
Lady
Russell
may
have
ask
yet
for
something
more
,
while
Anne
be
nineteen
,
she
would
have
rejoice
to
see
her
at
twenty
-
two
so
respectably
remove
from
the
partiality
and
injustice
of
her
father
's
house
,
and
settle
so
permanently
near
herself
.
<EOS>
but
in
this
case
,
Anne
have
leave
nothing
for
advice
to
do
;
and
though
Lady
Russell
,
as
satisfied
as
ever
with
her
own
discretion
,
never
wish
the
past
undone
,
she
begin
now
to
have
the
anxiety
which
border
on
hopelessness
for
<EOS>
Anne
's
be
tempt
,
by
some
man
of
talent
and
independence
,
to
enter
a
state
for
which
she
hold
her
to
be
peculiarly
fit
by
her
warm
affection
and
domestic
habit
.
  
<EOS>
They
know
not
each
other
's
opinion
,
either
its
constancy
or
its
change
,
on
the
one
lead
point
of
Anne
's
conduct
,
for
the
subject
be
never
allude
to
;
but
Anne
,
at
seven
-
and
-
twenty
,
think
very
differently
from
what
she
have
be
make
to
think
at
nineteen
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
blame
Lady
Russell
<EOS>
,
she
do
not
blame
herself
for
have
be
guide
by
her
;
but
she
feel
that
be
any
young
person
,
in
similar
circumstance
,
to
apply
to
her
for
counsel
,
they
would
never
receive
any
of
such
certain
immediate
wretchedness
,
such
uncertain
future
good
.
<EOS>
She
be
persuade
that
under
every

his

all
their
probable
fear
,
delay
,
and
disappointment
,
she
should
yet
have
be
a
happy
woman
in
maintain
the
engagement
,
than
she
have
be
in
the
sacrifice
of
it
;
and
this
,
she
fully
believe
,
have
the
usual
share
,
have
even
more
than
the
usual
share
of
all
such
solicitude
and
suspense
be
theirs
,
without
reference
to
the
actual
result
of
their
case
,
which
,
as
it
happen
,
would
have
bestow
early
prosperity
than
could
be

<EOS>
all
his
sanguine
expectation
,
all
his
confidence
have
be
justify
.
<EOS>
His
genius
and
ardour
have
seem
to
foresee
and
to
command
his
prosperous
path
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
very
soon
after
their
engagement
cease
,
get
employ
:
and
all
that
he
have
tell
her
would
follow
,
have
take
place
.
<EOS>
He
have
distinguish
himself
,
and
early
gain
the
other
step
in
rank
,
and
must
now
,
by
successive
capture
,
have
make
a
handsome
fortune
.
<EOS>
She
have
only
navy
list
and
newspaper
for
her
authority
,
but
she
could
not
doubt
his
be
rich
;
and
,
in
favour
of
his
constancy
,
she
have
no
reason
to
believe
him
married
.
  
<EOS>
how
eloquent
could
Anne
Elliot
have
be
!
<EOS>
how
eloquent
,
at
least
,
be
her
wish
on
the
side
of
early
warm
attachment
,
and
a
cheerful
confidence
in
futurity
,
against
that
over
-
anxious
caution
which
seem
to
insult
exertion
and
distrust
Providence
!
<EOS>
She
have
be
force
into
prudence
in
her
youth
,
she
learn
romance
as
she
grow
old
:
the
natural
sequel
of
an
unnatural
beginning
.
  
<EOS>
with
all
these
circumstance
,
recollection
and
feeling
,
she
could
not
hear
that
Captain
Wentworth
's
sister
be
likely
to
live
at
Kellynch
without
a
revival
of
former
pain
;
and
many
a
stroll
,
and
many
a
sigh
,
be
necessary
to
dispel
the
agitation
of
the
idea
.
<EOS>
She
often
tell
herself
it
be
folly
,
before
she
could
harden
her
nerve
sufficiently
to
feel
the
continual
discussion
of
the
Crofts
and
their
business
no
evil
.
<EOS>
She
be
assist
,
however
,
by
that
perfect
indifference
and
apparent
unconsciousness
,
among
the
only
three
of
her
own
friend
in
the
secret
of
the
past
,
which
seem
almost
to
deny
any
recollection
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
could
do
justice
to
the
superiority
of
Lady
Russell
's
motive
in
this
,
over
those
of
her
father
and
Elizabeth
;
she
could
honour
all
the
well
feeling
of
her
calmness
;
but
the
general
air
of
oblivion
among
them
be
highly
important
from
whatever
it
spring
;
and
in
the
event
of
Admiral
Croft
's
really
take
Kellynch
Hall
,
she
rejoice
anew
over
the
conviction
which
have
always
be
most
grateful
to
her
,
of
the
past
be
know
to
those
three
only
among
her
connexion
,
by
whom
no
syllable
,
she
believe
,
would
ever
be
whisper
,
and
in
the
trust
that
among
his
,
the
brother
only
with
whom
he
have
be
reside
,
have
receive
any
information
of
their
short
-
live
engagement

<EOS>
that
brother
have
be
long
remove
from
the
country
and
be
a
sensible
man
,
and
,
moreover
,
a
single
man
at
the
time
,
she
have
a
fond
dependence
on
no
human
creature
's
have
hear
of
it
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
sister

Mrs
Croft

then
be
out
of
England
,
accompany
her
husband
on
a
foreign
station
,
and
her
own
sister

Mary
,
have
be
at
school
while
it
all
occur
;
and
never
admit
by
the
pride
of
some
,
and
the
delicacy
of
other

to
the
small
knowledge
of
it
afterwards

<EOS>
with
these

she

and
the
Crofts

with
Lady

Kellynch

<EOS>
on
the
morning
appoint
for
Admiral

Mrs

Kellynch
Hall

Anne
find
it
most

take
her
almost
daily
walk
to
Lady

and
keep
out
of

till
all
be
over
;
when
she
find
it
most
natural
to
be
sorry
that
she
have
miss
the
opportunity
of

them

this

Sir

without

declare
the
Admiral
to
be
the
best

look
sailor
he
have
ever

go
so

he

"
 
<EOS>
reciprocal

which
would
have
be
esteem
about
equal

<EOS>
the
Crofts
be

at
Michaelmas
;

as
Sir
Walter
propose
remove

Bath
in

of
the

there
be

Lady

convince

Anne
would
not

allow
to
be
of
any
use
,
or
any
importance
,
in
the
choice
of
the
house
which
they
be
go
to
secure

be
very
unwilling
to
have
her
hurry
away
so
soon
,
and
want
to
make
it
possible
for
her
to
stay
behind
till
she
may
convey
her
to
Bath
herself
after
Christmas
;
but
have
engagement
of
her
own
which
must
take
her
from
Kellynch
for
several
week
,
she
be
unable
to
give
the
full
invitation
she
wish
,
and
Anne
though
dread
the
possible
heat
of
September
in
all
the
white
glare
of
Bath
,
and
grieve
to
forego
all
the
influence
so
sweet
and
so
sad
of
the
autumnal
month
in
the
country
,
do
not
think
that
,
everything
consider
,
she
wish
to
remain
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
most
right
,
and
most
wise
,
and
,
therefore
must
involve
least
suffering
to
go
with
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
something
occur
,
however
,
to
give
her
a
different
duty
.
<EOS>
Mary
,
often
a
little
unwell
,
and
always
think
a
great
deal
of
her
own
complaint
,
and
always
in
the
habit
of
claim
Anne
when
anything
be
the
matter
,
be
indispose
;
and
foreseeing
that
she
should
not
have
a
day
's
health
<EOS>
all
the
autumn
,
entreat
,
or
rather
require
her
,
<EOS>
for
it
be
hardly
entreaty
,
to
come
to
Uppercross
Cottage
,
and
bear
her
company
as
long
as
she
should
want
her
,
instead
of
go
to
Bath
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
possibly
do
without
Anne
,
"
be
Mary
's
reasoning
;
and
Elizabeth
's
reply
be
,
"
then
I
be
sure
Anne
have
better
stay
,
for
nobody
will
want
her
in
Bath
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
to
be
claim
as
a
good
,
though
in
an
improper
style
,
be
at
least
better
than
be
reject
as
no
good
at
all
;
and
Anne
,
glad
to
be
think
of
some
use
,
glad
to
have
anything
mark
out
as
a
duty
,
and
certainly
not
sorry
to
have
the
scene
of
it
in
the
country
,
and
her
own
dear
country
,
readily
agree
to
stay
.
  
<EOS>
this
invitation
of
Mary
's
remove
all
Lady
Russell
's
difficulty
,
and
it
be
consequently
soon
settle
that
Anne
should
not
go
to
Bath
till
Lady
Russell
take
her
,
and
that
all
the
intervene
time
should
be
divide
between
Uppercross
Cottage
and
Kellynch
Lodge
.
  
<EOS>
so
far
all
be
perfectly
right
;
but
Lady
Russell
be
almost
startle
by
the
wrong
of
one
part
of
the
Kellynch
Hall
plan
,
when
it
burst
on
her
,
which
be
,
Mrs
Clay
's
be
engage
to
go
to
Bath
with
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
,
as
a
most
important
and
valuable
assistant
to
the
latter
in
all
the
business
before
her
.
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
be
extremely
sorry
that
such
a
measure
should
have
be
resort
to
at
all
,
wonder
,
grieve
,
and
fear
;
and
the
affront
it
contain
to
Anne
,
in
Mrs
Clay
's
being
of
so
much
use
,
while
Anne
could
be
of
none
,
be
a
very
sore
aggravation
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
herself
be
become
harden
to
such
affront
;
but
she
feel
the
imprudence
of
the
arrangement
quite
as
keenly
as
Lady
Russell
.
<EOS>
with
a
great
deal
of
quiet
observation
,
and
a
knowledge
,
which
she
often
wish
less
,
of
her
father
's
character
,
she
be
sensible
that
result
the
most
serious
to
his
family
from
the
intimacy
be
more
than
possible
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
imagine
that
her
father
have
at
present
an
idea
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Clay
have
freckle
,
and
a
project
tooth
,
and
a
clumsy
wrist
,
which
he
be
continually
make
severe
remark
upon
,
in
her
absence
;
but
she
be
young
,
and
certainly
altogether
well
-
look
,
and
possess
,
in
an
acute
mind
and
assiduous
pleasing
manner
,
infinitely
more
dangerous
attraction
than
any
merely
personal
may
have
be
.
<EOS>
Anne
be
so
impressed
by
the
degree
of
their
danger
,
that
she
could
not
excuse
herself
from
try
to
make
it
perceptible
to
her
sister
.
<EOS>
She
have
little
hope
of
success
;
but
Elizabeth
,
who
in
the
event
of
such
a
reverse
would
be
so
much
more
to
be
pity
than
herself
,
should
never
,
she
think
,
have
reason
to
reproach
her
for
give
no
warning
.
  
<EOS>
She
speak
,
and
seem
only
to
offend
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
could
not
conceive
how
such
an
absurd
suspicion
should
occur
to
her
,
and
indignantly
answer
for
each
party
's
perfectly
know
their
situation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Clay
,
"
say
she
,
warmly
,
"
never
forget
who
she
be
;
and
as
I
be
rather
better
acquaint
with
her
sentiment
than
you
can
be
,
I
can
assure
you
,
that
upon
the
subject
of
marriage
they
be
particularly
nice
,
and
that
she
reprobate
all
inequality
of
condition
and
rank
more
strongly
than
most
people
.
<EOS>
and
as
to
my
father
,
I
really
should
not
have
think
that
he
,
who
have
keep
himself
single
so
long
for
our
sake
,
nee
be
suspect
now
.
<EOS>
if
Mrs
Clay
be
a
very
beautiful
woman
,
I
grant
you
,
it
may
be
wrong
to
have
her
so
much
with
me
;
not
that
anything
in
the
world
,
I
be
sure
,
would
induce
my
father
to
make
a
degrading
match
,
but
he
may
be
render
unhappy
.
<EOS>
but
poor
Mrs
Clay
who
,
with
all
her
merit
,
can
never
have
be
reckon
tolerably
pretty
<EOS>
,
I
really
think
poor
Mrs
Clay
may
be
stay
here
in
perfect
safety
.
<EOS>
one
would
imagine
you
have
never
hear
my
father
speak
of
her
personal
misfortune
,
though
I
know
you
must
fifty
time
.
<EOS>
that
tooth
of
her
be
and
those
freckle
.
<EOS>
freckle
do
not
disgust
me
so
very
much
as
they
do
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
a
face
not
materially
disfigure
by
a
few
,
but
he
abominate
them
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
hear
him
notice
Mrs

freckle

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there

hardly
any
personal

Anne

which
an
agreeable

.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

I

very
differently

answer
Elizabeth

shortly
;
"
an

manner
may
set
off
handsome

but
can
never
alter
plain
one

<EOS>
however
,
at
any
rate
,
as
I
have
a
great
deal
more
at
stake
on
this
point
than
anybody
else
can
have
,
I
think
it
rather
unnecessary
in
you
to
be
advise
me

"
  
<EOS>
Anne
have
do
;
glad
that
it
be
over
,
and
not
absolutely
hopeless
of
do
good
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
,
though
resent
the
suspicion
,
may
yet
be
make
observant
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
last
office
of
the
four
carriage
-
horse
be
to
draw
Sir
Walter
,
Miss
Elliot
,
and
Mrs

to
Bath

<EOS>
the
party
drive
off
in
very
good
spirit

Sir
Walter
prepare
with
condescending
bow
for
all
the
afflict
tenantry
and
cottager
who
may
have
have
a
hint
to
show
themselves
,
and
Anne
walk
up
at
the

time
,
in
a
sort
of
desolate
tranquillity
,
to
the
Lodge
,
where
she
be

spend
the
first
week

Her

Lady

feel
this
break

up

family
exceedingly
.
<EOS>
Their
respectability
be
as
dear
to
her
as
her
own
,
and
a
daily
intercourse
have
become
precious
by
habit
.
<EOS>
It
be
painful
to
look
upon
their
desert
ground
,
and
still
bad
to
anticipate
the
new
hand
they
be
to
fall
into
;
and
to
escape
the
solitariness
and
the
melancholy
of
so
alter
a
village
,
and
be
out
of
the
way
when
Admiral

Mrs
Croft
first
arrive
,
she
have
determine
to
make
her
own
absence

accordingly
their

upon
the
marriage
of
the

improvement
of
a

for
his
residence
,
and
Uppercross
Cottage
,
with
its
veranda
,
french
window
,
and
other
prettiness
,
be
quite
as
likely
to
catch
the
traveller
's
eye
as
the
more
consistent
and
considerable
aspect
and
premise
of
the
Great
House
,
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
farther
on
.
  
<EOS>
here
Anne
have
often
be
stay
.
<EOS>
She
know
the
way
of
Uppercross
as
well
as
those
of
Kellynch
.
<EOS>
the
two
family
be
so
continually
meet
,
so
much
in
the
habit
of
run
in
and
out
of
each
other
's
house
at
all
hour
,
that
it
be
rather
a
surprise
to
her
to
find
Mary
alone
;
but
be
alone
,
her
be
unwell
and
out
of
spirit
be
almost
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
though
better
endow
than
the
eld
sister
,
Mary
have
not
Anne
's
understanding
nor
temper
.
<EOS>
while
well
,
and
happy
,
and
properly
attend
to
,
she
have
great
good
humour
and
excellent
spirit
;
but
any
indisposition
sink
her
completely
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
resource
for
solitude
;
and
inherit
a
considerable
share
of
the
Elliot
self
-
importance
,
be
very
prone
to
add
to
every
other
distress
that
of
fancy
herself
neglect
and
ill
-
use
.
<EOS>
in
person
,
she
be
inferior
to
both
sister
,
and
have
,
even
in
her
bloom
,
only
reach
the
dignity
of
be
"
a
fine
girl
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
now
lie
on
the
fade
sofa
of
the
pretty
little
drawing
-
room
,
the
once
elegant
furniture
of
which
have
be
gradually
grow
shabby
,
under
the
influence
of
four
summer
and
two
child
;
and
,
on
Anne
's
appearing
,
greet
her
with
    
"
<EOS>
so
,
you
be
come
at
last
!
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
I
should
never
see
you
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
ill
I
can
hardly
speak
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
a
creature
the
whole
morning
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
to
find
you
unwell
,
"
reply
Anne
.
<EOS>
"
You
send
me
such
a
good
account
of
yourself
on
Thursday
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
make
the
good
of
it
;
I
always
do
:
<EOS>
but
I
be
very
far
from
well
at
the
time
;
and
I
do
not
think
I
ever
be
so
ill
in
my
life
as
I
have
be
all
this
morning
:
very
unfit
to
be
leave
alone
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
suppose
I
be
to
be
seize
of
a
sudden
in
some
dreadful
way
,
and
not
able
to
ring
the
bell
!
<EOS>
so
,
Lady
Russell
would
not
get
out
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
she
have
be
in
this
house
three
time
this
summer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
say
what
be
proper
,
and
enquire
after
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Charles
be
out
shoot
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
him
since
seven
o'clock
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
,
though
I
tell
him
how
ill
I
be
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
should
not
stay
out
long
;
but
he
have
never
come
back
,
and
now
it
be
almost
one
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
I
have
not
see
a
soul
this
whole
long
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
have
your
little
boy
with
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
as
long
as
I
could
bear
their
noise
;
but
they
be
so
unmanageable
that
they
do
me
more
harm
than
good
.
<EOS>
little
Charles
do
not
mind
a
word
I
say
,
and
Walter
be
grow
quite
as
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
will
soon
be
well
now
,
"
reply
Anne
,
cheerfully
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
always
cure
you
when
I
come
.
<EOS>
how
be
your
neighbour
at
the
Great
House
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
give
you
no
account
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
one
of
them
to
-
day
,
except
Mr
Musgrove
,
who
just
stop
and
speak
through
the
window
,
but
without
get
off
his
horse
;
and
though
I
tell
him
how
ill
I
be
,
<EOS>
not
one
of
them
have
be
near
me
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
happen
to
suit
the
Miss
Musgroves
,
I
suppose
,
and
they
never
put
themselves
out
of
their
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
will
see
them
yet
,
perhaps
,
before
the
morning
be
go
.
<EOS>
It
be
early
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
want
them
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
They
talk
and
laugh
a
great
deal
too
much
for
me
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Anne
,
I
be
so
very
unwell
!
<EOS>
It
be
quite
unkind
of
you
not
to
come
on
Thursday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mary
,
recollect
what
a
comfortable
account
<EOS>
you
send
me
of
yourself
!
<EOS>
You
write
in
the
cheerfullest
manner
,
and
say
you
be
perfectly
well
,
and
in
no
hurry
for
me
;
and
that
be
the
case
,
you
must
be
aware
that
my
wish
would
be
to
remain
with
Lady
Russell
to
the
last
:
and
besides
what
I
feel
on
her
account
,
I
have
really
be
so
busy
,
have
have
so
much
to
do
,
that
I
could
not
very
conveniently
have
leave
Kellynch
sooner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
dear
me
!
<EOS>
what
can
you
possibly
have
to
do
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
great
many
thing
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
More
than
I
can
recollect
in
a
moment
;
but
I
can
tell
you
some
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
make
a
duplicate
of
the
catalogue
of
my
father
's
book
and
picture
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
several
time
in
the
garden
with
Mackenzie
,
try
to
understand
,
and
make
him
understand
,
which
of
Elizabeth
's
plant
be
for
Lady
Russell
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
all
my
own
little
concern
to
arrange
,
book
and
music
to
divide
,
and
all
my
trunk
to
repack
,
from
not
have
understand
in
time
what
be
intend
as
to
the
waggon
:
and
one
thing
I
have
have
to
do
,
Mary
,
of
a
more
trying
nature
:
go
to
almost
every
house
in
the
parish
,
as
a
sort
of
take
-
leave
.
<EOS>
I
be
tell
that
they
wish
it
.
<EOS>
but
all
these
thing
take
up
a
great
deal
of
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
well
!
"
<EOS>
and
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
"
but
you
have
never
ask
me
one
word
about
our
dinner
at
the
Pooles
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
go
then
?
<EOS>
I
have
make
no
enquiry
,
because
I
conclude
you
must
have
be
oblige
to
give
up
the
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
!
<EOS>
I
go
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
well
yesterday
;
nothing
at
all
the
matter
with
me
till
this
morning
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
strange
if
I
have
not
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
you
be
well
enough
,
and
I
hope
you
have
a
pleasant
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
remarkable
.
<EOS>
one
always
know
beforehand
what
the
dinner
will
be
,
and
who
will
be
there
;
and
it
be
so
very
uncomfortable
not
have
a
carriage
of
one
's
own
.
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
take
me
,
and
we
be
so
crowded
!
<EOS>
They
be
both
so
very
large
,
and
take
up
so
much
room
;
and
Mr
Musgrove
always
sit
forward
.
<EOS>
so
,
there
be
I
,
crowd
into
the
back
seat
with
Henrietta
and
Louise
;
and
I
think
it
very
likely
that
my
illness
to
-
day
may
be
owe
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
little
further
perseverance
in
patience
and
force
cheerfulness
on
Anne
's
side
produce
nearly
a
cure
on
Mary
's
.
<EOS>
She
could
soon
sit
upright
on
the
sofa
,
and
begin
to
hope
she
may
be
able
to
leave
it
by
dinner
-
time
.
<EOS>
then
,
forget
to
think
of
it
,
she
be
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
beautify
a
nosegay
;
then
,
she
eat
her
cold
meat
;
and
then
she
be
well
enough
to
propose
a
little
walk
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
shall
we
go
?
"
<EOS>
say
she
,
when
they
be
ready
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
will
not
like
to
call
at
the
Great
House
before
they
have
be
to
see
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
small
objection
on
that
account
,
"
reply
Anne
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
never
think
of
stand
on
such
ceremony
with
people
<EOS>
I
know
so
well
as
Mrs
and
the
Miss
Musgroves
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
but
they
ought
to
call
upon
you
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
They
ought
to
feel
what
be
due
to
you
as
my
sister
.
<EOS>
however
,
we
may
as
well
go
and
sit
with
them
a
little
while
,
and
when
we
have
that
over
,
we
can
enjoy
our
walk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
have
always
think
such
a
style
of
intercourse
highly
imprudent
;
but
she
have
cease
to
endeavour
to
check
it
,
from
believe
that
,
though
there
be
on
each
side
continual
subject
of
offence
,
neither
family
could
now
do
without
it
.
<EOS>
to
the
Great
House
accordingly
they
go
,
to
sit
the
full
half
hour
in
the
old
-
fashioned
square
parlour
,
with
a
small
carpet
and
shine
floor
,
to
which
the
present
daughter
of
the
house
be
gradually
give
the
proper
air
of
confusion
by
a
grand
piano
-
forte
and
a
harp
,
flower
-
stand
and
little
table
place
in
every
direction
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
could
the
original
of
the
portrait
against
the
wainscot
,
could
the
gentleman
in
brown
velvet
and
the
lady
in
blue
satin
have
see
what
be
go
on
,
have
be
conscious
of
such
an
overthrow
of
all
order
and
neatness
!
<EOS>
the
portrait
themselves
seem
to
be
stare
in
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
the
Musgroves
,
like
their
house
,
be
in
a
state
of
alteration
,
perhaps
of
improvement
.
<EOS>
the
father
and
mother
be
in
the
old
english
style
,
and
the
young
people
in
the
new
.
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
be
a
very
good
sort
of
people
;
friendly
and
hospitable
,
not
much
educate
,
and
not
at
all
elegant
.
<EOS>
Their
child
have
more
modern
mind
and
manner
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
numerous
family
;
but
the
only
two
grow
up
,
except
Charles
,
be
Henrietta
and
Louisa
,
young
lady
of
nineteen
and
twenty
,
who
have
bring
from
school
at
Exeter
all
the
usual
stock
of
accomplishment
,
and
be
now
like
thousand
of
other
young
lady
,
live
to
be
fashionable
,
happy
,
and
merry
.
<EOS>
Their
dress
have
every
advantage
,
their
face
be
rather
pretty
,
their
spirit
extremely
good
,
their
manner
unembarrassed
and
pleasant
;
they
be
of
consequence
at
home
,
and
favourite
abroad
.
<EOS>
Anne
always
contemplate
them
as
some
of
the
happy
creature
of
her
acquaintance
;
but
still
,
save
as
we
all
be
,
by
some
comfortable
feeling
of
superiority
from
wish
for
the
possibility
of
exchange
,
she
would
not
have
give
up
her
own
more
elegant
and
cultivated
mind
for
all
their
enjoyment
;
and
envy
them
nothing
but
that
seemingly
perfect
good
understanding
and
agreement
together
,
that
good
-
humoured
mutual
affection
,
of
which
she
have
know
so
little
herself
with
either
of
her
sister
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
receive
with
great
cordiality
.
<EOS>
nothing
seem
amiss
on
the
side
of
the
Great
House
family
,
which
be
generally
,
as
Anne
very
well
know
,
the
least
to
blame
.
<EOS>
the
half
hour
be
chat
away
pleasantly
enough
;
and
she
be
not
at
all
surprised
at
the
end
of
it
,
to
have
their
walk
party
join
by
both
the
Miss
Musgroves
,
at
Mary
's
particular
invitation
.
    
<EOS>
Anne
have
not
want
this
visit
to
Uppercross
,
to
learn
that
a
removal
from
one
set
of
people
to
another
,
though
at
a
distance
of
only
three
mile
,
will
often
include
a
total
change
of
conversation
,
opinion
,
and
idea
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
be
stay
there
before
,
without
be
strike
by
it
,
or
without
wish
that
other
Elliots
could
have
her
advantage
in
see
how
unknown
,
or
unconsidered
there
,
be
the
affair
which
at
Kellynch
Hall
be
treat
as
of
such
general
publicity
and
pervade
interest
;
yet
,
with
all
this
experience
,
she
believe
she
must
now
submit
to
feel
that
another
lesson
,
in
the
art
of
know
our
own
nothingness
beyond
our
own
circle
,
be
become
necessary
for
her
;
for
certainly
,
come
as
she
do
,
with
a
heart
full
of
the
subject
which
have
be
completely
occupy
both
house
in
Kellynch
for
many
week
,
she
have
expect
rather
more
curiosity
and
sympathy
than
she
find
in
the
separate
but
very
similar
remark
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
:
"
so
,
Miss
Anne
,
Sir
Walter
and
your
sister
be
go
;
and
what
part
of
Bath
do
you
think
they
will
settle
in
?
"
<EOS>
and
this
,
without
much
wait
for
an
answer
;
or
in
the
young
lady
'
addition
of
,
"
I
hope
we
shall
be
in
Bath
in
the
winter
;
but
remember
,
papa
,
if
we
do
go
,
we
must
be
in
a
good
situation
:
none
of
your
Queen
Squares
for
us
!
"
<EOS>
or
in
the
anxious
supplement
from
Mary
,
of
 
"
upon
my
word
,
I
shall
be
pretty
well
off
,
when
you
be
all
go
away
to
be
happy
at
Bath
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
could
only
resolve
to
avoid
such
self
-
delusion
in
future
,
and
think
with
heighten
gratitude
of
the
extraordinary
blessing
of
have
one
such
truly
sympathise
friend
as
Lady
Russell
.
  
<EOS>
the
Mr
Musgroves
have
their
own
game
to
guard
,
and
to
destroy
,
their
own
horse
,
dog
,
and
newspaper
to
engage
them
,
and
the
female
be
fully
occupy
in
all
the
other
common
subject
of
housekeeping
,
neighbour
,
dress
,
dancing
,
and
music
.
<EOS>
She
acknowledge
it
to
be
very
fitting
,
that
every
little
social
commonwealth
should
dictate
its
own
matter
of
discourse
;
and
hope
,
ere
long
,
to
become
a
not
unworthy
member
of
the
one
she
be
now
transplant
into

with
the
prospect
of
spending
at

two
month
at
Uppercross

it

highly
incumbent

to
clothe
her
imagination
,
her
memory
,
and
all
her
idea
in
as
much
of
Uppercross
as
possible

<EOS>
She

no

of
these
two
month

<EOS>
Mary
be
not
so
repulsive
and
unsisterly
as
Elizabeth

nor
so
inaccessible
to
all
influence
of
her
;
neither
be
there
anything
among
the
other

the
cottage
inimical
to
comfort

<EOS>
She
be
always
on
friendly

with
her
brother

law

and
in
the
child

who
love
her
nearly

well

respect
her
a

<EOS>
Charles
Musgrove
be
civil
and
agreeable
;
in
sense
and
temper
he
be
undoubtedly
superior
to
his
wife
,
but
not
of
power
,
or
conversation
,
or
grace
,
to
make
the
past
,
as
they
be
connect
together
,
at
all
a
dangerous
contemplation
;
though
,
at
the
same
time
,
Anne
could
believe
,
with
Lady
Russell
,
that
a
more
equal
match
may
have
greatly
improve
him
;
and
that
a
woman
of
real
understanding
may
have
give
more
consequence
to
his
character
,
and
more
usefulness
,
rationality
,
and
elegance
to
his
habit
and
pursuit
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
he
do
nothing
with
much
zeal

but
sport

and
his
time
be
otherwise
trifle
away
,
without
benefit
from
book

anything
else

<EOS>
He
have
very
good
spirit
,
which
never
seem
much
affect
by
his
wife
's
occasional
lowness
,
bear
with
her
unreasonableness
sometimes
to
Anne
's
admiration
,
and
upon
the
whole
,
though
there
be
very
often
a
little
disagreement
(
in
which
she
have
sometimes
more
share
than
she
wish
,
be
appeal
to
by
both
party
)
,
they
may
pass
for
a
happy
couple
.
<EOS>
They
be
always
perfectly
agree
in
the
want
of
more
money
,
and
a
strong
inclination
for
a
handsome
present
from
his
father
;
but
here
,
as
on
most
topic
,
he
have
the
superiority
,
for
while
Mary
think
it
a
great
shame
that
such
a
present
be
not
make
,
he
always
contend
for
his
father
's
have
many
other
use
for
his
money
,
and
a
right
to
spend
it
as
he
like

<EOS>
as
to
the
management
of
their
child
,
his
theory
be
much
well
than
his
wife

,
and
his
practice
not
so
bad

<EOS>
"
I
could
manage
them
very
well

if
it

for
Mary

interference

"
be
what
Anne
often
hear
him
say

have
a
good
deal
of
faith
in
;
but
when
listen
in
turn
to
Mary
's
reproach
of
"
Charles
spoil
the
child
so
that
I
can
not
get
them
into

she
never

very
true

<EOS>
one
of
the
least
agreeable
circumstance
of
her
residence
<EOS>
there
be
her
be
treat
with
too
much
confidence
by
all
party
,
and
be
too
much
in
the
secret
of
the
complaint
of
each
house
.
<EOS>
know
to
have
some
influence
with
her
sister
,
she
be
continually
request
,
or
at
least
receive
hint
to
exert
it
,
beyond
what
be
practicable

<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
could
persuade
Mary
not
to
be
always
fancy
herself
ill

be
Charles
's
language
;
and
,
in
an
unhappy
mood
,
thus
speak
Mary
:
"
I
do
believe
if
Charles
be
to
see
me
die
,
he
would
not
think
there
be
anything
the
matter
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
Anne
,
if
you
would
,
you
may
persuade
him
that
I
really
be
very
ill
 
<EOS>
a
great
deal
bad
than
I
ever
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
's
declaration
be
,
"
I
hate
send
the
child
to
the
Great
House
,
though
their
grandmamma
be
always
want
to
see
them
,
for
she
humour
and
indulge
them
to
such
a
degree
,
and
give
them
so
much
trash
and
sweet
thing
,
that
they
be
sure
to
come
back
sick
and
cross
for
the
rest
of
the
day
.
"
<EOS>
and
Mrs
Musgrove
take
the
first
opportunity
of
be
alone
with
Anne
,
to
say
,
"
oh
!
<EOS>
Miss
Anne
,
I
can
not
help
wish
Mrs
Charles
have
a
little
of
your
method
with
those
child
.
<EOS>
They
be
quite
different
creature
with
you
!
<EOS>
but
to
be
sure
,
in
general
they
be
so
spoilt
!
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
you
can
not
put
your
sister
in
the
way
of
manage
them
.
<EOS>
They
be
as
fine
healthy
child
as
ever
be
see
,
poor
little
dear
!
<EOS>
without
partiality
;
but
Mrs
Charles
know
no
more
how
they
should
be
treat
 
!
<EOS>
bless
me
!
<EOS>
how
troublesome
they
be
sometimes
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
Miss
Anne
,
it
prevent
my
wishing
to
see
them
at
our
house
so
often
as
I
otherwise
should
.
<EOS>
I
believe
Mrs
Charles
be
not
quite
pleased
with
my
not
invite
them
oftener
;
but
you
know
it
be
very
bad
to
have
child
with
one
that
one
be
obligate
to
be
check
every
moment
;
"
do
not
do
this
,
"
and
"
do
not
do
that
;
"
or
that
one
can
only
keep
in
tolerable
order
by
more
cake
than
be
good
for
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
have
this
communication
,
moreover
,
from
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Musgrove
think
all
her
servant
so
steady
,
that
it
would
be
high
treason
to
call
it
in
question
;
but
I
be
sure
,
without
exaggeration
,
that
her
upper
house
-
maid
and
laundry
-
maid
,
instead
of
be
in
their
business
,
be
gad
about
the
village
,
all
day
long
.
<EOS>
I
meet
them
wherever
I
go
;
and
I
declare
,
I
never
go
twice
into
my
nursery
without
see
something
of
them
.
<EOS>
if
Jemima
be
not
the
trusty
,
steady
creature
in
the
world
,
it
would
be
enough
to
spoil
her
;
for
she
tell
me
,
they
be
always
tempt
her
to
take
a
walk
with
them
.
"
<EOS>
and
on
Mrs
Musgrove
's
side
,
it
be
,
"
I
make
a
rule
of
never
interfere
in
any
of
my
daughter
-
in
-
law
's
concern
,
for
I
know
it
would
not
do
;
but
I
shall
tell
you
,
Miss
Anne
,
because
you
may
be
able
to
set
thing
to
right
,
that
I
have
no
very
good
opinion
of
Mrs
Charles
's
nursery
-
maid
:
I
hear
strange
story
of
her
;
she
be
always
upon
the
gad
;
and
from
my
own
knowledge
,
I
can
declare
,
she
be
such
a
fine
-
dress
lady
,
that
she
be
enough
to
ruin
any
servant
she
come
near
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Charles
quite
swear
by
her
,
I
know
<EOS>
;
but
I
just
give
you
this
hint
,
that
you
may
be
upon
the
watch
;
because
,
if
you
see
anything
amiss
,
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
mention
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
again
,
it
be
Mary
's
complaint
,
that
Mrs
Musgrove
be
very
apt
not
to
give
her
the
precedence
that
be
her
due
,
when
they
dine
at
the
Great
House
with
other
family
;
and
she
do
not
see
any
reason
why
she
be
to
be
consider
so
much
at
home
as
to
lose
her
place
.
<EOS>
and
one
day
when
Anne
be
walk
with
only
the
Musgroves
,
one
of
them
after
talk
of
rank
,
people
of
rank
,
and
jealousy
of
rank
,
say
,
"
I
have
no
scruple
of
observe
to
you
,
how
nonsensical
some
person
be
about
their
place
,
because
all
the
world
know
how
easy
and
indifferent
you
be
about
it
;
but
I
wish
anybody
could
give
Mary
a
hint
that
it
would
be
a
great
deal
better
if
she
be
not
so
very
tenacious
,
especially
if
she
would
not
be
always
put
herself
forward
to
take
place
of
mamma
.
<EOS>
nobody
doubt
her
right
to
have
precedence
of
mamma
,
but
it
would
be
more
become
in
her
not
to
be
always
insist
on
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
mamma
care
about
it
the
least
in
the
world
,
but
I
know
it
be
take
notice
of
by
many
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
how
be
Anne
to
set
all
these
matter
to
right
?
<EOS>
She
could
do
little
more
than
listen
patiently
,
soften
every
grievance
,
and
excuse
each
to
the
other
;
give
them
all
hint
of
the
forbearance
necessary
between
such
near
neighbour
,
and
make
those
hint
broad
which
be
mean
for
her
sister
's
benefit
.
  
<EOS>
in
all
other
respect
,
her
visit
begin
and
proceed
very
well
.
<EOS>
Her
own
spirit
improve
by
change
of
place
and
subject
,
by
be
remove
three
mile
from
Kellynch
;
Mary
's
ailment
lessen
by
have
a
constant
companion
,
and
their
daily
intercourse
with
the
other
family
,
since
there
be
neither
superior
affection
,
confidence
,
nor
employment
in
the
cottage
,
to
be
interrupt
by
it
,
be
rather
an
advantage
.
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
carry
nearly
as
far
as
possible
,
for
they
meet
every
morning
,
and
hardly
ever
spend
an
evening
asunder
;
but
she
believe
they
should
not
have
do
so
well
without
the
sight
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
's
respectable
form
in
the
usual
place
,
or
without
the
talking
,
laugh
,
and
singing
of
their
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
She
play
a
great
deal
well
than
either
of
the
Miss
Musgroves
,
but
have
no
voice
,
no
knowledge
of
the
harp
,
and
no
fond
parent
,
to
sit
by
and
fancy
themselves
delight
,
her
performance
be
little
thought
of
,
only
out
of
civility
,
or
to
refresh
the
other
,
as
she
be
well
aware
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
when
she
play
she
be
give
pleasure
only
to
herself
;
but
this
be
no
new
sensation
.
<EOS>
except
one
short
period
of
her
life
,
she
have
never
,
since
the
age
of
fourteen
,
never
since
the
loss
of
her
dear
mother
,
know
the
happiness
of
be
listen
to
,
or
encourage
by
any
just
appreciation
or
real
taste
.
<EOS>
in
music
she
have
be
always
use
to
feel
alone
in
the
world
;
and
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
's
fond
partiality
for
their
own
daughter
'
performance
,
and
total
indifference
to
any
other
person
's
,
give
her
much
more
pleasure
for
their
sake
,
than
mortification
for
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
the
party
at
the
Great
House
be
sometimes
increase
by
other
company
.
<EOS>
the
neighbourhood
be
not
large
,
but
the
Musgroves
be
visit
by
everybody
,
and
have
more
dinner
-
party
,
and
more
caller
,
more
visitor
by
invitation
and
by
chance
,
than
any
other
family
.
<EOS>
They
be
more
completely
popular
.
  
<EOS>
the
girl
be
wild
for
dance
;
and
the
evening
end
,
occasionally
,
in
an
unpremeditated
little
ball
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
family
of
cousin
within
a
walk
of
Uppercross
,
in
less
affluent
circumstance
,
who
depend
on
the
Musgroves
for
all
their
pleasure
:
they
would
come
at
any
time
,
and
help
play
at
anything
,
or
dance
anywhere
;
and
Anne
,
very
much
prefer
the
office
of
musician
to
a
more
active
post
,
played
country
dance
to
them
by
the
hour
together
;
a
kindness
which
always
recommend
her
musical
power
to
the
notice
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
more
than
anything
else
,
and
often
draw
this
compliment
;
 
"
well
do
,
Miss
Anne
!
<EOS>
very
well
do
indeed
!
<EOS>
Lord
bless
me
!
<EOS>
how
those
little
finger
of
yours
fly
about
!
"
  
<EOS>
so
pass
the
first
three
week
.
<EOS>
Michaelmas
come
;
and
now
Anne
's
heart
must
be
in
Kellynch
again
.
<EOS>
a
beloved
home
make
over
to
other
;
all
the
precious
room
and
furniture
,
grove
,
and
prospect
,
begin
to
own
other
eye
and
other
limb
!
<EOS>
She
could
not
think
of
much
else
on
the
29th
of
September
;
and
she
have
this
sympathetic
touch
in
the
evening
from
Mary
,
who
,
on
have
occasion
to
note
down
the
day
of
the
month
,
exclaim
,
"
dear
me
,
be
not
this
the
day
the
Crofts
be
to
come
to
Kellynch
?
<EOS>
I
be
glad
I
do
not
think
of
it
before
.
<EOS>
how
low
it
make
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
Crofts
take
possession
with
true
naval
alertness
,
and
be
to
be
visit
.
<EOS>
Mary
deplore
the
necessity
for
herself
.
<EOS>
"
nobody
know
how
much
she
should
suffer
.
<EOS>
She
should
put
it
off
as
long
as
she
could
;
"
but
be
not
easy
till
she
have
talk
Charles
into
drive
her
over
on
an
early
day
,
and
be
in
a
very
animated
,
comfortable
state
of
imaginary
agitation
,
when
she
come
back
.
<EOS>
Anne
have
very
sincerely
rejoice
in
there
be
no
means
of
her
going
.
<EOS>
She
wish
,
however
to
see
the
Crofts
,
and
be
glad
to
be
within
when
the
visit
be
return
.
<EOS>
They
come
:
the
master
of
the
house
be
not
at
home
,
but
the
two
sister
be
together
;
and
as
it
chance
that
Mrs
Croft
fall
to
the
share
of
Anne
,
while
the
Admiral
sit
by
Mary
,
and
make
himself
very
agreeable
by
his
good
-
humoured
notice
of
her
little
boy
,
she
be
well
able
to
watch
for
a
likeness
,
and
if
it
fail
her
in
the
feature
,
to
catch
it
in
the
voice
,
or
in
the
turn
of
sentiment
and
expression
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Croft
,
though
neither
tall
nor
fat
,
have
a
squareness
,
uprightness
,
and
vigour
of
form
,
which
give
importance
to
her
person
.
<EOS>
She
have
bright
dark
eye
,
good
tooth
,
and
altogether
an
agreeable
face
;
though
her
reddened
and
weather
-
beat
complexion
,
the
consequence
of
her
have
be
almost
as
much
at
sea
as
her
husband
,
make
her
seem
to
have
live
some
year
longer
in
the
world
than
her
real
eight
-
and
-
thirty
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
be
open
,
easy
,
and
decide
,
like
one
who
have
no
distrust
of
herself
,
and
no
doubt
of
what
to
do
;
without
any
approach
to
coarseness
,
however
,
or
any
want
of
good
humour
.
<EOS>
Anne
give
her
credit
,
indeed
,
for
feeling
of
great
consideration
towards
herself
,
in
all
that
relate
to
Kellynch
,
and
it
please
her
:
especially
,
as
she
have
satisfy
herself
in
the
very
first
half
minute
,
in
the
instant
even
of
introduction
,
that
there
be
not
the
small
symptom
of
any
knowledge
or
suspicion
on
Mrs
Croft
's
side
,
to
give
a
bias
of
any
sort
.
<EOS>
She
be
quite
easy
on
that
head
,
and
consequently
full
of
strength
and
courage
,
till
for
a
moment
electrify
by
Mrs
Croft
's
suddenly
say
,
    
<EOS>
"
It
be
you
,
and
not
your
sister
,
I
find
,
that
my
brother
have
the
pleasure
of
be
acquaint
with
,
when
he
be
in
this
country
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
hope
she
have
outlive
the
age
of
blush
;
but
the
age
of
emotion
she
certainly
have
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
may
not
have
hear
that
he
be
married
?
"
add
Mrs
Croft
.
  
<EOS>
She
could
now
answer
as
she
ought
;
and
be
happy
to
feel
,
when
Mrs
Croft
's
next
word
explain
it
to
be
Mr
Wentworth
of
whom
she
speak
,
that
she
have
say
nothing
which
may
not
do
for
either
brother
.
<EOS>
She
immediately
feel
how
reasonable
it
be
,
that
Mrs
Croft
should
be
think
and
speak
of
Edward
,
and
not
of
Frederick
;
and
with
shame
at
her
own
forgetfulness
apply
herself
to
the
knowledge
of
their
former
neighbour
's
present
state
with
proper
interest
.
  
<EOS>
the
rest
be
all
tranquillity
;
till
,
just
as
they
be
move
,
she
hear
the
Admiral
say
to
Mary
    
<EOS>
"
We
be
expect
a
brother
of
Mrs
Croft
's
here
soon
;
I
dare
say
you
know
him
by
name
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
cut
short
by
the
eager
attack
of
the
little
boy
,
cling
to
him
like
an
old
friend
,
and
declare
he
should
not
go
;
and
be
too
much
engross
by
proposal
of
carry
them
away
in
his
coat
pocket
,
&
c.
,
to
have
another
moment
for
finish
or
recollect
what
he
have
begin
,
Anne
be
leave
to
persuade
herself
,
as
well
as
she
could
,
that
the
same
brother
must
still
be
in
question
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
,
however
,
reach
such
a
degree
of
certainty
,
as
not
to
be
anxious
to
hear
whether
anything
have
be
say
on
the
subject
at
the
other
house
,
where
the
Crofts
have
previously
be
call
.
  
<EOS>
the
folk
of
the
Great
House
be
to
spend
the
evening
of
this
day
at
the
Cottage
;
and
it
be
now
too
late
in
the
year
for
such
visit
to
be
make
on
foot
,
the
coach
be
begin
to
be
listen
for
,
when
the
young
Miss
Musgrove
walk
in
.
<EOS>
that
she
be
come
to
apologize
,
and
that
they
should
have
to
spend
the
evening
by
themselves
,
be
the
first
black
idea
;
and
Mary
be
quite
ready
to
be
affront
,
when
Louisa
make
all
right
by
say
,
that
she
only
come
on
foot
,
to
leave
more
room
for
the
harp
,
which
be
bring
in
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
will
tell
you
our
reason
,
"
she
add
,
"
and
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
come
on
to
give
you
notice
,
that
papa
and
mamma
be
out
of
spirit
this
evening
,
especially
mamma
;
she
be
think
so
much
of
poor
Richard
!
<EOS>
and
we
agree
it
would
be
good
to
have
the
harp
,
for
it
seem
to
amuse
her
more
than
the
piano
-
forte
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
why
she
be
out
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
when
the
Crofts
call
this
morning
,
(
they
call
here
afterwards
,
do
not
they
?
)
,
they
happen
to
say
,
that
her
brother
,
Captain
Wentworth
,
be
just
return
to
England
,
or
pay
off
,
or
something
,
and
be
come
to
see
them
almost
directly
;
and
most
unluckily
it
come
into
mamma
's
head
,
when
they
be
go
,
that
Wentworth
,
or
something
very
like
it
,
be
the
name
of
poor
Richard
's
captain
at
one
time
;
I
do
not
know
when
or
where
,
but
a
great
while
before
he
die
,
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
and
upon
look
over
his
letter
and
thing
,
she
find
it
be
so
,
and
be
perfectly
sure
that
this
must
be
the
very
man
,
and
her
head
be
quite
full
of
it
,
and
of
poor
Richard
!
<EOS>
so
we
must
be
as
merry
as
we
can
,
that
she
may
not
be
dwell
upon
such
gloomy
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
real
circumstance
of
this
pathetic
piece
of
family
history
be
,
that
the
Musgroves
have
have
the
ill
fortune
of
a
very
troublesome
,
hopeless
son
;
and
the
good
fortune
to
lose
him
before
he
reach
his
twentieth
year
;
that
he
have
be
send
to
sea
because
he
be
stupid
and
unmanageable
on
shore
;
that
he
have
be
very
little
cared
for
at
any
time
by
his
family
,
though
quite
as
much
as
he
deserve
;
seldom
hear
of
,
and
scarcely
at
all
regret
,
when
the
intelligence
of
his
death
abroad
have
work
its
way
to
Uppercross
,
two
year
before
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
,
in
fact
,
though
his
sister
be
now
do
all
they
could
for
him
,
by
call
him
"
poor
Richard
,
"
be
nothing
well
than
a
thick
-
headed
,
unfeeling
,
unprofitable
Dick
Musgrove
,
who
have
never
do
anything
to
entitle
himself
to
more
than
the
abbreviation
of
his
name
,
living
or
dead
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
be
several
year
at
sea
,
and
have
,
in
the
course
of
those
removal
to
which
all
midshipman
be
liable
,
and
especially
such
midshipman
as
every
captain
wish
to
get
rid
of
,
be
six
month
on
board
Captain
Frederick
Wentworth
's
frigate
,
the
Laconia
;
and
from
the
Laconia
he
have
,
under
the
influence
of
his
captain
,
write
the
only
two
letter
which
his
father
and
mother
have
ever
receive
from
him
during
the
whole
of
his
absence
;
that
be
to
say
,
the
only
two
disinterested
letter
;
all
the
rest
have
be
mere
application
for
money
.
  
<EOS>
in
each
letter
he
have
speak
well
of
his
captain
;
but
yet
,
so
little
be
they
in
the
habit
of
attend
to
such
matter
,
<EOS>
so
unobservant
and
incurious
be
they
as
to
the
name
of
man
or
ship
,
that
it
have
make
scarcely
any
impression
at
the
time
;
and
that
Mrs
Musgrove
should
have
be
suddenly
strike
,
this
very
day
,
with
a
recollection
of
the
name
of
Wentworth
,
as
connect
with
her
son
,
seem
one
of
those
extraordinary
burst
of
mind
which
do
sometimes
occur
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
go
to
her
letter
,
and
find
it
all
as
she
suppose
;
and
the
re
-
perusal
of
these
letter
,
after
so
long
an
interval
,
her
poor
son
go
for
ever
,
and
all
the
strength
of
his
fault
forget
,
have
affect
her
spirit
exceedingly
,
and
throw
her
into
great
grief
for
him
than
she
have
know
on
first
hearing
of
his
death
.
<EOS>
Mr
Musgrove
be
,
in
a
less
degree
,
affect
likewise
;
and
when
they
reach
the
cottage
,
they
be
evidently
in
want
,
first
,
of
be
listen
to
anew
on
this
subject
,
and
afterwards
,
of
all
the
relief
which
cheerful
companion
could
give
them
.
  
<EOS>
to
hear
them
talk
so
much
of
Captain
Wentworth
,
repeat
his
name
so
often
,
puzzle
over
past
year
,
and
at
last
ascertaining
that
it
may
,
that
it
probably
would
,
turn
out
to
be
the
very
same
Captain
Wentworth
whom
they
recollect
meeting
,
once
or
twice
,
after
their
come
back
from
Clifton
 
<EOS>
a
very
fine
young
man
 
<EOS>
but
they
could
not
say
whether
it
be
seven
or
eight
year
ago
<EOS>
,
be
a
new
sort
of
trial
to
Anne
's
nerve
.
<EOS>
She
find
,
however
,
that
it
be
one
to
which
she
must
inure
herself
.
<EOS>
since
he
actually
be
expect
in
the
country
,
she
must
teach
herself
to
be
insensible
on
such
point
.
<EOS>
and
not
only
do
it
appear
that
he
be
expect
,
and
speedily
,
but
the
Musgroves
,
in
their
warm
gratitude
for
the
kindness
he
have
shew
poor
Dick
,
and
very
high
respect
for
his
character
,
stamp
as
it
be
by
poor
Dick
's
have
be
six
month
under
his
care
,
and
mention
him
in
strong
,
though
not
perfectly
well
-
spelt
praise
,
as
"
a
fine
dashing
felow
,
only
two
perticular
about
the
schoolmaster
,
"
be
bent
on
introduce
themselves
,
and
seek
his
acquaintance
,
as
soon
as
they
could
hear
of
his
arrival
.
  
<EOS>
the
resolution
of
do
so
help
to
form
the
comfort
of
their
evening
.
    
<EOS>
a
very
few
day
more
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
be
know
to
be
at
Kellynch
,
and
Mr
Musgrove
have
call
on
him
,
and
come
back
warm
in
his
praise
,
and
he
be
engage
with
the
Crofts
to
dine
at
Uppercross
,
by
the
end
of
another
week
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
a
great
disappointment
to
Mr
Musgrove
to
find
that
no
early
day
could
be
fix
,
so
impatient
be
he
to
shew
his
gratitude
,
by
see
Captain
Wentworth
under
his
own
roof
,
and
welcome
him
to
all
that
be
strong
and
good
in
his
cellar
.
<EOS>
but
a
week
must
pass
;
only
a
week
,
in
Anne
's
reckoning
,
and
then
,
she
suppose
,
they
must
meet
;
and
soon
she
begin
to
wish
that
she
could
feel
secure
even
for
a
week
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
make
a
very
early
return
to
Mr
Musgrove
's
civility
,
and
she
be
all
but
call
there
in
the
same
half
hour
.
<EOS>
She
and
Mary
be
actually
set
forward
for
the
Great
House
,
where
,
as
she
afterwards
learn
,
they
must
inevitably
have
find
him
,
when
they
be
stop
by
the
eld
boy
's
be
at
that
moment
bring
home
in
consequence
of
a
bad
fall
.
<EOS>
the
child
's
situation
put
the
visit
entirely
aside
;
but
she
could
not
hear
of
her
escape
with
indifference
,
even
in
the
midst
of
the
serious
anxiety
which
they
afterwards
feel
on
his
account
.
  
<EOS>
His
collar
-
bone
be
find
to
be
dislocate
,
and
such
injury
receive
in
the
back
,
as
rouse
the
most
alarming
idea
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
afternoon
of
distress
,
and
Anne
have
every
thing
to
do
at
once
;
the
apothecary
to
send
for
,
the
father
to
have
pursue
and
inform
,
the
mother
to
support
and
keep
from
hysteric
,
the
servant
to
control
,
the
young
child
to
banish
,
and
the
poor
suffer
one
to
attend
and
soothe
;
besides
send
,
as
soon
as
she
recollect
it
,
proper
notice
to
the
other
house
,
which
bring
her
an
accession
rather
of
frightened
,
enquire
companion
,
than
of
very
useful
assistant
.
  
<EOS>
Her
brother
's
return
be
the
first
comfort
;
he
could
take
good
care
of
his
wife
;
and
the
second
blessing
be
the
arrival
of
the
apothecary
.
<EOS>
till
he
come
and
have
examine
the
child
,
their
apprehension
be
the
bad
for
be
vague
;
they
suspect
great
injury
,
but
know
not
where
;
but
now
the
collar
-
bone
be
soon
replace
,
and
though
Mr
Robinson
feel
and
feel
,
and
rub
,
and
look
grave
,
and
speak
low
word
both
to
the
father
and
the
aunt
,
still
they
be
all
to
hope
the
good
,
and
to
be
able
to
part
and
eat
their
dinner
in
tolerable
ease
of
mind
;
and
then
it
be
,
just
before
they
part
,
that
the
two
young
aunt
be
able
so
far
to
digress
from
their
nephew
's
state
,
as
to
give
the
information
of
Captain
Wentworth
's
visit
;
stay
five
minute
behind
their
father
and
mother
,
to
endeavour
to
express
how
perfectly
delighted
they
be
with
him
<EOS>
,
how
much
handsomer
,
how
infinitely
more
agreeable
they
think
him
than
any
individual
among
their
male
acquaintance
,
who
have
be
at
all
a
favourite
before
.
<EOS>
how
glad
they
have
be
to
hear
papa
invite
him
to
stay
dinner
,
how
sorry
when
he
say
it
be
quite
out
of
his
power
,
and
how
glad
again
when
he
have
promise
in
reply
to
papa
and
mamma
's
farther
press
invitation
to
come
and
dine
with
them
on
the
morrow
 
actually
on
the
morrow
;
and
he
have
promise
it
in
so
pleasant
a
manner
,
as
if
he
feel
all
the
motive
of
their
attention
just
as
he
ought
.
<EOS>
and
in
short
,
he
have
look
and
say
everything
with
such
exquisite
grace
,
that
they
could
assure
them
all
,
their
head
be
both
turn
by
him
;
and
off
they
run
,
quite
as
full
of
glee
as
of
love
,
and
apparently
more
full
of
Captain
Wentworth
than
of
little
Charles
.
  
<EOS>
the
same
story
and
the
same
rapture
be
repeat
,
when
the
two
girl
come
with
their
father
,
through
the
gloom
of
the
evening
,
to
make
enquiry
;
and
Mr
Musgrove
,
no
longer
under
the
first
uneasiness
about
his
heir
,
could
add
his
confirmation
and
praise
,
and
hope
there
would
be
now
no
occasion
for
put
Captain
Wentworth
off
,
and
only
be
sorry
to
think
that
the
cottage
party
,
probably
,
would
not
like
to
leave
the
little
boy
,
to
give
him
the
meeting
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
no
;
as
to
leave
the
little
boy
,
"
both
father
and
mother
be
in
much
too
strong
and
recent
alarm
to
bear
the
thought
;
and
Anne
,
in
the
joy
of
the
escape
,
could
not
help
add
her
warm
protestation
to
theirs
.
  
<EOS>
Charles
Musgrove
,
indeed
,
afterwards
,
shew
more
of
inclination
;
"
the
child
be
go
on
so
well
,
and
he
wish
so
much
to
be
introduce
to
Captain
Wentworth
,
that
,
perhaps
,
he
may
join
them
in
the
evening
;
he
would
not
dine
from
home
,
but
he
may
walk
in
for
half
an
hour
.
"
<EOS>
but
in
this
he
be
eagerly
oppose
by
his
wife
,
with
"
<EOS>
oh
!
no
,
indeed
,
Charles
,
I
can
not
bear
to
have
you
go
away
.
<EOS>
only
think
if
anything
should
happen
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
child
have
a
good
night
,
and
be
go
on
well
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
a
work
of
time
to
ascertain
that
no
injury
have
be
do
to
the
spine
;
but
Mr
Robinson
find
nothing
to
increase
alarm
,
and
Charles
Musgrove
begin
,
consequently
,
to
feel
no
necessity
for
long
confinement
.
<EOS>
the
child
be
to
be
keep
in
bed
and
amuse
as
quietly
as
possible
;
but
what
be
there
for
a
father
to
do
?
<EOS>
this
be
quite
a
female
case
,
and
it
would
be
highly
absurd
in
him
,
who
could
be
of
no
use
at
home
,
to
shut
himself
up
.
<EOS>
His
father
very
much
wish
him
to
meet
Captain
Wentworth
,
and
there
be
no
sufficient
reason
against
it
,
he
ought
to
go
;
and
it
end
in
his
make
a
bold
,
public
declaration
,
when
he
come
in
from
shooting
,
of
his
meaning
to
dress
directly
,
and
dine
at
the
other
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
can
be
go
on
better
than
the
child
,
"
say
he
;
"
so
I
tell
my
father
,
just
now
,
that
I
would
come
,
and
he
think
me
quite
right
.
<EOS>
Your
sister
be
with
you
,
my
love
,
I
have
no
scruple
at
all
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
like
to
leave
him
yourself
,
but
you
see
I
can
be
of
no
use
.
<EOS>
Anne
will
send
for
me
if
anything
be
the
matter
.
"
  
<EOS>
husband
and
wife
generally
understand
when
opposition
will
be
vain
.
<EOS>
Mary
know
,
from
Charles
's
manner
of
speaking
,
that
he
be
quite
determined
on
go
,
and
that
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
teaze
him
.
<EOS>
She
say
nothing
,
therefore
,
till
he
be
out
of
the
room
,
but
as
soon
as
there
be
only
Anne
to
hear
    
"
so
you
and
I
be
to
be
leave
to
shift
by
ourselves
,
with
this
poor
sick
child
;
and
not
a
creature
come
near
us
all
the
evening
!
<EOS>
I
know
how
it
would
be
.
<EOS>
this
be
always
my
luck
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
anything
disagreeable
go
on
man
be
always
sure
to
get
out
of
it
,
and
Charles
be
as
bad
as
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
very
unfeeling
!
<EOS>
I
must
say
it
be
very
unfeeling
of
him
to
be
run
away
from
his
poor
little
boy
.
<EOS>
talk
of
his
be
go
on
so
well
!
<EOS>
how
do
he
know
that
he
be
go
on
well
,
or
that
there
may
not
be
a
sudden
change
half
an
hour
hence
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
Charles
would
have
be
so
unfeeling
.
<EOS>
so
here
he
be
to
go
away
and
enjoy
himself
,
and
because
I
be
the
poor
mother
,
I
be
not
to
be
allow
to
stir
;
and
yet
,
I
be
sure
<EOS>
,
I
be
more
unfit
than
anybody
else
to
be
about
the
child
.
<EOS>
My
be
the
mother
be
the
very
reason
why
my
feeling
should
not
be
try
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
at
all
equal
to
it
.
<EOS>
You
see
how
hysterical
I
be
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
that
be
only
the
effect
of
the
suddenness
of
your
alarm
 
of
the
shock
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
be
hysterical
again
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
we
shall
have
nothing
to
distress
us
.
<EOS>
I
perfectly
understand
Mr
Robinson
's
direction
,
and
have
no
fear
;
and
indeed
,
Mary
,
I
can
not
wonder
at
your
husband
.
<EOS>
nursing
do
not
belong
to
a
man
;
it
be
not
his
province
.
<EOS>
a
sick
child
be
always
the
mother
's
property
:
her
own
feeling
generally
make
it
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
be
as
fond
of
my
child
as
any
mother
,
but
I
do
not
know
that
I
be
of
any
more
use
in
the
sick
-
room
than
Charles
,
for
I
can
not
be
always
scold
and
teaze
the
poor
child
when
it
be
ill
;
and
you
see
,
this
morning
,
that
if
I
tell
him
to
keep
quiet
,
he
be
sure
to
begin
kick
about
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
nerve
for
the
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
could
you
be
comfortable
yourself
,
to
be
spend
the
whole
evening
away
from
the
poor
boy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
you
see
his
papa
can
,
and
why
should
not
I
?
<EOS>
Jemima
be
so
careful
;
and
she
could
send
us
word
every
hour
how
he
be
.
<EOS>
I
really
think
Charles
may
as
well
have
tell
his
father
we
would
all
come
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
more
alarmed
about
little
Charles
now
than
he
be
.
<EOS>
I
be
dreadfully
alarm
yesterday
,
but
the
case
be
very
different
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
if
you
do
not
think
it
too
late
to
give
notice
for
yourself
,
suppose
you
be
to
go
,
as
well
as
your
husband
.
<EOS>
leave
little
Charles
to
my
care
.
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
can
not
think
it
wrong
while
I
remain
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
serious
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Mary
,
her
eye
brighten
.
<EOS>
"
dear
me
!
<EOS>
that
be
a
very
good
thought
,
very
good
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
I
may
just
as
well
go
as
not
,
for
I
be
of
no
use
at
home
 
<EOS>
be
I
?
<EOS>
and
it
only
harass
me
.
<EOS>
You
,
who
have
not
a
mother
's
feeling
,
be
a
great
deal
the
proper
person
.
<EOS>
You
can
make
little
Charles
do
anything
;
he
always
mind
you
at
a
word
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
great
deal
better
than
leave
him
only
with
Jemima
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
shall
certainly
go
;
I
be
sure
I
ought
if
I
can
,
quite
as
much
as
Charles
,
for
they
want
me
excessively
to
be
acquaint
with
Captain
Wentworth
,
and
I
know
you
do
not
mind
be
leave
alone
.
<EOS>
an
excellent
thought
of
yours
,
indeed
,
Anne
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
and
tell
Charles
,
and
get
ready
directly
.
<EOS>
You
can
send
for
us
,
you
know
,
at
a
moment
's
notice
,
if
anything
be
the
matter
;
but
I
dare
say
there
will
be
nothing
to
alarm
you
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
go
,
you
may
be
sure
,
if
I
do
not
feel
quite
at
ease
about
my
dear
child
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
next
moment
she
be
tap
at
her
husband
's
dressing
-
room
door
,
and
as
Anne
follow
her
up
stair
,
she
be
in
time
for
the
whole
conversation
,
which
begin
with
Mary
's
say
,
in
a
tone
of
great
exultation
    
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
go
with
you
,
Charles

for
I
be
of
no
more
use
at
home
than
you
be
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
to
shut
myself
up
for
ever
with
the
child
,
I
should
not
be
able
to
persuade
him
to
do
anything
he
do
not
like
.
<EOS>
Anne
will
stay
;
Anne
undertake
to
stay
at
home
and
take
care
of
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
Anne
's
own
proposal
,
and
so
I
shall
go
with
you
,
which
will
be
a
great
deal
better
,
for
I
have
not
dine
at
the
other
house
since
Tuesday

"
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
very
kind
of
Anne

"
be
her
husband
's
answer
,
"
and
I
should
be
very
glad
to
have
you
go
;
but
it
seem
rather
hard
that
she
should
be
leave
at
home
by
herself
,
to
nurse
our
sick
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
be
now
at
hand
to
take
up
her
own
cause
,
and
the
sincerity
of
her
manner
be
soon
sufficient
to
convince
him
,
where
conviction
be
at
least
very
agreeable
,
he
have
no
farther
scruple
as
to
her
be
leave
to
dine
alone
,
though
he
still
want
her
to
join
them
in
the
evening
,
when
the
child
may
be
at
rest
for
the
night
,
and
kindly
urge
her
to
let
him
come
and
fetch
her
,
but
she
be
quite
unpersuadable
;
and
this
be
the
case
<EOS>
,
she
have
ere
long
the
pleasure
of
see
them
set
off
together
in
high
spirit
.
<EOS>
They
be
go
,
she
hope
,
to
be
happy
<EOS>

however
oddly
construct
such
happiness
may
seem

as
for
herself

she
be
leave
with
as
many
sensation
of
comfort
,
as
be
,
perhaps
,
ever
likely
to
be
hers
.
<EOS>
She
know
herself
to
be
of
the
first
utility
to
the
child
;
and
what
be
it
to
her
if
Frederick
Wentworth
be
only
half
a
mile
distant
,
make
himself
agreeable
to
other
?
  
<EOS>
She
would
have
like
to
know
how
he
feel
as
to
a
meeting
.
<EOS>
perhaps
indifferent
,
if
indifference
could
exist
under
such
circumstance
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
either
indifferent
or
unwilling
.
<EOS>
have
he
wish
ever
to
see
her
again
,
he
nee
not
have
wait
till
this
time
;
he
would
have
do
what
she
could
not
but
believe
that
in
his
place
she
should
have
do
long
ago
,
when
event
have
be
early
give
him
the
independence
which
alone
have
be
want

<EOS>
Her
brother
and
sister
come
back
delighted
with
their
new
acquaintance
,
and
their
visit
in
general
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
music
,
singe
,
talk
,
laugh
,
all
that
be
most
agreeable
;
charming
manner
in
Captain
Wentworth
,
no
shyness
or
reserve
;
they
seem
all
to
know
each
other
perfectly
,
and
he
be
come
the
very
next
morning
to
shoot
with
Charles
.
<EOS>
He
be
to
come
to
breakfast
,
but
not
at
the
Cottage
,
though
that
have
be
propose
at
first
;
but
then
he
have
be
press
to
come
to
the
Great
House
instead
,
and
he
seem
afraid
of
be
in
Mrs
Charles
Musgrove
's
way
,
on
account
of
the
child
,
and
therefore
,
somehow
,
they
hardly
know
how
,
it
end
in
Charles
's
be
to
meet
him
to
breakfast
at
his
father
's
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
understand
it
.
<EOS>
He
wish
to
avoid
see
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
inquire
after
her
,
she
find
,
slightly
,
as
may
suit
a
former
slight
acquaintance
,
seem
to
acknowledge
such
as
she
have
acknowledge
,
actuate
,
perhaps
,
by
the
same
view
of
escape
introduction
when
they
be
to
meet
.
  
<EOS>
the
morning
hour
of
the
Cottage
be
always
later
than
those
of
the
other
house
,
and
on
the
morrow
the
difference
be
so
great
that
Mary
and
Anne
be
not
more
than
begin
breakfast
when
Charles
come
in
to
say
that
they
be
just
set
off
,
that
he
be
come
for
his
dog
,
that
his
sister
be
follow
with
Captain
Wentworth
;
his
sister
mean
to
visit
Mary
and
the
child
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
propose
also
to
wait
on
her
for
a
few
minute
if
not
inconvenient
;
and
though
Charles
have
answer
for
the
child
's
be
in
no
such
state
as
could
make
it
inconvenient
,
Captain
Wentworth
would
not
be
satisfied
without
his
run
on
to
give
notice
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
,
very
much
gratify
by
this
attention
,
be
delighted
to
receive
him
,
while
a
thousand
feeling
rush
on
Anne
,
of
which
this
be
the
most
consoling
,
that
it
would
soon
be
over
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
soon
over
.
<EOS>
in
two
minute
after
Charles
's
preparation
,
the
other
appear
;
they
be
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
half
meet
Captain
Wentworth
's
,
a
bow
,
a
curtsey
pass
;
she
hear
his
voice
;
he
talk
to
Mary
,
say
all
that
be
right
,
say
something
to
the
Miss
Musgroves
,
enough
to
mark
an
easy
footing
;
the
room
seem
full
,
full
of
person
and
voice
,
but
a
few
minute
end
it
.
<EOS>
Charles
shew
himself
at
the
window
,
all
be
ready
,
their
visitor
have
bow
and
be
go
,
the
Miss
Musgroves
be
go
too
,
suddenly
resolve
to
walk
to
the
end
of
the
village
with
the
sportsman
:
the
room
be
clear
,
and
Anne
may
finish
her
breakfast
as
she
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
over
!
<EOS>
it
be
over
!
"
<EOS>
she
repeat
to
herself
again
and
again
,
in
nervous
gratitude
.
<EOS>
"
the
bad
be
over
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
talk
,
but
she
could
not
attend
.
<EOS>
She
have
see
him
.
<EOS>
They
have
meet
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
once
more
in
the
same
room
.
  
<EOS>
soon
,
however
,
she
begin
to
reason
with
herself
,
and
try
to
be
feel
less
.
<EOS>
eight
year
,
almost
eight
year
have
pass
,
since
all
have
be
give
up
.
<EOS>
how
absurd
to
be
resume
the
agitation
which
such
an
interval
have
banish
into
distance
and
indistinctness
!
<EOS>
what
may
not
eight
year
do
?
<EOS>
event
of
every
description
,
change
,
alienation
,
removal
 
all
,
all
must
be
comprise
in
it
,
and
oblivion
of
the
past
  
how
natural
,
how
certain
too
!
<EOS>
It
include
nearly
a
third
part
of
her
own
life
.
  
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
with
all
her
reasoning
,
she
find
,
that
to
retentive
feeling
eight
year
may
be
little
more
than
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
how
be
his
sentiment
to
be
read
?
<EOS>
be
this
like
wish
to
avoid
her
?
<EOS>
and
the
next
moment
she
be
hate
herself
for
the
folly
which
ask
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
on
one
other
question
which
perhaps
her
utmost
wisdom
may
not
have
prevent
,
she
be
soon
spare
all
suspense
;
for
,
after
the
Miss
Musgroves
have
return
and
finish
their
visit
at
the
Cottage
she
have
this
spontaneous
information
from
Mary
:
    
<EOS>
"
Captain
Wentworth
be
not
very
gallant
by
you
,
Anne
,
though
he
be
so
attentive
to
me
.
<EOS>
Henrietta
ask
him
what
he
think
of
you
,
when
they
go
away
,
and
he
say
,
"
You
be
so
altered
he
should
not
have
know
you
again
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
Mary
have
no
feeling
to
make
her
respect
her
sister
be
in
a
common
way
,
but
she
be
perfectly
unsuspicious
of
be
inflict
any
peculiar
wound
.
  
<EOS>
"
alter
beyond
his
knowledge
.
"
<EOS>
Anne
fully
submit
,
in
silent
,
deep
mortification
.
<EOS>
doubtless
it
be
so
,
and
she
could
take
no
revenge
,
for
he
be
not
alter
,
or
not
for
the
bad
.
<EOS>
She
have
already
acknowledge
it
to
herself
,
and
she
could
not
think
differently
,
let
him
think
of
her
as
he
would
.
<EOS>
no
:
<EOS>
the
year
which
have
destroy
her
youth
and
bloom
have
only
give
him
a
more
glowing
,
manly
,
open
look
,
in
no
respect
lessen
his
personal
advantage
.
<EOS>
She
have
see
the
same
Frederick
Wentworth
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
alter
that
he
should
not
have
know
her
again
!
"
<EOS>
these
be
word
which
could
not
but
dwell
with
her
.
<EOS>
yet
she
soon
begin
to
rejoice
that
she
have
hear
them
.
<EOS>
They
be
of
sober
tendency
;
they
allay
agitation
;
they
compose
,
and
consequently
must
make
her
happy
.
  
<EOS>
Frederick
Wentworth
have
use
such
word
,
or
something
like
them
,
but
without
an
idea
that
they
would
be
carry
round
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
think
her
wretchedly
alter
,
and
in
the
first
moment
of
appeal
,
have
speak
as
he
feel
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
forgive
Anne
Elliot
.
<EOS>
She
have
use
him
ill
,
desert
and
disappoint
him
;
and
bad
,
she
have
shew
a
feebleness
of
character
in
do
so
,
which
his
own
decided
,
confident
temper
could
not
endure
.
<EOS>
She
have
give
him
up
to
oblige
other
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
the
effect
of
over
-
persuasion
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
weakness
and
timidity
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
be
most
warmly
attach
to
her
,
and
have
never
see
a
woman
since
whom
he
think
her
equal
;
but
,
except
from
some
natural
sensation
of
curiosity
,
he
have
no
desire
of
meet
her
again
.
<EOS>
Her
power
with
him
be
go
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
his
object
to
marry
.
<EOS>
He
be
rich
,
and
be
turn
on
shore
,
fully
intend
to
settle
as
soon
as
he
could
be
properly
tempt
;
actually
look
round
,
ready
to
fall
in
love
with
all
the
speed
which
a
clear
head
and
a
quick
taste
could
allow
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
heart
for
either
of
the
Miss
Musgroves
,
if
they
could
catch
it
;
a
heart
,
in
short
,
for
any
pleasing
young
woman
who
come
in
his
way
,
except
Anne
Elliot
.
<EOS>
this
be
his
only
secret
exception
,
when
he
say
to
his
sister
,
in
answer
to
her
supposition
:
    
"
<EOS>
yes
,
here
I
be
,
Sophia
,
quite
ready
to
make
a
foolish
match
.
<EOS>
anybody
between
fifteen
and
thirty
may
have
me
for
ask
.
<EOS>
a
little
beauty
,
and
a
few
smile
,
and
a
few
compliment
to
the
navy
,
and
I
be
a
lost
man
.
<EOS>
Should
not
this
be
enough
for
a
sailor
,
who
have
have
no
society
among
woman
to
make
him
nice
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
say
it
,
she
know
,
to
be
contradict
.
<EOS>
His
bright
proud
eye
speak
the
conviction
that
he
be
nice
;
and
Anne
Elliot
be
not
out
of
his
thought
,
when
he
more
seriously
describe
the
woman
he
should
wish
to
meet
with
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
strong
mind
,
with
sweetness
of
manner
,
"
make
the
first
and
the
last
of
the
description
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
woman
I
want
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
something
a
little
inferior
I
shall
of
course
put
up
with
,
but
it
must
not
be
much
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
a
fool
,
I
shall
be
a
fool
indeed
,
for
I
have
think
on
the
subject
more
than
most
man
.
"
    
<EOS>
from
this
time
Captain
Wentworth
and
Anne
Elliot
be
repeatedly
in
the
same
circle
.
<EOS>
They
be
soon
dine
in
company
together
at
Mr
Musgrove
's
,
for
the
little
boy
's
state
could
no
longer
supply
his
aunt
with
a
pretence
for
absent
herself
;
and
this
be
but
the
beginning
of
other
dining
and
other
meeting
.
  
<EOS>
whether
former
feeling
be
to
be
renew
must
be
bring
to
the
proof
;
former
time
must
undoubtedly
be
bring
to
the
recollection
of
each
;
they
could
not
but
be
revert
to
;
the
year
of
their
engagement
could
not
but
be
name
by
him
,
in
the
little
narrative
or
description
which
conversation
call
forth
.
<EOS>
His
profession
qualify
him
,
his
disposition
lead
him
,
to
talk
;
and
"
that
be
in
the
year
six
;
"
"
that
happen
before
I
go
to
sea
in
the
year
six
,
"
occur
in
the
course
of
the
first
evening
<EOS>
they
spend
together
:
and
though
his
voice
do
not
falter
,
and
though
she
have
no
reason
to
suppose
his
eye
wander
towards
her
while
he
speak
,
Anne
feel
the
utter
impossibility
,
from
her
knowledge
of
his
mind
,
that
he
could
be
unvisited
by
remembrance
any
more
than
herself
.
<EOS>
there
must
be
the
same
immediate
association
of
thought
,
though
she
be
very
far
from
conceive
it
to
be
of
equal
pain
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
no
conversation
together
,
no
intercourse
but
what
the
common
civility
require
.
<EOS>
once
so
much
to
each
other
!
<EOS>
now
nothing
!
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
time
,
when
of
all
the
large
party
now
fill
the
drawing
-
room
at
Uppercross
,
they
would
have
find
it
most
difficult
to
cease
to
speak
to
one
another
.
<EOS>
with
the
exception
,
perhaps
,
of
Admiral
and
Mrs
Croft
,
who
seem
particularly
attach
and
happy
,
(
Anne
could
allow
no
other
exception
even
among
the
married
couple
)
,
there
could
have
be
no
two
heart
so
open
,
no
taste
so
similar
,
no
feeling
so
in
unison
,
no
countenance
so
beloved
.
<EOS>
now
they
be
as
stranger
;
nay
,
bad
than
stranger
,
for
they
could
never
become
acquainted
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
perpetual
estrangement
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
talk
,
she
hear
the
same
voice
,
and
discern
the
same
mind
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
very
general
ignorance
of
all
naval
matter
throughout
the
party
;
and
he
be
very
much
question
,
and
especially
by
the
two
Miss
Musgroves
,
who
seem
hardly
to
have
any
eye
but
for
him
,
as
to
the
manner
of
live
on
board
,
daily
regulation
,
food
,
hour
,
&
c.
,
and
their
surprise
at
his
account
,
at
learn
the
degree
of
accommodation
and
arrangement
which
be
practicable
,
draw
from
him
some
pleasant
ridicule
,
which
remind
Anne
of
the
early
day
when
she
too
have
be
ignorant
,
and
she
too
have
be
accuse
of
suppose
sailor
to
be
live
on
board
without
anything
to
eat
,
or
any
cook
to
dress
it
if
there
be
,
or
any
servant
to
wait
,
or
any
knife
and
fork
to
use
.
  
<EOS>
from
thus
listen
and
think
,
she
be
rouse
by
a
whisper
of
Mrs
Musgrove
's
who
,
overcome
by
fond
regret
,
could
not
help
say
    
"
ah
!
<EOS>
Miss
Anne
,
if
it
have
please
Heaven
to
spare
my
poor
son
,
I
dare
say
he
would
have
be
just
such
another
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
suppress
a
smile
,
and
listen
kindly
,
while
Mrs
Musgrove
relieve
her
heart
a
little
more
;
and
for
a
few
minute
,
therefore
,
could
not
keep
pace
with
the
conversation
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
could
let
her
attention
take
its
natural
course
again
,
she
find
the
Miss
Musgroves
just
fetch
the
Navy
List
(
their
own
navy
list
,
the
first
that
have
ever
be
at
Uppercross
)
,
and
sit
down
together
to
pore
over
it
,
with
the
professed
view
of
find
out
the
ship
that
Captain
Wentworth
have
command
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
first
be
the
Asp
,
I
remember
;
we
will
look
for
the
Asp
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
find
her
there
.
<EOS>
quite
wear
out
and
break
up
.
<EOS>
I
be
the
last
man
who
command
her
.
<EOS>
hardly
fit
for
service
then
.
<EOS>
report
fit
for
home
service
for
a
year
or
two
,
and
<EOS>
so
I
be
send
off
to
the
West
Indies
.

"
  
<EOS>
the
girl
look
all
amazement

<EOS>
"
the
Admiralty

"
he
continue
,
"
entertain
themselves
now
and
then
,
with
send
a
few
hundred
man
to
sea
,
in
a
ship
not
fit
to
be
employ
.
<EOS>
but
they
have
a
great
many
to
provide
for
;
and
among
the
thousand
that
may
just
as
well
go
to
the
bottom
as
not
,
it
be
impossible
for
them
to
distinguish
the
very
set
who
may
be
least
miss
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Phoo
!
phoo
!
<EOS>
"
cry
the
Admiral
,
"
what
stuff
these
young
fellow
talk
!
<EOS>
never
be
a
well
sloop
than
the
Asp
in
her
day

<EOS>
for
an
old
build
sloop

you
would
not

her
equal

lucky

her
!

anything

soon

no

his

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
my
luck
,
Admiral

,
I
assure
you
;

reply
Captain
Wentworth
,
seriously
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
as
well
satisfied
with
my
appointment
as
you
can
desire
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
object
with
me
at
that
time
to
be
at
sea
;
a
very
great
object
,
I
want
to
be
do
something
.

"
  
"
to
be
sure
you
do
.
<EOS>
what
should
a
young
fellow
like
you
do
ashore
for
half
a
year
together
?
<EOS>
if
a
man
have
not
a
wife
,
he
soon
want
to
be
afloat
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Captain
Wentworth
,
"
cry
Louisa
,
"
how
vexed
you
must
have
be
when
you
come
to
the
Asp
,
to
see
what
an
old
thing
they
have
give
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
pretty
well
what
she
be
before
that
day
;
"
say
he
,
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
more
discovery
to
make
than
you
would
have
as
to
the
fashion
and
strength
of
any
old
pelisse
,
which
you
have
see
lend
about
among
half
your
acquaintance
ever
since
you
could
remember
,
and
which
at
last
,
on
some
very
wet
day
,
be
lend
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
she
be
a
dear
old
Asp
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
do
all
that
I
want
.
<EOS>
I
know
she
would
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
we
should
either
go
to
the
bottom
together
,
or
that
she
would
be
the
making
of
me
;
and
I
never
have
two
day
of
foul
weather
all
the
time
I
be
at
sea
in
her
;
and
after
take
privateer
enough
to
be
very
entertaining
,
I
have
the
good
luck
in
my
passage
home
the
next
autumn
,
to
fall
in
with
the
very
french
frigate
I
want
.
<EOS>
I
bring
her
into
Plymouth
;
and
here
another
instance
of
luck
.
<EOS>
We
have
not
be
six
hour
in
the
Sound
,
when
a
gale
come
on
,
which
last
four
day
and
night
,
and
which
would
have
do
for
poor
old
Asp
in
half
the
time
;
our
touch
with
the
Great
Nation
not
have
much
improve
our
condition
.
<EOS>
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
later
,
and
I
should
only
have
be
a
gallant
Captain
Wentworth
,
in
a
small
paragraph
at
one
corner
of
the
newspaper
;
and
be
lose
in
only
a
sloop
,
nobody
would
have
think
about
me

Anne
's
shuddering
be
to
herself
alone

but
the
Miss
Musgroves
could
be
as
open
as
they
be
sincere
,
in
their
exclamation
of
pity
and
horror

"
<EOS>
and
so
then
,
I
suppose

say
Mrs
Musgrove
,
in
a
low
voice
,
as

think
aloud

so
then

away

there
he
meet

poor
boy

ask

oh
!

but
,
Charles
,
tell
Captain
Wentworth
,
he
nee
not
be
afraid
of
mention
poor
Dick
before
me
,
for
it
would
be
rather
a
pleasure
to
hear
him
talk
of
by
such
a
good
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Charles
,
be
somewhat
more
mindful
of
the
probability
of
the
case
,
only
nod
in
reply
,
and
walk
away
.
  
<EOS>
the
girl
be
now
hunt
for
the
Laconia
;
and
Captain
Wentworth
could
not
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
take
the
precious
volume
into
his
own
hand
to
save
them
the
trouble
,
and
once
more
read
aloud
the
little
statement
of
her
name
and
rate
,
and
present
non
-
commissioned
class
,
observe
over
it
that
she
too
have
be
one
of
the
good
friend
man
ever
have
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
those
be
pleasant
day
when
I
have
the
Laconia
!
<EOS>
how
fast
I
make
money
in
her
.
<EOS>
a
friend
of
mine
<EOS>
and
I
have
such
a
lovely
cruise
together
off
the
Western
Islands
.
<EOS>
Poor
Harville
,
sister
!
<EOS>
You
know
how
much
he
want
money

bad
than
myself

He
have
a
wife

<EOS>
excellent
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
his
happiness
.
<EOS>
He
feel
it
all
,
so
much
for
her
sake
.
<EOS>
I
wish
for
him
again
the
next
summer
,
when
I
have
still
the
same
luck
in
the
Mediterranean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
be
sure
,
Sir
,
"
say
Mrs
Musgrove
,
"
it
be
a
lucky
day
for
us
,
when
you
be
put
captain
into
that
ship
.
<EOS>
We
shall
never
forget
what
you
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
feeling
make
her
speak
low
;
and
Captain
Wentworth
,
hear
only
in
part
,
and
probably
not
have
Dick
Musgrove
at
all
near
his
thought
,
look
rather
in
suspense
,
and
as
if
wait
for
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
brother
,
"
whisper
one
of
the
girl
;

mamma
be
think
of
poor
Richard

<EOS>
"
poor
dear
fellow
!

continue
Mrs
Musgrove
;

he
be
grow
so
steady
,

<EOS>
such
an
excellent
correspondent

while
he
be
under
your
care

<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
it
would
have
be
a
happy
thing

if

never
leave
you

I
assure
you
,
Captain
Wentworth
,
we
be
very
sorry
he
ever
leave
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
momentary
expression
in
Captain
Wentworth
's
face
at
this
speech
,
a
certain
glance
of
his
bright
eye
,
and
curl
of
his
handsome
mouth
,
which
convince
Anne
,
that
instead
of
share
in
Mrs
Musgrove
's
kind
wish
,
as
to
her
son
,
he
have
probably
be
at
some
pain
to
get
rid
of
him
;
but
it
be
too
transient
an
indulgence
of
self
-
amusement
to
be
detect
by
any
who
understand
him
less
than
herself
;
in
another
moment
he
be
perfectly
collect
and
serious
,
and
almost
instantly
afterwards
come
up
to
the
sofa
,
on
which
she
and
Mrs
Musgrove
be
sit
,
take
a
place
by
the
latter
,
and
enter
into
conversation
with

while
the

of
Anne

may

consider

Captain

personal

a

there

I

she

It

joyous
party

<EOS>
no

seem
in
high
spirit
than
Captain
Wentworth

She
feel
that
he
have
every
thing
to
elevate
him
which
general
attention
and
deference

the
attention

for

they
both
seem
so
entirely
occupy
by
him
,
that
nothing

the
continue
appearance
of
the
most
perfect
good

will
between
themselves
could
have
make
it
credible
that
they

rival

<EOS>
if
he
be
a

spoilt
by
such
universal
,
such
eager
admiration

who
could

these

for
half
an

her
altered
feature

perhaps
,
try
to
trace
in
them
the
ruin
of
the

charm
him

once
she
know

have
speak

she

the
answer
be
,
"

oh

no

never

she

She
have
leave

have
sit
down

make
out
an
air

he
wish
to
give
the
Miss

an
idea
of

she
return

part

see
her

instantly
rise

,
with
study
politeness

I
beg
your

down
again

not

such
look

His
cold
politeness
,
his
ceremonious
grace

be
bad
than
anything

<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
be
come
to
Kellynch
as
to
a
home
,
to
stay
as
long
as
he
like
,
be
as
thoroughly
the
object
of
the
Admiral
's
fraternal
kindness
as
of
his
wife
's
.
<EOS>
He
have
intend
,
on
first
arriving
,
to
proceed
very
soon
into
Shropshire
,
and
visit
the
brother
settle
in
that
country
,
but
the
attraction
of
Uppercross
induce
him
to
put
this
off
.
<EOS>
there
be
so
much
of
friendliness
,
and
of
flattery
,
and
of
everything
most
bewitching
in
his
reception
there
;
the
old
be
so
hospitable
,
the
young
so
agreeable
,
that
he
could
not
but
resolve
to
remain
where
he
be
,
and
take
all
the
charm
and
perfection
of
Edward
's
wife
upon
credit
a
little
long
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
soon
Uppercross
with
him
almost
every
day
.
<EOS>
the
Musgroves
could
hardly
be
more
ready
to
invite
than
he
to
come
,
particularly
in
the
morning
,
when
he
have
no
companion
at
home
,
for
the
Admiral
and
Mrs
Croft
<EOS>
be
generally
out
of
door
together
,
interesting
themselves
in
their
new
possession
,
their
grass
,
and
their
sheep
,
and
dawdle
about
in
a
way
not
endurable
to
a
third
person
,
or
drive
out
in
a
gig
,
lately
add
to
their
establishment
.
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
there
have
be
but
one
opinion
of
Captain
Wentworth
among
the
musgrove
and
their
dependency
.
<EOS>
It
be
unvarye
,
warm
admiration
everywhere
;
but
this
intimate
footing
be
not
more
than
establish
,
when
a
certain
Charles
Hayter
return
among
them
,
to
be
a
good
deal
disturb
by
it
,
and
to
think
Captain
Wentworth
very
much
in
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
Charles
Hayter
be
the
eld
of
all
the
cousin
,
and
a
very
amiable
,
pleasing
young
man
,
between
whom
and
Henrietta
there
have
be
a
considerable
appearance
of
attachment
previous
to
Captain
Wentworth
's
introduction
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
order
;
and
have
a
curacy
in
the
neighbourhood
,
where
residence
be
not
require
,
live
at
his
father
's
house
,
only
two
mile
from
Uppercross
.
<EOS>
a
short
absence
from
home
have
leave
his
fair
one
unguarde
by
his
attention
at
this
critical
period
,
and
when
he
come
back
he
have
the
pain
of
find
very
alter
manner
,
and
of
see
Captain
Wentworth
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Musgrove
and
Mrs
Hayter
be
sister
.
<EOS>
They
have
each
have
money
,
but
their
marriage
have
make
a
material
difference
in
their
degree
of
consequence
.
<EOS>
Mr
Hayter
have
some
property
of
his
own
,
but
it
be
insignificant
compare
with
Mr
Musgrove
's
;
and
while
the
musgrove
be
in
the
first
class
of
society
in
the
country
,
the
young
Hayters
would
,
from
their
parent

Henrietta
fully

from

Cousin

which
of

confidence

<EOS>
there
be
not
the

solicitude
or
remark
about
them
in
the
Mansion
-
house
;
but
it
be
different
at
the
Cottage
<EOS>
:
the
young
couple
there
be
more
disposed
to
speculate
and
wonder
;
and
Captain
Wentworth
have
not
be
above
four
or
five
time
in
the
Miss
Musgroves
'
company
,
and
Charles
Hayter
have

just
reappear

Anne
have
to
listen
to
the
opinion
of
her
brother

as

<EOS>
Charles
give
it
for
Louisa

Mary
for
Henrietta

quite
agree
that
to
have
him
marry
either
could
be
extremely
delightful
.
  
<EOS>
Charles
"
have
never
see
a
pleasanter
man
in
his
life
;
and
from
what
he
have
once
hear
Captain
Wentworth
himself
say
,
be
very
sure
that
he
have
not
make
less
than
twenty
thousand
pound
by
the

<EOS>
here
be
a
fortune
at

besides
which
,
there
would

the

what
may

do

he
be
sure
Captain
Wentworth
be
as
likely
a
man
to
distinguish
himself
as
any
officer
in
the
navy
.
<EOS>
oh

it
would
be
a

would
not

<EOS>
Sir
Frederick

<EOS>
It
would
be

a
new
creation

I
never

much
of
your
new

"
  
<EOS>
It
suit
Mary
best
to
think
Henrietta
the
one
prefer
on
the
very
account
of
Charles
Hayter
,
whose
pretension
she
wish
to
see
put
an
end
to
.
<EOS>
She
look
down
very
decidedly
upon
the
Hayters
,
and
think
it
would
be
quite
a
misfortune
to
have
the
exist
connection
between
the
family
renew
 
very
sad
for
herself
and
her
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
can
not
think
him
at
all
a
fit
match
for
Henrietta
;
and
consider
the
alliance
which
the
musgrove
have
make
,
she
have
no
right
to
throw
herself
away
.
<EOS>
I
do
not

any
young

have
a
right
to
make
a
choice
that
may
be
disagreeable
and
inconvenient
to
the
principal
part
of
her
family

be
give
bad
connection
to
those
who
have
not

use
to
them

<EOS>
and
,
pray
,
who
be
Charles
Hayter
?
<EOS>
nothing
but
a
country
curate
.
<EOS>
a
most
improper
match
for
Miss
Musgrove
of
Uppercross
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
husband
,
however
,
would
not
agree
with
her
here
;
for
besides
have
a
regard
for
his
cousin
,
Charles
Hayter
be
an
eld
son
,
and
he
see
thing
as
an
eld
son
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
you
be
talk
nonsense
,
Mary
,
"
be
therefore
his
answer
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
not
be
a
great
match
for
Henrietta
,
but
Charles
have
a
very
fair
chance
,
through
the
Spicers
,
of
get
something
from
the
Bishop
in
the
course
of
a
year
or
two
;
and
you
will
please
to
remember
,
that
he
be
the
eld
son
;
whenever
my
uncle
die
,
he
step
into
very
pretty
property
.
<EOS>
the
estate
at
Winthrop
be
not
less
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
acre
,
besides
the
farm
near
Taunton
,
which
be
some
of
the
good
land
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
I
grant
you
,
that
any
of
them
but
Charles
would
be
a
very
shocking
match
for
Henrietta
,
and
indeed
it
could
not
be
;
he
be
the
only
one
that
could
be
possible
;
but
he
be
a
very
good
-
natured
,
good
sort
of
a
fellow
;
and
whenever
Winthrop
come
into
his
hand
,
he
will
make
a
different
sort
of
place
of
it
,
and
live
in
a
very
different
sort
of
way
;
and
with
that
property
,
he
will
never
be
a
contemptible
man
 
good
,
freehold
property
.
<EOS>
no
,
no
<EOS>
;
Henrietta
may
do
bad
than
marry
Charles
Hayter
;
and
if
she
have
him
,
and
Louisa
can
get
Captain
Wentworth
<EOS>
,
I
shall
be
very
well
satisfied
.

<EOS>
"
Charles
may
say
what
he
please
,
"
cry
Mary
to
Anne
,
as
soon
as
he
be
out
of
the
room
,
"
but
it
would
be
shocking
to
have
Henrietta
marry
Charles
Hayter
;
a
very
bad
thing
for
her
,
and
still
bad
for
me
;
and
therefore
it
be
very
much
to
be
wish
that
Captain
Wentworth
may
soon
put
him
quite
out
of
her
head

and
I
have
very
little
doubt
that
he
have
.

She
take
hardly
any
notice
of
Charles
Hayter
yesterday

<EOS>
I
wish
you
have
be
there
to
see
her
behaviour

and
as
to
Captain
Wentworth

like
Louisa
as
well
as

it
be
nonsense
to
say
so
;

he
certainly
do
like

a
great
deal
the
good

Charles
be
so
positive

<EOS>
I
wish
you
have
be
with
us
yesterday

then
you
may
have
decide
between
us

I

<EOS>
a
dinner
at
Mr
Musgrove
's
have
be
the
occasion
when
all
these
thing
should
have
be
see
by
Anne
;
but
she
have
staid
at
home
,
under
the
mixed
plea
of
a
headache
of
her
own
,
and
some
return
of
indisposition
in
little
Charles
.
<EOS>
She
have
think
only
of
avoid
Captain
Wentworth
;
but
an
escape
from
be
appeal
to
as
umpire
be
now
add
to
the
advantage
of
a
quiet
evening
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
Captain
Wentworth
's
view
,
she
deem
it
of
more
consequence
that
he
should
know
his
own
mind
early
enough
not
to
be
endanger
the
happiness
of
either
sister
,
or
impeach
his
own
honour
,
than
that
he
should
prefer
Henrietta
to
Louisa
,
or
Louisa
to
Henrietta
.
<EOS>
either
of
them
would
,
in
all
probability
,
make
him
an
affectionate
,
good
-
humoured
wife
.
<EOS>
with
regard
to
Charles
Hayter
,
she
have
delicacy
which
must
be
pain
by
any
lightness
of
conduct
in
a
well
-
mean
young
woman
,
and
a
heart
to
sympathize
in
any
of
the
suffering
it
occasion
;
but
if
Henrietta
find
herself
mistake
in
the
nature
of
her
feeling
,
the
alternation
could
not
be
understand
too
soon
.
  
<EOS>
Charles
Hayter
have
meet
with
much
to
disquiet
and
mortify
him
in
his
cousin
's
behaviour
.
<EOS>
She
have
too
old
a
regard
for
him
to
be
so
wholly
estranged
as
may
in
two
meeting
<EOS>
extinguish
every
past
hope
,
and
leave
him
nothing
to
do
but
to
keep
away
from
Uppercross
:
but
there
be
such
a
change
as
become
very
alarming
,
when
such
a
man
as
Captain
Wentworth
be
to
be
regard
as
the
probable
cause
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
absent
only
two
Sundays
,
and
when
they
part
,
have
leave
her
interested
,
even
to
the
height
of
his
wish
,
in
his
prospect
of
soon
quit
his
present
curacy
,
and
obtain
that
of
Uppercross
instead
.
<EOS>
It
have
then
seem
the
object
nearest
her
heart
,
that
Dr
Shirley
,
the
rector
,
who
for
more
than
forty
year
have
be
zealously
discharge
all
the
duty
of
his
office
,
but
be
now
grow
too
infirm
for
many
of
them
,
should
be
quite
fix
on
engage
a
curate
;
should
make
his
curacy
quite
as
good
as
he
could
afford
,
and
should
give
Charles
Hayter
the
promise
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
advantage
of
his
have
to
come
only
to
Uppercross

instead
of
go
six
mile
another
way
;
of
his
have
,
in

he
could
no

get
through
without

injurious
fatigue
,
have
be
a
great
deal
,
even
to
Louisa
,

have
be
almost
everything

Henrietta

<EOS>
when
he
come
back
,
alas
!
<EOS>
the
zeal
of
the
business
be
go
by

<EOS>
Louisa
could
not
listen
at
all
to
his
account
of
a
conversation
which
he
have
just
hold
with
Dr
Shirley
:
she
be
at
a
window
,
look
out
for
Captain
Wentworth
;
and
even
Henrietta
have
at
best
only
a
divided
attention
to
give
,
and
seem
to
have
forget
all
the
former
doubt
and
solicitude

the
negotiation

morning

very

after

Musgroves

at

not

Captain

walk
into

room
at

Cottage

where
be
only
herself
and
the
little
invalid
Charles

who
be
lie
on
the
sofa

<EOS>
the
surprise
of
find
himself
almost
alone
with
Anne
Elliot
,
deprive
his
manner
of
their
usual
composure
:
he
start
,
and
could
only
say
,
"
I
think
the
Miss
Musgroves
have
be
here
:
Mrs
Musgrove
tell
me
I
should
find
them
here
,
"
before
he
walk
to
the
window
to
recollect
himself
,
and
feel
how
he
ought
to
behave
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
up
stair
with
my
sister
:
they
will
be
down
in
a
few
moment
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
"
have
be
Anne
's
reply
,
in
all
the
confusion
that
be
natural
;
and
if
the
child
have
not
call
her
to
come
and
do
something
for
him
,
she
would
have
be
out
of
the
room
the
next
moment
,
and
release
Captain
Wentworth
as
well
as
herself

<EOS>
He
continue
at
the
window
;
and
after
calmly
and
politely
say
,
"
I
hope
the
little
boy
be
well

be
silent
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
oblige
to
kneel
down
by
the
sofa
,
and
remain
there
to
satisfy
her
patient
;

thus
they
continue
a
few
minute
,
when
,
to
her
very
great
satisfaction
,
she
hear
some
other
person
cross
the
little
vestibule
.

She
hope
,
on
turn
her
head
,
to
see
the
master
of
the
house
;
but
it
prove
to
be
one
much
less
calculated
for
make
matter
easy
 
<EOS>
Charles
Hayter
,
probably
not
at
all
better
pleased
by
the
sight
of
Captain
Wentworth
than
Captain
Wentworth
have
be
by
the
sight
of
Anne

She
only

how
do

Will
you

down

will

Captain
Wentworth
,
however
,
come
from
his
window
,
apparently
not
ill
-
dispose
for
conversation
;
but
Charles
Hayter
soon
put
an
end
to
his
attempt
by
seat
himself
near
the
table
,
and
take
up
the
newspaper
;
and
Captain
Wentworth
return
to
his
window

<EOS>
another
minute
bring
another
addition
.
<EOS>
the
young
boy
,
a
remarkable
stout
,
forward
child
,
of
two
year
old
,
have
get
the
door
open
for
him
by
some
one
without
,
make
his
determined
appearance
among
them
,
and
go
straight
to
the
sofa
to
see
what
be
go
on
,
and
put
in
his
claim
to
anything
good
that
may
be
give
away
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
to
eat
,
he
could
only
have
some
play
;
and
as
his
aunt
would
not
let
him
tease
his
sick
brother
,
he
begin
to
fasten
himself
upon
her
,
as
she
knelt
,
in
such
a
way
that
,
busy
as
she
be
about
Charles
,
she
could
not
shake
him
off
.
<EOS>
She
speak
to
him
,
order
,
entreat
,
and
insist
in
vain
.
<EOS>
once
she
do
contrive
to
push
him
away
,
but
the
boy
have
the
great
pleasure
in
get
upon
her
back
again
directly
.

around
her
neck
,
and
he
be
resolutely
bear
away
,
before
she
know
that
Captain
Wentworth
have
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
Her
sensation
on
the
discovery
make
her
perfectly
speechless
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
even
thank
him
.
<EOS>
She
could
only
hang
over
little
Charles
,
with
most
disorder
feeling
.
<EOS>
His
kindness
in
step
forward
to
her
relief
,
the
manner
,
the
silence
in
which
it
have
pass
,
the
little
particular
of
the
circumstance
,
with
the
conviction
soon
force
on
her
by
the
noise
he
be
studiously
make
with
the
child
,
that
he
mean
to
avoid
hear
her
thank
,
and
rather
seek
to
testify
that
her
conversation
be
the
last
of
his
want
,
produce
such
a
confusion
of
varying
,
but
very
painful
agitation
,
as
she
could
not
recover
from
,
till
enable
by
the
entrance
of
Mary
and
the
Miss
Musgroves
to
make
over
her
little
patient
to
their
care
,
and
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
stay
.
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
an
opportunity
of
watch
the
love
and
jealousy
of
the
four
 
<EOS>
they
be
now
altogether
;
but
she
could
stay
for
none
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
that
Charles
Hayter
be
not
well
inclined
towards
Captain
Wentworth
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
strong
impression
of
his
have
say
,
in
a
vext
tone
of
voice
,
after
Captain
Wentworth
's
interference
,
"
You
ought
to
have
mind
me
,
Walter
;
I
tell
you
not
to
teaze
your
aunt
;
"
and
could
comprehend
his
regretting
that
Captain
Wentworth
should
do
what
he
ought
to
have
do
himself
.
<EOS>
but
neither
Charles
Hayter
's
feeling
,
nor
anybody
's
feeling
,
could
interest
her
,
till
she
have
a
little
better
arrange
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
be
ashamed
of
herself
,
quite
ashamed
of
be
so
nervous
,
so
overcome
by
such
a
trifle
;
but
so
it
be
,
and
it
require
a
long
application
of
solitude
and
reflection
to
recover
her
.
    
<EOS>
other
opportunity
of
make
her
observation
could
not
fail
to
occur
.
<EOS>
Anne
have
soon
be
in
company
with
all
the
four
together
often
enough
to
have
an
opinion
,
though
too
wise
to
acknowledge
as
much
at
home
,
where
she
know
it
would
have
satisfy
neither
husband
nor
wife
;
for
while
she
consider
Louisa
to
be
rather
the
favourite
,
she
could
not
but
think
,
as
far
as
she
may
dare
to
judge
from
memory
and
experience
,
that
Captain
Wentworth
be
not
in
love
with
either
.
<EOS>
They
be
more
in
love
with
him
;
yet
there
it
be
not
love
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
little
fever
of
admiration
;
but
it
may
,
probably
must
,
end
in
love
with
some
.
<EOS>
Charles
Hayter
seem
aware
of
be
slight
,
and
yet
Henrietta
have
sometimes
the
air
of
be
divide
between
them
.
<EOS>
Anne
long
for
the
power
of
represent
to
them
all
what
they
be
about
,
and
of
point
out
some
of
the
evil
they
be
expose
themselves
to
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
attribute
guile
to
any
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
high
satisfaction
to
her
to
believe
Captain
Wentworth
not
in
the
least
aware
of
the
pain
he
be
occasion
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
triumph
,
no
pitiful
triumph
in
his
manner
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
probably
,
never
hear
,
and
never
think
of
any
claim
of
Charles
Hayter
.
<EOS>
He
be
only
wrong
in
accept
the
attention
(
for
accept
must
be
the
word
)
of
two
young
woman
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
short
struggle
,
however
,
Charles
Hayter
seem
to
quit
the
field
.
<EOS>
three
day
have
pass
without
his
come
once
to
Uppercross
;
a
most
decide
change
.
<EOS>
He
have
even
refuse
one
regular
invitation
to
dinner
;
and
have
be
find
on
the
occasion
by
Mr
Musgrove
with
some
large
book
before
him
,
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
be
sure
all
could
not
be
right
,
and
talk
,
with
grave
face
,
of
his
study
himself
to
death
.
<EOS>
It
be
Mary
's
hope
and
belief
that
he
have
receive
a
positive
dismissal
from
Henrietta
,
and
her
husband
live
under
the
constant
dependence
of
see
him
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Anne
could
only
feel
that
Charles
Hayter
be
wise
.
  
<EOS>
one
morning
,
about
this
time
Charles
Musgrove
and
Captain
Wentworth
be
go
a
-
shooting
together
,
as
the
sister
in
the
Cottage
be
sit
quietly
at
work
,
they
be
visit
at
the
window
by
the
sister
from
the
Mansion
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
fine
November
day
,
and
the
Miss
Musgroves
come
through
the
little
ground
,
and
stop
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
say
,
that
they
be
go
to
take
a
long
walk
,
and
therefore
conclude
Mary
could
not
like
to
go
with
them
;
and
when
Mary
immediately
reply
,
with
some
jealousy
at
not
be
suppose
a
good
walker
,
"
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
,
I
should
like
to
join
you
very
much
,
I
be
very
fond
of
a
long
walk
;
<EOS>
"
Anne
feel
persuade
,
by
the
look
of
the
two
girl
,
that
it
be
precisely
what
they
do
not
wish
,
and
admire
again
the
sort
of
necessity
which
the
family
habit
seem
to
produce
,
of
everything
be
to
be
communicate
,
and
everything
be
to
be
do
together
,
however
undesired
and
inconvenient
.
<EOS>
She
try
to
dissuade
Mary
from
go
,
but
in
vain
;
and
that
be
the
case
,
think
it
best
to
accept
the
Miss
Musgroves
'
much
more
cordial
invitation
to
herself
to
go
likewise
,
as
she
may
be
useful
in
turn
back
with
her
sister
,
and
lessen
the
interference
in
any
plan
of
their
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
imagine
why
they
should
suppose
I
should
not
like
a
long
walk
,
"
say
Mary
,
as
she
go
up
stair
.
<EOS>
"
everybody
be
always
suppose
that
I
be
not
a
good
walker
;
and
yet
they
would
not
have
be
please
,
if
we
have
refuse
to
join
them
.
<EOS>
when
people
come
in
this
manner
on
purpose
to
ask
us
,
how
can
one
say
no
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
just
as
they
be
set
off
,
the
gentleman
return
.
<EOS>
They
have
take
out
a
young
dog
,
who
have
spoil
their
sport
,
and
send
them
back
early
.
<EOS>
Their
time
and
strength
,
and
spirit
,
be
,
therefore
,
exactly
ready
for
this
walk
,
and
they
enter
into
it
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Could
Anne
have
foresee
such
a
junction
,
she
would
have
staid
at
home
;
but
,
from
some
feeling
of
interest
and
curiosity
,
she
fancy
now
that
it
be
too
late
to
retract
,
and
the
whole
six
set
forward
together
in
the
direction
choose
by
the
Miss
Musgroves
,
who
evidently
consider
the
walk
as
under
their
guidance
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
's
object
be
,
not
to
be
in
the
way
of
anybody
;
and
where
the
narrow
path
across
the
field
make
many
separation
necessary
,
to
keep
with
her
brother
and
sister
.
<EOS>
Her
pleasure
in
the
walk
must
arise
from
the
exercise
and
the
day
,
from
the
view
of
the
last
smile
of
the
year
upon
the
tawny
leave
,
and
wither
hedge
,
and
from
repeat
to
herself
some
few
of
the
thousand
poetical
description
extant
of
autumn
,
that
season
of
peculiar
and
inexhaustible
influence
on
the
mind
of
taste
and
tenderness
,
that
season
which
have
draw
from
every
poet
,
worthy
of
be
read
,
some
attempt
at
description
,
or
some
line
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
She
occupy
her
mind
as
much
as
possible
in
such
like
musing
and
quotation
;
but
it
be
not
possible
,
that
when
within
reach
of
Captain
Wentworth
's
conversation
with
either
of
the
Miss
Musgroves
,
she
should
not
try
to
hear
it
;
yet
she
catch
little
very
remarkable
.
<EOS>
It
be
mere
lively
chat
,
such
as
any
young
person
,
on
an
intimate
footing
,
may
fall
into
.
<EOS>
He
be
more
engaged
with
Louisa
than
with
Henrietta
.
<EOS>
Louisa
certainly
put
more
forward
for
his
notice
than
her
sister
.
<EOS>
this
distinction
appear
to
increase
,
and
there
be
one
speech
of
Louisa
's
which
strike
her
.
<EOS>
after
one
of
the
many
praise
of
the
day
,
which
be
continually
burst
forth
,
Captain
Wentworth
add
:
    
"
what
glorious
weather
for
the
Admiral
and
my
sister
!
<EOS>
They
mean
to
take
a
long
drive
this
morning
;
perhaps
we
may
hail
them
from
some
of
these
hill
.
<EOS>
They
talk
of
come
into
this
side
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whereabout
they
will
upset
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
it
do
happen
very
often
,
I
assure
you
;
but
my
sister
make
nothing
of
it
;
she
would
as
lieve
be
toss
out
as
not
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
You
make
the
most
of
it
,
I
know
,
"
cry
Louisa
,
"
but
if
it
be
really
so
,
I
should
do
just
the
same
in
her
place
.
<EOS>
if
I
love
a
man
,
as
she
love
the
Admiral
,
I
would
always
be
with
him
,
nothing
should
ever
separate
us
,
and
I
would
rather
be
overturn
by
him
,
than
drive
safely
by
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
speak
with
enthusiasm
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
?
"
<EOS>
cry
he
,
catch
the
same
tone
;
"
I
honour
you
!
"
<EOS>
and
there
be
silence
between
them
for
a
little
while
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
could
not
immediately
fall
into
a
quotation
again
.
<EOS>
the
sweet
scene
of
autumn
be
for
a
while
put
by
,
unless
some
tender
sonnet
,
fraught
with
the
apt
analogy
of
the
decline
year
,
with
decline
happiness
,
and
the
image
of
youth
and
hope
,
and
spring
,
all
go
together
,
bless
her
memory
.
<EOS>
She
rouse
herself
to
say
,
as
they
strike
by
order
into
another
path
,
"
be
not
this
one
of
the
way
to
Winthrop
?
"
<EOS>
but
nobody
hear
,
or
,
at
least
,
nobody
answer
her
.
  
<EOS>
Winthrop
,
however
,
or
its
environ
 
for
young
man
be
,
sometimes
to
be
meet
with
,
stroll
about
near
home
 
<EOS>
be
their
destination
;
and
after
another
half
mile
of
gradual
ascent
through
large
enclosure
,
where
the
plough
at
work
,
and
the
fresh
make
path
speak
the
farmer
counteract
the
sweet
of
poetical
despondence
,
and
mean
to
have
spring
again
,
they
gain
the
summit
of
the
most
considerable
hill
,
which
part
Uppercross
and
Winthrop
,
and
soon
command
a
full
view
of
the
latter
,
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
on
the
other
side
.
  
<EOS>
Winthrop
,
without
beauty
and
without
dignity
,
be
stretch
before
them
an
indifferent
house
,
stand
low
,
and
hem
in
by
the
barn
and
building
of
a
farm
-
yard
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
exclaim
,
"
bless
me
!
<EOS>
here
be
Winthrop
.
<EOS>
I
declare
I
have
no
idea
!
<EOS>
well
now
,
I
think
we
have
better
turn
back
;
I
be
excessively
tired
.
"
  
<EOS>
Henrietta
,
conscious
and
ashamed
,
and
see
no
cousin
Charles
walk
along
any
path
,
or
lean
against
any
gate
,
be
ready
to
do
as
Mary
wish
;
but
"
no
!
"
say
Charles
Musgrove
,
and
"
no
,
no
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Louisa
more
eagerly
,
and
take
her
sister
aside
,
seem
to
be
argue
the
matter
warmly
.
  
<EOS>
Charles
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
be
very
decidedly
declare
his
resolution
of
call
on
his
aunt
,
now
that
he
be
so
near
;
and
very
evidently
,
though
more
fearfully
,
try
to
induce
his
wife
to
go
too
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
one
of
the
point
on
which
the
lady
shew
her
strength
;
and
when
he
recommend
the
advantage
of
rest
herself
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
Winthrop
,
as
she
feel
so
tired
,
she
resolutely
answer
,
"
oh
!
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
walk
up
that
hill
again
would
do
her
more
harm
than
any
sit
down
could
do
her
good
;
"
and
,
in
short
,
her
look
and
manner
declare
,
that
go
she
would
not
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
little
succession
of
these
sort
of
debate
and
consultation
,
it
be
settle
between
Charles
and
his
two
sister
,
that
he
and
Henrietta
should
just
run
down
for
a
few
minute
,
to
see
their
aunt
and
cousin
,
while
the
rest
of
the
party
wait
for
them
at
the
top
of
the
hill
.
<EOS>
Louisa
seem
the
principal
arranger
of
the
plan
;
and
,
as
she
go
a
little
way
with
them
,
down
the
hill
,
still
talk
to
Henrietta
,
Mary
take
the
opportunity
of
look
scornfully
around
her
,
and
say
to
Captain
Wentworth
    
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
unpleasant
,
have
such
connexion
!
<EOS>
but
,
I
assure
you
,
I
have
never
be
in
the
house
above
twice
in
my
life
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
receive
no
other
answer
,
than
an
artificial
,
assent
smile
,
follow
by
a
contemptuous
glance
,
as
he
turn
away
,
which
Anne
perfectly
know
the
meaning
of
.
  
<EOS>
the
brow
of
the
hill
,
where
they
remain
,
be
a
cheerful
spot
:
Louisa
return
;
and
Mary
,
find
a
comfortable
seat
for
herself
on
the
step
of
a
stile
,
be
very
well
satisfied
so
long
as
the
other
all
stand
about
her
;
but
when
Louisa
draw
Captain
Wentworth
away
,
to
try
for
a
gleaning
of
nut
in
an
adjoining
hedge
-
row
,
and
they
be
go
by
degree
quite
out
of
sight
and
sound
,
Mary
be
happy
no
longer
;
she
quarrel
with
her
own
seat
,
be
sure
Louisa
have
get
a
much
well
somewhere
,
and
nothing
could
prevent
her
from
go
to
look
for
a
well
also
.
<EOS>
She
turn
through
the
same
gate
,
but
could
not
see
them
.
<EOS>
Anne
find
a
nice
seat
for
her
,
on
a
dry
sunny
bank
,
under
the
hedge
-
row
,
in
which
she
have
no
doubt
of
their
still
be
,
in
some
spot
or
other
.
<EOS>
Mary
sit
down
for
a
moment
,
but
it
would
not
do
;
she
be
sure
Louisa
have
find
a
well
seat
somewhere
else
,
and
she
would
go
on
till
she
overtake
her
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
,
really
tire
herself
,
be
glad
to
sit
down
;
and
she
very
soon
hear
Captain
Wentworth
and
Louisa
in
the
hedge
-
row
,
behind
her
,
as
if
make
their
way
back
along
the
rough
,
wild
sort
of
channel
,
down
the
centre
.
<EOS>
They
be
speak
as
they
draw
near
.
<EOS>
Louisa
's
voice
be
the
first
distinguish
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
be
in
the
middle
of
some
eager
speech
.
<EOS>
what
Anne
first
hear
be
    
"
<EOS>
and
so
,
I
make
her
go
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
that
she
should
be
frighten
from
the
visit
by
such
nonsense
.
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
would
I
be
turn
back
from
do
a
thing
that
I
have
determine
to
do
,
and
that
I
know
to
be
right
,
by
the
air
and
interference
of
such
a
person
,
or
of
any
person
I
may
say
?
<EOS>
no
,
I
have
no
idea
of
be
so
easily
persuade
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
make
up
my
mind
,
I
have
make
it
;
and
Henrietta
seem
entirely
to
have
make
up
her
to
call
at
Winthrop
to
-
day
;
and
yet
,
she
be
as
near
give
it
up
,
out
of
nonsensical
complaisance
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
would
have
turn
back
then
,
but
for
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
would
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
be
almost
ashamed
to
say
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
happy
for
her
,
to
have
such
a
mind
as
yours
at
hand
!
<EOS>
after
the
hint
you
give
just
now
,
which
do
but
confirm
my
own
observation
,
the
last
time
I
be
in
company
with
him
,
I
need
not
affect
to
have
no
comprehension
of
what
be
go
on
.
<EOS>
I
see
that
more
than
a
mere
dutiful
morning
visit
to
your
aunt
be
in
question
;
and
woe
betide
him
,
and
her
too
,
when
it
come
to
thing
of
consequence
,
when
they
be
place
in
circumstance
require
fortitude
and
strength
of
mind
,
if
she
have
not
resolution
enough
to
resist
idle
interference
in
such
a
trifle
as
this
.
<EOS>
Your
sister
be
an
amiable
creature
;
but
yours
be
the
character
of
decision
and
firmness
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
if
you
value
her
conduct
or
happiness
,
infuse
as
much
of
your
own
spirit
into
her
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
but
this
,
no
doubt
,
you
have
be
always
do
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
bad
evil
of
too
yielding
and
indecisive
a
character
,
that
no
influence
over
it
can
be
depend
on
.
<EOS>
You
be
never
sure
of
a
good
impression
be
durable
;
everybody
may
sway
it
.
<EOS>
let
those
who
would
be
happy
be
firm
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
nut
,
"
say
he
,
catch
one
down
from
an
upper
bough
,
"
to
exemplify
:
a
beautiful
glossy
nut
,
which
,
bless
with
original
strength
,
have
outlive
all
the
storm
of
autumn
.
<EOS>
not
a
puncture
,
not
a
weak
spot
anywhere
.
<EOS>
this
nut
,
"
he
continue
,
with
playful
solemnity
,
"
while
so
many
of
his
brother
have
fall
and
be
trodden
under
foot
,
be
still
in
possession
of
all
the
happiness
that
a
hazel
nut
can
be
suppose
capable
of
.
"
<EOS>
then
return
to
his
former
earnest
tone
 
<EOS>
"
My
first
wish
for
all
whom
I
be
interested
in
,
be
that
they
should
be
firm
.
<EOS>
if
Louisa
Musgrove
would
be
beautiful
and
happy
in
her
November
of
life
,
she
will
cherish
all
her
present
power
of
mind
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
do
,
and
be
unanswere
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
surprised
Anne
if
Louisa
could
have
readily
answer
such
a
speech
:
word
of
such
interest
,
speak
with
such
serious
warmth
!
<EOS>
She
could
imagine
what
Louisa
be
feel
.
<EOS>
for
herself
,
she
fear
to
move
,
lest
she
should
be
see
.
<EOS>
while
she
remain
,
a
bush
of
low
rambling
holly
protect
her
,
and
they
be
move
on
.
<EOS>
before
they
be
beyond
her
hearing
,
however
,
Louisa
speak
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
be
good
-
natured
enough
in
many
respect
,
"
say
she
;
"
but
she
do
sometimes
provoke
me
excessively
,
by
her
nonsense
and
pride
 
<EOS>
the
Elliot
pride
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
great
deal
too
much
of
the
Elliot
pride
.
<EOS>
We
do
so
wish
that
Charles
have
marry
Anne
instead
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
know
he
want
to
marry
Anne
?
"
  
<EOS>
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
Captain
Wentworth
say
    
"
do
you
mean
that
she
refuse
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
;
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
when
do
that
happen
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
exactly
know
,
for
Henrietta
and
I
be
at
school
at
the
time
;
but
I
believe
about
a
year
before
he
marry
Mary
.
<EOS>
I
wish
she
have
accept
him
.
<EOS>
We
should
all
have
like
her
a
great
deal
better
;
and
papa
and
mamma
always
think
it
be
her
great
friend
Lady
Russell
's
do
,
that
she
do
not
.
<EOS>
They
think
Charles
may
not
be
learn
and
bookish
enough
to
please
Lady
Russell
,
and
that
therefore
,
she
persuade
Anne
to
refuse
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
sound
be
retreat
,
and
Anne
distinguish
no
more
.
<EOS>
Her
own
emotion
still
keep
her
fix
.
<EOS>
She
have
much
to
recover
from
,
before
she
could
move
.
<EOS>
the
listener
's
proverbial
fate
be
not
absolutely
her
;
she
have
hear
no
evil
of
herself
,
but
she
have
hear
a
great
deal
of
very
painful
import
.
<EOS>
She
see
how
her
own
character
be
consider
by
Captain
Wentworth
,
and
there
have
be
just
that
degree
of
feeling
and
curiosity
about
her
in
his
manner
which
must
give
her
extreme
agitation
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
could
,
she
go
after
Mary
,
and
have
find
,
and
walk
back
with
her
to
their
former
station
,
by
the
stile
,
feel
some
comfort
in
their
whole
party
be
immediately
afterwards
collect
,
and
once
more
in
motion
together
.
<EOS>
Her
spirit
want
the
solitude
and
silence
which
only
number
could
give
.
  
<EOS>
Charles
and
Henrietta
return
,
bringing
,
as
may
be
conjecture
,
Charles
Hayter
with
them
.
<EOS>
the
minutia
of
the
business
Anne
could
not
attempt
to
understand
;
even
Captain
Wentworth
do
not
seem
admit
to
perfect
confidence
here
;
but
that
there
have
be
a
withdrawing
on
the
gentleman
's
side
,
and
a
relenting
on
the
lady
's
,
and
that
they
be
now
very
glad
to
be
together
again
,
do
not
admit
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
Henrietta
look
a
little
ashamed
,
but
very
well
pleased
;
 
Charles
Hayter
exceedingly
happy
:
and
they
be
devoted
to
each
other
almost
from
the
first
instant
of
their
all
setting
forward
for
Uppercross
.
  
<EOS>
everything
now
mark
out
Louisa
for
Captain
Wentworth
;
nothing
could
be
plainer
;
and
where
many
division
be
necessary
,
or
even
where
they
be
not
,
they
walk
side
by
side
nearly
as
much
as
the
other
two
.
<EOS>
in
a
long
strip
of
meadow
land
,
where
there
be
ample
space
for
all
,
they
be
thus
divide
,
form
three
distinct
party
;
and
to
that
party
of
the
three
which
boast
least
animation
,
and
least
complaisance
,
Anne
necessarily
belong
.
<EOS>
She
join
Charles
and
Mary
,
and
be
tired
enough
to
be
very
glad
of
Charles
's
other
arm
;
but
Charles
,
though
in
very
good
humour
with
her
,
be
out
of
temper
with
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Mary
have
shew
herself
disoblige
to
him
,
and
be
now
to
reap
the
consequence
,
which
consequence
be
his
drop
her
arm
almost
every
moment
to
cut
off
the
head
of
some
nettle
in
the
hedge
with
his
switch
;
and
when
Mary
begin
to
complain
of
it
,
and
lament
her
be
ill
-
use
,
accord
to
custom
,
in
be
on
the
hedge
side
,
while
Anne
be
never
incommode
on
the
other
,
he
drop
the
arm
of
both
to
hunt
after
a
weasel
which
he
have
a
momentary
glance
of
,
and
they
could
hardly
get
him
along
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
this
long
meadow
border
a
lane
,
which
their
footpath
,
at
the
end
of
it
be
to
cross
,
and
when
the
party
have
all
reach
the
gate
of
exit
,
the
carriage
advance
in
the
same
direction
,
which
have
be
some
time
hear
,
be
just
come
up
,
and
prove
to
be
Admiral
Croft
's
gig
.
<EOS>
He
and
his
wife
have
take
their
intend
drive
,
and
be
return
home
.
<EOS>
upon
hear
how
long
a
walk
the
young
people
have
engage
in
,
they
kindly
offer
a
seat
to
any
lady
who
may
be
particularly
tired
;
it
would
save
her
a
full
mile
,
and
they
be
go
through
Uppercross
.
<EOS>
the
invitation
be
general
,
and
generally
decline
.
<EOS>
the
Miss
Musgroves
be
not
at
all
tired
,
and
Mary
be
either
offend
,
by
not
be
ask
before
any
of
the
other
,
or
what
Louisa
call
the
Elliot
pride
could
not
endure
to
make
a
third
in
a
one
horse
chaise
.
  
<EOS>
the
walk
party
have
cross
the
lane
,
and
be
surmount
an
opposite
stile
,
and
the
Admiral
be
put
his
horse
in
motion
again
,
when
Captain
Wentworth
clear
the
hedge
in
a
moment
to
say
something
to
his
sister
.
<EOS>
the
something
may
be
guess
by
its
effect
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Elliot
,
I
be
sure
you
be
tired
,
"
cry
Mrs
Croft
.
<EOS>
"
do
let
us
have
the
pleasure
of
take
you
home
.
<EOS>
here
be
excellent
room
for
three
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
if
we
be
all
like
you
,
I
believe
we
may
sit
four
.
<EOS>
You
must
,
indeed
,
you
must
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
be
still
in
the
lane
;
and
though
instinctively
begin
to
decline
,
she
be
not
allow
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
the
Admiral
's
kind
urgency
come
in
support
of
his
wife
be
;
they
would
not
be
refuse
;
they
compress
themselves
into
the
small
possible
space
to
leave
her
a
corner
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
,
without
say
a
word
,
turn
to
her
,
and
quietly
oblige
her
to
be
assist
into
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
yes
;
he
have
do
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
the
carriage
,
and
feel
that
he
have
place
her
there
,
that
his
will
and
his
hand
have
do
it
,
that
she
owe
it
to
his
perception
of
her
fatigue
,
and
his
resolution
to
give
her
rest
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
much
affect
by
the
view
of
his
disposition
towards
her
,
which
all
these
thing
make
apparent
.
<EOS>
this
little
circumstance
seem
the
completion
of
all
that
have
go
before
.
<EOS>
She
understand
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
forgive
her
,
but
he
could
not
be
unfeele
.
<EOS>
though
condemn
her
for
the
past
,
and
consider
it
with
high
and
unjust
resentment
,
though
perfectly
careless
of
her
,
and
though
become
attach
to
another
,
still
he
could
not
see
her
suffer
,
without
the
desire
of
give
her
relief
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
remainder
of
former
sentiment
;
it
be
an
impulse
of
pure
,
though
unacknowledged
friendship
;
it
be
a
proof
of
his
own
warm
and
amiable
heart
,
which
she
could
not
contemplate
without
emotion
so
compound
of
pleasure
and
pain
,
that
she
know
not
which
prevail
.
  
<EOS>
Her
answer
to
the
kindness
and
the
remark
of
her
companion
be
at
first
unconsciously
give
.
<EOS>
They
have
travel
half
their
way
along
the
rough
lane
,
before
she
be
quite
awake
to
what
they
say
.
<EOS>
She
then
find
them
talk
of
"
Frederick
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
certainly
mean
to
have
one
or
other
of
those
two
girl
,
Sophy
,
"
say
the
Admiral
;
"
but
there
be
no
saying
which
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
run
after
them
,
too
,
long
enough
,
one
would
think
,
to
make
up
his
mind
.
<EOS>
ay
,
this
come
of
the
peace
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
war
now
,
he
would
have
settle
it
long
ago
.
<EOS>
We
sailor
,
Miss
Elliot
,
can
not
afford
to
make
long
courtship
in
time
of
war
.
<EOS>
how
many
day
be
it
,
my
dear
,
between
the
first
time
of
my
see
you
and
our
sit
down
together
in
our
lodging
at
North
Yarmouth
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
well
not
talk
about
it
,
my
dear
,
"
reply
Mrs
Croft
,
pleasantly
;
"
for
if
Miss
Elliot
be
to
hear
how
soon
we
come
to
an
understanding
<EOS>
,
she
would
never
be
persuade
that
we
could
be
happy
together
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
you
by
character
,
however
,
long
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
and
I
have
hear
of
you
as
a
very
pretty
girl
,
and
what
be
we
to
wait
for
besides
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
have
such
thing
so
long
in
hand
.
<EOS>
I
wish
Frederick
would
spread
a
little
more
canvass
,
and
bring
us
home
one
of
these
young
lady
to
Kellynch
.
<EOS>
then
there
would
always
be
company
for
them
.
<EOS>
and
very
nice
young
lady
they
both
be
;
I
hardly
know
one
from
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
good
humoured
,
unaffected
girl
,
indeed
,
"
say
Mrs
Croft
,
in
a
tone
of
calm
praise
,
such
as
make
Anne
suspect
that
her
keen
power
may
not
consider
either
of
them
as
quite
worthy
of
her
brother
;
"
and
a
very
respectable
family
.
<EOS>
one
could
not
be
connect
with
well
people
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Admiral
,
that
post
!
<EOS>
we
shall
certainly
take
that
post
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
by
coolly
give
the
rein
a
well
direction
herself
they
happily
pass
the
danger
;
and
by
once
afterwards
judiciously
put
out
her
hand
they
neither
fall
into
a
rut
,
nor
run
foul
of
a
dung
-
cart
;
and
Anne
,
with
some
amusement
at
their
style
of
driving
,
which
she
imagine
no
bad
representation
of
the
general
guidance
of
their
affair
,
find
herself
safely
deposit
by
them
at
the
Cottage
.
    
<EOS>
the
time
now
approach
for
Lady
Russell
's
return
:
the
day
be
even
fix
;
and
Anne
,
be
engage
to
join
her
as
soon
as
she
be
resettle
,
be
look
forward
to
an
early
removal
to
Kellynch
,
and
begin
to
think
how
her
own
comfort
be
likely
to
be
affect
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
place
her
in
the
same
village
with
Captain
Wentworth
,
within
half
a
mile
of
him
;
they
would
have
to
frequent
the
same
church
,
and
there
must
be
intercourse
between
the
two
family
.
<EOS>
this
be
against
her
;
but
on
the
other
hand
,
he
spend
so
much
of
his
time
at
Uppercross
,
that
in
remove
thence
she
may
be
consider
rather
as
leave
him
behind
,
than
as
go
towards
him
;
and
,
upon
the
whole
,
she
believe
she
must
,
on
this
interesting
question
,
be
the
gainer
,
almost
as
certainly
as
in
her
change
of
domestic
society
,
in
leave
poor
Mary
for
Lady
Russell
.
  
<EOS>
She
wish
it
may
be
possible
for
her
to
avoid
ever
see
Captain
Wentworth
at
the
Hall
:
those
room
have
witness
former
meeting
which
would
be
bring
too
painfully
before
her
;
but
she
be
yet
more
anxious
for
the
possibility
of
Lady
Russell
and
Captain
Wentworth
never
meet
anywhere
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
like
each
other
,
and
no
renewal
of
acquaintance
now
could
do
any
good
;
and
be
Lady
Russell
to
see
them
together
,
she
may
think
that
he
have
too
much
self
-
possession
,
and
she
too
little
.
  
<EOS>
these
point
form
her
chief
solicitude
in
anticipate
her
removal
from
Uppercross
,
where
she
feel
she
have
be
station
quite
long
enough
.
<EOS>
Her
usefulness
to
little
Charles
would
always
give
some
sweetness
to
the
memory
of
her
two
month
'
visit
there
,
but
he
be
gain
strength
apace
,
and
she
have
nothing
else
to
stay
for
.
  
<EOS>
the
conclusion
of
her
visit
,
however
,
be
diversify
in
a
way
which
she
have
not
at
all
imagine
.
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
,
after
be
unseen
and
unheard
of
at
Uppercross
for
two
whole
day
,
appear
again
among
them
to
justify
himself
by
a
relation
of
what
have
keep
him
away
.
  
<EOS>
a
letter
from
his
friend
,
Captain
Harville
,
have
find
him
out
at
last
,
have
bring
intelligence
of
Captain
Harville
's
be
settle
with
his
family
at
Lyme
for
the
winter
;
of
their
be
therefore
,
quite
unknowingly
,
within
twenty
mile
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
Captain
Harville
have
never
be
in
good
health
since
a
severe
wound
which
he
receive
two
year
before
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
's
anxiety
to
see
him
have
determine
him
to
go
immediately
to
Lyme
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
there
for
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
.
<EOS>
His
acquittal
be
complete
,
his
friendship
warmly
honour
,
a
lively
interest
excite
for
his
friend
,
and
his
description
of
the
fine
country
about
Lyme
so
feelingly
attend
to
by
the
party
,
that
an
earnest
desire
to
see
Lyme
themselves
,
and
a
project
for
go
thither
be
the
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
people
be
all
wild
to
see
Lyme
.
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
talk
of
go
there
again
himself
,
it
be
only
seventeen
mile
from
Uppercross
;
though
November
,
the
weather
be
by
no
means
bad
;
and
,
in
short
,
Louisa
,
who
be
the
most
eager
of
the
eager
,
have
form
the
resolution
to
go
,
and
besides
the
pleasure
of
do
as
she
like
,
be
now
armed
with
the
idea
of
merit
in
maintain
her
own
way
,
bear
down
all
the
wish
of
her
father
and
mother
for
put
it
off
till
summer
;
and
to
Lyme
they
be
to
go
 
Charles
,
Mary
,
Anne
,
Henrietta
,
Louisa
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
heedless
scheme
have
be
to
go
in
the
morning
and
return
at
night
;
but
to
this
Mr
Musgrove
,
for
the
sake
of
his
horse
,
would
not
consent
;
and
when
it
come
to
be
rationally
consider
,
a
day
in
the
middle
of
November
would
not
leave
much
time
for
see
a
new
place
,
after
deduct
seven
hour
,
as
the
nature
of
the
country
require
,
for
go
and
return
.
<EOS>
They
be
,
consequently
,
to
stay
the
night
there
,
and
not
to
be
expect
back
till
the
next
day
's
dinner
.
<EOS>
this
be
feel
to
be
a
considerable
amendment
;
and
though
they
all
meet
at
the
Great
House
at
rather
an
early
breakfast
hour
,
and
set
off
very
punctually
,
<EOS>
it
be
so
much
past
noon
before
the

Mr
Musgrove

Charles

which
he

Captain
Wentworth
,
be
descend
the
long
hill
into
Lyme
,
and
enter
upon
the
still
steep
street
of
the
town
itself
,
that
it
be
very
evident
they
would
not
have
more
than
time
for
look
about
them
,
before
the
light
and
warmth
of
the
day
be
go

<EOS>
after
secure
accommodation
,
and
order
a
dinner
at
one
of
the
inn

the
next
thing
to
be
do
be
unquestionably
to
walk
directly
down
to
the
sea

<EOS>
They

it

who

near
the

an
old

<EOS>
Captain

turn
in
to
call
on
his
friend
;
the
other
walk
on
,
and
he
be
to
join
them
on
the
Cobb
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
by
no
mean
tired
of
wonder
and
admire
;
and
not
even
Louisa
seem
to
feel
that
they
have
part
with
Captain
Wentworth
long
,
when
they
see
him
come
after
them
,
with
three
companion
,
all
well
know
already

by
description
,
to
be
Captain
and
Mrs
Harville
,
and
a
Captain
Benwick

who
be
stay
with
them

<EOS>
Captain
Benwick
have
some
time
ago
be
first
lieutenant
of
the
Laconia
;
and
the
account
which
Captain
Wentworth
have
give
of
him
,
on
his
return
from
Lyme
before
,
his
warm
praise
of
him
as
an
excellent
young
man
and
an
officer
,
whom
he
have
always
value
highly
,
which
must
have
stamp
him
well
in
the
esteem
of
every
listener
,
have
be
follow
by
a
little
history
of
his
private
life
,
which
render
him
perfectly
interesting
in
the
eye
of
all
the
lady
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
engage
to
Captain
Harville
's
sister
,
and
be
now
mourn
her
loss
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
a
year
or
two
wait
for
fortune
and
promotion
.
<EOS>
Fortune
come
,
his
prize
-
money
as
lieutenant
be
great
;
promotion
,
too
,
come
at
last
;
but
Fanny
Harville
do
not
live
to
know
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
die
the
precede
summer
while
he
be
at
sea
.
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
believe
it
impossible
for
man
to
be
more
attach
to
woman
than
poor
Benwick
have
be
to
Fanny
Harville
,
or
to
be
more
deeply
afflict
under
the
dreadful
change
.
<EOS>
He
consider
his
disposition
as
of
the
sort
which
must
suffer
heavily
,
unite
very
strong
feeling
with
quiet
,
serious
,
and
retire
manner
,
and
a
decide
taste
for
reading
,
and
sedentary
pursuit
.
<EOS>
to
finish
the
interest
of
the
story
,
the
friendship
between
him
and
the
Harvilles
seem
,
if
possible
,
augment
by
the
event
which
close
all
their
view
of
alliance
,
and
Captain
Benwick
be
now
live
with
them
entirely
.
<EOS>
Captain
Harville
have
take
his
present
house
for
half
a
year
;
his
taste
,
and
his
health
,
and
his
fortune
,
all
direct
him
to
a
residence
inexpensive
,
and
by
the
sea
;
and
the
grandeur
of
the
country
,
and
the
retirement
of
Lyme
in
the
winter
,
appear
exactly
adapt
to
Captain
Benwick
's
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
the
sympathy
and
good

will
excite
towards
Captain
Benwick
be
very
great

"

he

perhaps
,
a

I

<EOS>
I
can
not
believe
his
prospect
so
blight
for
ever

<EOS>
He
be
young
than
I
be
;
young
in
feeling
,
if
not
in
fact
;
young
as
a
man

<EOS>
He
will
rally
again
,
and
be
happy
with
another

"
  
<EOS>
They
all
meet
,
and
be
introduce
.
<EOS>
Captain
Harville
be
a
tall
,
dark
man
,
with
a
sensible
,
benevolent
countenance
;
a
little
lame
;
and
from
strong
feature
and
want
of
health
,
look
much
old
than
Captain
Wentworth
.
<EOS>
Captain
Benwick
look
,
and
be
,
the
young
of
the
three
,
and
,
compare
with
either
of
them
,
a
little
man
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
pleasing
face
and
a
melancholy
air
,
just
as
he
ought
to
have
,
and
draw
back
from
conversation

<EOS>
Captain
Harville
,
though
not
equal
Captain
Wentworth
in
manner
,
be
a
perfect
gentleman
,
unaffected
,
warm
,
and
oblige
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Harville
,
a
degree
less
polished
than
her
husband
,
seem
,
however
,
to
have
the
same
good
feeling
;
and
nothing
could
be
more
pleasant
than
their
desire
of
consider
the
whole
party
as
friend
of
their
own
,
because
the
friend
of
Captain
Wentworth
,
or
more
kindly
hospitable
than
their
entreaty
for
their
all
promising
to
dine
with
them

<EOS>
the
dinner
,
already
order
at
the
inn
,
be
at
last
,
though
unwillingly
,
accept
as
a
excuse
;
but
they
seem
almost
hurt
that
Captain
Wentworth
should
have
bring
any
such
party
to
Lyme
,
without
consider
it
as
a
thing
of
course
that
they
should
dine
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
so
much
attachment
to
Captain
Wentworth
in
all
this
,
and
such
a
bewitch
charm
in
a
degree
of
hospitality
so
uncommon
,
so
unlike
the
usual
style
of
give
-
and
-
take
invitation
,
and
dinner
of
formality
and
display
,
that
Anne
feel
her
spirit
not
likely
to
be
benefit
by
an
increase
acquaintance
among
his
brother
-
officer
.
<EOS>
"
these
would
have
be
all
my
friend
,
"
be
her
think
;
and
she
have
to
struggle
against
a
great
tendency
to
lowness
.
  
<EOS>
on
quit
the
Cobb
,
they
all
go
in
-
door
with
their
new
friend
,
and
find
room
so
small
as
none
but
those
who
invite
from
the
heart
could
think
capable
of
accommodate
so
many
.
<EOS>
Anne
have
a
moment
's
astonishment
on
the
subject
herself
;
but
it
be
soon
lose
in
the
pleasanter
feeling
which
spring
from
the
sight
of
all
the
ingenious
contrivance
and
nice
arrangement
of
Captain
Harville
,
to
turn
the
actual
space
to
the
good
account
,
to
supply
the
deficiency
of
lodging
-
house
furniture
,
and
defend
the
window
and

against
the
winter
storm
to

the

where
the
common

in
the
common
indifferent
plight

with
some
few
article
of
a
rare
specie
of
wood
,
excellently
work
up
,
and
with
something
curious
and
valuable
from
all
the
distant
country
Captain
Harville
have
visit
,
be
more
than
amusing
to
Anne
;
connect
as
it
all
be
with
his
profession
,
the
fruit
of
its
labour
,
the
effect
of
its
influence
on
his
habit
,
the
picture
of
repose
and
domestic
happiness
it
present

make
it
to
her
a
something
more
,
or
less
,
than
gratification
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Harville
be
no
reader
;
but
he
have
contrive
excellent
accommodation
,
and
fashion
very
pretty
shelf
,
for
a
tolerable
collection
of
well

bind
volume
,
the
property
of
Captain
Benwick
.
<EOS>
His
lameness
prevent
him
from
take
much
exercise
;
but
a
mind
of
usefulness
and
ingenuity
seem
to
furnish
him
with
constant
employment
within
.
<EOS>
He
draw

he

he

new

and
if
everything
else

sit
down
to
his
large
fishing

net
at
one
corner
of
the
room

<EOS>
Anne
think
she
leave
great
happiness
behind
her
when
they
quit
the
house
;
and
Louisa
,
by
whom
she
find
herself
walk
,
burst
forth
into
rapture
of
admiration
and
delight
on
the
character
of
the
navy
;
their
friendliness
,
their
brotherliness
,
their
openness
,
their
uprightness

protest
that

convince

more
worth

warmth
than
any
other

man
in
England
;
that
they
only
know
how
to
live
,
and
they
only
deserve
to
be
respect
and
love

<EOS>
They
go
back
to
dress
and
dine
;
and
so
well
have
the
scheme
answer
already
,
that
nothing
be
find
amiss
;
though
its
being
"
so
entirely
out
of

"
and
the
"
no

of
Lyme
,
"
and
the
"
no

have
bring
many
apology
from

<EOS>
Anne
find
herself
by
this
time
grow
so
much
more
hardened
to
be
in
Captain
Wentworth

company
than
she
have
at
first
imagine
could
ever
be

that
the
sit
down

the

table
with
him
now
,
and
the
interchange

the
common
civility
attend
on
it
(
they
never

be
become
a
mere
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
the
night
be
too
dark
for
the
lady
to
meet
again
till
the
morrow
,
but
Captain
Harville
have
promise
them
a
visit
in
the
evening
;
and
he
come
,
bring
his
friend
also
,
which
be
more
than
have
be
expect
,
it
have
be
agree
that
Captain
Benwick
have
all
the
appearance
of
be
oppress
by
the
presence
of
so
many
stranger
.
<EOS>
He
venture
among
them
again
,
however
,
though
his
spirit
certainly
do
not
seem
fit
for
the
mirth
of
the
party
in
general
.
  
<EOS>
while
Captains
Wentworth
and
Harville
lead
the
talk
on
one
side
of
the
room
,
and
by
recur
to
former
day
,
supply
anecdote
in
abundance
to
occupy
and
entertain
the
other
,
it
fall
to
Anne
's
lot
to
be
place
rather
apart
with
Captain
Benwick
;
and
a
very
good
impulse
of
her
nature
oblige
her
to
begin
an
acquaintance
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
shy
,
and
dispose
to
abstraction
;
but
the
engage
mildness
of
her
countenance
,
and
gentleness
of
her
manner
,
soon
have
their
effect
;
and
Anne
be
well
repay
the
first
trouble
of
exertion
.
<EOS>
He
be
evidently
a
young
man
of
considerable
taste
in
reading
,
though
principally
in
poetry
;
and
besides
the
persuasion
of
have
give
him
at
least
an
evening
's
indulgence
in
the
discussion
of
subject
,
which
his
usual
companion
have
probably
no
concern
in
<EOS>
,
she
have
the
hope
of
be
of
real
use
to
him
in
some
suggestion
as
to
the
duty
and
benefit
of
struggle
against
affliction
,
which
have
naturally
grow
out
of
their
conversation
.
<EOS>
for
,
though
shy
,
he
do
not
seem
reserve
;
it
have
rather
the
appearance
of
feeling
glad
to
burst
their
usual
restraint
;
and
have
talk
of
poetry
,
the
richness
of
the
present
age
,
and
go
through
a
brief
comparison
of
opinion
as
to
the
first
-
rate
poet
,
try
to
ascertain
whether
Marmion
or
the
Lady
of
the
Lake
be
to
be
prefer
,
and
how
rank
the
Giaour
and
the
Bride
of
Abydos
;
and
moreover
,
how
the
Giaour
be
to
be
pronounce
,
he
show
himself
so
intimately
acquaint
with
all
the
tender
song
of
the
one
poet
,
and
all
the
impassione
description
of
hopeless
agony
of
the
other
;
he
repeat
,
with
such
tremulous
feeling
,
the
various
line
which
image
a
broken
heart
,
or
a
mind
destroy
by
wretchedness
,
and
look
so
entirely
as
if
he
mean
to
be
understand
,
that
she
venture
to
hope
he
do
not
always
read
only
poetry
,
and
to
say
,
that
she
think
it
be
the
misfortune
of
poetry
to
be
seldom
safely
enjoy
by
those
who
enjoy
it
completely
;
and
that
the
strong
feeling
which
alone
could
estimate
it
truly
be
the
very
feeling
which
ought
to
taste
it
but
sparingly
.
  
<EOS>
His
look
shew
him
not
pain
,
but
please
with
this
allusion
to
his
situation
,
she
be
embolden
to
go
on
;
and
feeling
in
herself
the
right
of
seniority
of
mind
<EOS>
,
she
venture
to
recommend
a
large
allowance
of
prose
in
his
daily
study
;
and
on
be
request
to
particularize
,
mention
such
work
of
our
good
moralist
,
such
collection
of
the
fine
letter
,
such
memoir
of
character
of
worth
and
suffering
,
as
occur
to
her
at
the
moment
as
calculate
to
rouse
and
fortify
the
mind
by
the
high
precept
,
and
the
strong
example
of
moral
and
religious
endurance
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Benwick
listen
attentively
,
and
seem
grateful
for
the
interest
imply
;
and
though
with
a
shake
of
the
head
,
and
sigh
which
declare
his
little
faith
in
the
efficacy
of
any
book
on
grief
like
his
,
note
down
the
name
of
those
she
recommend
,
and
promise
to
procure
and
read
them
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
evening
be
over
,
Anne
could
not
but
be
amuse
at
the
idea
of
her
come
to
Lyme
to
preach
patience
and
resignation
to
a
young
man
whom
she
have
never
see
before
;
nor
could
she
help
fear
,
on
more
serious
reflection
,
that
,
like
many
other
great
moralist
and
preacher
,
she
have
be
eloquent
on
a
point
in
which
her
own
conduct
would
ill
bear
examination
.
    
<EOS>
Anne
and
Henrietta
,
find
themselves
the
early
of
the
party
the
next
morning
,
agree
to
stroll
down
to
the
sea
before
breakfast
.
<EOS>
They
go
to
the
sand
,
to
watch
the
flowing
of
the
tide
,
which
a
fine
south
-
easterly
breeze
be
bring
in
with
all
the
grandeur
which
so
flat
a
shore
admit
.
<EOS>
They
praise
the
morning
;
gloried
in
the
sea
;
sympathize
in
the
delight
of
the
fresh
-
feeling
breeze
 
and
be
silent
;
till
Henrietta
suddenly
begin
again
with
    
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
 
I
be
quite
convinced
that
,
with
very
few
exception
,
the
sea
-
air
always
do
good
.
<EOS>
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
its
have
be
of
the
great
service
to
Dr
Shirley
,
after
his
illness
,
last
spring
twelve
-
month
.
<EOS>
He
declare
himself
,
that
come
to
Lyme
for
a
month
,
do
him
more
good
than
all
the
medicine
he
take
;
and
,
that
be
by
the
sea
,
always
make
him
feel
young
again
.
<EOS>
now
,
I
can
not
help
think
it
a
pity
that
he
do
not
live
entirely
by
the
sea
.
<EOS>
I
do
think
he
have
better
leave
Uppercross
entirely
,
and
fix
at
Lyme
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
,
Anne
?
<EOS>
do
not
you
agree
with
me
,
that
it
be
the
good
thing
he
could
do
,
both
for
himself
and
Mrs
Shirley
?
<EOS>
She
have
cousin
here
,
you
know
,
and
many
acquaintance
,
which
would
make
it
cheerful
for
her
,
and
I
be
sure
she
would
be
glad
to
get
to
a
place
where
she
could
have
medical
attendance
at
hand
,
in
case
of
his
have
another
seizure
.
<EOS>
indeed
I
think
it
quite
melancholy
to
have
such
excellent
people
as
Dr
and
Mrs
Shirley
,
who
have
be
do
good
all
their
life
,
wear
out
their
last
day
in
a
place
like
Uppercross
,
where
,
except
our
family
,
they
seem
shut
out
from
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
wish
his
friend
would
propose
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
really
think
they
ought
.
<EOS>
and
,
as
to
procure
a
dispensation
,
there
could
be
no
difficulty
at
his
time
of
life
,
and
with
his
character
.
<EOS>
My
only
doubt
be
,
whether
anything
could
persuade
him
to
leave
his
parish
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
very
strict
and
scrupulous
in
his
notion
;
over
-
scrupulous
I
must
say
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
,
Anne
,
it
be
be
over
-
scrupulous
?
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
it
be
quite
a
mistaken
point
of
conscience
,
when
a
clergyman
sacrifice
his
health
for
the
sake
of
duty
,
which
may
be
just
as
well
perform
by
another
person
?
<EOS>
and
at
Lyme
too
,
only
seventeen
mile
off
,
he
would
be
near
enough
to
hear
,
if
people
think
there
be
anything
to
complain
of
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
smile
more
than
once
to
herself
during
this
speech
,
and
enter
into
the
subject
,
as
ready
to
do
good
by
enter
into
the
feeling
of
a
young
lady
as
of
a
young
man
,
though
here
it
be
good
of
a
low
standard
,
for
what
could
be
offer
but
general
acquiescence
?
<EOS>
She
say
all
that
be
reasonable
and
proper
on
the
business
;
feel
the
claim
of
Dr
Shirley
to
repose
as
she
ought
;
see
how
very
desirable
it
be
that
he
should
have
some
active
,
respectable
young
man
,
as
a
resident
curate
,
and
be
even
courteous
enough
to
hint
at
the
advantage
of
such
resident
curate
's
be
marry
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
"
say
Henrietta
,
very
well
pleased
with
her
companion
,
"
I
wish
Lady
Russell
live
at
Uppercross
,
and
be
intimate
with
Dr
Shirley
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
hear
of
Lady
Russell
as
a
woman
of
the
great
influence
with
everybody
!
<EOS>
I
always
look
upon
her
as
able
to
persuade
a
person
to
anything
!
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
of
her
,
as
I
have
tell
you
before
,
quite
afraid
of
her
,
because
she
be
so
very
clever
;
but
I
respect
her
amazingly
,
and
wish
we
have
such
a
neighbour
at
Uppercross
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
be
amuse
by
Henrietta
's
manner
of
be
grateful
,
and
amuse
also
that
the
course
of
event
and
the
new
interest
of
Henrietta
's
view
should
have
place
her
friend
at
all
in
favour
with
any
of
the
Musgrove
family
;
she
have
only
time
,
however
,
for
a
general
answer
,
and
a
wish
that
such
another
woman
be
at
Uppercross
,
before
all
subject
suddenly
cease
,
on
see
Louisa
and
Captain
Wentworth
come
towards
them
.
<EOS>
They
come
also
for
a
stroll
till
breakfast
be
likely
to
be
ready
;
but
Louisa
recollecting
,
immediately
afterwards
that
she
have
something
to
procure
at
a
shop
,
invite
them
all
to
go
back
with
her
into
the
town
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
at
her
disposal
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
come
to
the
step
,
lead
upwards
from
the
beach
,
a
gentleman
,
at
the
same
moment
prepare
to
come
down
,
politely
draw
back
,
and
stop
to
give
them
way
.
<EOS>
They
ascend
and
pass
him
;
and
as
they
pass
,
Anne
's
face
catch
his
eye
,
and
he
look
at
her
with
a
degree
of
earnest
admiration
,
which
she
could
not
be
insensible
of
.
<EOS>
She
be
look
remarkably
well
;
<EOS>
her
very
regular
,
very
pretty
feature
,
have
the
bloom
and
freshness
of
youth
restore
by
the
fine
wind
which
have
be
blow
on
her
complexion
,
and
by
the
animation
of
eye
which
it
have
also
produce
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
that
the
gentleman
,
(
completely
a
gentleman
in
manner
)
admire
her
exceedingly
.
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
look
round
at
her
instantly
in
a
way
which
shew
his
noticing
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
give
her
a
momentary
glance
,
a
glance
of
brightness
,
which
seem
to
say
,
"
that
man
be
strike
with
you
,
and
even
I
,
at
this
moment
,
see
something
like
Anne
Elliot
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
attend
Louisa
through
her
business
,
and
loiter
about
a
little
longer
,
they
return
to
the
inn
;
and
Anne
,
in
pass
afterwards
quickly
from
her
own
chamber
to
their
dining
-
room
,
have
nearly
run
against
the
very
same
gentleman
,
as
he
come
out
of
an
adjoining
apartment
.
<EOS>
She
have
before
conjecture
him
to
be
a
stranger
like
themselves
,
and
determine
that
a
well
-
look
groom
,
who
be
stroll
about
near
the
two
inn
as
they
come
back
,
should
be
his
servant
.
<EOS>
both
master
and
man
be
in
mourn
assist
the
idea
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
prove
that
he
belong
to
the
same
inn
as
themselves
;
and
this
second
meeting
,
short
as
it
be
,
also
prove
again
by
the
gentleman
's
look
,
that
he
think
hers
very
lovely
,
and
by
the
readiness
and
propriety
of
his
apology
,
that
he
be
a
man
of
exceedingly
good
manner
.
<EOS>
He
seem
about
thirty
,
and
though
not
handsome
,
have
an
agreeable
person
.
<EOS>
Anne
feel
that
she
should
like
to
know
who
he
be
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
nearly
do
breakfast
,
when
the
sound
of
a
carriage
,
(
almost
the
first
they
have
hear
since
enter
Lyme
)
draw
half
the
party
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
gentleman
's
carriage
,
a
curricle
,
but
only
come
round
from
the
stable
-
yard
to
the
front
door
;
somebody
must
be
go
away
.
<EOS>
It
be
drive
by
a
servant
in
mourning
.
  
<EOS>
the
word
curricle
make
Charles
Musgrove
jump
up
that
he
may
compare
it
with
his
own
;
the
servant
in
mourning
rouse
Anne
's
curiosity
,
and
the
whole
six
be
collect
to
look
,
by
the
time
the
owner
of
the
curricle
be
to
be
see
issue
from
the
door
amidst
the
bow
and
civility
of
the

,
and
take
his
seat
,
to

off
.
  
<EOS>
"

cry
Captain
Wentworth
,
instantly
,
and
with
half
a
glance
at
Anne
,
<EOS>
"

"
  
<EOS>
the

should
not
have
be
introduce
to
each
other
!
<EOS>
do
you
think
he
have
the
Elliot
countenance
?
<EOS>
I
hardly
look
at
him
,
I
be
look
at
the
horse
;
but
I
think
he
have
something
of
the
Elliot
countenance
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
the
arm
do
not
strike
me
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
the
great
-
coat
be
hang
over
the
panel
,
and
hide
the
arm
,
so
it
do
;
otherwise
,
I
be
sure
,
I
should
have
observe
them
,
and
the
livery
too
;
if
the
servant
have
not
be
in
mourning
,
one
should
have
know
him
by
the
livery
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
put
all
these
very
extraordinary
circumstance
together
,
"
say
Captain
Wentworth
,
"
we
must
consider
it
to
be
the
arrangement
of
Providence
,
that
you
should
not
be
introduce
to
your
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
she
could
command
Mary
's
attention
,
Anne
quietly
try
to
convince
her
that
their
father
and
Mr
Elliot
have
not
,
for
many
year
,
be
on
such
term
as
to
make
the
power
of
attempt
an
introduction
at
all
desirable
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
however
,
it
be
a
secret
gratification
to
herself
to
have
see
her
cousin
,
and
to
know
that
the
future
owner
of
Kellynch
be
undoubtedly
a
gentleman
,
and
have
an
air
of
good
sense
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
,
upon
any
account
,
mention
her
have
meet
with
him
the
second
time
;
luckily
Mary
do
not
much
attend
to
their
have
pass
close
by
him
in
their
early
walk
,
but
she
would
have
feel
quite
ill
-
use
by
Anne
's
have
actually
run
against
him
in
the
passage
,
and
receive
his
very
polite
excuse
,
while
she
have
never
be
near
him
at
all
;
no
,
that
cousinly
little
interview
must
remain
a
perfect
secret
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
"
say
Mary
,
"
you
will
mention
our
see
Mr
Elliot
,
the
next
time
you
write
to
Bath
.
<EOS>
I
think
my
father
certainly
ought
to
hear
of
it
;
do
mention
all
about
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
avoid
a
direct
reply
,
but
it
be
just
the
circumstance
which
she
consider
as
not
merely
unnecessary
to
be
communicate
,
but
as
what
ought
to
be
suppress
.
<EOS>
the
offence
which
have
be
give
her
father
,
many
year
back
,
she
know
;
Elizabeth
's
particular
share
in
it
she
suspect
;
and
that
Mr
Elliot
's
idea
always
produce
irritation
in
both
be
beyond
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
Mary
never
write
to
Bath
herself
;
all
the
toil
of
keep
up
a
slow
and
unsatisfactory
correspondence
with
Elizabeth
fall
on
Anne
.
  
<EOS>
Breakfast
have
not
be
long
over
,
when
they
be
join
by
Captain
and
Mrs
Harville
and
Captain
Benwick
;
with
whom
they
have
appoint
to
take
their
last
walk
about
Lyme
.
<EOS>
They
ought
to
be
set
off
for
Uppercross
by
one
,
and
in
the
mean
while
be
to
be
all
together
,
and
out
of
door
as
long
as
they
could
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
find
Captain
Benwick
get
near
her
,
as
soon
as
they
be
all
fairly
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
Their
conversation
the
precede
evening
do
not
disincline
him
to
seek
her
again
;
and
they
walk
together
some
time
,
talk
as
before
of
Mr
Scott
and
Lord
Byron
,
and
still
as
unable
as
before
,
and
as
unable
as
any
other
two
reader
,
to
think
exactly
alike
of
the
merit
of
either
,
till
something
occasion
an
almost
general
change
amongst
their
party
,
and
instead
of
Captain
Benwick
<EOS>
,
she
have
Captain
Harville
by
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Elliot
,
"
say
he
,
speak
rather
low
,
"
you
have
do
a
good
deed
in
make
that
poor
fellow
talk
so
much
.
<EOS>
I
wish
he
could
have
such
company
oftener
.
<EOS>
It
be
bad
for
him
,
I
know
,
to
be
shut
up
as
he
be
;
but
what
can
we
do
?
<EOS>
We
can
not
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Anne
,
"
that
I
can
easily
believe
to
be
impossible
;
but
in
time
,
perhaps
 
we
know
what
time
do
in
every
case
of
affliction
,
and
you
must
remember
,
Captain
Harville
,
that
your
friend
may
yet
be
call
a
young
mourner
 
only
last
summer
,
I
understand
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
ay
,
true
enough
,
"
(
with
a
deep
sigh
)
"
only
June
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
not
known
to
him
,
perhaps
,
so
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
till
the
first
week
of
August
,
when
he
come
home
from
the
Cape
,
just
make
into
the
Grappler
.
<EOS>
I
be
at
Plymouth
dread
to
hear
of
him
;
he
send
in
letter
,
but
the
Grappler
be
under
order
for
Portsmouth
.
<EOS>
there
the
news
must
follow
him
,
but
who
be
to
tell
it
?
<EOS>
not
I.
I
would
as
soon
have
be
run
up
to
the
yard
-
arm
.
<EOS>
nobody
could
do
it
,
but
that
good
fellow
"
(
point
to
Captain
Wentworth
.
)
<EOS>
"
the
Laconia
have
come
into
Plymouth
the
week
before
;
no
danger
of
her
be
send
to
sea
again
.
<EOS>
He
stand
his
chance
for
the
rest
;
write
up
for
leave
of
absence
,
but
without
wait
the
return
,
travel
night
and
day
till
he
get
to
Portsmouth
,
row
off
to
the
Grappler
that
instant
,
and
never
leave
the
poor
fellow
for
a
week
.
<EOS>
that
be
what
he
do
,
and
nobody
else
could
have
save
poor
James
.
<EOS>
You
may
think
,
Miss
Elliot
,
whether
he
be
dear
to
us
!
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
do
think
on
the
question
with
perfect
decision
,
and
say
as
much
in
reply
as
her
own
feeling
could
accomplish
,
or
as
his
seem
able
to
bear
,
for
he
be
too
much
affect
to
renew
the
subject
,
and
when
he
speak
again
,
it
be
of
something
totally
different
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Harville
's
give
it
as
her
opinion
that
her
husband
would
have
quite
walk
enough
by
the
time
he
reach
home
,
determine
the
direction
of
all
the
party
in
what
be
to
be
their
last
walk
;
they
would
accompany
them
to
their
door
,
and
then
return
and
set
off
themselves
.
<EOS>
by
all
their
calculation
there
be
just
time
for
this
;
but
as
they
draw
near
the
Cobb
,
there
be
such
a
general
wish
to
walk
along
it
once
more
,
<EOS>
all
be
so
inclined
,
and
Louisa
soon
grow
so
determined
,
that
the
difference
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
it
be
find
,
would
be
no
difference
at
all
;
so
with
all
the
kind
leave
-
taking
,
and
all
the
kind
interchange
of
invitation
and
promise
which
may
be
imagine
,
they
part
from
Captain
and
Mrs
Harville
at
their
own
door
,
and
still
accompany
by
Captain
Benwick
,
who
seem
to
cling
to
them
to
the
last
,
proceed
to
make
the
proper
adieu
to
the
Cobb
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
find
Captain
Benwick
again
draw
near
her
.
<EOS>
Lord
Byron
's
"
dark
blue
sea
"
could
not
fail
of
be
bring
forward
by
their
present
view
,
and
she
gladly
give
him
all
her
attention
as
long
as
attention
be
possible
.
<EOS>
It
be
soon
draw
,
perforce
another
way
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
too
much
wind
to
make
the
high
part
of
the
new
Cobb
pleasant
for
the
lady
,
and
they
agree
to
get
down
the
step
to
the
low
,
and
all
be
content
to
pass
quietly
and
carefully
down
the
steep
flight
,
except
Louisa
;
she
must
be
jump
down
them
by
Captain
Wentworth
.
<EOS>
in
all
their
walk
,
he
have
have
to
jump
her
from
the
stile
;
the
sensation
be
delightful
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
hardness
of
the
pavement
for
her
foot
,
make
him
less
willing
upon
the
present
occasion
;
he
do
it
,
however
.
<EOS>
She
be
safely
down
,
and
instantly
,
to
show
her
enjoyment
,
run
up
the
step
to
be
jump
down
again
.
<EOS>
He
advise
her
against
it
,
think
the
jar
too
great
;
but
no
,
he
reason
and
talk
in
vain
,
she
smile
and
say
,
"
I
be
determined
I
will
:
"
he
put
out
his
hand
;
she
be
too
precipitate
by
half
a
second
,
she
fall
on
the
pavement
on
the
Lower
Cobb
,
and
be
take
up
lifeless
!
<EOS>
there
be
no
wound
,
no
blood
,
no
visible
bruise
;
but
her
eye
be
closed
,
she
breathe
not
,
her
face
be
like
death
.
<EOS>
the
horror
of
the
moment
to
all
who
stand
around
!
  
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
,
who
have
catch
her
up
,
knelt
with
her
in
his
arm
,
look
on
her
with
a
face
as
pallid
as
her
own
,
in
an
agony
of
silence
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
dead
!
<EOS>
she
be
dead
!
"
<EOS>
scream
Mary
,
catch
hold
of
her
husband
,
and
contribute
with
his
own
horror
to
make
him
immoveable
;
and
in
another
moment
,
Henrietta
,
sink
under
the
conviction
,
lose
her
sense
too
,
and
would
have
fall
on
the
step
,
but
for
Captain
Benwick
and
Anne
,
who
catch
and
support
her
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
no
one
to
help
me
?
"
be
the
first
word
which
burst
from
Captain
Wentworth
,
in
a
tone
of
despair
,
and
as
if
all
his
own
strength
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
go
to
him

Anne

for
heaven
's
sake

to
him

I
can
support
her
myself
.
<EOS>
leave
me
,
and
go
to
him
.
<EOS>
rub
her
hand
,
rub
her
temple
;
here
be
salt
;
take
them
,
take
them

"
  
<EOS>
Captain
Benwick
obey
,
and
Charles
at
the
same
moment
,
disengage
himself
from
his
wife
,
they
be
both
with
him
;
and
Louisa
be
raise
up
and
support
more
firmly
between
them
,
and
everything
be
do
that
Anne
have
prompt
,
but
in
vain
;
while
Captain
Wentworth
,
stagger
against
the
wall
for
his
support
,
exclaim
in
the
bitter
agony
    
"
oh
God

him
at
once

a
moment

the
poor
corpse

Captain

who

affectionate

over
Louisa
with

grief

could
only
turn
his
eye
from
one
sister

to
see
the
other
in
a
state
as
insensible

or
to

the
hysterical
agitation

his
wife

at
interval

comfort
to
the

to

to

looking
of
these
good
people
Henrietta
be
consign
,
for
,
though

she
be
quite
helpless

manner

by
her
side

and
Charles
attend
to
his
wife

they
set
forward

tread
back
with
feeling
unutterable
,
the
ground

which
so
lately
,
so
very
lately
,
and
so
light
of
heart

they
have

along

<EOS>
They
be
not
off
the
Cobb

before
the
Harvilles

them

<EOS>
Captain
Benwick
have
be
see
fly
by
their
house
,
with
a
countenance
which
show
something
to
be
wrong
;
and
they
have
set
off
immediately
,
inform
and
direct
as
they
pass

towards
the
spot
.
<EOS>
shock
as
Captain
Harville
be
,
he
bring
sense
and
nerve
that
could
be
instantly
useful
;
and
a
look
between
him
and
<EOS>
his
wife
decide
what
be
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
take
to
their
house
;
all
must
go
to
their
house
;
and
await
the
surgeon
's
arrival
there
.
<EOS>
They
would
not
listen
to
scruple
:
he
be
obey
;
they
be
all
beneath
his
roof
;
and
while
Louisa
,
under
Mrs

's
direction
,
be

Louisa
have
once
open
her
eye
,
but
soon
close
them
again
,
without
apparent
consciousness
.
<EOS>
this
have
be
a
proof
of
life

of
service

her
sister

Louisa

<EOS>
there

It
now
become
necessary
for
the
party
to
consider
what
be
good
to
be
do
,
as
to
their
general
situation
.
<EOS>
They
be
now
able
to
speak
to
each
other
and
consult
.
<EOS>
that
Louisa
must
remain
where
she
be
,
however
distress
to
her
friend
to
be
involve
the
Harvilles
in
such
trouble

do
not
admit
a
doubt

<EOS>
Her
removal
be
impossible

<EOS>
the
Harvilles
silence
all
scruple
;
and
,
as
much
as
they
could
,
all
gratitude
.
<EOS>
They
have
look
forward
and
arrange
everything
before
the
other
begin
to
reflect
.
<EOS>
Captain
Benwick
must
give
up
his
room
to
them
,
and
get
another
bed
elsewhere
;
and
the
whole
be
settle
.
<EOS>
They
be
only
concerned
that
the
house
could
accommodate
no
more
;
and
yet
perhaps
,
by
"
put
the
child
away
in
the
maid
's
room
,
or
swinge
a
cot
somewhere
,
"
they
could
hardly
bear
to
think
of
not
find
room
for
two
or
three
besides
,
suppose
they
may
wish
to
stay
;
though
,
with
regard
to
any
attendance
on
Miss
Musgrove
,
there
need
not
be
the
least
uneasiness
in
leave
her
to
Mrs
Harville
's
care
entirely
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Harville
be
a
very
experienced
nurse
,
and
her
nursery
-
maid
,
who
have
live
with
her
long
,
and
go
about
with
her
everywhere
,
be
just
such
another
.
<EOS>
between
these
two
,
she
could
want
no
possible
attendance
by
day
or
night
.
<EOS>
and
all
this
be

with
a
truth

sincerity

feel
irresistible

<EOS>
Charles
,
Henrietta
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
be
the
three
in

for

it

the

break
to
Mr

the
lateness
of

an

the
impossibility

"
at
first
,
they
be
capable
of
nothing
more
to
the
purpose
than
such
exclamation
;
but
,
after
a
while
,
Captain
Wentworth
,
exert
himself
,
say
    
"
We
must
be
decide
,
and
without
the
loss
of
another
minute

valuable

some

<EOS>

either
you
or
I
must
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
Charles
agree
,
but
declare
his
resolution
of
not
go
away
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
as
little
incumbrance
as
possible
to
Captain
and
Mrs
Harville
;
but
as
to
leave
his
sister
in
such
a
state
,
he
neither
ought
,
nor
would
.
<EOS>
so
far
it
be
decide
;
and
Henrietta
at
first
declare
the
same
.
<EOS>
She
,
however
,
be
soon
persuade
to
think
differently
.
<EOS>
the
usefulness
of
her
staying
!
<EOS>
She
who
have
not
be
able
to
remain
in
Louisa
's
room
,
or
to
look
at
her
,
without
suffering
which
make
her
bad
than
helpless
!
<EOS>
She
be
force
to
acknowledge
that
she
could
do
no
good
,
yet
be
still
unwilling
to
be
away
,
till
,
touch
by
the
thought
of
her
father
and
mother
<EOS>
,
she
give
it
up
;
she
consent
,
she
be
anxious
to
be
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
the
plan
have
reach
this
point
,
when
Anne
,
come
quietly
down
from
Louisa
's
room
,
could
not
but
hear
what
follow
,
for
the
parlour
door
be
open
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
it
be
settle
,
Musgrove
,
"
cry
Captain
Wentworth
,
"
that
you
stay
,
and
that
I
take
care
of
your
sister
home
.
<EOS>
but
as
to
the
rest
,
as
to
the
other
,
if
one
stay
to
assist
Mrs
Harville
,
I
think
it
nee
be
only
one
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Charles
Musgrove
will
,
of
course
,
wish
to
get
back
to
her
child
;
but
if
Anne
will
stay
,
no
one
so
proper
,
so
capable
as
Anne
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
pause
a
moment
to
recover
from
the
emotion
of
hear
herself
so
spoken
of
.
<EOS>
the
other
two
warmly
agree
with
what
he
say
,
and
she
then
appear
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
stay
,
I
be
sure
;
you
will
stay
and
nurse
her
;
"
cry
he
,
turn
to
her
and
speak
with
a
glow
,
and
yet
a
gentleness
,
which
seem
almost
restore
the
past
.
<EOS>
She
colour
deeply
,
and
he
recollect
himself
and
move
away
.
<EOS>
She
express
herself
most
willing
,
ready
,
happy
to
remain
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
what
she
have
be
think
of
,
and
wish
to
be
allow
to
do
.
<EOS>
a
bed
on
the
floor
in
Louisa
's
room
would
be
sufficient
for
her
,
if
Mrs
Harville
would
but
think
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
one
thing
more
,
and
all
seem
arrange
.
<EOS>
though
it
be
rather
desirable
that
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
should
be
previously
alarm
by
some
share
of
delay
;
yet
the
time
require
by
the
Uppercross
horse
to
take
them
back
,
would
be
a
dreadful
extension
of
suspense
;
and
Captain
Wentworth
propose
,
and
Charles
Musgrove
agree
,
that
it
would
be
much
well
for
him
to
take
a
chaise
from
the
inn
,
and
leave
Mr
Musgrove
's
carriage
and
horse
to
be
send
home
the
next
morning
early
,
when
there
would
be
the
farth
advantage
of
send
an
account
of
Louisa
's
night
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
now
hurry
off
to
get
everything
ready
on
his
part
,
and
to
be
soon
follow
by
the
two
lady
.
<EOS>
when
the
plan
be
make
known
to
Mary
,
however
,
there
be
an
end
of
all
peace
in
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
wretched
and
so
vehement
,
complain
so
much
of
injustice
in
be
expect
to
go
away
instead
of
Anne
;
Anne
,
who
be
nothing
to
Louisa
,
while
she
be
her
sister
,
and
have
the
good
right
to
stay
in
Henrietta
's
stead
!
<EOS>
why
be
not
she
to
be
as
useful
as
Anne
?
<EOS>
and
to
go
home
without
Charles
,
too
,
without
her
husband
!
<EOS>
no
,
it
be
too
unkind
.
<EOS>
and
in
short
,
she
say
more
than
her
husband
could
long
withstand
,
and
as
none
of
the
other
could
oppose
when
he
give
way
,
there
be
no
help
for
it
;
the
change
of
Mary
for
Anne
be
inevitable
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
have
never
submit
more
reluctantly
to
the
jealous
and
ill
-
judge
claim
of
Mary
;
but
so
it
must
be
,
and
they
set
off
for
the
town
,
Charles
take
care
of
his
sister
,
and
Captain
Benwick
attend
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
give
a
moment
's
recollection
,
as
they
hurry
along
,
to
the
little
circumstance
which
the
same
spot
have
witness
earlier
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
there
she
have
listen
to
Henrietta
's
scheme
for
Dr
Shirley
's
leave
Uppercross
;
farther
on
,
she
have
first
see
Mr
Elliot
;
a
moment
seem
all
that
could
now
be
give
to
any
one
but
Louisa
,
or
those
who
be
wrapt
up
in
her
welfare
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Benwick
be
most
considerately
attentive
to
her
;
and
,
unite
as
they
all
seem
by
the
distress
of
the
day
,
she
feel
an
increase
degree
of
good
-
will
towards
him
,
and
a
pleasure
even
in
think
that
it
may
,
perhaps
,
be
the
occasion
of
continue
their
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
be
on
the
watch
for
them
,
and
a
chaise
and
four
in
wait
,
station
for
their
convenience
in
the
low
part
of
the
street
;
but
his
evident
surprise
and
vexation
at
the
substitution
of
one
sister
for
the
other
,
the
change
in
his
countenance
,
the
astonishment
,
the
expression
begin
and
suppress
,
with
which
Charles
be
listen
to
,
make
but
a
mortifying
reception
of
Anne
;
or
must
at
least
convince
her
that
she
be
value
only
as
she
could
be
useful
to
Louisa
.
  
<EOS>
She
endeavour
to
be
compose
,
and
to
be
just
.
<EOS>
without
emulate
the
feeling
of
an
Emma
towards
her
Henry
,
she
would
have
attend
on
Louisa
with
a
zeal
above
the
common
claim
of
regard
,
for
his
sake
;
and
she
hope
he
would
not
long
be
so
unjust
as
to
suppose
she
would
shrink
unnecessarily
from
the
office
of
a
friend
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
mean
while
she
be
in
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
He
have
hand
them
both
in
,
and
place
himself
between
them
;
and
in
this
manner
,
under
these
circumstance
,
full
of
astonishment
and
emotion
to
Anne
,
she
quit
Lyme
.
<EOS>
how
the
long
stage
would
pass
;
how
it
be
to
affect
their
manner
;
what
be
to
be
their
sort
of
intercourse
,
she
could
not
foresee
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
quite
natural
,
however
.
<EOS>
He
be
devoted
to
Henrietta
;
always
turn
towards
her
;
and
when
he
speak
at
all
,
always
with
the
view
of
support
her
hope
and
raise
her
spirit
.
<EOS>
in
general
,
his
voice
and
manner
be
studiously
calm
.
<EOS>
to
spare
Henrietta
from
agitation
seem
the
govern
principle
.
<EOS>
once
only
,
when
she
have
be
grieve
over
the
last
ill
-
judge
,
ill
-
fate
walk
to
the
Cobb
,
bitterly
lament
that
it
ever
have
be
think
of
,
he
burst
forth
,
as
if
wholly
overcome
    
"
do
not
talk
of
it
,
do
not
talk
of
it
,
"
he
cry
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
God
!
<EOS>
that
I
have
not
give
way
to
her
at
the
fatal
moment
!
<EOS>
have
I
do
as
I
ought
!
<EOS>
but
so
eager
and
so
resolute
!
<EOS>
dear
,
sweet
Louisa
!
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
wonder
whether
it
ever
occur
to
him
now
,
to
question
the
justness
of
his
own
previous
opinion
as
to
the
universal
felicity
and
advantage
of
firmness
of
character
;
and
whether
it
may
not
strike
him
that
,
like
all
other
quality
of
the
mind
,
it
should
have
its
proportion
and
limit
.
<EOS>
She
think
it
could
scarcely
escape
him
to
feel
that
a
persuadable
temper
may
sometimes
be
as
much
in
favour
of
happiness
as
a
very
resolute
character
.
  
<EOS>
They
get
on
fast
.
<EOS>
Anne
be
astonish
to
recognise
the
same
hill
and
the
same
object
so
soon
.
<EOS>
Their
actual
speed
,
heighten
by
some
dread
of
the
conclusion
,
make
the
road
appear
<EOS>
but
half
as
long
as
on
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
It
be
grow
quite
dusk
,
however
,
before
they
be
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Uppercross
,
and
there
have
be
total
silence
among
them
for
some
time
,
Henrietta
lean
back
in
the
corner
,
with
a
shawl
over
her
face
,
give
the
hope
of
her
have
cry
herself
to
sleep
;
when
,
as
they
be
go
up
their
last
hill
,
Anne
find
herself
all
at
once
address
by
Captain
Wentworth
.
<EOS>
in
a
low
,
cautious
voice
,
he
say
:
    
"
I
have
be
consider
what
we
have
best
do
.
<EOS>
She
must
not
appear
at
first
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
stand
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
think
whether
you
have
not
better
remain
in
the
carriage
with
her
,
while
I
go
in
and
break
it
to
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
.
<EOS>
do
you
think
this
be
a
good
plan
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
do
:
<EOS>
he
be
satisfied
,
and
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
but
the
remembrance
of
the
appeal
remain
a
pleasure
to
her
,
as
a
proof
of
friendship
,
and
of
deference
for
her
judgement
,
a
great
pleasure
;
and
when
it
become
a
sort
of
part
proof
,
its
value
do
not
lessen
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
distress
communication
at
Uppercross
be
over
,
and
he
have
see
the
father
and
mother
quite
as
compose
as
could
be
hope
,
and
the
daughter
all
the
well
for
be
with
them
,
he
announce
his
intention
of
return
in
the
same
carriage
to
Lyme
;
and
when
the
horse
be
bait
,
he
be
off

They

<EOS>
in

he
seem
unable

of

She

good

He
almost
wish
she
have
be
prevail
on
to
come
home
the
day
before
;
but
the
truth
be
,
that
Mrs
Harville
leave
nothing
for
anybody
to
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
Charles
be
to
return
to
Lyme
the
same
afternoon
,
and
his
father
have
at
first
half
a
mind
to
go
with
him
,
but
the
lady
could
not
consent
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
go
only
to
multiply
trouble
to
the
other
,
and
increase
his
own
distress
;
and
a
much
well
scheme
follow
and
be
act
upon
.
<EOS>
a
chaise
be
send
for
from
Crewkherne
,
and
Charles
convey
back
a
far
more
useful
person
in
the
old
nursery
-
maid
of
the
family
,
one
who
have
bring
up
all
the
child
,
and

the
very
last
,
the
linger
and
long

pet
Master
Harry

school
after
his
brother
,
be
now
live
in
her
desert
nursery
to
mend
stocking
and
dress
all
the
blain
and
bruise
she
could
get
near
her
,
and
who
,
consequently
,
be
only
too
happy
in
be
allow
to
go
and
help
nurse
dear
Miss
Louisa
.
<EOS>
vague
wish
of
get
Sarah
thither
,
have
occur
before
to
Mrs
Musgrove
and
Henrietta
;
but
without
Anne
,
it
would
hardly
have
be
resolve
on
,
and
find
practicable
so
soon
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
indebte
,
the
next
day
,
to
Charles
Hayter
,
for
all
the
minute
knowledge
of
Louisa
,
which
it
be
so
essential
to
obtain
every
twenty
-
four
hour
.
<EOS>
He
make
it
his
business
to
go
to
Lyme
,
and
his
account
be
still
encouraging
.
<EOS>
the
interval
of
sense
and
consciousness
be
believe
to
be
strong
.
<EOS>
every
report
agree
in
Captain
Wentworth
's
appear
fix
in
Lyme
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
be
to
leave
them
on
the
morrow
,
an
event
which
they
all
dread
.
<EOS>
"
what
should
they
do
without
her
?
<EOS>
They
be
wretched
comforter
for
one
another
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
much
be
say
in
this
way
,
that
Anne
think
she
could
not
do
better
than
impart
among
them
the
general
inclination
to
which
she
be
privy
,
and
persuade
them
all
to
go
to
Lyme
at
once
.
<EOS>
She
have
little
difficulty
;
it
be
soon
determine
that
they
would
go
;
go
to
-
morrow
,
fix
themselves
at
the
inn
,
or
get
into
lodging
,
as
it
suit
,
and
there
remain
till
dear
Louisa
could
be
move
.
<EOS>
They
must
be
take
off
some
trouble
from
the
good
people
she
be
with
;
they
may
at
least
relieve
Mrs
Harville
from
the
care
of
her
own
child
;
and
in
short
,
they
be
so
happy
in
the
decision
,
that
Anne
be
delighted
with
what
she
have
do
,
and
feel
that
she
could
not
spend
her
last
morning
at
Uppercross
better
than
in
assist
their
preparation
,
and
send
them
off
at
an
early
hour
,
though
her
be
leave
to
the
solitary
range
of
the
house
be
the
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
the
last
,
except
the
little
boy
at
the
cottage
<EOS>
,
she
be
the
very
last
,
the
only
remain
one
of
all
that
have
fill
and
animate
both
house
,
of
all
that
have
give
Uppercross
its
cheerful
character
.
<EOS>
a
few
day
have
make
a
change
indeed
!
  
<EOS>
if
Louisa
recover
,
it
would
all
be
well
again
.
<EOS>
More
than
former
happiness
would
be
restore
.
<EOS>
there
could
not
be
a
doubt
,
to
her
mind
there
be
none
,
of
what
would
follow
her
recovery
.
<EOS>
a
few
month
hence
,
and
the
room
now
so
deserted
,
occupy
but
by
her
silent
,
pensive
self
,
may
be
fill
again
with
all
that
be
happy
and
gay
,
all
that
be
glowing
and
bright
in
prosperous
love
,
all
that
be
most
unlike
Anne
Elliot
!
  
<EOS>
an
hour
's
complete
leisure
for
such
reflection
as
these
,
on
a
dark
November
day
,
a
small
thick
rain
almost
blot
out
the
very
few
object
ever
to
be
discern
from
the
window
,
be
enough
to
make
the
sound
of
Lady
Russell
's
carriage
exceedingly
welcome
;
and
yet
,
though
desirous
to
be
go
,
she
could
not
quit
the
Mansion
House
,
or
look
an
adieu
to
the
Cottage
,
with
its
black
,
dripping
and
comfortless
veranda
,
or
even
notice
through
the
misty
glass
the
last
humble
tenement
of
the
village
,
without
a
sadden
heart
.
<EOS>
scene
have
pass
in
Uppercross
which
make
it
precious
.
<EOS>
It
stand
the
record
of
many
sensation
of
pain
,
once
severe
,
but
now
soften
;
and
of
some
instance
of
relent
feeling
,
some
breathing
of
friendship
and
reconciliation
,
which
could
never
be
look
for
again
,
and
which
could
never
cease
to
be
dear
.
<EOS>
She
leave
it
all
behind
her
,
all
but
the
recollection
that
such
thing
have
be
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
have
never
enter
Kellynch
since
her
quit
Lady
Russell
's
house
in
September
.
<EOS>
It
have
not
be
necessary
,
and
the
few
occasion
of
its
be
possible
for
her
to
go
to
the
Hall
she
have
contrive
to
evade
and
escape
from
.
<EOS>
Her
first
return
be
to
resume
her
place
in
the
modern
and
elegant
apartment
of
the
Lodge
,
and
to
gladden
the
eye
of
its
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
some
anxiety
mix
with
Lady
Russell
's
joy
in
meet
her
.
<EOS>
She
know
who
have
be
frequent
Uppercross
.
<EOS>
but
happily
,
either
Anne
be
improve
in
plumpness
and
look
,
or
Lady
Russell
fancy
her
so
;
and
Anne
,
in
receive
her
compliment
on
the
occasion
,
have
the
amusement
of
connect
them
with
the
silent
admiration
of
her
cousin
,
and
of
hope
that
she
be
to
be
bless
with
a
second
spring
of
youth
and
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
come
to
converse
,
she
be
soon
sensible
of
some
mental
change
.
<EOS>
the
subject
of
which
her
heart
have
be
full
on
leave
Kellynch
,
and
which
she
have
feel
slight
,
and
be
compel
to
smother
among
the
Musgroves
,
be
now
become
but
of
secondary
interest
.
<EOS>
She
have
lately
lose
sight
even
of
her
father
and
sister
and
Bath
.
<EOS>
Their
concern
have
be
sink
under
those
of
Uppercross
;
and
when
Lady
Russell
revert
to
their
former
hope
and
fear
,
and
speak
her
satisfaction
in
the
house
in
Camden
Place
,
which
have
be
take
,
and
her
regret
that
Mrs
Clay
should
still
be
with
them
,
Anne
would
have
be
ashamed
to
have
it
know
how
much
more
she
be
think
of
Lyme
and
Louisa
Musgrove
,
and
all
her
acquaintance
there
;
how
much
more
interesting
to
her
be
the
home
and
the
friendship
of
the
Harvilles
and
Captain
Benwick
,
than
her
own
father
's
house
in
Camden
Place
,
or
her
own
sister
's
intimacy
with
Mrs
Clay
.
<EOS>
She
be
actually
force
to
exert
herself
to
meet
Lady
Russell
with
anything
like
the
appearance
of
equal
solicitude
,
on
topic
which
have
by
nature
the
first
claim
on
her
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
awkwardness
at
first
in
their
discourse
on
another
subject
.
<EOS>
They
must
speak
of
the
accident
at
Lyme
.
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
have
not
be
arrive
five
minute
the
day
before
,
when
a
full
account
of
the
whole
have
burst
on
her
;
but
still
it
must
be
talk
of
<EOS>
,
she
must
make
enquiry
,
she
must
regret
the
imprudence
,
lament
the
result
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
's
name
must
be
mention
by
both
.
<EOS>
Anne
be
conscious
of
not
do
it
so
well
as
Lady
Russell
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
speak
the
name
,
and
look
straight
forward
to
Lady
Russell
's
eye
,
till
she
have
adopt
the
expedient
of
tell
her
briefly
what
she
think
of
the
attachment
between
him
and
Louisa
.
<EOS>
when
this
be
tell
,
his
name
distress
her
no
longer
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
have
only
to
listen
composedly
,
and
wish
them
happy
,
but
internally
her
heart
revel
in
angry
pleasure
,
in
pleased
contempt
,
that
the
man
who
at
twenty
-
three
have
seem
to
understand
somewhat
of
the
value
of
an
Anne
Elliot
,
should
,
eight
year
afterwards
,
be
charm
by
a
Louisa
Musgrove
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
three
or
four
day
pass
most
quietly
,
with
no
circumstance
to
mark
them
except
the
receipt
of
a
note
or
two
from
Lyme
,
which
find
their
way
to
Anne
,
she
could
not
tell
how
,
and
bring
a
rather
improve
account
of
Louisa
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
that
period
,
Lady
Russell
's
politeness
could
repose
no
longer
,
and
the
fainter
self
-
threatening
of
the
past
become
in
a
decide
tone
,
"
I
must
call
on
Mrs
Croft
;
I
really
must
call
upon
her
soon
.
<EOS>
Anne
,
have
you
courage
to
go
with
me
,
and
pay
a
visit
in
that
house
?
<EOS>
It
will
be
some
trial
to
us
both
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
do
not
shrink
from
it
;
on
the
contrary
,
she
truly
feel
as
she
say
,
in
observe
    
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
be
very
likely
to
suffer
the
most
of
the
two
;
your
feeling
be
less
reconcile
to
the
change
than
mine
.
<EOS>
by
remain
in
the
neighbourhood
,
I
be
become
inure
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
could
have
say
more
on
the
subject
;
for
she
have
in
fact
<EOS>
so
high
an
opinion
of
the
Crofts
,
and
consider
her
father
so
very
fortunate
in
his
tenant
,
feel
the
parish
to
be
so
sure
of
a
good
example
,
and
the
poor
of
the
good
attention
and
relief
,
that
however
sorry
and
ashamed
for
the
necessity
of
the
removal
,
she
could
not
but
in
conscience
feel
that
they
be
go
who
deserve
not
to
stay
,
and
that
Kellynch
Hall
have
pass
into
well
hand
than
its
owner
'
.
<EOS>
these
conviction
must
unquestionably
have
their
own
pain
,
and
severe
be
its
kind
;
but
they
preclude
that
pain
which
Lady
Russell
would
suffer
in
enter
the
house
again
,
and
return
through
the
well
-
know
apartment
.
  
<EOS>
in
such
moment
Anne
have
no
power
of
say
to
herself
,
"
these
room
ought
to
belong
only
to
us
.
<EOS>
oh
,
how
fallen
in
their
destination
!
<EOS>
how
unworthily
occupy
!
<EOS>
an
ancient
family
to
be
so
drive
away
!
<EOS>
stranger
fill
their
place
!
"
<EOS>
no
,
except
when
she
think
of
her
mother
,
and
remember
where
she
have
be
use
to
sit
and
preside
,
she
have
no
sigh
of
that
description
to
heave
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Croft
always
meet
her
with
a
kindness
which
give
her
the
pleasure
of
fancy
herself
a
favourite
,
and
on
the
present
occasion
,
receive
her
in
that
house
,
there
be
particular
attention
.
  
<EOS>
the
sad
accident
at
Lyme
be
soon
the
prevail
topic
,
and
on
compare
their
late
account
of
the
invalid
,
it
appear
that
each
lady
date
her
intelligence
from
the
same
hour
of
yestermorn
;
that
Captain
Wentworth
have
be
in
Kellynch
yesterday
(
the
first
time
since
the
accident
)
,
have
bring
Anne
the
last
note
,
which
she
have
not
be
able
to
trace
the
exact
step
of
;
have
staid
a
few
hour
and
then
return
again
to
Lyme
,
and
without
any
present
intention
of
quit
it
any
more
.
<EOS>
He
have
enquire
after
her
,
she
find
,
particularly
;
have
express
his
hope
of
Miss
Elliot
<EOS>
's
not
be
the
bad
for
her
exertion
,
and
have
speak
of
those
exertion
as
great
.
<EOS>
this
be
handsome
,
and
give
her
more
pleasure
than
almost
anything
else
could
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
sad
catastrophe
itself
,
it
could
be
canvass
only
in
one
style
by
a
couple
of
steady
,
sensible
woman
,
whose
judgement
have
to
work
on
ascertained
event
;
and
it
be
perfectly
decide
that
it
have
be
the
consequence
of
much
thoughtlessness
and
much
imprudence
;
that
its
effect
be
most
alarming
,
and
that
it
be
frightful
to
think
,
how
long
Miss
Musgrove
's
recovery
may
yet
be
doubtful
,
and
how
liable
she
would
still
remain
to
suffer
from
the
concussion
hereafter
!
<EOS>
the
Admiral
wound
it
up
summarily
by
exclaim
    
"
ay
,
a
very
bad
business
indeed
.
<EOS>
a
new
sort
of
way
this
,
for
a
young
fellow
to
be
make
love
,
by
break
his
mistress
's
head
,
be
not
it
,
Miss
Elliot
?
<EOS>
this
be
break
a
head
and
give
a
plaster
,
truly
!
"
  
<EOS>
Admiral
Croft
's
manner
be
not
quite
of
the
tone
to
suit
Lady
Russell
,
but
they
delight
Anne
.
<EOS>
His
goodness
of
heart
and
simplicity
of
character
be
irresistible
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
this
must
be
very
bad
for
you
,
"
say
he
,
suddenly
rouse
from
a
little
reverie
,
"
to
be
come
and
find
us
here
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
recollect
it
before
,
I
declare
,
but
it
must
be
very
bad
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
do
not
stand
upon
ceremony
.
<EOS>
get
up
and
go
over
all
the
room
in
the
house
if
you
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
another
time
,
Sir
,
I
thank
you
,
not
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
whenever
it
suit
you
.
<EOS>
You
can
slip
in
from
the
shrubbery
at
any
time
;
and
there
you
will
find
we
keep
our
umbrella
hang
up
by
that
door
.
<EOS>
a
good
place
be
not
it
?
<EOS>
but
,
"
(
check
himself
)
,
"
you
will
not
think
it
a
good
place
,
for
your
be
always
keep
in
the
butler

room

<EOS>
ay
,
so
it
always
be
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
one
man
's
way
may
be
as
good
as
another
be
,
but
we
all
like
our
own
good
.
<EOS>
and
so
you
must
judge
for
yourself
,
whether
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
go
about
the
house
or
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
,
find
she
may
decline
it
,
do
so
,
very
gratefully
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
make
very
few
change
either
,
"
continue
the
Admiral
,
after
think
a
moment
.
"
<EOS>
very
few
.
<EOS>
We
tell
you
about
the
laundry
-
door
,
at
Uppercross
.
<EOS>
that
have
be
a
very
great
improvement
.
<EOS>
the
wonder
be
,
how
any
family
upon
earth
could
bear
with
the
inconvenience
of
its
opening
as
it
do
,
so
long
!
<EOS>
You
will
tell
Sir
Walter
what
we
have
do
,
and
that
Mr
Shepherd
think
it
the
great
improvement
the
house
ever
have
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
must
do
ourselves
the
justice
to
say
,
that
the
few
alteration
we
have
make
have
be
all
very
much
for
the
well
.
<EOS>
My
wife
should
have
the
credit
of
them
,
however
.
<EOS>
I
have
do
very
little
besides
send
away
some
of
the
large
looking
-
glass
from
my
dressing
-
room
,
which
be
your
father
's
.
<EOS>
a
very
good
man
,
and
very
much
the
gentleman
<EOS>
I
be
sure
:
<EOS>
but
I
should
think
,
Miss
Elliot
,
"
(
look
with
serious
reflection
)
<EOS>
,
"
I
should
think
he
must
be
rather
a
dressy
man
for
his
time
of
life
.
<EOS>
such
a
number
of
look
-
glass
!
<EOS>
oh
Lord
!
<EOS>
there
be
no
get
away
from
one
's
self
.
<EOS>
so
I
get
Sophy
to
lend
me
a
hand
,
and
we
soon
shift
their
quarter
;
and
now
I
be
quite
snug
,
with
my
little
shaving
glass
in
one
corner
,
and
another
great
thing
that
I
never
go
near
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
,
amuse
in
spite
of
herself
,
be
rather
distressed
for
an
answer
,
and
the
Admiral
,
fear
he
may
not
have
be
civil
enough
,
take
up
the
subject
again
,
to
say
    
"
the
next
time
you
write
to
your
good
father
,
Miss
Elliot
,
pray
give
him
my
compliment
and
Mrs
Croft
's
,
and
say
that
we
be
settle
here
quite
to
our
liking
,
and
have
no
fault
at
all
to
find
with
the
place
.
<EOS>
the
breakfast
-
room
chimney
smoke
a
little
,
I
grant
you
,
but
it
be
only
when
the
wind
be
due
north
and
blow
hard
,
which
may
not
happen
three
time
a
winter
.
<EOS>
and
take
it
altogether
,
now
that
we
have
be
into
most
of
the
house
hereabouts
and
can
judge
,
there
be
not
one
that
we
like
better
than
this
.
<EOS>
pray
say
so
,
with
my
compliment
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
glad
to
hear
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
and
Mrs
Croft
be
very
well
pleased
with
each
other
:
but
the
acquaintance
which
this
visit
begin
be
fate
not
to
proceed
far
at
present
;
for
when
it
be
return
,
the
Crofts
announce
themselves
to
be
go
away
for
a
few
week
,
to
visit
their
connexion
in
the
north
of
the
county
,
and
probably
may
not
be
at
home
again
before
Lady
Russell
would
be
remove
to
Bath
.
  
<EOS>
so
end
all
danger
to
Anne
of
meet
Captain
Wentworth
at
Kellynch
Hall
,
or
of
see
him
in
company
with
her
friend
.
<EOS>
everything
be
safe
enough
,
and
she
smile
over
the
many
anxious
feeling
she
have
waste
on
the
subject
.
    
<EOS>
though
Charles
and
Mary
have
remain
at
Lyme
much
longer
after
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
's
go
than
Anne
conceive
<EOS>
they
could
have
be
at
all
want
,
they
be
yet
the
first
of
the
family
to
be
at
home
again
;
and
as
soon
as
possible
after
their
return
to
Uppercross
they
drive
over
to
the
Lodge
.
<EOS>
They
have
leave
Louisa
begin
to
sit
up
;
but
her
head
,
though
clear
,
be
exceedingly
weak
,
and
her
nerve
susceptible
to
the
high
extreme
of
tenderness
;
and
though
she
may
be
pronounce
to
be
altogether
do
very
well
,
it
be
still
impossible
to
say
when
she
may
be
able
to
bear
the
removal
home
;
and
her
father
and
mother
,
who
must
return
in
time
to
receive
their
young
child
for
the
Christmas
holiday
,
have
hardly
a
hope
of
be
allow
to
bring
her
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
be
all
in
lodging
together
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Musgrove
have
get
Mrs
Harville
's
child
away
as
much
as
she
could
,
every
possible
supply
from
Uppercross
have
be
furnish
,
to
lighten
the
inconvenience
to
the
Harvilles
,
while
the
Harvilles
have
be
want
them
to
come
to
dinner
every
day
;
and
in
short
,
it
seem
to
have
be
only
a
struggle
on
each
side
as
to
which
should
be
most
disintereste
and
hospitable
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
have
have
her
evil
;
but
upon
the
whole
,
as
be
evident
by
her
stay
so
long
,
she
have
find
more
to
enjoy
than
to
suffer
.
<EOS>
Charles
Hayter
have
be
at
Lyme
oftener
than
suit
her
;
and
when
they
dine
with
the
Harvilles
there
have
be
only
a
maid
-
servant
to
wait
,
and
at
first
Mrs
Harville
have
always
give
Mrs
Musgrove
precedence
;
but
then
,
she
have
receive
so
very
handsome
an
apology
from
her
on
find
out
whose
daughter
she
be
,
and
there
have
be
so
much
go
on
every
day
,
there
have
be
so
many
walk
between
their
lodging
and
the
Harvilles
,
and
she
have
get
book
from
the
library
,
and
change
them
so
often
,
that
the
balance
have
certainly
be
much
in
favour
of
Lyme
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
take
to
Charmouth
too
,
and
she
have
bathe
,
and
she
have
go
to
church
,
and
there
be
a
great
many
more
people
to
look
at
in
the
church
at
Lyme
than
at
Uppercross
;
and
all
this
,
join
to
the
sense
of
be
so
very
useful
,
have
make
really
an
agreeable
fortnight
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
enquire
after
Captain
Benwick
,
Mary
's
face
be
cloud
directly
.
<EOS>
Charles
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Captain
Benwick
be
very
well
,
I
believe
,
but
he
be
a
very
odd
young
man
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
he
would
be
at
.
<EOS>
We
ask
him
to
come
home
with
us
for
a
day
or
two
:
<EOS>
Charles
undertake
to
give
him
some
shooting
,
and
he
seem
quite
delighted
,
and
,
for
my
part
,
I
think
it
be
all
settle
;
when
behold
!
<EOS>
on
Tuesday
night
,
he
make
a
very
awkward
sort
of
excuse
;
"
he
never
shoot
'
and
he
have
"
be
quite
misunderstood
,
"
and
he
have
promise
this
<EOS>
and
he
have
promise
that
,
and
<EOS>
the
end
of
it
be
,
I
find
,
that
he
do
not
mean
to
come
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
be
afraid
of
find
it
dull
;
but
upon
my
word
I
should
have
think
we
be
lively
enough
at
the
Cottage
for
such
a
heart
-
break
man
as
Captain
Benwick
.
"
  
<EOS>
Charles
laugh
again
and
say
,
"
now
Mary
,
you
know
very
well
how
it
really
be
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
your
doing
,
"
(
turn
to
Anne
.
)
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
fancy
that
if
he
go
with
us
,
he
should
find
you
close
by
:
he
fancy
everybody
to
be
live
in
Uppercross
;
and
when
he
discover
that
Lady
Russell
live
three
mile
off
,
his
heart
fail
him
,
and
he
have
not
courage
to
come
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
fact
,
upon
my
honour
,
Mary
know
it
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
Mary
do
not
give
into
it
very
graciously
,
whether
from
not
consider
Captain
Benwick
entitle
by
birth
and
situation
to
be
in
love
with
an
Elliot
,
or
from
not
want
to
believe
Anne
a
great
attraction
to
Uppercross
than
herself
,
must
be
leave
to
be
guess
.
<EOS>
Anne
's
good
-
will
,
however
,
be
not
to
be
lessen
by
what
she
hear
.
<EOS>
She
boldly
acknowledge
herself
flatter
,
and
continue
her
enquiry
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
<EOS>
he
talk
of
you
,
"
cry
Charles
,
"
in
such
term
 
<EOS>
"
Mary
interrupt
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
declare
,
Charles
,
I
never
hear
him
mention
Anne
twice
all
the
time
I
be
there
.
<EOS>
I
declare
,
Anne
,
he
never
talk
of
you
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
admit
Charles
,
"
I
do
not
know
that
he
ever
do
,
in
a
general
way
;
but
however
,
it
be
a
very
clear
thing
that
he
admire
you
exceedingly
.
<EOS>
His
head
be
full
of
some
book
that
he
be
read
upon
your
recommendation
,
and
he
want
to
talk
to
you
about
them
;
he
have
find
out
something
or
other
in
one
of
them
which
he
think
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
pretend
to
remember
it
,
but
it
be
something
very
fine
 
<EOS>
I
overhear
him
tell
Henrietta
all
about
it
;
and
then
"
Miss
Elliot
'
be
speak
of
in
the
high
term
!
<EOS>
now
Mary
,
I
declare
it
be
so
<EOS>
,
I
hear
it
myself
,
and
you
be
in
the
other
room
.
<EOS>
"
elegance
,
sweetness
,
beauty
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
there
be
no
end
of
Miss
Elliot
's
charm
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
I
be
sure
,
"
cry
Mary
,
warmly
,
"
it
be
a
very
little
to
his
credit
,
if
he
do
.
<EOS>
Miss
Harville
only
die
last
June
.
<EOS>
such
a
heart
be
very
little
worth
have
;
be
it
,
Lady
Russell
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
will
agree
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
Captain
Benwick
before
I
decide
,
"
say
Lady
Russell
,
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
that
you
be
very
likely
to
do
very
soon
,
I
can
tell
you
,
madam
,
"
say
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
though
he
have
not
nerve
for
come
away
with
us
,
and
set
off
again
afterwards
to
pay
a
formal
visit
here
,
he
will
make
his
way
over
to
Kellynch
one
day
by
himself
,
you
may
depend
on
it
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
the
distance
and
the
road
,
and
I
tell
him
of
the
church
's
be
so
very
well
worth
see
;
for
as
he
have
a
taste
for
those
sort
of
thing
<EOS>
,
I
think
that
would
be
a
good
excuse
,
and
he
listen
with
all
his
understanding
and
soul
;
and
I
be
sure
from
his
manner
that
you
will
have
him
call
here
soon
.
<EOS>
so
,
I
give
you
notice
,
Lady
Russell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
any
acquaintance
of
Anne
's
will
always
be
welcome
to
me
,
"
be
Lady
Russell
's
kind
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
<EOS>
as
to
be
Anne
's
acquaintance
,
"
say
Mary
,
"
I
think
he
be
rather
my
acquaintance
,
for
I
have
be
see
him
every
day
this
last
fortnight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
as
your
joint
acquaintance
,
then
,
I
shall
be
very
happy
to
see
Captain
Benwick
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
find
anything
very
agreeable
in
him
,
I
assure
you
,
madam
.
<EOS>
He
be
one
of
the
dull
young
man
that
ever
live
.
<EOS>
He
have
walk
with
me
,
sometimes
,
from
one
end
of
the
sand
to
the
other
,
without
say
a
word
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
at
all
a
well
-
breed
young
man
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
will
not
like
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
we
differ
,
Mary
,
"
say
Anne
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
Lady
Russell
would
like
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
would
be
so
much
pleased
with
his
mind
,
that
she
would
very
soon
see
no
deficiency
in
his
manner
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
so
do
I
,
Anne
,
"
say
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
Lady
Russell
would
like
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
just
Lady
Russell
's
sort
.
<EOS>
give
him
a
book
,
and
he
will
read
all
day
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
that
he
will
!
<EOS>
"
exclaim
Mary
,
tauntingly
.
"
<EOS>
He
will
sit
pore
over
his
book
,
and
not
know
when
a
person
speak
to
him
,
or
when
one
drop
's
one
's
scissor
,
or
anything
that
happen
.
<EOS>
do
you
think
Lady
Russell
would
like
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
could
not
help
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
should
not
have
suppose
that
my
opinion
of
any
one
could
have
admit
of
such
difference
of
conjecture
,
steady
and
matter
of
fact
as
I
may
call
myself
.
<EOS>
I
have
really
a
curiosity
to
see
the
person
who
can
give
occasion
to
such
directly
opposite
notion
.
<EOS>
I
wish
he
may
be
induce
to
call
here
.
<EOS>
and
when
he
do
,
Mary
,
you
may
depend
upon
hear
my
opinion
;
but
I
be
determine
not
to
judge
him
beforehand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
like
him
,
I
will
answer
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
begin
talk
of
something
else
.
<EOS>
Mary
speak
with
animation
of
their
meeting
with
,
or
rather
missing
,
Mr
Elliot
so
extraordinarily
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
man
,
"
say
Lady
Russell
,
"
whom
I
have
no
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
His
declining
to
be
on
cordial
term
with
the
head
of
his
family
,
have
leave
a
very
strong
impression
in
his
disfavour
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
decision
check
Mary
's
eagerness
,
and
stop
her
short
in
the
midst
of
the
Elliot
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
with
regard
to
Captain
Wentworth
,
though
Anne
hazard
no
enquiry
,
there
be
voluntary
communication
sufficient
.
<EOS>
His
spirit
have
be
greatly
recover
lately
as
may
be
expect
.
<EOS>
as
Louisa
improve
,
he
have
improve
,
and
he
be
now
quite
a
different
creature
from
what
he
have
be
the
first
week
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
see
Louisa
;
and
be
so
extremely
fearful
of
any
ill
consequence
to
her
from
an
interview
,
that
he
do
not
press
for
it
at
all
;
and
,
on
the
contrary
,
seem
to
have
a
plan
of
go
away
for
a
week
or
ten
day
,
till
her
head
be
strong
.
<EOS>
He
have
talk
of
go
down
to
Plymouth
for
a
week
,
and
want
to
persuade
Captain
Benwick
to
go
with
him
;
but
,
as
Charles
maintain
to
the
last
,
Captain
Benwick
seem
much
more
disposed
to
ride
over
to
Kellynch
.
  
<EOS>
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
Lady
Russell
and
Anne
be
both
occasionally
think
of
Captain
Benwick
,
from
this
time
.
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
could
not
hear
the
door
-
bell
without
feel
that
it
may
be
his
herald
;
nor
could
Anne
return
from
any
stroll
of
solitary
indulgence
in
her
father
's
ground
,
or
any
visit
of
charity
in
the
village
,
without
wonder
whether
she
may
see
him
or
hear
of
him
.
<EOS>
Captain
Benwick
come
not
,
however
.
<EOS>
He
be
either
less
disposed
for
it
than
Charles
have
imagine
,
or
he
be
too
shy
;
and
after
give
him
a
week
's
indulgence
,
Lady
Russell
determine
him
to
be
unworthy
of
the
interest
which
he
have
be
begin
to

<EOS>
when

afterwards
,
be
enter
Bath
on
a
wet
afternoon
,
and
drive
through
the
long
course
of
street
from
the
Old
Bridge
to
Camden
Place
,
amidst
the
dash
of

the
heavy
rumble

the
bawling

no

no

these

noise
which

She
persist
in
a
very
determined

very
silent
disinclination

Bath

catch
the
first
dim
view
of
the
extensive
building
,
smoke
in
rain
,
without
any
wish
of
see
them
better
;
feel
their
progress
through
the
street
to
be

however
disagreeable
,
yet
too
rapid
;
for
who
would
be
glad
to
see
her
when
she
arrive
?
<EOS>

with
fond
regret

<EOS>
Elizabeth

last
letter
have
communicate
a
piece
of
news
of
some
interest
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
be
in
Bath
.
<EOS>
He
have
call
in
Camden
Place
;
have
call
a
second
time
,
a
third
;
have
be
pointedly
attentive
.
<EOS>
if
Elizabeth
and
her
father
do
not
deceive
themselves
,
have
be
take
much
pain
to
seek
the
acquaintance
,
and
proclaim
the
value
of
the
connection
,
as
he
have
formerly
take
pain
to
shew
neglect
.
<EOS>
this
be
very
wonderful
if
it
be
true
;
and
Lady
Russell
be
in
a
state
of
very
agreeable
curiosity
and
perplexity
about
Mr
Elliot
,
already
recant
the
sentiment
she
have
so
lately
express
to
Mary
,
of
his
be
"
a
man
whom
she
have
no
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
"
She
have
a
great
wish
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
if
he
really
seek
to
reconcile
himself
like
a
dutiful
branch
,
he
must
be
forgive
for
have
dismember
himself
from
the
paternal
tree
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
be
not
animate
to
an
equal
pitch
by
the
circumstance
,
but
she
feel
that
she
would
rather
see
Mr
Elliot
again
than
not
,
which
be
more
than
she
could
say
for
many
other
person
in
Bath
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
put
down
in
Camden
Place
;
and
Lady
Russell
then
drive
to
her
own
lodging
,
in
Rivers
Street
.
    
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
have
take
a
very
good
house
in
Camden
Place
,
a
lofty
dignified
situation
,
such
as
become
a
man
of
consequence
;
and
both
he
and
Elizabeth
be
settle
there
,
much
to
their
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
enter
it
with
a
sink
heart
,
anticipate
an
imprisonment
of
many
month
,
and
anxiously
say
to
herself
,
"
oh
!
<EOS>
when
shall
I
leave
you
again
?
"
<EOS>
a
degree
of
unexpected
cordiality
,
however
,
in
the
welcome
she
receive
,
do
her
good
.
<EOS>
Her
father
and
sister
be
glad
to
see
her
,
for
the
sake
of
shew
her
the
house
and
furniture
,
and
meet
her
with
kindness
.
<EOS>
Her
make
a
fourth
,
when
they
sit
down
to
dinner
,
be
notice
as
an
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Clay
be
very
pleasant
,
and
very
smiling
,
but
her
courtesy
and
smile
be
more
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
Anne
have
always
feel
that
she
would
pretend
what
be
proper
on
her
arrival
,
but
the
complaisance
of
the
other
be
unlooke
for
.
<EOS>
They
be
evidently
in
excellent
spirit
,
and
she
be
soon
to
listen
to
the
cause
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
inclination
to
listen
to
her
.
<EOS>
after
lay
out
for
some
compliment
of
be
deeply
regretted
in
their
old
neighbourhood
,
which
Anne
could
not
pay
,
they
have
only
a
few
faint
enquiry
to
make
,
before
the
talk
must
be
all
their
own
.
<EOS>
uppercross
excite
no
interest
,
Kellynch
very
little
:
it
be
all
Bath
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
the
pleasure
of
assure
her
that
Bath
more
than
answer
their
expectation
in
every
respect
.
<EOS>
Their
house
be
undoubtedly
the
good
in
Camden
Place
;
their
drawing
-
room
have
many
decide
advantage
over
all
the
other
which
they
have
either
see
or
hear
of
,
and
the
superiority
be
not
less
in
the
style
of
the
fitting
-
up
,
or
the
taste
of
the
furniture
.
<EOS>
Their
acquaintance
be
exceedingly
seek
after
.
<EOS>
everybody
be
want
to
visit
them
.
<EOS>
They
have
draw
back
from
many
introduction
,
and
still
be
perpetually
have
card
leave
by
people
of
whom
they
know
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
here
be
fund
of
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
Could
Anne
wonder
that
her
father
and
sister
be
happy
?
<EOS>
She
may
not
wonder
,
but
she
must
sigh
that
her
father
should
feel
no
degradation
in
his
change
,
should
see
nothing
to
regret
in
the
duty
and
dignity
of
the
resident
landholder
,
should
find
so
much
to
be
vain
of
in
the
littleness
of
a
town
;
and
she
must
sigh
,
and
smile
,
and
wonder
too
,
as
Elizabeth
throw
open
the
fold
-
door
and
walk
with
exultation
from
one
drawing
-
room
to
the
other
,
boasting
of
their
space
;
at
the
possibility
of
that
woman
,
who
have
be
mistress
of
Kellynch
Hall
,
find
extent
to
be
proud
of
between
two
wall
,
perhaps
thirty
foot
asunder
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
all
which
they
have
to
make
them
happy
.
<EOS>
They
have
Mr
Elliot
too
.
<EOS>
Anne
have
a
great
deal
to
hear
of
Mr
Elliot
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
only
pardon
,
they
be
delighted
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
in
Bath
about
a
fortnight
;
(
he
have
pass
through
Bath
in
November
,
in
his
way
to
London
,
when
the
intelligence
of
Sir
Walter
's
be
settle
there
have
of
course
reach
him
,
though
only
twenty
-
four
hour
in
the
place
,
but
he
have
not
be
able
to
avail
himself
of
it
;
)
but
he
have
now
be
a
fortnight
in
Bath
,
and
his
first
object
on
arrive
,
have
be
to
leave
his
card
in
Camden
Place
,
follow
it
up
by
such
assiduous
endeavour
to
meet
,
and
when
they
do
meet
,
by
such
great
openness
of
conduct
,
such
readiness
to
apologize
for
the
past
,
such
solicitude
to
be
receive
as
a
relation
again
,
that
their
former
good
understanding
be
completely
re
-
establish
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
not
a
fault
to
find
in
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
explain
away
all
the
appearance
of
neglect
on
his
own
side
.
<EOS>
It
have
originate
in
misapprehension
entirely
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
have
an
idea
of
throw
himself
off
;
he
have
fear
that
he
be
throw
off
,
but
know
not
why
,
and
delicacy
have
keep
him
silent
.
<EOS>
upon
the
hint
of
have
speak
disrespectfully
or
carelessly
of
the
family
and
the
family
honour
,
he
be
quite
indignant
.
<EOS>
He
,
who
have
ever
boast
of
be
an
Elliot
,
and
whose
feeling
,
as
to
connection
,
be
only
too
strict
to
suit
the
unfeudal
tone
of
the
present
day
.
<EOS>
He
be
astonish
,
indeed
,
but
his
character
and
general
conduct
must
refute
it
.
<EOS>
He
could
refer
Sir
Walter
to
all
who
know
him
;
and
certainly
,
the
pain
he
have
be
take
on
this
,
the
first
opportunity
of
reconciliation
,
to
be
restore
to
the
footing
of
a
relation
and
heir
-
presumptive
,
be
a
strong
proof
of
his
opinion
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
the
circumstance
of
his
marriage
,
too
,
be
find
to
admit
of
much
extenuation
.
<EOS>
this
be
an
article
not
to
be
enter
on
by
himself
;
but
a
very
intimate
friend
of
his
,
a
Colonel
Wallis
,
a
highly
respectable
man
,
perfectly
the
gentleman
,
(
and
not
an
ill
-
looking
man
,
Sir
Walter
add
)
,
who
be
live
in
very
good
style
in
Marlborough
Buildings
,
and
have
,
at
his
own
particular
request
,
be
admit
to
their
acquaintance
through
Mr
Elliot
,
<EOS>
have
mention
one
or
two
thing
relative
to
the
marriage
,
which
make
a
material
difference
in
the
discredit
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Colonel
Wallis
have
know
Mr
Elliot
long
,
have
be
well
acquaint
also
with
his
wife
,
have
perfectly
understand
the
whole
story
.
<EOS>
She
be
certainly
not
a
woman
of
family
,
but
well
educated
,
accomplish
,
rich
,
and
excessively
in
love
with
his
friend
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
the
charm
.
<EOS>
She
have
seek
him
.
<EOS>
without
that
attraction
,
not
all
her
money
would
have
tempt
Elliot
,
and
Sir
Walter
be
,
moreover
,
assure
of
her
have
be
a
very
fine
woman
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
great
deal
to
soften
the
business
.
<EOS>
a
very
fine
woman
with
a
large
fortune
,
in
love
with
him
!
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
seem
to
admit
it
as
complete
apology
;
and
though
Elizabeth
could
not
see
the
circumstance
in
quite
so
favourable
a
light
,
she
allow
it
be
a
great
extenuation
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
have
call
repeatedly
,
have
dine
with
them
once
,
evidently
delight
by
the
distinction
of
be
ask
,
for
they
give
no
dinner
in
general
;
delighted
,
in
short
,
by
every
proof
of
cousinly
notice
,
and
place
his
whole
happiness
in
be
on
intimate
term
in
Camden
Place
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
listen
,
but
without
quite
understand
it
.
<EOS>
allowance
,
large
allowance
,
she
know
,
must
be
make
for
the
idea
of
those
who
speak
.
<EOS>
She
hear
it
all
under
embellishment
.
<EOS>
all
that
sound
extravagant
or
irrational
in
the
progress
of
the
reconciliation
may
have
no
origin
but
in
the
language
of
the
relator
.
<EOS>
still
,
however
,
she
have
the
sensation
of
there
be
something
more
than
immediately
appear
,
in
Mr
Elliot
's
wishing
,
after
an
interval
of
so
many
year
,
to
be
well
receive
by
them
.
<EOS>
in
a
worldly
view
,
he
have
nothing
to
gain
by
be
on
term
with
Sir
Walter
;
nothing
to
risk
by
a
state
of
variance
.
<EOS>
in
all
probability
he
be
already
the
rich
of
the
two
,
and
the
Kellynch
estate
would
as
surely
be
his
hereafter
as
the
title
.
<EOS>
a
sensible
man
,
and
he
have
look
like
a
very
sensible
man
,
why
should
it
be
an
object
to
him
?
<EOS>
She
could
only
offer
one
solution
;
it
be
,
perhaps
,
for
Elizabeth
's
sake
.
<EOS>
there
may
really
have
be
a
liking
formerly
,
though
convenience
and
accident
have
draw
him
a
different
way
;
and
now
that
he
could
afford
to
please
himself
,
he
may
mean
to
pay
his
address
to
her
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
certainly
very
handsome
,
with
well
-
breed
,
elegant
manner
,
and
her
character
may
never
have
be
penetrate
by
Mr
Elliot
,
know
her
but
in
public
,
and
when
very
young
himself
.
<EOS>
how
her
temper
and
understanding
may
bear
the
investigation
of
his
present
keen
time
of
life
be
another
concern
and
rather
a
fearful
one
.
<EOS>
most
earnestly
do
she
wish
that
he
may
not
be
too
nice
,
or
too
observant
if
Elizabeth
be
his
object
;
and
that
Elizabeth
be
dispose
to
believe
herself
so
,
and
that
her
friend
Mrs
Clay
be
encourage
the
idea
,
seem
apparent
by
a
glance
or
two
between
them
,
while
Mr
Elliot
's
frequent
visit
be
talk
of
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
mention
the
glimpse
she
have
have
of
him
at
Lyme
,

without
be
much
attend
to
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
perhaps
,
it
have
be
Mr
Elliot
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
him
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
They
could
not
listen
to
her
description
of
him
.
<EOS>
They
be
describe
him
themselves
;
Sir
Walter
especially
.
<EOS>
He
do
justice
to
his
very
gentlemanlike
appearance
,
his
air
of
elegance
and
fashion
,
his
good
shaped
face
,
his
sensible
eye
;
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
"
must
lament
his
be
very
much
under
-
hung
,
a
defect
which
time
seem
to
have
increase
;
nor
could
he
pretend
to
say
that
ten
year
have
not
alter
almost
every
feature
for
the
bad
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
appear
to
think
that
he
(
Sir
Walter
)
be
look
exactly
as
he
have
do
when
they
last
part
;
"
but
Sir
Walter
have
"
not
be
able
to
return
the
compliment
entirely
,
which
have
embarrass
him
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
mean
to
complain
,
however
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
be
well
to
look
at
than
most
man
,
and
he
have
no
objection
to
be
see
with
him
anywhere
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
,
and
his
friend
in
Marlborough
Buildings
,
be
talk
of
the
whole
evening
.
"
<EOS>
Colonel
Wallis
have
be
so
impatient
to
be
introduce
to
them
!
<EOS>
and
Mr
Elliot
so
anxious
that
he
should
!
"
<EOS>
and
there
be
a
Mrs
Wallis
,
at
present
know
only
to
them
by
description
,
as
she
be
in
daily
expectation
of
her
confinement
;
but
Mr
Elliot
speak
of
her
as
"
a
most
charming
woman
,
quite
worthy
of
be
know
in
Camden
Place
,
"
and
as
soon
as
she
recover
they
be
to
be
acquaint
.
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
think
much
of
Mrs
Wallis
;
she
be
say
to
be
an
excessively
pretty
woman
,
beautiful
.
"
<EOS>
He
long
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
He
hope
she
may
make
some
amend
for
the
many
very
plain
face
he
be
continually
pass
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
the
bad
of
Bath
be
the
number
of
its
plain
woman
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
mean
to
say
that
there
be
no
pretty
woman
,
but
the
number
of
the
plain
be
out
of
all
proportion
.
<EOS>
He
have
frequently
observe
,
as
he
walk
,
that
one
handsome
face
would
be
follow
by
thirty
,
or
five
-
and
-
thirty
fright
;
and
once
,
as
he
have
stand
in
a
shop
on
Bond
Street
,
he
have
count
<EOS>
eighty
-
seven
woman
go
by
,
one
after
another
,
without
there
be
a
tolerable
face
among
them
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
a
frosty
morning
,
to
be
sure
,
a
sharp
frost
,
which
hardly
one
woman
in
a
thousand
could
stand
the
test
of
.
<EOS>
but
still
,
there
certainly
be
a
dreadful
multitude
of
ugly
woman
in
Bath
;
and
as
for
the
man
!
<EOS>
they
be
infinitely
bad
.
<EOS>
such
scarecrow
as
the
street
be
full
of
!
<EOS>
It
be
evident
how
little
the
woman
be
use
to
the
sight
of
anything
tolerable
,
by
the
effect
which
a
man
of
decent
appearance
produce
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
walk
anywhere
arm
-
in
-
arm
with
Colonel
Wallis
(
who
be
a
fine
military
figure
,
though
sandy
-
haired
)
without
observe
that
every
woman
's
eye
be
upon
him
;
every
woman
's
eye
be
sure
to
be
upon
Colonel
Wallis
.
"
<EOS>
Modest
Sir
Walter
!
<EOS>
He
be
not
allow
to
escape
,
however
.
<EOS>
His
daughter
and
Mrs
Clay
unite
in
hint
that
Colonel
Wallis
's
companion
may
have
as
good
a
figure
as
Colonel
Wallis
,
and
certainly
be
not
sandy
-
haired
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
Mary
look
?
"
say
Sir
Walter
,
in
the
height
of
his
good
humour
.
<EOS>
"
the
last
time
I
see
her
she
have
a
red
nose
,
but
I
hope
that
may
not
happen
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
oh
!
no
,
that
must
have
be
quite
accidental
.
<EOS>
in
general
she
have
be
in
very
good
health
and
very
good
look
since
Michaelmas
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
think
it
would
not
tempt
her
to
go
out
in
sharp
wind
,
and
grow
coarse
,
I
would
send
her
a
new
hat
and
pelisse
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
be
consider
whether
she
should
venture
to
suggest
that
a
gown
,
or
a
cap
,
would
not
be
liable
to
any
such
misuse
,
when
a
knock
at
the
door
suspend
everything
.
"
<EOS>
a
knock
at
the
door
!
<EOS>
and
so
late
!
<EOS>
It
be
ten
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
Mr
Elliot
?
<EOS>
They
know
he
be
to
dine
in
Lansdown
Crescent
.
<EOS>
It
be
possible
that
he
may
stop
in
his
way
home
to
ask
them
how
they
do
.
<EOS>
They
could
think
of
no
one
else
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Clay
decidedly
think
it
Mr
Elliot
's
knock
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Clay
be
right
.
<EOS>
with
all
the
state
which
a
butler
and
foot
-
boy
could
give
,
Mr
Elliot
be
usher
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
same
,
the
very
same
man
,
with
no
difference
but
of
dress
.
<EOS>
Anne
draw
a
little
back
,
while
the
other
receive
his
compliment
,
and
her
sister
his
apology
for
call
at
so
unusual
an
hour
,
but
"
he
could
not
be
so
near
without
wish
to
know
that
neither
she
nor
her
friend
have
take
cold
the
day
before
,
"
&
c.
&
c
;
which
be
all
as
politely
do
,
and
as
politely
take
,
as
possible
,
but
her
part
must
follow
then
.
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
talk
of
his
young
daughter
;
"
Mr
Elliot
must
give
him
leave
to
present
him
to
his
young
daughter
"
<EOS>
(
there
be
no
occasion
for
remember
Mary
)
;
and
Anne
,
smile
and
blush
,
very
becomingly
shew
to
Mr
Elliot
the
pretty
feature
which
he
have
by
no
mean
forget
,
and
instantly
see
,
with
amusement
at
his
little
start
of
surprise
,
that
he
have
not
be
at
all
aware
of
who
she
be
.
<EOS>
He
look
completely
astonished
,
but
not
more
astonished
than
pleased
;
his
eye
brighten
!
<EOS>
and
with
the
most
perfect
alacrity
he
welcome
the
relationship
,
allude
to
the
past
,
and
entreat
to
be
receive
as
an
acquaintance
already
.
<EOS>
He
be
quite
as
good
-
look
as
he
have
appear
at
Lyme
,
his
countenance
improve
by
speak
,
and
his
manner
be
so
exactly
what
they
ought
to
be
,
so
polished
,
so
easy
,
so
particularly
agreeable
,
that
she
could
compare
them
in
excellence
to
only
one
person
's
manner
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
the
same
,
but
they
be
,
perhaps
,
equally
good
.
  
<EOS>
He
sit
down
with
them
,
and
improve
their
conversation
very
much
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
his
be
a
sensible
man
.
<EOS>
ten
minute
be
enough
to
certify
that
.
<EOS>
His
tone
,
his
expression
,
his
choice
of
subject
,
his
knowing
where
to
stop
;
it
be
all
the
operation
of
a
sensible
,
discerning
mind
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
could
,
he
begin
to
talk
to
her
of
Lyme
,
want
to
compare
opinion
respect
the
place
,
but
especially
want
to
speak
of
the
circumstance
of
their
happen
to
be
guest
in
the
same
inn
at
the
same
time
;
to
give
his
own
route
,
understand
something
of
hers
,
and
regret
that
he
should
have
lose
such
an
opportunity
of
pay
his
respect
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
give
him
a
short
account
of
her
party
and
business
at
Lyme
.
<EOS>
His
regret
increase
as
he
listen
.
<EOS>
He
have
spend
his
whole
solitary
evening
in
the
room
adjoin
theirs
;
have
hear
voice
,
mirth
continually
;
think
they
must
be
a
most
delightful
set
of
people
,
long
to
be
with
them
,
but
certainly
without
the
small
suspicion
of
his
possess
the
shadow
of
a
right
to
introduce
himself
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
but
ask
who
the
party
be
!
<EOS>
the
name
of
Musgrove
would
have
tell
him
enough
.
"
<EOS>
well
,
it
would
serve
to
cure
him
of
an
absurd
practice
of
never
ask
a
question
at
an
inn
,
which
he
have
adopt
,
when
quite
a
young
man
,
on
the
principal
of
its
be
very
ungenteel
to
be
curious
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
notion
of
a
young
man
of
one
or
two
and
twenty
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
as
to
what
be
necessary
in
manner
to
make
him
quite
the
thing
,
be
more
absurd
,
I
believe
,
than
those
of
any
other
set
of
being
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
the
folly
of
the
mean
they
often
employ
be
only
to
be
equal
by
the
folly
of
what
they
have
in
view
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
he
must
not
be
address
his
reflection
to
Anne
alone
<EOS>
:
he
know
it
;
he
be
soon
diffuse
again
among
the
other
,
and
it
be
only
at
interval
that
he
could
return
to
Lyme
.
  
<EOS>
His
enquiry
,
however
,
produce
at
length
an
account
of
the
scene
she
have
be
engage
in
there
,
soon
after
his
leave
the
place
.
<EOS>
have
allude
to
"
an
accident
,
"
he
must
hear
the
whole
.
<EOS>
when
he
question
,
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
begin
to
question
also
,
but
the
difference
in
their
manner
of
do
it
could
not
be
unfelt
.
<EOS>
She
could
only
compare
Mr
Elliot
to
Lady
Russell
,
in
the
wish
of
really
comprehend
what
have
pass
,
and
in
the
degree
of
concern
for
what
she
must
have
suffer
in
witness
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
staid
an
hour
with
them
.
<EOS>
the
elegant
little
clock
on
the
mantel
-
piece
have
strike
"
eleven
with
its
silver
sound
,
"
and
the
watchman
be
begin
to
be
hear
at
a
distance
tell
the
same
tale
,
before
Mr
Elliot
or
any
of
them
seem
to
feel
that
he
have
be
there
long
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
could
not
have
suppose
it
possible
that
her
first
evening
in
Camden
Place
could
have
pass
so
well
!
    
<EOS>
there
be
one
point
which
Anne
,
on
return
to
her
family
,
would
have
be
more
thankful
to
ascertain
even
than
Mr
Elliot
's
be
in
love
with
Elizabeth
,
which
be
,
her
father
be
not
be
in
love
with
Mrs
Clay
;
and
she
be
very
far
from
easy
about
it
,
when
she
have
be
at
home
a
few
hour
.
<EOS>
on
go
down
to
breakfast
the
next
morning
,
she
find
there
have
just
be
a
decent
pretence
on
the
lady
's
side
of
meaning
to
leave
them
.
<EOS>
She
could
imagine
Mrs
Clay
to
have
say
,
that
"
now
Miss
Anne
be
come
,
she
could
not
suppose
herself
at
all
want
;
"
for
Elizabeth
be
reply
in
a
sort
of
whisper
,
"
that
must
not
be
any
reason
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
I
feel
it
none
.
<EOS>
She
be
nothing
to
me
,
compare
with
you
;
"
and
she
be
in
full
time
to
hear
her
father
say
,
"
My
dear
madam
,
this
must
not
be
.
<EOS>
as
yet
,
you
have
see
nothing
of
Bath
.
<EOS>
You
have
be
here
only
to
be
useful
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
run
away
from
us
now
.
<EOS>
You
must
stay
to
be
acquaint
with
Mrs
Wallis
,
the
beautiful
Mrs
Wallis
.
<EOS>
to
your
fine
mind
,
I
well
know
the
sight
of
beauty
be
a
real
gratification
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
speak
and
look
so
much
in
earnest
,
that
Anne
be
not
surprised
to
see
Mrs
Clay
steal
a
glance
at
Elizabeth
and
herself
.
<EOS>
Her
countenance
,
perhaps
,
may
express
some
watchfulness
;
but
the
praise
of
the
fine
mind
do
not
appear
to
excite
a
thought
in
her
sister
.
<EOS>
the
lady
could
not
but
yield
to
such
joint
entreaty
,
and
promise
to
stay
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
the
same
morning
,
Anne
and
her
father
chancing
to
be
alone
together
,
he
begin
to
compliment
her
on
her
improved
look
;
he
think
her
"
less
thin
in
her
person
,
in
her
cheek
;
her
skin
,
her
complexion
,
greatly
improved
;
clear
,
fresher
.
<EOS>
have
she
be
use
any
thing
in
particular
?
"
<EOS>
"
no
,
nothing
.
"
<EOS>
"
merely
Gowland
,
"
he
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
nothing
at
all
.
"
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
he
be
surprised
at
that
;
"
and
add
,
"
certainly
you
can
not
do
better
than
to
continue
as
you
be
;
you
can
not
be
well
than
well
;
or
I
should
recommend
Gowland
,
the
constant
use
of
Gowland
,
during
the
spring
month
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Clay
have
be
use
it
at
my
recommendation
,
and
you
see
what
it
have
do
for
her
.
<EOS>
You
see
how
it
have
carry
away
her
freckle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
if
Elizabeth
could
but
have
hear
this
!
<EOS>
such
personal
praise
may
have
strike
her
,
especially
as
it
do
not
appear
to
Anne
that
the
freckle
be
at
all
lessen
.
<EOS>
but
everything
must
take
its
chance
.
<EOS>
the
evil
of
a
marriage
would
be
much
diminish
,
if
Elizabeth
be
also
to
marry
.
<EOS>
as
for
herself
,
she
may
always
command
a
home
with
Lady
Russell
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
's
composed
mind
and
polite
manner
be
put
to
some
trial
on
this
point
,
in
her
intercourse
in
Camden
Place
.
<EOS>
the
sight
of
Mrs
Clay
in
such
favour
,
and
of
Anne
so
overlooked
,
be
a
perpetual
provocation
to
her
there
;
and
vex
her
as
much
when
she
be
away
,
as
a
person
in
Bath
who
drink
the
water
,
get
all
the
new
publication
,
and
have
a
very
large
acquaintance
,
have
time
to
be
vex
.
  
<EOS>
as
Mr
Elliot
become
known
to
her
,
she
grow
more
charitable
,
or
more
indifferent
,
towards
the
other
.
<EOS>
His
manner
be
an
immediate
recommendation
;
and
on
converse
with
him
she
find
the
solid
so
fully
support
the
superficial
,
that
she
be
at
first
,
as
she
tell
Anne
,
almost
ready
to
exclaim
,
"
Can
this
be
Mr
Elliot
?
"
and
could
not
seriously
picture
to
herself
a
more
agreeable
or
estimable
man
.
<EOS>
everything
united
in
him
;
good
understanding
,
correct
opinion
,
knowledge
of
the
world
,
and
a
warm
heart
.
<EOS>
He
have
strong
feeling
of
family
attachment
and
family
honour
,
without
pride
or
weakness
;
he
live
with
the
liberality
of
a
man
of
fortune
,
without
display
;
he
judge
for
himself
in
everything
essential
,
without
defy
public
opinion
in
any
point
of
worldly
decorum
.
<EOS>
He
be
steady
,
observant
,
moderate
,
candid
;
never
run
away
with
by
spirit
or
by
selfishness
,
which
fancy
itself
strong
feeling
;
and
yet
,
with
a
sensibility
to
what
be
amiable
and
lovely
,
and
a
value
for
all
the
felicity
of
domestic
life
,
which
character
of
fancy
enthusiasm
and
violent
agitation
seldom
really
possess
.
<EOS>
She
be
sure
that
he
have
not
be
happy
in
marriage
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Wallis
say
it
,
and
Lady
Russell
see
it
;
but
it
have
be
no
unhappiness
to
sour
his
mind
,
nor
(
she
begin
pretty
soon
to
suspect
)
to
prevent
his
thinking
of
a
second
choice
.
<EOS>
Her
satisfaction
in
Mr
Elliot
outweigh
all
the
plague
of
Mrs
Clay
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
some
year
since
Anne
have
begin
to
learn
that
she
and
her
excellent
friend
could
sometimes
think
differently
;
and
it
do
not
surprise
her
,
therefore
,
that
Lady
Russell
should
see
nothing
suspicious
or
inconsistent
,
nothing
to
require
more
motive
than
appear
,
in
Mr
Elliot
's
great
desire
of
a
reconciliation
.
<EOS>
in
Lady
Russell
's
view
,
it
be
perfectly
natural
that
Mr
Elliot
,
at
a
mature
time
of
life
,
should
feel
it
a
most
desirable
object
,
and
what
would
very
generally
recommend
him
among
all
sensible
people
,
to
be
on
good
term
with
the
head
of
his
family
;
the
simple
process
in
the
world
of
time
upon
a
head
naturally
clear
,
and
only
err
in
the
heyday
of
youth
.
<EOS>
Anne
presume
,
however
,
still
to
smile
about
it
,
and
at
last
to
mention
"
Elizabeth
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
listen
,
and
look
,
and
make
only
this
cautious
reply
:
 
"
Elizabeth
!
<EOS>
very
well
;
time
will
explain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
reference
to
the
future
,
which
Anne
,
after
a
little
observation
,
feel
she
must
submit
to
.
<EOS>
She
could
determine
nothing
at
present
.
<EOS>
in
that
house
Elizabeth
must
be
first
;
and
she
be
in
the
habit
of
such
general
observance
as
"
Miss
Elliot
,
"
that
any
particularity
of
attention
seem
almost
impossible
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
,
too
,
it
must
be
remember
,
have
not
be
a
widower
seven
month
.
<EOS>
a
little
delay
on
his
side
may
be
very
excusable
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
Anne
could
never
see
the
crape
round
his
hat
,
without
fear
that
she
be
the
inexcusable
one
,
in
attribute
to
him
such
imagination
;
for
though
his
marriage
have
not
be
very
happy
,
still
it
have
exist
so
many
year
that
she
could
not
comprehend
a
very
rapid
recovery
from
the
awful
impression
of
its
be
dissolve
.
  
<EOS>
however
it
may
end
,
he
be
without
any
question
their
pleasantest
acquaintance
in
Bath
:
she
see
nobody
equal
to
him
;
and
it
be
a
great
indulgence
now
and
then
to
talk
to
him
about
Lyme
,
which
he
seem
to
have
as
lively
a
wish
to
see
again
,
and
to
see
more
of
,
as
herself
.
<EOS>
They
go
through
the
particular
of
their
first
meeting
a
great
many
time
.
<EOS>
He
give
her
to
understand
that
he
have
look
at
her
with
some
earnestness
.
<EOS>
She
know
it
well
;
and
she
remember
another
person
's
look
also
.
  
<EOS>
They
do
not
always
think
alike
.
<EOS>
His
value
for
rank
and
connexion
she
perceive
be
great
than
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
merely
complaisance
,
it
must
be
a
liking
to
the
cause
,
which
make
him
enter
warmly
into
her
father
and
sister
's
solicitude
on
a
subject
which
she
think
unworthy
to
excite
them
.
<EOS>
the
Bath
paper
one
morning
announce
the
arrival
of
the
Dowager
Viscountess
Dalrymple
,
and
her
daughter
,
the
Honourable
Miss
Carteret

and
all
the
comfort
of

Camden
Place

;
for
the
Dalrymples

in
Anne

opinion
,
most
unfortunately
)
be
cousin
of
the
Elliots
;
and
the
agony
be
how
to
introduce
themselves
properly
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
have
never
see
her
father
and
sister
before
in
contact
with
nobility
,
and
she
must
acknowledge
herself
disappoint
.
<EOS>
She
have
hope
well

from
their
high
idea
of
their
own
situation
in
life
,
and
be
reduce
to
form
a
wish
which
she
have
never
foresee
;
a
wish
that
they
have
more
pride
;

<EOS>
Sir
Walter
have
once
be
in
company
with
the
late
viscount
,
but
have
never
see
any
of
the
rest
of
the

the
difficulty
of
the
case
arise
from
there
have
be
a
suspension
of
all

by
letter
of
ceremony
,
<EOS>
ever
since
the
death
of

in

a
dangerous

of
Sir

there
have
be
an
unlucky

Ireland

<EOS>
the
neglect

for
when
poor
Lady
Elliot
die
herself
,
no
letter
of
condolence
be
receive
at
Kellynch
,
and
,
consequently
,
there
be
but
too
much
reason
to
apprehend
that
the
Dalrymples
consider
the
relationship
as
close

<EOS>
how
to
have
this
anxious
business
set
to
right
,
and
be
admit
as
cousin
again

be
the
question
:
and
it
be
a
question

in
a
more
rational
manner

neither

nor
Mr

think
unimportant
.
"
<EOS>
family

She
have
be
at
Bath
the
year
before
,
and
Lady
Russell
have
hear
her
speak
of
as
a
charming
woman
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
desirable
that
the
connexion
should
be
renew
,
if
it
could
be
do
,
without
any
compromise
of
propriety
on
the
side

"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
,
however

would
choose

at
last
write
a
very
fine
letter
of
ample
explanation
,
regret

entreaty

to
his

honourable

<EOS>
neither

it
do
all
that

<EOS>
Anne

have
Lady

very
agreeable

she
would

they
create

they
be
nothing

<EOS>
there
be
no

<EOS>
Lady

have
acquire
the
name

with
still

plain

<EOS>
so
awkward
,
that
she
would
never

be
tolerate
in
Camden

for
her
birth
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
confess
she
have
expect
something
well
;
but
yet
"
it
be
an
acquaintance
worth
have
;
"
and
when
Anne
venture
to
speak
her
opinion
of
them
to
Mr
Elliot
,
he
agree
to
their
be
nothing
in
themselves

but
still
maintain
that
,
as
a
family
connexion

as
good
company

would
collect
good
company
around

they
have

"
My

<EOS>
good

require
only
birth

education

manner

with
regard
to
education
be
not

birth

it
will
do
very
well

My

My

(

her

"
you
have
a
well
right
to
be
fastidious
than
almost
any
other
woman

will
it

<EOS>
Will
it
make

I

point

we

<EOS>
We
must
feel
that

among

may
be

He
look

as
he
speak
,
to
the
seat
which
Mrs

have

lately
occupy

a
sufficient
explanation
of
what
he
particularly
mean
;

though
Anne
could
not
believe
in
their
have
the
same
sort
of
pride
,
she
be
pleased
with
him
for
not
like
Mrs
Clay
;
and
her
conscience
admit
that
his
wishing
to
promote
her
father
's
get
great
acquaintance
be
more
than
excusable
in
the
view
of
defeat
her

<EOS>
while
Sir
Walter

Elizabeth
be
assiduously
push
their
good
fortune
in
Laura
Place
,
Anne
be
renew
an
acquaintance
of
a
very
different
description
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
call
on
her
former
governess
,
and
have
hear
from
her
of
there
be
an
old
school
-
fellow
in
Bath
,
who
have
the
two
strong
claim
on
her
attention
of
past
kindness
and
present
suffering
.
<EOS>
Miss
Hamilton
,
now
Mrs
Smith
,
have
shew
her
kindness
in
one
of
those
period
of
her
life
when
it
have
be
most
valuable
.
<EOS>
Anne
have
go
unhappy
to
school
,
grieve
for
the
loss
of
a
mother
whom
she
have
dearly
love
,
feel
her
separation
from
home
,
and
suffer
as
a
girl
of
fourteen
,
of
strong
sensibility
and
not
high
spirit
,
must
suffer
at
such
a
time
;
and
Miss
Hamilton
,
three
year
old
than
herself
,
but
still
from
the
want
of
near
relation
and
a
settle
home
,
remain
another
year
at
school
,
have
be
useful
and
good
to
her
in
a
way
which
have
considerably
lessen
her
misery
,
and
could
never
be
remember
with
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Hamilton
have
leave
school
,
have
marry
not
long
afterwards
,
be
say
to
have
marry
a
man
of
fortune
,
and
this
be
all
that
Anne
have
know
of
her
,
till
now
that
their
governess
's
account
bring
her
situation
forward
in
a
more
decided
but
very
different
form
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
a
widow
and
poor
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
have
be
extravagant
;
and
at
his
death
,
about
two
year
before
,
have
leave
his
affair
dreadfully
involve
.
<EOS>
She
have
have
difficulty
of
every
sort
to
contend
with
,
and
in
addition
to
these
distress
have
be
afflict
with
a
severe
rheumatic
fever
,
which
,
finally
settle
in
her
leg
,
have
make
her
for
the
present
a
cripple
.
<EOS>
She
have
come
to
Bath
on
that
account
,
and
be
now
in
lodging
near
the
hot
bath
,
live
in
a
very
humble
way
,
unable
even
to
afford
herself
the
comfort
of
a
servant
,
and
of
course
almost
exclude
from
society
.
  
<EOS>
Their
mutual
friend
answer
for
the
satisfaction
which
a
visit
from
Miss
Elliot
would
give
Mrs
Smith
,
and
Anne
therefore
lose
no
time
in
go
.
<EOS>
She
mention
nothing
of
what
she
have
hear
,
or
what
she
intend
,
at
home
.
<EOS>
It
would
excite
no
proper
interest
there
.
<EOS>
She
only
consult
Lady
Russell
,
who
enter
thoroughly
into
her

be
most
happy
to
convey
her
as
near
to
Mrs
Smith
's
lodging
in
Westgate
Buildings
,
as
Anne
choose
to
be
take
.
  
<EOS>
the
visit
be
pay
,
their
acquaintance
re
-
establish
,
their
interest
in
each
other
more
than
re
-
kindle
.
<EOS>
the
first
ten
minute
have
its
awkwardness
and
its
emotion
.
<EOS>
twelve
year
be
go
since
they
have
part
,
and
each
present
a
somewhat
different
person
from
what
the
other
have
imagine
.
<EOS>
twelve
year
have
change
Anne
from
the
blooming
,
silent
,
unformed
girl
of
fifteen
,
to
the
elegant
little
woman
of
seven
-
and
-
twenty
,
with
every
beauty
except
bloom
,
and
with
manner
as
consciously
right
as
they
be
invariably
gentle
;
and
twelve
year
have
transform
the
fine
-
look
,
well
-
grow
Miss
Hamilton
,
in
all
the
glow
of
health
and
confidence
of
superiority
,
into
a
poor
,
infirm
,
helpless
widow
,
receive
the
visit
of
her
former
protegee
as
a
favour
;
but
all
that
be
uncomfortable
in
the
meeting
have
soon
pass
away
,
and
leave
only
the
interesting
charm
of
remember
former
partiality
and
talk
over
old
time
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
find
in
Mrs
Smith
the
good
sense
and
agreeable
manner
which
she
have
almost
venture
to
depend
on
,
and
a
disposition
to
converse
and
be
cheerful
beyond
her
expectation
.
<EOS>
neither
the
dissipation
of
the
past
 
and
she
have
live
very
much
in
the
world
 
nor
the
restriction
of
the
present
,
neither
sickness
nor
sorrow
seem
to
have
close
her
heart
or
ruin
her
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
a
second
visit
she
talk
with
great
openness
,
and
Anne
's
astonishment
increase
.
<EOS>
She
could
scarcely
imagine
a
more
cheerless
situation
in
itself
than
Mrs
Smith
's
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
very
fond
of
her
husband
:
she
have
bury
him
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
use
to
affluence
:
it
be
go
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
child
to
connect
her
with
life
and
happiness
again
,
no
relation
to
assist
in
the
arrangement
of
perplex
affair
,
no
health
to
make
all
the
rest
supportable
.
<EOS>
Her
accommodation
be
limit
to
a
noisy
parlour
,
and
a
dark
bedroom
behind
,
with
no
possibility
of
move
from
one
to
the
other
without
assistance
,
which
there
be
only
one
servant
in
the
house
to
afford
,
and
she
never
quit
the
house
but
to
be
convey
into
the
warm
bath
.
<EOS>
yet
,
in
spite
of
all
this
,
Anne
have
reason
to
believe
that
she
have
moment
only
of
languor
and
depression
,
to
hour
of
occupation
and
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
how
could
it
be
?
<EOS>
She
watch
,
observe
,
reflect
,
and
finally
determine
that
this
be
not
a
case
of
fortitude
or
of
resignation
only
.
<EOS>
a
submissive
spirit
may
be
patient
,
a
strong
understanding
would
supply
resolution
,
but
here
be
something
more
;
here
be
that
elasticity
of
mind
,
that
disposition
to
be
comfort
,
that
power
of
turn
readily
from
evil
to
good
,
and
of
find
employment
which
carry
her
out
of
herself
,
which
be
from
nature
alone
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
choice
gift
of
Heaven
;
and
Anne
view
her
friend
as
one
of
those
instance
in
which
,
by
a
merciful
appointment
,
it
seem
design
to
counterbalance
almost
every
other
want
.
  
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
time
,
Mrs
Smith
tell
her
,
when
her
spirit
have
nearly
fail
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
call
herself
an
invalid
now
,
compare
with
her
state
on
first
reach
Bath
.
<EOS>
then
she
have
,
indeed
,
be
a
pitiable
object
;
for
she
have
catch
cold
on
the
journey
,
and
have
hardly
take
possession
of
her
lodging
before
she
be
again
confine
to
her
bed
and
suffer
under
severe
and
constant
pain
;
and
all
this
among
stranger
,
with
the
absolute
necessity
of
have
a
regular
nurse
,
and
finance
at
that
moment
particularly
unfit
to
meet
any
extraordinary
expense
.
<EOS>
She
have
weather
it
,
however
,
and
could
truly
say
that
it
have
do
her
good
.
<EOS>
It
have
increase
her
comfort
by
make
her
feel
herself
to
be
in
good
hand
.
<EOS>
She
have
see
too
much
of
the
world
,
to
expect
sudden
or
disintereste
attachment
anywhere
,
but
her
illness
have
prove
to
her
that
her
landlady
have
a
character
to
preserve
,
and
would
not
use
her
ill
;
and
she
have
be
particularly
fortunate
in
her
nurse
,
as
a
sister
of
her
landlady
,
a
nurse
by
profession
,
and
who
have
always
a
home
in
that
house
when
unemployed
,
chance
to
be
at
liberty
just
in
time
to
attend
her
.
"
<EOS>
and
she
,
"
say
Mrs
Smith
,
"
besides
nurse
me
most
admirably
,
have
really
prove
an
invaluable
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
could
use
my
hand
she
teach
me
to
knit
,
which
have
be
a
great
amusement
;
and
she
put
me
in
the
way
of
make
these
little
thread
-
case
,
pin
-
cushion
and
card
-
rack
,
which
you
always
find
me
so
busy
about
,
and
which
supply
me
with
the
mean
of
do
a
little
good
to
one
or
two
very
poor
family
in
this
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
large
acquaintance
,
of
course
professionally
,
among
those
who
can
afford
to
buy
,
and
she
dispose
of
my
merchandise
.
<EOS>
She
always
take
the
right
time
for
apply
.
<EOS>
everybody
's
heart
be
open
,
you
know
,
when
they
have
recently
escape
from
severe
pain
,
or
be
recover
the
blessing
of
health
,
and
Nurse
Rooke
thoroughly
understand
when
to
speak
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
shrewd
,
intelligent
,
sensible
woman
.
<EOS>
Hers
be
a
line
for
see
human
nature
;
and
she
have
a
fund
of
good
sense
and
observation
,
which
,
as
a
companion
,
make
her
infinitely
superior
to
thousand
of
those
who
have
only
receive
"
the
good
education
in
the
world
,
"
know
nothing
worth
attend
to
.
<EOS>
call
it
gossip
,
if
you
will
,
but
when
Nurse
Rooke
have
half
an
hour
's
leisure
to
bestow
on
me
,
she
be
sure
to
have
something
to
relate
that
be
entertaining
and
profitable
:
something
that
make
one
know
one
's
specie
better
.
<EOS>
one
like
to
hear
what
be
go
on
,
to
be
au
fait
as
to
the
new
mode
of
be
trifling
and
silly
.
<EOS>
to
me
,
who
live
so
much
alone
,
her
conversation
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
be
a
treat
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
,
far
from
wish
to
cavil
at
the
pleasure
,
reply
,
"
I
can
easily
believe
it
.
<EOS>
woman
of
that
class
have
great
opportunity
,
and
if
they
be
intelligent
may
be
well
worth
listen
to
.
<EOS>
such
variety
of
human
nature
as
they
be
in
the
habit
of
witness
!
<EOS>
and
it
be
not
merely
in
its
folly
,
that
they
be
well
read
;
for
they
see
it
occasionally
under
every
circumstance
that
can
be
most
interesting
or
affect
.
<EOS>
what
instance
must
pass
before
them
of
ardent
,
disintereste
,
self
-
deny
attachment
,
of
heroism
,
fortitude

patience

resignation

of
all
the
conflict

all
the
sacrifice
that
ennoble
us
most

a
sick
chamber
may
often
furnish
the
worth
of
volume

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Mrs
Smith
more
doubtingly
,
"
<EOS>
sometimes
it
may
,
though
I
fear
its
lesson
be
not
often
in
the
elevated
style
you
describe
.
<EOS>
here
and
there
,
human
nature
may
be
great
in
time
of
trial
;
but
generally
speak
,
it
be
its
weakness
and
not
its
strength
that
appear
in
a
sick
chamber
:
<EOS>
it
be
selfishness
and
impatience
rather
than
generosity
and
fortitude
,
that
one
hear
of
.
<EOS>
there
be
so
little
real
friendship
in
the
world
!
<EOS>
and
unfortunately
"
(
speak
low
and
tremulously
)
"
there
be
so
many
who
forget
to
think
seriously
till
it
be
almost
too
late
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
see
the
misery
of
such
feeling
.
<EOS>
the
husband
have
not
be
what
he
ought
,
and
the
wife
have
be
lead
among
that
part
of
mankind
which
make
her
think
bad
of
the
world
than
she
hope
it
deserve
.
<EOS>
It
be
but
a
pass
emotion
however
with
Mrs
Smith
;
she
shake
it
off
,
and
soon
add
in
a
different
tone
    
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
suppose
the
situation
my
friend
Mrs
Rooke
be
in
at
present
,
will
furnish
much
either
to
interest
or
edify
me
.
<EOS>
She
be
only
nursing
Mrs
Wallis
of
Marlborough
Buildings
;
a
mere
pretty
,
silly
,
expensive
,
fashionable
woman
,
I
believe
;
and
of
course
will
have
nothing
to
report
but
of
lace
and
finery
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
make
my
profit
of
Mrs
Wallis

however

She

plenty
of
money

on

at

still
there
be
question
enough
ask

severe

one

what

that

upon

surely
you
may
put
off
this

morrow

not

long

a
little
in
defence

She
make
no

She
leave
it
to
himself
to

Anne
keep
her
appointment
;
the
other
keep
theirs

of
course
she
hear
the
next
morning
that
they
have
have
a
delightful
evening
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
the
only
one
of

set
absent

for
Sir
Walter

Elizabeth
have
not
only
be
quite
at

have
actually
be
happy
to

employ

her
in
collect

have
be
at
the
trouble
of
invite
both

have
make

the
whole

to
her

its
great
interest
must
be

be
very
much
talk

be
wish
for

regret

at
the

honour

Her
kind

compassionate
visit
to
this
old
schoolfellow

sick

reduced

seem
to
have
quite
delighted
Mr

think
her
a
most
extraordinary
young
woman

in
her
temper

mind
,
a
model
of
female
excellence

He
could
meet
even
Lady

discussion

merit

Anne
could
not

give

highly

calculate
the

week
which
would

him
from
all
the

restraint
of
widowhood

leave
him
at
liberty
to
exert
his
most
open
power

<EOS>
She
would
not
speak
to
Anne
with
half
the
certainty
she
feel
on
the
subject
,
she
would
venture
on
little
more
than
hint
of
what
may
be
hereafter
,
of
a
possible
attachment
on
his
side

of
the

of
the

such
attachment

Anne

no

exclamation

gently

her

I

you

You

only
superior

<EOS>
My
dearest
Anne
,
it
would
give
me
more
delight
than
be
often
feel
at
my
time
of
life

<EOS>
Anne
be
oblige
to
turn
away
,
to
rise
,
to
walk
to
a
distant
table
,
and
,
lean
there
in
pretended
employment
,
try
to
subdue
the
feeling
this
picture
excited
.
<EOS>
for
a
few
moment
her
imagination

her
heart
be
bewitch

<EOS>
the
idea

become
what
her
mother
have
be
;
of
have
the
precious
name
of
"
Lady
Elliot
"
first
revive
in
herself
;
of
be
restore
to
Kellynch
,
call
it
her
home
again
,
her
home
for
ever
,
be
a
charm
which
she
could
not
immediately
resist
.
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
say
not
another
word
,
willing
to
leave
the
matter
to
its
own
operation
;
and
believe
that
,
could
Mr
Elliot
at
that
moment
with
propriety
have
speak
for
himself
!
 
<EOS>
she
believe
,
in
short
,
what
Anne
do
not
believe
.
<EOS>
the
same
image
of
Mr
Elliot
speak
for
himself
bring
Anne
to
composure
again
.
<EOS>
the
charm
of
Kellynch
and
of
"
Lady
Elliot
"
all
fade
away
.
<EOS>
She
never
could
accept
him
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
not
only
that
her
feeling
be
still
adverse
to
any
man
save
one
;
her
judgement
,
on
a
serious
consideration
of
the
possibility
of
such
a
case
be
against
Mr
Elliot
.
  
<EOS>
though
they
have
now
be
acquaint
a
month
,
she
could
not
be
satisfied
that
she
really
know
his
character
.
<EOS>
that
he
be
a
sensible
man
,
an
agreeable
man
,
that
he
talk
well
,
profess
good
opinion
,
seem
to
judge
properly
and
as
a
man
of
principle
,
this
be
all
clear
enough
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
know
what
be
right
,
nor
could
she
fix
on
any
one
article
of
moral
duty
evidently
transgress
;
but
yet
she
would
have
be
afraid
to
answer
for
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
She
distrust
the
past
,
if
not
the
present
.
<EOS>
the
name
which
occasionally
dropt
of
former
associate
,
the
allusion
to
former
practice
and
pursuit
,
suggest
suspicion
not
favourable
of
what
he
have
be
.
<EOS>
She
see
that
there
have
be
bad
habit
;
that
Sunday
travel
have
be
a
common
thing
;
that
there
have
be
a
period
of
his
life
(
and
probably
not
a
short
one
)
<EOS>
when
he
have
be
,
at
least
,
careless
in
all
serious
matter
;
and
,
though
he
may
now
think
very
differently
,
who
could
answer
for
the
true
sentiment
of
a
clever
,
cautious
man
,
grow
old
enough
to
appreciate
a
fair
character
?
<EOS>
how
could
it
ever
be
ascertain
that
his
mind
be
truly
cleanse
?
  
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
be
rational
,
discreet
,
polish
,
but
he
be
not
open
.
<EOS>
there
be
never
any
burst
of
feeling
,
any
warmth
of
indignation
or
delight
,
at
the
evil
or
good
of
other
.
<EOS>
this
,
to
Anne
,
be
a
decide
imperfection
.
<EOS>
Her
early
impression
be
incurable
.
<EOS>
She
prize
the
frank
,
the
open
-
hearted
,
the
eager
character
beyond
all
other
.
<EOS>
warmth
and
enthusiasm
do
captivate
her
still
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
she
could
so
much
more
depend
upon
the
sincerity
of
those
who
sometimes
look
or
say
a
careless
or
a
hasty
thing
,
than
of
those
whose
presence
of
mind
never
varied
,
whose
tongue
never
slip
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
be
too
generally
agreeable
.
<EOS>
various
as
be
the
temper
in
her
father
's
house
,
he
please
them
all
.
<EOS>
He
endure
too
well
,
stand
too
well
with
every
body
.
<EOS>
He
have
speak
to
her
with
some
degree
of
openness
of
Mrs
Clay
;
have
appear
completely
to
see
what
Mrs
Clay
be
about
,
and
to
hold
her
in
contempt
;
and
yet
Mrs
Clay
find
him
as
agreeable
as
any
body
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
see
either
less
or
more
than
her
young
friend
,
for
she
see
nothing
to
excite
distrust
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
imagine
a
man
more
exactly
what
he
ought
to
be
than
Mr
Elliot
;
nor
do
she
ever
enjoy
a
sweet
feeling
than
the
hope
of
see
him
receive
the
hand
of
her
beloved
Anne
in
Kellynch
church
,
in
the
course
of
the
follow
autumn

<EOS>
It
be
the

of
February

and
Anne

have
be
a
month
in
Bath

very
eager
for
news
from
Uppercross
and
Lyme

<EOS>
She
want
to
hear
much
more
than
Mary

communicate
.
<EOS>
It
be
three
week
since
she
have
hear
at
all

<EOS>
She
only
know
that
Henrietta
be
at
home
again
;
and
that
Louisa
,
though
consider
to
be
recover
fast
,
be
still
in
Lyme
;
and
she
be
think
of
them
all
very
intently
one
evening
,
<EOS>
when
a
thick
letter

usual
from
Mary

deliver
to
her

,
to
quicken
the
pleasure

with
Admiral

compliment

<EOS>
the
Crofts
must
be
in
Bath

a
circumstance

They

oh
!

those

They

introduction

I
should
have
visit
Admiral
Croft

however

at
any
rate

<EOS>
I
know
what
be
due
to
my
tenant

<EOS>

<EOS>
Anne
could
listen
no
longer
;
she
could
not
even
have
tell
how
the
poor
Admiral
's
complexion
escape
;
her
letter
engross
her
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
begin
several
day
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
February
1st
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Anne
,
 
I
make
no
apology
for
my
silence
,
because
I
know
how
little
people
think
of
letter
in
such
a
place
as
Bath
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
a
great
deal
too
happy
to
care
for
Uppercross
,
<EOS>
which
,
as
you
well
know
,
afford
little
to
write
about
.
<EOS>
We
have
have
a
very
dull
Christmas
;
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
have
not
have
one
dinner
party
all
the
holiday
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
reckon
the
Hayters
as
anybody
.
<EOS>
the
holiday
,
however
,
be
over
at
last
:
I
believe
no
child
ever
have
such
long
one
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
have
not
.
<EOS>
the
house
be
clear
yesterday
,
except
of
the
little
Harvilles
;
but
you
will
be
surprised
to
hear
they
have
never
go
home
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Harville
must
be
an
odd
mother
to
part
with
them
so
long
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
it
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
at
all
nice
child
,
in
my
opinion
;
but
Mrs
Musgrove
seem
to
like
them
quite
as
well
,
if
not
well
,
than
her
grandchild
.
<EOS>
what
dreadful
weather
we
have
have
!
<EOS>
It
may
not
be
feel
in
Bath
,
with
your
nice
pavement
;
but
in
the
country
it
be
of
some
consequence
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
have
a
creature
call
on
me
since
the
second
week
in
January
,
except
Charles
Hayter
,
who
have
be
call
much
oftener
than
be
welcome
.
<EOS>
between
ourselves
,
I
think
it
a
great
pity
<EOS>
Henrietta
do
not
remain
at
Lyme
as
long
as
Louisa
;
it
would
have
keep
her
a
little
out
of
his
way
.
<EOS>
the
carriage
be
go
to
-
day
,
to
bring
Louisa
and
the
Harvilles
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
We
be
not
ask
to
dine
with
them
,
however
,
till
the
day
after
,
Mrs
Musgrove
be
so
afraid
of
her
be
fatigue
by
the
journey
,
which
be
not
very
likely
,
consider
the
care
that
will
be
take
of
her
;
and
it
would
be
much
more
convenient
to
me
to
dine
there
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
be
glad
you
find
Mr
Elliot
so
agreeable
,
and
wish
I
could
be
acquaint
with
him
too
;
but
I
have
my
usual
luck
:
I
be
always
out
of
the
way
when
any
thing
desirable
be
go
on
;
always
the
last
of
my
family
to
be
notice
.
<EOS>
what
an
immense
time
Mrs
Clay
have
be
stay
with
Elizabeth
!
<EOS>
do
she
never
mean
to
go
away
?
<EOS>
but
perhaps
if
she
be
to
leave
the
room
vacant
,
we
may
not
be
invite
.
<EOS>
let
me
know
what
you
think
of
this
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
expect
my
child
to
be
ask
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
can
leave
them
at
the
Great
House
very
well
,
for
a
month
or
six
week
.
<EOS>
I
have
this
moment
hear
that
the
Crofts
be
go
to
Bath
almost
immediately
;
they
think
the
Admiral
gouty
.
<EOS>
Charles
hear
it
quite
by
chance
;
they
have
not
have
the
civility
to
give
me
any
notice
,
or
of
offer
to
take
anything
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
they
improve
at
all
as
neighbour
.
<EOS>
We
see
nothing
of
them
,
and
this
be
really
an
instance
of
gross
inattention
.
<EOS>
Charles
join
me
in
love
,
and
everything
proper
.
<EOS>
yours
affectionately
,
  
"
Mary
M

<EOS>

I
be
sorry
to
say
that
I
be
very
far
from
well
;
and
Jemima
have
just
tell
me
that
the
butcher
say
there
be
a
bad
sore
-
throat
very
much
about
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
I
shall
catch
it
;
and
my
sore
-
throat
,
you
know
,
be
always
bad
than
anybody
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
end
the
first
part
,
which
have
be
afterwards
put
into
an
envelope
,
contain
nearly
as
much
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
keep
my
letter
open
,
that
I
may
send
you
word
how
Louisa
bear
her
journey
,
and
now
I
be
extremely
glad
I
do
,
have
a
great
deal
to
add
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
I
have
a
note
from
Mrs
Croft
yesterday
,
offer
to
convey
anything
to
you
;
a
very
kind
,
friendly
note
indeed
,
address
to
me
,
just
as
it
ought
;
I
shall
therefore
be
able
to
make
my
letter
as
long
as
I
like
.
<EOS>
the
Admiral
do
not
seem
very
ill
,
and
I
sincerely
hope
Bath
will
do
him
all
the
good
he
want
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
truly
glad
to
have
them
back
again
.
<EOS>
Our
neighbourhood
can
not
spare
such
a
pleasant
family
.
<EOS>
but
now
for
Louisa
.
<EOS>
I
have
something
to
communicate
that
will
astonish
you
not
a
little
.
<EOS>
She
and
the
Harvilles
come
on
Tuesday
very
safely
,
and
in
the
evening
we
go
to
ask
her
how
she
do
,
when
we
be
rather
surprised
not
to
find
Captain
Benwick
of
the
party
,
for
he
have
be
invite
as
well
as
the
Harvilles
;
and
what
do
you
think
be
the
reason
?
<EOS>
neither
more
nor
less
than
his
being
in
love
with
Louisa
,
and
not
choose
to
venture
to
Uppercross
till
he
have
have
an
answer
from
Mr
Musgrove
;
for
it
be
all
settle
between
him
and
her
before
she
come
away
,
and
he
have
write
to
her
father
by
Captain
Harville
.
<EOS>
true
,
upon
my
honour
!
<EOS>
be
not
you
astonished
?
<EOS>
I
shall
be
surprised
at
least
if
you
ever
receive
a
hint
of
it
,
for
I
never
do
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Musgrove
protest
solemnly
that
she
know
nothing
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
We
be
all
very
well
pleased
,
however
,
for
though
it
be
not
equal
to
her
marry
Captain
Wentworth
<EOS>
,
it
be
infinitely
well
than
Charles
Hayter
;
and
Mr
Musgrove
have
write
his
consent
,
and
Captain
Benwick
be
expect
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Harville
say
her
husband
feel
a
good
deal
on
his
poor
sister
's
account
;
but
,
however
,
Louisa
be
a
great
favourite
with
both
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
Mrs
Harville
and
I
quite
agree
that
we
love
her
the
well
for
have
nurse
her
.
<EOS>
Charles
wonder
what
Captain
Wentworth
will
say
;
but
if
you
remember
,
I
never
think
him
attach
to
Louisa
;
I
never
could
see
anything
of
it
.
<EOS>
and
this
be
the
end
,
you
see
,
of
Captain
Benwick
's
be
suppose
to
be
an
admirer
of
yours
.
<EOS>
how
Charles
could
take
such
a
thing
into
his
head
be
always
incomprehensible
to
me

<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
be
more
agreeable
now
.
<EOS>
certainly
not
a
great
match
for
Louisa
Musgrove
,
but
a
million
time
well
than
marry
among
the
Hayters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
nee
not
have
fear
her
sister
's
be
in
any
degree
prepare
for
the
news
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
in
her
life
be
more
astonished
.
<EOS>
Captain
Benwick
and
Louisa
Musgrove
!
<EOS>
It
be
almost
too
wonderful
for
belief
,
and
it
be
with
the
great
effort
that
she
could
remain
in
the
room
,
preserve
an
air
of
calmness
,
and
answer
the
common
question
of
the
moment
.
<EOS>
happily
for
her
,
they
be
not
many
.
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
want
to
know
whether
the
Crofts
travel
with
four
horse
,
and
whether
they
be
likely
to
be
situate
in
such
a
part
of
Bath
as
it
may
suit
Miss
Elliot
and
himself
to
visit
in
;
but
have
little
curiosity
beyond
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
Mary
?
"
say
Elizabeth
;
and
without
wait
for
an
answer
,
"
and
pray
what
bring
the
Crofts
to
Bath
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
come
on
the
Admiral
's
account
.
<EOS>
He
be
think
to
be
gouty
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
gout
and
decrepitude
!
<EOS>
"
say
Sir
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
poor
old
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
they
any
acquaintance
here
?
"
ask
Elizabeth
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
;
but
I
can
hardly
suppose
that
,
at
Admiral
Croft
's
time
of
life
,
and
in
his
profession
,
he
should
not
have
many
acquaintance
in
such
a
place
as
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
,
"
say
Sir
Walter
coolly
,
"
that
Admiral
Croft
will
be
best
know
in
Bath
as
the
renter
of
Kellynch
Hall
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
,
may
we
venture
to
present
him
and
his
wife
in
Laura
Place
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
situate
as
we
be
with
Lady
Dalrymple
,
cousin
,
we
ought
to
be
very
careful
not
to
embarrass
her
with
acquaintance
she
may
not
approve
.
<EOS>
if
we
be
not
relate
,
it
would
not
signify
;
but
as
cousin
,
she
would
feel
scrupulous
as
to
any
proposal
of
ours
.
<EOS>
We
have
better
leave
the
Crofts
to
find
their
own
level
.
<EOS>
there
be
several
odd
-
look
man
walk
about
here
,
who
,
I
be
tell
,
be
sailor
.
<EOS>
the
Crofts
will
associate
with
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
's
share
of
interest
in
the
letter
;
when
Mrs
Clay
have
pay
her
tribute
of
more
decent
attention
,
in
an
enquiry
after
Mrs
Charles
Musgrove
,
and
her
fine
little
boy
,
Anne
be
at
liberty
.
  
<EOS>
in
her
own
room
,
she
try
to
comprehend
it
.
<EOS>
well
may
Charles
wonder
how
Captain
Wentworth
would
feel
!
<EOS>
perhaps
he
have
quit
the
field
,
have
give
Louisa
up
,
have
cease
to
love
,
have
find
he
do
not
love
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
endure
the
idea
of
treachery
or
levity
,
or
anything
akin
to
ill
usage
between
him
and
his
friend
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
endure
that
such
a
friendship
as
theirs
should
be
sever
unfairly
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Benwick
and
Louisa
Musgrove
!
<EOS>
the
high
-
spirited
,
joyous
-
talk
Louisa
Musgrove
,
and
the
dejected
,
think
,
feeling
,
reading
,
Captain
Benwick
,
seem
each
of
them
everything
that
would
not
suit
the
other
.
<EOS>
Their
mind
most
dissimilar
!
<EOS>
where
could
have
be
the
attraction
?
<EOS>
the
answer
soon
present
itself
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
in
situation
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
throw
together
several
week
;
they
have
be
live
in
the
same
small
family
party
:
since
Henrietta
's
come
away
,
they
must
have
be
depend
almost
entirely
on
each
other
,
and
Louisa
,
just
recover
from
illness
,
have
be
in
an
interesting
state
,
and
Captain
Benwick
be
not
inconsolable
.
<EOS>
that
be
a
point
which
Anne
have
not
be
able
to
avoid
suspect
before
;
and
instead
of
draw
the
same
conclusion
as
Mary
,
from
the
present
course
of
event
,
they
serve
only
to
confirm
the
idea
of
his
have
feel
some
dawning
of
tenderness
toward
herself
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
mean
,
however
,
to
derive
much
more
from
it
to
gratify
her
vanity
,
than
Mary
may
have
allow
.
<EOS>
She
be
persuade
that
any
tolerably
pleasing
young
woman
who
have
listen
and
seem
to
feel
for
him
would
have
receive
the
same
compliment
.
<EOS>
He
have
an
affectionate
heart
.
<EOS>
He
must
love
somebody
.
  
<EOS>
She
see
no
reason
against
their
be
happy
.
<EOS>
Louisa
have
fine
naval
fervour
to
begin
with
,
and
they
would
soon
grow
more
alike
.
<EOS>
He
would
gain
cheerfulness
,
and
she
would
learn
to
be
an
enthusiast
for
Scott
and
Lord
Byron
;
nay
,
that
be
probably
learn
already
;
of
course
they
have
fall
in
love
over
poetry
.
<EOS>
the
idea
of
Louisa
Musgrove
turn
into
a
person
of
literary
taste
,
and
sentimental
reflection
be
amusing
,
but
she
have
no
doubt
of
its
being
so
.
<EOS>
the
day
at
Lyme
,
the
fall
from
the
Cobb
,
may
influence
her
health
,
her
nerve
,
her
courage
,
her
character
to
the
end
of
her
life
,
as
thoroughly
as
it
appear
to
have
influence
her
fate
.
  
<EOS>
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
be
,
that
if
the
woman
who
have
be
sensible
of
Captain
Wentworth
's
merit
could
be
allow
to
prefer
another
man
,
there
be
nothing
in
the
engagement
to
excite
last
wonder
;
and
if
Captain
Wentworth
lose
no
friend
by
it
,
certainly
nothing
to
be
regret
.
<EOS>
no
,
it
be
not
regret
which
make
Anne
's
heart
beat
in
spite
of
herself
,
and
bring
the
colour
into
her
cheek
when
she
think
of
Captain
Wentworth
unshackled
and
free
.
<EOS>
She
have
some
feeling
which
she
be
ashamed
to
investigate
.
<EOS>
They
be
too
much
like
joy
,
senseless
joy
!
  
<EOS>
She
long
to
see
the
Crofts
;
but
when
the
meeting
take
place
,
it
be
evident
that
no
rumour
of
the
news
have
yet
reach
them
.
<EOS>
the
visit
of
ceremony
be
pay
and
return
;
and
Louisa
Musgrove
be
mention
,
and
Captain
Benwick
,
too
,
without
even
half
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
the
Crofts
have
place
themselves
in
lodging
in
Gay
Street
,
perfectly
to
Sir
Walter
's
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
at
all
ashamed
of
the
acquaintance
,
and
do
,
in
fact
,
think
and
talk
a
great
deal
more
about
the
Admiral
,
than
the
Admiral
ever
think
or
talk
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
Crofts
know
quite
as
many
people
in
Bath
as
they
wish
for
,
and
consider
their
intercourse
with
the
Elliots
as
a
mere
matter
of
form
,
and
not
in
the
least
likely
to
afford
them
any
pleasure
.
<EOS>
They
bring
with
them
their
country
habit
of
be
almost
always
together
.
<EOS>
He
be
order
to
walk
to
keep
off
the
gout
,
and
Mrs
Croft
seem
to
go
share
with
him
in
everything
,
and
to
walk
for
her
life
to
do
him
good
.
<EOS>
Anne
see
them
wherever
she
go
.
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
take
her
out
in
her
carriage
almost
every
morning
,
and
she
never
fail
to
think
of
them
,
and
never
fail
to
see
them
.
<EOS>
know
their
feeling
as
she
do
,
it
be
a
most
attractive
picture
of
happiness
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
always
watch
them
as
long
as
she
could
,
delight
to
fancy
<EOS>
she
understand
what
they
may
be
talk
of
,
as
they
walk
along
in
happy
independence
,
or
equally
delighted
to
see
the
Admiral
's
hearty
shake
of
the
hand
when
he
encounter
an
old
friend
,
and
observe
their
eagerness
of
conversation
when
occasionally
form
into
a
little
knot
of
the
navy
,
Mrs
Croft
look
as
intelligent
and
keen
as
any
of
the
officer
around
her
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
be
too
much
engage
with
Lady
Russell
to
be
often
walk
herself
;
but
it
so
happen
that
one
morning
,
about
a
week
or
ten
day
after
the
Croft
's
arrival
,
it
suit
her
good
to
leave
her
friend
,
or
her
friend
's
carriage
,
in
the
low
part
of
the
town
,
and
return
alone
to
Camden
Place
,
and
in
walk
up
Milsom
Street
she
have
the
good
fortune
to
meet
with
the
Admiral
.
<EOS>
He
be
stand
by
himself
at
a
printshop
window
,
with
his
hand
behind
him
,
in
earnest
contemplation
of
some
print
,
and
she
not
only
may
have
pass
him
unseen
,
but
be
oblige
to
touch
as
well
as
address
him
before
she
could
catch
his
notice
.
<EOS>
when
he
do
perceive
and
acknowledge
her
,
however
,
it
be
do
with
all
his
usual
frankness
and
good
humour
.

here

about

upset
the
next
moment

they

laugh
heartily

I
would
not

take
a

look
at
the

begin
to
be
in

She

<EOS>
It

us
very
well

<EOS>
We
be
always
meet
with
some
old
friend
or
other
;
the
street
full
of
them
every
morning
;
sure
to
have
plenty
of
chat
;
and
then
we
get
away
from
them
all
,
and
shut
ourselves
in
our
lodging
,
and
draw
in
our
chair
,
and
be
snug
as
if
we
be
at
Kellynch
,
ay
,
or
as
we
use
to
be
even
at
North
Yarmouth
and
Deal

We
do
not
like
our
lodging
here
the
bad

I
can

when
they
be
get
a
little
farther
,
Anne
venture
to
press
again
for
what
he
have
to
communicate
.
<EOS>
She
hope
when
clear
of
Milsom
Street
to
have
her
curiosity
gratify
;
but
she
be
still
oblige
to
wait
,
for
the
Admiral
have
make
up
his
mind
not
to
begin
till
they
have
gain
the
great
space
and
quiet
of
Belmont
;

as
she
be
not
really
Mrs
Croft
,
she
must
let
him
have
his
own
way

soon

well

her
christian
name

"
  
<EOS>
Anne
have
be
ashamed
to
appear
to
comprehend
so
soon
as
she
really
do
;
but
now
she
could
safely
suggest
the
name
of
"
Louisa

<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
,
Miss
Louisa
Musgrove

that
be
the
name

I
wish
young
lady
have
not
such
a
number
of
fine
christian
name

I
should
never
be
out
if
they
be
all
sophys

this
Miss

wonder
be
,
what
they
could
be
wait
for
,
till
the
business
at
Lyme
come
;
then
,
indeed
,
it
be
clear
enough
that
they
must
wait
till
her
brain
be
set
to
right
.
<EOS>
but
even
then
there
be
something
odd
in
their
way
of
go
on
.
<EOS>
instead
of
stay
at
Lyme
,
he
go
off
to
Plymouth
,
and
then
he
go
off
to
see
Edward
.
<EOS>
when
we
come
back
from
Minehead
<EOS>
he
be
go
down
to
Edward
's
,
and
there
he
have
be
ever
since
.
<EOS>
We
have
see
nothing
of
him
since
November
.
<EOS>
even
Sophy
could
not
understand
it
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
the
matter
have
take
the
strange
turn
of
all
;
for
this
young
lady
,
the
same
Miss
Musgrove
,
instead
of
be
to
marry
Frederick
,
be
to
marry
James
Benwick
.
<EOS>
You
know
James
Benwick
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
a
little
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
little
acquaint
with
Captain
Benwick
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
she
be
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
nay
,
most
likely
they
be
married
already
,
for
I
do
not
know
what
they
should
wait
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
Captain
Benwick
a
very
pleasing
young
man
,
"
say
Anne
,
"
and
I
understand
that
he
bear
an
excellent
character
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
there
be
not
a
word
to
be
say
against
James
Benwick
.
<EOS>
He
be
only
a
commander
,
it
be
true
,
make
last
summer
,
and
these
be
bad
time
for
get
on
,
but
he
have
not
another
fault
that
I
know
of
.
<EOS>
an
excellent
,
good
-
hearted
fellow
,
I
assure
you
;
a
very
active
,
zealous
officer
too
,
which
be
more
than
you
would
think
for
,
perhaps
,
for
that
soft
sort
of
manner
do
not
do
him
justice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
you
be
mistaken
there
,
sir
;
I
should
never
augur
want
of
spirit
from
Captain
Benwick
's
manner
.
<EOS>
I
think
them
particularly
pleasing
,
and
I
will
answer
for
it
,
they
would
generally
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
lady
be
the
good
judge
;
but
James
Benwick
be
rather
too
piano
for
me
;
and
though
very
likely
it
be
all
our
partiality
,
Sophy
and
I
can
not
help
think
Frederick
's
manner
well
than
his
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
about
Frederick
more
to
our
taste
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
be
catch
.
<EOS>
She
have
only
mean
to
oppose
the
too
common
idea
of
spirit
and
gentleness
be
incompatible
with
each
other
,
not
at
all
to
represent
Captain
Benwick
's
manner
as
the
very
good
that
could
possibly
be
;
and
,
after
a
little
hesitation
,
she
be
begin
to
say
,
"
I
be
not
enter
into
any
comparison
of
the
two
friend
,
"
but
the
admiral
interrupt
her
with
    
"
<EOS>
and
the
thing
be
certainly
true
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
mere
bit
of
gossip
.
<EOS>
We
have
it
from
Frederick
himself
.
<EOS>
His
sister
have
a
letter
from
him
yesterday
,
in
which
he
tell
us
of
it
,
and
he
have
just
have
it
in
a
letter
from
Harville
,
write
upon
the
spot
,
from
Uppercross
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
they
be
all
at
Uppercross
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
an
opportunity
which
Anne
could
not
resist
;
she
say
,
therefore
,
"
I
hope
,
Admiral
<EOS>
,
I
hope
there
be
nothing
in
the
style
of
Captain
Wentworth
's
letter
to
make
you
and
Mrs
Croft
particularly
uneasy
.
<EOS>
It
do
seem
,
last
autumn
,
as
if
there
be
an
attachment
between
him
and
Louisa
Musgrove
;
but
I
hope
it
may
be
understand
to
have
wear
out
on
each
side
equally
,
and
without
violence
.
<EOS>
I
hope
his
letter
do
not
breathe
the
spirit
of
an
ill
-
use
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
,
not
at
all
;
there
be
not
an
oath
or
a
murmur
from
begin
to
end
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
look
down
to
hide
her
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
;
Frederick
be
not
a
man
to
whine
and
complain
;
he
have
too
much
spirit
for
that
.
<EOS>
if
the
girl
like
another
man
better
,
it
be
very
fit
she
should
have
him
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
certainly
.
<EOS>
but
what
I
mean
be
,
that
I
hope
there
be
nothing
in
Captain
Wentworth
's
manner
of
write
to
make
you
suppose
he
think
himself
ill
-
use
by
his
friend
,
which
may
appear
,
you
know
,
without
its
be
absolutely
say
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
very
sorry
that
such
a
friendship
as
have
subsist
between
him
and
Captain
Benwick
should
be
destroy
,
or
even
wound
,
by
a
circumstance
of
this
sort
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
I
understand
you
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
nothing
at
all
of
that
nature
in
the
letter
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
give
the
least
fling
at
Benwick
;
do
not
so
much
as
say
,
"
I
wonder
at
it
,
I
have
a
reason
of
my
own
for
wonder
at
it
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
you
would
not
guess
,
from
his
way
of
writing
,
that
he
have
ever
think
of
this
Miss
(
what
be
her
name
?
)
<EOS>
for
himself
.
<EOS>
He
very
handsomely
hope
they
will
be
happy
together
;
and
there
be
nothing
very
unforgiving
in
that
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
Anne
do
not
receive
the
perfect
conviction
which
the
Admiral
mean
to
convey
,
but
it
would
have
be
useless
to
press
the
enquiry
farther
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
satisfy
herself
with
common
-
place
remark
or
quiet
attention
,
and
the
Admiral
have
it
all
his
own
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Frederick
!
"
say
he
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
now
he
must
begin
all
over
again
with
somebody
else
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
must
get
him
to
Bath
.
<EOS>
Sophy
must
write
,
and
beg
him
to
come
to
Bath
.
<EOS>
here
be
pretty
girl
enough
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
of
no
use
to
go
to
Uppercross
again
,
for
that
other
Miss
Musgrove
<EOS>
,
I
find
,
be
bespeak
by
her
cousin
,
the
young
parson
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
,
Miss
Elliot
,
we
have
better
try
to
get
him
to
Bath
?
"
    
<EOS>
while
Admiral
Croft
be
take
this
walk
with
Anne
,
and
express
his
wish
of
get
Captain
Wentworth
to
Bath
,
Captain
Wentworth
be
already
on
his
way
thither
.
<EOS>
before
Mrs
Croft
have
write
,
he
be
arrive
,
and
the
very
next
time
Anne
walk
out
,
she
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
be
attend
his
two
cousin
and
Mrs
Clay
.
<EOS>
They
be
in
Milsom
Street
.
<EOS>
It
begin
to
rain
,
not
much
,
but
enough
to
make
shelter
desirable
for
woman
,
and
quite
enough
to
make
it
very
desirable
for
Miss
Elliot
to
have
the
advantage
of
be
convey
home
in
Lady
Dalrymple
's
carriage
,
which
be
see
wait
at
a
little
distance
;
she
,
Anne
,
and
Mrs
Clay
,
therefore
,
turn
into
Molland
's
,
while
Mr
Elliot
step
to
Lady
Dalrymple
,
to
request
her
assistance
.
<EOS>
He
soon
join
them
again
,
successful
,
of
course
;
Lady
Dalrymple
would
be
most
happy
to
take
them
home
,
and
would
call
for
them
in
a
few
minute
.
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
's
carriage
be
a
barouche
,
and
do
not
hold
more
than
four
with
any
comfort
.
<EOS>
Miss
Carteret
be
with
her
mother
;
consequently
it
be
not
reasonable
to
expect
accommodation
for
all
the
three
Camden
Place
lady
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
Miss
Elliot
.
<EOS>
whoever
suffer
inconvenience
,
she
must
suffer
none
,
but
it
occupy
a
little
time
to
settle
the
point
of
civility
between
the
other
two
.
<EOS>
the
rain
be
a
mere
trifle
,
and
Anne
be
most
sincere
in
prefer
a
walk
with
Mr
Elliot
.
<EOS>
but
the
rain
be
also
a
mere
trifle
to
Mrs
Clay
;
she
would
hardly
allow
it
even
to
drop
at
all
,
and
her
boot
be
so
thick
!
<EOS>
much
thick
than
Miss
Anne
's
;
and
,
in
short
,
her
civility
render
her
quite
as
anxious
to
be
leave
to
walk
with
Mr
Elliot
as
Anne
could
be
,
and
it
be
discuss
between
them
with
a
generosity
so
polite
and
so
determined
,
that
the
other
be
oblige
to
settle
it
for
them
;
<EOS>
Miss
Elliot
maintain
that
Mrs
Clay
have
a
little
cold
already
,
and
Mr
Elliot
decide
on
appeal
,
that
his
cousin
Anne
's
boot
be
rather
the
thick
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
fix
accordingly
,
that
Mrs
Clay
should
be
of
the
party
in
the
carriage
;
and
they
have
just
reach
this
point
,
when
Anne
,
as
she
sit
near
the
window
,
descry
,
most
decidedly
and
distinctly
,
Captain
Wentworth
walk
down
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
Her
start
be
perceptible
only
to
herself
;
but
she
instantly
feel
that
she
be
the
great
simpleton
in
the
world
,
the
most
unaccountable
and
absurd
!
<EOS>
for
a
few
minute
she
see
nothing
before
her
;
it
be
all
confusion
.
<EOS>
She
be
lose
,
and
when
she
have
scold
back
her
sense
,
she
find
the
other
still
wait
for
the
carriage
,
and
Mr
Elliot
(
always
oblige
)
just
set
off
for
Union
Street
on
a
commission
of
Mrs
Clay
's
.
  
<EOS>
She
now
feel
a
great
inclination
to
go
to
the
outer
door
;
she
want
to
see
if
it
rain
.
<EOS>
why
be
she
to
suspect
herself
of
another
motive
?
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
must
be
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
She
leave
her
seat
,
she
would
go
;
one
half
of
her
should
not
be
always
so
much
wise
than
the
other
half
,
or
always
suspect
the
other
of
be
bad
than
it
be
.
<EOS>
She
would
see
if
it
rain
.
<EOS>
She
be
send
back
,
however
,
in
a
moment
by
the
entrance
of
Captain
Wentworth
himself
,
among
a
party
of
gentleman
and
lady
,
evidently
his
acquaintance
,
and
whom
he
must
have
join
a
little
below
Milsom
Street
.
<EOS>
He
be
more
obviously
strike
and
confuse
by
the
sight
of
her
than
she
have
ever
observe
before
;
he
look
quite
red
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
,
since
their
renew
acquaintance
,
she
feel
that
she
be
betray
the
least
sensibility
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
She
have
the
advantage
of
him
in
the
preparation
of
the
last
few
moment
.
<EOS>
all
the
overpowering
,
blind
,
bewildering
,
first
effect
of
strong
surprise
be
over
with
her
.
<EOS>
still
,
however
,
she
have
enough
to
feel
!
<EOS>
It
be
agitation
,
pain
,
pleasure
,
a
something
between
delight
and
misery
.
  
<EOS>
He
speak
to
her
,
and
then
turn
away
.
<EOS>
the
character
of
his
manner
be
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
have
call
it
either
cold
or
friendly
,
or
anything
so
certainly
as
embarrassed
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
short
interval
,
however
,
he
come
towards
her
,
and
speak
again
.
<EOS>
mutual
enquiry
on
common
subject
pass
:
neither
of
them
,
probably
,
much
the
wiser
for
what
they
hear
,
and
Anne
continue
fully
sensible
of
his
be
less
at
ease
than
formerly
.
<EOS>
They
have
by
dint
of
be
so
very
much
together
,
get
to
speak
to
each
other
with
a
considerable
portion
of
apparent
indifference
and
calmness
;
but
he
could
not
do
it
now
.
<EOS>
Time
have
change
him
,
or
Louisa
have
change
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
consciousness
of
some
sort
or
other
.
<EOS>
He
look
very
well
,
not
as
if
he
have
be
suffer
in
health
or
spirit
,
and
he
talk
of
Uppercross
,
of
the
Musgroves
,
nay
,
even
of
Louisa
,
and
have
even
a
momentary
look
of
his
own
arch
significance
as
he
name
her
;
but
yet
it
be
Captain
Wentworth
not
comfortable
,
not
easy
,
not
able
to
feign
that
he
be
.
  
<EOS>
It
do
not
surprise
,
but
it
grieve
Anne
to
observe
that
Elizabeth
would
not
know
him
.
<EOS>
She
see
that
he
see
Elizabeth
,
that
Elizabeth
see
him
,
that
there
be
complete
internal
recognition
on
each
side
;
she
be
convince
that
he
be
ready
to
be
acknowledge
as
an
acquaintance
,
expect
it
,
and
she
have
the
pain
of
see
her
sister
turn
away
with
unalterable
coldness
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Dalrymple
's
carriage
,
for
which
Miss
Elliot
be
grow
very
impatient
,
now
draw
up
;
the
servant
come
in
to
announce
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
begin
to
rain
again
,
and
altogether
there
be
a
delay
,
and
a
bustle
,
and
a
talking
,
which
must
make
all
the
little
crowd
in
the
shop
understand
that
Lady
Dalrymple
be
call
to
convey
Miss
Elliot
.
<EOS>
at
last
Miss
Elliot
and
her
friend
,
unattende
but
by
the
servant
,
(
for
there
be
no
cousin
return
)
,
be
walk
off
;
and
Captain
Wentworth
,
watch
them
,
turn
again
to
Anne
,
and
by
manner
,
rather
than
word
,
be
offer
his
service
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
much
oblige
to
you
,
"
be
her
answer
,
"
but
I
be
not
go
with
them
.
<EOS>
the
carriage
would
not
accommodate
so
many
.
<EOS>
I
walk
:
I
prefer
walk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
rain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
very
little
,
nothing
that
I
regard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
a
moment
's
pause
he
say
:
"
though
I
come
only
yesterday
,
I
have
equip
myself
properly
for
Bath
already
<EOS>
,
you
see
,
"
(
point
to
a
new
umbrella
)
;
"
I
wish
you
would
make
use
of
it
,
if
you
be
determined
to
walk
;
though
I
think
it
would
be
more
prudent
to
let
me
get
you
a
chair
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
very
much
oblige
to
him
,
but
decline
it
all
,
repeat
her
conviction
,
that
the
rain
would
come
to
nothing
at
present
,
and
add
,
"
I
be
only
wait
for
Mr
Elliot
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
here
in
a
moment
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
have
hardly
speak
the
word
when
Mr
Elliot
walk
in
.
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
recollect
him
perfectly
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
difference
between
him
and
the
man
who
have
stand
on
the
step
at
Lyme
,
admire
Anne
as
she
pass
,
except
in
the
air
and
look
and
manner
of
the
privileged
relation
and
friend
.
<EOS>
He
come
in
with
eagerness
,
appear
to
see
and
think
only
of
her
,
apologise
for
his
stay
,
be
grieve
to
have
keep
her
waiting
,
and
anxious
to
get
her
away
without
further
loss
of
time
and
before
the
rain
increase
;
and
in
another
moment
they
walk
off
together
,
her
arm
under
his
,
a
gentle
and
embarrassed
glance
,
and
a
"
good
morning
to
you
!
"
<EOS>
be
all
that
she
have
time
for
,
as
she
pass
away
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
be
out
of
sight
,
the
lady
of
Captain
Wentworth
's
party
begin
talk
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Elliot
do
not
dislike
his
cousin
,
I
fancy
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
no
,
that
be
clear
enough
.
<EOS>
one
can
guess
what
will
happen
there
.
<EOS>
He
be
always
with
them
;
half
live
in
the
family
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
what
a
very
good
-
looking
man
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
and
Miss
Atkinson
,
who
dine
with
him
once
at
the
Wallises
,
say
he
be
the
most
agreeable
man
she
ever
be
in
company
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
pretty
,
I
think
;
Anne
Elliot
;
very
pretty
,
when
one
come
to
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
fashion
to
say
so
,
but
I
confess
I
admire
her
more
than
her
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
so
do
I.
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
so
do
I.
no
comparison
.
<EOS>
but
the
man
be
all
wild
after
Miss
Elliot
.
<EOS>
Anne
be
too
delicate
for
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
would
have
be
particularly
oblige
to
her
cousin
,
if
he
would
have
walk
by
her
side
all
the
way
to
Camden
Place
,
without
say
a
word
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
find
it
so
difficult
to
listen
to
him
,
though
nothing
could
exceed
his
solicitude
and
care
,
and
though
his
subject
be
principally
such
as
be
will
not
to
be
always
interesting
:
praise
,
warm
,
just
,
and
discriminate
,
of
Lady
Russell
,
and
insinuation
highly
rational
against
Mrs
Clay
.
<EOS>
but
just
now
she
could
think
only
of
Captain
Wentworth
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
understand
his
present
feeling
,
whether
he
be
really
suffer
much
from
disappointment
or
not
;
and
till
that
point
be
settle
,
she
could
not
be
quite
herself
.
  
<EOS>
She
hope
to
be
wise
and
reasonable
in
time
;
but
alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
she
must
confess
to
herself
that
she
be
not
wise
yet
.
  
<EOS>
another
circumstance
very
essential
for
her
to
know
,
be
how
long
he
mean
to
be
in
Bath
;
he
have
not
mention
it
,
or
she
could
not
recollect
it
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
only
pass
through
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
more
probable
that
he
should
be
come
to
stay
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
,
so
liable
as
every
body
be
to
meet
every
body
in
Bath
,
Lady
Russell
would
in
all
likelihood
see
him
somewhere
.
<EOS>
Would
she
recollect
him
?
<EOS>
how
would
it
all
be
?
  
<EOS>
She
have
already
be
oblige
to
tell
Lady
Russell
that
Louisa
Musgrove
be
to
marry
Captain
Benwick
.
<EOS>
It
have
cost
her
something
to
encounter
Lady
Russell
's
surprise
;
and
now
,
if
she
be
by
any
chance
to
be
throw
into
company
with
Captain
Wentworth
,
her
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
matter
may
add
another
shade
of
prejudice
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
follow
morning
Anne
be
out
with
her
friend
,
and
for
the
first
hour
,
in
an
incessant
and
fearful
sort
of
watch
for
him
in
vain
;
but
at
last
,
in
return
down
Pulteney
Street
,
she
distinguish
him
on
the
right
hand
pavement
at
such
a
distance
as
to
have
him
in
view
the
great
part
of
the
street
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
other
man
about
him
,
many
group
walk
the
same
way
,
but
there
be
no
mistake
him
.
<EOS>
She
look
instinctively
at
Lady
Russell
;
but
not
from
any
mad
idea
of
her
recognise
him
so
soon
as
she
do
herself
.
<EOS>
no
,
it
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
Lady
Russell
would
perceive
him
till
they
be
nearly
opposite
.
<EOS>
She
look
at
her
however
,
from
time
to
time
,
anxiously
;
and
when
the
moment
approach
which
must
point
him
out
,
though
not
dare
to
look
again
(
for
her
own
countenance
she
know
be
unfit
to
be
see
)
<EOS>
,
she
be
yet
perfectly
conscious
of
Lady
Russell
's
eye
be
turn
exactly
in
the
direction
for
him
 
of
her
being
,
in
short
,
intently
observe
him
.
<EOS>
She
could
thoroughly
comprehend
the
sort
of
fascination
he
must
possess
over
Lady
Russell
's
mind
,
the
difficulty
it
must
be
for
her
to
withdraw
her
eye
,
the
astonishment
she
must
be
feel
that
eight
or
nine
year
should
have
pass
over
him
,
and
in
foreign
clime
and
in
active
service
too
,
without
rob
him
of
one
personal
grace
!
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
Lady
Russell
draw
back
her
head
.
"
<EOS>
now
,
how
would
she
speak
of
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
wonder
,
"
say
she
,
"
what
have
be
fix
my
eye
so
long
;
but
I
be
look
after
some
window
-
curtain
,
which
Lady
Alicia
and
Mrs
Frankland
be
tell
me
of
last
night
.
<EOS>
They
describe
the
drawing
-
room
window
-
curtain
of
one
of
the
house
on
this
side
of
the
way
,
and
this
part
of
the
street
,
as
be
the
handsome
and
best
hung
of
any
in
Bath
,
but
could
not
recollect
the
exact
number
,
and
I
have
be
try
to
find
out
which
it
could
be
;
but
I
confess
I
can
see
no
curtain
hereabouts
that
answer
their
description
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
sigh
and
blush
and
smile
,
in
pity
and
disdain
,
either
at
her
friend
or
herself
.
<EOS>
the
part
which
provoke
her
most
,
be
that
in
all
this
waste
of
foresight
and
caution
,
she
should
have
lose
the
right
moment
for
see
whether
he
see
them
.
  
<EOS>
a
day
or
two
pass
without
produce
anything
.
<EOS>
the
theatre
or
the
room
,
where
he
be
most
likely
to
be
,
be
not
fashionable
enough
for
the
Elliots
,
whose
evening
amusement
be
solely
in
the
elegant
stupidity
of
private
party
,
in
which
they
be
get
more
and
more
engaged
;
and
Anne
,
weary
of
such
a
state
of
stagnation
,
sick
of
know
nothing
,
and
fancy
herself
strong
because
her
strength
be
not
try
,
be
quite
impatient
for
the
concert
evening
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
concert
for
the
benefit
of
a
person
patronise
by
Lady
Dalrymple
.
<EOS>
of
course
they
must
attend
.
<EOS>
It
be
really
expect
to
be
a
good
one
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
be
very
fond
of
music
.
<EOS>
if
she
could
only
have
a
few
minute
conversation
with
him
again
,
she
fancy
she
should
be
satisfied
;
and
as
to
the
power
of
address
him
,
she
feel
all
over
courage
if
the
opportunity
occur
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
have
turn
from
him
,
Lady
Russell
overlook
him
;
her
nerve
be
strengthen
by
these
circumstance
;
she
feel
that
she
owe
him
attention
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
once
partly
promise
Mrs
Smith
to
spend
the
evening
with
her
;
but
in
a
short
hurry
call
she
excuse
herself
and
put
it
off
,
with
the
more
decided
promise
of
a
long
visit
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Smith
give
a
most
good
-
humoured
acquiescence
.
  
<EOS>
"
by
all
mean
,
"
say
she
;
"
only
tell
me
all
about
it
,
when
you
do
come
.
<EOS>
who
be
your
party
?
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
name
them
all
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Smith
make
no
reply
;
but
when
she
be
leave
her
say
,
and
with
an
expression
half
serious
,
half
arch
,
"
well
,
I
heartily
wish
your
concert
may
answer
;
and
do
not
fail
me
to
-
morrow
if
you
can
come
;
for
I
begin
to
have
a
foreboding
that
I
may
not
have
many
more
visit
from
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
be
startle
and
confused
;
but
after
stand
in
a
moment
's
suspense
,
be
oblige
,
and
not
sorry
to
be
oblige
,
to
hurry
away
.
    
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
,
his
two
daughter
,
and
Mrs
Clay
,
be
the
early
of
all
their
party
at
the
room
in
the
evening
;
and
as
Lady
Dalrymple
must
be
wait
for
,
they
take
their
station
by
one
of
the
fire
in
the
Octagon
Room
.
<EOS>
but
hardly
be
they
so
settle
,
when
the
door
open
again
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
walk
in
alone
.
<EOS>
Anne
be
the
near
to
him
,
and
make
yet
a
little
advance
,
she
instantly
speak
.
<EOS>
He
be
prepare
only
to
bow
and
pass
on
,
but
her
gentle
"
how
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
bring
him
out
of
the
straight
line
to
stand
near
her
,
and
make
enquiry
in
return
,
in
spite
of
the
formidable
father
and
sister
in
the
back
ground
.
<EOS>
Their
being
in
the
back
ground
be
a
support
to
Anne
;
she
know
nothing
of
their
look
,
and
feel
equal
to
everything
which
she
believe
right
to
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
while
they
be
speak
,
a
whispering
between
her
father
and
Elizabeth
catch
her
ear
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
distinguish
,
but
she
must
guess
the
subject
;
and
on
Captain
Wentworth
's
make
a
distant
bow
<EOS>
,
she
comprehend
that
her
father
have
judge
so
well
as
to
give
him
that
simple
acknowledgement
of
acquaintance
,
and
she
be
just
in
time
by
a
side
glance
to
see
a
slight
curtsey
from
Elizabeth
herself
.
<EOS>
this
,
though
late
,
and
reluctant
,
and
ungracious
,
be
yet
well
than
nothing
,
and
her
spirit
improve
.
  
<EOS>
after
talk
,
however
,
of
the
weather
,
and
Bath
,
and
the
concert
,
their
conversation
begin
to
flag
,
and
so
little
be
say
at
last
,
that
she
be
expect
him
to
go
every
moment
,
but
he
do
not
<EOS>
;
he
seem
in
no
hurry
to
leave
her
;
and
presently
with
renew
spirit
,
with
a
little
smile
,
a
little
glow
,
he
say
    
"
I
have
hardly
see
you
since
our
day
at
Lyme
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
you
must
have
suffer
from
the
shock
,
and
the
more
from
its
not
overpower
you
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
assure
him
that
she
have
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
frightful
hour
,
"
say
he
,
"
a
frightful
day
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
pass
his
hand
across
his
eye
,
as
if
the
remembrance
be
still
too
painful
,
but
in
a
moment
,
half
smile
again
,
add
,
"
the
day
have
produce
some
effect
however
;
have
have
some
consequence
which
must
be
consider
as
the
very
reverse
of
frightful
.
<EOS>
when
you
have
the
presence
of
mind
to
suggest
that
Benwick
would
be
the
proper
person
to
fetch
a
surgeon
,
you
could
have
little
idea
of
his
be
eventually
one
of
those
most
concerned
in
her
recovery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
I
could
have
none
.
<EOS>
but
it
appear
 
I
should
hope
it
would
be
a
very
happy
match
.
<EOS>
there
be
on
both
side
good
principle
and
good
temper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
he
,
look
not
exactly
forward
;
"
but
there
,
I
think
,
end
the
resemblance
.
<EOS>
with
all
my
soul
I
wish
them
happy
,
and
rejoice
over
every
circumstance
in
favour
of
it
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
difficulty
to
contend
with
at
home
,
no
opposition
,
no
caprice
,
no
delay
.
<EOS>
the
musgrove
be
behave
like
themselves
,
most
honourably
and
kindly
,
only
anxious
with
true
parental
heart
to
promote
their
daughter
's
comfort
.
<EOS>
all
this
be
much
,
very
much
in
favour
of
their
happiness
;
more
than
perhaps
 
"
  
He
stop
.
<EOS>
a
sudden
recollection
seem
to
occur
,
and
to
give
him
some
taste
of
that
emotion
which
be
redden
Anne
's
cheek
and
fix
her
eye
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
after
clear
his
throat
,
however
,
he
proceed
thus
    
<EOS>
"
I
confess
that
I
do
think
there
be
a
disparity
,
too
great
a
disparity
,
and
in
a
point
no
less
essential
than
mind
.
<EOS>
I
regard
Louisa
Musgrove
as
a
very
amiable
,
sweet
-
tempered
girl
,
and
not
deficient
in
understanding
,
but
Benwick
be
something
more
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
clever
man
,
a
reading
man
;
and
I
confess
,
that
I
do
consider
his
attach
himself
to
her
with
some
surprise
.
<EOS>
have
it
be
the
effect
of
gratitude
,
<EOS>
have
he
learn
to
love
her
,
because
he
believe
her
to
be
prefer
him
,
it
would
have
be
another
thing
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
no
reason
to
suppose
it
so
.
<EOS>
It
seem
,
on
the
contrary
,
to
have
be
a
perfectly
spontaneous
,
untaught
feel
on
his
side

and
this
surprise
me

<EOS>
a
man
like
him

in
his
situation

<EOS>
with
a
heart
pierce
,
wound
,
<EOS>
almost
broken
!
<EOS>
Fanny
Harville
be
a
very
superior
creature
,
and
his
attachment
to
her
be
indeed
attachment
.
<EOS>
a
man
do
not
recover
from
such
a
devotion
of
the
heart
to
such
a
woman
.
<EOS>
He
ought
not
;
he
do
not

<EOS>
either
from
the
consciousness
,
however
,
that
his
friend
have
recover
,
or
from
other
consciousness

he
go
no
farther
;
and
Anne
who
,
in
spite
of
the
agitated
voice
in
which
the
latter
part
have
be
utter
,
and
in
spite
of
all
the
various
noise
of
the
room

the
almost
ceaseless
slam

ceaseless
buzz

begin
to
breathe
very
quick

and
feel
an
hundred
thing
in
a
moment

<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
her
to
enter
on
such
a
subject
;
and
yet
,
after
a
pause
,
feel
the
necessity
of
speak
,
and
have
not
the
small
wish
for
a
total
change

so
far

You

good
while
at
Lyme

I

I

I

very

to

Lyme
again

Anne

"
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
suppose
that
you
could
have
find
anything
in
Lyme
to
inspire
such
a
feeling
.
<EOS>
the
horror
and
distress
you
be
involve
in
,
the
stretch
of
mind
,
the
wear
of
spirit
!
<EOS>
I
should
have
think
your

impression
of
Lyme
must
have
be
strong
disgust
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
last
hour
be
certainly
very
painful

reply
Anne

"
but
when
pain
be
over
,
the
remembrance
of
it

become
a
pleasure

one
do
not

have
suffer

unless
it
have
be
all
suffer

nothing

suffering

which
be
by
no

the
case
at
Lyme

<EOS>
We
be
only
in
anxiety
and
distress
during
the
last
two
hour
,
and
previously
there
have
be
a
great
deal
of
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
so
much
novelty
and
beauty
!
<EOS>
I
have
travel
so
little
,
that
every
fresh
place
would
be
interesting
to
me
;
but
there
be
real
beauty
at
Lyme
;

in
short

(
with
a
faint
blush
at
some
recollection
)
,
"
altogether
my
impression
of
the
place
be
very
agreeable

it

also
necessarily

She

Captain
Wentworth

<EOS>
Their
interesting
,
almost
too
interesting
conversation
must
be
break
up
for
a
time
,
but
slight
be
the
penance
compare
with
the
happiness
which
bring
it
on
!
<EOS>
She
have
learn
,
in
the
last
ten
minute
,
more
of
his
feeling
towards
Louisa
,
more
of
all
his
feeling
than
she
dare
to
think
of
;
and
she
give
herself
up
to
the
demand
of
the
party
,
to
the
needful
civility
of
the
moment
,
with
exquisite
,
though
agitated
sensation

She

in
good
humour

She

He

look

he
would
find

out
before

evening

over

and
at

perhaps
,
it
be
as
well
to
be
asunder

<EOS>
She

in

a
little
interval
for
recollection

"
  
<EOS>
upon
Lady
Russell
's
appearance
soon
afterwards
,
the
whole
party
be
collect

all
that
remain
be
to
marshal
themselves
,
and
proceed
into
the
Concert
Room
;
and
be
of
all
the
consequence
in
their
power
,
draw
as
many
eye
,
excite
as
many
whisper

and
disturb
as
many
people
as
they
could

<EOS>
very
,
very
happy
be
both
Elizabeth
and
Anne
Elliot
as
they
walk
in
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
arm
in
arm
with
Miss
Carteret
,
and
look
on
the
broad
back
of
the
dowager
Viscountess
Dalrymple
before
her
,
have
nothing
to
wish
for
which
do
not
seem
within
her
reach
;
and
Anne
 
<EOS>
but
it
would
be
an
insult
to
the
nature
of
Anne
's
felicity
,
to
draw
any
comparison
between
it
and
her
sister
's
;
the
origin
of
one
all
selfish
vanity
,
of
the
other
all
generous
attachment
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
see
nothing
,
think
nothing
of
the
brilliancy
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Her
happiness
be
from
within
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
be
bright
and
her
cheek
glow
;
but
she
know
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
think
only
of
the
last
half
hour
,
and
as
they
pass
to
their
seat
,
her
mind
take
a
hasty
range
over
it
.
<EOS>
His
choice
of
subject
,
his
expression
,
and
still
more
his
manner
and
look
,
have
be
such
as
she
could
see
in
only
one
light
.
<EOS>
His
opinion
of
Louisa
Musgrove
's
inferiority
,
an
opinion
which
he
have
seem
solicitous
to
give
,
his
wonder
at
Captain
Benwick
,
his
feeling
as
to
a
first
,
strong
attachment
;
sentence
begin
which
he
could
not
finish
,
his
half
avert
eye
and
more
than
half
expressive
glance
,
all
,
all
declare
that
he
have
a
heart
return
to
her
at
least
;
that
anger
,
resentment
,
avoidance
,
be
no
more
;
and
that
they
be
succeed
,
not
merely
by
friendship
and
regard
,
but
by
the
tenderness
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
yes
,
some
share
of
the
tenderness
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
contemplate
the
change
as
imply
less
.
<EOS>
He
must
love
her
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
thought
,
with
their
attendant
vision
,
which
occupy
and
flurry
her
too
much
to
leave
her
any
power
of
observation
;
and
she
pass
along
the
room
without
have
a
glimpse
of
him
,
without
even
try
to
discern
him
.
<EOS>
when
their
place
be
determine
on
,
and
they
be
all
properly
arrange
,
she
look
round
to
see
if
he
should
happen
to
be
in
the
same
part
of
the
room
,
but
he
be
not
;
her
eye
could
not
reach
him
;
and
the
concert
be
just
open
,
she
must
consent
for
a
time
to
be
happy
in
a
humbler
way
.
  
<EOS>
the
party
be
divide
and
dispose
of
on
two
contiguous
bench
:
Anne
be
among
those
on
the
foremost
,
and
Mr
Elliot
have
manoeuvre
so
well
,
with
the
assistance
of
his
friend
Colonel
Wallis
,
as
to
have
a
seat
by
her
.
<EOS>
Miss
Elliot
,
surround
by
her
cousin
,
and
the
principal
object
of
Colonel
Wallis
's
gallantry
,
be
quite
contented
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
's
mind
be
in
a
most
favourable
state
for
the
entertainment
of
the
evening
;
it
be
just
occupation
enough
:
she
have
feeling
for
the
tender
,
spirit
for
the
gay
,
attention
for
the
scientific
,
and
patience
for
the
wearisome
;
and
have
never
like
a
concert
better
,
at
least
during
the
first
act
.
<EOS>
towards
the
close
of
it

in
the
interval
succeed
an
italian
song
,
she
explain
the
word
of
the
song
to
Mr
Elliot

<EOS>
They
have
a
concert
bill
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
,
"
say
she
,
"
be
nearly
the
sense
,
or
rather
the
meaning
of
the
word
,
for
certainly
the
sense
of
an
italian
love
-
song
must
not
be
talk
of
,
but
it
be
as
nearly
the
meaning
as
I
can
give
;
for
I
do
not
pretend
to
understand
the
language
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
very
poor
italian
scholar
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

yes

I
see
you

<EOS>
I

You

knowledge
enough

these
invert
,
transpose
,
curtail
italian

into
clear

comprehensible

elegant
English

You
need
not

anything
more
of
your
ignorance

<EOS>
here
be
complete
proof

<EOS>
"
I
will
not
oppose
such
kind
politeness

I

Place
so
long

he
,
"
without
know
something
of
Miss
Anne
Elliot

I
do
regard
her
as
one
who
be
too
modest
for
the
world
in
general
to
be
aware
of
half
her
accomplishment

highly
accomplished

Mr

speak
low

You

<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
be
not

in
the
interest

hope
to

<EOS>
no

can

the
charm

such

have

irresistible

eagerly

such

he
could
assure
her

the
fact

He
have
many
year

receive
such
a
description
of
Miss
Anne

as
have

him

<EOS>
Anne

so
likely

speak
with
partiality

her
many
year

as
the
Mr
Wentworth

Captain

He

his
seem
to

withdraw
from

It
have
that
appearance

It
seem
as
if
she
have
be
one
moment
too
late

as
long

she
dare
observe

he
do
not
look
again

the
performance
be
recommence

she
be
force

seem
to
restore
her
attention
to
the
orchestra

look
straight
forward

<EOS>
when
she
could
give
another
glance

away

<EOS>
He
could
not

come
near

her
if
he
would

she
be
so
surround

shut
in

she
would
rather
have
catch
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Mr

's
speech

too

distress
her

<EOS>
She
have
no
longer
any
inclination

the
first
act

over

now
she
hope
for
some
beneficial
change

,
after
a
period
of
nothing
-
say
amongst
the
party
,
some
of
them
do
decide
on
go
in
quest
of
tea
.
<EOS>
Anne
be
one
of
the
few
who
do
not
choose
to
move
.
<EOS>
She
remain
in
her
seat
,
and
so
do
Lady
Russell
;
but
she
have
the
pleasure
of
get
rid
of
Mr

;
and
she
do
not
mean
,
whatever
she
may
feel
on
Lady
Russell
's
account

to
shrink
from
conversation
with
Captain

her
the
opportunity

<EOS>
the
other
return

the

fill
again
,
bench
be
reclaim
and
repossess

and
another
hour
of
pleasure

of
penance
be
to

sit
out

<EOS>
another
hour
of

be
to
give
delight

<EOS>
to
Anne

wear
the
prospect

She
could
not

refuse
,
to
sit
between
them
;
and
by
some
other
removal
,
and
a
little
scheming
of
her
own
,
Anne
be
enable
to
place
herself
much
near
the
end
of
the
bench
than
she
have
be
before
,
much
more
within
reach
of
a
passer
-
by
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
do
so
,
without
compare
herself
with
Miss
Larolles
,
the
inimitable
Miss
Larolles
;
but
still
she
do
it
,
and
not
with
much
happy
effect
;
though
by
what
seem
prosperity
in
the
shape
of
an
early
abdication
in
her
next
neighbour
,
she
find
herself
at
the
very
end
of
the
bench
before
the
concert
close
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
her
situation
,
with
a
vacant
space
at
hand
,
when
Captain
Wentworth
be
again
in
sight
.
<EOS>
She
see
him
not
far
off
.
<EOS>
He
see
her
too
;
yet
he
look
grave
,
and
seem
irresolute
,
and
only
by
very
slow
degree
come
at
last
near
enough
to
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
something
must
be
the
matter
.
<EOS>
the
change
be
indubitable
.
<EOS>
the
difference
between
his
present
air
and
what
it
have
be
in
the
Octagon
Room
be
strikingly
great
.
<EOS>
why
be
it
?
<EOS>
She
think
of
her
father
,
of
Lady
Russell
.
<EOS>
Could
there
have
be
any
unpleasant
glance
?
<EOS>
He
begin
by
speak
of
the
concert
gravely
,
more
like
the
Captain
Wentworth
of
Uppercross
;
own
himself
disappoint
,
have
expect
singe
;
and
in
short
,
must
confess
that
he
should
not
be
sorry
when
it
be
over
.
<EOS>
Anne
reply
,
and
speak
in
defence
of
the
performance
so
well
,
and
yet
in
allowance
for
his
feeling
so
pleasantly
,
that
his
countenance
improve
,
and
he
reply
again
with
almost
a
smile
.
<EOS>
They
talk
for
a
few
minute
more
;
the
improvement
hold
;
he
even
look
down
towards
the
bench
,
as
if
he
see
a
place
on
it
well
worth
occupy
;
when
at
that
moment
a
touch
on
her
shoulder
oblige
Anne
to
turn
round
.
<EOS>
It
come
from
Mr
Elliot
.
<EOS>
He
beg
her
pardon
,
but
she
must
be
apply
to
,
to
explain
Italian
again
.
<EOS>
Miss
Carteret
be
very
anxious
to
have
a
general
idea
of
what
be
next
to
be
sing
.
<EOS>
Anne
could
not
refuse
;
but
never
have
she
sacrifice
to
politeness
with
a
more
suffering
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
a
few
minute
,
though
as
few
as
possible
,
be
inevitably
consume
;
and
when
her
own
mistress
again
,
when
able
to
turn
and
look
as
she
have
do
before
,
she
find
herself
accost
by
Captain
Wentworth
,
in
a
reserved
yet
hurried
sort
of
farewell
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
must
wish
her
good
night
;
he
be
go
;
he
should
get
home
as
fast
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
be
not
this
song
worth
stay
for
?
"
say
Anne
,
suddenly
strike
by
an
idea
which
make
her
yet
more
anxious
to
be
encouraging
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
!
"
<EOS>
he
reply
impressively
,
"
there
be
nothing
worth
my
staying
for
;
"
and
he
be
go
directly
.
  
<EOS>
jealousy
of
Mr
Elliot
!
<EOS>
It
be
the
only
intelligible
motive
.
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
jealous
of
her
affection
!
<EOS>
Could
she
have
believe
it
a
week
ago
;
three
hour
ago
!
<EOS>
for
a
moment
the
gratification
be
exquisite
.
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
there
be
very
different
thought
to
succeed
.
<EOS>
how
be
such
jealousy
to
be
quiet
?
<EOS>
how
be
the
truth
to
reach
him
?
<EOS>
how
,
in
all
the
peculiar
disadvantage
of
their
respective
situation
,
would
he
ever
learn
of
her
real
sentiment
?
<EOS>
It
be
misery
to
think
of
Mr
Elliot
's
attention
.
<EOS>
Their
evil
be
incalculable
.
    
<EOS>
Anne
recollect
with
pleasure
the
next
morning
her
promise
of
go
to
Mrs
Smith
,
mean
that
it
should
engage
her
from
home
at
the
time
when
Mr
Elliot
would
be
most
likely
to
call
;
for
to
avoid
Mr
Elliot
be
almost
a
first
object
.
  
<EOS>
She
feel
a
great
deal
of
good
-
will
towards
him
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
the
mischief
of
his
attention
,
she
owe
him
gratitude
and
regard
,
perhaps
compassion
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
help
think
much
of
the
extraordinary
circumstance
attend
their
acquaintance
,
of
the
right
which
he
seem
to
have
to
interest
her
,
by
everything
in
situation
,
by
his
own
sentiment
,
by
his
early
prepossession
.
<EOS>
It
be
altogether
very
extraordinary
;
flattering
,
but
painful
.
<EOS>
there
be
much
to
regret
.
<EOS>
how
she
may
have
feel
have
there
be
no
Captain
Wentworth
in
the
case
,
be
not
worth
enquiry
;
for
there
be
a
Captain
Wentworth
;
and
be
the
conclusion
of
the
present
suspense
good
or
bad
,
her
affection
would
be
his
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Their
union
,
she
believe
,
could
not
divide
her
more
from
other
man
,
than
their
final
separation
.
  
<EOS>
prettier
musing
of
high
-
wrought
love
and
eternal
constancy
,
could
never
have
pass
along
the
street
of
Bath
,
than
Anne
be
sport
with
from
Camden
Place
to
Westgate
Buildings
.
<EOS>
It
be
almost
enough
to
spread
purification
and
perfume
all
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
sure
of
a
pleasant
reception
;
and
her
friend
seem
this
morning
particularly
oblige
to
her
for
come
,
seem
hardly
to
have
expect
her
,
though
it
have
be
an
appointment
.
  
<EOS>
an
account
of
the
concert
be
immediately
claim
;
and
Anne
's
recollection
of
the
concert
be
quite
happy
enough
to
animate
her
feature
and
make
her
rejoice
to
talk
of
it
.
<EOS>
all
that
she
could
tell
she
tell
most
gladly
,
but
the
all
be
little
for
one
who
have
be
there
,
and
unsatisfactory
for
such
an
enquirer
as
Mrs
Smith
,
who
have
already
hear
,
through
the
short
cut
of
a
laundress
and
a
waiter
,
rather
more
of
the
general
success
and
produce
of
the
evening
than
Anne
could
relate
,
and
who
now
ask
in
vain
for
several
particular
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
everybody
of
any
consequence
or
notoriety
in
Bath
be
well
know
by
name
to
Mrs
Smith
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
little
Durands
be
there
,
I
conclude
,
"
say
she
,
"
with
their
mouth
open
to
catch
the
music
,
like
unfledged
sparrow
ready
to
be
feed

<EOS>
They
never
miss
a
concert
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
do
not
see
them
myself
,
but
I
hear
Mr
Elliot
say
they
be
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
Ibbotsons

they
there

one
of
them

Old
Lady
Mary
Maclean

<EOS>
I
need
not
ask
after
her
.
<EOS>
She
never
miss
,
I
know
;
and
you
must
have
see
her
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
be
in
your
own
circle
;
for
as
you
go
with
Lady
Dalrymple
,
you
be
in
the
seat
of
grandeur
,
round
the
orchestra
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
that
be
what
I
dread
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
very
unpleasant
to
me
in
every
respect
.
<EOS>
but
happily
Lady
Dalrymple
always
choose
to
be
farther
off
;
and
we
be
exceedingly
well
place
,
that
is
,
for
hearing
;
I
must
not
say
for
seeing
,
because
I
appear
to
have
see
very
little
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
you
see
enough
for
your
own
amusement

<EOS>
I
can
understand
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
sort
of
domestic
enjoyment
to
be
know
even
in
a
crowd
,
and
this
you
have
.
<EOS>
You
be
a
large
party
in
yourself
,
and
you
want
nothing
beyond
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
ought
to
have
look
about
me
more
,
"
say
Anne
,
conscious
while
she
speak
that
there
have
in
fact
be
no
want
of
look
about
,
that
the
object
only
have
be
deficient

<EOS>
"
no
,
no
;
you
be
better
employ
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
tell
me
that
you
have
a
pleasant
evening
.
<EOS>
I
see
it
in
your
eye

<EOS>
I
perfectly
see
how
the
hour
pass
:
that
you
have
always
something
agreeable
to
listen
to

<EOS>
in
the
interval
of
the
concert
it
be
conversation

Anne
half
smile

"
yes

Your

company
last
night

the
most

<EOS>
a
blush
overspread
Anne
's
cheek

She
could
say
nothing

such
be
the
case

continue
Mrs

,
after

short
pause
,

I
hope

It

good

unable

short
silence

Mrs

Mr

well

my

I

Mr

sense
to
understand
the
value
of

Your
peace
will
not

You

He

<EOS>
"
no

Anne

I
can
readily
believe
all
that
of
my
cousin

<EOS>
He
seem
to
have
a
calm
decide
temper
,
not
at
all
open
to
dangerous
impression

<EOS>
I
consider
him
with
great
respect

<EOS>
I
have
no
reason

from
any
thing
that
have
fall
within

do
otherwise

I
have
not

he

not

think

intimately

<EOS>
Will
not
this
manner

speak

him

Mrs
Smith
,
convince
you
that
he
be
nothing

<EOS>
surely
this
must
be
calm
enough

<EOS>
and
,
upon
my
word
,
he
be
nothing

<EOS>
Should
he
ever
propose

(
which
I
have
very
little
reason

I
shall
not

him

<EOS>
I
assure
you
I

I
assure
you

Mr

<EOS>
Mrs

would
hardly

I
beg
your

the
short
answer
I

give
you

I
have
be
uncertain
what
I
ought

<EOS>
I
have
be
doubt

consider
as
to
what
I
ought
to
tell
you

<EOS>
there
be
many
thing
to
be
take
into
the
account
.
<EOS>
one
hate
to
be
officious
,
to
be
give
bad
impression

make
mischief

<EOS>
even
the
smooth
surface
of
family

union
seem
worth
preserving

though
there
may
be
nothing
durable
beneath
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
have
determine
;
I
think
I
be
right
;
I
think
you
ought
to
be
make
acquainted
with
Mr
Elliot
's
real
character
.
<EOS>
though
I
fully
believe
that
,
at

you
have
not

be
no

what
may
happen

You
may
,
some
time

be
differently
affect
towards
him

hear
the
truth
,
therefore
,
now
,
while
you
be
unprejudiced
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
be
a
man
without
heart
or
conscience
;
a
designing
,
wary
,
cold
-
blooded
being
,
who
think
only
of
himself
;
whom
for
his
own
interest
or
ease
,
would
be
guilty
of
any
cruelty
,
or
any
treachery
,
that
could
be
perpetrate
without
risk
of
his
general
character
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
feeling
for
other
.
<EOS>
those
whom
he
have
be
the
chief
cause
of
lead
into
ruin
,
he
can
neglect
and
desert
without
the
small
compunction
.
<EOS>
He
be
totally
beyond
the
reach
of
any
sentiment
of
justice
or
compassion
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
he
be
black
at
heart
,
hollow
and
black
!

<EOS>
Anne
's
astonished
air
,
and
exclamation
of
wonder
,
make
her
pause
,
and
in
a
calm
manner
,
she
add
,
  
"
My
expression
startle
you
.
<EOS>
You
must
allow
for
an
injure
,
angry
woman

<EOS>
but
I
will
try

command
myself
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
abuse
him

<EOS>
I
will
only
tell
you
what
I
have
find
him
.
<EOS>
fact
shall
speak
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
intimate
friend
of
my
dear
husband

who
trust
and
love
him
,
and
think
him
as
good
as
himself
.
<EOS>
the
intimacy
have
be
form
before
our
marriage
.
<EOS>
I
find
them
most
intimate
friend
;
and
I
,
too
,
become
excessively
pleased
with
Mr
Elliot
,
and
entertain
the
high
opinion
of
him
.
<EOS>
at
nineteen
,
you
know
,
one
do
not
think
very
seriously
;
but
Mr
Elliot
appear
to
me
quite
as
good
as
other
,
and
much
more
agreeable
than
most
other
,
and
we
be
almost
always
together
.
<EOS>
We
be
principally
in
town
,
live
in
very
good
style
.
<EOS>
He
be
then
the
inferior
in
circumstance
;
he
be
then
the
poor
one
;
he
have
chamber
in
the
Temple
,
and
it
be
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
support
the
appearance
of
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
have
always
a
home
with
us
whenever
he
choose
it
;
he
be
always
welcome
;
he
be
like
a
brother
.
<EOS>
My
poor
Charles
,
who
have
the
fine
,
most
generous
spirit
in
the
world
,
would
have
divide
his
last
farthing
with
him
;
and
I
know
that
his
purse
be
open
to
him
;
I
know
that
he
often
assist
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
must
have
be
about
that
very
period
of
Mr
Elliot
's
life

say
Anne
,
"
which
have
always
excite
my
particular
curiosity
.
<EOS>
It
must
have
be
about
the
same
time
that
he
become
known
to
my
father
and
sister
.
<EOS>
I
never
know
him
myself
;
I
only
hear
of
him
;
but
there
be
a
something
in
his
conduct
then
,
with
regard
to
my
father
and
sister
,
and
afterwards
in
the
circumstance
of
his
marriage
,
which
I
never
could
quite
reconcile
with
present
time
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
announce
a
different
sort
of
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
all
,
I
know
it
all
,
"
cry
Mrs
Smith
.
<EOS>
"
He
have
be
introduce
to
Sir
Walter

your
sister

I
be
acquaint

I

him
speak
of
them
for
ever

<EOS>
I
know
he
be
invite

<EOS>
I
know
he
do
not
choose
to
go
.
<EOS>
I
can
satisfy
you
,
perhaps
,
on
point
which
you
would
little
expect
;
and
as
to
his
marriage
,
I
know
all
about
it
at
the
time

<EOS>
I
be
privy
to
all
the
for
and
against
;
I
be
the
friend
to
whom
he
confide
his
hope
and
plan
;
and
though
I
do
not
know
his
wife
previously

her
inferior
situation
in
society

indeed

render
that
impossible

I
know

all
her
life

at

till
within
the
last
two

may
wish
to
put

<EOS>

Nay

"

Anne

I
have
no
particular
enquiry
to
make
about
her

<EOS>
I
have
always
understand
they
be
not
a
happy
couple
.
<EOS>
but
I
should
like
to
know
why
,
at
that
time
of
his
life

he
should
slight
my
father
's
acquaintance
as
he
do

<EOS>
My
father
be
certainly
disposed
to
take
very
kind
and
proper
notice
of
him

why
do
Mr
Elliot
draw
back
?

Mr

reply
Mrs
Smith

"
at
that
period
of
his
life

have
one
object
in
view
:
to
make
his
fortune

by
a
rather
quick
process
than
the
law
.
<EOS>
He
be
determined
to
make
it
by
marriage

<EOS>
He
be
determine
,
at
least
,
not
to
mar
it
by
an
imprudent
marriage
;
and
I
know
it
be
his
belief
(
whether
justly
or
not
,
of
course
I
can
not
decide
)
,
that
your
father
and
sister
,
in
their
civility

invitation
,
be
design
a
match
between
the
heir
and
the
young
lady

it
be
impossible
that
such
a
match
should
have
answer
his
idea
of
wealth
and
independence
.
<EOS>
that
be
his
motive
for
draw
back
,
I
can
assure
you
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
the
whole
story

<EOS>
He
have
no
concealment
with
me

<EOS>
It
be
curious

that
have
just
leave
you
behind
me
in
Bath
,
my
first
and
principal
acquaintance
on
marry
should
be
your
cousin

that
,
through
him

I
should
be
continually

of

He
describe
one

it

what
wild

one

how
sure

I
beg
your
pardon
;
I
have
interrupt
you

<EOS>
Mr

marry
then
completely
for
money
?

the
circumstance
,
probably
,
which
first
open
your
eye

Mrs

hesitate
a
little
here

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
those
thing
be
too
common

<EOS>
when
one
live
in
the
world
,
a
man
or
woman
's
marry
for
money
be
too
common
to
strike
one
as
it
ought

<EOS>
I
be
very
young

associate
only
with
the
young

and
we
be
a
thoughtless

gay
set
,
without
any
strict
rule
of
conduct
.
<EOS>
We
live
for
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
I
think
differently
now
;
time
and
sickness
and
sorrow
have
give
me
other
notion
;
but
at
that
period
I
must
own
<EOS>
I
see
nothing
reprehensible
in
what
Mr

be
do
.

"
to
do
the
good
for
himself

pass
as
a
duty

<EOS>

be
not
she
a
very
low
woman
?

"
<EOS>
yes
;
which
I
object
to
,

he
would
not
regard

money
,
money
,
be
all
that
he

yes

I

I
will
shew
him
as

I

His

my

no

It
do
not

two

nothing
of
consequence

the

be

good

the

it
collect

<EOS>
Mr

talk
unreservedly
to
Colonel
Wallis
of
his
view
on
you

which
say
Colonel
Wallis
,
I
imagine
to
be
,
in
himself
,
a
sensible

careful
,
discern
sort
of
character
;
but
Colonel
Wallis
have
a
very
pretty
silly
wife

he
tell
thing

he
have
well
not

in

repeat
it
all

know
my

bring
it
all
to
me

on
Monday
evening

my

let
me
thus
much
into
the
secret
of
Marlborough
Buildings

when
I
talk
of

you
see
I
be

so
much

My

Mrs

this
will
not
do

<EOS>
Mr

have
any

be
all

them
on

I
arrive

I
know
you
do

I

it
all
perfectly

"
  
"
indeed
,
Mrs

,
we
must
not
expect
to
get
real
information
in
such
a
line

<EOS>
fact
or
opinion
which
be
to
pass
through
the
hand

so
many
,
to
be
misconceive

folly

can
hardly
have
much
truth
leave

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

only
give
me
a
hearing

<EOS>
You
will
soon
be
able
to
judge
of
the
general
credit
due
,
by
listen
to
some
particular
which
you
can
yourself
immediately
contradict
or
confirm
.
<EOS>
nobody
suppose
that
you
be
his
first
inducement

<EOS>
He
have
see
you
indeed
,
before
he
come
to
Bath
,
and
admire
you

without
know
it
to
be
you

so
say
my
historian

at

be
this
true

do
he
see

use

own
word

certainly
do

it

<EOS>
"
well

triumphantly
,
"
grant
my
friend
the
credit
due
to
the
establishment
of
the
first
point
assert
.
<EOS>
He
see
you
then
at
Lyme
,
and
like
you
so
well
as
to
be
exceedingly
pleased
to
meet
with
you
again
in
Camden
Place
,
as
Miss
Anne
Elliot
,
and
from
that
moment
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
have
a
double
motive
in
his
visit
there
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
another
,
and
an
earlier
,
which
I
will
now
explain
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
anything
in
my
story
which
you
know
to
be
either
false
or
improbable
,
stop
me
.
<EOS>
My
account
state
,
that
your
sister
's
friend
,
the
lady
now
stay
with
you
,
whom
I
have
hear
you
mention
,
come
to
Bath
with
Miss
Elliot
and
Sir
Walter
as
long
ago
as
September
(
in
short
when
they
first
come
themselves
)
,
and
have
be
stay
there
ever
since
;
that
she
be
a
clever
,
insinuating
,
handsome
woman
,
poor
and
plausible
,
and
altogether
such
in
situation
and
manner
,
as
to
give
a
general
idea
,
among
Sir
Walter
's
acquaintance
,
of
her
meaning
to
be
Lady
Elliot
,
and
as
general
a
surprise
that
Miss
Elliot
should
be
apparently
,
blind
to
the
danger
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
Mrs
Smith
pause
a
moment
;
but
Anne
have
not
a
word
to
say
,
and
she
continue
    
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
light
in
which
it
appear
to
those
who
know
the
family
,
long
before
you
return
to
it
;
and
Colonel
Wallis
have
his
eye
upon
your
father
enough
to
be
sensible
of
it
,
though
he
do
not
then
visit
in
Camden
Place
;
but
his
regard
for
Mr
Elliot
give
him
an
interest
in
watch
all
that
be
go
on
there
,
and
when
Mr
Elliot
come
to
Bath
for
a
day
or
two
,
as
he
happen
to
do
a
little
before
Christmas
,
Colonel
Wallis
make
him
acquaint
with
the
appearance
of
thing
,
and
the
report
begin
to
prevail
.
<EOS>
now
you
be
to
understand
,
that
time
have
work
a
very
material
change
in
Mr
Elliot
's
opinion
as
to
the
value
of
a
baronetcy
.
<EOS>
upon
all
point
of
blood
and
connexion
he
be
a
completely
alter
man
.
<EOS>
have
long
have
as
much
money
as
he
could
spend
,
nothing
to
wish
for
on
the
side
of
avarice
or
indulgence
,
he
have
be
gradually
learn
to
pin
his
happiness
upon
the
consequence
he
be
heir
to
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
come
on
before
our
acquaintance
cease
,
but
it
be
now
a
confirm
feeling
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
bear
the
idea
of
not
be
Sir
William
.
<EOS>
You
may
guess
,
therefore
,
that
the
news
he
hear
from
his
friend
could
not
be
very
agreeable
,
and
you
may
guess
what
it
produce
;
the
resolution
of
come
back
to
Bath
as
soon
as
possible
,
and
of
fix
himself
here
for
a
time
,
with
the
view
of
renew
his
former
acquaintance
,
and
recover
such
a
footing
in
the
family
as
may
give
him
the
mean
of
ascertain
the
degree
of
his
danger
,
and
of
circumvent
the
lady
if
he
find
it
material
.
<EOS>
this
be
agree
upon
between
the
two
friend
as
the
only
thing
to
be
do
;
and
Colonel
Wallis
be
to
assist
in
every
way
that
he
could
.
<EOS>
He
be
to
be
introduce
,
and
Mrs
Wallis
be
to
be
introduce
,
and
everybody
be
to
be
introduce
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
come
back
accordingly
;
and
on
application
be
forgive
,
as
you
know
,
and
re
-
admit
into
the
family
;
and
there
it
be
his
constant
object
,
and
his
only
object
(
till
your
arrival
add
another
motive
)
,
to
watch
Sir
Walter
and
Mrs
Clay
.
<EOS>
He
omit
no
opportunity
of
be
with
them
,
throw
himself
in
their
way
,
call
at
all
hour
;
but
I
need
not
be
particular
on
this
subject
.
<EOS>
You
can
imagine
what
an
artful
man
would
do
;
and
with
this
guide
,
perhaps
,
may
recollect
what
you
have
see
him
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Anne
,
"
you
tell
me
nothing
which
do
not
accord
with
what
I
have
know

could
imagine

<EOS>
there
be
always
something
offensive
in
the
detail

cunne

<EOS>
the
manoeuvre
of
selfishness
and
duplicity
must
ever
be
revolt
,

I
have
hear
nothing
which
really
surprise
me

<EOS>
I
know
those
who
would
be
shock
by
such
a
representation
of
Mr
Elliot
,
who
would
have
difficulty
in
believe
it
;
but
I
have
never
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
want
some
other
motive
for
his
conduct
than
appear
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
know
his
present
opinion
,
as
to
the
probability
of
the
event
he
have
be
in
dread
of
;
whether
he
consider
the
danger
to
be
lessen
or
not

<EOS>
"
Lessening
,
I
understand
,
"
reply
Mrs
Smith

<EOS>
He
think
Mrs
Clay
afraid
of
him
,
aware
that
he
see
through
her
,
and
not
dare
to
proceed
as
she
may
do
in
his
absence
.
<EOS>
but
since
he
must
be
absent
some
time
or
other
,
I
do
not
perceive
how
he
can
ever
be
secure
while
she
hold
her
present
influence
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Wallis
have
an
amusing
idea
,
as
nurse
tell
me
,
that
it
be
to
be
put
into
the
marriage
article
when
you
and
Mr
Elliot
marry
,
that
your
father
be
not
to
marry
Mrs
Clay
.
<EOS>
a
scheme
,
worthy
of
Mrs
Wallis
's
understanding
,
by
all
account
;
but
my
sensible
nurse
Rooke
see
the
absurdity
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
to
be
sure
,
madam
,
"
say
she
,
"
it
would
not
prevent
his
marry
anybody
else
.
"
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
to
own
the
truth
,
I
do
not
think
nurse
,
in
her
heart
,
be
a
very
strenuous
opposer
of
Sir
Walter
's
make
a
second
match
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
allow
to
be
a
favourer
of
matrimony
,
you
know
;
and
(
since
self
will
intrude
)
who
can
say
that
she
may
not
have
some
fly
vision
of
attend
the
next
Lady
Elliot
,
through
Mrs
Wallis
's
recommendation
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
to
know
all
this
,
"
say
Anne
,
after
a
little
thoughtfulness
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
more
painful
to
me
in
some
respect
to
be
in
company
with
him
,
but
I
shall
know
better
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
My
line
of
conduct
will
be
more
direct
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
be
evidently
a
disingenuous
,
artificial
,
worldly
man
,
who
have
never
have
any
well
principle
to
guide
him
than
selfishness
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
Mr
Elliot
be
not
do
with
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Smith
have
be
carry
away
from
her
first
direction
,
and
Anne
have
forget
,
in
the
interest
of
her
own
family
concern
,
how
much
have
be
originally
imply
against
him
;
but
her
attention
be
now
call
to
the
explanation
of
those
first
hint
,
and
she
listen
to
a
recital
which
,
if
it
do
not
perfectly
justify
the
unqualified
bitterness
of
Mrs
Smith
,
prove
him
to
have
be
very
unfeeling
in
his
conduct
towards
her
;
very
deficient
both
in
justice
and
compassion
.
  
<EOS>
She
learn
that
(
the
intimacy
between
them
continue
unimpaired
by
Mr
Elliot
's
marriage
)
they
have
be
as
before
always
together
,
and
Mr
Elliot
have
lead
his
friend
into
expense
much
beyond
his
fortune
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Smith
do
not
want
to
take
blame
to
herself
,
and
be
most
tender
of
throw
any
on
her
husband
;
but
Anne
could
collect
that
their
income
have
never
be
equal
to
their
style
of
living
,
and
that
from
the
first
there
have
be
a
great
deal
of
general
and
joint
extravagance
.
<EOS>
from
his
wife
's
account
of
him
she
could
discern
Mr
Smith
to
have
be
a
man
of
warm
feeling
,
easy
temper
,
careless
habit
,
and
not
strong
understanding
,
much
more
amiable
than
his
friend
,
and
very
unlike
him
,
lead
by
him
,
and
probably
despise
by
him
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
,
raise
by
his
marriage
to
great
affluence
,
and
dispose
to
every
gratification
of
pleasure
and
vanity
which
could
be
command
without
involve
himself
,
(
for
with
all
his
self
-
indulgence
he
have
become
a
prudent
man
)
,
and
begin
to
be
rich
,
just
as
his
friend
ought
to
have
find
himself
to
be
poor
,
seem
to
have
have
no
concern
at
all
for
that
friend
's
probable
finance
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
have
be
prompt
and
encouraging
expense
which
could
end
only
in
ruin
;
and
the
Smiths
accordingly
have
be
ruin
.
  
<EOS>
the
husband
have
die
just
in
time
to
be
spare
the
full
knowledge
of
it
.
<EOS>
They
have
previously
know
embarrassment
enough
to
try
the
friendship
of
their
friend
,
and
to
prove
that
Mr
Elliot
's
have
well
not
be
try
;
but
it
be
not
till
his
death
that
the
wretched
state
of
his
affair
be
fully
know
.
<EOS>
with
a
confidence
in
Mr
Elliot
's
regard
,
more
creditable
to
his
feeling
than
his
judgement
,
Mr
Smith
have
appoint
him
the
executor
of
his
will
;
but
Mr
Elliot
would
not
act
,
and
the
difficulty
and
distress
which
this
refusal
have
heap
on
her
,
in
addition
to
the
inevitable
suffering
of
her
situation
,
have
be
such
as
could
not
be
relate
without
anguish
of
spirit
,
or
listen
to
without
correspond
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
be
shew
some
letter
of
his
on
the
occasion
,
answer
to
urgent
application
from
Mrs
Smith
,
which
all
breathe
the
same
stern
resolution
of
not
engage
in
a
fruitless
trouble
,
and
,
under
a
cold
civility
,
the
same
hard
-
hearted
indifference
to
any
of
the
evil
it
may
bring
on
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
dreadful
picture
of
ingratitude
and
inhumanity
;
and
Anne
feel
,
at
some
moment
,
that
no
flagrant
open
crime
could
have
be
bad
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
great
deal
to
listen
to
;
all
the
particular
of
past
sad
scene
,
all
the
minutia
of
distress
upon
distress
,
which
in
former
conversation
have
be
merely
hint
at
,
be
dwell
on
now
with
a
natural
indulgence
.
<EOS>
Anne
could
perfectly
comprehend
the
exquisite
relief
,
and
be
only
the
more
inclined
to
wonder
at
the
composure
of
her
friend
's
usual
state
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
one
circumstance
in
the
history
of
her
grievance
of
particular
irritation
.
<EOS>
She
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
some
property
of
her
husband
in
the
West
Indies
,
which
have
be
for
many
year
under
a
sort
of
sequestration
for
the
payment
of
its
own
incumbrance
,
may
be
recoverable
by
proper
measure
;
and
this
property
,
though
not
large
,
would
be
enough
to
make
her
comparatively
rich
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
nobody
to
stir
in
it
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
would
do
nothing
,
and
she
could
do
nothing
herself
,
equally
disabled
from
personal
exertion
by
her
state
of
bodily
weakness
,
and
from
employ
other
by
her
want
of
money
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
natural
connexion
to
assist
her
even
with
their
counsel
,
and
she
could
not
afford
to
purchase
the
assistance
of
the
law
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
cruel
aggravation
of
actually
straiten
mean
.
<EOS>
to
feel
that
she
ought
to
be
in
well
circumstance
,
that
a
little
trouble
in
the
right
place
may
do
it
,
and
to
fear
that
delay
may
be
even
weaken
her
claim
,
be
hard
to
bear
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
on
this
point
that
she
have
hope
to
engage
Anne
's
good
office
with
Mr
Elliot
.
<EOS>
She
have
previously
,
in
the
anticipation
of
their
marriage
,
be
very
apprehensive
of
lose
her
friend
by
it
;
but
on
be
assure
that
he
could
have
make
no
attempt
of
that
nature
,
since
he
do
not
even
know
her
to
be
in
Bath
,
it
immediately
occur
,
that
something
may
be
do
in
her
favour
by
the
influence
of
the
woman
he
love
,
and
she
have
be
hastily
prepare
to
interest
Anne
's
feeling
,
as
far
as
the
observance
due
to
Mr
Elliot
's
character
would
allow
,
when
Anne
's
refutation
of
the
suppose
engagement
change
the
face
of
everything
;
and
while
it
take
from
her
the
new
-
form
hope
of
succeed
in
the
object
of
her
first
anxiety
,
leave
her
at
least
the
comfort
of
tell
the
whole
story
her
own
way
.
  
<EOS>
after
listen
to
this
full
description
of
Mr
Elliot
,
Anne
could
not
but
express
some
surprise
at
Mrs
Smith
's
have
speak
of
him
so
favourably
in
the
beginning
of
their
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
She
have
seem
to
recommend
and
praise
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
be
Mrs
Smith
's
reply
,
"
there
be
nothing
else
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
I
consider
your
marry
him
as
certain
,
though
he
may
not
yet
have
make
the
offer
,
and
I
could
no
more
speak
the
truth
of
him
,
than
if
he
have
be
your
husband
.
<EOS>
My
heart
bleed
for
you
,
as
I
talk
of
happiness
;
and
yet
he
be
sensible
,
he
be
agreeable
,
and
with
such
a
woman
as
you
,
it
be
not
absolutely
hopeless
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
unkind
to
his
first
wife
.
<EOS>
They
be
wretched
together
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
too
ignorant
and
giddy
for
respect
,
and
he
have
never
love
her
.
<EOS>
I
be
willing
to
hope
that
you
must
fare
better
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
could
just
acknowledge
within
herself
such
a
possibility
of
have
be
induce
to
marry
him
,
as
make
her
shudder
at
the
idea
of
the
misery
which
must
have
follow
.
<EOS>
It
be
just
possible
that
she
may
have
be
persuade
by
Lady
Russell
!
<EOS>
and
under
such
a
supposition
,
which
would
have
be
most
miserable
,
when
time
have
disclose
all
,
too
late
?
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
desirable
that
Lady
Russell
should
be
no
longer
deceive
;
and
one
of
the
conclude
arrangement
of
this
important
conference
,
which
carry
them
through
the
great
part
of
the
morning
,
be
,
that
Anne
have
full
liberty
to
communicate
to
her
friend
everything
relative
to
Mrs
Smith
,
in
which
his
conduct
be
involve
.
    
<EOS>
Anne
go
home
to
think
over
all
that
she
have
hear
.
<EOS>
in
one
point
,
her
feeling
be
relieve
by
this
knowledge
of
Mr
Elliot
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
longer
anything
of
tenderness
due
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
stand
as
oppose
to
Captain
Wentworth
,
in
all
his
own
unwelcome
obtrusiveness
;
and
the
evil
of
his
attention
last
night
,
the
irremediable
mischief
he
may
have
do
,
be
consider
with
sensation
unqualified
,
unperplexed
.
<EOS>
pity
for
him
be
all
over
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
the
only
point
of
relief
.
<EOS>
in
every
other
respect
,
in
look
around
her
,
or
penetrate
forward
,
she
see
more
to
distrust
and
to
apprehend
.
<EOS>
She
be
concern
for
the
disappointment
and
pain
Lady
Russell
would
be
feel
;
for
the
mortification
which
must
be
hang
over
her
father
and
sister
,
and
have
all
the
distress
of
foresee
many
evil
,
without
know
how
to
avert
any
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
She
be
most
thankful
for
her
own
knowledge
of
him
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
consider
herself
as
entitle
to
reward
for
not
slight
an
old
friend
like
Mrs
Smith
,
but
here
be
a
reward
indeed
spring
from
it
!
<EOS>
Mrs
Smith
have
be
able
to
tell
her
what
no
one
else
could
have
do
.
<EOS>
Could
the
knowledge
have
be
extend
through
her
family
?
<EOS>
but
this
be
a
vain
idea
.
<EOS>
She
must
talk
to
Lady
Russell
,
tell
her
,
consult
with
her
,
and
have
do
her
good
,
wait
the
event
with
as
much
composure
as
possible
;
and
after
all
,
her
great
want
of
composure
would
be
in
that
quarter
of
the
mind
which
could
not
be
open
to
Lady
Russell
;
in
that
flow
of
anxiety
and
fear
which
must
be
all
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
She
find
,
on
reach
home
,
that
she
have
,
as
she
intend
,
escape
see
Mr
Elliot
;
that
he
have
call
and
pay
them
a
long
morning
visit
;
but
hardly
have
she
congratulate
herself
,
and
feel
safe
,
when
she
hear
that
he
be
come
again
in
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
small
intention
of
ask
him
,
"
say
Elizabeth
,
with
affected
carelessness
,
"
but
he
give
so
many
hint
;
so
<EOS>
Mrs
Clay
say
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
I
do
say
it
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
anybody
in
my
life
spell
harder
for
an
invitation
.
<EOS>
poor
man
!
<EOS>
I
be
really
in
pain
for
him
;
for
your
hard
-
hearted
sister
,
Miss
Anne
,
seem
bent
on
cruelty
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
"
cry
Elizabeth
,
"
I
have
be
rather
too
much
use
to
the
game
to
be
soon
overcome
by
a
gentleman
's
hint
.
<EOS>
however
,
when
I
find
how
excessively
he
be
regret
that
he
should
miss
my
father
this
morning
,
I
give
way
immediately
,
for
I
would
never
really
omit
an
opportunity
of
bring
him
and
Sir
Walter
together
.
<EOS>
They
appear
to
so
much
advantage
in
company
with
each
other
.
<EOS>
each
behaving
so
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
look
up
with
so
much
respect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
quite
delightful
!
"
cry
Mrs
Clay
,
not
daring
,
however
,
to
turn
her
eye
towards
Anne
.
"
<EOS>
exactly
like
father
and
son
!
<EOS>
Dear
Miss
Elliot
,
may
I
not
say
father
and
son
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
I
lay
no
embargo
on
any
body
's
word
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
have
such
idea
!
<EOS>
but
,
upon
my
word
,
I
be
scarcely
sensible
of
his
attention
be
beyond
those
of
other
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Miss
Elliot
!
"
exclaim
Mrs
Clay
,
lift
her
hand
and
eye
,
and
sink
all
the
rest
of
her
astonishment
in
a
convenient
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
penelope
,
you
need
not
be
so
alarmed
about
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
invite
him
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
send
him
away
with
smile
.
<EOS>
when
I
find
he
be
really
go
to
his
friend
at
Thornberry
Park
for
the
whole
day
to
-
morrow
,
I
have
compassion
on
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
admire
the
good
acting
of
the
friend
,
in
be
able
to
shew
such
pleasure
as
she
do
,
in
the
expectation
and
in
the
actual
arrival
of
the
very
person
whose
presence
must
really
be
interfere
with
her
prime
object
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
but
that
Mrs
Clay
must
hate
the
sight
of
Mr
Elliot
;
and
yet
she
could
assume
a
most
obliging
,
placid
look
,
and
appear
quite
satisfied
with
the
curtail
license
of
devote
herself
only
half
as
much
to
Sir
Walter
as
she
would
have
do
otherwise
.
  
<EOS>
to
Anne
herself
it
be
most
distressing
to
see
Mr
Elliot
enter
the
room
;
and
quite
painful
to
have
him
approach
and
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
use
before
to
feel
that
he
could
not
be
always
quite
sincere
,
but
now
she
see
insincerity
in
everything
.
<EOS>
His
attentive
deference
to
her
father
,
contrast
with
his
former
language
,
be
odious
;
and
when
she
think
of
his
cruel
conduct
towards
Mrs
Smith
,
she
could
hardly
bear
the
sight
of
his
present
smile
and
mildness
,
or
the
sound
of
his
artificial
good
sentiment
.
  
<EOS>
She
mean
to
avoid
any
such
alteration
of
manner
as
may
provoke
a
remonstrance
on
his
side
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
object
to
her
to
escape
all
enquiry
or
eclat
;
but
it
be
her
intention
to
be
as
decidedly
cool
to
him
as
may
be
compatible
with
their
relationship
;
and
to
retrace
,
as
quietly
as
she
could
,
the
few
step
of
unnecessary
intimacy
she
have
be
gradually
lead
along
.
<EOS>
She
be
accordingly
more
guarded
,
and
more
cool
,
than
she
have
be
the
night
before
.
  
<EOS>
He
want
to
animate
her
curiosity
again
as
to
how
and
where
he
could
have
hear
her
formerly
praise
;
want
very
much
to
be
gratify
by
more
solicitation
;
but
the
charm
be
break
:
he
find
that
the
heat
and
animation
of
a
public
room
be
necessary
to
kindle
his
modest
cousin
's
vanity
;
he
find
,
at
least
,
that
it
be
not
to
be
do
now
,
by
any
of
those
attempt
which
he
could
hazard
among
the
too
-
command
claim
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
He
little
surmise
that
it
be
a
subject
act
now
exactly
against
his
interest
,
bring
immediately
to
her
thought
all
those
part
of
his
conduct
which
be
least
excusable
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
some
satisfaction
in
find
that
he
be
really
go
out
of
Bath
the
next
morning
,
go
early
,
and
that
he
would
be
go
the
great
part
of
two
day
.
<EOS>
He
be
invite
again
to
Camden
Place
the
very
evening
of
his
return
;
but
from
Thursday
to
Saturday
evening
his
absence
be
certain
.
<EOS>
It
be
bad
enough
that
a
Mrs
Clay
should
be
always
before
her
;
but
that
a
deep
hypocrite
should
be
add
to
their
party
,
seem
the
destruction
of
everything
like
peace
and
comfort
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
humiliating
to
reflect
on
the
constant
deception
practise
on
her
father
and
Elizabeth
;
to
consider
the
various
source
of
mortification
prepare
for
them
!
<EOS>
Mrs
Clay
's
selfishness
be
not
so
complicate
nor
so
revolt
as
his
;
and
Anne
would
have
compound
for
the
marriage
at
once
,
with
all
its
evil
,
to
be
clear
of
Mr
Elliot
's
subtlety
in
endeavour
to
prevent
it
.
  
<EOS>
on
Friday
morning
she
mean
to
go
very
early
to
Lady
Russell
,
and
accomplish
the
necessary
communication
;
and
she
would
have
go
directly
after
breakfast
,
but
that
Mrs
Clay
be
also
go
out
on
some
obliging
purpose
of
save
her
sister
trouble
,
which
determine
her
to
wait
till
she
may
be
safe
from
such
a
companion
.
<EOS>
She
see
Mrs
Clay
fairly
off
,
therefore
,
before
she
begin
to
talk
of
spend
the
morning
in
Rivers
Street
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
say
Elizabeth
,
"
I
have
nothing
to
send
but
my
love
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
you
may
as
well
take
back
that
tiresome
book
she
would
lend
me
,
and
pretend
I
have
read
it
through
.
<EOS>
I
really
can
not
be
plague
myself
for
ever
with
all
the
new
poem
and
state
of
the
nation
that
come
out
.
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
quite
bore
one
with
her
new
publication
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
tell
her
so
,
but
I
think
her
dress
hideous
the
other
night
.
<EOS>
I
use
to
think
she
have
some
taste
in
dress
,
but
I
be
ashamed
of
her
at
the
concert
.
<EOS>
something
so
formal
and
arrange
in
her
air
!
<EOS>
and
she
sit
so
upright
!
<EOS>
My
good
love
,
of
course
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
mine
,
"
add
Sir
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
Kindest
regard
.
<EOS>
and
you
may
say
,
that
I
mean
to
call
upon
her
soon
.
<EOS>
make
a
civil
message
;
but
I
shall
only
leave
my
card
.
<EOS>
morning
visit
be
never
fair
by
woman
at
her
time
of
life
,
who
make
themselves
up
so
little
.
<EOS>
if
she
would
only
wear
rouge
she
would
not
be
afraid
of
be
see
;
but
last
time
I
call
<EOS>
,
I
observe
the
blind
be
let
down
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
while
her
father
speak
,
there
be
a
knock
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
who
could
it
be
?
<EOS>
Anne
,
remember
the
preconcerte
visit
,
at
all
hour
,
of
Mr
Elliot
,
would
have
expect
him
,
but
for
his
know
engagement
seven
mile
off
.
<EOS>
after
the
usual
period
of
suspense
,
the
usual
sound
of
approach
be
hear
,
and
"
Mr
and
Mrs
Charles
Musgrove
"
be
usher
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Surprise
be
the
strong
emotion
raise
by
their
appearance
;
but
Anne
be
really
glad
to
see
them
;
and
the
other
be
not
so
sorry
but
that
they
could
put
on
a
decent
air
of
welcome
;
and
as
soon
as
it
become
clear
that
these
,
their
near
relation
,
be
not
arrive
with
any
view
of
accommodation
in
that
house
,
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
be
able
to
rise
in
cordiality
,
and
do
the
honour
of
it
very
well
.
<EOS>
They
be
come
to
Bath
for
a
few
day
with
Mrs
Musgrove
,
and
be
at
the
White
Hart
.
<EOS>
so
much
be
pretty
soon
understand
;
but
till
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
be
walk
Mary
into
the
other
drawing
-
room
,
and
regale
themselves
with
her
admiration
,
Anne
could
not
draw
upon
Charles
's
brain
for
a
regular
history
of
their
come
,
or
an
explanation
of
some
smile
hint
of
particular
business
,
which
have
be
ostentatiously
drop
by
Mary
,
as
well
as
of
some
apparent
confusion
as
to
whom
their
party
consist
of
.
  
<EOS>
She
then
find
that
it
consist
of
Mrs
Musgrove
,
Henrietta
,
and
Captain
Harville
,
beside
their
two
self
.
<EOS>
He
give
her
a
very
plain
,
intelligible
account
of
the
whole
;
a
narration
in
which
she
see
a
great
deal
of
most
characteristic
proceeding
.
<EOS>
the
scheme
have
receive
its
first
impulse
by
Captain
Harville
's
want
to
come
to
Bath
on
business
.
<EOS>
He
have
begin
to
talk
of
it
a
week
ago
;
and
by
way
of
do
something
,
as
shooting
be
over
,
Charles
have
propose
come
with
him
,
and
Mrs
Harville
have
seem
to
like
the
idea
of
it
very
much
,
as
an
advantage
to
her
husband
;
but
Mary
could
not
bear
to
be
leave
,
and
have
make
herself
so
unhappy
about
it
,
that
for
a
day
or
two
everything
seem
to
be
in
suspense
,
or
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
it
have
be
take
up
by
his
father
and
mother
.
<EOS>
His
mother
have
some
old
friend
in
Bath
whom
she
want
to
see
;
it
be
think
a
good
opportunity
for
Henrietta
to
come
and
buy
wedding
-
clothe
for
herself
and
her
sister
;
and
,
in
short
,
it
end
in
be
his
mother
's
party
,
that
everything
may
be
comfortable
and
easy
to
Captain
Harville
;
and
he
and
Mary
be
include
in
it
by
way
of
general
convenience
.
<EOS>
They
have
arrive
late
the
night
before
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Harville
,
her
child
,
and
Captain
Benwick
,
remain
with
Mr
Musgrove
and
Louisa
at
Uppercross
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
's
only
surprise
be
,
that
affair
should
be
in
forwardness
enough
for
Henrietta
's
wedding
-
clothe
to
be
talk
of
.
<EOS>
She
have
imagine
such
difficulty
of
fortune
to
exist
there
as
must
prevent
the
marriage
from
be
near
at
hand
;
but
she
learn
from
Charles
that
,
very
recently
,
(
since
Mary
's
last
letter
to
herself
)
,
Charles
Hayter
have
be
apply
to
by
a
friend
to
hold
a
living
for
a
youth
who
could
not
possibly
claim
it
under
many
year
;
and
that
on
the
strength
of
his
present
income
,
with
almost
a
certainty
of
something
more
permanent
long
before
the
term
in
question
,
the
two
family
have
consent
to
the
young
people
's
wish
,
and
that
their
marriage
be
likely
to
take
place
in
a
few
month
,
quite
as
soon
as
Louisa
's
.
"
and
a
very
good
live
it
be
,
"
Charles
add
:
"
only
five
-
and
-
twenty
mile
from
Uppercross

and
in
a
very
fine
country
:
fine
part
of

the
good

in
the
kingdom

surround
by
three
great
proprietor

each
more
careful
and
jealous
than
the
other
;
and
to
two
of
the
three
at
least
,
Charles
Hayter
may
get
a
special
recommendation
.
<EOS>
not
that
he
will
value
it
as
he
ought
,
"
he
observe
,
"
Charles
be
too
cool
about
sport

<EOS>
that
be
the
bad
of
him

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
extremely
glad

indeed

cry
Anne

"
particularly
glad
that
this
should
happen

and
that
of
two

who
both
deserve
equally
well

and
who
have
always
be
such
good
friend

the
pleasant
prospect

one
should
not

dim

of
the

that
they
should
be
so
equal
in
their

I

your

<EOS>
yes

My

be
well
pleased

agreeable

<EOS>
however
,
I
do
not

they
have
not

<EOS>
It
be
very
fit
they
should
have

I
be
sure
he
have
always
be
a
very
kind

liberal
father

me

Mary
do
not

She
never

but
she
do
not
do
him
justice

nor
think
enough
about
Winthrop

<EOS>
I
can
not
make
her
attend

the

<EOS>
It
be
a
very
fair

as
time

I
have

I
shall
not

off

such

<EOS>
what
a
blessing
to
young
people
to

<EOS>
Your

seem
so
totally
free
from
all
those
ambitious
feeling

have
lead
to
so
much
misconduct

she
start

that
can

illiberal

<EOS>
I

he
have
plenty

His

I

more
acquainted

I
do
before

We
have
a
famous
set

to
at
rat

hunt
<EOS>
all
the
morning
in
my
father

great
barn

he
play
his

so
well

I
have
like
him
the
better
ever
since

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
they
be
interrupt
by
the
absolute
necessity
of
Charles

follow
the
other
to
admire
mirrors
and
china
;
but
Anne
have
hear
enough
to
understand
the
present
state
of
Uppercross
,
and
rejoice
in
its
happiness
;
and
though
she
sigh
as
she
rejoice
,
her
sigh
have
none
of
the
ill
-
will
of
envy
in
it

<EOS>
She
would
certainly
have
rise
to
their
blessing
if
she
could

but
she
do
not
want
to
lessen
theirs
.
  
<EOS>
the
visit
pass
off
altogether
in
high
good
humour
.
<EOS>
Mary
be
in
excellent
spirit
,
enjoy
the
gaiety
and
the
change
,
and
so
well
satisfied
with
the
journey
in
her
mother
-
in
-
law
's
carriage
with
four
horse
,
and
with
her
own
complete
independence
of
Camden
Place
,
that
she
be
exactly
in
a
temper
to
admire
everything
as
she
ought
,
and
enter
most
readily
into
all
the
superiority
of
the
house
,
as
they
be
detail
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
demand
on
her
father
or
sister
,
and
her
consequence
be
just
enough
increase
by
their
handsome
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
,
for
a
short
time
,
suffer
a
good
deal
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
Mrs
Musgrove
and
all
her
party
ought
to
be
ask
to
dine
with
them
;
but
she
could
not
bear
to
have
the
difference
of
style
,
the
reduction
of
servant
,
which
a
dinner
must
betray
,
witness
by
those
who
have
be
always
so
inferior
to
the
Elliots
of
Kellynch
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
struggle
between
propriety
and
vanity
;
but
vanity
get
the
well
,
and
then
Elizabeth
be
happy
again
.
<EOS>
these
be
her
internal
persuasion
:
"
old
fashioned
notion
;
country
hospitality
;
we
do
not
profess
to
give
dinner
;
few
people
in
Bath
do
;
Lady
Alicia
never
do
;
do
not
even
ask
her
own
sister
's
family
,
though
they
be
here
a
month
:
<EOS>
and
I
dare
say
it
would
be
very
inconvenient
to
Mrs
Musgrove
;
put
her
quite
out
of
her
way
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
she
would
rather
not
come
;
she
can
not
feel
easy
with
us
.
<EOS>
I
will
ask
them
all
for
an
evening
;
that
will
be
much
well
;
that
will
be
a
novelty
and
a
treat
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
see
two
such
drawing
room
before
.
<EOS>
They
will
be
delighted
to
come
to
-
morrow
evening
.
<EOS>
It
shall
be
a
regular
party
,
small
,
but
most
elegant
.
"
<EOS>
and
this
satisfied
Elizabeth
:
<EOS>
and
when
the
invitation
be
give
to
the
two
present
,
and
promise
for
the
absent
,
Mary
be
as
completely

Her

of

must
give
way
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
They
all
three
call
in
Rivers
Street
for
a
couple
of
minute
;
but
Anne
convince
herself
that
a
day
's
delay
of
the
intended
communication
could
be
of
no
consequence
,
and
hasten
forward
to
the
White
Hart
,
to

the

with
an

They

and
Mrs
Musgrove
's
real
affection
have
be
win
by
her
usefulness
when
they
be
in
distress

<EOS>
It
be
a
heartiness
,
and
a
warmth
,
and
a
sincerity
which
Anne
delight
in
the
more
,
from
the
sad
want
of
such
blessing
at
home

<EOS>
She

of
her
time
as
possible
,

for
every
day
and
all
day

,
or
rather
claim
as
part
of
the
family
;
and
,
in
return
,
she
naturally
fall
into
all
her
wonted
way
of
attention
and
assistance
,
and
on
Charles
's
leave
them
together
,
be

and
to
Henrietta

with

from

;
from

,
to
try
to

that

be
not

which
Mary

well

as
she
generally
be
,
in
her
station
at
a
window
overlook
the
entrance
to
the
Pump
Room
,
<EOS>
could
not
but
have
her
moment
of
imagine
.
  
<EOS>
a
morning
of
thorough
confusion
be
to
be
expect
.
<EOS>
a
large
party
in
an
hotel
ensure
a
quick
-
change
,
unsettled
scene
.
<EOS>
one
five
minute
bring
a
note
,
the
next
a
parcel
;
and
Anne
have
not
be
there
half
an
hour
,
when
their
dining
-
room
,
spacious
as
it
be
,
seem
more
than
half
fill
:
a
party
of
steady
old
friend
be
seat
around
Mrs
Musgrove
,
and
Charles
come
back
with
Captains
Harville
and
Wentworth
.
<EOS>
the
appearance
of
the
latter
could
not
be
more
than
the
surprise
of
the
moment
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
her
to
have
forget
to
feel
that
this
arrival
of
their
common
friend
must
be
soon
bring
them
together
again
.
<EOS>
Their
last
meeting
have
be
most
important
in
open
his
feeling
;
she
have
derive
from
it
a
delightful
conviction
;
but
she
fear
from
his
look
,
that
the
same
unfortunate
persuasion
,
which
have
hasten
him
away
from
the
Concert
Room
,
still
govern
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
seem
to
want
to
be
near
enough
for
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
She
try
to
be
calm
,
and
leave
thing
to
take
their
course
,
and
try
to
dwell
much
on
this
argument
of
rational
dependence
:
 
"
surely
,
if
there
be
constant
attachment
on
each
side
,
our
heart
must
understand
each
other
ere
long
.
<EOS>
We
be
not
boy
and
girl
,
to
be
captiously
irritable
,
mislead
by
every
moment
's
inadvertence
,
and
wantonly
play
with
our
own
happiness
.
"
<EOS>
and
yet
,
a
few
minute
afterwards
,
she
feel
as
if
their
being
in
company
with
each
other
,
under
their
present
circumstance
,
could
only
be
expose
them
to
inadvertency
and
misconstruction
of
the
most
mischievous
kind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Anne

Mary
,

at
her
window

I

the

"
<EOS>
it

<EOS>
He

to
leave
Bath
at
nine
this
morning
,
and
do
not
come

"
  
<EOS>
as
she
speak
,
she
feel
that
Captain
Wentworth
be
look
at
her
,
the
consciousness
of
which
vexed
and
embarrass
her
,
and
make
her
regret
that
she
have
say
so
much
,
simple
as
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
,
resent
that
she
should
be
suppose
not
to
know
her
own
cousin
,
begin
talk
very
warmly
about
the
family
feature

and
protest
still
more
positively
that
it
be
Mr
Elliot
,
call
again
upon
Anne
to
come
and
look
for
herself
,
but
Anne
do
not
mean
to
stir
,
and
try
to
be
cool
and
unconcerned
.
<EOS>
Her
distress
return
,
however
,
on
perceive
smile
and
intelligent
glance
pass
between
two
or
three
of
the
lady
visitor
,
as
if
they
believe
themselves
quite
in
the
secret
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
that
the
report
concern
her
have
spread
,
and
a
short
pause
succeed
,
which
seem
to
ensure
that
it
would
now
spread
farther
.

"

Mary

<EOS>
to
pacify
Mary
,
and
perhaps
screen
her
own
embarrassment
,
Anne
do
move
quietly
to
the
window

<EOS>
She
be
just
in
time
to
ascertain
that
it
really
be
Mr
Elliot
,
which
she
have
never
believe
,
before
he
disappear
on
one
side
,
as
Mrs
Clay
walk
quickly
off
on
the
other
;
and
check
the
surprise
which
she
could
not
but
feel
at
such
an
appearance
of
friendly
conference
between
two
person
of
totally
opposite

she
calmly

who
see
that
Captain

be
all
attention

look

listen
with
his
whole
soul

that
the
last
word
bring
his

eye
from
Charles
to
herself

<EOS>
Charles
and
Mary
still
talk
on
in

he
,
half
serious

half
jesting

maintain
the
scheme

invariably
serious

most

Mrs

Charles

Captain
Wentworth
leave

whether

<EOS>
how
mortifying
to
feel
that
it
be
so
!
  
<EOS>
Her
jealous
eye
be
satisfied
in
one
particular
.
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
be
acknowledge
again
by
each
,
by
Elizabeth
more
graciously
than
before
.
<EOS>
She
even
address
him
once
,
and
look
at
him
more
than
once
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
,
in
fact
,
revolve
a
great
measure
.
<EOS>
the
sequel
explain
it
.
<EOS>
after
the
waste
of
a
few
minute
in
say
the
proper
nothing
,
she
begin
to
give
the
invitation
which
be
to
comprise
all
the
remain
due
of
the
Musgroves
.
"
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
evening
,
to
meet
a
few
friend
:
no
formal
party
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
say
very
gracefully
,
and
the
card
with
which
she
have
provide
herself
,
the
"
Miss
Elliot
at
home
,
"
be
lay
on
the
table
,
with
a
courteous
,
comprehensive
smile
to
all
,
and
one
smile
and
one
card
more
decidedly
for
Captain
Wentworth
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
that
Elizabeth
have
be
long
enough
in
Bath
to
understand
the
importance
of
a
man
of
such
an
air
and
appearance
as
his
.
<EOS>
the
past
be
nothing
.
<EOS>
the
present
be
that
Captain
Wentworth
would
move
about
well
in
her
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
the
card
be
pointedly
give
,
and
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
arise
and
disappear
.
  
<EOS>
the
interruption
have
be
short
,
though
severe
,
and
ease
and
animation
return
to
most
of
those
they
leave
as
the
door
shut
them
out
,
but
not
to
Anne
.
<EOS>
She
could
think
only
of
the
invitation
she
have
with
such
astonishment
witness
,
and
of
the
manner
in
which
it
have
be
receive
;
a
manner
of
doubtful
meaning
,
of
surprise
rather
than
gratification
,
of
polite
acknowledgement
rather
than
acceptance
.
<EOS>
She
know
him
;
she
see
disdain
in
his
eye
,
and
could
not
venture
to
believe
that
he
have
determine
to
accept
such
an
offering
,
as
an
atonement
for
all
the
insolence
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
Her
spirit
sink
.
<EOS>
He
hold
the
card
in
his
hand
after
they
be
go
,
as
if
deeply
consider
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
only
think
of
Elizabeth
's
include
everybody
!
"
<EOS>
whisper
Mary
very
audibly
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wonder
Captain
Wentworth
be
delighted
!
<EOS>
You
see
he
can
not
put
the
card
out
of
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
catch
his
eye
,
see
his
cheek
glow
,
and
his
mouth
form
itself
into
a
momentary
expression
of
contempt
,
and
turn
away
,
that
she
may
neither
see
nor
hear
more
to
vex
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
party
separate
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
have
their
own
pursuit
,
the
lady
proceed
on
their
own
business
,
and
they
meet
no
more
while
Anne
belong
to
them
.
<EOS>
She
be
earnestly
beg
to
return
and
dine
,
and
give
them
all
the
rest
of
the
day
,
but
her
spirit
have
be
so
long
exert
that
at
present
she
feel
unequal
to
more
,
and
fit
only
for
home
,
where
she
may
be
sure
of
be
as
silent
as
she
choose
.
  
<EOS>
promising
to
be
with
them
<EOS>
the
whole
of
the
following
morning
,
therefore
,
she
close
the
fatigue
of
the
present
by
a
toilsome
walk
to
Camden
Place
,
there
to
spend
the
evening
chiefly
in
listen
to
the
busy
arrangement
of
Elizabeth
and
Mrs
Clay
for
the
morrow
's
party
,
the
frequent
enumeration
of
the
person
invite
,
and
the
continually
improve
detail
of
all
the
embellishment
which
be
to
make
it
the
most
completely
elegant
of
its
kind
in
Bath
,
while
harass
herself
with
the
never
-
end
question
,
of
whether
Captain
Wentworth
would
come
or
not
?
<EOS>
They
be
reckon
him
as
certain
,
but
with
her
it
be
a
gnawing
solicitude
never
appease
for
five
minute
together
.
<EOS>
She
generally
think
he
would
come
,
because
she
generally
think
he
ought
;
but
it
be
a
case
which
she
could
not
so
shape
into
any
positive
act
of
duty
or
discretion
,
as
inevitably
to
defy
the
suggestion
of
very
opposite
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
She
only
rouse
herself
from
the
brooding
of
this
restless
agitation
,
to
let
Mrs
Clay
know
that
she
have
be
see
with
Mr
Elliot
three
hour
after
his
being
suppose
to
be
out
of
Bath
,
for
have
watch
in
vain
for
some
intimation
of
the
interview
from
the
lady
herself
,
she
determine
to
mention
it
,
and
it
seem
to
her
there
be
guilt
in
Mrs
Clay
's
face
as
she
listen
.
<EOS>
It
be
transient
:
clear
away
in
an
instant
;
but
Anne
could
imagine
she
read
there
the
consciousness
of
have
,
by
some
complication
of
mutual
trick
,
or
some
overbearing
authority
of
his
,
be
oblige
to
attend
(
perhaps
for
half
an
hour
)
to
his
lecture
and
restriction
on
her
design
on
Sir
Walter
.
<EOS>
She
exclaim
,
however
,
with
a
very
tolerable
imitation
of
nature
:
    
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
dear
!
<EOS>
very
true
.
<EOS>
only
think
,
Miss
Elliot
,
to
my
great
surprise
I
meet
with
Mr
Elliot
in
Bath
Street
.
<EOS>
I
be
never
more
astonished
.
<EOS>
He
turn
back
and
walk
with
me
to
the
Pump
Yard
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
prevent
set
off
for
Thornberry
,
but
I
really
forget
by
what
;
for
I
be
in
a
hurry
,
and
could
not
much
attend
,
and
I
can
only
answer
for
his
be
determine
not
to
be
delay
in
his
return
.
<EOS>
He
want
to
know
how
early
he
may
be
admit
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
be
full
of
"
to
-
morrow
,
"
and
it
be
very
evident
that
I
have
be
full
of
it
too
,
ever
since
I
enter
the
house
,
and
learn
the
extension
of
your
plan
and
all
that
have
happen
,
or
my
see
him
could
never
have
go
so
entirely
out
of
my
head
.
"
    
<EOS>
one
day
only
have
pass
since
Anne
's
conversation
with
Mrs
Smith
;
but
a
keen
interest
have
succeed
,
and
she
be
now
so
little
touch
by
Mr
Elliot
's
conduct
,
except
by
its
effect
in
one
quarter
,
that
it
become
a
matter
of
course
the
next
morning
,
still
to
defer
her
explanatory
visit
in
Rivers
Street
.
<EOS>
She
have
promise
to
be
with
the
Musgroves
from
breakfast
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
Her
faith
be
plight
,
and
Mr
Elliot
's
character
,
like
the
Sultaness
Scheherazade
's
head
,
must
live
another
day
.
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
keep
her
appointment
punctually
,
however
;
the
weather
be
unfavourable
,
and
she
have
grieve
over
the
rain
on
her
friend
'
account
,
and
feel
it
very
much
on
her
own
,
before
she
be
able
to
attempt
the
walk
.
<EOS>
when
she
reach
the
White
Hart
,
and
make
her
way
to
the
proper
apartment
,
she
find
herself
neither
arrive
quite
in
time
,
nor
the
first
to
arrive
.
<EOS>
the
party
before
her
be
,
Mrs
Musgrove
,
talk
to
Mrs
Croft
,
and
Captain
Harville
to
Captain
Wentworth
;
and
she
immediately
hear
that
Mary
and
Henrietta
,
too
impatient
to
wait
,
have
go
out
the
moment
it
have
clear
,
but
would
be
back
again
soon
,
and
that
the
strict
injunction
have
be
leave
with
Mrs
Musgrove
to
keep
her
there
till
they
return
.
<EOS>
She
have
only
to
submit
,
sit
down
,
be
outwardly
compose
,
and
feel
herself
plunge
at
once
in
all
the
agitation
which
she
have
merely
lay
her
account
of
taste
a
little
before
the
morning
close
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
delay
,
no
waste
of
time
.
<EOS>
She
be
deep
in
the
happiness
of
such
misery
,
or
the
misery
of
such
happiness
,
instantly
.
<EOS>
two
minute
after
her
enter
the
room
,
Captain
Wentworth
say
    
"
We
will
write
the
letter
we
be
talk
of
,
Harville
,
now
,
if
you
will
give
me
material
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
material
be
at
hand
,
on
a
separate
table
;
he
go
to
it
,
and
nearly
turn
his
back
to
them
all
,
be
engross
by
write
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Musgrove
be
give
Mrs
Croft
the
history
of
her
eld
daughter
's
engagement
,
and
just
in
that
inconvenient
tone
of
voice
which
be
perfectly
audible
while
it
pretend
to
be
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
Anne
feel
that
she
do
not
belong
to
the
conversation
,
and
yet
,
as
Captain
Harville
seem
thoughtful
and
not
disposed
to
talk
,
she
could
not
avoid
hear
many
undesirable
particular
;
such
as
,
"
how
Mr
Musgrove
and
my
brother
Hayter
have
meet
again
and
again
to
talk
it
over
;
what
my
brother
Hayter
have
say
one
day
,
and
what
Mr
Musgrove
have
propose
the
next
,
and
what
have
occur
to
my
sister
Hayter
,
and
what
the
young
people
have
wish
,
and
what
I
say
at
first
I
never
could
consent
to
,
but
be
afterwards
persuade
to
think
may
do
very
well
,
"
and
a
great
deal
in
the
same
style
of
open
-
hearted
communication
:
minutia
which
,
even
with
every
advantage
of
taste
and
delicacy
,
which
good
Mrs
Musgrove
could
not
give
,
could
be
properly
interesting
only
to
the
principal
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Croft
be
attend
with
great
good
-
humour
,
and
whenever
she
speak
at
all
,
it
be
very
sensibly
.
<EOS>
Anne
hope
the
gentleman
may
each
be
too
much
self
-
occupy
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
,
madam
,
all
these
thing
consider
,
"
say
Mrs
Musgrove
,
in
her
powerful
whisper
,
"
though
we
could
have
wish
it
different
,
yet
,
altogether
,
we
do
not
think
it
fair
to
stand
out
any
longer
,
for
Charles
Hayter
be
quite
wild
about
it
,
and
Henrietta
be
pretty
near
as
bad
;
and
<EOS>
so
we
think
they
have
better
marry
at
once
,
and
make
the
good
of
it
,
as
many
other
have
do
before
them
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
say
I
,
it
will
be
well
than
a
long
engagement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
precisely
what
I
be
go
to
observe
,
"
cry
Mrs
Croft
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
have
young
people
settle
on
a
small
income
at
once
,
and
have
to
struggle
with
a
few
difficulty
together
,
than
be
involve
in
a
long
engagement
.
<EOS>
I
always
think
that
no
mutual
 
"
  
"
oh
!
dear
Mrs
Croft
,
"
cry
Mrs
Musgrove
,
unable
to
let
her
finish
her
speech
,
"
there
be
nothing
I
so
abominate
for
young
people
as
a
long
engagement
.
<EOS>
It
be
what
I
always
protest
against
for
my
child
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
very
well
,
I
use
to
say
,
for
young
people
to
be
engage
,
if
there
be
a
certainty
of
their
be
able
to
marry
in
six
month
,
or
even
in
twelve
;
but
a
long
engagement
 
"
  
"
yes
,
dear
madam
,
"
say
Mrs
Croft
,
"
or
an
uncertain
engagement
,
an
engagement
which
may
be
long
.
<EOS>
to
begin
without
know
that
at
such
a
time
there
will
be
the
mean
of
marrying
,
I
hold
to
be
very
unsafe
and
unwise
,
and
what
I
think
all
parent
should
prevent
as
far
as
they
can
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
find
an
unexpected
interest
here
.
<EOS>
She
feel
its
application
to
herself
,
feel
it
in
a
nervous
thrill
all
over
her
;
and
at
the
same
moment
that
her
eye
instinctively
glance
towards
the
distant
table
,
Captain
Wentworth
's
pen
cease
to
move
,
his
head
be
raise
,
pause
,
listening
,
and
he
turn
round
the
next
instant
to
give
a
look
,
one
quick
,
conscious
look
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
lady
continue
to
talk
,
to
re
-
urge
the
same
admit
truth
,
and
enforce
them
with
such
example
of
the
ill
effect
of
a
contrary
practice
as
have
fall
within
their
observation
,
but
Anne
hear
nothing
distinctly
;
it
be
only
a
buzz
of
word
in
her
ear
,
her
mind
be
in
confusion

<EOS>
Captain
Harville
,
who
have
in
truth
be
hear
none
of
it
,
now
leave
his
seat
,
and
move
to
a
window
,
and
Anne
seem
to
watch
him
,
though
it
be
from
thorough
absence
of
mind
,
become
gradually
sensible
that
he
be
invite
her
to
join
him
where
he

<EOS>
He
look
at
her
with
a
smile
,
and
a
little
motion
of
the
head
,
which
express
,
"
come
to

I
have
something
to
say

and
the
unaffected

easy
kindness
of
manner

She
rouse
herself
and

<EOS>
the
window
at
which
he

nearer

as

Captain
Harville

assume
the
serious

thoughtful

Miss

Captain
Harville
smile

as
much
as

do
you
claim
that
for
your

and
she
answer
the
question

smile
also
,
"
yes

<EOS>
We
certainly
do
not
forget
you
as
soon
as
you

us

<EOS>
It
be
,
perhaps
,
our
fate
rather
than
our
merit

<EOS>
We
can
not

ourselves

We

a
profession

take
you
back

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
grant
your
assertion

the

do
all

soon

him

we

,
Captain
Harville

<EOS>
if
the

it

from

it

no

I

man

to
be
inconstant
and
forget
those
they
do
love
,
or
have
love

<EOS>
I
believe
the
reverse
.
<EOS>
I
believe
in
a
true
analogy
between
our
bodily
frame
and
our
mental
;
and
that
as
our
body
be
the
strong
,
so
be
our
feeling
;
capable
of
bear
most
rough
usage
,
and
ride
out
the
heavy
weather
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
feeling
may
be
the
strong
,
"
reply
Anne
,
"
but
the
same
spirit
of
analogy
will
authorise
me
to
assert
that
our
be
the
most
tender

<EOS>
man
be
more
robust
than
woman
,
but
he
be
not
longer

which
exactly
explain
my
view
of
the
nature
of
their
attachment
.
<EOS>
nay
,
it
would
be
too
hard
upon
you
,
if
it
be
otherwise
.
<EOS>
You
have
difficulty

and
privation

danger
enough
to
struggle
with
.
<EOS>
You
be
always
labour

expose
to
every

<EOS>
Your

hard

indeed

(
with
a
falter
voice
)
,
"
if
woman
's
feeling
be
to
be
add
to
all
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
never
agree
upon
this
question
,
"
Captain
Harville
be
begin
to
say
,
when
a
slight
noise
call
their
attention
to
Captain
Wentworth
's
hitherto
perfectly
quiet
division
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
It
be
nothing
more
than
that
his
pen
have
fall
down
;
but
Anne
be
startle
at
find
him
nearer
than
she
have
suppose
,
and
half
inclined
to
suspect
that
the
pen
have
only
fall
because
he
have
be
occupy
by
them

strive
to
catch
sound
,

yet
she

Captain

(
lower
his

"
as
I
be
say
we
shall
never
agree
,
I
suppose
,
upon
this
point
.
<EOS>
no
man
and
woman
,
would
,
probably
.
<EOS>
but
let
me
observe
that
all
history
be
against
you
 
all
story
,
prose
and
verse
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
such
a
memory
as
Benwick
,
I
could
bring
you
fifty
quotation
in
a
moment
on
my
side
the
argument
,
and
I
do
not
think
I
ever
open
a
book
in

life
which
have
not
something
to
say
upon

's
inconstancy

<EOS>
song

all

<EOS>
education

be

much
high
a

the

<EOS>
I
will
not
allow
book
to

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"

how
shall
we
prove
anything
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
never
shall
.
<EOS>
We
never
can
expect
to
prove
any
thing
upon
such
a
point
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
difference
of
opinion
which
do
not
admit
of
proof
.
<EOS>
We
each
begin
,
probably
,
with
a
little
bias
towards
our
own
sex
;
and
upon
that
bias
build
every
circumstance
in
favour
of
it
which
have
occur
within
our
own
circle
;
many
of
which
circumstance
(
perhaps
those
very
case
which
strike
us
the
most
)
may
be
precisely
such
as
can
not
be
bring
forward
without
betray
a
confidence
,
or
in
some
respect
say
what
should
not
be
say

<EOS>
"
  
"
ah
!
"
cry
Captain
Harville
,
in
a
tone
of
strong
feeling

"
if
I
could
but
make
you
comprehend
what
a
man
suffer
when
he
take
a
last
look
at
his

child
,
and
watch
the
boat
that
he
have
send
them
off
in
,
as
long
as
it
be
in
sight
,
and
then
turn
away
and
say
,
"
God
know
whether
we
ever
meet
again

and
then
,
if
I
could
convey
to
you
the
glow
of
his

again

when
,
come
back
after
a

absence

,

oblige

put

mine

justice

soon

never

such

go
away

the

Captain

solitary

Anne
could
do
no
more
;

her
heart
prophesy
some
mischance
to
damp
the
perfection
of
her
felicity

<EOS>
It
could
not

very
lasting

however

<EOS>
even
if
he
do
not
come
to
Camden
Place

it

send
an
intelligible
sentence

momentary
vexation

<EOS>
Charles
,
in
his
real
concern

good
nature
,
would
go
home
with
her
;
there
be
no
prevent
him
.
<EOS>
this
be
almost
cruel
.
<EOS>
but
she
could
not
be
long
ungrateful
;
he
be
sacrifice
an
engagement
at
a
gunsmith
's
,
to
be
of
use
to
her
;
and
she
set
off
with
him
,
with
no
feeling
but
gratitude
apparent
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
on
Union
Street
,
when
a
quick
step
behind
,
a
something
of
familiar
sound
,
give
her
two
moment
'
preparation
for
the
sight
of
Captain
Wentworth
.
<EOS>
He
join
them
;
but
,
as
if
irresolute
whether
to
join
or
to
pass
on
,
say
nothing
,
only
look
.
<EOS>
Anne
could
command
herself
enough
to
receive
that
look
,
and
not
repulsively
.
<EOS>
the
cheek
which
have
be
pale
now
glow
,
and
the
movement
which
have
hesitate
be
decide
.
<EOS>
He
walk
by
her
side
.
<EOS>
presently
,
strike
by
a
sudden
thought
,
Charles
say
    
"
Captain
Wentworth
,
which
way
be
you
go
?
<EOS>
only
to
Gay
Street
,
or
farther
up
the
town
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
,
"
reply
Captain
Wentworth
,
surprised
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
go
as
high
as
Belmont
?
<EOS>
be
you
go
near
Camden
Place
?
<EOS>
because
,
if
you
be
,
I
shall
have
no
scruple
in
ask
you
to
take
my
place
,
and
give
Anne
your
arm
to
her
father
's
door
.
<EOS>
She
be
rather
do
for
this
morning
,
and
must
not
go
so
far
without
help
,
and
I
ought
to
be
at
that
fellow
's
in
the
Market
Place
.
<EOS>
He
promise
me
the
sight
of
a
capital
gun
<EOS>
he
be
just
go
to
send
off
;
say
he
would
keep
it
unpacked
to
the
last
possible
moment
,
that
I
may
see
it
;
and
if
I
do
not
turn
back
now
,
I
have
no
chance
.
<EOS>
by
his
description
,
a
good
deal
like
the
second
size
double
-
barrel
of
mine
,
which
you
shoot
with
one
day
round
Winthrop
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
could
not
be
an
objection
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
only
the
most
proper
alacrity
,
a
most
obliging
compliance
for
public
view
;
and
smile
rein
in
and
spirit
dance
in
private
rapture
.
<EOS>
in
half
a
minute
Charles
be
at
the
bottom
of
Union
Street
again
,
and
the
other
two
proceeding
together
:
and
soon
word
enough
have
pass
between
them
to
decide
their
direction
towards
the
comparatively
quiet
and
retired
gravel
walk
,
where
the
power
of
conversation
would
make
the
present
hour
a
blessing
indeed
,
and
prepare
it
for
all
the
immortality
which
the
happy
recollection
of
their
own
future
life
could
bestow
.
<EOS>
there
they
exchange
again
those
feeling
and
those
promise
which
have
once
before
seem
to
secure
everything
,
but
which
have
be
follow
by
so
many
,
many
year
of
division
and
estrangement
.
<EOS>
there
they
return
again
into
the
past
,
more
exquisitely
happy
,
perhaps
,
in
their
re
-
union
,
than
when
it
have
be
first
project
;
more
tender
,
more
try
,
more
fix
in
a
knowledge
of
each
other
's
character
,
truth
,
and
attachment
;
more
equal
to
act
,
more
justified
in
act
.
<EOS>
and
there
,
as
they
slowly
pace
the
gradual
ascent
,
heedless
of
every
group
around
them
,
see
neither
saunter
politician
,
bustle
housekeeper
,
flirt
girl
,
nor
nursery
-
maid
and
child
,
they
could
indulge
in
those
retrospection
and
acknowledgement
,
and
especially
in
those
explanation
of
what
have
directly
precede
the
present
moment
,
which
be
so
poignant
and
so
ceaseless
in
interest
.
<EOS>
all
the
little
variation
of
the
last
week
be
go
through
;
and
of
yesterday
and
today
there
could
scarcely
be
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
not
mistake
him
.
<EOS>
jealousy
of
Mr
Elliot
have
be
the
retard
weight
,
the
doubt
,
the
torment
.
<EOS>
that
have
begin
to
operate
in
the
very
hour
of
first
meeting
her
in
Bath
;
that
have
return
,
after
a
short
suspension
,
to
ruin
the
concert
;
and
that
have
influence
him
in
everything
he
have
say
and
do
,
or
omit
to
say
and
do
,
in
the
last
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
gradually
yield
to
the
well
hope
which
her
look
,
or
word
,
or
action
occasionally
encourage
;
it
have
be
vanquish
at
last
by
those
sentiment
and
those
tone
which
have
reach
him
while
she
talk
with
Captain
Harville
;
and
under
the
irresistible
governance
of
which
he
have
seize
a
sheet
of
paper
,
and
pour
out
his
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
of
what
he
have
then
write
,
nothing
be
to
be
retract
or
qualify
.
<EOS>
He
persist
in
have
love
none
but
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
be
supplant
.
<EOS>
He
never
even
believe
himself
to
see
her
equal
.
<EOS>
thus
much
indeed
he
be
oblige
to
acknowledge
:
that
he
have
be
constant
unconsciously
,
nay
unintentionally
;
that
he
have
mean
to
forget
her
,
and
believe
it
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
He
have
imagine
himself
indifferent
,
when
he
have
only
be
angry
;
and
he
have
be
unjust
to
her
merit
,
because
he
have
be
a
sufferer
from
them
.
<EOS>
Her
character
be
now
fix
on
his
mind
as
perfection
itself
,
maintain
the
lovely
medium
of
fortitude
and
gentleness
;
but
he
be
oblige
to
acknowledge
that
only
at
Uppercross
have
he
learn
to
do
her
justice
,
and
only
at
Lyme
<EOS>
have
he
begin
to
understand
himself
.
<EOS>
at
Lyme
,
he
have
receive
lesson
of
more
than
one
sort
.
<EOS>
the
pass
admiration
of
Mr
Elliot
have
at
least
rouse
him
,
and
the
scene
on
the
Cobb
and
at
Captain
Harville
's
have
fix
her
superiority
.
  
<EOS>
in
his
precede
attempt
to
attach
himself
to
Louisa
Musgrove
(
the
attempt
of
angry
pride
)
,
he
protest
that
he
have
for
ever
feel
it
to
be
impossible
;
that
he
have
not
care
,
could
not
care
,
for
Louisa
;
though
till
that
day
,
till
the
leisure
for
reflection
which
follow
it
,
he
have
not
understand
the
perfect
excellence
of
the
mind
with
which
Louisa
's
could
so
ill
bear
a
comparison
,
or
the
perfect
unrivalled
hold
it
possess
over
his
own
.
<EOS>
there
,
he
have
learn
to
distinguish
between
the
steadiness
of
principle
and
the
obstinacy
of
self
-
will
,
between
the
daring
of
heedlessness
and
the
resolution
of
a
collect
mind
.
<EOS>
there
he
have
see
everything
to
exalt
in
his
estimation
the
woman
he
have
lose
;
and
there
begin
to
deplore
the
pride
,
the
folly
,
the
madness
of
resentment
,
which
have
keep
him
from
try
to
regain
her
when
throw
in
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
from
that
period
his
penance
have
become
severe
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
sooner
be
free
from
the
horror
and
remorse
attend
the
first
few
day
of
Louisa
's
accident
,
no
sooner
begin
to
feel
himself
alive
again
,
than
he
have
begin
to
feel
himself
,
though
alive
,
not
at
liberty
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
find
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
I
be
consider
by
Harville
an
engaged
man
!
<EOS>
that
neither
Harville
nor
his
wife
entertain
a
doubt
of
our
mutual
attachment
.
<EOS>
I
be
startled
and
shock
.
<EOS>
to
a
degree
,
I
could
contradict
this
instantly
;
but
,
when
I
begin
to
reflect
that
other
may
have
feel
the
same
 
<EOS>
her
own
family
,
nay
,
perhaps
herself
 
<EOS>
I
be
no
longer
at
my
own
disposal
.
<EOS>
I
be
her
in
honour
if
she
wish
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
unguarded
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
think
seriously
on
this
subject
before
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
consider
that
my
excessive
intimacy
must
have
its
danger
of
ill
consequence
in
many
way
;
and
that
I
have
no
right
to
be
try
whether
I
could
attach
myself
to
either
of
the
girl
,
at
the
risk
of
raise
even
an
unpleasant
report
,
be
there
no
other
ill
effect
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
grossly
wrong
,
and
must
abide
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
find
too
late
,
in
short
,
that
he
have
entangle
himself
;
and
that
precisely
as
he
become
fully
satisfied
of
his
not
care
for
Louisa
at
all
,
he
must
regard
himself
as
bind
to
her
,
if
her
sentiment
for
him
be
what
the
Harvilles
suppose
.
<EOS>
It
determine
him
to
leave
Lyme
,
and
await
her
complete
recovery
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
He
would
gladly
weaken
,
by
any
fair
mean
,
whatever
feeling
or
speculation
concern
him
may
exist
;
and
he
go
,
therefore
,
to
his
brother
's
,
mean
after
a
while
to
return
to
Kellynch
,
and
act
as
circumstance
may
require
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
six
week
with
Edward
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
see
him
happy
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
no
other
pleasure
.
<EOS>
I
deserve
none
.
<EOS>
He
enquire
after
you
very
particularly
;
ask
even
if
you
be
personally
alter
,
little
suspect
that
to
my
eye
you
could
never
alter
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
smile
,
and
let
it
pass
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
pleasing
a
blunder
for
a
reproach
.
<EOS>
It
be
something
for
a
woman
to
be
assure
,
in
her
eight
-
and
-
twentieth
year
,
that
she
have
not
lose
one
charm
of
early
youth
;
but
the
value
of
such
homage
be
inexpressibly
increase
to
Anne
,
by
compare
it
with
former
word
,
and
feel
it
to
be
the
result
,
not
the
cause
of
a
revival
of
his
warm
attachment
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
remain
in
Shropshire
,
lament
the
blindness
of
his
own
pride
,
and
the
blunder
of
his
own
calculation
,
till
at
once
release
from
Louisa
by
the
astonishing
and
felicitous
intelligence
of
her
engagement
with
Benwick
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
,
"
say
he
,
"
end
the
bad
of
my
state
;
for
now
I
could
at
least
put
myself
in
the
way
of
happiness
;
I
could
exert
myself
;
I
could
do
something
.
<EOS>
but
to
be
wait
so
long
in
inaction
,
and
wait
only
for
evil
,
have
be
dreadful
.
<EOS>
within
the
first
five
minute
I
say
,
"
I
will
be
at
Bath
on
Wednesday
,
"
and
I
be
.
<EOS>
be
it
unpardonable
to
think
it
worth
my
while
to
come
?
<EOS>
and
to
arrive
with
some
degree
of
hope
?
<EOS>
You
be
single
.
<EOS>
It
be
possible
that
you
may
retain
the
feeling
of
the
past
,
as
I
do
;
and
one
encouragement
happen
to
be
mine
.
<EOS>
I
could
never
doubt
that
you
would
be
love
and
seek
by
other
,
but
I
know
to
a
certainty
that
you
have
refuse
one
man
,
at
least
,
of
well
pretension
than
myself
;
and
I
could
not
help
often
say
,
"
be
this
for
me
?

<EOS>
"
  
Their
first
meeting
in
Milsom
Street
afford
much
to
be
say
,
but
the
concert
still
more
.
<EOS>
that
evening
seem
to
be
make
up
of
exquisite
moment

<EOS>
the
moment
of
her
step
forward
in
the
Octagon
Room
to
speak
to
him

the
moment
of
Mr
Elliot

appear
and

her
away

one
or
two
subsequent
moment

mark
by
return

to
see
your
cousin
close
by
you
,
converse
and
smile
,
and
feel
all
the
horrible
eligibility
and
propriety
of
the
match
!
<EOS>
to
consider
it
as
the
certain
wish
of
every
being
who
could
hope
to
influence
you
!
<EOS>
even
if
your
own
feeling
be
reluctant

indifferent
,
to
consider
what
powerful
support
would
be
his

<EOS>
be
it
not
enough
to
make
the
fool
of
me
which
I
appear
?
<EOS>
how
could
I
look
on
without
agony
?
<EOS>
be
not
the
very
sight
of
the
friend
who
sit
behind
you
,
be
not
the
recollection
of
what
have
be
<EOS>
,
the
knowledge
of
her
influence
,
the
indelible
,
immoveable
impression
of
what
persuasion
have
once
do
 
be
it
not
all
against
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
distinguish
,
"
reply
Anne
.
<EOS>
"
You
should
not
have
suspect
me
now
;
the
case
be
so
different
,
and
my
age
be
so
different
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
wrong
in
yield
to
persuasion
once
,
remember
that
it
be
to
persuasion
exert
on
the
side
of
safety
,
not
of
risk
.
<EOS>
when
I
yield
,
I
think
it
be
to
duty
,
but
no
duty
could
be
call
in
aid
here
.
<EOS>
in
marry
a
man
indifferent
to
me
,
all
risk
would
have
be
incur
,
and
all
duty
violate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
ought
to
have
reason
thus
,
"
he
reply
,
"
but
I
could
not
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
derive
benefit
from
the
late
knowledge
I
have
acquire
of
your
character
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
bring
it
into
play
;
it
be
overwhelmed
,
bury
,
lose
in
those
early
feeling
which
I
have
be
smart
under
year
after
year
.
<EOS>
I
could
think
of
you
only
as
one
who
have
yield
,
who
have
give
me
up
,
who
have
be
influence
by
any
one
rather
than
by
me
.
<EOS>
I
see
you
with
the
very
person
who
have
guide
you
in
that
year
of
misery
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
reason
to
believe
her
of
less
authority
now
.
<EOS>
the
force
of
habit
be
to
be
add
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
think
,
"
say
Anne
,
"
that
my
manner
to
yourself
may
have
spare
you
much
or
all
of
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
!
<EOS>
your
manner
may
be
only
the
ease
which
your
engagement
to
another
man
would
give
.
<EOS>
I
leave
you
in
this
belief
;
and
yet
,
<EOS>
I
be
determined
to
see
you
again
.
<EOS>
My
spirit
rally
with
the
morning
,
and
I
feel
that
I
have
still
a
motive
for
remain
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
last
Anne
be
at
home
again
,
and
happy
than
any
one
in
that
house
could
have
conceive
.
<EOS>
all
the
surprise
and
suspense
,
and
every
other
painful
part
of
the
morning
dissipate
by
this
conversation
,
she
re
-
enter
the
house
so
happy
as
to
be
oblige
to
find
an
alloy
in
some
momentary
apprehension
of
its
be
impossible
to
last
.
<EOS>
an
interval
of
meditation
,
serious
and
grateful
,
be
the
good
corrective
of
everything
dangerous
in
such
high
-
wrought
felicity
;
and
she
go
to
her
room
,
and
grow
steadfast
and
fearless
in
the
thankfulness
of
her
enjoyment
.
  
<EOS>
the
evening
come
,
the
drawing
-
room
be
light
up
,
the
company
assemble
.
<EOS>
It
be
but
a
card
party
,
it
be
but
a
mixture
of
those
who
have
never
meet
before
,
and
those
who
meet
too
often
;
a
commonplace
business
,
too
numerous
for
intimacy
,
too
small
for
variety
;
but
Anne
have
never
find
an
evening
short
.
<EOS>
glowing
and
lovely
in
sensibility
and
happiness
,
and
more
generally
admire
than
she
think
about
or
care
for
,
she
have
cheerful
or
forbear
feeling
for
every
creature
around
her
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
be
there
;
she
avoid
,
but
she
could
pity
him
.
<EOS>
the
Wallises
,
she
have
amusement
in
understand
them
.
<EOS>
Lady
Dalrymple
and
Miss
Carteret
 
they
would
soon
be
innoxious
cousin
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
care
not
for
Mrs
Clay
,
and
have
nothing
to
blush
for
in
the
public
manner
of
her
father
and
sister
.
<EOS>
with
the
Musgroves
,
there
be
the
happy
chat
of
perfect
ease
;
with
Captain
Harville
,
the
kind
-
hearted
intercourse
of
brother
and
sister
;
with
Lady
Russell
,
attempt
at
conversation
,
which
a
delicious
consciousness
cut
short
;
with
Admiral
and
Mrs
Croft
,
everything
of
peculiar
cordiality
and
fervent
interest
,
which
the
same
consciousness
seek
to
conceal
;
and
with
Captain
Wentworth
,
some
moment
of
communication
continually
occur
,
and
always
the
hope
of
more
,
and
always
the
knowledge
of
his
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
one
of
these
short
meeting
,
each
apparently
occupy
in
admire
a
fine
display
of
greenhouse
plant
<EOS>
,
that
she
say
    
"
I
have
be
think
over
the
past
,
and
try
impartially
to
judge
of
the
right
and
wrong
,
I
mean
with
regard
to
myself
;
and
I
must
believe
that
I
be
right
,
much
as
I
suffer
from
it
,
that
I
be
perfectly
right
in
be
guide
by
the
friend
whom
you
will
love
better
than
you
do
now
.
<EOS>
to
me
,
she
be
in
the
place
of
a
parent
.
<EOS>
do
not
mistake
me
,
however
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
say
that
she
do
not
err
in
her
advice
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
perhaps
,
one
of
those
case
in
which
advice
be
good
or
bad
only
as
the
event
decide
;
and
for
myself
,
I
certainly
never
should
,
in
any
circumstance
of
tolerable
similarity
,
give
such
advice
.
<EOS>
but
I
mean
,
that
I
be
right
in
submit
to
her
,
and
that
if
I
have
do
otherwise
,
I
should
have
suffer
more
in
continue
the
engagement
than
I
do
even
in
give
it
up
,
because
I
should
have
suffer
in
my
conscience
.
<EOS>
I
have
now
,
as
far
as
such
a
sentiment
be
allowable
in
human
nature
,
nothing
to
reproach
myself
with
;
and
if
I
mistake
not
,
a
strong
sense
of
duty
be
no
bad
part
of
a
woman
's
portion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
look
at
her
,
look
at
Lady
Russell
,
and
look
again
at
her
,
reply
,
as
if
in
cool
deliberation
    
<EOS>
"
not
yet
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
hope
of
her
be
forgive
in
time
.
<EOS>
I
trust
to
be
in
charity
with
her
soon
.
<EOS>
but
I
too
have
be
think
over
the
past
,
and
a
question
have
suggest
itself
,
whether
there
may
not
have
be
one
person
more
my
enemy
even
than
that
lady
?
<EOS>
My
own
self
.
<EOS>
tell
me
if
,
when
I
return
to
England
in
the
year
eight
,
with
a
few
thousand
pound
,
and
be
post
into
the
Laconia
,
if
I
have
then
write
to
you
,
would
you
have
answer
my
letter
?
<EOS>
Would
you
,
in
short
,
have
renew
the
engagement
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
I
!
"
be
all
her
answer
;
but
the
accent
be
decisive
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
God
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
,
"
you
would
!
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
I
do
not
think
of
it
,
or
desire
it
,
as
what
could
alone
crown
all
my
other
success
;
but
I
be
proud
,
too
proud
to
ask
again
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
you
.
<EOS>
I
shut
my
eye
,
and
would
not
understand
you
,
or
do
you
justice
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
recollection
which
ought
to
make
me
forgive
every
one
soon
than
myself
.
<EOS>
six
year
of
separation
and
suffering
may
have
be
spare
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
sort
of
pain
,
too
,
which
be
new
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
use
to
the
gratification
of
believe
myself
to
earn
every
blessing
that
I
enjoy
.
<EOS>
I
have
value
myself
on
honourable
toil
and
just
reward
.
<EOS>
like
other
great
man
under
reverse
,
"
he
add
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
endeavour
to
subdue
my
mind
to
my
fortune
.
<EOS>
I
must
learn
to
brook
be
happy
than
I
deserve
.
"
    
<EOS>
who
can
be
in
doubt
of
what
follow
?
<EOS>
when
any
two
young
people
take
it
into
their
head
to
marry
,
they
be
pretty
sure
by
perseverance
to
carry
their
point
,
be
they
ever
so
poor
,
or
ever
so
imprudent
,
or
ever
so
little
likely
to
be
necessary
to
each
other
's
ultimate
comfort
.
<EOS>
this
may
be
bad
morality
to
conclude
with
,
but
I
believe
it
to
be
truth
;
and
if
such
party
succeed
,
how
should
a
Captain
Wentworth
and
an
Anne
Elliot
,
with
the
advantage
of
maturity
of
mind
,
consciousness
of
right
,
and
one
independent
fortune
between
them
,
fail
of
bear
down
every
opposition
?
<EOS>
They
may
in
fact
,
have
bear
down
a
great
deal
more
than
they
meet
with
,
for
there
be
little
to
distress
them
beyond
the
want
of
graciousness
and
warmth
.
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
make
no
objection
,
and
Elizabeth
do
nothing
bad
than
look
cold
and
unconcerned
.
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
,
with
five
-
and
-
twenty
thousand
pound
,
and
as
high
in
his
profession
as
merit
and
activity
could
place
him
,
be
no
longer
nobody
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
esteem
quite
worthy
to
address
the
daughter
of
a
foolish
,
spendthrift
baronet
,
who
have
not
have
principle
or
sense
enough
to
maintain
himself
in
the
situation
in
which
Providence
have
place
him
,
and
who
could
give
his
daughter
at
present
but
a
small
part
of
the
share
of
ten
thousand
pound
which
must
be
her
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
,
indeed
,
though
he
have
no
affection
for
Anne
,
and
no
vanity
flatter
,
to
make
him
really
happy
on
the
occasion
,
be
very
far
from
think
it
a
bad
match
for
her
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
when
he
see
more
of
Captain
Wentworth
,
see
him
repeatedly
by
daylight
,
and
eye
him
well
,
he
be
very
much
strike
by
his
personal
claim
,
and
feel
that
his
superiority
of
appearance
may
be
not
unfairly
balance
against
her
superiority
of
rank
;
and
all
this
,
assist
by
his
well
-
sound
name
,
enable
Sir
Walter
at
last
to
prepare
his
pen
,
with
a
very
good
grace
,
for
the
insertion
of
the
marriage
in
the
volume
of
honour
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
one
among
them
,
whose
opposition
of
feeling
could
excite
any
serious
anxiety
be
Lady
Russell
.
<EOS>
Anne
know
that
Lady
Russell
must
be
suffer
some
pain
in
understanding
and
relinquish
Mr
Elliot
,
and
be
make
some
struggle
to
become
truly
acquaint
with
,
and
do
justice
to
Captain
Wentworth
.
<EOS>
this
however
be
what
Lady
Russell
have
now
to
do
.
<EOS>
She
must
learn
to
feel
that
she
have
be
mistake
with
regard
to
both
;
that
she
have
be
unfairly
influence
by
appearance
in
each
;
that
because
Captain
Wentworth
's
manner
have
not
suit
her
own
idea
,
she
have
be
too
quick
in
suspect
them
to
indicate
a
character
of
dangerous
impetuosity
;
and
that
because
Mr
Elliot
's
manner
have
precisely
please
her
in
their
propriety
and
correctness
,
their
general
politeness
and
suavity
,
she
have
be
too
quick
in
receive
them
as
the
certain
result
of
the
most
correct
opinion
and
well
-
regulate
mind
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
less
for
Lady
Russell
to
do
,
than
to
admit
that
she
have
be
pretty
completely
wrong
,
and
to
take
up
a
new
set
of
opinion
and
of
hope
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
quickness
of
perception
in
some
,
a
nicety
in
the
discernment
of
character
,
a
natural
penetration
,
in
short
,
which
no
experience
in
other
can
equal
,
and
Lady
Russell
have
be
less
gifted
in
this
part
of
understanding
than
her
young
friend
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
a
very
good
woman
,
and
if
her
second
object
be
to
be
sensible
and
well
-
judging
,
her
first
be
to
see
Anne
happy
.
<EOS>
She
love
Anne
better
than
she
love
her
own
ability
;
and
when
the
awkwardness
of
the
beginning
be
over
,
find
little
hardship
in
attach
herself
as
a
mother
to
the
man
who
be
secure
the
happiness
of
her
other
child
.
  
<EOS>
of
all
the
family
,
Mary
be
probably
the
one
most
immediately
gratify
by
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
It
be
creditable
to
have
a
sister
marry
,
and
she
may
flatter
herself
with
have
be
greatly
instrumental
to
the
connexion
,
by
keep
Anne
with
her
in
the
autumn
;
and
as
her
own
sister
must
be
well
than
her
husband
's
sister
,
it
be
very
agreeable
that
Captain
Wentworth
should
be
a
rich
man
than
either
Captain
Benwick
or
Charles
Hayter
.
<EOS>
She
have
something
to
suffer
,
perhaps
,
when
they
come
into
contact
again
,
in
see
Anne
restore
to
the
right
of
seniority
,
and
the
mistress
of
a
very
pretty
landaulette
;
but
she
have
a
future
to
look
forward
to
,
of
powerful
consolation
.
<EOS>
Anne
have
no
Uppercross
Hall
before
her
,
no
landed
estate
,
no
headship
of
a
family
;
and
if
they
could
but
keep
Captain
Wentworth
from
be
make
a
baronet
,
she
would
not
change
situation
with
Anne
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
well
for
the
eld
sister
if
she
be
equally
satisfied
with
her
situation
,
for
a
change
be
not
very
probable
there
.
<EOS>
She
have
soon
the
mortification
of
see
Mr
Elliot
withdraw
,
and
no
one
of
proper
condition
have
since
present
himself
to
raise
even
the
unfounded
hope
which
sink
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
news
of
his
cousin
Anne
's
engagement
burst
on
Mr
Elliot
most
unexpectedly
.
<EOS>
It
derange
his
good
plan
of
domestic
happiness
,
his
good
hope
of
keep
Sir
Walter
single
by
the
watchfulness
which
a
son
-
in
-
law
's
right
would
have
give
.
<EOS>
but
,
though
discomfited
and
disappointed
,
he
could
still
do
something
for
his
own
interest
and
his
own
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
He
soon
quit
Bath
;
and
on
Mrs
Clay
's
quitting
it
soon
afterwards
,
and
be
next
hear
of
as
establish
under
his
protection
in
London
,
it
be
evident
how
double
a
game
he
have
be
play
,
and
how
determined
he
be
to
save
himself
from
be
cut
out
by
one
artful
woman
,
at
least
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Clay
's
affection
have
overpower
her
interest
,
and
she
have
sacrifice
,
for
the
young
man
's
sake
,
the
possibility
of
scheme
longer
for
Sir
Walter
.
<EOS>
She
have
ability
,
however
,
as
well
as
affection
;
and
it
be
now
a
doubtful
point
whether
his
cunning
,
or
her
,
may
finally
carry
the
day
;
whether
,
after
prevent
her
from
be
the
wife
of
Sir
Walter
,
he
may
not
be
wheedle
and
caress
at
last
into
make
her
the
wife
of
Sir
William
.
  
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
doubt
that
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
be
shock
and
mortify
by
the
loss
of
their
companion
,
and
the
discovery
of
their
deception
in
her
.
<EOS>
They
have
their
great
cousin
,
to
be
sure
,
to
resort
to
for
comfort
;
but
they
must
long
feel
that
to
flatter
and
follow
other
,
without
be
flatter
and
follow
in
turn
,
be
but
a
state
of
half
enjoyment
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
,
satisfy
at
a
very
early
period
of
Lady
Russell
's
meaning
to
love
Captain
Wentworth
as
she
ought
,
have
no
other
alloy
to
the
happiness
of
her
prospect
than
what
arise
from
the
consciousness
of
have
no
relation
to
bestow
on
him
which
a
man
of
sense
could
value
.
<EOS>
there
she
feel
her
own
inferiority
very
keenly
.
<EOS>
the
disproportion
in
their
fortune
be
nothing
;
it
do
not
give
her
a
moment
's
regret
;
but
to
have
no
family
to
receive
and
estimate
him
properly
,
nothing
of
respectability
,
of
harmony
,
of
good
will
to
offer
in
return
for
all
the
worth
and
all
the
prompt
welcome
which
meet
her
in
his
brother
and
sister
,
be
a
source
of
as
lively
pain
as
her
mind
could
well
be
sensible
of
under
circumstance
of
otherwise
strong
felicity
.
<EOS>
She
have
but
two
friend
in
the
world
to
add
to
his
list
,
Lady
Russell
and
Mrs
Smith
.
<EOS>
to
those
,
however
,
he
be
very
well
disposed
to
attach
himself
.
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
,
in
spite
of
all
her
former
transgression
,
he
could
now
value
from
his
heart
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
not
oblige
to
say
that
he
believe
her
to
have
be
right
in
originally
divide
them
,
he
be
ready
to
say
almost
everything
else
in
her
favour
,
and
as
for
Mrs
Smith
,
she
have
claim
of
various
kind
to
recommend
her
quickly
and
permanently
.
  
<EOS>
Her
recent
good
office
by
Anne
have
be
enough
in
themselves
,
and
their
marriage
,
instead
of
deprive
her
of
one
friend
,
secure
her
two
.
<EOS>
She
be
their
early
visitor
in
their
settle
life
;
and
Captain
Wentworth
,
by
put
her
in
the
way
of
recover
her
husband
's
property
in
the
West
Indies
,
by
write
for
her
,
act
for
her
,
and
see
her
through
all
the
petty
difficulty
of
the
case
with
the
activity
and
exertion
of
a
fearless
man
and
a
determined
friend
,
fully
requite
the
service
which
she
have
render
,
or
ever
mean
to
render
,
to
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Smith
's
enjoyment
be
not
spoil
by
this
improvement
of
income
,
with
some
improvement
of
health
,
and
the
acquisition
of
such
friend
to
be
often
with
,
for
her
cheerfulness
and
mental
alacrity
do
not
fail
her
;
and
while
these
prime
supply
of
good
remain
,
she
may
have
bid
defiance
even
to
great
accession
of
worldly
prosperity
.
<EOS>
She
may
have
be
absolutely
rich
and
perfectly
healthy
,
and
yet
be
happy
.
<EOS>
Her
spring
of
felicity
be
in
the
glow
of
her
spirit
,
as
her
friend
Anne
's
be
in
the
warmth
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Anne
be
tenderness
itself
,
and
she
have
the
full
worth
of
it
in
Captain
Wentworth
's
affection
.
<EOS>
His
profession
be
all
that
could
ever
make
her
friend
wish
that
tenderness
less
,
the
dread
of
a
future
war
all
that
could
dim
her
sunshine
.
<EOS>
She
glory
in
be
a
sailor
's
wife
,
but
she
must
pay
the
tax
of
quick
alarm
for
belong
to
that
profession
which
be
,
if
possible
,
more
distinguished
in
its
domestic
virtue
than
in
its
national
importance
.
