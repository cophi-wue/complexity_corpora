<EOS>
with
this
drop
of

at
the

of
my

I
will
show
you
the
roomy
workshop
of
Mr.
Jonathan
Burge
,
carpenter
and
builder
,
in
the
village
of
Hayslope
,
as
it
appear
on
the
eighteenth
of
June
,
in
the
year
of
our
Lord
1799
.
  
<EOS>
the
afternoon
sun
be
warm
on
the
five
workman
there
,
busy
upon
door
and
window
-
frame
and
wainscote
.
<EOS>
a
scent
of
pine
-
wood
from
a
tentlike
pile
of
plank
outside
the
open
door
mingle
itself
with
the
scent
of
the
elder
-
bush
which
be
spread
their
summer
snow
close
to
<EOS>
the
open
window
opposite
;
the
slanting
sunbeam
shine
through
the
transparent
shaving
that
fly
before
the
steady
plane
,
and
light
up
the
fine
grain
of
the
oak
panelling
which
stand
prop
against
the
wall
.
<EOS>
on
a
heap
of
those
soft
shaving
a
rough
,
grey
shepherd
dog
have
make
himself
a
pleasant
bed
,
and
be
lie
with
his
nose
between
his
fore
-
paw
,
occasionally
wrinkle
his
brow
to
cast
a
glance
at
the
tall
of
the
five
workman
,
who
be
carve
a
shield
in
the
centre
of
a
wooden
mantelpiece
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
this
workman
that
the
strong
barytone
belong
which
be
hear
above
the
sound
of
plane
and
hammer
singe
         
Awake
,
my
soul
,
and
with
the
sun
     
Thy
daily
stage
of
duty
run
;
     
shake
off
dull
sloth
...
  
<EOS>
here
some
measurement
be
to
be
take
which
require
more
concentrated
attention
,
and
the
sonorous
voice
subside
into
a
low
whistle
;
but
it
presently
break
out
again
with
renew
vigour
         
<EOS>
let
all
thy
converse
be
sincere
,
     
Thy
conscience
as
the
noonday
clear
.
  
<EOS>
such
a
voice
could
only
come
from
a
broad
chest
,
and
the
broad
chest
belong
to
a
large
-
boned
,
muscular
man
nearly
six
foot
high
,
with
a
back
so
flat
and
a
head
<EOS>
so
well
poise
that
when
he
draw
himself
up
to
take
a
more
distant
survey
of
his
work
,
he
have
the
air
of
a
soldier
stand
at
ease
.
<EOS>
the
sleeve
roll
up
above
the
elbow
<EOS>
show
an
arm
that
be
likely
to
win
the
prize
for
feat
of
strength
;
yet
the
long
supple
hand
,
with
its
broad
finger
-
tip
,
look
ready
for
work
of
skill
.
<EOS>
in
his
tall
stalwartness
Adam
Bede
be
a
Saxon
,
and
justify
his
name
;
but
the
jet
-
black
hair
,
make
the
more
noticeable
by
its
contrast
with
the
light
paper
cap
,
and
the
keen
glance
of
the
dark
eye
that
shine
from
under
strongly
mark
,
prominent
and
mobile
eyebrow
,
indicate
a
mixture
of
celtic
blood
.
<EOS>
the
face
be
large
and
roughly
hew
,
and
when
in
repose
have
no
other
beauty
than
such
as
belong
to
an
expression
of
good
-
humoured
honest
intelligence
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
clear
at
a
glance
that
the
next
workman
be
Adam
's
brother
.
<EOS>
He
be
nearly
as
tall
;
he
have
the
same
type
of
feature
,
the
same
hue
of
hair
and
complexion
;
but
the
strength
of
the
family
likeness
seem
only
to
render
more
conspicuous
the
remarkable
difference
of
expression
both
in
form
and
face
.
<EOS>
Seth
's
broad
shoulder
have
a
slight
stoop
;
his
eye
be
grey
;
his
eyebrow
have
less
prominence
and
more
repose
than
his
brother
's
;
and
his
glance
,
instead
of
be
keen
,
be
confiding
and
benign
.
<EOS>
He
have
throw
off
his
paper
cap
,
and
you
see
that
his
hair
be
not
thick
and
straight
,
like
Adam
's
,
but
thin
and
wavy
,
allow
you
to
discern
the
exact
contour
of
a
coronal
arch
that
predominate
very
decidedly
over
the
brow
.
  
<EOS>
the
idle
tramp
always
feel
sure
they
could
get
a
copper
from
Seth
;
they
scarcely
ever
speak
to
Adam
.
  
<EOS>
the
concert
of
the
tool
and
Adam
's
voice
be
at
last
break
by
Seth
,
who
,
lift
the
door
at
which
he
have
be
work
intently
,
place
it
against
the
wall
,
and
say
,
"

<EOS>
I

my

<EOS>
the
workman
all
look
up
;
Jim
Salt
,
a
burly
,
red
-
haired
man
know
as
Sandy
Jim
,
pause
from
his
planing
,
and
Adam
say
to
Seth
,
with
a
sharp
glance
of
surprise
,
"
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"

say
Seth
,
with

;
"

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
a
loud
roar
of
laughter
from
the
other
three
workman
make
Seth
look
round
confusedly
.
<EOS>
Adam
do
not
join
in
the
laughter
,
but
there
be
a
slight
smile
on
his
face
as
he
say
,
in
a
gentle
tone
than
before
,
"
why
,
thee'st
forget
the
panel
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
laughter
burst
out
afresh
as
Seth
clap
his
hand
to
his
head
,
and
colour
over
brow
and
crown
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hoorray

<EOS>
Ben
shake
in
Adam

iron
grasp
,
but
,
like
a
plucky
small
man
as
he
be

he
do
not
mean
to
give

<EOS>
with
his
left
hand
he
snatch
the
brush
from
his
powerless
right
,
and
make
a
movement
as
if
he
would
perform
the
feat
of
write
with
his
left

<EOS>
in
a
moment
Adam
turn
him
round
,
seize
his

push

along

Nay

Seth

lad
;
I

no

<EOS>
let
'em
follow
their
conscience
,
that
be
all

<EOS>
only
I
think
it
'
ud
be
well
if
their
conscience
'
ud
let
'em
stay
quiet
<EOS>
i
'
the
church
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
deal
to
be
learn
there
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
such
a
thing
as
be
oversperitial
;
we
must
have
something
beside
<EOS>
Gospel
i
'
this
world
.
<EOS>
look
at
the
canal
,
an
'
th
'
aqueduc
's
,
an
'
th
'
coal
-
pit
engine
,
and
Arkwright
's
mill
there
at
Cromford
;
a
man
must
learn
summat
beside
Gospel
to
make
them
thing
,
I
reckon
.
<EOS>
but
t
'
hear
some
o
'
<EOS>
them
preacher
,
you
would
think
as
a
man
must
be
do
nothing
all
be
life
but
shut
's
eye
and
look
what
be
agoe
on
inside
him
.
<EOS>
I
know
a
man
must
have
<EOS>
the
love
o
'
God
in
his
soul
,
and
the
Bible
's
God
's
word
.
<EOS>
but
what
do
the
Bible
say
?
<EOS>
why
,
it
say
as
God
put
his
sperrit
into
the
workman
as
build
the
tabernacle
,
to
make
him
do
all
the
carved
work
and
thing
as
want
a
nice
hand
.
<EOS>
and
this
be
my
way
o
'
look
at
it
:
there
be
the
sperrit
o
'
God
in
all
thing
and
all
time
 
weekday

the
Preaching
  
about
a
quarter

seven
there
be
an
unusual
appearance
of
excitement
in
the
village
of
Hayslope

and
through
the
whole
length
of
its
little
street
,
from
the
Donnithorne
Arms
to
the
churchyard
gate

the
inhabitant
have
evidently
be
draw
out
of
their
house
by
something
more
than
the
pleasure
of

<EOS>
the
Donnithorne
Arms
stand
at
the
entrance
of
the
village

farmyard

it

indicate
that
there
be
a
pretty
take

give
the

a
promise
of
good
feed
for

console
him
for
the
ignorance

<EOS>
Mr.
Casson
,
the
landlord
,
have
be
for
some
time
stand
at
the
door
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
balance
himself
on
his
heel
and
toe
and
look
towards
a
piece
of
unenclosed
ground
,
with
a
maple
in
the
middle
of
it
,
which
he
know
to
be
the
destination
of
certain
grave
-
look
man
and
woman
whom
he
have
observe
pass
at
interval
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Casson
's
person
be
by
no
means
of
that
common
type
which
can
be
allow
to
pass
without
description
.
<EOS>
on
a
front
view
it
appear
to
consist
principally
of
two
sphere
,
bear
about
the
same
relation
to
each
other
as
the
earth
and
the
moon
:
that
be
to
say
,
the
low
sphere
may
be
say
,
at
a
rough
guess
,
to
be
thirteen
time
large
than
the
upper
which
naturally
perform
the
function
of
a
mere
satellite
and
tributary
.
<EOS>
but
here
the
resemblance
cease
,
for
Mr.
Casson
's
head
be
not
at
all
a
melancholy
-
look
satellite
nor
be
it
a
"
spotty
globe
,
"
as
Milton
have
irreverently
call
the
moon
;
on
the
contrary
,
no
head
and
face
could
look
more
sleek
and
healthy
,
and
its
expression
 
which
be
chiefly
confine
to
a
pair
of
round
and
ruddy
cheek
,
the
slight
knot
and
interruption
form
the
nose
and
eye
be
scarcely
worth
<EOS>
mention
 
<EOS>
be
one
of
jolly
contentment
,
only
temper
by
that
sense
of
personal
dignity
which
usually
make
itself
feel
in
his
attitude
and
bearing
.
<EOS>
this
sense
of
dignity
could
hardly
be
consider
excessive
in
a
man
who
have
be
butl
to
"
the
family
"
for
fifteen
year
,
and
who
,
in
his
present
high
position
,
be
necessarily
very
much
in
contact
with
his
inferior
.
<EOS>
how
to
reconcile
his
dignity
with
the
satisfaction
of
his
curiosity
by
walk
towards
the
Green
be
the
problem
that
Mr.
Casson
have
be
revolve
in
his
mind
for
the
last
five
minute
;
but
when
he
have
partly
solve
it
by
take
his
hand
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
thrust
them
into
the
armhole
of
his
waistcoat
,
by
throw
his
head
on
one
side
,
and
provide
himself
with
an
air
of
contemptuous
indifference
to
whatever
may
fall
under
his
notice
,
his
thought
be
divert
by
the
approach
of
the
horseman
whom
we
lately
see
pause
to
have
another
look
at
our
friend
Adam

who
now
pull
up

<EOS>
the
traveller
put
his
horse
into
a
quick
walk
up
the
village
,
but
when
he
approach
the
Green
,
the
beauty
of
the
view
that
lie
on
his
right
hand
,
the
singular
contrast
present
by
the
group
of
villager
with
the
knot
of
Methodists
near
the
maple
,
and
perhaps
yet
more
,
curiosity
to
see
the
young
female
preacher
,
prove
too
much
for
his
anxiety
to
get
to
the
end
of
his
journey
,
and
he
pause
.
  
<EOS>
the
Green
lie
at
the
extremity

and
from
it
the
road
branch
off
in

farther
up

hill
by

winding

down

side

Green
that

the
broken
line
of
thatched
cottage
be
continue
nearly
to
the
churchyard
gate
;
but
on
the
opposite
northwestern
side
,
there
be
nothing
to
obstruct
the
view
of
gently
swell
meadow
,
and
woode
valley
,
and
dark
masse
of
distant
hill
.
<EOS>
that
rich
undulating
district
of
Loamshire
to
which
Hayslope
belong
lie
close
to
a
grim
outskirt
of
Stonyshire
,
overlook
by
its
barren
hill
as
a
pretty
blooming
sister
may
sometimes
be
see
link
in
the
arm
of
a
rugged
,
tall
,
swarthy
brother
;
and
in
two
or
three
hour

ride
the
traveller
may
exchange
a
bleak
treeless
region

intersect
by
line
of
cold
grey
stone

for
one
where
his
road
wind
under
the
shelter
of
wood
,
or
up
swell
hill
,
muffle
with
hedgerow
and
long
meadow

grass
and
thick
corn
;
and
where
at
every
turn
he
come
upon
some
fine
old
country
-
seat
nestle
in
the
valley
or
crown
the
slope
,
some
homestead
with
its
long
length
of
barn
and
its
cluster
of
golden
rick
,
some
grey
steeple
look
out
from
a
pretty
confusion
of
tree
and
thatch
and
dark
-
red
tile
.
<EOS>
It
be
just
such
a
picture
as
this
last
that
Hayslope
Church
have
make
to
the
traveller
as
he
begin
to
mount
the
gentle
slope
lead
to
its
pleasant
upland
,
and
now
from
his
station
near
the
Green
he
have
before
him
in
one
view
<EOS>
nearly
all
the
other
typical
feature
of
this
pleasant
land
.
<EOS>
high
up
against
the
horizon
be
the
huge
conical
masse
of
hill
,
like
giant
mound
intend
to
fortify
this
region
of
corn
and
grass
against
the
keen
and
hungry
wind
of
the
north
;
not
distant
enough
to
be
clothe
in
purple
mystery
,
but
with
sombre
greenish
side
visibly
speck
with
sheep
,
whose
motion
be
only
reveal
by
memory
,
not
detect
by
sight
;
woo
from
day
to
day
by
the
change
hour
,
but
respond
with
no
change
in
themselves
 
leave
for
ever
grim
and
sullen
after
the
flush
of
morning
,
the
winged
gleam
of
the
April
noonday
,
the
part
crimson
glory
of
the
ripen
summer
sun
.
<EOS>
and
directly
below
them
the
eye
rest
on
a
more
advanced
line
of
hang
wood
,
divide
by
bright
patch
of
pasture
or
furrowed
crop
,
and
not
yet
deepen
into
the
uniform
leafy
curtain
of
high
summer
,
but
still
show
the
warm
tint
of
the
young
oak
and
the
tender
green
of
the
ash
and
lime
.
<EOS>
then
come
the
valley
,
where
the
wood
grow
thick
,
as
if
they
have
roll
down
and
hurry
together
from
the
patch
leave
smooth
on
the
slope
,
that
they
may
take
the
well
care
of
the
tall
mansion
which
lift
its
parapet
and
send
its
faint
blue
summer
smoke
among
them
.
<EOS>
doubtless
there
be
a
large
sweep
of
park
and
a
broad
glassy
pool
in
front
of
that
mansion
,
but
the
swell
slope
of
meadow
would
not
let
our
traveller
see
them
from
the
village
green
.
<EOS>
He
see
instead
a
foreground
which
be
just
as
lovely
 
<EOS>
the
level
sunlight
lie
like
transparent
gold
among
the
gently
curve
stem
of
the
feather
grass
and
the
tall
red
sorrel
,
and
the
white
ambel
of
the
hemlock
line
the
bushy
hedgerow
.
<EOS>
It
be
that
moment
in
summer
when
the
sound
of
the
scythe
be
whet
make
us
cast
more
linger
look
at
the
flower
-
sprinkle
tress
of
the
meadow
.
  
<EOS>
He
may
have
see
other
beauty
in
the
landscape
if
he
have
turn
a
little
in
his
saddle
and
look
eastward
,
beyond
Jonathan
Burge
's
pasture
and
woodyard
towards
the
green
corn
-
field
and
walnut
-
tree
of
the
Hall
Farm
;
but
apparently
there
be
more
interest
for
him
in
the
live
group
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
every
generation
in
the
village
be
there
,
from
old
"
Feyther
Taft
"
in
his
brown
worst
night
-
cap
,
who
be
bent
nearly
double
,
but
seem
tough
enough
to
keep
on
his
leg
a
long
while
,
lean
on
his
short
stick
,
down
to
the
baby
with
their
little
round
head
lolling
forward
in
quilt
linen
cap
.
<EOS>
now
and
then
there
be
a
new
arrival
;
perhaps
a
slouch
labourer
,
who
,
have
eat
his
supper
,
come
out
to
look
at
the
unusual
scene
with
a
slow
bovine
gaze
,
willing
to
hear
what
any
one
have
to
say
in
explanation
of
it
,
but
by
no
mean
excite
enough
to
ask
a
question
.
<EOS>
but
all
take
care
not
to
join
the
Methodists
on
the
Green
,
and
identify
themselves
in
that
way
with
the
expectant
audience
,
for
there
be
not
one
of
them
that
would
not
have
disclaim
the
imputation
of
have
come
out
to
hear
the
"
preacher
woman
"
 
they
have
only
come
out
to
see
"
what
war
a
-
goin
'
on
,
like
.
<EOS>
"
the
man
be
chiefly
gather
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
blacksmith
's
shop
.
<EOS>
but
do
not
imagine
them
gather
in
a
knot
.
<EOS>
villager
never
swarm
:
a
whisper
be
unknown
among
them
,
and
they
seem
almost
as
incapable
of
an
undertone
as
a
cow
or
a
stag
.
<EOS>
Your
true
rustic
turn
his
back
on
his
interlocutor
,
throw
a
question
over
his
shoulder
as
if
he
mean
to
run
away
from
the
answer
,
and
walk
a
step
or
two
farther
off
when
the
interest
of
the
dialogue
culminate
.
<EOS>
so
the
group
in
the
vicinity
of
the
blacksmith
's
door
be
by
no
mean
a
close
one
,
and
form
no
screen
in
front
of
Chad
Cranage
,
the
blacksmith
himself
,
who
stand
with
his
black
brawny
arm
fold
,
lean
against
the
door
-
post
,
and
occasionally
send
forth
a
bellowing
laugh
at
his
own
joke
,
give
them
a
marked
preference
over
the
sarcasm
of
Wiry
Ben
,
who
have
renounce
the
pleasure
of
the
Holly
Bush
for
the
sake
of
see
life
under
a
new
form
.
<EOS>
but
both
style
of
wit
be

with
equal
contempt
by
Mr.
Joshua
Rann
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rann
's
leathern
apron
and
subdue
griminess
can
leave
no
one
in
any
doubt
that
he
be
the
village
shoemaker
;
<EOS>
the
thrusting
out
of
his
chin
and
stomach
and
the
twirling
of
his
thumb
be
more
subtle
indication
,
intend
to
prepare
unwary
stranger
for
the
discovery
that
they
be
in
the
presence
of
the
parish
clerk

indignation

but
he
have
not
yet
open
his
lip
except
to
say
,
in
a

bass
undertone

a
quotation
which
may
seem
to
have
slight
bearing
on
the
present
occasion
,
but
,
as
with
every
other
anomaly
,
adequate
knowledge
will
show
it
to
be
a
natural
sequence

<EOS>
Mr.
Rann
be
inwardly
maintain
the
dignity
of
the
Church
in
the
face
of
this
scandalous
irruption
of
Methodism
,
and
as
that
dignity
be
bind
up
with
his
own
sonorous
utterance
of
the
response
,
his
argument
naturally
suggest
a
quotation
from
the
psalm
he
have
read
the
last
Sunday
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
the
strong
curiosity
of
the
woman
have
draw
them
quite
to
the
edge
of

Green

rather
quickly

short

when

away
from

she
seem
above
the
middle
height
of
woman

though
in
reality
she
do
not
exceed
it
 
an
effect
which
be
due

the

not

at

He
have
make
up
his

to
see

advance
with

measure
step

countenance

have
feel
sure

Dinah
walk
as
simply
as

unconscious

hang
down
lightly
cross
before

as
she
stand

turn
her
grey
eye
on
the
people

<EOS>
there
be
no
keenness
in

they

the

in

the
delicate
colouring

gather
a

vividness

arch

nothing

one
of
those
face

light
touch

colour

pure
petal

<EOS>
the
eye
have
no

that
man
of
God
be
Mr.
Wesley
,
who
spend
his
life
in
do
what
our
bless
Lord
do
 
preach
the
Gospel
to
the
poor
 
<EOS>
and
he
enter
into
his
rest
eight
year
ago
.
<EOS>
I
come
to
know
more
about
him
year
after
,
but
I
be
a
foolish
thoughtless
child
then
,
and
I
remember
only
one
thing
he
tell
us
in
his
sermon
.
<EOS>
He
tell
us
as
"
Gospel
"
mean
"
good
news
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Gospel
,
you
know
,
be
what
the
Bible
tell
us
about
God
.
  
<EOS>
"
think
of
that
now
!
<EOS>
Jesus
Christ
do
really
come
down
from
heaven
,
as
I
,
like
a
silly
child
,
think
Mr.
Wesley
do
;
and
what
he
come
down
for
be
to
tell
good
news
about
God
to
the
poor
.
<EOS>
why
,
you
and
me
,
dear
friend
,
be
poor
.
<EOS>
We
have
be
bring
up
in
poor
cottage
and
have
be
rear
on
oat
-
cake
,
and
live
coarse
;
and
we
have
not
be
to
school
much
,
nor
read
book
,
and
we
do
not
know
much
about
anything
<EOS>
but
what
happen
just
round
us
.
<EOS>
We
be
just
the
sort
of
people
that
want
to
hear
good
news
.
<EOS>
for
when
anybody
be
well
off
,
they
do
not
much
mind
about
hear
news
from
distant
part
;
but
if
a
poor
man
or
woman
be
in
trouble
and
have
hard
work
to
make
out
a
living
,
they
like
to
have
a
letter
to
tell
'em
they
have
get
a
friend
as
will
help
'em
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
we
can
not
help
know
something
about
God
,
even
if
we
have
never
hear
the
Gospel
,
the
good
news
that
our
Saviour
bring
us
.
<EOS>
for
we
know
everything
come
from
God
:
do
not
you
say
almost
every
day
,
"
this
and
that
will
happen
,
please
God
,
"
and
<EOS>
"
We
shall
begin
to
cut
the
grass
soon
,
please
God
to
send
us
a
little
more
sunshine
"
?
<EOS>
We
know
very
well
we
be
altogether
in
the
hand
of
God
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
bring
ourselves
into
the
world
,
we
can
not
keep
ourselves
alive
while
we
be
sleep
;
the
daylight
,
and
the
wind
,
and
the
corn
,
and
the
cow
to
give
us
milk
 
<EOS>
everything
we
have
come
from
God
.
<EOS>
and
he
give
us
our
soul
and
put
love
between
parent
and
child
,
and
husband
and
wife
.
<EOS>
but
be
that
as
much
as
we
want
to
know
about
God
?
<EOS>
We
see
he
be
great
and
mighty
,
and
can
do
what
he
will
:
we
be
lose
,
as
if
we
be
struggle
in
great
water
,
when
we
try
to
think
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
perhaps
doubt
come
into
your
mind
like
this
:
Can
God
take
much
notice
of
us
poor
people
?
<EOS>
perhaps
he
only
make
the
world
for
the
great
and
the
wise
and
the
rich
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
cost
him
much
to
give
us
our
little
handful
of
victual
and
bit
of
clothing
;
but
how
do
we
know
he
care
for
us
any
more
than
we
care
for
the
worm
and
thing
in
the
garden
,
so
as
we
rear
our
carrot
and
onion
?
<EOS>
Will
God
take
care
of
us
when
we
die
?
<EOS>
and
have
he
any
comfort
for
us
when
we
be
lame
and
sick
and
helpless
?
<EOS>
perhaps
,
too
,
he
be
angry
with
us
;
else
why
do
the
blight
come
,
and
the
bad
harvest
,
and
the
fever
,
and
all
sort
of
pain
and
trouble
?
<EOS>
for
our
life
be
full
of
trouble
,
and
if
God
send
us
good
,
he
seem
to
send
bad
too
.
<EOS>
how
be
it
?
<EOS>
how
be
it
?
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
dear
friend
,
we
be
in
sad
want
of
good
news
about
God
;
and
what
do
other
good
news
signify
if
we
have
not
that
?
<EOS>
for
everything
else
come
to
an
end
,
and
when
we
die
we
leave
it
all
.
<EOS>
but
God
last
when
everything
else
be
go
.
<EOS>
what
shall
we
do
if
he
be
not
our
friend
?
"
  
<EOS>
then
Dinah
tell
how
the
good
news
have
be
bring
,
and
how
the
mind
of
God
towards
the
poor
have
be
make
manifest
in
the
life
of
Jesus
,
dwell
on
its
lowliness
and
its
act
of
mercy
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
you
see
,
dear
friend
,
"
she
go
on
,
"
Jesus
spend
his
time
almost
all
in
do
good
to
poor
people
;
he
preach
out
of
door
to
them
,
and
he
make
friend
of
poor
workman
,
and
teach
them
and
take
pain
with
them
.
<EOS>
not
but
what
he
do
good
to
the
rich
too
,
for
he
be
full
of
love
to
all
man
,
only
he
see
as
the
poor
be
more
in
want
of
his
help
.
<EOS>
so
he
cure
the
lame
and
the
sick
and
the
blind
,
and
he
work
miracle
to
feed
the
hungry
because
,
he
say
,
he
be
sorry
for
them
;
and
he
be
very
kind
to
the
little
child
and
comfort
those
who
have
lose
their
friend
;
and
he
speak
very
tenderly
to
poor
sinner
that
be
sorry
for
their
sin
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
would
not
you
love
such
a
man
if
you
see
him
 
if
he
be
here
in
this
village
?
<EOS>
what
a
kind
heart
he
must
have
!
<EOS>
what
a
friend
he
would
be
to
go
to
in
trouble
!
<EOS>
how
pleasant
it
must
be
to
be
teach
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
dear
friend
,
who
be
this
man
?
<EOS>
be
he
only
a
good
man
 
a
very
good
man
,
and
no
more
 
like
our
dear
Mr.
Wesley
,
who
have
be
take
from
us?
...
<EOS>
He
be
the
Son
of
God
 
"
in
the
image
of
the
Father
,
"
the
Bible
say
;
<EOS>
that
mean
,
just
like
God
,
who
be
the
beginning
and
end
of
all
thing
 
<EOS>
the
God
we
want
to
know
about
.
<EOS>
so
then
,
all
the
love
that
Jesus
show
to
the
poor
be
the
same
love
that
God
have
for
us
.
<EOS>
We
can
understand
what
Jesus
feel
,
because
he
come
in
a
body
like
ours
and
speak
word
such
as
we
speak
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
We
be
afraid
to
think
what
God
be
before
 
<EOS>
the
God
who
make
the
world
and
the
sky
and
the
thunder
and
lightning
.
<EOS>
We
could
never
see
him
;
we
could
only
see
the
thing
he
have
make
;
and
some
of
these
thing
be
very
terrible
,
so
as
we
may
well
tremble
when
we
think
of
him
.
<EOS>
but
our
bless
Saviour
have
show
us
what
God
be
in
a
way
us
poor
ignorant
people
can
understand
;
he
have
show
us
what
God
's
heart
be
,
what
be
his
feeling
towards
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
let
us
see
a
little
more
about
what
Jesus
come
on
earth
for
.
<EOS>
another
time
he
say
,
"
I
come
to
seek
and
to
save
that
which
be
lose
"
;
and
another
time
,
"
I
come
not
to
call
the
righteous
but
sinner
to
repentance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
LOST!
...
<EOS>
sinners!
...
<EOS>
ah
,
dear
friend
,
do
that
mean
you
and
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
the
traveller
have
be
chain
to
the
spot
against
his
will
by
the
charm
of
Dinah
's
mellow
treble
tone
,
which
have
a
variety
of
modulation
like
that
of
a
fine
instrument
touch
with
the
unconscious
skill
of
musical
instinct
.
<EOS>
the
simple
thing
she
say
seem
like
novelty
,
as
a
melody
strike
us
with
a
new
feeling
when
we
hear
it
sing
by
the
pure
voice
of
a
boyish
chorister
;
the
quiet
depth
of
conviction
with
which
she
speak
seem
in
itself
an
evidence
for
the
truth
of
her
message
.
<EOS>
He
see
that
she
have
thoroughly
arrest
her
hearer
.
<EOS>
the
villager
have
press
nearer
to
her
,
and
there
be
no
longer
anything
but
grave
attention
on
all
face
.
<EOS>
She
speak
slowly
,
though
quite
fluently
,
often
pause
after
a
question
,
or
before
any
transition
of
idea
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
change
of
attitude
,
no
gesture
;
the
effect
of
her
speech
be
produce
entirely
by
the
inflection
of
her
voice
,
and
when
she
come
to
the
question
,
"
Will
God
take
care
of
us
when
we
die
?
<EOS>
"
she
utter
it
in
such
a
tone
of
plaintive
appeal
that
the
tear
come
into
some
of
the
hard
eye
.
<EOS>
the
stranger
have
cease
to
doubt
,
as
he
have
do
at
the
first
glance
,
that
she
could
fix
the
attention
of
her
rough
hearer
,
but
still
he
wonder
whether
she
could
have
that
power
of
rouse
their
more
violent
emotion
,
which
must
surely
be
a
necessary
seal
of
her
vocation
as
a
Methodist
preacher
,
until
she
come
to
the
word
,
"
lose
!
 
<EOS>
sinner
!
<EOS>
"
when
there
be
a
great
change
in
her
voice
and
manner
.
<EOS>
She
have
make
a
long
pause
before
the
exclamation
,
and
the
pause
seem
to
be
fill
by
agitate
thought
that
show
themselves
in
her
feature
.
<EOS>
Her
pale
face
become
paler
;
the
circle
under
her
eye
deepen
,
as
they
do
when
tear
half
-
gather
without
fall
;
and
the
mild
loving
eye
take
an
expression
of
appal
pity
,
as
if
she
have
suddenly
discern
a
destroy
angel
hover
over
the
head
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
Her
voice
become
deep
and
muffled
,
but
there
be
still
no
gesture
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
less
like
the
ordinary
type
of
the
Ranter
than
Dinah
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
preach
as
she
hear
other
preach
,
but
speak
directly
from
her
own
emotion
and
under
the
inspiration
of
her
own
simple
faith
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
she
have
enter
into
a
new
current
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
become
less
calm
,
her
utterance
more
rapid
and
agitate
,
as
she
try
to
bring
home
to
the
people
their
guilt
,
their
wilful
darkness
,
their
state
of
disobedience
to
God
 
as
she
dwell
on
the
hatefulness
of
sin
,
the
divine
holiness
,
and
the
suffering
of
the
Saviour
,
by
which
a
way
have
be
open
for
their
salvation
.
<EOS>
at
last
it
seem
as
if
,
in
her
yearning
desire
to
reclaim
the
lost
sheep
,
she
could
not
be
satisfy
by
address
her
hearer
as
a
body
.
<EOS>
She
appeal
first
to
one
and
then
to
another
,
beseech
them
with
tear
to
turn
to
God
while
there
be
yet
time
;
paint
to
them
the
desolation
of
their
soul
,
lose
in
sin
,
feed
on
the
husk
of
this
miserable
world
,
far
away
from
God
their
Father
;
and
then
the
love
of
the
Saviour
,
who
be
wait
and
watch
for
their
return
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
many
a
responsive
sigh
and
groan
from
her
fellow
-
Methodists
,
but
the
village
mind
do
not
easily
take
fire
,
and
a
little
smoulder
vague
anxiety
that
may
easily
die
out
again
be
the
utmost
effect
Dinah
's
preaching
have
work
in
them
at
present
.
<EOS>
yet
no
one
have
retire
,
except
the
child
and
"
old
Feyther
Taft
,
"
who
be
too
deaf
to
catch
many
word
,
have
some
time
ago
go
back
to
his
inglenook
.
<EOS>
Wiry
Ben
be
feel
very
uncomfortable
,
and
almost
wish
he
have
not
come
to
hear
Dinah
;
he
think
what
she
say
would
haunt
him
somehow
.
<EOS>
yet
he
could
not
help
like
to
look
at
her
and
listen
to
her
,
though
he
dread
every
moment
that
she
would
fix
her
eye
on
him
and
address
him
in
particular
.
<EOS>
She
have
already
address
Sandy
Jim
,
who
be
now
hold
the
baby
to
relieve
his
wife
,
and
the
big
soft
-
hearted
man
have
rub
away
some
tear
with
his
fist
,
with
a
confused
intention
of
be
a
well
fellow
,
go
less
to
the
Holly
Bush
down
by
the
Stone
-
pit
,
and
clean
himself
more
regularly
of
a
Sunday
.
  
<EOS>
in
front
of
Sandy
Jim
stand
Chad
's
Bess
,
who
have
show
an
unwonted
quietude
and
fixity
of
attention
ever
since
Dinah
have
begin
to
speak
.
<EOS>
not
that
the
matter
of
the
discourse
have
arrest
her
at
once
,
for
she
be
lose
in
a
puzzling
speculation
as
to
what
pleasure
and
satisfaction
there
could
be
in
life
to
a
young
woman
who
wear
a
cap
like
Dinah
's
.
<EOS>
give
up
this
inquiry
in
despair
,
she
take
to
study
Dinah
's
nose
,
eye
,
mouth
,
and
hair
,
and
wonder
whether
it
be
well
to
have
such
a
sort
of
pale
face
as
that
,
or
fat
red
cheek
and
round
black
eye
like
her
own
.
<EOS>
but
gradually
the
influence
of
the
general
gravity
tell
upon
her
,
and
she
become
conscious
of
what
Dinah
be
say
.
<EOS>
the
gentle
tone
,
the
loving
persuasion
,
do
not
touch
her
,
but
when
the
more
severe
appeal
come
she
begin
to
be
frighten
.
<EOS>
Poor
Bessy
have
always
be
consider
a
naughty
girl
;
she
be
conscious
of
it
;
if
it
be
necessary
to
be
very
good
,
it
be
clear
she
must
be
in
a
bad
way
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
find
her
place
at
church
as
Sally
Rann
could
,
she
have
often
be
titter
when
she
"
curcheye
"
to
Mr.
Irwine
;
and
these
religious
deficiency
be
accompany
by
a
corresponding
slackness
in
the
minor
moral
,
for
Bessy
belong
unquestionably
to
that
unsoaped
lazy
class
of
feminine
character
with
whom
you
may
venture
to
"
eat
an
egg
,
an
apple
,
or
a
nut
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
all
this
she
be
generally
conscious
of
,
and
hitherto
have
not
be
greatly
ashamed
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
now
she
begin
to
feel
very
much
as
if
the
constable
have
come
to
take
her
up
and
carry
her
before
the
justice
for
some
undefined
offence
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
terrified
sense
that
God
,
whom
she
have
always
think
of
as
very
far
off
,
be
very
near
to
her
,
and
that
Jesus
be
close
by
look
at
her
,
though
she
could
not
see
him
.
<EOS>
for
Dinah
have
that
belief
in
visible
manifestation
of
Jesus
,
which
be
common
among
the
Methodists
,
and
she
communicate
it
irresistibly
to
her
hearer
<EOS>
:
she
make
them
feel
that
he
be
among
them
bodily
,
and
may
at
any
moment
show
himself
to
them
in
some
way
that
would
strike
anguish
and
penitence
into
their
heart
.

see

upon

him
up

His

Dinah
have
be
speak
at

an
hour

the
redden
light
of
the
part
day
seem
to
give
a
solemn
emphasis
to
her
closing
word

<EOS>
the
stranger
,
who
have
be
interested
in
the
course
of
her
sermon
as
if
it
have
be
the
development

there
be
this
sort
of
fascination
in
all
sincere
unpremeditated
eloquence

which
open
to
one
the
inward
drama
of
the
speaker
's
emotion
 
now
turn
his
horse
aside
and
pursue
his
way
,
while
Dinah
say
,
"
let
us
sing
a
little
,
dear

;
and
as
he
be
still
wind
down
the
slope
,
the
voice
of
the
Methodists
reach
him
,
rise
and
fall
in
that
strange
blending
of
exultation

sadness

belong

the
cadence

after
the
Preaching
  
in

than
an
hour
from

Seth

by

skirt
the

green
corn

field

Dinah
have
take
off
her
little
Quaker
bonnet
again
,
and
be
hold
it
in
her
hand
that
she
may
have
a
free
enjoyment
of
the
cool
evening
twilight

and
Seth
could
see
the
expression
of
her
face
quite
clearly
as
he
walk
by
her
side
,
timidly
revolve
something
he
want
to
say
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
expression
of
unconscious
placid
gravity
 
of
absorption
in
thought
that
have
no
connection
with
the
present
moment
or
with
her
own
personality
 
an
expression
that
be
most
of
all
discourage
to
a
lover
.
<EOS>
Her
very
walk
be
discouraging
:
it
have
that
quiet
elasticity
that
ask
for
no
support
.
<EOS>
Seth
feel
this
dimly
;
he
say
to
himself
,
"
She
be
too
good
and
holy
for
any
man
,
let
alone
me
,
"
and
the
word
he
have
be
summon
rush
back
again
before
they
have
reach
his
lip
.
<EOS>
but
another
thought
give
him
courage
:
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
man
could
love
her
well
and
leave
her
free
to
follow
the
Lord
's
work

<EOS>
"
They
have
be
silent
for
many
minute
now
,
since
they
have
do
talk
about
Bessy
Cranage
;
Dinah
seem
almost
to
have
forget
Seth
's
presence
,
and
her
pace
be
become
so
much
quicker
that
the
sense
of
their
be
only
a
few
minute
'
walk
from
the
yard
-
gate
of
the
Hall
Farm
at
last
give
Seth
courage
to
speak
.

"
You

<EOS>

quietly

bear
in

meditate
on
Sunday
night

as
Sister
Allen

who
be
in
a
decline

be
in
need

I
see
her
as
plain
as
we
see
that
bit
of
thin
white
cloud

lift
up
her
poor
thin
hand
and
beckon
to
me

and
this
morning
when
I
open
the
Bible
for
direction

the
first
word
my
eye
fall
on
be
,
"
<EOS>
and
after
we
have
see
the
vision

immediately
we

go
into
Macedonia

if
it
be
not
for
that
clear
showing

yearn
over
my

her
little

and
that
poor
wander
lamb
Hetty
Sorrel

<EOS>
I
have
be
much
draw
out
in
prayer
for
her
of
late

I
look
on
it
as
a
token
that
there
may
be
mercy
in
store
for
her

"
  
<EOS>
"
God
grant
it

Seth

for
I
doubt
Adam

heart
be
so
set
on
her
,
he
will
never
turn
to
anybody
else
;
and
yet
it
'
ud
go
to
my
heart
if
he
be
to
marry
her

for
I
canna

as
she
would
make

happy

It
be
a
deep
mystery
 
<EOS>
the
way
the
heart
of
man
turn
to
one
woman
out
of
all
the
rest
he
be
see
i

the
world
,
and
make
it
easy
for
him
to
work
seven
year
for
HER
,
like
Jacob
do
for
Rachel
,
sooner
than
have
any
other
woman
for

asking

<EOS>
I
often
think
of
them
word
,
"
and
Jacob
serve
seven
year
for
Rachel
;
and
they
seem
to
him
but
a
few
day
for
the
love
he
have
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
those
word

come
true
with

if
so
be
you
would
give
me
hope
as
I
may
win
you
after
seven
year
be
over

<EOS>
I
know
you
think
a
husband
'
ud
be
take
up
too
much
o

your
thought
,
because
St.
Paul
say
,
"
She
that
be
married
careth
for
the
thing
of
the
world
how
she
may
please
her
husband

and
may
happen
you
will
think
me
overbold
to
speak
to
you
about
it
again
,
after
what
you
tell
me
o
'
<EOS>
your
mind
last
Saturday
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
be
think
it
over
again
by
night
and
by
day
,
and
I
have
pray
not
to
be
blind
by
my
own
desire
,
to
think
what
be
only
good
for
me
must
be
good
for
you
too

<EOS>
and
it
seem
to
me
there
be
more
text
for
your
marrying
than
ever
you
can
find
against
it
.
<EOS>
for
St.
Paul
say
as
plain
as
can
be
in
another
place
,
"
I
will
that
the
young
woman
marry
,
bear
child
,
guide
the
house
,
give
none
occasion
to
the
adversary
to
speak
reproachfully
"

and
then
"
two
be
well
than
one
"
;
and
that
hold
good
with
marriage
as
well
as
with
other
thing

<EOS>
for
we
should
be
o

one
heart

one
mind
,
Dinah

<EOS>
We
both
serve
the
same
Master
,
and
be
strive
after
the
same
gift

and
I
would
never
be
the
husband
to
make
a
claim
on
you
as
could
interfere
with
your
do
the
work
God
have
fit
you
for

<EOS>
I
would
make
a
shift
,
and
fend
indoor
and
out
,
to
give
you
more
liberty
 
more
than
you
can
have
now
,
for
you
have
get
to
get
your
own
living
now
,
and
I
be
strong
enough
to
work
for
us
both

"
  
<EOS>
when
Seth
have
once
begin
to
urge
his
suit
,
he
go
on
earnestly
and
almost
hurriedly
,
lest
Dinah
should
speak
some
decisive
word
before
he
have
pour
forth
all
the
argument
he
have
prepare
.
<EOS>
His
cheek
become
flushed
as
he
go
on
his

<EOS>
They
have
reach
one
of
those
very
narrow
pass
between
two
tall
stone
,
which
perform
the
office
of
a
stile
in
Loamshire
,
and
Dinah
pause
as
she
turn
towards
Seth
and
say
,
in
her
tender
but
calm
treble
note
,
"
Seth
Bede
,
I
thank
you
for
your
love
towards
me
,
and
if
I
could
think
of
any
man
as
more
than
a
christian
brother
,
I
think
it
would
be
you
.
<EOS>
but
my
heart
be
not
free
to
marry
.
<EOS>
that
be
good
for
other
woman
,
and
it
be
a
great
and
a
bless
thing
to
be
a
wife
and
mother
;
but
"
as
God
have
distribute
to
every
man
,
as
the
Lord
hath
call
every
man
,
so
let
him
walk
.
<EOS>
"
God
have
call
me
to
minister
to
other
,
not
to
have
any
joy
or
sorrow
of
my
own
,
but
to
rejoice
with
them
that
do
rejoice
,
and
to
weep
with
those
that
weep
.
<EOS>
He
have
call
me
to
speak
his
word
,
and
he
have
greatly
own
my
work
.
<EOS>
It
could
only
be
on
a
very
clear
showing
that
I
could
leave
the
brother
and
sister
at
Snowfield
,
who
be
favour
with
very
little
of
this
world
's
good
;
where
the
tree
be
few
,
so
that
a
child
may
count
them
,
and
there
be
very
hard
live
for
the
poor
in
the
winter
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
give
me
to
help
,
to
comfort
,
and
strengthen
the
little
flock
there
and
to
call
in
many
wanderer
;
and
my
soul
be
fill
with
these
thing
from
my
rise
up
till
my
lie
down
.
<EOS>
My
life
be
too
short
,
and
God
's
work
be
too
great
for
me
to
think
of
make
a
home
for
myself
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
your
word
,
Seth
,
<EOS>
for
when
I
see
as
your
love
be
give
to
me
,
I
think
it
may
be
a
leading
of
Providence
for
me
to
change
my
way
of
life
,
and
that
we
should
be
fellow
-
helper
;
and
I
spread
the
matter
before
the
Lord
.
<EOS>
but
whenever
I
try
to
fix
my
mind
on
marriage
,
and
our
live
together
,
other
thought
always
come
in
 
the
time
when
I
have
pray
by
the
sick
and
die
,
and
the
happy
hour
I
have
have
preach
,
when
my
heart
be
fill
with
love
,
and
the
Word
be
give
to
me
abundantly
.
<EOS>
and
when
I
have
open
the
Bible
for
direction
,
I
have
always
light
on
some
clear
word
to
tell
me
where
my
work
lie
.
<EOS>
I
believe
what
you
say
,
Seth
,
that
you
would
try
to
be
a
help
and
not
a
hindrance
to
my
work
;
but
I
see
that
our
marriage
be
not
God
's
will
 
<EOS>
He
draw
my
heart
another
way
.
<EOS>
I
desire
to
live
and
die
without
husband
or
child
.
<EOS>
I
seem
to
have
no
room
in
my
soul
for
want
and
fear
of
my
own
,
it
have
please
God
to
fill
my
heart
so
full
with
the
want
and
suffering
of
his
poor
people
.
"
  
<EOS>
Seth
be
unable
to
reply
,
and
they
walk
on
in
silence
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
as
they
be
nearly
at
the
yard
-
gate
,
he
say
,
"
well
,
Dinah
,
I
must
seek
for
strength
to
bear
it
,
and
to
endure
as
see
Him
who
be
invisible
.
<EOS>
but
I
feel
now
how
weak
my
faith
be
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
,
when
you
be
go
,
I
could
never
joy
in
anything
any
more
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
something
pass
the
love
of
woman
as
I
feel
for
you
,
for
I
could
be
content
without
your
marry
me
if
I
could
go
and
live
at
Snowfield
and
be
near
you
.
<EOS>
I
trust
as
the
strong
love
God
have
give
me
towards
you
<EOS>
be
a
leading
for
us
both
;
but
it
seem
it
be
only
mean
for
my
trial
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
feel
more
for
you
than
I
ought
to
feel
for
any
creature
,
for
I
often
can
not
help
say
of
you
what
the
hymn
say
         
<EOS>
in
darkest
shade
if
she
appear
,
     
My
dawning
be
begin
;
     
She
be
my
soul
's
bright
morning
-
star
,
     
<EOS>
and
she
my
rise
sun
.
  
<EOS>
that
may
be
wrong
,
and
I
be
to
be
teach
better
.
<EOS>
but
you
would
not
be
displeased
with
me
if
thing
turn
out
so
as
I
could
leave
this
country
and
go
to
live
at
Snowfield
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
Seth
;
but
I
counsel
you
to
wait
patiently
,
and
not
lightly
to
leave
your
own
country
and
kindre
.
<EOS>
do
nothing
without
the
Lord
's
clear
bidding
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
bleak
and
barren
country
there
,
not
like
this
land
of
Goshen
you
have
be
use
to
.
<EOS>
We
must
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
fix
and
choose
our
own
lot
;
we
must
wait
to
be
guide
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
would
let
me
write
you
a
letter
,
Dinah
,
if
there
be
anything
I
want
to
tell
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sure
;
let
me
know
if
you
be
in
any
trouble
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
continually
in
my
prayer
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
have
now
reach
the
yard
-
gate
,
and
Seth
say
,
"
I
will
not
go
in
,
Dinah
,
so
farewell
.
"
<EOS>
He
pause
and
hesitate
after
she
have
give
him
her
hand
,
and
then
say
,
"
there
be
no
knowing
but
what
you
may
see
thing
different
after
a
while
.
<EOS>
there
may
be
a
new
leading
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
us
leave
that
,
Seth
.
<EOS>
It
be
good
to
live
only
a
moment
at
a
time
,
as
I
have
read
in
one
of
Mr.
Wesley
's
book
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
for
you
and
me
to
lay
plan
;
we
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
obey
and
to
trust
.
<EOS>
farewell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
press
his
hand
with
rather
a
sad
look
in
her
loving
eye
,
and
then
pass
through
the
gate
,
while
Seth
turn
away
to
walk
lingeringly
home
.
<EOS>
but
instead
of
take
the
direct
road
,
he
choose
to
turn
back
along
the
field
through
which
he
and
Dinah
have
already
pass
;
and
I
think
his
blue
linen
handkerchief
be
very
wet
with
tear
long
before
he
have
make
up
his
mind
that
it
be
time
for
him
to
set
his
face
steadily
homeward
.
<EOS>
He
be
but
three
-
and
-
twenty
,
and
have
only
just
learn
what
it
be
to
love
 
to
love
with
that
adoration
which
a
young
man
give
to
a
woman
whom
he
feel
to
be
great
and
well
than
himself
.
<EOS>
love
of
this
sort
be
hardly
distinguishable
from
religious
feeling
.
<EOS>
what
deep
and
worthy
love
be
so
,
whether
of
woman
or
child
,
or
art
or
music
.
<EOS>
Our
caress
,
our
tender
word
,
our
still
rapture
under
the
influence
of
autumn
sunset
,
or
pillare
vista
,
or
calm
majestic
statue
,
or
Beethoven
symphony
all
bring
with
them
the
consciousness
that
they
be
mere
wave
and
ripple
in
an
unfathomable
ocean
of
love
and
beauty
;
our
emotion
in
its
keen
moment
pass
from
expression
into
silence
,
our
love
at
its
high
flood
rush
beyond
its
object
and
lose
itself
in
the
sense
of
divine
mystery
.
<EOS>
and
this
blessed
gift
of
venerate
love
have
be
give
to
too
many
humble
craftsman
since
the
world
begin
for
us
to
feel
any
surprise
that
it
should
have
exist
in
the
soul
of
a
Methodist
carpenter
half
a
century
ago
,
while
there
be
yet
a
lingering
after
-
glow
from
the
time
when
Wesley
and
his
fellow
-
labourer
feed
on
the
hip
and
haw
of
the
Cornwall
hedge
,
after
exhaust
limb
and
lung
in
carry
a
divine
message
to
the
poor
.
  
<EOS>
that
afterglow
have
long
fade
away
;
and
the
picture
we
be
apt
to
make
of
Methodism
in
our
imagination
be
not
an
amphitheatre
of
green
hill
,
or
the
deep
shade
of
broad
-
leaved
sycamore
,
where
a
crowd
of
rough
man
and
weary
-
hearted
woman
drink
in
a
faith
which
be
a
rudimentary
culture
,
which
link
their
thought
with
the
past
,
lift
their
imagination
above
the
sordid
detail
of
their
own
narrow
life
,
and
suffuse
their
soul
with
the
sense
of
a
pitying
,
love
,
infinite
Presence
,
sweet
as
summer
to
the
houseless
needy
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
possible
that
to
some
of
my
reader
Methodism
may
mean
nothing
more
than
low
-
pitch
gable
up
dingy
street
,
sleek
grocer
,
sponging
preacher
,
and
hypocritical
jargon
 
element
which
be
regard
as
an
exhaustive
analysis
of
Methodism
in
many
fashionable
quarter
.
  
<EOS>
that
would
be
a
pity
;
for
I
can
not
pretend
that
Seth
and
Dinah
be
anything
else
than
methodist
 
not
indeed
of
that
modern
type
which
read
quarterly
review
and
attend
in
chapel
with
pillare
portico
,
but
of
a
very
old
-
fashioned
kind
.
<EOS>
They
believe
in
present
miracle
,
in
instantaneous
conversion
,
in
revelation
by
dream
and
vision
;
they
draw
lot
,
and
seek
for
divine
guidance
by
open
the
Bible
at
hazard
;
have
a
literal
way
of
interpret
the
scripture
,
which
be
not
at
all
sanction
by
approve
commentator
;
and
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
represent
their
diction
as
correct
,
or
their
instruction
as
liberal
.
<EOS>
still
 
if
I
have
read
religious
history
aright
 
faith
,
hope
,
and
charity
have
not
always
be
find
in
a
direct
ratio
with
a
sensibility
to
the
three
concord
,
and
it
be
possible
 
thank
Heaven
!
 
<EOS>
to
have
very
erroneous
theory
and
very
sublime
feeling
.
<EOS>
the
raw
bacon
which
clumsy
Molly
spare
from
her
own
scanty
store
that
she
may
carry
it
to
her
neighbour
's
child
to
"
stop
the
fit
,
"
may
be
a
piteously
inefficacious
remedy
;
but
the
generous
stirring
of
neighbourly
kindness
that
prompt
the
deed
have
a
beneficent
radiation
that
be
not
lose
.
  
<EOS>
consider
these
thing
,
we
can
hardly
think
Dinah
and
Seth
beneath
our
sympathy
,
accustom
as
we
may
be
to
weep
over
the
lofty
sorrow
of
heroine
in
satin
boot
and
crinoline
,
and
of
hero
ride
fiery

themselves
ride

still

fiery

Poor
Seth
!
<EOS>
He
be
never
on
horseback
in
his
life
except
once
,
when
he
be
a
little
lad
,
and
Mr.
Jonathan
Burge
take
him
up
behind
,
tell
him
to
"
hold
on

"
;
and
instead
of
burst
out
into
wild
accusing
apostrophe
to
God
and
destiny
,
he
be
resolve
,
as
he
now
walk
homeward
under
the
solemn
starlight
,
to
repress
his
sadness
,
to
be
less
bent
on
have
his
own

She

Her

Nature

by
our

We

long

the

to
whom
we

our

the
mechanical

keen
sensibility
to
harmony

the
unconscious

of
the

Lisbeth
dare
not

more
;

she
get
up
and

think
to
console
herself
somewhat
for
Adam

refusal
of

she
have
spread
out
in
the
loving
expectation
of
look
at

eat

by
feed

extra
liberality

but
Gyp
be
watch
his
master
with
wrinkle
brow
and
ear
erect

puzzle
at
this
unusual
course

thing

and
though
he
glance
at

she
call
him

move
his
fore

paw
uneasily

<EOS>
well

remain
seated
on

again
fix
his

anxiously
on

notice
Gyp

mental
conflict

though
his
anger
have
make
him
less
tender
than

it
do
not

him
from

satisfy

no

lick
up
his

he
go
back
to

while
Lisbeth
sit
down
alone
to
cry
over
her
knitting
.
<EOS>
woman
who
be
never
bitter
and
resentful
be
often
the
most
querulous
;
and
if
Solomon
be
as
wise
as
he
be
repute
to
be
,
I
feel
sure
that
when
he
compare
a
contentious
woman
to
a
continual
dropping
on
a
very
rainy
day
,
he
have
not
a
vixen
in
his
eye
 
a
fury
with
long
nail
,
acrid
and
selfish
.
<EOS>
depend
upon
it
,
he
mean
a
good
creature
,
who
have
no
joy
but
in
the
happiness
of
the
love
one
whom
she
contribute
to
make
uncomfortable
,
put
by
all
the
tid
-
bit
for
them
and
spend
nothing
on
herself
.
<EOS>
such
a
woman
as
Lisbeth
,
for
example
 
at
once
patient
and
complaining
,
self

renounce
and
exact
,
brood
the
livelong
day
over
what
happen
yesterday
and
what
be
likely
to
happen
to

morrow
,
and
cry
very
readily
both
at
the
good
and
the
evil

<EOS>
but
a
certain
awe
mingle
itself
with
her
idolatrous
love
of
Adam
,
and
when
he
say
,
"
leave
me
alone
,
"
she
be
always
silence
.
  
<EOS>
so
the
hour
pass
,
to
the
loud
ticking
of
the
old
day

clock
and
the
sound
of
Adam
's
tool

<EOS>
at
last
he
call
for
a
light
and
a
draught
of
water
<EOS>
(
beer
be
a
thing
only

Lisbeth
venture

He
have
work
off
his
anger
now

and
whenever
he
wish
to
be
especially
kind
to
his
mother
,
he
fall
into
his
strong
native
accent

dialect

<EOS>
with
which
at

his

Lisbeth
,
though
dispose
always
to
take
the
negative
side
in
her
conversation
with

have
a
vague
sense
that
there
be
some
comfort

safety

fact

that
it
somehow
relieve
her
from

trouble

spiritual

so
the

kneel
down
together

pray
for
the
poor
wander
father

for
those
who
be
sorrow
for

at
home

and
when
he
come
to
the
petition
that
Adam
may
never
be
call
to
set
up
his
tent
in
a
far
country
,
but
that
his
mother
may
be
cheer
and
comfort
by
his
presence
all
the
day
of
her
pilgrimage

Lisbeth
's
ready
tear
flow
again

she
weep
aloud

when
they
rise
from

Seth
go
to

again

say
,

Meantime
Lisbeth
have
dry
her
eye
,
and
now
follow
Seth
,
hold
something
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
brown
-
and
-
yellow
platter
contain
the
bake
potato
with
the
gravy
in
them
and
bit
of
meat
which
she
have
cut

mixed
among

those
be
dear
time

when
wheaten
bread

fresh
meat

delicacy
to

She
set
the
dish
down
rather
timidly
on
the
bench
by
Adam

side

say
,
"

<EOS>
in
half
an
hour
all
be
quiet
;
no
sound
be
to
be
hear
in
the
house
but
the
loud
ticking
of
the
old
day
-
clock
and
the
ringing
of
Adam
's
tool
.
<EOS>
the
night
be
very
still
:
when
Adam
open
the
door
to
look
out
at
twelve
o'clock
,
the
only
motion
seem
to
be
in
the
glowing
,
twinkle
star
;
every
blade
of
grass
be
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
bodily
haste
and
exertion
usually
leave
our
thought
very
much
at
the
mercy
of
our
feeling
and
imagination
;
and
it
be
so
to
-
night
with
Adam
.
<EOS>
while
his
muscle
be
work
lustily
,
his
mind
seem
as
passive
as
a
spectator
at
a
diorama
:
scene
of
the
sad
past
,
and
probably
sad
future
,
float
before
him
and
give
place
one
to
the
other
in
swift
succession
.
  
<EOS>
He
see
how
it
would
be
to
-
morrow
morning
,
when
he
have
carry
the
coffin
to
Broxton
and
be
at
home
again
,
have
his
breakfast
:
his
father
perhaps
would
come
in
ashamed
to
meet
his
son
's
glance
 
would
sit
down
,
look
old
and
more
tottering
than
he
have
do
the
morning
before
,
and
hang
down
his
head
,
examine
the
floor
-
quarry
;
while
Lisbeth
would
ask
him
how
he
suppose
the
coffin
have
be
get
ready
,
that
he
have
slink
off
and
leave
undone
 
for
Lisbeth
be
always
the
first
to
utter
the
word
of
reproach
,
although
she
cry
at
Adam
's
severity
towards
his
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
it
will
go
on
,
worsen
and
worsen
,
"
think
Adam
;
"
there
be
no
slip
uphill
again
,
and
no
standing
still
when
once
you
'
ve
begin
to
slip
down
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
the
day
come
back
to
him
when
he
be
a
little
fellow
and
use
to
run
by
his
father
's
side
,
proud
to
be
take
out
to
work
,
and
prouder
still
to
hear
his
father
boast
to
his
fellow
-
workman
how
"
the
little
chap
have
an
uncommon
notion
o
'
carpentering
.
<EOS>
"
what
a
fine
active
fellow
his
father
be
then
!
<EOS>
when
people
ask
Adam
whose
little
lad
he
be
,
he
have
a
sense
of
distinction
as
he
answer
,
"
I
be
Thias
Bede
's
lad
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
quite
sure
everybody
know
<EOS>
Thias
Bede
 
<EOS>
do
not
he
make
the
wonderful
pigeon
-
house
at
Broxton
parsonage
?
<EOS>
those
be
happy
day
,
especially
when
Seth
,
who
be
three
year
the
young
,
begin
to
go
out
work
too
,
and
Adam
begin
to
be
a
teacher
as
well
as
a
learner
.
<EOS>
but
then
come
the
day
of
sadness
,
when
Adam
be
someway
on
in
his
teen
,
and
Thias
begin
to
loiter
at
the
public
-
house
,
and
Lisbeth
begin
to
cry
at
home
,
and
to
pour
forth
her
plaint
in
the
hearing
of
her
son
.
<EOS>
Adam
remember
well
the
night
of
shame
and
anguish
when
he
first
see
his
father
quite
wild
and
foolish
,
shout
a
song
out
fitfully
among
his
drunken
companion
at
the
"
Waggon
Overthrown
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
run
away
once
when
he
be
only
eighteen
,
make
his
escape
in
the
morning
twilight
with
a
little
blue
bundle
over
his
shoulder
,
and
his
"
mensuration
book
"
in
his
pocket
,
and
say
to
himself
very
decidedly
that
he
could
bear
the
vexation
of
home
no
longer
 
he
would
go
and
seek
his
fortune
,
set
up
his
stick
at
the
crossway
and
bend
his
step
the
way
it
fall
.
<EOS>
but
by
the
time
he
get
to
Stoniton
,
the
thought
of
his
mother
and
Seth
,
leave
behind
to
endure
everything
without
him
,
become
too
importunate
,
and
his
resolution
fail
him
.
<EOS>
He
come
back
the
next
day
,
but
the
misery
and
terror
his
mother
have
go
through
in
those
two
day
have
haunt
her
ever
since
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
!
"
<EOS>
Adam
say
to
himself
to
-
night
,
"
that
must
never
happen
again

<EOS>
It
'
ud
make
a
poor
balance

up

last

if
my
poor
old
mother

My

broad

strong

I
should

away

poke

"
  
<EOS>
at
this
moment
a
smart
rap
,
as
if
with
a
willow
wand
,
be
give
at
the
house
door
,
and
Gyp
,
instead
of
bark
,
as
may
have
be
expect
,
give
a
loud
howl
.
<EOS>
Adam
,
very
much
startled
,
go
at
once
to
the
door
and
open
it
.
<EOS>
nothing
be
there
;
all
be
still
,
as
when
he
open
it
an
hour
before
;
the
leave
be
motionless
,
and
the
light
of
the
star
show
the
placid
field
on
both
side
of
the
brook
quite
empty
of
visible
life
.
<EOS>
Adam
walk
round
the
house
,
and
still
see
nothing
except
a
rat
which
dart
into
the
woodshed
as
he
pass
.
<EOS>
He
go
in
again
,
wonder
;
the
sound
be
so
peculiar
that
the
moment
he
hear
it
it
call
up
the
image
of
the
willow
wand
strike
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
help
a
little
shudder
,
as
he
remember
how
often
his
mother
have
tell
him
of
just
such
a
sound
come
as
a
sign
when
some
one
be
die
.
<EOS>
Adam
be
not
a
man
to
be
gratuitously
superstitious
,
but
he
have
the
blood
of
the
peasant
in
him
as
well
as
of
the
artisan
,
and
a
peasant
can
no
more
help
believe
in
a
traditional
superstition
than
a
horse
can
help
tremble
when
he
see
a
camel
.
<EOS>
besides
,
he
have
that
mental
combination
which
be
at
once
humble
in
the
region
of
mystery
and
keen
in
the
region
of
knowledge
:
it
be
the
depth
of
his
reverence
quite
as
much
as
his
hard
common
sense
which
give
him
his
disinclination
to
doctrinal
religion
,
and
he
often
check
Seth
's
argumentative
spiritualism
by
say
,
"
eh
,
it
be
a
big
mystery
;
thee
know'st
but
little
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
it
happen
that
Adam
be
at
once
penetrating
and
credulous
.
<EOS>
if
a
new
building
have
fall
down
and
he
have
be
tell
that
this
be
a
divine
judgment
,
he
would
have
say
,
"
May
be
;
but
the
bearing
o
'
the
roof
and
wall
be
not
right
,
else
it
would
not
ha
'
come
down
"
;
yet
he
believe
in
dream
and
prognostic
,
and
to
his
die
day
he
bate
his
breath
a
little
when
he
tell
the
story
of
the
stroke
with
the
willow
wand
.
<EOS>
I
tell
it
as
he
tell
it
,
not
attempt
to
reduce
it
to
its
natural
element
 
in
our
eagerness
to
explain
impression
,
we
often
lose
our
hold
of
the
sympathy
that
comprehend
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
have
the
good
antidote
against
imaginative
dread
in
the
necessity
for
get
on
with
the
coffin
,
and
for
the
next
ten
minute
his
hammer
be
ring
so
uninterruptedly
,
that
other
sound
,
if
there
be
any
,
may
well
be
overpower
.
<EOS>
a
pause
come
,
however
,
when
he
have
to
take
up
his
ruler
,
and
now
again
come
the
strange
rap
,
and
again
Gyp
howl
.
<EOS>
Adam
be
at
the
door
without
the
loss
of
a
moment
;
but
again
all
be
still
,
and
the
starlight
show
there
be
nothing
but
the
dew
-
laden
grass
in
front
of
the
cottage
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
for
a
moment
think
uncomfortably
about
his
father
;
but
of
late
year
he
have
never
come
home
at
dark
hour
from
Treddleston
,
and
there
be
every
reason
for
believe
that
he
be
then
sleep
off
his
drunkenness
at
the
"
Waggon
Overthrown
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
besides
,
to
Adam
,
the
conception
of
the
future
be
so
inseparable
from
the
painful
image
of
his
father
that
the
fear
of
any
fatal
accident
to
him
be
exclude
by
the
deeply
infixed
fear
of
his
continual
degradation
.
<EOS>
the
next
thought
that
occur
to
him
be
one
that
make
him
slip
off
his
shoe
and
tread
lightly
upstairs
,
to
listen
at
the
bedroom
door
.
<EOS>
but
both
Seth
and
his
mother
be
breathe
regularly
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
come
down
and
set
to
work
again
,
say
to
himself
,
"
I
will
not
open
the
door
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
use
stare
about
to
catch
sight
of
a
sound
.
<EOS>
maybe
there
be
a
world
about
us
as
we
can
not
see
,
but
th
'
ear
's
quick
than
the
eye
and
catch
a
sound
from't
now
and
then
.
<EOS>
some
people
think
they
get
a
sight
on't
too
,
but
they
be
mostly
folk
whose
eye
be
not
much
use
to
'em
at
anything
else
.
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
think
it
be
well
to
see
when
your
perpendicular
's
true
than
to
see
a
ghost
.
"
  
<EOS>
such
thought
as
these
be
apt
to
grow
strong
and
strong
as
daylight
quench
the
candle
and
the
bird
begin
to
sing
.
<EOS>
by
the
time
the
red
sunlight
shine
on
the
brass
nail
that
form
the
initial
on
the
lid
of
the
coffin
,
any
linger
forebode
from
the
sound
of
the
willow
wand
be
merge
in
satisfaction
that
the
work
be
do
and
the
promise
redeem
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
need
to
call
Seth
,
for
he
be
already
move
overhead
,
and
presently
come
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
lad
,
"
say
Adam
,
as
Seth
make
his
appearance
,
"
the
coffin
be
do
,
and
we
can
take
it
over
to
Brox'on
,
and
be
back
again
before
half
after
six
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
a
mouthful
o

oat

cake

and
then
we
will
be
off

"
  
<EOS>
the
coffin
be
soon
prop
on
the
tall
shoulder
of
the
two
brother
,
and
they
be
make
their
way
,
follow
close
by
Gyp
,
out
of
the
little
woodyard
into
the
lane
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
be
but
about
a
mile
and
a
half
to
Broxton
over
the
opposite
slope
,
and
their
road
wound
very
pleasantly
along
lane
and
across
field
,
where
the
pale
woodbine
and
the
dog
-
rose
be
scent
the
hedgerow
,
and
the
bird
be
twitter
and
trill
in
the
tall
leafy
bough
of
oak
and
elm
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
strangely
mingle
picture
 
the
fresh
youth
of
the
summer
morning
,
with
its
Edenlike
peace
and
loveliness
,
the
stalwart
strength
of
the
two
brother
in
their
rusty
work
clothe
,
and
the
long
coffin
on
their
shoulder
.
<EOS>
They
pause
for
the
last
time
before
a
small
farmhouse
outside
the
village
of
Broxton
.
<EOS>
by
six
o'clock
the
task
be
do
,
the
coffin
nail
down
,
and
Adam
and
Seth
be
on
their
way
home
.
<EOS>
They
choose
a
short
way
homeward
,
which
would
take
them
across
the
field
and
the
brook
in
front
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Adam
have
not
mention
to
Seth
what
have
happen
in
the
night
,
but
he
still
retain
sufficient
impression
from
it
himself
to
say
,
"
Seth
,
lad
,
if
Father
be
not
come
home
by
the
time

have
our
breakfast

it
will
be

well
for
thee
to
go
over
to
Treddles'on

look
after

thee
canst
get

the
brass
wire
I

I

Seth

<EOS>
but
see
what
cloud
have
gather
since
we
set
out
.
<EOS>
I
be
think
we
shall
have
more
rain

It
will
be
a
sore
time
for

fine

full

we
should
have
to
go
round
by
the
road

<EOS>
They
be
come
across
the
valley
now
,
and
have
enter
the
pasture
through
which
the
brook
run
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
what
be
that
stick
against
the
willow
?
"
<EOS>
continue
Seth
,
begin
to
walk
faster
.
<EOS>
Adam
's
heart
rise
to
his
mouth
:
the
vague
anxiety
about
his
father
be
change
into
a
great
dread
.
<EOS>
He
make
no
answer
to
Seth
,
but
run
forward
precede
by
Gyp
,
who
begin
to
bark
uneasily
;
and
in
two
moment
he
be
at
the
bridge
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
what
the
oman
mean
,
then
!
<EOS>
and
the
grey
-
haired
father
,
of
whom
he
have
think
with
a
sort
of
hardness
a
few
hour
ago
,
as
certain
to
live
to
be
a
thorn
in
his
side
be
perhaps
even
then
struggle
with
that
watery
death
!
<EOS>
this
be
the
first
thought
that
flash
through
Adam
's
conscience
,
before
he
have
time
to
seize
the
coat
and
drag
out
the
tall
heavy
body
.
<EOS>
Seth
be
already
by
his
side
,
help
him
,
and
when
they
have
it
on
the
bank
,
the
two
son
in
the
first
moment
knelt
and
look
with
mute
awe
at
the
glaze
eye
,
forget
that
there
be
need
for
action
 
forget
everything
but
that
their
father
lie
dead
before
them

<EOS>
Adam
be
the
first
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
run
to
Mother

in
a
loud
whisper

Poor

turn
quickly

in
reality
Adam
be
convince
that
his

be
dead

he
know
there
be
no

way

repress
his

impetuous

it

<EOS>
He
run
back
to
Seth

and
the
two

lift
the
sad
burden
in
heart

stricken
silence

<EOS>
the
wide

open
glaze
eye
be
grey

like
Seth

have
once
look
with
mild
pride
on
the
boy
before
whom
Thias
have
live
to
hang
his

in
shame

<EOS>
Seth
's
chief
feeling
be
awe
and
distress
at
this
sudden
snatching
away
of
his
father
's
soul
;
but
Adam
's
mind
rush
back
over
the
past
in
a
flood
of
relenting
and
pity
.
<EOS>
when
death
,
the
great
Reconciler

have
come
,
it
be
never
our
tenderness
that
we
repent
of
,
but
our
severity

<EOS>
the
Rector
  
<EOS>
before
twelve
o'clock
there
have
be
some
heavy
storm
of
rain
,
and
the
water
lie
in
deep
gutter
on
the
side
of
the
gravel
walk
in
the
garden
of
Broxton
Parsonage
;
the
great
Provence
rose

be
cruelly
toss

all
the
delicate

be
dash
down

stain
with
the
wet
soil

<EOS>
a
melancholy
morning
 
because
it

nearly
time
hay

harvest
should
begin

and
instead
of
that
the
meadow
be
likely
to

indoor
enjoyment

if

Mr.

chess

he

both
his

quite
well
enough
to
pass
some
cloudy
hour
very
easily

We

,
who
be
doze
,
with
his
black
muzzle
aloft
,
like
a
sleepy
president
.
  
<EOS>
the
room
be
a
large
and
lofty
one
,
with
an
ample
mullione
oriel
window
at
one
end
;
the
wall
,
you
see
,
be
new
,
and
not
yet
paint
;
but
the
furniture
,
though
originally
of
an
expensive
sort
,
be
old
and
scanty
,
and
there
be
no
drapery
about
the
window
.
<EOS>
the
crimson
cloth
over
the
large
dining
-
table
be
very
threadbare
,
though
it
contrast
pleasantly
enough
with
the
dead
hue
of
the
plaster
on
the
wall
;
but
on
this
cloth
there
be
a
massive
silver
waiter
with
a
decanter
of
water
on
it
,
of
the
same
pattern
as
two
large
one
that
be
prop
up
on
the
sideboard
with
a
coat
of
arm
conspicuous
in
their
centre
.
<EOS>
You
suspect
at
once
that
the
inhabitant
of
this
room
have
inherit
more
blood
than
wealth
,
and
would
not
be
surprised
to
find
that
Mr.
Irwine
have
a
finely
cut
nostril
and
upper
lip
;
but
at
present
we
can
only
see
that
he
have
a
broad
flat
back
and
an
abundance
of
powdered
hair
,
all
throw
backward
and
tie
behind
with
a
black
ribbon
 
a
bit
of
conservatism
in
costume
which
tell
you
that
he
be
not
a
young
man
.
<EOS>
He
will
perhaps
turn
round
by
and
by
,
and
in
the
meantime
we
can
look
at
that
stately
old
lady
,
his
mother
,
a
beautiful
aged
brunette
,
whose
rich
-
tone
complexion
be
well
set
off
by
the
complex
wrapping
of
pure
white
cambric
and
lace
about
her
head
and
neck
.
<EOS>
She
be
as
erect
in
her
comely
embonpoint
as
a
statue
of
cere
;
and
her
dark
face
,
with
its
delicate
aquiline
nose
,
firm
proud
mouth
,
and
small
,
intense
,
black
eye
,
be
so
keen
and
sarcastic
in
its
expression
that
you
instinctively
substitute
a
pack
of
card
for
the
chess
-
man
and
imagine
her
tell
your
fortune
.
<EOS>
the
small
brown
hand
with
which
she
be
lift
her
queen
be
laden
with
pearl
,
diamond
,
and
turquoise
;
and
a
large
black
veil
be
very
carefully
adjust
over
the
crown
of
her
cap
,
and
fall
in
sharp
contrast
on
the
white
fold
about
her
neck
.
<EOS>
It
must
take
a
long
time
to
dress
that
old
lady
in
the
morning
!
<EOS>
but
it
seem
a
law
of
nature
that
she
should
be
dress
so
:
she
be
clearly
one
of
those
child
of
royalty
who
have
never
doubt
their
right
divine
and
never
meet
with
any
one
so
absurd
as
to
question
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
,
Dauphin
,
tell
me
what
that
be
!
"
<EOS>
say
this
magnificent
old
lady
,
as
she
deposit
her
queen
very
quietly
and
fold
her
arm
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
sorry
to
utter
a
word
disagreeable
to
your
feeling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
you
witch
-
mother
,
you
sorceress
!
<EOS>
how
be
a
christian
man
to
win
a
game
off
you
?
<EOS>
I
should
have
sprinkle
the
board
with
holy
water
before
we
begin
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
win
that
game
by
fair
mean
,
now
,
so
do
not
pretend
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
that
be
what
the
beat
have
always
say
of
great
conqueror
.
<EOS>
but
see
,
there
be
the
sunshine
fall
on
the
board
,
to
show
you
more
clearly
what
a
foolish
move
you
make
with
that
pawn
.
<EOS>
come
,
shall
I
give
you
another
chance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Mother
,
I
shall
leave
you
to
your
own
conscience
,
now
it
be
clear
up
.
<EOS>
We
must
go
and
plash
up
the
mud
a
little
,
mus'n't
we
,
Juno
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
be
address
to
the
brown
setter
,
who
have
jump
up
at
the
sound
of
the
voice
and
lay
her
nose
in
an
insinuating
way
on
her
master
's
leg
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
must
go
upstairs
first
and
see
Anne
.
<EOS>
I
be
call
away
to
Tholer
's
funeral
just
when
I
be
go
before

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
of
no
use

child
;
she
can
not
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
Kate
say
she
have
one
of
her
bad
headache
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
she
like
me
to
go
and
see
her
just
the
same
;
she
be
never
too
ill
to
care
about
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
if
you
know
how
much
of
human
speech
be
mere
purposeless
impulse
or
habit
,
you
will
not
wonder
when
I
tell
you
that
this
identical
objection
have
be
make
,
and
have
receive
the
same
kind
of
answer
,
many
hundred
time
in
the
course
of
the
fifteen
year
that
Mr.
Irwine
's
sister
Anne
have
be
an
invalid
.
<EOS>
splendid
old
lady
,
who
take
a
long
time
to
dress
in
the
morning
,
have
often
slight
sympathy
with
sickly
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
but
while
Mr.
Irwine
be
still
seat
,
lean
back
in
his
chair
and
stroke
Juno
's
head
,
the
servant
come
to
the
door
and
say
,
"

<EOS>
"
let
him
be
show
in
here
,
"
say
Mrs.
Irwine
,
take
up
her
knitting
.
<EOS>
"
I
always
like
to
hear
what
Mr.
Rann
have
get
to
say
.
<EOS>
His
shoe
will
be
dirty
,
but
see
that
he
wipe
them
Carroll

"
  
<EOS>
in
two
minute
Mr.
Rann
appear
at
the
door
with
very
deferential
bow
,
which
,
however
,
be
far
from
conciliate
Pug
,
who
give
a
sharp
bark
and
run
across
the
room
to
reconnoitre
the
stranger
's
leg
;
while
the
two
puppy
,
regard
Mr.
Rann
's
prominent
calf
and
rib
worst
stocking
from
a
more
sensuous
point
of
view
,
plunge
and
growl
over
them
in
great
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
meantime
,
Mr.
Irwine
turn
round
his
chair
and
say
,
"
well
,
Joshua
,
anything
the
matter
at
Hayslope

that
you
have
come
over
this
damp
morning
?

sit
down

sit
down

never

the
dog
;
give
them
a
friendly
kick

<EOS>
here

Pug
,
you
rascal
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
pleasant
to
see
some
man
turn
round
;
pleasant
as
a
sudden
rush
of
warm
air
in
winter
,
or
the
flash
of
firelight
in
the
chill
dusk
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
be
one
of
those
man
.
<EOS>
He
bear
the
same
sort
of
resemblance
to
his
mother
that
our
love
memory
of
a
friend
's
face
often
bear
to
the
face
itself
:
the
line
be
all
more
generous
,
the
smile
brighter
,
the
expression
heartier
.
<EOS>
if
the
outline
have
be
less
finely
cut
,
his
face
may
have
be
call
jolly
;
but
that
be
not
the
right
word
for
its
mixture
of
bonhomie
and
distinction
.
  
<EOS>
"

Your

answer
Mr.
Rann
,
endeavour
to
look
unconcerned
about
his
leg
,

shake
them
alternately
to
keep
off
the
puppy
;

quite
ashamed

have
speak
so
abruptly

She
look

I
do
not
know
how
I
can
manage
that

mother

it
will
hardly
do

me

patronize
a
Methodist
preacher

even
if
she
would
consent

be
patronize
by

idle
shepherd

as
Will

call

You
should

come

to
hear
Joshua

denunciation
of
his
neighbour
Will
Maskery

the
old
fellow
want
me
to
excommunicate
the
wheelwright

then
deliver
him
over
to
the
civil
arm

be
to
say

to
your
grandfather

be
turn
out
of
house
and
yard

<EOS>
if
I
choose
to
interfere
in
this
business
,
now
,
I
may
get
up
as
pretty
a
story
of
hatred
and
persecution
as
the
Methodists
need
desire
to
publish
in
the
next
number
of
their
magazine
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
take
me
much
trouble
to
persuade
Chad
Cranage
and
half
a
dozen
other
bull

head
fellow
that
they
would
be
do
an
acceptable
service
to
the
Church
by
hunt
Will
Maskery
out
of
the
village
with
rope

end
and
pitchfork
;
and
then
,
when
I
have
furnish
them
with
half
a
sovereign
to
get
gloriously
drunk
after
their
exertion
,
I
should
have
put
the
climax
to
as
pretty
a
farce
as
any
of
my
brother
clergy

the

up

part

pause

knock
gently

enter

darken

curtain

Miss
Kate

the
thin
middle

aged
lady
stand
by

bedside

would
not
have
have
light
enough
for
any
other
sort
of
work
than
the
knitting
which
lie
on

little
table
near
her

at

she
be
do
what
require
only
the
dim
light
 
sponge
the
ache
head
that
lie
on
the
pillow
with
fresh
vinegar

It
be
a
small
face
,
that
of
the
poor
sufferer
;
perhaps
it
have
once
be
pretty
,
but
now
it
be
wear
and
sallow
.
<EOS>
Miss
Kate
come
towards
her
brother

whisper
,
"
do
not

Mr.

go
to

take
up
one
of

delicate
hand

kiss
it

a
slight
pressure
from
the
small
finger
tell
him
that
it
be
worth

to
have
come
upstairs
for

do
that

<EOS>
He
linger
a
moment
,
look
at

then
turn
away
and
leave
the
room

tread
very
gently
 
he
have
take
off
his

put
on
slipper
before

upstairs

whoever
remember
how

he
have
decline

do
even
for
himself
,
rather
than
have
the
trouble
of
put
on

take
off

will
not

detail
insignificant

<EOS>
and
Mr.

sister
,
as
any
person
of
family
within
ten
mile
of
Broxton
could
have
testify
,
be
such
stupid
,
unintereste
woman
!
<EOS>
It
be
quite
a
pity
handsome
,
clever
Mrs.
Irwine
should
have
have
such
commonplace
daughter
.
<EOS>
that
fine
old
lady
herself
be
worth
drive
ten
mile
to
see
,
any
day
;
her
beauty
,
her
well
-
preserve
faculty
,
and
her
old
-
fashioned
dignity
make
her
a
graceful
subject
for
conversation
in
turn
with
the
King
's
health
,
the
sweet
new
pattern
in
cotton
dress
,
the
news
from
Egypt
,
and
Lord
Dacey
's
lawsuit
,
which
be
fret
poor
Lady
Dacey
to
death
.
<EOS>
but
no
one
ever
think
of
mention
the
Miss
Irwines
,
except
the
poor
people
in
Broxton
village
,
who
regard
them
as
deep
in
the
science
of
medicine
,
and
speak
of
them
vaguely
as
"
the
gentlefolk
.
<EOS>
"
if
any
one
have
ask
old
Job
Dummilow
who
give
him
his
flannel
jacket
,
he
would
have
answer
,
"
the
gentlefolk
,
last
winter
"
;
and
widow
Steene
dwell
much
on
the
virtue
of
the
"
stuff
"
the
gentlefolk
give
her
for
her
cough
.
<EOS>
under
this
name
too
,
they
be
use
with
great
effect
as
a
means
of
tame
refractory
child
,
so
that
at
the
sight
of
poor
Miss
Anne
's
sallow
face
,
several
small
urchin
have
a
terrified
sense
that
she
be
cognizant
of
all
their
bad
misdemeanour
,
and
know
the
precise
number
of
stone
with
which
they
have
intend
to
hit
Farmer
Britton
's
duck
.
<EOS>
but
for
all
who
see
them
through
a
less
mythical
medium
,
the
Miss
Irwines
be
quite
superfluous
existence
 
inartistic
figure
crowd
the
canvas
of
life
without
adequate
effect
.
<EOS>
Miss
Anne
,
indeed
,
if
her
chronic
headache
could
have
be
account
for
by
a
pathetic
story
of
disappointed
love
,
may
have
have
some
romantic
interest
attach
to
her
:
but
no
such
story
have
either
be
know
or
invent
concern
her
,
and
the
general
impression
be
quite
in
accordance
with
the
fact
,
that
both
the
sister
be
old
maid
for
the
prosaic
reason
that
they
have
never
receive
an
eligible
offer
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
to
speak
paradoxically
,
the
existence
of
insignificant
people
have
very
important
consequence
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
can
be
show
to
affect
the
price
of
bread
and
the
rate
of
wage
,
to
call
forth
many
evil
temper
from
the
selfish
and
many
heroism
from
the
sympathetic
,
and
,
in
other
way
,
to
play
no
small
part
in
the
tragedy
of
life
.
<EOS>
and
if
that
handsome
,
generous
-
blooded
clergyman
,
the
Rev.
Adolphus
Irwine
,
have
not
have
these
two
hopelessly
maiden
sister
,
his
lot
would
have
be
shape
quite
differently
:
he
would
very
likely
have
take
a
comely
wife
in
his
youth
,
and
now
,
when
his
hair
be
get
grey
under
the
powder
,
would
have
have
tall
son
and
bloom
daughter
 
such
possession
,
in
short
,
as
man
commonly
think
will
repay
them
for
all
the
labour
they
take
under
the
sun
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
 
have
with
all
his
three
living
no
more
than
seven
hundred
a
-
year
,
and
see
no
way
of
keep
his
splendid
mother
and
his
sickly
sister
,
not
to
reckon
a
second
sister
,
who
be
usually
speak
of
without
any
adjective
,
in
such
ladylike
ease
as
become
their
birth
and
habit
,
and
at
the
same
time
provide
for
a
family
of
his
own
 
<EOS>
he
remain
,
you
see
,
at
the
age
of
eight
-
and
-
forty
,
a
bachelor
,
not
make
any
merit
of
that
renunciation
,
but
say
laughingly
,
if
any
one
allude
to
it
,
that
he
make
it
an
excuse
for
many
indulgence
which
a
wife
would
never
have
allow
him
.
<EOS>
and
perhaps
he
be
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
do
not
think
his
sister
unintereste
and
superfluous
;
for
his
be
one
of
those
large
-
hearted
,
sweet
-
blooded
nature
that
never
know
a
narrow
or
a
grudging
thought
;
Epicurean
,
if
you
will
,
with
no
enthusiasm
,
no
self
-
scourge
sense
of
duty
;
but
yet
,
as
you
have
see
,
of
a
sufficiently
subtle
moral
fibre
to
have
an
unwearying
tenderness
for
obscure
and
monotonous
suffering
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
large
-
hearted
indulgence
that
make
him
ignore
his
mother
's
hardness
towards
her
daughter
,
which
be
the
more
striking
from
its
contrast
with
her
dote
fondness
towards
himself
;
he
hold
it
no
virtue
to
frown
at
irremediable
fault
.
  
<EOS>
see
the
difference
between
the
impression
a
man
make
on
you
when
you
walk
by
his
side
in
familiar
talk
,
or
look
at
him
in
his
home
,
and
the
figure
he
make
when
see
from
a
lofty
historical
level
,
or
even
in
the
eye
of
a
critical
neighbour
who
think
of
him
as
an
embodied
system
or
opinion
rather
than
as
a
man
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Roe

have
include
Mr.

statement

he
describe
as

up
to

lust
of
the
flesh
and
the
pride
of
life
;
hunting
and
shooting

and
adorn
their

;
ask
what
shall
we
eat
,

what
shall
we
drink

wherewithal
shall
we
be
clothe
?

of
dispense
the
bread
of

the

too

it
be
impossible

altogether
belie
by

really

no

lofty

no

if
I
be
closely
question
,
I
should
be
oblige
to
confess
that
he
feel
no
serious
alarm
about
the
soul
of
his
parishioner

would
have
think
it

or
even
to
Chad
Cranage
the
blacksmith
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
be
in
the
habit
of
speak
theoretically
,
he
would
perhaps
have
say
that
the
only
healthy
form
religion
could
take
in
such
mind
<EOS>
be
that
of
certain
dim
but
strong
emotion
,
suffuse
themselves
as
a
hallowing
influence
over
the
family
affection
and
neighbourly
duty
.
<EOS>
He
think
the
custom
of
baptism
more
important
than
its
doctrine
,
and
that
the
religious
benefit
the
peasant
draw
from
the
church
where
his
father
worship
and
the
sacred
piece
of
turf
where
they
lie
bury
be
but
slightly
dependent
on
a
clear
understanding
of
the
Liturgy
or
the
sermon
.
<EOS>
clearly
the
rector
be
not
what
be
call
in
these
day
an
"
earnest
"
man
:
he
be
fonder
of
church
history
than
of
divinity
,
and
have
much
more
insight
into
man
's
character
than
interest
in
their
opinion
;
he
be
neither
laborious
,
nor
obviously
self
-
deny
,
nor
very
copious
in
alms
-
give
,
and
his
theology
,
you
perceive
,
be
lax
.
<EOS>
His
mental
palate
,
indeed
,
be
rather
pagan
,
and
find
a
savouriness
in
a
quotation
from
Sophocles
or
Theocritus
that
be
quite
absent
from
any
text
in
Isaiah
or
Amos
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
feed
your
young
setter
on
raw
flesh
,
how
can
you
wonder
at
its
retain
a
relish
for
uncooked
partridge
in
after
-
life
?
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Irwine
's
recollection
of
young
enthusiasm
and
ambition
be
all
associate
with
poetry
and
ethic
that
lie
aloof
from
the
Bible
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
I
must
plead
,
for
I
have
an
affectionate
partiality
towards
the
rector
's
memory
,
that
he
be
not
vindictive
 
and
some
philanthropist
have
be
so
;
that
he
be
not
intolerant
 
and
there
be
a
rumour
that
some
zealous
theologian
have
not
be
altogether
free
from
that
blemish
;
that
although
he
would
probably
have
decline
to
give
his
body
to
be
burn
in
any
public
cause
,
and
be
far
from
bestow
all
his
good
to
feed
the
poor
,
he
have
that
charity
which
have
sometimes
be
lack
to
very
illustrious
virtue
 
<EOS>
he
be
tender
to
other
man
's
failing
,
and
unwilling
to
impute
evil
.
<EOS>
He
be
one
of
those
man
,
and
they
be
not
the
common
,
of
whom
we
can
know
the
good
only
by
follow
them
away
from
the
marketplace
,
the
platform
,
and
the
pulpit
,
enter
with
them
into
their
own
home
,
hear
the
voice
with
which
they
speak
to
the
young
and
aged
about
their
own
hearthstone
,
and
witness
their
thoughtful
care
for
the
everyday
want
of
everyday
companion
,
who
take
all
their
kindness
as
a
matter
of
course
,
and
not
as
a
subject
for
panegyric
.
  
<EOS>
such
man
,
happily
,
have
live
in
time
when
great
abuse
flourish
,
and
have
sometimes
even
be
the
live
representative
of
the
abuse
.
<EOS>
that
be
a
thought
which
may
comfort
us
a
little
under
the
opposite
fact
 
that
it
be
well
sometimes
not
to
follow
great
reformer
of
abuse
beyond
the
threshold
of
their
home
.
  
<EOS>
but
whatever
you
may
think
of
Mr.
Irwine
now
,
if
you
have
meet
him
that
June
afternoon
ride
on
his
grey
cob
,
with
his
dog
run
beside
him
 
portly
,
upright
,
manly
,
with
a
good
-
natured
smile
on
his
finely
turn
lip
as
he
talk
to
his
dash
young
companion
on
the
bay
mare
,
you
must
have
feel
that
,
however
ill
he
harmonize
with
sound
theory
of
the
clerical
office
,
he
somehow
harmonize
extremely
well
with
that
peaceful
landscape
.
  
<EOS>
see
them
in
the
bright
sunlight
,
interrupt
every
now
and
then
by
roll
masse
of
cloud
,
ascend
the
slope
from
the
Broxton
side
,
where
the
tall
gable
and
elm
of
the
rectory
predominate
over
the
tiny
whitewashed
church
.
<EOS>
They
will
soon
be
in
the
parish
of
Hayslope
;
the
grey
church
-
tower
and
village
roof
lie
before
them
to
the
left
,
and
farther
on
,
to
the
right
<EOS>
,
they
can
just
see
the
chimney
of
the
Hall
Farm
.
    
<EOS>
the
Hall
Farm
  
EVIDENTLY
that
gate
be
never
open
,
for
the
long
grass
and
<EOS>
the
great
hemlock
grow
close
against
it
,
and
if
it
be
open
,
it
be
so
rusty
that
the
force
necessary
to
turn
it
on
its
hinge
would
be
likely
to
pull
down
the
square
stone
-
build
pillar
,
to
the
detriment
of
the
two
stone
lioness
which
grin
with
a
doubtful
carnivorous
affability
above
a
coat
of
arm
surmount
each
of
the
pillar
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
easy
enough
,
by
the
aid
of
the
nick
in
the
stone
pillar
,
to
climb
over
the
brick
wall
with
its
smooth
stone
cope
;
but
by
put
our
eye
close
to
the
rusty
bar
of
the
gate
,
we
can
see
the
house
well
enough
,
and
all
but
the
very
corner
of
the
grassy
enclosure
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
fine
old
place
,
of
red
brick
,
soften
by
a
pale
powdery
lichen
,
which
have
disperse
itself
with
happy
irregularity
,
so
as
to
bring
the
red
brick
into
term
of
friendly
companionship
with
the
limestone
ornament
surround
the
three
gable
,
the
window
,
and
the
door
-
place
.
<EOS>
but
the
window
be
patch
with
wooden
pane
,
and
the
door
,
I
think
,
be
like
the
gate
 
it
be
never
open
.
<EOS>
how
it
would
groan
and
grate
against
the
stone
floor
if
it
be
!
<EOS>
for
it
be
a
solid
,
heavy
,
handsome
door
,
and
must
once
have
be
in
the
habit
of
shut
with
a
sonorous
bang
behind
a
liverie
lackey
,
who
have
just
see
his
master
and
mistress
off
the
ground
in
a
carriage
and
pair
.
  
<EOS>
but
at
present
one
may
fancy
the
house
in
the
early
stage
of
a
chancery
suit
,
and
that
the
fruit
from
that
grand
double
row
of
walnut
-
tree
on
the
right
hand
of
the
enclosure
would
fall
and
rot
among
the
grass
,
if
it
be
not
that
we
hear
the
booming
bark
of
dog
echo
from
great
building
at
the
back
.
<EOS>
and
now
the
half
-
wean
calf
that
have
be
shelter
themselves
in
a
gorse
-
build
hovel
against
the
left
-
hand
wall
come
out
and
set
up
a
silly
answer
to
that
terrible
bark
,
doubtless
supposing
that
it
have
reference
to
bucket
of
milk
.
  
<EOS>
yes
,
the
house
must
be
inhabit
,
and
we
will
see
by
whom
;
for
imagination
be
a
licensed
trespasser
:
it
have
no
fear
of
dog
,
but
may
climb
over
wall
and
peep
in
at
window
with
impunity
.
<EOS>
put
your
face
to
one
of
the
glass
pan
in
the
right
-
hand
window
:
what
do
you
see
?
<EOS>
a
large
open
fireplace
,
with
rusty
dog
in
it
,
and
a
bare
board
floor
;
at
the
far
end
,
fleece
of
wool
stack
up
;
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
,
some
empty
corn
-
bag
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
furniture
of
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
and
what
through
the
left
-
hand
window
?
<EOS>
several
clothe
-
horse
,
a
pillion
,
a
spinning
-
wheel
,
and
an
old
box
wide
open
and
stuff
full
of
coloured
rag
.
<EOS>
at
the
edge
of
this
box
there
lie
a
great
wooden
doll
,
which
,
so
far
as
mutilation
be
concern
,
bear
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
fine
greek
sculpture
,
and
especially
in
the
total
loss
of
its
nose
.
<EOS>
near
it
there
be
a
little
chair
,
and
the
butt
end
of
a
boy
's
leather
long
-
lash
whip
.
  
<EOS>
the
history
of
the
house
be
plain
now
.
<EOS>
It
be
once
the
residence
of
a
country
squire
,
whose
family
,
probably
dwindle
down
to
mere
spinsterhood
,
get
merge
in
the
more
territorial
name
of
Donnithorne
.
<EOS>
It
be
once
the
Hall
;
it
be
now
the
Hall
Farm
.
<EOS>
like
the
life
in
some
coast
town
that
be
once
a
watering
-
place
,
and
be
now
a
port
,
where
the
genteel
street
be
silent
and
grass
-
grow
,
and
the
dock
and
warehouse
busy
and
resonant
,
the
life
at
the
Hall
have
change
its
focus
,
and
no
longer
radiate
from
the
parlour
,
but
from
the
kitchen
and
the
farmyard
.
  
<EOS>
plenty
of
life
there
,
though
this
be
the
drowsy
time
of
the
year
,
just
before
hay
-
harvest
;
and
it
be
the
drowsy
time
of
the
day
too
,
for
it
be
close
upon
three
by
the
sun
,
and
it
be
<EOS>
half
-
past
three
by
Mrs.
Poyser
's
handsome
eight
-
day
clock
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
always
a
strong
sense
of
life
when
the
sun
be
brilliant
after
rain
;
and
now
he
be
pour
down
his
beam
,
and
make
sparkle
among
the
wet
straw
,
and
light
up
every
patch
of
vivid
green
mos
on
the
red
tile
of
the
cow
-
shed
,
and
turn
even
the
muddy
water
that
be
hurry
along
the
channel
to
the
drain
into
a
mirror
for
the
yellow
-
bill
duck
,
who
be
seize
the
opportunity
of
get
a
drink
with
as
much
body
in
it
as
possible
.
<EOS>
there
be
quite
a
concert
of
noise
;
the
great
bull
-
dog
,
chain
against
the
stable
,
be
throw
into
furious
exasperation
by
the
unwary
approach
of
a
cock
too
near
the
mouth
of
his
kennel
,
and
send
forth
a
thundering
bark
,
which
be
answer
by
two
fox
-
hound
shut
up
in
the
opposite
cow
-
house
;
the
old
top
-
knot
hen
,
scratch
with
their
chick
among
the
straw
,
set
up
a
sympathetic
croaking
as
the
discomfited
cock
join
them
;
a
sow
with
her
brood
,
all
very
muddy
as
to
the
leg
,
and
curl
as
to
the
tail
,
throw
in
some
deep
staccato
note
;
our
friend
the
calf
be
bleat
from
the
home
croft
;
and
,
under
all
,
a
fine
ear
discern
the
continuous
hum
of
human
voice
.
  
<EOS>
for
the
great
barn
-
door
be
throw
wide
open
,
and
man
be
busy
there
mend
the
harness
,
under
the
superintendence
of
Mr.
Goby
,
the
"
whittaw
,
"
otherwise
saddler
,
who
entertain
them
with
the
late
Treddleston
gossip
.
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
rather
an
unfortunate
day
that
Alick
,
the
shepherd
,
have
choose
for
have
the
whittaw
,
since
the
morning
turn
out
so
wet
;
and
Mrs.
Poyser
have
speak
her
mind
pretty
strongly
as
to
the
dirt
which
the
extra
number
of
man
's
shoe
bring
into
the
house
at
dinnertime
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
have
not
yet
recover
her
equanimity
on
the
subject
,
though
it
be
now
nearly
three
hour
since
dinner
,
and
the
house
-
floor
be
perfectly
clean
again
;
as
clean
as
everything
else
in
that
wonderful
house
-
place
,
where
the
only
chance
of
collect
a
few
grain
of
dust
would
be
to
climb
on
the
salt
-
coffer
,
and
put
your
finger
on
the
high
mantel
-
shelf
on
which
the
glitter
brass
candlestick
be
enjoy
their
summer
sinecure
;
for
at
this
time
of
year
,
of
course
,
every
one
go
to
bed
while
it
be
yet
light
,
or
at
least
light
enough
to
discern
the
outline
of
object
after
you
have
bruise
your
shin
against
them
.
<EOS>
surely
nowhere
else
could
an
oak
clock
-
case
and
an
oak
table
have
get
to
such
a
polish
by
the
hand
:
genuine
"
elbow
polish
,
"
as
Mrs.
Poyser
call
it
,
for
she
thank
God
<EOS>
she
never
have
any

your
varnished
rubbish
in
her
house

<EOS>
Hetty
Sorrel
often
take
the
opportunity
,
when
her
aunt

back
be
turn

of
look
at
the
pleasing
reflection
of
herself
in
those
polished
surface
,
for
the
oak
table
be
usually
turn
up
like
a
screen
,
and
be
more
for
ornament
than
for
use
;
and
she
could
see
herself
sometimes
in
the
great
round
pewter
dish
that
be
range
on
the
shelf
above
the
long
deal
dinner
-
table
,
or
in
the
hobs
of
the
grate
,
which
always
shine
like
jasper

<EOS>
everything
be
look
at
its
bright
at
this
moment
,
for
the
sun
shine
right
on
the
pewter
dish
,
and
from
their
reflect
surface
pleasant
jet
of
light
be
throw
on
mellow
oak
and
bright
brass
 
and
on
a
still
pleasanter
object
than
these
,
for
some
of
the
ray
fall
on
Dinah
's
finely
mould
cheek
,
and
light
up
her
pale
red
hair
to
auburn
,
as
she
bend
over
the
heavy
household
linen
which
she
be
mend
for
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
no
scene
could
have
be
more
peaceful
,
if
Mrs.
Poyser
,
who
be
iron
a
few
thing
that
still
remain
from
the
Monday
's
wash
,
have
not
be
make
a
frequent
clinking
with
her
iron
and
move
to
and
fro
whenever
she
want
it
to
cool
;
carry
the
keen
glance
of
her
blue
-
grey
eye
from
the
kitchen
to
the
dairy
,
where
Hetty
be
make
up
the
butter
,
and
from
the
dairy
to
the
back
kitchen
,
where
Nancy
be
take
the
pie
out
of
the
oven
.
<EOS>
do
not
suppose
,
however
,
that
Mrs.
Poyser
be
elderly
or
shrewish
in
her
appearance
;
she
be
a
good
-
look
woman
,
not
more
than
eight
-
and
-
thirty
,
of
fair
complexion
and
sandy
hair
,
well
-
shapen
,
light
-
footed
.
<EOS>
the
most
conspicuous
article
in
her
attire
be
an
ample
checker
linen
apron
,
which
almost
cover
her
skirt
;
and
nothing
could
be
plainer
or
less
noticeable
than
her
cap
and
gown
,
for
there
be
no
weakness
of
which
she
be
less
tolerant
than
feminine
vanity
,
and
the
preference
of
ornament
to
utility
.
<EOS>
the
family
likeness
between
her
and
her
niece
Dinah
Morris
,
with
the
contrast
between
her
keenness
and
Dinah
's
seraphic
gentleness
of
expression
,
may
have
serve
a
painter
as
an
excellent
suggestion
for
a
Martha
and
Mary
.
<EOS>
Their
eye
be
just
of
the
same
colour
,
but
a
striking
test
of
the
difference
in
their
operation
be
see
in
the
demeanour
of
Trip
,
the
black
-
and
-
tan
terrier
,
whenever
that
much
-
suspect
dog
unwarily
expose
himself
to
the
freeze
arctic
ray
of
Mrs.
Poyser
's
glance
.
<EOS>
Her
tongue
be
not
less
keen
than
her
eye
,
and
,
whenever
a
damsel
come
within
earshot
,
seem
to
take
up
an
unfinished
lecture
,
as
a
barrel

organ
take
up
a
tune
,
precisely
at
the
point
where
it
have
leave
off

<EOS>
the
fact
that
it
be
churn
day
be
another
reason
why
it
be
inconvenient
to
have
the
whittaw
,
and
why
,
consequently
,
Mrs.
Poyser
should
scold
Molly
the
housemaid
with
unusual
severity

right
that

should
rejoice

provide
for

so
that

if

it

raise
victual

just
get
a

for

<EOS>
not

you
could
afford
to
lose

you

it
be
poor

it

what
the

you
know
more
about

,
as
for

sir

I
canna

as
you
would

this
house
 
<EOS>
the
draught
in

enough
to
cut
you
through

it
be
my
opinion
<EOS>
the

be
very
rotten

the
rat

why

out

there
be
no

I
be
not

twenty

till
I
be
a
stout
gentleman

forty

my

would
never

<EOS>
"
well

in

some

ask

be
tired

to

what

be
never
have
a

allow
him

bad

as
I
have
say
to
my

often

often

I
be
sure

anything
to

it
would
not

not

them

up
early

after

the
Dairy

the

notion

pretty

<EOS>
It
be
of
little
use
for
me
to
tell
you
that
Hetty
's
cheek
be
like
a
rose
-
petal
,
<EOS>
that
dimple
play
about
her
pouting
lip
,
that
her
large
dark
eye
hide
a
soft
roguishness
under
their
long
lash
,
and
that
her
curly
hair
,
though
all
push
back
under
her
round
cap
while
she
be
at
work
,
steal
back
in
dark
delicate
ring
on
her
forehead
,
and
about
her
white
shell
-
like
ear
;
it
be
of
little
use
for
me
to
say
how
lovely
be
the
contour
of
her
pink
-
and
-
white
neckerchief
<EOS>
,
tuck
into
her
low
plum
-
colour
stuff
bodice
,
or
how
the
linen
butter
-
make
apron
,
with
its
bib
,
seem
a
thing
to
be
imitate
in
silk
by
duchess
,
since
it
fall
in
such
charming
line
,
or
how
her
brown
stocking
and
thick
-
sole
buckle
shoe
lose
all
that
clumsiness
which
they
must
certainly
have
have
when
empty
of
her
foot
and
ankle
 
of
little
use
,
unless
you
have
see
a
woman
who
affect
you
as
Hetty
affect
her
beholder
,
for
otherwise
,
though
you
may
conjure
up
the
image
of
a
lovely
woman
,
she
would
not
in
the
least
resemble
that
distract
kittenlike
maiden
.
<EOS>
I
may
mention
all
the
divine
charm
of
a
bright
spring
day
,
but
if
you
have
never
in
your
life
utterly
forget
yourself
in
strain
your
eye
after
the
mount
lark
,
or
in
wander
through
the
still
lane
when
the
fresh

open
blossom
fill
them
with
a
sacred
silent
beauty
like
that
of
fretted
aisle
,
where
would
be
the
use
of
my
descriptive
catalogue

<EOS>
I
could
never
make
you
know
what
I
mean
by
a
bright
spring
day

<EOS>
Hetty

be
a
spring
-
tide
beauty
;
it
be
the
beauty
of
young
frisk
thing
,
round
-
limbed
,
gambol
,
circumvent
you
by
a
false
air
of
innocence
 
the
innocence
of
a
young

-
browe
calf
,
for
example
,
that
,
be
incline
for
a
promenade
out
of
bound
,
lead
you
a
severe
steeplechase
over
hedge
and
ditch
,
and
only
come
to
a
stand
in
the
middle
of
a
bog
.
  
<EOS>
and
they
be
the
pretty
attitude
and
movement
into
which
a
pretty
girl
be
throw
in
make
up
butter
 
toss
movement
that
give
a
charming
curve
to
the
arm

and
a
sideward
inclination
of
the
round
white
neck
;
<EOS>
little
patting
and
rolling
movement
with
the
palm
of

and
nice
adaptation
and
finishing
which
can
not

all
be
effect
without
a
great
play
of
the
pout
mouth

the
dark

<EOS>
and
then
the
butter
itself
seem
to
communicate
a
fresh
charm
 
<EOS>
it
be
so
pure
,
so
sweet

scented
;
it
be
turn
off
the
mould
with
such
a
beautiful
firm
surface

like
marble

pale
yellow
light

<EOS>
moreover
,
Hetty
be
particularly
clever
at
make
up
the
butter
;
it
be
the
one
performance
of
hers
that
her
aunt
allow
to

handle
it

before

Mrs.

<EOS>
the
captain
continue
,
determine
to
make
Hetty

speak
to
him

<EOS>
Hetty
drop
the
pretty

steal
a
half

shy

half

coquettish

quite

at

the

"
  
<EOS>
the
proud
mother
,
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
to
show
her
Totty

pass
at

into

in
search
of

no

<EOS>
the
reason

there

space
for

tete

a

tete
can
only
be
know
by
look
into
the

where
Totty

discover
rub
a

be
thankful
for
the
privilege
I

from
my

childhood

and
have
you
be
long
in
the

of

for
I
understand
you
preach
at
Hayslope
last
night

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
first
take
to
the
work
four
year
since
,
when
I
be
twenty
-
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
Society
sanction
woman
's
preaching
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
It
do
not
forbid
them
,
sir
,
when
they
have
a
clear
call
to
the
work
,
and
when
their
ministry
be
own
by
the
conversion
of
sinner
and
the
strengthening
of
God
's
people
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fletcher
,
as
you
may
have
hear
about
,
be
the
first
woman
to
preach
in
the
Society
,
I
believe
,
before
she
be
marry
,
when
she
be
Miss
Bosanquet
;
and
Mr.
Wesley
approve
of
her
undertaking
the
work
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
great
gift
,
and
there
be
many
other
now
live
who
be
precious
fellow
-
helper
in
the
work
of
the
ministry
.
<EOS>
I
understand
there
be
be
voice
raise
against
it
in
the
Society
of
late
,
but
I
can
not
but
think
their
counsel
will
come
to
nought
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
for
man
to
make
channel
for
God
's
Spirit
,
as
they
make
channel
for
the
watercourse
,
and
say
,
"
flow
here
,
but
flow
not
there
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
do
not
you
find
some
danger
among
your
people
 
I
do
not
mean
to
say
that
it
be
so
with
you
,
far
from
it
 
but
do
not
you
find
sometimes
that
both
man
and
woman
fancy
themselves
channel
for
God
's
Spirit
,
and
be
quite
mistaken
,
so
that
they
set
about
a
work
for
which
they
be
unfit
and
bring
holy
thing
into
contempt
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
doubtless
<EOS>
it
be
so
sometimes
;
for
there
have
be
evil
-
doer
among
us
who
have
seek
to
deceive
the
brother
,
and
some
there
be
who
deceive
their
own
self
.
<EOS>
but
we
be
not
without
discipline
and
correction
to
put
a
check
upon
these
thing
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
very
strict
order
keep
among
us
,
and
the
brother
and
sister
watch
for
each
other
's
soul
as
they
that
must
give
account
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
go
every
one
his
own
way
and
say
,
"
be
I
my
brother
's
keeper
?
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
tell
me
 
if
I
may
ask
,
and
I
be
really
interested
in
know
it
 
how
you
first
come
to
think
of
preach
?
"
  
"
indeed
,
sir
,
I
do
not
think
of
it
at
all
 
<EOS>
I
would
be
use
from
the
time
I
be
sixteen
to
talk
to
the
little
child
,
and
teach
them
,
and
sometimes
I
have
have
my
heart
enlarge
to
speak
in
class
,
and
be
much
draw
out
in
prayer
with
the
sick
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
feel
no
call
to
preach
,
for
when
I
be
not
greatly
work
upon
,
I
be
too
much
give
to
sit
still
and
keep
by
myself
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
I
could
sit
silent
all
day
long
with
the
thought
of
God
overflow
my
soul
 
<EOS>
as
the
pebble
lie
bathe
in
the
Willow
Brook
.
<EOS>
for
thought
be
so
great
 
<EOS>
be
not
they
,
sir
?
<EOS>
They
seem
to
lie
upon
us
like
a
deep
flood
;
and
it
be
my
besetment
to
forget
where
I
be
and
everything
about
me
,
and
lose
myself
in
thought
that
I
could
give
no
account
of
,
for
I
could
neither
make
a
beginning
nor
end
of
them
in
word
.
<EOS>
that
be
my
way
as
long
as
I
can
remember
;
but
sometimes
it
seem
as
if
speech
come
to
me
without
any
will
of
my
own
,
and
word
be
give
to
me
that
come
out
as
the
tear
come
,
because
our
heart
be
full
and
we
can
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
and
those
be
always
time
of
great
blessing
,
though
I
have
never
think
it
could
be
so
with
me
before
a
congregation
of
people
.
<EOS>
but
,
sir
,
we
be
lead
on
,
like
the
little
child
,
by
a
way
that
we
know
not
.
<EOS>
I
be
call
to
preach
quite
suddenly
,
and
since
then
I
have
never
be
leave
in
doubt
about
the
work
that
be
lay
upon
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
tell
me
the
circumstance
 
just
how
it
be
,
the
very
day
you
begin
to
preach
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
one
Sunday
I
walk
with
brother
Marlowe
,
who
be
an
aged
man
,
one
of
the
local
preacher
,
all
the
way
to
Hetton
-
deep
 
<EOS>
that
be
a
village
where
the
people
get
their
living
by
work
in
the
lead
-
mine
,
and
where
there
be
no
church
nor
preacher
,
but
they
live
like
sheep
without
a
shepherd
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
than
twelve
mile
from
Snowfield
,
so
we
set
out
early
in
the
morning
,
for
it
be
summertime
;
and
I
have
a
wonderful
sense
of
the
Divine
love
as
we
walk
over
the
hill
,
where
there
be
no
tree
,
you
know
,
sir
,
as
there
be
here
,
to
make
the
sky
look
small
,
but
<EOS>
you
see
the
heavens
stretch
out
like
a
tent
,
and
you
feel
the
everlasting
arm
around
you
.
<EOS>
but
before
we
get
to
Hetton
,
brother
Marlowe
be
seize
with
a
dizziness
that
make
him
afraid
of
fall
,
for
he
overwork
himself
sadly
,
at
his
year
,
in
watch
and
pray
,
and
walk
so
many
mile
to
speak
the
Word
,
as
well
as
carry
on
his
trade
of
linen
-
weaving
.
<EOS>
and
when
we
get
to
the
village
,
the
people
be
expect
him
,
for
he
would
appoint
the
time
and
the
place
when
he
be
there
before
,
and
such
of
them
as
care
to
hear
the
Word
of
Life
be
assemble
on
a
spot
where
the
cottage
be
thickest
,
so
as
other
may
be
draw
to
come
.
<EOS>
but
he
feel
as
he
could
not
stand
up
to
preach
,
and
he
be
force
to
lie
down
in
the
first
of
the
cottage
we
come
to
.
<EOS>
so
I
go
to
tell
the
people
,
think
we
would
go
into
one
of
the
house
,
and
I
would
read
and
pray
with
them
.
<EOS>
but
as
I
pass
along
by
the
cottage
and
see
the
aged
and
tremble
woman
at
the
door
,
and
the
hard
look
of
the
man
,
who
seem
to
have
their
eye
no
more
fill
with
the
sight
of
the
Sabbath
morning
than
if
they
have
be
dumb
oxen
that
never
look
up
to
the
sky
,
I
feel
a
great
movement
in
my
soul
,
and
I
tremble
as
if
I
be
shake
by
a
strong
spirit
enter
into
my
weak
body
.
<EOS>
and
I
go
to
where
the
little
flock
of
people
be
gather
together
,
and
step
on
the
low
wall
that
be
build
against
the
green
hillside
,
and
I
speak
the
word
that
be
give
to
me
abundantly
.
<EOS>
and
they
all
come
round
me
out
of
all
the
cottage
,
and
many
weep
over
their
sin
,
and
have
since
be
join
to
the
Lord
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
beginning
of
my
preaching
,
sir
,
and
I
have
preach
ever
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
have
let
her
work
fall
during
this
narrative
,
which
she
utter
in
her
usual
simple
way
,
but
with
that
sincere
articulate
,
thrill
treble
by
which
she
always
master
her
audience
.
<EOS>
She
stoop
now
to
gather
up
her
sewing
,
and
then
go
on
with
it
as
before
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
be
deeply
interested
.
<EOS>
He
say
to
himself
,
"
He
must
be
a
miserable
prig
who
would
act
the
pedagogue
here
:
one
may
as
well
go
and
lecture
the
tree
for
grow
in
their
own
shape
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
never
feel
any
embarrassment
from
the
sense
of
your
youth
 
that
you
be
a
lovely
young
woman
on
whom
man
's
eye
be
fix
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
say
aloud
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
have
no
room
for
such
feeling
,
and
I
do
not
believe
the
people
ever
take
notice
about
that
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
sir
,
when
God
make
His
presence
feel
through
us
,
we
be
like
the
burn
bush
:
<EOS>
Moses
never
take
any
heed
what
sort
of
bush
<EOS>
it
be
 
<EOS>
he
only
see
the
brightness
of
the
Lord
.
<EOS>
I
have
preach
to
as
rough
ignorant
people
as
can
be
in
the
village
about
Snowfield
 
man
that
look
very
hard
and
wild
 
<EOS>
but
they
never
say
an
uncivil
word
to
me
,
and
often
thank
me
kindly
as
they
make
way
for
me
to
pass
through
the
midst
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
I
can
believe
 
that
I
can
well
believe
,
"
say
Mr.
Irwine
,
emphatically
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
what
do
you
think
of
your
hearer
last
night
,
now
?
<EOS>
do
you
find
them
quiet
and
attentive
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
very
quiet
,
sir
,
but
I
see
no
sign
of
any
great
work
upon
them
,
except
in
a
young
girl
name
Bessy
Cranage
,
towards
whom
my
heart
yearn
greatly
,
when
my
eye
first
fall
on
her
bloom
youth
,
give
up
to
folly
and
vanity
.
<EOS>
I
have
some
private
talk
and
prayer
with
her
afterwards
,
and
I
trust
her
heart
be
touch
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
notice
that
in
these
village
where
the
people
lead
a
quiet
life
among
the
green
pasture
and
the
still
water
,
till
the
ground
and
tend
the
cattle
,
there
be
a
strange
deadness
to
the
Word
,
as
different
as
can
be
from
the
great
town
,
like
Leeds
,
where
I
once
go
to
visit
a
holy
woman
who
preach
there
.
<EOS>
It
be
wonderful
how
rich
be
the
harvest
of
soul
up
those
high
-
walled
street
,
where
you
seem
to
walk
as
in
a
prison
-
yard
,
and
the
ear
be
deafen
with
the
sound
of
worldly
toil
.
<EOS>
I
think
maybe
it
be
because
the
promise
be
sweet
when
this
life
be
so
dark
and
weary
,
and
the
soul
get
more
hungry
when
the
body
be
ill
at
ease
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
yes
,
our
farm
-
labourer
be
not
easily
rouse

<EOS>
They
take
life
almost
as
slowly
as
the
sheep
and
cow

<EOS>
but
we
have
some
intelligent
workman
about
here

I

you
know
the
Bedes
;
Seth
Bede

the
by

a
Methodist

<EOS>
"
yes

I
know
Seth
well

and
his
brother
Adam
a
little

<EOS>
Seth
be
a
gracious
young
man
 
sincere
and
without
offence

and
Adam
be
like

patriarch
Joseph

kindness

night

Dinah

She
will
mourn
heavily

tell
me

of
an
anxious
,
troubled
heart

I
must
go
and
see
if
I
can

any
help

as

rise
and
be
begin
to
fold
up
her
work

exhaust
all

out

Mrs.

curtsy
duly
,
and
watch
the
two
horse
until
they
have
disappear
from
the
yard
,
amidst
great
excitement
on
the
part
of
the
pig

the
poultry

under
the
furious
indignation
of

to
threaten
the
breaking

Mrs.

delight
in

noisy
exit

fresh
assurance

yard

well
guard

<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser

however

though
she
notice
the

defer
remarking
on
it
until
she
have
disburden
herself
of
her
surprise
at
Mr.
Irwine
's
behaviour

<EOS>
"
why
,
Mr.
Irwine
be
not
angry
,
then
?
<EOS>
what
do
he
say
to
you
,
Dinah
?
<EOS>
do
not
he
scold
you
for
preach
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
he
be
not
at
all
angry
;
he
be
very
friendly
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
draw
out
to
speak
to
him
;
I
hardly
know
how
,
for
I
have
always
think
of
him
as
a
worldly
Sadducee
.
<EOS>
but
his
countenance
be
as
pleasant
as
the
morning
sunshine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
pleasant
!
<EOS>
and
what
else
do
y

expect
to
find
him
but
pleasant
?
"
say
Mrs.
Poyser
impatiently
,
resume
her
knitting
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
his
countenance
be
pleasant
indeed
!
<EOS>
and
him
a
gentleman
bear
,
and
be
get
a
mother
like
a
picter

<EOS>
You
may
go
the
country
round
and
not
find
such
another
woman
turn
sixty

six

<EOS>
It
be
summat
-
like
to
see
such
a
man
as
that
i
'
the
desk
of
a
Sunday
!
<EOS>
as
I
say
to
Poyser
,
it
be
like
look
at
a
full
crop
o
'
wheat
,
or
a
pasture
with
a
fine
dairy
o
'
cow
in
it
;
it
make
you
think
the
world
's
comfortable
-
like
.
<EOS>
but
as
for
such
creatur
as
you
Methodisses
run
after
,
I
would
as
soon
go
to
look
at
a
lot
o
'
bare

rib
runt
on
a
common

<EOS>
fine
folk
they
be
to
tell
you
what
be
right

as
look
as

they
would
never
taste
nothing
well
than
bacon

sword
and
sour

cake
<EOS>
i

their
life

<EOS>
but
what
do
Mr.
Irwine
say
to
you
about
that
fool
's
trick
o
'
preach
on
the
Green
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
only
say
he
would
hear
of
it
;
he
do
not
seem
to
feel
any
displeasure
about
it
.
<EOS>
but
,
dear
aunt
,
do
not
think
any
more
about
that
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
something
that
I
be
sure
will
cause
you
sorrow
,
as
it
do
me
.
<EOS>
Thias
Bede
be
drown
last
night
in
the
Willow
Brook
,
and
I
be
think
that
the
aged
mother
will
be
greatly
in
need
of
comfort
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
can
be
of
use
to
her

so
I
have
fetch
my

go
to
set
out

not

let
her

fall

suspect
that

exaggerating
with

didactic

"
no

my

no

<EOS>
"
oh

how
dreadful
!

Hetty

look
serious

not
deeply
affected

as
Molly
now
enter
with

she
take

silently

fragrant

off

I
be
afraid
Hetty
be
think
a
great
deal
more
of
the
look
Captain
Donnithorne
have
cast
at
her
than
of
Adam

his
trouble

<EOS>
bright
,
admire
glance
from
a
handsome
young
gentleman
with
white
hand
,
a
gold
chain
,
occasional
regimental
,
and
wealth
and
grandeur
immeasurable
 
<EOS>
those
be
the
warm
ray
that
set
poor
Hetty

heart
vibrate
and
play
its
little
foolish
tune
over

over
again

<EOS>
We
do
not
hear
that
Memnon

statue
give
forth
its
melody
at
all
under
the
rushing
of
the
mighty
wind
,
or
in
response
to
any
other
influence
divine
or
human
than
certain
short
-
live
sunbeam
of
morning
;
and
we
must
learn
to
accommodate
ourselves
to
the
discovery
that
some
of
those
cunningly
fashioned
instrument
call
human
soul
have
only
a
very
limited
range
of
music
,
and
will
not
vibrate
in
the
least
under
a
touch
that
fill
other
with
tremulous
rapture
or
quivering
agony
.
  
<EOS>
Hetty
be
quite
use
to
the
thought
that
people
like
to
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
blind
to
the
fact
that
young
Luke
Britton
of
Broxton
come
to
Hayslope
Church
on
a
Sunday
afternoon
on
purpose
that
he
may
see
her
;
and
that
he
would
have
make
much
more
decide
advance
if
her
uncle
Poyser
,
think
but
lightly
of
a
young
man
whose
father
's
land
be
so
foul
as
old
Luke
Britton
's
,
have
not
forbid
her
aunt
to
encourage
him
by
any
civility
.
<EOS>
She
be
aware
,
too
,
that
Mr.
Craig
,
the
gardener
at
the
Chase
,
be
over
head
and
ear
in
love
with
her
,
and
have
lately
make
unmistakable
avowal
in
luscious
strawberry
and
hyperbolical
pea
.
<EOS>
She
know
still
better
,
that
Adam
Bede
 
tall
,
upright
,
clever
,
brave
Adam
Bede
 
<EOS>
who
carry
such
authority
with
all
the
people
round
about
,
and
whom
her
uncle
be
always
delighted
to
see
of
an
evening
,
say
that
"
Adam
know
a
fine
sight
<EOS>
more
o
'
<EOS>
the
natur
o
'
thing
than
those
as
think
themselves
his
better
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
she
know
that
this
Adam
,
who
be
often
rather
stern
to
other
people
and
not
much
give
to
run
after
the
lass
,
could
be
make
to
turn
pale
or
red
any
day
by
a
word
or
a
look
from
her
.
<EOS>
Hetty
's
sphere
of
comparison
be
not
large
,
but
she
could
not
help
perceive
that
Adam
be
"
something
like
"
a
man
;
always
know
what
to
say
about
thing
,
could
tell
her
uncle
how
to
prop
the
hovel
,
and
have
mend
the
churn
in
no
time
;
know
,
with
only
look
at
it
,
the
value
of
the
chestnut
-
tree
that
be
blow
down
,
and
why
the
damp
come
in
the
wall
,
and
what
they
must
do
to
stop
the
rat
;
and
write
a
beautiful
hand
that
you
could
read
off
,
and
could
do
figure
in
his
head
 
a
degree
of
accomplishment
totally
unknown
among
the
rich
farmer
of
that
countryside
.
<EOS>
not
at
all
like
that
slouch
Luke
Britton
,
who
,
when
she
once
walk
with
him
all
the
way
from
Broxton
to
Hayslope
,
have
only
break
silence
to
remark
that
the
grey
goose
have
begin
to
lay
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
Mr.
Craig
,
the
gardener
,
he
be
a
sensible
man
enough
,
to
be
sure
,
but
he
be
knock
-
kneed
,
and
have
a
queer
sort
of
sing
-
song
in
his
talk
;
moreover
,
on
the
most
charitable
supposition
,
he
must
be
far
on
the
way
to
forty
.
  
<EOS>
Hetty
be
quite
certain
her
uncle
want
her
to
encourage
Adam
,
and
would
be
pleased
for
her
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
for
those
be
time
when
there
be
no
rigid
demarcation
of
rank
between
the
farmer
and
the
respectable
artisan
,
and
on
the
home
hearth
,
as
well
as
in
the
public
house
,
they
may
be
see
take
their
jug
of
ale
together
;
the
farmer
have
a
latent
sense
of
capital
,
and
of
weight
in
parish
affair
,
which
sustain
him
under
his
conspicuous
inferiority
in
conversation
.
<EOS>
Martin
Poyser
be
not
a
frequenter
of
public
house
,
but
he
like
a
friendly
chat
over
his
own
home
-
brew
;
and
though
it
be
pleasant
to
lay
down
the
law
to
a
stupid
neighbour
who
have
no
notion
how
to
make
the
good
of
his
farm
,
it
be
also
an
agreeable
variety
to
learn
something
from
a
clever
fellow
like
Adam
Bede
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
for
the
last
three
year
 
ever
since
he
have
superintend
the
building
of
the
new
barn
 
<EOS>
Adam
have
always
be
make
welcome
at
the
Hall
Farm
,
especially
of
a
winter
evening
,
when
the
whole
family
,
in
patriarchal
fashion
,
master
and
mistress
,
child
and
servant
,
be
assemble
in
that
glorious
kitchen
,
at
well
-
graduate
distance
from
the
blaze
fire
.
<EOS>
and
for
the
last
two
year
,
at
least
,
Hetty
have
be
in
the
habit
of
hear
her
uncle
say
,
"
Adam
Bede
may
be
work
for
wage
now
,
but
he
will
be
a
master
-
man
some
day
,
as
sure
as
I
sit
in
this
chair
.
<EOS>
Mester
Burge
be
in
the
right
on't
to
want
him
to
go
partner
and
marry
his
daughter
,
if
it
be
true
what
they
say
;
the
woman
as
marry
him
'
ull
have
a
good
take
,
be't
Lady
day
or
Michaelmas
,
"
a
remark
which
Mrs.
Poyser
always
follow
up
with
her
cordial
assent
.
<EOS>
"
ah
,
"
she
would
say
,
"
it
be
all
very
fine
have
a
ready

make
rich
man
,
but
mayhappen
he
will
be
a

make
fool

and
it

no

full

your

if
you

drive
you

he
will
soon
turn
you
over
into
the
ditch

<EOS>
I
allay
say
I
would
never
marry
a
man
as
have
get
no
brain
;
for
where
be
the
use
of
a
woman
have
brain
of
her
own
if
she
be
tackle
to
a
geck
as
everybody
be
a
-
laughing
at
?
<EOS>
She
may
as
well
dress
herself
fine
to
sit
back'ards
on
a
donkey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
these
expression
,
though
figurative
,
sufficiently
indicate
the
bent
of
Mrs.
Poyser
's
mind
with
regard
to
Adam
;
and
though
she
and
her
husband
may
have
view
the
subject
differently
if
Hetty
have
be
a
daughter
of
their
own
,
it
be
clear
that
they
would
have
welcome
the
match
with
Adam
for
a
penniless
niece
.
<EOS>
for
what
could
Hetty
have
be
but
a
servant
elsewhere
,
if
her
uncle
have
not
take
her
in
and
bring
her
up
as
a
domestic
help
to
her
aunt
,
whose
health
since
the
birth
of
Totty
have
not
be
equal
to
more
positive
labour
than
the
superintendence
of
servant
and
child
?
<EOS>
but
Hetty
have
never
give
Adam
any
steady
encouragement
.
<EOS>
even
in
the
moment
when
she
be
most
thoroughly
conscious
of
his
superiority
to
her
other
admirer
,
she
have
never
bring
herself
to
think
of
accept
him
.
<EOS>
She
like
to
feel
that
this
strong
,
skilful
,
keen
-
eyed
man
be
in
her
power
,
and
would
have
be
indignant
if
he
have
show
the
least
sign
of
slip
from
under
the
yoke
of
her
coquettish
tyranny
and
attach
himself
to
the
gentle
Mary
Burge
,
who
would
have
be
grateful
enough
for
the
most
trifling
notice
from
him
.
"
<EOS>
Mary
Burge
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
such
a
sallow

faced
girl

if
she
put
on
a

pink
ribbon

she
look
as
yellow
as
a
crow
-
flower
and
her
hair
<EOS>
be
as
straight
as
a
hank
of
cotton
.
"
<EOS>
and
always
when
Adam
stay
away
for
several
week
from
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
otherwise
make
some
show
of
resistance
to
his
passion
as
a
foolish
one
,
Hetty
take
care
to
entice
him
back
into
the
net
by
little
air
of
meekness
and
timidity
,
as
if
she
be
in
trouble
at
his
neglect
.
<EOS>
but
as
to
marry
Adam
,
that
be
a
very
different
affair
!
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
in
the
world
to
tempt
her
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
Her
cheek
never
grow
a
shade
deeper
when
his
name
be
mention
;
she
feel
no
thrill
when
she
see
him
pass
along
the
causeway
by
the
window
,
or
advance
towards
her
unexpectedly
in
the
footpath
across
the
meadow
;
she
feel
nothing
,
when
his
eye
rest
on
her
,
but
the
cold
triumph
of
know
that
he
love
her
and
would
not
care
to
look
at
Mary
Burge
.
<EOS>
He
could
no
more
stir
in
her
the
emotion
that
make
the
sweet
intoxication
of
young
love
than
the
mere
picture
of
a
sun
can
stir
the
spring
sap
in
the
subtle
fibre
of
the
plant
.
<EOS>
She
see
him
as
he
be
 
a
poor
man
with
old
parent
to
keep
,
who
would
not
be
able
,
for
a
long
while
to
come
,
to
give
her
even
such
luxury
as
she
share
in
her
uncle
's
house
.
<EOS>
and
Hetty
's
dream
be
all
of
luxury
:
to
sit
in
a
carpet
parlour
,
and
always
wear
white
stocking
;
to
have
some
large
beautiful
ear
-
ring
,
such
as
be
all
the
fashion
;
to
have
Nottingham
lace
round
the
top
of
her
gown
,
and
something
to
make
her
handkerchief
smell
nice
,
like
Miss
Lydia
Donnithorne
's
when
she
draw
it
out
at
church
;
and
not
to
be
oblige
to
get
up
early
or
be
scold
by
anybody
.
<EOS>
She
think
,
if
Adam
have
be
rich
and
could
have
give
her
these
thing
,
she
love
him
well
enough
to
marry
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
for
the
last
few
week
a
new
influence
have
come
over
Hetty
 
<EOS>
vague
,
atmospheric
,
shape
itself
into
no
self
-
confess
hope
or
prospect
,
but
produce
a
pleasant
narcotic
effect
,
make
her
tread
the
ground
and
go
about
her
work
in
a
sort
of
dream
,
unconscious
of
weight
or
effort
,
and
show
her
all
thing
through
a
soft
,
liquid
veil
,
as
if
she
be
live
not
in
this
solid
world
of
brick
and
stone
,
but
in
a
beatified
world
,
such
as
the
sun
light
up
for
us
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
Hetty
have
become
aware
that
Mr.
Arthur
Donnithorne
would
take
a
good
deal
of
trouble
for
the
chance
of
see
her
;
that
he
always
place
himself
at
church
so
as
to
have
the
full
view
of
her
both
sit
and
stand
;
that
he
be
constantly
find
reason
for
call
at
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
always
would
contrive
to
say
something
for
the
sake
of
make
her
speak
to
him
and
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
the
poor
child
no
more
conceive
at
present
the
idea
that
the
young
squire
could
ever
be
her
lover
than
a
baker
's
pretty
daughter
in
the
crowd
,
whom
a
young
emperor
distinguishe
by
an
imperial
but
admire
smile
,
conceive
that
she
shall
be
make
empress
.
<EOS>
but
the
baker
's
daughter
go
home
and
dream
of
the
handsome
young
emperor
,
and
perhaps
weigh
the
flour
amiss
while
she
be
think
what
a
heavenly
lot
it
must
be
to
have
him
for
a
husband
.
<EOS>
and
so
,
poor
Hetty
have
get
a
face
and
a
presence
haunt
her
waking
and
sleep
dream
;
bright
,
soft
glance
have
penetrate
her
,
and
suffuse
her
life
with
a
strange
,
happy
languor
.
<EOS>
the
eye
that
shed
those
glance
be
really
not
half
so
fine
as
Adam
's
,
which
sometimes
look
at
her
with
a
sad
,
beseech
tenderness
,
but
they
have
find
a
ready
medium
in
Hetty
's
little
silly
imagination
,
whereas
Adam
's
could
get
no
entrance
through
that
atmosphere
.
<EOS>
for
three
week
,
at
least
,
her
inward
life
have
consist
of
little
else
than
live
through
in
memory
the
look
and
word
Arthur
have
direct
towards
her
 
of
little
else
than
recall
the
sensation
with
which
she
hear
his
voice
outside
the
house
,
and
see
him
enter
,
and
become
conscious
that
his
eye
be
fix
on
her
,
and
then
become
conscious
that
a
tall
figure
,
look
down
on
her
with
eye
that
seem
to
touch
her
,
be
come
nearer
in
clothe
of
beautiful
texture
with
an
odour
like
that
of
a
flower
-
garden
borne
on
the
evening
breeze
.
<EOS>
foolish
thought
!
<EOS>
but
all
this
happen
,
you
must
remember
,
nearly
sixty
year
ago
,
and
Hetty
be
quite
uneducated
 
a
simple
farmer
's
girl
,
to
whom
a
gentleman
with
a
white
hand
be
dazzle
as
an
olympian
god
.
<EOS>
until
to
-
day
,
she
have
never
look
farther
into
the
future
than
to
the
next
time
Captain
Donnithorne
would
come
to
the
Farm
,
or
the
next
Sunday
when
she
should
see
him
at
church
;
but
now
she
think
,
perhaps
he
would
try
to
meet
her
when
she
go
to
the
Chase
to
-
morrow
 
<EOS>
and
if
he
should
speak
to
her
,
and
walk
a
little
way
,
when
nobody
be
by
!
<EOS>
that
have
never
happen
yet
;
and
now
her
imagination
,
instead
of
retrace
the
past
,
be
busy
fashion
what
would
happen
to
-
morrow
 
<EOS>
whereabout
in
the
Chase
<EOS>
she
should
see
him
come
towards
her
<EOS>
,
how
she
should
put
her
new
rise
-
colour
ribbon
on
,
which
he
have
never
see
,
and
what
he
would
say
to
her
to
make
her
return
his
glance
 
a
glance
which
she
would
be
live
through
in
her
memory
,
over
and
over
again
,
all
the
rest
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
state
of
mind
,
how
could
Hetty
give
any
feeling
to
Adam
's
trouble
,
or
think
much
about
poor
old
Thias
be
drown
?
<EOS>
young
soul
,
in
such
pleasant
delirium
as
her
be
as
unsympathetic
as
butterfly
sip
nectar
;
they
be
isolate
from
all
appeal
by
a
barrier
of
dream
 
by
invisible
look
and
impalpable
arm
.
  
<EOS>
while
Hetty
's
hand
be
busy
pack
up
the
butter
,
and
her
head
fill
with
these
picture
of
the
morrow
,
Arthur
Donnithorne
,
ride
by
Mr.
Irwine
's
side
towards
the
valley
of
the
Willow
Brook
,
have
also
certain
indistinct
anticipation
,
run
as
an
undercurrent
in
his
mind
while
he
be
listen
to
Mr.
Irwine
's
account
of
Dinah
 
indistinct
,
yet
strong
enough
to
make
him
feel
rather
conscious
when
Mr.
Irwine
suddenly
say
,
"
what
fascinate
you
so
in
Mrs.
Poyser
's
dairy
,
Arthur
?
<EOS>
have
you
become
an
amateur
of
damp
quarry
and
skim
dish
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
know
the
rector
too
well
to
suppose
that
a
clever
invention
would
be
of
any
use
,
so
he
say
,
with
his
accustomed
frankness
,
"
no
,
I
go
to
look
at
the
pretty
butter
-
maker
Hetty
Sorrel
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
perfect
Hebe
;
and
if
I
be
an
artist
,
I
would
paint
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
amazing
what
pretty
girl
one
see
among
the
farmer
'
daughter
,
when
the
man
be
such
clown
.
<EOS>
that
common
,
round
,
red
face
one
see
sometimes
in
the
man
 
all
cheek
and
no
feature
,
like
Martin
Poyser
's
 
come
out
in
the
woman
of
the
family
as
the
most
charming
phiz
imaginable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
have
no
objection
to
your
contemplating
Hetty
in
an
artistic
light
,
but
I
must
not
have
you
feed
her
vanity
and
fill
her
little
noddle
with
the
notion
that
she
be
a
great
beauty
,
attractive
to
fine
gentleman
,
or
you
will
spoil
her
for
a
poor
man
's
wife
 
honest
Craig
's
,
for
example
,
whom
I
have
see
bestow
soft
glance
on
her
.
<EOS>
the
little
puss
seem
already
to
have
air
enough
to
make
a
husband
as
miserable
as
it
be
a
law
of
nature
for
a
quiet
man
to
be
when
he
marry
a
beauty
.
<EOS>
Apropos
of
marrying
<EOS>
,
I
hope
our
friend
Adam
will
get
settle
,
now
the
poor
old
man
be
go
.
<EOS>
He
will
only
have
his
mother
to
keep
in
future
,
and
I
have
a
notion
that
there
be
a
kindness
between
him
and
that
nice
modest
girl
,
Mary
Burge
,
from
something
that
fall
from
old
Jonathan
one
day
when
I
be
talk
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
when
I
mention
the
subject
to
Adam
he
look
uneasy
and
turn
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
love
-
making
do
not
run
smooth
,
or
perhaps
Adam
hang
back
till
he
be
in
a
well
position
.
<EOS>
He
have
independence
of
spirit
enough
for
two
man
 
rather
an
excess
of
pride
,
if
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
would
be
a
capital
match
for
Adam
.
<EOS>
He
would
slip
into
old
Burge
's
shoe
and
make
a
fine
thing
of
that
building
business
,
I
will
answer
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
see
him
well
settle
in
this
parish
;
he
would
be
ready
then
to
act
as
my
grand
-
vizier
when
I
want
one
.
<EOS>
We
could
plan
no
end
of
repair
and
improvement
together
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
see
the
girl
,
though
,
I
think
 
at
least
I
have
never
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
look
at
her
next
Sunday
at
church
 
<EOS>
she
sit
with
her
father
on
the
left
of
the
reading
-
desk
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
look
quite
so
much
at
Hetty
Sorrel
then
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
make
up
my
mind
that
I
can
not
afford
to
buy
a
tempting
dog
,
I
take
no
notice
of
him
,
because
if
he
take
a
strong
fancy
to
me
and
look
lovingly
at
me
,
the
struggle
between
arithmetic
and
inclination
may
become
unpleasantly
severe
.
<EOS>
I
pique
myself
on
my
wisdom
there
,
Arthur
,
and
as
an
old
fellow
to
whom
wisdom
have
become
cheap
,
I
bestow
it
upon
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
.
<EOS>
It
may
stand
me
in
good
stead
some
day
though
I
do
not
know
that
I
have
any
present
use
for
it
.
<EOS>
bless
me
!
<EOS>
how
the
brook
have
overflow
.
<EOS>
suppose
we
have
a
canter
,
now
we
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
that
be
the
great
advantage
of
dialogue
on
horseback
;
it
can
be
merge
any
minute
into
a
trot
or
a
canter
,
and
one
may
have
escape
from
Socrates
himself
in
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
the
two
friend
be
free
from
the
necessity
of
further
conversation
till
they
pull
up
in
the
lane
behind
Adam
's
cottage
.
    
<EOS>
Dinah
Visits
<EOS>
Lisbeth
  
<EOS>
at
five
o'clock
<EOS>
Lisbeth
come
downstairs
with
a
large
key
in
her
hand
:
it
be
the
key
of
the
chamber
where
her
husband
lie
dead
.
<EOS>
throughout
the
day
,
except
in
her
occasional
outburst
of
wail
grief
,
she
have
be
in
incessant
movement
,
perform
the
initial
duty
to
her
dead
with
the
awe
and
exactitude
that
belong
to
religious
rite
.
<EOS>
She
have
bring
out
her
little
store
of
bleached
linen
,
which
she
have
for
long
year
keep
in
reserve
for
this
supreme
use
.
<EOS>
It
seem
but
yesterday
 
that
time
so
many
midsummer
ago
,
when
she
have
tell
Thias
where
this
linen
lie
,
that
he
may
be
sure
and
reach
it
out
for
her
when
she
die
,
for
she
be
the
elder
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
then
there
have
be
the
work
of
cleanse
to
the
strict
purity
<EOS>
every
object
in
the
sacred
chamber
,
and
of
remove
from
it
every
trace
of
common
daily
occupation
.
<EOS>
the
small
window
,
which
have
hitherto
freely
let
in
the
frosty
moonlight
or
the
warm
summer
sunrise
on
the
work
man
's
slumber
,
must
now
be
darken
with
a
fair
white
sheet
,
for
this
be
the
sleep
which
be
as
sacred
under
the
bare
rafter
as
in
ceile
house
.
<EOS>
Lisbeth
have
even
mend
a
long
-
neglect
and
unnoticeable
rent
in
the
checkered
bit
of
bed
-
curtain
;
for
the
moment
be
few
and
precious
now
in
which
she
would
be
able
to
do
the
small
office
of
respect
or
love
for
the
still
corpse
,
to
which
in
all
her
thought
she
attribute
some
consciousness
.
<EOS>
Our
dead
be
never
dead
to
us
until
we
have
forget
them
:
they
can
be
injure
by
us
,
they
can
be
wound
;
they
know
all
our
penitence
,
all
our
aching
sense
that
their
place
be
empty
,
all
the
kiss
we
bestow
on
the
small
relic
of
their
presence
.
<EOS>
and
the
aged
peasant
woman
most
of
all
believe
that
her
dead
be
conscious
.
<EOS>
decent
burial
be
what
Lisbeth
have
be
think
of
for
herself
through
year
of
thrift
,
with
an
indistinct
expectation
that
she
should
know
when
she
be
be
carry
to
the
churchyard
,
follow
by
her
husband
and
her
son
;
and
now
she
feel
as
if
the
great
work
of
her
life
be
to
be
do
in
see
that
Thias
be
bury
decently
before
her
 
under
the
white
thorn
,
where
once
,
in
a
dream
,
she
have
think
she
lie
in
the
coffin
,
yet
all
the
while
see
the
sunshine
above
and
smell
the
white
blossom
that
be
so
thick
upon
the
thorn
the
Sunday
<EOS>
she
go
to
be
church
after
Adam
be
bear
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
she
have
do
everything
that
could
be
do
to
-
day
in
the
chamber
of
death
 
<EOS>
have
do
it
all
herself
,
with
some
aid
from
her
son
in
lifting
,
for
she
would
let
no
one
be
fetched
to
help
her
from
the
village
,
not
be
fond
of
female
neighbour
generally
;
and
her
favourite
dolly
,
the
old
housekeeper
at
Mr.
Burge
's
,
who
have
come
to
condole
with
her
in
the
morning
as
soon
as
she
hear
of
Thias
's
death
,
be
too
dim
-
sighted
to
be
of
much
use
.
<EOS>
She
have
lock
the
door
,
and
now
hold
the
key
in
her
hand
,
as
she
throw
herself
wearily
into
a
chair
that
stand
out
of
its
place
in
the
middle
of
the
house
floor
,
where
in
ordinary
time
she
would
never
have
consent
to
sit
.
<EOS>
the
kitchen
have
have
none
of
her
attention
that
day
;
it
be
soil
with
the
tread
of
muddy

object
out

<EOS>
but
what
at
another
time
would
have
be
intolerable
to
Lisbeth
's
habit
of
order
and
cleanliness
<EOS>
seem
to
her
now
just
what
should
be
:
<EOS>
it
be
right
that
thing
should
look
strange
and
disorder
and
wretched
,
now
the
old
man
have
come
to
his
end
in
that
sad
way
;
the
kitchen
ought
not
to
look
as
if
nothing
have
happen
.
<EOS>
Adam
,
overcome
with
the
agitation
and
exertion
of
the
day
after
his
night
of
hard
work
,
have
fall
asleep
on
a
bench
in
the
workshop
;
and
Seth
be
in
the
back
kitchen
make
a
fire
of
stick
that
he
may
get
the
kettle
to
boil
,
and
persuade
his
mother
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
,
an
indulgence
which
she
rarely
allow
herself
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
one
in
the
kitchen
when
Lisbeth
enter
and
throw
herself
into
the
chair
.
<EOS>
She
look
round
with
blank
eye
at
the
dirt
and
confusion
on
which
the
bright
afternoon
's
sun
shine
dismally
;
it
be
all
of
a
piece
with
the
sad
confusion
of
her
mind
 
<EOS>
that
confusion
which
belong
to
the
first
hour
of
a
sudden
sorrow
,
when
the
poor
human
soul
be
like
one
who
have
be
deposit
sleep
among
the
ruin
of
a
vast
city
,
and
wake
up
in
dreary
amazement
,
not
know
whether
it
be
the
grow
or
the
die
day
 
not
know
why
and
whence
come
this
illimitable
scene
of
desolation
,
or
why
he
too
find
himself
desolate
in
the
midst
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
at
another
time
Lisbeth
's
first
thought
would
have
be
,
"
where
be
Adam
?
"
<EOS>
but
the
sudden
death
of
her
husband
have
restore
him
in
these
hour
to
that
first
place
in
her
affection
which
he
have
hold
six
-
and
-
twenty
year
ago
.
<EOS>
She
have
forget
his
fault
as
we
forget
the
sorrow
of
our
depart
childhood
,
and
thought
of
nothing
but
the
young
husband
's
kindness
and
the
old
man
's
patience
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
continue
to
wander
blankly
until
Seth
come
in
and
begin
to
remove
some
of
the
scatter
thing
,
and
clear
the
small
round
deal
table
that
he
may
set
out
his
mother
's
tea
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
what

<EOS>
she

rather
peevishly

<EOS>
"

Seth

tenderly

backwards
and
forwards
on

<EOS>
Seth
,
always
timid
in
his
behaviour
towards

,
from
the
sense
that
he
have
no

over

,
feel
it
be
useless
to
attempt
to
persuade
or
soothe
her
till
this
passion
be
past
;
so
he
content
himself
with
tend
the
back

and
fold
up
his

's
clothe
,
which
have
be
hang

afraid

about

after

have

rock
herself
and

for

she
suddenly
pause
and

aloud
to
herself
,

Seth
overhear
this
,
and
come
into

again

as

from

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
be
seat
on
a
rough
bench
,
his
head
support
by
his
arm
,
which
rest
from
the
shoulder
to
the
elbow
on
the
long
planing
-
table
in
the
middle
of
the
workshop
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
he
have
sit
down
for
a
few
minute
'
rest
and
have
fall
asleep
without
slip
from
his
first
attitude
of
sad
,
fatigued
thought
.
<EOS>
His
face
,
unwashe
since
yesterday
,
look
pallid
and
clammy
;
his
hair
be
toss
shaggily
about
his
forehead
,
and
his
close
eye
have
the
sunken
look
which
follow
upon
watch
and
sorrow
.
<EOS>
His
brow
be
knit
,
and
his
whole
face
have
an
expression
of
weariness
and
pain
.
<EOS>
Gyp
be
evidently
uneasy
,
for
he
sit
on
his
haunch
,
rest
his
nose
on
his
master
's
stretch
-
out
leg
,
and
divide
the
time
between
lick
the
hand
that
hang
listlessly
down
and
glance
with
a
listen
air
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
the
poor
dog
be
hungry
and
restless
,
but
would
not
leave
his
master
,
and
be
wait
impatiently
for
some
change
in
the
scene
.
<EOS>
It
be
owe
to
this
feeling
on
Gyp
's
part
that
,
when
Lisbeth
come
into
the
workshop
and
advanced
towards
Adam
as
noiselessly
as
she
could
,
her
intention
not
to
awaken
him
be
immediately
defeat
;
for
Gyp
's
excitement
be
too
great
to
find
vent
in
anything
short
of
a
sharp
bark
,
and
in
a
moment
Adam
open
his
eye
and
see
his
mother
stand
before
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
very
unlike
his
dream
,
for
his
sleep
have
be
little
more
than
live
through
again
,
in
a
fevered
delirious
way
,
all
that
have
happen
since
daybreak
,
and
his
mother
with
her
fretful
grief
be
present
to
him
through
it
all
.
<EOS>
the
chief
difference
between
the
reality
and
the
vision
be
that
in
his
dream
Hetty
be
continually
come
before
him
in
bodily
presence
 
strangely
mingle
herself
as
an
actor
in
scene
with
which
she
have
nothing
to
do
.
<EOS>
She
be
even
by
the
Willow
Brook
;
she
make
his
mother
angry
by
come
into
the
house
;
and
he
meet
her
with
her
smart
clothe
quite
wet
through
,
as
he
walk
in
the
rain
to
Treddleston
,
to
tell
the
coroner
.
<EOS>
but
wherever
Hetty
come
,
his
mother
be
sure
to
follow
soon
;
and
when
he
open
his
eye
,
it
be
not
at
all
startling
to
see
her
standing
near
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
eh

my

my

<EOS>
Lisbeth
burst
out
immediately
,
her
wail

,
for
grief
in
its
freshness
feel
the
need
of
associate
its
loss
and
its
lament
with
every
change
of
scene
and
incident
,

he
could
not

otherwise

It
be
not

down
again

weary

out

over

presently
induce

this
pause

a
relief

say
no

quietly
take

then
,
motion
silence
to
Seth
,
who
,
on
hear
her
voice
,
have
come
in
with
a
beat
heart
,
lay
one
hand
on
the
back
of
Lisbeth
's
chair
and
lean
over
her
,
that
she
may
be
aware
of
a
friendly
presence
.
  
<EOS>
slowly
Lisbeth
draw
down
her
apron
,
and
timidly
she
open
her
dim
dark
eye
.
<EOS>
She
see
nothing
at
first
<EOS>
but
a
face
 
<EOS>
a
pure
,
pale
face
,
with
love
grey
eye
,
and
<EOS>
it
be
quite
unknown
to
her
.
<EOS>
Her
wonder
increase
;
perhaps
it
be
an
angel
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
same
instant
Dinah
have
lay
her
hand
on
Lisbeth
's
again
,
and
the
old
woman
look
down
at
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
much
small
hand
than
her
own
,
but
it
be
not
white
and
delicate
,
for
Dinah
have
never
wear
a
glove
in
her
life
,
and
her
hand
bear
the
trace
of
labour
from
her
childhood
upwards
.
<EOS>
Lisbeth
look
earnestly
at
the
hand
for
a
moment
,
and
then
,
fix
her
eye
again
on
Dinah
's
face
,
say
,
with
something
of
restored
courage
,
but
in
a
tone
of
surprise
,
"
why
,
ye're
a
workin
'
woman
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
be
Dinah

"

say
Lisbeth
slowly
,
still

;
"

Dinah
take
care
not
to
betray
that
she
have
have
her
tea
,
and
accept
Lisbeth

invitation
very
readily
,
for
the
sake
of
persuade
the
old
woman
herself
to
take
the
food
and
drink
she
so
much
need
after
a
day
of
hard
work

fasting

<EOS>
Seth
be
so
happy
<EOS>
now
Dinah
be
in
the
house
that
he
could
not
help
think
her
presence
be
worth
purchase
with
a
life
in
which
grief
incessantly
follow
upon
grief
;
but
the
next
moment
he
reproach
himself
 
<EOS>
it
be
almost
as
if
he
be
rejoice
in
his
father
's
sad
death

<EOS>
nevertheless
the
joy
of
be
with
Dinah
WOULD
triumph
 
<EOS>
it
be
like
the
influence
of
climate
,
which
no
resistance
can
overcome

and
the
feeling
even
suffuse
itself
over
his

so
as
to
attract
his

notice

be
drink
her

Dinah
,
see
that

tell
her
the

how
she
have
be
bring
up

what
sort

Snowfield
be

how
many
people
have
a
hard
life
there
 
all
the
detail
that
she
think
likely
to
interest
Lisbeth

<EOS>
the
old

listen
,

forget
to
be
fretful

unconsciously
subject
to
the
soothing
influence

after
a
while
she
be
persuade

let

make
tidy

for
Dinah
be
bent
on
this
,
believe
that
the
sense

order

quietude
around
her
would
help
in
dispose
Lisbeth
to
join

prayer
she
long

forth
at

side

Seth

meanwhile

go
out

he
surmise
that

would

with
his

<EOS>
Lisbeth
sit
watch
her
as
she
move
about

at

would
neither
eat
nor
drink
,
but
lie
on
the
ground
all
night
,
beseech
God
for
the
child
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
know
it
be
dead
,
he
rise
up
from
the
ground
and
wash
and
anoint
himself
,
and
change
his
clothe
,
and
eat
and
drank
;
and
when
they
ask
him
how
it
be
that
he
seem
to
have
leave
off
grieve
now
the
child
be
dead
,
he
say
,
"
while
the
child

yet
alive

I
fast
and
weep
;
for
I
say
,
who
can
tell
whether
God
will
be
gracious
to
me
,
that
the
child
may
live
?
<EOS>
but
now
he
be
dead
,
<EOS>
wherefore
should
I
fast
?
<EOS>
Can
I
bring
him
back
again
?
<EOS>
I
shall
go
to
him
,
but
he
shall
not
return
to
me

"
<EOS>
"
  
"
eh
,
that
be
a
true
word
,
"
say
Lisbeth
.
<EOS>
"
yea
,
my
old
man

I

"

<EOS>
"
  
Dinah
and
Seth
be
both
inwardly
offer
thank
for
the
great
quietness
of
spirit
that
have
come
over
Lisbeth
.
<EOS>
this
be
what
Dinah
have
be
try
to
bring
about
,
through
all
her
still
sympathy
and
absence
from
exhortation
.
<EOS>
from
her
girlhood
upwards
she
have
have
experience
among
the
sick
and
the
mourning
,
among
mind
harden
and
shrivel
through
poverty
and
ignorance
,
and
have
gain
the
subtle
perception
of
the
mode
in
which
they
could
best
be
touch
and
soften
into
willingness
to
receive
word
of
spiritual
consolation
or
warning
.
<EOS>
as
Dinah
express
it
,
"
she
be
never
leave
to
herself
;
but
it
be
always
give
her
when
to
keep
silence
and
when
to
speak
.
"
<EOS>
and
do
we
not
all
agree
to
call
rapid
thought
and
noble
impulse
by
the
name
of
inspiration
?
<EOS>
after
our
subtle
analysis
of
the
mental
process
,
we
must
still
say
,
as
Dinah
do
,
that
our
high
thought
and
our
good
deed
be
all
give
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
there
be
earnest
prayer
 
<EOS>
there
be
faith
,
love
,
and
hope
pour
forth
that
evening
in
the
little
kitchen
.
<EOS>
and
poor
,
aged
,
fretful
Lisbeth
,
without
grasp
any
distinct
idea
,
without
go
through
any
course
of
religious
emotion
,
feel
a
vague
sense
of
goodness
and
love
,
and
of
something
right
lie
underneath
and
beyond
all
this
sorrow
life
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
understand
the
sorrow
;
but
,
for
these
moment
,
under
the
subdue
influence
of
Dinah
's
spirit
,
she
feel
that
she
must
be
patient
and
still
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
Cottage
  
<EOS>
it
be
but
half
-
past
four
<EOS>
the
next
morning
when
Dinah
,
tired
of
lie
awake
listening
to
the
bird
and
watch
the
grow
light
through
the
little
window
in
the
garret
roof
,
rise
and
begin
to
dress
herself
very
quietly
,
lest
she
should
disturb
Lisbeth
.
<EOS>
but
already
some
one
else
be
astir
in
the
house
,
and
have
go
downstairs
,
precede
by
Gyp
.
<EOS>
the
dog
's
pattering
step
be
a
sure
sign
that
it
be
Adam
who
go
down
;
but
Dinah
be
not
aware
of
this
,
and
she
think
it
be
more
likely
to
be
Seth
,
for
he
have
tell
her
how
Adam
have
stay
up
work
the
night
before
.
<EOS>
Seth
,
however
,
have
only
just
awaken
at
the
sound
of
the
opening
door
.
<EOS>
the
exciting
influence
of
the
previous
day
,
heighten
at
last
by
Dinah
's
unexpected
presence
,
have
not
be
counteract
by
any
bodily
weariness
,
for
he
have
not
do
his
ordinary
amount
of
hard
work
;
and
so
when
he
go
to
bed
;
it
be
not
till
he
have
tired
himself
with
hour
of
toss
wakefulness
that
drowsiness
come
,
and
lead
on
a
heavy
morning
sleep
than
be
usual
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
Adam
have
be
refresh
by
his
long
rest
,
and
with
his
habitual
impatience
of
mere
passivity
,
he
be
eager
to
begin
the
new
day
and
subdue
sadness
by
his
strong
will
and
strong
arm
.
<EOS>
the
white
mist
lie
in
the
valley
;
it
be
go
to
be
a
bright
warm
day
,
and
he
would
start
to
work
again
when
he
have
have
his
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
be
bearable
as
long
as
a
man
can
work
,
"
he
say
to
himself
;
"
the
natur
o
'
thing
do
not
change
,
though
it
seem
as
if
one
's
own
life
be
nothing
but
change
.
<EOS>
the
square
o
'
four
be
sixteen
,
and
you
must
lengthen
your
lever
in
proportion
to
your
weight
,
be
as
true
when
a
man
's
miserable
as
when
he
be
happy
;
and
the
good
o
'
working
be
,
it
give
you
a
grip
hold
<EOS>
o
'
thing
outside
your
own
lot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
he
dash
the
cold
water
over
his
head
and
face
,
he
feel
completely
himself
again
,
and
with
his
black
eye
as
keen
as
ever
and
his
thick
black
hair
all
glisten
with
the
fresh
moisture
,
he
go
into
the
workshop
to
look
out
the
wood
for
his
father
's
coffin
,
intend
that
he
and
Seth
should
carry
it
with
them
to
Jonathan
Burge
's
and
have
the
coffin
make
by
one
of
the
workman
there
,
so
that
his
mother
may
not
see
and
hear
the
sad
task
go
forward
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
just
go
into
the
workshop
when
his
quick
ear
detect
a
light
rapid
foot
on
the
stair
 
certainly
not
his
mother
's
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
in
bed
and
asleep
when
Dinah
have
come
in
,
in
the
evening
,
and
now
he
wonder
whose
step
this
could
be
.
<EOS>
a
foolish
thought
come
,
and
move
him
strangely
.
<EOS>
as
if
it
could
be
Hetty
!
<EOS>
She
be
the
last
person
likely
to
be
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
and
yet
he
feel
reluctant
to
go
and
look
and
have
the
clear
proof
that
it
be
some
one
else
.
<EOS>
He
stand
lean
on
a
plank
he
have
take
hold
of
,
listen
to
sound
which
his
imagination
interpret
for
him
so
pleasantly
that
the
keen
strong
face
become
suffused
with
a
timid
tenderness
.
<EOS>
the
light
footstep
move
about
the
kitchen
,
follow
by
the
sound
of
the
sweeping
brush
,
hardly
make
so
much
noise
as
the
light
breeze
that
chase
the
autumn
leave
along
the
dusty
path
;
and
Adam
's
imagination
see
a
dimpled
face
,
with
dark
bright
eye
and
roguish
smile
look
backward
at
this
brush
,
and
a
rounded
figure
just
lean
a
little
to
clasp
the
handle
.
<EOS>
a
very
foolish
thought
 
it
could
not
be
Hetty
;
but
the
only
way
of
dismiss
such
nonsense
from
his
head
be
to
go
and
see
who
it
be
,
for
his
fancy
only
get
nearer
and
nearer
to
belief
while
he
stand
there
listen
.
<EOS>
He
loose
the
plank
and
go
to
the
kitchen
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
do
,
Adam
Bede
?
"
say
Dinah
,
in
her
calm
treble
,
pause
from
her
sweep
and
fix
her
mild
grave
eye
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
trust
you
feel
rest
and
strengthen
again
to
bear
the
burden
and
heat
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
like
dream
of
the
sunshine
and
awake
in
the
moonlight
.
<EOS>
Adam
have
see
Dinah
several
time
,
but
always
at
the
Hall
Farm
,
where
he
be
not
very
vividly
conscious
of
any
woman
's
presence
except
Hetty
's
,
and
he
have
only
in
the
last
day
or
two
begin
to
suspect
that
Seth
be
in
love
with
her
,
so
that
his
attention
have
not
hitherto
be
draw
towards
her
for
his
brother
's
sake
.
<EOS>
but
now
her
slim
figure
,
her
plain
black
gown
,
and
her
pale
serene
face
impress
him
with
all
the
force
that
belong
to
a
reality
contrast
with
a
preoccupying
fancy
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
moment
or
two
he
make
no
answer
,
but
look
at
her
with
the
concentrated
,
examine
glance
which
a
man
give
to
an
object
in
which
he
have
suddenly
begin
to
be
interested
.
<EOS>
Dinah
,
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
,
feel
a
painful
self
-
consciousness
;
there
be
something
in
the
dark
penetrating
glance
of
this
strong
man
so
different
from
the
mildness
and
timidity
of
his
brother
Seth
.
<EOS>
a
faint
blush
come
,
which
deepen
as
she
wonder
at
it
.
<EOS>
this
blush
recall
Adam
from
his
forgetfulness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
take
by
surprise
;
it
be
very
good
of
you
to
come
and
see
my
mother
in
her
trouble
,
"
he
say
,
in
a
gentle
grateful
tone
,
for
his
quick
mind
tell
him
at
once
how
she
come
to
be
there
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
my
mother
be
thankful
to
have
you
,
"
he
add
,
wonder
rather
anxiously
what
have
be
Dinah
's
reception
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Dinah
,
resume
her
work
,
"
she
seem
greatly
comfort
after
a
while
,
and
she
be
have
a
good
deal
of
rest
in
the
night
,
by
time
.
<EOS>
She
be
fast
asleep
when
I
leave
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
it
take
the
news
to
the
Hall
Farm
?
"
say
Adam
,
his
thought
revert
to
some
one
there
;
he
wonder
whether
she
have
feel
anything
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
Mr.
Irwine
,
the
clergyman
,
tell
me
,
and
my
aunt
be
grieve
for
your
mother
when
she
hear
it
,
and
want
me
to
come
;
and
so
be
my
uncle
,
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
now
he
be
hear
it
,
but
he
be
go
out
to
rosseter
all
yesterday
.
<EOS>
They
will
look
for
you
there
as
soon
as
you
have
get
time
to
go
,
for
there
be
nobody
round
<EOS>
that
hearth
<EOS>
but
what
be
glad
to
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
,
with
her
sympathetic
divination
,
know
quite
well
that
Adam
be
long
to
hear
if
Hetty
have
say
anything
about
their
trouble
;
she
be
too
rigorously
truthful
for
benevolent
invention
,
but
she
have
contrive
to
say
something
in
which
Hetty
be
tacitly
include
.
<EOS>
love
have
a
way
of
cheat
itself
consciously
,
like
a
child
who
play
at
solitary
hide
-
and
-
seek
;
it
be
pleased
with
assurance
that
it
all
the
while
disbelief
.
<EOS>
Adam
like
what
Dinah
have
say
so
much
that
his
mind
be
directly
full
of
the
next
visit
he
should
pay
to
the
Hall
Farm
,
when
Hetty
would
perhaps
behave
more
kindly
to
him
than
she
have
ever
do
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
not
be
there
yourself
any
longer
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
to
Dinah
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
go
back
to
Snowfield
on
Saturday
,
and
I
shall
have
to
set
out
to
Treddleston
early
,
to
be
in
time
for
the
oakbourne
carrier
.
<EOS>
so
I
must
go
back
to
the
farm
to
-
night
,
that
I
may
have
the
last
day
with
my
aunt
and
her
child
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
stay
here
all
to
-
day
,
if
your
mother
would
like
me
;
and
her
heart
seem
inclined
towards
me
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
then
,
she
be
sure
to
want
you
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
if
mother
take
to
people
at
the
beginning
,
she
be
sure
to
get
fond
of
'em
;
but
she
be
a
strange
way
of
not
like
young
woman
.
<EOS>
though
,
to
be
sure
,
"
Adam
go
on
,
smile
,
"
her
not
like
other
young
woman
be
no
reason
why
she
should
not
like
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
Gyp
have
be
assist
at
this
conversation
in
motionless
silence
,
seat
on
his
haunch
,
and
alternately
look
up
in
his
master
's
face
to
watch
its
expression
and
observe
Dinah
's
movement
about
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
the
kind
smile
with
which
Adam
utter
the
last
word
be
apparently
decisive
with
Gyp
of
the
light
in
which
the
stranger
be
to
be
regard
,
and
as
she
turn
round
after
put
aside
her
sweeping
-
brush
,
he
trot
towards
her
and
put
up
his
muzzle
against
her
hand
in
a
friendly
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
Gyp
bid
you
welcome
,
"
say
Adam
,
"
and
he
be
very
slow
to
welcome
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
poor
dog
!
<EOS>
"
say
Dinah
,
pat
the
rough
grey
coat
,
"
I
have
a
strange
feeling
about
the
dumb
thing
as
if
they
want
to
speak
,
and
it
be
a
trouble
to
'em
because
they
could
not
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
be
sorry
for
the
dog
always
,
though
perhaps
there
be
no
need
.
<EOS>
but
they
may
well
have
more
in
them
than
they
know
how
to
make
us
understand
,
for
we
can
not
say
half
what
we
feel
,
with
all
our
word
.
"
  
<EOS>
Seth
come
down
now
,
and
be
pleased
to
find
Adam
talk
with
Dinah
;
he
want
Adam
to
know
how
much
well
she
be
than
all
other
woman
.
<EOS>
but
after
a
few
word
of
greeting
,
Adam
draw
him
into
the
workshop
to
consult
about
the
coffin
,
and
Dinah
go
on
with
her
cleaning
.
  
<EOS>
by
six
o'clock
they
be
all
at
breakfast
with
Lisbeth
in
a
kitchen
as
clean
as
she
could
have
make
it
herself
.
<EOS>
the
window
and
door
be
open
,
and
the
morning
air
bring
with
it
a
mingled
scent
of
southernwood
,
thyme
,
and
sweet
-
briar
from
the
patch
of
garden
by
the
side
of
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
Dinah
do
not
sit
down
at
first
,
but
move
about
,
serve
the
other
with
the
warm
porridge
and
the
toast
oat
-
cake
,
which
she
have
get
ready
in
the
usual
way
,
for
she
have
ask
Seth
to
tell
her
just
what
his
mother
give
them
for
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Lisbeth
have
be
unusually
silent
since
she
come
downstairs
,
apparently
require
some
time
to
adjust
her
idea
to
a
state
of

Bartle

nevertheless
Arthur

himself
very
heroic
as
he

towards
the

give
his
order
about
the

<EOS>
His

it

an
approbation
to
be
enjoy
quite
gratuitously

it

win
by

merit

<EOS>
He
have
never

forfeit
that

and
he
have
considerable
reliance
on

<EOS>
no

could
confess

candidly

of

how
can
a

's
candour
be
see
in
all
its
lustre
unless
he
have
a
few
failing
to
talk
of
?
<EOS>
but
he
have
an
agreeable
confidence
that
his

be
all
of
a
generous
kind
 
impetuous
,
warm

leonine

never

<EOS>
It
be
not

for
Arthur
Donnithorne
to
do
anything
mean

dastardly
,
or
cruel
.
"
<EOS>
no

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
"
unhappily
,
there
be
no
inherent
poetical
justice
in
hobble

and
they
will
sometimes
obstinately
refuse
to
inflict
their
bad
consequence
on
the
prime
offender
,
in
spite
of
his

<EOS>
It
be
entirely
owing
to
this
deficiency
in
the

of

that
Arthur
have
ever
bring
any

He

and
one
of
the

he
would
perform
in
that

should
be
to
increase

His

You
perceive
that
Arthur
Donnithorne
be
"
a
good

"
 
all
his
college
friend
think
him
such
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
to

he

in

he
be

twenty

you
remember

who
this
morning
prove
himself
capable
of
a

resolution
found
on

<EOS>
one
thing
be
clear
:
nature
have
take
care
that
he
shall
never
go
far
astray
with
perfect
comfort
and
satisfaction
to
himself
;
he
will
never

border
-
land
of
sin
,
where
he
will
be
perpetually
harass
by
assault
from
the
other
side
of
the
boundary
.
<EOS>
He
will
never

<EOS>
It
be
about
ten
o'clock

and
the
sun

brilliantly
;
everything
be
look
lovely
for
the
yesterday

<EOS>
It
be
a
pleasant
thing
on
such
a
morning
to
walk
along
the
well
-
roll
gravel
on
one
's
way
to
the
stable
,
meditate
an
excursion
.
<EOS>
but
the
scent
of
the
stable
,
which
,
in
a
natural
state
of
thing
,
ought
to
be
among
the
soothe
influence
of
a
man
's
life

always
bring
with
it
some
irritation
to
Arthur

<EOS>
there
be
no
have
his
own
way
in
the
stable
;
everything
be
manage
in
the
stingy
fashion
.
<EOS>
His
grandfather
persist
in
retain
as
head
groom
an
old
dolt
whom
no
sort
of
lever
could
move
out
of
his
old
habit
,
and
who
be
allow
to
hire
a
succession
of
raw
Loamshire
lad
as
his
subordinate
,
one
of
whom
have
lately
test
a
new
pair
of
shear
by
clip
an
oblong
patch
on
Arthur
's
bay
mare
.
<EOS>
this
state
of
thing
be
naturally
embitter
;
one
can
put
up
with
annoyance
in
the
house
,
but
to
have
the
stable
make
a
scene
of
vexation
and
disgust
be
a
point
beyond
what
human
flesh
and
blood
can
be
expect
to
endure
long
together
without
danger
of
misanthropy

Old

first
object
that
meet
Arthur

enter

yard

and
it
quite
poison
for
him

bark
of

He
could
never

while

that

if
he

and
that
Arthur

presently
repasse
the

without

<EOS>
He
consider
himself
thoroughly

annoyed

<EOS>
there
be
not
another
mount
in
the
stable
for
himself
and
his
servant
besides
Meg
and
Rattler
.
<EOS>
It
be
vexatious
;
just
when
he
want
to
get
out
of
the
way
for
a
week
or
two
.
<EOS>
It
seem
culpable
in
Providence
to
allow
such
a
combination
of
circumstance
.
<EOS>
to
be
shut
up
at
the
Chase
with
a
broken
arm
when
every
other
fellow
in
his

be
enjoy
himself
at
Windsor
 
shut
up
with
his
grandfather
,
who
have
the
same
sort
of
affection
for
him
as
for
his
parchment
deed

<EOS>
and
to
be
disgust
at
every
turn
with
the
management
of

the

<EOS>
in
such
circumstance
a
man
necessarily
get
in
an
ill
humour

and
work
off
the
irritation
by
some
excess
or
other

<EOS>
"
Salkeld
would
have

he
mutter
to

,
"
but
I
be
not
well
season
enough
for
that

<EOS>
well
,
since
I
can
not
go
to
Eagledale
,
I
will
have
a
gallop
on
Rattler
to
Norburne
this
morning
,
and
lunch
with
Gawaine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
behind
this
explicit
resolution
there
lie
an
implicit
one
.
<EOS>
if
he
lunch
with
Gawaine
and
linger
chat
,
he
should
not
reach
the
Chase
again
till
nearly
five
,
when
Hetty
would
be
safe
out
of
his
sight
in
the
housekeeper
's
room
;
and
when
she
set
out
to
go
home
,
it
would
be
his
lazy
time
after
dinner
,
so
he
should
keep
out
of
her
way
altogether
.
<EOS>
there
really
would
have
be
no
harm
in
be
kind
to
the
little
thing
,
and
it
be
worth
dance
with
a
dozen
ballroom
belle
only
to
look
at
Hetty
for
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
he
have
well
not
take
any
more
notice
of
her
;
it
may
put
notion
into
her
head
,
as
Irwine
have
hint
;
though
Arthur
,
for
his
part
,
think
girl
be
not
by
any
mean
so
soft
and
easily
bruise
;
indeed
,
he
have
generally
find
them
twice
as
cool
and
cunning
as
he
be
himself
.
<EOS>
as
for
any
real
harm
in
Hetty
's
case
,
it
be
out
of
the
question
:
Arthur
Donnithorne
accept
his
own
bond
for
himself
with
perfect
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
so
the
twelve
o'clock
sun
see
him
gallop
towards
Norburne
;
and
by
good
fortune
Halsell
Common
lie
in
his
road
and
give
him
some
fine
leap
for
Rattler
.
<EOS>
nothing
like
"
take
"
a
few
bush
and
ditch
for
exorcise
a
demon
;
and
it
be
really
astonishing
that
the
Centaurs
,
with
their
immense
advantage
in
this
way
,
have
leave
so
bad
a
reputation
in
history
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
,
you
will
perhaps
be
surprised
to
hear
that
although
Gawaine
be
at
home
,
the
hand
of
the
dial
in
the
courtyard
have
scarcely
clear
the
last
stroke
of
three
when
Arthur
return
through
the
entrance
-
gate
,
get
down
from
the
pant
Rattler
,
and
go
into
the
house
to
take
a
hasty
luncheon
.
<EOS>
but
I
believe
there
have
be
man
since
his
day
who
have
ride
a
long
way
to
avoid
a
rencontre
,
and
then
gallop
hastily
back
lest
they
should
miss
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
favourite
stratagem
of
our
passion
to
sham
a
retreat
,
and
to
turn
sharp
round
upon
us
at
the
moment
we
have
make
up
our
mind
that
the
day
be
our
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
cap'n

ridin

the
devil

pace

"
say
Dalton
the
coachman
,
whose
person
stand
out
in
high
relief
as
he
smoke
his
pipe
against
the
stable
wall
,
when
John
bring
up
Rattler
.
  
<EOS>
"
an
'
I
wish
he
would
get
the
devil
to
do
's
groom
for'n

"
growl
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
aye
;
he
would
hev
a
deal
haimabler
groom
nor
what
he
have
now
<EOS>
,
"
observe
Dalton
 
and
the
joke
appear
to
him
so
good
that
,
be
leave
alone
upon
the
scene
<EOS>
,
he
continue
at
interval
to
take
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
in
order
to
wink
at
an
imaginary
audience
and
shake
luxuriously
with
a
silent
,
ventral
laughter
,
mentally
rehearse
the
dialogue
from
the
beginning
,
that
he
may
recite
it
with
effect
in
the
servant
'
hall
.
  
<EOS>
when
Arthur
go
up
to
his
dressing
-
room
again
after
luncheon
,
it
be
inevitable
that
the
debate
he
have
have
with
himself
there
earlier
in
the
day
should
flash
across
his
mind
;
but
it
be
impossible
for
him
now
to
dwell
on
the
remembrance
 
impossible
to
recall
the
feeling
and
reflection
which
have
be
decisive
with
him
then
,
any
more
than
to
recall
the
peculiar
scent
of
the
air
that
have
freshen
him
when
he
first
open
his
window
.
<EOS>
the
desire
to
see
Hetty
have
rush
back
like
an
ill
-
stem
current
;
he
be
amazed
himself
at
the
force
with
which
this
trivial
fancy
seem
to
grasp
him
<EOS>
:
he
be
even
rather
tremulous
as
he
brush
his
hair
 
pooh
!
<EOS>
it
be
ride
in
that
break
-
neck
way
.
<EOS>
It
be
because
he
have
make
a
serious
affair
of
an
idle
matter
,
by
think
of
it
as
if
it
be
of
any
consequence
.
<EOS>
He
would
amuse
himself
by
see
Hetty
to
-
day
,
and
get
rid
of
the
whole
thing
from
his
mind
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
Irwine
's
fault
.
<EOS>
"
if
Irwine
have
say
nothing
,
I
should
not
have
think
half
so
much
of
Hetty
as

<EOS>
however
,
it
be
just
the
sort
of
day
for
lolling
in
the
Hermitage
,
and
he
would
go
and
finish
Dr.
Moore
's
Zeluco
there
before
dinner

<EOS>
the

tree
Grove
 
<EOS>
the
way
Hetty
be
sure
to
come
in
walk
from
the
Hall
Farm
.
<EOS>
so
nothing
could
be
simple
and
more
natural
:
meet
Hetty
be
a
mere
circumstance
of
his
walk
,
not
its
object

<EOS>
Arthur
's
shadow
flit
rather
faster
among
the
sturdy
oak
of
the
Chase
than
may
have
be
expect
from
the
shadow
of
a
tired
man
on
a
warm
afternoon
,
and
it
be
still
scarcely
four
o'clock
when
he
stand
before
the
tall
narrow
gate
lead
into
the
delicious
labyrinthine
wood
which
skirt
one
side
of
the
Chase
,
and
which
be
call
fir
-
tree
Grove
,
not
because
the
fir
be
many
,
but
because
they
be
few
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
wood
of
beech
and
lime
,
with
here
<EOS>
and
there
a
light
silver
-
stem
birch
 
<EOS>
just
the
sort
of
wood
most
haunt
by
the
nymph
<EOS>
:
you
see
their
white
sunlit
limb
gleam
athwart
the
bough
,
or
peep
from
behind
the
smooth
-
sweeping
outline
of
a
tall
lime
;
you
hear
their
soft
liquid
laughter
 
<EOS>
but
if
you
look
with
a
too
curious
sacrilegious
eye
,
they
vanish
behind
the
silvery
beech
<EOS>
,
they
make
you
believe
that
their
voice
be
only
a
running
brooklet
,
perhaps
they
metamorphose
themselves
into
a
tawny
squirrel
that
scamper
away
and
mock
you
from
the
topmost
bough
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
grove
with
measured
grass
or
roll
gravel
for
you
to
tread
upon
,
but
with
narrow
,
hollow
-
shaped
,
earthy
path
,
edge
with
faint
dash
of
delicate
moss
 
path
which
look
as
if
they
be
make
by
the
free
will
of
the
tree
and
underwood
,
move
reverently
aside
to
look
at
the
tall
queen
of
the
white
-
footed
nymph
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
along
the
broad
of
these
path
that
Arthur
Donnithorne
pass
,
under
an
avenue
of
lime
and
beech
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
still
afternoon
 
<EOS>
the
golden
light
be
linger
languidly
among
the
upper
bough
,
only
glance
down
here
<EOS>
and
there
on
the
purple
pathway
and
its
edge
of
faintly
sprinkle
moss
:
an
afternoon
in
which
destiny
disguise
her
cold
awful
face
behind
a
hazy
radiant
veil
,
enclose
us
in
warm
downy
wing
,
and
poison
us
with
violet
-
scent
breath
.
<EOS>
Arthur
stroll
along
carelessly
,
with
a
book
under
his
arm
,
but
not
look
on
the
ground
as
meditative
man
be
apt
to
do
;
his
eye
WOULD
fix
themselves
on
the
distant
bend
in
the
road
round
which
a
little
figure
must
surely
appear
before
long
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
there
she
come
.
<EOS>
first
a
bright
patch
of
colour
,
like
a
tropic
bird
among
the
bough
;
then
a
tripping
figure
,
with
a
round
hat
on
,
and
a
small
basket
under
her
arm
;
then
a
deep
-
blush
,
almost
frighten
,
but
bright
-
smile
girl
,
make
her
curtsy
with
a
fluttered
yet
happy
glance
,
as
Arthur
come
up
to
her
.
<EOS>
if
Arthur
have
have
time
to
think
at
all
,
he
would
have
think
it
strange
that
he
should
feel
fluttered
too
,
be
conscious
of
blush
too
 
in
fact
,
look
and
feel
as
foolish
as
if
he
have
be
take
by
surprise
instead
of
meet
just
what
he
expect
.
<EOS>
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
they
be
not
in
that
golden
age
of
childhood
when
they
would
have
stand
face
to
face
,
eye
each
other
with
timid
liking
,
then
give
each
other
a
little
butterfly
kiss
,
and
toddle
off
to
play
together
.
<EOS>
Arthur
would
have
go
home
to
his
silk
-
curtain
cot
,
and
Hetty
to
her
home
-
spin
pillow
,
and
both
would
have
sleep
without
dream
,
and
to
-
morrow
would
have
be
a
life
hardly
conscious
of
a
yesterday
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
turn
round
and
walk
by
Hetty
's
side
without
give
a
reason
.
<EOS>
They
be
alone
together
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
what
an
overpower
presence
that
first
privacy
be
!
<EOS>
He
actually
dare
not
look
at
this
little
butter
-
maker
for
the
first
minute
or
two
.
<EOS>
as
for
Hetty
,
her
foot
rest
on
a
cloud
,
and
she
be
bear
along
by
warm
zephyrs
;
she
have
forget
her
rise
-
colour
ribbon
;
she
be
no
more
conscious
of
her
limb
than
if
her
childish
soul
have
pass
into
a
water
-
lily
,
rest
on
a
liquid
bed
and
warm
by
the
midsummer
sun
-
beam
.
<EOS>
It
may
seem
a
contradiction
,
but
Arthur
gather
a
certain
carelessness
and
confidence
from
his
timidity
:
it
be
an
entirely
different
state
of
mind
from
what
he
have
expect
in
such
a
meeting
with
Hetty
;
and
full
as
he
be
of
vague
feeling
,
there
be
room
,
in
those
moment
of
silence
,
for
the
thought
that
his
previous
debate
and
scruple
be
needless
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
quite
right
to
choose
this
way
of
come
to
the
Chase
,
"
he
say
at
last
,
look
down
at
Hetty
;
"
it
be
so
much
pretty
as
well
as
short
than
come
by
either
of
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
"
Hetty
answer
,
with
a
tremulous
,
almost
whisper
voice
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
know
one
bit
how
to
speak
to
a
gentleman
like
Mr.
Arthur
,
and
her
very
vanity
make
her
more
coy
of
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
come
every
week
to
see
Mrs.
Pomfret
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
every
Thursday
,
only
when
she
be
get
to
go
out
with
Miss
Donnithorne
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
she
be
teach
you
something
,
be
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
the
lace
-
mending
as
she
learn
abroad
,
and
the
stocking
-
mending
 
<EOS>
it
look
just
like
the
stocking
,
you
can
not
tell
it
be
be
mend
;
and
she
teach
me
cutting
-
out
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
be
you
go
to
be
a
lady
's
maid
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
be
one
very
much
indeed
.
"
<EOS>
Hetty
speak
more
audibly
now
,
but
still
rather
tremulously
;
she
think
,
perhaps
she
seem
as
stupid
to
Captain
Donnithorne
as
Luke
Britton
do
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
Mrs.
Pomfret
always
expect
you
at
this
time
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
expect
me
at
four
o'clock
.
<EOS>
I
be
rather
late
to
-
day
,
because
my
aunt
could
not
spare
me
;
but
the
regular
time
be
four
,
because
that
give
us
time
before
Miss
Donnithorne
's
bell
ring
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
then
,
I
must
not
keep
you
now
,
else
I
should
like
to
show
you
the
hermitage
.
<EOS>
do
you
ever
see
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
walk
where
we
turn
up
to
it
.
<EOS>
but
we
must
not
go
now
.
<EOS>
I
will
show
it
you
some
other
time
,
if
you
would
like
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
please
,
sir
.
"
  
"
do
you
always
come
back
this
way
in
the
evening
,
or
be
you
afraid
to
come
so
lonely
a
road
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
no
,
sir
,
it
be
never
late
;
I
always
set
out
by
eight
o'clock
,
and
it
be
so
light
now
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
would
be
angry
with
me
if
I
do
not
get
home
before
nine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
Craig
,
the
gardener
,
come
to
take
care
of
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
a
deep
blush
overspread
Hetty
's
face
and
neck
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
he
do
not
;
I
be
sure
he
never
do
;
I
would
not
let
him
;
I
do
not
like
him
,
"
she
say
hastily
,
and
the
tear
of
vexation
have
come
so
fast
that
before
she
have
do
speak
a
bright
drop
roll
down
her
hot
cheek
.
<EOS>
then
she
feel
ashamed
to
death
that
she
be
cry
,
and
for
one
long
instant
her
happiness
be
all
go
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
next
she
feel
an
arm
steal
round
her
,
and
a
gentle
voice
say
,
"
why
,
Hetty
,
what
make
you
cry
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
vex
you
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
vex
you
for
the
world
,
you
little
blossom
.
<EOS>
come
,
do
not
cry
<EOS>
;
look
at
me
,
else
I
shall
think
you
will
not
forgive
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
have
lay
his
hand
on
the
soft
arm
that
be
near
to
him
,
and
be
stoop
towards
Hetty
with
a
look
of
coax
entreaty
.
<EOS>
Hetty
lift
her
long
dewy
lash
,
and
meet
the
eye
that
be
bent
towards
her
with
a
sweet
,
timid
,
beseech
look
.
<EOS>
what
a
space
of
time
those
three
moment
be
while
their
eye
meet
and
his
arm
touch
her
!
<EOS>
love
be
such
a
simple
thing
when
we
have
only
one
-
and
-
twenty
summer
and
a
sweet
girl
of
seventeen
tremble
under
our
glance
,
as
if
she
be
a
bud
first
open
her
heart
with
wonder
rapture
to
the
morning
.
<EOS>
such
young
unfurrowed
soul
roll
to
meet
each
other
like
two
velvet
peach
that
touch
softly
and
be
at
rest
;
they
mingle
as
easily
as
two
brooklet
that
ask
for
nothing
but
to
entwine
themselves
and
ripple
with
ever
-
interlace
curve
in
the
leafy
hiding
-
place
.
<EOS>
while
Arthur
gaze
into
Hetty
's
dark
beseech
eye
,
it
make
no
difference
to
him
what
sort
of
English
she
speak
;
and
even
if
hoop
and
powder
have
be
in
fashion
,
he
would
very
likely
not
have
be
sensible
just
then
that
Hetty
want
those
sign
of
high
breeding
.
  
<EOS>
but
they
start
asunder
with
beat
heart
:
something
have
fall
on
the
ground
with
a
rattle
noise
;
it
be
Hetty
's
basket
;
all
her
little
workwoman
's
matter
be
scatter
on
the
path
,
some
of
them
show
a
capability
of
roll
to
great
length
.
<EOS>
there
be
much
to
be
do
in
pick
up
,
and
not
a
word
be
speak
;
but
when
Arthur
hang
the
basket
over
her
arm
again
,
the
poor
child
feel
a
strange
difference
in
his
look
and
manner
.
<EOS>
He
just
press
her
hand
,
and
say
,
with
a
look
and
tone
that
be
almost
chilling
to
her
,
"
I
have
be
hinder
you
;
I
must
not
keep
you
any
longer
now
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
expect
at
the
house
.
<EOS>
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
without
wait
for
her
to
speak
,
he
turn
away
from
her
and
hurry
back
towards
the
road
that
lead
to
the
Hermitage
,
leave
Hetty
to
pursue
her
way
in
a
strange
dream
that
seem
to
have
begin
in
bewilder
delight
and
be
now
pass
into
contrariety
and
sadness
.
<EOS>
Would
he
meet
her
again
as
she
come
home
?
<EOS>
why
have
he
speak
almost
as
if
he
be
displeased
with
her
?
<EOS>
and
then
run
away
so
suddenly
?
<EOS>
She
cry
,
hardly
know
why
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
too
be
very
uneasy
,
but
his
feeling
be
light
up
for
him
by
a
more
distinct
consciousness
.
<EOS>
He
hurry
to
the
Hermitage
,
which
stand
in
the
heart
of
the
wood
,
unlock
the
door
with
a
hasty
wrench
,
slam
it
after
him
,
pitch
Zeluco
into
the
most
distant
corner
,
and
thrust
his
right
hand
into
his
pocket
,
first
walk
four
or
five
time
up
and
down
the
scanty
length
of
the
little
room
,
and
then
seat
himself
on
the
ottoman
in
an
uncomfortable
stiff
way
,
as
we
often
do
when
we
wish
not
to
abandon
ourselves
to
feel
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
get
in
love
with
Hetty
 
<EOS>
that
be
quite
plain
.
<EOS>
He
be
ready
to
pitch
everything
else
 
<EOS>
no
matter
where
 
for
the
sake
of
surrender
himself
to
this
delicious
feeling
which
have
just
disclose
itself
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
use
blink
the
fact
now
 
they
would
get
too
fond
of
each
other
,
if
he
go
on
take
notice
of
her
 
and
what
would
come
of
it
?
<EOS>
He
should
have
to
go
away
in
a
few
week
,
and
the
poor
little
thing
would
be
miserable
.
<EOS>
He
MUST
not
see
her
alone
again
;
he
must
keep
out
of
her
way
.
<EOS>
what
a
fool
he
be
for
come
back
from
Gawaine
's
!
  
<EOS>
He
get
up
and
throw
open
the
window
,
to
let
in
the
soft
breath
of
the
afternoon
,
and
the
healthy
scent
of
the
fir
that
make
a
belt
round
the
Hermitage
.
<EOS>
the
soft
air
do
not
help
his
resolution
,
as
he
lean
out
and
look
into
the
leafy
distance
.
<EOS>
but
he
consider
his
resolution
sufficiently
fix
:
there
be
no
need
to
debate
with
himself
any
longer
.
<EOS>
He
have
make
up
his
mind
not
to
meet
Hetty
again
;
and
now
he
may
give
himself
up
to
think
how
immensely
agreeable
it
would
be
if
circumstance
be
different
 
<EOS>
how
pleasant
it
would
have
be
to
meet
her
this
evening
as
she
come
back
,
and
put
his
arm
round
her
again
and
look
into
her
sweet
face
.
<EOS>
He
wonder
if
the
dear
little
thing
be
think
of
him
too
 
twenty
to
one
she
be
.
<EOS>
how
beautiful
her
eye
be
with
the
tear
on
their
lash
!
<EOS>
He
would
like
to
satisfy
his
soul
for
a
day
with
look
at
them
,
and
he
MUST
see
her
again
 
<EOS>
he
must
see
her
,
simply
to
remove
any
false
impression
from
her
mind
about
his
manner
to
her
just
now
.
<EOS>
He
would
behave
in
a
quiet
,
kind
way
to
her
 
just
to
prevent
her
from
go
home
with
her
head
full
of
wrong
fancy
.
<EOS>
yes
,
that
would
be
the
good
thing
to
do
after
all
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
while
 
more
than
an
hour
before
Arthur
have
bring
his
meditation
to
this
point
;
but
once
arrive
there
,
he
could
stay
no
longer
at
the
Hermitage
.
<EOS>
the
time
must
be
fill
up
with
movement
until
he
should
see
Hetty
again
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
already
late
enough
to
go
and
dress
for
dinner

for
his
grandfather
's
dinner
-
hour
be
six
.
    
<EOS>
Evening
in
the
Wood
  
<EOS>
it
happen
that
Mrs.
Pomfret
have
have
a
slight
quarrel
with
Mrs.
Best
,
the
housekeeper
,
on
this
Thursday
morning
 
a
fact
which
have
two
consequence
highly
convenient
to
Hetty
.
<EOS>
It
cause
Mrs.
Pomfret
to
have
tea
send
up
to
her
own
room
,
and
it
inspire
that
exemplary
lady
's
maid
with
so
lively
a
recollection
of
former
passage
in
Mrs.
Best
's
conduct
,
and
of
dialogue
in
which
Mrs.
Best
have
decidedly
the
inferiority
as
an
interlocutor
with
Mrs.
Pomfret
,
that
Hetty
require
no
more
presence
of
mind
than
be
demand
for
use
her
needle
,
and
throw
in
an
occasional
"
yes
"
or
"
no
.
<EOS>
"
She
would
have
want
to
put
on
her
hat
earlier
than
usual
;
only
she
have
tell
Captain
Donnithorne
that
she
usually
set
out
about
eight
o'clock
,
and
if
he
SHOULD
go
to
the
Grove
again
expect
to
see
her
,
and
she
should
be
go
!
<EOS>
Would
he
come
?
<EOS>
Her
little
butterfly
soul
flutter
incessantly
between
memory
and
dubious
expectation
.
<EOS>
at
last
the
minute
-
hand
of
the
old
-
fashioned
brazen
-
face
timepiece
be
on
the
last
quarter
to
eight
,
and
there
be
every
reason
for
its
be
time
to
get
ready
for
departure
.
<EOS>
even
Mrs.
Pomfret
's
preoccupied
mind
do
not
prevent
her
from
notice
what
look
like
a
new
flush
of
beauty
in
the
little
thing
as
she
tie
on
her
hat
before
the
looking
-
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
child
get
pretty
and
pretty
every
day
<EOS>
,
I
do
believe
,
"
be
her
inward
comment
.
<EOS>
"
the
more
be
the
pity
.
<EOS>
She
will
get
neither
a
place
nor
a
husband
any
the
sooner
for
it
.
<EOS>
sober
well
-
to
-
do
man
do
not
like
such
pretty
wife
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
a
girl
,
I
be
more
admired
than
if
I
have
be
so
very
pretty
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
be
reason
to
be
grateful
to
me
for
teach
her
something
to
get
her
bread
with
,
well
than
farm
-
house
work
.
<EOS>
They
always
tell
me
I
be
good
-
natured
 
<EOS>
and
that
be
the
truth
,
and
to
my
hurt
too
,
else
there
be
them
in
this
house
that
would
not
be
here
now
to
lord
it
over
me
in
the
housekeeper
's
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
walk
hastily
across
the
short
space
of
pleasure
-
ground
which
she
have
to
traverse
,
dread
to
meet
Mr.
Craig
,
to
whom
she
could
hardly
have
speak
civilly
.
<EOS>
how
relieved
she
be
when
she
have
get
safely
under
the
oak
and
among
the
fern
of
the
Chase
!
<EOS>
even
then
she
be
as
ready
to
be
startle
as
the
deer
that
leap
away
at
her
approach
.
<EOS>
She
think
nothing
of
the
evening
light
that
lie
gently
in
the
grassy
alley
between
the
fern
,
and
make
the
beauty
of
their
live
green
more
visible
than
it
have
be
in
the
overpowering
flood
of
noon
:
she
think
of
nothing
that
be
present
.
<EOS>
She
only
see
something
that
be
possible
:
Mr.
Arthur
Donnithorne
come
to
meet
her
again
along
the
fir
-
tree
Grove
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
foreground
of
Hetty
's
picture
;
behind
it
lie
a
bright
hazy
something
 
<EOS>
day
that
be
not
to
be
as
the
other
day
of
her
life
have
be
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
she
have
be
woo
by
a
river
-
god
,
who
may
any
time
take
her
to
his
wondrous
hall
below
a
watery
heaven
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
knowing
what
would
come
,
since
this
strange
entrancing
delight
have
come
.
<EOS>
if
a
chest
full
of
lace
and
satin
and
jewel
have
be
send
her
from
some
unknown
source
,
how
could
she
but
have
think
that
her
whole
lot
be
go
to
change
,
and
that
to
-
morrow
some
still
more
bewildering
joy
would
befall
her
?
<EOS>
Hetty
have
never
read
a
novel
;
if
she
have
ever
see
one
,
I
think
the
word
would
have
be
too
hard
for
her
;
how
then
could
she
find
a
shape
for
her
expectation
?
<EOS>
They
be
as
formless
as
the
sweet
languid
odour
of
the
garden
at
the
Chase
,
which
have
float
past
her
as
she
walk
by
the
gate
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
at
another
gate
now
 
that
lead
into
fir
-
tree
Grove
.
<EOS>
She
enter
the
wood
,
where
it
be
already
twilight
,
and
at
every
step
she
take
,
the
fear
at
her
heart
become
cold
.
<EOS>
if
he
should
not
come
!
<EOS>
oh
,
how
dreary
it
be
 
the
thought
of
go
out
at
the
other
end
of
the
wood
,
into
the
unsheltered
road
,
without
have
see
him
.
<EOS>
She
reach
the
first
turning
towards
the
Hermitage
,
walk
slowly
 
<EOS>
he
be
not
there
.
<EOS>
She
hate
the
leveret
that
run
across
the
path
;
she
hate
everything
that
be
not
what
she
long
for
.
<EOS>
She
walk
on
,
happy
whenever
she
be
come
to
a
bend
in
the
road
,
for
perhaps
he
be
behind
it
.
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
She
be
begin
to
cry
<EOS>
:
her
heart
have
swell
so
,
the
tear
stand
in
her
eye
;
she
give
one
great
sob
,
while
the
corner
of
her
mouth
quiver
,
and
the
tear
roll
down
.
  
<EOS>
She
do
not
know
that
there
be
another
turning
to
the
Hermitage
,
that
she
be
close
against
it
,
and
that
Arthur
Donnithorne
be
only
a
few
yard
from
her
,
full
of
one
thought
,
and
a
thought
of
which
she
only
be
the
object
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
see
Hetty
again
:
that
be
the
longing
which
have
be
grow
through
the
last
three
hour
to
a
feverish
thirst
.
<EOS>
not
,
of
course
,
to
speak
in
the
caressing
way
into
which
he
have
unguardedly
fall
before
dinner
,
but
to
set
thing
right
with
her
by
a
kindness
which
would
have
the
air
of
friendly
civility
,
and
prevent
her
from
run
away
with
wrong
notion
about
their
mutual
relation
.
  
<EOS>
if
Hetty
have
know
he
be
there
,
she
would
not
have
cry
;
and
it
would
have
be
well
,
for
then
Arthur
would
perhaps
have
behave
as
wisely
as
he
have
intend
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
she
start
when
he
appear
at
the
end
of
the
side
-
alley
,
and
look
up
at
him
with
two
great
drop
roll
down
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
what
else
could
he
do
but
speak
to
her
in
a
soft
,
soothe
tone
,
as
if
she
be
a
bright
-
eyed
spaniel
with
a
thorn
in
her
foot
?
  
<EOS>
"
have
something
frighten
you
,
Hetty
?
<EOS>
have
you
see
anything
in
the
wood
?
<EOS>
do
not
be
frighten
 
<EOS>
I
will
take
care
of
you
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
be
blush
so
<EOS>
,
she
do
not
know
whether
she
be
happy
or
miserable
.
<EOS>
to
be
cry
again
 
what
do
gentleman
think
of
girl
who
cry
in
that
way
?
<EOS>
She
feel
unable
even
to
say
"
no
,
"
but
could
only
look
away
from
him
and
wipe
the
tear
from
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
not
before
a
great
drop
have
fall
on
her
rise
-
colour
string
 
<EOS>
she
know
that
quite
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
be
cheerful
again
.
<EOS>
smile
at
me
,
and
tell
me
what
be
the
matter
.
<EOS>
come
,
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
turn
her
head
towards
him
,
whisper
,
"
I
think
you
would
not
come
,
"
and
slowly
get
courage
to
lift
her
eye
to
him
.
<EOS>
that
look
be
too
much
:
he
must
have
have
eye
of
egyptian
granite
not
to
look
too
lovingly
in
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
little
frightened
bird
!
<EOS>
little
tearful
rise
!
<EOS>
silly
pet
!
<EOS>
You
will
not
cry
again
,
now
I
be
with
you
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
ah
,
he
do
not
know
in
the
least
what
he
be
say
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
what
he
mean
to
say
.
<EOS>
His
arm
be
steal
round
the
waist
again
;
it
be
tighten
its
clasp
;
he
be
bend
his
face
nearer
and
near
to
the
round
cheek
;
his
lip
be
meet
those
pout
child
-
lip
,
and
for
a
long
moment
time
have
vanish
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
a
shepherd
in
Arcadia
for
aught
<EOS>
he
know
,
he
may
be
the
first
youth
kiss
the
first
maiden
,
he
may
be
Eros
himself
,
sip
the
lip
of
Psyche
 
<EOS>
it
be
all
one
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
speaking
for
minute
after
.
<EOS>
They
walk
along
with
beat
heart
till
they
come
within
sight
of
the
gate
at
the
end
of
the
wood
.
<EOS>
then
they
look
at
each
other
,
not
quite
as
they
have
look
before
,
for
in
their
eye
there
be
the
memory
of
a
kiss
.
  
<EOS>
but
already
something
bitter
have
begin
to
mingle
itself
with
the
fountain
of
sweet
:
already
Arthur
be
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
He
take
his
arm
from
Hetty
's
waist
,
and
say
,
"
here
we
be
,
almost
at
the
end
of
the
Grove
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
late
it
be
,
"
he
add
,
pull
out
his
watch
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
twenty
minute
past
eight
 
<EOS>
but
my
watch
be
too
fast
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
would
better
not
go
any
further
now
.
<EOS>
trot
along
quickly
with
your
little
foot
,
and
get
home
safely
.
<EOS>
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
her
hand
,
and
look
at
her
half
-
sadly
,
half
with
a
constrained
smile
.
<EOS>
Hetty
's
eye
seem
to
beseech
him
not
to
go
away
yet
;
but
he
pat
her
cheek
and
say
"
good
-
bye
"
again
.
<EOS>
She
be
oblige
to
turn
away
from
him
and
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Arthur
,
he
rush
back
through
the
wood
,
as
if
he
want
to
put
a
wide
space
between
himself
and
Hetty
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
go
to
the
Hermitage
again
;
he
remember
how
he
have
debate
with
himself
there
before
dinner
,
and
it
have
all
come
to
nothing
 
bad
than
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
walk
right
on
into
the
Chase
,
glad
to
get
out
of
the
Grove
,
which
surely
be
haunt
by
his
evil
genius
.
<EOS>
those
beech
and
smooth
lime
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
enervate
in
the
very
sight
of
them
;
but
the
strong
knot
old
oak
have
no
bend
languor
in
them
 
<EOS>
the
sight
of
them
would
give
a
man
some
energy
.
<EOS>
Arthur
lose
himself
among
the
narrow
opening
in
the
fern
,
wind
about
without
seek
any
issue
,
till
the
twilight
deepen
almost
to
night
under
the
great
bough
,
and
the
hare
look
black
as
it
dart
across
his
path
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
feel
much
more
strongly
than
he
have
do
in
the
morning
:
it
be
as
if
his
horse
have
wheel
round
from
a
leap
and
dare
to
dispute
his
mastery
.
<EOS>
He
be
dissatisfied
with
himself
,
irritate
,
mortify
.
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
fix
his
mind
on
the
probable
consequence
of
give
way
to
the
emotion
which
have
steal
over
him
to
-
day
 
of
continue
to
notice
Hetty
,
of
allow
himself
any
opportunity
for
such
slight
caress
as
he
have
be
betray
into
already
 
than
he
refuse
to
believe
such
a
future
possible
for
himself
.
<EOS>
to
flirt
with
Hetty
be
a
very
different
affair
from
flirt
with
a
pretty
girl
of
his
own
station
<EOS>
:
that
be
understand
to
be
an
amusement
on
both
side
,
or
,
if
it
become
serious
,
there
be
no
obstacle
to
marriage
.
<EOS>
but
this
little
thing
would
be
speak
ill
of
directly
,
if
she
happen
to
be
see
walk
with
him
;
and
then
those
excellent
people
,
the
Poysers
,
to
whom
a
good
name
be
as
precious
as
if
they
have
the
good
blood
in
the
land
in
their
vein
 
<EOS>
he
should
hate
himself
if
he
make
a
scandal
of
that
sort
,
on
the
estate
that
be
to
be
his
own
some
day
,
and
among
tenant
by
whom
he
like
,
above
all
,
to
be
respect
.
<EOS>
He
could
no
more
believe
that
he
should
so
fall
in
his
own
esteem
than
that
he
should
break
both
his
leg
and
go
on
crutch
all
the
rest
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
imagine
himself
in
that
position
;
it
be
too
odious
,
too
unlike
him
.
  
<EOS>
and
even
if
no
one
know
anything
about
it
,
they
may
get
too
fond
of
each
other
,
and
then
there
could
be
nothing
but
the
misery
of
parting
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
no
gentleman
,
out
of
a
ballad
,
could
marry
a
farmer
's
niece
.
<EOS>
there
must
be
an
end
to
the
whole
thing
at
once
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
foolish
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
he
have
be
so
determined
this
morning
,
before
he
go
to
Gawaine
's
;
and
while
he
be
there
something
have
take
hold
of
him
and
make
him
gallop
back
.
<EOS>
It
seem
he
could
not
quite
depend
on
his
own
resolution
,
as
he
have
think
he
could
;
he
almost
wish
his
arm
would
get
painful
again
,
and
then
he
should
think
of
nothing
but
the
comfort
it
would
be
to
get
rid
of
the
pain
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
know
what
impulse
may
seize
him
to
-
morrow
,
in
this
confound
place
,
where
there
be
nothing
to
occupy
him
imperiously
through
the
livelong
day
.
<EOS>
what
could
he
do
to
secure
himself
from
any
more
of
this
folly
?
  
<EOS>
there
be
but
one
resource
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
and
tell
Irwine
 
tell
him
everything
.
<EOS>
the
mere
act
of
tell
it
would
make
it
seem
trivial
;
the
temptation
would
vanish
,
as
the
charm
of
fond
word
vanishe
when
one
repeat
them
to
the
indifferent
.
<EOS>
in
every
way
it
would
help
him
to
tell
Irwine
.
<EOS>
He
would
ride
to
Broxton
Rectory
the
first
thing
after
breakfast
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
have
no
sooner
come
to
this
determination
than
he
begin
to
think
which
of
the
path
would
lead
him
home
,
and
make
as
short
a
walk
thither
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
He
feel
sure
he
should
sleep
now
:
he
have
have
enough
to
tire
him
,
and
there
be
no
more
need
for
him
to
think

<EOS>
to
the
feminine
mind
in
some
of
its
mood
,
all
thing
that
may
be
receive
a
temporary
charm
from
comparison
with
what
be
;
and
since
Adam
do
not
want
to
marry
Dinah
himself
,
Lisbeth
feel
rather
peevish
on
that
score
 
as
peevish
as
she
would
have
be
if
he
have
want
to
marry
her
,
and
so
shut
himself
out
from
Mary
Burge
and
the
partnership
as
effectually
as
by
marry
Hetty
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
more
than
half
-
past
eight
when
Adam
and
his
mother
be
talk
in
this
way
,
so
that
when
,
about
ten
minute
later
,
Hetty
reach
the
turning
of
the
lane
that
lead
to
the
farmyard
gate
,
she
see
Dinah
and
Seth
approach
it
from
the
opposite
direction
,
and
wait
for
them
to
come
up
to
her
.
<EOS>
They
,
too
,
like
Hetty
,
have
linger
a
little
in
their
walk
,
for
Dinah
be
try
to
speak
word
of
comfort
and
strength
to
Seth
in
these
part
moment

but
when
they
see
Hetty
,
they
pause
and
shake
hand

Seth
turn
homeward

Dinah
come
on
alone
.

"
Seth
Bede

have

speak
to

reach
Hetty

he
be
very
full
of
trouble
to

night

<EOS>
Hetty
answer
with
a
dimpled
smile
,
as
if
she
do
not
quite
know
what
have
be
say
;
and
it
make
a
strange
contrast
to
see
that
sparkle
self
-
engross
loveliness
look
at
by
Dinah
's
calm
pity
face
,
with
its
open
glance
which
tell
that
her
heart
live
in
no
cherished
secret
of
its
own
,
but
in
feeling
which
it
long
to
share
with
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
Hetty
like
Dinah
as
well
as
she
have
ever
like
any
woman
;
how
be
it
possible
to
feel
otherwise
towards
one
who
always
put
in
a
kind
word
for
her
when
her
aunt
be
find
fault
,
and
who
be
always
ready
to
take
Totty
off
her
hand
 
little
tiresome
Totty
,
that
be
make
such
a
pet
of
by
every
one
,
and
that
Hetty
could
see
no
interest
in
at
all
?
<EOS>
Dinah
have
never
say
anything
disapproving
or
reproachful
to
Hetty
during
her
whole
visit
to
the
Hall
Farm
;
she
have
talk
to
her
a
great
deal
in
a
serious
way
,
but
Hetty
do
not
mind
that
much
,
for
she
never
listen
:
whatever
Dinah
may
say
,
she
almost
always
stroke
Hetty
's
cheek
after
it
,
and
want
to
do
some
mending
for
her
.
<EOS>
Dinah
be
a
riddle
to
her
;
Hetty
look
at
her
much
in
the
same
way
as
one
may
imagine
a
little
perching
bird
that
could
only
flutter
from
bough
to
bough
,
to
look
at
the
swoop
of
the
swallow
or
the
mounting
of
the
lark
;
but
she
do
not
care
to
solve
such
riddle
,
any
more
than
she
care
to
know
what
be
mean
by
the
picture
in
the
Pilgrim
's
Progress
,
or
in
the
old
folio
Bible
that
Marty
and
Tommy
always
plague
her
about
on
a
Sunday
.
  
<EOS>
Dinah
take
her
hand
now
and
draw
it
under
her
own
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
look
very
happy
to
-
night
,
dear
child
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
think
of
you
often
when
I
be
at
Snowfield
,
and
see
your
face
before
me
as
it
be
now
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
strange
thing
 
sometimes
when
I
be
quite
alone
,
sit
in
my
room
with
my
eye
closed
,
or
walk
over
the
hill
,
the
people
I
have
see
and
know
,
if
it
be
only
be
for
a
few
day
,
be
bring
before
me
,
and
I
hear
their
voice
and
see
them
look
and
move
almost
plain
than
I
ever
do
when
they
be
really
with
me
so
as
I
could
touch
them
.
<EOS>
and
then
my
heart
be
draw
out
towards
them
,
and
I
feel
their
lot
as
if
it
be
my
own
,
and
I
take
comfort
in
spread
it
before
the
Lord
and
rest
in
His
love
,
on
their
behalf
as
well
as
my
own
.
<EOS>
and
so
I
feel
sure
you
will
come
before
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
pause
a
moment
,
but
Hetty
say
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
have
be
a
very
precious
time
to
me
,
"
Dinah
go
on
,
"
last
night
and
to
-
day
 
see
two
such
good
son
as
Adam
and
Seth
Bede
.
<EOS>
They
be
so
tender
and
thoughtful
for
their
aged
mother
.
<EOS>
and
she
have
be
tell
me
what
Adam
have
do
,
for
these
many
year
,
to
help
his
father
and
his
brother
;
it
be
wonderful
what
a
spirit
of
wisdom
and
knowledge
he
have
,
and
how
he
be
ready
to
use
it
all
in
behalf
of
them
that
be
feeble
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
sure
he
have
a
loving
spirit
too
.
<EOS>
I
have
notice
it
often
among
my
own
people
round
Snowfield
,
that
the
strong
,
skilful
man
be
often
the
gentle
to
the
woman
and
child
;
and
it
be
pretty
to
see
'em
carry
the
little
baby
as
if
they
be
no
heavy
than
little
bird
.
<EOS>
and
the
baby
always
seem
to
like
the
strong
arm
best
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
it
would
be
so
with
Adam
Bede
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
so
,
Hetty
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Hetty
abstractedly
,
for
her
mind
have
be
all
the
while
in
the
wood
,
and
she
would
have
find
it
difficult
to
say
what
she
be
assent
to
.
<EOS>
Dinah
see
she
be
not
incline
to
talk
,
but
there
would
not
have
be
time
to
say
much
more
,
for
they
be
now
at
the
yard
-
gate
.
  
<EOS>
the
still
twilight
,
with
its
die
western
red
and
its
few
faint
struggling
star
,
rest
on
the
farm
-
yard
,
where
there
be
not
a
sound
to
be
hear
but
the
stamping
of
the
cart
-
horse
in
the
stable
.
<EOS>
It
be
about
twenty
minute
after
sunset
.
<EOS>
the
fowl
be
all
go
to
roost
,
and
the
bull
-
dog
lie
stretch
on
the
straw
outside
his
kennel
,
with
the
black
-
and
-
tan
terrier
by
his
side
,
when
the
fall
-
to
of
the
gate
disturb
them
and
set
them
bark
,
like
good
official
,
before
they
have
any
distinct
knowledge
of
the
reason
.
  
<EOS>
the
barking
have
its
effect
in
the
house
,
for
,
as
Dinah
and
Hetty
approach
,
the
doorway
be
fill
by
a
portly
figure
,
with
a
ruddy
black
-
eyed
face
which
bear
in
it
the
possibility
of
look
extremely
acute
,
and
occasionally
contemptuous
,
on
market
-
day
,
but
have
now
a
predominant
after
-
supper
expression
of
hearty
good
-
nature
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
known
that
great
scholar
who
have
show
the
most
pitiless
acerbity
in
their
criticism
of
other
man
's
scholarship
have
yet
be
of
a
relenting
and
indulgent
temper
in
private
life
;
and
I
have
hear
of
a
learned
man
meekly
rock
the
twin
in
the
cradle
with
his
left
hand
,
while
with
his
right
he
inflict
the
most
lacerating
sarcasm
on
an
opponent
who
have
betray
a
brutal
ignorance
of
Hebrew
.
<EOS>
weakness
and
error
must
be
forgive
 
alas
!
<EOS>
they
be
not
alien
to
us
 
<EOS>
but
the
man
who
take
the
wrong
side
on
the
momentous
subject
of
the
hebrew
point
must
be
treat
as
the
enemy
of
his
race
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
same
sort
of
antithetic
mixture
in
Martin
Poyser
:
he
be
of
so
excellent
a
disposition
that
he
have
be
kind
and
more
respectful
than
ever
to
his
old
father
since
he
have
make
a
deed
of
gift
of
all
his
property
,
and
no
man
judge
his
neighbour
more
charitably
on
all
personal
matter
;
but
for
a
farmer
,
like
Luke
Britton
,
for
example
,
whose
fallow
be
not
well
clean
,
who
do
not
know
the
rudiment
of
hedge
and
ditch
,
and
show
but
a
small
share
of
judgment
in
the
purchase
of
winter
stock
,
Martin
Poyser
be
as
hard
and
implacable
as
the
north
-
east
wind
.
<EOS>
Luke
Britton
could
not
make
a
remark
,
even
on
the
weather
,
but
Martin
Poyser
detect
in
it
a
taint
of
that
unsoundness
and
general
ignorance
which
be
palpable
in
all
his
farming
operation
.
<EOS>
He
hate
to
see
the
fellow
lift
the
pewter
pint
to
his
mouth
in
the
bar
of
the
Royal
George
on
market
-
day
,
and
the
mere
sight
of
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
bring
a
severe
and
critical
expression
into
his
black
eye
,
as
different
as
possible
from
the
fatherly
glance
he
bend
on
his
two
niece
as
they
approach
the
door
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
have
smoke
his
evening
pipe
,
and
now
hold
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
as
the
only
resource
of
a
man
who
continue
to
sit
up
after
the

be
do

<EOS>
"
why

ye're

rather
late

well

she
could
see
a
reflection
of
herself
in
the
old

fashioned
looking

glass
,
quite
as
distinct
as

needful

consider
that

a
quarter
of
a

before

at
a

of
genteel
household
furniture

even

an

something

it

a

gilding
about

it
have
a
firm
mahogany
base

well
supply
with
drawer

send
the

leap
out

the

reach
them

above
all

it
have
a
brass
candle

socket
on

which
would
give

an
aristocratic
air
to

last

object
to
it
because
it
have
numerous
dim
blotch
sprinkle
over
the

which
no

remove

and
because
,
instead
of
swinge
backwards

forwards
,
it
be
fix
in
an
upright
position
,
so
that
she
could
only
get
one
good
view
of
her
head
and
neck
,

that
be

only
by

table
be
no
dressing
-
table
at
all
,
but
a
small
old
chest
of
drawer
,
the
most
awkward
thing
in
the
world
to
sit
down
before
,
for
<EOS>
the
big
brass
handle
quite
hurt
her
knee
,
and
she
could
not
get
near
the
glass
at
all
comfortably
.
<EOS>
but
devout
worshipper
never
allow
inconvenience
to
prevent
them
from
perform
their
religious
rite
,
and
Hetty
this
evening
be
more
bent
on
her
peculiar
form
of
worship
than
usual
.
  
<EOS>
have
take
off
her
gown
and
white
kerchief
,
she
draw
a
key
from
the
large
pocket
that
hang
outside
her
petticoat
,
and
,
unlock
one
of
the
low
drawer
in
the
chest
,
reach
from
it
two
short
bit
of
wax
candle
 
secretly
buy
at
Treddleston
 
and
stick
them
in
the
two
brass
socket
.
<EOS>
then
she
draw
forth
a
bundle
of
match
and
light
the
candle
;
and
last
of
all
,
a
small
red
-
frame
shill
look
-
glass
,
without
blotch
.
<EOS>
It
be
into
this
small
glass
that
she
choose
to
look
first
after
seat
herself
.
<EOS>
She
look
into
it
,
smile
and
turn
her
head
on
one
side
,
for
a
minute
,
then
lay
it
down
and
take
out
her
brush
and
comb
from
an
upper
drawer
.
<EOS>
She
be
go
to
let
down
her
hair
,
and
make
herself
look
like
that
picture
of
a
lady
in
Miss
Lydia
Donnithorne
's
dressing
-
room
.
<EOS>
It
be
soon
do
,
and
the
dark
hyacinthine
curve
fall
on
her
neck
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
heavy
,
massive
,
merely
ripple
hair
,
but
soft
and
silken
,
run
at
every
opportunity
into
delicate
ring
.
<EOS>
but
she
push
it
all
backward
to
look
like
the
picture
,
and
form
a
dark
curtain
,
throw
into
relief
her
round
white
neck
.
<EOS>
then
she
put
down
her
brush
and
comb
and
look
at
herself
,
fold
her
arm
before
her
,
still
like
the
picture
.
<EOS>
even
the
old
mottled
glass
could
not
help
send
back
a
lovely
image
,
none
the
less
lovely
because
Hetty
's
stay
be
not
of
white
satin
 
<EOS>
such
as
I
feel
sure
heroine
must
generally
wear
 
<EOS>
but
of
a
dark
greenish
cotton
texture
.
  
<EOS>
oh
yes
!
<EOS>
She
be
very
pretty
.
<EOS>
Captain
Donnithorne
think
so
.
<EOS>
pretty
than
anybody
about
Hayslope
 
pretty
than
any
of
the
lady
she
have
ever
see
visit
at
the
Chase
 
<EOS>
indeed
it
seem
fine
lady
be
rather
old
and
ugly
 
and
pretty
than
Miss
Bacon
,
the
miller
's
daughter
,
who
be
call
the
beauty
of
Treddleston
.
<EOS>
and
Hetty
look
at
herself
to
-
night
with
quite
a
different
sensation
from
what
she
have
ever
feel
before
;
there
be
an
invisible
spectator
whose
eye
rest
on
her
like
morning
on
the
flower
.
<EOS>
His
soft
voice
be
say
over
and
over
again
those
pretty
thing
she
have
hear
in
the
wood
;
his
arm
be
round
her
,
and
the
delicate
rose
-
scent
of
his
hair
be
with
her
still
.
<EOS>
the
vain
woman
be
never
thoroughly
conscious
of
her
own
beauty
till
she
be
love
by
the
man
who
set
her
own
passion
vibrate
in
return
.
  
<EOS>
but
Hetty
seem
to
have
make
up
her
mind
that
something
be
want
,
for
she
get
up
and
reach
an
old
black
lace
scarf
out
of
the
linen
-
press
,
and
a
pair
of
large
ear
-
ring
out
of
the
sacred
drawer
from
which
she
have
take
her
candle
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
old
old
scarf
,
full
of
rent
,
but
it
would
make
a
become
border
round
her
shoulder
,
and
set
off
the
whiteness
of
her
upper
arm
.
<EOS>
and
she
would
take
out
the
little
ear
-
ring
she
have
in
her
ear
 
<EOS>
oh
,
how
her
aunt
have
scold
her
for
have
her
ear
bore
!
 
and
put
in
those
large
one
.
<EOS>
They
be
but
coloured
glass
and
gilding
,
but
if
you
do
not
know
what
they
be
make
of
,
they
look
just
as
well
as
what
the
lady
wear
.
<EOS>
and
so
she
sit
down
again
,
with
the
large
ear
-
ring
in
her
ear
,
and
the
black
lace
scarf
adjust
round
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
She
look
down
at
her
arm
:
no
arm
could
be
pretty
down
to
a
little
way
below
the
elbow
 
<EOS>
they
be
white
and
plump
,
and
dimple
to
match
her
cheek
;
but
towards
the
wrist
,
she
think
with
vexation
that
they
be
coarsen
by
butter
-
making
and
other
work
that
lady
never
do
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Donnithorne
could
not
like
her
to
go
on
do
work
:
he
would
like
to
see
her
in
nice
clothe
,
and
thin
shoe
,
and
white
stocking
,
perhaps
with
silk
clock
to
them
;
for
he
must
love
her
very
much
 
<EOS>
no
one
else
have
ever
put
his
arm
round
her
and
kiss
her
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
He
would
want
to
marry
her
and
make
a
lady
of
her
;
she
could
hardly
dare
to
shape
the
thought
 
yet
how
else
could
it
be
?
<EOS>
marry
her
quite
secretly
,
as
Mr.
James
,
the
doctor
's
assistant
,
marry
the
doctor
's
niece
,
and
nobody
ever
find
it
out
for
a
long
while
after
,
and
then
it
be
of
no
use
to
be
angry
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
have
tell
her
aunt
all
about
it
in
Hetty
's
hearing
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
know
how
it
would
be
,
but
it
be
quite
plain
the
old
Squire
could
never
be
tell
anything
about
it
,
for
Hetty
be
ready
to
faint
with
awe
and
fright
if
she
come
across
him
at
the
Chase
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
be
earth
-
bear
,
for
what
she
know
.
<EOS>
It
have
never
enter
her
mind
that
he
have
be
young
like
other
man
;
he
have
always
be
the
old
Squire
at
whom
everybody
be
frightened
.
<EOS>
oh
,
it
be
impossible
to
think
how
it
would
be
!
<EOS>
but
Captain
Donnithorne
would
know
;
he
be
a
great
gentleman
,
and
could
have
his
way
in
everything
,
and
could
buy
everything
he
like
.
<EOS>
and
nothing
could
be
as
it
have
be
again
:
perhaps
some
day
she
should
be
a
grand
lady
,
and
ride
in
her
coach
,
and
dress
for
dinner
in
a
brocaded
silk
,
with
feather
in
her
hair
,
and
her
dress
sweep
the
ground
,
like
Miss
Lydia
and
Lady
Dacey
,
when
she
see
them
go
into
the
dining
-
room
one
evening
as
she
peep
through
the
little
round
window
in
the
lobby
;
only
she
should
not
be
old
and
ugly
like
Miss
Lydia
,
or
all
the
same
thickness
like
Lady
Dacey
,
but
very
pretty
,
with
her
hair
do
in
a
great
many
different
way
,
and
sometimes
in
a
pink
dress
,
and
sometimes
in
a
white
one
 
she
do
not
know
which
she
like
best
;
and
Mary
Burge
and
everybody
would
perhaps
see
her
go
out
in
her
carriage
 
or
rather
<EOS>
,
they
would
hear
of
it
:
it
be
impossible
to
imagine
these
thing
happen
at
Hayslope
in
sight
of
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
at
the
thought
of
all
this
splendour
,
Hetty
get
up
from
her
chair
,
and
in
do
so
catch
the
little
red
-
framed
glass
with
the
edge
of
her
scarf
,
so
that
it
fall
with
a
bang
on
the
floor
;
but
she
be
too
eagerly
occupy
with
her
vision
to
care
about
pick
it
up
;
and
after
a
momentary
start
,
begin
to
pace
with
a
pigeon
-
like
stateliness
backwards
and
forwards
along
her
room
,
in
her
coloured
stay
and
colour
skirt
,
and
the
old
black
lace
scarf
round
her
shoulder
,
and
the
great
glass
ear
-
ring
in
her
ear
.
  
<EOS>
how
pretty
the
little
puss
look
in
that
odd
dress
!
<EOS>
It
would
be
the
easy
folly
in
the
world
to
fall
in
love
with
her
:
there
be
such
a
sweet
babylike
roundness
about
her
face
and
figure
;
the
delicate
dark
ring
of
hair
lie
so
charmingly
about
her
ear
and
neck
;
her
great
dark
eye
with
their
long
eye
-
lash
touch
one
so
strangely
,
as
if
an
imprison
frisky
sprite
look
out
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
ah
,
what
a
prize
the
man
get
who
win
a
sweet
bride
like
Hetty
!
<EOS>
how
the
man
envy
him
who
come
to
the
wedding
breakfast
,
and
see
her
hang
on
his
arm
in
her
white
lace
and
orange
blossom
.
<EOS>
the
dear
,
young
,
round
,
soft
,
flexible
thing
!
<EOS>
Her
heart
must
be
just
as
soft
,
her
temper
just
as
free
from
angle
,
her
character
just
as
pliant
.
<EOS>
if
anything
ever
go
wrong
,
it
must
be
the
husband
's
fault
there
:
he
can
make
her
what
he
like
 
<EOS>
that
be
plain
.
<EOS>
and
the
lover
himself
think
so
too
:
the
little
darling
be
so
fond
of
him
,
her
little
vanity
be
so
bewitching
,
he
would
not
consent
to
her
be
a
bit
wise
;
those
kittenlike
glance
and
movement
be
just
what
one
want
to
make
one
's
hearth
a
paradise
.
<EOS>
every
man
under
such
circumstance
be
conscious
of
be
a
great
physiognomist
.
<EOS>
nature
,
he
know
,
have
a
language
of
her
own
,
which
she
use
with
strict
veracity
,
and
he
consider
himself
an
adept
in
the
language
.
<EOS>
nature
have
write
out
his
bride
's
character
for
him
in
those
exquisite
line
of
cheek
and
lip
and
chin
,
in
those
eyelid
delicate
as
petal
,
in
those
long
lash
curl
like
the
staman
of
a
flower
,
in
the
dark
liquid
depth
of
those
wonderful
eye
.
<EOS>
how
she
will
dote
on
her
child
!
<EOS>
She
be
almost
a
child
herself
,
and
the
little
pink
round
thing
will
hang
about
her
like
floret
round
the
central
flower
;
and
the
husband
will
look
on
,
smile
benignly
,
able
,
whenever
he
choose
,
to
withdraw
into
the
sanctuary
of
his
wisdom
,
towards
which
his
sweet
wife
will
look
reverently
,
and
never
lift
the
curtain
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
marriage
such
as
they
make
in
the
golden
age
,
when
the
man
be
all
wise
and
majestic
and
the
woman
all
lovely
and
loving
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
much
in
this
way
that
our
friend
Adam
Bede
think
about
Hetty
;
only
he
put
his
thought
into
different
word
.
<EOS>
if
ever
she
behave
with
cold
vanity
towards
him
,
he
say
to
himself
it
be
only
because
she
do
not
love
me
well
enough
;
and
he
be
sure
that
her
love
,
whenever
she
give
it
,
would
be
the
most
precious
thing
a
man
could
possess
on
earth
.
<EOS>
before
you
despise
Adam
as
deficient
in
penetration
,
pray
ask
yourself
if
you
be
ever
predispose
to
believe
evil
of
any
pretty
woman
 
<EOS>
if
you
ever
COULD
,
without
hard
head
-
break
demonstration
,
believe
evil
of
the
one
supremely
pretty
woman
who
have
bewitch
you
.
<EOS>
no
:
people
who
love
downy
peach
be
apt
not
to
think
of
the
stone
,
and
sometimes
jar
their
tooth
terribly
against
it
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
Donnithorne
,
too
,
have
the
same
sort
of
notion
about
Hetty
,
so
far
as
he
have
think
of
her
nature
of
all
.
<EOS>
He
feel
sure
she
be
a
dear
,
affectionate
,
good
little
thing
.
<EOS>
the
man
who
awake
the
wonder
tremulous
passion
of
a
young
girl
always
think
her
affectionate
;
and
if
he
chance
to
look
forward
to
future
year
,
probably
imagine
himself
be
virtuously
tender
to
her
,
because
the
poor
thing
be
so
clingingly
fond
of
him
.
<EOS>
God
make
these
dear
woman
so
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
a
convenient
arrangement
in
case
of
sickness
.
  
<EOS>
after
all
,
I
believe
the
wise
of
us
must
be
beguile
in
this
way
sometimes
,
and
must
think
both
well
and
bad
of
people
than
they
deserve
.
<EOS>
nature
have
her
language
,
and
she
be
not
unveracious
;
but
we
do
not
know
all
the
intricacy
of
her
syntax
just
yet
,
and
in
a
hasty
read
we
may
happen
to
extract
the
very
opposite
of
her
real
meaning
.
<EOS>
long
dark
eyelash
,
now
 
what
can
be
more
exquisite
?
<EOS>
I
find
it
impossible
not
to
expect
some
depth
of
soul
behind
a
deep
grey
eye
with
a
long
dark
eyelash
,
in
spite
of
an
experience
which
have
show
me
that
they
may
go
along
with
deceit
,
peculation
,
and
stupidity
.
<EOS>
but
if
,
in
the
reaction
of
disgust
,
I
have
betake
myself
to
a
fishy
eye
,
there
have
be
a
surprising
similarity
of
result
.
<EOS>
one
begin
to
suspect
at
length
that
there
be
no
direct
correlation
between
eyelash
and
moral
;
or
else
,
that
the
eyelash
express
the
disposition
of
the
fair
one
's
grandmother
,
which
be
on
the
whole
less
important
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
no
eyelash
could
be
more
beautiful
than
Hetty
's
;
and
now
,
while
she
walk
with
her
pigeon
-
like
stateliness
along
the
room
and
look
down
on
her
shoulder
border
by
the
old
black
lace
,
the
dark
fringe
show
to
perfection
on
her
pink
cheek
.
<EOS>
They
be
but
dim
ill
-
define
picture
that
her
narrow
bit
of
an
imagination
can
make
of
the
future
;
but
of
every
picture
she
be
the
central
figure
in
fine
clothe
;
Captain
Donnithorne
be
very
close
to
her
,
put
his
arm
round
her
,
perhaps
kiss
her
,
and
everybody
else
be
admire
and
envy
her
 
especially
Mary
Burge
,
whose
new
print
dress
look
very
contemptible
by
the
side
of
Hetty
's
resplendent
toilette
.
<EOS>
do
any
sweet
or
sad
memory
mingle
with
this
dream
of
the
future
 
any
loving
thought
of
her
second
parent
 
of
the
child
she
have
help
to
tend
 
of
any
youthful
companion
,
any
pet
animal
,
any
relic
of
her
own
childhood
even
?
<EOS>
not
one
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
plant
that
have
hardly
any
root
:
you
may
tear
them
from
their
native
nook
of
rock
or
wall
,
and
just
lay
them
over
your
ornamental
flower
-
pot
,
and
they
blossom
none
the
bad
.
<EOS>
Hetty
could
have
cast
all
her
past
life
behind
her
and
never
care
to
be
remind
of
it
again
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
have
no
feeling
at
all
towards
the
old
house
,
and
do
not
like
the
Jacob
's
Ladder
and
the
long
row
of
hollyhock
in
the
garden
better
than
other
flower
 
perhaps
not
so
well
.
<EOS>
It
be
wonderful
how
little
she
seem
to
care
about
wait
on
her
uncle
,
who
have
be
a
good
father
to
her
 
<EOS>
she
hardly
ever
remember
to

Hetty
do
not
understand
how
anybody
could
be
very
fond
of
middle

aged
people
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
those
tiresome
child
,
Marty
and
Tommy
and
Totty
,
they
have
be
the
very
nuisance
of
her
life
 
as
bad
as
buzz
insect
that
will
come
tease
you
on
a
hot
day
when
you
want
to
be
quiet

<EOS>
marty
,
the

be
a
baby
when
she
first
come
to
the
farm
,
for
the
child
bear
before
him
have
die
,
and
so
Hetty
have
have
them
all
three
,
one
after
the
other
,
toddle
by
her
side
in
the
meadow
,
or
play
about
her
on
wet
day
in
the
half
-
empty
room
of
the
large
old
house
.
<EOS>
the
boy
be
out
of
hand
now
,
but
Totty
be
still
a
day
-
long
plague
,
bad
than
either
of
the
other
have
be
,
because
there
be
more
fuss
make
about
her
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
no
end
to
the
making
and
mending
of
clothe
.
<EOS>
Hetty
would
have
be
glad
to
hear
that
she
should
never
see
a
child
again
;
they
be
bad
than
the
nasty
little
lamb
that
the
shepherd
be
always
bring
in
to
be
take
special
care
of
in
lambing
time
;
for
the
lamb
be
get
rid
of
sooner
or
later
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
young
chicken
and
turkey
,
Hetty
would
have
hate
the
very
word
"
hatching
,
"
if
her
aunt
have
not
bribe
her
to
attend
to
the
young
poultry
by
promise
her
the
proceed
of
one
out
of
every
brood
.
<EOS>
the
round
downy
chick
peep
out
from
under
their
mother
's
wing
never
touch
Hetty
with
any
pleasure
;
that
be
not
the
sort
of
prettiness
she
care
about
,
but
she
do
care
about
the
prettiness
of
the
new
thing
she
would
buy
for
herself
at
Treddleston
Fair
with
the
money
they
fetch
.
<EOS>
and
yet
she
look
so
dimpled
,
so
charming
,
as
she
stoop
down
to
put
the
soak
bread
under
the
hen
-
coop
,
that
you
must
have
be
a
very
acute
personage
indeed
to
suspect
her
of
that
hardness
.
<EOS>
molly
,
the
housemaid
,
with
a
turn
-
up
nose
and
a
protuberant
jaw
,
be
really
a
tender
-
hearted
girl
,
and
,
as
Mrs.
Poyser
say
,
a
jewel
to
look
after
the
poultry
;
but
her
stolid
face
show
nothing
of
this
maternal
delight
,
any
more
than
a
brown
earthenware
pitcher
will
show
the
light
of
the
lamp
within
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
generally
a
feminine
eye
that
first
detect
the
moral
deficiency
hide
under
the
"
dear
deceit
"
of
beauty
,
so
it
be
not
surprising
that
Mrs.
Poyser
,
with
her
keenness
and
abundant
opportunity
for
observation
,
should
have
form
a
tolerably
fair
estimate
of
what
may
be
expect
from
Hetty
in
the
way
of
feeling
,
and
in
moment
of
indignation
she
have
sometimes
speak
with
great
openness
on
the
subject
to
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
no
well
than
a

Nay

She

<EOS>
Hetty
stand
sufficiently
in
awe
of
her
aunt
to
be
anxious
to
conceal
from
her
so
much
of
her
vanity
as
could
be
hide
without
too
great
a
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
resist
spend
her
money
in
bit
of
finery
which
Mrs.
Poyser
disapprove
;
but
she
would
have
be
ready
to
die
with
shame
,
vexation
,
and
fright
if
her
aunt
have
this
moment
open
the
door
,
and
see
her
with
her
bit
of
candle
light
,
and
strut
about
deck
in
her
scarf
and
ear
-
ring
.
<EOS>
to
prevent
such
a
surprise
,
she
always
bolt
her
door
,
and
she
have
not
forget
to
do
so
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
:
for
there
now
come
a
light
tap
,
and
Hetty
,
with
a
leap
heart
,
rush
to
blow
out
the
candle
and
throw
them
into
the
drawer
.
<EOS>
She
dare
not
stay
to
take
out
her
ear
-
ring
,
but
she
throw
off
her
scarf
,
and
let
it
fall
on
the
floor
,
before
the
light
tap
come
again
.
<EOS>
We
shall
know
how
it
be
that
the
light
tap
come
,
if
we
leave
Hetty
for
a
short
time
and
return
to
Dinah
,
at
the
moment
when
she
have
deliver
Totty
to
her
mother
's
arm
,
and
be
come
upstairs
to
her
bedroom
,
adjoin
Hetty
's
.
  
<EOS>
Dinah
delight
in
her
bedroom
window
.
<EOS>
be
on
the
second
story
of
that
tall
house
,
it
give
her
a
wide
view
over
the
field
.
<EOS>
the
thickness
of
the
wall
form
a
broad
step
about
a
yard
below
the
window
,
where
she
could
place
her
chair
.
<EOS>
and
now
the
first
thing
she
do
on
enter
her
room
be
to
seat
herself
in
this
chair
and
look
out
on
the
peaceful
field
beyond
which
the
large
moon
be
rise
,
just
above
the
hedgerow
elm
.
<EOS>
She
like
the
pasture
best
where
the
milch
cow
be
lie
,
and
next
to
that
the
meadow
where
the
grass
be
half
-
mown
,
and
lie
in
silvered
sweeping
line
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
be
very
full
,
for
there
be
to
be
only
one
more
night
on
which
she
would
look
out
on
those
field
for
a
long
time
to
come
;
but
she
think
little
of
leave
the
mere
scene
,
for
,
to
her
,
bleak
Snowfield
have
just
as
many
charm
.
<EOS>
She
think
of
all
the
dear
people
whom
she
have
learn
to
care
for
among
these
peaceful
field
,
and
who
would
now
have
a
place
in
her
love
remembrance
for
ever
.
<EOS>
She
think
of
the
struggle
and
the
weariness
that
may
lie
before
them
in
the
rest
of
their
life
's
journey
,
when
she
would
be
away
from
them
,
and
know
nothing
of
what
be
befall
them
;
and
the
pressure
of
this
thought
soon
become
too
strong
for
her
to
enjoy
the
unresponde
stillness
of
the
moonlit
field
.
<EOS>
She
close
her
eye
,
that
she
may
feel
more
intensely
the
presence
of
a
Love
and
Sympathy
deep
and
more
tender
than
be
breathe
from
the
earth
and
sky
.
<EOS>
that
be
often
Dinah
's
mode
of
pray
in
solitude
.
<EOS>
simply
to
close
her
eye
and
to
feel
herself
enclose
by
the
Divine
Presence
;
then
gradually
her
fear
,
her
yearning
anxiety
for
other
,
melt
away
like
ice
-
crystal
in
a
warm
ocean
.
<EOS>
She
have
sit
in
this
way
perfectly
still
,
with
her
hand
cross
on
her
lap
and
the
pale
light
rest
on
her
calm
face
,
for
at
least
ten
minute
when
she
be
startle
by
a
loud
sound
,
apparently
of
something
fall
in
Hetty
's
room
.
<EOS>
but
like
all
sound
that
fall
on
our
ear
in
a
state
of
abstraction
,
it
have
no
distinct
character
,
but
be
simply
loud
and
startling
,
so
that
she
feel
uncertain
whether
she
have
interpret
it
rightly
.
<EOS>
She
rise
and
listen
,
but
all
be
quiet
afterwards
,
and
she
reflect
that
Hetty
may
merely
have
knock
something
down
in
get
into
bed
.
<EOS>
She
begin
slowly
to
undress
;
but
now
,
owe
to
the
suggestion
of
this
sound
,
her
thought
become
concentrated
on
Hetty
 
<EOS>
that
sweet
young
thing
,
with
life
and
all
its
trial
before
her
 
the
solemn
daily
duty
of
the
wife
and
mother
 
and
her
mind
so
unprepared
for
them
all
,
bent
merely
on
little
foolish
,
selfish
pleasure
,
like
a
child
hug
its
toy
in
the
beginning
of
a
long
toilsome
journey
in
which
it
will
have
to
bear
hunger
and
cold
and
unsheltered
darkness
.
<EOS>
Dinah
feel
a
double
care
for
Hetty
,
because
she
share
Seth
's
anxious
interest
in
his
brother
's
lot
,
and
she
have
not
come
to
the
conclusion
that
Hetty
do
not
love
Adam
well
enough
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
She
see
too
clearly
the
absence
of
any
warm
,
self
-
devoting
love
in
Hetty
's
nature
to
regard
the
coldness
of
her
behaviour
towards
Adam
as
any
indication
that
he
be
not
the
man
she
would
like
to
have
for
a
husband
.
<EOS>
and
this
blank
in
Hetty
's
nature
,
instead
of
exciting
Dinah
's
dislike
,
only
touch
her
with
a
deep
pity
:
<EOS>
the
lovely
face
and
form
affect
her
as
beauty
always
affect
a
pure
and
tender
mind
,
free
from
selfish
jealousy
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
excellent
divine
gift
,
that
give
a
deep
pathos
to
the
need
,
the
sin
,
the
sorrow
with
which
it
be
mingle
,
as
the
canker
in
a
lily
-
white
bud
be
more
grievous
to
behold
than
in
a
common
pot
-
herb
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
time
Dinah
have
undress
and
put
on
her
night
-
gown
,
this
feeling
about
Hetty
have
gather
a
painful
intensity
;
her
imagination
have
create
a
thorny
thicket
of
sin
and
sorrow
,
in
which
she
see
the
poor
thing
struggle
tear
and
bleed
,
look
with
tear
for
rescue
and
find
none
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
this
way
that
Dinah
's
imagination
and
sympathy
act
and
react
habitually
,
each
heighten
the
other
.
<EOS>
She
feel
a
deep
longing
to
go
now
and
pour
into
Hetty
's
ear
<EOS>
all
the
word
of
tender
warning
and
appeal
that
rush
into
her
mind
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
Hetty
be
already
asleep
.
<EOS>
Dinah
put
her
ear
to
the
partition
and
hear
still
some
slight
noise
,
which
convince
her
that
Hetty
be
not
yet
in
bed
.
<EOS>
still
she
hesitate
;
she
be
not
quite
certain
of
a
divine
direction
;
the
voice
that
tell
her
to
go
to
Hetty
seem
no
strong
than
the
other
voice
which
say
that
Hetty
be
weary
,
and
that
go
to
her
now
in
an
unseasonable
moment
would
only
tend
to
close
her
heart
more
obstinately
.
<EOS>
Dinah
be
not
satisfied
without
a
more
unmistakable
guidance
than
those
inward
voice
.
<EOS>
there
be
light
enough
for
her
,
if
she
open
her
Bible
,
to
discern
the
text
sufficiently
to
know
what
it
would
say
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
know
the
physiognomy
of
every
page
,
and
could
tell
on
what
book
she
open
,
sometimes
on
what
chapter
,
without
see
title
or
number
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
small
thick
Bible
,
wear
quite
round
at
the
edge
.
<EOS>
Dinah
lay
it
sideways
on
the
window
ledge
,
where
the
light
be
strong
,
and
then
open
it
with
her
forefinger
.
<EOS>
the
first
word
she
look
at
be
those
at
the
top
of
the
left
-
hand
page
:
"
and
they
all
weep
sore
,
and
fall
on
Paul
's
neck
and
kiss
him
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
enough
for
Dinah
;
she
have
open
on
that
memorable
parting
at
Ephesus
,
when
Paul
have
feel
bind
to
open
his
heart
in
a
last
exhortation
and
warning
.
<EOS>
She
hesitate
no
longer
,
but
,
open
her
own
door
gently
,
go
and
tap
on
Hetty
's
.
<EOS>
We
know
she
have
to
tap
twice
,
because
Hetty
have
to
put
out
her
candle
and
throw
off
her
black
lace
scarf
;
but
after
the
second
tap
the
door
be
open
immediately
.
<EOS>
Dinah
say
,
"
Will
you
let
me
come
in
,
Hetty
?
"
and
Hetty
,
without
speak
,
for
she
be
confused
and
vexed
,
open
the
door
wider
and
let
her
in
.
  
<EOS>
what
a
strange
contrast
the
two
figure
make
,
visible
enough
in
that
mingle
twilight
and
moonlight
!
<EOS>
Hetty
,
her
cheek
flush
and
her
eye
glisten
from
her
imaginary
drama
,
her
beautiful
neck
and
arm
bare
,
her
hair
hang
in
a
curly
tangle
down
her
back
,
and
the
bauble
in
her
ear
.
<EOS>
Dinah
,
cover
with
her
long
white
dress
,
her
pale
face
full
of
subdued
emotion
,
almost
like
a
lovely
corpse
into
which
the
soul
have
return
charge
with
sublimer
secret
and
a
sublimer
love
.
<EOS>
They
be
nearly
of
the
same
height
;
Dinah
evidently
a
little
the
tall
as
she
put
her
arm
round
Hetty
's
waist
and
kiss
her
forehead
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
be
not
in
bed
,
my
dear
,
"
she
say
,
in
her
sweet
clear
voice
,
which
be
irritate
to
Hetty
,
mingle
with
her
own
peevish
vexation
like
music
with
jangle
chain
,
"
<EOS>
for
I
hear
you
move
;
and
I
long
to
speak
to
you
again
to
-
night
,
for
it
be
the
last
but
one
that
I
shall
be
here
,
and
we
do
not
know
what
may
happen
to
-
morrow
to
keep
us
apart
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
sit
down
with
you
while
you
do
up
your
hair
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
,
"
say
Hetty
,
hastily
turn
round
and
reach
the
second
chair
in
the
room
,
glad
that
Dinah
look
as
if
she
do
not
notice
her
ear
-
ring
.
  
<EOS>
Dinah
sit
down
,
and
Hetty
begin
to
brush
together
her
hair
before
twist
it
up
,
do
it
with
that
air
of
excessive
indifference
which
belong
to
confused
self
-
consciousness
.
<EOS>
but
the
expression
of
Dinah
's
eye
gradually
relieve
her
;
they
seem
unobservant
of
all
detail
.
  
<EOS>
"
dear
Hetty
,
"
she
say
,
"
It
have
be
bear
in
upon
my
mind
to
-
night
that
you
may
some
day
be
in
trouble
 
<EOS>
trouble
be
appoint
for
us
all
here
below
,
and
there
come
a
time
when
we
need
more
comfort
and
help
than
the
thing
of
this
life
can
give
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
tell
you
that
if
ever
you
be
in
trouble
,
and
need
a
friend
that
will
always
feel
for
you
and
love
you
,
you
have
get
that
friend
in
Dinah
Morris
at
Snowfield
,
and
if
you
come
to
her
,
or
send
for
her
,
she
will
never
forget
this
night
and
the
word
she
be
speak
to
you
now
.
<EOS>
Will
you
remember
it
,
Hetty
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Hetty
,
rather
frightened
.
<EOS>
"
but
why
should
you
think
I
shall
be
in
trouble
?
<EOS>
do
you
know
of
anything
?
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
have
seat
herself
as
she
tie
on
her
cap
,
and
now
Dinah
lean
forwards
and
take
her
hand
as
she
answer
,
"
because
,
dear
,
trouble
come
to
us
all
in
this
life
:
we
set
our
heart
on
thing
which
it
be
not
God
's
will
for
us
to
have
,
and
then
we
go
sorrow
;
the
people
we
love
be
take
from
us
,
and
we
can
joy
in
nothing
because
they
be
not
with
us
;
sickness
come
,
and
we
faint
under
the
burden
of
our
feeble
body
;
we
go
astray
and
do
wrong
,
and
bring
ourselves
into
trouble
with
our
fellow
-
man
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
man
or
woman
bear
into
this
world
to
whom
some
of
these
trial
do
not
fall
,
and
so
I
feel
that
some
of
them
must
happen
to
you
;
and
I
desire
for
you
,
that
while
you
be
young
you
should
seek
for
strength
from
your
Heavenly
Father
,
that
you
may
have
a
support
which
will
not
fail
you
in
the
evil
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
pause
and
release
Hetty
's
hand
that
she
may
not
hinder
her
.
<EOS>
Hetty
sit
quite
still
;
she
feel
no
response
within
herself
to
Dinah
's
anxious
affection
;
but
Dinah
's
word
utter
with
solemn
pathetic
distinctness
,
affect
her
with
a
chill
fear
.
<EOS>
Her
flush
have
die
away
almost
to
paleness
;
she
have
the
timidity
of
a
luxurious
pleasure
-
seek
nature
,
which
shrink
from
the
hint
of
pain
.
<EOS>
Dinah
see
the
effect
,
and
her
tender
anxious
pleading
become
the
more
earnest
,
till
Hetty
,
full
of
a
vague
fear
that
something
evil
be
some
time
to
befall
her
,
begin
to
cry
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
our
habit
to
say
that
while
the
low
nature
can
never
understand
the
high
,
the
high
nature
command
a
complete
view
of
the
low
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
the
high
nature
have
to
learn
this
comprehension
,
as
we
learn
the
art
of
vision
,
by
a
good
deal
of
hard
experience
,
often
with
bruise
and
gash
incur
in
take
thing
up
by
the
wrong
end
,
and
fancy
our
space
wider
than
it
be
.
<EOS>
Dinah
have
never
see
Hetty
affect
in
this
way
before
,
and
,
with
her
usual
benignant
hopefulness
,
she
trust
it
be
the
stirring
of
a
divine
impulse
.
<EOS>
She
kiss
the
sob
thing
,
and
begin
to
cry
with
her
for
grateful
joy
.
<EOS>
but
Hetty
be
simply
in
that
excitable
state
of
mind
in
which
there
be
no
calculate
what
turn
<EOS>
the
feeling
may
take
from
one
moment
to
another
,
and
for
the
first
time
she
become
irritated
under
Dinah
's
caress
.
<EOS>
She
push
her
away
impatiently
,
and
say
,
with
a
childish
sobbing
voice
,
"
do
not
talk
to
me
so
,
Dinah
.
<EOS>
why
do
you
come
to
frighten
me
?
<EOS>
I
have
never
do
anything
to
you
.
<EOS>
why
can
not
you
let
me
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Dinah
feel
a
pang
.
<EOS>
She
be
too
wise
to
persist
,
and
only
say
mildly
,
"
yes
,
my
dear
,
you
be
tired
;
I
will
not
hinder
you
any
longer
.
<EOS>
make
haste
and
get
into
bed
.
<EOS>
good
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
go
out
of
the
room
almost
as
quietly
and
quickly
as
if
she
have
be
a
ghost
;
but
once
by
the
side
of
her
own
bed
,
she
throw
herself
on
her
knee
and
pour
out
in
deep
silence
all
the
passionate
pity
that
fill
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Hetty
,
she
be
soon
in
the
wood
again
 
her
waking
dream
be
merge
in
a
sleep
life
scarcely
more
fragmentary
and
confused

ARTHUR
DONNITHORNE
,
you
remember
,
be
under
an
engagement
with
himself
to
go
and
see
Mr.
Irwine
this
Friday
morning
,
and
he
be
awake
and
dress
so
early
that
he
determine
to
go
before
breakfast
,
instead
of
after
.
<EOS>
the
rector
,
he
know
,
breakfast
alone
at
half
-
past
nine
,
the
lady
of
the
family
have
a
different
breakfast
-
hour
;
Arthur
will
have
an
early
ride
over
the
hill
and
breakfast
with
him
.
<EOS>
one
can
say
everything
good
over
a
meal
.
  
<EOS>
the
progress
of
civilization
have
make
a
breakfast
or
a
dinner
an
easy
and
cheerful
substitute
for
more
troublesome
and
disagreeable
ceremony
.
<EOS>
We
take
a
less
gloomy
view
of
our
error
now
our
father
confessor
listen
to
us
over
his
egg
and
coffee
.
<EOS>
We
be
more
distinctly
conscious
that
rude
penance
be
out
of
the
question
for
gentleman
in
an
enlighten
age
,
and
that
mortal
sin
be
not
incompatible
with
an
appetite
for
muffin
.
<EOS>
an
assault
on
our
pocket
,
which
in
more
barbarous
time
would
have
be
make
in
the
brusque
form
of
a
pistol
-
shot
,
be
quite
a
well
-
breed
and
smile
procedure
<EOS>
now
it
have
become
a
request
for
a
loan
throw
in
as
an
easy
parenthesis
between
the
second
and
third
glass
of
claret
.
  
<EOS>
still
,
there
be
this
advantage
in
the
old
rigid
form
,
that
they
commit
you
to
the
fulfilment
of
a
resolution
by
some
outward
deed
:
<EOS>
when
you
have
put
your
mouth
to
one
end
of
a
hole
in
a
stone
wall
and
be
aware
that
there
be
an
expectant
ear
at
the
other
end
,
you
be
more
likely
to
say
what
you
come
out
with
the
intention
of
say
than
if
you
be
seat
with
your
leg
in
an
easy
attitude
under
the
mahogany
with
a
companion
who
will
have
no
reason
to
be
surprised
if
you
have
nothing
particular
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
Arthur
Donnithorne
,
as
he
wind
among
the
pleasant
lane
on
horseback
in
the
morning
sunshine
,
have
a
sincere
determination
to
open
his
heart
to
the
rector
,
and
the
swirl
sound
of
the
scythe
as
he
pass
by
the
meadow
be
all
the
pleasanter
to
him
because
of
this
honest
purpose
.
<EOS>
He
be
glad
to
see
the
promise
of
settled
weather
now
,
for
get
in
the
hay
,
about
which
the
farmer
have
be
fearful
;
and
there
be
something
so
healthful
in
the
sharing
of
a
joy
that
be
general
and
not
merely
personal
,
that
this
think
about
the
hay
-
harvest
react
on
his
state
of
mind
and
make
his
resolution
seem
an
easy
matter
.
<EOS>
a
man
about
town
may
perhaps
consider
that
these
influence
be
not
to
be
feel
out
of
a
child
's
story
-
book
;
but
when
you
be
among
the
field
and
hedgerow
,
it
be
impossible
to
maintain
a
consistent
superiority
to
simple
natural
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
have
pass
the
village
of
Hayslope
and
be
approach
the
Broxton
side
of
the
hill
,
when
,
at
a
turning
in
the
road
,
he
see
a
figure
about
a
hundred
yard
before
him
which
it
be
impossible
to
mistake
for
any
one
else
than
Adam
Bede
,
even
if
there
have
be
no
grey
,
tailless
shepherd
-
dog
at
his
heel
.
<EOS>
He
be
stride
along
at
his
usual
rapid
pace
,
and
Arthur
push
on
his
horse
to
overtake
him
,
for
he
retain
too
much
of
his
boyish
feeling
for
Adam
to
miss
an
opportunity
of
chat
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
that
his
love
for
that
good
fellow
do
not
owe
some
of
its
force
to
the
love
of
patronage
:
our
friend
Arthur
like
to
do
everything
that
be
handsome
,
and
to
have
his
handsome
deed
recognize
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
look
round
as
he
hear
the
quicken
clatter
of
the
horse
's
heel
,
and
wait
for
the
horseman
,
lift
his
paper
cap
from
his
head
with
a
bright
smile
of
recognition
.
<EOS>
next
to
his
own
brother
Seth
,
Adam
would
have
do
more
for
Arthur
Donnithorne
than
for
any
other
young
man
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
there
be
hardly
anything
he
would
not
rather
have
lose
than
the
two
-
foot
ruler
which
he
always
carry
in
his
pocket
;
it
be
Arthur
's
present
,
buy
with
his
pocket
-
money
when
he
be
a
fair
-
haired
lad
of
eleven
,
and
when
he
have
profit
so
well
by
Adam
's
lesson
in
carpenter
and
turn
as
to
embarrass
every
female
in
the
house
with
gift
of
superfluous
thread
-
reel
and
round
box
.
<EOS>
Adam
have
quite
a
pride
in
the
little
squire
in
those
early
day
,
and
the
feeling
have
only
become
slightly
modify
as
the
fair
-
haired
lad
have
grow
into
the
whisker
young
man
.
<EOS>
Adam
,
I
confess
,
be
very
susceptible
to
the
influence
of
rank
,
and
quite
ready
to
give
an
extra
amount
of
respect
to
every
one
who
have
more
advantage
than
himself
,
not
be
a
philosopher
or
a
proletaire
with
democratic
idea
,
but
simply
a
stout
-
limbed
clever
carpenter
with
a
large
fund
of
reverence
in
his
nature
,
which
incline
him
to
admit
all
establish
claim
unless
he
see
very
clear
ground
for
question
them
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
theory
about
set
the
world
to
right
,
but
he
see
there
be
a
great
deal
of
damage
do
by
build
with
ill
-
season
timber
 
by
ignorant
man
in
fine
clothe
make
plan
for
outhouse
and
workshop
and
the
like
without
know
the
bearing
of
thing
 
by
slovenly
joiner
'
work
,
and
by
hasty
contract
that
could
never
be
fulfil
without
ruin
somebody
;
and
he
resolve
,
for
his
part
,
to
set
his
face
against
such
doing
.
<EOS>
on
these
point
he
would
have
maintain
his
opinion
against
the
large
landed
proprietor
in
Loamshire
or
Stonyshire
either
;
but
he
feel
that
beyond
these
it
would
be
well
for
him
to
defer
to
people
who
be
more
knowing
than
himself
.
<EOS>
He
see
as
plainly
as
possible
how
ill
the
wood
on
the
estate
be
manage
,
and
the
shameful
state
of
the
farm
-
building
;
and
if
old
Squire
Donnithorne
have
ask
him
the
effect
of
this
mismanagement
,
he
would
have
speak
his
opinion
without
flinch
,
but
the
impulse
to
a
respectful
demeanour
towards
a
"
gentleman
"
would
have
be
strong
within
him
all
the
while
.
<EOS>
the
word
"
gentleman
"
have
a
spell
for
Adam
,
and
,
as
he
often
say
,
he
"
could
not
abide
a
fellow
who
think
he
make
himself
fine
by
be
coxy
to
's
better
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
remind
you
again
that
Adam
have
the
blood
of
the
peasant
in
his
vein
,
and
that
since
he
be
in
his
prime
half
a
century
ago
,
you
must
expect
some
of
his
characteristic
to
be
obsolete
.
  
<EOS>
towards
the
young
squire
this
instinctive
reverence
of
Adam
's
be
assist
by
boyish
memory
and
personal
regard
<EOS>
so
you
may
imagine
that
he
think
far
more
of
Arthur
's
good
quality
,
and
attach
far
more
value
to
very
slight
action
of
his
,
than
if
they
have
be
the
quality
and
action
of
a
common
workman
like
himself
.
<EOS>
He
feel
sure
it
would
be
a
fine
day
for
everybody
about
Hayslope
when
the
young
squire
come
into
the
estate
 
such
a
generous
open
-
hearted
disposition
as
he
have
,
and
an
"
uncommon
"
notion
about
improvement
and
repair
,
consider
he
be
only
just
come
of
age
.
<EOS>
thus
there
be
both
respect
and
affection
in
the
smile
with
which
he
raise
his
paper
cap
as
Arthur
Donnithorne
ride
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Adam
,
how
be
you
?
"
say
Arthur
,
hold
out
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
never
shake
hand
with
any
of
the
farmer
,
and
Adam
feel
the
honour
keenly
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
swear
to
your
back
a
long
way
off
.
<EOS>
It
be
just
the
same
back
,
only
broad
,
as
when
you
use
to
carry
me
on
it
.
<EOS>
do
you
remember
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
sir
,
I
remember
.
<EOS>
It
'
ud
be
a
poor
look
-
out
if
folk
do
not
remember
what
they
do
and
say
when
they
be
lad
.
<EOS>
We
should
think
no
more
about
old
friend
than
we
do
about
new
un
,
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
go
to
Broxton
,
I
suppose
?
"
say
Arthur
,
put
his
horse
on
at
a
slow
pace
while
Adam
walk
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
"
be
you
go
to
the
rectory
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
,
I
be
go
to
see
about
Bradwell
's
barn
.
<EOS>
They
be
afraid
of
the
roof
push
the
wall
out
,
and
I
be
go
to
see
what
can
be
do
with
it
before
we
send
the
stuff
and
the
workman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
Burge
trust
almost
everything
to
you
now
,
Adam
,
do
not
he
?
<EOS>
I
should
think
he
will
make
you
his
partner
soon
.
<EOS>
He
will
,
if
he
be
wise
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
sir
,
I
do
not
see
as
he
would

much
the

off

<EOS>
a
foreman
,
if
he
be
get
a
conscience
and
delight
in
his
work
,
will
do
his
business
as
well
as
if
he
be
a
partner
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
give
a
penny
for
a
man
as
'

drive
a
nail
in
slack
because
he
do
not
get
extra
pay
for
it

"
  
<EOS>

I
know
that
,
Adam
;
I
know
you
work
for
him
as
well
as
if
you
be
work
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
but
you
would
have
more
power
than
you
have
now
,
and
could
turn
the
business
to
better
account
perhaps
.
<EOS>
the
old
man
must
give
up
his
business
sometime
,
and
he
have
no
son
;
I
suppose
he
will
want
a
son
-
in
-
law
who
can
take
to
it
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
rather
grasp
finger
of
his
own
<EOS>
,
I
fancy
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
he
want
a
man
who
can
put
some
money
into
the
business
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
not
as
poor
as
a
rat
,
I
would
gladly
invest
some
money
in
that
way
,
for
the
sake
of
have
you
settle
on
the
estate
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
should
profit
by
it
in
the
end
.
<EOS>
and
perhaps
I
shall
be
well
off
in
a
year
or
two
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
a
large
allowance
<EOS>
now
I
be
of
age
;
and
when
I
have
pay
off
a
debt
or
two
,
I
shall
be
able
to
look
about
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
good
to
say
so

I
be

Adam

I
should
not

I
see
no

to
dispose
of

I
should
be
glad

I
shall
be
glad
when
it

over

I

my

perhaps
get
easy
then

<EOS>
It
cut
one
sadly
to
see
the
grief
of
old
people
;
they
have
no
way
o

work
it
off
,

the

bring
no

why

yes

that
be
nothing

make
a

about

<EOS>
if

have

feeling

I
reckon
we
must
have

We
can
not

I

presently

now

you

I
fancy

up

it

as
easily

be
quarrelsome
with

you
be

shilly

shally

first
make
up

then
do
it
after

"
  
<EOS>
"
well

"

Adam

slowly

after
a
moment
's
hesitation

no

<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
ever
be
see

see
in
that
way

when
I
would
make
my
mind
up

as
you
say
,
that
a
thing
be
wrong

<EOS>
It
take
the
taste
out
o

my
mouth
for
thing
,
when
I
know
I
should
have
a
heavy
conscience
after
'em
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
pretty
clear
,
ever
since
I
could
cast
up
a
sum
,
as
you
can
never
do
what
be
wrong
without
breed
sin
and
trouble
more
than
you
can
ever
see
.
<EOS>
It
be
like
a
bit
o
'
bad
workmanship
 
<EOS>
you
never
see
th
'
end
o

the
mischief
it
will
do

it
be
a
poor
look

out

come
into

make
your

bad
off
instead
o

well

there
be
a
difference
between
the
thing
folk
call
wrong

I
be
not
for
make
a
sin
of
every
little
fool

trick

bit
o

nonsense
anybody
may
be
let
into

like
some
o

a

may
have
two
mind
whether
it
be
not
worthwhile
to
get
a
bruise
or
two
for
the
sake
of
a
bit
o

fun

<EOS>
but
it
be
not
my
way
to
be
see
-
see
about
anything

I

my

lie
th

other
way

<EOS>
when
I
have
say
a
thing

if
it
be
only
to

back

yes

You

<EOS>
"
why
,
sir

you
seem
to
think
o

college
something
like
what
Bartle

He
say
college
mostly
make
people
like

here
be
the

Carroll

we

want
more
coffee

have
not
you
get
some
cold
fowl

<EOS>
why

this

cold

<EOS>
Arthur
be
anxious
not
to
imply
that
he
come
with
any
special
purpose
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
sooner
find
himself
in
Mr.
Irwine
's
presence
than
the
confidence
which
he
have
think
quite
easy
before
,
suddenly
appear
the
most
difficult
thing
in
the
world
to
him
,
and
at
the
very
moment
of
shake
hand
he
see
his
purpose
in
quite
a
new
light
.
<EOS>
how
could
he
make
Irwine
understand
his
position
unless
he
tell
him
those
little
scene
in
the
wood
;
and
how
could
he
tell
them
without
look
like
a
fool
?
<EOS>
and
then
his
weakness
in
come
back
from
Gawaine
's
,
and
do
the
very
opposite
of
what
he
intend
!
<EOS>
Irwine
would
think
him
a
shilly
-
shally
fellow
ever
after
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
must
come
out
in
an
unpremeditated
way
;
the
conversation
may
lead
up
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
breakfast
-
time
well
than
any
other
moment
in
the
day
,
"
say
Mr.
Irwine
.
<EOS>
"
no
dust
have
settle
on
one
's
mind
then
,
and
it
present
a
clear
mirror
to
the
ray
of
thing
.
<EOS>
I
always
have
a
favourite
book
by
me
at
breakfast
,
and
I
enjoy
the
bit
I
pick
up
then
so
much
,
that
regularly
every
morning
it
seem
to
me
as
if
I
should
certainly
become
studious
again
.
<EOS>
but
presently
Dent
bring
up
a
poor
fellow
who
have
kill
a
hare
,
and
when
I
have
get
through
my
"
justicing
,
"
as
Carroll
call
it
,
I
be
incline
for
a
ride
round
the
glebe
,
and
on
my
way
back
I
meet
with
the
master
of
the
workhouse
,
who
have
get
a
long
story
of
a
mutinous
pauper
to
tell
me
;
and
so
the
day
go
on
,
<EOS>
and
I
be
always
the
same
lazy
fellow
before
evening
set
in
.
<EOS>
besides
,
one
want
the
stimulus
of
sympathy
,
and
I
have
never
have
that
since
poor
D'Oyley
leave
Treddleston
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
stick
to
your
book
<EOS>
well
,
you
rascal
,
I
should
have
have
a
pleasanter
prospect
before
me

<EOS>
but
scholarship
do
not
run
in
your
family
blood
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
no
indeed
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
if
I
can
remember
a
little
inapplicable
Latin
to
adorn
my
maiden
speech
in
Parliament
six
or
seven
year
hence
.
"
<EOS>
Cras
ingen
iterabimus
aequor
,
"
and
a
few
shred
of
that
sort
,
will
perhaps
stick
to
me
,
and
I
shall
arrange
my
opinion
so
as
to
introduce
them
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
think
a
knowledge
of
the
classic
be
a
press
want
to
a
country
gentleman
;
as
far
as
I
can
see
,
he
would
much
better
have
a
knowledge
of
manure
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
read
your
friend
Arthur
Young
's
book
lately
,
and
there
be
nothing
I
should
like
better
than
to
carry
out
some
of
his
idea
in
put
the
farmer
on
a
well
management
of
their
land
;
and
,
as
he
say
,
make
what
be
a
wild
country
,
all
of
the
same
dark
hue
,
bright
and
variegate
with
corn
and
cattle
.
<EOS>
My
grandfather
will
never
let
me
have
any
power
while
he
live
,
but
there
be
nothing
I
should
like
better
than
to
undertake
the
Stonyshire
side
of
the
estate
 
<EOS>
it
be
in
a
dismal
condition
 
and
set
improvement
on
foot
,
and
gallop
about
from
one
place
to
another
and
overlook
them
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
know
all
the
labourer
,
and
see
them
touch
their
hat
to
me
with
a
look
of
goodwill
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Bravo
,
Arthur
!
<EOS>
a
man
who
have
no
feeling
for
the
classic
could
not
make
a
well
apology
for
come
into
the
world
than
by
increase
the
quantity
of
food
to
maintain
scholar
 
and
rector
who
appreciate
scholar
.
<EOS>
and
whenever
you
enter
on
your
career
of
model
landlord
may
I
be
there
to
see
.
<EOS>
You
will
want
a
portly
rector
to
complete
the
picture
,
and
take
his
tithe
of
all
the
respect
and
honour
you
get
by
your
hard
work
.
<EOS>
only
do
not
set
your
heart
too
strongly
on
the
goodwill
you
be
to
get
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
sure
that
man
be
the
fond
of
those
who
try
to
be
useful
to
them
.
<EOS>
You
know
Gawaine
have
get
the
curse
of
the
whole
neighbourhood
upon
him
about
that
enclosure
.
<EOS>
You
must
make
it
quite
clear
to
your
mind
which
you
be
most
bent
upon
,
old
boy
 
popularity
or
usefulness
 
else
you
may
happen
to
miss
both
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
oh
!
<EOS>
Gawaine
be
harsh
in
his
manner
;
he
do
not
make
himself
personally
agreeable
to
his
tenant
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
there
be
anything
you
can
not
prevail
on
people
to
do
with
kindness
.
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
could
not
live
in
a
neighbourhood
where
I
be
not
respect
and
beloved
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
very
pleasant
to
go
among
the
tenant
here
 
<EOS>
they
seem
all
so
well
inclined
to
me
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
seem
only
the
other
day
to
them
since
I
be
a
little
lad
,
ride
on
a
pony
about
as
big
as
a
sheep
.
<EOS>
and
if
fair
allowance
be
make
to
them
,
and
their
building
attend
to
,
one
could
persuade
them
to
farm
on
a
well
plan
,
stupid
as
they
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
mind
you
fall
in
love
in
the
right
place
,
and
do
not
get
a
wife
who
will
drain
your
purse
and
make
you
niggardly
in
spite
of
yourself
.
<EOS>
My
mother
and
I
have
a
little
discussion
about
you
sometimes
:
she
say
,
"
I
will
never
risk
a
single
prophecy
on
Arthur
until
I
see
the
woman
he
fall
in
love
with
.
"
<EOS>
She
think
your
lady
-
love
will
rule
you
as
the
moon
rule
the
tide
.
<EOS>
but
I
feel
bind
to
stand
up
for
you
,
as
my
pupil
you
know
,
and
I
maintain
that
you
be
not
of
that
watery
quality
.
<EOS>
so
mind
you
do
not
disgrace
my
judgment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
wince
under
this
speech
,
for
keen
old
Mrs.
Irwine
's
opinion
about
him
have
the
disagreeable
effect
of
a
sinister
oman
.
<EOS>
this
,
to
be
sure
,
be
only
another
reason
for
persevere
in
his
intention
,
and
get
an
additional
security
against
himself
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
at
this
point
in
the
conversation
,
he
be
conscious
of
increase
disinclination
to
tell
his
story
about
Hetty
.
<EOS>
He
be
of
an
impressible
nature
,
and
live
a
great
deal
in
other
people
's
opinion
and
feeling
concern
himself
;
and
the
mere
fact
that
he
be
in
the
presence
of
an
intimate
friend
,
who
have
not
the
slight
notion
that
he
have
have
any
such
serious
internal
struggle
as
he
come
to
confide
,
rather
shake
his
own
belief
in
the
seriousness
of
the
struggle
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
,
after
all
,
a
thing
to
make
a
fuss
about
;
and
what
could
Irwine
do
for
him
that
he
could
not
do
for
himself
?
<EOS>
He
would
go
to
Eagledale
in
spite
of
Meg
's
lameness
 
go
on
Rattler
,
and
let
Pym
follow
as
well
as
he
could
on
the
old
hack
.
<EOS>
that
be
his
thought
as
he
sugar
his
coffee
;
but
the
next
minute
,
as
he
be
lift
the
cup
to
his
lip
,
he
remember
how
thoroughly
he
have
make
up
his
mind
last
night
to
tell
Irwine
.
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
He
would
not
be
vacillate
again
 
<EOS>
he
WOULD
do
what
he
have
mean
to
do
,
this
time
.
<EOS>
so
it
would
be
well
not
to
let
the
personal
tone
of
the
conversation
altogether
drop
.
<EOS>
if
they
go
to
quite
indifferent
topic
,
his
difficulty
would
be
heighten
.
<EOS>
It
have
require
no
noticeable
pause
for
this
rush
and
rebound
of
feeling
,
before
he
answer
,
"
but
I
think
it
be
hardly
an
argument
against
a
man
's
general
strength
of
character
that
he
should
be
apt
to
be
master
by
love
.
<EOS>
a
fine
constitution
do
not
insure
one
against
smallpox
or
any
other
of
those
inevitable
disease
.
<EOS>
a
man
may
be
very
firm
in
other
matter
and
yet
be
under
a
sort
of
witchery
from
a
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
but
there
be
this
difference
between
love
and
smallpox
,
or
bewitchment
either
 
that
if
you
detect
the
disease
at
an
early
stage
and
try
change
of
air
,
there
be
every
chance
of
complete
escape
without
any
further
development
of
symptom
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
certain
alternative
dose
which
a
man
may
administer
to
himself
by
keep
unpleasant
consequence
before
his
mind
:
this
give
you
a
sort
of
smoke
glass
through
which
you
may
look
at
the
resplendent
fair
one
and
discern
her
true
outline
;
though
I
be
afraid
,
by
the
by
,
the
smoke
glass
be
apt
to
be
miss
just
at
the
moment
it
be
most
want
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
,
now
,
even
a
man
fortify
with
a
knowledge
of
the
classic
may
be
lure
into
an
imprudent
marriage
,
in
spite
of
the
warning
give
him
by
the
chorus
in
the
Prometheus
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
smile
that
flit
across
Arthur
's
face
be
a
faint
one
,
and
instead
of
follow
Mr.
Irwine
's
playful
lead
,
he
say
,
quite
seriously
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
that
be
the
bad
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
desperately
vexatious
thing
,
that
after
all
one
's
reflection
and
quiet
determination
,
we
should
be
rule
by
mood
that
one
can
not
calculate
on
beforehand
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
a
man
ought
to
be
blame
so
much
if
he
be
betray
into
do
thing
in
that
way
,
in
spite
of
his
resolution
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
but
the
mood
lie
in
his
nature
,
my
boy
,
just
as
much
as
his
reflection
do
,
and
more
.
<EOS>
a
man
can
never
do
anything
at
variance
with
his
own
nature
.
<EOS>
He
carry
within
him
the
germ
of
his
most
exceptional
action
;
and
<EOS>
if
we
wise
people
make
eminent
fool
of
ourselves
on
any
particular
occasion
,
we
must
endure
the
legitimate
conclusion
that
we
carry
a
few
grain
of
folly
to
our
ounce
of
wisdom
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
one
may
be
betray
into
do
thing
by
a
combination
of
circumstance
,
which
one
may
never
have
do
otherwise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
yes
,
a
man
can
not
very
well
steal
a
bank
-
note
unless
the
bank
-
note
lie
within
convenient
reach
;
but
he
will
not
make
us
think
him
an
honest
man
because
he
begin
to
howl
at
the
bank
-
note
for
fall
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
surely
you
do
not
think
a
man
who
struggle
against
a
temptation
into
which
he
fall
at
last
as
bad
as
the
man
who
never
struggle
at
all
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
certainly
;
I
pity
him
in
proportion
to
his
struggle
,
for
they
foreshadow
the
inward
suffering
which
be
the
bad
form
of
Nemesis
.
<EOS>
consequence
be
unpitye
.
<EOS>
Our
deed
carry
their
terrible
consequence
,
quite
apart
from
any
fluctuation
that
go
before
 
consequence
that
be
hardly
ever
confine
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
good
to
fix
our
mind
on
that
certainty
,
instead
of
consider
what
may
be
the
element
of
excuse
for
us
.
<EOS>
but
I
never
know
you
so
inclined
for
moral
discussion
,
Arthur
?
<EOS>
be
it
some
danger
of
your
own
that
you
be
consider
in
this
philosophical
,
general
way
?
"
  
<EOS>
in
ask
this
question
,
Mr.
Irwine
push
his
plate
away
,
throw
himself
back
in
his
chair
,
and
look
straight
at
Arthur
.
<EOS>
He
really
suspect
that
Arthur
want
to
tell
him
something
,
and
think
of
smooth
the
way
for
him
by
this
direct
question
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
bring
suddenly
and
involuntarily
to
the
brink
of
confession
,
Arthur
shrink
back
and
feel
less
disposed
towards
it
than
ever
.
<EOS>
the
conversation
have
take
a
more
serious
tone
than
he
have
intend
 
<EOS>
it
would
quite
mislead
Irwine
 
he
would
imagine
there
be
a
deep
passion
for
Hetty
,
while
there
be
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
He
be
conscious
of
colouring
,
and
be
annoy
at
his
boyishness
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
no
,
no
danger
,
"
he
say
as
indifferently
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
I
be
more
liable
to
irresolution
than
other
people
;
only
there
be
little
incident
now
and
then
that
set
one
speculate
on
what
may
happen
in
the
future
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
be
there
a
motive
at
work
under
this
strange
reluctance
of
Arthur
's
which
have
a
sort
of
backstair
influence
,
not
admit
to
himself
?
<EOS>
Our
mental
business
be
carry
on
much
in
the
same
way
as
the
business
of
the
State
:
a
great
deal
of
hard
work
be
do
by
agent
who
be
not
acknowledge
.
<EOS>
in
a
piece
of
machinery
,
too
,
I
believe
there
be
often
a
small
unnoticeable
wheel
which
have
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
motion
of
the
large
obvious
one
.
<EOS>
possibly
there
be
some
such
unrecognized
agent
secretly
busy
in
Arthur
's
mind
at
this
moment
 
<EOS>
possibly
it
be
the
fear
lest
he
may
hereafter
find
the
fact
of
have
make
a
confession
to
the
rector
a
serious
annoyance
,
<EOS>
in
case
he
should
not
be
able
quite
to
carry
out
his
good
resolution
?
<EOS>
I
dare
not
assert
that
it
be
not
so
.
<EOS>
the
human
soul
be
a
very
complex
thing
.
  
<EOS>
the
idea
of
Hetty
have
just
cross
Mr.
Irwine
's
mind
as
he
look
inquiringly
at
Arthur
,
but
his
disclaim
indifferent
answer
confirm
the
thought
which
have
quickly
follow
 
that
there
could
be
nothing
serious
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
probability
that
Arthur
ever
see
her
except
at
church
,
and
at
her
own
home
under
the
eye
of
Mrs.
Poyser
;
and
the
hint
he
have
give
Arthur
about
her
the
other
day
have
no
more
serious
meaning
than
to
prevent
him
from
notice
her
so
as
to
rouse
the
little
chit
's
vanity
,
and
in
this
way
perturb
the
rustic
drama
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
Arthur
would
soon
join
his
regiment
,
and
be
far
away
:
<EOS>
no
,
there
could
be
no
danger
in
that
quarter
,
even
if
Arthur
's
character
have
not
be
a
strong
security
against
it
.
<EOS>
His
honest
,
patronizing
pride
in
the
good
-
will
and
respect
of
everybody
about
him
be
a
safeguard
even
against
foolish
romance
,
still
more
against
a
low
kind
of
folly
.
<EOS>
if
there
have
be
anything
special
on
Arthur
's
mind
in
the
previous
conversation
,
it
be
clear
he
be
not
inclined
to
enter
into
detail
,
and
Mr.
Irwine
be
too
delicate
to
imply
even
a
friendly
curiosity
.
<EOS>
He
perceive
a
change
of
subject
would
be
welcome
,
and
say
,
"
by
the
way
,
Arthur
,
at
your
colonel
's
birthday
fete
there
be
some
transparency
that
make
a
great
effect
in
honour
of
Britannia
,
and
Pitt
,
and
the
Loamshire
Militia
,
and
,
above
all
,
the
"
generous
youth
,
"
the
hero
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
you
should
get
up
something
of
the
same
sort
to
astonish
our
weak
mind
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
opportunity
be
go
.
<EOS>
while
Arthur
be
hesitate
,
the
rope
to
which
he
may
have
clung
have
drift
away
 
he
must
trust
now
to
his
own
swimming
.
  
<EOS>
in
ten
minute
from
that
time
,
Mr.
Irwine
be
call
for
on
business
,
and
Arthur
,
bid
him
good
-
bye
,
mount
his
horse
again
with
a
sense
of
dissatisfaction
,
which
he
try
to
quell
by
determine
to
set
off
for
Eagledale
without
an
hour
's
delay
.
      
<EOS>
in
which
the
Story
pause
a
little
  
"
this
rector
of
Broxton
be
little
well
than
a
pagan
!
<EOS>
"
I
hear
one
of
my
reader
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
how
much
more
edifying
it
would
have
be
if
you
have
make
him
give
Arthur
some
truly
spiritual
advice
!
<EOS>
You
may
have
put
into
his
mouth
the
most
beautiful
thing
 
quite
as
good
as
read
a
sermon
.
"
  
<EOS>
certainly
I
could
,
if
I
hold
it
the
high
vocation
of
the
novelist
to
represent
thing
as
they
never
have
be
and
never
will
be
.
<EOS>
then
,
of
course
,
I
may
refashion
life
and
character
entirely
after
my
own
liking
;
I
may
select
the
most
unexceptionable
type
of
clergyman
and
put
my
own
admirable
opinion
into
his
mouth
on
all
occasion
.
<EOS>
but
it
happen
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
my
strong
effort
be
to
avoid
any
such
arbitrary
picture
,
and
to
give
a
faithful
account
of
man
and
thing
as
they
have
mirror
themselves
in
my
mind
.
<EOS>
the
mirror
be
doubtless
defective
,
the
outline
will
sometimes
be
disturb
,
the
reflection
faint
or
confused
;
but
I
feel
as
much
bind
to
tell
you
as
precisely
as
I
can
what
that
reflection
be
,
as
if
I
be
in
the
witness
-
box
,
narrate
my
experience
on
oath
.
  
<EOS>
sixty
year
ago
 
it
be
a
long
time
,
so
<EOS>
no
wonder
thing
have
change
 
all
clergyman
be
not
zealous
;
indeed
,
there
be
reason
to
believe
that
the
number
of
zealous
clergyman
be
small
,
and
it
be
probable
that
if
one
among
the
small
minority
have
own
the
living
of
Broxton
and
Hayslope
in
the
year
1799
,
you
would
have
like
him
no
better
than
you
like
Mr.
Irwine
.
<EOS>
ten
to
one
,
you
would
have
think
him
a
tasteless
,
indiscreet
,
methodistical
man
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
very
rarely
that
fact
hit
that
nice
medium
require
by
our
own
enlighten
opinion
and
refined
taste
!
<EOS>
perhaps
you
will
say
,
"
do
improve
the
fact
a
little
,
then
;
make
them
more
accordant
with
those
correct
view
which
it
be
our
privilege
to
possess
.
<EOS>
the
world
be
not
just
what
we
like
;
do
touch
it
up
with
a
tasteful
pencil
,
and
make
believe
it
be
not
quite
such
a
mixed
entangled
affair
.
<EOS>
let
all
people
who
hold
unexceptionable
opinion
act
unexceptionably
.
<EOS>
let
your
most
faulty
character
always
be
on
the
wrong
side
,
and
your
virtuous
one
on
the
right
.
<EOS>
then
we
shall
see
at
a
glance
whom
we
be
to
condemn
and
whom
we
be
to
approve
.
<EOS>
then
we
shall
be
able
to
admire
,
without
the
slight
disturbance
of
our
prepossession
:
we
shall
hate
and
despise
with
that
true
ruminant
relish
which
belong
to
undoubte
confidence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
,
my
good
friend
,
what
will
you
do
then
with
your
fellow
-
parishioner
who
oppose
your
husband
in
the
vestry
?
<EOS>
with
your
newly
appoint
vicar
,
whose
style
of
preach
you
find
painfully
below
that
of
his
regretted
predecessor
?
<EOS>
with
the
honest
servant
who
worry
your
soul
with
her
one
fail
?
<EOS>
with
your
neighbour
,
Mrs.
Green
,
who
be
really
kind
to
you
in
your
last
illness
,
but
have
say
several
ill
-
natured
thing
about
you
since
your
convalescence
?
<EOS>
nay
,
with
your
excellent
husband
himself
,
who
have
other
irritate
habit
besides
that
of
not
wipe
his
shoe
?
<EOS>
these
fellow
-
mortal
,
every
one
,
must
be
accept
as
they
be
:
you
can
neither
straighten
their
nose
,
nor
brighten
their
wit
,
nor
rectify
their
disposition
;
and
it
be
these
people
 
amongst
whom
your
life
be
pass
 
that
it
be
needful
you
should
tolerate
,
pity
,
and
love
<EOS>
:
it
be
these
more
or
less
ugly
,
stupid
,
inconsistent
people
whose
movement
of
goodness
you
should
be
able
to
admire
 
for
whom
you
should
cherish
all
possible
hope
,
all
possible
patience
.
<EOS>
and
I
would
not
,
even
if
I
have
the
choice
,
be
the
clever
novelist
who
could
create
a
world
so
much
well
than
this
,
in
which
we
get
up
in
the
morning
to
do
our
daily
work
,
that
you
would
be
likely
to
turn
a
hard
,
cold
eye
on
the
dusty
street
and
the
common
green
field
 
on
the
real
breathing
man
and
woman
,
who
can
be
chill
by
your
indifference
or
injure
by
your
prejudice
;
who
can
be
cheer
and
help
onward
by
your
fellow
-
feeling
,
your
forbearance
,
your
outspoken
,
brave
justice
.
  
<EOS>
so
I
be
content
to
tell
my
simple
story
,
without
try
to
make
thing
seem
well
than
they
be
;
dread
nothing
,
indeed
,
but
falsity
,
which
,
in
spite
of
one
's
good
effort
,
there
be
reason
to
dread
.
<EOS>
falsehood
be
so
easy
,
truth
so
difficult
.
<EOS>
the
pencil
be
conscious
of
a
delightful
facility
in
draw
a
griffin
 
the
long
the
claws
,
and
the
large
the
wing
,
the
well
;
but
that
marvellous
facility
which
we
mistake
for
genius
be
apt
to
forsake
us
when
we
want
to
draw
a
real
unexaggerated
lion
.
<EOS>
examine
your
word
well
,
and
you
will
find
that
even
when
you
have
no
motive
to
be
false
,
it
be
a
very
hard
thing
to
say
the
exact
truth
,
even
about
your
own
immediate
feeling
 
much
harder
than
to
say
something
fine
about
them
which
be
not
the
exact
truth
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
for
this
rare
,
precious
quality
of
truthfulness
that
I
delight
in
many
dutch
painting
,
which
lofty
-
minded
people
despise
.
<EOS>
I
find
a
source
of
delicious
sympathy
in
these
faithful
picture
of
a
monotonous
homely
existence
,
which
have
be
the
fate
of
so
many
more
among
my
fellow
-
mortal
than
a
life
of
pomp
or
of
absolute
indigence
,
of
tragic
suffering
or
of
world
-
stir
action
.
<EOS>
I
turn
,
without
shrink
,
from
cloud
-
bear
angel
,
from
prophet
,
sibyls
,
and
heroic
warrior
,
to
an
old
woman
bend
over
her
flower
-
pot
,
or
eat
her
solitary
dinner
,
while
the
noonday
light
,
soften
perhaps
by
a
screen
of
leave
,
fall
on
her
mob
-
cap
,
and
just
touch
the
rim
of
her
spinning
-
wheel
,
and
her
stone
jug
,
and
all
those
cheap
common
thing
which
be
the
precious
necessary
of
life
to
her
 
<EOS>
or
I
turn
to
that
village
wedding
,
keep
between
four
brown
wall
,
where
an
awkward
bridegroom
open
the
dance
with
a
high
-
shouldered
,
broad
-
faced
bride
,
while
elderly
and
middle
-
aged
friend
look
on
,
with
very
irregular
nose
and
lip
,
and
probably
with
quart
-
pot
in
their
hand
,
<EOS>
but
with
an
expression
of
unmistakable
contentment
and
goodwill
.
<EOS>
"
Foh
!
"
say
my
idealistic
friend
,
"
what
vulgar
detail
!
<EOS>
what
good
be
there
in
take
all
these
pain
to
give
an
exact
likeness
of
old
woman
and
clown
?
<EOS>
what
a
low
phase
of
life
!
<EOS>
what
clumsy
,
ugly
people
!
"
  
<EOS>
but
bless
us
,
thing
may
be
lovable
that
be
not
altogether
handsome
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
I
be
not
at
all
sure
that
the
majority
of
the
human
race
have
not
be
ugly
,
and
even
among
those
"
lord
of
their
kind
,
"
the
british
,
squat
figure
,
ill
-
shapen
nostril
,
and
dingy
complexion
be
not
startle
exception
.
<EOS>
yet
there
be
a
great
deal
of
family
love
amongst
us
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
friend
or
two
whose
class
of
feature
be
such
that
the
Apollo
curl
on
the
summit
of
their
brow
would
be
decidedly
try
;
yet
to
my
certain
knowledge
tender
heart
have
beat
for
them
,
and
their
miniature
 
flattering
,
but
still
not
lovely
 
be
kiss
in
secret
by
motherly
lip
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
many
an
excellent
matron
,
who
could
have
never
in
her
good
day
have
be
handsome
,
and
yet
she
have
a
packet
of
yellow
love
-
letter
in
a
private
drawer
,
and
sweet
child
shower
kiss
on
her
sallow
cheek
.
<EOS>
and
I
believe
there
have
be
plenty
of
young
hero
,
of
middle
stature
and
feeble
beard
,
who
have
feel
quite
sure
they
could
never
love
anything
more
insignificant
than
a
Diana
,
and
yet
have
find
themselves
in
middle
life
happily
settle
with
a
wife
who
waddle
.
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
thank
God
;
human
feeling
be
like
the
mighty
river
that
bless
the
earth
:
it
do
not
wait
for
beauty
 
<EOS>
it
flow
with
resistless
force
and
bring
beauty
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
all
honour
and
reverence
to
the
divine
beauty
of
form
!
<EOS>
let
us
cultivate
it
to
the
utmost
in
man
,
woman
,
and
child
 
in
our
garden
and
in
our
house
.
<EOS>
but
let
us
love
that
other
beauty
too
,
which
lie
in
no
secret
of
proportion
,
but
in
the
secret
of
deep
human
sympathy
.
<EOS>
paint
us
an
angel
,
if
you
can
,
with
a
float
violet
robe
,
and
a
face
pale
by
the
celestial
light
;
paint
us
yet
oftener
a
Madonna
,
turn
her
mild
face
upward
and
open
her
arm
to
welcome
the
divine
glory
;
but
do
not
impose
on
us
any
aesthetic
rule
which
shall
banish
from
the
region
of
art
those
old
woman
scrape
carrot
with
their
work
-
wear
hand
,
those
heavy
clown
take
holiday
in
a
dingy
pot
-
house
,
those
rounded
back
and
stupid
weather
-
beat
face
that
have
bend
over
the
spade
and
do
the
rough
work
of
the
world
 
those
home
with
their
tin
pan
,
their
brown
pitcher
,
their
rough
cur
,
and
their
cluster
of
onion
.
<EOS>
in
this
world
there
be
so
many
of
these
common
coarse
people
,
who
have
no
picturesque
sentimental
wretchedness
!
<EOS>
It
be
so
needful
we
should
remember
their
existence
,
else
we
may
happen
to
leave
them
quite
out
of
our
religion
and
philosophy
and
frame
lofty
theory
which
only
fit
a
world
of
extreme
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
let
art
always
remind
us
of
them
;
therefore
let
us
always
have
man
ready
to
give
the
love
pain
of
a
life
to
the
faithful
representing
of
commonplace
thing
 
man
who
see
beauty
in
these
commonplace
thing
,
and
delight
in
show
how
kindly
the
light
of
heaven
fall
on
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
few
prophet
in
the
world
;
few
sublimely
beautiful
woman
;
few
hero
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
afford
to
give
all
my
love
and
reverence
to
such
rarity
:
I
want
a
great
deal
of
those
feeling
for
my
every
-
day
fellow
-
man
,
especially
for
the
few
in
the
foreground
of
the
great
multitude
,
whose
face
I
know
,
whose
hand
I
touch
,
for
whom
I
have
to
make
way
with
kindly
courtesy
.
<EOS>
neither
be
picturesque
lazzaroni
or
romantic
criminal
half
so
frequent
as
your
common
labourer
,
who
get
his
own
bread
and
eat
it
vulgarly
but
creditably
with
his
own
pocket
-
knife
.
<EOS>
It
be
more
needful
that
I
should
have
a
fibre
of
sympathy
connect
me
with
that
vulgar
citizen
who
weigh
out
my
sugar
in
a
vilely
assorted
cravat
and
waistcoat
,
than
with
the
handsome
rascal
in
red
scarf
and
green
feather
 
more
needful
that
my
heart
should
swell
with
love
admiration
at
some
trait
of
gentle
goodness
in
the
faulty
people
who
sit
at
the
same
hearth
with
me
,
or
in
the
clergyman
of
my
own
parish
,
who
be
perhaps
rather
too
corpulent
and
in
other
respect
be
not
an
Oberlin
or
a
Tillotson
,
than
at
the
deed
of
hero
whom
I
shall
never
know
except
by
hearsay
,
or
at
the
sublime
abstract
of
all
clerical
grace
that
be
ever
conceive
by
an
able
novelist
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
I
come
back
to
Mr.
Irwine
,
with
whom
I
desire
you
to
be
in
perfect
charity
,
far
as
he
may
be
from
satisfy
your
demand
on
the
clerical
character
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
think
he
be
not
 
as
he
ought
to
have
be
 
a
live
demonstration
of
the
benefit
attach
to
a
national
church
?
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
sure
of
that
;
at
least
I
know
that
the
people
in
Broxton
and
Hayslope
would
have
be
very
sorry
to
part
with
their
clergyman
,
and
that
most
face
brighten
at
his
approach
;
and
until
it
can
be
prove
that
hatred
be
a
well
thing
for
the
soul
than
love
,
I
must
believe
that
Mr.
Irwine
's
influence
in
his
parish
be
a
more
wholesome
one
than
that
of
the
zealous
Mr.
Ryde
,
who
come
there
twenty
year
afterwards
,
when
Mr.
Irwine
have
be
gather
to
his
father
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
Mr.
Ryde
insist
strongly
on
the
doctrine
of
the
Reformation
,
visit
his
flock
a
great
deal
in
their
own
home
,
and
be
severe
in
rebuke
the
aberration
of
the
flesh
 
<EOS>
put
a
stop
,
indeed
,
to
the
Christmas
round
of
the
church
singer
,
as
promote
drunkenness
and
too
light
a
handling
of
sacred
thing
.
<EOS>
but
I
gather
from
Adam
Bede
,
to
whom
I
talk
of
these
matter
in
his
old
age
,
that
few
clergyman
could
be
less
successful
in
win
the
heart
of
their
parishioner
than
Mr.
Ryde
.
<EOS>
They
learn
a
great
many
notion
about
doctrine
from
him
,
so
that
almost
every
church
-
goer
under
fifty
begin
to
distinguish
as
well
between
the
genuine
gospel
and
what
do
not
come
precisely
up
to
that
standard
,
as
if
he
have
be
bear
and
breed
a
Dissenter
;
and
for
some
time
after
his
arrival
there
seem
to
be
quite
a
religious
movement
in
that
quiet
rural
district
.
"
<EOS>
but
,
"
say
Adam
,
"
I
have
see
pretty
clear
,
ever
since
I
be
a
young
un
,
as
religion
's
something
else
besides
notion
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
notion
set
people
do
the
right
thing
 
<EOS>
it
be
feeling
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
same
with
the
notion
in
religion
as
it
be
with
math'matics
 
<EOS>
a
man
may
be
able
to
work
problem
straight
off
in
's
head
as
he
sit
by
the
fire
and
smoke
his
pipe
,
but
if
he
have
to
make
a
machine
or
a
building
,
he
must
have
a
will
and
a
resolution
and
love
something
else
well
than
his
own
ease
.
<EOS>
somehow
,
the
congregation
begin
to
fall
off
,
and
people
begin
to
speak
light
o
'
Mr.
Ryde
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
mean
right
at
bottom
;
but
,
you
see
,
he
be
sourish
-
tempered
,
and
be
for
beat
down
price
with
the
people
as
work
for
him
;
and
his
preaching
would
not
go
down
well
with
that
sauce
.
<EOS>
and
he
want
to
be
like
my
lord
judge
<EOS>
i
'
the
parish
,
punish
folk
for
do
wrong
;
and
he
scold
'em
from
the
pulpit
as
if
he
would
be
a
Ranter
,
and
yet
he
could
not
abide
the
Dissenters
,
and
be
a
deal
more
set
against
'em
than
Mr.
Irwine
be
.
<EOS>
and
then
he
do
not
keep
within
his
income
,
for
he
seem
to
think
at
first
go
-
off
that
six
hundred
a
-
year
be
to
make
him
as
big
a
man
as
Mr.
Donnithorne
.
<EOS>
that
be
a
sore
mischief
I
have
often
see
with
the
poor
curate
jump
into
a
bit
of
a
live
all
of
a
sudden
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Ryde
be
a
deal
think
on
at
a
distance
,
I
believe
,
and
he
write
book
,
but
as
for
math'matics
and
the
natur
o
'
thing
,
he
be
as
ignorant
as
a
woman
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
know
about
doctrine
,
and
use
to
call
'em
the
bulwark
of
the
Reformation
;
but
I
have
always
mistrust
that
sort
o
'
learning
as
leave
folk
foolish
and
unreasonable
about
business
.
<EOS>
now
Mester
Irwine
be
as
different
as
could
be
:
as
quick
!
 
<EOS>
he
understand
what
you
mean
in
a
minute
,
and
he
know
all
about
building
,
and
could
see
when
you
would
make
a
good

<EOS>
and
he
behave
as
much
like
a
gentleman
to
the
farmer
,
and
th
'
old
woman
,
and
the
labourer
,
as
he
do
to
the
gentry

You
never

him
interfere

play
th

<EOS>
ah

he
be
a
fine
man
as
ever
you
set
eye
on
;
and
so
kind
to
's
mother

<EOS>
that
poor
sickly
Miss
Anne
 
<EOS>
he
seem
to
think
more
of

<EOS>
there
be
not
a

in

a
word
to
say
against
him

and
his

stay
with
him
till
they
be
so
old

he

to

other

<EOS>
"
well

I
say
,

that
be
an
excellent
way
of
preaching
in

I

,
if
your
old
friend
Mr.
Irwine
be
to
come
to
life
again
,
and
get
into
the
pulpit
next
Sunday

you
would
be

well

him

"
Nay

broaden
his

all

nobody
have
ever
hear
me
say
Mr.

be
much
of
a
preacher
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
go
into
deep
speritial
experience
;
and
I
know
there
s
a
deal
in
a
man
's
inward
life
as
you
can
not
measure
by
the
square
,
and
say
,
"
do
this
and
that
will
follow
,
"
and
,
"
do
that
and
this
will
follow

<EOS>
"
there
be
thing
go
on
in
the
soul
,
and
time
when
feeling
come
into
you
like
a
rushing
mighty
wind
,
as
the
scripture
say
,
and
part
your
life
in
two
a'most
,
so
you
look
back
on
yourself
as
if
you
be
somebody
else

those
be
thing
as
you
can
not
bottle
up
in
a

do

and
I
will
go
so
far
with
the
strong
Methodist
ever
you
will
find

<EOS>
that
show
me
there
be
deep
speritial
thing
in
religion

<EOS>
You
can
not
make
much
out
wi

talk
about
it

but
you
feel
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
do
not
go
into
those
thing
 
<EOS>
he
preach
short
moral
sermon
,
and
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
but
then
he
act
pretty
much
up
to
what
he
say
;
he
do
not
set
up
for
be
so
different
from
other
folk
one
day
,
and
then
be
as
like
'em
as
two
pea
the
next
.
<EOS>
and
he
make
folk
love
him
and
respect
him
,

that
be
well
nor

up

Mrs.
Poyser
use
to
say
 
you
know
she
would
have
her
word
about
everything
 
<EOS>
she
say
,
Mr.

be
like
a
good
meal
o

victual
<EOS>
,
you
be
the
well
for
him
without
think
on
it
,
and
Mr.

be
like
a
dose
o
'
physic
,
he
grip
you
and
worrete
you
,
and
after
all
he
leave
you
much
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
do
not
Mr.
Ryde
preach
a
great
deal
more
about
that
spiritual
part
of
religion
that
you
talk
of
,
Adam
?
<EOS>
Could
not
you
get
more
out
of
his
sermon
than
out
of
Mr.
Irwine
's
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
eh
,
I
knowna
.
<EOS>
He
preach
a
deal
about
doctrine
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
see
pretty
clear
,
ever
since
I
be
a
young
un
,
as
religion
's
something
else
besides
doctrine
and
notion
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
it
as
if
the
doctrine
be
like
find
name
for
your
feeling
,
so
as
you
can
talk
of
'em
when
you
have
never
know
'em
,
just
as
a
man
may
talk
o
'
tool
when
he
know
their
name
,
though
he
be
never
so
much
as
see
'em
,
still
less
handle
'em
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
a
deal
o
'
doctrine
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
my
time
,
for
I
use
to
go
after
the
Dissenting
preacher
along
wi
'
Seth
,
when
I
be
a
lad
o
'
seventeen
,
and
get
puzzle
myself
a
deal
about
th
'
Arminians
and
the
Calvinists
.
<EOS>
the
Wesleyans
,
you
know
,
be
strong
Arminians
;
and
Seth
,
who
could
never
abide
anything
harsh
and
be
always
for
hope
the
good
,
hold
fast
by
the
Wesleyans
from
the
very
first
;
but
I
think
I
could
pick
a
hole
or
two
in
their
notion
,
and
I
get
dispute
wi
'
one
o
'
the
class
leader
down
at
Treddles'on
,
and
harass
him
so
,
first
o
'
<EOS>
this
side
<EOS>
and
then
o
'
that
,
till
at
last
he
say
,
"
young
man
,
it
be
the
devil
make
use
o
'
your
pride
and
conceit
as
a
weapon
to
war
against
the
simplicity
o
'
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
help
laugh
then
,
but
as
I
be
go
home
,
I
think
the
man
be
not
far
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
see
as
all
this
weigh
and
sift
what
this
text
mean
and
that
text
mean
,
and
whether
folk
be
save
all
by
God
's
grace
,
or
whether
there
go
an
ounce
o
'
their
own
will
to't
,
be
no
part
o
'
real
religion
at
all
.
<EOS>
You
may
talk
o
'
these
thing
for
hour
on
end
,
and
you
will
only
be
all
the
more
coxy
and
conceited
for't
.
<EOS>
so
I
take
to
go
nowhere
but
to
church
,
and
hear
nobody
but
Mr.
Irwine
,
for
he
say
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
be
good
and
what
you
would
be
the
wise
for
remember
.
<EOS>
and
I
find
it
better
for
my
soul
to
be
humble
before
the
mystery
<EOS>
o
'
God
's
dealing
,
and
not
be
make
a
clatter
about
what
I
could
never
understand
.
<EOS>
and
they
be
poor
foolish
question
after
all
;
for
what
have
we
get
either
inside
or
outside
of
us
but
what
come
from
God
?
<EOS>
if
we
have
get
a
resolution
to
do
right
,
He
give
it
us
,
I
reckon
,
first
or
last
;
but
<EOS>
I
see
plain
enough
we
shall
never
do
it
without
a
resolution
,
and
that
be
enough
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
,
you
perceive
,
be
a
warm
admirer
,
perhaps
a
partial
judge
,
of
Mr.
Irwine
,
as
,
happily
,
some
of
us
still
be
of
the
people
we
have
know
familiarly
.
<EOS>
doubtless
it
will
be
despise
as
a
weakness
by
that
lofty
order
of
mind
who
pant
after
the
ideal
,
and
be
oppress
by
a
general
sense
that
their
emotion
be
of
too
exquisite
a
character
to
find
fit
object
among
their
everyday
fellowman
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
be
favour
with
the
confidence
of
these
select
nature
,
and
find
them
to
concur
in
the
experience
that
great
man
be
overestimate
and
small
man
be
insupportable
;
that
if
you
would
love
a
woman
without
ever
look
back
on
your
love
as
a
folly
,
she
must
die
while
you
be
court
her
;
and
if
you
would
maintain
the
slight
belief
in
human
heroism
,
you
must
never
make
a
pilgrimage
to
see
the
hero
.
<EOS>
I
confess
I
have
often
meanly
shrink
from
confess
to
these
accomplished
and
acute
gentleman
what
my
own
experience
have
be
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
I
have
often
smile
with
hypocritical
assent
,
and
gratify
them
with
an
epigram
on
the
fleeting
nature
of
our
illusion
,
which
any
one
moderately
acquaint
with
french
literature
can
command
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
<EOS>
human
converse
,
I
think
some
wise
man
have
remark
,
be
not
rigidly
sincere
.
<EOS>
but
I
herewith
discharge
my
conscience
,
and
declare
that
I
have
have
quite
enthusiastic
movement
of
admiration
towards
old
gentleman
who
speak
the
bad
English
,
who
be
occasionally
fretful
in
their
temper
,
and
who
have
never
move
in
a
high
sphere
of
influence
than
that
of
parish
overseer
;
and
that
the
way
in
which
I
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
human
nature
be
lovable
 
the
way
I
have
learn
something
of
its
deep
pathos
,
its
sublime
mystery
 
have
be
by
live
a
great
deal
among
people
more
or
less
commonplace
and
vulgar
,
of
whom
you
would
perhaps
hear
nothing
very
surprising
if
you
be
to
inquire
about
them
in
the
neighbourhood
where
they
dwelt
.
<EOS>
ten
to
one
most
of
the
small
shopkeeper
in
their
vicinity
see
nothing
at
all
in
them
.
<EOS>
for
I
have
observe
this
remarkable
coincidence
,
that
the
select
nature
who
pant
after
the
ideal
,
and
find
nothing
in
pantaloon
or
petticoat
great
enough
to
command
their
reverence
and
love
,
be
curiously
in
unison
with
the
narrow
and
petty
.
<EOS>
for
example
,
I
have
often
hear
Mr.
Gedge
,
the
landlord
of
the
Royal
Oak
,
who
use
to
turn
a
bloodshot
eye
on
his
neighbour
in
the
village
of
Shepperton
,
sum
up
his
opinion
of
the
people
in
his
own
parish
 
and
they
be
all
the
people
he
know
 
in
these
emphatic
word
:
"
<EOS>
aye
,
sir
,
I
have
say
it
often
,
and
I
will
say
it
again
<EOS>
,
they
be
a
poor
lot
<EOS>
i
'
this
parish
 
<EOS>
a
poor
lot
,
sir
,
big
and
little
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
think
he
have
a
dim
idea
that
if
he
could
migrate
to
a
distant
parish
,
he
may
find
neighbour
worthy
of
him
;
and
indeed
he
do
subsequently
transfer
himself
to
the
Saracen
's
Head
,
which
be
do
a
thriving
business
in
the
back
street
of
a
neighbour
market

town
.
<EOS>
but
,
oddly
enough
,
he
have
find
the
people
up
that
back
street
of
precisely
the
same
stamp
as
the
inhabitant
of
Shepperton
 
"
a

big

them

I
would

<EOS>
Hetty
be
come
downstairs

Mrs.

in

plain

,
be
stand
below

<EOS>
if
ever
a

look

have
be
make
of

that

be
Hetty
in

for
her
hat
be
trim
with
pink

and
her
frock
have
pink
spot
,
sprinkle
on
a
white
ground

<EOS>
there
be
nothing
but
pink
and
white
about
her
,
except
in
her
dark
hair
and
eye
and
her
little
buckled
shoe
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
be
provoke
at
herself
,
for
she
could
hardly
keep
from
smile
,
as
any
mortal
be
incline
to
do
at
the
sight
of

round
thing

<EOS>
so
she
turn
without
speak
,
and
join
the
group
outside

follow
by
Hetty

whose

be
flutter
so
at
the
thought

she
expect

she
hardly
feel

tread
on

and
now
the
little
procession
set
off

<EOS>
Mr.

be
in
his

of
drab

with
a

and
a
green

have
a
large

excellent
grey
ribbed
stocking
,
knit
by
Mrs.

's
own
hand
,
set
off
the
proportion
of
his
leg
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
have
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
his
leg
,
and
suspect
that
the
grow
abuse
of
top
-
boot
and
other
fashion
tend
to
disguise
the
nether
limb
have
their
origin
in
a

<EOS>
still
less
have
he

be
good

itself
as
he
say
,
"
come

<EOS>
and
give
his

to
his

lead
the

the

where
Molly

<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Poyser
be
now
at
the
end
of
the
second
field
,
so
they
set
Totty
on
the
top
of
one
of
the
large
stone
form
the
true
Loamshire
stile
,
and
await
the
loiterer

observe
with
complacency
,
"
Dey

"
  
<EOS>
the
fact
be
that
this
Sunday
walk
through
the
field
be
fraught
with
great
excitement
to
Marty
and
Tommy
,
who
see
a
perpetual
drama
go
on
in
the
hedgerow
,
and
could
no
more
refrain
from
stop
and
peep
than
if
they
have
be
a
couple
of
spaniel
or
terrier
.
<EOS>
Marty
be
quite
sure
he
see
a
yellow
-
hammer
on
the
bough
of
the
great
ash
,
and
while
he
be
peep
,
he
miss
the
sight
of
a
white
-
throated
stoat
,
which
have
run
across
the
path
and
be
describe
with
much
fervour
by
the
junior
Tommy
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
a
little
greenfinch
,
just
fledge
,
flutter
along
the
ground
,
and
it
seem
quite
possible
to
catch
it
,
till
it
manage
to
flutter
under
the
blackberry
bush
.
<EOS>
Hetty
could
not
be
get
to
give
any
heed
to
these
thing
,
so
Molly
be
call
on
for
her
ready
sympathy
,
and
peep
with
open
mouth
wherever
she
be
tell
,
and
say
"
Lawks
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
whenever
she
be
expect
to
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
Molly
hasten
on
with
some
alarm
when
Hetty
have
come
back
and
call
to
them
that
her
aunt
be
angry
;
but
Marty
run
on
first
,
shout
,
"
We
have
find
the
speckled
turkey

nest
,
Mother

"
<EOS>
with
the
instinctive
confidence
that
people
who
bring
good
news
be
never
in
fault

<EOS>
"
ah

say
Mrs.

<EOS>
the
father

exchange
a

of
amusement
at

through

on
without

notwithstanding
a
small

full

wistfully

<EOS>
the
damp
hay

must

scatter

turn
afresh
to

morrow
be
not
a
cheer
sight
to
Mr.
Poyser
,
who
during
hay
and
corn
harvest
have
often
some
mental
struggle
as
to
the
benefit
of
a
day
of
rest
;
but
no
temptation
would
have
induce
him
to
carry
on
any
field
-
work
,
however
early
in
the
morning
,
on
a
Sunday
;
for
have
not
Michael
Holdsworth
have
a
pair
of
oxen
"
swelter
"
while
he
be
plough
on
Good
Friday
?
<EOS>
that
be
a
demonstration
that
work
on
sacred
day

a
wicked
thing
;
and
with
wickedness
of
any
sort
Martin
Poyser
be
quite
clear
that
he
would
have
nothing

since
money
get
by
such

It

but
it
be
poor
foolishness
to

<EOS>
there
be
that
Jim

use
to
do
the

the
excellent
habit

Mrs.

clock
have
of
take
time
by
the
forelock
have
secure
their
arrival
at
the
village
while
it
be
still
a
quarter
to
two

though
almost
every
one
who
mean
to
go
to
church
be
already
within
the
churchyard
gate

<EOS>
those
who
stay
at

stand
at

door
nurse
her
baby

feeling
as
woman
feel
in
that
position
 
that
nothing
else
can
be

<EOS>
It
be
not
entirely
to
see
Thias
Bede
's
funeral
that
the
people
be
stand
about
the
churchyard
so
long
before
service
begin
;
that
be
their
common
practice
.
<EOS>
the
woman
,
indeed
,
usually
enter
the
church
at
once
,
and
the
farmer
'
wife
talk
in
an
undertone
to
each
other
,
over
the
tall
pew
,
about
their
illness
and
the
total
failure
of

and
other

make
specific
,
as
far
preferable
 
about
the
servant
,
and
their
grow
exorbitance
as
to
wage
,
whereas
the
quality
of
their
service
decline
from
year
to
year
,
and
there
be
no
girl
nowadays
to
be
trust
any
further
than
you
could
see
her
 
about
the
bad
price
<EOS>
Mr.
Dingall
,
the
Treddleston
grocer
,
be
give
for
butter
,
and
the
reasonable
doubt
that
may
be
hold
as
to
his
solvency
,
notwithstanding
that
Mrs.
Dingall
be
a
sensible
woman
,
and
they
be
all
sorry
for
HER
,
for
she
have
very
good
kin

<EOS>
meantime
the

linger
outside

hardly
any
of
them
except
the
singer

who
have
a
humming
and
fragmentary
rehearsal
to
go
through
,
enter
the
church
until
Mr.
Irwine
be
in
the
desk
.
<EOS>
They
see
no
reason
for
that
premature
entrance
 
<EOS>
what
could
they
do
in
church
if
they
be
there
before
service
begin

<EOS>

they
do
not
conceive
that
any
power
in

could
take
it
ill

Chad
Cranage
look
like
quite
a
new
acquaintance
to
-
day
,
for
he
have
get
his
clean
Sunday
face
,
which
always
make
his
little
granddaughter
cry
at
him
as
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
but
an
experienced
eye
would
have
fix
on
him
at
once
as
the
village
blacksmith
,
after
see
the
humble
deference
with
which
the
big
saucy
fellow
take
off
his
hat
and
stroke
his
hair
to
the
farmer
;
for
Chad
be
accustom
to
say
that
a
working
-
man
must
hold
a
candle
to
a
personage
understand
to
be
as
black
as
he
be
himself
on
weekday
;
by
which
evil
-
sound
rule
of
conduct
he
mean
what
be
,
after
all
,
rather
virtuous
than
otherwise
,
namely
,
that
man
who
have
horse
to
be
shod
must
be
treat
with
respect

<EOS>
Chad
and
the
rough
sort
of
workman
keep
aloof
from
the
grave
under
the
white
thorn
,
where
the
burial
be
go
forward
;
but
Sandy
Jim
,
and
several
of
the
farm
-
labourer
,
make
a
group
round
it
,
and
stand
with
their
hat
off
,
as
fellow
-
mourner
with
the
mother
and
son
.
<EOS>
other
hold
a
midway
position
,
sometimes
watch
the
group
at
the
grave
,
sometimes
listen
to
the
conversation
of
the
farmer
,
who
stand
in
a
knot
near
the
church
door
,
and
be
now
join
by
Martin
Poyser
,
while
his
family
pass
into
the
church
.
<EOS>
on
the
outside
of
this
knot
stand
Mr.
Casson
,
the
landlord
of
the
Donnithorne
Arms
,
in
his
most
striking
attitude
 
that
be
to
say
,
with
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
thrust
between
the
button
of
his
waistcoat
,
his
left
hand
in
his
breech
pocket
,
and
his
head
very
much
on
one
side
;
look
,
on
the
whole
,
like
an
actor
who
have
only
a
mono
-
syllabic
part
entrust
to
him
,
but
feel
sure
that
the
audience
discern
his
fitness
for
the
lead
business
;
curiously
in
contrast
with
old
Jonathan
Burge
,
who
hold
his
hand
behind
him
and
lean
forward
,
cough
asthmatically
,
with
an
inward
scorn
of
all
knowingness
that
could
not
be
turn
into
cash
.
<EOS>
the
talk
be
in
rather
a
low
tone
than
usual
to
-
day
,
hush
a
little
by
the
sound
of
Mr.
Irwine
's
voice
read
the
final
prayer
of
the
burial
-
service
.
<EOS>
They
have
all
have
their
word
of
pity
for
poor
Thias
,
but
now
they
have
get
upon
the
nearer
subject
of
their
own
grievance
against
Satchell
,
the
Squire
's
bailiff
,
who
play
the
part
of
steward
so
far
as
it
be
not
perform
by
old
Mr.
Donnithorne
himself
,
for
that
gentleman
<EOS>
have
the
meanness
to
receive
his
own
rent
and
make
bargain
about
his
own
timber
.
<EOS>
this
subject
of
conversation
be
an
additional
reason
for
not
be
loud
,
since
Satchell
himself
may
presently
be
walk
up
the
paved
road
to
the
church
door
.
<EOS>
and
soon
they
become
suddenly
silent
;
for
Mr.
Irwine
's
voice
have
cease
,
and
the
group
round
the
white
thorn
be
disperse
itself
towards
the
church
.
  
<EOS>
They
all
move
aside
,
and
stand
with
their
hat
off
,
while
Mr.
Irwine
pass
.
<EOS>
Adam
and
Seth
be
come
next
,
with
their
mother
between
them
;
for
Joshua
Rann
officiate
as
head
sexton
as
well
as
clerk
,
and
be
not
yet
ready
to
follow
the
rector
into
the
vestry
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
pause
before
the
three
mourner
come
on
<EOS>
:
Lisbeth
have
turn
round
to
look
again
towards
the
grave
!
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
now
but
the
brown
earth
under
the
white
thorn
.
<EOS>
yet
she
cry
less
to
-
day
than
she
have
do
any
day
since
her
husband
's
death
.
<EOS>
along
with
all
her
grief
there
be
mix
an
unusual
sense
of
her
own
importance
in
have
a
"
burial
,
"
and
in
Mr.
Irwine
's
read
a
special
service
for
her
husband
;
and
besides
,
she
know
the
funeral
psalm
be
go
to
be
sing
for
him
.
<EOS>
She
feel
this
counter
-
excitement
to
her
sorrow
still
more
strongly
as
she
walk
with
her
son
towards
the
church
door
,
and
see
the
friendly
sympathetic
nod
of
their
fellow
-
parishioner
.
  
<EOS>
the
mother
and
son
pass
into
the
church
,
and
one
by
one
the
loiterer
follow
,
though
some
still
linger
without
;
the
sight
of
Mr.
Donnithorne
's
carriage
,
which
be
wind
slowly
up
the
hill
,
perhaps
help
to
make
them
feel
that
there
be
no
need
for
haste
.
  
<EOS>
but
presently
the
sound
of
the
bassoon
and
the
key
-
bugle
burst
forth
;
the
evening
hymn
,
which
always
open
the
service
,
have
begin
,
and
every
one
must
now
enter
and
take
his
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
the
interior
of
Hayslope
Church
be
remarkable
for
anything
except
for
the
grey
age
of
its
oaken
pew
 
great
square
pew
mostly
,
<EOS>
range
on
each
side
of
a
narrow
aisle
.
<EOS>
It
be
free
,
indeed
,
from
the
modern
blemish
of
gallery
.
<EOS>
the
choir
have
two
narrow
pew
to
themselves
in
the
middle
of
the
right
-
hand
row
,
so
that
it
be
a
short
process
for
Joshua
Rann
to
take
his
place
among
them
as
principal
bass
,
and
return
to
his
desk
after
the
singing
be
over
.
<EOS>
the
pulpit
and
desk
,
grey
and
old
as
the
pew
,
stand
on
one
side
of
the
arch
lead
into
the
chancel
,
which
also
have
its
grey
square
pew
for
Mr.
Donnithorne
's
family
and
servant
.
<EOS>
yet
I
assure
you
these
grey
pew
,
with
the
buff
-
washed
wall
,
give
a
very
pleasing
tone
to
this
shabby
interior
,
and
agree
extremely
well
with
the
ruddy
face
and
bright
waistcoat
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
liberal
touch
of
crimson
toward
the
chancel
,
for
the
pulpit
and
Mr.
Donnithorne
's
own
pew
have
handsome
crimson
cloth
cushion
;
and
,
to
close
the
vista
,
there
be
a
crimson
altar
-
cloth
,
embroider
with
golden
ray
by
Miss
Lydia
's
own
hand
.
  
<EOS>
but
even
without
the
crimson
cloth
,
the
effect
must
have
be
warm
and
cheer
when
Mr.
Irwine
be
in
the
desk
,
look
benignly
round
on
that
simple
congregation
 
on
the
hardy
old
man
,
with
bent
knee
and
shoulder
,
perhaps
,
but
with
vigour
leave
for
much
hedge
-
clip
and
thatch
;
on
the
tall
stalwart
frame
and
roughly
cut
bronze
face
of
the
stone
-
cutter
and
carpenter
;
on
the
half
-
dozen
well
-
to
-
do
farmer
,
with
their
apple
-
cheek
family
;
and
on
the
clean
old
woman
,
mostly
farm
-
labourer
'
wife
,
with
their
bit
of
snow
-
white
cap
-
border
under
their
black
bonnet
,
and
with
their
wither
arm
,
bare
from
the
elbow
,
fold
passively
over
their
chest
.
<EOS>
for
none
of
the
old
people
hold
book
 
<EOS>
why
should
they
?
<EOS>
not
one
of
them
could
read
.
<EOS>
but
they
know
a
few
"
good
word
"
by
heart
,
and
their
wither
lip
now
and
then
move
silently
,
follow
the
service
without
any
very
clear
comprehension
indeed
,
but
with
a
simple
faith
in
its
efficacy
to
ward
off
harm
and
bring
blessing
.
<EOS>
and
now
all
face
be
visible
,
for
all
be
stand
up
 
the
little
child
on
the
seat
peep
over
the
edge
of
the
grey
pew
,
while
good
Bishop
Ken
's
evening
hymn
be
be
sing
to
one
of
those
lively
psalm
-
tune
which
die
out
with
the
last
generation
of
rector
and
choral
parish
clerk
.
<EOS>
melody
die
out
,
like
the
pipe
of
Pan
,
with
the
ear
that
love
them
and
listen
for
them
.
<EOS>
Adam
be
not
in
his
usual
place
among
the
singer
to
-
day
,
for
he
sit
with
his
mother
and
Seth
,
and
he
notice
with
surprise
that
Bartle
Massey
be
absent
too
 
all
the
more
agreeable
for
Mr.
Joshua
Rann
,
who
give
out
his
bass
note
with
unusual
complacency
and
throw
an
extra
ray
of
severity
into
the
glance
he
send
over
his
spectacle
at
the
recusant
Will
Maskery
.
  
<EOS>
I
beseech
you
to
imagine
Mr.
Irwine
look
round
on
this
scene
,
in
his
ample
white
surplice
that
become
him
so
well
,
with
his
powdered
hair
throw
back
,
his
rich
brown
complexion
,
and
his
finely
cut
nostril
and
upper
lip
;
for
there
be
a
certain
virtue
in
that
benignant
yet
keen
countenance
as
there
be
in
all
human
face
from
which
a
generous
soul
beam
out
.
<EOS>
and
over
all
stream
the
delicious
June
sunshine
through
the
old
window
,
with
their
desultory
patch
of
yellow
,
red
,
and
blue
,
that
throw
pleasant
touch
of
colour
on
the
opposite
wall
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
,
as
Mr.
Irwine
look
round
to
-
day
,
his
eye
rest
an
instant
longer
than
usual
on
the
square
pew
occupy
by
Martin
Poyser
and
his
family
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
another
pair
of
dark
eye
that
find
it
impossible
not
to
wander
thither
,
and
rest
on
that
round
pink
-
and
-
white
figure
.
<EOS>
but
Hetty
be
at
that
moment
quite
careless
of
any
glance
 
she
be
absorb
in
the
thought
that
Arthur
Donnithorne
would
soon
be
come
into
church
,
for
the
carriage
<EOS>
must
surely
be
at
the
church
-
gate
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
see
him
since
she
part
with
him
in
the
wood
on
Thursday
evening
,
and
oh
,
how
long
the
time
have
seem
!
<EOS>
thing
have
go
on
just
the
same
as
ever
since
that
evening
;
the
wonder
that
have
happen
then
have
bring
no
change
after
them
;
they
be
already
like
a
dream
.
<EOS>
when
she
hear
the
church
door
swinge
,
her
heart
beat
so
<EOS>
,
she
dare
not
look
up
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
her
aunt
be
curtsy
;
she
curtsy
herself
.
<EOS>
that
must
be
old
Mr.
Donnithorne
 
<EOS>
he
always
come
first
,
the
wrinkle
small
old
man
,
peer
round
with
short
-
sight
glance
at
the
bow
and
curtsy
congregation
;
then
she
know
Miss
Lydia
be
pass
,
and
though
Hetty
like
so
much
to
look
at
her
fashionable
little
coal
-
scuttle
bonnet
,
with
the
wreath
of
small
rose
round
it
,
she
do
not
mind
it
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
more
curtsy
 
<EOS>
no
,
he
be
not
come
;
she
feel
sure
there
be
nothing
else
pass
the
pew
door
but
the
house
-
keeper
's
black
bonnet
and
the
lady
's
maid
's
beautiful
straw
hat
that
have
once
be
Miss
Lydia
's
,
and
then
the
powdered
head
of
the
butler
and
footman
.
<EOS>
no
,
he
be
not
there
;
yet
she
would
look
now
 
<EOS>
she
may
be
mistake
 
for
,
after
all
,
she
have
not
look
.
<EOS>
so
she
lift
up
her
eyelid
and
glance
timidly
at
the
cushioned
pew
in
the
chancel
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
one
but
old
Mr.
Donnithorne
rub
his
spectacle
with
his
white
handkerchief
,
and
Miss
Lydia
open
the
large
gilt
-
edge
prayer
-
book
.
<EOS>
the
chill
disappointment
be
too
hard
to
bear
.
<EOS>
She
feel
herself
turn
pale
,
her
lip
tremble
;
she
be
ready
to
cry
.
<EOS>
oh
,
what
SHOULD
she
do
?
<EOS>
everybody
would
know
the
reason
;
they
would
know
she
be
cry
because
Arthur
be
not
there
.
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Craig
,
with
the
wonderful
hothouse
plant
in
his
button
-
hole
,
be
stare
at
her
,
she
know
.
<EOS>
It
be
dreadfully
long
before
the
General
Confession
begin
,
so
that
she
could
kneel
down
.
<EOS>
two
great
drop
WOULD
fall
then
,
but
no
one
see
them
except
good
-
natured
Molly
,
for
her
aunt
and
uncle
knelt
with
their
back
towards
her
.
<EOS>
molly
,
unable
to
imagine
any
cause
for
tear
in
church
except
faintness
,
of
which
she
have
a
vague
traditional
knowledge
,
draw
out
of
her
pocket
a
queer
little
flat
blue
smelling
-
bottle
,
and
after
much
labour
in
pull
the
cork
out
,
thrust
the
narrow
neck
against
Hetty
's
nostril
.
<EOS>
"
It
donna
smell
,
"
she
whisper
,
think
this
be
a
great
advantage
which
old
salt
have
over
fresh
one
:
they
do
you
good
without
bite
your
nose
.
<EOS>
Hetty
push
it
away
peevishly
;
but
this
little
flash
of
temper
do
what
the
salt
could
not
have
do
 
<EOS>
it
rouse
her
to
wipe
away
the
trace
of
her
tear
,
and
try
with
all
her
may
not
to
shed
any
more
.
<EOS>
Hetty
have
a
certain
strength
in
her
vain
little
nature
:
she
would
have
bear
anything
rather
than
be
laugh
at
,
or
point
at
with
any
other
feeling
than
admiration
;
she
would
have
press
her
own
nail
into
her
tender
flesh
rather
than
<EOS>
people
should
know
a
secret
she
do
not
want
them
to
know
.
  
<EOS>
what
fluctuation
there
be
in
her
busy
thought
and
feeling
,
while
Mr.
Irwine
be
pronounce
the
solemn
"
absolution
"
in
her
deaf
ear
,
and
through
all
the
tone
of
petition
that
follow
!
<EOS>
anger
lie
very
close
to
disappointment
,
and
soon
win
the
victory
over
the
conjecture
her
small
ingenuity
could
devise
to
account
for
Arthur
's
absence
on
the
supposition
that
he
really
want
to
come
,
really
want
to
see
her
again
.
<EOS>
and
by
the
time
she
rise
from
her
knee
mechanically
,
because
all
the
rest
be
rise
,
the
colour
have
return
to
her
cheek
even
with
a
heighten
glow
,
for
she
be
frame
little
indignant
speech
to
herself
,
say
she
hate
Arthur
for
give
her
this
pain
 
she
would
like
him
to
suffer
too
.
<EOS>
yet
while
this
selfish
tumult
be
go
on
in
her
soul
,
her
eye
be
bent
down
on
her
prayer
-
book
,
and
the
eyelid
with
their
dark
fringe
look
as
lovely
as
ever
.
<EOS>
Adam
Bede
think
so
,
as
he
glance
at
her
for
a
moment
on
rise
from
his
knee
.
  
<EOS>
but
Adam
's
thought
of
Hetty
do
not
deafen
him
to
the
service
;
they
rather
blend
with
all
the
other
deep
feeling
for
which
the
church
service
be
a
channel
to
him
this
afternoon
,
as
a
certain
consciousness
of
our
entire
past
and
our
imagine
future
blend
itself
with
all
our
moment
of
keen
sensibility
.
<EOS>
and
to
Adam
the
church
service
be
the
good
channel
he
could
have
find
for
his
mingle
regret
,
yearning
,
and
resignation
;
its
interchange
of
beseech
cry
for
help
with
outburst
of
faith
and
praise
,
its
recurrent
response
and
the
familiar
rhythm
of
its
collect
,
seem
to
speak
for
him
as
no
other
form
of
worship
could
have
do
;
as
,
to
those
early
Christians
who
have
worship
from
their
childhood
upward
in
catacombs
,
the
torch
-
light
and
shadow
must
have
seem
nearer
the
Divine
presence
than
the
heathenish
daylight
of
the
street
.
<EOS>
the
secret
of
our
emotion
never
lie
in
the
bare
object
,
but
in
its
subtle
relation
to
our
own
past
:
no
wonder
the
secret
escape
the
unsympathizing
observer
,
who
may
as
well
put
on
his
spectacle
to
discern
odour
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
one
reason
why
even
a
chance
comer
would
have
find
the
service
in
Hayslope
Church
more
impressive
than
in
most
other
village
nook
in
the
kingdom
 
<EOS>
a
reason
of
which
I
be
sure
you
have
not
the
slight
suspicion
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
reading
of
our
friend
Joshua
Rann
.
<EOS>
where
that
good
shoemaker
get
his
notion
of
read
from
remain
a
mystery
even
to
his
most
intimate
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
I
believe
,
after
all
,
he
get
it
chiefly
from
Nature
,
who
have
pour
some
of
her
music
into
this
honest
conceited
soul
,
as
she
have
be
know
to
do
into
other
narrow
soul
before
his
.
<EOS>
She
have
give
him
,
at
least
,
a
fine
bass
voice
and
a
musical
ear
;
but
I
can
not
positively
say
whether
these
alone
have
suffice
to
inspire
him
with
the
rich
chant
in
which
he
deliver
the
response
.
<EOS>
the
way
he
roll
from
a
rich
deep
forte
into
a
melancholy
cadence
,
subsiding
,
at
the
end
of
the
last
word
,
into
a
sort
of
faint
resonance
,
like
the
linger
vibration
of
a
fine
violoncello
,
I
can
compare
to
nothing
for
its
strong
calm
melancholy
but
the
rush
and
cadence
of
the
wind
among
the
autumn
bough
.
<EOS>
this
may
seem
a
strange
mode
of
speak
about
the
reading
of
a
parish
clerk
 
a
man
in
rusty
spectacle
,
with
stubbly
hair
,
a
large
occiput
,
and
a
prominent
crown
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
Nature
's
way
:
she
will
allow
a
gentleman
of
splendid
physiognomy
and
poetic
aspiration
to
sing
woefully
out
of
tune
,
and
not
give
him
the
slight
hint
of
it
;
and
take
care
that
some
narrow
-
browe
fellow
,
troll
a
ballad
in
the
corner
of
a
pot
-
house
,
shall
be
as
true
to
his
interval
as
a
bird
.
  
<EOS>
Joshua
himself
be
less
proud
of
his
reading
than
of
his
singing
,
and
it
be
always
with
a
sense
of
heighten
importance
that
he
pass
from
the
desk
to
the
choir
.
<EOS>
still
more
to
-
day
:
it
be
a
special
occasion
,
for
an
old
man
,
familiar
to
all
the
parish
,
have
die
a
sad
death
 
not
in
his
bed
,
a
circumstance
the
most
painful
to
the
mind
of
the
peasant
 
and
now
the
funeral
psalm
be
to
be
sing
in
memory
of
his
sudden
departure
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
Bartle
Massey
be
not
at
church
,
and
Joshua
's
importance
in
the
choir
suffer
no
eclipse
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
solemn
minor
strain
they
sing
.
<EOS>
the
old
psalm
-
tune
have
many
a
wail
among
them
,
and
the
word
         
Thou
sweep'st
us
off
as
with
a
flood
;
     
We
vanish
hence
like
dream
    
seem
to
have
a
close
application
than
usual
in
the
death
of
poor
Thias
.
<EOS>
the
mother
and
son
listen
,
each
with
peculiar
feeling
.
<EOS>
Lisbeth
have
a
vague
belief
that
the
psalm
be
do
her
husband
good
;
it
be
part
of
that
decent
burial
which
she
would
have
think
it
a
great
wrong
to
withhold
from
him
than
to
have
cause
him
many
unhappy
day
while
he
be
live
.
<EOS>
the
more
there
be
say
about
her
husband
,
the
more
there
be
do
for
him
,
surely
the
safe
he
would
be
.
<EOS>
It
be
poor
Lisbeth
's
blind
way
of
feel
that
human
love
and
pity
be
a
ground
of
faith
in
some
other
love
.
<EOS>
Seth
,
who
be
easily
touch
,
shed
tear
,
and
try
to
recall
,
as
he
have
do
continually
since
his
father
's
death
,
all
that
he
have
hear
of
the
possibility
that
a
single
moment
of
consciousness
at
the
last
may
be
a
moment
of
pardon
and
reconcilement
;
for
be
it
not
write
in
the
very
psalm
they
be
singe
that
the
Divine
dealing
be
not
measure
and
circumscribe
by
time
?
<EOS>
Adam
have
never
be
unable
to
join
in
a
psalm
before
.
<EOS>
He
have
know
plenty
of
trouble
and
vexation
since
he
have
be
a
lad
,
but
this
be
the
first
sorrow
that
have
hem
in
his
voice
,
and
strangely
enough
it
be
sorrow
because
the
chief
source
of
his
past
trouble
and
vexation
be
for
ever
go
out
of
his
reach
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
able
to
press
his
father
's
hand
before
their
parting
,
and
say
,
"
<EOS>
Father
,
you
know
it
be
all
right
between
us
;
I
never
forget
what
I
owe
you
when
I
be
a
lad
<EOS>
;
you
forgive
me
if
I
have
be
too
hot
and
hasty
now
and
then
!
"
<EOS>
Adam
think
but
<EOS>
little
to
-
day
of
the
hard
work
and
the
earning
he
have
spend
on
his
father
:
his
thought
run
constantly
on
what
the
old
man
's
feeling
have
be
in
moment
of
humiliation
,
when
he
have
hold
down
his
head
before
the
rebuke
of
his
son
.
<EOS>
when
our
indignation
be
bear
in
submissive
silence
,
we
be
apt
to
feel
twinge
of
doubt
afterwards
as
to
our
own
generosity
,
if
not
justice
;
how
much
more
when
the
object
of
our
anger
have
go
into
everlasting
silence
,
and
we
have
see
his
face
for
the
last
time
in
the
meekness
of
death
!
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
I
be
always
too
hard
,
"
Adam

<EOS>
"
It
be
a
sore
fault
in
me
as
I
be
so
hot
and
out
<EOS>
o
'
patience
with
people
when
they
do
wrong
,
and
my
heart
get
shut
up
against
'em
,
so
as
I
can
not
bring
myself
to
forgive
'em
.
<EOS>
I
see
clear
enough
<EOS>
there
be
more
pride
nor
love
in
my
soul
,
for
I
could
sooner
make
a
thousand
stroke
with
th
'
hammer
for
my
father
than
bring
myself
to
say
a
kind
word
to
him
.
<EOS>
and
there
go
plenty
o
'
pride
and
temper
to
the
stroke
,
as
the
devil
WILL
be
have
his
finger
in
what
we
call
our
duty
as
well
as
our
sin
.
<EOS>
mayhap
the
good
thing
I
ever
do
in
my
life
be
only
do
what
be
easy
for
myself
.
<EOS>
It
be
allay
be
easy
for
me
to
work
nor
to
sit
still
,
but
the
real
tough
job
for
me
'
ud
be
to
master
my
own
will
and
temper
and
go
right
against
my
own
pride
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
now
,
if
I
be
to
find
Father
at
home
to
-
night
,
I
should
behave
different
;
but
there
be
no
knowing
 
<EOS>
perhaps
nothing
'
ud
be
a
lesson
to
us
if
it
do
not
come
too
late
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
we
should
feel
as
life
's
a
reckoning
we
can
not
make
twice
over
;
there
be
no
real
make
amend
in

any
more
nor
you
can
mend
a
wrong
subtraction
by

your
addition
right

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
key
-
note
to
which
Adam
's
thought
have
perpetually
return
since
his
father
's
death
,
and
the
solemn
wail
of
the
funeral
psalm
be
only
an
influence
that
bring
back
the
old
thought
with
strong
emphasis
.
<EOS>
so
be
the
sermon
,
which
Mr.
Irwine
have
choose
with
reference
to
Thias
's
funeral
.
<EOS>
It
speak
briefly
and
simply
of
the
word
,
"
in
the
midst
of
life
we
be
in
death
"
 
<EOS>
how
the
present
moment
be
all
we
can
call
our
own
for
work
of
mercy
,
of
righteous
dealing
,
and
of
family
tenderness
.
<EOS>
all
very
old
truth
 
but
<EOS>
what
we
think
the
old
truth
become
the
most
startling
to
us
in
the
week
when
we
have
look
on
the
dead
face
of
one
who
have
make
a
part
of
our
own
life
.
<EOS>
for
when
man
want
to
impress
us
with
the
effect
of
a
new
and
wonderfully
vivid
light
,
do
they
not
let
it
fall
on
the
most
familiar
object
,
that
we
may
measure
its
intensity
by
remember
the
former
dimness
?
  
<EOS>
then
come
the
moment
of
the
final
blessing
,
when
the
forever
sublime
word
,
"
the
peace
of
God
,
which
passeth
all
understanding
,
"
seem
to
blend
with
the
calm
afternoon
sunshine
that
fall
on
the
bow
head
of
the
congregation
;
and
then
the
quiet
rising
,
the
mother
tie
on
the
bonnet
of
the
little
maiden
who
have
sleep
through
the
sermon
,
the
father
collect
the
prayer
-
book
,
until
all
stream
out
through
the
old
archway
into
the
green
churchyard
and
begin
their
neighbourly
talk
,
their
simple
civility
,
and
their
invitation
to
tea
;
for
on
a
Sunday
every
one
be
ready
to
receive
a
guest
 
<EOS>
it
be
the
day
when
all
must
be
in

good
clothe

their
good
humour

<EOS>
Mr.

pause
a
minute
at

gate
:
they
be

for
Adam
to

up

not

away
without

<EOS>
Adam
never
take
notice
of
his

;

Seth

it

say
Mr.

,
feel
that
his

as

rather
incisive
than

,
and
that
it
would
be
well
to
change
the

<EOS>
,
"

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
pause
and
look
round
while
he
be
speak
,
as
if
to
see
where
Hetty
be
;
for
the
child
be
run
on
before
.
<EOS>
Hetty
be
not
without
a
companion
,
and
she
have
,
besides
,
more
pink
and
white
about
her
than
ever
,
for
she
hold
in
her
hand
<EOS>
the
wonderful
pink
-
and
-
white
hot
-
house
plant
,
with
a
very
long
name
 
a
Scotch
name
<EOS>
,
she
suppose
,
since
people
say
Mr.
Craig
the
gardener
be
Scotch
.
<EOS>
Adam
take
the
opportunity
of
look
round
too
;
and
I
be
sure
you
will
not
require
of
him
that
he
should
feel
any
vexation
in
observe
a
pouting
expression
on
Hetty
's
face
as
she
listen
to
the
gardener
's
small
talk
.
<EOS>
yet
in
her
secret
heart
she
be
glad
to
have
him
by
her
side
,
for
she
would
perhaps
learn
from
him
how
it
be
Arthur
<EOS>
have
not
come
to
church
.
<EOS>
not
that
she
care
to
ask
him
the
question
,
but
she
hope
the
information
would
be
give
spontaneously
;
for
Mr.
Craig
,
like
a
superior
man
,
be
very
fond
of
give
information
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Craig
be
never
aware
that
his
conversation
and
advance
be
receive
coldly
,
for
to
shift
one
's
point
of
view
beyond
certain
limit
be
impossible
to
the
most
liberal
and
expansive
mind
;
we
be
none
of
us
aware
of
the
impression
we
produce
on
brazilian
monkey
of
feeble
understanding
 
<EOS>
it
be
possible
they
see
hardly
anything
in
us
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
Mr.
Craig
be
a
man
of
sober
passion
,
and
be
already
in
his
tenth
year
of
hesitation
as
to
the
relative
advantage
of
matrimony
and
bachelorhood
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
,
now
and
then
,
when
he
have
be
a
little
heated
by
an
extra
glass
of
grog
,
he
have
be
hear
to
say
of
Hetty
that
the
"
lass
be
well
enough
,
"
and
that
"
a
man
may
do
bad
"
;
but
on
convivial
occasion
man
be
apt
to
express
themselves
strongly
.
  
<EOS>
Martin
Poyser
hold
Mr.
Craig
in
honour
,
as
a
man
who
"
know
his
business
"
and
who
have
great
light
concern
soil
and
compost
;
but
he
be
less
of
a
favourite
with
Mrs.
Poyser
,
who
have
more
than
once
say
in
confidence
to
her
husband
,
"
You
be
mighty
fond
o
'
Craig
,
but
for
my
part
,
I
think
he
be
welly
like
a
cock
as
think
the
sun
's
rise
o
'
purpose
to
hear
him
crow
.
<EOS>
"
for
the
rest
,
Mr.
Craig
be
an
estimable
gardener
,
and
be
not
without
reason
for
have
a
high
opinion
of
himself
.
<EOS>
He
have
also
high
shoulder
and
high
cheek
-
bone
and
hang
his
head
forward
a
little
,
as
he
walk
along
with
his
hand
in
his
breech
pocket
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
his
pedigree
only
that
have
the
advantage
of
be
Scotch
,
and
not
his
"
bring
up
"
;
for
except
that
he
have
a
strong
burr
in
his
accent
,
his
speech
differ
little
from
that
of
the
Loamshire
people
about
him
.
<EOS>
but
a
gardener
be
Scotch
,
as
a
french
teacher
be
parisian
.
  
<EOS>
"
well

Mr.
Poyser

he
say
,
before

reckon
he
will
be
back
again
afore
many
day
be
o'er
,
for
he
be
to
be
at
all
th

and

for
the
comin

o

<EOS>
age
o

<EOS>
the
30th
o

<EOS>
July
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
<EOS>
fond
o
'
get
away
for
a
bit
,
now
and
then
.
<EOS>
Him
and
th
'
old
squire
fit
one
another
like
frost
and
flower
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Craig
smile
and
wink
slowly
as
he
make
this
last
observation
,
but
the
subject
be
not
develop
farther
,
for
now
they
have
reach
the
turning
in
the
road
where
Adam
and
his
companion
must
say
"
good
-
bye
.
"
<EOS>
the
gardener
,
too
,
would
have
have
to
turn
off
in
the
same
direction
if
he
have
not
accept
Mr.
Poyser
's
invitation
to
tea
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
duly
second
the
invitation
,
for
she
would
have
hold
it
a
deep
disgrace
not
to
make
her
neighbour
welcome
to
her
house
:
personal
like
and
dislikes
must
not
interfere
with
that
sacred
custom
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
Mr.
Craig
have
always
be
full
of
civility
to
the
family
at
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
Mrs.
Poyser
be
scrupulous
in
declare
that
she
have
"
nothing
to
say
again
'
him
,
on'y
<EOS>
it
be
a
pity
he
couldna
be
hatch
o'er
again
,
an
'
hatched
different
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
Adam
and
Seth
,
with
their
mother
between
them
,
wound
their
way
down
to
the
valley
and
up
again
to
the
old
house
,
where
a
sadden
memory
have
take
the
place
of
a
long
,
long
anxiety
 
where
Adam
would
never
have
to
ask
again
as
he
enter
,
"
where
be
Father
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
the
other
family
party
,
with
Mr.
Craig
for
company
,
go
back
to
the
pleasant
bright
house
-
place
at
the
Hall
Farm
 
all
with
quiet
mind
,
except
Hetty
,
who
know
now
where
Arthur
be
go
,
but
be
only
the
more
puzzled
and
uneasy
.
<EOS>
for
it
appear
that
his
absence
be
quite
voluntary
;
he
nee
not
have
go
 
<EOS>
he
would
not
have
go
if
he
have
want
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
sickening
sense
that
no
lot
could
ever
be
pleasant
to
her
again
if
her
Thursday
night
's
vision
be
not
to
be
fulfil
;
and
in
this
moment
of
chill
,
bare
,
wintry
disappointment
and
doubt
,
she
look
towards
the
possibility
of
be
with
Arthur
again
,
of
meet
his
love
glance
,
and
hear
his
soft
word
with
that
eager
yearning
which
one
may
call
the
"
grow
pain
"
of
passion
.
    
<EOS>
Adam
on
a
Working
Day
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
Mr.
Craig
's
prophecy
,
the
dark
-
blue
cloud
disperse
itself
without
have
produce
the
threaten
consequence
.
<EOS>
"
the
weather
"
 
as
he
observe
the
next
morning
 
<EOS>
"
the
weather
,
you
see
,
be
a
ticklish
thing
,
an
'
a
fool
'
ull
hit
on't
sometimes
when
a
wise
man
miss
;
that
be
why
the
almaneck
get
so
much
credit
.
<EOS>
It
be
<EOS>
one
o
'
them
chancy
thing
as
fool
thrive
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
unreasonable
behaviour
of
the
weather
,
however
,
could
displease
no
one
else
in
Hayslope
besides
Mr.
Craig
.
<EOS>
all
hand
be
to
be
out
in
the
meadow
this
morning
as
soon
as
the
dew
have
rise
;
the
wife
and
daughter
do
double
work
in
every
farmhouse
,
that
the
maid
may
give
their
help
in
toss
the
hay
;
and
when
Adam
be
march
along
the
lane
,
with
his
basket
of
tool
over
his
shoulder
,
he
catch
the
sound
of
jocose
talk
and
ring
laughter
from
behind
the
hedge
.
<EOS>
the
jocose
talk
of
hay
-
maker
be
good
at
a
distance
;
like
those
clumsy
bell
round
the
cow
'
neck
,
it
have
rather
a
coarse
sound
when
it
come
close
,
and
may
even
grate
on
your
ear
painfully
;
but
hear
from
far
off
,
it
mingle
very
prettily
with
the
other
joyous
sound
of
nature
.
<EOS>
man
's
muscle
move
better
when
their
soul
be
make
merry
music
,
though
their
merriment
be
of
a
poor
blundering
sort
,
not
at
all
like
the
merriment
of
bird
.
  
<EOS>
and
perhaps
there
be
no
time
in
a
summer
's
day
more
cheering
than
when
the
warmth
of
the
sun
be
just
begin
to
triumph
over
the
freshness
of
the
morning
 
<EOS>
when
there
be
just
a
linger
hint
of
early
coolness
to
keep
off
languor
under
the
delicious
influence
of
warmth
.
<EOS>
the
reason
Adam
be
walk
along
the
lane
at
this
time
be
because
his
work
for
the
rest
of
the
day
lie
at
a
country
-
house
about
three
mile
off
,
which
be
be
put
in
repair
for
the
son
of
a
neighbouring
squire
;
and
he
have
be
busy
since
early
morning
with
the
packing
of
panel
,
door
,
and
chimney
-
piece
,
in
a
waggon
which
be
now
go
on
before
him
,
while
Jonathan
Burge
himself
have
ride
to
the
spot
on
horseback
,
to
await
its
arrival
and
direct
the
workman
.
  
<EOS>
this
little
walk
be
a
rest
to
Adam
,
and
he
be
unconsciously
under
the
charm
of
the
moment
.
<EOS>
It
be
summer
morning
in
his
heart
,
and
he
see
Hetty
in
the
sunshine
 
a
sunshine
without
glare
,
with
slanting
ray
that
tremble
between
the
delicate
shadow
of
the
leave
.
<EOS>
He
think
,
yesterday
when
he
put
out
his
hand
to
her
as
they
come
out
of
church
,
that
there
be
a
touch
of
melancholy
kindness
in
her
face
,
such
as
he
have
not
see
before
,
and
he
take
it
as
a
sign
that
she
have
some
sympathy
with
his
family
trouble
.
<EOS>
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
that
touch
of
melancholy
come
from
quite
another
source
,
but
how
be
he
to
know
?
<EOS>
We
look
at
the
one
little
woman
's
face
we
love
as
we
look
at
the
face
of
our
mother
earth
,
and
see
all
sort
of
answer
to
our
own
yearning
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
Adam
not
to
feel
that
what
have
happen
in
the
last
week
have
bring
the
prospect
of
marriage
nearer
to
him
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
he
have
feel
keenly
the
danger
that
some
other
man
may
step
in
and
get
possession
of
Hetty
's
heart
and
hand
,
while
he
himself
be
still
in
a
position
that
make
him
shrink
from
ask
her
to
accept
him
.
<EOS>
even
if
he
have
have
a
strong
hope
that
she
be
fond
of
him
 
and
his
hope
be
far
from
be
strong
 
<EOS>
he
have
be
too
heavily
burden
with
other
claim
to
provide
a
home
for
himself
and
Hetty
 
<EOS>
a
home
such
as
he
could
expect
her
to
be
content
with
after
the
comfort
and
plenty
of
the
Farm
.
<EOS>
like
all
strong
nature
,
Adam
have
confidence
in
his
ability
to
achieve
something
in
the
future
;
he
feel
sure
he
should
some
day
,
if
he
live
,
be
able
to
maintain
a
family
and
make
a
good
broad
path
for
himself
;
but
he
have
too
cool
a
head
not
to
estimate
to
the
full
the
obstacle
that
be
to
be
overcome
.
<EOS>
and
the
time
would
be
so
long
!
<EOS>
and
there
be
Hetty
,
like
a
bright
-
cheek
apple
hang
over
the
orchard
wall
,
within
sight
of
everybody
,
and
everybody
must
long
for
her
!
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
if
she
love
him
very
much
,
she
would
be
content
to
wait
for
him
:
but
do
she
love
him
?
<EOS>
His
hope
have
never
rise
so
high
that
he
have
dare
to
ask
her
.
<EOS>
He
be
clear
-
sighted
enough
to
be
aware
that
her
uncle
and
aunt
would
have
look
kindly
on
his
suit
,
and
indeed
,
without
this
encouragement
he
would
never
have
persevere
in
go
to
the
Farm
;
but
it
be
impossible
to
come
to
any
but
fluctuate
conclusion
about
Hetty
's
feeling
.
<EOS>
She
be
like
a
kitten
,
and
have
the
same
distractingly
pretty
look
,
that
mean
nothing
,
for
everybody
that
come
near
her
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
he
could
not
help
say
to
himself
that
the
heavy
part
of
his
burden
be
remove
,
and
that
even
before
the
end
of
another
year
his
circumstance
may
be
bring
into
a
shape
that
would
allow
him
to
think
of
marry
.
<EOS>
It
would
always
be
a
hard
struggle
with
his
mother
,
he
know
:
she
would
be
jealous
of
any
wife
he
may
choose
,
and
she
have
set
her
mind
especially
against
Hetty
 
perhaps
for
no
other
reason
than
that
she
suspect
Hetty
to
be
the
woman
he
have
choose
.
<EOS>
It
would
never
do
,
he
fear
,
for
his
mother
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
him
when
he
be
married
;
and
yet
how
hard
she
would
think
it
if
he
ask
her
to
leave
him
!
<EOS>
yes
,
there
be
a
great
deal
of
pain
to
be
go
through
with
his
mother
,
but
it
be
a
case
in
which
he
must
make
her
feel
that
his
will
be
strong
 
it
would
be
well
for
her
in
the
end
.
<EOS>
for
himself
,
he
would
have
like
that
they
should
all
live
together
till
Seth
be
marry
,
and
they
may
have
build
a
bit
themselves
to
the
old
house
,
and
make
more
room
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
like
"
to
part
wi
'
th
'
lad
"
:
they
have
hardly
every
be
separate
for
more
than
a
day
since
they
be
bear
.
  
<EOS>
but
Adam
have
no
sooner
catch
his
imagination
leap
forward
in
this
way
 
make
arrangement
for
an
uncertain
future
 
than
he
check
himself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
pretty
building
I
be
make
,
without
either
brick
or
timber
.
<EOS>
I
be
up
<EOS>
i
'
the
garret
a'ready
,
and
have
not
so
much
as
dig
the
foundation
.
<EOS>
"
whenever
Adam
be
strongly
convinced
of
any
proposition
,
it
take
the
form
of
a
principle
in
his
mind
:
it
be
knowledge
to
be
act
on
,
as
much
as
the
knowledge
that
damp
will
cause
rust
.
<EOS>
perhaps
here
lie
the
secret
of
the
hardness
he
have
accuse
himself
of
:
he
have
too
little
fellow
-
feeling
with
the
weakness
that
err
in
spite
of
foreseen
consequence
.
<EOS>
without
this
fellow
-
feeling
,
how
be
we
to
get
enough
patience
and
charity
towards
our
stumbling
,
fall
companion
in
the
long
and
changeful
journey
?
<EOS>
and
there
be
but
one
way
in
which
a
strong
determined
soul
can
learn
it
 
by
get
his
heart
-
string
bind
round
the
weak
and
erring
,
so
that
he
must
share
not
only
the
outward
consequence
of
their
error
,
but
their
inward
suffering
.
<EOS>
that
be
a
long
and
hard
lesson
,
and
Adam
have
at
present
only
learn
the
alphabet
of
it
in
his
father
's
sudden
death
,
which
,
by
annihilate
in
an
instant
all
that
have
stimulate
his
indignation
,
have
send
a
sudden
rush
of
thought
and
memory
over
what
have
claim
his
pity
and
tenderness
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
Adam
's
strength
,
not
its
correlative
hardness
,
that
influence
his
meditation
this
morning
.
<EOS>
He
have
long
make
up
his
mind
that
it
would
be
wrong
as
well
as
foolish
for
him
to
marry
a
bloom
young
girl
,
so
long
as
he
have
no
other
prospect
than
that
of
grow
poverty
with
a
grow
family
.
<EOS>
and
his
saving
have
be
so
constantly
draw
upon
(
besides
the
terrible
sweep
of
pay
for
Seth
's
substitute
in
the
militia
)
that
he
have
not
enough
money
beforehand
to
furnish
even
a
small
cottage
,
and
keep
something
in
reserve
against
a
rainy
day
.
<EOS>
He
have
good
hope
that
he
should
be
"
firm
on
his
leg
"
by
and
by
;
but
he
could
not
be
satisfied
with
a
vague
confidence
in
his
arm
and
brain
;
he
must
have
definite
plan
,
and
set
about
them
at
once
.
<EOS>
the
partnership
with
Jonathan
Burge
be
not
to
be
think
of
at
present
 
there
be
thing
implicitly
tack
to
it
that
he
could
not
accept
;
but
Adam
think
that
he
and
Seth
may
carry
on
a
little
business
for
themselves
in
addition
to
their
journeyman
's
work
,
by
buy
a
small
stock
of
superior
wood
and
make
article
of
household
furniture
,
for
which
Adam
have
no
end
of
contrivance
.
<EOS>
Seth
may
gain
more
by
work
at
separate
job
under
Adam
's
direction
than
by
his
journeyman
's
work
,
and
Adam
,
in
his
overhours
,
could
do
all
the
"
nice
"
work
that
require
peculiar
skill
.
<EOS>
the
money
gain
in
this
way
,
with
the
good
wage
he
receive
as
foreman
,
would
soon
enable
them
to
get
beforehand
with
the
world
,
so
sparingly
as
they
would
all
live
now
.
<EOS>
no
sooner
have
this
little
plan
shape
itself
in
his
mind
than
he
begin
to
be
busy
with
exact
calculation
about
the
wood
to
be
buy
and
the
particular
article
of
furniture
that
should
be
undertake
first
 
a
kitchen
cupboard
of
his
own
contrivance
,
with
such
an
ingenious
arrangement
of
slide
-
door
and
bolt
,
such
convenient
nook
for
stow
household
provender
,
and
such
a
symmetrical
result
to
the
eye
,
that
every
good
housewife
would
be
in
rapture
with
it
,
and
fall
through
all
the
gradation
of
melancholy
longing
till
her
husband
promise
to
buy
it
for
her
.
<EOS>
Adam
picture
to
himself
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
examine
it
with
her
keen
eye
and
try
in
vain
to
find
out
a
deficiency
;
and
,
of
course
,
close
to
Mrs.
Poyser
stand
Hetty
,
and
Adam
be
again
beguile
from
calculation
and
contrivance
into
dream
and
hope
.
<EOS>
yes
,
he
would
go
and
see
her
this
evening
 
<EOS>
it
be
so
long
since
he
have
be
at
the
Hall
Farm
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
like
to
go
to
the
night
-
school
,
to
see
why
Bartle
Massey
have
not
be
at
church
yesterday
,
for
he
fear
his
old
friend
be
ill
;
but
,
unless
he
could
manage
both
visit
,
this
last
must
be
put
off
till
to
-
morrow
 
the
desire
to
be
near
Hetty
and
to
speak
to
her
again
be
too
strong
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
make
up
his
mind
to
this
,
he
be
come
very
near
to
the
end
of
his
walk
,
within
the
sound
of
the
hammer
at
work
on
the
refit
of
the
old
house
.
<EOS>
the
sound
of
tool
to
a
clever
workman
who
love
his
work
be
like
the
tentative
sound
of
the
orchestra
to
the
violinist
who
have
to
bear
his
part
in
the
overture
:
the
strong
fibre
begin
their
accustomed
thrill
,
and
what
be
a
moment
before

limit
of

lot
in
the
labour
of
our

the
cunning
of

<EOS>
look
at
Adam
through
the
rest
of
the
day
,
as
he
stand
on
the
scaffolding
with
the
two

foot
ruler
in
his

whistle
low
while
he
consider
how
a
difficulty
about
a
floor

joist
or
a
window

frame
be
to
be
overcome
;
or
as
he
push
one

Thee'st

he
fix
his
keen
black
eye
on
the
motion
of
a
workman
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
warn
him
that
his
distance
be
not
right

<EOS>
look
at
this
broad

shouldered
man
with
the
bare
muscular
arm
,
and
the
thick
,
firm
,
black
hair
toss
about
like
trodden
meadow

whenever

take
off
his
paper

with
the
strong
barytone
voice
burst
every
now

then
into
loud
and
solemn
psalm

tune

as
if
seek
an
outlet
for
superfluous
strength
,
yet
presently
check
himself
,
apparently
cross
by
some
thought
which
jar
with
the
singing

<EOS>
perhaps
,
if
you

you
may

guess
what
sad
memory

what
warm
affection

<EOS>
what
tender
flutter

,
have
their
home
in
this
athletic
body
with
the
broken

in
this
rough
man
,
who
know
no
well
lyric
than
he
could
find
in
the
Old
and
New
Version
and
an
occasional
hymn
;
who
know
the
small
possible
amount
of
profane
history

and
for
whom
the
motion
and
shape
of
the
earth
,
the
course
of
the
sun
,
and
the
change
of
the
season
lie
in
the
region
of
mystery
just
make
visible
by
fragmentary
knowledge
.
<EOS>
It
have
cost
Adam
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
work
in
overhour
to
know
what
he
know
over
and
above
the
secret
of
his
handicraft
,
and
that
acquaintance
with
mechanic
and
figure
,
and
the
nature
of
the
material
he
work
with
,
which
be
make
easy
to
him
by
inborn
inherit
faculty
 
to
get
the
mastery
of
his
pen
,
and
write
a
plain
hand
,
to
spell
without
any
other
mistake
than
must
in
fairness
be
attribute
to
the
unreasonable
character
of
orthography
rather
than
to
any
deficiency
in
the
speller
,
and
,
moreover
,
to
learn
his
musical
note
and
part
-
singing
.
<EOS>
besides
all
this
,
he
have
read
his
Bible
,
include
the
apocryphal
book
;
Poor
Richard

Almanac
,
Taylor
's
Holy
Living
and
Dying
,
the
Pilgrim

Progress

with
Bunyan

a
great
deal
of
Bailey

Dictionary
,
Valentine

Orson
,
and
part
of
a
history
of
Babylon
,
which
Bartle
Massey
have
lend
him
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
have
many
more
book
from
Bartle

he
have
no
time
for
reading
"
the

Lisbeth
call
it

so
busy
as

be

Adam
,
you
perceive
,
be
by
no
mean
a
marvellous
man
,
nor
,
properly
speak
,
a
genius
,
yet
I
will
not
pretend
that
his
be
an
ordinary
character
among
workman
;
and
it
would
not
be
at
all
a
safe
conclusion
that
the
next
good
man
you
may
happen
to
see
with
a
basket
of
tool
over
his
shoulder
and
a
paper
cap
on
his
head
have
the
strong
conscience
and
the
strong
sense
,
the
blended
susceptibility
and
self
-
command
,
of
our
friend
Adam
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
an
average
man
.
<EOS>
yet
such
man
as
he
be
rear
here
and
there
in
every
generation
of
our
peasant
artisan
 
with
an
inheritance
of
affection
nurture
by
a
simple
family
life
of
common
need
and
common
industry
,
and
an
inheritance
of
faculty
train
in
skilful
courageous
labour
:
they
make
their
way
upwards
,
rarely
as
genius
,
most
commonly
as
painstaking
honest
man
,
with
the
skill
and
conscience
to
do
well
<EOS>
the
task
that
lie
before
them
.
<EOS>
Their
life
have
no
discernible
echo
beyond
the
neighbourhood
where
they
dwelt
,
but
you
be
almost
sure
to
find
there
some
good
piece
of
road
,
some
building
,
some
application
of
mineral
produce
,
some
improvement
in
farming
practice
,
some
reform
of
parish
abuse
,
with
which
their
name
be
associate
by
one
or
two
generation
after
them
.
<EOS>
Their
employer
be
the
rich
for
them
,
the
work
of
their
hand
have
wear
well
,
and
the
work
of
their
brain
have
guide
well
the
hand
of
other
man
.
<EOS>
They
go
about
in
their
youth
in
flannel
or
paper
cap
,
in
coat
black
with
coal
-
dust
or
streak
with
lime
and
red
paint
;
in
old
age
their
white
hair
be
see
in
a
place
of
honour
at
church
and
at
market
,
and
they
tell
their
well
-
dress
son
and
daughter
,
seat
round
the
bright
hearth
on
winter
evening
,
how
pleased
they
be
when
they
first
earn
their
twopence
a

day
.
<EOS>
other
there
be
who
die
poor
and
never
put
off
the
workman
's
coal
on
weekday
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
have
the
art
of
get
rich
,
but
they
be
man
of
trust
,
and
when
they
die
before
the
work
be
all
out
of
them
,
it
be
as
if
some
main
screw
have
get
loose
in
a

the

than
Lisbeth
become
uneasy
at
the
thought
that
she
have
vex
him
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
the
secret
of
her
objection
to
the
good

be
her
suspicion
that
they
be
put
on
for
Hetty
's
sake
;
but
deep
than
all
her
peevishness
lie
the
need
that
her

love

She
hurry

take
the

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
be
not
to
be
catch
in
the
weakness
of
smile
at
a
compliment
,
but
a
quiet
complacency
over
-
spread
her
face
like
a
steal
sunbeam
,
and
give
a
milder
glance
than
usual
to
her
blue
-
grey
eye
,
as
she
look
at
Adam
drink
the
whey
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
I
think
I
taste
that
whey
now
 
with
a
flavour
<EOS>
so
delicate
that
one
can
hardly
distinguish
it
from
an
odour
,
and
with
that
soft
glide
warmth
that
fill
one
's
imagination
with
a
still
,
happy
dreaminess
.
<EOS>
and
the
light
music
of
the
dropping
whey
be
in
my
ear
,
mingle
with
the
twittering
of
a
bird
outside
the
wire
network
window
 
the
window
overlook
the
garden
,
and
shade
by
tall
Guelder
rose

<EOS>
"
have
a
little
more
,
Mr.
Bede
?
"
say
Mrs.
Poyser
,
as
Adam
set
down
the
basin
.
  
<EOS>
"
no

thank
you
;
I
will
go
into
the
garden
now

send
in

<EOS>
"
aye

do

<EOS>
Adam
walk
round
by
the
rick
-
yard
,
at
present
empty
of
rick
,
to
the
little
wooden
gate
lead
into
the
garden
 
once
the
well
-
tend
kitchen
-
garden
of
a
manor
-
house
;
now
,
but
for
the
handsome
brick
wall
with
stone
cope
that
run
along
one
side
of
it
,
a
true
farmhouse
garden
,
with
hardy
perennial
flower
,
unpruned
fruit
-
tree
,
and
kitchen
vegetable
grow
together
in
careless
,
half
-
neglect
abundance
.
<EOS>
in
that
leafy
,
flowery
,
bushy
time
,
to
look
for
any
one
in
this
garden
be
like
play
at
"
hide
-
and
-
seek
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
the
tall
hollyhock
begin
to
flower
and
dazzle
the
eye
with
their
pink
,
white
,
and
yellow
;
there
be
the
syringas
and
Guelder
rose
,
all
large
and
disorderly
for
want
of
trim
;
there
be
leafy
wall
of
scarlet
bean
and
late
pea
;
there
be
a
row
of
bushy
filbert
in
one
direction
,
and
in
another
a
huge
apple
-
tree
make
a
barren
circle
under
its
low
-
spread
bough
.
<EOS>
but
what
signify
a
barren
patch
or
two
?
<EOS>
the
garden
be
so
large
.
<EOS>
there
be
always
a
superfluity
of
broad
bean
 
<EOS>
it
take
nine
or
ten
of
Adam
's
stride
to
get
to
the
end
of
the
uncut
grass
walk
that
run
by
the
side
of
them
;
and
as
for
other
vegetable
,
there
be
so
much
more
room
than
be
necessary
for
them
that
in
the
rotation
of
crop
a
large
flourishing
bed
of
groundsel
be
of
yearly
occurrence
on
one
spot
or
other
.
<EOS>
the
very
rose
-
tree
at
which
Adam
stop
to
pluck
one
look
as
if
they
grow
wild
;
they
be
all
huddle
together
in
bushy
masse
,
now
flaunt
with
wide
-
open
petal
,
almost
all
of
them
of
the
streak
pink
-
and
-
white
kind
,
which
doubtless
date
from
the
union
of
the
house
of
York
and
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
Adam
be
wise
enough
to
choose
a
compact
Provence
<EOS>
rise
that
peep
out
half
-
smother
by
its
flaunting
scentless
neighbour
,
and
hold
it
in
his
hand
 
<EOS>
he
think
he
should
be
more
at
ease
hold
something
in
his
hand
 
as
he
walk
on
to
the
far
end
of
the
garden
,
where
he
remember
there
be
the
large
row
of
currant
-
tree
,
not
far
off
from
the
great
yew
-
tree
arbour
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
have
not
go
many
step
beyond
the
rose
,
when
he
hear
the
shaking
of
a
bough
,
and
a
boy
's
voice
say
,
"
now
,
then
,
Totty
,
hold
out
your
pinny
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
duck
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
voice
come
from
the
bough
of
a
tall
cherry
-
tree
,
where
Adam
have
no
difficulty
in
discern
a
small
blue
-
pinafored
figure
perch
in
a
commodious
position
where
the
fruit
be
thickest
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
Totty
be
below
,
behind
the
screen
of
pea
.
<EOS>
yes
 
with
her
bonnet
hang
down
her
back
,
and
her
fat
face
,
dreadfully
smear
with
red
juice
,
turn
up
towards
the
cherry
-
tree
,
while
she
hold
her
little
round
hole
of
a
mouth
and
her
red
-
stain
pinafore
to
receive
the
promise
downfall
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
say
,
more
than
half
the
cherry
that
fall
be
hard
and
yellow
instead
of
juicy
and
red
;
but
Totty
spend
no
time
in
useless
regret
,
and
she
be
already
suck
the
third
juiciest
when
Adam
say
,
"
there
now
,
Totty
,
you
have
get
your
cherry
.
<EOS>
run
into
the
house
with
'em
to
Mother
 
<EOS>
she
want
you
 
<EOS>
she
be
in
the
dairy
.
<EOS>
run
in
this
minute
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
good
little
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
lift
her
up
in
his
strong
arm
and
kiss
her
as
he
speak
,
a
ceremony
which
Totty
regard
as
a
tiresome
interruption
to
cherry
-
eating
;
and
when
he
set
her
down
she
trot
off
quite
silently
towards
the
house
,
suck
her
cherry
as
she
go
along
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tommy
,
my
lad
,
take
care
<EOS>
you
be
not
shoot
for
a
little
thieving
bird
,
"
say
Adam
,
as
he
walk
on
towards
the
currant
-
tree
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
see
there
be
a
large
basket
at
the
end
of
the
row
:
<EOS>
Hetty
would
not
be
far
off
,
and
Adam
already
feel
as
if
she
be
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
yet
when
he
turn
the
corner
she
be
stand
with
her
back
towards
him
,
and
stoop
to
gather
the
low
-
hang
fruit
.
<EOS>
strange
that
she
have
not
hear
him
come
!
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
because
she
be
make
the
leave
rustle
.
<EOS>
She
start
when
she
become
conscious
that
some
one
be
near
 
start
so
violently
that
she
drop
the
basin
with
the
currant
in
it
,
and
then
,
when
she
see
it
be
Adam
,
she
turn
from
pale
to
deep
red
.
<EOS>
that
blush
make
his
heart
beat
with
a
new
happiness
.
<EOS>
Hetty
have
never
blush
at
see
him
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
frighten
you
,
"
he
say
,
with
a
delicious
sense
that
it
do
not
signify
what
he
say
,
since
Hetty
seem
to
feel
as
much
as
he
do
;
"
let
me
pick
the
currant
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
that
be
soon
do
,
for
they
have
only
fall
in
a
tangle
mass
on
the
grass
-
plot
,
and
Adam
,
as
he
rise
and
give
her
the
basin
again
,
look
straight
into
her
eye
with
the
subdued
tenderness
that
belong
to
the
first
moment
of
hopeful
love
.
  
<EOS>
Hetty
do
not
turn
away
her
eye
;
her
blush
have
subside
,
and
she
meet
his
glance
with
a
quiet
sadness
,
which
content
Adam
because
it
be
so
unlike
anything
he
have
see
in
her
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
not
many
more
currant
to
get
,
"
she
say
;
"
I
shall
soon
ha
'
do
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
help
you
,
"
say
Adam
;
and
he
fetch
the
large
basket
,
which
be
nearly
full
of
currant
,
and
set
it
close
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
not
a
word
more
be
speak
as
they
gather
the
currant
.
<EOS>
Adam
's
heart
be
too
full
to
speak
,
and
he
think
Hetty
know
all
that
be
in
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
indifferent
to
his
presence
after
all
;
she
have
blush
when
she
see
him
,
and
then
there
be
that
touch
of
sadness
about
her
which
must
surely
mean
love
,
since
it
be
the
opposite
of
her
usual
manner
,
which
have
often
impress
him
as
indifference
.
<EOS>
and
he
could
glance
at
her
continually
as
she
bend
over
the
fruit
,
while
the
level
evening
sunbeam
steal
through
the
thick
apple
-
tree
bough
,
and
rest
on
her
round
cheek
and
neck
as
if
they
too
be
in
love
with
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
Adam
the
time
that
a
man
can
least
forget
in
after
-
life
,
the
time
when
he
believe
that
the
first
woman
he
have
ever
love
betray
by
a
slight
something
 
a
word
,
a
tone
,
a
glance
,
the
quivering
of
a
lip
or
an
eyelid
 
that
she
be
at
least
begin
to
love
him
in
return
.
<EOS>
the
sign
be
so
slight
,
it
be
scarcely
perceptible
to
the
ear
or
eye
 
he
could
describe
it
to
no
one
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
mere
feather
-
touch
,
yet
it
seem
to
have
change
his
whole
being
,
to
have
merge
an
uneasy
yearning
into
a
delicious
unconsciousness
of
everything
but
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
so
much
of
our
early
gladness
vanish
utterly
from
our
memory
<EOS>
:
we
can
never
recall
the
joy
with
which
we
lay
our
head
on
our
mother
's
bosom
or
ride
on
our
father
's
back
in
childhood
.
<EOS>
doubtless
that
joy
be
work
up
into
our
nature
,
as
the
sunlight
of
long
-
past
morning
be
work
up
in
the
soft
mellowness
of
the
apricot
,
but
it
be
go
for
ever
from
our
imagination
,
and
we
can
only
believe
in
the
joy
of
childhood
.
<EOS>
but
the
first
glad
moment
in
our
first
love
be
a
vision
which
return
to
us
to
the
last
,
and
bring
with
it
a
thrill
of
feel
intense
and
special
as
the
recurrent
sensation
of
a
sweet
odour
breathe
in
a
far
-
off
hour
of
happiness
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
memory
that
give
a
more
exquisite
touch
to
tenderness
,
that
feed
the
madness
of
jealousy
and
add
the
last
keenness
to
the
agony
of
despair
.
  
<EOS>
Hetty
bend
over
the
red
bunche
<EOS>
,
the
level
ray
pierce
the
screen
of
apple
-
tree
bough
,
the
length
of
bushy
garden
beyond
,
his
own
emotion
as
he
look
at
her
and
believe
that
she
be
think
of
him
,
and
that
there
be
no
need
for
them
to
talk
 
Adam
remember
it
all
to
the
last
moment
of
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
and
Hetty
?
<EOS>
You
know
quite
well
that
Adam
be
mistake
about
her
.
<EOS>
like
many
other
man
,
he
think
the
sign
of
love
for
another
be
sign
of
love
towards
himself
.
<EOS>
when
Adam
be
approach
unseen
by
her
,
she
be
absorb
as
usual
in
think
and
wonder
about
Arthur
's
possible
return
.
<EOS>
the
sound
of
any
man
's
footstep
would
have
affect
her
just
in
the
same
way
 
she
would
have
FELT
it
may
be
Arthur
before
she
have
time
to
see
,
and
the
blood
that
forsook
her
cheek
in
the
agitation
of
that
momentary
feeling
would
have
rush
back
again
at
the
sight
of
any
one
else
just
as
much
as
at
the
sight
of
Adam
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
wrong
in
think
that
a
change
have
come
over
Hetty
:
the
anxiety
and
fear
of
a
first
passion
,
with
which
she
be
tremble
,
have
become
strong
than
vanity
,
have
give
her
for
the
first
time
that
sense
of
helpless
dependence
on
another
's
feeling
which
awaken
the
cling
deprecate
womanhood
even
in
the
shallow
girl
that
can
ever
experience
it
,
and
create
in
her
a
sensibility
to
kindness
which
find
her
quite
hard
before
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
Hetty
feel
that
there
be
something
soothing
to
her
in
Adam
's
timid
yet
manly
tenderness
.
<EOS>
She
want
to
be
treat
lovingly
 
<EOS>
oh
,
it
be
very
hard
to
bear
this
blank
of
absence
,
silence
,
apparent
indifference
,
after
those
moment
of
glow
love
!
<EOS>
She
be
not
afraid
that
Adam
would
tease
her
with
love
-
making
and
flattering
speech
like
her
other
admirer
;
he
have
always
be
so
reserved
to
her
;
she
could
enjoy
without
any
fear
the
sense
that
this
strong
brave
man
love
her
and
be
near
her
.
<EOS>
It
never
enter
into
her
mind
that
Adam
be
pitiable
too
 
that
Adam
too
must
suffer
one
day
.
  
<EOS>
Hetty
,
we
know
,
be
not
the
first
woman
that
have
behave
more
gently
to
the
man
who
love
her
in
vain
because
she
have
herself
begin
to
love
another
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
old
story
,
but
Adam
know
nothing
about
it
,

the
fact
enter
into

which
he
would
like

promise
in

and
it
be
true
that

listen
with
an
interest

bring
a

into

a
half

Hetty
take

smile
as

do
so
at
the
pleasant
thought
that
Arthur
could
so
soon
get
back
if

like

there
be
a
flash
of
hope

happiness
in

with

sudden
impulse

gaiety

she
do
what
she
have
very
often
do

stick
the

above

the
tender
admiration
in
Adam

slightly
shadow
by
reluctant
disapproval

<EOS>
Hetty
's
love
of
finery
be
just
the
thing
that
would
most
provoke
his
mother

and
he
himself
dislike
it
as
much
as
it
be
possible
for
him
to
dislike
anything
that
belong

her

<EOS>
"
ah
,
"
he

,
"
that
be
like
the
lady
in

they
have
mostly
get
flower

feather

gold
thing

i

their
hair

somehow
I
do
not

to
see
'em

they
allays
put
me
<EOS>
i

mind
<EOS>
o
'
the
paint
woman
outside
the
show
at
Treddles'on
Fair

<EOS>
what
can
a
woman
have
to
set
her
off
better
than
her
own
hair
,
when
it
curl
so
,
like
yours
?
<EOS>
if
a
woman
's
young
and
pretty
,
I
think
you
can
see
her
good
<EOS>
look
all
the
well
for
her
be
plain
dressed
.
<EOS>
why
,
Dinah
Morris
look
very
nice
,
for
all
she
wear
such
a
plain
cap
and
gown
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
as
a
woman
's
face
doesna
want
flower
;
it
be
almost
like
a
flower
itself
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
yours
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
very
well
,
"
say
Hetty
,
with
a
little
playful
pout
,
take
the
rose
out
of
her
hair
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
put
one
o
'
<EOS>
Dinah
's
cap
on
when
we
go
in
,
and
you
will
see
if
I
look
better
in
it
.
<EOS>
She
leave
one
behind
,
so
I
can
take
the
pattern
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
nay
,
I
do
not
want
you
to
wear
a
Methodist
cap
like
Dinah
's
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
it
be
a
very
ugly
cap
,
and
I
use
to
think
when
I
see
her
here
as
it
be
nonsense
for
her
to
dress
different
t
'
other
people
;
but
I
never
rightly
notice
her
till
she
come
to
see
mother
last
week
,
and
<EOS>
then
I
think
the
cap
seem
to
fit
her
face
somehow
as
th
<EOS>
'
acorn
-
cup
fit
th
'
acorn
,
and
I
should
not
like
to
see
her
so
well
without
it
.
<EOS>
but
you
have
get
another
sort
<EOS>
o
'
face
;
I
would
have
you
just
as
you
be
now
,
without
anything
t
'
interfere
with
your
own
look
.
<EOS>
It
be
like
when
a
man
's
singe
a
good
tune
 
<EOS>
you
do
not
want
t
'
hear
bell
tinkle
and
interfere
wi
'
the
sound
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
her
arm
and
put
it
within
his
again
,
look
down
on
her
fondly
.
<EOS>
He
be
afraid
she
should
think
he
have
lecture
her
,
imagine
,
as
we
be
apt
to
do
,
that
she
have
perceive
all
the
thought
he
have
only
half
-
express
.
<EOS>
and
the
thing
he
dread
most
be
lest
any
cloud
should
come
over
this
evening
's
happiness
.
<EOS>
for
the
world
he
would
not
have
speak
of
his
love
to
Hetty
yet
,
till
this
commence
kindness
towards
him
should
have
grow
into
unmistakable
love
.
<EOS>
in
his
imagination
he
see
long
year
of
his
future
life
stretch
before
him
,
blest
with
the
right
to
call
Hetty
his
own
:
he
could
be
content
with
very
little
at
present
.
<EOS>
so
he
take
up
the
basket
of
currant
once
more
,
and
they
go
on
towards
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
scene
have
quite
change
in
the
half
-
hour
that
Adam
have
be
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
the
yard
be
full
of
life
now
:
Marty
be
let
the
scream
geese
through
the
gate
,
and
wickedly
provoke
the
gander
by
hiss
at
him
;
the
granary
-
door
be
groan
on
its
hinge
as
Alick
shut
it
,
after
deal
out
the
corn
;
the
horse
be
be
lead
out
to
water
,
amidst
much
barking
of
all
the
three
dog
and
many
"
whup
"
from
Tim
<EOS>
the
ploughman
,
as
if
the
heavy
animal
who
hold
down
their
meek
,
intelligent
head
,
and
lift
their
shaggy
foot
so
deliberately
,
be
likely
to
rush
wildly
in
every
direction
but
the
right
.
<EOS>
everybody
be
come
back
from
the
meadow
;
and
when
Hetty
and
Adam
enter
the
house

place
,
Mr.

be

in
the
three

corner
chair

and
the

chair
opposite

look
on
with
pleasant
expectation
while

supper
be
be
lay
on

<EOS>
Mrs.

have
lay
the
cloth
herself
 
a

of
homespun
linen
,
with
a
shine
checker
pattern
on
it

and
of
an
agreeable
whitey

such

that
would
wear
into
hole
in
no

but
good
homespun
that
would
last
for
two
generation
.
<EOS>
the
cold
veal
,
the
fresh
lettuce
,
and
the
stuff
chine
may
well
look
tempting
to
hungry
man
who
have
dine
at

past
twelve
o'clock

on
the
large

for
the
master

their
supper
not

off

which
be

this
be
say
in

low
tone
than
usual
,
while
her
husband
be
talk
to
Adam
;
for
Mrs.
Poyser
be
strict
in
adherence
to
her
own
rule
of
propriety

she
consider
that
a
young
girl
be
not

treat
sharply
in
the
presence
of
a
respectable
man
who
be
court
her

<EOS>
that
would
not

play

every

be
young
in

turn

have
her
chance
of
matrimony

which
it
be
a
point
of

go
out

soon
they

<EOS>
to

<EOS>
the
Night
-
School
and
the
Schoolmaster
  
Bartle
Massey

be
one
of
a
few
scatter
house
on
the
edge
of
a
common
,
which
be
divide
by
the
road
to
Treddleston
.
<EOS>
Adam
reach
it
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
leave
the
Hall
Farm
;
and
when
he
have
his
hand
on
the
door
-
latch
,
he
could
see
,
through
the
curtainless
window
,
that
there
be
eight
or
nine
head
bend
over
the
desk
,
light
by
thin
dip
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
enter
,
a
reading
lesson
be
go
forward
and
Bartle
Massey
merely
nod
,
leave
him
to
take
his
place
where
he
please
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
come
for
the
sake
of
a
lesson
to
-
night
,
and
his
mind
be
too
full
of
personal
matter
,
too
full
of
the
last
two
hour
he
have
pass
in
Hetty
's
presence
,
for
him
to
amuse
himself
with
a
book
till
school
<EOS>
be
over
;
so
he
sit
down
in
a
corner
and
look
on
with
an
absent
mind
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
sort
of
scene
which
Adam
have
behold
almost
weekly
for
year
;
he
know
by
heart
every
arabesque
flourish
in
the
framed
speciman
of
Bartle
Massey
's
handwriting
which
hang
over
the
schoolmaster
's
head
,
by
way
of
keep
a
lofty
ideal
before
the
mind
of
his
pupil
;
he
know
the
back
of
all
the
book
on
the
shelf
run
along
the
whitewashed
wall
above
the
peg
for
the
slate
;
he
know
exactly
how
many
grain
be
go
out
of
the
ear
of
indian
corn
that
hang
from
one
of
the
rafter
;
he
have
long
ago
exhaust
the
resource
of
his
imagination
in
try
to
think
how
the
bunch
of
leathery
seaweed
have
look
and
grow
in
its
native
element
;
and
from
the
place
where
he
sit
,
he
could
make
nothing
of
the
old
map
of
England
that
hang
against
the
opposite
wall
,
for
age
have
turn
it
of
a
fine
yellow
brown
,
something
like
that
of
a
well
-
season
meerschaum
.
<EOS>
the
drama
that
be
go
on
be
almost
as
familiar
as
the
scene
,
nevertheless
habit
have
not
make
him
indifferent
to
it
,
and
even
in
his
present
self
-
absorb
mood
,
Adam
feel
a
momentary
stirring
of
the
old
fellow
-
feeling
,
as
he
look
at
the
rough
man
painfully
hold
pen
or
pencil
with
their
cramp
hand
,
or
humbly
labour
through
their
reading
lesson
.
  
<EOS>
the
read
class
now
seat
on
the
form
in
front
of
the
schoolmaster
's
desk
consist
of
the
three
most
backward
pupil
.
<EOS>
Adam
would
have
know
it
only
by
see
Bartle
Massey
's
face
as
he
look
over
his
spectacle
,
which
he
have
shift
to
the
ridge
of
his
nose
,
not
require
them
for
present
purpose
.
<EOS>
the
face
wear
its
mild
expression
:
the
grizzle
bushy
eyebrow
have
take
their
more
acute
angle
of
compassionate
kindness
,
and
the
mouth
,
habitually
compress
with
a
pout
of
the
low
lip
,
be
relaxed
so
as
to
be
ready
to
speak
a
helpful
word
or
syllable
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
this
gentle
expression
be
the
more
interesting
because
the
schoolmaster
's
nose
,
an
irregular
aquiline
twist
a
little
on
one
side
,
have
rather
a
formidable
character
;
and
his
brow
,
moreover
,
have
that
peculiar
tension
which
always
impress
one
as
a
sign
of
a
keen
impatient
temperament
:
the
blue
vein
stand
out
like
cord
under
the
transparent
yellow
skin
,
and
this
intimidate
brow
be
soften
by
no
tendency
to
baldness
,
for
the
grey
bristly
hair
,
cut
down
to
about
an
inch
in
length
,
stand
round
it
in
as
close
rank
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Bill
,
nay
,
<EOS>
"
Bartle
be
say
in
a
kind
tone
,
as
he
nod
to
Adam
,
"
begin
that
again
,
and
then
perhaps
,
it
will
come
to
you
what
d
-
<EOS>
r
-
y
spell
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
same
lesson
you
read
last
week
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bill
"
be
a
sturdy
fellow
,
aged
four
-
and
-
twenty
,
an
excellent
stone
-
sawyer
,
who
could
get
as
good
wage
as
any
man
in
the
trade
of
his
year
;
but
he
find
a
reading
lesson
in
word
of
one
syllable
a
hard
matter
to
deal
with
than
the
hard
stone
he
have
ever
have
to
saw
.
<EOS>
the
letter
,
he
complain
,
be
so
"
uncommon
alike
,
there
be
no
tellin
'
<EOS>
'em
one
from
another
,
"
the
sawyer
's
business
not
be
concern
with
minute
difference
such
as
exist
between
a
letter
with
its
tail
turn
up
and
a
letter
with
its
tail
turn
down
.
<EOS>
but
Bill
have
a
firm
determination
that
he
would
learn
to
read
,
found
chiefly
on
two
reason
:
<EOS>
first
,
that
Tom
Hazelow
,
his
cousin
,
could
read
anything
"
right
off
,
"
whether
it
be
print
or
writing
,
and
Tom
have
send
him
a
letter
from
twenty
mile
off
,
say
how
he
be
prosper
in
the
world
and
have
get
an
overlook
's
place
;
secondly
,
that
Sam
Phillips
,
who
saw
with
him
,
have
learn
to
read
when
he
be
turn
twenty
,
and
what
could
be
do
by
a
little
fellow
like
Sam
Phillips
,
Bill
consider
,
could
be
do
by
himself
,
see
that
he
could
pound
Sam
into
wet
clay
if
circumstance
require
it
.
<EOS>
so
here
he
be
,
point
his
big
finger
towards
three
word
at
once
,
and
turn
his
head
on
one
side
that
he
may
keep
well
hold
with
his
eye
of
the
one
word
which
be
to
be
discriminate
out
of
the
group
.
<EOS>
the
amount
of
knowledge
Bartle
Massey
must
possess
be
something
so
dim
and
vast
that
Bill
's
imagination
recoil
before
it
:
he
would
hardly
have
venture
to
deny
that
the
schoolmaster
may
have
something
to
do
in
bring
about
the
regular
return
of
daylight
and
the
change
in
the
weather
.
  
<EOS>
the
man
seat
next
to
Bill
be
of
a
very
different
type
:
he
be
a
Methodist
brickmaker
who
,
after
spend
thirty
year
of
his
life
in
perfect
satisfaction
with
his
ignorance
,
have
lately
"
get
religion
,
"
and
along
with
it
the
desire
to
read
the
Bible
.
<EOS>
but
with
him
,
too
,
learn
be
a
heavy
business
,
and
on
his
way
out
to
-
night
he
have
offer
as
usual
a
special
prayer
for
help
,
see
that
he
have
undertake
this
hard
task
with
a
single
eye
to
the
nourishment
of
his
soul
 
that
he
may
have
a
great
abundance
of
text
and
hymn
wherewith
to
banish
evil
memory
and
the
temptation
of
old
habit
 
or
,
in
brief
language
,
the
devil
.
<EOS>
for
the
brickmaker
have
be
a
notorious
poacher
,
and
be
suspect
,
though
there
be
no
good
evidence
against
him
,
of
be
the
man
who
have
shoot
a
neighbouring
gamekeeper
in
the
leg
.
<EOS>
however
that
may
be
,
it
be
certain
that
shortly
after
the
accident
refer
to
,
which
be
coincident
with
the
arrival
of
an
awaken
Methodist
preacher
at
Treddleston
,
a
great
change
have
be
observe
in
the
brickmaker
;
and
though
he
be
still
know
in
the
neighbourhood
by
his
old
sobriquet
of
"
Brimstone
,
"
there
be
nothing
he
hold
in
so
much
horror
as
any
further
transaction
with
that
evil
-
smell
element
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
broad
-
cheste
fellow
with
a
fervid
temperament
,
which
help
him
better
in
imbibe
religious
idea
than
in
the
dry
process
of
acquire
the
mere
human
knowledge
of
the
alphabet
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
have
be
already
a
little
shaken
in
his
resolution
by
a
brother
Methodist
,
who
assure
him
that
the
letter
be
a
mere
obstruction
to
the
Spirit
,
and
express
a
fear
that
Brimstone
be
too
eager
for
the
knowledge
that
puffeth
up
.
  
<EOS>
the
third
beginner
be
a
much
more
promising
pupil
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
tall
but
thin
and
wiry
man
,
nearly
as
old
as
Brimstone
,
with
a
very
pale
face
and
hand
stain
a
deep
blue
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
dyer
,
who
in
the
course
of
dip
homespun
wool
and
old
woman
's
petticoat
have
get
fire
with
the
ambition
to
learn
a
great
deal
more
about
the
strange
secret
of
colour
.
<EOS>
He
have
already
a
high
reputation
in
the
district
for
his
dye
,
and
he
be
bent
on
discover
some
method
by
which
he
could
reduce
the
expense
of
crimson
and
scarlet
.
<EOS>
the
druggist
at
Treddleston
have
give
him
a
notion
that
he
may
save
himself
a
great
deal
of
labour
and
expense
if
he
could
learn
to
read
,
and
so
he
have
begin
to
give
his
spare
hour
to
the
night
-
school
,
resolve
that
his
"
little
chap
"
should
lose
no
time
in
come
to
Mr.
Massey
's
day
-
school
as
soon
as
he
be
old
enough
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
touch
to
see
these
three
big
man
,
with
the
mark
of
their
hard
labour
about
them
,
anxiously
bend
over
the
worn
book
and
painfully
make
out
,
"
the
grass
be
green
,
"
"
the
stick
be
dry
,
"
"
the
corn
be
ripe
"
 
a
very
hard
lesson
to
pass
to
after
column
of
single
word
all
alike
except
in
the
first
letter
.
<EOS>
It
be
almost
as
if
three
rough
animal
be
make
humble
effort
to
learn
how
they
may
become
human
.
<EOS>
and
it
touch
the
tender
fibre
in
Bartle
Massey
's
nature
,
for
such
full
-
grown
child
as
these
be
the
only
pupil
for
whom
he
have
no
severe
epithet
and
no
impatient
tone
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
gift
with
an
imperturbable
temper
,
and
on
music
-
night
it
be
apparent
that
patience
could
never
be
an
easy
virtue
to
him
;
but
<EOS>
this
evening
,
as
he
glance
over
his
spectacle
at
Bill
Downes
,
the
sawyer
,
who
be
turn
his
head
on
one
side
with
a
desperate
sense
of
blankness
before
the
letter
d
-
r
-
y
,
his
eye
shed
their
mild
and
most
encouraging
light
.
  
<EOS>
after
the
reading
class
,
two
youth
between
sixteen
and
nineteen
come
up
with
the
imaginary
bill
of
parcel
,
which
they
have
be
write
out
on
their
slate
and
be
now
require
to
calculate
"
off
-
hand
"
 
a
test
which
they
stand
with
such
imperfect
success
that
Bartle
Massey
,
whose
eye
have
be
glare
at
them
ominously
through
his
spectacle
for
some
minute
,
at
length
burst
out
in
a
bitter
,
high
-
pitch
tone
,
pause
between
every
sentence
to
rap
the
floor
with
a
knobbed
stick
which
rest
between
his
leg
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
you
see
,
you
do
not
do
this
thing
a
bit
better
than
you
do
a
fortnight
ago
,
and
I
will
tell
you
what
be
the
reason
.
<EOS>
You
want
to
learn
account
 
<EOS>
that
be
well
and
good
.
<EOS>
but
you
think
all
you
need
do
to
learn
account
be
to
come
to
me
and
do
sum
for
an
hour
or
so
,
two
or
three
time
a
-
week
;
and
no
sooner
do
you
get
your
cap
on
and
turn
out
of
door
again
than
you
sweep
the
whole
thing
clean
out
of
your
mind
.
<EOS>
You
go
whistle
about
,
and
take
no
more
care
what
you
be
think
of
than
if
your
head
be
gutter
for
any
rubbish
to
swill
through
that
happen
to
be
in
the
way
;
and
if
you
get
a
good
notion
in
'em
,
it
be
pretty
soon
wash
out
again
.
<EOS>
You
think
knowledge
be
to
be
get
cheap
 
<EOS>
you
will
come
and
pay
Bartle
Massey
sixpence
a
-
week
,
and
he
will
make
you
clever
at
figure
without
your
take
any
trouble
.
<EOS>
but
knowledge
be
not
to
be
get
with
pay
sixpence
,
let
me
tell
you
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
to
know
figure
,
you
must
turn
'em
over
in
your
head
and
keep
your
thought
fix
on
'em
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
you
can
not
turn
into
a
sum
,
for
there
be
nothing
but
<EOS>
what
be
get
number
in
it
 
even
a
fool
.
<EOS>
You
may
say
to
yourself
,
"
I
be
one
fool
,
and
Jack
be
another
;
if
my
fool
's
head
weigh
four
pound
,
and
Jack
's
three
pound
three
ounce
and
three
quarter
,
<EOS>
how
many
pennyweight
heavier
would
my
head
be
than
Jack
's
?
"
<EOS>
a
man
that
have
get
his
heart
in
learning
figure
would
make
sum
for
himself
and
work
'em
in
his
head
.
<EOS>
when
he
sit
at
his
shoemaking
,
he
would
count
his
stitch
by
five
,
and
then
put
a
price
on
his
stitch
,
say
half
a
farthing
,
and
then
see
how
much
money
he
could
get
in
an
hour
;
and
then
ask
himself
how
much
money
he
would
get
in
a
day
at
that
rate
;
<EOS>
and
then
how
much
ten
workman
would
get
work
three
,
or
twenty
,
or
<EOS>
a
hundred
year
at
that
rate
 
and
all
the
while
his
needle
would
be
go
just
as
fast
as
if
he
leave
his
head
empty
for
the
devil
to
dance
in
.
<EOS>
but
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
be
 
I
will
have
nobody
in
my
night
-
school
that
do
not
strive
to
learn
what
he
come
to
learn
,
as
hard
as
if
he
be
strive
to
get
out
of
a
dark
hole
into
broad
daylight
.
<EOS>
I
will
send
no
man
away
because
he
be
stupid
:
if
Billy
Taft
,
the
idiot
,
want
to
learn
anything
,
I
would
not
refuse
to
teach
him
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
throw
away
good
knowledge
on
people
who
think
they
can
get
it
by
the
sixpenn'orth
,
and
carry
it
away
with
'em
as
they
would
an
ounce
of
snuff
.
<EOS>
so
never
come
to
me
again
,
if
you
can
not
show
that
you
have
be
work
with
your
own
head
,
instead
of
think
that
you
can
pay
for
mine
to
work
for
you
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
last
word
I
have
get
to
say
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
this
final
sentence
,
Bartle
Massey
give
a
sharp
rap
than
ever
with
his
knobbed
stick
,
and
the
discomfited
lad
get
up
to
go
with
a
sulky
look
.
<EOS>
the
other
pupil
have
happily
only
their
writing
-
book
to
show
,
in
various
stage
of
progress
from
pot
-
hook
to
round
text
;
and
mere
pen
-
stroke
,
however
perverse
,
be
less
exasperating
to
Bartle
than
false
arithmetic
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
little
more
severe
than
usual
on
Jacob
Storey
's
Z

,
of
which
poor
Jacob
have
write
a
pageful
,
all
with
their
top
<EOS>
turn
the
wrong
way
,
with
a
puzzled
sense
that
they
be
not
right
"
somehow
.
<EOS>
"
but
he
observe
in
apology
,
that
it
be
a
letter
you
never
want
hardly
,
and
he
think
it
have
only
be
there
"
to
finish
off
th

alphabet
,
like
,
though
ampusand

would
ha

<EOS>
for
what
he
could
see

"
  
<EOS>
at
last
the
pupil
have
all
take
their
hat
and
say
their
"
Good

night
,
"
and
Adam
,
know
his
old
master
's
habit
,
rise
and
say
,
"
Shall
I
put
the
candle
out
,
Mr.
Massey

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
my

,
yes
,
all
but
this
,
which
I
will
carry
into
the
house
;
and
just
lock
the
outer
door
,
now
you
be
near
it
,
"
say
Bartle
,
get
his
stick
in
the
fitting
angle
to
help
him
in
descend
from
his
stool
.
<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
on
the
ground
than
it
become
obvious
why
the
stick
be
necessary
 
<EOS>
the
left
leg
be
much
short
than
the
right
.
<EOS>
but
the
school
-
master
be
so
active
with
his
lameness
that
it
be
hardly
think
of
as
a
misfortune
;
and
if
you
have
see
him
make
his
way
along
the
schoolroom
floor
,
and
up
the
step
into
his
kitchen
,
you
would
perhaps
have
understand
why
the
naughty
boy
sometimes
feel
that
his
pace
may
be
indefinitely
quicken
and
that
he
and
his
stick
may
overtake
them
even
in
their
swift
run
.
  
<EOS>
the
moment
he
appear
at
the
kitchen
door
with
the
candle
in
his
hand
,
a
faint
whimpering
begin
in
the
chimney

corner
,
and
a
brown

tan

colour
bitch
,
of
that
wise

look
breed
with
short
leg
and
long
body
,
know
to
an
unmechanical
generation
as
turnspit
,
come
creep
along
the
floor
,
wag
her
tail
,
and
hesitate
at
every
other
step

as
if
her
affection
be
painfully

between
the
hamper
in
the
chimney

corner
and
the
master
,
whom
she
could
not
leave
without
a
greeting

<EOS>
"
well

Vixen

well
then
,
how

<EOS>
"
say
the
schoolmaster
,
make
haste
towards
the
chimney

corner
and
hold
the
candle
over
the
low
hamper
,
where
two
extremely
blind
puppy
lift
up
their
head
towards
the
light
from
a
nest
of
flannel
and
wool
.
<EOS>
Vixen
could
not
even
see
her
master
look
at
them
without
painful
excitement
:
she
get
into
the
hamper
and
get
out
again
the
next
moment
,
and
behave
with
true
feminine
folly
,
though
look
all
the
while
as
wise
as

"

say
Bartle
,
turn
away
from
the
hamper
with
some
bitterness

<EOS>
He
always
call

seem
to

<EOS>
Bartle
speak
these
last
word
in
a
rasping
tone
of
reproach
,
and
look
at
Vixen

who
poke
down

up

in

get
them
for

old
song

Vixen
feel
it
incumbent
on

to
jump
out
of
the

and
bark
vaguely
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quiet
,
Vixen
!

Bartle
,
turn
round
upon
her
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
like
the
rest

the

always
put
in
your
word
before

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Vixen
return
to
her
hamper
again
in
humiliation
,
and
her
master
continue
his
supper
in
a
silence
which
Adam
do
not
choose
to
interrupt
;
he
know
the
old
man
would
be
in
a
well
humour
when
he
have
have
his
supper
and
light
his
pipe
.
<EOS>
Adam
be
use
to
hear
him
talk
in
this
way
,
but
have
never
learn
so
much
of
Bartle
's
past
life
as
to
know
whether
his
view
of
married
comfort
be
found
on
experience
.
<EOS>
on
that
point
Bartle
be
mute
,
and
it
be
even
a
secret
where
he
have
live
previous
to
the
twenty
year
in
which
happily
for
the
peasant
and
artisan
of
this
neighbourhood
he
have
be
settle
among
them
as
their
only
schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
if
anything
like
a
question
be
venture
on
this
subject
,
Bartle
always
reply
,
"
oh
,
I
have
see
many
place
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
a
deal
in
the
south
,
"
and
the
Loamshire
man
would
as
soon
have
think
of
ask
for
a
particular
town
or
village
in
Africa
as
in
"
the
south
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
now
then
,
my
boy
,
"
say
Bartle
,
at
last
,
when
he
have
pour
out
his
second
mug
of
ale
and
light
his
pipe
,
"
now
then
,
we
will
have
a
little
talk
.
<EOS>
but
tell
me
first
,
have
you
hear
any
particular
news
to
-
day
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Adam
,
"
not
as
I
remember
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
they
will
keep
it
close
,
they
will
keep
it
close
,
I
daresay
.
<EOS>
but
I
find
it
out
by
chance
;
and
it
be
news
that
may
concern
you
,
Adam
,
<EOS>
else
I
be
a
man
that
do
not
know
a
superficial
square
foot
from
a
solid
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
Bartle
give
a
series
of
fierce
and
rapid
puff
,
look
earnestly
the
while
at
Adam
.
<EOS>
Your
impatient
loquacious
man
have
never
any
notion
of
keep
his
pipe
alight
by
gentle
measured
puff
;
he
be
always
let
it
go
nearly
out
,
and
then
punish
it
for
that
negligence
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
say
,
"
Satchell
's
get
a
paralytic
stroke
.
<EOS>
I
find
it
out
from
the
lad
they
send
to
Treddleston
for
the
doctor
,
before
seven
o'clock
this
morning
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
good
way
beyond
sixty
,
you
know
;
it
be
much
if
he
get
over
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Adam
,
"
I
daresay
there
'd
be
more
rejoice
than
sorrow
in
the
parish
at
his
being
lay
up
.
<EOS>
He
be
be
a
selfish
,
tale
-
bearing
,
mischievous
fellow
;
but
,
after
all
,
there
be
nobody
he
be
do
so
much
harm
to
as
to
th
'
old
squire
.
<EOS>
though
it
be
the
squire
himself
as
be
to
blame
 
make
a
stupid
fellow
like
that
a
sort
o
'
man
-
of
-
all
-
work
,
just
to
save
th
'
expense
of
have
a
proper
steward
to
look
after
th

<EOS>
and
he
be
lose
more
by
ill
management
o

<EOS>
the
wood

I
will
be
bind

than

ud
pay
for
two
steward
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
lay
on
the
shelf
,
it
be
to
be
hope
he
will
make
way
for
a
well
man
,
but
I
do
not
see
how
it
be
like
to
make
any
difference
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
see
it
,
but
I
see
it
,
"
say
Bartle
,
"
and
other
besides
me
.
<EOS>
the
captain
's
coming
of
age
now
 
<EOS>
you
know
that
as
well
as
I
do
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
to
be
expect
he
will
have
a
little
more
voice
in
thing
.
<EOS>
and
I
know
,
<EOS>
and
you
know
too
,
what
'
ud
be
the
captain
's
wish
about
the
wood
,
if
there
be
a
fair
opportunity
for
make
a
change
.
<EOS>
He
be
say
in
plenty
of
people
's
hearing
that
he
would
make
you
manager
of
the
wood
to
-
morrow
,
if
he
would
the
power
.
<EOS>
why
,
Carroll
,
Mr.
Irwine
's
butler
,
hear
him
say
so
to
the
parson
not
many
day
ago
.
<EOS>
Carroll
look
in
when
we
be
smoke
our
pipe
o
'
<EOS>
Saturday
night
at
Casson
's
,
and
he
tell
us
about
it
;
and
whenever
anybody
say
a
good
word
for
you
,
the
parson
's
ready
to
back
it
,
that
I
will
answer
for
.
<EOS>
It
be
pretty
well
talk
over
<EOS>
,
I
can
tell
you
,
at
Casson
's
,
and
one
and
another
have
their
fling
at
you
;
for
if
donkey
set
to
work
to
sing
,
you
be
pretty
sure
what
the
tune'll
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
do
they
talk
it
over
before
Mr.
Burge
?
"
say
Adam
;
"
or
be
not
he
there
o
'
Saturday
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
he
go
away
before
Carroll
come
;
and
Casson
 
<EOS>
he
be
always
for
set
other
folk
right
,
you
know
 
would
have
it
<EOS>
Burge
be
the
man
to
have
the
management
of
the
wood
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
substantial
man
,
"
say
he
,
"
with
pretty
near
sixty
year
'
experience
o
'
timber
:
it
'
ud
be
all
very
well
for
Adam
Bede
to
act
under
him
,
but
it
be
not
to
be
suppose
the
squire
'
ud
appoint
a
young
fellow
like
Adam
,
<EOS>
when
there
be
his
elder
and
better
at
hand
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
I
say
,
"
that
be
a
pretty
notion
o
'
your
,
Casson
.
<EOS>
why
,
Burge
be
the
man
to
buy
timber
;
would
you
put
the
wood
into
his
hand
and
let
him
make
his
own
bargain
?
<EOS>
I
think
you
do
not
leave
your
customer
to
score
their
own
drink
,
do
you
?
<EOS>
and
as
for
age
,
what
that
be
worth
depend
on
the
quality
o
'
the
liquor
.
<EOS>
It
be
pretty
well
known
who
be
the
backbone
of
Jonathan
Burge
's
business
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
thank
you
for
your
good
word
,
Mr.
Massey
,
"
say
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
,
for
all
that
,
Casson
be
partly
i
'
the
right
for
once
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
much
likelihood
that
th
'
old
squire
'
ud
ever
consent
t
'
employ
me
.
<EOS>
I
offend
him
about
two
year
ago
,
and
he
be
never
forgive
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
how
be
that
?
<EOS>
You
never
tell
me
about
it
,
"
say
Bartle
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
it
be
a
bit
o
'
nonsense
.
<EOS>
I
would
make
a
frame
for
a
screen
for
Miss
Lyddy
 
<EOS>
she
be
allay
make
something
with
her
worst
-
work
<EOS>
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
and
she
would
give
me
particular
order
about
this
screen
,
and
there
be
as
much
talk
and
measure
as
if
we
would
be
plan
a
house
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
a
nice
bit
o
'
work
,
and
I
like
do
it
for
her
.
<EOS>
but
,
you
know
,
those
little
friggle
thing
take
a
deal
o
'
time
.
<EOS>
I
only
work
at
it
in
overhours
 
often
late
at
night
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
to
go
to
Treddleston
over
an
'
over
again
about
little
bit
<EOS>
o
'
brass
nail
and
such
gear
;
and
I
turn
the
little
knob
and
the
leg
,
and
carve
th
'
open
work
,
after
a
pattern
,
as
nice
as
could
be
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
uncommon
pleased
with
it
when
it
be
do
.
<EOS>
and
when
I
take
it
home
,
Miss
Lyddy
send
for
me
to
bring
it
into
her
drawing
-
room
,
so
as
she
may
give
me
direction
about
fasten
on
the
work
 
<EOS>
very
fine
needlework
,
Jacob
and
Rachel
a
-
kiss
one
another
among
the
sheep
,
like
a
picture
 
and
th
<EOS>
'
old
squire
be
sit
there
,
for
he
mostly
sit
with
her
.
<EOS>
well
,
she
be
mighty
pleased
with
the
screen
,
and
then
she
want
to
know
what
pay
<EOS>
she
be
to
give
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
speak
at
random
 
<EOS>
you
know
it
be
not
my
way
;
I
would
calculate
pretty
close
,
though
I
have
not
make
out
a
bill
,
and
I
say
,
"
one
pound
thirty
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
pay
for
the
mater'al
and
pay
me
,
but
none
too
much
,
for
my
work
.
<EOS>
th
'
old
squire
look
up
at
this
,
and
peer
in
his
way
at
the
screen
,
and
say
,
"
one
pound
thirteen
for
a
gimcrack
like
that
!
<EOS>
Lydia
,
my
dear
,
if
you
must
spend
money
on
these
thing
,
why
do
not
you
get
them
at
Rosseter
,
instead
of
pay
double
price
for
clumsy
work
here
?
<EOS>
such
thing
be
not
work
for
a
carpenter
like
Adam
.
<EOS>
give
him
a
guinea
,
and
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
Miss
Lyddy
,
I
reckon
,
believe
what
he
tell
her
,
and
she
be
not
overfond
<EOS>
o
'
parting
with
the
money
herself
 
<EOS>
she
be
not
a
bad
woman
at
bottom
,
but
she
be
be
bring
up
under
his
thumb
;
so
she
begin
fidget
with
her
purse
,
and
turn
as
red
as
her
ribbon
.
<EOS>
but
I
make
a
bow
,
and
say
,
"
no
,
thank
you
,
madam
;
I
will
make
you
a
present
o
'
the
screen
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
I
have
charge
the
regular
price
for
my
work
,
and
I
know
it
be
do
well
;
and
I
know
,
beg
His
Honour
's
pardon
,
that
you
could
not
get
such
a
screen
at
Rosseter
under
two
guinea
.
<EOS>
I
be
willing
to
give
you
my
work
 
<EOS>
it
be
be
do
in
my
own
time
,
and
nobody
be
get
anything
to
do
with
it
<EOS>
but
me
<EOS>
;
but
if
I
be
pay
,
I
can
not
take
a
small
price
than
I
ask
,
because
that
'
ud
be
like

I
would
ask
more
than
be
just
.
<EOS>
with
your
leave
,
madam
,
I
will
bid
you
good

morning
.
<EOS>
"
I
make
my
bow
and
go
out
before
she
would
time
to
say
any
more
,
for
she
stand
with
the
purse
in
her
hand
,
look
almost
foolish
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
be
disrespectful
,
and
I
speak
as
polite
as
I
could
;
but
I
can
give
in
to
no
man
,
if
he
want
to
make
it
out
as
I
be
try
to
overreach
him
.
<EOS>
and
in
the
evening
the
footman
bring
me
the
one
pound
thirteen
wrap
in
paper
.
<EOS>
but
since
then
I
have
see
pretty
clear
as
th
'
old
squire
can
not
abide
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
likely
enough
,
that
be
likely
enough
,
"
say
Bartle
meditatively
.
<EOS>
"
the
only
way
to
bring
him
round
would
be
to
show
him
what
be
for
his
own
interest
,
and
that
the
captain
may
do
 
that
the
captain
may
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
Adam
;
"
the
squire
's
'
cute
enough
<EOS>
but
it
take
something
else
besides
'
cuteness
to
make
folk
see
what
will
be
their
interest
in
the
long
run
.
<EOS>
It
take
some
conscience
and
belief
in
right
and
wrong
,
I
see
that
pretty
clear
.
<EOS>
You
would
hardly
ever
bring
round
th
'
old
squire
to
believe
he
would
gain
as
much
in
a
straightfor'ard
way
as
by
trick
and
turn
.
<EOS>
and
,
besides
,
I
have
not
much
mind
to
work
under
him
<EOS>
:
I
do
not
want
to
quarrel
with
any
gentleman
,
<EOS>
more
particular
an
old
gentleman
turn
eighty
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
we
could
not
agree
long
.
<EOS>
if
the
captain
be
master
o

th
'
estate
,
it
'
ud
be
different
:
he
be
get
a
conscience
and
a
will
to
do
right

I
would
sooner
work
for
him
nor
for
any
man
live

well

well

my

if
good
luck
knock
at

not
you
put
your
head
out
at
window
and
tell
it
to

go
about
its
business

that
be
all

You
must
learn
to
deal
with
odd
and
even
in
life

as
well
as
in

<EOS>
I
tell
you
now

as
I
tell
you
ten
year
ago
,
when
you
pommel
young
Mike
Holdsworth
for

to
pass
a
bad
shilling
before
you

overhasty

proud

<EOS>
It
be
no
harm
for
me
to
be
a

fiery

stiff

back

I
be
an
old
schoolmaster

shall
never

on

where
be
the
use
of
all
the

I
have
spend
in
teach
you
write

mapping

mensuration

if
you

be
some
advantage
in

a

do
you

if

I

<EOS>
I

go
to
the
Birthday
Feast
  
<EOS>
the
thirtieth
of
July
be
come
,
and
it
be
one
of
those
half
-
dozen
warm
day
which
sometimes
occur
in
the
middle
of
a
rainy
english
summer
.
<EOS>
no
rain
have
fall
for
the
last
three
or
four
day
,
and
the
weather
be
perfect
for
that
time
of
the
year
:
there
be
less
dust
than
usual
on
the
dark
-
green
hedge
-
row
and
on
the
wild
camomile
that
star
the
roadside
,
yet
the
grass
be
dry
enough
for
the
little
child
to
roll
on
it
,
and
there
be
no
cloud
but
a
long
dash
of
light
,
downy
ripple
,
high
,
high
up
in
the
far
-
off
blue
sky
.
<EOS>
perfect
weather
for
an
outdoor
July
merry
-
making
,
yet
surely
not
the
good
time
of
year
to
be
bear
in
.
<EOS>
nature
seem
to
make
a
hot
pause
just
then
:
all
the
lovely
flower
be
go
;
the
sweet
time
of
early
growth
and
vague
hope
be
past
;
and
yet
the
time
of
harvest
and
ingathere
be
not
come
,
and
we
tremble
at
the
possible
storm
that
may
ruin
the
precious
fruit
in
the
moment
of
its
ripeness
.
<EOS>
the
wood
be
all
one
dark
monotonous
green
;
the
waggon
-
load
of
hay
no
longer
creep
along
the
lane
,
scatter
their
sweet
-
smell
fragment
on
the
blackberry
branch
;
the
pasture
be
often
a
little
tanned
,
yet
the
corn
have
not
get
its
last
splendour
of
red
and
gold
;
the
lamb
and
calf
have
lose
all
trace
of
their
innocent
frisky
prettiness
,
and
have
become
stupid
young
sheep
and
cow
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
time
of
leisure
on
the
farm
 
<EOS>
that
pause
between
hay
-
and
corn
-
harvest
,
and
<EOS>
so
the
farmer
and
labourer
in
Hayslope
and
Broxton
think
the
captain
do
well
to
come
of
age
just
then
,
when
they
could
give
their
undivided
mind
to
the
flavour
of
the
great
cask
of
ale
which
have
be
brew
the
autumn
after
"
the
heir
"
be
bear
,
and
be
to
be
tap
on
his
twenty
-
first
birthday
.
<EOS>
the
air
have
be
merry
with
the
ringing
of
church
-
bell
very
early
this
morning
,
and
every
one
have
make
haste
to
get
through
the
needful
work
before
twelve
,
when
it
would
be
time
to
think
of
get
ready
to
go
to
the
Chase
.
  
<EOS>
the
midday
sun
be
stream
into
Hetty
's
bedchamber
,
and
there
be
no
blind
to
temper
the
heat
with
which
it
fall
on
her
head
as
she
look
at
herself
in
the
old
specked
glass
.
<EOS>
still
,
that
be
the
only
glass
she
have
in
which
she
could
see
her
neck
and
arm
,
for
the
small
hang
glass
she
have
fetch
out
of
the
next
room
 
<EOS>
the
room
that
have
be
Dinah
's
 
would
show
her
nothing
below
her
little
chin
;
and
that
beautiful
bit
of
neck
where
the
roundness
of
her
cheek
melt
into
another
roundness
shadow
by
dark
delicate
curl
.
<EOS>
and
to
-
day
she
think
more
than
usual
about
her
neck
and
arm
;
for
at
the
dance
this
evening
she
be
not
to
wear
any
neckerchief
,
and
she
have
be
busy
yesterday
with
her
spotted
pink
-
and
-
white
frock
,
that
she
may
make
the
sleeve
either
long
or
short
at
will
.
<EOS>
She
be
dress
now
just
as
she
be
to
be
in
the
evening
,
with
a
tucker
make
of
"
real
"
lace
,
which
her
aunt
have
lend
her
for
this
unparalleled
occasion
,
but
with
no
ornament
besides
;
she
have
even
take
out
her
small
round
ear
-
ring
which
she
wear
every
day
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
something
more
to
be
do
,
apparently
,
before
she
put
on
her
neckerchief
and
long
sleeve
,
which
she
be
to
wear
in
the
day
-
time
,
for
now
she
unlock
the
drawer
that
hold
her
private
treasure
.
<EOS>
It
be
more
than
a
month
since
we
see
her
unlock
that
drawer
before
,
and
now
it
hold
new
treasure
,
so
much
more
precious
than
the
old
one
that
these
be
thrust
into
the
corner
.
<EOS>
Hetty
would
not
care
to
put
the
large
coloured
glass
ear
-
ring
into
her
ear
now
;
for
see
!
<EOS>
she
have
get
a
beautiful
pair
of
gold
and
pearl
and
garnet
,
lie
snugly
in
a
pretty
little
box
line
with
white
satin
.
<EOS>
oh
,
the
delight
of
take
out
that
little
box
and
look
at
the
ear
-
ring
!
<EOS>
do
not
reason
about
it
,
my
philosphical
reader
,
and
say
that
Hetty
,
be
very
pretty
,
must
have
know
that
it
do
not
signify
whether
she
have
on
any
ornament
or
not
;
and
that
,
moreover
,
to
look
at
ear
-
ring
which
she
could
not
possibly
wear
out
of
her
bedroom
could
hardly
be
a
satisfaction
,
the
essence
of
vanity
be
a
reference
to
the
impression
produce
on
other
;
you
will
never
understand
woman
's
nature
if
you
be
so
excessively
rational
.
<EOS>
try
rather
to
divest
yourself
of
all
your
rational
prejudice
,
as
much
as
if
you
be
study
the
psychology
of
a
canary
bird
,
and
only
watch
the
movement
of
this
pretty
round
creature
as
she
turn
her
head
on
one
side
with
an
unconscious
smile
at
the
ear
-
ring
nestle
in
the
little
box
.
<EOS>
ah
,
you
think
,
it
be
for
the
sake
of
the
person
who
have
give
them
to
her
,
and
her
thought
be
go
back
now
to
the
moment
when
they
be
put
into
her
hand
.
<EOS>
no
;
else
why
should
she
have
care
to
have
ear
-
ring
rather
than
anything
else
?
<EOS>
and
I
know
that
she
have
long
for
ear
-
ring
from
among
all
the
ornament
she
could
imagine
.
  
<EOS>
"
little
,
little
ear
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Arthur
have
say
,
pretend
to
pinch
them
one
evening
,
as
Hetty
sit
beside
him
on
the
grass
without
her
hat
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
have
some
pretty
ear
-
ring
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
in
a
moment
,
almost
before
she
know
what
she
be
say
 
the
wish
lie
so
close
to
her
lip
,
it
WOULD
flutter
past
them
at
the
slight
breath
.
<EOS>
and
the
next
day
 
it
be
only
last
week
 
Arthur
have
ride
over
to
rosseter
on
purpose
to
buy
them
.
<EOS>
that
little
wish
so
naively
utter
seem
to
him
the
pretty
bit
of
childishness
;
he
have
never
hear
anything
like
it
before
;
and
he
have
wrap
the
box
up
in
a
great
many
cover
,
that
he
may
see
Hetty
unwrap
it
with
grow
curiosity
,
till
at
last
her
eye
flash
back
their
new
delight
into
his
.
  
<EOS>
no
,
she
be
not
think
most
of
the
giver
when
she
smile
at
the
ear
-
ring
,
for
now
she
be
take
them
out
of
the
box
,
not
to
press
them
to
her
lip
,
but
to
fasten
them
in
her
ear
 
only
for
one
moment
,
to
see
how
pretty
they
look
,
as
she
peep
at
them
in
the
glass
against
the
wall
,
with
first
one
position
of
the
head
and
then
another
,
like
a
listening
bird
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
be
wise
on
the
subject
of
ear
-
ring
as
one
look
at
her
;
what
should
those
delicate
pearl
and
crystal
be
make
for
,
if
not
for
such
ear
?
<EOS>
one
can
not
even
find
fault
with
the
tiny
round
hole
which
they
leave
when
they
be
take
out
;
perhaps
water
-
nixie
,
and
such
lovely
thing
without
soul
,
have
these
little
round
hole
in
their
ear
by
nature
,
ready
to
hang
jewel
in
.
<EOS>
and
Hetty
must
be
one
of
them
<EOS>
:
it
be
too
painful
to
think
that
she
be
a
woman
,
with
a
woman
's
destiny
before
her
 
<EOS>
a
woman
spin
in
young
ignorance
a
light
web
of
folly
and
vain
hope
which
may
one
day
close
round
her
and
press
upon
her
,
a
rancorous
poison
garment
,
change
all
at
once
her
fluttering
,
trivial
butterfly
sensation
into
a
life
of
deep
human
anguish
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
can
not
keep
in
the
ear
-
ring
long
,
<EOS>
else
she
may
make
her
uncle
and
aunt
wait
.
<EOS>
She
put
them
quickly
into
the
box
again
and
shut
them
up
.
<EOS>
some
day
she
will
be
able
to
wear
any
ear
-
ring
she
like
,
and
already
she
live
in
an
invisible
world
of
brilliant
costume
,
shimmer
gauze
,
soft
satin
,
and
velvet
,
such
as
the
lady
's
maid
at
the
Chase
have
show
her
in
Miss
Lydia
's
wardrobe
.
<EOS>
She
feel
the
bracelet
on
her
arm
,
and
tread
on
a
soft
carpet
in
front
of
a
tall
mirror
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
one
thing
in
the
drawer
which
she
can
venture
to
wear
to
-
day
,
because
she
can
hang
it
on
the
chain
of
dark
-
brown
berry
which
she
have
be
use
to
wear
on
grand
day
,
with
a
tiny
flat
scent
-
bottle
at
the
end
of
it
tuck
inside
her
frock
;
and
she
must
put
on
her
brown
berry
 
her
neck
would
look
so
unfinished
without
it
.
<EOS>
Hetty
be
not
quite
as
fond
of
the
locket
as
of
the
ear
-
ring
,
though
it
be
a
handsome
large
locket
,
with
enamel
flower
at
the
back
and
a
beautiful
gold
border
round
the
glass
,
which
show
a
light
-
brown
slightly
wave
lock
,
form
a
background
for
two
little
dark
ring
.
<EOS>
She
must
keep
it
under
her
clothe
,
and
no
one
would
see
it
.
<EOS>
but
Hetty
have
another
passion
,
only
a
little
less
strong
than
her
love
of
finery
,
and
that
other
passion
make
her
like
to
wear
the
locket
even
hide
in
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
She
would
always
have
wear
it
,
if
she
have
dare
to
encounter
her
aunt
's
question
about
a
ribbon
round
her
neck
.
<EOS>
so
now
she
slip
it
on
along
her
chain
of
dark
-
brown
berry
,
and
snap
the
chain
round
her
neck
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
very
long
chain
,
only
allow
the
locket
to
hang
a
little
way
below
the
edge
of
her
frock
.
<EOS>
and
now
she
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
put
on
her
long
sleeve
,
her
new
white
gauze
neckerchief
,
and
<EOS>
her
straw
hat
trim
with
white
to
-
day
instead
of
the
pink
,
which
have
become
rather
fade
under
the
July
sun
.
<EOS>
that

She

Hetty

Captain

then
those

<EOS>
Mr.

have
once
suggest
that

be
shut
up
and
leave
to
take
care

;
"
for
,
"
say
he
,
"
there
be
no

of
anybody

<EOS>
everybody'll
be

<EOS>
if
we
lock

it
be
a

<EOS>
they
wonna
see
twice
<EOS>
i
'
their
life
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Poyser
answer
with
great
decision
:
"
I
never
leave
the
house
to
take
care
of
itself
since
I
be
a
missis
,
and
I
never
will
.
<EOS>
there
be
be
ill
-
look
tramps
enoo

about

this
last

to
carry
off

they

collogue
together

as
it
be

they
hanna
come

poison
the

murder
us

some
Friday
night

we'n
get
the

and
it
be

enough
<EOS>
the

know
where

you
may
be

he
will
find
the

<EOS>
"
  
"
nonsense
about
murder
us
in
our

"
say
Mr.

;
"
I

get
a

<EOS>
i

<EOS>
They

him
a

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
accept
this
compromise
,
but
think
it
advisable
to
bar
and
bolt
to
the
utmost
;

now
,
at
the
last
moment
before

Nancy

because
then
the

Nancy

be
an
excellent

<EOS>
but
Mr.

drive

the

a

for
the
remnant
of
an
old
abbey
to
which
it
be
unite
at
one
end
,
in
much
the

way
as
one
may
sometimes
see
a
new
farmhouse
rise
high

prim
at

old

low
farm

office

<EOS>
the
fine
old
remnant
stand
a

backward

the
sun

on

tall

the
house
seem
asleep
in
the
hot
midday

<EOS>
It
make
Hetty
quite
sad
to
look
at
it
:
Arthur
must
be
somewhere
in
the
back
room
,
with
the
grand
company
,
where
he
could
not
possibly
know
that
she
be
come
,
and
she
should
not
see
him
for
a
long
,
long
while
 
not
till
after
dinner
,
when
they
say
he
be
to
come
up
and
make
a
speech
.
  
<EOS>
but
Hetty
be
wrong
in
part
of
her
conjecture
.
<EOS>
no
grand
company
be
come
except
the
Irwines
,
for
whom
the
carriage
have
be
send
early
,
and
Arthur
be
at
that
moment
not
in
a
back
room
,
but
walk
with
the
rector
into
the
broad
stone
cloister
of
the
old
abbey
,
where
the
long
table
be
lay
for
all
the
cottage
tenant
and
the
farm
-
servant
.
<EOS>
a
very
handsome
young
Briton
he
look
to

day
,
in
high
spirit

a
bright

blue
frock

coat
,
the
high
mode
 
<EOS>
his
arm
no
longer
in

<EOS>
so
open

looking

candid

too

candid
people
have
their
secret

secret
leave
no
line
in
young
face

<EOS>
"
upon
my
word

"
he
say
,
as
they
enter
the
cool
cloister
,
"
I
think
the
cottager
have
the
good
of
it
:
these
cloister
make
a
delightful
dining

room
on
a
hot
day

<EOS>
that
be
capital
advice
of
yours

Irwine
,
about
the
dinner
 
to
let
them
be
as
orderly
and
comfortable
as
possible
,
and
only
for
the
tenant
:
especially
as
I
have
only
a
limited
sum
after
all
;
for
though
my
grandfather
talk
of
a
carte
blanche
,
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
trust
me
,
when
it
come
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
never
mind
,
you
will
give
more
pleasure
in
this
quiet
way
,
"
say
Mr.
Irwine
.
<EOS>
"
in
this
sort
of
thing
people
be
constantly
confound
liberality
with
riot
and
disorder
.
<EOS>
It
sound
very
grand
to
say
that
so
many
sheep
and
oxen
be
roast
whole
,
and
everybody
eat
who
like
to
come
;
but
in
the
end
it
generally
happen
that
no
one
have
have
an
enjoyable
meal
.
<EOS>
if
the
people
get
a
good
dinner
and
a
moderate
quantity
of
ale
in
the
middle
of
the
day
,
they
will
be
able
to
enjoy
the
game
as
the
day
cool
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
hinder
some
of
them
from
get
too
much
towards
evening
,
but
drunkenness
and
darkness
go
better
together
than
drunkenness
and
daylight
.
<EOS>

well
,
I
hope
there
will
not

much
of
it

I

<EOS>
and
I
will
tell
you
all
about
it
while
my
grandfather
be
in
the
drawing
-
room
with
the
lady
.
<EOS>
something
that
will
surprise
you
,
"
he
continue
,
as
they
sit
down
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
grandfather
have
come
round
after
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
,
about
Adam
?
"
  
"
yes
;
I
should
have
ride
over
to
tell
you
about
it
,
only
I
be
so
busy
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
tell
you
I
have
quite
give
up
argue
the
matter
with
him
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
hopeless
 
<EOS>
but
yesterday
morning
he
ask
me
to
come
in
here
to
him
before
I
go
out
,
and
astonish
me
by
say
that
he
have
decide
on
all
the
new
arrangement
he
should
make
in
consequence
of
old
Satchell
be
oblige
to
lay
by
work
,
and
that
he
intend
to
employ
Adam
in
superintend
the
wood
at
a
salary
of
a
guinea
a
-
week
,
and
the
use
of
a
pony
to
be
keep
here
.
<EOS>
I
believe
the
secret
of
it
be
,
he
see
from
the
first
it
would
be
a
profitable
plan
,
but
he
have
some
particular
dislike
of
Adam
to
get
over
 
and
besides
,
the
fact
that
I
propose
a
thing
be
generally
a
reason
with
him
for
reject
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
most
curious
contradiction
in
my
grandfather
:
I
know
he
mean
to
leave
me
all
the
money
he
have
save
,
and
he
be
likely
enough
to
have
cut
off
poor
Aunt
Lydia
,
who
have
be
a
slave
to
him
all
her
life
,
with
only
five
hundred
a
-
year
,
for
the
sake
of
give
me
all
the
more
;
and
yet
I
sometimes
think
he
positively
hate
me
because
I
be
his
heir
.
<EOS>
I
believe
if
I
be
to
break
my
neck
,
he
would
feel
it
the
great
misfortune
that
could
befall
him
,
and
yet
it
seem
a
pleasure
to
him
to
make
my
life
a
series
of
petty
annoyance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
my
boy
,
it
be
not
only
woman
's
love
that
be
[
two
greek
word
omit
]
as
old
AEschylus
call
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
plenty
of
"
unloving
love
"
in
the
world
of
a
masculine
kind
.
<EOS>
but
tell
me
about
Adam
.
<EOS>
have
he
accept
the
post
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
that
it
can
be
much
more
profitable
than
his
present
work
,
though
,
to
be
sure
,
it
will
leave
him
a
good
deal
of
time
on
his
own
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
feel
some
doubt
about
it
when
I
speak
to
him
<EOS>
and
he
seem
to
hesitate
at
first
.
<EOS>
His
objection
be
that
he
think
he
should
not
be
able
to
satisfy
my
grandfather
.
<EOS>
but
I
beg
him
as
a
personal
favour
to
me
not
to
let
any
reason
prevent
him
from
accept
the
place
,
if
he
really
like
the
employment
and
would
not
be
give
up
anything
that
be
more
profitable
to
him
.
<EOS>
and
he
assure
me
he
should
like
it
of
all
thing
 
<EOS>
it
would
be
a
great
step
forward
for
him
in
business
,
and
it
would
enable
him
to
do
what
he
have
long
wish
to
do
,
to
give
up
work
for
Burge
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
shall
have
plenty
of
time
to
superintend
a
little
business
of
his
own
,
which
he
and
Seth
will
carry
on
,
and
will
perhaps
be
able
to
enlarge
by
degree
.
<EOS>
so
he
have
agree
at
last
,
and
I
have
arrange
that
he
shall
dine
with
the
large
tenant
to
-
day
;
and
I
mean
to
announce
the
appointment
to
them
,
and
ask
them
to
drink
Adam
's
health
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
little
drama
I
have
get
up
in
honour
of
my
friend
Adam
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
fine
fellow
,
and
I
like
the
opportunity
of
let
people
know
that
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
a
drama
in
which
friend
Arthur
pique
himself
on
have
a
pretty
part
to
play
,
"
say
Mr.
Irwine
,
smile
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
see
Arthur
colour
,
he
go
on
relentingly
,
"
My
part
,
you
know
,
be
always
that
of
the
old
fogy
who
see
nothing
to
admire
in
the
young
folk
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
to
admit
that
I
be
proud
of
my
pupil
when
he
do
graceful
thing
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
play
the
amiable
old
gentleman
for
once
,
and
second
your
toast
in
honour
of
Adam
.
<EOS>
have
your
grandfather
yield
on
the
other
point
too
,
and
agree
to
have
a
respectable
man
as
steward
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
no
,
"
say
Arthur
,
rise
from
his
chair
with
an
air
of
impatience
and
walk
along
the
room
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
get
some
project
or
other
about
let
the
Chase
Farm
and
bargaining
for
a
supply
of
milk
and
butter
for
the
house
.
<EOS>
but
I
ask
no
question
about
it
 
<EOS>
it
make
me
too
angry
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
mean
to
do
all
the
business
himself
,
and
have
nothing
in
the
shape
of
a
steward
.
<EOS>
It
be
amazing
what
energy
he
have
,
though
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
we
will
go
to
the
lady
now
,
"
say
Mr.
Irwine
,
rise
too
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
tell
my
mother
what
a
splendid
throne
you
have
prepare
for
her
under
the
marquee
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
and
we
must
be
go
to
luncheon
too
,
"

Arthur
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
two
o'clock

there
be
the
gong
begin
to
sound
for

<EOS>
Dinner
-
Time
  
<EOS>
when
Adam
hear
that
he
be
to
dine
upstairs
with
the
large
tenant
,
he
feel
rather
uncomfortable
at
the
idea
of
be
exalt
in
this
way
above
his
mother
and
Seth
,
who
be
to
dine
in
the
cloister
below
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Mills
,
the
butler
,
assure
him
that
Captain
Donnithorne
have
give
particular
order
about
it
,
and
would
be
very
angry
if
Adam
be
not
there
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
nod
and
go
up
to
Seth
,
who
be

a

off

so
I
suppose

I

Adam

guest
invite
to
come
upstairs
on

than
the
amount

<EOS>
there
be
other
people
in

derive
dignity
from

of

Bartle

one

<EOS>
His

walk
be
rather
slow
than

so
Adam
linger
behind
when
the
bell
ring
for
dinner

that
he
may
walk
up
with
his
old

for

shy
to
join
the
Poyser
party
on

public
occasion

<EOS>
opportunity
of
get
to
Hetty

side
would
be
sure
to

up
in

Adam
mind
the
less
about
sit
by

because
this

enable

to

not

off

<EOS>
Hetty
,
however

have
not

notice
his

for
she
be
give
angry
attention
to
Totty

who
insist
on
draw
up
her
foot
on
to
the
bench
in
antique
fashion
,
and
thereby
threaten
to
make
dusty
mark

<EOS>
no
sooner
be
the
little
fat
leg
push
down
than
up
<EOS>
they
come
again

for
Totty
's
eye
be
too
busy
in
stare
at
the
large
dish
to
see
where
the
plum
pudding
be
for
her
to

any

Hetty
get
quite
out

at

,
with
a
frown

gather
tear

she
say
,
"

<EOS>
Adam
be
look
at
Hetty
,
and
see
the
frown
,

,
and
the
dark
eye
seem
to
grow
large
with
pettish
half
-
gather
tear

<EOS>
Quiet
Mary
Burge
,
who
sit
near
enough
to
see
that
Hetty
be
cross
and
that
Adam
's
eye
be
fix
on
her
,
think
that
so
sensible
a
man
as
Adam
must
be
reflect
on
the
small
value
of
beauty
in
a
woman
whose
temper
be
bad
.
<EOS>
Mary
be
a
good
girl
,
not
give
to
indulge
in
evil
feeling
,
but
she
say
to
herself
,
that
,
since
Hetty
have
a
bad
temper
,
it
be
well
Adam
should
know
it
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
quite
true
that
if
Hetty
have
be
plain
,
she
would
have
look
very
ugly
and
unamiable
at
that
moment
,
and
no
one
's
moral
judgment
upon
her
would
have
be
in
the
least
beguiled
.
<EOS>
but
really
there
be
something
quite
charming
in
her
pettishness
<EOS>
:
it
look
so
much
more
like
innocent
distress
than
ill
humour
;
and
the
severe
Adam
feel
no
movement
of
disapprobation
;
he
only
feel
a
sort
of
amused
pity
,
as
if
he
have
see
a
kitten
set
up
its
back
,
or
a
little
bird
with
its
feather
ruffle
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
gather
what
be
vex
her
,
but
it
be
impossible
to
him
to
feel
otherwise
than
that
she
be
the
pretty
thing
in
the
world
,
and
that
if
he
could
have
his
way
,
nothing
should
ever
vex
her
any
more
.
<EOS>
and
presently
,
when
Totty
be
go
,
she
catch
his
eye
,
and
her
face
break
into
one
of
its
bright
smile
,
as
she
nod
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
bit
of
flirtation
 
<EOS>
she
know
Mary
Burge
be
look
at
them
.
<EOS>
but
the
smile
be
like
wine
to
Adam

he
have
be
in

state

abstraction

with

of

he
be
fond
of

special

<EOS>
the
pleasure
he
feel

Hereupon
a

shouting

a
rapping

a
jingling

a
clattering

and
a
shouting

with
plentiful

pleasanter

Arthur
have
feel
a
twinge
of
conscience
during

it
be
too
feeble
to
nullify
the
pleasure
he
feel
in
be
praise

do
he
not
deserve
what

<EOS>
if
there
be
something
in
his
conduct
that
Poyser
would

like
if
he
have
know
it

why

no

conduct
will
bear
too
close
an
inspection

and
Poyser
be
not
likely
to
know
it
;
and
,
after
all
,
what
have
he
do
?
<EOS>
go
a
little
too
far
,
perhaps
,
in
flirtation
,
but
another
man
in
his
place
would
have
act
much
bad
;
and
no
harm
would
come
 
<EOS>
no
harm
should
come
,
for
the
next
time
he
be
alone
with
Hetty

he
would
explain
to
her
that
she
must
not
think
seriously
of
him

of
what
have
pass

It
be
necessary
to
Arthur

you
perceive

to
be
satisfied

himself

uncomfortable
thought
must
be
get
rid
of
by
good
intention
for
the

which
can
be
form
so
rapidly
that
he
have
time
to
be
uncomfortable

to
become
easy
again
before
Mr.

's
slow
speech
be
finish

I

for
the
good

and
the
kind
feeling
towards
me
which
Mr.

have
be
express
on
your
behalf
and
on
his
own
,
and
it
will
always
be
my
heartiest
wish
to
deserve
them
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
thing
we
may
expect
that
,
if
I
live
,
I
shall
one
day
or
other
be
your
landlord
;
indeed
,
it
be
on
the
ground
of
that
expectation
that
my
grandfather
have
wish
me
to
celebrate
this
day
and
to
come
among
you
now
;
and
I
look
forward
to
this
position
,
not
merely
as
one
of
power
and
pleasure
for
myself
,
but
as
a
means
of
benefit
my
neighbour
.
<EOS>
It
hardly
become
so
young
a
man
as
I
be
to
talk
much
about
farming
to
you
,
who
be
most
of
you
so
much
old
,
and
be
man
of
experience
;
still
,
I
have
interest
myself
a
good
deal
in
such
matter
,
and
learn
as
much
about
them
as
my
opportunity
have
allow
;
and
when
the
course
of
event
shall
place
the
estate
in
my
hand
,
it
will
be
my
first
desire
to
afford
my
tenant
all
the
encouragement
a
landlord
can
give
them
,
in
improve
their
land
and
try
to
bring
about
a
well
practice
of
husbandry
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
my
wish
to
be
look
on
by
all
my
deserve
tenant
as
their
good
friend
,
and
nothing
would
make
me
so
happy
as
to
be
able
to
respect
every
man
on
the
estate
,
and
to
be
respect
by
him
in
return
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
my
place
at
present
to
enter
into
particular
;
I
only
meet
your
good
hope
concern
me
by
tell
you
that
my
own
hope
correspond
to
them
 
that
what
you
expect
from
me
I
desire
to
fulfil
;
and
I
be
quite
of
Mr.
Poyser
's
opinion
,
that
when
a
man
have
say
what
he
mean
,
he
have
well
stop
.
<EOS>
but
the
pleasure
I
feel
in
have
my
own
health
drunk
by
you
would
not
be
perfect
if
we
do
not
drink
the
health
of
my
grandfather
,
who
have
fill
the
place
of
both
parent
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
say
no
more
,
until
you
have
join
me
in
drink
his
health
on
a
day
when
he
have
wish
me
to
appear
among
you
as
the
future
representative
of
his
name
and
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
perhaps
there
be
no
one
present
except
Mr.
Irwine
who
thoroughly
understand
and
approve
Arthur
's
graceful
mode
of
propose
his
grandfather
's
health

<EOS>
the
farmer
think
the
young
squire
know
well
enough
that
they
hate
the
old
squire
,
and
Mrs.
Poyser
say
,
"
he
would
better
not
ha
'
stir
a
kettle
o
'
sour
broth

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
bucolic
mind
do
not
readily
apprehend
the
refinement
of
good
taste

<EOS>
but
the
toast
could
not
be
reject
and
when
it
have
be
drunk
,
Arthur
say
,
"
I
thank
you
,
both
for
my

now
there
be
one
more
thing
I

every
one
in
this
neighbourhood
that
there
be
no
man
whose
word
can
be
more
depend
on
than
his
;
that
whatever
he
undertake
to
do
,
he
do
well
,
and
be
as
careful
for
the
interest
of
those
who
employ
him
as
for
his
own
.
<EOS>
I
be
proud
to
say
that
I
be
very
fond
of
Adam
when
I
be
a
little
boy
,
and
I
have
never
lose
my
old
feeling
for
him
 
<EOS>
I
think
that
show
that
I
know
a
good
fellow
when
I
find
him
.
<EOS>
It
have
long
be
my
wish
that
he
should
have
the
management
of
the
wood
on
the
estate
,
which
happen
to
be
very
valuable
,
not
only
because
I
think
so
highly
of
his
character
,
but
because
he
have
the
knowledge
and
the
skill
which
fit
him
for
the
place
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
happy
to
tell
you
that
it
be
my
grandfather
's
wish
too
,
and
it
be
now
settle
that
Adam
shall
manage
the
wood
 
a
change
which
I
be
sure
will
be
very
much
for
the
advantage
of
the
estate
;
and
I
hope
you
will
by
and
by
join
me
in
drink
his
health
,
and
in
wish
him
all
the
prosperity
in
life
that
he
deserve
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
still
old
friend
of
mine
than
Adam
Bede
present
,
and
I
need
not
tell
you
that
it
be
Mr.
Irwine
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
will
agree
with
me
that
we
must
drink
no
other
person
's
health
until
we
have
drink
his
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
have
all
reason
to
love
him
,
but
no
one
of
his
parishioner
have
so
much
reason
as
I.
Come
,
charge
your
glass
,
and
let
us
drink
to
our
excellent
rector
 
three
time
three
!
"
  
<EOS>
this
toast
be
drunk
with
all
the
enthusiasm
that
be
want
to
the
last
,
and
it
certainly
be
the
most
picturesque
moment
in
the
scene
when
Mr.
Irwine
get
up
to
speak
,
and
all
the
face
in
the
room
be
turn
towards
him
.
<EOS>
the
superior
refinement
of
his
face
be
much
more
striking
than
that
of
Arthur
's
when
see
in
comparison
with
the
people
round
them
.
<EOS>
Arthur
's
be
a
much
commoner
british
face
,
and
the
splendour
of
his
new
-
fashioned
clothe
be
more
akin
to
the
young
farmer
's
taste
in
costume
than
Mr.
Irwine
's
powder
and
the
well
-
brush
but
well
-
wear
black
,
which
seem
to
be
his
choose
suit
for
great
occasion
;
for
he
have
the
mysterious
secret
of
never
wear
a
new
-
look
coat
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
not
the
first
time
,
by
a
great
many
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
I
have
have
to
thank
my
parishioner
for
give
me
token
of
their
goodwill
,
but
neighbourly
kindness
be
among
those
thing
that
be
the
more
precious
the
old
they
get
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
our
pleasant
meeting
to
-
day
be
a
proof
that
when
what
be
good
come
of
age
and
be
likely
to
live
,
there
be
reason
for
rejoice
,
and
the
relation
between
us
as
clergyman
and
parishioner
come
of
age
two
year
ago
,
for
it
be
three
-
and
-
twenty
year
since
I
first
come
among
you
,
and
I
see
some
tall
fine
-
look
young
man
here
,
as
well
as
some
bloom
young
woman
,
that
be
far
from
look
as
pleasantly
at
me
when
I
christen
them
as
I
be
happy
to
see
them
look
now
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
sure
you
will
not
wonder
when
I
say
that
among
all
those
young
man
,
the
one
in
whom
I
have
the
strong
interest
be
my
friend
Mr.
Arthur
Donnithorne
,
for
whom
you
have
just
express
your
regard
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
pleasure
of
be
his
tutor
for
several
year
,
and
have
naturally
have
opportunity
of
know
him
intimately
which
can
not
have
occur
to
any
one
else
who
be
present
;
and
I
have
some
pride
as
well
as
pleasure
in
assure
you
that
I
share
your
high
hope
concern
him
,
and
your
confidence
in
his
possession
of
those
quality
which
will
make
him
an
excellent
landlord
when
the
time
shall
come
for
him
to
take
that
important
position
among
you
.
<EOS>
We
feel
alike
on
most
matter
on
which
a
man
who
be
get
towards
fifty
can
feel
in
common
with
a
young
man
of
one
-
and
-
twenty
,
and
he
have
just
be
express
a
feeling
which
I
share
very
heartily
,
and
I
would
not
willingly
omit
the
opportunity
of
say
so
.
<EOS>
that
feeling
be
his
value
and
respect
for
Adam
Bede
.
<EOS>
People
in
a
high
station
be
of
course
more
thought
of
and
talk
about
and
have
their
virtue
more
praised
,
than
those
whose
life
be
pass
in
humble
everyday
work
;
but
every
sensible
man
know
how
necessary
that
humble
everyday
work
be
,
and
how
important
it
be
to
us
that
it
should
be
do
well
.
<EOS>
and
I
agree
with
my
friend
Mr.
Arthur
Donnithorne
in
feel
that
when
a
man
whose
duty
lie
in
that
sort
of
work
show
a
character
which
would
make
him
an
example
in
any
station
,
his
merit
should
be
acknowledge
.
<EOS>
He
be
one
of
those
to
whom
honour
be
due
,
and
his
friend
should
delight
to
honour
him
.
<EOS>
I
know
Adam
Bede
<EOS>
well
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
he
be
as
a
workman
,
and
what
he
have
be
as
a
son
and
brother
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
say
the
simple
truth
when
I
say
that
I
respect
him
as
much
as
I
respect
any
man
live
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
speak
to
you
about
a
stranger
;
some
of
you
be
his
intimate
friend
,
and
I
believe
there
be
not
one
here
who
do
not
know
enough
of
him
to
join
heartily
in
drink
his
health
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
Mr.
Irwine
pause
,
Arthur
jump
up
and
,
fill
his
glass
,
say
,
"
a
bumper
to
Adam
Bede
,
and
may
he
live
to
have
son
as
faithful
and
clever
as
himself
!
"
  
<EOS>
no
hearer
,
not
even
Bartle
Massey
,
be
so
delighted
with
this
toast
as
Mr.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
tough
work
"
<EOS>
as
his
first
speech
have
be
,
he
would
have
start
up
to
make
another
if
he
have
not
know
the
extreme
irregularity
of
such
a
course
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
he
find
an
outlet
for
his
feeling
in
drink
his
ale
unusually
fast
,
and
set
down
his
glass
with
a
swing
of
his
arm
and
a
determined
rap
.
<EOS>
if
Jonathan
Burge
and
a
few
other
feel
less
comfortable
on
the
occasion
,
they
try
their
good
to
look
contented
,
and
so
the
toast
be
drunk
with
a
goodwill
apparently
unanimous
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
be
rather
paler
than
usual
when
he
get
up
to
thank
his
friend
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
good
deal
move
by
this
public
tribute
 
very
naturally
,
for
he
be
in
the
presence
of
all
his
little
world
,
and
it
be
unite
to
do
him
honour
.
<EOS>
but
he
feel
no
shyness
about
speak
,
not
be
trouble
with
small
vanity
or
lack
of
word
;
he
look
neither
awkward
nor
embarrassed
,
but
stand
in
his
usual
firm
upright
attitude
,
with
his
head
throw
a
little
backward
and
his
hand
perfectly
still
,
in
that
rough
dignity
which
be
peculiar
to
intelligent
,
honest
,
well
-
build
workman
,
who
be
never
wonder
what
be
their
business
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
take
by
surprise
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
expect
anything
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
this
sort
,
for
it
be
a
good
deal
more
than
my
wage
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
the
more
reason
to
be
grateful
to
you
,
Captain
,
and
to
you
,
Mr.
Irwine
,
and
to
all
my
friend
here
,
who
have
drink
my
health
and
wish
me
well
.
<EOS>
It
'
ud
be
nonsense
for
me
to
be
say
,
I
do
not
at
all
deserve
th
'
opinion
you
have
of
me
;
that
'
ud
be
poor
thank
to
you
,
to
say
that
you
have
know
me
all
these
year
and
yet
have
not
sense
enough
to
find
out
a
great
deal
o
'
the
truth
about
me
.
<EOS>
You
think
,
if
I
undertake
to
do
a
bit
o
'
work
,
I
will
do
it
well
<EOS>
,
be
my
pay
big
or
little
 
and
that
be
true
.
<EOS>
I
would
be
ashamed
to
stand
before
you
here
if
it
wasna
true
.
<EOS>
but
it
seem
to
me
that
be
a
man
's
plain
duty
,
and
nothing
to
be
conceite
about
,
and
it
be
pretty
clear
to
me
as
I
have
never
do
more
than
my
duty
;
for
let
us
do
what
we
will
,
it
be
only
make
use
o
'
the
sperrit
and
the
power
that
ha
'
be
give
to
us
.
<EOS>
and
so
this
kindness
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
your
,
I
be
sure
,
be
no
debt
you
owe
me
,
but
a
free
gift
,
and
as
such
I
accept
it
and
be
thankful
.
<EOS>
and
as
to
this
new
employment
I
have
take
in
hand
,
I
will
only
say
that
I
take
it
at
Captain
Donnithorne
's
desire
,
and
that
I
will
try
to
fulfil
his
expectation
.
<EOS>
I
would
wish
for
no
well
lot
than
to
work
under
him
,
and
to
know
that
while
I
be
get
my
own
bread
I
be
take
care
of
his
int'rests
.
<EOS>
for
I
believe
he
be
one
<EOS>
o
those
gentleman
as
wish
to
do
the
right
thing
,
and
to
leave
the
world
a
bit
better
than
he
find
it
,
which
it
be
my
belief
every
man
may
do
,
whether
he
be
gentle
or
simple
,
whether
he
set
a
good
bit
o
'
work
go
and
find
the
money
,
or
whether
he
do
the
work
with
his
own
hand
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
occasion
for
me
to
say
any
more
about
what
I
feel
towards
him
:
I
hope
to
show
it
through
the
rest
o
'
my
life
in
my
action
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
various
opinion
about
Adam
's
speech
:
some
of
the
woman
whisper
that
he
do
not
show
himself
thankful
enough
,
and
seem
to
speak
as
proud
as
could
be
;
but
most
of
the
man
be
of
opinion
that
nobody
could
speak
more
straightfor'ard
,
and
that
Adam
be
as
fine
a
chap
as
need
to
be
.
<EOS>
while
such
observation
be
be
buzz
about
,
mingle
with
wondering
as
to
what
the
old
squire
mean
to
do
for
a
bailiff
,
and
whether
he
be
go
to
have
a
steward
,
the
two
gentleman
have
rise
,
and
be
walk
round
to
the
table
where
the
wife
and
child
sit
.
<EOS>
there
be
none
of
the
strong
ale
here
,
of
course
,
but
wine
and
dessert
 
sparkle
gooseberry
for
the
young
one

and
some
good
sherry
for
the
mother
.

Mrs.

They

He
walk

Mr.

satisfy
himself
with

Arthur
do
not
venture

stop
near
Hetty

merely
bow
to
her

most
miserable

she
have

Arthur

so
near
to
her
only
a

be
separate
from

the

besides

there

with
their

the

donkey
by
hiss
,
while
the

apply
the
argument

<EOS>
but
the
strength
of
the
donkey
mind
lie
in
adopt
a
course
inversely
as

which

standstill
just
when

<EOS>
Great
be
the
shouting
of
the
crowd
,
radiant
the
grinning
of
Bill
Downes
the
stone

and
the
fortunate
rider
of
this
superior
beast

which
stand
calm

stiff

triumph

Arthur

splendid
pocket

knife

supply
with

enough

He
have
hardly
return
from
the

with
the
prize
in
his

when
it
begin
to
be
understand
that
Wiry
Ben
propose
to
amuse
the
company
,
before
the
gentry
go
to
dinner
,
with
an
impromptu
and
gratuitous
performance
 
namely
,
a
hornpipe
,
the
main
idea
of
which
be
doubtless
borrow
;
but
this
be
to
be
develop
by
the
dancer
in
so
peculiar
and
complex
a
manner
that
no
one
could
deny
him
the
praise
of
originality
.
<EOS>
Wiry
Ben
's
pride
in
his
dancing
 
an
accomplishment
productive
of
great
effect
at
the
yearly
Wake
 
have
need
only
slightly
elevate
by
an
extra
quantity
of
good
ale
to
convince
him
that
the
gentry
would
be
very
much
strike
with
his
performance
of
his
hornpipe
;
and
he
have
be
decidedly
encourage
in
this
idea
by
Joshua
Rann
,
who
observe
that
it
be
nothing
but
right
to
do
something
to
please
the
young
squire
,
in
return
for
what
he
have
do
for
them
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
the
less
surprised
at
this
opinion
in
so
grave
a
personage
when
you
learn
that
Ben
have
request
Mr.
Rann
to
accompany
him
on
the
fiddle
,
and
Joshua
feel
quite
sure
that
though
there
may
not
be
much
in
the
dancing
,
the
music
would
make
up
for
it
.
<EOS>
Adam
Bede
,
who
be
present
in
one
of
the
large
marquee
,
where
the
plan
be
be
discuss
,
tell
Ben
he
have
well
not
make
a
fool
of
himself
 
a
remark
which
at
once
fix
Ben
's
determination
:
he
be
not
go
to
let
anything
alone
because
Adam
Bede
turn
up
his
nose
at
it

<EOS>
Miss

assentingly

her
away
,
while
Joshua

preliminary
scraping
burst
into
the
"
White
Cockade
,
"
from
which
he
intend
to
pass
to
a
variety
of
tune
,
by
a
series
of
transition
which
his
good
ear
really
teach
him
to
execute
with
some
skill
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
an
exasperating
fact
to
him
,
if
he
have
know
it
,
that
the
general
attention
be
too
thoroughly
absorb
by
Ben
's
dancing
for
any
one
to
give
much
heed
to
the
music
.
  
<EOS>
have
you
ever
see
a
real
english
rustic
perform
a
solo
dance
?
<EOS>
perhaps
you
have
only
see
a
ballet
rustic
,
smile
like
a
merry
countryman
in
crockery
,
with
graceful
turn
of
the
haunch
and
insinuate
movement
of
the
head
.
<EOS>
that
be
as
much
like
the
real
thing
as
the
"
Bird
Waltz
"
be
like
the
song
of
bird
.
<EOS>
Wiry
Ben
never
smile
:
he
look
as
serious
as
a
dancing
monkey
 
as
serious
as
if
he
have
be
an
experimental
philosopher
ascertain
in
his
own
person
the
amount
of
shaking
and
<EOS>
the
variety
of
angularity
that
could
be
give
to
the
human
limb

make
amend

the
abundant
laughter
in

Arthur
clap
his

continually

cry
"
Bravo

<EOS>
but
Ben
have
one
admirer
whose
eye
follow
his
movement
with
a
fervid
gravity
that
equal
his
own

<EOS>
It
be
Martin

<EOS>
the
Dance
  
ARTHUR
have
choose
the
entrance
-
hall
for
the
ballroom
:
very
wisely
,
for
no
other
room
could
have
be
so
airy
,
or
would
have
have
the
advantage
of
the
wide
door
open
into
the
garden
,
as
well
as
a
ready
entrance
into
the
other
room
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
a
stone
floor
be
not
the
pleasantest
to
dance
on
,
but
then
,
most
of
the
dancer
have
know
what
it
be
to
enjoy
a
Christmas
dance
on
kitchen
quarry
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
those
entrance
-
hall
which
make
the
surround
room
look
like
closet
 
with
stucco
angel
,
trumpet
,
and
flower
-
wreath
on
the
lofty
ceiling
,
and
great
medallion
of
miscellaneous
hero
on
the
wall
,
alternate
with
statue
in
niche
.
<EOS>
just
the
sort
of
place
to
be
ornament
well
with
green
bough
,
and
Mr.
Craig
have
be
proud
to
show
his
taste
and
his
hothouse
plant
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
the
broad
step
of
the
stone
staircase
be
cover
with
cushion
to
serve
as
seat
for
the
child
,
who
be
to
stay
till
half
-
past
nine
with
the
servant
-
maid
to
see
the
dancing
,
and
as
this
dance
be
confine
to
the
chief
tenant
,
there
be
abundant
room
for
every
one
.
<EOS>
the
light
be
charmingly
dispose
in
colour
-
paper
lamp
,
high
up
among
green
bough
,
and
the
farmer
'
wife
and
daughter
,
as
they
peep
in
,
believe
no
scene
could
be
more
splendid
;
they
know
now
quite
well
in
what
sort
of
room
the
king
and
queen
live
,
and
their
thought
glance
with
some
pity
towards
cousin
and
acquaintance
who
have
not
this
fine
opportunity
of
know
how
thing
go
on
in
the
great
world
.
<EOS>
the
lamp
be
already
light
,
though
the
sun
have
not
long
set
,
and
there
be
that
calm
light
out
of
door
in
which
we
seem
to
see
all
object
more
distinctly
than
in
the
broad
day
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
pretty
scene
outside
the
house
:
the
farmer
and
their
family
be
move
about
the
lawn
,
among
the
flower
and
shrub
,
or
along
the
broad
straight
road
lead
from
the
east
front
,
where
a
carpet
of
mossy
grass
spread
on
each
side
,
stud
here
and
there
with
a
dark
flat
-
boughed
cedar
,
or
a
grand
pyramidal
fir
sweep
the
ground
with
its
branch
,
all
tip
with
a
fringe
of
paler
green
.
<EOS>
the
group
of
cottager
in
the
park
be
gradually
diminish
,
the
young
one
be
attract
towards
the
light
that
be
begin
to
gleam
from
the
window
of
the
gallery
in
the
abbey
,
which
be
to
be
their
dancing
-
room
,
and
some
of
the
sober
eld
one
think
it
time
to
go
home
quietly
.
<EOS>
one
of
these
be
Lisbeth
Bede
,
and
Seth
go
with
her
 
not
from
filial
attention
only
,
for
his
conscience
would
not
let
him
join
in
dancing
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
rather
a
melancholy
day
to
Seth
:
<EOS>
Dinah
have
never
be
more
constantly
present
with
him
than
in
this
scene
,
where
everything
be
so
unlike
her
.
<EOS>
He
see
her
all
the
more
vividly
after
look
at
the
thoughtless
face
and
gay
-
coloured
dress
of
the
young
woman
 
just
as
one
feel
the
beauty
and
the
greatness
of
a
picture
Madonna
the
more
when
it
have
be
for
a
moment
screen
from
us
by
a
vulgar
head
in
a
bonnet
.
<EOS>
but
this
presence
of
Dinah
in
his
mind
only
help
him
to
bear
the
well
with
his
mother
's
mood
,
which
have
be
become
more
and
more
querulous
for
the
last
hour
.
<EOS>
Poor
Lisbeth
be
suffer
from
a
strange
conflict
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
Her
joy
and
pride
in
the
honour
pay
to
her
darle
son
Adam
be
begin
to
be
worst
in
the
conflict
with
the
jealousy
and
fretfulness
which
have
revive
when
Adam
come
to
tell
her
that
Captain
Donnithorne
desire
him
to
join
the

Adam

more
out

she
wish
all

<EOS>
Adam
feel
the
justice

Mr.

observation

it
would
not

for
him
to
dance
with
no

besides
Hetty

remember
that
Jonathan

have
some

he
resolve

when
they
have
enter
the
hall

and
the
three
child
under
Molly

Arthur
have
put

,
who
think
as
much
of
his

dignity
as
if
it
have
be
an
elevation
to
the
premiership

<EOS>
He
have
not
the
least
objection
to
gratify
them
in
that
way

his

be
very
advantageous
to
his
figure

the

before
sit
down
,
walk
round
the
hall
to
greet
the
tenant

make
polite
speech
to
the

he
be
always
polite
;
but
the
farmer
have
find
out
,
after
long
puzzling
,
that
this
polish
be
one
of
the
sign
of
hardness

<EOS>
It
be
observe
that
he
give
his
most
elaborate
civility
to
Mrs.
Poyser
to

night
,
inquire
particularly
about

recommend

Mrs.

curtsy

Mr.

up

,
"

come

you
must

take
you
to
my
aunt

for

claim
you
as

partner

"
  
<EOS>
the
wife
's
pale
cheek
flush
with
a
nervous
sense
of
unwonted
honour
as
Arthur
lead
her
to
the
top
of
the
room
;
but
Mr.
Poyser
,
to
whom
an
extra
glass
have
restore
his
youthful
confidence
in
his
good
look
and
good
dancing
,
walk
along
with
them
quite
proudly
,
secretly
flatter
himself
that
Miss
Lydia
have
never
have
a
partner
in
her
life
who
could
lift
her
off
the
ground
as
he
would
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
balance
the
honour
give
to
the
two
parish
,
Miss
Irwine
dance
with
Luke
Britton
,
the
large
Broxton
farmer
,
and
Mr.
Gawaine
lead
out
Mrs.
Britton
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
,
after
seat
his
sister
Anne
,
have
go
to
the
abbey
gallery
,
as
he
have
agree
with
Arthur
beforehand
,
to
see
how
the
merriment
of
the
cottager
be
prosper
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
all
the
less
distinguished
couple
have
take
their
place
:
Hetty
be
lead
out
by
the
inevitable
Mr.
Craig
,
and
Mary
Burge
by
Adam
;
and
now
the
music
strike
up
,
and
the
glorious
country
-
dance
,
good
of
all
dance
,
begin
.
  
<EOS>
pity
it
be
not
a
board
floor
!
<EOS>
then
the
rhythmic
stamping
of
the
thick
shoe
would
have
be
well
than
any
drum
.
<EOS>
that
merry
stamp
<EOS>
,
that
gracious
nodding
of
the
head
,
that
wave
bestowal
of
the
hand
 
where
can
we
see
them
now
?
<EOS>
that
simple
dancing
of
well
-
cover
matron
,
lay
aside
for
an
hour
the
care
of
house
and
dairy
,
remember
but
not
affect
youth
,
not
jealous
but
proud
of
the
young
maiden
by
their
side
 
<EOS>
that
holiday
sprightliness
of
portly
husband
pay
little
compliment
to
their
wife
,
as
if
their
courting
day
be
come
again
 
<EOS>
those
lad
and
lasse
a
little
confused
and
awkward
with
their
partner
,
have
nothing
to
say
 
it
would
be
a
pleasant
variety
to
see
all
that
sometimes
,
instead
of
low
dress
and
large
skirt
,
and
scanning
glance
explore
costume
,
and
languid
man
in
lacquered
boot
smile
with
double
meaning
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
but
one
thing
to
mar
Martin
Poyser
's
pleasure
in
this
dance
:
<EOS>
it
be
that
he
be
always
in
close
contact
with
Luke
Britton
,
that
slovenly
farmer
.
<EOS>
He
think
of
throw
a
little
glaze
coldness
into
his
eye
in
the
crossing
of
hand
;
but
then
,
as
Miss
Irwine
be
opposite
to
him
instead
of
the
offensive
Luke
,
he
may
freeze
the
wrong
person
.
<EOS>
so
he
give
his
face
up
to
hilarity
,
unchille
by
moral
judgment
.
  
<EOS>
how
Hetty
's
heart
beat
as
Arthur
approach
her
!
<EOS>
He
have
hardly
look
at
her
to
-
day
:
now
he
must
take
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Would
he
press
it
?
<EOS>
Would
he
look
at
her
?
<EOS>
She
think
she
would
cry
if
he
give
her
no
sign
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
now
he
be
there
 
<EOS>
he
have
take
her
hand
 
<EOS>
yes
,
he
be
press
it
.
<EOS>
Hetty
turn
pale
as
she
look
up
at
him
for
an
instant
and
meet
his
eye
,
before
the
dance
carry
him
away
.
<EOS>
that
pale
look
come
upon
Arthur
like
the
beginning
of
a
dull
pain
,
which
cling
to
him
,
though
he
must
dance
and
smile
and
joke
all
the
same
.
<EOS>
Hetty
would
look
so
,
when
he
tell
her
what
he
have
to
tell
her
;
and
he
should
never
be
able
to
bear
it
 
<EOS>
he
should
be
a
fool
and
give
way
again
.
<EOS>
Hetty
's
look
do
not
really
mean
so
much
as
he
think
:
it
be
only
the
sign
of
a
struggle
between
the
desire
for
him
to
notice
her
and
the
dread
lest
she
should
betray
the
desire
to
other
.
<EOS>
but
Hetty
's
face
have
a
language
that
transcend
her
feeling
.
<EOS>
there
be
face
which
nature
charge
with
a
meaning
and
pathos
not
belong
to
the
single
human
soul
that
flutter
beneath
them
,
but
speak
the
joy
and
sorrow
of
foregone
generation
 
eye
that
tell
of
deep
love
which
doubtless
have
be
and
be
somewhere
,
but
not
pair
with
these
eye
 
perhaps
pair
with
pale
eye
that
can
say
nothing
;
just
as
a
national
language
may
be
instinct
with
poetry
unfelt
by
the
lip
that
use
it
.
<EOS>
that
look
of
Hetty
's
oppress
Arthur
with
a
dread
which
yet
have
something
of
a
terrible
unconfessed
delight
in
it
,
that
she
love
him
too
well
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
hard
task
before
him
,
for
at
that
moment
he
feel
he
would
have
give
up
three
year
of
his
youth
for
the
happiness
of
abandon
himself
without
remorse
to
his
passion
for
Hetty
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
the
incongruous
thought
in
his
mind
as
he
lead
Mrs.
Poyser
,
who
be
pant
with
fatigue
,
and
secretly
resolve
that
neither
judge
nor
jury
should
force
her
to
dance
another
dance
,
to
take
a
quiet
rest
in
the
dining
-
room
,
where
supper
be
lay
out
for
the
guest
to
come
and
take
it
as
they
choose
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
desire
Hetty
to
remember
as
she
be
get
to
dance
wi
'
you
,
sir
,
"
say
the
good
innocent
woman
;
"
for
she
be
so
thoughtless
,
she
would
be
like
enough
to
go
an
'
engage
herself
for
ivery
dance
.
<EOS>
so
I
tell
her
not
to
promise
too
many
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
Mrs.
Poyser
,
"
say
Arthur
,
not
without
a
twinge
.
<EOS>
"
now
,
sit
down
in
this
comfortable
chair
,
and
here
be
mill
ready
to
give
you
what
you
would
like
good
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
hurry
away
to
seek
another
matronly
partner
,
for
due
honour
must
be
pay
to
the
married
woman
before
he
ask
any
of
the
young
one
;
and
the
country
-
dance
,
and
the
stamping
,
and
the
gracious
nodding
,
and
the
waving
of
the
hand
,
go
on
joyously
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
the
time
have
come
for
the
fourth
dance
 
long
for
by
the
strong
,
grave
Adam
,
as
if
he
have
be
a
delicate
-
handed
youth
of
eighteen
;
for
we
be
all
very
much
alike
when
we
be
in
our
first
love
;
and
Adam
have
hardly
ever
touch
Hetty
's
hand
for
more
than
a
transient
greeting
 
have
never
dance
with
her
but
once
before
.
<EOS>
His
eye
have
follow
her
eagerly
to
-
night
in
spite
of
himself
,
and
have
take
in
deep
draught
of
love
.
<EOS>
He
think
she
behave
so
prettily
,
so
quietly
;
she
do
not
seem
to
be
flirt
at
all
she
smile
less
than
usual
;
there
be
almost
a
sweet
sadness
about
her
.
"
<EOS>
God
bless
her
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
inwardly
;
"
I
would
make
her
life
a
happy
'
un
,
if
a
strong
arm
to
work
for
her
,
and
a
heart
to
love
her
,
could
do
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
there
steal
over
him
delicious
thought
of
come
home
from
work
,
and
draw
Hetty
to
his
side
,
and
feel
her
cheek
softly
press
against
his
,
till
he
forget
where
he
be
,
and
the
music
and
the
tread
of
foot
may
have
be
the
falling
of
rain
and
the
roaring
of
the
wind
,
for
what
he
know
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
the
third
dance
be
end
,
and
he
may
go
up
to
her
and
claim
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
be
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
near
the
staircase
,
whisper
with
Molly
,
<EOS>
who
have
just
give
the
sleep
Totty
into
her
arm
before
run
to
fetch
shawl
and
bonnet
from
the
landing
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
have
take
the
two
boy
away
into
the
dining
-
room
to
give
them
some
cake
before
they
go
home
in
the
cart
with
Grandfather
and
Molly
be
to
follow
as
fast
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
hold
her
,
"
say
Adam
,
as
Molly
turn
upstairs
;
"
the
child
be
so
heavy
when
they
be
asleep
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
be
glad
of
the
relief
,
for
to
hold
Totty
in
her
arm
,
standing
,
be
not
at
all
a
pleasant
variety
to
her
.
<EOS>
but
this
second
transfer
have
the
unfortunate
effect
of
rouse
Totty
,
who
be
not
behind
any
child
of
her
age
in
peevishness
at
an
unseasonable
awaking
.
<EOS>
while
Hetty
be
in
the
act
of
place
her
in
Adam
's
arm
,
and
have
not
yet
withdraw
her
own
,
Totty
open
her
eye
,
and
forthwith
fight
out
with
her
left
fist
at
Adam
's
arm
,
and
with
her
right
catch
at
the
string
of
brown
bead
round
Hetty
's
neck
.
<EOS>
the
locket
leap
out
from
her
frock
,
and
the
next
moment
the
string
be
break
,
and
Hetty
,
helpless
,
see
bead
and
locket
scatter
wide
on
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
locket
,
my
locket
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
in
a
loud
frightened
whisper
to
Adam
;
"
never
mind
the
bead
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
have
already
see
where
the
locket
fall
,
for
it
have
attract
his
glance
as
it
leap
out
of
her
frock
.
<EOS>
It
have
fall
on
the
raise
wooden
dai
where
the
band
sit
,
not
on
the
stone
floor
;
and
as
Adam
pick
it
up
,
he
see
the
glass
with
the
dark
and
light
lock
of
hair
under
it
.
<EOS>
It
have
fall
that
side
upwards
,
so
the
glass
be
not
break
.
<EOS>
He
turn
it
over
on
his
hand
,
and
see
the
enamel
gold
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
hurt
,
"
he
say
,
as
he
hold
it
towards
Hetty
,
who
be
unable
to
take
it
because
both
her
hand
be
occupy
with

<EOS>
"
oh
,
it
do
not
matter
,
I
do
not
mind
about
it
,
"
say
Hetty
,
who
have
be
pale
and
be
now
red
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
matter
?
"
say
Adam
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
You
seem
very
frightened
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
hold
it
till
you
be
ready
to
take
it
,
"
he
add
,
quietly
close
his
hand
over
it
,
that
she
may
not
think
he
want
to
look
at
it
again
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
Molly
have
come
with
bonnet
and
shawl
,
and
as
soon
as
she
have
take
Totty
,
Adam
place
the
locket
in
Hetty
's
hand
.
<EOS>
She
take
it
with
an
air
of
indifference
and
put
it
in
her
pocket
,
in
her
heart
vex
and
angry
with
Adam
because
he
have
see
it
,
but
determine
now
that
she
would
show
no
more
sign
of
agitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
see
,
"
she
say
,
"
they
be
take
their
place
to
dance
;
let
us
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
assent
silently
.
<EOS>
a
puzzled
alarm
have
take
possession
of
him
.
<EOS>
have
Hetty
a
lover
he
do
not
know
of
?
<EOS>
for
none
of
her
relation
,
he
be
sure
,
would
give
her
a
locket
like
that
;
and
none
of
her
admirer
,
with
whom
he
be
acquaint
,
be
in
the
position
of
an
accepted
lover
,
as
the
giver
of
that
locket
must
be
.
<EOS>
Adam
be
lose
in
the
utter
impossibility
of
find
any
person
for
his
fear
to
alight
on
.
<EOS>
He
could
only
feel
with
a
terrible
pang
that
there
be
something
in
Hetty
's
life
unknown
to
him
;
that
while
he
have
be
rock
himself
in
the
hope
that
she
would
come
to
love
him
,
she
be
already
love
another
.
<EOS>
the
pleasure
of
the
dance
with
Hetty
be
go
;
his
eye
,
when
they
rest
on
her
,
have
an
uneasy
questioning
expression
in
them
;
he
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
to
her
;
and
she
too
be
out
of
temper
and
disincline
to
speak
.
<EOS>
They
be
both
glad
when
the
dance
be
end
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
be
determined
to
stay
no
longer
;
no
one
want
him
,
and
no
one
would
notice
if
he
slip
away
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
get
out
of
door
,
he
begin
to
walk
at
his
habitual
rapid
pace
,
hurry
along
without
know
why
,
busy
with
the
painful
thought
that
the
memory
of
this
day
,
so
full
of
honour
and
promise
to
him
,
be
poison
for
ever
.
<EOS>
suddenly
,
when
he
be
far
on
through
the
Chase
,
he
stop
,
startle
by
a
flash
of
revive
hope
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
he
may
be
a
fool
,
make
a
great
misery
out
of
a
trifle
.
<EOS>
Hetty
,
fond
of
finery
as
she
be
,
may
have
buy
the
thing
herself
.
<EOS>
It
look
too
expensive
for
that
 
<EOS>
it
look
like
the
thing
on
white
satin
in
the
great
jeweller
's
shop
at
Rosseter
.
<EOS>
but
Adam
have
very
imperfect
notion
of
the
value
of
such
thing
,
and
he
think
it
could
certainly
not
cost
more
than
a
guinea
.
<EOS>
perhaps
Hetty
have
have
as
much
as
that
in
Christmas
box
,
and
there
be
no
knowing
<EOS>
but
she
may
have
be
childish
enough
to
spend
it
in
that
way
;
she
be
such
a
young
thing
,
and
she
could
not
help
love
finery
!
<EOS>
but
then
,
why
have
she
be
so
frightened
about
it
at
first
,
and
change
colour
so
,
and
afterwards
pretend
not
to
care
?
<EOS>
oh
,
that
be
because
she
be
ashamed
of
his
seeing
that
she
have
such
a
smart
thing
 
<EOS>
she
be
conscious
that
it
be
wrong
for
her
to
spend
her
money
on
it
,
and
she
know
that
Adam
disapprove
of
finery
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
proof
she
care
about
what
he
like
and
dislike
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
think
from
his
silence
and
gravity
afterwards
that
he
be
very
much
displeased
with
her
,
that
he
be
incline
to
be
harsh
and
severe
towards
her
foible
.
<EOS>
and
as
he
walk
on
more
quietly
,
chew
the
cud
of
this
new
hope
,
his
only
uneasiness
be
that
he
have
behave
in
a
way
which
may
chill
Hetty
's
feeling
towards
him
.
<EOS>
for
this
last
view
of
the
matter
must
be
the
true
one
.
<EOS>
how
could
Hetty
have
an
accepted
lover
,
quite
unknown
to
him
?
<EOS>
She
be
never
away
from
her
uncle
's
house
for
more
than
a
day
;
she
could
have
no
acquaintance
that
do
not
come
there
,
and
no
intimacy
unknown
to
her
uncle
and
aunt
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
folly
to
believe
that
the
locket
be
give
to
her
by
a
lover
.
<EOS>
the
little
ring
of
dark
hair
he
feel
sure
be
her
own
;
he
could
form
no
guess
about
the
light
hair
under
it
,
for
he
have
not
see
it
very
distinctly
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
a
bit
of
her
father
's
or
mother
's
,
who
have
die
when
she
be
a
child
,
and
she
would
naturally
put
a
bit
of
her
own
along
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
Adam
go
to
bed
comfort
,
have
weave
for
himself
an
ingenious
web
of
probability
 
the
sure
screen
a
wise
man
can
place
between
himself
and
the
truth
.
<EOS>
His
last
wake
thought
melt
into
a
dream
that
he
be
with
Hetty
again
at
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
that
he
be
ask
her
to
forgive
him
for
be
so
cold
and
silent
.
  
<EOS>
and
while
he
be
dream
this
,
Arthur
be
lead
Hetty
to
the
dance
and
say
to
her
in
low
hurried
tone
,
"
I
shall
be
in
the
wood
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
at
seven
;
come
as
early
as
you
can
.
"
<EOS>
and
Hetty
's
foolish
joy
and
hope
,
which
have
fly
away
for
a
little
space
,
scare
by
a
mere
nothing
,
now
all
come
flutter
back
,
unconscious
of
the
real
peril
.
<EOS>
She
be
happy
for
the
first
time
this
long
day
,
and
wish
that
dance
would
last
for
hour
.
<EOS>
Arthur
wish
it
too
;
it
be
the
last
weakness
he
mean
to
indulge
in
;
and
a
man
never
lie
with
more
delicious
languor
under
the
influence
of
a
passion
than
when
he
have
persuade
himself
that
he
shall
subdue
it
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Poyser
's
wish
be
quite
the
reverse
of
this
,
for
her
mind
be
fill
with
dreary
foreboding
as
to
the
retardation
of
to
-
morrow
morning
's
cheese
in
consequence
of
these
late
hour
.
<EOS>
now
that
Hetty
have
do
her
duty
and
dance
one
dance
with
the
young
squire
,
Mr.
Poyser
must
go
out
and
see
if
the
cart
be
come
back
to
fetch
them
,
for
it
be
half
-
past
ten
o'clock
,
and
notwithstanding
a
mild
suggestion
on
his
part
that
it
would
be
bad
manner
for
them
to
be
the
first
to
go
,
Mrs.
Poyser
be
resolute
on
the
point
,
"
manner
or
no
manner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what

<EOS>
go
already

Mrs.
Poyser
?

"
say
old
Mr.
Donnithorne
,
as
she
come
to
curtsy
and
take
leave
;
"
I
think
we
should
not
part

<EOS>
Mrs.
Irwine
and
I
,
who
be

"
  
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
a
crisis
  
<EOS>
it
be
beyond
the
middle
of
August
 
nearly
three
week
after
the
birthday
feast
.
<EOS>
the
reaping
of
the
wheat
have
begin
in
our
north
midland
county
of
Loamshire
,
but
the
harvest
be
likely
still
to
be
retard
by
the
heavy
rain
,
which
be
cause
inundation
and
much
damage
throughout
the
country
.
<EOS>
from
this
last
trouble
the
Broxton
and
Hayslope
farmer
,
on
their
pleasant
upland
and
in
their
brook
-
water
valley
,
have
not
suffer
,
and
as
I
can
not
pretend
that
they
be
such
exceptional
farmer
as
to
love
the
general
good
better
than
their
own
,
you
will
infer
that
they
be
not
in
very
low
spirit
about
the
rapid
rise
in
the
price
of
bread
,
so
long
as
there
be
hope
of
gather
in
their
own
corn
undamaged
;
and
occasional
day
of
sunshine
and
dry
wind
flatter
this
hope
.
  
<EOS>
the
eighteenth
of
August
be
one
of
these
day
when
the
sunshine
look
bright
in
all
eye
for
the
gloom
that
go
before
.
<EOS>
grand
masse
of
cloud
be
hurry
across
the
blue
,
and
the
great
round
hill
behind
the
Chase
seem
alive
with
their
fly
shadow
;
the
sun
be
hide
for
a
moment
,
and
then
shine
out
warm
again
like
a
recovered
joy
;
the
leave
,
still
green
,
be
toss
off
the
hedgerow
tree
by
the
wind
;
around
the
farmhouse
there
be
a
sound
of
clap
door
;
the
apple
fall
in
the
orchard
;
and
the
stray
horse
on
the
green
side
of
the
lane
and
on
the
common
have
their
mane
blow
about
their
face
.
<EOS>
and
yet
the
wind
seem
only
part
of
the
general
gladness
because
the
sun
be
shine
.
<EOS>
a
merry
day
for
the
child
,
who
run
and
shout
to
see
if
they
could
top
the
wind
with
their
voice
;
and
the
grown
-
up
people
too
be
in
good
spirit
,
incline
to
believe
in
yet
fine
day
,
when
the
wind
have
fall
.
<EOS>
if
only
the
corn
be
not
ripe
enough
to
be
blow
out
of
the
husk
and
scatter
as
untimely
seed
!
  
<EOS>
and
yet
a
day
on
which
a
blighting
sorrow
may
fall
upon
a
man
.
<EOS>
for
if
it
be
true
that
Nature
at
certain
moment
seem
charge
with
a
presentiment
of
one
individual
lot
must
it
not
also
be
true
that
she
seem
unmindful
unconscious
of
another
?
<EOS>
for
there
be
no
hour
that
have
not
its
birth
of
gladness
and
despair
,
no
morning
brightness
that
do
not
bring
new
sickness
to
desolation
as
well
as
new
force
to
genius
and
love
.
<EOS>
there
be
so
many
of
us
,
and
our
lot
be
so
different
,
<EOS>
what
wonder
that
Nature
's
mood
be
often
in
harsh
contrast
with
the
great
crisis
of
our
life
?
<EOS>
We
be
child
of
a
large
family
,
and
must
learn
,
<EOS>
as
such
child
do
,
not
to
expect
that
our
hurt
will
be
make
much
of
 
to
be
content
with
little
nurture
and
caress
,
and
help
each
other
the
more
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
busy
day
with
Adam
,
who
of
late
have
do
almost
double
work
,
for
he
be
continue
to
act
as
foreman
for
Jonathan
Burge
,
until
some
satisfactory
person
could
be
find
to
supply
his
place
,
and
Jonathan
be
slow
to
find
that
person
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
do
the
extra
work
cheerfully
,
for
his
hope
be
buoyant
again
about
Hetty
.
<EOS>
every
time
she
have
see
him
since
the
birthday
,
she
have
seem
to
make
an
effort
to
behave
all
the
more
kindly
to
him
,
that
she
may
make
him
understand
she
have
forgive
his
silence
and
coldness
during
the
dance
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
mention
the
locket
to
her
again
;
too
happy
that
she
smile
at
him
 
still
happy
because
he
observe
in
her
a
more
subdued
air
,
something
that
he
interpret
as
the
growth
of
womanly
tenderness
and
seriousness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
think
,
again
and
again
,
"
she
be
only
seventeen
;
she
will
be
thoughtful
enough
after
a
while
.
<EOS>
and
her
aunt
allays
say
how
clever
she
be
at
the
work
.
<EOS>
She
will
make
a
wife
as
Mother'll
have
no
occasion
to
grumble
at
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
,
he
have
only
see
her
at
home
twice
since
the
birthday
;
for
one
Sunday
,
when
he
be
intend
to
go
from
church
to
the
Hall
Farm
,
Hetty
have
join
the
party
of
upper
servant
from
the
Chase
and
have
go
home
with
them
 
almost
as
if
she
be
incline
to
encourage
Mr.
Craig
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
takin
'
too
much
likin

folk

the

Mrs.
Poyser
remark

"
for
my
part

I
be
never
overfond

<EOS>
they
be
mostly
like
the
fine
lady
'
fat
dog
,
nayther
good
for
barking
nor
butcher
's
meat
,
but
on'y
for
show
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
another
evening
she
be
go
to
Treddleston
to
buy
some
thing
;
though
,
to
his
great
surprise
,
as
he
be
return
home
,
he
see
her
at
a
distance
get
over
a
stile
quite
out
of
the
Treddleston
road
.
<EOS>
but
,
when
he
hasten
to
her
,
she
be
very
kind
,
and
ask
him
to
go
in
again
when
he
have
take
her
to
the
yard
gate
.
<EOS>
She
have
go
a
little
farther
into
the
field
after
come
from
Treddleston
because
she
do
not
want
to
go
in
<EOS>
,
she
say
:
it
be
so
nice
to
be
out
of
door
,
and
her
aunt
always
make
such
a
fuss
about
it
if
she
want
to
go
out
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
do
come
in
with
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
as
he
be
go
to
shake
hand
with
her
at
the
gate
,
and
he
could
not
resist
that
.
<EOS>
so
he
go
in
,
and
Mrs.
Poyser
be
content
with
only
a
slight
remark
on
Hetty
's
be
later
than
be
expect
;
while
Hetty
,
who
have
look
out
of
spirit
when
he
meet
her
,
smile
and
talk
and
wait
on
them
all
with
unusual
promptitude
.
  
<EOS>
that
be
the
last
time
he
have
see
her
;
but
he
mean
to
make
leisure
for
go
to
the
Farm
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
to
-
day
,
he
know
,
be
her
day
for
go
to
the
Chase
to
sew
with
the
lady
's
maid
,
so
he
would
get
as
much
work
do
as
possible
this
evening
,
that
the
next
may
be
clear
.
  
<EOS>
one
piece
of
work
that
Adam
be
superintend
be
some
slight
repair
at
the
Chase
Farm
,
which
have
be
hitherto
occupy
by
Satchell
,
as
bailiff
,
but
<EOS>
which
it
be
now
rumour
that
the
old
squire
be
go
to
let
to
a
smart
man
in
top
-
boot
,
who
have
be
see
to
ride
over
it
one
day
.
<EOS>
nothing
but
the
desire
to
get
a
tenant
could
account
for
the
squire
's
undertaking
repair
,
though
the
Saturday
-
evening
party
at
Mr.
Casson
's
agree
over
their
pipe
that
no
man
in
his
sense
would
take
the
Chase
Farm
unless
there
be
a
bit
more
ploughland
lay
to
it
.
<EOS>
however
that
may
be
,
the
repair
be
order
to
be
execute
with
all
dispatch
,
and
Adam
,
act
for
Mr.
Burge
,
be
carry
out
the
order
with
his
usual
energy
.
<EOS>
but
to
-
day
,
have
be
occupy
elsewhere
,
he
have
not
be
able
to
arrive
at
the
Chase
Farm
till
late
in
the
afternoon
,
and
he
then
discover
that
some
old
roofing
,
which
he
have
calculate
on
preserving
,
have
give
way
.
<EOS>
there
be
clearly
no
good
to
be
do
with
this
part
of
the
building
without
pull
it
all
down
,
and
Adam
immediately
see
in
his
mind
a
plan
for
build
it
up
again
,
so
as
to
make
the
most
convenient
of
cow
-
shed
and
calf
-
pen
,
with
a
hovel
for
implement
;
and
all
without
any
great
expense
for
material
.
<EOS>
so
,
when
the
workman
be
go
,
he
sit
down
,
take
out
his
pocket
-
book
,
and
busy
himself
with
sketch
a
plan
,
and
make
a
specification
of
the
expense
that
he
may
show
it
to
burge
the
next
morning
,
and
set
him
on
persuade
the
squire
to
consent
.
<EOS>
to
"
make
a
good
job
"
of
anything
,
however
small
,
be
always
a
pleasure
to
Adam
,
and
he
sit
on
a
block
,
with
his
book
rest
on
a
planing
-
table
,
whistle
low
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
and
turn
his
head
on
one
side
with
a
just
perceptible
smile
of
gratification
 
of
pride
,
too
,
<EOS>
for
if
Adam
love
a
bit
of
good
work
,
he
love
also
to
think
,
"
I
do
it
!
"
<EOS>
and
I
believe
the
only
people
who
be
free
from
that
weakness
be
those
who
have
no
work
to
call
their
own
.
<EOS>
It
be
nearly
seven
before
he
have
finish
and
put
on
his
jacket
again
;
and
on
give
a
last
look
round
,
he
observe
that
Seth
,
who
have
be
work
here
to
-
day
,
have
leave
his
basket
of
tool
behind
him
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
th
'
lad
's
forget
his
tool
,
"
think
Adam
,
"
and
he
be
get
to
work
up
at
the
shop
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
there
never
be
such
a
chap
for
wool
-
gathering
;
he
would
leave
his
head
behind
him
,
if
it
be
loose
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
lucky
<EOS>
I
have
see
'em
;
I
will
carry
'em
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
building
of
the
Chase
Farm
lie
at
one
extremity
of
the
Chase
,
at
about
ten
minute
'
walk
distance
from
the
Abbey
.
<EOS>
Adam
have
come
thither
on
his
pony
,
intend
to
ride
to
the
stable
and
put
up
his
nag
on
his
way
home
.
<EOS>
at
the
stable
he
encounter
Mr.
Craig
,
who
have
come
to
look
at
the
captain
's
new
horse
,
on
which
he
be
to
ride
away
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
;
and
Mr.
Craig
detain
him
to
tell
how
all
the
servant
be
to
collect
at
the
gate
of
the
courtyard
to
wish
the
young
squire
luck
as
he
ride
out
;
so
that
by
the
time
Adam
have
get
into
the
Chase
,
and
be
stride
along
with
the
basket
of
tool
over
his
shoulder
<EOS>
,
the
sun
be
on
the
point
of
setting
,
and
be
send
level
crimson
ray
among
the
great
trunk
of
the
old
oak
,
and
touch
every
bare
patch
of
ground
with
a
transient
glory
that
make
it
look
like
a
jewel
dropt
upon
the
grass
.
<EOS>
the
wind
have
fall
now
,
and
there
be
only
enough
breeze
to
stir
the
delicate
-
stem
leave
.
<EOS>
any
one
who
have
be
sit
in
the
house
all
day
would
have
be
glad
to
walk
now
;
but
Adam
have
be
quite
enough
in
the
open
air
to
wish
to
shorten
his
way
home
,
and
he
bethink
himself
that
he
may
do
so
by
strike
across
the
Chase
and
go
through
the
Grove
,
where
he
have
never
be
for
year
.
<EOS>
He
hurry
on
across
the
Chase
,
stalk
along
the
narrow
path
between
the
fern
,
with
Gyp
at
his
heel
,
not
linger
to
watch
the
magnificent
change
of
the
light
 
hardly
once
think
of
it
 
yet
feel
its
presence
in
a
certain
calm
happy
awe
which
mingle
itself
with
his
busy
working
-
day
thought
.
<EOS>
how
could
he
help
feel
it
?
<EOS>
the
very
deer
feel
it
,
and
be
more
timid
.
  
<EOS>
presently
Adam
's
thought
recur
to
what
Mr.
Craig
have
say
about
Arthur
Donnithorne
,
and
picture
his
go
away
,
and
the
change
that
may
take
place
before
he
come
back
;
then
they
travel
back
affectionately
over
the
old
scene
of
boyish
companionship
,
and
dwelt
on
Arthur
's
good
quality
,
which
Adam
have
a
pride
in
,
as
we
all
have
in
the
virtue
of
the
superior
who
honour
us
.
<EOS>
a
nature
like
Adam
's
,
with
a
great
need
of
love
and
reverence
in
it
,
depend
for
so
much
of
its
happiness
on
what
it
can
believe
and
feel
about
other
!
<EOS>
and
he
have
no
ideal
world
of
dead
hero
;
he
know
little
of
the
life
of
man
in
the
past
;
he
must
find
the
being
to
whom
he
could
cling
with
love
admiration
among
those
who
come
within
speech
of
him
.
<EOS>
these
pleasant
thought
about
Arthur
bring
a
milder
expression
than
usual
into
his
keen
rough
face
:
perhaps
they
be
the
reason
why
,
when
he
open
the
old
green
gate
lead
into
the
Grove
,
he
pause
to
pat
Gyp
and
say
a
kind
word
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
after
that
pause
,
he
stride
on
again
along
the
broad
winding
path
through
the
Grove
.
<EOS>
what
grand
beech
!
<EOS>
Adam
delight
in
a
fine
tree
of
all
thing
;
as
the
fisherman
's
sight
be
keen
on
the
sea
,
so
Adam
's
perception
be
more
at
home
with
tree
than
with
other
object
.
<EOS>
He
keep
them
in
his
memory
,
as
a
painter
do
,
with
all
the
fleck
and
knot
in
their
bark
,
all
the
curve
and
angle
of
their
bough
,
and
have
often
calculate
the
height
and
content
of
a
trunk
to
a
nicety
,
as
he
stand
look
at
it
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
that
,
not
-
withstand
his
desire
to
get
on
<EOS>
,
he
could
not
help
pause
to
look
at
a
curious
large
beech
which
he
have
see
stand
before
him
at
a
turning
in
the
road
,
and
convince
himself
that
it
be
not
two
tree
wed
together
,
but
only
one
.
<EOS>
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
remember
that
moment
when
he
be
calmly
examine
the
beech
,
as
a
man
remember
his
last
glimpse
of
the
home
where
his
youth
be
pass
,
before
the
road
turn
,
and
he
see
it
no
more
.
<EOS>
the
beech
stand
at
the
last
turning
before
the
Grove
end
in
an
archway
of
bough
that
let
in
the
eastern
light
;
and
as
Adam
step
away
from
the
tree
to
continue
his
walk
,
his
eye
fall
on
two
figure
about
twenty
yard
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
remain
as
motionless
as
a
statue
,
and
turn
almost
as
pale
.
<EOS>
the
two
figure
be
stand
opposite
to
each
other
,
with
clasped
hand
about
to
part
;
and
while
they
be
bend
to
kiss
,
Gyp
,
who
have
be
run
among
the
brushwood
,
come
out
,
catch
sight
of
them
,
and
give
a
sharp
bark
.
<EOS>
They
separate
with
a
start
 
one
hurry
through
the
gate
out
of
the
Grove
,
and
the
other
,
turn
round
,
walk
slowly
,
with
a
sort
of
saunter
,
towards
Adam
who
still
stand
transfixed
and
pale
,
clutch
tight
the
stick
with
which
he
hold
the
basket
of
tool
over
his
shoulder
,
and
look
at
the
approach
figure
with
eye
in
which
amazement
be
fast
turn
to
fierceness
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
Donnithorne
look
flush
and
excited
;
he
have
try
to
make
unpleasant
feeling
more
bearable
by
drink
a
little
more
wine
than
usual
at
dinner
to
-
day
,
and
be
still
enough
under
its
flattering
influence
to
think
more
lightly
of
this
unwishe
-
for
rencontre
with
Adam
than
he
would
otherwise
have
do
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
Adam
be
the
good
person
who
could
have
happen
to
see
him
and
Hetty
together
 
<EOS>
he
be
a
sensible
fellow
,
and
would
not
babble
about
it
to
other
people
.
<EOS>
Arthur
feel
confident
that
he
could
laugh
the
thing
off
and
explain
it
away
.
<EOS>
and
so
he
saunter
forward
with
elaborate
carelessness
 
<EOS>
his
flushed
face
,
his
evening
dress
of
fine
cloth
and
fine
linen
,
his
hand
half
-
thrust
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
all
shine
upon
by
the
strange
evening
light
which
the
light
cloud
have
catch
up
even
to
the
zenith
,
and
be
now
shed
down
between
the
topmost
branch
above
him
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
be
still
motionless
,
look
at
him
as
he
come
up
.
<EOS>
He
understand
it
all
now
 
<EOS>
the
locket
and
everything
else
that
have
be
doubtful
to
him
:
a
terrible
scorching
light
show
him
the
hide
letter
that
change
the
meaning
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
move
a
muscle
,
he
must
inevitably
have
spring
upon
Arthur
like
a
tiger
;
and
in
the
conflict
emotion
that
fill
those
long
moment
,
he
have
tell
himself
that
he
would
not
give
loose
to
passion
,
he
would
only
speak
the
right
thing
.
<EOS>
He
stand
as
if
petrify
by
an
unseen
force
,
but
the
force
be
his
own
strong
will
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Adam
,
"
say
Arthur
,
"
you
have
be
look
at
the
fine
old
beech
,
eh
?
<EOS>
They
be
not
to
be
come
near
by
the
hatchet
,
though
;
this
be
a
sacred
grove
.
<EOS>
I
overtook
pretty
little
Hetty
Sorrel
as
I
be
come
to
my
den
 
<EOS>
the
Hermitage
,
there
.
<EOS>
She
ought
not
to
come
home
this
way
so
late
.
<EOS>
so
I
take
care
of
her
to
the
gate
,
and
ask
for
a
kiss
for
my
pain
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
get
back
now
,
for
this
road
be
confoundedly
damp
.
<EOS>
good
-
night
,
Adam
.
<EOS>
I
shall
see
you
to
-
morrow
 
to
say
good
-
bye
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
be
too
much
preoccupy
with
the
part
he
be
play
himself
to
be
thoroughly
aware
of
the
expression
in
Adam
's
face
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
look
directly
at
Adam
,
but
glance
carelessly
round
at
the
tree
and
then
lift
up
one
foot
to
look
at
the
sole
of
his
boot
.
<EOS>
He
care
to
say
no
more
 
he
have
throw
quite
dust
enough
into
honest
Adam
's
eye
 
and
<EOS>
as
he
speak
the
last
word
,
he
walk
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
stop
a
bit
,
sir
,
"
say
Adam
,
in
a
hard
peremptory
voice
,
without
turn
round
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
get
a
word
to
say
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
pause
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
susceptible
person
be
more
affect
by
a
change
of
tone
than
by
unexpected
word
,
and
Arthur
have
the
susceptibility
of
a
nature
at
once
affectionate
and
vain
.
<EOS>
He
be
still
more
surprised
when
he
see
that
Adam
have
not
move
,
but
stand
with
his
back
to
him
,
as
if
summon
him
to
return
.
<EOS>
what
do
he
mean
?
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
make
a
serious
business
of
this
affair
.
<EOS>
Arthur
feel
his
temper
rise
.
<EOS>
a
patronising
disposition
always
have
its
mean
side
,
and
in
the
confusion
of
his
irritation
and
alarm
there
enter
the
feeling
that
a
man
to
whom
he
have
show
so
much
favour
as
to
Adam
be
not
in
a
position
to
criticize
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
and
yet
he
be
dominate
,
as
one
who
feel
himself
in
the
wrong
always
be
,
by
the
man
whose
good
opinion
he
care
for
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
pride
and
temper
,
there
be
as
much
deprecation
as
anger
in
his
voice
when
he
say
,
"
what
do
you
mean
,
Adam
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
sir
"
 
answer
Adam
,
in
the
same
harsh
voice
,
still
without
turn
round
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean

possess
by
rage
that
could
find
no

vent

begin
to
throw
off
his

his

too
blind
with
passion
to
notice
the
change
that
have
take
place
in

Arthur

his

be
beat
violently

the
discovery

Adam

Hetty

a
shock
which
make
him
for

moment
see
himself
in
the

of
Adam
's
indignation

and
regard
Adam

suffering
as
not
merely
a
consequence

an
element
of

error

the
word
of
hatred

forsook
him

have
think
proudly
that
no

reproach
him
justly

His
first
impulse
,
if
there
have
be
time
for

would
perhaps
have
be
to
utter
word

deal
a

the
delicate

handed
gentleman
be
a
match

strength

skill
enable
him
to
protract
the
struggle
for
some
long
moment

but
between
unarmed

the
battle
be
to
the
strong

where
the
strong
be
no
blunderer

Arthur
must
sink
under
a
well

plant
blow
of
Adam

as

the
blow
soon
come

Arthur
fall

his

conceal
in

Adam
could
only
discern
his
darkly

body

He
stand
still

what
be
the

of
it

what
have
he
do
by

<EOS>
only
satisfy
his

with
the
oncoming

dread
he
kneel
down

lift

a
Dilemma

perceive
a
gleam

consciousness

Arthur
turn
his
eye
on
Adam
with
a
vague
stare
which
give
way
to
a
slightly
startled
motion
as

from
the
shock
of
return
memory

only
shiver
again

Arthur
put
his

up
to

when

have
unbutton
it

he
take
a
long
breath

"

lay
my

down

faintly

me
some
water

lay
the
head
down
gently
on

again

empty
the
tool
out
of
the
flag

basket
,
hurry
through
the
tree
to
the
edge
of
the
Grove
border
on

Chase

where

brook
run
below

when

return
with

leaking

still
half

full

look
at

with
a
more
thoroughly
reawaken
consciousness

me
on
my
leg
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
terribly
shaky
and
dizzy
,
"
Arthur
say
,
as
he
stand
lean
on
Adam
's
arm
;
"
that
blow
of
yours
must
have
come
against
me
like
a
battering
-
ram
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
I
can
walk
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
lean
on
me
,
sir
;
I
will
get
you
along
,
"
say
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
or
,
will
you
sit
down
a
bit
longer
,
on
my
coat
here
,
and
I
will
prop
y
'
up
.
<EOS>
You
will
perhaps
be
well
in
a
minute
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Arthur
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
to
the
hermitage
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
get
some
brandy
there
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
short
road
to
it
a
little
farther
on
,
near
the
gate
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
just
help
me
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
walk
slowly
,
with
frequent
pause
,
but
without
speak
again
.
<EOS>
in
both
of
them
,
the
concentration
in
the
present
which
have
attend
the
first
moment
of
Arthur
's
revival
have
now
give
way
to
a
vivid
recollection
of
the
previous
scene
.
<EOS>
It
be
nearly
dark
in
the
narrow
path
among
the
tree
,
but
within
the
circle
of
fir
-
tree
round
the
hermitage
<EOS>
there
be
room
for
the
grow
moonlight
to
enter
in
at
the
window
.
<EOS>
Their
step
be
noiseless
on
the
thick
carpet
of
fir
-
needle
,
and
the
outward
stillness
seem
to
heighten
their
inward
consciousness
,
as
Arthur
take
the
key
out
of
his
pocket
and
place
it
in
Adam
's
hand
,
for
him
to
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
Adam
have
not
know
before
that
Arthur
have
furnish
the
old
Hermitage
and
make
it
a
retreat
for
himself
,
and
it
be
a
surprise
to
him
when
he
open
the
door
to
see
a
snug
room
with
all
the
sign
of
frequent
habitation
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
loose
Adam
's
arm
and
throw
himself
on
the
ottoman
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
see
my
hunting
-
bottle
somewhere
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
a
leather
case
with
a
bottle
and
glass
in
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
be
not
long
in
find
the
case
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
very
little
brandy
in
it
,
sir
,
"
he
say
,
turn
it
downwards
over
the
glass
,
as
he
hold
it
before
the
window
;
"
hardly
this
little
glassful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
give
me
that
,
"
say
Arthur
,
with
the
peevishness
of
physical
depression
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
take
some
sip
,
Adam
say
,
"
have
not
I
better
run
to
th
'
house
,
sir
,
and
get
some
more
brandy
?
<EOS>
I
can
be
there
and
back
pretty
soon
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
stiff
walk
home
for
you
,
if
you
do
not
have
something
to
revive
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
 
go
.
<EOS>
but
do
not
say
I
be
ill
.
<EOS>
ask
for
my
man
Pym
,
and
tell
him
to
get
it
from
Mills
,
and
not
to
say
I
be
at
the
Hermitage
.
<EOS>
get
some
water
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
be
relieve
to
have
an
active
task
 
both
of
them
be
relieve
to
be
apart
from
each
other
for
a
short
time
.
<EOS>
but
Adam
's
swift
pace
could
not
still
the
eager
pain
of
think
 
of
live
again
with
concentrate
suffer
through
the
last
wretched
hour
,
and
look
out
from
it
over
all
the
new
sad
future
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
lie
still
for
some
minute
after
Adam
be
go
,
but
presently
he
rise
feebly
from
the
ottoman
and
peer
about
slowly
in
the
broken
moonlight
,
seek
something
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
short
bit
of
wax
candle
that
stand
amongst
a
confusion
of
writing
and
draw
material
.
<EOS>
there
be
more
searching
for
the
mean
of
light
the
candle
,
and
when
that
be
do
,
he
go
cautiously
round
the
room
,
as
if
wish
to
assure
himself
of
the
presence
or
absence
of
something
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
have
find
a
slight
thing
,
which
he
put
first
in
his
pocket
,
and
then
,
on
a
second
thought
,
take
out
again
and
thrust
deep
down
into
a
waste
-
paper
basket
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
woman
's
little
,
pink
,
silk
neckerchief
.
<EOS>
He
set
the
candle
on
the
table
,
and
throw
himself
down
on
the
ottoman
again
,
exhaust
with
the
effort
.
  
<EOS>
when
Adam
come
back
with
his
supply
,
his
entrance
awake
Arthur
from
a
doze
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
right
,
"
Arthur
say
;
"
I
be
tremendously
in
want
of
some
brandy
-
vigour
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
see
you
have
get
a
light
,
sir
,
"
say
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
think
I
would
better
have
ask
for
a
lanthorn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
;
the
candle
will
last
long
enough
 
<EOS>
I
shall
soon
be
up
to
walk
home
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
go
before
I
have
see
you
<EOS>
safe
home
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
say
Adam
,
hesitatingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
:
it
will
be
well
for
you
to
stay
 
sit
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
sit
down
,
and
they
remain
opposite
to
each
other
in
uneasy
silence
,
while
Arthur
slowly
drink
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
with
visibly
renovate
effect
.
<EOS>
He
begin
to
lie
in
a
more
voluntary
position
,
and
look
as
if
he
be
less
overpower
by
bodily
sensation
.
<EOS>
Adam
be
keenly
alive
to
these
indication
,
and
as
his
anxiety
about
Arthur
's
condition
begin
to
be
allay
,
he
feel
more
of
that
impatience
which
every
one
know
who
have
have
his
just
indignation
suspend
by
the
physical
state
of
the
culprit
.
<EOS>
yet
there
be
one
thing
on
his
mind
to
be
do
before
he
could
recur
to
remonstrance
<EOS>
:
it
be
to
confess
what
have
be
unjust
in
his
own
word
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
long
all
the
more
to
make
this
confession
,
that
his
indignation
may
be
free
again
;
and
as
he
see
the
sign
of
return
ease
in
Arthur
,
the
word
again
and
again
come
to
his
lip
and
go
back
,
check
by
the
thought
that
it
would
be
well
to
leave
everything
till
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
as
long
as
they
be
silent
they
do
not
look
at
each
other
,
and
a
foreboding
come
across
Adam
that
if
they
begin
to
speak
as
though
they
remember
the
past
 
if
they
look
at
each
other
with
full
recognition
 
they
must
take
fire
again
.
<EOS>
so
they
sit
in
silence
till
the
bit
of
wax
candle
flicker
low
in
the
socket
,
the
silence
all
the
while
become
more
irksome
to
Adam
.
<EOS>
Arthur
have
just
pour
out
some
more
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
and
he
throw
one
arm
behind
his
head
and
draw
up
one
leg
in
an
attitude
of
recover
ease
,
which
be
an
irresistible
temptation
to
Adam
to
speak
what
be
on
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
begin
to
feel
more
yourself
again
,
sir
,
"
he
say
,
as
the
candle
go
out
and
they
be
half
-
hide
from
each
other
in
the
faint
moonlight
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
:
I
do
not
feel
good
for
much
 
very
lazy
,
and
not
inclined
to
move
;
but
I
will
go
home
when
I
have
take
this
dose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
slight
pause
before
Adam
say
,
"
My
temper
get
the
well
of
me
,
and
I
say
thing
as
be
not
true
.
<EOS>
I
would
no
right
to
speak
<EOS>
as
if
you
would
know
you
be
do
me
an
injury
:
you
would
no
ground
for
know
it
;
I
have
always
keep
what
I
feel
for
her
as
secret
as
I
could
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
pause
again
before
he
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
perhaps
I
judge
you
too
harsh
 
<EOS>
I
be
apt
to
be
harsh
 
<EOS>
and
you
may
have
act
out
o
'
thoughtlessness
more
than
I
should
ha
'
believe
<EOS>
be
possible
for
a
man
with
a
heart
and
a
conscience
.
<EOS>
We
be
not
all
put
together
alike
,
and
we
may
misjudge
one
another
.
<EOS>
God
know
,
it
be
all
the
joy
I
could
have
now
,
to
think
the
good
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
want
to
go
home
without
say
any
more
 
he
be
too
painfully
embarrassed
in
mind
,
as
well
as
too
weak
in
body
,
to
wish
for
any
further
explanation
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
and
yet
it
be
a
relief
to
him
that
Adam
reopen
the
subject
in
a
way
the
least
difficult
for
him
to
answer
.
<EOS>
Arthur
be
in
the
wretched
position
of
an
open
,
generous
man
who
have
commit
an
error
which
make
deception
seem
a
necessity
.
<EOS>
the
native
impulse
to
give
truth
in
return
for
truth
,
to
meet
trust
with
frank
confession
,
must
be
suppress
,
and
duty
be
become
a
question
of
tactic
.
<EOS>
His
deed
be
react
upon
him
 
be
already
govern
him
tyrannously
and
force
him
into
a
course
that
jar
with
his
habitual
feeling
.
<EOS>
the
only
aim
that
seem
admissible
to
him
now
be
to
deceive
Adam
to
the
utmost
:
to
make
Adam
think
better
of
him
than
he
deserve
.
<EOS>
and
when
he
hear
the
word
of
honest
retractation
 
when
he
hear
the
sad
appeal
with
which
Adam
end
 
he
be
oblige
to
rejoice
in
the
remain
of
ignorant
confidence
it
imply
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
answer
immediately
,
for
he
have
to
be
judicious
and
not
truthful
.
  
<EOS>
"
say
no
more
about
our
anger
,
Adam
,
"
he
say
,
at
last
,
very
languidly
,
for
the
labour
of
speech
be
unwelcome
to
him
;
"
I
forgive
your
momentary
injustice
 
<EOS>
it
be
quite
natural
,
with
the
exaggerated
notion
you
have
in
your
mind

<EOS>
We
shall
be
none
the
bad
friend
in

I
hope

because
we
have
fight

<EOS>
You
have
the
good
of
it

for
I

be
most
in

come
,

us
shake
hand

<EOS>
Arthur
hold
out
his
hand
,
but
Adam
sit
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
to
say
"
no
"
to
that
,
sir

he

,
"
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
shake
hand
till
it
be
clear
what
we
mean
by't

<EOS>
I
be
wrong
when
I
speak
as
if
you
would
do
me
an
injury
knowingly
,

I
be
not
wrong
in
what
I
say
before
,
about
your
behaviour
t

Hetty
,
and
I
can
not
shake
hand
with
you
as
if
I
hold
you
my
friend
the

as
ever

till
you
have
clear
that
up
better
.

"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
swallow
his
pride
and
resentment
as
he
draw
back
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
be
silent
for
some
moment
,
and
then
say
,
as
indifferently
as
he
could
,
"
I
do
not
know
what
you
mean
by
clear
up
,
Adam
.
<EOS>
I
have
tell
you
already
that
you
think
too
seriously
of
a
little
flirtation
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
be
right
in
supposing
there
be
any
danger
in
it
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
away
on
Saturday
,
and
there
will
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
pain
it
have
give
you
,
I
be
heartily
sorry
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
say
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
say
nothing
,
but
rise
from
his
chair
and
stand
with
his
face
towards
one
of
the
window
,
as
if
look
at
the
blackness
of
the
moonlit
fir
-
tree
;
but
he
be
in
reality
conscious
of
nothing
but
the
conflict
within
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
no
use
now
 
his
resolution
not
to
speak
till
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
must
speak
there
and
then
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
several
minute
before
he
turn
round
and
step
near
to
Arthur
,
stand
and
look
down
on
him
as
he
lie
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
well
for
me
to
speak
plain
,
"
he
say
,
with
evident
effort
,
"
though
it
be
hard
work
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
sir
,
this
be
not
a
trifle
to
me
,
whatever
it
may
be
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
be
none
o
'
<EOS>
them
man
as
can
go
make
love
first
to
one
woman
and
then
t
'
another
,
and
do
not
think
it
much
odd
which
of
'em
I
take
.
<EOS>
what
I
feel
for
Hetty
's
a
different
sort
o
'
love
,
such
as
I
believe
nobody
can
know
much
about
<EOS>
but
them
as
feel
it
and
God
as
have
give
it
to
'em
.
<EOS>
She
be
more
nor
everything
else
to
me
,
all
but
my
conscience
and
my
good
name
.
<EOS>
and
if
it
be
true
what
you
have
be
say
all
along
 
and
if
it
be
only
be
trifle
and
flirt
as
you
call
it
,
as
will
be
put
an
end
to
by
your
go
away

why
,
then
,
I
would
wait
,
and
hope
her
heart

<EOS>
ud
turn
to
me
after
all
.
<EOS>
I
be
loath
to
think
you
would
speak
false
to
me
,
and
I
will
believe
your
word
,
however
thing
may
look
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
be
wrong
Hetty
more
than
me
not
to
believe
it
,
"
say
Arthur
,
almost
violently
,
start
up
from
the
ottoman
and
move
away
.
<EOS>
but
he
throw
himself
into
a
chair
again
directly
,
say
,
more
feebly
,
"
You
seem
to
forget
that
,
in
suspect
me

you
be
cast
imputation
upon
her

"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
sir
,
"
Adam
say
,
in
a
calm
voice
,
as
if
he
be
half
-
relieved
 
for
he
be
too
straightforward
to
make
a
distinction
between
a
direct
falsehood
and
an
indirect
one
 
"
Nay
,
sir
,
thing
do
not
lie
level
between
Hetty
and
you

<EOS>
You
be
act
with
your
eye
open
,
whatever
you
may
do
;
but
how
do
you
know
what
be
be
in
her
mind
?
<EOS>
She
be
all
but
a
child
 
as
any
man
with
a
conscience
in
him
ought
to
feel
bind
to
take
care
on
.
<EOS>
and
whatever
you
may
think
,
I
know
you
have
disturb
her
mind
.
<EOS>
I
know
she

her
heart
on
you

<EOS>
for
there
be
a
many
thing
clear
to
me
now
as
I
do
not
understand
before
.
<EOS>
but
you
seem
to
make
light
o
'
what
she
may
feel
 
<EOS>
you
do
not
think
o

that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
God
,
Adam
,
let
me
alone
!
"
<EOS>
Arthur
burst
out
impetuously
;
"
I
feel
it
enough
without
your
worry
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
aware
of
his
indiscretion
as
soon
as
the
word
have
escape
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
if
you
feel
it
,
"
Adam
rejoin
,
eagerly
;
"
if
you
feel
as
you
may
ha
'
put
false
notion
into
her
mind
,
and
make
her
believe
as
you
love
her
,
<EOS>
when
all
the
while
you
mean
nothing
,
I
have
this
demand
to
make
of
you
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
speak
for
myself
,
but
for
her
.
<EOS>
I
ask
you
t

undeceive
her
before
you
go
away

<EOS>
Y'aren't
go
away
for
ever
,
and
if
you
leave
her
behind
with
a
notion
in
her
head
o

<EOS>
your
feeling
about
her
the
same
as
she
feel
about
you
<EOS>
,
she
will
be
hanker
after
you
,
and
the
mischief
may
get
bad
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
a
smart
to
her
now
,
but
it
will
save
her
pain
<EOS>
i

th

end

<EOS>
I
ask
you
to
write
a
letter
 
you
may
trust
to
my
seeing
as
she
get
it
.
<EOS>
tell
her
the
truth
,
and
take
blame
to
yourself
for
behave
as
you
would
no
right
to
do
to
a
young
woman
as
be
not
your

<EOS>
I
speak
plain
,
sir
,
but
I
can
not
speak
any
other
way

<EOS>
there
be
nobody

I

matter

"
say
Arthur
,
more
and
more
irritated
by
mingled
distress
and
perplexity
,
"
without
give
promise
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
shall
take
what

I

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

Adam
,
in
an
abrupt
decide
tone
,
"
that
will
not

<EOS>
I

I

we

up

"
  
<EOS>
there
be
no

<EOS>
then
Arthur

,
"
I

see
you
to

I
can
bear
no
more
now

I
be
ill

<EOS>
He
rise
as
he
speak
,
and
reach
his
cap
,
as
if
intend
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not

again
!
"
<EOS>
Adam
exclaim
,
with
a
flash
of
recur
anger
and
suspicion
,
move
towards
the
door
and
place
his
back
against
it
.
"
<EOS>
either
tell
me
she
can
never

my

<EOS>
tell
me
you

lie
 
or
else
<EOS>
promise
me
what
I
have
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
Adam
,
utter
this
alternative
,
stand
like
a
terrible
fate
before
Arthur
,
who
have
move
forward
a
step
or
two
,
and
now
stop
,
faint
,
shaken
,
sick
in
mind
and
body
.
<EOS>
It
seem
long
to
both
of
them
 
that
inward
struggle
of
Arthur
's
 
before
he
say
,
feebly
,
"
I
promise
;
let
me
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
move
away
from
the
door
and
open
it
,
but
when
Arthur
reach
the
step
,
he
stop
again
and
lean
against
the
door
-
post
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
well
enough
to
walk
alone
,
sir
,
"
say
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
take
my
arm
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
make
no
answer
,
and
presently
walk
on
,
Adam
follow
.
<EOS>
but
,
after
a
few
step
,
he
stand
still
again
,
and
say
,
coldly
,
"
I
believe
I
must
trouble
you
.
<EOS>
It
be
get
late
now
,
and
there
may
be
an
alarm
set
up
about
me
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
give
his
arm
,
and
they
walk
on
without
utter
a
word
,
till
they
come
where
the
basket
and
the
tool
lie
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
pick
up
the
tool
,
sir
,
"
Adam
say
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
my
brother
's
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
they
will
be
rust
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
please
to
wait
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
stand
still
without
speak
,
and
no
other
word
pass
between
them
till
they
be
at
the
side
entrance
,
where
he
hope
to
get
in
without
be
see
by
any
one
.
<EOS>
He
say
then
,
"
thank
you
;
<EOS>
I
need
not
trouble
you
any
further
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
time
will
it
be
conven'ent
for
me
to
see
you
to
-
morrow
,
sir
?
"
say
Adam
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
send
me
word
that
you
be
here
at
five
o'clock
,
"
say
Arthur
;
"
not
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
good
-
night
,
sir
,
"
say
Adam
.
<EOS>
but
he
hear
no
reply
;
Arthur
have
turn
into
the
house
.
    
<EOS>
the
Next
Morning
  
ARTHUR
do
not
pass
a
sleepless
night
;
he
sleep
long
and
well
.
<EOS>
for
sleep
come
to
the
perplex
 
if
the
perplexed
be
only
weary
enough
.
<EOS>
but
at
seven
he
ring
his
bell
and
astonish
Pym
by
declare
he
be
go
to
get
up
,
and
must
have
breakfast
bring
to
him
at
eight
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
see
that
my
mare
be
saddle
at
half
-
past
eight
,
and
tell
my
grandfather
when
he
be
down
that
I
be
well
this
morning
and
be
go
for
a
ride
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
be
awake
an
hour
,
and
could
rest
in
bed
no
longer
.
<EOS>
in
bed
our
yesterday
be
too
oppressive
:
if
a
man
can
only
get
up
,
though
it
be
but
to
whistle
or
to
smoke
,
he
have
a
present
which
offer
some
resistance
to
the
past
 
sensation
which
assert
themselves
against
tyrannous
memory
.
<EOS>
and
if
there
be
such
a
thing
as
take
average
of
feeling
,
it
would
certainly
be
find
that
in
the
hunting
and
shooting
season
regret
,
self
-
reproach
,
and
mortified
pride
weigh
light
on
country
gentleman
than
in
late
spring
and
summer
.
<EOS>
Arthur
feel
that
he
should
be
more
of
a
man
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
even
the
presence
of
Pym
,
wait
on
him
with
the
usual
deference
,
be
a
reassurance
to
him
after
the
scene
of
yesterday
.
<EOS>
for
,
with
Arthur
's
sensitiveness
to
opinion
,
the
loss
of
Adam
's
respect
be
a
shock
to
his
self
-
contentment
which
suffuse
his
imagination
with
the
sense
that
he
have
sink
in
all
eye
 
as
a
sudden
shock
of
fear
from
some
real
peril
<EOS>
make
a
nervous
woman
afraid
even
to
step
,
because
all
her
perception
be
suffuse
with
a
sense
of
danger
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
's
,
as
you
know
,
be
a
loving
nature
.
<EOS>
deed
of
kindness
be
as
easy
to
him
as
a
bad
habit
:
they
be
the
common
issue
of
his
weakness
and
good
quality
,
of
his
egoism
and
his
sympathy
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
like
to
witness
pain
,
and
he
like
to
have
grateful
eye
beam
on
him
as
the
giver
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
a
lad
of
seven
,
he
one
day
kick
down
an
old
gardener
's
pitcher
of
broth
,
from
no
motive
but
a
kicking
impulse
,
not
reflect
that
it
be
the
old
man
's
dinner
;
but
on
learn
that
sad
fact
,
he
take
his
favourite
pencil
-
case
and
a
silver
-
hafte
knife
out
of
his
pocket
and
offer
them
as
compensation
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
the
same
Arthur
ever
since
,
try
to
make
all
offence
forget
in
benefit
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
any
bitterness
in
his
nature
,
it
could
only
show
itself
against
the
man
who
refuse
to
be
conciliate
by
him
.
<EOS>
and
perhaps
the
time
be
come
for
some
of
that
bitterness
to
rise
.
<EOS>
at
the
first
moment
,
Arthur
have
feel
pure
distress
and
self
-
reproach
at
discover
that
Adam
's
happiness
be
involve
in
his
relation
to
Hetty
.
<EOS>
if
there
have
be
a
possibility
of
make
Adam
tenfold
amend
 
if
deed
of
gift
,
or
any
other
deed
,
could
have
restore
Adam
's
contentment
and
regard
for
him
as
a
benefactor
,
Arthur
would
not
only
have
execute
them
without
hesitation
,
but
would
have
feel
bind
all
the
more
closely
to
Adam
,
and
would
never
have
be
weary
of
make
retribution
.
<EOS>
but
Adam
could
receive
no
amend
;
his
suffering
could
not
be
cancel
;
his
respect
and
affection
could
not
be
recover
by
any
prompt
deed
of
atonement
.
<EOS>
He
stand
like
an
immovable
obstacle
against
which
no
pressure
could
avail
;
an
embodiment
of
what
Arthur
most
shrink
from
believe
in
 
the
irrevocableness
of
his
own
wrongdoing
.
<EOS>
the
word
of
scorn
,
the
refusal
to
shake
hand
,
the
mastery
assert
over
him
in
their
last
conversation
in
the
hermitage
 
above
all
,
the
sense
of
have
be
knock
down
,
to
which
a
man
do
not
very
well
reconcile
himself
,
even
under
the
most
heroic
circumstance
 
press
on
him
with
a
gall
pain
which
be
strong
than
compunction
.
<EOS>
Arthur
would
so
gladly
have
persuade
himself
that
he
have
do
no
harm
!
<EOS>
and
if
no
one
have
tell
him
the
contrary
,
he
could
have
persuade
himself
so
much
better
.
<EOS>
nemesis
can
seldom
forge
a
sword
for
herself
out
of
our
conscience
 
out
of
the
suffering
we
feel
in
the
suffering
we
may
have
cause
:
there
be
rarely
metal
enough
there
to
make
an
effective
weapon
.
<EOS>
Our
moral
sense
learn
the
manner
of
good
society
and
smile
when
other
smile
,
but
when
some
rude
person
give
rough
name
to
our
action
,
she
be
apt
to
take
part
against
us
.
<EOS>
and
so
it
be
with
Arthur
:
<EOS>
Adam
's
judgment
of
him
,
Adam
's
grating
word
,
disturb
his
self
-
soothe
argument
.
  
<EOS>
not
that
Arthur
have
be
at
ease
before
Adam
's
discovery
.
<EOS>
Struggles
and
resolve
have
transform
themselves
into
compunction
and
anxiety
.
<EOS>
He
be
distressed
for
Hetty
's
sake
,
and
distress
for
his
own
,
that
he
must
leave
her
behind
.
<EOS>
He
have
always
,
both
in
make
and
break
resolution
,
look
beyond
his
passion
and
see
that
it
must
speedily
end
in
separation
;
but
his
nature
be
too
ardent
and
tender
for
him
not
to
suffer
at
this
parting
;
and
on
Hetty
's
account
he
be
fill
with
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
He
have
find
out
the
dream
in
which
she
be
live
 
<EOS>
that
she
be
to
be
a
lady
in
silk
and
satin
 
<EOS>
and
when
he
have
first
talk
to
her
about
his
go
away
,
she
have
ask
him
tremblingly
to
let
her
go
with
him
and
be
married
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
painful
knowledge
of
this
which
have
give
the
most
exasperating
ste
to
Adam
's
reproach
.
<EOS>
He
have
say
no
word
with
the
purpose
of
deceive
her
 
<EOS>
her
vision
be
all
spin
by
her
own
childish
fancy
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
oblige
to
confess
to
himself
that
it
be
spin
half
out
of
his
own
action
.
<EOS>
and
to
increase
the
mischief
,
on
this
last
evening
he
have
not
dare
to
hint
the
truth
to
Hetty
;
he
have
be
oblige
to
soothe
her
with
tender
,
hopeful
word
,
lest
he
should
throw
her
into
violent
distress
.
<EOS>
He
feel
the
situation
acutely
,
feel
the
sorrow
of
the
dear
thing
in
the
present
,
and
think
with
a
dark
anxiety
of
the
tenacity
which
her
feeling
may
have
in
the
future
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
one
sharp
point
which
press
against
him
;
every
other
he
could
evade
by
hopeful
self
-
persuasion
.
<EOS>
the
whole
thing
have
be
secret
;
the
Poysers
have
not
the
shadow
of
a
suspicion
.
<EOS>
no
one
,
except
Adam
,
know
anything
of
what
have
pass
 
<EOS>
no
one
else
be
likely
to
know
;
for
Arthur
have
impress
on
Hetty
that
it
would
be
fatal
to
betray
,
by
word
or
look
,
that
there
have
be
the
least
intimacy
between
them
;
and
Adam
,
who
know
half
their
secret
,
would
rather
help
them
to
keep
it
than
betray
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
unfortunate
business
altogether
,
but
there
be
no
use
in
make
it
bad
than
it
be
by
imaginary
exaggeration
and
foreboding
of
evil
that
may
never
come
.
<EOS>
the
temporary
sadness
for
Hetty
be
the
bad
consequence
;
he
resolutely
turn
away
his
eye
from
any
bad
consequence
that
be
not
demonstrably
inevitable
.
<EOS>
but
 
but
Hetty
may
have
have
the
trouble
in
some
other
way
if
not
in
this
.
<EOS>
and
perhaps
hereafter
he
may
be
able
to
do
a
great
deal
for
her
and
make
up
to
her
for
all
the
tear
she
would
shed
about
him
.
<EOS>
She
would
owe
the
advantage
of
his
care
for
her
in
future
year
to
the
sorrow
she
have
incur
now
.
<EOS>
so
good
come
out
of
evil
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
beautiful
arrangement
of
thing
!
  
<EOS>
be
you
inclined
to
ask
whether
this
can
be
the
same
Arthur
who
,
two
month
ago
,
have
that
freshness
of
feeling
,
that
delicate
honour
which
shrink
from
wound
even
a
sentiment
,
and
do
not
contemplate
any
more
positive
offence
as
possible
for
it
?
 
<EOS>
who
think
that
his
own
self
-
respect
be
a
high
tribunal
than
any
external
opinion
?
<EOS>
the
same
,
I
assure
you
,
only
under
different
condition
.
<EOS>
Our
deed
determine
us
,
as
much
as
we
determine
our
deed
,
and
until
we
know
what
have
be
or
will
be
the
peculiar
combination
of
outward
with
inward
fact
,
which
constitute
a
man
's
critical
action
,
it
will
be
well
not
to
think
ourselves
wise
about
his
character
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
terrible
coercion
in
our
deed
,
which
may
first
turn
the
honest
man
into
a
deceiver
and
then
reconcile
him
to
the
change
,
for
this
reason
 
that
the
second
wrong
present
itself
to
him
in
the
guise
of
the
only
practicable
right
.
<EOS>
the
action
which
before
commission
have
be
see
with
that
blended
common
sense
and
fresh
untarnished
feeling
which
be
the
healthy
eye
of
the
soul
,
be
look
at
afterwards
with
the
lens
of
apologetic
ingenuity
,
through
which
all
thing
that
man
call
beautiful
and
ugly
be
see
to
be
make
up
of
texture
very
much
alike
.
<EOS>
Europe
adjust
itself
to
a
_
fait
accompli
_
,
and
so
do
an
individual
character
 
until
the
placid
adjustment
be
disturb
by
a
convulsive
retribution
.
  
<EOS>
no
man
can
escape
this
vitiate
effect
of
an
offence
against
his
own
sentiment
of
right
,
and
the
effect
be
the
strong
in
Arthur
because
of
that
very
need
of
self
-
respect
which
,
while
his
conscience
be
still
at
ease
,
be
one
of
his
good
safeguard
.
<EOS>
self
-
accusation
be
too
painful
to
him
 
<EOS>
he
could
not
face
it
.
<EOS>
He
must
persuade
himself
that
he
have
not
be
very
much
to
blame
;
he
begin
even
to
pity
himself
for
the
necessity
he
be
under
of
deceive
Adam
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
course
so
opposed
to
the
honesty
of
his
own
nature
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
it
be
the
only
right
thing
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
whatever
have
be
amiss
in
him
,
he
be
miserable
enough
in
consequence
:
miserable
about
Hetty
;
miserable
about
this
letter
that
he
have
promise
to
write
,
and
that
seem
at
one
moment
to
be
a
gross
barbarity
,
at
another
perhaps
the
great
kindness
he
could
do
to
her
.
<EOS>
and
across
all
this
reflection
would
dart
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
sudden
impulse
of
passionate
defiance
towards
all
consequence
.
<EOS>
He
would
carry
Hetty
away
,
and
all
other
consideration
may
go
to
....
  
<EOS>
in
this
state
of
mind
the
four
wall
of
his
room
make
an
intolerable
prison
to
him
;
they
seem
to
hem
in
and
press
down
upon
him
all
the
crowd
of
contradictory
thought
and
conflict
feeling
,
some
of
which
would
fly
away
in
the
open
air
.
<EOS>
He
have
only
an
hour
or
two
to
make
up
his
mind
in
,
and
he
must
get
clear
and
calm
.
<EOS>
once
on
Meg
's
back
,
in
the
fresh
air
of
that
fine
morning
,
he
should
be
more
master
of
the
situation
.
  
<EOS>
the
pretty
creature
arch
her
bay
neck
in
the
sunshine
,
and
paw
the
gravel
,
and
tremble
with
pleasure
when
her
master
stroke
her
nose
,
and
pat
her
,
and
talk
to
her
even
in
a
more
caressing
tone
than
usual
.
<EOS>
He
love
her
the
well
because
she
know
nothing
of
his
secret
.
<EOS>
but
Meg
be
quite
as
well
acquaint
with
her
master
's
mental
state
as
many
other
of
her
sex
with
the
mental
condition
of
the
nice
young
gentleman
towards
whom
their
heart
be
in
a
state
of
flutter
expectation
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
canter
for
five
mile
beyond
the
Chase
,
till
he
be
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
where
there
be
no
hedge
or
tree
to
hem
in
the
road
.
<EOS>
then
he
throw
the
bridle
on
Meg
's
neck
and
prepare
to
make
up
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
Hetty
know
that
their
meeting
yesterday
must
be
the
last
before
Arthur
go
away
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
possibility
of
their
contrive
another
without
exciting
suspicion
 
<EOS>
and
she
be
like
a
frightened
child
,
unable
to
think
of
anything
,
only
able
to
cry
at
the
mention
of
parting
,
and
then
put
her
face
up
to
have
the
tear
kiss
away
.
<EOS>
He
could
do
nothing
but
comfort
her
,
and
lull
her
into
dream
on
.
<EOS>
a
letter
would
be
a
dreadfully
abrupt
way
of
awaken
her
!
<EOS>
yet
there
be
truth
in
what
Adam
say
 
that
it
would
save
her
from
a
lengthen
delusion
,
which
may
be
bad
than
a
sharp
immediate
pain
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
the
only
way
of
satisfy
Adam
,
who
must
be
satisfied
,
for
more
reason
than
one
.
<EOS>
if
he
could
have
see
her
again
!
<EOS>
but
that
be
impossible
;
there
be
such
a
thorny
hedge
of
hindrance
between
them
,
and
an
imprudence
would
be
fatal
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
if
he
COULD
see
her
again
,
what
good
would
it
do
?
<EOS>
only
cause
him
to
suffer
more
from
the
sight
of
her
distress
and
the
remembrance
of
it
.
<EOS>
away
from
him
she
be
surround
by
all
the
motive
to
self
-
control
.
  
<EOS>
a
sudden
dread
here
fall
like
a
shadow
across
his
imagination
 
<EOS>
the
dread
lest
she
should
do
something
violent
in
her
grief
;
and
close
upon
that
dread
come
another
,
which
deepen
the
shadow
.
<EOS>
but
he
shake
them
off
with
the
force
of
youth
and
hope
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
ground
for
paint
the
future
in
that
dark
way
?
<EOS>
It
be
just
as
likely
to
be
the
reverse
.
<EOS>
Arthur
tell
himself
he
do
not
deserve
that
thing
should
turn
out
badly
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
mean
beforehand
to
do
anything
his
conscience
disapprove
;
he
have
be
lead
on
by
circumstance
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
sort
of
implicit
confidence
in
him
that
he
be
really
such
a
good
fellow
at
bottom
,
Providence
would
not
treat
him
harshly
.
  
<EOS>
at
all
event
,
he
could
not
help
what
would
come
now
:
all
he
could
do
be
to
take
what
seem
the
good
course
at
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
and
he
persuade
himself
that
that
course
be
to
make
the
way
open
between
Adam
and
Hetty
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
may
really
turn
to
Adam
,
as
he
say
,
after
a
while
;
and
in
that
case
there
would
have
be
no
great
harm
do
,
since
it
be
still
Adam
's
ardent
wish
to
make
her
his
wife
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
Adam
be
deceive
 
deceive
in
a
way
that
Arthur
would
have
resent
as
a
deep
wrong
if
it
have
be
practise
on
himself
.
<EOS>
that
be
a
reflection
that
mar
the
consoling
prospect
.
<EOS>
Arthur
's
cheek
even
burn
in
mingle
shame
and
irritation
at
the
thought
.
<EOS>
but
what
could
a
man
do
in
such
a
dilemma
?
<EOS>
He
be
bind
in
honour
to
say
no
word
that
could
injure
Hetty
:
his
first
duty
be
to
guard
her
.
<EOS>
He
would
never
have
tell
or
act
a
lie
on
his
own
account
.
<EOS>
good
God
!
<EOS>
what
a
miserable
fool
he
be
to
have
bring
himself
into
such
a
dilemma
;
and
yet
,
if
ever
a
man
have
excuse
,
he
have
.
<EOS>
(
pity
that
consequence
be
determine
not
by
excuse
but
by
action
!
)
  
<EOS>
well
,
the
letter
must
be
write
;
it
be
the
only
mean
that
promise
a
solution
of
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
the
tear
come
into
Arthur
's
eye
as
he
think
of
Hetty
read
it
;
but
it
would
be
almost
as
hard
for
him
to
write
it
;
he
be
not
do
anything
easy
to
himself
;
and
this
last
thought
help
him
to
arrive
at
a
conclusion
.
<EOS>
He
could
never
deliberately
have
take
a
step
which
inflict
pain
on
another
and
leave
himself
at
ease
.
<EOS>
even
a
movement
of
jealousy
at
the
thought
of
give
up
Hetty
to
Adam
go
to
convince
him
that
he
be
make
a
sacrifice
.
  
<EOS>
when
once
he
have
come
to
this
conclusion
,
he
turn
Meg
round
and
set
off
home
again
in
a
canter
.
<EOS>
the
letter
should
be
write
the
first
thing
,
and
the
rest
of
the
day
would
be
fill
up
with
other
business
:
he
should
have
no
time
to
look
behind
him
.
<EOS>
happily
,
Irwine
and
Gawaine
be
come
to
dinner
,
and
by
twelve
o'clock
the
next
day
he
should
have
leave
the
Chase
mile
behind
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
security
in
this
constant
occupation
against
an
uncontrollable
impulse
seize
him
to
rush
to
Hetty
and
thrust
into
her
hand
some
mad
proposition
that
would
undo
everything
.
<EOS>
faster
and
faster
go
the
sensitive
Meg
,
at
every
slight
sign
from
her
rider
,
till
the
canter
have
pass
into
a
swift
gallop
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
they

say
John

grimly
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
have
be
early
at
the
Chase
to
know
how
Arthur
be
,
and
have
be
relieve
from
all
anxiety
about
the
effect
of
his
blow
by
learn
that
he
be
go
out
for
a
ride
.
<EOS>
at
five
o'clock
he
be
punctually
there
again
,
and
send
up
word
of
his
arrival
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
Pym
come
down
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
and
give
it
to
Adam
,
say
that
the
captain
be
too
busy
to
see
him
,
and
have
write
everything
he
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
the
letter
be
direct
to
Adam
,
but
he
go
out
of
door
again
before
open
it
.
<EOS>
It
contain
a
seal
enclosure
direct
to
Hetty
.
<EOS>
on
the
inside
of
the
cover
Adam
read
:
   
"
in
the
enclosed
letter
I
have
write
everything
you
wish
.
<EOS>
I
leave
it
to
you
to
decide
whether
you
will
be
do
best
to
deliver
it
to
Hetty
or
to
return
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
ask
yourself
once
more
whether
you
be
not
take
a
measure
which
may
pain
her
more
than
mere
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
need
for
our
see
each
other
again
now

<EOS>
We
shall
meet
with
well
feeling
some
month
hence
.
  
<EOS>
"
A.D.

<EOS>
"
perhaps
he
be
i
<EOS>
'
th
'
right
on
'
t
not
to
see
me
,
"
think
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
no
use
meeting
to
say
more
hard
word
,
and
it
be
no
use
meeting
to
shake
hand
and
say
we
be
friend
again
.
<EOS>
We
be
not
friend
,
an
'
it
be
well
not
to
pretend
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
forgiveness
be
a
man
's
duty
,
but
,
<EOS>
to
my
thinking
,
that
can
only
mean
as
you
be
to
give
up
all
thought
o
'
take
revenge
:
it
can
never
mean
as
you
be
t

have
your
old
feeling
back
again
,
for
that
be
not
possible
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
the

man
to
me
,
and
I
can
not
feel
the

towards
him
.
<EOS>
God
help
me
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
I
feel
the
same
towards
anybody
:
I
seem
as
if
I
would
be
measure
my
work
from
a
false
line
,
and
have
get
it
all
to
measure
over
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
the
question
about
deliver
the
letter
to
Hetty
soon
absorb
Adam
's
thought
.
<EOS>
Arthur
have
procure
some
relief
to
himself
by
throw
the
decision
on
Adam
with
a
warning
;
and
Adam
,
who
be
not
give
to
hesitation
,
hesitate
here
.
<EOS>
He
determine
to
feel
his
way
 
to
ascertain
as
well
as
he
could
what
be
Hetty
's
state
of
mind
before
he
decide
on
deliver
the
letter
.
    
<EOS>
the
Delivery
of
the
Letter
  
<EOS>
the
next
Sunday
Adam
join
the
Poysers
on
their
way
out
of
church
,
hope
for
an
invitation
to
go
home
with
them
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
letter
in
his
pocket
,
and
be
anxious
to
have
an
opportunity
of
talk
to
Hetty
alone
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
see
her
face
at
church
,
for
she
have
change
her
seat
,
and
when
he
come
up
to
her
to
shake
hand
,
her
manner
be
doubtful
and
constrain
.
<EOS>
He
expect
this
,
for
it
be
the
first
time
she
have
meet
him
since
she
have
be
aware
that
he
have
see
her
with
Arthur
in
the
Grove
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
you
will
go
on
with
us
,
Adam
,
"
Mr.
Poyser
say
when
they
reach
the
turning
;
and
as
soon
as
they
be
in
the
field
Adam
venture
to
offer
his
arm
to
Hetty
.
<EOS>
the
child
soon
give
them
an
opportunity
of
linger
behind
a
little
,
and
then
Adam
say
:
  
"
Will
you
contrive
for
me
to
walk
out
in
the
garden
a
bit
with
you
this
evening
,
if
it
keep
fine
,
Hetty
?
<EOS>
I
have
something
partic'lar
to
talk
to
you
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
say
,
"
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
really
as
anxious
as
Adam
be
that
she
should
have
some
private
talk
with
him
.
<EOS>
She
wonder
what
he
think
of
her
and
Arthur
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
see
them
kiss
,
she
know
,
but
she
have
no
conception
of
the
scene
that
have
take
place
between
Arthur
and
Adam
.
<EOS>
Her
first
feeling
have
be
that
Adam
would
be
very
angry
with
her
,
and
perhaps
would
tell
her
aunt
and
uncle
,
but
it
never
enter
her
mind
that
he
would
dare
to
say
anything
to
Captain
Donnithorne
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
relief
to
her
that
he
behave
so
kindly
to
her
to
-
day
,
and
want
to
speak
to
her
alone
,
for
she
have
tremble
when
she
find
he
be
go
home
with
them
lest
he
should
mean
"
to
tell
.
<EOS>
"
but
,
now
he
want
to
talk
to
her
by
herself
,
she
should
learn
what
he
think
and
what
he
mean
to
do
.
<EOS>
She
feel
a
certain
confidence
that
she
could
persuade
him
not
to
do
anything
she
do
not
want
him
to
do
;
she
could
perhaps
even
make
him
believe
that
she
do
not
care
for
Arthur
;
and
as
long
as
Adam
think
there
be
any
hope
of
her
have
him
,
he
would
do
just
what
she
like
,
she
know
.
<EOS>
besides
,
she
MUST
go
on
seeming
to
encourage
Adam
,
lest
her
uncle
and
aunt
should
be
angry
and
suspect
her
of
have
some
secret
lover
.
  
<EOS>
Hetty
's
little
brain
be
busy
with
this
combination
as
she
hang
on
Adam
's
arm
and
say
"
yes
"
or
"
no
"
to
some
slight
observation
of
his
about
the
many
hawthorn
-
berry
there
would
be
for
the
bird
this
next
winter
,
and
the
low
-
hang
cloud
that
would
hardly
hold
up
till
morning
.
<EOS>
and
when
they
rejoin
her
aunt
and
uncle
,
she
could
pursue
her
thought
without
interruption
,
for
Mr.
Poyser
hold
that
though
a
young
man
may
like
to
have
the
woman
he
be
court
on
his
arm
,
he
would
nevertheless
be
glad
of
a
little
reasonable
talk
about
business
the
while
;
and
,
for
his
own
part
,
he
be
curious
to
hear
the
most
recent
news
about
the
Chase
Farm
.
<EOS>
so
,
through
the
rest
of
the
walk
,
he
claim
Adam
's
conversation
for
himself
,
and
Hetty
lay
her
small
plot
and
imagine
her
little
scene
of
cunne
blandishment
,
as
she
walk
along
by
the
hedgerow
on
honest
Adam
's
arm
,
quite
as
well
as
if
she
have
be
an
elegantly
clothe
coquette
alone
in
her
boudoir
.
<EOS>
for
if
a
country
beauty
in
clumsy
shoe
be
only
shallow
-
hearted
enough
,
it
be
astonish
how
closely
her
mental
process
may
resemble
those
of
a
lady
in
society
and
crinoline
,
who
apply
her
refined
intellect
to
the
problem
of
commit
indiscretion
without
compromise
herself
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
resemblance
be
not
much
the
less
because
Hetty
feel
very
unhappy
all
the
while
.
<EOS>
the
parting
with
Arthur
be
a
double
pain
to
her
 
mingle
with
the
tumult
of
passion
and
vanity
<EOS>
there
be
a
dim
undefined
fear
that
the
future
may
shape
itself
in
some
way
quite
unlike
her
dream
.
<EOS>
She
cling
to
the
comfort
hopeful
word
Arthur
have
utter
in
their
last
meeting
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
come
again
at
Christmas
,
and
then
we
will
see
what
can
be
do
.
"
<EOS>
She
cling
to
the
belief
that
he
be
so
fond
of
her
,
he
would
never
be
happy
without
her
;
and
she
still
hug
her
secret
 
that
a
great
gentleman
love
her
 
with
gratified
pride
,
as
a
superiority
over
all
the
girl
she
know
.
<EOS>
but
the
uncertainty
of
the
future
,
the
possibility
to
which
she
could
give
no
shape
,
begin
to
press
upon
her
like
the
invisible
weight
of
air
;
she
be
alone
on
her
little
island
of
dream
,
and
all
around
her
<EOS>
be
the
dark
unknown
water
where
Arthur
be
go
.
<EOS>
She
could
gather
no
elation
of
spirit
now
by
look
forward
,
but
only
by
look
backward
to
build
confidence
on
past
word
and
caress
.
<EOS>
but
occasionally
,
since
Thursday
evening
,
her
dim
anxiety
have
be
almost
lose
behind
the
more
definite
fear
that
Adam
may
betray
what
he
know
to
her
uncle
and
aunt
,
and
his
sudden
proposition
to
talk
with
her
alone
have
set
her
thought
to
work
in
a
new
way
.
<EOS>
She
be
eager
not
to
lose
this
evening
's
opportunity
;
and
after
tea
,
when
the
boy
be
go
into
the
garden
and
Totty
beg
to
go
with
them
,
Hetty
say
,
with
an
alacrity
that
surprise
Mrs.
Poyser
,
"
I
will
go
with
her
,
Aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
do
not
seem
at
all
surprising
that
Adam
say
he
would
go
too
,
and
soon
he
and
Hetty
be
leave
alone
together
on
the
walk
by
the
filbert
-
tree
,
while
the
boy
be
busy
elsewhere
gather
the
large
unripe
nut
to
play
at
"
cob
-
nut
"
with
,
and
Totty
be
watch
them
with
a
puppylike
air
of
contemplation
.
<EOS>
It
be
but
a
short
time
 
hardly
two
month
 
since
Adam
have
have
his
mind
fill
with
delicious
hope
as
he
stand
by
Hetty
's
side
in
this
garden
.
<EOS>
the
remembrance
of
that
scene
have
often
be
with
him
since
Thursday
evening
:
the
sunlight
through
the
apple
-
tree
bough
,
the
red
bunche
,
Hetty
's
sweet
blush
.
<EOS>
It
come
importunately
now
,
on
this
sad
evening
,
with
the
low
-
hang
cloud
,
but
he
try
to
suppress
it
,
lest
some
emotion
should
impel
him
to
say
more
than
be
needful
for
Hetty
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
"
after
what
I
see
on
Thursday
night
,
Hetty
,
"
he
begin
,
"
you
will
not
think
me
make
too
free
in
what
I
be
go
to

<EOS>
if

court
by
any
man

you
his

and
I
would
know
you

fond
of
him
and
mean
to
have
him
,
I
should
have
no
right
to
speak
a
word
to
you
about
it
;
but
when
I

you

make
love
to
by
a
gentleman
as

never

and
doesna

I

I
can
not

about
it
to
them
as

for
that
may

"
  
<EOS>
Adam
's
word
relieve
one
of
Hetty
's
fear
,
but
they
also
carry
a
meaning
which
sicken
her
with
a
strengthen
forebode
.
<EOS>
She
be
pale
and
tremble
,
and
yet
she
would
have
angrily
contradict
Adam
,
if
she
have
dare
to
betray
her
feeling
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
You

if

about
your

a

and
have
fine
present
from
him
,
they
would
speak
light
on
you

and
you
would
lose
your
character

<EOS>
and
besides
that
,
you
will
have
to
suffer
in
your
feeling

<EOS>
Adam
pause
and
look
at
Hetty
,
who
be
pluck
the
leave
from
the
filbert
-
tree
and
tear
them
up
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Her
little
plan
and
preconcerte
speech
have
all
forsake
her
,
like
an
ill
-
learn
lesson
,
under
the
terrible
agitation
produce
by
Adam
's
word
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
cruel
force
in
their
calm
certainty
which
threaten
to
grapple
and
crush
her
flimsy
hope
and
fancy
.
<EOS>
She
want
to
resist
them
 
she
want
to
throw
them
off
with
angry
contradiction
 
<EOS>
but
the
determination
to
conceal
what
she
feel
still
govern
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
nothing
more
than
a
blind
prompting
now
,
for
she
be
unable
to
calculate
the
effect
of
her
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
right
to
say

I
love
him

she
say
,
faintly
,
but
impetuously
,
pluck
another
rough
leaf
and
tear
it
up
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
beautiful
in
her
paleness
and
agitation
,
with
her
dark
childish
eye
dilate
and
her
breath
short
than
usual
.
<EOS>
Adam
's
heart
yearn
over
her
as
he
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
ah
,
if
he
could
but
comfort
her
,
and
soothe
her
,
and
save
her
from
this
pain
;
if
he
have
but
<EOS>
some
sort
of
strength
that
would
enable
him
to
rescue
her
poor
troubled
mind
,
as
he
would

rescue
her
body
in

all
danger

<EOS>
"
I
doubt
it
must
be
so
,
Hetty

"
he

,
tenderly
;
"
for
I
canna

<EOS>
the
terrible
decision
of
Adam

tone
shake
her
with
fear
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
presence
of
mind
leave
for
the
reflection
that
Arthur
would
have
his
reason
for
not
tell
the
truth
to
Adam
.
<EOS>
Her
word
and
look
be
enough
to
determine
Adam
:
he
must
give
her
the
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
can
not
believe
me
,
Hetty
,
because
you
think
too
well
of
him
 
because
you

he
love
you
better

<EOS>
but
I
have
get
a

before

at
the

a
letter
which
Adam

<EOS>
there
would
be
something
quite
different

<EOS>
Adam

out
the

he

in

Hetty

lay

She
take
no

she

when

loose
the
letter

she
put
it
into
her
pocket

without
open
it

and
then
begin
to
walk
more
quickly

"
You

Adam

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
read
it
when
you
be
by
yourself
.
<EOS>
but
stay
out
a
little
bit
longer
,
and
let
us
call
the
child
:
you
look
so
white
and
ill
,
your
aunt
may
take
notice
of
it

"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
hear
the
warning
.
<EOS>
It
recall
to
her
the
necessity
of
rally
her
native
power
of
concealment
,
which
have
half
give
way
under
the
shock
of
Adam
's
word
.
<EOS>
and
she
have
the
letter
in
her
pocket
:
she
be
sure
there
be
comfort
in
that
letter
in
spite
of
Adam

<EOS>
She
run
to
find
Totty

and
soon
reappear
with
recovered
colour

lead
Totty
,
who
be
make
a
sour
face

away
an
unripe
apple
that

her
small
tooth

what
little

ever
refuse
to
be
comfort
by
that
glorious
sense

strongly

swing
upward

<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
Ganymede
cry
when
the
eagle
carry
him
away
,
and
perhaps
deposit
him
on
Jove
's
shoulder
at
the
end

<EOS>
Totty
smile
down
complacently
from
her
secure
height
,
and
pleasant
be
the
sight
to
the
mother
's
eye
,
as
she
stand
at
the
house
door
and
see
Adam
come
with
his
small
burden

<EOS>
"
bless
your
sweet
face

my
pet

she
say
,
the
mother
's
strong
love
fill
her
keen
eye
with
mildness
,
as
Totty
lean
forward
and
put
out
her
arm
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
eye
for
Hetty
at
that
moment
,
and
only
say
,
without
look
at
her
,
"
You
go
and
draw
some
ale
,
Hetty
;
the
gell
be
both
at
the
cheese
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
the
ale
have
be
draw
and
her
uncle
's
pipe
light
,
there
be
Totty
to
be
take
to
bed
,
and
bring
down
again
in
her
night
-
gown
because
she
would
cry
instead
of
go
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
supper
to
be
get
ready
,
and
Hetty
must
be
continually
in
the
way
to
give
help
.
<EOS>
Adam
stay
till
he
know
Mrs.
Poyser
expect
him
to
go
,
engage
her
and
her
husband
in
talk
as
constantly
as
he
could
,
for
the
sake
of
leave
Hetty
more
at
ease
.
<EOS>
He
linger
,
because
he
want
to
see
her
safely
through
that
evening
,
and
he
be
delighted
to
find
how
much
self
-
command
she
show
.
<EOS>
He
know
she
have
not
have
time
to
read
the
letter
,
but
he
do
not
know
she
be
buoy
up
by
a
secret
hope
that
the
letter
would
contradict
everything
he
have
say
.
<EOS>
It
be
hard
work
for
him
to
leave
her
 
hard
to
think
that
he
should
not
know
for
day
how
she
be
bear
her
trouble
.
<EOS>
but
he
must
go
at
last
,
and
all
he
could
do
be
to
press
her
hand
gently
as
he
say
"
good
-
bye
,
"
and
hope
she
would
take
that
as
a
sign
that
if
his
love
could
ever
be
a
refuge
for
her
,
it
be
there
the
same
as
ever
.
<EOS>
how
busy
his
thought
be
,
as
he
walk
home
,
in
devise
pity
excuse
for
her
folly
,
in
refer
all
her
weakness
to
the
sweet
lovingness
of
her
nature
,
in
blame
Arthur
,
with
less
and
less
inclination
to
admit
that
his
conduct
may
be
extenuate
too
!
<EOS>
His
exasperation
at
Hetty
's
suffering
 
and
also
at
the
sense
that
she
be
possibly
thrust
for
ever
out
of
his
own
reach
 
deafen
him
to
any
plea
for
the
miscalled
friend
who
have
work
this
misery
.
<EOS>
Adam
be
a
clear
-
sighted
,
fair
-
minded
man
 
a
fine
fellow
,
indeed
,
morally
as
well
as
physically
.
<EOS>
but
if
aristide
the
just
be
ever
in
love
and
jealous
,
he
be
at
that
moment
not
perfectly
magnanimous
.
<EOS>
and
I
can
not
pretend
that
Adam
,
in
these
painful
day
,
feel
nothing
but
righteous
indignation
and
love
pity
.
<EOS>
He
be
bitterly
jealous
,
and
in
proportion
as
his
love
make
him
indulgent
in
his
judgment
of
Hetty
,
the
bitterness
find
a
vent
in
his
feeling
towards
Arthur
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
head
be
allays
likely
to

turn
,
"
he
think
,
"
when
a
gentleman
,
with
his
fine
manner
,

fine
clothe
,
and
his
white
hand
,
and
that
way
o
'
talk
gentlefolk
have
,
come
about
her
,
make
up
to
her
in
a
bold
way
,
as
a
man
could
not
do
that
be
only
her
equal
;
and
it
be
much
if
she
will
ever
like
a
common
man
now
.
<EOS>
"
He
could
not
help
draw
his
own
hand
out
of
his
pocket

look
at
them
 
at
the
hard
palm
and
the
broken
finger

<EOS>
"
I
be
a
roughish
fellow
,
altogether
;
I
do
not
know

now
I
come
to

on't
,
what
there
be
much
for
a
woman
to
like
about
me
;
and
yet
I
may
ha
'
get
another
wife
easy
enough
,
if
I
have
not

my

on
her

it
be
little

what
other
woman
think
about
me
,
if
she
can
not

me

<EOS>
She
may
ha

me

perhaps
,
as
likely

there
be
nobody
hereabouts
as
I
be
afraid
of
,
if
he

between

now
I
shall
belike
be
hateful
to
her
because
I
be
so
different
to
him

yet
there
be
no
telling
 
<EOS>
she
may
turn
round
the
other
way
,
when
she
find
he
be
make
light
of
her
all
the

<EOS>
She
may
come
to
feel
the
vally
of
a
man
as
'

be
thankful
to
be
bind
to
her
all
his
life

I
must
put
up
with
it
whichever
way
<EOS>
it
be
 
I
have
only
to
be
thankful
it

be
no

I

it

go
near

through
the

He

after

with
John

who
have
lately
profess
himself
in

I
would
a
question

ask
him
about

It

<EOS>
They
walk
along
together
in
silence
two

three
minute
.
<EOS>
Adam
be
not
inclined
to
enter
into
the
subtlety
of
religious
experience
,
but
he
be
incline
to
interchange
a
word
or
two
of
brotherly
affection
and
confidence
with
Seth
.
<EOS>
that
be
a
rare
impulse
in
him
,
much
as
the
brother
love
each
other
.
<EOS>
They
hardly
ever
speak
of
personal
matter
,
or
utter
more
than
an
allusion
to
their
family
trouble
.
<EOS>
Adam
be
by
nature
reserve
in
all

of
feeling
,
and
Seth
feel
a
certain
timidity
towards
his
more
practical
brother

I

<EOS>
dear
BROTHER
SETH
 
<EOS>
Your
letter
lie
three
day
beyond
my
knowing
of
it
at
the
post
,
for
I
have
not
money
enough
by
me
to
pay
the
carriage
,
<EOS>
this
be
a
time
of
great
need
and
sickness
here
,
with
the
rain
that
have
fall
,
as
if
the
window
of
heaven
be
open
again
;
and
to
lay
by
money
,
from
day
to
day
,
in
such
a
time
,
when
there
be
so
many
in
present
need
of
all
thing
,
would
be
a
want
of
trust
like
the
laying
up
of
the
manna
.
<EOS>
I
speak
of
this
,
because
I
would
not
have
you
think
me
slow
to
answer
,
or
that
I
have
small
joy
in
your
rejoicing
at
the
worldly
good
that
have
befall
your
brother
Adam
.
<EOS>
the
honour
and
love
you
bear
him
be
nothing
but
meet
,
for
God
have
give
him
great
gift
,
and
he
use
them
as
the
patriarch
Joseph
do
,
who
,
when
he
be
exalt
to
a
place
of
power
and
trust
,
yet
yearn
with
tenderness
towards
his
parent
and
his
young
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
heart
be
knit
to
your
aged
mother
since
it
be
grant
me
to
be
near
her
in
the
day
of
trouble
.
<EOS>
speak
to
her
of
me
,
and
tell
her
I
often
bear
her
in
my
thought
at
evening
time
,
when
I
be
sit
in
the
dim
light
as
I
do
with
her
,
and
we
hold
one
another
's
hand
,
and
I
speak
the
word
of
comfort
that
be
give
to
me
.
<EOS>
ah
,
that
be
a
bless
time
,
be
not
it
,
Seth
,
when
the
outward
light
be
fade
,
and
the
body
be
a
little
wearied
with
its
work
and
its
labour
.
<EOS>
then
the
inward
light
shine
the
bright
,
and
we
have
a
deep
sense
of
rest
on
the
Divine
strength
.
<EOS>
I
sit
on
my
chair
in
the
dark
room
and
close
my
eye
,
and
it
be
as
if
I
be
out
of
the
body
and
could
feel
no
want
for
evermore
.
<EOS>
for
then
,
the
very
hardship
,
and
the
sorrow
,
and
the
blindness
,
and
the
sin
I
have
behold
and
be
ready
to
weep
over
 
yea
,
all
the
anguish
of
the
child
of
man
,
which
sometimes
wrap
me
round
like
sudden
darkness
 
I
can
bear
with
a
willing
pain
,
as
if
I
be
share
the
Redeemer
's
cross
.
<EOS>
for
I
feel
it
<EOS>
,
I
feel
it
 
infinite
love
be
suffer
too
 
yea
,
in
the
fulness
of
knowledge
<EOS>
it
suffer
,
it
yearn
,
it
mourn
;
and
that
be
a
blind
self
-
seeking
which
want
to
be
free
from
the
sorrow
wherewith
the
whole
creation
groaneth
and
travaileth
.
<EOS>
surely
it
be
not
true
blessedness
to
be
free
from
sorrow
,
while
there
be
sorrow
and
sin
in
the
world
:
sorrow
be
then
a
part
of
love
,
and
love
do
not
seek
to
throw
it
off
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
spirit
only
that
tell
me
this
 
<EOS>
I
see
it
in
the
whole
work
and
word
of
the
Gospel
.
<EOS>
be
there
not
plead
in
heaven
?
<EOS>
be
not
the
Man
of
Sorrows
there
in
that
crucify
body
wherewith
he
ascend
?
<EOS>
and
be
He
not
one
with
the
Infinite
Love
itself
 
as
our
love
be
one
with
our
sorrow
?
  
<EOS>
"
these
thought
have
be
much
borne
in
on
me
of
late
,
and
I
have
see
with
new
clearness
the
meaning
of
those
word
,
"
if
any
man
love
me
,
let
him
take
up
my
cross

Slowly
Hetty
have
read

letter

and
when
she
look
up
from

there
be
the
reflection
of
a
blanched
face
in
the
old
dim
glass
 
a
white
marble
face
with
rounded
childish
form
,
but
with
something
sad
than
a
child

pain
in
it

Hetty
do
not
see
the
face

she
see
nothing

only

that

sick

trembling

the
letter
shake
and
rustle
in

hand

She
lay
it
down

<EOS>
It
be
a
horrible
sensation
 
this
cold
and
trembling

It
sweep
away
the
very
idea

produce
it

and
Hetty
get
up
to
reach
a
warm
cloak

clothe

press

wrap
it
round
her
,
and
sit
as

she
be
think
of
nothing

get
warm
.

presently
she
take
up
the
letter
with
a
firm
hand
,
and
begin
to
read
it
through
again
.
<EOS>
the
tear
come
this
time
 
great
rushing
tear
that
blind
her
and
blotch
the
paper

<EOS>
She
feel
nothing
but
that
Arthur

cruel
 
cruel

so

cruel
not

<EOS>
reason
why
he
could
not
marry

have
no
existence

how
could

believe
in
any
misery
that
could
come
to
her
from
the
fulfilment
of
all
she
have
be
long
for
and

<EOS>
She
have
not
the
idea
that
could
make
up

notion
of
that
misery

<EOS>
as
she
throw
down
the
letter
again
,
she
catch
sight
of
her
face
in
the
glass
;
it
be
redden
now
,
and
wet
with
tear
;
it
be
almost
like
a
companion
that
she
may
complain
to
 
that
would
pity
her
.
<EOS>
She
lean
forward
on
her
elbow
,
and
look
into
those
dark
overflooding
eye
and
at
the
quivering
mouth
,
and
see
how
the
tear
come
thick
and
thick
,
and
how
the
mouth
become
convulse
with
sobs
.
  
<EOS>
the
shattering
of
all

little
dream

world

the
crush
blow
on

new

bear
passion

afflict
her
pleasure

crave
nature
with
an
overpower
pain
that
annihilate
all
impulse
to
resistance
,
and
suspend
her
anger
.
<EOS>
She
sit
sob
till
the
candle
go
out
,
and
then
,
weary
,
ache
,
stupefy
with
crying
,
throw
herself
on
the
bed
without
undress
and
go
to
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
feeble
dawn
in
the
room
when
Hetty
awake
,
a
little
after
four
o'clock
,
with
a
sense
of
dull
misery
,
<EOS>
the
cause
of
which
break
upon
her
gradually
as
she
begin
to
discern
the
object
round
her
in
the
dim
light
.
<EOS>
and
then
come
the
frightening
thought
that
she
have
to
conceal
her
misery
as
well
as
to
bear
it
,
in
this
dreary
daylight
that
be
come

<EOS>
She
could
lie
no
longer
.
<EOS>
She
get
up
and
go
towards
the
table
:
there
lie
the
letter
.
<EOS>
She
open
her
treasure
-
drawer
:
there
lay
the
ear
-
ring
and
the
locket
 
<EOS>
the
sign
of
all
her
short
happiness
 
<EOS>
the
sign
of
the
lifelong
dreariness
that
be
to
follow
it
.
<EOS>
look
at
the
little
trinket
which
she
have
once
eye
and
finger
so
fondly
as
the
earnest
of
her
future
paradise
of
finery

live
back
in
the
moment
when
they
have
be
give
to
her
with
such
tender
caress
,
such
strangely
pretty
word
,
such
glowing
look
,
which
fill
her
with
a
bewilder
delicious
surprise
 
<EOS>
they
be
so
much
sweet
than
she
have
think
anything
could
be
.
<EOS>
and
the
Arthur
who
have
speak
to
her
and
look
at
her
in
this
way
,
who
be
present
with
her
now
 
whose
arm
she
feel
round
her
,
his
cheek
against
her
<EOS>
,
his
very
breath
upon
her
 
be
the
cruel
,
cruel
Arthur
who
have
write
that
letter
,
that
letter
which
she
snatch
and
crush
and
then
open
again
,
that
she
may
read
it
once
more
.
<EOS>
the
half
-
benumbed
mental
condition
which
be
the
effect
of
the
last
night
's
violent
crying
make
it
necessary
to
her
to
look
again
and
see
if
her
wretched
thought
be
actually
true
 
if
the
letter
be
really
so
cruel
.
<EOS>
She
have
to
hold
it
close
to
the
window
,
else
she
could
not
have
read
it
by
the
faint
light
.
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
It
be
bad
 
<EOS>
it
be
more
cruel
.
<EOS>
She
crush
it
up
again
in
anger
.
<EOS>
She
hate
the
writer
of
that
letter
 
hate
him
for
the
very
reason
that
she
hang
upon
him
with
all
her
love
 
all
the
girlish
passion
and
vanity
that
make
up
her
love
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
no
tear
this
morning
.
<EOS>
She
have
weep
them
all
away
last
night
,
and
now
she
feel
that
dry
-
eyed
morning
misery
,
which
be
bad
than
the
first
shock
because
it
have
the
future
in
it
as
well
as
the
present
.
<EOS>
every
morning
to
come
,
as
far
as
her
imagination
could
stretch
,
she
would
have
to
get
up
and
feel
that
the
day
would
have
no
joy
for
her
.
<EOS>
for
there
be
no
despair
<EOS>
so
absolute
as
that
which
come
with
the
first
moment
of
our
first
great
sorrow
,
when
we
have
not
yet
know
what
it
be
to
have
suffer
and
be
heal
,
to
have
despair
and
to
have
recover
hope
.
<EOS>
as
Hetty
begin
languidly
to
take
off
the
clothe
she
have
wear
all
the
night
,
that
she
may
wash
herself
and
brush
her
hair
,
she
have
a
sickening
sense
that
her
life
would
go
on
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
She
should
always
be
do
thing
she
have
no
pleasure
in
,
get
up
to
the
old
task
of
work
,
see
people
she
care
nothing
about
,
go
to
church
,
and
to
Treddleston
,
and
to
tea
with
Mrs.
Best
,
and
carry
no
happy
thought
with
her
.
<EOS>
for
her
short
poisonous
delight
have
spoil
for
ever
all
the
little
joy
that
have
once
make
the
sweetness
of
her
life
 
the
new
frock
ready
for
Treddleston
Fair
,
the
party
at
Mr.
Britton
's
at
Broxton
wake
,
the
beaux
that
she
would
say
"
no
"
to
for
a
long
while
,
and
the
prospect
of
the
wedding
that
be
to
come
at
last
when
she
would
have
a
silk
gown
and
a
great
many
clothe
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
these
thing
be
all
flat
and
dreary
to
her
now
;
everything
would
be
a
weariness
,
and
she
would
carry
about
for
ever
a
hopeless
thirst
and
longing
.
  
<EOS>
She
pause
in
the
midst
of
her
languid
undressing
and
lean
against
the
dark
old
clothe
-
press
.
<EOS>
Her
neck
and
arm
be
bare
,
her
hair
hang
down
in
delicate
ring
 
<EOS>
and
they
be
just
as
beautiful
as
they
be
that
night
two
month
ago
,
when
she
walk
up
and
down
this
bed
-
chamber
glowing
with
vanity
and
hope
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
think
of
her
neck
and
arm
now
;
even
her
own
beauty
be
indifferent
to
her
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
wander
sadly
over
the
dull
old
chamber
,
and
then
look
out
vacantly
towards
the
grow
dawn
.
<EOS>
do
a
remembrance
of
Dinah
come
across
her
mind
?
<EOS>
of
her
foreboding
word
,
which
have
make
her
angry
?
<EOS>
of
Dinah
's
affectionate
entreaty
to
think
of
her
as
a
friend
in
trouble
?
<EOS>
no
,
the
impression
have
be
too
slight
to
recur
.
<EOS>
any
affection
or
comfort
Dinah
could
have
give
her
would
have
be
as
indifferent
to
Hetty
this
morning
as
everything
else
be
except
her
bruise
passion
.
<EOS>
She
be
only
think
she
could
never
stay
here
and
go
on
with
the
old
life
 
she
could
better
bear
something
quite
new
than
sink
back
into
the
old
everyday
round
.
<EOS>
She
would
like
to
run
away
that
very
morning
,
and
never
see
any
of
the
old
face
again
.
<EOS>
but
Hetty
's
be
not
a
nature
to
face
difficulty
 
to
dare
to
loose
her
hold
on
the
familiar
and
rush
blindly
on
some
unknown
condition
.
<EOS>
her
be
a
luxurious
and
vain
nature
 
<EOS>
not
a
passionate
one
 
<EOS>
and
if
she
be
ever
to
take
any
violent
measure
,
she
must
be
urge
to
it
by
the
desperation
of
terror
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
much
room
for
her
thought
to
travel
in
the
narrow
circle
of
her
imagination
,
and
she
soon
fix
on
the
one
thing
she
would
do
to
get
away
from
her
old
life
:
she
would
ask
her
uncle
to
let
her
go
to
be
a
lady
's
maid
.
<EOS>
Miss
Lydia
's
maid
would
help
her
to
get
a
situation
,
if
she
know
Hetty
have
her
uncle
's
leave
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
have
think
of
this
,
she
fasten
up
her
hair
and
begin
to
wash
:
it
seem
more
possible
to
her
to
go
downstairs
and
try
to
behave
as
usual
.
<EOS>
She
would
ask
her
uncle
this
very
day
.
<EOS>
on
Hetty
's
bloom
health
it
would
take
a
great
deal
of
such
mental
suffering
as
her
to
leave
any
deep
impress
;
and
when
she
be
dress
as
neatly
as
usual
in
her
working
-
dress
,
with
her
hair
tuck
up
under
her
little
cap
,
an
indifferent
observer
would
have
be
more
strike
with
the
young
roundness
of
her
cheek
and
neck
and
the
darkness
of
her
eye
and
eyelash
than
with
any
sign
of
sadness
about
her
.
<EOS>
but
when
she
take
up
the
crushed
letter
and
put
it
in
her
drawer
,
that
she
may
lock
it
out
of
sight
,
hard
smart
tear
,
have
no
relief
in
them
as
the
great
drop
have
that
fall
last
night
,
force
their
way
into
her
eye
.
<EOS>
She
wipe
them
away
quickly
:
she
must
not
cry
in
the
day
-
time
.
<EOS>
nobody
should
find
out
how
miserable
she
be
,
nobody
should
know
she
be
disappointed
about
anything
;
and
the
thought
that
the
eye
of
her
aunt
and
uncle
would
be
upon
her
give
her
the
self
-
command
which
often
accompany
a
great
dread
.
<EOS>
for
Hetty
look
out
from
her
secret
misery
towards
the
possibility
of
their
ever
know
what
have
happen
,
as
the
sick
and
weary
prisoner
may
think
of
the
possible
pillory
.
<EOS>
They
would
think
her
conduct
shameful
,
and
shame
be
torture
.
<EOS>
that
be
poor
little
Hetty
's
conscience
.
  
<EOS>
so
she
lock
up
her
drawer
and
go
away
to
her
early
work
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
evening
,
when
Mr.
Poyser
be
smoke
his
pipe
,
and
his
good
-
nature
be
therefore
at
its
superlative
moment
,
Hetty
seize
the
opportunity
of
her
aunt
's
absence
to
say
,
"
Uncle
,
I
wish
you
would
let
me
go
for
a
lady
's
maid
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
take
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
look
at
Hetty
in
mild
surprise
for
some
moment
.
<EOS>
She
be
sew
,
and
go
on
with
her
work
industriously
.
  
<EOS>
"
why

into
your

"
he
say
at

Mr.

and

away
at
his
pipe
.
  
<EOS>
"
I

Her

have
have
another
effect
on
Hetty
besides
that
of
disappoint
her
and
make
her
cry

<EOS>
She
know
quite
well
whom
he
have
in
his
mind
in
his
allusion
to
marriage
,
and
to
a
sober
,
solid
husband
;
and
when
she
be
in

bedroom
again
,
the
possibility
of
her
marry
Adam
present
itself
to
her
in
a
new
light
.
<EOS>
in
a
mind
where
no
strong
sympathy

at

where
there
be
no
supreme
sense
of
right
to
which
the
agitate
nature
can
cling
and
steady
itself
to
quiet
endurance
,
one
of
the
first
result
of
sorrow
be
a
desperate
vague
clutching
after
any
deed
that
will
change
the
actual

<EOS>
poor
Hetty
's
vision
of
consequence
,
at
no
time
more
than
a
narrow
fantastic
calculation
of
her
own
probable
pleasure
and
pain
,
be
now
quite
shut
out
by
reckless
irritation
under
present
suffering
,
and
she
be
ready
for
one
of
those
convulsive
,
motiveless
action
by
which
wretche
man
and
woman
leap
from
a
temporary
sorrow
into
a
lifelong
misery

<EOS>
why
should
she

<EOS>
She
do
not

so
that
it
make
some
change

<EOS>
She
feel
confident
that

<EOS>
"
strange

"
<EOS>
perhaps
you
will
say
,
"
this
rush

yes
,
the
action
of
a
little
trivial
soul
like
Hetty
's
,
struggle
amidst
the
serious
sad
destiny
of
a
human
being
,
be
strange
.
<EOS>
so
be
the
motion
of
a
little
vessel
without
ballast
toss
about
on
a
stormy
sea
.
<EOS>
how
pretty
it
look
with
its
parti

coloured

moor
in

"
let

Mrs.

the

Saturday
evening
there

much
excited

an
incident
which
have
occur
that
very

no
less
than
a
second
appearance
of
the
smart
man
in

boot
say
by
some
to
be
a
mere
farmer
in
treaty
for
the
Chase
Farm
,
by
other
to
be
the
future
steward
,
but
by
Mr.
Casson
himself
,
the
personal
witness
to
the
stranger
's
visit
,
pronounce
contemptuously
to
be
nothing
well
than
a
bailiff
,
such
as
Satchell
have
be
before
him

<EOS>
no
one
have
think
of
deny
Mr.

testimony
to
the
fact
that
he
have
see
the
stranger

nevertheless

he
proffer
various
corroborate
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I

I

him

"
You

just

I

,
"

I

for
I
want
to
hear
the
turn
of
his

I
may
know

Mr.

have
the

wisely
fall
back

It
be
probably
owe
to
the
conversation
she
have
have
with
her
husband
on

way
from

concern
this
problematic
stranger
that
Mrs.

immediately
revert
to

when

a
day
or
two
afterwards
,
as
she
be

<EOS>
in

eager
leisure

come

she

the
old
squire
enter
the
yard
on
his
black
pony

follow
by
John
the
groom

<EOS>
She
always
cite
it
afterwards
as
a
case
of
prevision

which
really
have
something
more
in
it
than
her
own
remarkable
penetration

<EOS>
that
the
moment
she
set
eye
on
the
squire
she
say
to
herself
,
"
I
shouldna

<EOS>
something
unwonted
must
clearly
be
in

,
for
the
old

visit

though
Mrs.

have
during

Mr.

have
just
enter
in
shirt

open
waistcoat
,
with
a
face
a
shade
red

from

exertion

as

,
red

rotund

and
radiant
,
before
the
small

wiry

cool

he
look
like
a

apple
by

side
of
a
withered
crab

<EOS>
"
Will

be
far
from

for

with

management

I

as
you

.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
sir

I
can
not

say
Mrs.
Poyser
in
a
hard
voice
,
rolling
and
unroll
her
knitting
and
look
icily
out
of
the
window
,
as
she
continue
to
stand
opposite
the
squire

<EOS>
Poyser
may
sit
down
if
he
like
,
she
think

she
be
not
go
to

down

as
if
she

in

any

smooth

tongued
palaver

<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
,
who
look
and
feel
the
reverse
of
icy
,
do
sit
down
in
his
three

corner
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
Poyser
,
as
Satchell
be
lay
up
,
I
be
intend
to
let
the
Chase
Farm
to
a
respectable
tenant

<EOS>
I
be
tired
of
have
a

nothing

the
good
of
in
such
case
,
as
you
know

<EOS>
a
satisfactory
bailiff
be
hard
to
find
;
and
I
think
you
and
I
,
Poyser
,
and
your
excellent
wife
here
,
can
enter
into
a
little
arrangement
in
consequence
,
which
will
be
to
our
mutual
advantage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
"
say
Mr.
Poyser
,
with
a
good
-
natured
blankness
of
imagination
as
to
the
nature
of
the
arrangement
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
be
call
upon
to
speak
,
sir

"
say
Mrs.
Poyser
,
after
glance
at
her
husband
with
pity
at
his
softness
,
"
you
know
better
than
me
;

I
do
not

what
the
Chase
Farm

we
have
cumber
enough
<EOS>
wi

<EOS>
not

what
I
be
glad
to
hear
o

<EOS>
anybody
respectable

there

as

"
  
<EOS>

You
be
likely
to
find
Mr.

an
excellent
neighbour

I
assure
you
 
such
a
one
as
you
will
feel
glad
to
have
accommodate
by
the
little
plan
I
be
go
to
mention
,
especially
as
I
hope
you
will
find
it
as
much
to
your

his

<EOS>

indeed

sir

if
it

anything

advantage

it
will
be
the
first
offer

the
sort
I
have

<EOS>
It
be
them
as
take
advantage
that

<EOS>
this

I
think

folk
have
to

<EOS>
long
enough
afore

it

bring
to

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
fact
be
,
Poyser
,
"
say
the
squire
,
ignore
Mrs.
Poyser
's
theory
of
worldly
prosperity
,
"
there
be
too
much
dairy
land
,
and
too
little
plough
land
,
on
the
Chase
Farm
to
suit
Thurle
's
purpose
 
indeed
<EOS>
,
he
will
only
take
the
farm
on
condition
of
some
change
in
it
:
his
wife
,
it
appear
,
be
not
a
clever
dairy
-
woman
,
like
yours
.
<EOS>
now
,
the
plan
I
be
think
of
be
to
effect
a
little
exchange
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
to
have
the
Hollow
Pastures
,
you
may
increase
your
dairy
,
which
must
be
so
profitable
under
your
wife
's
management
;
and
I
should
request
you
,
Mrs.
Poyser
,
to
supply
my
house
with
milk
,
cream
,
and
butter
at
the
market
price
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
Poyser
,
you
may
let
Thurle
have
the
low
and
Upper
Ridges
,
which
really
,
with
our
wet
season
,
would
be
a
good
riddance
for
you
.
<EOS>
there
be
much
less
risk
in
dairy
land
than
corn
land
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
be
lean
forward
,
with
his
elbow
on
his
knee
,
his
head
on
one
side
,
and
his
mouth
screw
up
 
apparently
absorb
in
make
the
tip
of
his
finger
meet
so
as
to
represent
with
perfect
accuracy
the
rib
of
a
ship
.
<EOS>
He
be
much
too
acute
a
man
not
to
see
through
the
whole
business
,
and
to
foresee
perfectly
what
would
be
his
wife
's
view
of
the
subject
;
but
he
dislike
give
unpleasant
answer
.
<EOS>
unless
it
be
on
a
point
of
farming
practice
,
he
would
rather
give
up
than
have
a
quarrel
,
any
day
;
and
,
after
all
,
it
matter
more
to
his
wife
than
to
him
.
<EOS>
so
,
after
a
few
moment
'
silence
,
he
look
up
at
her
and
say
mildly
,
"
what
dost
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
have
have
her
eye
fix
on
her
husband
with
cold
severity
during
his
silence
,
but
now
she
turn
away
her
head
with
a
toss
,
look
icily
at
the
opposite
roof
of
the
cow
-
shed
,
and
spear
her
knit
together
with
the
loose
pin

hold
it
firmly
between

clasped

say

<EOS>
why
,
I
say
you
may
do
as
you
like
about
give
up
any
o

your
corn

land
afore
<EOS>
your
lease
be
up
,
which
it
will
not
be
for
a
year
come
next
Michaelmas
,
but
I
will
not
consent
to
take
more
dairy
work
into
my
hand
,
either
for
love

money
;
and
there
be
nayther

I
can
see

I

there

<EOS>

Mrs.

it

I
will
not

worret
myself

"
  
<EOS>
"
no

no

my
dear
Mrs.
Poyser
,
certainly
not
,
"
say
the
squire
,
still
confident
in
his
own
power
of
persuasion
,
"
you
must
not
overwork
yourself
;
but
do
not
you

your
work
will
rather

lessen
than
increase
in
this
way
?
<EOS>
there
be
so
much
milk
require
at
the
Abbey
that
you
will
have
little
increase
of
cheese
and
butter
make
from
the
addition
to
your
dairy
;
and
I
believe
sell
the
milk
be
the
most
profitable
way
of
dispose
of
dairy
produce

be
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
aye
,
that
be
true

say
Mr.
Poyser
,
unable
to
repress
an
opinion
on
a
question
of
farm
profit
,
and
forget
that
it
be
not
in
this
case
a
purely
abstract
question

<EOS>
"
I
daresay
,
"
say
Mrs.
Poyser
bitterly
,
turn
her
head
half

way
towards
her
husband

look
at
the
vacant

it

shift
his

suddenly
withdraw
from
the
proceeding

"

it
be

I

it

be
a
bad

turn
them
out

say
Mrs.

"
oh
,
that

be
likely

think
twice

digest
his

turn

out

if
he
should
give

Arthur

It
strike
me
on
Arthur

birthday
that
the

be
a
little
shaken
:
he
be
eighty

three
,
you
know

It
be
really
an
unconscionable
age

long

that

Mr.

laughing
,
and
kiss
his
mother

hand

<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
,
too
,
meet
her
husband
's
occasional
foreboding
of
a
notice
to
quit
with
"
there
be
no
knowing
what
may
happen
before
Lady
day
"
 
one
of
those
undeniable
general
proposition
which
be
usually
intend
to
convey
a
particular
meaning
very
far
from
undeniable
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
really
too
hard
upon
human
nature
that
it
should
be
hold
a
criminal
offence
to
imagine
the
death
even
of
the
king
when
he
be
turn
eighty
-
three
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
believe
that
any
but
the
dull
briton
can
be
good
subject
under
that
hard
condition

<EOS>
apart
from
this
forebode
,
thing
go
on
much
as
usual
in
the
Poyser
household
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
think
she
notice
a
surprising
improvement
in
Hetty
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
the
girl
get
"
close
temper
,
and
sometimes
she
seem
as
if
there
'd
be
no
draw
a
word
from
her
with
cart
-
rope
,
"
but
she
think
much
less
about
her
dress
,
and
go
after
the
work
quite
eagerly
,
without
any
telling
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
wonderful
how
she
never
want
to
go
out
now
 
indeed
,
could
hardly
be
persuade
to
go
;
and
she
bear
her
aunt
's
put
a
stop
to
her
weekly
lesson
in
fine
-
work
at
the
Chase
without
the
least
grumbling
or
pouting
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
,
after
all
,
that
she
have
set
her
heart
on
Adam
at
last
,
and
her
sudden
freak
of
want
to
be
a
lady
's
maid
must
have
be
cause
by
some
little
pique
or
misunderstanding
between
them
,
which
have
pass
by
.
<EOS>
for
whenever
Adam
come
to
the
Hall
Farm
,
Hetty
seem
to
be
in
well
spirit
and
to
talk
more
than
at
other
time
,
though
she
be
almost
sullen
when
Mr.
Craig
or
any
other
admirer
happen
to
pay
a
visit
there
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
himself
watch
her
at
first
with
tremble
anxiety
,
which
give
way
to
surprise
and
delicious
hope
.
<EOS>
five
day
after
deliver
Arthur
's
letter
,
he
have
venture
to
go
to
the
Hall
Farm
again
 
not
without
dread
lest
the
sight
of
him
may
be
painful
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
in
the
house
-
place
when
he
enter
,
and
he
sit
talk
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Poyser
for
a
few
minute
with
a
heavy
fear
on
his
heart
that
they
may
presently
tell
him
Hetty
be
ill
.
<EOS>
but
by
and
by
there
come
a
light
step
that
he
know
,
and
when
Mrs.
Poyser
say
,
"
come
,
Hetty
,
where
have
you
be
?
"
<EOS>
Adam
be
oblige
to
turn
round
,
though
he
be
afraid
to
see
the
change
look
there
must
be
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
He
almost
start
when
he
see
her
smile
as
if
she
be
pleased
to
see
him
 
look
the
same
as
ever
at
a
first
glance
,
only
that
she
have
her
cap
on
,
which
he
have
never
see
her
in
before
when
he
come
of
an
evening
.
<EOS>
still
,
when
he
look
at
her
again
and
again
as
she
move
about
or
sit
at
her
work
,
there
be
a
change
:
the
cheek
be
as
pink
as
ever
,
and
she
smile
as
much
as
she
have
ever
do
of
late
,
but
there
be
something
different
in
her
eye
,
in
the
expression
of
her
face
,
in
all
her
movement
<EOS>
,
Adam
think
 
something
harder
,
old
,
less
child
-
like
.
"
<EOS>
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
say
to
himself
,
"
that
be
allay
likely
.
<EOS>
It
be
because
she
be
have
her
first
heartache
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
get
a
spirit
to
bear
up
under
it
.
<EOS>
thank
God
for
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
the
week
go
by
,
and
he
see
her
always
look
pleased
to
see
him
 
turn
up
her
lovely
face
towards
him
as
if
she
mean
him
to
understand
that
she
be
glad
for
him
to
come
 
and
go
about
her
work
in
the
same
equable
way
,
make
no
sign
of
sorrow
<EOS>
,
he
begin
to
believe
that
her
feeling
towards
Arthur
must
have
be
much
slighter
than
he
have
imagine
in
his
first
indignation
and
alarm
,
and
that
she
have
be
able
to
think
of
her
girlish
fancy
that
Arthur
be
in
love
with
her
and
would
marry
her
as
a
folly
of
which
she
be
timely
cure
.
<EOS>
and
it
perhaps
be
,
as
he
have
sometimes
in
his
more
cheerful
moment
hope
it
would
be
 
<EOS>
her
heart
be
really
turn
with
all
the
more
warmth
towards
the
man
she
know
to
have
a
serious
love
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
possibly
you
think
that
Adam
be
not
at
all
sagacious
in
his
interpretation
,
and
that
it
be
altogether
extremely
unbecoming
in
a
sensible
man
to
behave
as
he
do
 
fall
in
love
with
a
girl
who
really
have
nothing
more
than
her
beauty
to
recommend
her
,
attribute
imaginary
virtue
to
her
,
and
even
condescend
to
cleave
to
her
after
she
have
fall
in
love
with
another
man
,
wait
for
her
kind
look
as
a
patient
tremble
dog
wait
for
his
master
's
eye
to
be
turn
upon
him
.
<EOS>
but
in
so
complex
a
thing
as
human
nature
,
we
must
consider
,
it
be
hard
to
find
rule
without
exception
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
I
know
that
,
as
a
rule
,
sensible
man
fall
in
love
with
the
most
sensible
woman
of
their
acquaintance
,
see
through
all
the
pretty
deceit
of
coquettish
beauty
,
never
imagine
themselves
love
when
they
be
not
love
,
cease
love
on
all
proper
occasion
,
and
marry
the
woman
most
fit
for
them
in
every
respect
 
indeed
,
so
as
to
compel
the
approbation
of
all
the
maiden
lady
in
their
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
but
even
to
this
rule
an
exception
will
occur
now
and
then
in
the
lapse
of
century
,
and
my
friend
Adam
be
one
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
however
,
I
respect
him
none
the
less
 
nay
,
I
think
the
deep
love
he
have
for
that
sweet
,
round
,
blossom
-
like
,
dark
-
eyed
Hetty
,
of
whose
inward
self
he
be
really
very
ignorant
,
come
out
of
the
very
strength
of
his
nature
and
not
out
of
any
inconsistent
weakness
.
<EOS>
be
it
any
weakness
,
pray
,
to
be
work
on
by
exquisite
music
?
<EOS>
to
feel
its
wondrous
harmony
search
the
subtle
winding
of
your
soul
,
the
delicate
fibre
of
life
where
no
memory
can
penetrate
,
and
bind
together
your
whole
be
past
and
present
in
one
unspeakable
vibration
,
melt
you
in
one
moment
with
all
the
tenderness
,
all
the
love
that
have
be
scatter
through
the
toilsome
year
,
concentrate
in
one
emotion
of
heroic
courage
or
resignation
all
the
hard
-
learn
lesson
of
self
-
renounce
sympathy
,
blend
your
present
joy
with
past
sorrow
and
your
present
sorrow
with
all
your
past
joy
?
<EOS>
if
not
,
then
neither
be
it
a
weakness
to
be
so
work
upon
by
the
exquisite
curve
of
a
woman
's
cheek
and
neck
and
arm
,
by
the
liquid
depth
of
her
beseech
eye
,
or
the
sweet
childish
pout
of
her
lip
.
<EOS>
for
the
beauty
of
a
lovely
woman
be
like
music
:
what
can
one
say
more
?
<EOS>
Beauty
have
an
expression
beyond
and
far
above
the
one
woman
's
soul
that
it
clothe
,
as
the
word
of
genius
have
a
wide
meaning
than
the
thought
that
prompt
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
more
than
a
woman
's
love
that
move
us
in
a
woman
's
eye
 
<EOS>
it
seem
to
be
a
far
-
off
mighty
love
that
have
come
near
to
us
,
and
make
speech
for
itself
there
;
the
rounded
neck
,
the
dimpled
arm
,
move
us
by
something
more
than
their
prettiness
 
by
their
close
kinship
with
all
we
have
know
of
tenderness
and
peace
.
<EOS>
the
noble
nature
see
the
most
of
this
impersonal
expression
in
beauty
(
it
be
needless
to
say
that
there
be
gentleman
with
whisker
dye
and
undye
who
see
none
of
it
whatever
)
,
and
for
this
reason
,
the
noble
nature
be
often
the
most
blinded
to
the
character
of
the
one
woman
's
soul
that
the
beauty
clothe
.
<EOS>
whence
,
I
fear
,
the
tragedy
of
human
life
be
likely
to
continue
for
a
long
time
to
come
,
in
spite
of
mental
philosopher
who
be
ready
with
the
good
receipt
for
avoid
all
mistake
of
the
kind
.
  
<EOS>
Our
good
Adam
have
no
fine
word
into
which
he
could
put
his
feeling
for
Hetty
:
he
could
not
disguise
mystery
in
this
way
with
the
appearance
of
knowledge
;
he
call
his
love
frankly
a
mystery
,
as
you
have
hear
him
.
<EOS>
He
only
know
that
the
sight
and
memory
of
her
move
him
deeply
,
touch
the
spring
of
all
love
and
tenderness
,
all
faith
and
courage
within
him
.
<EOS>
how
could
he
imagine
narrowness
,
selfishness
,
hardness
in
her
?
<EOS>
He
create
the
mind
he
believe
in
out
of
his
own
,
which
be
large
,
unselfish
,
tender
.
  
<EOS>
the
hope
he
feel
about
Hetty
soften
a
little
his
feeling
towards
Arthur
.
<EOS>
surely
his
attention
to
Hetty
must
have
be
of
a
slight
kind
;
they
be
altogether
wrong
,
and
such
as
no
man
in
Arthur
's
position
ought
to
have
allow
himself
,
but
they
must
have
have
an
air
of
playfulness
about
them
,
which
have
probably
blind
him
to
their
danger
and
have
prevent
them
from
lay
any
strong
hold
on
Hetty
's
heart
.
<EOS>
as
the
new
promise
of
happiness
rise
for
Adam
,
his
indignation
and
jealousy
begin
to
die
out
.
<EOS>
Hetty
be
not
make
unhappy
;
he
almost
believe
that
she
like
him
best
;
and
the
thought
sometimes
cross
his
mind
that
the
friendship
which
have
once
seem
dead
for
ever
may
revive
in
the
day
to
come
,
and
he
would
not
have
to
say
"
good
-
bye
"
to
the
grand
old
wood
,
but
would
like
them
better
because
they
be
Arthur
's
.
<EOS>
for
this
new
promise
of
happiness
follow
so
quickly
on
the
shock
of
pain
have
an
intoxicate
effect
on
the
sober
Adam
,
who
have
all
his
life
be
use
to
much
hardship
and
moderate
hope
.
<EOS>
be
he
really
go
to
have
an
easy
lot
after
all
?
<EOS>
It
seem
so
,
for
at
the
beginning
of
November
,
Jonathan
Burge
,
find
it
impossible
to
replace
Adam
,
have
at
last
make
up
his
mind
to
offer
him
a
share
in
the
business
,
without
further
condition
than
that
he
should
continue
to
give
his
energy
to
it
and
renounce
all
think
of
have
a
separate
business
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
Son
-
in
-
law
or
no
son
-
in
-
law
,
Adam
have
make
himself
too
necessary
to
be
part
with
,
and
his
headwork
be
so
much
more
important
to
Burge
than
his
skill
in
handicraft
that
his
have
the
management
of
the
wood
make
little
difference
in
the
value
of
his
service
;
and
as
to
the
bargain
about
the
squire
's
timber
,
it
would
be
easy
to
call
in
a
third
person
.
<EOS>
Adam
see
here
an
opening
into
a
broaden
path
of
prosperous
work
such
as
he
have
think
of
with
ambitious
longing
ever
since
he
be
a
lad
:
he
may
come
to
build
a
bridge
,
or
a
town
hall
,
or
a
factory
,
for
he
have
always
say
to
himself
that
Jonathan
Burge
's
building
business
be
like
an
acorn
,
which
may
be
the
mother
of
a
great
tree
.
<EOS>
so
he
give
his
hand
to
Burge
on
that
bargain
,
and
go
home
with
his
mind
full
of
happy
vision
,
in
which
(
my
refined
reader
will
perhaps
be
shock
when
I
say
it
)
<EOS>
the
image
of
Hetty
hover
,
and
smile
over
plan
for
seasoning
timber
at
a
trifle
expense
,
calculation
as
to
the
cheapening
of
brick
per
thousand
by
water
-
carriage
,
and
a
favourite
scheme
for
the
strengthening
of
roof
and
wall
with
a
peculiar
form
of
iron
girder
.
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
Adam
's
enthusiasm
lie
in
these
thing
;
and
our
love
be
inwrought
in
our
enthusiasm
as
electricity
be
inwrought
in
the
air
,
exalt
its
power
by
a
subtle
presence
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
would
be
able
to
take
a
separate
house
now
,
and
provide
for
his
mother
in
the
old
one
;
his
prospect
would
justify
his
marry
very
soon
,
and
if
Dinah
consent
to
have
Seth
,
their
mother
would
perhaps
be
more
contented
to
live
apart
from
Adam
.
<EOS>
but
he
tell
himself
that
he
would
not
be
hasty
 
<EOS>
he
would
not
try
Hetty
's
feeling
for
him
until
it
have
have
time
to
grow
strong
and
firm
.
<EOS>
however
,
tomorrow
,
after
church
,
he
would
go
to
the
Hall
Farm
and
tell
them
the
news
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
,
he
know
,
would
like
it
better
than
a
five
-
pound
note
,
and
he
should
see
if
Hetty
's
eye
brighten
at
it
.
<EOS>
the
month
would
be
short
with
all
he
have
to
fill
his
mind
,
and
this
foolish
eagerness
which
have
come
over
him
of
late
must
not
hurry
him
into
any
premature
word
.
<EOS>
yet
when
he
get
home
and
tell
his
mother
the
good
news
,
and
eat
his
supper
,
while
she
sit
by
almost
cry
for
joy
and
want
him
to
eat
twice
as
much
as
usual
because
of
this
good
-
luck
,
he
could
not
help
prepare
her
gently
for
the
come
change
by
talk
of
the
old
house
be
too
small
for
them
all
to
go
on
live
in
it
always
.
    
<EOS>
the
Betrothal
  
<EOS>
it
be
a
dry
Sunday
,
and
really
a
pleasant
day
for
the
2d
of
November
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
sunshine
,
but
the
cloud
be
high
,
and
the
wind
be
so
still
that
the
yellow
leave
which
flutter
down
from
the
hedgerow
elm
must
have
fall
from
pure
decay
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
Mrs.
Poyser
do
not
go
to
church
,
for
she
have
take
a
cold
too
serious
to
be
neglect
;
only
two
winter
ago
she
have
be
lay
up
for
week
with
a
cold
;
and
since
his
wife
do
not
go
to
church
,
Mr.
Poyser
consider
that
on
the
whole
it
would
be
as
well
for
him
to
stay
away
too
and
"
keep
her
company
.
<EOS>
"
He
could
perhaps
have
give
no
precise
form
to
the
reason
that
determine
this
conclusion
,
but
it
be
well
known
to
all
experience
mind
that
our
firm
conviction
be
often
dependent
on
subtle
impression
for
which
word
be
quite
too
coarse
a
medium
.
<EOS>
however
it
be
,
no
one
from
the
Poyser
family
go
to
church
that
afternoon
except
Hetty
and
the
boy
;
yet
Adam
be
bold
enough
to
join
them
after
church
,
and
say
that
he
would
walk
home
with
them
,
though
all
the
way
through
the
village
he
appear
to
be
chiefly
occupy
with
Marty
and
Tommy
,
tell
them
about
the
squirrel
in
Binton
Coppice
,
and
promising
to
take
them
there
some
day
.
<EOS>
but
when
they
come
to
the
field
he
say
to
the
boy
,
"
now
,
then
,
which
be
the
stout
walker
?
<EOS>
Him
as
get
to
th
'
home
-
gate
first
shall
be
the
first
to
go
with
me
to
Binton
Coppice
on
the
donkey
.
<EOS>
but
Tommy
must
have
the
start
up
to
the
next
stile
,
because
he
be
the
small
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
have
never
behave
so
much
like
a
determined
lover
before
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
boy
have
both
set
off
,
he
look
down
at
Hetty
and
say
,
"
will
not
you
hang
on
my
arm
,
Hetty
?
<EOS>
"
in
a
plead
tone
,
as
if
he
have
already
ask
her
and
she
have
refuse
.
<EOS>
Hetty
look
up
at
him
smilingly
and
put
her
round
arm
through
his
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
It
be
nothing
to
her
,
put
her
arm
through
Adam
's
,
but
she
know
he
care
a
great
deal
about
have
her
arm
through
his
,
and
she
wish
him
to
care
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
beat
no
faster
,
and
she
look
at
the
half
-
bare
hedgerow
and
the
ploughed
field
with
the
same
sense
of
oppressive
dulness
as
before
.
<EOS>
but
Adam
scarcely
feel
that
he
be
walk
.
<EOS>
He
think
Hetty
must
know
that
he
be
press
her
arm
a
little
 
a
very
little
.
<EOS>
word
rush
to
his
lip
that
he
dare
not
utter
 
that
he
have
make
up
his
mind
not
to
utter
yet
 
<EOS>
and
so
he
be
silent
for
the
length
of
that
field
.
<EOS>
the
calm
patience
with
which
he
have
once
wait
for
Hetty
's
love
,
content
only
with
her
presence
and
the
thought
of
the
future
,
have
forsake
him
since
that
terrible
shock
nearly
three
month
ago
.
<EOS>
the
agitation
of
jealousy
have
give
a
new
restlessness
to
his
passion
 
have
make
fear
and
uncertainty
too
hard
almost
to
bear
.
<EOS>
but
though
he
may
not
speak
to
Hetty
of
his
love
,
he
would
tell
her
about
his
new
prospect
and
see
if
she
would
be
pleased
.
<EOS>
so
when
he
be
enough
master
of
himself
to
talk
,
he
say
,
"
I
be
go
to
tell
your
uncle
some
news
that
will
surprise
him
,
Hetty
;
and
I
think
he
will
be
glad
to
hear
it
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
?
"
<EOS>
Hetty
say
indifferently
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
Mr.
Burge
have
offer
me
a
share
in
his
business
,
and
I
be
go
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
change
in
Hetty
's
face
,
certainly
not
produce
by
any
agreeable
impression
from
this
news
.
<EOS>
in
fact
she
feel
a
momentary
annoyance
and
alarm
,
for
she
have
so
often
hear
it
hint
by
her
uncle
that
Adam
may
have
Mary
Burge
and
a
share
in
the
business
any
day
,
if
he
like
,
that
she
associate
the
two
object
now
,
and
the
thought
immediately
occur
that
perhaps
Adam
have
give
her
up
because
of
what
have
happen
lately
,
and
have
turn
towards
Mary
Burge
.
<EOS>
with
that
thought
,
and
before
she
have
time
to
remember
any
reason
why
it
could
not
be
true
,
come
a
new
sense
of
forsakenness
and
disappointment
.
<EOS>
the
one
thing
 
the
one
person
 
<EOS>
her
mind
have
rest
on
in
its
dull
weariness
,
have
slip
away
from
her
,
and
peevish
misery
fill
her
eye
with
tear
.
<EOS>
She
be
look
on
the
ground
,
but
Adam
see
her
face
,
see
the
tear
,
and
before
he
have
finish
say
,
"
Hetty
,
dear
Hetty
,
what
be
you
cry
for
?
"
<EOS>
his
eager
rapid
thought
have
fly
through
all
the
cause
conceivable
to
him
,
and
have
at
last
alight
on
half
the
true
one
.
<EOS>
Hetty
think
he
be
go
to
marry
Mary
Burge
 
<EOS>
she
do
not
like
him
to
marry
 
<EOS>
perhaps
she
do
not
like
him
to
marry
any
one
but
herself
?
<EOS>
all
caution
be
sweep
away
 
all
reason
for
it
be
go
,
and
Adam
could
feel
nothing
but
tremble
joy
.
<EOS>
He
lean
towards
her
and
take
her
hand
,
as
he
say
:
  
"
I
could
afford
to
be
marry
now
,
Hetty
 
I
could
make
a
wife
comfortable
;
but
I
shall
never
want
to
be
marry
if
you
will
not
have
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
look
up
at
him
and
smile
through
her
tear
,
as
she
have
do
to
Arthur
that
first
evening
in
the
wood
,
when
she
have
think
he
be
not
come
,
and
yet
he
come
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
feebler
relief
,
a
feebler
triumph
she
feel
now
,
but
the
great
dark
eye
and
the
sweet
lip
be
as
beautiful
as
ever
,
perhaps
more
beautiful
<EOS>
,
for
there
be
a
more
luxuriant
womanliness
about
Hetty
of
late
.
<EOS>
Adam
could
hardly
believe
in
the
happiness
of
that
moment
.
<EOS>
His
right
hand
hold
her
left
,
and
he
press
her
arm
close
against
his
heart
as
he
lean
down
towards
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
really
love
me
,
Hetty
?
<EOS>
Will
you
be
my
own
wife
,
to
love
and
take
care
of
as
long
as
I
live
?
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
do
not
speak
,
but
Adam
's
face
be
very
close
to
her
,
and
she
put
up
her
round
cheek
against
his
,
like
a
kitten
.
<EOS>
She
want
to
be
caress
 
<EOS>
she
want
to
feel
as
if
Arthur
be
with
her
again
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
care
for
no
word
after
that
,
and
they
hardly
speak
through
the
rest
of

about

no

that

Mr.

leave
Adam

which
may

enlarge

the
Hidden
Dread
  
<EOS>
it

a
busy
time
for
Adam
 
<EOS>
the

between
the

and
he
could
see
little
of
Hetty
,
except
on
Sundays
.
<EOS>
but
a
happy
time
,
nevertheless
,
for
it
be
take
him
nearer
and
nearer
to
March
,
when
they
be
to
be
married
,
and
all
the
little
preparation

mark
the
progress

<EOS>
two

after

<EOS>
Lisbeth
have
cry
so
piteously
at
the
thought
of
leave
Adam
that
he
have
go
to
Hetty
and
ask
her
if
,
for
the
love
of
him
,
she
would
put
up
with
his
mother
's
way
and
consent
to
live
with

<EOS>
to
his
great
delight
,
Hetty
say
,
"
yes

I
would

Hetty

say

for
when

there

she

in

there

to

the

It
may
be
that

Mrs.

Hetty

Molly

while
that
good

<EOS>
she

so
entirely
into

that
Mr.

often
tell

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
desirable
event
of
Mrs.

come
downstairs
happen
in
the
early
part
of
February

when
some
mild
weather
thaw
the
last
patch

on

<EOS>
on
one
of
these
day
,
soon
after

down

Hetty
go
to
Treddleston
to
buy
some
of
the
wedding
thing
which
be
want
,
and
which
Mrs.

have
scold
her
for
neglect

observe
that
she
suppose
"
it
be
because
they
be
not
for
th

else
she
would

buy

fast
enough

"
  
<EOS>
It
be
about
ten
o'clock
when
Hetty
set
off
,
and
the
slight
hoar
-
frost
that
have
whiten
the
hedge
in
the
early
morning
have
disappear
as
the
sun
mount
the
cloudless
sky
.
<EOS>
Bright
February
day
have
a
strong
charm
of
hope
about
them
than
any
other
day
in
the
year
.
<EOS>
one
like
to
pause
in
the
mild
ray
of
the
sun
,
and
look
over
the
gate
at
the
patient
plough
-
horse
turn
at
the
end
of
the
furrow
,
and
think
that
the
beautiful
year
be
all
before
one
.
<EOS>
the
bird
seem
to
feel
just
the
same
:
their
note
be
as
clear
as
the
clear
air
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
leave
on
the
tree
and
hedgerow
,
but
how
green
all
the
grassy
field
be
!
<EOS>
and
the
dark
purplish
brown
of
the
ploughed
earth
and
of
the
bare
branch
be
beautiful
too
.
<EOS>
what
a
glad
world
this
look
like
,
as
one
drive
or
ride
along
the
valley
and
over
the
hill
!
<EOS>
I
have
often
think
so
when
,
in
foreign
country
,
where
the
field
and
wood
have
look
to
me
like
<EOS>
our
English
Loamshire
 
<EOS>
the
rich
land
till
with
just
as
much
care
,
the
wood
roll
down
the
gentle
slope
to
the
green
meadow
 
<EOS>
I
have
come
on
something
by
the
roadside
which
have
remind
me
that
I
be
not
in
Loamshire
:
an
image
of
a
great
agony
 
the
agony
of
the
Cross
.
<EOS>
It
have
stand
perhaps
by
the
cluster
apple
-
blossom
,
or
in
the
broad
sunshine
by
the
cornfield
,
or
at
a
turning
by
the
wood
where
a
clear
brook
be
gurgle
below
;
and
surely
,
if
there
come
a
traveller
to
this
world
who
know
nothing
of
the
story
of
man
's
life
upon
it
,
this
image
of
agony
would
seem
to
him
strangely
out
of
place
in
the
midst
of
this
joyous
nature
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
know
that
hide
behind
the
apple
-
blossom
,
or
among
the
golden
corn
,
or
under
the
shroud
bough
of
the
wood
,
there
may
be
a
human
heart
beat
heavily
with
anguish
 
<EOS>
perhaps
a
young
blooming
girl
,
not
know
where
to
turn
for
refuge
from
swift
-
advance
shame
,
understand
no
more
of
this
life
of
our
than
a
foolish
lose
lamb
wander
farther
and
farther
in
the
nightfall
on
the
lonely
heath
,
yet
taste
the
bitter
of
life
's
bitterness
.
  
<EOS>
such
thing
be
sometimes
hide
among
the
sunny
field
and
behind
the
blossom
orchard
;
and
the
sound
of
the
gurgling
brook
,
if
you
come
close
to
one
spot
behind
a
small
bush
,
would
be
mingle
for
your
ear
with
a
despairing
human
sob
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
man
's
religion
have
much
sorrow
in
it
:
no
wonder
he
need
a
suffer
God

<EOS>
Hetty
,
in
her
red
cloak
and
warm
bonnet
,
with
her
basket
in
her
hand
,
be
turn
towards
a
gate
by
the
side
of
the
Treddleston
road
,
but
not
that
she
may
have
a
more
linger
enjoyment
of
the
sunshine
and
think
with
hope
of
the
long
unfolding
year
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
know
that
the
sun
be
shine
;
and
for
week
,
now
,
when
she
have
hope
at
all
,
it
have
be
for
something
at
which
she
herself
tremble
and
shudder
.
<EOS>
She
only
want
to
be
out
of
the
high
-
road
,
that
she
may
walk
slowly
and
not
care
how
her
face
look
,
as
she
dwell
on
wretched
thought
;
and
through
this
gate
she
can
get
into
a
field
-
path
behind
the
wide
thick
hedgerow
.
<EOS>
Her
great
dark
eye
wander
blankly
over
the
field
like
the
eye
of
one
who
be
desolate
,
homeless
,
unloved
,
not
the
promised
bride
of
a
brave
tender
man
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
tear
in
them
<EOS>
:
her
tear
be
all
weep
away
in
the
weary
night
,
before
she
go
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
at
the
next
stile
the
pathway
branch
off
:
there
be
two
road
before
her
 
one
along
by
the
hedgerow
,
which
will
by
and
by
lead
her
into
the
road
again
,
the
other
across
the
field
,
which
will
take
her
much
farther
out
of
the
way
into
the
Scantlands
,
low
shrouded
pasture
where
she
will
see
nobody
.
<EOS>
She
choose
this
and
begin
to
walk
a
little
faster
,
as
if
she
have
suddenly
think
of
an
object
towards
which
it
be
worth
while
to
hasten
.
<EOS>
soon
she
be
in
the
Scantlands
,
where
the
grassy
land
slope
gradually
downward
,
and
she
leave
the
level
ground
to
follow
the
slope
.
<EOS>
farther
on
there
be
a
clump
of
tree
on
the
low
ground
,
and
she
be
make
her
way
towards
it
.
<EOS>
no
,
it
be
not
a
clump
of
tree
,
but
a
dark
shrouded
pool
,
so
full
with
the
wintry
rain
that
the
under
bough
of
the
elder
-
bush
lie
low
beneath
the
water
.
<EOS>
She
sit
down
on
the
grassy
bank
,
against
the
stooping
stem
of
the
great
oak
that
hang
over
the
dark
pool
.
<EOS>
She
have
think
of
this
pool
often
in
the
night
of
the
month
that
have
just
go
by
,
and
now
at
last
she
be
come
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
She
clasp
her
hand
round
her
knee
,
and
lean
forward
,
and
look
earnestly
at
it
,
as
if
try
to
guess
what
sort
of
bed
it
would
make
for
her
young
round
limb
.
  
<EOS>
no
,
she
have
not
courage
to
jump
into
that
cold
watery
bed
,
and
if
she
have
,
they
may
find
her
 
they
may
find
out
why
she
have
drown
herself
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
one
thing
leave
to
her
:
she
must
go
away
,
go
where
they
can
not
find
her
.
  
<EOS>
after
the
first
on
-
coming
of
her
great
dread
,
some
week
after
her
betrothal
to
Adam
,
she
have
wait
and
wait
,
in
the
blind
vague
<EOS>
hope
that
something
would
happen
to
set
her
free
from
her
terror
;
but
she
could
wait
no
longer
.
<EOS>
all
the
force
of
her
nature
have
be
concentrate
on
the
one
effort
of
concealment
,
and
she
have
shrink
with
irresistible
dread
from
every
course
that
could
tend
towards
a
betrayal
of
her
miserable
secret
.
<EOS>
whenever
the
thought
of
write
to
Arthur
have
occur
to
her
,
she
have
reject
it
.
<EOS>
He
could
do
nothing
for
her
that
would
shelter
her
from
discovery
and
scorn
among
the
relative
and
neighbour
who
once
more
make
all
her
world
,
now
her
airy
dream
have
vanish
.
<EOS>
Her
imagination
no
longer
see
happiness
with
Arthur
,
for
he
could
do
nothing
that
would
satisfy
or
soothe
her
pride
.
<EOS>
no
,
something
else
would
happen
 
something
must
happen
 
to
set
her
free
from
this
dread
.
<EOS>
in
young
,
childish
,
ignorant
soul
there
be
constantly
this
blind
trust
in
some
unshapen
chance
:
it
be
as
hard
to
a
boy
or
girl
to
believe
that
a
great
wretchedness
will
actually
befall
them
as
to
believe
that
they
will
die
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
necessity
be
press
hard
upon
her
 
now
<EOS>
the
time
of
her
marriage
be
close
at
hand
 
<EOS>
she
could
no
longer
rest
in
this
blind
trust
.
<EOS>
She
must
run
away
;
she
must
hide
herself
where
no
familiar
eye
could
detect
her
;
and
then
the
terror
of
wander
out
into
the
world
,
of
which
she
know
nothing
,
make
the
possibility
of
go
to
Arthur
a
thought
which
bring
some
comfort
with
it
.
<EOS>
She
feel
so
helpless
now
,
so
unable
to
fashion
the
future
for
herself
,
that
the
prospect
of
throw
herself
on
him
have
a
relief
in
it
which
be
strong
than
her
pride
.
<EOS>
as
she
sit
by
the
pool
and
shudder
at
the
dark
cold
water
,
the
hope
that
he
would
receive
her
tenderly
 
that
he
would
care
for
her
and
think
for
her
 
be
like
a
sense
of
lull
warmth
,
that
make
her
for
the
moment
indifferent
to
everything
else
;
and
she
begin
now
to
think
of
nothing
but
the
scheme
by
which
she
should
get
away
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
have
a
letter
from
Dinah
lately
,
full
of
kind
word
about
the
come
marriage
,
which
she
have
hear
of
from
Seth
;
and
when
Hetty
have
read
this
letter
aloud
to
her
uncle
,
he
have
say
,
"
I
wish
Dinah
'
ud
come
again
now
,
for
she
would
be
a
comfort
to
your
aunt
when
you
be
go
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
,
my
wench
,
o
'
go
to
see
her
as
soon
as
you
can
be
spare
and
persuade
her
to
come
back
wi
'
you
?
<EOS>
You
may
happen
persuade
her
wi
'
tell
her
as
her
aunt
want
her
,
for
all
she
write
o
'
not
be
able
to
come
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hetty
have
not
like
the
thought
of
go
to
Snowfield
,
and
feel
no
longing
to
see
Dinah
,
so
she
only
say
,
"
It
be
so
far
off
,
Uncle
.
"
<EOS>
but
now
she
think
this
propose
visit
would
serve
as
a
pretext
for
go
away
.
<EOS>
She
would
tell
her
aunt
when
she
get
home
again
that
she
should
like
the
change
of
go
to
Snowfield
for
a
week
or
ten
day
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
when
she
get
to
Stoniton
,
where
nobody
know
her
,
she
would
ask
for
the
coach
that
would
take
her
on
the
way
to
Windsor
.
<EOS>
Arthur
be
at
Windsor
,
and
she
would
go
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Hetty
have
determine
on
this
scheme
,
she
rise
from
the
grassy
bank
of
the
pool
,
take
up
her
basket
,
and
go
on
her
way
to
Treddleston
,
for
she
must
buy
the
wedding
thing
she
have
come
out
for
,
though
she
would
never
want
them
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
careful
not
to
raise
any
suspicion
that
she
be
go
to
run
away
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
be
quite
agreeably
surprised
that
Hetty
wish
to
go
and
see
Dinah
and
try
to
bring
her
back
to
stay
over
the
wedding
.
<EOS>
the
sooner
she
go
the
well
,
since
the
weather
be
pleasant
now
;
and
Adam
,
when
he
come
in
the
evening
,
say
,
if
Hetty
could
set
off
to
-
morrow
,
he
would
make
time
to
go
with
her
to
Treddleston
and
see
her
safe
into
the
Stoniton
coach
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
go
with
you
and
take
care
of
you
,
Hetty
,
"
he
say
,
the
next
morning
,
lean
in
at
the
coach
door
;
"
but
you
will
not
stay
much
beyond
a
week
 
the
time
'
ull
seem
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
look
at
her
fondly
,
and
his
strong
hand
hold
her
in
its
grasp
.
<EOS>
Hetty
feel
a
sense
of
protection
in
his
presence
 
she
be
use
to
it
now
:
if
she
could
have
have
the
past
undone
and
know
no
other
love
than
her
quiet
liking
for
Adam
!
<EOS>
the
tear
rise
as
she
give
him
the
last
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
her
for
love
me
,
"
say
Adam
,
as
he
go
on
his
way
to
work
again
,
with
Gyp
at
his
heel
.
  
<EOS>
but
Hetty
's
tear
be
not
for
Adam
 
not
for
the
anguish
that
would
come
upon
him
when
he
find
she
be
go
from
him
for
ever
.
<EOS>
They
be
for
the
misery
of
her
own
lot
,
which
take
her
away
from
this
brave
tender
man
who
offer
up
his
whole
life
to
her
,
and
throw
her
,
a
poor
helpless
suppliant
,
on
the
man
who
would
think
it
a
misfortune
that
she
be
oblige
to
cling
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
at
three
o'clock
that
day
,
when
Hetty
be
on
the
coach
that
be
to
take
her
,
they
say
,
to
Leicester
 
part
of
the
long
,
long
way
to
Windsor
 
<EOS>
she
feel
dimly
that
she
may
be
travel
all
this
weary
journey
towards
the
beginning
of
new
misery
.
  
<EOS>
yet
Arthur
be
at
Windsor
;
he
would
surely
not
be
angry
with
her
.
<EOS>
if
he
do
not
mind
about
her
as
he
use
to
do
,
he
have
promise
to
be
good
to
her
.
      
<EOS>
the
Journey
of
Hope
  
<EOS>
a
long
,
lonely
journey
,
with
sadness
in
the
heart
;
away
from
the
familiar
to
the
strange
:
that
be
a
hard
and
dreary
thing
even
to
the
rich
,
the
strong
,
the
instruct
;
a
hard
thing
,
even
when
we
be
call
by
duty
,
not
urge
by
dread
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
it
then
to
Hetty
?
<EOS>
with
her
poor
narrow
thought
,
no
longer
melt
into
vague
hope
,
but
press
upon
by
the
chill
of
definite
fear
,
repeat
again
and
again
the
same
small
round
of
memory
 
shape
again
and
again
the
same
childish
,
doubtful
image
of
what
be
to
come
 
see
nothing
in
this
wide
world
but
the
little
history
of
her
own
pleasure
and
pain
;
with
so
little
money
in
her
pocket
,
and
the
way
so
long
and
difficult
.
<EOS>
unless
she
could
afford
always
to
go
in
the
coach
 
<EOS>
and
she
feel
sure
she
could
not
,
for
the
journey
to
Stoniton
be
more
expensive
than
she
have
expect
 
<EOS>
it
be
plain
that
she
must
trust
to
carrier
'
cart
or
slow
waggon
;
and
what
a
time
it
would
be
before
she
could
get
to
the
end
of
her
journey
!
<EOS>
the
burly
old
coachman
from
Oakbourne
,
see
such
a
pretty
young
woman
among
the
outside
passenger
,
have
invite
her
to
come
and
sit
beside
him
;
and
feeling
that
it
become
him
as
a
man
and
a
coachman
to
open
the
dialogue
with
a
joke
,
he
apply
himself
as
soon
as
they
be
off
the
stone
to
the
elaboration
of
one
suitable
in
all
respect
.
<EOS>
after
many
cut
with
his
whip
and
glance
at
Hetty
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
,
he
lift
his
lip
above
the
edge
of
his
wrapper
and
say
,
"
He
be
pretty
nigh
six
foot
,
I
will
be
bind
,
isna
he
,
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
?
"
say
Hetty
,
rather
startled
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
the
sweetheart
as
you
have
leave
behind
,
or
else
him
as
you
be
go
arter
 
<EOS>
which
be
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
feel
her
face
flush
and
then
turn
pale
.
<EOS>
She
think
this
coachman
must
know
something
about
her
.
<EOS>
He
must
know
Adam
,
and
may
tell
him
where
she
be
go
,
for
it
be
difficult
to
country
people
to
believe
that
those
who
make
a
figure
in
their
own
parish
be
not
know
everywhere
else
,
and
it
be
equally
difficult
to
Hetty
to
understand
that
chance
word
could
happen
to
apply
closely
to
her
circumstance
.
<EOS>
She
be
too
frightened
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hegh
,
hegh
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
coachman
,
see
that
his
joke
be
not
so
gratify
as
he
have
expect
,
"
you
munna
take
it
too
ser'ous
;
if
he
be
behave
ill
,
get
another
.
<EOS>
such
a
pretty
lass
as
you
can
get
a
sweetheart
any
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
's
fear
be
allay
by
and
by
,
when
she
find
that
the
coachman
make
no
further
allusion
to
her
personal
concern
;
but
it
still
have
the
effect
of
prevent
her
from
ask
him
what
be
the
place
on
the
road
to
Windsor
.
<EOS>
She
tell
him
she
be
only
go
a
little
way
out
of
Stoniton
,
and
when
she
get
down
at
the
inn
where
the
coach
stop
,
she
hasten
away
with
her
basket
to
another
part
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
form
her
plan
of
go
to
Windsor
,
she
have
not
foresee
any
difficulty
except
that
of
get
away
,
and
after
she
have
overcome
this
by
propose
the
visit
to
Dinah
,
her
thought
fly
to
the
meeting
with
Arthur
and
the
question
how
he
would
behave
to
her
 
not
rest
on
any
probable
incident
of
the
journey
.
<EOS>
She
be
too
entirely
ignorant
of
travel
to
imagine
any
of
its
detail
,
and
with
all
her
store
of
money
 
<EOS>
her
three
guinea
 
in
her
pocket
<EOS>
,
she
think
herself
amply
provide
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
she
find
how
much
it
cost
her
to
get
to
Stoniton
that
she
begin
to
be
alarm
about
the
journey
,
and
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
she
feel
her
ignorance
as
to
the
place
that
must
be
pass
on
her
way
.
<EOS>
oppress
with
this
new
alarm
,
she
walk
along
the
grim
Stoniton
street
,
and
at
last
turn
into
a
shabby
little
inn
,
where
she
hope
to
get
a
cheap
lodging
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
here
she
ask
the
landlord
if
he
could
tell
her
what
place
she
must
go
to
,
to
get
to
Windsor
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
can
not
rightly
say
.
<EOS>
Windsor
must
be
pretty
nigh
London
,
for
it
be
where
the
king
live
,
"
be
the
answer
.
<EOS>
"
anyhow
,
you
would
best
go
t
'
Ashby
next
 
<EOS>
that
be
south'ard
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
as
many
place
from
here
to
London
as
there
be
house
in
Stoniton
,
by
what
I
can
make
out
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
be
no
traveller
myself
.
<EOS>
but
how
come
a
lone
young
woman
like
you
to
be
think
<EOS>
o
'
take
such
a
journey
as
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
to
my
brother
 
<EOS>
he
be
a
soldier
at
Windsor
,
"
say
Hetty
,
frighten
at
the
landlord
's
questioning
look
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
afford
to
go
by
the
coach
;
do
you
think
there
be
a
cart
go
toward
Ashby
in
the
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
there
may
be
cart
if
anybody
know
where
they
start
from
;
but
you
may
run
over
the
town
before
you
find
out
.
<EOS>
You
would
best
set
off
and
walk
,
and
trust
to
summat
overtake
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
every
word
sink
like
lead
on
Hetty
's
spirit
;
she
see
the
journey
stretch
bit
by
bit
before
her
now
.
<EOS>
even
to
get
to
Ashby
seem
a
hard
thing
:
it
may
take
the
day
,
for
what
she
know
,
and
that
be
nothing
to
the
rest
of
the
journey
.
<EOS>
but
it
must
be
do
 
<EOS>
she
must
get
to
Arthur
.
<EOS>
oh
,
how
she
yearn
to
be
again
with
somebody
who
would
care
for
her
!
<EOS>
She
who
have
never
get
up
in
the
morning
without
the
certainty
of
see
familiar
face
,
people
on
whom
she
have
an
acknowledge
claim
;
whose
farth
journey
have
be
to
rosseter
on
the
pillion
with
her
uncle
;
whose
thought
have
always
be
take
holiday
in

of
pleasure

because
all

<EOS>
this

Totty

and
nothing
but
a
tremulous
hope
of
distant
refuge
before
her
.
<EOS>
now
for
the
first
time
,
as
she
lie
down
to
-
night
in
the
strange
hard
bed
,
she
feel
that
her
home
have
be
a
happy
one
,
that
her
uncle
have
be
very
good
to
her
,
that
her
quiet
lot
at
Hayslope
among
the
thing
and
people
she
know
,
with
her
little
pride
in
her
one
good
gown
and
bonnet
,
and
nothing
to
hide
from
any
one
,
be
what
she
would
like
to
wake
up
to
as
a
reality
,
and
find
that
all
the
feverish
life
she
have
know
besides
be
a
short
nightmare
.
<EOS>
She
think
of
all
she
have
leave
behind
with
yearning
regret
for
her
own
sake
.
<EOS>
Her
own
misery
fill
her
heart
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
room
in
it
for
other
people
's
sorrow
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
before
the
cruel
letter
,
Arthur
have
be
so
tender
and
loving
.
<EOS>
the
memory
of
that
have
still
a
charm
for
her
,
though
it
be
no
more
than
a
soothing
draught
that
just
make
pain
bearable
.
<EOS>
for
Hetty
could
conceive
no
other
existence
for
herself
in
future
than
a
hide
one
,
and
a
hide
life
,
even
with
love
,
would
have
have
no
delight
for
her
;
still
less
a
life
mingle
with
shame
.
<EOS>
She
know
no
romance
,
and
have
only
a
feeble
share
in
the
feeling
which
be
the
source
of
romance
,
so
that
well
-
read
lady
may
find
it
difficult
to
understand
her
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
She
be
too
ignorant
of
everything
beyond
the
simple
notion
and
habit
in
which
she
have
be
bring
up
to
have
any
more
definite
idea
of
her
probable
future
than
that
Arthur
would
take
care
of
her
somehow
,
and
shelter
her
from
anger
and
scorn
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
marry
her
and
make
her
a
lady
;
and
apart
from
that
she
could
think
of
nothing
he
could
give
towards
which
she
look
with
longing
and
ambition
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
she
rise
early
,
and
take
only
some
milk
and
bread
for
her
breakfast
,
set
out
to
walk
on
the
road
towards
Ashby
,
under
a
leaden
-
coloured
sky
,
with
a
narrowing
streak
of
yellow
,
like
a
depart
hope
,
on
the
edge
of
the
horizon
.
<EOS>
now
in
her
faintness
of
heart
at
the
length
and
difficulty
of
her
journey
,
she
be
most
of
all
afraid
of
spend
her
money
,
and
become
so
destitute
that
she
would
have
to
ask
people
's
charity
;
for
Hettv
have
the
pride
not
only
of
a
proud
nature
but
of
a
proud
class
 
the
class
that
pay
the
most
poor
-
rate
,
and
most
shudder
at
the
idea
of
profit
by
a
poor
-
rate
.
<EOS>
It
have
not
yet
occur
to
her
that
she
may
get
money
for
her
locket
and
earring
which
she
carry
with
her
,
and
she
apply
all
her
small
arithmetic
and
knowledge
of
price
to
calculate
how
many
meal
and
<EOS>
how
many
ride
be
contain
in
her
two
guinea
,
and
the
odd
shilling
,
which
have
a
melancholy
look
,
as
if
they
be
the
pale
ashe
of
the
other
bright
-
flame
coin
.
  
<EOS>
for
the
first
few
mile
out
of
Stoniton
,
she
walk
on
bravely
,
always
fix
on
some
tree
or
gate
or
project
bush
at
the
most
distant
visible
point
in
the
road
as
a
goal
,
and
feel
a
faint
joy
when
she
have
reach
it
.
<EOS>
but
when
she
come
to
the
fourth
milestone
,
the
first
she
have
happen
to
notice
among
the
long
grass
by
the
roadside
,
and
read
that
she
be
still
only
four
mile
beyond
Stoniton
,
her
courage
sink
.
<EOS>
She
have
come
only
this
little
way
,
and
yet
feel
tired
,
and
almost
hungry
again
in
the
keen
morning
air
;
for
though
Hetty
be
accustom
to
much
movement
and
exertion
indoor
,
she
be
not
use
to
long
walk
which
produce
quite
a
different
sort
of
fatigue
from
that
of
household
activity
.
<EOS>
as
she
be
look
at
the
milestone
she
feel
some
drop
fall
on
her
face
 
<EOS>
it
be
begin
to
rain
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
new
trouble
which
have
not
enter
into
her
sad
thought
before
,
and
quite
weigh
down
by
this
sudden
addition
to
her
burden
,
she
sit
down
on
the
step
of
a
stile
and
begin
to
sob
hysterically
.
<EOS>
the
beginning
of
hardship
be
like
the
first
taste
of
bitter
food
 
<EOS>
it
seem
for
a
moment
unbearable
;
yet
,
if
there
be
nothing
else
to
satisfy
our
hunger
,
we
take
another
bite
and
find
it
possible
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
when
Hetty
recover
from
her
burst
of
weeping
,
she
rally
her
fainting
courage
:
it
be
rain
,
and
she
must
try
to
get
on
to
a
village
where
she
may
find
rest
and
shelter
.
<EOS>
presently
,
as
she
walk
on
wearily
,
she
hear
the
rumbling
of
heavy
wheel
behind
her
;
a
cover
waggon
be
come
,
creep
slowly
along
with
a
slouch
driver
crack
his
whip
beside
the
horse
.
<EOS>
She
wait
for
it
,
think
that
if
the
waggoner
be
not
a
very
sour
-
looking
man
,
she
would
ask
him
to
take
her
up
.
<EOS>
as
the
waggon
approach
her
,
the
driver
have
fall
behind
,
but
there
be
something
in
the
front
of
the
big
vehicle
which
encourage
her
.
<EOS>
at
any
previous
moment
in
her
life
she
would
not
have
notice
it
,
but
now
,
the
new
susceptibility
that
suffering
have
awaken
in
her
cause
this
object
to
impress
her
strongly
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
a
small
white
-
and
-
liver
-
colour
spaniel
which
sit
on
the
front
ledge
of
the
waggon
,
with
large
timid
eye
,
and
an
incessant
tremble
in
the
body
,
such
as
you
may
have
see
in
some
of
these
small
creature
.
<EOS>
Hetty
care
little
for
animal
,
as
you
know
,
but
at
this
moment
she
feel
as
if
the
helpless
timid
creature
have
some
fellowship
with
her
,
and
without
be
quite
aware
of
the
reason
,
she
be
less
doubtful
about
speak
to
the
driver
,
who
now
come
forward
 
a
large
ruddy
man
,
with
a
sack
over
his
shoulder
,
by
way
of
scarf
or
mantle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Could
you
take
me
up
in
your
waggon
,
if

Hetty
.
<EOS>
"

,
and
she
half
-
sleep
away
the
hour
till
the
driver
come
to
ask
her
if
she
want
to
get
down
and
have
"
some
victual
"
;
he

public

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
late
at
night
they
reach
Leicester
,
and
so
this
second
day
of
Hetty
's
journey
be
past
.
<EOS>
She
have
spend
no
money
except
what
she
have
pay
for
her
food
,
but
she
feel
that
this
slow
journeying
would
be
intolerable
for
her
another
day
,
and
in
the
morning
she
find
her
way
to
a
coach
-
office
to
ask
about
the
road
to
Windsor
,
and
see
if
it
would
cost
her
too
much
to
go
part
of
the
distance
by
coach
again
.
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
the
distance
be
too
great
 
<EOS>
the
coach
be
too
dear
 
<EOS>
she
must
give
them
up
;
but
the
elderly
clerk
at
the
office
,
touch
by
her
pretty
anxious
face
,
write
down
for
her
the
name
of
the
chief
place
she
must
pass
through
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
only
comfort
she
get
in
Leicester
,
for
the
man
stare
at
her
as
she
go
along
the
street
,
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
Hetty
wish
no
one
would
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
She
set
out
walk
again
;
but
this
day
she
be
fortunate
,
for
she
be
soon
overtake
by
a
carrier
's
cart
which
carry
her
to
Hinckley
,
and
by
the
help
of
a
return
chaise
,
with
a
drunken
postilion
 
who
frighten
her
by
drive
like
Jehu
the
son
of
Nimshi
,
and
shout
hilarious
remark
at
her
,
twist
himself
backwards
on
his
saddle
 
<EOS>
she
be
before
night
in
the
heart
of
woody
Warwickshire
:
<EOS>
but
still
almost
a
hundred
mile
from
Windsor
,
they
tell
her
.
<EOS>
oh
what
a
large
world
it
be
,
and
what
hard
work
for
her
to
find
her
way
in
it
!
<EOS>
She
go
by
mistake
to
Stratford
-
on
-
Avon
,
find
Stratford
set
down
in
her
list
of
place
,
and
then
she
be
tell
she
have
come
a
long
way
out
of
the
right
road
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
till
the
fifth
day
that
she
get
to
Stony
Stratford
.
<EOS>
that
seem
but
a
slight
journey
as
you
look
at
the
map
,
or
remember
your
own
pleasant
travel
to
and
from
the
meadowy
bank
of
the
Avon
.
<EOS>
but
how
wearily
long
it
be
to
Hetty
!
<EOS>
It
seem
to
her
as
if
this
country
of
flat
field
,
and
hedgerow
,
and
dotted
house
,
and
village
,
and
market
-
town
 
all
so
much
alike
to
her
indifferent
eye
 
must
have
no
end
,
and
she
must
go
on
wander
among
them
for
ever
,
wait
tired
at
toll
-
gate
for
some
cart
to
come
,
and
then
find
the
cart
go
only
a
little
way
 
a
very
little
way
 
to
the
miller
's
a
mile
off
perhaps
;
and
she
hate
go
into
the
public
house
,
where
she
must
go
to
get
food
and
ask
question
,
because
there
be
always
man
lounge
there
,
who
stare
at
her
and
joke
her
rudely
.
<EOS>
Her
body
be
very
weary
too
with
these
day
of
new
fatigue
and
anxiety
;
they
have
make
her
look
more
pale
and
worn
than
all
the
time
of
hidden
dread
she
have
go
through
at
home
.
<EOS>
when
at
last
she
reach
Stony
Stratford
,
her
impatience
and
weariness
have
become
too
strong
for
her
economical
caution
;
she
determine
to
take
the
coach
for
the
rest
of
the
way
,
though
it
should
cost
her
all
her
remain
money
.
<EOS>
She
would
need
nothing
at
Windsor
but
to
find
Arthur
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
pay
the
fare
for
the
last
coach
,
she
have
only
a
shilling
;
and
as
she
get
down
at
the
sign
of
the
Green
Man
in
Windsor
at
twelve
o'clock
in
the
middle
of
the
seventh
day
,
hungry
and
faint
,
the
coachman
come
up
,
and
beg
her
to
"
remember
him
.
"
<EOS>
She
put
her
hand
in
her
pocket
and
take
out
the
shilling
,
but
the
tear
come
with
the
sense
of
exhaustion
and
the
thought
that
she
be
give
away
her
last
mean
of
get
food
,
which
she
really
require
before
she
could
go
in
search
of
Arthur
.
<EOS>
as
she
hold
out
the
shilling
,
she
lift
up
her
dark
tear
-
fill
eye
to
the
coachman
's
face
and
say
,
"
Can
you
give
me
back
sixpence
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
he
say
,
gruffly
,
"
never
mind
 
put
the
shilling
up
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
landlord
of
the
Green
Man
have
stand
near
enough
to
witness
this
scene
,
and
he
be
a
man
whose
abundant
feeding
serve
to
keep
his
good
nature
,
as
well
as
his
person
,
in
high
condition
.
<EOS>
and
that
lovely
tearful
face
of
Hetty
's
would
have
find
out
the
sensitive
fibre
in
most
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
young
woman
,
come
in
,
"
he
say
,
"
and
have
adrop
o
'
something
;
you
be
pretty
well
knock
up
,
I
can
see
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
her
into
the
bar
and
say
to
his
wife
,
"
here
,
missis
,
take
this
young
woman
into
the
parlour
;
she
be
a
little
overcome
"
 
for
Hetty
's
tear
be
fall
fast
.
<EOS>
They
be
merely
hysterical
tear
:
she
think
she
have
no
reason
for
weep
now
,
and
be
vex
that
she
be
too
weak
and
tired
to
help
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
at
Windsor
at
last
,
not
far
from
Arthur
.
  
<EOS>
She
look
with
eager
,
hungry
eye
at
the
bread
and
meat
and
beer
that
the
landlady
bring
her
,
and
for
some
minute
she
forget
everything
else
in
the
delicious
sensation
of
satisfy
hunger
and
recover
from
exhaustion
.
<EOS>
the
landlady
sit
opposite
to
her
as
she
eat
,
and
look
at
her
earnestly
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
:
Hetty
have
throw
off
her
bonnet
,
and
her
curl
have
fall
down
.
<EOS>
Her
face
be
all
the
more
touching
in
its
youth
and
beauty
because
of
its
weary
look
,
and
the
good
woman
's
eye
presently
wander
to
her
figure
,
which
in
her
hurried
dressing
on
her
journey
she
have
take
no
pain
to
conceal
;
moreover
,
the
stranger
's
eye
detect
what
the
familiar
unsuspecting
eye
leave
unnoticed
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
be
not
very
fit
for
travel
,
"
she
say
,
glance
while
she
speak
at
Hetty
's
ringless
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
you
come
far
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Hetty
,
rouse
by
this
question
to
exert

ill
through
the

for
any

address
to
her
 
too
ill
even
to
think
with
any

of
the
evil
that

<EOS>
She
only
feel
that
all
her

be
crush
,
and
that
instead
of
have
find
a
refuge
she
have
only
reach
the
border

a
new
wilderness
where
no
goal
lie
before

<EOS>
the
sensation
of
bodily
sickness
,
in
a
comfortable
bed
,
and
with
the
tendance
of
the
good

natured
landlady

make
a
sort
of
respite
for

such
a

oblige

to
throw
himself
on
the
sand

of
toil
onward
under

scorch
sun

<EOS>
but
when
sleep
and
rest
have
bring
back
the
strength
necessary
for
the
keenness
of
mental
suffering
 
when
she
lie
the
next
morning
look
at
the
grow
light
which
be

cruel
task

return
to

hopeless

she

what

,
to
remember
that
all

go

to
look
at
the
prospect
of
further
wander
among
stranger
with
the
new
clearness
shed
on
it
by
the
experience
of
her
journey
to
Windsor

which
way
could
she
turn
?
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
her
to
enter
into
any

even
if
she
could
obtain
it

<EOS>
there
be
nothing

immediate
beggary

She

of
a

against

Sunday

nearly
dead
with

the

the

"
You
can
perhaps
hardly
understand
the
effect
of
that
word
on
a
mind
like
Hetty
's
,
bring
up
among
people
who
be
somewhat
hard
in
their
feeling
even
towards
poverty
,
who
live
among
the
field
,
and
have
little
pity
for
want
and
rag
as
a
cruel
inevitable
fate
such
as
they
sometimes
seem
in
city
,
but
hold
them
a
mark
of
idleness
and
vice
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
idleness
and
vice
that
bring
burden
on
the
parish
.
<EOS>
to
hetty
the
"
parish
"
be
next
to
the
prison
in
obloquy
,
and
to
ask
anything
of
stranger
 
to
beg
 
lie
in
the
same
far
-
off
hideous
region
of
intolerable
shame
that
Hetty
have
all
her
life
think
it
impossible
she
could
ever
come
near
.
<EOS>
but
now
the
remembrance
of
that
wretched
woman
whom
she
have
see
herself
,
on
her
way
from
church
,
be
carry
into
Joshua
Rann
's
,
come
back
upon
her
with
the
new
terrible
sense
that
there
be
very
little
now
to
divide
HER
from
the
same
lot
.
<EOS>
and
the
dread
of
bodily
hardship
mingle
with
the
dread
of
shame
;
for
Hetty
have
the
luxurious
nature
of
a
round
soft
-
coated
pet
animal
.
  
<EOS>
how
she
yearn
to
be
back
in
her
safe
home
again
,
cherish
and
care
for
as
she
have
always
be
!
<EOS>
Her
aunt
be
scold
about
trifle
would
have
be
music
to
her
ear
now
;
she
long
for
it
;
she
use
to
hear
it
in
a
time
when
she
have
only
trifle
to
hide
.
<EOS>
Could
she
be
the
same
Hetty
that
use
to
make
up
the
butter
in
the
dairy
with
the
Guelder
rose
peep
in
at
the
window
 
she
,
a
runaway
whom
her
friend
would
not
open
their
door
to
again
,
lie
in
this
strange
bed
,
with
the
knowledge
that
she
have
no
money
to
pay
for
what
she
receive
,
and
must
offer
those
stranger
some
of
the
clothe
in
her
basket
?
<EOS>
It
be
then
she
think
of
her
locket
and
ear
-
ring
,
and
see
her
pocket
lie
near
,
she
reach
it
and
spread
the
content
on
the
bed
before
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
locket
and
ear
-
ring
in
the
little
velvet
-
line
box
,
and
with
them
there
be
a
beautiful
silver
thimble
which
Adam
have
buy
her
,
<EOS>
the
word
"
remember
me
"
make
the
ornament
of
the
border
;
a
steel
purse
,
with
her
one
shill
in
it
;
and
a
small
red
-
leather
case
,
fasten
with
a
strap
.
<EOS>
those
beautiful
little
ear
-
ring
,
with
their
delicate
pearl
and
garnet
,
that
she
have
try
in
her
ear
with
such
longing
in
the
bright
sunshine
on
the
30th
of
July
!
<EOS>
She
have
no
longing
to
put
them
in
her
ear
now
:
her
head
with
its
dark
ring
of
hair
lie
back
languidly
on
the
pillow
,
and
the
sadness
that
rest
about
her
brow
and
eye
be
something
too
hard
for
regretful
memory
.
<EOS>
yet
she
put
her
hand
up
to
her
ear
:
it
be
because
there
be
some
thin
gold
ring
in
them
,
which
be
also
worth
a
little
money
.
<EOS>
yes
,
she
could
surely
get
some
money
for
her
ornament
:
those
Arthur
have
give
her
must
have
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
.
<EOS>
the
landlord
and
landlady
have
be
good
to
her
;
perhaps
they
would
help
her
to
get
the
money
for
these
thing
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
money
would
not
keep
her
long
.
<EOS>
what
should
she
do
when
it
be
go
?
<EOS>
where
should
she
go
?
<EOS>
the
horrible
thought
of
want
and
beggary
drive
her
once
to
think
she
would
go
back
to
her
uncle
and
aunt
and
ask
them
to
forgive
her
and
have
pity
on
her
.
<EOS>
but
she
shrink
from
that
idea
again
,
as
she
may
have
shrink
from
scorch
metal
.
<EOS>
She
could
never
endure
that
shame
before
her
uncle
and
aunt
,
before
Mary
Burge
,
and
the
servant
at
the
Chase
,
and
the
people
at
Broxton
,
and
everybody
who
know
her
.
<EOS>
They
should
never
know
what
have
happen
to
her
.
<EOS>
what
could
she
do
?
<EOS>
She
would
go
away
from
Windsor
 
<EOS>
travel
again
as
she
have
do
the
last
week
,
and
get
among
the
flat
green
field
with
the
high
hedge
<EOS>
round
them
,
where
nobody
could
see
her
or
know
her
;
and
there
,
perhaps
,
when
there
be
nothing
else
she
could
do
,
she
should
get
courage
to
drown
herself
in
some
pond
like
that
in
the
Scantlands
.
<EOS>
yes
,
she
would
get
away
from
Windsor
as
soon
as
possible
:
she
do
not
like
these
people
at
the
inn
to
know
about
her
,
to
know
that
she
have
come
to
look
for
Captain
Donnithorne
.
<EOS>
She
must
think
of
some
reason
to
tell
them
why
she
have
ask
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
thought
she
begin
to
put
the
thing
back
into
her
pocket
,
mean
to
get
up
and
dress
before
the
landlady
come
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
her
hand
on
the
red
-
leather
case
,
when
it
occur
to
her
that
there
may
be
something
in
this
case
which
she
have
forget
 
something
worth
sell
;
for
without
know
what
she
should
do
with
her
life
,
she
crave
the
mean
of
live
as
long
as
possible
;
and
when
we
desire
eagerly
to
find
something
,
we
be
apt
to
search
for
it
in
hopeless
place
.
<EOS>
no
,
there
be
nothing
but
common
needle
and
pin
,
and
dry
tulip
-
petal
between
the
paper
leave
where
she
have
write
down
her
little
money
-
account
.
<EOS>
but
on
one
of
these
leave
there
be
a
name
,
which
,
often
as
she
have
see
it
before
,
now
flash
on
Hetty
's
mind
like
a
newly
discover
message
.
<EOS>
the
name
be
 
Dinah
Morris
,
Snowfield
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
text
above
it
,
write
,
as
well
as
the
name
,
by
Dinah
's
own
hand
with
a
little
pencil
,
one
evening
that
they
be
sit
together
and
Hetty
happen
to
have
the
red
case
lie
open
before
her
.
<EOS>
Hetty
do
not
read
the
text
now
:
she
be
only
arrest
by
the
name
.
<EOS>
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
she
remember
without
indifference
the
affectionate
kindness
Dinah
have
show
her
,
and
those
word
of
Dinah
in
the
bed
-
chamber
 
that
Hetty
must
think
of
her
as
a
friend
in
trouble
.
<EOS>
suppose
she
be
to
go
to
Dinah
,
and
ask
her
to
help
her
?
<EOS>
Dinah
do
not
think
about
thing
as
other
people
do
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
mystery
to
Hetty
,
but
Hetty
know
she
be
always
kind
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
imagine
Dinah
's
face
turn
away
from
her
in
dark
reproof
or
scorn
,
Dinah
's
voice
willingly
speak
ill
of
her
,
or
rejoice
in
her
misery
as
a
punishment
.
<EOS>
Dinah
do
not
seem
to
belong
to
that
world
of
Hetty
's
,
whose
glance
she
dread
like
scorch
fire
.
<EOS>
but
even
to
her
Hetty
shrink
from
beseeching
and
confession
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
prevail
on
herself
to
say
,
"
I
will
go
to
Dinah
"
:
she
only
think
of
that
as
a
possible
alternative
,
if
she
have
not
courage
for
death
.
  
<EOS>
the
good
landlady
be
amazed
when
she
see
Hetty
come
downstairs
soon
after
herself
,
neatly
dress
,
and
look
resolutely
self
-
possess
.
<EOS>
Hetty
tell
her
she
be
quite
well
this
morning
.
<EOS>
She
have
only
be
very
tired
and
overcome
with
her
journey
,
for
she
have
come
a
long
way
to
ask
about
her
brother
,
who
have
run
away
,
and
they
think
he
be
go
for
a
soldier
,
and
Captain
Donnithorne
may
know
,
for
he
have
be
very
kind
to
her
brother
once
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
lame
story
,
and
the
landlady
look
doubtfully
at
Hetty
as
she
tell
it
;
but
there
be
a
resolute
air
of
self
-
reliance
about
her
this
morning
,
so
different
from
the
helpless
prostration
of
yesterday
,
that
the
landlady
hardly
know
how
to
make
a
remark
that
may
seem
like
pry
into
other
people
's
affair
.
<EOS>
She
only
invite
her
to
sit
down
to
breakfast
with
them
,
and
in
the
course
of
it
Hetty
bring
out
her
ear
-
ring
and
locket
,
and
ask
the
landlord
if
he
could
help
her
to
get
money
for
them
.
<EOS>
Her
journey
,
she
say
,
have
cost
her
much
more
than
she
expect
,
and
now
she
have
no
money
to
get
back
to
her
friend
,
which
she
want
to
do
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
first
time
the
landlady
have
see
the
ornament
,
for
she
have
examine
the
content
of
Hetty
's
pocket
yesterday
,
and
she
and
her
husband
have
discuss
the
fact
of
a
country
girl
have
these
beautiful
thing
,
with
a
strong
conviction
than
ever
that
Hetty
have
be
miserably
delude
by
the
fine
young
officer
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
the
landlord
,
when
Hetty
have
spread
the
precious
trifle
before
him
,
"
we
may
take
'em
to
the
jeweller
's
shop
,
for
there
be
one
not
far
off
;
but
Lord
bless
you
,
they
would
not
give
you
a
quarter
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
what
the
thing
be
worth
.
<EOS>
and
you
would
not
like
to
part
with
'
em
?
"
<EOS>
he
add
,
look
at
her
inquiringly
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
do
not
mind
,
"
say
Hetty
,
hastily
,
"
so
as
I
can
get
money
to
go
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
they
may
think
the
thing
be
steal
,
as
you
want
to
sell
'
em
,
"
he
go
on
,
"
for
it
be
not
usual
for
a
young
woman
like
you
to
have
fine
jew'llery
like
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
blood
rush
to
Hetty
's
face
with
anger
.
<EOS>
"
I
belong
to
respectable
folk
,
"
she
say
;
"
I
be
not
a
thief
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
that
you
be
not
,
I
will
be
bind
,
"
say
the
landlady
;
"
and
you
would
no
call
to
say
that
,
"
look
indignantly
at
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
the
thing
be
gev
to
her
:
that
be
plain
enough
to
be
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
as
I
think
so
,
"
say
the
husband
,
apologetically
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
say
it
be
what
the
jeweller
may
think
,
and
so
he
would
not
be
offer
much
money
for
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
the
wife
,
"
suppose
you
be
to
advance
some
money
on
the
thing
yourself
,
and
then
if
she
like
to
redeem
'em
when
she
get
home
,
she
could
.
<EOS>
but
if
we
hear
nothing
from
her
after
two
month
,
we
may
do
as
we
like
with
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
that
in
this
accommodate
proposition
the
landlady
have
no
regard
whatever
to
the
possible
reward
of
her
good
nature
in
the
ultimate
possession
of
the
locket
and
ear
-
ring
:
indeed
,
the
effect
they
would
have
in
that
case
on
the
mind
of
the
grocer
's
wife
have
present
itself
with
remarkable
vividness
to
her
rapid
imagination
.
<EOS>
the
landlord
take
up
the
ornament
and
push
out
his
lip
in
a
meditative
manner
.
<EOS>
He
wish
Hetty
well
,
doubtless
;
but
pray
,
how
many
of
your
well
-
wisher
would
decline
to
make
a
little
gain
out
of
you
?
<EOS>
Your
landlady
be
sincerely
affected
at
part
with
you
,
respect
you
highly
,
and
will
really
rejoice
if
any
one
else
be
generous
to
you
;
but
at
the
same
time
she
hand
you
a
bill
by
which
she
gain
as
high
a
percentage
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
much
money
do
you
want
to
get
home
with
,
young
woman
?
"
say
the
well
-
wisher
,
at
length
.
  
<EOS>
"
three
guinea
,
"
answer
Hetty
,
fix
on
the
sum
she
set
out
with
,
for
want
of
any
other
standard
,
and
afraid
of
ask
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
have
no
objection
to
advance
you
three
guinea
,
"
say
the
landlord
;
"
and
if
you
like
to
send
it
me
back
and
get
the
jewellery
again
,
you
can
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
the
Green
Man
be
not
go
to
run
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
,
I
will
be
very
glad
if
you
will
give
me
that
,
"
say
Hetty
,
relieve
at
the
thought
that
she
would
not
have
to
go
to
the
jeweller
's
and
be
stare
at
and
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
if
you
want
the
thing
again
,
you
will
write
before
long
,
"
say
the
landlady
,
"
because
when
two
month
be
up
,
we
shall
make
up
our
mind
as
you
do
not
want
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Hetty
indifferently
.
  
<EOS>
the
husband
and
wife
be
equally
content
with
this
arrangement
.
<EOS>
the
husband
think
,
if
the
ornament
be
not
redeem
,
he
could
make
a
good
thing
of
it
by
take
them
to
London
and
sell
them
.
<EOS>
the
wife
think
she
would
coax
the
good
man
into
let
her
keep
them
.
<EOS>
and
they
be
accommodate
Hetty
,
poor
thing
 
<EOS>
a
pretty
,
respectable
-
look
young
woman
,
apparently
in
a
sad
case
.
<EOS>
They
decline
to
take
anything
for
her
food
and
bed
:
she
be
quite
welcome
.
<EOS>
and
at
eleven
o'clock
Hetty
say
"
good
-
bye
"
to
them
with
the
same
quiet
,
resolute
air
she
have
wear
all
the
morning
,
mount
the
coach
that
be
to
take
her
twenty
mile
back
along
the
way
she
have
come
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
strength
of
self
-
possession
which
be
the
sign
that
the
last
hope
have
depart
.
<EOS>
despair
no
more
lean
on
other
than
perfect
contentment
,
and
in
despair
pride
cease
to
be
counteract
by
the
sense
of
dependence
.
  
<EOS>
Hetty
feel
that
no
one
could
deliver
her
from
the
evil
that
would
make
life
hateful
to
her
;
and
no
one
,
she
say
to
herself
,
should
ever
know
her
misery
and
humiliation
.
<EOS>
no
;
she
would
not
confess
even
to
Dinah
.
<EOS>
She
would
wander
out
of
sight
,
and
drown
herself
where
her
body
would
never
be
find
,
and
no
one
should
know
what
have
become
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
get
off
this
coach
,
she
begin
to
walk
again
,
and
take
cheap
ride
in
cart
,
and
get
cheap
meal
,
go
on
and
on
without
distinct
purpose
,
yet
strangely
,
by
some
fascination
,
take
the
way
she
have
come
,
though
she
be
determine
not
to
go
back
to
her
own
country
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
because
she
have
fix
her
mind
on
the
grassy
Warwickshire
field
,
with
the
bushy
tree
-
stud
hedgerow
that
make
a
hiding
-
place
even
in
this
leafless
season
.
<EOS>
She
go
more
slowly
than
she
come
,
often
get
over
the
stile
and
sit
for
hour
under
the
hedgerow
,
look
before
her
with
blank
,
beautiful
eye
;
fancy
herself
at
the
edge
of
a
hide
pool
,
low
down
,
like
that
in
the
Scantlands
;
wonder
if
it
be
very
painful
to
be
drown
,
and
if
there
would
be
anything
bad
after
death
than
what
she
dread
in
life
.
<EOS>
religious
doctrine
have
take
no
hold
on
Hetty
's
mind
.
<EOS>
She
be
one
of
those
numerous
people
who
have
have
godfather
and
godmother
,
learn
their
catechism
,
be
confirm
,
and
go
to
church
every
Sunday
,
and
yet
,
for
any
practical
result
of
strength
in
life
,
or
trust
in
death
,
have
never
appropriate
a
single
christian
idea
or
christian
feeling
.
<EOS>
You
would
misunderstand
her
thought
during
these
wretched
day
,
if
you
imagine
that
they
be
influence
either
by
religious
fear
or
religious
hope
.
  
<EOS>
She
choose
to
go
to
Stratford
-
on
-
Avon
again
,
where
she
have
go
before
by
mistake
,
for
she
remember
some
grassy
field
on
her
former
way
towards
it
 
field
among
which
she
think
she
may
find
just
the
sort
of
pool
she
have
in
her
mind
.
<EOS>
yet
she
take
care
of
her
money
still
;
she
carry
her
basket
;
death
seem
still
a
long
way
off
,
and
life
be
so
strong
in
her
.
<EOS>
She
crave
food
and
rest
 
<EOS>
she
hasten
towards
them
at
the
very
moment
she
be
picture
to
herself
the
bank
from
which
she
would
leap
towards
death
.
<EOS>
It
be
already
five
day
since
she
have
leave
Windsor
,
for
she
have
wander
about
,
always
avoid
speech
or
question
look
,
and
recover
her
air
of
proud
self
-
dependence
whenever
she
be
under
observation
,
choose
her
decent
lodging
at
night
,
and
dress
herself
neatly
in
the
morning
,
and
set
off
on
her
way
steadily
,
or
remain
under
shelter
if
it
rain
,
as
if
she
have
a
happy
life
to
cherish
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
,
even
in
her
most
self
-
conscious
moment
,
the
face
be
sadly
different
from
that
which
have
smile
at
itself
in
the
old
specked
glass
,
or
smile
at
other
when
they
glance
at
it
admiringly
.
<EOS>
a
hard
and
even
fierce
look
have
come
in
the
eye
,
though
their
lash
be
as
long
as
ever
,
and
they
have
all
their
dark
brightness
.
<EOS>
and
the
cheek
be
never
dimple
with
smile
now
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
same
rounded
,
pouting
,
childish
prettiness
,
but
with
all
love
and
belief
in
love
depart
from
it
 
the
sadder
for
its
beauty
,
like
that
wondrous
Medusa
-
face
,
with
the
passionate
,
passionless
lip
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
she
be
among
the
field
she
have
be
dream
of
,
on
a
long
narrow
pathway
lead
towards
a
wood
.
<EOS>
if
there
should
be
a
pool
in
that
wood
!
<EOS>
It
would
be
better
hide
than
one
in
the
field
.
<EOS>
no
,
it
be
not
a
wood
,
only
a
wild
brake
,
where
there
have
once
be
gravel
-
pit
,
leave
mound
and
hollow
stud
with
brushwood
and
small
tree
.
<EOS>
She
roam
up
and
down
,
think
there
be
perhaps
a
pool
in
every
hollow
before
she
come
to
it
,
till
her
limb
be
weary
,
and
she
sit
down
to
rest
.
<EOS>
the
afternoon
be
far
advanced
,
and
the
leaden
sky
be
darken
,
as
if
the
sun
be
set
behind
it
.
<EOS>
after
a
little
while
Hetty
start
up
again
,
feel
that
darkness
would
soon
come
on
;
and
she
must
put
off
find
the
pool
till
to
-
morrow
,
and
make
her
way
to
some
shelter
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
She
have
quite
lose
her
way
in
the
field
,
and
may
as
well
go
in
one
direction
as
another
,
for
aught
she
know
.
<EOS>
She
walk
through
field
after
field
,
and
no
village
,
no
house
be
in
sight
;
but
there
,
at
the
corner
of
this
pasture
,
there
be
a
break
in
the
hedge
;
the
land
seem
to
dip
down
a
little
,
and
two
tree
lean
towards
each
other
across
the
opening
.
<EOS>
Hetty
's
heart
give
a
great
beat
as
she
think
there
must
be
a
pool
there
.
<EOS>
She
walk
towards
it
heavily
over
the
tufted
grass
,
with
pale
lip
and
a
sense
of
tremble
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
the
thing
be
come
in
spite
of
herself
,
instead
of
be
the
object
of
her
search
.
  
<EOS>
there
it
be
,
black
under
the
darkening
sky
:
<EOS>
no
motion
,
no
sound
near
.
<EOS>
She
set
down
her
basket
,
and
then
sink
down
herself
on
the
grass
,
tremble
.
<EOS>
the
pool
have
its
wintry
depth
now
:
by
the
time
it
get
shallow
,
as
she
remember
the
pool
do
at
Hayslope
,
in
the
summer
,
no
one
could
find
out
that
it
be
her
body
.
<EOS>
but
then
there
be
her
basket
 
<EOS>
she
must
hide
that
too
.
<EOS>
She
must
throw
it
into
the
water
 
<EOS>
make
it
heavy
with
stone
first
,
and
then
throw
it
in
.
<EOS>
She
get
up
to
look
about
for
stone
,
and
soon
bring
five
or
six
,
which
she
lay
down
beside
her
basket
,
and
then
sit
down
again
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
need
to
hurry
 
<EOS>
there
be
all
the
night
to
drown
herself
in
.
<EOS>
She
sit
lean
her
elbow
on
the
basket
.
<EOS>
She
be
weary
,
hungry
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
bun
in
her
basket
 
three
,
which
she
have
supply
herself
with
at
the
place
where
she
eat
her
dinner
.
<EOS>
She
take
them
out
now
and
eat
them
eagerly
,
and
then
sit
still
again
,
look
at
the
pool
.
<EOS>
the
soothed
sensation
that
come
over
her
from
the
satisfaction
of
her
hunger
,
and
this
fix
dreamy
attitude
,
bring
on
drowsiness
,
and
presently
her
head
sink
down
on
her
knee
.
<EOS>
She
be
fast
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
awake
it
be
deep
night
,
and
she
feel
chill
.
<EOS>
She
be
frightened
at
this
darkness
 
frighten
at
the
long
night
before
her
.
<EOS>
if
she
could
but
throw
herself
into
the
water
!
<EOS>
no
,
not
yet
.
<EOS>
She
begin
to
walk
about
that
she
may
get
warm
again
,
as
if
she
would
have
more
resolution
then
.
<EOS>
oh
how
long
the
time
be
in
that
darkness
!
<EOS>
the
bright
hearth
and
the
warmth
and
the
voice
of
home
,
the
secure
uprising
and
lie
down
,
the
familiar
field
,
the
familiar
people
,
the
Sundays
and
holiday
with
their
simple
joy
of
dress
and
feasting
 
all
the
sweet
of
her
young
life
rush
before
her
now
,
and
she
seem
to
be
stretch
her
arm
towards
them
across
a
great
gulf
.
<EOS>
She
set
her
tooth
when
she
think
of
Arthur
.
<EOS>
She
curse
him
,
without
know
what
her
cursing
would
do
.
<EOS>
She
wish
he
too
may
know
desolation
,
and
cold
,
and
a
life
of
shame
that
he
dare
not
end
by
death
.
  
<EOS>
the
horror
of
this
cold
,
and
darkness
,
and
solitude
 
out
of
all
human
reach
 
become
great
every
long
minute
.
<EOS>
It
be
almost
as
if
she
be
dead
already
,
and
know
that
she
be
dead
,
and
long
to
get
back
to
life
again
.
<EOS>
but
no
:
she
be
alive
still
;
she
have
not
take
the
dreadful
leap
.
<EOS>
She
feel
a
strange
contradictory
wretchedness
and
exultation
:
wretchedness
,
that
she
do
not
dare
to
face
death
;
exultation
,
that
she
be
still
in
life
 
that
she
may
yet
know
light
and
warmth
again
.
<EOS>
She
walk
backwards
and
forwards
to
warm
herself
,
begin
to
discern
something
of
the
object
around
her
,
as
her
eye
become
accustomed
to
the
night
 
<EOS>
the
dark
line
of
the
hedge
,
the
rapid
motion
of
some
live
creature
 
perhaps
a
field
-
mouse
 
rush
across
the
grass
.
<EOS>
She
no
longer
feel
as
if
the
darkness
hedge
her
in
.
<EOS>
She
think
she
could
walk
back
across
the
field
,
and
get
over
the
stile
;
and
then
,
in
the
very
next
field
,
she
think
she
remember
there
be
a
hovel
of
furze
near
a
sheepfold
.
<EOS>
if
she
could
get
into
that
hovel
,
she
would
be
warm
.
<EOS>
She
could
pass
the
night
there
,
for
<EOS>
that
be
what
Alick
do
at
Hayslope
in
lambing
-
time
.
<EOS>
the
thought
of
this
hovel
bring
the
energy
of
a
new
hope
.
<EOS>
She
take
up
her
basket
and
walk
across
the
field
,
but
it
be
some
time
before
she
get
in
the
right
direction
for
the
stile
.
<EOS>
the
exercise
and
the
occupation
of
find
the
stile
be
a
stimulus
to
her
,
however
,
and
lighten
the
horror
of
the
darkness
and
solitude
.
<EOS>
there
be
sheep
in
the
next
field
,
and
she
startle
a
group
as
she
set
down
her
basket
and
get
over
the
stile
;
and
the
sound
of
their
movement
comfort
her
,
for
it
assure
her
that
her
impression
be
right
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
field
where
she
have
see
the
hovel
,
for
it
be
the
field
where
the
sheep
be
.
<EOS>
right
on
along
the
path
,
and
she
would
get
to
it
.
<EOS>
She
reach
the
opposite
gate
,
and
feel
her
way
along
its
rail
and
the
rail
of
the
sheep
-
fold
,
till
her
hand
encounter
the
pricking
of
the
gorsy
wall
.
<EOS>
delicious
sensation
!
<EOS>
She
have
find
the
shelter
.
<EOS>
She
grope
her
way
,
touch
the
prickly
gorse
,
to
the
door
,
and
push
it
open
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
ill
-
smell
close
place
,
but
warm
,
and
there
be
straw
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Hetty
sink
down
on
the
straw
with
a
sense
of
escape
.
<EOS>
tear
come
 
<EOS>
she
have
never
shed
tear
before
since
she
leave
Windsor
 
tear
and
sobs
of
hysterical
joy
that
she
have
still
hold
of
life
,
that
she
be
still
on
the
familiar
earth
,
with
the
sheep
near
her
.
<EOS>
the
very
consciousness
of
her
own
limb
be
a
delight
to
her
:
she
turn
up
her
sleeve
,
and
kiss
her
arm
with
the
passionate
love
of
life
.
<EOS>
soon
warmth
and
weariness
lull
her
in
the
midst
of
her
sobs
,
and
she
fall
continually
into
dozing
,
fancy
herself
at
the
brink
of
the
pool
again
 
fancy
that
she
have
jump
into
the
water
,
and
then
awake
with
a
start
,
and
wonder
where
she
be
.
<EOS>
but
at
last
deep
dreamless
sleep
come
;
her
head
,
guard
by
her
bonnet
,
find
a
pillow
against
the
gorsy
wall
,
and
the
poor
soul
,
drive
to
and
fro
between
two
equal
terror
,
find
the
one
relief
that
be
possible
to
it
 
the
relief
of
unconsciousness
.
  
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
that
relief
seem
to
end
the
moment
it
have
begin
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
Hetty
as
if
those
dozen
dream
have
only
pass
into
another
dream
 
that
she
be
in
the
hovel
,
and
her
aunt
be
stand
over
her
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
tremble
under
her
aunt
's
glance
,
and
open
her
eye
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
candle
,
but
there
be
light
in
the
hovel
 
the
light
of
early
morning
through
the
open
door
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
a
face
look
down
on
her
;
but
it
be
an
unknown
face
,
belong
to
an
elderly
man
in
a
smock
-
frock
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
what
do
you
do
here
,
young
woman
?
<EOS>
"
the
man
say
roughly
.
  
<EOS>
Hetty
tremble
still
bad
under
this
real
fear
and
shame
than
she
have
do
in
her
momentary
dream
under
her
aunt
's
glance
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
she
be
like
a
beggar
already
 
find
sleep
in
that
place
.
<EOS>
but
in
spite
of
her
tremble
,
she
be
so
eager
to
account
to
the
man
for
her
presence
here
,
that
she
find
word
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
lose
my
way
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
travel
 
north'ard
,
and
I

into

,
and

the
dark
.
<EOS>
Will
you
tell
me
the
way
to
the
near
village
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
get
up
as
she
be
speak
,
and
put
her
hand
to
her
bonnet
to
adjust
it
,
and
then
lay
hold
of
her
basket
.
  
<EOS>
the
man
look
at
her
with
a
slow
bovine
gaze
,
without
give
her
any
answer
,
for
some
second
.
<EOS>
then
he
turn
away
and
walk
towards
the
door
of
the
hovel
,
but
it
be
not
till
he
get
there
that
he
stand
still
,
and
,
turn
his
shoulder
half
-
round
towards
her
,
say
,
"

<EOS>
but

"
he
add
,
with
a
tone
of
gruff
reproof
.
"
<EOS>
y'ull

into
mischief
,

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

"
say
Hetty
,
"
I
will
not

again
.
<EOS>
I
will
keep
in
the
road
,
if
you
will
be
so
good
as

how
to
get

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why

<EOS>
the
man
say
,
still
more
gruffly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
anybody

a

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
be
frighten
at
this
gruff
old
man
,
and
still
more
at
this
last
suggestion
that
she
look
like
a
wild
woman
.
<EOS>
as
she
follow
him
out
of
the
hovel
she
think
she
would
give
him
a
sixpence
for
tell
her
the
way
,
and
then
he
would
not
suppose
she
be
wild
.
<EOS>
as
he
stop
to
point
out
the
road
to
her
,
she
put
her
hand
in
her
pocket
to
get
the
six
-
pence
ready
,
and
when
he
be
turn
away
,
without
say
good

morning
,
she
hold
it
out
to
him
and
say
,
"
thank
you
;
will
you
please
to
take
something
for
your
trouble
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
look
slowly
at
the
sixpence
,
and
then
say
,
"
I
want
none

your

<EOS>
You

<EOS>

if

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
man
leave
her
without
further
speech
,
and
Hetty
hold
on
her
way
.
<EOS>
another
day
have
rise
,
and
she
must
wander
on
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
use
to
think
of
drown
herself
 
she
could
not
do
it
,
at
least
while
she
have
money
leave
to
buy
food
and
strength
to
journey
on
.
<EOS>
but
the
incident
on
her
wake
this
morning
heighten
her
dread
of
that
time
when
her
money
would
be
all
go
;
she
would
have
to
sell
her
basket
and
clothe
then
,
and
she
would
really
look
like
a
beggar
or
a
wild
woman
,
as
the
man
have
say
.
<EOS>
the
passionate
joy
in
life
she
have
feel
in
the
night
,
after
escape
from
the
brink
of
the
black
cold
death
in
the
pool
,
be
go
now
.
<EOS>
life
now
,
by
the
morning
light
,
with
the
impression
of
that
man
's
hard
wondering
look
at
her
,
be
as
full
of
dread
as
death
 
<EOS>
it
be
bad
;
it
be
a
dread
to
which
she
feel
chain
,
from
which
she
shrink
and
shrink
as
she
do
from
the
black
pool
,
and
yet
could
find
no
refuge
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
take
out
her
money
from
her
purse
,
and
look
at
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
still
two
-
and
-
twenty
shilling
;
it
would
serve
her
for
many
day
more
,
or
it
would
help
her
to
get
on
faster
to
Stonyshire
,
within
reach
of
Dinah
.
<EOS>
the
thought
of
Dinah
urge
itself
more
strongly
now
,
since
the
experience
of
the
night
have
drive
her
shuddering
imagination
away
from
the
pool
.
<EOS>
if
it
have
be
only
go
to
Dinah
 
<EOS>
if
nobody
besides
Dinah
would
ever
know
 
Hetty
could
have
make
up
her
mind
to
go
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
soft
voice
,
the
pity
eye
,
would
have
draw
her
.
<EOS>
but
afterwards
the
other
people
must
know
,
and
she
could
no
more
rush
on
that
shame
than
she
could
rush
on
death
.
  
<EOS>
She
must
wander
on
and
on
,
and
wait
for
a
low
depth
of
despair
to
give
her
courage
.
<EOS>
perhaps
death
would
come
to
her
,
for
she
be
get
less
and
less
able
to
bear
the
day
's
weariness
.
<EOS>
and
yet
 
such
be
the
strange
action
of
our
soul
,
draw
us
by
a
lurk
desire
towards
the
very
end
we
dread
 
Hetty
,
when
she
set
out
again
from
Norton
,
ask
the
straight
road
northward
towards
Stonyshire
,
and
keep
it
all
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
poor
wander
Hetty
,
with
the
rounded
childish
face
and
the
hard
,
unloving
,
despair
soul
look
out
of
it
 
with
the
narrow
heart
and
narrow
thought
,
<EOS>
no
room
in
them
for
any
sorrow
but
her
own
,
and
taste
that
sorrow
with
the
more
intense
bitterness
!
<EOS>
My
heart
bleed
for
her
as
I
see
her
toiling
along
on
her
weary
foot
,
or
seat
in
a
cart
,
with
her
eye
fix
vacantly
on
the
road
before
her
,
never
think
or
care
whither
it
tend
,
till
hunger
come
and
make
her
desire
that
a
village
may
be
near
.
  
<EOS>
what
will
be
the
end
,
the
end
of
her
objectless
wander
,
apart
from
all
love
,
care
for
human
being
only
through
her
pride
,
cling
to
life
only
as
the
hunt
wound
brute
cling
to
it
?
  
<EOS>
God
preserve
you
and
me
from
be
the
beginner
of
such
misery
!
    
<EOS>
the
Quest
  
<EOS>
the
first
ten
day
after
Hetty
's
departure
pass
as
quietly
as
any
other
day
with
the
family
at
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
with
Adam
at
his
daily
work
.
<EOS>
They
have
expect
Hetty
to
stay
away
a
week
or
ten
day
at
least
,
perhaps
a
little
longer
if
Dinah
come
back
with
her
,
because
there
may
then
be
something
to
detain
them
at
Snowfield
.
<EOS>
but
when
a
fortnight
have
pass
they
begin
to
feel
a
little
surprise
that
Hetty
do
not
return
;
she
must
surely
have
find
it
pleasanter
to
be
with
Dinah
than
any
one
could
have
suppose
.
<EOS>
Adam
,
for
his
part
,
be
get
very
impatient
to
see
her
,
and
he
resolve
that
,
if
she
do
not
appear
the
next
day
(
Saturday
)
,
he
would
set
out
on
Sunday
morning
to
fetch
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
coach
on
a
Sunday
,
but
by
set
out
before
it
be
light
,
and
perhaps
get
a
lift
in
a
cart
by
the
way
,
he
would
arrive
pretty
early
at
Snowfield
,
and
bring
back
Hetty
the
next
day
 
Dinah
too
,
if
she
be
come
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
time
Hetty
come
home
,
and
he
would
afford
to
lose
his
Monday
for
the
sake
of
bring
her
.
  
<EOS>
His
project
be
quite
approve
at
the
Farm
when
he
go
there
on
Saturday
evening
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
desire
him
emphatically
not
to
come
back
without
Hetty
,
for
she
have
be
quite
too
long
away
,
consider
the
thing
she
have
to
get
ready
by
the
middle
of
March
,
and
a
week
be
surely
enough
for
any
one
to
go
out
for
their
health
.
<EOS>
as
for
Dinah
,
Mrs.
Poyser
have
small
hope
of
their
bring
her
,
unless
they
could
make
her
believe
the
folk
at
Hayslope
be
twice
as
miserable
as
the
folk
at
Snowfield
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
though
,
"
say
Mrs.
Poyser
,
by
way
of
conclusion
,
"
you
may
tell
her
she
be
get
<EOS>
but
one
aunt
leave
,
and
SHE
be
waste
pretty
nigh
to
a
shadder
;
and
we
shall
p'rhaps
all
be
go
twenty
mile
farther
off
her
next
Michaelmas
,
and
shall
die
o
'
broken
heart
among
strange
folk
,
and
leave
the
child
fatherless
and
motherless
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
nay
,
"
say
Mr.
Poyser
,
who
certainly
have
the
air
of
a
man
perfectly
heart
-
whole
,
"
it
isna
so
bad
as
that
.
<EOS>
thee't
look
rarely
now
,
and
get
flesh
every
day
.
<EOS>
but
I
would
be
glad
for
Dinah
t
'
come
,
for
she
would
help
thee
wi
'
the
little
uns
<EOS>
:
they
take
t
'
her
wonderful
.
"
  
<EOS>
so
at
daybreak
,
on
Sunday
,
Adam
set
off
.
<EOS>
Seth
go
with
him
the
first
mile
or
two
,
for
the
thought
of
Snowfield
and
the
possibility
that
Dinah
may
come
again
make
him
restless
,
and
the
walk
with
Adam
in
the
cold
morning
air
,
both
in
their
good
clothe
,
help
to
give
him
a
sense
of
Sunday
calm
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
last
morning
in
February
,
with
a
low
grey
sky
,
and
a
slight
hoar
-
frost
on
the
green
border
of
the
road
and
on
the
black
hedge
.
<EOS>
They
hear
the
gurgling
of
the
full
brooklet
hurry
down
the
hill
,
and
the
faint
twittering
of
the
early
bird
.
<EOS>
for
they
walk
in
silence
,
though
with
a
pleased
sense
of
companionship
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
-
bye
,
lad
,
"
say
Adam
,
lay
his
hand
on
Seth
's
shoulder
and
look
at
him
affectionately
as
they
be
about
to
part
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
thee
wast
go
<EOS>
all
the
way
wi
'
me
,
and
as
happy
as
I
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
content
,
Addy
,
I
be
content
,
"
say
Seth
cheerfully
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
an
old
bachelor
,
belike
,
and
make
a
fuss
wi
'
thy
child
.
"
  
<EOS>
The'y
turn
away
from
each
other
,
and
Seth
walk
leisurely
homeward
,
mentally
repeat
one
of
his
favourite
hymn
 
<EOS>
he
be
very
fond
of
hymn
:
       
<EOS>
Dark
and
cheerless
be
the
morn
     
Unaccompanied
by
thee
:
     
<EOS>
Joyless
be
the
day
's
return
     
<EOS>
till
thy
mercy
's
beam
<EOS>
I
see
:
     
<EOS>
till
thou
inward
light
impart
,
     
Glad
<EOS>
my
eye
and
warm
my
heart
.
       
<EOS>
Visit
,
then
,
this
soul
of
mine
,
     
Pierce
<EOS>
the
gloom
of
sin
and
grief
       
fill
me
,
Radiancy
Divine
,
     
Scatter
<EOS>
all
my
unbelief
.
     
<EOS>
More
and
more

display
,
     
<EOS>

the
perfect
day

<EOS>
Adam
walk
much
faster
,
and
any
one
come
along
the
Oakbourne
road
at
sunrise
that
morning
must
have
have
a
pleasant
sight
in
this
tall
broad
-
cheste
man
,
stride
along
with
a
carriage
as
upright
and
firm
as
any
soldier
's
,
glance
with
keen
glad
eye
at
the
dark
-
blue
hill
as
they
begin
to
show
themselves
on
his
way
.
<EOS>
seldom
in
Adam
's
life
have
his
face
be
so
free
from
any
cloud
of
anxiety
as
it
be
this
morning
;
and
this
freedom
from
care
,
as
be
usual
with
constructive
practical
mind
like
his
,
make
him
all
the
more
observant
of
the
object
round
him
and
all
the
more
ready
to
gather
suggestion
from
them
towards
his
own
favourite
plan
and
ingenious
contrivance
.
<EOS>
His
happy
love
 
the
knowledge
that
his
step
be
carry
him
nearer
and
near
to
Hetty
,
who
be
so
soon
to
be
his
 
be
to
his
thought
what
the
sweet
morning
air
be
to
his
sensation
:
it
give
him
a
consciousness
of
well
-
being
that
make
activity
delightful
.
<EOS>
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
there
be
a
rush
of
more
intense
feeling
towards
her
,
which
chase
away
other
image
than
Hetty
;
and
along
with
that
<EOS>
would
come
a
wonder
thankfulness
that
all
this
happiness
be
give
to
him
 
that
this
life
of
our
have
such
sweetness
in
it
.
<EOS>
for
Adam
have
a
devout
mind
,
though
he
be
perhaps
rather
impatient
of
devout
word
,
and
his
tenderness
lie
very
close
to
his
reverence
,
so
that
the
one
could
hardly
be
stir
without
the
other
.
<EOS>
but
after
feeling
have
well
up
and
pour
itself
out
in
this
way
,
busy
thought
would
come
back
with
the
great
vigour
;
and
this
morning
it
be
intent
on
scheme
by
which
the
road
may
be
improve
that
be
so
imperfect
all
through
the
country
,
and
on
picture
all
the
benefit
that
may
come
from
the
exertion
of
a
single
country
gentleman
,
if
he
would
set
himself
to
get
the
road
make
good
in
his
own
district
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
a
very
short
walk
,
the
ten
mile
to
Oakbourne
,
that
pretty
town
within
sight
of
the
blue
hill
,
where
he
break
-
fast
.
<EOS>
after
this
,
the
country
grow
barer
and
barer
:
no
more
rolling
wood
,
no
more
wide
-
branching
tree
near
frequent
homestead
,
no
more
bushy
hedgerow
,
but
greystone
wall
intersect
the
meagre
pasture
,
and
dismal
wide
-
scatter
greystone
house
on
broken
land
where
mine
have
be
and
be
no
longer
.
"
<EOS>
a
hungry
land
,
"
say
Adam
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
go
south'ard
,
where
they
say
it
be
as
flat
as
a
table
,
than
come
to
live
here
;
though
if
Dinah
like
to
live
in
a
country
where
she
can
be
the
most
comfort
to
folk
,
she
be
i
'
the
right
to
live
o
'
this
side
;
for
she
must
look
as
if
she
would
come
straight
from
heaven
,
like
th
'
angel
in
the
desert
,
to
strengthen
them
as
ha
'
get
nothing
t
'
eat
.
"
<EOS>
and
when
at
last
he
come
in
sight
of
Snowfield
,
he
think
it
look
like
a
town
that
be
"
fellow
to
the
country
,
"
though
the
stream
through
the
valley
where
the
great
mill
stand
give
a
pleasant
greenness
to
the
low
field
.
<EOS>
the
town
lie
,
grim
,
stony
,
and
unsheltered
,
up
the
side
of
a
steep
hill
,
and
Adam
do
not
go
forward
to
it
at
present
,
for
Seth
have
tell
him
where
to
find
Dinah
.
<EOS>
It
be
at
a
thatched
cottage
outside
the
town
,
a
little
way
from
the
mill
 
<EOS>
an
old
cottage
,
stand
sideways
towards
the
road
,
with
a
little
bit
of
potato
-
ground
before
it
.
<EOS>
here
Dinah
lodge
with
an
elderly
couple
;
and
if
she
and
Hetty
happen
to
be
out
,
Adam
could
learn
where
they
be
go
,
or
when
they
would
be
at
home
again
.
<EOS>
Dinah
may
be
out
on
some
preach
errand
,
and
perhaps
she
would
have
leave
Hetty
at
home
.
<EOS>
Adam
could
not
help
hope
this
,
and
as
he
recognize
the
cottage
by
the
roadside
before
him
,
there
shine
out
in
his
face
that
involuntary
smile
which
belong
to
the
expectation
of
a
near
joy
.
  
<EOS>
He
hurry
his
step
along
the
narrow
causeway
,
and
rap
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
be
open
by
a
very
clean
old
woman
,
with
a
slow
palsied
shake
of
the
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
Dinah
Morris
at
home
?
"
say
Adam
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh?
<EOS>
...
no
,
"
say
the
old
woman
,
look
up
at
this
tall
stranger
with
a
wonder
that
make
her
slow
of
speech
than
usual
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
please
to
come
in
?
"
she
add
,
retire
from
the
door
,
as
if
recollect
herself
.
<EOS>
"
why

"
  
<EOS>
Adam
sit
down
patiently
,
not
like
to
hurry
the
shake
old
woman
with
question
,
but
look
eagerly
towards
the
narrow
twisting
stair
in
one
corner
,
for
he
think
it
be
possible
<EOS>
Hetty
may
have
hear
his
voice
and
would
come
down
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
so

be
come

the

<EOS>
"
  
"
no

Adam
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
think
it
likely
she
may
be
away
,
see
as
it
be
Sunday
.
<EOS>
but
the
other
young
woman
 
be
she
at
home
,
or
go
along
with
Dinah
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
old
woman
look
at
Adam
with
a
bewilder
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
go
along
wi

"
<EOS>
she
say
.
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
You

see
her
room
here
,
"
she
go
on
,
open
a
door
and
not
notice
the
effect
of
her
word
on
Adam
.
<EOS>
He
rise
and
follow
her
,
and
dart
an
eager
glance
into
the
little
room
with
its
narrow
bed
,
the
portrait
of
Wesley
on
the
wall
,
and
the
few
book
lie
on
the
large
Bible
.
<EOS>
He
have
have
an
irrational
hope
that
Hetty
may
be
there
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
speak
in
the
first
moment
after
see
that
the
room
be
empty
;
an
undefined
fear
have
seize
him
 
something
have
happen
to
Hetty
on
the
journey
.
<EOS>
still
the
old
woman
be
so
slow
of
;
speech
and
apprehension
,
that
Hetty
may
be
at
Snowfield
after
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
It

<EOS>
the
old
woman
have
see
the
ghastly
look
of
fear
in
Adam
's
face
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
not
stun
or
confound
:
he
be
think
eagerly
where

could
inquire
about

I

good

"
  
<EOS>
He
hasten
out
of
the
cottage
,
and
the
old
woman
follow
him
to
the
gate
,
watch
him
sadly
with
her
shake
head
as
he
almost
run
towards
the
town
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
inquire
at
the
place
where
the
oakbourne
coach
stop
.
  
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
no
young
woman
like
Hetty
have
be
see
there
.
<EOS>
have
any
accident
happen
to
the
coach
a
fortnight
ago
?
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
no
coach
to
take
him
back
to
Oakbourne
that
day
.
<EOS>
well
,
he
would
walk
:
<EOS>
he
could
not
stay
here
,
in
wretched
inaction
.
<EOS>
but
the
innkeeper
,
see
that
Adam
be
in
great
anxiety
,
and
enter
into
this
new
incident
with
the
eagerness
of
a
man
who
pass
a
great
deal
of
time
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
look
into
an
obstinately
monotonous
street
,
offer
to
take
him
back
to
Oakbourne
in
his
own
"
tax
cart
"
this
very
evening
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
five
o'clock
;
there
be
plenty
of
time
for
Adam
to
take
a
meal
and
yet
to
get
to
Oakbourne
before
ten
o'clock
.
<EOS>
the
innkeeper
declare
that
he
really
want
to
go
to
Oakbourne
,
and
may
as
well
go
to
-
night
;
he
should
have
all
Monday
before
him
then
.
<EOS>
Adam
,
after
make
an
ineffectual
attempt
to
eat
,
put
the
food
in
his
pocket
,
and
,
drink
a
draught
of
ale
,
declare
himself
ready
to
set
off
.
<EOS>
as
they
approach
the
cottage
,
it
occur
to
him
that
he
would
do
well
to
learn
from
the
old
woman
where
Dinah
be
to
be
find
in
Leeds
:
if
there
be
trouble
at
the
Hall
Farm
 
<EOS>
he
only
half
-
admit
the
forebode
that
there
would
be
 
the
Poysers
may
like
to
send
for
Dinah
.
<EOS>
but
Dinah
have
not
leave
any
address
,
and
the
old
woman
,
whose
memory
for
name
be
infirm
,
could
not
recall
the
name
of
the
"
blessed
woman
"
who
be
Dinah
's
chief
friend
in
the
Society
at
Leeds
.
  
<EOS>
during
that
long
,
long
journey
in
the
tax
cart
,
there
be
time
for
all
the
conjecture
of
importunate
fear
and
struggle
hope
.
<EOS>
in
the
very
first
shock
of
discover
that
Hetty
have
not
be
to
Snowfield
,
the
thought
of
Arthur
have
dart
through
Adam
like
a
sharp
pang
,
but
he
try
for
some
time
to
ward
off
its
return
by
busy
himself
with
mode
of
account
for
the
alarming
fact
,
quite
apart
from
that
intolerable
thought
.
<EOS>
some
accident
have
happen
.
<EOS>
Hetty
have
,
by
some
strange
chance
,
get
into
a
wrong
vehicle
from
Oakbourne
:
she
have
be
take
ill
,
and
do
not
want
to
frighten
them
by
let
them
know
.
<EOS>
but
this
frail
fence
of
vague
improbability
be
soon
hurl
down
by
a
rush
of
distinct
agonizing
fear
.
<EOS>
Hetty
have
be
deceive
herself
in
think
that
she
could
love
and
marry
him
:
she
have
be
love
Arthur
all
the
while
;
and
now
,
in
her
desperation
at
the
nearness
of
their
marriage
,
she
have
run
away
.
<EOS>
and
she
be
go
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
old
indignation
and
jealousy
rise
again
,
and
prompt
the
suspicion
that
Arthur
have
be
deal
falsely
 
have
write
to
Hetty
 
have
tempt
her
to
come
to
him
 
be
unwilling
,
after
all
,
that
she
should
belong
to
another
man
besides
himself
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
whole
thing
have
be
contrive
by
him
,
and
he
have
give
her
direction
how
to
follow
him
to
Ireland
 
for
Adam
know
that
Arthur
have
be
go
thith
three
week
ago
,
have
recently
learn
it
at
the
Chase
.
<EOS>
every
sad
look
of
Hetty
's
,
since
she
have
be
engage
to
Adam
,
return
upon
him
now
with
all
the
exaggeration
of
painful
retrospect
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
foolishly
sanguine
and
confident
.
<EOS>
the
poor
thing
have
not
perhaps
know
her
own
mind
for
a
long
while
;
have
think
that
she
could
forget
Arthur
;
have
be
momentarily
draw
towards
the
man
who
offer
her
a
protect
,
faithful
love
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
to
blame
her
:
she
never
mean
to
cause
him
this
dreadful
pain
.
<EOS>
the
blame
lie
with
that
man
who
have
selfishly
play
with
her
heart
 
have
perhaps
even
deliberately
lure
her
away
.
  
<EOS>
at
Oakbourne
,
the
ostler
at
the
Royal
Oak
remember
such
a
young
woman
as
Adam
describe
get
out
of
the
Treddleston
coach
more
than
a
fortnight
ago
 
be
not
likely
to
forget
such
a
pretty
lass
as
that
in
a
hurry
 
be
sure
she
have
not
go
on
by
the
Buxton
coach
that
go
through
Snowfield
,
but
have
lose
sight
of
her
while
he
go
away
with
the
horse
and
have
never
set
eye
on
her
again
.
<EOS>
Adam
then
go
straight
to
the
house
from
which
the
Stonition
coach
start
:
Stoniton
be
the
most
obvious
place
for
Hetty
to
go
to
first
<EOS>
,
whatever
may
be
her
destination
,
for
she
would
hardly
venture
on
any
but
the
chief
coach
-
road
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
notice
here
too
,
and
be
remember
to
have
sit
on
the
box
by
the
coachman
;
but
the
coachman
could
not
be
see
,
for
another
man
have
be
drive
on
that
road
in
his
stead
the
last
three
or
four
day
.
<EOS>
He
could
probably
be
see
at
Stoniton
,
through
inquiry
at
the
inn
where
the
coach
put
up
.
<EOS>
so
the
anxious
heart
-
stricken
Adam
must
of
necessity
wait
and
try
to
rest
till
morning
 
<EOS>
nay
,
till
eleven
o'clock
,
when
the
coach
start
.
  
<EOS>
at
Stoniton
another
delay
occur
,
for
the
old
coachman
who
have
drive
Hetty
would
not
be
in
the
town
again
till
night
.
<EOS>
when
he
do
come
he
remember
Hetty
well
,
and
remember
his
own
joke
address
to
her
,
quote
it
many
time
to
Adam
,
and
observe
with
equal
frequency
that
he
think
there
be
something
more
than
common
,
because
Hetty
have
not
laugh
when
he
joke
her
.
<EOS>
but
he
declare
,
as
the
people
have
do
at
the
inn
,
that
he
have
lose
sight
of
Hetty
directly
she
get
down
.
<EOS>
part
of
the
next
morning
be
consume
in
inquiry
at
every
house
in
the
town
from
which
a
coach
start
 
(
all
in
vain
,
for
you
know
<EOS>
Hetty
do
not
start
from
stonition
by
coach
,
but
on
foot
in
the
grey
morning
)
 
<EOS>
and
then
in
walk
out
to
the
first
toll
-
gate
on
the
different
line
of
road
,
in
the
forlorn
hope
of
find
some
recollection
of
her
there
.
<EOS>
no
,
she
be
not
to
be
trace
any
farther
;
and
the
next
hard
task
for
Adam
be
to
go
home
and
carry
the
wretched
tiding
to
the
Hall
Farm
.
<EOS>
as
to
what
he
should
do
beyond
that
,
he
have
come
to
two
distinct
resolution
amidst
the
tumult
of
thought
and
feeling
which
be
go
on
within
him
while
he
go
to
and
fro
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
mention
what
he
know
of
Arthur
Donnithorne
's
behaviour
to
Hetty
till
there
be
a
clear
necessity
for
it
:
it
be
still
possible
Hetty
may
come
back
,
and
the
disclosure
may
be
an
injury
or
an
offence
to
her
.
<EOS>
and
as
soon
as
he
have
be
home
and
do
what
be
necessary
there
to
prepare
for
his
further
absence
,
he
would
start
off
to
Ireland
:
if
he
find
no
trace
of
Hetty
on
the
road
,
he
would
go
straight
to
Arthur
Donnithorne
and
make
himself
certain
how
far
he
be
acquaint
with
her
movement
.
<EOS>
several
time
the
thought
occur
to
him
that
he
would
consult
Mr.
Irwine
,
but
that
would
be
useless
unless
he
tell
him
all
,
and
so
betray
the
secret
about
Arthur
.
<EOS>
It
seem
strange
that
Adam
,
in
the
incessant
occupation
of
his
mind
about
Hetty
,
should
never
have
alight
on
the
probability
that
she
have
go
to
Windsor
,
ignorant
that
Arthur
be
no
longer
there
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
reason
be
that
he
could
not
conceive
Hetty
's
throw
herself
on
Arthur
uncalle
;
he
imagine
no
cause
that
could
have
drive
her
to
such
a
step
,
after
that
letter
write
in
August
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
two
alternative
in
his
mind
:
<EOS>
either
Arthur
have
write
to
her
again
and
entice
her
away
,
or
she
have
simply
flee
from
her
approach
marriage
with
himself
<EOS>
because
she
find
,
after
all
,
she
could
not
love
him
well
enough
,
and
yet
be
afraid
of
her
friend
'
anger
if
she
retract
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
last
determination
on
his
mind
,
of
go
straight
to
Arthur
,
the
thought
that
he
have
spend
two
day
in
inquiry
which
have
prove
to
be
almost
useless
,
be
torture
to
Adam
;
and
yet
,
since
he
would
not
tell
the
Poysers
his
conviction
as
to
where
Hetty
be
go
,
or
his
intention
to
follow
her
thither
,
he
must
be
able
to
say
to
them
that
he
have
trace
her
as
far
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
after
twelve
o'clock
on
Tuesday
night
when
Adam
reach
Treddleston
;
and
,
unwilling
to
disturb
his
mother
and
Seth
,
and
also
to
encounter
their
question
at
that
hour
,
he
throw
himself
without
undress
on
a
bed
at
the
"
Waggon
Overthrown
,
"
and
sleep
hard
from
pure
weariness
.
<EOS>
not
more
than
four
hour
,
however
,
for
before
five
o'clock
he
set
out
on
his
way
home
in
the
faint
morning
twilight
.
<EOS>
He
always
keep
a
key
of
the
workshop
door
in
his
pocket
,
so
that
he
could
let
himself
in
;
and
he
wish
to
enter
without
awake
his
mother
,
for
he
be
anxious
to
avoid
tell
her
the
new
trouble
himself
by
see
Seth
first
,
and
ask
him
to
tell
her
when
it
should
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
He
walk
gently
along
the
yard
,
and
turn
the
key
gently
in
the
door
;
but
,
as
he
expect
,
Gyp
,
who
lie
in
the
workshop
,
give
a
sharp
bark
.
<EOS>
It
subside
when
he
see
Adam
,
hold
up
his
finger
at
him
to
impose
silence
,
and
in
his
dumb
,
tailless
joy
he
must
content
himself
with
rub
his
body
against
his
master
's
leg
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
be
too
heart
-
sick
to
take
notice
of
Gyp
's
fondling
.
<EOS>
He
throw
himself
on
the
bench
and
stare
dully
at
the
wood
and
the
sign
of
work
around
him
,
wonder
if
he
should
ever
come
to
feel
pleasure
in
them
again
,
while
Gyp
,
dimly
aware
that
there
be
something
wrong
with
his
master
,
lay
his
rough
grey
head
on
Adam
's
knee
and
wrinkle
his
brow
to
look
up
at
him
.
<EOS>
hitherto
,
since
Sunday
afternoon
,
Adam
have
be
constantly
among
strange
people
and
in
strange
place
,
have
no
association
with
the
detail
of
his
daily
life
,
and
now
that
by
the
light
of
this
new
morning
he
be
come
back
to
his
home
and
surround
by
the
familiar
object
that
seem
for
ever
rob
of
their
charm
,
the
reality
 
<EOS>
the
hard
,
inevitable
reality
of
his
trouble
press
upon
him
with
a
new
weight
.
<EOS>
right
before
him
be
an
unfinished
chest
of
drawer
,
which
he
have
be
make
in
spare
moment
for
Hetty
's
use
,
when
his
home
should
be
hers
.
  
<EOS>
Seth
have
not
hear
Adam
's
entrance
,
but
he
have
be
rouse
by
Gyp
's
bark
,
and
Adam
hear
him
move
about
in
the
room
above
,
dress
himself
.
<EOS>
Seth
's
first
thought
be
about
his
brother
:
he
would
come
home
to
-
day
,
surely
,
for
the
business
would
be
want
him
sadly
by
to
-
morrow
,
but
it
be
pleasant
to
think
he
have
have
a
long
holiday
than
he
have
expect
.
<EOS>
and
would
Dinah
come
too
?
<EOS>
Seth
feel
that
that
be
the
great
happiness
he
could
look
forward
to
for
himself
,
though
he
have
no
hope
leave
that
she
would
ever
love
him
well
enough
to
marry
him
;
but
he
have
often
say
to
himself
,
it
be
well
to
be
Dinah
's
friend
and
brother
than
any
other
woman
's
husband
.
<EOS>
if
he
could
but
be
always
near
her
,
instead
of
live
so
far
off
!
  
<EOS>
He
come
downstairs
and
open
the
inner
door
lead
from
the
kitchen
into
the
workshop
,
intend
to
let
out
Gyp
;
but
he
stand
still
in
the
doorway
,
smitten
with
a
sudden
shock
at
the
sight
of
Adam
seat
listlessly
on
the
bench
,
pale
,
unwashed
,
with
sink
blank
eye
,
almost
like
a
drunkard
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
but
Seth
feel
in
an
instant
what
the
mark
mean
 
not
drunkenness
,
but
some
great
calamity
.
<EOS>
Adam
look
up
at
him
without
speak
,
and
Seth
move
forward
towards
the
bench
,
himself
tremble
so
that
speech
do
not
come
readily
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
have
mercy
on
us
,
Addy
,
"
he
say
,
in
a
low
voice
,
sit
down
on
the
bench
beside
Adam
,
"
what
be
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
be
unable
to
speak
.
<EOS>
the
strong
man
,
accustomed
to
suppress
the
sign
of
sorrow
,
have
feel
his
heart
swell
like
a
child
's
at
this
first
approach
of
sympathy
.
<EOS>
He
fall
on
Seth
's
neck
and
sobbed
.
  
<EOS>
Seth
be
prepare
for
the
bad
now
,
for
,
even
in
his
recollection
of
their
boyhood
,
Adam
have
never
sob
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
death
,
Adam
?
<EOS>
be
she
dead
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
in
a
low
tone
,
when
Adam
raise
his
head
and
be
recover
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
lad
;
but
she
be

<EOS>
go
away
from
us
.
<EOS>
She
be
never

Snowfield
.
<EOS>
Dinah
be
be
go
to
Leeds
ever
since
last
Friday
be
a
fortnight
,
the
very
day
Hetty
set
out
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
find
out
where
she
go
after
she
get
to
Stoniton
.
"
  
<EOS>
Seth
be
silent
from
utter
astonishment
:
he
know
nothing
that
could
suggest
to
him
a
reason
for
Hetty
's
go
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
hast
any
notion
what
she
be
do
it
for
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
can
not
ha
'
love
me
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
like
our
marriage
when
it
come
nigh
 
<EOS>
that
must
be
it
,
"
say
Adam
.
<EOS>
He
have
determine
to
mention
no
further
reason
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
Mother
stir
,
"
say
Seth
.
<EOS>
"
Must
we
tell
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
not
yet
,
"
say
Adam
,
rise
from
the
bench
and
push
the
hair
from
his
face
,
as
if
he
want
to
rouse
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
have
her
tell
yet
;
and
I
must
set
out
on
another
journey
directly
,
after
I
have
be
to
the
village
and
th
'
Hall
Farm
.
<EOS>
I

and
thee
must
say
to
her
<EOS>
I
be
go
on
business
as
nobody
be
to
know
anything
about
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
and
wash
myself
now
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Adam
move
towards
the
door
of
the
workshop
,
but
after
a
step
or
two
he
turn
round
,
and
,
meet
Seth
's
eye
with
a
calm
sad
glance
,
he
say
,
"
I
must
take
all
the
money
out
o
'
<EOS>
the
tin
box
,
lad
;
but
if

all
the
rest
will
be
thine
,
to
take
care

o

<EOS>
mother
with

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Seth
be
pale
and
tremble
:
he
feel
there
be
some
terrible
secret
under
all
this
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
brother
,
"
he
say
,
faintly
 
he
never
call
Adam
"
Brother
"
except
in
solemn
moment
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
you
will
do
anything
as
you
can
not
ask
God
's
blessing
on

<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay

say
Adam
,
"

<EOS>
I
be
for
do
nought
<EOS>
but
what
be
a
man
's
duty

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
thought
that
if
he
betray
his
trouble
to
his
mother
,
she
would
only
distress
him
by
word
,
half
of
blunder
affection
,
half
of
irrepressible
triumph
that
Hetty
prove
as
unfit
to
be
his
wife
as
she
have
always
foresee
,
bring
back
some
of
his
habitual
firmness
and
self
-
command
.
<EOS>
He
have
feel
ill
on
his
journey
home
 
<EOS>
he
tell
her
when
she
come
down
 
have
stay
all
night
at
Tredddleston
for
that
reason
;
and
a
bad
headache
,
that
still
hang
about
him
this
morning
,
account
for
his
paleness
and
heavy
eye
.
  
<EOS>
He
determine
to
go
to
the
village
,
in
the
first
place
,
attend
to
his
business
for
an
hour
,
and
give
notice
to
Burge
of
his
be
oblige
to
go
on
a
journey
,
which
he
must
beg
him
not
to

any
one
;
for
he
wish
to
avoid
go
to
the
Hall
Farm
near
breakfast
-
time
,
when
the
child
and
servant
would
be
in

house
-
place
,
and
there
must
be
exclamation
in
their
hearing
about
his
have
return
without
Hetty
.
<EOS>
He
wait
until
the
clock
strike
nine
before
he
leave
the
work
-
yard
at
the
village
,
and
set
off
,
through
the
field
,
towards
the
Farm
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
immense
relief
to
him
,
as
he
come
near
the
Home
Close
,
to
see
Mr.
Poyser
advance
towards
him
,
for
this
would
spare
him
the
pain
of

<EOS>
Mr.

briskly
this
March
morning

on
the
shoeing
of
a

His

but
he

Martin
be
silent
for

minute
or

on
the
ground

up
the

His

slowness

always
treble

painful

at

look
up

right
in

,

Adam
could

nothing

pursue
his

for

"
I

<EOS>
Adam
have
the
strong
motive
for
encourage
this
supposition
in
Mr.

and
he
even
try
to
believe
that
it
may
possibly
be
true
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
warrant
for
the
certainty
that

better

I
hope
you
will

"
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
Martin
Poyser
's
throat
at
that
moment
which
cause
him
to
bring
out
those
scanty
word
in
rather
a
broken
fashion
.
<EOS>
yet
Adam
know
what
they
mean
all
the
well

the
two
honest
man
grasp
each
other

hard
hand
in
mutual
understanding

<EOS>
there
be
nothing
now
to
hinder
Adam
from
set
off
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
Seth
to
go
to
the
Chase
and
leave
a
message
for
the
squire
,
say
that
Adam
Bede
have
be
oblige
to
start
off
suddenly
on
a
journey
 
and
to
say
as
much
,
and
no
more
,
to
any
one
else
who
make
inquiry
about
him
.
<EOS>
if
the
Poysers
learn
that
he
be
go
away
again
,
Adam
know
they
would
infer
that
he
be
go
in
search
of
Hetty
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
intend
to
go
right
on
his
way
from
the
Hall
Farm
,
but
now
the
impulse
which
have
frequently
visit
him
before
 
to
go
to
Mr.
Irwine
,
and
make
a
confidant
of
him
 
recur
with
the
new
force
which
belong
to
a
last
opportunity
.
<EOS>
He
be
about
to
start
on
a
long
journey
 
a
difficult
one
 
by
sea
 
and
no
soul
would
know
where
he
be
go
.
<EOS>
if
anything
happen
to
him
?
<EOS>
or
,
if
he
absolutely
need
help
in
any
matter
concern
Hetty
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
be
to
be
trust
;
and
the
feeling
which
make
Adam
shrink
from
tell
anything
which
be
her
secret
must
give
way
before
the
need
there
be
that
she
should
have
some
one
else
besides
himself
who
would
be
prepare
to
defend
her
in
the
bad
extremity
.
<EOS>
towards
Arthur
,
even
though
he
may
have
incur
no
new
guilt
,
Adam
feel
that
he
be
not
bind
to
keep
silence
when
Hetty
's
interest
call
on
him
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
do
it
,
"
say
Adam
,
when
these
thought
,
which
have
spread
themselves
through
hour
of
his
sad
journeying
,
now
rush
upon
him
in
an
instant
,
like
a
wave
that
have
be
slowly
gather
;
"
it
be
the
right
thing
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
stand
alone
in
this
way
any
longer
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
Tidings
  
ADAM
turn
his
face
towards
Broxton
and
walk
with
his
swift
stride
,
look
at
his
watch
with
the
fear
that
Mr.
Irwine
may
be
go
out
 
hunting
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
the
fear
and
haste
together
produce
a
state
of
strong
excitement
before
he
reach
the
rectory
gate
,
and
outside
it
he
see
the
deep
mark
of
a
recent
hoof
on
the
gravel
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
hoofs
be
turn
towards
the
gate
,
not
away
from
it
,
and
though
there
be
a
horse
against
the
stable
door
,
it
be
not
Mr.
Irwine
's
:
it
have
evidently
have
a
journey
this
morning
,
and
must
belong
to
some
one
who
have
come
on
business
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
be
at
home
,
then
;
but
Adam
could
hardly
find
breath
and
calmness
to
tell
Carroll
that
he
want
to
speak
to
the
rector
.
<EOS>
the
double
suffering
of
certain
and
uncertain
sorrow
have
begin
to
shake
the
strong
man
.
<EOS>
the
butler
look
at
him
wonderingly
,
as
he
throw
himself
on
a
bench
in
the
passage
and
stare
absently
at
the
clock
on
the
opposite
wall
.
<EOS>
the
master
have
somebody
with
him
,
he
say
,
but
he
hear
the
study
door
open
 
<EOS>
the
stranger
seem
to
be
come
out
,
and
as
Adam
be
in
a
hurry
,
he
would
let
the
master
know
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
sit
look
at
the
clock
:
the
minute
-
hand
be
hurry
along
the
last
five
minute
to
ten
with
a
loud
,
hard
,
indifferent
tick
,
and
Adam
watch
the
movement
and
listen
to
the
sound
as
if
he
have
have
some
reason
for
do
so
.
<EOS>
in
our
time
of
bitter
suffering
there
be
almost
always
these
pause
,
when
our
consciousness
be
benumb
to
everything
but
some
trivial
perception
or
sensation
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
semi
-
idiocy
come
to
give
us
rest
from
the
memory
and
the
dread
which
refuse
to
leave
us
in
our
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
Carroll
,
come
back
,
recall
Adam
to
the
sense
of
his
burden
.
<EOS>
He
be
to
go
into
the
study
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
think
what
that
strange
person
's
come
about
,
"
the
butler
add
,
from
mere
incontinence
of
remark
,
as
he
precede
Adam
to
the
door
,
"
he
be
go
<EOS>
i
'
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
and
master
look
unaccountable
 
as
if
he
be
frightened
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Adam
take
no
notice
of
the
word
:
he
could
not
care
about
other
people
's
business
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
enter
the
study
and
look
in
Mr.
Irwine
's
face
,
he
feel
in
an
instant
that
there
be
a
new
expression
in
it
,
strangely
different
from
the
warm
friendliness
it
have
always
wear
for
him
before
.
<EOS>
a
letter
lie
open
on
the
table
,
and
Mr.
Irwine
's
hand
be
on
it
,
but
the
change
glance
he
cast
on
Adam
could
not
be
owe
entirely
to
preoccupation
with
some
disagreeable
business
,
for
he
be
look
eagerly
towards
the
door
,
as
if
Adam
's
entrance
be
a
matter
of
poignant
anxiety
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
to
speak
to
me
,
Adam
,
"
he
say
,
in
that
low
constrainedly
quiet
tone
which
a
man
use
when
he
be
determined
to
suppress
agitation
.
<EOS>
"
sit
down
here
.
"
<EOS>
He
point
to
a
chair
just
opposite
to
him
,
at
no
more
than
a
yard
's
distance
from
his
own
,
and
Adam
sit
down
with
a
sense
that
this
cold
manner
of
Mr.
Irwine
's
give
an
additional
unexpected
difficulty
to
his
disclosure
.
<EOS>
but
when
Adam
have
make
up
his
mind
to
a
measure
,
he
be
not
the
man
to
renounce
it
for
any
but
imperative
reason
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
come
to
you
,
sir
,
"
he
say
,
"
as
the
gentleman
I
look
up
to
most
of
anybody

<EOS>
I
have
something
very
painful
to
tell
you
 
something
as
it
will
pain
you
to
hear
as
well

me
to
tell

<EOS>
but
if
I
speak
o

the
wrong
other
people
have
do
,
you
will
see
I
do
not
speak
till
I
would
good
reason

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
nod
slowly
,
and
Adam
go
on
rather
tremulously
,
"

up
from

she
take
the
coach
to
Stoniton

beyond
that
I
can
not

her

now
I
be
go

long
journey
to
look
for
her

<EOS>
Mr.

come
back
from

window
and
sit
down

have
you
no
idea

the
reason

away

It
be
plain
enough

She
do
not

there

<EOS>
a
gleam
of
something
 
<EOS>
it
be
almost
like
relief
or
joy
 
<EOS>
come
across
the
eager
anxiety
of
Mr.
Irwine

face
at
that
moment

<EOS>
Adam
be
look
on
the
ground

and
pause
a
little
:
the
next
word
be
hard
to
speak
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
go
on
,
he
lift
up
his
head
and
look
straight
at
Mr.

<EOS>
He
would
do
the
thing
he
have
resolve
to
do

without
flinch

"
You

<EOS>
Mr.

,
as
if
all
self

control
have
forsake
him

grasp
Adam
's
arm
,
which
lie
on
the
table

clutch
it
tightly
like
a

at
the
violence

repent
of
the

back

I
reproach
him

solemnly
to

no

than
a
bit
o
'
flirting
.
<EOS>
but
I
make
him
write
a
letter
to
tell
Hetty
he
would
mean
nothing
,
for
I
see
clear
enough
,
sir
,
by
several
thing
as
I
have
not
understand
at
the
time
,
as
he
would
get
hold
of
her
heart
,
and
I
think
she
would
belike
go
on
thinking
of
him
and
never
come
to
love
another
man
as
want
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
and
I
give
her
the
letter
,
and
she
seem
to
bear
it
all
after
a
while
better
than
I
would
expect
...
<EOS>
and
she
behave
kinder
and
kind
to
me
...
<EOS>
I
daresay
she
do
not
know
her
own
feeling
then
,
poor
thing
,
and
they
come
back
upon
her
when
it
be
too
late
...
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
to
blame
her
...
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
as
she
mean
to
deceive
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
encourage
to
think
she
love
me
,
and
 
you
know
the
rest
,
sir
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
on
my
mind
as
he
be
be
false
to
me
,
and
'
tice
her
away
,
and
she
be
go
to
him
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
go
now
to
see
,
<EOS>
for
I
can
never
go
to
work
again
till
I
know
what
be
become
of
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
during
Adam
's
narrative
,
Mr.
Irwine
have
have
time
to
recover
his
self
-
mastery
in
spite
of
the
painful
thought
that
crowd
upon
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
bitter
remembrance
to
him
now
 
that
morning
when
Arthur
breakfast
with
him
and
seem
as
if
he
be
on
the
verge
of
a
confession
.
<EOS>
It
be
plain
enough
now
what
he
have
want
to
confess
.
<EOS>
and
if
their
word
have
take
another
turn
...
if
he
himself
have
be
less
fastidious
about
intrude
on
another
man
's
secret
...
it
be
cruel
to
think
how
thin
a
film
have
shut
out
rescue
from
all
this
guilt
and
misery
.
<EOS>
He
see
the
whole
history
now
by
that
terrible
illumination
which
the
present
shed
back
upon
the
past
.
<EOS>
but
every
other
feeling
as
it
rush
upon
his
be
throw
into
abeyance
by
pity
,
deep
respectful
pity
,
for
the
man
who
sit
before
him
 
already
so
bruised
,
go
forth
with
sad
blind
resignedness
to
an
unreal
sorrow
,
while
a
real
one
be
close
upon
him
,
too
far
beyond
the
range
of
common
trial
for
him
ever
to
have
fear
it
.
<EOS>
His
own
agitation
be
quell
by
a
certain
awe
that
come
over
us
in
the
presence
of
a
great
anguish
,
for
the
anguish
he
must
inflict
on
Adam
be
already
present
to
him
.
<EOS>
again
he
put
his
hand
on
the
arm
that
lie
on
the
table
,
but
very
gently
this
time
,
as
he
say
solemnly
:
  
"
Adam
,
my
dear
friend
,
you
have
have
some
hard
trial
in
your
life

<EOS>
You
can
bear
sorrow
manfully
,
as
well
as
act
manfully
.
<EOS>
God
require
both
task
at
our
hand
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
a
heavy
sorrow
come
upon
you
than
any
you
have
yet
know
.
<EOS>
but
you
be
not
guilty
 
<EOS>
you
have
not
the
bad
of
all
sorrow
.
<EOS>
God
help
him
who
have
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
two
pale
face
look
at
each
other
;
in
Adam
's
there
be
tremble
suspense
,
in
Mr.
Irwine
's
hesitating
,
shrink
pity
.
<EOS>
but
he
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
have

<EOS>
She

Stonyshire
 
at
Stoniton

"
  
<EOS>
Adam
start
up
from
his
chair
,
as
if
he
think
he
could
have
leap
to
her
that
moment
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Irwine
lay
hold
of
his
arm
again
and
say
,
persuasively
,
"
wait
,
Adam
,
wait
.
"
<EOS>
so
he
sit
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
in
a
very
unhappy
position
 
one
which
will
make
it
bad
for
you
to
find
her
,
my
poor
friend
,
than
to
have
lose
her
for
ever

"
  
<EOS>
Adam
's
lip
move
tremulously
,
but
no
sound
come
.
<EOS>
They
move
again
,
and
he
whisper
,
"

me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
be
arrest
...
<EOS>
she
be
in
prison

"
  
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
an
insulting
blow
have
bring
back
the
spirit
of
resistance
into
Adam
.
<EOS>
the
blood
rush
to
his
face
,
and
he
say
,
loudly
and
sharply
,
"
<EOS>
for
what
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
for
a
great
crime
 
the
murder

Adam
almost
shout
,
start
up
from

make
a
stride
towards
the
door
;
but
he
turn
round
again
,
set
his
back
against
the
bookcase
,
and
look
fiercely
at
Mr.
Irwine
.
<EOS>
"
It

She

She

there

still
violently

with
an
effort

seem

look
at

corner

something
there

he
burst
out
again

in

tone
of
appeal
anguish

soothing
word
at

indeed
,
the
sight
of
Adam
before
him

with
that
look
of
sudden
age
which
sometimes
come
over
a
young
face
in
moment
of
terrible
emotion
 
the
hard
bloodless
look
of
the
skin
,
the
deep
line
about
the
quiver
mouth

the
furrow
in

the
sight
of
this
strong
firm
man
shatter
by
the
invisible
stroke
of
sorrow

move
him
so
deeply

speech
be
not
easy

Adam
stand
motionless
,
with
his
eye
vacantly
fix
in
this
way
for
a
minute

two

in

<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
give
up
his
intention
of
send
a
letter
to
meet
Arthur
,
since
it
would
not
now
hasten
his
return
:
the
news
of
his
grandfather
's
death
would
bring
him
as
soon
as
he
could
possibly
come
.
<EOS>
He
could
go
to
bed
now
and
get
some
needful
rest
,
before
the
time
come
for
the
morning
's
heavy
duty
of
carry
his
sickening
news
to
the
Hall
Farm
and
to
Adam
's
home
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
himself
be
not
come
back
from
Stoniton
,
for
though
he
shrink
from
see
Hetty
,
he
could
not
bear
to
go
to
a
distance
from
her
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
no
use
,
sir
,
"
he
say
to
the
rector
,
"
it
be
no
use
for
me
to
go
back
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
go
to
work
again
while
she
be
here
,
and
I
could
not
bear
the
sight
<EOS>
o
'
the
thing
and
folk
round
home
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
a
bit
of
a
room
here
,
where
I
can
see
the
prison
wall
,
and
perhaps
I
shall
get
,
in
time
,
to
bear
see
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
have
not
be
shake
in
his
belief
that
Hetty
be
innocent
of
the
crime
she
be
charge
with
,
for
Mr.
Irwine
,
feel
that
the
belief
in
her
guilt
would
be
a
crush
addition
to
Adam
's
load
,
have
keep
from
him
the
fact
which
leave
no
hope
in
his
own
mind
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
any
reason
for
thrust
the
whole
burden
on
Adam
at
once
,
and
Mr.
Irwine
,
at
parting
,
only
say
,
"
if
the
evidence
should
tell
too
strongly
against
her
,
Adam
,
we
may
still
hope
for
a
pardon
.
<EOS>
Her
youth
and
other
circumstance
will
be
a
plea
for
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
and
it
be
right
people
should
know
how
she
be
tempt
into
the
wrong
way
,
"
say
Adam
,
with
bitter
earnestness
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
right
they
should
know
it
be
a
fine
gentleman
make
love
to
her
,
and
turn
her
head
wi
'
notion
.
<EOS>
You
will
remember
,
sir
,
you
have
promise
to
tell
my
mother
,
and
Seth
,
and
the
people
at
the
farm
,
who
it
be
as
lead
her
wrong
,
else
they
will
think
harder
of
her
than
she
deserve
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
do
her
a
hurt
by
spare
him
,
and
I
hold
him
the
guilty
before
God
,
let
her
ha
'
do
what
she
may
.
<EOS>
if
you
spare
him
,
I
will
expose
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
your
demand
be
just
,
Adam
,
"
say
Mr.
Irwine
,
"
<EOS>
but
when
you
be
calm
,
you
will
judge
Arthur
more
mercifully
.
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
now
,
only
that
his
punishment
be
in
other
hand
than
our
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
feel
it
hard
upon
him
that
he
should
have
to
tell
of
Arthur
's
sad
part
in
the
story
of
sin
and
<EOS>
sorrow
 
he
who
care
for
Arthur
with
fatherly
affection
,
who
have
care
for
him
with
fatherly
pride
.
<EOS>
but
he
see
clearly
that
the
secret
must
be
know
before
long
,
even
apart
from
Adam
's
determination
,
since
it
be
scarcely
to
be
suppose
that
Hetty
would
persist
to
the
end
in
her
obstinate
silence
.
<EOS>
He
make
up
his
mind
to
withhold
nothing
from
the
Poysers
,
but
to
tell
them
the
bad
at
once
,
for
there
be
no
time
to
rob
the
tiding
of
their
suddenness
.
<EOS>
Hetty
's
trial
must
come
on
at
the
Lent
assize
,
and
they
be
to
be
hold
at
Stoniton
the
next
week
.
<EOS>
It
be
scarcely
to
be
hope
that
Martin
Poyser
could
escape
the
pain
of
be
call
as
a
witness
,
and
it
be
well
he
should
know
everything
as
long
beforehand
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
before
ten
o'clock
on
Thursday
morning
the
home
at
the
Hall
Farm
be
a
house
of
mourn
for
a
misfortune
feel
to
be
bad
than
death
.
<EOS>
the
sense
of
family
dishonour
be
too
keen
even
in
the
kind
-
hearted
Martin
Poyser
the
young
to
leave
room
for
any
compassion
towards
Hetty
.
<EOS>
He
and
his
father
be
simple
-
minded
farmer
,
proud
of
their
untarnished
character
,
proud
that
they
come
of
a
family
which
have
hold
up
its
head
and
pay
its
way
as
far
back
as
its
name
be
in
the
parish
register
;
and
Hetty
have
bring
disgrace
on
them
all
 
disgrace
that
could
never
be
wipe
out
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
all
-
conquering
feeling
in
the
mind
both
of
father
and
son
 
the
scorching
sense
of
disgrace
,
which
neutralise
all
other
sensibility
 
and
Mr.
Irwine
be
strike
with
surprise
to
observe
that
Mrs.
Poyser
be
less
severe
than
her
husband
.
<EOS>
We
be
often
startle
by
the
severity
of
mild
people
on
exceptional
occasion
;
the
reason
be
,
that
mild
people
be
most
liable
to
be
under
the
yoke
of
traditional
impression
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
willing
to

any
money

Martin
the

evening
there
be
few
people
in
Broxton
and
Hayslope
who
have
not
hear
the
sad
news
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
have
not
mention
Arthur
's
name
to
Burge
,
and
yet
the
story
of
his
conduct
towards
Hetty
,
with
all
the
dark
shadow
cast
upon
it
by
its
terrible
consequence
,
be
presently
as
well
know
as
that
his
grandfather
be
dead
,
and
that
he
be
come
into
the
estate
.
<EOS>
for
Martin
Poyser
feel
no
motive
to
keep
silence
towards
the
one
or
two
neighbour
who
venture
to
come
and
shake
him
sorrowfully
by
the
hand
on
the
first
day
of
his
trouble
;
and
Carroll
,
who
keep
his
ear
open
to
all
that
pass
at
the
rectory
,
have
frame
an
inferential
version
of
the
story
,
and
find
early
opportunity
of
communicate
it
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
those
neighbour
who
come
to
Martin
Poyser
and
shake
him
by
the
hand
without
speak
for
some
minute
be
Bartle
Massey
.
<EOS>
He
have
shut
up
his
school
,
and
be
on
his
way
to
the
rectory
,
where
he
arrive
about
half
-
past
seven
in
the
evening
,
and
,
send
his
duty
to
Mr.
Irwine
,
beg
pardon
for
trouble
him
at
that
hour
,
but
have
something
particular
on
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
be
show
into
the
study
,
where
Mr.
Irwine
soon
join
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Bartle
?
"
say
Mr.
Irwine
,
put
out
his
hand
.
<EOS>
that
be
not
his
usual
way
of
salute
the
schoolmaster
,
but
trouble
make
us
treat
all
who
feel
with
us
very
much
alike
.
<EOS>
"
sit
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
I
be
come
about
as
well
as
I
do
,
sir
,
I
daresay
,
"
say
Bartle
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wish
to
know
the
truth
about
the
sad
news
that
have
reach
you
...
about
Hetty
Sorrel
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
sir
,
what
I
wish
to
know
be
about
Adam
Bede
.
<EOS>
I
understand
you
leave
him
at
Stoniton
,
and
I
beg
the
favour
of
you
to
tell
me
what
be
the
state
of
the
poor
lad
's
mind
,
and
what
he
mean
to
do
.
<EOS>
for
as
for
that
bit
o
'
pink
-
and
-
white
they
have
take
the
trouble
to
put
in
jail
,
I
do
not
value
her
a
rotten
nut
 
not
a
rotten
nut
 
only
for
the
harm
or
good
that
may
come
out
of
her
to
an
honest
man
 
a
lad
I
have
set
such
store
by
 
trust
to
,
that
he
would
make
my
bit
<EOS>
o
'
knowledge
go
a
good
way
in
the
world
....
<EOS>
why
,
sir
,
he
be
the
only
scholar
I
have
have
in
this
stupid
country
that
ever
have
the
will
or
the
head
-
piece
for
mathematic
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
not
have
so
much
hard
work
to
do
,
poor
fellow
,
he
may
have
go
into
the
high
branch
,
and
then
this
may
never
have
happen
 
may
never
have
happen
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bartle
be
heat
by
the
exertion
of
walk
fast
in
an
agitated
frame
of
mind
,
and
be
not
able
to
check
himself
on
this
first
occasion
of
vent
his
feeling
.
<EOS>
but
he
pause
now
to
rub
his
moist
forehead
,
and
probably
his
moist
eye
also
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
excuse
me
,
sir
,
"
he
say
,
when
this
pause
have
give
him
time
to
reflect
,
"
for
run
on
in
this
way
about
my
own
feeling
,
like
that
foolish
dog
of
mine
howl
in
a
storm
,
when
there
be
nobody
want
to
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
come
to
hear
you
speak
,
not
to
talk
myself
 
if
you
will
take
the
trouble
to
tell
me
what
the
poor
lad
's
doing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
put
yourself
under
any
restraint
,
Bartle
,
"
say
Mr.
Irwine
.
<EOS>
"
the
fact
be
,
I
be
very
much
in
the
same
condition
as
you
just
now
;
I
have
a
great
deal
that
be
painful
on
my
mind
,
and
I
find
it
hard
work
to
be
quite
silent
about
my
own
feeling
and
only
attend
to
other
.
<EOS>
I
share
your
concern
for
Adam
,
though
he
be
not
the
only
one
whose
suffering
I
care
for
in
this
affair
.
<EOS>
He
intend
to
remain
at
Stoniton
till
after
the
trial
:
it
will
come
on
probably
a
week
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
have
take
a
room
there
,
and
I
encourage
him
to
do
so
,
because
I
think
it
better
he
should
be
away
from
his
own
home
at
present
;
and
,
poor
fellow
,
he
still
believe
Hetty
be
innocent
 
<EOS>
he
want
to
summon
up
courage
to
see
her
if
he
can
;
he
be
unwilling
to
leave
the
spot
where
she
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
the
creatur
's
guilty
,
then
?
"
say
Bartle
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
they
will
hang
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
it
will
go
hard
with
her
.
<EOS>
the
evidence
be
very
strong
.
<EOS>
and
one
bad
symptom
be
that
she
deny
everything
 
deny
that
she
have
have
a
child
in
the
face
of
the
most
positive
evidence
.
<EOS>
I
see
her
myself
,
and
she
be
obstinately
silent
to
me
;
she
shrink
up
like
a
frightened
animal
when
she
see
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
never
so
shocked
in
my
life
as
at
the
change
in
her
.
<EOS>
but
I
trust
that
,
in
the
bad
case
,
we
may
obtain
a
pardon
for
the
sake
of
the
innocent
who
be
involve
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
stuff
and
nonsense
!
"
say
Bartle
,
forget
in
his
irritation
to
whom
he
be
speak
.
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
I
mean
it
be
stuff
and
nonsense
for
the
innocent
to
care
about
her
be
hang
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
think
the
sooner
such
woman
be
put
out
o
'
the
world
the
well
;
and
the
man
that
help
'em
to
do
mischief
have
better
go
along
with
'em
for
that
matter
.
<EOS>
what
good
will
you
do
by
keep
such
vermin
alive
,
eat
the
victual
that
'
ud
feed
rational
being
?
<EOS>
but
if
Adam
's
fool
enough
to
care
about
it
,
I
do
not
want
him
to
suffer
<EOS>
more
than
's
needful
....
<EOS>
be
he
very
much
cut
up
,
poor
fellow
?
"
<EOS>
Bartle
add
,
take
out
his
spectacle
and
put
them
on
,
as
if
they
would
assist
his
imagination

<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
be
afraid
the
grief
cut
very
deep
,
"
say
Mr.
Irwine
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
look
terribly
shatter
,
and
a
certain
violence
come
over
him
now
and
then
yesterday
,
which
make
me
wish
I
could
have
remain
near
him
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
go
to
Stoniton
again
to
-
morrow
,
and
I
have
confidence
enough
in
the
strength
of
Adam
's
principle
to
trust
that
he
will
be
able
to
endure
the
bad
without
be
drive
to
anything
rash

<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
,
who
be
involuntarily
utter
his
own
thought
rather
than
address
Bartle
Massey
in
the
last
sentence
,
have
in
his
mind
the
possibility
that
the
spirit
of
vengeance
to
-
ward
Arthur
,
which
be
the
form
Adam
's
anguish
be
continually
take
,
may
make
him
seek
an
encounter
that
be
likely
to
end
more
fatally
than
the
one
in
the
Grove
.
<EOS>
this
possibility
heighten
the
anxiety
with
which
he
look
forward
to
Arthur
's
arrival
.
<EOS>
but
Bartle
think
Mr.
Irwine
be
refer
to
suicide
,
and
his
face
wear
a
new
alarm
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
I
have
in
my
head

sir

"
he

,
"
and
I
hope
you
will
approve
of
it

<EOS>
I
be
go
to
shut
up
my
school
 
<EOS>
if
the
scholar
come
,
they
must
go
back
again
<EOS>
,
that
be
all
 
<EOS>
and
I
shall
go
to
Stoniton
and
look
after
Adam
till
this
business
be
over
.
<EOS>
I
will
pretend
I
be
come
to
look
on
at
the
assize
;
he
can
not
object
to
that

<EOS>
what
do
you
think
about
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well

Mr.

rather

You

His

have
get
thin

he
have
the
sink
eye

the
neglect

just

from

sick

<EOS>
His
heavy
black
hair

off

more
awake

He

It

the

may
affect

favourably

I
grieve

have
scarcely
any

She

not

agitated

she

"
no

cold

obstinate
way

if
the
meeting

it

be
pure

useless

that

Adam

"
Mr.

answer
gently
.
<EOS>
"
in
these
case
we
sometimes
form
our
judgment
on
what
seem
to
us
strong
evidence
,
and
yet
,
for
want
of
know
some
small
fact
,
our
judgment
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
but
suppose
the
bad
:
you
have
no
right
to
say
that
the
guilt
of
her
crime
lie
with
him
,
and
that
he
ought
to
bear
the
punishment
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
for
us
man
to
apportion
the
share
of
moral
guilt
and
retribution
.
<EOS>
We
find
it
impossible
to
avoid
mistake
even
in
determine
who
have
commit
a
single
criminal
act
,
and
the
problem
how
far
a
man
be
to
be
hold
responsible
for
the
unforeseen
consequence
of
his
own
deed
be
one
that
may
well
make
us
tremble
to
look
into
it

<EOS>
the
evil
consequence
that
may
lie
fold
in
a
single
act
of
selfish
indulgence
be
a
thought
so
awful
that
it
ought
surely
to
awaken
some
feeling
less
presumptuous
than
a
rash
desire
to
punish
.
<EOS>
You
have
a
mind
that
can
understand
this
fully
,
Adam
,
when
you
be
calm

<EOS>
do
not
suppose
I
can
not
enter
into
the
anguish
that
drive
you
into
this
state
of
revengeful
hatred
.
<EOS>
but
think
of
this
:
if
you
be
to
obey
your
passion
 
for
it
be
passion
,
and
you
deceive
yourself
in
call
it
justice
 
<EOS>
it
may
be
with
you
precisely
as
it
have
be
with
Arthur
;
nay
,
bad
;
your
passion
may
lead
you
yourself
into
a
horrible
crime

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
 
not

He

he

no

anything

there
again
you
partly
deceive
yourself
,
Adam

<EOS>
there
be
no
sort
of
wrong
deed
of
which
a
man
can
bear
the
punishment
alone
;
you
can
not
isolate
yourself

say
that

evil
which
be
in

shall
not

air
they
breathe

<EOS>
evil
spread
as
necessarily
as
disease

<EOS>
I
know
,
I
feel
the
terrible
extent
of
suffer
this
sin
of
Arthur

have
cause
to
other

but
so
do
every
sin
cause
suffer
to
other
besides
those
who
commit
it

<EOS>
an
act
of
vengeance
on
your
part
against
Arthur
would
simply
be
another
evil
add
to
those
we
be
suffer
under
:
you
could
not
bear
the
punishment
alone
;
you
would
entail
the
bad
sorrow
on
every

love
you

You
would
have
commit
an
act
of
blind
fury
that
would
leave
all
the
present
evil
just
as
they
be
and
add
bad
evil
to
them
.
<EOS>
You
may
tell
me
that
you
meditate
no
fatal
act
of
vengeance
,
but
the
feeling
in
your
mind
be
what
give
birth
to
such
action
,

as
long
as
you

it

as

the
Morning
of

Trial

at
one
o'clock
the
next
day

Adam
be
alone
in
his
dull
upper
room
;
his
watch
lie
before
him
on
the
table
,
as
if
he
be
count
the
long
minute
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
knowledge
of
what
be
likely
to
be
say
by
the
witness
on
the
trial
,
for
he
have
shrink
from
all
the
particular
connect
with
Hetty
's
arrest
and
accusation
.
<EOS>
this
brave
active
man
,
who
would
have
hasten
towards
any
danger
or
toil
to
rescue
Hetty
from
an
apprehend
wrong
or
misfortune
,
feel
himself
powerless
to
contemplate
irremediable
evil
and
suffering
.
<EOS>
the
susceptibility
which
would
have
be
an
impelling
force
where
there
be
any
possibility
of
action
become
helpless
anguish
when
he
be
oblige
to
be
passive
,
or
else
seek
an
active
outlet
in
the
thought
of
inflict
justice
on
Arthur
.
<EOS>
energetic
nature
,
strong
for
all
strenuous
deed
,
will
often
rush
away
from
a
hopeless
sufferer
,
as
if
they
be
hard
-
hearted
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
overmastering
sense
of
pain
that
drive
them
.
<EOS>
They
shrink
by
an
ungovernable
instinct
,
as
they
would
shrink
from
laceration
.
<EOS>
Adam
have
bring
himself
to
think
of
see
Hetty
,
if
she
would
consent
to
see
him
,
because
he
think
the
meeting
may
possibly
be
a
good
to
her
 
may
help
to
melt
away
this
terrible
hardness
they
tell
him
of
.
<EOS>
if
she
see
he
bear
her
no
ill
will
for
what
she
have
do
to
him
,
she
may
open
her
heart
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
this
resolution
have
be
an
immense
effort
 
<EOS>
he
tremble
at
the
thought
of
see
her
changed
face
,
as
a
timid
woman
tremble
at
the
thought
of
the
surgeon
's
knife
,
and
he
choose
now
to
bear
the
long
hour
of
suspense
rather
than
encounter
what
seem
to
him
the
more
intolerable
agony
of
witness
her
trial
.
  
<EOS>
deep
unspeakable
suffering
may
well
be
call
a
baptism
,
a
regeneration
,
the
initiation
into
a
new
state

<EOS>
the
yearning
memory
,
the
bitter
regret

the
agonize
sympathy

the
struggle
appeal

the
Invisible
<EOS>
Right
 
all
the
intense
emotion
which
have
fill
the
day
and
night
of
the
past
week
,
and
be
compress
themselves
again
like
an
eager
crowd
into
the
hour
of
this
single
morning
,
make
Adam
look
back
on
all
the
previous
year
as
if
they
have
be
a
dim
sleepy
existence
,
and
he
have
only
now
awake
to
full
consciousness
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
him
as
if
he
have
always
before
think
it
a
light
thing
that
man
should
suffer
,
as
if
all
that
he
have
himself
endure
and
call
sorrow
before
be
only
a
moment
's
stroke
that
have
never
leave
a
bruise
.
<EOS>
doubtless
a
great
anguish
may
do
the
work
of
year
,
and
we
may
come
out
from
that
baptism
of
fire
with
a
soul
full
of
new
awe
and
new
pity
.
  
<EOS>
"
o
God
,

Adam
groan
,
as
he
lean
on
the
table
and
look
blankly
at
the
face
of
the
watch
,
"
and
man
have
suffer

<EOS>
Adam
start
and
look
round
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
Vixen
have
begin
to
whimper
,
and
there
be
a
sound
of
a
stick
and
a
lame
walk
on
the
stair
.
<EOS>
It
be
Bartle
Massey

back
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
all
over

<EOS>
Bartle
enter
quietly
,

,
go
up
to
Adam

grasp
his

say
,
"

Adam

so
violently
he
be
unable

<EOS>
he
could
only
return
the
pressure
of
his

Bartle
,
draw
up
the

come
and
sit
in

"
  
<EOS>
the
old
man
make
this
trivial
remark
,
think
it
better
not
to
respond
at
all
to
Adam
's
agitation
:
he
would
gather
,
in
an
indirect
way
,
that
there
be
nothing
decisive
to
communicate
at
present
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
"
he

,
rise
again

yes

my

yes
 
it
be
take
all
the

I
first
go

they
be
slow
,
they
be
slow
;
and
there
be
the
counsel
they
have
get
for
her
put
a
speak
in
the
wheel
whenever
he
can
,
and
make
a
deal
to
do
with
cross
-
examine
the
witness
and
quarrel
with
the
other
lawyer
.
<EOS>
that
be
all
he
can
do
for
the
money
they
give
him
;
and
it
be
a
big
sum
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
big
sum

<EOS>
but
he
be
a

cute
fellow

with
an
eye

pick

out

if

no

it

be
as
good
as
a
demonstration
to
listen
to
what
go
on
in

a
tender

make
one
stupid

<EOS>
I
would
have
give
up
figure

to
have
have

to
bring

do

"
tell

what
they
have

I
must
know

they
have

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
the
chief
evidence
yet
have
be
the

all

Martin
Poyser
 
poor
Martin

<EOS>
everybody
in

feel
for
him
 
<EOS>
it
be
like
one
sob

the
sound
they
make
when

come
down
again

<EOS>
the
bad
be
when
they
tell
him
to
look
at
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
.
<EOS>
It
be
hard
work
,
poor
fellow
 
<EOS>
it
be

<EOS>
Adam
,
my

the
blow
fall
heavily
on
him

you
must
help

;
you
must
show
courage
.
<EOS>
drink
some
wine
now
,
and
show
me
you
mean
to
bear
it
like
a
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bartle
have
make
the
right
sort
of
appeal
.
<EOS>
Adam
,
with
an
air
of
quiet
obedience
,
take
up
the
cup
and
drink
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
tell
me
how
she
look
,
"
he
say
presently
.
  
<EOS>
"
frightened
,
very
frightened
,
when
they
first
bring
her
in
;
it
be
the
first
sight
of
the
crowd
and
the
judge
,
poor
creatur
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
a
lot
o
'
foolish
woman
in
fine
clothe
,
with
gewgaw
all
up
their
arm
and
feather
on
their
head
,
sit
near
the
judge
:
they
have
dress
themselves
out
in
that
way
,
one
'
ud
think
,
to
be
scarecrow
and
warning
against
any
man
ever
meddle
with
a
woman
again
.
<EOS>
They
put
up
their
glass
,
and
stare
and
whisper
.
<EOS>
but
after
that
she
stand
like
a
white
image
,
stare
down
at
her
hand
and
seem
neither
to
hear
nor
see
anything
.
<EOS>
and
she
be
as
white
as
a
sheet
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
speak
when
they
ask
her
if
she
would
plead
"
guilty
"
or
"
not
guilty
,
"
and
they
plead
"
not
guilty
"
for
her
.
<EOS>
but
when
she
hear
her
uncle
's
name
,
there
seem
to
go
a
shiver
right
through
her
;
and
when
they
tell
him
to
look
at
her
,
she
hang
her
head
down
,
and
cower
,
and
hide
her
face
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
He
would
much
ado
to
speak
poor
man
,
his
voice
tremble
so
.
<EOS>
and
the
counsellor
 
who
look
as
hard
as
nail
mostly
 
I
see
,
spare
him
as
much
as
they
could
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
put
himself
near
him
and
go
with
him
out
o

court
.
<EOS>
ah
,
it
be
a
great
thing
in
a
man
's
life
to
be
able
to
stand
by
a
neighbour

uphold
him
in
such
trouble
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
him

you

Mr.

say
Adam
,
in
a
low
voice

lay
his
hand
on
Bartle
's
arm

<EOS>
"
aye

aye

he

a

no

than
's
needful

<EOS>
He
be
not
one
of
those
that
think
they
can
comfort
you
with
chattering
,
as
if
folk
who
stand
by
and
look
on
know
a

better
what
the
trouble
be
than
those
who
have
to
bear
it

I
have
have
to
do
with
such
folk
in
my
time
 
in
the
south
,
when
I
be
in
trouble
myself

<EOS>
Mr.

be
to
be
a
witness
himself

by
and
by
,
on

side

you
know

to
speak
to
her
character

bring
up

the

do
it
go
hard
against

what
do
you
think

Mr.

<EOS>
tell
me
the
truth

yes

my

yes

<EOS>
the
truth
be
the
good

to
tell

It
must
come
at

<EOS>
the
doctor

evidence
be
heavy
on
her
 
be
heavy

<EOS>
but
she
be
go
on
deny

a

<EOS>
these
poor

thing
 
<EOS>
they
have
not
the
sense
to
know
it
be
no
use
deny
what
be
prove

<EOS>
It
will
make
against
her
with
the
jury
,
I
doubt
,
her
be
so
obstinate
:
they
may
be
less
for
recommend
her
to
mercy
,
if
the
verdict
be
against
her

<EOS>
but
Mr.

'
ull
leave
no
stone
unturned

may
rely

Adam

be
there
nobody

Adam

<EOS>
"
there
be
the
chaplain

another

there
be

Adam

presently
he
draw
himself
up

out

apparently
turn
over

We

I

I

never

again

<EOS>
I
will
go
,
Mr.
Massey
 
I
will
go
with
you

"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
decision
in
Adam
's
manner
which
would
have
prevent
Bartle
from
oppose
him
,
even
if
he
have
wish
to
do
so

<EOS>
He
only
say
,
"
take
a

then
,

another

for

nerve
by
an
active
resolution
,
Adam
take
a
morsel
of
bread
and
drank
some
wine

<EOS>
He
be
haggard
and
unshaven
,
as
he
have
be
yesterday
,
but
he
stand
upright
again
,
and
look
more
like
the
Adam

of
former

the
Verdict
  
<EOS>
the
place
fit
up

<EOS>
the
midday
light
that
fall
on
the
close
pavement
of
human

be
shed
through
a
line
of
high
point
window

variegate
with
the
mellow
tint

old

grim
dusty

hang
in
high
relief
in

the
dark
oaken
gallery
at

under
the
broad
arch
of
the
great
mullione
window
opposite
be
spread
a
curtain
of
old
tapestry
,
cover
with
dim
melancholy
figure
,
like
a
doze
indistinct
dream

It
be
a
place

through

be
haunt
with
the
shadowy
memory
of
old
king

unhappy

discrowned

all
those

that
sorrow
seem
to
have
make
it
itself
feebly
feel
hitherto

now
when
Adam
Bede
's
tall
figure
be
suddenly
see
be
usher
to
the
side
of
the
prisoner

dock

in

him
in

of
his
small
room

the

from
Hayslope
who
be
present

and
who
tell
Hetty
Sorrel
's
story
by
their
fireside
in
their
old
age

never

how
it
move
them
when
Adam
Bede
,
poor
fellow
,
tall
by
the
head
than
most
of
the
people
round
him

come
into
court

take
his
place
by
her
side

Hetty
do
not

him

She
be

in
the

position
Bartle
Massey
have
describe
,
her
hand
cross
over
each
other

her
eye
fix
on
them

Adam
have
not

her
in

first
moment

at
last
,
when
the
attention

the
court
be
withdraw
by
the
proceeding
he
turn
his
face
towards
her
with
a
resolution
not

shrink

<EOS>
why
do
they
say
she
be
so
change
?
<EOS>
in
the
corpse
we
love

it
be
the
likeness
we
see
 
<EOS>
it
be
the
likeness
,
which
make
itself
feel
the
more
keenly
because
something

there
they
be
 
the

with

the
long
dark
lash

the
rounded
cheek

the
pouting
lip
 
<EOS>
pale
and
thin
,
yes
,
but
like
Hetty
,
and
only
Hetty
.
<EOS>
other
think
she
look
as
if
some
demon
have
cast
a
blight
glance
upon
her
,
wither
up
the
woman
's
soul
in
her
,

leave
only
a
hard
despairing
obstinacy

the

yearning
,
that
complete
type
of
the
life
in
another
life
which
be
the
essence
of
real
human

feel
the
presence
of
the
cherish
child
even
in
the
debased

degraded
man

and
to
Adam
,
this
pale
,
hard

looking
culprit
be
the
Hetty
who
have
smile
at
him
in
the
garden
under
the
apple

tree
bough
 
<EOS>
she
be
that
Hetty

he
have
tremble
to
look
at
the
first
time

and
then
be
unwilling
to
turn
away
his
eye
from

<EOS>
but
presently
he
hear
something
that
compel
him
to
listen
,

make
the
sense

sight
less
absorbing

a

prisoner
begin
to
cry
,
and
say
she
be
too
tired
to
go
anywhere
else
,
and
she
only
want
a
bed
for
one
night
.
<EOS>
and
her
prettiness
,
and
her
condition
,
and
something
respectable
about
her
clothe
and
look
,
and
the
trouble
she
seem
to
be
in
make
me
as
I
could
not
find
in
my
heart
to
send
her
away
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
ask
her
to
sit
down
,
and
give
her
some
tea
,
and
ask
her
where
she
be
go
,
and
where
her
friend
be
.
<EOS>
She
say
she
be
go
home
to
her
friend
:
they
be
farm
folk
a
good
way
off
,
and
she
would
have
a
long
journey
that
have
cost
her
more
money
than
she
expect
,
so
as
she
would
hardly
any
money
leave
in
her
pocket
,
and
be
afraid
of
go
where
it
would
cost
her
much
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
oblige
to
sell
most
of
the
thing
out
of
her
basket
,
but
she
would
thankfully
give
a
shilling
for
a
bed
.
<EOS>
I
see
no
reason
why
I
should
not
take
the
young
woman
in
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
one
room
,
but
there
be
two
bed
in
it
,
and
I
tell
her
she
may
stay
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
would
be
lead
wrong
,
and
get
into
trouble
,
but
if
she
be
go
to
her
friend
,
it
would
be
a
good
work
to
keep
her
out
of
further
harm
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
witness
then
state
that
in
the
night
a
child
be
bear
,
and
she
identify
the
baby
-
clothe
then
show
to
her
as
those
in
which
she
have
herself
dress
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
those
be
the
clothe
.
<EOS>
I
make
them
myself
,
and
have
keep
them
by
me
ever
since
my
last
child
be
bear
.
<EOS>
I
take
a
deal
of
trouble
both
for
the
child
and
the
mother
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
take
to
the
little
thing
and
be
anxious
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
send
for
a
doctor
,
for
there
seem
no
need
.
<EOS>
I
tell
the
mother
in
the
day
-
time
she
must
tell
me
the
name
of
her
friend
,
and
where
they
live
,
and
let
me
write
to
them
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
by
and
by
she
would
write
herself
,
but
not
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
no
nay
,
but
she
would
get
up
and
be
dress
,
in
spite
of
everything
I
could
say
.
<EOS>
She
say
she
feel
quite
strong
enough
;
and
it
be
wonderful
what
spirit
she
show
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
quite
easy
what
I
should
do
about
her
,
and
towards
evening
I
make
up
my
mind
<EOS>
I
would
go
,
after
Meeting
be
over
,
and
speak
to
our
minister
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
leave
the
house
about
half
-
past
eight
o'clock
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
go
out
at
the
shop
door
,
but
at
the
back
door
,
which
open
into
a
narrow
alley
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
get
the
ground
-
floor
of
the
house
,
and
the
kitchen
and
bedroom
both
look
into
the
alley
.
<EOS>
I
leave
the
prisoner
sit
up
by
the
fire
in
the
kitchen
with
the
baby
on
her
lap
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
cry
or
seem
low
at
all
,
as
she
do
the
night
before
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
have
a
strange
look
with
her
eye
,
and
she
get
a
bit
flushed
towards
evening
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
of
the
fever
,
and
I
think
I
would
call
and
ask
an
acquaintance
of
mine
,
an
experienced
woman
,
to
come
back
with
me
when
I
go
out
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
dark
night
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
fasten
the
door
behind
me
;
there
be
no
lock
;
it
be
a
latch
with
a
bolt
inside
,
and
when
there
be
nobody
in
the
house
I
always
go
out
at
the
shop
door
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
there
be
no
danger
in
leave
it
unfasten
that
little
while
.
<EOS>
I
be
long
than
I
mean
to
be
,
for
I
have
to
wait
for
the
woman
that
come
back
with
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
hour
and
a
half
before
we
get
back
,
and
when
we
go
in
,
the
candle
be
stand
burn
just
as
I
leave
it
,
but
the
prisoner
and
the
baby
be
both
go
.
<EOS>
She
would
take
her
cloak
and
bonnet
,
but
she
would
leave
the
basket
and
the
thing
in
it
....
<EOS>
I
be
dreadful
frightened
,
and
angry
with
her
for
go
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
go
to
give
information
,
because
I
would
no
thought
she
mean
to
do
any
harm
,
and
I
know
she
have
money
in
her
pocket
to
buy
her
food
and
lodging
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
to
set
the
constable
after
her
,
for
she
would
a
right
to
go
from
me
if
she
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
effect
of
this
evidence
on
Adam
be
electrical
;
it
give
him
new
force
.
<EOS>
Hetty
could
not
be
guilty
of
the
crime
 
<EOS>
her
heart
must
have
cling
to
her
baby
 
else
why
should
she
have
take
it
with
her
?
<EOS>
She
may
have
leave
it
behind
.
<EOS>
the
little
creature
have
die
naturally
,
and
then
she
have
hide
it
.
<EOS>
baby
be
so
liable
to
death
 
<EOS>
and
there
may
be
the
strong
suspicion
without
any
proof
of
guilt
.
<EOS>
His
mind
be
so
occupied
with
imaginary
argument
against
such
suspicion
,
that
he
could
not
listen
to
the
cross
-
examination
by
Hetty
's
counsel
,
who
try
,
without
result
,
to
elicit
evidence
that
the
prisoner
have
show
some
movement
of
maternal
affection
towards
the
child
.
<EOS>
the
whole
time
this
witness
be
be
examine
,
Hetty
have
stand
as
motionless
as
before
:
no
word
seem
to
arrest
her
ear
.
<EOS>
but
the
sound
of
the
next
witness
's
voice
touch
a
chord
that
be
still
sensitive
,
she
give
a
start
and
a
frightened
look
towards
him
,
but
immediately
turn
away
her
head
and
look
down
at
her
hand
as
before
.
<EOS>
this
witness
be
a
man
,
a
rough
peasant
.
<EOS>
He
say
:
  
"
My
name
be
John
Olding
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
labourer
,
and
live
at
Tedd
's
Hole
,
two
mile
out
of
Stoniton
.
<EOS>
a
week
last
Monday
,
towards
one
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
I
be
go
towards
Hetton
Coppice
,
and
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
coppice
I
see
the
prisoner
,
in
a
red
cloak
,
sit
under
a
bit
of
a
haystack
not
far
off
the
stile
.
<EOS>
She
get
up
when
she
see
me
,
and
seem
as
if
she
would
be
walk
on
the
other
way
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
regular
road
through
the
field
,
and
nothing
very
uncommon
to
see
a
young
woman
there
,
but
I
take
notice
of
her
because
she
look
white
and
scared
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
think
she
be
a
beggar
-
woman
,
only
for
her
good
clothe
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
look
a
bit
crazy
,
but
it
be
no
business
of
mine
.
<EOS>
I
stand
and
look
back
after
her
,
but
she
go
right
on
while
she
be
in
sight
.
<EOS>
I
have
to
go
to
the
other
side
of
the
coppice
to
look
after
some
stake
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
road
right
through
it
,
and
bit
of
opening
here
and
there
,
where
the
tree
have
be
cut
down
,
and
some
of
'em
not
carry
away
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
go
straight
along
the
road
,
but
turn
off
towards
the
middle
,
and
take
a
short
way
towards
the
spot
I
want
to
get
to
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
get
far
out
of
the
road
into
one
of
the
open
place
before
I
hear
a
strange
cry
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
do
not
come
from
any
animal
I
know
,
but
I
be
not
for
stop
to
look
about
just
then
.
<EOS>
but
it
go
on
,
and
seem
so
strange
to
me
in
that
place
,
I
could
not
help
stop
to
look
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
I
may
make
some
money
of
it
,
if
it
be
a
new
thing
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
hard
work
to
tell
which
way
it
come
from
,
and
for
a
good
while
I
keep
look
up
at
the
bough
.
<EOS>
and
then
I
think
it
come
from
the
ground
;
and
there
be
a
lot
of
timber
-
chopping
lie
about
,
and
loose
piece
of
turf
,
and
a
trunk
or
two
.
<EOS>
and
I
look
about
among
them
,
but
could
find
nothing
,
and
at
last
the
cry
stop
.
<EOS>
so
I
be
for
give
it
up
,
and
I
go
on
about
my
business
.
<EOS>
but
when
I
come
back
the
same
way
pretty
nigh
an
hour
after
,
I
could
not
help
lay
down
my
stake
to
have
another
look
.
<EOS>
and
just
as
I
be
stoop
and
lay
down
the
stake
,
I
see
something
odd
and
round
and
whitish
lie
on
the
ground
under
a
nut
-
bush
by
the
side
of
me
.
<EOS>
and
I
stoop
down
on
hand
and
knee
to
pick
it
up
.
<EOS>
and
I
see
it
be
a
little
baby
's
hand
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
these
word
a
thrill
run
through
the
court
.
<EOS>
Hetty
be
visibly
tremble
;
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
she
seem
to
be
listen
to
what
a
witness
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
lot
of
timber
-
chopping
put
together
just
where
the
ground
go
hollow
,
like
,
under
the
bush
,
and
the
hand
come
out
from
among
them
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
hole
leave
in
one
place
<EOS>
and
I
could
see
down
it
and
see
the
child
's
head
;
and
I
make
haste
and
do
away
the
turf
and
the
chopping
,
and
take
out
the
child
.
<EOS>
It
have
get
comfortable
clothe
on
,
but
its
body
be
cold
,
and
I
think
it
must
be
dead
.
<EOS>
I
make
haste
back
with
it
out
of
the
wood
,
and
take
it
home
to
my
wife
.
<EOS>
She
say
it
be
dead
,
and
I
would
better
take
it
to
the
parish
and
tell
the
constable
.
<EOS>
and
I
say
,
"
I
will
lay
my
life
<EOS>
it
be
that
young
woman
's
child
as
I
meet
go
to
the
coppice
.
<EOS>
"
but
she
seem
to
be
go
clean
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
and
I
take
the
child
on
to
Hetton
parish
and
tell
the
constable
,
and
we
go
on
to
Justice
Hardy
.
<EOS>
and
then
we
go
look
after
the
young
woman
till
dark
at
night
,
and
we
go
and
give
information
at
Stoniton
,
as
they
may
stop
her
.
<EOS>
and
the
next
morning
,
another
constable
come
to
me
,
to
go
with
him
to
the
spot
where
I
find
the
child
.
<EOS>
and
when
we
get
there
,
there
be
the
prisoner
a
-
sit
against
the
bush
where
I
find
the
child
;
and
she
cry
out
when
she
see
us
,
but
she
never
offer
to
move
.
<EOS>
She
would
get
a
big
piece
of
bread
on
her
lap
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
have
give
a
faint
groan
of
despair
while
this
witness
be
speak
.
<EOS>
He
have
hide
his
face
on
his
arm
,
which
rest
on
the
boarding
in
front
of
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
supreme
moment
of
his
suffering
:
<EOS>
Hetty
be
guilty
;
and
he
be
silently
call
to
God
for
help
.
<EOS>
He
hear
no
more
of
the
evidence
,
and
be
unconscious
when
the
case
for
the
prosecution
have
close
 
unconscious
that
Mr.
Irwine
be
in
the
witness
-
box
,
tell
of
Hetty
's
unblemished
character
in
her
own
parish
and
of
the
virtuous
habit
in
which
she
have
be
bring
up
.
<EOS>
this
testimony
could
have
no
influence
on
the
verdict
,
but
it
be
give
as
part
of
that
plea
for
mercy
which
her
own
counsel
would
have
make
if
he
have
be
allow
to
speak
for
her
 
a
favour
not
grant
to
criminal
in
those
stern
time
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
Adam
lift
up
his
head
,
for
there
be
a
general
movement
round
him
.
<EOS>
the
judge
have
address
the
jury
,
and
they
be
retire
.
<EOS>
the
decisive
moment
be
not
far
off
Adam
<EOS>
feel
a
shuddering
horror
that
would
not
let
him
look
at
Hetty
,
but
she
have
long
relapse
into
her
blank
hard
indifference
.
<EOS>
all
eye
be
strain
to
look
at
her
,
but
she
stand
like
a
statue
of
dull
despair
.
  
<EOS>
'
there
be
a
mingled
rustling
,
whisper
,
and
low
buzzing
throughout
the
court
during
this
interval
.
<EOS>
the
desire
to
listen
be
suspend
,
and
every
one
have
some
feeling
or
opinion
to
express
in
undertone
.
<EOS>
Adam
sit
look
blankly
before
him
,
but
he
do
not
see
the
object
that
be
right
in
front
of
his
eye
 
<EOS>
the
counsel
and
attorney
talk
with
an
air
of
cool
business
,
and
Mr.
Irwine
in
low
earnest
conversation
with
the
judge
 
do
not
see
Mr.
Irwine
sit
down
again
in
agitation
and
shake
his
head
mournfully
when
somebody
whisper
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
inward
action
be
too
intense
for
Adam
to
take
in
outward
object
until
some
strong
sensation
rouse
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
very
long
,
hardly
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
before
the
knock
which
tell
that
the
jury
have
come
to
their
decision
fall
as
a
signal
for
silence
on
every
ear
.
<EOS>
It
be
sublime
 
that
sudden
pause
of
a
great
multitude
which
tell
that
one
soul
move
in
them
all
.
<EOS>
deep
and
deep
the
silence
seem
to
become
,
like
the
deepen
night
,
while
the
jurymen
's
name
be
call
over
,
and
the
prisoner
be
make
to
hold
up
her
hand
,
and
the
jury
be
ask
for
their
verdict
.
  
<EOS>
"
guilty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
verdict
every
one
expect
,
but
there
be
a
sigh
of
disappointment
from
some
heart
that
it
be
follow
by
no
recommendation
to
mercy
.
<EOS>
still
the
sympathy
of
the
court
be
not
with
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
the
unnaturalness
of
her
crime
stand
out
the
more
harshly
by
the
side
of
her
hard
immovability
and
obstinate
silence
.
<EOS>
even
the
verdict
,
to
distant
eye
,
have
not
appear
to
move
her
,
but
those
who
be
near
see
her
trembling
.
  
<EOS>
the
stillness
be
less
intense
until
the
judge
put
on
his
black
cap
,
and
the
chaplain
in
his
canonical
be
observe
behind
him
.
<EOS>

the

as
she
look
up
at

keep
her
wide

open

fix
on
him

as

fascinate
by

<EOS>
Adam
have
not

turn
towards
her

there
be
a
deep
horror
,
like
a
great
gulf

between
them

but
at
the
word
"
and
then

hang
by

you

"
a

It
be
Hetty
's
shriek
.
<EOS>
Adam
start
to
his
foot

stretch
out
his

towards
her

<EOS>
but
the
arm
could
not

fall
down

Arthur
's
return
 
<EOS>
when
Arthur
Donnithorne
land
at
Liverpool
and
read
the
letter
from
his
Aunt
Lydia
,
briefly
announce
his
grand
-
father
's
death
,
his
first
feeling
be
,
"
Poor
Grandfather
!
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
have
get
to
him
to
be
with
him
when
he
die
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
feel
or
wish
something
at
the
last
that
I
shall
never
know
now
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
lonely
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
say
that
his
grief
be
deep
than
that
.
<EOS>
pity
and
softened
memory
take
place
of
the
old
antagonism
,
and
in
his
busy
thought
about
the
future
,
as
the
chaise
carry
him
rapidly
along
towards
the
home
where
he
be
now
to
be
master
,
there
be
a
continually
recur
effort
to
remember
anything
by
which
he
could
show
a
regard
for
his
grandfather
's
wish
,
without
counteract
his
own
cherished
aim
for
the
good
of
the
tenant
and
the
estate
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
in
human
nature
 
only
in
human
pretence
 
for
a
young
man
like
Arthur
,
with
a
fine
constitution
and
fine
spirit
,
think
well
of
himself
,
believe
that
other
think
well
of
him
,
and
have
a
very
ardent
intention
to
give
them
more
and
more
reason
for
that
good
opinion
 
it
be
not
possible
for
such
a
young
man
,
just
come
into
a
splendid
estate
through
the
death
of
a
very
old
man
whom
he
be
not
fond
of
,
to
feel
anything
very
different
from
exultant
joy
.
<EOS>
now
his
real
life
be
begin
;
now
he
would
have
room
and
opportunity
for
action
,
and
he
would
use
them
.
<EOS>
He
would
show
the
Loamshire
people
what
a
fine
country
gentleman
be
;
he
would
not
exchange
that
career
for
any
other
under
the
sun
.
<EOS>
He
feel
himself
ride
over
the
hill
in
the
breezy
autumn
day
,
look
after
favourite
plan
of
drainage
and
enclosure
;
then
admire
on
sombre
morning
as
the
good
rider
on
the
good
horse
in
the
hunt
;
speak
well
of
on
market
-
day
as
a
first
-
rate
landlord
;
by
and
by
make
speech
at
election
dinner
,
and
show
a
wonderful
knowledge
of
agriculture
;
the
patron
of
new
ploughs
and
drill
,
the
severe
upbraider
of
negligent
landowner
,
and
withal
a
jolly
fellow
that
everybody
must
like
 
happy
face
greet
him
everywhere
on
his
own
estate
,
and
the
neighbour
family
on
the
good
term
with
him
.
<EOS>
the
Irwines
should
dine
with
him
every
week
,
and
have
their
own
carriage
to
come
in
,
for
in
some
very
delicate
way
that
Arthur
would
devise
,
the
lay
-
impropriator
of
the
Hayslope
tithe
would
insist
on
pay
a
couple
of
hundred
more
to
the
vicar
;
and
his
aunt
should
be
as
comfortable
as
possible
,
and
go
on
live
at
the
Chase
,
if
she
like
,
in
spite
of
her
old
-
maidish
way
 
at
least
until
he
be
married
,
and
that
event
lie
in
the
indistinct
background
,
for
Arthur
have
not
yet
see
the
woman
who
would
play
the
lady
-
wife
to
the
first
-
rate
country
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
Arthur
's
chief
thought
,
so
far
as
a
man
's
thought
through
hour
of
travelling
can
be
compress
into
a
few
sentence
,
which
be
only
like
the
list
of
name
tell
you
what
be
the
scene
in
a
long
long
panorama
full
of
colour
,
of
detail
,
and
of
life
.
<EOS>
the
happy
face
Arthur
see
greet
him
be
not
pale
abstraction
,
but
real
ruddy
face
,
long
familiar
to
him
:
<EOS>
Martin
Poyser
be
there
 
the
whole
Poyser
family
.
  
<EOS>
what
 
<EOS>
Hetty
?
  
<EOS>
yes
;
for
Arthur
be
at
ease
about
Hetty
 
not
quite
at
ease
about
the
past
,
for
a
certain
burning
of
the
ear
<EOS>
would
come
whenever
he
think
of
the
scene
with
Adam
last
August
,
but
at
ease
about
her
present
lot
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
,
who
have
be
a
regular
correspondent
,
tell
him
all
the
news
about
the
old
place
and
people
,
have
send
him
word
nearly
three
month
ago
that
Adam
Bede
be
not
to
marry
Mary
Burge
,
as
he
have
think
,
but
pretty
Hetty
Sorrel
.
<EOS>
Martin
Poyser
and
Adam
himself
have
both
tell
Mr.
Irwine
all
about
it
 
that
Adam
have
be
deeply
in
love
with
Hetty
these
two
year
,
and
that
now
it
be
agree
they
be
to
be
marry
in
March
.
<EOS>
that
stalwart
rogue
Adam
be
more
susceptible
than
the
rector
have
think
;
it
be
really
quite
an
idyllic
love
affair
;
and
if
it
have
not
be
too
long
to
tell
in
a
letter
,
he
would
have
like
to
describe
to
Arthur
the
blush
look
and
the
simple
strong
word
with
which
the
fine
honest
fellow
tell
his
secret
.
<EOS>
He
know
Arthur
would
like
to
hear
that
Adam
have
this
sort
of
happiness
in
prospect
.
  
<EOS>
yes
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
Arthur
feel
there
be
not
air
enough
in
the
room
to
satisfy
his
renovated
life
,
when
he
have
read
that
passage
in
the
letter
.
<EOS>
He
throw
up
the
window
,
he
rush
out
of
door
into
the
December
air
,
and
greet
every
one
who
speak
to
him
with
an
eager
gaiety
,
as
if
there
have
be
news
of
a
fresh
Nelson
victory
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
that
day
since
he
have
come
to
Windsor
,
he
be
in
true
boyish
spirit
.
<EOS>
the
load
that
have
be
press
upon
him
be
go
,
the
haunting
fear
have
vanish
.
<EOS>
He
think
he
could
conquer
his
bitterness
towards
Adam
now
 
could
offer
him
his
hand
,
and
ask
to
be
his
friend
again
,
in
spite
of
that
painful
memory
which
would
still
make
his
ear
burn
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
knock
down
,
and
he
have
be
force
to
tell
a
lie
:
such
thing
make
a
scar
,
do
what
we
will
.
<EOS>
but
if
Adam
be
the
same
again
as
in
the
old
day
,
Arthur
wish
to
be
the
same
too
,
and
to
have
Adam
mix
up
with
his
business
and
his
future
,
as
he
have
always
desire
before
the
accurse
meeting
in
August
.
<EOS>
nay
,
he
would
do
a
great
deal
more
for
Adam
than
he
should
otherwise
have
do
,
when
he
come
into
the
estate
;
Hetty
's
husband
have
a
special
claim
on
him
 
<EOS>
Hetty
herself
should
feel
that
any
pain
she
have
suffer
through
Arthur
in
the
past
be
compensate
to
her
a
hundredfold
.
<EOS>
for
really
she
could
not
have
feel
much
,
since
she
have
so
soon
make
up
her
mind
to
marry
Adam
.
  
<EOS>
You
perceive
clearly
what
sort
of
picture
Adam
and
Hetty
make
in
the
panorama
of
Arthur
's
thought
on
his
journey
homeward
.
<EOS>
It
be
March
now
;
they
be
soon
to
be
marry
:
perhaps
they
be
already
married
.
<EOS>
and
now
it
be
actually
in
his
power
to
do
a
great
deal
for
them
.
<EOS>
sweet
 
sweet
little
Hetty
!
<EOS>
the
little
puss
have
not
care
for
him
half
as
much
as
he
care
for
her
;
for
he
be
a
great
fool
about
her
<EOS>
still
 
be
almost
afraid
of
see
her
 
indeed
,
have
not
care
much
to
look
at
any
other
woman
since
he
part
from
her
.
<EOS>
that
little
figure
come
towards
him
in
the
Grove
,
those
dark
-
fringed
childish
eye
,
the
lovely
lip
put
up
to
kiss
him
 
that
picture
have
get
no
fainter
with
the
lapse
of
month
.
<EOS>
and
she
would
look
just
the
same
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
think
how
he
could
meet
her
:
he
should
certainly
tremble
.
<EOS>
strange
,
how
long
this
sort
of
influence
last
,
for
he
be
certainly
not
in
love
with
Hetty
now
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
earnestly
desire
,
for
month
,
that
she
should
marry
Adam
,
and
there
be
nothing
that
contribute
more
to
his
happiness
in
these
moment
than
the
thought
of
their
marriage
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
exaggerate
effect
of
imagination
that
make
his
heart
still
beat
a
little
more
quickly
at
the
thought
of
her
.
<EOS>
when
he
see
the
little
thing
again
as
she
really
be
,
as
Adam
's
wife
,
at
work
quite
prosaically
in
her
new
home
,
he
should
perhaps
wonder
at
the
possibility
of
his
past
feeling
.
<EOS>
thank
heaven
it
have
turn
out
so
well
!
<EOS>
He
should
have
plenty
of
affair
and
interest
to
fill
his
life
now
,
and
not
be
in
danger
of
play
the
fool
again
.
  
<EOS>
pleasant
<EOS>
the
crack
of
the
post
-
boy
's
whip
!
<EOS>
pleasant
the
sense
of
be
hurry
along
in
swift
ease
through
english
scene
,
so
like
those
round
his
own
home
,
only
not
quite
so
charming
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
market
-
town
 
very
much
like
Treddleston
 
where
the
arm
of
the
neighbouring
lord
of
the
manor
be
bear
on
the
sign
of
the
principal
inn
;
then
mere
field
and
hedge
,
their
vicinity
to
a
market
-
town
carry
an
agreeable
suggestion
of
high
rent
,
till
the
land
begin
to
assume
a
trimmer
look
,
the
wood
be
more
frequent
,
and
at
length
a
white
or
red
mansion
look
down
from
a
moderate
eminence
,
or
allow
him
to
be
aware
of
its
parapet
and
chimney
among
the
dense
-
look
masse
of
oak
and
elm
 
<EOS>
masse
redden
now
with
early
bud
.
<EOS>
and
close
at
hand
come
the
village
:
the
small
church
,
with
its
red
-
tile
roof
,
look
humble
even
among
the
fade
half
-
timbered
house
;
the
old
green
gravestone
with
nettle
round
them
;
nothing
fresh
and
bright
but
the
child
,
open
round
eye
at
the
swift
post
-
chaise
;
nothing
noisy
and
busy
but
the
gape
cur
of
mysterious
pedigree
.
<EOS>
what
a
much
pretty
village
Hayslope
be
!
<EOS>
and
it
should
not
be
neglect
like
this
place
:
vigorous
repair
should
go
on
everywhere
among
farm
-
building
and
cottage
,
and
traveller
in
post
-
chaise
,
come
along
the
Rosseter
road
,
should
do
nothing
but
admire
as
they
go
.
<EOS>
and
Adam
Bede
should
superintend
all
the
repair
,
for
he
have
a
share
in
Burge
's
business
now
,
and
,
if
he
like
,
Arthur
would
put
some
money
into
the
concern
and
buy
the
old
man
out
in
another
year
or
two
.
<EOS>
that
be
an
ugly
fault
in
Arthur
's
life
,
that
affair
last
summer
,
but
the
future
should
make
amend
.
<EOS>
many
man
would
have
retain
a
feeling
of
vindictiveness
towards
Adam
,
but
he
would
not
 
he
would
resolutely
overcome
all
littleness
of
that
kind
,
for
he
have
certainly
be
very
much
in
the
wrong
;
and
though
Adam
have
be
harsh
and
violent
,
and
have
thrust
on
him
a
painful
dilemma
,
the
poor
fellow
be
in
love
,
and
have
real
provocation
.
<EOS>
no
,
Arthur
have
not
an
evil
feeling
in
his
mind
towards
any
human
being
:
he
be
happy
,
and
would
make
every
one
else
happy
that
come
within
his
reach
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
be
dear
old
Hayslope
at
last
,
sleep
,
on
the
hill
,
like
a
quiet
old
place
as
it
be
,
in
the
late
afternoon
sunlight
,
and
opposite
to
it
the
great
shoulder
of
the
Binton
Hills
,
below
them
the
purplish
blackness
of
the
hang
wood
,
and
at
last
the
pale
front
of
the
Abbey
,
look
out
from
among
the
oak
of
the
Chase
,
as
if
anxious
for
the
heir
's
return
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
Grandfather

<EOS>
and
he

dead
there

<EOS>
He

once

come
into
the

and
make
his
plan

<EOS>
so
the
world
go
round
!
<EOS>
Aunt
Lydia
must
feel
very
desolate
,
poor
thing
;
but
she
shall
be
indulge
as
much
as
she
indulge
her
fat
Fido

"
  
<EOS>
the
wheel
of
Arthur
's
chaise
have
be
anxiously
listen
for
at
the
Chase
,
for
to

day
be
Friday
,
and
the
funeral
have
already
be
defer
two
day
.
<EOS>
before
it
draw
up
on
the
gravel
of
the
courtyard
,
all
the
servant
in
the
house
be
assemble
to
receive
him
with
a
grave
,
decent
welcome
,
befit
a
house
of
death
.
<EOS>
a
month
ago
,
perhaps
,
it
would
have
be
difficult
for
them
to
have
maintain
a
suitable
sadness
in
their
face
,
when
Mr.
Arthur
be
come
to
take
possession
;
but
the
heart
of
the
head
-
servant
be
heavy
that
day
for
another
cause
than
the
death
of
the
old
squire
,
and
more
than
one
of
them
be
long
to
be
twenty
mile
away
,
as
Mr.
Craig
be
,
know
what
be
to
become
of
Hetty
Sorrel
 
pretty
Hetty
Sorrel
 
whom
they
use
to
see
every
week
.
<EOS>
They
have
the
partisanship
of
household
servant
who
like
their
place
,
and
be
not
inclined
to
go
the
full
length
of
the
severe
indignation
feel
against
him
by
the
farming
tenant
,
but
rather
to
make
excuse
for
him
;
nevertheless
,
the
upper
servant
,
who
have
be
on
term
of
neighbourly
intercourse
with
the
Poysers
for
many
year
,
could
not
help
feel
that
the
long
-
for
event
of
the
young
squire
be
come
into
the
estate
have
be
rob
of
all
its
pleasantness
.
  
<EOS>
to
Arthur
it
be
nothing
surprising
that
the
servant
look
grave
and
sad
:
he
himself
be
very
much
touch
on
see
them
all
again
,
and
feel
that
he
be
in
a
new
relation
to
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
that
sort
of
pathetic
emotion
which
have
more
pleasure
than
pain
in
it
 
which
be
perhaps
one
of
the
most
delicious
of
all
state
to
a
good
-
natured

His
heart
swell
agreeably
as
he
say
,
"
well
,
Mills
,
how
be
my
aunt

"
  
<EOS>
but
now
Mr.
Bygate
,
the
lawyer
,
who
have
be
in
the
house
ever
since
the
death

come
forward
to
give
deferential
greeting
and
answer
all
question
,
and
Arthur

with
him
towards
the
library
,
where
his
Aunt
Lydia
be
expect
him
.
<EOS>
Aunt
Lydia
be
the
only
person
in
the
house
who
know
nothing
about
Hetty
.
<EOS>
Her
sorrow
as
a
maiden
daughter
be
unmixed
with
any
other
thought
than
those
of
anxiety
about
funeral
arrangement
and
her
own
future
lot
;
and
,
after
the
manner
of
woman
,
she
mourn
for
the
father
who
have
make
her
life
important
,
all
the
more
because
she
have
a
secret
sense
that
there
be
little
mourning
for
him
in
other
heart
.
  
<EOS>
but
Arthur
kiss
her
tearful
face
more
tenderly
than
he
have
ever
do
in
his
life
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
dear
Aunt
,
"
he
say
affectionately
,
as
he
hold
her
hand
,
"

but

all
the
rest
of
your

It

so
sudden
and
so
dreadful

Arthur

"
poor
Miss
Lydia
begin
,
pour
out
her
little
plaint
,
and
Arthur
sit
down
to
listen
with
impatient
patience
.
<EOS>
when
a
pause
come
,
he
say
:
  
"
now
,
Aunt
,
I
will
leave
you
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
just

full
attention

<EOS>
"
My
room

all
ready
for
me

I
suppose

Mills

<EOS>
"
he
say
to
the
butler
,
who
seem
to
be
linger
uneasily
about
the
entrance
-
hall
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
and
there
be
letter
for
you

they

"
  
<EOS>
on
enter
the
small
anteroom
which
be
call
a
dressing
-
room
,
but
which
Arthur
really
use
only
to
lounge
and
write
in
,
he
just
cast
his
eye
on
the
writing
-
table
,
and
see
that
there
be
several
letter
and
packet
lie
there
;
but
he
be
in
the
uncomfortable
dusty
condition
of
a
man
who
have
have
a
long
hurried
journey
,
and
he
must
really
refresh
himself
by
attend
to
his
toilette
a
little
,
before
he
read
his
letter
.
<EOS>
Pym
be
there
,
make
everything
ready
for
him
,
and
soon
,
with
a
delightful
freshness
about
him
,
as
if
he
be
prepared
to
begin
a
new
day
,
he
go
back
into
his
dressing
-
room
to
open
his
letter
.
<EOS>
the
level
ray
of
the
low
afternoon
sun
enter
directly
at
the
window
,
and
as
Arthur
seat
himself
in
his
velvet
chair
with
their
pleasant
warmth
upon
him
,
he
be
conscious
of
that
quiet
well
-
being
which
perhaps
you
and
I
have
feel
on
a
sunny
afternoon
when
,
in
our
bright
youth
and
health
,
life
have
open
a
new
vista
for
us
,
and
long
to
-
morrow
of
activity
have
stretch
before
us
like
a
lovely
plain
which
there
be
no
need
for
hurrying
to
look
at
,
because
it
be
all
our
own
.
  
<EOS>
the
top
letter
be
place
with
its

upwards
:

see
at
once
;
and
below
the
address
be
write
,
"
to
be
deliver
as
soon
as
he
arrive
.
<EOS>
"
nothing
could
have
be
less
surprising
to
him
than
a
letter
from
Mr.
Irwine
at
that
moment
:
of
course
,
there
be
something
he
wish
Arthur
to
know
earlier
than
it
be
possible
for
them
to
see
each
other
.
<EOS>
at
such
a
time
as
that
it
be
quite
natural
that
Irwine
should
have
something
press
to
say
.
<EOS>
Arthur
break
the
seal
with
an
agreeable
anticipation
of
soon
see
the
writer
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
send
this
letter

the
most
painful
duty

"
I
will
not

add
by
one
word
of
reproach
to
the
retribution
that

on
you
:
any
other
word
that
I
could
write
at
this
moment
must
be
weak
and
unmeaning
by
the
side
of
those
in
which
I
must
tell
you
the
simple
fact

<EOS>
Arthur
read
no
more

<EOS>
He
start
up
from
his
chair
and
stand
for
a
single
minute
with
a
sense
of
violent
convulsion
in
his
whole
frame
,
as
if
the
life
be
go
out
of
him
with
horrible
throbs
;
but
the
next
minute

out
along

<EOS>
the

out
after

at
that

catch

of

<EOS>
"

Dinah
mechanically
take
off
her
bonnet
and
shawl
as
soon
as
they
be
within
the
prison
court
,
from
the
habit
she
have
of
throw
them
off
when
she
preach
or
pray
,
or
visit
the
sick
;
and
when
they
enter
the
jailer

room
,
she
lay
them
down
on
a
chair
unthinkingly
.
<EOS>
there

calmness

as
Dinah
cross
the
prison
court
with
the
turnkey
,
the
solemn
evening
light
seem
to
make
the
wall
high
than
they
be
by
day
,
and
the
sweet
pale
face
in
the
cap
be
more
than
ever
like
a
white
flower
on
this
background
of
gloom
.
<EOS>
the
turnkey
look
askance
at
her
all
the
while
,
but
never
speak
.
<EOS>
He
somehow
feel
that
the
sound
of
his
own
rude
voice
would
be
grate
just
then
.
<EOS>
He
strike
a
light
as
they
enter
the
dark
corridor
lead
to
the
condemn
cell
,
and
then
say
in
his
most
civil
tone
,
"
It
will
be
pretty
nigh
dark
in
the
cell
a'ready

but
I
can
stop
with
my
light

"
Nay

"
I

in
alone

<EOS>
"
as
you
like

say
the
jailer
,
turn
the
harsh
key
in
the
lock
and
open
the
door
wide
enough
to
admit
Dinah
.
<EOS>
a
jet
of
light
from
his
lantern
fall
on
the
opposite
corner
of
the
cell
,
where
Hetty
be
sit
on
her
straw
pallet
with
her
face
bury
in
her
knee
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
she
be
asleep
,
and
yet
the
grating
of
the
lock
would
have
be
likely
to
waken
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
door
close
again
,
and
the
only
light
in
the
cell
be
that
of
the
evening
sky
,
through
the
small
high
grating
 
enough
to
discern
human
face
by
.
<EOS>
Dinah
stand
still
for
a
minute
,
hesitate
to
speak
because
Hetty
may
be
asleep
,
and
look
at
the
motionless
heap
with
a
yearn
heart
.
<EOS>
then
she
say
,
softly
,
"
Hetty
!
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
slight
movement
perceptible
in
Hetty
's
frame
 
<EOS>
a
start
such
as
may
have
be
produce
by
a
feeble
electrical
shock
 
but
she
do
not
look
up
.
<EOS>
Dinah
speak
again
,
in
a
tone
make
strong
by
irrepressible
emotion
,
"
Hetty
...
<EOS>
it
be
Dinah
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
again
there
be
a
slight
startled
movement
through
Hetty
's
frame
,
and
without
uncover
her
face
,
she
raise
her
head
a
little
,
as
if
listen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hetty
...
<EOS>
Dinah
be
come
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
Hetty
lift
her
head
slowly
and
timidly
from
her
knee
and
raise
her
eye
.
<EOS>
the
two
pale
face
be
look
at
each
other
:
one
with
a
wild
hard
despair
in
it
,
the
other
full
of
sad
yearning
love
.
<EOS>
Dinah
unconsciously
open
her
arm
and
stretch
them
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
know
me
,
Hetty
?
<EOS>
do
not
you
remember
Dinah
?
<EOS>
do
you
think
I
would
not
come
to
you
in
trouble
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
keep
her
eye
fix
on
Dinah
's
face
 
at
first
like
an
animal
that
gaze
,
and
gaze
,
and
keep
aloof
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
come
to
be
with
you
,
Hetty
 
not
to
leave
you
 
to
stay
with
you
 
to
be
your
sister
to
the
last

"
  
<EOS>
slowly
,
while
Dinah
be
speak
,
Hetty
rise
,
take
a
step
forward
,
and
be
clasp
in
Dinah
's
arm
.
  
<EOS>
They
stand
so
a
long
while
,
for
neither
of
them
feel
the
impulse
to
move
apart
again
.
<EOS>
Hetty
,
without
any
distinct
thought
of
it
,
hang
on
this
something
that
be
come
to
clasp
her
now
,
while
she
be
sink
helpless
in
a
dark
gulf
;
and
Dinah
feel
a
deep
joy
in
the
first
sign
that
her
love
be
welcome
by
the
wretched
lose
one
.
<EOS>
the
light
get
faint
as
they
stand
,
and
when
at
last
they
sit
down
on
the
straw
pallet
together
,
their
face
have
become
indistinct
.
  
<EOS>
not
a
word
be
speak
.
<EOS>
Dinah
wait
,
hope
for
a
spontaneous
word
from
Hetty
,
but
she
sit
in
the
same
dull
despair
,
only
clutch
the
hand
that
hold
hers
and
lean
her
cheek
against
Dinah
's
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
human
contact
she
cling
to
,
but
she
be
not
the
less
sinking
into
the
dark
gulf
.
  
<EOS>
Dinah
begin
to
doubt
whether
Hetty
be
conscious
who
it
be
that
sit
beside
her
.
<EOS>
She
think
suffering
and
fear
may
have
drive
the
poor
sinner
out
of
her
mind
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
bear
in
upon
her
,
as
she
afterwards
say
,
that
she
must
not
hurry
God
's
work
:
we
be
overhasty
to
speak
 
as
if
God
do
not
manifest
himself
by
our
silent
feeling
,
and
make
his
love
feel
through
ours
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
know
how
long
they
sit
in
that
way
,
but
it
get
dark
and
darker
,
till
there
be
only
a
pale
patch
of
light
on
the
opposite
wall
:
all
the
rest
be
darkness
.
<EOS>
but
she
feel
the
Divine
presence
more
and
more
 
nay
,
as
if
she
herself
be
a
part
of
it
,
and
it
be
the
divine
pity
that
be
beat
in
her
heart
and
be
willing
the
rescue
of
this
helpless
one
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
be
prompt
to
speak
and
find
out
how
far
Hetty
be
conscious
of
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hetty
,
"
she
say
gently
,
"
do
you
know
who
it
be
that
sit
by
your
side
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
Hetty
answer
slowly
,
"
it
be
Dinah

"
  
"
and
do
you
remember
the
time
when
we
be
at
the
Hall
Farm
together
,
and
that
night
when
I
tell
you
to
be
sure
and
think
of
me
as
a
friend
in
trouble
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Hetty
.
<EOS>
then
,
after
a
pause
,
she
add
,
"
<EOS>
but
you
can
do
nothing
for
me

<EOS>
You
can
not

They
will
hang
me

Monday

be
Friday

<EOS>
as
Hetty
say
the
last
word
,
she
cling
closer
to
Dinah
,
shudder
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Hetty
,
I
can
not

you

You

Hetty

I

<EOS>
I
will
stay
with
you
to
the

<EOS>
but
,
Hetty
,
there
be
some
one
else
in
this
cell
besides
me
,
some
one
close
to
you

<EOS>
Hetty
say
,
in
a
frightened
whisper
,
"
who

"
  
<EOS>
"
some
one

and
on
Monday

when
I
can
not

It

it

very
miserable

drown
myself

bear
to
look

they
would
have
scorn
me

I
think
o

you
sometimes

think
I
would
come
to
you

I
do
not

cross
with
me

cry
shame
on

I
could
tell
you

then
the
other
folk

come
to
know
it
at
last

I
could
not
bear
that

It
be
partly
think
o

'
you
make
me
come
toward
Stoniton

,
besides

I
be
so
frightened
at
go
wander
about

I
be
a
beggar

woman

have
nothing

sometimes
it
seem
as

I
must
go
back

that

oh
,
it
be
so
dreadful

miserable

never

pause
again
,
as
if
the
sense
of
the
past
be
too
strong
upon
her
for
word

"
and
then
I
get
to
Stoniton
,

I
begin
to
feel
frightened
that
night

because
I
be
so
near
home

then
the
little
baby
be
bear
,
when
I
do
not
expect
it

the
thought
come
into
my
mind

I
may
get
rid
of
it

go
home
again

the
thought
come
all

sudden

I
be
lie
in

it
get
strong

strong

I
long
so

I
could
not

be
so
lonely

come

beg
for

it
give
me
strength

resolution

get
up

dress
myself

I
feel

must
do
it
...
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
<EOS>
how
...
<EOS>
I
think
I
would
find
a
pool
,
if
I
could
,
like
that
other
,
in
the
corner
of
the
field
,
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
and
when
the
woman
go
out
,
I
feel
as
if
I
be
strong
enough
to
do
anything
...
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
get
rid
of
all
my
misery
,
and
go
back
home
,
and
never
let
'em
know
why
I
run
away
<EOS>
I
put
on
my
bonnet
and
shawl
,
and
go
out
into
the
dark
street
,
with
the
baby
under
my
cloak
;
and
I
walk
fast
till
I
get
into
a
street
a
good
way
off
,
and
there
be
a
public
,
and
I
get
some
warm
stuff
to
drink
and
some
bread
.
<EOS>
and
I
walk
on
and
on
,
and
I
hardly
feel
the
ground
I
tread
on
;
and
it
get
light
,
<EOS>
for
there
come
the
moon
 
<EOS>
oh
,
Dinah
,
it
frighten
me
when
it
first
look
at
me
out
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
the
cloud
 
<EOS>
it
never
look
so
before
;
and
I
turn
out
of
the
road
into
the
field
,
for
I
be
afraid
<EOS>
o
'
meeting
anybody
with
the
moon
shine
on
me
.
<EOS>
and
I
come
to
a
haystack
,
where
I
think
I
could
lie
down
and
keep
myself
warm
all
night
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
place
cut
into
it
,
where
I
could
make
me
a
bed
,
and
I
lay
comfortable
,
and
the
baby
be
warm
against
me
;
and
I
must
have
go
to
sleep
for
a
good
while
,
for
when
I
wake
it
be
morning
,
but
not
very
light
,
and
the
baby
be
cry
.
<EOS>
and
I
see
a
wood
a
little
way
off
...
<EOS>
I
think
there
'd
perhaps
be
a
ditch
or
a
pond
there
...
and
it
be
<EOS>
so
early
I
think
I
could
hide
the
child
there
,
and
get
a
long
way
off
before
folk
be
up
.
<EOS>
and
then
I
think
I
would
go
home
 
<EOS>
I
would
get
ride
in
cart
and
go
home
and
tell
'em
<EOS>
I
would
be
to
try
and
see
for
a
place
,
and
could
not
get
one
.
<EOS>
I
long
so
for
it
,
<EOS>
Dinah
,
I
long
so
to
be
safe
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
I
feel
about
the
baby
.
<EOS>
I
seem
to
hate
it
 
<EOS>
it
be
like
a
heavy
weight
hang
round
my
neck
;
and
yet
its
crying
go
through
me
,
and
<EOS>
I
daredn't
look
at
its
little
hand
and
face
.
<EOS>
but
I
go
on
to
the
wood
,
and
I
walk
about
,
but
there
be
no
water
....
<EOS>
"
  
Hetty
shudder
.
<EOS>
She
be
silent
for
some
moment
,
and
when
she
begin
again
,
it
be
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
come
to
a
place
where
there
be
lot
of
chip
and
turf
,
and
I
sit
down
on
the
trunk
of
a
tree
to
think
what
I
should
do
.
<EOS>
and
all
of
a
sudden
I
see
a
hole
under
the
nut
-
tree
,
like
a
little
grave
.
<EOS>
and
it
dart
into
me
like
lightne
 
<EOS>
I
would
lay
the
baby
there
and
cover
it
with
the
grass
and
the
chip
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
kill
it
any
other
way
.
<EOS>
and
I
would
do
it
in
a
minute
;
and
,
oh
,
it
cry
so
,
Dinah
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
cover
it
quite
up
 
<EOS>
I
think
perhaps
<EOS>
somebody
'
ud
come
and
take
care
of
it
,
and
then
it
would
not
die
.
<EOS>
and
I
make
haste
out
of
the
wood
,
but
I
could
hear
it
cry
all
the
while
;
and
when
I
get
out
into
the
field
,
it
be
as
if
I
be
hold
fast
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
go
away
,
for
all
I
want
so
to
go
.
<EOS>
and
I
sit
against
the
haystack
to
watch
if
anybody
'
ud
come
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
hungry
,
and
I
would
only
a
bit
of
bread
leave
,
but
I
could
not
go
away
.
<EOS>
and
after
ever
such
a
while
 
hour
and
hour
 
the
man
come
 
him
in
a
smock
-
frock
,
and
he
look
at
me
<EOS>
so
,
I
be
frightened
,
and
I
make
haste
and
go
on
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
be
go
to
the
wood
and
would
perhaps
find
the
baby
.
<EOS>
and
I
go
right
on
,
till
I
come
to
a
village
,
a
long
way
off
from
the
wood
,
and
I
be
very
sick
,
and
faint
,
and
hungry
.
<EOS>
I
get
something
to
eat
there
,
and
buy
a
loaf
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
frightened
to
stay
.
<EOS>
I
hear
the
baby
cry
,
and
think
the
other
folk
hear
it
too
 
<EOS>
and
I
go
on
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
so
tired
,
and
it
be
get
towards
dark
.
<EOS>
and
at
last
,
by
the
roadside
there
be
a
barn
 
ever
such
a
way
off
any
house
 
like
the
barn
in
Abbot
's
close
,
and
I
think
I
could
go
in
there
and
hide
myself
among
the
hay
and
straw
,
and
nobody
'
ud
be
likely
to
come
.
<EOS>
I
go
in
,
and
it
be
half
full
o
'
truss
of
straw
,
and
there
be
some
hay
too
.
<EOS>
and
I
make
myself
a
bed
,
ever
so
far
behind
,
where
nobody
could
find
me
;
and
I
be
so
tired
and
weak
<EOS>
,
I
go
to
sleep
....
<EOS>
but
oh
,
the
baby
's
crying
keep
wake
me
,
and
I
think
that
man
as
look
at
me
so
be
come
and
lay
hold
of
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
have
sleep
a
long
while
at
last
,
though
I
do
not
know
,
for
when
I
get
up
and
go
out
of
the
barn
,
I
do
not
know
whether
it
be
night
or
morning
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
morning
,
for
it
keep
get
light
,
and
I
turn
back
the
way
I
would
come
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
it
,
Dinah
;
it
be
the
baby
's
crying
make
me
go
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
be
frightened
to
death
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
man
in
the
smock
-
frock
'
ud
see
me
and
know
I
put
the
baby
there
.
<EOS>
but
I
go
on
,
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
I
would
leave
off
think
about
go
home
 
<EOS>
it
have
go
out
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
see
nothing
but
that
place
in
the
wood
where
I
would
bury
the
baby
...
<EOS>
I
see
it
now
.
<EOS>
oh
Dinah

"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
clung
round
Dinah
and
shudder
again
.
<EOS>
the
silence
seem
long
before
she
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
meet
nobody
,
for
it
be
very
early
,
and
I
get
into
the
wood

<EOS>
I
know
the
way
to
the
place

<EOS>
the
place
against
the
nut

I
could
hear
it
cry
at
every
step

I
do

I
do
not

<EOS>
I
only
know
I
be
in

hear
the
cry

I
do
not

what
I
feel
till
I
see
the
baby
be
go

<EOS>
and
when
I
would
put
it
there
,
I
think
I
should
like
somebody
to
find
it
and
save
it
from
die

but
when
I
see
it
be
go

I
be
strike
like

with
fear

I
never

My

as
if
there

and

for

so
full

at

Hetty
burst
out

with

Adam
never

to

that
night

<EOS>
the
excitement
of
suspense

heighten
with
every
hour
that
bring
him
nearer
the
fatal
moment
,
be
too
great
,
and
in

of
his
entreaty
,
in

of
his
promise
that
he
would
be
perfectly
quiet

"
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
and
dreary
night
in
that
small
chamber
.
<EOS>
Adam
would
sometimes
get
up
and
tread
backwards
and
forwards
along
the
short
space
from
wall
to
wall
;
then
he
would
sit
down
and
hide
his
face
,
and
no
sound
would
be
hear
but
the
ticking
of
the
watch
on
the
table
,
or
the
falling
of
a
cinder
from
the
fire
which
the
schoolmaster
carefully
tend
.
<EOS>
sometimes
he
would
burst
out
into
vehement
speech
,
"
if
I
could
ha

do
anything
to
save
her
 
if
my

<EOS>

t

have
to

still

Bartle
tenderly
,

it

heavy
 
<EOS>

heavy

<EOS>
but
you
must
remember
this
:
when

you
would
a
notion
she
would
get
another
sort
of

nature
inside
her

You
do
not

get
harden

<EOS>
"
I

I

would
not

deceitful

<EOS>
how
could
I
think
any

if

I

there

bad
for

to
bear
now
:
you

<EOS>
you

<EOS>
but
I
have
that
opinion

you
will
rise
above

be
a

there

They

"

Bartle

<EOS>
in
a
gentle
tone

strangely
in
contrast
with
his
usual
peremptoriness

impatience
of
contradiction
,
"
it
be
likely
enough
I
talk
foolishness

I

Mr.

half
an

"
the

It

Dinah

Hetty

<EOS>
He
could
not

for
agitation
deaden
his
sense

and
the
dim
cell
be
almost
dark
to
him

<EOS>
He
stand
a
moment
after
the
door
close
behind
him
,
tremble
and
stupefy
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
begin
to
see
through
the
dimness
 
to
see
the
dark
eye
lift
up
to
him
once
more
,
but
with
no
smile
in
them

<EOS>
o
God

<EOS>
the
last
time
they
have
meet
his

when
he
part
from
her
with
his
heart
full
of
joyous
hopeful
love
,
and
they
look
out
with
a
tearful
smile
from
a
pink
,
dimpled
,
childish
face

<EOS>
the
face
be
marble
now
;
the
sweet
lip
be
pallid

half

open
and
quiver

the
dimple

all

that

and
the
eye
 
o

<EOS>
the
bad
of
all
be
the
likeness
they
have
to
Hetty

<EOS>
They
be
Hetty

eye
look
at
him
with
that
mournful
gaze

She

hope
lie
in

shine
out
from

with
fresh
fear

<EOS>
It
be
the
first
time
she
have
see
any
be
whose
face
seem
to
reflect
the
change
in
herself
:
<EOS>
Adam
be
a
new
image
of
the
dreadful
past
and
the
dreadful
present

She
tremble
more

It

Adam
as
if
his
brain
would
burst
with
the
anguish
of
meet
Hetty

eye
in
the
first
moment

but
the
sound
of
her
voice
utter
these
penitent
word
touch
a
chord
which
have
be
less
strained

<EOS>
there

not
leave

except
to
go
to
the
family
at
the
Hall
Farm
and
tell
them
everything
that
Mr.
Irwine
have
leave
untold
.
<EOS>
He
have
agree
with
the
Poysers
that
he
would
follow
them
to
their
new
neighbourhood
,
wherever
that
may
be
,
for
he
mean
to
give
up
the
management
of
the
wood
,
and
,
as
soon
as
it
be
practicable
,
he
would
wind
up
his
business
with
Jonathan
Burge
and
settle
with
his
mother
and
Seth
in
a
home
within
reach
of
the

he
feel
bind
by
a
mutual
sorrow

"
Seth

My

will
not
stand
in
the
way

for
she
be
tell
me

since
I
come

she

make
up
her

<EOS>
that
be
a
long
visit
to
the
Hall

draw
too
strongly
on
Adam

energy

of

"
  
<EOS>
this
evening
be
the
last
he
would
allow
to
be
absorb
by
sorrow
:
<EOS>
suspense
be
go
now
,
and
he
must
bear
the
unalterable
.
<EOS>
He
be
resolve
not
to
see
Arthur
Donnithorne
again
,
if
it
be
possible
to
avoid
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
message
to
deliver
from
Hetty
now
,
for
Hetty
have
see
Arthur
.
<EOS>
and
Adam
distrust
himself
 
he
have
learn
to
dread
the
violence
of
his
own
feeling
.
<EOS>
that
word
of
Mr.
Irwine
's
 
that
he
must
remember
what
he
have
feel
after
give
the
last
blow
to
Arthur
in
the
Grove
 
have
remain
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
these
thought
about
Arthur
,
like
all
thought
that
be
charge
with
strong
feeling
,
be
continually
recur
,
and
they
always
call
up
the
image
of
the
Grove
 
of
that
spot
under
the
overarch
bough
where
he
have
catch
sight
of
the
two
bend
figure
,
and
have
be
possess
by
sudden
rage
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
and
see
it
again
to

night
for
the
last
time

,
"
he
say
;
"
it
will
do
me
good
;
it
will
make
me
feel
over
again
what
I
feel
when
I
would
knock
him
down
.
<EOS>
I
feel
what
poor
empty
work
it
be
,
as
soon
as
I
would
do
it
,
before
I
begin
to
think
he
may
be
dead
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
this
way
it
happen
that
Arthur
and
Adam
be
walk
towards
the
same
spot
at
the
same
time
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
have
on
his
working
-
dress
again
,
now
,
for
he
have
throw
off
the
other
with
a
sense
of
relief
as
soon
as
he
come
home
;
and
if
he
have
have
the
basket
of
tool
over
his
shoulder
,
he
may
have
be
take
,
with
his
pale
waste
face
,
for
the
spectre
of
the
Adam
Bede
who
enter
the
Grove
on
that
August
evening
eight
month
ago
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
no
basket
of
tool
,
and
he
be
not
walk
with
the
old
erectness
,
look
<EOS>
keenly
round
him
;
his
hand
be
thrust
in
his
side
pocket
,
and
his
eye
rest
chiefly
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
long
enter
the
Grove
,
and
now
he
pause
before
a
beech
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
tree
well
;
it
be
the
boundary
mark
of
his
youth
 
<EOS>
the
sign
,
to
him
,
of
the
time
when
some
of
his
early
,
strong
feeling
have
leave
him
.
<EOS>
He
feel
sure
they
would
never
return
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
at
this
moment
,
there
be
a
stirring
of
affection
at
the
remembrance
of
that
Arthur
Donnithorne
whom
he
have
believe
in
before
he
have
come
up
to
this
beech
eight
month
ago
.
<EOS>
It
be
affection
for
the
dead
:
that
Arthur
exist
no
longer
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
disturb
by
the
sound
of
approach
footstep
,
but
the
beech
stand
at
a
turning
in
the
road
,
and
he
could
not
see
who
be
come
until
the
tall
slim
figure
in
deep
mourning
suddenly
stand
before
him
at
only
two
yard
'
distance
.
<EOS>
They
both
start
,
and
look
at
each
other
in
silence
.
<EOS>
often
,
in
the
last
fortnight
,
Adam
have
imagine
himself
as
close
to
Arthur
as
this
,
assail
him
with
word
that
should
be
as
harrowing
as
the
voice
of
remorse
,
force
upon
him
a
just
share
in
the
misery
he
have
cause
;
and
often
,
too
,
he
have
tell
himself
that
such
a
meeting
have
well
not
be
.
<EOS>
but
in
imagine
the
meeting
he
have
always
see
Arthur
,
as
he
have
meet
him
on
that
evening
in
the
Grove
,
florid
,
careless
,
light
of
speech
;
and
the
figure
before
him
touch
him
with
the
sign
of
suffer
.
<EOS>
Adam
know
what
suffering
be
 
<EOS>
he
could
not
lay
a
cruel
finger
on
a
bruise
man
.
<EOS>
He
feel
no
impulse
that
he
need
to
resist
.
<EOS>
Silence
be
more
just
than
reproach
.
<EOS>
Arthur
be
the
first
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Adam
,
"
he
say
,
quietly
,
"
it
may
be
a
good
thing
that
we
have
meet
here
,
for
I
wish
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
ask
to
see
you
to
-
morrow
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
pause
,
but
Adam
say
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
be
painful
to
you
to
meet
me
,
"
Arthur
go
on
,
"
but
it
be
not
likely
to
happen
again
for
year
to
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
sir
,
"
say
Adam
,
coldly
,
"
that
be
what
I
mean
to
write
to
you
to
-
morrow
,
as
it
would
be
well
all
dealing
should
be
at
an
end
between
us
,
and
somebody
else
put
in
my
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
feel
the
answer
keenly
,
and
it
be
not
without
an
effort
that
he
speak
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
partly
on
that
subject
I
wish
to
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
to
lessen
your
indignation
against
me
,
or
ask
you
to
do
anything
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
I
only
wish
to
ask
you
if
you
will
help
me
to
lessen
the
evil
consequence
of
the
past
,
which
be
unchangeable
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
consequence
to
myself
,
but
to
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
but
<EOS>
little
I
can
do
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
bad
consequence
will
remain
;
but
something
may
be
do
,
and
you
can
help
me
.
<EOS>
Will
you
listen
to
me
patiently
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
"
say
Adam
,
after
some
hesitation
;
"
I
will
hear
what
it
be
.
<EOS>
if
I
can
help
to
mend
anything
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
anger
'
ull
mend
nothing
<EOS>
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
We
have
have
enough
o
'
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
to
the
Hermitage
,
"
say
Arthur
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
go
there
with
me
and
sit
down
?
<EOS>
We
can
talk
better
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
Hermitage
have
never
be
enter
since
they
leave
it
together
,
for
Arthur
have
lock
up
the
key
in
his
desk
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
when
he
open
the
door
,
there
be
the
candle
burn
out
in
the
socket
;
there
be
the
chair
in
the
same
place
where
Adam
remember
sit
;
there
be
the
waste
-
paper
basket
full
of
scrap
,
and
deep
down
in
it
,
Arthur
feel
in
an
instant
,
there
be
the
little
pink
silk
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
painful
to
enter
this
place
if
their
previous
thought
have
be
less
painful
.
  
<EOS>
They
sit
down
opposite
each
other
in
the
old
place
,
and
Arthur
say
,
"
I
be
go
away
,
Adam
;
I
be
go
into
the
army
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Arthur
feel
that
Adam
ought
to
be
affect
by
this
announcement
 
ought
to
have
a
movement
of
sympathy
towards
him
.
<EOS>
but
Adam
's
lip
remain
firmly
closed
,
and
the
expression
of
his
face
unchanged
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
I
want
to
say
to
you
,
"
Arthur
continue
,
"
be
this
:
one
of
my
reason
for
go
away
be
that
no
one
else
may
leave
Hayslope
 
may
leave
their
home
on
my
account
.
<EOS>
I
would
do
anything
,
there
be
no
sacrifice
I
would
not
make
,
to
prevent
any
further
injury
to
other
through
my
 
through
what
have
happen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
's
word
have
precisely
the
opposite
effect
to
that
he
have
anticipate
.
<EOS>
Adam
think
he
perceive
in
them
that
notion
of
compensation
for
irretrievable
wrong
,
that
self
-
soothe
attempt
to
make
evil
bear
the
same
fruit
as
good
,
which
most
of
all
rouse
his
indignation
.
<EOS>
He
be
as
strongly
impel
to
look
painful
fact
right
in
the
face
as
Arthur
be
to
turn
away
his
eye
from
them
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
he
have
the
wakeful
suspicious
pride
of
a
poor
man
in
the
presence
of
a
rich
man
.
<EOS>
He
feel
his
old
severity
return
as
he
say
,
"
the
time
's
past
for
that
,
sir
.
<EOS>
a
man
should
make
sacrifice
to
keep
clear
of
do
a
wrong
;
sacrifice
will
not
undo
it
when
it
be
do
.
<EOS>
when
people
's
feeling
have
get
a
deadly
wound
,
they
can
not
be
cure
with
favour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Favours
!
"
say
Arthur
,
passionately
;
"
no
<EOS>
;
how
can
you
suppose
I
mean
that
?
<EOS>
but
the
Poysers
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
tell
me
the
Poysers
mean
to
leave
the
place
where
they
have
live
so
many
year
 
for
generation
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
see
,
as
Mr.
Irwine
do
,
that
if
they
could
be
persuade
to
overcome
the
feeling
that
drive
them
away
,
it
would
be
much
well
for
them
in
the
end
to
remain
on
the
old
spot
,
among
the
friend
and
neighbour
who
know
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
,
"
say
Adam
coldly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
then
,
sir
,
folk
's
feeling
be
not
so
easily
overcome
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
hard
for
Martin
Poyser
to
go
to
a
strange
place
,
among
strange
face
,
when
he
be
be
breed
up
on
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
his
father
before
him
;
but
then
it
'
ud
be
hard
for
a
man
with
his
feeling
to
stay
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
how
the
thing
be
to
be
make
any
other
than
hard
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
sort
o
'
damage
,
sir
,
that
can
not
be
make
up
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
be
silent
some
moment
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
other
feeling
dominant
in
him
this
evening
,
his
pride
wince
under
Adam
's
mode
of
treat
him
.
<EOS>
be
not
he
himself
suffer
?
<EOS>
be
not
he
too
oblige
to
renounce
his
most
cherished
hope
?
<EOS>
It
be
now
as
it
have
be
eight
month
ago
 
Adam
be
force
Arthur
to
feel
more
intensely
the
irrevocableness
of
his
own
wrong
-
doing
.
<EOS>
He
be
present
the
sort
of
resistance
that
be
the
most
irritate
to
Arthur
's
eager
ardent
nature
.
<EOS>
but
his
anger
be
subdue
by
the
same
influence
that
have
subdue
Adam
's
when
they
first
confront
each
other
 
by
the
mark
of
suffer
in
a
long
familiar
face
.
<EOS>
the
momentary
struggle
end
in
the
feeling
that
he
could
bear
a
great
deal
from
Adam
,
to
whom
he
have
be
the
occasion
of
bear
so
much
;
but
there
be
a
touch
of
plead
,
boyish
vexation
in
his
tone
as
he
say
,
"
<EOS>
but
people
may
make
injury
bad
by
unreasonable
conduct
 
by
give
way
to
anger
and
satisfy
that
for
the
moment
,
instead
of
think
what
will
be
the
effect
in
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
be
go
to
stay
here
and
act
as
landlord
,
"
he
add
presently
,
with
still
more
eagerness
 
"
if
I
be
careless
about
what
I
have
do
 
<EOS>
what
I
have
be
the
cause
of
,
you
would
have
some
excuse
,
Adam
,
for
go
away
and
encourage
other
to
go
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
some
excuse
then
for
try
to
make
the
evil
bad
.
<EOS>
but
when
I
tell
you
I
be
go
away
for
year
 
<EOS>
when
you
know
what
that
mean
for
me
,
how
it
cut
off
every
plan
of
happiness

I
have
ever
form
 
<EOS>
it
be
impossible
for
a
sensible
man
like
you
to
believe
that
there
be
any
real
ground
for
the
Poysers
refuse
to
remain
.
<EOS>
I
know
their
feeling
about
disgrace
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
have
tell
me
all
;
but
he
be
of
opinion
that
they
may
be
persuade
out
of
this
idea
that
they
be
disgrace
in
the
eye
of
their
neighbour
,
and
that
they
can
not
remain
on
my
estate
,

you
would

hearted
Arthur

He
be
silent

Arthur
see
an
answer
in
his

that
induce
him
to
go
on

with
grow
earnestness

"
<EOS>
and
then
,
if
you
would
talk
to

talk
the

over

I
know
,
of

,
that
they

not

any

I

nothing

I

suffer
less

Irwine

It
would
be
the

it
could
be
nothing

bad

Arthur

Mrs.

Mr.

I

I

if

I

We

<EOS>
as
it

the

the

You

now

there
be
Mr.

My

<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
listen
with
an
admire
interest
to
Adam

discourse
on
building

but
perhaps
it
suggest
to
him
that
the
building
of
his
corn
-
rick
have
be
proceed
a
little
too
long
without
the
control
of
the
master

for
when
Adam
have
do
speak
,
he
get
up
and
say
,
"
well

lad
,
I
will
bid
you

<EOS>
Mr.

Mrs.
Poyser
,
you
perceive
,
have
no
correct
principle
of
education
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
back
to

morrow
if
Mrs.

Mrs.

"
<EOS>

you

stay

you

if

ill

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
,
when
the
good

bye
have
be

,
Dinah
and
Adam
leave
the
Hall
Farm
together
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
Cottage
  
ADAM
do
not
ask
Dinah
to
take
his
arm
when
they
get
out
into
the
lane
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
yet
do
so
,
often
as
they
have
walk
together
,
for
he
have
observe
that
she
never
walk
arm
-
in
-
arm
with
Seth
,
and
he
think
,
perhaps
,
that
kind
of
support
be
not
agreeable
to
her
.
<EOS>
so
they
walk
apart
,
though
side
by
side
,
and
the
close
poke
of
her
little
black
bonnet
hide
her
face
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
be
happy
,
then
,
to
make
the
Hall
Farm
your
home

Dinah
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Adam
say
,
with
the
quiet
interest
of
a
brother
,
who
have
no
anxiety
for
himself
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
pity
,
see
they
be
so
fond
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
Adam
,
my
heart
be
as
their
heart
,
so
far
as
love
for
them
and
care
for
their
welfare
go
,
but
they
be
in
no
present
need
.
<EOS>
Their
sorrow
be
heal
,
and
I
feel
that
I
be
call
back
to
my
old
work
,
in
which
I
find
a
blessing
that
I
have
miss
of
late
in
the
midst
of
too
abundant
worldly
good
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
be
a
vain
thought
to
flee
from
the
work
that
God
appoint
us
,
for
the
sake
of
find
a
great
blessing
to
our
own
soul
,
as
if
we
could
choose
for
ourselves
where
we
shall
find
the
fulness
of
the
Divine
Presence
,
instead
of
seek
it
where
alone
it
be
to
be
find
,
in
love
obedience

<EOS>
but
now
,
I
believe
,
I
have
a
clear
showing
that
my
work
lie
elsewhere
 
at
least
for
a
time
.
<EOS>
in
the
year
to
come
,
if
my
aunt

health
should
fail

she
should
otherwise
need
me

I
shall
return

<EOS>
"
You
know
best

Dinah

Adam

<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
you
would
go
against
the
wish
of
them
that
love
you

and
be
akin
to
you
,
without
a
good
and
sufficient
reason
in
your
own
conscience

<EOS>
I
have
no
right
to
say
anything
about
my

you

well
enough

what
cause
I
have
to
put
you
above

be
order
so
that
you
could
ha

be
my

live
with
us
all
our
life

I
should
ha

count
it
the
great
blessing
as
could
happen
to
us
now
.
<EOS>
but
Seth
tell
me
there
be
no
hope
<EOS>
o

<EOS>
that
:
your
feeling
be
different

perhaps
I
be
take
too
much
upon
me
to

about
it

<EOS>
Dinah
make
no

and
they
walk
on
in
silence
for
some
yard
,
till
they
come
to
the
stone
stile
,
where
,
as
Adam
have
pass
through
first
and
turn
round
to
give
her
his
hand
while
she
mount
the
unusually
high
step
,
she
could
not
prevent
him
from
see
her
face
.
<EOS>
It
strike
him
with
surprise
,
for
the
grey
eye
,
usually
so
mild
and
grave
,
have
the
bright
uneasy
glance
which
accompany
suppress
agitation
,
and
the
slight
flush
in
her
cheek
,
with
which
she
have
come
downstairs
,
be
heighten
to
a
deep
rose
-
colour
.
<EOS>
She
look
as
if
she
be
only
sister
to
Dinah
.
<EOS>
Adam
be
silent
with
surprise
and
conjecture
for
some
moment
,
and
then
he
say
,
"
I
hope
I
have
not
hurt
or
displease
you
by
what
I
have
say
,
Dinah
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
be
make
too
free
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
wish
different
from
what
you
see
to
be
good
,
and
I
be
satisfied
for
you
to
live
thirty
mile
off
,
if
you
think
it
right
.
<EOS>
I
shall
think
of
you
just
as
much
as
I
do
now
,
for
you
be
bind
up
with
what
I
can
no
more
help
remember
than
I
can
help
my
heart
beat
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Adam
!
<EOS>
thus
do
man
blunder
.
<EOS>
Dinah
make
no
answer
,
but
she
presently
say
,
"
have
you
hear
any
news
from
that
poor
young
man
,
since
we
last
speak
of
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
always
call
Arthur
so
;
she
have
never
lose
the
image
of
him
as
she
have
see
him
in
the
prison
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Adam
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
read
me
part
of
a
letter
from
him
yesterday
.
<EOS>
It
be
pretty
certain
,
they
say
,
that
there
will
be
a
peace
soon
,
though
nobody
believe
it
will
last
long
;
but
he
say
he
do
not
mean
to
come
home
.
<EOS>
He
be
no
heart
for
it
yet
,
and
it
be
well
for
other
that
he
should
keep
away
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
think
he
be
in
the
right
not
to
come
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
sorrowful
letter
.
<EOS>
He
ask
about
you
and
the
Poysers
,
as
he
always
do
.
<EOS>
there
be
one
thing
in
the
letter
cut
me
a
good
deal
:
"
You
can
not
think
what
an
old
fellow
I
feel
,
"
he
say
;
"
I
make
no
scheme
now
.
<EOS>
I
be
the
good
when
I
have
a
good
day
's
march
or
fighting
before
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
be
of
a
rash
,
warm
-
hearted
nature
,
like
Esau
,
for
whom
I
have
always
feel
great
pity
,
"
say
Dinah
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
that
meeting
between
the
brother
,
where
Esau
be
so
loving
and
generous
,
and
Jacob
so
timid
and
distrustful
,
<EOS>
notwithstanding
his
sense
of
the
Divine
favour
,
have
always
touch
me
greatly
.
<EOS>
truly
,
I
have
be
tempt
sometimes
to
say
that
Jacob
be
of
a
mean
spirit
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
our
trial
:
we
must
learn
to
see
the
good
in
the
midst
of
much
that
be
unlovely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
"
say
Adam
,
"
I
like
to
read
about
Moses
best
,
in
th
'
Old
Testament
.
<EOS>
He
carry
a
hard
business
well
through
,
and
die
when
other
folk
be
go
to
reap
the
fruit
.
<EOS>
a
man
must
have
courage
to
look
at
his
life
so
,
and
think
what
will
come
of
it
after
he
be
dead
and
go
.
<EOS>
a
good
solid
bit
o
'
work
last
:
if
it
be
only
lay
a
floor
down
,
somebody
be
the
well
for
it
be
do
well
,
besides
the
man
as
do
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
be
both
glad
to
talk
of
subject
that
be
not
personal
,
and
in
this
way
they
go
on
till
they
pass
the
bridge
across
the
Willow
Brook
,
when
Adam
turn
round
and
say
,
"
ah
,
here
be
Seth
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
would
be
home
soon
.
<EOS>
do
he
know
of
you
be
go
,
Dinah
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
tell
him
last
Sabbath
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
remember
now
that
Seth
have
come
home
much
depressed
on
Sunday
evening
,
a
circumstance
which
have
be
very
unusual
with
him
of
late
,
for
the
happiness
he
have
in
see
Dinah
every
week
seem
long
to
have
outweigh
the
pain
of
know
she
would
never
marry
him
.
<EOS>
this
evening
he
have
his
habitual
air
of
dreamy
benignant
contentment
,
until
he
come
quite
close
to
Dinah
and
see
the
trace
of
tear
on
her
delicate
eyelid
and
eyelash
.
<EOS>
He
give
one
rapid
glance
at
his
brother
,
but
Adam
be
evidently
quite
outside
the
current
of
emotion
that
have
shake
Dinah
:
he
wear
his
everyday
look
of
unexpectant
calm
.
<EOS>
Seth
try
not
to
let
Dinah
see
that
he
have
notice
her
face
,
and
only
say
,
"
I
be
thankful
you
be
come
,
Dinah
,
for
Mother
's
be
hunger
after
the
sight
of

<EOS>
She

<EOS>
when
they
enter
the
cottage
,
Lisbeth

in
her
arm

,
too
tired
with

to

Dinah

,
but
Lisbeth
hold
her
fast
,
while
she
be
take
off
her
bonnet
,
and
look
at
her
face
as
one
look
into
a
newly

snowdrop
,
to
renew
the
old
impression
of
purity
and
gentleness

<EOS>
"

in

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
only
a
grief

"
say
Dinah
,
who
do
not
wish
just
now
to
call
forth
Lisbeth
's
remonstrance
by
disclose
her
intention
to
leave
Hayslope
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
know
about

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lisbeth
be
pacify
by
this
prospect
.
<EOS>
and
she
have
the
whole
evening
to
talk
with
Dinah
alone
;
for
there
be
a
new
room
in
the
cottage
,
you
remember
,
build
nearly
two
year
ago
,
in
the
expectation
of
a
new
inmate
;
and
here
Adam
always
sit
when
he
have
writing
to
do
or
plan
to
make
.
<EOS>
Seth
sit
there
too
this
evening
,
for
he
know
his
mother
would
like
to
have
Dinah
all
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
two
pretty
picture
on
the
two
side
of
the
wall
in
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
on
one
side
there
be
the
broad
-
shoulder
,
large
-
featured
,
hardy
old
woman
,
in
her
blue
jacket
and
buff
kerchief
,
with
her
dim
-
eyed
anxious
look
turn
continually
on
the
lily
face
and
the
slight
form
in
the
black
dress
that
be
either
move
lightly
about
in
helpful
activity
,
or
seat
close
by
the
old
woman
's
arm
-
chair
,
hold
her
withered
hand
,
with
eye
lift
up
towards
her
to
speak
a
language
which
Lisbeth
understand
far
better
than
the
Bible
or
the
hymn
-
book
.
<EOS>
She
would
scarcely
listen
to
read
at
all
to
-
night
.
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
nay
,
shut
the
book
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
We
mun
talk
.
<EOS>
I
want
t
'
know
what
thee
be
cryin
'
about
.
<EOS>
Hast
get
trouble
o
'
thy
own
,
like
other
folk
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
there
be
the
two
brother
so
like
each
other
in
the
midst
of
their
unlikeness
:
<EOS>
Adam
with
knit
brow
,
shaggy
hair
,
and
dark
vigorous
colour
,
absorb
in
his
"
figuring
"
;
<EOS>
Seth
,
with
large
rugged
feature
,
the
close
copy
of
his
brother
's
,
but
with
thin
,
wavy
,
brown
hair
and
blue
dreamy
eye
,
as
often
as
not
look
vaguely
out
of
the
window
instead
of
at
his
book
,
although
it
be
a
newly
buy
book
 
Wesley
's
abridgment
of
Madame
Guyon
's
life
,
which
be
full
of
wonder
and
interest
for
him
.
<EOS>
Seth
have
say
to
Adam
,
"
Can
I
help
thee
with
anything
in
here
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
to
make
a
noise
in
the
shop
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
lad
,
"
Adam
answer
,
"
there
be
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
I
must
do
myself
.
<EOS>
Thee'st
get
thy
new
book
to
read
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
often
,
when
Seth
be
quite
unconscious
,
Adam
,
as
he
pause
after
draw
a
line
with
his
ruler
,
look
at
his
brother
with
a
kind
smile
dawn
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
He
know
"
th
'
lad
like
to
sit
full
o
'
thought
he
could
give
no
account
of
;
they
would
never
come
t
'
anything
,
but
they
make
him
happy
,
"
and
in
the
last
year
or
so
,
Adam
have
be
get
more
and
more
indulgent
to
Seth
.
<EOS>
It
be
part
of
that
grow
tenderness
which
come
from
the
sorrow
at
work
within
him
.
  
<EOS>
for
Adam
,
though
you
see
him
quite
master
of
himself
,
work
hard
and
delight
in
his
work
after
his
inborn
inalienable
nature
,
have
not
outlive
his
sorrow
 
have
not
feel
it
slip
from
him
as
a
temporary
burden
,
and
leave
him
the
same
man
again
.
<EOS>
do
any
of
us
?
<EOS>
God
forbid
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
poor
result
of
all
our
anguish
and
our
wrestling
if
we
win
nothing
but
our
old
self
at
the
end
of
it
 
if
we
could
return
to
the
same
blind
love
,
the
same
self
-
confident
blame
,
the
same
light
thought
of
human
suffering
,
the
same
frivolous
gossip
over
blight
human
life
,
the
same
feeble
sense
of
that
unknown
towards
which
we
have
send
forth
irrepressible
cry
in
our
loneliness
.
<EOS>
let
us
rather
be
thankful
that
our
sorrow
live
in
us
as
an
indestructible
force
,
only
change
its
form
,
as
force
do
,
and
pass
from
pain
into
sympathy
 
the
one
poor
word
which
include
all
our
good
insight
and
our
good
love
.
<EOS>
not
that
this
transformation
of
pain
into
sympathy
have
completely
take
place
in
Adam
yet
.
<EOS>
there
be
still
a
great
remnant
of
pain
,
and
this
he
feel
would
subsist
as
long
as
her
pain
be
not
a
memory
,
but
an
exist
thing
,
which
he
must
think
of
as
renew
with
the
light
of
every
new
morning
.
<EOS>
but
we
get
accustomed
to
mental
as
well
as
bodily
pain
,
without
,
for
all
that
,
lose
our
sensibility
to
it
.
<EOS>
It
become
a
habit
of
our
life
,
and
we
cease
to
imagine
a
condition
of
perfect
ease
as
possible
for
us
.
<EOS>
desire
be
chasten
into
submission
,
and
we
be
content
with
our
day
when
we
have
be
able
to
bear
our
grief
in
silence
and
act
as
if
we
be
not
suffer
.
<EOS>
for
it
be
at
such
period
that
the
sense
of
our
life
have
visible
and
invisible
relation
,
beyond
any
of
which
either
our
present
or
prospective
self
be
the
centre
,
grow
like
a
muscle
that
we
be
oblige
to
lean
on
and
exert
.
  
<EOS>
that
be
Adam
's
state
of
mind
in
this
second
autumn
of
his
sorrow
.
<EOS>
His
work
,
as
you
know
,
have
always
be
part
of
his
religion
,
and
from
very
early
day
he
see
clearly
that
good
carpentry
be
God
's
will
 
<EOS>
be
that
form
of
God
's
will
that
most
immediately
concern
him
.
<EOS>
but
now
there
be
no
margin
of
dream
for
him
beyond
this
daylight
reality
,
no
holiday
-
time
in
the
work
-
day
world
,
no
moment
in
the
distance
when
duty
would
take
off
her
iron
glove
and
breast
-
plate
and
clasp
him
gently
into
rest
.
<EOS>
He
conceive
no
picture
of
the
future
but
one
make
up
of
hard
-
work
day
such
as
he
live
through
,
with
grow
contentment
and
intensity
of
interest
,
every
fresh
week
.
<EOS>
love
,
he
think
,
could
never
be
anything
to
him
but
a
live
memory
 
a
limb
lop
off
,
but
not
go
from
consciousness
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
that
the
power
of
loving
be
all
the
while
gain
new
force
within
him
;
that
the
new
sensibility
buy
by
a
deep
experience
be
so
many
new
fibre
by
which
it
be
possible
,
nay
,
necessary
to
him
,
that
his
nature
should
intertwine
with
another
.
<EOS>
yet
he
be
aware
that
common
affection
and
friendship
be
more
precious
to
him
than
they
use
to
be
 
that
he
cling
more
to
his
mother
and
Seth
,
and
have
an
unspeakable
satisfaction
in
the
sight
or
imagination
of
any
small
addition
to
their
happiness
.
<EOS>
the
Poysers
,
too
 
hardly
three
or
four
day
pass
but
he
feel
the
need
of
see
them
and
interchange
word
and
look
of
friendliness
with
them
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
feel
this
,
probably
,
even
if
Dinah
have
not
be
with
them
,
but
he
have
only
say
the
simple
truth
in
tell
Dinah
that
he
put
her
above
all
other
friend
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Could
anything
be
more
natural
?
<EOS>
for
in
the
dark
moment
of
memory
the
thought
of
her
always
come
as
the
first
ray
of
return
comfort
.
<EOS>
the
early
day
of
gloom
at
the
Hall
Farm
have
be
gradually
turn
into
soft
moonlight
by
her
presence
;
and
in
the
cottage
,
too
,
for
she
have
come
at
every
spare
moment
to
soothe
and
cheer
poor
Lisbeth
,
who
have
be
stricken
with
a
fear
that
subdue
even
her
querulousness
at
the
sight
of
her
darling
Adam
's
grief
-
wear
face
.
<EOS>
He
have
become
used
to
watch
her
light
quiet
movement
,
her
pretty
loving
way
to
the
child
,
when
he
go
to
the
Hall
Farm
;
to
listen
for
her
voice
as
for
a
recurrent
music
;
to
think
everything
she
say
and
do
be
just
right
,
and
could
not
have
be
well
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
his
wisdom
,
he
could
not
find
fault
with
her
for
her
overindulgence
of
the
child
,
who
have
manage
to
convert
Dinah
the
preacher
,
before
whom
a
circle
of
rough
man
have
often
tremble
a
little
,
into
a
convenient
household
slave
 
though
Dinah
herself
be
rather
ashamed
of
this
weakness
,
and
have
some
inward
conflict
as
to
her
departure
from
the
precept
of
Solomon
.
<EOS>
yes
,
there
be
one
thing
that
may
have
be
well
;
she
may
have
love
Seth
and
consent
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
He
feel
a
little
vexed
,
for
his
brother
's
sake
,
and
he
could
not
help
think
regretfully
how
Dinah
,
as
Seth
's
wife
,
would
have
make
their
home
as
happy
as
it
could
be
for
them
all
 
how
she
be
the
one
being
that
would
have
soothe
their
mother
's
last
day
into
peacefulness
and
rest
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
wonderful
<EOS>
she
do
not
love
th
'
lad
,
"
Adam
have
say
sometimes
to
himself
,
"
for
anybody
'
ud
think
he
be
just
cut
out
for
her
.
<EOS>
but
her
heart
be
so
take
up
with
other
thing
.
<EOS>
She
be
<EOS>
one
o
'
those
woman
that
feel
no
drawing
towards
have
a
husband
and
child
o
'
their
own
.
<EOS>
She
think
she
should
be
fill
up
with
her
own
life
then
,
and
she
be
be
use
so
to
live
in
other
folk
's
care
,
she
can
not
bear
the
thought
of
her
heart
be
shut
up
from
'em
.
<EOS>
I
see
how
it
be
,
well
enough
.
<EOS>
She
be
cut
out
o
'
different
stuff
from
most
woman
<EOS>
:
I
see
that
long
ago
.
<EOS>
She
be
never
easy
<EOS>
but
when
she
be
help
somebody
,
and
marriage
'
ud
interfere
with
her
way
 
that
be
true
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
right
to
be
contrive
and
think
it
'
ud
be
well
if
she
would
have
Seth
,
as
if
I
be
wise
than
she
be
 
or
than
God
either
,
for
He
make
her
what
she
be
,
and
that
be
one
o
'
<EOS>
the
great
blessing
I
have
ever
have
from
His
hand
,
and
other
besides
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
self
-
reproof
have
recur
strongly
to
Adam
's
mind
when
he
gather
from
Dinah
's
face
that
he
have
wound
her
by
refer
to
his
wish
that
she
have
accept
Seth
,
and
so
he
have
endeavour
to
put
into
the
strong
word
his
confidence
in
her
decision
as
right
 
his
resignation
even
to
her
go
away
from
them
and
cease
to
make
part
of
their
life
otherwise
than
by
live
in
their
thought
,
if
that
separation
be
choose
by
herself
.
<EOS>
He
feel
sure
she
know
quite
well
enough
how
much
he
care
to
see
her
continually
 
to
talk
to
her
with
the
silent
consciousness
of
a
mutual
great
remembrance
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
possible
she
should
hear
anything
but
self
-
renounce
affection
and
respect
in
his
assurance
that
he
be
content
for
her
to
go
away
;
and
yet
there
remain
an
uneasy
feeling
in
his
mind
that
he
have
not
say
quite
the
right
thing
 
<EOS>
that
,
somehow
,
Dinah
have
not
understand
him
.
  
<EOS>
Dinah
must
have
rise
a
little
before
the
sun
the
next
morning
,
for
she
be
downstairs
about
five
o'clock
.
<EOS>
so
be
Seth
,
for
,
through
Lisbeth
's
obstinate
refusal
to
have
any
woman
-
helper
in
the
house
,
he
have
learn
to
make
himself
,
as
Adam
say
,
"
very
handy
in
the
housework
,
"
that
he
may
save
his
mother
from
too
great
weariness
;
on
which
ground
I
hope
you
will
not
think
him
unmanly
,
any
more
than
you
can
have
think
the
gallant
Colonel
Bath
unmanly
when
he
make
the
gruel
for
his
invalid
sister
.
<EOS>
Adam
,
who
have
sit
up
late
at
his
writing
,
be
still
asleep
,
and
be
not
likely
,
Seth
say
,
to
be
down
till
breakfast
-
time
.
<EOS>
often
as
Dinah
have
visit
Lisbeth
during
the
last
eighteen
month
,
she
have
never
sleep
in
the
cottage
since
that
night
after
Thias
's
death
,
when
,
you
remember
,
Lisbeth
praise
her
deft
movement
and
even
give
a
modify
approval
to
her
porridge
.
<EOS>
but
in
that
long
interval
Dinah
have
make
great
advance
in
household
cleverness
,
and
<EOS>
this
morning
,
since
Seth
be
there
to
help
,
she
be
bent
on
bring
everything
to
a
pitch
of
cleanliness
and
order
that
would
have
satisfy
her
Aunt
Poyser
.
<EOS>
the
cottage
be
far
from
that
standard
at
present
,
for
Lisbeth
's
rheumatism
have
force
her
to
give
up
her
old
habit
of
dilettante
scouring
and
polishing
.
<EOS>
when
the
kitchen
be
to
her
mind
,
Dinah
go
into
the
new
room
,
where
Adam
have
be
write
the
night
before
,
to
see
what
sweep
and
dusting
be
need
there
.
<EOS>
She
open
the
window
and
let
in
the
fresh
morning
air
,
and
the
smell
of
the
sweet
-
brier
,
and
the
bright
low
-
slant
ray
of
the
early
sun
,
which
make
a
glory
about
her
pale
face
and
pale
auburn
hair
as
she
hold
the
long
brush
,
and
sweep
,
singe
to
herself
in
a
very
low
tone
 
like
a
sweet
summer
murmur
that
you
have
to
listen
for
very
closely
 
one
of
Charles
Wesley
's
hymn
:
       
Eternal
Beam
of
Light
Divine
,
     
Fountain
of
unexhausted
love
,
     
<EOS>
in
whom
the
Father
's
glory
shine
,
     
through
earth
beneath
and
heaven
above
;
       
Jesus
!
<EOS>
the
weary
wanderer
's
rest
<EOS>
,
     
give
me
thy
easy
yoke
to
bear
;
     
<EOS>
with
steadfast
patience
arm
my
breast
,
     
with
spotless
love
and
holy
fear
.
       
<EOS>
Speak
to
my
war
passion
,
"
peace
!
"
     
<EOS>
say
to
my
tremble
heart
,
"
be
still

"
     
<EOS>
Thy
power
<EOS>
my
strength
and
fortress
be

for
all
thing
serve
thy
sovereign
will
.
  
<EOS>
She
lay
by
the
brush
and
take
up
the
duster
;
and
if
you
have
ever
live
in
Mrs.
Poyser
's
household
,
you
would
know
how
the
duster
behave
in
Dinah
's
hand
 
how
it
go
into
every
small
corner
,
and
on
every
ledge
in
and
out
of
sight
 
<EOS>
how
it
go
again
and
again
round
every
bar
of
the
chair
,
and
every
leg
,
and
under
and
over
everything
that
lie
on
the
table
,
till
it
come
to
Adam
's
paper
and
ruler
and
the
open
desk
near
them
.
<EOS>
Dinah
dust
up
to
the
very
edge
of
these
and
then
hesitate
,
look
at
them
with
a
longing
but
timid
eye
.
<EOS>
It
be
painful
to
see
how
much
dust
there
be
among
them
.
<EOS>
as
she
be
look
in
this
way
,
she
hear
Seth
's
step
just
outside
the
open
door
,
towards
which
her
back
be
turn
,
and
say
,
raise
her
clear
treble
,
"
Seth
,
be
your
brother
wrathful
when
his
paper
be
stir
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
very
,
when
they
be
not
put
back
in
the
right
place
,
"
say
a
deep
strong
voice
,
not
Seth
's
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
Dinah
have
put
her
hand
<EOS>
unaware
on
a
vibrate
chord
.
<EOS>
She
be
shake
with
an
intense
thrill
,
and
for
the
instant
feel
nothing
else
;
then
she
know
her
cheek
be
glow
,
and
dare
not
look
round
,
but
stand
still
,
distressed
because
she
could
not
say
good
-
morning
in
a
friendly
way
.
<EOS>
Adam
,
find
that
she
do
not
look
round
so
as
to
see
the
smile
on
his
face
,
be
afraid
she
have
think
him
serious
about
his
wrathfulness
,
and
go
up
to
her
,
so
that
she
be
oblige
to
look
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
You
think
I
be
a
cross
fellow
at
home
,
Dinah
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
smilingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
Dinah
,
look
up
with
timid
eye
,
"
not
so
.
<EOS>
but
you
may
be
put
about
by
find
thing
meddle
with
;
and
even
the
man
Moses
,
the
meek
of
man
,
be
wrathful
sometimes
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
come
,
then
,
"
say
Adam
,
look
at
her
affectionately
,
"
I
will
help
you
move
the
thing
,
and
put
'em
back
again
,
and
then
they
can
not
get
wrong
.
<EOS>
You
be
get
to
be
your
aunt
's
own
niece
,
I
see
,
for
particularness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
begin
their
little
task
together
,
but
Dinah
have
not
recover
herself
sufficiently
to
think
of
any
remark
,
and
Adam
look
at
her
uneasily
.
<EOS>
Dinah
,
he
think
,
have
seem
to
disapprove
him
somehow
lately
;
she
have
not
be
so
kind
and
open
to
him
as
she
use
to
be
.
<EOS>
He
want
her
to
look
at
him
,
and
be
as
pleased
as
he
be
himself
with
do
this
bit
of
playful
work
.
<EOS>
but
Dinah
do
not
look
at
him
 
<EOS>
it
be
easy
for
her
to
avoid
look
at
the
tall
man
 
and
when
at
last
there
be
no
more
dusting
to
be
do
and
no
further
excuse
for
him
to
linger
near
her
,
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
,
and
say
,
in
rather
a
plead
tone
,
"
Dinah
,
you
be
not
displeased
with
me
for
anything
,
be
you
?
<EOS>
I
have
not
say
or
do
anything
to
make
you
think
ill
of
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
question
surprise
her
,
and
relieve
her
by
give
a
new
course
to
her
feeling
.
<EOS>
She
look
up
at
him
now
,
quite
earnestly
,
almost
with
the
tear
come
,
and
say
,
"
oh
,
no
,
Adam
!
<EOS>
how
could
you
think
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
bear
you
not
to
feel
as
much
a
friend
to
me
as
I
do
to
you
,
"
say
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
and
you
do
not
know
the
value
I
set
on
the
very
thought
of
you
,
Dinah
.
<EOS>
that
be
what
I
mean
yesterday
,
when
I
say
I
would
be
content
for
you
to
go
,
if
you
think
right
.
<EOS>
I
mean
,
the
thought
of
you
be
worth
so
much
to
me
<EOS>
,
I
should
feel
I
ought
to
be
thankful
,
and
not
grumble
,
if
you
see
right
to
go
away
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
do
mind
part
with
you
,
Dinah

<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
dear
friend
,
"
say
Dinah
,
tremble
,
but
try
to
speak
calmly
,
"
I
know
you
have
a
brother
's
heart
towards
me
,
and
we
shall
often
be
with
one
another
in
spirit
;
<EOS>
but
at
this
season
I
be
in
heaviness
through
manifold
temptation
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
mark
me
.
<EOS>
I
feel
called
to
leave
my
kindred
for
a
while
;
but
it
be
a
trial
 
the
flesh
be
weak

"
  
<EOS>
Adam
see
that
it
pain
her
to
be
oblige
to
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hurt
you
by
talk
about
it
,
Dinah
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
let
's
see
if
Seth
's
ready
with
breakfast
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
that
be
a
simple
scene
,
reader
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
almost
certain
that
you
,
too
,
have
be
in
love
 
perhaps
,
even
,
more
than
once
,
though
you
may
not
choose
to
say
so
to
all
your
feminine
friend
.
<EOS>
if
so
,
you
will
no
more
think
the
slight
word
<EOS>
,
the
timid
look
,
<EOS>
the
tremulous
touch
,
by
which
two
human
soul
approach
each
other
gradually
,
like
two
little
quivering
rain
-
stream
,
before
they
mingle
into
one
 
you
will
no
more
think
these
thing
trivial
than
you
will
think
the
first
-
detect
sign
of
come
spring
trivial
,
though
they
be
but
a
faint
indescribable
something
in
the
air
and
in
the
song
of
the
bird
,
and
the
tiny
perceptible
bud
on
the
hedge
-
row
branch
.
<EOS>
those
slight
word
and
look
and
touch
be
part
of
the
soul
's
language
;
and
the
fine
language
,
I
believe
,
be
chiefly
make
up
of
unimposing
word
,
such
as
"
light
,
"
"
sound
,
"
"
star
,
"
"
music
"
 
word
really
not
worth
look
at
,
or
hearing
,
in
themselves
,
any
more
than
"
chip
"
or
"
sawdust
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
only
that
they
happen
to
be
the
sign
of
something
unspeakably
great
and
beautiful
.
<EOS>
I
be
of
opinion
that
love
be
a
great
and
beautiful
thing
too
,
and
if
you
agree
with
me
,
the
small
sign
of
it
will
not
be
chip
and
sawdust
to
you
:
<EOS>
they
will
rather
be
like
those
little
word
,
"
light
"
and
"
music
,
"
stir
the
long

wind
fibre

your

Lisbeth
rise
from
the
bench
at
this

and
go
out
of
the
workshop
,
leave
Seth
in
much
anxiety
lest
she
should
disturb
Adam
's
mind
about
Dinah
.
<EOS>
He
console
himself
after
a
time
with
reflect
that
,
since
Adam
's
trouble
,
Lisbeth
have
be
very
timid
about
speak
to
him
on
matter
of
feeling
,
and
that
she
would
hardly
dare
to
approach
this
tender
of
all
subject
.
<EOS>
even
if
she
do
,
he
hope
Adam
would
not
take
much
notice
of
what
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
Seth
be
right
in
believe
that
Lisbeth
would
be
hold
in
restraint
by
timidity
,
and
during
the
next
three
day
,
the
interval
in
which
she
have
an
opportunity
of
speak
to
Adam
be
too
rare
and
short
to
cause
her
any
strong
temptation
.
<EOS>
but
in
her
long
solitary
hour
she
brood
over
her
regretful
thought
about
Dinah
,
till
they
have
grow
very
near
that
point
of
unmanageable
strength
when
thought
be
apt
to
take
wing
out
of
their
secret
nest
in
a
startling
manner
.
<EOS>
and
on
Sunday
morning
,
when
Seth
go
away
to
chapel
at
Treddleston
,
the
dangerous
opportunity
come
.
  
<EOS>
Sunday
morning
be
the
happy
time
in
all
the
week
to
Lisbeth
,
for
as
there
be
no
service
at
Hayslope
church
till
the
afternoon
,
Adam
be
always
at
home
,
do
nothing
but
reading
,
an
occupation
in
which
she
could
venture
to
interrupt
him
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
she
have
always
a
well
dinner
than
usual
to
prepare
for
her
son
 
very
frequently
for
Adam
and
herself
alone
,
Seth
be
often
away
the
entire
day
 
and
the
smell
of
the
roast
meat
before
the
clear
fire
in
the
clean
kitchen
,
<EOS>
the
clock
tick
in
a
peaceful
Sunday
manner
,
her
darling
Adam
seat
near
her
in
his
good
clothe
,
do
nothing
very
important
,
so
that
she
could
go
and
stroke
her
hand
across
his
hair
if
she
like
,
and
see
him
look
up
at
her
and
smile
,
while
Gyp
,
rather
jealous
,
poke
his
muzzle
up
between
them
 
all
these
thing
make
poor
Lisbeth
's
earthly
paradise
.
  
<EOS>
the
book
Adam
most
often
read
on
a
Sunday
morning
be
his
large
picture
Bible
,
and
this
morning
it
lie
open
before
him
on
the
round
white
deal
table
in
the
kitchen
;
for
he
sit
there
in
spite
of
the
fire
,
because
he
know
his
mother
like
to
have
him
with
her
,
and
it
be
the
only
day
in
the
week
when
he
could
indulge
her
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
like
to
see
Adam
read
his
Bible
.
<EOS>
He
never
open
it
on
a
weekday
,
and
so
he
come
to
it
as
a
holiday
book
,
serve
him
for
history
,
biography
,
and
poetry
.
<EOS>
He
hold
one
hand
thrust
between
his
waistcoat
button
,
and
the
other
ready
to
turn
the
page
,
and
in
the
course
of
the
morning
you
would
have
see
many
change
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
sometimes
his
lip
move
in
semi
-
articulation
 
<EOS>
it
be
when
he
come
to
a
speech
that
he
could
fancy
himself
uttering
,
such
as
Samuel
's
die
speech
to
the
people
;
then
his
eyebrow
would
be
raise
,
and
the
corner
of
his
mouth
would
quiver
a
little
with
sad
sympathy
 
<EOS>
something
,
perhaps
old
Isaac
's
meeting
with
his
son
,
touch
him
closely
;
at
other
time
,
over
the
New
Testament
,
a
very
solemn
look
would
come
upon
his
face
,
and
he
would
every
now
and
then
shake
his
head
in
serious
assent
,
or
just
lift
up
his
hand
and
let
it
fall
again
.
<EOS>
and
on
some
morning
,
when
he
read
in
the
Apocrypha
,
of
which
he
be
very
fond
,
the
son
of
Sirach
's
keen
-
edge
word
would
bring
a
delighted
smile
,
though
he
also
enjoy
the
freedom
of
occasionally
differ
from
an
Apocryphal
writer
.
<EOS>
for
Adam
know
the
article
quite
well
,
as
become
a
good
churchman
.
  
<EOS>
Lisbeth
,
in
the
pause
of
attend
to
her
dinner
,
always
sit
opposite
to
him
and
watch
him
,
till
she
could
rest
no
longer
without
go
up
to
him
and
give
him
a
caress
,
to
call
his
attention
to
her
.
<EOS>
this
morning
he
be
read
the
Gospel
accord
to
St.
Matthew
,
and
Lisbeth
have
be
stand
close
by
him
for
some
minute
,
stroke
his
hair
,
which
be
smooth
than
usual
this
morning
,
and
look
down
at
the
large
page
with
silent
wonderment
at
the
mystery
of
letter
.
<EOS>
She
be
encourage
to
continue
this
caress
,
because
when
she
first
go
up
to
him
,
he
have
throw
himself
back
in
his
chair
to
look
at
her
affectionately
and
say
,
"
why
,
Mother
,
thee
look'st
rare
and
hearty
this
morning
.
<EOS>
eh
,
Gyp
want
me
t
'
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
abide
to
think
I
love
thee
the
good
.
"
<EOS>
Lisbeth
say
nothing
,
because
she
want
to
say
so
many
thing
.
<EOS>
and
now
there
be
a
new
leaf
to
be
turn
over
,
and
it
be

that
be
the

Lisbeth
have
go

far
now
to

after

again

<EOS>
Adam
throw
himself
back
in

look
at
his
mother

<EOS>
He
understand
now
what
she
have
be
aim
at
from
the
beginning
of
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
unreasonable
,
impracticable
a
wish
as
she
have
ever
urge
,
but
he
could
not
help
be
move
by
so
entirely
new
an
idea
.
<EOS>
the
chief
point
,
however
,
be
to
chase
away
the
notion
from
his
mother
's
mind
as
quickly
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
he

gravely
,

Dinah

"
  
<EOS>
the
blood
rush
to
Adam
's
face
,
and
for
a
few
moment
he
be
not
quite
conscious
where
he
be
.
<EOS>
His
mother
and
the
kitchen
have
vanish
for
him
,
and
he
see
nothing
but
<EOS>
Dinah
's
face
turn
up
towards
his
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
there
be
a
resurrection
of
his
dead
joy
.
<EOS>
but
he
wake
up
very
speedily
from
that
dream
(
the
waking
be
chill
and
sad
)
<EOS>
,
for
it
would
have
be
very
foolish
in
him
to
believe
his
mother
's
word
 
she
could
have
no
ground
for
them
.
<EOS>
He
be
prompt
to
express
his
disbelief
very
strongly
 
perhaps
that
he
may
call
forth
the
proof
,
if
there
be
any
to
be
offer
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
dost

Adam
have
thrust
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
and
be
look
down
at
the
book
on
the
table
,
without
see
any
of
the
letter
.
<EOS>
He
be
tremble
like
a
gold
-
seeker
who
see
the
strong
promise
of
gold
but
see
in
the
same
moment
a
sickening
vision
of
disappointment
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
trust
his
mother
's
insight
;
she
have
see
what
she
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
and
yet
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
now
the
suggestion
have
be
make
to
him
,
he
remember
so
many
thing
,
very
slight
thing
,
like
the
stirring
of
the
water
by
an
imperceptible
breeze
,
which
seem
to
him
some
confirmation
of
his
mother
's
word

notice
that
he
be
move

She
go

"
  
<EOS>
Adam
could
sit
still
no
longer
.
<EOS>
He
rise
,
take
down
his
hat
,
and
go
out
into
the
field
.
  
<EOS>
the
sunshine
be
on
them
:
that
early
autumn
sunshine
which
we
should
know
be
not
summer
's
,
even
if
there
be
not
the
touch
of
yellow
on
the
lime
and
chestnut
;
<EOS>
the
Sunday
sunshine
too
,
which
have
more
than
autumnal
calmness
for
the
work
man
;
the
morning
sunshine
,
which
still
leave
the
dew
-
crystal
on
the
fine
gossamer
webs
in
the
shadow
of
the
bushy
hedgerow
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
need
the
calm
influence
;
he
be
amazed
at
the
way
in
which
this
new
thought
of
Dinah
's
love
have
take
possession
of
him
,
with
an
overmaster
power
that
make
all
other
feeling
give
way
before
the
impetuous
desire
to
know
that
the
thought
be
true
.
<EOS>
strange
,
that
till
that
moment
the
possibility
of
their
ever
be
lover
have
never
cross
his
mind
,
and
yet
now
,
all
his
longing
suddenly
go
out
towards
that
possibility
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
more
doubt
or
hesitation
as
to
his
own
wish
than
the
bird
that
fly
towards
the
opening
through
which
the
daylight
gleam
and
the
breath
of
heaven
enter
.
  
<EOS>
the
autumnal
Sunday
sunshine
soothe
him
,
but
not
by
prepare
him
with
resignation
to
the
disappointment
if
his
mother
 
if
he
himself
 
prove
to
be
mistake
about
Dinah
.
<EOS>
It
soothe
him
by
gentle
encouragement
of
his
hope
.
<EOS>
Her
love
be
so
like
that
calm
sunshine
that
they
seem
to
make
one
presence
to
him
,
and
he
believe
in
them
both
alike
.
<EOS>
and
Dinah
be
so
bind
up
with
the
sad
memory
of
his
first
passion
that
he
be
not
forsake
them
,
but
rather
give
them
a
new
sacredness
by
love
her
.
<EOS>
nay
,
his
love
for
her
have
grow
out
of
that
past
:
it
be
the
noon
of
that
morning
.
  
<EOS>
but
Seth
?
<EOS>
Would
the
lad
be
hurt
?
<EOS>
hardly
;
for
he
have
seem
quite
contented
of
late
,
and
there
be
no
selfish
jealousy
in
him
;
he
have
never
be
jealous
of
his
mother
's
fondness
for
Adam
.
<EOS>
but
have
he
see
anything
of
what
their
mother
talk
about
?
<EOS>
Adam
long
to
know
this
,
for
he
think
he
could
trust
Seth
's
observation
better
than
his
mother
's
.
<EOS>
He
must
talk
to
Seth
before
he
go
to
see
Dinah
,
and
,
with
this
intention
in
his
mind
,
he
walk
back
to
the
cottage
and
say
to
his
mother
,
"
do
Seth
say
anything
to
thee
about
when
he
be
come
home
?
<EOS>
Will
he
be
back
to
dinner
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
aye
,
lad
,
he
will
be
back
for
a
wonder
.
<EOS>
He
isna
go
to
Treddles'on
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
somewhere
else
a
-
preachin
'
and
a
-
prayin
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hast
any
notion
which
way
he
be
go
?
"
say
Adam
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
but
he
aften
go
to
th
'
Common
.
<EOS>
Thee
know'st
more
o
's
going
nor
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
want
to
go
and
meet
Seth
,
but
he
must
content
himself
with
walk
about
the
near
field
and
get
sight
of
him
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
that
would
not
be
for
more
than
an
hour
to
come
,
for
Seth
would
scarcely
be
at
home
much
before
their
dinner
-
time
,
which
be
twelve
o'clock
.
<EOS>
but
Adam
could
not
sit
down
to
his
reading
again
,
and
he
saunter
along
by
the
brook
and
stand
lean
against
the
stile
,
with
eager
intense
eye
,
which
look
as
if
they
see
something
very
vividly
;
but
it
be
not
the
brook
or
the
willow
,
not
the
field
or
the
sky
.
<EOS>
again
and
again
his
vision
be
interrupt
by
wonder
at
the
strength
of
his
own
feeling
,
at
the
strength
and
sweetness
of
this
new
love
 
almost
like
the
wonder
a
man
feel
at
the
add
power
he
find
in
himself
for
an
art
which
he
have
lay
aside
for
a
space
.
<EOS>
how
be
it
that
the
poet
have
say
so
many
fine
thing
about
our
first
love
,
so
few
about
our
later
love
?
<EOS>
be
their
first
poem
their
good
?
<EOS>
or
be
not
those
the
good
which
come
from
their
full
thought
,
their
large
experience
,
their
deeper
-
root
affection
?
<EOS>
the
boy
's
flutelike
voice
have
its
own
spring
charm
;
but
the
man
should
yield
a
richer
deep
music
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
there
be
Seth
,
visible
at
the
farth
stile
,
and
Adam
hasten
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
Seth
be
surprised
,
and
think
something
unusual
must
have
happen
,
but
when
Adam
come
up
,
his
face
say
plainly
enough
that
it
be
nothing
alarming
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
hast
be
?
"
say
Adam
,
when
they
be
side
by
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
to
the
Common
,
"
say
Seth
.
<EOS>
"
Dinah
be
be
speak
the
Word
to
a
little
company
of
hearer
at
Brimstone
's
,
as
they
call
him
.
<EOS>
They
be
folk
as
never
go
to
church
hardly
 
them
on
the
Common
 
<EOS>
but
they
will
go
and
hear
Dinah
a
bit
.
<EOS>
She
be
be
speak
with
power
this
forenoon
from
the
word
,
"
I
come
not
to
call
the
righteous
,
but
sinner
to
repentance
.
"
<EOS>
and
there
be
a
little
thing
happen
as
be
pretty
to
see
.
<EOS>
the
woman
mostly
bring
their
child
with
'em
,
but
to
-
day
there
be
one
stout
curly
head
fellow
about
three
or
four
year
old
,
that
I
never
see
there
before
.
<EOS>
He
be
as
naughty
as
could
be
at
the
beginning
while
I
be
pray
,
and
while
we
be
singe
,
but
when
we
all
sit
down
and
Dinah
begin
to
speak
,
th
'
young
un
stand
stock
still
all
at
once
,
and
begin
to
look
at
her
with
's
mouth
open
,
and
presently
he
run
away
from
<EOS>
's
mother
and
go
to
Dinah
,
and
pull
at
her
,
like
a
little
dog
,
for
her
to
take
notice
of
him
.
<EOS>
so
Dinah
lift
him
up
and
hold
th
'
lad
on
her
lap
,
while
she
go
on
speak
;
and
he
be
as
good
as
could
be
till
he
go
to
sleep
 
and
the
mother
cry
to
see
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
pity
<EOS>
she
shouldna
be
a
mother
herself
,
"
say
Adam
,
"
so
fond
as
the
child
be
of
her
.
<EOS>
dost
think
she
be
quite
fix
against
marrying
,
Seth
?
<EOS>
dost
think
nothing
'
ud
turn
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
peculiar
in
his
brother
's
tone
,
which
make
Seth
steal
a
glance
at
his
face
before
he
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
'
ud
be
wrong
of
me
to
say
nothing
'
ud
turn
her
,
"
he
answer
.
<EOS>
"
but
if
thee
mean'st
it
about
myself
,
I
have
give
up
all
thought
as
she
can
ever
be
my
wife
.
<EOS>
She
call
me
her
brother
,
and
that
be
enough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
dost
think
she
may
ever
get
fond
enough
of
anybody
else
to
be
willing
to
marry
'
em
?
"
say
Adam
rather
shyly
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Seth
,
after
some
hesitation
,
"
it
be
cross
my
mind
sometimes
<EOS>
o
'
late
as
she
may
;
but
Dinah
'
ud
let
no
fondness
for
the
creature
draw
her
out
<EOS>
o
'
the
path
as
she
believe
God
have
mark
out
for
her

<EOS>
if
she
think
the
leading
be
not
from
Him
,
she
be
not
one
to
be
bring
under
the
power
of
it
.
<EOS>
and
she
be
allay
seem
clear
about
that
 
as
her
work
be
to
minister
t

other
,
and
make
no
home
for
herself
<EOS>
i

this
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
suppose

"
say
Adam

earnestly
,
"
suppose
there
be
a

do
just

she

<EOS>
other

<EOS>
that
be
to

,
not

<EOS>
there
be
Mrs.

"
  
<EOS>
a
new

break
in
on

<EOS>
He
turn
round
,
and
lay
his

say
,
"
why

"
  
<EOS>
Adam
look
doubtfully
at
Seth

inquiring

and
say
,
"
Wouldst

hurt
if

Nay

"
  
<EOS>
there
be
silence
a

as

and
then
Seth

,
"
I
would

so
he
call
Dinah
 
<EOS>
but
this
do
not
disappoint
Adam
,
although
the
"
everybody
"
be
so
liberal
as
to
include
Nancy
the
dairymaid
,
whose
work
of
necessity
be
not
unfrequently
incompatible
with
church
-
going
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
perfect
stillness
about
the
house

<EOS>
the
door
be
all
closed

seem
quieter
than

<EOS>
Adam
hear
the
water
gently
drip
from
the
pump
 
that
be
the
only
sound
 
and
he
knock
at
the
house
door
rather
softly
,
as
be
suitable
in
that
stillness
.
  
<EOS>
the
door
open

and
Dinah
stand
before
him
,
colour
deeply
with
the
great
surprise
of
see
Adam
at
this
hour
,
when
she
know
it
be
his
regular
practice
to
be
at
church
.
<EOS>
yesterday
he
would
have
say
to
her
without
any
difficulty
,
"
I
come
to
see
you
,
Dinah
<EOS>
:
I
know
the
rest

"
<EOS>
but
to
-
day
something
prevent
him
from
say
that
,
and
he
put
out
his
hand
to
her
in
silence
.
<EOS>
neither
of
them
speak
,
and
yet
both
wish
they
could
speak
,
as
Adam
enter
,
and
they
sit
down
.
<EOS>
Dinah
take
the
chair
she
have
just
leave
;
it
be
at
the
corner
of
the
table
near
the
window
,
and
there
be
a
book
lie
on
the
table
,
but
it
be
not
open
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
sit
perfectly
still
,
look
at
the
small
bit
of
clear
fire
in
the
bright
grate
.
<EOS>
Adam

down
opposite
her
,
in
Mr.

"
  
<EOS>
"
no

very
hearty
to

"
say
Adam
,
happy
in
the
sign
of
Dinah
's
feeling
at
the
sight
of
him
,
but
shy
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
nobody
at
home
,

,
"
Dinah

;
"
but
you
will
wait

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
Adam
say
,
and
then
pause
,
before
he
add
,
"
I
be
think
about
you
:
that
be
the
reason
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
confession
be
very
awkward
and
sudden
<EOS>
,
Adam
feel
,
for
he
think
Dinah
must
understand
all
he
mean
.
<EOS>
but
the
frankness
of
the
word
cause
her
immediately
to
interpret
them
into
a
renewal
of
his
brotherly
regret
that
she
be
go
away
,
and
she
answer
calmly
,
"
do
not
be
careful
and
troubled
for
me
,
Adam
.
<EOS>
I
have
all
thing
and
abound
at
Snowfield
.
<EOS>
and
my
mind
be
at
rest
,
for
I
be
not
seek
my
own
will
in
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
if
thing
be
different
,
Dinah
,
"
say
Adam
,
hesitatingly
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
know
thing
that
perhaps
you
do
not
know
now
....
"
  
Dinah
look
at
him
inquiringly
,
but
instead
of
go
on
,
he
reach
a
chair
and
bring
it
near
the
corner
of
the
table
where
she
be
sit
.
<EOS>
She
wonder
,
and
be
afraid
 
and
the
next
moment
her
thought
fly
to
the
past
:
be
it
something
about
those
distant
unhappy
one
that
she
do
not
know
?
  
<EOS>
Adam
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
sweet
to
look
at
her
eye
,
which
have
now
a
self
-
forgetful
questioning
in
them
 
for
a
moment
he
forget
that
he
want
to
say
anything
,
or
that
it
be
necessary
to
tell
her
what
he
mean
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dinah
,
"
he
say
suddenly
,
take
both
her
hand
between
his
,
"
I
love
you

whole
heart
and
soul

<EOS>
I
love
you
next
to
God
who

"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
's
lip
become
pale
,
like
her
cheek
,
and
she
tremble
violently
under
the
shock
of
painful
joy
.
<EOS>
Her
hand
be
cold
as
death
between
Adam
's
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
draw
them
away
,
because
he
hold
them
fast
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
tell
me
you
can
not

<EOS>
do
not

pass
our
life
away
from
one
another

"
  
<EOS>
the
tear
be
tremble
in
Dinah
's
eye
,
and
they
fall
before
she
could
answer
.
<EOS>
but
she
speak
in
a
quiet
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
dear
Adam
,
we
must
submit
to
another
Will

We

"
  
<EOS>
"
not

Adam
say
passionately
.
"
<EOS>
tell
me
 
tell
me
if
you
can
love
me
better
than
a
brother

"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
be
too
entirely
reliant
on
the
Supreme
guidance
to
attempt
to
achieve
any
end
by
a
deceptive
concealment
.
<EOS>
She
be
recover
now
from
the
first
shock
of
emotion
,
and
she
look
at
Adam
with
simple
sincere
eye
as
she
say
,
"
yes
,
Adam
,
my
heart
be
draw
strongly
towards
you

and
of
my
own
will

if
I
have
no
clear
showing
to
the
contrary

I
could
find
my
happiness
in
be
near
you
and
minister
to
you
continually
.
<EOS>
I
fear
I
should
forget
to
rejoice
and
weep
with
other
;
nay
,
I
fear
I
should
forget
the
Divine
presence
,
and
seek
no
love

yours

"
  
<EOS>
Adam
do
not
speak
immediately
.
<EOS>
They
sit
look
at
each
other
in
delicious
silence
 
for
the
first
sense
of
mutual
love
exclude
other
feeling
;
it
will
have
the
soul
all
to
itself

<EOS>
"
then
,
Dinah

Adam
say
at
last

how
can
there

great

Can
anything

You

towards

that
your

be
not

mine

the
thought

you
have
take
hold
of
me
,
so
that
my
soul
have
lose
its
freedom

be
become
enslave
to
an
earthly
affection

make
me
anxious

what
should
befall
myself

in
all

I
have
be
content

my

be
begin
to
hunger
after
an
equal

I
have
no

that
I
must
wrestle
against
that

temptation

go
away

no

they
talk
of
other
thing
through
the

of

linger
in

to
look
at
the
great

geese
grazing
,
at

corn

at

through

such

<EOS>
ingenious
philosopher
tell
you
,
perhaps
,
that
the
great
work
of
the
steam
-
engine
be
to
create
leisure
for
mankind
.
<EOS>
do
not
believe
them
:
it
only
create
a
vacuum
for
eager
thought
to
rush
in
.
<EOS>
even
idleness
be
eager
now
 
eager
for
amusement
;
prone
to
excursion
-
train
,
art
museum
,
periodical
literature
,
and
exciting
novel
;
prone
even
to
scientific
theorizing
and
cursory
peep
through

<EOS>
old
Leisure
be
quite
a
different
personage
.
<EOS>
He
only
read
one
newspaper
,
innocent
of
leader
,
and
be
free
from
that
periodicity
of
sensation
which
we
call
post
-
time
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
contemplative
,
rather
stout
gentleman
,
of
excellent
digestion
;
of
quiet
perception
,
undisease
by
hypothesis
;
happy
in
his
inability
to
know
the
cause
of
thing
,
prefer
the
thing
themselves
.
<EOS>
He
live
chiefly
in
the
country
,
among
pleasant
seat
and
homestead
,
and
be
fond
of
sauntering
by
the
fruit
-
tree
wall
and
scent
the
apricot
when
they
be
warm
by
the
morning
sunshine
,
or
of
shelter
himself
under
the
orchard
bough
at
noon
,
when
the
summer
pear
be
fall
.
<EOS>
He
know
nothing
of
weekday
service
,
and
think
none
the
bad
of
the
Sunday
sermon
if
it
allow
him
to
sleep
from
the
text
to
the
blessing
;
like
the
afternoon
service
best
,
because
the
prayer
be
the
short
,
and
not
ashamed
to
say
so
;
for
he
have
an
easy
,
jolly
conscience
,
broad
-
back
like
himself
,
and
able
to
carry
a
great
deal
of
beer
or
port

wine
,
not
be
make
squeamish
by
doubt
and
qualm
and
lofty
aspiration
.
<EOS>
life
be
not
a
task
to
him
,
but
a
sinecure
.
<EOS>
He
finger
the
guinea
in
his
pocket
,
and
eat
his
dinner
,
and
sleep
the
sleep
of
the
irresponsible
,
for
have
he
not
keep
up
his
character
by
go
to
church
on
the
Sunday
afternoon
?
  
<EOS>
fine
old
leisure
!
<EOS>
do
not
be
severe
upon
him
,
and
judge
him
by
our
modern
standard
.
<EOS>
He
never
go
to
Exeter
Hall
,
or
hear
a
popular
preacher
,
or
read
Tracts
for
the
Times
or
Sartor
Resartus

<EOS>
the
Harvest
supper
  
<EOS>
as
Adam
be
go
homeward
,
on
Wednesday
evening
,
in
the
six
o'clock
sunlight
,
he
see
in
the
distance
the
last
load
of
barley
wind
its
way
towards
the
yard
-
gate
of
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
hear
the
chant
of
"
Harvest
Home
!
"
<EOS>
rise
and
sink
like
a
wave
.
<EOS>
Fainter
and
fainter
,
and
more
musical
through
the
grow
distance
,
the
fall
die
sound
still
reach
him
,
as
he
near
the
Willow
Brook
.
<EOS>
the
low
westere
sun
shine
right
on
the
shoulder
of
the
old
Binton
Hills
,
turn
the
unconscious
sheep
into
bright
spot
of
light
;
shone
on
the
window
of
the
cottage
too
,
and
make
them
a
-
flame
with
a
glory
beyond
that
of
amber
or
amethyst
.
<EOS>
It
be
enough
to
make
Adam
feel
that
he
be
in
a
great
temple
,
and
that
the
distant
chant
be
a
sacred
song
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
wonderful
,
"
he
think
,
"
how
that
sound
go
to
one
's
heart
almost
like
a
funeral
bell
,
for
all
it
tell
one
o
'
the
joyfull
time
<EOS>
o
'
the
year
,
and
the
time
when
man
be
mostly
the
thankfull
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
be
a
bit
hard
to
us
to
think
anything
be
over
and
go
in
our
life
;
and
there
be
a
parting
at
the
root
of
all
our
joy
.
<EOS>
It
be
like
what
I
feel
about
Dinah
.
<EOS>
I
should
never
ha
'
come
to
know
that
her
love
'
ud
be
the
great
o
'
blessing
to
me
,
if
what
I
count
a
blessing
have
not
be
wrench
and
tear
away
from
me
,
and
leave
me
with
a
great
need
,
so
as
I
could
crave
and
hunger
for
a
great
and
a
well
comfort
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
expect
to
see
Dinah
again
this
evening
,
and
get
leave
to
accompany
her
as
far
as
Oakbourne
;
and
then
he
would
ask
her
to
fix
some
time
when
he
may
go
to
Snowfield
,
and
learn
whether
the
last
good
hope
that
have
be
bear
to
him
must
be
resign
like
the
rest
.
<EOS>
the
work
he
have
to
do
at
home
,
besides
put
on
his
good
clothe
,
make
it
seven
before
he
be
on
his
way
again
to
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
it
be
questionable
whether
,
with
his
long
and
quick
stride
,
he
should
be
there
in
time
even
for
the
roast
beef
,
which
come
after
the
plum
pudding
,
for
Mrs.
Poyser
's
supper
would
be
punctual
.
  
<EOS>
Great
be
the
clatter
of
knife
and
pewter
plate
and
tin
can
when
Adam
enter
the
house
,
but
there
be
no
hum
of
voice
to
this
accompaniment
<EOS>
:
the
eating
of
excellent
roast
beef
,
provide
free
of
expense
,
be
too
serious
a
business
to
those
good
farm
-
labourer
to
be
perform
with
a
divided
attention
,
even
if
they
have
have
anything
to
say
to
each
other
 
which
they
have
not
.
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Poyser
,
at
the
head
of
the
table
,
be
too
busy
with
his
carving
to
listen
to
Bartle
Massey
's
or
Mr.
Craig
's
ready
talk
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
,
Adam
,
"
say
Mrs.
Poyser
,
who
be
stand
and
look
on
to
see
that
Molly
and
Nancy
do
their
duty
as
waiter
,
"
here
be
a
place
keep
for
you
between
Mr.
Massey
and
the
boy

<EOS>
It
be
a
poor
tale
<EOS>
you
could
not
come
to
see
the
pudding
when
it
be
whole
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
look
anxiously
round
for
a
fourth
woman
's
figure
,
but
Dinah
be
not
there
.
<EOS>
He
be
almost
afraid
of
ask
about
her
;
besides
,
his
attention
be
claim
by
greeting
,
and
there
remain
the
hope
that
Dinah
be
in
the
house
,
though
perhaps
disincline
to
festivity
on
the
eve
of
her
departure
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
goodly
sight
 
that
table
,
with
Martin
Poyser
's
round
good
-
humoured
face
and
large
person
at
the
head
of
it
help
his
servant
to
the
fragrant
roast
beef
and
please
when
the
empty
plate
come
again
.
<EOS>
Martin
,
though
usually
blest
with
a
good
appetite
,
really
forget
to
finish
his
own
beef
to
-
night
 
<EOS>
it
be
so
pleasant
to
him
to
look
on
in
the
interval
of
carving
and
see
how
the
other
enjoy
their
supper
;
for
be
they
not
man
who
,
on
all
the
day
of
the
year
except
Christmas
Day
and
Sundays
,
eat
their
cold
dinner
,
in
a
makeshift
manner
,
under
the
hedgerow
,
and
drank
their
beer
out
of
wooden
bottle
 
with
relish
certainly
,
but
with
their
mouth
towards
the
zenith
,
after
a
fashion
more
endurable
to
duck
than
to
human
biped
.
<EOS>
Martin
Poyser
have
some
faint
conception
of
the
flavour
such
man
must
find
in
hot
roast
beef
and
fresh
-
draw
ale
.
<EOS>
He
hold
his
head
on
one
side
and
screw
up
his
mouth
,
as
he
nudge
Bartle
Massey
,
and
watch
half
-
witted
Tom
Tholer
,
otherwise
know
as
"
Tom
Saft
,
"
receive
his
second
plateful
of
beef
.
<EOS>
a
grin
of
delight
break
over
Tom
's
face
as
the
plate
be
set
down
before
him
,
between
his
knife
and
fork
,
which
he
hold
erect
,
as
if
they
have
be
sacred
taper
.
<EOS>
but
the
delight
be
too
strong
to
continue
smoulder
in
a
grin
 
<EOS>
it
burst
out
the
next
instant
in
a
long
-
draw
"
haw
,
haw
!
"
<EOS>
follow
by
a
sudden
collapse
into
utter
gravity
,
as
the
knife
and
fork
dart
down
on
the
prey
.
<EOS>
Martin
Poyser
's
large
person
shake
with
his
silent
unctuous
laugh
.
<EOS>
He
turn
towards
Mrs.
Poyser
to
see
if
she
too
have
be
observant
of
Tom
,
and
the
eye
of
husband
and
wife
meet
in
a
glance
of
good
-
natured
amusement
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tom
Saft
"
be
a
great
favourite
on
the
farm
,
where
he
play
the
part
of
the
old
jester
,
and
make
up
for
his
practical
deficiency
by
his
success
in
repartee
.
<EOS>
His
hit
,
I
imagine
,
be
those
of
the
flail
,
which
fall
quite
at
random
,
but
nevertheless
smash
an
insect
now
and
then
.
<EOS>
They
be
much
quote
at
sheep
-
shearing
and
haymaking
time
,
but
I
refrain
from
record
them
here
,
lest
Tom
's
wit
should
prove
to
be
like
that
of
many
other
bygone
jester
eminent
in
their
day
 
rather
of
a
temporary
nature
,
not
deal
with
the
deep
and
more
lasting
relation
of
thing
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
except
,
Martin
Poyser
have
some
pride
in
his
servant
and
labourer
,
think
with
satisfaction
that
they
be
the
good
worth
their
pay
of
any
set
on
the
estate
.
<EOS>
there
be
Kester
Bale
,
for
example
(
Beale
,
probably
,
if
the
truth
be
know
,
but
he
be
call
Bale
,
and
be
not
conscious
of
any
claim
to
a
fifth
letter
)
,
the
old
man
with
the
close
leather
cap
and
the
network
of
wrinkle
on
his
sun
-
brown
face
.
<EOS>
be
there
any
man
in
Loamshire
who
know
better
the
"
natur
"
of
all
farming
work
?
<EOS>
He
be
one
of
those
invaluable
labourer
who
can
not
only
turn
their
hand
to
everything
,
but
excel
in
everything
they
turn
their
hand
to
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
<EOS>
Kester
's
knee
be
much
bent
outward
by
this
time
,
and
he
walk
with
a
perpetual
curtsy
,
as
if
he
be
among
the
most
reverent
of
man
.
<EOS>
and
so
he
be
;
but
I
be
oblige
to
admit
that
the
object
of
his
reverence
be
his
own
skill
,
towards
which
he
perform
some
rather
affect
act
of
worship
.
<EOS>
He
always
thatch
the
rick
 
for
if
anything
be
his
forte
more
than
another
,
it
be
thatch
 
and
when
the
last
touch
have
be
put
to
the
last
beehive
rick
,
Kester
,
whose
home
lie
at
some
distance
from
the
farm
,
would
take
a
walk
to
the
rick
-
yard
in
his
good
clothe
on
a
Sunday
morning
and
stand
in
the
lane
,
at
a
due
distance
,
to
contemplate
his
own
thatching
,
walk
about
to
get
each
rick
from
the
proper
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
as
he
curtsy
along
,
with
his
eye
upturned
to
the
straw
knob
imitative
of
golden
globe
at
the
summit
of
the
beehive
rick
,
which
indeed
be
gold
of
the
good
sort
,
you
may
have
imagine
him
to
be
engage
in
some
pagan
act
of
adoration
.
<EOS>
Kester
be
an
old
bachelor
and
repute
to
have
stocking
full
of
coin
,
concern
which
his
master
crack
a
joke
with
him
<EOS>
every
pay
-
night
:
not
a
new
unseasoned
joke
,
but
a
good
old
one
<EOS>
,
that
have
be
try
many
time
before
and
have
wear
well
.
<EOS>
"
th
'
young
measter
be
a
merry
mon
,
"
Kester
frequently
remark
;
for
have
begin
his
career
by
frighten
away
the
crow
under
the
last
Martin
Poyser
but
one
,
he
could
never
cease
to
account
the
reign
Martin
a
young
master
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
ashamed
of
commemorate
old
Kester
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
be
indebted
to
the
hard
hand
of
such
man
 
hand
that
have
long
ago
mingle
with
the
soil
they
till
so
faithfully
,
thriftily
make
the
good
they
could
of
the
earth
's
fruit
,
and
receive
the
small
share
as
their
own
wage
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
at
the
end
of
the
table
,
opposite
his
master
,
there
be
Alick
,
the
shepherd
and
head
-
man
,
with
the
ruddy
face
and
broad
shoulder
,
not
on
the
good
term
with
old
Kester
;
indeed
,
their
intercourse
be
confine
to
an
occasional
snarl
,
for
though
they
probably
differ
little
concern
hedge
and
ditch
and
the
treatment
of
ewes
,
there
be
a
profound
difference
of
opinion
between
them
as
to
their
own
respective
merit
.
<EOS>
when
Tityrus
and
Meliboeus
happen
to
be
on
the
same
farm
,
they
be
not
sentimentally
polite
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
Alick
,
indeed
,
be
not
by
any
mean
a
honeyed
man
.
<EOS>
His
speech
have
usually
something
of
a
snarl
in
it
,
and
his
broad
-
shouldered
aspect
something
of
the
bull
-
dog
expression
 
"
do
not
you
meddle
with
me
,
and
I
will
not
meddle
with
you
.
"
<EOS>
but
he
be
honest
even
to
the
splitting
of
an
oat
-
grain
rather
than
he
would
take
beyond
his
acknowledge
share
,
and
as
"
close
-
fisted
"
with
his
master
's
property
as
if
it
have
be
<EOS>
his
own

very
small
handful
of
damage

because
a
large
handful
affect
his
imagination
painfully
with

sense
of
profusion

<EOS>
good

Tim

waggoner
,
who
love
his

,
have
his
grudge
against
Alick
in
the
matter

<EOS>
They
rarely
speak
to
each
other
,
and
never
look
at
each
other
,
even
over
their
dish
of
cold
potato
;
but
then
,
as
this
be
their
usual
mode
of
behaviour
towards
all
mankind
,
it
would
be
an
unsafe
conclusion
that
they
have
more
than
transient
fit
of
unfriendliness

you
perceive
,
be
not
of
that
entirely
genial
,
merry
,
broad
-
grin
sort
,
apparently
observe
in
most
district
visit
by
artist
.
<EOS>
the
mild
radiance
of
a
smile
be
a
rare
sight
on
a
field
-
labourer
's
face
,
and
there
be
seldom
any
gradation
between
bovine
gravity
and
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
nor
be
every
labourer
so
honest
as
our
friend
Alick
.
<EOS>
at
this
very
table
,
among
Mr.
Poyser
's
man
,
there
be
that
big
Ben
Tholoway
,
a
very
powerful
thresher
,
but
detect
more
than
once
in
carry
away
his
master
's
corn
in
his
pocket
 
an
action
which
,
as
Ben
be
not
a
philosopher
,
could
hardly
be
ascribe
to
absence
of
mind
.
<EOS>
however
,
his
master
have
forgive
him
,
and
continue
to
employ
him
,
for
the
Tholoways
have
live
on
the
common
time
out
of
mind
,
and
have
always
work
for
the
Poysers
.
<EOS>
and
on
the
whole
,
I
daresay
,
society
be
not
much
the
bad
because
Ben
have
not
six
month
of
it
at
the
treadmill
,
for
his
view
of
depredation
be
narrow
,
and
the
House
of
Correction
may
have
enlarge
them
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
Ben
eat
his
roast
beef
to
-
night
with
a
serene
sense
of
have
steal
nothing
more
than
a
few
pea
and
bean
as
seed
for
his
garden
since
the
last
harvest
supper
,
and
feel
warrant
in
think
that
Alick
's
suspicious
eye
,
for
ever
upon
him
,
be
an
injury
to
his
innocence
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
the
roast
beef
be
finish
and
the
cloth
be
draw
,
leave
a
fair
large
deal
table
for
the
bright
drinking
-
can
,
and
the
foam
brown
jug
,
and
the
bright
brass
candlestick
,
pleasant
to
behold
.
<EOS>
now
,
the
great
ceremony
of
the
evening
be
to
begin
 
the
harvest
-
song
,
in
which
every
man
must
join
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
in
tune
,
if
he
like
to
be
singular
,
but
he
must
not
sit
with
closed
lip
.
<EOS>
the
movement
be
oblige
to
be
in
triple
time
;
the
rest
be
ad
libitum
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
origin
of
this
song
 
whether
it
come
in
its
actual
state
from
the
brain
of
a
single
rhapsodist
,
or
be
gradually
perfect
by
a
school
or
succession
of
rhapsodist
,
I
be
ignorant
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
stamp
of
unity
,
of
individual
genius
upon
it
,
which
incline
me
to
the
former
hypothesis
,
though
I
be
not
blind
to
the
consideration
that
this
unity
may
rather
have
arise
from
that
consensus
of
many
mind
which
be
a
condition
of
primitive
thought
,
foreign
to
our
modern
consciousness
.
<EOS>
some
will
perhaps
think
that
they
detect
in
the
first
quatrain
an
indication
of
a
lose
line
,
which
later
rhapsodist
,
fail
in
imaginative
vigour
,
have
supply
by
the
feeble
device
of
iteration
.
<EOS>
other
,
however
,
may
rather
maintain
that
this
very
iteration
be
an
original
felicity
,
to
which
none
but
the
most
prosaic
mind
can
be
insensible
.
  
<EOS>
the
ceremony
connect
with
the
song
be
a
drinking
ceremony
.
<EOS>
(
that
be
perhaps
a
painful
fact
,
but
then
,
you
know
,
we
can
not
reform
our
forefather
.
)
<EOS>
during
the
first
and
second
quatrain
,
sing
decidedly
forte
,
no
can
be
fill
.
       
<EOS>
here
be
a
health
unto
our
master
,
     
<EOS>
the
founder
of
the
feast
;
     
<EOS>
here
be
a
health
unto
our
master
     
<EOS>
and
to
our
mistress
!
       
<EOS>
and
may
his
doing
prosper
,
     
<EOS>
Whate'er
<EOS>
he
take
in
hand
,
     
<EOS>
for
we
be
all
his
servant
,
     
and
be
at
his
command
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
,
immediately
before
the
third
quatrain
or
chorus
,
sung
fortissimo
,
with
emphatic
rap
of
the
table
,
which
give
the
effect
of
cymbal
and
drum
together
,
Alick
's
can
be
fill
,
and
he
be
bind
to
empty
it
before
the
chorus
cease
.
       
<EOS>
then
drink
,
boy
,
drink
!
     
<EOS>
and
see
ye
do
not
spill
,
     
<EOS>
for
if
ye
do
,
ye
shall
drink
two
,
     
<EOS>
for
'
tis
our
master
's
will
.
  
<EOS>
when
Alick
have
go
successfully
through
this
test
of
steady
-
handed
manliness
,
it
be
the
turn
of
old
Kester
,
at
his
right
hand
 
<EOS>
and
so
on
,
till
every
man
have
drink
his
initiatory
pint
under
the
stimulus
of
the
chorus
.
<EOS>
Tom
Saft
 
<EOS>
the
rogue
 
take
care
to
spill
a
little
by
accident
;
but
Mrs.
Poyser
(
too
officiously
,
Tom
think
)
interfere
to
prevent
the
exaction
of
the
penalty
.
  
<EOS>
to
any
listener
outside
the
door
it
would
have
be
the
reverse
of
obvious
why
the
"
drink
,
boy
,
drink
!
"
<EOS>
should
have
such
an
immediate
and
often
-
repeat
encore
;
but
once
enter
,
he
would
have
see
that
all
face
be
at
present
sober
,
and
most
of
them
serious
 
<EOS>
it
be
the
regular
and
respectable
thing
for
those
excellent
farm
-
labourer
to
do
,
as
much
as
for
elegant
lady
and
gentleman
to
smirk
and
bow
over
their
wine
-
glass
.
<EOS>
Bartle
Massey
,
whose
ear
be
rather
sensitive
,
have
go
out
to
see
what
sort
of
evening
it
be
at
an
early
stage
in
the
ceremony
,
and
have
not
finish
his
contemplation
until
a
silence
of
five
minute
declare
that
"
drink
,
boy
,
drink
!
"
<EOS>
be
not
likely
to
begin
again
for
the
next
twelvemonth
.
<EOS>
much
to
the
regret
of
the
boy
and
Totty
:
on
them
the
stillness
fall
rather
flat
,
after
that
glorious
thumping
of
the
table
,
towards
which
Totty
,
seat
on
her
father
's
knee
,
contribute
with
her
small
might
and
small
fist
.
  
<EOS>
when
Bartle
re
-
enter
,
however
,
there
appear
to
be
a
general
desire
for
solo
music
after
the
choral
.
<EOS>
Nancy
declare
that
Tim
the
waggoner
know
a
song
and
be
"
allay
singe
like
a
lark
<EOS>
i
'
the
stable
,
"
whereupon
Mr.
Poyser
say
encouragingly
,
"
<EOS>
come
,
Tim
,
lad
,
let
's
hear
it
.
"
<EOS>
Tim
look
sheepish
,
tuck
down
his
head
,
and
say
he
could
not
sing
,
but
this
encourage
invitation
of
the
master
's
be
echo
all
round
the
table
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
conversational
opportunity
:
everybody
could
say
,
"
come
,
Tim
,
"
except
Alick
,
who
never
relax
into
the
frivolity
of
unnecessary
speech
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
Tim
's
next
neighbour
,
Ben
Tholoway
,
begin
to
give
emphasis
to
his
speech
by
nudge
,
at
which
Tim
,
grow
rather
savage
,
say
,
"
let
me
alooan
,
will
ye
?
<EOS>
else
I
will

"
<EOS>
a
good

tempered
waggoner
's
patience
have
limit
,
and
Tim
be
not
to
be
urge
further
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
David
,
ye're
the
lad
to
sing

Ben
,
willing
to
show
that
he
be
not
discomfit
by
this
check
.
<EOS>
"
sing
"
My
loove
be
a
roos
wi'out
a
thorn

"
<EOS>
"
  
the
amatory
David
be
a
young
man
of
an
unconscious
abstract
expression
,
which
be
due
probably
to
a
squint
of
superior
intensity
rather
than
to
any
mental
characteristic
;
for
he
be
not
indifferent
to
Ben
's
invitation
,
but
blush
and
laugh
and
rub
his
sleeve
over
his
mouth
in
a
way
that
be
regard
as
a
symptom
of
yield
.
<EOS>
and
for
some
time
the
company
appear
to
be
much
in
earnest
about
the
desire
to
hear
David
's
song
.
<EOS>
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
the
lyricism
of
the
evening
be
in
the
cellar
at
present
,
and
be
not
to
be
draw
from
that
retreat
just
yet
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
the
conversation
at
the
head
of
the
table
have
take
a
political
turn
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Craig
be
not
above
talk
politic
occasionally
,
though
he
pique
himself
rather
on
a
wise
insight
than
on
specific
information
.
<EOS>
He
see
so
far
beyond
the
mere
fact
of
a
case
that
really
it
be
superfluous
to
know
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
I

though
I
may
read

Miss

there

sit

i

pretty
nigh
from

He

this

Mr.

Mr.
Irwine
's
testimony
be
not
to

but
,
on

hand
,
Craig
be
a

his

less
startling

Martin

never

for

<EOS>
Mr.

have
find
no

such
as

in

a

draught

down

at

Mrs.

would
probably
have
bring
her
rejoinder
to
a
further
climax

if
every
one

attention

complex

Tim

slightly
of

impel
to
supersede

feeble
buzz

Three
Merry

David
be
not
to
be
put
down
so
easily
,
and
show
himself
capable
of
a
copious
crescendo
,
which
be
render
it
doubtful
whether
the
rose
would
not
predominate
over
the
mower
,
when
old
Kester
,
with
an
entirely
unmoved

immovable

suddenly
set
up
a
quavering
treble

<EOS>
the

take
this
form
of
vocal
entertainment
very
much
as
a
matter
of
course

free
from

prejudice

Bartle
Massey
lay
down
his
pipe

put
his

in

haste

hope
rather
than
discouragement
from
it

She
be
fearful
lest
the
strength
of
her

towards

should
hinder
her
from
wait
and
listen
faithfully
for
the
ultimate
guiding

<EOS>
and
yet
even
that
may
disturb
her
a

perhaps

<EOS>
She
want
to
be
quite
quiet
in
her
old
way
for
a

not
a

one

and
mean
another

<EOS>
I
will
wait
patiently
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
that
be
Adam
's
wise
resolution
,
and
it
throve
excellently
for
the
first
two
or
three
week
on
the
nourishment
it
get
from
the
remembrance
of
Dinah
's
confession
that
Sunday
afternoon
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
wonderful
amount
of
sustenance
in
the
first
few
word
of
love
.
<EOS>
but
towards
the
middle
of
October
the
resolution
begin
to
dwindle
perceptibly
,
and
show
dangerous
symptom
of
exhaustion
.
<EOS>
the
week
be
unusually
long
:
Dinah
must
surely
have
have
more
than
enough
time
to
make
up
her
mind
.
<EOS>
let
a
woman
say
what
she
will
after
she
have
once
tell
a
man
that
she
love
him
,
he
be
a
little
too
flushed
and
exalt
with
that
first
draught
<EOS>
she
offer
him
to
care
much
about
the
taste
of
the
second
.
<EOS>
He
tread
the
earth
with
a
very
elastic
step
as
he
walk
away
from
her
,
and
make
light
of
all
difficulty
.
<EOS>
but
that
sort
of
glow
die
out
:
memory
get
sadly
dilute
with
time
,
and
be
not
strong
enough
to
revive
us
.
<EOS>
Adam
be
no
longer
so
confident
as
he
have
be
.
<EOS>
He
begin
to
fear
that
perhaps
Dinah
's
old
life
would
have
too
strong
a
grasp
upon
her
for
any
new
feeling
to
triumph
.
<EOS>
if
she
have
not
feel
this
,
she
would
surely
have
write
to
him
to
give
him
some
comfort
;
but
it
appear
that
she
hold
it
right
to
discourage
him
.
<EOS>
as
Adam
's
confidence
wane
,
his
patience
wane
with
it
,
and
he
think
he
must
write
himself
.
<EOS>
He
must
ask
Dinah
not
to
leave
him
in
painful
doubt
longer
than
be
needful
.
<EOS>
He
sit
up
late
one
night
to
write
her
a
letter
,
but
the
next
morning
he
burn
it
,
afraid
of
its
effect
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
bad
to
have
a
discouraging
answer
by
letter
than
from
her
own
lip
,
for
her
presence
reconcile
him
to
her
will
.
  
<EOS>
You
perceive
how
it
be
:
<EOS>
Adam
be
hunger
for
the
sight
of
Dinah
,
and
when
that
sort
of
hunger
reach
a
certain
stage
,
a
lover
be
likely
to
still
it
though
he
may
have
to
put
his
future
in
pawn
.
  
<EOS>
but
what
harm
could
he
do
by
go
to
Snowfield
?
<EOS>
Dinah
could
not
be
displeased
with
him
for
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
forbid
him
to
go
.
<EOS>
She
must
surely
expect
that
he
would
go
before
long
.
<EOS>
by
the
second
Sunday
in
October
this
view
of
the
case
have
become
so
clear
to
Adam
that
he
be
already
on
his
way
to
Snowfield
,
on
horseback
this
time
,
for
his
hour
be
precious
now
,
and
he
have
borrow
Jonathan
Burge
's
good
nag
for
the
journey
.
  
<EOS>
what
keen
memory
go
along
the
road
with
him
!
<EOS>
He
have
often
be
to
Oakbourne
and
back
since
that
first
journey
to
Snowfield
,
but
beyond
Oakbourne
the
greystone
wall
,
<EOS>
the
broken
country
,
the
meagre
tree
,
seem
to
be
tell
him
afresh
the
story
of
that
painful
past
which
he
know
so
well
by
heart
.
<EOS>
but
no
story
be
the
same
to
us
after
a
lapse
of
time
 
or
rather
,
we
who
read
it
be
no
longer
the
same
interpreter
 
and
Adam
<EOS>
this
morning
bring
with
him
new
thought
through
that
grey
country
,
thought
which
give
an
altered
significance
to
its
story
of
the
past
.
  
<EOS>
that
be
a
base
and
selfish
,
even
a
blasphemous
,
spirit
which
rejoice
and
be
thankful
over
the
past
evil
that
have
blight
or
crush
another
,
because
it
have
be
make
a
source
of
unforeseen
good
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
Adam
could
never
cease
to
mourn
over
that
mystery
of
human
sorrow
which
have
be
bring
so
close
to
him
;
he
could
never
thank
God
for
another
's
misery
.
<EOS>
and
if
I
be
capable
of
that
narrow
-
sighted
joy
in
Adam
's
behalf
,
I
should
still
know
he
be
not
the
man
to
feel
it
for
himself
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
shake
his
head
at
such
a
sentiment
and
say
,
"
Evil
's
evil
,
and
sorrow
's
sorrow
,
and
you
can
not
alter
it
be
natur
by
wrap
it
up
in
other
word
.
<EOS>
other
folk
be
not
create
for
my
sake
,
that
I
should
think
all
square
when
thing
turn
out
well
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
ignoble
to
feel
that
the
full
life
which
a
sad
experience
have
bring
us
be
worth
our
own
personal
share
of
pain
.
<EOS>
surely
it
be
not
possible
to
feel
otherwise
,
any
more
than
it
would
be
possible
for
a
man
with
cataract
to
regret
the
painful
process
by
which
his
dim
blur
sight
of
man
as
tree
walk
have
be
exchange
for
clear
outline
and
effulgent
day
.
<EOS>
the
growth
of
high
feeling
within
us
be
like
the
growth
of
faculty
,
bring
with
it
a
sense
of
add
strength
.
<EOS>
We
can
no
more
wish
to
return
to
a
narrow
sympathy
than
a
painter
or
a
musician
can
wish
to
return
to
his
cruder
manner
,
or
a
philosopher
to
his
less
complete
formula
.
  
<EOS>
something
like
this
sense
of
enlarge
being
be
in
Adam
's
mind
this
Sunday
morning
,
as
he
ride
along
in
vivid
recollection
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
His
feeling
towards
Dinah
,
the
hope
of
pass
his
life
with
her
,
have
be
the
distant
unseen
point
towards
which
that
hard
journey
from
Snowfield
eighteen
month
ago
have
be
lead
him
.
<EOS>
Tender
and
deep
as
his
love
for
Hetty
have
be
 
so
deep
that
the
root
of
it
would
never
be
tear
away
 
<EOS>
his
love
for
Dinah
be
well
and
more
precious
to
him
,
for
it
be
the
outgrowth
of
that
full
life
which
have
come
to
him
from
his
acquaintance
with
deep
sorrow
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
like
as
if
it
be
a
new
strength
to
me
,
"
he
say
to
himself
,
"
to
love
her
and
know
as
she
love
me
.
<EOS>
I
shall
look
t
'
her
to
help
me
to
see
thing
right
.
<EOS>
for
she
be
well
than
I
be
 
<EOS>
there
be
less
o
'
self
in
her
,
and
pride
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
a
feeling
as
give
you
a
sort
o
'
liberty
,
as
if
you
could
walk
more
fearless
,
when
you
have
more
trust
in
another
than
y
'
have
in
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
be
think
I
know
better
than
them
as
belong
to
me
,
and
that
be
a
poor
sort
o
'
<EOS>
life
,
when
you
can
not
look
to
them
near
to
you
t
'
help
you
with
a
bit
better
think
than
what
you
have
get
inside
you
a'ready
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
more
than
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
when
Adam
come
in
sight
of
the
grey
town
on
the
hill
-
side
and
look
searchingly
towards
the
green
valley
below
,
for
the
first
glimpse
of
the
old
thatched
roof
near
the
ugly
red
mill
.
<EOS>
the
scene
look
less
harsh
in
the
soft
October
sunshine
than
it
have
in
the
eager
time
of
early
spring
,
and
the
one
grand
charm
it
possess
in
common
with
all
wide
-
stretch
woodless
region
 
that
it
fill
you
with
a
new
consciousness
of
the
overarching
sky
 
have
a
milder
,
more
soothing
influence
than
usual
,
on
this
almost
cloudless
day
.
<EOS>
Adam
's
doubt
and
fear
melt
under
this
influence
as
the
delicate
weblike
cloud
have
gradually
melt
away
into
the
clear
blue
above
him
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
see
Dinah
's
gentle
face
assure
him
,
with
its
look
alone
,
of
all
he
long
to
know
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
expect
Dinah
to
be
at
home
at
this
hour
,
but
he
get
down
from
his
horse
and
tie
it
at
the
little
gate
,
that
he
may
ask
where
she
be
go
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
He
have
set
his
mind
on
follow
her
and
bring
her
home
.
<EOS>
She
be
go
to
Sloman
's
end
,
a
hamlet
about
three
mile
off
,
over
the
hill
,
the
old
woman
tell
him
 
have
set
off
directly
after
morning
chapel
,
to
preach
in
a
cottage
there
,
as
her
habit
be
.
<EOS>
anybody
at
the
town
would
tell
him
the
way
to
Sloman
's
end
.
<EOS>
so
Adam
get
on
his
horse
again
and
ride
to
the
town
,
put
up
at
the
old
inn
and
take
a
hasty
dinner
there
in
the
company
of
the
too
chatty
landlord
,
from
whose
friendly
question
and
reminiscence
he
be
glad
to
escape
as
soon
as
possible
and
set
out
towards
Sloman
's
end
.
<EOS>
with
all
his
haste
it
be
nearly
four
o'clock
before
he
could
set
off
,
and
he
think
that
as
Dinah
have
go
so
early
,
she
would
perhaps
already
be
near
return
.
<EOS>
the
little
,
grey
,
desolate
-
look
hamlet
,
unscreened
by
shelter
tree
,
lie
in
sight
long
before
he
reach
it
,
and
as
he
come
near
he
could
hear
the
sound
of
voice
singe
a
hymn
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
perhaps
that
be
the
last
hymn
before
they
come
away
,
"
Adam
think
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
walk
back
a
bit
and
turn
again
to
meet
her
,
farther
off
the
village
.
"
<EOS>
He
walk
back
till
he
get
nearly
to
the
top
of
the
hill
again
,
and
seat
himself
on
a
loose
stone
,
against
the
low
wall
,
to
watch
till
he
should
see
the
little
black
figure
leave
the
hamlet
and
wind
up
the
hill
.
<EOS>
He
choose
this
spot
,
almost
at
the
top
of
the
hill
,
because
it
be
away
from
all
eye
 
<EOS>
no
house
,
no
cattle
,
not
even
a
nibble
sheep
near
 
no
presence
but
the
still
light
and
shadow
and
the
great
embracing
sky
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
much
longer
come
than
he
expect
.
<EOS>
He
wait
an
hour
at
least
watch
for
her
and
think
of
her
,
while
the
afternoon
shadow
lengthen
and
the
light
grow
soft
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
see
the
little
black
figure
come
from
between
the
grey
house
and
gradually
approach
the
foot
of
the
hill
.
<EOS>
slowly
,
Adam
think
,
but
Dinah
be
really
walk
at
her
usual
pace
,
with
a
light
quiet
step
.
<EOS>
now
she
be
begin
to
wind
along
the
path
up
the
hill
,
but
Adam
would
not
move
yet
;
he
would
not
meet
her
too
soon
;
he
have
set
his
heart
on
meet
her
in
this
assure
loneliness
.
<EOS>
and
now
he
begin
to
fear
lest
he
should
startle
her
too
much
.
"
<EOS>
yet
,
"
he
think
,
"
she
be
not
one
to
be
overstartle
;
she
be
always
so
calm
and
quiet
,
as
if
she
be
prepare
for
anything
.
"
  
<EOS>
what
be
she
think
of
as
she
wind
up
the
hill
?
<EOS>
perhaps
she
have
find
complete
repose
without
him
,
and
have
cease
to
feel
any
need
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
on
the
verge
of
a
decision
we
all
tremble
:
hope
pause
with
flutter
wing
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
at
last
she
be
very
near
,
and
Adam
rise
from
the
stone
wall
.
<EOS>
It
happen
that
just
as
he
walk
forward
,
Dinah
have
pause
and
turn
round
to
look
back
at
the
village
 
who
do
not
pause
and
look
back
in
mount
a
hill
?
<EOS>
Adam
be
glad
,
for
,
with
the
fine
instinct
of
a
lover
,
he
feel
that
it
would
be
good
for
her
to
hear
his
voice
before
she
see
him
.
<EOS>
He
come
within
three
pace
of
her
and
then
say
,
"
Dinah
!
"
<EOS>
She
start
without
look
round
,
as
if
she
connect
the
sound
with
no
place
.
"
<EOS>
Dinah
!
"
<EOS>
Adam
say
again
.
<EOS>
He
know
quite
well
what
be
in
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
accustomed
to
think
of
impression
as
purely
spiritual
monition
that
she
look
for
no
material
visible
accompaniment
of
the
voice
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
second
time
she
look
round
.
<EOS>
what
a
look
of
yearn
love
it
be
that
the
mild
grey
eye
turn
on
the
strong
dark
-
eyed
man
!
<EOS>
She
do
not
start
again
at
the
sight
of
him
;
she
say
nothing
,
but
move
towards
him
so
that
his
arm
could
clasp
her
round
.
  
<EOS>
and
they
walk
on
so
in
silence
,
while
the
warm
tear
fall
.
<EOS>
Adam
be
content
,
and
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
It
be
Dinah
who
speak
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
Adam
,
"
she
say
,
"
it
be
the
Divine
Will
.
<EOS>
My
soul
be
so
knit
to
yours
that
it
be
but
<EOS>
a
divided
life
I
live
without
you
.
<EOS>
and
this
moment
,
now
you
be
with
me
,
and
I
feel
that
our
heart
be
fill
with
the
same
love
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
fulness
of
strength
to
bear
and
do
our
heavenly
Father
's
Will
that
I
have
lose
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
pause
and
look
into
her
sincere
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
we
will
never
part
any
more
,
Dinah
,
till
death
part
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
they
kiss
each
other
with
a
deep
joy
.
  
<EOS>
what
great
thing
be
there
for
two
human
soul
than
to
feel
that
they
be
join
for
life
 
to
strengthen
each
other
in
all
labour
,
to
rest
on
each
other
in
all
sorrow
,
to
minister
to
each
other
in
all
pain
,
to
be
one
with
each
other
in
silent
unspeakable
memory
at
the
moment
of
the
last
parting

<EOS>
marriage
bell
  
<EOS>
in
little
more
than
a
month
after
that
meeting
on
the
hill
 
on
a
rimy
morning
in
depart
November
 
Adam
and
Dinah
be
married
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
an
event
much
thought
of
in
the
village
.
<EOS>
all
Mr.
Burge
's
man
have
a
holiday
,
and
all
Mr.
Poyser
's
,
and
most
of
those
who
have
a
holiday
appear
in
their
good
clothe
at
the
wedding
.
<EOS>
I
think
there
be
hardly
an
inhabitant
of
Hayslope
specially
mention
in
this
history
and
still
resident
in
the
parish
on
this
November
morning
who
be
not
either
in
church
to
see
Adam
and
Dinah
marry
,
or
near
the
church
door
to
greet
them
as
they
come
forth
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Irwine
and
her
daughter
be
wait
at
the
churchyard
gate
in
their
carriage
(
for
they
have
a
carriage
now
)
to
shake
hand
with
the
bride
and
bridegroom
and
wish
them
well
;
and
in
the
absence
of
Miss
Lydia
Donnithorne
at
Bath
,
Mrs.
Best
,
Mr.
Mills
,
and
Mr.
Craig
have
feel
it
incumbent
on
them
to
represent
"
the
family
"
at
the
Chase
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
the
churchyard
walk
be
quite
line
with
familiar
face
,
many
of
them
face
that
have
first
look
at
Dinah
when
she
preach
on
the
Green
.
<EOS>
and
no
wonder
they
show
this
eager
interest
on
her
marriage
morning
,
for
nothing
like
Dinah
and
the
history
which
have
bring
her
and
<EOS>
Adam
Bede
together
have
be
know
at
Hayslope
within
the
memory
of
man
.
  
<EOS>
Bessy
Cranage
,
in
her
neatest
cap
and
frock
,
be
cry
,
though
she
do
not
exactly
know
why
;
for
,
as
her
cousin
Wiry
Ben
,
who
stand
near
her
,
judiciously
suggest
,
Dinah
be
not
go
away
,
and
if
Bessy
be
in
low
spirit
,
the
good
thing
for
her
to
do
be
to
follow
Dinah
's
example
and
marry
an
honest
fellow
who
be
ready
to
have
her
.
<EOS>
next
to
Bessy
,
just
within
the
church
door
,
there
be
the
Poyser
child
,
peep
round
the
corner
of
the
pew
to
get
a
sight
of
the
mysterious
ceremony
;
Totty
's
face
wear
an
unusual
air
of
anxiety
at
the
idea
of
see
cousin
Dinah
come
back
look
rather
old
,
for
in
Totty
's
experience
no
married
people
be
young
.
  
<EOS>
I
envy
them
all
the
sight
they
have
when
the
marriage
be
fairly
end
and
Adam
lead
Dinah
out
of
church
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
in
black
this
morning
,
for
her
Aunt
Poyser
would
by
no
mean
allow
such
a
risk
of
incur
bad
luck
,
and
have
herself
make
a
present
of
the
wedding
dress
,
make
all
of
grey
,
though
in
the
usual
Quaker
form
,
for
on
this
point
Dinah
could
not
give
way
.
<EOS>
so
the
lily
face
look
out
with
sweet
gravity
from
under
a
grey
Quaker
bonnet
,
neither
smile
nor
blush
,
but
with
lip
tremble

<EOS>
Adam
,
as
he
press
her
arm
to
his
side
,
walk
with
his
old
erectness
and
his
head
throw
rather
backward
as
if
to
face
all
the
world
better
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
because
he
be
particularly
proud
this
morning
,
as
be
the
will
not
of
bridegroom
,
for
his
happiness
be
of
a
kind
that
have
little
reference
to
man
's
opinion
of
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
tinge
of
sadness
in
his
deep
joy
;
Dinah
know
it
,
and
do
not
feel
aggrieved

<EOS>
there

three
other

Bartle

,
with
Lisbeth
 
Lisbeth
in
a
new
gown
and

,
too
busy
with
her
pride
in
her
son
and
her
delight
in
possess
the
one
daughter
she
have
desire
to
devise
a
single
pretext
for
complaint
.
  
<EOS>
Bartle
Massey
have
consent
to
attend
the
wedding
at
Adam
's
earnest
request
,
under
protest
against
marriage
in
general
and
the
marriage
of
a
sensible
man
in
particular
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
Mr.
Poyser
have
a
joke
against
him
after
the
wedding
dinner
,
to
the
effect
that
in
the
vestry
he
have
give
the
bride
one
more
kiss
than
be
necessary
.
  
<EOS>
behind
this
last
couple

Mr.
Irwine
,
glad
at
heart
over
this
good
morning
's
work
of

<EOS>
for
he
have
see
Adam
in
the
bad
moment
of
his
sorrow
;
and
what
well
harvest
from
that
painful
seed
-
time
could
there
be
than
this
?
<EOS>
the
love
that
have
bring
hope
and
comfort
in
the
hour
of
despair
,
the
love
that
have
find
its
way
to
the
dark
prison
cell
and
to
poor
Hetty
's
darker
soul
 
<EOS>
this
strong
gentle
love
be
to
be
Adam

companion
and
helper
till

much
shake

with
"

for
the

unwonted
vivacity
of
tongue
,
for
he

all
the
appropriate
wedding

joke
at
his
command

<EOS>
and
the
woman
,
he
observe
,
could
never
do
anything
but
put
finger
in
eye
at
a
wedding
.
<EOS>
even
Mrs.
Poyser
could
not
trust
herself
to
speak
as
the
neighbour

Lisbeth

on
with
some
contempt
at
these
informal
greeting
which
require
no
official
co

operation
from
the
clerk
,
begin
to
hum
in
his
musical
bass
,
"
oh
what
a
joyful
thing

be
,
"
by
way
of
prelude
a
little
to
the
effect
he
intend
to
produce
in
the
wedding
psalm
next
Sunday

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
We
