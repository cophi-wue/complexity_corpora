before
the
reader
be
introduce
to
the
modest
country
medical
practitioner
who
be
to
be
the
chief
personage
of
the
follow
tale
,
it
will
be
well
that
he
should
be
make
acquainted
with
some
particular
as
to
the
locality
in
which
,
and
the
neighbour
among
whom
,
our
doctor
follow
his
profession
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
county
in
the
west
of
England
not
so
full
of
life
,
indeed
,
nor
so
widely
spoken
of
as
some
of
its
manufacturing
leviathan
brother
in
the
north
,
but
which
be
,
nevertheless
,
very
dear
to
those
who
know
it
well
.
<EOS>
Its
green
pasture
,
its
wave
wheat
,
its
deep
and
shady
and
 
<EOS>
let
us
add
 
dirty
lane
,
its
path
and
stile
,
its
tawny
-
colour
,
well
-
build
rural
church
,
its
avenue
of
beech
,
and
frequent
Tudor
mansion
,
its
constant
county
hunt
,
its
social
grace
,
and
the
general
air
of
clanship
which
pervade
it
,
have
make
it
to
its
own
inhabitant
a
favour
land
of
Goshen
.
<EOS>
It
be
purely
agricultural
;
agricultural
in
its
produce
,
agricultural
in
its
poor
,
and
agricultural
in
its
pleasure
.
<EOS>
there
be
town
in
it
,
of
course
;
dépôts
from
whence
be
bring
seed
and
grocery
,
ribbon
and
fire
-
shovel
;
in
which
market
be
hold
and
county
ball
be
carry
on
;
which
return
member
to
Parliament
,
generally
 
in
spite
of
Reform
Bills
,
past
,
present
,
and
come
 
in
accordance
with
the
dictate
of
some
neighbour
land
magnate
:
from
whence
emanate
the
country
postman
,
and
where
be
locate
the
supply
of
post
-
horse
necessary
for
county
visiting
.
<EOS>
but
these
town
add
nothing
to
the
importance
of
the
county
;
they
consist
,
with
the
exception
of
the
assize
town
,
of
dull
,
all
but
death
-
like
single
street
.
<EOS>
each
possess
two
pump
,
three
hotel
,
ten
shop
,
fifteen
beer
-
house
,
a
beadle
,
and
a
market
-
place
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
town
population
of
the
county
reckon
for
nothing
when
the
importance
of
the
county
be
discuss
,
with
the
exception
,
as
before
say
,
of
the
assize
town
,
which
be
also
a
cathedral
city
.
<EOS>
Herein
be
a
clerical
aristocracy
,
which
be
certainly
not
without
its
due
weight
.
<EOS>
a
resident
bishop
,
a
resident
dean
,
an
archdeacon
,
three
or
four
resident
prebendary
,
and
all
their
numerous
chaplain
,
vicar
,
and
ecclesiastical
satellite
,
do
make
up
a
society
sufficiently
powerful
to
be
count
as
something
by
the
county
squirearchy
.
<EOS>
in
other
respect
the
greatness
of
Barsetshire
depend
wholly
on
the
land
power
.
  
<EOS>
Barsetshire
,
however
,
be
not
now
so
essentially
one
whole
as
it
be
before
the
Reform
Bill
divide
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
in
these
day
an
East
Barsetshire
,
and
there
be
a
West
Barsetshire
;
and
people
conversant
with
Barsetshire
doing
declare
that
they
can
already
decipher
some
difference
of
feeling
,
some
division
of
interest
.
<EOS>
the
eastern
moiety
of
the
county
be
more
purely
conservative
than
the
western
;
there
be
,
or
be
,
a
taint
of
Peelism
in
the
latter
;
and
then
,
too
,
the
residence
of
two
such
great
Whig
magnate
as
the
Duke
of
Omnium
and
the
Earl
de
Courcy
in
that
locality
in
some
degree
overshadow
and
render
less
influential
the
gentleman
who
live
near
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
to
East
Barsetshire
that
we
be
call
.
<EOS>
when
the
division
above
speak
of
be
first
contemplate
,
in
those
stormy
day
in
which
gallant
man
be
still
combat
reform
minister
,
if
not
with
hope
,
still
with
spirit
,
the
battle
be
fight
by
none
more
bravely
than
by
John
Newbold
Gresham
of
Greshamsbury
,
the
member
for
Barsetshire
.
<EOS>
fate
,
however
,
and
the
Duke
of
Wellington
be
adverse
,
and
in
the
follow
Parliament
John
Newbold
Gresham
be
only
member
for
East
Barsetshire
.
  
<EOS>
whether
or
not
it
be
true
,
as
state
at
the
time
,
that
the
aspect
of
the
man
with
whom
he
be
call
on
to
associate
at
St
Stephen
's
break
his
heart
,
it
be
not
for
us
now
to
inquire
.
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
true
that
he
do
not
live
to
see
the
first
year
of
the
reform
Parliament
bring
to
a
close
.
<EOS>
the
then
Mr
Gresham
be
not
an
old
man
at
the
time
of
his
death
,
and
his
eld
son
,
Francis
Newbold
Gresham
,
be
a
very
young
man
;
but
,
notwithstanding
his
youth
,
and
notwithstanding
other
ground
of
objection
which
stand
in
the
way
of
such
preferment
,
and
which
must
be
explain
,
he
be
choose
in
his
father
's
place
.
<EOS>
the
father
's
service
have
be
too
recent
,
too
well
appreciated
,
too
thoroughly
in
unison
with
the
feeling
of
those
around
him
to
allow
of
any
other
choice
;
and
in
this
way
young
Frank
Gresham
find
himself
member
for
East
Barsetshire
,
although
the
very
man
who
elect
him
know
that
they
have
but
slend
ground
for
trust
him
with
their
suffrage
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
Gresham
,
though
then
only
twenty
-
four
year
of
age
,
be
a
married
man
,
and
a
father
.
<EOS>
He
have
already
choose
a
wife
,
and
by
his
choice
have
give
much
ground
of
distrust
to
the
man
of
East
Barsetshire
.
<EOS>
He
have
marry
no
other
than
Lady
Arabella
de
Courcy
,
the
sister
of
the
great
Whig
earl
who
live
at
Courcy
Castle
in
the
west
;
that
earl
who
not
only
vote
for
the
Reform
Bill
,
but
have
be
infamously
active
in
bring
over
other
young
peer
so
to
vote
,
and
whose
name
therefore
stank
in
the
nostril
of
the
staunch
Tory
squire
of
the
county
.
  
<EOS>
not
only
have
Frank
Gresham
so
wed
,
but
have
thus
improperly
and
unpatriotically
choose
a
wife
,
he
have
add
to
his
sin
by
become
recklessly
intimate
with
his
wife
's
relation
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
he
still
call
himself
a
Tory
,
belong
to
the
club
of
which
his
father
have
be
one
of
the
most
honoured
member
,
and
in
the
day
of
the
great
battle
get
his
head
break
in
a
row
,
on
the
right
side
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
it
be
feel
by
the
good
man
,
true
and
blue
,
of
East
Barsetshire
,
that
a
constant
sojourner
at
Courcy
Castle
could
not
be
regard
as
a
consistent
Tory
.
<EOS>
when
,
however
,
his
father
die
,
that
broken
head
serve
him
in
good
stead
:
his
suffering
in
the
cause
be
make
the
most
of
;
these
,
in
unison
with
his
father
's
merit
,
turn
the
scale
,
and
it
be
accordingly
decide
,
at
a
meeting
hold
at
the
George
and
Dragon
,
at
Barchester
,
that
Frank
Gresham
should
fill
his
father
's
shoe
.
  
<EOS>
but
Frank
Gresham
could
not
fill
his
father
's
shoe
;
they
be
too
big
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
do
become
member
for
East
Barsetshire
,
but
he
be
such
a
member
 
<EOS>
so
lukewarm
,
so
indifferent
,
so
prone
to
associate
with
the
enemy
of
the
good
cause
,
so
little
willing
to
fight
the
good
fight
,
that
he
soon
disgust
those
who
most
dearly
love
the
memory
of
the
old
squire
.
  
<EOS>
De
Courcy
Castle
in
those
day
have
great
allurement
for
a
young
man
,
and
all
those
allurement
be
make
the
most
of
to
win
over
young
Gresham
.
<EOS>
His
wife
,
who
be
a
year
or
two
old
than
himself
,
be
a
fashionable
woman
,
with
thorough
Whig
taste
and
aspiration
,
such
as
become
the
daughter
of
a
great
Whig
earl
;
she
care
for
politic
,
or
think
that
she
care
for
them
,
more
than
her
husband
do
;
for
a
month
or
two
previous
to
her
engagement
she
have
be
attach
to
the
Court
,
and
have
be
make
to
believe
that
much
of
the
policy
of
England
's
ruler
depend
on
the
political
intrigue
of
England
's
woman
.
<EOS>
She
be
one
who
would
fain
be
do
something
if
she
only
know
how
,
and
the
first
important
attempt
she
make
be
to
turn
her
respectable
young
Tory
husband
into
a
second
-
rate
Whig
bantling
.
<EOS>
as
this
lady
's
character
will
,
it
be
hope
,
show
itself
in
the
follow
page
<EOS>
,
we
need
not
now
describe
it
more
closely
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
bad
thing
to
be
son
-
in
-
law
to
a
potent
earl
,
member
of
Parliament
for
a
county
,
and
a
possessor
of
a
fine
old
english
seat
,
and
a
fine
old
english
fortune
.
<EOS>
as
a
very
young
man
,
Frank
Gresham
find
the
life
to
which
he
be
thus
introduce
agreeable
enough
.
<EOS>
He
console
himself
as
best
he
may
for
the
blue
look
with
which
he
be
greet
by
his
own
party
,
and
take
his
revenge
by
consort
more
thoroughly
than
ever
with
his
political
adversary
.
<EOS>
foolishly
,
like
a
foolish
moth
,
he
fly
to
the
bright
light
,
and
,
like
the
moth
,
of
course
he
burn
his
wing
.
<EOS>
early
in
1833
he
have
become
a
member
of
Parliament
,
and
in
the
autumn
of
1834
the
dissolution
come
.
<EOS>
young
member
of
three
or
four
-
and
-
twenty
do
not
think
much
of
dissolution
,
forget
the
fancy
of
their
constituent
,
and
be
too
proud
of
the
present
to
calculate
much
as
to
the
future
.
<EOS>
so
it
be
with
Mr
Gresham
.
<EOS>
His
father
have
be
member
for
Barsetshire
all
his
life
,
and
he
look
forward
to
similar
prosperity
as
though
it
be
part
of
his
inheritance
;
but
he
fail
to
take
any
of
the
step
which
have
secure
his
father
's
seat
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
autumn
of
1834
the
dissolution
come
,
and
Frank
Gresham
,
with
his
honourable
lady
wife
and
all
the
de
Courcys
at
his
back
,
find
that
he
have
mortally
offend
the
county
.
<EOS>
to
his
great
disgust
another
candidate
be
bring
forward
as
a
fellow
to
his
late
colleague
,
and
though
he
manfully
fight
the
battle
,
and
spend
ten
thousand
pound
in
the
contest
,
he
could
not
recover
his
position
.
<EOS>
a
high
Tory
,
with
a
great
Whig
interest
to
back
him
,
be
never
a
popular
person
in
England
.
<EOS>
no
one
can
trust
him
,
though
there
may
be
those
who
be
willing
to
place
him
,
untrusted
,
in
high
position
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
case
with
Mr
Gresham
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
who
be
willing
,
for
family
consideration
,
to
keep
him
in
Parliament
;
but
no
one
think
that
he
be
fit
to
be
there
.
<EOS>
the
consequence
be
,
that
a
bitter
and
expensive
contest
ensue
.
<EOS>
Frank
Gresham
,
when
twit
with
be
a
Whig
,
foreswore
the
de
Courcy
family
;
and
then
,
when
ridicule
as
have
be
throw
over
by
the
Tories
,
foreswore
his
father
's
old
friend
.
<EOS>
so
between
the
two
stool
he
fall
to
the
ground
,
and
,
as
a
politician
,
he
never
again
rise
to
his
foot
.
  
<EOS>
He
never
again
rise
to
his
foot
;
but
twice
again
he
make
violent
effort
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
election
in
East
Barsetshire
,
from
various
cause
,
come
quick
upon
each
other
in
those
day
,
and
before
he
be
eight
-
and
-
twenty
year
of
age
<EOS>
Mr
Gresham
have
three
time
contest
the
county
and
be
three
time
beat
.
<EOS>
to
speak
the
truth
of
him
,
his
own
spirit
would
have
be
satisfied
with
the
loss
of
the
first
ten
thousand
pound
;
but
Lady
Arabella
be
make
of
high
mettle
.
<EOS>
She
have
marry
a
man
with
a
fine
place
and
a
fine
fortune
;
but
she
have
nevertheless
marry
a
commoner
and
have
in
so
far
derogate
from
her
high
birth
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
her
husband
should
be
by
right
a
member
of
the
House
of
Lords
;
but
,
if
not
,
that
it
be
at
least
essential
that
he
should
have
a
seat
in
the
low
chamber
.
<EOS>
She
would
by
degree
sink
into
nothing
if
she
allow
herself
to
sit
down
,
the
mere
wife
of
a
mere
country
squire
.
  
<EOS>
thus
instigate
,
Mr
Gresham
repeat
the
useless
contest
three
time
,
and
repeat
it
each
time
at
a
serious
cost
.
<EOS>
He
lose
his
money
,
Lady
Arabella
lose
her
temper
,
and
thing
at
Greshamsbury
go
on
by
no
mean
as
prosperously
as
they
have
do
in
the
day
of
the
old
squire
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
twelve
year
of
their
marriage
,
child
come
fast
into
the
nursery
at
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
the
first
that
be
bear
be
a
boy
;
and
in
those
happy
halcyon
day
,
when
the
old
squire
be
still
alive
,
great
be
the
joy
at
the
birth
of
an
heir
to
Greshamsbury
;
bonfire
gleam
through
the
country
-
side
,
oxen
be
roast
whole
,
and
the
customary
paraphernalia
of
joy
,
usual
to
rich
briton
on
such
occasion
be
go
through
with
wondrous
éclat
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
tenth
baby
,
and
the
ninth
little
girl
,
be
bring
into
the
world
,
the
outward
show
of
joy
be
not
so
great
.
  
<EOS>
then
other
trouble
come
on
.
<EOS>
some
of
these
little
girl
be
sickly
,
some
very
sickly
.
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
have
her
fault
,
and
they
be
such
as
be
extremely
detrimental
to
her
husband
's
happiness
and
her
own
;
but
that
of
be
an
indifferent
mother
be
not
among
them
.
<EOS>
She
have
worry
her
husband
daily
for
year
because
he
be
not
in
Parliament
,
she
have
worry
him
because
he
would
not
furnish
the
house
in
Portman
Square
,
she
have
worry
him
because
he
object
to
have
more
people
every
winter
at
Greshamsbury
Park
than
the
house
would
hold
;
but
now
she
change
her
tune
and
worry
him
because
Selina
cough
,
because
Helena
be
hectic
,
because
poor
Sophy
's
spine
be
weak
,
and
Matilda
's
appetite
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
worry
from
such
cause
be
pardonable
it
will
be
say
.
<EOS>
so
it
be
;
but
the
manner
be
hardly
pardonable
.
<EOS>
Selina
's
cough
be
certainly
not
fairly
attributable
to
the
old
-
fashioned
furniture
in
Portman
Square
;
nor
would
Sophy
's
spine
have
be
materially
benefit
by
her
father
have
a
seat
in
Parliament
;
and
yet
,
to
have
hear
Lady
Arabella
discuss
those
matter
in
family
conclave
,
one
would
have
think
that
she
would
have
expect
such
result
.
  
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
her
poor
weak
darling
be
carry
about
from
London
to
Brighton
,
from
Brighton

I

He

he
excel
all

<EOS>
the
Greshams
from

have
be
handsome

<EOS>
They
be
broad

blue

fair

bear
with

and
that
pleasant

aristocratic
dangerous
curl

can
equally
express

<EOS>
young

be
every

a
Gresham

and
be
the
darling
of
his

's
heart

<EOS>
the
de
Courcys
have
never
be
plain
.
<EOS>
there
be
too
much
hauteur
,
too
much
pride
,
we
may
perhaps
even
fairly
say
,
too
much
nobility
in
their
gait
and
manner
,
and
even
in
their
face
,
to
allow
of
their
be
consider
plain
;
but
they
be
not
a
race
nurture
by
Venus
or
Apollo

<EOS>
They
be
tall
and
thin
,
with
high
cheek
-
bone
,
high
forehead
,
and
large
,
dignified
,
cold
eye

<EOS>
the
de
Courcy
girl
have
all
good
hair
;
and
,
as
they
also
possess
easy
manner
and
power
of
talk
,
they
manage
to
pass
in
the
world
for
beauty
till
they
be
absorb
in
the
matrimonial
market
,
and
the
world
at
large
care
no

whether
they
be
beauty

<EOS>
the
Misses
Gresham
be
make
in
the

be
not

the

<EOS>
the

Augusta

likely

<EOS>
the

fade

die
one
after
another
 
all
in
the
same
sad
year
 
and
be
lay
in
the
neat

new
cemetery
at
Torquay

<EOS>
then
come
a
pair
,
bear
at
one
birth
,
weak

delicate

frail
little
flower

with
dark

dark

long

pale

with
long

bony

whom
man
look
on
as
fate
to
follow
their

with
quick

<EOS>
Hitherto
,
however
,
they
have
not
follow
them
,
nor
have
they
suffer
as
their
sister
have
suffer
;
and
some
people
at
Greshamsbury
attribute
this
to
the
fact
that
a
change
have
be
make
in
the
family
medical
practitioner
.
  
<EOS>
then
come
the
young
of
the
flock
,
she
whose
birth
we
have
say
be
not

with
loud
joy
;
for
when
she
come

four

with
pale

wan

worn
cheek
,
and
skeleton
,
white

<EOS>
such
be
the
family
when
,
in
the
year
1854
,
the
eld
son
come
of
age
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
educate
at
Harrow
,
and
be
now
still
at
Cambridge
;
but
,
of
course
,
on
such
a
day
as
this
he
be
at
home
.
<EOS>
that
come
of
age
must
be
a
delightful
time
to
a
young
man
bear
to
inherit
broad
acre
and
wide
wealth
.
<EOS>
those
full
-
mouthed
congratulation
;
those
warm
prayer
with
which
his
manhood
be
welcome
by
the
grey
-
haired
senior
of
the
county
;
the
affectionate
,
all
but
motherly
caress
of
neighbouring
mother
who
have
see
him
grow
up
from
his
cradle
,
of
mother
who
have
daughter
,
perhaps
,
fair
enough
,
and
good
enough
,
and
sweet
enough
even
for
him
;
the
soft
-
spoken
,
half
-
bashful
,
but
tender
greeting
of
the
girl
,
who
now
,
perhaps
for
the
first
time
,
call
him
by
his
stern
family
name
,
instruct
by
instinct
rather
than
precept
that
the
time
have
come
when
the
familiar
Charles
or
familiar
John
must
by
them
be
lay
aside
;
the
"
lucky
dog

"
and
hint
of
silver
spoon
which
be
pour
into
his
ear
as
each
young
compeer
slap
his
back
and
bid
him
live
a
thousand
year
<EOS>
and
then
never
die
;
the
shouting
of
the
tenantry
,
the
good
wish
of
the
old
farmer
who
come
up
to
wring
his
hand
,
the
kiss
which
he
get
from
the
farmer
'
wife
,
and
the
kiss
which
he
give
to
the
farmer
<EOS>
"
daughter
;
all
these
thing
must
make
the
twenty
-
first
birthday
pleasant
enough
to
a
young
heir
.
<EOS>
to
a
youth
,
however
,
who
feel
that
he
be
now
liable
to
arrest
,
and
that
he
inherit
no
other
privilege
,
the
pleasure
may
very
possibly
not
be
quite
so
keen
.
  
<EOS>
the
case
with
young
Frank
Gresham
may
be
suppose
to
much
nearer
the
former
than
the
latter
;
but
yet
the
ceremony
of
his
coming
of
age
be
by
no
means
like
that
which
fate
have
accord
to
his
father
.
<EOS>
Mr
Gresham
be
now
an
embarrassed
man
,
and
though
the
world
do
not
know
it
,
or
,
at
any
rate
,
do
not
know
that
he
be
deeply
embarrassed
,
he
have
not
the
heart
to
throw
open
his
mansion
and
receive
the
county
with
a
free
hand
as
though
all
thing
be
go
well
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
be
go
well
with
him
.
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
would
allow
nothing
near
him
or
around
him
to
be
well
.
<EOS>
everything
with
him
now
turn
to
vexation
;
he
be
no
longer
a
joyous
,
happy
man
,
and
the
people
of
East
Barsetshire
do
not
look
for
gala
doing
on
a
grand
scale
when
young
Gresham
come
of
age
.
  
<EOS>
gala
doing
,
to
a
certain
extent
<EOS>
,
there
be
there
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
July
,
and
table
be
spread
under
the
oak
for
the
tenant
.
<EOS>
table
be
spread
,
and
meat
,
and
beer
,
and
wine
be
there
,
and
Frank
,
as
he
walk
round
and
shake
his
guest
by
the
hand
,
express
a
hope
that
their
relation
with
each
other
may
be
long
,
close
,
and
mutually
advantageous
.
  
<EOS>
We
must
say
a
few
word
now
about
the
place
itself
.
<EOS>
Greshamsbury
Park
be
a
fine
old
english
gentleman
's
seat
 
be
and
be
;
but
we
can
assert
it
more
easily
in
past
tense
,
as
we
be
speak
of
it
with
reference
to
a
past
time
.
<EOS>
We
have
speak
of
Greshamsbury
Park
;
there
be
a
park
so
call
,
but
the
mansion
itself
be
generally
know
as
Greshamsbury
House
,
and
do
not
stand
in
the
park
.
<EOS>
We
may
perhaps
best
describe
it
by
say
that
the
village
of
Greshamsbury
consist
of
one
long
,
straggle
street
,
a
mile
in
length
,
which
in
the
centre
turn
sharp
round
,
so
that
one
half
of
the
street
lie
directly
at
right
angle
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
in
this
angle
stand
Greshamsbury
House
,
and
the
garden
and
ground
around
it
fill
up
the
space
so
make
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
entrance
with
large
gate
at
each
end
of
the
village
,
and
each
gate
be
guard
by
the
effigy
of
two
huge
pagan
with
club
,
such
be
the
crest
borne
by
the
family
;
from
each
entrance
a
broad
road
,
quite
straight
,
run
through
to
a
majestic
avenue
of
limes
,
lead
up
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
this
be
build
in
the
rich
,
perhaps
we
should
rather
say
in
the
pure
,
style
of
Tudor
architecture
;
so
much
so
that
,
though
Greshamsbury
be
less
complete
than
Longleat
,
less
magnificent
than
Hatfield
,
it
may
in
some
sense
be
say
to
be
the
fine
speciman
of
Tudor
architecture
of
which
the
country
can
boast
.
  
<EOS>
It
stand
amid
a
multitude
of
trim
garden
and
stone
-
build
terrace
,
divide
one
from
another
:
<EOS>
these
to
our
eye
be
not
so
attractive
as
that
broad
expanse
of
lawn
by
which
our
country
house
be
generally
surround
;
but
the
garden
of
Greshamsbury
have
be
celebrate
for
two
century
,
and
any
Gresham
who
would
have
alter
them
would
have
be
consider
to
have
destroy
one
of
the
well
-
know
landmark
of
the
family
.
  
<EOS>
Greshamsbury
Park
 
properly
so
call
 
spread
far
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
village
.
<EOS>
opposite
to
the
two
great
gate
lead
up
to
the
mansion
be
two
small
gate
,
the
one
opening
on
to
the
stable
,
kennel
,
and
farm
-
yard
,
and
the
other
to
the
deer
park
.
<EOS>
this
latter
be
the
principal
entrance
to
the
demesne
,
and
a
grand
and
picturesque
entrance
it
be
.
<EOS>
the
avenue
of
limes
which
on
one
side
stretch
up
to
the
house
,
be
on
the
other
extend
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,
and
then
appear
to
be
terminate
only
by
an
abrupt
rise
in
the
ground
.
<EOS>
at
the
entrance
there
be
four
savage
and
four
club
,
two
to
each
portal
,
and
what
with
the
massive
iron
gate
,
surmount
by
a
stone
wall
,
on
which
stand
the
family
arm
support
by
two
other
club
-
bearer
,
the
stone
-
build
lodge
,
the
Doric
,
ivy
-
cover
column
which
surround
the
circle
,
the
four
grim
savage
,
and
the
extent
of
the
space
itself
through
which
the
high
road
run
,
and
which
just
abut
on
the
village
,
the
spot
be
sufficiently
significant
of
old
family
greatness
.
  
<EOS>
those
who
examine
it
more
closely
may
see
that
under
the
arm
be
a
scroll
bear
the
Gresham
motto
,
and
that
the
word
be
repeat
in
small
letter
under
each
of
the
savage
.
"
<EOS>
Gardez
Gresham
,
"
have
be
choose
in
the
day
of
motto
-
choose
probably
by
some
herald
-
at
-
arm
as
an
appropriate
legend
for
signify
the
peculiar
attribute
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
unfortunately
,
man
be
not
of
one
mind
as
to
the
exact
idea
signify
.
<EOS>
some
declare
,
with
much
heraldic
warmth
,
that
it
be
an
address
to
the
savage
,
call
on
them
to
take
care
of
their
patron
;
while
other
,
with
whom
I
myself
be
inclined
to
agree
,
aver
with
equal
certainty
that
it
be
an
advice
to
the
people
at
large
,
especially
to
those
incline
to
rebel
against
the
aristocracy
of
the
county
,
that
they
should
"
beware
the
Gresham
.
"
<EOS>
the
latter
signification
would
betoken
strength
 
so
say
the
holder
of
this
doctrine
;
the
former
weakness
.
<EOS>
now
the
Greshams
be
ever
a
strong
people
,
and
never
addict
to
a
false
humility
.
  
<EOS>
We
will
not
pretend
to
decide
the
question
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
either
construction
be
now
equally
unsuited
to
the
family
fortune
.
<EOS>
such
change
have
take
place
in
England
since
the
Greshams
have
found
themselves
that
no
savage
could
any
longer
in
any
way
protect
them
;
they
must
protect
themselves
like
common
folk
,
or
live
unprotected
.
<EOS>
nor
now
be
it
necessary
that
any
neighbour
should
shake
in
his
shoe
when
the
Gresham
frown
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
to
be
wish
that
the
present
Gresham
himself
could
have
be
as
indifferent
to
the
frown
of
some
of
his
neighbour
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
old
symbol
remain
,
and
may
such
symbol
long
remain
among
us
;
they
be
still
lovely
and
fit
to
be
love
.
<EOS>
They
tell
us
of
the
true
and
manly
feeling
of
other
time
;
and
to
him
who
can
read
aright
,
they
explain
more
fully
,
more
truly
than
any
write
history
can
do
,
how
englishman
have
become
what
they
be

<EOS>
England
be
not
yet
a
commercial
country
in
the
sense
in
which
that
epithet
be
use
for
her
;
and
let
us
still
hope
that
she
will
not
soon
become
so
.
<EOS>
She
may
surely
as
well
be
call
feudal
England
,
or
chivalrous
England
.
<EOS>
if
in
western
civilised
Europe
there
do
exist
a
nation
among
whom
there
be
high
signor
,
and
with
whom
the
owner
of
the
land
be
the
true
aristocracy
,
the
aristocracy
that
be
trust
as
be
good
and
fit
to

that
nation

<EOS>
choose
out
the

in

in
Austria

Sardinia

and
then
select
the
ten
in
England
whose

the
result
will
show
in

the

England

<EOS>
yes

as
Venice

She

merchant

barely

buy

be
very
good

it
can

,
and
conical
-
shaped
,
oak
-
cover
excrescence
,
which
be
see
peep
up
through
and
over
each
other
,
that
the
true
extent
of
the
park
be
much
magnify
to
the
eye
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
possible
for
a
stranger
to
get
into
it
and
to
find
some
difficulty
in
get
out
again
by
any
of
its
know
gate
;
and
such
be
the
beauty
of
the
landscape
,
that
a
lover
of
scenery
would
be
tempt
thus
to
lose
himself
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
say
that
on
one
side
lie
the
kennel
,
and
this
will
give
me
an
opportunity
of
describe
here
one
especial
episode
,
a
long
episode
,
in
the
life
of
the
exist
squire
.
<EOS>
He
have
once
represent
his
county
in
Parliament
,
and
when
he
cease
to
do
so
he
still
feel
an
ambition
to
be
connect
in
some
peculiar
way
with
that
county
's
greatness
;
he
still
desire
that
Gresham
of
Greshamsbury
should
be
something
more
in
East
Barsetshire
than
Jackson
of
the
Grange
,
or
Baker
of
Mill
Hill
,
or
Bateson
of
Annesgrove
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
his
friend
,
and
very
respectable
country
gentleman
;
but
Mr
Gresham
of
Greshamsbury
should
be
more
than
this
:
even
he
have
enough
of
ambition
to
be
aware
of
such
a
longing
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
when
an
opportunity
occur
he
take
to
hunt
the
county
.
  
<EOS>
for
this
employment
he
be
in
every
way
well
suited
 
unless
it
be
in
the
matter
of
finance
.
<EOS>
though
he
have
in
his
very
early
manly
year
give
such
great
offence
by
indifference
to
his
family
politic
,
and
have
in
a
certain
degree
foster
the
ill
-
feeling
by
contest
the
county
in
opposition
to
the
wish
of
his
brother
squire
,
nevertheless
,
he
bear
a
loved
and
popular
name
.
<EOS>
man
regret
that
he
should
not
have
be
what
they
wish
him
to
be
,
that
he
should
not
have
be
such
as
be
the
old
squire
;
but
when
they
find
that
such
be
the
case
,
that
he
could
not
be
great
among
them
as
a
politician
,
they
be
still
willing
that
he
should
be
great
in
any
other
way
if
there
be
county
greatness
for
which
he
be
suit
.
<EOS>
now
he
be
know
as
an
excellent
horseman
,
as
a
thorough
sportsman
,
as
one
knowing
in
dog
,
and
tender
-
hearted
as
a
suck
mother
to
a
litter
of
young
fox
;
he
have
ride
in
the
county
since
he
be
fifteen
,
have
a
fine
voice
for
a
view
-
hallo
<EOS>
,
know
every
hound
by
name
,
and
could
wind
a
horn
with
sufficient
music
for
all
hunting
purpose
;
moreover
,
he
have
come
to
his
property
,
as
be
well
know
through
all
Barsetshire
,
with
a
clear
income
of
fourteen
thousand
a
year
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
when
some
old
wear
-
out
master
of
hound
be
run
to
ground
,
about
a
year
after
Mr
Gresham
's
last
contest
for
the
county
,
it
seem
to
all
party
to
be
a
pleasant
and
rational
arrangement
that
the
hound
should
go
to
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
pleasant
,
indeed
,
to
all
except
the
Lady
Arabella
;
and
rational
,
perhaps
,
to
all
except
the
squire
himself
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
time
he
be
already
considerably
encumber
.
<EOS>
He
have
spend
much
more
than
he
should
have
do
,
and
so
indeed
have
his
wife
,
in
those
two
splendid
year
in
which
they
have
figure
as
great
among
the
great
one
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
fourteen
thousand
a
year
ought
to
have
be
enough
to
allow
a
member
of
Parliament
with
a
young
wife
and
two
or
three
child
to
live
in
London
and
keep
up
their
country
family
mansion
;
but
then
the
de
Courcys
be
very
great
people
,
and
Lady
Arabella
choose
to
live
as
she
have
be
accustom
to
do
,
and
as
her
sister
-
in
-
law
the
countess
live
:
<EOS>
now
Lord
de
Courcy
have
much
more
than
fourteen
thousand
a
year
.
<EOS>
then
come
the
three
election
,
with
their
vast
attendant
cost
,
and
then
those
costly
expedient
to
which
gentleman
be
force
to
have
recourse
who
have
live
beyond
their
income
,
and
find
it
impossible
so
to
reduce
their
establishment
as
to
live
much
below
it
.
<EOS>
thus
when
the
hound
come
to
Greshamsbury
,
Mr
Gresham
be
already
a
poor
man
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
say
much
to
oppose
their
come
;
but
Lady
Arabella
,
though
it
could
hardly
be
say
of
her
that
she
be
under
her
husband
's
rule
,
certainly
be
not
entitle
to
boast
that
she
have
him
under
her
.
<EOS>
She
then
make
her
first
grand
attack
as
to
the
furniture
in
Portman
Square
;
and
be
then
for
the
first
time
specially
inform
that
the
furniture
there
be
not
matter
of
much
importance
,
as
she
would
not
in
future
be
require
to
move
her
family
to
that
residence
during
the
London
season
.
<EOS>
the
sort
of
conversation
which
grow
from
such
a
commencement
may
be
imagine
.
<EOS>
have
Lady
Arabella
worry
her
lord
less
,
he
may
perhaps
have
consider
with
more
coolness
the
folly
of
encounter
so
prodigious
an
increase
to
the
expense
of
his
establishment
;
have
he
not
spend
so
much
money
in
a
pursuit
which
his
wife
do
not
enjoy
,
she
may
perhaps
have
be
more
spare
in
her
rebuke
as
to
his
indifference
to
her
London
pleasure
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
the
hound
come
to
Greshamsbury
,
and
Lady
Arabella
do
go
to
London
for
some
period
in
each
year
,
and
the
family
expense
be
by
no
means
lessen
.
  
<EOS>
the
kennel
,
however
,
be
now
again
empty
.
<EOS>
two
year
previous
to
the
time
at
which
our
story
begin
,
the
hound
have
be
carry
off
to
the
seat
of
some
rich
sportsman
.
<EOS>
this
be
more
feel
by
Mr
Gresham
than
any
other
misfortune
which
he
have
yet
incur
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
master
of
hound
for
ten
year
,
and
that
work
he
have
at
any
rate
do
well
.
<EOS>
the
popularity
among
his
neighbour
which
he
have
lose
as
a
politician
he
have
regain
as
a
sportsman
,
and
he
would
fain
have
remain
autocratic
in
the
hunt
,
have
it
be
possible
.
<EOS>
but
he
so
remain
much
longer
than
he
should
have
do
,
and
at
last
they
go
away
,
not
without
sign
and
sound
of
visible
joy
on
the
part
of
Lady
Arabella
.
  
<EOS>
but
we
have
keep
the
Greshamsbury
tenantry
wait
under
the
oak
-
tree
by
far
too
long
.
<EOS>
yes
;
when
young
Frank
come
of
age
there
be
still
enough
leave
at
Greshamsbury
,
still
mean
enough
at
the
squire
's
disposal
,
to
light
one
bonfire
,
to
roast
,
whole
in
its
skin
,
one
bullock
.
<EOS>
Frank
's
virility
come
on
him
not
quite
unmarked
,
as
that
of
the
parson
's
son
may
do
,
or
the
son
of
the
neighbouring
attorney
.
<EOS>
It
could
still
be
report
in
the
Barsetshire
Conservative
_
Standard
_
that
"
the
beard
wag
all
"
at
Greshamsbury
,
now
as
they
have
do
for
many
century
on
similar
festival
.
<EOS>
yes
;
it
be
so
report
.
<EOS>
but
this
,
like
so
many
other
such
report
,
have
but
a
shadow
of
truth
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
They
pour
the
liquor
in
,
"
certainly
,
those
who
be
there
;
but
the
beard
do
not
wag
as
they
have
be
will
not
to
wag
in
former
year
.
<EOS>
Beards
will
not
wag
for
the
telling
.
<EOS>
the
squire
be
at
his
wit
"
end
for
money
,
and
the
tenant
one
and
all
have
so
hear
.
<EOS>
rent
have
be
raise
on
them
;
timber
have
fall
fast
;
the
lawyer
on
the
estate
be
grow
rich
;
tradesman
in
Barchester
,
nay
,
in
Greshamsbury
itself
,
be
begin
to
mutter
;
and
the
squire
himself
would
not
be
merry
.
<EOS>
under
such
circumstance
the
throat
of
a
tenantry
will
still
swallow
,
but
their
beard
will
not
wag
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mind
well
,
"
say
Farmer
Oaklerath
to
his
neighbour
,
"
when
the
squoire
hisself
come
of
age
.
<EOS>
Lord
love
"
ee
!
<EOS>
there
be
fun
go
that
day
.
<EOS>
there
be
more
yale

than
be

at
the
big
house
these
two

.
<EOS>
t'old

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
mind
when

mind
it
well

"
say
an
old
farmer
sit
opposite
.
<EOS>
"
Them

<EOS>
It
an't
that
long
ago
neither

<EOS>
squoire
a'nt
come

no

nor

look

<EOS>
thing
be
alter
at
Greemsbury
"
 
<EOS>
such
be
the
rural
pronunciation
 
"
alter
sadly
,
neebor
Oaklerath
.
<EOS>
well
,
well
;
I
will
soon
be
go
,
I
will
,
and
so
it
an't
no
use
talk
;
but
arter
pay
one
pound
fifteen
for
them
acre
for
more
nor
fifty
year
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
think
I
would
ever
be
axe
for
forty
shilling
.
"
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
style
of
conversation
which
go
on
at
the
various
table
.
<EOS>
It
have
certainly
be
of
a
very
different
tone
when
the
squire
be
bear
,
when
he
come
of
age
,
and
when
,
just
two
year
subsequently
,
his
son
have
be
bear
.
<EOS>
on
each
of
these
event
similar
rural
fête
have
be
give
,
and
the
squire
himself
have
on
these
occasion
be
frequent
among
his
guest
.
<EOS>
on
the
first
,
he
have
be
carry
round
by
his
father
,
a
whole
train
of
lady
and
nurse
follow
.
<EOS>
on
the
second
,
he
have
himself
mix
in
all
the
sport
,
the
gay
of
the
gay
,
and
each
tenant
have
squeeze
his
way
up
to
the
lawn
to
get
a
sight
of
the
Lady
Arabella
,
who
,
as
be
already
know
,
be
to
come
from
Courcy
Castle
to
Greshamsbury
to
be
their
mistress
.
<EOS>
It
be
little
they
any
of
them
care
now
for
the
Lady
Arabella
.
<EOS>
on
the
third
,
he
himself
have
bear
his
child
in
his
arm
as
his
father
have
before
bear
him
;
he
be
then
in
the
zenith
of
his
pride
,
and
though
the
tenantry
whisper
that
he
be
somewhat
less
familiar
with
them
than
of
yore
,
that
he
have
put
on
somewhat
too
much
of
the
de
Courcy
air
,
still
he
be
their
squire
,
their
master
,
the
rich
man
in
whose
hand
they
lie
.
<EOS>
the
old
squire
be
then
go
,
and
they
be
proud
of
the
young
member
and
his
lady
bride
in
spite
of
a
little
hauteur
.
<EOS>
none
of
them
be
proud
of
him
now
.
  
<EOS>
He
walk
once
round
among
the
guest
,
and
speak
a
few
word
of
welcome
at
each
table
;
and
as
he
do
<EOS>
so
the
tenant
get
up
and
bow
and
wish
health
to
the
old
squire
,
happiness
to
the
young
one
,
and
prosperity
to
Greshamsbury
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
it
be
but
a
tame
affair
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
also
other
visitor
,
of
the
gentle
sort
,
to
do
honour
to
the
occasion
;
but
not
such
swarm
,
not
such
a
crowd
at
the
mansion
itself
and
at
the
house
of
the
neighbour
gentry
as
have
always
be
collect
on
these
former
gala
doing
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
party
at
Greshamsbury
be
not
a
large
one
,
and
consist
chiefly
of
Lady
de
Courcy
and
her
suite
.
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
still
keep
up
,
as
far
as
she
be
able
,
her
close
connexion
with
Courcy
Castle
.
<EOS>
She
be
there
as
much
as
possible
,
to
which
Mr
Gresham
never
object
;
and
she
take
her
daughter
there
whenever
she
could
,
though
,
as
regard
the
two
eld
girl
,
she
be
interfere
with
by
Mr
Gresham
,
and
not
unfrequently
by
the
girl
themselves
.
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
have
a
pride
in
her
son
,
though
he
be
by
no
mean
her
favourite
child
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
however
,
the
heir
of
Greshamsbury
,
of
which
fact
she
be
dispose
to
make
the
most
,
and
he
be
also
a
fine
gainly
open
-
hearted
young
man
,
who
could
not
but
be
dear
to
any
mother
.
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
do
love
him
dearly
,
though
she
feel
a
sort
of
disappointment
in
regard
to
him
,
see
that
he
be
not
so
much
like
a
de
Courcy
as
he
should
have
be
.
<EOS>
She
do
love
him
dearly
;
and
,
therefore
,
when
he
come
of
age
she
get
her
sister
-
in
-
law
and
all
the
Ladies
Amelia
,
<EOS>
Rosina
etc
.
,
to
come
to
Greshamsbury
;
and
she
also
,
with
some
difficulty
,
persuade
the
honourable
Georges
and
the
honourable
Johns
to
be
equally
condescend
.
<EOS>
Lord
de
Courcy
himself
be
in
attendance
at
the
Court
 
or
say
that
he
be
 
and
Lord
Porlock
,
the
eld
son
,
simply
tell
his
aunt
when
he
be
invite
that
he
never
bore
himself
with
those
sort
of
thing
.
  
<EOS>
then
there
be
the
Bakers
,
and
the
bateson
,
and
the
Jacksons
,
who
all
live
near
and
return
home
at
night
;
there
be
the
Reverend
Caleb
Oriel
,
the
high
-
church
rector
,
with
his
beautiful
sister
,
Patience
Oriel
;
there
be
Mr
Yates
Umbleby
,
the
attorney
and
agent
;
and
there
be
Dr
Thorne
,
and
the
doctor
's
modest
,
quiet
-
look
little
niece
,
Miss
Mary
.
   
<EOS>
long
,
long
ago
 
as
Dr
Thorne
be
our
hero
 
or
I
should
rather
say
my
hero
,
a
privilege
of
select
for
themselves
in
this
respect
be
leave
to
all
my
reader
 
and
as
Miss
Mary
Thorne
be
to
be
our
heroine
,
a
point
on
which
no
choice
whatsoever
be
leave
to
any
one
,
it
be
necessary
that
they
shall
be
introduce
and
explain
and
describe
in
a
proper
,
formal
manner
.
<EOS>
I
quite
feel
that
an
apology
be
due
for
begin
a
novel
with
two
long
dull
chapter
full
of
description
.
<EOS>
I
be
perfectly
aware
of
the
danger
of
such
a
course
.
<EOS>
in
so
do
I
sin
against
the
golden
rule
which
require
us
all
to
put
our
good
foot
foremost
,
the
wisdom
of
which
be
fully
recognise
by
novelist
,
myself
among
the
number
.
<EOS>
It
can
hardly
be
expect
that
any
one
will
consent
to
go
through
with
a
fiction
that
offer
so
little
of
allurement
in
its
first
page
;
but
twist
it
<EOS>
as
I
will
I
can
not
do
otherwise
.
<EOS>
I
find
that
I
can
not
make
poor
Mr
Gresham
hem
and
haw
and
turn
himself
uneasily
in
his
arm
-
chair
in
a
natural
manner
till
I
have
say
why
he
be
uneasy
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
bring
in
my
doctor
speak
his
mind
freely
among
the
bigwig
till
I
have
explain
that
it
be
in
accordance
with
his
usual
character
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
this
be
unartistic
on
my
part
,
and
show
want
of
imagination
as
well
as
want
of
skill
.
<EOS>
whether
or
not
I
can
atone
for
these
fault
by
straightforward
,
simple
,
plain
story
-
tell
 
that
,
indeed
,
be
very
doubtful
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
belong
to
a
family
in
one
sense
as
good
,
and
at
any
rate
as
old
,
as
that
of
Mr
Gresham
;
and
much
old
,
he
be
apt
to
boast
,
than
that
of
the
de
Courcys
.
<EOS>
this
trait
in
his
character
be
mention
first
,
as
it
be
the
weakness
for
which
he
be
most
conspicuous
.
<EOS>
He
be
second
cousin
to
Mr
Thorne
of
Ullathorne
,
a
Barsetshire
squire
live
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Barchester
,
and
who
boast
that
his
estate
have
remain
in
his
family
,
descend
from
Thorne
to
Thorne
,
longer
than
have
be
the
case
with
any
other
estate
or
any
other
family
in
the
county
.
  
<EOS>
but
Dr
Thorne
be
only
a
second
cousin
;
and
,
therefore
,
though
he
be
entitle
to
talk
of
the
blood
as
belong
to
some
extent
to
himself
,
he
have
no
right
to
lay
claim
to
any
position
in
the
county
other
than
such
as
he
may
win
for
himself
if
he
choose
to
locate
himself
in
it
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
fact
of
which
no
one
be
more
fully
aware
than
our
doctor
himself
.
<EOS>
His
father
,
who
have
be
first
cousin
of
a
former
Squire
Thorne
,
have
be
a
clerical
dignitary
in
Barchester
,
but
have
be
dead
now
many
year
.
<EOS>
He
have
have
two
son
;
one
he
have
educate
as
a
medical
man
,
but
the
other
,
and
the
young
,
whom
he
have
intend
for
the
Bar
,
have
not
betake
himself
in
any
satisfactory
way
to
any
calling
.
<EOS>
this
son
have
be
first
rusticate
from
Oxford
,
and
then
expel
;
and
thence
return
to
Barchester
,
have
be
the
cause
to
his
father
and
brother
of
much
suffering
.
  
<EOS>
Old
Dr
Thorne
,
the
clergyman
,
die
when
the
two
brother
be
yet
young
man
,
and
leave
behind
him
nothing
but
some
household
and
other
property
of
the
value
of
about
two
thousand
pound
,
which
he
bequeath
to
Thomas
,
the
eld
son
,
much
more
than
that
have
be
spend
in
liquidating
debt
contract
by
the
young
.
<EOS>
up
to
that
time
there
have
be
close
harmony
between
the
Ullathorne
family
and
that
of
the
clergyman
;
but
a
month
or
two
before
the
doctor
's
death
 
<EOS>
the
period
of
which
we
be
speak
be
about
two
-
and
-
twenty
year
before
the
commencement
of
our
story
 
the
then
Mr
Thorne
of
Ullathorne
have
make
it
understand
that
he
would
no
longer
receive
at
his
house
his
cousin
Henry
,
whom
he
regard
as
a
disgrace
to
the
family
.
  
<EOS>
father
be
apt
to
be
more
lenient
to
their
son
than
uncle
to
their
nephew
,
or
cousin
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
still
hope
to
reclaim
his
black
sheep
,
and
think
that
the
head
of
his
family
show
an
unnecessary
harshness
in
put
an
obstacle
in
his
way
of
do
so
.
<EOS>
and
if
the
father
be
warm
in
support
of
his
profligate
son
,
the
young
medical
aspirant
be
warm
in
support
of
his
profligate
brother
.
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
,
junior
,
be
no
roué
himself
,
but
perhaps
,
as
a
young
man
,
he
have
not
sufficient
abhorrence
of
his
brother
's
vice
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
he
stick
to
him
manfully
;
and
when
it
be
signify
in
the
close
that
Henry
's
company
be
not
consider
desirable
at
Ullathorne
,
Dr
Thomas
Thorne
send
word
to
the
squire
that
under
such
circumstance
his
visit
there
would
also
cease
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
not
very
prudent
,
as
the
young
Galen
have
elect
to
establish
himself
in
Barchester
,
very
mainly
in
expectation
of
the
help
which
his
ullathorne
connexion
would
give
him
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
in
his
anger
he
fail
to
consider
;
he
be
never
know
,
either
in
early
or
in
middle
life
,
to
consider
in
his
anger
those
point
which
be
probably
best
worth
his
consideration
.
<EOS>
this
,
perhaps
,
be
of
the
less
moment
as
his
anger
be
of
an
unenduring
kind
,
evaporate
frequently
with
more
celerity
than
he
could
get
the
angry
word
out
of
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
with
the
ullathorne
people
,
however
,
he
do
establish
a
quarrel
sufficiently
permanent
to
be
of
vital
injury
to
his
medical
prospect
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
the
father
die
,
and
the
two
brother
be
leave
live
together
with
very
little
mean
between
them
.
<EOS>
at
this
time
there
be
live
,
in
Barchester
,
people
of
the
name
of
Scatcherd
.
<EOS>
of
that
family
,
as
then
exist
,
we
have
only
to
do
with
two
,
a
brother
and
a
sister
.
<EOS>
They
be
in
a
low
rank
of
life
,
the
one
be
a
journeyman
stone
-
mason
,
and
the
other
an
apprentice
to
a
straw
-
bonnet
maker
;
but
they
be
,
nevertheless
,
in
some
sort
remarkable
people
.
<EOS>
the
sister
be
repute
in
Barchester
to
be
a
model
of
female
beauty
of
the
strong
and
robuster
cast
,
and
have
also
a
well
reputation
as
be
a
girl
of
good
character
and
honest
,
womanly
conduct
.
<EOS>
both
of
her
beauty
and
of
her
reputation
her
brother
be
exceedingly
proud
,
and
he
be
the
more
so
when
he
learn
that
she
have
be
ask
in
marriage
by
a
decent
master
-
tradesman
in
the
city
.
  
<EOS>
Roger
Scatcherd
have
also
a
reputation
,
but
not
for
beauty
or
propriety
of
conduct
.
<EOS>
He
be
know
for
the
good
stone
-
mason
in
the
four
county
,
and
as
the
man
who
could
,
on
occasion
,
drink
the
most
alcohol
in
a
give
time
in
the
same
locality
.
<EOS>
as
a
workman
,
indeed
,
he
have
high
reputate
even
than
this
:
he
be
not
only
a
good
and
very
quick
stone
-
mason
,
but
he
have
also
a
capacity
for
turn
other
man
into
good
stone
-
mason
:
he
have
a
gift
of
know
what
a
man
could
and
should
do
;
and
,
by
degree
,
he
teach
himself
what
five
,
and
ten
,
and
twenty
 
<EOS>
latterly
,
what
a
thousand
and
two
thousand
man
may
accomplish
among
them
:
this
,
also
,
he
do
with
very
little
aid
from
pen
and
paper
,
with
which
he
be
not
,
and
never
become
,
very
conversant
.
<EOS>
He
have
also
other
gift
and
other
propensity
.
<EOS>
He
could
talk
in
a
manner
dangerous
to
himself
and
other
;
he
could
persuade
without
know
that
he
do
so
;
and
be
himself
an
extreme
demagogue
,
in
those
noisy
time
just
prior
to
the
Reform
Bill
,
he
create
a
hubbub
in
Barchester
of
which
he
himself
have
have
no
previous
conception
.
  
<EOS>
Henry
Thorne
among
his
other
bad
quality
have
one
which
his
friend
regard
as
bad
than
all
the
other
,
and
which
perhaps
justify
the
ullathorne
people
in
their
severity
.
<EOS>
He
love
to
consort
with
low
people
.
<EOS>
He
not
only
drink
 
that
may
have
be
forgive
 
<EOS>
but
he
drink
in
tap
-
room
with
vulgar
drinker
;
so
say
his
friend
,
and
so
say
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
He
deny
the
charge
as
be
make
in
the
plural
number
,
and
declare
that
his
only
low
co
-
reveller
be
Roger
Scatcherd
.
<EOS>
with
Roger
Scatcherd
,
at
any
rate
,
he
associate
,
and
become
as
democratic
as
Roger
be
himself
.
<EOS>
now
the
Thornes
of
Ullathorne
be
of
the
very
high
order
of
Tory
excellence
.
  
<EOS>
whether
or
not
Mary
Scatcherd
at
once
accept
the
offer
of
the
respectable
tradesman
,
I
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
after
the
occurrence
of
certain
event
which
must
here
shortly
be
tell
,
she
declare
that
she
never
have
do
so
.
<EOS>
Her
brother
aver
that
she
most
positively
have
.
<EOS>
the
respectable
tradesman
himself
refuse
to
speak
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
certain
,
however
,
that
Scatcherd
,
who
have
hitherto
be
silent
enough
about
his
sister
in
those
social
hour
which
he
pass
with
his
gentleman
friend
,
boast
of
the
engagement
when
it
be
,
as
he
say
,
make
;
and
then
boast
also
of
the
girl
's
beauty
.
<EOS>
Scatcherd
,
in
spite
of
his
occasional
intemperance
,
look
up
in
the
world
,
and
the
come
marriage
of
his
sister
be
,
he
think
,
suitable
to
his
own
ambition
for
his
family
.
  
<EOS>
Henry
Thorne
have
already
hear
of
,
and
already
see
,
Mary
Scatcherd
;
but
hitherto
she
have
not
fall
in
the
way
of
his
wickedness
.
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
when
he
hear
that
she
be
to
be
decently
married
,
the
devil
tempt
him
to
tempt
her
.
<EOS>
It
boot
not
to
tell
all
the
tale
.
<EOS>
It
come
out
clearly
enough
when
all
be
tell
,
that
he
make
her
most
distinct
promise
of
marriage
;
he
even
give
her
such
in
writing
;
and
have
in
this
way
obtain
from
her
her
company
during
some
of
her
little
holiday
 
<EOS>
her
sunday
or
summer
evening
 
<EOS>
he
seduce
her
.
<EOS>
Scatcherd
accuse
him
openly
of
have
intoxicate
her
with
drug
;
and
Thomas
Thorne
,
who
take
up
the
case
,
ultimately
believe
the
charge
.
<EOS>
It
become
know
in
Barchester
that
she
be
with
child
,
and
that
the
seducer
be
Henry
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
Roger
Scatcherd
,
when
the
news
first
reach
him
,
fill
himself
with
drink
,
and
then
swear
that
he
would
kill
them
both
.
<EOS>
with
manly
wrath
,
however
,
he
set
forth
,
first
against
the
man
,
and
that
with
manly
weapon
.
<EOS>
He
take
nothing
with
him
but
his
fist
and
a
big
stick
as
he
go
in
search
of
Henry
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
brother
be
then
lodge
together
at
a
farm
-
house
close
abut
on
the
town
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
an
eligible
abode
for
a
medical
practitioner
;
but
the
young
doctor
have
not
be
able
to
settle
himself
eligibly
since
his
father
's
death
;
and
wish
to
put
what
constraint
he
could
upon
his
brother
,
have
so
locate
himself
.
<EOS>
to
this
farm
-
house
come
Roger
Scatcherd
one
sultry
summer
evening
,
his
anger
gleam
from
his
bloodshot
eye
,
and
his
rage
heighten
to
madness
by
the
rapid
pace
at
which
he
have
run
from
the
city
,
and
by
the
ardent
spirit
which
be
ferment
within
him
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
very
gate
of
the
farm
-
yard
,
stand
placidly
with
his
cigar
in
his
mouth
,
he
encounter
Henry
Thorne
.
<EOS>
He
have
think
of
search
for
him
through
the
whole
premise
,
of
demand
his
victim
with
loud
exclamation
,
and
make
his
way
to
him
through
all
obstacle
.
<EOS>
in
lieu
of
that
,
there
stand
the
man
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Roger
,
what
be
in
the
wind
?
"
say
Henry
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
the
last
word
he
ever
speak
.
<EOS>
He
be
answer
by
a
blow
from
the
blackthorn
.
<EOS>
a
contest
ensue
,
which
end
in
Scatcherd
keep
his
word
 
at
any
rate
,
as
regard
the
bad
offender
.
<EOS>
how
the
fatal
blow
on
the
temple
be
strike
be
never
exactly
determine
:
one
medical
man
say
it
may
have
be
do
in
a
fight
with
a
heavy
-
headed
stick
;
another
think
that
a
stone
have
be
use
;
a
third
suggest
a
stone
-
mason
's
hammer
.
<EOS>
It
seem
,
however
,
to
be
prove
subsequently
that
no
hammer
be
take
out
,
and
Scatcherd
himself
persist
in
declare
that
he
have
take
in
his
hand
no
weapon
but
the
stick
.
<EOS>
Scatcherd
,
however
,
be
drunk
;
and
even
though
he
intend
to
tell
the
truth
,
may
have
be
mistake
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
however
,
the
fact
that
Thorne
be
dead
;
that
Scatcherd
have
swear
to
kill
him
about
an
hour
previously
;
and
that
he
have
without
delay
accomplish
his
threat
.
<EOS>
He
be
arrest
and
try
for
murder
;
all
the
distress
circumstance
of
the
case
come
out
on
the
trial
:
he
be
find
guilty
of
manslaughter
,
and
sentence
to
be
imprison
for
six
month
.
<EOS>
Our
reader
will
probably
think
that
the
punishment
be
too
severe
.
  
<EOS>
Thomas
Thorne
and
the
farmer
be
on
the
spot
soon
after
Henry
Thorne
have
fall
.
<EOS>
the
brother
be
at
first
furious
for
vengeance
against
his
brother
's
murderer
;
but
,
as
the
fact
come
out
,
as
he
learn
what
have
be
the
provocation
give
,
what
have
be
the
feeling
of
Scatcherd
when
he
leave
the
city
,
determine
to
punish
him
who
have
ruin
his
sister
,
his
heart
be
change
.
<EOS>
those
be
try
day
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
behove
him
to
do
what
in
him
lie
to
cover
his
brother
's
memory
from
the
obloquy
which
it
deserve
;
it
behove
him
also
to
save
,
or
to
assist
to
save
,
from
undue
punishment
the
unfortunate
man
who
have
shed
his
brother
's
blood
;
and
it
behove
him
also
,
at
least
so
he
think
,
to
look
after
that
poor
fall
one
whose
misfortune
be
less
merited
than
those
either
of
his
brother
or
of
hers
.
  
<EOS>
and
he
be
not
the
man
to
get
through
these
thing
lightly
,
or
with
as
much
ease
as
he
perhaps
may
conscientiously
have
do
.
<EOS>
He
would
pay
for
the
defence
of
the
prisoner
;
he
would
pay
for
the
defence
of
his
brother
's
memory
;
and
he
would
pay
for
the
poor
girl
's
comfort
.
<EOS>
He
would
do
this
,
and
he
would
allow
no
one
to
help
him
.
<EOS>
He
stand
alone
in
the
world
,
and
insist
on
so
stand
.
<EOS>
Old
Mr
Thorne
of
Ullathorne
offer
again
to
open
his
arm
to
him
;
but
he
have
conceive
a
foolish
idea
that
his
cousin
's
severity
have
drive
his
brother
on
to
his
bad
career
,
and
he
would
consequently
accept
no
kindness
from
Ullathorne
.
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
,
the
old
squire
's
daughter
 
a

considerably
old

send

a
blank
cover
.
<EOS>
He
have
still
enough
for
those
unhappy
purpose
which
he
have
in
hand
.
<EOS>
as
to
what
may
happen
afterwards
,
he
be
then
mainly
indifferent
.
  
<EOS>
the
affair
make
much
noise
in
the
county
,
and
be
inquire
into
closely
by
many
of
the
county
magistrate
;
by
none
more
closely
than
by
John
Newbold
Gresham
,
who
be
then
alive
.
<EOS>
Mr
Gresham
be
greatly
take
with
the
energy
and
justice
show
by
Dr
Thorne
on
the
occasion
;
and
when
the
trial
be
over
,
he
invite
him
to
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
the
visit
end
in
the
doctor
establish
himself
in
that
village
.
  
<EOS>
We
must
return
for
a
moment
to
Mary
Scatcherd
.
<EOS>
She
be
save
from
the
necessity
of
encounter
her
brother
's
wrath
,
for
that
brother
be
under
arrest
for
murder
before
he
could
get
at
her
.
<EOS>
Her
immediate
lot
,
however
,
be
a
cruel
one
.
<EOS>
deep
as
be
her
cause
for
anger
against
the
man
who
have
so
inhumanly
use
her
<EOS>
,
still
it
be
natural
that
she
should
turn
to
him
with
love
rather
than
with
aversion
.
<EOS>
to
whom
else
could
she
in
such
plight
look
for
love
?
<EOS>
when
,
therefore
,
she
hear
that
he
be
slay
,
her
heart
sink
within
her
;
she
turn
her
face
to
the
wall
,
and
lay
herself
down
to
die
:
to
die
a
double
death
,
for
herself
and
the
fatherless
babe
that
be
now
quick
within
her
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
in
fact
,
life
have
still
much
to
offer
,
both
to
her
and
to
her
child
.
<EOS>
for
her
it
be
still
destine
that
she
should
,
in
a
distant
land
,
be
the
worthy
wife
of
a
good
husband
,
and
the
happy
mother
of
many
child
.
<EOS>
for
that
embryo
one
it
be
destine
 
but
that
may
not
be
so
quickly
tell
:
to
describe
her
destiny
this
volume
have
yet
to
be
write
.
  
<EOS>
even
in
those
bitter
day
God
temper
the
wind
to
the
shorn
lamb
.
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
be
by
her
bedside
soon
after
the
bloody
tiding
have
reach
her
,
and
do
for
her
more
than
either
her
lover
or
her
brother
could
have
do
.
<EOS>
when
the
baby
be
bear
,
Scatcherd
be
still
in
prison
,
and
have
still
three
month
"
more
confinement
to
undergo
.
<EOS>
the
story
of
her
great
wrong
and
cruel
usage
be
much
talk
of
,
and
man
say
that
one
who
have
be
so
injure
should
be
regard
as
have
in
nowise
sin
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
one
man
,
at
any
rate
,
so
think
.
<EOS>
at
twilight
,
one
evening
,
Thorne
be
surprise
by
a
visit
from
a
demure
Barchester
hardware
dealer
,
whom
he
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
address
before
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
former
lover
of
poor
Mary
Scatcherd
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
proposal
to
make
,
and
it
be
this
:
 
<EOS>
if
Mary
would
consent
to
leave
the
country
at
once
,
to
leave
it
without
notice
from
her
brother
,
or
talk
or
éclat
on
the
matter
,
he
would
sell
all
that
he
have
,
marry
her
,
and
emigrate
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
one
condition
;
she
must
leave
her
baby
behind
her
.
<EOS>
the
hardware
-
man
could
find
it
in
his
heart
to
be
generous
,
to
be
generous
and
true
to
his
love
;
but
he
could
not
be
generous
enough
to
father
the
seducer
's
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
never
abide
it
,
sir
,
if
I
take
it
,
"
say
he
;
"
and
she
,
 
why
in
course
she
would
always
love
it
the
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
praise
his
generosity
,
who
can
mingle
any
censure
for
such
manif
prudence
?
<EOS>
He
would
still
make
her
the
wife
of
his
bosom
,
defile
in
the
eye
of
the
world
as
she
have
be
;
but
she
must
be
to
him
the
mother
of
his
own
child
,
not
the
mother
of
another
's
child
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
again
our
doctor
have
a
hard
task
to
win
through
.
<EOS>
He
see
at
once
that
it
be
his
duty
to
use
his
utmost
authority
to
induce
the
poor
girl
to
accept
such
an
offer
.
<EOS>
She
like
the
man
;
and
here
be
open
to
her
a
course
which
would
have
be
most
desirable
,
even
before
her
misfortune
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
hard
to
persuade
a
mother
to
part
with
her
first
babe
;
harder
,
perhaps
,
when
the
babe
have
be
so
father
and
so
bear
than
when
the
world
have
shine
brightly
on
its
early
hour
.
<EOS>
She
at
first
refuse
stoutly
:
she
send
a
thousand
love
,
a
thousand
thank
,
profusest
acknowledgement
for
his
generosity
to
the
man
who
show
her
that
he
love
her
so
well
;
but
Nature
,
she
say
,
would
not
let
her
leave
her
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
will
you
do
for
her
here
,
Mary
?
"
say
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
poor
Mary
reply
to
him
with
a
deluge
of
tear
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
my
niece
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
take
up
the
tiny
infant
in
his
huge
hand
;
"
she
be
already
the
near
thing
,
the
only
thing
that
I
have
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
I
be
her
uncle
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
go
with
this
man
I
will
be
father
to
her
and
mother
to
her
.
<EOS>
of
what
bread
I
eat
,
she
shall
eat
;
of
what
cup
I
drink
,
she
shall
drink
.
<EOS>
see
,
Mary
,
here
be
the
Bible
;
"
and
he
cover
the
book
with
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
leave
her
to
me
,
and
by
this
word
she
shall
be
my
child
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
mother
consent
at
last
;
leave
her
baby
with
the
doctor
,
marry
,
and
go
to
America
.
<EOS>
all
this
be
consummate
before
Roger
Scatcherd
be
liberate
from
jail
.
<EOS>
some
condition
the
doctor
make
.
<EOS>
the
first
be
,
that
Scatcherd
should
not
know
his
sister
's
child
be
thus
dispose
of
.
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
,
in
undertaking
to
bring
up
the
baby
,
do
not
choose
to
encounter
any
tie
with
person
who
may
hereafter
claim
to
be
the
girl
's
relation
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
relation
<EOS>
she
would
undoubtedly
have
have
none
have
she
be
leave
to
live
or
die
as
a
workhouse
bastard
;
but
should
the
doctor
succeed
in
life
,
should
he
ultimately
be
able
to
make
this
girl
the
darling
of
his
own
house
,
and
then
the
darling
of
some
other
house
,
should
she
live
and
win
the
heart
of
some
man
whom
the
doctor
may
delight
to
call
his
friend
and
nephew
;
then
relation
may
spring
up
whose
tie
would
not
be
advantageous
.
  
<EOS>
no
man
plume
himself
on
good
blood
more
than
Dr
Thorne
;
no
man
have
great
pride
in
his
genealogical
tree
,
and
his
hundred
and
thirty
clearly
prove
descent
from
MacAdam
;
no
man
have
a
strong
theory
as
to
the
advantage
hold
by
man
who
have
grandfather
over
those
who
have
none
,
or
have
none
worth
talk
about
.
<EOS>
let
it
not
be
think
that
our
doctor
be
a
perfect
character
.
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
;
most
far
from
perfect
.
<EOS>
He
have
within
him
an
inner
,
stubborn
,
self
-
admire
pride
,
which
make
him
believe
himself
to
be
well
and
high
than
those
around
him
,
and
this
from
some
unknown
cause
which
he
could
hardly
explain
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
pride
in
be
a
poor
man
of
a
high
family
;
he
have
a
pride
in
repudiate
the
very
family
of
which
he
be
proud
;
and
he
have
a
special
pride
in
keep
his
pride
silently
to
himself
.
<EOS>
His
father
have
be
a
Thorne
,
and
his
mother
a
Thorold
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
well
blood
to
be
have
in
England
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
possession
of
such
property
as
these
that
he
condescend
to
rejoice
;
this
man
,
with
a
man
's
heart
,
a
man
's
courage
,
and
a
man
's
humanity
!
<EOS>
other
doctor
round
the
county
have
ditch
-
water
in
their
vein
;
he
could
boast
of
a
pure
ichor
,
to
which
that
of
the
great
Omnium
family
be
but
a
muddy
puddle
.
<EOS>
It
be
thus
that
he
love
to
excel
his
brother
practitioner
,
he
who
may
have
indulge
in
the
pride
of
excel
them
both
in
talent
and
in
energy
!
<EOS>
We
speak
now
of
his
early
day
;
but
even
in
his
maturer
life
,
the
man
,
though
mellow
,
be
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
man
who
now
promise
to
take
to
his
bosom
as
his
own
child
a
poor
bastard
whose
father
be
already
dead
,
and
<EOS>
whose
mother
's
family
be
such
as
the
Scatcherds
!
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
that
the
child
's
history
should
be
know
to
none
.
<EOS>
except
to
the
mother
's
brother
it
be
an
object
of
interest
to
no
one
.
<EOS>
the
mother
have
for
some
short
time
be
talk
of
;
but
now
the
nine
-
day
"
wonder
be
a
wonder
no
longer
.
<EOS>
She
go
off
to
her
far
-
away
home
;
her
husband
's
generosity
be
duly
chronicle
in
the
paper
,
and
the
babe
be
leave
untalked
of
and
unknown
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
explain
to
Scatcherd
that
the
child
have
not
live
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
parting
interview
between
the
brother
and
sister
in
the
jail
,
during
which
,
with
real
tear
and
unaffected
sorrow
,
the
mother
thus
account
for
the
offspring
of
her
shame
.
<EOS>
then
she
start
,
fortunate
in
her
come
fortune
;
and
the
doctor
take
with
him
his
charge
to
the
new
country
in
which
they
be
both
to
live
.
<EOS>
there
he
find
for
her
a
fitting
home
till
she
should
be
old
enough
to
sit
at
his
table
and
live
in
his
bachelor
house
;
and
no
one
but
old
Mr
Gresham
know
who
she
be
,
or
whence
she
have
come
.
  
<EOS>
then
Roger
Scatcherd
,
have
complete
his
six
month
"
confinement
,
come
out
of
prison
.
  
<EOS>
Roger
Scatcherd
,
though
his
hand
be
now
red
with
blood
,
be
to
be
pity
.
<EOS>
a
short
time
before
the
day
of
Henry
Thorne
's
death
he
have
marry
a
young
wife
in
his
own
class
of
life
,
and
have
make
many
resolve
that
henceforward
his
conduct
should
be
such
as
may
become
a
married
man
,
and
may
not
disgrace
the
respectable
brother
-
in
-
law
<EOS>
he
be
about
to
have
give
him
.
<EOS>
such
be
his
condition
when
he
first
hear
of
his
sister
's
plight
.
<EOS>
as
have
be
say
,
he
fill
himself
with
drink
and
start
off
on
the
scent
of
blood
.
  
<EOS>
during
his
prison
day
his
wife
have
to
support
herself
as
she
may
.
<EOS>
the
decent
article
of
furniture
which
they
have
put
together
be
sell
;
she
give
up
their
little
house
,
and
,
bow
down
by
misery
,
she
also
be
bring
near
to
death
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
liberate
he
at
once
get
work
;
but
those
who
have
watch
the
life
of
such
people
know
how
hard
it
be
for
them
to
recover
lose
ground
.
<EOS>
She
become
a
mother
immediately
after
his
liberation
,
and
when
her
child
be
bear
they
be
in
dire
want
;
for
Scatcherd
be
again
drink
,
and
his
resolve
be
blow
to
the
wind
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
be
then
live
at
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
He
have
go
over
there
before
the
day
on
which
he
undertake
the
charge
of
poor
Mary
's
baby
,
and
soon
find
himself
settle
as
the
Greshamsbury
doctor
.
<EOS>
this
occur
very
soon
after
the
birth
of
the
young
heir
.
<EOS>
His
predecessor
in
this
career
have
"
better
"
himself
,
or
endeavour
to
do
so
,
by
seek
the
practice
of
some
large
town
,
and
Lady
Arabella
,
at
a
very
critical
time
,
be
absolutely
leave
with
no
other
advice
than
that
of
a
stranger
,
pick
up
,
as
she
declare
to
Lady
de
Courcy
,
somewhere
about
Barchester
jail
,
or
Barchester
court
-
house
,
she
do
not
know
which
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
Lady
Arabella
could
not
suckle
the
young
heir
herself
.
<EOS>
Ladies
Arabella
never
can
.
<EOS>
They
be
gift
with
the
power
of
be
mother
,
but
not
nursing
-
mother
.
<EOS>
nature
give
them
bosom
for
show
,
but
not
for
use
.
<EOS>
so
Lady
Arabella
have
a
wet
-
nurse
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
six
month
the
new
doctor
find
Master
Frank
be
not
do
quite
so
well
as
he
should
do
;
and
after
a
little
trouble
it
be
discover
that
the
very
excellent
young
woman
who
have
be
send
express
from
Courcy
Castle
to
Greshamsbury
 
<EOS>
a
supply
be
keep
up
on
the
lord
's
demesne
for
the
family
use
 
be
fond
of
brandy
.
<EOS>
She
be
at
once
send
back
to
the
castle
,
of
course
;
and
,
as
Lady
de
Courcy
be
too
much
in
dudgeon
to
send
another
,
Dr
Thorne
be
allow
to
procure
one
.
<EOS>
He
think
of
the
misery
of
Roger
Scatcherd
's
wife
,
think
also
of
her
health
,
and
strength
,
and
active
habit
;
and
thus
Mrs
Scatcherd
become
the
foster
-
mother
to
young
Frank
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
one
other
episode
we
must
tell
of
past
time
.
<EOS>
previous
to
his
father
's
death
,
Dr
Thorne
be
in
love
.
<EOS>
nor
have
he
altogether
sighed
and
plead
in
vain
;
though
it
have
not
quite
come
to
that
,
that
the
young
lady
's
friend
,
or
even
the
young
lady
herself
,
have
actually
accept
his
suit
.
<EOS>
at
that
time
his
name
stand
well
in
Barchester
.
<EOS>
His
father
be
a
prebendary
;
his
cousin
and
his
good
friend
be
the
Thornes
of
Ullathorne
,
and
the
lady
,
who
shall
be
nameless
,
be
not
think
to
be
injudicious
in
listen
to
the
young
doctor
.
<EOS>
but
when
Henry
Thorne
go
so
far
astray
,
when
the
old
doctor
die
,
when
the
young
doctor
quarrel
with
Ullathorne
,
when
the
brother
be
kill
in
a
disgraceful
quarrel
,
and
it
turn
out
that
the
physician
have
nothing
but
his
profession
and
no
settle
locality
in
which
to
exercise
it
;
then
,
indeed
,
the
young
lady
's
friend
think
that
she
be
injudicious
,
and
the
young
lady
herself
have
not
spirit
enough
,
or
love
enough
,
to
be
disobedient
.
<EOS>
in
those
stormy
day
of
the
trial
she
tell
Dr
Thorne
that
perhaps
it
would
be
wise
that
they
should
not
see
each
other
any
more
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
,
so
counselled
,
at
such
a
moment
,
 
so
informed
then
,
when
he
most
require
comfort
from
his
love
,
at
once
swear
loudly
that
he
agree
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
rush
forth
with
a
burst
heart
,
and
say
to
himself
that
the
world
be
bad
,
all
bad
.
<EOS>
He
see
the
lady
no
more
;
and
,
if
I
be
rightly
inform
,
never
again
make
matrimonial
overture
to
any
one
.
   
<EOS>
Dr
thorne
 
<EOS>
and
thus
Dr
Thorne
become
settle
for
life
in
the
little
village
of
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
as
be
then
the
will
not
with
many
country
practitioner
,
and
as
should
be
the
will
not
with
them
all
if
they
consult
their
own
dignity
a
little
less
and
the
comfort
of
their
customer
somewhat
more
,
he
add
the
business
of
a
dispense
apothecary
to
that
of
physician
.
<EOS>
in
do
so
,
he
be
of
course
much
revile
.
<EOS>
many
people
around
him
declare
that
he
could
not
truly
be
a
doctor
,
or
,
at
any
rate
,
a
doctor
to
be
so
call
;
and
his
brother
in
the
art
live
around
him
,
though
they
know
that
his
diploma
,
degree
,
and
certificate
be
all
_
en
règle
<EOS>
_
,
rather
countenance
the
report
.
<EOS>
there
be
much
about
this
new
-
comer
which
do
not
endear
him
to
his
own
profession
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
he
be
a
new
-
comer
,
and
,
as
such
,
be
of
course
to
be
regard
by
other
doctor
as
be
<EOS>
_
de
trop
_
.
<EOS>
Greshamsbury
be
only
fifteen
mile
from
Barchester
,
where
there
be
a
regular
dépôt
of
medical
skill
,
and
but
eight
from
Silverbridge
,
where
a
properly
establish
physician
have
be
in
residence
for
the
last
forty
year
.
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
's
predecessor
at
Greshamsbury
have
be
a
humble
-
minded
general
practitioner
,
gift
with
a
due
respect
for
the
physician
of
the
county
;
and
he
,
though
he
have
be
allow
to
physic
the
servant
,
and
sometimes
the
child
of
Greshamsbury
,
have
never
have
the
presumption
to
put
himself
on
a
par
with
his
better
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
also
,
Dr
Thorne
,
though
a
graduate
physician
,
though
entitle
beyond
all
dispute
to
call
himself
a
doctor
,
accord
to
all
the
law
of
all
the
college
,
make
it
known
to
the
East
Barsetshire
world
,
very
soon
after
he
have
seat
himself
at
Greshamsbury
,
that
his
rate
of
pay
be
to
be
seven
-
and
-
sixpence
a
visit
within
a
circuit
of
five
mile
,
with
a
proportionally
increase
charge
at
proportionally
increase
distance
.
<EOS>
now
there
be
something
low
,
mean
,
unprofessional
,
and
democratic
in
this
;
so
,
at
least
,
say
the
child
of
Æsculapius
gather
together
in
conclave
at
Barchester
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
it
show
that
this
Thorne
be
always
think
of
his
money
,
like
an
apothecary
,
as
he
be
;
whereas
,
it
would
have
behove
him
,
as
a
physician
,
have
he
have
the
feeling
of
a
physician
under
his
hat
,
to
have
regard
his
own
pursuit
in
a
purely
philosophical
spirit
,
and
to
have
take
any
gain
which
may
have
accrue
as
an
accidental
adjunct
to
his
station
in
life
.
<EOS>
a
physician
should
take
his
fee
without
let
<EOS>
his
left
hand
know
what
his
right
hand
be
do
;
it
should
be
take
without
a
thought
,
without
a
look
,
without
a
move
of
the
facial
muscle
;
the
true
physician
should
hardly
be
aware
that
the
last
friendly
grasp
of
the
hand
have
be
make
more
precious
by
the
touch
of
gold
.
<EOS>
whereas
,
that
fellow
Thorne
would
lug
out
half
a
crown
from
his
breech
pocket
and
give
it
in
change
for
a
ten
shill
piece
.
<EOS>
and
then
it
be
clear
that
this
man
have
no
appreciation
of
the
dignity
of
a
learned
profession
.
<EOS>
He
may
constantly
be
see
compound
medicine
in
the
shop
,
at
the
left
hand
of
his
front
door
;
not
make
experiment
philosophically
in
materia
medica
for
the
benefit
of
come
age
 
which
,
if
he
do
,
he
should
have
do
in
the
seclusion
of
his
study
,
far
from
profane
eye
 
but
positively
put
together
common
powder
for
rural
bowel
,
or
spread
vulgar
ointment
for
agricultural
ailment
.
  
<EOS>
a
man
of
this
sort
be
not
fit
society
for
Dr
Fillgrave
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
that
must
be
admit
.
<EOS>
and
yet
he
have
be
find
to
be
fit
society
for
the
old
squire
of
Greshamsbury
,
whose
shoe
-
ribbon
<EOS>
Dr
Fillgrave
would
not
have
object
to
tie
;
so
high
do
the
old
squire
stand
in
the
county
just
previous
to
his
death
.
<EOS>
but
the
spirit
of
the
Lady
Arabella
be
know
by
the
medical
profession
of
Barsetshire
,
and
when
that
good
man
die
it
be
feel
that
Thorne
's
short
tenure
of
Greshamsbury
favour
be
already
over
.
<EOS>
the
Barsetshire
regular
be
,
however
,
doom
to
disappointment
.
<EOS>
Our
doctor
have
already
contrive
to
endear
himself
to
the
heir
;
and
though
there
be
not
even
then
much
personal
love
between
him
and
the
Lady
Arabella
,
he
keep
his
place
at
the
great
house
unmove
,
not
only
in
the
nursery
and
in
the
bedroom
,
but
also
at
the
squire
's
dining
-
table
.
  
<EOS>
now
there
be
in
this
<EOS>
,
it
must
be
admit
,
quite
enough
to
make
him
unpopular
with
his
brother
;
and
this
feeling
be
soon
show
in
a
marked
and
dignified
manner
.
<EOS>
Dr
Fillgrave
,
who
have
certainly
the
most
respectable
professional
connexion
in
the
county
,
who
have
a
reputation
to
maintain
,
and
who
be
accustom
to
meet
,
on
almost
equal
term
,
the
great
medical
baronet
from
the
metropolis
at
the
house
of
the
nobility
 
<EOS>
Dr
Fillgrave
decline
to
meet
Dr
Thorne
in
consultation
.
<EOS>
He
exceedingly
regret
,
he
say
,
most
exceedingly
,
the
necessity
which
he
feel
of
do
so
:
he
have
never
before
have
to
perform
so
painful
a
duty
;
but
,
as
a
duty
which
he
owe
to
his
profession
,
he
must
perform
it
.
<EOS>
with
every
feeling
of
respect
for
Lady
 
---
,
a
sick
guest
at
Greshamsbury
 
and
for
Mr
Gresham
,
he
must
decline
to
attend
in
conjunction
with
Dr
Thorne
.
<EOS>
if
his
service
could
be
make
available
under
any
other
circumstance
,
he
would
go
to
Greshamsbury
as
fast
as
post
-
horse
could
carry
him
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
indeed
,
there
be
war
in
Barsetshire
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
on
Dr
Thorne
's
cranium
one
bump
more
developed
than
another
,
it
be
that
of
combativeness
.
<EOS>
not
that
the
doctor
be
a
bully
,
or
even
pugnacious
,
in
the
usual
sense
of
the
word
;
he
have
no
disposition
to
provoke
a
fight
,
no
propense
love
of
quarrel
;
but
there
be
that
in
him
which
would
allow
him
to
yield
to
no
attack
.
<EOS>
neither
in
argument
nor
in
contest
would
he
ever
allow
himself
to
be
wrong
;
never
at
least
to
any
one
but
to
himself
;
and
on
behalf
of
his
special
hobby
,
he
be
ready
to
meet
the
world
at
large
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
therefore
be
understand
,
that
when
such
a
gauntlet
be
thus
throw
in
his
very
tooth
by
Dr
Fillgrave
,
he
be
not
slow
to
take
it
up
.
<EOS>
He
address
a
letter
to
the
Barsetshire
Conservative
_
Standard
_
,
in
which
he
attack
Dr
fillgrave
with
some
considerable
acerbity
.
<EOS>
Dr
Fillgrave
respond
in
four
line
,
say
that
on
mature
consideration
he
have
make
up
his
mind
not
to
notice
any
remark
that
may
be
make
on
him
by
Dr
Thorne
in
the
public
press
.
<EOS>
the
Greshamsbury
doctor
then
write
another
letter
,
more
witty
and
much
more
severe
than
the
last
;
and
as
this
be
copy
into
the
Bristol
,
Exeter
,
and
Gloucester
paper
,
Dr
Fillgrave
find
it
very
difficult
to
maintain
the
magnanimity
of
his
reticence
.
<EOS>
It
be
sometimes
become
enough
for
a
man
to
wrap
himself
in
the
dignified
toga
of
silence
,
and
proclaim
himself
indifferent
to
public
attack
;
but
it
be
a
sort
of
dignity
which
it
be
very
difficult
to
maintain
.
<EOS>
as
well
may
a
man
,
when
sting
to
madness
by
wasp
,
endeavour
to
sit
in
his
chair
without
move
a
muscle
,
as
endure
with
patience
and
without
reply
the
courtesy
of
a
newspaper
opponent
.
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
write
a
third
letter
,
which
be
too
much
for
medical
flesh
and
blood
to
bear
.
<EOS>
Dr
Fillgrave
answer
it
,
not
,
indeed
,
in
his
own
name
,
but
in
that
of
a
brother
doctor
;
and
then
the
war
rage
merrily
.
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
Dr
Fillgrave
never
know
another
happy
hour
.
<EOS>
have
he
dream
of
what
material
be
make
that
young
compounder
of
dose
at
Greshamsbury
he
would
have
meet
him
in
consultation
,
morning
,
noon
,
and
night
,
without
objection
;
but
have
begin
the
war
,
he
be
constrain
to
go
on
with
it
:
his
brother
would
allow
him
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
thus
he
be
continually
be
bring
up
to
the
fight
,
as
a
prize
-
fighter
may
be
see
to
be
,
who
be
carry
up
round
after
round
,
without
any
hope
on
his
own
part
,
and
who
,
in
each
round
,
drop
to
the
ground
before
the
very
wind
of
his
opponent
's
blow
.
  
<EOS>
but
Dr
Fillgrave
,
though
thus
weak
himself
,
be
back
in
practice
and
in
countenance
by
nearly
all
his
brother
in
the
county
.
<EOS>
the
guinea
fee
,
the
principle
of
_
give
_
advice
and
of
sell
no
medicine
,
the
great
resolve
to
keep
a
distinct
barrier
between
the
physician
and
the
apothecary
,
and
,
above
all
,
the
hatred
of
the
contamination
of
a
bill
,
be
strong
in
the
medical
mind
of
Barsetshire
.
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
have
the
provincial
medical
world
against
him
,
and
so
he
appeal
to
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
the
_
Lancet
_
take
the
matter
up
in
his
favour
,
but
the
_
Journal
of
Medical
Science
<EOS>
_
be
against
him
;
the
_
Weekly
Chirurgeon
_
,
note
for
its
medical
democracy
,
uphold
him
as
a
medical
prophet
,
but
the
_
Scalping
Knife
_
,
a
monthly
periodical
get
up
in
dead
opposition
to
the
_
Lancet
_
,
show
him
no
mercy
.
<EOS>
so
the
war
go
on
,
and
our
doctor
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
become
a
note
character
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
,
moreover
,
other
difficulty
to
encounter
in
his
professional
career
.
<EOS>
It
be
something
in
his
favour
that
he
understand
his
business
;
something
that
he
be
willing
to
labour
at
it
with
energy
;
and
resolve
to
labour
at
it
conscientiously
.
<EOS>
He
have
also
other
gift
,
such
as
conversational
brilliancy
,
an
aptitude
for
true
good
fellowship
,
firmness
in
friendship
,
and
general
honesty
of
disposition
,
which
stand
him
in
stead
as
he
advance
in
life
.
<EOS>
but
,
at
his
first
starting
,
much
that
belong
to
himself
personally
be
against
him
.
<EOS>
let
him
enter
what
house
he
would
,
he
enter
it
with
a
conviction
,
often
express
to
himself
,
that
he
be
equal
as
a
man
to
the
proprietor
,
equal
as
a
human
being
to
the
proprietress
.
<EOS>
to
age
he
would
allow
deference
,
and
to
special
recognise
talent
 
at
least
so
he
say
;
to
rank
also
,
he
would
pay
that
respect
which
be
its
clear
and
recognise
prerogative
;
he
would
let
a
lord
walk
out
of
a
room
before
him
if
he
do
not
happen
to
forget
it
;
in
speak
to
a
duke
he
would
address
him
as
his
grace
;
and
he
would
in
no
way
assume
a
familiarity
with
big
man
than
himself
,
allow
to
the
big
man
the
privilege
of
make
the
first
advance
.
<EOS>
but
beyond
this
he
would
admit
that
no
man
should
walk
the
earth
with
his
head
higher
than
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
talk
of
these
thing
much
;
he
offend
no
rank
by
boast
of
his
own
equality
;
he
do
not
absolutely
tell
the
Earl
de
Courcy
in
word
,
that
the
privilege
of
dining
at
Courcy
Castle
be
to
him
no
great
than
the
privilege
of
dining
at
Courcy
Parsonage
;
but
there
be
that
in
his
manner
that
tell
it
.
<EOS>
the
feeling
in
itself
be
perhaps
good
,
and
be
certainly
much
justify
by
the
manner
in
which
he
bear
himself
to
those
below
him
in
rank
;
but
there
be
folly
in
the
resolution
to
run
counter
to
the
world
's
recognise
rule
on
such
matter
;
and
much
absurdity
in
his
mode
of
do
so
,
see
that
at
heart
he
be
a
thorough
conservative
.
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
he
naturally
hate
a
lord
at
first
sight
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
would
have
expend
his
mean
,
his
blood
,
and
spirit
,
in
fighting
for
the
upper
house
of
Parliament
.
  
<EOS>
such
a
disposition
,
until
it
be
thoroughly
understand
,
do
not
tend
to
ingratiate
him
with
the
wife
of
the
country
gentleman
among
whom
he
have
to
look
for
practice
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
also
,
there
be
not
much
in
his
individual
manner
to
recommend
him
to
the
favour
of
lady
.
<EOS>
He
be
brusque
,
authoritative
,
give
to
contradiction
,
rough
<EOS>
though
never
dirty
in
his
personal
belonging
,
and
incline
to
indulge
in
a
sort
of
quiet
raillery
,
which
sometimes
be
not
thoroughly
understand
.
<EOS>
People
do
not
always
know
whether
he
be
laugh
at
them
or
with
them
;
and
some
people
be
,
perhaps
,
incline
to
think
that
a
doctor
should
not
laugh
at
all
when
call
in
to
act
doctorially
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
be
know
,
indeed
,
when
the
core
of
the
fruit
have
be
reach
,
when
the
huge
proportion
of
that
love
trust
heart
have
be
learn
,
and
understand
,
and
appreciate
,
when
that
honesty
have
be
recognise
,
that
manly
,
and
almost
womanly
tenderness
have
be
feel
,
then
,
indeed
,
the
doctor
be
acknowledge
to
be
adequate
in
his
profession
.
<EOS>
to
trifle
ailment
he
be
too
often
brusque
.
<EOS>
see
that
he
accept
money
for
the
cure
of
<EOS>
such
,
he
should
,
we
may
say
,
have
cure
them
without
an
offensive
manner
.
<EOS>
so
far
he
be
without
defence
.
<EOS>
but
to
real
suffer
no
one
find
him
brusque
;
no
patient
lie
painfully
on
a
bed
of
sickness
ever
think
him
rough
.
  
<EOS>
another
misfortune
be
,
that
he
be
a
bachelor
.
<EOS>
lady
think
,
and
I
,
for
one
,
think
that
lady
be
quite
right
in
so
think
,
that
doctor
should
be
married
man
.
<EOS>
all
the
world
feel
that
a
man
when
married
acquire
some
of
the
attribute
of
an
old
woman
 
<EOS>
he
become
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
a
motherly
sort
of
be
;
he
acquire
a
conversance
with
woman
's
way
and
woman
's
want
,
and
lose
the
wild
and
offensive
spark
of
his
virility
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
easy
to
talk
to
such
a
one
about
Matilda
's
stomach
,
and
the
grow
pain
in
Fanny
's
leg
,
than
to
a
young
bachelor
.
<EOS>
this
impediment
also
stand
much
in
Dr
Thorne
's
way
during
his
first
year
at
Greshamsbury
.
  
<EOS>
but
his
want
be
not
at
first
great
;
and
though
his
ambition
be
perhaps
high
,
it
be
not
of
an
impatient
nature
.
<EOS>
the
world
be
his
oyster
;
but
,
circumstance
as
he
be
,
he
know
that
it
be
not
for
him
to
open
it
with
his
lancet
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
He
have
bread
to
earn
,
which
he
must
earn
wearily
;
he
have
a
character
to
make
,
which
must
come
slowly
;
it
satisfy
his
soul
that
,
in
addition
to
his
immortal
hope
,
he
have
a
possible
future
in
this
world
to
which
he
could
look
forward
with
clear
eye
,
and
advance
with
a
heart
that
would
know
no
fainting
.
  
<EOS>
on
his
first
arrival
at
Greshamsbury
he
have
be
put
by
the
squire
into
a
house
,
which
he
still
occupy
when
that
squire
's
grandson
come
of
age
.
<EOS>
there
be
two
decent
,
commodious
,
private
house
in
the
village
 
always
except
the
rectory
,
which
stand
grandly
in
its
own
ground
,
and
,
therefore
,
be
consider
as
rank
above
the
village
residence
 
of
these
two
Dr
Thorne
have
the
small
.
<EOS>
They
stand
exactly
at
the
angle
before
describe
,
on
the
outer
side
of
it
,
and
at
right
angle
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
They
both
possess
good
stable
and
ample
garden
;
and
it
may
be
as
well
to
specify
,
that
Mr
Umbleby
,
the
agent
and
lawyer
to
the
estate
,
occupy
the
large
one
.
  
<EOS>
here
Dr
Thorne
live
for
eleven
or
twelve
year
,
all
alone
;
and
then
for
ten
or
eleven
more
with
his
niece
,
Mary
Thorne
.
<EOS>
Mary
be
thirteen
when
she
come
to
take
up
permanent
abode
as
mistress
of
the
establishment
 
or
,
at
any
rate
,
to
act
as
the
only
mistress
which
the
establishment
possess
.
<EOS>
this
advent
greatly
change
the
tenor
of
the
doctor
's
way
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
before
pure
bachelor
;
not
a
room
in
his
house
have
be
comfortably
furnish
;
he
at
first
commence
in
a
makeshift
sort
of
way
,
because
he
have
not
at
his
command
<EOS>
the
mean
of
commence
otherwise
;
and
he
have
go
on
in
the
same
fashion
,
because
the
exact
time
have
never
come
at
which
it
be
imperative
in
him
to
set
his
house
in
order
.
<EOS>
He
have
have
no
fix
hour
for
his
meal
,
no
fix
place
for
his
book
,
no
fixed
wardrobe
for
his
clothe
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
few
bottle
of
good
wine
in
his
cellar
,
and
occasionally
ask
a
brother
bachelor
to
take
a
chop
with
him
;
but
beyond
this
he
have
touch
very
little
on
the
care
of
housekeeping
.
<EOS>
a
slop
-
bowl
full
of
strong
tea
,
together
with
bread
,
and
butter
,
and
egg
,
be
produce
for
him
in
the
morning
,
and
he
expect
that
at
whatever
hour
he
may
arrive
in
the
evening
,
some
food
should
be
present
to
him
wherewith
to
satisfy
the
craving
of
nature
;
<EOS>
if
,
in
addition
to
this
,
he
have
another
slop
-
bowl
of
tea
in
the
evening
,
he
get
all
that
he
ever
require
,
or
all
,
at
least
,
that
he
ever
demand
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
Mary
come
,
or
rather
,
when
she
be
about
to
come
,
thing
be
altogether
change
at
the
doctor
's
.
<EOS>
People
have
hitherto
wonder
 
and
especially
Mrs
Umbleby
 
<EOS>
how
a
gentleman
like
Dr
Thorne
could
continue
to
live
in
so
slovenly
a
manner
;
and
how
people
again
wonder
,
and
again
especially
Mrs
Umbleby
,
how
the
doctor
could
possibly
think
it
necessary
to
put
such
a
lot
of
furniture
into
a
house
because
a
little
chit
of
a
girl
of
twelve
year
of
age
be
come
to
live
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Umbleby
have
great
scope
for
her
wonder
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
make
a
thorough
revolution
in
his
household
,
and
furnish
his
house
from
the
ground
to
the
roof
completely
.
<EOS>
He
paint
 
for
the
first
time
since
the
commencement
of
his
tenancy
 
he
paper
,
he
carpet
,
and
curtain
,
and
mirror
,
and
linene
,
and
blanket
,
as
though
a
Mrs
Thorne
with
a
good
fortune
be
come
home
to
-
morrow
;
and
all
for
a
girl
of
twelve
year
old
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
how
,
"
say
Mrs
Umbleby
,
to
her
friend
Miss
Gushing
,
"
how
do
he
find
out
what
to
buy
?
<EOS>
"
as
though
the
doctor
have
be
bring
up
like
a
wild
beast
,
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
table
and
chair
,
and
with
no
more
developed
idea
of
drawing
-
room
drapery
than
an
hippopotamus
.
  
<EOS>
to
the
utter
amazement
of
Mrs
Umbleby
and
Miss
Gushing
,
the
doctor
do
it
all
very
well
.
<EOS>
He
say
nothing
about
it
to
any
one
 
he
never
do
say
much
about
such
thing
 
<EOS>
but
he
furnish
his
house
well
and
discreetly
;
and
when
Mary
Thorne
come
home
from
her
school
at
Bath
,
to
which
she
have
be
take
some
six
year
previously
,
she
find
herself
call
upon
to
be
the
preside
genius
of
a
perfect
paradise
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
say
that
the
doctor
have
manage
to
endear
himself
to
the
new
squire
before
the
old
squire
's
death
,
and
that
,
therefore
,
the
change
at
Greshamsbury
have
have
no
professional
ill
effect
upon
him
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
case
at
the
time
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
all
do
not
go
smoothly
in
the
Greshamsbury
medical
department
.
<EOS>
there
be
six
or
seven
year
"
difference
in
age
between
Mr
Gresham
and
the
doctor
,
and
,
moreover
,
Mr
Gresham
be
young
for
his
age
,
and
the
doctor
old
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
there
be
a
very
close
attachment
between
them
early
in
life
.
<EOS>
this
be
never
thoroughly
sunder
,
and
,
back
by
this
,
the
doctor
do
maintain
himself
for
some
year
before
the
fire
of
Lady
Arabella
's
artillery
.
<EOS>
but
drop
fall
,
if
they
fall
constantly
,
will
bore
through
a
stone
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
's
pretension
,
mix
with
his
subversive
professional
democratic
tendency
,
his
seven
-
and
-
sixpenny
visit
,
add
to
his
utter
disregard
of
Lady
Arabella
's
air
,
be
too
much
for
her
spirit
.
<EOS>
He
bring
Frank
through
his
first
trouble
,
and
that
at
first
ingratiate
her
;
he
be
equally
successful
with
the
early
dietary
of
Augusta
and
Beatrice
;
but
,
as
his
success
be
obtain
in
direct
opposition
to
the
Courcy
Castle
nursery
principle
,
this
hardly
do
much
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
when
the
third
daughter
be
bear
,
he
at
once
declare
that
she
be
a
very
weakly
flower
,
and
sternly
forbid
the
mother
to
go
to
London
.
<EOS>
the
mother
,
love
her
babe
,
obey
;
but
do
not
the
less
hate
<EOS>
the
doctor
for
the
order
,
which
she
firmly
believe
be
give
at
the
instance
and
express
dictation
of
Mr
Gresham
.
<EOS>
then
another
little
girl
come
into
the
world
,
and
the
doctor
be
more
imperative
than
ever
as
to
the
nursery
rule
and
the
excellence
of
country
air
.
<EOS>
quarrel
be
thus
engender
,
and
Lady
Arabella
be
teach
to
believe
that
this
doctor
of
her
husband
's
be
after
all
no
Solomon
.
<EOS>
in
her
husband
's
absence
she
send
for
Dr
Fillgrave
,
give
very
express
intimation
that
he
would
not
have
to
wound
either
his
eye
or
dignity
by
encounter
his
enemy
;
and
she
find
Dr
fillgrave
a
great
comfort
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
then
Dr
Thorne
give
Mr
Gresham
to
understand
that
,
under
such
circumstance
,
he
could
not
visit
professionally
at
Greshamsbury
any
longer
.
<EOS>
the
poor
squire
see
there
be
no
help
for
it
,
and
though
he
still
maintain
his
friendly
connexion
with
his
neighbour
,
the
seven
-
and
-
sixpenny
visit
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
Dr
fillgrave
from
Barchester
,
and
the
gentleman
at
Silverbridge
,
divide
the
responsibility
between
them
,
and
the
nursery
principle
of
Courcy
Castle
be
again
in
vogue
at
Greshamsbury
.
  
<EOS>
so
thing
go
on
for
year
,
and
those
year
be
year
of
sorrow
.
<EOS>
We
must
not
ascribe
to
our
doctor
's
enemy
the
suffering
,
and
sickness
,
and
death
that
occur
.
<EOS>
the
four
frail
little
one
that
die
would
probably
have
be
take
have
Lady
Arabella
be
more
tolerant
of
Dr
Thorne
.
<EOS>
but
the
fact
be
,
that
they
do
die
;
and
that
the
mother
's
heart
then
get
the
well
of
the
woman
's
pride
,
and
Lady
Arabella
humble
herself
before
Dr
Thorne
.
<EOS>
She
humble
herself
,
or
would
have
do
so
,
have
the
doctor
permit
her
.
<EOS>
but
he
,
with
his
eye
full
of
tear
,
stop
the
utterance
of
her
apology
,
take
her
two
hand
in
his
,
press
them
warmly
,
and
assure
her
that
his
joy
in
return
would
be
great
,
for
the
love
that
he
bear
to
all
that
belong
to
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
and
so
the
seven
-
and
-
sixpenny
visit
be
recommence
;
and
the
great
triumph
of
Dr
Fillgrave
come
to
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
Great
be
the
joy
in
the
Greshamsbury
nursery
when
the
second
change
take
place
.
<EOS>
among
the
doctor
's
attribute
,
not
hitherto
mention
,
be
an
aptitude
for
the
society
of
child
.
<EOS>
He
delight
to
talk
to
child
,
and
to
play
with
them
.
<EOS>
He
would
carry
them
on
his
back
,
three
or
four
at
a
time
,
roll
with
them
on
the
ground
,
race
with
them
in
the
garden
,
invent
game
for
them
,
contrive
amusement
in
circumstance
which
seem
quite
adverse
to
all
manner
of
delight
;
and
,
above
all
,
his
physic
be
not
nearly
so
nasty
as
that
which
come
from
Silverbridge
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
a
great
theory
as
to
the
happiness
of
child
;
and
though
he
be
not
dispose
altogether
to
throw
over
the
precept
of
Solomon
 
always
bargain
that
he
should
,
under
no
circumstance
,
be
himself
the
executioner
 
<EOS>
he
argue
that
the
principal
duty
which
a
parent
owe
to
a
child
be
to
make
him
happy
.
<EOS>
not
only
be
the
man
to
be
make
happy
 
<EOS>
the
future
man
<EOS>
,
if
that
may
be
possible
 
but
the
exist
boy
be
to
be
treat
with
equal
favour
;
and
his
happiness
,
so
say
the
doctor
,
be
of
much
easy
attainment
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
struggle
after
future
advantage
at
the
expense
of
present
pain
,
see
that
the
result
be
so
very
doubtful
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
many
an
opponent
of
the
doctor
have
think
to
catch
him
on
the
hip
when
so
singular
a
doctrine
be
broach
;
but
they
be
not
always
successful
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
!
"
say
his
sensible
enemy
,
"
be
Johnny
not
to
be
teach
to
read
because
he
do
not
like
it
?
"
<EOS>
"
Johnny
must
read
by
all
mean
,
"
would
the
doctor
answer
;
"
but
be
it
necessary
that
he
should
not
like
it
?
<EOS>
if
the
preceptor
have
it
in
him
,
may
not
Johnny
learn
,
not
only
to
read
,
but
to
like
to
learn
to
read
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
would
say
his
enemy
,
"
child
must
be
control
.
"
<EOS>
"
and
so
must
man
also
,
"
would
say
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
not
steal
your
peach
,
nor
make
love
to
your
wife
,
nor
libel
your
character
.
<EOS>
much
as
I
may
wish
through
my
natural
depravity
to
indulge
in
such
vice
,
I
be
debar
from
them
without
pain
,
and
I
may
almost
say
without
unhappiness
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
the
argument
go
on
,
neither
party
convince
the
other
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
the
meantime
,
the
child
of
the
neighbourhood
become
very
fond
of
Dr
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
and
the
squire
be
still
fast
friend
,
but
circumstance
have
occur
,
spread
themselves
now
over
a
period
of
many
year
,
which
almost
make
the
poor
squire
uneasy
in
the
doctor
's
company
.
<EOS>
Mr
Gresham
owe
a
large
sum
of
money
,
and
he
have
,
moreover
,
already
sell
a
portion
of
his
property
.
<EOS>
unfortunately
it
have
be
the
pride
of
the
Greshams
that
their
acre
have
descend
from
one
to
another
without
an
entail
,
so
that
each
possessor
of
Greshamsbury
have
have
the
full
power
to
dispose
of
the
property
as
he
please
.
<EOS>
any
doubt
as
to
its
go
to
the
male
heir
have
never
hitherto
be
feel
.
<EOS>
It
have
occasionally
be
encumber
by
charge
for
young
child
;
but
these
charge
have
be
liquidate
,
and
the
property
have
come
down
without
any
burden
to
the
present
squire
.
<EOS>
now
a
portion
of
this
have
be
sell
,
and
it
have
be
sell
to
a
certain
degree
through
the
agency
of
Dr
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
this
make
the
squire
an
unhappy
man
.
<EOS>
no
man
love
his
family
name
and
honour
,
his
old
family
blazon
and
stand
more
thoroughly
than
he
do
;
he
be
every
whit
a
Gresham
at
heart
;
but
his
spirit
have
be
weak
than
that
of
his
forefather
;
and
,
in
his
day
,
for
the
first
time
,
the
Greshams
be
to
go
to
the
wall
!
<EOS>
ten
year
before
the
beginning
of
our
story
it
have
be
necessary
to
raise
a
large
sum
of
money
to
meet
and
pay
off
press
liability
,
and
it
be
find
that
this
could
be
do
with
more
material
advantage
by
sell
a
portion
of
the
property
than
in
any
other
way
.
<EOS>
a
portion
of
it
,
about
a
third
of
the
whole
in
value
,
be
accordingly
sell
.

and
be
know
as
have
the
good
partridge
shoot
in
the
county
;
as
have
on
it
also
a
celebrated
fox
cover
,
Boxall
Gorse
,
hold
in
very
high
repute
by
Barsetshire
sportsman
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
residence
on
the
immediate
estate
,
and
it
be
altogether
divide
from
the
remainder
of
the
Greshamsbury
property
.
<EOS>
this
,
with
many
inward
and
outward
groan
,
Mr
Gresham
permit
to
be
sell
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
sell
,
and
sell
well
,
by
private
contract
to
a
native
of
Barchester
,
who
,
have
rise
from
the
world
's
rank
,
have
make
for
himself
great
wealth
.
<EOS>
somewhat
of
this
man
's
character
must
hereafter
be
tell
;
it
will
suffice
to
say
that
he
rely
for
advice
in
money
matter
upon
Dr
Thorne
,
and
that
at
Dr
Thorne
's
suggestion
he
have
purchase
Boxall
Hill
,
partridge
-
shooting
and
gorse
cover
all
include
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
only
buy
Boxall
Hill
,
but
have
subsequently
lend
the
squire
large
sum
of
money
on
mortgage
,
in
all
which
transaction
the
doctor
have
take
part
.
<EOS>
It
have
therefore
come
to
pass
that
Mr
Gresham
be
not
unfrequently
call
upon
to
discuss
his
money
affair
with
Dr
Thorne
,
and
occasionally
to
submit
to
lecture
and
advice
which
may
perhaps
as
well
have
be
omit
.
  
<EOS>
so
much
for
Dr
Thorne
.
<EOS>
a
few
word
must
still
be
say
about
Miss
Mary
before
we
rush
into
our
story
;
the
crust
will
then
have
be
break
,
and
the
pie
will
be
open
to
the
guest
.
<EOS>
Little
Miss
Mary
be
keep
at
a
farm
-
house
till
she
be
six
;
she
be
then
send
to
school
at
Bath
,
and
transplant
to
the
doctor
's
newly
furnish
house
a
little
more
than
six
year
after
that
.
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
suppose
that
he
have
lose
sight
of
his
charge
during
her
early
year
.
<EOS>
He
be
much
too
well
aware
of
the
nature
of
the
promise
which
he
have
make
to
the
depart
mother
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
He
have
constantly
visit
his
little
niece
,
and
long
before
the
first
twelve
year
of
her
life
be
over
have
lose
all
consciousness
of
his
promise
,
and
of
his
duty
to
the
mother
,
in
the
strong
tie
of
downright
personal
love
for
the
only
creature
that
belong
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mary
come
home
the
doctor
be
like
a
child
in
his
glee
.
<EOS>
He
prepare
surprise
for
her
with
as
much
forethought
and
trouble
as
though
he
be
contrive
mine
to
blow
up
an
enemy
.
<EOS>
He
take
her
first
into
the
shop
,
and
then
into
the
kitchen
,
thence
to
the
dining
-
room
,
after
that
to
his
and
her
bedroom
,
and
so
on
till
he
come
to
the
full
glory
of
the
new
drawing
-
room
,
enhance
the
pleasure
by
little
joke
,
and
tell
her
that
he
should
never
dare
to
come
into
the
last
paradise
without
her
permission
,
and
not
then
till
he
have
take
off
his
boot
.
<EOS>
child
as
she
be
,
she
understand
the
joke
,
and
carry
it
on
like
a
little
queen
;
and
so
they
soon
become
the
firm
of
friend
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
Mary
be
a
queen
,
it
be
still
necessary
that
she
should
be
educate
.
<EOS>
those
be
the
early
day
in
which
Lady
Arabella
have
humble
herself
,
and
to
show
her
humility
she
invite
Mary
to
share
the
music
-
lesson
of
Augusta
and
Beatrice
at
the
great
house
.
<EOS>
a
music
-
master
from
Barchester
come
over
three
time
a
week
,
and
remain
for
three
hour
,
and
if
the
doctor
choose
to
send
his
girl
over
,
she
could
pick
up
what
be
go
on
without
do
any
harm
.
<EOS>
so
say
the
Lady
Arabella
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
with
many
thank
and
with
no
hesitation
,
accept
the
offer
,
merely
add
,
that
he
have
perhaps
better
settle
separately
with
Signor
Cantabili
,
the
music
-
master
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
much
oblige
to
Lady
Arabella
for
give
his
little
girl
permission
to
join
her
lesson
to
those
of
the
Miss
Greshams
.
  
<EOS>
It
nee
hardly
be
say
that
the
Lady
Arabella
be
on
fire
at
once
.
<EOS>
settle
with
Signor
Cantabili
!
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
;
she
would
do
that
;
there
must
be
no
expense
whatever
incur
in
such
an
arrangement
on
Miss
Thorne
's
account
!
<EOS>
but
here
,
as
in
most
thing
,
the
doctor
carry
his
point
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
time
of
the
lady
's
humility
,
she
could
not
make
as
good
a
fight
as
she
would
otherwise
have
do
;
and
thus
she
find
,
to
her
great
disgust
,
that
Mary
Thorne
be
learn
music
in
her
schoolroom
on
equal
term
,
as
regard
payment
,
with
her
own
daughter
.
<EOS>
the
arrangement
have
be
make
could
not
be
break
,
especially
as
the
young
lady
in
nowise
make
herself
disagreeable
;
and
more
especially
as
the
Miss
Greshams
themselves
be
very
fond
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
Mary
Thorne
learn
music
at
Greshamsbury
,
and
with
her
music
she
learn
other
thing
also
;
how
to
behave
herself
among
girl
of
her
own
age
;
how
to
speak
and
talk
as
other
young
lady
do
;
how
to
dress
herself
,
and
how
to
move
and
walk
.
<EOS>
all
which
,
she
,
be
quick
to
learn
,
learn
without
trouble
at
the
great
house
.
<EOS>
something
also
she
learn
of
French
,
see
that
the
Greshamsbury
french
governess
be
always
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
,
some
few
year
later
,
there
come
a
rector
,
and
a
rector
's
sister
;
and
with
the
latter
Mary
study
German
,
and
French
also
.
<EOS>
from
the
doctor
himself
she
learn
much
;
the
choice
,
namely
,
of
English
book
for
her
own
reading
,
and
habit
of
think
somewhat
akin
to
his
own
,
though
modify
by
the
feminine
softness
of
her
individual
mind
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
Mary
Thorne
grow
up
and
be
educate
.
<EOS>
of
her
personal
appearance
it
certainly
be
my
business
as
an
author
to
say
something
.
<EOS>
She
be
my
heroine
,
and
,
as
such
,
must
necessarily
be
very
beautiful
;
but
,
in
truth
,
her
mind
and
inner
quality
be
more
clearly
distinct
to
my
brain
than
her
outward
form
and
feature
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
she
be
far
from
be
tall
,
and
far
from
be
showy
;
that
her
foot
and
hand
be
small
and
delicate
;
that
her
eye
be
bright
when
look
at
,
but
not
brilliant
so
as
to
make
their
brilliancy
palpably
visible
to
all
around
her
;
her
hair
be
dark
brown
,
and
wear
very
plainly
brush
from
her
forehead
;
her
lip
be
thin
,
and
her
mouth
,
perhaps
,
in
general
inexpressive
,
but
when
she
be
eager
in
conversation
it
would
show
itself
to
be
animate
with
curve
of
wondrous
energy
;
and
,
quiet
as
she
be
in
manner
,
sober
and
demure
as
be
her
usual
settled
appearance
,
she
could
talk
,
when
the
fit
come
on
her
,
with
an
energy
which
in
truth
surprise
those
who
do
not
know
her
;
aye
,
and
sometimes
those
who
do
.
<EOS>
energy
!
<EOS>
nay
,
it
be
occasionally
a
concentration
of
passion
,
which
leave
her
for
the
moment
perfectly
unconscious
of
all
other
care
but
solicitude
for
that
subject
which
she
may
then
be
advocate
.
  
<EOS>
all
her
friend
,
include
the
doctor
,
have
at
time
be
make
unhappy
by
this
vehemence
of
character
;
but
yet
it
be
to
that
very
vehemence
that
she
owe
it
that
all
her
friend
so
love
her
.
<EOS>
It
have
once
nearly
banish
her
in
early
year
from
the
Greshamsbury
schoolroom
;
and
yet
it
end
in
make
her
claim
to
remain
there
so
strong
,
that
Lady
Arabella
could
no
longer
oppose
it
,
even
when
she
have
the
wish
to
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
a
new
french
governess
have
lately
come
to
Greshamsbury
,
and
be
,
or
be
to
be
,
a
great
pet
with
Lady
Arabella
,
have
all
the
great
gift
with
which
a
governess
can
be
endow
,
and
be
also
a
protégée
from
the
castle
.
<EOS>
the
castle
,
in
Greshamsbury
parlance
,
always
mean
that
of
Courcy
.
<EOS>
soon
after
this
a
value
little
locket
belong
to
Augusta
Gresham
be
miss
.
<EOS>
the
french
governess
have
object
to
its
be
wear
in
the
schoolroom
,
and
it
have
be
send
up
to
the
bedroom
by
a
young
servant
-
girl
,
the
daughter
of
a
small
farmer
on
the
estate
.
<EOS>
the
locket
be
miss
,
and
after
a
while
,
a
considerable
noise
in
the
matter
have
be
make
,
be
find
,
by
the
diligence
of
the
governess
,
somewhere
among
the
belonging
of
the
english
servant
.
<EOS>
Great
be
the
anger
of
Lady
Arabella
,
loud
be
the
protestation
of
the
girl
,
mute
the
woe
of
her
father
,
piteous
the
tear
of
her
mother
,
inexorable
the
judgment
of
the
Greshamsbury
world
.
<EOS>
but
something
occur
,
it
matter
now
not
<EOS>
what
,
to
separate
Mary
Thorne
in
opinion
from
that
world
at
large
.
<EOS>
out
she
then
speak
,
and
to
her
face
accuse
the
governess
of
the
robbery
.
<EOS>
for
two
day
Mary
be
in
disgrace
almost
as
deep
as
that
of
the
farmer
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
neither
quiet
nor
dumb
in
her
disgrace
.
<EOS>
when
Lady
Arabella
would
not
hear
her
,
she
go
to
Mr
Gresham
.
<EOS>
She
force
her
uncle
to
move
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
She
gain
over
to
her
side
,
one
by
one
,
the
potentate
of
the
parish
,
and
end
by
bring
Mam'selle
Larron
down
on
her
knee
with
a
confession
of
the
fact
.
<EOS>
from
that
time
Mary
Thorne
be
dear
to
the
tenantry
of
Greshamsbury
;
and
specially
dear
at
one
small
household
,
where
a
rough
-
spoken
father
of
a
family
be
often
hear
to
declare
,
that
for
Miss
Mary
Thorne
he
would
face
man
or
magistrate
,
duke
or
devil
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
Mary
Thorne
grow
up
under
the
doctor
's
eye
,
and
at
the
beginning
of
our
tale
she
be
one
of
the
guest
assemble
at
Greshamsbury
on
the
coming
of
age
of
the
heir
<EOS>
,
she
herself
have
then
arrive
at
the
same
period
of
her
life
.
   
<EOS>
lesson
from
Courcy
Castle
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
of
July
,
young
Frank
Gresham
's
birthday
,
and
the
London
season
be
not
yet
over
;
nevertheless
,
Lady
de
Courcy
have
manage
to
get
down
into
the
country
to
grace
the
coming
of
age
of
the
heir
,
bring
with
her
all
the
Ladies
Amelia
,
Rosina
,
Margaretta
,
and
Alexandrina
,
together
with
such
of
the
honourable
Johns
and
Georges
as
could
be
collect
for
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
the
Lady
Arabella
have
contrive
this
year
to
spend
ten
week
in
town
,
which
,
by
a
little
stretching
,
she
make
to
pass
for
the
season
;
and
have
manage
,
moreover
,
at
last
to
refurnish
,
not
ingloriously
,
the
Portman
Square
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
She
have
go
up
to
London
under
the
pretext
,
imperatively
urge
,
of
Augusta
's
tooth
 
<EOS>
young
lady
"
tooth
be
not
unfrequently
of
value
in
this
way
;
 
and
have
receive
authority
for
a
new
carpet
,
which
be
really
much
want
,
have
make
such
dexterous
use
of
that
sanction
as
to
run
up
an
upholsterer
's
bill
of
six
or
seven
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
She
have
of
course
have
her
carriage
and
horse
;
the
girl
of
course
have
go
out
;
it
have
be
positively
necessary
to
have
a
few
friend
in
Portman
Square
;
and
,
altogether
,
the
ten
week
have
not
be
unpleasant
,
and
not
inexpensive
.
  
<EOS>
for
a
few
confidential
minute
before
dinner
,
Lady
de
Courcy
and
her
sister
-
in
-
law
sit
together
in
the
latter
's
dressing
-
room
,
discuss
the
unreasonableness
of
the
squire
,
who
have
express
himself
with
more
than
ordinary
bitterness
as
to
the
folly
 
he
have
probably
use
some
strong
word
 
of
these
London
proceeding
.
  
<EOS>
"
Heavens
!
"
say
the
countess
,
with
much
eager
animation
;
"
what
can
the
man
expect
?
<EOS>
what
do
he
wish
you
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
would
like
to
sell
the
house
in
London
,
and
bury
us
all
here
for
ever
.
<EOS>
mind
,
I
be
there
only
for
ten
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
barely
time
for
the
girl
to
get
their
tooth
properly
look
at
!
<EOS>
but
Arabella
,
what
do
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
Lady
de
Courcy
be
very
anxious
to
learn
the
exact
truth
of
the
matter
,
and
ascertain
,
if
she
could
,
whether
Mr
Gresham
be
really
as
poor
as
he
pretend
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
he
say
yesterday
that
he
would
have
no
more
go
to
town
at
all
;
that
he
be
barely
able
to
pay
the
claim
make
on
him
,
and
keep
up
the
house
here
,
and
that
he
would
not
 
"
  
"
Would
not
what
?
"
<EOS>
ask
the
countess
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
he
say
that
he
would
not
utterly
ruin
poor
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ruin
Frank
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
what
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
,
surely
,
Arabella
,
it
be
not
so
bad
as
that
?
<EOS>
what
possible
reason
can
there
be
for
him
to
be
in
debt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
always
talk
of
those
election
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
my
dear
,
Boxall
Hill
pay
all
that
off
.
<EOS>
of
course
Frank
will
not
have
such
an
income
as
there
be
when
you
marry
into
the
family
;
we
all
know
that
.
<EOS>
and
whom
will
he
have
to
thank
but
his
father
?
<EOS>
but
Boxall
Hill
pay
all
those
debt
,
and
why
should
there
be
any
difficulty
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
those
nasty
dog
,
Rosina
,
"
say
the
Lady
Arabella
,
almost
in
tear
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
for
one
never
approve
of
the
hound
come
to
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
when
a
man
have
once
involve
his
property
he
should
not
incur
any
expense
that
be
not
absolutely
necessary
.
<EOS>
that
be
a
golden
rule
which
Mr
Gresham
ought
to
have
remember
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
put
it
to
him
nearly
in
those
very
word
;
but
Mr
Gresham
never
do
,
and
never
will
receive
with
common
civility
anything
that
come
from

death

stroke

luck

Frank
be
too
much
disgust

it
over

indifference

be
he
thus
to

watch
his

closely
enough

be
aware

he
know
how

delight
in
him

he
have
have
cause
to
guess

many
trouble

strove
hard

banish

quietly

It
be
so
difficult

enumerate
sententiously
a
principle

morality

than
your

five
time
six
be
thirty

thirty

to
himself

not

he

still
he
be
accessible
to
a
certain
amount
of
gratification
in
the
near
connexion
which
he
have
with
the
earl
and
countess
;
and
when
he
want
to
support
his
family
greatness
,
would
sometimes
weakly
fall
back
upon
the
grandeur
of
Courcy
Castle
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
when
talk
to
his
wife
that
he
invariably
snub
the
pretension
of
his
noble
relative
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
man
after
this
remain
silent
for
a
while
;
and
then
the
doctor
,
renew
the
subject
for
which
he
have
be
summon
into
the
book

room
,
remark
,
that
as
Scatcherd
be
now
in

he
do
not

be
now
at
Boxall
Hill

as
he
do
not
wish
to
wound
the
squire
's
ear
 
<EOS>
perhaps
he
have
better
go
and
see
him
,
and
ascertain
in
what
way
this
affair
of
the
money
may
be
arrange
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
,
he
say
,
that
Scatcherd
would
supply
the
sum
require
at
a
low
rate
of
interest
than
that
at
which
it
could
be
procure
through
Umbleby
's
mean

<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
say
the
squire

<EOS>
"
I
will
leave
it
in
your
hand

then

I
think
ten
thousand
pound
will
do

and
now
I
will
dress
for
dinner

<EOS>
and
then
the
doctor
leave
him
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
the
reader
will
suppose
after
this
that
the
doctor
have
some
pecuniary
interest
of
his
own
in
arrange
the
squire
's
loan
;
or
,
at
any
rate
,
he
will
think
that
the
squire
must
have
so
think
.
<EOS>
not
in
the
least
;
neither
have
he
any
such
interest
,
nor
do
the
squire
think
that
he
have
any
.
<EOS>
what
Dr
Thorne
do
in
this
matter
the
squire
well
know
be
do
for
love

the
squire
of
Greshamsbury
be
a
great
man
at
Greshamsbury

it
behove
him
to
maintain
the
greatness
of
his
squirehood
when
discuss
his

village
doctor

<EOS>
so
much
he
have
at
any
rate
learn
from
his
contact
with
the
de

<EOS>
and
the
doctor
 
proud
,
arrogant
,
contradictory
,
headstrong
<EOS>
as
he
be
 
why
do
he
bear
to
be
thus
snub
?
<EOS>
because
he
know
that
the
squire
of
Greshamsbury
,
when
struggle
with
debt
and
poverty
,
require
an
indulgence
for
his
weakness

<EOS>
have
Mr
Gresham
be
in
easy
circumstance
,
the
doctor
would
by
no
means
have
stand
so
placidly
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
and
have
have
Mr
Umbleby
thus
throw
in
his
tooth

<EOS>
the
doctor
love
the
squire

love
him
as
his

he
love
him
ten
time
better
as

do
have
thing
go
well

expedient

He

that
Mr

Augusta

not
go
so
far
as

a

the
rigid
truth
in

<EOS>
he
be
not
a

in

affair
at
Greshamsbury

she
understand
well
that
it
be
her
duty
to
postpone
her
own

respect

<EOS>
Mr
Moffat
would
bring
fortune

she
would
bring
blood

connexion

and
as
she
so
say

her
bosom
glow
with
strong
pride
to
think
that
she
would
be
able
to
contribute
so
much
more
towards
the
propose
future
partnership
than
her
husband
would
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
Twas
thus
that
Miss

her
match

She

judgment

Mr

offer

any
romance
of
affection

<EOS>
and
,
have
so
say
,
she
go
to
work
with
considerable
mental
satisfaction
,
choose
furniture
,
carriage
,
and
clothe
,
not
extravagantly
as
her
mother
would
have
do
,
not
in
deference
to
sterner
dictate
of
the
late
fashion
as
her
aunt
would
have
do
,
with
none
of
the
girlish
glee
in
new
purchase
which
Beatrice
would
have
feel
,
but
with
sound
judgment
.
<EOS>
She
buy
thing
that
be
rich
,
for
her
husband
<EOS>
be
to
be
rich
,
and
she
mean
to
avail
herself
of
his
wealth
;
she
buy
thing
that
be
fashionable
,
for
she
mean
to
live
in
the
fashionable
world
;
but
she
buy
what
be
good
,
and
strong
,
and
last
,
and
worth
its
money

<EOS>
Augusta
Gresham
have
perceive
early
in
life
that
she
could
not
obtain
success
either
as
an
heiress
,
or
as
a
beauty
,
nor
could
she
shine
as
a
wit
;
she
therefore
fall
back
on
such
quality
as
she
have
,
and
determine
to
win
the
world
as
a
strong
-
minded
,
useful
woman
.
<EOS>
that
which
she
have
of
her
own

have
that

she
would
in
all
way
do
what
in
her
lay
to
enhance
its
value

have
she
not
possess
it

it
would
to

the
vain
of

<EOS>
sensible
as
Augusta

she

not

such
feminine
care

she

rather
anxious
that
the
wedding
should
go
off
well
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
little
ashamed
of
her
tailor
's
son
,
and
therefore
anxious
that
thing
should
be
as
brilliant
as
possible

<EOS>
the

after

if
there

more
there
must

now
Miss

have
express
a
direct
wish

and
Augusta
,
though
she
would
much
rather
have
do
without

hardly

how
to
refuse

<EOS>
Alexandrina
 
we
hope
we
may

allow
to
drop

<EOS>
"
We

"
<EOS>
Beatrice
strongly
advocate
the
future
sister

in

law
's
acceptance
into
the
bevy
;
she
have
her
own
reason
;
she
be
pain
that
Mary
Thorne
should
not
be
among
the
number
,
and
if
Miss
Moffat
be
accept
,
perhaps
Mary
may
be
bring
in
as
her
colleague
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you

Miss

"
say
Alexandrina

"
you
must
have

<EOS>
Pussy
be
the
young

"
if
you
do
have
Miss
Moffat
would
you
mind
ask
Mary
Thorne
to
join
her
?
<EOS>
I
think
Mary
would
like
it
,
because
,
you
see
,
Patience
Oriel
be
to
be
one
;

we
have
know
Mary
much
longer

we

after

Mamma

<EOS>
but
Augusta

very
peculiarly
situate

<EOS>
Mr

be
,
you
see
,
not
of

very
high
birth

she
should
take
care

on

side

well

"
no

I
would
not

I
could

I

Miss

very
free

<EOS>
the

Courcy
lady
know
what

no

therefore

the
Lady

up

go
to

bedroom

slowly
from

much
stately
composure

it
be
nearly
time
to
dress

will
you
come
with
me
?
<EOS>
We
have
a
great
deal
to
settle
,
you
know

"
  
<EOS>
so
she
swam
out
of
the

Augusta

tell
Mary
that
she
would
see
her
again
at
dinner

swam
 
no

try
to

after

Miss
Gresham

have
great
advantage

she
have
not
be
absolutely
bring
up
at
Courcy
Castle

could
not
as
yet
quite
assume
the
Courcy
style
of
swimming
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
,
"
say
Mary
,
as
the
door
close
behind
the
rustle
muslin
of
the
lady

<EOS>
"
there

I
have
make
an
enemy
for
ever

perhaps
two

that
be
satisfactory

and
why
have
you
do
it
,
Mary

<EOS>
when
I
be

your
battle
behind

why
do
you
come

upset
it
all
by
make
the

you

all
go
together

<EOS>

I
be
sure
they

whether

why

you

my

you

do
not
you

humble

umble

superlative

four

umble

tumble

that

no

I

I
,
too

suffer
from
pride

a
pride
quite
as
unpardonable
as
that
of
other

I
could
not
stand
with
your
four
lady

cousin
behind
your

altar

in
such
a
galaxy
they

the
star

I

all

I

I
should
not
object
if
I
be
as
ugly
as
the
veiled

beautiful

Zuleika

<EOS>
the
glory
of
that
galaxy
will
be
hold
to
depend
not

on
its
birth

<EOS>
You
know
how

look

there

at

with
all

I

the

<EOS>
Frank
Gresham
's
first
speech
 
<EOS>
We
have
say
,
that
over
and
above
those
assemble
in
the
house
,
there
come
to
the
Greshamsbury
dinner
on
Frank
's
birthday
the
Jacksons
of
the
Grange
,
consist
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Jackson
;
the
bateson
from
Annesgrove
,
viz
.
,
Mr
and
Mrs
Bateson
,
and
Miss
Bateson
,
their
daughter
 
an
unmarried
lady
of
about
fifty
;
the
Bakers
of
Mill
Hill

father
and
son
;
and
Mr
Caleb
Oriel
,
the
rector
,
with
his
beautiful
sister
,
Patience
.
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
,
and
his
niece
Mary
,
we
count
among
those
already
assemble
at
Greshamsbury
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
very
magnificent
in
the
number
of
the
guest
thus
bring
together
to
do
honour
to
young
Frank
;
but
he
,
perhaps
,
be
call
on
to
take
a
more
prominent
part
in
the
proceeding
,
to
be
make
more
of
a
hero
than
would
have
be
the
case
have
half
the
county
be
there
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
the
importance
of
the
guest
would
have
be
so
great
that
Frank
would
have
get
off
with
a
half
-
muttered
speech
or
two
;
but
now
he
have
to
make
a
separate
oration
to
every
one
,
and
very
weary
work
he
find
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
Batesons
,
Bakers
,
and
Jacksons
be
very
civil
;
no
doubt
the
more
so
from
an
unconscious
feeling
on
their
part
,
that
as
the
squire
be
know
to
be
a
little
out
at
elbow
as
regard
money
,
any
deficiency
on
their
part
may
be
consider
as
owe
to
the
present
state
of
affair
at
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
fourteen
thousand
a
year
will
receive
honour
;
in
that
case
there
be
no
doubt
,
and
the
man
absolutely
possess
it
be
not
apt
to
be
suspicious
as
to
the
treatment
he
may
receive
;
but
the
ghost
of
fourteen
thousand
a
year
be
not
always
so
self
-
assure
.
<EOS>
Mr
Baker
,
with
his
moderate
income
,
be
a
very
much
rich
man
than
the
squire
;
and
,
therefore
,
he
be
peculiarly
forward
in
congratulate
Frank
on
the
brilliancy
of
his
prospect
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Frank
have
hardly
anticipate
what
there
would
be
to
do
,
and
before
dinner
be
announce
he
be
very
tired
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
warm
feeling
for
any
of
the
grand
cousin
than
a
very
ordinary
cousinly
love
;
and
he
have
resolve
,
forgetful
of
birth
and
blood
,
and
all
those
gigantic
consideration
which
,
now
that
manhood
have
come
upon
him
,
he
be
bind
always
to
bear
in
mind
,
 
he
have
resolve
to
sneak
out
to
dinner
comfortably
with
Mary
Thorne
if
possible
;
and
if
not
with
Mary
,
then
with
his
other
love
,
Patience
Oriel
.
  
<EOS>
great
,
therefore
,
be
his
consternation
at
find
that
,
after
be
keep
continually
in
the
foreground
for
half
an
hour
before
dinner
,
he
have
to
walk
out
to
the
dining
-
room
with
his
aunt
the
countess
,
and
take
his
father
's
place
for
the
day
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
now
depend
altogether
upon
yourself
,
Frank
,
whether
you
maintain
or
lose
that
high
position
in
the
county
which
have
be
hold
by
the
Greshams
for
so
many
year
,
"
say
the
countess
,
as
she
walk
through
the
spacious
hall
,
resolve
to
lose
no
time
in
teaching
to
her
nephew
that
great
lesson
which
it
be
so
imperative
that
he
should
learn
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
take
this
as
an
ordinary
lecture
,
mean
to
inculcate
general
good
conduct
,
such
as
old
bore
of
aunt
be
apt
to
inflict
on
youthful
victim
in
the
shape
of
nephew
and
niece
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Frank
;
"
I
suppose
so
;
and
I
mean
to
go
along
all
square
,
aunt
,
and
no
mistake
.
<EOS>
when
I
get
back
to
Cambridge
,
I
will
read
like
brick
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
aunt
do
not
care
two
straw
about
his
reading
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
by
read
that
the
Greshams
of
Greshamsbury
have
hold
their
head
up
in
the
county
,
but
by
have
high
blood
and
plenty
of
money
.
<EOS>
the
blood
have
come
naturally
to
this
young
man
;
but
it
behove
him
to
look
for
the
money
in
a
great
measure
himself
.
<EOS>
She
,
Lady
de
Courcy
,
could
doubtless
help
him
;
she
may
probably
be
able
to
fit
him
with
a
wife
who
would
bring
her
money
onto
his
birth
.
<EOS>
His
reading
be
a
matter
in
which
she
could
in
no
way
assist
him
;
whether
his
taste
may
lead
him
to
prefer
book
or
picture
,
or
dog
and
horse
,
or
turnip
in
drill
,
or
old
italian
plate
and
dish
,
be
a
matter
which
do
not
much
signify
;
with
which
it
be
not
at
all
necessary
that
his
noble
aunt
should
trouble
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
you
be
go
to
Cambridge
again

I

perhaps
you
would
speak
to
Mr

<EOS>
the
countess
smile
grimly
,

shake
her

negative
shake

she

out
loud
to
the
young
man

such
an

it
would
be
waste
fragrance
on
the
desert
air

"
she
could
not
have
speak
more
plainly
.
<EOS>
the
effect
on
Frank
be
this
:
that
he
say
to
himself
,
speak
quite
as
plainly
as
Lady
de
Courcy
have
speak
by
her
shake
of
the
face
,
"
My
mother

aunt
be
always
down
on
the
governor

always
;

the
more
they
be
down
on
him
the
more
I
will
stick
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
certainly
will
take
my
degree
:
I
will
read
like
brick
;

I
will
begin
to

<EOS>
"
now
will
you
take
some
beef
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
this
be
say
out
loud
.
  
<EOS>
the
Countess
de
Courcy
be
very
anxious
to
go
on
with
her
lesson
without
loss
of
time
;
but
she
could
not
,
while
surround
by
guest
and
servant
,
enunciate
the
great
secret
:
"
You
must
marry
money
,
Frank
;
that
be
your
one
great
duty
;
that
be
the
matter
to
be
bear
steadfastly
in
your
mind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
could
not
now
,
with
sufficient
weight
and
impress
of
emphasis
,
pour
this
wisdom
into
his
ear
;
the
more
especially
as
he
be
stand
up
to
his
work
of
carving
,
and
be
deep
to
his
elbow
in
horse
-
radish
,
fat
,
and
gravy

<EOS>
so
the
countess
sit
silent
while
the
banquet
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Beef
,
Harry

shout
the
young
heir
to
his
friend
Baker

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
but
I
see
it
be
not
your
turn

I
beg
your
pardon

Miss
Bateson

he
send
to
that
lady
a
pound

a
half
of
excellent
meat
,
cut
out
with
great
energy
in
one
slice

about
half
an
inch
thick

and
so
the
banquet
go
on

<EOS>
before
dinner
Frank
have
find
himself
oblige
to
make
numerous
small
speech
in
answer
to
the
numerous
individual
congratulation
of
his
friend
;
but
these
be
as
nothing
to
the
one
great
accumulate
onus
of
an
oration
which
he
have
long
know
that
he
should
have
to
sustain
after
the
cloth
be
take
away
.
<EOS>
someone
of
course
would
propose
his
health
,
and
then
there
would
be
a
clatter
of
voice
,
lady
and
gentleman
,
man
and
girl
;
and
when
that
be
do
he
would
find
himself
stand
on
his
leg
,
with
the
room
about
him
,
go
round
and
round
and
round
.
  
<EOS>
have
have
a
previous
hint
of
this
,
he
have
seek
advice
from
his
cousin
,
the
honourable
George
,
whom
he
regard
as
a
dab
at
speak
;
at
least
,
so
he
have
hear
the
honourable
George
say
of
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
the
deuce
be
a
fellow
to
say
,
George

when
he
stand
up
after
the
clatter

do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh

it
be
the
easy
thing
in
life

say
the
cousin

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
only
remember
this
:
you
must
not
get
astray
;
that
be
what
they
call
presence
of
mind
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
what
I
do
,
and
I
be
often
call
up
,
you
know

at
our
agricultural
I
always
propose
the
farmer

daughter

<EOS>
well
,
what
I
do
be
this
 
<EOS>
I
keep
my
eye
steadfastly

and
never
move
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
on
one
of
the
bottle

"
say
Frank

"
would
not
it
be
well
if
I
make
a
mark
of
some
old
covey

head

<EOS>
I
do
not
like
look
at
the
table

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
old
covey'd
move
,
and
then
you
would
be
do
;
besides
there
be
not
the
least
use
in
the
world
in
look
up
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
people
say
,
who
go
to
those
sort
of
dinner
every
day
of
their
life

<EOS>
that
whenever
anything
witty

the

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh

you
know
I
shall
not

anything
witty

I
will
be
quite
the
other
way

<EOS>
"
but
there
be
no
reason
you
should
not
learn
the
manner

that
be
the
way
I
succeed

fix
your
eye
on
one
of
the
bottle

put
your
thumb
in
your
waist

coat
pocket
;
stick
out
your
elbow

bend
your
knee
a
little
,

then
go
ahead

<EOS>
"
oh

ah

go
ahead

all
very
well

you
can

ahead
if
you
have
not
get
any
steam

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
very
little
do
it
.
<EOS>
there
can
be
nothing
so
easy
as
your
speech
.
<EOS>
when
one
have
to
say
something
new
every
year
about
the
farmer
'
daughter
,
why
one
have
to
use
one
's
brain
a
bit
.
<EOS>
let
's
see
:
how
will
you
begin
?
<EOS>
of
course
,
you
will
say
that
you
be
not
accustomed
to
this
sort
of
thing
;
that
the
honour
confer
upon
you
be
too
much
for
your
feeling
;
that
the
bright
array
of
beauty
and
talent
around
you
quite
overpower
your
tongue
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
then
declare
you
be
a
Gresham
to
the
backbone

<EOS>
"
oh
,
they
know
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
tell
them
again
.
<EOS>
then
of
course
you
must
say
something
about
us
;
or
you
will
have
the
countess
as
black
as
old
Nick
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
abut
my
aunt
,
George
?
<EOS>
what
on
earth
can
I
say
about
her
when
she
be
there
herself
before
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
before
you
!
<EOS>
of
course
;
that
be
just
the
reason
.
<EOS>
oh
,
say
any
lie
you
can
think
of
;
you
must
say
something

Frank
,
in

erudition

could
not

wish
in
his
heart
that
they
have
all

this
he
keep
to
himself

He
thank
his

for
his

do
not
feel

the
trouble

completely

he
begin
to
hope
that
he
may
go
through
the
ordeal
without
disgrace
himself

<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
feel
rather
sick
at
heart
when
Mr

get
up

well

They
have
all

and
be
now
require
to
welcome
as
a

His

<EOS>
Mr

omit
to
make
mention
of
the
infusion
of

and
the
countess
,
therefore
,
draw
herself
up
on
her
chair
and
look
as
though
she
be
extremely
bored

<EOS>
He
then
allude
tenderly
to
his

long
friendship
with
the

there

such

he
essay

rise
up
on
his
foot
for
the
first
time

have
come
to
man

estate

<EOS>
when
the
clatter
be
at
an
end
,
and
he
be
fairly
on
his
leg
,
he
cast
a
glance
before
him
on
the
table
,
to
look
for
a
decanter
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
much
like
his
cousin

theory
of
stick
to
the
bottle
;
nevertheless
,
in
the
difficulty
of
the
moment
,
it
be
well
to
have
any
system
to
go
by
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
misfortune
would
have
it
,
though
the
table
be
cover
with
bottle
,
his
eye
could
not
catch
one
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
his
eye
first
could
catch
nothing
,
for
the
thing
swam
before
him
,
and
the
guest
all
seem
to
dance
in
their
chair
.
  
<EOS>
up
<EOS>
he
get
,
however
,
and
commence
his
speech
.
<EOS>
as
he
could
not
follow
his
preceptor
's
advice
as
touch
the
bottle
,
he
adopt
his
own
crude
plan
of
"
make
a
mark
on
some
old
covey
's
head
,
"
and
therefore
look
dead
at
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
I
be
very
much
oblige
to
you

well

I
hope
I

"
<EOS>
here
the
countess

to
look
cold
and
angry

"
I
hope
the
day
will
never
come
when
my

not
own
me
for

<EOS>
"
there
be
no
fear

no
fear

say
the
doctor

who
be
almost
put
out
of
countenance
by
the
orator
's
intense
gaze

<EOS>
the
countess
look
cold
and
more
angry

mutter
something
to
herself
about
a
bear

garden

"
Gardez
Gresham
;
eh
?
<EOS>
Harry
!
<EOS>
mind
that
when
you
be
stick
in
a
gap
<EOS>
and
I
be
come
after
you
.
<EOS>
well
,
I
be
sure
I
be
very
obliged
to
you
for
the
honour
you
have
all
do
me
,
especially
the
lady
,
who
do
not
do
this
sort
of
thing
on
ordinary
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
wish
they
do
;
do
not
you
,
doctor
?
<EOS>
and
talk
of
the
lady
,
my
aunt
and
cousin
have
come
all
the
way
from
London
to
hear
me
make
this
speech
,
which
certainly
be
not
worth
the
trouble
;
but
,
all
the
same
I
be
very
much
oblige
to
them
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
look
round
and
make
a
little
bow
at
the
countess
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
I
be
to
Mr
and
Mrs
Jackson
,
and
Mr
and
Mrs
and
Miss
Bateson
,
and
Mr
Baker
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
at
all
oblige
to
you
,
Harry
 
and
to
Mr
Oriel
and
Miss
Oriel
,
and
to
Mr
Umbleby
,
and
to
Dr
Thorne
,
and
to
Mary
 
<EOS>
I
beg
her
pardon
,
I
mean
Miss
Thorne
.
<EOS>
"
and
then
he
sit
down
,
amid
the
loud
plaudit
of
the
company
,
and
a
string
of
blessing
which
come
from
the
servant
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
the
lady
rise
and
depart
.
<EOS>
as
she
go
,
Lady
Arabella
,
kiss
her
son
's
forehead
,
and
then
his
sister
kiss
him
,
and
one
or
two
of
his
lady
-
cousin
;
and
then
Miss
Bateson
shake
him
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Miss
Bateson
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
think
the
kissing
be
to
go
all
round
.
"
<EOS>
so
Miss
Bateson
laugh
and
go
her
way
;
and
Patience
Oriel
nod
at
him
,
but
<EOS>
Mary
Thorne
,
as
she
quietly
leave
the
room
,
almost
hide
among
the
extensive
drapery
of
the
grander
lady
,
hardly
allow
her
eye
to
meet
his
.
  
<EOS>
He
get
up
to
hold
the
door
for
them
as
they
pass
;
and
as
they
go
,
he
manage
to
take
Patience
by
the
hand
;
he
take
her
hand
and
press
it
for
a
moment
,
but
drop
it
quickly
,
in
order
that
he
may
go
through
the
same
ceremony
with
Mary
,
but
Mary
be
too
quick
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Frank
,
"
say
Mr
Gresham
,
as
soon
as
the
door
be
close
,
"
bring
your
glass
here
,
my
boy
;
"
and
the
father
make
room
for
his
son
close
beside
himself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
ceremony
be
now
over
,
so
you
may
have
your
place
of
dignity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Frank
sit
himself
down
where
he
be
tell
,
and
Mr
Gresham
put
his
hand
on
his
son
's
shoulder
and
half
caress
him
,
while
the
tear
stand
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
the
doctor
be
right
,
Baker
,
I
think
he
will
never
make
us
ashamed
of
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
he
never
will
,
"
say
Mr
Baker
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
he
ever
will
,
"
say
Dr
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
the
tone
of
the
man
's
voice
be
very
different
.
<EOS>
Mr
Baker
do
not
care
a
straw
about
it
;
why
should
he
?
<EOS>
He
have
an
heir
of
his
own
as
well
as
the
squire
;
one
also
who
be
the
apple
of
_
his
_
eye
.
<EOS>
but
the
doctor
,
 
he
do
care
;
he
have
a
niece
,
to
be
sure
,
whom
he
love
,
perhaps
as
well
as
these
man
love
their
son
;
but
there
be
room
in
his
heart
also
for
young
Frank
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
small
exposé
of
feeling
they
sit
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
.
<EOS>
but
silence
be
not
dear
to
the
heart
of
the
Honourable
John
,
and
so
he
take
up
the
running
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
niceish
nag
you
give
Frank
this
morning
,
"
he
say
to
his
uncle
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
look
at
him
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
Monsoon
,
be
not
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
I
can
not
say
I
know
how
he
be
breed
,
"
say
the
squire
.
"
<EOS>
He
show
a
good
deal
of
breeding
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
Monsoon
,
I
be
sure
,
"
say
the
honourable
John
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
all
those
ear
,
and
that
peculiar
dip
in
the
back
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
give
a
goodish
figure
for
him
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
so
very
much
,
"
say
the
squire
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
train
hunter
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
if
not
,
he
soon
will
be
,
"
say
the
squire
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
Frank
alone
for
that
,
"
say
Harry
Baker
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
jump
beautifully
,
sir
,
"
say
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
try
him
myself
,
but
Peter
make
him
go
over
the
bar
two
or
three
time
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
honourable
John
be
determined
to
give
his
cousin
a
help
hand
,
as
he
consider
it
.
<EOS>
He
think
that
Frank
be
very
ill
-
use
in
be
put
off
with
so
incomplete
a
stud
,
and
think
also
that
the
son
have
not
spirit
enough
to
attack
his
father
himself
on
the
subject
,
the
honourable
John
determine
to
do
it
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
the
making
of
a
very
nice
horse
,
I
do
not
doubt
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
have
a
string
like
him
,
Frank
.
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
feel
the
blood
rush
to
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
for
world
have
his
father
think
that
he
be
discontent
,
or
otherwise
than
pleased
with
the
present
he
have
receive
that
morning
.
<EOS>
He
be
heartily
ashamed
of
himself
in
that
he
have
listen
with
a
certain
degree
of
complacency
to
his
cousin
's
tempting
;
but
he
have
no
idea
that
the
subject
would
be
repeat
 
and
then
repeat
,
too
,
before
his
father
,
in
a
manner
to
vex
him
on
such
a
day
as
this
,
before
such
people
as
be
assemble
there
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
angry
with
his
cousin
,
and
for
a
moment
forget
all
his
hereditary
respect
for
a
de
Courcy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
,
John
,
"
say
he
,
"
do
you
choose
your
day
,
some
day
early
in
the
season
,
and
come
out
on
the
good
thing
you
have
,
and
I
will
bring
,
not
the
black
horse
,
but
my
old
mare
;
and
then
do
you
try
and
keep
near
me
.
<EOS>
if
I
do
not
leave
you
at
the
back
of
Godspeed
before
long
,
I
will
give
you
the
mare
and
the
horse
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
honourable
John
be
not
know
in
Barsetshire
as
one
of
the
most
forward
of
its
rider
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
much
addict
to
hunting
,
as
far
as
the
get
-
up
of
the
thing
be
concern
;
he
be
great
in
boot
and
breech
;
wondrously
conversant
with
bit
and
bridle
;
he
have
quite
a
collection
of
saddle
;
and
patronise
every
new
invention
for
carry
spare
shoe
,
sandwich
,
and
flask
of
sherry
.
<EOS>
He
be
prominent
at
the
cover
side
;
 
some
people
,
include
the
master
of
hound
,
think
him
perhaps
a
little
too
loudly
prominent
;
he
affect
a
familiarity
with
the
dog
,
and
be
on
speak
acquaintance
with
every
man
's
horse
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
work
be
cut
out
,
when
the
pace
begin
to
be
sharp
,
when
it
behove
a
man
either
to
ride
or
visibly
to
decline
to
ride
,
then
 
so
at
least
say
they
who
have
not
the
de
Courcy
interest
quite
closely
at
heart
 
then
,
in
those
heart
-
stir
moment
,
the
honourable
John
be
too
often
find
deficient
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
,
therefore
,
a
considerable
laugh
at
his
expense
when
Frank
,
instigate
to
his
innocent
boast
by
a
desire
to
save
his
father
,
challenge
his
cousin
to
a
trial
of
prowess
.
<EOS>
the
honourable
John
be
not
,
perhaps
,
as
much
accustom
to
the
ready
use
of
his
tongue
as
be
his
honourable
brother
,
see
that
it
be
not
his
annual
business
to
depict
the
glory
of
the
farmer
"
daughter
;
at
any
rate
,
on
this
occasion
he
seem
to
be
at
some
loss
for
word
;
he
shut
up
,
as
the
slang
phrase
go
,
and
make
no
further
allusion
to
the
necessity
of
supply
young
Gresham
with
a
proper
string
of
hunter
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
old
squire
have
understand
it
all
;
have
understand
the
meaning
of
his
nephew
's
attack
;
have
thoroughly
understand
also
the
meaning
of
his
son
's
defence
,
and
the
feeling
which
actuate
it
.
<EOS>
He
also
have
think
of
the
stableful
of
horse
which
have
belong
to
himself
when
he
come
of
age
;
and
of
the
much
more
humble
position
which
his
son
would
have
to
fill
than
that
which
_
his
_
father
have
prepare
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
think
of
this
,
and
be
sad
enough
,
though
he
have
sufficient
spirit
to
hide
from
his
friend
around
him
the
fact
,
that
the
Honourable
John
's
arrow
have
not
be
discharge
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
shall
have
Champion
,
"
say
the
father
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
time
for
me
to
give
it
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
now
Champion
be
one
of
the
two
fine
old
hunter
which
the
squire
keep
for
his
own
use
.
<EOS>
and
it
may
have
be
say
of
him
now
,
at
the
period
of
which
we
be
speak
,
that
the
only
really
happy
moment
of
his
life
be
those
which
he
spend
in
the
field
.
<EOS>
so
much
as
to
its
be
time
for
him
to
give
up
.
   
<EOS>
Frank
Gresham
's
early
love
 
<EOS>
It
be
,
we
have
say
,
the
first
of
July
,
and
such
be
the
time
of
the
year
,
<EOS>
the
lady
,
after
sit
in
the
drawing
-
room
for
half
an
hour
or
so
,
begin
to
think
that
they
may
as
well
go
through
the
drawing
-
room
window
on
to
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
first
one
slip
out
a
little
way
,
and
then
another
;
and
then
they
get
on
to
the
lawn
;
and
then
they
talk
of
their
hat
;
till
,
by
degree
,
the
young
one
of
the
party
,
and
at
last
of
the
elder
also
,
find
themselves
dressed
for
walk
.
  
<EOS>
the
window
,
both
of
the
drawing
-
room
and
the
dining
-
room
,
look
out
on
to
the
lawn
;
and
it
be
only
natural
that
the
girl
should
walk
from
the
former
to
the
latter
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
natural
that
they
,
be
there
,
should
tempt
their
swain
to
come
to
them
by
the
sight
of
their
broad
-
brim
hat
and
evening
dress
;
and
natural
,
also
,
that
the
temptation
should
not
be
resist
.
<EOS>
the
squire
,
therefore
,
and
the
eld
male
guest
soon
find
themselves
alone
round
their
wine
.
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
we
be
enchant
by
your
eloquence
,
Mr
Gresham
,
be
we
not
?
"
say
Miss
Oriel
,
turn
to
one
of
the
de
Courcy
girl
who
be
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Oriel
be
a
very
pretty
girl
;
a
little
old
than
Frank
Gresham
,
 
perhaps
a
year
or
so
.
<EOS>
She
have
dark
hair
,
large
round
dark
eye
,
a
nose
a
little
too
broad
,
a
pretty
mouth
,
a
beautiful
chin
,
and
,
as
we
have
say
before
,
a
large
fortune
;
 
that
is
,
moderately
large
 
<EOS>
let
us
say
twenty
thousand
pound
,
there
or
thereabout
.
<EOS>
She
and
her
brother
have
be
live
at
Greshamsbury
for
the
last
two
year
,
the
living
have
be
purchase
for
him
 
<EOS>
such
be
Mr
Gresham
's
necessity
 
during
the
lifetime
of
the
last
old
incumbent

<EOS>
Miss
Oriel
be
in
every
respect
a
nice
neighbour
;
she
be
good
-
humoured
,
lady
-
like
,
lively
,
neither
too
clever
nor
too
stupid
,
belong
to
a
good
family
<EOS>
,
sufficiently
fond
of
this
world
's
good
thing
,
as
become
a
pretty
young
lady
so
endowed
,
and
sufficiently
fond
,
also
,
of
the
other
world
's
good
thing
,
as
become
the
mistress
of

house

<EOS>
"
indeed
,
yes
,
"
say
the
Lady
Margaretta
.
<EOS>
"
Frank
be
very
eloquent
.
<EOS>
when
he
describe
our
rapid
journey
from
London
,
he
nearly
move
me
to
tear
.
<EOS>
but
well
as
he
talk
,
I
think
he
carve
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
have
to
do
it

both
the
carving

talking

<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
Frank
;
you
be
very
civil

there
be
one
comfort

Miss

it
be
over
now
,

do
.
<EOS>
a
fellow
can
not
be
make
to
come
of
age
twice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
take
your
degree
,
Mr
Gresham
;
and
then
,
of
course
,
there
will
be
another
speech
;
and
then
you
will
get
married
,
and
there
will
be
two
or
three
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
speak
at
your
wedding
,
Miss
Oriel
,
long
before
I
do
at
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
have
the
slight
objection

<EOS>
It
will
be
so
kind
of
you
to
patronise
my
husband

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
by
Jove
,
will
he
patronise
me
?
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
marry
some
awful
bigwig

some
terribly
clever
fellow

<EOS>
will
not
she
,
Margaretta

"
  
"
Miss
Oriel
be

so
much
in

who

<EOS>
what
a
pity
it
be
that
my

You
calculate
on
that
,
I
know

you
would
never

me
so

"
  
<EOS>
She
say
so
just
as
her
brother
join
them
,
or
rather
just
as
he
have
join
Lady
Margaretta
de
Courcy
;
for
her
ladyship
and
Mr
Oriel
walk
on
in
advance
by
themselves
.
<EOS>
Lady
Margaretta
have
find
it
rather
dull
work
,
make
a
third
in
Miss
Oriel
's
flirtation
with
her
cousin
;
the
more
so
as
she
be
quite
accustomed
to
take
a
principal
part
herself
in
all
such
transaction
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
not
unwillingly
walk
on
with
Mr
Oriel
.
<EOS>
Mr
Oriel
,
it
must
be
conceive
,
be
not
a
common
,
everyday
parson
,
but
have
point
about
him
which
make
him
quite
fit
to
associate
with
an
earl
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
and
as
it
be
know
that
he
be
not
a
marry
man
,
have
very
exalted
idea
on
that
point
connect
with
his
profession
,
the
Lady
Margaretta
,
of
course
,
have
the
less
objection
to
trust
herself
alone
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
directly
she
be
go
,
Miss
Oriel
's
tone
of
banter
cease
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
well
make
a
fool
of
a
lad
of
twenty
-
one
when
other
be
by
;
but
there
may
be
danger
in
it
when
they
be
alone
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
any
position
on

more
enviable

yours

Mr

quite
soberly

earnestly
;

how
happy
you
ought

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
,
in

pretend

out
that
I
be
only
a
boy
?
<EOS>
I
can
bear
to
be
laugh
at
pretty
well
generally
,
but
I
can
not

that
your
laughing
at
me
make
me
feel
so
happy
as
you
say
I
ought
to
be

"
  
<EOS>
Frank
be
evidently
of
an
opinion
totally
different
from
that
of
Miss
Oriel
.
<EOS>
Miss
Oriel
,
when
she
find
herself
_
tête
-
à
-
tête
_
with
him
,
think
it
be
time
to
give
over
flirting
;
Frank
,
however
,
imagine
that
it
be
just
the
moment
for
him
to
begin
.
<EOS>
so
he
speak
and
look
very
languishing
,
and
put
on
him
quite
the
air
of
an
Orlando
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mr

such
good
friend

<EOS>
"
You
may
do
what
you
like

beautiful

always

you
remember
what
the
spider
say
to
the
fly
,
"
that
which
be
sport
to
you
,
may
be
death
to
me

"
<EOS>
"
anyone
look
at
Frank
's
face
as
he
say
this
,
may
well
have
imagine
that
he
be
break
his
very
heart
for
love
of
Miss
Oriel
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Master
Frank
!
<EOS>
Master
Frank
!
<EOS>
if
you
act
thus
in
the
green
leaf
,
what
will
you
do
in
the
dry
?
  
<EOS>
while
Frank
Gresham
be
thus
misbehave
himself
,
and
go
on
as
though
to
him
belong
the
privilege
of
fall
in
love
with
pretty
face
,
as
it
do
to
ploughboy
and
other
ordinary
people
,
his
great
interest
be
not
forget
by
those
guardian
saint
who
be
so
anxious
to
shower
down
on
his
head
all
manner
of
temporal
blessing
.
  
<EOS>
another
conversation
have
take
place
in
the
Greshamsbury
garden
,
in
which
nothing
light
have
be
allow
to
present
itself
;
nothing
frivolous
have
be
speak
.
<EOS>
the
countess
,
the
Lady
Arabella
,
and
Miss
Gresham
have
be
talk
over
Greshamsbury
affair
,
and
they
have
latterly
be
assist
by
the
Lady
Amelia
,
than
whom
no
de
Courcy
ever
bear
be
more
wise
,
more
solemn
,
more
prudent
,
or
more
proud
.
<EOS>
the
ponderosity
of
her
qualification
for
nobility
be
sometimes
too
much
even
for
her
mother
,
and
her
devotion
to
the
peerage
be
such
,
that
she
would
certainly
have
decline
a
seat
in
heaven
if
offer
to
her
without
the
promise
that
it
should
be
in
the
upper
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
subject
first
discuss
have
be
Augusta
's
prospect
.
<EOS>
Mr
Moffat
have
be
invite
to
Courcy
Castle
,
and
Augusta
have
be
take
thither
to
meet
him
,
with
the
express
intention
on
the
part
of
the
countess
,
that
they
should
be
man
and
wife
.
<EOS>
the
countess
have
be
careful
to
make
it
intelligible
to
her
sister
-
in
-
law
and
niece
,
that
though
Mr
Moffat
would
do
excellently
well
for
a
daughter
of
Greshamsbury
,
he
could
not
be
allow
to
raise
his
eye
to
a
female
scion
of
Courcy
Castle
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
that
we
personally
dislike
him
,
"
say
the
Lady
Amelia
;
"
but
rank
have
its
drawback
,
Augusta
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
the
Lady
Amelia
be
now
somewhat
near
forty
than
thirty
,
and
be
still
allow
to
walk
,
  
<EOS>
"
in
maiden
meditation
,
fancy
free
,
"
  
<EOS>
it
may
be
presume
that
in
her
case
rank
have
be
find
to
have
serious
drawback
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
Augusta
say
nothing
in
objection
.
<EOS>
whether
desirable
by
a
de
Courcy
or
not
,
the
match
be
to
be
her
,
and
there
be
no
doubt
<EOS>
whatever
as
to
the
wealth
of
the
man
whose
name
she
be
to
take
;
the
offer
have
be
make
,
not
to
her
,
but
to
her
aunt
;
the
acceptance
have
be
express
,
not
by
her
,
but
by
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
have
she
think
of
recapitulate
in
her
memory
all
that
have
ever
pass
between
Mr
Moffat
and
herself
,
she
would
have
find
that
it
do
not
amount
to
more
than
the
most
ordinary
conversation
between
chance
partner
in
a
ball
-
room
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
she
be
to
be
Mrs
Moffat
.
<EOS>
all
that
Mr
Gresham
know
of
him
be
,
that
when
he
meet
the
young
man
for
the
first
and
only
time
in
his
life
,
he
find
him
extremely
hard
to
deal
with
in
the
matter
of
money
.
<EOS>
He
have
insist
on
have
ten
thousand
pound
with
his
wife
,
and
at
last
refuse
to
go
on
with
the
match
unless
he
get
six
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
this
latter
sum
the
poor
squire
have
undertake
to
pay
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Moffat
have
be
for
a
year
or
two
M.P.
for
Barchester
;
have
be
assist
in
his
view
on
that
ancient
city
by
all
the
de
Courcy
interest
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
Whig
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
not
only
have
Barchester
,
depart
from
the
light
of
other
day
,
return
a
Whig
member
of
Parliament
,
but
it
be
declare
,
that
at
the
next
election
,
now
near
at
hand
,
a
Radical
would
be
send
up
,
a
man
pledge
to
the
ballot
,
to
economy
of
all
sort
,
one
who
would
carry
out
Barchester
politic
in
all
their
abrupt
,
obnoxious
,
pestilent
virulence
.
<EOS>
this
be
one
Scatcherd
,
a
great
railway
contractor
,
a
man
who
be
a
native
of
Barchester
,
who
have
buy
property
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
who
have
achieve
a
sort
of
popularity
there
and
elsewhere
by
the
violence
of
his
democratic
opposition
to
the
aristocracy
.
<EOS>
accord
to
this
man
's
political
tenet
,
the
Conservatives
should
be
laugh
at
as
fool
,
but
the
Whigs
should
be
hate
as
knave
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Moffat
be
now
come
down
to
Courcy
Castle
to
look
after
his
electioneer
interest
,
and
Miss
Gresham
be
to
return
with
her
aunt
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
the
countess
be
very
anxious
that
Frank
should
also
accompany
them
.
<EOS>
Her
great
doctrine
,
that
he
must
marry
money
,
have
be
lay
down
with
authority
,
and
receive
without
doubt
.
<EOS>
She
now
push
it
further
,
and
say
that
no
time
should
be
lose
;
that
he
should
not
only
marry
money
,
but
do
so
very
early
in
life
;
there
be
always
danger
in
delay
.
<EOS>
the
Greshams
 
of
course
she
allude
only
to
the
male
of
the
family
 
be
foolishly
soft
-
hearted
;
no
one
could
say
what
may
happen
.
<EOS>
there
be
that
Miss
Thorne
always
at
Greshamsbury
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
more
than
the
Lady
Arabella
could
stand
.
<EOS>
She
protest
that
there
be
at
least
no
ground
for
supposing
that
Frank
would
absolutely
disgrace
his
family
.
  
<EOS>
still
the
countess
persist
:
"
perhaps
not
,
"
she
say
;
"
but
when
young
people
of
perfectly
different
rank
be
allow
to
associate
together
,
there
be
no
say
what
danger
may
arise
.
<EOS>
They
all
know
that
old
Mr
Bateson
 
<EOS>
the
present
Mr
Bateson
's
father
 
have
go
off
with
the
governess
;
and
young
Mr
Everbeery
,
near
Taunton
,
have
only
the
other
day
marry
a
cook
-
maid
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
Mr
Everbeery
be
always
drunk
,
aunt
,
"
say
Augusta
,
feel
call
upon
to
say
something
for
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
never
mind
,
my
dear
;
these
thing
do
happen
,
and
they
be
very
dreadful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
horrible
!
"
say
the
Lady
Amelia
;
"
dilute
the
good
blood
of
the
country
,
and
pave
the
way
for
revolution
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
very
grand
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
Augusta
could
not
but
feel
that
she
perhaps
may
be
about
to
dilute
the
blood
of
her
come
child
in
marry
the
tailor
's
son
.
<EOS>
She
console
herself
by
trust
that
,
at
any
rate
,
she
pave
the
way
for
no
revolution
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
a
thing
be
so
necessary
,
"
say
the
countess
,
"
it
can
not
be
do
too
soon
.
<EOS>
now
,
Arabella
,
I
do
not
say
that
anything
will
come
of
it
;
but
it
may
:
Miss
Dunstable
be
come
down
to
us
next
week
.
<EOS>
now
,
we
all
know
that
when
old
Dunstable
die
last
year
,
he
leave
over
two
hundred
thousand
to
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
great
deal
of
money
,
certainly
,
"
say
Lady
Arabella
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
pay
off
everything
,
and
a
great
deal
more
,
"
say
the
countess
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
ointment
,
be
it
not
,
aunt
?
"
say
Augusta
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
,
my
dear
;
something
call
the
ointment
of
Lebanon
,
or
something
of
that
sort
:
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
doubt
about
the

It

herself
convey
to

a
special
invitation
to
Courcy

him
there

all

We

of
Miss

for
Porlock

once

she
say
,
naïvely
;

<EOS>
but
when
we
find
that

over
two
hundred
thousand

why

that
idea
fall
to
the
ground

"
<EOS>
the
term
on
which
the

it

very
high
indeed

Augusta

here

Augusta

find
him
in
the
bad
of
bad
society

so
at

the
stern
de

would
have
think

<EOS>
Old

how

have
contrive
to
be
off

so
soon
on

rather
,
to

off

<EOS>
have
Lady

in
truth

know
all
her
son

doing
in
this
way

could
she
have
guess
how
very
nigh
he
have
approach
the
iniquity
of
old
Mr
Bateson

and
to
the
folly
of
young
Mr

she
would
in
truth
have
be
in

send
him
off

<EOS>
some
day
before
the
commencement

our

,
young
Frank
have
swear
in
sober
earnest
 
<EOS>
in
what
he
intend
for
his
most
sober
earnest
,
his
most
earnest
sobriety
 
that
he
love
Mary
Thorne
with
a
love
for
which
word
could
find
no
sufficient
expression
 
with
a
love
that
could
never
die
,
never
grow
dim
,
never
become
less
,
which
no
opposition
on
the
part
of
other
could
extinguish
,
which
no
opposition
on
her
part
could
repel
;
that
he
may
,
could
,
would
,
and
should
have
her
for
his
wife
,
and
that
if
she
tell
him
she
do
not
love
him
,
he
would
    
"
<EOS>
oh

oh

<EOS>
Mary

do
you
love

do

<EOS>
do

<EOS>
come
now
,
you
have
a
right
to
give
a
fellow
an
answer
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
such
eloquence
have
the
heir
of
Greshamsbury
,
when
not
yet
twenty
-
one
year
of
age
,
attempt
to
possess
himself
of
the
affection
of
the
doctor
's
niece
.
<EOS>
and
yet
three
day
afterwards
he
be
quite
ready
to
flirt
with
Miss
Oriel
.
  
<EOS>
if
such
thing
be
do
in
the
green
wood
,
what
will
be
do
in
the
dry
?
  
<EOS>
and
what
have
Mary
say
when
these
fervent
protestation
of
an
undying
love
have
be
throw
at
her
foot
?
<EOS>
Mary
,
it
must
be
remember
,
be
very
nearly
of
the
same
age
as
Frank
;
but
,
as
I
and
other
have
so
often
say
before
,
"
woman
grow
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
wall
.
"
<EOS>
though
Frank
be
only
a
boy
,
it
behove
Mary
to
be
something
more
than
a
girl
.
<EOS>
Frank
may
be
allow
,
without
lay
himself
open
to
much
just
reproach
,
to
throw
all
of
what
he
believe
to
be
his
heart
into
a
protestation
of
what
he
believe
to
be
love
;
but
Mary
be
in
duty
bind
to
be
more
thoughtful
,
more
reticent
,
more
aware
of
the
fact
of
their
position
,
more
careful
of
her
own
feeling
,
and
more
careful
also
of
his
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
she
could
not
put
him
down
as
another
young
lady
may
put
down
another
young
gentleman
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
seldom
that
a
young
man
,
unless
he
be
tipsy
,
assume
an
unwelcome
familiarity
in
his
early
acquaintance
with
any
girl
;
but
when
acquaintance
have
be
long
and
intimate
,
familiarity
must
follow
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
Frank
and
Mary
have
be
so
much
together
in
his
holiday
,
have
so
constantly
consort
together
as
boy
and
girl
,
that
,
as
regard
her
,
he
have
not
that
innate
fear
of
a
woman
which
repress
a
young
man
's
tongue
;
and
she
be
so
used
to
his
good
-
humour
,
his
fun
,
and
high
jovial
spirit
,
and
be
,
withal
,
so
fond
of
them
and
him
,
that
it
be
very
difficult
for
her
to
mark
with
accurate
feeling
,
and
stop
with
reserved
brow
,
the
shade
of
change
from
a
boy
's
like
to
a
man
's
love
.
  
<EOS>
and
Beatrice
,
too
,
have
do
harm
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
with
a
spirit
painfully
unequal
to
that
of
her
grand
relative
,
she
have
quiz
Mary
and
Frank
about
their
early
flirtation
.
<EOS>
this
she
have
do
;
but
have
instinctively
avoid
do
so
before
her
mother
and
sister
,
and
have
thus
make
a
secret
of
it
,
as
it
be
,
between
herself
,
Mary
,
and
her
brother
;
 
have
give
currency
,
as
it
be
,
to
the
idea
that
there
may
be
something
serious
between
the
two
.
<EOS>
not
that
Beatrice
have
ever
wish
to
promote
a
marriage
between
them
,
or
have
even
think
of
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
She
be
girlish
,
thoughtless
,
imprudent
,
inartistic
,
and
very
unlike
a
de
Courcy
.
<EOS>
very
unlike
a
de
Courcy
she
be
in
all
that
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
she
have
the
de
Courcy
veneration
for
blood
,
and
,
more
than
that
<EOS>
,
she
have
the
Gresham
feeling
join
to
that
of
the
de
Courcys
.
<EOS>
the
Lady
Amelia
would
not
for
world
have
have
the
de
Courcy
blood
defile
;
but
gold
she
think
could
not
defile
.
<EOS>
now
Beatrice
be
ashamed
of
her
sister
's
marriage
,
and
have
often
declare
,
within
her
own
heart
,
that
nothing
could
have
make
her
marry
a
Mr
Moffat
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
say
so
also
to
Mary
,
and
Mary
have
tell
her
that
she
be
right
.
<EOS>
Mary
also
be
proud
of
blood
,
be
proud
of
her
uncle
's
blood
,
and
the
two
girl
talk
together
in
all
the
warmth
of
girlish
confidence
,
of
the
great
glory
of
family
tradition
and
family
honour
.
<EOS>
Beatrice
have
talk
in
utter
ignorance
as
to
her
friend
's
birth
;
and
Mary
,
poor
Mary
,
she
have
talk
,
be
as
ignorant
;
but
not
without
a
strong
suspicion
that
,
at
some
future
time
,
a
day
of
sorrow
would
tell
her
some
fearful
truth
.
  
<EOS>
on
one
point
Mary
's
mind
be
strongly
make
up
.
<EOS>
no
wealth
,
no
mere
worldly
advantage
could
make
any
one
her
superior
.
<EOS>
if
she
be
bear
a
gentlewoman
,
then
be
she
fit
to
match
with
any
gentleman
.
<EOS>
let
the
most
wealthy
man
in
Europe
pour
all
his
wealth
at
her
foot
,
she
could
,
if
so
inclined
,
give
him
back
at
any
rate
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
that
offer
at
her
foot
<EOS>
she
know
she
would
never
tempt
her
to
yield
up
the
fortress
of
her
heart
,
the
guardianship
of
her
soul
,
the
possession
of
her
mind
;
not
that
alone
,
nor
that
,
even
,
as
any
possible
slight
fraction
of
a
make
-
weight
.
  
<EOS>
if
she
be
bear
a
gentlewoman
!
<EOS>
and
then
come
to
her
mind
those
curious
question
;
what
make
a
gentleman
?
<EOS>
what
make
a
gentlewoman
?
<EOS>
what
be
the
inner
reality
,
the
spiritualise
quintessence
of
that
privilege
in
the
world
which
man
call
rank
,
which
force
the
thousand
and
hundred
of
thousand
to
bow
down
before
the
few
elect
?
<EOS>
what
give
,
or
can
give
it
,
or
should
give
it
?
  
<EOS>
and
she
answer
the
question
.
<EOS>
absolute
,
intrinsic
,
acknowledged
,
individual
merit
must
give
it
to
its
possessor
,
let
him
be
whom
,
and
what
,
and
whence
he
may
.
<EOS>
so
far
the
spirit
of
democracy
be
strong
with
her
.
<EOS>
beyond
this
it
could
be
have
but
by
inheritance
,
receive
as
it
be
second
-
hand
,
or
twenty
-
second
-
hand
.
<EOS>
and
so
far
the
spirit
of
aristocracy
be
strong
within
her
.
<EOS>
all
this
she
have
,
as
may
be
imagine
,
learn
in
early
year
from
her
uncle
;
and
all
this
she
be
at
great
pain
to
teach
Beatrice
Gresham
,
the
choose
of
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
when
Frank
declare
that
Mary
have
a
right
to
give
him
an
answer
,
he
mean
that
he
have
a
right
to
expect
one
.
<EOS>
Mary
acknowledge
this
right
,
and
give
it
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Gresham

"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"

Mary

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

Mr

<EOS>
It
must
be
Mr

that

moreover

it

be
Miss
Thorne

well

you

say
Frank

<EOS>
"
indeed
,
I

Mary

with
a
flash
from
her
eye
that
make
Frank
almost
start

"
I

I

Miss

pray

remember

<EOS>
It
must
be
Miss
Thorne

<EOS>
do
not
turn
me
out
of
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
do
not
separate
me
from
Beatrice

<EOS>
It
be
you
that
will
drive
me
out

no

<EOS>
I
could
stand
my
ground
against
your

<EOS>
I
feel
I
could

I
can
not
stand
against
you
if
you
treat
me
otherwise

otherwise

<EOS>
I
want
to
treat
you

from
all

as
my
wife

<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
you
should
so
soon
have
find
it
necessary
to
make
a
choice
.
<EOS>
but
,
Mr
Gresham
,
we
must
not
joke
about
this
at
present
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
would
not
willingly
injure
me
;
but
if
you
speak
to
me
,
or
of
me
,
again
in
that
way
,
you
will
injure
me
,
injure
me
so
much
that
I
shall
be
force
to
leave
Greshamsbury
in
my
own
defence
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
be
too
generous
to
drive
me
to
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
the
interview
have
end
.
<EOS>
Frank
,
of
course
,
go
upstairs
to
see
if
his
new
pocket
-
pistol
be
all
ready
,
properly
clean
,
load
,
and
cap
,
should
he
find
,
after
a
few
day
"
experience
,
that
prolong
existence
be
unendurable
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
he
manage
to
live
through
the
subsequent
period
;
doubtless
with
a
view
of
prevent
any
disappointment
to
his
father
's
guest
.
   
<EOS>
the
Doctor

Garden
 
<EOS>
Mary
have
contrive
to
quiet
her
lover
with
considerable
propriety
of
demeanour
.
<EOS>
then
come
on
her
the
somewhat
hard
task
of
quiet
herself
.
<EOS>
young
lady
,
on
the
whole
,
be
perhaps
quite
as
susceptible
of
the
soft
feeling
as
young
gentleman
be
.
<EOS>
now
Frank
Gresham
be
handsome
,
amiable
,
by
no
mean
a
fool
in
intellect
,
excellent
in
heart
;
and
he
be
,
moreover
,
a
gentleman
,
be
the
son
of
Mr

of
Greshamsbury

<EOS>
Mary
have
be

as
it

up

him

<EOS>
have
aught
but
good
happen
to
him

she
would
have
cry
as

<EOS>
It
must
not
therefore
be
suppose
that
when
Frank
Gresham
tell
her
that
he
love
her
,
she
have
hear
it
altogether
unconcerned
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
not
,
perhaps
,
make
his
declaration
with
that
propriety
of
language
in
which
such
scene
be
generally
describe
as
be
carry
on
.
<EOS>
lady
may
perhaps
think
that
Mary
should
have
be
deter
,
by
the
very
boyishness
of
his
manner
,
from
think
at
all
seriously
on
the
subject

His
"

sound
like
the
poetic
rapture
of
a
highly
inspire
lover
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
there
have
be
warmth
,
and
a
reality
in
it
not
in
itself
repulsive
;
and
Mary
's
anger
 
anger
?
<EOS>
no
,
not
anger
 
<EOS>
her
objection
to
the
declaration
be
probably
not
base
on
the
absurdity
of
her
lover
's
language
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
inclined
to
think
that
these
matter
be
not
always
discuss
by
mortal
lover
in
the
poetically
passionate
phraseology
which
be
generally
think
to
be
appropriate
for
their
description
.
<EOS>
a
man
can
not
well
describe
that
which
he
have
never
see
nor
hear
;
but
the
absolute
word
and
act
of
one
such
scene
do
once
come
to
the
author
's
knowledge
.
<EOS>
the
couple
be
by
no
means
plebeian
,
or
below
the
proper
standard
of
high
bearing
and
high
breeding
;
they
be
a
handsome
pair
,
live
among
educate
people
,
sufficiently
give
to
mental
pursuit
,
and
in
every
way
what
a
pair
of
polite
lover
ought
to
be
.
<EOS>
the
all
-
important
conversation
pass
in
this
wise
.
<EOS>
the
site
of
the
passionate
scene
be
the
sea
-
shore
,
on
which
they
be
walk
,
in
autumn
.
  
<EOS>
Gentleman

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
Miss

,
the
long
and
short
of
it

this

here
I

you
can
take
me
or
leave
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
 
<EOS>
scratch
a
gutter
on
the
sand
with
her
parasol
,
so
as
to
allow
a
little
salt
water
to
run
out
of
one
hole
into
another
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of
course
,
I
know
that

all
nonsense

"
  
<EOS>
Gentleman

<EOS>
"
nonsense
!
<EOS>
by
Jove

it
be
not

at
all

here
I

come

at
any

you
can
say
something

"
  
<EOS>
Lady

<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
suppose
I
can
say
something
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
which
be
it
to
be

take
me
or
leave
me

"
  
<EOS>
Lady
 
very
slowly
,
and
with
a
voice
perhaps
hardly
articulate
,
carry
on
,
at
the
same
time
,
her
engineering
work
on
a
wide
scale
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
I
do
not
exactly
want
to
leave
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
the
matter
be
settle
:
settle
with
much
propriety
and
satisfaction
;
and
<EOS>
both
the
lady
and
gentleman
would
have
think
,
have
they
ever
think
about
the
matter
at
all
,
that
this
,
the
sweetest
moment
of
their
life
,
have
be
grace
by
all
the
poetry
by
which
such
moment
ought
to
be
hallowed
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mary
have
,
as
she
think
,
properly
subdue
young
Frank
,
the
offer
of
whose
love
she
,
at
any
rate
,
know
be
,
at
such
a
period
of
his
life
,
an
utter
absurdity
,
then
she
find
it
necessary
to
subdue
herself
.
<EOS>
what
happiness
on
earth
could
be
great
than
the
possession
of
such
a
love
,
have
the
true
possession
be
justly
and
honestly
within
her
reach
?
<EOS>
what
man
could
be
more
lovable
than
such
a
man
as
would
grow
from
such
a
boy
?
<EOS>
and
then
,
do
she
not
love
him
,
 
love
him
already
,
without
wait
for
any
change
?
<EOS>
do
she
not
feel
that
there
be
that
about
him
,
about
him
and
about
herself
,
too
,
which
may
so
well
fit
them
for
each
other
?
<EOS>
It
would
be
so
sweet
to
be
the
sister
of
Beatrice
,
the
daughter
of
the
squire
,
to
belong
to
Greshamsbury
as
a
part
and
parcel
of
itself
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
she
could
not
restrain
these
thought
,
it
never
for
a
moment
occur
to
her
to
take
Frank
's
offer
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
though
she
be
a
grown
woman
,
he
be
still
a
boy
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
to
see
the
world
before
he
settle
in
it
,
and
would
change
his
mind
about
woman
half
a
score
of
time
before
he
marry
.
<EOS>
then
,
too
,
though
she
do
not
like
the
Lady
Arabella
<EOS>
,
she
feel
that
she
owe
something
,
if
not
to
her
kindness
,
at
least
to
her
forbearance
;
and
she
know
,
feel
inwardly
certain
,
that
she
would
be
do
wrong
,
that
the
world
would
say
she
be
do
wrong
,
that
her
uncle
would
think
her
wrong
,
if
she
endeavour
to
take
advantage
of
what
have
pass
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
not
for
an
instant
doubt
;
not
for
a
moment
have
she
contemplate
it
as
possible
that
she
should
ever
become
Mrs
Gresham
because
Frank
have
offer
to
make
her
so
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
she
could
not
help
think
of
what
have
occur
 
of
thinking
of
it
,
most
probably
much
more
than
Frank
do
himself
.
  
<EOS>
a
day
or
two
afterwards
,
on
the
evening
before
Frank
's
birthday
,
she
be
alone
with
her
uncle
,
walk
in
the
garden
behind
their
house
,
and
she
then
essay
to
question
him
,
with
the
object
of
learning
if
she
be
fit
by
her
birth
to
be
the
wife
of
such
a
one
as
Frank
Gresham
.
<EOS>
They
be
in
the
habit
of
walk
there
together
when
he
happen
to
be
at
home
of
a
summer
's
evening
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
often
the
case
,
for
his
hour
of
labour
extend
much
beyond
those
usual
to
the
upper
working
world
,
the
hour
,
namely
,
between
breakfast
and
dinner
;
but
those
minute
that
they
do
thus
pass
together
,
the
doctor
regard
as
perhaps
the
pleasantest
of
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
Uncle
,
"
say
she
,
after
a
while
,
"
what
do
you
think
of
this
marriage
of

Gresham

"
  
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
I
be
not

sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
some
folk
would
never

they
have
to
trouble
themselves
with
think
about
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

I
suppose
that

why
you
never

either
that

<EOS>
Mary
have
not
contrive
to
get
at

so
she

to
draw
off
,

after

begin
again

"
Uncle

you

you

<EOS>
Mr

have
that

He

yes

Mary

I

"
a

the

not

he
add
with
an
air
of
decisive
authority

as
though
he
have
finish
the

his

out

,

I

the

therefore

in

I

myself

you

"
no

I
be
Mary
Thorne
;
it
be
a
very
different
thing
,
I

<EOS>
I
suppose
_
I
_
may
marry
any
one
without
degrade
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
almost
ill
-
natured
of
her
to
say
this
;
but
she
have
not
mean
to
say
it
in
the
sense
which
the
sound
seem
to
bear
.
<EOS>
She
have
fail
in
be
able
to
bring
her
uncle
to
the
point
she
wish
by
the
road
she
have
plan
,
and
in
seek
another
road
,
she
have
abruptly
fall
into
unpleasant
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
very
sorry
that
my

think
so
,
"
say
he
;
"

be
sorry
,
too
,
that
she
should
say
so
.
<EOS>
but
,
Mary
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
hardly
know
at
what
you
be
drive
.
<EOS>
You
be
,
I
think
,
not
so
clear
minded
 
certainly
,
not
so
clear
word
 
as
be
usual
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
,
uncle
;
"
and
,
instead
of
look
up
into
his
face
,
she
turn
her
eye
down
on
the
green
lawn
beneath
her
foot
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Minnie
,
what
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
and
he
take
both
her
hand
in
his
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
Miss
Gresham
should
not
marry
Mr
Moffat

<EOS>
I
think
so
because
her
family
be
high
and
noble
,
and
because
he
be
low
and
ignoble

<EOS>
when
one
have
an
opinion
on
such
matter

one
can
not

apply
it
to
thing
and
people
around
one

have
apply
my
opinion
to
her

the
next
step
naturally
be
to
apply
it
to
myself

be
I
Miss

I
would
not

Mr

he
roll
in
gold

I
know
where
to
rank
Miss
Gresham

what
I
want
to
know
be

where
I
ought
to
rank
myself

"
  
<EOS>
They
have
be
stand
when
she
commence
her
last
speech
;
but
as
she
finish
it
,
the
doctor
move
on
again
,
and
she
move
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
walk
on
slowly
without
answer
her
;
and
she
,
out
of
her
full
mind
,
pursue
aloud
the
tenor
of
her
thought
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
a
woman
feel
that
she
would
not
lower
herself
by
marry
in
a
rank
beneath
herself
,
she
ought
also
to
feel
that
she
would
not
lower
a
man
that
she
may
love
by
allow
him
to
marry
into
a
rank
beneath
his

that
is

to
marry
her

<EOS>

that
do
not
follow

the
doctor
quickly
.

"
a
man
raise
a

to
his

standard

a
woman
must
take
that
of

<EOS>
again
they
be
silent
,
and
again
they
walk
on
,
Mary
hold
her
uncle
's
arm
with
both
her
hand

<EOS>
She
be
determine

however

to
come
to
the
point

after
consider
for
a
while
how
best
she
may
do
it

she
cease
to
beat
any
longer
about
the

ask
him
a
plain
question

"
the
Thornes

good

in
absolute
genealogy
they
be

my

<EOS>
that
is

when
I
choose

talk
of
such
matter
in
a
sense
different

I
may

well

I
should
be
sorry

so
seriously

<EOS>
and
she
throw

on

with

there
be

<EOS>
Mary
ask
no

question

nor
do
the

volunteer
further
information

<EOS>
She
would
have
be
most
anxious
to
ask
about
her
mother
's
history
<EOS>
have
she
dare
to
do
so
;
but
she
do
not
dare
to
ask
;
she
could
not
bear
to
be
tell
that
her
mother
have
be
,
perhaps
be
,
a
worthless
woman
.
<EOS>
that
she
be
truly
a
daughter
of
a
brother
of
the
doctor

that
she
do
know
.
<EOS>
little
as
she
have
hear
of
her
relative
in

early
youth

few
as
have
be
the
word
which
have
fall
from
her
uncle

hearing
as
to

parentage

she
do
know
this
,
that
she
be
the
daughter
of
Henry
Thorne

a
brother
of
the
doctor
,
and
a
son
of
the
old
prebendary
.
<EOS>
trifle
little
thing
that
have
occur
,
accident
which
could
not
be
prevent
,
have
tell
her
this
;
but
not
a
word
have
ever
pass
any
one
's
lip
as
to
her
mother
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
when
speak
of
his
youth
,
have
speak
of
her
father
;
but
no
one
have
speak
of
her
mother
.
<EOS>
She
have
long
know
that
she
be
the
child
of
a
Thorne
;
now
she
know
also
that
she
be
no
cousin
of
the
Thornes
of
Ullathorne
;
no
cousin
,
at
least
,
in
the
world
's
ordinary
language
,
no
niece
indeed
of
her
uncle
,
unless
by
his
special
permission

she
should
be
so

<EOS>
when
the
interview
be
over

she
go
up
alone
to
the
drawing

room

there
she
sit
think
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
be
there
long
before
her
uncle
come
up
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
sit
down
,
or
even
take
off
the
hat
which
he
still
wear
;
but
come
close
to
her
,
and
still
stand
,
he
speak
thus
:
    
"
Mary
,
after
what
have
pass
I
should
be
very
unjust
and
very
cruel
to
you
not
to
tell
you
one
thing
more
than
you
have
now
learn
.
<EOS>
Your
mother
be
unfortunate
in
much
,
not
in
everything
;
but
the
world
,
which
be
very
often
stern
in
such
matter
,
never
judge
her
to
have
disgrace
herself
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
this
,
my
child
,
in
order
that
you
may
respect
her
memory
;
"
and
so
say
,
he
again
leave
her
without
give
her
time
to
speak
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
what
he
then
tell
her
he
have
tell
in
mercy
.
<EOS>
He
feel
what
must
be
her
feeling
when
she
reflect
that
she
have
to
blush
for
her
mother
;
that
not
only
could
she
not
speak
of
her
mother
,
but
that
she
may
hardly
think
of
her
with
innocence
;
and
to
mitigate
such
sorrow
as
this
,
and
also
to
do
justice
to
the
woman
whom
his
brother
have
so
wrong
,
he
have
force
himself
to
reveal
so
much
as
be
state
above
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
he
walk
slowly
by
himself
,
backwards
and
forwards
through
the
garden
,
thinking
of
what
he
have
do
with
reference
to
this
girl
,
and
doubt
whether
he
have
do
wisely
and
well
.
<EOS>
He
have
resolve
,
when
first
the
little
infant
be
give
over
to
his
charge
,
that
nothing
should
be
know
of
her
or
by
her
as
to
her
mother
.
<EOS>
He
be
willing
to
devote
himself
to
this
orphan
child
of
his
brother
,
this
last
seedling
of
his
father
's
house
;
but
he
be
not
willing
so
to
do
this
as
to
bring
himself
in
any
manner
into
familiar
contact
with
the
Scatcherds
.
<EOS>
He
have
boast
to
himself
that
he
,
at
any
rate
,
be
a
gentleman
;
and
that
she
,
if
she
be
to
live
in
his
house
,
sit
at
his
table
,
and
share
his
hearth
,
must
be
a
lady
.
<EOS>
He
would
tell
no
lie
about
her
;
he
would
not
to
any
one
make
her
out
to
be
aught
other
or
aught
better
than
she
be
;
people
would
talk
about
her
of
course
<EOS>
,
only
let
them
not
talk
to
him
;
he
conceive
of
himself
 
and
the
conception
be
not
without
due
ground
 
<EOS>
that
should
any
do
so
<EOS>
,
he
have
that
within
him
which
would
silence
them
.
<EOS>
He
would
never
claim
for
this
little
creature
 
thus
bring
into
the
world
without
a
legitimate
position
in
which
to
stand
 
he
would
never
claim
for
her
any
station
that
would
not
properly
be
her
own
.
<EOS>
He
would
make
for
her
a
station
as
best
he
could
.
<EOS>
as
he
may
sink
or
swim
,
so
should
she
.
  
<EOS>
so
he
have
resolve
;
but
thing
have
arrange
themselves
,
as
they
often
do
,
rather
than
be
arrange
by
him
.
<EOS>
during
ten
or
twelve
year
no
one
have
hear
of
Mary
Thorne
;
the
memory
of
Henry
Thorne
and
his
tragic
death
have
pass
away
;
the
knowledge
that
an
infant
have
be
bear
whose
birth
be
connect
with
that
tragedy
,
a
knowledge
never
widely
spread
,
have
fade
down
into
utter
ignorance
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
these
twelve
year
,
Dr
Thorne
have
announce
,
that
a
young
niece
,
a
child
of
a
brother
long
since
dead
,
be
come
to
live
with
him
.
<EOS>
as
he
have
contemplate
,
no
one
speak
to
him
;
but
some
people
do
no
doubt
talk
among
themselves
.
<EOS>
whether
or
not
the
exact
truth
be
surmise
by
any
,
it
matter
not
to
say
;
with
absolute
exactness
,
probably
not
;
with
great
approach
to
it
,
probably
yes
.
<EOS>
by
one
person
,
at
any
rate
,
no
guess
whatever
be
make
;
no
thought
relative
to
Dr
Thorne
's
niece
ever
trouble
him
;
no
idea
that
Mary
Scatcherd
have
leave
a
child
in
England
ever
occur
to
him
;
and
that
person
be
Roger
Scatcherd
,
Mary
's
brother
.
  
<EOS>
to
one
friend
,
and
only
one
,
do
the
doctor
tell
the
whole
truth
,
and
that
be
to
the
old
squire
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
tell
you
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
partly
that
you
may
know
that
the
child
have
no
right
to
mix
with
your
child
if
you
think
much
of
such
thing
.
<EOS>
do
you
,
however
,
see
to
this
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
that
no
one
else
should
be
tell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
no
one
else
have
be
tell
;
and
the
squire
have
"
see
to
it
,
"
by
accustom
himself
to
look
at
Mary
Thorne
run
about
the
house
with
his
own
child
as
though
she
be
of
the
same
brood
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
squire
have
always
be
fond
of
Mary
,
have
personally
notice
her
,
and
,
in
the
affair
of
Mam'selle
Larron
,
have
declare
that
he
would
have
her
place
at
once
on
the
bench
of
magistrate
;
 
much
to
the
disgust
of
the
Lady
Arabella
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
thing
have
go
on
and
on
,
and
have
not
be
think
of
with
much
downright
thinking
;
till
now
,
when
she
be
one
-
and
-
twenty
year
of
age
,
his
niece
come
to
him
,
ask
as
to
her
position
,
and
inquire
in
what
rank
of
life
she
be
to
look
for
a
husband
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
the
doctor
walk
backwards
and
forwards
through
the
garden
,
slowly
,
think
now
with
some
earnestness
what
if
,
after
all
,
he
have
be
wrong
about
his
niece
?
<EOS>
what
if
by
endeavour
to
place
her
in
the
position
of
a
lady
,
he
have
falsely
so
place
her
,
and
rob
her
of
all
legitimate
position
?
<EOS>
what
if
there
be
no
rank
of
life
to
which
she
could
now
properly
attach
herself
?
  
<EOS>
and
then
,
how
have
it
answer
,
<EOS>
that
plan
of
his
of
keep
her
all
to
himself
?
<EOS>
He
,
Dr
Thorne
,
be
still
a
poor
man
;
the
gift
of
save
money
have
not
be
his
;
he
have
ever
have
a
comfortable
house
for
her
to
live
in
,
and
,
in
spite
of
doctor
Fillgrave
,
Century
,
Rerechild
,
and
other
,
have
make
from
his
profession
an
income
sufficient
for
their
joint
want
;
but
he
have
not
do
as
other
do
:
he
have
no
three
or
four
thousand
pound
in
the
three
per
Cents
.
<EOS>
on
which
Mary
may
live
in
some
comfort
when
he
should
die
.
<EOS>
late
in
life
he
have
insure
his
life
for
eight
hundred
pound
;
and
to
that
,
and
that
only
,
have
he
to
trust
for
Mary
's
future
maintenance
.
<EOS>
how
have
it
answer
,
then
,
this
plan
of
let
her
be
unknown
to
,
and
undreame
of
by
,
those
who
be
as
near
to
her
on
her
mother
's
side
as
he
be
on
the
father
's
?
<EOS>
on
that
side
,
though
there
have
be
utter
poverty
,
there
be
now
absolute
wealth
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
he
take
her
to
himself
,
have
he
not
rescue
her
from
the
very
depth
of
the
low
misery
:
from
the
degradation
of
the
workhouse
;
from
the
scorn
of
honest
-
bear
charity
-
child
;
from
the
low
of
the
world
's
low
condition
?
<EOS>
be
she
not
now
the
apple
of
his
eye
,
his
one
great
sovereign
comfort
 
<EOS>
his
pride
,
his
happiness
,
his
glory
?
<EOS>
be
he
to
make
her
over
,
to
make
any
portion
of
her
over
to
other
,
if
,
by
do
so
,
she
may
be
able
to
share
the
wealth
,
as
well
as
the
coarse
manner
and
uncouth
society
of
her
at
present
unknown
connexion
?
<EOS>
He
,
who
have
never
worship
wealth
on
his
own
behalf
;
he
,
who
have
scorn
the
idol
of
gold
,
and
have
ever
be
teach
her
to
scorn
it
;
be
he
now
to
show
that
his
philosophy
have
all
be
false
as
soon
as
the
temptation
to
do
so
be
put
in
his
way
?
  
<EOS>
but
yet
,
what
man
would
marry
this
bastard
child
,
without
a
sixpence
,
and
bring
not
only
poverty
,
but
ill
blood
also
on
his
own
child
?
<EOS>
It
may
be
very
well
for
him
,
Dr
Thorne
;
for
him
whose
career
be
make
,
whose
name
,
at
any
rate
,
be
his
own
;
for
him
who
have
a
fix
standing
-
ground
in
the
world
;
it
may
be
well
for
him
to
indulge
in
large
view
of
a
philosophy
antagonistic
to
the
world
's
practice
;
but
have
he
a
right
to
do
it
for
his
niece
?
<EOS>
what
man
would
marry
a
girl
so
place
?
<EOS>
for
those
among
whom
she
may
have
legitimately
find
a
level
,
education
have
now
utterly
unfitted
her
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
he
well
know
that
she
would
never
put
out
her
hand
in
token
of
love
to
any
one
without
tell
all
she
know
and
all
she
surmise
as
to
her
own
birth
.
  
<EOS>
and
that
question
of
this
evening
;
have
it
not
be
instigate
by
some
appeal
to
her
heart
?
<EOS>
be
there
not
already
within
her
breast
some
cause
for
disquietude
which
have
make
her
so
pertinacious
?
<EOS>
why
else
have
she
tell
him
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
she
do
not
know
where
to
rank
herself
?
<EOS>
if
such
an
appeal
have
be
make
to
her
,
it
must
have
come
from
young
Frank
Gresham
.
<EOS>
what
,
in
such
case
,
would
it
behove
him
to
do
?
<EOS>
Should
he
pack
up
his
all
,
his
lancet
-
case
,
pestle
and
mortar
,
and
seek
anew
fresh
ground
in
a
new
world
,
leave
behind
a
huge
triumph
to
those
learn
enemy
of
his
,
Fillgrave
,
Century
,
and
Rerechild
?
<EOS>
better
that
than
remain
at
Greshamsbury
at
the
cost
of
his
child
's
heart
and
pride
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
he
walk
slowly
backwards
and
forwards
through
his
garden
,
meditate
these
thing
painfully
enough
.
   
<EOS>
matrimonial
prospect
 
<EOS>
It
will
of
course
be
remember
that
Mary
's
interview
with
the
other
girl
at
Greshamsbury
take
place
some
two
or
three
day
subsequently
to
Frank
's
generous
offer
of
his
hand
and
heart
.
<EOS>
Mary
have
quite
make
up
her
mind
that
the
whole
thing
be
to
be
regard
as
a
folly
,
and
that
it
be
not
to
be
speak
of
to
any
one
;
but
yet
her
heart
be
sore
enough
.
<EOS>
She
be
full
of
pride
,
and
yet
she
know
she
must
bow
her
neck
to
the
pride
of
other
.
<EOS>
be
,
as
she
be
herself
,
nameless
,
she
could
not
but
feel
a
stern
,
unflinche
antagonism
,
the
antagonism
of
a
democrat
,
to
the
pretension
of
other
who
be
bless
with
that
of
which
she
have
be
deprive
.
<EOS>
She
have
this
feeling
;
and

She

that
God

handiwork

the
inner

the
inner

the

that
all

all

<EOS>
be
it
not

her
capacity
to
do
as
nobly
,
to
love
as
truly

to
worship
her
God

<EOS>
so
to
herself
she
speak
;
and
yet
,
as
she
say
it
,
she
know
that
be
she
a
man
,
such
a
man
as
the
heir
of
Greshamsbury

nothing
would
tempt
her
to
sully
her

herself
with
any
one
that

<EOS>
She
feel
that
be
she
an
Augusta
Gresham
,
no
Mr
Moffat
,
<EOS>
let
his
wealth
be
what
it
may

should
win
her
hand
unless
he
too
could
tell
of
family
honour
and
a
line
of
ancestor
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
,
with
a
mind
at
war
with
itself
,
she
come
forth
armed
to
do
battle
against
the
world
's
prejudice
,
those
prejudice
she
herself
love
so
well
.
  
<EOS>
and
be
she
to
give
up
her
old
affection
<EOS>
,
her
feminine
love
,
because
she
find
that
she
be
a
cousin
to
nobody
?
<EOS>
be
she
no
longer
to
pour
out
her
heart
to
Beatrice
Gresham
with
all
the
girlish
volubility
of
an
equal
?
<EOS>
be
she
to
be
sever
from
Patience
Oriel
,
and
banish
 
or
rather
be
she
to
banish
herself
 
from
the
free
place
she
have
maintain
in
the
various
youthful
female
conclave
hold
within
that
parish
of
Greshamsbury
?
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
what
Mary
Thorne
would
say
,
what
Miss
Thorne
suggest
in
such
or
such
a
matter
,
be
quite
as
frequently
ask
as
any
opinion
from
Augusta
Gresham
 
quite
as
frequently
,
unless
when
it
chance
that
any
of
the
de
Courcy
girl
be
at
the
house
.
<EOS>
be
this
to
be
give
up
?
<EOS>
these
feeling
have
grow
up
among
them
since
they
be
child
,
and
have
not
hitherto
be
question
among
them
.
<EOS>
now
they
be
question
by
Mary
Thorne
.
<EOS>
be
she
in
fact
to
find
that
her
position
have
be
a
false
one
,
and
must
be
change
?
  
<EOS>
such
have
be
her
feeling
when
she
protest
that
she
would
not
be
Augusta
Gresham
's
bridesmaid
,
and
offer
to
put
her
neck
beneath
Beatrice
's
foot
;
when
she
drive
the
Lady
Margaretta
out
of
the
room
,
and
give
her
own
opinion
as
to
the
proper
grammatical
construction
of
the
word
humble
;
such
also
have
be
her
feeling
when
she
keep
her
hand
so
rigidly
to
herself
while
Frank
hold
the
dining
-
room
door
open
for
her
to
pass
through
.
  
<EOS>
"
Patience
Oriel
,
"
say
she
to
herself
,
"
can
talk
to
him
of
her
father
and
mother
:
let
Patience
take
his
hand
;
let
her
talk
to
him
;
"
and
then
,
not
long
afterwards
,
she
see
that
Patience
do
talk
to
him
;
and
see
it
,
she
walk
along
silent
,
among
some
of
the
old
people
,
and
with
much
effort
do
prevent
a
tear
from
fall
down
her
cheek
.
  
<EOS>
but
why
be
the
tear
in
her
eye
?
<EOS>
have
she
not
proudly
tell
Frank
that
his
love
-
making
be
nothing
but
a
boy
's
silly
rhapsody
?
<EOS>
have
she
not
say
so
while
she
have
yet
reason
to
hope
that
her
blood
be
as
good
as
his
own
?
<EOS>
have
she
not
see
at
a
glance
that
his
love
tirade
be
worthy
of
ridicule
,
and
of
no
other
notice
?
<EOS>
and
yet
there
be
a
tear
now
in
her
eye
because
this
boy
,
whom
she
have
scold
from
her
,
whose
hand
,
offer
in
pure
friendship
,
she
have
just
refuse
,
because
he
,
so
rebuff
by
her
,
have
carry
his
fun
and
gallantry
to
one
who
would
be
less
cross
to
him
!
  
<EOS>
She
could
hear
as
she
be
walk
,
that
while
Lady
Margaretta
be
with
them
,
their
voice
be
loud
and
merry
;
and
her
sharp
ear
could
also
hear
,
when
Lady
Margaretta
leave
them
,
that
Frank
's
voice
become
low
and
tender
.
<EOS>
so
she
walk
on
,
say
nothing
,
look
straight
before
her
,
and
by
degree
separate
herself
from
all
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
the
Greshamsbury
ground
be
on
one
side
somewhat
too
closely
hem
in
by
the
village
.
<EOS>
on
this
side
be
a
path
run
the
length
of
one
of
the
street
of
the
village
;
and
far
down
the
path
,
near
to
the
extremity
of
the
gardens
,
and
near
also
to
a
wicket
-
gate
which
lead
out
into
the
village
,
and
which
could
be
open
from
the
inside
,
be
a
seat
,
under
a
big
yew
-
tree
,
from
which
,
through
a
breach
in
the
house
,
may
be
see
the
parish
church
,
stand
in
the
park
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
Hither
Mary
walk
alone
,
and
here
she
seat
herself
,
determine
to
get
rid
of
her
tear
and
their
trace
before
she
again
show
herself
to
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
be
happy
here
again
,
"
say
she
to
herself
;
"
never
.
<EOS>
I
be
no
longer
one
of
them
,
and
I
can
not
live
among
them
unless
I
be
so
.
<EOS>
"
and
then
an
idea
come
across
her
mind
that
she
hate
Patience
Oriel
;
and
then
,
instantly
another
idea
follow
it
 
quick
as
such
thought
be
quick
 
that
she
do
not
hate
Patience
Oriel
at
all
;
that
she
like
her
,
nay
,
love
her
;
that
Patience
Oriel
be
a
sweet
girl
;
and
that
she
hope
the
time
would
come
when
she
may
see
her
the
lady
of
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
and
then
the
tear
,
which
have
be
no
whit
control
,
which
indeed
have
now
make
itself
master
of
her
,
come
to
a
head
,
and
,
burst
through
the
floodgate
of
the
eye
,
come
roll
down
,
and
in
its
fall
,
wet
her
hand
as
it
lie
on
her
lap

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
a
fool
!
<EOS>
what
an
idiot

<EOS>
what
an
empty

headed
cowardly
fool
I
be

"
<EOS>
say
she
,
spring
up
from
the
bench
on
her
foot
.
  
<EOS>
as
she
do
so
,
she
hear
voice
close
to
her
,
at
the
little
gate
.
<EOS>
They
be
those
of
her
uncle
and
Frank
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
Frank
!
"
say
the
doctor
,
as
he
pass
out
of
the
ground
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
excuse
a
lecture
,
will
not
you
,
from
so
old
a
friend
?
 
<EOS>
though
you
be
a
man
now
,
and
discreet
,
of
course
,
by
Act
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
will
,
doctor
,
"
say
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
excuse
a
long
lecture
than
that
from
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
at
any
rate
it
will
not
be
to
-
night
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
as
he
disappear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
if
you
see
Mary
,
tell
her
that
I
be
oblige
to
go
;
and
that
I
will
send
Janet
down
to
fetch
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
now
Janet
be
the
doctor
's
ancient
maid
-
servant
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
could
not
move
on
without
be
perceive
;
she
therefore
stand
still
till
she
hear
the
click
of
the
door
,
and
then
begin
walk
rapidly
back
to
the
house
by
the
path
which
have
bring
her
thither
.
<EOS>
the
moment
,
however
,
that
she
do
so
,
she
find
that
she
be
follow
;
and
in
a
very
few
moment
Frank
be
alongside
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mary
!
"
say
he
,
call
to
her
,
but
not
loudly
,
before
he
quite
overtake
her
,
"
how
odd
that
I
should
come
across
you
just
when
I
have
a
message
for
you
!
<EOS>
and
why
be
you
all
alone
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
's
first
impulse
be
to
reiterate
her
command
to
him
to
call
her
no
more
by
her
christian
name
;
but
her
second
impulse
tell
her
that
such
an
injunction
at
the
present
moment
would
not
be
prudent
on
her
part
.
<EOS>
the
trace
of
her
tear
be
still
there
;
and
she
well
know
that
a
very
little
,
the
slight
show
of
tenderness
on
his
part
,
the
slight
effort
on
her
own
to
appear
indifferent
,
would
bring
down
more
than
one
other
such
intruder
.
<EOS>
It
would
,
moreover
,
be
well
for
her
to
drop
all
outward
sign
that
she
remember
what
have
take
place
.
<EOS>
so
long
,
then
,
as
he
and
she
be
at
Greshamsbury
together
,
he
should
call
her
Mary
if
he
please
.
<EOS>
He
would
soon
be
go
;
and
while
he
remain
,
she
would
keep
out
of
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
uncle
have
be
oblige
to
go
away
to
see
an
old
woman
at
Silverbridge
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
at
Silverbridge
!
<EOS>
why
,
he
will
not
be
back
all
night
.
<EOS>
why
could
not
the
old
woman
send
for
Dr
Century
?
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
I
suppose
she
think
two
old
woman
could
not
get
on
well
together

<EOS>
Mary
could
not
help
smile
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
like
her
uncle
go
off
so
late
on
such
a
journey
;
but
it
be
always
feel
as
a
triumph

he
be
invite
into
the
stronghold
of
his
enemy

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
Janet
be
to
come
over
for
you

<EOS>
however
,
I
tell
him
it
be
quite
unnecessary
to
disturb
another
old
woman
,
for
that
I
should
of
course
see
you
home

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh

no

Mr
Gresham
;
indeed
you
will
not

indeed

and
indeed

I
shall

<EOS>

what

<EOS>
on
this
great
day
,
when
every

be
look
for

and
talk

you

<EOS>
I
suppose
you
want
to
set
the
countess
against
me
for
ever
.
<EOS>
think
,
too
,
how
angry
Lady
Arabella
will
be
if
you
be
absent
on
such
an
errand
as
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
to
hear
you
talk
,
Mary
,
one
would
think
that
you
be
go
to
Silverbridge
yourself

"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
be

"
  
<EOS>
"
if

some
of

John

George
 
"
  
"
good
gracious
,
Frank

<EOS>
fancy
either
of
the
Mr
de
Courcys
walk
home
with
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
have
forget
herself
,
and
the
strict
propriety
on
which
she
have
resolve
,
in
the
impossibility
of
forgo
her
little
joke
against
the
de
Courcy
grandeur
;
she
have
forget
herself
,
and
have
call
him
Frank
in
her
old
,
former
,
eager
,
free
tone
of
voice
;
and
then
,
remember
she
have
do
so
,
she
draw
herself
up
,
but
her
lip
,
and
determine
to
be
doubly
on
her
guard
in
the
future

<EOS>
"
well
,
it
shall
be
either
one
of
them

I

Frank
:
"
perhaps
you
would
prefer
my
cousin
George
to
me

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
prefer
Janet

either

considerable

"
oh

<EOS>
pray
do
not

Mr
Gresham

<EOS>
I
should
not
like
it
at
all

say
she
:

a

would
be
preferable

<EOS>
"
  
"
of
course

<EOS>
anything

I

certainly
;
anything

if
I

it

"
  
<EOS>
Frank
Gresham
feel
disconcert
,
though
he
hardly
know
why
.
<EOS>
He
be
strive
to
say
something
tender
to
his
lady
-
love
;
but
every
word
that
he
speak
she
turn
into
joke
.
<EOS>
Mary
do
not
answer
him
coldly
or
unkindly
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
be
displeased
.
<EOS>
one
do
not
like
to
have
one
's
little
offering
of
sentimental
service
turn
into
burlesque
when
one
be
in
love
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
Mary
's
joke
have
appear
so
easy
too
;
they
seem
to
come
from
a
heart
so
little
troubled
.
<EOS>
this
,
also
,
be
cause
of
vexation
to
Frank
.
<EOS>
if
he
could
but
have
know
all
,
he
would
,
perhaps
,
have
be
better
pleased
.
  
<EOS>
He
determine
not
to
be
absolutely
laugh
out
of
his
tenderness
.
<EOS>
when
,
three
day
ago
,
he
have
be
repulse
,
he
have
go
away
own
to
himself
that
he
have
be
beat
;
own
so
much
,
but
own
it
with
great
sorrow
and
much
shame
.
<EOS>
since
that
he
have
come
of
age
;
since
that
he
have
make
speech
,
and
speech
have
be
make
to
him
;
since
that

have
gain
courage
by
flirt
with
Patience
Oriel
.
<EOS>
no
faint
heart
ever
win
a
fair
lady
,
as
he
be
well
aware
;
he
resolve
,
therefore
,
that
his
heart
should
not
be
faint
,
and
that
he
would
see
whether
the
fair
lady

<EOS>
"
Mary
,
"
say
he
,
stop
in
the
path
 
for
they
be
now
near
the
spot
where
it
break
out
upon
the
lawn
,
and
they
could
already
hear
the
voice
of
the
guest
 
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
you
be
unkind
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
aware
of
it
,
Mr
Gresham
;
but
if
I
be
,
do
not
you
retaliate
.
<EOS>
I
be
weak
than
you
,
and
in
your
power
;
do
not
you
,
therefore
,
be
unkind
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
refuse
my
hand
just
now
,
"
continue
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of
all
the
people
here
at
Greshamsbury
,
you
be
the
only
one
that
have
not
wish
me
joy
;
the
only
one
 
"
  
"
I
do
wish
you
joy
;
I
will
wish
you
joy
;
there
be
my
hand
,
"
and
she
frankly
put
out
her
ungloved
hand
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
quite
man
enough
to
understand
me
:
there
be
my
hand
;
I
trust
you
use
it
only
as
it
be
mean
to
be
use
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
it
in
his
and
press
it
cordially
,
as
he
may
have
do
that
of
any
other
friend
in
such
a
case
;
and
then
 
do
not
drop
it
as
he
should
have
do
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
St
Anthony
,
and
it
be
most
imprudent
in
Miss
Thorne
to
subject
him
to
such
a
temptation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
"
say
he
;
"
dear
Mary
!
<EOS>
dearest
Mary
!
<EOS>
if
you
do
but
know
how
I
love
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
as
he
say
this
,
hold
Miss
Thorne
's
hand
,
he
stand
on
the
pathway
with
his
back
towards
the
lawn
and
house
,
and
,
therefore
,
do
not
at
first
see
his
sister
Augusta
,
who
have
just
at
that
moment
come
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Mary
blush
up
to
her
straw
hat
,
and
,
with
a
quick
jerk
,
recover
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Augusta
see
the
motion
,
and
Mary
see
that
Augusta
have
see
it
.
  
<EOS>
from
my
tedious
way
of
tell
it
,
the
reader
will
be
lead
to
imagine
that
the
hand
-
squeezing
have
be
protract
to
a
duration
quite
incompatible
with
any
objection
to
such
an
arrangement
on
the
part
of
the
lady
;
but
the
fault
be
mine
:
in
no
part
her
.
<EOS>
be
I
possess
of
a
quick
spasmodic
style
of
narrative
,
I
should
have
be
able
to
include
it
all
 
Frank
's
misbehaviour
,
Mary
's
immediate
anger
,
Augusta
's
arrival
,
and
keen
,
argus
-
eyed
inspection
,
and
then
Mary
's
subsequent
misery
 
in
five
word
and
half
a
dozen
dash
and
invert
comma
.
<EOS>
the
thing
should
have
be
so
tell
;
for
,
to
do
Mary
justice
,
she
do
not
leave
her
hand
in
Frank
's
a
moment
longer
than
she
could
help
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
,
feel
the
hand
withdraw
,
and
hearing
,
when
it
be
too
late
,
the
step
on
the
gravel
,
turn
sharply
round
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
it
be
you
,
be
it
,
Augusta
?
<EOS>
well
,
what
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Augusta
be
not
naturally
very
ill
-
natured
,
see
that
in
her
vein
the
high
de
Courcy
blood
be
somewhat
temper
by
an
admixture
of
the
Gresham
attribute
;
nor
be
she
predispose
to
make
her
brother
her
enemy
by
publish
to
the
world
any
of
his
little
tender
peccadillo
;
but
she
could
not
but
bethink
herself
of
what
her
aunt
have
be
say
as
to
the
danger
of
any
such
encounter
as
that
she
just
now
have
behold
;
she
could
not
but
start
at
see
her
brother
thus
,
on
the
very
brink
of
the
precipice
of
which
the
countess
have
specially
forewarn
her
mother
.
<EOS>
She
,
Augusta
,
be
,
as
she
well
know
,
do
her
duty
by
her
family
by
marry
a
tailor
's
son
for
whom
she
do
not
care
a
chip
,
see
the
tailor
's
son
be
possess
of
untold
wealth
.
<EOS>
now
when
one
member
of
a
household
be
make
a
struggle
for
a
family
,
it
be
painful
to
see
the
benefit
of
that
struggle
negative
by
the
folly
of
another
member
.
<EOS>
the
future
Mrs
Moffat
do
feel
aggrieved
by
the
fatuity
of
the
young
heir
,
and
,
consequently
,
take
upon
herself
to
look
as
much
like
her
Aunt
de
Courcy
as
she
could
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
what
be
it
?
"
say
Frank
,
look
rather
disgusted
.
<EOS>
"
what
make
you
stick
your
chin
up
and
look
in
that
way
?
<EOS>
"
Frank
have
hitherto
be
rather
a
despot
among
his
sister
,
and
forget
that
the
eld
of
them
be
now
pass
altogether
from
under
his
sway
to
that
of
the
tailor
's
son
.
  
<EOS>
"
Frank
,
"
say
Augusta
,
in
a
tone
of
voice
which
do
honour
to
the
great
lesson
she
have
lately
receive
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Aunt
de
Courcy
want
to
see
you
immediately
in
the
small
drawing
-
room
;
"
and
,
as
she
say
so
,
she
resolve
to
say
a
few
word
of
advice
to
Miss
Thorne
as
soon
as
her
brother
should
have
leave
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
the
small
drawing
-
room
,
do
she
?
<EOS>
well
,
Mary
,
we
may
as
well
go
together
,
for
I
suppose
it
be
tea
-
time
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
go
at
once
,
Frank
,
"
say
Augusta
;
"
the
countess
will
be
angry
if
you
keep
her
waiting
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
expect
you
these
twenty
minute
.
<EOS>
Mary
Thorne
and
I
can
return
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
the
tone
in
which
the
word
,
"
Mary
Thorne
,
"
be
utter
,
which
make
Mary
at
once
draw
herself
up
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
say
she
,
"
that
Mary
Thorne
will
never
be
any
hindrance
to
either
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
's
ear
have
also
perceive
that
there
be
something
in
the
tone
of
his
sister
's
voice
not
bode
comfort
to
Mary
;
he
perceive
that
the
de
Courcy
blood
in
Augusta
's
vein
be
already
rebel
against
the
doctor
's
niece
on
his
part
,
though
it
have
condescend
to
submit
itself
to
the
tailor
's
son
on
her
own
part
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
be
go
,
"
say
he
;
"
but
look
here
Augusta
,
if
you
say
one
word
of
Mary
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
oh
,
Frank
!
<EOS>
Frank

<EOS>
you
boy
,
you
very
boy
!
<EOS>
you
goose

<EOS>
you
silly
goose

<EOS>
be
that
the
way
you
make
love
,
desire
one

not
to
tell
of
another

as
though
you
be
three
child
,
tear
your
frock
and
trouser
in
get
through
the
same
hedge
together
?
<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
Frank

<EOS>
you

You

already

with
a
man

discretion

<EOS>
You

the
forward

that
do

now
threaten
young
Harry
Baker
and
the
honourable
John
to
eclipse
them
by
prowess
in
the
field

<EOS>
You
,
of
age

<EOS>
why
,
thou
canst
not
as
yet
have
leave
thy
mother
's
apron
-
string
!
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
say
one
word
of
Mary
 
<EOS>
"
  
so
far
have
he
get
in
his
injunction
to
his
sister
,
but
further
than
that
,
in
such
a
case
,
be
he
never
destine
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
Mary
's
indignation
flash
upon
him
,
strike
him
dumb
long
before
the
sound
of
her
voice
reach
his
ear
;
and
yet
she
speak
as
quick
as
the
word
would
come
to
her
call
,
and
somewhat
loudly
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
say
one
word
of
Mary
,
Mr
Gresham
!
<EOS>
and
why
should
she
not
say
as
many
word
of
Mary
as
she
may
please
?
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
all
now
,
Augusta
!
<EOS>
and
I
must
also
beg
you
not
to
be
silent
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
I
be
concerned
,
tell
it
to
whom
you
please

<EOS>
this
be
the
second
time
your
brother
 
"
  
"
Mary
,
Mary
,
"
say
Frank
,
deprecate
her
loquacity
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr
Gresham
;
you
have
make
it
necessary
that
I
should
tell
your
sister
all
.
<EOS>
He
have
now
twice
think
it
well
to
amuse
himself
by
say
to
me
word
which
it
be
ill
-
natured
in
him
to
speak
,
and
 
"
  
"
Ill
-
natured
,
Mary
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ill
-
natured
in
him
to
speak
,
"
continue
Mary
,
"
and
to
which
it
would
be
absurd
for
me
to
listen
.
<EOS>
He
probably
do
the
same
to
other
,
"
she
add
,
be
unable
in
heart
to
forget
that
sharpest
of
her
wound
,
that
flirtation
of
his
with
Patience
Oriel
;
"
but
to
me
it
be
almost
cruel
.
<EOS>
another
girl
may
laugh
at
him
,
or
listen
to
him
,
as
she
would
choose
;
but
I
can
do
neither
.
<EOS>
I
shall
now
keep
away
from
Greshamsbury
,
at
any
rate
till
he
have
leave
it
;
and
,
Augusta
,
I
can
only
beg
you
to
understand
,
that
,
as
far
as
I
be
concern
,
there
be
nothing
which
may
not
be
tell
to
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
,
so
say
,
she
walk
on
a
little
in
advance
of
them
,
as
proud
as
a
queen
.
<EOS>
have
Lady
de
Courcy
herself
meet
her
at
this
moment
,
she
would
almost
have
feel
herself
force
to
shrink
out
of
the
pathway
.
<EOS>
"
not
say
a
word
of
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
repeat
to
herself
,
but
still
out
loud
.
"
<EOS>
no
word
nee
be
leave
unsaid
on
my
account
;
none
,
none
.
"
  
<EOS>
Augusta
follow
her
,
dumfounde
at
her
indignation
;
and
Frank
also
follow
,
but
not
in
silence
.
<EOS>
when
his
first
surprise
at
Mary
's
great
anger
be
over
,
he
feel
himself
call
upon
to
say
some
word
that
may
tend
to
exonerate
his
lady
-
love
;
and
some
word
also
of
protestation
as
to
his
own
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
to
be
tell
,
nothing
,
at
least
of
Mary
,
"
he
say
,
speak
to
his
sister
;
"
but
of
me
,
you
may
tell
this
,
if
you
choose
to
disoblige
your
brother
 
that
I
love
Mary
Thorne
with
all
my
heart
;
and
that
I
will
never
love
any
one
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
they
have
reach
the
lawn
,
and
Mary
be
able
to
turn
away
from
the
path
which
lead
up
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
as
she
leave
them
she
say
in
a
voice
,
now
low
enough
,
"
I
can
not
prevent
him
from
talk
nonsense
,
Augusta
;
but
you
will
bear
me
witness
,
that
I
do
not
willingly
hear
it
.
"
<EOS>
and
,
so
say
,
she
start
off
almost
in
a
run
towards
the
distant
part
of
the
garden
,
in
which
she
see
Beatrice
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
,
as
he
walk
up
to
the
house
with
his
sister
,
endeavour
to
induce
her
to
give
him
a
promise
that
she
would
tell
no
tale
as
to
what
she
have
hear
and
see
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
Frank
,
it
must
be
all
nonsense
,
"
she
have
say
;
"
and
you
should
not
amuse
yourself
in
such
a
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
,
Guss
,
come
,
we
have
always
be
friend
;
do
not
let
us
quarrel
just
when
you
be
go
to
be
marry
.
"
<EOS>
but
Augusta
would
make
no
promise
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
,
when
he
reach
the
house
,
find
the
countess
waiting
for
him
,
sit
in
the
little
drawing
-
room
by
herself
,
 
somewhat
impatiently
.
<EOS>
as
he
enter
he
become
aware
that
there
be
some
peculiar
gravity
attach
to
the
coming
interview
.
<EOS>
three
person
,
his
mother
,
one
of
his
young
sister
,
and
the
Lady
Amelia
,
each
stop
him
to
let
him
know
that
the
countess
be
wait
;
and
he
perceive
that
a
sort
of
guard
be
keep
upon
the
door
to
save
her
ladyship
from
any
undesirable
intrusion
.
  
<EOS>
the
countess
frown
at
the
moment
of
his
entrance
,
but
soon
smooth
her
brow
,
and
invite
him
to
take
a
chair
ready
prepare
for
him
opposite
to
the
elbow
of
the
sofa
on
which
she
be
lean
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
small
table
before
her
,
on
which
be
her
teacup
,
so
that
she
be
able
to
preach
at
him
nearly
as
well
as
though
she
have
be
ensconce
in
a
pulpit
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Frank
,
"
say
she
,
in
a
voice
thoroughly
suitable
to
the
importance
of
the
communication
,
"
you
have
to
-
day
come
of
age
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
remark
that
he
understand
that
such
be
the
case
,
and
add
that
"
that
be
the
reason
for
all
the
fuss
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
you
have
to
-
day
come
of
age
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
should
have
be
glad
to
see
such
an
occasion
notice
at
Greshamsbury
with
some
more
suitable
sign
of
rejoice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
aunt
!
<EOS>
I
think
we
do
it
all
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Greshamsbury
,
Frank
,
be
,
or
at
any
rate
ought
to
be
,
the
seat
of
the
first
commoner
in
Barsetshire
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
;
so
it
be
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
sure
there
be
not
a
well
fellow
than
father
anywhere
in
the
county
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
countess
sigh
.
<EOS>
Her
opinion
of
the
poor
squire
be
very
different
from
Frank
's
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
no
use
now
,
"
say
she
,
"
look
back
to
that
which
can
not
be
cure
.
<EOS>
the
first
commoner
in
Barsetshire
should
hold
a
position
 
I
will
not
of
course
say
equal
to
that
of

peer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
<EOS>
no
;
of
course
not
,
"
say
Frank
;
and
a
bystander
may
have
think
that
there
be
a
touch
of
satire
in
his
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
not
equal
to

for
Lord

career

not

Frank

<EOS>
"
no

Frank
;
by
no

<EOS>
I
do
not
wish
to

a

against
your

<EOS>
It
may
,
perhaps
have
be
his
misfortune

rather
than
his
fault

"
She
be
always

bravely

there
be
the
fact

Frank

too
plain
to
us

<EOS>
"
You
have

one
line
of
conduct
leave
you

your

be
a
good
one

unfortunately
so

just
at

hard
at
six

to

<EOS>
"
You
can

I
must
beg

thirty

who
look
upon

an

"
I
dare

about

very
different

<EOS>
"
thirty

Frank
out
loud

"
It

almost
angrily

when

vital
importance

objection

weight
should
not

into

if

up

Parliament

as
have

twenty

eight

thirty

She

get
money

"
  
<EOS>
Frank
be
astonish
at
his
aunt
's
eloquence
;
but
,
in
spite
of
that
eloquence
,
he
make
up
his
mind
that
he
would
not
marry
Miss
Dunstable
.
<EOS>
how
could
he
,
indeed
,
see
that
his
troth
be
already
plight
to
Mary
Thorne
in
the
presence
of
his
sister
?
<EOS>
this
circumstance
,
however
,
he
do
not
choose
to
plead
to
his
aunt
,
so
he
recapitulate
any
other
objection
that
present
themselves
to
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
he
be
so
anxious
about
his
degree
that
he
could
not
think
of
marry
at
present
;
then
he
suggest
that
it
may
be
well
to
postpone
the
question
till
the
season
's
hunting
should
be
over
;
he
declare
that
he
could
not
visit
Courcy
Castle
till
he
get
a
new
suit
of
clothe
home
from
the
tailor
;
and
ultimately
remember
that
he
have
a
particular
engagement
to
go
fly
-
fish
with
Mr
Oriel
on
that
day
week
.
  
<EOS>
none
,
however
,
of
these
valid
reason
be
sufficiently
potent
to
turn
the

from
her
point

<EOS>
"
Nonsense

Frank

Enough

be
his
moment
of
peculiar
inspiration
 
his
divine
frenzy
,
in
which
he
communicate
most
closely
with
those
deity
who
preside
over
trade
transaction
;
his
eleusinian
mystery
,
to
approach
him
in
which
be
permit
only
to
a
few
of
the
most
favoured
.
  
<EOS>
"
Scatcherd
have
be
drunk
this
week
past
,
"
they
would
say
one
to
another
,
when
the
moment
come
at
which
it
be
to
be
decide
whose
offer
should
be
accept
for
construct
a
harbour
to
hold
all
the
commerce
of
Lancashire
,
or
to
make
a
railway
from
Bombay
to
Canton
.
<EOS>
"
Scatcherd
have
be
drunk
this
week
past
;
I
be
tell
that
he
have
take
over
three
gallon
of
brandy
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
they
feel
sure
that
none
but
Scatcherd
would
be
call
upon
to
construct
the
dock
or
make
the
railway
.
  
<EOS>
but
be
this
as
it
may
,
be
it
true
or
false
that
Sir
Roger
be
most
efficacious
when
in
his
cup
,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
could
not
wallow
for
a
week
in
brandy
,
six
or
seven
time
every
year
,
without
in
a
great
measure
injure
,
and
permanently
injure
,
the
outward
man
.
<EOS>
whatever
immediate
effect
such
symposium
may
have
on
the
inner
mind
 
symposium
indeed
they
be
not
;
posium
I
will
call
them
,
if
I
may
be
allow
;
for
in
latter
life
,
when
he
drink
heavily
,
he
drink
alone
 
however
little
for
evil
,
or
however
much
for
good
the
working
of
his
brain
may
be
affect
,
his
body
suffer
greatly
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
he
become
feeble
or
emaciated
,
old
-
looking
or
inactive
,
that
his
hand
shake
,
or
that
his
eye
be
watery
;
but
that
in
the
moment
of
his
intemperance
<EOS>
his
life
be
often
not
worth
a
day
's
purchase
.
<EOS>
the
frame
which
God
have
give
to
him
be
powerful
beyond
the
power
of
ordinary
man
;
powerful
to
act
in
spite
of
these
violent
perturbation
;
powerful
to
repress
and
conquer
the
qualm
and
headache
and
inward
sickness
to
which
the
votary
of
Bacchus
be
ordinarily
subject
;
but
this
power
be
not
without
its
limit
.
<EOS>
if
encroach
on
too
far
,
it
would
break
and
fall
and
come
asunder
,
and
then
the
strong
man
would
at
once
become
a
corpse
.
  
<EOS>
Scatcherd
have
but
one
friend
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
this
friend
be
no
friend
in
the
ordinary
acceptance
of
the
word
.
<EOS>
He
neither
eat
with
him
nor
drink
with
him
,
nor
even
frequently
talk
with
him
.
<EOS>
Their
pursuit
in
life
be
wide
asunder
.
<EOS>
Their
taste
be
all
different
.
<EOS>
the
society
in
which
each
move
very
seldom
come
together
.
<EOS>
Scatcherd
have
nothing
in
unison
with
this
solitary
friend
;
but
he
trust
him
,
and
he
trust
no
other
live
creature
on
God
's
earth
.
  
<EOS>
He
trust
this
man
;
but
even
him
he
do
not
trust
thoroughly
;
not
at
least
as
one
friend
should
trust
another
.
<EOS>
He
believe
that
this
man
would
not
rob
him
;
would
probably
not
lie
to
him
;
would
not
endeavour
to
make
money
of
him
;
would
not
count
him
up
or
speculate
on
him
,
and
make
out
a
balance
of
profit
and
loss
;
and
,
therefore
,
he
determine
to
use
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
put
no
trust
<EOS>
whatever
in
his
friend
's
counsel
,
in
his
mode
of
thought
;
none
in
his
theory
,
and
none
in
his
practice
.
<EOS>
He
dislike
his
friend
's
counsel
,
and
,
in
fact
,
dislike
his
society
,
for
his
friend
be
somewhat
apt
to
speak
to
him
in
a
manner
approach
to
severity
.
<EOS>
now
Roger
Scatcherd
have
do
many
thing
in
the
world
,
and
make
much
money
;
whereas
his
friend
have
do
but
few
thing
,
and
make
no
money
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
endure
that
the
practical
,
efficient
man
should
be
take
to
task
by
the
man
who
prove
himself
to
be
neither
practical
nor
efficient
;
not
to
be
endure
,
certainly
,
by
Roger
Scatcherd
,
who
look
on
man
of
his
own
class
as
the
man
of
the
day
,
and
on
himself
as
by
no
means
the
least
among
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
friend
be
our
friend
Dr
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
's
first
acquaintance
with
Scatcherd
have
be
already
explain
.
<EOS>
He
be
necessarily
throw
into
communication
with
the
man
at
the
time
of
the
trial
,
and
Scatcherd
then
have
not
only
sufficient
sense
,
but
sufficient
feeling
also
to
know
that
the
doctor
behave
very
well
.
<EOS>
this
communication
have
in
different
way
be
keep
up
between
them
.
<EOS>
soon
after
the
trial
Scatcherd
have
begin
to
rise
,
and
his
first
saving
have
be
entrust
to
the
doctor
's
care
.
<EOS>
this
have
be
the
beginning
of
a
pecuniary
connexion
which
have
never
wholly
cease
,
and
which
have
lead
to
the
purchase
of
Boxall
Hill
,
and
to
the
loan
of
large
sum
of
money
to
the
squire
.
  
<EOS>
in
another
way
also
there
have
be
a
close
alliance
between
them
,
and
one
not
always
of
a
very
pleasant
description
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
be
,
and
long
have
be
,
Sir
Roger
's
medical
attendant
,
and
,
in
his
unceasing
attempt
to
rescue
the
drunkard
from
the
fate
which
be
so
much
to
be
dread
,
he
not
unfrequently
be
drive
into
a
quarrel
with
his
patient
.
  
<EOS>
one
thing
further
must
be
tell
of
Sir
Roger
.
<EOS>
in
politic
he
be
as
violent
a
Radical
as
ever
,
and
be
very
anxious
to
obtain
a
position
in
which
he
could
bring
his
violence
to
bear
.
<EOS>
with
this
view
he
be
about
to
contest
his
native
borough
of
Barchester
,
in
the
hope
of
be
return
in
opposition
to
the
de
Courcy
candidate
;
and
with
this
object
he
have
now
come
down
to
Boxall
Hill
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
his
claim
to
sit
for
Barchester
such
as
could
be
despise
.
<EOS>
if
money
be
to
be
of
avail
,
he
have
plenty
of
it
,
and
be
prepared
to
spend
it
;
whereas
,
rumour
say
that
Mr
Moffat
be
equally
determined
to
do
nothing
so
foolish
.
<EOS>
then
again
,
Sir
Roger
have
a
sort
of
rough
eloquence
,
and
be
able
to
address
the
man
of
Barchester
in
language
that
would
come
home
to
their
heart
,
in
word
that
would
endear
him
to
one
party
while
they
make
him
offensively
odious
to
the
other
;
but
Mr
Moffat
could
make
neither
friend
nor
enemy
by
his
eloquence
.
<EOS>
the
Barchester
rough
call
him
a
dumb
dog
that
could
not
bark
,
and
sometimes
sarcastically
add
that
neither
could
he
bite
.
<EOS>
the
de
Courcy
interest
,
however
,
be
at
his
back
,
and
he
have
also
the
advantage
of
possession
.
<EOS>
Sir
Roger
,
therefore
,
know
that
the
battle
be
not
to
be
win
without
a
struggle
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
get
safely
back
from
Silverbridge
that
evening
,
and
find
Mary
wait
to
give
him
his
tea
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
call
there
to
a
consultation
with
Dr
Century
,
that
amiable
old
gentleman
have
so
far
fall
away
from
the
high
fillgrave
tenet
as
to
consent
to
the
occasional
endurance
of
such
degradation
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
he
breakfast
early
,
and
,
have
mount
his
strong
iron
-
grey
cob
,
start
for
Boxall
Hill
.
<EOS>
not
only
have
he
there
to
negotiate
the
squire
's
further
loan
,
but
also
to
exercise
his
medical
skill
.
<EOS>
Sir
Roger
have
be
declare
contractor
for
cut
a
canal
from
sea
to
sea
,
through
the
Isthmus
of
Panama
,
have
be
make
a
week
of
it
;
and
the
result
be
that
Lady
Scatcherd
have
write
rather
peremptorily
to
her
husband
's
medical
friend
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
consequently
trot
off
to
Boxall
Hill
on
his
iron
-
grey
cob
.
<EOS>
among
his
other
merit
be
that
of
be
a
good
horseman
,
and
he
do
much
of
his
work
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
the
fact
that
he
occasionally
take
a
day
with
the
East
Barsetshires
,
and
that
when
he
do
so
he
thoroughly
enjoy
it
,
have
probably
not
fail
to
add
something
to
the
strength
of
the
squire
's
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
lady
,
how
be
he
?
<EOS>
not
much
the
matter
<EOS>
,
I
hope
?
"
say
the
doctor
,
as
he
shake
hand
with
the
title
mistress
of
Boxall
Hill
in
a
small
breakfast
-
parlour
in
the
rear
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
the
show
-
room
of
Boxall
Hill
be
furnish
most
magnificently
,
but
they
be
set
apart
for
company
;
and
as
the
company
never
come
 
see
that
they
be
never
invite
 
the
grand
room
and
the
grand
furniture
be
not
of
much
material
use
to
Lady
Scatcherd
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
then
,
doctor
,
he
be
just
bad
enough
,
"
say
her
ladyship
,
not
in
a
very
happy
tone
of
voice
;
"
just
bad
enough
.
<EOS>
there
be
be
some'at
at
the
back
of
his
head
,
rapping
,
and
rapping
,
and
rapping
;
and
if
you
do
not
do
something
,
I
be
think
it
will
rap
him
too
hard
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
he
in
bed
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
yes
,
he
be
in
bed
;
for
when
he
be
first
take
he
could
not
very
well
help
hisself
,
so
we
put
him
to
bed
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
he
do
not
seem
to
be
quite
right
yet
about
the
leg
,
so
he
have
not
get
up
;
but
he
be
get
that
Winterbones
with
him
to
write
for
him
,
and
when
Winterbones
be
there
,
Scatcherd
may
as
well
be
up
for
any
good
<EOS>
that
bed'll
do
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Winterbones
be
confidential
clerk
to
Sir
Roger
.
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
,
he
be
a
writing
-
machine
of
which
Sir
Roger
make
use
to
do
certain
work
which
could
not
well
be
adjust
without
some
contrivance
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
little
,
withered
,
dissipate
,
break
-
down
man
,
whom
gin
and
poverty
have
nearly
burn
to
a
cinder
,
and
dry
to
an
ash
.
<EOS>
mind
<EOS>
he
have
none
leave
,
nor
care
for
earthly
thing
,
except
the
small
modicum
of
substantial
food
,
and
the
large
allowance
of
liquid
sustenance
.
<EOS>
all
that
he
have
ever
know
he
have
forget
,
except
how
to
count
up
figure
and
to
write
:
the
result
of
his
counting
and
his
writing
never
stay
with
him
from
one
hour
to
another
;
nay
,
not
from
one
folio
to
another
.
<EOS>
let
him
,
however
,
be
adequately
screw
up
with
gin
,
and
adequately
screw
down
by
the
presence
of
his
master
,
and
then
no
amount
of
counting
and
writing
would
be
too
much
for
him
.
<EOS>
this
be
Mr
Winterbones
,
confidential
clerk
to
the
great
Sir
Roger
Scatcherd
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
send
Winterbones
away
<EOS>
,
I
take
it
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
doctor
,
I
wish
you
would
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
send
him
to
Bath
,
or
anywhere
else
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
there
be
Scatcherd
,
he
take
brandy
;
and
there
be
Winterbones
,
he
take
gin
;
and
it
would
puzzle
a
woman
to
say
which
be
bad
,
master
or
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
will
seem
from
this
,
that
Lady
Scatcherd
and
the
doctor
be
on
very
familiar
term
as
regard
her
little
domestic
inconvenience
.
  
<EOS>
"
tell
Sir
Roger
I
be
here
,
will
you
?
"
say
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
take
a
drop
of
sherry
before
you
go
up

say
the
lady

<EOS>
"
not
a
drop

you

the

perhaps

a

"
just
a
thimbleful

this

"
say
the
lady
,
produce
from
some
recess
under
a
sideboard
a
bottle
of
brandy
;

just
a
thimbleful
?
<EOS>
It
be
what
he
take
himself

"
  
<EOS>
when
Lady
Scatcherd
find
that
even
this
argument
fail
,
she
lead
the
way
to
the
great
man
's
bedroom

well

the
greeting
with
which
our
son
of
Galen
be
salute
some
time
before
he
enter
the
sick

room

His
approach
step
be
hear
,
and
thus
the

mason
salute
his
come
friend

<EOS>
the
voice
be
loud

powerful

not
clear
and
sonorous
.
<EOS>
what
voice
that
be
nurture
on
brandy
can
ever
be
clear
?
<EOS>
It
have
about
it
a
peculiar
huskiness
,
a
dissipate
guttural
tone
,
which
Thorne
immediately
recognise
,
and
recognise
as
be
more
marked
,
more
guttural
,
and
more
husky
than
heretofore

so
you
have

me
out

have
you

to
deposit
surreptitiously

she
give

thorough
distrust

the
other

which
she
contrive
to
throw
into
those
few
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what

doctor
;
I
will
not
let
the
messenger
go
.
<EOS>
I
will
bear
the
brunt
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
do
much
now
<EOS>
he
be
not
up

you
know

<EOS>
I
will
stop
the
boy
;
we
will
not
have
no
Fillgraves
here

"
  
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
a
step
to
which
Dr
Thorne
would
not
assent
.
<EOS>
He
endeavour
to
explain
to
the
anxious
wife
,
that
after
what
have
pass
he
could
not
tender
his
medical
service
till
they
be
again
ask
for
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
can
slip
in
as
a
friend
,
you
know
;
and
then
by
degree
you
can
come
round
him
,
eh
?
<EOS>
can
not
you
now
,
doctor
?
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
payment
 
"
  
all
that
Dr
Thorne
say
on
the
subject
may
easily
be
imagine
.
<EOS>
and
in
this
way
,
and
in
partaking
of
the
lunch
which
be
force
upon
him
,
an
hour
have
nearly
pass
between
his
leave
Sir
Roger
's
bedroom
and
put
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
.
<EOS>
but
no
sooner
have
the
cob
begin
to
move
on
the
gravel
-
sweep
before
the
house
,
than
one
of
the
upper
window
open
,
and
the
doctor
be
summon
to
another
conference
with
the
sick
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
say
you
be
to
come
back
,
whether
or
no
,
"
say
Mr
Winterbones
,
screech
out
of
the
window
,
and
put
all
his
emphasis
on
the
last
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thorne
!
<EOS>
Thorne
!
<EOS>
Thorne
!
"
shout
the
sick
man
from
his
sick
-
bed
,
so
loudly
that
the
doctor
hear
him
,
seat
as
he
be
on
horseback
out
before
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
to
come
back
,
whether
or
no
,
"
repeat
Winterbones
,
with
more
emphasis
,
evidently
conceive
that
there
be
a
strength
of
injunction
in
that
"
whether
or
no
"
which
would
be
find
quite
invincible
.
  
<EOS>
whether
actuate
by
these
magic
word
,
or
by
some
internal
process
of
thought
,
we
will
not
say
;
but
the
doctor
do
slowly
,
and
as
though
unwillingly
,
dismount
again
from
his
steed
,
and
slowly
retrace
his
step
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
no
use
,
"
he
say
to
himself
,
"
for
that
messenger
have
already
go
to
Barchester
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
send
for
Dr
Fillgrave
,
"
be
the
first
word
which
the
contractor
say
to
him
when
he
again
find
himself
by
the
bedside
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
call
me
back
to
tell
me
that
?
"
say
Thorne
,
who
now
realy
feel
angry
at
the
impertinent
petulance
of
the
man
before
him
:
"
you
should
consider
,
Scatcherd
,
that
my
time
may
be
of
value
to
other
,
if
not
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
now
do
not
be
angry
,
old
fellow
,
"
say
Scatcherd
,
<EOS>
turn
to
him
,
and
look
at
him
with
a
countenance
quite
different
from
any
that
he
have
show
that
day
;
a
countenance
in
which
there
be
a
show
of
manhood
,
 
some
show
also
of
affection
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
angry
now
because
I
have
send
for
Fillgrave
?
"
  
"
not
in
the
least
,
"
say
the
doctor
very
complacently
.
<EOS>
"
not
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
fillgrave
will
do
as
much
good
as
I
can
do
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
that
be
none
at
all
,
I
suppose
;
eh
,
Thorne
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
depend
on
yourself
.
<EOS>
He
will
do
you
good
if
you
will
tell
him
the
truth
,
and
will
then
be
guide
by
him
.
<EOS>
Your
wife
,
your
servant
,
any
one
can
be
as
good
a
doctor
to
you
as
either
he
or
I
;
as
good
,
that
is
,
in
the
main
point
.
<EOS>
but
you
have
send
for
Fillgrave
now
;
and
of
course
you
must
see
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
much
to
do
,
and
you
must
let
me
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Scatcherd
,
however
,
would
not
let
him
go
,
but
hold
his
hand
fast
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thorne
,
"
say
he
,
"
if
you
like
it
,
I
will
make
them
put
Fillgrave
under
the
pump
<EOS>
directly
he
come
here
.
<EOS>
I
will
indeed
,
and
pay
all
the
damage
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
another
proposition
to
which
the
doctor
could
not
consent
;
but
he
be
utterly
unable
to
refrain
from
laugh
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
earnest
look
of
entreaty
about
Sir
Roger
's
face
as
he
make
the
suggestion
;
and
,
join
to
this
,
there
be
a
gleam
of
comic
satisfaction
in
his
eye
which
seem
to
promise
,
that
if
he
receive
the
least
encouragement
he
would
put
his
threat
into
execution
.
<EOS>
now
our
doctor
be
not
inclined
to
take
any
step
towards
subject
his
learn
brother
to
pump
discipline
;
but
he
could
not
but
admit
to
himself
that
the
idea
be
not
a
bad
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
have
it
do
,
I
will
,
by
heaven
!
<EOS>
if
you
will
only
say
the
word
,
"
protest
Sir
Roger
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
doctor
do
not
say
the
word
,
and
so
the
idea
be
pass
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
not
be
so
testy
with
a
man
when
he
be
ill
,
"
say
Scatcherd
,
still
hold
the
doctor
's
hand
,
of
which
he
have
again
get
possession
;
"
specially
not
an
old
friend
;
and
specially
again
when
you
be
be
a
-
blowing
of
him
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
worth
the
doctor
's
while
to
aver
that
the
testiness
have
all
be
on
the
other
side
,
and
that
he
have
never
lose
his
good
-
humour
;
so
he
merely
smile
,
and
ask
Sir
Roger
if
he
could
do
anything
further
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
you
can
,
doctor
;
and
that
be
why
I
send
for
you
,
 
why
I
send
for
you
yesterday
.
<EOS>
get
out
of
the
room
,
Winterbones
,
"
he
then
say
,
gruffly
,
as
though
he
be
dismissing
from
his
chamber
a
dirty
dog
.
<EOS>
winterbone
,
not
a
whit
offend
,
again
hide
his
cup
under
his
coat
-
tail
and
vanish
.
  
<EOS>
"
sit
down
,
Thorne
,
sit
down
,
"
say
the
contractor
,
speak
quite
in
a
different
manner
from
any
that
he
have
yet
assume
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
be
in
a
hurry
,
but
you
must
give
me
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
I
may
be
dead
before
you
can
give
me
another
;
who
know

"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
of
course
declare
that
he
hope
to
have
many
a
half
-
hour
's
chat
with
him
for
many
a
year
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
that
be
as
may
be
.
<EOS>
You
must
stop
now
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
You
can
make
the
cob
pay
for
it
,
you
know

"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
take
a
chair
and
sit
down
.
<EOS>
thus
entreat
to
stop
,
he
have
hardly
any
alternative
but
to
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
because
I
be
ill
that
I
send
for
you

or
rather
let
her
ladyship
send
for
you
.
<EOS>
Lord
bless
you

Thorne

do
you
think
I
do
not

it
be

make
me
like

when
I
see

kill
himself
with
gin

you
think

"
<EOS>
and
the
doctor
prepare
to
pour
out
the
flood
of
his
eloquence
in
beseech
this
singular
man
to
abstain
from
his
well

through

nothing
leave

the

of
course

in
hear
all
this

say
something
of
a
tendency
to
comfort

console
the
mind
of
his
patient

<EOS>
not
that
anything
he
could
say
would
comfort

console
the
man

that
it
be
impossible

sit
there

hear
such
fearful
truth

be
truth

answer

this

explain
away
what
he

as
well
as
he

<EOS>
He
could
not
explain
that
what
he
have
really
mean
be
this
,
that
Sir
Roger
Scatcherd
's
son
be
not
a
man
fit
to
be
trust
with
the
entire
control
of
an
enormous

<EOS>
Sir
Roger
Scatcherd
have
but
one
child

that

which
have
be
bear
in

<EOS>
the
boy
have
grow
up

have
become
strong
neither

His

have
determine

to

even
this
receipt
,
generally
as
it
be
recognise
,
will
not
make
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
It
be
hard
,
indeed
,
to
define
what
receipt
will
do
so
,
though
people
do
have
in
their
own
mind
some
certain
undefined
,

yet
tolerably
correct
idea
on
the
subject

<EOS>
be
that

may
,
two
year
at

three
term
at
Cambridge

not

<EOS>
yes
;
he
be
christen
Louis
Philippe
,
after
the
King
of

French

look
out
in

to
find
child
who
have
be
christen
after
king
and
queen
,
or
the
uncle

aunt
of
king

queen
,
the
search
should
be
make
in
the
family
of
democrat
.
<EOS>
none
have
so
servile
a
deference
for
the
very
nail
-
paring
of
royalty
;
none
feel
so
wonder
an
awe
at
the
exaltation
of
a
crown
head
;
none
be
so
anxious
to
secure
themselves
some
shred
or
fragment
that
have
be
consecrate
by
the
royal
touch

<EOS>
It
be
the
distance
which
they
feel
to
exist
between
themselves

the
throne
which
make
them
covet
the
crumb
of
majesty
,
the
odd
and
end

chance
splinter
of
royalty

<EOS>
there
be
nothing
royal
about
Louis

Scatcherd

his
name
.
<EOS>
He
have
now
come
to
man
's
estate
,
and
his
father
,
find
the
Cambridge
receipt
to
be
inefficacious
,
have
send
him
abroad
to
travel
with
a
tutor
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
have
from
time
to
time
hear
tiding
of
this
youth
;
he
know
that
he
have
already
show
symptom
of
his
father
's
vice
,
but
no
symptom
of
his
father
's
talent
;
he
know
that
he
have
begin
life
by
be
dissipate
,
without
be
generous
;
and
that
at
the
age
of
twenty
-
one
he
have
already
suffer
from
delirium
tremen
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
on
this
account
that
he
have
express
disapprobation
,
rather
than
surprise
,
when
he
hear
that
his
father
intend
to
bequeath
the
bulk
of
his
large
fortune
to
the
uncontrolled
will
of
this
unfortunate
boy
.
  
<EOS>

satisfaction
can
it
give
me
?

<EOS>
the

assure
him
that
he
do
not
at
all
mean
to
dispute
this

<EOS>
"

will
do
well

now
the
fact
be

that
Sir

Scatcherd
feel
in
his
heart
no
special
love
for
young
Gresham

with
her
ladyship
it
may
almost
be
a
question
whether
she
do
not
love
the
youth
whom
she
have
nurse
almost
as
well
as
that
other
one
who
be
her
own

on

to

rest
his

gaze

at

he
give

<EOS>
I
must
think
if
over
;
I
must
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
give
yourself
the
least
trouble
in
the
world
about
my
will
till
I
be
dead
;
not
the
least
.
<EOS>
and
who
know
 
maybe
,
I
may
be
settle
your
affair
yet
;
eh
,
doctor
?
<EOS>
look
after
your
niece
when
you
be
dead
and
go
,
and
get
a
husband
for
her
,
eh
?
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
,
without
further
speech
,
the
doctor
go
his
way
.
   
<EOS>
the
Doctor
drink
His
tea
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
get
on
his
cob
and
go
his
way
,
return
duly
to
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
truth
,
as
he
go
he
hardly
know
whither
he
be
go
,
or
what
he
be
do
.
<EOS>
Sir
Roger
have
hint
that
the
cob
would
be
compel
to
make
up
for
lose
time
by
extra
exertion
on
the
road
;
but
the
cob
have
never
be
permit
to
have
his
own
way
as
to
pace
more
satisfactorily
than
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
indeed
,
hardly
know
that
he
be
on
horseback
,
so
completely
be
he
envelop
in
the
cloud
of
his
own
thought
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
that
alternative
which
it
have
become
him
to
put
before
the
baronet
as
one
unlikely
to
occur
 
that
of
the
speedy
death
of
both
father
and
son
 
be
one
which
he
feel
in
his
heart
of
heart
may
very
probably
come
to
pass
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
chance
be
ten
to
one
that
such
a
clause
will
never
be
bring
to
bear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
he
have
say
partly
to
himself
,
so
as
to
ease
the
thought
which
come
crowd
on
his
brain
;
partly
,
also
,
in
pity
for
the
patient
and
the
father
.
<EOS>
but
now
that
he
think
the
matter
over
,
he
feel
that
there
be
no
such
odd
.
<EOS>
be
not
the
odd
the
other
way
?
<EOS>
be
it
not
almost
probable
that
both
these
man
may
be
gather
to
their
long
account
within
the
next
four
year
?
<EOS>
one
,
the
elder
,
be
a
strong
man
,
indeed
;
one
who
may
yet
live
for
year
to
come
if
he
would
but
give
himself
fair
play
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
he
himself
protest
,
and
protest
with
a
truth
too
surely
ground
,
that
fair
play
to
himself
be
beyond
his
own
power
to
give
.
<EOS>
the
other
,
the
young
,
have
everything
against
him
.
<EOS>
not
only
be
he
a
poor
,
puny
creature
,
without
physical
strength
,
one
of
whose
life
a
friend
could
never
feel
sure
under
any
circumstance
,
but
he
also
be
already
addict
to
his
father
's
vice
;
he
also
be
already
kill
himself
with
alcohol
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
,
if
these
two
man
do
die
within
the
prescribed
period
,
if
this
clause
in
Sir
Roger
's
will
be
bring
to
bear
,
if
it
should
become
his
,
Dr
Thorne
's
,
duty
to
see
that
clause
carry
out
,
how
would
he
be
bind
to
act
?
<EOS>
that
woman
's
eld
child
be
his
own
niece
,
his
adopt
bairn
,
his
darling
,
the
pride
of
his
heart
,
the
cynosure
of
his
eye
,
his
child
also
,
his
own
Mary
.
<EOS>
of
all
his
duty
on
this
earth
,
next
to
that
one
great
duty
to
his
God
and
conscience
,
be
his
duty
to
her
.
<EOS>
what
,
under
these
circumstance
,
do
his
duty
to
her
require
of
him
?
  
<EOS>
but
then
,
that
one
great
duty
,
that
duty
which
she
would
be
the
first
to
expect
from
him
;
what
do
that
demand
of
him
?
<EOS>
have
Scatcherd
make
his
will
without
say
what
its
clause
be
,
it
seem
to
Thorne
that
Mary
must
have
be
the
heiress
,
should
that
clause
become
necessarily
operative
.
<EOS>
whether
she
be
so
or
not
would
at
any
rate
be
for
lawyer
to
decide
.
<EOS>
but
now
the
case
be
very
different
.
<EOS>
this
rich
man
have
confide
in
him
,
and
would
it
not
be
a
breach
of
confidence
,
an
act
of
absolute
dishonesty
 
<EOS>
an
act
of
dishonesty
both
to
Scatcherd
and
to
that
far
-
distant
american
family
,
to
that
father
,
who
,
in
former
day
,
have
behave
so
nobly
,
and
to
that
eld
child
of
his
,
would
it
not
be
gross
dishonesty
to
them
all
if
he
allow
this
man
to
leave
a
will
by
which
his
property
may
go
to
a
person
never
intend
to
be
his
heir
?
  
<EOS>
long
before
he
have
arrive
at
Greshamsbury
his
mind
on
this
point
have
be
make
up
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
have
be
make
up
while
sit
there
by
Scatcherd
's
bedside
.
<EOS>
It
have
not
be
difficult
to
make
up
his
mind
to
so
much
;
but
then
,
his
way
out
of
this
dishonesty
be
not
so
easy
for
him
to
find
.
<EOS>
how
should
he
set
this
matter
right
so
as
to
inflict
no
injury
on
his
niece
,
and
no
sorrow
to
himself
 
if
that
indeed
could
be
avoid
?
  
<EOS>
and
then
other
thought
crowd
on
his
brain
.
<EOS>
He
have
always
profess
 
profess
at
any
rate
to
himself
and
to
her
 
that
of
all
the
vile
object
of
a
man
's
ambition
,
wealth
,
wealth
merely
for
its
own
sake
,
be
the
vilest
.
<EOS>
They
,
in
their
joint
school
of
inherent
philosophy
,
have
progress
to
idea
which
they
may
find
it
not
easy
to
carry
out
,
should
they
be
call
on
by
event
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
and
if
this
would
have
be
difficult
to
either
when
act
on
behalf
of
self
alone
,
how
much
more
difficult
when
one
may
have
to
act
for
the
other
!
<EOS>
this
difficulty
have
now
come
to
the
uncle
.
<EOS>
Should
he
,
in
this
emergency
,
take
upon
himself
to
fling
away
the
golden
chance
which
may
accrue
to
his
niece
if
Scatcherd
should
be
encourage
to
make
her
partly
his
heir
?
  
<EOS>
"
He
would
want
her
to
go
and
live
there
 
to
live
with
him
and
his
wife
.
<EOS>
all
the
money
in
the
Bank
of
England
would
not
pay
her
for
such
misery
,
"
say
the
doctor
to
himself
,
as
he
slowly
ride
into
be
own
yard
.
  
<EOS>
on
one
point
,
and
one
only
,
have
he
definitely
make
up
his
mind
.
<EOS>
on
the
follow
day
he
would
go
over
again
to
Boxall
Hill
,
and
would
tell
Scatcherd
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
come
what
may
,
the
truth
must
be
the
good
.
<EOS>
and
so
,
with
some
gleam
of
comfort
,
he
go
into
the
house
,
and
find
his
niece
in
the
drawing
-
room
with
Patience
Oriel
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
and
I
have
be
quarrel
,
"
say
Patience
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
say
the
doctor
be
the
great
man
in
a
village
;
and
I
say
the
parson
be
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
say
that
the
doctor
be
the
most
look
after
,
"
say
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
another
horrid
message
for
you
to
go
to
Silverbridge
,
uncle
.
<EOS>
why
can
not
that
Dr
Century
manage
his
own
people
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
say
,
"
continue
Miss
Oriel
,
"
that
if
a
parson
be
away
for
a
month
,
no
one
would
miss
him
;
but
that
a
doctor
be
so
precious
that
his
very
minute
be
count
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
uncle
's
be
.
<EOS>
They
begrudge
him
his
meal
.
<EOS>
Mr
Oriel
never
get
call
away
to
Silverbridge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
we
in
the
Church
manage
our
parish
arrangement
better
than
you
do
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
let
strange
practitioner
in
among
our
flock
because
the
sheep
may
chance
to
fancy
them
.
<EOS>
Our
sheep
have
to
put
up
with
our
spiritual
dose
whether
they
like
them
or
not
.
<EOS>
in
that
respect
we
be
much
the
good
off
.
<EOS>
I
advise
you
,
Mary
,
to
marry
a
clergyman
,
by
all
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
will
when
you
marry
a
doctor
,
"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
nothing
on
earth
would
give
me
great
pleasure
,
"
say
Miss
Oriel
,
get
up
and
curtsey
very
low
to
Dr
Thorne
;
"
but
I
be
not
quite
prepared
for
the
agitation
of
an
offer
this
morning
,
so
I
will
run
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
she
go
;
and
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
get
on
his
other
horse
,
start
again
for
Silverbridge
,
wearily
enough
.
"
<EOS>
She
be
happy
now
where
she
be
,
"
say
he
to
himself
,
as
he
ride
along
.
<EOS>
"
They
all
treat
her
there
as
an
equal
at
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
what
though
she
be
no
cousin
to
the
Thornes
of
Ullathorne
.
<EOS>
She
have
find
her
place
there
among
them
all
,
and
keep
it
on
equal
term
with
the
good
of
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
Miss
Oriel
;
her
family
be
high
;
she
be
rich
,
fashionable
,
a
beauty
,
court
by
every
one
;
but
yet
she
do
not
look
down
on
Mary
.
<EOS>
They
be
equal
friend
together
.
<EOS>
but
how
would
it
be
if
she
be
take
to
Boxall
Hill
,
even
as
a
recognise
niece
of
the
rich
man
there
?
<EOS>
Would
Patience
Oriel
and
Beatrice
Gresham
go
there
after
her
?
<EOS>
Could
she
be
happy
there
as
she
be
in
my
house
here
,
poor
though
it
be
?
<EOS>
It
would
kill
her
to
pass
a
month
with
Lady
Scatcherd
and
put
up
with
that
man
's
humour
,
to
see
his
mode
of
life
,
to
be
dependent
on
him
,
to
belong
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
the
doctor
,
hurry
on
to
Silverbridge
,
again
meet
Dr
Century
at
the
old
lady
's
bedside
,
and
have
make
his
endeavour
to
stave
off
the
inexorable
coming
of
the
grim
visitor
,
again
return
to
his
own
niece
and
his
own
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
dead
,
uncle
,
"
say
Mary
,
as
she
pour
out
his
tea
for
him
,
and
prepare
the
comfort
of
that
most
comfortable
meal
 
tea
,
dinner
,
and
supper
,
all
in
one
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
Silverbridge
be
fifty
mile
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
would
only
make
the
journey
worse
;
but
I
be
not
dead
yet
,
and
,
what
be
more
to
the
purpose
,
neither
be
my
patient
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
as
he
speak
he
contrive
to
swallow
a
jorum
of
scald
tea
,
contain
in
measure
somewhat
near
a
pint
.
<EOS>
Mary
,
not
a
whit
amazed
at
this
feat
,
merely
refill
the
jorum
without
any
observation
;
and
the
doctor
go
on
stir
the
mixture
with
his
spoon
,
evidently
oblivious
that
any
ceremony
have
be
perform
by
either
of
them
since
the
first
supply
have
be
administer
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
clatter
of
knife
and
fork
be
over
,
the
doctor
turn
himself
to
the
hearthrug
,
and
put
one
leg
over
the
other
,
he
begin
to
nurse
it
as
he
look
with
complacency
at
his
third
cup
of
tea
,
which
stand
untasted
beside
him
.
<EOS>
the
fragment
of
the
solid
banquet
have
be
remove
,
but
no
sacrilegious
hand
have
be
lay
on
the
teapot
and
the
cream
-
jug
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
"
say
he
,
"
suppose
you
be
to
find
out
to
-
morrow
morning
that
,
by
some
accident

you
have
become
a
great
heiress
,
would
you
be
able
to
suppress
your
exultation
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
first
thing
I
would
do
,
would
be
to
pronounce
a
positive
edict
that
you
should
never
go
to
Silverbridge
again
;
at
least
without
a
day
's
notice
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
and
what
next
?
<EOS>
what
would
you
do
next
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
next
thing
 
the
next
thing
would
be
to
send
to
Paris
for
a
french
bonnet
exactly
like
the
one
Patience
Oriel
have
on
.
<EOS>
do
you
see
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
I
can
not
say
I
do
;
bonnet
be
invisible
now
;
besides
I
never
remark
anybody
's
clothe
,
except
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
oh
!
do
look
at
Miss
Oriel
's
bonnet
<EOS>
the
next
time
you
see
her
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
understand
why
it
should
be
so
,
but
I
be
sure
of
this
 
<EOS>
no
english
finger
could
put
together
such
a
bonnet
as
that
;
and
I
be
nearly
sure
that
no
french
finger
could
do
it
in
England
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
do
not
care
so
much
about
bonnet
,
Mary
!
"
<EOS>
this
the
doctor
say
as
an
assertion
;
but
there
be
,
nevertheless
,
somewhat
of
a
question
involve
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
I
,
though
?
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
care
very
much
about
bonnet
;
especially
since
I
see
Patience
this
morning
.
<EOS>
I
ask
how
much
it
cost
 
guess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
I
do
not
know
 
a
pound

a

a

more

ten

oh
,
uncle

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
more
than
ten
pound

<EOS>
then
I
do
not

even
Patience
Oriel
ought
to
give
it
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
no
,
of
course
she
would
not
;

,
uncle

it
really
cost
a
hundred
franc

a

franc

four

mine

myself
to

I
would
take
you
with

to
choose
it

"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
sit
silent
for
a
while
meditate
about
this
,
during
which
he
unconsciously
absorb
the
tea
beside
him

I

we
will
send

You

no

indeed

<EOS>
if
you
know
the
way
to
send

I

confess
would
puzzle
me

I

have
a

give
you
that

You

I

I

those

success

have
in
negotiate

Sir

<EOS>
the
fact
,
however
,
be
,
that
in
his
visit
at
Boxall
Hill
,
the
doctor
have
be
altogether
unable
to
bring
on
the
carpet
the
matter
of
this
loan

<EOS>
subject
have
crowd
themselves
in
too
quickly
during
that
interview
 
those
two
interview
at
Sir

bedside
;
and
he
have
be
oblige
to
leave
without
even
allude
to
the
question

<EOS>
"
I
must
at
any
rate
go
back
now

he
to
himself

<EOS>
so
he
write
to
the
squire

say
that
he
be
to
be
at
Boxall
Hill
again
on
the
follow
day
,

that
he

call
at
the
house
on

to

<EOS>
why

he
be
ill

<EOS>

that
be
an
objection
,
certainly
;
but
some
day
,
when
he
be
well
,
could
not
you
take
me
over
?
<EOS>
I
have
the
great
desire
to
see
a
man
like
that
;
a
man
who
begin
with
nothing
and
now
have
more
than
enough
to
buy
the
whole
parish
of
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

you
would
like
him
at
all

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
not
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
should
;
I
be
sure
I
should
like
him
,
and
Lady
Scatcherd
,
too
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
you
say
that
she
be
an
excellent
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
in
her
way
;
and
he
,
too
,
be
good
in
his
way
;
but
they
be
neither
of
them
in
your
way
:
they
be
extremely
vulgar
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
mind
that
;
that
would
make
them
more
amusing
;
one
do
not
go
to
those
sort
of
people
for
polished
manner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
you
would
find
the
Scatcherds
pleasant
acquaintance
at
all
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
take
his
bed
-
candle
,
and
kiss
his
niece
's
forehead
as
he
leave
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
when
Greek
meet
Greek
,
then
come
the
Tug
of
War
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
that
be
our
doctor
,
have
think
nothing
more
of
the
message
which
have
be
send
to
that
other
doctor
,
Dr
fillgrave
;
nor
in
truth
do
the
baronet
.
<EOS>
Lady
Scatcherd
have
think
of
it
,
but
her
husband
during
the
rest
of
the
day
be
not
in
a
humour
which
allow
her
to
remind
him
that
he
would
soon
have
a
new
physician
on
his
hand
;
so
she
leave
the
difficulty
to
arrange
itself
,
wait
in
some
little
trepidation
till
Dr
Fillgrave
should
show
himself
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
well
that
Sir
Roger
be
not
die
for
want
of
his
assistance
,
for
when
the
message
reach
Barchester
<EOS>
,
Dr
Fillgrave
be
some
five
or
six
mile
out
of
town
,
at
plumstead
;
and
as
he
do
not
get
back
till
late
in
the
evening
,
he
feel
himself
necessitate
to
put
off
his
visit
to
Boxall
Hill
till
next
morning
.
<EOS>
have
he
chance
to
have
be
make
acquaint
with
that
little
conversation
about
the
pump
,
he
would
probably
have
postpone
it
even
yet
a
while
longer
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
,
however
,
by
no
mean
sorry
to
be
summon
to
the
bedside
of
Sir
Roger
Scatcherd
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
know
at
Barchester
,
and
very
well
known
to
Dr
Fillgrave
,
that
Sir
Roger
and
Dr
Thorne
be
old
friend
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
well
known
to
him
also
,
that
Sir
Roger
,
in
all
his
bodily
ailment
,
have
hitherto
be
content
to
entrust
his
safety
to
the
skill
of
his
old
friend
.
<EOS>
Sir
Roger
be
in
his
way
a
great
man
,
and
much
talk
of
in
Barchester
,
and
rumour
have
already
reach
the
ear
of
the
Barchester
Galen
,
that
the
great
railway
contractor
be
ill
.
<EOS>
when
,
therefore
,
he
receive
a
peremptory
summon
to
go
over
to
Boxall
Hill
,
he
could
not
but
think
that
some
pure
light
have
break
in
upon
Sir
Roger
's
darkness
,
and
teach
him
at
last
where
to
look
for
true
medical
accomplishment
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
,
also
,
Sir
Roger
be
the
rich
man
in
the
county
,
and
to
county
practitioner
a
new
patient
with
large
mean
be
a
godsend
;
how
much
great
a
godsend
when
he
be
not
only
acquire
,
but
take
also
from
some
rival
practitioner
<EOS>
,
nee
hardly
be
explain
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Fillgrave
,
therefore
,
be
somewhat
elated
when
,
after
a
very
early
breakfast
,
he
step
into
the
post
-
chaise
which
be
to
carry
him
to
Boxall
Hill
.
<EOS>
Dr
Fillgrave
's
professional
advancement
have
be
sufficient
to
justify
the
establishment
of
a
brougham
,
in
which
he
pay
his
ordinary
visit
round
Barchester
;
but
this
be
a
special
occasion
,
require
special
speed
,
and
about
to
produce
no
doubt
a
special
guerdon
,
and
therefore
a
pair
of
post
-
horse
be
put
into
request
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
yet
nine
when
the
post
-
boy
somewhat
loudly
ring
the
bell
at
Sir
Roger
's
door
;
and
then
Dr
Fillgrave
,
for
the
first
time
,
find
himself
in
the
new
grand
hall
of
Boxall
Hill
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
my
lady
,
"
say
the
servant
,
show
him
into
the
grand
dining
-
room
;
and
there
for
some
fifteen
minute
or
twenty
minute
<EOS>
Dr
Fillgrave
walk
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
Turkey
carpet
all
alone
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Fillgrave
be
not
a
tall
man
,
and
be
perhaps
rather
more
inclined
to
corpulence
than
become
his
height
.
<EOS>
in
his
stocking
-
foot
,
accord
to
the
usually
receive
style
of
measurement
,
he
be
five
foot
five
;
and
he
have
a
little
round
abdominal
protuberance
,
which
an
inch
and
a
half
add
to
the
heel
of
his
boot
hardly
enable
him
to
carry
off
as
well
as
he
himself
would
have
wish
.
<EOS>
of
this
he
be
apparently
conscious
,
and
it
give
to
him
an
air
of
not
be
entirely
at
his
ease
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
however
,
a
personal
dignity
in
his
demeanour
,
a
propriety
in
his
gait
,
and
an
air
of
authority
in
his
gesture
which
should
prohibit
one
from
stigmatize
those
effort
at
altitude
as
a
failure
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
he
do
achieve
much
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
the
effort
would
occasionally
betray
itself
,
and
the
story
of
the
frog
and
the
ox
would
irresistibly
force
itself
into
one
's
mind
at
those
moment
when
it
most
behoved
Dr
fillgrave
to
be
magnificent
.
  
<EOS>
but
if
the
bulgy
roundness
of
his
person
and
the
shortness
of
his
leg
in
any
way
detract
from
his
personal
importance
,
these
trifle
defect
be
,
he
be
well
aware
,
<EOS>
more
than
atone
for
by
the
peculiar
dignity
of
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
if
his
leg
be
short
,
his
face
be
not
;
if
there
be
any
undue
preponderance
below
the
waistcoat
,
all
be
in
due
symmetry
above
the
necktie
.
<EOS>
His
hair
be
grey
,
not
grizzle
nor
white
,
but
properly
grey
;
and
stand
up
straight
from
off
his
temple
on
each
side
with
an
unbend
determination
of
purpose
.
<EOS>
His
whisker
,
which
be
of
an
admirable
shape
,
come
down
and
turn
gracefully
at
the
angle
of
his
jaw
,
be
grey
also
,
but
somewhat
dark
than
his
hair
.
<EOS>
His
enemy
in
Barchester
declare
that
their
perfect
shade
be
produce
by
a
leaden
comb
.
<EOS>
His
eye
be
not
brilliant
,
but
be
very
effective
,
and
well
under
command
.
<EOS>
He
be
rather
short
-
sighted
,
and
a
pair
of
eye
-
glass
be
always
on
his
nose
,
or
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
His
nose
be
long
,
and
well
pronounce
,
and
his
chin
,
also
,
be
sufficiently
prominent
;
but
the
great
feature
of
his
face
be
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
the
amount
of
secret
medical
knowledge
of
which
he
could
give
assurance
by
the
pressure
of
those
lip
be
truly
wonderful
.
<EOS>
by
his
lip
,
also
,
he
could
be
most
exquisitely
courteous
,
or
most
sternly
forbid
.
<EOS>
and
not
only
could
he
be
either
the
one
or
the
other
;
but
he
could
at
his
will
assume
any
shade
of
difference
between
the
two
,
and
produce
any
mixture
of
sentiment
.
  
<EOS>
when
Dr
Fillgrave
be
first
show
into
Sir
Roger
's
dining
-
room
,
he
walk
up
and
down
the
room
for
a
while
with
easy
,
jaunty
step
,
with
his
hand
join
together
behind
his
back
,
calculate
the
price
of
the
furniture
,
and
count
the
head
which
may
be
adequately
entertain
in
a
room
of
such
noble
proportion
;
but
in
seven
or
eight
minute
an
air
of
impatience
may
have
be
see
to
suffuse
his
face
.
<EOS>
why
could
he
not
be
show
into
the
sick
man
's
room
?
<EOS>
what
necessity
could
there
be
for
keep
him
there
,
as
though
he
be
some
apothecary
with
a
box
of
leech
in
his
pocket
?
<EOS>
He
then
ring
the
bell
,
perhaps
a
little
violently
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
Sir
Roger
know
that
I
be
here
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
say
to
the
servant
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
my
lady
,
"
say
the
man
,
again
vanish
.
  
<EOS>
for
five
minute
more
he
walk
up
and
down
,
calculate
no
longer
the
value
of
the
furniture
,
but
rather
that
of
his
own
importance
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
will
not
to
be
keep
wait
in
this
way
;
and
though
Sir
Roger
Scatcherd
be
at
present
a
great
and
rich
man
,
Dr
Fillgrave
have
remember
him
a
very
small
and
a
very
poor
man
.
<EOS>
He
now
begin
to
think
of
Sir
Roger
as
the
stone
-
mason
,
and
to
chafe
somewhat
more
violently
at
be
so
keep
by
such
a
man
.
  
<EOS>
when
one
be
impatient
,
five
minute
be
as
the
duration
of
all
time
,
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
be
eternity
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
twenty
minute
the
step
of
Dr
fillgrave
up
and
down
the
room
have
become
very
quick
,
and
he
have
just
make
up
his
mind
that
he
would
not
stay
there
all
day
to
the
serious
detriment
,
perhaps
fatal
injury
,
of
his
other
expectant
patient
.
<EOS>
His
hand
be
again
on
the
bell
,
and
be
about
to
be
use
with
vigour
,
when
the
door
open
and
Lady
Scatcherd
enter
.
  
<EOS>
the
door
open
and
Lady
Scatcherd
enter
;
but
she
do
so
very
slowly
,
as
though
she
be
afraid
to
come
into
her
own
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
We
must
go
back
a
little
and
see
how
she
have
be
employ
during
those
twenty
minute
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
such
have
be
her
first
exclamation
on
hear
that
the
doctor
be
in
the
dining

room
.
<EOS>
She
be
stand
at
the
time
with
her
housekeeper
in
a
small
room
in
which
she
keep
her
linen
and
jam
,
and
in
which
,
in
company
with
the
same
housekeeper
,
she
spend
the
happy
moment
of
her
life
.
  
<EOS>
"

add
Hannah

see
that
her
ladyship
still
stand
tremble
in
doubt

bite
her
thumb

<EOS>
"
You
could
not

up

could
you

Hannah

"
say
Lady
Scatcherd
in
her
most
persuasive
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
no

"
say
Hannah
,
after
a
little
deliberation
;
"
no

I
be
afeard
<EOS>
I
could
not

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
must
just
face
it
myself

"
<EOS>
and
up
go
the
wife
to
tell
her
lord
that
the
physician
for
whom
he
have
send
have
come
to
attend
his
bidding
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
interview
which
then
take
place
the
baronet
have
not
indeed
be
violent
,
but
he
have
be
very
determined
.
<EOS>
nothing
on
earth
,
he
say
,
should
induce
him
to
see
Dr
fillgrave
and
offend
his
dear
old
friend
Dr
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
Roger
,
"
say
her
ladyship
,
half
cry
,
or
rather
pretend
to
cry
in
her
vexation
,
"
what
shall
I
do
with
the

<EOS>
how
shall
I
get
him
out

<EOS>
"
  
"
put
him
under

pump

"
say
the
baronet
;
and
he
laugh
his
peculiar
low
guttural
laugh
,
which
tell
so
plainly
of
the
havoc
which
brandy
have
make
in
his
throat
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
nonsense
,
Roger
;
you
know
I
can
not
put
him
under
the
pump

<EOS>
now
you
be
ill
,
and
you
would
better
see
him
just
for
five
minute
.
<EOS>
I
will
make
it
all
right
with
Dr
Thorne

<EOS>
"
I
will
be

all
the

so

indeed

there

"
You
know
you
need

<EOS>
but
there
be
no
coax
Roger
over
now
,

indeed
ever
:
he
be
a
wilful

headstrong
,
masterful
man
;
a
tyrant
always
though
never
a
cruel
one
;
and
accustom
to
rule
his
wife
and
household
as
despotically
as
he
do
his
gang

<EOS>
such
man
it
be
not
easy
to
coax
over

<EOS>
"
You
go
down

tell

I

I

<EOS>
so
Winterbones
,
who
during
this
interview
have
be
at
work
at
his
little
table
,
get
up
to
lock
the
door
,
and
Lady
Scatcherd
have
no
alternative
but
to
pass
through
it
before
the
last
edict
be
obey
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Scatcherd
,
with
slow
step
,
go
downstairs
and
again
seek
counsel
with
Hannah
,
and
the
two
,
put
their
head
together
,
agree
that
the
only
cure
for
the
present
evil
be
to
find
in
a
good
fee
.
<EOS>
so
Lady
Scatcherd
,
with
a
five

pound
note
in
her
hand
,
and
tremble
in
every
limb
,
go
forth
to
encounter
the
august
presence
of
Dr
Fillgrave

<EOS>
as
the
door
open
,
Dr
Fillgrave
drop
the
bell
-
rope
which
be
in
his
hand
,
and
bow
low
to
the
lady
.
<EOS>
those
who
know
the
doctor
well
,
would
have
know
from
his
bow
that
he
be
not
well
pleased
;
it
be
as
much
as
though
he
say
,
"
Lady
Scatcherd

I
be
your
most
obedient
humble
servant

at

as
such

"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Scatcherd
do
not
understand
all
this
;
but
she
perceive
at
once
that
the
man
be
angry

<EOS>
"
I
hope
Sir

do
not
find

bad

say
the

the

vastly
well

vastly
so

I
be
very
glad
to
hear
it

shall
I
step
up

see
Sir

"
  
<EOS>
"
why

Dr

sir

you

he
find
hisself
so
much
hisself
this

a'most
think
it

"
  
<EOS>

"
<EOS>
this
be
the
sort
of
shame

Dr

do
not
at
all
comprehend

"
<EOS>
a
shame

trouble
me

<EOS>
why
Lady
Scatcherd
 
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Scatcherd
see
that
she
have
nothing
for
it
but
to
make
the
whole
matter
intelligible
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
see
that
she
appreciate
more
thoroughly
the
smallness
of
Dr
Fillgrave
's
person
than
she
do
the
peculiar
greatness
of
his
demeanour
,
she
begin
to
be
a
shade
less
afraid
of
him
than
she
have
think
she
should
have
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
Dr
fillgrave
<EOS>
;
you
see
,
when
a
man
like
he
get
well
,
he
can
not
abide
the
idea
of
doctor
:
now
,
yesterday
,
he
be
all
for
send
for
you
;
but
to
-
day
he
come
to
hisself
,
and
do
not
seem
to
want
no
doctor
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
do
Dr
fillgrave
seem
to
grow
out
of
his
boot
,
so
suddenly
do
he
take
upon
himself
sundry
mode
of
expansive
attitude
;
 
to
grow
out
of
his
boot
and
to
swell
upwards
,
till
his
angry
eye
almost
look
down
on
Lady
Scatcherd
,
and
each
erect
hair
bristle
up
towards
the
heaven
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
very
singular

very
singular

Lady
Scatcherd

very
singular

indeed

very
singular

quite
unusual

<EOS>
I
have
come
here
from
Barchester

at
some
considerable
inconvenience

at
some
very
considerable
inconvenience

I
may
say
,
to
my
regular

I
do
not

that
anything
so
very
singular

"
<EOS>
and
then
Dr
Fillgrave
,
with
a
compression
of
his
lip
which
almost
make
the
poor
woman
sink
into
the
ground
,
move
towards
the
door

<EOS>
then
Lady
Scatcherd
bethink
her
of
her
great
panacea

<EOS>
"
It
be
not
about

you

say
she

Sir

not

<EOS>
in

Lady

do
not

quite
close

for
Sir

have
he
know
it

would
by
no

have
assent

<EOS>
"
It

and
then
she
tender
the
bank

note
,
which
she
think
would
immediately
make
all
thing
smooth

<EOS>
now
<EOS>
Dr
Fillgrave

<EOS>
what
physician
be
so
unnatural
as
not
to
love
it
?
<EOS>
He
dearly
love
a
five

pound
fee
;
but
he
love
his
dignity
better
.
<EOS>
He
be
angry
also
;
and
like
all
angry
man
,
he
love
his
grievance
.
<EOS>
He
feel
that
he
have
be
badly
treat
;
but
if
he
take
the
money
he
would
throw
away
his
right
to
indulge
in
any
such
feeling
.
<EOS>
at
that
moment
his
outraged
dignity
and
his
cherish
anger
be
worth
more
than
a
five

pound
note
.
<EOS>
He
look
at
it
with
wishful

still
avert
eye

and
then
sternly
refuse
the
tender

<EOS>
"
no

<EOS>
"
no

no

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
Sir
Roger
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
will
know
better
another
time
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
question
of
money
;
not
at
all

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
a
question
of
money
,
doctor
;
and
you
really
shall

you
must

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
poor
Lady
Scatcherd
,
in
her
anxiety
to
acquit
herself
at
any
rate
of
any
pecuniary
debt
to
the
doctor
,
come
to
personal
close
quarter
with
him
,
with
the
view
of
force
the
note
into
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
quite
impossible
,
quite
impossible
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
still
cherish
his
grievance
,
and
valiantly
reject
the
root
of
all
evil
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
do
anything
of
the
kind

Lady
Scatcherd

"
  
"
now

do

;
to
oblige
me

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
quite
out
of

<EOS>
and
so
,
with
his
hand
and
hat
behind
his
back
,
in
token
of
his
utter
refusal
to
accept
any
pecuniary
accommodation
of
his
injury
,
he
make
his
way
backwards
to
the
door
,
her
ladyship
perseveringly
press
him
in
front
.
<EOS>
so
eager
have
be
the
attack
on
him
,
that
he
have
not
wait
to
give
his
order
about
the
post
-
chaise
,
but
make
his
way
at
once
towards
the
hall
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
do

take
it
,
do

,
"
press
Lady
Scatcherd

<EOS>
"
utterly
out
of
the
question
,
"
say
Dr
Fillgrave
,
with
great
deliberation
,
as
he
back
his
way
into
the
hall
.
<EOS>
as
he
do
so
,
of
course
he
turn
round
,
 
and
he
find
himself
almost
in
the
arm
of
Dr
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
as
Burley
must
have
glare
at
Bothwell
when
they
rush
together
in
the
dread
encounter
on
the
mountain
side
;
as
achille
may
have
glare
at
Hector
when
at
last
they
meet
,
each
resolve
to
test
in
fatal
conflict
the
prowess
of
the
other
,
so
do
Dr
fillgrave
glare
at
his
foe
from
Greshamsbury
,
when
,
on
turn
round
on
his
exalted
heel
,
he
find
his
nose
on
a
level
with
the
top
button
of
Dr
Thorne
's
waistcoat
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
,
if
it
be
not
too
tedious
,
let
us
pause
a
while
to
recapitulate
and
add
up
the
undoubted
grievance
of
the
Barchester
practitioner
.
<EOS>
He
have
make
no
effort
to
ingratiate
himself
into
the
sheepfold
of
that
other
shepherd
-
dog
;
it
be
not
by
his
seeking
that
he
be
now
at
Boxall
Hill
;
much
as
he
hate
Dr
Thorne
,
full
sure
as
he
feel
of
that
man
's
utter
ignorance
,
of
his
incapacity
to
administer
properly
even
a
black
dose
,
of
his
murder
propensity
and
his
low
,
mean
,
unprofessional
style
of
practice
;
nevertheless
,
he
have
do
nothing
to
undermine
him
with
these
Scatcherds
.
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
may
have
send
every
mother
's
son
at
Boxall
Hill
to
his
long
account
,
and
Dr
Fillgrave
would
not
have
interfere
;
 
would
not
have
interfere
unless
specially
and
duly
call
upon
to
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
have
be
specially
and
duly
call
on
.
<EOS>
before
such
a
step
be
take
some
word
must
undoubtedly
have
pass
on
the
subject
between
Thorne
and
the
Scatcherds
.
<EOS>
Thorne
must
have
know
what
be
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
have
be
so
call
,
Dr
Fillgrave
have
come
 
<EOS>
have
come
all
the
way
in
a
post
-
chaise
 
have
be
refuse
admittance
to
the
sick
man
's
room
,
on
the
plea
that
the
sick
man
be
no
longer
sick
;
and
just
as
he
be
about
to
retire
fee
-
less
 
for
the
want
of
the
fee
be
not
the
less
a
grievance
from
the
fact
of
its
have
be
tender
and
refuse
 
fee
-
less
,
dishonour
,
and
<EOS>
in
dudgeon
,
he
encounter
this
other
doctor
 
this
very
rival
whom
he
have
be
send
to
supplant
;
he
encounter
him
in
the
very
act
of
go
to
the
sick
man
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
what
mad
fanatic
Burley
,
what
god
-
succour
insolent
achille
,
ever
have
such
cause
to
swell
with
wrath
as
at
that
moment
<EOS>
have
<EOS>
Dr
Fillgrave
?
<EOS>
have
I
the
pen
of
Moliere
<EOS>
,
I
could
fitly
tell
of
such
medical
anger
,
but
with
no
other
pen
can
it
be
fitly
tell
.
<EOS>
He
do
swell
,
and
when
the
huge
bulk
of
his
wrath
be
add
to
his
natural
proportion
,
he
loom
gigantic
before
the
eye
of
the
surround
follower
of
Sir
Roger
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
step
back
three
step
and
take
his
hat
from
his
head
,
have
,
in
the
passage
from
the
hall
-
door
to
the
dining
-
room
,
hitherto
omit
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
bear
in
mind
that
he
have
no
conception
whatever
that
Sir
Roger
have
decline
to
see
the
physician
for
whom
he
have
send
;
none
whatever
that
the
physician
be
now
about
to
return
,
fee
-
less
,
to
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
and
Dr
Fillgrave
be
doubtless
well
-
know
enemy
.
<EOS>
all
the
world
of
Barchester
,
and
all
that
portion
of
the
world
of
London
which
be
concern
with
the
lancet
and
the
scalping
-
knife
,
be
well
aware
of
this
:
they
be
continually
write
against
each
other
;
continually
speak
against
each
other
;
but
yet
they
have
never
hitherto
come
to
that
positive
personal
collision
which
be
hold
to
justify
a
cut
direct
.
<EOS>
They
very
rarely
see
each
other
;
and
when
they
do
meet
,
it
be
in
some
casual
way
in
the
street
of
Barchester
or
elsewhere
,
and
on
such
occasion
their
habit
have
be
to
bow
with
very
cold
propriety
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
present
occasion
,
Dr
Thorne
of
course
feel
that
Dr
Fillgrave
have
the
whip
-
hand
of
him
;
and
,
with
a
sort
of
manly
feel
on
such
a
point
,
he
conceive
it
to
be
most
compatible
with
his
own
dignity
to
show
,
under
such
circumstance
,
more
than
his
usual
courtesy
 
something
,
perhaps
,
amount
almost
to
cordiality
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
supplant
,
_
quoad
<EOS>
_
doctor
,
in
the
house
of
this
rich
,
eccentric
,
railway
baronet
,
and
he
would
show
that
he
bear
no
malice
on
that
account
.
  
<EOS>
so
he
smile
blandly
as
he
take
off
his
hat
,
and
in
a
civil
speech
he
express
a
hope
that
Dr
Fillgrave
have
not
find
his
patient
to
be
in
any
very
unfavourable
state
.
  
<EOS>
here
be
an
aggravation
to
the
already
lacerated
feeling
of
the
injure
man
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
bring
thither
to
be
scoff
at
and
scorn
at
,
that
he
may
be
a
laughing
-
stock
to
his
enemy
,
and
food
for
mirth
to
the
vile
-
minded
.
<EOS>
He
swell
with
noble
anger
till
he
would
have
burst
,
have
it
not
be
for
the
opportune
padding
of
his
frock
-
coat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
he
;
"
sir
:
"
and
he
could
hardly
get
his
lip
open
to
give
vent
to
the
tumult
of
his
heart
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
be
not
wrong
;
for
it
may
be
that
his
lip
be
more
eloquent
than
would
have
be
his
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
?
"
say
Dr
Thorne
,
open
his
eye
wide
,
and
address
Lady
Scatcherd
over
the
head
and
across
the
hair
of
the
irritated
man
below
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
on
earth
be
the
matter
?
<EOS>
be
anything
wrong
with
Sir
Roger
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh

doctor
!

say
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
law
<EOS>
;
I
be
sure
it
be
not
my
fault
.
<EOS>
here
be
Dr
Fillgrave
in
a
taking
,
and
I
be
quite
ready
to
pay
him
,
 
quite
.
<EOS>
if
a
man
get
pay
,
what
more
can
he
want
?
"
<EOS>
and
she
again
hold
out
the
five
-
pound
note
over
Dr
Fillgrave
's
head
.
  
<EOS>
what
more
,
indeed
,
Lady
Scatcherd
,
can
any
of
us
want
,
if
only
we
could
keep
our
temper
and
feeling
a
little
in
abeyance
?
<EOS>
Dr
Fillgrave
,
however
,
could
not
so
keep
his
;
and
,
therefore
,
he
do
want
something
more
,
though
at
the
present
moment
he
could
have
hardly
say
what
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Scatcherd
's
courage
be
somewhat
resuscitate
by
the
presence
of
her
ancient
trusty
ally
;
and
,
moreover
,
she
begin
to
conceive
that
the
little
man
before
her
be
unreasonable
beyond
all
conscience
in
his
anger
,
see
that
that
for
which
he
be
ready
to
work
have
be
offer
to
him
without
any
work
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
say
he
,
again
turn
round
at
Lady
Scatcherd
,
"
I
be
never
before

such
a
way
in
any
house

"
  
<EOS>
"
good

he
of
Greshamsbury

<EOS>
"
I

and
as
he
shriek
out
the
word
of
the
threat
,
he
stand
on
tiptoe
and
brandish
his
eye
-
glass
up
almost
into
his
enemy
's
face

<EOS>
"
do
not

"
I
shall

Dr

make
another
sudden
demi

pirouette

<EOS>
"
I
be
angry

rather

I

and
complete
the
circle
,
Dr
Fillgrave
again
bring
himself
round
in
full
front
of
his
foe
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
raise
his
eyebrow
and
look
inquiringly
at
Lady
Scatcherd
;
but
there
be
a
quiet
sarcastic
motion
round
his

speak

turn
majestically
to

the

be
too
fond
of

to
absent

Dr

thus
,
order
his

Dr

make

use
all

Dr

get

I
wonder
whether
Sir

laugh
Sir

,
lustily
,
as
Dr
Thorne
enter
the
room

"
<EOS>
well
,
if
that
be

rich

I
do
not
know

<EOS>
ha

<EOS>
but
why
do
they
not
put
him
under
the
pump
,
doctor
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
however
,
have
too
much
tact
,
and
too
many
thing
of
importance
to
say
,
to
allow
of
his
give
up
much
time
to
the
discussion
of
Dr
Fillgrave
's
wrath
.
<EOS>
He
have
come
determined
to
open
the
baronet
's
eye
as
to
what
would
be
the
real
effect
of
his
will
,
and
he
have
also
to
negotiate
a
loan
for
Mr
Gresham
,
if
that
may
be
possible
.
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
therefore
begin
about
the
loan
,
that
be
the
easy
subject
,
and
find
that
Sir
Roger
be
quite
clear
-
headed
as
to
his
money
concern
,
in
spite
of
his
illness
.
<EOS>
Sir
Roger
be
willing
enough
to
lend
Mr
Gresham
more
money
 
<EOS>
six
,
eight
,
ten
,
twenty
thousand
;
but
<EOS>
then
,
in
do
so
,
he
should
insist
on
obtain
possession
of
the
title
-
deed
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
the
title
-
deed
of
Greshamsbury
for
a
few
thousand
pound
?
"
say
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
whether
you
call
ninety
thousand
pound
a
few
thousand
;
but
the
debt
will
about
amount
to
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
that
be
the
old
debt
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
old

new
together

shill
I
lend
more
weaken
my
security
for
what
I
have
lend
before

<EOS>

but
you
have
the
first
claim
,
Sir
Roger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
ought
to
be
first
and
last
to
cover
such
a
debt
as
that

<EOS>
if
he
want
further
accommodation
,
he
must
part
with
his
deed

doctor

"
  
<EOS>
the
point
be
argue
backwards
and
forwards
for
some
time
without
avail
,
and
the
doctor
then
think
it
well
to
introduce
the
other
subject

<EOS>
"
well
,
Sir
Roger
,
you
be
a
hard
man

<EOS>

<EOS>
I
know
I
find
it
hard

come
by

there
be
no

expect
to
find
me
so
very
soft

"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well

there
be
an
end

I
will
tell
you

something
in
the

have
on

<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
at
this
moment
hate
his
friend
the
baronet
with
almost
a
deadly
hatred
;
that
he
,
rough
brute
as
he
be
 
for
he
be
a
rough
brute
 
that
he
should
speak
in
such
language
of
the
angel
who
give
to
that
home
in
Greshamsbury
<EOS>
so
many
of
the
joy
of
Paradise
 
that
he
should
speak
of
her
as
in
some
degree
his
own
,
that
he
should
inquire
doubtingly
as
to
her
attribute
and
her
virtue
.
<EOS>
and
then
the
doctor
think
of
her
italian
and
french
reading
,
of
her
music
,
of
her
nice
book
,
and
sweet
lady
way

of
her
happy
companionship
with
Patience
Oriel

bosom
friendship

He
think
of
her
grace
,
and
win
manner
,

soft
,
polished
feminine
beauty
;
and
,
as
he
do
so
,
he
hate
Sir
Roger
Scatcherd
,
and
regard
him
with
loathing
,
as
he
may
have
regard

seem

Dr

he
perceive
,
do
not

question

<EOS>
He
perceive
,
also
,
that
the
doctor
be
affect
with
some
more
than
ordinary
emotion

<EOS>
why
should
it
be
that
this
subject
of
Mary
Scatcherd

move
him
so
deeply

Sir

have
never

never

he
have
hear

thus
a
glimmer
light
seem
to
come
in

He
have
twit
the

<EOS>
Dr

do
remember
it

<EOS>
in
that
interview
he
remember
many
thing
,
and
much
pass
through
his
mind
on
which
he
feel
himself
compel
to
resolve
somewhat
too
suddenly
.
<EOS>
Would
he
be
justify
in
reject
,
on
behalf
of
Mary
,
the
offer
of
pecuniary
provision
which
this
rich
relative
seem
so
well
inclined
to
make
?
<EOS>
or
,
if
he
accept
it

would
he
in

be
study
her
interest

<EOS>
Scatcherd
be
a
self

willed

obstinate
man
 
now
indeed
touch
by
unwonted
tenderness
;

he
be
one
to
whose
last
tenderness
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
would
be
very
unwilling
to
trust
his
darling
.
<EOS>
He
do
resolve
,
that
on
the
whole
he
should
best
discharge
his
duty
,
even
to
her
,
by
keep
her
to
himself
,
and
reject
,
on
her
behalf
,
any
participation
in
the
baronet
's
wealth
.
<EOS>
as
Mary
herself
have
say
,
"
some
people
must
be
bind
together
;
"
and
their
destiny
,
that
of
himself

his

seem
to
have
so
bind
them

<EOS>
She
have
find
her
place
at
Greshamsbury

her
place
in
the
world

and
it
would
be
well
for
her
now
to
keep
it
,
than
to
go
forth
and
seek
another
that
would
be
rich
,
but
at
the

time
less
suited
to
her

no

he
say
at
last
,
"
she
can
not

,
to
tell
the

do
not

be

listen

me

do
not

to
praise
myself

when
that

be
an
infant

six
month
old

she
be
like
to
be
a
thorough
obstacle

her
mother

fortune
in
life

Tomlinson
be
willing
to
marry
your

he
would
not

take
the
baby

I
promise
her

I
would
be

be
good

I
find
it

such
prescription

ordinance

no

"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
contrive
to
escape
without
give
a
definite
answer
to
this
question
;
and
then

to
Lady

remount
his

and
ride
back
to
Greshamsbury

<EOS>
Sentence
of
Exile
 
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
do
not
at
once
go
home
to
his
own
house
.
<EOS>
when
he
reach
the
Greshamsbury
gate
,
he
send
his
horse
to
its
own
stable
by
one
of
the
people
at
the
lodge
,
and
then
walk
on
to
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
He
have
to
see
the
squire
on
the
subject
of
the
forthcoming
loan
,
and
he
have
also
to
see
Lady
Arabella
.
  
<EOS>
the
Lady
Arabella
,
though
she
be
not
personally
attach
to
the
doctor
with
quite
so
much
warmth
as
some
other
of
her
family
,
still
have
reason
of
her
own
for
not
dispense
with
his
visit
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
be
one
of
his
patient
,
and
a
patient
fearful
of
the
disease
with
which
she
be
threaten
.
<EOS>
though
she
think
the
doctor
to
be
arrogant
,
deficient
as
to
properly
submissive
demeanour
towards
herself
,
an
instigator
to
marital
parsimony
in
her
lord
,
one
altogether
oppose
to
herself
and
her
interest
in
Greshamsbury
politic
,
nevertheless
,
she
do
feel
trust
in
him
as
a
medical
man
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
wish
to
be
rescue
out
of
his
hand
by
any
Dr
Fillgrave
,
as
regard
that
complaint
of
her
,
much
as
she
may
have
desire
,
and
do
desire
,
to
sever
him
from
all
Greshamsbury
council
in
all
matter
not
touch
the
healing
art
.
  
<EOS>
now
the
complaint
of
which
the
Lady
Arabella
be
afraid
,
be
cancer
:
and
her
only
present
confidant
in
this
matter
be
Dr
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
of
the
Greshamsbury
circle
whom
he
see
be
Beatrice
,
and
he
meet
her
in
the
garden
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
doctor
,
"
say
she
,
"
<EOS>
where
have
Mary
be
this
age
?
<EOS>
She
have
not
be
up
here
since
Frank
's
birthday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
that
be
only
three
day
ago
.
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
go
down
and
ferret
her
out
in
the
village
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
have
do
.
<EOS>
I
be
there
just
now
,
and
find
her
out
.
<EOS>
She
be
out
with
Patience
Oriel
.
<EOS>
patience
be
all
and
all
with
her
now
.
<EOS>
patience
be
all
very
well
,
but
if
they
throw
me
over
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
My
dear
Miss
Gresham
,
Patience
be
and
always
be
a
virtue
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
a
poor
,
beggarly
,
sneak
virtue
after
all
,
doctor
.
<EOS>
They
should
have
come
up
,
see
how
desert
I
be
here
.
<EOS>
there
be
absolutely
nobody
left
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
Lady
de
Courcy
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
!
<EOS>
all
the
de
Courcys
have
go
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
between
ourselves
,
Mary
stay
away
because
she
do
not
love
them
too
well
.
<EOS>
They
have
all
go
,
and
take
Augusta
and
Frank
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
Frank
go
to
Courcy
Castle
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
;
do
you
not
hear
?
<EOS>
there
be
rather
a
fight
about
it
.
<EOS>
Master
Frank
want
to
get
off
,
and
be
as
hard
to
catch
as
an
eel
,
and
then
the
countess
be
offend
;
and
papa
say
he
do
not
see
why
Frank
be
to
go
if
he
do
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
papa
be
very
anxious
about
his
degree
,
you
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
understand
it
all
as
well
as
though
it
have
be
describe
to
him
at
full
length
.
<EOS>
the
countess
have
claim
her
prey
,
in
order
that
she
may
carry
him
off
to
Miss
Dunstable
's
golden
embrace
.
<EOS>
the
prey
,
not
yet
old
enough
and
wise
enough
to
connect
the
worship
of
Plutus
with
that
of
Venus
,
have
make
sundry
futile
feint
and
dodge
in
the
vain
hope
of
escape
.
<EOS>
then
the
anxious
mother
have
enforce
the
de
Courcy
behest
with
all
a
mother
's
authority
.
<EOS>
but
the
father
,
whose
idea
on
the
subject
of
Miss
Dunstable
's
wealth
have
probably
not
be
consult
,
have
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
take
exactly
the
other
side
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
do
not
require
to
be
tell
all
this
in
order
to
know
how
the
battle
have
rage
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
yet
hear
of
the
great
dunstable
scheme
;
but
he
be
sufficiently
acquaint
with
Greshamsbury
tactic
to
understand
that
the
war
have
be
carry
on
somewhat
after
this
fashion
.
  
<EOS>
as
a
rule
,
when
the
squire
take
a
point
warmly
to
heart
,
he
be
will
not
to
carry
his
way
against
the
de
Courcy
interest
.
<EOS>
He
could
be
obstinate
enough
<EOS>
when
it
so
please
him
,
and
have
before
now
go
so
far
as
to
tell
his
wife
,
that
her
thrice
-
noble
sister
-
in
-
law
may
remain
at
home
at
Courcy
Castle
 
or
,
at
any
rate
,
not
come
to
Greshamsbury
 
<EOS>
if
she
could
not
do
so
without
strive
to
rule
him
and
every
one
else
when
she
get
here
.
<EOS>
this
have
of
course
be
repeat
to
the
countess
,
who
have
merely
reply
to
it
by
a
sisterly
whisper
,
in
which
she
sorrowfully
intimate
that
some
man
be
bear
brute
,
and
always
would
remain
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
they
all
be
,
"
the
Lady
Arabella
have
reply
;
wishing
,
perhaps
,
to
remind
her
sister
-
in
-
law
that
the
breed
of
brute
be
as
rampant
in
West
Barsetshire
as
in
the
eastern
division
of
the
county
.
  
<EOS>
the
squire
,
however
,
have
not
fight
on
this
occasion
with
all
his
vigour
.
<EOS>
there
have
,
of
course
,
be
some
passage
between
him
and
his
son
,
and
it
have
be
agree
that
Frank
should
go
for
a
fortnight
to
Courcy
Castle
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
not
quarrel
with
them
,
you
know
,
if
we
can
help
it
,
"
say
the
father
;
"
and
,
therefore
,
you
must
go
sooner
or
later
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
suppose
so
;
but
you
do
not
know
how
dull
it
be
,
governor
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
I
!
"
say
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
Miss
Dunstable
to
be
there
;
do
you
ever
hear
of
her
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
never
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
a
girl
whose
father
use
to
make
ointment
,
or
something
of
that
sort
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
to
be
sure
;
the
ointment
of
Lebanon
.
<EOS>
He
use
to
cover
all
the
wall
in
London
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
hear
of
him
this
year
past
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
that
be
because
he
be
dead
.
<EOS>
well
,
she
carry
on
the
ointment
now
,
I
believe
;
at
any
rate
,
she
have
get
all
the
money
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
she
be
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
better
go
and
see
,
"
say
the
father
,
who
now
begin
to
have
some
inkling
of
an
idea
why
the
two
lady
be
so
anxious
to
carry
his
son
off
to
Courcy
Castle
at
this
exact
time
.
<EOS>
and
so
Frank
have
pack
up
his
good
clothe
,
give
a
last
fond
look
at
the
new
black
horse
,
repeat
his
last
special
injunction
to
Peter
,
and
have
then
make
one
of
the
stately
_
cortège
_
which
proceed
through
the
county
from
Greshamsbury
to
Courcy
Castle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
of
that
,
very
,
"
say
the
squire
,
when
he
hear
that
the
money
be
to
be
forthcoming
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
get
it
on
easy
term
from
him
than
elsewhere
;
and
it
kill
me
to
have
continual
bother
about
such
thing
.
"
<EOS>
and
Mr
Gresham
,
feel
that
that
difficulty
be
tide
over
for
a
time
,
and
that
the
immediate
pressure
of
little
debt
would
be
abate
,
stretch
himself
on
his
easy
chair
as
though
he
be
quite
comfortable
;
 
one
may
say
almost
elated
.
  
<EOS>
how
frequent
it
be
that
man
on
their
road
to
ruin
feel
elation
such
as
this
!
<EOS>
a
man
sign
away
a
moiety
of
his
substance
;
nay
,
that
be
nothing
;
but
a
moiety
of
the
substance
of
his
child
;
he
put
his
pen
to
the
paper
that
ruin
him
and
them
;
but
in
do
so
he
free
himself
from
a
score
of
immediate
little
pestering
,
stinging
trouble
:
<EOS>
and
,
therefore
,
feel
as
though
fortune
have
be
almost
kind
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
feel
angry
with
himself
for
what
he
have
do
when
he
see
how
easily
the
squire
adapt
himself
to
this
new
loan
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
make
Scatcherd
's
claim
upon
you
very
heavy
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Gresham
at
once
read
all
that
be
pass
through
the
doctor
's
mind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
what
else
can
I
do
?
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
not
have
me
allow
my
daughter
to
lose
this
match
for
the
sake
of
a
few
thousand
pound
?
<EOS>
It
will
be
well
at
any
rate
to
have
one
of
them
settle
.
<EOS>
look
at
that
letter
from
Moffat
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
take
the
letter
and
read
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
,
wordy
,
ill
-
write
rigmarole
,
in
which
that
amorous
gentleman
speak
with
much
rapture
of
his
love
and
devotion
for
Miss
Gresham
;
but
at
the
same
time
declare
,
and
most
positively
swear
,
that
the
adverse
cruelty
of
his
circumstance
be
such
,
that
it
would
not
allow
him
to
stand
up
like
a
man
at
the
hymeneal
altar
until
six
thousand
pound
hard
cash
have
be
pay
down
at
his
banker
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
all
right
,
"
say
the
squire
;
"
but
in
my
time
gentleman
be
not
use
to
write
such
letter
as
that
to
each
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
shrug
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
how
far
he
would
be
justify
in
say
much
,
even
to
his
friend
the
squire
,
in
dispraise
of
his
future
son
-
in
-
law
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
him
that
he
should
have
the
money
;
and
one
would
have
think
that
that
would
have
be
enough
for
him
.
<EOS>
well
:
I
suppose
Augusta
like
him
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
wish
the
match
;
otherwise
,
I
would
give
him
such
an
answer
to
that
letter
as
would
startle
him
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
settlement
be
he
to
make
?
"
say
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
that
be
satisfactory
enough
;
could
not
be
more
so
;
a
thousand
a
year
and
the
house
at
Wimbledon
for
her
;
that
be
all
very
well
.
<EOS>
but
such
a
lie
,
you
know
,
Thorne
.
<EOS>
He
be
roll
in
money
,
and
yet
he
talk
of
this
beggarly
sum
as
though
he
could
not
possibly
stir
without
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
may
venture
to
speak
my
mind
,
"
say
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
?
"
say
the
squire
,
look
at
him
earnestly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
incline
to
say
that
Mr
Moffat
want
to
cry
off
,
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
impossible
;
quite
impossible
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
he
be
so
very
anxious
for
the
match
.
<EOS>
in
the
next
place
,
it
be
such
a
great
thing
for
him
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
he
would
never
dare
;
you
see
,
he
be
dependent
on
the
de
Courcys
for
his
seat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
suppose
he
lose
his
seat
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
there
be
not
much
fear
of
that
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
Scatcherd
may
be
a
very
fine
fellow
,
but
I
think
they
will
hardly
return
him
at
Barchester
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
much
about
it
,
"
say
Thorne
;
"
but
such
thing
do
happen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
believe
that
this
man
absolutely
want
to
get
off
the
match
;
absolutely
think
of
play
such
a
trick
as
that
on
my
daughter
;
 
on
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
he
intend
to
do
it
;
but
it
look
to
me
as
though
he
be
make
a
door
for
himself
,
or
try
to
make
a
door
:
if
so
,
your
have
the
money
will
stop
him
there

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Thorne
,
do
not
you
think
he
love
the
girl
?
<EOS>
if
I
think
not
 
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
stand
silent
for
a
moment
,
and
then
he
say
,
"
I
be
not
a
love

make
man
myself

but
I
think
that
if
I
be
much
in
love
with
a
young
lady
I
should
not
write
such
a
letter
as
that
to
her
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
by
heaven
!
<EOS>
if
I
think
so
,
"
say
the
squire
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
Thorne
,
we
can
not
judge
of
those
fellow
as
one
do
of
gentleman
;
they
be
so
used
to
make
money
,
and
see
money
make
,
that
they
have
an
eye
to
business
in
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
so
,
perhaps
so
,
"
mutter
the
doctor
,
show
evidently
that
he
still
doubt
the
warmth
of
Mr
Moffat
's
affection
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
match
be
none
of
my
making
,
and
I
can
not
interfere
now
to
break
it
off
:
it
will
give
her
a
good
position
in
the
world
;
for
,
after
all
,
money
go
a
great
way
,
and
it
be
something
to
be
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
hope
she
like
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
truly
hope
she
like
him
;
"
and
the
squire
also
show
by
the
tone
of
his
voice
that
,
though
he
may
hope
that
his
daughter
be
in
love
with
her
intend
husband
,
he
hardly
conceive
it
to
be
possible
that
she
should
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
and
what
be
the
truth
of
the
matter
?
<EOS>
Miss
Gresham
be
no
more
in
love
with
Mr
Moffat
than
you
be
 
oh
,
sweet
,
young
,
bloom
beauty
!
<EOS>
not
a
whit
more
;
not
,
at
least
,
in
your
sense
of
the
word
,
nor
in
mine
.
<EOS>
She
have
by
no
mean
resolve
within
her
heart
that
of
all
the
man
whom
she
have
ever
see
,
or
ever
could
see
,
he
be
far
away
the
nice
and
good
.
<EOS>
that
be
what
you
will
do
when
you
be
in
love
,
if
you
be
good
for
anything
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
longing
to
sit
near
to
him
 
the
nearer
the
well
;
she
have
no
thought
of
his
taste
and
his
choice
when
she
buy
her
ribbon
and
bonnet
;
she
have
no
indescribable
desire
that
all
her
female
friend
should
be
ever
talk
to
her
about
him
.
<EOS>
when
she
write
to
him
,
she
do
not
copy
her
letter
again
and
again
,
so
that
she
may
be
,
as
it
be
,
ever
speak
to
him
;
she
take
no
special
pride
in
herself
because
he
have
choose
her
to
be
his
life
's
partner
.
<EOS>
in
point
of
fact
,
she
do
not
care
one
straw
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
she
think
she
love
him
;
be
,
indeed
,
quite
confident
that
she
do
so
;
<EOS>
tell
her
mother
that
she
be
sure
Gustavus
would
wish
this
,
she
know
Gustavus
would
like
that
,
and
so
on
;
but
as
for
Gustavus
himself
,
she
do
not
care
a
chip
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
in
love
with
her
match
just
as
farmer
be
in
love
with
wheat
at
eighty
shilling
a
quarter
;
or
shareholder
 
innocent
gudgeon
 
with
seven
and
half
per

.
<EOS>
interest
on
their
pay
-
up
capital
.
<EOS>
eighty
shilling
a
quarter
,
and
seven
and
half
per
cent
.
<EOS>
interest
,
such
be
the
return
which
she
have
be
teach
to
look
for
in
exchange
for
her
young
heart
;
and
,
have
obtain
them
,
or
be
thus
about
to
obtain
them
,
why
should
not
her
young
heart
be
satisfied
?
<EOS>
have
she
not
sit
herself
down
obediently
at
the
foot
of
her
lady
Gamaliel
,
and
should
she
not
be
reward
?
<EOS>
yes
,
indeed
,
she
shall
be
reward
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
the
doctor
go
to
the
lady
.
<EOS>
on
their
medical
secret
we
will
not
intrude
;
but
there
be
other
matter
bear
on
the
course
of
our
narrative
,
as
to
which
Lady
Arabella
find
it
necessary
to
say
a
word
or
so
to
the
doctor
;
and
it
be
essential
that
we
should
know
what
be
the
tenor
of
those
few
word
so
spoken
.
  
<EOS>
how
the
aspiration
,
and
instinct
,
and
feeling
of
a
household
become
change
as
the
young
bird
begin
to
flutter
with
feather
wing
,
and
have
half
-
form
thought
of
leave
the
parental
nest
!
<EOS>
a
few
month
back
,
Frank
have
reign
almost
autocratic
over
the
less
subject
of
the
kingdom
of
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
the
servant
,
for
instance
,
always
obey
him
,
and
his
sister
never
dream
of
tell
anything
which
he
direct
should
not
be
tell
.
<EOS>
all
his
mischief
,
all
his
trouble
,
and
all
his
love
be
confide
to
them
,
with
the
sure
conviction
that
they
would
never
be
make
to
stand
in
evidence
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
trust
to
this
well
-
ascertain
state
of
thing
,
he
have
not
hesitate
to
declare
his
love
for
Miss
Thorne
before
his
sister
Augusta
.
<EOS>
but
his
sister
Augusta
have
now
,
as
it
be
,
be
receive
into
the
upper
house
;
have
duly
receive
,
and
duly
profit
by
the
lesson
of
her
great
instructress
,
she
be
now
admit
to
sit
in
conclave
with
the
high
power
:
her
sympathy
,
of
course
,
become
changed
,
and
her
confidence
be
remove
from
the
young
and
giddy
and
give
to
the
ancient
and
discreet
.
<EOS>
She
be
as
a
schoolboy
,
who
,
have
finish
his
schooling
,
and
be
fairly
force
by
necessity
into
the
stern
bread
-
earn
world
,
undertake
the
new
duty
of
tutoring
.
<EOS>
yesterday
he
be
teach
,
and
fight
,
of
course
,
against
the
schoolmaster
;
to
-
day
he
teach
,
and
fight
as
keenly
for
him
.
<EOS>
so
it
be
with
Augusta
Gresham
,
when
,
with
careful
brow
,
she
whisper
to
her
mother
that
there
be
something
wrong
between
Frank
and
Mary
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
"
stop
it
at
once
,
Arabella
:
stop
it
at
once
,
"
the
countess
have
say
;
"
that
,
indeed
,
will
be
ruin
.
<EOS>
if
he
do
not
marry
money
,
he
be
lose
.
<EOS>
good
heaven
!
<EOS>
the
doctor
's
niece
!
<EOS>
a
girl
that
nobody
know
where
she
come
from
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
go
with
you
to
-
morrow
,
you
know
,
"
say
the
anxious
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
and
that
be
so
far
well
<EOS>
:
if
he
will
be
lead
by
me
,
the
evil
may
be
remedie
before
he
return
;
but
it
be
very
,
very
hard
to
lead
young
man
.
<EOS>
Arabella
,
you
must
forbid
that
girl
to
come
to
Greshamsbury
again
on
any
pretext
whatever
.
<EOS>
the
evil
must
be
stop
at
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
she
be
here
so
much
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
she
must
be
here
as
a
matter
of
course
no
more
:
there
have
be
folly
,
very
great
folly
,
in
have
her
here
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
would
turn
out
to
be
a
design
creature
with
such
temptation
before
her
;
with
such
a
prize
within
her
reach
,
how
could
she
help
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
say
,
aunt
,
she
answer
him
very
properly
,
"
say
Augusta
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
"
say
the
countess
;
"
before
you
,
of
course
she
do
.
<EOS>
Arabella
,
the
matter
must
not
be
leave
to
the
girl
's
propriety
.
<EOS>
I
never
know
the
propriety
of
a
girl
of
that
sort
to
be
fit
to
be
depend
upon
yet
.
<EOS>
if
you
wish
to
save
the
whole
family
from
ruin
,
you
must
take
step
to
keep
her
away
from
Greshamsbury
now
at
once
.
<EOS>
now
be
the
time
;
now
that
Frank
be
to
be
away
.
<EOS>
where
so
much
,
so
very
much
depend
on
a
young
man
's
marry
money
,
not
one
day
ought
to
be
lose
.
"
  
<EOS>
instigate
in
this
manner
,
Lady
Arabella
resolve
to
open
her
mind
to
the
doctor
,
and
to
make
it
intelligible
to
him
that
,
under
present
circumstance
,
Mary
's
visit
at
Greshamsbury
have
better
be
discontinue
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
give
much
,
however
,
to
have
escape
this
business
.
<EOS>
She
have
in
her
time
try
one
or
two
fall
with
the
doctor
,
and
she
be
conscious
that
she
have
never
yet
get
the
well
of
him
:
and
then
she
be
in
a
slight
degree
afraid
of
Mary
herself
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
presentiment
that
it
would
not
be
so
easy
to
banish
Mary
from
Greshamsbury
:
she
be
not
sure
that
that
young
lady
would
not
boldly
assert
her
right
to
her
place
in
the
school
-
room
;
appeal
loudly
to
the
squire
,
and
perhaps
,
declare
her
determination
of
marry
the
heir
,
out
before
them
all
.
<EOS>
the
squire
would
be
sure
to
uphold
her
in
that
,
or
in
anything
else
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
,
too
,
there
would
be
the
great
difficulty
in
word
her
request
to
the
doctor
;
and
Lady
Arabella
be
sufficiently
conscious
of
her
own
weakness
to
know
that
she
be
not
always
very
good
at
word
.
<EOS>
but
the
doctor
,
when
hard
pressed
,
be
never
at
fault
:
he
could
say
the
bitter
thing
in
the
quiet
tone
,
and
Lady
Arabella
have
a
great
dread
of
these
bitter
thing
.
<EOS>
what
,
also
,
if
he
should
desert
her
himself
;
withdraw
from
her
his
skill
and
knowledge
of
her
bodily
want
and
ailment
now
that
he
be
so
necessary
to
her
?
<EOS>
She
have
once
before
take
that
measure
of
send
to
Barchester
for
Dr
Fillgrave
,
but
it
have
answer
with
her
hardly
well
than
with
Sir
Roger
and
Lady
Scatcherd
.
  
<EOS>
when
,
therefore
,
Lady
Arabella
find
herself
alone
with
the
doctor
,
and
call
upon
to
say
out
her
say
in
what
good
language
she
could
select
for
the
occasion
,
she
do
not
feel
to
very
much
at
her
ease
.
<EOS>
there
be
that
about
the
man
before
her
which
cow
her
,
in
spite
of
her
be
the
wife
of
the
squire
,
the
sister
of
an
earl
,
a
person
quite
acknowledge
to
be
of
the
great
world
,
and
the
mother
of
the
very
important
young
man
whose
affection
be
now
about
to
be
call
in
question
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
there
be
the
task
to
be
do
,
and
with
a
mother
's
courage
she
essay
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dr
Thorne
,
"
say
she
,
as
soon
as
their
medical
conference
be
at
an
end
,
"
I
be
very
glad
you
come
over
to
-
day
,
for
I
have
something
special
which
I
want
to
say
to
you
:
"
so
far
she
get
,
and
then
stop
;
but
,
as
the
doctor
do
not
seem
inclined
to
give
her
any
assistance
,
she
be
force
to
flounder
on
as
best
she
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
something
very
particular
indeed
.
<EOS>
You
know
what
a
respect
and
esteem
,
and
I
may
say
affection
,
we
all
have
for
you
,
"
 
here
the
doctor
make
a
low
bow
 
"
<EOS>
and
I
may
say
for
Mary
also
;
"
here
the
doctor
bow
himself
again
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
do
what
little
we
could
to
be
pleasant
neighbour
,
and
I
think
you
will
believe
me
when
I
say
that
I
be
a
true
friend
to
you
and
<EOS>
dear
Mary
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
know
that
something
very
unpleasant
be
come
,
but
he
could
not
at
all
guess
what
may
be
its
nature
.
<EOS>
He
feel
,
however
,
that
he
must
say
something
;
so
he
express
a
hope
that
he
be
duly
sensible
of
all
the
act
of
kindness
he
have
ever
receive
from
the
squire
and
the
family
at
large
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
therefore
,
my
dear
doctor
,
you
will
not
take
amiss
what
I
be
go
to
say
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Lady
Arabella
,
I
will
endeavour
not
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
would
not
give
any
pain
if
I
could
help
it
,
much
less
to
you
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
occasion
,
doctor
,
in
which
duty
must
be
paramount
;
paramount
to
all
other
consideration
,
you
know
,
and
,
certainly
,
this
occasion
be
one
of
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
be
the
occasion
,
Lady
Arabella
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
,
doctor
.
<EOS>
You
know
what
Frank
's
position
be
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Frank
's
position
!
<EOS>
as
regard
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
his
position
in
life
;
an
only
son
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
;
I
know
his
position
in
that
respect
;
an
only
son
,
and
his
father
's
heir
;
and
a
very
fine
fellow
,
he
be
.
<EOS>
You
have
but
one
son
,
Lady
Arabella
,
and
you
may
well
be
proud
of
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
sigh
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
wish
at
the
present
moment
to
express
herself
as
be
in
any
way
proud
of
Frank
.
<EOS>
She
be
desirous
rather
,
on
the
other
hand
,
of
show
that
she
be
a
good
deal
ashamed
of
him
;
only
not
quite
so
much
ashamed
of
him
as
it
behove
the
doctor
to
be
of
his
niece
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
perhaps
so
;
yes
,
"
say
Lady
Arabella
,
"
he
be
,
I
believe
,
a
very
good
young
man
,
with
an
excellent
disposition
;
but
,
doctor
,
his
position
be
very
precarious
;
and
he
be
just
at
that
time
of
life
when
every
caution
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
to
the
doctor
's
ear
,
Lady
Arabella
be
now
talk
of
her
son
as
a
mother
may
of
her
infant
when
whooping
-
cough
be
abroad
or
croup
imminent
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
on
earth
the
matter
with
him
,
I
should
say
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
have
every
possible
sign
of
perfect
health
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
;
his
health
!
<EOS>
yes
,
thank
God
,
his
health
be
good
;
that
be
a
great
blessing
.
"
<EOS>
and
Lady
Arabella
think
of
her
four
floweret
that
have
already
fade
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
be
most
thankful
to
see
him
grow
up
so
strong
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
that
I
mean
,
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
what
be
it
,
Lady
Arabella
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
doctor
,
you
know
the
squire
's
position
with
regard
to
money
matter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
now
the
doctor
undoubtedly
do
know
the
squire
's
position
with
regard
to
money
matter
,
 
know
it
much
better
than
do
Lady
Arabella
;
but
he
be
by
no
mean
inclined
to
talk
on
that
subject
to
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
He
remain
quite
silent
,
therefore
,
although
Lady
Arabella
's
last
speech
have
take
the
form
of
a
question
.
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
be
a
little
offend
at
this
want
of
freedom
on
his
part
,
and
become
somewhat
sterner
in
her
tone
 
<EOS>
a
thought
less
condescending
in
her
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
squire
have
unfortunately
embarrass
the
property
,
and
Frank
must
look
forward
to
inherit
it
with
very
heavy
encumbrance
;
I
fear
very
heavy
indeed
,
though
of
what
exact
nature
I
be
keep
in
ignorance
.
"
  
<EOS>
look
at
the
doctor
's
face
,
she
perceive
that
there
be
no
probability
whatever
that
her
ignorance
would
be
enlighten
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
,
therefore
,
it
be
highly
necessary
that
Frank
should
be
very
careful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
to
his
private
expenditure
,
you
mean
?
"
say
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
not
exactly
that
:
though
of
course
he
must
be
careful
as
to
that
,
too
;
that
be
of
course
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
not
what
I
mean
,
doctor
;
his
only
hope
of
retrieve
his
circumstance
be
by
marry
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
with
every
other
conjugal
blessing
that
a
man
can
have
,
I
hope
he
may
have
that
also
.
"
<EOS>
so
the
doctor
reply
with
imperturbable
face
;
but
not
the
less
do
he
begin
to
have
a
shade
of
suspicion
of
what
may
be
the
come
subject
of
the
conference
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
untrue
to
say
that
he
have
ever
think
it
probable
that
the
young
heir
should
fall
in
love
with
his
niece
;
that
he
have
ever
look
forward
to
such
a
chance
,
either
with
complacency
or
with
fear
;
nevertheless
,
the
idea
have
of
late
pass
through
his
mind
.
<EOS>
some
word
have
fall
from
Mary
,
some
closely
watch
expression
of
her
eye
,
or
some
quiver
in
her
lip
when
Frank
's
name
be
mention
,
have
of
late
make
him
involuntarily
think
that
such
may
not
be
impossible
;
and
then
,
when
the
chance
of
Mary
become
the
heiress
to
<EOS>
so
large
a
fortune
have
be
force
upon
his
consideration
,
he
have
be
unable
to
prevent
himself
from
build
happy
castle
in
the
air
,
as
he
ride
slowly
home
from
Boxall
Hill
.
<EOS>
but
not
a
whit
the
more
on
that
account
be
he
prepare
to
be
untrue
to
the
squire
's
interest
or
to
encourage
a
feeling
which
must
be
distasteful
to
all
the
squire
's
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
doctor
;
he
must
marry
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
worth
,
Lady
Arabella
;
and
a
pure
feminine
heart
;
and
youth
and
beauty
.
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
marry
them
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Could
it
be
possible
,
that
in
speak
of
a
pure
feminine
heart
,
and
youth
and
beauty
,
and
such
like
gewgaw
,
the
doctor
be
think
of
his
niece
?
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
he
have
absolutely
make
up
his
mind
to
foster
and
encourage
this
odious
match
?
  
<EOS>
the
bare
idea
make
Lady
Arabella
wrathful
,
and
her
wrath
give
her
courage
.
"
<EOS>
He
must
marry
money
,
or
he
will
be
a
ruin
man
.
<EOS>
now

now

wrathful

thing

<EOS>
what
word

angry
as

bear

a

past

can
not

over

take
twenty
year

in

he

could
not

ill

he
now
begin

badly

he
could
not

almost
be
bear
into

with

intimate

bow
low

leave
the
room

saunter
slowly
away
to
his

home

<EOS>
what
be
he
to
say
to
Mary
?
<EOS>
He
walk
very
slowly
down
the
Greshamsbury
avenue
,
with
his
hand
clasp
behind
his
back
,
think
over
the
whole
matter

think
of
it
,
or
rather
try
to
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
when
a
man
's

be
warmly
concerned

it
be

useless

he
give
play

feed

indulge
it

<EOS>
"
allurement

"
<EOS>
he
say
to
himself

repeat
Lady

a
girl
circumstance

<EOS>
how
utterly
incapable
be
such
a
woman

understand
the
mind

and
heart
,

soul

such
a

Thorne

then
his
thought
recur
to
Frank

<EOS>
"
It
have
be
ill
do

ill
done

young
as

have
have
feel
enough

have
spare
me
this

a
thoughtless
word
have
be
speak

will
now
make
her
miserable

"
<EOS>
and
then
,
as
he
walk
on
,
he
could
not
divest
his
mind
of
the
remembrance
of
what
have
pass
between
him
and
Sir
Roger
.
<EOS>
what
,
if
after
all
,
Mary
should
become
the
heiress
to
all
that
money
?
<EOS>
what
,
if
she
should
become
,
in
fact
,
the
owner
of
Greshamsbury
?
<EOS>
for
,
indeed
it
seem
too
possible
that
Sir
Roger
's
heir
would
be
the
owner
of
Greshamsbury
.
  
<EOS>
the
idea
be
one
which
he
dislike
to
entertain
,
but
it
would
recur
to
him
again
and
again
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
,
that
a
marriage
between
his
niece
and
the
nominal
heir
to
the
estate
may
be
of
all
the
match
the
good
for
young
Gresham
to
make
.
<EOS>
how
sweet
would
be
the
revenge
,
<EOS>
how
glorious
the
retaliation
on
Lady
Arabella
,
if
,
after
what
have
now
be
say
,
it
should
come
to
pass
that
all
the
difficulty
of
Greshamsbury
should
be
make
smooth
by
Mary
's
love
,
and
Mary
's
hand
!
<EOS>
It
be
a
dangerous
subject
on
which
to
ponder
;
and
,
as
he
saunter
down
the
road
,
the
doctor
do
his
good
to
banish
it
from
his
mind
,
 
not
altogether
successfully
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
he
go
he
again
encounter
Beatrice
.
"
<EOS>
tell
Mary
<EOS>
I
go
to
her
to
-
day
,

say
she
,
"
and
that
I
expect
her
up
here
to
-
morrow

if
she
do
not
come

I
shall
be
savage

<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
be
savage

say
he
,
put
out
his
hand
,
"
even
though
she
should
not
come

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Beatrice
immediately
see
that
his
manner
with
her
be
not
playful
,
and
that
his
face
be
serious
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
only
in
joke
,

say
she
;
"
of
course
I
be
only
joke

be
anything
the
matter

Mary
ill
?

no

not
ill

will
not

probably
for

time

,
Miss
Gresham
,
you
must
not
be
savage
with
her

"
  
<EOS>
Beatrice
try
to
interrogate
him
,
but
he
would
not
wait
to
answer
her
question
.
<EOS>
while
she
be
speak
he
bow
to
her
in
his
usual
old
-
fashioned
courteous
way
,
and
pass
on
out
of
hearing
.
<EOS>
"
She
will
not
come
up
for
some
time
,

say
Beatrice
to
herself
.
<EOS>
"
then
mamma
must
have
quarrel
with
her

"
<EOS>
and

her

<EOS>
the

,
when
he
arrive
at

have
in
nowise
make
up
his
mind
as
to
the
manner
in
which
he
would
break
the
matter
to
Mary

but
by
the
time
that
he
have
reach
the
drawing

room
,
he
have
make
up
his
mind
to
this
,
that
he
would
put
off
the
evil
hour
till
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
would
sleep
on
the
matter
 
lie
awake
on
it
,
more
probably
 
<EOS>
and
then
at
breakfast
,
as
best
he
could
,
tell
her
what

of
her

<EOS>
Mary
that
evening
be
more
than

<EOS>
She
have
not
be
quite
certain
till
the
morning
,
whether
Frank

absolutely
leave
Greshamsbury
,
and
have
,
therefore
,
prefer
the
company
of
Miss
Oriel
to
go
up
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
peculiar
cheerfulness
about
her
friend
Patience
,
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
with
the
world
and
those
in
it
,
which
Mary
always
share
with
her
;
and
now
she
have
bring
home
to
the
doctor
's
fireside
,
in
spite
of
her
young
trouble
,
a
smile
face

altogether
happy

"

He
look

and
then
,
get
up
from

pass
his

"

but
still
he
tell

that
night

<EOS>
Courcy
 
<EOS>
when
Frank
Gresham
express
to
his
father
an
opinion
that
Courcy
Castle
be
dull
,
the
squire
,
as
may
be
remember
,
do
not
pretend
to
differ
from
him
.
<EOS>
to
man
such
as
the
squire
,
and
such
as
the
squire
's
son
,
Courcy
Castle
be
dull
.
<EOS>
to
what
class
of
man
<EOS>
it
would
not
be
dull
<EOS>
the
author
be
not
prepared
to
say
;
but
it
may
be
presume
that
the
de
Courcys
find
it
to
their
liking
,
or
they
would
have
make
it
other
than
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
castle
itself
be
a
huge
brick
pile
,
build
in
the
day
of
William
III
,
which
,
though
they
be
grand
for
day
of
the
construction
of
the
Constitution
,
be
not
very
grand
for
architecture
of
a
more
material
description
.
<EOS>
It
have
,
no
doubt
,
a
perfect
right
to
be
call
a
castle
,
as
it
be
enter
by
a
castle
-
gate
which
lead
into
a
court
,
the
porter
's
lodge
for
which
be
build
as
it
be
into
the
wall
;
there
be
attach
to
it
also
two
round
,
stumpy
adjunct
,
which
be
,
perhaps
properly
,
call
tower
,
though
they
do
not
do
much
in
the
way
of
towering
;
and
,
moreover
,
along
one
side
of
the
house
,
over
what
would
otherwise
have
be
the
cornice
,
there
run
a
castellate
parapet
,
through
the
assistance
of
which
,
the
imagination
no
doubt
be
intend
to
supply
the
muzzle
of
defiant
artillery
.
<EOS>
but
any
artillery
which
would
have
so
present
its
muzzle
must
have
be
very
small
,
and
it
may
be
doubt
whether
even
a
bowman
could
have
obtain
shelter
there
.
  
<EOS>
the
ground
about
the
castle
be
not
very
inviting
,
nor
,
as
ground
,
very
extensive
;
though
,
no
doubt
,
the
entire
domain
be
such
as
suit
the
importance
of
so
puissant
a
nobleman
as
Earl
de
Courcy
.
<EOS>
what
,
indeed
,
should
have
be
the
park
be
divide
out
into
various
large
paddock
.
<EOS>
the
surface
be
flat
and
unbroken
;
and
though
there
be
magnificent
elm
-
tree
stand
in
straight
line
,
like
hedgerow
,
the
timber
have
not
that
beautiful
,
wild
,
scattered
look
which
generally
give
the
great
charm
to
english
scenery
.
  
<EOS>
the
town
of
Courcy
 
for
the
place
claim
to
rank
as
a
town
 
be
in
many
particular
like
the
castle
.
<EOS>
It
be
build
of
dingy
-
red
brick
 
almost
more
brown
than
red
 
and
be
solid
,
dull
-
looking
,
ugly
and
comfortable
.
<EOS>
It
consist
of
four
street
,
which
be
form
by
two
road
cross
each
other
,
make
at
the
point
of
junction
a
centre
for
the
town
.
<EOS>
here
stand
the
Red
Lion
;
have
it
be
call
the
brown
lion
<EOS>
,
the
nomenclature
would
have
be
more
strictly
correct
;
and
here
,
in
the
old
day
of
coaching
,
some
life
have
be
will
not
to
stir
itself
at
those
hour
in
the
day
and
night
when
the
Freetraders
,
Tallyhoes
,
and
Royal
Mails
change
their
horse
.
<EOS>
but
now
there
be
a
railway
station
a
mile
and
a
half
distant
,
and
the
move
life
of
the
town
of
Courcy
be
confine
to
the
Red
Lion
omnibus
,
which
seem
to
pass
its
entire
time
in
go
up
and
down
between
the
town
and
the
station
,
quite
unembarrassed
by
any
great
weight
of
passenger
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
,
so
say
the
Courcyites
when
away
from
Courcy
,
excellent
shop
in
the
place
;
but
they
be
not
the
less
accustomed
,
when
at
home
among
themselves
,
to
complain
to
each
other
of
the
vile
extortion
with
which
they
be
treat
by
their
neighbour
.
<EOS>
the
ironmonger
,
therefore
,
though
he
loudly
assert
that
he
could
beat
Bristol
in
the
quality
of
his
ware
in
one
direction
,
and
undersell
Gloucester
in
another
,
buy
his
tea
and
sugar
on
the
sly
in
one
of
those
large
town
;
and
the
grocer
,
on
the
other
hand
,
equally
distrust
the
pot
and
pan
of
home
production
.
<EOS>
trade
,
therefore
,
at
Courcy
,
have
not
thrive
since
the
railway
have
open
:
and
,
indeed
,
have
any
patient
inquirer
stand
at
the
cross
through
one
entire
day
,
count
customer
who
enter
the
neighbouring
shop
,
he
may
well
have
wonder
that
any
shop
in
Courcy
could
be
keep
open
.
  
<EOS>
and
how
change
have
be
the
bustle
of
that
once
noisy
inn
to
the
present
death
-
like
silence
of
its
green
courtyard
!
<EOS>
there
,
a
lame
ostler
crawl
about
with
his

thrust
into
the
capacious

of
his

<EOS>
that
weary

and
three

be
all
that
now
grace
those
stable
where
horse

close

by

dozen

where
twenty
grain
apiece
,
abstract
from
every
feed
of
oat
consume
during
the

,
would
have
afford
a
daily
quart

the
lucky

<EOS>
Courcy
Castle
be
certainly
a
dull
place
to
look
at
,
and
Frank
,
in
his
former
visit
,
have
find
that
the
appearance
do
not
belie
the
reality
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
but
little
there
when
the
earl
have
be
at
Courcy
;
and
as
he
have
always
feel
from
his
childhood
a
peculiar
distaste
to
the
governance
of
his
aunt
the
countess
,
this
perhaps
may
have
add
to
his
feeling
of
dislike
.
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
the
castle
be
to
be
full
than
he
have
ever
before
know
it
;
the
earl
be
to
be
at
home
;
there
be
some
talk
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
come
for
a
day
or
two
,
though
that
seem
doubtful
;
there
be
some
faint
doubt
of
Lord
Porlock
;
Mr
Moffat
,
intent
on
the
come
election
 
and
also
,
let
us
hope
,
on
his
come
bliss
 
be
to
be
one
of
the
guest
;
and
there
be
also
to
be
the
great
Miss
Dunstable
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
,
however
,
find
that
those
grandee
be
not
expect
quite
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
go
back
to
Greshamsbury
for
three
or
four
day
as
she
be
not
to
be
here
,
"
he
say
naïvely
to
his
aunt
,
express
,
with
tolerable
perspicuity
,
his
feeling
,
that
he
regard
his
visit
to
Courcy
Castle
quite
as
a
matter
of
business
.
<EOS>
but
the
countess
would
hear
of
no
such
arrangement
.
<EOS>
now
that
she
have
get
him
,
she
be
not
go
to
let
him
fall
back
into
the
peril
of
Miss
Thorne
's
intrigue
,
or
even
of
Miss
Thorne
's
propriety
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
quite
essential
,
"
she
say
,
"
that
you
should
be
here
a
few
day
before
her
,
so
that
she
may
see
that
you
be
at
home
.
"
<EOS>
Frank
do
not
understand
the
reasoning
;
but
he
feel
himself
unable
to
rebel
,
and
he
therefore
,
remain
there
,
comfort
himself
,
as
best
he
may
,
with
the
eloquence
of
the
Honourable
George
,
and
the
sport
humour
of
the
honourable
John
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Moffat
's
be
the
early
arrival
of
any
importance
.
<EOS>
Frank
have
not
hitherto
make
the
acquaintance
of
his
future
brother
-
in
-
law
,
and
there
be
,
therefore
,
some
little
interest
in
the
first
interview
.
<EOS>
Mr
Moffat
be
show
into
the
drawing
-
room
before
the
lady
have
go
up
to
dress
,
and
it
so
happen
that
Frank
be
there
also
.
<EOS>
as
no
one
else
be
in
the
room
but
his
sister
and
two
of
his
cousin
,
he
have
expect
to
see
the
lover
rush
into
each
other
's
arm
.
<EOS>
but
Mr
Moffat
restrain
his
ardour
,
and
Miss
Gresham
seem
contented
that
he
should
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
nice
,
dapper
man
,
rather
above
the
middle
height
,
and
good
-
look
enough
have
he
have
a
little
more
expression
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
have
dark
hair
,
very
nicely
brush
,
small
black
whisker
,
and
a
small
black
moustache
.
<EOS>
His
boot
be
excellently
well
make
,
and
his
hand
be
very
white
.
<EOS>
He
simper
gently
as
he
take
hold
of
Augusta
's
finger
,
and
express
a
hope
that
she
have
be
quite
well
since
last
he
have
the
pleasure
of
see
her
.
<EOS>
then
he
touch
the
hand
of

"
Mr
Moffat
,
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
my
brother
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
most
happy
,
I
be
sure
,
"
say
Mr
Moffat
,
again
put
out
his
hand
,
and
allow
it
to
slip
through
Frank
's
grasp
,
as
he
speak
in
a
pretty
,
mince
voice
:
"
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
quite
well
?
 
<EOS>
and
your
father
,
and
sister
?
<EOS>
very
warm
be
not
it
?
 
<EOS>
quite
hot
in
town
,
I
do
assure
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
Augusta
like
him
,
"
say
Frank
to
himself
,
argue
on
the
subject
exactly
as
his
father
have
do
;
"
but
for
an
engaged
lover
he
seem
to
me
to
have
a
very
queer
way
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Frank
,
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
who
be
of
a
coarser
mould
,
would
,
under
such
circumstance
,
have
be
all
for
kiss
 
sometimes
,
indeed
,
even
under
other
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Moffat
do
not
do
much
towards
improve
the
conviviality
of
the
castle
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
of
course
,
a
good
deal
intent
upon
his
come
election
,
and
spend
much
of
his
time
with
Mr
Nearthewinde
,
the
celebrated
parliamentary
agent
.
<EOS>
It
behove
him
to
be
a
good
deal
at
Barchester
,
canvass
the
elector
and
undermine
,
by
Mr
Nearthewinde
's
aid
,
the
mine
for
blow
him
out
of
his
seat
,
which
be
daily
be
contrive
by
Mr
Closerstil
,
on
behalf
of
Sir
Roger
.
<EOS>
the
battle
be
to
be
fight
on
the
internecine
principle
,
no
quarter
be
give
or
take
on
either
side
;
and
of
course
this
give
Mr
Moffat
as
much
as
he
know
how
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Closerstil
be
well
known
to
be
the
sharp
man
at
his
business
in
all
England
,
unless
the
palm
should
be
give
to
his
great
rival
Mr
Nearthewinde
;
and
in
this
instance
he
be
to
be
assist
in
the
battle
by
a
very
clever
young
barrister
,
Mr
Romer
,
who
be
an
admirer
of
Sir
Roger
's
career
in
life
.
<EOS>
some
people
in
Barchester
,
when
they
see
Sir
Roger
,
Closerstil
and
Mr
Romer
saunter
down
the
High
Street
,
arm
in
arm
,
declare
that
it
be
all
up
with
poor
moffat
;
but
other
,
in
whose
head
the
bump
of
veneration
be
strongly
pronounce
,
whisper
to
each
other
that
great
shibboleth
 
<EOS>
the
name
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
 
and
mildly
assert
it
to
be
impossible
that
the
duke
's
nominee
should
be
throw
out
.
  
<EOS>
Our
poor
friend
the
squire
do
not
take
much
interest
in
the
matter
,
except
in
so
far
that
he
like
his
son
-
in
-
law
to
be
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
both
the
candidate
be
in
his
eye
equally
wrong
in
their
opinion
.
<EOS>
He
have
long
since
recant
those
error
of
his
early
youth
,
which
have
cost
him
his
seat
for
the
county
,
and
have
abjure
the
de
Courcy
politic
.
<EOS>
He
be
staunch
enough
as
a
Tory
now
that
his
be
so
would
no
longer
be
of
the
slight
use
to
him
;
but
the
Duke
of
Omnium
,
and
Lord
de
Courcy
,
and
Mr
Moffat
be
all
Whigs
;
Whigs
,
however
,
differ
altogether
in
politic
from
Sir
Roger
,
who
belong
to
the
Manchester
school
,
and
whose
pretension
,
through
some
of
those
inscrutable
twist
in
modern
politic
which
be
quite
unintelligible
to
the
mind
of
ordinary
man
outside
the
circle
,
be
on
this
occasion
secretly
favour
by
the
high
conservative
party
.
  
<EOS>
how
Mr
Moffat
,
who
have
be
bring
into
the
political
world
by
Lord
de
Courcy
,
obtain
all
the
weight
of
the
duke
's
interest
I
never
could
exactly
learn
.
<EOS>
for
the
duke
and
the
earl
do
not
generally
act
as
twin
-
brother
on
such
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
difference
in
Whigs
.
<EOS>
Lord
de
Courcy
be
a
Court
Whig
,
follow
the
fortune
,
and
enjoy
,
when
he
could
get
it
,
the
sunshine
of
the
throne
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
sojourner
at
Windsor
,
and
a
visitor
at
Balmoral
.
<EOS>
He
delight
in
gold
stick
,
and
be
never
so
happy
as
when
hold
some
cap
of
maintenance
or
spur
of
precedence
with
due
dignity
and
acknowledge
grace
in
the
presence
of
all
the
Court
.
<EOS>
His
mean
have
be
somewhat
embarrassed
by
early
extravagance
;
and
,
therefore
,
as
it
be
to
his
taste
to
shine
,
it
suit
him
to
shine
at
the
cost
of
the
Court
rather
than
at
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Omnium
be
a
Whig
of
a
very
different
calibre
.
<EOS>
He
rarely
go
near
the
presence
of
majesty
,
and
when
he
do
do
so
,
he
do
it
merely
as
a
disagreeable
duty
incident
to
his
position
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
willing
that
the
Queen
should
be
queen
so
long
as
he
be
allow
to
be
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
nor
have
he
begrudge
<EOS>
Prince
Albert
any
of
his
honour
till
he
be
call
Prince
Consort
.
<EOS>
then
,
indeed
,
he
have
,
to
his
own
intimate
friend
,
make
some
remark
in
three
word
,
not
flattering
to
the
discretion
of
the
Prime
Minister
.
<EOS>
the
Queen
may
be
queen
so
long
as
he
be
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
Their
revenue
be
about
the
same
,
with
the
exception
,
that
the
duke
's
be
his
own
,
and
he
could
do
what
he
like
with
them
.
<EOS>
this
remembrance
do
not
unfrequently
present
itself
to
the
duke
's
mind
.
<EOS>
in
person
,
he
be
a
plain
,
thin
man
,
tall
,
but
undistinguished
in
appearance
,
except
that
there
be
a
gleam
of
pride
in
his
eye
which
seem
every
moment
to
be
say
,
"
I
be
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
unmarried
,
and
,
if
report
say
true
,
a
great
debauchee
;
but
if
so
he
have
always
keep
his
debauchery
decently
away
from
the
eye
of
the
world
,
and
be
not
,
therefore
,
open
to
that
loud
condemnation
which
should
fall
like
a
hailstorm
round
the
ear
of
some
more
open
sinner
.
  
<EOS>
why
these
two
mighty
noble
put
their
head
together
in
order
that
the
tailor
's
son
should
represent
Barchester
in
Parliament
,
I
can
not
explain
.
<EOS>
Mr
Moffat
,
be
,
as
have
be
say
,
Lord
de
Courcy
's
friend
;
and
it
may
be
that
Lord
de
Courcy
be
able
to
repay
the
duke
for
his
kindness
,
as
touch
Barchester
,
with
some
little
assistance
in
the
county
representation
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
arrival
be
that
of
the
Bishop
of
Barchester
;
a
meek
,
good
,
worthy
man
,
much
attach
to
his
wife
,
and
somewhat
addicted
to
his
ease
.
<EOS>
She
,
apparently
,
be
make
in
a
different
mould
,
and
by
her
energy
and
diligence
atone
for
any
want
in
those
quality
which
may
be
observe
in
the
bishop
himself
.
<EOS>
when
ask
his
opinion
,
his
lordship
would
generally
reply
by
say
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Proudie
and
<EOS>
I
think
so
and
so
.
<EOS>
"
but
before
that
opinion
be
give
,
Mrs
Proudie
would
take
up
the
tale
,
and
she
,
in
her
more
concise
manner
,
be
not
will
not
to
quote
the
bishop
as
have
at
all
assist
in
the
consideration
of
the
subject
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
know
in
Barsetshire
that
no
married
pair
consort
more
closely
or
more
tenderly
together
;
and
the
example
of
such
conjugal
affection
among
person
in
the
upper
class
be
worth
mention
,
as
it
be
believe
by
those
below
them
,
and
too
often
with
truth
,
that
the
sweet
bliss
of
connubial
reciprocity
be
not
so
common
as
it
should
be
among
the
magnate
of
the
earth
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
arrival
even
of
the
bishop
and
his
wife
do
not
make
the
place
cheerful
to
Frank
Gresham
,
and
he
begin
to
long
for
Miss
Dunstable
,
in
order
that
he
may
have
something
to
do
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
get
on
at
all
with
Mr
Moffat
.
<EOS>
He
have
expect
that
the
man
would
at
once
have
call
him
Frank
,
and
that
he
would
have
call
the
man
Gustavus
;
but
they
do
not
even
get
beyond
Mr
Moffat
and
Mr
Gresham
.
"
<EOS>
very
hot
in
Barchester
to
-
day
,
very
,
"
be
the
near
approach
to
conversation
which
Frank
could
attain
with
him
;
and
as
far
as
he
,
Frank
,
could
see
,
Augusta
never
get
much
beyond
it
.
<EOS>
there
may
be
_
tête
-
à
-
tête
_
meeting
between
them
,
but
,
if
so
,
Frank
could
not
detect
when
they
take
place
;
and
so
,
open
his
heart
at
last
to
the
honourable
George
,
for
the
want
of
a
well
confidant
,
he
express
his
opinion
that
his
future
brother
-
in
-
law
be
a
muff
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
muff
 
<EOS>
I
believe
you
too
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
now
?
<EOS>
I
have
be
with
him
and
Nearthewinde
in
Barchester
these
three
day
past
,
look
up
the
elector
"
wife
and
daughter
,
and
that
kind
of
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
if
there
be
any
fun
in
it
you
may
as
well
take
me
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
there
be
not
much
fun
;
they
be
mostly
so
slobbered
and
dirty
.
<EOS>
a
sharp
fellow
in
Nearthewinde
,
and
know
what
he
be
about
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
he
look
up
the
wife
and
daughter
too
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
he
go
on
every
tack
,
just
as
it
be
want
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
Moffat
,
yesterday
,
in
a
room
behind
the
milliner
's
shop
near
Cuthbert
's
Gate
;
I
be
with
him
.
<EOS>
the
woman
's
husband
be
one
of
the
chorister
and
an
elector
,
you
know
,
and
Moffat
go
to
look
for
his
vote
.
<EOS>
now
,
there
be
no
one
there
when
we
get
there
<EOS>
but
the
three
young
woman
,
the
wife
,
that
is
,
and
her
two
girl
 
very
pretty
woman
they
be
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
George
,
I
will
go
and
get
the
chorister
's
vote
for
Moffat
;
I
ought
to
do
it
as
he
be
to
be
my
brother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
do
you
think
Moffat
say
to
the
woman
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
can
not
guess
 
he
do
not
kiss
any
of
them
,
do
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
kiss
any
of
them
?
<EOS>
no
<EOS>
;
but
he
beg
to
give
them
his
positive
assurance
as
a
gentleman
,
that
if
he
be
return
to
Parliament
he
would
vote
for
an
extension
of
the
franchise
,
and
the
admission
of
the
Jews
into
Parliament
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
he
be
a
muff
!
"
say
Frank
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Dunstable
 
<EOS>
at
last
the
great
Miss
Dunstable
come
.
<EOS>
Frank
,
when
he
hear
that
the
heiress
have
arrive
,
feel
some
slight
palpitation
at
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
the
remote
idea
in
the
world
of
marry
her
;
indeed
,
during
the
last
week
past
,
absence
have
so
heighten
his
love
for
Mary
Thorne
that
he
be
<EOS>
more
than
ever
resolve
that
he
would
never
marry
any
one
but
her
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
have
make
her
a
formal
offer
for
her
hand
,
and
that
it
behove
him
to
keep
to
it
,
let
the
charm
of
Miss
Dunstable
be
what
they
may
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
be
prepared
to
go
through
a
certain
amount
of
courtship
,
in
obedience
to
his
aunt
's
behest
,
and
he
feel
a
little
nervous
at
be
bring
up
in
that
way
,
face
to
face
,
to
do
battle
with
two
hundred
thousand
pound
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Dunstable
have
arrive
,
"
say
his
aunt
to
him
,
with
great
complacency
,
on
his
return
from
an
electioneer
visit
to
the
beauty
of
Barchester
which
he
make
with
his
cousin
George
on
the
day
after
the
conversation
which
be
repeat
at
the
end
of
the
last
chapter
.
<EOS>
"
She
have
arrive
,
and
be
look
remarkably
well
;
she
have
quite
a
_
distingué
_
air
,
and
will
grace
any
circle
to
which
she
may
be
introduce
.
<EOS>
I
will
introduce
you
before
dinner
,
and
you
can
take
her
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
propose
to
her
to
-
night
,
I
suppose
?
"
say
Frank
,
maliciously
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
talk
nonsense
,
Frank
,
"
say
the
countess
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
do
what
I
can
for
you
,
and
take
on
an
infinity
of
trouble
to
endeavour
to
place
you
in
an
independent
position
;
and
now
you
talk
nonsense
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
mutter
some
sort
of
apology
,
and
then
go
to
prepare
himself
for
the
encounter
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Dunstable
,
though
she
have
come
by
train
,
have
bring
with
her
her
own
carriage
,
her
own
horse
,
her
own
coachman
and
footman
,
and
her
own
maid
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
She
have
also
bring
with
her
half
a
score
of
trunk
,
full
of
wear
apparel
;
some
of
them
nearly
as
rich
as
that
wonderful
box
which
be
steal
a
short
time
since
from
the
top
of
a
cab
.
<EOS>
but
she
bring
all
these
thing
,
not
in
the
least
because
she
want
them
herself
,
but
because
she
have
be
instruct
to
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
be
a
little
more
than
ordinarily
careful
in
dressing
.
<EOS>
He
spoil
a
couple
of
white
necktie
before
he
be
satisfied
,
and
be
rather
fastidious
as
the
set
of
his
hair
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
much
of
the
dandy
about
him
in
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
;
but
he
feel
that
it
be
incumbent
on
him
to
look
his
good
,
see
what
it
be
expect
that
he
should
now
do
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
do
not
mean
to
marry
Miss
Dunstable
;
but
as
he
be
to
have
a
flirtation
with
her
,
it
be
well
that
he
should
do
so
under
the
good
possible
auspex
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
enter
the
drawing
-
room
he
perceive
at
once
that
the
lady
be
there
.
<EOS>
She
be
seat
between
the
countess
and
Mrs
Proudie
;
and
mammon
,
in
her
person
,
be
receive
worship
from
the
temporality
and
spirituality
of
the

He
try
to
look
unconcerned
,
and
remain
in
the
farth
part
of
the
room
,
talk
with
some
of
his
cousin
;
but
he
could
not
keep
his
eye
off
the
future
possible
Mrs
Frank
Gresham
;
and
it
seem
as
though
she
be
as
much
constrain
to
scrutinise
him
as
he
feel
to
scrutinise
her
.
  
<EOS>
Lady

Courcy
have
declare
that
she
be
look
extremely
well
,
and
have
particularly
allude
to
her
_
distingué

appearance
.
<EOS>
Frank
at
once
feel
that
he
could
not
altogether
go
along
with
his
aunt
in
this
opinion
.
<EOS>
Miss
Dunstable
may
be
very
well
;
but
her
style
of
beauty
be
one
which
do
not
quite
meet
with
his
warm
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
in
age
she
be
about
thirty
;
but
Frank
,
who
be
no
great
judge
in
these
matter
,
and
who
be
accustomed
to
have
very
young
girl
round
him
,
at
once
put
her
down
as
be
ten
year
old
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
very
high
colour
,
very
red
cheek
,
a
large
mouth
,
big
white
tooth
,
a
broad
nose
,
and
bright
,
small
,
black
eye

<EOS>
Her
hair
also
be
black
and
bright
,
but
very
crisp
,
and
strong
,
and
be
comb
close
round
<EOS>
her
face
in
small
crisp
black
ringlet
.
<EOS>
since
she
have
be
bring
out
into
the
fashionable
world
some
one
of
her
instructor
in
fashion
have
give
her

understand
that

<EOS>
"

Miss

have
reply
,
"
when

up

It

Frank

the

<EOS>
Mrs

,
would
you
excuse
me
?
<EOS>
I
must
positively
go

a

word
to
Mrs

huffed

<EOS>
so

,
she
move
off

leave

<EOS>
He

course
slip
into
his

and
express
a
hope
that
Miss

be
not
fatigue
by
her
journey

<EOS>
"
fatigue
!
"
<EOS>
say
she
,
in
a
voice
rather
loud
,
but
very
good
-
humoured
,
and
not
altogether
unpleasing
;
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
to
be
fatigue
by
such
a
thing
as
that
.
<EOS>
why
,
in
May
we
come
through
all
the
way
from
Rome
to
Paris
without
sleep
 
that
is
,
without
sleep
in

we
be
upset
three

out

come
over
the
Simplon
.
<EOS>
It
be
such
fun
!
<EOS>
why

I

tired
even
then

<EOS>
"
all

Mrs

in
a
tone
of
astonishment
,
mean
to
flatter
the
heiress

and
what
make
you
in
such
a
hurry
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
something
about
money
matter
,
"
say
Miss
Dunstable
,
speak
rather
louder
than
usual
.
<EOS>
"
something
to
do
with
the
ointment
.
<EOS>
I
be
sell
the
business
just
then

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs

bow
,
and
immediately
change
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
idolatry
be
,
I
believe
,
more
rampant
than
ever
in
Rome

"
say
she
;
"
and
I
fear
there
be
no
such
thing
at
all
as
Sabbath
observance

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
not
in
the

,
"
say
Miss
Dunstable

with
rather
a
joyous
air
;
"
sunday

week

all

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
very
frightful
!
"
say
Mrs
Proudie

<EOS>
"
but
it
be
a
delicious
place

<EOS>
I
do
like
Rome
,
I
must
say
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
the
Pope
,
if
he
be
not
quite
so
fat
he
would
be
the
nice
old
fellow
in
the
world

have
you
be
in
Rome
,
Mrs
Proudie
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Proudie
sigh
as
she
reply
in
the
negative
,
and
declare
her
belief
that
danger
be
to
be
apprehend
from
such
visit

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
 
ah
!
 
<EOS>
the
malaria
 
<EOS>
of

<EOS>
yes

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
think
of
the
soul
,
Miss
Dunstable
,
"
say
the
lady
-
bishop
,
in
her
peculiar
,
grave
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
place
where
there
be
no
Sabbath
observance
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
have
you
be
in
Rome
,
Mr
Gresham
?
"
say
the
young
lady
,
turn
almost
abruptly
round
to
Frank
,
and
give
a
somewhat
uncivilly
cold
shoulder
to
Mrs
Proudie
's
exhortation
.
<EOS>
She
,
poor
lady
,
be
force
to
finish
her
speech
to
the
honourable
George
,
who
be
stand
near
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
an
idea
that
bishop
and
all
their
belonging
,
like
other
thing
appertain
to
religion
,
should
,
if
possible
,
be
avoid
;
but
if
that
be
not
possible
,
should
be
treat
with
much
assume
gravity
,
immediately
put
on
a
long
face
,
and
remark
that
 
"
it
be
a
deuced
shame
:
for
his
part
he
always
like
to
see
people
go
quiet
on
Sundays
.
<EOS>
the
parson
have
only
one
day
out
of
seven
,
and
he
think
they
be
fully
entitle
to
that
.
"
<EOS>
satisfied
with
which
,
or
not
satisfied
,
Mrs
Proudie
have
to
remain
silent
till
dinner
-
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Frank
;
"
I
never
be
in
Rome
.
<EOS>
I
be
in
Paris
once
,
and
that
be
all
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
feel
a
not
unnatural
anxiety
as
to
the
present
state
of
Miss
Dunstable
's
worldly
concern
,
he
take
an
opportunity
of
fall
back
on
that
part
of
the
conversation
which
Mrs
Proudie
have
exercise
so
much
tact
in
avoid
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
be
it
sell
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
sell
!
<EOS>
what
sell
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
say
about
the
business
 
that
you
come
back
without
go
to
bed
because
of
sell
the
business

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
the
ointment
.
<EOS>
no
;
it
be
not
sell
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
the
affair
do
not
come
off
,
and
I
may
have
remain
and
have
another
roll
in
the
snow
.
<EOS>
be
not
it
a
pity
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
so
,
"
say
Frank
to
himself
,
"
if
I
should
do
it
,
I
should
be
owner
of
the
ointment
of
Lebanon
:
how
odd
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
give
her
his
arm
and
hand
her
down
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
He
certainly
find
that
the
dinner
be
less
dull
than
any
other
he
have
sit
down
to
at
Courcy
Castle
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
fancy
that
he
should
ever
fall
in
love
with
Miss
Dunstable
;
but
she
certainly
be
an
agreeable
companion
.
<EOS>
She
tell
him
of
her
tour
,
and
the
fun
she
have
in
her
journey
;
how
she
take
a
physician
with
her
for
the
benefit
of
her
health
,
whom
she
generally
be
force
to
nurse
;
of
the
trouble
it
be
to
her
to
look
after
and
wait
upon
her
numerous
servant
;
of
the
trick
she
play
to
bamboozle
people
who
come
to
stare
at
her
;
and
,
lastly
,
she
tell
him
of
a
lover
who
follow
her
from
country
to
country
,
and
be
now
in
hot
pursuit
of
her
,
have
arrive
in
London
the
evening
before
she
leave
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
lover
?
<EOS>
"
say
Frank
,
somewhat
startle
by
the
suddenness
of
the
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
lover
 
<EOS>
yes
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gresham
;
why
should
I
not
have
a
lover
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
no
 
of
course
not

<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
have
a
good
many
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
only
three

four

upon
my
word

that
is

only
three

four

I
favour

one
be
not
bind
to
reckon
the
other
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
they
would
be
too
numerous
.
<EOS>
and
so
you
have
three
whom
you
favour
,
Miss
Dunstable
;
"
and
Frank
sigh
,
as
though
he
intend
to
say
that
the
number
be
too
many
for
his
peace
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
not
that
quite
enough
?
<EOS>
but
of
course
I
change
them
sometimes
;
"
and
she
smile
on
him
very
good
-
naturedly
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
very
dull
if
I
be
always
to
keep
the
same
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
dull
indeed
,
"
say
Frank
,
who
do
not
quite
know
what
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
the
countess
would
mind
my
have
one
or
two
of
them
here
if
I
be
to
ask
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
sure
she
would
,
"
say
Frank
,
very
briskly
.
<EOS>
"
She
would
not
approve
of
it
at
all
;
nor
should
i.
"
  
"
<EOS>
You
 
why
,
what
have
you
to
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
great
deal
 
so
much
so
that
I
positively
forbid
it
;
but
,
Miss
Dunstable
 
"
  
"
well
,
Mr
Gresham
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
contrive
to
make
up
for
the
deficiency
as
well
as
possible
,
if
you
will
permit
us
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
now
for
myself
 
"
  
"
well
,
for
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
at
this
moment
the
countess
gleam
her
accomplished
eye
round
the
table
,
and
Miss
Dunstable
rise
from
her
chair
as
Frank
be
prepare
his
attack
,
and
accompany
the
other
lady
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
His
aunt
,
as
she
pass
him
,
touch
his
arm
lightly
with
her
fan
,
so
lightly
that
the
action
be
perceive
by
no
one
else
.
<EOS>
but
Frank
well
understand
the
meaning
of
the
touch
,
and
appreciate
the
approbation
which
it
convey
.
<EOS>
He
merely
blush
,
however
,
at
his
own
dissimulation
;
for
he
feel
more
certain
that
ever
that
he
would
never
marry
Miss
Dunstable
,
and
he
feel
nearly
equally
sure
that
Miss
Dunstable
would
never
marry
him
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
de
Courcy
be
now
at
home
;
but
his
presence
do
not
add
much
hilarity
to
the
claret

cup
.
<EOS>
the
young
man
,
however
,
be
very
keen
about

and
Mr

who

most
sanguine
hope

<EOS>
"
I
have

Mr

Frank

speak
rather
low
as
he
look
at
the

I

<EOS>
the
idea

very
amusing

Mr

absolutely
flabbergast
by
such
imprudence
on

one
of

<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
sure

be

Frank

"
upon

I
think

legitimate

one

"
very
little

It
be
hard

now

there

well

I
be
there

he

oh
,
I
will
pay
for
them
if
Moffat
will
not

I
think
I
shall
keep
an
account
there
;
they
seem
to
have
good
glove

those
sort
of
thing

"
  
<EOS>
"
very
good
,
I
have
no
doubt

George

<EOS>
"
I
suppose
your
lordship
will
be
in
town
soon
after
the
meeting
of
Parliament
?

the
bishop

question
the
earl

"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
<EOS>
;
I
suppose
I
must
be
there

<EOS>
I
be
never
allow
to
remain
very
long
in
quiet
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
nuisance
;

it
be
too
late
to
think
of
that
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
men
in
high
place
,
my
lord
,
never
be
,
and
never
will
be

allow
to
consider
themselves
.
<EOS>
They
burn
their
torch
not
in
their
own
behalf
,
"
say
the
bishop
,
thinking
,
perhaps
,
as
much
of
himself
as
he
do
of
his
noble
friend
.
<EOS>
"
rest
and
quiet
be
the
comfort
of
those
who
have

content
to
remain
in
obscurity

<EOS>
"
perhaps
so
,
"

the
earl

finish
his
glass
of
claret
with
an
air
of
virtuous
resignation
.
"
<EOS>
perhaps
so
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
own
martyrdom
,
however
,
have
not
be
severe
,
for
the
rest
and
quiet
of
home
have
never
be
peculiarly
satisfactory
to
his
taste
.
<EOS>
soon
after
this
they
all
go
to
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
some
little
time
before
Frank
could
find
an
opportunity
of
recommence
his
allotted
task
with
Miss
Dunstable
.
<EOS>
She
get
into
conversation
with
the
bishop
and
some
other
people
,
and
,
except
that
he
take
her
teacup
and
nearly
manage
to
squeeze
one
of
her
finger
as
he
do
so
<EOS>
,
he
make
very
little
further
progress
till
towards
the
close
of
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
he
find
her
so
nearly
alone
as
to
admit
of
his
speak
to
her
in
his
low
confidential
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
manage
that
matter
with
my
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
matter
?
"
say
Miss
Dunstable
;
and
her
voice
be
not
low
,
nor
particularly
confidential
.
  
<EOS>
"
about
those
three

four
gentleman
whom
you
wish
to
invite
here
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
my
attendant
knight
!
<EOS>
no

indeed

you
give
me
such
very

you
say
something
about
my
not

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
I
do
;
I
really

up

"
<EOS>
Plenty
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
plenty
:
<EOS>
one
good
lance
in
the
olden

always
worth
more

a
score
of
ordinary
man

at

arm

you
talk
about
three

four

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
but
then
you
see
,
Mr
Gresham
,
I
have
never
yet
find
the
one
good
lance
 
at
least
,
not
good
enough
to
suit
my
idea
of
true
prowess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
what
could
Frank
do
but
declare
that
he
be
ready
to
lay
his
own
in
rest
,
now
and
always
in
her
behalf
?
<EOS>
His
aunt
have
be
quite
angry
with
him
,
and
have
think
that
he
turn
her
into
ridicule
,
when
he
speak
of
make
an
offer
to
her
guest
that
very
evening
;
and
yet
here
he
be
so
place
that
he
have
hardly
an
alternative
.
<EOS>
let
his
inward
resolution
to
abjure
the
heiress
be
ever
so
strong
,
he
be
now
in
a
position
which
allow
him
no
choice
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
even
Mary
Thorne
could
hardly
have
blame
him
for
say
,
that
so
far
as
his
own
prowess
go
,
it
be
quite
at
Miss
Dunstable
's
service
.
<EOS>
have
Mary
be
look
on
<EOS>
,
she
,
perhaps
,
may
have
think
that
he
could
have
do
so
with
less
of
that
look
of
devotion
which
he
throw
into
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Mr
Gresham
,
that
be
very
civil
 
<EOS>
very
civil
indeed
,
"
say
Miss
Dunstable
.
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
if
a
lady
want
a
true
knight
she
may
do
bad
than
trust
to
you
.
<EOS>
only
I
fear
that
your
courage
be
of
so
exalt
a
nature
that
you
would
be
ever
ready
to
do
battle
for
any
beauty
who
may
be
in
distress
 
or
,
indeed
,
who
may
not
.
<EOS>
You
could
never
confine
your
valour
to
the
protection
of
one
maiden
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
!
<EOS>
but
I
would
though
if
I
like
her
,
"
say
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
not
a
more
constant
fellow
in
the
world
than
I
be
in
that
way
 
you
try
me
,
Miss
Dunstable
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
when
young
lady
make
such
trial
as
that
,
they
sometimes
find
it
too
late
to
go
back
if
the
trial
do
not
succeed
,
Mr
Gresham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
of
course
there
be
always
some
risk
.
<EOS>
It
be
like
hunting
;
there
would
be
no
fun
if
there
be
no
danger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
if
you
get
a
tumble
one
day
you
can
retrieve
your
honour
the
next
;
but
a
poor
girl
,
if
she
once
trust
a
man
who
say
that
he
love
her
,
have
no
such
chance

<EOS>
for
myself
,
I
would
never

I
would
know
him
for
seven
year
at

<EOS>
"
seven
year
!

Frank
,
who
could
not
help
think
that
in
seven
year

time
Miss
Dunstable
would
be
almost
an
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
seven
day
be
enough
to
know
any
person

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
or
perhaps
seven
hour
<EOS>
;
eh
,
Mr
Gresham
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
seven
hour
 
<EOS>
well
,
perhaps
seven
hour
,
if
they
happen
to
be
a
good
deal
together
during
the
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
after
all
like
love
at
first
sight
,
be
there
,
Mr
Gresham
?
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
know
well
enough
that
she
be
quiz
him
,
and
could
not
resist
the
temptation
he
feel
to
be
revenge
on
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
it
be
very
pleasant
,
"
say
he
;
"
but
as
for
myself
,
I
have
never
experience
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
laugh
Miss
Dunstable
.
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
Mr
Gresham
,
I
like
you
amazingly
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
expect
to
meet
anybody
down
here
that
I
should
like
half
so
much
.
<EOS>
You
must
come
and
see
me
in
London
,
and
I
will
introduce
you
to
my
three
knight
,
"
and
so
say
,
she
move
away
and
fall
into
conversation
with
some
of
the
high
power
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
feel
himself
to
be
rather
snub
,
in
spite
of
the
strong
expression
which
Miss
Dunstable
have
make
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
quite
clear
to
him
that
she
do
not
take
him
for
a
boy
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
to
be
sure
,
avenge
on
her
for
that
by
take
her
for
a
middle
-
aged
woman
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
be
hardly
satisfied
with
himself
;
"
I
may
give
her
a
heartache
yet
,
"
say
he
to
himself
,
"
and
she
may
find
afterwards
that
she
be
leave
in
the
lurch
with
all
her
money
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
he
retire
,
solitary
,
into
a
far
part
of
the
room
,
and
begin
to
think
of
Mary
Thorne
.
<EOS>
as
he
do
so
,
and
as
his
eye
fall
upon
Miss
Dunstable
's
stiff
curl
,
he
almost
shudder
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
the
lady
retire
.
<EOS>
His
aunt
,
with
a
good
-
natured
smile
on
her
face
,
come
to
him
as
she
be
leave
the
room
,
the
last
of
the
bevy
,
and
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
,
lead
him
out
into
a
small
unoccupied
chamber
which
open
from
the
grand
saloon
.
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
Master
Frank
,
"
say
she
,
"
you
seem
to
be
lose
no
time
with
the
heiress

<EOS>
You
have
quite
make
an
impression
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
much
about
that

aunt

"
say
he
,
look
rather
sheepish
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
declare
you
have
;
but
,
Frank
,
my
dear
boy
,
you
should
not
precipitate
these
sort
of
thing
too
much
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
to
take
a
little
more
time
:
it
be
more
value
;
and
perhaps
,
you
know
,
on
the
whole
 
"
  
perhaps
Frank
may
know
;
but
it
be
clear
that
Lady
de
Courcy
do
not
:
at
any
rate
,
she
do
not
know
how
to
express
herself
.
<EOS>
have
she
say
out
her
mind
<EOS>
plainly
,
she
would
probably
have
speak
thus
:
"
I
want
you
to
make
love
to
Miss
Dunstable
,
certainly
;
or
at
any
rate
to
make
an
offer
to
her
;
but
you
need
not
make
a
show
of
yourself
and
of
her
,
too
,
by
do
it
so
openly
as
all
that
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
countess
,
however
,
do
not
want
to
reprimand
her
obedient
nephew
,
and
therefore
do
not
speak
out
her
thought
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
?
"
say
Frank
,
look
up
into
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
take
a
_
leetle
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
more
time
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
,
my
dear
boy
;
slow
and
sure
,
you
know
;
"
so
the
countess
again
pat
his
arm
and
go
away
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
old
fool
!
"
mutter
Frank
to
himself
,
as
he
return
to
the
room
where
the
man
be
still
stand
.
<EOS>
He
be
right
in
this
:
she
be
an
old
fool
,
or
she
would
have
see
that
there
be
no
chance
whatever
that
her
nephew
and
Miss
Dunstable
should
become
man
and
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
Frank
,
"
say
the
honourable
John
;
"
so
you
be
after
the
heiress
already
.

"
  
"
He
will
not
give
any
of
us
a
chance
,
"
say
the
honourable
George
.
<EOS>
"
if
he
go
on
in
that
way
she
will
be
Mrs
Gresham
before
a
month
be
over

<EOS>
but
,
Frank
,
what
will
she
say
of
your
manner
of
look
for
Barchester
vote
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Gresham
be
certainly
an
excellent
hand
at
canvass
,
"
say
Mr
Nearthewinde
;
"
only
a
little
too
open
in
his
manner
of
proceeding
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
get
that
chorister
for
you
at
any
rate

Frank

<EOS>
"
and
you
would
never
have
have
him
without
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
half
so
much
of
the
chorister
's
vote
as
that
of
Miss
Dunstable
,
"
say
the
honourable
George
:
"
that
be
the
interest
that
be
really
worth
look
after

<EOS>
"
  
"
but
,
surely
,
"
say
Mr
Moffat
,
"
<EOS>
Miss
Dunstable
have
no
property
in
Barchester
?
"
<EOS>
poor
man
!
<EOS>
his
heart
be
so
intent
on
his
election
that
he
have
not
a
moment
to
devote
to
the
claim
of
love
.
   
<EOS>
the
election
 
<EOS>
and
now
the
important
day
of
the
election
have
arrive
,
and
some
man
's
heart
beat
quickly
enough
.
<EOS>
to
be
or
not
to
a
member
of
the
British
Parliament
be
a
question
of
very
considerable
moment
in
a
man
's
mind
.
<EOS>
much
be
often
say
of
the
great
penalty
which
the
ambitious
pay
for
enjoy
this
honour
;
of
the
tremendous
expense
of
election
;
of
the
long
,
tedious
hour
of
unpaid
labour
:
of
the
weary
day
pass
in
the
House
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
the
prize
be
one
very
well
worth
the
price
pay
for
it
 
<EOS>
well
worth
any
price
that
can
be
pay
for
it
short
of
wade
through
dirt
and
dishonour
.
  
<EOS>
no
other
great
european
nation
have
anything
like
it
to
offer
to
the
ambition
of
its
citizen
;
for
in
no
other
great
country
of
Europe
,
not
even
in
those
which
be
free
,
have
the
popular
constitution
obtain
,
as
with
us
,
true
sovereignty
and
power
of
rule
.
<EOS>
here
it
be
so
;
and
when
a
man
lay
himself
out
to
be
a
member
of
Parliament
,
he
play
the
high
game
and
for
the
high
stake
which
the
country
afford
.
  
<EOS>
to
some
man
,
bear
silver
-
spoon
,
a
seat
in
Parliament
come
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
from
the
time
of
their
early
manhood
they
hardly
know
what
it
be
not
to
sit
there
;
and
the
honour
be
hardly
appreciate
,
be
too
much
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
as
a
rule
,
they
never
know
how
great
a
thing
it
be
to
be
in
Parliament
;
though
,
when
reverse
come
,
as
reverse
occasionally
will
come
,
they
fully
feel
how
dreadful
it
be
to
be
leave
out
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
man
aspire
to
be
member
,
or
to
those
who
have
be
once
fortunate
have
again
to
fight
the
battle
without
assurance
of
success
,
the
come
election
must
be
matter
of
dread
concern
.
<EOS>
oh
,
how
delightful
to
hear
that
the
long
-
talk
-
of
rival
have
decline
the
contest
,
and
that
the
course
be
clear
!
<EOS>
or
to
find
by
a
short
canvass
that
one
's
majority
be
safe
,
and
the
pleasure
of
crow
over
an
unlucky
,
friendless
foe
quite
secure
!
  
<EOS>
no
such
gratification
as
this
fill
the
bosom
of
Mr
Moffat
on
the
morning
of
the
Barchester
election

no

indefatigable
agent

Mr
Nearthewinde
.
<EOS>
It
be
admit
on
all
side
that
the
contest
would
be
a
very
close
one
;
and
Mr
Nearthewinde
would
not
do
more
than
<EOS>
assert
that
they
ought
to
win
unless
thing
go
very
wrong
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Nearthewinde
have
other
election
to
attend
to
,
and
have
not
be
remain
at
Courcy
Castle
ever
since
the
coming
of
Miss
Dunstable
:
but
he
have
be
there
,
and
at
Barchester
,
as
often
as
possible
,
and
Mr
Moffat
be
make
greatly
uneasy
by
reflect
how
very
high
the
bill
would
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
party
have
outdo
each
other
in
the
loudness
of
their
assertion
,
that
each
would
on
his
side
conduct
the
election
in
strict
conformity
to
law
.
<EOS>
there
be
to
be
no
bribery
.
<EOS>
bribery
!
<EOS>
who
,
indeed
,
in
these
day
would
dare
to
bribe
;
to
give
absolute
money
for
an
absolute
vote
,
and
pay
for
such
an
article
in
downright
palpable
sovereign
?
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
purity
be
much
too
rampant
for
that
,
and
the
mean
of
detection
too
well
understand
.
<EOS>
but
purity
be
to
be
carry
much
further
than
this
.
<EOS>
there
should
be
no
treating
;
no
hiring
of
two
hundred
voter
to
act
as
messenger
at
twenty
shilling
a
day
in
look
up
some
four
hundred
other
voter
;
no
band
be
to
be
pay
for
;
no
carriage
furnish
;
no
ribbon
supply
.
<EOS>
british
voter
be
to
vote
,
if
vote
they
would
,
for
the
love
and
respect
they
bear
to
their
choose
candidate
.
<EOS>
if
so
actuated
,
they
would
not
vote
,
they
may
stay
away
;
no
other
inducement
would
be
offer
.
  
<EOS>
so
much
be
say
loudly
 
very
loudly
 
by
each
party
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
Mr
Moffat
,
early
in
these
election
day
,
begin
to
have
some
misgiving
about
the
bill
.
<EOS>
the
proclaim
arrangement
have
be
one
exactly
suitable
to
his
taste
;
for
Mr
Moffat
love
his
money
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
in
whose
breast
the
ambition
of
be
great
in
the
world
,
and
of
join
himself
to
aristocratic
people
be
continually
at
war
with
the
great
cost
which
such
taste
occasion
.
<EOS>
His
last
election
have
not
be
a
cheap
triumph
.
<EOS>
in
one
way
or
another
money
have
be
drag
from
him
for
purpose
which
have
be
to
his
mind
unintelligible
;
and
when
,
about
the
middle
of
his
first
session
,
he
have
,
with
much
grumbling
,
settle
all
demand
,
he
have
question
with
himself
whether
his
whistle
be
worth
its
cost
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
therefore
a
great
stickler
for
purity
of
election
;
although
,
have
he
consider
the
matter
,
he
should
have
know
that
with
him
money
be
his
only
passport
into
that
Elysium
in
which
he
have
now
live
for
two
year
.
<EOS>
He
probably
do
not
consider
it
;
for
when
,
in
those
canvass
day
immediately
precede
the
election
,
he
have
see
that
all
the
beer
-
house
be
open
,
and
half
the
population
be
drunk
,
he
have
ask
Mr
Nearthewinde
whether
this
violation
of
the
treaty
be
take
place
only
on
the
part
of
his
opponent
,
and
whether
,
in
such
case
,
it
would
not
be
duly
notice
with
a
view
to
a
possible
future
petition
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Nearthewinde
assure
him
triumphantly
that
half
at
least
of
the
wallowing
swine
be
his
own
especial
friend
;
and
that
somewhat
more
than
half
of
the
publican
of
the
town
be
eagerly
engage
in
fight
his
,
Mr
Moffat
's
battle
.
<EOS>
Mr
Moffat
groan
,
and
would
have
expostulate
<EOS>
have
Mr
Nearthewinde
be
willing
to
hear
him
.
<EOS>
but
that
gentleman
's
service
have
be
put
into
requisition
by
Lord
de
Courcy
rather
than
by
the
candidate
.
<EOS>
for
the
candidate
he
care
but
little
.
<EOS>
to
pay
the
bill
would
be
enough
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
,
Mr
Nearthewinde
,
be
do
his
business
as
he
well
know
how
to
do
it
;
and
it
be
not
likely
that
he
should
submit
to
be
lecture
by
such
as
Mr
Moffat
on
a
trumpery
score
of
expense
.
  
<EOS>
It
certainly
do
appear
on
the
morning
of
the
election
as
though
some
great
change
have
be
make
in
that
resolution
of
the
candidate
to
be
very
pure
.
<EOS>
from
an
early
hour
rough
band
of
music
be
to
be
hear
in
every
part
of
the
usually
quiet
town
;
cart
and
gig
,
omnibus
and
flys
,
all
the
old
carriage
from
all
the
inn
-
yards
,
and
every
vehicle
of
any
description
which
could
be
press
into
the
service
be
in
motion
;
if
the
horse
and
post
-
boy
be
not
to
be
pay
for
by
the
candidate
,
the
voter
themselves
be
certainly
very
liberal
in
their
mode
of
bring
themselves
to
the
poll
.
<EOS>
the
election
district
of
the
city
of
Barchester
extend
for
some
mile
on
each
side
of
the
city
,
so
that
the
omnibus
and
flys
have
enough
to
do
.
<EOS>
beer
be
to
be
have
at
the
public
-
house
,
almost
without
question
,
by
all
who
choose
to
ask
for
it
;
and
rum
and
brandy
be
dispense
to
select
circle
within
the
bar
with
equal
profusion
.
<EOS>
as
for
ribbon
,
the
mercer
"
shop
must
have
be
empty
of
that
article
,
as
far
as
scarlet
and
yellow
be
concern
.
<EOS>
Scarlet
be
Sir
Roger
's
colour
,
while
the
friend
of
Mr
Moffat
be
deck
with
yellow
.
<EOS>
see
what
he
do
see
,
Mr
Moffat
may
well
ask
whether
there
have
not
be
a
violation
of
the
treaty
of
purity
!
  
<EOS>
at
the
time
of
this
election
there
be
some
question
whether
England
should
go
to
war
with
all
her
energy
;
or
whether
it
would
not
be
well
for
her
to
save
her
breath
to
cool
her
porridge
,
and
not
meddle
more
than
could
be
help
with
foreign
quarrel
.
<EOS>
the
last
view
of
the
matter
be
advocate
by
Sir
Roger
,
and
his
motto
of
course
proclaim
the
merit
of
domestic
peace
and
quiet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
peace
abroad
and
a
big
loaf
at
home
,
"
be
consequently
display
on
four
or
five
huge
scarlet
banner
,
and
carry
wave
over
the
head
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
but
Mr
Moffat
be
a
staunch
supporter
of
the
Government
,
who
be
already
incline
to
be
belligerent
,
and
<EOS>
"
England
's
honour
"
be
therefore
the
legend
under
which
he
select
to
do
battle
.
<EOS>
It
may
,
however
,
be
doubt
whether
there
be
in
all
Barchester
one
inhabitant
 
<EOS>
let
alone
one
elector
 
so
fatuous
as
to
suppose
that
England
's
honour
be
in
any
special
manner
dear
to
Mr
Moffat
;
or
that
he
would
be
a
whit
more
sure
of
a
big
loaf
than
he
be
now
,
should
Sir
Roger
happily
become
a
member
of
the
legislature
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
the
fine
art
be
resort
to
,
see
that
language
fall
short
in
tell
all
that
be
find
necessary
to
be
tell
.
<EOS>
Poor
Sir
Roger
's
failing
as
regard
the
bottle
be
too
well
known
;
and
it
be
also
know
that
,
in
acquire
his
title
,
he
have
not
quite
lay
aside
the
rough
mode
of
speech
which
he
have
use
in
his
early
year
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
consequently
,
a
great
daub
paint
up
on
sundry
wall
,
on
which
a
navvy
,
with
a
pimply
,
bloated
face
,
be
to
be
see
stand
on
a
railway
bank
,
lean
on
a
spade
hold
a
bottle
in
one
hand
,
while
he
invite
a
comrade
to
drink
.
"
<EOS>
come
,
Jack
,
shall
us
have
a
drop
of
some'at
short
?
"
<EOS>
be
the
word
come
out
of
the
navvy
's
mouth
;
and
under
this
be
paint
in
huge
letter
,
  
"
the
last
new
baronet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
Mr
Moffat
hardly
escape
on
easy
term
.
<EOS>
the
trade
by
which
his
father
have
make
his
money
be
as
well
know
as
that
of
the
railway
contractor
;
and
every
possible
symbol
of
tailordom
be
display
in
graphic
portraiture
on
the
wall
and
hoarding
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
He
be
draw
with
his
goose
,
with
his
scissor
,
with
his
needle
,
with
his
tape
;
he
may
be
see
measure
,
cutting
,
stitching
,
press
,
carry
home
his
bundle
,
and
present
his
little
bill
;
and
under
each
of
these
representation
be
repeat
his
own
motto
:
"
England
's
honour
.
"
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
pleasant
little
amenity
with
which
the
people
of
Barchester
greet
the
two
candidate
who
be
desirous
of
the
honour
of
serve
them
in
Parliament
.
  
<EOS>
the
polling
go
on
briskly
and
merrily
.
<EOS>
there
be
somewhat
above
nine
hundred
register
voter
,
of
whom
the
great
portion
record
their
vote
early
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
at
two
o'clock
,
accord
to
Sir
Roger
's
committee
,
the
number
be
as
follow
:
    
Scatcherd
275
Moffat
268
  
<EOS>
whereas
,
by
the
light
afford
by
Mr
Moffat
's
people
,
they
stand
in
a
slightly
different
ratio
to
each
other
,
be
write
thus
:
    
<EOS>
Moffat
277
Scatcherd
269
  
<EOS>
this
naturally
heighten
the
excitement
,
and
give
additional
delight
to
the
proceeding
.
<EOS>
at
half
-
past
two
it
be
agree
by
both
side
that
Mr
Moffat
be
ahead
;
the
Moffatites
claim
a
majority
of
twelve
,
and
the
Scatcherdites
allow
a
majority
of
one
.
<EOS>
but
by
three
o'clock
sundry
good
man
and
true
,
belong
to
the
railway
interest
,
have
make
their
way
to
the
booth
in
spite
of
the
effort
of
a
band
of
rough
from
Courcy
,
and
Sir
Roger
be
again
lead
,
by
ten
or
a
dozen
,
accord
to
his
own
showing
.
  
<EOS>
one
little
transaction
which
take
place
in
the
early
part
of
the
day
deserve
to
be
record
.
<EOS>
there
be
in
Barchester
an
honest
publican
 
honest
as
the
world
of
publican
go
 
who
not
only
be
possess
of
a
vote
,
but
possess
also
of
a
son
who
be
a
voter
.
<EOS>
He
be
one
Reddypalm
,
and
in
former
day
,
before
he
have
learn
to
appreciate
the
full
value
of
an
Englishman
's
franchise
,
he
have
be
a
declare
Liberal
and
an
early
friend
of
Roger
Scatcherd
's
.
<EOS>
in
latter
day
he
have
govern
his
political
feeling
with
more
decorum
,
and
have
not
allow
himself
to
be
carry
away
by
such
foolish
fervour
as
he
have
evince
in
his
youth
.
<EOS>
on
this
special
occasion
,
however
,
his
line
of
conduct
be
so
mysterious
as
for
a
while
to
baffle
even
those
who
know
him
best
.
  
<EOS>
His
house
be
apparently
open
in
Sir
Roger
's
interest
.
<EOS>
beer
,
at
any
rate
,
be
flow
there
as
elsewhere
;
and
scarlet
ribbon
go
in
 
not
,
perhaps
,
in
a
state
of
perfect
steadiness
 
come
out
more
unsteady
than
before
.
<EOS>
still
have
Mr
Reddypalm
be
deaf
to
the
voice
of
that
charmer
,
Closerstil
,
though
he
have
charm
with
all
his
wisdom
.
<EOS>
Mr
Reddypalm
have
state
,
first
his
unwillingness
to
vote
at
all
:
 
he
have
,
he
say
,
give
over
politic
,
and
be
not
incline
to
trouble
his
mind
again
with
the
subject
;
then
he
have
speak
of
his
great
devotion
to
the
Duke
of
Omnium
,
under
whose
grandfather
his
grandfather
have
be
breed
:
Mr
Nearthewinde
have
,
as
he
say
,
be
with
him
,
and
prove
to
him
beyond
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
it
would
show
the
deep
ingratitude
on
his
part
to
vote
against
the
duke
's
candidate
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Closerstil
think
he
understand
all
this
,
and
send
more
,
and
still
more
man
to
drink
beer
.
<EOS>
He
even
cause
 
take
infinite
trouble
to
secure
secrecy
in
the
matter
 
three
gallon
of
british
brandy
to
be
order
and
pay
for
as
the
good
french
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
Mr
Reddypalm
make
no
sign
to
show
that
he
consider
that
the
right
thing
have
be
do
.
<EOS>
on
the
evening
before
the
election
,
he
tell
one
of
Mr
Closerstil
's
confidential
man
,
that
he
have
think
a
good
deal
about
it
,
and
that
he
believe
he
should
be
constrain
by
his
conscience
to
vote
for
Mr
Moffat
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
say
that
Mr
Closerstil
be
accompany
by
a
learned
friend
of
his
,
one
Mr
Romer
,
a
barrister
,
who
be
greatly
interested
in
Sir
Roger
,
and
who
,
be
a
strong
Liberal
,
be
assist
in
the
canvass
with
much
energy
.
<EOS>
He
,
hear
how
matter
be
likely
to
go
with
this
conscientious
publican
,
and
feel
himself
peculiarly
capable
of
deal
with
such
delicate
scruple
,
undertake
to
look
into
the
case
in
hand
.
<EOS>
early
,
therefore
,
on
the
morning
of
the
election
,
he
saunter
down
the
cross
street
in
which
hang
out
the
sign
of
the
Brown
Bear
,
and
,
as
he
expect
,
find
Mr
Reddypalm
near
his
own
door
.
  
<EOS>
now
it
be
quite
an
understand
thing
that
there
be
to
be
no
bribery
.
<EOS>
this
be
understand
by
no
one
well
than
by
Mr
Romer
,
who
have
,
in
truth
,
draw
up
many
of
the
publish
assurance
to
that
effect
.
<EOS>
and
,
to
give
him
his
due
,
he
be
fully
minded
to
act
in
accordance
with
these
assurance
.
<EOS>
the
object
of
all
the
party
be
to
make
it
worth
the
voter
"
while
to
give
their
vote
;
but
to
do
so
without
bribery
.
<EOS>
Mr
Romer
have
repeatedly
declare
that
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
any
illegal
practising
;
but
he
have
also
declare
that
,
as
long
as
all
be
do
accord
to
law
,
he
be
ready
to
lend
his
good
effort
to
assist
Sir
Roger
.
<EOS>
how
he
assist
Sir
Roger
,
and
adhere
to
the
law
,
will
now
be
see
.
  
<EOS>
oh
,
Mr
Romer
!
<EOS>
Mr
Romer
!
<EOS>
be
it
not
the
case
with
thee
that
thou
"
wouldst
not
play
false
,
and
yet
wouldst
wrongly
win
?
<EOS>
"
not
in
electioneering
,
Mr
Romer
,
any
more
than
in
other
pursuit
,
can
a
man
touch
pitch
and
not
be
defile
;
as
thou
,
innocent
as
thou
art
,
wilt
soon
learn
to
thy
terrible
cost
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Reddypalm
,
"
say
Mr
Romer
,
shake
hand
with
him
.
<EOS>
Mr
Romer
have
not
be
equally
cautious
as
Nearthewinde
,
and
have
already
drunk
sundry
glass
of
ale
at
the
Brown
Bear
,
in
the
hope
of

how

I

all
I
look
to

Mr

be
sell
a

sell
it

yes

come

Reddypalm

such

Sir

you
be

a

he
speak

wonder
how
you
can
hesitate
about
it

now
with
another
man

I
should
think
that
he
want
to
be
pay
for
vote

oh

Mr

I
know
it

It
would
be
an

offer
you
money

even
if
money

I

Mr

if

you
will
hurt
me

<EOS>
I
know
the
value
of
an
Englishman

franchise
too
well
to
wish
to
sell
it

<EOS>
I
would

I
would

be

aware

I

I
do

two

bring
a

down

stand
here
 
it
be
not
Sir

when

down

when
I
draw
two

three

of
ale
on

when

only
half

I
do
say
that
I

no

no

I
will
,
Mr

<EOS>
Mr

could
not
but
acknowledge
that
this
be
a
natural
feeling
on

part
of
an
ordinary
mortal
publican
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
go
agin
the
grain
with
a
man
not
to
have
his
little
bill
pay

specially
at
election
time
,
"
again
urge
Mr
Reddypalm
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Romer
have
not
much
time
to
think
about
it
;
but
he
know
well
that
matter
be
so
nearly
balance
,
that
the
vote
of
Mr
Reddypalm
and
his
son
be
of
inestimable
value
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
only
about
your
bill

say
Mr

"
I
will
see

I
will
speak

"
  
<EOS>
"
all
right

"
say
Reddypalm
,
seize
the
young
barrister
's
hand
,
and
shake
it
warmly
;
"
all
right
!
"
<EOS>
and
late
in
the
afternoon
when
a
vote
or
two
become
matter
of
intense
interest
,
Mr
Reddypalm
and
his
son
come
up
to
the
husting
and
boldly
tender
theirs
for
their
old
friend
,
Sir
Roger
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
deal
of
eloquence
hear
in
Barchester
on
that
day
.
<EOS>
Sir
Roger
have
by
this
time
so
far
recover
as
to
be
able
to
go
through
the
dreadfully
hard
work
of
canvass
and
address
the
elector
from
eight
in
the
morning
till
near
sunset
.
<EOS>
a
very
perfect
recovery
,
most
man
will
say
.
<EOS>
yes
;
a
perfect
recovery
as
regard
the
temporary
use
of
his
faculty
,
both
physical
and
mental
;
though
it
may
be
doubt
whether
there
can
be
any
permanent
recovery
from
such
disease
as
his
.
<EOS>
what
amount
of
brandy
he
consume
to
enable
him
to
perform
this
election
work
,
and
what
lurk
evil
effect
the
excitement
may
have
on
him
 
of
these
matter
<EOS>
no
record
be
keep
in
the
history
of
those
proceeding
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Roger
's
eloquence
be
of
a
rough
kind
;
but
not
perhaps
the
less
operative
on
those
for
whom
it
be
intend
.
<EOS>
the
aristocracy
of
Barchester
consist
chiefly
of
clerical
dignitary
,
bishop
,
dean
,
prebendary
,
and
such
like
:
on
them
and
theirs
it
be
not
probable
that
anything
say
by
Sir
Roger
would
have
much
effect
.
<EOS>
those
man
would
either
abstain
from
voting
,
or
vote
for
the
railway
hero
,
with
the
view
of
keep
out
the
de
Courcy
candidate
.
<EOS>
then
come
the
shopkeeper
,
who
may
also
be
regard
as
a
stiff
-
necked
generation
,
impervious
to
electioneer
eloquence
.
<EOS>
They
would
,
generally
,
support
Mr
Moffat
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
an
inferior
class
of
voter
,
ten
-
pound
freeholder
,
and
such
like
,
who
,
at
this
period
,
be
somewhat
give
to
have
an
opinion
of
their
own
,
and
over
them
it
be
suppose
that
Sir
Roger
do
obtain
some
power
by
his
gift
of
talk
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
gentleman
,
will
you
tell
me
this
,
"
say
he
,
bawl
at
the
top
of
his
voice
from
off
the
portico
which
grace
the
door
of
the
Dragon
of
Wantley
,
at
which
celebrate
<EOS>
inn
Sir
Roger
's
committee
sit
:
 
"
who
be
Mr
Moffat
,
and
what
have
he
do
for
us
?
<EOS>
there
have
be
some
picture

maker
about
the
town
this
week
past
.
<EOS>
the
Lord
know
who
they
be
;
I
do
not

<EOS>
these
clever
fellow
do
tell
you
who
I
be
,
and
what
I
have
do
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
very
proud
of
the
way
they
have
paint
me
,
though
there
be
something
about
it
<EOS>
I
be
not
ashamed
of
either

<EOS>

here
,

and
he
hold
up
on
one
side
of
him
one
of
the
great
daub
of
himself
 
<EOS>
"
just
hold
it
there
till
I
can
explain
it
,

and
he
hand
the
paper
to
one
of
his
friend

<EOS>
"
that
be
me

Sir
Roger

up
his
stick

to
the
pimply

nosed
representation

himself

like

together
with
a
dead
cat
which
be
fling
at
him
from
the
crowd
,
and
which
he
dexterously
parry
with
his
stick
,
be
the
answer
which
he
receive
to
this
exordium
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
he
,
quite
undismayed
by
this
little
missile
which
have
so
nearly
reach
him
:

that

look
here
;
this
brown
,
dirty

about

I
will
come
to
that
presently

<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
about
the
brandy
in
good
time

<EOS>
but
that
thing
in
my
left
hand
be
a
spade
.
<EOS>
now
,
I
never
handle
a
spade
,
and
never
could
;
but
,
boy
,
I
handle
a
chisel
and
mallet
;
and
many
a
hundred
block
of
stone
have
come
out
smooth
from
under
that
hand
;
"
and
Sir
Roger
lift
up
his
great
broad
palm
wide
open

<EOS>
"
so
you
do
,
Roger
,
and
well
we
mind
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
meaning
,
however
,
of
that
spade
be
to
show
that
I
make
the
railway
.
<EOS>
now
I
be
very
much
oblige
to
those
gentleman
over
at
the
White
Horse
for
put
up
this
picture
of

It

a
true

you
who
I

I
do
make
that
railway

I
have
make
thousand

for
that

railway

I
should
not

your
vote

,
when
next
February
come

I

now

will
you
tell

how
about
the
brandy

Roger

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh

yes

the
brandy
!
<EOS>
I
be
forget
that
and
the
little
speech
that
be
come
out
of
my
mouth
 
a
deal
short
speech
,
and
a
well
one
than
what
I
be

now

<EOS>
here
,
in
the
right
hand
you
see
a
brandy
bottle

<EOS>
well
,
boy
,
I
be
not
a
bit
ashamed
of
that
;
as
long
as
a
man
do
his
work

the
spade
show
that
 
it
be
only
fair
he
should
have
something
to
comfort
him

harder

no

keep
the
cold
from

let
's
have
a
drop
of
some'at
short
.

"
<EOS>
why
,
that
be
a
good
speech
too

<EOS>
when
I
do
drink
I
like
to
share
with
a

I
do

Mr

no

can
truly

I
have
never
stick
myself
up

no

stick
my

up

I
do
not

but
now
,
have
polish
off
this
bit
of
picture
,
let
me
ask
you
who
Mr
Moffat
be
?
<EOS>
there
be
picture
enough
about
him
,
too
;
though
Heaven
know
where
they
all
come
from
.
<EOS>
I
think
Sir
Edwin
Landseer
must
have
do
this
one
of
the
goose
;
it
be
so
deadly
natural
.
<EOS>
look
at
it
;
there
he
be
.
<EOS>
upon
my
word
,
whoever
do
that
ought
to
make
his
fortune
at
some
of
these
exhibition
.
<EOS>
here
he
be
again
,
with
a
big
pair
of
scissor
.
<EOS>
He
call
himself
"
England
's
honour
;
"
what
the
deuce
England
's
honour
have
to
do
with
tailor
,
I
can
not
tell
you
:
perhaps
Mr
Moffat
can
.
<EOS>
but
mind
you
,
my
friend
,
I
do
not
say
anything
against
tailor
:
<EOS>
some
of
you
be
tailor
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
we
be
,
"
say
a
little
squeak
voice
from
out
of
the
crowd
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
a
good
trade
it
be
.
<EOS>
when
I
first
know
Barchester
there
be
tailor
here
<EOS>
could
lick
any
stone
-
mason
in
the
trade
;
I
say
nothing
against
tailor
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
enough
for
a
man
to
be
a
tailor
unless
he
be
something
else
along
with
it
.
<EOS>
You
be
not
so
fond
of
tailor
that
you
will
send
one
up
to
Parliament
merely
because
he
be
a
tailor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
not
have
no
tailor
.
<EOS>
no
;
nor
yet
no
cabbaging

<EOS>
take
a
go
of
brandy
,
Roger
;
you
be
blow

<EOS>
"
no
,
I
be
not
blow
yet

<EOS>
I
have
a
deal
more
to
say
about
Mr
Moffat
before
I
shall
be
blow

<EOS>
what
have
he
do
to
entitle
him
to
come
here
before
you
and
ask
you
to
send
him
to
Parliament
?
<EOS>
why
;
he
be
not
even
a
tailor

<EOS>
I
wish
he
be
.
<EOS>
there
be
always
some
good
in
a
fellow
who
know
how
to
earn
his
own
bread
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
not
a
tailor
;
he
can
not
even
put
a
stitch
in
towards
mend
England
's
honour
.
<EOS>
His
father
be
a
tailor
;
not
a
Barchester
tailor
,
mind
you
,
so
as
to
give
him
any
claim
on
your
affection
;
but
a
London
tailor
.
<EOS>
now
the
question
be
,
do
you
want
to
send
the
son
of
a
London
tailor
up
to
Parliament
to
represent
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
we
do
not
;
nor
yet
we
will
not
either
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
rather
think
not
.
<EOS>
You
have
have
him
once
,
and
what
have
he
do
for
you
?
<EOS>
have
he
say
much
for
you
in
the
House
of
Commons
?
<EOS>
why
,
he
be
so
dumb
<EOS>
a
dog
that
he
can
not
bark
even
for
a
bone
.
<EOS>
I
be
tell
it
be
quite
painful
to
hear
him
fumble
and
mumble
and
try
to
get
up
a
speech
there
over
at
the
White
Horse
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
belong
to
the
city
;
he
have
not
do
anything
for
the
city
;
and
he
have
not
the
power
to
do
anything
for
the
city
.
<EOS>
then
,
why
on
earth
do
he
come
here
?
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
de
Courcy
bring
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
marry
the
Earl
de
Courcy
's
niece
;
for
they
say
he
be
very
rich
 
<EOS>
this
tailor
's
son
 
<EOS>
only
they
do
say
also
that
he
do
not
much
like
to
spend
his
money
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
marry
Lord
de
Courcy
's
niece
,
and
Lord
de
Courcy
wish
that
his
nephew
should
be
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
there
,
that
be
the
claim
which
Mr
Moffat
have
here
on
the
people
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
He
be
Lord
de
Courcy
's
nominee
,
and
those
who
feel
themselves
bind
hand
and
foot
,
heart
and
soul
,
to
Lord
de
Courcy
,
have
well
vote
for
him
.
<EOS>
such
man
have
my
leave
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
enough
of
such
at
Barchester
to
send
him
to
Parliament
,
the
city
in
which
I
be
bear
must
be
very
much
alter
since
I
be
a
young
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
finish
his
speech
,
Sir
Roger
retire
within
,
and
recruit
himself
in
the
usual
manner
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
flood
of
eloquence
at
the
Dragon
of
wantly
.
<EOS>
at
the
White
Horse
,
meanwhile
,
the
friend
of
the
de
Courcy
interest
be
treat
perhaps
to
sounder
political
view
;
though
not
express
in
period
so
intelligibly
fluent
as
those
of
Sir
Roger
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Moffat
be
a
young
man
,
and
there
be
no
knowing
to
what
proficiency
in
the
Parliamentary
gift
of
public
talk
he
may
yet
attain
;
but
hitherto
his
proficiency
be
not
great
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
however
,
endeavour
to
make
up
by
study
for
any
want
of
readiness
of
speech
,
and
have
come
to
Barchester
daily
,
for
the
last
four
day
,
fortify
with
a
very
pretty
harangue
,
which
he
have
prepare
for
himself
in
the
solitude
of
his
chamber
.
<EOS>
on
the
three
previous
day
matter
have
be
allow
to
progress
with
tolerable
smoothness
,
and
he
have
be
permit
to
deliver
himself
of
his
elaborate
eloquence
with
few
other
interruption
than
those
occasion
by
his
own
want
of
practice
.
<EOS>
but
on
this
,
the
day
of
day
,
the
barchesterian
rough
be
not
so
complaisant
.
<EOS>
It
appear
to
Mr
Moffat
,
when
he
essay
to
speak
,
that
he
be
surround
by
enemy
rather
than
friend
;
and
in
his

he
give
great
blame
to
Mr

not

Mr

<EOS>
an

be
a

but
it
be
not
calculate
to

man
there

doubtless

Mr

<EOS>
as
the
insidious

he
feel
that
all
further

coax
the

,
by
word
flow
from

sweet

<EOS>
He
could
not

self

confident
,
energetic
,
witty
,
and
good

humoured
with
a
rotten

He

It
be

Mr

,
in

it

very
little
whether
Mr

<EOS>
four
o'clock

tremendous
exertion
have
be

half

emissary
send

to
prove
to
Mr

that
all
manner

advantage
would
accrue
to
the
Brown
Bear
if
it
should
turn
out
that
Mr

should
take
his
seat
for
Barchester
.
<EOS>
no
bribe
be
,
of
course

offer

even
hint
at

<EOS>
the
purity
of
Barchester
be
not
contaminate
during
the
day
by
one
such
curse
as
this
.
<EOS>
but
a
man
,
and
a
publican
,
would
be
require
to
do
some
great
deed
in
the
public
line
;
to
open
some
colossal
tap
;
to
draw
beer
for
the
million
;
and
no
one
would
be
so
fit
as
Mr
Reddypalm
 
<EOS>
if
only
it
may
turn
out
that
Mr
Moffat
should
,
in
the
come
February
,
take
his
seat
as
member
for
Barchester

<EOS>
but
Mr
Reddypalm
be
a
man
of
humble
desire
,
whose
ambition
soar
no
high
than
this
 
that
his
little
bill
should
be
duly
settle
.
<EOS>
It
be
wonderful
what
love
an
innkeeper
have
for
his
bill
in
its
entirety
.
<EOS>
an
account
,
with
a
respectable
total
of
five
or
six
pound
,
be
bring
to
you
,
and
you
complain
<EOS>
but
of
one
article
;
that
fire
in
the
bedroom
be
never
light
;
or
that
second
glass
of
brandy
and
water
be
never
call
for
.
<EOS>
You
desire
to
have
the
shilling
expunge
,
and
all
your
host
's
pleasure
in
the
whole
transaction
be
destroy
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
my
friend
,
pay
for
the
brandy
and
water
,
though
you
never
drink
it
;
suffer
the
fire
to
pass
,
though
it
never
warm
you
.
<EOS>
why
make
a
good
man
miserable
for
such
a
trifle
?
  
<EOS>
It
become
notify
to
reddypalm
with
sufficient
clearness
that
his
bill
for
the
past
election
should
be
pay
without
further
question
;
and
,
therefore
,
at
five
o'clock
the
Mayor
of
Barchester
proclaim
the
result
of
the
contest
in
the
follow
figure
:
    
Scatcherd
378
Moffat
376
  
<EOS>
Mr
Reddypalm
's
two
vote
have
decide
the
question
.
<EOS>
Mr
Nearthewinde
immediately
go
up
to
town
;
and
the
dinner
party
at
Courcy
Castle
that
evening
be
not
a
particularly
pleasant
meal
.
  
<EOS>
this
much
,
however
,
have
be
absolutely
decide
before
the
yellow
committee
conclude
their
labour
at
the
White
Horse
:
there
should
be
a
petition
.
<EOS>
Mr
Nearthewinde
have
not
be
asleep
,
and
already
know
something
of
the
manner
in
which
Mr
Reddypalm
's
mind
have
be
quiet
.
   
<EOS>
the
Rivals
 
<EOS>
the
intimacy
between
Frank
and
Miss
Dunstable
grow
and
prosper
.
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
,
it
prosper
as
an
intimacy
,
though
perhaps
hardly
as
a
love
affair
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
continue
succession
of
joke
between
them
,
which
no
one
else
in
the
castle
understand
;
but
the
very
fact
of
there
be
such
a
good
understanding
between
them
rather
stand
in
the
way
of
,
than
assist
,
that
consummation
which
the
countess
desire
.
<EOS>
People
,
when
they
be
in
love
with
each
other
,
or
even
when
they
pretend
to
be
,
do
not
generally
show
it
by
loud
laughter
.
<EOS>
nor
be
it
frequently
the
case
that
a
wife
with
two
hundred
thousand
pound
can
be
win
without
some
little
preliminary
despair
.
<EOS>
now
there
be
no
despair
at
all
about
Frank
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
de
Courcy
,
who
thoroughly
understand
that
portion
of
the
world
in
which
she
herself
live
,
see
that
thing
be
not
go
quite
as
they
should
do
,
and
give
much
and
repeat
advice
to
Frank
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
more
eager
in
do
this
,
because
she
imagine
Frank
have
do
what
he
could
to
obey
her
first
precept
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
turn
up
his
nose
at
Miss
Dunstable
's
curl
,
nor
find
fault
with
her
loud
voice
:
he
have
not
object
to
her
as
ugly
,
nor
even
show
any
dislike
to
her
age
.
<EOS>
a
young
man
who
have
be
so
amenable
to
reason
be
worthy
of
further
assistance
;
and
so
Lady
de
Courcy
do
what
she
could
to
assist
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Frank
,
my
dear
boy
,
"
she
would
say
,
"
you
be
a
little
too
noisy
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
for
myself
,
you
know
;
I
do
not
mind
it
.
<EOS>
but
Miss
Dunstable
would
like
it
better
if
you
be
a
little
more
quiet
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
she
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
say
Frank
,
look
demurely
up
into
the
countess
's
face
.
<EOS>
"
I
rather
think
she
like
fun
and
noise
,
and
that
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
You
know
she
be
not
very
quiet
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
ah
!
 
<EOS>
but
Frank
,
there
be
time
,
you
know
,
when
that
sort
of
thing
should
be
lay
aside
.
<EOS>
fun
,
as
you
call
it
,
be
all
very
well
in
its
place
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
no
one
like
it
better
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
not
the
way
to
show
admiration
.
<EOS>
young
lady
like
to
be
admire
;
and
if
you
will
be
a
little
more
soft
-
mannered
with
Miss
Dunstable
,
I
be
sure
you
will
find
it
will
answer
better
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
the
old
bird
teach
the
young
bird
how
to
fly
 
very
needlessly
 
for
in
this
matter
of
flying
,
Nature
give
her
own
lesson
thoroughly
;
and
the
duckling
will
take
the
water
,
even
though
the
maternal
hen
warn
them
against
the
perfidious
element
never
so
loudly
.
  
<EOS>
soon
after
this
,
Lady
de
Courcy
begin
to
be
not
very
well
pleased
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
She
take
it
into
her
head
that
Miss
Dunstable
be
sometimes
almost
inclined
to
laugh
at
her
;
and
on
one
or
two
occasion
it
almost
seem
as
though
Frank
be
join
Miss
Dunstable
in
do
so
.
<EOS>
the
fact
indeed
be
,
that
Miss
Dunstable
be
fond
of
fun
;
and
,
endow
as
she
be
with
all
the
privilege
which
two
hundred
thousand
pound
may
be
suppose
to
give
to
a
young
lady
,
do
not
very
much
care
at
whom
she
laugh
.
<EOS>
She
be
able
to
make
a
tolerably
correct
guess
at
Lady
de
Courcy
's
plan
towards
herself
;
but
she
do
not
for
a
moment
think
that
Frank
have
any
intention
of
further
his
aunt
's
view
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
therefore
,
not
at
all
ill
-
inclined
to
have
her
revenge
on
the
countess
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
very
fond
your
aunt
be
of
you
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
to
him
one
wet
morning
,
as
he
be
saunter
through
the
house
;
now
laugh
,
and
almost
romp
with
her
 
then
tease
his
sister
about
Mr
Moffat
 
and
then
bother
his
lady
-
cousin
out
of
all
their
propriety
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
very
!
"
say
Frank
:
"
<EOS>
she
be
a
dear
,
good
woman
,
be
my
Aunt
de
Courcy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
declare
she
take
more
notice
of
you
and
your
doing
than
of
any
of
your
cousin
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
they
be
not
jealous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
they
be
such
good
people

bless
me
,
they
would
never

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
so
much
young
than
they
be

that
I
suppose
she
think
you
want
more
of
her
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
that
be
it
.
<EOS>
You
see
she
be
fond
of
have
a
baby
to
nurse

<EOS>
"
tell
me
,
Mr
Gresham

to
you
last
night

<EOS>
I
know
we
have
be
misbehave
ourselves
dreadfully

It
be
all
your
fault

you
would
make
me
laugh
so

that
be
just
what
I

to
her

"
She

talk
about

then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
on
earth
should
she
talk
of
any

else
as
long
as
you

here

do
not
you

<EOS>
"
be
it

<EOS>
dear
me

how
kind

I
do
not

a

about
any

just
at

Lady

She

no

what
be
it

she
say
?
<EOS>
She
say
,
that
after
all
,
beauty
be
but
skin
deep
 
and
that
she
value
you
for
your
virtue
and
prudence
rather
than
your
good

"
  
<EOS>
"
virtue

!
<EOS>
She
say
I
be
prudent
and
virtuous
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
talk
of
my
beauty
?
<EOS>
that
be
so
kind
of
you
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
either
of
you
say
anything
about
other

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
other
matter
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
do
not

<EOS>
only
some
people

sometimes

rather
for
what
they
have
get
than
for
any
good
quality
belong
to
themselves
intrinsically
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
can
never
be
the
case
with
Miss
Dunstable
;
especially
not
at
Courcy
Castle
,
"
say
Frank
,
bow
easily
from
the
corner
of
the
sofa
over
which
he
be
lean
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
not
,
"
say
Miss
Dunstable
;
and
Frank
at
once
perceive
that
she
speak
in
a
tone
of
voice
differ
much
from
that
half
-
bantering
,
half
-
good
-
humoured
manner
that
be
customary
with
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of
course
not
:
any
such
idea
would
be
quite
out
of
the
question
with
Lady
de
Courcy
.
"
<EOS>
She
pause
for
a
moment
,
and
then
add
in
a
tone
different
again
,
and
unlike
any
that
he
have
yet
hear
from
her
:
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
,
at
any
rate
,
out
of
the
question
with
Mr
Frank
Gresham
 
of
that
I
be
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
ought
to
have
understand
her
,
and
have
appreciate
the
good
opinion
which
she
intend
to
convey
;
but
he
do
not
entirely
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
be
hardly
honest
himself
towards
her
;
and
he
could
not
at
first
perceive
that
she
intend
to
say
that
she
think
him
so
.
<EOS>
He
know
very
well
that
she
be
allude
to
her
own
huge
fortune
,
and
be
allude
also
to
the
fact
that
people
of
fashion
seek
her
because
of
it
;
but
he
do
not
know
that
she
intend
to
express
a
true
acquittal
as
regard
him
of
any
such
baseness
.
  
<EOS>
and
do
he
deserve
to
be
acquit
?
<EOS>
yes
,
upon
the
whole
he
do
;
 
to
be
acquit
of
that
special
sin
.
<EOS>
His
desire
to
make
Miss
Dunstable
temporarily
subject
to
his
sway
arise
,
not
from
a
hankering
after
her
fortune
,
but
from
an
ambition
to
get
the
well
of
a
contest
in
which
other
man
around
him
seem
to
be
fail
.
  
<EOS>
for
it
must
not
be
imagine
that
,
with
such
a
prize
to
be
struggle
for
,
all
other
stand
aloof
and
allow
him
to
have
his
own
way
with
the
heiress
,
undisputed
.
<EOS>
the
chance
of
a
wife
with
two
hundred
thousand
pound
be
a
godsend
which
come
in
a
man
's
life
too
seldom
to
be
neglect
,
let
that
chance
be
never
so
remote
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
be
the
heir
to
a
large
embarrassed
property
;
and
,
therefore
,
the
head
of
family
,
put
their
wisdom
together
,
have
think
it
most
meet
that
this
daughter
of
Plutus
should
,
if
possible
,
fall
to
his
lot
.
<EOS>
but
not
so
think
the
honourable
George
;
and
not
so
think
another
gentleman
who
be
at
that
time
an
inmate
of
Courcy
Castle
.
  
<EOS>
these
suitor
perhaps
somewhat
despise
their
young
rival
's
effort
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
they
have
sufficient
worldly
wisdom
to
know
that
so
important
a
crisis
of
life
be
not
settle
among
quip
and
joke
,
and
that
Frank
be
too
much
in
jest
to
be
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
but
be
that
as
it
may
,
his
love
-
making
do
not
stand
in
the
way
of
their
love
-
making
;
nor
his
hope
,
if
he
have
any
,
in
the
way
of
their
hope
.
  
<EOS>
the
honourable
George
have
discuss
the
matter
with
the
honourable
John
in
a
properly
fraternal
manner
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
John
have
also
an
eye
to
the
heiress
;
but
,
if
so
,
he
have
cede
his
view
to
his
brother
's
superior
claim
;
for
it
come
about
that
they
understand
each
other
very
well
,
and
John
favour
George
with
salutary
advice
on
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
to
be
do
at
all
,
it
should
be
do
very
sharp
,
"
say
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
sharp
as
you
like
,
"
say
George
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
the
fellow
to
be
study
three
month
in
what
attitude
<EOS>
I
will
fall
at
a
girl
's
foot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
:
<EOS>
and
when
you
be
there
you
must
not
take
three
month
more
to
study
how
you
will
get
up
again
.
<EOS>
if
you
do
it
at
all
,
you
must
do
it
sharp
,
"
repeat
John
,
put
great
stress
on
his
advice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
say
a
few
soft
word
to
her
already
,
and
she
do
not
seem
to
take
them
badly
,
"
say
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
no
chicken
,
you
know
,
"
remark
John
;
"
and
with
a
woman
like
that
,
beat
about
the
bush
never
do
any
good
.
<EOS>
the
chance
be
she
will
not
have
you
 
<EOS>
that
be
of
course
;
plum
like
that
do
not
fall
into
a
man
's
mouth
merely
for
shake
the
tree
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
possible
she
may
;
and
if
she
will
,
she
be
as
likely
to
take
you
to
-
day
as
this
day
six
month
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
you
I
would
write
her
a
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
write
her
a
letter
 
eh
?
"
say
George
,
who
do
not
altogether
dislike
the
advice
,
for
it
seem
to
take
from
his
shoulder
the
burden
of
prepare
a
spoken
address
.
<EOS>
though
he
be
so
glib
in
speak
about
the
farmer
"
daughter
,
he
feel
that
he
should
have
some
little
difficulty
in
make
know
his
passion
to
Miss
Dunstable
by
word
of
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
write
a
letter
.
<EOS>
if
she
will
take
you
at
all
,
she
will
take
you
that
way
;
half
the
match
go
be
make
up
by
write
letter
.
<EOS>
write
her
a
letter
and
get
it
put
on
her
dressing
-
table
.
"
<EOS>
George
say
that
he
would
,
and
so
he
do
.
  
<EOS>
George
speak
quite
truly
when
he
hint
that
he
have
say
a
few
soft
thing
to
Miss
Dunstable
.
<EOS>
Miss
Dunstable
,
however
,
be
accustomed
to
hear
soft
thing
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
carry
much
about
in
society
among
fashionable
people
since
,
on
the
settlement
of
her
father
's
will
,
she
have
be
pronounce
heiress
to
all
the
ointment
of
Lebanon
;
and
many
man
have
make
calculation
respect
her
similar
to
those
which
be
now
animate
the
brain
of
the
Honourable
George
de
Courcy
.
<EOS>
She
be
already
quite
accustomed
to
be
the
target
at
which
spendthrift
and
the
needy
rich
may
shoot
their
arrow
:
accustom
to
be
shoot
at
,
and
tolerably
accustomed
to
protect
herself
without
make
scene
in
the
world
,
or
reject
the
advantageous
establishment
offer
to
her
with
any
loud
expression
of
disdain
.
<EOS>
the
honourable
George
,
therefore
,
have
be
permit
to
say
soft
thing
very
much
as
a
matter
of
course
.
  
<EOS>
and
very
little
more
outward
fracas
arise
from
the
correspondence
which
follow
than
have
arise
from
the
soft
thing
so
say
.
<EOS>
George
write
the
letter
,
and
have
it
duly
convey
to
Miss
Dunstable
's
bed
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
Miss
Dunstable
duly
receive
it
,
and
have
her
answer
convey
back
discreetly
to
George
's
hand
.
<EOS>
the
correspondence
run
as
follow
:
    
Courcy
Castle
,
August
 
,
185
 
.
  
<EOS>
my
DEAREST
miss
dunstable
,
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
but
flatter
myself
that
you
must
have
perceive
from
my
manner
that
you
be
not
indifferent
to
me
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
indeed
,
you
be
not
.
<EOS>
I
may
truly
say
,
and
swear
[
these
last
strong
word
have
be
put
in
by
the
special
counsel
of
the
Honourable
John
]
,
that
if
ever
a
man
love
a
woman
truly
,
I
truly
love
you
.
<EOS>
You
may
think
it
very
odd
that
I
should
say
this
in
a
letter
instead
of
speak
it
out
before
your
face
;
but
your
power
of
raillery
be
so
great
[
"
touch
her
up
about
her
wit
"
have
be
the
advice
of
the
Honourable
John
]
that
I
be
all
but
afraid
to
encounter
them
.
<EOS>
dearest
,
dear
Martha
 
<EOS>
oh
do
not
blame
me
for
so
address
you
!
 
<EOS>
if
you
will
trust
your
happiness
to
me
you
shall
never
find
that
you
have
be
deceive
.
<EOS>
My
ambition
shall
be
to
make
you
shine
in
that
circle
which
you
be
so
well
qualified
to
adorn
,
and
to
see
you
firmly
fix
in
that
sphere
of
fashion
for
which
all
your
taste
adapt
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
may
safely
assert
 
and
I
do
assert
it
with
my
hand
on
my
heart
 
that
I
be
actuate
by
no
mercenary
motive
.
<EOS>
far
be
it
from
me
to
marry
any
woman
 
<EOS>
no
,
not
a
princess
 
on
account
of
her
money
.
<EOS>
no
marriage
can
be
happy
without
mutual
affection
;
and
I
do
fully
trust
 
no
,
not
trust
,
but
hope
 
that
there
may
be
such
between
you
and
me
,
dear
Miss
Dunstable
.
<EOS>
whatever
settlement
you
may
propose
,
I
should
accede
to
.
<EOS>
It
be
you
,
your
sweet
person
,
that
I
love
,
not
your
money
.
  
<EOS>
for
myself
,
I
need
not
remind
you
that
I
be
the
second
son
of
my
father
;
and
that
,
as
such
,
I
hold
no
inconsiderable
station
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
My
intention
be
to
get
into
Parliament
,
and
to
make
a
name
for
myself
,
if
I
can
,
among
those
who
shine
in
the
House
of
Commons
.
<EOS>
My
eld
brother
,
Lord
Porlock
,
be
,
you
be
aware
,
unmarried
;
and
we
all
fear
that
the
family
honour
be
not
likely
to
be
perpetuate
by
him
,
as
he
have
all
manner
of
troublesome
liaison
which
will
probably
prevent
his
settling
in
life
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
at
all
of
that
kind
in
my
way
.
<EOS>
It
will
indeed
be
a
delight
to
place
a
coronet
on
the
head
of
my
lovely
Martha
:
a
coronet
which
can
give
no
fresh
grace
to
her
,
but
which
will
be
so
much
adorn
by
her
wear
it
.
  
<EOS>
Dearest
Miss
Dunstable
,
I
shall
wait
with
the
utmost
impatience
for
your
answer
;
and
now
,
burn
with
hope
that
it
may
not
be
altogether
unfavourable
to
my
love
,
I
beg
permission
to
sign
myself
    
Your
own
most
devoted
,
  
GEORGE
DE
COURCY
.
  
<EOS>
the
ardent
lover
have
not
to
wait
long
for
an
answer
from
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
She
find
this
letter
on
her
toilet
-
table
one
night
as
she
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
the
next
morning
she
come
down
to
breakfast
and
meet
her
swain
with
the
most
unconcerned
air
in
the
world
;
so
much
so
that
he
begin
to
think
,
as
he
munch
his
toast
with
rather
a
shamefaced
look
,
that
the
letter
on
which
so
much
be
to
depend
have
not
yet
come
safely
to
hand
.
<EOS>
but
his
suspense
be
not
of
a
prolonged
duration
.
<EOS>
after
breakfast
,
as
be
his
will
not
,
he
go
out
to
the
stable
with
his
brother
and
Frank
Gresham
;
and
while
there
,
Miss
Dunstable
's
man
,
come
up
to
him
,
touch
his
hat
,
and
put
a
letter
into
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
,
who
know
the
man
,
glance
at
the
letter
and
look
at
his
cousin
;
but
he
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
however
,
a
little
jealous
,
and
feel
that
an
injury
be
do
to
him
by
any
correspondence
between
Miss
Dunstable
and
his
cousin
George
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Dunstable
's
reply
be
as
follow
;
and
it
may
be
remark
that
it
be
write
in
a
very
clear
and
well
-
pen
hand
,
and
one
which
certainly
do
not
betray
much
emotion
of
the
heart
:
    
my
dear
MR
DE
COURCY
,
  
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
say
that
I
have
not
perceive
from
your
manner
that
you
entertain
any
peculiar
feeling
towards
me
;
as
,
have
I
do
so
,
I
should
at
once
have
endeavour
to
put
an
end
to
them
.
<EOS>
I
be
much
flatter
by
the
way
in
which
you
speak
of
me
;
but
I
be
in
too
humble
a
position
to
return
your
affection
;
and
can
,
therefore
,
only
express
a
hope
that
you
may
be
soon
able
to
eradicate
it
from
your
bosom
.
<EOS>
a
letter
be
a
very
good
way
of
make
an
offer
,
and
as
such
I
do
not
think
it
at
all
odd
;
but
I
certainly
do
not
expect
such
an
honour
last
night
.
<EOS>
as
to
my
raillery
,
I
trust
it
have
never
yet
hurt
you
.
<EOS>
I
can
assure
you
it
never
shall
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
soon
have
a
worthy
ambition
than
that
to
which
you
allude
;
for
I
be
well
aware
that
no
attempt
will
ever
make
me
shine
anywhere
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
quite
sure
you
have
have
no
mercenary
motive
:
such
motive
in
marriage
be
very
base
,
and
quite
below
your
name
and
lineage
.
<EOS>
any
little
fortune
that
I
may
have
must
be
a
matter
of
indifference
to
one
who
look
forward
,
as
you
do
,
to
put
a
coronet
on
his
wife
's
brow
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
for
the
sake
of
the
family
,
I
trust
that
Lord
Porlock
,
in
spite
of
his
obstacle
,
may
live
to
do
the
same
for
a
wife
of
his
own
some
of
these
day
.
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
hear
that
there
be
nothing
to
interfere
with
your
own
prospect
of
domestic
felicity
.
  
<EOS>
sincerely
hope
that
you
may
be
perfectly
successful
in
your
proud
ambition
to
shine
in
Parliament
,
and
regret
extremely
that
I
can
not
share
that
ambition
with
you
,
I
beg
to
subscribe
myself
,
with
very
great
respect
,
    
<EOS>
Your
sincere
well
-
wisher
,
  
MARTHA
dunstable
.
  
<EOS>
the
honourable
George
,
with
that
modesty
which
so
well
become
him
,
accept
Miss
Dunstable
's
reply
as
a
final
answer
to
his
little
proposition
,
and
trouble
her
with
no
further
courtship
.
<EOS>
as
he
say
to
his
brother
John
,
no
harm
have
be
do
,
and
he
may
have
well
luck
next
time
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
an
inmate
of
Courcy
Castle
who
be
somewhat
more
pertinacious
in
his
search
after
love
and
wealth
.
<EOS>
this
be
no
other
than
Mr
Moffat
:
a
gentleman
whose
ambition
be
not
satisfy
by
the
care
of
his
Barchester
contest
,
or
the
possession
of
one
affiance
bride
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Moffat
be
,
as
we
have
say
,
a
man
of
wealth
;
but
we
all
know
,
from
the
lesson
of
early
youth
,
how
the
love
of
money
increase
and
gain
strength
by
its
own
success
.
<EOS>
nor
be
he
a
man
of
<EOS>
so
mean
a
spirit
as
to
be
satisfied
with
mere
wealth
.
<EOS>
He
desire
also
place
and
station
,
and
gracious
countenance
among
the
great
one
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
hence
have
come
his
adherence
to
the
de
Courcys
;
hence
his
seat
in
Parliament
;
and
hence
,
also
,
his
perhaps
ill
-
consider
match
with
Miss
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
but
that
the
privilege
of
matrimony
offer
opportunity
to
money
-
love
young
man
which
ought
not
to
be
lightly
abuse
.
<EOS>
too
many
young
man
marry
without
give
any
consideration
to
the
matter
whatever
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
they
be
indifferent
to
money
,
but
that
they
recklessly
miscalculate
their
own
value
,
and
omit
to
look
around
and
see
how
much
be
do
by
those
who
be
more
careful
.
<EOS>
a
man
can
be
young
but
once
,
and
,
except
in
case
of
a
special
interposition
of
Providence
,
can
marry
but
once
.
<EOS>
the
chance
once
throw
away
may
be
say
to
be
irrevocable
!
<EOS>
how
,
in
after
-
life
,
do
man
toil
and
turmoil
through
long
year
to
attain
some
prospect
of
doubtful
advancement
!
<EOS>
half
that
trouble
,
half
that
care
,
a
tithe
of
that
circumspection
would
,
in
early
youth
,
have
probably
secure
to
them
the
endure
comfort
of
a
wife
's
wealth
.
  
<EOS>
You
will
see
man
labour
night
and
day
to
become
bank
director
;
and
even
a
bank
direction
may
only
be
the
road
to
ruin
.
<EOS>
other
will
spend
year
in
degrade
subserviency
to
obtain
a
niche
in
a
will
;
and
the
niche
,
when
at
last
obtain
and
enjoy
,
be
but
a
sorry
payment
for
all
that
have
be
endure
.
<EOS>
other
,
again
,
struggle
harder
still
,
and
go
through
even
deep
water
:
they
make
will
for
themselves
,
forge
stock
-
share
,
and
fight
with
unremitting
,
painful
labour
to
appear
to
be
the
thing
that
they
be
not
.
<EOS>
now
,
in
many
of
these
case
,
all
this
may
have
be
spare
have
the
man
make
adequate
use
of
those
opportunity
which
youth
and
youthful
charm
afford
once
 
and
once
only
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
road
to
wealth
so
easy
and
respectable
as
that
of
matrimony
;
that
,
be
of
course
,
provide
that
the
aspirant
decline
the
slow
course
of
honest
work
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
we
can
so
seldom
put
old
head
on
young
shoulder
!
  
<EOS>
in
the
case
of
Mr
Moffat
,
we
may
perhaps
say
that
a
speciman
be
produce
of
this
bird
,
so
rare
in
the
land
.
<EOS>
His
shoulder
be
certainly
young
,
see
that
he
be
not
yet
six
-
and
-
twenty
;
but
his
head
have
ever
be
old
.
<EOS>
from
the
moment
when
he
be
first
put
forth
to
go
alone
 
at
the
age
of
twenty
-
one
 
<EOS>
his
life
have
be
one
calculation
how
he
could
make
the
most
of
himself
.
<EOS>
He
have
allow
himself
to
be
betray
into
no
folly
by
an
unguarded
heart
;
no
youthful
indiscretion
have
mar
his
prospect
.
<EOS>
He
have
make
the
most
of
himself
.
<EOS>
without
wit
,
or
depth
,
or
any
mental
gift
 
without
honesty
of
purpose
or
industry
for
good
work
 
he
have
be
for
two
year
sit
member
for
Barchester
;
be
the
guest
of
Lord
de
Courcy
;
be
engage
to
the
eld
daughter
of
one
of
the
good
commoner
'
family
in
England
;
and
be
,
when
he
first
begin
to
think
of
Miss
Dunstable
,
sanguine
that
his
re
-
election
to
Parliament
be
secure
.
  
<EOS>
when
,
however
,
at
this
period
he
begin
to
calculate
what
his
position
in
the
world
really
be
,
it
occur
to
him
that
he
be
do
an
ill
-
judge
thing
in
marry
Miss
Gresham
.
<EOS>
why
marry
a
penniless
girl
 
for
Augusta
's
trifle
of
a
fortune
be
not
a
penny
in
his
estimation
 
while
there
be
Miss
Dunstable
in
the
world
to
be
win
?
<EOS>
His
own
six
or
seven
thousand
<EOS>
a
year
,
quite
unembarrassed
as
it
be
,
be
certainly
a
great
thing
;
but
what
may
he
not
do
if
to
that
he
could
add
the
almost
fabulous
wealth
of
the
great
heiress
?
<EOS>
be
she
not
here
,
put
absolutely
in
his
path
?
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
a
wilful
throwing
away
of
a
chance
not
to
avail
himself
of
it
?
<EOS>
He
must
,
to
be
sure
,
lose
the
de
Courcy
friendship
;
but
if
he
should
then
have
secure
his
Barchester
seat
for
the
usual
term
of
parliamentary
session
,
he
may
be
able
to
spare
that
.
<EOS>
He
would
also
,
perhaps
,
encounter
some
Gresham
enmity
:
this
be
a
point
on
which
he
do
think
more
than
once
:
but
what
will
not
a
man
encounter
for
the
sake
of
two
hundred
thousand
pound
?
  
<EOS>
It
be
thus
that
Mr
Moffat
argue
with
himself
,
with
much
prudence
,
and
bring
himself
to
resolve
that
he
would
at
any
rate
become
a
candidate
for
the
great
prize
.
<EOS>
He
also
,
therefore
,
begin
to
say
soft
thing
;
and
it
must
be
admit
that
he
say
them
with
more
considerate
propriety
than
have
the
honourable
George
.
<EOS>
Mr
Moffat
have
an
idea
that
Miss
Dunstable
be
not
a
fool
,
and
that
in
order
to
catch
her
he
must
do
more
than
endeavour
to
lay
salt
on
her
tail
,
in
the
guise
of
flattery
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
to
him
that
she
be
a
bird
of
some
cunning
,
not
to
be
catch
by
an
ordinary
gin
,
such
as
those
commonly
in
use
with
the
honourable
Georges
of
Society
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
to
Mr
Moffat
,
that
though
Miss
Dunstable
be
so
sprightly
,
so
full
of
fun
,
and
so
ready
to
chatter
on
all
subject
,
she
well
know
the
value
of
her
own
money
,
and
of
her
position
as
dependent
on
it
:
he
perceive
that
she
never
flatter
the
countess
,
and
seem
to
be
no
whit
absorb
by
the
title
grandeur
of
her
host
's
family
.
<EOS>
He
give
her
credit
,
therefore
,
for
an
independent
spirit
:
and
an
independent
spirit
in
his
estimation
be
one
that
place
its
sole
dependence
on
a
respectable
balance
at
its
banker
's
.
  
<EOS>
work
on
these
idea
,
Mr
Moffat
commence
operation
in
such
manner
<EOS>
that
his
overture
to
the
heiress
should
not
,
if
unsuccessful
,
interfere
with
the
Greshamsbury
engagement
.
<EOS>
He
begin
by
make
common
cause
with
Miss
Dunstable
:
their
position
in
the
world
,
he
say
to
her
,
be
closely
similar
.
<EOS>
They
have
both
rise
from
the
low
class
by
the
strength
of
honest
industry
:
they
be
both
now
wealthy
,
and
have
both
hitherto
make
such
use
of
their
wealth
as
to
induce
the
high
aristocracy
of
England
to
admit
them
into
their
circle
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Mr
Moffat
,
"
have
Miss
Dunstable
remark
;
"
and
if
all
that
I
hear
be
true
,
to
admit
you
into
their
very
family
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
this
Mr
Moffat
slightly
demur
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
affect
,
he
say
,
to
misunderstand
what
Miss
Dunstable
mean
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
something
say
on
the
probability
of
such
an
event
;
but
he
beg
Miss
Dunstable
not
to
believe
all
that
she
hear
on
such
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
much
,
"
say
she
;
"
but
I
certainly
do
think
that
that
may
be
credit
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Moffat
then
go
on
to
show
how
it
behove
them
both
,
in
hold
out
their
hand
half
-
way
to
meet
the
aristocratic
overture
that
be
make
to
them
,
not
to
allow
themselves
to
be
make
use
of
.
<EOS>
the
aristocracy
,
accord
to
Mr
Moffat
,
be
people
of
a
very
nice
sort
;
the
good
acquaintance
in
the
world
;
a
portion
of
mankind
to
be
notice
by
whom
should
be
one
of
the
first
object
in
the
life
of
the
Dunstables
and
the
moffat
.
<EOS>
but
the
Dunstables
and
Moffats
should
be
very
careful
to
give
little
or
nothing
in
return
.
<EOS>
much
,
very
much
in
return
,
would
be
look
for
.
<EOS>
the
aristocracy
,
say
Mr
Moffat
,
be
not
a
people
to
allow
the
light
of
their
countenance
to
shine
forth
without
look
for
a
_
quid
pro
quo
_
,
for
some
compensating
value
.
<EOS>
in
all
their
intercourse
with
the
Dunstables
and
Moffats
,
they
would
expect
a
payment
.
<EOS>
It
be
for
the
Dunstables
and
Moffats
to
see
that
,
at
any
rate
,
they
do
not
pay
more
for
the
article
they
get
than
its
market
value
.
  
<EOS>
the
way
in
which
she
,
Miss
Dunstable
,
and
he
,
Mr
Moffat
,
would
be
require
to
pay
would
be
by
take
each
of
them
some
poor
scion
of
the
aristocracy
in
marriage
;
and
thus
expend
their
hard
-
earn
wealth
in
procure
high
-
price
pleasure
for
some
well
-
bear
pauper
.
<EOS>
against
this
,
peculiar
caution
be
to
be
use
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
the
further
induction
to
be
show
be
this
:
that
people
so
circumstance
should
marry
among
themselves
;
the
dunstable
and
the
moffat
each
with
the
other
,
and
not
tumble
into
the
pitfall
prepare
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
whether
these
great
lesson
have
any
lasting
effect
on
Miss
Dunstable
's
mind
may
be
doubt
.
<EOS>
perhaps
she
have
already
make
up
her
mind
on
the
subject
which
Mr
Moffat
so
well
discuss
.
<EOS>
She
be
old
than
Mr
Moffat
,
and
,
in
spite
of
his
two
year
of
parliamentary
experience
,
have
perhaps
more
knowledge
of
the
world
with
which
she
have
to
deal
.
<EOS>
but
she
listen
to
what
he
say
with
complacency
;
understand
his
object
as
well
as
she
have
that
of
his
aristocratic
rival
;
be
no
whit
offend
;
but
groan
in
her
spirit
as
she
think
of
the
wrong
of
Augusta
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
but
all
this
good
advice
,
however
,
would
not
win
the
money
for
Mr
Moffat
without
some
more
decide
step
;
and
that
step
he
soon
decide
on
take
,
feel
assure
that
what
he
have
say
would
have
its
due
weight
with
the
heiress
.
  
<EOS>
the
party
at
Courcy
Castle
be
now
soon
about
to
be
break
up
.
<EOS>
the
male
de
Courcys
be
go
down
to
a
Scotch
mountain
.
<EOS>
the
female
de
Courcys
be
to
be
ship
off
to
an
irish
castle
.
<EOS>
Mr
Moffat
be
to
go
up
to
town
to
prepare
his
petition
.
<EOS>
Miss
Dunstable
be
again
about
to
start
on
a
foreign
tour
in
behalf
of
her
physician
and
attendant
;
and
Frank
Gresham
be
at
last
to
be
allow
to
go
to
Cambridge
;
that
be
to
say
,
unless
his
success
with
Miss
Dunstable
should
render
such
a
step
on
his
part
quite
preposterous
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
may
speak
now
,
Frank
,
"
say
the
countess
.
<EOS>
"
I
really
think
you
may
:
you
have
know
her
now
for
a
considerable
time
;
and
,
as
far
as
I
can
judge
,
she
be
very
fond
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
nonsense
,
aunt
,
"
say
Frank
;
"
she
do
not
care
a
button
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
differently
;
and
looker
-
on
<EOS>
,
you
know
,
always
understand
the
game
good
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
be
not
afraid
to
ask
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
afraid
!
"
<EOS>
say
Frank
,
in
a
tone
of
considerable
scorn
.
<EOS>
He
almost
make
up
his
mind
that
he
would
ask
her
to
show
that
he
be
not
afraid
.
<EOS>
His
only
obstacle
to
do
so
be
,
that
he
have
not
the
slight
intention
of
marry
her
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
to
be
but
one
other
great
event
before
the
party
break
up
,
and
that
be
a
dinner
at
the
Duke
of
Omnium
's
.
<EOS>
the
duke
have
already
decline
to
come
to
Courcy
;
but
he
have
in
a
measure
atone
for
this
by
ask
some
of
the
guest
to
join
a
great
dinner
which
he
be
about
to
give
to
his
neighbour
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Moffat
be
to
leave
Courcy
Castle
the
day
after
the
dinner
-
party
,
and
he
therefore
determine
to
make
his
great
attempt
on
the
morning
of
that
day
.
<EOS>
It
be
with
some
difficulty
that
he
bring
about
an
opportunity
;
but
at
last
he
do
so
,
and
find
himself
alone
with
Miss
Dunstable
in
the
walk
of
Courcy
Park
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
strange
thing
,
be
it
not
,
"
say
he
,
recur
to
his
old
view
of
the
same
subject
,
"
that
I
should
be
go
to
dine
with
the
Duke
of
Omnium
 
the
rich
man
,
they
say
,
among
the
whole
english
aristocracy
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
men
of
that
kind
entertain
everybody
,
I
believe
,
now
and
then
,
"
say
Miss
Dunstable
,
not
very
civilly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
they
do
;
but
I
be
not
go
as
one
of
the
everybodie
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
from
Lord
de
Courcy
's
house
with
some
of
his
own
family
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
pride
in
that
 
not
the
least
;
I
have
more
pride
in
my
father
's
honest
industry
.
<EOS>
but
it
show
what
money
do
in
this
country
of
ours
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
indeed
;
money
do
a
great
deal
many
queer
thing
.
"
<EOS>
in
say
this
Miss
Dunstable
could
not
but
think
that
money
have
do
a
very
queer
thing
in
induce
Miss
Gresham
to
fall
in
love
with
Mr
Moffat
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
wealth
be
very
powerful
:
here
we
be
,
Miss
Dunstable
,
the
most
honoured
guest
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
I
do
not
know
about
that
;
you
may
be
,
for
you
be
a
member
of
Parliament
,
and
all
that
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
;
not
a
member
now
,
Miss
Dunstable
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
will
be
,
and
that
be
all
the
same
;
but
I
have
no
such
title
to
honour
,
thank
God
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
walk
on
in
silence
for
a
little
while
,
for
Mr
Moffat
hardly
know
how
to
manage
the
business
he
have
in
hand
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
quite
delightful
to
watch
these
people
,
"
he
say
at
last
;
"
now
they
accuse
us
of
be
tuft
-
hunter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
they
?
"
say
Miss
Dunstable
.
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
I
do
not
know
that
anybody
ever
so
accuse
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
you
and
me
personally
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
be
glad
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
that
be
what
the
world
say
of
person
of
our
class
.
<EOS>
now
it
seem
to
me
that
the
toadying
be
all
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
the
countess
here
do
toady
you
,
and
so
do
the
young
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
they
?
<EOS>
if
so
,
upon
my
word
I
do
not
know
it
.
<EOS>
but
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
do
not
think
much
of
such
thing
.
<EOS>
I
live
mostly
to
myself
,
Mr
Moffat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
that
you
do
,
and
I
admire
you
for
it
;
but
,
Miss
Dunstable
,
you
can
not
always
live
so
,
"
and
Mr
Moffat
look
at
her
in
a
manner
which
give
her
the
first
intimation
of
his
come
burst
of
tenderness
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
as
may
be
,
Mr
Moffat
,
"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
He
go
on
beat
about
the
bush
for
some
time
 
give
her
to
understand
how
necessary
it
be
that
person
situate
as
they
be
should
live
either
for
themselves
or
for
each
other
,
and
that
,
above
all
thing
,
they
should
beware
of
fall
into
the
mouth
of
voracious
aristocratic
lion
who
go
about
look
for
prey
 
till
they
come
to
a
turn
in
the
ground
;
at
which
Miss
Dunstable
declare
her
determination
of
go
in
.
<EOS>
She
have
walk
enough
,
she
say
.
<EOS>
as
by
this
time
Mr
Moffat
's
immediate
intention
be
become
visible
she
think
it
prudent
to
retire
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
let
me
take
you
in
,
Mr
Moffat
;
but
my
boot
be
a
little
damp
,
and
Dr
Easyman
will
never
forgive
me
if
I
do
not
hurry
in
as
fast
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
foot
damp

<EOS>
I
hope
not
:
I
do
hope
not

"
say
he
,
with
a
look
of
the
great
solicitude
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
it
be
nothing
to
signify
;
but
it
be
well
to
be
prudent

you
know

<EOS>
good
morning

Mr

"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss

!

"
  
<EOS>

eh
 
yes

Miss
Dunstable
stop
in
the
grand
path

I
will
not

you
return
with
me

I

be
leave
this

yes

I
go
myself
the
day
after
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
town

you

go
abroad

<EOS>
It
may
be
long
 
very
long
 
before
we
meet
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
about
Easter
,
"
say
Miss
Dunstable
;
"
that
be
,
if
the
doctor
do
not
knock
up
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
have
,
have
wish
to
say
something
before
we
part
for
so
long
a
time
.
<EOS>
Miss
Dunstable
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
stop
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Moffat
.
<EOS>
let
me
ask
you
one
question
.
<EOS>
I
will
hear
anything
that
you
have
get
to
say
,
but
on
one
condition
:
that
is
,
that
Miss
Augusta
Gresham
shall
be
by
while
you
say
it
.
<EOS>
Will
you
consent
to
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Augusta
Gresham
,
"
say
he
,
"
have
no
right
to
listen
to
my
private
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
she
not
,
Mr
Moffat
?
<EOS>
then
I
think
she
should
have
.
<EOS>
I
,
at
any
rate
,
will
not
so
far
interfere
with
what
I
look
on
as
her
undoubted
privilege
as
to
be
a
party
to
any
secret
in
which
she
may
not
participate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Miss
Dunstable
 
"
  
"
and
to
tell
you
fairly
,
Mr
Moffat
,
any
secret
that
you
do
tell
me
,
I
shall
most
undoubtedly
repeat
to
her
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
good
morning
,
Mr
Moffat
;
my
foot
be
certainly
a
little
damp
,
and
if
I
stay
a
moment
longer
,
Dr
Easyman
will
put
off
my
foreign
trip
for
at
least
a
week
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
she
leave
him
stand
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
gravel
-
walk
.
  
<EOS>
for
a
moment
or
two
,
Mr
Moffat
console
himself
in
his
misfortune
by
think
how
he
may
best
avenge
himself
on
Miss
Dunstable
.
<EOS>
soon
,
however
,
such
futile
idea
leave
his
brain
.
<EOS>
why
should
he
give
over
the
chase
because
the
rich
galleon
have
escape
him
on
this
,
his
first
cruise
in
pursuit
of
her
?
<EOS>
such
prize
be
not
to
be
win
so
easily
.
<EOS>
Her
present
objection
clearly
consist
in
his
engagement
to
Miss
Gresham
,
and
in
that
only
.
<EOS>
let
that
engagement
be
at
an
end
,
notoriously
and
publicly
break
off
,
and
this
objection
would
fall
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
yes
;
ship
so
richly
freight
be
not
to
be
run
down
in
one
summer
morning
's
plain
sailing
.
<EOS>
instead
of
look
for
his
revenge
on
Miss
Dunstable
,
it
would
be
more
prudent
in
him
 
more
in
keeping
with
his
character
 
to
pursue
his
object
,
and
overcome
such
difficulty
as
he
may
find
in
his
way
.
   
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
omnium
 
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Omnium
be
,
as
we
have
say
,
a
bachelor
.
<EOS>
not
the
less
on
that
account
do
he
on
certain
rare
gala
day
<EOS>
entertain
the
beauty
of
the
county
at
his
magnificent
rural
seat
,
or
the
female
fashion
of
London
in
Belgrave
Square
;
but
on
this
occasion
the
dinner
at
Gatherum
Castle
 
for
such
be
the
name
of
his
mansion
 
<EOS>
be
to
be
confine
to
the
lord
of
the
creation
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
one
of
those
day
on
which
he
collect
round
his
board
all
the
notable
of
the
county
,
in
order
that
his
popularity
may
not
wane
,
or
the
establish
glory
of
his
hospitable
house
become
dim
.
  
<EOS>
on
such
an
occasion
it
be
not
probable
that
Lord
de
Courcy
would
be
one
of
the
guest
.
<EOS>
the
party
,
indeed
,
who
go
from
Courcy
Castle
be
not
large
,
and
consist
of
the
honourable
George
,
Mr
Moffat
,
and
Frank
Gresham
.
<EOS>
They
go
in
a
tax
-
cart
,
with
a
tandem
horse
,
drive
very
knowingly
by
George
de
Courcy
;
and
the
fourth
seat
on
the
back
of
the
vehicle
be
occupy
by
a
servant
,
who
be
to
look
after
the
horse
at
Gatherum
.
  
<EOS>
the
honourable
George
drive
either
well
or
luckily
,
for
he
reach
the
duke
's
house
in
safety
;
but
he
drive
very
fast
.
<EOS>
Poor
Miss
Dunstable
!
<EOS>
what
would
have
be
her
lot
have
anything
but
good
happen
to
that
vehicle
,
so
richly
freight
with
her
three
lover
!
<EOS>
They
do
not
quarrel
as
to
the
prize
,
and
all
reach
Gatherum
Castle
in
good
humour
with
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
the
castle
be
new
building
of
white
stone
,
lately
erect
at
an
enormous
cost
by
one
of
the
first
architect
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
immense
pile
,
and
seem
to
cover
ground
enough
for
a
moderate
-
sized
town
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
report
say
that
when
it
be
complete
,
the
noble
owner
find
that
he
have
no
room
to
live
in
;
and
that
,
on
this
account
,
when
dispose
to
study
his
own
comfort
,
he
reside
in
a
house
of
perhaps
one
-
tenth
the
size
,
build
by
his
grandfather
in
another
county
.
  
<EOS>
Gatherum
Castle
would
probably
be
call
italian
in
its
style
of
architecture
;
though
it
may
,
I
think
,
be
doubt
whether
any
such
edifice
,
or
anything
like
it
,
be
ever
see
in
any
part
of
Italy
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
vast
edifice
;
irregular
in
height
 
or
it
appear
to
be
<EOS>
so
 
have
long
wing
on
each
side
too
high
to
be
pass
over
by
the
eye
as
mere
adjunct
to
the
mansion
,
and
a
portico
so
large
as
to
make
the
house
behind
it
look
like
another
building
of
a
great
altitude
.
<EOS>
this
portico
be
support
by
ionic
column
,
and
be
in
itself
doubtless
a
beautiful
structure
.
<EOS>
It
be
approach
by
a
flight
of
step
,
very
broad
and
very
grand
;
but
,
as
an
approach
by
a
flight
of
step
hardly
suit
an
Englishman
's
house
,
to
the
immediate
entrance
of
which
it
be
necessary
that
his
carriage
should
drive
,
there
be
another
front
door
in
one
of
the
wing
which
be
commonly
use
.
<EOS>
a
carriage
,
however
,
could
on
very
stupendously
grand
occasion
 
<EOS>
the
visit
,
for
instance
,
of
queen
and
king
,
and
royal
duke
 
be
bring
up
under
the
portico
;
as
the
step
have
be
so
construct
as
to
admit
of
a
road
,
with
a
rather
stiff
ascent
,
be
make
close
in
front
of
the
wing
up
into
the
very
porch
.
  
<EOS>
opening
from
the
porch
be
the
grand
hall
,
which
extend
up
to
the
top
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
be
magnificent
,
indeed
;
be
decorate
with
many
-
coloured
marble
,
and
hang
round
with
various
trophy
of
the
house
of
Omnium
;
banner
be
there
,
and
armour
;
the
sculptured
bust
of
many
noble
progenitor
;
full
-
length
figure
in
marble
of
those
who
have
be
especially
prominent
;
and
every
monument
of
glory
that
wealth
,
long
year
,
and
great
achievement
could
bring
together
.
<EOS>
if
only
a
man
could
but
live
in
his
hall
and
be
for
ever
happy
there
!
<EOS>
but
the
Duke
of
Omnium
could
not
live
happily
in
his
hall
;
and
the
fact
be
,
that
the
architect
,
in
contrive
this
magnificent
entrance
for
his
own
honour
and
fame
,
have
destroy
the
duke
's
house
as
regard
most
of
the
ordinary
purpose
of
residence
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
Gatherum
Castle
be
a
very
noble
pile
;
and
,
stand
as
it
do
on
an
eminence
,
have
a
very
fine
effect
when
see
from
many
a
distant
knoll
and
verdant
-
wooded
hill
.
  
<EOS>
at
seven
o'clock
Mr
de
Courcy
and
his
friend
get
down
from
their
drag
at
the
small
door
 
for
this
be
no
day
on
which
to
mount
up
under
the
portico
;
nor
be
that
any
suitable
vehicle
to
have
be
entitle
to
such
honour
.
<EOS>
Frank
feel
some
excitement
a
little
strong
than
that
usual
to
him
at
such
moment
,
for
he
have
never
yet
be
in
company
with
the
Duke
of
Omnium
;
and
he
rather
puzzle
himself
to
think
on
what
point
he
would
talk
to
the
man
who
be
the
large
landowner
in
that
county
in
which
he
himself
have
so
great
an
interest
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
make
up
his
mind
that
he
would
allow
the
duke
to
choose
his
own
subject
;
merely
reserve
to
himself
the
right
of
point
out
how
deficient
in
gorse
cover
be
West
Barsetshire
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
duke
's
division
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
soon
divest
of
their
coat
and
hat
,
and
,
without
enter
on
the
magnificence
of
the
great
hall
,
be
conduct
through
rather
a
narrow
passage
into
rather
a
small
drawing
-
room
 
small
,
that
is
,
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
gentleman
there
assemble
.
<EOS>
there
may
be
about
thirty
,
and
Frank
be
incline
to
think
that
they
be
almost
crowded
.
<EOS>
a
man
come
forward
to
greet
them
when
their
name
be
announce
;
but
our
hero
at
once
know
that
he
be
not
the
duke
;
for
this
man
be
fat
and
short
,
whereas
the
duke
be
thin
and
tall
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
hubbub
go
on
;
for
everybody
seem
to
be
talk
to
his
neighbour
;
or
,
in
default
of
a
neighbour
,
to
himself
.
<EOS>
It
be
clear
that
the
exalted
rank
of
their
host
have
put
very
little
constraint
on
his
guest
"
tongue
,
for
they
chat
away
with
as
much
freedom
as
farmer
at
an
ordinary
.
  
<EOS>
"
which
be
the
duke
?
"
<EOS>
at
last
Frank
contrive
to
whisper
to
his
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
;
 
he
be
not
here
,
"
say
George
;
"
I
suppose
he
will
be
in
presently
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
never
show
till
just
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
,
of
course
,
have
nothing
further
to
say
;
but
he
already
begin
to
feel
himself
a
little
snubbed
:
he
think
that
the
duke
,
duke
though
he
be
,
when
he
ask
people
to
dinner
should
be
there
to
tell
them
that
he
be
glad
to
see
them
.
  
<EOS>
More
people
flash
into
the
room
,
and
Frank
find
himself
rather
closely
wedge
in
with
a
stout
clergyman
of
his
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
badly
off
,
for
Mr
Athill
be
a
friend
of
his
own
,
who
have
hold
a
living
near
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
lately
,
however
,
at
the
lamented
decease
of
Dr
Stanhope
 
who
have
die
of
apoplexy
at
his
villa
in
Italy
 
<EOS>
Mr
Athill
have
be
present
with
the
well
preferment
of
Eiderdown
,
and
have
,
therefore
,
remove
to
another
part
of
the
county
.
<EOS>
He
be
somewhat
of
a
bon
-
vivant
,
and
a
man
who
thoroughly
understand
dinner
-
party
;
and
with
much
good
nature
he
take
Frank
under
his
special
protection
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
stick
to
me
,
Mr
Gresham
,
"
he
say
,
"
when
we
go
into
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
I
be
an
old
hand
at
the
duke
's
dinner
,
and
know
how
to
make
a
friend
comfortable
as
well
as
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
why
do
not
the
duke
come
in
?
"
demand
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
be
here
as
soon
as
dinner
be
ready
,
"
say
Mr
Athill
.
<EOS>
"
or
,
rather
,
the
dinner
will
be
ready
as
soon
as
he
be
here
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
,
therefore
,
how
soon
he
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
do
not
understand
this
,
but
he
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
wait
and
see
how
thing
go
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
begin
to
be
impatient
,
for
the
room
be
now
nearly
full
,
and
it
seem
evident
that
no
other
guest
be
come
;
when
suddenly
a
bell
rang
,
and
a
gong
be
sound
,
and
at
the
same
instant
a
door
that
have
not
yet
be
use
fly
open
,
and
a
very
plainly
dressed
,
plain
,
tall
man
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
Frank
at
once
know
that
he
be
at
last
in
the
presence
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
  
<EOS>
but
his
grace
,
late
as
he
be
in
commence
the
duty
as
host
,
seem
in
no
hurry
to
make
up
for
lose
time
.
<EOS>
He
quietly
stand
on
the
rug
,
with
his
back
to
the
empty
grate
,
and
speak
one
or
two
word
in
a
very
low
voice
to
one
or
two
gentleman
who
stand
near
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
crowd
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
become
suddenly
silent
.
<EOS>
Frank
,
when
he
find
that
the
duke
do
not
come
and
speak
to
him
,
feel
that
he
ought
to
go
and
speak
to
the
duke
;
but
no
one
else
do
so
,
and
when
he
whisper
his
surprise
to
Mr
Athill
,
that
gentleman
tell
him
that
this
be
the
duke
's
practice
on
all
such
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
fothergill
,
"
say
the
duke
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
the
only
word
he
have
yet
speak
out
loud
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
we
be
ready
for
dinner
.
"
<EOS>
now
Mr
Fothergill
be
the
duke
's
land
-
agent
,
and
he
<EOS>
it
be
who
have
greet
Frank
and
his
friend
at
their
entrance
.
  
<EOS>
immediately
the
gong
be
again
sound
,
and
another
door
lead
out
of
the
drawing
-
room
into
the
dining
-
room
be
open
.
<EOS>
the
duke
lead
the
way
,
and
then
the
guest
follow
.
<EOS>
"
stick
close
to
me
,
Mr
Gresham
,
"
say
Athill
,
"
we
will
get
about
the
middle
of
the
table
,
where
we
shall
be
cosy
 
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
,
out
of
this
dreadful
draught
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
place
<EOS>
well
,
Mr
Gresham
;
stick
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Athill
,
who
be
a
pleasant
,
chatty
companion
,
have
hardly
seat
himself
,
and
be
talk
to
Frank
as
quickly
as
he
could
,
when
Mr
Fothergill
,
who
sit
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
,
ask
him
to
say
grace
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
be
quite
out
of
the
question
that
the
duke
should
take
any
trouble
with
his
guest
whatever
.
<EOS>
Mr
Athill
consequently
drop
the
word
he
be
speak
,
and
utter
a
prayer
 
if
it
be
a
prayer
 
that
they
may
all
have
grateful
heart
for
that
<EOS>
which
God
be
about
to
give
them
.
  
<EOS>
if
it
be
a
prayer
!
<EOS>
as
far
as
my
own
experience
go
,
such
utterance
be
seldom
prayer
,
seldom
can
be
prayer
.
<EOS>
and
if
not
prayer
,
what
then
?
<EOS>
to
me
it
be
unintelligible
that
the
full
tide
of
glibbest
chatter
can
be
stop
at
a
moment
in
the
midst
of
profuse
good
living
,
and
the
Giver
thank
becomingly
in
word
of
heartfelt
praise
.
<EOS>
set
aside
for
the
moment
what
one
daily
hear
and
see
,
may
not
one
declare
that
a
change
so
sudden
be
not
within
the
compass
of
the
human
mind
?
<EOS>
but
then
,
to
such
reasoning
one
can
not
but
add
what
one
do
hear
and
see
;
one
can
not
but
judge
of
the
ceremony
by
the
manner
in
which
one
see
it
perform
 
utter
,
that
is
 
and
listen
to
.
<EOS>
clergyman
<EOS>
there
be
 
one
meet
them
now
<EOS>
and
then
 
who
endeavour
to
give
to
the
dinner
-
table
grace
some
of
the
solemnity
of
a
church
ritual
,
and
what
be
the
effect
?
<EOS>
much
the
same
as
though
one
be
to
be
interrupt
for
a
minute
in
the
midst
of
one
of
our
church
liturgy
to
hear
a
drinking
-
song
.
  
<EOS>
and
it
will
be
argue
,
that
a
man
nee
be
less
thankful
because
,
at
the
moment
of
receive
,
he
utter
no
thanksgiving
?
<EOS>
or
will
it
be
think
that
a
man
be
make
thankful
because
what
be
call
a
grace
be
utter
after
dinner
?
<EOS>
It
can
hardly
be
imagine
that
any
one
will
so
argue
,
or
so
think
.
  
<EOS>
dinner
-
grace
be
,
probably
,
the
last
remain
relic
of
certain
daily
service
[

]
which
the
Church
in
olden
day
enjoin
:
nones
,
compline
,
and
vesper
be
other
.
<EOS>
of
the
none
and
compline
we
have
happily
get
quit
;
and
it
may
be
well
if
we
could
get
rid
of
the
dinner
-
grace
also
.
<EOS>
let
any
man
ask
himself
whether
,
on
his
own
part
,
they
be
act
of
prayer
and
thanksgiving
 
and
if
not
that
,
what
then
?
  
<EOS>
when
the
large
party
enter
the
dining
-
room
one
or
two
gentleman
may
be
see
to
come
in
from
some
other
door
and
set
themselves
at
the
table
near
to
the
duke
's
chair
.
<EOS>
these
be
guest
of
his
own
,
who
be
stay
in
the
house
,
his
particular
friend
,
the
man
with
whom
he
live
:
the
other
be
stranger
whom
he
feed
,
perhaps
once
a
year
,
in
order
that
his
name
may
be
know
in
the
land
as
that
of
one
who
distribute
food
and
wine
hospitably
through
the
county
.
<EOS>
the
food
and
wine
,
the
attendance
also
,
and
the
view
of
the
vast
repository
of
plate
he
vouchsafe
willingly
to
his
county
neighbour
;
 
but
<EOS>
it
be
beyond
his
good
nature
to
talk
to
them
.
<EOS>
to
judge
by
the
present
appearance
of
most
of
them
,
they
be
quite
as
well
satisfied
to
be
leave
alone
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
be
altogether
a
stranger
there
,
but
Mr
Athill
know
every
one
at
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
Apjohn
,
"
say
he
:
"
<EOS>
do
not
you
know
,
Mr
Apjohn
,
the
attorney
from
Barchester

<EOS>
he
be
always
here
;
he
do
some
of
Fothergill
's
law
business
,
and
make
himself
useful
.
<EOS>
if
any
fellow
know
the
value
of
a
good
dinner
,
he
do
.
<EOS>
You
will
see
that
the
duke
's
hospitality
will
not
be
throw
away
on
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
much
throw
away
upon
me
,
I
know

say
Frank
,
who
could
not
at
all
put
up
with
the
idea
of
sit
down
to
dinner
without
have
be
speak
to
by
his
host

<EOS>
"
oh
,
nonsense
!
<EOS>
"
say
his
clerical
friend

"
you
will
enjoy
yourself
amazingly
by

there
be
not
such
champagne
in
any
other
house

Barsetshire
;
and
then
the
claret
 
"
<EOS>
and
Mr
Athill
press
his
lip
together
,
and
gently
shake
his
head
,
mean
to
signify
by
the
motion
that
the
claret
of
Gatherum
Castle
be
sufficient
atonement
for
any
penance
which
a
man
may
have
to
go
through
in
his
mode
of
obtain
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
that
funny
little
man
sit
there

next

one
to

never

such
a
queer
fellow

"
do
not
you
know
old
Bolus
?
<EOS>
well
,
I
think
every
one
in
Barsetshire
know
Bolus
;
you
especially
should
do
so
,
as
he
be
such
a
dear
friend
of
Dr
Thorne

yes

he
be
apothecary
at
Scarington
in
the
old
day
,
before
Dr
Fillgrave
come
into
vogue

I
remember
when
Bolus
be
think
to

a
very
good

"
  
"
<EOS>
ha

ha

<EOS>
well
,
I
suppose
we
must
be
charitable

and
say
that

be
quite
as
good

and
Mr

as
he

whisper
into
Frank

ear
,
"
You
see
there
be
Finnie
here

another
Barchester

I
really

the
more
the
merrier

well

something
a

I
wonder
why

be
sure
he
be
ask

<EOS>

perhaps
he
do
not

wish
to
meet
Finnie

Bolus

<EOS>
do
you
know

Mr

I
think
he
be
quite

be
more

you
be
young

you
happy

Thorne
should
have
more
sense

he
ought
to
show
himself
here

<EOS>
the
gormandizing
be
now
go
on
at
a
tremendous
rate

<EOS>
though
the
volubility
of
their
tongue
have
be
for
a
while
stop
by
the
first
shock
of
the
duke
's
presence
,
the
guest
seem
to
feel
no
such
constraint
upon
their
tooth

<EOS>
They
feed
,
one
may
almost
say
,
rabidly
,
and
give
their
order
to
the
servant
in
an
eager
manner
;
much
more
impressive
than
that
usual
at
small
party

<EOS>
Mr
Apjohn
,
who
sit

have
,
by
some
well

plan
manoeuvre

contrive
to

him
the
jowl
of

unfortunately

he

successful

least
think
Mr
Apjohn
 
have
be
put
on
his
plate
;
and
a
servant
,
with
a
huge
sauce
tureen
,
absolutely
pass
behind
his
back
inattentive
to
his
audible
request
.
<EOS>
poor
Mr
Apjohn
in
his
despair
turn
round
to
arrest
the
man
by
his
coat
-
tail
;
but
he
be
a
moment
too
late
,
and
all
but
fall
backwards
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
as
he
right
himself
he
mutter
an
anathema
,
and
look
with
a
face
of
anguish
at
his
plate
.
  
<EOS>
"
anything
the
matter
,
Apjohn
?
"
say
Mr
Fothergill
,
kindly
,
see
the
utter
despair
write
on
the
poor
man
's
countenance
;
"
can
I
get
anything
for
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
sauce
!
"
say
Mr
Apjohn
,
in
a
voice
that
would
have
melt
a
hermit
;
and
as
he
look
at
Mr
Fothergill
,
he
point
at
the
now
distant
sinner
,
who
be
dispense
his
melted
ambrosia
at
least
ten
head
upwards
,
away
from
the
unfortunate
supplicant
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Fothergill
,
however
,
know
where
to
look
for
balm
for
such
wound
,
and
in
a
minute
or
two
,
Mr
Apjohn
be
employ
quite
to
his
heart
's
content
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Frank
to
his
neighbour
,
"
it
may
be
very
well
once
in
a
way
;
but
I
think
that
on
the
whole
Dr
Thorne
be
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mr
Gresham
,
see
the
world
on
all
side
,
"
say
Mr
Athill
,
who
have
also
be
somewhat
intent
on
the
gratification
of
his
own
appetite
,
though
with
an
energy
less
evident
than
that
of
the
gentleman
opposite
.
<EOS>
"
see
the
world
on
all
side
if
you
have
an
opportunity
;
and
,
believe
me
,
a
good
dinner
now
and
then
be
a
very
good
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
but
I
do
not
like

it
with
hog
.

<EOS>
"
Whish
-
h
!
<EOS>
softly
,
softly
,
Mr
Gresham
,
or
you
will
disturb
Mr
Apjohn
's
digestion
.
<EOS>
upon
my
word
,
he
will
want
it
all
before
he
have
do
.
<EOS>
now
,
I
like
this
kind
of
thing
once
in
a
way
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
?
"
say
Frank
,
in
a
tone
that
be
almost
savage
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
indeed
I
do
.
<EOS>
one
see
so
much
character
.
<EOS>
and
after
all
,
what
harm
do
it
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
idea
be
that
people
should
live
with
those
whose
society
be
pleasant
to
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
live
 
<EOS>
yes
,
Mr
Gresham
 
<EOS>
I
agree
with
you
there
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
do
for
me
to
live
with
the
Duke
of
Omnium
;
I
should
not
understand
,
or
probably
approve
,
his
way
.
<EOS>
nor
should
I
,
perhaps
,
much
like
the
constant
presence
of
Mr
Apjohn
.
<EOS>
but
now
and
then
 
once
in
a
year
or
so
 
I
do
own
I
like
to
see
them
both
.
<EOS>
here
be
the
cup
;
now
,
whatever
you
do
,
Mr
Gresham
,
do
not
pass
the
cup
without
taste
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
the
dinner
pass
on
,
slowly
enough
as
Frank
think
,
but
all
too
quickly
for
Mr
Apjohn
.
<EOS>
It
pass
away
,
and
the
wine
come
circulate
freely
.
<EOS>
the
tongue
again
be
loose
,
the
tooth
be
release
from
their
labour
,
and
under
the
influence
of
the
claret
the
duke
's
presence
be
forget
.
  
<EOS>
but
very
speedily
the
coffee
be
bring
.
<EOS>
"
this
will
soon
be
over
now
,
"
say
Frank
,
to
himself
,
thankfully
;
for
,
though
he
be
no
mean
<EOS>
despise
good
claret
,
he
have
lose
his
temper
too
completely
to
enjoy
it
at
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
much
mistaken
;
the
farce
as
yet
be
only
at
its
commencement
.
<EOS>
the
duke
take
his
cup
of
coffee
,
and
so
do
the
few
friend
who
sit
close
to
him
;
but
the
beverage
do
not
seem
to
be
in
great
request
with
the
majority
of
the
guest
.
<EOS>
when
the
duke
have
take
his
modicum
,
he
rise
up
and
silently
retire
,
say
no
word
and
make
no
sign
.
<EOS>
and
then
the
farce
commence
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
gentleman
,
"
say
Mr
Fothergill
,
cheerily
,
"
we
be
all
right
.
<EOS>
Apjohn
,
be
there
claret
there
?
<EOS>
Mr
Bolus
,
I
know
you
stick
to
the
Madeira
;
you
be
quite
right
,
<EOS>
for
there
be
not
much
of
it
leave
,
and
my
belief
be
there
will
never
be
more
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
the
duke
's
hospitality
go
on
,
and
the
duke
's
guest
drink
merrily
for
the
next
two
hour
.
  
<EOS>
"
shall
not
we
see
any
more
of
him
?
"
ask
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
any
more
of
whom
?
"
say
Mr
Athill
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
the
duke
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
;
you
will
see
no
more
of
him

<EOS>
He
always
go
when
the
coffee
come
.
<EOS>
It
be
bring
in
as
an
excuse
.
<EOS>
We
have
have
enough
of
the
light
of
his
countenance
to
last
till
next
year
.
<EOS>
the
duke
and
I
be
excellent
friend
;
and
have
be
so
these
fifteen
year
;
but
I
never
see
more
of
him
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
go
away
,
"
say
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
.
<EOS>
Mr
de
Courcy
and
your
other
friend
will
not
stir
for
this
hour
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
.
<EOS>
I
shall
walk
on
,
and
they
may
catch
me
.
<EOS>
I
may
be
wrong
;
but
it
seem
to
me
that
a
man
insult
me
when
he
ask
me
to
dine
with
him
and
never
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
if
he
be
ten
time
Duke
of
Omnium
;
he
can
not
be
more
than
a
gentleman
,
and
as
such
I
be
his
equal
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
have
thus
give
vent
to
his
feeling
in
somewhat
high
-
fly
language
,
he
walk
forth
and
trudge
away
along
the
road
towards
Courcy
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
Gresham
have
be
bear
and
breed
a
Conservative
,
whereas
the
Duke
of
Omnium
be
well
know
as
a
consistent
Whig
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
one
so
devoutly
resolve
to
admit
of
no
superior
as
your
Conservative
,
bear
and
breed
,
no
one
so
inclined
to
high
domestic
despotism
as
your
thoroughgoe
consistent
old
Whig
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
proceed
about
six
mile
,
Frank
be
pick
up
by
his
friend
;
but
even
then
his
anger
have
hardly
cool
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
the
duke
as
civil
as
ever
when
you
take
your
leave
of
him
?
"
say
he
to
his
cousin
George
,
as
he
take
his
seat
on
the
drag
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
juke

"
hiccup
out
the
honourable
George
,
as
he
touch
up
the
leader
under
the
flank
.
   
<EOS>
the
proposal
 
<EOS>
and
now
the
departure
from
Courcy
Castle
come
rapidly
one
after
another
,
and
there
remain
but
one
more
evening
before
Miss
Dunstable
's
carriage
be
to
be
pack
.
<EOS>
the
countess
,
in
the
early
moment
of
Frank
's
courtship
,
have
control
his
ardour
and
check
the
rapidity
of
his
amorous
profession
;
but
as
day
,
and
at
last
week
,
wear
away
,
she
find
that
it
be
necessary
to
stir
the
fire
which
she
have
before
endeavour
to
slacken
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
will
be
nobody
here
to
-
night
but
our
own
circle
,
"
say
she
to
him
,
"
and
I
really
think
you
should
tell
Miss
Dunstable
what
your
intention
be
.
<EOS>
She
will
have
fair
ground
to
complain
of
you
if
you
do
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
begin
to
feel
that
he
be
in
a
dilemma
.
<EOS>
He
have
commence
make
love
to
Miss
Dunstable
partly
because
he
like
the
amusement
,
and
partly
from
a
satirical
propensity
to
quiz
his
aunt
by
appear
to
fall
into
her
scheme
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
overshot
the
mark
,
and
do
not
know
what
answer
to
give
when
he
be
thus
call
upon
to
make
a
downright
proposal
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
although
he
do
not
care
two
rush
about
Miss
Dunstable
in
the
way
of
love
,
he
nevertheless
experience
a
sort
of
jealousy
when
he
find
that
she
appear
to
be
indifferent
to
him
,
and
that
she
correspond
the
meanwhile
with
his
cousin
George
.
<EOS>
though
all
their
flirtation
have
be
carry
on
on
both
side
palpably
by
way
of
fun
,
though
Frank
have
tell
himself
ten
time
a
day
that
his
heart
be
true
to
Mary
Thorne
,
yet
he
have
an
undefined
feeling
that
it
behove
Miss
Dunstable
to
be
a
little
in
love
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
quite
at
ease
in
that
she
be
not
a
little
melancholy
now
that
his
departure
be
so
nigh
;
and
,
above
all
,
he
be
anxious
to
know
what
be
the
real
fact
about
that
letter
.
<EOS>
He
have
in
his
own
breast
threaten
Miss
Dunstable
with
a
heartache
;
and
now
,
when
the
time
for
their
separation
come
,
he
find
that
his
own
heart
be
the
more
likely
to
ache
of
the
two
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
must
say
something
to
her
,
or
my
aunt
will
never
be
satisfied
,
"
say
he
to
himself
as
he
saunter
into
the
little
drawing
-
room
on
that
last
evening
.
<EOS>
but
at
the
very
time
he
be
ashamed
of
himself
,
for
he
know
he
be
go
to
ask
badly
.
  
<EOS>
His
sister
and
one
of
his
cousin
be
in
the
room
,
but
his
aunt
,
who
be
quite
on
the
alert
,
soon
get
them
out
of
it
,
and
Frank
and
Miss
Dunstable
be
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
all
our
fun
and
all
our
laughter
be
come
to
an
end
,
"
say
she
,
begin
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
how
you
feel
,
but
for
myself
I
really
be
a
little
melancholy
at
the
idea
of
part
;
"
and
she
look
up
at
him
with
her
laugh
black
eye
,
as
though
she
never
have
,
and
never
could
have
a
care
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
"
Melancholy
!
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
;
you
look
so
,
"
say
Frank
,
who
really
do
feel
somewhat
lackadaisically
sentimental
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
how
thoroughly
glad
the
countess
must
be
that
we
be
both
go
,
"
continue
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
declare
we
have
treat
her
most
infamously
.
<EOS>
ever
since
we
have
be
here
<EOS>
we
have
have
all
the
amusement
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
I
have
sometimes
think
she
would
turn
me
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
with
all
my
heart
she
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
you
cruel
barbarian
!
<EOS>
why
on
earth
should
you
wish
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
I
may
have
join
you
in
your
exile

<EOS>
I
hate
Courcy
Castle
,
and
should
have
rejoice
to
leave
 
and
 
and
 
"
  
"
and
what
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
love
Miss
Dunstable
,
and
should
have
doubly
,
trebly
rejoice
to
leave
it
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
's
voice
quiver
a
little
as
he
make
this
gallant
profession
;
but
still
Miss
Dunstable
only
laugh
the
loud
.
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
of
all
my
knight
you
be
by
far
the
best
behave
,

say
she
,
"
and
say
much
the
pretty
thing

"
<EOS>
Frank
become
rather
red
in
the
face
,
and
feel
that
he
do
so
.
<EOS>
Miss
Dunstable
be
treat
him
like
a
boy
.
<EOS>
while
she
pretend
to
be
so
fond
of
him
<EOS>
she
be
only
laugh
at
him
,
and
correspond
the
while
with
his
cousin
George

<EOS>
now
Frank
Gresham
already
entertain
a
sort
of
contempt
for
his
cousin
,
which
increase
the
bitterness
of
his
feeling

<EOS>
Could
it
really
be
possible
that
George
have
succeed
while
he
have
utterly
fail
;
that
his
stupid
cousin
have
touch
the
heart
of
the
heiress
while
she
be
play
with
him
as
with
a
boy

I
will
give
up
my
claim

"
  
<EOS>
and
then
he
sigh
again
,
so
that
it
be
piteous
to
hear
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
certainly
an
arrant
puppy
,
and
an
egregious
ass
into
the
bargain
;
but
then
,
it
must
be
remember
in
his
favour
that
he
be
only
twenty
-
one
,
and
that
much
have
be
do
to
spoil
him

<EOS>
Miss
Dunstable
do
remember
this
,
and
therefore
abstain
from
laugh
at
him

<EOS>
"
why

Mr
Gresham

what
on

do
you
mean

in

human
probability
I
shall
never
write
another
line
to
Mr

if
I
do

what
possible
harm
could
it
do
you

my

not
I

<EOS>
then
I
hope
I
never

I
think
I
do

<EOS>
I
think
they
be
the
feeling
of
a
good
,
true
-
hearted
friend
;
feeling
that
I
could
sometimes
look
back
upon
with
pleasure
as
be
honest
when
so
much
that
one
meet
be
false

<EOS>
I
have
become
very
fond
of
you

should
be
sorry

bad

young

like
Miss

she
be
still
to

number
in
the

not

tell

that
they
be
very
fond
of
them

<EOS>
to
boy

girl
they
may
make
such
a
declaration

<EOS>
now
Frank
Gresham
regard
himself
as
one
who
have
already
fight
his
battle
,
and
fight
them
not
without
glory
;
he
could
not
therefore
endure
to
be
thus
openly
tell
by
Miss
Dunstable
that
she
be
very
fond
of
him

<EOS>
"
fond

he
put
out
his

to
take
hold
of
her

<EOS>
She
then
lift
up
her
own

slap
him
lightly
on
the
knuckle

<EOS>
"

what
can
you
have
to

to
Miss

can
make
it
necessary

pinch
her

<EOS>
I
tell
you
fairly
,
Mr

,
if
you
make
a
fool
of
yourself

I
shall
come
to
a
conclusion
that
you
be
all
fool

that
it
be
hopeless
to
look
out
for
any

worth
care
for

<EOS>
such
advice

this

kindly
give

so
clearly
intelligible

should
have
take

do
not

She
now
put
out

not

soon
perceive

be
take
aback

so
appeal
to

that

could
not
any

find
the

He
have
to
make

understand
that

have
never
have
the
slight
idea

marry
her

that
he
have
make
love
to
her
merely
with
the
object

keep
his

work
as
it

there
be
nothing

He
be
goad

it
by
the
accusation

Miss

he
begin

that

,
no
good
could
now
come
from
her
interference
.
<EOS>
on
each
occasion
,
therefore
,
she
smile
sweetly
on
the
pair
of
turtle
-
dove
,
and
glide
out
of
the
room
as
quietly
as
she
have
glide
into
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
at
last
it
become
necessary
to
remove
them
;
for
the
world
have
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Frank
,
in
the
meantime
,
have
tell
to
Miss
Dunstable
all
his
love
for
Mary
Thorne
,
and
Miss
Dunstable
have
enjoin
him
to
be
true
to
his
vow
.
<EOS>
to
her
eye
there
be
something
of
heavenly
beauty
in
young
,
true
love
 
of
beauty
that
be
heavenly
because
it
have
be
unknown
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
mind
you
let
me
hear
,
Mr
Gresham
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
mind
you
do
;
and
,
Mr
Gresham
,
never
,
never
forget
her
for
one
moment
;
not
for
one
moment
,
Mr
Gresham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
be
about
to
swear
that
he
never
would
 
again
,
when
the
countess
,
for
the
third
time
,
sail
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
young
people
,
"
say
she
,
"
do
you
know
what
o'clock
it
be
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
dear
me
,
Lady
de
Courcy
,
I
declare
it
be
past
twelve
;
I
really
be
ashamed
of
myself
.
<EOS>
how
glad
you
will
be
to
get
rid
of
me
to
-
morrow
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
indeed
we
shall
not
;
<EOS>
shall
we
,
Frank
?
"
<EOS>
and
so
Miss
Dunstable
pass
out
.
  
<EOS>
then
once
again
the
aunt
tap
her
nephew
with
her
fan
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
last
time
in
her
life
that
she
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
look
up
in
her
face
,
and
his
look
be
enough
to
tell
her
that
the
acre
of
Greshamsbury
be
not
to
be
reclaim
by
the
ointment
of
Lebanon
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
further
on
the
subject
be
say
.
<EOS>
on
the
follow
morning
Miss
Dunstable
take
her
departure
,
not
much
heed
the
rather
cold
word
of
farewell
which
her
hostess
give
her
;
and
on
the
follow
day
Frank
start
for
Greshamsbury
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Moffat
Falls
into
Trouble
 
<EOS>
We
will
now
,
with
the
reader
's
kind
permission
,
skip
over
some
month
in
our
narrative
.
<EOS>
Frank
return
from
Courcy
Castle
to
Greshamsbury
,
and
have
communicate
to
his
mother
 
much
in
the
same
manner
as
he
have
to
the
countess
 
<EOS>
the
fact
that
his
mission
have
be
unsuccessful
<EOS>
,
he
go
up
after
a
day
or
two
to
Cambridge
.
<EOS>
during
his
short
stay
at
Greshamsbury
he
do
not
even
catch
a
glimpse
of
Mary
.
<EOS>
He
ask
for
her
,
of
course
,
and
be
tell
that
it
be
not
likely
that
she
would
be
at
the
house
just
at
present
.
<EOS>
He
call
at
the
doctor
's
,
but
she
be
deny
to
him
there
;
"
she
be
out
,
"
Janet
say
,
 
"
probably
with
Miss
Oriel
.
"
<EOS>
He
go
to
the
parsonage
and
find
Miss
Oriel
at
home
;
but
Mary
have
not
be
see
that
morning
.
<EOS>
He
then
return
to
the
house
;
and
,
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
she
have
not
thus
vanish
into
air
,
otherwise
than
by
preconcerte
arrangement
,
he
boldly
tax
Beatrice
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
Beatrice
look
very
demure
;
declare
that
no
one
in
the
house
have
quarrel
with
Mary
;
confess
that
it
have
be
think
prudent
<EOS>
that
she
should
for
a
while
stay
away
from
Greshamsbury
;
and
,
of
course
,
end
by
tell
her
brother
everything
,
include
all
the
scene
that
have
pass
between
Mary
and
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
out
of
the
question
your
thinking
of
marry
her
,
Frank
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
that
nobody
feel
it
more
strongly
than
poor
Mary
herself
;
"
and
Beatrice
look
the
very
personification
of
domestic
prudence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
of
the
kind
,
"
say
he
,
with
the
headlong
imperative
air
that
be
usual
with
him
in
discuss
matter
with
his
sister
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
can
not
say
what
Mary
's
feeling
may
be
:
a
pretty
life
she
must
have
have
of
it
among
you
.
<EOS>
but
you
may
be
sure
of
this
,
Beatrice
,
and
<EOS>
so
may
my
mother
,
that
nothing
on
earth
shall
make
me
give
her
up
 
nothing
.
"
<EOS>
and
Frank
,
as
he
make
the
protestation
,
strengthen
his
own
resolution
by
think
of
all
the
counsel
that
Miss
Dunstable
have
give
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
brother
and
sister
could
hardly
agree
,
as
Beatrice
be
dead
against
the
match
.
<EOS>
not
that
she
would
not
have
like
Mary
Thorne
for
a
sister
-
in
-
law
,
but
that
she
share
to
a
certain
degree
the
feeling
which
be
now
common
to
all
the
Greshams
 
that
Frank
must
marry
money
.
<EOS>
It
seem
,
at
any
rate
,
to
be
imperative
that
he
should
either
do
that
or
not
marry
at
all
.
<EOS>
poor
Beatrice
be
not
very
mercenary
in
her
view
:
she
have
no
wish
to
sacrifice
her
brother
to
any
Miss
Dunstable
;
but
yet
she
feel
,
as
they
all
feel
 
Mary
Thorne
include
 
that
such
a
match
as
that
,
of
the
young
heir
with
the
doctor
's
niece
,
be
not
to
be
think
of
;
 
not
to
be
speak
of
as
a
thing
that
be
in
any
way
possible
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
Beatrice
,
though
she
be
Mary
's
great
friend
,
though
she
be
her
brother
's
favourite
sister
,
could
give
Frank
no
encouragement
.
<EOS>
poor
Frank
!
<EOS>
circumstance
have
make
but
one
bride
possible
to
him
:
he
must
marry
money
.
  
<EOS>
His
mother
say
nothing
to
him
on
the
subject
:
when
she
learn
that
the
affair
with
Miss
Dunstable
be
not
to
come
off
,
she
merely
remark
that
it
would
perhaps
be
good
for
him
to
return
to
Cambridge
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
have
she
speak
her
mind
out
,
she
would
probably
have
also
advise
him
to
remain
there
as
long
as
possible
.
<EOS>
the
countess
have
not
omit
to
write
to
her
when
Frank
leave
Courcy
Castle
;
and
the
countess
's
letter
certainly
make
the
anxious
mother
think
that
her
son
's
education
have
hardly
yet
be
complete
.
<EOS>
with
this
secondary
object
,
but
with
that
of
keep
him
out
of
the
way
of
Mary
Thorne
in
the
first
place
,
Lady
Arabella
be
now
quite
satisfied
that
her
son
should
enjoy
such
advantage
as
an
education
complete
at
the
university
may
give
him
.
  
<EOS>
with
his
father
Frank
have
a
long
conversation
;
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
the
gist
of
his
father
's
conversation
be
this
,
that
it
behove
him
,
Frank
,
to
marry
money
.
<EOS>
the
father
,
however
,
do
not
put
it
to
him
in
the
cold
,
callous
way
in
which
his
lady
-
aunt
have
do
,
and
his
lady
-
mother
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
bid
him
go
and
sell
himself
to
the
first
female
he
could
find
possess
of
wealth
.
<EOS>
It
be
with
inward
self
-
reproach
,
and
true
grief
of
spirit
,
that
the
father
tell
the
son
that
it
be
not
possible
for
him
to
do
as
those
may
do
who
be
bear
really
rich
,
or
really
poor
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
marry
a
girl
without
a
fortune
,
Frank
,
how
be
you
to
live
?
<EOS>
"
the
father
ask
,
after
have
confess
how
deep
he
himself
have
injure
his
own
heir
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
about
money
,
sir
,
"
say
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
just
as
happy
as
if
Boxall
Hill
have
never
be
sell
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
a
straw
about
that
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
my
boy
<EOS>
;
but
you
will
care
:
you
will
soon
find
that
you
do
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
go
into
some
profession
.
<EOS>
let
me
go
to
the
Bar
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
could
earn
my
own
living
.
<EOS>
earn
it
!
<EOS>
of
course
I
could
,
why
not
I
as
well
as
other
?
<EOS>
I
should
like
of
all
thing
to
be
a
barrister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
much
more
of
the
same
kind
,
in
which
Frank
say
all
that
he
could
think
of
to
lessen
his
father
's
regret
.
<EOS>
in
their
conversation
not
a
word
be
speak
about
Mary
Thorne
.
<EOS>
Frank
be
not
aware
whether
or
no
his
father
have
be
tell
of
the
great
family
danger
which
be
dread
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
that
he
have
be
tell
,
we
may
surmise
,
as
Lady
Arabella
be
not
will
not
to
confine
the
family
danger
to
her
own
bosom
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
Mary
's
presence
have
,
of
course
,
be
miss
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
that
the
squire
have
be
tell
,
with
great
bitterness
,
of
what
have
come
to
pass
,
and
all
the
evil
have
be
lay
at
his
door
.
<EOS>
He
it
have
be
who
have
encourage
Mary
to
be
regard
almost
as
a
daughter
of
the
house
of
Greshamsbury
;
he
<EOS>
it
be
who
teach
that
odious
doctor
 
odious
in
all
but
his
aptitude
for
good
doctoring
 
to
think
himself
a
fit
match
for
the
aristocracy
of
the
county
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
his
fault
,
this
great
necessity
that
Frank
should
marry
money
;
and
now
it
be
his
fault
that
Frank
be
absolutely
talk
of
marry
a
pauper
.
  
<EOS>
by
no
mean
in
quiescence
do
the
squire
hear
these
charge
bring
against
him
.
<EOS>
the
Lady
Arabella
,
in
each
attack
,
get
quite
as
much
as
she
give
,
and
,
at
last
,
be
drive
to
retreat
in
a
state
of
headache
,
which
she
declare
to
be
chronic
;
and
which
,
so
she
assure
her
daughter
Augusta
,
must
prevent
her
from
have
any
more
lengthen
conversation
with
her
lord
 
at
any
rate
for
the
next
three
month
.
<EOS>
but
though
the
squire
may
be
say
to
have
come
off
on
the
whole
as
victor
in
these
combat
,
they
do
not
perhaps
have
,
on
that
account
,
the
less
effect
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
know
it
be
true
that
he
have
do
much
towards
ruin
his
son
;
and
he
also
could
think
of
no
other
remedy
than
matrimony
.
<EOS>
It
be
Frank
's
doom
,
pronounce
even
by
the
voice
of
his
father
,
that
he
must
marry
money
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
,
Frank
go
off
again
to
Cambridge
,
feel
himself
,
as
he
go
,
to
be
a
much
less
man
in
Greshamsbury
estimation
than
he
have
be
some
two
month
earlier
,
when
his
birthday
have
be
celebrate
.
<EOS>
once
during
his
short
stay
at
Greshamsbury
he
have
see
the
doctor
;
but
the
meeting
have
be
anything
but
pleasant
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
afraid
to
ask
after
Mary
;
and
the
doctor
have
be
too
diffident
of
himself
to
speak
of
her
.
<EOS>
They
have
meet
casually
on
the
road
,
and
,
though
each
in
his
heart
love
the
other
,
the
meeting
have
be
anything
but
pleasant
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
Frank
go
back
to
Cambridge
;
and
,
as
he
do
so
,
he
stoutly
resolve
that
nothing
should
make
him
untrue
to
Mary
Thorne
.
<EOS>
"
Beatrice
,
"
say
he
,
on
the
morning
he
go
away
,
when
she
come
into
his
room
to
superintend
his
packing
 
<EOS>
"
Beatrice
,
if
she
ever
talk
about
me
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
oh
,
Frank
,
my
darling
Frank
,
do
not
think
of
it
 
<EOS>
it
be
madness
;
she
know
it
be
madness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
never
mind
;
if
she
ever
talk
about
me
,
tell
her
that
the
last
word
I
say
be
,
that
I
would
never
forget
her
.
<EOS>
She
can
do
as
she
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
Beatrice
make
no
promise
,
never
hint
that
she
would
give
the
message
;
but
it
may
be
take
for
grant
that
she
have
not
be
long
in
company
with
Mary
Thorne
before
she
do
give
it
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
there
be
other
trouble
at
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
decide
that
Augusta
's
marriage
be
to
take
place
in
September
;
but
Mr
Moffat
have
,
unfortunately
,
be
oblige
to
postpone
the
happy
day
.
<EOS>
He
himself
have
tell
Augusta
 
not
,
of
course
,
without
protestation
as
to
his
regret
 
and
have
write
to
this
effect
to
Mr
Gresham
,
"
electioneer
matter
,
and
other
trouble
<EOS>
have
,
"
he
say
,
"
make
this
peculiarly
painful
postponement
absolutely
necessary
.
"
  
<EOS>
Augusta
seem
to
bear
her
misfortune
with
more
equanimity
than
be
,
we
believe
,
usual
with
young
lady
under
such
circumstance
.
<EOS>
She
speak
of
it
to
her
mother
in
a
very
matter
-
of
-
fact
way
,
and
seem
almost
contented
at
the
idea
of
remain
at
Greshamsbury
till
February
;
which
be
the
time
now
name
for
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
but
Lady
Arabella
be
not
equally
well
satisfied
,
nor
be
the
squire
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
half
believe
that
fellow
be
not
honest
,
"
he
have
once
say
out
loud
before
Frank
,
and
this
set
Frank
a
-
thinking
of
what
dishonesty
in
the
matter
it
be
probable
that
Mr
Moffat
may
be
guilty
,
and
what
would
be
the
fitting
punishment
for
such
a
crime
.
<EOS>
nor
do
he
think
on
the
subject
in
vain
;
especially
after
a
conference
on
the
matter
which
he
have
with
his
friend
Harry
Baker
.
<EOS>
this
conference
take
place
during
the
Christmas
vacation
.
  
<EOS>
It
should
be
mention
,
that
the
time
spend
by
Frank
at
Courcy
Castle
have
not
do
much
to
assist
him
in
his
view
as
to
an
early
degree
,
and
that
it
have
at
last
be
settle
that
he
should
stay
up
at
Cambridge
another
year
.
<EOS>
when
he
come
home
at
Christmas
he
find
that
the
house
be
not
peculiarly
lively
.
<EOS>
Mary
be
absent
on
a
visit
with
Miss
Oriel
.
<EOS>
both
these
young
lady
be
stay
with
Miss
Oriel
's
aunt
,
in
the
neighbourhood
of
London
;
and
Frank
soon
learn
that
there
be
no
chance
that
either
of
them
would
be
home
before
his
return
.
<EOS>
no
message
have
be
leave
for
him
by
Mary
 
<EOS>
none
at
least
have
be
leave
with
Beatrice
;
and
he
begin
in
his
heart
to
accuse
her
of
coldness
and
perfidy
;
 
not
,
certainly
,
with
much
justice
,
see
that
she
have
never
give
him
the
slight
encouragement
.
  
<EOS>
the
absence
of
Patience
Oriel
add
to
the
dullness
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
hard
upon
Frank
that
all
the
attraction
of
the
village
should
be
remove
to
make
way
and
prepare
for
his
return
 
harder
,
perhaps
,
on
them
;
for
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
Miss
Oriel
's
visit
have
be
entirely
plan
to
enable
her
to
give
Mary
a
comfortable
way
of
leave
Greshamsbury
during
the
time
that
Frank
should
remain
at
home
.
<EOS>
Frank
think
himself
cruelly
use
.
<EOS>
but
what
do
Mr
Oriel
think
when
doom
to
eat
his
Christmas
pudding
alone
,
because
the
young
squire
would
be
unreasonable
in
his
love
?
<EOS>
what
do
the
doctor
think
,
as
he
sit
solitary
by
his
desert
hearth
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
who
no
longer
permit
himself
to
enjoy
the
comfort
of
the
Greshamsbury
dining
-
table
?
<EOS>
Frank
hint
and
grumble
;
talk
to
Beatrice
of
the
determined
constancy
of
his
love
,
and
occasionally
console
himself
by
a
stray
smile
from
some
of
the
neighbouring
belle
.
<EOS>
the
black
horse
be
make
perfect
;
the
old
grey
pony
be
by
no
mean
discard
;
and
much
that
be
satisfactory
be
do
in
the
sporting
line
.
<EOS>
but
still
the
house
be
dull
,
and
Frank
feel
that
he
be
the
cause
of
its
be
so
.
<EOS>
of
the
doctor
he
see
but
little
:
he
never
come
to
Greshamsbury
unless
to
see
Lady
Arabella
as
doctor
,
or
to
be
closet
with
the
squire
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
social
evening
with
him
;
no
animate
confabulation
at
the
doctor
's
house
;
no
discourse
between
them
,
as
there
have
will
not
to
be
,
about
the
merit
of
the
different
cover
,
and
the
capacity
of
the
different
hound
.
<EOS>
these
be
dull
day
on
the
whole
for
Frank
;
and
sad
enough
,
we
may
say
,
for
our
friend
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
in
February
,
Frank
again
go
back
to
college
;
have
settle
with
Harry
Baker
certain
affair
which
weigh
on
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
go
back
to
Cambridge
,
promise
to
be
home
on
the
20th
of
the
month
,
so
as
to
be
present
at
his
sister
's
wedding
.
<EOS>
a
cold
and
chilling
time
have
be
name
for
these
hymeneal
joy
,
but
one
not
altogether
unsuited
to
the
feeling
of
the
happy
pair
.
<EOS>
February
be
certainly
not
a
warm
month
;
but
with
the
rich
it
be
generally
a
cosy
,
comfortable
time
.
<EOS>
good
fire
,
winter
cheer
,
groaning
table
,
and
warm
blanket
,
make
a
fictitious
summer
,
which
,
to
some
taste
,
be
more
delightful
than
the
long
day
and
the
hot
sun
.
<EOS>
and
some
marriage
be
especially
winter
match
.
<EOS>
They
depend
for
their
charm
on
the
same
substantial
attraction
:
instead
of
heart
beat
to
heart
in
sympathetic
unison
,
purse
chink
to
purse
.
<EOS>
the
rich
new
furniture
of
the
new
abode
be
look
to
instead
of
the
rapture
of
a
pure
embrace
.
<EOS>
the
new
carriage
be
depend
on
rather
than
the
new
heart
's
companion
;
and
the
first
bright
gloss
,
prepare
by
the
upholsterer
's
hand
,
stand
in
lieu
of
the
rosy
tint
which
young
love
lend
to
his
true
votary
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Moffat
have
not
spend
his
Christmas
at
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
that
eternal
election
petition
,
those
eternal
lawyer
,
the
eternal
care
of
his
well
-
manage
wealth
,
forbid
him
the
enjoyment
of
any
such
pleasure
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
come
to
Greshamsbury
for
Christmas
,
nor
yet
for
the
festivity
of
the
new
year
;
but
now
<EOS>
and
then
he
write
prettily
word
note
,
send
occasionally
a
silver
-
gilt
pencil
-
case
,
or
a
small
brooch
,
and
inform
Lady
Arabella
that
he
look
forward
to
the
20th
of
February
with
great
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
the
squire
become
anxious
,
and
at
last
go
up
to
London
;
and
Frank
,
who
be
at
Cambridge
,
buy
the
heavy
cut
whip
to
be
find
in
that
town
,
and
write
a
confidential
letter
to
Harry
Baker
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr
Moffat
!
<EOS>
It
be
well
known
that
none
but
the
brave
deserve
the
fair
;
but
thou
,
without
much
excuse
for
bravery
,
have
secure
for
thyself
one
who
,
at
any
rate
,
be
fair
enough
for
thee
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
have
be
well
hadst
<EOS>
thou
look
into
thyself
to
see
what
real
bravery
may
be
in
thee
,
before
thou
hadst
prepare
to
desert
this
fair
one
thou
hadst
already
win
?
<EOS>
that
last
achievement
,
one
may
say
,
do
require
some
special
courage
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr
Moffat
!
<EOS>
It
be
wonderful
that
as
he
sit
in
that
gig
,
go
to
Gatherum
Castle
,
plan
how
he
would
be
off
with
Miss
Gresham
and
afterwards
on
with
Miss
Dunstable
,
it
be
wonderful
that
he
should
not
then
have
cast
his
eye
behind
him
,
and
look
at
that
stalwart
pair
of
shoulder
which
be
so
close
to
his
own
back
.
<EOS>
as
he
afterwards
ponder
on
his
scheme
while
sip
the
duke
's
claret
,
it
be
odd
that
he
should
not
have
observe
the
fiery
pride
of
purpose
and
power
of
wrath
which
be
so
plainly
write
on
that
young
man
's
brow
:
<EOS>
or
,
when
he
mature
,
and
finish
,
and
carry
out
his
purpose
,
that
he
do
not
think
of
that
keen
grasp
which
have
already
squeeze
his
own
hand
with
somewhat
too
warm
a
vigour
,
even
in
the
way
of
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr
Moffat
!
<EOS>
it
be
probable
that
he
forget
to
think
of
Frank
at
all
as
connect
with
his
promised
bride
;
it
be
probable
that
he
look
forward
only
to
the
squire
's
violence
and
the
enmity
of
the
house
of
Courcy
;
and
that
he
find
from
enquiry
at
his
heart
's
pulse
,
that
he
be
man
enough
to
meet
these
.
<EOS>
Could
he
have
guess
what
a
whip
Frank
Gresham
would
have
buy
at
Cambridge
 
could
he
have
divine
what
a
letter
would
have
be
write
to
Harry
Baker
 
<EOS>
it
be
probable
<EOS>
,
nay
,
we
think
we
may
say
certain
,
that
Miss
Gresham
would
have
become
Mrs
Moffat
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Gresham
,
however
,
never
do
become
Mrs
Moffat
.
<EOS>
about
two
day
after
Frank
's
departure
for
Cambridge
 
<EOS>
it
be
just
possible
that
Mr
Moffat
be
so
prudent
as
to
make
himself
aware
of
the
fact
 
but
just
two
day
after
Frank
's
departure
,
a
very
long
,
elaborate
,
and
clearly
explanatory
letter
be
receive
at
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
Mr
Moffat
be
quite
sure
that
Miss
Gresham
and
her
very
excellent
parent
would
do
him
the
justice
to
believe
that
he
be
not
actuate
,
&
c.
,
&
c.
,
&
<EOS>
c.
the
long
and
the
short
of
this
be
,
that
Mr
Moffat
signify
his
intention
of
break
off
the
match
without
offer
any
intelligible
reason
.
  
<EOS>
Augusta
again
bear
her
disappointment
well
:
not
,
indeed
,
without
sorrow
and
heartache
,
and
inward
,
hide
tear
;
but
still
well
.
<EOS>
She
neither
rave
,
nor
faint
,
nor
walk
about
by
moonlight
alone
.
<EOS>
She
write
no
poetry
,
and
never
once
thought
of
suicide
.
<EOS>
when
,
indeed
,
she
remember
the
rosy
-
tint
lining
,
the
unfathomable
softness
of
that
Long
-
acre
carriage
,
her
spirit
do
for
one
moment
give
way
;
but
,
on
the
whole
,
she
bear
it
as
a
strong
-
minded
woman
and
a
de
Courcy
should
do
.
  
<EOS>
but
both
Lady
Arabella
and
the
squire
be
greatly
vexed
.
<EOS>
the
former
have
make
the
match
,
and
the
latter
,
have
consent
to
it
,
have
incur
deep
responsibility
to
enable
him
to
bring
it
about
.
<EOS>
the
money
which
be
to
have
be
give
to
Mr
Moffat
be
still
to
the
fore
;
but
alas
!
<EOS>
how
much
,
how
much
that
he
could
ill
spare
,
have
be
throw
away
on
bridal
preparation
!
<EOS>
It
be
,
moreover
,
an
unpleasant
thing
for
a
gentleman
to
have
his
daughter
jilt
;
perhaps
peculiarly
so
to
have
her
jilt
by
a
tailor
's
son
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
's
woe
be
really
piteous
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
her
as
though
cruel
fate
be
heap
misery
after
misery
upon
the
wretched
house
of
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
a
few
week
since
thing
be
go
so
well
with
her
!
<EOS>
Frank
then
be
all
but
the
accepted
husband
of
almost
untold
wealth
 
<EOS>
so
,
at
least
,
she
be
inform
by
her
sister
-
in
-
law
 
<EOS>
whereas
,
Augusta
,
be
the
accept
wife
of
wealth
,
not
indeed
untold
,
but
of
dimension
quite
sufficiently
respectable
to
cause
much
joy
in
the
telling
.
<EOS>
where
now
be
her
golden
hope
?
<EOS>
where
now
the
splendid
future
of
her
poor
duped
child
?
<EOS>
Augusta
be
leave
to
pine
alone
;
and
Frank
,
in
a
still
bad
plight
,
insist
on
maintain
his
love
for
a
bastard
and
a
pauper
.
  
<EOS>
for
Frank
's
affair
she
have
receive
some
poor
consolation
by
lay
all
the
blame
on
the
squire
's
shoulder
.
<EOS>
what
she
have
then
say
be
now
repay
to
her
with
interest
;
for
not
only
have
she
be
the
maker
of
Augusta
's
match
,
but
she
have
boast
of
the
deed
with
all
a
mother
's
pride
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
from
Beatrice
that
Frank
have
obtain
his
tiding
.
<EOS>
this
last
resolve
on
the
part
of
Mr
Moffat
have
not
altogether
be
unsuspected
by
some
of
the
Greshams
,
though
altogether
unsuspecte
by
the
Lady
Arabella
.
<EOS>
Frank
have
speak
of
it
as
a
possibility
to
Beatrice
,
and
be
not
quite
unprepared
when
the
information
reach
him
.
<EOS>
He
consequently
buy
his
big
cutting
whip
,
and
write
his
confidential
letter
to
Harry
Baker
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
follow
day
Frank
and
Harry
may
have
be
see
,
with
their
head
nearly
close
together
,
lean
over
one
of
the
table
in
the
large
breakfast
-
room
at
the
Tavistock
Hotel
in
Covent
Garden
.
<EOS>
the
ominous
whip
,
to
the
handle
of
which
Frank
have
already
make
his
hand
well
accustomed
,
be
lie
on
the
table
between
them
;
and
ever
and
anon
Harry
Baker
would
take
it
up
and
feel
its
weight
approvingly
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Mr
Moffat
!
<EOS>
poor
Mr
Moffat
!
<EOS>
go
not
out
into
the
fashionable
world
to
-
day
;
above
all
,
go
not
to
that
club
of
thine
in
Pall
Mall
;
but
,
oh
!
<EOS>
especially
go
not
there
,
as
be
thy
will
not
to
do
,
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
!
  
<EOS>
with
much
care
do
those
two
young
general
lie
their
plan
of
attack
.
<EOS>
let
it
not
for
a
moment
be
think
that
it
be
ever
in
the
mind
of
either
of
them
that
two
man
should
attack
one
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
think
that
Mr
Moffat
may
be
rather
coy
in
come
out
from
his
seclusion
to
meet
the
proffer
hand
of
his
once
intend
brother
-
in
-
law
when
he
should
see
that
hand
arm
with
a
heavy
whip
.
<EOS>
Baker
,
therefore
,
be
content
to
act
as
a
decoy
duck
,
and
remark
that
he
may
no
doubt
make
himself
useful
in
restrain
the
public
mercy
,
and
,
probably
,
in
control
the
interference
of
policeman
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
deuce
hard
if
I
can
not
get
five
or
six
shy
at
him
,
"
say
Frank
,
again
clutch
his
weapon
almost
spasmodically
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Mr
Moffat
!
<EOS>
five
or
six
shy
with
such
a
whip
,
and
such
an
arm
!
<EOS>
for
myself
,
I
would
sooner
join
in
a
second
Balaclava
gallop
than
encounter
it
.
  
<EOS>
at
ten
minute
before
four
these
two
hero
may
be
see
walk
up
Pall
Mall
,
towards
the
 
---
Club
.
<EOS>
young
Baker
walk
with
an
eager
disengaged
air
.
<EOS>
Mr
Moffat
do
not
know
his
appearance
;
he
have
,
therefore
,
no
anxiety
to
pass
along
unnoticed
.
<EOS>
but
Frank
have
in
some
mysterious
way
draw
his
hat
very
far
over
his
forehead
,
and
have
button
his
shooting
-
coat
up
round
his
chin
.
<EOS>
Harry
have
recommend
to
him
a
great
-
coat
,
in
order
that
he
may
the
well
conceal
his
face
;
but
Frank
have
find
that
the
great
-
coat
be
an
encumbrance
to
his
arm
.
<EOS>
He
put
it
on
,
and
when
thus
clothe
he
have
try
the
whip
,
he
find
that
he
cut
the
air
with
much
less
potency
than
in
the
light
garment
.
<EOS>
He
content
himself
,
therefore
,
with
look
down
on
the
pavement
as
he
walk
along
,
let
the
long
point
of
the
whip
stick
up
from
his
pocket
,
and
flatter
himself
that
even
Mr
Moffat
would
not
recognise
him
at
the
first
glance
.
<EOS>
poor
Mr
Moffat
!
<EOS>
if
he
have
but
have
the
chance
!
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
have
arrive
at
the
front
of
the
club
,
the
two
friend
for
a
moment
separate
:
<EOS>
Frank
remain
stand
on
the
pavement
,
under
the
shade
of
the
high
stone
area
-
rail
,
while
Harry
jauntily
skip
up
three
step
at
a
time
,
and
with
a
very
civil
word
of
inquiry
of
the
hall
porter
,
send
in
his
card
to
Mr
Moffat
    
<EOS>
MR
HARRY
BAKER
  
Mr
Moffat
,
never
have
hear
of
such
a
gentleman
in
his
life
,
unwittingly
come
out
into
the
hall
,
and
Harry
,
with
the
sweetest
smile
,
address
him
.
  
<EOS>
now
the
plan
of
the
campaign
have
be
settle
in
this
wise
<EOS>
:
Baker
be
to
send
into
the
club
for
Mr
Moffat
,
and
invite
that
gentleman
down
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
It
be
probable
that
the
invitation
may
be
decline
;
and
it
have
be
calculate
in
such
case
that
the
two
gentleman
would
retire
for
parley
into
the
stranger
"
room
,
which
be
know
to
be
immediately
opposite
the
hall
door
.
<EOS>
Frank
be
to
keep
his
eye
on
the
portal
,
and
if
he
find
that
Mr
Moffat
do
not
appear
as
readily
as
may
be
desire
,
he
also
be
to
ascend
the
step
and
hurry
into
the
stranger
<EOS>
"
room
.
<EOS>
then
,
whether
he
meet
Mr
Moffat
there
or
elsewhere
,
or
wherever
he
may
meet
him
,
he
be
to
greet
him
with
all
the
friendly
vigour
in
his
power
,
while
Harry
dispose
of
the
club
porter
.
  
<EOS>
but
fortune
,
who
ever
favour
the
brave
,
specially
favour
Frank
Gresham
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
just
as
Harry
Baker
have
put
his
card
into
the
servant
's
hand
,
Mr
Moffat
,
with
his
hat
on
,
prepare
for
the
street
,
appear
in
the
hall
;
Mr
Baker
address
him
with
his
sweetest
smile
,
and
beg
the
pleasure
of
say
a
word
or
two
as
they
descend
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
have
not
Mr
Moffat
be
go
thither
<EOS>
it
would
have
be
very
improbable
that
he
should
have
do
so
at
Harry
's
instance
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
it
be
,
he
merely
look
rather
solemn
at
his
visitor
 
<EOS>
it
be
his
will
not
to
look
solemn
 
and
continue
the
descent
of
the
step
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
,
his
heart
leap
the
while
,
see
his
prey
,
and
retreat
two
step
behind
the
area
-
rail
,
the
dread
weapon
already
well
poise
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Mr
Moffat
!
<EOS>
Mr
Moffat
!
<EOS>
if
there
be
any
goddess
to
interfere
in
thy
favour
,
let
her
come
forward
now
without
delay
;
let
her
now
bear
thee
off
on
a
cloud
if
there
be
one
to
whom
thou
art
sufficiently
dear
!
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
such
goddess
.
  
<EOS>
Harry
smile
blandly
till
they
be
well
on
the
pavement
,
say
some
nothing
,
and
keep
the
victim
's
face
avert
from
the
avenge
angel
;
and
then
,
when
the
raise
hand
be
sufficiently
nigh
,
he
withdraw
two
step
towards
the
near
lamp
-
post
.
<EOS>
not
for
him
be
the
honour
of
the
interview
;
 
unless
,
indeed
,
succour
policeman
may
give
occasion
for
some
gleam
of
glory
.
  
<EOS>
but
succour
policeman
be
no
more
to
be
come
by
than
goddess
.
<EOS>
where
be
ye
,
man
,
when
that
savage
whip
fall
about
the
ear
of
the
poor
ex
-
legislator
?
<EOS>
in
Scotland
Yard
,
sit
doze
on
your
bench
,
or
talk
soft
nothing
to
the
housemaid
round
the
corner
;
for
ye
be
not
walk
on
your
beat
,
nor
stand
at
coign
of
vantage
,
to
watch
the
tumult
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
but
have
ye
be
there
what
could
ye
have
do
?
<EOS>
have
Sir
Richard
himself
be
on
the
spot
Frank
Gresham
would
still
,
we
may
say
,
have
have
his
five
shy
at
that
unfortunate
one
.
  
<EOS>
when
Harry
Baker
quickly
secede
from
the
way
,
Mr
Moffat
at
once
see
the
fate
before
him
.
<EOS>
His
hair
doubtless
stand
on
end
,
and
his
voice
refuse
to
give
the
loud
screech
with
which
he
seek
to
invoke
the
club
.
<EOS>
an
ashy
paleness
suffuse
his
cheek
,
and
his
tottering
step
be
unable
to
bear
him
away
in
flight
.
<EOS>
once
,
and
twice
,
the
cut
whip
come
well
down
across
his
back
.
<EOS>
have
he
be
wise
enough
to
stand
still
and
take
his
thrashing
in
that
attitude
,
it
would
have
be
well
for
him
.
<EOS>
but
man
so
circumstance
have
never
such
prudence
.
<EOS>
after
two
blow
he
make
a
dash
at
the
step
,
think
to
get
back
into
the
club
;
but
Harry
,
who
have
by
no
mean
recline
in
idleness
against
the
lamp
-
post
,
here
stop
him
:
"
You
have
better
go
back
into
the
street
,
"
say
Harry
;
"
indeed
you
have
,
"
give
him
a
shove
from
off
the
second
step
.
  
<EOS>
then
of
course
Frank
could
not
do
other
than
hit
him
anywhere
.
<EOS>
when
a
gentleman
be
dance
about
with
much
energy
it
be
hardly
possible
to
strike
him
fairly
on
his
back
.
<EOS>
the
blow
,
therefore
,
come
now
on
his
leg
and
now
on
his
head
;
and
Frank
unfortunately
get
more
than
his
five
or
six
shy
before
he
be
interrupt
.
  
<EOS>
the
interruption
however
come
,
all
too
soon
for
Frank
's
idea
of
justice
.
<EOS>
though
there
be
no
policeman
to
take
part
in
a
London
row
,
there
be
always
other
ready
enough
to
do
so
;
amateur
policeman
,
who
generally
sympathise
with
the
wrong
side
,
and
,
in
nine
case
out
of
ten
,
expend
their
generous
energy
in
protect
thief
and
pickpocket
.
<EOS>
when
it
be
see
with
what
tremendous
ardour
that
dread
weapon
fall
about
the
ear
of
the
poor
undefended
gentleman
,
interference
there
be
at
last
,
in
spite
of
Harry
Baker
's
good
endeavour
,
and
loud
protestation
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
interrupt
them
,
sir
,
"
say
he
;
"
pray
do
not
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
family
affair
,
and
they
will
neither
of
them
like
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
the
tooth
,
however
,
of
these
assurance
,
rude
people
do
interfere
,
and
after
some
nine
or
ten
shy
Frank
find
himself
encompass
by
the
arm
,
and
encumber
by
the
weight
of
a
very
stout
gentleman
,
who
hang
affectionately
about
his
neck
and
shoulder
;
whereas
,
Mr
Moffat
be
already
receive
consolation
from
two
motherly
female
,
sit
in
a
state
of
syncope
on
the
good
-
natured
knee
of
a
fishmonger
's
apprentice
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
be
thoroughly
out
of
breath
:
nothing
come
from
his
lip
but
half
-
muttered
expletive
and
unintelligible
denunciation
of
the
iniquity
of
his
foe
.
<EOS>
but
still
he
struggle
to
be
at
him
again
.
<EOS>
We
all
know
how
dangerous
be
the
taste
of
blood
;
now
cruelty
will
become
a
custom
even
with
the
most
tender
-
hearted
.
<EOS>
Frank
feel
that
he
have
hardly
flesh
his
virgin
lash
:
he
think
,
almost
with
despair
,
that
he
have
not
yet
at
all
succeed
as
become
a
man
and
a
brother
;
his
memory
tell
him
of
<EOS>
but
one
or
two
of
the
slight
touch
that
have
go
well
home
to
the
offender
.
<EOS>
He
make
a
desperate
effort
to
throw
off
that
incubus
round
his
neck
and
rush
again
to
the
combat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Harry
 
Harry
;
do
not
let
him
go
 
<EOS>
do
not
let
him
go
,
"
he
barely
articulate
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
want
to
murder
the
man
,
sir
;
to
murder
him
?
"
say
the
stout
gentleman
over
his
shoulder
,
speak
solemnly
into
his
very
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
,
"
say
Frank
,
struggle
manfully
but
uselessly
.
<EOS>
"
let
me
out
,
I
say
;
I
do
not
care
 
<EOS>
do
not
let
him
go
,
Harry
,
whatever
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
get
it
prettily
tidily
,
"
say
Harry
;
"
I
think
that
will
perhaps
do
for
the
present
.
"
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
there
be
a
considerable
concourse
.
<EOS>
the
club
step
be
crowd
with
the
member
;
among
whom
there
be
many
of
Mr
Moffat
's
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
policeman
also
now
flock
up
,
and
the
question
arise
as
to
what
should
be
do
with
the
originator
of
the
affray
.
<EOS>
Frank
and
Harry
find
that
they
be
to
consider
themselves
under
a
gentle
arrest
,
and
Mr
Moffat
,
in
a
faint
state
,
be
carry
into
the
interior
of
the
club
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
,
in
his
innocence
,
have
intend
to
have
celebrate
this
little
affair
when
it
be
over
by
a
light
repast
and
a
bottle
of
claret
with
his
friend
,
and
then
to
have
go
back
to
Cambridge
by
the
mail
train
.
<EOS>
He
find
,
however
,
that
his
scheme
in
this
respect
be
frustrate
.
<EOS>
He
have
to
get
bail
to
attend
at
Marlborough
Street
police
-
office
<EOS>
should
he
be
want
within
the
next
two
or
three
day
;
and
be
give
to
understand
that
he
would
be
under
the
eye
of
the
police
,
at
any
rate
until
Mr
Moffat
should
be
out
of
danger
.
  
<EOS>
"
out
of
danger
!
"
say
Frank
to
his
friend
with
a
startled
look
.
<EOS>
"
why
I
hardly
get
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
they
do
have
their
slight
repast
,
and
also
their
bottle
of
claret
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
second
morning
after
this
occurrence
,
Frank
be
again
sit
in
that
public
room
at
the
Tavistock
,
and
Harry
be
again
sit
opposite
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
whip
be
not
now
so
conspicuously
produce
between
them
,
have
be
carefully
pack
up
and
put
away
among
Frank
's
other
travel
property
.
<EOS>
They
be
so
sit
,
rather
glum
,
when
the
door
swing
open
,
and
a
heavy
,
quick
step
be
hear
advance
towards
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
squire
;
whose
arrival
there
have
be
momentarily
expect
.
  
<EOS>
"
Frank
,
"
say
he
 
<EOS>
"
Frank
,
what
on
earth
be
all
this
?
"
<EOS>
and
as
he
speak
he
stretch
out
both
hand
,
the
right
to
his
son
and
the
left
to
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
give
a
blackguard
a
licking
,
that
be
all
,
"
say
Harry
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
feel
that
his
hand
be
hold
with
a
peculiarly
warm
grasp
;
and
he
could
not
but
think
that
his
father
's
face
,
raise
though
his
eyebrow
be
 
though
there
be
on
it
an
intended
expression
of
amazement
and
,
perhaps
,
regret
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
he
could
not
but
think
that
his
father
's
face
look
kindly
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
my
soul
,
my
dear
boy
!
<EOS>
what
have
you
do
to
the
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
not
a
ha'porth
<EOS>
the
bad
,
sir
,
"
say
Frank
,
still
hold
his
father
's
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
be
not
he
!
"
<EOS>
say
Harry
,
shrug
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
He
must
be
make
of
some
very
tough
article
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
my
dear
boy
,
I
hope
there
be
no
danger
.
<EOS>
I
hope
there
be
no
danger
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Danger
!
"
say
Frank
,
who
could
not
yet
induce
himself
to
believe
that
he
have
be
allow
a
fair
chance
with
Mr
Moffat
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Frank
!
<EOS>
Frank
!
<EOS>
how
could
you
be
so
rash
?
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
Pall
Mall
,
too
.
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
all
the
woman
down
at
Greshamsbury
will
have
it
that
you
have
kill
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
almost
wish
I
have
,
"
say
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Frank
!
<EOS>
Frank
!
<EOS>
but
now
tell
me
 
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
the
father
sit
well
pleased
while
he
hear
,
chiefly
from
Harry
Baker
,
the
full
story
of
his
son
's
prowess
.
<EOS>
and
then
they
do
not
separate
without
another
slight
repast
and
another
bottle
of
claret
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Moffat
retire
to
the
country
for
a
while
,
and
then
go
abroad
;
have
doubtless
learn
that
the
petition
be
not
likely
to
give
him
a
seat
for
the
city
of
Barchester
.
<EOS>
and
this
be
the
end
of
the
wooing
with
Miss
Gresham
.
   
<EOS>
Sir
Roger
be
unseat
 
after
this
,
little
occur
at
Greshamsbury
,
or
among
Greshamsbury
people
,
which
it
will
be
necessary
for
us
to
record
.
<EOS>
some
notice
be
,
of
course
,
take
of
Frank
's
prolong
absence
from
his
college
;
and
tiding
,
perhaps
exaggerated
tiding
,
of
what
have
happen
in
Pall
Mall
be
not
slow
to
reach
the
High
Street
of
Cambridge
.
<EOS>
but
that
affair
be
gradually
hush
up
;
and
Frank
go
on
with
his
study
.
  
<EOS>
He
go
back
to
his
study
:
it
then
be
an
understand
arrangement
between
him
and
his
father
that
he
should
not
return
to
Greshamsbury
till
the
summer
vacation
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
,
the
squire
and
Lady
Arabella
have
,
strange
to
say
,
be
of
the
same
mind
.
<EOS>
They
both
wish
to
keep
their
son
away
from
Miss
Thorne
;
and
both
calculated
,
that
at
his
age
and
with
his
disposition
,
it
be
not
probable
that
any
passion
would
last
out
a
six
month
"
absence
.
"
<EOS>
and
when
the
summer
come
it
will
be
an
excellent
opportunity
for
us
to
go
abroad
,
"
say
Lady
Arabella
.
<EOS>
"
Poor
Augusta
will
require
some
change
to
renovate
her
spirit
.
"
  
<EOS>
to
this
last
proposition
the
squire
do
not
assent
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
however
,
allow
to
pass
over
;
and
this
much
be
fix
,
that
Frank
be
not
to
return
home
till
midsummer
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
be
remember
that
Sir
Roger
Scatcherd
have
be
elect
as
sit
member
for
the
city
of
Barchester
;
but
it
will
also
be
remember
that
a
petition
against
his
return
be
threaten
.
<EOS>
have
that
petition
depend
solely
on
Mr
Moffat
,
Sir
Roger
's
seat
no
doubt
would
have
be
save
by
Frank
Gresham
's
cut
whip
.
<EOS>
but
such
be
not
the
case
.
<EOS>
Mr
Moffat
have
be
put
forward
by
the
de
Courcy
interest
;
and
that
noble
family
with
its
dependant
be
not
to
go
to
the
wall
because
Mr
Moffat
have
have
a
thrashing
.
<EOS>
no
;
the
petition
be
to
go
on
;
and
Mr
Nearthewinde
declare
,
that
no
petition
in
his
hand
have
half
so
good
a
chance
of
success
.
"
<EOS>
chance
,
no
,
but
certainty
,
"
say
Mr
Nearthewinde
;
for
Mr
Nearthewinde
have
learn
something
with
reference
to
that
honest
publican
and
the
payment
of
his
little
bill
.
  
<EOS>
the
petition
be
present
and
duly
back
;
the
recognisance
be
sign
,
and
all
the
proper
formality
formally
execute
;
and
Sir
Roger
find
that
his
seat
be
in
jeopardy
.
<EOS>
His
return
have
be
a
great
triumph
to
him
;
and
,
unfortunately
,
he
have
celebrate
that
triumph
as
he
have
be
in
the
habit
of
celebrate
most
of
the
very
triumphant
occasion
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
though
he
be
than
hardly
yet
recover
from
the
effect
of
his
last
attack
,
he
indulge
in
another
violent
drinking
bout
;
and
,
strange
to
say
,
do
so
without
any
immediate
visible
bad
effect
.
  
<EOS>
in
February
he
take
his
seat
amidst
the
warm
congratulation
of
all
man
of
his
own
class
,
and
early
in
the
month
of
April
his
case
come
on
for
trial
.
<EOS>
every
kind
of
electioneer
sin
know
to
the
electioneer
world
be
bring
to
his
charge
;
he
be
accuse
of
falseness
,
dishonesty
,
and
bribery
of
every
sort
:
he

fictitious

<EOS>
there
be
no
description
of
wickedness
appertain
to
the
task
of
procure
vote
of
which
Sir
Roger
have
not
be
guilty
,
either
by
himself
or
by
his
agent
.
<EOS>
He
be
quite
horror
-
strike
at
the
list
of
his
own
enormity
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
somewhat
comfort
when
Mr
Closerstil
tell
him
that
the
meaning
of
it
all
be
that
Mr
Romer
,
the
barrister
,
have
pay
a
former
bill
due
to
Mr
Reddypalm
,
the
publican
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
he
be
indiscreet
,
Sir
Roger
;
I
really
fear
he
be
.
<EOS>
those
young
man
always
be
.
<EOS>
be
energetic
,
they
work
like
horse
;
but
what
be
the
use
of
energy
without
discretion
,
Sir
Roger
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Mr
Closerstil
,
I
know
nothing
about
it
from
first
to
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
agency
can
be
prove
,
Sir
Roger
,
"
say
Mr
Closerstil
,
shake
his
head
.
<EOS>
and
then
there
be
nothing
further
to
be
say
on
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
in
these
day
of
snow
-
white
purity
all
political
delinquency
be
abominable
in
the
eye
of
british
politician
;
but
no
delinquency
be
so
abominable
as
that
of
venality
at
election
.
<EOS>
the
sin
of
bribery
be
damnable
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
one
sin
for
which
,
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
there
can
be
no
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
when
discover
,
it
should
render
the
culprit
liable
to
political
death
,
without
hope
of
pardon
.
<EOS>
It
be
treason
against
a
high
throne
than
that
on
which
the
Queen
sit
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
heresy
which
require
an
_
auto
-
da
-
fé
_
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pollution
to
the
whole
House
,
which
can
only
be
cleanse
by
a
great
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
Anathema
maranatha
!
<EOS>
out
with
it
from
amongst
us
,
even
though
the
half
of
our
heart
's
blood
be
pour
forth
in
the
conflict
!
<EOS>
out
with
it
,
and
for
ever
!
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
language
of
patriotic
member
with
regard
to
bribery
;
and
doubtless
,
if
sincere
,
they
be
in
the
right
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
bad
thing
,
certainly
,
that
a
rich
man
should
buy
vote
;
bad
also
that
a
poor
man
should
sell
them
.
<EOS>
by
all
mean
let
us
repudiate
such
a
system
with
heartfelt
disgust
.
  
<EOS>
with
heartfelt
disgust
,
if
we
can
do
so
,
by
all
mean
;
but
not
with
disgust
pretend
only
and
not
feel
in
the
heart
at
all
.
<EOS>
the
law
against
bribery
at
election
be
now
so
stringent
that
an
unfortunate
candidate
may
easily
become
guilty
,
even
though
actuate
by
the
pure
intention
.
<EOS>
but
not
the
less
on
that
account
do
any
gentleman
,
ambitious
of
the
honour
of
serve
his
country
in
Parliament
,
think
it
necessary
as
a
preliminary
measure
to
provide
a
round
sum
of
money
at
his
banker
's
.
<EOS>
a
candidate
must
pay
for
no
treating
,
no
refreshment
,
no
band
of
music
;
he
must
give
neither
ribbon
to
the
girl
nor
ale
to
the
man
.
<EOS>
if
a
huzza
be
utter
in
his
favour
,
it
be
at
his
peril
;
it
may
be
necessary
for
him
to
prove
before
a
committee
that
it
be
the
spontaneous
result
of
british
feeling
in
his
favour
,
and
not
the
purchase
result
of
british
beer
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
safely
ask
any
one
to
share
his
hotel
dinner
.
<EOS>
bribery
hide
itself
now
in
the
most
impalpable
shape
,
and
may
be
effect
by
the
offer
of
a
glass
of
sherry
.
<EOS>
but
not
the
less
on
this
account
do
a
poor
man
find
that
he
be
quite
unable
to
overcome
the
difficulty
of
a
contest
election
.
  
<EOS>
We
strain
at
our
gnat
with
a
vengeance
,
but
we
swallow
our
camel
with
ease
.
<EOS>
for
what
purpose
be
it
that
we
employ
those
peculiarly
safe
man
of
business
 
Messrs
Nearthewinde
and
Closerstil
 
when
we
wish
to
win
our
path
through
all
obstacle
into
that
sacred
recess
,
if
all
be
so
open
,
all
so
easy
,
all
so
much
above
board
?
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
the
money
be
still
necessary
,
be
still
prepared
,
or
at
any
rate
expend
.
<EOS>
the
poor
candidate
of
course
know
nothing
of
the
matter
till
the
attorney
's
bill
be
lay
before
him
,
when
all
danger
of
petition
have
pass
away
.
<EOS>
He
little
dream
till
then
,
not
he
,
that
there
have
be
banqueting
and
junketing
,
secret
doing
and
deep
drinking
at
his
expense
.
<EOS>
poor
candidate
!
<EOS>
poor
member
!
<EOS>
who
be
so
ignorant
as
he
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
tis
true
he
have
pay
such
bill
before
;
but
"
tis
equally
true
that
he
specially
beg
his
managing
friend
,
Mr
Nearthewinde
,
to
be
very
careful
that
all
be
do
accord
to
law
!
<EOS>
He
pay
the
bill
,
however
,
and
on
the
next
election
will
again
employ
Mr
Nearthewinde
.
  
<EOS>
now
and
again
,
at
rare
interval
,
some
glimpse
into
the
inner
sanctuary
do
reach
the
eye
of
ordinary
mortal
man
without
;
some
slight
accidental
peep
into
those
mystery
from
whence
all
corruption
have
be
so
thoroughly
expel
;
and
then
,
how
delightfully
refreshing
be
the
sight
,
when
,
perhaps
,
some
ex
-
member
,
hurl
from
his
paradise
like
a
fall
peri
,
reveal
the
secret
of
that
pure
heaven
,
and
,
in
the
agony
of
his
despair
,
tell
us
all
that
it
cost
him
to
sit
for
 
---
through
those
few
halcyon
year
!
  
<EOS>
but
Mr
Nearthewinde
be
a
safe
man
,
and
easy
to
be
employ
with
but
little
danger
.
<EOS>
all
these
stringent
bribery
law
only
enhance
the
value
of
such
very
safe
man
as
Mr
Nearthewinde
.
<EOS>
to
him
,
stringent
law
against
bribery
be
the
strong
assurance
of
valuable
employment
.
<EOS>
be
these
law
of
a
nature
to
be
evade
with
ease
,
any
indifferent
attorney
may
manage
a
candidate
's
affair
and
enable
him
to
take
his
seat
with
security
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
well
for
Sir
Roger
if
he
have
trust
solely
to
Mr
Closerstil
;
well
also
for
Mr
Romer
have
he
never
fish
in
those
troubled
water
.
<EOS>
in
due
process
of
time
the
hearing
of
the
petition
come
on
,
and
then
who
so
happy
,
sit
at
his
ease
at
his
London
Inn
,
blow
his
cloud
from
a
long
pipe
,
with
measureless
content
,
as
Mr
Reddypalm
?
<EOS>
Mr
Reddypalm
be
the
one
great
man
of
the
contest
.
<EOS>
all
depend
on
Mr
Reddypalm
;
and
well
he
do
his
duty
.
  
<EOS>
the
result
of
the
petition
be
declare
by
the
committee
to
be
as
follow
:
 
that
Sir
Roger
's
election
be
null
and
void
 
that
the
election
altogether
be
null
and
void
 
that
Sir
Roger
have
,
by
his
agent
,
be
guilty
of
bribery
in
obtain
a
vote
,
by
the
payment
of
a
bill
allege
to
have
be
previously
refuse
payment
 
that
Sir
Roger
himself
know
nothing
about
it
;
 
this
be
always
a
matter
of
course
;
 
but
that
Sir
Roger
's
agent
,
Mr
Romer
,
have
be
wittingly
guilty
of
bribery
with
reference
to
the
transaction
above
describe
.
<EOS>
poor
Sir
Roger
!
<EOS>
Poor
Mr
Romer
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mr
Romer
indeed
!
<EOS>
His
fate
be
perhaps
as
sad
as
well
may
be
,
and
as
foul
a
blot
to
the
purism
of
these
very
pure
time
in
which
we
live
.
<EOS>
not
long
after
those
day
,
it
so
happen
that
some
considerable
amount
of
youthful
energy
and
quidnunc
ability
be
require
to
set
litigation
afloat
at
Hong
-
Kong
,
Mr
Romer
be
send
thither
as
the
fit
man
for
such
work
,
with
rich
assurance
of
future
guerdon
.
<EOS>
who
so
happy
then
as
Mr
Romer
!
<EOS>
but
even
among
the
pure
there
be
room
for
envy
and
detraction
.
<EOS>
Mr
Romer
have
not
yet
cease
to
wonder
at
new
world
,
as
he
skim
among
the
island
of
that
southern
ocean
,
before
the
edict
have
go
forth
for
his
return
.
<EOS>
there
be
man
sit
in
that
huge
court
of
Parliament
on
whose
breast
it
lie
as
an
intolerable
burden
,
that
England
should
be
represent
among
the
antipode
by
one
who
have
tamper
with
the
purity
of
the
franchise
.
<EOS>
for
them
there
be
no
rest
till
this
great
disgrace
should
be
wipe
out
and
atone
for
.
<EOS>
man
<EOS>
they
be
of
that
calibre
,
that
the
slight
reflection
on
them
of
such
a
stigma
seem
to
themselves
to
blacken
their
own
character
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
break
bread
with
satisfaction
till
Mr
Romer
be
recall
.
<EOS>
He
be
recall
,
and
of
course
ruin
 
and
the
mind
of
those
just
man
be
then
at
peace
.
  
<EOS>
to
any
honourable
gentleman
who
really
feel
his
brow
suffuse
with
a
patriotic
blush
,
as
he
think
of
his
country
dishonour
by
Mr
Romer
's
presence
at
Hong
-
Kong
 
to
any
such
gentleman
,
if
any
such
there
be
,
let
all
honour
be
give
,
even
though
the
intensity
of
his
purity
may
create
amazement
to
our
less
finely
organise
soul
.
<EOS>
but
if
no
such
blush
suffuse
the
brow
of
any
honourable
gentleman
;
if
Mr
Romer
be
recall
from
quite
other
feeling
 
<EOS>
what
then
in
lieu
of
honour
shall
we
allot
to
those
honourable
gentleman
who
be
most
concerned
?
  
<EOS>
Sir
Roger
,
however
,
lose
his
seat
,
and
,
after
three
month
of
the
joy
of
legislation
,
find
himself
reduce
by
a
terrible
blow
to
the
low
level
of
private
life
.
  
<EOS>
and
the
blow
to
him
be
very
heavy
.
<EOS>
man
but
seldom
tell
the
truth
of
what
be
in
them
,
even
to
their
dear
friend
;
they
be
ashamed
of
have
feeling
,
or
rather
of
show
that
they
be
trouble
by
any
intensity
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
practice
of
the
time
to
treat
all
pursuit
as
though
they
be
only
half
important
to
us
,
as
though
in
what
we
desire
we
be
only
half
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
to
be
visibly
eager
seem
childish
,
and
be
always
bad
policy
;
and
man
,
therefore
,
nowadays
,
though
they
strive
as
hard
as
ever
in
the
service
of
ambition
 
harder
than
ever
in
that
of
mammon
 
usually
do
so
with
a
pleasant
smile
on
,
as
though
after
all
they
be
but
amuse
themselves
with
the
little
matter
in
hand
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
it
have
be
so
with
Sir
Roger
in
those
electioneer
day
when
he
be
look
for
vote
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
he
have
speak
of
his
seat
in
Parliament
as
but
a
doubtful
good
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
willing
,
indeed
,
to
stand
,
have
be
ask
;
but
the
thing
would
interfere
wonderfully
with
his
business
;
and
then
,
what
do
he
know
about
Parliament
?
<EOS>
nothing
on
earth
:
it
be
the
maddest
scheme
,
but
nevertheless
,
he
be
not
go
to
hang
back
when
call
upon
 
<EOS>
he
have
always
be
rough
and
ready
when
want
,
 
and
there
he
be
now
ready
as
ever
,
and
rough
enough
too
,
God
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Twas
thus
that
he
have
speak
of
his
come
parliamentary
honour
;
and
man
have
generally
take
him
at
his
word
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
return
,
and
this
success
have
be
hail
as
a
great
thing
for
the
cause
and
class
to
which
he
belong
.
<EOS>
but
man
do
not
know
that
his
inner
heart
be
swell
with
triumph
,
and
that
his
bosom
could
hardly
contain
his
pride
as
he
reflect
that
the
poor
Barchester
stone
-
mason
be
now
the
representative
in
Parliament
of
his
native
city
.
<EOS>
and
so
,
when
his
seat
be
attack
,
he
still
laugh
and
joke
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
welcome
to
it
for
him
,
"
he
say
;
"
he
could
keep
it
or
want
it
;
and
of
the
two
,
perhaps
,
the
want
of
it
would
come
most
convenient
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
exactly
think
that
he
have
bribe
any
one
;
but
if
the
bigwig
choose
to
say
so
,
it
be
all
one
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
rough
and
ready
,
now
as
ever
,
"
&
c.
,
&
c.
  
<EOS>
but
when
the
struggle
come
,
it
be
to
him
a
fearful
one
;
not
the
less
fearful
because
there
be
no
one
,
no
,
not
one
friend
in
all
the
world
,
to
whom
he
could
open
his
mind
and
speak
out
honestly
what
be
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
to
Dr
Thorne
he
may
perhaps
have
do
<EOS>
so
have
his
intercourse
with
the
doctor
be
sufficiently
frequent
;
but
it
be
only
now
and
again
when
he
be
ill
,
or
when
the
squire
want
to
borrow
money
,
that
he
see
Dr
Thorne
.
<EOS>
He
have
plenty
of
friend
,
heap
of
friend
in
the
parliamentary
sense
;
friend
who
talk
about
him
,
and
laud
him
at
public
meeting
;
who
shake
hand
with
him
on
platform
,
and
drink
his
health
at
dinner
;
but
he
have
no
friend
who
could
sit
with
him
over
his
own
hearth
,
in
true
friendship
,
and
listen
to
,
and
sympathise
with
,
and
moderate
the
sighing
of
the
inner
man
.
<EOS>
for
him
there
be
no
sympathy
;
no
tenderness
of
love
;
no
retreat
,
save
into
himself
,
from
the
loud
brass
band
of
the
outer
world
.
  
<EOS>
the
blow
hit
him
terribly
hard
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
come
altogether
unexpectedly
,
and
yet
,
when
it
do
come
,
it
be
all
but
unendurable
.
<EOS>
He
have
make
so
much
of
the
power
of
walk
into
that
august
chamber
,
and
sit
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
legislative
equality
with
the
son
of
duke
and
the
curled
darling
of
the
nation
.
<EOS>
money
have
give
him
nothing
,
nothing
but
the
mere
feeling
of
brute
power
:
with
his
three
hundred
thousand
pound
he
have
feel
himself
to
be
no
more
palpably
near
to
the
goal
of
his
ambition
than
when
he
have
chip
stone
for
three
shilling
and
sixpence
a
day
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
be
lead
up
and
introduce
at
that
table
,
when
he
shake
the
old
premier
's
hand
on
the
floor
of
the
House
of
Commons

when
he
hear
the
honourable
member
for
Barchester
allude

authority
on
railway
matter
,
then
,
indeed
,
he
feel
that
he

achieve
something
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
this
cup
be
ravish
from
his
lip
,
almost
before
it
be
taste
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
first
tell
as
a
certainty
that
the
decision
of
the
committee
be
against
him
,
he
bear
up
against
the
misfortune
like
a
man
.
<EOS>
He
laugh
heartily
,
and
declare
himself
well
rid
of
a
very
profitless
profession
;
cut
some
little
joke
about
Mr
Moffat
and
his
thrashing
,
and
leave
on
those
around
him
an
impression
that
he
be
a
man
so
constituted
,
so
strong
in
his
own
resolve
,
so
steadily
pursuant
of
his
own
work
,
that
no
little
contention
of
this
kind
could
affect
him
.
<EOS>
man
admire
his
easy
laughter
,
as
,
shuffle
his
half
-
crown
with
both
his
hand
in
his
trouser
-
pocket
,
he
declare
that
Messrs
Romer
and
Reddypalm
be
the
good
friend
he
have
know
for
this
many
a
day
.
  
<EOS>
but
not
the
less
<EOS>
do
he
walk
out
from
the
room
in
which
he
be
stand
a
break
-
hearted
man
.
<EOS>
Hope
could
not
buoy
him
up
as
she
may
do
other
ex
-
member
in
similarly
disagreeable
circumstance
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
afford
to
look
forward
to
what
further
favour
parliamentary
future
may
have
in
store
for
him
after
a
lapse
of
five
or
six
year
.
<EOS>
five
or
six
year
!
<EOS>
why
,
his
life
be
not
worth
four
year
'
purchase
;
of
that
he
be
perfectly
aware
:
he
could
not
now
live
without
the
stimulus
of
brandy
;
and
yet
,
while
he
take
it
,
he
know
he
be
kill
himself
.
<EOS>
death
he
do
not
fear
;
but
he
would
fain
have
wish
,
after
his
life
of
labour
,
to
have
live
,
while
yet
he
could
live
,
in
the
blaze
of
that
high
world
to
which
for
a
moment
he
have
attain
.
  
<EOS>
He
laugh
loud
and
cheerily
as
he
leave
his
parliamentary
friend
,
and
,
put
himself
into
the
train
,
go
down
to
Boxall
Hill
.
<EOS>
He
laugh
loud
and
cheerily
;
but
he
never
laugh
again
.
<EOS>
It
have
not
be
his
habit
to
laugh
much
at
Boxall
Hill
.
<EOS>
It
be
there
he
keep
his
wife
,
and
Mr
Winterbones
,
and
the
brandy
bottle
behind
his
pillow
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
often
there
find
it
necessary
to
assume
that
loud
and
cheery
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
he
be
apparently
well
in
health
when
he
get
home
;
but
both
Lady
Scatcherd
and
Mr
Winterbones
find
him
more
than
ordinarily
cross
.
<EOS>
He
make
an
affectation
at
sit
very
hard
to
business
,
and
even
talk
of
go
abroad
to
look
at
some
of
his
foreign
contract
.
<EOS>
but
even
Winterbones
find
that
his
patron
do
not
work
as
he
have
be
will
not
to
do
;
and
at
last
,
with
some
misgiving
,
he
tell
Lady
Scatcherd
that
he
fear
that
everything
be
not
right
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
always
at
it
,
my
lady
,
always
,
"
say
Mr
Winterbones
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
he
?
"
say
Lady
Scatcherd
,
well
understand
what
Mr
Winterbones
's
allusion
mean
.
  
<EOS>
"
always
,
my
lady
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
nothing
like
it
.
<EOS>
now
,
there
be
me
 
<EOS>
I
can
always
go
my
half
-
hour
when
I
have
have
my
drop
;
but
he
,
why
,
he
do
not
go
ten
minute
,
not
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
not
cheerful
to
Lady
Scatcherd
;
but
what
be
the
poor
woman
to
do
?
<EOS>
when
she
speak
to
him
on
any
subject
he
only
snarl
at
her
;
and
now
that
the
heavy
fit
be
on
him
,
she
do
not
dare
even
to
mention
the
subject
of
his
drinking
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
know
him
so
savage
in
his
humour
as
he
be
now
,
so
bearish
in
his
habit
,
so
little
inclined
to
humanity
,
so
determined
to
rush
headlong
down
,
with
his
head
between
his
leg
,
into
the
bottomless
abyss
.
  
<EOS>
She
think
of
send
for
Dr
Thorne
;
but
she
do
not
know
under
what
guise
to
send
for
him
,
 
whether
as
doctor
or
as
friend
:
under
neither
would
he
now
be
welcome
;
and
she
well
know
that
Sir
Roger
be
not
the
man
to
accept
in
good
part
either
a
doctor
or
a
friend
who
may
be
unwelcome
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
this
husband
of
hers
,
this
man
who
,
with
all
his
fault
,
be
the
good
of
her
friend
,
whom
of
all
she
love
best
 
<EOS>
she
know
that
he
be
kill
himself
,
and
yet
she
could
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
Sir
Roger
be
his
own
master
,
and
if
kill
himself
he
would
,
kill
himself
he
must
.
  
<EOS>
and
kill
himself
he
do
.
<EOS>
not
indeed
by
one
sudden
blow
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
take
one
huge
dose
of
his
consume
poison
and
then
fall
dead
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
It
would
perhaps
have
be
well
for
himself
,
and
well
for
those
around
him
,
have
he
do
so
.
<EOS>
no
;
the
doctor
have
time
to
congregate
around
his
bed
;
Lady
Scatcherd
be
allow
a
period
of
nurse
-
tend
;
the
sick
man
be
able
to
say
his
last
few
word
and
bid
adieu
to
his
portion
of
the
low
world
with
die
decency
.
<EOS>
as
these
last
word
will
have
some
lasting
effect
upon
the
survive
personage
of
our
story
,
the
reader
must
be
content
to
stand
for
a
short
while
by
the
side
of
Sir
Roger
's
sick
-
bed
,
and
help
us
to
bid
him
God
-
speed
on
the
journey
which
lie
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
retrospective
 
<EOS>
It
be
declare
in
the
early
page
of
this
work
that
Dr
Thorne
be
to
be
our
hero
;
but
it
would
appear
very
much
as
though
he
have
latterly
be
forget
.
<EOS>
since
that
evening
when
he
retire
to
rest
without
let
Mary
share
the
grievous
weight
which
be
on
his
mind
,
we
have
neither
see
nor
hear
aught
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
then
full
midsummer
,
and
it
be
now
early
spring
:
and
during
the
intervene
month
the
doctor
have
not
have
a
happy
time
of
it
.
<EOS>
on
that
night
,
as
we
have
before
tell
,
he
take
his
niece
to
his
heart
;
but
he
could
not
then
bring
himself
to
tell
her
that
which
it
be
so
imperative
that
she
should
know
.
<EOS>
like
a
coward
,
he
would
put
off
the
evil
hour
till
the
next
morning
,
and
thus
rob
himself
of
his
night
's
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
the
morning
come
the
duty
could
not
be
postpone
.
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
have
give
him
to
understand
that
his
niece
would
no
longer
be
a
guest
at
Greshamsbury
;
and
it
be
quite
out
of
the
question
that
Mary
,
after
this
,
should
be
allow
to
put
her
foot
within
the
gate
of
the
domain
without
have
learn
what
Lady
Arabella
have
say
.
<EOS>
so
he
tell
it
her
before
breakfast
,
walk
round
their
little
garden
,
she
with
her
hand
in
his
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
perfectly
thunderstruck
by
the
collect
 
nay
,
cool
way
in
which
she
receive
his
tiding
.
<EOS>
She
turn
pale
,
indeed
;
he
feel
also
that
her
hand
somewhat
tremble
in
his
own
,
and
he
perceive
that
for
a
moment
her
voice
shake
;
but
no
angry
word
escape
her
lip
,
nor
do
she
even
deign
to
repudiate
the
charge
,
which
be
,
as
it
be
,
convey
in
Lady
Arabella
's
request
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
know
,
or
think
he
know
 
nay
,
he
do
know
 
that
Mary
be
wholly
blameless
in
the
matter
:
that
she
have
at
least
give
no
encouragement
to
any
love
on
the
part
of
the
young
heir
;
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
have
expect
that
she
would
avouch
her
own
innocence
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
she
by
no
means
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Arabella
be
quite
right
,
"
she
say
,
"
quite
right
;
if
she
have
any
fear
of
that
kind
,
she
can
not
be
too
careful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
a
selfish
,
proud
woman
,
"
say
the
doctor
;
"
quite
indifferent
to
the
feeling
of
other
;
quite
careless
how
deeply
she
may
hurt
her
neighbour
,
if
,
in
do
so
,
she
may
possibly
benefit
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
not
hurt
me
,
uncle
,
nor
yet
you
.
<EOS>
I
can
live
without
go
to
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
not
to
be
endure
that
she
should
dare
to
cast
an
imputation
on
my
darling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
on
me
,
uncle
?
<EOS>
She
cast
no
imputation
on
me
.
<EOS>
Frank
have
be
foolish
:
I
have
say
nothing
of
it
,
for
it
be
not
worth
while
to
trouble
you
.
<EOS>
but
as
Lady
Arabella
choose
to
interfere
,
I
have
no
right
to
blame
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
say
what
he
should
not
have
say
;
he
have
be
foolish
.
<EOS>
Uncle
,
you
know
I
could
not
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
her
send
him
away
then
,
not
you
;
let
her
banish
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Uncle
,
he
be
her
son
.
<EOS>
a
mother
can
hardly
send
her
son
away
so
easily
:
could
you
send
me
away
,
uncle
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
merely
answer
her
by
twine
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
press
her
to
his
side
.
<EOS>
He
be
well
sure
that
she
be
badly
treat
;
and
yet
now
that
she
so
unaccountably
take
Lady
Arabella
's
part
,
he
hardly
know
how
to
make
this
out
plainly
to
be
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
"
besides
,
uncle
,
Greshamsbury
be
in
a
manner
his
own
;
how
can
he
be
banish
from
his
father
's
house
?
<EOS>
no
,
uncle
<EOS>
;
there
be
an
end
of
my
visit
there
.
<EOS>
They
shall
find
that
I
will
not
thrust
myself
in
their
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
Mary
,
with
a
calm
brow
and
steady
gait
,
go
in
and
make
the
tea
.
  
<EOS>
and
what
may
be
the
feeling
of
her
heart
when
she
so
sententiously
tell
her
uncle
that
Frank
have
be
foolish
?
<EOS>
She
be
of
the
same
age
with
him
;
as
impressionable
,
though
more
powerful
in
hide
such
impression
,
 
as
all
woman
should
be
;
her
heart
be
as
warm
,
her
blood
as
full
of
life
,
her
innate
desire
for
the
companionship
of
some
much
-
loved
object
as
strong
as
his
.
<EOS>
Frank
have
be
foolish
in
avow
his
passion
.
<EOS>
no
such
folly
as
that
could
be
lay
at
her
door
.
<EOS>
but
have
she
be
proof
against
the
other
folly
?
<EOS>
have
she
be
able
to
walk
heart
-
whole
by
his
side
,
while
he
chat
his
commonplace
about
love
?
<EOS>
yes
,
they
be
commonplace
when
we
read
of
them
in
novel
;
common
enough
,
too
,
to
some
of
us
when
we
write
them
;
but
they
be
by
no
means
commonplace
when
first
hear
by
a
young
girl
in
the
rich
,
balmy
fragrance
of
a
July
evening
stroll
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
they
commonplace
when
so
uttered
for
the
first
or
second
time
at
least
,
or
perhaps
the
third
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tis
a
pity
that
so
heavenly
a
pleasure
should
pall
upon
the
sense
.
  
<EOS>
if
it
be
so
that
Frank
's
folly
have
be
listen
to
with
a
certain
amount
of
pleasure
,
Mary
do
not
even
admit
so
much
to
herself
.
<EOS>
but
why
should
it
have
be
otherwise
?
<EOS>
why
should
she
have
be
less
prone
to
love
than
he
be
?
<EOS>
have
he
not
everything
which
girl
do
love
?
<EOS>
which
girl
should
love
?
<EOS>
which
God
create
noble
,
beautiful
,
all
but
godlike
,
in
order
that
woman
,
all
but
goddesslike
,
may
love
?
<EOS>
to
love
thoroughly
,
truly
,
heartily
,
with
her
whole
body
,
soul
,
heart
,
and
strength
;
should
not
that
be
count
for
a
merit
in
a
woman
?
<EOS>
and
yet
we
be
will
not
to
make
a
disgrace
of
it
.
<EOS>
We
do
so
most
unnaturally
,
most
unreasonably
;
for
we
expect
our
daughter
to
get
themselves
marry
off
our
hand
.
<EOS>
when
the
period
of
that
step
come
,
then
love
be
proper
enough
;
but
up
to
that
 
before
that
 
as
regard
all
those
preliminary
passage
which
must
,
we
suppose
,
be
necessary
 
in
all
those
it
become
a
young
lady
to
be
icy

hearte
as
a

and
I
will
come

<EOS>
this
be
the
kind
of
love
which
a
girl
should
feel
before
she
put
her
hand
proudly
in
that
of
her
lover
,
and
consent
that
they
two
shall
be
make
one
flesh
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
feel
no
such
love
as
this
.
<EOS>
She
,
too
,
have
some
inner
perception
of
that
dread
destiny
by
which
it
behove
Frank
Gresham
to
be
forewarn
.
<EOS>
She
,
too
 
though
she
have
never
hear
so
much
say
in
word
 
have
an
almost
instinctive
knowledge
that
his
fate
require
him
to
marry
money
.
<EOS>
think
over
this
in
her
own
way
,
she
be
not
slow
to
convince
herself
that
it
be
out
of
the
question
that
she
should
allow
herself
to
love
Frank
Gresham
.
<EOS>
however
well
her
heart
may
be
incline
to
such
a
feeling
,
it
be
her
duty
to
repress
it
.
<EOS>
She
resolve
,
therefore
,
to
do
so
;
and
she
sometimes
flatter
herself
that
she
have
keep
her
resolution
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
bad
time
for
the
doctor
,
and
bad
time
for
Mary
too
.
<EOS>
She
have
declare
that
she
could
live
without
go
to
Greshamsbury
;
but
she
do
not
find
it
so
easy
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
go
to
Greshamsbury
all
her
life
,
and
it
be
as
customary
with
her
to
be
there
as
at
home
.
<EOS>
such
old
custom
be
not
break
without
pain
.
<EOS>
have
she
leave
the
place
it
would
have
be
far
different
;
but
,
as
it
be
,
she
daily
pass
the
gate
,
daily
see
and
speak
to
some
of
the
servant
,
who
know
her
as
well
as
they
do
the
young
lady
of
the
family
 
be
in
hourly
contact
,
as
it
be
,
with
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
only
that
she
do
not
go
there
,
but
that
everyone
know
that
she
have
suddenly
discontinue
do
so
.
<EOS>
yes
,
she
could
live
without
go
to
Greshamsbury
;
but
for
some
time
she
have
but
a
poor
life
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
feel
,
nay
,
almost
hear
,
that
every
man
and
woman
,
boy
and
girl
,
in
the
village
be
tell
his
and
her
neighbour
that
Mary
Thorne
no
longer
go
to
the
house
because
of
Lady
Arabella
and
the
young
squire
.
  
<EOS>
but
Beatrice
,
of
course
,
come
to
her
.
<EOS>
what
be
she
to
say
to
Beatrice
?
<EOS>
the
truth
!
<EOS>
nay
,
but
it
be
not
always
so
easy
to
say
the
truth
,
even
to
one
's
dear
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
come
up
now
<EOS>
he
have
go
?
"
say
Beatrice
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
"
say
Mary
;
"
that
would
hardly
be
pleasant
to
Lady
Arabella
,
nor
to
me
either
.
<EOS>
no
,
Trichy
,
dear
;
my
visit
to
dear
old
Greshamsbury
be
do
,
do
,
do
:
perhaps
in
some
twenty
year
'
time
I
may
be
walk
down
the
lawn
with
your
brother
,
and
discuss
our
childish
day
 
that
is
,
always
,
if
the
then
Mrs
Gresham
shall
have
invite
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
Frank
have
be
so
wrong
,
so
unkind
,
so
cruel
?
"
say
Beatrice
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
a
light
in
which
Miss
Thorne
do
not
take
any
pleasure
in
discuss
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Her
idea
of
Frank
's
fault
,
and
unkindness
,
and
cruelty
,
be
doubtless
different
from
those
of
his
sister
.
<EOS>
such
cruelty
be
not
unnaturally
excuse
in
her
eye
by
many
circumstance
which
Beatrice
do
not
fully
understand
.
<EOS>
Mary
be
quite
ready
to
go
hand
in
hand
with
Lady
Arabella
and
the
rest
of
the
Greshamsbury
<EOS>
fold
in
put
an
end
,
if
possible
,
to
Frank
's
passion
<EOS>
:
she
would
give
no
one
a
right
to
accuse
her
of
assist
to
ruin
the
young
heir
;
but
she
could
hardly
bring
herself
to
admit
that
he
be
so
very
wrong
 
<EOS>
no
,
nor
yet
even
so
very
cruel
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
the
squire
come
to
see
her
,
and
this
be
a
yet
hard
trial
than
the
visit
of
Beatrice
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
difficult
for
her
to
speak
to
him
that
she
could
not
but
wish
him
away
;
and
yet
,
have
he
not
come
,
have
he
altogether
neglect
her
,
she
would
have
feel
it
to
be
unkind
.
<EOS>
She
have
ever
be
his
pet
,
have
always
receive
kindness
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
for
all
this
,
Mary
;
very
sorry
,
"
say
he
,
stand
up
,
and
hold
both
her
hand
in
his
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
help
,
sir
,
"
say
she
,
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
he
;
"
I
do
not
know
 
it
ought
to
be
help
somehow
 
I
be
quite
sure
you
have
not
be
to
blame
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
she
,
very
quietly
,
as
though
the
position
be
one
quite
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
I
have
be
very
much
to
blame
.
<EOS>
there
will
be
misfortune
sometimes
when
nobody
be
to
blame
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
quite
understand
it
all
,
"
say
the
squire
;
"
<EOS>
but
if
Frank
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
we
will
not
talk
about
him
,
"
say
she
,
still
laugh
gently
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
understand
,
Mary
,
how
dear
he
must
be
to
me
;
but
if
 
"
  
"
Mr
Gresham
,
I
would
not
for
world
be
the
cause
of
any
unpleasantness
between
you
and
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
can
not
bear
to
think
that
we
have
banish
you
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
help
.
<EOS>
thing
will
all
come
right
in
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
be
so
lonely
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
I
shall
get
over
all
that
.
<EOS>
here
,
you
know
,
Mr
Gresham
,
"
I
be
monarch
of
all
I
survey
;
"
and
there
be
a
great
deal
in
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
squire
do
not
quite
catch
her
meaning
,
but
a
glimmering
of
it
do
reach
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
competent
to
Lady
Arabella
to
banish
her
from
Greshamsbury
;
it
be
within
the
sphere
of
the
squire
's
duty
to
prohibit
his
son
from
an
imprudent
match
;
it
be
for
the
Greshams
to
guard
their
Greshamsbury
treasure
as
best
they
could
within
their
own
territory
:
but
let
them
beware
that
they
do
not
attack
her
on
her
.
<EOS>
in
obedience
to
the
first
expression
of
their
wish
,
she
have
submit
herself
to
this
public
mark
of
their
disapproval
because
she
have
see
at
once
,
with
her
clear
intellect
,
that
they
be
only
do
that
which
her
conscience
must
approve
.
<EOS>
without
a
murmur
,
therefore
,
she
consent
to
be
point
at
as
the
young
lady
who
have
be
turn
out
of
Greshamsbury
because
of
the
young
squire
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
help
for
it
.
<EOS>
but
let
them
take
care
that
they
do
not
go
beyond
that
.
<EOS>
outside
those
Greshamsbury
gate
she
and
Frank
Gresham
<EOS>
,
she
and
Lady
Arabella
meet
on
equal
term
;
let
them
each
fight
their
own
battle
.
  
<EOS>
the
squire
kiss
her
forehead
affectionately
and
take
his
leave
,
feel
,
somehow
,
that
he
have
be
excuse
and
pity
,
and
make
much
of
;
whereas
he
have
call
on
his
young
neighbour
with
the
intention
of
excusing
,
and
pity
,
and
make
much
of
her
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
quite
comfortable
as
he
leave
the
house
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
be
sufficiently
honest
-
hearted
to
own
to
himself
that
Mary
Thorne
be
a
fine
girl
.
<EOS>
only
that
it
be
so
absolutely
necessary
that
Frank
should
marry
money
 
and
only
,
also
,
that
poor
Mary
be
such
a
birthless
foundle
in
the
world
's
esteem
 
only
,
but
for
these
thing
,
what
a
wife
she
would
have
make
for
that
son
of
his
!
  
<EOS>
to
one
person
only
do
she
talk
freely
on
the
subject
,
and
that
one
be
Patience
Oriel
;
and
even
with
her
the
freedom
be
rather
of
the
mind
than
of
the
heart
.
<EOS>
She
never
say
a
word
of
her
feeling
with
reference
to
Frank
,
but
she
say
much
of
her
position
in
the
village
,
and
of
the
necessity
she
be
under
to
keep
out
of
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
hard
,
"
say
Patience
,
"
that
the
offence
should
be
all
with
him
,
and
the
punishment
all
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
as
for
that
,
"
say
Mary
,
laugh
,
"
I
will
not
confess
to
any
offence
,
nor
yet
to
any
punishment
;
certainly
not
to
any
punishment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
come
to
the
same
thing
in
the
end
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
not
so
,
Patience
;
there
be
always
some
little
sting
of
disgrace
in
punishment
:
now
I
be
not
go
to
hold
myself
in
the
least
disgraced
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Mary
,
you
must
meet
the
Greshams
sometimes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
meet
them
!
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
slight
objection
on
earth
to
meet
all
,
or
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
a
whit
dangerous
to
me
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tis
I
that
be
the
wild
beast
,
and
"
tis
they
that
must
avoid
me
,
"
<EOS>
and
then
she
add
,
after
a
pause
 
slightly
blush
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
slight
objection
even
to
meet
him
if
chance
bring
him
in
my
way
.
<EOS>
let
them
look
to
that
.
<EOS>
My
undertaking
go
no
further
than
this
,
that
I
will
not
be
see
within
their
gate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
the
girl
so
far
understand
each
other
that
Patience
undertake
,
rather
than
promise
,
to
give
Mary
what
assistance
she
could
;
and
,
despite
Mary
's
bravado
,
she
be
in
such
a
position
that
she
much
want
the
assistance
of
such
a
friend
as
Miss
Oriel
.
  
<EOS>
after
an
absence
of
some
six
week
,
Frank
,
as
we
have
see
,
return
home
.
<EOS>
nothing
be
say
to
him
,
except
by
Beatrice
,
as
to
these
new
Greshamsbury
arrangement
;
and
he
,
when
he
find
Mary
be
not
at
the
place
,
go
boldly
to
the
doctor
's
house
to
seek
her
.
<EOS>
but
it
have
be
see
,
also
,
that
she
discreetly
keep
out
of
his
way
.
<EOS>
this
she
have
think
fit
to
do
when
the
time
come
,
although
she
have
be
so
ready
with
her
boast
that
she
have
no
objection
on
earth
to
meet
him
.
  
<EOS>
after
that
there
have
be
the
Christmas
vacation
,
and
Mary
have
again
find
discretion
to
be
the
well
part
of
valour
.
<EOS>
this
be
doubtless
disagreeable
enough
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
particular
wish
to
spend
her
Christmas
with
Miss
Oriel
's
aunt
instead
of
at
her
uncle
's
fireside
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
her
Christmas
festivity
have
hitherto
be
keep
at
Greshamsbury
,
the
doctor
and
herself
have
make
a
part
of
the
family
circle
there
assemble
.
<EOS>
this
be
out
of
the
question
now
;
and
perhaps
the
absolute
change
to
old
Miss
Oriel
's
house
be
well
for
her
than
the
less
change
to
her
uncle
's
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
besides
,
how
could
she
have
demean
herself
when
she
meet
Frank
in
their
parish
church
?
<EOS>
all
this
have
be
fully
understand
by
Patience
,
and
,
therefore
,
have
this
Christmas
visit
be
plan
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
this
affair
of
Frank
and
Mary
Thorne
cease
for
a
while
to
be
talk
of
at
Greshamsbury
,
for
that
other
affair
of
Mr
Moffat
and
Augusta
<EOS>
monopolise
the
rural
attention
.
<EOS>
Augusta
,
as
we
have
say
,
bore
it
well
,
and
sustain
the
public
gaze
without
much
flinching
.
<EOS>
Her
period
of
martyrdom
,
however
,
do
not
last
long
,
for
soon
the
news
arrive
of
Frank
's
exploit
in
Pall
Mall
;
and
then
the
Greshamsburyites
forget
to
think
much
more
of
Augusta
,
be
fully
occupy
in
thinking
of
what
Frank
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
the
tale
,
as
it
be
first
tell
,
declare
that
Frank
have
follow
Mr
Moffat
up
into
his
club
;
have
drag
him
thence
into
the
middle
of
Pall
Mall
,
and
have
then
slaughter
him
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
this
be
by
degree
modify
till
a
sobered
fiction
become
generally
prevalent
,
that
Mr
Moffat
be
lie
somewhere
,
still
alive
,
but
with
all
his
bone
in
a
general
state
of
compound
fracture
.
<EOS>
this
adventure
again
bring
Frank
into
the
ascendant
,
and
restore
to
Mary
her
former
position
as
the
Greshamsbury
heroine
.
  
<EOS>
"
one
can
not
wonder
at
his
be
very
angry
,
"
say
Beatrice
,
discuss
the
matter
with
Mary
 
very
imprudently
.
  
<EOS>
"
wonder
 
<EOS>
no
;
the
wonder
would
have
be
if
he
have
not
be
angry
.
<EOS>
one
may
have
be
quite
sure
that
he
would
have
be
angry
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
be
not
absolutely
right
for
him
to
beat
Mr
Moffat
,
"
say
Beatrice
,
apologetically
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
right
,
Trichy
?
<EOS>
I
think
he
be
very
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
to
beat
him
so
very
much
,
Mary
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
suppose
a
man
can
not
exactly
stand
measure
how
much
he
do
these
thing
.
<EOS>
I
like
your
brother
for
what
he
have
do
,
and
I
say
<EOS>
so
frankly
 
<EOS>
though
I
suppose
I
ought
to
eat
my
tongue
out
before
I
should
say
such
a
thing
,
eh
,
Trichy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
there
be
any
harm
in
that
,
"
say
Beatrice
,
demurely
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
both
like
each
other
there
would
be
no
harm
in
that
 
if
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
not
there
?
"
say
Mary
,
in
a
low
tone
of
banter
satire
;
"
that
be
so
kind
,
Trichy
,
come
from
you
 
from
one
of
the
family
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
well
aware
,
Mary
,
that
if
I
could
have
my
wish
 
"
  
"
yes
:
I
be
well
aware
what
a
paragon
of
goodness
you
be
.
<EOS>
if
you
could
have
your
way
I
should
be
admit
into
heaven
again
;
should
not
I
?
<EOS>
only
with
this
proviso
,
that
if
a
stray
angel
should
ever
whisper
to
me
with
bated
breath
,
mistake
me
,
perchance
,
for
one
of
his
own
class
,
I
should
be
bind
to
close
my
ear
to
his
whispering
,
and
remind
him
humbly
that
I
be
only
a
poor
mortal
.
<EOS>
You
would
trust
me
so
far
,
would
not
you
,
trichy
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
trust
you
in
any
way
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
you
be
unkind
in
say
such
thing
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
into
whatever
heaven
I
be
admit
,
I
will
go
only
on
this
understanding
:
that
I
be
to
be
as
good
an
angel
as
any
of
those
around
me
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
,
Mary
dear
,
why
do
you
say
this
to
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
because
 
because
 
because
 
ah
me
!
<EOS>
why
,
indeed
,
but
because
I
have
no
one
else
to
say
it
to
.
<EOS>
certainly
not
because
you
have
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seem
as
though
you
be
find
fault
with
me
.

so
I

I

fault

sore

Trichy

you
hardly
realise
my

you
hardly

treat

how
I

force

myself

treat
without

You

<EOS>
Beatrice
do
not
quite
see
it
all
;
but
she
see
enough
of
it
to
know
that
Mary
be
to
be
pity
;
so
,
instead
of
scold
her
friend
for
be
cross
,
she
throw
her
arm
round
her
and
kiss
her
affectionately
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
doctor
all
this
time
suffer
much
more
than
his
niece
do
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
complain
out
loudly
;
he
could
not
aver
that
his
pet
lamb
have
be
ill
treat
;
he
could
not
even
have
the
pleasure
of
openly
quarrel
with
Lady
Arabella
;
but
not
the
less
do
he
feel
it
to
be
most
cruel
that
Mary
should
have
to
live
before
the
world
as
an
outcast
,
because
it
have
please
Frank
Gresham
to
fall
in
love
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
but
his
bitterness
be
not
chiefly
against
Frank
.
<EOS>
that
Frank
have
be
very
foolish
he
could
not
but
acknowledge
;
but
it
be
a
kind
of
folly
for
which
the
doctor
be
able
to
find
excuse
.
<EOS>
for
Lady
Arabella
's
cold
propriety
he
could
find
no
excuse
.
  
<EOS>
with
the
squire
he
have
speak
no
word
on
the
subject
up
to
this
period
of
which
we
be
now
write
.
<EOS>
with
her
ladyship
he
have
never
speak
on
it
since
that
day
when
she
have
tell
him
that
Mary
be
to
come
no
more
to
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
He
never
now
dine
or
spend
his
evening
at
Greshamsbury
,
and
seldom
be
to
be
see
at
the
house
,
except
when
call
in
professionally
.
<EOS>
the
squire
,
indeed
,
he
frequently
meet
;
but
he
either
do
so
in
the
village
,
or
out
on
horseback
,
or
at
his
own
house
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
doctor
first
hear
that
Sir
Roger
have
lose
his
seat
,
and
have
return
to
Boxall
Hill
,
he
resolve
to
go
over
and
see
him

<EOS>
but
the
visit
be
postpone
from
day
to
day

as
visit
be
postpone
which
may

a

be
bring

and
away
the

go
on

cold
bleak

to
Boxall
Hill

"
who
will
be
his

<EOS>
as
the
doctor
ride
along
,
he
could
not
quite
rid
his
mind
of
this
question

<EOS>
the
poor
man
now
about
to
die
have
wealth
enough
to
make
many
heir

<EOS>
what
if
his

should

soften
towards
his

<EOS>
what
if

should

find
in

to

possess
of
such
wealth
that
the
Greshams
should

again
be
happy
to
welcome
her
at
Greshamsbury

<EOS>
the
doctor
be
not
a
lover
of
money
 
and
he
do
his
good
to
get
rid
of
such
pernicious
thought
.
<EOS>
but
his
longing
,
perhaps
,
be
not
so
much
that
Mary
should
be
rich
,
as
that
she
should
have
the
power
of
heap
coal

injure

Louis
Scatcherd
 
<EOS>
when
Dr
Thorne
reach
Boxall
Hill
he
find
Mr
Rerechild
from
Barchester
there
before
him
.
<EOS>
Poor
Lady
Scatcherd
,
when
her
husband
be
stricken
by
the
fit
,
hardly
know
in
her
dismay
what
adequate
step
to
take
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
send
for
Dr
Thorne
;
but
she
have
think
that
in
so
grave
a
peril
<EOS>
the
medical
skill
of
no
one
man
could
suffice
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
she
know
,
quite
out
of
the
question
for
her
to
invoke
the
aid
of
Dr
Fillgrave
,
whom
no
earthly
persuasion
would
have
bring
to
Boxall
Hill
;
and
as
Mr
Rerechild
be
suppose
in
the
Barchester
world
to
be
second
 
though
at
a
long
interval
 
to
that
great
man
,
she
have
apply
for
his
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
now
Mr
Rerechild
be
a
follower
and
humble
friend
of
Dr
Fillgrave
;
and
be
will
not
to
regard
anything
that
come
from
the
Barchester
doctor
as
sure
light
from
the
lamp
of
Æsculapius
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
therefore
be
other
than
an
enemy
of
Dr
Thorne
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
a
prudent
,
discreet
man
,
with
a
long
family
,
averse
to
professional
hostility
,
as
know
that
he
could
make
more
by
medical
friend
than
medical
foe
,
and
not
at
all
incline
to
take
up
any
man
's
cudgel
to
his
own
detriment
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
of
course
,
hear
of
that
dreadful
affront
which
have
be
put
upon
his
friend
,
as
have
all
the
"
medical
world
"
 
all
the
medical
world
at
least
of
Barsetshire
;
and
he
have
often
express
his
sympathy
with
Dr
Fillgrave
and
his
abhorrence
of
Dr
Thorne
's
anti
-
professional
practice
.
<EOS>
but
now
that
he
find
himself
about
to
be
bring
in
contact
with
Dr
Thorne
,
he
reflect
that
the
Galen
of
Greshamsbury
be
at
any
rate
equal
in
reputation
to
him
of
Barchester
;
that
the
one
be
probably
on
the
rise
,
whereas
the
other
be
already
consider
by
some
as
rather
antiquated
;
and
he
therefore
wisely
resolve
that
the
present
would
be
an
excellent
opportunity
for
him
to
make
a
friend
of
Dr
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Lady
Scatcherd
have
an
inkling
that
Dr
Fillgrave
and
Mr
Rerechild
be
accustom
to
row
in
the
same
boat
,
and
she
be
not
altogether
free
from
fear
that
there
may
be
an
outbreak
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
take
an
opportunity
before
Dr
Thorne
's
arrival
to
deprecate
any
wrathful
tendency
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Lady
Scatcherd
!
<EOS>
I
have
the
great
respect
for
Dr
Thorne
,
"
say
he
;
"
the
great
possible
respect
;
a
most
skilful
practitioner
 
something
brusque
certainly
,
and
perhaps
a
little
obstinate
.
<EOS>
but
what
then
?
<EOS>
we
all
have
our
fault
,
Lady
Scatcherd
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
 
yes
;
we
all
have
,
Mr
Rerechild
;
that
be
certain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
my
friend
Fillgrave
 
Lady
Scatcherd
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
bear
anything
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
now
I
think
he
be
wrong
;
and
so
I
tell
him
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Rerechild
be
in
error
here
;
for
he
have
never
yet
venture
to
tell
Dr
fillgrave
that
he
be
wrong
in
anything
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
bear
and
forbear
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
be
an
excellent
man
 
in
his
way
very
excellent
,
Lady
Scatcherd
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
little
conversation
take
place
after
Mr
Rerechild
's
first
visit
to
his
patient
:
what
step
be
immediately
take
for
the
relief
of
the
sufferer
we
need
not
describe
.
<EOS>
They
be
doubtless
well
intend
,
and
be
,
perhaps
,
as
well
adapt
to
stave
off
the
come
evil
day
as
any
that
Dr
Fillgrave
,
or
even
the
great
Sir
Omicron
Pie
may
have
use
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
Dr
Thorne
arrive
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
doctor
!
<EOS>
doctor
!
<EOS>
"
exclaim
Lady
Scatcherd
,
almost
hang
round
his
neck
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
we
to
do
?
<EOS>
what
be
we
to
do
?
<EOS>
He
be
very
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
he
speak
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
nothing
like
a
word
:
he
have
make
one
or
two
muttered
sound
;
but
,
poor
soul
,
you
could
make
nothing
of
it
 
<EOS>
oh
,
doctor
!
<EOS>
doctor
!
<EOS>
he
have
never
be
like
this
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
see
where
Lady
Scatcherd
place
any
such
faith
as
she
may
still
have
in
the
healing
art
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Rerechild
be
here
and
have
see
him
,
"
she
continue
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
best
to
send
for
two
,
for
fear
of
accident
.
<EOS>
He
have
do
something
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
.
<EOS>
but
,
doctor
,
do
tell
the
truth
now
<EOS>
;
I
look
to
you
to
tell
me
the
truth
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
then
go
up
and
see
his
patient
;
and
have
he
literally
comply
with
Lady
Scatcherd
's
request
,
he
may
have
tell
her
at
once
that
there
be
no
hope
.
<EOS>
as
,
however
,
he
have
not
the
heart
to
do
this
,
he
mystify
the
case
as
doctor
so
well
know
how
to
do
,
and
tell
her
that
"
there
be
cause
to
fear
,
<EOS>
great
cause
for
fear
<EOS>
;
he
be
sorry
to
say
,
<EOS>
very
great
cause
for
much
fear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
promise
to
stay
the
night
there
,
and
,
if
possible
,
the
following
night
also
;
and
then
Lady
Scatcherd
become
troubled
in
her
mind
as
to
what
she
should
do
with
Mr
Rerechild
.
<EOS>
He
also
declare
,
with
much
medical
humanity
,
that
,
let
the
inconvenience
be
what
it
may
,
he
too
would
stay
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
the
loss
,
"
he
say
,
"
of
such
a
man
as
Sir
Roger
Scatcherd
be
of
such
paramount
importance
as
to
make
other
matter
trivial
.
<EOS>
He
would
certainly
not
allow
the
whole
weight
to
fall
on
the
shoulder
of
his
friend
Dr
Thorne
:
he
also
would
stay
at
any
rate
that
night
by
the
sick
man
's
bedside
.
<EOS>
by
the
follow
morning
some
change
may
be
expect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Dr
Thorne
,
"
say
her
ladyship
,
call
the
doctor
into
the
housekeeping
-
room
,
in
which
she
and
Hannah
spend
any
time
that
they
be
not
require
upstairs
;
"
just
come
in
,
doctor
:
<EOS>
you
could
not
tell
him
we
do
not
want
him
any
more
,
could
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
tell
whom
?
"
say
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
 
Mr
Rerechild
:
might
not
he
go
away
,
do
you
think
?
"
  
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
explain
that
Mr
Rerechild
certainly
may
go
away
if
he
please
;
but
that
it
would
by
no
means
be
proper
for
one
doctor
to
tell
another
to
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
and
so
Mr
Rerechild
be
allow
to
share
the
glory
of
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
the
patient
remain
speechless
;
but
it
soon
become
evident
that
Nature
be
use
all
her
effort
to
make
one
final
rally
.
<EOS>
from
time
to
time
he
moan
and
mutter
as
though
he
be
conscious
,
and
it
seem
as
though
he
strove
to
speak
.
<EOS>
He
gradually
become
awake
,
at
any
rate
to
suffering
,
and
Dr
Thorne
begin
to
think
that
the
last
scene
would
be
postpone
for
yet
a
while
longer
.
  
<EOS>
"
wonderful
strong
constitution
 
eh
,
Dr
Thorne
?
<EOS>
wonderful
!
"
say
Mr
Rerechild
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
he
have
be
a
strong
man

<EOS>
"
  
"
strong
as
a
horse
,
Dr
Thorne

<EOS>
Lord

what
that
man
would
have
be
if
he
have
give
himself
a
chance
!
<EOS>
You
know
his
constitution
of
course

<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
;
pretty
well
.
<EOS>
I
have
attend
him
for
many
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
always
drink
,
I
suppose
;
always
at
it
 
eh
?
"
  
"
He
have
not
be
a
temperate
man
,
certainly
.
"
  
"
the
brain
,
you
see
,
clean
go
 
and
not
a
particle
of
coating
leave
to
the
stomach
;
and
yet
what
a
struggle
he
make
 
an
interesting
case
,
be
not
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
sad
to
see
such
an
intellect
so
destroy
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
very
sad
,
very
sad
indeed

<EOS>
how
Fillgrave
would
have
like
to
have
see
this
case
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
clever
man
,
be
Fillgrave
 
in
his
way
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
he
be
,
"
say
Dr
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
that
he
would
make
anything
of
a
case
like
this
now
 
<EOS>
he
be
not
,
you
know
,
quite
 
quite
 
perhaps
not
quite
up
to
the
new
time
of
day
,
if
one
may
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
have
a
very
extensive
provincial
practice
,
"
say
Dr
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
very
 
very
;
and
make
a
tidy
lot
of
money
too
,
have
Fillgrave
.
<EOS>
He
be
worth
six
thousand
pound
,
I
suppose
;
now
that
be
a
good
deal
of
money
to
put
by
in
a
little
town
like
Barchester
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
indeed
.
"
  
"
what
I
say
to
Fillgrave
be
this
 
keep
your
eye
open
;
one
should
never
be
too
old
to
learn
 
<EOS>
there
be
always
something
new
worth
pick
up
.
<EOS>
but
,
no
 
he
will
not
believe
that
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
believe
that
any
new
idea
can
be
worth
anything
.
<EOS>
You
know
a
man
must
go
to
the
wall
in
that
way
 
eh
,
doctor
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
again
they
be
call
to
their
patient
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
do
finely
,
finely
,
"
say
Mr
Rerechild
to
Lady
Scatcherd
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
fair
ground
to
hope
he
will
rally
;
fair
ground
,
be
there
not
,
doctor
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
he
will
rally
;
but
how
long
that
may
last
,
that
we
can
hardly
say

ten

I
dare

ten

I

very

<EOS>
"
no

nothing

and

Would

Would

may

what

why

<EOS>
We
hear
a
good
deal

jolly
widow

the
slanderous
raillery

tell
much
of
conjugal
disturbance
as
a
cure
for
which
woman
will
look
forward

a
state

widowhood

<EOS>
the
raillery

slanderous

<EOS>
in

to

vice
of
which
neither
we
,
nor
our
neighbour
,
nor
our
friend
,
nor
even
our
enemy
be
ever
guilty
.
<EOS>
It
be
our
favourite
parlance
to
talk
of
the
family
trouble
of
Mrs
Green
on
our
right
,
and
to
tell
how
Mrs
Young
on
our
left
be
strongly
suspect

raise
her
hand
to

lord

<EOS>
what
right

<EOS>
what
have
we
see
in

personal
walk
through

devil

<EOS>
there

Lady

"
You

<EOS>
and
with
such
sorrowful
wailing
she
sit
rock
herself
through
the
long
night
,
every
now
and
then
comfort
herself
by
the
performance
of
some
menial
service
in
the
sick
man

<EOS>
Sir
Roger
pass
the
night
much
as
he
have
pass
the
day
,
except
that
he
appear
gradually
to
be
grow
nearer
to
a
state
of
consciousness
.
<EOS>
on
the
follow
morning
they
succeed
at
last
in
make
Mr
Rerechild
understand
that
they
be
not
desirous
of
keep
him
longer
from
his
Barchester
practice
;
and
at
about
twelve
o'clock
Dr
Thorne
also
go
,
promise
that
he
would
return
in
the
evening
,
and
again
pass
the
night
at
Boxall
Hill
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
Sir
Roger
once
more
awoke
to
his
sense
,
and
when
he
do
<EOS>
so
his
son
be
stand
at
his
bedside
.
<EOS>
Louis
Philippe
Scatcherd
 
<EOS>
or
as
it
may
be
more
convenient
to
call
him
,
Louis
 
be
a
young
man
just
of
the
age
of
Frank
Gresham
.
<EOS>
but
there
could
hardly
be
two
youth
more
different
in
their
appearance
.
<EOS>
Louis
,
though
his
father
and
mother
be
both
robust
person
,
be
short
and
slight
,
and
now
of
a
sickly
frame
.
<EOS>
Frank
be
a
picture
of
health
and
strength
;
but
,
though
manly
in
disposition
,
be
by
no
means
precocious
either
in
appearance
or
manner
.
<EOS>
Louis
Scatcherd
look
as
though
he
be
four
year
the
other
's
senior
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
send
to
Eton
when
he
be
fifteen
,
his
father
be
under
the
impression
that
this
be
the
most
ready
and
best
-
recognise
method
of
make
him
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
here
he
do
not
altogether
fail
as
regard
the
coveted
object
of
his
become
the
companion
of
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
have
more
pocket
-
money
than
any
other
lad
in
the
school
,
and
be
possess
also
of
a
certain
effrontery
which
carry
him
ahead
among
boy
of
his
own
age
.
<EOS>
He
gain
,
therefore
,
a
degree
of
éclat
,
even
among
those
who
know
,
and
very
frequently
say
to
each
other
,
that
young
Scatcherd
be
not
fit
to
be
their
companion
except
on
such
open
occasion
as
those
of
cricket
-
match
and
boat
-
race
.
<EOS>
boy
,
in
this
respect
,
be
at
least
as
exclusive
as
man
,
and
understand
as
well
the
difference
between
an
inner
and
an
outer
circle
.
<EOS>
Scatcherd
have
many
companion
at
school
who
be
glad
enough
to
go
up
to
Maidenhead
with
him
in
his
boat
;
but
there
be
not
one
among
them
who
would
have
talk
to
him
of
his
sister
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Roger
be
vastly
proud
of
his
son
's
success
,
and
do
his
good
to
stimulate
it
by
lavish
expenditure
at
the
Christopher
,
whenever
he
could
manage
to
run
down
to
Eton
.
<EOS>
but
this
practice
,
though
sufficiently
unexceptionable
to
the
boy
,
be
not
hold
in
equal
delight
by
the
master
.
<EOS>
to
tell
the
truth
,
neither
Sir
Roger
nor
his
son
be
favourite
with
these
stern
custodian
.
<EOS>
at
last
it
be
feel
necessary
to
get
rid
of
them
both
;
and
Louis
be
not
long
in
give
them
an
opportunity
,
by
get
tipsy
twice
in
one
week
.
<EOS>
on
the
second
occasion
he
be
send
away
,
and
he
and
Sir
Roger
,
though
long
talk
of
,
be
see
no
more
at
Eton
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
university
be
still
open
to
Louis
Philippe
,
and
before
he
be
eighteen
he
be
enter
as
a
gentleman
-
commoner
at
Trinity
.
<EOS>
as
he
be
,
moreover
,
the
eld
son
of
a
baronet
,
and
have
almost
unlimited
command
of
money
,
here
also
he
be
enable
for
a
while
to
shine
.
  
<EOS>
to
shine
!
<EOS>
but
very
fitfully
;
and
one
may
say
almost
with
a
ghastly
glare
.
<EOS>
the
very
lad
who
have
eat
his
father
's
dinner
at
Eton
,
and
share
his
four
-
oar
at
Eton
,
know
much
better
than
to
associate
with
him
at
Cambridge
now
that
they
have
put
on
the
_
toga
virilis
_
.
<EOS>
They
be
still
as
prone
as
ever
to
fun
,
frolic
,
and
devilry
 
perhaps
more
so
than
ever
,
see
that
more
be
in
their
power
;
but
they
acquire
an
idea
that
it
behove
them
to
be
somewhat
circumspect
as
to
the
man
with
whom
their
prank
be
perpetrate
.
<EOS>
so
,
in
those
day
,
Louis
Scatcherd
be
coldly
look
on
by
his
whilom
Eton
friend
.
  
<EOS>
but
young
Scatcherd
do
not
fail
to
find
companion
at
Cambridge
also
.
<EOS>
there
be
few
place
indeed
in
which
a
rich
man
can
not
buy
companionship
.
<EOS>
but
the
set
with
whom
he
live
at
Cambridge
be
the
bad
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
They
be
fast
,
slang
man
,
who
be
fast
and
slang
,
and
nothing
else
 
man
who
imitate
groom
in
more
than
their
dress
,
and
who
look
on
the
customary
hero
of
race
-
course
as
the
high
lord
of
the
ascendant
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
among
those
at
college
young
Scatcherd
do
shine
as
long
as
such
lustre
be
permit
him
.
<EOS>
here
,
indeed
,
his
father
,
who
have
strive
only
to
encourage
him
at
Eton
,
do
strive
somewhat
to
control
him
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
not
now
easy
.
<EOS>
if
he
limit
his
son
's
allowance
,
he
only
drive
him
to
do
his
debauchery
on
credit
.
<EOS>
there
be
plenty
to
lend
money
to
the
son
of
the
great
millionaire
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
after
eighteen
month
"
trial
of
a
university
education
,
Sir
Roger
have
no
alternative
but
to
withdraw
his
son
from
his
_
alma
mater
_
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
he
then
to
do
with
him
?
<EOS>
Unluckily
<EOS>
it
be
consider
quite
unnecessary
to
take
any
step
towards
enable
him
to
earn
his
bread
.
<EOS>
now
nothing
on
earth
can
be
more
difficult
than
bring
up
well
a
young
man
who
have
not
to
earn
his
own
bread
,
and
who
have
no
recognise
station
among
other
man
similarly
circumstance
.
<EOS>
juvenile
duke
,
and
sprouting
earl
,
find
their
duty
and
their
place
as
easily
as
embryo
clergyman
and
suck
barrister
.
<EOS>
provision
be
make
for
their
peculiar
position
:
and
,
though
they
may
possibly
go
astray
,
they
have
a
fair
chance
give
to
them
of
run
within
the
post
.
<EOS>
the
same
may
be
say
of
such
youth
as
Frank
Gresham
.
<EOS>
there
be
enough
of
them
in
the
community
to
have
make
it
necessary
that
their
well
-
being
should
be
a
matter
of
care
and
forethought
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
but
few
man
turn
out
in
the
world
in
the
position
of
Louis
Scatcherd
;
and
,
of
those
few
,
but
very
few
enter
the
real
battle
of
life
under
good
auspex
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Sir
Roger
,
though
he
have
hardly
time
with
all
his
multitudinous
railway
to
look
into
this
thoroughly
,
have
a
glimmering
of
it
.
<EOS>
when
he
see
his
son
's
pale
face
,
and
pay
his
wine
bill
,
and
hear
of
his
doing
in
horse
-
flesh
,
he
do
know
that
thing
be
not
go
well
;
he
do
understand
that
the
heir
to
a
baronetcy
and
a
fortune
of
some
ten
thousand
a
year
may
be
do
better
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
he
to
do
?
<EOS>
He
could
not
watch
over
his
boy
himself
;
so
he
take
a
tutor
for
him
and
send
him
abroad
.
  
<EOS>
Louis
and
the
tutor
get
as
far
as
Berlin
,
with
what
mutual
satisfaction
to
each
other
need
not
be
specially
describe
.
<EOS>
but
from
Berlin
Sir
Roger
receive
a
letter
in
which
the
tutor
decline
to
go
any
further
in
the
task
which
he
have
undertake
.
<EOS>
He
find
that
he
have
no
influence
over
his
pupil
,
and
he
could
not
reconcile
it
to
his
conscience
to
be
the
spectator
of
such
a
life
as
that
which
Mr
Scatcherd
lead
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
power
in
induce
Mr
Scatcherd
to
leave
Berlin
;
but
he
would
remain
there
himself
till
he
should
hear
from
Sir
Roger
.
<EOS>
so
Sir
Roger
have
to
leave
the
huge
Government
work
which
he
be
then
erect
on
the
southern
coast
,
and
hurry
off
to
Berlin
to
see
what
could
be
do
with
young
hopeful
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
Hopeful
be
by
no
mean
a
fool
;
and
in
some
matter
be
more
than
a
match
for
his
father
.
<EOS>
Sir
Roger
,
in
his
anger
,
threaten
to
cast
him
off
without
a
shilling
.
<EOS>
Louis
,
with
mixed
penitence
and
effrontery
,
remind
him
that
he
could
not
change
the
descent
of
the
title
;
promise
amendment
;
declare
that
he
have
do
only
as
do
other
young
man
of
fortune
;
and
hint
that
the
tutor
be
a
strait
-
laced
ass
.
<EOS>
the
father
and
the
son
return
together
to
Boxall
Hill
,
and
three
month
afterwards
Mr
Scatcherd
set
up
for
himself
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
his
life
,
if
not
more
virtuous
,
be
more
crafty
than
it
have
be
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
tutor
to
watch
his
doing
and
complain
of
them
,
and
he
have
sufficient
sense
to
keep
himself
from
absolute
pecuniary
ruin
.
<EOS>
He
live
,
<EOS>
it
be
true
,
where
sharper
and
blackleg
have
too
often
opportunity
of
pluck
him
;
but
,
young
as
he
be
,
he
have
be
sufficiently
long
about
the
world
to
take
care
<EOS>
he
be
not
openly
rob
;
and
as
he
be
not
openly
rob
,
his
father
,
in
a
certain
sense
,
be
proud
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
tiding
,
however
,
come
 
<EOS>
come
at
least
in
those
last
day
 
which
cut
Sir
Roger
to
the
quick
;
tiding
of
vice
in
the
son
which
the
father
could
not
but
attribute
to
his
own
example
.
<EOS>
twice
the
mother
be
call
up
to
the
sick
-
bed
of
her
only
child
,
while
he
lie
rave
in
that
horrid
madness
by
which
the
outraged
mind
avenge
itself
on
the
body
!
<EOS>
twice
he
be
find
rage
in
delirium
tremen
,
and
twice
the
father
be
tell
that
a
continuance
of
such
life
must
end
in
an
early
death
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
easily
be
conceive
that
Sir
Roger
be
not
a
happy
man
.
<EOS>
lie
there
with
that
brandy
bottle
beneath
his
pillow
,
reflect
in
his
moment
of
rest
that
that
son
of
his
have
his
brandy
bottle
beneath
his
pillow
,
he
could
hardly
have
be
happy
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
not
a
man
to
say
much
about
his
misery
.
<EOS>
though
he
could
restrain
neither
himself
nor
his
heir
,
he
could
endure
in
silence
;
and
in
silence
he
do
endure
,
till
,
open
his
eye
to
the
consciousness
of
death
,
he
at
last
speak
a
few
word
to
the
only
friend
he
know
.
  
<EOS>
Louis
Scatcherd
be
not
a
fool
,
nor
be
he
naturally
,
perhaps
,
of
a
depraved
disposition
;
but
he
have
to
reap
the
fruit
of
the
bad
education
which
England
be
able
to
give
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
moment
in
his
life
when
he
feel
that
a
well
,
a
high
,
nay
,
a
much
happy
career
be
open
to
him
than
that
which
he
have
prepare
himself
to
lead
.
<EOS>
now
and
then
he
would
reflect
what
money
and
rank
may
have
do
for
him
;
he
would
look
with
wishful
eye
to
the
proud
doing
of
other
of
his
age
;
would
dream
of
quiet
joy
,
of
a
sweet
wife
,
of
a
house
to
which
may
be
ask
friend
who
be
neither
jockey
nor
drunkard
;
he
would
dream
of
such
thing
in
his
short
interval
of
constrain
sobriety
;
but
the
dream
would
only
serve
to
make
him
moody
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
good
side
of
his
character
;
the
bad
,
probably
,
be
that
which
be
bring
into
play
by
the
fact
that
he
be
not
a
fool
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
a
well
chance
of
redemption
in
this
world
 
perhaps
also
in
another
 
have
he
be
a
fool
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
he
be
no
fool
:
he
be
not
to
be
do
,
not
he
;
he
know
,
no
one
well
,
the
value
of
a
shilling
;
he
know
,
also
,
how
to
keep
his
shilling
,
and
how
to
spend
them
.
<EOS>
He
consort
much
with
blackleg
and
such
-
like
,
because
blackleg
be
to
his
taste
.
<EOS>
but
he
boast
daily
,
nay
,
hourly
to
himself
,
and
frequently
to
those
around
him
,
that
the
leech
who
be
stick
round
him
could
draw
but
little
blood
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
spend
his
money
freely
;
but
he
would
so
spend
it
that
he
himself
may
reap
the
gratification
of
the
expenditure
.
<EOS>
He
be
acute
,
crafty
,
know
,
and
up
to
every
damnable
dodge
practise
by
man
of
the
class
with
whom
he
live

<EOS>
at
one

twenty
he
be
that
most
odious
of
all
odious
character
 
a
close

fisted
reprobate
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
a
small
man
,
not
ill
-
make
by
nature
,
but
reduce
to
unnatural
tenuity
by
dissipation
 
a
corporeal
attribute
of
which
he
be
apt
to
boast
,
as
it
enable
him
,
as
he

,
to
put
himself
up
at
7

7
lb

<EOS>
without
any
"

nonsense
of

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
power
,
however
,
be
one
of
which
he
do
not
often
avail
himself
,
as
his
nerve
be
seldom
in
a
fit
state
for
ride
.
<EOS>
His
hair
be
dark
red
,
and
he
wear
red
moustache
,
and
a
great
deal
of
red
beard
beneath
his
chin
,
cut
in
a
manner
to
make
him
look
like
an
American
.
<EOS>
His
voice
also
have
a
Yankee
twang
,
be
a
cross
between
that
of
an
american
trader
and
an
english
groom
;
and
his
eye
be
keen
and
fix
,
and
cold
and
knowing
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
son
whom
Sir
Roger
see
stand
at
his
bedside
when
first
he
awake
to
consciousness
.
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
suppose
that
Sir
Roger
look
at
him
with
our
eye
.
<EOS>
to
him
he
be
an
only
child
,
the
heir
of
his
wealth
,
the
future
bearer
of
his
title
;
the
most
heart
-
stir
remembrancer
of
those
other
day
,
when
he
have
be
so
much
a
poor
,
and
so
much
a
happy
man
.
<EOS>
let
that
boy
be
bad
or
good
,
he
be
all
Sir
Roger
have
;
and
the
father
be
still
able
to
hope
,
when
other
think
that
all
ground
for
hope
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
the
mother
also
love
her
son
with
a
mother
's
natural
love
;
but
Louis
have
ever
be
ashamed
of
his
mother
,
and
have
,
as
far
as
possible
,
estrange
himself
from
her
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
,
perhaps
,
fix
itself
with
almost
a
warm
love
on
Frank
Gresham
,
her
foster
-
son
.
<EOS>
Frank
she
see
but
seldom
,
but
when
she
do
see
him
he
never
refuse
her
embrace
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
too
,
a
joyous
,
genial
lustre
about
Frank
's
face
which
always
endear
him
to
woman
,
and
make
his
former
nurse
regard
him
as
the
pet
creation
of
the
age
.
<EOS>
though
she
but
seldom
interfere
with
any
monetary
arrangement
of
her
husband
's
,
yet
once
or
twice
she
have
venture
to
hint
that
a
legacy
leave
to
the
young
squire
would
make
her
a
happy
woman
.
<EOS>
Sir
Roger
,
however
,
on
these
occasion
have
not
appear
very
desirous
of
make
his
wife
happy
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
Louis
!
<EOS>
be
that
you
?
"
<EOS>
ejaculate
Sir
Roger
,
in
tone
hardly
more
than
half
-
form
:
afterwards
,
in
a
day
or
two
that
is
,
he
fully
recover
his
voice
;
but
just
then
he
could
hardly
open
his
jaw
,
and
speak
almost
through
his
tooth
.
<EOS>
He
manage
,
however
,
to
put
out
his
hand
and
lie
it
on
the
counterpane
,
so
that
his
son
could
take
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
that
be
well
,
governor
,
"
say
the
son
;
"
you
will
be
as
right
as
a
trivet
in
a
day
or
two
 
eh
,
governor
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
"
governor
"
smile
with
a
ghastly
smile
.
<EOS>
He
already
pretty
well
know
that
he
would
never
again
be
"
right
,
"
as
his
son
call
it
,
on
that
side
of
the
grave
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
,
moreover
,
suit
him
to
say
much
just
at
that
moment
,
so
he
content
himself
with
hold
his
son
's
hand
.
<EOS>
He
lie
still
in
this
position
for
a
moment
,
and
then
,
turn
round
painfully
on
his
side
,
endeavour
to
put
his
hand
to
the
place
where
his
dire
enemy
usually
be
conceal
.
<EOS>
Sir
Roger
,
however
,
be
too
weak
now
to
be
his
own
master
;
he
be
at
length
,
though
too
late
,
a
captive
in
the
hand
of
nurse
and
doctor
,
and
the
bottle
have
now
be
remove
.
  
<EOS>
then
Lady
Scatcherd
come
in
,
and
see
that
her
husband
be
no
longer
unconscious
,
she
could
not
but
believe
that
Dr
Thorne
have
be
wrong
;
she
could
not
but
think
that
there
must
be
some
ground
for
hope
.
<EOS>
She
throw
herself
on
her
knee
at
the
bedside
,
burst
into
tear
as
she
do
so
,
and
take
Sir
Roger
's
hand
in
her
cover
it
with
kiss
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bother
!
"
say
Sir
Roger
.
  
<EOS>
She
do
not
,
however
,
long
occupy
herself
with
the
indulgence
of
her
feeling
;
but
go
speedily
to
work
,
produce
such
sustenance
as
the
doctor
have
order
to
be
give
when
the
patient
may
awake
.
<EOS>
a
breakfast
-
cup
be
bring
to
him
,
and
a
few
drop
be
put
into
his
mouth
;
but
he
soon
make
it
manifest
that
he
would
take
nothing
more
of
a
description
so
perfectly
innocent
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
drop
of
brandy
 
just
a
little
drop
,
"
say
he
,
half
-
ordering
,
and
half
-
entreating
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
Roger
!
"
say
Lady
Scatcherd
.
  
<EOS>
"
just
a
little
drop
,
Louis
,
"
say
the
sick
man
,
appeal
to
his
son
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
little
will
be
good
for
him
;
bring
the
bottle
,
mother
,
"
say
the
son
.
  
<EOS>
after
some
altercation
the
brandy
bottle
be
bring
,
and
Louis
,
with
what
he
think
a
very
sparing
hand
,
proceed
to
pour
about
half
a
wine
-
glassful
into
the
cup
.
<EOS>
as
he
do
so
,
Sir
Roger
,
weak
as
he
be
,
contrive
to
shake
his
son
's
arm
,
so
as
greatly
to
increase
the
dose
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
"
laugh
the
sick
man
,
and
then
greedily
swallow
the
dose
.
   
<EOS>
Sir
Roger
die
 
<EOS>
that
night
the
doctor
stay
at
Boxall
Hill
,
and
the
next
night
;
so
that
it
become
a
customary
thing
for
him
to
sleep
there
during
the
latter
part
of
Sir
Roger
's
illness
.
<EOS>
He
return
home
daily
to
Greshamsbury
;
for
he
have
his
patient
there
,
to
whom
he
be
as
necessary
as
to
Sir
Roger
,
the
foremost
of
whom
be
Lady
Arabella
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
therefore
,
no
slight
work
on
his
hand
,
see
that
his
night
be
by
no
means
wholly
devoted
to
rest
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Rerechild
have
not
be
much
wrong
as
to
the
remain
space
of
life
which
he
have
allot
to
the
die
man
.
<EOS>
once
or
twice
Dr
Thorne
have
think
that
the
great
original
strength
of
his
patient
would
have
enable
him
to
fight
against
death
for
a
somewhat
long
period
;
but
Sir
Roger
would
give
himself
no
chance
.
<EOS>
whenever
he
be
strong
enough
to
have
a
will
of
his
own
,
he
insist
on
have
his
very
medicine
mix
with
brandy
;
and
in
the
hour
of
the
doctor
's
absence
,
he
be
too
often
successful
in
his
attempt
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
do
not
much
matter
,
"
Dr
Thorne
have
say
to
Lady
Scatcherd
.
<EOS>
"
do
what
you
can
to
keep
down
the
quantity
,
but
do
not
irritate
him
by
refuse
to
obey
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
much
signify
now
.
"
<EOS>
so
Lady
Scatcherd
still
administer
the
alcohol
,
and
he
from
day
to
day
invent
little
scheme
for
increase
the
amount
,
over
which
he
chuckle
with
ghastly
laughter
.
  
<EOS>
two
or
three
time
during
these
day
Sir
Roger
essay
to
speak
seriously
to
his
son
;
but
Louis
always
frustrate
him
.
<EOS>
He
either
get
out
of
the
room
on
some
excuse
,
or
make
his
mother
interfere
on
the
score
that
so
much
talk
would
be
bad
for
his
father
.
<EOS>
He
already
know
with
tolerable
accuracy
<EOS>
what
be
the
purport
of
his
father
's
will
,
and
by
no
mean
approve
of
it
;
but
as
he
could
not
now
hope
to
induce
his
father
to
alter
it
so
as
to
make
it
more
favourable
to
himself
,
he
conceive
that
no
conversation
on
matter
of
business
could
be
of
use
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Louis
,
"
say
Sir
Roger
,
one
afternoon
to
his
son
;
"
Louis

I

besides

it
be
not

five

quite
right

as
for
you

why

you
will
be
up
and
about
yourself
in
another
month

so

I
shall
never

off
this
bed

on
those
chair
there

I

not

you

what

before
you

accurse
bottle

<EOS>

I
be
all
right

governor

right
as
a
trivet

It

I
take

at

so

father

up

this
sort
of
thing
be
not
the
thing
for
you
at
all

<EOS>
I
wonder
where
mother
be
:
she
ought
to
be
here
with
the
broth
;
just
let
me
go
,
and
I
will
see
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
father
understand
it
all
.
<EOS>
He
see
that
it
be
now
much
beyond
his
fade
power
to
touch
the
heart
or
conscience
of
such
a
youth
as
his
son
have
become
.
<EOS>
what
now
could
he
do
for
his
boy
except
die
?
<EOS>
what
else
,
what
other
benefit
,
do
his
son
require
of
him
but
to
die
;
to
die
so
that
his
mean
of
dissipation
may
be
unbounde
?
<EOS>
He
let
go
the
unresisting
hand
which
he
hold
,
and
,
as
the
young
man
creep
out
of
the
room
,
he
turn
his
face
to
the
wall
.
<EOS>
He
turn
his
face
to
the
wall
and
hold
bitter
commune
with
his
own
heart
.
<EOS>
to
what
have
he
bring
himself
?
<EOS>
to
what
have
he
bring
his
son
?
<EOS>
oh
,
how
happy
would
it
have
be
for
him
<EOS>
could
he
have
remain
all
his
day
a
work
stone
-
mason
in
Barchester
!
<EOS>
how
happy
could
he
have
die
as
such
,
year
ago
!
<EOS>
such
tear
as
those
which
wet
that
pillow
be
the
bitter
which
human
eye
can
shed
.
  
<EOS>
but
while
they
be
drop
,
the
memoir
of
his
life
be
in
quick
course
of
preparation
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
indeed
,
nearly
complete
,
with
considerable
detail
.
<EOS>
He
have
linger
on
four
day
longer
than
may
have
be
expect
,
and
the
author
have
thus
have
more
than
usual
time
for
the
work
.
<EOS>
in
these
day
a
man
be
nobody
unless
his
biography
be
keep
so
far
post
up
that
it
may
be
ready
for
the
national
breakfast
-
table
on
the
morning
after
his
demise
.
<EOS>
when
it
chance
that
the
dead
hero
be
one
who
be
take
in
his
prime
of
life
,
of
whose
departure
from
among
us
the
most
far
-
see
biographical
scribe
can
have
no
prophetic
inkling
,
this
must
be
difficult
.
<EOS>
of
great
man
,
full
of
year
,
who
be
ripe
for
the
sickle
,
who
in
the
course
of
Nature
must
soon
fall
,
it
be
of
course
comparatively
easy
for
an
active
compiler
to
have
his
complete
memoir
ready
in
his
desk
.
<EOS>
but
in
order
that
the
idea
of
omnipresent
and
omniscient
information
may
be
keep
up
,
the
young
must
be
chronicle
as
quickly
as
the
old
.
<EOS>
in
some
case
this
task
must
,
one
would
say
,
be
difficult
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
it
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
the
memoir
of
Sir
Roger
Scatcherd
be
progress
favourably
.
<EOS>
in
this
it
be
tell
how
fortunate
have
be
his
life
;
how
,
in
his
case
,
industry
and
genius
combine
have
triumph
over
the
difficulty
which
humble
birth
and
deficient
education
have
throw
in
his
way
;
how
he
have
make
a
name
among
England
's
great
man
;
how
the
Queen
have
delight
to
honour
him
,
and
noble
have
be
proud
to
have
him
for
a
guest
at
their
mansion
.
<EOS>
then
follow
a
list
of
all
the
great
work
which
he
have
achieve
,
of
the
railroad
,
canal
,
dock
,
harbour
,
jails
,
and
hospital
which
he
have
construct
.
<EOS>
His
name
be
hold
up
as
an
example
to
the
labour
class
of
his
countryman
,
and
he
be
point
at
as
one
who
have
live
and
die
happy
 
<EOS>
ever
happy
,
say
the
biographer
,
because
ever
industrious
.
<EOS>
and
so
a
great
moral
question
be
inculcate
.
<EOS>
a
short
paragraph
be
devoted
to
his
appearance
in
Parliament
;
and
unfortunate
Mr
Romer
be
again
hold
up
for
disgrace
,
for
the
thirtieth
time
,
as
have
be
the
mean
of
deprive
our
legislative
council
of
the
great
assistance
of
Sir
Roger
's
experience
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Roger
,
"
say
the
biographer
in
his
conclude
passage
,
"
be
possess
of
an
iron
frame
;
but
even
iron
will
yield
to
the
repeat
blow
of
the
hammer
.
<EOS>
in
the
latter
year
of
his
life
he
be
know
to
overtask
himself
;
and
at
length
the
body
give
way
,
though
the
mind
remain
firm
to
the
_
<EOS>
last
_
.
<EOS>
the
subject
of
this
memoir
be
only
fifty
-
nine
when
he
be
take
from
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
thus
Sir
Roger
's
life
be
write
,
while
the
tear
be
yet
fall
on
his
pillow
at
Boxall
Hill
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
that
a
proof
-
sheet
could
not
have
be
send
to
him
.
<EOS>
no
man
be
vainer
of
his
reputation
,
and
it
would
have
greatly
gratify
him
to
know
that
posterity
be
about
to
speak
of
him
in
such
term
 
to
speak
of
him
with
a
voice
that
would
be
audible
for
twenty
-
four
hour
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Roger
make
no
further
attempt
to
give
counsel
to
his
son
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
evidently
useless
.
<EOS>
the
old
die
lion
feel
that
the
lion
's
power
have
already
pass
from
him
,
and
that
he
be
helpless
in
the
hand
of
the
young
cub
who
be
so
soon
to
inherit
the
wealth
of
the
forest
.
<EOS>
but
Dr
Thorne
be
more
kind
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
something
yet
to
say
as
to
his
worldly
hope
and
worldly
care
;
and
his
old
friend
do
not
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
during
the
night
that
Sir
Roger
be
most
anxious
to
talk
,
and
most
capable
of
talk
.
<EOS>
He
would
lie
through
the
day
in
a
state
half
-
comatose
;
but
towards
evening
he
would
rouse
himself
,
and
by
midnight
he
would
be
full
of
fitful
energy
.
<EOS>
one
night
,
as
he
lie
wakeful
and
full
of
thought
,
he
thus
pour
forth
his
whole
heart
to
Dr
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thorne
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
tell
you
about
my
will
,
you
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
the
other
;
"
and
I
have
blame
myself
greatly
that
I
have
not
again
urge
you
to
alter
it
.
<EOS>
Your
illness
come
too
suddenly
,
Scatcherd
;
and
then
I
be
averse
to
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
I
alter
it
?
<EOS>
It
be
a
good
will
;
as
good
as
I
can
make
.
<EOS>
not
but
that
I
have
alter
it
since
I
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
it
that
day
after
you
leave
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
definitely
name
your
heir
in
default
of
Louis
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
no
 
<EOS>
that
be
 
<EOS>
yes
 
I
have
do
that
before
;
I
have
say
Mary
's
eld
child
:
<EOS>
I
have
not
alter
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Scatcherd
,
you
must
alter
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Must
!
<EOS>
well
then
I
will
not
;
but
I
will
tell
you
what
I
have
do
.
<EOS>
I
have
add
a
postscript
 
a
codicil
they
call
it
 
say
that
you
,
and
you
only
,
know
who
be
her
eld
child
.
<EOS>
Winterbones
and
Jack
Martin
have
witness
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
be
go
to
explain
how
very
injudicious
such
an
arrangement
appear
to
be
;
but
Sir
Roger
would
not
listen
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
about
that
that
he
wish
to
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
to
him
it
be
matter
of
but
minor
interest
who
may
inherit
his
money
if
his
son
should
die
early
;
his
care
be
solely
for
his
son
's
welfare
.
<EOS>
at
twenty
-
five
the
heir
may
make
his
own
will
 
<EOS>
may
bequeath
all
this
wealth
accord
to
his
own
fancy
.
<EOS>
Sir
Roger
would
not
bring
himself
to
believe
that
his
son
could
follow
him
to
the
grave
in
so
short
a
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
never
mind
that
,
doctor
,
now
;
but
about
Louis
;
you
will
be
his
guardian
,
you
know

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
his
guardian

more
than
of
age

"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>

doctor
,
you
will
be
his
guardian

property
will

be
twenty

five

You
will
not
desert
him

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
desert
him
;
but
I
doubt
whether
I
can
do
much
for
him
 
<EOS>
what
can
I
do
,
Scatcherd
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

use
the
power
that
a
strong
man
have
over
a

one

the
power

my
will
will
give
you

do
for
him

you
would
for
a

of
your
own

you
see
him
go
in
bad
course

as

so
for
you

<EOS>
"
what
I
can
do

that
I
will
do

say
Thorne

solemnly
,
take
as
he
speak
the
contractor
's
hand
in
his
own
with
a
tight
grasp

I
know
you

may
you

I

you
on
your

bed
have
no
dread

I

the
fate

you

"
  
<EOS>
Doctor
Thorne
feel
that
he
could
not
say
much
in
answer
to
this
.
<EOS>
the
future
fate
of
Louis
Scatcherd
be
,
he
could
not
but
own
to
himself
,
greatly
to
be
dread
.
<EOS>
what
good
,
what
happiness
,
could
be
presage
for
such
a
one
as
he
be
?
<EOS>
what
comfort
could
he
offer
to
the
father
?
<EOS>
and
then
he
be
call
on
to
compare
,
as
it
be
,
the
prospect
of
this
unfortunate
with
those
of
his
own
darling
;
to
contrast
all
that
be
murky
,
foul
,
and
dishearten
,
with
all
that
be
perfect
 
for
to
him
she
be
all
but
perfect
;
to
liken
Louis
Scatcherd
to
the
angel
who
brighten
his
own
hearthstone
.
<EOS>
how
could
he
answer
to
such
an
appeal
?
  
<EOS>
He
say
nothing
;
but
merely
tighten
his
grasp
of
the
other
's
hand
,
to
signify
that
he
would
do
,
as
best
he
could
,
all
that
be
ask
of
him
.
<EOS>
Sir
Roger
look
up
sadly
into
the
doctor
's
face
,
as
though
expect
some
word
of
consolation
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
comfort
,
no
consolation
to
come
to
him
!
  
<EOS>
"
for
three
or
four
year
he
must
greatly
depend
upon
you
,
"
continue
Sir
Roger

<EOS>
"
I
will
do
what
I
can

say
the
doctor

<EOS>
"
what
I
can
do
I
will
do

he
be
not
a
child

Scatcherd

at
his
age
he
must
stand
or
fall
mainly
by
his
own
conduct

the
good
thing
for
him
will
be
to
marry

be
just
it

Thorne

I
be
come
to
that

if
he
would

I
think
he
would
do
well
yet

for
all
that
have
come

go

if
he
marry

I
will
be
govern
entirely
by
your

under
any
circumstance
his
income
will

I
understand

be
quite
sufficient

Thorne

have
I
make
the
money

now
if
he

decently

that
is
 
some
woman

know
that
can
assist
him
in
the
world

let
him
have
what
he
want

I
put
it
into
your
hand

"
no
,
Scatcherd

not
to
save
the
money
,

to
save
him

I
think
that
while
you
be
yet
with
him
you
should
advise
him
to
marry
.

<EOS>
"
He
do
not
care
a
straw
for
what
I
advise

not

why
should

sober

He
fear

raise

half
a
glass
of
brandy

<EOS>
the
doctor
turn
round
in
his
chair
;
but
he
hesitate
in
do
as
he
be
desire
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
as
I
ask
you
,
doctor
.
<EOS>
It
can
do
no
harm
now
;
you
know
that
well
enough
.
<EOS>
why
torture
me
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

I
will
not
torture
you

you
will
have
water
with
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
water
!
<EOS>
no
;
the
brandy
by
itself
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
I
can
not
speak
without
it
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
use
of
cant
now
?
<EOS>
You
know
it
can
make
no
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Roger
be
right
.
<EOS>
It
could
make
no
difference
;
and
Dr
Thorne
give
him
the
half
glass
of
brandy
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
well
;
you
have
a
stingy
hand
,
doctor
;
confound
stingy
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
measure
your
medicine
out
in
such
light
dose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
want
more
before
morning
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
before
morning
!
<EOS>
indeed
I
shall
;
a
pint
or
so
before
that
.
<EOS>
I
remember
the
time
,
doctor
,
when
I
have
drunk
to
my
own
cheek
above
two
quart
between
dinner
and
breakfast
!
<EOS>
aye
,
and
work
all
the
day
after
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
be
a
wonderful
man
,
Scatcherd
,
very
wonderful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
aye
,
wonderful
!
<EOS>
well
,
never
mind
.
<EOS>
It
be
over
now
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
I
say
?
 
<EOS>
about
Louis
,
doctor
;
you
will
not
desert
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
certainly
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
be
not
strong
;
I
know
that
.
<EOS>
how
should
he
be
strong
,
live
as
he
have
do
?
<EOS>
not
that
it
seem
to
hurt
me
when
I
be
his
age
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
the
advantage
of
hard
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
it
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
wish
that
Louis
have
not
a
shilling
in
the
world
;
that
he
have
to
trudge
about
with
an
apron
round
his
waist
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
too
late
now
to
think
of
that
.
<EOS>
if
he
would
only
marry
,
doctor
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
again
express
an
opinion
that
no
step
would
be
so
likely
to
reform
the
habit
of
the
young
heir
as
marriage
;
and
repeat
his
advice
to
the
father
to
implore
his
son
to
take
a
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
,
Thorne
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
after
a
pause
,
he
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
half
tell
you
as
yet
<EOS>
what
be
on
my
mind
;
and
I
be
nearly
afraid
to
tell
it
;
though
,
indeed
,
I
do
not
know
why
I
should
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
know
you
afraid
of
anything
yet

"
say
the
doctor
,
smile
gently
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
I
will
not
end
by
turn
coward
.
<EOS>
now
,
doctor
,
tell
the
truth
to
me
;
what
do
you
expect
me
to
do
for
that
girl
of
yours
that
we
be
talk
of
 
Mary
's
child
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
pause
for
a
moment
,
for
Thorne
be
slow
to
answer
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
not
let
me
see
her

slowly
.

<EOS>

She
will
have
it
all

should
die

say
Sir

<EOS>
"

you
intend
it
so
you
should
put
her

into

will

say
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
not
that
I
ask
you

you

God

can
do
without

the
two
cousin
be
man

let
Louis
marry
poor
Mary

child

"
  
<EOS>
the
proposition
for
a
moment
take
away
the
doctor
's
breath
,
and
he
be
unable
to
answer
.
<EOS>
not
for
all
the
wealth
of
India
would
he
have
give
up
his
lamb
to
that
young
wolf
,
even
though
he
have
have
the
power
to
do
so

lamb

as
he
well
know

a
will
of
her
own
on
such
a
matter

<EOS>
what
alliance
could
be
more
impossible
,
think
he
to
himself
,
than
one
between
Mary
Thorne
and
Louis
Scatcherd
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
alter
it
all

your

upon

about

<EOS>
but
Dr
Thorne
do
not

the
word
;
just
at
the
moment
he
say
nothing
,

he
slowly
shake
his
head

Thorne

yes

everything

the
one
thing
that
will
save
him

well
,
I
will
not
ask
you
again

remember
,

I
shall
alter
my
will
to

morrow

do
so
by
all

you
may
well
alter
it
for
the
well

if
I
may
advise
you
,
you
will
have
down
your
own
business
attorney
from
London
.

if
you
will
let
me
send

will
be
here
before

morrow
night

"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
for
nothing

Thorne

I
can
manage
that
matter
myself

now
leave
me
;

remember
,
you
have
ruin
that
girl
's
fortune
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
do
leave
him
,
and
go
not
altogether
happy
to
his
room
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
but
confess
to
himself
that
he
have
,
despite
himself
as
it
be
,
feed
himself
with
hope
that
Mary
's
future
may
be
make
more
secure
,
aye
,
and
brighter
too
,
by
some
small
unheeded
fraction
break
off
from
the
huge
mass
of
her
uncle
's
wealth
.
<EOS>
such
hope
,
if
it
have
amount
to
hope
,
be
now
all
go
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
all
,
nor
be
this
the
bad
of
it
.
<EOS>
that
he
have
do
right
in
utterly
repudiate
all
idea
of
a
marriage
between
Mary
and
her
cousin
 
of
that
he
be
certain
enough
;
that
no
earthly
consideration
would
have
induce
Mary
to
plight
her
troth
to
such
a
man
 
that
,
with
him
,
be
as
certain
as
doom
.
<EOS>
but
how
far
have
he
do
right
in
keep
her
from
the
sight
of
her
uncle
?
<EOS>
how
could
he
justify
it
to
himself
if
he
have
thus
rob
her
of
her
inheritance
,
see
that
he
have
do
so
from
a
selfish
fear
lest
she
,
who
be
now
all
his
own
,
should
be
know
to
the
world
as
belong
to
other
rather
than
to
him
?
<EOS>
He
have
take
upon
him
on
her
behalf
to
reject
wealth
as
valueless
;
and
yet
he
have
no
sooner
do
so
than
he
begin
to
consume
his
hour
with
reflect
how
great
to
her
would
be
the
value
of
wealth
.
<EOS>
and
thus
,
when
Sir
Roger
tell
him
,
as
he
leave
the
room
,
that
he
have
ruin
Mary
's
fortune
,
he
be
hardly
able
to
bear
the
taunt
with
equanimity
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
next
morning
,
after
pay
his
professional
visit
to
his
patient
,
and
satisfy
himself
that
the
end

near

step
terribly
quicken

you

he

"
  
<EOS>
that

night
Dr
Thorne
again
find
himself
alone
with
Sir

<EOS>
the
sick
man
be
much
more
tranquil
,
and
apparently
more
at
ease
than
he
have
be
on
the
precede
night
.
<EOS>
He
say
nothing
about
his
will
,
and
not
a
word
about
Mary
Thorne
;
but
the
doctor
know
that
Winterbones
and
a
notary
's
clerk
from
Barchester
have
be
in
the
bedroom
a
great
part
of
the
day
;
and
,
as
he
know
also
that
the
great
man
of
business
be
accustomed
to
do
his
most
important
work
by
the
hand
of
such
tool
as
these
,
he
do
not
doubt
but
that
the
will
have
be
alter
and
remodelle
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
think
it
more
than
probable
,
that
when
it
be
open
it
would
be
find
to
be
wholly
different
in
its
provision
from
that
which
Sir
Roger
have
already
describe

<EOS>
"
Louis
be
clever
enough

he

,

sharp
enough

<EOS>
He
may
do
well

very

if

and
Sir

hold
up
the
empty
wine
-
glass
which
stand
by
his
bedside
.
<EOS>
"
what
a
life
he
may
have

as

speak
he
take
the

toss

across

would
that
it

I
do

what

I

he
ask

would
not
have
be
civil
to
have
tell
him
that
his

believe
me

heart
be
sad
 
sad
 
sad
to

a

never

right

He
have

look
to
Him

He
will
have
mercy

"
  
<EOS>
"
well
 
I
will
try

would
that
it
be
all
to
do
again

"
what

Lady

<EOS>
"

I
come
out
of
jail
that
time

the
poor
creature
have
hardly
a

to
her
foot

but
it
be
not

it
be

never

<EOS>
yes

she
have
be
a
good

better
for

then
,
that
be
what
she
be
bear
to

You

her
be
knock
about
by
them

you

Thorne

"
  
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
again
assure
him
,
that
as
long
as
he
live
Lady
Scatcherd
should
never
want
one
true
friend
;
in
make
this
promise
,
however
,
he
manage
to
drop
all
allusion
to
the
obnoxious
title
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
with
him
as
much
as
possible

will
not
you
?
"
<EOS>
again
ask
the
baronet
,
after
lie
quite
silent
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour

<EOS>
"
with
whom
?

the
doctor

who
be
then
all

asleep

with

me
,
I

say
the

and
,
doctor
,
when
you
see
a
glass
at
his
mouth
,
dash
it
down
;
thrust
it
down

though
you
thrust
out
the
tooth
with
it

<EOS>
when
you

tell
him
of
his

tell
him
what

may
have

for
that

how

"
  
<EOS>
these
,
reader
,
be
the
last
word
speak
by
Sir
Roger
Scatcherd
.
<EOS>
as
he
utter
them
he
rise
up
in
bed
with
the
same
vehemence
which
he
have
show
on
the
former
evening
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
very
act
of
do
so
he
be
again
strike
by
paralysis
,
and
before
nine
on
the
follow
morning
all
be
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
my
man
 
my
own
,
own
man
!
"
exclaim
the
widow
,
remember
in
the
paroxysm
of
her
grief
nothing
but
the
love
of
their
early
day
;
"
the
good
,
the
bright
,
the
clever
of
them
all

"
  
<EOS>
some
week
after
this
Sir
Roger
be
bury
,
with
much
pomp
and
ceremony
,
within
the
precinct
of
Barchester
Cathedral
;
and
a
monument
be
put
up
to
him
soon
after
,
in
which
he
be
portray
as
smooth
a
block
of
granite
with
a
mallet
and
chisel
;
while
his
eagle
eye
,
disdain
such
humble
work
,
be
fix
upon
some
intricate
mathematical
instrument
above
him
.
<EOS>
Could
Sir
Roger
have
see
it
himself
,
he
would
probably
have
declare
,
that
no
workman
be
ever
worth
his
salt
who
look
one
way
while
he
row
another
.
  
<EOS>
immediately
after
the
funeral
the
will
be
open
,
and
Dr
Thorne
discover
that
the
clause
of
it
be
exactly
identical
with
those
which
his
friend
have
describe
to
him
some
month
back
.
<EOS>
nothing
have
be
alter
;
nor
have
the
document
be
unfold
since
that
strange
codicil
be
add
,
in
which
it
be
declare
that
Dr
Thorne
know
 
and
<EOS>
only
Dr
Thorne
 
who
be
the
eld
child
of
the
testator
's
only
sister
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
however
,
a
joint
executor
with
Dr
Thorne
have
be
name
 
one
Mr
Stock
,
a
man
of
railway
fame
 
and
Dr
Thorne
himself
be
make
a
legatee
to
the
humble
extent
of
a
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
a
life
income
of
a
thousand
pound
a
year
be
leave
to
Lady
Scatcherd
.
   
<EOS>
war
 
<EOS>
We
need
not
follow
Sir
Roger
to
his
grave
,
nor
partake
of
the
baked
meat
which
be
furnish
for
his
funeral
banquet
.
<EOS>
such
man
as
Sir
Roger
Scatcherd
be
always
well
bury
,
and
we
have
already
see
that
his
glory
be
duly
tell
to
posterity
in
the
graphic
diction
of
his
sepulchral
monument
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
day
the
doctor
have
return
to
his
quiet
home
,
and
Sir
Louis
find
himself
reign
at
Boxall
Hill
in
his
father
's
stead
 
with
,
however
,
a
much
diminished
sway
,
and
,
as
he
think
it
,
but
a
poor
exchequer
.
<EOS>
We
must
soon
return
to
him
and
say
something
of
his
career
as
a
baronet
;
but
for
the
present
,
we
may
go
back
to
our
more
pleasant
friend
at
Greshamsbury
.
  
<EOS>
but
our
friend
at
Greshamsbury
have
not
be
make
themselves
pleasant
 
not
so
pleasant
to
each
other
as
circumstance
would
have
admit
.
<EOS>
in
those
day
which
the
doctor
have
feel
himself
bind
to
pass
,
if
not
altogether
at
Boxall
Hill
,
yet
altogether
away
from
his
own
home
,
so
as
to
admit
of
his
be
as
much
as
possible
with
his
patient
,
Mary
have
be
throw
more
than
ever
with
Patience
Oriel
,
and
,
also
,
almost
more
than
ever
with
Beatrice
Gresham
.
<EOS>
as
regard
Mary
,
she
would
doubtless
have
prefer
the
companionship
of
Patience
,
though
she
love
Beatrice
far
the
good
;
but
she
have
no
choice
.
<EOS>
when
she
go
to
the
parsonage
Beatrice
come
there
also
,
and
when
Patience
come
to
the
doctor
's
house
Beatrice
either
accompany
or
follow
her
.
<EOS>
Mary
could
hardly
have
reject
their
society
,
even
have
she
feel
it
wise
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
would
in
such
case
have
be
all
alone
,
and
her
severance
from
the
Greshamsbury
house
and
household
,
from
the
big
family
in
which
she
have
for
so
many
year
be
almost
at
home
,
would
have
make
such
solitude
almost
unendurable
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
these
two
girl
both
know
 
<EOS>
not
her
secret
<EOS>
:
she
have
no
secret
 
but
the
little
history
of
her
ill
-
treatment
.
<EOS>
They
know
that
though
she
have
be
blameless
in
this
matter
,
yet
she
have
be
the
one
to
bear
the
punishment
;
and
,
as
girl
and
bosom
friend
,
they
could
not
but
sympathise
with
her
,
and
endow
her
with
heroic
attribute
;
make
her
,
in
fact
,
as
we
be
do
,
their
little
heroine
for
the
nonce
.
<EOS>
this
be
,
perhaps
,
not
serviceable
for
Mary
;
but
it
be
far
from
be
disagreeable
.
  
<EOS>
the
tendency
to
find
matter
for
hero
-
worship
in
Mary
's
endurance
be
much
strong
with
Beatrice
than
with
Miss
Oriel
.
<EOS>
Miss
Oriel
be
the
elder
,
and
naturally
less
afflicted
with
the
sentimentation
of
romance
.
<EOS>
She
have
throw
herself
into
Mary
's
arm
because
she
have
see
that
it
be
essentially
necessary
for
Mary
's
comfort
that
she
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
be
anxious
to
make
her
friend
smile
,
and
to
smile
with
her
.
<EOS>
Beatrice
be
quite
as
true
in
her
sympathy
;
but
she
rather
wish
that
she
and
Mary
may
weep
in
unison
,
shed
mutual
tear
,
and
break
their
heart
together
.
  
<EOS>
patience
have
speak
of
Frank
's
love
as
a
misfortune
,
of
his
conduct
as
erroneous
,
and
to
be
excuse
only
by
his
youth
,
and
have
never
appear
to
surmise
that
Mary
also
may
be
in
love
as
well
as
he
.
<EOS>
but
to
Beatrice
the
affair
be
a
tragic
difficulty
,
admit
of
no
solution
;
a
Gordian
knot
,
not
to
be
cut
;
a
misery
now
and
for
ever
.
<EOS>
She
would
always
talk
about
Frank
when
she
and
Mary
be
alone
;
and
,
to
speak
the
truth
,
Mary
do
not
stop
her
as
she
perhaps
should
have
do
.
<EOS>
as
for
a
marriage
between
them
,
that
be
impossible
;
Beatrice
be
well
sure
of
that
:
it
be
Frank
's
unfortunate
destiny
that
he
must
marry
money
 
money
,
and
,
as
Beatrice
sometimes
thoughtlessly
add
,
cut
Mary
to
the
quick
,
 
money
and
family
also
.
<EOS>
under
such
circumstance
a
marriage
between
them
be
quite
impossible
;
but
not
the
less
do
Beatrice
declare
,
that
she
would
have
love
Mary
as
her
sister
-
in
-
law
have
it
be
possible
;
and
how
worthy
Frank
be
of
a
girl
's
love
,
have
such
love
be
permissible
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
so
cruel
,
"
Beatrice
would
say
;
"
so
very
,
very
,
cruel
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
suit
him
in
every
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nonsense
,
Trichy
;
I
should
have
suit
him
in
no
possible
way
at
all
;
nor
he
me
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
,
but
you
would
 
exactly
.
<EOS>
papa
love
you
so
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
mamma
;
that
would
have
be
so
nice
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
and
mamma
,
too
 
that
is
,
have
you
have
a
fortune
,
"
say
the
daughter
,
naïvely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
always
like
you
personally
,
always
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
she
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
always
.
<EOS>
and
we
all
love
you
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
especially
Lady
Alexandrina
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
that
would
not
have
signify
,
for
Frank
can
not
endure
the
de
Courcys
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
it
do
not
matter
one
straw
whom
your
brother
can
endure
or
not
endure
just
at
present
.
<EOS>
His
character
be
to
be
form
,
and
his
taste
,
and
his
heart
also
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
his
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
his
heart
;
not
the
fact
of
his
have
a
heart
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
have
a
heart
;
but
he
himself
do
not
yet
understand
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mary
!
<EOS>
you
do
not
know
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
such
conversation
be
not
without
danger
to
poor
Mary
's
comfort
.
<EOS>
It
come
soon
to
be
the
case
that
she
look
rather
for
this
sort
of
sympathy
from
Beatrice
,
than
for
Miss
Oriel
's
pleasant
but
less
piquant
gaiety
.
  
<EOS>
so
the
day
of
the
doctor
's
absence
be
pass
,
and
so
also
the
first
week
after
his
return
.
<EOS>
during
this
week
it
be
almost
daily
necessary
that
the
squire
should
be
with
him
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
be
now
the
legal
holder
of
Sir
Roger
's
property
,
and
,
as
such
,
the
holder
also
of
all
the
mortgage
on
Mr
Gresham
's
property
;
and
it
be
natural
that
they
should
be
much
together
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
would
not
,
however
,
go
up
to
Greshamsbury
on
any
other
than
medical
business
;
and
it
therefore
become
necessary
that
the
squire
should
be
a
good
deal
at
the
doctor
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
then
the
Lady
Arabella
become
unhappy
in
her
mind
.
<EOS>
Frank
,
it
be
true
,
be
away
at
Cambridge
,
and
have
be
successfully
keep
out
of
Mary
's
way
since
the
suspicion
of
danger
have
fall
upon
Lady
Arabella
's
mind
.
<EOS>
Frank
be
away
,
and
Mary
be
systematically
banish
,
with
due
acknowledgement
from
all
the
power
in
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
enough
for
Lady
Arabella
as
long
as
her
daughter
still
habitually
consort
with
the
female
culprit
,
and
as
long
as
her
husband
consort
with
the
male
culprit
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
Lady
Arabella
at
this
moment
as
though
,
in
banish
Mary
from
the
house
,
she
have
in
effect
banish
herself
from
the
most
intimate
of
the
Greshamsbury
social
circle
.
<EOS>
She
magnify
in
her
own
mind
the
importance
of
the
conference
between
the
girl
,
and
be
not
without
some
fear
that
the
doctor
may
be
talk
the
squire
over
into
very
dangerous
compliance
.
  
<EOS>
She
resolve
,
therefore
,
on
another
duel
with
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
she
have
be
pre
-
eminently
and
unexpectedly
successful
.
<EOS>
no
young
sucking
dove
could
have
be
more
mild
than
that
terrible
enemy
whom
she
have
for
year
regard
as
be
too
puissant
for
attack
.
<EOS>
in
ten
minute
she
have
vanquish
him
,
and
succeed
in
banish
both
him
and
his
niece
from
the
house
without
lose
the
value
of
his
service
.
<EOS>
as
be
always
the
case
with
us
,
she
have
begin
to
despise
the
enemy
she
have
conquer
,
and
to
think
that
the
foe
,
once
beat
,
could
never
rally
.
  
<EOS>
Her
object
be
to
break
off
all
confidential
intercourse
between
Beatrice
and
Mary
,
and
to
interrupt
,
as
far
as
she
could
do
it
,
<EOS>
that
between
the
doctor
and
the
squire
.
<EOS>
this
,
it
may
be
say
,
could
be
more
easily
do
by
skilful
management
within
her
own
household
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
however
,
try
that
and
fail
.
<EOS>
She
have
say
much
to
Beatrice
as
to
the
imprudence
of
her
friendship
with
Mary
,
and
she
have
do
this
purposely
before
the
squire
;
injudiciously
however
,
 
for
the
squire
have
immediately
take
Mary
's
part
,
and
have
declare
that
he
have
no
wish
to
see
a
quarrel
between
his
family
and
that
of
the
doctor
;
that
Mary
Thorne
be
in
every
way
a
good
girl
,
and
an
eligible
friend
for
his
own
child
;
and
have
end
by
declare
,
that
he
would
not
have
Mary
persecute
for
Frank
's
fault
.
<EOS>
this
have
not
be
the
end
,
nor
nearly
the
end
of
what
have
be
say
on
the
matter
at
Greshamsbury
;
but
the
end
,
when
it
come
,
come
in
this
wise
,
that
Lady
Arabella
determine
to
say
a
few
word
to
the
doctor
as
to
the
expediency
of
forbid
familiar
intercourse
between
Mary
and
any
of
the
Greshamsbury
people
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
view
Lady
Arabella
absolutely
beard
the
lion
in
his
den
,
the
doctor
in
his
shop
.
<EOS>
She
have
hear
that
both
Mary
and
Beatrice
be
to
pass
a
certain
afternoon
at
the
parsonage
,
and
take
that
opportunity
of
call
at
the
doctor
's
house
.
<EOS>
a
period
of
many
year
have
pass
since
she
have
last
<EOS>
so
honour
that
abode
.
<EOS>
Mary
,
indeed
,
have
be
so
much
one
of
her
own
family
that
the
ceremony
of
call
on
her
have
never
be
think
necessary
;
and
thus
,
unless
Mary
have
be
absolutely
ill
,
there
would
have
be
nothing
to
bring
her
ladyship
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
all
this
she
know
would
add
to
the
importance
of
the
occasion
,
and
she
judge
it
prudent
to
make
the
occasion
as
important
as
it
may
well
be
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
so
far
successful
that
she
soon
find
herself
<EOS>
_
tête
-
à
-
tête
_
with
the
doctor
in
his
own
study
.
<EOS>
She
be
no
whit
dismay
by
the
pair
of
human
thigh
-
bone
which
lie
close
to
his
hand
,
and
which
,
when
he
be
talk
in
that
den
of
his
own
,
he
be
in
the
constant
habit
of
handle
with
much
energy
;
nor
be
she
frighten
out
of
her
propriety
even
by
the
little
child
's
skull
which
grin
at
her
from
off
the
chimney
-
piece
.
  
<EOS>
"
Doctor
,
"
she
say
,
as
soon
as
the
first
complimentary
greeting
be
over
,
speak
in
her
kind
and
<EOS>
most
would
-
be
-
confidential
tone
,
"
doctor
,
I
be
still
uneasy
about
that
boy
of
mine
,
and
I
have
think
it
best
to
come
and
see
you
at
once
,
and
tell
you
freely
what
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
bow
,
and
say
that
he
be
very
sorry
that
she
should
have
any
cause
for
uneasiness
about
his
young
friend
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
I
be
very
uneasy
,
doctor
;
and
have
,
as
I
do
have
,
such
reliance
on
your
prudence
,
and
such
perfect
confidence
in
your
friendship
,
I
have
think
it
best
to
come
and
speak
to
you
openly
:
"
thereupon
the
Lady
Arabella
pause
,
and
the
doctor
bow
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
nobody
know
so
well
as
you
do
the
dreadful
state
of
the
squire
's
affair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
so
very
dreadful
;
not
so
very
dreadful
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
mildly
:
"
<EOS>
that
is
,
as
far
as
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
they
be
,
doctor
;
very
dreadful
;
very
dreadful
indeed
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
much
he
owe
to
this
young
man
:
I
do
not
,
for
the
squire
never
tell
anything
to
me
;
but
I
know
that
it
be
a
very
large
sum
of
money
;
enough
to
swamp
the
estate
and
ruin
Frank
.
<EOS>
now
I
call
that
very
dreadful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
not
ruin
him
,
Lady
Arabella
;
not
ruin
him
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
however
,
I
do
not
come
to
talk
to
you
about
that
.
<EOS>
as
I
say
before
,
I
know
nothing
of
the
squire
's
affair
,
and
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
I
do
not
ask
you
to
tell
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
sure
you
will
agree
with
me
in
this
,
that
,
as
a
mother
,
I
can
not
but
be
interested
about
my
only
son
,
"
and
Lady
Arabella
put
her
cambric
handkerchief
to
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
be
;
of
course
you
be
,
"
say
the
doctor
;
"
and
,
Lady
Arabella
,
my
opinion
of
Frank
be
such
,
that
I
feel
sure
that
he
will
do
well
;
"
and
,
in
his
energy
,
Dr
Thorne
brandish
one
of
the
thigh
-
bone
almost
in
the
lady
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
will
;
I
be
sure
I
hope
he
will
.
<EOS>
but
,
doctor
,
he
have
such
danger
to
contend
with
;
he
be
so
warm
and
impulsive
<EOS>
that
I
fear
his
heart
will
bring
him
into
trouble
.
<EOS>
now
,
you
know
,
unless
Frank
marry
money
he
be
lose
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
make
no
answer
to
this
last
appeal
,
but
as
he
sit
and
listen
a
slight
frown
come
across
his
brow
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
must
marry
money
,
doctor
.
<EOS>
now
we
have
,
you
see
,
with
your
assistance
,
contrive
to
separate
him
from
dear
Mary

"
with
my
assistance

Lady
Arabella

<EOS>
I
have
give
no
assistance
,
nor
have
I
meddle
in
the
matter
;
nor
will
i.
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
doctor
,
perhaps
not
meddle
;
but
you
agree
with
me
,
you
know
,
that
the
two
young
people
have
be
imprudent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
agree
to
no
such
thing
,
Lady
Arabella
;
never
,
never
.
<EOS>
I
not
only
never
agree
that
Mary
have
be
imprudent
,
but
I
will
not
agree
to
it
now
,
and
will
not
allow
any
one
to
assert
it
in
my
presence
without
contradict
it
:
"
and
then
the
doctor
work
away
at
the
thigh
-
bone
in
a
manner
that
do
rather
alarm
her
ladyship
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
any
rate
,
you
think
that
the
young
people
have
better
be
keep
apart
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
neither
do
I
think
that
:
my
niece

I
feel
sure
,
be
safe
from
danger
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
she
would
do
nothing
that
would
bring
either
her
or
me
to
shame

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
to

the
lady
,
apologetically
,
as
it
be

use
the
word
perhaps
not
exactly
in
the
doctor
's
sense
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
no
alarm
for
her

"
continue
the
doctor
,
"
and
desire
no
change
.
<EOS>
Frank
be
your
son
,
and
it
be
for
you
to
look
to
him

<EOS>
You
think
proper
to
do
so
by
desire
Mary
to
absent
herself
from
Greshamsbury
.

<EOS>
"
oh
,
no

no

no
!

say
Lady
Arabella

but
you
do
,
Lady
Arabella
;

as
Greshamsbury
be
your
home
,
neither
I
nor
my
niece
have
any
ground
of
complaint
.
<EOS>
We
acquiesce
,
not
without
much
suffering

we
do
acquiesce

you
,
I

can
have
no
ground
of
complaint
against
us

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
have
hardly
expect
that
the
doctor
would
reply
to
her
mild
and
conciliatory
exordium
with
so
much
sternness
.
<EOS>
He
have
yield
so
easily
to
her
on
the
former
occasion
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
comprehend
that
when
she
utter
her
sentence
of
exile
against
Mary
,
she
have
give
an
order
which
she
have
the
power
of
enforce
;
but
that
obedience
to
that
order
have
now
place
Mary
altogether
beyond
her
jurisdiction
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
therefore
,
a
little
surprised
,
and
for
a
few
moment
overawe
by
the
doctor
's
manner
;
but
she
soon
recover
herself
,
remember
,
doubtless
,
that
fortune
favour
none
but
the
brave
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
make
no
complaint
,
Dr
Thorne
,
"
she
say
,
after
assume
a
tone
more
befitting
a
de
Courcy
than
that
hitherto
use
,
"
I
make
no
complaint
either
as
regard
you
or
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
kind
,
Lady
Arabella
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
think
that
it
be
my
duty
to
put
a
stop
,
a
peremptory
stop
to
anything
like
a
love
affair
between
my
son
and
your
niece
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
least
objection
in
life
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
such
a
love
affair
,
put
a
stop
to
it
 
that
is
,
if
you
have
the
power
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
the
doctor
be
doubtless
imprudent
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
begin
to
think
that
he
have
yield
sufficiently
to
the
lady
;
and
he
have
begin
to
resolve
,
also
,
that
though
it
would
not
become
him
to
encourage
even
the
idea
of
such
a
marriage
,
he
would
make
Lady
Arabella
understand
that
he
think
his
niece
quite
good
enough
for
her
son
,
and
that
the
match
,
if
regard
as
imprudent
,
be
to
be
regard
as
equally
imprudent
on
both
side
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
suffer
that
Mary
and
her
heart
and
feeling
and
interest
should
be
altogether
postpone
to
those
of
the
young
heir
;
and
,
perhaps
,
he
be
unconsciously
encourage
in
this
determination
by
the
reflection
that
Mary
herself
may
perhaps
become
a
young
heiress
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
duty
,
"
say
Lady
Arabella
,
repeat
her
word
with
even
a
strong
de
Courcy
intonation
;
"

your
duty
also

Dr
Thorne

"
My

<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
,
pray
understand
at
once

that
I
repudiate
any
such
duty
,

will
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it

<EOS>

you
do
not

you
will
encourage

unfortunate

<EOS>
"
the

up

if
some
neighbour

wife
should
come
and
so
speak
to
him
?
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
what
he
would
say
:
he
would
quietly
beg
her
to
go
back
to
her
own
home
and
meddle
only
with
her
own
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
dreadful
to
Lady
Arabella
.
<EOS>
even
Dr
Thorne
have
never
before
dare
thus
to
lower
her
to
the
level
of
common
humanity
,
and
liken
her
to
any
other
wife
in
the
country
-
side
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
she
be
not
quite
sure
whether
he
,
the
parish
doctor
,
be
not
desire
her
,
the
earl
's
daughter
,
to
go
home
and
mind
her
own
business
.
<EOS>
on
this
first
point
,
however
,
there
seem
to
be
no
room
for
doubt
,
of
which
she
give
herself
the
benefit
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
not

with

on

I
can
only
repeat

nothing

,
therefore
,
I
have
call
on
you
to
say
that
I
think
it
be
imprudent

should
be
so
much
together

the

tell

I

Mary
be

as
I
do
not
disapprove
of
your

as
an
acquaintance
for
her
,

rather
,
on
the
other
hand

regard
with
pleasure
their
friendship

you
can
not
expect
that
I
should
take
any
step
to
put
an
end
to
it

<EOS>

but
suppose
it
should
lead
to
renew
intercourse
between
Frank

Mary

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
objection

<EOS>
Frank
be
a

I

badly

suffer
very
greatly
from
imputation

most
unjustly
throw

<EOS>
It
be

however

your

Lady

have
by
this

perceive
that

be
not
destine
on

gain
any
great
victory

<EOS>
She
,
however
,
be
angry
as
well
as
the
doctor

<EOS>
It
be
not
the
man
's
vehemence
that
provoke
her
so
much

his
evident
determination

break
down
the
prestige

her
rank

place
her
on
a
footing
in
no
respect
superior
to
his

He
have
never

be
so
audaciously
arrogant

move

certainly

say
he

fully
understand

bow
low

open
first
the
study

door

then
the
front
-
door
,
then
the
garden

gate

<EOS>
and
then
Lady
Arabella
stalk
off
,
not
without
full
observation
from
Mrs
Yates
Umbleby

her
friend
Miss
Gushing
,
who
live
close
by

<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
go
on
a
visit
 
and
now
begin
the
unpleasant
thing
at
Greshamsbury
of
which
we
have
here
tell
.
<EOS>
when
Lady
Arabella
walk
away
from
the
doctor
's
house
she
resolve
that
,
let
it
cost
what
it
may
,
there
should
be
war
to
the
knife
between
her
and
him
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
insult
by
him
 
so
at
least
she
say
to
herself
,
and
so
she
be
prepared
to
say
to
other
also
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
not
to
be
bear
that
a
de
Courcy
should
allow
her
parish
doctor
to
insult
her
with
impunity
.
<EOS>
She
would
tell
her
husband
with
all
the
dignity
that
she
could
assume
,
that
it
have
now
become
absolutely
necessary
that
he
should
protect
his
wife
by
break
entirely
with
his
unmannered
neighbour
;
and
,
as
regard
the
young
member
of
her
family
,
she
would
use
the
authority
of
a
mother
,
and
absolutely
forbid
them
to
hold
any
intercourse
with
Mary
Thorne

<EOS>
so
resolve
,
she
walk
quickly
back
to
her
own
house

<EOS>
the
doctor
,
when
leave
alone
,
be
not
quite
satisfied
with
the
part
he
have
take
in
the
interview
.
<EOS>
He
have
speak
from
impulse
rather
than
from
judgement
,
and
,
as
be
generally
the
case
with
man
who
do
so
speak
,
he
have
afterwards
to
acknowledge
to
himself
that
he
have
be
imprudent
.
<EOS>
He
accuse
himself
probably
of
more
violence
than
he
have
really
use
,
and
be
therefore
unhappy
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
his
indignation
be
not
at
rest
.
<EOS>
He
be
angry
with
himself
;
but
not
on
that
account
the
less
angry
with
Lady
Arabella
.
<EOS>
She
be
cruel
,
overbearing
,
and
unreasonable
;
cruel
in
the
most
cruel
of
manner
,
so
he
think
;
but
not
on
that
account
be
he
justify
in
forget
the
forbearance
due
from
a
gentleman
to

lady
.
<EOS>
Mary
,
moreover
,
have
owe
much
to
the
kindness
of
this
woman
,
and
,
therefore
,
Dr
Thorne
feel
that
he
should
have
forgive
much
.
  
<EOS>
thus
the
doctor
walk
about
his
room
,
much
disturbed
;
now
accuse
himself
for
have
be
so
angry
with
Lady
Arabella
,
and
then
feed
his
own
anger
by
think
of
her
misconduct
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
immediate
conclusion
at
which
he
resolve
be
this
,
that
it
be
unnecessary
that
he
should
say
anything
to
Mary
on
the
subject
of
her
ladyship
's
visit
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
no
doubt
,
sorrow
enough
in
store
for
his
darling
;
why
should
he
aggravate
it
?
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
would
doubtless
not
stop
now
in
her
course
;
but
why
should
he
accelerate
the
evil
which
she
would
doubtless
be
able
to
effect
?
  
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
,
when
she
return
to
the
house
,
allow
no
grass
to
grow
under
her
foot
.
<EOS>
as
she
enter
the
house
she
desire
that
Miss
Beatrice
should
be
send
to
her
directly
she
return
;
and
she
desire
also
,
that
as
soon
as
the
squire
should
be
in
his
room
a
message
to
that
effect
may
be
immediately
bring
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Beatrice

she
say
,
as
soon
as
the
young

appear
before
her

and
in
speak
she
assume
her
firm
tone
of
authority
,
"
Beatrice
,
I
be
sorry
,
my

to

anything
that

unpleasant

I
must
make
it
a
positive

for
the

<EOS>
Beatrice

who

Lady

she

so

Dr

Lady

have
begin
by
exact
,

try
to
exact
a
promise

as
she
find
that
this
be
not
forthcoming
,
she
think
it
better
to
give
up
the
point
without
a
dispute

<EOS>
It
may
be
that
Beatrice
would
absolutely
refuse
to
pay
this
respect
to
her
mother
's
authority
,
and
then
where
would
she
have
be
?
  
<EOS>
at
this
moment
a
servant
come
up
to
say
that
the

be
in
his

be
opportunely

this
Beatrice

feel
convinced

while
Lady

open
her
budget
the

sit
quite
silent

listen
to
her
with
apparent
respect

She
find
it
necessary
that
her
description
to
him

be
much
more
elaborate
than
that
which
she

vouchsafe
to
her

Lady

pause
a
minute

<EOS>
the
game
which
she
now
have
to

be

easy

she

that

shuffle
out

It
behove
her

therefore

to
put

forward
in
such
a
way

they
must
be
notice

you
do
not

I
do

there
be

<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes

I
know
what
you
mean

a
wife

family
be
expensive

I
ask

no

he
do
not

ask

occasion
urge
on

the
heinousness

that
at

"
well

then

be
make

hope
that

will
assist
me
in
prevent
this

he
not
only
tell
me
that
he
mean
to
encourage
Mary
in
her
plan

positively
insult
me
to
my
face

laugh
at
me
for
be
an
earl
's
daughter

tell
me
 
yes

absolutely
tell
me
 
to
get
out
of
his
house

"
  
<EOS>
let
it
be
tell
with
some
shame
as
to
the
squire
's
conduct
,
that
his
first
feeling
on
hear
this
be
one
of
envy
 
of
envy
and
regret
that
he
could
not
make
the
same
uncivil
request
.
<EOS>
not
that
he
wish
to
turn
his
wife
absolutely
out
of
his
house
;
but
he
would
have
be
very
glad
to
have
have
the
power
of
dismiss
her
summarily
from
his
own
room
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
at
present
impossible
;
so
he
be
oblige
to
make
some
mild
reply

have
mistake

well

my

I
can
not

this
be
true

for
the
squire
could
hardly
have
quarrel
with
Dr

,
even
have
he
wish
it

then
I
think
it
right
to
tell
you

I
shall

,
Mr

I
do
not
expect
much
co

operation
from
you

I
do
think

have
show
some
little
anger

ill

all
our
Greshamsbury
friend
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
well
for
the
squire
to
declare
that
he
would
not
quarrel
with
Dr
Thorne
,
and
of
course
he
do
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
but
he
,
himself
,
have
no
wish
whatever
that
his
son
should
marry
Mary
Thorne
;
and
as
a
fall
drop
will
hollow
a
stone
,
so
do
the
continual
harping
of
his
wife
on
the
subject
give
rise
to
some
amount
of
suspicion
in
his
own
mind
.
<EOS>
then
as
to
Beatrice
,
though
she
have
make
no
promise
that
she
would
not
again
visit
Mary
,
she
be
by
no
mean
prepared
to
set
her
mother
's
authority
altogether
at
defiance
;
and
she
also
be
sufficiently
uncomfortable
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
say
nothing
of
the
matter
to
his
niece
,
and
she
,
therefore
,
would
have
be
absolutely
bewilder
by
Beatrice
's
absence
,
have
she
not
receive
some
tiding
of
what
have
take
place
at
Greshamsbury
through
Patience
Oriel
.
<EOS>
Beatrice
and
Patience
discuss
the
matter
fully
,
and
it
be
agree
between
them
that
it
would
be
well
that
Mary
should
know
what
sterner
order
respect
her
have
go
forth
from
the
tyrant
at
Greshamsbury
,
and
that
she
may
understand
that
Beatrice
's
absence
be
compulsory
.
<EOS>
patience
be
thus
place
in
this
position
,
that
on
one
day
she
walk
and
talk
with
Beatrice
,
and
on
the
next
with
Mary
;
and
so
matter
go
on
for
a
while
at
Greshamsbury
 
not
very
pleasantly
.
  
<EOS>
very
unpleasantly
and
very
uncomfortably
do
the
month
of
May
and
June
pass
away
.
<EOS>
Beatrice
and
Mary
occasionally
meet
,
drink
tea
together
at
the
parsonage
,
or
in
some
other
of
the
ordinary
meeting
of
country
society
;
but
there
be
no
more
confidentially
distress
confidential
discourse
,
no
more
whispering
of
Frank
's
name
,
no
more
sweet
allusion
to
the
inexpediency
of
a
passion
,
which
,
accord
to
Beatrice
's
view
,
would
have
be
so
delightful
have
it
be
expedient
.
  
<EOS>
the
squire
and
the
doctor
also
meet
constantly
;
there
be
unfortunately
many
subject
on
which
they
be
oblige
to
meet
.
<EOS>
Louis
Philippe
 
or
Sir
Louis
as
we
must
call
him
 
though
he
have
no
power
over
his
own
property
,
be
wide
awake
to
all
the
come
privilege
of
ownership
,
and
he
would
constantly
point
out
to
his
guardian
the
manner
in
which
,
accord
to
his
idea
,
the
most
should
be
make
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
young
baronet
's
idea
of
good
taste
be
not
of
the
most
refined
description
,
and
he
do
not
hesitate
to
tell
Dr
Thorne
that
his
,
the
doctor
's
,
friendship
with
Mr
Gresham
must
be
no
bar
to
his
,
the
baronet
's
,
interest
.
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
also
have
his
own
lawyer
,
who
give
Dr
Thorne
to
understand
that
,
accord
to
his
idea
,
the
sum
due
on
Mr
Gresham
's
property
be
too
large
to
be
leave
on
its
present
footing
;
the
title
-
deed
,
he
say
,
should
be
surrender
or
the
mortgage
foreclose
.
<EOS>
all
this
add
to
the
sadness
which
now
seem
to
envelop
the
village
of
Greshamsbury
.
  
<EOS>
early
in
July
,
Frank
be
to
come
home
.
<EOS>
the
manner
in
which
the
coming
and
going
of
"
poor
Frank
"
be
allow
to
disturb
the
arrangement
of
all
the
lady
,
and
some
of
the
gentleman
,
of
Greshamsbury
be
most
abominable
.
<EOS>
and
yet
it
can
hardly
be
say
to
have
be
his
fault
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
be
only
too
well
pleased
have
thing
be
allow
to
go
on
after
their
old
fashion
.
<EOS>
thing
be
not
allow
so
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
at
Christmas
Miss
Oriel
have
submit
to
be
exile
,
in
order
that
she
may
carry
Mary
away
from
the
presence
of
the
young
Bashaw
,
an
arrangement
by
which
all
the
winter
festivity
of
the
poor
doctor
have
be
thoroughly
sacrifice
;
and
now
it
begin
to
be
say
that
some
similar
plan
for
the
summer
must
be
suggest
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
suppose
that
any
direction
to
this
effect
be
convey
either
to
Mary
or
to
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
the
suggestion
come
from
them
,
and
be
mention
only
to
Patience
.
<EOS>
but
Patience
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
tell
Beatrice
,
and
Beatrice
tell
her
mother
,
somewhat
triumphantly
,
hope
thereby
to
convince
the
she
-
dragon
of
Mary
's
innocence
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
she
-
dragon
be
not
easily
convince
of
the
innocence
of
any
one
.
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
quite
coincide
in
the
propriety
of
Mary
's
be
send
off
,
 
whither
<EOS>
she
never
inquire
,
 
in
order
that
the
coast
may
be
clear
for
"
poor
Frank
;
"
but
she
do
not
a
whit
the
more
abstain
from
talk
of
the
wicked
intrigue
of
those
Thornes
.
<EOS>
as
it
turn
out
,
Mary
's
absence
cause
her
to
talk
all
the
more
.
  
<EOS>
the
Boxall
Hill
property
,
include
the
house
and
furniture
,
have
be
leave
to
the
contractor
's
son
;
it
be
understand
that
the
property
would
not
be
at
present
in
his
own
hand
,
but
that
he
may
inhabit
the
house
if
he
choose
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
It
would
thus
be
necessary
for
Lady
Scatcherd
to
find
a
home
for
herself
,
unless
she
could
remain
at
Boxall
Hill
by
her
son
's
permission
.
<EOS>
in
this
position
of
affair
the
doctor
have
be
oblige
to
make
a
bargain
between
them
.
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
do
wish
to
have
the
comfort
,
or
perhaps
the
honour
,
of
a
country
house
;
but
he
do
not
wish
to
have
the
expense
of
keep
it
up
.
<EOS>
He
be
also
willing
to
let
his
mother
live
at
the
house
;
but
not
without
a
consideration
.
<EOS>
after
a
prolonged
degree
of
haggling
,
term
be
agree
upon
;
and
a
few
week
after
her
husband
's
death
,
Lady
Scatcherd
find
herself
alone
at
Boxall
Hill
 
alone
as
regard
society
in
the
ordinary
sense
,
but
not
quite
alone
as
concern
her
ladyship
,
for
the
faithful
Hannah
be
still
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
be
of
course
often
at
Boxall
Hill
,
and
never
leave
it
without
an
urgent
request
from
Lady
Scatcherd
that
he
would
bring
his
niece
over
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
now
Lady
Scatcherd
be
no
fit
companion
for
Mary
Thorne
,
and
though
Mary
have
often
ask
to
be
take
to
Boxall
Hill
,
certain
consideration
have
hitherto
induce
the
doctor
to
refuse
the
request
;
but
there
be
that
about
Lady
Scatcherd
,
 
a
kind
of
homely
honesty
of
purpose
,
an
absence
of
all
conceit
as
to
her
own
position
,
and
a
strength
of
womanly
confidence
in
the
doctor
as
her
friend
,
which
by
degree
win
upon
his
heart
.
<EOS>
when
,
therefore
,
both
he
and
Mary
feel
that
it
would
be
well
for
her
again
to
absent
herself
for
a
while
from
Greshamsbury
<EOS>
,
it
be
,
after
much
deliberation
,
agree
that
she
should
go
on
a
visit
to
Boxall
Hill
.
  
<EOS>
to
Boxall
Hill
,
accordingly
,
she
go
,
and
be
receive
almost
as
a
princess
.
<EOS>
Mary
have
all
her
life
be
accustomed
to
woman
of
rank
,
and
have
never
habituate
herself
to
feel
much
trepidation
in
the
presence
of
titled
grandee
;
but
she
have
prepare
herself
to
be
more
than
ordinarily
submissive
to
Lady
Scatcherd
.
<EOS>
Her
hostess
be
a
widow
,
be
not
a
woman
of
high
birth
,
be
a
woman
of
whom
her
uncle
speak
well
;
and
,
for
all
these
reason
,
Mary
be
determine
to
respect
her
,
and
pay
to
her
every
consideration
.
<EOS>
but
when
she
settle
down
in
the
house
she
find
it
almost
impossible
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Lady
Scatcherd
treat
her
as
a
farmer
's
wife
may
have
treat
some
convalescent
young
lady
who
have
be
send
to
her
charge
for
a
few
week
,
in
order
that
she
may
benefit
by
the
country
air
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
could
hardly
bring
herself
to
sit
still
and
eat
her
dinner
tranquilly
in
her
guest
's
presence
.
<EOS>
and
then
nothing
be
good
enough
for
Mary
.
<EOS>
Lady
Scatcherd
beseech
her
,
almost
with
tear
,
to
say
what
she
like
best
to
eat
and
drink
;
and
be
in
despair
when
Mary
declare
she
do
not
care
,
that
she
like
anything
,
and
that
she
be
in
nowise
particular
in
such
matter
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
roast
fowl
,
Miss
Thorne
?
"
  
"
very
nice
,
Lady
Scatcherd
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
bread
sauce
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
bread
sauce
 
<EOS>
yes
;
oh
,
yes
 
<EOS>
I
like
bread
sauce
,
"
 
and
poor
Mary
try
hard
to
show
a
little
interest
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
just
a
few
sausage
.
<EOS>
We
make
them
all
in
the
house
,
Miss
Thorne
;
we
know
what
they
be
.
<EOS>
and
mash
potato
 
<EOS>
do
you
like
them
<EOS>
best
mash
or
bake
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
find
herself
oblige
to
vote
,
vote
for
mashed
potato
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
.
<EOS>
but
,
Miss
Thorne
,
if
you
like
boil
fowl
better
,
with
a
little
bit
of
ham
,
you
know
,
I
do
hope
you
will
say
so
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
lamb
in
the
house
,
quite
beautiful
;
now
do
"
ee
say
something
;
do
"
ee
,
Miss
Thorne
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
invoke
,
Mary
feel
herself
oblige
to
say
something
,
and
declare
for
the
roast
fowl
and
sausage
;
but
she
find
it
very
difficult
to
pay
much
outward
respect
to
a
person
who
would
pay
so
much
outward
respect
to
her
.
<EOS>
a
day
or
two
after
her
arrival
it
be
decide
that
she
should
ride
about
the
place
on
a
donkey
;
she
be
accustomed
to
ride
,
the
doctor
have
generally
take
care
<EOS>
that
one
of
his
own
horse
should
,
when
require
,
consent
to
carry
a
lady
;
but
there
be
no
steed
at
Boxall
Hill
that
she
could
mount
;
and
when
Lady
Scatcherd
have
offer
to
get
a
pony
for
her
,
she
have
willingly
compromise
matter
by
express
the
delight
she
would
have
in
make
a
campaign
on
a
donkey
.
<EOS>
upon
this
,
Lady
Scatcherd
have
herself
set
off
in
quest
of
the
desire
animal
,
much
to
Mary
's
horror
;
and
do
not
return
till
the
necessary
purchase
have
be
effect
.
<EOS>
then
she
come
back
with
the
donkey
close
at
her
heel
,
almost
hold
its
collar
,
and
stand
there
at
the
hall
-
door
till
Mary
come
to
approve
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
will
do
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
she
will
kick
,
"
say
Lady
Scatcherd
,
pat
the
head
of
her
purchase
quite
triumphantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
you
be
so
kind
,
Lady
Scatcherd
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
she
will
do
quite
nicely
;
she
seem
very
quiet
,
"
say
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
please
,
my
lady
,
it
be
a
he
,
"
say
the
boy
who
hold
the
halter
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
<EOS>
a
he
,
be
it
?
"
say
her
ladyship
;
"
but
the
he
-
donkey
be
quite
as
quiet
as
the
she
s
,
be
not
they
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
my
lady
;
a
deal
quieter
,
all
the
world
over
,
and
twice
as
useful

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
of
that
,
Miss
Thorne

"
say
Lady
Scatcherd
,
her
eye
bright
with
joy
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
Mary
be
establish
with
her
donkey
,
who
do
all
that
could
be
expect
from
an
animal
in
his
position

<EOS>
"
but
,
dear
Lady
Scatcherd

"
say
Mary
,
as
they
sit
together
at
the
open

room
window
the
same
evening
,
"
you

<EOS>
and
she
come
and
knelt
at
Lady
Scatcherd

foot

and
take
hold
of
her
,
look
up
into
her
face

<EOS>
Lady
Scatcherd
's
cheek
become
rather
red

as
though
she
be
somewhat
ashamed
of
her
position

<EOS>
"
You
be
so
very
kind
to

continue
Mary

it
seem
so
cold

well

Miss

I
be

only
I

<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
never
mind
,
let
me
alone
.
<EOS>
but
what
I
want
to
say
be
this
:
do
you
think
I
could
drop
it
?
<EOS>
Hannah
say
,
that
if
I
go
the
right
way
about
it
she
be
sure
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
but
,
Lady
Scatcherd
,
you
should
not
think
of
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Should
not
I
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
;
for
your
husband
's
sake
you
should
be
proud
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
gain
great
honour
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
well
,
"
say
she
,
sigh
after
a
short
pause
;
"
if
you
think
it
will
do
him
any
good
,
of
course
I
will
put
up
with
it
.
<EOS>
and
then
I
know
Louis
would
be
mad
if
I
talk
of
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
but
,
Miss
Thorne
,
dear
,
a
woman
like
me
do
not
like
to
have
to
be
make
a
fool
of
all
the
day
of
her
life
if
she
can
help
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Lady
Scatcherd
,
"
say
Mary
,
when
this
question
of
the
title
have
be
duly
settle
,
and
her
ladyship
make
to
understand
that
she
must
bear
the
burden
for
the
rest
of
her
life
,
"
but
,
Lady
Scatcherd
,
you
be
speak
of
Sir
Roger
's
sister
;
what
become
of
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
she
do
very
well
at
last
,
as
Sir
Roger
do
himself
;
but
in
early
life
she
be
very
unfortunate
 
just
at
the
time
of
my
marriage
with
dear
Roger
 
,
"
and
then
,
just
as
she
be
about
to
commence
so
much
as
she
know
of
the
history
of
Mary
Scatcherd
,
she
remember
that
the
author
of
her
sister
-
in
-
law
's
misery
have
be
a
Thorne
,
a
brother
of
the
doctor
;
and
,
therefore
,
as
she
presume
,
a
relative
of
her
guest
;
and
suddenly
she
become
mute
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Mary
;
"
just
as
you
be
married
,
Lady
Scatcherd
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Lady
Scatcherd
have
very
little
worldly
knowledge
,
and
do
not
in
the
least
know
how
to
turn
the
conversation
or
escape
from
the
trouble
into
which
she
have
fall
.
<EOS>
all
manner
of
reflection
begin
to
crowd
upon
her
.
<EOS>
in
her
early
day
she
have
know
very
little
of
the
Thornes
,
nor
have
she
think
much
of
them
since
,
except
as
regard
her
friend
the
doctor
;
but
at
this
moment
she
begin
for
the
first
time
to
remember
that
she
have
never
hear
of
more
than
two
brother
in
the
family
.
<EOS>
who
then
could
have
be
Mary
's
father
?
<EOS>
She
feel
at
once
that
it
would
be
improper
for
to
say
anything
as
to
Henry
Thorne
's
terrible
fault
and
sudden
fate
;
 
improper
also
,
to
say
more
about
Mary
Scatcherd
;
but
she
be
quite
unable
to
drop
the
matter
otherwise
than
abruptly
,
and
with
a
start
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
very
unfortunate
,
you
say
,
Lady
Scatcherd
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
Miss
Thorne
;
Mary
,
I
mean
 
never
mind
me
 
<EOS>
I
shall
do
it
in
time
.
<EOS>
yes
,
she
be
;
but
now
I
think
of
it
<EOS>
,
I
have
better
say
nothing
more
about
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
reason
,
and
I
ought
not
to
have
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
be
provoke
with
me
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
assure
her
that
she
would
not
be
provoke
,
and
of
course
ask
no
more
question
about
Mary
Scatcherd
;
nor
do
she
think
much
more
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
so
however
with
her
ladyship
,
who
could
not
keep
herself
from
reflect
that
the
old
clergyman
in
the
close
at
Barchester
certainly
have
but
two
son
,
one
of
whom
be
now
the
doctor
at
Greshamsbury
,
and
the
other
of
whom
have
perish
so
wretchedly
at
the
gate
of
that
farmyard
.
<EOS>
who
then
be
the
father
of
Mary
Thorne
?
  
<EOS>
the
day
pass
very
quietly
at
Boxall
Hill
.
<EOS>
every
morning
Mary
go
out
on
her
donkey
,
who
justify
by
his
demeanour
all
that
have
be
say
in
his
praise
;
then
she
would
read
or
draw
,
then
walk
with
Lady
Scatcherd
,
then
dine
,
then
walk
again
;
and
so
the
day
pass
quietly
away
.
<EOS>
once
or
twice
a
week
the
doctor
would
come
over
and
drink
his
tea
there
,
ride
home
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Mary
also
receive
one
visit
from
her
friend
Patience
.
  
<EOS>
so
the
day
pass
quietly
away
till
the
tranquillity
of
the
house
be
suddenly
break
by
tiding
from
London
.
<EOS>
Lady
Scatcherd
receive
a
letter
from
her
son
,
contain
in
three
line
,
in
which
he
intimate
that
on
the
follow
day
he
mean
to
honour
her
with
a
visit
.
<EOS>
He
have
intend
,
he
say
,
to
have
go
to
Brighton
with
some
friend
;
but
as
he
feel
himself
a
little
out
of
sort
,
he
would
postpone
his
marine
trip
and
do
his
mother
the
grace
of
spend
a
few
day
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
this
news
be
not
very
pleasant
to
Mary
,
by
whom
it
have
be
understand
,
as
it
have
also
by
her
uncle
,
that
Lady
Scatcherd
would
have
have
the
house
to
herself
;
but
as
there
be
no
means
of
prevent
the
evil
,
Mary
could
only
inform
the
doctor
,
and
prepare
herself
to
meet
Sir
Louis
Scatcherd
.
   
<EOS>
the
Doctor
Hears
Something
to
His
advantage
 
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
Scatcherd
have
tell
his
mother
that
he
be
rather
out
of
sort
,
and
when
he
reach
Boxall
Hill
it
certainly
do
not
appear
that
he
have
give
any
exaggerated
statement
of
his
own
malady
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
be
a
good
deal
out
of
sort
.
<EOS>
He
have
have
more
than
one
attack
of
delirium
tremen
since
his
father
's
death
,
and
have
almost
be
at
death
's
door
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
have
be
say
about
this
by
Dr
Thorne
at
Boxall
Hill
;
but
he
be
by
no
means
ignorant
of
his
ward
's
state
.
<EOS>
twice
he
have
go
up
to
London
to
visit
him
;
twice
he
have
beg
him
to
go
down
into
the
country
and
place
himself
under
his
mother
's
care
.
<EOS>
on
the
last
occasion
,
the
doctor
have
threaten
him
with
all
manner
of
pain
and
penalty
:
with
pain
,
as
to
his
speedy
departure
from
this
world
and
all
its
joy
;
and
with
penalty
,
in
the
shape
of
poverty
if
that
departure
should
by
any
chance
be
retard
.
<EOS>
but
these
threat
have
at
the
moment
be
in
vain
,
and
the
doctor
have
compromise
matter
by
induce
Sir
Louis
to
promise
that
he
would
go
to
Brighton
.
<EOS>
the
baronet
,
however
,
who
be
at
length
frighten
by
some
renew
attack
,
give
up
his
Brighton
scheme
,
and
,
without
any
notice
to
the
doctor
,
hurry
down
to
Boxall
Hill
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
do
not
see
him
on
the
first
day
of
his
coming
,
but
the
doctor
do
.
<EOS>
He
receive
such
intimation
of
the
visit
as
enable
him
to
be
at
the
house
soon
after
the
young
man
's
arrival
;
and
,
know
that
his
assistance
may
be
necessary
,
he
ride
over
to
Boxall
Hill
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
dreadful
task
to
him
,
this
of
make
the
same
fruitless
endeavour
for
the
son
that
he
have
make
for
the
father
,
and
in
the
same
house
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
bind
by
every
consideration
to
perform
the
task
.
<EOS>
He
have
promise
the
father
that
he
would
do
for
the
son
all
that
be
in
his
power
;
and
he
have
,
moreover
,
the
consciousness
,
that
should
Sir
Louis
succeed
in
destroy
himself
,
<EOS>
the
next
heir
to
all
the
property
be
his
own
niece
,
Mary
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
He
find
Sir
Louis
in
a
low
,
wretched
,
miserable
state
.
<EOS>
though
he
be
a
drunkard
as
his
father
be
,
he
be
not
at
all
such
a
drunkard
as
be
his
father
.
<EOS>
the
physical
capacity
of
the
man
be
very
different
.
<EOS>
the
daily
amount
of
alcohol
which
the
father
have
consume
would
have
burn
up
the
son
in
a
week
;
whereas
,
though
the
son
be
continually
tipsy
,
what
he
swallow
would
hardly
have
have
an
injurious
effect
upon
the
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
all
wrong
,
quite
wrong
,
"
say
Sir
Louis
,
petulantly
;
"
it
be
not
that
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
have
take
nothing
this
week
past
 
literally
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
the
liver
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
want
no
one
to
tell
him
what
be
the
matter
with
his
ward
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
liver
;
his
liver
,
and
his
head
,
and
his
stomach
,
and
his
heart
.
<EOS>
every
organ
in
his
body
have
be
destroy
,
or
be
in
the
course
of
destruction
.
<EOS>
His
father
have
kill
himself
with
brandy
;
the
son
,
more
elevated
in
his
taste
,
be
do
the
same
thing
with
curaçoa
,
maraschino
,
and
cherry
-
bounce
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Louis
,
"
say
the
doctor
 
<EOS>
he
be
oblige
to
be
much
more
punctilious
with
him
than
he
have
be
with
the
contractor
 
<EOS>
"
the
matter
be
in
your
own
hand
entirely
:
if
you
can
not
keep
your
lip
from
that
accursed
poison
,
you
have
nothing
in
this
world
to
look
forward
to
;
nothing
,
nothing
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
propose
to
return
with
her
uncle
to
Greshamsbury
,
and
he
be
at
first
well
inclined
that
she
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
but
this
idea
be
overrule
,
partly
in
compliance
with
Lady
Scatcherd
's
entreaty
,
and
partly
because
it
would
have
seem
as
though
they
have
both
think
the
presence
of
its
owner
have
make
the
house
an
unfit
habitation
for
decent
people
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
therefore
return
,
leave
Mary
there
;
and
Lady
Scatcherd
busy
herself
between
her
two
guest
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
next
day
Sir
Louis
be
able
to
come
down
to
a
late
dinner
,
and
Mary
be
introduce
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
dress
himself
in
his
good
array
;
and
as
he
have
 
at
any
rate
for
the
present
moment
 
be
frighten
out
of
his
libation
,
he
be
prepared
to
make
himself
as
agreeable
as
possible
.
<EOS>
His
mother
wait
on
him
almost
as
a
slave
may
have
do
;
but
she
seem
to
do
so
with
the
fear
of
a
slave
rather
than
the
love
of
a
mother
.
<EOS>
She
be
fidgety
in
her
attention
,
and
worry
him
by
endeavour
to
make
her
evening
sit
-
room
agreeable
.
  
<EOS>
but
Sir
Louis
,
though
he
be
not
very
sweetly
behave
under
these
manipulation
from
his
mother
's
hand
,
be
quite
complaisant
to
Miss
Thorne
;
nay
,
after
the
expiration
of
a
week
he
be
almost
more
than
complaisant
.
<EOS>
He
pique
himself
on
his
gallantry
,
and
now
find
that
,
in
the
otherwise
dull
seclusion
of
Boxall
Hill
,
he
have
a
good
opportunity
of
exercise
it
.
<EOS>
to
do
him
justice
it
must
be
admit
that
he
would
not
have
be
incapable
of
a
decent
career
<EOS>
have
he
stumble
upon
some
girl
who
could
have
love
him
before
he
stumble
upon
his
maraschino
bottle
.
<EOS>
such
may
have
be
the
case
with
many
a
lost
rake
.
<EOS>
the
thing
that
be
bad
be
accept
because
the
thing
that
be
good
do
not
come
easily
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
how
many
a
miserable
father
revile
with
bitterness
of
spirit
the
low
taste
of
his
son
,
who
have
do
nothing
to
provide
his
child
with
high
pleasure
!
  
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
 
partly
in
the
hope
of
Mary
's
smile
,
and
partly
frighten
by
the
doctor
's
threat
 
<EOS>
do
,
for
a
while
,
keep
himself
within
decent
bound
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
usually
appear
before
Mary
's
eye
till
three
or
four
in
the
afternoon
;
but
when
he
do
come
forth
,
he
come
forth
sober
and
resolute
to
please
.
<EOS>
His
mother
be
delighted
,
and
be
not
slow
to
sing
his
praise
;
and
even
the
doctor
,
who
now
visit
Boxall
Hill
more
frequently
than
ever
,
begin
to
have
some
hope
.
  
<EOS>
one
constant
subject
,
I
must
not
say
of
conversation
,
on
the
part
of
Lady
Scatcherd
,
but
rather
of
declamation
,
have
hitherto
be
the
beauty
and
manly
attribute
of
Frank
Gresham
.
<EOS>
She
have
hardly
cease
to
talk
to
Mary
of
the
infinite
good
quality
of
the
young
squire
,
and
especially
of
his
prowess
in
the
matter
of
Mr
Moffat
.
<EOS>
Mary
have
listen
to
all
this
eloquence
,
not
perhaps
with
inattention
,
but
without
much
reply
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
be
exactly
sorry
to
hear
Frank
talk
about
;
indeed
,
have
she
be
so
minded
,
she
could
herself
have
say
something
on
the
same
subject
;
but
she
do
not
wish
to
take
Lady
Scatcherd
altogether
into
her
confidence
,
and
she
have
be
unable
to
say
much
about
Frank
Gresham
without
do
so
.
<EOS>
Lady
Scatcherd
have
,
therefore
,
gradually
conceive
the
idea
that
her
darling
be
not
a
favourite
with
her
guest
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
therefore
,
she
change
the
subject
;
and
,
as
her
own
son
be
behave
with
such
unexampled
propriety
,
she
drop
Frank
and
confine
her
eulogy
to
Louis
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
a
little
wild
<EOS>
,
she
admit
;
young
man
so
often
be
so
;
but
she
hope
that
it
be
now
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
do
still
take
a
little
drop
of
those
french
drink
in
the
morning
,
"
say
Lady
Scatcherd
,
in
her
confidence
;
for
she
be
too
honest
to
be
false
,
even
in
her
own
cause
.
<EOS>
"
He
do
do
that
,
I
know
:
but
that
be
nothing
,
my
dear
,
to
swill
all
day
;
and
everything
can
not
be
do
at
once
,
can
it
,
Miss
Thorne
?
"
  
<EOS>
on
this
subject
Mary
find
her
tongue
loosen
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
talk
about
Frank
Gresham
,
but
she
could
speak
with
hope
to
the
mother
of
her
only
son
.
<EOS>
She
could
say
that
Sir
Louis
be
still
very
young
;
that
there
be
reason
to
trust
that
he
may
now
reform
;
that
his
present
conduct
be
apparently
good
;
and
that
he
appear
capable
of
well
thing
.
<EOS>
so
much
she
do
say
;
and
the
mother
take
her
sympathy
for
more
than
it
be
worth
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
matter
,
and
on
this
matter
perhaps
alone
,
Sir
Louis
and
Lady
Scatcherd
be
in
accord
.
<EOS>
there
be
much
to
recommend
Mary
to
the
baronet
;
not
only
do
he
see
her
to
be
beautiful
,
and
perceive
her
to
be
attractive
and
ladylike
;
but
she
be
also
the
niece
of
the
man
who
,
for
the
present
,
hold
the
purse
-
string
of
his
wealth
.
<EOS>
Mary
,
it
be
true
,
have
no
fortune
.
<EOS>
but
Sir
Louis
know
that
she
be
acknowledge
to
be
a
lady
;
and
he
be
ambitious
that
his
"
lady
"
should
be
a
lady
.
<EOS>
there
be
also
much
to
recommend
Mary
to
the
mother
,
to
any
mother
;
and
thus
it
come
to
pass
,
that
Miss
Thorne
have
no
obstacle
between
her
and
the
dignity
of
be
Lady
<EOS>
Scatcherd
the
second
;
 
no
obstacle
<EOS>
whatever
,
if
only
she
could
bring
herself
to
wish
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
some
time
 
two
or
three
week
,
perhaps
 
before
Mary
's
mind
be
first
open
to
this
new
brilliancy
in
her
prospect
.
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
at
first
be
rather
afraid
of
her
,
and
do
not
declare
his
admiration
in
any
very
determined
term
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
pay
her
many
compliment
which
,
from
any
one
else
,
she
would
have
regard
as
abominable
.
<EOS>
but
she
do
not
expect
great
thing
from
the
baronet
's
taste
:
she
conclude
that
he
be
only
do
what
he
think
a
gentleman
should
do
;
and
she
be
willing
to
forgive
much
for
Lady
Scatcherd
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
His
first
attempt
be
,
perhaps
,
more
ludicrous
than
passionate
.
<EOS>
He
be
still
too
much
an
invalid
to
take
walk
,
and
Mary
be
therefore
save
from
his
company
in
her
ramble
;
but
he
have
a
horse
of
his
own
at
Boxall
Hill
,
and
have
be
advise
to
ride
by
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
Mary
also
ride
 
on
a
donkey
<EOS>
only
,
it
be
true
 
<EOS>
but
Sir
Louis
find
himself
bind
in
gallantry
to
accompany
her
.
<EOS>
Mary
's
steed
have
answer
every
expectation
,
and
prove
himself
very
quiet
;
so
quiet
,
that
without
the
admonition
of
a
cudgel
behind
him
,
he
could
hardly
be
persuade
into
the
demure
trot
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
Sir
Louis
's
horse
be
of
a
very
different
mettle
,
he
find
it
rather
difficult
not
to
step
faster
than
his
inamorata
;
and
,
let
it
him
struggle
as
he
would
,
be
generally
so
far
ahead
as
to
be
debar
the
delight
of
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
when
for
the
second
time
he
propose
to
accompany
her
,
Mary
do
what
she
could
to
hinder
it
.
<EOS>
She
see
that
he
have
be
rather
ashamed
of
the
manner
in
which
his
companion
be
mount
,
and
she
herself
would
have
enjoy
her
ride
much
more
without
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
an
invalid
,
however
;
it
be
necessary
to
make
much
of
him
,
and
Mary
do
not
absolutely
refuse
his
offer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Scatcherd
,
"
say
he
,
as
they
be
stand
at
the
door
previous
to
mount
 
<EOS>
he
always
call
his
mother
Lady
Scatcherd
 
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
you
have
a
horse
for
Miss
Thorne
?
<EOS>
this
donkey
be
 
be
 
<EOS>
really
be
,
so
very
 
very
 
can
not
go
at
all
,
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Scatcherd
begin
to
declare
that
she
would
willingly
have
get
a
pony
if
Mary
would
have
let
her
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
Lady
Scatcherd
;
not
on
any
account
.
<EOS>
I
do
like
the
donkey
so
much
 
<EOS>
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
he
will
not
go
,
"
say
Sir
Louis
.
<EOS>
"
and
for
a
person
who
ride
like
you
,
Miss
Thorne
 
<EOS>
such
a
horsewoman
you
know
 
<EOS>
why
,
you
know
,
Lady
Scatcherd
,
it
be
positively
ridiculous
;
d
 
---
<EOS>
absurd
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
,
with
an
angry
look
at
his
mother
,
he
mount
his
horse
,
and
be
soon
lead
the
way
down
the
avenue
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Thorne
,
"
say
he
,
pull
himself
up
at
the
gate
,
"
if
I
have
know
that
I
be
to
be
so
extremely
happy
as
to
have
find
you
here
,
I
would
have
bring
you
down
the
most
beautiful
creature
,
an
Arab
.
<EOS>
She
belong
to
my
friend
Jenkins
;
but
I
would
not
have
stand
at
any
price
in
get
her
for
you
.
<EOS>
by
Jove
!
<EOS>
if
you
be
on
that
mare
,
I
would
back
you
,
for
style
and
appearance
,
against
anything
in
Hyde
Park
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
offer
of
this
sporting
wager
,
which
naturally
would
have
be
very
gratify
to
Mary
,
be
lose
upon
her
,
for
Sir
Louis
have
again
unwittingly
get
on
in
advance
,
but
he
stop
himself
in
time
to
hear
Mary
again
declare
her
passion
be
a
donkey
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
could
only
see
Jenkins
's
little
mare
,
Miss
Thorne
!
<EOS>
only
say
one
word
,
and
she
shall
be
down
here
before
the
week
's
end
.
<EOS>
price
shall
be
no
obstacle
 
<EOS>
none
whatever
.
<EOS>
by
Jove
,
what
a
pair
you
would
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
this
generous
offer
be
repeat
four
or
five
time
;
but
on
each
occasion
Mary
only
half
hear
what
be
say
,
and
on
each
occasion
the
baronet
be
far
too
much
in
advance
to
hear
Mary
's
reply
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
recollect
that
he
want
to
call
on
one
of
the
tenant
,
and
beg
his
companion
to
allow
him
to
ride
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
at
all
dislike
be
leave
alone
,
you
know
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
<EOS>
no
,
not
at
all
,
Sir
Louis
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
used
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
I
do
not
care
about
it
,
you
know
;
only
I
can
not
make
this
horse
walk
the
same
pace
as
that
brute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
abuse
my
pet
,
Sir
Louis
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
d
 
---
shame
on
my
mother
's
part
;
"
say
Sir
Louis
,
who
,
even
when
in
his
good
behaviour
,
could
not
quite
give
up
his
ordinary
mode
of
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
when
she
be
fortunate
enough
to
get
such
a
girl
as
you
to
come
and
stay
with
her
,
she
ought
to
have
have
something
proper
for
her
to
ride
upon
;
but
I
will
look
to
it
as
soon
as
I
be
a
little
strong
<EOS>
,
you
see
if
I
do
not
;
"
and
,
so
say
,
Sir
Louis
trot
off
,
leave
Mary
in
peace
with
her
donkey
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
have
now
be
live
cleanly
and
forswear
sack
for
what
be
to
him
a
very
long
period
,
and
his
health
feel
the
good
effect
of
it
.
<EOS>
no
one
rejoice
at
this
more
cordially
than
do
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
to
rejoice
at
it
be
with
him
a
point
of
conscience
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
help
tell
himself
now
and
again
that
,
circumstance
as
he
be
,
he
be
most
specially
bind
to
take
joy
in
any
sign
of
reformation
which
the
baronet
may
show
.
<EOS>
not
to
do
so
would
be
almost
tantamount
to
wish
that
he
may
die
in
order
that
Mary
may
inherit
his
wealth
;
and
,
therefore
,
the
doctor
do
with
all
his
energy
devote
himself
to
the
difficult
task
of
hope
and
strive
that
Sir
Louis
may
yet
live
to
enjoy
what
be
his
own
.
<EOS>
but
the
task
be
altogether
a
difficult
one
,
for
as
Sir
Louis
become
strong
in
health
,
so
also
do
he
become
more
exorbitant
in
his
demand
on
the
doctor
's
patience
,
and
more
repugnant
to
the
doctor
's
taste
.
  
<EOS>
in
his
bad
fit
of
disreputable
living
he
be
ashamed
to
apply
to
his
guardian
for
money
;
and
in
his
bad
fit
of
illness
he
be
,
through
fear
,
somewhat
patient
under
his
doctor
's
hand
;
but
just
at
present
he
have
nothing
of
which
to
be
ashamed
,
and
be
not
at
all
patient
.
  
<EOS>
"
doctor
,
"
 
say
he
,
one
day
,
at
Boxall
Hill
 
"
how
about

oh
 
ah
 
yes

no

the
lawyer
will
settle
it
:
settle
it
with

I

how

Doctor
Thorne

money

should

I
will

something

the

open
his

try
to
look

something

as
the

something

well

I

so

what
would
you
think

get
marry

<EOS>
"
I
should
be
delighted

more
delighted

I
can
express
;
that
is
,
of

if
you
be
to
marry
well

<EOS>
It
be
your

most
eager
wish

you
should
marry
early

<EOS>
"
that
be
partly
my

<EOS>
but
then
,
if
I
marry
I
must
have
an
income
fit
to
live
on

eh

doctor

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
have
some
fear
that
his
interesting
protégée
be
desirous
of
a
wife
for
the
sake
of
the
income
,
instead
of
desire
the
income
for
the
sake
of
the
wife
.
<EOS>
but
let
the
cause
be
what
it
would
,
marriage
would
probably
be
good
for
him
;
and
he
have
no
hesitation
,
therefore
,
in
tell
him
,
that
if
he
marry
well
,
he
should
be
put
in
possession
of
sufficient
income
to
maintain
the
new
Lady

manner

her
dignity

you
think
of
Miss
Mary
Thorne

<EOS>
It
must
be
say
in
Sir

favour
that
he
have
probably
no

such

He
have
no

almost
too
precious

infinitely
beyond

ten
thousand
a
year
,
and
such
coin
usually
current
in
the
world
's
market
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
rich
man
and
a
baronet
,
and
Mary
be
an
unmarried
girl
without
a
portion
.
<EOS>
in
Sir
Louis
's
estimation
he
be
offer
everything
,
and
ask
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
have
some
idea
that
girl
be
apt
to
be
coy
,
and
require
a
little
wooing
in
the
shape
of
present
,
civil
speech
 
perhaps
kiss
also
.
<EOS>
the
civil
speech
he
have
,
he
think
,
do
,
and
imagine
that
they
have
be
well
receive
.
<EOS>
the
other
thing
be
to
follow
;
an
arab
pony
,
for
instance
,
 
and
the
kiss
probably
with
it
;
and
then
all
these
difficulty
would
be
smooth
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
for
a
moment
conceive
that
there
would
be
any
difficulty
with
the
uncle
.
<EOS>
how
should
there
be
?
<EOS>
be
he
not
a
baronet
with
ten
thousand
a
year
come
to
him
?
<EOS>
have
he
not
everything
which
father
want
for
portionless
daughter
,
and
uncle
for
dependant
niece
?
<EOS>
may
he
not
well
inform
the
doctor
that
he
have
something
to
tell
him
for
his
advantage
?
  
<EOS>
and
yet
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
the
doctor
do
not
seem
to
be
overjoy
when
the
announcement
be
first
make
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
by
no
mean
overjoy
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
even
Sir
Louis
could
perceive
his
guardian
's
surprise
be
altogether
unmixed
with
delight
.
  
<EOS>
what
a
question
be
this
that
be
ask
him
!
<EOS>
what
would
he
think
of
a
marriage
between
Mary
Thorne
 
<EOS>
his
Mary
and
Sir
Louis
Scatcherd
?
<EOS>
between
the
alpha
of
the
whole
alphabet
,
and
him
whom
he
could
not
but
regard
as
the
omega
!
<EOS>
think
of
it
!
<EOS>
why
he
would
think
of
it
as
though
a
lamb
and
a
wolf
be
to
stand
at
the
altar
together
.
<EOS>
have
Sir
Louis
be
a
Hottentot
,
or
an
Esquimaux
,
the
proposal
could
not
have
astonish
him
more
.
<EOS>
the
two
person
be
so
totally
of
a
different
class
,
that
the
idea
of
the
one
fall
in
love
with
the
other
have
never
occur
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
what
would
you
think
of
Miss
Mary
Thorne
?
"
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
have
ask
;
and
the
doctor
,
instead
of
answer
him
with
ready
and
pleased
alacrity
,
stand
silent
,
thunderstruck
with
amazement
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
would
not
she
be
a
good
wife
?
"
say
Sir
Louis
,
rather
in
a
tone
of
disgust
at
the
evident
disapproval
show
at
his
choice
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
would
have
be
so
delighted
.
"
  
"
Mary
Thorne
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculate
the
doctor
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
you
speak
to
my
niece
about
this
,
Sir
Louis
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
have
and
<EOS>
yet
I
have
not
;
I
have
not
,
and
yet
in
a
manner
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
you
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
see
,
I
have
not
exactly
pop
to
her
yet
;
but
I
have
be
do
the
civil
;
and
if
she
be
up
to
snuff
,
as
I
take
her
to
be
,
she
know
very
well
what
I
be
after
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
up
<EOS>
to
snuff
!
<EOS>
Mary
Thorne
,
his
Mary
Thorne
,
up
to
snuff
!
<EOS>
to
snuff
too
of
such
a
very
disagreeable
description
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Sir
Louis
,
that
you
be
in
mistake
about
this
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
will
find
that
Mary
will
not
be
dispose
to
avail
herself
of
the
great
advantage
 
for
great
<EOS>
they
undoubtedly
be
 
which
you
be
able
to
offer
to
your
intend
wife
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
take
my
advice
,
you
will
give
up
thinking
of
Mary
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
suit
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
suit
me
!
<EOS>
oh
,
but
I
think
she
just
would
.
<EOS>
She
be
get
no
money
,
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
do
not
mean
that
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
signify
to
you
whether
your
wife
have
money
or
not
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
look
for
money
.
<EOS>
but
you
should
think
of
some
one
more
nearly
of
your
own
temperament
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
sure
that
my
niece
would
refuse
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
these
last
word
the
doctor
utter
with
much
emphasis
.
<EOS>
His
intention
be
to
make
the
baronet
understand
that
the
matter
be
quite
hopeless
,
and
to
induce
him
if
possible
to
drop
it
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
know
Sir
Louis
;
he
rank
him
too
low
in
the
scale
of
human
being
,
and
give
him
no
credit
for
any
strength
of
character
.
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
in
his
way
do
love
Mary
Thorne
;
and
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
that
Mary
do
not
,
or
at
any
rate
,
would
not
soon
return
his
passion
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
moreover
,
sufficiently
obstinate
,
firm
we
ought
perhaps
to
say
,
 
for
his
pursuit
in
this
case
be
certainly
not
an
evil
one
,
 
and
he
at
once
make
up
his
mind
to
succeed
in
spite
of
the
uncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
she
consent
,
however
,
you
will
do
so
too
?
"
<EOS>
ask
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
impossible
she
should
consent
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
impossible
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
anything
at
all
impossible
.
<EOS>
but
if
she
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
she
will
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
 
that
be
to
be
see
.
<EOS>
but
just
tell
me
this
,
if
she
do
,
will
you
consent
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
star
would
fall
first
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
nonsense
.
<EOS>
give
it
up
,
my
dear
friend
;
believe
me
you
be
only
prepare
unhappiness
for
yourself
;
"
and
the
doctor
put
his
hand
kindly
on
the
young
man
's
arm
.
<EOS>
"
She
will
not
,
can
not
accept
such
an
offer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
not
!
can
not
!
"
say
the
baronet
,
think
over
all
the
reason
which
in
his
estimation
could
possibly
be
induce
the
doctor
to
be
so
hostile
to
his
view
,
and
shake
the
hand
off
his
arm
.
"
<EOS>
Will
not
!
can
not
!
<EOS>
but
come
,
doctor
,
answer
my
question
fairly
.
<EOS>
if
she
will
have
me
for
well
or
bad
,
you
will
not
say
aught
against
it
;
<EOS>
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
she
will
not
have
you
;
why
should
you
give
her
and
yourself
the
pain
of
a
refusal
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
as
for
that
,
I
must
stand
my
chance
like
another
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
her
,
why
d
 
---
,
doctor
,
you
would
not
have
me
believe
that
any
young
lady
think
it
so
very
dreadful
to
have
a
baronet
with
ten
thousand
pound
a
year
at
her
foot
,
specially
when
that
same
baronet
be
not
very
old
,
nor
yet
particularly
ugly
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
so
green
as
that
,
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
she
must
go
through
it
,
then
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
musing
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Dr
Thorne
,
I
do
look
for
a
kinder
answer
from
you
,
consider
all
that
you
so
often
say
about
your
great
friendship
with
my
father
.
<EOS>
I
do
think
you
would
at
any
rate
answer
me
when
I
ask
you
a
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
the
doctor
do
not
want
to
answer
that
special
question
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
possible
that
Mary
should
wish
to
marry
this
odious
man
,
could
such
a
state
of
thing
be
imagine
to
be
the
case
,
he
would
not
refuse
his
consent
,
infinitely
as
he
would
be
disgust
by
her
choice
.
<EOS>
but
he
would
not
give
Sir
Louis
any
excuse
for
tell
Mary
that
her
uncle
approve
of
so
odious
a
match
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
that
in
any
case
I
should
approve
of
such
a
marriage
,
Sir
Louis
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
bring
myself
to
say
so
;
for
I
know
it
would
make
you
both
miserable
.
<EOS>
but
on
that
matter
my
niece
will
choose
wholly
for
herself
.
"
  
"
and
about
the
money
,
doctor
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
marry
a
decent
woman
you
shall
not
want
the
mean
of
support
her
decently
,
"
and
so
say
the
doctor
walk
away
,
leave
Sir
Louis
to
his
meditation
.
   
<EOS>
the
Donkey
Ride
 
Sir
Louis
,
when
leave
to
himself
,
be
slightly
dismay
and
somewhat
discouraged
;
but
he
be
not
induce
to
give
up
his
object
.
<EOS>
the
first
effort
of
his
mind
be
make
in
conjecture
what
private
motive
Dr
Thorne
could
possibly
have
in
wish
to
debar
his
niece
from
marry
a
rich
young
baronet
.
<EOS>
that
the
objection
be
personal
to
himself
,
Sir
Louis
do
not
for
a
moment
imagine
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
the
doctor
do
not
wish
that
his
niece
should
be
rich
,
and
grander
,
and
altogether
big
than
himself
?
<EOS>
or
be
it
possible
that
his
guardian
be
anxious
to
prevent
him
from
marry
from
some
view
of
the
reversion
of
the
large
fortune
?
<EOS>
that
there
be
some
such
reason
,
Sir
Louis
be
well
sure
;
but
let
it
be
what
it
may
,
he
would
get
the
well
of
the
doctor
.
"
<EOS>
He
know
,
"
so
he
say
to
himself
,
"
what
stuff
girl
be
make
of
.
<EOS>
baronet
do
not
grow
like
blackberry
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
,
assure
himself
with
such
philosophy
,
he
determine
to
make
his
offer
.
  
<EOS>
the
time
he
select
for
do
this
be
the
hour
before
dinner
;
but
on
the
day
on
which
his
conversation
with
the
doctor
have
take
place
,
he
be
deter
by
the
presence
of
a
strange
visitor
.
<EOS>
to
account
for
this
strange
visit
it
will
be
necessary
that
we
should
return
to
Greshamsbury
for
a
few
minute
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
,
when
he
return
home
for
his
summer
vacation
,
find
that
Mary
have
again
fly
;
and
the
very
fact
of
her
absence
add
fuel
to
the
fire
of
his
love
,
more
perhaps
than
even
her
presence
may
have
do
.
<EOS>
for
the
flight
of
the
quarry
ever
add
eagerness
to
the
pursuit
of
the
huntsman
.
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
,
moreover
,
have
a
bitter
enemy
;
a
foe
,
utterly
opposed
to
her
side
in
the
contest
,
where
she
have
once
fondly
look
for
her
staunch
ally
.
<EOS>
Frank
be
now
in
the
habit
of
correspond
with
Miss
Dunstable
,
and
receive
from
her
most
energetic
admonition
to
be
true
to
the
love
which
he
have
swear
.
<EOS>
true
to
it
he
resolve
to
be
;
and
therefore
,
when
he
find
that
Mary
be
fly
,
he
resolve
to
fly
after
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
,
however
,
do
this
till
he
have
be
in
a
measure
provoke
to
it
by
it
by
the
sharp
-
tongued
caution
and
blunt
irony
of
his
mother
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
enough
for
her
that
she
have
banish
Mary
out
of
the
parish
,
and
make
Dr
Thorne
's
life
miserable
;
not
enough
that
she
harass
her
husband
with
harangue
on
the
constant
subject
of
Frank
's
marry
money
,
and
dismay
Beatrice
with
invective
against
the
iniquity
of
her
friend
.
<EOS>
the
snake
be
so
but
scotch
;
to
kill
it
outright
she
must
induce
Frank
utterly
to
renounce
Miss
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
this
task
she
essay
,
but
not
exactly
with
success
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
mother
,
"
say
Frank
,
at
last
turn
very
red
,
partly
with
shame
,
and
partly
with
indignation
,
as
he
make
the
frank
avowal
,
"
since
you
press
me
about
it
,
I
tell
you
fairly
that

up

later

continue

to
his
mother
's
interjection

if
she
will
consent

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
consent
!
"
say
Lady
Arabella

<EOS>
"
oh

and
fall
into
the
corner
of
the
sofa

she
bury
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes

and
now
that
I
have
tell
you
so
much

it
be
only
just
that
I
should
tell
you
this
also
;
that
as
far
as
I
can
see
at
present
I
have
no
reason

hope
that
she
will
do
so

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Frank
,
the
girl
be
do
all
she
can
to
catch
you

say
Lady
Arabella

not
prudently

"
no

mother

there
you
wrong
her
altogether

wrong
her
most
cruelly

You
ungracious

wicked

I
do
not

you
cruel

you

cruelly

most
cruelly

when

speak
to
her
about
this

I
have
speak

she

behave
exactly

I

She
have
give
me
no

You
have
turn

out
among

<EOS>
Frank
be
begin
to
be
very
bitter
now

she
have
do
nothing
to
deserve
it

<EOS>
if
there
have
be
any
fault
it

mine

it
be
well
that

My
intention
be

so
speak

certainly
without

filial
respect

he
turn
towards
the
door

Frank

say
his

up

energy

one
last
appeal

You

open

You

marry
money

then
Lady
Arabella
stand
up
before
her
son
as
Lady
Macbeth
may
have
stand
,
have
Lady
Macbeth
live
to
have
a

"
Miss
Dunstable

I
suppose
,
"
say
Frank
,
scornfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
mother

I
make
an
ass
,

bad
than
an
ass
of
myself
once
in

way

I
will
not
do
it
again

<EOS>
I
hate
money

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Frank
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
money

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
,
Frank
,
the
estate
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
the
estate
 
<EOS>
at
least
I
shall
hate
it
if
I
be
expect
to
buy
it
at
such
a
price
as
that

<EOS>
the
estate
be
my

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
Frank
;
it
be
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
in
the
sense
I
mean
.
<EOS>
He
may
do
with
it
as
he
please
;
he
will
never
have
a
word
of
complaint
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
ready
to
go
into
a
profession
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
a
lawyer
,

a
doctor

an
engineer
;
I
do
not
care
what
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Frank
,
in
his
enthusiasm
,
probably
overlook
some
of
the
preliminary
difficulty
.
<EOS>
"
or
I
will
take
a
farm
under
him
,
and
earn
my
bread
that
way

,
mother
,
do
not
talk
to

any
more
about
marry
money

<EOS>
and
,
so
say
,
Frank
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
,
it
will
be
remember
,
be
twenty
-
one
when
he
be
first
introduce
to
the
reader
;
he
be
now
twenty
-
two
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
say
that
there
be
a
great
difference
between
his
character
then
and
now
.
<EOS>
a
year
at
that
period
will
make
a
great
difference
;
but
the
change
have
be
,
not
in
his
character
,
but
in
his
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
go
out
from
his
mother
and
immediately
order
his
black
horse
to
be
get
ready
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
at
once
go
over
to
Boxall
Hill
.
<EOS>
He
go
himself
to
the
stable
to
give
his
order
;
and
as
he
return
to
get
his
glove
and
whip
<EOS>
he
meet
Beatrice
in
the
corridor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Beatrice
,
"
say
he
,
"
step
in
here
,
"
and
she
follow
him
into
his
room
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
go
to
bear
this
any
longer
;
I
be
go
to
Boxall
Hill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Frank
!
<EOS>
how
can
you
be
so
imprudent
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
,
at
any
rate
,
have
some
decent
feeling
for
Mary
.
<EOS>
I
believe
you
have
some
regard
for
her
;
and
therefore
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Will
you
send
her
any
message
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
;
my
good
,
good
love
;
that
be
if
you
will
see
her
;
but
,
Frank
,
you
be
very
foolish
,
very
;
and
she
will
be
infinitely
distressed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
mention
this
,
that
is
,
not
at
present
;
not
that
I
mean
to
make
any
secret
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
tell
my
father
everything
.
<EOS>
I
be
off
now
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
pay
no
attention
to
her
remonstrance
,
he
turn
down
the
stair
and
be
soon
on
horseback
.
  
<EOS>
He
take
the
road
to
Boxall
Hill
,
but
he
do
not
ride
very
fast
:
he
do
not
go
jauntily
as
a
jolly
,
thrive
wooer
;
but
musingly
,
and
often
with
diffidence
,
meditate
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
whether
it
would
not
be
well
for
him
to
turn
back
:
to
turn
back
 
but
not
from
fear
of
his
mother
;
not
from
prudential
motive
;
not
because
that
often
-
repeat
lesson
as
to
marry
money
be
begin
to
take
effect
;
not
from
such
cause
as
these
;
but
because
he
doubt
how
he
may
be
receive
by
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
,
it
be
true
,
think
something
about
his
worldly
prospect
.
<EOS>
He
have
talk
rather
grandiloquently
to
his
mother
as
to
his
hate
money
,
and
hate
the
estate
.
<EOS>
His
mother
's
never
-
cease
worldly
care
on
such
subject
perhaps
demand
that
a
little
grandiloquence
should
be
oppose
to
them
.
<EOS>
but
Frank
do
not
hate
the
estate
;
nor
do
he
at
all
hate
the
position
of
an
english
country
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Miss
Dunstable
's
eloquence
,
however
,
rang
in
his
ear
.
<EOS>
for
Miss
Dunstable
have
an
eloquence
of
her
own
,
even
in
her
letter
.
<EOS>
"
never
let
them
talk
you
out
of
your
own
true
,
honest
,
hearty
feeling
,
"
she
have
say
.
<EOS>
"
Greshamsbury
be
a
very
nice
place
,
I
be
sure
;
and
I
hope
I
shall
see
it
some
day
;
but
all
its
green
knoll
be
not
half
so
nice
,
should
not
be
half
so
precious
,
as
the
pulse
of
your
own
heart
.
<EOS>
that
be
your
own
estate
,
your
own
,
your
very
own
 
<EOS>
your
own
and
another
be
;
<EOS>
whatever
may
go
to
the
money
-
lender
,
do
not
send
that
there
.
<EOS>
do
not
mortgage
that
,
Mr
Gresham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Frank
,
pluckily
,
as
he
put
his
horse
into
a
fast
trot
,
"
I
will
not
mortgage
that
.
<EOS>
They
may
do
what
they
like
with
the
estate
;
but
my
heart
's
my
own
,
"
and
so
speak
to
himself
,
almost
aloud
,
he
turn
a
corner
of
the
road
rapidly
and
come
at
once
upon
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
hallo
,
doctor
!
<EOS>
be
that
you
?
"
<EOS>
say
Frank
,
rather
disgusted
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
Frank
!
<EOS>
I
hardly
expect
to
meet
you
here
,
"
say
Dr
Thorne
,
not
much
better
pleased
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
now
not
above
a
mile
from
Boxall
Hill
,
and
the
doctor
,
therefore
,
could
not
but
surmise
whither
Frank
be
go
.
<EOS>
They
have
repeatedly
meet
since
Frank
's
return
from
Cambridge
,
both
in
the
village
and
in
the
doctor
's
house
;
but
not
a
word
have
be
say
between
them
about
Mary
beyond
what
the
mere
courtesy
have
require
.
<EOS>
not
that
each
do
not
love
the
other
sufficiently
to
make
a
full
confidence
between
them
desirable
to
both
;
but
neither
have
have
the
courage
to
speak
out
.
  
<EOS>
nor
have
either
of
them
the
courage
to
do
so
now
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Frank
,
blush
,
"
I
be
go
to
Lady
Scatcherd
's
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
find
the
lady
at
home
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
Lady
Scatcherd
be
there
;
but
Sir
Louis
be
there
also
 
an
invalid
:
perhaps
you
would
not
wish
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
I
do
not
mind
,
"
say
Frank
,
try
to
laugh
;
"
he
will
not
bite
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
long
in
his
heart
to
pray
to
Frank
to
return
with
him
;
not
to
go
and
make
further
mischief
;
not
to
do
that
which
may
cause
a
more
bitter
estrangement
between
himself
and
the
squire
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
not
the
courage
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bring
himself
to
accuse
Frank
of
be
in
love
with
his
niece
.
<EOS>
so
after
a
few
more
senseless
word
on
either
side
,
word
which
each
know
to
be
senseless
as
he
utter
them
,
they
both
ride
on
their
own
way
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
the
doctor
silently
,
and
almost
unconsciously
,
make
such
a
comparison
between
Louis
Scatcherd
and
Frank
Gresham
as
Hamlet
make
between
the
dead
and
live
king
.
<EOS>
It
be
Hyperion
to
a
satyr
.
<EOS>
be
it
not
as
impossible
that
Mary
should
not
love
the
one
,
as
that
she
should
love
the
other
?
<EOS>
Frank
's
offer
of
his
affection
have
at
first
probably
be
but
a
boyish
ebullition
of
feeling
;
but
if
it
should
now
be
,
that
this
have
grow
into
a
manly
and
disintereste
love
,
how
could
Mary
remain
unmoved
?
<EOS>
what
could
her
heart
want
more
,
well
,
more
beautiful
,
more
rich
than
such
a
love
as
his
?
<EOS>
be
he
not
personally
all
that
a
girl
could
like
?
<EOS>
be
not
his
disposition
,
mind
,
character
,
acquirement
,
all
such
as
woman
most
delight
to
love
?
<EOS>
be
it
not
impossible
that
Mary
should
be
indifferent
to
him
?
  
<EOS>
so
meditate
the
doctor
as
he
ride
along
,
with
only
too
true
a
knowledge
of
human
nature
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
it
be
impossible
,
it
be
quite
impossible
that
Mary
should
be
indifferent
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
be
indifferent
since
Frank
have
utter
his
first
half
-
joke
word
of
love
.
<EOS>
such
thing
be
more
important
to
woman
than
they
be
to
man
,
to
girl
than
they
be
to
boy
.
<EOS>
when
Frank
have
first
tell
her
that
he
love
her
;
aye
,
month
before
that
,
when
he
merely
look
his
love
,
her
heart
have
receive
the
whisper
,
have
acknowledge
the
glance
,
unconscious
as
she
be
herself
,
and
resolve
as
she
be
to
rebuke
his
advance
.
<EOS>
when
,
in
her
hearing
,
he
have
say
soft
nothing
to
Patience
Oriel
,
a
hate
,
irrepressible
tear
have
gather
in
her
eye
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
press
in
his
warm
,
love
grasp
the
hand
which
she
have
offer
him
as
a
token
of
mere
friendship
,
her
heart
have
forgive
him
the
treachery
,
nay
,
almost
thank
him
for
it
,
before
her
eye
or
her
word
have
be
ready
to
rebuke
him
.
<EOS>
when
the
rumour
of
his
liaison
with
Miss
Dunstable
reach
her
ear
,
when
she
hear
of
Miss
Dunstable
's
fortune
,
she
have
weep
,
weep
outright
,
in
her
chamber
 
<EOS>
weep
,
as
she
say
to
herself
,
to
think
that
he
should
be
so
mercenary
;
but
she
have
weep
,
as
she
should
have
say
to
herself
,
at
find
that
he
be
so
faithless
.
<EOS>
then
,
when
she
know
at
last
that
this
rumour
be
false
,
when
she
find
that
she
be
banish
from
Greshamsbury
for
his
sake
,
when
she
be
force
to
retreat
with
her
friend
Patience
,
how
could
she
but
love
him
,
in
that
he
be
not
mercenary
?
<EOS>
how
could
she
not
love
him
in
that
he
be
so
faithful
?
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
that
she
should
not
love
him
.
<EOS>
be
he
not
the
bright
and
the
good
of
man
that
she
have
ever
see
,
or
be
like
to
see
?
 
<EOS>
that
she
could
possibly
ever
see
,
she
would
have
say
to
herself
,
could
she
have
bring
herself
to
own
the
truth
?
<EOS>
and
then
,
when
she
hear
how
true
he
be
,
how
he
persist
against
father
,
mother
,
and
sister
<EOS>
,
how
could
it
be
that
that
should
not
be
a
merit
in
her
eye
which
be
so
great
a
fault
in
theirs
?
<EOS>
when
Beatrice
,
with
would
-
be
solemn
face
,
but
with
eye
beam
with
feminine
affection
,
would
gravely
talk
of
Frank
's
tender
love
as
a
terrible
misfortune
,
as
a
misfortune
to
them
all
,
to
Mary
herself
as
well
as
other
,
how
could
Mary
do
other
than
love
him
?
<EOS>
"
Beatrice
be
his
sister
,
"
she
would
say
within
her
own
mind
,
"
otherwise
she
would
never
talk
like
this
;
be
she
not
his
sister
,
she
could
not
but
know
the
value
of
such
love
as
this
.
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
yes
;
Mary
do
love
him
;
love
him
with
all
the
strength
of
her
heart
;
and
the
strength
of
her
heart
be
very
great
.
<EOS>
and
now
by
degree
,
in
those
lonely
donkey
-
ride
at
Boxall
Hill
,
in
those
solitary
walk
,
she
be
begin
to
own
to
herself
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
that
she
do
own
it
,
what
should
be
her
course
?
<EOS>
what
should
she
do
<EOS>
,
how
should
she
act
if
this
love
one
persevere
in
his
love
?
<EOS>
and
,
ah
!
<EOS>
what
should
she
do
<EOS>
,
how
should
she
act
if
he
do
not
persevere
?
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
there
should
be
happiness
in
store
for
her
?
<EOS>
be
it
not
too
clear
that
,
let
the
matter
go
how
it
would
,
there
be
no
happiness
in
store
for
her
?
<EOS>
much
as
she
may
love
Frank
Gresham
,
she
could
never
consent
to
be
his
wife
unless
the
squire
would
smile
on
her
as
his
daughter
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
the
squire
have
be
all
that
be
kind
,
all
that
be
affectionate
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
too
,
Lady
Arabella
!
<EOS>
as
she
think
of
the
Lady
Arabella
a
sterner
form
of
thought
come
across
her
brow
.
<EOS>
why
should
Lady
Arabella
rob
her
of
her
heart
's
joy
?
<EOS>
what
be
Lady
Arabella
that
she
,
Mary
Thorne
,
need
quail
before
her
?
<EOS>
have
Lady
Arabella
stand
only
in
her
way
,
Lady
Arabella
,
flank
by
the
de
Courcy
legion
<EOS>
,
Mary
feel
that
she
could
have
demand
Frank
's
hand
as
her
own
before
them
all
without
a
blush
of
shame
or
a
moment
's
hesitation
.
<EOS>
thus
,
when
her
heart
be
all
but
ready
to
collapse
within
her
,
would
she
gain
some
little
strength
by
think
of
the
Lady
Arabella
.
  
<EOS>
"
please
,
my
lady
,
here

young
squoire
Gresham

"
say
one
of
the
untutored

Boxall

down

almost
in

she
put
her

up
to
wipe
away
a
tear

<EOS>
"
yes

Frank
,
gently
try
to
disengage

not

You

"
  
<EOS>
by
degree
,
slow
degree

Frank
manage
to
change
the
conversation
,
and
to
induce
Lady
Scatcherd
to
speak
on
some
other
topic
than
his
own
infantine
perfection

<EOS>
He
affect
an
indifference
as
he
speak
of
her
guest
,
which
would
have
deceive
no

but
Lady
Scatcherd

then

ask
where

<EOS>
"
She
be
just
go
out
on

donkey
 
somewhere
about
the
place

<EOS>
She
ride
on
a
donkey
mostly
every
day

<EOS>
but
you
will
stop
and
take
a
bit
of
dinner
with
us
?
<EOS>
eh
,
now
do
"
ee
,
Master
Frank

"
  
<EOS>
but
Master
Frank
excuse
himself
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
choose
to
pledge
himself
to
sit
down
to
dinner
with
Mary
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
in
what
mood
they
may
return
with
regard
to
each
other
at
dinner
-
time
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
therefore
,
that
he
would
walk
out
and
,
if
possible
,
find
Miss
Thorne
;
and
that
he
would
return
to
the
house
again
before
he
go
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Scatcherd
then
begin
make
apology
for
Sir
Louis
.
<EOS>
He
be
an
invalid
;
the
doctor
have
be
with
him
all
the
morning
,
and
he
be
not
yet
out
of
his
room
.
  
<EOS>
these
apology
Frank
willingly
accept
,
and
then
make
his
way
as
he
could
on
to
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
a
gardener
,
of
whom
he
inquire
,
offer
to
go
with
him
in
pursuit
of
Miss
Thorne
.
<EOS>
this
assistance
,
however
,
he
decline
,
and
set
forth
in
quest
of
her
,
have
learn
what
be
her
most
usual
haunt
.
<EOS>
nor
be
he
direct
wrongly
;
for
after
walk
about
twenty
minute
,
he
see
through
the
tree
the
leg
of
a
donkey
move
on
the
green
-
sward
,
at
about
two
hundred
yard
from
him
.
<EOS>
on
that
donkey
doubtless
sit
Mary
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
the
donkey
be
come
towards
him
;
not
exactly
in
a
straight
line
,
but
so
much
so
as
to
make
it
impossible
that
Mary
should
not
see
him
if
he
stand
still
.
<EOS>
He
do
stand
still
,
and
soon
emerge
from
the
tree
,
Mary
see
him
all
but
close
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Her
heart
give
a
leap
within
her
,
but
she
be
so
far
mistress
of
herself
as
to
repress
any
visible
sign
of
outward
emotion
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
fall
from
her
donkey
,
or
scream
,
or
burst
into
tear
.
<EOS>
She
merely
utter
the
word
,
"
Mr
Gresham
!
"
<EOS>
in
a
tone
of
not
unnatural
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
he
,
try
to
laugh
,
but
less
successful
than
she
have
be
in
suppress
a
show
of
feeling
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Gresham
!
<EOS>
I
have
come
over
at
last
to
pay
my
respect
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
think
me
very
uncourteous
not
to
do
so
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
she
deny
.
<EOS>
"
She
have
not
,
"
she
say
,
"
think
him
at
all
uncivil
.
<EOS>
She
have
come
to
Boxall
Hill
to
be
out
of
the
way
;
and
,
of
course
,
have
not
expect
any
such
formality
.
<EOS>
"
as
she
utter
this
she
almost
blush
at
the
abrupt
truth
of
what
she
be
say
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
take
so
much
unaware
that
she
do
not
know
how
to
make
the
truth
other
than
abrupt
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
be
out
of
the
way
!
"
say
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
why
should
you
want
to
be
out
of
the
way
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
there
be
reason
,
"
say
she
,
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
have
quarrel
dreadfully
with
my
uncle
.
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
at
the
present
moment
have
not
about
him
a
scrap
of
badinage
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
a
single
easy
word
at
his
command
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
answer
her
with
anything
in
guise
of
a
joke
;
so
he
walk
on
,
not
answer
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
all
my
friend
at
Greshamsbury
be
well
,
"
say
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
be
Beatrice
quite
well
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
quite
well
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
Patience
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
,
Miss
Oriel
;
yes
,
I
believe
so
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
her
this
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
be
it
that
Mary
feel
a
little
flush
of
joy
,
as
Frank
speak
in
this
indifferent
way
about
Miss
Oriel
's
health
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
be
always
a
particular
friend
of
yours
,
"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
who
?
<EOS>
Miss
Oriel
?
<EOS>
so
she
be
!
<EOS>
I
like
her
amazingly
;
so
do
Beatrice
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
walk
about
six
step
in
silence
,
pluck
up
courage
for
the
great
attempt
.
<EOS>
He
do
pluck
up
his
courage
and
then
rush
at
once
to
the
attack
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
!
"
say
he
,
and
as
he
speak
he
put
his
hand
on
the
donkey
's
neck
,
and
look
tenderly
into
her
face
.
<EOS>
He
look
tenderly
,
and
,
as
Mary
's
ear
at
once
tell
her
,
his
voice
sound
more
soft
than
it
have
ever
sound
before
.
"
<EOS>
Mary
,
do
you
remember
the
last
time
that
we
be
together
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
do
remember
it
well
.
<EOS>
It
be
on
that
occasion
when
he
have
treacherously
hold
her
hand
;
on
that
day
when
,
accord
to
law
,
he
have
become
a
man
;
when
he
have
outrage
all
the
propriety
of
the
de
Courcy
interest
by
offer
his
love
to
Mary
in
Augusta
's
hearing
.
<EOS>
Mary
do
remember
it
well
;
but
how
be
she
to
speak
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
It
be
your
birthday
,
I
think
,
"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
it
be
my
birthday
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
you
remember
what
I
say
to
you
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
that
you
be
very
foolish
,
Mr
Gresham
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
I
have
come
to
repeat
my
folly
;
 
that
is
,
if
it
be
folly
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
then
that
I
love
you
,
and
I
dare
say
that
I
do
so
awkwardly
,
like
a
boy
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
may
be
just
as
awkward
now
;
but
you
ought
at
any
rate
to
believe
me
when
you
find
that
a
year
have
not
alter
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
do
not
think
him
at
all
awkward
,
and
she
do
believe
him
.
<EOS>
but
how
be
she
to
answer
him
?
<EOS>
She
have
not
yet
teach
herself
what
answer
she
ought
to
make
if
he
persist
in
his
suit
.
<EOS>
She
have
hitherto
be
content
to
run
away
from
him
;
but
she
have
do
so
because
she
would
not
submit
to
be
accuse
of
the
indelicacy
of
put
herself
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
She
have
rebuke
him
when
he
first
speak
of
his
love
;
but
she
have
do
so
because
she
look
on
what
he
say
as
a
boy
's
nonsense
.
<EOS>
She
have
school
herself
in
obedience
to
the
Greshamsbury
doctrine
.
<EOS>
be
there
any
real
reason
,
any
reason
found
on
truth
and
honesty
,
why
she
should
not
be
a
fitting
wife
to
Frank
Gresham
,
 
Francis
Newbold
Gresham
,
of
Greshamsbury
,
though
he
be
,
or
be
to
be
?
  
<EOS>
He
be
well
bear
 
as
well
bear
as
any
gentleman
in
England
.
<EOS>
She
be
basely
bear
 
as
basely
bear
as
any
lady
could
be
.
<EOS>
be
this
sufficient
bar
against
such
a
match
?
<EOS>
Mary
feel
in
her
heart
that
some
twelvemonth
since
,
before
she
know
what
little
she
do
now
know
of
her
own
story
,
she
would
have
say
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
and
would
she
indulge
her
own
love
by
inveigle
him
she
love
into
a
base
marriage
?
<EOS>
but
then
reason
speak
again
.
<EOS>
what
,
after
all
,
be
this
blood
of
which
she
have
teach
herself
to
think
so
much
?
<EOS>
Would
she
have
be
more
honest
,
more
fit
to
grace
an
honest
man
's
hearthstone
<EOS>
,
have
she
be
the
legitimate
descendant
of
a
score
of
legitimate
duchess
?
<EOS>
be
it
not
her
first
duty
to
think
of
him
 
of
what
would
make
him
happy
?
<EOS>
then
of
her
uncle
 
<EOS>
what
he
would
approve
?
<EOS>
then
of
herself
 
what
would
best
become
her
modesty
;
her
sense
of
honour
?
<EOS>
Could
it
be
well
that
she
should
sacrifice
the
happiness
of
two
person
to
a
theoretic
love
of
pure
blood
?
  
<EOS>
so
she
have
argue
within
herself
;
<EOS>
not
now
,
sit
on
the
donkey
,
with
Frank
's
hand
before
her
on
the
tame
brute
's
neck
;
but
on
other
former
occasion
as
she
have
ride
along
demurely
among
those
tree
.
<EOS>
so
she
have
argue
;
but
she
have
never
bring
her
argument
to
a
decision
.
<EOS>
all
manner
of
thought
crowd
on
her
to
prevent
her
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
would
think
of
the
squire
,
and
resolve
to
reject
Frank
;
and
would
then
remember
Lady
Arabella
,
and
resolve
to
accept
him
.
<EOS>
Her
resolution
,
however
,
be
most
irresolute
;
and
so
,
when
Frank
appear
in
person
before
her
,
carry
his
heart
in
his
hand
,
she
do
not
know
what
answer
to
make
to
him
.
<EOS>
thus
it
be
with
her
as
with
so
many
other
maiden
similarly
circumstance
;
at
last
she
leave
it
all
to
chance
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
ought
,
at
any
rate
,
to
believe
me
,
"
say
Frank
,
"
when
you
find
that
a
year
have
not
alter
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
year
should
have
teach
you
to
be
wise
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
learn
by
this
time
,
Mr
Gresham
,
that
your
lot
and
mine
be
not
cast
in
the
same
mould
;
that
our
station
in
life
be
different
.
<EOS>
Would
your
father
or
mother
approve
of
your
even
come
here
to
see
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
,
as
she
speak
these
sensible
word
,
feel
that
they
be
"
flat
,
stale
,
and
unprofitable
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
feel
,
also
,
that
they
be
not
true
in
sense
;
that
they
do
not
come
from
her
heart
;
that
they
be
not
such
as
Frank
deserve
at
her
hand
,
and
she
be
ashamed
of
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
I
hope
will
approve
of
it
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
that
my
mother
should
disapprove
of
it
be
a
misfortune
which
I
can
not
help
;
but
on
this
point
I
will
take
no
answer
from
my
father
or
mother
;
the
question
be
one
too
personal
to
myself
.
<EOS>
Mary
,
if
you
say
that
you
will
not
,
or
can
not
return
my
love
,
I
will
go
away
;
 
not
from
here
only
,
but
from
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
My
presence
shall
not
banish
you
from
all
that
you
hold
dear
.
<EOS>
if
you
can
honestly
say
that
I
be
nothing
to
you
,
can
be
nothing
to
you
,
I
will
then
tell
my
mother
that

the

thus
would

he
look
all

sure
that

finally
be
overcome

<EOS>
poor

<EOS>
the

upon

She

only
to

there

Could
the

she

her
indifference

<EOS>
as

she

nothing

She
bite

She

somewhat

do

get
over

He
involuntarily
desert

very
fast
to
Sir

Sir

do
not
once
look
at

walk
back
towards

house
with
Mr

sulky
enough
in
temper

but
still
make
some
effort
to
do
the
fine
gentleman

<EOS>
Mary
,
glad
to
be
leave
alone

merely
occupy
herself
with
sit
on

when

find

go
towards

for

for

follow

Frank
stay
but
three
minute
in
the
house
;
give
another
kiss
to
Lady
Scatcherd
,
get
three
in
return

and
thereby
infinitely
disgust
Sir
Louis
,
shake
hand
,
anything
but
warmly
,
with
the
young
baronet
,
and
just
feel
the
warmth
of
Mary

hand
within
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
feel
also
the
warmth
of
her
eye

last
glance

and
ride
home
a
happy
man

<EOS>
Post
Prandial
 
<EOS>
Frank
ride
home
a
happy
man
,
cheer
himself
,
as
successful
lover
do
cheer
themselves
,
with
the
brilliancy
of
his
late
exploit
:
nor
be
it
till
he
have
turn
the
corner
into
the
Greshamsbury
stable
that
he
begin
to
reflect
what
he
would
do
next
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
very
well
to
have
induce
Mary
to
allow
his
three
finger
to
lie
half
a
minute
in
her
soft
hand
;
the
have
do
so
may
certainly
be
sufficient
evidence
that
he
have
overcome
one
of
the
lion
in
his
path
;
but
it
could
hardly
be
say
that
all
his
difficulty
be
now
smooth
.
<EOS>
how
be
he
to
make
further
progress
?
  
<EOS>
to
Mary
,
also
,
the
same
idea
no
doubt
occur
 
with
many
other
.
<EOS>
but
,
then
,
it
be
not
for
Mary
to
make
any
progress
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
to
her
at
least
belong
this
passive
comfort
,
that
at
present
no
act
hostile
to
the
de
Courcy
interest
would
be
expect
from
her
.
<EOS>
all
that
she
could
do
would
be
to
tell
her
uncle
so
much
as
it
be
fit
that
he
should
know
.
<EOS>
the
do
this
would
doubtless
be
in
some
degree
difficult
;
but
it
be
not
probable
that
there
would
be
much
difference
,
much
of
anything
but
love
anxiety
for
each
other
,
between
her
and
Dr
Thorne
.
<EOS>
one
other
thing
,
indeed
,
she
must
do
;
Frank
must
be
make
to
understand
what
her
birth
have
be
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
,
"
she
say
to
herself
,
"
will
give
him
an
opportunity
of
retract
what
he
have
do
<EOS>
should
he
choose
to
avail
himself
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
he
should
have
such
opportunity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
Frank
have
more
than
this
to
do
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
Beatrice
that
he
would
make
no
secret
of
his
love
,
and
he
fully
resolve
to
be
as
good
as
his
word
.
<EOS>
to
his
father
he
owe
an
unreserved
confidence
;
and
he
be
fully
minded
to
give
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
he
know
,
altogether
out
of
the
question
that
he
should
at
once
marry
a
portionless
girl
without
his
father
's
consent
;
probably
out
of
the
question
that
he
should
do
so
even
with
it
.
<EOS>
but
he
would
,
at
any
rate
,
tell
his
father
,
and
then
decide
as
to
what
should
be
do
next
.
<EOS>
so
resolve
,
he
put
his
black
horse
into
the
stable
and
go
in
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
after
dinner
he
and
his
father
would
be
alone
.
  
<EOS>
yes
;
after
dinner
he
and
his
father
would
be
alone
.
<EOS>
He
dress
himself
hurriedly
,
for
the
dinner
-
bell
be
almost
on
the
stroke
as
he
enter
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
say
this
to
himself
once
and
again
;
but
when
the
meat
and
the
pudding
,
and
then
the
cheese
,
be
bear
away
,
as
the
decanter
be
place
before
his
father
,
and
Lady
Arabella
sip
her
one
glass
of
claret
,
and
his
sister
eat
their
portion
of
strawberry
,
his
press
anxiety
for
the
coming
interview
begin
to
wax
somewhat
dull
.
  
<EOS>
His
mother
and
sister
,
however
,
render
him
no
assistance
by
prolong
their
stay
.
<EOS>
with
unwonted
assiduity
he
press
a
second
glass
of
claret
on
his
mother
.
<EOS>
but
Lady
Arabella
be
not
only
temperate
in
her
habit
,
but
also
at
the
present
moment
very
angry
with
her
son
.
<EOS>
She
think
that
he
have
be
to
Boxall
Hill
,
and
be
only
wait
a
proper
moment
to
cross
-
question
him
sternly
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
now
she
depart
,
take
her
train
of
daughter
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
give
me
one
big
gooseberry
,
"
say
Nina
,
as
she
squeeze
herself
in
under
her
brother
's
arm
,
prior
to
make
her
retreat
.
<EOS>
Frank
would
willingly
have
give
her
a
dozen
of
the
big
,
have
she
want
them
;
but
have
get
the
one
,
she
squeeze
herself
out
again
and
scamper
off
.
  
<EOS>
the
squire
be
very
cheery
this
evening
;
from
what
cause
can
not
now
be
say
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
have
succeed
in
negotiate
a
further
loan
,
thus
temporarily
sprinkle
a
drop
of
water
over
the
ever
-
rise
dust
of
his
difficulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
well

Frank

<EOS>
Peter
tell
me

say
he
,
push
the
decanter
to
his
son
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
take
my

my

do

him
too
much

Ramble

use
for
farm

occasionally
for

do

and
then
the

happy

gay
look
,
which
have
be
only
render
more
happy
and
more
gay
by
his
assumed
anxiety
about
the
black
horse
,
give
place
to
that
heaviness
of
visage
which
acrimony
and
misfortune
have
make
so
habitual
to
him

<EOS>
"
something
to

<EOS>
any
grave
word
like
these
always
presage
some
money
difficulty
to

<EOS>
He
love
Frank
with

He
would
have
do
so
under
almost
any
circumstance
;
but
,
doubtless
,
that
love
have
be
make
more
palpable
to
himself
by
the
fact
that
Frank
have
be
a
good
son
as
regard
money
 
not
exigeant
as
be
Lady
Arabella
,
or
selfishly
reckless
as
be
his
nephew
Lord
Porlock
.
<EOS>
but
now
Frank
must
be
in
difficulty
about
money
.
<EOS>
this
be
his
first
idea
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
be
it
,
Frank
;
you
have
seldom
have
anything
to
say
that
have
not
be
pleasant
for
me
to
hear
?
"
<EOS>
and
then
the
heaviness
of
visage
again
give
way
for
a
moment
as
his
eye
fall
upon
his
son
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
to
Boxall
Hill
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
tenor
of
his
father
's
thought
be
change
in
an
instant
;
and
the
dread
of
immediate
temporary
annoyance
give
place
to
true
anxiety
for
his
son
.
<EOS>
He
,
the
squire
,
have
be
no
party
to
Mary
's
exile
from
his
own
domain
;
and
he
have
see
with
pain
that
she
have
now
a
second
time
be
drive
from
her
home
:
but
he
have
never
hitherto
question
the
expediency
of
separate
his
son
from
Mary
Thorne
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
it
become
too
necessary
 
too
necessary
through
his
own
default
 
that
Frank
should
marry
money
!
  
<EOS>
"
at
Boxall
Hill
,
Frank
!
<EOS>
have
that
be
prudent
?
<EOS>
or
,
indeed
,
have
it
be
generous
to
Miss
Thorne
,
who
have
be
drive
there
,
as
it
be
,
by
your
imprudence
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Father
,
it
be
well
that
we
should
understand
each
other
about
this

"
fill
your
glass
,
Frank
;
"
Frank
mechanically
do
as
he
be
tell
,
and
pass
the
bottle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
never
forgive
myself

I

keep
anything

<EOS>

I
believe
it

your
nature

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
fact
be
,
sir

that
I
have
make
up
my
mind
that
Mary
Thorne

be
my
wife
 
sooner

later

of
course

she
should
utterly
refuse

hitherto

utterly
refuse

I
believe
I
may
now
say
that
she
have
accept
me

"
  
<EOS>
the
squire
sip
his
claret
,
but
at
the
moment
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
quiet
,
manly
,
but
yet
modest
determination
about
his
son
that
he
have
hardly
notice
before
.
<EOS>
Frank
have
become
legally
of
age
,
legally
a
man
,
when
he
be
twenty
-
one
.
<EOS>
nature
,
it
seem
,
have
postpone
the
ceremony
till
he
be
twenty
-
two
.
<EOS>
nature
often
do
postpone
the
ceremony
even
to
a
much
late
age
;
 
sometimes
,
altogether
forget
to
accomplish
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
squire
continue
to
sip
his
claret
;
he
have
to
think
over
the
matter
a
while
before
he
could
answer
a
statement
so
deliberately
make
by
his
son
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
may
say
so
,

continue
Frank
,
with
perhaps
unnecessary
modesty
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
so
honest
that

have
she
not
intend
it

she
would
have
say
so
honestly

<EOS>
be
I
right
,
father

in
think
that
,
as

Mary

personally

you
would
not
reject
her
as
a
daughter
-
in

law
?

"
<EOS>
personally
!
"
say
the
squire
,
glad
to
have
the
subject
present
to
him
in
a
view
that
enable
him
to
speak
out
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
no
;
personally

I
should
not
object
to
her

I
love

I
do

I
have
always
like
her

like
to
see
her
about
the
house

"
  
"
I
know
what
you
would
say
,
father

<EOS>
"
this
be
rather
more
than
the
squire
know
himself
.
<EOS>
"
such
a
marriage
be
imprudent

"
  
<EOS>

more
than

no

Frank

in
the
usual

what
be
you
to
live
upon

what
would
you
do
with
your

<EOS>
Frank
catch
at
the
word

now

"
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
expect
to
marry
immediately

I
know
that
would
be
imprudent

I
be
pledge

father

I
certainly
can
not
go
back

and
now
that
I
have
tell
you
all
this
,
what
be
your
advice
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
father
again
sit
silent
,
still
sip
his
wine
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
in
his
son
that
he
could
be
ashamed
of
,
nothing
that
he
could
meet
with
anger
,
nothing
that
he
could
not
love
;
but
how
should
he
answer
him
?
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
that
the
son
have
more
in
him
than
the
father
;
this
his
mind
and
spirit
be
of
a
calibre
not
to
be
oppose
successfully
by
the
mind
and
spirit
of
the
squire
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
Mary
's
history
?
"
say
Mr
Gresham
,
at
last
;
"
the
history
of
her
birth
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
a
word
of
it
,
"
say
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
she
have
a
history
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nor
do
she
know
it
;
at
least
,
I
presume
not
.
<EOS>
but
you
should
know
it
now
.
<EOS>
and
,
Frank
,
I
will
tell
it
you
;
not
to
turn
you
from
her
 
not
with
that
object
,
though
I
think
that
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
it
should
have
that
effect
.
<EOS>
Mary
's
birth
be
not
such
as
would
become
your
wife
and
be
beneficial
to
your
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
so
,
father
,
I
should
have
know
that
sooner

<EOS>
why
be
she
bring
in
here
among
us
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
true
,
Frank

<EOS>
the
fault
be
mine
;
mine
and
your
mother

circumstance
bring
it
about
year
ago
,
when
it
never
occur
to
us
that
all
this
would
arise
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
tell
you
her
history
.
<EOS>
and
,
Frank
,
remember
this
,
though
I
tell
it
you
as
a
secret
,
a
secret
to
be
keep
from
all
the
world
but
one
,
you
be
quite
at
liberty
to
let
the
doctor
know
that
I
have
tell
you
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
shall
be
careful
to
let
him
know
myself
<EOS>
should
it
ever
be
necessary
that
he
and
I
should
speak
together
as
to
this
engagement
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
squire
then
tell
his
son
the
whole
story
of
Mary
's
birth
,
as
it
be
know
to
the
reader
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
sit
silent
,
look
very
blank
;
he
also
have
,
as
have
every
Gresham
,
a
great
love
for
his
pure
blood
.
<EOS>
He
have
say
to
his
mother
that
he
hate
money
,
that
he
hate
the
estate
;
but
he
would
have
be
very
slow
to
say
,
even
in
his
warm
opposition
to
her
,
that
he
hate
the
roll
of
the
family
pedigree
.
<EOS>
He
love
it
dearly
,
though
he
seldom
speak
of
it
;
 
as
man
of
good
family
seldom
do
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
those
possession
which
to
have
be
sufficient
.
<EOS>
a
man
have
it
need
not
boast
of
what
he
have
,
or
show
it
off
before
the
world
.
<EOS>
but
on
that
account
he
value
it
more
.
<EOS>
He
have
regard
Mary
as
a
cutting
duly
take
from
the
ullathorne
tree
;
not
,
indeed
,
as
a
graft
branch
,
full
of
flower
,
just
separate
from
the
parent
stalk
,
but
as
be
not
a
whit
the
less
truly
endow
with
the
pure
sap
of
that
venerable
trunk
.
<EOS>
when
,
therefore
,
he
hear
her
true
history
<EOS>
he
sit
awhile
dismay
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
sad
story
,
"
say
the
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sad
enough
,
"
say
Frank
,
rise
from
his
chair
and
stand
with
it
before
him
,
lean
on
the
back
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
Mary
,
poor
Mary
!
<EOS>
She
will
have
to
learn
it
some
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
so
,
Frank
;
"
and
then
there
be
again
a
few
moment
"
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
me
,
father
,
it
be
tell
too
late
.
<EOS>
It
can
now
have
no
effect
on
me
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
"
say
he
,
sigh
as
he
speak
,
but
still
relieve
himself
by
the
very
sigh
,
"
it
could
have
have
no
effect
<EOS>
have
I
learn
it
ever
so
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
tell
you
before
,
"
say
the
father
;
"
certainly
I
ought
to
have
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
be
no
good
,
"
say
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
sir
,
tell
me
this
:
who
be
Miss
Dunstable
's
parent
?
<EOS>
what
be
that
fellow
Moffat
's
family
?
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
perhaps
cruel
of
Frank
.
<EOS>
the
squire
,
however
,
make
no
answer
to
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
think
it
right
to
tell
you
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
leave
all
commentary
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
you
what
your
mother
will
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
she
think
of
Miss
Dunstable
's
birth
?
"
<EOS>
say
he
,
again
more
bitterly
than
before
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
sir
,
"
he
continue
,
after
a
further
pause
.
<EOS>
"
all
that
can
make
no
change
;
none
at
any
rate
now
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
make
my
love
less
,
even
if
it
could
have
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
nor
,
even
,
could
it
do
so
 
<EOS>
which
it
can
not
least
,
not
in
the
least
 
<EOS>
but
could
it
do
so
<EOS>
,
it
could
not
break
my
engagement
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
engage
to
Mary
Thorne
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
he
again
repeat
his
question
,
ask
for
his
father
's
advice
under
the
present
circumstance
.
<EOS>
the
conversation
be
a
very
long
one
,
as
long
as
to
disarrange
all
Lady
Arabella
's
plan
.
<EOS>
She
have
determine
to
take
her
son
most
stringently
to
task
that
very
evening
;
and
with
this
object
have
ensconce
herself
in
the
small
drawing
-
room
which
have
formerly
be
use
for
a
similar
purpose
by
the
august
countess
herself
.
<EOS>
here
she
now
sit
,
have
desire
Augusta
and
Beatrice
,
as
well
as
the
twin
,
to
beg
Frank
to
go
to
her
as
soon
as
he
should
come
out
of
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
poor
lady
!
<EOS>
there
she
wait
till
ten
o'clock
,
 
tealess
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
much
of
the
Bluebeard
about
the
squire
;
but
he
have
succeed
in
make
it
understand
through
the
household
that
he
be
not
to
be
interrupt
by
message
from
his
wife
during
the
post
-
prandial
hour
,
which
,
though
no
toper
,
he
love
so
well
.
  
<EOS>
as
a
period
of
twelve
month
will
now
have
to
be
pass
over
,
the
upshot
of
this
long
conversation
must
be
tell
in
as
few
word
as
possible
.
<EOS>
the
father
find
it
impracticable
to
talk
his
son
out
of
his
intended
marriage
;
indeed
,
he
hardly
attempt
to
do
so
by
any
direct
persuasion
.
<EOS>
He
explain
to
him
that
it
be
impossible
that
he
should
marry
at
once
,
and
suggest
that
he
,
Frank
,
be
very
young
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
marry
,
sir
,
before
you
be
one
-
and
-
twenty
,
"
say
Frank
.
<EOS>
yes
,
and
repent
before
I
be
two
-
and
-
twenty
.
<EOS>
so
do
not
say
the
squire
.
  
<EOS>
He
suggest
that
Mary
should
have
time
to
ascertain
what
would
be
her
uncle
's
wish
,
and
end
by
induce
Frank
to
promise
,
that
after
take
his
degree
in
October
he
would
go
abroad
for
some
month
,
and
that
he
would
not
indeed
return
to
Greshamsbury
till
he
be
three
-
and
-
twenty
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
may
perhaps
forget
her
,
"
say
the
father
to
himself
,
as
this
agreement
be
make
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
think
that
I
shall
forget
her
,
"
say
Frank
to
himself
at
the
same
time
;
"
but
he
do
not
know
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
Lady
Arabella
at
last
get
hold
of
her
son
<EOS>
she
find
that
the
time
for
her
preaching
be
utterly
go
by
.
<EOS>
He
tell
her
,
almost
with
_
sang
-
froid
_
,
what
his
plan
be
;
and
when
she
come
to
understand
them
,
and
to
understand
also
what
have
take
place
at
Boxall
Hill
,
she
could
not
blame
the
squire
for
what
he
have
do
.
<EOS>
She
also
say
to
herself
,
more
confidently
than
the
squire
have
do
,
that
Frank
would
quite
forget
Mary
before
the
year
be
out
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Buckish
,
"
say
she
to
herself
,
rejoicingly
,
"
be
now
with
the
ambassador
at
Paris
"
 
<EOS>
Lord
Buckish
be
her
nephew
 
"
and
with
him
Frank
will
meet
woman
that
be
really
beautiful
 
woman
of
fashion
.
<EOS>
when
with
Lord
Buckish
he
will
soon
forget
Mary
Thorne
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
not
on
this
account
do
she
change
her
resolve
to
follow
up
to
the
furth
point
her
hostility
to
the
Thornes
.
<EOS>
She
be
fully
enable
now
to
do
so
,
for
Dr
Fillgrave
be
already
reinstall
at
Greshamsbury
as
her
medical
adviser

visit
do
Frank
pay
to
Boxall
Hill
,
and
one
interview
have
he
with
Dr
Thorne
.
<EOS>
Mary
tell
him
all
she
know
of
her
own
sad
history
,
and
be
answer
only
by
a
kiss
,
 
a
kiss
absolutely
not
in
any
way
by
her
to
be
avoid
;
the
first
,
the
only
one
,
that
have
ever
yet
reach
her
lip
from
his
.
<EOS>
and
then
he
go
away
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
tell
him
all
the
story
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Frank
,
"
I
know
it
all
before
.
<EOS>
dear
Mary
,
dearest
Mary
!
<EOS>
do
not
you
,
doctor
,
teach
yourself
to
believe
that
I
shall
forget
her
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
also
he
go
his
way
from
him
 
<EOS>
go
his
way
also
from
Greshamsbury
,
and
be
absent
for
the
full
period
of
his
allot
banishment
 
twelve
month
,
namely
,
and
a
day
.
   
<EOS>
the
small
End
of
the
Wedge
 
<EOS>
Frank
Gresham
be
absent
from
Greshamsbury
twelve
month
and
a
day
:
a
day
be
always
add
to
the
period
of
such
absence
,
as
show
in
the
history
of
Lord
Bateman
and
other
noble
hero
.
<EOS>
We
need
not
detail
all
the
circumstance
of
his
banishment
,
all
the
detail
of
the
compact
that
be
make
.
<EOS>
one
detail
of
course
be
this
,
that
there
should
be
no
corresponding
;
a
point
to
which
the
squire
find
some
difficulty
in
bring
his
son
to
assent
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
suppose
that
Mary
Thorne
or
the
doctor
be
in
any
way
party
to
,
or
privy
to
these
agreement
.
<EOS>
by
no
mean
.
<EOS>
the
agreement
be
draw
out
,
and
make
,
and
sign
,
and
seal
at
Greshamsbury
,
and
be
know
of
nowhere
else
.
<EOS>
the
reader
must
not
imagine
that
Lady
Arabella
be
prepared
to
give
up
her
son
,
if
only
his
love
could
remain
constant
for
one
year
.
<EOS>
neither
do
Lady
Arabella
consent
to
any
such
arrangement
,
nor
do
the
squire
.
<EOS>
It
be
settle
rather
in
this
wise
:
that
Frank
should
be
subject
to
no
torturing
process
,
pester
to
give
no
promise
,
should
in
no
way
be
bully
about
Mary
 
that
is
,
not
at
present
 
if
he
would
go
away
for
a
year
.
<EOS>
then
,
at
the
end
of
the
year
,
the
matter
should
again
be
discuss
.
<EOS>
agree
to
this
,
Frank
take
his
departure
,
and
be
absent
as
per
agreement
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
Mary
's
fortune
immediately
after
his
departure
must
be
shortly
tell
,
and
then
we
will
again
join
some
of
our
Greshamsbury
friend
at
a
period
about
a
month
before
Frank
's
return
.
  
<EOS>
when
Sir
Louis
see
Frank
Gresham
stand
by
Mary
's
donkey
,
with
his
arm
round
Mary
's
knee
,
he
begin
to
fear
that
there
must
be
something
in
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
intend
that
very
day
to
throw
himself
at
Mary
's
foot
,
and
now
it
appear
to
his
inexperienced
eye
as
though
somebody
else
have
be
at
the
same
work
before
him
.
<EOS>
this
not
unnaturally
make
him
cross
;
so
,
after
have
sullenly
wish
the
visitor
<EOS>
good
-
bye
,
he
betake
himself
to
his
room
,
and
there
drink
curaçoa
alone
,
instead
of
come
down
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
this
he
do
for
two
or
three
day
,
and
then
,
take
heart
of
grace
,
he
remember
that
,
after
all
,
he
have
very
many
advantage
over
young
Gresham
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
he
be
a
baronet
,
and
could
make
his
wife
a
"
lady
.
"
<EOS>
in
the
next
place
,
Frank
's
father
be
alive
and
like
to
live
,
whereas
his
own
be
dead
.
<EOS>
He
possess
Boxall
Hill
in
his
own
right
,
but
his
rival
have
neither
house
nor
land
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
may
it
not
be
possible
for
him
also
to
put
his
arm
<EOS>
round
Mary
's
knee
;
 
her
knee
,
or
her
waist
,
or
,
perhaps
,
even
her
neck
?
<EOS>
faint
heart
never
win
fair
lady
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
he
would
try
.
  
<EOS>
and
he
do
try
.
<EOS>
with
what
result
,
as
regard
Mary
,
need
hardly
be
tell
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
do
not
get
nearly
so
far
as
put
his
hand
even
upon
her
knee
before
he
be
make
to
understand
that
it
"
be
no
go
,
"
as
he
graphically
describe
it
to
his
mother
.
<EOS>
He
try
once
and
again
.
<EOS>
on
the
first
time
Mary
be
very
civil
,
though
very
determined
.
<EOS>
on
the
second
,
she
be
more
determined
,
though
less
civil
;
and
then
she
tell
him
,
that
if
he
press
her
further
he
would
drive
her
from
his
mother
's
house
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
then
about
Mary
's
eye
,
a
fix
composure
round
her
mouth
,
and
an
authority
in
her
face
,
which
go
far
to
quell
him
;
and
he
do
not
press
her
again
.
  
<EOS>
He
immediately
leave
Boxall
Hill
,
and
,
return
to
London
,
have
more
violent
recourse
to
the
curaçoa
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
before
the
doctor
hear
of
him
,
and
be
oblige
to
follow
him
,
and
then
again
occur
those
frightful
scene
in
which
the
poor
wretch
have
to
expiate
,
either
in
terrible
delirium
or
more
terrible
prostration
of
spirit
,
the
vile
sin
which
his
father
have
so
early
teach
him
.
  
<EOS>
then
Mary
return
to
her
uncle
's
home
.
<EOS>
Frank
be
go
,
and
she
therefore
could
resume
her
place
at
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
yes
,
she
come
back
to
Greshamsbury
;
but
Greshamsbury
be
by
no
means
the
same
place
that
it
be
formerly
.
<EOS>
almost
all
intercourse
be
now
over
between
the
doctor
and
the
Greshamsbury
people
.
<EOS>
He
rarely
ever
see
the
squire
,
and
then
only
on
business
.
<EOS>
not
that
the
squire
have
purposely
quarrel
with
him
;
but
Dr
Thorne
himself
have
choose
that
it
should
be
so
,
since
Frank
have
openly
propose
for
his
niece
.
<EOS>
Frank
be
now
go
,
and
Lady
Arabella
be
in
arm
against
him
.
<EOS>
It
should
not
be
say
that
he
keep
up
any
intimacy
for
the
sake
of
aid
the
lover
in
their
love
.
<EOS>
no
one
should
rightfully
accuse
him
of
inveigle
the
heir
to
marry
his
niece
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
,
therefore
,
find
herself
utterly
separate
from
Beatrice
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
even
able
to
learn
what
Beatrice
would
think
,
or
do
think
,
of
the
engagement
as
it
now
stand
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
even
explain
to
her
friend
that
love
have
be
too
strong
for
her
,
and
endeavour
to
get
some
comfort
from
that
friend
's
absolution
from
her
sin
.
<EOS>
this
estrangement
be
now
carry
so
far
that
she
and
Beatrice
do
not
even
meet
on
neutral
ground
.
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
make
it
known
to
Miss
Oriel
that
her
daughter
could
not
meet
Mary
Thorne
,
even
as
stranger
meet
;
and
it
be
make
known
to
other
also
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Yates
Umbleby
,
and
her
dear
friend
Miss
Gushing
,
to
whose
charming
tea
-
party
none
of
the
Greshamsbury
lady
go
above
once
in
a
twelvemonth
,
talk
through
the
parish
of
this
distress
difficulty
.
<EOS>
They
would
have
be
so
happy
to
have
ask
dear
Mary
Thorne
,
only
the
Greshamsbury
lady
do
not
approve
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
be
thus
taboo
from
all
society
in
the
place
in
which
a
twelvemonth
since
she
have
be
,
of
all
its
denizen
,
perhaps
the
most
courted
.
<EOS>
in
those
day
,
no
bevy
of
Greshamsbury
young
lady
have
fairly
represent
the
Greshamsbury
young
ladyhood
if
Mary
Thorne
be
not
there
.
<EOS>
now
she
be
exclude
from
all
such
bevy
.
<EOS>
Patience
do
not
quarrel
with
her
,
certainly
;
 
come
to
see
her
frequently
;
 
invite
her
to
walk
;
 
invite
her
frequently
to
the
parsonage
.
<EOS>
but
Mary
be
shy
of
accede
to
such
invitation
,
and
at
last
frankly
tell
her
friend
Patience
,
that
she
would
not
again
break
bread
in
Greshamsbury
in
any
house
in
which
she
be
not
think
fit
to
meet
the
other
guest
who
habitually
resort
there
.
  
<EOS>
in
truth
,
both
the
doctor
and
his
niece
be
very
sore
,
but
they
be
of
that
temperament
that
keep
all
its
soreness
to
itself
.
<EOS>
Mary
walk
out
by
herself
boldly
,
look
at
least
as
though
she
be
indifferent
to
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
indeed
,
hardly
treat
.
<EOS>
young
lady
"
engagement
be
generally
matter
of
profound
secrecy
,
and
be
hardly
know
of
by
their
near
friend
till
marriage
be
a
thing
settle
.
<EOS>
but
all
the
world
know
of
Mary
's
engagement
within
a
month
of
that
day
on
which
she
have
neglect
to
expel
Frank
's
finger
from
her
hand
;
it
have
be
tell
openly
through
the
country
-
side
that
she
have
confess
her
love
for
the
young
squire
.
<EOS>
now
it
be
disagreeable
for
a
young
lady
to
walk
about
under
such
circumstance
,
especially
so
when
she
have
no
female
friend
to
keep
her
in
countenance
,
more
especially
so
when
the
gentleman
be
such
importance
in
the
neighbourhood
as
Frank
be
in
that
locality
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
matter
of
moment
to
every
farmer
,
and
every
farmer
's
wife
,
which
bride
Frank
should
marry
of
those
bespeak
for
him
;
Mary
,
namely
,
or
money
.
<EOS>
every
yokel
about
the
place
have
be
make
to
understand
that
,
by
some
feminine
sleight
of
hand
,
the
doctor
's
niece
have
manage
to
trap
Master
Frank
,
and
that
Master
Frank
have
be
send
out
of
the
way
so
that
he
may
,
if
yet
possible
,
break
through
the
trapping
.
<EOS>
all
this
make
life
rather
unpleasant
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
,
walk
solitary
in
the
lane
,
she
meet
that
sturdy
farmer
to
whose
daughter
she
have
in
former
day
be
so
serviceable
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
God
bless
"
ee
,
Miss
Mary
,
"
say
he
 
<EOS>
he
always
do
bid
God
bless
her
when
he
see
her
.
"
<EOS>
and
,
Miss
Mary
,
to
say
my
mind
out
freely
,
thee
be
quite
gude
enough
for
un

quite
gude

so
thee

squoire

<EOS>
"
there
may
,
perhaps
,
have
be
something
pleasant
in
the
heartiness
of
this
;
but
it
be
not
pleasant
to
have
this
heart
affair
of
her
thus
publicly
scan
and
talk
over
:
to
have
it
know
to
every
one
that
she
have
set
her
heart
on
marry
Frank
Gresham
,
and
that
all
the
Greshams
have
set
their
heart
on
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
and
yet
she
could
in
nowise
help
it
.
<EOS>
no
girl
could
have
be
more
staid
and
demure
,
less
demonstrative
and
boastful
about
her
love
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
yet
speak
freely
,
out
of
her
full
heart
,
to
one
human
being
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Frank
!
<EOS>
"
all
her
spoken
sin
have
be
contain
in
that
.
  
<EOS>
but
Lady
Arabella
have
be
very
active
.
<EOS>
It
suit
her
better
that
it
should
be
know
,
far
and
wide
,
that
a
nameless
pauper
 
Lady
Arabella
only
surmise
that
her
foe
be
nameless
;
but
she
do
not
scruple
to
declare
it
 
be
intriguing
to
catch
the
heir
of
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
none
of
the
Greshams
must
meet
Mary
Thorne
;
that
be
the
edict
send
about
the
country
;
and
the
edict
be
well
understand
.
<EOS>
those
,
therefore
,
be
bad
day
for
Miss
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
never
yet
speak
on
the
matter
freely
,
out
of
her
full
heart
to
one
human
being
.
<EOS>
not
to
one
?
<EOS>
not
to
him
?
<EOS>
not
to
her
uncle
?
<EOS>
no
,
not
even
to
him
,
fully
and
freely
.
<EOS>
She
have
tell
him
that
that
have
pass
between
Frank
and
her
which
amount
,
at
any
rate
on
his
part
,
to
a
proposal
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
dear
,
and
what
be
your
answer
?
<EOS>
"
say
her
uncle
,
draw
her
close
to
him
,
and
speak
in
his
kind
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
make
any
answer

uncle

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
reject
him
,
Mary
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
uncle
,
"
and
then
she
pause
;
 
he
have
never
know
her
tremble
as
she
now
tremble
.
<EOS>
"
but
if
you
say
that
I
ought
,
I
will
,
"
she
add
,
draw
every
word
from
herself
with
difficulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
you
ought
,
Mary
!
<EOS>
nay
;
but
this
question
you
must
answer
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Must
I
?
"
say
she
,
plaintively
.
<EOS>
and
then
she
sit
for
the
next
half
hour
with
her
head
against
his
shoulder
;
but
nothing
more
be
say
about
it
.
<EOS>
They
both
acquiesce
in
the
sentence
that
have
be
pronounce
against
them
,
and
go
on
together
more
lovingly
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
be
quite
as
weak
as
his
niece
;
nay
,
weak
.
<EOS>
She
hesitate
fearfully
as
to
what
she
ought
to
do
:
whether
she
should
obey
her
heart
or
the
dictate
of
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
other
doubt
than
her
,
which
nearly
set
him
wild
when
he
strove
to
bring
his
mind
to
a
decision
.
<EOS>
He
himself
be
now
in
possession
 
of
course
as
a
trustee
only
 
of
the
title
-
deed
of
the
estate
;
more
of
the
estate
,
much
more
,
belong
to
the
heir
under
<EOS>
Sir
Roger
Scatcherd
's
will
than
to
the
squire
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
more
than
probable
that
that
heir
must
be
Mary
Thorne
.
<EOS>
His
conviction
become
strong
and
strong
that
no
human
effort
would
keep
Sir
Louis
in
the
land
of
the
living
till
he
be
twenty
-
five
.
<EOS>
Could
he
,
therefore
,
wisely
or
honestly
,
in
true
friendship
to
the
squire
,
to
Frank
,
or
to
his
niece
,
take
any
step
to
separate
two
person
who
love
each
other
,
and
whose
marriage
would
in
all
human
probability
be
so
suitable
?
  
<EOS>
and
yet
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
encourage
it
then
.
<EOS>
the
idea
of
"
look
after
dead
man
's
shoe
"
be
abhorrent
to
his
mind
,
especially
when
the
man
whose
death
he
contemplate
have
be
so
trust
to
him
as
have
be
Sir
Louis
Scatcherd
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
speak
of
the
event
,
even
to
the
squire
,
as
be
possible
.
<EOS>
so
he
keep
his
peace
from
day
to
day
,
and
give
no
counsel
to
Mary
in
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
he
have
his
own
individual
annoyance
,
and
very
aggravating
annoyance
they
be
.
<EOS>
the
carriage
 
or
rather
post
-
chaise
 
of
Dr
Fillgrave
be
now
frequent
in
Greshamsbury
,
pass
him
constantly
in
the
street
,
among
the
lane
,
and
on
the
high
road
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
though
Dr
Fillgrave
could
never
get
to
his
patient
at
the
big
house
without
show
himself
to
his
beat
rival
,
either
on
his
way
thither
or
on
his
return
.
<EOS>
this
alone
would
,
perhaps
,
not
have
hurt
the
doctor
much
;
but
it
do
hurt
him
to
know
that
Dr
Fillgrave
be
attend
the
squire
for
a
little
incipient
gout
,
and
that
dear
Nina
be
in
measle
under
those
unlove
hand
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
,
also
,
the
old
-
fashioned
phaeton
,
of
old
-
fashioned
old
Dr
Century
be
see
to
rumble
up
to
the
big
house
,
and
it
become
known
that
Lady
Arabella
be
not
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
not
very
well
,
"
when
pronounce
in
a
low
,
grave
voice
about
Lady
Arabella
,
always
mean
something
serious
.
<EOS>
and
,
in
this
case
,
something
serious
be
mean
.
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
be
not
only
ill
,
but
frightened
.
<EOS>
It
appear
,
even
to
her
,
that
Dr
fillgrave
himself
hardly
know
what
he
be
about
,
that
he
be
not
so
sure
in
his
opinion
,
so
confident
in
himself
,
as
Dr
Thorne
use
to
be
.
<EOS>
how
should
he
be
,
see
that
Dr
Thorne
have
medically
have
Lady
Arabella
in
his
hand
for
the
last
ten
year
?
  
<EOS>
if
sit
with
dignity
in
his
hire
carriage
,
and
step
with
authority
up
the
big
front
step
,
would
have
do
anything
,
Dr
Fillgrave
may
have
do
much
.
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
be
greatly
take
with
his
look
when
he
first
come
to
her
,
and
it
be
only
when
she
by
degree
perceive
that
the
symptom
,
which
she
know
so
well
,
do
not
yield
to
him
that
she
begin
to
doubt
those
look
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
while
Dr
fillgrave
himself
suggest
Dr
Century
.
<EOS>
"
not
that
I
fear
anything
,
Lady
Arabella
,
"
say
he
,
 
lie
hugely
,
for
he
do
fear
;
fear
both
for
himself
and
for
her
.
"
<EOS>
but
Dr
Century
have
great
experience
,
and
in
such
a
matter
,
when
the
interest
be
so
important
,
one
can
not
be
too
safe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
Dr
Century
come
and
toddle
slowly
into
her
ladyship
's
room
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
say
much
;
he
leave
the
talking
to
his
learn
brother
,
who
certainly
be
able
to
do
that
part
of
the
business
.
<EOS>
but
Dr
Century
,
though
he
say
very
little
,
look
very
grave
,
and
by
no
means
quiet
Lady
Arabella
's
mind
.
<EOS>
She
,
as
she
see
the
two
put
their
head
together
,
already
have
misgiving
that
she
have
do
wrong
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
she
could
not
be
safe
without
Dr
Thorne
at
her
bedside
,
and
she
already
feel
that
she
have
exercise
a
most
injudicious
courage
in
drive
him
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
doctor
?
<EOS>
"
say
she
,
as
soon
as
Dr
Century
have
toddle
downstairs
to
see
the
squire
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
we
shall
be
all
right
,
Lady
Arabella
;
all
right
,
very
soon
.
<EOS>
but
we
must
be
careful
,
very
careful
<EOS>
;
I
be
glad
I
have
have
Century
here
,
very
;
but
there
be
nothing
to
alter
;
little
or
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
but
few
word
speak
between
Dr
Century
and
the
squire
;
but
few
as
they
be
,
they
frighten
Mr
Gresham
.
<EOS>
when
Dr
Fillgrave
come
down
the
grand
stair
,
a
servant
wait
at
the
bottom
to
ask
him
also
to
go
to
the
squire
.
<EOS>
now
there
never
have
be
much
cordiality
between
the
squire
and
Dr
Fillgrave
,
though
Mr
Gresham
have
consent
to
take
a
preventative
pill
from
his
hand
,
and
the
little
man
therefore
swell
himself
out
somewhat
more
than
ordinarily
as
he
follow
the
servant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dr
Fillgrave
,
"
say
the
squire
,
at
once
begin
the
conversation
,
"
Lady
Arabella
,
be
,
I
fear
,
in
danger
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
no
;
I
hope
not
in
danger
,
Mr
Gresham
.
<EOS>
I
certainly
believe
I
may
be
justify
in
express
a
hope
that
she
be
not
in
danger
.
<EOS>
Her
state
be
,
no
doubt
,
rather
serious
 
<EOS>
rather
serious
 
as
Dr
Century
have
probably
tell
you
;
"
and
<EOS>
Dr
Fillgrave
make
a
bow
to
the
old
man
,
who
sit
quiet
in
one
of
the
dining
-
room
arm
-
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
doctor
,
"
say
the
squire
,
"
I
have
not
any
ground
on
which
to
doubt
your
judgement
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dr
Fillgrave
bow
,
but
with
the
stiff
,
slight
inclination
which
a
head
could
possibly
make
.
<EOS>
He
rather
think
that
Mr
Gresham
have
no
ground
for
doubt
his
judgement
.
  
<EOS>
"
nor
do
i.
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
bow
,
and
a
little
,
a
very
little
less
stiffly
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
doctor
,
I
think
that
something
ought
to
be
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
this
time
do
his
bowing
merely
with
his
eye
and
mouth
.
<EOS>
the
former
he
close
for
a
moment
,
the
latter
he
press
;
and
then
decorously
rub
his
hand
one
over
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
,
Dr
Fillgrave
,
that
you
and
my
friend
Thorne
be
not
the
good
friend
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Mr
Gresham
,
no
;
I
may
go
so
far
as
to
say
we
be
not

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
be
sorry
for
it
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
perhaps
,
Mr
Gresham

we
need
hardly
discuss
it
;
but
there
have
be
circumstance
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
be
not
go
to
discuss
anything
,
Dr
fillgrave
;
I
say
I
be
sorry
for
it
,
because
I
believe
that
prudence
will
imperatively
require
Lady
Arabella
to
have
Doctor
Thorne
back
again
.
<EOS>
now
,
if
you
would
not
object
to
meet
him
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Gresham
,
I
beg
pardon
;
I
beg
pardon
,
indeed
;
but
you
must
really
excuse
me
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Thorne
have
,
in
my
estimation
 
"
  
"
but
,
Doctor
Fillgrave
 
"
  
"
Mr
Gresham

you
really

me

indeed

<EOS>
anything
else
that
I
could
do
for
Lady
Arabella
,
I
should
be
most
happy
to
do
;
but
after
what
have
pass
,
I
can
not
meet
Doctor
Thorne
;
I
really
can
not

<EOS>
You
must
not
ask
me
to
do
so
;
<EOS>
Mr
Gresham
.
<EOS>
and
,
Mr
Gresham
,
"
continue
the
doctor
,
"
I
do
understand
from
Lady
Arabella
that
his
 
that
is
,
Dr
Thorne
's
 
conduct
to
her
ladyship
have
be
such
 
so
very
outrageous
,
I
may
say
,
that
 
that
 
that
 
of
course
<EOS>
,
Mr
Gresham
,
you
know
best
;
but
I
do
think
that
Lady
Arabella
herself
be
quite
unwilling
to
see
Doctor
Thorne
again
;
"
and
Dr
Fillgrave
look
very
big
,
and
very
dignified
,
and
very
exclusive
.
  
<EOS>
the
squire
do
not
ask
again
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
warrant
for
supposing
that
Lady
Arabella
would
receive
Dr
Thorne
if
he
do
come
;
and
he
see
that
it
be
useless
to
attempt
to
overcome
the
rancour
of
a
man
so
pig
-
head
as
the
little
Galen
now
before
him
.
<EOS>
other
proposition
be
then
broach
,
and
it
be
at
last
decide
that
assistance
should
be
seek
for
from
London
,
in
the
person
of
the
great
Sir
Omicron
Pie
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Omicron
come
,
and
drs
Fillgrave
and
Century
be
there
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
when
they
all
assemble
in
Lady
Arabella
's
room
,
the
poor
woman
's
heart
almost
sink
within
her
,
 
as
well
<EOS>
it
may
,
at
such
a
sight
.
<EOS>
if
she
could
only
reconcile
it
with
her
honour
,
her
consistency
,
with
her
high
de
Courcy
principle
,
to
send
once
more
for
Dr
Thorne
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Frank
!
<EOS>
Frank
!
<EOS>
to
what
misery
your
disobedience
bring
your
mother
!
  
<EOS>
Sir
Omicron
and
the
less
provincial
light
have
their
consultation
,
and
the
less
light
go
their
way
to
Barchester
and
Silverbridge
,
leave
Sir
Omicron
to
enjoy
the
hospitality
of
Greshamsbury
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
Thorne
back
here
,
Mr
Gresham
,
"
say
Sir
Omicron
,
almost
in
a
whisper
,
when
they
be
quite
alone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Doctor
Fillgrave
be
a
very
good
man
,
and
so
be
Dr
Century
;
very
good
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
but
Thorne
have
know
her
ladyship
so
long
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
on
the
follow
morning
,
Sir
Omicron
also
go
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
there
be
a
scene
between
the
squire
and
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
have
give
herself
credit
for
great
good
generalship
when
she
find
that
the
squire
have
be
induce
to
take
that
pill
.
<EOS>
We
have
all
hear
of
the
little
end
of
the
wedge
,
and
we
have
most
of
us
an
idea
that
the
little
end
be
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
that
pill
have
be
the
little
end
of
Lady
Arabella
's
wedge
.
<EOS>
up
to
that
period
she
have
be
struggle
in
vain
to
make
a
severance
between
her
husband
and
her
enemy
.
<EOS>
that
pill
should
do
the
business
.
<EOS>
She
well
know
how
to
make
the
most
of
it
;
to
have
it
publish
in
Greshamsbury
that
the
squire
have
put
his
gouty
toe
into
Dr
Fillgrave
's
hand
;
how
to
let
it
be
know
 
especially
at
that
humble
house
in
the
corner
of
the
street
 
that
Fillgrave
's
prescription
now
run
current
through
the
whole
establishment
.
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
do
hear
of
it
,
and
do
suffer
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
a
true
friend
to
the
squire
,
and
he
think
the
squire
should
have
stand
to
him
more
staunchly
.
  
<EOS>
"
after
all
,
"
say
he
himself
,
"
perhaps
it
be
as
well
 
<EOS>
perhaps
it
will
be
good
that
I
should
leave
this
place
altogether
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
think
of
Sir
Roger
and
his
will
,
and
of
Mary
and
her
lover
.
<EOS>
and
then
of
Mary
's
birth
,
and
of
his
own
theoretical
doctrine
as
to
pure
blood
.
<EOS>
and
so
his
trouble
multiply
,
and
he
see
no
present
daylight
through
them
.
  
<EOS>
such
have
be
the
way
in
which
Lady
Arabella
have
get
in
the
little
end
of
the
wedge
.
<EOS>
and
she
would
have
triumph
joyfully
have
not
her
increase
doubt
and
fear
<EOS>
as
to
herself
then
come
in
to
check
her
triumph
and
destroy
her
joy
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
yet
confess
to
any
one
her
secret
regret
for
the
friend
she
have
drive
away
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
yet
acknowledge
to
herself
that
she
do
regret
him
;
but
she
be
uneasy
,
frightened
,
and
in
low
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
say
the
squire
,
sit
down
by
her
bedside
,
"
I
want
to
tell
you
what
Sir
Omicron
say
as
he
go
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
?
"
say
her
ladyship
,
sit
up
and
look
frightened
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
how
you
may
take
it
,
Bell
;
but
I
think
it
very
good
news
:
"
the
squire
never
call
his
wife
Bell
,
except
when
he
want
her
to
be
on
particularly
good
term
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
?
"
say
she
again
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
over
-
anxious
to
be
gracious
,
and
do
not
reciprocate
his
familiarity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Omicron
say
that
you
should
have
Thorne
back
again
,
and
upon
my
honour
,
I
can
not
but
agree
with
him
.
<EOS>
now
,
Thorne
be
a
clever
man
,
a
very
clever
man
;
nobody
deny
that
;
and
then
,
you
know
 
"
  
"
why
do
not
Sir
Omicron
say
that
to
me
?
"
say
her
ladyship
,
sharply
,
all
her
disposition
in
Dr
Thorne
's
favour
become
wonderfully
damp
by
her
husband
's
advocacy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
think
it
better
to
say
it
to
me
,
"
say
the
squire
,
rather
curtly
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
should
have
speak
to
myself
,
"
say
Lady
Arabella
,
who
,
though
she
do
not
absolutely
doubt
her
husband
's
word
,
give
him
credit
for
have
induce
and
lead
on
Sir
Omicron
to
the
uttering
of
this
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Doctor
Thorne
have
behave
to
me
in
so
gross
,
so
indecent
a
manner
!
<EOS>
and
then
,
as
I
understand
,
he
be
absolutely
encouraging
that
girl
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
now
,
Bell
,
you
be
quite
wrong
 
"
  
"
of
course
I
be
;
I
always
be
quite
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
quite
wrong
in
mix
up
two
thing
;
Doctor
Thorne
as
an
acquaintance
,
and
Dr
Thorne
as
a
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
dreadful
to
have
him
here
,
even
stand
in
the
room
with
me
.
<EOS>
how
can
one
talk
to
one
's
doctor
openly
and
confidentially
when
one
look
upon
him
as
one
's
bad
enemy
?
"
<EOS>
and
Lady
Arabella
,
softening
,
almost
melt
into
tear
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
you
can
not
wonder
that
I
should
be
anxious
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
give
a
little
snuffle
,
which
may
be
take
as
a
not
very
eloquent
expression
of
thank
for
the
squire
's
solicitude
,
or
as
an
ironical
jeer
at
his
want
of
sincerity
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
,
therefore
,
I
have
not
lose
a
moment
in
tell
you
what
Sir
Omicron
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
Thorne
back
here
;
"
those
be
his
very
word
.
<EOS>
You
can
think
it
over
,
my
dear

<EOS>
and
remember

no

<EOS>
and
then
the
squire
leave
the
room

and
Lady
Arabella
remain
alone

perplex
by
many
doubt

<EOS>
Mr
Oriel
 
<EOS>
I
must
now
,
shortly
 
as
shortly
as
it
be
in
my
power
to
do
it
 
introduce
a
new
character
to
my
reader
.
<EOS>
mention
have
be
make
of
the
rectory
of
Greshamsbury
;
but
,
hitherto
,
no
opportunity
have
offer
itself
for
<EOS>
the
Rev
Caleb
Oriel
to
come
upon
the
board
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Oriel
be
a
man
of
family
and
fortune
,
who
,
have
go
to
Oxford
with
the
usual
view
of
such
man
,
have
become
inoculate
there
with
very
high
-
church
principle
,
and
have
go
into
order
influence
by
a
feeling
of
enthusiastic
love
for
the
priesthood
.
<EOS>
He
be
by
no
mean
an
ascetic
 
such
man
,
indeed
,
seldom
be
 
nor
be
he
a
devotee
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
well
able
,
and
certainly
willing
,
to
do
the
work
of
a
parish
clergyman
;
and
when
he
become
one
,
he
be
efficacious
in
his
profession
.
<EOS>
but
it
may
perhaps
be
say
of
him
,
without
speak
slanderously
,
that
his
original
calling
,
as
a
young
man
,
be
rather
to
the
outward
and
visible
sign
of
religion
than
to
its
inward
and
spiritual
grace
.
  
<EOS>
He
delight
in
lectern
and
credence
-
table
,
in
service
at
dark
hour
of
winter
morning
when
no
one
would
attend
,
in
high
waistcoat
and
narrow
white
necktie
,
in
chant
service
and
intone
prayer
,
and
in
all
the
paraphernalia
of
anglican
formality
which
have
give
such
offence
to
those
of
our
brother
who
live
in
daily
fear
of
the
scarlet
lady
.
<EOS>
many
of
his
friend
declare
that
Mr
Oriel
would
sooner
or
later
deliver
himself
over
body
and
soul
to
that
lady
;
but
there
be
no
need
to
fear
for
him
:
for
though
sufficiently
enthusiastic
to
get
out
of
bed
at
five
a.m.
on
winter
morning
 
<EOS>
he
do
so
,
at
least
,
all
through
his
first
winter
at
Greshamsbury
 
<EOS>
he
be
not
make
of
that
stuff
which
be
necessary
for
a
staunch
,
burning
,
self
-
deny
convert
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
him
to
change
his
very
sleek
black
coat
for
a
Capuchin
's
filthy
cassock
,
nor
his
pleasant
parsonage
for
some
dirty
hole
in
Rome
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
well
so
both
for
him
and
other
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
few
,
very
few
,
to
whom
it
be
give
to
be
a
Huss
,
a
Wickliffe
,
or
a
Luther
;
and
a
man
gain
but
little
by
be
a
false
huss
,
or
a
false
Luther
,
 
and
his
neighbour
gain
less
.
  
<EOS>
but
certain
length
in
self
-
privation
Mr
Oriel
do
go
;
at
any
rate
,
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
He
eschew
matrimony
,
imagine
that
it
become
him
as
a
priest
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
fast
rigorously
on
Fridays
;
and
the
neighbour
declare
that
he
scourge
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Oriel
be
,
as
it
have
be
say
,
a
man
of
fortune
;
that
be
to
say
,
when
he
come
of
age
he
be
master
of
thirty
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
when
he
take
it
into
his
head
to
go
into
the
Church
,
his
friend
buy
for
him
the
next
presentation
to
the
living
at
Greshamsbury
;
and
,
a
year
after
his
ordination
,
the
living
fall
in
,
Mr
Oriel
bring
himself
and
his
sister
to
the
rectory
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Oriel
soon
become
popular
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
dark
-
haired
,
good
-
looking
man
,
of
polished
manner
,
agreeable
in
society
,
not
give
to
monkish
austerity
 
except
in
the
matter
of
Fridays
 
nor
yet
to
the
Low
-
church
severity
of
demeanour
.
<EOS>
He
be
thoroughly
a
gentleman
,
good
-
humoured
,
inoffensive
,
and
sociable
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
one
fault
:
he
be
not
a
marry
man
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
ground
there
be
a
feeling
against
him
so
strong
as
almost
at
one
time
to
throw
him
into
serious
danger
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
only
that
he
should
be
swear
against
matrimony
in
his
individual
self
 
he
whom
fate
have
make
so
able
to
sustain
the
weight
of
a
wife
and
family
;
but
what
an
example
he
be
set
!
<EOS>
if
other
clergyman
all
around
should
declare
against
wife
and
family
,
what
be
to
become
of
the
country
?
<EOS>
what
be
to
be
do
in
the
rural
district
?
<EOS>
the
religious
observance
,
as
regard
woman
,
of
a
Brigham
Young
be
hardly
so
bad
as
this
!
  
<EOS>
there
be
around
Greshamsbury
very
many
unmarried
lady
 
<EOS>
I
believe
there
generally
be
so
round
most
such
village
.
<EOS>
from
the
great
house
he
do
not
receive
much
annoyance
.
<EOS>
Beatrice
be
then
only
just
on
the
verge
of
be
bring
out
,
and
be
not
perhaps
incline
to
think
very
much
of
a
young
clergyman
;
and
Augusta
certainly
intend
to
fly
at
high
game
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
the
Miss
Athelings
,
the
daughter
of
a
neighbour
clergyman
,
who
be
ready
to
go
all
length
with
him
in
High
-
church
matter
,
except
as
that
one
tremendously
papal
step
of
celibacy
;
and
the
two
Miss
Hesterwells
,
of
Hesterwell
Park
,
the
young
of
whom
boldly
declare
her
purpose
of
civilise
the
savage
;
and
Mrs
Opie
Green
,
a
very
pretty
widow
,
with
a
very
pretty
jointure
,
who
live
in
a
very
pretty
house
about
a
mile
from
Greshamsbury
,
and
who
declare
her
opinion
that
Mr
Oriel
be
quite
right
in
his
view
of
a
clergyman
's
position
.
<EOS>
how
could
a
woman
,
situate
as
she
be
,
have
the
comfort
of
a
clergyman
's
attention
if
he
be
to
be
regard
just
as
any
other
man
?
<EOS>
She
could
now
know
in
what
light
to
regard
Mr
Oriel
,
and
would
be
able
without
scruple
to
avail
herself
of
his
zeal
.
<EOS>
so
she
do
avail
herself
of
his
zeal
,
 
and
that
without
any
scruple
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
there
be
Miss
Gushing
,
 
a
young
thing
.
<EOS>
Miss
Gushing
have
a
great
advantage
over
the
other
competitor
for
the
civilisation
of
Mr
Oriel
,
namely
,
in
this
 
that
she
be
able
to
attend
his
morning
service
.
<EOS>
if
Mr
Oriel
be
to
be
reach
in
any
way
,
it
be
probable
that
he
may
be
reach
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
if
anything
could
civilise
him
,
this
would
do
it
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
the
young
thing
,
through
all
one
long
,
tedious
winter
,
tear
herself
from
her
warm
bed
,
and
be
to
be
see
 
no
,
not
see
,
but
hear
 
enter
Mr
Oriel
's
church
at
six
o'clock
.
<EOS>
with
indefatigable
assiduity
the
response
be
make
,
uttered
from
under
a
close
bonnet
,
and
out
of
a
dark
corner
,
in
an
enthusiastically
feminine
voice
,
through
the
whole
winter
.
  
<EOS>
nor
do
Miss
gush
altogether
fail
in
her
object
.
<EOS>
when
a
clergyman
's
daily
audience
consist
of
but
one
person
,
and
that
person
be
a
young
lady
,
it
be
hardly
possible
that
he
should
not
become
personally
intimate
with
her
;
hardly
possible
that
he
should
not
be
in
some
measure
grateful
.
<EOS>
Miss
Gushing
's
response
come
from
her
with
such
fervour
,
and
she
beg
for
ghostly
advice
with
such
eager
longing
to
have
her
scruple
satisfy
,
that
Mr
Oriel
have
nothing
for
it
but
to
give
way
to
a
certain
amount
of
civilisation
.
  
<EOS>
by
degree
it
come
to
pass
that
Miss
Gushing
could
never
get
her
final
prayer
say
,
her
shawl
and
boa
adjust
,
and
stow
away
her
nice
new
Prayer
-
Book
with
the
red
letter
inside
,
and
the
cross
on
the
back
,
till
Mr
Oriel
have
be
into
his
vestry
and
get
rid
of
his
surplice
.
<EOS>
and
then
they
meet
at
the
church
-
porch
,
and
naturally
walk
together
till
Mr
Oriel
's
cruel
gateway
separate
them
.
<EOS>
the
young
thing
do
sometimes
think
that
,
as
the
parson
's
civilisation
progress
,
he
may
have
take
the
trouble
to
walk
with
her
as
far
as
Mr
Yates
Umbleby
's
hall
door
;
but
she
have
hope
to
sustain
her
,
and
a
firm
resolve
to
merit
success
,
even
though
she
may
not
attain
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
not
ten
thousand
pity
,
"
she
once
say
to
him
,
"
that
none
here
should
avail
themselves
of
the
inestimable
privilege
which
your
coming
have
confer
upon
us
?
<EOS>
oh
,
Mr
Oriel
,
I
do
so
wonder
at
it
!
<EOS>
to
me
it
be
so
delightful
!
<EOS>
the
morning
service
in
the
dark
church
be
so
beautiful
,
so
touching
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
they
think
it
be
a
bore
get
up
so
early
,
"
say
Mr
Oriel
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
a
bore
!
"
say
Miss
Gushing
,
in
an
enthusiastic
tone
of
depreciation
.
<EOS>
"
how
insensate
they
must
be
!
<EOS>
to
me
it
give
a
new
charm
to
life
.
<EOS>
It
quiet
one
for
the
day
;
make
one
so
much
fitter
for
one
's
daily
trial
and
daily
trouble
.
<EOS>
do
it
not
,
Mr
Oriel
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
look
upon
morning
prayer
as
an
imperative
duty
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
certainly
,
a
most
imperative
duty
;
but
so
delicious
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
I
speak
to
Mrs
Umbleby
about
it
,
but
she
say
she
could
not
leave
the
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
:
I
dare
say
not
,
"
say
Mr
Oriel
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
Mr
Umbleby
say
his
business
keep
him
up
so
late
at
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
very
probably
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
expect
the
attendance
of
man
of
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
the
servant
may
come
,
might
not
they
,
Mr
Oriel
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
that
servant
seldom
can
have
time
for
daily
prayer
in
church
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
ah
,
no
;
perhaps
not
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
Miss
Gushing
begin
to
bethink
herself
of
whom
should
be
compose
the
congregation
which
it
must
be
presume
that
Mr
Oriel
wish
to
see
around
him
.
<EOS>
but
on
this
matter
he
do
not
enlighten
her
.
  
<EOS>
then
Miss
Gushing
take
to
fast
on
Fridays
,
and
make
some
futile
attempt
to
induce
her
priest
to
give
her
the
comfort
of
confessional
absolution
.
<EOS>
but
,
unfortunately
,
the
zeal
of
the
master
wax
cool
as
that
of
the
pupil
wax
hot
;
and
,
at
last
,
when
the
young
thing
return
to
Greshamsbury
from
an
autumn
excursion
which
she
have
make
with
Mrs
Umbleby
to
Weston
-
super
-
mare
,
she
find
that
the
delicious
morning
service
have
die
a
natural
death
.
<EOS>
Miss
Gushing
do
not
on
that
account
give
up
the
game
,
but
she
be
bind
to
fight
with
no
particular
advantage
in
her
favour
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Oriel
,
though
a
good
Churchwoman
,
be
by
no
mean
a
convert
to
her
brother
's
extremist
view
,
and
perhaps
give
but
scanty
credit
to
the
Gushings
,
atheling
,
and
Opie
Greens
for
the
sincerity
of
their
religion
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
she
and
her
brother
be
staunch
friend
;
and
she
still
hope
to
see
the
day
when
he
may
be
induce
to
think
that
an
english
parson
may
get
through
his
parish
work
with
the
assistance
of
a
wife
better
than
he
could
do
without
such
feminine
encumbrance
.
<EOS>
the
girl
whom
she
select
for
his
bride
be
not
the
young
thing
,
but
Beatrice
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
and
at
last
it
seem
probable
to
Mr
Oriel
's
near
friend
that
he
be
in
a
fair
way
to
be
overcome
.
<EOS>
not
that
he
have
begin
to
make
love
to
Beatrice
,
or
commit
himself
by
the
utterance
of
any
opinion
as
to
the
propriety
of
clerical
marriage
;
but
he
daily
become
loose
about
his
peculiar
tenet
,
rave
less
immoderately
than
heretofore
as
to
the
atrocity
of
the
Greshamsbury
church
pew
,
and
be
observe
to
take
some
opportunity
of
converse
alone
with
Beatrice
.
<EOS>
Beatrice
have
always
deny
the
imputation
 
<EOS>
this
have
usually
be
make
by
Mary
in
their
happy
day
 
with
vehement
asseveration
of
anger
;
and
Miss
Gushing
have
titter
,
and
express
herself
as
suppose
that
great
people
's
daughter
may
be
as
bareface
as
they
please
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
have
happen
previous
to
the
great
Greshamsbury
feud
.
<EOS>
Mr
Oriel
gradually
get
himself
into
a
way
of
saunter
up
to
the
great
house
,
saunter
into
the
drawing
-
room
for
the
purpose
,
as
I
be
sure
he
think
,
of
talk
to
Lady
Arabella
,
and
then
of
saunter
home
again
,
have
usually
find
an
opportunity
for
say
a
few
word
to
Beatrice
during
the
visit
.
<EOS>
this
go
on
all
through
the
feud
up
to
the
period
of
Lady
Arabella
's
illness
;
and
then
one
morning
,
about
a
month
before
the
date
fix
for
Frank
's
return
,
Mr
Oriel
find
himself
engage
to
Miss
Beatrice
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
from
the
day
that
Miss
Gushing
hear
of
it
 
which
be
not
however
for
some
considerable
time
after
this
 
<EOS>
she
become
an
Independent
Methodist
.
<EOS>
She
could
no
longer
,
she
say
at
first
,
have
any
faith
in
any
religion
;
and
for
an
hour
or
so
she
be
almost
tempt
to
swear
that
she
could
no
longer
have
any
faith
in
any
man
.
<EOS>
She
have
nearly
complete
a
worked
cover
for
a
credence
-
table
when
the
news
reach
her
,
as
to
which
,
in
the
young
enthusiasm
of
her
heart
,
she
have
not
be
able
to
remain
silent
;
it
have
already
be
promise
to
Mr
Oriel
;
that
promise
she
swear
should
not
be
keep
.
<EOS>
He
be
an
apostate
,
she
say
,
from
his
principle
;
an
utter
pervert
;
a
false
,
design
man
,
with
whom
she
would
never
have
trust
herself
alone
on
dark
morning
<EOS>
have
she
know
that
he
have
such
grovelling
,
worldly
inclination
.
<EOS>
so
Miss
Gushing
become
an
Independent
Methodist
;
the
credence
-
table
covering
be
cut
up
into
slipper
for
the
preacher
's
foot
;
and
the
young
thing
herself
,
more
happy
in
this
direction
than
she
have
be
in
the
other
,
become
the
arbiter
of
that
preacher
's
domestic
happiness

<EOS>
but
this
little
history
of
Miss
Gushing
's
future
life
be
premature
.
<EOS>
Mr
Oriel
become
engage
demurely
,
nay
,
almost
silently
,
to
Beatrice
,
and
no
one
out
of
their
own
immediate
family
be
at
the
time
inform
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
It
be
arrange
very
differently
from
those
two
other
match
 
embryo
,
or
not
embryo
,
those
,
namely
,
of
Augusta
with
Mr
Moffat
,
and
Frank
with
Mary
Thorne
.
<EOS>
all
Barsetshire
have
hear
of
them
;
but
that
of
Beatrice
and
Mr
Oriel
be
manage
in
a
much
more
private
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
think
you
be
a
happy
girl
,
"
say
Patience
to
her
one
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
so
good
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
how
good
he
be
as
yet
;
he
never
think
of
himself
,
and
think
so
much
of
those
he
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Beatrice
take
her
friend
's
hand
in
her
own
and
kiss
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
full
of
joy
.
<EOS>
when
a
girl
be
about
to
be
marry
,
when
she
may
lawfully
talk
of
her
love
,
there
be
no
music
in
her
ear
so
sweet
as
the
praise
of
her
lover
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
make
up
my
mind
from
the
first
that
he
should
marry
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
Patience
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
make
up
my
mind
that
he
should
marry
;
and
there
be
only
two
to
choose
from
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Me
and
Miss
Gushing
,
"
say
Beatrice
,
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
not
exactly
<EOS>
Miss
Gushing
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
many
fear
for
Caleb
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
declare
she
be
very
pretty
,
"
say
Beatrice
,
who
could
afford
to
be
good
-
natured
.
<EOS>
now
Miss
Gushing
certainly
be
pretty
;
and
would
have
be
very
pretty
have
<EOS>
her
nose
not
turn
up
so
much
,
and
could
she
have
part
her
hair
in
the
centre
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
be
very
glad
you
choose
me
;
 
if
it
be
you
who
choose
,
"
say
Beatrice
,
modestly
;
have
,
however
,
in
her
own
mind
a
strong
opinion
that
Mr
Oriel
have
choose
for
himself
,
and
have
never
have
any
doubt
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
who
be
the
other
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
can
not
you
guess
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
guess
any
more
;
perhaps
Mrs
Green
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
;
certainly
not
a
widow
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
widow
marry
.
<EOS>
but
of
course
you
could
guess
if
you
would
;
of
course
it
be
Mary
Thorne
.
<EOS>
but
I
soon
see
Mary
would
not
do
,
for
two
reason
;
Caleb
would
never
have
like
her
well
enough
nor
would
she
ever
have
like
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
like
him
!
<EOS>
oh
I
hope
she
will
;
I
do
so
love
Mary
Thorne
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
so
do
I
,
dearly
;
and
so
do
Caleb
;
but
he
could
never
have
love
her
as
he
love
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Patience
,
have
you
tell
Mary
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
have
tell
no
one
,
and
shall
not
without
your
leave
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
you
must
tell
her
.
<EOS>
tell
it
her
with
my
good
,
and
kindest
,
warm
love
.
<EOS>
tell
her
how
happy
I
be
,
and
how
I
long
to
talk
to
her
.
<EOS>
tell
that
I
will
have
her
for
my
bridesmaid
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
do
hope
that
before
that
all
this
horrid
quarrel
will
be
settle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Patience
undertake
the
commission
,
and
do
tell
Mary
;
do
give
her
also
the
message
which
Beatrice
have
send
.
<EOS>
and
Mary
be
rejoice
to
hear
it
;
for
though
,
as
Patience
have
say
of
her
,
she
have
never
herself
feel
any
inclination
to
fall
in
love
with
Mr
Oriel
,
she
believe
him
to
be
one
in
whose
hand
her
friend
's
happiness
would
be
secure
.
<EOS>
then
,
by
degree
,
the
conversation
change
from
the
love
of
Mr
Oriel
and
Beatrice
to
the
trouble
of
Frank
Gresham
and
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
say
,
that
let
what
will
happen
you
shall
be
one
of
her
bridesmaid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
yes
,
dear
Trichy
!
<EOS>
that
be
settle
between
us
in
auld
lang
syne
;
but
those
settlement
be
all
unsettled
now
,
must
all
be
break
.
<EOS>
no
,
I
can
not
be
her
bridesmaid
;
but
I
shall
yet
hope
to
see
her
once
before
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
not
be
her
bridesmaid
?
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
will
hardly
object
to
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Arabella
!
<EOS>
"
say
Mary
,
curl
her
lip
with
deep
scorn
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
that
for
Lady
Arabella
,
"
and
she
let
her
silver
thimble
fall
from
her
finger
on
to
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
if
Beatrice
invite
me
to
her
wedding
,
she
may
manage
as
to
that
;
I
should
ask
no
question
as
to
Lady
Arabella
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
why
not
come
to
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
remain
silent
for
a
while
,
and
then
boldly
answer
.
<EOS>
"
though
I
do
not
care
for
Lady
Arabella
,
I
do
care
for
Mr
Gresham
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
do
care
for
his
son
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
the
squire
always
love
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
and
therefore
I
will
not
be
there
to
vex
his
sight
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
the
truth
,
Patience
.
<EOS>
I
can
never
be
in
that
house
again
till
Frank
Gresham
be
a
married
man
,
or
till
I
be
about
to
be
a
married
woman
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
they
have
treat
me
well
,
but
I
will
not
treat
them
ill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
you
will
not
do
that
,
"
say
Miss
Oriel
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
endeavour
not
to
do
so
;
and
,
therefore
,
will
go
to
none
of
their
fête
!
<EOS>
no
,
Patience
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
she
turn
her
head
to
the
arm
of
the
sofa
,
and
silently
,
without
audible
sobs
,
hide
her
face
<EOS>
,
she
endeavour
to
get
rid
of
her
tear
unseen
.
<EOS>
for
one
moment
she
have
all
but
resolve
to
pour
out
the
whole
truth
of
her
love
into
her
friend
's
ear
;
but
suddenly
she
change
her
mind
.
<EOS>
why
should
she
talk
of
her
own
unhappiness
?
<EOS>
why
should
she
speak
of
her
own
love
when
she
be
fully
determined
not
to
speak
of
Frank
's
promise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
dear
Mary
.
"
  
"
anything
but
pity
,
patience
;
anything
but
that
,
"
say
she
,
convulsively
,
swallow
down
her
sobs
,
and
rub
away
her
tear
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
bear
that
.
<EOS>
tell
Beatrice
from
me
,
that
I
wish
her
every
happiness
;
and
,
with
such
a
husband
,
I
be
sure
she
will
be
happy
.
<EOS>
I
wish
her
every
joy
;
give
her
my
kind
love
;
but
tell
her
I
can
not
be
at
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
oh
,
I
should
so
like
to
see
her
;
not
there
,
you
know
,
but
here
,
in
my
own
room
,
where
I
still
have
liberty
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
why
should
you
decide
now
?
<EOS>
She
be
not
to
be
marry
yet
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
now
,
or
this
day
twelvemonth
,
can
make
no
difference

<EOS>
I
will
not
go
into
that
house
again

never
mind
;
I
will
not
go
into
it
all

never

never
again

I

forgive
her
for
myself

I

for
my
uncle

tell
me
,
Patience
,
may
not
Beatrice
now
come
here
?
<EOS>
It
be
so
dreadful
to
see
her
every
Sunday
in
church
and
never
to
speak
to
her
,
never
to
kiss
her
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
look
away
from
me
as
though
she
too
have
choose
to
quarrel
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Oriel
promise
to
do
her
good
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
imagine
,
she
say
,
that
such
a
visit
could
be
object
to
on
such
an
occasion
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
advise
Beatrice
to
come
without
tell
her
mother
;
but
she
could
not
think
that
Lady
Arabella
would
be
so
cruel
as
to
make
any
objection
,
know
,
as
she
could
not
but
know
,
that
her
daughter
,
when
married
,
would
be
at
liberty
to
choose
her
own
friend

<EOS>
"
good
-
bye
,
Mary
,
"
say
Patience
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
know
how
to
say
more
to
comfort
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
comfort
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
comfort
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
be
let
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
just
it
:
you
be
so
ferocious
in
your
scorn
,
so
unbending
,
so
determined
to
take
all
the
punishment
that
come
in
your
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
what
I
do
take
,
I
will
take
without
complaint

"
say
Mary
;
and
then
they
kiss
each
other
and
parted
.
   
<EOS>
a
morning
visit
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
remember
that
Mary
,
among
her
misery
,
have
to
suffer
this
:
that
since
Frank
's
departure
,
now
nearly
twelve
month
ago
,
she
have
not
hear
a
word
about
him
;
or
rather
,
she
have
only
hear
that
he
be
very
much
in
love
with
some
lady
in
London
.
<EOS>
this
news
reach
her
in
a
manner
so
circuitous
,
and
from
such
a
doubtful
source
;
it
seem
to
her
to
savour
so
strongly
of
Lady
Arabella
's
precaution
,
that
she
attribute
it
at
once
to
malice
,
and
blow
it
to
the
wind
.
<EOS>
It
may
not
improbably
be
the
case
that
Frank
be
untrue
to
her
;
but
she
would
not
take
it
for
grant
because
she
be
now
tell
so
.
<EOS>
It
be
more
than
probable
that
he
should
amuse
himself
with
some
one
;
flirting
be
his
prevail
sin
;
and
if
he
do
flirt
,
the
most
would
of
course
be
make
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
find
it
to
be
very
desolate
to
be
thus
leave
alone
without
a
word
of
comfort
or
a
word
of
love
;
without
be
able
to
speak
to
any
one
of
what
fill
her
heart
;
doubting
,
nay
,
more
than
doubt
,
be
all
<EOS>
but
sure
that
her
passion
must
terminate
in
misery
.
<EOS>
why
have
she
not
obey
her
conscience
and
her
well
instinct
in
that
moment
when
the
necessity
for
decide
have
come
upon
her
?
<EOS>
why
have
she
allow
him
to
understand
that
he
be
master
of
her
heart
?
<EOS>
do
she
not
know
that
there
be
everything
against
such
a
marriage
as
that
which
he
propose
?
<EOS>
have
she
not
do
wrong
,
very
wrong
,
even
to
think
of
it
?
<EOS>
have
she
not
sin
deeply
,
against
Mr
Gresham
,
who
have
ever
be
so
kind
to
her
?
<EOS>
Could
she
hope
,
be
it
possible
,
that
a
boy
like
Frank
should
be
true
to
his
first
love
?
<EOS>
and
,
if
he
be
true
,
if
he
be
ready
to
go
to
the
altar
with
her
to
-
morrow
,
ought
she
to
allow
him
to
degrade
himself
by
such
a
marriage
?
  
<EOS>
there
be
,
alas
!
<EOS>
some
truth
about
the
London
lady
.
<EOS>
Frank
have
take
his
degree
,
as
arrange
,
and
have
then
go
abroad
for
the
winter
,
do
the
fashionable
thing
,
go
up
the
Nile
,
cross
over
to
Mount
Sinai
,
thence
over
the
long
desert
to
Jerusalem
,
and
home
by
Damascus
,
Beyrout
,
and
Constantinople
,
bring
back
a
long
beard
,
a
red
cap
,
and
a
chibook
,
just
as
our
father
use
to
go
through
Italy
and
Switzerland
,
and
our
grandfather
to
spend
a
season
in
Paris
.
<EOS>
He
have
then
remain
for
a
couple
of
month
in
London
,
go
through
all
the
society
which
the
de
Courcys
be
able
to
open
to
him
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
true
that
a
certain
belle
of
the
season
,
of
that
season
and
some
other
,
have
be
captivate
 
for
the
tenth
time
 
by
the
silken
sheen
of
his
long
beard
.
<EOS>
Frank
have
probably
be
more
demonstrative
,
perhaps
even
more
susceptible
,
than
he
should
have
be
;
and
hence
the
rumour
,
which
have
all
too
willingly
be
forward
to
Greshamsbury
.
  
<EOS>
but
young
Gresham
have
also
meet
another
lady
in
London
,
namely
Miss
Dunstable
.
<EOS>
Mary
would
indeed
have
be
grateful
to
Miss
Dunstable
,
could
she
have
know
all
that
lady
do
for
her
.
<EOS>
Frank
's
love
be
never
allow
to
flag
.
<EOS>
when
he
speak
of
the
difficulty
in
his
way
,
she
twit
him
by
be
overcome
by
straw
;
and
tell
him
that
no
one
be
worth
have
who
be
afraid
of
every
lion
that
he
meet
in
his
path
.
<EOS>
when
he
speak
of
money
,
she
bid
him
earn
it
;
and
always
end
by
offer
to
smooth
for
him
any
real
difficulty
which
want
of
mean
may
put
in
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
Frank
use
to
say
to
himself
,
when
these
offer
be
make
,
"
I
never
intend
to
take
her
and
her
money
together
;
and
,
therefore
,
I
certainly
will
never
take
the
money
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
a
day
or
two
after
Miss
Oriel
's
visit
,
Mary
receive
the
follow
note
from
Beatrice
.
  
<EOS>
DEAREST

wedding
to
be
on
the
1st
of
September
;
but
that
seem
to
be
so
very
,
very
soon
;
do
not
it
?
<EOS>
however
,
mamma
and
papa
be
all
on
his
side
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
write
about
this
,
though
,
for
we
shall
have
such
a
delicious
talk
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Mary
!
<EOS>
I
have
be
so
unhappy
without
you
.
  
<EOS>
ever
your
own
affectionate
,
  
<EOS>
TRICHY
  
Monday
.
  
<EOS>
though
Mary
be
delight
at
the
idea
of
once
more
have
her
friend
in
her
arm
,
there
be
,
nevertheless
,
something
in
this
letter
which
oppress
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
put
up
with
the
idea
that
Beatrice
should
have
permission
give
to
come
to
her
 
just
for
once
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
wish
to
be
see
by
permission
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
she
do
not
refuse
the
proffer
visit
,
and
the
first
sight
of
Beatrice
's
face
,
the
first
touch
of
the
first
embrace
,
dissipate
for
the
moment
all
her
anger
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
Beatrice
fully
enjoy
the
delicious
talk
which
she
have
promise
herself
.
<EOS>
Mary
let
her
have
her
way
,
and
for
two
hour
all
the
delight
and
all
the
duty
,
all
the
comfort
and
all
the
responsibility
of
a
parson
's
wife
be
discuss
with
almost
equal
ardour
on
both
side
.
<EOS>
the
duty
and
responsibility
be
not
exactly
those
which
too
often
fall
to
the
lot
of
the
mistress
of
an
english
vicarage
.
<EOS>
Beatrice
be
not
doom
to
make
her
husband
comfortable
,
to
educate
her
child
,
dress
herself
like
a
lady
,
and
exercise
open
-
handed
charity
on
an
income
of
two
hundred
pound
a
year
.
<EOS>
Her
duty
and
responsibility
would
have
to
spread
themselves
over
seven
or
eight
time
that
amount
of
worldly
burden
.
<EOS>
live
also
close
to
Greshamsbury
,
and
not
far
from
Courcy
Castle
,
she
would
have
the
full
advantage
and
all
the
privilege
of
county
society
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
it
be
all
_
couleur
de
rise
_
,
and
so
she
chat
deliciously
with
her
friend
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
impossible
that
they
should
separate
without
something
have
be
say
as
to
Mary
's
own
lot
.
<EOS>
It
would
,
perhaps
,
have
be
well
that
they
should
do
so
;
but
this
be
hardly
within
the
compass
of
human
nature
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
Mary
,
you
know
,
I
shall
be
able
to
see
you
as
often
as
I
like
;
 
you
and
Dr
Thorne
,
too
,
when
I
have
a
house
of
my
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
say
nothing
,
but
essay
to
smile
.
<EOS>
It
be
but
a
ghastly
attempt
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
how
happy
that
will
make
me
,
"
continue
Beatrice
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
mamma
will
not
expect
me
to
be
lead
by
her
then
:
if
he
like
it
,
there
can
be
no
objection
;
and
he
will
like
it
<EOS>
,
you
may
be
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
kind
,
Trichy
,
"
say
Mary
;
but
she
speak
in
a
tone
very
different
from
that
she
would
have
use
eighteen
month
ago
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
what
be
the
matter
,
Mary
?
<EOS>
shall
not
you
be
glad
to
come
to
see
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
dear
;
that
must
depend
on
circumstance
.
<EOS>
to
see
you
,
you
yourself
,
your
own
dear
,
sweet
,
love
face
must
always
be
pleasant
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
shall
not
you
be
glad
to
see
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
certainly
,
if
he
love
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
he
love
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
all
that
alone
would
be
pleasant
enough
,
Trichy
.
<EOS>
but
what
if
there
should
be
circumstance
which
should
still
make
us
enemy
;
should
make
your
friend
and
my
friend
 
friend
,
I
should
say
,
for
I
have
<EOS>
only
one
 
should
make
them
opposed
to
each
other
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
circumstance
!
<EOS>
what
circumstance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
go
to
be
marry
,
Trichy
,
to
the
man
you
love
;
be
you
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
I
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
it
be
not
pleasant
?
<EOS>
be
it
not
a
happy
feeling
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
pleasant
!
<EOS>
happy
!
<EOS>
yes
,
very
pleasant
;
very
happy
.
<EOS>
but
,
Mary
,
I
be
not
at
all
in
such
a
hurry
as
he
be
,
"
say
Beatrice
,
naturally
think
of
her
own
little
affair
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
,
suppose
I
should
wish
to
be
married
to
the
man
that
I
love
?
"
<EOS>
Mary
say
this
slowly
and
gravely
,
and
as
she
speak
she
look
her
friend
full
in
the
face
.
  
<EOS>
Beatrice
be
somewhat
astonished
,
and
for
the
moment
hardly
understand
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
hope
you
will
,
some
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Trichy
;
no
,
you
hope
the
other
way
.
<EOS>
I
love
your
brother
;
I
love
Frank
Gresham
;
I
love
him
quite
as
well
,
quite
as
warmly
,
as
you
love
Caleb
Oriel
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
you
?
"
say
Beatrice
,
stare
with
all
her
eye
,
and
give
one
long
sigh
,
as
this
new
subject
for
sorrow
be
so
distinctly
put
before
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
that
so
odd
?
"
say
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
You
love
Mr
Oriel
,
though
you
have
be
intimate
with
him
hardly
more
than
two
year
.
<EOS>
be
it
so
odd
that
I
should
love
your
brother
,
whom
I
have
know
almost
all
my
life
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Mary
,
I
think
it
be
always
understand
between
us
that
 
that
 
<EOS>
I
mean
that
you
be
not
to
care
about
him
;
<EOS>
not
in
the
way
of
love
him
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
always
say
so
 
I
have
always
tell
mamma
so
as
if
it
come
from
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Beatrice
,
do
not
tell
anything
to
Lady
Arabella
as
though
it
come
from
me
;
I
do
not
want
anything
to
be
tell
to
her
,
either
of
me
or
from
me
.
<EOS>
say
what
you
like
to
me
yourself
;
whatever
you
say
will
not
anger
me
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
know
what
you
would
say
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
love
you
.
<EOS>
oh
,
I
love
you
,
Trichy
 
Trichy
,
I
do
love
you
so
much
!
<EOS>
do
not
turn
away
from
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
such
a
mixture
in
Mary
's
manner
of
tenderness
and
almost
ferocity
,
that
poor
Beatrice
could
hardly
follow
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
turn
away
from
you
,
Mary
!
<EOS>
no
never
;
but
this
do
make
me
unhappy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
well
that
you
should
know
it
all
,
and
then
you
will
not
be
lead
into
fight
my
battle
again
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
fight
them
so
that
I
should
win
;
I
do
love
your
brother
;
love
him
truly
,
fondly
,
tenderly
.
<EOS>
I
would
wish
to
have
him
for
my
husband
as
you
wish
to
have
Mr
Oriel

"

,
Mary
,
you
can
not

him

"
  
<EOS>
"
why
not

"
say
she
,
in
a
loud
voice

why

not

<EOS>
if
the
priest
say
a
blessing

we
not

marry
as
well

shall
have
money

money
 
money

and
he
be
to
sell
himself
for
money

<EOS>
oh
,
Trichy
!
<EOS>
do
not
you
talk
about
money
.
<EOS>
It
be
horrible

but
,
Trichy
,
I
will
grant
it
 
<EOS>
I
can

still

I
love
him

He
have
a
name

a
place
in
the
world

and
fortune
,
family
,
high
blood
,
position
,
everything

He
have
all
this
,

I
have
nothing

of
course
I
can
not

him

yet
I
do
love
him

"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
engaged
to
him
,
Mary

"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
not
engage
to
me
;
but
I
be
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mary
,
that
be
impossible
!
"
  
<EOS>

It

not

it

the
case

,
Mary
,
do
not

at
me
in

you

the
good
of

good

there
be
no

can
I

just
wish
it

oh
,
I
would
do
it
if
I
could

now
you
will
understand
why
I
shake
my
head
when
you
talk
of
my
come
to
your
house
.
<EOS>
Your
way
and
my
way
must
be
different
.
"
  
<EOS>
Beatrice
be
startle
,
and
,
for
a
time
,
silence
.
<EOS>
what
Mary
say
of
the
difference
of
their
way
be
quite
true
.
<EOS>
Beatrice
have
dearly
love
her
friend
,
and
have
think
of
her
with
affection
through
all
this
long
period
in
which
they
have
be
separate
;
but
she
have
give
her
love
and
her
thought
on
the
understanding
,
as
it
be
,
that
they
be
in
unison
as
to
the
impropriety
of
Frank
's
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
always
speak
,
with
a
grave
face
,
of
Frank
and
his
love
as
of
a
great
misfortune
,
even
to
Mary
herself
;
and
her
pity
for
Mary
have
be
found
on
the
conviction
of
her
innocence
.
<EOS>
now
all
those
idea
have
to
be
alter
.
<EOS>
Mary
own
her
fault
,
confess
herself
to
be
guilty
of
all
that
Lady
Arabella
so
frequently
lay
to
her
charge
,
and
confess
herself
anxious
to
commit
every
crime
as
to
which
Beatrice
have
be
ever
so
ready
to
defend
her
.
  
<EOS>
have
Beatrice
up
to
this
dream
that
Mary
be
in
love
with
Frank
,
she
would
doubtless
<EOS>
have
sympathise
with
her
more
or
less
,
sooner
or
later
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
be
be
beyond
all
doubt
that
she
would
soon
sympathise
with
her
.
<EOS>
but
,
at
the
moment
,
the
suddenness
of
the
declaration
seem
to
harden
her
heart
,
and
she
forget
,
as
it
be
,
to
speak
tenderly
to
her
friend
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
silent
,
therefore
,
and
dismay
;
and
look
as
though
she
think
that
her
way
and
Mary
's
way
must
be
different
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
see
all
that
be
pass
in
the
other
's
mind
:
no
,
not
all
;
all
the
hostility
,
the
disappointment
,
the
disapproval
,
the
unhappiness
,
she
do
see
;
but
not
the
under
-
current
of
love
,
which
be
strong
enough
to
well
up
and
drown
all
these
,
if
only
time
could
be
allow
for
it
to
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
I
have
tell
you
,
"
say
Mary
,
curb
herself
,
"
for
deceit
and
hypocrisy
be
detestable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
misunderstanding
,
not
deceit
,
"
say
Beatrice
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
now
we
understand
each
other
;
now
you
know
that
I
have
a
heart
within
me
,
which
like
those
of
some
other
have
not
always
be
under
my
own
control

<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
believe
that
I
be
intriguing
to
be
the
mistress
of
Greshamsbury

<EOS>
You
,
at
any
rate
,
will
not
think
that
of
me

if
it
could
be
discover
to

morrow

Frank
be
not
the
heir

I
may
have
some
chance
of
happiness

<EOS>

yes

do

so

will
you
cease
to

<EOS>
"
if
I
have
a
fever
,
I
will
get
rid
of
it
if
I
can

in
such
case
I
must
do
so
,
or
die

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
,
"
continue
Beatrice
,
"
you
hardly
know
,
perhaps
do
not
think
,
what
be
Frank
's
real
character
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
make
to
settle
down
early
in
life
;
even
now
,
I
believe
he
be
attach
to
some
lady
in
London
,
whom
,
of
course
,
he
can
not
marry

"
  
<EOS>
Beatrice
say
this
in
perfect
trueness
of
heart
.
<EOS>
She
have
hear
of
Frank
's
new
love
-
affair
,
and
believe
what
she
have
hear
,
think
it
best
to
tell
the
truth
.
<EOS>
but
the
information
be
not
of
a
kind
to
quiet
Mary
's
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
well

she

"
let
it
be
so

<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
say
against
it

be
you
not

wretchedness

very

not

yes

it
not

<EOS>
impossible
that
Francis

of
Greshamsbury

disgrace
himself
by
marry
such
a
poor
creature

I
be

of

I

I
love
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Mary
,
have
he
ask
you
to
be
his
wife
?
<EOS>
if
so
 
"
  
"
You
ask
home
-
question
,
Beatrice
.
<EOS>
let
me
ask
you
one
;
have
he
ever
tell
you
that
he
have
do
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
at
this
moment
Beatrice
be
not
dispose
to
repeat
all
that
Frank
have
say
.
<EOS>
a
year
ago
,
before
he
go
away
,
he
have
tell
his
sister
a
score
of
time
that
he
mean
to
marry
Mary
Thorne
if
she
would
have
him
;
but
Beatrice
now
look
on
all
that
as
idle
,
boyish
vapouring
.
<EOS>
the
pity
be
,
that
Mary
should
have
look
on
it
differently
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
each
keep
our
secret
,
"
say
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
only
remember
this
:
<EOS>
should
Frank
marry
to
-
morrow
,
I
shall
have
no
ground
for
blame
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
free
as
far
I
as
be
concerned
.
<EOS>
He
can
take
the
London
lady
if
he
like
.
<EOS>
You
may
tell
him
so
from
me
.
<EOS>
but
,
Trichy
,
what
else
I
have
tell
you
,
I
have
tell
you
only
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
!
"
say
Beatrice
,
sadly
;
"
I
shall
say
nothing
of
it
to
anybody
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
sad
,
very
,
very
;
I
be
so
happy
when
I
come
here
,
and
now
I
be
so
wretched
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
end
of
that
delicious
talk
to
which
she
have
look
forward
with
so
much
eagerness
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
be
wretched
about
me
,
dear
;
I
shall
get
through
it
.
<EOS>
I
sometimes
think
I
be
bear
to
be
unhappy
,
and
that
unhappiness
agree
with
me
good
.
<EOS>
kiss
me
now
,
Trichy
,
and
do
not
be
wretched
any
more
.
<EOS>
You
owe
it
to
Mr
Oriel
to
be
as
happy
as
the
day
be
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
they
part
.
  
<EOS>
Beatrice
,
as
she
go
out
,
see
Dr
Thorne
in
his
little
shop
on
the
right
-
hand
side
of
the
passage
,
deeply
engage
in
some
derogatory
branch
of
an
apothecary
's
mechanical
trade
;
mix
a
dose
,
perhaps
,
for
a
little
child
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
pass
him
without
speak
if
she
could
have
be
sure
of
do
so
without
notice
,
for
her
heart
be
full
,
and
her
eye
be
red
with
tear
;
but
it
be
so
long
since
she
have
be
in
his
house
that
she
be
more
than
ordinarily
anxious
not
to
appear
uncourteous
or
unkind
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
morning
,
doctor
,
"
she
say
,
change
her
countenance
as
best
she
may
,
and
attempt
a
smile

<EOS>
"
ah

my
fairy

<EOS>
"
say
he
,
leave
his
villainous
compound

come
out
to
her

you

too

be
about

old
lady

<EOS>

indeed

I

I
do
not

to
be
either
steady

old
for
the
next
ten
year

<EOS>
but
who
have
tell
you
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
Mary
have
be
a
traitor

"
  
<EOS>

well

I
will
confess

He

I
do

and
then
she
part
from
him
also
,
and
go
her
way
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
be
speak
of
that
evening
between
Dr

future
happiness

nothing

altogether
my

"
Uncle

as
she
say
this
,
she
put
down
the
cup

she
have
hold

,
lean
her
elbow
on
the
table

rest
her
forehead
on

and
would
you
be
happy

no

I
should

quieter

more
tranquil
elsewhere

here

<EOS>

I
also
sometimes
think

it
will
be
well
for
us
to
take
up
our
stave
and
walk
away
out
of
Greshamsbury
;
 
leave
it
altogether

settle
elsewhere

mile
,
mile
,
mile
away
from
here

Should
you
like
that
,
dear

"
  
<EOS>
mile
,
mile
,
mile
away
from
Greshamsbury
!
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
the
sound
that
fall
very
cold
on
Mary
's
ear
,
unhappy
as
she
be
.
<EOS>
Greshamsbury
have
be
so
dear
to
her
;
in
spite
of
all
that
have
pass
,
be
still
so
dear
to
her
!
<EOS>
be
she
prepare
to
take
up
her
staff
,
as
her
uncle
say
,
and
walk
forth
from
the
place
with
the
full
understanding
that
she
be
to
return
to
it
no
more
;
with
a
mind
resolve
that
there
should
be
an
inseparable
gulf
between
her
and
its
inhabitant
?
<EOS>
such
she
know
be
the
propose
nature
of
the
walking
away
of
which
her
uncle
speak
.
<EOS>
so
she
sit
there
,
rest
on
her
arm
,
and
give
no
answer
to
the
question
that
have
be
ask
her

<EOS>
"
no

we
will
stay
a
while
yet

say
her
uncle

"
It
may
come
to

then
he
go
on
for
a
moment
with
his
breakfast

She
sit
for
a
while
again
silent

collect
her
courage
on
the
subject

be
near
her
heart

<EOS>
She
would
have
give
the
world
that
he
should
ask
her
question

she
could
not
bid
him
to
do
so

she
find
it
impossible

talk
openly
to
him
about

up

find
that
the
will
leave
by
Sir
Roger
be
so
make
as
to
entail
upon
him
duty
that
he
would
find
it
almost
impossible
to
perform
.
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
,
though
his
father
have
wish
to
make
him
still
a
child
in
the
eye
of
the
law
,
be
no
child
.
<EOS>
He
know
his
own
right
and
be
determined
to
exact
them
;
and
before
Sir
Roger
have
be
dead
three
month
,
the
doctor
find
himself
in
continual
litigation
with
a
low
Barchester
attorney
,
who
be
act
on
behalf
of
his
,
the
doctor
's
,
own
ward
.
  
<EOS>
and
if
the
doctor
suffer
so
do
the
squire
,
and
so
do
those
who
have
hitherto
have
the
management
of
the
squire
's
affair
.
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
soon
perceive
that
he
be
to
be
drive
into
litigation
,
not
only
with
Mr
Finnie
,
the
Barchester
attorney
,
but
with
the
squire
himself
.
<EOS>
while
Finnie
harass
him
,
he
be
compel
to
harass
Mr
Gresham
.
<EOS>
He
be
no
lawyer
himself
;
and
though
he
have
be
able
to
manage
very
well
between
the
squire
and
Sir
Roger
,
and
have
perhaps
give
himself
some
credit
for
his
lawyer
-
like
ability
in
so
do
,
he
be
utterly
unable
to
manage
between
Sir
Louis
and
Mr
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
,
therefore
,
to
employ
a
lawyer
on
his
own
account
,
and
it
seem
probable
that
the
whole
amount
of
Sir
Roger
's
legacy
to
himself
would
by
degree
be
expend
in
this
manner
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
the
squire
's
lawyer
have
to
take
up
the
matter
;
and
they
do
so
greatly
to
the
detriment
of
poor
Mr
Yates
Umbleby
,
who
be
find
to
have
make
a
mess
of
the
affair
entrust
to
him
.
<EOS>
Mr
Umbleby
's
account
be
incorrect
;
his
mind
be
anything
but
clear
,
and
he
confess
,
when
put
to
it
by
the
very
sharp
gentleman
that
come
down
from
London
,
that
he
be
"
bother
;
"
and
so
,
after
a
while
,
he
be
suspend
from
his
duty
,
and
Mr
Gazebee
,
the
sharp
gentleman
from
London
,
reign
over
the
diminished
rent
-
roll
of
the
Greshamsbury
estate
.
  
<EOS>
thus
everything
be
go
wrong
at
Greshamsbury
 
with
the
one
exception
of
Mr
Oriel
and
his
love
-
suit
.
<EOS>
Miss
Gushing
attribute
the
deposition
of
Mr
Umbleby
to
the
narrowness
of
the
victory
which
Beatrice
have
win
in
carry
off
Mr
Oriel
.
<EOS>
for
Miss
Gushing
be
a
relation
of
the
Umblebys
,
and
have
be
for
many
year
one
of
their
family
.
<EOS>
"
if
she
have
only
choose
to
exert
herself
as
Miss
Gresham
have
do
,
she
could
have
have
Mr
Oriel
,
easily
;
oh
,
too
easily
!
<EOS>
but
she
have
despise
such
work
,
"
so
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
but
though
she
have
despise
it
,
the
Greshams
have
not
be
less
irritated
,
and
,
therefore
,
Mr
Umbleby
have
be
drive
out
of
his
house
.
<EOS>
"
We
can
hardly
believe
this
,
as
victory
generally
make
man
generous
.
<EOS>
Miss
Gushing
,
however
,
state
it
as
a
fact
so
often
that
it
be
probable
she
be
induce
to
believe
it
herself
.
  
<EOS>
thus
everything
be
go
wrong
at
Greshamsbury
,
and
the
squire
himself
be
especially
a
sufferer
.
<EOS>
Umbleby
have
at
any
rate
be
his
own
man
,
and
he
could
do
what
he
like
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
see
him
when
he
like
,
and
where
he
like
,
and
how
he
like
;
could
scold
him
if
in
an
ill
-
humour
,
and
laugh
at
him
when
in
a
good
humour
.
<EOS>
all
this
Mr
Umbleby
know
,
and
bore
.
<EOS>
but
Mr
Gazebee
be
a
very
different
sort
of
gentleman
;
he
be
the
junior
partner
in
the
firm
of
Gumption
,
Gazebee
&
Gazebee
,
of
Mount
Street
,
a
house
that
never
defile
itself
with
any
other
business
than
the
agency
business
,
and
that
in
the
very
high
line
.
<EOS>
They
draw
out
lease
,
and
manage
property
both
for
the
Duke
of
Omnium
and
Lord
de
Courcy
;
and
ever
since
her
marriage
,
it
have
be
one
of
the
object
dear
to
Lady
Arabella
's
heart
,
that
the
Greshamsbury
acre
should
be
superintend
by
the
polite
skill
and
polish
legal
ability
of
that
all
but
elegant
firm
in
Mount
Street
.
  
<EOS>
the
squire
have
long
stand
firm
,
and
have
delight
in
have
everything
do
under
his
own
eye
by
poor
Mr
Yates
Umbleby
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
alas
!
<EOS>
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
.
<EOS>
He
have
put
off
the
evil
day
as
long
as
he
could
;
he
have
defer
the
odious
work
of
investigation
till
thing
have
seem
resolve
on
investigate
themselves
;
and
then
,
when
it
be
absolutely
necessary
that
Mr
Umbleby
should
go
,
there
be
nothing
for
him
leave
but
to
fall
into
the
ready
hand
of
Messrs
Gumption
,
Gazebee
and
Gazebee
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
suppose
that
Messrs
Gumption
,
Gazebee
&
Gazebee
be
in
the
least
like
the
ordinary
run
of
attorney
.
<EOS>
They
write
no
letter
for
six
-
and
-
eightpence
each
:
they
collect
no
debt
,
file
no
bill
,
make
no
charge
per
folio
for
"
wherease
"
and
"
as
aforesaid
;
"
they
do
no
dirty
work
,
and
probably
be
as
ignorant
of
the
interior
of
a
court
of
law
as
any
young
lady
live
in
their
Mayfair
vicinity
.
<EOS>
no
;
their
business
be
to
manage
the
property
of
great
people
,
draw
up
lease
,
make
legal
assignment
,
get
the
family
marriage
settlement
make
,
and
look
after
will
.
<EOS>
occasionally
,
also
,
they
have
to
raise
money
;
but
it
be
generally
understand
that
this
be
do
by
proxy
.
  
<EOS>
the
firm
have
be
go
on
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
year
,
and
the
designation
have
often
be
alter
;
but
it
always
consist
of
Gumptions
and
Gazebees
differently
arrange
,
and
no
less
hallowed
name
have
ever
be
permit
to
appear
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
Gazebee
,
Gazebee
&
Gumption
;
then
Gazebee
&
Gumption
;
then
Gazebee
,
Gumption
&
Gumption
;
then
Gumption
,
Gumption
&
Gazebee
;
and
now
it
be
Gumption
,
Gazebee
&
Gazebee
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Gazebee
,
the
junior
member
of
this
firm
,
be
a
very
elegant
young
man
.
<EOS>
while
look
at
him
ride
in
Rotten
Row
,
you
would
hardly
have
take
him
for
an
attorney
;
and
have
he
hear
that
you
have
so
take
him
,
he
would
have
be
very
much
surprised
indeed
.
<EOS>
He
be
rather
bald
;
not
be
,
as
people
say
,
quite
so
young
as
he
be
once
.
<EOS>
His
exact
age
be
thirty
-
eight
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
a
really
remarkable
pair
of
jet
-
black
whisker
,
which
fully
make
up
for
any
deficiency
as
to
his
head
;
he
have
also
dark
eye
,
and
a
beak
nose
,
what
may
be
call
a
distinguished
mouth
,
and
be
always
dress
in
fashionable
attire
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
that
Mr
Mortimer
Gazebee
,
junior
partner
in
the
firm
Gumption
,
Gazebee
&
Gazebee
,
by
no
means
consider
himself
to
be
make
of
that
very
disagreeable
material
which
mortal
call
small
beer
.
  
<EOS>
when
this
great
firm
be
apply
to
,
to
get
Mr
Gresham
through
his
difficulty
,
and
when
the
state
of
his
affair
be
make
known
to
them
,
they
at
first
express
rather
a
disinclination
for
the
work
.
<EOS>
but
at
last
,
move
doubtless
by
their
respect
for
the
de
Courcy
interest
,
they
assent
;
and
Mr
Gazebee
,
junior
,
go
down
to
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
the
poor
squire
pass
many
a
sad
day
after
that
before
he
again
feel
himself
to
be
master
even
of
his
own
domain
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
when
Mr
Mortimer
Gazebee
visit
Greshamsbury
,
which
he
do
on
more
than
one
or
two
occasion
,
he
be
always
receive
_
en
grand
seigneur
_
.
<EOS>
to
Lady
Arabella
<EOS>
he
be
by
no
mean
an
unwelcome
guest
,
for
she
find
herself
able
,
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
,
to
speak
confidentially
on
her
husband
's
pecuniary
affair
with
the
man
who
have
the
management
of
her
husband
's
property
.
<EOS>
Mr
Gazebee
also
be
a
pet
with
Lady
de
Courcy
;
and
be
know
to
be
a
fashionable
man
in
London
,
and
quite
a
different
sort
of
person
from
poor
Mr
Umbleby
,
he
be
always
receive
with
smile
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
hundred
little
way
of
make
himself
agreeable
,
and
Augusta
declare
to
her
cousin
,
the
Lady
Amelia
,
after
have
be
acquaint
with
him
for
a
few
month
,
that
he
would
be
a
perfect
gentleman
,
only
,
that
his
family
have
never
be
anything
but
attorney
.
<EOS>
the
Lady
Amelia
smile
in
her
own
peculiarly
aristocratic
way
,
shrug
her
shoulder
slightly
,
and
say
,
"
that
Mr
Mortimer
Gazebee
be
a
very
good
sort
of
a
person
,
very
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
Augusta
feel
herself
snub
,
think
perhaps
of
the
tailor
's
son
;
but
as
there
be
never
any
appeal
against
the
Lady
Amelia
,
she
say
nothing
more
at
that
moment
in
favour
of
Mr
Mortimer
Gazebee
.
  
<EOS>
all
these
evil
 
<EOS>
Mr
Mortimer
Gazebee
be
the
bad
of
them
 
<EOS>
have
Sir
Louis
Scatcherd
bring
down
on
the
poor
squire
's
head
.
<EOS>
there
may
be
those
who
will
say
that
the
squire
have
bring
them
on
himself
,
by
run
into
debt
;
and
so
,
doubtless
,
he
have
;
but
it
be
not
the
less
true
that
the
baronet
's
interference
be
unnecessary
,
vexatious
,
and
one
may
almost
say
,
malicious
.
<EOS>
His
interest
would
have
be
quite
safe
in
the
doctor
's
hand
,
and
he
have
,
in
fact
,
no
legal
right
to
meddle
;
but
neither
the
doctor
nor
the
squire
could
prevent
him
.
<EOS>
Mr
Finnie
know
very
well
what
he
be
about
,
if
Sir
Louis
do
not
;
and
so
the
three
go
on
,
each
with
his
own
lawyer
,
and
each
of
them
distrustful
,
unhappy
,
and
ill
at
ease
.
<EOS>
this
be
hard
upon
the
doctor
,
for
he
be
not
in
debt
,
and
have
borrow
no
money
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
not
much
reason
to
suppose
that
the
visit
of
Sir
Louis
to
Greshamsbury
would
much
improve
matter
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
presume
that
he
be
not
come
with
any
amicable
view
,
but
with
the
object
rather
of
look
after
his
own
;
a
phrase
which
be
now
constantly
in
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
He
may
probably
find
it
necessary
while
look
after
his
own
at
Greshamsbury
,
to
say
some
very
disagreeable
thing
to
the
squire
;
and
the
doctor
,
therefore
,
hardly
expect
that
the
visit
would
go
off
pleasantly
.
  
<EOS>
when
last
we
see
Sir
Louis
,
now
nearly
twelve
month
since
,
he
be
intent
on
make
a
proposal
of
marriage
to
Miss
Thorne
.
<EOS>
this
intention
he
carry
out
about
two
day
after
Frank
Gresham
have
do
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
He
have
delay
do
so
till
he
have
succeed
in
purchase
his
friend
Jenkins
's
arab
pony
,
imagine
that
such
a
present
could
not
but
go
far
in
wean
Mary
's
heart
from
her
other
lover
.
<EOS>
poor
Mary
be
put
to
the
trouble
of
refuse
both
the
baronet
and
the
pony
,
and
a
very
bad
time
she
have
of
it
while
do
so
.
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
be
a
man
easily
anger
,
and
not
very
easily
pacify
,
and
Mary
have
to
endure
a
good
deal
of
annoyance
;
from
any
other
person
,
indeed
,
she
would
have
call
it
impertinence
.
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
,
however
,
have
to
bear
his
rejection
as
best
he
could
,
and
,
after
a
perseverance
of
three
day
,
return
to
London
in
disgust
;
and
Mary
have
not
see
him
since
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Greyson
's
first
letter
be
follow
by
a
second
;
and
the
second
be
follow
by
the
baronet
in
person
.
<EOS>
He
also
require
to
be
receive
_
en
grand
seigneur
_
,
perhaps
more
imperatively
than
Mr
Mortimer
Gazebee
himself
.
<EOS>
He
come
with
four
poster
from
the
Barchester
Station
,
and
have
himself
rattle
up
to
the
doctor
's
door
in
a
way
that
take
the
breath
away
from
all
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
why
!
<EOS>
the
squire
himself
for
a
many
long
year
have
be
content
to
come
home
with
a
pair
of
horse
;
and
four
be
never
see
in
the
place
,
except
when
the
de
Courcys
come
to
Greshamsbury
,
or
Lady
Arabella
with
all
her
daughter
return
from
her
hard
-
fight
metropolitan
campaign
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
,
however
,
come
with
four
,
and
very
arrogant
he
look
,
lean
back
in
the
barouche
belong
to
the
George
and
Dragon
,
and
wrap
up
in
fur
,
although
it
be
now
midsummer
.
<EOS>
and
up
in
the
dicky
behind
be
a
servant
,
more
arrogant
,
if
possible
,
than
his
master
 
<EOS>
the
baronet
's
own
man
,
who
be
the
object
of
Dr
Thorne
's
special
detestation
and
disgust
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
little
fellow
,
choose
originally
on
account
of
his
light
weight
on
horseback
;
but
if
that
may
be
consider
a
merit
,
it
be
the
only
one
he
have
.
<EOS>
His
out
-
door
show
dress
be
a
little
tight
frock
-
coat
,
round
which
a
polished
strap
be
always
buckle
tightly
,
a
stiff
white
choker
,
leather
breech
,
top
-
boot
,
and
a
hat
,
with
a
cockade
,
stick
on
one
side
of
his
head
.
<EOS>
His
name
be
Jonah
,
which
his
master
and
his
master
's
friend
shorten
into
Joe
;
none
,
however
,
but
those
who
be
very
intimate
with
his
master
be
allow
to
do
so
with
impunity
.
  
<EOS>
this
Joe
be
Dr
Thorne
's
special
aversion
.
<EOS>
in
his
anxiety
to
take
every
possible
step
to
keep
Sir
Louis
from
poison
himself
,
he
have
at
first
attempt
to
enlist
the
baronet
's
"
own
man
"
in
the
cause
.
<EOS>
Joe
have
promise
fairly
,
but
have
betray
the
doctor
at
once
,
and
have
become
the
bad
instrument
of
his
master
's
dissipation
.
<EOS>
when
,
therefore
,
his
hat
and
the
cockade
be
see
,
as
the
carriage
dash
up
to
the
door
,
the
doctor
's
contentment
be
by
no
means
increase
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
be
now
twenty
-
three
year
old
,
and
be
a
great
deal
too
know
to
allow
himself
to
be
keep
under
the
doctor

thumb

<EOS>
It
have
,
indeed
,
become
his
plan
to
rebel
against
his
guardian
in
almost
everything
.
<EOS>
He
have
at
first
be
decently
submissive
,
with
the
view
of
obtain
increase
supply
of
ready
money
;
but
he
have
be
sharp
enough
to
perceive
<EOS>
that
,
let
his
conduct
be
what
it
would
,
the
doctor
would
keep
him
out
of
debt
;
but
that
the
do
so
take
so
large
a
sum
that
he
could
not
hope
for
any
further
advance
.
<EOS>
in
this
respect
Sir
Louis
be
perhaps
more
keen
-
witted
than
Dr
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
,
when
she
see
the
carriage
,
at
once
run
up
to
her
own
bedroom
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
who
have
be
with
her
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
go
down
to
meet
his
ward
,
but
as
soon
as
he
see
the
cockade
he
dart
almost
involuntarily
into
his
shop
and
shut
the
door
.
<EOS>
this
protection
,
however
,
last
only
for
a
moment
;
he
feel
that
decency
require
him
to
meet
his
guest
,
and
so
he
go
forth
and
face
the
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
say
Joe
,
speak
to
Janet
,
who
stand
curtsy
at
the
gate
,
with
Bridget
,
the
other
maid
,
behind
her
,
"
I
say
,
be
there
any
chap
about
the
place
to
take
these
thing
 
eh
?
<EOS>
come
,
look
sharp
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
so
happen
that
the
doctor
's
groom
be
not
on
the
spot
,
and
"
other
chap
"
the
doctor
have
none
.
  
<EOS>
"
take
those
thing
,
Bridget
,
"
he
say
,
come
forward
and
offer
his
hand
to
the
baronet
.
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
,
when
he
see
his
host
,
rouse
himself
slowly
from
the
back
of
his
carriage
.
<EOS>
"
how
do
,
doctor
?
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
terrible
bad
road
you
have
here
!
<EOS>
and
,
upon
my
word
,
it
be
as
cold
as
winter
:
"
and
,
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
slowly
proceed
to
descend
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
be
a
year
old
than
when
we
last
see
him
,
and
,
in
his
generation
,
a
year
wise
.
<EOS>
He
have
then
be
somewhat
humble
before
the
doctor
;
but
now
he
be
determined
to
let
his
guardian
see
that
he
know
how
to
act
the
baronet
;
that
he
have
acquire
the
manner
of
a
great
man
;
and
that
he
be
not
to
be
put
upon
.
<EOS>
He
have
learn
some
lesson
from
Jenkins
,
in
London
,
and
other
friend
of
the
same
sort
,
and
he
be
about
to
profit
by
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
show
him
to
his
room
,
and
then
proceed
to
ask
after
his
health
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
I
be
right
enough
,
"
say
Sir
Louis
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
believe
all
that
fellow
Greyson
tell
you
:
he
want
me
to
take
salt
and
senna
,
opodeldoc
,
and
all
that
sort
of
stuff
;
look
after
his
bill
,
you
know
 
eh
?
<EOS>
like
all
the
rest
of
you
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
have
it
;
 
not
at
any
price
;
and
then
he
write
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
to
see
you
able
to
travel
,
"
say
Dr
Thorne
,
who
could
not
force
himself
to
tell
his
guest
that
he
be
glad
to
see
him
at
Greshamsbury
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
travel
;
yes
,
I
can
travel
well
enough
.
<EOS>
but
I
wish
you
have
some
well
sort
of
trap
down
in
these
country
part
.
<EOS>
I
be
shake
to
bit
.
<EOS>
and
,
doctor
,
would
you
tell
your
people
to
send
that
fellow
of
mine
up
here
with
hot
water
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
dismiss
,
the
doctor
go
his
way
,
and
meet
Joe
swagger
in
one
of
the
passage
,
while
Janet
and
her
colleague
drag
along
between
them
a
heavy
article
of
baggage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Janet
,
"
say
he
,
"
go
downstairs
and
get
Sir
Louis
some
hot
water
,
and
Joe
,
do
you
take
hold
of
your
master
's
portmanteau
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Joe
sulkily
do
as
he
be
bid
.
<EOS>
"
seem
to
me
,
"
say
he
,
turn
to
the
girl
,
and
speak
before
the
doctor
be
out
of
hearing
<EOS>
,
"
seem
to
me
,
my
dear
,
you
be
rather
short
-
handed
here
;
lot
of
work
and
nothing
to
get
;
that
be
about
the
ticket
,
be
not
it
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Bridget
be
too
demurely
modest
to
make
any
answer
upon
<EOS>
so
short
an
acquaintance
<EOS>
;
so
,
put
her
end
of
the
burden
down
at
the
strange
gentleman
's
door
,
she
retreat
into
the
kitchen
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
,
in
answer
to
the
doctor
's
inquiry
,
have
declare
himself
to
be
all
right
;
but
his
appearance
be
anything
but
all
right
.
<EOS>
twelve
month
since
,
a
life
of
dissipation
,
or
rather
,
perhaps
,
a
life
of
drinking
,
have
not
have
upon
him
so
strong
an
effect
but
that
some
of
the
salt
of
youth
be
still
leave
;
some
of
the
freshness
of
young
year
may
still
be
see
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
now
all
go
;
his
eye
be
sink
and
watery
,
his
cheek
be
hollow
and
wan
,
his
mouth
be
draw
and
his
lip
dry
;
his
back
be
even
bent
,
and
his
leg
be
unsteady
under
him
,
so
that
he
have
be
force
to
step
down
from
his
carriage
as
an
old
man
would
do
.
<EOS>
alas
,
alas
!
<EOS>
he
have
no
further
chance
now
of
ever
be
all
right
again
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
have
seclude
herself
in
her
bedroom
as
soon
as
the
carriage
have
drive
up
to
the
door
,
and
there
she
remain
till
dinner
-
time
.
<EOS>
but
she
could
not
shut
herself
up
altogether
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
necessary
that
she
should
appear
at
dinner
;
and
,
therefore
,
a
few
minute
before
the
hour
,
she
creep
out
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
as
she
open
the
door
,
she
look
in
timidly
,
expect
Sir
Louis
to
be
there
;
but
when
she
see
that
her
uncle
be
the
only
occupant
of
the
room
,
her
brow
clear
,
and
she
enter
with
a
quick
step
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
come
down
to
dinner
;
will
not
he
,
uncle
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
suppose
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
he
do
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
dressing

I
suppose

he

at
it

hour

but
,
uncle
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
well

"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
he
come
up
after
dinner
,
do
you
think

"
  
<EOS>
Mary
speak
of
him
as
though
he
be
some
wild
beast
,
whom
her
uncle
insist
on
have
in
his
house

<EOS>
"
goodness
know

up

<EOS>
yes

He
will
not
stay
in
the
dining

room
all
night

"
  
<EOS>
"

,
dear
uncle

do
be
serious

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
serious
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
serious
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
that
I
may
go
to
bed
,
instead
of
wait
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
be
save
the
trouble
of
answer
by
the
entrance
of
the
baronet
.
<EOS>
He
be
dressed
in
what
he
consider
the
most
fashionable
style
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
He
have
on
a
new
dress
-
coat
line
with
satin
,
new
dress
-
trouser
,
a
silk
waistcoat
cover
with
chain
,
a
white
cravat
,
polished
pump
,
and
silk
stocking
,
and
he
carry
a
scented
handkerchief
in
his
hand
;
he
have
ring
on
his
finger
,
and
carbuncle
stud
in
his
shirt
,
and
he
smell
as
sweet
as
patchouli
could
make
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
hardly
do
more
than
shuffle
into
the
room
,
and
seem
almost
to
drag
one
of
his
leg
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
,
in
spite
of
her
aversion
,
be
shock
and
distressed
when
she
see
him
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
seem
to
think
himself
perfect
,
and
be
no
whit
abash
by
the
unfavourable
reception
which
twelve
month
since
have
be
pay
to
his
suit
.
<EOS>
Mary
come
up
and
shake
hand
with
him
,
and
he
receive
her
with
a
compliment
which
no
doubt
he
think
must
be
acceptable
.
"
<EOS>
upon
my
word
,
Miss
Thorne
,
every
place
seem
to
agree
with
you
;
one
well
than
another
.
<EOS>
You
be
look
charming
at
Boxall
Hill
;
but
,
upon
my
word
,
charming
be
not
half
strong
enough
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
sit
down
quietly
,
and
the
doctor
assume
a
face
of
unutterable
disgust
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
creature
for
whom
all
his
sympathy
have
be
demand
,
all
his
good
energy
put
in
requisition
;
on
whose
behalf
he
be
to
quarrel
with
his
old
friend
,
lose
his
peace
and
quietness
of
life
,
and
exercise
all
the
function
of
a
loving
friend
!
<EOS>
this
be
his
self
-
invite
guest
,
whom
he
be
bind
to
foster
,
and
whom
he
could
not
turn
from
his
door
.
  
<EOS>
then
dinner
come
,
and
Mary
have
to
put
her
hand
upon
his
arm
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
do
not
lean
upon
him
,
and
once
or
twice
feel
inclined
to
give
him
some
support
.
<EOS>
They
reach
the
dining
-
room
,
however
,
the
doctor
follow
them
,
and
then
sit
down
,
Janet
wait
in
the
room
,
as
be
usual
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
doctor

say
the
baronet

have
not
my
man
better
come
in
and
help
?

He
be
get
nothing
to
do

<EOS>
We
should
be
more
cosy
,
should
not
we
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Janet
will
manage
pretty
well
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
you
would
better
have
Joe
;
there
be
nothing
like
a
good
servant
at
table
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
Janet
,
just
send
that
fellow
in
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
do
very
well
without
him
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
become
rather
red
about
the
cheek
-
bone
,
and
with
a
slight
gleam
of
determination
about
the
eye
.
<EOS>
Janet
,
who
see
how
matter
stand
,
make
no
attempt
to
obey
the
baronet
's
order
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
nonsense
,
doctor
<EOS>
;
you
think
he
be
an
uppish
sort
of
fellow
,
I
know
,
and
you
do
not
like
to
trouble
him
;
but
when
I
be
near
him
,
he
be
all
right
;
just
send
him
in
,
will
you
?

<EOS>
"
Sir
Louis
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
I
be
accustomed
to
none
but
my
own
old
woman
here
in
my
own
house

and
if
you
will
allow
me
,
I
will
keep
my
old
way

I
shall
be
sorry

<EOS>
the
baronet
say
nothing
more
,
and
the
dinner
pass
off
slowly
and
wearily
enough
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mary
have
eat
her
fruit
and
escape
,
the
doctor
get
into
one
arm
-
chair
and
the
baronet
into
another
,
and
the
latter
begin
the
only
work
of
existence
of
which
he
know
anything
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
good
port

he

very
fair
port

<EOS>
the
doctor
love
his
port
wine
,
and
thaw
a
little
in
his
manner
.
<EOS>
He
love
it
not
as
a
toper
,
but
as
a
collector
love
his
pet
picture
.
<EOS>
He
like
to
talk
about
it
,
and
think
about
it
;
to
praise
it
,
and
hear
it
praise
;
to
look
at
it
turn
towards
the
light
,
and
to
count
over
the
year
it
have
lain
in
his
cellar
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
he
,
"
it
be
pretty
fair
wine

<EOS>
It
be
,
at

,
when
I
get
it
,
twenty
year
ago
,
and
I
do
not
suppose
time
have
hurt
it

and
he
hold
the
glass
up
to
the
window
,
and
look
at
the
evening
light
through
the
ruby
tint
of
the
liquid
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
dear
,
there
be
not
much
of
it
leave

more
be
the
pity

"
a
good
thing
will
not

I
will
tell
you
what
now

would
bring
down
a
dozen

two
of
claret

I

some
prime
stuff
in
London

get
it
from
Muzzle

at
ninety

six
shilling

send
up
for

dozen

I

you
out

high

<EOS>
the
doctor
freeze
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

I
need
trouble
you

he
;

"
I
never
drink
claret

at

not
here

there

<EOS>
Sir
Louis
drink
two

three
glass
of
wine
very
quickly
after
each
other
,
and
they
immediately
begin
to
tell
upon
his
weak
stomach

<EOS>
but
before
he
be
tipsy

he
become
more

more
disagreeable

interest

yes

how

<EOS>
and
then
,
get
up
,
to
avoid
the
flood
he
himself
have
cause
,
he
nearly
fall
into
the
doctor
's
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
tired
with
your
journey
,
Sir
Louis
;
perhaps
you
would
better
go
to
bed
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
be
a
bit
seedy

so

<EOS>
those

road
of
yours

shake
a
fellow
so

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
ring
the
bell
,
and
,
on
this
occasion
,
do
request
that
Joe
may
be
send
for
.
<EOS>
Joe
come
in
,
and
,
though
he
be
much
steady
than
his
master
,
look
as
though
he
also
have
find
some
bin
of
which
he
have
approve
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Louis
wish
to
go
to
bed
,
"
say
the
doctor
;
"
you
have
better
give
him
your
arm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
;
in
course
I
will
,
"
say
Joe
,
stand
immoveable
<EOS>
about
half
-
way
between
the
door
and
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
just
take
one
more
glass
of
the
old
port
 
eh
,
doctor
?
"
say
Sir
Louis
,
put
out
his
hand
and
clutch
the
decanter
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
hard
for
any
man
to
deny
his
guest
in
his
own
house
,
and
the
doctor
,
at
the
moment
,
do
not
know
how
to
do
it
;
so
Sir
Louis
get
his
wine
,
after
pour
half
of
it
over
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
in
,
sir
,
and
give
Sir
Louis
your
arm
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
angrily
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
will
in
course
,
if
my
master
tell
me
;
but
,
if
you
please
,
Dr
Thorne
,
"
 
and
Joe
put
his
hand
up
to
his
hair
in
a
manner
that
have
a
great
deal
more
of
impudence
than
reverence
in
it
 
<EOS>
"
I
just
want
to
ax
one
question
:
<EOS>
where
be
I
to
sleep
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
now
this
be
a
question
which
the
doctor
be
not
prepared
to
answer
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
,
however
well
Janet
or
Mary
may
have
be
able
to
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
sleep
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
do
not
know
where
you
be
to
sleep

do
not
care

ask
Janet

<EOS>
"
that
be
all
very
well

"
hold
your

Sir
Louis
.
<EOS>
"
what
the
devil
do
you
want
of
sleep
?
 
<EOS>
come
here
,
"
and
then
,
with
his
servant
's
help
,
he
make
his
way
up
to
his
bedroom
,
and
be
no
more
hear
of
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
he
get
tipsy
,
"
ask
Mary
,
almost
in
a
whisper
,
when
her
uncle
join
her
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
talk

it
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
poor
wretch

<EOS>
poor
wretch
!
<EOS>
let
's
have
some
tea
now
,
Molly
,
and
pray
do
not
talk
any
more
about
him
to
-
night
.
"
<EOS>
then
Mary
do
make
the
tea
,
and
do
not
talk
any
more
about
Sir
Louis
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
what
on
earth
be
they
to
do
with
him
?
<EOS>
He
have
come
there
self
-
invite
;
but
his
connexion
with
the
doctor
be
such
,
that
it
be
impossible
he
should
be
tell
to
go
away
,
either
he
himself
,
or
that
servant
of
his
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
reason
to
disbelieve
him
when
he
declare
that
he
have
come
down
to
ferret
out
the
squire
.
<EOS>
such
be
,
doubtless
,
<EOS>
his
intention
.
<EOS>
He
would
ferret
out
the
squire
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
may
ferret
out
Lady
Arabella
also
.
<EOS>
Frank
would
be
home
in
a
few
day
;
and
he
,
too
,
may
be
ferret
out
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
matter
take
a
very
singular
turn
,
and
one
quite
unexpected
on
the
doctor
's
part
.
<EOS>
on
the
morning
follow
the
little
dinner
of
which
we
have
speak
,
one
of
the
Greshamsbury
groom
ride
up
to
the
doctor
's
door
with
two
note
.
<EOS>
one
be
address
to
the
doctor
in
the
squire
's
well
-
know
large
handwriting
,
and
the
other
be
for
Sir
Louis
.
<EOS>
each
contain
an
invitation
do
dinner
for
the
follow
day
;
and
that
to
the
doctor
be
in
this
wise
:
    
DEAR
DOCTOR
,
  
do
come
and
dine
here
to
-
morrow
,
and
bring
Sir
Louis
Scatcherd
with
you
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
the
man
I
take
you
to
be
,
you
will
not
refuse
me
.
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
send
a
note
for
Sir
Louis
.
<EOS>
there
will
be
nobody
here
but
Oriel
,
and
Mr
Gazebee
,
who
be
stay
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
yours
ever
,
  
F.
N.
GRESHAM
.
  
<EOS>
Greshamsbury
,
July
,
185
 
.
  
<EOS>
P.S.
 
<EOS>
I
make
a
positive
request
that
you
will
come
,
and
I
think
you
will
hardly
refuse
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
read
it
twice
before
he
could
believe
it
,
and
then
order
Janet
to
take
the
other
note
up
to
Sir
Louis
.
<EOS>
as
these
invitation
be
rather
in
opposition
to
the
then
exist
Greshamsbury
tactic
,
the
cause
of
Lady
Arabella
's
special
civility
must
be
explain
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Mortimer
Gazebee
be
now
at
the
house
,
and
therefore
,
it
must
be
presume
,
that
thing
be
not
allow
to
go
on
after
their
old
fashion
.
<EOS>
Mr
Gazebee
be
an
acute
as
well
as
a
fashionable
man
;
one
who
know
what
he
be
about
,
and
who
,
moreover
,
have
determine
to
give
his
very
good
effort
on
behalf
of
the
Greshamsbury
property
.
<EOS>
His
energy
,
in
this
respect
,
will
explain
itself
hereafter
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
probable
that
the
arrival
in
the
village
of
such
a
person
as
Sir
Louis
Scatcherd
should
escape
attention
.
<EOS>
He
have
hear
of
it
before
dinner
,
and
,
before
the
evening
be
over
,
have
discuss
it
with
Lady
Arabella
.
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
be
not
at
first
inclined
to
make
much
of
Sir
Louis
,
and
express
herself
as
but
little
inclined
to
agree
with
Mr
Gazebee
when
that
gentleman
suggest
that
he
should
be
treat
with
civility
at
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
at
last
talk
over
.
<EOS>
She
find
it
pleasant
enough
to
have
more
to
do
with
the
secret
management
of
the
estate
than
Mr
Gresham
himself
;
and
when
Mr
Gazebee
prove
to
her
,
by
sundry
nod
and
winks
,
and
subtle
allusion
to
her
own
infinite
good
sense
,
that
it
be
necessary
to
catch
this
obscene
bird
which
have
come
to
prey
upon
the
estate
,
by
throw
a
little
salt
upon
his
tail
,
she
also
nod
and
wink
,
and
direct
Augusta
to
prepare
the
salt
accord
to
order
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
will
not
it
be
odd
,
Mr
Gazebee
,
ask
him
out
of
Dr
Thorne
's
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
we
must
have
the
doctor
,
too
,
Lady
Arabella
;
by
all
mean
ask
the
doctor
also
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
's
brow
grow
dark
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Gazebee
,
"
she
say
,
"
you
can
hardly
believe
how
that
man
have
behave
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
altogether
beneath
your
anger
,
"
say
Mr
Gazebee
,
with
a
bow
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
:
in
one
way
he
may
be
,
but
not
in
another
.
<EOS>
I
really
do
not
think
I
can
sit
down
to
table
with
Doctor
Thorne
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
Mr
Gazebee
gain
his
point
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
about
a
week
since
Sir
Omicron
Pie
have
be
at
Greshamsbury
,
and
the
squire
have
,
almost
daily
,
speak
to
his
wife
as
to
that
learned
man
's
advice
.
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
always
answer
in
the
same
tone
:
"
You
can
hardly
know
,
Mr
Gresham
,
how
that
man
have
insult
me
.
"
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
the
physician
's
advice
have
not
be
disbelieve
:
it
tally
too
well
with
her
own
inward
conviction
.
<EOS>
She
be
anxious
enough
to
have
Doctor
Thorne
back
at
her
bedside
,
if
she
could
only
get
him
there
without
damage
to
her
pride
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
,
she
think
,
may
probably
send
the
doctor
there
without
absolute
permission
from
herself
;
in
which
case
she
would
have
be
able
to
scold
,
and
show
that
she
be
offend
;
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
profit
by
what
have
be
do
.
<EOS>
but
Mr
Gresham
never
think
of
take
so
violent
a
step
as
this
,
and
,
therefore
,
Dr
Fillgrave
still
come
,
and
her
ladyship
's
_
finesse
_
be
waste
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mr
Gazebee
's
proposition
open
a
door
by
which
her
point
may
be
gain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
"
say
she
,
at
last
,
with
infinite
self
-
denial
,
"
if
you
think
it
be
for
Mr
Gresham
's
advantage
,
and
if
he
choose
to
ask
Dr
Thorne
,
I
will
not
refuse
to
receive
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Gazebee
's
next
task
be
to
discuss
the
matter
with
the
squire
.
<EOS>
nor
be
this
easy
,
for
Mr
Gazebee
be
no
favourite
with
Mr
Gresham
.
<EOS>
but
the
task
be
at
last
perform
successfully
.
<EOS>
Mr
Gresham
be
so
glad
at
heart
to
find
himself
able
,
once
more
,
to
ask
his
old
friend
to
his
own
house
;
and
,
though
it
would
have
please
him
better
that
this
sign
of
relent
on
his
wife
's
part
should
have
reach
him
by
other
mean
,
he
do
not
refuse
to
take
advantage
of
it
;
and
so
he
write
the
above
letter
to
Dr
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
as
we
have
say
,
read
it
twice
;
and
he
at
once
resolve
stoutly
that
he
would
not
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
do
,
do
go
!
"
say
Mary
.
<EOS>
She
well
know
how
wretched
this
feud
have
make
her
uncle
.
<EOS>
"
pray
,
pray
go
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
I
will
not
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
some
thing
a
man
should
bear
,
and
some
he
should
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
go
,
"
say
Mary
,
who
have
take
the
note
from
her
uncle
's
hand
,
and
read
it
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
refuse
him
when
he
ask
you
like
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
greatly
grieve
me
;
but
I
must
refuse
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
also
be
angry
,
uncle
;
very
angry
with
Lady
Arabella
;
but
for
him
,
for
the
squire
,
I
would
go
to
him
on
my
knee
if
he
ask
me
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
and
have
he
ask
you
,
I
also
would
have
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
now
I
shall
be
so
wretched
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
invitation
,
not
her
:
<EOS>
Mr
Gresham
could
not
ask
me
.
<EOS>
as
for
her
,
do
not
think
of
her
;
but
do
,
do
go
when
he
ask
you
like
that
.
<EOS>
You
will
make
me
so
miserable
if
you
do
not
.
<EOS>
and
then
Sir
Louis
can
not
go
without
you
,
"
 
and
Mary
point
upstairs
 
"
<EOS>
and
you
may
be
sure
that
he
will
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
and
make
a
beast
of
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
colloquy
be
cut
short
by
a
message
pray
the
doctor
to
go
up
to
Sir
Louis
's
room
.
<EOS>
the
young
man
be
sit
in
his
dressing
-
gown
,
drink
a
cup
of
coffee
at
his
toilet
-
table
,
while
Joe
be
prepare
his
razor
and
hot
water
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
's
nose
immediately
tell
him
that
there
be
more
in
the
coffee
-
cup
than
have
come
out
of
his
own
kitchen
,
and
he
would
not
let
the
offence
pass
unnoticed
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
take
brandy
this
morning
,
Sir
Louis
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
just
a
little

chasse

café

say
he
,
not
exactly
understand
the
word
he
use
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
the
go
now

a
capital
thing
for
the
stomach

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It

about
the

"
  
<EOS>
"
never
mind
about
that
now

look
here

this
be
what
we
call
the
civil

he
show
the
Greshamsbury
note

not

what

lot

the
doctor
take
the
note
and
read
it

It
be
civil

he
;

very
civil

I

<EOS>

and
you
will
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
not

that

,
Sir
Louis
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
well
!
eh
!
<EOS>
what
be
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
step
downstairs
a
moment
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
turn
to
the
servant
,
"
and
wait
till
you
be
call
for
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
speak
to
your

"
<EOS>
Joe
,
for
a
moment
,
look
up
at
the
baronet
's
face
,
as
though
he
want
but
the
slight
encouragement
to
disobey
the
doctor
's
order
;
but
not
see
it
,
he
slowly
retire
,
and
place
himself
,
of
course
,
at
the
keyhole
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
,
the
doctor
begin
a
long
and
very
useless
lecture
.
<EOS>
the
first
object
of
it
be
to
induce
his
ward
not
to
get
drunk
at
Greshamsbury
;
but
have
get
so
far
,
he
go
on
,
and
do
succeed
in
frighten
his
unhappy
guest
.
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
do
not
possess
the
iron
nerve
of
his
father
 
nerve
which
even
brandy
have
not
be
able
to
subdue
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
speak
strongly
,
very
strongly
;
speak
of
quick
,
almost
immediate
death
in
case
of
further
excess
;
speak
to
him
of
the
certainty
there
would
be
that
he
could
not
live
to
dispose
of
his
own
property
if
he
could
not
refrain
.
<EOS>
and
thus
he
do
frighten
Sir
Louis
.
<EOS>
the
father
he
have
never
be
able
to
frighten
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
man
who
,
though
they
fear
death
hugely
<EOS>
,
fear
present
suffer
more
;
who
,
indeed
,
will
not
bear
a
moment
of
pain
if
there
by
any
mode
of
escape
.
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
be
such
:
he
have
no
strength
of
nerve
,
no
courage
,
no
ability
to
make
a
resolution
and
keep
it
.
<EOS>
He
promise
the
doctor
that
he
would
refrain
;
and
,
as
he
do
so
,
he
swallow
down
his
cup
of
coffee
and
brandy
,
in
which
the
two
article
bear
about
equal
proportion
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
do
,
at
last
,
make
up
his
mind
to
go
.
<EOS>
whichever
way
he
determine
,
he
find
that
he
be
not
content
with
himself
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
like
to
trust
Sir
Louis
by
himself
,
and
he
do
not
like
to
show
that
he
be
angry
.
<EOS>
still
less
do
he
like
the
idea
of
break
bread
in
Lady
Arabella
's
house
till
some
amend
have
be
make
to
Mary
.
<EOS>
but
his
heart
would
not
allow
him
to
refuse
the
petition
contain
in
the
squire
's
postscript
,
and
the
matter
end
in
his
accept
the
invitation
.
  
<EOS>
this
visit
of
his
ward
's
be
,
in
every
way
,
pernicious
to
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
go
about
his
business
,
fear
to
leave
such
a
man
alone
with
Mary
.
<EOS>
on
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
,
she
escape
to
the
parsonage
for
an
hour
or
so
,
and
then
walk
away
among
the
lane
,
call
on
some
of
her
old
friend
among
the
farmer
"
wife
.
<EOS>
but
even
then
,
the
doctor
be
afraid
to
leave
Sir
Louis
.
<EOS>
what
could
such
a
man
do
,
leave
alone
in
a
village
like
Greshamsbury
?
<EOS>
so
he
stay
at
home
,
and
the
two
together
go
over
their
account
.
<EOS>
the
baronet
be
particular
about
his
account
,
and
say
a
good
deal
as
to
have
Finnie
over
to
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
to
this
,
however
,
Dr
Thorne
positively
refuse
his
consent
.
  
<EOS>
the
evening
pass
off
better
than
the
precede
one
;
at
least
the
early
part
of
it
.
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
do
not
get
tipsy
;
he
come
up
to
tea
,
and
Mary
,
who
do
not
feel
so
keenly
on
the
subject
as
her
uncle
,
almost
wish
that
he
have
do
so
.
<EOS>
at
ten
o'clock
he
go
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
but
after
that
new
trouble
come
on
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
have
go
downstairs
into
his
study
to
make
up
some
of
the
time
which
he
have
lose
,
and
have
just
seat
himself
at
his
desk
,
when
Janet
,
without
announce
herself
,
burst
into
the
room
;
and
Bridget
,
dissolve
in
hysterical
tear
,
with
her
apron
to
her
eye
,
appear
behind
the
senior
domestic
.
  
<EOS>
"
please
,
sir
,
"
say
Janet
,
drive
by
excitement
much
beyond
her
usual
pace
of
speak
,
and
become
unintentionally
a
little
less
respectful
than
usual
,
"
please
sir
,
that

ere

go
out

house

<EOS>
"

Tan't

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
if
Tummas

he
would
not
have
dare
;
so
he
would
not

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thomas
be
the
groom
,
and
,
if
all
Greshamsbury
report
be
true
,
it
be
probable
,
that
on
some
happy
,
future
day
,
Thomas
and
Bridget
would
become
one
flesh
and
one
bone
.
  
<EOS>
"
please
sir

"
continue
Janet
,
"
there
will
be
bad
work
here
if

house
this
very
night
,
and
I
be
sorry
to
trouble

and
so
I
be
.
<EOS>
but
Tom

he
be
give
to
fight
a'most
for
nothing

<EOS>
He
be
hout
now
;
but
if
that
there
young
man
be
be
here
<EOS>
when
Tom
come
home
,
Tom
will
be
punch
his
head
;
I
know
he
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
would
not
stand
by
and
see
a
poor
girl
put
upon
;
no
more
he
would
not
,
"
say
Bridget
,
through
her
tear
.
  
<EOS>
after
many
futile
inquiry
,
the
doctor
ascertain
that
Mr
Jonah
have
express
some
admiration
for
Bridget
's
youthful
charm
,
and
have
,
in
the
absence
of
Janet
,
throw
himself
at
the
lady

foot
in
a
manner
which
have
not
be
altogether
pleasing
to
her

<EOS>
She
have
defend
herself
stoutly
and
loudly
,
and
in
the
middle
of
the
row
Janet
have
come
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
where
be
he
now
?
"
say
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
sir
,
"
say
Janet
,
"
the
poor
girl
be
so
put
about
that
she
do
give
him
one
touch
across
the
face
with
the
rolling

pin
,
and
he
be
all
bloody
now
,
in
the
back
kitchen
.
"
<EOS>
at
hear
this
achievement
of
her
thus
speak
of
,
Bridget
sob
more
hysterically
than
ever
;
but
the
doctor
,
look
at
her
arm
as
she
hold
her
apron
to
her
face
,
think
in
his
heart
that
Joe
must
have
have
so
much
the
bad
of
it
,
that
there
could
be
no
possible
need
for
the
interference
of
Thomas
the
groom
.
  
<EOS>
and
such
turn
out
to
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
the
bridge
of
Joe
's
nose
be
break
;
and
the
doctor
have
to
set
it
for
him
in
a
little
bedroom
at
the
village
public
-
house
,
Bridget
have
positively
refuse
to
go
to
bed
in
the
same
house
with
so
dreadful
a
character
.
  
<EOS>
"
quiet
now
,
or
I
will
be
serve
thee
the
same
way
<EOS>
;
thee
see
I
have
find
the
trick
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
doctor
could
not
but
hear
so
much
as
he
make
his
way
into
his
own
house
by
the
back
door
,
after
finish
his
surgical
operation
.
<EOS>
Bridget
be
recount
to
her
champion
the
fracas
that
have
occur
;
and
he
,
as
be
so
natural
,
be
express
his
admiration
at
her
valour
.
   
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
go
out
to
dinner
 
<EOS>
the
next
day
Joe
do
not
make
his
appearance
,
and
Sir
Louis
,
with
many
execration
,
be
drive
to
the
terrible
necessity
of
dress
himself
.
<EOS>
then
come
an
unexpected
difficulty
:
how
be
they
to
get
up
to
the
house
?
<EOS>
walk
out
to
dinner
,
though
it
be
merely
through
the
village
and
up
the
avenue
,
seem
to
Sir
Louis
to
be
a
thing
impossible
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
be
not
well
able
to
walk
at
all
,
and
positively
declare
that
he
should
never
be
able
to
make
his
way
over
the
gravel
in
pump
.
<EOS>
His
mother
would
not
have
think
half
as
much
of
walk
from
Boxall
Hill
to
Greshamsbury
and
back
again
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
the
one
village
fly
be
send
for
,
and
the
matter
be
arrange
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
reach
the
house
,
it
be
easy
to
see
that
there
be
some
unwonted
bustle
.
<EOS>
in
the
drawing
-
room
there
be
no
one
but
Mr
Mortimer
Gazebee
,
who
introduce
himself
to
them
both
.
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
,
who
know
that
he
be
only
an
attorney
,
do
not
take
much
notice
of
him
,
but
the
doctor
enter
into
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
hear
that
Mr
Gresham
have
come
home
?
"
say
Mr
Gazebee
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Gresham
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
he
have
be
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Gresham
,
junior
,
I
mean
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
;
the
doctor
have
not
hear
.
<EOS>
Frank
have
return
unexpectedly
just
before
dinner
,
and
he
be
now
undergo
his
father
's
smile
,
his
mother
's
embrace
,
and
his
sister
"
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
quite
unexpectedly
,
"
say
Mr
Gazebee
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
have
bring
him
back
before
his
time
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
find
London
too
hot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
deuced
hot
,
"
say
the
baronet
.
<EOS>
"
I
find
it
so
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
keep
man
in
London
when
it
be
so
hot
;
except
those
fellow
who
have
business
to
do
:
they
be
pay
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Mortimer
Gazebee
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
manage
an
estate
which
owe
Sir
Louis
an
enormous
sum
of
money
,
and
,
therefore
,
he
could
not
afford
to
despise
the
baronet
;
but
he
think
to
himself
,
what
a
very
abject
fellow
the
man
would
be
if
he
be
not
a
baronet
,
and
have
not
a
large
fortune
!
  
<EOS>
and
then
the
squire
come
in
.
<EOS>
His
broad
,
honest
face
be
cover
with
a
smile
when
he
see
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thorne
,
"
he
say
,
almost
in
a
whisper
,
"
you
be
the
good
fellow
breathing
;
I
have
hardly
deserve
this
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
as
he
take
his
old
friend
's
hand
,
could
not
but
be
glad
that
he
have
follow
Mary
's
counsel
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
Frank
have
come
home
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
;
quite
unexpectedly
.
<EOS>
He
be
to
have
stay
a
week
longer
in
London
.
<EOS>
You
would
hardly
know
him
if
you
meet
him
.
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
,
I
beg
your
pardon
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
squire
go
up
to
his
other
guest
,
who
have
remain
somewhat
sullenly
stand
in
one
corner
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
man
of
high
rank
present
,
or
to
be
present
,
and
he
expect
to
be
treat
as
such
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
happy
to
have
the
pleasure
of
make
your
acquaintance
,
Mr
Gresham
,
"
say
the
baronet
,
intend
to
be
very
courteous
.
<EOS>
"
though
we
have
not
meet
before
,
I
very
often
see
your
name
in
my
account
 
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
<EOS>
and
Sir
Louis
laugh
as
though
he
have
say
something
very
good
.
  
<EOS>
the
meeting
between
Lady
Arabella
and
the
doctor
be
rather
distress
to
the
former
;
but
she
manage
to
get
over
it
.
<EOS>
She
shake
hand
with
him
graciously
,
and
say
that
it
be
a
fine
day
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
say
that
it
be
fine
,
only
perhaps
a
little
rainy
.
<EOS>
and
then
they
go
into
different
part
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
when
Frank
come
in
,
the
doctor
hardly
do
know
him
.
<EOS>
His
hair
be
dark
than
it
have
be
,
and
so
be
his
complexion
;
but
his
chief
disguise
be
in
a
long
silken
beard
,
which
hang
down
over
his
cravat
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
have
hitherto
not
be
much
in
favour
of
long
beard
,
but
he
could
not
deny
that
Frank
look
very
well
with
the
appendage
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
doctor
,
I
be
so
delighted
to
find
you
here
,
"
say
he
,
come
up
to
him
;
"
so
very
,
very
glad
:
"
and
,
take
the
doctor
's
arm
<EOS>
,
he
lead
him
away
into
a
window
,
where
they
be
alone
.
"
<EOS>
and
how
be
Mary
?
"
say
he
,
almost
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
I
wish
she
be
here
!
<EOS>
but
,
doctor
,
it
shall
all
come
in
time
.
<EOS>
but
tell
me
,
doctor
,
there
be
no
news
about
her
,
be
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
news
 
<EOS>
what
news
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
well
;
no
news
be
good
news
:
you
will
give
her
my
love
,
will
not
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
say
that
he
would
.
<EOS>
what
else
could
he
say
?
<EOS>
It
appear
quite
clear
to
him
that
some
of
Mary
's
fear
be
groundless
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
be
again
very
much
alter
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
say
,
that
though
he
be
a
boy
at
twenty
-
one
,
he
be
a
man
at
twenty
-
two
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
at
twenty
-
three
,
he
appear
to
be
almost
a
man
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
His
manner
be
easy
,
his
voice
under
his
control
,
and

He

<EOS>
They
be
all
delighted
to
praise
Frank

<EOS>
neither
do
it
come
amiss
to
Mr

the
doctor

who
have
both
a
personal
interest
in
the
young
hero

<EOS>
but
Sir
Louis
do
not

it
at
all
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
only
baronet

and
yet
nobody

<EOS>
He
be
seat

next

even
Lady

seem
to
think
more

<EOS>
see
how
he
be
ill

he
meditate
revenge

not

Lady

a
confession

<EOS>
"
ah
,
indeed
!

I

<EOS>
Sir

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
It
be
not

be
bear
that
Lady

should
turn
to
talk
to
a
dirty
attorney
,
and
leave
him
,
a
baronet
,
to
eat
his
dinner
without
notice

<EOS>
if
nothing
else
would
move
her

he
would
let

"
I

when
Mr

with
sorrow

that

be
small
,
he
have
at

pass
away
from

as
one
that
be
hardly
fit

even
between
him

<EOS>
so

two
eld
Miss
Greshams
.
<EOS>
and
Patience
Oriel
,
who
have
also
be
of
the
party
,
be
also
to
be
see
with
the
twin
.
<EOS>
Frank
look
at
his
father
with
almost
a
malicious
smile
,
and
begin
to
think
that
he
too
may
be
better
employ
out
among
the
walk
.
<EOS>
do
he
think
then
of
a
former
summer
evening
,
when
he
have
half
break
Mary
's
heart
by
walk
there
too
lovingly
with
Patience
Oriel
?
  
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
,
if
he
continue
his
brilliant
career
of
success
,
would
soon
be
leave
the
cock
of
the
walk
.
<EOS>
the
squire
,
to
be
sure
,
could
not
bolt
,
nor
could
the
doctor
very
well
;
but
they
may
be
equally
vanquish
,
remain
there
in
their
chair
.
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
,
during
all
this
time
,
be
sit
with
tingle
ear
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
may
be
say
that
his
whole
body
tingle
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
a
manner
responsible
for
this
horrid
scene
;
but
what
could
he
do
to
stop
it
?
<EOS>
He
could
not
take
Sir
Louis
up
bodily
and
carry
him
away
.
<EOS>
one
idea
do
occur
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
fly
have
be
order
for
ten
o'clock
.
<EOS>
He
could
rush
out
and
send
for
it
instantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
go
to
leave
me
?
"
say
the
squire
,
in
a
voice
of
horror
,
as
he
see
the
doctor
rise
from
his
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
no
,
no
,
"
say
the
doctor
;
and
then
he
whisper
the
purpose
of
his
mission
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
back
in
two
minute
.
<EOS>
"
the
doctor
would
have
give
twenty
pound
to
have
close
the
scene
at
once
;
but
he
be
not
the
man
to
desert
his
friend
in
such
a
strait
as
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
well
-
mean
fellow
,
the
doctor
,
"
say
Sir
Louis
,
when
his
guardian
be
out
of
the
room
,
"
very
;
but
he
be
not
up
to
trap
 
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
up
to
trap
 
well
,
I
should
say
he
be
;
that
is
,
if
I
know
what
trap
mean
,
"
say
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
but
that
be
just
the
ticket
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
?
<EOS>
now
I
say
Dr
Thorne
be
not
a
man
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
about
the
good
man
I
know
,
or
ever
hear
of
,
"
say
the
squire
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
if
any
man
ever
have
a
good
friend
,
you
have
get
one
in
him
;
and
so
have
I
:
"
<EOS>
and
the
squire
silently
drink
the
doctor
's
health
.
  
<EOS>
"
all
very
true
,
I
dare
say
;
but
yet
he
be
not
up
to
trap
.
<EOS>
now
look
here
,
squire
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
if
you
do
not
mind
,
sir
,
"
say
Frank
,
"
I
have
get
something
very
particular
 
perhaps
,
however
 
"
  
"
stay
till
Thorne
return
,
Frank
.
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
do
stay
till
Thorne
return
,
and
then
escape
.
  
<EOS>
"
excuse
me
,
doctor
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
something
very
particular
to
say
;
I
will
explain
to
-
morrow
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
the
three
be
leave
alone
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
be
now
become
almost
drunk
,
and
be
knock
his
word
together
.
<EOS>
the
squire
have
already
attempt
to
stop
the
bottle
;
but
the
baronet
have
contrive
to
get
hold
of
a
modicum
of
Madeira
,
and
there
be
no
prevent
him
from
help
himself
;
at
least
,
none
at
that
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
we
be
say
about
lawyer
,
"
continue
Sir
Louis
.
<EOS>
"
let
's
see
,
what
be
we

?
<EOS>
why
,
squire
,
it
be
just
here
.
<EOS>
those
fellow
will
fleece
us
both
if
we
do
not
mind
what
we
be
after
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
never
mind
about
lawyer
now
,
"
say
Dr
Thorne
,
angrily
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
but
I
do
mind
;
most
particularly
.
<EOS>
that
be
all
very
well
for
you
,
doctor
;
you
have
nothing
to
lose
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
great
stake
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
why
,
now
,
what
sum
of
money
of
mine
do
you
think
those

"
  
<EOS>
"
d

doctor

"
say
the
squire
in
a
tone
of
dismay
.
  
<EOS>
"
lawyer
,
I
mean
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
why
,
now
,
Gresham
;
we
be
all
tot
now
,
you
see
;
you
be
down
in
my
book
<EOS>
,
I
take
it
,
for
pretty
near
a
hundred
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
hold
your
tongue
,
sir
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
get
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
hold
my
tongue
!
"
say
Sir
Louis
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Louis
Scatcherd
,
"
say
the
squire
,
slowly
rise
from
his
chair
,
"
we
will
not
,
if
you
please
,
talk
about
business
at
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
perhaps
we
have
better
go
to
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
latter
proposition
have
certainly
not
come
from
the
squire
's
heart
:
go
to
the
lady
be
the
very
last
thing
for
which
Sir
Louis
be
now
fit
.
<EOS>
but
the
squire
have
say
it
as
be
the
only
recognise
formal
way
he
could
think
of
for
break
up
the
symposium
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
very
well
,
"
hiccup
the
baronet
,
"
I
be
always
ready
for
the
lady
,
"
and
he
stretch
out
his
hand
to
the
decanter
to
get
a
last
glass
of
Madeira
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
rise
stoutly
,
and
speak
with
a
determined
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
;
you
will
have
no
more
wine
:
"
and
he
take
the
decanter
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
all
this
about
?
"
say
Sir
Louis
,
with
a
drunken
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
he
can
not
go
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
Mr
Gresham
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
leave
him
here
with
me
,
I
will
stay
with
him
till
the
fly
come
.
<EOS>
pray
tell
Lady
Arabella
from
me
,
how
sorry
I
be
that
this
have
occur
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
squire
would
not
leave
his
friend
,
and
they
sit
together
till
the
fly
come
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
,
for
the
doctor
have
dispatch
his
messenger
with
much
haste
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
heartily
ashamed
of
myself
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
almost
with
tear
.
  
<EOS>
the
squire
take
him
by
the
hand
affectionately
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
a
tipsy
man
before
to
-
night
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
and
so
have
I
,
but
 
<EOS>
"
He
do
not
express
the
rest
of
his
thought
.
   
<EOS>
Will
He
come
again
?
 
<EOS>
long
before
the
doctor
return
home
after
the
little
dinner
-
party
above
describe
,
Mary
have
learn
that
Frank
be
already
at
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
She
have
hear
nothing
of
him
or
from
him
,
not
a
word
,
nothing
in
the
shape
of
a
message
,
for
twelve
month
;
and
at
her
age
twelve
month
be
a
long
period
.
<EOS>
Would
he
come
and
see
her
in
spite
of
his
mother
?
<EOS>
Would
he
send
her
any
tiding
of
his
return
,
or
notice
her
in
any
way
?
<EOS>
if
he
do
not
,
what
would
she
do
?
<EOS>
and
if
he
do
,
what
then
would
she
do
?
<EOS>
It
be
so
hard
to
resolve
;
so
hard
to
be
desert
;
and
so
hard
to
dare
to
wish
that
she
may
not
be
desert
!
<EOS>
She
continue
to
say
to
herself
,
that
it
would
be
well
that
they
should
be
stranger
;
and
she
could
hardly
keep
herself
from
tear
in
the
fear
that
they
may
be
so
.
<EOS>
what
chance
could
there
be
that
he
should
care
for
her
,
after
an
absence
spend
in
travel
over
the
world
?
<EOS>
no
;
she
would
forget
that
affair
of
his
hand
;
and
then
,
immediately
after
have
so
determined
,
she
would
confess
to
herself
that
it
be
a
thing
not
to
be
forget
,
and
impossible
of
oblivion
.
  
<EOS>
on
her
uncle
's
return
,
she
would
hear
some
word
about
him
;
and
so
she
sit
alone
,
with
a
book
before
her
,
of
which
she
could
not
read
a
line
.
<EOS>
She
expect
them
about
eleven
,
and
be
,
therefore
,
rather
surprised
when
the
fly
stop
at
the
door
before
nine
.
  
<EOS>
She
immediately
hear
her
uncle
's
voice
,
loud
and
angry
,
call
for
Thomas
.
<EOS>
both
Thomas
and
Bridget
be
unfortunately
out
,
be
,
at
this
moment
,
forgetful
of
all
sublunary
care
,
and
seat
in
happiness
under
a
beech
-
tree
in
the
park
.
<EOS>
Janet
fly
to
the
little
gate
,
and
there
find
Sir
Louis
insist
that
he
would
be
take
at
once
to
his
own
mansion
at
Boxall
Hill
,
and
positively
swear
that
he
would
no
longer
submit
to
the
insult
of
the
doctor
's
surveillance
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
absence
of
Thomas
,
the
doctor
be
force
to
apply
for
assistance
to
the
driver
of
the
fly
.
<EOS>
between
them
the
baronet
be
drag
out
of
the
vehicle
,
the
window
suffer
much
,
and
the
doctor
's
hat
also
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
,
he
be
take
upstairs
,
and
be
at
last
put
to
bed
,
Janet
assist
;
nor
do
the
doctor
leave
the
room
till
his
guest
be
asleep
.
<EOS>
then
he
go
into
the
drawing
-
room
to
Mary
.
<EOS>
It
may
easily
be
conceive
that
he
be
hardly
in
a
humour
to
talk
much
about
Frank
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
I
to
do
with
him
?
"
say
he
,
almost
in
tear
:
"
what
be
I
to
do
with
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
not
send
him
to
Boxall
Hill
?
"
ask
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
to
kill
himself
there
!
<EOS>
but
it
be
no
matter
;
he
will
kill
himself
somewhere
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
what
that
family
have
do
for
me
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
suddenly
remember
a
portion
of
their
doing
,
he
take
Mary
in
his
arm
,
and
kiss
and
bless
her
;
and
declare
that
,
in
spite
of
all
this
,
he
be
a
happy
man
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
word
about
Frank
that
night
.
<EOS>
the
next
morning
the
doctor
find
Sir
Louis
very
weak
,
and
beg
for
stimulant
.
<EOS>
He
be
bad
than
weak
;
he
be
in
such
a
state
of
wretched
misery
and
mental
prostration
;
so
low
in
heart
,
in
such
collapse
of
energy
and
spirit
,
that
Dr
Thorne
think
it
prudent
to
remove
his
razor
from
his
reach
.
  
<EOS>
"
for
God
's
sake
do
let
me
have
a
little
_
chasse
-
café
_
;
I
be
always
use
to
it
;
ask
Joe
if
I
be
not
!
<EOS>
You
do
not
want
to
kill
me
,
do
you
?
"
<EOS>
and
the
baronet
cry
piteously
,
like
a
child
,
and
,
when
the
doctor
leave
him
for
the
breakfast
-
table
,
abjectly
implore
Janet
to
get
him
some
curaçoa
which
he
know
be
in
one
of
his
portmanteaus
.
<EOS>
Janet
,
however
,
be
true
to
her
master
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
do
give
him
some
wine
;
and
then
,
have
leave
strict
order
as
to
his
treatment
 
<EOS>
Bridget
and
Thomas
be
now
both
in
the
house
 
go
forth
to
some
of
his
too
much
neglect
patient
.
  
<EOS>
then
Mary
be
again
alone
,
and
her
mind
fly
away
to
her
lover
.
<EOS>
how
should
she
be
able
to
compose
herself
when
she
should
first
see
him
?
<EOS>
see
him
she
must
.
<EOS>
People
can
not
live
in
the
same
village
without
meet
.
<EOS>
if
she
pass
him
at
the
church
-
door
,
as
she
often
pass
Lady
Arabella
,
what
should
she
do
?
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
always
smile
a
peculiar
,
little
,
bitter
smile
,
and
this
,
with
half
a
nod
of
recognition
,
carry
off
the
meeting
.
<EOS>
Should
she
try
the
bitter
smile
,
the
half
-
nod
with
Frank
?
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
she
know
it
be
not
in
her
to
be
so
much
mistress
of
her
own
heart
's
blood
.
  
<EOS>
as
she
thus
think
,
she
stand
at
the
drawing
-
room
window
,
look
out
into
her
garden
;
and
,
as
she
lean
against
the
sill
,
her
head
be
surround
by
the
sweet
creeper
.
<EOS>
"
at
any
rate
,
he
will
not
come
here
,
"
she
say
:
<EOS>
and
so
,
with
a
deep
sigh
,
she
turn
from
the
window
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
there
he
be
,
<EOS>
Frank
Gresham
himself
stand
there
in
her
immediate
presence
,
beautiful
as
Apollo
.
<EOS>
Her
next
thought
be
how
she
may
escape
from
out
of
his
arm
.
<EOS>
how
it
happen
that
she
have
fall
into
them
,
she
never
know
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
!
<EOS>
my
own
,
own
love
!
<EOS>
my
own
one

<EOS>
sweetest

<EOS>
Mary

<EOS>
dear
Mary

<EOS>
have
you
not
a

me

"
  
<EOS>
no
;
she
have
not
a
word
,
though
her
life
have
depend
on
it
.
<EOS>
the
exertion
necessary
for
not
cry
be
quite
enough
for
her
.
<EOS>
this
,
then
,
be
the
bitter
smile
and
the
half
-
nod
that
be
to
pass
between
them
;
this
be
the
manner
in
which
estrangement
be
to
grow
into
indifference
;
this
be
the
mode
of
meeting
by
which
she
be
to
prove
that
she
be
mistress
of
her
conduct
,
if
not
her
heart
!
<EOS>
there
he
hold
her
close
bind
to
his
breast
,
and
she
could
only
protect
her
face
,
and
that
all
ineffectually
,
with
her
hand
.
"
<EOS>
He
love
another
,
"
Beatrice
have
say
.
<EOS>
"
at
any
rate
,
he
will
not
love
me
,
"
her
own
heart
have
say
also

<EOS>
here
be
now
the
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
you
can
not
marry
him
,
"
Beatrice
have
say
,
also
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
if
that
really
be
so
,
be
not
this
embrace
deplorable
for
them
both
?
<EOS>
and
yet
how
could
she
not
be
happy
?
<EOS>
She
endeavour
to
repel
him
;
but
with
what
a
weak
endeavour
!
<EOS>
Her
pride
have
be
wound
to
the
core
,
not
by
Lady
Arabella
's
scorn
,
but
by
the
conviction
which
have
grow
on
her
,
that
though
she
have
give
her
own
heart
absolutely
away
,
have
part
with
it
wholly
and
for
ever
,
she
have
receive
nothing
in
return
.
<EOS>
the
world
,
her
world
,
would
know
that
she
have
love
,
and
love
in
vain
.
<EOS>
but
here
now
be
the
love
one
at
her
foot
;
the
first
moment
that
his
enforced
banishment
be
over
,
have
bring
him
there
.
<EOS>
how
could
she
not
be
happy
?
  
<EOS>
They
all
say
that
she
could
not
marry
him
.
<EOS>
well
,
perhaps
it
may
be
so
;
nay
,
when
she
think
of
it
,
must
not
that
edict
too
probably
be
true
?
<EOS>
but
if
so
,
it
would
not
be
his
fault
.
<EOS>
He
be
true
to
her
,
and
that
satisfy
her
pride
.
<EOS>
He
have
take
from
her
,
by
surprise
,
a
confession
of
her
love
.
<EOS>
She
have
often
regret
her
weakness
in
allow
him
to
do
so
;
but
she
could
not
regret
it
now
.
<EOS>
She
could
endure
to
suffer
;
nay
,
it
would
not
be
suffer
while
he
suffer
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
one
word

Mary
?
<EOS>
then
after
all
my
dream
,
after
all
my
patience
,
you
do
not
love
me
at
last

"
  
<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
notwithstanding
what

thou

be
any
word
necessary
for
thee

<EOS>
have
not
her
heart
beat
against
thine

<EOS>
have
she
not
borne
thy
caress

<EOS>
have
there
be
one
touch
of
anger
when
she
ward
off
thy

Bridget

in
the

when

amorous

smash
his

when

Miss

<EOS>
at
last
Mary
succeed
in
her
effort
at
enfranchisement
,
and
she
and
Frank
stand
at
some
little
distance
from
each
other

<EOS>
She
could
not

marvel
at
him

<EOS>
that
long
,
soft
beard
,
which
just
now
have
be
so
close
to
her
face

all
new

his
whole
look
be
alter
;
his
mien
,
and
gait
,
and
very
voice
be
not
the

<EOS>
be
this
,
indeed
,
the
very
Frank
who
have
chatter
of
his
boyish
love
,
two
year
since

in
the
garden
at
Greshamsbury

Mr

tell
me

I

"
Frank

she
say
,
and
then
stop
;
not
be
able
at
the
moment
to
get
any
further
.
  
<EOS>
"
speak
to
me
honestly
,
Mary

honestly
and
bravely
.
<EOS>
I
offer
you
my
hand
once
before

there
it
be
again
.
<EOS>
Will
you
take
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
look
wistfully
up
in
his
eye
;
she
would
fain
have
take
it
.
<EOS>
but
though
a
girl
may
be
honest
in
such
a
case
,
it
be
so
hard
for
her
to
be
brave

<EOS>
He
still
hold
out
his
hand

<EOS>
"
Mary

"

he
,
"
if
you

it

we
will
get
over

I
be
a
free

free

so

<EOS>
there
be
my

<EOS>
Will
you
have
it

"
<EOS>
and
then
he
,
too
,
look
into
her
eye
,
and
wait
composedly
,
as
though
determine
to
have
an
answer
.
  
<EOS>
She
slowly
raise
her
hand
,
and
,
as
she
do
so
,
her
eye
fall
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
It
then
droop
again
,
and
be
again
raise
;
and
,
at
last
,
her
light
taper
finger
rest
on
his
broad
open
palm

<EOS>
They
be
soon
clutch
,
and
the
whole
hand
bring
absolutely
within

<EOS>
"
there
,
now

say
,
"

"
oh

be
not

"
<EOS>
imprudent

<EOS>
I
be
sick

I
hate
prudence

as
for

<EOS>
no

I
say

certainly

Mary
 
eh

<EOS>
You
do
!
<EOS>
do
not
you

<EOS>
He
would
not
excuse
her
,
or
allow
her
to
escape
from
say
it
in
so
many
word
;
and
when
the
word
do
come
at
last
,
they
come
freely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
Frank
,
I
do
love
you

if
that
be
all
you
would

I
will
have
no

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah

but
your
father

Frank

my
uncle

<EOS>
I
can
never
bring
myself
to
do
anything
that
shall
bring
either
of
them
to
sorrow

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
,
of
course
,
run
through
all
his
argument
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
into
a
profession
,
or
take
a
farm
and
live
in
it
.
<EOS>
He
would
wait
;
that
is
,
for
a
few
month
.
<EOS>
"
a
few
month
,
Frank
!
"
say
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
perhaps
six
.
"
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Frank
!
"
but
Frank
would
not
be
stop
.
<EOS>
He
would
do
anything
that
his
father
may
ask
him
.
<EOS>
anything
but
the
one
thing
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
give
up
the
wife
he
have
choose
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
reasonable
,
or
proper
,
or
righteous
that
he
should
be
ask
to
do
so
;
and
here
he
mount
a
somewhat
high
horse
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
have
no
argument
which
she
could
bring
from
her
heart
to
offer
in
opposition
to
all
this
.
<EOS>
She
could
only
leave
her
hand
in
his
,
and
feel
that
she
be
happy
than
she
have
be
at
any
time
since
the
day
of
that
donkey
-
ride
at
Boxall
Hill
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Mary
,
"
continue
he
,
become
very
grave
and
serious
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
be
true
to
each
other
,
and
firm
in
this
.
<EOS>
nothing
that
any
of
them
can
say
shall
drive
me
from
my
purpose
;
will
you
say
as
much
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
hand
be
still
in
his
,
and
so
she
stand
,
think
for
a
moment
before
she
answer
him
.
<EOS>
but
she
could
not
do
less
for
him
than
he
be
willing
to
do
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
"
say
she
 
say
in
a
very
low
voice
,
and
with
a
manner
perfectly
quiet
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
firm
.
<EOS>
nothing
that
they
can
say
shall
shake
me
.
<EOS>
but
,
Frank
,
it
can
not
be
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
nothing
further
occur
in
this
interview
which
need
recording
.
<EOS>
Frank
have
be
three
time
tell
by
Mary
that
he
have
better
go
before
he
do
go
;
and
,
at
last
,
she
be
oblige
to
take
the
matter
into
her
own
hand
,
and
lead
him
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
rid
of
me
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
be
here
two
hour
,
and
you
must
go
now
;
what
will
they
all
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
care
what
they
think
?
<EOS>
let
them
think
the
truth
:
that
after
a
year
's
absence
,
I
have
much
to
say
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
however
,
at
last
,
he
do
go
,
and
Mary
be
leave
alone
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
,
although
he
have
be
so
slow
to
move
,
have
a
thousand
other
thing
to
do
,
and
go
about
them
at
once
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
much
in
love
,
no
doubt
;
but
that
do
not
interfere
with
his
interest
in
other
pursuit
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
he
have
to
see
Harry
Baker
,
and
Harry
Baker
's
stud
.
<EOS>
Harry
have
be
specially
charge
to
look
after
the
black
horse
during
Frank
's
absence
,
and
the
holiday
doing
of
that
valuable
animal
have
to
be
inquire
into
.
<EOS>
then
the
kennel
of
the
hound
have
to
be
visit
,
and
 
as
a
matter
of
second
-
rate
importance
 
the
master
.
<EOS>
this
could
not
be
do
on
the
same
day
;
but
a
plan
for
do
so
must
be
concoct
with
Harry
 
<EOS>
and
then
there
be
two
young
pointer
pup
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
,
when
he
leave
his
betroth
,
go
about
these
thing
quite
as
vehemently
as
though
he
be
not
in
love
at
all
;
quite
as
vehemently
as
though
he
have
say
nothing
as
to
go
into
some
profession
which
must
necessarily
separate
him
from
horse
and
dog
.
<EOS>
but
Mary
sit
there
at
her
window
,
think
of
her
love
,
and
thinking
of
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
in
all
to
her
now
.
<EOS>
She
have
pledge
herself
not
to
be
shake
from
her
troth
by
anything
,
by
any
person
;
and
it
would
behove
her
to
be
true
to
this
pledge
.
<EOS>
true
to
it
,
though
all
the
Greshams
but
one
should
oppose
her
with
all
their
power
;
true
to
it
,
even
though
her
own
uncle
should
oppose
her
.
  
<EOS>
and
how
could
she
have
do
any
other
than
so
pledge
herself
,
invoke
to
it
as
she
have
be
?
<EOS>
how
could
she
do
less
for
him
than
he
be
so
anxious
to
do
for
her
?
<EOS>
They
would
talk
to
her
of
maiden
delicacy
,
and
tell
her
that
she
have
put
a
stain
on
that
snow
-
white
coat
of
proof
,
in
confess
her
love
for
one
whose
friend
be
unwilling
to
receive
her
.
<EOS>
let
them
so
talk
.
<EOS>
honour
,
honesty
,
and
truth
,
out
-
speak
truth
,
self
-
deny
truth
,
and
fealty
from
man
to
man
,
be
worth
more
than
maiden
delicacy
;
more
,
at
any
rate
,
than
the
talk
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
for
herself
that
this
pledge
have
be
make
.
<EOS>
She
know
her
position
,
and
the
difficulty
of
it
;
she
know
also
the
value
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
much
to
offer
,
much
to
give
;
she
have
nothing
but
herself
.
<EOS>
He
have
name
,
and
old
repute
,
family
,
honour
,
and
what
eventually
would
at
least
be
wealth
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
nameless
,
fameless
,
portionless
.
<EOS>
He
have
come
there
with
all
his
ardour
,
with
the
impulse
of
his
character
,
and
ask
for
her
love
.
<EOS>
It
be
already
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
have
then
demand
her
troth
,
and
she
acknowledge
that
he
have
a
right
to
demand
it
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
his
if
ever
it
should
be
in
his
power
to
take
her
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
let
the
bargain
end
.
<EOS>
She
would
always
remember
,
that
though
it
be
in
her
power
to
keep
her
pledge
,
it
may
too
probably
not
be
in
his
power
to
keep
his
.
<EOS>
that
doctrine
,
lay
down
so
imperatively
by
the
great
authority
of
Greshamsbury
,
that
edict
,
which
demand
that
Frank
should
marry
money
,
have
come
home
also
to
her
with
a
certain
force
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
sad
that
the
fame
of
Greshamsbury
should
perish
,
and
that
the
glory
should
depart
from
the
old
house
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
,
that
Frank
also
should
perceive
that
he
must
marry
money
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
pity
that
he
have
not
see
it
sooner
;
but
she
,
at
any
rate
,
would
not
complain
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
she
stand
,
lean
on
the
open
window
,
with
her
book
unnoticed
lie
beside
her
.
<EOS>
the
sun
have
be
in
the
mid
-
sky
when
Frank
have
leave
her
,
but
its
ray
be
begin
to
stream
into
the
room
from
the
west
before
she
move
from
her
position
.
<EOS>
Her
first
thought
in
the
morning
have
be
this
:
Would
he
come
to
see
her
?
<EOS>
Her
last
now
be
more
soothing
to
her
,
less
full
of
absolute
fear
:
Would
it
be
right
that
he
should
come
again
?
  
<EOS>
the
first
sound
she
hear
be
the
footstep
of
her
uncle
,
as
he
come
up
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
three
step
at
a
time
.
<EOS>
His
step
be
always
heavy
;
but
when
he
be
disturb
in
spirit
,
it
be
slow
;
when
merely
fatigue
in
body
by
ordinary
work
,
it
be
quick
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
broil
day
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
and
he
throw
himself
into
a
chair
.
<EOS>
"
for
mercy
's
sake
give
me
something
to
drink
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
now
the
doctor
be
a
great
man
for
summer
-
drink
.
<EOS>
in
his
house
,
lemonade
,
currant
-
juice
,
orange
-
mixture
,
and
raspberry
-
vinegar
be
use
by
the
quart
.
<EOS>
He
frequently
disapprove
of
these
thing
for
his
patient
,
as
be
apt
to
disarrange
the
digestion
;
but
he
consume
enough
himself
to
throw
a
large
family

the

swallow
his

put
down
the

any

<EOS>
Dr

have
nothing
more

he
get
up

it

the

at

I

the

She

no

what
the

have
order

<EOS>
the
doctor
would
then

no

give
him
anything
that
be
proper
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
swear
a
good
deal

storm
as

he
could

<EOS>
He
drink
,
however
,
his
two
glass

and
he
get
no
more
.
<EOS>
once
or
twice
he
essay
to
get
out
of
bed

dress
;
but
,
at
every
effort
,
he
find
that
he
could
not
do
it
without
Joe
:
<EOS>
and
there
he
be
,
still
under
the
clothe
when
the
doctor
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
it
be

"
say
he
,
as
soon
as
his
guardian
enter
the
room

"
I
be
not
go

make
a
prisoner

"
  
<EOS>
"
a

<EOS>
no

It

Your

I
do

I

it

<EOS>
You
be
not
go
to
make
a
child
of
me
,
Dr
thorne

so
you
need
not
think
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
there
be
a
long
quarrel
between
them
,
and
<EOS>
but
an
indifferent
reconciliation
.
<EOS>
the
baronet
say
that
he
would
go
to
Boxall
Hill
,
and
be
vehement
in
his
intention
to
do
so
because
the
doctor
oppose
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
,
however
,
as
yet
ferret
out
the
squire
,
or
give
a
bit
of
his
mind
to
Mr
Gazebee
,
and
it
behove
him
to
do
this
before
he
take
himself
off
to
his
own
country
mansion
.
<EOS>
He
end
,
therefore
,
by
decide
to
go
on
the
next
day
but
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
it
be
so
,
if
you
be
well
enough
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
enough
!
"
say
the
other
,
with
a
sneer
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
to
make
me
ill
that
I
know
of
.
<EOS>
It
certainly
will
not
be
drink
too
much
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
on
the
next
day
,
Sir
Louis
be
in
a
different
mood
,
and
in
one
more
distressing
for
the
doctor
to
bear
.
<EOS>
His
compel
abstinence
from
intemperate
drinking
have
,
no
doubt
,
be
good
for
him
;
but
his
mind
have
so
much
sink
under
the
pain
of
the
privation
,
that
his
state
be
piteous
to
behold
.
<EOS>
He
have
cry
for
his
servant
,
as
a
child
cry
for
its
nurse
,
till
at
last
the
doctor
,
move
to
pity
,
have
himself
go
out
and
bring
the
man
in
from
the
public
-
house
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
do
come
,
Joe
be
of
but
little
service
to
his
master
,
as
he
be
altogether
prevent
from
bring
him
either
wine
or
spirit
;
and
when
he
search
for
the
liqueur
-
case
,
he
find
that
even
that
have
be
carry
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
want
me
to
die
,
"
he
say
,
as
the
doctor
,
sit
by
his
bedside
,
be
try
,
for
the
hundredth
time
,
to
make
him
understand
that
he
have
<EOS>
but
one
chance
of
living
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
be
not
the
least
irritated
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
as
wise
to
be
irritate
by
the
want
of
reason
in
a
dog
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
do
what
I
can
to
save
your
life
,
"
he
say
calmly
;
"
but
,
as
you
say
just
now
,
I
have
no
power
over
you
.
<EOS>
as
long
as
you
be
able
to
move
and
remain
in
my
house
,
you
certainly
shall
not
have
the
mean
of
destroy
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
very
wise
to
stay
here
for
a
week
or
ten
day
:
a
week
or
ten
day
of
healthy
living
might
,
perhaps
,
bring
you
round
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
again
declare
that
the
doctor
wish
him
to
die
,
and
speak
of
send
for
his
attorney
,
Finnie
,
to
come
to
Greshamsbury
to
look
after
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
send
for
him
if
you
choose
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
His
coming
will
cost
you
three
or
four
pound
,
but
can
do
no
other
harm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
will
send
for
Fillgrave
,
"
threaten
the
baronet
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
go
to
die
here
like
a
dog
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
hard
upon
Dr
Thorne
that
he
should
be
oblige
to
entertain
such
a
guest
in
the
house
;
 
to
entertain
him
,
and
foster
him
,
and
care
for
him
,
almost
as
though
he
be
a
son
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
no
alternative
;
he
have
accept
the
charge
from
Sir
Roger
,
and
he
must
go
through
with
it
.
<EOS>
His
conscience
,
moreover
,
allow
him
no
rest
in
this
matter
:
it
harass
him
day
and
night
,
drive
him
on
sometimes
to
great
wretchedness
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
love
this
incubus
that
be
on
his
shoulder
;
he
could
not
do
other
than
be
very
far
from
love
him
.
<EOS>
of
what
use
or
value
be
he
to
any
one
?
<EOS>
what
could
the
world
make
of
him
that
would
be
good
,
or
he
of
the
world
?
<EOS>
be
not
an
early
death
<EOS>
his
certain
fate
?
<EOS>
the
earlier
it
may
be
,
would
it
not
be
the
well
?
  
<EOS>
be
he
to
linger
on
yet
for
two
year
longer
 
and
such
a
space
of
life
be
possible
for
him
 
how
great
would
be
the
mischief
that
he
may
do
;
nay
,
certainly
would
do
!
<EOS>
farewell
then
to
all
hope
for
Greshamsbury
,
as
far
as
Mary
be
concern
.
<EOS>
Farewell
then
to
that
dear
scheme
which
lie
deep
in
the
doctor
's
heart
,
that
hope
that
he
may
,
in
his
niece
's
name
,
give
back
to
the
son
the
lost
property
of
the
father
.
<EOS>
and
may
not
one
year
 
six
month
be
as
fatal
.
<EOS>
Frank
,
they
all
say
,
must
marry
money
;
and
even
he
 
<EOS>
he
the
doctor
himself
,
much
as
he
despise
the
idea
for
money
's
sake
 
<EOS>
even
he
could
not
but
confess
that
Frank
,
as
the
heir
to
an
old
,
but
grievously
embarrassed
property
,
have
no
right
to
marry
,
at
his
early
age
,
a
girl
without
a
shilling
.
<EOS>
Mary
,
his
niece
,
his
own
child
,
would
probably
be
the
heiress
of
this
immense
wealth
;
but
he
could
not
tell
this
to
Frank
;
no
,
nor
to
Frank
's
father
while
Sir
Louis
be
yet
alive
.
<EOS>
what
,
if
by
so
do
he
should
achieve
this
marriage
for
his
niece
,
and
that
then
Sir
Louis
should
live
to
dispose
of
his
own
?
<EOS>
how
then
would
he
face
the
anger
of
Lady
Arabella
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
hanker
after
a
dead
man
's
shoe
,
neither
for
myself
nor
for
another
,
"
he
have
say
to
himself
a
hundred
time
;
and
as
often
do
he
accuse
himself
of
do
so
.
<EOS>
one
path
,
however
,
be
plainly
open
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
keep
his
peace
as
to
the
will
;
and
would
use
such
effort
as
he
may
use
for
a
son
of
his
own
loin
to
preserve
the
life
that
be
so
valueless
.
<EOS>
His
wish
,
his
hope
,
his
thought
,
he
could
not
control
;
but
his
conduct
be
at
his
own
disposal
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
doctor
,
you
do
not
really
think
that
I

Sir
Louis
say
,
when
Dr
Thorne
again
visit
him

I
do
not

at
all

you
will
kill
yourself
if
you

have
lately
do

<EOS>

suppose
I

begin
to
weep

<EOS>
the
doctor
go
away
to
his
dinner
,
and
the
baronet
also
have
his
in
bed
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
eat
much
,
but
he
be
allow
two
glass
of
wine

and
also
a
little
brandy
in
his
coffee

this
somewhat
invigorate
him

again
go
to
him

in
the
evening

he
do
not
find
him
so
utterly
prostrate
in
spirit

<EOS>
He
have

indeed

make
up
his
mind
to
a
great
resolve

thus
unfold
his
final
scheme
for
his

reformation

the
doctor
assure
him

truth
the
case

well

I
will
tell
you

about

great
deal

day

indeed

I
have
,
and
I
want
to
do
what

right

<EOS>
Might
not
I
have
a
little
drop
more
of
that
stuff

just
in
a
cup
of
coffee

<EOS>
the
doctor
pour
him
out
a
cup
of
coffee
,
and
put
about
a
teaspoonful
of
brandy
in
it

<EOS>
Sir
Louis
take
it
with
a
disconsolate
face

not
have
be
accustom
to
such
measure
in
the
use

his
favourite
beverage

<EOS>
"
I
do
wish
to
do
what
be
right

I
do

indeed

only
,
you
see

I
be
so
lonely

as
to
those

up

London

I

<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
be
of
the

way
of
thinking
,

he
say
so
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
but
feel
some
sympathy
with
the
unfortunate
man
as
he
thus
speak
of
his
own
lot
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
he
have
be
throw
on
the
world
without

care
of
him

<EOS>
"
My

I

You

You

wretched

Sir

still

there
be
leave

him
the
power

feel
something

sincere
love

<EOS>
It
may
be
presume
that

that

be
at

he
would

It

he
ask

alas

that

could
not

this

<EOS>
Sir

say
he
,
"
I
can
forgive
you

I
can
also
forgive
something
on

you
ought
to
know

,
you
ought
by
this
time
to
have
learn
,
that
there
be
some
thing
which
a
man
can
not
forgive
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
talk
to
you
about
my
niece

remember
this
,
also
,
I
will
not
have
her
trouble
by
you

"
and
,
so
say
,
the
doctor
leave
him
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
next
day
the
baronet
be
sufficiently
recover
to
be
able
to
resume
his
braggadocio
air
.
<EOS>
He
swear
at
Janet
;
insist
on
be
serve
by
his
own
man
;
demand
in
a
loud
voice
,
but
in
vain
,
that
his
liqueur
-
case
should
be
restore
to
him
;
and
desire
that
post
-
horse
may
be
ready
for
him
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
on
that
day
he
get
up
and
eat
his
dinner
in
his
bedroom
.
<EOS>
on
the
next
morning
he
countermand
the
horse
,
inform
the
doctor
that
he
do
so
because
he
have
a
little
bit
of
business
to
transact
with
Squire
Gresham
before
he
leave
the
place
!
<EOS>
with
some
difficulty
,
the
doctor
make
him
understand
that
the
squire
would
not
see
him
on
business
;
and
it
be
at
last
decide
,
that
Mr
Gazebee
should
be
invite
to
call
on
him
at
the
doctor
's
house
;
and
this
Mr
Gazebee
agree
to
do
,
in
order
to
prevent
the
annoyance
of
have
the
baronet
up
at
Greshamsbury
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
day
,
the
evening
before
Mr
Gazebee
's
visit
,
Sir
Louis
condescend
to
come
down
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
He
dine
,
however
,
_
tête
-
à
-
tête
_
with
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
Mary
be
not
there
,
nor
be
anything
say
as
to
her
absence
.
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
Scatcherd
never
set
eye
upon
her
again
.
  
<EOS>
He
bear
himself
very
arrogantly
on
that
evening
,
have
resume
the
air
and
would
-
be
dignity
which
he
think
belong
to
him
as
a
man
of
rank
and
property
.
<EOS>
in
his
period
of
low
spirit
,
he
be
abject
and
humble
enough
;
abject
,
and
fearful
of
the
lamentable
destiny
which
at
these
moment
he
believe
to
be
in
store
for
him
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
one
of
the
peculiar
symptom
of
his
state
,
that
as
he
partially
recover
his
bodily
health
,
the
tone
of
his
mind
recover
itself
also
,
and
his
fear
for
the
time
be
relieve
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
very
little
say
between
him
and
the
doctor
that
evening
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
sit
guard
the
wine
,
and
think
when
he
should
have
his
house
to
himself
again
.
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
sit
moody
,
every
now
and
then
utter
some
impertinence
as
to
the
Greshams
and
the
Greshamsbury
property
,
and
,
at
an
early
hour
,
allow
Joe
to
put
him
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
the
horse
be
order
on
the
next
day
for
three
,
and
,
at
two
,
Mr
Gazebee
come
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
be
there
before
,
nor
have
he
ever
meet
Dr
Thorne
except
at
the
squire
's
dinner
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
he
ask
only
for
the
baronet
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
ah
!
<EOS>
I
be
glad
you
be
come
,
Mr
Gazebee
;
very
glad
,
"
say
Sir
Louis
;
act
the
part
of
the
rich
,
great
man
with
all
the
power
he
have
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
ask
you
a
few
question
so
as
to
make
it
all
clear
sailing
between
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
you
have
ask
to
see
me
,
I
have
come
,
Sir
Louis
,
"
say
the
other
,
put
on
much
dignity
as
he
speak
.
<EOS>
"
but
would
it
not
be
well
that
any
business
there
may
be
should
be
do
among
the
lawyer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
lawyer
be
very
well
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
;
but
<EOS>
when
a
man
have
so
large
a
stake
at
interest
as
I
have
in
this
Greshamsbury
property
,
why
,
you
see
,
Mr
Gazebee
,
he
feel
a
little
inclined
to
look
after
it
himself
.
<EOS>
now
,
do
you
know
,
Mr
Gazebee
,
how
much
it
be
that
Mr
Gresham
owe
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Gazebee
,
of
course
,
do
know
very
well
;
but
he
be
not
go
to
discuss
the
subject
with
Sir
Louis
,
if
he
could
help
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
whatever
claim
your
father
's
estate
may
have
on
that
of
Mr
Gresham
be
,
as
far
as
I
understand
,
vest
in
Dr
Thorne
's
hand
as
trustee
.
<EOS>
I
be
incline
to
believe
that
you
have
not
yourself
at
present
any
claim
on
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
the
interest
,
as
it
become
due
,
be
pay
to
Dr
Thorne
;
and
if
I
may
be
allow
to
make
a
suggestion
,
I
would
say
that
it
will
not
be
expedient
to
make
any
change
in
that
arrangement
till
the
property
shall
come
into
your
own
hand

I
differ
from
you
entirely

in

we
use
to
say
at
Eton

what
you
mean

say

I
can
not
go
to
law
with
Mr
Gresham

;
I
be
not
so
sure
of
that
;

perhaps
not
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
compel
Dr
Thorne
to
look
after
my
interest
.
<EOS>
I
can
force
him
to
foreclose
.
<EOS>
and
to
tell
you
the
truth

Gazebee

some
arrangement
be
propose
to
me

I
shall

advantageous

I
shall
do
so

I
have

easy

secure

the

I
do
not

such
a
sum

that

besides

I

I

<EOS>
Mr

use
all
the
perspicuity

his

well

Mr

declare

take
his

on
that
afternoon

Sir

go
off
to
Boxall
Hill

transfer
the
miserable
task

He
again
wrap
himself
in

climb
up

Greshamsbury
House

June

.
  
<EOS>
my
dearest
amelia
,
  
I
wish
to
consult
you
on
a
subject
which
,
as
you
will
perceive
,
be
of
a
most
momentous
nature
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
much
reliance
I
place
in
your
judgement
and
knowledge
of
what
be
proper
,
and
,
therefore
,
I
write
to
you
before
speak
to
any
other
live
person
on
the
subject
:
not
even
to
mamma
;
<EOS>
for
,
although
her
judgement
be
good
too
,
she
have
so
many
care
and
trouble
,
that
it
be
natural
that
it
should
be
a
little
warped
when
the
interest
of
her
child
be
concerned
.
<EOS>
now
that
it
be
all
over
,
I
feel
that
it
may
possibly
have
be
so
in
the
case
of
Mr
Moffat
.
  
<EOS>
You
be
aware
that
Mr
Mortimer
Gazebee
be
now
stay
here
,
and
that
he
have
be
here
for
nearly
two
month
.
<EOS>
He
be
engage
in
manage
poor
papa
's
affair
,
and
mamma
,
who
like
him
very
much
,
say
that
he
be
a
most
excellent
man
of
business
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
you
know
that
he
be
the
junior
partner
in
the
very
old
firm
of
Gumption
,
Gazebee
,
&
Gazebee
,
who
,
I
understand
,
do
not
undertake
any
business
at
all
,
except
what
come
to
them
from
peer
,
or
commoner
of
the
very
high
class
.
  
<EOS>
I
soon
perceive
,
dear
Amelia
,
that
Mr
Gazebee
pay
me
more
than
ordinary
attention
,
and
I
immediately
become
very
guarded
in
my
manner
.
<EOS>
I
certainly
like
Mr
Gazebee
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
His
manner
be
quite
excellent
,
his
conduct
to
mamma
be
charming
,
and
,
as
regard
myself
,
I
must
say
that
there
have
be
nothing
in
his
behaviour
of
which
even
_
you
_
could
complain
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
attempt
the
slight
familiarity
,
and
I
will
do
him
the
justice
to
say
,
that
,
though
he
have
be
very
attentive
,
he
have
also
be
very
respectful
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
confess
that
,
for
the
last
three
week
,
I
have
think
that
he
mean
something
.
<EOS>
I
may
,
perhaps
,
have
do
more
to
repel
him
;
or
I
may
have
consult
you
earlier
as
to
the
propriety
of
keep
altogether
out
of
his
way
.
<EOS>
but
you
know
,
Amelia
,
how
often
these
thing
lead
to
nothing
,
and
though
I
think
all
along
that
Mr
Gazebee
be
in
earnest
,
I
hardly
like
to
say
anything
about
it
even
to
you
till
I
be
quite
certain
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
advise
me
,
you
know
,
to
accept
his
offer
,
and
if
,
after
that
,
he
have
never
make
it
,
I
should
have
feel
so
foolish
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
he
have
make
it
.
<EOS>
He
come
to
me
yesterday
just
before
dinner
,
in
the
little
drawing
-
room
,
and
tell
me
,
in
the
most
delicate
manner
,
in
word
that
even
you
could
not
have
but
approve
,
that
his
high
ambition
be
to
be
think
worthy
of
my
regard
,
and
that
he
feel
for
me
the
warm
love
,
and
the
most
profound
admiration
,
and
the
deep
respect
.
<EOS>
You
may
say
,
Amelia
,
that
he
be
only
an
attorney
,
and
I
believe
that
he
be
an
attorney
;
but
I
be
sure
you
would
have
esteem
him
<EOS>
have
you
hear
the
very
delicate
way
in
which
he
express
his
sentiment
.
  
<EOS>
something
have
give
me
a
presentiment
of
what
he
be
go
to
do
when
I
see
him
come
into
the
room
,
so
that
I
be
on
my
guard
.
<EOS>
I
try
very
hard
to
show
no
emotion
;
but
I
suppose
I
be
a
little
flurried
,
as
I
once
detect
myself
call
him
Mr
Mortimer
:
<EOS>
his
name
,
you
know
,
be
Mortimer
Gazebee
.
<EOS>
I
ought
not
to
have
do
so
,
certainly
;
but
it
be
not
so
bad
as
if
I
have
call
him
Mortimer
without
the
Mr
,
be
it
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
there
could
possibly
be
a
pretty
christian
name
than
Mortimer
.
<EOS>
well
,
Amelia
,
I
allow
him
to
express
himself
without
interruption
.
<EOS>
He
once
attempt
to
take
my
hand
;
but
even
this
be
do
without
any
assumption
of
familiarity
;
and
when
he
see
that
I
would
not
permit
it
,
he
draw
back
,
and
fix
his
eye
on
the
ground
as
though
he
be
ashamed
even
of
that
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
,
I
have
to
give
him
an
answer
;
and
though
I
have
expect
that
something
of
this
sort
would
take
place
,
I
have
not
make
up
my
mind
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
,
certainly
,
under
any
circumstance
,
accept
him
without
consult
you
.
<EOS>
if
I
really
dislike
him
,
of
course
there
would
be
no
doubt
;
but
I
can
not
say
,
dear
Amelia
,
that
I
do
absolutely
dislike
him
;
and
I
really
think
that
we
would
make
each
other
very
happy
,
if
the
marriage
be
suitable
as
regard
both
our
position
.
  
<EOS>
I
collect
myself
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
I
really
do
think
that
you
would
have
say
that
I
do
not
behave
badly
,
though
the
position
be
rather
try
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
that
,
of
course
,
I
be
flatter
by
his
sentiment
,
though
much
surprised
at
hear
them
;
that
since
I
know
him
,
I
have
esteem
and
value
him
as
an
acquaintance
,
but
that
,
look
on
him
as
a
man
of
business
,
I
have
never
expect
anything
more
.
<EOS>
I
then
endeavour
to
explain
to
him
,
that
I
be
not
perhaps
privilege
,
as
some
other
girl
may
be
,
to
indulge
my
own
feeling
altogether
:
perhaps
that
be
say
too
much
,
and
may
make
him
think
that
I
be
in
love
with
him
;
but
,
from
the
way
I
say
it
,
I
do
not
think
he
would
,
for
I
be
very
much
guard
in
my
manner
,
and
very
collected
;
and
then
I
tell
him
,
that
in
any
proposal
of
marriage
that
may
be
make
to
me
,
it
would
be
my
duty
to
consult
my
family
as
much
,
if
not
more
than
myself
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
of
course
;
and
ask
whether
he
may
speak
to
papa
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
make
him
understand
,
that
in
talk
of
my
family
,
I
do
not
exactly
mean
papa
,
or
even
mamma
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
be
think
of
what
be
due
to
the
name
of
Gresham
.
<EOS>
I
know
very
well
what
papa
would
say
.
<EOS>
He
would
give
his
consent
in
half
a
minute
;
he
be
so
break
-
hearted
by
these
debt
.
<EOS>
and
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
Amelia
,
I
think
mamma
would
too
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
seem
quite
to
comprehend
what
I
mean
;
but
he
do
say
that
he
know
it
be
a
high
ambition
to
marry
into
the
family
of
the
Greshams
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
would
confess
that
he
have
the
most
proper
feeling
;
and
as
for
express
them
no
man
could
do
it
better
.
  
<EOS>
He
own
that
it
be
ambition
to
ally
himself
with
a
family
above
his
own
rank
in
life
,
and
that
he
look
to
do
so
as
a
means
of
advance
himself
.
<EOS>
now
this
be
at
any
rate
honest
.
<EOS>
that
be
one
of
his
motive
,
he
say
;
though
,
of
course
,
not
his
first
:
<EOS>
and
then
he
declare
how
truly
attach
he
be
to
me
.
<EOS>
in
answer
to
this
,
I
remark
,
that
he
have
know
me
only
a
very
short
time
.
<EOS>
this
,
perhaps
,
be
give
him
too
much
encouragement
;
but
,
at
that
moment
,
I
hardly
know
what
to
say
,
for
I
do
not
wish
to
hurt
his
feeling
.
<EOS>
He
then
speak
of
his
income
.
<EOS>
He
have
fifteen
hundred
a
year
from
the
business
,
and
that
will
be
greatly
increase
when
his
father
leave
it
;
and
his
father
be
much
old
than
Mr
Gumption
,
though
he
be
only
the
second
partner
.
<EOS>
Mortimer
Gazebee
will
be
the
senior
partner
himself
before
very
long
;
and
perhaps
that
do
alter
his
position
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
a
very
nice
place
down
somewhere
in
Surrey
;
I
have
hear
mamma
say
it
be
quite
a
gentleman
's
place
.
<EOS>
It
be
let
now
;
but
he
will
live
there
when
he
be
married
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
property
of
his
own
besides
which
he
can
settle
.
<EOS>
so
,
you
see
,
he
be
quite
as
well
off
as
Mr
Oriel
;
well
,
indeed
;
and
if
a
man
be
in
a
profession
,
I
believe
it
be
consider
that
it
do
not
much
matter
what
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
a
clergyman
can
be
a
bishop
;
but
then
,
I
think
I
have
hear
that
one
attorney
do
once
become
Lord
Chancellor
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
my
carriage
,
you
know
;
I
remember
his
saying
that
,
especially
,
though
I
can
not
recollect
how
he
bring
it
in
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
at
last
,
that
I
be
so
much
take
by
surprise
that
I
could
not
give
him
an
answer
then
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
up
to
London
,
he
say
,
on
the
next
day
,
and
may
he
be
permit
to
address
me
on
the
same
subject
when
he
return
?
<EOS>
I
could
not
refuse
him
,
you
know
;
and
so
now
I
have
take
the
opportunity
of
his
absence
to
write
to
you
for
your
advice
.
<EOS>
You
understand
the
world
so
very
well
,
and
know
so
exactly
what
one
ought
to
do
in
such
a
strange
position
!
  
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
make
it
intelligible
,
at
least
,
as
to
what
I
have
write
about
.
<EOS>
I
have
say
nothing
as
to
my
own
feeling
,
because
I
wish
you
to
think
on
the
matter
without
consult
them
.
<EOS>
if
it
would
be
derogatory
to
accept
Mr
Gazebee
,
I
certainly
would
not
do
so
because
I
happen
to
like
him
.
<EOS>
if
we
be
to
act
in
that
way
,
what
would
the
world
come
to
,
Amelia
?
<EOS>
perhaps
my
idea
may
be
overstrain
;
if
so
,
you
will
tell
me
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mr
Oriel
propose
for
Beatrice
,
nobody
seem
to
make
any
objection
.
<EOS>
It
all
seem
to
go
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
She
say
that
his
family
be
excellent
;
but
as
far
as
I
can
learn
,
his
grandfather
be
a
general
in
India
,
and
come
home
very
rich
.
<EOS>
Mr
Gazebee
's
grandfather
be
a
member
of
the
firm
,
and
so
,
I
believe
,
be
his
great
-
grandfather
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
this
ought
to
count
for
something
?
<EOS>
besides
,
they
have
no
business
except
with
the
most
aristocratic
person
,
such
as
uncle
de
Courcy
,
and
the
Marquis
of
Kensington
Gore
,
and
that
sort
.
<EOS>
I
mention
the
marquis
,
because
Mr
Mortimer
Gazebee
be
there
now
.
<EOS>
and
I
know
that
one
of
the
Gumptions
be
once
in
Parliament
;
and
I
do
not
think
that
any
of
the
Oriels
ever
be
.
<EOS>
the
name
of
attorney
be
certainly
very
bad
,
be
it
not
,
Amelia
?
<EOS>
but
they
certainly
do
not
seem
to
be
all
the
same
,
and
I
do
think
that
this
ought
to
make
a
difference
.
<EOS>
to
hear
Mr
Mortimer
Gazebee
talk
of
some
attorney
at
Barchester
,
you
would
say
that
there
be
quite
as
much
difference
between
them
as
between
a
bishop
and
a
curate
.
<EOS>
and
so
I
think
there
be
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
wish
at
all
to
speak
of
my
own
feeling
;
but
if
he
be
not
an
attorney
,
he
be
,
I
think
,
the
sort
of
man
I
should
like
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
nice
in
every
way
,
and
if
you
be
not
tell
,
I
do
not
think
you
would
know
he
be
an
attorney
.
<EOS>
but
,
dear
Amelia
,
I
will
be
guide
by
you
altogether
.
<EOS>
He
be
certainly
much
nice
than
Mr
Moffat
,
and
have
a
great
deal
more
to
say
for
himself
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
Mr
Moffat
have
be
in
Parliament
,
and
have
be
take
up
by
uncle
de
Courcy
,
be
in
a
different
sphere
;
but
I
really
feel
almost
relieved
when
he
behave
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
with
Mortimer
Gazebee
,
I
think
it
would
be
different
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
wait
so
impatiently
for
your
answer
,
<EOS>
so
do
pray
write
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
hear
some
people
say
that
these
sort
of
thing
be
not
so
much
thought
of
now
as
they
be
once
,
and
that
all
manner
of
marriage
be
consider
to
be
_
comme
il
faut
_
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
,
you
know
,
to
make
myself
foolish
by
be
too
particular
.
<EOS>
perhaps
all
these
change
be
bad
,
and
I
rather
think
they
be
;
but
if
the
world
change
,
one
must
change
too
;
one
can
not
go
against
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
so
do
write
and
tell
me
what
you
think
.
<EOS>
do
not
suppose
that
I
dislike
the
man
,
for
I
really
can
not
say
that
I
do
.
<EOS>
but
I
would
not
for
anything
<EOS>
make
an
alliance
for
which
any
one
bear
the
name
of
de
Courcy
would
have
to
blush
.
  
<EOS>
always
,
dear
Amelia
,
  
Your
most
affectionate
cousin
,
  
AUGUSTA
GRESHAM
.
  
<EOS>
P.S.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
Frank
be
go
to
be
very
foolish
with
Mary
Thorne
.
<EOS>
You
know
it
be
absolutely
important
that
Frank
should
marry
money
.
  
<EOS>
It
strike
me
as
quite
possible
that
Mortimer
Gazebee
may
be
in
Parliament
some
of
these
day
.
<EOS>
He
be
just
the
man
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Augusta
pray
very
hard
for
her
husband
;
but
she
pray
to
a
bosom
that
on
this
subject
be
as
hard
as
a
flint
,
and
she
pray
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Augusta
Gresham
be
twenty
-
two
,
Lady
Amelia
de
Courcy
be
thirty
-
four
;
be
it
likely
that
Lady
Amelia
would
permit
Augusta
to
marry
,
the
issue
have
thus
be
leave
in
her
hand
?
<EOS>
why
should
Augusta
derogate
from
her
position
by
marry
beneath
herself
,
see
that
Lady
Amelia
have
spend
so
many
more
year
in
the
world
without
have
find
it
necessary
to
do
so
?
<EOS>
Augusta
's
letter
be
write
on
two
sheet
of
note
-
paper
,
cross
all
over
;
and
Lady
Amelia
's
answer
be
almost
equally
formidable
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Amelia
de
Courcy
<EOS>
to
Miss
Augusta
Gresham
  
<EOS>
Courcy
Castle
,
June
,
185
 
.
  
<EOS>
my
dear
AUGUSTA
,
  
I
receive
your
letter
yesterday
morning
,
but
I
have
put
off
answer
it
till
this
evening
,
as
I
have
wish
to
give
it
very
mature
consideration
.
<EOS>
the
question
be
one
which
concern
,
not
only
your
character
,
but
happiness
for
life
,
and
nothing
less
than
very
mature
consideration
would
justify
me
in
give
a
decide
opinion
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
I
may
tell
you
,
that
I
have
not
a
word
to
say
against
Mr
Mortimer
Gazebee
.
<EOS>
[
when
Augusta
have
read
as
far
as
this
,
her
heart
sink
within
her
;
the
rest
be
all
leather
and
prunella
;
she
see
at
once
that
the
fiat
have
go
against
her
,
and
that
her
wish
to
become
Mrs
Mortimer
Gazebee
<EOS>
be
not
to
be
indulge
.
]
<EOS>
I
have
know
him
for
a
long
time
,
and
I
believe
him
to
be
a
very
respectable
person
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
a
good
man
of
business
.
<EOS>
the
firm
of
Messrs
Gumption
&
Gazebee
stand
probably
quite
among
the
first
attorney
in
London
,
and
I
know
that
papa
have
a
very
high
opinion
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
all
of
these
would
be
excellent
argument
to
use
in
favour
of
Mr
Gazebee
as
a
suitor
,
have
his
proposal
be
make
to
any
one
in
his
own
rank
of
life
.
<EOS>
but
you
,
in
consider
the
matter
,
should
,
I
think
,
look
on
it
in
a
very
different
light
.
<EOS>
the
very
fact
that
you
pronounce
him
to
be
so
much
superior
to
other
attorney
,
show
in
how
very
low
esteem
you
hold
the
profession
in
general
.
<EOS>
It
show
also
,
dear
Augusta
,
how
well
aware
you
be
that
they
be
a
class
of
people
among
whom
you
should
not
seek
a
partner
for
life
.
  
<EOS>
My
opinion
be
,
that
you
should
make
Mr
Gazebee
understand
 
very
courteously
,
of
course
 
that
you
can
not
accept
his
hand
.
<EOS>
You
observe
that
he
himself
confess
,
that
in
marry
you
he
would
seek
a
wife
in
a
rank
above
his
own
.
<EOS>
be
it
not
,
therefore
,
clear
,
that
in
marry
him
,
you
would
descend
to
a
rank
below
your
own
?
  
<EOS>
I
shall
be
very
sorry
if
this
grieve
you
;
but
still
it
will
be
well
that
you
should
bear
the
grief
of
overcome
a
temporary
fancy
,
than
take
a
step
which
may
so
probably
make
you
unhappy
;
and
which
some
of
your
friend
would
certainly
regard
as
disgraceful
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
permit
to
us
,
my
dear
Augusta
,
to
think
of
ourselves
in
such
matter
.
<EOS>
as
you
truly
say
,
if
we
be
to
act
in
that
way
,
what
would
the
world
come
to
?
<EOS>
It
have
be
God
's
pleasure
that
we
should
be
bear
with
high
blood
in
our
vein
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
great
boon
which
we
both
value
,
but
the
boon
have
its
responsibility
as
well
as
its
privilege
.
<EOS>
It
be
establish
by
law
,
that
the
royal
family
shall
not
intermarry
with
subject
.
<EOS>
in
our
case
there
be
no
law
,
but
the
necessity
be
not
the
less
felt
;
we
should
not
intermarry
with
those
who
be
probably
of
a
low
rank
.
<EOS>
Mr
Mortimer
Gazebee
be
,
after
all
,
only
an
attorney
;
and
,
although
you
speak
of
his
great
-
grandfather
,
he
be
a
man
of
no
blood
whatsoever
.
<EOS>
You
must
acknowledge
that
such
an
admixture
should
be
look
on
by
a
de
Courcy
,
or
even
by
a
Gresham
,
as
a
pollution
.
<EOS>
[
here
Augusta
get
very
red
,
and
she
feel
almost
inclined
to
be
angry
with
her
cousin
.
]
<EOS>
Beatrice
's
marriage
with
Mr
Oriel
be
different
;
though
,
remember
,
I
be
by
no
mean
defend
that
;
it
may
be
good
or
bad
,
and
I
have
have
no
opportunity
of
inquire
respect
Mr
Oriel
's
family
.
<EOS>
Beatrice
,
moreover
,
have
never
appear
to
me
to
feel
what
be
due
to
herself
in
such
matter
;
but
,
as
I
say
,
her
marriage
with
Mr
Oriel
be
very
different
.
<EOS>
clergyman
 
particularly
the
rector
and
vicar
of
country
parish
 
<EOS>
do
become
privileged
above
other
professional
man
.
<EOS>
I
could
explain
why
,
but
it
would
be
too
long
in
a
letter
.
  
<EOS>
Your
feeling
on
the
subject
altogether
do
you
great
credit
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
that
Mr
Gresham
,
if
ask
,
would
accede
to
the
match
;
but
that
be
just
the
reason
why
he
should
not
be
ask
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
right
that
I
should
say
anything
against
your
father
to
you
;
but
it
be
impossible
for
any
of
us
not
to
see
that
all
through
life
he
have
throw
away
every
advantage
,
and
sacrifice
his
family
.
<EOS>
why
be
he
now
in
debt
,
as
you
say
?
<EOS>
why
be
he
not
hold
the
family
seat
in
Parliament
?
<EOS>
even
though
you
be
his
daughter
,
you
can
not
but
feel
that
you
would
not
do
right
to
consult
him
on
such
a
subject
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
dear
aunt
,
I
feel
sure
,
that
be
she
in
good
health
,
and
leave
to
exercise
her
own
judgement
,
she
would
not
wish
to
see
you
married
to
the
agent
for
the
family
estate
.
<EOS>
for
,
dear
Augusta
,
that
be
the
real
truth
.
<EOS>
Mr
Gazebee
often
come
here
in
the
way
of
business
;
and
though
papa
always
receive
him
as
a
gentleman
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
he
dine
at
table
and
all
that
 
<EOS>
he
be
not
on
the
same
footing
in
the
house
as
the
ordinary
guest
and
friend
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
how
would
you
like
to
be
receive
at
Courcy
Castle
in
the
same
way
?
  
<EOS>
You
will
say
,
perhaps
,
that
you
would
still
be
papa
's
niece
;
so
you
would
.
<EOS>
but
you
know
how
strict
in
such
matter
papa
be
,
and
you
must
remember
,
that
the
wife
always
follow
the
rank
of
the
husband
.
<EOS>
Papa
be
accustomed
to
the
strict
etiquette
of
a
court
,
and
I
be
sure
that
no
consideration
would
induce
him
to
receive
the
estate
-
agent
in
the
light
of
a
nephew
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
be
you
to
marry
Mr
Gazebee
,
the
house
to
which
he
belong
would
<EOS>
,
I
imagine
,
have
to
give
up
the
management
of
this
property
.
  
<EOS>
even
be
Mr
Gazebee
in
Parliament
 
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
see
how
it
be
probable
that
he
should
get
there
 
<EOS>
it
would
not
make
any
difference
.
<EOS>
You
must
remember
,
dear
,
that
I
never
be
an
advocate
for
the
moffat
match
.
<EOS>
I
acquiesce
in
it
,
because
mamma
do
so
.
<EOS>
if
I
could
have
have
my
own
way
,
I
would
adhere
to
all
our
old
prescriptive
principle
.
<EOS>
neither
money
nor
position
can
atone
to
me
for
low
birth
.
<EOS>
but
the
world
,
alas
!
be
retrograde
;
and
,
accord
to
the
new
-
fangle
doctrine
of
the
day
,
a
lady
of
blood
be
not
disgrace
by
ally
herself
to
a
man
of
wealth
,
and
what
may
be
call
quasi
-
aristocratic
position
.
<EOS>
I
wish
it
be
otherwise
;
but
so
it
be
.
<EOS>
and
,
therefore
,
the
match
with
Mr
Moffat
be
not
disgraceful
,
though
it
could
not
be
regard
as
altogether
satisfactory
.
  
<EOS>
but
with
Mr
Gazebee
the
matter
would
be
altogether
different
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
earn
his
bread
;
honestly
,
I
dare
say
,
but
in
a
humble
position
.
<EOS>
You
say
he
be
very
respectable
:
I
do
not
doubt
it
;
and
so
be
Mr
Scraggs
,
the
butcher
at
Courcy
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
Augusta
,
to
what
such
argument
reduce
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
may
be
nice
than
Mr
Moffat
,
in
one
way
.
<EOS>
that
is
,
he
may
have
more
small
-
talk
at
his
command
,
and
be
more
clever
in
all
those
little
pursuit
and
amusement
which
be
value
by
ordinary
young
lady
.
<EOS>
but
my
opinion
be
,
that
neither
I
nor
you
would
be
justify
in
sacrifice
ourselves
for
such
amusement
.
<EOS>
We
have
high
duty
before
us
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
the
performance
of
those
duty
will
prohibit
us
from
take
a
part
in
the
ordinary
arena
of
the
feminine
world
.
<EOS>
It
be
natural
that
girl
should
wish
to
marry
;
and
,
therefore
,
those
who
be
weak
,
take
the
first
that
come
.
<EOS>
those
who
have
more
judgement
,
make
some
sort
of
selection
.
<EOS>
but
the
strong
-
minded
be
,
perhaps
,
those
who
be
able
to
forgo
themselves
and
their
own
fancy
,
and
to
refrain
from
any
alliance
that
do
not
tend
to
the
maintenance
of
high
principle
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
I
speak
of
those
who
have
blood
in
their
vein
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
need
not
dilate
as
to
the
conduct
of
other
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
what
I
have
say
will
convince
you
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
know
that
it
only
require
that
you
and
I
should
have
a
little
cousinly
talk
on
this
matter
to
be
quite
in
accord
.
<EOS>
You
must
now
remain
at
Greshamsbury
till
Mr
Gazebee
shall
return
.
<EOS>
immediately
that
he
do
so
,
seek
an
interview
with
him
;
do
not
wait
till
he
ask
for
it
;
then
tell
him
,
that
when
he
address
you
,
the
matter
have
take
you
so
much
by
surprise
,
that
you
be
not
at
the
moment
able
to
answer
him
with
that
decision
that
the
subject
demand
.
<EOS>
tell
him
,
that
you
be
flatter
 
in
say
this
,
however
,
you
must
keep
a
collect
countenance
,
and
be
very
cold
in
your
manner
 
but
that
family
reason
would
forbid
you
to
avail
yourself
of
his
offer
,
even
do
no
other
cause
prevent
it
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
,
dear
Augusta
,
come
to
us
here
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
be
a
little
down
-
hearted
after
go
through
this
struggle
;
but
I
will
endeavour
to
inspirit
you
.
<EOS>
when
we
be
both
together
,
you
will
feel
more
sensibly
the
value
of
that
high
position
which
you
will
preserve
by
reject
Mr
Gazebee
,
and
will
regret
less
acutely
whatever
you
may
lose
.
  
<EOS>
Your
very
affectionate
cousin
,
  
AMELIA
DE
COURCY
.
  
<EOS>
P.S.
 
<EOS>
I
be
greatly
grieve
about
Frank
;
but
I
have
long
fear
that
he
would
do
some
very
silly
thing
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
lately
that
Miss
Mary
Thorne
be
not
even
the
legitimate
niece
of
your
Dr
Thorne
,
but
be
the
daughter
of
some
poor
creature
who
be
seduce
by
the
doctor
,
in
Barchester
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
true
this
may
be
,
but
I
think
your
brother
should
be
put
on
his
guard
:
it
may
do
good
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Augusta
!
<EOS>
She
be
in
truth
to
be
pity
,
for
her
effort
be
make
with
the
intention
of
do
right
accord
to
her
light
.
<EOS>
for
Mr
Moffat
she
have
never
care
a
straw
;
and
when
,
therefore
,
she
lose
the
piece
of
gilding
for
which
she
have
be
instruct
by
her
mother
to
sell
herself
,
it
be
impossible
to
pity
her
.
<EOS>
but
Mr
Gazebee
she
would
have
love
with
that
sort
of
love
which
it
be
in
her
power
to
bestow
.
<EOS>
with
him
she
would
have
be
happy
,
respectable
,
and
contented
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
write
her
letter
with
great
care
.
<EOS>
when
the
offer
be
make
to
her
,
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
throw
Lady
Amelia
to
the
wind
and
marry
the
man
,
as
it
be
,
out
of
her
own
head
.
<EOS>
Lady
Amelia
have
be
the
tyrant
of
her
life
,
and
so
she
strove
hard
to
obtain
her
tyrant
's
permission
.
<EOS>
She
use
all
her
little
cunning
in
show
that
,
after
all
,
Mr
Gazebee
be
not
so
very
plebeian
.
<EOS>
all
her
little
cunning
be
utterly
worthless
.
<EOS>
Lady
Amelia
's
mind
be
too
strong
to
be
catch
with
such
chaff
.
<EOS>
Augusta
could
not
serve
God
and
Mammon
.
<EOS>
She
must
either
be
true
to
the
god
of
her
cousin
's
idolatry
,
and
remain
single
,
or
serve
the
Mammon
of
her
own
inclination
,
and
marry
Mr
Gazebee
.
  
<EOS>
when
refolde
her
cousin
's
letter
,
after
the
first
perusal
,
she
do
for
a
moment
think
of
rebellion
.
<EOS>
Could
she
not
be
happy
at
the
nice
place
in
Surrey
,
have
,
as
she
would
have
,
a
carriage
,
even
though
all
the
de
Courcys
should
drop
her
?
<EOS>
It
have
be
put
to
her
that
she
would
not
like
to
be
receive
at
Courcy
Castle
with
the
scant
civility
which
would
be
consider
due
to
a
Mrs
Mortimer
Gazebee
;
but
what
if
she
could
put
up
without
be
receive
at
Courcy
Castle
at
all
?
<EOS>
such
idea
do
float
through
her
mind
,
dimly
.
  
<EOS>
but
her
courage
fail
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
hard
to
throw
off
a
tyrant
;
so
much
easy
to
yield
,
when
we
have
be
in
the
habit
of
yield
.
<EOS>
this
third
letter
,
therefore
,
be
write
;
and
it
be
the
end
of
the
correspondence
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Augusta
Gresham
to
Lady
Amelia
de
Courcy
  
Greshamsbury
House
,
July
,
185
 
.
  
<EOS>
my
dearest
amelia
,
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
answer
your
letter
before
,
because
I
think
it
better
to
delay
do
so
till
Mr
Gazebee
have
be
here
.
<EOS>
He
come
the
day
before
yesterday
,
and
yesterday
I
do
,
as
nearly
as
possible
,
what
you
advise
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
on
the
whole
,
it
will
be
well
.
<EOS>
as
you
say
,
rank
have
its
responsibility
as
well
as
its
privilege
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
quite
understand
what
you
mean
about
clergyman
,
but
we
can
talk
that
over
when
we
meet
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
seem
to
me
that
if
one
be
to
be
particular
about
family
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
sure
I
think
we
ought
 
one
ought
to
be
so
without
exception
.
<EOS>
if
Mr
Oriel
be
a
_
parvenu
_
,
Beatrice
's
child
will
not
be
well
bear
merely
because
their
father
be
a
clergyman
,
even
though
he
be
a
rector
.
<EOS>
since
my
former
letter
,
I
have
hear
that
Mr
Gazebee
's
great
-
great
-
great
-
grandfather
establish
the
firm
;
and
there
be
many
people
who
be
nobody
then
who
be
think
to
have
good
blood
in
their
vein
now
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
say
this
because
I
differ
from
you
.
<EOS>
I
agree
with
you
so
fully
,
that
I
at
once
make
up
my
mind
to
reject
the
man
;
and
,
consequently
,
I
have
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
tell
him
I
could
not
accept
him
from
family
consideration
,
he
ask
me
whether
I
have
speak
to
papa
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
no
;
and
that
it
would
be
no
good
,
as
I
have
make
up
my
own
mind
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
he
quite
understand
me
;
but
it
do
not
perhaps
much
matter
.
<EOS>
You
tell
me
to
be
very
cold
,
and
I
think
that
perhaps
he
think
me
less
gracious
than
before
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
fear
that
when
he
first
speak
,
I
may
seem
to
have
give
him
too
much
encouragement
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
all
over
now
;
quite
over
!
<EOS>
[
as
Augusta
write
this
,
she
barely
manage
to
save
the
paper
beneath
her
hand
from
be
moisten
with
the
tear
which
escape
from
her
eye
.
]
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
mind
confess
now
,
[
she
continue
]
at
any
rate
to
you
,
that
I
do
like
Mr
Gazebee
a
little
.
<EOS>
I
think
his
temper
and
disposition
would
have
suit
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
quite
satisfied
that
I
have
do
right
.
<EOS>
He
try
very
hard
to
make
me
change
my
mind
.
<EOS>
that
is
,
he
say
a
great
many
thing
as
to
whether
I
would
not
put
off
my
decision
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
quite
firm
.
<EOS>
I
must
say
that
he
behave
very
well
,
and
that
I
really
do
think
he
like
me
honestly
and
truly
;
but
,
of
course
,
I
could
not
sacrifice
family
consideration
on
that
account
.
  
<EOS>
yes
,
rank
have
its
responsibility
as
well
as
its
privilege
.
<EOS>
I
will
remember
that
.
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
to
do
so
,
as
otherwise
one
would
be
without
consolation
for
what
one
have
to
suffer
.
<EOS>
for
I
find
that
one
have
to
suffer
,
Amelia
.
<EOS>
I
know
papa
would
have
advise
me
to
marry
this
man
;
and
so
,
I
dare
say
,
mamma
would
,
and
Frank
,
and
Beatrice
,
if
they
know
that
I
like
him
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
so
bad
if
we
all
think
alike
about
it
;
but
it
be
hard
to
have
the
responsibility
all
on
one
's
own
shoulder
;
be
it
not
?
  
<EOS>
but
I
will
go
over
to
you
,
and
you
will
comfort
me
.
<EOS>
I
always
feel
strong
on
this
subject
at
Courcy
than
at
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
We
will
have
a
long
talk
about
it
,
and
then
I
shall
be
happy
again
.
<EOS>
I
purpose
go
on
next
Friday
,
if
that
will
suit
you
and
dear
aunt
.
<EOS>
I
have
tell
mamma
that
you
all
want
me
,
and
she
make
no
objection
.
<EOS>
do
write
at
once
,
dear
Amelia
,
for
to
hear
from
you
now
will
be
my
only
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
,
ever
most
affectionately
and
oblige
,
  
AUGUSTA
GRESHAM
.
  
<EOS>
P.S.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
mamma
what
you
say
about
Mary
Thorne
,
and
she
say
,
"
yes
;
I
suppose
all
the
world
know
it
now
;
and
if
all
the
world
do
know
it
,
it
make
no
difference
to
Frank
.
"
<EOS>
She
seem
very
angry
;
so
you
see
it
be
true
.
  
<EOS>
though
,
by
so
do
,
we
shall
somewhat
anticipate
the
end
of
our
story
,
it
may
be
desirable
that
the
full
tale
of
Mr
Gazebee
's
love
should
be
tell
here
.
<EOS>
when
Mary
be
break
her
heart
on
her
death
-
bed
in
the
last
chapter
,
or
otherwise
accomplish
her
destiny
,
we
shall
hardly
find
a
fit
opportunity
of
say
much
about
Mr
Gazebee
and
his
aristocratic
bride
.
  
<EOS>
for
he
do
succeed
at
last
in
obtain
a
bride
in
whose
vein
run
the
noble
ichor
of
de
Courcy
blood
,
in
spite
of
the
high
doctrine
preach
so
eloquently
by
the
Lady
Amelia
.
<EOS>
as
Augusta
have
truly
say
,
he
have
fail
to
understand
her
.
<EOS>
He
be
lead
to
think
,
by
her
manner
of
receive
his
first
proposal
 
and
justly
so
,
enough
 
that
she
like
him
,
and
would
accept
him
;
and
he
be
,
therefore
,
rather
perplex
by
his
second
interview
.
<EOS>
He
try
again
and
again
,
and
beg
permission
to
mention
the
matter
to
Mr
Gresham
;
but
Augusta
be
very
firm
,
and
he
at
last
retire
in
disgust
.
<EOS>
Augusta
go
to
Courcy
Castle
,
and
receive
from
her
cousin
that
consolation
and
re
-
strengthening
which
she
so
much
require
.
  
<EOS>
four
year
afterwards
 
long
after
the
fate
of
Mary
Thorne
have
fall
,
like
a
thunderbolt
,
on
the
inhabitant
of
Greshamsbury
;
when
Beatrice
be
prepare
for
her
second
baby
,
and
each
of
the
twin
have
her
accept
lover
 
<EOS>
Mr
Mortimer
Gazebee
go
down
to
Courcy
Castle
;
of
course
,
on
matter
of
business
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
he
dine
at
the
table
,
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
We
have
the
word
of
Lady
Amelia
,
that
the
earl
,
with
his
usual
good
-
nature
,
allow
him
such
privilege
.
<EOS>
let
us
hope
that
he
never
encroach
on
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
on
this
occasion
,
Mr
Gazebee
stay
a
long
time
at
the
castle
,
and
singular
rumour
as
to
the
cause
of
his
prolonged
visit
become
current
in
the
little
town
.
<EOS>
no
female
scion
of
the
present
family
of
Courcy
have
,
as
yet
,
find
a
mate
.
<EOS>
We
may
imagine
that
eagle
find
it
difficult
to
pair
when
they
become
scarce
in
their
locality
;
and
we
all
know
how
hard
it
have
sometimes
be
to
get
_
comme
il
faut
_
husband
when
there
have
be
any
number
of
protestant
princess
on
hand
.
  
<EOS>
some
such
difficulty
have
,
doubtless
,
bring
it
about
that
the
countess
be
still
surround
by
her
full
bevy
of
maiden
.
<EOS>
Rank
have
its
responsibility
as
well
as
its
privilege
,
and
these
young
lady
"
responsibility
seem
to
have
consist
in
reject
any
suitor
who
may
have
hitherto
kneel
to
them
.
<EOS>
but
now
it
be
tell
through
Courcy
,
that
one
suitor
have
kneel
,
and
not
in
vain
;
from
Courcy
the
rumour
fly
to
Barchester
,
and
thence
come
down
to
Greshamsbury
,
startle
the
inhabitant
,
and
make
one
poor
heart
throb
with
a
violence
that
would
have
be
piteous
have
it
be
know
.
<EOS>
the
suitor
,
so
name
,
be
Mr
Mortimer
Gazebee
.
  
<EOS>
yes
<EOS>
;
Mr
Mortimer
Gazebee
have
now
award
to
him
many
other
privilege
than
those
of
dining
at
the
table
,
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
He
ride
with
the
young
lady
in
the
park
,
and
they
all
talk
to
him
very
familiarly
before
company
;
all
except
the
Lady
Amelia
.
<EOS>
the
countess
even
call
him
Mortimer
,
and
treat
him
quite
as
one
of
the
family
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
come
a
letter
from
the
countess
to
her
dear
sister
Arabella
.
<EOS>
It
should
be
give
at
length
,
but
that
I
fear
to
introduce
another
epistle
.
<EOS>
It
be
such
an
easy
mode
of
writing
,
and
facility
be
always
dangerous
.
<EOS>
in
this
letter
it
be
announce
with
much
preliminary
ambiguity
,
that
Mortimer
Gazebee
 
who
have
be
find
to
be
a
treasure
in
every
way
;
quite
a
paragon
of
man
 
be
about
to
be
take
into
the
de
Courcy
bosom
as
a
child
of
that
house
.
<EOS>
on
that
day
fortnight
,
he
be
destine
to
lead
to
the
altar
 
the
Lady
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
the
countess
then
go
on
to
say
,
that
dear
Amelia
do
not
write
herself
,
be
so
much
engage
by
her
come
duty
 
<EOS>
the
responsibility
of
which
she
doubtless
fully
realise
,
as
well
as
the
privilege
;
but
she
have
beg
her
mother
to
request
that
the
twin
should
come
and
act
as
bridesmaid
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
Dear
Augusta
,
she
know
,
be
too
much
occupy
in
the
come
event
in
Mr
Oriel
's
family
to
be
able
to
attend
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Mortimer
Gazebee
be
take
into
the
de
Courcy
family
,
and
do
lead
the
Lady
Amelia
to
the
altar
;
and
the
Gresham
twin
do
go
there
and
act
as
bridesmaid
.
<EOS>
and
,
which
be
much
more
to
say
for
human
nature
,
Augusta
do
forgive
her
cousin
,
and
,
after
a
certain
interval
,
go
on
a
visit
to
that
nice
place
in
Surrey
which
she
have
once
hope
would
be
her
own
home
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
a
very
nice
place
,
Augusta
think
,
<EOS>
have
not
Lady
Amelia
Gazebee
be
so
very
economical
.
  
<EOS>
We
must
presume
that
there
be
some
explanation
between
them
.
<EOS>
if
so
,
Augusta
yield
to
it
,
and
confess
it
to
be
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
She
have
always
yield
to
her
cousin
,
and
love
her
with
that
sort
of
love
which
be
beget
between
fear
and
respect
.
<EOS>
anything
be
well
than
quarrel
with
her
cousin
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
and
Mr
Mortimer
Gazebee
do
not
altogether
make
a
bad
bargain
.
<EOS>
He
never
receive
a
shilling
of
dowry
,
but
that
he
have
not
expect
.
<EOS>
nor
do
he
want
it
.
<EOS>
His
trouble
arise
from
the
overstrained
economy
of
his
noble
wife
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
it
,
that
as
she
have
marry
a
poor
man
 
Mr
Gazebee
,
however
,
be
not
a
poor
man
 
<EOS>
it
behove
her
to
manage
her
house
with
great
care
.
<EOS>
such
a
match
as
that
she
have
make
 
this
she
tell
in
confidence
to
Augusta
 
have
its
responsibility
as
well
as
its
privilege
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
on
the
whole
,
Mr
Gazebee
do
not
repent
his
bargain
;
when
he
ask
his
friend
to
dine
,
he
could
tell
them
that
Lady
Amelia
would
be
very
glad
to
see
them
;
his
marriage
give
him
some
éclat
at
his
club
,
and
some
additional
weight
in
the
firm
to
which
he
belong
;
he
get
his
share
of
the
Courcy
shooting
,
and
be
ask
about
to
Greshamsbury
and
other
Barsetshire
house
,
not
only
"
to
dine
at
table
and
all
that
,
"
but
to
take
his
part
in
whatever
delight
country
society
there
have
to
offer
.
<EOS>
He
live
with
the
great
hope
that
his
noble
father
-
in
-
law
may
some
day
be
able
to
bring
him
into
Parliament
.
   
<EOS>
what
the
World
say
about
blood
 
"
Beatrice
,
"
say
Frank
,
rush
suddenly
into
his
sister
's
room
<EOS>
,
"
I
want
you
to
do
me
one
especial
favour
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
three
or
four
day
after
Frank
have
see
Mary
Thorne
.
<EOS>
since
that
time
he
have
speak
to
none
of
his
family
on
the
subject
;
but
he
be
only
postpone
from
day
to
day
the
task
of
tell
his
father
.
<EOS>
He
have
now
complete
his
round
of
visit
to
the
kennel
,
master
huntsman
,
and
stable
of
the
county
hunt
,
and
be
at
liberty
to
attend
to
his
own
affair
.
<EOS>
so
he
have
decide
on
speak
to
the
squire
that
very
day
;
but
he
first
make
his
request
to
his
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
to
do
me
one
especial
favour
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
day
for
Beatrice
's
marriage
have
now
be
fix
,
and
it
be
not
to
be
very
distant
.
<EOS>
Mr
Oriel
have
urge
that
their
honeymoon
trip
would
lose
half
its
delight
if
they
do
not
take
advantage
of
the
fine
weather
;
and
Beatrice
have
nothing
to
allege
in
answer
.
<EOS>
the
day
have
just
be
fix
,
and
when
Frank
run
into
her
room
with
his
special
request
,
she
be
not
in
a
humour
to
refuse
him
anything
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
wish
me
to
be
at
your
wedding
,
you
must
do
it
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
wish
you
to
be
there
!
<EOS>
You
must
be
there
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Frank
!
<EOS>
what
do
you
mean

you

Frank

have

use

obey

<EOS>
on
this
occasion

she
be
well

again
remember

Beatrice
promise
that

again

that
she
would
endeavour
to
talk
her
mother
over
if
Mary
would
consent

come

but
she
could
not
yet
make
herself
believe
that
Mary
Thorne
would
ever
be
mistress
of
Greshamsbury

<EOS>
It
be
so
indispensably
necessary
that
Frank
should
marry
money
!
<EOS>
besides
,
what
be
those
horrid
rumour
which
be
now
become
rife
as
to
Mary
's
birth
;
rumour
more
horrid
than
any
which
have
yet
be
hear
?
  
<EOS>
Augusta
have
say
hardly
more
than
the
truth
when
she
speak
of
her
father
be
break
-
hearted
by
his
debt
.
<EOS>
His
trouble
be
become
almost
too
many
for
him
;
and
Mr
Gazebee
,
though
no
doubt
he
be
an
excellent
man
of
business
,
do
not
seem
to
lessen
them
.
<EOS>
Mr
Gazebee
,
indeed
,
be
continually
point
out
how
much
he
owe
,
and
in
what
a
quagmire
of
difficulty
he
have
entangle
himself
.
<EOS>
now
,
to
do
Mr
Yates
Umbleby
justice
,
he
have
never
make
himself
disagreeable
in
this
manner
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Gazebee
have
be
doubtless
right
,
when
he
declare
that
Sir
Louis
Scatcherd
have
not
himself
the
power
to
take
any
step
hostile
to
the
squire
;
but
Sir
Louis
have
also
be
right
,
when
he
boast
that
,
in
spite
of
his
father
's
will
,
he
could
cause
other
to
move
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
other
do
move
,
and
be
move
,
and
it
begin
to
be
understand
that
a
moiety
,
at
least
,
of
the
remain
Greshamsbury
property
must
be
sell
.
<EOS>
even
this
,
however
,
would
by
no
mean
leave
the
squire
in
undisturbed
possession
of
the
other
moiety
.
<EOS>
and
thus
,
Mr
Gresham
be
nearly
break
-
hearted
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
have
now
be
at
home
a
week
,
and
his
father
have
not
as
yet
speak
to
him
about
the
family
trouble
;
nor
have
a
word
as
yet
be
say
between
them
as
to
Mary
Thorne
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
agree
that
Frank
should
go
away
for
twelve
month
,
in
order
that
he
may
forget
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
away
the
twelvemonth
,
and
have
now
return
,
not
have
forget
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
generally
happen
,
that
in
every
household
,
one
subject
of
importance
occupy
it
at
a
time
.
<EOS>
the
subject
of
importance
now
mostly
think
of
in
the
Greshamsbury
household
,
be
the
marriage
of
Beatrice
.
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
have
to
supply
the
trousseau
for
her
daughter
;
the
squire
have
to
supply
the
money
for
the
trousseau
;
Mr
Gazebee
have
the
task
of
obtain
the
money
for
the
squire
.
<EOS>
while
this
be
go
on
,
Mr
Gresham
be
not
anxious
to
talk
to
his
son
,
either
about
his
own
debt
or
his
son
's
love
.
<EOS>
there
would
be
time
for
these
thing
when
the
marriage
-
feast
should
be
over
.
  
<EOS>
so
think
the
father
,
but
the
matter
be
precipitate
by
Frank
.
<EOS>
He
also
have
put
off
the
declaration
which
he
have
to
make
,
partly
from
a
wish
to
spare
the
squire
,
but
partly
also
with
a
view
to
spare
himself
.
<EOS>
We
have
all
some
of
that
cowardice
which
induce
us
to
postpone
an
inevitably
evil
day
.
<EOS>
at
this
time
the
discussion
as
to
Beatrice
's
wedding
be
frequent
in
the
house
,
and
at
one
of
them
Frank
have
hear
his
mother
repeat
the
name
of
the
propose
bridesmaid
.
<EOS>
Mary
's
name
be
not
among
them
,
and
hence
have
arise
his
attack
on
his
sister
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
have
have
her
reason
for
name
the
list
before
her
son
;
but
she
overshoot
her
mark
.
<EOS>
She
wish
to
show
him
how
totally
Mary
be
forget
at
Greshamsbury
;
but
she
only
inspire
him
with
a
resolve
that
she
should
not
be
forget
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
go
to
his
sister
;
and
then
,
the
subject
be
full
on
his
mind
,
he
resolve
at
once
to
discuss
it
with
his
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
be
you
at
leisure
for
five
minute
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
enter
the
room
in
which
the
squire
be
accustom
to
sit
majestically
,
to
receive
his
tenant
,
scold
his
dependant
,
and
in
which
,
in
former
happy
day
,
he
have
always
arrange
the
meet
of
the
Barsetshire
hunt
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Gresham
be
quite
at
leisure
:
when
be
he
not
so
?
<EOS>
but
have
he
be
immerse
in
the
deep
business
of
which
he
be
capable
,
he
would
gladly
have
put
it
aside
at
his
son
's
instance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
to
have
any
secret
from
you
,
sir
,
"
say
Frank
;
"
nor
,
for
the
matter
of
that
,
from
anybody
else
"
 
the
anybody
else
be
intend
to
have
reference
to
his
mother
 
"
and
,
therefore
,
I
would
rather
tell
you
at
once
what
I
have
make
up
my
mind
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
's
address
be
very
abrupt
,
and
he
feel
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
He
be
rather
red
in
the
face
,
and
his
manner
be
flutter
.
<EOS>
He
have
quite
make
up
his
mind
to
break
the
whole
affair
to
his
father
;
but
he
have
hardly
make
up
his
mind
as
to
the
good
mode
of
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
heaven
,
Frank
!
<EOS>
what
do
you

<EOS>
"
nothing
immediately

he
,
rather
abash

<EOS>
but
as
I
have
make
up
my
mind
about
Mary
Thorne

quite
make
up
my
mind

I
think
it
right
to
tell
you
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
about
Mary

"
say
the
squire
,
almost
relieved
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
Frank
,
in
voluble
language
,
which
he
hardly
,
however
,
have
quite
under
his
command
,
tell
his
father
all
that
have
pass
between
him
and
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
it
be
fix
now
,
and
can
not
be
alter

<EOS>
nor
must
it
be
alter

<EOS>
You
ask
me
to
go
away
for
twelve
month
,
and
I
have
do
so
.
<EOS>
It
have
make
no
difference
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
as
to
our
mean
of
living
,
I
be
quite
willing
to
do
anything
that
may
be
good
and
most
prudent
.
<EOS>
I
be
think
,
sir
,
of
take
a
farm
somewhere
near
here
,
and
live
on
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
squire
sit
quite
silent
for
some
moment
after
this
communication
have
be
make
to
him
.
<EOS>
Frank
's
conduct
,
as
a
son
,
have
be
such
that
he
could
not
find
fault
with
it
;
and
,
in
this
special
matter
of
his
love
,
how
be
it
possible
for
him
to
find
fault
?
<EOS>
He
himself
be
almost
as
fond
of
Mary
as
of
a
daughter
;
and
,
though
he
too
would
have
be
desirous
that
his
son
should
relieve
the
estate
from
its
embarrassment
by
a
rich
marriage
,
he
do
not
at
all
share
Lady
Arabella
's
feeling
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
no
Countess
de
Courcy
have
ever
engrave
it
on
the
tablet
of
his
mind
that
the
world
would
come
to
ruin
if
Frank
do
not
marry
money
.
<EOS>
Ruin
there
be
,
and
would
be
,
but
it
have
be
bring
about
by
no
sin
of
Frank
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
remember
about
her
birth
,
Frank

"
<EOS>
he
say
,
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir

everything

She
tell
me
all
she
know

Dr
Thorne
finish
the

what
do
you
think

it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

It
be
a
pity

a
misfortune

It
may
,
perhaps
,
have
be
a
reason
why
you
or
my
mother
should
not
have
have
Mary
in
the
house
many
year
ago

it
can
not
make
any
difference
now

"
  
<EOS>
Frank
have
not
mean
to
lean
so
heavily
on
his
father

he
do
do
so

<EOS>
the
story
have
never
be
tell
to
Lady
Arabella
;
be
not
even
known
to
her
now
,
positively
,
and
on
good
authority

Mr
Gresham
have
always
know
it
.
<EOS>
if
Mary
's
birth
be
so
great
a
stain
upon
her
,
why
have
he
bring
her
into
his
house
among
his
child
?
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
misfortune
,
Frank
;
a
very
great
misfortune

It
will
not
do
for
you

birth

too
much
of
the
value

position
depend
upon
it

but
what
be
Mr

birth

say
Frank

almost
with
scorn

"
or
what
Miss
Dunstable
's
?
<EOS>
"
he
would
have
add
,
have
it
not

him
to
the
oil
of

true

Frank

yet
,
what
you

take
the

do
not

not

<EOS>
My

will
have
a
right
to
take
rank
in
the
world

however
she
be
bear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well

poor
in
that
way

be
she
an

if

so

to
postpone

seem
to
him

up

be
greatly
distressed
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
any
feeling
of
animosity
against
his
father
with
reference
to
the
property
,
and
would
have
do
anything
to
make
the
squire
understand
this
,
short
of
give
up
his
engagement
to
Mary
.
<EOS>
His
feeling
rather
be
,
that
,
as
each
have
a
case
against
the
other
,
they
should
cry
quit
;
that
he
should
forgive
his
father
for
his
bad
management
,
on
condition
that
he
himself
be
to
be
forgive
with
regard
to
his
determined
marriage
.
<EOS>
not
that
he
put
it
exactly
in
that
shape
,
even
to
himself
;
but
could
he
have
unravel
his
own
thought
,
he
would
have
find
that
such
be
the
web
on
which
they
be
base
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father
,
I
do
regard
what
you
say

you
would
not
have
me
be
false

have
you
double
the
property
instead
of
lessen
it
,
I
could
not
regard
what
you
say
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
able
to
speak
in
a
very
different
tone
;
I
feel
that

Frank
.
<EOS>

"
do
not
feel
it
any
more

sir

say
what
you
wish
,
as
you
would
have
say
it
under
any
other
circumstance
;
and
pray
believe
this
,
the
idea
never
occur
to
me
,
that
I
have
ground
of
complaint
as
regard
the
property

never

whatever
trouble
we
may
have

do
not
let
that
trouble
you

<EOS>
soon
after
this
Frank
leave
him
.
<EOS>
what
more
be
there
that
could
be
say
between
them
?
<EOS>
They
could
not
be
of
one
accord
;
but
even
yet
it
may
not
be
necessary
that
they
should
quarrel
.
<EOS>
He
go
out
,
and
roam
by
himself
through
the
ground
,
rather
more
in
meditation
than
be
his
will
not
.
  
<EOS>
if
he
do
marry
,
how
be
he
to
live
?
<EOS>
He
talk
of
a
profession
;
but
have
he
mean
to
do
as
other
do
,
who
make
their
way
in
profession
,
he
should
have
think
of
that
a
year
or
two
ago
!
 
<EOS>
or
,
rather
,
have
do
more
than
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
speak
also
of
a
farm
,
but
even
that
could
not
be
have
in
a
moment
;
nor
,
if
it
could
,
would
it
produce
a
living
.
<EOS>
where
be
his
capital
?
<EOS>
where
his
skill
?
<EOS>
and
he
may
have
ask
also
,
where
the
industry
so
necessary
for
such
a
trade
?
<EOS>
He
may
set
his
father
at
defiance
,
and
if
Mary
be
equally
headstrong
with
himself
,
he
may
marry
her
.
<EOS>
but
,
what
then
?
  
<EOS>
as
he
walk
slowly
about
,
cut
off
the
daisy
with
his
stick
,
he
meet
Mr
Oriel
,
go
up
to
the
house
,
as
be
now
his
custom
,
to
dine
there
and
spend
the
evening
,
close
to
Beatrice
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
I
envy
you
,
Oriel
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
what
would
I
not
give
to
have
such
a
position
in
the
world
as
yours

<EOS>
"
Thou
shalt
not
covet
a

say
Mr
Oriel
;

perhaps
it
ought
to
have
be
add

It
would
not
have
make
much
difference

I

,
do
not
go
for
much
.

<EOS>
"
do
they
not
,
Frank
?
<EOS>
that
be
a
dangerous
doctrine
;
and
one
which
,
if
you
have
my
position
,
you
would
hardly
admit
.
<EOS>
but
what
make
you
so
much
out
of
sort
?
<EOS>
Your
own
position
be
generally
consider
about
the
good
which
the
world
have
to
give
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
?
<EOS>
then
let
me
tell
you
that
the
world
have
very
little
to
give
.
<EOS>
what
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
where
can
I
turn
?
<EOS>
Oriel
,
if
there
be
an
empty
,
lie
humbug
in
the
world
,
it
be
the
theory
of
high
birth
and
pure
blood
which
some
of
us
endeavour
to
maintain
.
<EOS>
blood
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
if
my
father
have
be
a
baker
,
I
should
know
by
this
time
where
to
look
for
my
livelihood
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
I
be
tell
of
nothing
but
my
blood
.
<EOS>
Will
my
blood
ever
get
me
half
a
crown
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
the
young
democrat
walk
on
again
in
solitude
,
leave
Mr
Oriel
in
doubt
as
to
the
exact
line
of
argument
which
he
have
mean
to
inculcate

Greshamsbury

it

have
no
write
credential
,
for
his
master
be
hardly
equal
to
writing
,
and
Lady
Scatcherd
have
decline
to
put
herself
into
further
personal
communication
with
Dr
fillgrave
;
but
he
have
effrontery
enough
to
deliver
any
message
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
Dr
fillgrave
?
"
say
Joe
,
with
one
finger
just
raise
to
his
cocked
hat

<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Dr
Fillgrave
,
with
one
foot
on
the
step
of
the
carriage

pause
at
the
sight
of
so
well
-
turn
-
out
a
servant

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes

I
be
Dr

<EOS>
"

"
then
you

"
Boxall
Hill
!
"
say
the

with
a
very
angry
frown
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
Boxall
Hill
:
my
master

place
 
<EOS>
my
master
be
Sir
Louis
Scatcherd

baronet

<EOS>
You
have
hear
of
him
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dr
Fillgrave
have
not
his
mind
quite
ready
for
such
an
occasion

<EOS>
so
he
withdraw
his
foot
from
the
carriage
step
,
and
rub
his
hand
one
over
another
,
look
at
his
own
hall
door
for
inspiration
.
<EOS>
a
single
glance
at
his
face
be
sufficient
to
show
that
no
ordinary
thought
be
be
turn
over
within
his
breast
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
!
"
say
Joe
,
think
that
his
master
's
name
have
not
altogether
produce
the
magic
effect
which
he
have
expect
;
remember
,
also
,
how
submissive
Greyson
have
always
be
,
who
,
be
a
London
doctor
,
must
be
suppose
to
be
a
big
man
than
this
provincial
fellow

<EOS>
"

do

what

<EOS>
"
what
ail
him

what

<EOS>
"
oh

the

<EOS>
well
,
to
say
it
out
at
once
then
,
he
do
take
a
drop
too
much
at
time
,
and
then
he
have
the
horror
 
<EOS>
what
be
it
<EOS>
they
call
it

<EOS>
delicious

something

<EOS>
"
attend

<EOS>
why

his

that

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes

but
what
medical
attendant
:
what
doctor
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
there
be
Greyson
,
in
London
,
and
 
"
  
"
Greyson
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
doctor
look
as
though
a
name
so
medicinally
humble
have
never
before
strike
the
tympanum
of
his
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
Greyson
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
down
at
what
be
the
name
of
the
place
,
there
be
Thorne
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Greshamsbury
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
but
he
and
Thorne
do
not
hit
it
off
;
and
so
since
that
he
have
have
no
one
but
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
at
Boxall
Hill
in
the
course
of
the
morning
,
"
say
Dr
fillgrave
;
"
or
,
rather
,
you
may
say
,
that
I
will
be
there
at
once
:
I
will
take
it
in
my
way
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
have
thus
resolve
,
he
give
his
order
that
the
post
-
horse
should
make
such
a
detour
as
would
enable
him
to
visit
Boxall
Hill
on
his
road
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
impossible
,
"
say
he
to
himself
,
"
that
I
should
be
twice
treat
in
such
a
manner
in
the
same
house

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
not
,
however
,
altogether
in
a
comfortable
frame
of
mind
as
he
be
drive
up
to
the
hall
door
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
but
remember
the
smile
of
triumph
with
which
his
enemy
have
regard
him
in
that
hall
;
he
could
not
but
think
how
he
have
return
fee
-
less
to
Barchester
,
and
how
little
he
have
gain
in
the
medical
world
by
reject
Lady
Scatcherd
's
bank
-
note
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
also
have
have
his
triumph
since
that
.
<EOS>
He
have
smile
scornfully
at
Dr
Thorne
when
he
have
see
him
in
the
Greshamsbury
street
;
and
have
be
able
to
tell
,
at
twenty
house
through
the
county
,
how
Lady
Arabella
have
at
last
be
oblige
to
place
herself
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
and
he
triumph
again
when
he
find
himself
really
stand
by
Sir
Louis
Scatcherd
's
bedside
.
<EOS>
as
for
Lady
Scatcherd
,
she
do
not
even
show
herself
.
<EOS>
She
keep
in
her
own
little
room
,
send
out
Hannah
to
ask
him
up
the
stair
;
and
she
only
just
get
a
peep
at
him
through
the
door
as
she
hear
the
medical
creak
of
his
shoe
as
he
again
descend
.
  
<EOS>
We
need
say
<EOS>
but
little
of
his
visit
to
Sir
Louis
.
<EOS>
It
matter
nothing
now
,
whether
it
be
Thorne
,
or
Greyson
,
or
Fillgrave
.
<EOS>
and
Dr
Fillgrave
know
that
it
matter
nothing
:
he
have
skill
at
least
for
that
 
and
heart
enough
also
to
feel
that
he
would
fain
have
be
relieve
from
this
task
;
would
fain
have
leave
this
patient
in
the
hand
even
of
Dr
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
the
name
which
Joe
have
give
to
his
master
's
illness
be
certainly
not
a
false
one
.
<EOS>
He
do
find
Sir
Louis
"
in
the
horror
.
<EOS>
"
if
any
father
have
a
son
whose
besetting
sin
be
a
passion
for
alcohol
,
let
him
take
his
child
to
the
room
of
a
drunkard
when
possess
by
"
the
horror
.
<EOS>
"
nothing
will
cure
him
if
not
that
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
disgust
my
reader
by
attempt
to
describe
the
poor
wretch
in
his
misery
:
the
sunken
,
but
yet
glare
eye
;
the
emaciate
cheek
;
the
fall
mouth
;
the
parched
,
sore
lip
;
the
face
,
now
dry
and
hot
,
and
then
suddenly
clammy
with
drop
of
perspiration
;
the
shake
hand
,
and
all
but
palsy
limb
;
and
bad
than
this
,
the
fearful
mental
effort
,
and
the
struggle
for
drink
;
struggle
to
which
it
be
often
necessary
to
give
way
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Fillgrave
soon
know
what
be
to
be
the
man
's
fate
;
but
he
do
what
he
may
to
relieve
it
.
<EOS>
there
,
in
one
big
,
good
bedroom
,
look
out
to
the
north
,
lie
Sir
Louis
Scatcherd
,
die
wretchedly
.
<EOS>
there
,
in
the
other
big
,
good
bedroom
,
look
out
to
the
south
,
have
die
the
other
baronet
about
a
twelvemonth
since
,
and
each
a
victim
to
the
same
sin
.
<EOS>
to
this
have
come
the
prosperity
of
the
house
of
Scatcherd
!
  
<EOS>
and
then
Dr
Fillgrave
go
on
to
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
day
's
work
,
both
for
himself
and
the
horse
;
but
then
,
the
triumph
of
be
drag
up
that
avenue
compensate
for
both
the
expense
and
the
labour
.
<EOS>
He
always
put
on
his
sweetest
smile
as
he
come
near
the
hall
door
,
and
rub
his
hand
in
the
most
complaisant
manner
of
which
he
know
.
<EOS>
It
be
seldom
that
he
see
any
of
the
family
but
Lady
Arabella
;
but
then
he
desire
to
see
none
other
,
and
when
he
leave
her
in
a
good
humour
,
be
quite
content
to
take
his
glass
of
sherry
and
eat
his
lunch
by
himself
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
,
however
,
the
servant
at
once
ask
him
to
go
into
the
dining
-
room
,
and
there
he
find
himself
in
the
presence
of
Frank
Gresham
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
that
Lady
Arabella
,
have
at
last
decide
,
have
send
for
Dr
Thorne
;
and
it
have
become
necessary
that
some
one
should
be
entrust
with
the
duty
of
inform
Dr
Fillgrave
.
<EOS>
that
some
one
must
be
the
squire
,
or
Frank
.
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
would
doubtless
have
prefer
a
messenger
more
absolutely
friendly
to
her
own
side
of
the
house
;
but
such
messenger
there
be
none
:
she
could
not
send
Mr
Gazebee
to
see
her
doctor
,
and
<EOS>
so
,
of
the
two
evil
,
she
choose
the
least
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dr
Fillgrave
,
"
say
Frank
,
shake
hand
with
him
very
cordially
as
he
come
up
,
"
my
mother
be
so
much
oblige
to
you
for
all
your
care
and
anxiety
on
her
behalf
!
<EOS>
and
,
so
indeed
,
be
we
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
shake
hand
with
him
very
warmly
.
<EOS>
this
little
expression
of
a
family
feel
on
his
behalf
be
the
more
gratifying
,
as
he
have
always
think
that
the
male
of
the
Greshamsbury
family
be
still
wed
to
that
pseudo
-
doctor
,
that
half
-
apothecary
who
live
in
the
village
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
have
be
awfully
troublesome
to
you
,
come
over
all
this
way
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
money
could
not
pay
for
it
;
my
mother
feel
that
.
<EOS>
It
must
cut
up
your
time
so
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
,
Mr
Gresham
;
not
at
all
,
"
say
the
Barchester
doctor
,
rise
up
on
his
toe
proudly
as
he
speak
.
<EOS>
"
a
person
of
your
mother
's
importance
,
you
know
!
<EOS>
I
should
be
happy
to
go
any
distance
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
but
,
Dr
Fillgrave
,
we
can
not
allow
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Gresham
,
do
not
mention
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
;
but
I
must
,
"
say
Frank
,
who
think
that
he
have
do
enough
for
civility
,
and
be
now
anxious
to
come
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
"
the
fact
be
,
doctor
,
that
we
be
very
much
oblige
for
what
you
have
do
;
but
,
for
the
future
,
my
mother
think
she
can
trust
to
such
assistance
as
she
can
get
here
in
the
village
.
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
have
be
particularly
instruct
to
be
very
careful
how
he
mention
Dr
Thorne
's
name
,
and
,
therefore
,
cleverly
avoid
it
.
  
<EOS>
get
what
assistance
she
want
in
the
village
!
<EOS>
what
word
be
those
that
he
hear
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Gresham
,
eh
 
hem
 
<EOS>
perhaps
I
do
not
completely
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
alas
!
<EOS>
he
have
completely
understand
what
Frank
have
mean
that
he
should
understand
.
<EOS>
Frank
desire
to
be
civil
,
but
he
have
no
idea
of
beat
unnecessarily
about
the
bush
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
by
Sir
Omicron
's
advice
,
Dr
Fillgrave
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
this
man
here
"
 
and
he
nod
his
head
towards
the
doctor
's
house
,
be
still
anxious
not
to
pronounce
the
hideous
name
 
"
have
know
my
mother
's
constitution
for
so
many
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mr
Gresham
;
of
course
,
if
it
be
wish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Dr
Fillgrave
,
it
be
wish
.
<EOS>
lunch
be
come
directly
:
"
and
Frank
ring
the
bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
,
I
thank
you
,
Mr
Gresham
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
take
a
glass
of
sherry
.
"
  
"
nothing
at
all
,
I
be
very
much
oblige
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
will
not
you
let
the
horse
get
some
oats
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
return
at
once
,
if
you
please
,
Mr
Gresham
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
doctor
do
return
,
take
with
him
,
on
this
occasion
,
the
fee
that
be
offer
to
him
.
<EOS>
His
experience
have
at
any
rate
teach
him
so
much
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
Frank
could
do
this
for
Lady
Arabella
,
he
could
not
receive
Dr
Thorne
on
her
behalf
.
<EOS>
the
bitterness
of
that
interview
have
to
be
bear
by
herself
.
<EOS>
a
messenger
have
be
send
for
him
,
and
he
be
upstairs
with
her
ladyship
while
his
rival
be
receive
his
_
congé
_
downstairs
.
<EOS>
She
have
two
object
to
accomplish
,
if
it
may
be
possible
:
she
have
find
that
high
word
with
the
doctor
be
of
no
avail
;
but
it
may
be
possible
that
Frank
could
be
save
by
humiliation
on
her
part
.
<EOS>
if
she
humble
herself
before
this
man
,
would
he
consent
to
acknowledge
that
his
niece
be
not
the
fit
bride
for
the
heir
of
Greshamsbury
?
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
enter
the
room
where
she
be
lie
on
her
sofa
,
and
walk
up
to
her
with
a
gentle
,
but
yet
not
constrain
step
,
take
the
seat
beside
her
little
table
,
just
as
he
have
always
be
accustomed
to
do
,
and
as
though
there
have
be
no
break
in
their
intercourse
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
doctor
,
you
see
that
I
have
come
back
to
you
,
"
she
say
,
with
a
faint
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
or
,
rather
I
have
come
back
to
you
.
<EOS>
and
,
believe
me
,
Lady
Arabella
,
I
be
very
happy
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
there
need
be
no
excuse
.
<EOS>
You
be
,
doubtless
,
right
to
try
what
other
skill
could
do
;
and
I
hope
it
have
not
be
try
in
vain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
have
mean
to
have
be
so
condescend
;
but
now
all
that
be
put
quite
beyond
her
power
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
easy
to
be
condescend
to
the
doctor
:
she
have
be
try
all
her
life
,
and
have
never
succeed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
have
Sir
Omicron
Pie
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
be
glad
to
hear
.
<EOS>
Sir
Omicron
be
a
clever
man
,
and
have
a
good
name
.
<EOS>
I
always
recommend
Sir
Omicron
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
Sir
Omicron
return
the
compliment
,
"
say
she
,
smile
gracefully
,
"
for
he
recommend
you
.
<EOS>
He
tell
Mr
Gresham
that
I
be
very
foolish
to
quarrel
with
my
good
friend
.
<EOS>
so
now
we
be
friend
again
,
be
we
not
?
<EOS>
You
see
how
selfish
I
be
.
"
<EOS>
and
she
put
out
her
hand
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
take
her
hand
cordially
,
and
assure
her
that
he
bear
her
no
ill
-
will
;
that
he
fully
understand
her
conduct
 
and
that
he
have
never
accuse
her
of
selfishness
.
<EOS>
this
be
all
very
well
and
very
gracious
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
Lady
Arabella
feel
that
the
doctor
keep
the
upper
hand
in
those
sweet
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
whereas
,
she
have
intend
to
keep
the
upper
hand
,
at
least
for
a
while
,
so
that
her
humiliation
may
be
more
effective
when
it
do
come
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
the
doctor
use
his
surgical
lore
,
as
he
well
know
how
to
use
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
assure
confidence
about
him
,
an
air
which
seem
to
declare
that
he
really
know
what
he
be
do
.
<EOS>
these
be
very
comfortable
to
his
patient
,
but
they
be
want
in
Dr
Fillgrave
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
complete
his
examination
and
question
,
and
she
have
complete
her
little
detail
and
make
her
answer
,
she
certainly
be
more
at
ease
than
she
have
be
since
the
doctor
have
last
leave
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
go
yet
for
a
moment
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
one
word
to
say
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
declare
that
he
be
not
the
least
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
He
desire
nothing
better
,
he
say
,
than
to
sit
there
and
talk
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
owe
you
a
most
sincere
apology
,
Lady
Arabella
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
sincere
apology
!
"
<EOS>
say
she
,
become
a
little
red
.
<EOS>
be
he
go
to
say
anything
about
Mary
?
<EOS>
be
he
go
to
own
that
he
,
and
Mary
,
and
Frank
have
all
be
wrong
?
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
ought
not
to
have
bring
Sir
Louis
Scatcherd
here
:
I
ought
to
have
know
that
he
would
have
disgrace
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
it
do
not
signify
,
"
say
her
ladyship
in
a
tone
almost
of
disappointment
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
forget
it
.
<EOS>
Mr
Gresham
and
you
have
more
inconvenience
than
we
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
an
unfortunate
,
wretched
man
 
most
unfortunate
;
with
an
immense
fortune
which
he
can
never
live
to
possess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
who
will
the
money
go
to
,
doctor
?
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
question
for
which
Dr
Thorne
be
hardly
prepared
.
<EOS>
"
go
to
?
"
<EOS>
he
repeat
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
some
member
of
the
family
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
there
be
plenty
of
nephew
and
niece
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
but
will
it
be
divide
,
or
all
go
to
one
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
probably
to
one
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
Sir
Roger
have
a
strong
idea
of
leave
it
all
in
one
hand
.
<EOS>
"
if
it
should
happen
to
be
a
girl
,
think
Lady
Arabella
,
what
an
excellent
opportunity
would
that
be
for
Frank
to
marry
money
!
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
doctor
,
I
want
to
say
one
word
to
you
;
consider
the
very
long
time
that
we
have
know
each
other
,
it
be
well
that
I
should
be
open
with
you
.
<EOS>
this
estrangement
between
us
and
dear
Mary
have
give
us
all
so
much
pain
.
<EOS>
can
not
we
do
anything
to
put
an
end
to
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
what
can
I
say
,
Lady
Arabella
?
<EOS>
that
depend
so
wholly
on
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
it
depend
on
me
,
it
shall
be
do
at
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
bow
.
<EOS>
and
though
he
could
hardly
be
say
to
do
so
stiffly
,
he
do
it
coldly
.
<EOS>
His
bow
seem
to
say
,
"
certainly
;
if
you
choose
to
make
a
proper
_
amende
<EOS>
_
it
can
be
do
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
it
be
very
unlikely
that
you
will
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Beatrice
be
just
go
to
be
marry
,
you
know
that
,
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
doctor
say
that
he
do
know
it
.
"
<EOS>
and
it
will
be
so
pleasant
that
Mary
should
make
one
of
us
.
<EOS>
poor
Beatrice
;
you
do
not
know
what
she
have
suffer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
there
have
be
suffer
,
I
be
sure
;
suffer
on
both
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
wonder
that
we
should
be
so
anxious
about
Frank
,
Dr
Thorne
;
an
only
son
,
and
the
heir
to
an
estate
that
have
be
so
very
long
in
the
family
:
"
and
Lady
Arabella
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eye
,
as
though
these
fact
be
in
themselves
melancholy
,
and
not
to
be
think
of
by
a
mother
without
some
soft
tear
.
<EOS>
"
now
I
wish
you
could
tell
me
what
your
view
be
,
in
a
friendly
manner
,
between
ourselves
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
find
me
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
view
,
Lady
Arabella
?
"
  
"
yes
,
doctor
;
about
your
niece
,
you
know
:
you
must
have
view
of
some
sort
;
that
be
of
course
.
<EOS>
It
occur
to
me
,
that
perhaps
we
be
all
in
the
dark
together
.
<EOS>
if
so
,
a
little
candid
speak
between
you
and
me
may
set
it
all
right
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
's
career
have
not
hitherto
be
conspicuous
for
candour
,
as
far
as
Dr
Thorne
have
be
able
to
judge
of
it
;
but
that
be
no
reason
why
he
should
not
respond
to
so
very
become
an
invitation
on
her
part
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
objection
to
a
little
candid
speaking
;
at
least
,
so
he
declare
.
<EOS>
as
to
his
view
with
regard
to
Mary
,
they
be
merely
these
:
that
he
would
make
her
as
happy
and
comfortable
as
he
could
while
she
remain
with
him
;
and
that
he
would
give
her
his
blessing
 
for
he
have
nothing
else
to
give
her
 
when
she
leave
him
;
 
if
ever
she
should
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
it
will
be
say
that
the
doctor
be
not
very
candid
in
this
;
not
more
so
,
perhaps
,
than
be
Lady
Arabella
herself
.
<EOS>
but
when
one
be
specially
invite
to
be
candid
,
one
be
naturally
set
upon
one
's
guard
.
<EOS>
those
who
by
disposition
be
most
open
,
be
apt
to
become
crafty
when
so
admonished
.
<EOS>
when
a
man
say
to
you
,
"
let
us
be
candid
with
each
other
,
"
you
feel
instinctively
that
he
desire
to
squeeze
you
without
give
a
drop
of
water
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
;
but
about
Frank
,
"
say
Lady
Arabella
.
  
<EOS>
"
about
Frank
!
"
say
the
doctor
,
with
an
innocent
look
,
which
her
ladyship
could
hardly
interpret
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
I
mean
be
this
:
can
you
give
me
your
word
that
these
young
people
do
not
intend
to
do
anything
rash
?
<EOS>
one
word
like
that
from
you
will
set
my
mind
quite
at
rest
.
<EOS>
and
then
we
could
be
so
happy
together
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
ah
!
who
be
to
answer
for
what
rash
thing
a
young
man
will
do
?
"
say
the
doctor
,
smile
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
get
up
from
the
sofa
,
and
push
away
the
little
table
.
<EOS>
the
man
be
false
,
hypocritical
,
and
cunne
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
make
of
him
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
in
a
conspiracy
together
to
rob
her
of
her
son
;
to
make
him
marry
without
money
!
<EOS>
what
should
she
do
?
<EOS>
where
should
she
turn
for
advice
or
counsel
?
<EOS>
She
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
the
doctor
;
and
he
,
perceive
that
this
be
the
case
,
take
his
leave
.
<EOS>
this
little
attempt
to
achieve
candour
have
not
succeed
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
have
answer
Lady
Arabella
as
have
seem
good
to
him
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
;
but
he
be
by
no
mean
satisfied
with
himself
.
<EOS>
as
he
walk
away
through
the
gardens
,
he
bethink
himself
whether
it
would
be
well
for
all
party
if
he
could
bring
himself
to
be
really
candid
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
well
for
him
at
once
to
tell
the
squire
<EOS>
what
be
the
future
prospect
of
his
niece
,
and
let
the
father
agree
to
the
marriage
,
or
not
agree
to
it
,
as
he
may
think
fit
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
if
so
,
if
he
do
do
this
,
would
he
not
in
fact
say
,
"
there
be
my
niece
,
there
be
this
girl
of
whom
you
have
be
talk
for
the
last
twelvemonth
,
<EOS>
indifferent
to
what
agony
of
mind
you
may
have
occasion
to
her
;
there
she
be
,
a
probable
heiress
!
<EOS>
It
may
be
worth
your
son
's
while
to
wait
a
little
time
,
and
not
cast
her
off
till
he
shall
know
whether
she
be
an
heiress
or
no
.
<EOS>
if
it
shall
turn
out
that
she
be
rich
,
let
him
take
her
;
if
not
,
why
,
he
can
desert
her
then
as
well
as
now
.
<EOS>
"
He
could
not
bring
himself
to
put
his
niece
into
such
a
position
as
this
.
<EOS>
He
be
anxious
enough
that
she
should
be
Frank
Gresham
's
wife
,
for
he
love
Frank
Gresham
;
he
be
anxious
enough
,
also
,
that
she
should
give
to
her
husband
the
mean
of
save
the
property
of
his
family
.
<EOS>
but
Frank
,
though
he
may
find
her
rich
,
be
bind
to
take
her
while
she
be
poor
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
also
,
he
doubt
whether
he
would
be
justify
in
speak
of
this
will
at
all
.
<EOS>
He
almost
hate
the
will
for
the
trouble
and
vexation
it
have
give
him
,
and
the
constant
stress
it
have
lay
on
his
conscience
.
<EOS>
He
have
speak
of
it
as
yet
to
no
one
,
and
he
think
that
he
be
resolve
not
to
do
so
while
Sir
Louis
should
yet
be
in
the
land
of
the
living
.
  
<EOS>
on
reach
home
,
he
find
a
note
from
Lady
Scatcherd
,
inform
him
that
Dr
Fillgrave
have
once
more
be
at
Boxall
Hill
,
and
that
,
on
this
occasion
,
he
have
leave
the
house
without
anger
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
he
have
say
about
Louis
,
"
she
add
,
"
for
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
doctor
,
I
be
afraid
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
come
again
to
-
morrow
,
and
then
I
shall
be
braver
.
<EOS>
but
I
fear
that
my
poor
boy
be
in
a
bad
way
.
"
   
<EOS>
Doctor
Thorne
will
not
interfere
 
<EOS>
at
this
period
there
be
,
as
it
be
,
a
truce
to
the
ordinary
little
skirmish
which
have
be
so
customary
between
Lady
Arabella
and
the
squire
.
<EOS>
thing
have
so
fall
out
,
that
they
neither
of
them
have
much
spirit
for
a
contest
;
and
,
moreover
,
on
that
point
which
at
the
present
moment
be
most
think
of
by
both
of
them
,
they
be
strangely
in
unison
.
<EOS>
for
each
of
them
be
anxious
to
prevent
the
threaten
marriage
of
their
only
son
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
,
moreover
,
be
remember
,
that
Lady
Arabella
have
carry
a
great
point
in
oust
Mr
Yates
Umbleby
and
put
the
management
of
the
estate
into
the
hand
of
her
own
partisan
.
<EOS>
but
then
the
squire
have
not
do
less
in
get
rid
of
Fillgrave
and
reinstate
Dr
Thorne
in
possession
of
the
family
invalid
.
<EOS>
the
loss
,
therefore
,
have
be
equal
;
the
victory
equal
;
and
there
be
a
mutual
object
.
  
<EOS>
and
it
must
be
confess
,
also
,
that
Lady
Arabella
's
taste
for
grandeur
be
on
the
decline
.
<EOS>
Misfortune
be
come
too
near
to
her
to
leave
her
much
anxiety
for
the
gaiety
of
a
London
season
.
<EOS>
thing
be
not
fare
well
with
her
.
<EOS>
when
her
eld
daughter
be
go
to
marry
a
man
of
fortune
,
and
a
member
of
Parliament
,
she
have
think
nothing
of
demand
a
thousand
pound
or
so
for
the
extraordinary
expense
incident
to
such
an
occasion
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
Beatrice
be
to
become
the
wife
of
a
parish
parson
,
and
even
that
be
think
to
be
a
fortunate
event
;
she
have
,
therefore
,
no
heart
for
splendour
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
quieter
we
can
do
it
the
well
,
"
she
write
to
her
countess
-
sister
.
"
<EOS>
Her
father
want
to
give
him
at
least
a
thousand
pound
;
but
Mr
Gazebee
have
tell
me
confidentially
that
it
literally
can
not
be
do
at
the
present
moment
!
<EOS>
ah
,
my
dear
Rosina
!
<EOS>
how
thing
have
be
manage
!
<EOS>
if
one
or
two
of
the
girl
will
come
over
,
we
shall
all
take
it
as
a
favour
.
<EOS>
Beatrice
would
think
it
very
kind
of
them
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
think
of
ask
you
or
Amelia
.
<EOS>
"
Amelia
be
always
the
grand
of
the
de
Courcy
family
,
be
almost
on
an
equality
with
 
nay
,
in
some
respect
superior
to
 
the
countess
herself
.
<EOS>
but
this
,
of
course
,
be
before
the
day
of
the
nice
place
in
Surrey
.
  
<EOS>
such
,
and
so
humble
be
the
present
temper
of
the
lady
of
Greshamsbury
,
it
will
not
be
think
surprising
that
she
and
Mr
Gresham
should
at
last
come
together
in
their
effort
to
reclaim
their
son
.
  
<EOS>
at
first
Lady
Arabella
urge
upon
the
squire
the
duty
of
be
very
peremptory
and
very
angry
.
"
<EOS>
do
as
other
father
do
in
such
case
.
<EOS>
make
him
understand
that
he
will
have
no
allowance
to
live
on
.
"
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
understand
that
well
enough
,
"
say
Mr
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
"
threaten
to
cut
him
off
with
a
shilling
,
"
say
her
ladyship
,
with
spirit
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
a
shilling
to
cut
him
off
with
,
"
answer
the
squire
,
bitterly
.
  
<EOS>
but
Lady
Arabella
herself
soon
perceive
,
that
this
line
would
not
do
.
<EOS>
as
Mr
Gresham
himself
confess
,
his
own
sin
against
his
son
have
be
too
great
to
allow
of
his
take
a
high
hand
with
him
.
<EOS>
besides
,
Mr
Gresham
be
not
a
man
who
could
ever
be
severe
with
a
son
whose
individual
conduct
have
be
so
good
as
Frank
's
.
<EOS>
this
marriage
be
,
in
his
view
,
a
misfortune
to
be
avert
if
possible
,
 
to
be
avert
by
any
possible
mean
;
but
,
as
far
as
Frank
be
concern
,
it
be
to
be
regard
rather
as
a
monomania
than
a
crime
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
feel
so
certain
that
he
would
have
succeed
with
Miss
Dunstable
,
"
say
the
mother
,
almost
cry
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
impossible
but
that
at
his
age
a
twelvemonth
's
knock
about
the
world
would
cure
him
,
"
say
the
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
hear
of
a
boy
be
so
obstinate
about
a
girl
,
"
say
the
mother
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
he
do
not
get
it
from
the
de
Courcys
:
"
and
then
,
again
,
they
talk
it
over
in
all
its
bearing
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
be
they
to
live
upon
?
"
say
Lady
Arabella
,
appeal
,
as
it

to
some
impersonation
of
reason

what
I

him
to

what
be
they
to
live
upon

<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
de
Courcy
could
get
him
into
some
embassy
?
"
say
the
father
.
<EOS>
"
He
do
talk
of
a
profession
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
with
the
girl
and
all
?
"
ask
Lady
Arabella
with
horror
,
alarm
at
the
idea
of
such
an
appeal
be
make
to
her
noble
brother

<EOS>
"
no
;
but
before
he
marry
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
break
of
it
that
way

<EOS>
"
  
"
nothing
will
break
him
,
"
say
the
wretched
mother

nothing
 
nothing

for
my

I

here

oh

<EOS>
oh

dear

<EOS>
why

she

<EOS>
this
last
question
Mr
Gresham
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
answer

<EOS>
that
evil
have
be
do

it
would
be
useless
to
dispute
it

<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
I

do

"

he
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
speak
to
the

"
It

not
the
slight
use

"
say
Lady
Arabella

<EOS>
"
He
will
not

us

<EOS>
indeed

I
firmly
believe
it
be
all
his

doing

<EOS>
"
oh
,
nonsense
!
<EOS>
that
really
be
nonsense

my

"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
very
well
,
Mr
Gresham
.
<EOS>
what
I
say
be
always
nonsense
,
I
know
;
you
have
always
tell
me
so
.
<EOS>
but
yet
,
see
how
thing
have
turn
out
.
<EOS>
I
know
how
it
would
be
when
she
be
first
bring
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
assertion
be
rather
a
stretch
on
the
part
of
Lady
Arabella
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
it
be
nonsense
to
say
that
Frank
be
in
love
with
the
girl
at
the
doctor
's
bidding
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
know
,
Mr
Gresham
,
that
I
do
not
mean
that

what
I
say
be
this
,
that
Dr
Thorne
,
find
what
an
easy
fool
Frank
be

"
I
do
not

he
be
at
all
easy

my

certainly
be
not

fool

<EOS>
"
  
"
very
well
,
have
it
your
own
way
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
a
word
more
.
<EOS>
I
be
struggle
to
do
my
good
,

I
be
browbeat
on
every
side
.
<EOS>
God
know
I
be
not
in
a
state
of
health
to
bear
it
!
"
<EOS>
and
Lady
Arabella
bow
her
head
into
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
my
dear
,
if
you
be
to
see
Mary
herself
it
may
do
some
good
,
"
say
the
squire
,
when
the
violence
of
his
wife
's
grief
have
somewhat
subside
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
go
and
call
upon
this
girl
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
;
you
can
send
Beatrice
to
give
her
notice
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
She
never
be
unreasonable
,
and
I
do
not
think
that
you
would
find
her
so
.
<EOS>
You
should
tell
her
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
oh
,
I
should
know
very
well
what
to
tell
her
,
Mr
Gresham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
my
love
;
I
be
sure
you
would
;
nobody
better
.
<EOS>
but
what
I
mean
be
,
that
if
you
be
to
do
any
good
,
you
should
be
kind
in
your
manner
.
<EOS>
Mary
Thorne
have
a
spirit
that
you
can
not
break
.
<EOS>
You
may
perhaps
lead
,
but
nobody
can
drive
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
this
scheme
originate
with
her
husband
,
Lady
Arabella
could
not
,
of
course
,
confes
that
there
be
much
in
it
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
she
determine
to
attempt
it
,
think
that
if
anything
could
be
efficacious
for
good
in
their
present
misfortune
,
it
would
be
her
own
diplomatic
power
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
therefore
,
at
last
settle
between
them
,
that
he
should
endeavour
to
talk
over
the
doctor
,
and
that
she
would
do
the
same
with
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
then
I
will
speak
to
Frank
,
"
say
Lady
Arabella
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
yet
he
have
never
have
the
audacity
to
open
his
mouth
to
me
about
Mary
Thorne
,
though
I
believe
he
declare
his
love
openly
to
every
one
else
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
will
get
Oriel
to
speak
to
him
,
"
say
the
squire
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
Patience
may
do
more
good
.
<EOS>
I
do
once
think
he
be
get
fond
of
Patience
,
and
I
be
quite
unhappy
about
it
then
.
<EOS>
ah
,
dear
!
<EOS>
I
should
be
almost
pleased
at
that
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
thus
it
be
arrange
that
all
the
artillery
of
Greshamsbury
be
to
be
bring
to
bear
at
once
on
Frank
's
love
,
so
as
to
crush
it
,
as
it
be
,
by
the
very
weight
of
metal
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
imagine
that
the
squire
would
have
less
scruple
in
address
the
doctor
on
this
matter
than
his
wife
would
feel
;
and
that
his
part
of
their
present
joint
undertaking
be
less
difficult
than
her
.
<EOS>
for
he
and
the
doctor
have
ever
be
friend
at
heart
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
do
feel
much
scruple
,
as
,
with
his
stick
in
hand
,
he
walk
down
to
the
little
gate
which
open
out
near
the
doctor
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
this
feeling
be
so
strong
,
that
he
walk
on
beyond
this
door
to
the
entrance
,
think
of
what
he
be
go
to
do
,
and
then
back
again
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
be
his
fate
to
be
depend
always
on
the
clemency
or
consideration
of
Dr
Thorne
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
the
doctor
be
impose
the
only
obstacle
which
be
offer
to
the
sale
of
a
great
part
of
his
estate
.
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
,
through
his
lawyer
,
be
press
the
doctor
to
sell
,
and
the
lawyer
be
loudly
accuse
the
doctor
of
delay
to
do
so
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
the
management
of
your
property
,
"
say
Mr
Finnie
;
"
but
he
manage
it
in
the
interest
of
his
own
friend
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
clear
,
and
we
will
expose
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
by
all
mean
,
"
say
Sir
Louis
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
d
 
---
d
shame
,
and
it
shall
be
expose
.
<EOS>
"
of
all
this
the
squire
be
aware
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
reach
the
doctor
's
house
,
he
be
show
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
find
Mary
there
alone
.
<EOS>
It
have
always
be
his
habit
to
kiss
her
forehead
when
he
chance
to
meet
her
about
the
house
at
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
young
and
more
childish
then
;
but
even
now
she
be
but
a
child
to
him
,
so
he
kiss
her
as
he
have
be
will
not
to
do
.
<EOS>
She
blush
slightly
as
she
look
up
into
his
face
,
and
say
:
"
oh
,
Mr
Gresham
,
I
be
so
glad
to
see
you
here
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
he
look
at
her
he
could
not
but
acknowledge
that
it
be
natural
that
Frank
should
love
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
before
see
that
she
be
attractive
;
 
have
never
have
an
opinion
about
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
grow
up
as
a
child
under
his
eye
;
and
as
she
have
not
have
the
name
of
be
especially
a
pretty
child
,
he
have
never
think
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
now
he
see
before
him
a
woman
whose
every
feature
be
full
of
spirit
and
animation
;
whose
eye
sparkle
with
more
than
mere
brilliancy
;
whose
face
be
full
of
intelligence
;
whose
very
smile
be
eloquent
.
<EOS>
be
it
to
be
wonder
at
that
Frank
should
have
learn
to
love
her
?
  
<EOS>
Miss
Thorne
want
but
one
attribute
which
many
consider
essential
to
feminine
beauty
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
brilliancy
of
complexion
,
no
pearly
whiteness
,
no
vivid
carnation
;
nor
,
indeed
,
do
she
possess
the
dark
brilliance
of
a
brunette
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
speak
earnestness
in
her
face
;
an
expression
of
mental
faculty
which
the
squire
now
for
the
first
time
perceive
to
be
charming
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
he
know
how
good
she
be
.
<EOS>
He
know
well
what
be
her
nature
;
how
generous
,
how
open
,
how
affectionate
,
and
yet
how
proud
!
<EOS>
Her
pride
be
her
fault
;
but
even
that
be
not
a
fault
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
out
of
his
own
family
there
be
no
one
whom
he
have
love
,
and
could
love
,
as
he
love
her
.
<EOS>
He
feel
,
and
acknowledge
that
no
man
could
have
a
well
wife
.
<EOS>
and
yet
he
be
there
with
the
express
object
of
rescue
his
son
from
such
a
marriage
!
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
look
very
well
,
Mary
,
"
he
say
,
almost
involuntarily
.
"
<EOS>
be
I
?
"
<EOS>
she
answer
,
smile
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
nice
at
any
rate
to
be
compliment
.
<EOS>
Uncle
never
pay
me
any
compliment
of
that
sort
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
truth
,
she
be
look
well
.
<EOS>
She
would
say
to
herself
over
and
over
again
,
from
morning
to
night
,
that
Frank
's
love
for
her
would
be
,
must
be
,
unfortunate
;
could
not
lead
to
happiness
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
it
do
make
her
happy
.
<EOS>
She
have
before
his
return
make
up
her
mind
to
be
forget
,
and
it
be
so
sweet
to
find
that
he
have
be
so
far
from
forget
her
.
<EOS>
a
girl
may
scold
a
man
in
word
for
rashness
in
his
love
,
but
her
heart
never
scold
him
for
such
an
offence
as
that
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
be
slight
,
and
her
heart
,
therefore
,
still
rise
buoyant
within
her
breast
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
as
the
squire
's
visit
have
be
expect
by
him
,
he
have
of
course
not
be
out
of
the
house
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
I
suppose
I
must
go
,
"
say
Mary
;
"
for
I
know
you
be
go
to
talk
about
business
.
<EOS>
but
,
uncle
,
Mr
Gresham
say
I
be
look
very
well
.
<EOS>
why
have
you
not
be
able
to
find
that
out
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
a
dear
,
good
girl
,
"
say
the
squire
,
as
the
door
shut
behind
her
;
"
a
dear
good
girl
;
"
and
the
doctor
could
not
fail
to
see
that
his
eye
be
fill
with
tear
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
be
,
"
say
he
,
quietly
.
<EOS>
and
then
they
both
sit
silent
,
as
though
each
be
wait
to
hear
whether
the
other
have
anything
more
to
say
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
at
any
rate
,
have
nothing
more
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
here
specially
to
speak
to
you
about
her
,
"
say
the
squire
.
  
<EOS>
"
about
Mary
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
doctor
;
about
her
and
Frank
:
something
must
be
do
,
some
arrangement
make
:
if
not
for
our
sake
,
at
least
for
theirs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
arrangement
,
squire
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
that
be
the
question
.
<EOS>
I
take
it
for
grant
that
either
Frank
or
Mary
have
tell
you
that
they
have
engage
themselves
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Frank
tell
me
so
twelve
month
since
.
"
  
"
and
have
not
Mary
tell
you
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
exactly
that
.
<EOS>
but
,
never
mind
<EOS>
;
she
have
,
I
believe
,
no
secret
from
me
.
<EOS>
though
I
have
say
<EOS>
but
little
to
her
,
I
think
I
know
it
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
what
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
shake
his
head
and
put
up
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
have
nothing
to
say
;
no
proposition
to
make
;
no
arrangement
to
suggest
.
<EOS>
the
thing
be
so
,
and
he
seem
to
say
that
,
as
far
as
he
be
concern
,
there
be
an
end
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
squire
sit
look
at
him
,
hardly
know
how
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
him
,
that
the
fact
of
a
young
man
and
a
young
lady
be
in
love
with
each
other
be
not
a
thing
to
be
leave
to
arrange
itself
,
particularly
,
see
the
rank
of
life
in
which
they
be
place
.
<EOS>
but
the
doctor
seem
to
be
of
a
different
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Dr
Thorne
,
there
be
no
man
on
God
's
earth
who
know
my
affair
as
well
as
you
do
;
and
in
know
mine
,
you
know
Frank
's
.
<EOS>
do
you
think
it
possible
that
they
should
marry
each
other
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
possible
;
yes
,
it
be
possible
.
<EOS>
You
mean
,
will
it
be
prudent
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
take
it
in
that
way
;
would
it
not
be
most
imprudent
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
at
present
,
it
certainly
would
be
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
speak
to
either
of
them
on
the
subject
;
but
I
presume
they
do
not
think
of
such
a
thing
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
doctor
 
<EOS>
"
the
squire
be
certainly
take
aback
by
the
coolness
of
the
doctor
's
manner
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
he
,
the
squire
,
be
Mr
Gresham
of
Greshamsbury
,
generally
acknowledge
to
be
the
first
commoner
in
Barsetshire
;
after
all
,
Frank
be
his
heir
,
and
,
in
process
of
time
,
he
would
be
Mr
Gresham
of
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
cripple
as
the
estate
be
,
there
would
be
something
leave
,
and
the
rank
at
any
rate
remain
.
<EOS>
but
as
to
Mary
,
she
be
not
even
the
doctor
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
only
penniless
,
but
nameless
,
fatherless
,
bad
than
motherless
!
<EOS>
It
be
incredible
that
Dr
Thorne
,
with
his
generally
exalt
idea
as
to
family
,
should
speak
in
this
cold
way
as
to
a
project
marriage
between
the
heir
of
Greshamsbury
and
his
brother
's
bastard
child
!
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
doctor
,
"
repeat
the
squire
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
put
one
leg
over
the
other
,
and
begin
to
rub
his
calf
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Squire
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
know
all
that
you
would
say
,
all
that
you
mean
.
<EOS>
and
you
do
not
like
to
say
it
,
because
you
would
not
wish
to
pain
me
by
allude
to
Mary
's
birth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
independently
of
that
,
what
would
they
live
on
?
"
say
the
squire
,
energetically
.
<EOS>
"
birth
be
a
great
thing
,
a
very
great
thing
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
think
exactly
alike
about
that
,
so
we
need
have
no
dispute
.
<EOS>
You
be
quite
as
proud
of
Ullathorne
as
I
be
of
Greshamsbury

<EOS>
"
I
may
be
if
it
belong
to
me

but
you
be
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
use
arguing
.
<EOS>
but
,
put
that
aside
altogether
,
what
would
they
live
on
?
<EOS>
if
they
be
to
marry
,
what
would
they
do
?
<EOS>
where
would
they
go
?
<EOS>
You
know
what
Lady
Arabella
think
of
such
thing
;
would
it
be
possible
that
they
should
live
up
at
the
house
with
her
?
<EOS>
besides
,
what
a
life
would
that
be
for
both
of
them
!
<EOS>
Could
they
live
here
?
<EOS>
Would
that
be
well
for
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
squire
look
at
the
doctor
for
an
answer
;
but
he
still
go
on
rub
his
calf
.
<EOS>
Mr
Gresham
,
therefore
,
be
constrain
to
continue
his
expostulation
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
I
be
dead
there
will
still
,
I
hope
,
be
something
;
 
something
leave
for
the
poor
fellow

<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
and
the
girl
would
be
well
off
,
perhaps
,
than
now
,
and
I
sometimes
wish
,
for
Frank
's
sake
,
that
the
time
have
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
could
not
now
go
on
rub
his
leg
.
<EOS>
He
be
move
to
speak
,
and
declare
that
,
of
all
event
,
that
be
the
one
which
would
be
furth
from
Frank
's
heart
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
no
son
,
"
say
he
,
"
who
love
his
father
more
dearly
than
he
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
believe
it
,
"
say
the
squire
;
"
I
do
believe
it
.
<EOS>

yet
,
I
can
not
but
feel
that
I
be
in
his
way

<EOS>
"
no
,
squire
,
no
<EOS>
;
you
be
in
no
one

way

You
will
find
yourself
happy
with
your
son
yet
,
and
proud
of
him

and
proud
of
his
wife

too

<EOS>
I
hope
so
,
and
I
think
so
:
I
do
,
indeed
,
or
<EOS>
I
should
not
say
so
,
squire
;
we
will
have
many
a
happy
day
yet
together
,
when
we
shall
talk
of
all
these
thing
over
the
dining
-
room
fire
at
Greshamsbury
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
squire
feel
it
kind
in
the
doctor
that
he
should
thus
endeavour
to
comfort
him
;
but
he
could
not
understand
,
and
do
not
inquire
,
on
what
basis
these
golden
hope
be
found
.
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
,
however
,
to
return
to
the
subject
which
he
have
come
to
discuss
.
<EOS>
Would
the
doctor
assist
him
in
prevent
this
marriage
?
<EOS>
that
be
now
the
one
thing
necessary
to
be
keep
in
view
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
doctor
,
about
the
young
people
;
of
course
they
can
not
marry
,
you
be
aware
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
exactly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
doctor
,
I
must
say
I
think
you
would
feel
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
feel
what
,
squire
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
,
situate
as
they
be
,
they
ought
not
to
marry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
quite
another
question
.
<EOS>
I
have
say
nothing
about
that
either
to
you
or
to
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
squire
,
I
have
never
interfere
in
this
matter
one
way
or
the
other
;
and
I
have
no
wish
to
do
so
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
should
you
not
interfere
?
<EOS>
be
not
Mary
the
same
to
you
as
your
own
child
?
"
  
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
hardly
know
how
to
answer
this
.
<EOS>
He
be
aware
that
his
argument
about
not
interfere
be
in
fact
absurd
.
<EOS>
Mary
could
not
marry
without
his
interference
;
and
have
it
be
the
case
that
she
be
in
danger
of
make
an
improper
marriage
,
of
course
he
would
interfere
.
<EOS>
His
meaning
be
,
that
he
would
not
at
the
present
moment
express
any
opinion
;
he
would
not
declare
against
a
match
which
may
turn
out
to
be
in
every
way
desirable
;
nor
,
if
he
speak
in
favour
of
it
,
could
he
give
his
reason
for
do
so
.
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
,
he
would
have
wish
to
say
nothing
,
could
that
only
have
be
possible
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
it
be
not
possible
,
and
as
he
must
say
something
,
he
answer
the
squire
's
last
question
by
ask
another
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
your
objection
,
squire
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
objection
!
<EOS>
why
,
what
on
earth
would
they
live
on
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
understand
,
that
if
that
difficulty
be
over
,
you
would
not
refuse
your
consent
merely
because
of
Mary
's
birth
?
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
manner
in
which
the
squire
have
by
no
mean
expect
to
have
the
affair
present
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
seem
so
impossible
that
any
sound
-
minded
man
should
take
any
<EOS>
but
his
view
of
the
case
,
that
he
have
not
prepare
himself
for
argument
.
<EOS>
there
be
every
objection
to
his
son
marry
Miss
Thorne
;
but
the
fact
of
their
have
no
income
between
them
,
do
certainly
justify
him
in
allege
that
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
that
difficulty
can
not
be
get
over
,
doctor
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
however
,
that
it
would
be
cause
of
grief
to
us
all
to
see
Frank
marry
much
beneath
his
station
;
that
is
,
I
mean
,
in
family
.
<EOS>
You
should
not
press
me
to
say
this
,
for
you
know
that
I
love
Mary
dearly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
my
dear
friend
,
it
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
wound
sometimes
must
be
open
in
order
that
they
may
be
heal
.
<EOS>
what
I
mean
be
this
;
 
and
,
squire
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
I
need
not
say
to
you
that
I
hope
for
an
honest
answer
,
 
be
Mary
Thorne
an
heiress
;
have
she
,
for
instance
,
<EOS>
such
wealth
as
that
Miss
Dunstable
that
we
hear
of
<EOS>
;
in
that
case
would
you
object
to
the
match
?
"
  
<EOS>
when
the
doctor
declare
that
he
expect
an
honest
answer
the
squire
listen
with
all
his
ear
;
but
the
question
,
when
finish
,
seem
to
have
no
bearing
on
the
present
case
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
squire
,
speak
your
mind
faithfully
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
talk
once
of
Frank
's
marry
Miss
Dunstable
;
do
you
mean
to
object
to
that
match
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Miss
Dunstable
be
legitimate
;
at
least
,
I
presume
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mr
Gresham
!
<EOS>
have
it
come
to
that
?
<EOS>
Miss
Dunstable
,
then
,
would
have
satisfy
your
idea
of
high
birth
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Gresham
be
rather
pose
,
and
regret
,
at
the
moment
,
his
allusion
to
Miss
Dunstable
's
presume
legitimacy
.
<EOS>
but
he
soon
recover
himself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
"
say
he
,
"
it
would
not
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
willing
to
admit
,
as
I
have
admit
before
,
that
the
undoubted
advantage
arise
from
wealth
be
take
by
the
world
as
atone
for
what
otherwise
would
be
a
_
mésalliance
_
.
<EOS>
but
 
"
  
"
You
admit
that
,
do
you
?
<EOS>
You
acknowledge
that
as
your
conviction
on
the
subject
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
but
 
"
the
squire
be
go
on
to
explain
the
propriety
of
this
opinion
,
but
the
doctor
uncivilly
would
not
hear
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
squire
,
I
will
not
interfere
in
this
matter
one
way

the
other

"
how
on
earth
can
such
an
opinion
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
pray
excuse
me
,
Mr
Gresham
;
but
my
mind
be
now
quite
make
up

<EOS>
It
be
very
nearly
so
before
.
<EOS>
I
will
do
nothing
to
encourage
Frank
,
nor
will
I
say
anything
to
discourage
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
most
singular
resolution
that
a
man
of
sense
like
you
ever
come
to
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
I
can
not
help
it
,
squire
;
it
be
my
resolution
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
have
Miss
Dunstable
's
fortune
to
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
that
it
have
anything
;
but
,
in
this
matter
,
I
will
not
interfere

"
  
<EOS>
the
squire
go
on
for
some
time
,
but
it
be
all
to
no
purpose
;
and
at
last
he
leave
the
house
,
considerably
in
dudgeon
.
<EOS>
the
only
conclusion
to
which
he
could
come
be
,
that
Dr
Thorne
have
think
the
chance
on
his
niece
's
behalf
too
good
to
be
throw
away
,
and
have
,
therefore
,
resolve
to
act
in
this
very
singular
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
have
believe
it
of
him
,
though
all
Barsetshire
have
tell
me
,
"
he
say
to
himself
as
he
enter
the
great
gate
;
and
he
go
on
repeat
the
same
word
till
he
find
himself
in
his
own
room
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
not
if
all
Barsetshire
have
tell
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
,
however
,
communicate
the
ill
result
of
his
visit
to
the
Lady
Arabella
.
   
<EOS>
what
Can
You
give
in
Return
?
 
<EOS>
in
spite
of
the
family
trouble
,
these
be
happy
day
for
Beatrice
.
<EOS>
It
so
seldom
happen
that
young
lady
on
the
eve
of
their
marriage
have
their
future
husband
live
near
them
.
<EOS>
this
happiness
be
her
,
and
Mr
Oriel
make
the
most
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
constantly
be
coax
down
to
the
parsonage
by
Patience
,
in
order
that
she
may
give
her
opinion
,
in
private
,
as
to
some
domestic
arrangement
,
some
piece
of
furniture
,
or
some
new
carpet
;
but
this
privacy
be
always
invade
.
<EOS>
what
Mr
Oriel
's
parishioner
do
in
these
halcyon
day
,
I
will
not
ask
.
<EOS>
His
morning
service
,
however
,
have
be
altogether
give
up
,
and
he
have
provide
himself
with
a
very
excellent
curate
.
  
<EOS>
but
one
grief
do
weigh
heavily
on
Beatrice
.
<EOS>
She
continually
hear
her
mother
say
thing
which
make
her
feel
that
it
would
be
more
than
ever
impossible
that
Mary
should
be
at
her
wedding
;
and
yet
she
have
promise
her
brother
to
ask
her
.
<EOS>
Frank
have
also
repeat
his
threat
,
that
if
Mary
be
not
present
,
he
would
absent
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Beatrice
do
what
most
girl
do
in
such
a
case
;
what
all
would
do
who
be
worth
anything
;
she
ask
her
lover
's
advice
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
but
Frank
can
not
be
in
earnest
,
"
say
the
lover
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
he
will
be
at
our
wedding
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
know
him
,
Caleb
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
changed
that
no
one
hardly
would
know
him
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
conceive
how
much
in
earnest
<EOS>
he
be
,
how
determined
and
resolute
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
I
should
like
to
have
Mary
so
much
if
mamma
would
let
her
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ask
Lady
Arabella
,
"
say
Caleb
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
suppose
I
must
do
that
;
but
I
know
what
she
will
say
,
and
Frank
will
never
believe
that
I
have
do
my
good
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Oriel
comfort
her
with
such
little
whispered
consolation
as
he
be
able
to
afford
,
and
then
she
go
away
on
her
errand
to
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
indeed
surprised
at
the
manner
in
which
her
prayer
be
receive
.
<EOS>
She
could
hardly
falter
forth
her
petition
;
but
when
she
have
do
so
,
Lady
Arabella
answer
in
this
wise
:
    
"
well
my
dear
,
I
have
no
objection
,
none
the
least
;
that
is
,
of
course
,
if
Mary
be
dispose
to
behave
herself
properly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
mamma
!
<EOS>
of
course
she
will
,
"
say
Beatrice
;
"
she
always
do
and
always
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
will
,
my
love
.
<EOS>
but
,
Beatrice
,
when
I
say
that
I
shall
be
glad
to
see
her
,
of
course
I
mean
under
certain
condition
.
<EOS>
I
never
dislike
Mary
Thorne
,
and
if
she
would
only
let
Frank
understand
that
she
will
not
listen
to
his
mad
proposal
,
I
should
be
delighted
to
see
her
at
Greshamsbury
just
as
she
use
to
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
Beatrice
could
say
nothing
in
answer
to
this
;
but
she
feel
very
sure
that
Mary
,
let
her
intention
be
what
it
may
,
would
not
undertake
to
make
Frank
understand
anything
at
anybody
's
bidding
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
I
will
do
,
my
dear
,
"
continue
Lady
Arabella
;
"
I
will
call
on
Mary
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
at
Dr
Thorne
's
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
why
not
?
<EOS>
I
have
be
at
Dr
Thorne
's
house
before
now
.
"
<EOS>
and
Lady
Arabella
could
not
but
think
of
her
last
visit
thither
,
and
the
strong
feeling
she
have
,
as
she
come
out
,
that
she
would
never
again
enter
those
door
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
however
,
prepare
to
do
anything
on
behalf
of
her
rebellious
son
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
!
<EOS>
I
know
that
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
call
upon
her
,
and
if
I
can
possibly
manage
it
,
I
will
ask
her
myself
to
make
one
of
your
party
.
<EOS>
if
so
,
you
can
go
to
her
afterwards
and
make
your
own
arrangement
.
<EOS>
just
write
her
a
note
,
my
dear
,
and
say
that
I
will
call
to
-
morrow
at
twelve
.
<EOS>
It
may
fluster
her
if
I
be
to
go
in
without
notice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Beatrice
do
as
she
be
bid
,
but
with
a
presentiment
that
no
good
would
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
note
be
certainly
unnecessary
for
the
purpose
assign
by
Lady
Arabella
,
as
Mary
be
not
give
to
be
fluster
by
such
occurrence
;
but
,
perhaps
,
it
be
as
well
that
it
be
write
,
as
it
enable
her
to
make
up
her
mind
steadily
as
to
what
information
should
be
give
,
and
what
should
not
be
give
to
her
come
visitor
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
next
morning
,
at
the
appoint
hour
,
Lady
Arabella
walk
down
to
the
doctor
's
house
.
<EOS>
She
never
walk
about
the
village
without
make
some
little
disturbance
among
the
inhabitant
.
<EOS>
with
the
squire
,
himself
,
they
be
quite
familiar
,
and
he
could
appear
and
reappear
without
create
any
sensation
;
but
her
ladyship
have
not
make
herself
equally
common
in
man
's
sight
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
when
she
go
in
at
the
doctor
's
little
gate
,
the
fact
be
know
through
all
Greshamsbury
in
ten
minute
,
and
before
she
have
leave
the
house
,
Mrs
Umbleby
and
Miss
Gushing
have
quite
settle
between
them
<EOS>
what
be
the
exact
cause
of
the
very
singular
event
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
when
he
have
hear
what
be
go
to
happen
,
carefully
keep
out
of
the
way
:
Mary
,
therefore
,
have
the
pleasure
of
receive
Lady
Arabella
alone
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
exceed
her
ladyship
's
affability
.
<EOS>
Mary
think
that
it
perhaps
may
have
savour
less
of
condescension
;
but
then
,
on
this
subject
,
Mary
be
probably
prejudice
.
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
smile
and
simper
,
and
ask
after
the
doctor
,
and
the
cat
,
and
Janet
,
and
say
everything
that
could
have
be
desire
by
any
one
less
unreasonable
than
Mary
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
Mary
,
I
will
tell
you
why
I
have
call
.
"
<EOS>
Mary
bow
her
head
slightly
,
as
much
to
say
,
that
she
would
be
glad
to
receive
any
information
that
Lady
Arabella
could
give
her
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
know
that
Beatrice
be
go
to
be
marry
very
shortly
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
acknowledge
that
she
have
hear
so
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
:
we
think
it
will
be
in
September
 
early
in
September
 
and
that
be
come
very
soon
now
.
<EOS>
the
poor
girl
be
anxious
that
you
should
be
at
her
wedding
.
"
<EOS>
Mary
turn
slightly
red
;
but
she
merely
say
,
and
that
somewhat
too
coldly
,
that
she
be
much
indebted
to
Beatrice
for
her
kindness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
assure
you
,
Mary
,
that
she
be
very
fond
of
you
,
as
much
so
as
ever
;
and
so
,
indeed
,
be
I
,
and
all
of
us
be
so
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
Mr
Gresham
be
always
your
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
he
always
be
,
and
I
be
grateful
to
Mr
Gresham
,
"
answer
Mary
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
for
Lady
Arabella
that
she
have
her
temper
under
command
,
for
have
she
speak
her
mind
<EOS>
out
there
would
have
be
very
little
chance
leave
for
reconciliation
between
her
and
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
indeed
he
be
;
and
I
think
we
all
do
what
little
we
could
to
make
you
welcome
at
Greshamsbury
,
Mary
,
till
those
unpleasant
occurrence
take
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
occurrence
,
Lady
Arabella
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
Beatrice
be
so
very
anxious
on
this
point
,
"
say
her
ladyship
,
ignore
for
the
moment
Mary
's
question
.
<EOS>
"
You
two
have
be
so
much
together
,
that
she
feel
she
can
not
be
quite
happy
if
you
be
not
near
her
when
she
be
be
marry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
dear
Beatrice
!
<EOS>
"
say
Mary
,
warm
for
the
moment
to
an
expression
of
genuine
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
come
to
me
yesterday
,
beg
that
I
would
waive
any
objection
I
may
have
to
your
be
there
.
<EOS>
I
have
make
her
no
answer
yet
.
<EOS>
what
answer
<EOS>
do
you
think
I
ought
to
make
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
be
astounded
at
this
question
,
and
hesitate
in
her
reply
.
<EOS>
"
what
answer
ought
you
to
make
her
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
what
answer
<EOS>
do
you
think
I
ought
to
give
?
<EOS>
I
wish
to
ask
you
the
question
,
as
you
be
the
person
the
most
concerned
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
consider
for
a
while
,
and
then
do
give
her
opinion
on
the
matter
in
a
firm
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
should
tell
Beatrice
,
that
as
you
can
not
at
present
receive
me
cordially
in
your
house
,
it
will
be
well
that
you
should
not
be
call
on
to
receive
me
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
certainly
not
the
sort
of
answer
that
Lady
Arabella
expect
,
and
she
be
now
somewhat
astounded
in
her
turn
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
,
Mary
,
"
she
say
,
"
I
should
be
delighted
to
receive
you
cordially
if
I
could
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
seem
you
can
not
,
Lady
Arabella
;
and
so
there
must
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
but
I
do
not
know
that
:
"
and
she
smile
her
sweetest
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
put
an
end
to
all
this
ill
-
feeling
if
I
can
.
<EOS>
It
all
depend
upon
one
thing
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
it
,
Lady
Arabella
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
upon
one
thing
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
be
angry
if
I
ask
you
another
question
 
eh
,
Mary
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
at
least
I
do
not
think
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
any
truth
in
what
we
hear
about
your
be
engage
to
Frank
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
make
no
immediate
answer
to
this
,
but
sit
quite
silent
,
look
Lady
Arabella
in
the
face
;
not
but
that
she
have
make
up
her
mind
as
to
what
answer
she
would
give
,
but
the
exact
word
fail
her
at
the
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
must
have
hear
of
such
a
rumour
,
"
continue
Lady
Arabella
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
I
have
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
and
you
have
notice
it
,
and
I
must
say
very
properly
.
<EOS>
when
you
go
to
Boxall
Hill
,
and
before
that
with
Miss
Oriel
's
to
her
aunt
's
,
I
think
you
behave
extremely
well
.
"
<EOS>
Mary
feel
herself
glow
with
indignation
,
and
begin
to
prepare
word
that
should
be
sharp
and
decisive
.
"
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
people
talk
;
and
Frank
,
who
be
still
quite
a
boy
"
<EOS>
(
Mary
's
indignation
be
not
soften
by
this
allusion
to
Frank
's
folly
)
,
"
seem
to
have
get
some
nonsense
in
his
head
.
<EOS>
I
grieve
to
say
it
,
but
I
feel
myself
in
justice
bind
to
do
so
,
that
in
this
matter
he
have
not
act
as
well
as
you
have
do
.
<EOS>
now
,
therefore
,
I
merely
ask
you
whether
there
be
any
truth
in
the
report
.
<EOS>
if
you
tell
me
that
there
be
none
,
I
shall
be
quite
contented
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
altogether
true
,
Lady
Arabella
;
I
be
engage
to
Frank
Gresham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
engage
to
be
married
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
;
engage
to
be
married
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
what
be
to
say
or
do
now
?
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
plain
,
more
decided
,
or
less
embarrassed
with
doubt
than
Mary
's
declaration
.
<EOS>
and
as
she
make
it
she
look
her
visitor
full
in
the
face
,
blush
indeed
,
for
her
cheek
be
now
suffuse
as
well
as
her
forehead
;
but
boldly
,
and
,
as
it
be
,
with
defiance
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
tell
me
so
to
my
face
,
Miss
Thorne
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
why
not
?
<EOS>
do
you
not
ask
me
the
question
;
and
would
you
have
me
answer
you
with
a
falsehood
?
<EOS>
I
be
engage
to
him
.
<EOS>
as
you
would
put
the
question
to
me
,
what
other
answer
could
I
make
?
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
that
I
be
engage
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
decisive
abruptness
with
which
Mary
declare
her
own
iniquity
almost
take
away
her
ladyship
's
breath
.
<EOS>
She
have
certainly
believe
that
they
be
engage
,
and
have
hardly
hope
that
Mary
would
deny
it
;
but
she
have
not
expect
that
the
crime
would
be
acknowledge
,
or
,
at
any
rate
,
if
acknowledge
,
that
the
confession
would
be
make
without
some
show
of
shame
.
<EOS>
on
this
Lady
Arabella
could
have
work
;
but
there
be
no
such
expression
,
nor
be
there
the
slight
hesitation
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
engage
to
Frank
Gresham
,
"
and
have
so
say
,
Mary
look
her
visitor
full
in
the
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
it
be
indeed
impossible
that
you
should
be
receive
at
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
at
present
,
quite
so
,
no
doubt
:
in
say
so
,
Lady
Arabella
,
you
only
repeat
the
answer
I
make
to
your
first
question
.
<EOS>
I
can
now
go
to
Greshamsbury
only
in
one
light
:
that
of
Mr
Gresham
's
accept
daughter
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
that
be
perfectly
out
of
the
question
;
altogether
out
of
the
question
,
now
and
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
dispute
with
you
about
that
;
but
,
as
I
say
before
,
my
being
at
Beatrice
's
wedding
be
not
to
be
think
of
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
sit
for
a
while
silent
,
that
she
may
meditate
,
if
possible
,
calmly
as
to
what
line
of
argument
she
have
now
better
take
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
foolish
in
her
,
she
think
,
to
return
home
,
have
merely
express
her
anger
.
<EOS>
She
have
now
an
opportunity
of
talk
to
Mary
which
may
not
again
occur
:
the
difficulty
be
in
decide
in
what
special
way
she
should
use
the
opportunity
.
<EOS>
Should
she
threaten
,
or
should
she
entreat
?
<EOS>
to
do
her
justice
,
it
should
be
state
,
that
she
do
actually
believe
that
the
marriage
be
all
but
impossible
;
she
do
not
think
that
it
could
take
place
.
<EOS>
but
the
engagement
may
be
the
ruin
of
her
son
's
prospect
,
see
how
he
have
before
him
one
imperative
,
one
immediate
duty
 
<EOS>
that
of
marry
money
.
  
<EOS>
have
consider
all
this
as
well
as
her
hurry
would
allow
her
,
she
determine
first
to
reason
,
then
to
entreat
,
and
lastly
,
if
necessary
,
to
threaten
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
astonished
!
<EOS>
you
can
not
be
surprised
at
that
,
Miss
Thorne
:
I
be
astonish
at
hear
so
singular
a
confession
make
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
my
confession
singular
,
or
be
it
the
fact
of
my
be
engage
to
your
son
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
pass
over
that
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
but
do
let
me
ask
you
<EOS>
,
do
you
think
it
possible
,
I
say
possible
,
that
you
and
Frank
should
be
marry
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
certainly
;
quite
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
know
that
he
have
not
a
shilling
in
the
world

<EOS>
"
nor
have
I
,
Lady
Arabella
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
nor
will
he
have
be
he
to
do
anything
so
utterly
hostile
to
his
father
's
wish
.
<EOS>
the
property
,
you
be
aware
,
be
altogether
at
Mr
Gresham
's
disposal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
aware
of
nothing
about
the
property
,
and
can
say
nothing
about
it
except
this
,
that
it
have
not
be
,
and
will
not
be
inquire
after
by
me

if
I

it

<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
make
such
an
apparent
boast

you
force
me
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
on
what
then
be
you
to
live
?
<EOS>
You
be
too
old
for
love
in
a
cottage
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
at
all
too
old
;
Frank
,
you
know
be

still
quite
a
boy

"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
impudent
hussy
!

<EOS>
such
be
the
epithet
which
rise
to
Lady
Arabella
's
mind
;
but
she
politely
suppress
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Thorne
,
this
subject
be
of
course
to
me
very
serious
;
very
ill
-
adapt
for
jesting
.
<EOS>
I
look
upon
such
a
marriage
as
absolutely
impossible
.

<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
you
mean
by
impossible
,
Lady
Arabella

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
in
the
first
place
,
that
you
two
could
not
get
yourself
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
;
Mr
Oriel
would
manage
that
for
us
.
<EOS>
We
be
his
parishioner
,

he
would
be
bind
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
;
I
believe
that
under
all
the
circumstance
it
would
be
illegal
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
smile
;
but
she
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
laugh
,
Miss
Thorne
,
but
I
think
you
will
find
that
I
be
right
.
<EOS>
there
be
still
law
to
prevent
such
fearful
distress
as
would
be
bring
about
by
such
a
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
that
nothing
I
shall
do
will
bring
distress
on
the
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
but
it
would
;
do
not
you
know
that
it
would
?
<EOS>
think
of
it
,
Miss
Thorne
.
<EOS>
think
of
Frank
's
state
,
and
of
his
father
's
state
.
<EOS>
You
know
enough
of
that
,
I
be
sure
,
to
be
well
aware
that
Frank
be
not
in
a
condition
to
marry
without
money
.
<EOS>
think
of
the
position
which
Mr
Gresham
's
only
son
should
hold
in
the
county
;
think
of
the
old
name
,
and
the
pride
we
have
in
it
;
you
have
live
among
us
enough
to
understand
all
this
;
think
of
these
thing
,
and
then
say
whether
it
be
possible
such
a
marriage
should
take
place
without
family
distress
of
the
deep
kind
.
<EOS>
think
of
Mr
Gresham
;
if
you
truly
love
my
son
,
you
could
not
wish
to
bring
on
him
all
this
misery
and
ruin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
now
be
touch
,
for
there
be
truth
in
what
Lady
Arabella
say
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
no
power
of
go
back
;
her
troth
be
plight
,
and
nothing
that
any
human
being
could
say
should
shake
her
from
it
.
<EOS>
if
he
,
indeed
,
choose
to
repent
,
that
would
be
another
thing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Arabella
,
"
she
say
,

I
have
nothing
to

that

<EOS>
"

be
that
a
reason

Mary

"

to
me
it
be

a

a
law

my

you

keep
your

to
his

<EOS>
"
I

not

<EOS>
Our
engagement

shall
choose

off

must
necessarily
be
a
long
one
;

the
time
will
come

what
!

when
Mr

be
dead

before
that

"
  
<EOS>

there
be
no

and
because
he

headstrong

you

who
have
always

credit
for
so
much
sense

will
hold
him
to
this
mad
engagement

<EOS>

no

Lady

I
will
not

him

anything

<EOS>
nothing
that
you
can

shall
move
me

nothing
that
anybody
can
say
shall
induce
me
to
break
my
promise
to
him

<EOS>
but
a
word
from
himself
will
do
it
.
<EOS>
one
look
will
be
sufficient
.
<EOS>
let
him
give
me
to
understand
,
in
any
way
,
that
his
love
for
me
be
injurious
to
him
 
that
he
have
learn
to
think
so
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
will
renounce
my
part
in
this
engagement
as
quickly
as
you
could
wish
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
much
in
this
promise
,
but
still
not
so
much
as
Lady
Arabella
wish
to
get
.
<EOS>
Mary
,
she
know
,
be
obstinate
,
but
yet
reasonable
;
Frank
,
she
think
,
be
both
obstinate

unreasonable
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
possible
to
work
on
Mary
's
reason

quite
impossible
to
touch
Frank
's
irrationality

<EOS>
so
she
persevere
 
foolishly
.
  
<EOS>
"

you

no

exactly

therefore

step
must

<EOS>
then
Mary
rise
from

for
it
be
no

possible
for

to
speak
what
it
be

there
leisurely
on

worship
of

not

forward
in

conversation
as
to
give

unpardonable
offence

her
indignation

grand

more

Lady

that
it

so

our
further
talking

useless

take

your
sense

word
giving

he
have
profess
to
 
to
love
me

as
she
speak
,
she
still
look
on
the
lady
's
face
,
but
her
eyelash
for
a
moment
screen
her
eye

and
her
colour
be
a
little
heightened
 
"
<EOS>
and
I
have
acknowledge
that
I
also
love
him
,
and
so
we
be
engage
.
<EOS>
to
me
my
promise
be
sacred
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
be
threaten
into
break
it

<EOS>
if
,
however
,
he
shall
wish
to
change
his
mind
,
he
can
do
so

<EOS>
I
will
not
upbraid
him
;
will
not
,
if
I
can
help
it
,
think
harshly
of
him
.
<EOS>
so
much
you
may
tell
him
if
it
suit
you
;
but
I
will
not
listen
to
your
calculation
as
to
how
much
or
how
little
each
of
us
may
have
to
give
to
the
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
still
stand
when
she
finish
speak
,
and
so
she
continue
to
stand
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
be
fix
on
Lady
Arabella
,
and
her
position
seem
to
say
that
sufficient
word
have
be
speak
,
and
that
it
be
time
that
her
ladyship
should
go
;
and
so
Lady
Arabella
feel
it
.
<EOS>
gradually
she
also
rise
;
slowly
,
but
tacitly
,
she
acknowledge
that
she
be
in
the
presence
of
a
spirit
superior
to
her
own
;
and
so
she
take
her
leave
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
she
say
,
in
a
tone
that
be
intend
to
be
grandiloquent
,
but
which
fail
grievously
;
"
I
will
tell
him
that
he
have
your
permission
to
think
a
second
time
on
this
matter

<EOS>
I
do
not
doubt

that
he
will
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
Mary
would
not
condescend
to
answer
,
but
curtsy
low
as
her
visitor
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
and
so
the
interview
be
over
.
  
<EOS>
the
interview
be
over
,
and
Mary
be
alone
.
<EOS>
She
remain
stand
as
long
as
she
hear
the
footstep
of
Frank
's
mother
on
the
stair
;
not
immediately
think
of
what
have
pass
,
but
still
buoy
herself
up
with
her
hot
indignation
,
as
though
her
work
with
Lady
Arabella
be
not
yet
finish
;
but
when
the
footfall
be
no
longer
hear
,
and
the
sound
of
the
closing
door
tell
her
that
she
be
in
truth
alone
,
she
sink
back
in
her
seat
,
and
,
cover
her
face
with
her
hand
,
burst
into
bitter
tear
.
  
<EOS>
all
that
doctrine
about
money
be
horrible
to
her
;
that
insolent
pretence
,
that
she
have
catch
at
Frank
because
of
his
worldly
position
,
make
her
all
but
ferocious
;
but
Lady
Arabella
have
not
the
less
spoken
much
that
be
true
.
<EOS>
She
do
think
of
the
position
which
the
heir
of
Greshamsbury
should
hold
in
the
county
,
and
of
the
fact
that
a
marriage
would
mar
that
position
so
vitally
;
she
do
think
of
the
old
name
,
and
the
old
Gresham
pride
;
she
do
think
of
the
squire
and
his
deep
distress
<EOS>
:
it
be
true
that
she
have
live
among
them
long
enough
to
understand
these
thing
,
and
to
know
that
it
be
not
possible
that
this
marriage
should
take
place
without
deep
family
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
she
ask
herself
whether
,
in
consent
to
accept
Frank
's
hand
,
she
have
adequately
consider
this
;
and
she
be
force
to
acknowledge
that
she
have
not
consider
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
ridicule
Lady
Arabella
for
say
that
Frank
be
still
a
boy
;
but
be
it
not
true
that
his
offer
have
be
make
with
a
boy
's
energy
,
rather
than
a
man
's
forethought
?
<EOS>
if
so
,
if
she
have
be
wrong
to
accede
to
that
offer
when
make
,
would
she
not
be
doubly
wrong
to
hold
him
to
it
now
that
she
see
their
error
?
  
<EOS>
It
be
doubtless
true
that
Frank
himself
could
not
be
the
first
to
draw
back
.
<EOS>
what
would
people
say
of
him
?
<EOS>
She
could
now
calmly
ask
herself
the
question
that
have
so
anger
her
when
ask
by
Lady
Arabella
.
<EOS>
if
he
could
not
do
it
,
and
if
,
nevertheless
,
it
behove
them
to
break
off
this
match
,
by
whom
be
it
to
be
do
if
not
by
her
?
<EOS>
be
not
Lady
Arabella
<EOS>
right
throughout
,
right
in
her
conclusion
,
though
so
foully
wrong
in
her
manner
of
draw
them
?
  
<EOS>
and
then
she
do
think
for
one
moment
of
herself
.
<EOS>
"
You
who
have
nothing
to
give
in
return
!
"
such
have
be
Lady
Arabella
's
main
accusation
against
her
.
<EOS>
be
it
in
fact
true
that
she
have
nothing
to
give
?
<EOS>
Her
maiden
love
,
her
feminine
pride
,
her
very
life
,
and
spirit
,
and
be
 
be
these
thing
nothing
?
<EOS>
be
they
to
be
weigh
against
pound
sterling
per
annum
?
<EOS>
and
,
when
so
weigh
,
be
they
ever
to
kick
the
beam
like
feather
?
<EOS>
all
these
thing
have
be
nothing
to
her
<EOS>
when
,
without
reflection
,
govern
wholly
by
the
impulse
of
the
moment
,
she
have
first
allow
his
daring
hand
to
lie
for
an
instant
in
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
have
think
nothing
of
these
thing
when
that
other
suitor
come
,
richer
far
than
Frank
,
to
love
whom
it
be
as
impossible
to
her
as
it
be
not
to
love
him
.
  
<EOS>
Her
love
have
be
pure
from
all
such
thought
;
she
be
conscious
that
it
ever
would
be
pure
from
them
.
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
be
unable
to
comprehend
this
,
and
,
therefore
,
be
Lady
Arabella
so
utterly
distasteful
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Frank
have
once
hold
her
close
to
his
warm
breast
;
and
her
very
soul
have
thrill
with
joy
to
feel
that
he
so
love
her
,
 
with
a
joy
which
she
have
hardly
dare
to
acknowledge
.
<EOS>
at
that
moment
,
her
maidenly
effort
have
be
make
to
push
him
off
,
but
her
heart
have
grow
to
his
.
<EOS>
She
have
acknowledge
him
to
be
master
of
her
spirit
;
her
bosom
's
lord
;
the
man
whom
she
have
be
bear
to
worship
;
the
human
being
to
whom
it
be
for
her
to
link
her
destiny
.
<EOS>
Frank
's
acre
have
be
of
no
account
;
nor
have
his
want
of
acre
.
<EOS>
God
have
bring
them
two
together
that
they
should
love
each
other
;
that
conviction
have
satisfy
her
,
and
she
have
make
it
a
duty
to
herself
that
she
would
love
him
with
her
very
soul
.
<EOS>
and
now
she
be
call
upon
to
wrench
herself
asunder
from
him
because
she
have
nothing
to
give
in
return
!
  
<EOS>
well
,
she
would
wrench
herself
asunder
,
as
far
as
such
wrenching
may
be
do
compatibly
with
her
solemn
promise
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
right
that
Frank
should
have
an
opportunity
offer
him
,
so
that
he
may
escape
from
his
position
without
disgrace
.
<EOS>
She
would
endeavour
to
give
him
this
opportunity
.
<EOS>
so
,
with
one
deep
sigh
,
she
arise
,
take
herself
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
and
sit
herself
down
again
so
that
the
wrenching
may
begin
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
,
for
a
moment
,
she
think
of
her
uncle
.
<EOS>
why
have
he
not
speak
to
her
of
all
this
?
<EOS>
why
have
he
not
warn
her
?
<EOS>
He
who
have
ever
be
so
good
to
her
,
why
have
he
now
fail
her
so
grievously
?
<EOS>
She
have
tell
him
everything
,
have
have
no
secret
from
him
;
but
he
have
never
answer
her
a
word
.
"
<EOS>
He
also
must
have
know
,
"
she
say
to
herself
,
piteously
,
"
he
also
must
have
know
that
I
could
give
nothing
in
return
.
"
<EOS>
such
accusation
,
however
,
avail
her
not
at
all
,
so
she
sit
down
and
slowly
write
her
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dearest
Frank
,
"
she
begin
.
<EOS>
She
have
at
first
write
"
dear
Mr
Gresham
;
"
but
her
heart
revolt
against
such
useless
coldness
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
go
to
pretend
she
do
not
love
him
.
  
<EOS>
DEAREST
FRANK
,
  
Your
mother
have
be
here
talk
to
me
about
our
engagement
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
generally
agree
with
her
about
such
matter
;
but
she
have
say
some
thing
to
-
day
which
I
can
not
but
acknowledge
to
be
true
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
that
our
marriage
would
be
distress
to
your
father
,
injurious
to
all
your
family
,
and
ruinous
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
if
this
be
so
,
how
can
I
,
who
love
you
,
wish
for
such
a
marriage
?
  
<EOS>
I
remember
my
promise
,
and
have
keep
it
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
yield
to
your
mother
when
she
desire
me
to
disclaim
our
engagement
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
think
it
will
be
more
prudent
if
you
will
consent
to
forget
all
that
have
pass
between
us
 
not
,
perhaps
,
to
forget
it
;
that
may
not
be
possible
for
us
 
but
to
let
it
pass
by
as
though
it
have
never
be
.
<EOS>
if
so
,
if
you
think
so
,
dear
Frank
,
do
not
have
any
scruple
on
my
account
.
<EOS>
what
will
be
good
for
you
,
must
be
good
for
me
.
<EOS>
think
what
a
reflection
it
would
ever
be
to
me
,
to
have
be
the
ruin
of
one
that
I
love
so
well
.
  
<EOS>
let
me
have
but
one
word
to
say
that
I
be
release
from
my
promise
,
and
I
will
tell
my
uncle
that
the
matter
between
us
be
over
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
painful
for
us
at
first
;
those
occasional
meeting
which
must
take
place
will
distress
us
,
but
that
will
wear
off
.
<EOS>
We
shall
always
think
well
of
each
other
,
and
why
should
we
not
be
friend
?
<EOS>
this
,
doubtless
,
can
not
be
do
without
inward
wound
;
but
such
wound
be
in
God
's
hand
,
and
He
can
cure
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
what
your
first
feeling
will
be
on
read
this
letter
;
but
do
not
answer
it
in
obedience
to
first
feeling
.
<EOS>
think
over
it
,
think
of
your
father
,
and
all
you
owe
him
,
of
your
old
name
,
your
old
family
,
and
of
what
the
world
expect
from
you
.
<EOS>
[
Mary
be
force
to
put
her
hand
to
her
eye
,
to
save
her
paper
from
her
fall
tear
,
as
she
find
herself
thus
repeat
,
nearly
word
for
word
,
the
argument
that
have
be
use
by
Lady
Arabella
.
]
<EOS>
think
of
these
thing
,
coolly
,
if
you
can
,
but
,
at
any
rate
,
without
passion
:
and
then
let
me
have
one
word
in
answer
.
<EOS>
one
word
will
suffice
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
but
to
add
this
:
do
not
allow
yourself
to
think
that
my
heart
will
ever
reproach
you
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
reproach
you
for
do
that
which
I
myself
suggest
.
<EOS>
[
Mary
's
logic
in
this
be
very
false
;
but
she
be
not
herself
aware
of
it
.
]
<EOS>
I
will
never
reproach
you
either
in
word
or
think
;
and
as
for
all
other
,
it
seem
to
me
that
the
world
agree
that
we
have
hitherto
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
the
world
,
I
hope
,
will
be
satisfied
when
we
have
obey
it
.
  
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
dearest
Frank
!
<EOS>
I
shall
never
call
you
so
again
;
but
it
would
be
a
pretence
<EOS>
be
I
to
write
otherwise
in
this
letter
.
<EOS>
think
of
this
,
and
then
let
me
have
one
line
.
  
<EOS>
Your
affectionate
friend
,
  
MARY
THORNE
.
  
<EOS>
P.S.
 
<EOS>
of
course
I
can
not
be
at
dear
Beatrice
's
marriage
;
but
when
they
come
back
to
the
parsonage
,
I
shall
see
her
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
they
will
both
be
happy
,
because
they
be
so
good
.
<EOS>
I
need
hardly
say
that
I
shall
think
of
them
on
their
wedding
day
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
have
finish
her
letter
,
she
address
it
plainly
,
in
her
own
somewhat
bold
handwriting
,
to
Francis
N.
Gresham
,
June
,
Esq
.
,
and
then
take
it
herself
to
the
little
village
post
-
office
.
<EOS>
there
should
be
nothing
underhand
about
her
correspondence
:
all
the
Greshamsbury
world
should
know
of
it
 
that
world
of
which
she
have
speak
in
her
letter
 
if
that
world
so
pleased
.
<EOS>
have
put
her
penny
label
on
it
,
she
hand
it
,
with
an
open
brow
and
an
unembarrassed
face
,
to
the
baker
's
wife
,
who
be
Her
Majesty
's
postmistress
at
Greshamsbury
;
and
,
have
so
finish
her
work
,
she
return
to
see
the
table
prepare
for
her
uncle
's
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
say
nothing
to
him
,
"
say
she
to
herself
,
"
till
I
get
the
answer
.
<EOS>
He
will
not
talk
to
me
about
it
,
so
why
should
I
trouble
him
?
"
   
<EOS>

race
of
Scatcherd
Becomes
Extinct
 
<EOS>
It
will
not
be
imagine
,
at
any
rate
by
feminine
reader
,
that
Mary
's
letter
be
write
off
at
once
,
without
alteration
and
change
,
or
the
necessity
for
a
fair
copy
.
<EOS>
letter
from
one
young
lady
to
another
be
doubtless
write
in
this
manner
,
and
even
with
them
it
may
sometimes
be
well
if
more
patience
have
be
take
;
but
with
Mary
's
first
letter
to
her
lover
 
<EOS>
her
first
love
-
letter
,
if
love
-
letter
it
can
be
call
 
much
more
care
be
use
.
<EOS>
It
be
copy
and
re
-
copy
,
and
when
she
return
from
post
it
,
it
be
read
and
re
-
read
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
cold
,
"
she
say
to
herself
;
"
he
will
think
I
have
no
heart
,
that
I
have
never
love
him
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
she
all
but
resolve
to
run
down
to
the
baker
's
wife
,
and
get
back
her
letter
,
that
she
may
alter
it
.
"
<EOS>
but
it
will
be
well
so
,
"
she
say
again
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
touch
his
feeling
now
,
he
would
never
bring
himself
to
leave
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
right
that
I
should
be
cold
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
false
to
myself
if
I
try
to
move
his
love
 
<EOS>
I
,
who
have
nothing
to
give
him
in
return
for
it
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
she
make
no
further
visit
to
the
post
-
office
,
and
the
letter
go
on
its
way
.
  
<EOS>
We
will
now
follow
its
fortune
for
a
short
while
,
and
explain
how
it
be
that
Mary
receive
no
answer
for
a
week
;
a
week
,
it
may
well
be
imagine
,
of
terrible
suspense
to
her
.
<EOS>
when
she
take
it
to
the
post
-
office
,
she
doubtless
think
that
the
baker
's
wife
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
send
it
up
to
the
house
at
Greshamsbury
,
and
that
Frank
would
receive
it
that
evening
,
or
,
at
late
,
early
on
the
following
morning
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
by
no
means
so
.
<EOS>
the
epistle
be
post
on
a
Friday
afternoon
,
and
it
behove
the
baker
's
wife
to
send
it
into
Silverbridge
 
Silverbridge
be
the
post
-
town
 
so
that
all
due
formality
,
as
order
by
the
Queen
's
Government
,
may
there
be
perfect
.
<EOS>
now
,
unfortunately
,
the
post
-
boy
have
take
his
departure
before
Mary
reach
the
shop
,
and
it
be
not
,
therefore
,
dispatch
till
Saturday
.
<EOS>
Sunday
be
always
a
_
die
non

with
the
Greshamsbury
Mercury
,
and
,
consequently
,
Frank
's
letter
be
not
deliver
at
the
house
till
Monday
morning
;
at
which
time
Mary
have
for
two
long
day
be
wait
with
weary
heart
for
the
expect
answer
.
  
<EOS>
now
Frank
have
on
that
morning
go
up
to
London
by
the
early
train
,
with
his
future
brother
-
in
-
law
,
Mr
Oriel
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
accomplish
this
,
they
have
leave
Greshamsbury
for
Barchester
exactly
as
the
postboy
be
leave
Silverbridge
for
Greshamsbury
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
wait
for
my
letter

Mr

have
say
,
when
the
journey
be
be

Frank
have
answer
.
<EOS>
"
who
ever
get
a
letter
that
be
worth
wait
for
?

<EOS>
and
so
Mary
be
doom
to
a
week
of
misery
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
post
-
bag
arrive
at
the
house
on
Monday
morning
,
it
be
open
as
usual
by
the
squire
himself
at
the
breakfast

table
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
be
a
letter
for
Frank

he

"
post
in

<EOS>
You
have
better

and
he
throw
the
letter
across
the
table
to
Beatrice
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
from
Mary

"
say
Beatrice
,
out
loud
,
take
the
letter
up
and
examine
the
address
.
<EOS>
and
have
say
so
,
she
repent
what
she
have
do
,
as
she
look
first
at
her
father
and
then
at
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
a
cloud
come
over
the
squire
's
brow
as
for
a
minute
he
go
on
turn
over
the
letter
and
newspaper
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
from
Mary
Thorne
,
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
have
better
send
it
to
him

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Frank
say
that
if
any
letter

they
be
to

say
his
sister
Sophy

"
<EOS>
He
tell
me
so
particularly

I
do
not
think
he
like
have
letter
send
after
him

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
send
that
one

say
the
squire

<EOS>
"
Mr
Oriel
be
to
have
all
his
letter
address

Long
's
Hotel

Bond
Street

and
this
one
can
very
well
be
send
with
them
,
"
say
Beatrice
,
who
know
all
about
it
,
and
intend
herself
to
make
a
free
use
of
the
address
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
you
have
better
send
it
,
"
say
the
squire
;
and
then
nothing
further
be
say
at
the
table
.
<EOS>
but
Lady
Arabella
,
though
she
say
nothing
,
have
not
fail
to
mark
what
have
pass
.
<EOS>
have
she
ask
for
the
letter
before
the
squire
,
he
would
probably
have
take
possession
of
it
himself
;
but
as
soon
as
she
be
alone
with
Beatrice
,
she
do
demand
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
write
to
Frank
myself
,
"
she
say
,
"
and
will
send
it
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
,
Beatrice
,
with
a
heavy
heart
,
give
it
up
.
  
<EOS>
the
letter
lie
before
Lady
Arabella
's
eye
all
that
day
,
and
many
a
wistful
glance
be
cast
at
it
.
<EOS>
She
turn
it
over
and
over
,
and
much
she
desire
to
know
its
content
;
but
she
do
not
dare
to
break
the
seal
of
her
son
's
letter
.
<EOS>
all
that
day
it
lie
upon
her
desk
,
and
all
the
next
,
for
she
could
hardly
bring
herself
to
part
with
it
;
but
on
the
Wednesday
it
be
send
 
send
with
these
line
from
herself
:
    
"
Dearest
,
dear
Frank
<EOS>
,
I
send
you
a
letter
which
have
come
by
the
post
from
Mary
Thorne
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
it
may
contain
;
but
before
you
correspond
with
her
,
pray
,
pray
think
of
what
I
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
for
my
sake
,
for
your
father
's
,
for
your
own
,
pray
think
of
it

"
  
<EOS>
that
be
all
,
but
it
be
enough
to
make
her
word
to
Beatrice
true
.
<EOS>
She
do
send
it
to
Frank
enclose
in
a
letter
from
herself
.
<EOS>
We
must
reserve
to
the
next
chapter
what
have
take
place
between
Frank
and
his
mother
;
but
,
for
the
present
,
we
will
return
to
the
doctor
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
say
not
a
word
to
him
about
the

but
,
keep
silent
on
the
subject
<EOS>
,
she
feel
wretchedly
estranged
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
be
anything
the
matter
,
Mary
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
to
her
on
the
Sunday
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
uncle
,
"
she
answer
,
turn
away
her
head
to
hide
her
tear
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
but
there
be
something
;
what
be
it
,
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
 
that
is
,
nothing
that
one
can
talk
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
Mary
!
<EOS>
be
unhappy
and
not
to
talk
about
it
to
me
?
<EOS>
that
be
something
new
,
be
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
one
have
presentiment
sometimes
,
and
be
unhappy
without
know
why
.
<EOS>
besides
,
you
know
 
"
  
"
I
know
!
<EOS>
what
do
I
know
?
<EOS>
do
I
know
anything
that
will
make
my
pet
happier
?
"
<EOS>
and
he
take
her
in
his
arm
as
they
sit
together
on
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
Her
tear
be
now
fall
fast
,
and
she
no
longer
make
an
effort
to
hide
them
.
<EOS>
"
speak
to
me
,
Mary
;
this
be
more
than
a
presentiment
.
<EOS>
what
be
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
uncle
 
"
  
"
come
,
love
,
speak
to
me
;
tell
me
why
you
be
grieve
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
uncle
,
why
have
you
not
speak
to
me
?
<EOS>
why
have
you
not
tell
me
what
to
do
?
<EOS>
why
have
you
not
advise
me
?
<EOS>
why
be
you
always
so
silent
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
silent
about
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
uncle
,
you
know
;
silent
about
him
;
silent
about
Frank
.
"
  
<EOS>
why
,
indeed
?
<EOS>
what
be
he
to
say
to
this
?
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
he
have
never
counsel
her
;
never
show
her
what
course
she
should
take
;
have
never
even
speak
to
her
about
her
lover
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
equally
true
that
he
be
not
now
prepared
to
do
so
,
even
in
answer
to
such
an
appeal
as
this
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
hope
,
a
strong
hope
,
more
than
a
hope
,
that
Mary
's
love
would
yet
be
happy
;
but
he
could
not
express
or
explain
his
hope
;
nor
could
he
even
acknowledge
to
himself
a
wish
that
would
seem
to
be
base
on
the
death
of
him
whose
life
he
be
bind
,
if
possible
,
to
preserve
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
"
he
say
,
"
it
be
a
matter
in
which
you
must
judge
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
do
I
doubt
your
conduct
,
I
should
interfere
;
but
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
conduct
!
<EOS>
be
conduct
everything
?
<EOS>
one
may
conduct
oneself
excellently
,
and
yet
break
one
's
heart
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
too
much
for
the
doctor
;
his
sternness
and
firmness
instantly
desert
him
.
"
<EOS>
Mary
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
will
do
anything
that
you
would
have
me
.
<EOS>
if
you
wish
it
,
I
will
make
arrangement
for
leave
this
place
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
"
she
say
,
plaintively
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
you
tell
me
of
a
broken
heart
,
you
almost
break
my
own
.
<EOS>
come
to
me
,
darle
<EOS>
;
do
not
leave
me
so
.
<EOS>
I
will
say
all
that
I
can
say
.
<EOS>
I
have
think
,
do
still
think
,
that
circumstance
will
admit
of
your
marriage
with
Frank
if
you
both
love
each
other
,
and
can
both
be
patient
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
so
,
"
say
she
,
unconsciously
slide
her
hand
into
his
,
as
though
to
thank
him
by
its
pressure
for
the
comfort
he
be
give
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
think
so
now
more
than
ever
.
<EOS>
but
I
only
think
so
;
I
have
be
unable
to
assure
you
.
<EOS>
there
,
darling
,
I
must
not
say
more
;
only
that
I
can
not
bear
to
see
you
grieve
,
I
would
not
have
say
this
:
"
and
then
he
leave
her
,
and
nothing
more
be
speak
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
if
you
can
be
patient
!
<EOS>
why
,
a
patience
of
ten
year
would
be
as
nothing
to
her
.
<EOS>
Could
<EOS>
she
but
live
with
the
knowledge
that
she
be
first
in
his
estimation
,
dear
in
his
heart
;
could
it
be
also
grant
to
her
to
feel
that
she
be
regard
as
his
equal
,
she
could
be
patient
for
ever
.
<EOS>
what
more
do
she
want
than
to
know
and
feel
this
?
<EOS>
patient
,
indeed
!
  
<EOS>
but
what
could
these
circumstance
be
to
which
her
uncle
have
allude
?
<EOS>
"
I
do
think
that
circumstance
will
admit
of
your
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
such
be
his
opinion
,
and
she
have
never
know
him
to
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
circumstance
!
<EOS>
what
circumstance
?
<EOS>
do
he
perhaps
mean
that
Mr
Gresham
's
affair
be
not
so
bad
as
they
have
be
think
to
be
?
<EOS>
if
so
,
that
alone
would
hardly
alter
the
matter
,
for
what
could
she
give
in
return
?
<EOS>
"
I
would
give
him
the
world
for
one
word
of
love
,
"
she
say
to
herself
,
"
and
never
think
that
he
be
my
debtor
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
how
beggarly
the
heart
must
be
that
speculate
on
such
gift
as
those
!
"
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
her
uncle
's
opinion
<EOS>
:
he
still
think
that
they
may
be
married
.
<EOS>
oh
,
why
have
she
send
her
letter
?
<EOS>
and
why
have
she
make
it
so
cold
?
<EOS>
with
such
a
letter
as
that
before
him
,
Frank
could
not
do
other
than
consent
to
her
proposal
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
why
do
he
not
at
least
answer
it
?
  
<EOS>
on
the
Sunday
afternoon
there
arrive
at
Greshamsbury
a
man
and
a
horse
from
Boxall
Hill
,
bear
a
letter
from
Lady
Scatcherd
to
Dr
Thorne
,
earnestly
request
the
doctor
's
immediate
attendance
.
<EOS>
"
I
fear
everything
be
over
with
poor
Louis
,
"
write
the
unhappy
mother
.
<EOS>
"
It
have
be
very
dreadful
.
<EOS>
do
come
to
me
;
I
have
no
other
friend
,
and
I
be
nearly
wear
through
with
it

<EOS>
the
man
from
the
city
"
 
<EOS>
she
mean
Dr
Fillgrave
 
"
come
every
day
,
and
I
dare
say
he
be
all
very
well
,
but
he
have
never
do
much
good
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
have
spirit
enough
to
keep
the
bottle
from
him
;
and
it
be
that
,
and
that
only
,
that
most
behove
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
you
will
not
find
him
in
this
world
when
you
arrive
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
start
immediately
.
<EOS>
even
though
he
may
have
to
meet
Dr
Fillgrave
,
he
could
not
hesitate
,
for
he
go
not
as
a
doctor
to
the
die
man
,
but
as
the
trustee
under
Sir
Roger
's
will
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
as
Lady
Scatcherd
have
say
,
he
be
her
only
friend
,
and
he
could
not
desert
her
at
such
a
moment
for
an
army
of
Fillgraves
.
<EOS>
He
tell
Mary
he
should
not
return
that
night
;
and
take
with
him
a
small
saddle
-
bag
,
he
start
at
once
for
Boxall
Hill
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
ride
up
to
the
hall
door
,
Dr
Fillgrave
be
get
into
his
carriage
.
<EOS>
They
have
never
meet
so
as
to
speak
to
each
other
since
that
memorable
day
,
when
they
have
their
famous
passage
of
arm
in
the
hall
of
that
very
house
before
which
they
both
now
stand
.
<EOS>
but
,
at
the
present
moment
,
neither
of
them
be
dispose
to
renew
the
fight
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
news
of
your
patient
,
Dr
Fillgrave
?
"
say
our
doctor
,
still
seated
on
his
sweating
horse
,
and
put
his
hand
lightly
to
his
hat
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Fillgrave
could
not
refrain
from
one
moment
of
supercilious
disdain
:
he
give
one
little
chuck
to
his
head
,
one
little
twist
to
his
neck
,
one
little
squeeze
to
his
lip
,
and
then
the
man
within
him
overcome
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
be
no
more
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
's
will
be
do
!
"
say
Dr
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
death
be
a
release
;
for
his
last
day
have
be
very
frightful
.
<EOS>
Your
coming
,
Dr
Thorne
,
will
be
a
comfort
to
Lady
Scatcherd
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
Dr
Fillgrave
,
think
that
even
the
present
circumstance
require
no
further
condescension
,
ensconce
himself
in
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
last
day
have
be
very
dreadful
!
<EOS>
ah
,
me
,
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
Dr
Fillgrave
,
before
you
go
,
allow
me
to
say
this
:
I
be
quite
aware
that
when
he
fall
into
your
hand
,
no
medical
skill
in
the
world
could
save
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dr
Fillgrave
bow
low
from
the
carriage
,
and
after
this
unwonted
exchange
of
courtesy
,
the
two
doctor
part
,
not
to
meet
again
 
at
any
rate
,
in
the
page
of
this
novel
.
<EOS>
of
Dr
Fillgrave
,
let
it
now
be
say
,
that
he
grow
in
dignity
as
he
grow
in
year
,
and
that
he
be
universally
regard
as
one
of
the
celebrity
of
the
city
of
Barchester
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Scatcherd
be
find
sit
alone
in
her
little
room
on
the
ground
-
floor
.
<EOS>
even
Hannah
be
not
with
her
,
for
Hannah
be
now
occupy
upstairs
.
<EOS>
when
the
doctor
enter
the
room
,
which
he
do
unannounce
,
he
find
her
seat
on
a
chair
,
with
her
back
against
one
of
the
press
,
her
hand
clasp
together
over
her
knee
,
gaze
into
vacancy
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
ever
hear
him
or
see
him
as
he
approach
,
and
his
hand
have
slightly
touch
her
shoulder
before
she
know
that
she
be
not
alone
.
<EOS>
then
,
she
look
up
at
him
with
a
face
so
full
of
sorrow
,
so
worn
with
suffering
,
that
his
own
heart
be
rack
to
see
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
over
,
my
friend
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
well
so
;
much
better
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
seem
at
first
hardly
to
understand
him
,
but
still
regard
him
with
that
wan
face
,
shake
her
head
slowly
and
sadly
.
<EOS>
one
may
have
think
that
she
be
twenty
year
old
than
when
Dr
Thorne
last
see
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
draw
a
chair
to
her
side
,
and
sit
by
her
,
take
her
hand
in
his
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
well
so
,
Lady
Scatcherd
;
better
so
,
"
he
repeat
.
<EOS>
"
the
poor
lad
's
doom
have
be
speak
,
and
it
be
well
for
him
,
and
for
you
,
that
it
should
be
over
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
both
go
now
,
"
say
she
,
speak
very
low
;
"
both
go
now
.
<EOS>
oh
,
doctor
!
<EOS>
to
be
leave
alone
here
,
all
alone
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
say
some
few
word
try
to
comfort
her
;
but
who
can
comfort
a
widow
bereave
of
her
child
?
<EOS>
who
can
console
a
heart
that
have
lose
all
that
it
possess
?
<EOS>
Sir
Roger
have
not
be
to
her
a
tender
husband
;
but
still
he
have
be
the
husband
of
her
love
.
<EOS>
Sir
Louis
have
not
be
to
her
an
affectionate
son
;
but
still
he
have
be
her
child
,
her
only
child
.
<EOS>
now
they
be
both
go
.
<EOS>
who
can
wonder
that
the
world
should
be
a
blank
to
her
?
  
<EOS>
still
the
doctor
speak
soothing
word
,
and
still
he
hold
her
hand
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
his
word
could
not
console
her
;
but
the
sound
of
his
kindness
at
such
desolate
moment
be
,
to
such
mind
as
her
,
some
alleviation
of
grief
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
answer
him
,
but
sit
there
stare
out
before
her
,
leave
her
hand
passively
to
him
,
and
sway
her
head
backwards
and
forwards
as
though
her
grief
be
too
heavy
to
be
bear
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
her
eye
rest
on
an
article
which
stand
upon
the
table
,
and
she
start
up
impetuously
from
her
chair
.
<EOS>
She
do
this
so
suddenly
,
that
the
doctor
's
hand
fall
beside
him
before
he
know
that
she
have

<EOS>
the
table
be
cover
with
all
those
implement
which
become
so
frequent
about
a
house
when

<EOS>
there

<EOS>
there

on
a
plate
,
a

shaped
glass
utensil

the
doctor
,
and
sundry
piece
of
flannel
,
which
have
be
use
in
rub

sufferer

<EOS>
but
in
the
middle
of
the
débris
stand
one
black

with
head
erect
,
unsuite

the
companionship
in

<EOS>
"

"
<EOS>
and
then
she
let

what
have
come
of
it
;
see
what
have
come
of
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
could
not
remain
with
her
long
,
as
it
be
necessary
that
he
should
take
upon
himself
the
direction
of
the
household
,
and
give
order
for
the
funeral
.
<EOS>
first
of
all
,
he
have
to
undergo
the
sad
duty
of
see
the
corpse
of
the
deceased
baronet
.
<EOS>
this
,
at
any
rate
,
may
be
spare
to
my
reader
.
<EOS>
It
be
find
to
be
necessary
that
the
interment
should
be
make
very
quickly
,
as
the
body
be
already
nearly
destroy
by
alcohol
.
<EOS>
have
do
all
this
,
and
send
back
his
horse
to
Greshamsbury
,
with
direction
that
clothe
for
a
journey
may
be
send
to
him
,
and
a
notice
that
he
should
not
be
home
for
some
day
,
he
again
return
to
Lady
Scatcherd
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
he
could
not
but
think
much
of
the
immense
property
which
be
now
,
for
a
short
time
,
altogether
in
his
own
hand
.
<EOS>
His
resolution
be
soon
make
to
go
at
once
to
London
and
consult
the
good
lawyer
he
could
find
 
or
the
good
dozen
lawyer
<EOS>
should
such
be
necessary
 
as
to
the
validity
of
Mary
's
claim
.
<EOS>
this
must
be
do
before
he
say
a
word
to
her
or
to
any
of
the
Gresham
family
;
but
it
must
be
do
instantly
,
so
that
all
suspense
may
be
at
an
end
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
He
must
,
of
course
,
remain
with
Lady
Scatcherd
till
the
funeral
should
be
over
;
but
when
that
office
should
be
complete
,
he
would
start
instantly
for
London
.
  
<EOS>
in
resolve
to
tell
no
one
as
to
Mary
's
fortune
till
after
he
have
fortify
himself
with
legal
warranty
,
he
make
one
exception
.
<EOS>
He
think
it
rational
that
he
should
explain
to
Lady
Scatcherd
who
be
now
the
heir
under
her
husband
's
will
;
and
he
be
the
more
inclined
to
do
so
,
from
feel
that
the
news
would
probably
be
gratify
to
her
.
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
he
have
once
or
twice
endeavour
to
induce
her
to
talk
about
the
property
,
but
she
have
be
unwilling
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
dislike
all
allusion
to
it
,
and
it
be
not
till
she
have
incidentally
mention
the
fact
that
she
would
have
to
look
for
a
home
,
that
he
be
able
to
fix
her
to
the
subject
.
<EOS>
this
be
on
the
evening
before
the
funeral
;
on
the
afternoon
of
which
day
he
intend
to
proceed
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
probably
be
arrange
that
you
may
continue
to
live
here
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wish
it
at
all
,
"
say
she
,
rather
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wish
to
have
any
arrangement
make
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
be
indebte
to
any
of
them
for
anything
.
<EOS>
oh
,
dear
!
<EOS>
if
money
could
make
it
all
right
,
I
should
have
enough
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indebted
to
whom
,
Lady
Scatcherd
?
<EOS>
who
do
you
think
will
be
the
owner
of
Boxall
Hill
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
then
,
Dr
Thorne
,
I
do
not
much
care
:
unless
it
be
yourself
,
it
will
not
be
any
friend
of
mine
,
or
any
one
I
shall
care
to
make
a
friend
of
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
so
easy
for
an
old
woman
like
me
to
make
new
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
it
certainly
will
not
belong
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
it
do
,
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
but
even
then
,
I
would
not
live
here
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
too
many
trouble
here
to
wish
to
see
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
shall
be
just
as
you
like
,
Lady
Scatcherd
;
but
you
will
be
surprised
to
hear
that
the
place
will
 
at
least
I
think
it
will
 
belong
to
a
friend
of
yours
:
to
one
to
whom
you
have
be
very
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
who
be
he
,
doctor
?
<EOS>
will
not
it
go
to
some
of
those
Americans
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
never
do
anything
kind
to
them
;
though
,
indeed
,
I
do
love
poor
Mary
Scatcherd
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
year
upon
year
ago
,
and
she
be
dead
and
go
now
.
<EOS>
well
,
I
begrudge
nothing
to
Mary
's
child
.
<EOS>
as
I
have
none
of
my
own
,
it
be
right
they
should
have
the
money
.
<EOS>
It
have
not
make
me
happy
<EOS>
;
I
hope
it
may
do
so
to
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
property
will
,
I
think
,
go
to
Mary
Scatcherd
's
eld
child
.
<EOS>
It
be
she
whom
you
have
know
as
Mary
Thorne
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
doctor
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
Lady
Scatcherd
,
as
she
make
the
exclamation
,
put
both
her
hand
down
to
hold
her
chair
,
as
though
she
fear
the
weight
of
her
surprise
would
topple
her
off
her
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
;
Mary
Thorne
 
<EOS>
my
Mary
 
to
whom
you
have
be
so
good
,
<EOS>
who
love
you
so
well
;
she
,
I
believe
,
will
be
Sir
Roger
's
heiress
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
so
that
Sir
Roger
intend
on
his
deathbed
,
<EOS>
in
the
event
of
poor
Louis
's
life
be
cut
short
.
<EOS>
if
this
be
so
,
will
you
be
ashamed
to
stay
here
as
the
guest
of
Mary
Thorne
?
<EOS>
She
have
not
be
ashamed
to
be
your
guest
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
Lady
Scatcherd
be
now
too
much
interested
in
the
general
tenor
of
the
news
which
she
have
hear
to
care
much
about
the
house
which
she
be
to
inhabit
in
future
.
<EOS>
Mary
Thorne
,
the
heiress
of
Boxall
Hill
!
<EOS>
Mary
Thorne
,
the
still
live
child
of
that
poor
creature
who
have
so
nearly
die
when
they
be
all
afflict
with
their
early
grief
!
<EOS>
well
;
there
be
consolation
<EOS>
,
there
be
comfort
in
this
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
three
people
leave
in
the
world
that
she
could
love
:
<EOS>
her
foster
-
child
,
Frank
Gresham
 
Mary
Thorne
,
and
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
if
the
money
go
to
Mary
,
it
would
of
course
go
to
Frank
,
for
she
now
know
that
they
love
each
other
;
and
if
it
go
to
them
,
would
not
the
doctor
have
his
share
also
;
such
share
as
he
may
want
?
<EOS>
Could
she
have
govern
the
matter
,
she
would
have
give
it
all
to
Frank
;
and
now
it
would
be
as
well
bestow
.
  
<EOS>
yes
;
there
be
consolation
in
this
.
<EOS>
They
both
sit
up
more
than
half
the
night
talk
over
it
,
and
give
and
receive
explanation
.
<EOS>
if
only
the
council
of
lawyer
would
not
be
adverse
!
<EOS>
that
be
now
the
point
of
suspense
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
before
he
leave
her
,
bade
her
hold
her
peace
,
and
say
nothing
of
Mary
's
fortune
to
any
one
till
her
right
have
be
absolutely
acknowledge
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
nothing
not
to
have
it
,
"
say
the
doctor
;
"
but
it
would
be
very
bad
to
hear
it
be
hers
,
and
then
to
lose
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
on
the
next
morning
,
Dr
Thorne
deposit
the
remain
of
Sir
Louis
in
the
vault
prepare
for
the
family
in
the
parish
church
.
<EOS>
He
lay
the
son
where
a
few
month
ago
he
have
lay
the
father
,
 
and
so
the
title
of
Scatcherd
become
extinct
.
<EOS>
Their
race
of
honour
have
not
be
long
.
  
<EOS>
after
the
funeral
,
the
doctor
hurry
up
to
London
,
and
there
we
will
leave
him
.
   
<EOS>
Saturday
Evening
and
Sunday
Morning
 
<EOS>
We
must
now
go
back
a
little
and
describe
how
Frank
have
be
send
off
on
special
business
to
London
.
<EOS>
the
household
at
Greshamsbury
be
at
this
time
in
but
a
doleful
state
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
be
pervade
,
from
the
squire
down
to
the
scullery
-
maid
,
with
a
feeling
that
thing
be
not
go
well
;
and
man
and
woman
,
in
spite
of
Beatrice
's
coming
marriage
,
be
grim
-
visaged
,
and
dolorous
.
<EOS>
Mr
Mortimer
Gazebee
,
reject
though
he
have
be
,
still
go
and
come
,
talk
much
to
the
squire
,
much
also
to
her
ladyship
,
as
to
the
ill
-
doing
which
be
in
the
course
of
projection
by
Sir
Louis
;
and
Frank
go
about
the
house
with
clouded
brow
,
as
though
finally
resolve
to
neglect
his
one
great
duty
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Beatrice
be
rob
of
half
her
joy
:
over
and
over
again
her
brother
ask
her
whether
she
have
yet
see
Mary
,
and
she
be
oblige
as
often
to
answer
that
she
have
not
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
do
not
dare
to
visit
her
friend
,
for
it
be
hardly
possible
that
they
should
sympathise
with
each
other
.
<EOS>
Mary
be
,
to
say
the
least
,
stubborn
in
her
pride
;
and
Beatrice
,
though
she
could
forgive
her
friend
for
love
her
brother
,
could
not
forgive
the
obstinacy
with
which
Mary
persist
in
a
course
which
,
as
Beatrice
think
,
she
herself
know
to
be
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
Mr
Gazebee
come
down
from
town
,
with
an
intimation
that
it
behove
the
squire
himself
to
go
up
that
he
may
see
certain
learned
pundit
,
and
be
badger
in
his
own
person
at
various
dingy
,
dismal
chamber
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
,
the
Temple
,
and
Gray
's
Inn
Lane
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
invitation
exactly
of
that
sort
which
a
good
many
year
ago
be
give
to
a
certain
duck
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
,
will
you
 
<EOS>
will
you
,
will
you
 
come
and
be
kill
?
"
<EOS>
although
Mr
Gazebee
urge
the
matter
with
such
eloquence
,
the
squire
remain
steady
to
his
objection
,
and
swam
obstinately
about
his
Greshamsbury
pond
in
any
direction
save
that
which
seem
to
lead
towards
London
.
  
<EOS>
this
occur
on
the
very
evening
of
that
Friday
which
have
witness
the
Lady
Arabella
's
last
visit
to
Dr
Thorne
's
house
.
<EOS>
the
question
of
the
squire
's
necessary
journey
to
the
great
fountain
of
justice
be
,
of
course
,
discuss
between
Lady
Arabella
and
Mr
Gazebee
;
and
it
occur
to
the
former
,
full
as
she
be
of
Frank
's
iniquity
and
of
Mary
's
obstinacy
,
that
if
Frank
be
send
up
in
lieu
of
his
father
,
it
would
separate
them
at
least
for
a
while
.
<EOS>
if
she
could
only
get
Frank
away
without
see
his
love
,
she
may
yet
so
work
upon
him
,
by
mean
of
the
message
which
Mary
have
send
,
as
to
postpone
,
if
not
break
off
,
this
hateful
match
.
<EOS>
It
be
inconceivable
that
a
youth
of
twenty
-
three
,
and
such
a
youth
as
Frank
,
should
be
obstinately
constant
to
a
girl
possess
of
no
great
beauty
 
so
argue
Lady
Arabella
to
herself
 
and
who
have
neither
wealth
,
birth
,
nor
fashion
to
recommend
her
.
  
<EOS>
and
thus
it
be
at
last
settle
 
<EOS>
the
squire
be
a
willing
party
to
the
agreement
 
that
Frank
should
go
up
and
be
badger
in
lieu
of
his
father
.
<EOS>
at
his
age
it
be
possible
to
make
it
appear
a
thing
desirable
,
if
not
necessary
 
on
account
of
the
importance
convey
 
to
sit
day
after
day
in
the
chamber
of
Messrs
Slow
&
Bideawhile
,
and
hear
musty
law
talk
,
and
finger
dusty
law
parchment
.
<EOS>
the
squire
have
make
many
visit
to
Messrs
Slow
&
Bideawhile
,
and
he
know
better
.
<EOS>
Frank
have
not
hitherto
be
there
on
his
own
bottom
,
and
thus
he
fall
easily
into
the
trap
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Oriel
be
also
go
to
London
,
and
this
be
another
reason
for
send
Frank
.
<EOS>
Mr
Oriel
have
business
of
great
importance
,
which
it
be
quite
necessary
that
he
should
execute
before
his
marriage
.
<EOS>
how
much
of
this
business
consist
in
go
to
his
tailor
,
buy
a
wedding
-
ring
,
and
purchase
some
other
more
costly
present
for
Beatrice
,
we
need
not
here
inquire
.
<EOS>
but
Mr
Oriel
be
quite
on
Lady
Arabella
's
side
with
reference
to
this
mad
engagement
,
and
as
Frank
<EOS>
and
he
be
now
fast
friend
,
some
good
may
be
do
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
if
we
all
caution
him
against
it
,
he
can
hardly
withstand
us
all
!
"
say
Lady
Arabella
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
the
matter
be
broach
to
Frank
on
the
Saturday
evening
,
and
settle
between
them
all
the
same
night
.
<EOS>
nothing
,
of
course
,
be
at
that
moment
say
about
Mary
;
but
Lady
Arabella
be
too
full
of
the
subject
to
let
him
go
to
London
without
tell
him
that
Mary
be
ready
to
recede
if
only
he
would
allow
her
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
about
eleven
o'clock
,
Frank
be
sit
in
his
own
room
,
con
over
the
difficulty
of
the
situation
 
thinking
of
his
father
's
trouble
,
and
his
own
position
 
when
he
be
rouse
from
his
reverie
by
a
slight
tap
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
in
,
"
say
he
,
somewhat
loudly
.
<EOS>
He
think
it
be
one
of
his
sister
,
who
be
apt
to
visit
him
at
all
hour
and
for
all
manner
of
reason
;
and
he
,
though
he
be
usually
gentle
to
them
,
be
not
at
present
exactly
in
a
humour
to
be
disturb
.
  
<EOS>
the
door
gently
open
,
and
he
see
his
mother
stand
hesitating
in
the
passage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
I
come
in
,
Frank
?
"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
mother
;
by
all
mean
:
"
and
then
,
with
some
surprise
mark
in
his
countenance
,
he
prepare
a
seat
for
her
.
<EOS>
such
a
visit
as
this
from
Lady
Arabella
be
very
unusual
;
so
much
so
,
that
he
have
probably
not
see
her
in
his
own
room
since
the
day
when
he
first
leave
school
.
<EOS>
He
have
nothing
,
however
,
to
be
ashamed
of
;
nothing
to
conceal
,
unless
it
be
an
open
letter
from
Miss
Dunstable
which
he
have
in
his
hand
when
she
enter
,
and
which

to
say
a
few
word

you

for
London
about
this
business

Frank
signify
by
a
gesture
,
that
he
be
quite
ready
to
listen
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
to
see
your
father
put
the
matter
into
your
hand

You
be
young
than
he

then
 
I
do

somehow
your

be
unfortunate

certainly

ah
me
!
<EOS>
I
little
think
when
I
marry

I
do
not

to
complain

have
excellent

that

to
fear

come
when

in
that
strain

I
will
do
the
good
I
can

he

up
in
town

can
not

think
myself

do
as
well

"
  
"
oh
,
dear
<EOS>
no

by
no

in
such

himself

it

right

know
how

stand

who
be
so
much
interested

you
be

<EOS>
Poor
Frank

I
so
often
feel
for
you
when
I
think
how
the
property
have
dwindle

<EOS>

do
not

me

why
should
you
talk
of
it
as
my
matter

forty

five

His
life

so
to
speak
,
be
as
good
as
mine

I
can
do
very
well

all
I
want

to
be
allow
to
settle
to
something

a

something

They
be
so
slow

dear
Frank

<EOS>
You
,
who
speak
French
<EOS>
so
well

I
should
think
my
brother

get
you
in

would

well

you
will
hear
me

<EOS>
Frank
's
brow
again
grow
black
,
for
he
know
that
his
mother
be
about
to
say
something
which
it
would
be
disagreeable
for
him
to
hear

Frank

you
can
not
but
know
that
the
fate
of
an
only
son
must
be
a
subject
of
anxiety
to
a
mother
.
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
how
singularly
alter
be
Lady
Arabella
's
tone
since
first
she
have
take
upon
herself
to
discuss
the
marriage
prospect
of
her
son
!
<EOS>
then
how
autocratic
have
she
be
as
she
send
him
away
,
bid
him
,
with
full
command
,
to
throw
himself
into
the
golden
embrace
of
Miss
Dunstable
!
<EOS>
but
now
,
how
humble
,
as
she
come
suppliantly
to
his
room
,
crave
that
she
may
have
leave
to
whisper
into
his
ear
a
mother
's
anxious
fear
!
<EOS>
Frank
have
laugh
at
her
stern
behest
,
though
he
have
half
obey
them
;
but
he
be
touch
to
the
heart
by
her
humility
.
  
<EOS>
He
draw
his
chair
nearer
to
her
,
and
take
her
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
but
she
,
disengage
her
,
part
the
hair
from
off
his
forehead
,
and
kiss
his
brow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Frank
,
"
she
say
,
"
I
have
be
so
proud
of
you

proud

will
send

to
my

"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Frank
;
I
will
not
 
no
<EOS>
,
I
will
not
;
not
another
word
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
Frank
 
"
  
before
we
go
on
we
must
say
one
word
further
as
to
Lady
Arabella
's
character
.
<EOS>
It
will
probably
be
say
that
she
be
a
consummate
hypocrite
;
but
at
the
present
moment
she
be
not
hypocritical
.
<EOS>
She
do
love
her
son
;
be
anxious
 
very
,
very
anxious
for
him
;
be
proud
of
him
,
and
almost
admire
the
very
obstinacy
which
so
vex
her
to
her
inmost
soul
.
<EOS>
no
grief
would
be
to
her
so
great
as
that
of
see
him
sink
below
what
she
conceive
to
be
his
position
.
<EOS>
She
be
as
genuinely
motherly
,
in
wish
that
he
should
marry
money
,
as
another
woman
may
be
in
wish
to
see
her
son
a
bishop
;
or
as
the
Spartan
matron
,
who
prefer
that
her
offspring
should
return
on
his
shield
,
to
hear
that
he
have
come
back
whole
in
limb
but
taint
in
honour
.
<EOS>
when
Frank
speak
of
a
profession
,
she
instantly
think
of
what
Lord
de
Courcy
may
do
for
him
.
<EOS>
if
he
would
not
marry
money
,
he
may
,
at
any
rate
,
be
an
attaché
at
an
embassy
.
<EOS>
a
profession
 
hard
work
,
as
a
doctor
,
or
as
an
engineer
 
<EOS>
would
,
accord
to
her
idea
,
degrade
him
;
cause
him
to
sink
below
his
proper
position
;
but
to
dangle
at
a
foreign
court
,
to
make
small
talk
at
the
evening
party
of
a
lady
ambassadress
,
and
occasionally
,
perhaps
,
to
write
demi
-
official
note
contain
demi
-
official
tittle
-
tattle
;
this
would
be
in
proper
accordance
with
the
high
honour
of
a
Gresham
of
Greshamsbury
.
  
<EOS>
We
may
not
admire
the
direction
take
by
Lady
Arabella
's
energy
on
behalf
of
her
son
,
but
that
energy
be
not
hypocritical
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
Frank
 
"
She
look
wistfully
into
his
face
as
she
address
him
,
as
though
half
afraid
to
go
on
,
and
beg
that
he
would
receive
with
complaisance
<EOS>
whatever
she
find
herself
force
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
well

I

with
Mary

yesterday

"
<EOS>

what
then

I
know
what
your

<EOS>
"
no

Frank
;
you
wrong
me

<EOS>
I
have
no
feeling
against
her
 
none
,
indeed
;
none
but
this
:
that
she
be
not
fit
to
be
your
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
her
fit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
yes
;
but
how
fit
?
<EOS>
think
of
your
position
,
Frank
,
and
what
mean
you
have
of
keep
her
.
<EOS>
think
what
you
be
.
<EOS>
Your
father
's
only
son
;
the
heir
to
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
if
Greshamsbury
be
ever
again
more
than
a
name
,
it
be
you
that
must
redeem
it

of
all

you
be
the
least
able
to
marry
a
girl
like
Mary
Thorne

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
mother
,
I
will
not

myself
for
what
you
call
my
position

who
ask
you

<EOS>
I
do
not

nobody
ask
you

<EOS>
I
do
not

you

I
do
think
once

that
pass

You

twenty

three

still
be

only
ask
you
to
wait

you
marry
now
,
that
is
,
marry
such
a
girl
as
Mary
Thorne

"
such
a
girl
!
<EOS>
where
shall
I
find
such
another
?

I
mean
as
regard

you
know
I

that

how
be
you

where
be
you

go

then

her
birth

birth
!

I
hate
such
pretence

what
be

I
will
not
talk
about
it

mother
,
I
tell
you
my
word
be
pledge
,
and
on
no
account
will
I
be
induce
to
break
it

"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
that
be
just
it
;
that
be
just
the
point
.
<EOS>
now
,
Frank
,
listen
to
me

<EOS>
pray
listen
to
me
patiently
for
one
minute

of
you

<EOS>
Frank
promise
that
he
would
listen
patiently
;
but
he
look
anything
but
patient
as
he
say
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
Mary

as
it
be
certainly
my
duty
to
do

can

that
I

have
see
her

I
must
own

that

to
be
courteous
to
me
,
personally
,
she
say
much
that
mark
her
excellent
good
sense
.
<EOS>
but
the
gist
of
it
be
this
;
that
as
she
have
make
you
a
promise
,
nothing
should
turn
her
from
that
promise

your
permission
.

"
and
do
you
think
 
"
  
"
wait
a
moment
,
Frank
,
and
listen
to
me

She
confess
that
this
marriage
be
one
which
would
necessarily
bring
distress
on
all
your
family
;
that
it
be
one
which
would
probably
be
ruinous
to
yourself
;
that
it
be
a
match
which
could
not
be
approve
of
:
she
do
,
indeed
;
she
confess
all
that
.

I
have
nothing

not
a
reason

a
law

would
you
have
me
desert
such
a

It
be
not
desert

<EOS>
Frank
:
it
would
not
be
desert
:
you
would
be
do
that
which
she
herself
approve
of
.
<EOS>
She
feel
the
impropriety
of
go
on
;
but
she
can
not
draw
back
because
of
her
promise
to
you
.
<EOS>
She
think
that
she
can
not
do
it
,
even
though
she
wish
it

wish
it
!
<EOS>
oh
,
mother
!
<EOS>

I
do
believe
she
do

she
have
sense
to
feel
the
truth
of
all
that
your

say

oh
,
Frank

I
will
go
on
my

mother

mother
!

mother

You
should
think
twice
,
Frank
,
before
you
refuse
the
only
request
your
mother
ever
make
you
.
<EOS>

why
do
I
ask
you

I
come

you
thus

it

my
darling
boy

you
lose
everything

love
the

you
have
play
as

whose
fault
be
it

we
be
together
as
child

be
now
more
than
a

I
look
on
her
already
as
my
wife

she
be
not
your
wife
,
Frank
;
and
she
know
that
she
ought
not
to
be

It
be
only
because
you
hold
her
to
it
that
she
consent
to
be
so
.
<EOS>

"
do
you
mean
to
say
that
she
do
not
love
me

"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
would
probably
have
say
this
,
also
,
have
she
dare
;
but
she
feel
,
that
in
do
so
,
she
would
be
go
too
far
.
<EOS>
It
be
useless
for
her
to
say
anything
that
would
be
utterly
contradict
by
an
appeal
to
Mary
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Frank
;
I
do
not
mean
to
say
that
you
do
not
love
her

<EOS>
what
I
do
mean
be
this
:
that
it
be
not
become
in
you
to
give
up
everything
 
not
only
yourself
,
but
all
your
family
 
for
such
a
love
as
this
;
and
that
she
,
Mary
herself
,
acknowledge
this
.
<EOS>
every
one
be
of
the
same
opinion
.
<EOS>
ask
your
father
:
I
need
not
say
that
he
would
agree
with
you
about
everything
if
he
could
.

I
will
not
say
the
de
Courcys

oh
,
the
de
Courcys
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
they
be
my
relation
;
I
know
that

<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
could
not
quite
drop
the
tone
of
bitterness
which
be
natural
to
her
in
say
this
.
"
<EOS>
but
ask
your
sister
;
ask
Mr
Oriel
,
whom
you
esteem
so
much
;
ask
your
friend
Harry
Baker
.

Frank
sit
silent
for

two

with

look
almost
of
agony

gaze
into
his
face

no

myself

sacrifice
all
to
such
a

all

you
say
that
you
so
love
?
<EOS>
what
happiness
can
you
give
her
as
your
wife
?
<EOS>
oh
,
Frank
!
<EOS>
be
that
the
only
answer
you
will
make
your
mother
on
her
knee
?
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
mother
!
<EOS>
mother
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Frank
,
I
will
not
let
you
ruin
yourself
;
I
will
not
let
you
destroy
yourself
.
<EOS>
promise
this
,
at
least
,
that
you
will
think
of
what
I
have
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
think
of
it
!
<EOS>
I
do
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
but
think
of
it
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
absent
now
in
London
;
you
will
have
the
business
of
the
estate
to
manage
;
you
will
have
heavy
care
upon
your
hand
.
<EOS>
think
of
it
as
a
man
,
and
not
as
a
boy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
see
her
to
-
morrow
before
I
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Frank
,
no
;
grant
me
that
trifle
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
think
upon
this
without
see
her
.
<EOS>
do
not
proclaim
yourself
so
weak
that
you
can
not
trust
yourself
to
think
over
what
your
mother
say
to
you
without
ask
her
leave
.
<EOS>
though
you
be
in
love
,
do
not
be
childish
with
it
.
<EOS>
what
I
have
tell
you
as
come
from
her
be
true
,
word
for
word
;
if
it
be
not
,
you
would
soon
learn
so
.
<EOS>
think
now
of
what
I
have
say
,
and
of
what
she
say
,
and
when
you
come
back
from
London
,
then
you
can
decide
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
to
so
much
Frank
consent
after
some
further
parley
;
namely
,
that
he
would
proceed
to
London
on
the
follow
Monday
morning
without
again
see
Mary
.
<EOS>
and
in
the
meantime
,
she
be
wait
with
sore
heart
for
his
answer
to
that
letter
that
be
lie
,
and
be
still
to
lie
for
so
many
hour
,
in
the
safe
protection
of
the
Silverbridge
postmistress
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
seem
strange
;
but
,
in
truth
,
his
mother
's
eloquence
have
more
effect
on
Frank
than
that
of
his
father
:
and
yet
,
with
his
father
he
have
always
sympathise
.
<EOS>
but
his
mother
have
be
energetic
;
whereas
,
his
father
,
if
not
lukewarm
,
have
,
at
any
rate
,
be
timid
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
ask
no
one
,
"
Frank
have
say
in
the
strong
determination
of
his
heart
;
and
yet
the
word
be
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
before
he
bethink
himself
that
he
would
talk
the
thing
over
with
Harry
Baker
.
<EOS>
"
not
,
"
say
he
to
himself
,
"
that
I
have
any
doubt
;
I
have
no
doubt
;
but
I
hate
to
have
all
the
world
against
me
.
<EOS>
My
mother
wish
me
to
ask
Harry
Baker
.
<EOS>
Harry
be
a
good
fellow
,
and
I
will
ask
him
.
"
<EOS>
and
with
this
resolve
he
betake
himself
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
the
follow
day
be
Sunday
.
<EOS>
after
breakfast
Frank
go
with
the
family
to
church
,
as
be
usual
;
and
there
,
as
usual
,
he
see
Mary
in
Dr
Thorne
's
pew
.
<EOS>
She
,
as
she
look
at
him
,
could
not
but
wonder
why
he
have
not
answer
the
letter
which
be
still
at
Silverbridge
;
and
he
endeavour
to
read
in
her
face
whether
it
be
true
,
as
his
mother
have
tell
him
,
that
she
be
quite
ready
to
give
him
up
.
<EOS>
the
prayer
of
both
of
them
be
disturb
,
as
be
so
often
the
case
with
the
prayer
of
other
anxious
people
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
separate
door
open
from
the
Greshamsbury
pew
out
into
the
Greshamsbury
ground
,
so
that
the
family
be
not
force
into
unseemly
community
with
the
village
multitude
in
go
to
and
from
their
prayer
;
for
the
front
door
of
the
church
lead
out
into
a
road
which
have
no
connexion
with
the
private
path
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
unusual
with
Frank
and
his
father
to
go
round
,
after
the
service
,
to
the
chief
entrance
,
so
that
they
may
speak
to
their
neighbour
,
and
get
rid
of
some
of
the
exclusiveness
which
be
intend
for
them
.
<EOS>
on
this
morning
the
squire
do
so
;
but
Frank
walk
home
with
his
mother
and
sister
,
so
that
Mary
see
no
more
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
say
that
he
walk
home
with
his
mother
and
his
sister
;
but
he
rather
follow
in
their
path
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
incline
to
talk
much
,
at
least
,
not
to
them
;
and
he
continue
ask
himself
the
question
 
whether
it
could
be
possible
that
he
be
wrong
in
remain
true
to
his
promise
?
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
he
owe
more
to
his
father
and
his
mother
,
and
what
they
choose
to
call
his
position
,
than
he
do
to
Mary
?
  
<EOS>
after
church
,
Mr
Gazebee
try
to
get
hold
of
him
,
for
there
be
much
still
to
be
say
,
and
many
hint
to
be
give
,
as
to
how
Frank
should
speak
,
and
,
more
especially
,
as
to
how
he
should
hold
his
tongue
among
the
learn
pundit
in
and
about
Chancery
Lane
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
very
wide
awake
with
Messrs
Slow
&
Bideawhile
,
"
say
Mr
Gazebee
.
<EOS>
but
Frank
would
not
hearken
to
him
just
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
ride
over
to
Harry
Baker
,
so
he
put
Mr
Gazebee
off
till
the
half
-
hour
before
dinner
,
 
or
else
the
half
-
hour
after
tea
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
previous
day
he
have
receive
a
letter
from
Miss
Dunstable
,
which
he
have
hitherto
read
but
once
.
<EOS>
His
mother
have
interrupt
him
as
he
be
about
to
refer
to
it
;
and
now
,
as
his
father
's
nag
be
be
saddle
 
<EOS>
he
be
still
prudent
in
save
the
black
horse
 
<EOS>
he
again
take
it
out
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Dunstable
have
write
in
an
excellent
humour
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
great
distress
about
the
oil
of
Lebanon
,
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
try
to
get
a
purchaser
for
the
last
two
year
;
but
my
lawyer
will
not
let
me
sell
it
,
because
the
would
-
be
purchaser
offer
a
thousand
pound
or
so
less
than
the
value
.
<EOS>
I
would
give
ten
to
be
rid
of
the
bore
;
but
I
be
as
little
able
to
act
myself
as
Sancho
be
in
his
government

<EOS>
the
oil
of
Lebanon
!
<EOS>
do
you
hear
anything
of
it
when
you
be
in
those
part
?
<EOS>
I
think
of
change
the
name
to
"
London
particular
;
"
but
my
lawyer
say
the
brewer
would
bring
an
action
against
me

<EOS>
"
I
be
go
down
to
your
neighbourhood
 
to
your

I
be
prevent
by
my
poor
doctor
,
who
be
so
weak
that
I
must
take
him
to
Malvern
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
bore
;
but
I
have
the
satisfaction
that
I
do
my
duty
by
him

<EOS>
"
Your
cousin
George

to
be

so
I

at

not
well

be
so
delighted

I
do
so
regret
it

<EOS>
"
Mr
Moffat
have
turn
up
again

We
all

finally

leave
a
card
the
other
day

I
have
tell
the
servant
always
to
say
that
I

shillelaghs

this
time

by
the
by

I
have
a
_

for

I
will
not
tell
you
what
it
be

permit
you
to
communicate
the
fact

when
you
tell

you
have
nothing
well
to
do
at

do
come

see
my
invalid

perhaps
you
may
have
a
mind

treat
for
the
oil

will
give
you
all
the
assistance

"
  
<EOS>
there
be
not
much
about
Mary
in
this
;
but
still
,
the
little
that
be
say
make
him
again
declare
that
neither
father
nor
mother
should
move
him
from
his
resolution

I
will
write
to
her

I

run
down
to
Malvern
for
a
day

It
will
do
me
good
to
see
her

"
<EOS>
and
so
resolve
,
he
ride
away
to
Mill
Hill
,
think
,
as
he
go
,
how
he
would
put
the
matter
to
Harry
Baker
.
  
<EOS>
Harry
be
at
home
;
but
we
need
not
describe
the
whole
interview
.
<EOS>
have
Frank
be
ask
beforehand
<EOS>
,
he
would
have
declare
,
that
on
no
possible
subject
could
he
have
have
the
slight
hesitation
in
ask
Harry
any
question
,
or
communicate
to
him
any
tiding
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
time
come
,
he
find
that
he
do
hesitate
much
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
want
to
ask
his
friend
if
he
should
be
wise
to
marry
Mary
Thorne
.
<EOS>
wise
or
not
,
he
be
determined
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
but
he
wish
to
be
quite
sure
that
his
mother
be
wrong
in
say
that
all
the
world
would
dissuade
him
from
it
.
<EOS>
Miss
Dunstable
,
at
any
rate
,
do
not
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
seat
on
a
stile
at
the
back
of
the
Mill
Hill
stable
,
while
Harry
stand
close
before
him
with
both
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
he
do
get
his
story
tell
.
<EOS>
It
be
by
no
means
the
first
time
that
Harry
Baker
have
hear
about
Mary
Thorne
,
and
he
be
not
,
therefore
,
so
surprised
as
he
may
have
be
,
have
the
affair
be
new
to
him
.
<EOS>
and
thus
,
stand
there
in
the
position
we
have
describe
,
do
Mr
Baker
,
junior
,
give
utterance
to
such
wisdom
as
be
in
him
on
this
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Frank
,
there
be
two
side
to
every
question
;
and
,
as
I
take
it
,
fellow
be
so
apt
to
go
wrong
because
they
be
so
fond
of
one
side
,
they
will
not
look
at
the
other
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
about
it
,
Lady
Arabella
be
a
very
clever
woman
,
and
know
what
be
what
;
and
there
be
no
doubt
about
this
either
,
that
you
have
a
very
ticklish
hand
of
card
to
play
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
play
it
straightforward
;
that
be
my
game

Frank

<EOS>
"
well
and
good
,
<EOS>
my
dear
fellow

be
the
good
game
always

but
what
be
straightforward
?
<EOS>
between
you
and
me
,
I
fear
there
be
no
doubt
that
your
father
's
property
have
get
into
a
deuce
of
a
mess
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

that
that
have
anything
to
do
with
it

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
but
it
have
.
<EOS>
if
the
estate
be
all
right
,
and
your
father
could
give
you
a
thousand
a
year
to
live
on
without
feel
it
,
and
if
your
eld
child
would
be
cock
-
sure
of
Greshamsbury
,
it
may
be
very
well
that
you
should
please
yourself
as
to
marry
at
once
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
not
the
case
;
and
yet
Greshamsbury
be
too
good
a
card
to
be
fling
away
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
I
could
fling
it
away
to
-
morrow

Frank

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
you
think
so
,
"
say
Harry
the
Wise
.
<EOS>
"
but
if
you
be
to
hear
to

morrow
that
Sir
Louis
Scatcherd
be
master
of
the
whole
place

and
be
d

to
him

you
would
feel
very
uncomfortable

<EOS>
have
Harry
know
how
near
Sir
Louis
be
to
his
last
struggle
,
he
would
not
have
speak
of
him
in
this
manner

that
be
all
very
fine
talk

it
will
not
bear
wear

tear

You
do
care
for
Greshamsbury

if
you
be
the
fellow
I
take
you
to
be

care
for
it
very
much

you
care
too
for
your
father

Gresham
of
Greshamsbury

<EOS>
"
this
will
not
affect
my
father
at
all

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
but
it
will
affect
him
very
much
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
to
marry
Miss
Thorne
to

morrow

there
would
at
once
be
an
end
to
any

the

and
do
you
mean
to
say
I
be
to
be
a
liar
to
her
for
such
reason
as
that
?
<EOS>
why
,
Harry
,
I
should
be
as
bad
as
Moffat
.
<EOS>
only
it
would
be
ten
time
more
cowardly
,
as
she
have
no
brother

<EOS>
"
I
must
differ
from
you
there
altogether

mind
,
I
do
not
mean
to
say
anything

<EOS>
tell
me
that
you
have
make
up
your

to
marry
her

I
will
stick
to
you
through
thick

thin

if
you
ask
my
advice

why
,
I
must
give
it

<EOS>
It
be
quite
a
different
affair
to
that
of

He
have
lot
of
tin

everything
he
could

there
could
be
no

he
should
not

that
he
be
a
snob

of
whom
your
sister
be
well
quit

this
be
very
different

if
I
,
as
your
friend

be
to
put
it
to

do
you

herself

"
She
would
say
whatever
she
think
best
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
exactly
:
because
she
be
a
trump
.
<EOS>
and
I
say
the
same
.
<EOS>
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it
,
Frank
,
my
boy
:
such
a
marriage
would
be
very
foolish
for
you
both
;
very
foolish
.
<EOS>
nobody
can
admire
Miss
Thorne
more
than
I
do
;
but
you
ought
not
to
be
a
marry
man
for
the
next
ten
year
,
unless
you
get
a
fortune
.
<EOS>
if
you
tell
her
the
truth
,
and
if
she
be
the
girl
I
take
her
to
be
,
she
will
not
accuse
you
of
be
false
.
<EOS>
She
will
peak
for
a
while
;
and
so
will
you
,
old
chap
.
<EOS>
but
other
have
have
to
do
that
before
you
.
<EOS>
They
have
get
over
it
,
and
so
will
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
spoken
wisdom
of
Harry
Baker
,
and
who
can
say
that
he
be
wrong
?
<EOS>
Frank
sit
a
while
on
his
rustle
seat
,
pare
his
nail
with
his
penknife
,
and
then
look
up
,
he
thus
thank
his
friend
:
    
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
you
mean
<EOS>
well
,
Harry
;
and
I
be
much
oblige
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
be
right
too
.
<EOS>
but
,
somehow
,
it
do
not
come
home
to
me
.
<EOS>
and
what
be
more
,
after
what
have
pass
,
I
could
not
tell
her
that
I
wish
to
part
from
her
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
and
besides
,
I
have
that
sort
of
feeling
,
that
if
I
hear
she
be
to
marry
any
one
else
,
I
be
sure
I
should
blow
his
brain
out
.
<EOS>
either
his
or
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Frank
,
you
may
count
on
me
for
anything
,
except
the
last
proposition
:
"
and
so
they
shake
hand
,
and
Frank
ride
back
to
Greshamsbury
.
   
<EOS>
Law
Business
in
London
 
<EOS>
on
the
Monday
morning
at
six
o'clock
,
Mr
Oriel
and
Frank
start
together
;
but
early
as
it
be
,
Beatrice
be
up
to
give
them
a
cup
of
coffee
,
Mr
Oriel
have
sleep
that
night
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
whether
Frank
would
have
receive
his
coffee
from
his
sister
's
fair
hand
<EOS>
have
not
Mr
Oriel
be
there
,
may
be
doubt
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
loudly
assert
that
he
should
not
have
do
so
,
when
she
lay
claim
to
great
merit
for
rise
in
his
behalf
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Oriel
have
be
specially
instigate
by
Lady
Arabella
to
use
the
opportunity
of
their
joint
journey
,
for
point
out
to
Frank
the
iniquity
as
well
as
madness
of
the
course
he
be
pursue
;
and
he
have
promise
to
obey
her
ladyship
's
behest
.
<EOS>
but
Mr
Oriel
be
perhaps
not
an
enterprising
man
,
and
be
certainly
not
a
presumptuous
one
.
<EOS>
He
do
intend
to
do
as
he
be
bid
;
but
when
he
begin
,
with
the
object
of
lead
up
to
the
subject
of
Frank
's
engagement
,
he
always
soften
down
into
some
much
easy
enthusiasm
in
the
matter
of
his
own
engagement
with
Beatrice
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
that
perspicuous
,
but
not
over
-
sensitive
strength
of
mind
which
have
enable
Harry
Baker
to
express
his
opinion
out
at
once
;
and
boldly
as
he
do
it
,
yet
to
do
so
without
offence
.
  
<EOS>
four
time
before
the
train
arrive
in
London
,
he
make
some
little
attempt
;
but
four
time
he
fail
.
<EOS>
as
the
subject
be
matrimony
,
it
be
his
easy
course
to
begin
about
himself
;
but
he
never
could
get
any
further
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
man
be
ever
more
fortunate
in
a
wife
than
I
shall
be
,
"
he
say
,
with
a
soft
,
euphuistic
self
-
complacency
,
which
would
have
be
silly
<EOS>
have
it
be
adopt
to
any
other
person
than
the
bride
's
brother
.
<EOS>
His
intention
,
however
,
be
very
good
,
for
he
mean
to
show
,
that
in
his
case
marriage
be
prudent
and
wise
,
because
his
case
differ
so
widely
from
that
of
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
an
excellent
good
girl
:
"
he
have
say
it
three
time
before
,
and
be
not
very
energetic
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
and
so
exactly
suited
to
me
;
indeed
,
all
that
I
could
have
dream
of
.
<EOS>
how
very
well
she
look
this
morning
!
<EOS>
some
girl
only
look
well
at
night
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
like
that
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
expect
her
to
look
like
that
always
at
six
o'clock
a.m.
,
"
say
Frank
,
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
young
lady
only
take
that
trouble
on
very
particular
occasion
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
have
come
down
like
that
if
my
father
or
I
have
be
go
alone
.
<EOS>
no
,
and
she
will
not
do
so
for
you
in
a
couple
of
year
"
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
but
she
be
always
nice
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
her
at
home
as
much
almost
as
you
could
do
;
and
then
she
be
so
sincerely
religious
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
of
course
;
that
is
,
I
be
sure
she
be
,
"
say
Frank
,
look
solemn
as
become
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
make
to
be
a
clergyman
's
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
so
it
seem
,
"
say
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
married
life
be
,
I
be
sure
,
the
happy
in
the
world
 
<EOS>
if
people
be
only
in
a
position
to
marry
,
"
say
Mr
Oriel
,
gradually
draw
near
to
the
accomplishment
of
his
design
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
quite
so
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
Oriel
,
I
never
be
so
sleepy
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
what
with
all
that
fuss
of
Gazebee
's
,
and
one
thing
and
another
,
I
could
not
get
to
bed
till
one
o'clock
;
and
then
I
could
not
sleep
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
a
snooze
now
,
if
you
will
not
think
it
uncivil
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
put
his
foot
upon
the
opposite
seat
,
he
settle
himself
comfortably
to
his
rest
.
<EOS>
and
so
Mr
Oriel
's
last
attempt
for
lecture
Frank
in
the
railway
-
carriage
fade
away
and
be
annihilate
.
  
<EOS>
by
twelve
o'clock
Frank
be
with
Messrs
Slow
&
Bideawhile
.
<EOS>
Mr
Bideawhile
be
engage
at
the
moment
,
but
he
find
the
manage
Chancery
clerk
to
be
a
very
chatty
gentleman
.
<EOS>
judge
from
what
he
see
,
he
would
have
say
that
the
work
to
be
do
at
Messrs
Slow
&
Bideawhile
's
be
not
very
heavy
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
singular
man
that
Sir
Louis
,
"
say
the
Chancery
clerk
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
very
singular
,
"
say
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
excellent
security
,
excellent
;
no
better
;
and
yet
he
will
foreclose
;
but
you
see
he
have
no
power
himself
.
<EOS>
but
the
question
be
,
can
the
trustee
refuse
?
<EOS>
then
,
again
,
trustee
be
so
circumscribed
nowadays
that
they
be
afraid
to
do
anything
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
so
much
say
lately
,
Mr
Gresham
,
that
a
man
do
not
know
where
he
be
,
or
what
he
be
do
.
<EOS>
nobody
trust
anybody
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
such
terrible
thing
that
we
can
not
wonder
at
it
.
<EOS>
only
think
of
the
case
of
those
Hills
!
<EOS>
how
can
any
one
expect
that
any
one
else
will
ever
trust
a
lawyer
again
after
that
?
<EOS>
but
that
be
Mr
Bideawhile
's
bell
.
<EOS>
how
can
any
one
expect
it
?
<EOS>
He
will
see
you
now
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
Mr
Gresham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
it
turn
out
,
and
Frank
be
usher
into
the
presence
of
Mr
Bideawhile
.
<EOS>
He
have
get
his
lesson
by
heart
,
and
be
go
to
rush
into
the
middle
of
his
subject
;
such
a
course
,
however
,
be
not
in
accordance
with
Mr
Bideawhile
's
usual
practice
.
<EOS>
Mr
Bideawhile
get
up
from
his
large
wooden
-
seat
Windsor
chair
,
and
,
with
a
soft
smile
,
in
which
,
however
,
be
mingle
some
slight
dash
of
the
attorney
's
acuteness
,
put
out
his
hand
to
his
young
client
;
not
,
indeed
,
as
though
he
be
go
to
shake
hand
with
him
,
but
as
though
the
hand
be
some
ripe
fruit
all
but
fall
,
which
his
visitor
may
take
and
pluck
if
he
think
proper
.
<EOS>
Frank
take
hold
of
the
hand
,
which
return
him
no
pressure
,
and
then
let
it
go
again
,
not
make
any
attempt
to
gather
the
fruit
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
up
to
town
,
Mr
Bideawhile
,
about
this
mortgage
,
"
commence
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
mortgage
 
ah
,
sit
down
,
Mr
Gresham

sit
down

I
hope
your
father

quite
well

<EOS>
"
quite
well

you

I
have
a
great
regard
for
your
father

so
I
have
for
your
grandfather

a
very
good
man
indeed

<EOS>
You
,
perhaps
,
do
not
remember
him
,
Mr
Gresham

"
  
<EOS>
"
He
die
when
I
be
only
a
year
old

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
;
no
,
you
of
course
,
can
not
remember
him
;
but
I
do
,
well
:
he
use
to
be
very
fond
of
some
port
wine
I
have
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
be

;
"
and
if
I
do
not
mistake
,
I
have
a
bottle
or
two
of
it
yet
;
but
it
be
not
worth
drink
now
.
<EOS>
port
wine
,
you
know
,
will
not
keep
beyond
a
certain
time

that
be
very
good
wine
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
exactly
remember
what
it
stand
me
a
dozen
then
;
but
such
wine
can
not
be
have
now
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
Madeira
,
you
know
there
be
an
end
of
that
.
<EOS>
do
you
drink
Madeira
,
Mr

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

Frank
,
"
not
very
often

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
for
that
,
for
it
be
a
fine
wine
;
but
then
there
be
none
of
it
leave
,
you
know

<EOS>
I
have
a
few
dozen
,
I
be
tell
they
be
grow
pumpkin
where
the
vineyard
be

<EOS>
I
wonder
what
they
do
with
all
the
pumpkin
they
grow
in
Switzerland
!
<EOS>
You
have
be
in
Switzerland
,
Mr
Gresham
?
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
say
he
have
be
in
Switzerland
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
beautiful
country
;
my
girl
make
me
go
there
last
year
.
<EOS>
They
say
it
would
do
me
good
;
but
then
you
know
,
they
want
to
see
it
themselves
;
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
however
,
I
believe
I
shall
go
again
this
autumn
.
<EOS>
that
be
to
Aix
,
or
some
of
those
place
;
just
for
three
week
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
spare
any
more
time
,
Mr
Gresham

<EOS>
do
you
like
that
dining
at
the
_
table
d'hôte

?
"
  
"
<EOS>
pretty
well
,
sometimes
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
one
would
get
tired
of
it
 
eh
!
<EOS>
but
they
give
us
capital
dinner
at
Zurich
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
much
of
their
soup
.
<EOS>
but
they
have
fish
,
and
about
seven
kind
of
meat
and
poultry
,
and
three
or
four
pudding
,
and
thing
of
that
sort

<EOS>
upon
my
word

I
think
we
do
very
well

so
do
my

too

You
see
a
great
many
lady
travel
now

"
a
great
many

upon
my
word

I
think
they
be
right

that
is

can
afford
time

<EOS>
I
can
not
afford
time
.
<EOS>
I
be
here
every
day
till
five
,
Mr
Gresham
;
then
I
go
out
and
dine
in
Fleet
Street
,

then
back
to
work
till
nine

yes
it

hard
work

My

do
not

I
manage
it
somehow

<EOS>
I
get
down
to
my
little
place

I
shall
be
most
happy
to
see
you
there
next
Saturday

<EOS>
Frank
,
think
it
would
be
outrageous
on
his
part
to
take
up
much
of
the
time
of
the
gentleman
who
be
constrain
to
work
so
unreasonably
hard
,
begin
again
to
talk
about
his
mortgage
,
and
,
in
so
do
,
have
to
mention
the
name
of
Mr
Yates
Umbleby
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
poor
Umbleby
!
"
say
Mr
Bideawhile
;
"
what
be
he
do
now
?
<EOS>
I
be
quite
sure
your
father
be
right
,
or
he
would
not
have
do
it
;
but
I
use
to
think
that
Umbleby
be
a
decent
sort
of
man
enough

<EOS>
not
so
grand
,
you
know

as
your
Gazebees

Mr

<EOS>
They
do
say
young
Gazebee
be
think
of
get
into
Parliament

<EOS>
let
me
see
<EOS>
:
Umbleby
married
 
who
be
it
<EOS>
he
marry
?
<EOS>
that
be
the
way
your
father
get
hold
of
him
;
not
your
father

your
grandfather

<EOS>
I
use
to
know
all
about
it

<EOS>
well

I
be
sorry
for
Umbleby

He
have
get
something

I
suppose

<EOS>
Frank
say
that
he
believe
Mr

Umbleby
have
something
wherewith
to
keep
the

so
you
have
get

,
Mr
Bideawhile
.
"
  
"
well
,
about
Sir
Louis
;
a
very
bad
sort
of
fellow
,
be
not
he
?
<EOS>
drink
 
eh
?
<EOS>
I
know
his
father
a
little
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
rough
diamond
,
too
.
<EOS>
I
be
once
down
in
Northamptonshire
,
about
some
railway
business
;
let
me
see
;
I
almost
forget
whether
I
be
with
him
,
or
against
him
.
<EOS>
but
I
know
he
make
sixty
thousand
pound
by
one
hour
's
work
;
sixty
thousand
pound
!
<EOS>
and
then
he
get
so
mad
with
drink
that
we
all
think
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
Mr
Bideawhile
go
on
for
two
hour
,
and
Frank
find
no
opportunity
of
say
one
word
about
the
business
which
have
bring
him
up
to
town
.
<EOS>
what
wonder
that
such
a
man
as
this
should
be
oblige
to
stay
at
his
office
every
night
till
nine
o'clock
?
  
<EOS>
during
these
two
hour
,
a
clerk
have
come
in
three
or
four
time
,
whisper
something
to
the
lawyer
,
who
,
on
the
last
of
such
occasion
,
turn
to
Frank
,
say
,
"
well
,
perhaps
that
will
do
for
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
manage
to
call
to
-
morrow
,
say
about
two
,
I
will
have
the
whole
thing
look
up
;
or
,
perhaps
Wednesday
or
Thursday
would
suit
you
better
.
"
<EOS>
Frank
,
declare
that
the
morrow
would
suit
him
very
well
,
take
his
departure
,
wonder
much
at
the
manner
in
which
business
be
do
at
the
house
of
Messrs
Slow
&
Bideawhile
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
call
the
next
day
,
the
office
seem
to
be
rather
disturb
,
and
he
be
show
quickly
into
Mr
Bideawhile
's
room
.
"
<EOS>
have
you
hear
this
?
"
say
that
gentleman
,
put
a
telegram
into
his
hand
.
<EOS>
It
contain
tiding
of
the
death
of
Sir
Louis
Scatcherd
.
<EOS>
Frank
immediately
know
that
these
tiding
must
be
of
importance
to
his
father
;
but
he
have
no
idea
how
vitally
they
concern
his
own
more
immediate
interest
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dr
Thorne
will
be
up
in
town
on
Thursday
evening
after
the
funeral
,
"
say
the
talkative
clerk
.
<EOS>
"
and
nothing
of
course
can
be
do
till
he
come
,
"
say
Mr
Bideawhile
.
<EOS>
and
so
Frank
,
ponder
on
the
mutability
of
human
affair
,
again
take
his
departure
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
do
nothing
now
but
wait
for
Dr
Thorne
's
arrival
,
and
so
he
amuse
himself
in
the
interval
by
run
down
to
Malvern
,
and
treat
with
Miss
Dunstable
in
person
for
the
oil
of
Lebanon
.
<EOS>
He
go
down
on
the
Wednesday
,
and
thus
,
fail
to
receive
,
on
the
Thursday
morning
,
Mary
's
letter
,
which
reach
London
on
that
day
.
<EOS>
He
return
,
however
,
on
the
Friday
,
and
then
get
it
;
and
perhaps
it
be
well
for
Mary
's
happiness
that
he
have
see
Miss
Dunstable
in
the
interval
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
what
your
mother
say
,
"
say
she
,
with
emphasis
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
for
any
Harry
,
whether
it
be
Harry
Baker
,
or
old
Harry
himself
.
<EOS>
You
make
her
a
promise
,
and
you
be
bind
to
keep
it
;
if
not
on
one
day
,
then
on
another
.
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
because
you
can
not
draw
back
yourself
,
get
out
of
it
by
induce
her
to
do
so
!
<EOS>
Aunt
de
Courcy
herself
could
not
improve
upon
that
.
<EOS>
"
fortify
in
this
manner
,
he
return
to
town
on
the
Friday
morning
,
and
then
get
Mary
's
letter
.
<EOS>
Frank
also
get
a
note
from
Dr
Thorne
,
state
that
he
have
take
up
his
temporary
domicile
at
the
Gray
's
Inn
Coffee
-
house
,
so
as
to
be
near
the
lawyer
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
suggest
that
the
modern
english
writer
of
fiction
should
among
them
keep
a
barrister
,
in
order
that
they
may
be
set
right
on
such
legal
point
as
will
arise
in
their
little
narrative
,
and
thus
avoid
that
exposure
of
their
own
ignorance
of
the
law
,
which
,
now
,
alas
!
<EOS>
they
too
often
make
.
<EOS>
the
idea
be
worthy
of
consideration
,
and
I
can
only
say
,
that
if
such
an
arrangement
can
be
make
,
and
if
a
counsellor
adequately
skilful
can
be
find
to
accept
the
office
,
I
shall
be
happy
to
subscribe
my
quota
;
it
would
be
but
a
modest
tribute
towards
the
cost
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
the
suggestion
have
not
yet
be
carry
out
,
and
as
there
be
at
present
no
learned
gentleman
whose
duty
would
induce
him
to
set
me
right
,
I
can
only
plead
for
mercy
<EOS>
if
I
be
wrong
allot
all
Sir
Roger
's
vast
possession
in
perpetuity
to
Miss
Thorne
,
allege
also
,
in
excuse
,
that
the
course
of
my
narrative
absolutely
demand
that
she
shall
be
ultimately
recognise
as
Sir
Roger
's
undoubted
heiress
.
  
<EOS>
such
,
after
a
not
immoderate
delay
,
be
the
opinion
express
to
Dr
Thorne
by
his
law
adviser
;
and
such
,
in
fact
,
turn
out
to
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
I
will
leave
the
matter
so
,
hope
that
my
very
absence
of
defence
may
serve
to
protect
me
from
severe
attack
.
<EOS>
if
under
such
a
will
as
that
describe
as
have
be
make
by
Sir
Roger
,
Mary
would
not
have
be
the
heiress
,
that
will
must
have
be
describe
wrongly
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
quite
at
once
that
those
tiding
make
themselves
absolutely
certain
to
Dr
Thorne
's
mind
;
nor
be
he
able
to
express
any
such
opinion
when
he
first
meet
Frank
in
London
.
<EOS>
at
that
time
Mary
's
letter
be
in
Frank
's
pocket
;
and
Frank
,
though
his
real
business
appertain
much
more
to
the
fact
of
Sir
Louis
's
death
,
and
the
effect
that
would
immediately
have
on
his
father
's
affair
,
be
much
more
full
of
what
so
much
more
nearly
concerned
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
show
it
Dr
Thorne
himself
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
ask
him
what
he
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
be
stretch
fast
asleep
on
the
comfortless
horse
-
hair
sofa
in
the
dingy
sitting
-
room
at
the
Gray
's
Inn
Coffee
-
house
when
Frank
find
him
.
<EOS>
the
funeral
,
and
his
journey
to
London
,
and
the
lawyer
have
together
conquer
his
energy
,
and
he
lie
and
snore
,
with
nose
upright
,
while
heavy
London
summer
fly
settle
on
his
head
and
face
,
and
rob
his
slumber
of
half
their
charm
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
say
he
,
jump
up
as
though
he
have
be
detect
in
some
disgraceful
act
.
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
Frank
,
I
beg
your
pardon
;
but
 
well
,
my
dear
fellow
,
all
well
at
Greshamsbury
 
eh
?
"
and
as
he
shake
himself
,
he
make
a
lunge
at
one
uncommonly
disagreeable
fly
that
have
be
at
him
for
the
last
ten
minute
.
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
he
miss
his
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
be
with
you
before
,
doctor
,
but
I
be
down
at
Malvern
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
at
Malvern
,
eh
?
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
so
Oriel
tell
me
.
<EOS>
the
death
of
poor
Sir
Louis
be
very
sudden
 
<EOS>
be
it
not
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
very
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
poor
fellow
 
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
His
fate
have
for
some
time
be
past
hope
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
madness
,
Frank
;
the
bad
of
madness
.
<EOS>
only
think
of
it
 
father
and
son
!
<EOS>
and
such
a
career
as
the
father
have
 
such
a
career
as
the
son
may
have
have
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
have
be
very
quickly
run
,
"
say
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
it
be
all
forgive
him
!
<EOS>
I
sometimes
can
not
but
believe
in
a
special
Providence
.
<EOS>
that
poor
fellow
be
not
able
,
never
would
have
be
able
,
to
make
proper
use
of
the
mean
which
fortune
have
give
him
.
<EOS>
I
hope
they
may
fall
into
well
hand
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
use
in
deny
it
,
his
death
will
be
an
immense
relief
to
me
,
and
a
relief
also
to
your
father
.
<EOS>
all
this
law
business
will
now
,
of
course
,
be
stop
.
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
I
hope
I
may
never
be
a
trustee
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
have
put
his
hand
four
or
five
time
into
his
breast
-
pocket
,
and
have
as
often
take
out
and
put
back
again
Mary
's
letter
before
he
could
find
himself
able
to
bring
Dr
Thorne
to
the
subject
.
<EOS>
at
last
there
be
a
lull
in
the
purely
legal
discussion
,
cause
by
the
doctor
intimate
that
he
suppose
Frank
would
now
soon
return
to
Greshamsbury
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
shall
go
to
-
morrow
morning

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
so
soon
as
that

I

on
have
you
one
day
in
London

me

<EOS>

no

morrow

I
be
not

company

I
fit

read
that
,
doctor
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
use
put
it
off
any
longer
.
<EOS>
I
must
get
you
to
talk
this
over
with
me
.
<EOS>
just
read
that
,
and
tell
me
what
you
think
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
write
a
week
ago
,
when
I
be
there
,
but
somehow
I
have
only
get
it
to
-
day
.
"
<EOS>
and
put
the
letter
into
the
doctor
's
hand
,
he
turn
away
to
the
window
,
and
look
out
among
the
Holborn
omnibus
.
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
take
the
letter
and
read
it
.
<EOS>
Mary
,
after
she
have
write
it
,
have
bewail
to
herself
that
the
letter
be
cold
;
but
it
have
not
seem
cold
to
her
lover
,
nor
do
it
appear
so
to
her
uncle
.
<EOS>
when
Frank
turn
round
from
the
window
,
the
doctor
's
handkerchief
be
up
to
his
eye
;
who
,
in
order
to
hide
the
tear
that
be
there
,
be
oblige
to
go
through
a
rather
violent
process
of
blow
his
nose
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
he
say
,
as
he
give
back
the
letter
to
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
what
do
<EOS>
well
mean
?
<EOS>
be
it
well
?
<EOS>
or
would
it
be
well
<EOS>
be
he
,
Frank
,
to
comply
with
the
suggestion
make
to
him
by
Mary

<EOS>
"
It
be
impossible

"
he
say

"
that
matter
should
go
on

be
sure

I

the
doctor

it
be
out
of
the
question
that
she
should

will
I
consent

sacrifice
my

happiness

you

I
ought

give
to
that
letter

there
can
be
no
person
so
anxious
for
her
happiness

myself

as
he
ask
the
question
,
he
again
put
into
the
doctor

almost
unconsciously

the
letter

over

over

not

me
take
a

at

manage
a
couple

thousand
pound

so

him

offer

yes

that
could
be
manage

not

immediately

in
six
month

know

I

good

what
answer
I
ought
to

for

I
have
make
up

out
his
different

one
after

on

over
in
his
mind
the
apparent
absurdity
of
Frank

desire
to
borrow
two
thousand
pound
for
a
farm

when

in

he

up

me

against

<EOS>
no

not

will
you
tell
Mary

she
have
your
consent
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
know
that

<EOS>

you
have
never
say
anything
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
look
here
,
Frank
;
you
ask
me
for
my
advice
,
and
I
will
give
it
you
:
go
home
;
though
,
indeed
,
I
would
rather
you
go
anywhere
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
must
go
home
;
and
I
must
see
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
go
home
:
as
for
see
Mary
,
I
think
you
have
better
put
it
off
for
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
quite
impossible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
that
be
my
advice
.
<EOS>
but
,
at
any
rate
,
make
up
your
mind
to
nothing
for
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
wait
for
one
fortnight
,
and
I
then
will
tell
you
plainly
 
you
and
her
too
 
<EOS>
what
I
think
you
ought
to
do
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
come
to
me
,
and
tell
the
squire
that
I
will
take
it
as
a
great
kindness
if
he
will
come
with
you
.
<EOS>
She
have
suffer
,
terribly
,
terribly
;
and
it
be
necessary
that
something
should
be
settle
.
<EOS>
but
a
fortnight
more
can
make
no
great
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
the
letter
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
there
be
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"

what
shall
I
say
?
<EOS>
of
course
I
shall
write
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
tell
her
to
wait
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
and
,
Frank
,
mind
you
bring
your
father
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Frank
could
draw
nothing
further
from
his
friend
save
constant
repetition
of
this
charge
to
him
to
wait
a
fortnight
,
 
just
one
other
fortnight
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
will
come
to
you
at
any
rate

Frank
;

I
will
bring
my

night

<EOS>
on
the
Saturday
morning
,
Mary
,
who
be
then
nearly
break
-
hearted
at
her
lover
's
silence
,
receive
a
short
note
:
    
my
own
MARY
,
  
<EOS>
I
shall
be
home
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
will
by
no
means
release
you
from
your
promise
.
<EOS>
of
course
you
will
perceive
that
I
only
get
your
letter
to
-
day
.
  
<EOS>
Your
own
dearest
,
  
FRANK
.
  
<EOS>
P.S.
 
<EOS>
You
will
have
to
call
me
so
hundred
and
hundred
of
time
yet
.
  
<EOS>
short
as
it
be
,
this
suffice
Mary
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
thing
for
a
young
lady
to
make
prudent
,
heart
-
break
suggestion
,
but
quite
another
to
have
them
accept
.
<EOS>
She
do
call
him
dearest
Frank
,
even
on
that
one
day
,
almost
as
often
as
he
have
desire
her
.
   
<EOS>
Our
Pet
Fox
find
a
tail
 
Frank
return
home
,
and
his
immediate
business
be
of
course
with
his
father
,
and
with
Mr
Gazebee
,
who
be
still
at
Greshamsbury
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
who
be
the
heir
?
"
ask
Mr
Gazebee
,
when
Frank
have
explain
that
the
death
of
Sir
Louis
render
unnecessary
any
immediate
legal
step
.
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
Dr
Thorne
,
"
say
the
squire
.
<EOS>
"
He
must
have
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
think
of
ask
him
,
"
say
Frank
,
naïvely
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Gazebee
look
rather
solemn
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
at
that
,
"
say
he
;
"
for
everything
now
depend
on
the
hand
the
property
will
go
into
.
<EOS>
let
me
see
<EOS>
;
I
think
Sir
Roger
have
a
married
sister
.
<EOS>
be
not
that
so
,
Mr
Gresham
?
"
<EOS>
and
then
it
occur
for
the
first
time
,
both
to
the
squire
and
to
his
son
,
that
Mary
Thorne
be
the
eld
child
of
this
sister
.
<EOS>
but
it
never
occur
to
either
of
them
that
Mary
could
be
the
baronet
's
heir
.
  
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
come
down
for
a
couple
of
day
before
the
fortnight
be
over
to
see
his
patient
,
and
then
return
again
to
London
.
<EOS>
but
during
this
short
visit
he
be
utterly
dumb
on
the
subject
of
the
heir
.
<EOS>
He
call
at
Greshamsbury
to
see
Lady
Arabella
,
and
be
even
question
by
the
squire
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
but
he
obstinately
refuse
to
say
more
than
that
nothing
certain
could
be
know
for
yet
a
few
day
.
  
<EOS>
immediately
after
his
return
,
Frank
see
Mary
,
and
tell
her
all
that
have
happen
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
understand
my
uncle
,
"
say
she
,
almost
tremble
as
she
stand
close
to
him
in
her
own
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
usually
hate
mystery
,
and
yet
now
he
be
so
mysterious
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
Frank
 
<EOS>
that
be
after
I
have
write
that
unfortunate
letter
 
"
  
"
unfortunate
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
you
really
think
of
me
when
you
be
write
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
have
hear
what
your
mother
say
,
you
would
not
be
surprised
.
<EOS>
but
,
after
that
,
uncle
say
 
"
  
"
say
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
seem
to
think
 
I
do
not
remember
what
it
be
he
say
.
<EOS>
but
he
say
,
he
hope
that
thing
may
yet
turn
out
well
;
and
then
I
be
almost
sorry
that
I
have
write
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
be
sorry
,
and
so
you
ought
to
have
be
.
<EOS>
to
say
that
you
would
never
call
me
Frank
again
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
exactly
say
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
tell
him
I
will
wait
a
fortnight
,
and
so
I
will
.
<EOS>
after
that
,
I
shall
take
the
matter
into
my
own
hand
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
well
suppose
that
Lady
Arabella
be
not
well
pleased
to
learn
that
Frank
and
Mary
have
be
again
together
;
and
,
in
the
agony
of
her
spirit
,
she
do
say
some
ill
-
natured
thing
before
Augusta
,
who
have
now
return
from
Courcy
Castle
,
as
to
the
gross
impropriety
of
Mary
's
conduct
.
<EOS>
but
to
Frank
she
say
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
there
much
say
between
Frank
and
Beatrice
.
<EOS>
if
everything
could
really
be
settle
at
the
end
of
that
fortnight
which
be
to
witness
the
disclosure
of
the
doctor
's
mystery
,
there
would
still
be
time
to
arrange
that
Mary
should
be
at
the
wedding
.
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
settle
then
,
"
he
say
to
himself
;
"
and
if
it
be
settle
,
my
mother
will
hardly
venture
to
exclude
my
affiance
bride
from
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
now
the
beginning
of
August
,
and
it
want
yet
a
month
to
the
Oriel
wedding
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
he
say
nothing
to
his
mother
or
to
Beatrice
,
he
do
say
much
to
his
father
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
he
show
him
Mary
's
letter
.
<EOS>
"
if
your
heart
be
not
make
of
stone
it
will
be
soften
by
that
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
Mr
Gresham
's
heart
be
not
of
stone
,
and
he
do
acknowledge
that
the
letter
be
a
very
sweet
letter
.
<EOS>
but
we
know
how
the
drop
of
water
hollow
stone
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
by
the
violence
of
his
appeal
that
Frank
succeed
in
obtain
from
his
father
a
sort
of
half
-
consent
that
he
would
no
longer
oppose
the
match
;
but
by
the
assiduity
with
which
the
appeal
be
repeat
.
<EOS>
Frank
,
as
we
have
say
,
have
more
stubbornness
of
will
than
his
father
;
and
so
,
before
the
fortnight
be
over
,
the
squire
have
be
talk
over
,
and
promise
to
attend
at
the
doctor
's
bidding
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
have
better
take
the
Hazlehurst
farm
,
"
say
he
to
his
son
,
with
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
"
It
join
the
park
and
the
home
-
field
,
and
I
will
give
you
up
them
also
.
<EOS>
God
know
,
I
do
not
care
about
farm
any
more
 
or
about
anything
else
either
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
say
that
,
father
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
well
!
<EOS>
but
,
Frank
,
where
will
you
live
?
<EOS>
the
old
house
be
big
enough
for
us
all
.
<EOS>
but
how
would
Mary
get
on
with
your
mother
?
"
  
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
his
fortnight
,
true
to
his
time
,
the
doctor
return
to
the
village
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
bad
correspondent
;
and
though
he
have
write
some
short
note
to
Mary
,
he
have
say
no
word
to
her
about
his
business
.
<EOS>
It
be
late
in
the
evening
when
he
get
home
,
and
it
be
understand
by
Frank
and
the
squire
that
they
be
to
be
with
him
on
the
following
morning
.
<EOS>
not
a
word
have
be
say
to
Lady
Arabella
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
late
in
the
evening
when
he
get
home
,
and
Mary
wait
for
him
with
a
heart
almost
sick
with
expectation
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
fly
have
stop
at
the
little
gate
she
hear
his
voice
,
and
hear
at
once
that
it
be
quick
,
joyful
,
and
tell
much
of
inward
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
good
-
natured
word
for
Janet
,
and
call
Thomas
an
old
blunder
-
head
in
a
manner
that
make
Bridget
laugh
outright
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
have
his
nose
put
out
of
joint
some
day
;
will
not
he
?
"
say
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
Bridget
blush
and
laugh
again
,
and
make
a
sign
to
Thomas
that
he
have
well
look
to
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
be
in
his
arm
before
he
be
yet
within
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
darling
,
"
say
he
,
tenderly
kiss
her
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
my
own
darling
yet
awhile
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
be
.
<EOS>
be
I
not
always
to
be
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
;
let
me
have
some
tea
,
at
any
rate
,
for
I
be
in
a
fever
of
thirst
.
<EOS>
They
may
call
that
tea
at
the
junction
if
they
will
;
but
if
China
be
sink
under
the
sea
it
would
make
no
difference
to
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
always
be
in
a
fever
of
thirst
when
he
get
home
from
the
railway
,
and
always
make
complaint
as
to
the
tea
at
the
Junction
.
<EOS>
Mary
go
about
her
usual
work
with
almost
more
than
her
usual
alacrity
,
and
so
they
be
soon
seat
in
the
drawing
-
room
together
.
  
<EOS>
She
soon
find
that
his
manner
be
more
than
ordinarily
kind
to
her
;
and
there
be
moreover
something
about
him
which
seem
to
make
him
sparkle
with
contentment
,
but
he
say
no
word
about
Frank
,
nor
do
he
make
any
allusion
to
the
business
which
have
take
him
up
to
town
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
get
through
all
your
work
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
say
to
him
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
;
I
think
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
thoroughly
?
"
  
"
yes
;
thoroughly
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
very
tired
,
and
so
be
you
too
,
darle
,
with
wait
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
I
be
not
,
"
say
she
,
as
she
go
on
continually
fill
his
cup
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
be
so
happy
to
have
you
home
again
.
<EOS>
You
have
be
away
so
much
lately
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
yes
;
well
I
suppose
I
shall
not
go
away
any
more
now
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
somebody
else
's
turn
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Uncle
,
I
think
you
be
go
to
take
up
write
mystery
romance
,
like
Mrs
Radcliffe
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
and
I
will
begin
to
-
morrow
,
certainly
with
 
<EOS>
but
,
Mary
,
I
will
not
say
another
word
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
give
me
a
kiss
,
dear
,
and
I
will
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
do
kiss
him
,
and
he
do
go
.
<EOS>
but
as
she
be
still
linger
in
the
room
,
put
away
a
book
,
or
a
reel
of
thread
,
and
then
sit
down
to
think
what
the
morrow
would
bring
forth
,
the
doctor
again
come
into
the
room
in
his
dressing
-
gown
,
and
with
the
slipper
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
,
not
go
yet
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
not
yet
;
I
be
go
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
and
I
,
Mary
,
have
always
affect
a
good
deal
of
indifference
as
to
money
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
acknowledge
that
it
have
be
an
affectation
at
all
,
"
she
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
not
;
but
we
have
often
express
it
,
have
we
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
uncle
,
you
think
that
we
be
like
the
fox
that
lose
his
tail
,
or
rather
some
unfortunate
fox
that
may
be
bear
without
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
how
we
should
either
of
us
bear
it
if
we
find
ourselves
suddenly
rich
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
great
temptation
 
a
sore
temptation
.
<EOS>
I
fear
,
Mary
,
that
when
poor
people
talk
disdainfully
of
money
,
they
often
be
like
your
fox
,
bear
without
a
tail
.
<EOS>
if
nature
suddenly
should
give
that
beast
a
tail
,
would
he
not
be
prouder
of
it
than
all
the
other
fox
in
the
wood

"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
suppose
he
would
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
very
meaning
of
the
story
.
<EOS>
but
how
moral
you
have
become
all
of
a
sudden
at
twelve
o'clock
at
night
!
<EOS>
instead
of
be
Mrs
Radcliffe
,
I
shall
think
you
be
Mr
Æsop
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
up
the
article
which
he
have
come
to
seek
,
and
kiss
her
again
on
the
forehead
,
go
away
to
his
bed
-
room
without
further
speech
.
<EOS>
"
what
can
he
mean
by
all
this
about
money
?
"
say
Mary
to
herself
.
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
that
by
Sir
Louis
's
death
he
will
get
any
of
all
this
property
;
"
and
then
she
begin
to
bethink
herself
whether
,
after
all
,
she
would
wish
him
to
be
a
rich
man
.
<EOS>
"
if
he
be
very
rich
,
he
may
do
something
to
assist
Frank
;
and
then
 
"
  
there
never
be
a
fox
yet
without
a
tail
who
would
not
be
delighted
to
find
himself
suddenly
possess
of
that
appendage
.
<EOS>
never
;
let
the
untailed
fox
have
be
ever
so
sincere
in
his
advice
to
his
friend
!
<EOS>
We
be
all
of
us
,
the
good
and
the
bad
,
look
for
tail
 
for
one
tail
,
or
for
more
than
one
;
we
do
so
too
often
by
way
that
be
mean
enough
:
but
perhaps
there
be
no
tail
-
seeker
<EOS>
more
mean
,
more
sneakingly
mean
than
he
who
look
out
to
adorn
his
bare
back
with
a
tail
by
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
be
up
very
early
the
next
morning
,
long
before
Mary
be
ready
with
her
teacup
.
<EOS>
He
be
up
,
and
in
his
own
study
behind
the
shop
,
arrange
dingy
paper
,
pull
about
tin
box
which
he
have
bring
down
with
him
from
London
,
and
pile
on
his
writing
-
table
one
set
of
document
in
one
place
,
and
one
in
another
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
understand
it
all
,
"
say
he
;
"
<EOS>
but
yet
I
know
I
shall
be
bother
.
<EOS>
well
,
I
never
will
be
anybody
's
trustee
again
.
<EOS>
let
me
see
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
sit
down
,
and
with
bewilder
look
recapitulate
to
himself
sundry
heavy
item
.
<EOS>
"
what
those
share
be
really
worth
I
can
not
understand
,
and
nobody
seem
able
to
tell
one
.
<EOS>
They
must
make
it
out
among
them
as
best
they
can
.
<EOS>
let
me
see
;
that
be
Boxall
Hill
,
and
this
be
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
I
will
put
a
newspaper
over
Greshamsbury
,

the
squire
will
know
it
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
have
make
his
arrangement
,
he
go
to
his
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
I
be
wrong
,
my
much
and
truly
honoured
critic
,
about
these
title
-
deed
and
document
.
<EOS>
but
when
we
have
get
that
barrister
in
hand
,
then
if
I
go
wrong
after
that
,
let
the
blame
be
on
my
own
shoulder
 
or
on
his
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
eat
his
breakfast
quickly
;
and
do
not
talk
much
to
his
niece
.
<EOS>
but
what
he
do
say
be
of
a
nature
to
make
her
feel
strangely
happy
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
analyse
her
own
feeling
,
or
give
a
reason
for
her
own
confidence
;
but
she
certainly
do
feel
,
and
even
trust
,
that
something
be
go
to
happen
after
breakfast
which
would
make
her
more
happy
than
she
have
be
for
many
month
.
  
<EOS>
"
Janet

"
say
he

look
at
his
watch

if
Mr
Gresham

Mr
Frank
call

show
them
into
my
study

with
yourself

my
dear

"
  
<EOS>

I
do
not

you
be
so
mysterious

I
be
in
such
a
twitter

I
do
not

why
be
Mr

come
here
 
that

business
with

about

Scatcherd
property

owe
Sir
Louis
money

do
not
go
out

Mary

I
want
you
to
be
in
the
way

I
should
have
to
call
for
you

You
can
stay
in
the
drawing

can
not
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes

uncle

here

"
  
"
no
,
dear
;
go
into
the
drawing
-
room

"
<EOS>
Mary
obediently
do
as
she
be
bid
;
and
there
she
sit
,
for
the
next
three
hour
,
wonder
,
wonder
,
wonder
.
<EOS>
during
the
great
part
of
that
time
,
however
,
she
well
know
that
Mr
Gresham
,
senior
,
and
Mr
Gresham
,
junior
,
be
both
with
her
uncle
,
below
.
  
<EOS>
at
eleven
o'clock
the
doctor
's
visitor
come
.
<EOS>
He
have
expect
them
somewhat
earlier
,
and
be
begin
to
become
fidgety
.
<EOS>
He
have
so
much
on
his
hand
that
he
could
not
sit
still
for
a
moment
till
he
have
,
at
any
rate
,
commence
it
.
<EOS>
the
expect
footstep
be
at
last
hear
on
the
gravel
-
path
,
and
a
moment
or
two
afterwards
Janet
usher
the
father
and
son
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
the
squire
do
not
look
very
well
.
<EOS>
He
be
worn
and
sorrowful
,
and
rather
pale
.
<EOS>
the
death
of
his
young
creditor
may
be
suppose
to
have
give
him
some
relief
from
his
more
pressing
care
,
but
the
necessity
of
yield
to
Frank
's
wish
have
almost
more
than
balance
this
.
<EOS>
when
a
man
have
daily
to
reflect
that
he
be
poor
than
he
be
the
day
before
,
he
soon
become
worn
and
sorrowful
.
  
<EOS>
but
Frank
be
well
;
both
in
health
and
spirit
.
<EOS>
He
also
feel
as
Mary
do
,
that
the
day
be
to
bring
forth
something
which
should
end
his
present
trouble
;
and
he
could
not
but
be
happy
to
think
that
he
could
now
tell
Dr
Thorne
that
his
father
's
consent
to
his
marriage
have
be
give
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
shake
hand
with
them
both
,
and
then
they
sit
down
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
rather
constrain
in
their
manner
;
and
at
first
it
seem
that
nothing
but
little
speech
of
compliment
be
to
be
make
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
the
squire
remark
that
Frank
have
be
talk
to
him
about
Miss
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
"
about
Mary
?
"
say
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
about
Mary
,
"
say
the
squire
,
correct
himself
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
unnecessary
that
he
should
use
so
cold
a
name
as
the
other
,
now
that
he
have
agree
to
the
match
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
!
"
say
Dr
Thorne
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
must
be
so
,
doctor
.
<EOS>
He
have
set
his
heart
upon
it
,
and
God
know
,
I
have
nothing
to
say
against
her
 
against
her
personally
.
<EOS>
no
one
could
say
a
word
against
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
sweet
,
good
girl
,
excellently
bring
up
;
and
,
as
for
myself
,
I
have
always
love
her
.
"
<EOS>
Frank
draw
near
to
his
father
,
and
press
his
hand
against
the
squire
's
arm
,
by
way
of
give
him
,
in
some
sort
,
a
filial
embrace
for
his
kindness
.
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
squire
,
thank
you
,
"
say
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
good
of
you
to
say
that
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
good
girl
,
and
if
Frank
choose
to
take
her
,
he
will
,
in
my
estimation
,
have
make
a
good
choice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
choose
!
<EOS>
"
say
Frank
,
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
a
lover
.
  
<EOS>
the
squire
feel
himself
perhaps
a
little
ruffle
at
the
way
in
which
the
doctor
receive
his
gracious
intimation
;
but
he
do
now
show
it
as
he
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
They
can
not
,
you
know
,
doctor
,
look
to
be
rich
people

<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
well
,
well
,
"
interrupt
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
tell
Frank
so
,
and
I
think
that
you
should
tell
Mary
.
<EOS>
Frank
mean
to
take
some
land
into
his
hand
,
and
he
must
farm
it
as
a
farmer
.
<EOS>
I
will
endeavour
to
give
him
three
,
or
perhaps
four
hundred
a
year
.
<EOS>
but
you
know
better
 
"
  
"
stop
,
squire
;
stop
a
minute
.
<EOS>
We
will
talk
about
that
presently
.
<EOS>
this
death
of
poor
Sir
Louis
will
make
a
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
permanently
,
"
say
the
squire
mournfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
Frank
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
not
attend
to
the
squire
's
last
word

"
what
do
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
I
say
?
<EOS>
I
say
what
I
say
to
you
in
London
the
other
day

I
believe
Mary
love
me
;
indeed

I
will
not
be
affect

I
know
she
do

<EOS>
I
have
love
her
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
say
always

,
indeed

I
almost
may
say
so
.
<EOS>
My
father
know
that
this
be
no
light
fancy
of
mine
.
<EOS>
as
to
what
he
say
about
our
be
poor
,
why
 
"
  
the
doctor
be
very
arbitrary
,

would
hear
neither
of
them
on
this
subject

<EOS>
"
Mr
Gresham
,
"
say
he
,
interrupt
Frank
,
"
<EOS>
of
course
I
be
well
aware
how
very
little
suited
Mary
be
by
birth
to
marry
your
only
son

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
too
late
to
think
about
it
now

the
squire

<EOS>
"
It
be
not
too
late
for
me
to
justify
myself

reply
the
doctor

<EOS>
"
We
have
long
know
each
other

Mr
Gresham

you
say
here
the
other

a
subject

blood

very
valuable
gift

<EOS>

I
certainly
think
so

no

for

her
birth
be
equal

Mr

this
marriage

at

himself
sedulously

the
paper

,
in
the
confusion
cause
by
his
own
emotion

transfer
hither

thither

such
a
manner

upset
all
his

arrangement

now
,

I
may

you

there

Sir

be
not

it

<EOS>
of
course

she
must
administer

all
that

I
be
afraid
there
will
be
a

heavy
sum
to
pay
for

can
not

point
that
out

after

it
down

some
of
the

the

Dear
Mary

<EOS>
It
be
,
indeed
,
not
singular
that
she
should
be
prepare
to
act
so
well
,
see
that
in
early
youth
she
have
have
the
advantage
of
an
education
in
the
Greshamsbury
nursery
;
but
not
on
that
account
be
it
the
less
fitting
that
her
virtue
should
be
acknowledge
,
eulogise
,
nay
,
all
but
worship

<EOS>
how
the
party
at

get
itself
break
up

I
be
not
prepared

Frank
,
I
know
,
stay
and
dine
there

his
poor
mother

who
would
not
retire
to
rest
till
she
have
kiss
him
,
and
bless
him
,
and
thank
him
for
all
he
be
do
for
the
family
,
be
keep
wait
in
her
dressing
-
room
till
a
very
unreasonable
hour
of
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
squire
who
bring
the
news
up
to
the
house
.

Arabella
,
"
he
say
,
in
a
low
,

somewhat
solemn
voice

will
be
surprised

it
be
;
it
be
very
,
very
 
"
<EOS>
but
Lady
Arabella
have
faint
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
woman
who
generally
have
her
feeling
and
her
emotion
much
under
her
own
control
;
but
what
she
now
hear
be
too
much
for
her
.
<EOS>
when
she
come
to
her
sense
,
the
first
word
that
escape
her
lip
be
,
"
dear
Mary
!
"
  
<EOS>
but
the
household
have
to
sleep
on
the
news
before
it
could
be
fully
realise
.
<EOS>
the
squire
be
not
by
nature
a
mercenary
man
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
at
all
succeed
in
put
his
character
before
the
reader
,
he
will
be
recognise
as
one
not
over
attach
to
money
for
money
's
sake
.
<EOS>
but
thing
have
go
so
hard
with
him
,
the
world
have
become
so
rough
,
so
ungracious
,
so
full
of
thorn
,
the
want
of
mean
have
become
an
evil
so
keenly
feel
in
every
hour
,
that
it
can
not
be
wonder
at
that
his
dream
that
night
should
be
of
a
golden
elysium
.
<EOS>
the
wealth
be
not
come
to
him
.
<EOS>
true
.
<EOS>
but
his
chief
sorrow
have
be
for
his
son
.
<EOS>
now
that
son
would
be
his
only
creditor
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
though
mountain
of
marble
have
be
take
from
off
his
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
but
Lady
Arabella
's
dream
fly
away
at
once
into
the
seventh
heaven
.
<EOS>
Sordid
<EOS>
as
they
certainly
be
,
they
be
not
absolutely
selfish

<EOS>
Frank
would
now
certainly
be
the
first
commoner
in
Barsetshire
;
of
course
he
would
represent
the
county
;
of
course
there
would
be
the
house
in
town
;
it
would
not
be
her
house
,
but
she
be
content
that
the
grandeur
should
be
that
of
her
child
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
heaven
know
what
to
spend
per
annum
.
<EOS>
and
that
it
should
come
through
Mary
Thorne
!
<EOS>
what
a
blessing
she
have
allow
Mary
to
be
bring
into
the
Greshamsbury
nursery
!
<EOS>
dear
Mary
!
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
of
course
be
one
now
,
"
say
Beatrice
to
her
sister
.
<EOS>
with
her
,
at
the
present
moment
,
"
one
"
of
course
mean
one
of
the
bevy
that
be
to
attend
her
at
the
altar
.
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
!
<EOS>
how
nice
!
<EOS>
I
shall
not
know
what
to
say
to
her
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
but
I
know
one
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
?
"
ask
Augusta
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
be
as
mild
and
as
meek
as
a
little
dove
.
<EOS>
if
she
and
the
doctor
have
lose
every
shilling
in
the
world
,
she
would
have
be
as
proud
as
an
eagle
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
acknowledge
that
Beatrice
have
have
the
wit
to
read
Mary
's
character
aright
.
  
<EOS>
but
Augusta
be
not
quite
pleased
with
the
whole
affair
.
<EOS>
not
that
she
begrudge
her
brother
his
luck
,
or
Mary
her
happiness
.
<EOS>
but
her
idea
of
right
and
wrong
 
perhaps
we
should
rather
say
Lady
Amelia
's
idea
 
would
not
be
fairly
carry
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
after
all
,
Beatrice
,
this
do
not
alter
her
birth
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
be
useless
say
anything
to
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
would
not
break
both
their
heart
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
to
break
their
heart
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
those
who
put
their
dear
and
warm
feeling
under
restraint
rather
than
deviate
from
what
they
know
to
be
proper
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
Augusta
!
<EOS>
she
be
the
stern
professor
of
the
order
of
this
philosophy
;
the
last
in
the
family
who
practise
with
unflinching
courage
its
cruel
behest
;
the
last
,
always
except
the
Lady
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
and
how
sleep
Frank
that
night
?
<EOS>
with
him
,
at
least
,
let
us
hope
,
nay
,
let
us
say
boldly
,
that
his
happy
thought
be
not
of
the
wealth
which
he
be
to
acquire
.
<EOS>
but
yet
it
would
be
something
to
restore
Boxall
Hill
to
Greshamsbury
;
something
to
give
back
to
his
father
those
rumple
vellum
document
,
since
the
departure
of
which
the
squire
have
never
have
a
happy
day
;
nay
,
something
to
come
forth
again
to
his
friend
as
a
gay
,
young
country
squire
,
instead
of
as
a
farmer
,
clod
-
compel
for
his
bread
.
<EOS>
We
would
not
have
him
think
to
be
well
than
he
be
,
nor
would
we
wish
him
to
make
him
of
other
stuff
than
nature
generally
use
.
<EOS>
His
heart
do
exult
at
Mary
's
wealth
;
but
it
leap
high
still
when
he
think
of
purer
joy
.
  
<EOS>
and
what
shall
we
say
of
Mary
's
dream
?
<EOS>
with
her
,
it
be
altogether
what
she
should
give
,
not
at
all
what
she
should
get
.
<EOS>
Frank
have
love
her
so
truly
when
she
be
so
poor
,
such
an
utter
castaway
;
Frank
,
who
have
ever
be
the
heir
of
Greshamsbury
!
<EOS>
Frank
,
who
with
his
beauty
,
and
spirit
,
and
his
talent
may
have
win
the
smile
of
the
rich
,
the
grand
,
the
noble
!
<EOS>
what
lady
's
heart
would
not
have
rejoice
to
be
allow
to
love
her
Frank
?
<EOS>
but
he
have
be
true
to
her
through
everything
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
how
often
she
think
of
that
hour
,
when
suddenly
appear
before
her
,
he
have
strain
her
to
his
breast
,
just
as
she
have
resolve
how
best
to
bear
the
death
-
like
chill
of
his
suppose
estrangement
!
<EOS>
She
be
always
think
of
that
time
.
<EOS>
She
feed
her
love
by
recur
over
and
over
to
the
altered
feeling
of
that
moment
.
<EOS>
any
now
she
could
pay
him
for
his
goodness
.
<EOS>
pay
him
!
<EOS>
no
,
that
would
be
a
base
word
,
a
base
thought
.
<EOS>
Her
payment
must
be
make
,
if
God
would
so
grant
it
,
in
many
,
many
year
to
come
.
<EOS>
but
her
store
,
such
as
it
be
,
should
be
empty
into
his
lap
.
<EOS>
It
be
soothe
to
her
pride
that
she
would
not
hurt
him
by
her
love
,
that
she
would
bring
no
injury
to
the
old
house
.
<EOS>
"
dear
,
dear
Frank
"
she
murmur
,
as
her
waking
dream
,
conquer
at
last
by
sleep
,
give
way
to
those
of
the
fairy
world
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
think
not
only
of
Frank
;
dream
not
only
of
him
.
<EOS>
what
have
he
not
do
for
her
,
that
uncle
of
her
,
who
have
be
more
loving
to
her
than
any
father
!
<EOS>
how
be
he
,
too
,
to
be
pay
?
<EOS>
pay
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
love
can
only
be
pay
in
its
own
coin
:
it
know
of
no
other
legal
tender
.
<EOS>
well
,
if
her
home
be
to
be
Greshamsbury
,
at
any
rate
she
would
not
be
separate
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
what
the
doctor
dream
of
that
,
neither
he
or
any
one
ever
know
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
uncle
,
I
think
you
have
be
asleep
,
"
say
Mary
to
him
that
evening
as
he
move
for
a
moment
uneasily
on
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
asleep
for
the
last
three
-
quarter
of
an
hour
;
 
but
Frank
,
his
guest
,
have
feel
no
offence
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
I
have
not
be
exactly
asleep
,
"
say
he
;
"
but
I
be
very
tired
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
do
it
all
again
,
Frank
,
to
double
the
money
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
get
any
more
tea
,
have
you
,
Mary
?
"
  
<EOS>
on
the
following
morning
,
Beatrice
be
of
course
with
her
friend
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
awkwardness
between
them
in
meeting
.
<EOS>
Beatrice
have
love
her
when
she
be
poor
,
and
though
they
have
not
lately
think
alike
on
one
very
important
subject
,
Mary
be
too
gracious
to
impute
that
to
Beatrice
as
a
crime
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
one
now
,
Mary
;
of
course
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
"

Mary

let
you
!
<EOS>
do
you
remember
what
you
say
once
about
come
,
and
be
near
me
?
<EOS>
I
have
so
often
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
Mary
,
I
must
tell
you
about
Caleb
;
"
and
the
young
lady
settle
herself
on
the
sofa
,
so
as
to
have
a
comfortable
long
talk
.
<EOS>
Beatrice
have
be
quite
right
.
<EOS>
Mary
be
as
meek
with
her
,
and
as
mild
as
a
dove
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
Patience
Oriel
come
.
<EOS>
"
My
fine
,
young

darling
,
magnificent
,
overgrown
heiress

"

Patience

embrace
her
.
<EOS>
"
My
breath
desert
me
,
and
I
be
nearly
stunned
when
I
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
how
small
we
shall
all
be
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
I
be
quite
prepared
to
toady
to
you
immensely
;
but
pray
be
a
little
gracious
to
me
,
for
the
sake
of

<EOS>
Mary
give
a
long
,
long
kiss
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
for
auld
lang
syne
,
Patience
;
when
you
take
me
away
under
your
wing
to
Richmond
.
<EOS>
"
Patience
also
have
love
her
when
she
be
in
her
trouble
,
and
that
love
,
too
,
should
never
be
forget
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
great
difficulty
be
Lady
Arabella
's
first
meeting
with
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
will
go
down
to
her
after
breakfast
,
"
say
her
ladyship
to
Beatrice
,
as
the
two
be
talk
over
the
matter
while
the
mother
be
finish
her
toilet

<EOS>
"
I
be

<EOS>
"
She
be
entitle

every
courtesy

Lady
Arabella

<EOS>
"
I
would
not

world
fail
in
any
respect

her
for
his

<EOS>
"
He
will
be
glad
enough
for
her
to
come

I
be
sure
,
"

Beatrice
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
talk
with
Caleb
this
morning
,
and
he
say
 
"
  
<EOS>
the
matter
be
of
importance
,
and
Lady
Arabella
give
it
her
most
mature
consideration
.
<EOS>
the
manner
of
receive
into
one
's
family
an
heiress
whose
wealth
be
to
cure
all
one
's
difficulty
,
disperse
all
one
's
trouble
,
give
a
balm
to
all
the
wound
of
misfortune
,
must
,
under
any
circumstance
,
be
worthy
of
much
care
.
<EOS>
but
when
that
heiress
have
be
already
treat
as
Mary
have
be
treat
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
her
,
at
any
rate

before
I
go

Courcy

"
be
you
go

<EOS>
"
oh
,
certainly

yes

I
must
see
my

You
do
not
seem
to
realise
the
importance
,
my

of
Frank
's
marriage

<EOS>
He
will
be
in
a
great
hurry
about
it

and
,
indeed

I
can
not

him

I
shall
be
very
much
surprised

earl
do
not

I
must
consult
my

to
ask

"
  
<EOS>
Poor

be
well

that
we

large
party

the
countess

would
come
now

We
could
not

it
off
for
ten
day

could
we
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
put
it
off
ten
day
!

<EOS>
"
yes
;
it
would
be
convenient

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

Mr

would
like
that

at
all

<EOS>
You
know
he
have
make
all
his
arrangement
for
his
sunday

Pshaw
!
<EOS>
the
idea
of
the
parson
's
Sundays
be
allow
to
have
any
bearing
on
such
a
matter
as
Frank
's
wedding
would
now
become
!
<EOS>
why
,
they
would
have
 
how
much
?
<EOS>
between
twelve
and
fourteen
thousand
a
year
!
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
,
who
have
make
her
calculation
a
dozen
time
during
the
night
,
have
never
find
it
to
be
much
less
than
the
large
sum
.
<EOS>
Mr
Oriel
's
Sundays
,
indeed
!
  
<EOS>
after
much
doubt
,
Lady
Arabella
accede
to
her
daughter
's
suggestion
,
that
Mary
should
be
receive
at
Greshamsbury
instead
of
be
call
on
at
the
doctor
's
house
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
think
she
will
not
mind
the
come
up
first
,
"
say
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
could
receive
her
well
here
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
more
 
more
 
more
able
,
you
know
,
to
express
what
I
feel
.
<EOS>
We
have
better
go
into
the
big
drawing
-
room
to
-
day
,
Beatrice
.
<EOS>
Will
you
remember
to
tell
Mrs
Richards
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
certainly
,
"
be
Mary
's
answer
when
Beatrice
,
with
a
voice
a
little
tremble
,
propose
to
her
to
walk
up
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
certainly
I
will
,
if
Lady
Arabella
will
receive
me
;
 
only
one
thing
,
Trichy
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
,
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Frank
will
think
that
I
come
after
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
never
mind
what
he
think
.
<EOS>
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
Mary
,
I
often
call
upon
Patience
for
the
sake
of
find
Caleb
.
<EOS>
that
be
all
fair
now
,
you
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
very
quietly
put
on
her
straw
bonnet
,
and
say
she
be
ready
to
go
up
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
Beatrice
be
a
little
fluttered
,
and
show
it
.
<EOS>
Mary
be
,
perhaps
,
a
good
deal
flutter
,
but
she
do
not
show
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
think
a
good
deal
of
her
first
interview
with
Lady
Arabella
,
of
her
first
return
to
the
house
;
but
she
have
resolve
to
carry
herself
as
though
the
matter
be
easy
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
allow
it
to
be
see
that
she
feel
that
she
bring
with
her
to
Greshamsbury
,
comfort
,
ease
,
and
renew
opulence
.
  
<EOS>
so
she
put
on
her
straw
bonnet
and
walk
up
with
Beatrice
.
<EOS>
everybody
about
the
place
have
already
hear
the
news
.
<EOS>
the
old
woman
at
the
lodge
curtsy
low
to
her
;
the
gardener
,
who
be
mow
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
the
butler
,
who
open
the
front
door
 
<EOS>
he
must
have
be
watch
Mary
's
approach
 
have
manifestly
put
on
a
clean
white
neckcloth
for
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
once
more
,
Miss
Thorne
!
"
say
the
old
man
,
in
a
half
-
whisper
.
<EOS>
Mary
be
somewhat
troubled
,
for
everything
seem
,
in
a
manner
,
to
bow
down
before
her
.
<EOS>
and
why
should
not
everything
bow
down
before
her
,
see
that
she
be
in
truth
the
owner
of
Greshamsbury
?
  
<EOS>
and
then
a
servant
in
livery
would
open
the
big
drawing
-
room
door
.
<EOS>
this
rather
upset
both
Mary
and
Beatrice
.
<EOS>
It
become
almost
impossible
for
Mary
to
enter
the
room
just
as
she
would
have
do
two
year
ago
;
but
she
get
through
the
difficulty
with
much
self

and
then
she

"
He

<EOS>
thus
Mary
be

make
at
home
in
the
household
of
Greshamsbury
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
do
not
carry
out
her
little
plan
of
delay
the
Oriel
wedding
.
<EOS>
Her
idea
have
be
to
add
some
grandeur
to
it
,
in
order
to
make
it
a
more
fitting
precursor
of
that
other
great
wedding
which
be
to
follow
so
soon
in
its
wake
.
<EOS>
but
this
,
with
the
assistance
of
the
countess
,
she
find
herself
able
to
do
without
interfere
with
poor
Mr
Oriel
's
Sunday
arrangement
.
<EOS>
the
countess
herself
,
with
the
Ladies
Alexandrina
and
Margaretta
,
now
promise
to
come
,
even
to
this
first
affair
;
and
for
the
other
,
the
whole
de
Courcy
family
would
turn
out
,
count
and
countess
,
lord
and
lady
,
honourable
george
and
Honourable
Johns
.
<EOS>
what
honour
,
indeed
,
could
be
too
great
to
show
to
a
bride
who
have
fourteen
thousand
a
year
in
her
own
right
,
or
to
a
cousin
who
have
do
his
duty
by
secure
such
a
bride

<EOS>
"
if

I

he

the
countess

<EOS>
"
of
course
,
he
will
be
talk
to
Frank
about
politic

<EOS>
I
suppose
the

will
not
expect
Frank
to
belong
to
the
old
school
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Frank
,
of
course
,
will
judge
for
himself
,
Rosina
;
 
with
his
position
,
you
know
!
"
<EOS>
and
so
thing
be
settle
at
Courcy
Castle
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
Beatrice
be
wed
and
carry
off
to
the
Lakes
.
<EOS>
Mary
,
as
she
have
promise
,
do
stand
near
her
;
but
not
exactly
in
the
gingham
frock
of
which
she
have
once
speak
.
<EOS>
She
wear
on
that
occasion
 
<EOS>
but
it
will
be
too
much
,
perhaps
,
to
tell
the
reader
what
she
wear
as
Beatrice
's
bridesmaid
,
see
that
a
couple
of
page
,
at
least
,
must
be
devoted
to
her
marriage
-
dress
,
and
see
,
also
,
that
we
have
only
a
few
page
to
finish
everything
;
the
list
of
visitor
,
the
marriage
settlement
,
the
dress
,
and
all
include
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
that
Mary
endeavour
to
repress
Lady
Arabella
's
ardour
for
grand
doing
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
she
be
to
be
marry
from
the
doctor
's
house
,
and
not
from
Greshamsbury
,
and
it
be
the
doctor
who
should
have
invite
the
guest
;
but
,
in
this
matter
,
he
do
not
choose
to
oppose
her
ladyship
's
spirit
,
and
she
have
it
all
her
own
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
can
I
do
?
"
say
he
to
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
contradict
her
in
everything
for
the
last
two
year
.
<EOS>
the
least
we
can
do
be
to
let
her
have
her
own
way
now
in
a
trifle
like
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
one
point
on
which
Mary
would
let
nobody
have
his
or
her
own
way
;
on
which
the
way
to
be
take
be
very
manifestly
to
be
her
own
.
<EOS>
this
be
touch
the
marriage
settlement
.
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
suppose
,
that
if
Beatrice
be
marry
on
a
Tuesday
,
Mary
could
be
marry
on
the
Tuesday
week
following
.
<EOS>
lady
with
twelve
thousand
a
year
can
not
be
dispose
of
in
that
way
:
and
bridegroom
who
do
their
duty
by
marry
money
often
have
to
be
keep
wait
.
<EOS>
It
be
spring
,
the
early
spring
,
before
Frank
be
make
altogether
a
happy
man
.
  
<EOS>
but
a
word
about
the
settlement
.
<EOS>
on
this
subject
the
doctor
think
he
would
have
be
drive
mad
.
<EOS>
Messrs
Slow
&
Bideawhile
,
as
the
lawyer
of
the
Greshamsbury
family
 
<EOS>
it
will
be
understand
that
Mr
Gazebee
's
law
business
be
of
quite
a
different
nature
,
and
his
work
,
as
regard
Greshamsbury
,
be
now
nearly
over
 
<EOS>
Messrs
Slow
&
Bideawhile
declare
that
it
would
never
do
for
them
to
undertake
alone
to
draw
out
the
settlement
.
<EOS>
an
heiress
,
such
as
Mary
,
must
have
lawyer
of
her
own
;
half
a
dozen
at
least
,
accord
to
the
apparent
opinion
of
Messrs
Slow
&
Bideawhile
.
<EOS>
and
so
the
doctor
have
to
go
to
other
lawyer
,
and
they
have
again
to
consult
Sir
Abraham
,
and
Mr
Snilam
on
a
dozen
different
head
.
  
<EOS>
if
Frank
become
tenant
in
tail
,
in
right
of
his
wife
,
but
under
his
father
,
would
he
be
able
to
grant
lease
for
more
than
twenty
-
one
year
?
<EOS>
and
,
if
so
,
to
whom
would
the
right
of
trover
belong
?
<EOS>
as
to
flotsam
and
jetsam
 
there
be
a
little
property
,
Mr
Critic
,
on
the
sea
-
shore
 
that
be
a
matter
that
have
to
be
leave
unsettle
at
the
last
.
<EOS>
such
point
as
these
do
take
a
long
time
to
consider
.
<EOS>
all
this
bewilder
the
doctor
sadly
,
and
Frank
himself
begin
to
make
accusation
that
he
be
to
be
do
out
of
his
wife
altogether
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
as
we
have
say
,
there
be
one
point
on
which
Mary
would
have
her
own
way
.
<EOS>
the
lawyer
may
tie
up
as
they
would
on
her
behalf
all
the
money
,
and
share
,
and
mortgage
which
have
belong
to
the
late
Sir
Roger
,
with
this
exception
,
all
that
have
ever
appertain
to
Greshamsbury
should
belong
to
Greshamsbury
again
;
not
in
perspective
,
not
to
her
child
,
or
to
her
child
's
child
,
but
at
once
.
<EOS>
Frank
should
be
lord
of
Boxall
Hill
in
his
own
right
;
and
as
to
those
other
_
lien
_
on
Greshamsbury
,
let
Frank
manage
that
with
his
father
as
he
may
think
fit
.
<EOS>
She
would
only
trouble
herself
to
see
that
he
be
empower
to
do
as
he
do
think
fit
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
argue
the
ancient
,
respectable
family
attorney
to
the
doctor
,
"
that
amount
to
two
-
third
of
the
whole
estate
.
<EOS>
two
-
third
,
Dr
Thorne
!
<EOS>
It
be
preposterous
;
I
should
almost
say
impossible
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
scanty
hair
on
the
poor
man
's
head
almost
stand
on
end
as
he
think
of
the
outrageous
manner
in
which
the
heiress
prepare
to
sacrifice
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
all
be
the
same
in
the
end
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
try
to
make
thing
smooth
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
their
joint
object
will
be
to
put
the
Greshamsbury
property
together
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
 
and
then
,
for
twenty
minute
,
the
lawyer
go
on
prove
that
it
would
by
no
means
be
the
same
thing
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
Mary
Thorne
do
have
her
own
way
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
the
winter
,
Lady
de
Courcy
try
very
hard
to
induce
the
heiress
to
visit
Courcy
Castle
,
and
this
request
be
so
back
by
Lady
Arabella
,
that
the
doctor
say
he
think
she
may
as
well
go
there
for
three
or
four
day
.
<EOS>
but
here
,
again
,
Mary
be
obstinate
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
it
at
all
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
make
a
point
of
it
,
or
Frank
,
or
Mr
Gresham
,
I
will
go
;
but
I
can
not
see
any
possible
reason
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
when
so
appeal
to
,
would
not
absolutely
say
that
he
make
a
point
of
it
,
and
Mary
be
tolerably
safe
as
regard
Frank
or
the
squire
.
<EOS>
if
she
go
,
Frank
would
be
expect
to
go
,
and
Frank
dislike
Courcy
Castle
almost
more
than
ever
.
<EOS>
His
aunt
be
now
more
than
civil
to
him
,
and
,
when
they
be
together
,
never
cease
to
compliment
him
on
the
desirable
way
in
which
he
have
do
his
duty
by
his
family
.
  
<EOS>
and
soon
after
Christmas
a
visitor
come
to
Mary
,
and
stay
a
fortnight
with
her
:
one
whom
neither
she
nor
the
doctor
have
expect
,
and
of
whom
they
have
not
much
more
than
hear
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
famous
Miss
Dunstable
.
<EOS>
"
bird
of
a
feather
flock
together
,
"
say
Mrs
Rantaway
 
<EOS>
late
<EOS>
Miss
Gushing
 
when
she
hear
of
the
visit
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
railway
man
's
niece
 
<EOS>
if
you
can
call
her
a
niece
 
and
<EOS>
the
quack
's
daughter
will
do
very
well
together
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
at
any
rate
,
they
can
count
their
money
-
bag
,
"
say
Mrs
Umbleby
.
  
<EOS>
and
in
fact
,
Mary
and
Miss
Dunstable
do
get
on
very
well
together
;
and
Miss
Dunstable
make
herself
quite
happy
at
Greshamsbury
,
although
some
people
 
include
Mrs
Rantaway
 
contrive
to
spread
a
report
,
that
Dr
Thorne
,
jealous
of
Mary
's
money
,
be
go
to
marry
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
certainly
come
and
see
you
turn
off
,
"
say
Miss
Dunstable
,
take
leave
of
her
new
friend
.
<EOS>
Miss
Dunstable
,
it
must
be
acknowledge
,
be
a
little
too
fond
of
slang
;
but
then
,
a
lady
with
her
fortune
,
and
of
her
age
,
may
be
fond
of
almost
whatever
she
please
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
by
degree
the
winter
wear
away
 
very
slowly
to
Frank
,
as
he
declare
often
enough
;
and
slowly
,
perhaps
,
to
Mary
also
,
though
she
do
not
say
so
.
<EOS>
the
winter
wear
away
,
and
the
chill
,
bitter
,
windy
,
early
spring
come
round
.
<EOS>
the
comic
almanacs
give
us
dreadful
picture
of
January
and
February
;
but
,
in
truth
,
the
month
which
should
be
make
to
look
gloomy
in
England
be
March
and
April
.
<EOS>
let
no
man
boast
himself
that
he
have
get
through
the
peril
of
winter
till
at
least
the
seventh
of
May
  
<EOS>
It
be
early
in
April
,
however
,
that
the
great
doing
be
to
be
do
at
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
not
exactly
on
the
first
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
presume
,
that
in
spite
of
the
practical
,
common
-
sense
spirit
of
the
age
,
very
few
people
do
choose
to
have
themselves
unite
on
that
day
.
<EOS>
but
some
day
in
the
first
week
of
that
month
be
fix
for
the
ceremony
,
and
from
the
end
of
February
all
through
March
,
Lady
Arabella
work
and
strove
in
a
manner
that
entitle
her
to
profound
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
at
last
settle
that
the
breakfast
should
be
hold
in
the
large
dining
-
room
at
Greshamsbury
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
difficulty
about
it
which
tax
Lady
Arabella
to
the
utmost
,
for
,
in
make
the
proposition
,
she
could
not
but
seem
to
be
throw
some
slight
on
the
house
in
which
the
heiress
have
live
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
affair
be
once
open
to
Mary
,
it
be
astonish
how
easy
it
become
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
"
say
Mary
,
"
<EOS>
all
the
room
in
our
house
would
not
hold
half
the
people
you
be
talk
about
 
if
they
must
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
look
so
beseechingly
,
nay
,
so
piteously
,
that
Mary
have
not
another
word
to
say
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
that
they
must
all
come
:
the
de
Courcys
to
the
fifth
generation
;
the
Duke
of
Omnium
himself
,
and
other
in
concatenation
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
will
your
uncle
be
angry
if
we
have
the
breakfast
up
here
?
<EOS>
He
have
be
so
very
handsome
to
Frank
,
that
I
would
not
make
him
angry
for
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
do
not
tell
him
anything
about
it
,
Lady
Arabella
,
he
will
think
that
it
be
all
do
properly
.
<EOS>
He
will
never
know
,
if
he
be
not
tell
,
that
he
ought
to
give
the
breakfast
,
and
not
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
will
not
he
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
and
Lady
Arabella
look
her
admiration
for
this
very
talented
suggestion
.
<EOS>
and
so
that
matter
be
arrange
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
never
know
,
till
Mary
tell
him
some
year
or
so
afterwards
,
that
he
have
be
remiss
in
any
part
of
his
duty
.
  
<EOS>
and
who
be
ask
to
the
wedding
?
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
we
have
say
that
the
Duke
of
Omnium
be
there
.
<EOS>
this
be
,
in
fact
,
the
one
circumstance
that
make
this
wedding
so
superior
to
any
other
that
have
ever
take
place
in
that
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Omnium
never
go
anywhere
;
and
yet
he
go
to
Mary
's
wedding
!
<EOS>
and
Mary
,
when
the
ceremony
be
over
,
absolutely
find
herself
kiss
by
a
duke
.
"
<EOS>
Dearest
Mary
!
"
exclaim
Lady
Arabella
,
in
her
ecstasy
of
joy
,
when
she
see
the
honour
that
be
do
to
her
daughter
-
in
-
law
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
we
shall
induce
you
to
come
to
Gatherum
Castle
soon
,
"
say
the
duke
to
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
have
a
few
friend
there
in
the
autumn
.
<EOS>
let
me
see
;
I
declare
,
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
you
since
you
be
good
enough
to
come
to
my
collection
.
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
It
be
not
bad
fun
,
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
Frank
be
not
very
cordial
with
his
answer
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
quite
reconcile
himself
to
the
difference
of
his
position
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
treat
as
one
of
the
"
collection
"
at
Gatherum
Castle
,
he
have
not
marry
money
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
vain
to
enumerate
all
the
de
Courcys
that
be
there
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
earl
,
look
very
gracious
,
and
talk
to
the
squire
about
the
county
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
Lord
Porlock
,
look
very
ungracious
,
and
not
talk
to
anybody
about
anything
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
the
countess
,
who
for
the
last
week
past
have
do
nothing
but
pat
Frank
on
the
back
whenever
she
could
catch
him
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
the
Ladies
Alexandrina
,
Margaretta
,
and
Selina
,
smile
at
everybody
.
<EOS>
and
the
honourable
George
,
talk
in
whisper
to
Frank
about
his
widow
 
"
not
such
a
catch
as
yours
,
you
know
;
but
something
extremely
snug
;
 
and
have
it
all
my
own
way
,
too
,
old
fellow
,
or
I
shall
not
come
to
the
scratch
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
honourable
John
prepare
to
toady
Frank
about
his
string
of
hunter
;
and
the
Lady
Amelia
,
by
herself
,
not
quite
contented
with
these
democratic
nuptial
 
<EOS>
"
after
all
,
she
be
so
absolutely
nobody
;
absolutely
,
absolutely
,
"
she
say
confidentially
to
Augusta
,
shake
her
head
.
<EOS>
but
before
Lady
Amelia
have
leave
Greshamsbury
,
Augusta
be
quite
at
a
loss
to
understand
how
there
could
be
need
for
so
much
conversation
between
her
cousin
and
Mr
Mortimer
Gazebee
.
  
<EOS>
and
there
be
many
more
de
Courcys
,
whom
to
enumerate
<EOS>
would
be
much
too
long
.
  
<EOS>
and
the
bishop
of
the
diocese
,
and
Mrs
Proudie
be
there
.
<EOS>
a
hint
have
even
be
give
,
that
his
lordship
would
himself
condescend
to
perform
the
ceremony
,
if
this
should
be
wish
;
but
that
work
have
already
be
anticipate
by
a
very
old
friend
of
the
Greshams
.
<EOS>
Archdeacon
Grantly
,
the
rector
of
Plumstead
Episcopi
,
have
long
since
undertake
this
part
of
the
business
;
and
the
knot
be
eventually
tie
by
the
joint
effort
of
himself
and
Mr
Oriel
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Grantly
come
with
him
,
and
so
do
Mrs
Grantly
's
sister
,
the
new
dean
's
wife
.
<EOS>
the
dean
himself
be
at
the
time
unfortunately
absent
at
Oxford
.
  
<EOS>
and
all
the
Bakers
and
the
Jacksons
be
there
.
<EOS>
the
last
time
they
have
all
meet
together
under
the
squire
's
roof
,
be
on
the
occasion
of
Frank
's
coming
of
age
.
<EOS>
the
present
gala
doing
be
carry
on
a
very
different
spirit
.
<EOS>
that
have
be
a
very
poor
affair
,
but
this
be
worthy
of
the
good
day
of
Greshamsbury
.
  
<EOS>
Occasion
also
have
be
take
of
this
happy
moment
to
make
up
,
or
rather
to
get
rid
of
the
last
shred
of
the
last
feud
that
have
so
long
separate
Dr
Thorne
from
his
own
relative
.
<EOS>
the
Thornes
of
Ullathorne
have
make
many
overture
in
a
covert
way
.
<EOS>
but
our
doctor
have
contrive
to
reject
them
.
<EOS>
"
They
would
not
receive
Mary
as
their
cousin
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
I
will
go
nowhere
that
she
can
not
go
.
<EOS>
"
but
now
all
this
be
alter
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Gresham
would
certainly
be
receive
in
any
house
in
the
county
.
<EOS>
and
thus
,
Mr
Thorne
of
Ullathorne
,
an
amiable
,
popular
old
bachelor
,
come
to
the
wedding
;
and
so
do
his
maiden
sister
,
Miss
Monica
Thorne
,
than
whose
no
kind
heart
glow
through
all
Barsetshire
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
say
she
to
Mary
,
kiss
her
,
and
offer
her
some
little
tribute
,
"
I
be
very
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
;
very
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
her
fault
,
"
she
add
,
speak
to
herself
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
that
she
will
be
a
Gresham
,
that
nee
not
be
any
longer
be
think
of
.
<EOS>
"
nevertheless
,
could
miss
Thorne
have
speak
her
inward
thought
out
loud
,
she
would
have
declare
,
that
Frank
would
have
do
better
to
have
bear
his
poverty
than
marry
wealth
without
blood
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
there
be
but
few
so
stanch
as
Miss
Thorne
;
perhaps
none
in
that
county
 
always
except
Lady
Amelia
.
  
<EOS>
and
Miss
Dunstable
,
also
,
be
a
bridesmaid
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
"
say
she
,
when
ask
;
"
you
should
have
them
young
and
pretty
.
"
<EOS>
but
she
give
way
when
she
find
that
Mary
do
not
flatter
her
by
tell
her
that
she
be
either
the
one
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
"
say
Miss
Dunstable
,
"
I
have
always
be
a
little
in
love
with
your
Frank
,
and
so
I
shall
do
it
for
his
sake
.
"
<EOS>
there
be
but
four
:
the
other
two
be
the
Gresham
twin
.
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
exert
herself
greatly
in
frame
hint
to
induce
Mary
to
ask
some
of
the
de
Courcy
ladie
to
do
her
so
much
honour
;
but
on
this
head
Mary
would
please
herself
.
<EOS>
"
rank
,
"
say
she
to
Beatrice
,
with
a
curl
on
her
lip
,
"
have
its
drawback
 
and
must
put
up
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
now
I
find
that
I
have
not
one
page
 
not
half
a
page
 
for
the
wedding
-
dress
.
<EOS>
but
what
matter
?
<EOS>
Will
it
not
be
all
find
write
in
the
column
of
the
_
Morning
Post
_
?
  
<EOS>
and
thus
Frank
married
money
,
and
become
a
great
man
.
<EOS>
let
us
hope
that
he
will
be
a
happy
man
.
<EOS>
as
the
time
of
the
story
have
be
bring
down
so
near
to
the
present
era
,
it
be
not
practicable
for
the
novelist
to
tell
much
of
his
future
career
.
<EOS>
when
I
last
hear
from
Barsetshire
,
it
seem
to
be
quite
settle
that
he
be
to
take
the
place
of
one
of
the
old
member
at
the
next
election
;
and
they
say
,
also
,
that
there
be
no
chance
of
any
opposition
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
,
too
,
that
there
have
be
many
very
private
consultation
between
him
and
various
gentleman
of
the
county
,
with
reference
to
the
hunt
;
and
the
general
feeling
be
say
to
be
that
the
hound
should
go
to
Boxall
Hill
.
  
<EOS>
at
Boxall
Hill
the
young
people
establish
themselves
on
their
return
from
the
Continent
.
<EOS>
and
that
remind
me
that
one
word
must
be
say
of
Lady
Scatcherd
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
always
stay
here
with
us
,
"
say
Mary
to
her
,
caress
her
ladyship
's
rough
hand
,
and
look
kindly
into
that
kind
face
.
  
<EOS>
but
Lady
Scatcherd
would
not
consent
to
this
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
come
and
see
you
sometimes
,
and
then
I
shall
enjoy
myself
.
<EOS>
yes
,
I
will
come
and
see
you
,
and
my
own
dear
boy
.
<EOS>
"
the
affair
be
end
by
her
take
Mrs
Opie
Green
's
cottage
,
in
order
that
she
may
be
near
the
doctor
;
Mrs
Opie
Green
have
marry
 
somebody
.
  
<EOS>
and
of
whom
else
must
we
say
a
word
?
<EOS>
patience
,
also
,
of
course
,
get
a
husband
 
or
will
do
so
.
<EOS>
dear
Patience
!
<EOS>
it
would
be
a
thousand
pity
that
so
good
a
wife
should
be
lose
to
the
world
.
<EOS>
whether
Miss
Dunstable
will
ever
be
married
,
or
Augusta
Gresham
,
or
Mr
Moffat
,
or
any
of
the
tribe
of
the
de
Courcys
 
except
<EOS>
Lady
Amelia
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
They
have
all
of
them
still
their
future
before
them
.
<EOS>
that
Bridget
be
marry
to
Thomas
 
that
I
be
able
to
assert
;
for
I
know
that
Janet
be
much
put
out
by
their
joint
desertion
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Arabella
have
not
yet
lose
her
admiration
for
Mary
,
and
Mary
,
in
return
,
behave
admirably
.
<EOS>
another
event
be
expect
,
and
her
ladyship
be
almost
as
anxious
about
that
as
she
be
about
the
wedding
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
matter
,
you
know
,
of
such
importance
in
the
county
!
<EOS>
"
she
whisper
to
Lady
de
Courcy
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
can
be
more
happy
than
the
intercourse
between
the
squire
and
his
son
.
<EOS>
what
their
exact
arrangement
be
,
we
need
not
specially
inquire
;
but
the
demon
of
pecuniary
embarrassment
have
lift
his
black
wing
from
the
demesne
of
Greshamsbury
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
we
have
<EOS>
but
one
word
leave
for
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
do
not
come
and
dine
with
me
,
"
say
the
squire
to
him
,
when
they
find
themselves
both
desert
,
"
mind
I
shall
come
and
dine
with
you
.
"
<EOS>
and
on
this
principle
they
seem
to
act
.
<EOS>
Dr
Thorne
continue
to
extend
his
practice
,
to
the
great
disgust
of
Dr
Fillgrave
;
and
when
Mary
suggest
to
him
that
he
should
retire
,
he
almost
box
her
ear
.
<EOS>
He
know
the
way
,
however
,
to
Boxall
Hill
as
well
as
he
ever
do
,
and
be
willing
to
acknowledge
,
that
the
tea
there
be
almost
as
good
as
it
ever
be
at
Greshamsbury
.
