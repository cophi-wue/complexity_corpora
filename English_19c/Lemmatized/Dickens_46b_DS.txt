DOMBEY

in
the
corner
of
the
darkened
room
in
the
great
arm

chair
by
the
bedside
,
and
Son
lie
tuck
up
warm
in
a
little
basket
bedstead
,
carefully
dispose
on
a
low
settee
immediately
in
front
of
the
fire
and
close
to
it
,
as
if
his
constitution
be
analogous
to
that
of
a
muffin
,
and
it
be
essential
to
toast
him
brown
while
he
be
very
new
.
  
<EOS>
Dombey

rather
red

and
though
a
handsome

make

too
stern
and
pompous
in
appearance
,
to
be
prepossess
.
<EOS>
Son
be
very
bald
,
and
very
red
,
and
though
(
of
course
)
an
undeniably
fine
infant
,
somewhat
crushed
and
spotty
in
his
general
effect
,
as
yet
.
<EOS>
on
the
brow
of
Dombey
,
Time
and
his
brother
Care
have
set
some
mark
,
as
on
a
tree
that
be
to
come
down
in
good
time
---
remorseless
twin
they
be
for
stride
through
their
human
forest
,
<EOS>
notch
as
they
go
---
while
the
countenance
of
Son
be
cross
and
recrosse
with
a
thousand
little
crease
,
which
the
same
deceitful
Time
would
take
delight
in
smooth
out
and
wear
away
with
the
flat
part
of
his
scythe
,
as
a
preparation
of
the
surface
for
his
deep
operation
.
  
<EOS>
Dombey
,
exult
in
the
long
-
look
-
for
event
,
jingled
and
jingle
the
heavy
gold
watch
-
chain
that
depend
from
below
his
trim
blue
coat
,
whereof
the
button
sparkle
phosphorescently
in
the
feeble
ray
of
the
distant
fire
.
<EOS>
Son
,
with
his
little
fist
curl
up
and
clench
,
seem
,
in
his
feeble
way
,
to
be
square
at
existence
for
have
come
upon
him
so
unexpectedly
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
house
will

Mrs
Dombey

"
say
Mr
Dombey
,
"
be
not
only
in
name
but
in
fact
Dombey
and
Son
;
Dom

bey

Son
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
word
have
such
a
softening
influence
,
that
he
append
a
term
of
endearment
to
Mrs
Dombey
's
name
(
though
not
without
some
hesitation
,
as
be
a
man
but
little
used
to
that
form
of
address
)
:
and
say
,
"
Mrs
Dombey
,
my
---
my
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
transient
flush
of
faint
surprise
overspread
the
sick
lady
's
face
as
she
raise
her
eye
towards
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
be
christen
Paul
,
my

Mrs
Dombey

of
course

"
  
<EOS>
She
feebly
echo
,
"
of
course
,
"
or
rather
express
it
by
the
motion
of
her
lip
,
and
close
her
eye
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
father
's
name

and
his
grandfather

<EOS>
I
wish
his
grandfather
be
alive
this
day
!
"
<EOS>
and
again
he
say
"
Dom
-
bey
and
Son
,
"
in
exactly
the
same
tone
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
those
three
word
convey
the
one
idea
of
Mr
Dombey
's
life
.
<EOS>
the
earth
be
make
for
Dombey
and
Son
to
trade
in
,
and
the
sun
and
moon
be
make
to
give
them
light

<EOS>
river

;

against
their

;

their

inviolate
a

of
which

<EOS>
common
abbreviation
take
new
meaning
in
his
eye
,
and
have
sole
reference
to
them
:
ad
have
no
concern
with
anno
Domini
,
but
stand
for
anno
Dombei
---
and
Son
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
rise
,
as
his
father
have
before
him
,
in
the
course
of
life
and
death
,
from
Son
to
Dombey
,
and
for
nearly
twenty
year
have
be
the
sole
representative
of
the
firm
.
<EOS>
of
those
year
he
have
be
marry
,
ten
---
married
,
as
some
say
,
to
a
lady
with
no
heart
to
give
him
;
whose
happiness
be
in
the
past
,
and
who
be
content
to
bind
her
broken
spirit
to
the
dutiful
and
meek
endurance
of
the
present
.
<EOS>
such
idle
talk
be
little
likely
to
reach
the
ear
of
Mr
Dombey
,
whom
it
nearly
concern
;
and
probably
no
one
in
the
world
would
have
receive
it
with
such
utter
incredulity
as
he
,
if
it
have
reach
him
.
<EOS>
Dombey
and
Son
have
often
deal
in
hide
,
but
never
in
heart
.
<EOS>
They
leave
that
fancy
ware
to
boy
and
girl
,
and
boarding
-
school
and
book
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
would
have
reason
:
that
a
matrimonial
alliance
with
himself
must
,
in
the
nature
of
thing
,
be
gratify
and
honourable
to
any
woman
of
common
sense
.
<EOS>
that
the
hope
of
give
birth
to
a
new
partner
in
such
a
house
,
could
not
fail
to
awaken
a
glorious
and
stirring
ambition
in
the
breast
of
the
least
ambitious
of
her
sex
.
<EOS>
that
Mrs
Dombey
have
enter
on
that
social
contract
of
matrimony
:
almost
necessarily
part
of
a
genteel
and
wealthy
station
,
even
without
reference
to
the
perpetuation
of
family
firm
:
with
her
eye
fully
open
to
these
advantage
.
<EOS>
that
Mrs
Dombey
have
have
daily
practical
knowledge
of
his
position
in
society
.
<EOS>
that
Mrs
Dombey
have
always
sit
at
the
head
of
his
table
,
and
do
the
honour
of
his
house
in
a
remarkably
lady
-
like
and
become
manner
.
<EOS>
that
Mrs
Dombey
must
have
be
happy
.
<EOS>
that
she
could
not
help
it
.
  
<EOS>
or
,
at
all
event
,
with
one
drawback
.
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
that
he
would
have
allow
.
<EOS>
with
only
one
;
but
that
one
certainly
involve
much
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
marry
ten
year
,
and
until
this
present
day
on
which
Mr
Dombey
sit
jingle
and
jingle
his
heavy
gold
watch
-
chain
in
the
great
arm
-
chair
by
the
side
of
the
bed
,
have
have
no
issue
.
   
<EOS>
---
to
speak
of
;
none
worth
mention
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
girl
some
six
year
before
,
and
the
child
,
who
have
steal
into
the
chamber
unobserved
,
be
now
crouch
timidly
,
in
a
corner
whence
she
could
see
her
mother
's
face
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
a
girl
to
Dombey
and
Son
!
<EOS>
in
the
capital
of
the
House
's
name
and
dignity
,
such
a
child
be
merely
a
piece
of
base
coin
that
could
not
be
invest
---
a
bad
boy
---
nothing
more
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
's
cup
of
satisfaction
be
so
full
at
this
moment
,
however
,
that
he
feel
he
could
afford
a
drop
or
two
of
its
content
,
even
to
sprinkle
on
the
dust
in
the
by
-
path
of
his
little
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
so
he
say
,
"
Florence
,
you
may
go
and
look
at
your
pretty
brother
,
if
you
like
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
do
not
touch
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
child
glance
keenly
at
the
blue
coat
and
stiff
white
cravat
,
which
,
with
a
pair
of
creak
boot
and
a
very
loud
ticking
watch
,
embody
her
idea
of
a
father
;
but
her
eye
return
to
her
mother
's
face
immediately
,
and
she
neither
move
nor
answer
.
  
<EOS>
next
moment
,
the
lady
have
open
her
eye
and
see
the
child
;
and
the
child
have
run
towards
her
;
and
,
stand
on
tip
-
toe
,
the
well
to
hide
her
face
in
her
embrace
,
have
cling
about
her
with
a
desperate
affection
very
much
at
variance
with
her
year
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
Lord
bless
me
!
"
say
Mr
Dombey
,
rise
testily
.
<EOS>
"
a
very
ill
-
advise
and
feverish
proceed
this
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
I
have
better
ask
Doctor
Peps
if
he
will
have
the
goodness
to
step
up
stair
again
perhaps
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
down
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
down
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
beg
you
,
"
he
add
,
pause
for
a
moment
at
the
settee
before
the
fire
,
"
to
take
particular
care
of
this
young
gentleman
,
Mrs
<EOS>
---
"
  
"
Blockitt
,
Sir
?
"
suggest
the
nurse
,
a
simper
piece
of
fade
gentility
,
who
do
not
presume
to
state
her
name
as
a
fact
,
but
merely
offer
it
as
a
mild
suggestion
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
this
young
gentleman
,
Mrs
Blockitt
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no

Sir

indeed

<EOS>
I
remember
when
Miss
Florence
be

"
  
"
ay
,
ay
,
ay

"
say
Mr
Dombey
,
bend
over
the
basket
bedstead
,
and
slightly
bend
his
brow
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Miss
Florence
be
all
very
well
,
but
this
be
another
matter
.
<EOS>
this
young
gentleman
have
to
accomplish
a
destiny
.
<EOS>
a
destiny
,
little
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
as
he
thus
apostrophise
the
infant
he
raise
one
of
his
hand
to
his
lip
,
and
kiss
it
;
then
,
seem
to
fear
that
the
action
involve
some
compromise
of
his
dignity
,
go
,
awkwardly
enough
,
away
.
  
<EOS>
doctor
Parker
Peps
,
one
of
the
Court
Physicians
,
and
a
man
of
immense
reputation
for
assist
at
the
increase
of
great
family
,
be
walk
up
and
down
the
drawing
-
room
with
his
hand
behind
him
,
to
the
unspeakable
admiration
of
the
family
surgeon
,
who
have
regularly
puff
the
case
for
the
last
six
week
,
among
all
his
patient
,
friend
,
and
acquaintance
,
as
one
to
which
he
be
in
hourly
expectation
day
and
night
of
be
summon
,
in
conjunction
with
Doctor
Parker
Peps
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Sir
,
"
say
Doctor
Parker
Peps
in
a
round
,
deep
,
sonorous
voice
,
muffle
for
the
occasion
,
like
the
knocker
;
"
do
you
find
that
your
dear
lady
be
at
all
rouse
by
your
visit
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
stimulate
as
it
be
?
"
say
the
family
practitioner
faintly
:
bow
at
the
same
time
to
the
Doctor
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
excuse
my
putting
in
a
word
,
but
this
be
a
valuable
connexion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
be
quite
discomfited
by
the
question
.
<EOS>
He
have
think
so
little
of
the
patient
,
that
he
be
not
in
a
condition
to
answer
it
.
<EOS>
He
say
that
it
would
be
a
satisfaction
to
him
,
if
Doctor
Parker
Peps
would
walk
up
stair
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
!
<EOS>
We
must
not
disguise
from
you
,
Sir
,
"
say
Doctor
Parker
Peps
,
"
that
there
be
a
want
of
power
in
Her
grace
the
Duchess

I
beg
your
pardon
;
I
confound
name
;
I
should
say
,
in
your
amiable
lady
.
<EOS>
that
there
be
a
certain
degree
of
languor
,
and
a
general
absence
of
elasticity
,
which
we
would
rather
---
not
---
"
  
"
see
,
"
interpose
the
family
practitioner
with
another
inclination
of
the
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
quite
so
,
"
say
Doctor
Parker
Peps
,
"
which
we
would
rather
not
see
.
<EOS>
It
would
appear
that
the
system
of
Lady
Cankaby
---
excuse
me
:
I
should
say
of
Mrs
Dombey
:
<EOS>
I
confuse
the
name

"
so
very
numerous

"
murmur
the
family
practitioner

can
not

quite
wonderful

"
thank
you
,
"
say
the
Doctor
,
"
quite
so
.
<EOS>
It
would
appear
,
I
be
observe
,
that
the
system
of
our
patient
have
sustain
a
shock
,
from
which
it
can
only
hope
to
rally
by
a
great
and
strong

"
and
vigorous
,
"
murmur
the
family
practitioner
.
  
<EOS>
"
quite
so
,
"
assent
the
Doctor

"
and
vigorous
effort
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pilkins
here
,
who
from
his
position
of
medical
adviser
in
this
family
---
no
one
better
qualify
to
fill
that
position
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh

murmur
the
family
practitioner
.

<EOS>
"
praise
from
Sir
Hubert
Stanley

"
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
be
good
enough
,
"
return
Doctor
Parker
Peps
,
"
to
say
so
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pilkins
who
,
from
his
position
,
be
best
acquaint
with
the
patient
's
constitution
in
its
normal
state
(
an
acquaintance
very
valuable
to
us
in
form
our
opinion
on
these
occasion
)
,
be
of
opinion
,
with
me
,
that
Nature
must
be
call
upon
to
make
a
vigorous
effort
in
this
instance
;
and
that
if
our
interesting
friend
the
Countess
of
Dombey
---
I
beg
your
pardon
;
Mrs
Dombey
---
should
not
be

"
  
"
able
,
"
say
the
family
practitioner
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
make
that
effort
successfully
,
"
say
Doctor
Parker
Peps
,
"
then
a
crisis
may
arise
,
which
we
should
both
sincerely
deplore
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
that
,
they
stand
for
a
few
second
look
at
the
ground
.
<EOS>
then
,
on
the
motion
---
make
in
dumb
show
---
of
Doctor
Parker
Peps
,
they
go
up
stair
;
the
family
practitioner
open
the
room
door
for
that
distinguished
professional
,
and
follow
him
out
,
with
most
obsequious
politeness
.
  
<EOS>
to
record
of
Mr
Dombey
that
he
be
not
in
his
way
affect
by
this
intelligence
,
would
be
to
do
him
an
injustice
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
man
of
whom
it
could
properly
be
say
that
he
be
ever
startle
or
shock
;
but
he
certainly
have
a
sense
within
him
,
that
if
his
wife
should
sicken
and
decay
,
he
would
be
very
sorry
,
and
that
he
would
find
a
something
go
from
among
his
plate
and
furniture
,
and
other
household
possession
,
which
be
well
worth
the
have
,
and
could
not
be
lose
without
sincere
regret
.
<EOS>
though
it
would
be
a
cool
,
business
-
like
,
gentlemanly
,
self
-
possess
regret
,
no
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
His
meditation
on
the
subject
be
soon
interrupt
,
first
by
the
rustling
of
garment
on
the
staircase
,
and
then
by
the
sudden
whisking
into
the
room
of
a
lady
rather
past
the

weak

silly

I
know

to

so
trembly

shaky

I
be
so
very
queer
that
I
must
ask
you
for
a
glass
of
wine

a
morsel
of
that
cake

I

I

down

but
for
this
she
may
have
be
describe
as
the
very
pink
of
general
propitiation
and
politeness

<EOS>
from
a
long
habit
of
listen
admirably
to
everything
that
be

look
at

side

Her
hand
have
contract
a
spasmodic
habit
of
raise
themselves
of
their
own
accord
as
in
involuntary
admiration

<EOS>
Her
eye
be
liable
to
a
similar
affection

<EOS>
She
have
the
soft
voice
that
ever
be
hear
;
and
her
nose
,
stupendously
aquiline

have
a

knob

Miss

's
dress
,
though
perfectly
genteel

good

have
a
certain
character

angularity

scantiness

<EOS>
She
be
accustomed
to
wear
odd
weedy
little
flower
in
her
bonnet

cap
.
<EOS>
strange
grass
be
sometimes
perceive
in
her
hair
;
and
it
be
observe
by
the
curious

of
all
her
collar

frill
,
tucker

wristband

other
gossamer
article

indeed
of
everything

the

stand
up

small

<EOS>
these
and
other
appearance

serve
to
propagate
the
opinion

Admonished

however

that
he
have
commit

by
the
indignation
express

countenance
at
the
idea
of
a

there

atone

a
bright
suggestion

he
add
:
  
"

Could
not
something
temporary

do
with

if
he
have

effectually

after
look
at

<EOS>
It
would
have
be

generally
speak

very
difficult
to
have
bet
on
the
winner

<EOS>
often
when
Mr

seem
beat

he
would
suddenly
make
a
start

turn
the

clatter
them
about
the

carry

similar
unlookedfor

Mr

the
death
of
his
wife

absorb
in
vision
of
the
youth
,
education
,
and
destination
of
his
baby
son
.
<EOS>
something
lie
at
the
bottom
of
his
cool
heart
,
cold
and
heavy
than
its
ordinary
load
;
but
it
be
more
a
sense
of
the
child
's
loss
than
his
own
,
awaken
within
him
an
almost
angry
sorrow
.
<EOS>
that
the
life
and
progress
on
which
he
build
such
hope
,
should
be
endanger
in
the
outset
by
<EOS>
so
mean
a
want
;
that
Dombey
and
Son
should
be
totter
for
a
nurse
,
be
a
sore
humiliation
.
<EOS>
and
yet
in
his
pride
and
jealousy
,
he
view
with
so
much
bitterness
the
thought
of
be
dependent
for
the
very
first
step
towards
the
accomplishment
of
his
soul
's
desire
,
on
a
hire
serving
-
woman
who
would
be
to
the
child
,
for
the
time
,
all
that
even
his
alliance
could
have
make
his
own
wife
,
that
in
every
new
rejection
of
a
candidate
he
feel
a
secret
pleasure
.
<EOS>
the
time
have
now
come
,
however
,
when
he
could
no

be
divide
between
these
two
set
of
feeling

<EOS>
the
less
so
,
as
there
seem
to
be
no
flaw
in
the
title
of
Polly

after
his

have
set
it
forth
,
with
many
commendation
on
the
indefatigable
friendship
of
Miss

<EOS>
"

My

<EOS>
so
far

I

you

possible

there

whether

pluck
away
the

confidence

do

more
in

make
a
charge

neglect

gentle

so
quiet

uncomplaining

be
possess

much
affection

sorrowful

in

Nothwithstanding
Mr

great
reliance
on
Polly

she
be
perhaps
in
point
of
artificial
accomplishment
very
little
his
superior

but
she
be
a
good
plain
sample
of
a
nature
that
be
ever
,
in
the
mass
,
well
,
true
,
high
,
noble
,
quick
to
feel

and
much
more
constant
to
retain

all
tenderness

self

denial

devotion

than
the
nature
of

and
,
perhaps
,
unlearn
as
she
be

she
could
have
bring
a
dawn
knowledge
home
to
Mr

at
that
early
day
,
which
would
not
then
have
strike
him
in
the
end
like
lightning

<EOS>
but
this
be
from
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
polly
only
think
,
at
that
time
,
of
improve
on
her
successful
propitiation
of
Miss
Nipper
,
and
devise
some
mean
of
have
little
Florence
beside
her

lawfully
,
and
without
rebellion
.
<EOS>
an
opening
happen
to
present
itself
that
very
night

<EOS>
She
have
be
ring
down
into
the
glass
room
as
usual
,
and
have
walk
about
and
about
it
a
long
time
,
with
the
baby
in
her
arm
,
when
,
to
her
great
surprise
and
dismay
<EOS>
,
Mr

come
out
,
suddenly
,
and
stop
before
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
evening
,
Richards

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
just
the
same
austere
,
stiff
gentleman
,
as
he
have
appear
to
her
on
that
first
day
.
<EOS>
such
a
hard
-
look
gentleman
,
that
she
involuntarily
drop
her
eye
and
her
curtsey
at
the
same
time

<EOS>
"
how
be
Master
Paul
,
Richards
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
quite
thriving
,
Sir
,
and
well

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
look
so
,
"
say
Mr
Dombey
,
glance
with
great
interest
at
the
tiny
face
she
uncover
for
his
observation
,
and
yet
affect
to
be
half
careless
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
They
give
you
everything
you
want
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
,
thank
you
,
Sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
suddenly
append
such
an
obvious
hesitation
to
this
reply
,
however
,
that
Mr
Dombey
,
who
have
turn
away
,
stop
,
and
turn
round
again
,
inquiringly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
nothing
be
so
good
for
make
child
lively
and
cheerful
,
Sir
,
as
see
other
child
play
about
'
em
,
"
observe
Polly
,
take
courage
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
mention
to
you
,
Richards
,
when
you
come
here
,
"
say
Mr
Dombey
,
with
a
frown
,
"
that
I
wish
you
to
see
as
little
of
your
family
as
possible
.
<EOS>
You
can
continue
your
walk
if
you
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
with
that
,
he
disappear
into
his
inner
room
;
and
Polly
have
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
that
he
have
thoroughly
misunderstand
her
object
,
and
that
she
have
fall
into
disgrace
without
the
least
advancement
of
her
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
next
night
,
she
find
him
walk
about
the
conservatory
when
she
come
down
.
<EOS>
as
she
stop
at
the
door
,
check
by
this
unusual
sight
,
and
uncertain
whether
to
advance
or
retreat
,
he
call
her
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
really
think
that
sort
of
society
be
good
the
child
,
"
he
say
sharply
,
as
if
there
have
be
no
interval
since
she
propose
it
,
"
where
be
Miss
Florence
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
could
be
well
than
Miss
Florence
,
Sir
,
"
say
Polly
eagerly
,
"
but
I
understand
from
her
little
maid
that
they
be
not
to
---
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
ring
the
bell
,
and
walk
till
it
be
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
tell
them
always
to
let
Miss
Florence
be
with
Richards
when
she
choose
,
and
go
out
with
her
,
and
so
forth
.
<EOS>
tell
them
to
let
the
child
be
together
,
when
Richards
wish
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
iron
be
now
hot
,
and
Richards
strike
on
it
boldly
---
it
be
a
good
cause
and
she
be
bold
in
it
,
though
instinctively
afraid
of
MrDombey
---
<EOS>
request
that
Miss
Florence
may
be
send
down
then
and
there
,
to
make
friend
with
here
little
brother
.
  
<EOS>
She
feign
to
be
dandle
the
child
as
the
servant
retire
on
this
errand
,
but
she
think
that
she
see
Mr
Dombey
's
colour
change
;
that
the
expression
of
his
face
quite
alter
;
that
he
turn
,
hurriedly
,
as
if
to
gainsay
what
he
have
say
,
or
she
have
say
,
or
both
,
and
be
only
deter
by
very
shame
.
  
<EOS>
and
she
be
right
.
<EOS>
the
last
time
he
have
see
his
slight
child
,
there
have
be
that
in
the
sad
embrace
between
her
and
her
die
mother
,
which
be
at
once
a
revelation
and
a
reproach
to
him
.
<EOS>
let
him
be
absorb
as
he
would
in
the
Son
on
whom
he
build
such
high
hope
,
he
could
not
forget
that
closing
scene
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
forget
that
he
have
have
no
part
in
it
.
<EOS>
that
,
at
the
bottom
of
its
clear
depth
of
tenderness
and
truth
,
lie
those
two
figure
clasp
in
each
other
's
arm
,
while
he
stand
on
the
bank
above
them
,
look
down
a
mere
spectator
---
not
a
sharer
with
them
---
quite
shut
out
.
  
<EOS>
unable
to
exclude
these
thing
from
his
remembrance
,
or
to
keep
his
mind
free
from
such
imperfect
shape
of
the
meaning
with
which
they
be
fraught
,
as
be
able
to
make
themselves
visible
to
him
through
the
mist
of
his
pride
,
his
previous
feeling
of
indifference
towards
little
Florence
change
into
an
uneasiness
of
an
extraordinary
kind
.
<EOS>
He
almost
feel
as
if
she
watch
and
distrust
him
.
<EOS>
as
if
she
hold
the
clue
to
something
secret
in
his
breast
,
of
the
nature
of
which
he
be
hardly
inform
himself
.
<EOS>
as
if
she
have
an
innate
knowledge
of
one
jarring
and
discordant
string
within
him
,
and
her
very
breath
could
sound
it
.
  
<EOS>
His
feeling
about
the
child
have
be
negative
from
her
birth
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
conceive
an
aversion
to
her
:
it
have
not
be
worth
his
while
or
in
his
humour
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
be
a
positively
disagreeable
object
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
now
he
be
ill
at
ease
about
her
.
<EOS>
She
trouble
his
peace
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
prefer
to
put
her
idea
aside
altogether
,
if
he
have
know
how
.
<EOS>
perhaps
---
who
shall
decide
on
such
mystery
!
---
he
be
afraid
that
he
may
come
to
hate
her
.
  
<EOS>
when
little
Florence
timidly
present
herself
,
Mr
Dombey
stop
in
his
pacing
up
and
down
and
look
towards
her
.
<EOS>
have
he
look
with
great
interest
and
with
a
father
's
eye
,
he
may
have
read
in
her
keen
glance
the
impulse
and

"

<EOS>
the
dread
of
a
repulse
;
the
fear
of

bold

and
of
offend
him
;
the
pitiable
need
in
which

for
its
sorrow

<EOS>
but
he
see
nothing

<EOS>
He
see
her
pause
irresolutely
at
the

and
look
towards
him
;
and
he
see
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
"

he

,
"
come
in

<EOS>
what
be
the

afraid

"
  
<EOS>
She
come
in
;
and
after
glance
round
her
for
a
moment
with
an
uncertain
air
,
stand
press
her
small
hand
hard
together
,
close
within

.
  
<EOS>
"

coldly
.
<EOS>
"

"

"
have
you

"
  
<EOS>
the

that
stand
in

as
she
raise
them
quickly
to
his

,
be
freeze
by
the
expression
it
wear
.
<EOS>
She
look
down
again
,
and
put
out
her
tremble
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
take
it
loosely
in
his
own
,
and
stand
look
down
upon
her
for
a
moment
,
as
if
he
know
as
little
as
the
child
,
what
to
say
or
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
there

<EOS>
be
a
good

,
"
he
say
,
pat
her
on
the

,
and
regard
her
as
it
be
by
stealth
with
a
disturbed
and
doubtful
look
.
<EOS>
"
go
to
Richards
!
<EOS>
go

"
  
<EOS>
His
little
daughter
hesitate
for
another
instant
as
though
she
would
have
cling
about
him
still
,
or
have
some
linger
hope
that
he
may
raise
her
in
his
arm
and
kiss
her
.
<EOS>
She
look
up
in
his
face
once
more
.
<EOS>
He
think
how
like
her
expression
be
then
,
to
what
it
have
be
when
she
look
round
at
the
Doctor
---
that
night
---
and
instinctively
drop
her
hand
and
turn
away
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
difficult
to
perceive
that
Florence
be
at
a
great
disadvantage
in
her
father
's
presence
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
only
a
constraint
upon
the
child
's
mind
,
but
even
upon
the
natural
grace
and
freedom
of
her
action
.
<EOS>
still
Polly
persevere
with
all
the
well
heart
for
see
this
;
and
,
judging
of
Mr
Dombey
by
herself
,
have
great
confidence
in
the
mute
appeal
of
poor
little
Florence
's
mourning
dress
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
hard
indeed
,
"
think
Polly
,
"
if
he
take
only
to
one
little
motherless
child
,
when
he
have
another
,
and
that
a
girl
,
before
his
eye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
,
Polly
keep
her
before
his
eye
,
as
long
as
she
could
,
and
manage
so
well
with
little
Paul
,
as
to
make
it
very
plain
that
he
be
all
the
lively
for
his
sister
's
company
.
<EOS>
when
it
be
time
to
withdraw
up
stair
again
,
she
would
have
send
Florence
into
the
inner
room
to
say
good
-
night
to
her
father
,
but
the
child
be
timid
and
draw
back
:
and
when
she
urge
her
again
,
say
,
spread
her
hand
before
her
eye
,
as
if
to
shut
out
her
own
unworthiness
,
"
oh
no
,
no

<EOS>
He
do
not

<EOS>
He

"
  
<EOS>
the
little
altercation
between
them
have
attract
the
notice
of
Mr
Dombey
,
who
inquire
from
the
table
where
he
be
sit
at
his
wine
,
what
the
matter
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Florence
be
afraid
of
interrupting
,
Sir
,
if
she
come
in
to
say
good

night

say
Richards
.
  
<EOS>
"
It

not
matter
,
"
return
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
let
her
come

go
without

"
  
<EOS>
the
child
shrink
as
she
listen
---
and
be
go
before
her
humble
friend
look
round
again
.
  
<EOS>
however

Polly

<EOS>
"

with

evidently
intend

a

he
give
a
short
dry

well

<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
that
the

minded

secret
attraction

marvellous
and
adventurous
---
of
which
he
be
,
in

sort

a
distant
relation

by

have
greatly
encourage
the

attraction
in
the
nephew

and
that
everything
that
have
ever
be
put
before
the
boy
to
deter
him
from
a
life
of
adventure
,
have
have
the
usual
unaccountable
effect
of
sharpen
his
taste
for
it
.
<EOS>
this
be
invariable
.
<EOS>
It
would
seem
as
if
there
never
be
a
book
write
,
or
a
story
tell
,
expressly
with
the
object
of
keep
boy
on
shore

which
do
not
lure
and
charm
them
to

as
a
matter
of

<EOS>
but
an
addition
to
the
little
party
now
make
its
appearance
,
in
the
shape
of
a
gentleman
in
a
wide
suit
of
blue
,
with
a
hook
instead
of
a
hand
attach
to
his
right
wrist
;
very
bushy
black
eyebrow
;
and
a
thick
stick
in
his
left
hand
,
cover
all
over
(
like
his
nose
)
with
knob
.

He
wear
a
loose
black
silk
handkerchief
round
his
neck
,
and
such
a
very
large
coarse
shirt
collar
,
that
it
look
like
a
small
sail

<EOS>
He
be
evidently
the
person
for
whom
the
spare
wine

glass
be
intend
,
and
evidently
know
it
;
for
have
take
off
his
rough
outer
coat
,
and
hang
up
,
on
a
particular
pet
behind
the
door
,
such
a
hard
glaze
hat
as
a
sympathetic
person
's
head
may
ache
at
the
sight
of
,
and
which
leave
a
red
rim
round
his
own
forehead
as
if
he
have
be

a
tight
basin
,
he
bring
a
chair
to

the
clean

sit
himself
down

it

perhaps

looking
man
indeed

<EOS>
His
face

remarkable
for
a
brown
solidity

brighten
as
he
shake
hand
with
uncle

he
seem
to
be
of

<EOS>
He
be
so
perfectly
satisfied
both
with

his
reference
to

that
he
could
not
help
repeat
the

again
in

say
he
have
forget
'em
these
forty

I

observe

"
It
come
of
not

some
do

the
reflection
perhaps
remind
him
that
he
have
well
,
like
young
Norval

father

"
increase
his
store

<EOS>

at
any
rate
he
become
silent

and
remain
so
,
until
old
Sol
go
out
into
the
shop
to
light
it
up
,
when
he
turn
to
Walter

and
say
,
without
any
introductory
remark
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
could
make

it

go

"
<EOS>
Lord
,
how
that
clock
would
go

<EOS>
for
a
moment
or
two
he
seem
quite
lose
in
contemplate
the
pace
of
this
ideal
timepiece
,
and
sit
look
at
the
boy
as
if
his
face
be
the
dial
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
he
be
chockfull
of
science

he
observe

wave
his
hook
towards
the
stock

<EOS>
It
may
be
gather
from
these
remark
that
Captain
Cuttle
's
reverence
for
the
stock
of
instrument
be
profound
,
and
that
his
philosophy
know
little

no

invent
it

<EOS>
every

he
be
more
and
more
ardently

Miss

whose
devotion
be
so

by
Mr

that
he
begin
to
regard
her
as
a
woman
of
great
natural
good
sense
,
whose
feeling
do
her
credit
and
deserved
encouragement

<EOS>
He
be
so
lavish
of
this
condescension

that
he
not
only
bow
to
her
,
in
a
particular
manner
,
on
several
occasion
,
but
even
entrust
such
stately
recognition
of
her
to
his

as
"

speciality

<EOS>
Miss

be
often
in
the
habit

assure
Mrs
Chick
,
that
"
nothing
could
exceed
her
interest
in
all
connect
with
the
development
of
that
sweet
child
;
"
and
an
observer
of
Miss
Tox
's
proceeding
may
have
infer
so
much
without
declaratory
confirmation
.
<EOS>
She
would
preside
over
the
innocent
repast
of
the
young
heir
,
with
ineffable
satisfaction
,
almost
with
an
air
of
joint
proprietorship
with
Richards
in
the
entertainment
.
<EOS>
at
the
little
ceremony
of
the
bath
and
toilette

she
assist
with
enthusiasm

<EOS>
the
administration
of
infantine
dose
of
physic
awaken
all
the
active
sympathy
of
her
character
;
and
be
on
one
occasion
secrete
in
a
cupboard
(
whither
she
have
flee
in
modesty
)
,
when
Mr
Dombey
be
introduce
into
the
nursery
by
his
sister
,
to
behold
his
son
,
in
the
course
of
preparation
for

,
take
a
short
walk
uphill
over
Richards

gown
,
in
a
short
and
airy
linen
jacket

<EOS>
Miss

be
so
transported
beyond
the
ignorant
present
as
to
be
unable
to
refrain
from
cry
out

"

Louisa

Mr

one
day

to
his

"
<EOS>
I
really
think
I
must
present
your
friend
with
some
little
token
,
on
the
occasion
of
Paul

christening
.
<EOS>
She
have
exert
herself
so
warmly
in
the
child
's
behalf
from
the
first
,
and
seem
to
understand
her
position
so
thoroughly
(
a
very
rare
merit
in
this
world
,
I
be
sorry
to
say
)
,
that
it
would
really
be
agreeable
to
me
to
notice
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
let
it
be
no
detraction
from
the
merit
of
Miss
Tox
,
to
hint
that
in
Mr
Dombey
's
eye
,
as
in
some
other
that
occasionally
see
the
light
,
they
only
achieve
that
mighty
piece
of
knowledge
,
the
understanding
of
their
own
position
,
who
show
a
fitting
reverence
for
his
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
so
much
their
merit
that
they
know
themselves
,
as
that
they
know
him
,
and
bow
low
before
him

<EOS>
"
My

justice

I
believe
if
there

three

in

she

all
I
can

be
that
anything
you
give
Miss
Tox
will
be
hoard

prize

I
be
sure

like
a
relic

there
be
a
way

my

of
show
your
sense
of
Miss

still
more
flattering

objection

I
have

very
solemn

me

I

what

more

add
Mrs

with
increase
dignity

to
the
window

back
again

<EOS>
"
It
be
not

he
say
(
Mrs
Chick
have
nail
her
colour
to
the
mast
,
and
repeat
"
I
know
it
be
not
,
"
but
he
take
no
notice
of
it

that
there
be
many
person
who
,
suppose
that
I
recognise
any
claim
at
all
in
such
a
case
,
have
a
claim
upon
me
superior
to
Miss
Tox
's
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
I
recognise
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
Paul
and
myself
will
be
able
,
when
the
time
come
,
to
hold
our
own
---
the
house
,
in
other
word
,
will
be
able
to
hold
its
own
,
and
maintain
its
own
,
and
hand
down
its
own
of
itself
,
and
without
any
such
common
-
place
aid
.
<EOS>
the
kind
of
foreign
help
which
people
usually
seek
for
their
child
,
I
can
afford
to
despise
;
be
above
it
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
so
that
Paul
's
infancy
and
childhood
pass
away
well
,
and
<EOS>
I
see
him
become
qualified
without
waste
of
time
for
the
career
on
which
he
be
destine
to
enter
,
I
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
He
will
make
what
powerful
friend
he
please
in
after
-
life
,
when
he
be
actively
maintain
---
and
extend
,
if
that
be
possible
---
the
dignity
and
credit
of
the
Firm
.
<EOS>
until
then
,
I
be
enough
for
him
,
perhaps
,
and
all
in
all
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
wish
that
people
should
step
in
between
us
.
<EOS>
I
would
much
rather
show
my
sense
of
the
obliging
conduct
of
a
deserve
person
like
your
friend
.
<EOS>
therefore
let
it
be
so
;
and
your
husband
and
myself
will
do
well
enough
for
the
other
sponsor
,
I
dare
say
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
these
remark
,
deliver
with
great
majesty
and
grandeur
,
Mr
Dombey
have
truly
reveal
the
secret
feeling
of
his
breast
.
<EOS>
an
indescribable
distrust
of
anybody
step
in
between
himself
and
his
son
;
a
haughty
dread
of
have
any
rival
or
partner
in
the
boy
's
respect
and
deference
;
a
sharp
misgiving
,
recently
acquire
,
that
he
be
not
infallible
in
his
power
of
bend
and
bind
human
will
;
as
sharp
a
jealousy
of
any
second
check
or
cross
;
these
be
,
at
that
time
,
the
master
key
of
his
soul
.
<EOS>
in
all
his
life
,
he
have
never
make
a
friend
.
<EOS>
His
cold
and
distant
nature
have
neither
seek
one
nor
find
one
.
<EOS>
and
now
when
that
nature
concentrate
its
whole
force
so
strongly
on
a
partial
scheme
of
parental
interest
and
ambition
,
it
seem
as
if
its
icy
current
,
instead
of
be
release
by
this
influence
,
and
run
clear
and
free
,
have
thaw
for
but
an
instant
to
admit
its
burden
,
and
then
freeze
with
it
into
one
unyielding
block
.
  
<EOS>
elevate
thus
to
the
godmothership
of
little
Paul
,
<EOS>
in
virtue
of
her
insignificance
,
Miss
Tox
be
from
that
hour
choose
and
appoint
to
office
;
and
Mr
Dombey
further
signify
his
pleasure
that
the
ceremony
,
already
long
delay
,
should
take
place
without
further
postponement
.
<EOS>
His
sister
,
who
have
be
far
from
anticipate
so
signal
a
success
,
withdraw
as
soon
as
she
could
,
to
communicate
it
to
her
good
of
friend
;
and
Mr
Dombey
be
leave
alone
in
his
library
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
anything
but
solitude
in
the
nursery
;
for
there
,
Mrs

and
Miss

be
enjoy
a
social
evening

so
much
to
the
disgust
of
Miss
Susan
Nipper
,
that
that
young
lady
embrace
every
opportunity
of
make
wry
face
behind
the
door
.
<EOS>
Her
feeling
be
so
much
excited
on
the
occasion
,
that
she
find
it
indispensable
to
afford
them
this
relief
,
even
without
have
the
comfort
of
any
audience
or
sympathy
whatever
.
<EOS>
as
the

errant

savage
place
where
there
be
no
probability

ever

so
do
Miss
Susan
Nipper
curl
her
snub
nose
into
drawer

wardrobe
,
put
away
wink
of
disparagement
in
cupboards
,
shed
derisive
squint
into

some

before

<EOS>
the
very
wedding
look
dismal
as
they

in

<EOS>
the
bride

<EOS>
over
the
fireplace
be
a

and
Mr

,
skim
the
literary
portion
of
it
aloud
,
by
way
of
enliven
the
company

read
the
reference
to
Mrs

tomb
in

before

<EOS>
after
another
cold
interval

a
wheezy
little

appropriate

if

<EOS>
here
they
wait
some
little
time
while
the
marriage
party
enrol
themselves
;
and
meanwhile
the
wheezy
little
pew

opener
---
partly
in
consequence
of
her
infirmity
,
and
partly
that
the
marriage
party
may
not
forget
her
---
go
about
the
building
cough
like
a
grampus

<EOS>
presently
the
clerk
(
the
only
cheerful

looking
object
there
,
and
be
an
undertaker

come
up
with
a
jug
of
warm
water

and
say
something
,
as
he
pour
it
into
the
font
,
about
take
the
chill
off
;
which
million
of
gallon
boil
hot
could
not
have
do
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
then
the
clergyman
,
an
amiable
and
mild
-
look
young
curate
,
but
obviously
afraid
of
the
baby
,
appear
like
the
principal
character
in
a
ghost

story
,
"
a
tall
figure
all
in
white
;
"
at
sight
of
whom
Paul
rent
the

with
his
cry

and
never
leave
again
till
he

take
out
black

<EOS>
even
when
that
event
have
happen

to
the
great
relief

he
be
hear
under

portico
,
during
the
rest
of
the
ceremony
,
now
fainter
,
now
loud
,
now
hush
,
now
burst
forth
again
with
an
irrepressible
sense
of
his
wrong

<EOS>
this
so
distract
the
attention
of
the
two
lady
,
that
Mrs
Chick
be
constantly
deploy
into
the
centre
aisle
,
to
send
out
message
by
the
pew

opener
,
while
Miss
Tox
keep
her
prayer
-
book
open
at
the
Gunpowder
Plot
,
and
occasionally
read
response
from
that
service
.
  
<EOS>
during
the
whole
of
these
proceeding
,
Mr
Dombey
remain
as
impassive
and
gentlemanly
as
ever
,
and
perhaps
assist
in
make
it
so
cold
,
that
the
young
curate
smoke
at
the
mouth
as
he
read
.
<EOS>
the
only
time
that
he
unbend
his
visage
in
the
least
,
be
when
the
clergyman
,
in
deliver
(
very
unaffectedly
and
simply
)
the
closing
exhortation
,
relative
to
the
future
examination
of
the
child
by
the
sponsor
,
happen
to
rest
his
eye
on
Mr
Chick
;
and
then
Mr
Dombey
may
have
be
see
to
express
by
a
majestic
look
,
that
he
would
like
to
catch
him
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
well
for
Mr
Dombey
,
if
he
have
think
of
his
own
dignity
a
little
less
;
and
have
think
of
the
great
origin
and
purpose
of
the
ceremony
in
which
he
take
so
formal
and
so
stiff
<EOS>
a
part
,
a
little
more
.
<EOS>
His
arrogance
contrast
strangely
with
its
history
.
  
<EOS>
when
it
be
all
over
,
he
again
give
his
arm
to
Miss
Tox
,
and
conduct
her
to
the
vestry
,
where
he
inform
the
clergyman
how
much
pleasure
it
would
have
give
him
to
have
solicit
the
honour
of
his
company
at
dinner
,
but
for
the
unfortunate
state
of
his
household
affair

not

they
get
into
the
carriage
again

bleak

<EOS>
there
they
find
Mr
Pitt
turn
up
his
nose
at
a
cold
collation
,
set
forth
in
a
cold
pomp
of
glass

silver

and
look
more
like
a
dead

a
social
refreshment

on
their
arrival

Mr

into

in

to
a
chandler

but
lunch
have
render
her

the
charitable
Grinders

<EOS>
the
youth
of

street
could
not
endure
it

<EOS>
no
young
vagabond
could
be
bring
to
bear
its
contemplation
for
a
moment
,
without
throw
himself
upon
the
unoffending
wearer
,
and
do
him
a
mischief
.
<EOS>
His
social
existence
have
be
more
like
that
of
an
early
Christian
,
than
an
innocent
child
of
the
nineteenth
century
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
stone
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
overthrow
into
gutter
;
bespatter
with
mud
;
violently
flatten
against
post
.
<EOS>
entire
stranger
to
his
person
have
lift
his
yellow
cap
off
his
head
and
cast
it
to
the
wind
.
<EOS>
His
leg
have
not
only
undergo
verbal
criticism
and
reviling
,
but
have
be
handle
and
pinch
.
<EOS>
that
very
morning
,
he
have
receive
a
perfectly
unsolicited
black
eye
on
his
way
to
the
Grinders
'
establishment
,
and
have
be
punish
for
it
by
the
master

a
superannuated
old

of
savage
disposition
,
who
have
be
appoint
schoolmaster
because
he
do
not
know
anything
,
and
be
not
fit
for
anything
,
and
for
whose
cruel
cane
all
chubby
little

a
perfect
fascination

<EOS>
thus
it
fall
out
that
Biler
,
on
his
way
home
,
seek
unfrequented
path
;
and
slink
along
by
narrow

to
avoid
his
tormentor

<EOS>
be
compel
to
emerge
into
the
main
road
,
his
ill
fortune
bring
him
at
last
where
a
small
party
of
boy

head

a
ferocious
young
butcher
,
be
lie
in
wait
for
any
mean
of
pleasurable
excitement
that
may
happen

<EOS>
these
,
find
a
charitable
Grinder
in
the

them

unaccountably
deliver
over

as
it

into
their

set
up
a
general

upon
him

She

up
the
street

of

<EOS>
It
be
a

more
a

and
there
be
no

but
herself
and
the
old
woman

"
You

the

shed
tear
of
delight
on
hear
this

and
accompany
the
old

willingly
;
though
she
could
not
help
glance
at
her
face
as
they
go
along

particularly
at
that
industrious
mouth

and
wonder
whether
Bad

<EOS>
They

but
have
go
by
some
very
uncomfortable
place
,
such
as
brick
-
field
and
tile
-
yard
,
when
the
old
woman
turn
down
a
dirty
lane
,
where
the
mud
lie
in
deep
black
rut
in
the
middle
of
the
road

She
stop
before
a
shabby
little
house

as
closely
shut
up

house

where
there

great
heap
of
rag

different
colour
lie
on

floor

a
heap
of
bone

a
heap
of

cinder

become
so
terrified
that

stricken
speechless

<EOS>
the

threat

the
dread
of

offence
;
and
the
habit
,
unusual
to
a

almost
natural
to
Florence
now
,
of
be
quiet
,
and
repress
what

Florence

as
fast

all

a
frightened
eye

Humph

she

,
run
her
eye
over

slight
figure

<EOS>
poor
little
Florence
take
them
off
with
equal
alacrity
,
only
too
glad
to
have
any
more
mean
of
conciliation
about
her

<EOS>
the
old
woman
then
produce
some
wretched
substitute
from
the
bottom
of
the
heap
of
rag
,
which
she
turn
up
for
that
purpose
;
together
with
a
girl
's
cloak
,
quite
wear
out
and
very
old
;
and
the
crushed
remain
of
a
bonnet
that
have
probably
be
pick
up
from
some
ditch
or
dunghill
.
<EOS>
in
this
dainty
raiment
,
she
instruct
Florence
to
dress
herself
;
and
as
such
preparation
seem
a
prelude
to
her
release
,
the
child
comply
with
increase
readiness
,
if
possible
.
  
<EOS>
in
hurriedly
put
on
the
bonnet
,
if
that
may
be
call
a
bonnet
which
be
more
like

pad
to
carry
load
on

she
catch
it
in
her
hair
which
grow
luxuriantly
,
and
could
not

disentangle
it

<EOS>
Good
Mrs

whip
out
a
large
pair

scissor
,
and
fall
into
an
unaccountable
state
of
excitement

be

"
how

why

Lord

"
say
the
old
woman
,
ruffle
her
curl
with
a
furious
pleasure
,
"
anybody
but
me
would
have
have
'em
off
first
of
all

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
be
so
relieved
to
find
that
it
be
only
her
hair
and
not
her
head
which
Mrs
Brown
covet
,
that
she
offer
no
resistance
or
entreaty
,
and
merely
raise
her
mild
eye
towards
the
face
of
that
good
soul

"
if

not
once
have

say
Mrs

,
"
I
would
have
have
every
lock
of
it

<EOS>
She
be
far
away

she

far
away

<EOS>
Oho

Oho
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Brown
's
be
not
a
melodious
cry
,
but
,
accompany
with
a
wild
tossing
up
of
her
lean
arm
<EOS>
,
it
be
full
of
passionate
grief
,
and
thrill
to
the
heart
of
Florence
,
whom
it
frighten
more
than
ever
.
<EOS>
It
have
its
part
,
perhaps
,
in
save
her
curl
;
for
Mrs
Brown
,
after
hover
about
her
with
the
scissor
for
some
moment
,
like
a
new
kind
of
butterfly
,
bade
her
<EOS>
hide
them
under
the
bonnet
and
let
no
trace
of
them
escape
to
tempt
her
.
<EOS>
have
accomplish
this
victory
over
herself
,
Mrs
Brown
resume
her
seat
on
the
bone
,
and
smoke
a
very
short
black
pipe
,
mowing
and
mumble
all
the
time
,
as
if
she
be
eat
the
stem
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
pipe
be
smoke
out
,
she
give
the
child
a
rabbitskin
to
carry
,
that
she
may
appear
the
more
like
her
ordinary
companion
,
and
tell
her
that
she
be
now
go
to
lead
her
to
a
public
street
whence
she
could
inquire
her
way
to
her
friend
.
<EOS>
but
she
caution
her
,
with
threat
of
summary
and
deadly
vengeance
in
case
of
disobedience
,
not
to
talk
to
stranger
,
nor
to
repair
to
her
own
home
(
which
may
have
be
too
near
for
Mrs
Brown
's
convenience
)
,
but
to
her
father
's
office
in
the
City
;
also
to
wait
at
the
street
corner
where
she
would
be
leave
,
until
the
clock
strike
three
.
<EOS>
these
direction
Mrs
brown
enforce
with
assurance
that
there
would
be
potent
eye
and
ear
in
her
employment
cognizant
of
all
she
do
;
and
these
direction
Florence
promise
faithfully
and
earnestly
to
observe
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
,
Mrs
Brown
,
issue
forth
,
conduct
her
changed
and
rag
little
friend
through
a
labyrinth
of
narrow
street
and
lane
and
alley
,
which
emerge
,
after
a
long
time
,
upon
a
stable
yard
,
with
a
gateway
at
the
end
,
whence
the
roar
of
a
great
thoroughfare
make
itself
audible
.
<EOS>
point
out
this
gateway
,
and
inform
Florence
that
when
the
clock
strike
three
she
be
to
go
to
the
left
,
Mrs
Brown
,
after
make
a
parting
grasp
at
her
hair
which
seem
involuntary
and
quite
beyond
her
own
control
,
tell
her
she
know
what
to
do
,
and
bade
her
go
and
do
it
:
remember
that
she
be
watch
.
  
<EOS>
with
a
light
heart
,
but
still
sore
afraid
,
Florence
feel
herself
release
,
and
trip
off
to
the
corner
.
<EOS>
when
she
reach
it
,
she
look
back
and
see
the
head
of
Good
Mrs
Brown
peep
out
of
the
low
wooden
passage
,
where
she
have
issue
her
parting
injunction
;
likewise
the
first
of
Good
Mrs
Brown
shake
towards
her
.
<EOS>
but
though
she
often
look
back
afterwards
---
every
minute
,
at
least
,
in
her
nervous
recollection
of
the
old
woman
---
she
could
not
see
her
again
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
remain
there
,
look
at
the
bustle
in
the
street
,
and
more
and
more
bewilder
by
it
;
and
in
the
meanwhile
the
clock
appear
to
have
make
up
their
mind
never
to
strike
three
any
more
.
<EOS>
at
last
the
steeple
ring
out
three
o'clock
;
there
be
one
close
by
,
so
she
could
not
be
mistake
;
and
<EOS>
---
after
often
look
over
her
shoulder
,
and
often
go
a
little
way
,
and
as
often
come
back
again
,
lest
the
all
-
powerful
spy
of
Mrs
Brown
should
take
offence
---
she
hurry
off
,
as
fast
as
she
could
in
her
slipshod
shoe
,
hold
the
rabbit
-
skin
tight
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
all
she
know
of
her
father
's
office
be
that
they
belong
to
Dombey
and
Son
,
and
that
that
be
a
great
power
belong
to
the
City
.
<EOS>
so
she
could
only
ask
the
way
to
Dombey
and
Son
's
in
the
City
;
and
as
she
generally
make
inquiry
of
child
---
be
afraid
to
ask
grown
people
---
she
get
very
little
satisfaction
indeed
.
<EOS>
but
by
dint
of
ask
her
way
to
the
City
after
a
while
,
and
drop
the
rest
of
her
inquiry
for
the
present
,
she
really
do
advance
,
by
slow
degree
,
towards
the
heart
of
that
great
region
which
be
govern
by
the
terrible
Lord
Mayor
.
  
<EOS>
tired
of
walk
,
repulse
and
push
about
,
stun
by
the
noise
and
confusion
,
anxious
for
her
brother
and
the
nurse
,
terrify
by
what
she
have
undergo
,
and
<EOS>
the
prospect
of
encounter
her
angry
father
in
such
an
altered
state
;
perplex
and
frighten
alike
by
what
have
pass
,
and
what
be
pass
,
and
what
be
yet
before
her
;
Florence
go
upon
her
weary
way
with
tearful
eye
,
and
once
or
twice
could
not
help
stop
to
ease
her
burst
heart
by
cry
bitterly
.
<EOS>
but
few
people
notice
her
at
those
time
,
in
the
garb
she
wear
:
or
if
they
do
,
believe
that
she
be
tutor
to
excite
compassion
,
and
pass
on
.
<EOS>
Florence
,
too
,
call
to
her
aid
all
the
firmness
and
self
-
reliance
of
a
character
that
her
sad
experience
have
prematurely
form
and
try
:
and
keep
the
end
she
have
in
view
steadily
before
her
,
steadily
pursue
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
full
two
hour
later
in
the
afternoon
than
when
she
have
start
on
this
strange
adventure
,
when
escape
from
the
clash
and
clangour
of
a
narrow
street
full
of
cart
and
waggon
,
she
peep
into
a
kind
of
wharf
or
landing
-
place
upon
the
river

side
,
where
there
be
a
great
many
package
,
cask
,
and
box
,
strew
about
;
a
large
pair
of
wooden
scale

and
a
little
wooden
house
on
wheel
,
outside
of
which

at
the
neighbouring
mast
and

,
a
stout
man

with
his
pen
behind

Walter

put
it
on
the
little
foot
as

Prince

<EOS>
He
hang
the
rabbit

give
the

and
feel
,
not
to

like
Richard

<EOS>
so
Walter
,
look
immensely
fierce
,
lead
off
Florence
,
look
very
happy
;
and
they
go
arm
-
in
-
arm
along
the
street
,
perfectly
indifferent
to
any
astonishment
that
their
appearance
may
or
do
excite
by
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
grow
dark
and
foggy
,
and
begin
to
rain
too
;
but
they
care
nothing
for
this
:
be
both
wholly
absorb
in
the
late
adventure
of
Florence
,
which
she
relate
with
the
innocent
good
faith
and
confidence
of
her
year
,
while
Walter
listen
as
if
,
far
from
the
mud
and
grease
of
Thames
Street
,
they
be
ramble
alone
among
the
broad
leave
and
tall
tree
of
some
desert
island
in
the
tropic
---
as
he
very
likely
fancy
,
for
the
time
,
they
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
we
far
to
go
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Florence
at
last
,
lift
up
her
eye
to
her
companion
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah

<EOS>
by

Walter

stop

see
;
where

<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
I
know

there

<EOS>
Mr

home
long

<EOS>
I
suppose

suppose
I
take
you
to
my
uncle

,
where
I
live

it
be
very
near
here

and
go
to
your
house
in
a
coach
to
tell
them
you
be
safe
,
and
bring
you
back
some
clothe
.
<EOS>
will
not
that
be
good
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so

answer
Florence

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
not
you
?
<EOS>
what
do
you
think

"
  
<EOS>
as
they
stand
deliberate
in
the
street
,
a
man
pass
them
,
who
glance
quickly
at
Walter
as
he
go
by
,
as
if
he
recognise
him
;
but
seem
to
correct
that
first
impression
,
he
pass
on
without
stop
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
think
it
be
Mr
Carker
,
"

Walter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Carker
in
our
House

<EOS>
not
Carker

Mr

<EOS>
"
be
that
Walter
Gay

"
say
the
other
,
stop
and
return
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
believe
it
,
with
such
a
strange
companion
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
he
stand
near
a
lamp
,
listen
with
surprise
to
Walter
's
hurried
explanation
,
he
present
a
remarkable
contrast
to
the
two
youthful
figure
arm
-
in
-
arm
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
old
,
but
his
hair
be
white
;
his
body
be
bent
,
or
bow
as
if
by
the
weight
of
some
great
trouble
:
and
there
be
deep
line
in
his
worn
and
melancholy
face
.
<EOS>
the
fire
of
his
eye
,
the
expression
of
his
feature
,
the
very
voice
in
which
he
speak
,
be
all
subdue
and
quench
,
as
if
the
spirit
within
him
lie
in
ashe
.
<EOS>
He
be
respectably
,
though
very
plainly
dress
,
in
black
;
but
his
clothe
,
mould
to
the
general
character
of
his
figure
,
seem
to
shrink
and
abase
themselves
upon
him
,
and
to
join
in
the
sorrowful
solicitation
which
the
whole
man
from
head
to
foot
express
,
to
be
leave
unnoticed
,
and
alone
in
his
humility
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
his
interest
in
youth
and
hopefulness
be
not
extinguish
with
the
other
ember
of
his
soul
<EOS>
,
for
he
watch
the
boy
's
earnest
countenance
as
he
speak
with
unusual
sympathy
,
though
with
an
inexplicable
show
of
trouble
and
compassion
,
which
escape
into
his
look
,
however
hard
he
strove
to
hold
it
prisoner
.
<EOS>
when
Walter
,
in
conclusion
,
put
to
him
the
question
he
have
put
to
Florence
,
he
still
stand
glance
at
him
with
the
same
expression
,
as
if
he
have
read
some
fate
upon
his
face
,
mournfully
at
variance
with
its
present
brightness
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
advise
,
Mr
Carker
?
"
say
Walter
,
smile
.
<EOS>
"
You

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
your
own
idea
be
the
good

he
answer
:
look
from
Florence
to
Walter
,
and
back
again
.
  
<EOS>
"

brighten
with

Mr

"
say
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
He
merely
shake
him
by
the
hand
in
answer
;
he
seem
in
a
manner
ashamed
and
afraid
even
to
do
that
;

bid
him
good
night
,
and
advise

to
make

turn

after
a
minute

pause

during
which
he
have
be
look
down
upon
the
gentle
patient
little

move
on

Florence

though
very
tired

laughingly
decline
the
proposal

lest
he
should
let

I

as
to
the

befel
Miss

I
regard
that

<EOS>
polly
move
towards
the
door
,
with
Florence
hold
to
her
dress
,
and
cry
to
her
in
the
most
pathetic
manner
not
to
go
away
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
dagger
in
the
haughty
father

heart
,
an
arrow
in
his
brain
,
to
see
how
the
flesh
and
blood
he
could
not
disown
,
clung
to
this
obscure
stranger
,
and
he
sit
by
.
<EOS>
not
that
he
care
to
whom
his
daughter
turn
,
or
from
whom
turn
away

<EOS>
the
swift
sharp
agony
strike
through
him

as
he
think
of
what
his

may
do

<EOS>
His
son
cry
lustily
that
night
,
at
all
event

<EOS>
Sooth
to
say
,
poor
Paul
have
well
reason
for
his
tear
than
son
of
that
age
often
have

for
he
have
lose
his

<EOS>
his
first

so
far
as

by
a
stroke
as
sudden
as
that
natural
affliction

darken
the

at

blow

sometimes
as
many
as
five

and

twenty
people
attend
service
on
a
Sunday
.
<EOS>
the
Princess
's
arm
be
also
there
,
and
much
resort
to
by
splendid
footman
.
<EOS>
a
sedan
chair
be
keep
inside
the
railing
before
the
Princess
's
arm
,
but
it
have
never
come
out
within
the
memory
of
man
;
and
on
fine
morning
,
the
top
of
every
rail
(
there
be
eight
-
and
-
forty
,
as
Miss
Tox
have
often
count
)
be
decorate
with
a
pewter
-
pot
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
another
private
house
besides
Miss
Tox
be
in
Princess
's
place
:
not
to
mention
an
immense
pair
of
gate
,
with
an
immense
pair
of
lion
-
head
knocker
on
them
,
which
be
never
open
by
any
chance
,
and
be
suppose
to
constitute
a
disused
entrance
to
somebody
's
stable
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
there
be
a
smack
of
stabling
in
the
air
of
Princess
's
place
;
and
Miss
Tox
's
bedroom
(
which
be
at
the
back
)
command
a
vista
of
Mews
,
where
hostler
,
at
whatever
sort
of
work
engage
,
be
continually
accompany
themselves
with
effervescent
noise
;
and
where
the
most
domestic
and
confidential
garment
of
coachman
and
their
wife
and
family
,
usually
hang
,
like
Macbeth
's
banner
,
on
the
outward
wall

<EOS>
at
this
other
private
house
in
Princess

place
,
tenant
by
a
retire
butler
who
have
marry
a
housekeeper
,
apartment
be
let
Furnished
,
to
a
single
gentleman
:
to
wit
,
a
wooden
-
featured
,
blue
-
faced
Major
,
with
his
eye
start
out
of
his
head
,
in
whom
Miss
Tox
recognise
,
as
she
herself
express
it
,
"
something
so
truly
military
;
"
and
between
whom
and
herself
,
an
occasional
interchange
of
newspaper
and
pamphlet
,
and
such
platonic
dalliance
,
be
effect
through
the
medium
of
a
dark
servant
of
the
Major
's
,
who
Miss
Tox
be
quite
content
to
classify
as
a
"
native
,
"
without
connect
him
with
any
geographical
idea
whatever
.
   
<EOS>
perhaps
there
never
be
a
small
entry
and
staircase
,
than
the
entry
and
staircase
of
Miss
Tox
's
house
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
take
altogether
,
from
top
to
bottom
,
it
be
the
most
inconvenient
little
house
in
England
,
and
the
crooked
;
but
then
,
Miss
Tox
say
,
<EOS>
what
a
situation
!
<EOS>
there
be
very
little
daylight
to
be
get
there
in
the
winter
:
<EOS>
no
sun
at
the
good
of
time
<EOS>
:
air
be
out
of
the
question
,
and
traffic
be
wall
out
.
<EOS>
still
Miss
Tox
say
,
think
of
the
situation
!
<EOS>
so
say
the
blue
-
faced
Major
,
whose
eye
be
start
out
of
his
head
:
who
glory
in
Princess
's
place
:
and
who
delight
to
turn
the
conversation
at
his
club
,
whenever
he
could
,
to
something
connect
with
some
of
the
great
people
in
the
great
street
round
the
corner
,
that
he
may
have
the
satisfaction
of
say
they
be
his
neighbour
.
  
<EOS>
the
dingy
tenement
inhabit
by
Miss
Tox
be
her
own
;
have
be
devise
and
bequeath
to
her
by
the
deceased
owner
of
the
fishy
eye
in
the
locket
,
of
whom
a
miniature
portrait
,
with
a
powdered
head
and
a
pigtail
,
balance
the
kettleholder
on
opposite
side
of
the
parlour
fireplace
.
<EOS>
the
great
part
of
the
furniture
be
of
the
powder
-
head
and
pig
-
tail
period
:
comprise
a
platewarmer
,
always
languish
and
sprawl
its
four
attenuated
bow
leg
in
somebody
's
way
;
and
an
obsolete
harpsichord
,
illuminate
round
the
maker
's
name
with
a
paint
garland
of
sweet
pea
.
  
<EOS>
although
Major
Bagstock
have
arrive
at
what
be
call
in
polite
literature
,
the
grand
meridian
of
life
,
and
be
proceed
on
his
journey
down
-
hill
with
hardly
any
throat
,
and
a
very
rigid
pair
of
jaw
-
bones
,
and
long
-
flap
elephantine
ear
,
and
his
eye
and
complexion
in
the
state
of
artificial
excitement
already
mention
,
he
be
mightily
proud
of
awaken
an
interest
in
Miss
Tox
,
and
tickle
his
vanity
with
the
fiction
that
she
be
a
splendid
woman
,
who
have
her
eye
on
him
.
<EOS>
this
he
have
several
time
hint
at
the
club
:
in
connexion
with
little
jocularity
,
of
which
old
Joe
Bagstock
,
old
Joey
Bagstock
,
old
J
Bagstock
,
old
Josh
Bagstock
,
or
so
forth
,
be
the
perpetual
theme
:
<EOS>
it
be
,
as
it
be
,
the
Major
's
stronghold
and
donjon
-
keep
of
light
humour
,
to
be
on
the
most
familiar
term
with
his
own
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
Joey
B
,
Sir
,
"
the
Major
would
say
,
with
a
flourish
of
his
walking
-
stick
,
"
be
worth
a
dozen
of
you
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
a
few
more
of
the
Bagstock
breed
among
you
,
Sir
,
you
would
be
none
the
bad
for
it
.
<EOS>
Old
Joe
,
Sir
,
nee
not
look
far
for
a
wife
even
now
,
if
he
be
on
the
look

out
;
but
he
be
hard

,
Sir

be
Joe
---
he
be
tough
,
Sir
,
tough
,
and
de

"
<EOS>
after
such
a
declaration
wheezing
sound
would
be
hear
;
and
the
Major
's
blue
would
deepen
into
purple
,
while
his
eye
strain
and
start
convulsively
.
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
his
very
liberal
laudation
of
himself
,
however
,
the
Major
be
selfish
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
doubt
whether
there
ever
be
a
more
entirely
selfish
person
at
heart
;
or
at
stomach
be
perhaps
a
well
expression
,
see
that
he
be
more
decidedly
endow
with
that
latter
organ
than
with
the
former
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
idea
of
be
overlook
or
slight
by
anybody
;
least
of
all
,
have
he
the
remote
comprehension
of
be
over
-
look
and
slight
by
Miss
Tox
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
,
Miss
Tox
,
as
it
appear
,
forget
him
---
gradually
forget
him
.
<EOS>
She
begin
to
forget
him
soon
after
her
discovery
of
the
Toodle
family
.
<EOS>
She
continue
to
forget
him
up
to
the
time
of
the
christening
.
<EOS>
She
go
on
forget
him
with
compound
interest
after
that
.
<EOS>
something
or
somebody
have
supersede
him
as
a
source
of
interest

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
as
Miss

with

disappear
from
Princess

the
Major
stand
look
after
her
with
a
bluer
face
than
ever

mutter
and
growl
some
not
at
all
complimentary
remark

<EOS>
"
why

the
Major
,
roll
his
lobster
eye
round

round
Princess

apostrophize
its
fragrant
air

six
month

Bagstock
walk
on
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
meaning
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
Major
decide
,
after
some
consideration
,
that
it
mean
man
-
trap
;
that
it
mean
plot
and
snare
;
that
Miss

be
dig
pitfall

<EOS>
but
you
will
not

the

<EOS>
"
He

"
<EOS>
over
which
reflection
he
chuckle
for
the
rest
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
but
still
,
when
that
day
and
many
other
day
be
go
and
past
,
it
seem
that
Miss
Tox
take
no
heed
whatever
of
the
Major
,
and
think
nothing
at
all
about
him
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
will
not
,
once
upon
a
time
,
to
look
out
at
one
of
her
little
dark
window
by
accident
,
and
blushingly
return
the
Major
's
greeting
;
but
now
,
she
never
give
the
Major
a
chance
,
and
care
nothing
at
all
whether
he
look
over
the
way
or
not
.
<EOS>
other
change
have
come
to
pass
too
.
<EOS>
the
Major
,
stand
in
the
shade
of
his
own
apartment
,
could
make
out
that
an
air
of
great
smartness
have
recently
come
over
Miss
Tox
's
house
;
that
a
new
cage
with
gilded
wire
have
be
provide
for
the
ancient
little
canary
bird
;
that
diver
ornament
,
cut
out
of
colour
card
-
board
and
paper
,
seem
to
decorate
the
chimney
-
piece
and
table
;
that
a
plant
or
two
have
suddenly
spring
up
in
the
window
;
that
Miss
Tox
occasionally
practise
on
the
harpsichord
,
whose
garland
of
sweet
pea
be
always
display
ostentatiously
,
crown
with
the
Copenhagen
and
Bird
Waltzes
in
a
Music
Book
of
Miss
Tox
's
own
copying
.
  
<EOS>
over
and
above
all
this
,
Miss
Tox
have
long
be
dress
with
uncommon
care
and
elegance
in
slight
mourning
.
<EOS>
but
this
help
the
Major
out
of
his
difficulty
;
and
he
determine
within
himself
that
she
have
come
into
a
small
legacy
,
and
grow
proud
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
on
the
very
next
day
after
he
have
ease
his
mind
by
arrive
at
this
decision
,
that
the
Major
,
sit
at
his
breakfast
,
see
an
apparition
so
tremendous
and
wonderful
in
Miss
Tox
's
little
drawing
-
room
,
that
he
remain
for
some
time
root
to
his
chair
;
then
,
rush
into
the
next
room
,
return
with
a
double
-
barrelled
opera
-
glass
,
through
which
he
survey
it
intently
for
some
minute
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
Baby
,
Sir
,
"
say
the
Major
,
shut
up
the
glass
again
,
"
for
fifty
thousand
pound
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
Major
could
not
forget
it
.
<EOS>
He
could
do
nothing
but
whistle
,
and
stare
to
that
extent
,
that
his
eye
compare
with
what
they
now
become
,
have
be
in
former
time
quite
cavernous

<EOS>
to
all
other
intent
and
purpose
he
be
alone
in
Princess

place

<EOS>
Miss
Tox
have
cease
to
mind
what
he
do
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
be
black
as
well
as
blue
,
and
it
would
have
be
of
no
consequence
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
perseverance
with
which
she
walk
out
of
Princess

place
to
fetch
this
baby
and
its
nurse
,
and
walk
back
with
them
,
and
walk
home
with
them
again
,
and
continually
mount
guard
over
them
;
and
the
perseverance
with
which
she
nurse
it
herself
,
and
feed
it
,
and
play
with
it
,
and
freeze
its
young
blood
with
air
upon
the
harpsichord
;
be
extraordinary

<EOS>
at
about
this
same
period
,
too
,
she
be
seize
with
a
passion
for
look
at
a
certain
bracelet
;
also
with
a
passion
for
look
at
the
moon
,
of
which
she
would
take
long
observation
from
her
chamber
window
.
<EOS>
but
whatever
she
look
at
;
sun
,
moon
,
star
,
or
bracelet
;
she
look
no
more
at
the
Major
.
<EOS>
and
the
Major
whistle
,
and
stare
,
and
wonder
,
and
dodge
about
his
room
,
and
could
make
nothing
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
You

quite
win
my

Miss

Miss

take
the
little
Paul
in
her

make
his
cockade
perfectly

somehow
expect

almost
as
a

<EOS>
Miss

heave
a
deep
sigh

extremely

if

have
know
how
many
hope

venture

what
a
multitude
of
plan
and
speculation

rest
on
that
baby

hover

in
all
their
heterogeneous
confusion

round
the
puckered
cap

the
unconscious
little

then
would
he
have
recognise
,
among
the
crowd

some
few
ambitious
mote

he
perhaps
have
understand

falter
investment

More

<EOS>
on
the
downfall
and
banishment
of
Richards

put
into

:
as
a
Public

sometimes

when
no
individual

<EOS>
the
Commissioners
be
,
of
course
,
Mrs
Chick
and
Miss
Tox
:
who
devote
themselves
to
their
duty
with
such
astonishing
ardour
that
Major
Bagstock
have
every
day
some
new
reminder
of
his
be
forsake
,
while
Mr
Chick
,
bereft
of
domestic
supervision
,
cast
himself
upon
the
gay
world
,
dine
at
club
and
coffee
-
house
,
smelt
of
smoke
on
three
different
occasion
,
go
to
the
play
by
himself
,
and
in
short
,
loosen
(
as
Mrs
Chick
once
tell
him
)
every
social
bond
,
and
moral
obligation
.
  
<EOS>
yet
,
in
spite
of
his
early
promise
,
all
this
vigilance
and
care
could
not
make
little
Paul
a
thriving
boy
.
<EOS>
naturally
delicate
,
perhaps
,
he
pine
and
waste
after
the
dismissal
of
his
nurse
,
and
,
for
a
long
time
,
seem
but
to
wait
his
opportunity
of
glide
through
their
hand
,
and
seek
his
lose
mother
.
<EOS>
this
dangerous
ground
in
his
steeple
-
chase
towards
manhood
pass
,
he
still
find
it
very
rough
riding
,
and
be
grievously
beset
by
all
the
obstacle
in
his
course
.
<EOS>
every
tooth
be
a
break
-
neck
fence
,
and
every
pimple
in
the
measle
a
stone
wall
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
down
in
every
fit
of
the
hooping
-
cough
,
and
roll
upon
and
crush
by
a
whole
field
of
small
disease
,
that
come
troop
on
each
other

heel
to
prevent
his

up
again
.
<EOS>
some
bird
of
prey
get
into
his
throat
instead
of
the
thrush
;
and
the
very
chicken
turn
ferocious
---
if
they
have
anything
to
do
with
that
infant
malady
to
which
they
lend
their
name
---
worry
him
like
tiger
-
cat
.
  
<EOS>
the
chill
of
Paul
's
christening
have
strike
home
,
perhaps
to
some
sensitive
part
of
his
nature
,
which
could
not
recover
itself
in
the
cold
shade
of
his
father
;
but
he
be
an
unfortunate
child
from
that
day
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Wickam
often
say
she
never
see
a
dear
so
put
upon
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Wickam
be
a
waiter
's
wife
---
which
would
seem
equivalent
to
be
any
other
man
's
widow
---
whose
application
for
an
engagement
in
Mr
Dombey
's
service
have
be
favourably
consider
,
on
account
of
the
apparent
impossibility
of
her
have
any
follower
,
or
any
one
to
follow
;
and
who
,
from
within
a
day
or
two
of
Paul
's
sharp
weaning
,
have
be
engage
as
his
nurse
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Wickam
be
a
meek
woman
,
of
a
fair
complexion
,
with
her
eyebrow
always
elevated
,
and
her
head
always
droop
;
who
be
always
ready
to
pity
herself
,
or
to
be
pity
,
or
to
pity
anybody
else
;
and
who
have
a
surprising
natural
gift
of
view
all
subject
in
an
utterly
forlorn
and
pitiable
light
,
and
bring
dreadful
precedent
to
bear
upon
them
,
and
derive
the
great
consolation
from
the
exercise
of
that
talent
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
necessary
to
observe
,
that
no
touch
of
this
quality
ever
reach
the
magnificent
knowledge
of
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
remarkable
,
indeed
,
if
any
have
;
when
no
one
in
the
house
---
not
even
Mrs
Chick
or
Miss
Tox
---
dare
ever
whisper
to
him
that
there
have
,
on
any
one
occasion
,
be
the
least
reason
for
uneasiness
in
reference
to
little
Paul
.
<EOS>
He
have
settle
,
within
himself
,
that
the
child
must
necessarily
pass
through
a
certain
routine
of
minor
malady
,
and
that
the
sooner
he
do
so
the
well
.
<EOS>
if
he
could
have
buy
him
off
,
or
provide
a
substitute
,
as
in
the
case
of
an
unlucky
drawing
for
the
militia
,
he
would
have
be
glad
to
do
so
on
liberal
term
.
<EOS>
but
as
this
be
not
feasible
,
he
merely
wonder
,
in
his
haughty
manner
,
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
what
Nature
mean
by
it
;
and
comfort
himself
with
the
reflection
that
there
be
another
milestone
pass
upon
the
road
,
and
that
the
great
end
of
the
journey
lie
so
much
the
nearer
.
<EOS>
for
the
feeling
uppermost
in
his
mind
,
now
and
constantly
intensify
,
and
increase
in
it
as
Paul
grow
old
,
be
impatience
.
<EOS>
impatience
for
the
time
to
come
,
when
his
vision
of
their
united
consequence
and
grandeur
would
be
triumphantly
realize
.
  
<EOS>
some
philosopher
tell
us
that
selfishness
be
at
the
root
of
our
good
love
and
affection
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
's
young
child
be
,
from
the
beginning
,
so
distinctly
important
to
him
as
a
part
of
his
own
greatness
,
or
(
which
be
the
same
thing
)
of
the
greatness
of
Dombey
and
Son
,
that
there
be
no
doubt
his
parental
affection
may
have
be
easily
trace
,
like
many
a
goodly
super
-
structure
of
fair
fame
,
to
a
very
low
foundation
.
<EOS>
but
he
love
his
son
with
all
the
love
he
have
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
a
warm
place
in
his
frosty
heart
,
his
son
occupy
it
;
if
its
very
hard
surface
could
receive
the
impression
of
any
image
,
the
image
of
that
son
be
there
;
though
not
so
much
as
an
infant
,
or
as
a
boy
,
but
as
a
grown
man
---
the
"
Son
"
of
the
Firm
.
<EOS>
therefore
he
be
impatient
to
advance
into
the
future
,
and
to
hurry
over
the
intervene
passage
of
his
history
.
<EOS>
therefore
he
have
little
or
no
anxiety
about
them
,
in
spite
of
his
love
;
feel
as
if
the
boy
have
a
charm
life
,
and
must
become
the
man
with
whom
he
hold
such
constant
communication
in
his
thought
,
and
for
whom
he
plan
and
project
,
as
for
an
exist
reality
,
every
day
.
  
<EOS>
thus
Paul
grow
to
be
nearly
five
year
old
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
pretty
little
fellow
;
though
there
be
something
wan
and
wistful
in
his
small
face
,
that
give
occasion
to
many
significant
shake
of
Mrs
Wickam
's
head
,
and
many
long
-
draw
inspiration
of
Mrs
Wickam
's
breath
.
<EOS>
His
temper
give
abundant
promise
of
be
imperious
in
after
-
life
;
and
he
have
as
hopeful
an
apprehension
of
his
own
importance
,
and
the
rightful
subservience
of
all
other
thing
and
person
to
it
,
as
heart
could
desire
.
<EOS>
He
be
childish
and
sportive
enough
at
time
,
and
not
of
a
sullen
disposition
;
but
he
have
a
strange
,
old
-
fashioned
,
thoughtful
way
,
at
other
time
,
of
sit
brood
in
his
miniature
armchair
,
when
he
look
(
and
talk
)
like
one
of
those
terrible
little
being
in
the
fairy
tale
,
who
,
at
a
hundred
and
fifty
or
two
hundred
year
of
age
,
fantastically
represent
the
child
for
whom
they
have
be
substitute
.
<EOS>
He
would
frequently
be
stricken
with
this
precocious
mood
upstairs
in
the
nursery
;
and
would
sometimes
lapse
into
it
suddenly
,
exclaim
that
he
be
tired
:
even
while
play
with
Florence
,
or
drive
Miss
Tox
in
single
harness
.
<EOS>
but
at
no
time
do
he
fall
into
it
so
surely
,
as
when
,
his
little
chair
be
carry
down
into
his
father
's
room
,
he
sit
there
with
him
after
dinner
,
by
the
fire
.
<EOS>
They
be
the
strange
pair
at
such
a
time
that
ever
firelight
shone
upon
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
so
erect
and
solemn
,
gaze
at
the
blaze
;
his
little
image
,
with
an
old
,
old
face
,
peer
into
the
red
perspective
with
the
fix
and
rapt
attention
of
a
sage
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
entertain
complicate
worldly
scheme
and
plan
;
the
little
image
entertain
Heaven
know
what
wild
fancy
,
half

form
thought
,
and
wander
speculation
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
stiff
with
starch
and
arrogance
;
the
little
image
by
inheritance
,
and
in
unconscious
imitation
.
<EOS>
the
two
so
very
much
alike
,
and
yet
so
monstrously
contrast
.
  
<EOS>
on
one
of
these
occasion
,
when
they
have
both
be
perfectly
quiet
for
a
long
time
,
and
Mr
Dombey
only
know
that
the
child
be
awake
by
occasionally
glance
at
his
eye
,
where
the
bright
fire
be
sparkle
like
a
jewel
,
little
Paul
break
silence
thus
:
  
"
Papa
!
<EOS>
what
be
money
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
abrupt
question
have
such
immediate
reference
to
the
subject
of
Mr
Dombey
's
thought
,
that
Mr
Dombey
be
quite
disconcert
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
money
,
Paul
?
"
he
answer
.
<EOS>
"
money
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
the
child
,
lay
his
hand
upon
the
elbow
of
his
little
chair
,
and
turn
the
old
face
up
towards
Mr
Dombey
's
;
"
what
be
money
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
be
in
a
difficulty
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
like
to
give
him
some
explanation
involve
the
term
circulate
-
medium
,
currency
,
depreciation
of
currency
,
paper
,
bullion
,
rate
of
exchange
,
value
of
precious
metal
in
the
market
,
and
so
forth
;
but
look
down
at
the
little
chair
,
and
see
what
a
long
way
down
it
be
,
he
answer
:
"
gold
,
and
silver
,
and
copper
.
<EOS>
guinea

shilling
,
half

<EOS>
You

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes

I
know
what
they
be

"
say
Paul
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
that
,
Papa

<EOS>
I
mean
what
be
money
after
all
?
"
  
<EOS>
Heaven
and
Earth
<EOS>
,
how
old
his
face
be
as
he
turn
it
up
again
towards
his
father
's
!
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
money
after

"
say
Mr
Dombey
,
back
his
chair
a
little
,
that
he
may
the
well
gaze
in
sheer
amazement
at
the
presumptuous
atom
that
propound
such
an
inquiry
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
Papa
,
what
can
it
do
?
"
return
Paul
,
fold
his
arm
(
they
be
hardly
long
enough
to
fold
)
,
and
look
at
the
fire
,
and
up
at
him
,
and
at
the
fire
,
and
up
at
him
again
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
draw
his
chair
back
to
its
former
place
,
and
pat
him
on
the
head
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
know
well
by
-
and
-
by
,
my
man
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
money
,
Paul
,
can
do
anything
.
"
<EOS>
He
take
hold
of
the
little
hand
,
and
beat
it
softly
against
one
of
his
own
,
as
he
say
so
.
  
<EOS>
but
Paul
get
his
hand
free
as
soon
as
he
could
;
and
rub
it
gently
to
and
fro
on
the
elbow
of
his
chair
,
as
if
his
wit
be
in
the
palm
,
and
he
be
sharpen
it
---
and
look
at
the
fire
again
,
as
though
the
fire
have
be
his
adviser
and
prompter
---
<EOS>
repeat
,
after
a
short
pause
:
   
<EOS>
"
anything

Papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
anything

almost
,
"
say
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
anything
mean
everything
,
do
not
it

Papa
?
"
ask
his
son
:
not
observe
,
or
possibly
not
understand
,
the
qualification
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
include
it
:
<EOS>
yes
,
"
say
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
money
save
me
my
Mama
?
"
return
the
child
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
cruel
,
be
it
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
cruel
!
"
say
Mr
Dombey
,
settle
his
neckcloth
,
and
seem
to
resent
the
idea
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
a
good
thing
can
not
be
cruel

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
a
good
thing

can
do
anything
,
"
say
the
little
fellow
,
thoughtfully
,
as
he
look
back
at
the
fire
,
"
I
wonder
why
it
do
not
save
me
my
Mama
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
ask
the
question
of
his
father
this
time
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
have
see
,
with
a
child
's
quickness
,
that
it
have
already
make
his
father
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
but
he
repeat
the
thought
aloud
,
as
if
it
be
quite
an
old
one
to
him
,
and
have
trouble
him
very
much
;
and
sit
with
his
chin
rest
on
his
hand
,
still
cogitate
and
look
for
an
explanation
in
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
have
recover
from
his
surprise
,
not
to
say
his
alarm
(
for
it
be
the
very
first
occasion
on
which
the
child
have
ever
broach
the
subject
of
his
mother
to
him
,
though
he
have
have
him
sit
by
his
side
,
in
this
same
manner
,
evening
after
evening
)
,
expound
to
him
how
that
money
,
though
a
very
potent
spirit
,
never
to
be
disparage
on
any
account
whatever
,
could
not
keep
people
alive
whose
time
be
come
to
die
;
and
how
that
we
must
all
die
,
unfortunately
,
even
in
the
City
,
though
we
be
never
so
rich
.
<EOS>
but
how
that
money
cause
us
to
be
honour
,
fear
,
respect
,
courted
,
and
admire
,
and
make
us
powerful
and
glorious
in
the
eye
of
all
man
;
and
how
that
it
could
,
very
often
,
even
keep
off
death
,
for
a
long
time
together
.
<EOS>
how
,
for
example
,
it
have
secure
to
his
Mama
the
service
of
Mr
Pilkins
,
by
which
he
,
Paul
,
have
often
profit
himself
;
likewise
of
the
great
Doctor
Parker
Peps
,
whom
he
have
never
know
.
<EOS>
and
how
it
could
do
all
,
that
could
be
do
.
<EOS>
this
,
with
more
to
the
same
purpose
,
Mr
Dombey
instill
into
the
mind
of
his
son
,
who
listen
attentively
,
and
seem
to

Mr

be

astonished

so
uncomfortable

so
perfectly
at

how
to
pursue
the
conversation

that
he
could
only
sit
look
at
his

by
the
light
of

fire

once

the

it
seek
the

it

I

Paul

compose
himself
in

a
blessing
upon

Mrs

and
presently
Florence

in

the
child
immediately
start
up
with
sudden
readiness

animation
,
and
raise
towards
his
father
in
bid
him
good
night

a
countenance
so
much
bright

so
much
young

so
much
more
childlike

that
Mr

<EOS>
after

he

he
hear
a
soft
voice
singe
;

remember
that
Paul
have
say
his

to
him

he
have
the
curiosity
to
open

listen

look
after
them

She

they

toil
up
;
she
singe
all
the

Paul
sometimes
croon
out
a
feeble
accompaniment

<EOS>
Mr

look
after
them
until
they
reach
the
top
of
the
staircase

not
without
halt
to
rest
by
the
way

and
pass
out
of
his
sight
;

then
he
still
stand
gaze
upwards
,
until
the
dull
ray
of
the
moon

glimmer
in
a
melancholy
manner
through
the
dim

him
back

Mr

I

it

I
quite
agree
with
you

Paul

that
perhaps
topic
may

incautiously
mention
upstairs
before
him

which
it
would
be
as
well
for

little
mind
not

upon

I

if

I
must

I

with

that
a
short
absence

the
air

bodily

astonishing

I

observe
Miss

with
an
ingenuous
blush

have
be

pointedly

there

Mr

where
he

Their

have
great
weight

him

for
he
know
that
they
be
jealous
of

he
never

take
it
into

Paul

in
such

as
Mrs

You

<EOS>
this

ill

stooping
figure

with
a
mottled
face
,
like
bad

,
a
hook

,
and
a
hard
grey
eye

<EOS>
forty
year

but
his
relict
still
wear
black
bombazeen
,
of
such
a
lustreless
,
deep
,
dead
,
sombre
shade
,
that
gas
itself
could
not
light
her
up
after
dark
,
and
her
presence
be
a
quencher
to
any
number
of
candle
.
<EOS>
She
be
generally
speak
of
as
"
a
great
manager
"
of
child
;
and
the
secret
of
her
management
be
,
to
give
them
everything
that
they
do
not
like
,
and
nothing
that
they
do
---
which
be
find
to
sweeten
their
disposition
very
much
.
<EOS>
She
be
such
a
bitter
old
lady
,
that
one
be
tempt
to
believe
there
have
be
some
mistake
in
the
application
of
the
peruvian
machinery
,
and
that
all
her
water
of
gladness
and
milk
of
human
kindness
,
have
be
pump
out
dry
,
instead
of
the
mine
.
  
<EOS>
the
Castle
of
this
ogress

be
in
a
steep
by

street
at

where
the
soil
be
more
than
usually
chalky
,
flinty
,
and
sterile
,
and
the
house
be
more
than
usually
brittle
and
thin
;
where
the
small
frontgarden
have
the
unaccountable
property
of
produce
nothing
but
marigold
,
whatever

them
;
and
where

<EOS>
in
the
winter
time
the
air
could
not
be
get
out
of
the
Castle
,
and
in
the
summer
time
it
could
not
be
get
in
.
<EOS>
there
be
such
a
continual
reverberation
of
wind
in
it
,
that
it
sound
like
a
great
shell
,
which
the
inhabitant
be
oblige
to
hold
to
their
ear
night
and
day
,
whether
they
like
it
or
no

<EOS>
It
be
not

naturally

a

which
be
never

Mrs
Pipchin

a
collection
of
plant

which
impart
an
earthy
flavour
of
their
own

these

<EOS>
there

Mrs

she

<EOS>
at

after
prayer

<EOS>
as
little
Miss
Pankey

in
the
dark

Mrs
Pipchin
always
make
a
point

drive
her

like

hear
Miss

<EOS>
at
about
halfpast
nine
o'clock
the
odour

without
sweet

bread

"
a

the
Castle
shortly
after
.
  
<EOS>
the
breakfast
next
morning
be
like
the
tea
over

except
that
Mrs

her
roll
instead

more
irate
when

<EOS>
Master

<EOS>
Paul

---
who
be
constantly
in
tear
---
and
at
about
noon
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
preside
over
some
Early
Readings
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
part
of
Mrs
Pipchin
's
system
not
to
encourage
a
child
's
mind
to
develop
and
expand
itself
like
a
young
flower
,
but
to
open
it
by
force
like
an
oyster
,
the
moral
of
these
lesson
be
usually
of
a
violent
and
stunning
character
:
the
hero
---
a
naughty
boy
---
seldom
,
in
the
mild
catastrophe
,
be
finish
off
by
anything
less
than
a
lion

or
a
bear

<EOS>
such
be
life
at
Mrs
Pipchin
's
.
<EOS>
on
Saturday
Mr
Dombey
come
down
;
and
Florence
and
Paul
would
go
to
his
hotel
,
and
have
tea
.
<EOS>
They
pass
the
whole
of
Sunday
with
him
,
and
generally
ride
out
before
dinner
;
and
on
these
occasion
Mr
Dombey
seem
to
grow
,
like
Falstaff
's
assailant
,
and
instead
of
be
one
man
in
buckram
,
to
become
a
dozen
.
<EOS>
Sunday
evening
be
the
most
melancholy
evening
in
the
week
;
for
Mrs
Pipchin
always
make
a
point
of
be
particularly
cross
on
Sunday
night
.
<EOS>
Miss
Pankey
be
generally
bring
back
from
an
aunt
's
at
Rottingdean
,
in
deep
distress
;
and
Master
Bitherstone
,
whose
relative
be
all
in
India
,
and
who
be
require
to
sit
,
between
the
service
,
in
an
erect
position
with
his
head
against
the
parlour
wall
,
neither
move
hand
nor
foot
,
suffer
so
acutely
in
his
young
spirit
that
he
once
ask
Florence
,
on
a
Sunday
night
,
if
she
could
give
him
any
idea
of
the
way
back
to
Bengal
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
generally
say
that
Mrs
Pipchin
be
a
woman
of
system
with
child
;
and
no
doubt
she
be
.
<EOS>
certainly
the
wild
one
go
home
tame
enough
,
after
sojourn
for
a
few
month
beneath
her
hospitable
roof
.
<EOS>
It
be
generally
say
,
too
,
that
it
be
highly
creditable
of
Mrs
Pipchin
to
have
devote
herself
to
this
way
of
life
,
and
to
have
make
such
a
sacrifice
of
her
feeling
,
and
such
a
resolute
stand
against
her
trouble
,
when
Mr
Pipchin
break
his
heart
in
the
peruvian
mine
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
exemplary
old
lady
,
Paul
would
sit
stare
in
his
little
arm
-
chair
by
the
fire
,
for
any
length
of
time
.
<EOS>
He
never
seem
to
know
what
weariness
be
,
when
he
be
look
fixedly
at
Mrs
Pipchin
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
fond
of
her
;
he
be
not
afraid
of
her
;
but
in
those
old
,
old
mood
of
his
,
she
seem
to
have
a
grotesque
attraction
for
him
.
<EOS>
there
he
would
sit
,
look
at
her
,
and
warm
his
hand
,
and
look
at
her
,
until
he
sometimes
quite
confound
Mrs
Pipchin
,
Ogress
as
she
be
.
<EOS>
once
she
ask
him
,
when
they
be
alone
,
what
he
be

about
.
  
<EOS>
"
You

without

ask
Mrs

"
I

how
old
you
must
be

Paul

You

not

you

Infidel

"
say
Mrs
Pipchen
.
  
<EOS>
as
Paul
have
not
consider
the
subject
in
that
light
,
and
have
found
his
conclusion
on
the
allege
lunacy
of
the
bull
,
he
allow
himself
to
be
put
down
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
but
he
sit
turn
it
over
in
his
mind
,
with
such
an
obvious
intention
of
fix
Mrs
Pipchin
presently
,
that
even
that
hardy
old
lady
deem
it
prudent
to
retreat
until
he
should
have
forget
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
from
that
time
,
Mrs
Pipchin
appear
to
have
something
of
the
same
odd
kind
of
attraction
towards
Paul
,
as
Paul
have
towards
her
.
<EOS>
She
would
make
him
move
his
chair
to
her
side
of
the
fire
,
instead
of
sit
opposite
;
and
there
he
would
remain
in
a
nook
between
Mrs
Pipchin
and
the
fender
,
with
all
the
light
of
his
little
face
absorb
into
the
black
bombazeen
drapery
,
study
every
line
and
wrinkle
of
her
countenance
,
and
peer
at
the
hard
grey
eye
,
until
Mrs
Pipchin
be
sometimes
fain
to
shut
it
on
pretence
of
doze
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
have
an
old
black
cat
,
who
generally
lie
coil
upon
the
centre
foot
of
the
fender
,
purr
egotistically
,
and
wink
at
the
fire
until
the
contract
pupil
of
his
eye
be
like
two
note
of
admiration
.
<EOS>
the
good
old
lady
may
have
be
---
not
to
record
it
disrespectfully
---
a
witch
,
and
Paul
and
the
cat
her
two
familiar
,
as
they
all
sit
by
the
fire
together
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
quite
in
keeping
with
the
appearance
of
the
party
if
they
have
all
spring
up
the
chimney
in
a
high
wind
one
night
,
and
never

hear
of
any
more
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
however

never

<EOS>
the

Paul
,
and
Mrs

be
constantly
to

in
their
usual
place
after
dark

and
Paul
,
eschew
the
companionship
of
Master
Bitherstone
,
go
on
study
Mrs
Pipchin
,
and
the
cat
,
and
the
fire
,
night
after
night
,
as
if
they

necromancy

<EOS>
Mrs

put
her
own
construction
on
Paul
's
eccentricity
:
and
be
confirm
in
her
low
spirit
by
a
perplex
view
of
chimney
from
the
room
where
she
be
accustomed
to
sit
,
and
by
the
noise
of
the
wind
,
and
by
the
general
dulness
(
gashliness
be
Mrs

's
strong
expression
)
of
her
present
life
,
deduce
the
most
dismal
reflection
from
the

premise
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
part
of
Mrs

policy

that

Mrs

's
generic
name
for
female

from

Mrs

:
to
which
end
she
devote
much
of
her
time
to
conceal
herself
behind

spring
out
on
that
devoted
maiden
,
whenever
she
make
an

Miss

hard

may

produce
a
cessation

turn
in

and
,
presently
awake

sit
up
in

with
his
hair
hot

mournfully

she
indulge
in
melancholy

that
cheap
and
most
accessible
of
luxury

until

be
overpower
by
slumber

<EOS>
although
the
niece

Mrs
Pipchin
do
not
expect
to
find
that
exemplary
dragon
prostrate
on
the
hearth
-
rug
when
she
go
down
stair
,
she
be
relieve
to
find
her
unusually
fractious
and
severe
,
and
with
every
present
appearance
of
intending
to
live
a
long
time
to
be
a
comfort
to
all
who
know
her

<EOS>
nor
have
she
any
symptom

decline

in
the
course

the
ensue
week

when
the
constitutional
viand
still
continue
to
disappear
in
regular
succession
,
notwithstanding
that
Paul
study
her
as
attentively
as
ever
,
and
occupy
his
usual
seat
between
the
black
skirt
and
the
fender
,
with
unwavering
constancy

<EOS>
but
as
Paul
himself
be
no
strong
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
than
he
have
be
on
his
first
arrival
,
though
he
look
much
healthier
in
the
face
,
a
little
carriage
be
get
for
him
,
in
which
he
could
lie
at
his
ease
,
with
an
alphabet
and
other
elementary
work
of
reference
,
and
be
wheel
down
to
the
sea
-
side
.
<EOS>
consistent
in
his
odd
taste
,
the
child
set
aside
a
ruddy
-
faced
lad
who
be
propose
as
the
drawer
of
this
carriage
,
and
select
,
instead
,
his
grandfather
---
a
weazen
,
old
,
crab
-
faced
man
,
in
a
suit
of
batter
oilskin
,
who
have
get
tough
and
stringy
from
long
pickle
in
salt
water
,
and
who
smell
like
a
weedy
sea
-
beach
when
the
tide
be
out
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
notable
attendant
to
pull
him
along
,
and
Florence
always
walk
by
his
side
,
and
the
despondent
Wickam
bring
up
the
rear
,
he
go
down
to
the
margin
of
the
ocean
every
day
;
and
there
he
would
sit
or
lie
in
his
carriage
for
hour
together
:
never
so
distressed
as
by
the
company
of
child
---
Florence
alone
except
,
always
.
  
<EOS>
"
go
away
,
if
you
please

"
he
would
say
to
any
child
who
come
to
bear
him
company
.
"
<EOS>
thank
you
,
but
I
do
not
want
you

"
  
<EOS>
some
small
voice
,
near
his
ear

would
ask
him
how
he
be
,
perhaps
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
well

better
go

then
he
would
turn
his
head

watch
the

away

to
Florence
,
"
We
do
not

any
other

we

kiss
me

Floy

<EOS>
He
have
even
a
dislike
,
at
such
time
,
to
the
company
of
Wickam
,
and
be
well
pleased
when
she
stroll
away
,
as
she
generally
do

to
pick
up
shell
and
acquaintance

<EOS>
His
favourite
spot
be
quite
a
lonely
one

far
away
from
most
lounger

<EOS>
very
often
afterwards

Chapter

<EOS>
in
which
the
Wooden
Midshipman
get
into
Trouble
 
that
spice
of
romance
and
love
of
the
marvellous
,
of
which
there
be
a
pretty
strong
infusion
in
the
nature
of
young
Walter
Gay
,
and
which
the
guardianship
of
his
uncle
,
old
Solomon
Gills
,
have
not
very
much
weaken
by
the
water
of
stern
practical
experience
,
be
the
occasion
of
his
attach
an
uncommon
and
delightful
interest
to
the
adventure
of
Florence
with
good
Mrs
Brown
.
<EOS>
He
pamper
and
cherish
it
in
his
memory
,
especially
that
part
of
it
with
which
he
have
be
associate
:
until
it
become
the
spoiled
child
of
his
fancy
,
and
take
its
own
way
,
and
do
what
it
like
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
recollection
of
those
incident
,
and
his
own
share
in
them
,
may
have
be
make
the
more
captivating
,
perhaps
,
by
the
weekly
dreaming
of
old
Sol
and
Captain
Cuttle
on
Sundays
.
<EOS>
hardly
a
Sunday
pass
,
without
mysterious
reference
be
make
by
one
or
other
of
those
worthy
chum
to
Richard
Whittington
;
and
the
latter
gentleman
have
even
go
so
far
as
to
purchase
a
ballad
of
considerable
antiquity
,
that
have
long
flutter
among
many
other
,
chiefly
expressive
of
maritime
sentiment
,
on
a
dead
wall
in
the
Commercial
Roads
:
which
poetical
performance
set
forth
the
courtship
and
nuptial
of
a
promising
young
coal
-
whipper
with
a
certain
"
lovely
peg
,
"
the
accomplished
daughter
of
the
master
and
part
-
owner
of
a
Newcastle
collier
.
<EOS>
in
this
stirring
legend
,
Captain
Cuttle
descry
a
profound
metaphysical
bearing
on
the
case
of
Walter
and
Florence
;
and
it
excite
him
so
much
,
that
on
very
festive
occasion
,
as
birthday
and
few
other
non
-
dominical
holiday
,
he
would
roar
through
the
whole
song
in
the
little
back
parlour
;
make
an
amazing
shake
on
the
word
Pe
-
e
-
eg
,
with
which
every
verse
conclude
,
in
compliment
to
the
heroine
of
the
piece
.
  
<EOS>
but
a
frank
,
free
-
spirited
,
open
-
hearted
boy
,
be
not
much
give
to
analyse
the
nature
of
his
own
feeling
,
however
strong
their
hold
upon
him
:
and
<EOS>
Walter
would
have
find
it
difficult
to
decide
this
point
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
great
affection
for
the
wharf
where
he
have
encounter
Florence
,
and
for
the
street
(
albeit
not
enchant
in
themselves
)
by
which
they
have
come
home
.
<EOS>
the
shoe
that
have
so
often
tumble
off
by
way
,
he
preserve
in
his
own
room
;
and
,
sit
in
the
little
back
parlour
of
an
evening
,
he
have
draw
a
whole
gallery
of
fancy
portrait
of
good
Mrs
Brown
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
he
become
a
little
smart
in
his
dress
after
that
memorable
occasion
;
and
he
certainly
like
in
his
leisure
time
to
walk
towards
that
quarter
of
the
town
where
Mr
Dombey
's
house
be
situate
,
on
the
vague
chance
of
pass
little
Florence
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
but
the
sentiment
of
all
this
be
as
boyish
and
innocent
as
could
be
.
<EOS>
Florence
be
very
pretty
,
and
it
be
pleasant
to
admire
a
pretty
face
.
<EOS>
Florence
be
defenceless
and
weak
,
and
it
be
a
proud
thought
that
he
have
be
able
to
render
her
any
protection
and
assistantce
.
<EOS>
Florence
be
the
most
grateful
little
creature
in
the
world
,
and
it
be
delightful
to
see
her
bright
gratitude
beam
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
Florence
be
neglect
and
coldly
look
upon
,
and
his
breast
be
full
of
youthful
interest
for
the
slight
child
in
her
dull
,
stately
home
.
  
<EOS>
thus
it
come
about
that
,
perhaps
some
half
-
a
-
dozen
time
in
the
course
of
the
year
,
Walter
pull
off
his
hat
to
Florence
in
the
street
,
and
Florence
would
stop
to
shake
hand
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Wickam
(
who
,
with
a
characteristic
alteration
of
his
name
,
invariably
speak
of
him
as
"
Young
Graves
'
)
be
so
well
used
to
this
,
know
the
story
of
their
acquaintance
,
that
she
take
no
heed
of
it
at
all
.
<EOS>
Miss
Nipper
,
on
the
other
hand
,
rather
look
out
for
these
occasion
:
<EOS>
her
sensitive
young
heart
be
secretly
propitiate
by
Walter
's
good
look
,
and
incline
to
the
belief
that
its
sentiment
be
respond
to
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
way
,
Walter
,
so
far
from
forget
or
lose
sight
of
his
acquaintance
with
Florence
,
only
remember
it
better
and
better
.
<EOS>
as
to
its
adventurous
beginning
,
and
all
those
little
circumstance
which
give
it
a
distinctive
character
and
relish
,
he
take
them
into
account
,
more
as
a
pleasant
story
very
agreeable
to
his
imagination
,
and
not
to
be
dismiss
from
it
,
than
as
a
part
of
any
matter
of
fact
with
which
he
be
concerned
.
<EOS>
They
set
off
Florence
very
much
,
to
his
fancy
;
but
not
himself
.
<EOS>
sometimes
he
think
(
and
then
he
walk
very
fast
)
<EOS>
what
a
grand
thing
it
would
have
be
for
him
to
have
be
go
to
sea
on
the
day
after
that
first
meeting
,
and
to
have
go
,
and
to
have
do
wonder
there
,
and
to
have
stop
away
a
long
time
,
and
to
have
come
back
an
admiral
of
all
the
colour
of
the
dolphin
,
or
at
least
a
Post
-
Captain
with
epaulette
of
insupportable
brightness
,
and
have
marry
Florence
(
then
a
beautiful
young
woman
)
in
spite
of
Mr
Dombey
's
tooth
,
cravat
,
and
watch
-
chain
,
and
borne
her
away
to
the
blue
shore
of
somewhere
or
other
,
triumphantly
.
<EOS>
but
these
flight
of
fancy
seldom
burnish
the
brass
plate
of
Dombey
and
Son
's
office
into
a
tablet
of
golden
hope
,
or
shed
a
brilliant
lustre
on
their
dirty
skylight
;
and
when
the
Captain
and
Uncle
Sol
talk
about
Richard
Whittington
and
master
'
daughter
,
Walter
feel
that
he
understand
his
true
position
at
Dombey
and
Son
's
much
well
than
they
do
.
  
<EOS>
so
it
be
that
he
go
on
do
what
he
have
to
do
from
day
to
day
,
in
a
cheerful
,
pain
-
taking
,
merry
spirit
;
and
see
through
the
sanguine
complexion
of
Uncle
Sol
and
Captain
Cuttle
;
and
yet
entertain
a
thousand
indistinct
and
visionary
fancy
of
his
own
,
to
which
theirs
be
word
-
a
-
day
probability
.
<EOS>
such
be
his
condition
at
the
Pipchin
period
,
when
he
look
a
little
old
than
of
yore
,
but
not
much
;
and
be
the
same
light
-
footed
,
light
-
hearted
,
lightheaded
lad
,
as
when
he
charge
into
the
parlour
at
the
head
of
Uncle
Sol
and
the
imaginary
boarder
,
and
light
him
to
bring
up
the
Madeira
.

"

have
drop
the

too
if
he
could

and
sit

shelf
of

his
whole
stock
of
ready
money

amount
to
thirteen

a

,
which
he
transfer
to
one

some
thought

escape
by
that
unusual

rather

encounter
his
terrible
enemy

He
decide

however

in

of
stratagem

she

glide
in

<EOS>
some
five
minute
elapse
before
Captain
Cuttle
could
summon
courage
to
attempt
his
escape
;
for
Walter
wait
so
long
at
the
street
corner
,
look
back
at
the
house
,
before
there
be
any
symptom
of
the
hard
glaze
hat

<EOS>
at
length
the
Captain
burst
out
of
the
door
with
the
suddenness
of
an
explosion
,
and
come
towards
him
at
a
great
pace
,
and
never
once
look
over
his
shoulder

pretend

as
soon

well
out

<EOS>
the

thought
of
Solomon

mingle
perhaps
with
some
reflection
on
his
late
escape
from
Mrs

to
offer
any
further
quotation
on
the
way
for
Walter

moral
improvement

They
interchange
no

Captain

with
a
gravity
suitable

nature
of
the
occasion

to
Mr

which
be
awful
to

of

Walter
feel
that
he
would
rather
prefer
it
alone
and
unassisted

than
back
by
the
personal
influence
of
Captain
Cuttle
,
to
which
he
hardly
think
Mr
Dombey
would
attach
much
weight
.
<EOS>
but
as
the
Captain
appear
to
be
of
quite
another
opinion
,

be
bent
upon
it
,
and
as
his
friendship
be
too
zealous

serious
to
be
trifle
with
by
one
so
much
young
than
himself

he
forbear
to
hint
the
least
objection

<EOS>
Cuttle

therefore

bore
him

long
and
frequent
observation
of

across
Princess

through
his
double

barrelled

after
receive
many
minute
report

daily

on

subject
,
from
the
native
who
keep
himself
in
constant
communication
with
Miss
Tox
's
maid
for
that
purpose
;
come
to
the
conclusion
that
Dombey
,
Sir
,
be
a
man
to
be
know
,
and
that
JB
be
the
boy
to
make
his
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Tox
,
however
,
maintain
her
reserve
behaviour
,
and
frigidly
decline
to
understand
the
major
whenever
he
call
(
which
he
often
do
)
on
any
little
fishing
excursion
connect
with
this
project
,
the
Major
,
in
spite
of
his
constitutional
toughness
and
slyness
,
be
fain
to
leave
the
accomplishment
of
his
desire
in
some
measure
to
chance
,

which
,
"
as
he
be
use
to
observe
with
chuckle
at
his
club

have
be
fifty
to

in

of
Joey

<EOS>
It
be
some
time
come
to
his

it
befriend
him
at
last
.
<EOS>
when
the
dark
servant
,
with
full
particular
,
report
Miss
Tox
absent
on
Brighton
service
,
the
Major
be
suddenly
touch
with
affectionate
reminiscence
of
his
friend
Bill
Bitherstone
of
Bengal
,
who
have
write
to
ask
him
,
if
he
ever
go
that
way
,
to
bestow
a
call
upon
his
only
son
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
same
dark
servant
report
Paul
at
Mrs
Pipchin
's
,
and
the
Major
,
refer
to
the
letter
favour
by
Master
Bitherstone
on
his
arrival
in
England
---
to
which
he
have
never
have
the
least
idea
of
pay
any
attention
---
see
the
opening
that
present
itself
,
he
be
make
so
rabid
by
the
gout
,
with
which
he
happen
to
be
then
lay
up
,
that
he
throw
a
footstool
at
the
dark
servant
in
return
for
his
intelligence
,
and
swear
he
would
be
the
death
of
the
rascal
before
he
have
do
with
him
:
which
the
dark
servant
be
more
than
half
dispose
to
believe
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
the
Major
be
release
from
his
fit
,
go
one
Saturday
growl
down
to
Brighton
,
with
the
native
behind
him
;
apostrophize
Miss

all
the

gloat
over
the
prospect
of

by
storm

distinguished
friend
to
whom
she
attach
so
much
mystery

for

young

at

kind

half

trot

roll
his

stagger
away

afterwards
call
on

at
Mr

house
in
town

and
come
down
again
,
in
the

coach
as
Mr
Dombey

<EOS>
in
short
,
Mr
Dombey
and
the
Major
get
on
uncommonly
well
together

and
uncommonly
fast
:
and
Mr
Dombey
observe
of
the
Major
,
to
his
sister
,
that
besides
be
quite
a
military
man
he
be
really
something
more
,
as
he
have
a
very
admirable
idea
of
the
importance
of
thing
unconnecte
with
his
own
profession
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
Mr
Dombey
,
bring
down
Miss
Tox
and
Mrs
Chick
to
see
the
child
,
and
find
the
Major
again
at
Brighton
,
invite
him
to
dinner
at
the
Bedford
,
and
compliment
Miss
Tox
highly
,
beforehand
,
on
her
neighbour
and
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
palpitation
of
the
heart
which
these
allusion
occasion
her
,
they
be
anything
but
disagreeable
to
Miss
Tox
,
as
they
enable
her
to
be
extremely
interesting
,
and
to
manifest
an
occasional
incoherence
and
distraction
which
she
be
not
at
all
unwilling
to
display
.
<EOS>
the
Major
give
her
abundant
opportunity
of
exhibit
this
emotion
:
be
profuse
in
his
complaint
,
at
dinner
,
of
her
desertion
of
him
and
Princess
's
place
:
and
as
he
appear
to
derive
great
enjoyment
from
make
them
,
they
all
get
on
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
none
the
bad
on
account
of
the
Major
take
charge
of
the
whole
conversation
,
and
show
as
great
an
appetite
in
that
respect
as
in
regard
of
the
various
dainty
on
the
table
,
among
which
he
may
be
almost
say
to
have
wallow
:
greatly
to
the
aggravation
of
his
inflammatory
tendency
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
's
habitual
silence
and
reserve
yield
readily
to
this
usurpation
<EOS>
,
the
Major
feel
that
he
be
come
out
and
shine
:
<EOS>
and
in
the
flow
of
spirit
thus
engender
,
ring
such
an
infinite
number
of
new
change
on
his
own
name
that
he
quite
astonish
himself
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
they
be
all
very
well
pleased
.
<EOS>
the
Major
be
consider
to
possess
an
inexhaustible
fund
of
conversation
;
and
when
he
take
a
late
farewell
,
after
a
long
rubber
,
Mr
Dombey
again
compliment
the
blushing
Miss
Tox
on
her
neighbour
and
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
but
all
the
way
home
to
his
own
hotel
,
the
Major
incessantly
say
to
himself
,
and
of
himself
,
"
<EOS>
Sly
,
Sir
---
sly
,
Sir
---
de
-
vil

ish
sly

"
<EOS>
and
when
he
get
there
,
sit
down
in
a
chair
,
and
fall
into
a
silent
fit
of
laughter
,
with
which
he
be
sometimes
seize
,
and
which
be
always
particularly
awful
.
<EOS>
It
hold
him
so
long
on
this
occasion
that
the
dark
servant
,
who
stand
watch
him
at
a
distance
,
but
dare
not
for
his
life
approach
,
twice
or
thrice
give
him
over
for
lose
.
<EOS>
His
whole
form
,
but
especially
his
face
and
head
,
dilate
beyond
all
former
experience
;
and
present
to
the
dark
man
's
view
,
nothing
but
a
heavy
mass
of
indigo
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
burst
into
a
violent
paroxysm
of
coughing
,
and
when
that
be
a
little
better
burst
into
such
ejaculation
as
the
follow
:
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you

would
you
?
<EOS>
Mrs
Dombey
,

Mr

break
his

that
if

in

<EOS>
Captain

feel
he
have
no

to
comply

<EOS>
but
he
be
so
much
strike

the
magnanimity

Mr

in

that
when

pocket
,
and
the
ready
money
in
another
,
and
have
lower
the
great
watch
down
slowly
into
its
proper
vault
,
he
could
not
refrain
from
seize
that
gentleman

right
hand
in
his

solitary
left

and
while
he
hold

bring

hook
down

transport
of
admiration

at
this
touch

shiver
all
over

<EOS>
Captain

then
kiss
his
hook
to
the
lady
several
time
,
with
great
elegance
and
gallantry
;
and
have
take
a
particular
leave
of
Paul
and
Florence
,
accompany
Walter
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Florence
be
run
after
them
in
the
earnestness
of
her
heart
,
to
send
some
message
to
old
Sol
,
when
Mr
Dombey
,
call
her
back
,
and
bade
her
stay
where
she
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
never
be
a
Dombey

my

"
say
Mrs

,
with
pathetic
reproachfulness
.
  
<EOS>
"
dear
Aunt

"
say
Florence

<EOS>
"
do
not

angry
with
me

<EOS>
I
be
so
thankful
to
Papa

"
  
<EOS>
She
would
have
run
and
throw
her
arm
about
his
neck
if
she
have
dare
;
but
as
she
do
not
dare
,
she
glance
with
thankful
eye
towards
him
,
as
he
sit
muse
;
sometimes
bestow
an
uneasy
glance
on
her
,
but
,
for
the
most
part
,
watch
Paul
,
who
walk
about
the
room
with
the
new

blow
dignity
of
have
let
young
Gay
have
the
money

<EOS>
and
young
Gay
---
Walter

<EOS>
what
of
him
?
  
<EOS>
He
be
overjoy
to
purge
the
old
man
's
hearth
from
bailiff
and
broker
,
and
to
hurry
back
to
his
uncle
with
the
good
tiding
.
<EOS>
He
be
overjoyed
to
have
it
all
arrange
and
settle
next
day
before
noon
;
and
to
sit
down
at
evening
in
the
little
back
parlour
with
old
Sol
and
Captain
Cuttle
;
and
to
see
the
instrument
-
maker
already
revive
,
and
hopeful
for
the
future
,
and
feel
that
the
wooden
midshipman
be
his
own
again
.
<EOS>
but
without
the
least
impeachment
of
his
gratitude
to
Mr
Dombey
,
it
must
be
confess
that
Walter
be
humble
and
cast
down
.
<EOS>
It
be
when
our
bud
hope
be
nip
beyond
recovery
by
some
rough
wind
,
that
we
be
the
most
disposed
to
picture
to
ourselves
<EOS>
what
flower
they
may
have
bear
,
if
they
have
flourish
;
and
now
,
when
Walter
find
himself
cut
off
from
that
great
Dombey
height
,
by
the
depth
of
a
new
and
terrible
tumble
,
and
feel
that
all
his
old
wild
fancy
have
be
scatter
to
the
wind
in
the
fall
,
he
begin
to
suspect
that
they
may
have
lead
him
on
to
harmless
vision
of
aspire
to
Florence
in
the
remote
distance
of
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
view
the
subject
in
quite
a
different
light
.
<EOS>
He
appear
to
entertain
a
belief
that
the
interview
at
which
he
have
assist
be
so
very
satisfactory
and
encouraging
,
as
to
be
only
a
step
or
two
remove
from
a
regular
betrothal
of
Florence
to
Walter
;
and
that
the
late
transaction
have
immensely
forward
,
if
not
thoroughly
establish
,
the
whittingtonian
hope
.
<EOS>
stimulate
by
this
conviction
,
and
by
the
improvement
in
the
spirit
of
his
old
friend
,
and
by
his
own
consequent
gaiety
,
he
even
attempt
,
in
favour
them
with
the
ballad
of
"
Lovely
Peg
"
for
the
third
time
in
one
evening
,
to
make
an
extemporaneous
substitution
of
the
name
"
Florence
;
"
but
find
this
difficult
,
on
account
of
the
word
Peg
invariably
rhyme
to
leg
(
in
which
personal
beauty
the
original

,
he
hit
upon
the
happy
thought
of

it
to

which
he
accordingly
do
,
with
an
archness
almost
supernatural

quite
vociferous
,
notwithstanding
that
the
time
be
close

New
Scene
 
<EOS>
MRS
PIPCHIN
's
constitution
be
make
of
such
hard
metal
,
in
spite
of
its
liability
to
the
fleshly
weakness
of
stand
in
need
of
repose
after
chop
,
and
of
require
to
be
coax
to
sleep
by
the
soporific
agency
of
sweet

bread
,
that
it
utterly
set
at
naught
the
prediction
of
Mrs
Wickam
,
and
show
no
symptom
of
decline
.
<EOS>
yet
,
as
Paul
's
rapt
interest
inthe
old
lady
continue
unabated
,
Mrs
Wickam
would
not
budge
an
inch
from
the
position
she
have
take
up
.
<EOS>
fortifying
and
entrench
herself
on
the
strong
ground
of
her
uncle
's
Betsey
Jane
,
she
advise
Miss
Berry
,
as
a
friend
,
to
prepare
herself
for
the
bad
;
and
forewarn
her
that
her
aunt
may
,
at
any
time
,
be
expect
to
go
off
suddenly
,
like
a
powder
-
mill
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Berry
take
it
all
in
good
part
,
and
drudge
and
slave
away
as
usual
;
perfectly
convince
that
Mrs
Pipchin
be
one
of
the
most
meritorious
person
in
the
world
,
and
make
every
day
innumerable
sacrifice
of
herself
upon
the
altar
of
that
noble
old
woman
.
<EOS>
but
all
these
immolation
of
Berry
be
somehow
carry
to
the
credit
of
Mrs
Pipchin
by
Mrs
Pipchin
's
friend
and
admirer
;
and
be
make
to
harmonise
with
,
and
carry
out
,
that
melancholy
fact
of
the
deceased
Mr
Pipchin
have
break
his
heart
in
the
peruvian
mine
.
  
<EOS>
for
example
,
there
be
an
honest
grocer
and
general
dealer
in
the
retail
line
of
business
,
between
whom
and
Mrs
Pipchin
there
be
a
small
memorandum
book
,
with
a
greasy
red
cover
,
perpetually
in
question
,
and
concern
which
diver
secret
council
and
conference
be
continually
be
hold
between
the
party
to
the
register
,
on
the
mat
in
the
passage
,
and
with
close
door
in
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
nor
be
there
want
dark
hint
from
Master
Bitherstone
(
whose

make
re

vengeful
by
the
solar
heat
of
India
act
on
his
blood
)
,
of
balance
unsettle
,
and
of
a
failure
,
on
one
occasion
with
his
memory
,
in
the
supply
of
moist
sugar
at
tea
-
time
.
<EOS>
this
grocer
be
a
bachelor
,
and
not
a
man
who
look
upon
the
surface
for
beauty
,
have
once
make
honourable
offer
for
the
hand
of
Berry
,
which
Mrs
Pipchin
have
,
with
contumely
and
scorn
,
reject
.
<EOS>
everybody
say
how
laudable
this
be
in
Mrs
Pipchin
,
relict
of
a
man
who
have
die
of
the
peruvian
mine
;
and
what
a
staunch
,
high
,
independent
spirit
the
old
lady
have
.
<EOS>
but
nobody
say
anything
about
poor
Berry
,
who
cry
for
six
week
(
be
soundly
rate
by
her
good
aunt
all
the
time
)
,
and
lapse
into
a
state
of
hopeless
spinsterhood

<EOS>
"
Berry
be
very
fond
of
you
<EOS>
,
be
not
she
?
"
<EOS>
Paul
once
ask
Mrs

when

<EOS>
"
yes

Mrs

.
  
<EOS>
"
why

"
ask
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"

return
the
disconcerted
old
lady

<EOS>
"
how

such
thing
,
Sir

<EOS>
why
be
you
fond
of
your

because

shortly

ask
Paul

lean
forward
in
his

and
look
at

very
hard
.
  
<EOS>
"
no

the
old

.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be

<EOS>
Mrs

do
not
dare
to
ask
him
why
,
lest
she
should
receive
some
perfectly
annihilate
answer
.
<EOS>
but
as
a
compensation
to
her
wounded
feeling
,
she
harass
Master
Bitherstone
to
that
extent
until
bed

time
,
that
he
begin
that
very
night
to
make
arrangement
for
an
overland
return
to
India
,

quarter

a
round

a
fragment

Mrs

They

the

dreamy
child

<EOS>
one
Saturday
afternoon

the
unlooked

and
some
knock
about

Mrs

"
but
such
health

I
be
grateful

"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
incline
his
head
with
the
satisfied

of
a
patron

who
feel
that
this
be
the
sort
of
thing
for

<EOS>
after
a
moment

"
<EOS>
Mrs

I
have

I
have
have

so
for
some

defer

would
have
apply
very
much
the

to
any

on

part
of

too
;
but
as
the
hard
grey
eye
be
sharp
enough
to
see
that
the
recipe
,
however
Mr

may
admit
its
efficacy
in
the
case
of
the
daughter
,
be
not
a
sovereign
remedy
for
the
son

she
argue
the
point
;
and
contend
that
change
,
and
new
society
,
and
the
different
form
of
life
he
would
lead
at
Doctor
Blimber
's
,
and
the
study
he

would

soon
prove
sufficient

<EOS>
as
this
chime
in

it
give
that
gentleman
a
still
high
opinion
of
Mrs

understanding
:
and
as
Mrs
Pipchin
,
at
the
same
time
,
bewail
the
loss
of
her
dear
little
friend
(
which
be
not
an
overwhelming
shock
to
her
,
as
she
have
long
expect
it
,
and
have
not
look
,
in
the
beginning
,
for
his
remain
with
her
long
than
three
month
)
,
he
form
an
equally
good
opinion
of
Mrs
Pipchin
's
disinterestedness
.
<EOS>
It
be
plain
that
he
have
give
the
subject
anxious
consideration
,
for
he
have
form
a
plan
,
which
he
announce
to
the
ogress
,
of
send
Paul
to
the
Doctor
be
as
a
weekly
boarder
for
the
first
half
year
,
during
which
time
Florence
would
remain
at
the
castle
,
that
she
may
receive
her
brother
there
,
on
Saturdays
.
<EOS>
this
would
wean
him
by
degree
,
Mr
Dombey
say
;
probably
with
a
recollection
of
his
not
have
be
wean
by
degree
on
a
former
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
finish
the
interview
by
express
his
hope
that
Mrs
Pipchin
would
still
remain
in
office
as
general
superintendent
and
overseer
of
his
son
,
pende
his
study
at
Brighton
;
and
have
kiss
Paul
,
and
shake
hand
with
Florence
,
and
beheld
Master
Bitherstone
in
his
collar
of
state
,
and
make
Miss
Pankey
cry
by
pat
her
on
the
head
(
in
which
region
she
be
uncommonly
tender
,
on
account
of
a
habit
Mrs
Pipchin
have
of
sound
it
with
her
knuckle
,
like
a
cask
)
,
he
withdraw
to
his
hotel
and
dinner
:
resolve
that
Paul
,
now
that
he
be
get
so
old
and
well
,
should
begin
a
vigorous
course
of
education
forthwith
,
to
qualify
him
for
the
position
in
which
he
be
to
shine
;
and
that
Doctor
Blimber
should
take
him
in
hand
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
whenever
a
young
gentleman
be
take
in
hand
by
Doctor
Blimber
,
he
may
consider
himself
sure
of
a
pretty
tight
squeeze
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
only
undertake
the
charge
of
ten
young
gentleman
,
but
he
have
,
always
ready
,
a
supply
of
learn
for
a
hundred
,
on
the
low
estimate
;
and
it
be
at
once
the
business
and
delight
of
his
life
to
gorge
the
unhappy
ten
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
fact
,
Doctor
Blimber
's
establishment
be
a
great
hot
-
house
,
in
which
there
be
a
force
apparatus
incessantly
at
work

<EOS>
all

<EOS>
mental
green

<EOS>
mathematical
gooseberry
(
very
sour
one
too
)
be
common
at
untimely
season
,
and
from
mere
sprout
of
bush
,
under
Doctor
Blimber
's
cultivation
.
<EOS>
every
description
of
greek

Latin
vegetable

off
the
dry
twig
of
boy

under
the
frostiest
circumstance

<EOS>
nature
be
of
no
consequence
at
all

<EOS>
no

what
a
young
gentleman
be
intend
to
bear
,
Doctor
Blimber
make
him
bear
to
pattern
,
somehow
or
other
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
all
very
pleasant
and
ingenious
,
but
the
system
of
force
be
attend
with
its
usual
disadvantage
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
the
right
taste
about
the
premature
production
,
and
they
do
not
keep
well
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
one
young
gentleman
,
with
a
swollen
nose
and
an
excessively
large
head
(
the
old
of
the
ten
who
have
"
go
through
"
everything
)
,
suddenly
leave
off
blow
one
day
,
and
remain
in
the
establishment
a
mere
stalk
.
<EOS>
and
people
do
say
that
the
Doctor
have
rather
overdo
it
with
young
toot
,
and
that
when
he
begin
to
have
whisker
he
leave
off

<EOS>
there
young
toot
be

at
any
rate

possess
of
the
gruff

voice
and
the
shrillest

mind
;
stick
ornamental
pin
into
his
shirt
,
and
keep
a
ring
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
to
put
on
his
little
finger
by
stealth
,
when
the
pupil
go
out
walk
;
constantly
fall
in
love
by
sight
with
nurserymaid
,
who
have
no
idea
of
his
existence
;
and
look
at
the
gas

light
world
over
the
little
iron
bar
in
the
left

hand
corner
window
of
the
front
three
pair

stair
,
after

like
a
greatly
overgrow

much
too
long

<EOS>
the
Doctor
be
a
portly
gentleman
in
a
suit
of
black
,
with
string
at
his
knee
,
and
stocking
below
them
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
bald
head
,
highly
polished
;
a
deep
voice
;
and
a
chin
so
very
double
,
that
it
be
a
wonder
how
he
ever
manage
to
shave
into
the
crease
.
<EOS>
He
have
likewise
a
pair
of
little
eye
that
be
always
half
shut
up
,
and
a
mouth
that
be
always
half
expand
into
a
grin
,
as
if
he
have
,
that
moment
,
pose
a
boy
,
and
be
wait
to
convict
him
from
his
own
lip
.
<EOS>
insomuch
,
that
when
the
Doctor
put
his
right
hand
into
the
breast
of
his
coat
,
and
with
his
other
hand
behind
him
,
and
a
scarcely
perceptible
wag
of
his
head
,
make
the
common
observation
to
a
nervous
stranger
,
it
be
like
a
sentiment
from
the
sphynx

settle
his
business

<EOS>
the
Doctor

be
a
mighty
fine
house
,
front
the
sea

<EOS>
not
a
joyful
style

quite

contrary

themselves
despondently
behind

<EOS>
the
table

put
away
in

<EOS>
fire
be
so
rarely
light
in
the
room
of
ceremony
,
that
they
feel
like
wells

and
a
visitor
represent
the
bucket
;
the
dining

room
seem
the
last
place
in
the
world
where
any
eat
or
drinking
be
likely
to
occur
;
there
be
no
sound
through
all
the
house
but
the
ticking
of
a
great
clock
in
the
hall
,
which
make
itself
audible
in
the
very
garret
:
and
sometimes
a
dull
crying
of
young
gentleman
at
their
lesson
,
like
the
murmuring
of
an
assemblage
of
melancholy
pigeon

She

They
must
be
dead

stone
dead

then

them
up

party

Cicero

she

<EOS>
It

the
steady
joy

her
life
to
see
the
Doctor

young

go
out
walk
,
unlike
all
other
young
gentleman
,
in
the
large
possible
shirt

cravat

<EOS>
It

so
classical

<EOS>
as
to
Mr
Feeder

BA
,
Doctor
Blimber
's
assistant
,
he
be
a
kind
of
human
barrel
-
organ
,
with
a
little
list
of
tune
at
which
he
be
continually
work
,
over
and
over
again
,
without
any
variation
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
be
fit
up
with
a
change
of
barrel
,
perhaps
,
in
early
life
,
if
his
destiny
have
be
favourable
;
but
it
have
not
be
;
and
he
have
only
one
,
with
which
,
in
a
monotonous
round
,
it
be
his
occupation
to
bewilder
the
young
idea
of
Doctor
Blimber

young
gentleman
.
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman

prematurely
full
of
cark

They

the
pursuit

stony

savage

inflexible
syntactic

ghost
of
exercise
that
appear

<EOS>
under
the
force
system

a
young
gentleman
usually
take
leave
of
his
spirit
in
three
week

<EOS>
He
have
all
the
care
of
the
world
on
his
head
in
three
month

<EOS>
He
conceive
bitter
sentiment
against
his
parent
or
guardian
in
four
;
he
be
an
old
misanthrope
,
in
five
;
envy
Curtius
that
bless
refuge
in
the
earth
,
in
six
;
and
at
the
end
of
the
first
twelvemonth
have
arrive
at
the
conclusion

from
which
he
never
afterwards
depart
,
that
all
the
fancy
of
the
poet

a

give
utterance

Cicero
could
have
prove
a

consolation

that
he
should

and
a
blackbird
he

<EOS>
Tozer

<EOS>
Briggs
be
in

too
,
before
the
weak
-
eyed
young
man
appear
to
take
away
the
candle
,
when
he
wish
them
good
night
and
pleasant
dream
.
<EOS>
but
his
benevolent
wish
be
in
vain
,
as
far
as
Briggs
and
Tozer
be
concern
;
for
Paul
,
who
lie
awake
for
a
long
while
,
and
often
wake
afterwards
,
find
that
Briggs
be
ride
by
his
lesson
as
a
nightmare
:
and
that
Tozer
,
whose
mind
be
affect
in
his
sleep
by
similar
cause
,
in
a
minor
degree
,
talk
unknown
tongue
,
or
scrap
of
Greek
and
Latin
<EOS>
---
it
be
all
one
to
Paul
---
which
,
in
the
silence
of
night
,
have
an
inexpressibly
wicked
and
guilty
effect
.
  
<EOS>
Paul
have
sink
into
a
sweet
sleep
,
and
dream
that
he
be
walk
hand
in
hand
with
Florence
through
beautiful
garden
,
when
they
come
to
a
large
sunflower
which
suddenly
expand
itself
into
a
gong
,
and
begin
to
sound
.
<EOS>
open
his
eye
,
he
find
that
it
be
a
dark
,
windy
morning
,
with
a
drizzling
rain
:
and
that
the
real
gong
be
give
dreadful
note
of
preparation
,
down
in
the
hall
.
  
<EOS>
so
he
get
up
directly
,
and
find
Briggs
with
hardly
any
eye
,
for
nightmare
and
grief
have
make
his
face
puffy
,
put
his
boot
,
on
:
while
Tozer
stand
shiver
and
rub
his
shoulder
in
a
very
bad
humour
.
<EOS>
poor
Paul
could
not
dress
himself
easily
,
not
be
use
to
it
,
and
ask
them
if
they
would
have
the
goodness
to
tie
some
string
for
him
;
but
as
Briggs
merely
say
"
bother
!
"
<EOS>
and
Tozer
,
"
<EOS>
oh
yes
!
"
he
go
down
when
he
be
otherwise
ready
,
to
the
next
story
,
where
he
see
a
pretty
young
woman
in
leather
glove
,
clean
a
stove
.
<EOS>
the
young
woman
seem
surprised
at
his
appearance
,
and
ask
him
where
his
mother
be
.
<EOS>
when
Paul
tell
her
she
be
dead
,
she
take
her
glove
off
,
and
do
what
he
want
;
and
furthermore
rub
his
hand
to
warm
them
;
and
give
him
a
kiss
;
and
tell
him
whenever
he
want
anything
of
that
sort
---
mean
in
the
dress
way
---
to
ask
for
"
Melia
;
which
Paul
,
thank
her
very
much
,
say
he
certainly
would
.
<EOS>
He
then
proceed
softly
on
his
journey
down
stair
,
towards
the
room
in
which
the
young
gentleman
resume
their
study
,
when
,
pass
by
a
door
that
stand
ajar
,
a
voice
from
within
cry
,
"
be
that
dombey
?
"
<EOS>
on
Paul
reply
,
"
yes
,
madam
:
"
<EOS>
for
he
know
the
voice
to
be
Miss
Blimber
's
:
Miss
Blimber
say
,
"
come
in
,
Dombey
.
"
<EOS>
and
in
he
go
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Blimber
present
exactly
the
appearance
she
have
present
yesterday
,
except
that
she
wear
a
shawl
.
<EOS>
Her
little
light
curl
be
as
crisp
as
ever
,
and
she
have
already
her
spectacle
on
,
which
make
Paul
wonder
whether
she
go
to
bed
in
them
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
cool
little
sitting
-
room
of
her
own
up
there
,
with
some
book
in
it
,
and
no
fire
.
<EOS>
but
Miss
Blimber
be
never
cold
,
and
never
sleepy
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
Dombey
,
"
say
Miss
Blimber
,
"
I
be
go
out
for
a
constitutional

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Paul
wonder
what
that
be
,
and
why
she
do
not
send
the
footman
out
to
get
it
in
such
unfavourable
weather
.
<EOS>
but
he
make
no
observation
on
the
subject
:
his
attention
be
devote
to
a
little
pile
of
new
book
on
which
Miss
Blimber
appear
to
have
be
recently
engage

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"

return
Miss
Blimber
;
"
and
Mr
Feeder
will

more
very
soon
,
if

studious
as
I
expect
you

Dombey

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank

Paul

<EOS>
"
I

"
resume
Miss
Blimber
;
"
and
while
I
be
go
,
that
be
to
say
in
the
interval
between
this
and
breakfast
,
Dombey
,
I
wish
you
to
read
over
what
I
have
mark
in
these
book
,
and
to
tell
me
if
you
quite
understand
what
you
have
get
to
learn
.
<EOS>
do
not
lose
time
,
Dombey
,
for
you
have
none
to
spare
,
but
take
them
down
stair
and
begin
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
madam
,
"
answer
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
so
many
of
them
,
that
although
Paul
put
one
hand
under
the
bottom
book
and
his
other
hand
and
his
chin
on
the
top
book
,
and
hug
them
all
closely
,
the
middle
book
slip
out
before
he
reach
the
door
,
and
then
they
all
tumble
down
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Miss
Blimber
say
,
"
oh
,
Dombey
,
Dombey
,
this
be
really
very
careless
!
"
and
pile
them
up
afresh
for
him
;
and
this
time
,
by
dint
of
balance
them
with
great
nicety
,
Paul
get
out
of
the
room
,
and
down
a
few
stair
before
two
of
them
escape
again
.
<EOS>
but
he
hold
the
rest
so
tight
,
that
he
only
leave
one
more
on
the
first
floor
,
and
one
in
the
passage
;
and
when
he
have
get
the
main
body
down
into
the
school
-
room
,
he
set
off
up
stair
again
to
collect
the
straggler
.
<EOS>
have
at
last
amass
the
whole
library
,
and
climb
into
his
place
,
he
fall
to
work
,
encourage
by
a
remark
from
Tozer
to
the
effect
that
he
"
be
in
for
it
now
;
"
which
be
the
only
interruption
he
receive
till
breakfast
time
.
<EOS>
at
that
meal
,
for
which
he
have
no
appetite
,
everything
be
quite
as
solemn
and
genteel
as
at
the
other
;
and
when
it
be
finish
,
he
follow
Miss
Blimber
up
stair
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
Dombey
,
"
say
Miss
Blimber
.
<EOS>
"
how
have
you
get
on
with
those
book
?
"
  
<EOS>
They
comprise
a
little
English
,
and
a
deal
of
Latin
---
name
of
thing
,
declension
of
article
and
substantive
,
exercise
thereon
,
and
preliminary
rule
---
a
trifle
of
orthography
,
a
glance
at
ancient
history
,
a
wink
or
two
at
modern
ditto
,
a
few
table
,
two
or
three
weight
and
measure
,
and
a
little
general
information
.
<EOS>
when
poor
Paul
have
spell
out
number
two
,
he
find
he
have
no
idea
of
number
one
;
fragment
whereof
afterwards
obtrude
themselves
into
number
three
,
which
slide
into
number
four
,
which
graft
itself
on
to
number
two
.
<EOS>
so
that
whether
twenty
Romuluses
make
a
Remus
,
or
hic
haec
hoc
be
troy
weight
,
or
a
verb
always
agree
with
an
ancient
Briton
,
or
three
time
four
be
Taurus
a
bull
,
be
open
question
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Dombey
,
Dombey
!
"
say
Miss
Blimber
,
"
this
be
very
shocking
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
if
you
please
,
"
say
Paul
,
"
I
think
if
I
may
sometimes
talk
a
little
to
old
Glubb
,
I
should
be
able
to
do
better

<EOS>
"

nonsense

Dombey

Miss

"
I
could
not
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
the
place
for
glubb
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
You
must
take
the
book
down
,
I
suppose
,
Dombey
,
one
by
one
,
and
perfect
yourself
in
the
day
's
instalment
of
subject
a
,
before
you
turn
at
all
to
subject
B.
<EOS>
and
now
take
away
the
top
book
,
if
you
please
,
Dombey
,
and
return
when
you
be
master
of
the
theme
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Blimber
express
her
opinion
on
the
subject
of
Paul
's
uninstructed
state
with
a
gloomy
delight
,
as
if
she
have
expect
this
result
,
and
be
glad
to
find
that
they
must
be
in
constant
communication
.
<EOS>
Paul
withdraw
with
the
top
task
,
as
he
be
tell
,
and
labour
away
at
it
,
down
below
;
sometimes
remember
every
word
of
it
,
and
sometimes
forget
it
all
,
and
everything
else
beside
:
until
at
last
he
venture
up
stair
again
to
repeat
the
lesson
,
when
it
be
nearly
all
drive
out
of
his
head
before
he
begin
,
by
Miss
Blimber
's
shut
up
the
book
,
and
say
,
"
go
on
,
Dombey
!
"
<EOS>
a
proceeding
so
suggestive
of
the
knowledge
inside
of
her
,
that
Paul
look
upon
the
young
lady
with
consternation
,
as
a
kind
of
learn
Guy
Faux
,
or
artificial
Bogle
,
stuff
full
of
scholastic
straw
.
  
<EOS>
He
acquit
himself
very
well
,
nevertheless
;
and
Miss
Blimber
,
commend
him
as
give
promise
of
get
on
fast
,
immediately
provide
him
with
subject
B
;
from
which
he
pass
to
c
,
and
even
D
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
It
be
hard
work
,
resume
his
study
,
soon
after
dinner
;
and
he
feel
giddy
and
confused
and
drowsy
and
dull
.
<EOS>
but
all
the
other
young
gentleman
have
similar
sensation
,
and
be
oblige
to
resume
their
study
too
,
if
there
be
any
comfort
in
that
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
wonder
that
the
great
clock
in
the
hall
,
instead
of
be
constant
to
its
first
inquiry
,
never
say
,
"
gentleman
,
we
will
now
resume
our
study
,
"
for
that
phrase
be
often
enough
repeat
in
its
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
the
study
go
round
like
a
mighty
wheel
,
and
the
young
gentleman
be
always
stretch
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
after
tea
there
be
exercise
again
,
and
preparation
for
next
day
by
candlelight
.
<EOS>
and
in
due
course
there
be
bed
;
where
,
but
for
that
resumption
of
the
study
which
take
place
in
dream

be
rest
and
sweet
forgetfulness

<EOS>
oh
Saturdays

<EOS>
oh
happy
Saturdays
,
when
Florence

in

stay
away
,
though
Mrs

worry
her
bitterly

<EOS>
those
Saturdays

be
sabbath
for
at

Sunday
night

the
heavy
Sunday
night
,
whose
shadow
darken
the
first
waking
burst
of
light

morning

could
mar
those
precious
Saturdays

<EOS>
whether
it
be
the
great
sea

shore
,
where
they
sit

stroll
together
;

whether
it
be
only
Mrs
Pipchin
's
dull
back
room
,
in
which
she
sing
to
him
so
softly
,
with
his
drowsy
head
upon
her
arm
;
Paul
never
care

<EOS>
It
be
Florence

<EOS>
that
be
all
he

so

him
up
for
another

She

no

She

it
must
be
war

and
war

be
;
and
Mrs

live
from
that
time
in
the

of
surprise

harassing

and
defiance

skirmishing
attack

Miss

have
return
one
Sunday
night
with
Florence
,
from
walk
back
with
Paul
to
the
Doctor

when
Florence

her
bosom
a
little
piece
of
paper

on
which
she
have
pencil
down
some
word
.
  
<EOS>
"

"
these
be
the
name
of
the
little
book
that
Paul
bring
home
to
do
those
long
exercise
with

be
so
tired

I
copy

last
night

Nipper

<EOS>
I
would
as
soon
see
Mrs

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
to
buy
them
for
me
,
Susan

if
you
will

tomorrow
morning

<EOS>
I
have
money

Florence

<EOS>
"
why
,
goodness
gracious
me
,
Miss
Floy
,
"
return
Miss
Nipper
,
"
how
can
you
talk
like
that
,
when
you
have
book
upon
book
already
,
and
masters
and
missesse
a
teaching
of
you
everything
continual
,
though
my
belief
be
that
your
Pa
,
Miss
Dombey
,
never
would
have
learn
you
nothing
,
never
would
have
think
of
it
,
unless
you
would
ask
him
---
when
he
could
not
well
refuse
;
but
give
consent
when
ask
,
and
offer
when
unasked
,
Miss
,
be
quite
two
thing
;
I
may
not
have
my
objection
to
a
young
man
's
keep
company
with
me
,
and
when
he
put
the
question
,
may
say
"
yes
,
"
but
that
be
not
say
"
would
you
be
so
kind
as
like
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
you
can
buy
me
the
book
,
Susan
;
and
you
will
,
when
you
know
I
want
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Miss
,
and
why
do
you
want'em
?
"
reply
Nipper
;
add
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
if
it
be
to
fling
at
Mrs
Pipchin
's
head
,
I
would
buy
a
cart

load

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
could
perhaps
give
Paul
some
help
,
Susan
,
if
I
have
these
book

say
Florence
,
"
and
make
the
come
week
a
little
easy
to
him
.
<EOS>
at
least
I
want
to
try
.
<EOS>
so
buy
them
for
me
,
dear

and
<EOS>
I
will
never
forget
how
kind
it
be
of
you
to
do
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
must
have
be
a
hard
heart
than
Susan
Nipper
's
that
could
have
reject
the
little
purse
Florence
hold
out
with
these
word
,
or
the
gentle
look
of
entreaty
with
which
she
second
her
petition
.
<EOS>
Susan
put
the
purse
in
her
pocket
without
reply
,
and
trot
out
at
once
upon
her
errand
.
  
<EOS>
the
book
be
not
easy
to
procure
:
and
the
answer
at
several
shop
be
,
either
that
they
be
just
out
of
them
,
or
that
they
never
keep
them
,
or
that
they
have
have
a
great
many
last
month
,
or
that
they
expect
a
great
many
next
week
.
<EOS>
but
Susan
be
not
easily
baffle
inn
such
an
enterprise
;
and
have
entrap
a
white
-
haired
youth
,
in
a
black
calico
apron
,
from
a
library
where
she
be
know
,
to
accompany
her
in
her
quest
,
she
lead
him
such
a
life
in
go
up
and
down
,
that
he
exert
himself
to
the
utmost
,
if
it
be
only
to
get
rid
of
her
;
and
finally
enable
her
to
return
home
in
triumph
.
  
<EOS>
with
these
treasure
then
,
after
her
own
daily
lesson
be
over
,
florence
sit
down
at
night
to
track
Paul
's
footstep
through
the
thorny
way
of
learn
;
and
be
possess
of
a
naturally
quick
and
sound
capacity
,
and
teach
by
that
most
wonderful
of
master
,
love
,
it
be
not
long
before
she
gain
upon
Paul
's
heel
,
and
catch
and
pass
him
.
  
<EOS>
not
a
word
of
this
be
breathe
to
Mrs
Pipchin
:
but
many
a
night
when
they
be
all
in
bed
,
and
when
Miss
Nipper
,
with
her
hair
in
paper
and
herself
asleep
in
some
uncomfortable
attitude
,
repose
unconscious
by
her
side
;
and
when
the
chinking
ash
in
the
grate
be
cold
and
grey
;
and
when
the
candle
be
burn
down
and
gutter
out
;
---
Florence
try
so
hard
to
be
a
substitute
for
one
small
Dombey
,
that
her
fortitude
and
perseverance
may
have
almost
win
her
a
free
right
to
bear
the
name
herself
.
  
<EOS>
and
high
be
her
reward
,
<EOS>
when
one
Saturday
evening
,
as
little
Paul
be
sit
down
as
usual
to
"
resume
his
study
,
"
she
sit
down
by
his
side
,
and
show
him
all
that
be
so
rough
,
make
smooth
,
and
all
that
be
so
dark
,
make
clear
and
plain
,
before
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
nothing
but
a
startled
look
in
Paul
's
wan
face
---
a
flush
---
a
smile
---
and
then
a
close
embrace
---
but
God
know
how
her
heart
leapt
up
at
this
rich
payment
for
her
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Floy
!
"
cry
her
brother
,
"
how
I
love
you
!
<EOS>
how
I
love
you
,
Floy
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
you
,
dear
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
I
be
sure
of
that
,
Floy
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
say
no
more
about
it
,
but
all
that
evening
sit
close
by
her
,
very
quiet
;
and
in
the
night
he
call
out
from
his
little
room
within
her
,
three
or
four
time
,
that
he
love
her
.
  
<EOS>
regularly
,
after
that
,
Florence
be
prepared
to
sit
down
with
Paul
on
Saturday
night
,
and
patiently
assist
him
through
so
much
as
they
could
anticipate
together
,
of
his
next
week
's
work
.
<EOS>
the
cheer
think
that
he
be
labour
on
where
Florence
have
just
toil
before
him
,
would
,
of
itself
,
have
be
a
stimulant
to
Paul
in
the
perpetual
resumption
of
his
study
;
but
couple
with
the
actual
lightening
of
his
load
,
consequent
on
this
assistance
,
it
save
him
,
possibly
,
from
sink
underneath
the
burden
which
the
fair
Cornelia
Blimber
pile
upon
his
back
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
Miss
Blimber
mean
to
be
too
hard
upon
him
,
or
that
Doctor
Blimber
mean
to
bear
too
heavily
on
the
young
gentleman
in
general
.
<EOS>
Cornelia
merely
hold
the
faith
in
which
she
have
be
breed
;
and
the
Doctor
,
in
some
partial
confusion
of
his
idea
,
regard
the
young
gentleman
as
if
they
be
all
doctor
,
and
be
bear
grow
up
.
<EOS>
comfort
by
the
applause
of
the
young
gentleman
's
near
relation
,
and
urge
on
by
their
blind
vanity
and
illconsidered
haste
,
it
would
have
be
strange
if
Doctor
Blimber
have
discover
his
mistake
,
or
trim
his
swell
sail
to
any
other
tack
.
  
<EOS>
thus
in
the
case
of
Paul
.
<EOS>
when
Doctor
Blimber
say
he
make
great
progress
,
and
be
naturally
clever
,
Mr
Dombey
be
more
bent
than
ever
on
his
be
force
and
cram
.
<EOS>
in
the
case
of
Briggs
,
when
Doctor
Blimber
report
that
he
do
not
make
great
progress
yet
,
and
be
not
naturally
clever
,
Briggs
senior
be
inexorable
in
the
same
purpose
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
however
high
and
false
the
temperature
at
which
the
Doctor
keep
his
hothouse
,
the
owner
of
the
plant
be
always
ready
to
lend
a
help
hand
at
the
bellow
,
and
to
stir
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
such
spirit
as
he
have
in
the
outset
,
Paul
soon
lose
of
course
.
<EOS>
but
he
retain
all
that
be
strange
,
and
old
,
and
thoughtful
to
the
in
his
character
:
and
under
circumstance
so
favourable
to
the
development
of
those
tendency
,
become
even
more
strange
,
and
old
,
and
thoughtful
,
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
difference
be
,
that
he
keep
his
character
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
grow
more
thoughtful
and
reserved
,
every
day
;
and
have
no
such
curiosity
in
any
live
member
of
the
Doctor
's
household
,
as
he
have
have
in
Mrs
Pipchin
.
<EOS>
He
love
to
be
alone
;
and
in
those
short
interval
when
he
be
not
occupy
with
his
book
,
like
nothing
so
well
as
wander
about
the
house
by
himself
,
or
sit
on
the
stair
,
listen
to
the
great
clock
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
He
be
intimate
with
all
the
paper
-
hanging
in
the
house
;
see
thing
that
no
one
else
see
in
the
pattern
;
find
out
miniature
tiger
and
lion
run
up
the
bedroom
wall
,
and
squinting
face
leer
in
the
square
and
diamond
of
the
floor
-
cloth
.
  
<EOS>
the
solitary
child
live
on
,
surround
by
this
arabesque
work
of
his
musing
fancy
,
and
no
one
understand
him
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Blimber
think
him
"
odd
,
"
and
sometimes
the
servant
say
among
themselves
that
little
Dombey
"
mope
;
"
but
that
be
all
.
  
<EOS>
unless
young
toot
have
some
idea
on
the
subject
,
to
the
expression
of
which
he
be
wholly
unequal
.
<EOS>
idea
,
like
ghost
(
accord
to
the
common
notion
of
ghost
)
,
must
be
speak
to
a
little
before
they
will
explain
themselves
;
and
toot
have
long
leave
off
ask
any
question
of
his
own
mind
.
<EOS>
some
mist
there
may
have
be
,
issue
from
that
leaden
casket
,
his
cranium
,
which
,
if
it
could
have
take
shape
and
form
,
would
have
become
a
genie
;
but
it
could
not
;
and
it
only
so
far
follow
the
example
of
the
smoke
in
the
arabian
story
,
as
to
roll
out
in
a
thick
cloud
,
and
there
hang
and
hover
.
<EOS>
but
it
leave
a
little
figure
visible
upon
a
lonely
shore
,
and
toot
be
always
stare
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
would
say
to
Paul
,
fifty
time
a
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
quite
well
,
Sir
,
thank
you
,
"
Paul
would
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
shake
hand
,
"
would
be
Toots
's
next
advance
.
  
<EOS>
which
Paul
,
of
course
,
would
immediately
do
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
generally
say
again
,
after
a
long
interval
of
stare
and
hard
breathing
,
"
how
be
you
?
"
<EOS>
to
which
Paul
again
reply
,
"
quite
well
,
Sir
,
thank
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
one
evening
Mr
Toots
be
sit
at
his
desk
,
oppress
by
correspondence
,
when
a
great
purpose
seem
to
flash
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
lay
down
his
pen
,
and
go
off
to
seek
Paul
,
whom
he
find
at
last
,
after
a
long
search
,
look
through
the
window
of
his
little
bedroom
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Toots
,
speak
the
moment
he
enter
the
room
,
lest
he
should
forget
it
;
"
what
do
you
think
about
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
I
think
about
a
great
many
thing
,
"
reply
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
,
though
?
"
say
toot
,
appear
to
consider
that
fact
in
itself
surprising
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
have
to
die
,
"
say
Paul
,
look
up
into
his
face
---
   
Mr
Toots
start
,
and
seem
much
disturb
.
  
<EOS>
"

do
not
you
think
you
would
rather
die
on
a
moonlight
night
when
the
sky
be
quite
clear
,
and
the
wind
blow
,
as
it
do
last
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
say
,
look
doubtfully
at
Paul
,
and
shake
his
head
,
that
he
do
not
know
about
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
blow
,
at
least
,
"
say
Paul
,
"
but
sound
in
the
air
like
the
sea
sound
in
the
shell

<EOS>
It
be
a
beautiful
night
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
listen
to
the
water
for
a
long
time
,
I
get
up
and
look
out
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
boat
over
there
,
in
the
full
light
of
the
moon

a
boat
with
a
sail

<EOS>
the
child
look
at
him
so
steadfastly
,
and
speak
so
earnestly
,
that
Mr
Toots
,
feel
himself
call
upon
to
say
something
about
this
boat
,
say
,
"
smuggler

"
<EOS>
but
with
an
impartial
remembrance
of
there
be
two
side
to
every
question

he
add

Preventive

<EOS>

a

with
a

repeat
Paul

in

<EOS>
the
sail
like
an
arm
,
all
silver

<EOS>
It
go
away
into
the
distance

and
what
do
you

it
seem
to
do
as
it
move
with
the
wave

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pitch

Mr

<EOS>
"
It

the

to

<EOS>
toot
be
almost
beside
himself
with
dismay
at
this
sudden
exclamation

good
night
<EOS>

good

"
  
<EOS>
His
quick
transition
to
a
state
of
unbounded
pleasure
,
as
he
stand
at
his
window
,
kiss
and
clap
his
hand
:
and
the
way
in
which
the
light
retreat
from
his
feature
as
she
pass
out
of
his
view
,
and
leave
a
patient
melancholy
on
the
little
face

be
too
remarkable
wholly
to
escape
even
Toots
's
notice

<EOS>
Their
interview
be
interrupt
at
this
moment
by
a
visit
from
Mrs
Pipchin
,
who
usually
bring
her
black
skirt
to
bear
upon
Paul
just
before
dusk
,
once
or
twice
a
week
,
toot
have
no
opportunity
of
improve
the
occasion

but
it
leave
so
mark
an
impression
on
his

that
he
twice
return
,

he
enter
no

than
by
slightly

mention

on
abstruse

be
throw
into
a
state
of
mortal
apprehension

not
foresee
where
he
may
break
out
,
or
what
authority
he
may
not
quote
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
Briggs
,
his
father
make
no
show
of
artifice
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
never
would
leave
him
alone
.
<EOS>
so
numerous
and
severe
be
the
mental
trial
of
that
unfortunate
youth
in

that
the

expectation

see
Master
Briggs

lie
on

<EOS>
Briggs
,
therefore
,
be
not
at
all
sanguine
on
the
subject

these
two
sharer

little
Paul

be
so
fair
a
sample

the
young

that
the

contemplate
the

festive

genteel

It
be
far
otherwise
with
little
Paul

<EOS>
the
end
of
these
first

his
separation

who
ever
look

the
end

the
grave

have
more

its
formal

go
roll

Mr

project
a
life

holiday

he
regularly
inform

every

it
be
his
"
last
half
"
at
Doctor
Blimber

,
and
he
be
go
to
begin
to
come
into
his
property
directly
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
perfectly
understand
between
Paul

they
be
intimate

notwithstanding
their
distance
in
point

harder

oftener

very

It

understand
by
Doctor

Mrs

Miss

as
well

by

young

somehow
constitute
himself
protector

guardian
of
Dombey

the
circumstance
become
so
notorious

even
to
Mrs
Pipchin

that
the
good
old
creature
cherish
feeling
of
bitterness
and
jealousy
against
toot

and
,
in
the
sanctuary
of
her
own
home
,
repeatedly
denounce
him
as
a
"
chuckle

the
innocent
Toots
have
no

than
he
have
of
any
other
definite
possibility
or
proposition

<EOS>
on
the
contrary

he
be
dispose
to
consider
her
rather
a
remarkable
character
,
with
many
point
of
interest
about
her
.
<EOS>
for
this
reason
he
smile
on
her
with
so
much
urbanity
,
and
ask
her
how
she
do
,
so
often
,
in
the
course
of
her
visit
to
little
Paul
,
that
at
last
she
one
night
tell
him
plainly
,
she
be
not
use
to
it
,
whatever
he
may
think
;
and
she
could
not
,
and
she
would
not
bear
it
,
either
from
himself
or
any
other
puppy
then
exist
:
<EOS>
at
which
unexpected
acknowledgment
of
his
civility
,
Mr
Toots
be
so
alarmed
that
he
secrete
himself
in
a
retired
spot
until
she
have
go
.
<EOS>
nor
do
he
ever
again
face
the
doughty
Mrs
Pipchin
,
under
Doctor
Blimber
's
roof
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
within
two

three

Analysis

resume
Miss

cast
her
eye
over
the
paper

of
the
character
of
P

"
I
find
that
the
natural
capacity
of
Dombey
be
extremely
good
;
and
that
his
general
disposition
to
study
may
be
state
in
an
equal
ratio

<EOS>
thus
,
take
eight
as
our
standard
and
high
number

I
find
these
quality
in

each
at
six
three

fourth

<EOS>
Miss

pause
to
see
how
Paul
receive
this
news

<EOS>
be
undecided
whether
six
three

six

fifteen

sixpence
three
farthing
,
or
six
foot
three
,
or

quarter

something

with

unknown
something
else
over

Paul
rub
his

and
look
straight
at
Miss

<EOS>
It
happen
to
answer
as
well
as
anything

he

do

violence

<EOS>
"
now
what
I
particularly
wish
to
call
your
attention
to
,
Dombey
,
be
the
general
observation
at
the
close
of
this
analysis
.
"
  
<EOS>
Paul
set
himself
to
follow
it
with
great
care
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
It
may
be
generally
observe
of
Dombey
,
"
"
say
Miss
Blimber
,
<EOS>
read
in
a
loud
voice
,
and
at
every
second
word
direct
her
spectacle
towards
the
little
figure
before
her
:
"
"
that
his
ability
and
inclination
be
good
,
and
that
he
have
make
as
much
progress
as
under
the
circumstance
could
have
be
expect
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
to
be
lament
of
this
young
gentleman
that
he
be
singular
(
what
be
usually
term
old
-
fashioned
)
in
his
character
and
conduct
,
and
that
without
present
anything
in
either
which
distinctly
call
for
reprobation
,
he
be
often
very
unlike
other
young
gentleman
of
his
age

social
position

<EOS>
"
now
,
Dombey
,
"

Miss

lay
down

do
you
understand

<EOS>

I
think
I
do

this
analysis

you
see

Dombey

Miss
Blimber
continue
,
be
go
to
be
send
home
to
your
respect
parent

<EOS>
It
will
naturally
be
very
painful
to
him
to
find
that
you
be
singular
in
your
character
and
conduct
.
<EOS>
It
be
naturally
painful
to
us
;
for
we
can
not
like
you

you
know

as
well
as
we
could
wish

"
  
<EOS>
She
touch
the
child
upon
a
tender
point
.
<EOS>
He
have
secretly
become
more
and
more
solicitous
from
day
to
day
,
as
the
time
of
his
departure
draw
more
near
,
that
all
the
house
should
like
him
.
<EOS>
from
some
hide
reason
,
very
imperfectly
understand
by
himself
---
if
understand
at
all
---
he
feel
a
gradually
increase
impulse
of
affection
,
towards
almost
everything
and
everybody
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
to
think
that
they
would
be
quite
indifferent
to
him
when
he
be
go
.
<EOS>
He
want
them
to
remember
him
kindly
;
and
he
have
make
it
his
business
even
to
conciliate
a
great
hoarse
shaggy
dog
,
chain
up
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
who
have
previously
be
the
terror
of
his
life
;
that
even
he
may
miss
him
when
he
be
no
longer
there
.
  
<EOS>
little
thinking
that
in
this
,
he
only
show
again
the
difference
between
himself
and
his
compeer
<EOS>
,
poor
tiny
Paul
set
it
forth
to
Miss
Blimber
as
well
as
he
could
,
and
beg
her
,
in
despite
of
the
official
analysis
,
to
have
the
goodness
to
try
and
like
him
.
<EOS>
to
Mrs
Blimber
,
who
have
join
them
,
he
prefer
the
same
petition
:
and
when
that
lady
could
not
forbear
,
even
in
his
presence
,
from
give
utterance
to
her
often
-
repeat
opinion
,
that
he
be
an
odd
child
,
Paul
tell
her
that
he
be
sure
she
be
quite
right
;
that
he
think
it
must
be
his
bone
,
but
he
do
not
know
;
and
that
he
hope
she
would
overlook
it
,
for
he
be
fond
of
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
so
fond
,
"
say
Paul
,
with
a
mixture
of
timidity
and
perfect
frankness
,
which
be
one
of
the
most
peculiar
and
most
engaging
quality
of
the
child
,
"
not
so
fond
as
I
be
of
Florence
,
of
course
;
that
could
never
be
.
<EOS>
You
could
not
expect
that
,
could
you
,
madam

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
the
old
-
fashioned
little
soul
!
"
cry
Mrs
Blimber
,
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
like
everybody
here
very
much
,
"
pursue
Paul
,
"
and
I
should
grieve
to
go
away
,
and
think
that
any
one
be
glad
that
I
be
go
,
or
do
not
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Blimber
be
now
quite
sure
that
Paul
be
the
odd
child
in
the
world
;
and
when
she
tell
the
Doctor
what
have
pass
,
the
Doctor
do
not
controvert
his
wife
's
opinion
.
<EOS>
but
he
say
,
as
he
have
say
before
,
when
Paul
first
come
,
that
study
would
do
much
;
and
he
also
say
,
as
he
have
say
on
that
occasion
,
"
bring
him
on
,
Cornelia
!
<EOS>
bring
him
on
!
"
  
<EOS>
Cornelia
have
always
bring
him
on
as
vigorously
as
she
could
;
and
Paul
have
have
a
hard
life
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
over
and
above
the
get
through
his
task
,
he
have
long
have
another
purpose
always
present
to
him
,
and
to
which
he
still
hold
fast
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
to
be
a
gentle
,
useful
,
quiet
little
fellow
,
always
strive
to
secure
the
love
and
attachment
of
the
rest
;
and
though
he
be
yet
often
to
be
see
at
his
old
post
on
the
stair
,
or
watch
the
wave
and
cloud
from
his
solitary
window
,
he
be
oftener
find
,
too
,
among
the
other
boy
,
modestly
render
them
some
little
voluntary
service
.
<EOS>
thus
it
come
to
pass
,
that
even
among
those
rigid
and
absorb
young
anchorite
,
who
mortify
themselves
beneath
the
roof
of
Doctor
Blimber
,
Paul
be
an
object
of
general
interest
;
a
fragile
little
plaything
that
they
all
like
,
and
that
no
one
would
have
think
of
treat
roughly
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
change
his
nature
,
or
re
-
write
the
analysis
;
and
so
they
all
agree
that
Dombey
be
old
-
fashioned
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
some
immunity
,
however
,
attach
to
the
character
enjoy
by
no
one
else
.
<EOS>
They
could
have
better
spare
a
newer
-
fashioned
child
,
and
that
alone
be
much
.
<EOS>
when
the
other
only
bow
to
Doctor
Blimber
and
family
on
retire
for
the
night
,
Paul
would
stretch
out
his
morsel
of
a
hand
,
and
boldly
shake
the
Doctor
's
;
also
Mrs
Blimber
's
;
also
Cornelia
's
.
<EOS>
if
anybody
be
to
be
beg
off
from
impending
punishment
,
Paul
be
always
the
delegate
.
<EOS>
the
weak
-
eyed
young
man
himself
have
once
consult
him
,
in
reference
to
a
little
breakage
of
glass
and
china
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
darkly
rumour
that
the
butler
,
regard
him
with
favour
such
as
that
stern
man
have
never
show
before
to
mortal
boy
,
have
sometimes
mingle
porter
with
his
table
-
beer
to
make
him
strong
.
  
<EOS>
over
and
above
these
extensive
privilege
,
Paul
have
free
right
of
entry
to
Mr
Feeder
's
room
,
from
which
apartment
he
have
twice
lead
Mr
Toots
into
the
open
air
in
a
state
of
faintness
,
consequent
on
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
smoke
a
very
blunt
cigar
:
one
of
a
bundle
which
that
young
gentleman
have
covertly
purchase
on
the
shingle
from
a
most
desperate
smuggler
,
who
have
acknowledge
,
in
confidence
,
that
two
hundred
pound
be
the
price
set
upon
his
head
,
dead
or
alive
,
by
the
Custom
House
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
snug
room
,
Mr
Feeder
's
,
with
his
bed
in
another
little
room
inside
of
it
;
and
a
flute
,
which
Mr
Feeder
could
not
play
yet
,
but
be
go
to
make
a
point
of
learning
,
he
say
,
hang
up
over
the
fireplace
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
book
in
it
,
too
,
and
a
fishing
-
rod
;
for
Mr
Feeder
say
he
should
certainly
make
a
point
of
learn
to
fish
,
when
he
could
find
time
.
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
have
amass
,
with
similar
intention
,
a
beautiful
little
curly
secondhand
key
-
bugle
,
a
chess
-
board
and
man
,
a
Spanish
Grammar
,
a
set
of
sketching
material
,
and
a
pair
of
boxing
-
glove
.
<EOS>
the
art
of
self
-
defence
Mr
Feeder
say
he
should
undoubtedly
make
a
point
of
learning
,
as
he
consider
it
the
duty
of
every
man
to
do
;
for
it
may
lead
to
the
protection
of
a
female
in
distress
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mr
Feeder
's
great
possession
be
a
large
green
jar
of
snuff
,
which
Mr
Toots
have
bring
down
as
a
present
,
at
the
close
of
the
last
vacation
;
and
for
which
he
have
pay
a
high
price
,
as
have
be
the
genuine
property
of
the
Prince
Regent
.
<EOS>
neither
Mr
Toots
not
Mr
Feeder
could
partake
of
this
or
any
other
snuff
,
even
in
the
most
stinted
and
moderate
degree
,
without
be
seize
with
convulsion
of
sneeze
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
it
be
their
great
delight
to
moisten
a
box
-
full
with
cold
tea
,
stir
it
up
on
a
piece
of
parchment
with
a
paper
-
knife
,
and
devote
themselves
to
its
consumption
then
and
there
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
which
cram
of
their
nose
,
they
endure
surprising
torment
with
the
constancy
of
martyr
:
and
,
drink
table
-
beer
at
interval
,
feel
all
the
glory
of
dissipation
.
  
<EOS>
to
little
Paul
sit
silent
in
their
company
,
and
by
the
side
of
his
chief
patron
,
Mr
Toots
,
there
be
a
dread
charm
in
these
reckless
occasion
:
and
when
Mr
Feeder
speak
of
the
dark
mystery
of
London
,
and
tell
Mr
Toots
that
he
be
go
to
observe
it
himself
closely
in
all
its
ramification
in
the
approach
holiday
,
and
for
that
purpose
have
make
arrangement
to
board
with
two
old
maiden

Peckham
,
Paul
regard
him
as
if
he
be
the
hero
of
some
book
of
travel
or
wild
adventure
,
and
be
almost
afraid
of
such
a

one
evening

when
the

,
that

if

.
<EOS>
Mr

to

that
he
would
be
expect
to
inform

,
in
superfine
small
-

<EOS>

,
Mr

say
,
he
have
well
not
refer
to
the
festive
occasion
,
in
the
hearing
of
Doctor
and
Mrs
Blimber
;
as
these
preliminary
,
and
the
whole
of
the
arrangement
,
be
conduct
on
principle
of
classicality
and
high
breeding
;
and
that
Doctor
and
Mrs
Blimber
on
the
one
hand
,
and
the
young
gentleman
on
the
other
,
be
suppose
,
in
their
scholastic
capacity
,
not
to
have
the
least
idea
of
what
be
in
the
wind
.
  
<EOS>
Paul
thank
Mr
Feeder
for
these
hint
,
and
pocket
his
invitation
,
sit
down
on
a
stool
by
the
side
of
Mr
Toots
as
usual
.
<EOS>
but
Paul
's
head
,
which
have
long
be
ail
more
or
less
,
and
be
sometimes
very
heavy
and
painful
,
feel
so
uneasy
that
night
,
that
he
be
oblige
to
support
it
on
his
hand
.
<EOS>
and
yet
it
drop
so
,
that
by
little
and
little
it
sink
on
Mr
Toots
's
knee
,
and
rest
there
,
as
if
it
have
no
care
to
be
ever
lift
up
again
.
  
<EOS>
that
be
no
reason
why
he
should
be
deaf
,
but
he
must
have
be
,
he
think
,
for
,
by
and
by
<EOS>
,
he
hear
Mr
Feeder
call
in
his
ear
,
and
gently
shake
him
to
rouse
his
attention
.
<EOS>
and
when
he
raise
his
head
,
quite
scared
,
and
look
about
him
<EOS>
,
he
find
that
Doctor
Blimber
have
come
into
the
room
;
and
that
the
window
be
open
,
and
that
his
forehead
be
wet
with
sprinkled
water
;
though
how
all
this
have
be
do
without
his
knowledge
,
be
very
curious
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
come
,
come
!
<EOS>
that
be
well
!
<EOS>
how
be
my
little
friend
now
?
"
say
Doctor
Blimber
,
encouragingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
quite
well
,
thank
you
,
Sir
,
"
say
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
seem
to
be
something
the
matter
with
the
floor
,
for
he
could
not
stand
upon
it
steadily
;
and
with
the
wall
too
,
for
they
be
incline
to
turn
round
and
round
,
and
could
only
be
stop
by
be
look
at
very
hard
indeed
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
's
head
have
the
appearance
of
be
at
once
big
and
farther
off
than
be
quite
natural
:
and
when
he
take
Paul
in
his
arm
,
to
carry
him
up
stair
,
Paul
observe
with
astonishment
that
the
door
be
in
quite
a
different
place
from
that
in
which
he
have
expect
to
find
it
,
and
almost
think
,
at
first
,
that
Mr
Toots
be
go
to
walk
straight
up
the
chimney
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
kind
of
Mr
Toots
to
carry
him
to
the
top
of
the
house
so
tenderly
;
and
Paul
tell
him
that
it
be
.
<EOS>
but
Mr
Toots
say
he
would
do
a
great
deal
more
than
that
,
if
he
could
;
and
indeed
he
do
more
as
it
be
:
for
he
help
Paul
to
undress
,
and
help
him
to
bed
,
in
the
kind
manner
possible
,
and
then
sit
down
by
the
bedside
and
chuckle
very
much
;
while
Mr
Feeder
,
BA
,
lean
over
the
bottom
of
the
bedstead
,
set
all
the
little
bristle
on
his
head
bolt
upright
with
his
bony
hand
,
and
then
make
believe
to
spar
at
Paul
with
great
science
,
on
account
of
his
be
all
right
again
,
which
be
so
uncommonly
facetious
,
and
kind
too
in
Mr
Feeder
,
that
Paul
,
not
be
able
to
make
up
his
mind
whether
it
be
good
to
laugh
or
cry
at
him
,
do
both
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
how
Mr
toot
melt
away
,
and
Mr
Feeder
change
into
Mrs
Pipchin
,
Paul
never
think
of
ask
;
neither
be
he
at
all
curious
to
know
;
but
when
he
see
Mrs
Pipchin
stand
at
the
bottom
of
the
bed
,
instead
of
Mr
Feeder
,
he
cry
out
,
"
Mrs
Pipchin
,
do
not
tell
Florence
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
tell
Florence
<EOS>
what
,
my
little
Paul
?
"
say
Mrs
Pipchin
,
come
round
to
the
bedside
,
and
sit
down
in
the
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
about
me
,
"
say
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
Mrs
Pipchin
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
I
mean
to
do
when
I
grow
up
,
Mrs
Pipchin
?
"
inquire
Paul
,
turn
his
face
towards
her
on
his
pillow
,
and
rest
his
chin
wistfully
on
his
folded
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
could
not
guess
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
"
say
Paul
,
"
to
put
my
money
all
together
in
one
Bank
,
never
try
to
get
any
more
,
go
away
into
the
country
with
my
darling
Florence
,
have
a
beautiful
garden
,
field
,
and
wood
,
and
live
there
with
her
all
my
life
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
indeed
!
"
cry
Mrs
Pipchin
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Paul
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
what
I
mean
to
do
,
when
I
---
"
He
stop
,
and
ponder
for
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
's
grey
eye
scan
his
thoughtful
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
grow
up
,
"
say
Paul
.
<EOS>
then
he
go
on
immediately
to
tell
Mrs
Pipchin
all
about
the
party
,
about
Florence
's
invitation
,
about
the
pride
he
would
have
in
the
admiration
that
would
be
feel
for
her
by
all
the
boy
,
about
their
be
so
kind
to
him
and
fond
of
him
,
about
his
be
so
fond
of
them
,
and
about
his
be
so
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
then
he
tell
Mrs
Pipchin
about
the
analysis
,
and
about
his
be
certainly
old
-
fashioned
,
and
take
Mrs
Pipchin
's
opinion
on
that
point
,
and
whether
she
know
why
it
be
,
and
what
it
mean
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
deny
the
fact
altogether
,
as
the
short
way
of
get
out
of
the
difficulty
;
but
Paul
be
far
from
satisfied
with
that
reply
,
and
look
so
searchingly
at
Mrs
Pipchin
for
a
truer
answer
,
that
she
be
oblige
to
get
up
and
look
out
of
the
window
to
avoid
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
certain
calm
Apothecary
,
who
attend
at
the
establishment
when
any
of
the
young
gentleman
be
ill
,
and
somehow
he
get
into
the
room
and
appear
at
the
bedside
,
with
Mrs
Blimber
.
<EOS>
how
they
come
there
,
or
how
long
they
have
be
there
,
Paul
do
not
know
;
but
when
he
see
them
,
he
sit
up
in
bed
,
and
answer
all
the
Apothecary
's
question
at
full
length
,
and
whisper
to
him
that
Florence
be
not
to
know
anything
about
it
,
if
he
please
,
and
that
he
have
set
his
mind
upon
her
come
to
the
party
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
chatty
with
the
Apothecary
,
and
they
part
excellent
friend
.
<EOS>
lie
down
again
with
his
eye
shut
,
he
hear
the
Apothecary
say
,
out
of
the
room
and
quite
a
long
way
off
---
or
he
dream
it
---
that
there
be
a
want
of
vital
power
(
what
be
that
,
Paul
wonder
)
and
great
constitutional
weakness
.
<EOS>
that
as
the
little
fellow
have
set
his
heart
on
part
with
his
school
-
mate
on
the
seventeenth
,
it
would
be
well
to
indulge
the
fancy
if
he
grow
no
bad
.
<EOS>
that
he
be
glad
to
hear
from
Mrs
Pipchin
,
that
the
little
fellow
would
go
to
his
friend
in
London
on
the
eighteenth
.
<EOS>
that
he
would
write
to
Mr
Dombey
,
when
he
should
have
gain
a
well
knowledge
of
the
case
,
and
before
that
day
.
<EOS>
that
there
be
no
immediate
cause
for
---
<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
Paul
lose
that
word
.
<EOS>
and
that
the
little
fellow
have
a
fine
mind
,
but
be
an
old
-
fashioned
boy
.
  
<EOS>
what
old
fashion
could
that
be
,
Paul
wonder
with
a
palpitate
heart
,
that
be
so
visibly
express
in
him
;
so
plainly
see
by
so
many
people
!
  
<EOS>
He
could
neither
make
it
out
,
not
trouble
himself
long
with
the
effort
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
be
again
beside
him
,
if
she
have
ever
be
away
(
he
think
she
have
go
out
with
the
Doctor
,
but
it
be
all
a
dream
perhaps
)
,
and
presently
a
bottle
and
glass
get
into
her
hand
magically
,
and
she
pour
out
the
content
for
him
.
<EOS>
after
that
,
he
have
some
real
good
jelly
,
which
Mrs
Blimber
bring
to
him
herself
;
and
then
he
be
so
well
,
that
Mrs
Pipchin
go
home
,
at
his
urgent
solicitation
,
and
Briggs
and
Tozer
come
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Poor
Briggs
grumble
terribly
about
his
own
analysis
,
which
could
hardly
have
discompose
him
more
if
it
have
be
a
chemical
process
;
but
he
be
very
good
to
Paul
,
and
so
be
Tozer
,
and
so
be
all
the
rest
,
for
they
everyone
look
in
before
go
to
bed
,
and
say
,
"
how
be
you
now
,
Dombey
?
"
<EOS>
"
cheer
up
,
little
dombey
!
"
<EOS>
and
so
forth
.
<EOS>
after
Briggs
have
get
into
bed
,
he
lie
awake
for
a
long
time
,
still
bemoan
his
analysis
,
and
say
he
know
it
be
all
wrong
,
and
they
could
not
have
analyse
a
murderer
bad
,
and
how
would
doctor
Blimber
like
it
if
his
pocket
-
money
depend
on
it
?
<EOS>
It
be
very
easy
,
Briggs
say
,
to
make
a
galley
-
slave
of
a
boy
all
the
half
-
year
,
and
then
score
him
up
idle
;
and
to
crib
two
dinner
a
-
week
out
of
his
board
,
and
then
score
him
up
greedy
:
but
that
be
not
go
to
be
submit
to
,
he
believe
,
be
it
?
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
ah
!
  
<EOS>
before
the
weak
-
eyed
young
man
perform
on
the
gong
next
morning
,
he
come
up
stair
to
Paul
and
tell
him
he
be
to
lie
still
,
which
Paul
very
gladly
do
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Pipchin
reappear
a
little
before
the
Apothecary
,
and
a
little
after
the
good
young
woman
whom
Paul
have
see
clean
the
stove
on
that
first
morning
(
how
long
ago
it
seem
now
!
)
<EOS>
have
bring
him
his
breakfast
.
<EOS>
there
be
another
consultation
a
long
way
off
,
or
else
Paul
dream
it
again
;
and
then
the
Apothecary
,
come
back
with
Doctor
and
Mrs
Blimber
,
say
:
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
I
think
,
Doctor
Blimber
,
we
may
release
this
young
gentleman
from
his
book
just
now
;
the
vacation
be
so
very
near
at
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
by
all
mean
,
"
say
Doctor
Blimber
.
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
you
will
inform
Cornelia
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
assuredly
,
"
say
Mrs
Blimber
.
  
<EOS>
the
Apothecary
bend
down
,
look
closely
into
Paul
's
eye
,
and
feel
his
head
,
and
his
pulse
,
and
his
heart
,
with
so
much
interest
and
care
,
that
Paul
say
,
"
thank
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Our
little
friend
,
"
observe
Doctor
Blimber
,
"
have
never
complain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
no
!
"
reply
the
Apothecary
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
not
likely
to
complain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
find
him
greatly
better
?
"
say
Doctor
Blimber
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
he
be
greatly
well
,
Sir
,
"
return
the
Apothecary
.
  
<EOS>
Paul
have
begin
to
speculate
,
in
his
own
odd
way
,
on
the
subject
that
may
occupy
the
Apothecary
's
mind
just
at
that
moment
;
so
musingly
have
he
answer
the
two
question
of
Doctor
Blimber
.
<EOS>
but
the
Apothecary
happen
to
meet
his
little
patient
's
eye
,
as
the
latter
set
off
on
that
mental
expedition
,
and
come
instantly
out
of
his
abstraction
with
a
cheerful
smile
,
Paul
smile
in
return
and
abandon
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
lie
in
bed
all
that
day
,
doze
and
dream
,
and
look
at
Mr
Toots
:
but
get
up
on
the
next
,
and
go
down
stair
.
<EOS>
Lo
and
behold
,
there
be
something
the
matter
with
the
great
clock
;
and
a
workman
on
a
pair
of
step
have
take
its
face
off
,
and
be
poke
instrument
into
the
work
by
the
light
of
a
candle
!
<EOS>
this
be
a
great
event
for
Paul
,
who
sit
down
on
the
bottom
stair
,
and
watch
the
operation
attentively
:
now
and
then
glance
at
the
clock
face
,
lean
all
askew
,
against
the
wall
hard
by
,
and
feel
a
little
confused
by
a
suspicion
that
it
be
ogle
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
workman
on
the
step
be
very
civil
;
and
as
he
say
,
when
he
observe
Paul
,
"
how
do
you
do
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
Paul
get
into
conversation
with
him
,
and
tell
him
he
have
not
be
quite
well
lately
.
<EOS>
the
ice
be
thus
break
,
Paul
ask
him
a
multitude
of
question
about
chime
and
clock
:
as
,
whether
people
watch
up
in
the
lonely
church
steeple
by
night
to
make
them
strike
,
and
how
the
bell
be
ring
when
people
die
,
and
whether
those
be
different
bell
from
wedding
bell
,
or
only
sound
dismal
in
the
fancy
of
the
living
.
<EOS>
find
that
his
new
acquaintance
be
not
very
well
informed
on
the
subject
of
the
Curfew
Bell
of
ancient
day
,
Paul
give
him
an
account
of
that
institution
;
and
also
ask
him
,
as
a
practical
man
,
what
he
think
about
King
Alfred
's
idea
of
measure
time
by
the
burning
of
candle
;
to
which
the
workman
reply
,
that
he
think
it
would
be
the
ruin
of
the
clock
trade
if
it
be
to
come
up
again
.
<EOS>
in
fine
,
Paul
look
on
,
until
the
clock
have
quite
recover
its
familiar
aspect
,
and
resume
its
sedate
inquiry
:
when
the
workman
,
put
away
his
tool
in
a
long
basket
,
bade
him
good
day
,
and
go
away
.
<EOS>
though
not
before
he
have
whisper
something
,
on
the
door
-
mat
,
to
the
footman
,
in
which
there
be
the
phrase
"
old
-
fashioned
"
---
for
Paul
hear
it
.
  
<EOS>
what
could
that
old
fashion
be
,
that
seem
to
make
the
people
sorry
!
<EOS>
what
could
it
be
!
  
<EOS>
have
nothing
to
learn
now
,
he
think
of
this
frequently
;
though
not
so
often
as
he
may
have
do
,
if
he
have
have
few
thing
to
think
of
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
a
great
many
;
and
be
always
think
,
all
day
long
.
  
<EOS>
first
,
there
be
Florence
come
to
the
party
.
<EOS>
Florence
would
see
that
the
boy
be
fond
of
him
;
and
that
would
make
her
happy
.
<EOS>
this
be
his
great
theme
.
<EOS>
let
Florence
once
be
sure
that
they
be
gentle
and
good
to
him
,
and
that
he
have
become
a
little
favourite
among
them
,
and
then
she
would
always
think
of
the
time
he
have
pass
there
,
without
be
very
sorry
.
<EOS>
Florence
may
be
all
the
happy
too
for
that
perhaps
,
when
he
come
back
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
come
back
!
<EOS>
fifty
time
a
day
,
his
noiseless
little
foot
go
up
the
stair
to
his
own
room
,
as
he
collect
every
book
and
scrap
,
and
trifle
that
belong
to
him
,
and
put
them
all
together
there
,
down
to
the
minute
thing
,
for
take
home!there
be
no
shade
of
come
back
on
little
Paul
;
<EOS>
no
preparation
for
it
,
or
other
reference
to
it
,
grow
out
of
anything
he
think
or
do
,
except
this
slight
one
in
connexion
with
his
sister
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
he
have
to
think
of
everything
familiar
to
him
,
in
his
contemplative
mood
and
in
his
wandering
about
the
house
,
as
be
to
be
part
with
;
and
hence
the
many
thing
he
have
to
think
of
,
all
day
long
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
to
peep
into
those
room
up
-
stair
,
and
think
how
solitary
they
would
be
when
he
be
go
,
and
wonder
through
how
many
silent
day
,
week
,
month
,
and
year
,
they
would
continue
just
as
grave
and
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
He
have
to
think
---
would
any
other
child
(
old
-
fashioned
,
like
himself
)
stray
there
at
any
time
,
to
whom
the
same
grotesque
distortion
of
pattern
and
furniture
would
manifest
themselves
;
and
would
anybody
tell
that
boy
of
little
Dombey
,
who
have
be
there
once
?
  
<EOS>
He
have
to
think
of
a
portrait
on
the
stair
,
which
always
look
earnestly
after
him
as
he
go
away
,
eye
it
over
his
shoulder
:
and
which
,
when
he
pass
it
in
the
company
of
any
one
,
still
seem
to
gaze
at
him
,
and
not
at
his
companion
.
<EOS>
He
have
much
to
think
of
,
in
association
with
a
print
that
hang
up
in
another
place
,
where
,
in
the
centre
of
a
wonder
group
,
one
figure
that
he
know
,
a
figure
with
a
light
about
its
head
---
benignant
,
mild
,
and
merciful
---
stand
point
upward
.
  
<EOS>
at
his
own
bedroom
window
,
there
be
crowd
of
thought
that
mix
with
these
,
and
come
on
,
one
upon
another
,
like
the
rolling
wave
.
<EOS>
where
those
wild
bird
live
,
that
be
always
hover
out
at
sea
in
troubled
weather
;
where
the
cloud
rise
and
first
begin
;
whence
<EOS>
the
wind
issue
on
its
rush
flight
,
and
where
it
stop
;
whether
the
spot
where
he
and
Florence
have
so
often
sit
,
and
watch
,
and
talk
about
these
thing
,
could
ever
be
exactly
as
it
use
to
be
without
them
;
whether
it
could
ever
be
the
same
to
Florence
,
if
he
be
in
some
distant
place
,
and
she
be
sit
there
alone
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
to
think
,
too
,
of
Mr
Toots
,
and
Mr
Feeder
,
BA
;
of
all
the
boy
;
and
of
Doctor
Blimber
,
Mrs
Blimber
,
and
Miss
Blimber
;
of
home
,
and
of
his
aunt
and
Miss
Tox
;
of
his
father
,
Dombey
and
Son
,
Walter
with
the
poor
old
uncle
who
have
get
the
money
he
want
,
and
that
gruff
-
voice
Captain
with
the
iron
hand
.
<EOS>
besides
all
this
,
he
have
a
number
of
little
visit
to
pay
,
in
the
course
of
the
day
;
to
the
schoolroom
,
to
Doctor
Blimber
's
study
,
to
Mrs
Blimber
's
private
a
apartment
,
to
Miss
Blimber
's
,
and
to
the
dog
.
<EOS>
for
he
be
free
of
the
whole
house
now
,
to
range
it
as
he
choose
;
and
,
in
his
desire
to
part
with
everybody
on
affectionate
term
,
he
attend
,
in
his
way
,
to
them
all
.
<EOS>
sometimes
he
find
place
in
book
for
Briggs
,
who
be
always
lose
them
;
sometimes
he
look
up
word
in
dictionary
for
other
young
gentleman
who
be
in
extremity
;
sometimes
he
hold
skein
of
silk
for
Mrs
Blimber
to
wind
;
sometimes
he
put
Cornelia
's
desk
to
right
;
sometimes
he
would
even
creep
into
the
Doctor
's
study
,
and
,
sit
on
the
carpet
near
his
learned
foot
,
turn
the
globe
softly
,
and
go
round
the
world
,
or
take
a
flight
among
the
far
-
off
star
.
  
<EOS>
in
those
day
immediately
before
the
holiday
,
in
short
,
when
the
other
young
gentleman
be
labour
for
dear
life
through
a
general
resumption
of
the
study
of
the
whole
half
-
year
,
Paul
be
such
a
privileged
pupil
as
have
never
be
see
in
that
house
before
.
<EOS>
He
could
hardly
believe
it
himself
;
but
his
liberty
last
from
hour
to
hour
,
and
from
day
to
day
;
and
little
Dombey
be
caress
by
everyone
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Blimber
be
so
particular
about
him
,
that
he
request
Johnson
to
retire
from
the
dinner
-
table
one
day
,
for
have
thoughtlessly
speak
to
him
as
"
poor
little
Dombey
;
"
which
Paul
think
rather
hard
and
severe
,
though
he
have
flush
at
the
moment
,
and
wonder
why
Johnson
should
pity
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
more
questionable
justice
,
Paul
think
,
in
the
Doctor
,
from
his
have
certainly
overhear
that
great
authority
give
his
assent
on
the
previous
evening
,
to
the
proposition
(
state
by
Mrs
Blimber
)
that
poor
dear
little
Dombey
be
more
old
-
fashioned
than
ever
.
<EOS>
and
now
it
be
that
Paul
begin
to
think
it
must
surely
be
old
-
fashioned
to
be
very
thin
,
and
light
,
and
easily
tired
,
and
soon
dispose
to
lie
down
anywhere
and
rest
;
for
he
could
not
help
feel
that
these
be
more
and
more
his
habit
every
day
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
the
party
-
day
arrive
;
and
Doctor
Blimber
say
at
breakfast
,
"
gentleman
,
we
will
resume
our
study
on
the
twenty
-
fifth
of
next
month
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
toot
immediately
throw
off
his
allegiance
,
and
put
on
his
ring
:
and
mention
the
Doctor
in
casual
conversation
shortly
afterwards
,
speak
of
him
as
"
Blimber
!
"
<EOS>
this
act
of
freedom
inspire
the
old
pupil
with
admiration
and
envy
;
but
the
young
spirit
be
appal
,
and
seem
to
marvel
that
no
beam
fall
down
and
crush
him
.
  
<EOS>
not
the
least
allusion
be
make
to
the
ceremony
of
the
evening
,
either
at
breakfast
or
at
dinner
;
but
there
be
a
bustle
in
the
house
all
day
,
and
in
the
course
of
his
perambulation
,
Paul
make
acquaintance
with
various
strange
bench
and
candlestick
,
and
meet
a
harp
in
a
green
greatcoat
stand
on
the
landing
outside
the
drawing
-
room
door
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
queer
,
too
,
about
Mrs
Blimber
's
head
at
dinner
-
time
,
as
if
she
have
screw
her
hair
up
too
tight
;
and
though
Miss
Blimber
show
a
graceful
bunch
of
plaited
hair
on
each
temple
,
she
seem
to
have
her
own
little
curl
in
paper
underneath
,
and
in
a
play
-
bill
too
:
for
Paul
read
"
Theatre
Royal
"
over
one
of
her
sparkling
spectacle
,
and
"
Brighton
"
over
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
grand
array
of
white
waistcoat
and
cravat
in
the
young
gentleman
's
bedroom
as
evening
approach
;
and
such
a
smell
of
singed
hair
,
that
Doctor
Blimber
send
up
the
footman
with
his
compliment
,
and
wish
to
know
if
the
house
be
on
fire
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
only
the
hairdresser
curl
the
young
gentleman
,
and
over
-
heat
his
tong
in
the
ardour
of
business
.
  
<EOS>
when
Paul
be
dress
---
which
be
very
soon
do
,
for
he
feel
unwell
and
drowsy
,
and
be
not
able
to
stand
about
it
very
long
---
he
go
down
into
the
drawing
-
room
;
where
he
find
Doctor
Blimber
pace
up
and
down
the
room
full
dress
,
but
with
a
dignified
and
unconcerned
demeanour
,
as
if
he
think
it
barely
possible
that
one
or
two
people
may
drop
in
by
and
by
.
<EOS>
shortly
afterwards
,
Mrs
Blimber
appear
,
look
lovely
,
Paul
think
;
and
attire
in
such
a
number
of
skirt
that
it
be
quite
an
excursion
to
walk
round
her
.
<EOS>
Miss
Blimber
come
down
soon
after
her
mama
;
a
little
squeeze
in
appearance
,
but
very
charming
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
and
Mr
Feeder
be
the
next
arrival
.
<EOS>
each
of
these
gentleman
bring
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
as
if
he
live
somewhere
else
;
and
when
they
be
announce
by
the
butler
,
Doctor
Blimber
say
,
"
aye
,
aye
,
aye
!
<EOS>
God
bless
my
soul
!
"
and
seem
extremely
glad
to
see
them
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
be
one
blaze
of
jewellery
and
button
:
and
he
feel
the
circumstance
so
strongly
,
that
when
he
have
shake
hand
with
the
doctor
,
and
have
bow
to
Mrs
Blimber
and
Miss
Blimber
,
he
take
Paul
aside
,
and
say
,
"
what
do
you
think
of
this
,
Dombey
?
"
  
<EOS>
but
notwithstanding
this
modest
confidence
in
himself
,
Mr
Toots
appear
to
be
involve
in
a
good
deal
of
uncertainty
whether
,
on
the
whole
,
it
be
judicious
to
button
the
bottom
button
of
his
waistcoat
,
and
whether
,
on
a
calm
revision
of
all
the
circumstance
,
it
be
good
to
wear
his
wristband
turn
up
or
turn
down
.
<EOS>
observe
that
Mr
Feeder
's
be
turn
up
,
Mr
Toots
turn
his
up
;
but
the
wristband
of
the
next
arrival
be
turn
down
,
Mr
Toots
turn
his
down
.
<EOS>
the
difference
in
point
of
waistcoat
buttoning
,
not
only
at
the
bottom
,
but
at
the
top
too
,
become
so
numerous
and
complicated
as
the
arrival
thicken
,
that
Mr
Toots
be
continually
finger
that
article
of
dress
,
as
if
he
be
perform
on
some
instrument
;
and
appear
to
find
the
incessant
execution
it
demand
,
quite
bewildering
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
young
gentleman
,
tightly
cravatte
,
curl
,
and
pump
,
and
with
their
good
hat
in
their
hand
,
have
be
at
different
time
announce
and
introduce
,
Mr
Baps
,
the
dancing
-
master
,
come
,
accompany
by
Mrs
Baps
,
to
whom
Mrs
Blimber
be
extremely
kind
and
condescend
.
<EOS>
Mr
Baps
be
a
very
gentleman
,
with
a
slow
and
measured
manner
of
speak
;
and
before
he
have
stand
under
the
lamp
five
minute
,
he
begin
to
talk
to
toot
(
who
have
be
silently
compare
pump
with
him
)
about
what
you
be
to
do
with
your
raw
material
when
they
come
into
your
port
in
return
for
your
drain
of
gold
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
,
to
whom
the
question
seem
perplexing
,
suggest
"
Cook
'
em
.
"
<EOS>
but
Mr
Baps
do
not
appear
to
think
that
would
do
.
  
<EOS>
Paul
now
slip
away
from
the
cushioned
corner
of
a
sofa
,
which
have
be
his
post
of
observation
,
and
go
down
stair
into
the
tea
-
room
to
be
ready
for
Florence
,
whom
he
have
not
see
for
nearly
a
fortnight
,
as
he
have
remain
at
Doctor
Blimber
's
on
the
previous
Saturday
and
Sunday
,
lest
he
should
take
cold
.
<EOS>
presently
she
come
:
look
so
beautiful
in
her
simple
ball
dress
,
with
her
fresh
flower
in
her
hand
,
that
when
she
kneel
down
on
the
ground
to
take
Paul
round
the
neck
and
kiss
him
<EOS>
(
for
there
be
no
one
there
,
but
his
friend
and
another
young
woman
wait
to
serve
out
the
tea
)
,
he
could
hardly
make
up
his
mind
to
let
her
go
again
,
or
to
take
away
her
bright
and
loving
eye
from
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
be
the
matter
,
Floy
?
"
ask
Paul
,
almost
sure
that
he
see
a
tear
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
,
darling
;
nothing
,
"
return
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
Paul
touch
her
cheek
gently
with
his
finger
---
and
it
be
a
tear
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
,
Floy
!
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
go
home
together
,
and
I
will
nurse
you
,
love
,
"
say
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
nurse
me
!
"
echo
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
Paul
could
not
understand
what
that
have
to
do
with
it
,
not
why
the
two
young
woman
look
on
so
seriously
,
nor
why
Florence
turn
away
her
face
for
a
moment
,
and
then
turn
it
back
,
light
up
again
with
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Floy
,
"
say
Paul
,
hold
a
ringlet
of
her
dark
hair
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
tell
me
,
dear
.
<EOS>
do
you
think
I
have
grow
old
-
fashioned
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
sister
laugh
,
and
fondle
him
,
and
tell
him
"
no
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
because
I
know
they
say
so
,
"
return
Paul
,
"
and
I
want
to
know
what
they
mean
,
Floy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
a
loud
double
knock
come
at
the
door
,
and

<EOS>
Sir

,
and

the
honour
of

Paul

father
at
a
public
dinner
,
and
that
he

<EOS>
then
Paul
hear

to
Lady

,
"

<EOS>
"
Barnet

"
to
Master

,
who

say
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
,
with
an
emphasis
on
the
permission
.
  
<EOS>
"
what

<EOS>
what

<EOS>
what
a
lovely
face

"
exclaim
Lady
Skettles
softly
,
as
she
look
at
Florence
through
her
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
sister
,
"
say
Paul
,
present
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
satisfaction
of
the
Skettleses
be
now
complete
.
<EOS>
and
as
Lady
Skettles
have
conceive
,
at
first
sight
,
a
liking
for
Paul
,
they
all
go
up
stair
together
:
<EOS>
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
take
care
of
Florence
,
and
young
Barnet
follow
.
  
<EOS>
Young
Barnet
do
not
remain
long
in
the
background
after
they
have
reach
the
drawing
-
room
,
for
Dr
Blimber
have
him
out
in
no
time
,
dance
with
Florence
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
appear
to
Paul
to
be
particularly
happy
,
or
particularly
anything
but
sulky
,
or
to
care
much
what
he
be
about
;
but
as
Paul
hear
Lady
skettle
say
to
Mrs
Blimber
,
while
she
beat
time
with
her
fan
,
that
her
dear
boy
be
evidently
smite
to
death
by
that
angel
of
a
child
,
Miss
Dombey
,
it
would
seem
that
Skettles
Junior
be
in
a
state
of
bliss
,
without
show
it
.
  
<EOS>
Little
Paul
think
it
a
singular
coincidence
that
nobody
have
occupy
his
place
among
the
pillow
;
and
that
when
he
come
into
the
room
again
,
they
should
all
make
way
for
him
to
go
back
to
it
,
remember
it
be
his
.
<EOS>
nobody
stand
before
him
either
,
when
they
observe
that
he
like
to
see
Florence
dance
,
but
they
leave
the
space
in
front
quite
clear
,
so
that
he
may
follow
her
with
his
eye
.
<EOS>
They
be
so
kind
too
,
even
the
stranger
,
of
whom
there
be
soon
a
great
many
,
that
they
come
and
speak
to
him
every
now
and
then
,
and
ask
him
how
he
be
,
and
if
his
head
ache
,
and
whether
he
be
tired
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
much
oblige
to
them
for
all
their
kindness
and
attention
,
and
recline
prop
up
in
his
corner
,
with
Mrs
Blimber
and
Lady
Skettles
on
the
same
sofa
,
and
Florence
come
and
sit
by
his
side
as
soon
as
every
dance
be
end
,
he
look
on
very
happily
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
would
have
sit
by
him
all
night
,
and
would
not
have
dance
at
all
of
her
own
accord
,
but
Paul
make
her
,
by
tell
her
how
much
it
please
him
.
<EOS>
and
he
tell
her
the
truth
,
too
;
for
his
small
heart
swell
,
and
his
face
glow
,
when
he
see
how
much
they
all
admire
her
,
and
how
she
be
the
beautiful
little
rosebud
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
from
his
nest
among
the
pillow
,
Paul
could
see
and
hear
almost
everything
that
pass
,
as
if
the
whole
be
be
do
for
his
amusement
.
<EOS>
among
other
little
incident
that
the
observe
,
he
observe
Mr
Baps
the
dancing
-
master
get
into
conversation
with
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
,
and
very
soon
ask
him
,
as
he
have
ask
Mr
Toots
,
what
you
be
to
do
with
your
raw
material
,
when
they
come
into
your
port
in
return
for
your
drain
of
gold
---
which
be
such
a
mystery
to
Paul
that
he
be
quite
desirous
to
know
what
ought
to
be
do
with
them
.
<EOS>
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
have
much
to
say
upon
the
question
,
and
say
it
;
but
it
do
not
appear
to
solve
the
question
,
for
Mr
Baps
retort
,
yes
,
but
suppose
Russia
step
in
with
her
tallow
;
which
strike
Sir
Barnet
almost
dumb
,
for
he
could
only
shake
his
head
after
that
,
and
say
,
why
then
you
must
fall
back
upon
your
cotton
,
he
suppose
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
look
after
Mr
Baps
when
he
go
to
cheer
up
Mrs
Baps
<EOS>
(
who
,
be
quite
desert
,
be
pretend
to
look
over
the
music
-
book
of
the
gentleman
who
play
the
harp
)
,
as
if
he
think
him
a
remarkable
kind
of
man
;
and
shortly
afterwards
he
say
so
in
those
word
to
Doctor
Blimber
,
and
inquire
if
he
may
take
the
liberty
of
ask
who
he
be
,
and
whether
he
have
ever
be
in
the
Board
of
Trade
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Blimber
answer
no
,
he
believe
not
;
and
that
in
fact
he
be
a
Professor
of
---
   
"
of
something

with
statistic
,
I
will
swear
?
"
<EOS>
observe
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
no
,
Sir
Barnet
,
"
reply
Doctor
Blimber
,
rub
his
chin
.
<EOS>
no
,
not
exactly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
figure
of
some
sort
,
I
would
venture
a
bet
,
"
say
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
yes
,
"
say
Doctor
Blimber
,
"
"
<EOS>
yes
,
but
not
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
Mr
Baps
be
a
very
worthy
sort
of
man
,
Sir
Barnet
,
and
<EOS>
---
in
fact
he
be
our
professor
of
dancing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Paul
be
amazed
to
see
that
this
piece
of
information
quite
alter
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
'
opinion
of
Mr
Baps
,
and
that
Sir
Barnet
fly
into
a
perfect
rage
,
and
glower
at
Mr
Baps
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
even
go
so
far
as
to
D
Mr
Baps
to
Lady
Skettles
,
in
tell
her
what
have
happen
,
and
to
say
that
it
be
like
his
most
con
-
sum
-
mate
and
confoun
-
de
impudence
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
another
thing
that
Paul
observe
.
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
,
after
imbibe
several
custard
-
cup
of
negus
,
begin
to
enjoy
himself
.
<EOS>
the
dancing
in
general
be
ceremonious
,
and
the
music
rather
solemn
---
a
little
like
church
music
in
fact
---
but
after
the
custard
---
cup
,
Mr
Feeder
tell
Mr
Toots
that
he
be
go
to
throw
a
little
spirit
into
the
thing
.
<EOS>
after
that
,
Mr
Feeder
not
only
begin
to
dance
as
if
he
mean
dance
and
nothing
else
,
but
secretly
to
stimulate
the
music
to
perform
wild
tune
.
<EOS>
further
,
he
become
particular
in
his
attention
to
the
lady
;
and
dance
with
Miss
Blimber
,
whisper
to
her
---
whisper
to
her
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
though
not
so
softly
<EOS>
but
that
Paul
hear
him
say
<EOS>
this
remarkable
poetry
,
  
"
have
I
a
heart
for
falsehood
frame
,
I
ne'er
could
injure
You
!
"
  
<EOS>
this
Paul
hear
him
repeat
to
young
lady
in
succession
.
<EOS>
well
may
Mr
Feeder
say
to
Mr
Toots
,
that
he
be
afraid
he
should
be
the
bad
for
it
to
-
morrow
!
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Blimber
be
a
little
alarm
by
this
---
comparatively
speak
---
profligate
behaviour
;
and
especially
by
the
alteration
in
the
character
of
the
music
,
which
,
begin
to
comprehend
low
melody
that
be
popular
in
the
street
,
may
not
unnaturally
be
suppose
to
give
offence
to
Lady
Skettles
.
<EOS>
but
Lady
Skettles
be
so
very
kind
as
to
beg
Mrs
Blimber
not
to
mention
it
;
and
to
receive
her
explanation
that
Mr
Feeder
's
spirit
sometimes
betray
him
into
excess
on
these
occasion
,
with
the
great
courtesy
and
politeness
;
observe
,
that
he
seem
a
very
nice
sort
of
person
for
his
situation
,
and
that
she
particularly
like
the
unassume
style
of
his
hair
---
which
(
as
already
hint
)
be
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
long
.
  
<EOS>
once
,
when
there
be
a
pause
in
the
dancing
,
Lady
Skettles
tell
Paul
that
he
seem
very
fond
of
music
.
<EOS>
Paul
reply
,
that
he
be
;
and
if
she
be
too
,
she
ought
to
hear
his
sister
,
Florence
,
sing
.
<EOS>
Lady
Skettles
presently
discover
that
she
be
die
with
anxiety
to
have
that
gratification
;
and
though
Florence
be
at
first
very
much
frightened
at
be
ask
to
sing
before
so
many
people
,
and
beg
earnestly
to
be
excuse
,
yet
,
on
Paul
call
her
to
him
,
and
say
,
"
do
,
floy!please
!
<EOS>
for
me
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
go
straight
to
the
piano
,
and
begin
.
<EOS>
when
they
all
draw
a
little
away
,
that
Paul
may
see
her
;
and
when
he
see
her
sit
there
all
alone
,
so
young
,
and
good
,
and
beautiful
,
and
kind
to
him
;
and
hear
her
thrilling
voice
,
so
natural
and
sweet
,
and
such
a
golden
link
between
him
and
all
his
life
's
love
and
happiness
,
rise
out
of
the
silence
;
he
turn
his
face
away
,
and
hide
his
tear
.
<EOS>
not
,
as
he
tell
them
when
they
speak
to
him
,
not
that
the
music
be
too
plaintive
or
too
sorrowful
,
but
it
be
so
dear
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
They
all
love
Florence
!
<EOS>
how
could
they
help
it
!
<EOS>
Paul
have
know
beforehand
that
they
must
and
would
;
and
sit
in
his
cushion
corner
,
with
calmly
fold
hand
,
and
one
leg
loosely
double
under
him
,
few
would
have
think
what
triumph
and
delight
expand
his
childish
bosom
while
he
watch
her
,
or
what
a
sweet
tranquillity
he
feel
.
<EOS>
lavish
encomium
on
"
Dombey
's
sister
"
reach
his
ear
from
all
the
boy
:
admiration
of
the
self
-
possess
and
modest
little
beauty
be
on
every
lip
:
report
of
her
intelligence
and
accomplishment
float
past
him
,
constantly
;
and
,
as
if
borne
in
upon
the
air
of
the
summer
night
,
there
be
a
half
-
intelligible
sentiment
diffuse
around
,
refer
to
Florence
and
himself
,
and
breathe
sympathy
for
both
,
that
soothe
and
touch
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
why
.
<EOS>
for
all
that
the
child
observe
,
and
feel
,
and
think
,
that
night
---
the
present
and
the
absent
;
what
be
then
and
what
have
be
---
be
blend
like
the
colour
in
the
rainbow
,
or
in
the
plumage
of
rich
bird
when
the
sun
be
shine
on
them
,
or
in
the
soften
sky
when
the
same
sun
be
set
.
<EOS>
the
many
thing
he
have
have
to
think
of
lately
,
pass
before
him
in
the
music
;
not
as
claim
his
attention
over
again
,
or
as
likely
evermore
to
occupy
it
,
but
as
peacefully
dispose
of
and
go
.
<EOS>
a
solitary
window
,
gaze
through
year
ago
,
look
out
upon
an
ocean
,
mile
and
mile
away
;
upon
its
water
,
fancy
,
busy
with
him
only
yesterday
,
be
hush
and
lull
to
rest
like
break
wave
.
<EOS>
the
same
mysterious
murmur
he
have
wonder
at
,
when
lie
on
his
couch
upon
the
beach
,
he
think
he
still
hear
sound
through
his
sister
's
song
,
and
through
the
hum
of
voice
,
and
the
tread
of
foot
,
and
have
some
part
in
the
face
flit
by
,
and
even
in
the
heavy
gentleness
of
Mr
Toots
,
who
frequently
come
up
to
shake
him
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
through
the
universal
kindness
he
still
think
he
hear
it
,
speak
to
him
;
and
even
his
oldfashioned
reputation
seem
to
be
ally
to
it
,
he
know
not
how
.
<EOS>
thus
little
Paul
sit
muse
,
listen
,
look
on
,
and
dream
;
and
be
very
happy
.
  
<EOS>
until
the
time
arrive
for
take
leave
:
<EOS>
and
then
,
indeed
,
there
be
a
sensation
in
the
party
.
<EOS>
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
bring
up
Skettles
Junior
to
shake
hand
with
him
,
and
ask
him
if
he
would
remember
to
tell
his
good
papa
,
with
his
good
compliment
,
that
he
,
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
,
have
say
he
hope
the
two
young
gentleman
would
become
intimately
acquaint
.
<EOS>
Lady
Skettles
kiss
him
,
and
part
his
hair
upon
his
brow
,
and
hold
him
in
her
arm
;
and
even
Mrs
Baps
---
poor
Mrs
Baps
!
<EOS>
Paul
be
glad
of
that
---
come
over
from

I

Paul

bade
adieu
to
Mrs

such
heartfelt

Cicero

God
bless
you

<EOS>
and
it
show
,
Paul
think
,
how
easily
one
may
do
injustice
to
a
person
;
for
Miss

mean
it
---
though
she
be
a
Forcer

a

,
of
"
Dombey

go

"
<EOS>
"
Little
Dombey
's
go
!
"
<EOS>
and
there
be
a
general
move
after
Paul
and
Florence
down
the
staircase
and
into
the
hall
,
in
which
the
whole
Blimber
family
be
include
.
<EOS>
such
a
circumstance
<EOS>
,
Mr
Feeder
say
aloud
,
as
have
never
happen
in
the
case
of
any
former
young
gentleman
within
his
experience
;
but
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
if
this
be
sober
fact
or
custard

cup

<EOS>
the
servant
,
with
the
butler
at
their
head
,
have
all
an
interest
in
see
Little
Dombey
go
;
and
even
the
weak

eyed
young
man
,
take
out
his
book
and
trunk
to
the
coach
that
be
to
carry
him
and
Florence
to
Mrs
Pipchin
's
for
the
night
,
melt
visibly
.
  
<EOS>
not
even
the
influence
of
the
soft
passion
on
the
young
gentleman
---
and
they
all
,
to
a
boy
,
doate
on
Florence
---
could
restrain
them
from
take
quite
a
noisy
leave
of
Paul
;
wave
hat
after
him
,
press
downstairs
to
shake
hand
with
him
,
cry
individually
"
Dombey
,
do
not
forget
me
!
"
<EOS>
and
indulge
in
many
such
ebullition
of
feeling
,
uncommon
among
those
young
Chesterfields
.
<EOS>
Paul
whisper
Florence
,
as
she
wrap
him
up
before
the
door
be
open
,
do
she
hear
them
?
<EOS>
Would
she
ever
forget
it
?
<EOS>
be
she
glad
to
know
it
?
<EOS>
and
a
lively
delight
be
in
his
eye
as
he
speak
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
once
,
for
a
last
look
,
he
turn
and
gaze
upon
the
face
thus
address
to
him
,
surprised
to
see
how
shine
and
how
bright
,
and
numerous
they
be
,
and
how
they
be
all
pile
and
heap
up
,
as
face
be
at
crowded
theatre
.
<EOS>
They
swam
before
him
as
he
look
,
like
face
in
an
agitated
glass
;
and
next
moment
he
be
in
the
dark
coach
outside
,
hold
close
to
Florence
.
<EOS>
from
that
time
,
whenever
he
think
of
Doctor
Blimber
's
,
it
come
back
as
he
have
see
it
in
this
last
view
;
and
it
never
seem
to
be
a
real
place
again
,
but
always
a
dream
,
full
of
eye
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
not
quite
the
last
of
Doctor
Blimber
's
,
however
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
else
.
<EOS>
there
be
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
who
,
unexpectedly
let
down
one
of
the
coach
-
window
,
and
look
in
,
say
,
with
a
most
egregious
chuckle
,
"
be
Dombey
there
?
"
and
immediately
put
it
up
again
,
without
wait
for
an
answer
.
<EOS>
nor
be
this
quite
the
last
of
Mr
Toots
,
even
;
for
before
the
coachman
could
drive
off
,
he
as
suddenly
let
down
the
other
window
,
and
look
in
with
a
precisely
similar
chuckle
,
say
in
a
precisely
similar
tone
of
voice
,
"
be
Dombey
there
?
"
and
disappear
precisely
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
how
Florence
laugh
!
<EOS>
Paul
often
remember
it
,
and
laugh
himself
whenever
he
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
much
,
soon
afterwards
---
next
day
,
and
after
that
---
which
Paul
could
only
recollect
confusedly
.
<EOS>
as
,
why
they
stay
at
Mrs
Pipchin
's
day
and
night
,
instead
of
go
home
;
why
he
lie
in
bed
,
with
Florence
sit
by
his
side
;
whether
that
have
be
his
father
in
the
room
,
or
only
a
tall
shadow
on
the
wall
;
whether
he
have
hear
his
doctor
say
,
of
some
one
,
that
if
they
have
remove
him
before
the
occasion
on
which
he
have
build
up
fancy
,
strong
in
proportion
to
his
own
weakness
,
it
be
very
possible
he
may
have
pine
away
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
not
even
remember
whether
he
have
often
say
to
Florence
,
"
oh
Floy
,
take
me
home
,
and
never
leave
me
!
"
<EOS>
but
he
think
he
have
.
<EOS>
He
fancy
sometimes
he
have
hear
himself
repeat
,
"
take
me
home
,
Floy
!
<EOS>
take
me
home
!
"
  
<EOS>
but
he
could
remember
,
when
he
get
home
,
and
be
carry
up
the
well
-
remember
stair
,
that
there
have
be
the
rumbling
of
a
coach
for
many
hour
together
,
while
he
lie
upon
the
seat
,
with
Florence
still
beside
him
,
and
old
Mrs
Pipchin
sit
opposite
.
<EOS>
He
remember
his
old
bed
too
,
when
they
lay
him
down
in
it
:
his
aunt
,
Miss
Tox
,
and
Susan
:
but
there
be
something
else
,
and
recent
too
,
that
still
perplex
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
to
Florence
,
if
you
please
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
to
Florence
by
herself
,
for
a
moment
!
"
  
She
bend
down
over
him
,
and
the
other
stand
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Floy
,
my
pet
,
be
not
that
Papa
in
the
hall
,
when
they
bring
me
from
the
coach
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

"
  
"
He
do
not
cry
,
and
go
into
his
room
,
Floy
,
do
he
,
when
he
see
me
come
in

"
  
<EOS>
Florence
shake
her
head
,
and
press
her
lip
against
his
cheek
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
he
do
not
cry
,
"
say
little
Paul
.
<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
Amazing
Artfulness
of
Captain
Cuttle
,
and
a
new
Pursuit
for
Walter
Gay
 
<EOS>
WALTER
could
not
,
for
several
day
,
decide
what
to
do
in
the
Barbados
business
;
and
even
cherish
some
faint
hope
that
Mr
Dombey
may
not
have
mean
what
he
have
say
,
or
that
he
may
change
his
mind
,
and
tell
him
he
be
not
to
go
.
<EOS>
but
as
nothing
occur
to
give
this
idea
(
which
be
sufficiently
improbable
in
itself
)
any
touch
of
confirmation
,
and
as
time
be
slip
by
,
and
he
have
none
to
lose
,
he
feel
that
he
must
act
,
without
hesitate
any
longer
.
  
<EOS>
Walter
's
chief
difficulty
be
,
how
to
break
the
change
in
his
affair
to
Uncle
Sol
,
to
whom
he
be
sensible
it
would
be
a
terrible
blow
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
great
difficulty
in
dash
Uncle
Sol
's
spirit
with
such
an
astounding
piece
of
intelligence
,
because
they
have
lately
recover
very
much
,
and
the
old
man
have
become
so
cheerful
,
that
the
little
back
parlour
be
itself
again
.
<EOS>
Uncle
Sol
have
pay
the
first
appoint
portion
of
the
debt
to
Mr
Dombey
,
and
be
hopeful
of
work
his
way
through
the
rest
;
and
to
cast
him
down
afresh
,
when
he
have
spring
up
so
manfully
from
his
trouble
,
be
a
very
distressing
necessity
.
  
<EOS>
yet
it
would
never
do
to
run
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
must
know
of
it
beforehand
:
and
how
to
tell
him
be
the
point
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
question
of
go
or
not
go
,
Walter
do
not
consider
that
he
have
any
power
of
choice
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
have
truly
tell
him
that
he
be
young
,
and
that
his
uncle
's
circumstance
be
not
good
;
and
Mr
Dombey
have
plainly
express
,
in
the
glance
with
which
he
have
accompany
that
reminder
,
that
if
he
decline
to
go
he
may
stay
at
home
if
he
choose
,
but
not
in
his
counting
-
house
.
<EOS>
His
uncle
and
he
lie
under
a
great
obligation
to
Mr
Dombey
,
which
be
of
Walter
's
own
soliciting
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
begin
in
secret
to
despair
of
ever
win
that
gentleman
's
favour
,
and
may
have
think
that
he
be
now
and
then
dispose
to
put
a
slight
upon
him
,
which
be
hardly
just
.
<EOS>
but
what
would
have
be
duty
without
that
,
be
still
duty
with
it
---
or
Walter
think
so
---
and
duty
must
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mr
Dombey
have
look
at
him
,
and
tell
him
he
be
young
,
and
that
his
uncle
's
circumstance
be
not
good
,
there
have
be
an
expression
of
disdain
in
his
face
;
a
contemptuous
and
disparage
assumption
that
he
would
be
quite
content
to
live
idly
on
a
reduce
old
man
,
which
sting
the
boy
's
generous
soul
.
<EOS>
determine
to
assure
Mr
Dombey
,
in
so
far
as
it
be
possible
to
give
him
the
assurance
without
express
it
in
word
,
that
indeed
he
mistake
his
nature
,
Walter
have
be
anxious
to
show
even
more
cheerfulness
and
activity
after
the
west
indian
interview
than
he
have
show
before
:
if
that
be
possible
,
in
one
of
his
quick
and
zealous
disposition
.
<EOS>
He
be
too
young
and
inexperienced
to
think
,
that
possibly
this
very
quality
in
him
be
not
agreeable
to
Mr
Dombey
,
and
that
it
be
no
step
-
stone
to
his
good
opinion
to
be
elastic
and
hopeful
of
pleasing
under
the
shadow
of
his
powerful
displeasure
,
whether
it
be
right
or
wrong
.
<EOS>
but
it
may
have
be
---
it
may
have
be
---
that
the
great
man
think
himself
defy
in
this
new
exposition
of
an
honest
spirit
,
and
purpose
to
bring
it
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
!
at
last
and
at
least
,
Uncle
Sol
must
be
tell
,
"
think
Walter
,
with
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
and
as
Walter
be
apprehensive
that
his
voice
may
perhaps
quaver
a
little
,
and
that
his
countenance
may
not
be
quite
as
hopeful
as
he
could
wish
it
to
be
,
if
he
tell
the
old
man
himself
,
and
see
the
first
effect
of
his
communication
on
his
wrinkle
face
,
he
resolve
to
avail
himself
of
the
service
of
that
powerful
mediator
,
Captain
Cuttle
.
<EOS>
Sunday
come
round
,
he
set
off
therefore
,
after
breakfast
,
once
more
to
beat
up
Captain
Cuttle
's
quarter
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
unpleasant
to
remember
,
on
the
way
thither
,
that
Mrs
MacStinger
resort
to
a
great
distance
every
Sunday
morning
,
to
attend
the
ministry
of
the
Reverend
Melchisedech
Howler
,
who
,
have
be
one
day
discharge
from
the
West
India
Docks
on
a
false
suspicion
<EOS>
(
get
up
expressly
against
him
by
the
general
enemy
)
of
screw
gimlet
into
puncheon
,
and
apply
his
lip
to
the
orifice
,
have
announce
the
destruction
of
the
world
for
that
day
two
year
,
at
ten
in
the
morning
,
and
open
a
front
parlour
for
the
reception
of
lady
and
gentleman
of
the
rant
persuasion
,
upon
whom
,
on
the
first
occasion
of
their
assemblage
,
the
admonition
of
the
Reverend
Melchisedech
have
produce
so
powerful
an
effect
,
that
,
in
their
rapturous
performance
of
a
sacred
jig
,
which
close
the
service
,
the
whole
flock
break
through
into
a
kitchen
below
,
and
disable
a
mangle
belong
to
one
of
the
fold
.
  
<EOS>
this
the
Captain
,
in
a
moment
of
uncommon
conviviality
,
have
confide
to
Walter
and
his
uncle
,
between
the
repetition
of
lovely
Peg
,
on
the
night
when
Brogley
the
broker
be
pay
out
.
<EOS>
the
Captain
himself
be
punctual
in
his
attendance
at
a
church
in
his
own
neighbourhood
,
which
hoist
the
Union
Jack
every
Sunday
morning
;
and
where
he
be
good
enough
---
the
lawful
beadle
be
infirm
---
to
keep
an
eye
upon
the
boy
,
over
whom
he
exercise
great
power
,
in
virtue
of
his
mysterious
hook
.
<EOS>
know
the
regularity
of
the
Captain
's
habit
,
Walter
make
all
the
haste
he
could
,
that
he
may
anticipate
his
go
out
;
and
he
make
such
good
speed
,
that
he
have
the
pleasure
,
on
turn
into
Brig
Place
,
to
behold
the
broad
blue
coat
and
waistcoat
hang
out
of
the
Captain
's
open
window
,
to
air
in
the
sun
.
  
<EOS>
It
appear
incredible
that
the
coat
and
waistcoat
could
be
see
by
mortal
eye
without
the
captain
:
but
he
certainly
be
not
in
them
,
<EOS>
otherwise
his
leg
---
the
house
in
Brig
Place
not
be
lofty
---
would
have
obstruct
the
street
door
,
which
be
perfectly
clear
.
<EOS>
quite
wonder
at
this
discovery
,
Walter
give
a
single
knock
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stinger
,
"
he
distinctly
hear
the
Captain
say
,
up
in
his
room
,
as
if
that
be
no
business
of
his
.
<EOS>
therefore
Walter
give
two
knock
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cuttle
,
"
he
hear
the
Captain
say
upon
that
;
and
immediately
afterwards
the
Captain
,
in
his
clean
shirt
and
brace
,
with
his
neckerchief
hang
loosely
round
his
throat
like
a
coil
of
rope
,
and
his
glaze
hat
on
,
appear
at
the
window
,
lean
out
over
the
broad
blue
coat
and
waistcoat
.
  
<EOS>
"
wal'r

cry
the
Captain
,
look
down
upon
him
in
amazement

Walter
relate
to
him
what
have
happen
;

the
difficulty
in
which
he
feel
respect
his

the
relief
it
would
be
to
him
if
Captain
Cuttle
,
in
his
kindness
,
would
help
him
to
smooth
it
away
;
Captain
Cuttle
's
infinite
consternation

astonishment
at
the
prospect
unfold
to
him
,
gradually
swallow
that
gentleman
up
,
until
it
leave
his
face
quite
vacant
,
and
the
suit
of
blue
,
the
glaze
hat
,

the
hook
,
apparently
without

You

Walter

for
myself

I
be
to

my

I
know

there
be
two
point
I
be
think

as
I
come
along

that
I
should
by
very
particular
about

I
do
not

<EOS>
the
Captain
seem
to
make
an
endeavour
to
rise
from
the
depth
of
his
astonishment

get
back
to
his
face

but
the
effort
be
ineffectual

the
glaze
hat
merely
nod
with
a
mute

unutterable
meaning

Walter

his

I

right

"
  
<EOS>
"
well
then
,
"
say
Walter

try
to
speak
gaily
,
"
we
must
do
our
good
to
make
him
believe
that

a
temporary
one

after
all

but
as
I
know
better
,

dread
that
I

Captain

as
I
have
so
many
reason
for

affection

duty

honour

I
be
afraid
I
should
make

<EOS>
a
very
poor
hand
at
that
,
if
I
try

persuade
him
of
it

<EOS>
that
be
my
great
reason
for

you
to
break
it
out

that

the
first
point

<EOS>

off

so

Walter
pause
to
ascertain
if
the

have
any
particular
information
to
add
to
this
,

as
he

no
more
,
go
on

<EOS>
"
now
,
the
second
point
,
Captain
Cuttle
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
say
,
I
be
not
a
favourite
with
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
try
to
do
my
good
,
and
I
have
always
do
it
;
but
he
do
not
like
me
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
help
his
liking
and
disliking
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
only
say
that
I
be
certain
he
do
not
like
me
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
send
me
to
this
post
as
a
good
one
;
he
disdain
to
represent
it
as
be
well
than
it
be
;
and
I
doubt
very
much
if
it
will
ever
lead
me
to
advancement
in
the
House
---
whether
it
do
not
,
on
the
contrary
,
dispose
of
me
for
ever
,
and
put
me
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
now
,
we
must
say
nothing
of
this
to
my
uncle
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
but
must
make
it
out
to
be
as
favourable
and
promising
as
we
can
;
and
when
I
tell
you
what
it
really
be
<EOS>
,
I
only
do
so
,
that
in
case
any
mean
should
ever
arise
of
lend
me
a
hand
,
so
far
off
,
I
may
have
one
friend
at
home

know
my
real
situation

what

that

scarcely
appear
to
relish
the
commission
,

to
be
by
any
mean
confident
of
his
power
of
execute
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
arrange
the
future
life
and
adventure
of
Walter
so
very
differently
,
and
so
entirely
to
his
own
satisfaction
;
he
have
felicitate
himself
so
often
on
the
sagacity
and
foresight
display
in
that
arrangement
,
and
have
find
it
so
complete
and
perfect
in
all
its
part
;
that
to
suffer
it
to
go
to
piece
all
at
once
,
and
even
to
assist
in
break
it
up
,
require
a
great
effort
of
his
resolution
.
<EOS>
the
Captain
,
too
,
find
it
difficult
to
unload
his
old
idea
upon
the
subject
,
and
to
take
a
perfectly
new
cargo
on
board
,
with
that
rapidity
which
the
circumstance
require
,
or
without
jumble
and
confound
the
two
.
<EOS>
consequently
,
instead
of
put
on
his
coat
and
waistcoat
with
anything
like
the
impetuosity
that
could
alone
have
keep
pace
with
Walter
's
mood
,
he
decline
to
invest
himself
with
those
garment
at
all
at
present
;
and
inform
Walter
that
on
such
a
serious
matter
,
he
must
be
allow
to
"
bite
his
nail
a
bit

you
may
know
that
Ned
Cuttle

aground

"
  
<EOS>
thereupon
the
Captain
put
his
iron
hook
between
his
tooth
,
as
if
it
be
a
hand
;
and
with
an
air
of
wisdom

profundity
that

the
very
concentration

sublimation
of

philosophical
reflection

grave
inquiry

devoutly

exact
idea

the

attach
to
this

piece
of
praise

he
do
not
further
elucidate

neither
do
Walter

it
forth

on
his

the
vivacity
natural

profound
state
of

that

eye
him
steadfastly
from
beneath
his
bushy
eyebrow
,
he
evidently
neither
see
not
hear
him
,
but
remain
immersed
in
cogitation
.
  
<EOS>
in
fact
,
Captain
Cuttle
be
labour
with
such
great
design
,
that
far
from
be
aground
,
he
soon
get
off
into
the
deep
of
water
,
and
could
find
no
bottom
to
his
penetration
.
<EOS>
by
degree
it
become
perfectly
plain
to
the
Captain
that
there
be
some
mistake
here
;
that
it
be
undoubtedly
much
more
likely
to
be
Walter
's
mistake
than
his
;
that
if
there
be
really
any
West
India
scheme
afoot
,
it
be
a
very
different
one
from
what
Walter
,
who
be
young
and
rash
,
suppose
;
and
could
only
be
some
new
device
for
make
his
fortune
with
unusual
celerity
.
<EOS>
"
or
if
there
should
be
any
little
hitch
between
'
em
,
"
think
the
Captain
,
mean
between
Walter
and
Mr
Dombey
,
"
it
only
want
a
word
in
season
from
a
friend
of
both
party
,
to
set
it
right
and
smooth
,
and
make
all
taut
again
.
"
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
's
deduction
from
these
consideration
be
,
that
as
he
already
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
know
Mr
Dombey
,
from
have
spend
a
very
agreeable
half
-
hour
in
his
company
at
Brighton
(
on
the
morning
when
they
borrow
the
money
)
;
and
that
,
as
a
couple
of
man
of
the
world
,
who
understand
each
other
,
and
be
mutually
disposed
to
make
thing
comfortable
,
could
easily
arrange
any
little
difficulty
of
this
sort
,
and
come
at
the
real
fact
;
the
friendly
thing
for
him
to
do
would
be
,
without
save
anything
about
it
to
Walter
at
present
,
just
to
step
up
to
Mr
Dombey
's
house
---
say
to
the
servant
"
Would
ye
be
so
good
,
<EOS>
my
lad
,
as
report
Cap'en
Cuttle
here
?
<EOS>
"
---
meet
Mr
Dombey
in
a
confidential
spirit
---
hook
him
by
the
button
-
hole
---
talk
it
over
---
make
it
all
right
---
and
come
away
triumphant
!
  
<EOS>
as
these
reflection
present
themselves
to
the
Captain
's
mind
,
and
by
slow
degree
assume
this
shape
and
form
,
his
visage
clear
like
a
doubtful
morning
when
it
give
place
to
a
bright
noon
.
<EOS>
His
eyebrow
,
which
have
be
in
the
high
degree
portentous
,
smooth
their
rugged
bristling
aspect
,
and
become
serene
;
his
eye
,
which
have
be
nearly
close
in
the
severity
of
his
mental
exercise
,
open
freely
;
a
smile
which
have
be
at
first
but
three
speck
---
one
at
the
right
-
hand
corner
of
his
mouth
,
and
one
at
the
corner
of
each
eye
---
gradually
overspread
his
whole
face
,
and
ripple
up
into
his
forehead
,
lift
the
glazed
hat
:
as
if
that
too
have
be
aground
with
Captain
Cuttle
,
and
be
now
,
like
him
,
happily
afloat
again
.
  
<EOS>
finally
the
Captain
leave
off
bite
his
nail
,
and
say
,
"
now
,
Wal'r
,
my
boy
,
you
may
help
me
on
with
them
slop
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
by
which
the
Captain
mean
his
coat
and
waistcoat
.
  
<EOS>
Walter
little
imagine
why
the
Captain
be
so
particular
in
the
arrangement
of
his
cravat
,
as
to
twist
the
pendent
end
into
a
sort
of
pigtail
,
and
pass
them
through
a
massive
gold
ring
with
a
picture
of
a
tomb
upon
it
,
and
a
neat
iron
railing
,
and
a
tree
,
in
memory
of
some
deceased
friend
.
<EOS>
nor
why
the
captain
pull
up
his
shirt
-
collar
to
the
utmost
limit
allow
by
the
irish
linen
below
,
and
by
so
do
decorate
himself
with
a
complete
pair
of
blinker
;
nor
why
he
change
his
shoe
,
and
put
on
an
unparalleled
pair
of
ankle
-
jack
,
which
he
only
wear
on
extraordinary
occasion
.
<EOS>
the
Captain
be
at
length
attire
to
his
own
complete
satisfaction
,
and
have
glance
at
himself
from
head
to
foot
in
a
shaving
-
glass
which
he
remove
from
a
nail
for
that
purpose
,
take
up
his
knotted
stick
,
and
say
he
be
ready
.
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
's
walk
be
more
complacent
than
usual
when
they
get
out
into
the
street
;
but
this
Walter
suppose
to
be
the
effect
of
the
ankle
-
jack
,
and
take
little
heed
of
.
<EOS>
before
they
have
go
very
far
,
they
encounter
a
woman
sell
flower
;
when
the
Captain
stop
short
,
as
if
strike
by
a
happy
idea
,
make
a
purchase
of
a
large
bundle
in
her
basket
:
a
most
glorious
nosegay
,
fan
-
shape
,
some
two
foot
and
a
half
round
,
and
compose
of
all
the
jolliest
-
look
flower
that
blow
.
  
<EOS>
arm
with
this
little
token
which
he
design
for
Mr
Dombey
,
Captain
Cuttle
walk
on
with
Walter
until
they
reach
the
instrument
-
maker
's
door
,
before
which
they
both
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
go
in
?
"
say
Walter
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
return
the
Captain
,
who
feel
that
Walter
must
be
get
rid
of
before
he
proceed
any
further
,
and
that
he
have
well
time
his
project
visit
somewhat
later
in
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
will
not
forget
anything
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
return
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
upon
my
walk
at
once
,
"
say
Walter
,
"
<EOS>
and
then
I
shall
be
out
of
the
way
,
Captain
Cuttle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
take
a
good
long
'
un
,
my
lad
!
"
reply
the
Captain
,
call
after
him
.
<EOS>
Walter
wave
his
hand
in
assent
,
and
go
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
His
way
be
nowhere
in
particular
;
but
he
think
he
would
go
out
into
the
field
,
where
he
could
reflect
upon
the
unknown
life
before
him
,
and
rest
under
some
tree
,
ponder
quietly
.
<EOS>
He
know
no
well
field
than
those
near
Hampstead
,
and
no
well
mean
of
get
at
them
than
by
pass
Mr
Dombey
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
as
stately
and
as
dark
as
ever
,
when
he
go
by
and
glance
up
at
its
frowning
front
.
<EOS>
the
blind
be
all
pull
down
,
but
the
upper
window
stand
wide
open
,
and
the
pleasant
air
stir
those
curtain
and
wave
them
to
and
fro
,
be
the
only
sign
of
animation
in
the
whole
exterior
.
<EOS>
Walter
walk
softly
as
he
pass
,
and
be
glad
when
he
have
leave
the
house
a
door
or
two
behind
.
  
<EOS>
He
look
back
then
;
with
the
interest
he
have
always
feel
for
the
place
since
the
adventure
of
the
lose
child
,
year
ago
;
and
look
especially
at
those
upper
window
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
thus
engage
,
a
chariot
drive
to
the
door
,
and
a
portly
gentleman
in
black
,
with
a
heavy
watch
-
chain
,
alight
,
and
go
in
.
<EOS>
when
he
afterwards
remember
this
gentleman
and
his
equipage
together
,
Walter
have
no
doubt
he
be
a
physician
;
and
then
he
wonder
who
be
ill
;
but
the
discovery
do
not
occur
to
him
until
he
have
walk
some
distance
,
think
listlessly
of
other
thing
.
   
<EOS>
though
still
,
of
what
the
house
have
suggest
to
him
;
for
Walter
please
himself
with
think
that
perhaps
the
time
may
come
,
when
the
beautiful
child
who
be
his
old
friend
and
have
always
be
so
grateful
to
him
<EOS>
and
so
glad
to
see
him
since
<EOS>
,
may
interest
her
brother
in
his
behalf
and
influence
his
fortune
for
the
well
.
<EOS>
He
like
to
imagine
this
---
more
,
at
that
moment
,
for
the
pleasure
of
imagine
her
continue
remembrance
of
him
,
than
for
any
worldly
profit
he
may
gain
:
but
another
and
more
sober
fancy
whisper
to
him
that
if
he
be
alive
then
,
he
would
be
beyond
the
sea
and
forget
;
she
marry
,
rich
,
proud
,
happy
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
more
reason
why
she
should
remember
him
with
any
interest
in
such
an
altered
state
of
thing
,
than
any
plaything
she
ever
have
.
<EOS>
no
,
not
so
much
.
  
<EOS>
yet
Walter
so
idealise
the
pretty
child
whom
he
have
find
wander
in
the
rough
street
,
and
so
identify
her
with
her
innocent
gratitude
of
that
night
and
the
simplicity
and
truth
of
its
expression
,
that
he
blush
for
himself
as
a
libeller
when
he
argue
that
she
could
ever
grow
proud
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
his
meditation
be
of
that
fantastic
order
that
it
seem
hardly
less
libellous
in
him
to
imagine
her
grow
a
woman
:
to
think
of
her
as
anything
but
the
same
artless
,
gentle
,
win
little
creature
,
that
she
have
be
in
the
day
of
good
Mrs
Brown
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
Walter
find
out
that
to
reason
with
himself
about
Florence
at
all
,
be
to
become
very
unreasonable
indeed
;
and
that
he
could
do
not
well
than
preserve
her
image
in
his
mind
as
something
precious
,
unattainable
,
unchangeable
,
and
indefinite
---
indefinite
in
all
its
power
of
give
him
pleasure
,
and
restrain
him
like
an
angel
's
hand
from
anything
unworthy
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
stroll
in
the
field
that
Walter
take
that
day
,
listen
to
the
bird
,
and
the
Sunday
bell
,
and
the
softened
murmur
of
the
town
---
breathe
sweet
scent
;
glance
sometimes
at
the
dim
horizon
beyond
which
his
voyage
and
his
place
of
destination
lay
;
then
look
round
on
the
green
english
grass
and
the
home
landscape
.
<EOS>
but
he
hardly
once
think
,
even
of
go
away
,
distinctly
;
and
seem
to
put
off
reflection
idly
,
from
hour
to
hour
,
and
from
minute
to
minute
,
while
he
yet
go
on
reflect
all
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
Walter
have
leave
the
field
behind
him
,
and
be
plod
homeward
in
the
same
abstract
mood
,
when
he
hear
a
shout
from
a
man
,
and
then
a
woman
's
voice
call
to
him
loudly
by
name
.
<EOS>
turn
quickly
in
his
surprise
,
he
see
that
a
hackney
-
coach
,
go
in
the
contrary
direction
,
have
stop
at
no
great
distance
;
that
the
coachman
be
look
back
from
his
box
and
make
signal
to
him
with
his
whip
;
and
that
a
young
woman
inside
be
lean
out
of
the
window
,
and
beckon
with
immense
energy
.
<EOS>
run
up
to
this
coach
,
he
find
that
the
young
woman
be
Miss
Nipper
,
and
that
Miss
Nipper
be
in
such
a
flutter
as
to
be
almost
beside
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"

It

they
soon
,
in
their
impatience
,
burst
in
at

come
into

full
of

<EOS>
Susan

cry
,
Polly
shed
tear
to
see
her
,
and
to
hear
what
she
have
say
;
and
all
the
child
gather
round
(
include
number
of
new
baby
)
;
and
Mr
Toodle
,
who
have
just
come
home
from
Birmingham
,
and
be
eat
his
dinner
out
of
a
basin
,
lay
down
his

and
put
on
his

bonnet

shawl
for
her

which
be
hang
up
behind

then
tap
her
on

back
;
and
say
,
with
more
fatherly
feeling
than
eloquence
,
"
Polly!cut
away

"
  
<EOS>
so
they
get
back
to
the
coach
,
long
before
the
coachman
expect
them
;
and
Walter
,
put
Susan
and
Mrs
Richards
inside
,
take
his
seat
on
the
box
himself
that
there
may
be
no
more
mistake
,
and
deposit
them
safely
in
the
hall
of
Mr

house
---
where
,
by
the
bye
,
he
see
a
mighty
nosegay
lying
,
which
remind
him
of
the
one
Captain
Cuttle
have
purchase
in
his
company
that
morning
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
linger
to
know
more
of
the
young
invalid
,
or
wait
any
length
of
time
to
see
if
he
could
render
the
least
service
;
but
,
painfully
sensible
that
such
conduct
would
be
look
upon
by
Mr
Dombey
as
presumptuous
and
forward
,
he
return
slowly
,
sadly
,
anxiously
,
away
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
not
go
five
minute
'
walk
from
the
door
,
when
a
man
come
run
after
him
,
and
beg
him
to
return
.
<EOS>
Walter
retrace
his
step
as
quickly
as
he
could
,
and
enter
the
gloomy
house
with
a
sorrowful
foreboding

Chapter
16
.
<EOS>
what
the
wave
be
always
say
 
PAUL
have
never
rise
from
his
little
bed
.
<EOS>
He
lie
there
,
listen
to
the
noise
in
the
street
,
quite
tranquilly
;
not
care
much
how
the
time
go
,
but
watch
it
and
watch
everything
about
him
with
observe
eye
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
sunbeam
strike
into
his
room
through
the
rustle
blind
,
and
quiver
on
the
opposite
wall
like
golden
water
,
he
know
that
evening
be
come
on
,
and
that
the
sky
be
red
and
beautiful
.
<EOS>
as
the
reflection
die
away
,
and
a
gloom
go
creep
up
the
wall
,
he
watch
it
deepen
,
deepen
,
deepen
,
into
night
.
<EOS>
then
he
think
how
the
long
street
be
dot
with
lamp
,
and
how
the
peaceful
star
be
shine
overhead
.
<EOS>
His
fancy
have
a
strange
tendency
to
wander
to
the
river
,
which
he
know
be
flow
through
the
great
city
;
and
now
he
think
how
black
it
be
,
and
how
deep
it
would
look
,
reflect
the
host
of
star
---
and
more
than
all
,
how
steadily
it
roll
away
to
meet
the
sea
.
  
<EOS>
as
it
grow
later
in
the
night
,
and
footstep
in
the
street
become
so
rare
that
he
could
hear
them
come
,
count
them
as
they
pass
,
and
lose
them
in
the
hollow
distance
,
he
would
lie
and
watch
the
many
-
coloured
ring
about
the
candle
,
and
wait
patiently
for
day
.
<EOS>
His
only
trouble
be
,
the
swift
and
rapid
river
.
<EOS>
He
feel
force
,
sometimes
,
to
try
to
stop
it
---
to
stem
it
with
his
childish
hand
---
or
choke
its
way
with
sand
---
and
when
he
see
it
come
on
,
resistless
,
he
cry
out
!
<EOS>
but
a
word
from
Florence
,
who
be
always
at
his
side
,
restore
him
to
himself
;
and
lean
his
poor
head
upon
her
breast
,
he
tell
Floy
of
his
dream
,
and
smile
.
  
<EOS>
when
day
begin
to
dawn
again
,
he
watch
for
the
sun
;
and
when
its
cheerful
light
begin
to
sparkle
in
the
room
,
he
picture
to
himself
---
picture
!
<EOS>
he
see
---
the
high
church
tower
rise
up
into
the
morning
sky
,
the
town
reviving
,
wake
,
start
into
life
once
more
,
the
river
glistening
as
it
roll
(
but
roll
fast
as
ever
)
,
and
the
country
bright
with
dew
.
<EOS>
familiar
sound
and
cry
come
by
degree
into
the
street
below
;
the
servant
in
the
house
be
rouse
and
busy
;
face
look
in
at
the
door
,
and
voice
ask
his
attendant
softly
how
he
be
.
<EOS>
Paul
always
answer
for
himself
,
"
I
be
well
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
great
deal
better
,
thank
you
!
<EOS>
tell
Papa
so
!
"
  
<EOS>
by
little
and
little
,
he
get
tired
of
the
bustle
of
the
day
,
the
noise
of
carriage
and
cart
,
and
people
pass
and
repasse
;
and
would
fall
asleep
,
or
be
trouble
with
a
restless
and
uneasy
sense
again
---
the
child
could
hardly
tell
whether
this
be
in
his
sleeping
or
his
wake
moment
---
of
that
rush
river
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
will
it
never
stop
,
Floy
?
"
he
would
sometimes
ask
her
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
bear
me
away
,
I
think
!
"
  
<EOS>
but
Floy
could
always
soothe
and
reassure
him
;
and
it
be
his
daily
delight
to
make
her
lay
her
head
down
on
his
pillow
,
and
take
some
rest
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
always
watch
me
,
Floy
.
<EOS>
let
me
watch
you
,
now
!
<EOS>
"
They
would
prop
him
up
with
cushion
in
a
corner
of
his
bed
,
and
there
he
would
recline
the
while
she
lie
beside
him
:
bend
forward
oftentime
to
kiss
her
,
and
whisper
to
those
who
be
near
that
she
be
tired
,
and
how
she
have
sit
up
so
many
night
beside
him
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
the
flush
of
the
day
,
in
its
heat
and
light
,
would
gradually
decline
;
and
again
the
golden
water
would
be
dance
on
the
wall
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
visit
by
as
many
as
three
grave
doctor
---
they
use
to
assemble
downstairs
,
and
come
up
together
---
and
the
room
be
so
quiet
,
and
Paul
be
so
observant
of
them
(
though
he
never
ask
of
anybody
what
they
say
)
,
that
he
even
know
the
difference
in
the
sound
of
their
watch
.
<EOS>
but
his
interest
centre
in
Sir
Parker
Peps
,
who
always
take
his
seat
on
the
side
of
the
bed
.
<EOS>
for
Paul
have
hear
them
say
long
ago
,
that
that
gentleman
have
be
with
his
mama
when
she
clasp
Florence
in
her
arm
,
and
die
.
<EOS>
and
he
could
not
forget
it
,
now
.
<EOS>
He
like
him
for
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
afraid
.
  
<EOS>
the
people
round
him
change
as
unaccountably
as
on
that
first
night
at
Doctor
Blimber
's
---
except
Florence
;
Florence
never
change
---
and
what
have
be
Sir
Parker
Peps
,
be
now
his
father
,
sit
with
his
head
upon
his
hand
.
<EOS>
old
Mrs
Pipchin
doze
in
an
easy
chair
,
often
change
to
Miss
Tox
,
or
his
aunt
;
and
Paul
be
quite
content
to
shut
his
eye
again
,
and
see
what
happen
next
without
emotion
.
<EOS>
but
this
figure
with
its
head
upon
its
hand
return
so
often
,
and
remain
so
long
,
and
sit
so
still
and
solemn
,
never
speak
,
never
be
speak
to
,
and
rarely
lift
up
its
face
,
that
Paul
begin
to
wonder
languidly
,
if
it
be
real
;
and
in
the
night
-
time
see
it
sit
there
,
with
fear
.
  
<EOS>
"
Floy
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
that

"
  
<EOS>
"
where

"
  
<EOS>
"
there

<EOS>
at

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
there

except
Papa

"
  
<EOS>
the
figure
lift
up
its
head
,
and
rise
,
and
come
to
the
beside
,
say
:
"
My
own
boy
!
<EOS>
do
not
you
know
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Paul
look
it
in
the
face
,
and
think
,
be
this
his
father
?
<EOS>
but
the
face
so
altered
to
his
thinking
,
thrill
while
he
gaze
,
as
if
it
be
in
pain
;
and
before
he
could
reach
out
both
his
hand
to
take
it
between
them
,
and
draw
it
towards
him
,
the
figure
turn
away
quickly
from
the
little
bed
,
and
go
out
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
Paul
look
at
Florence
with
a
flutter
heart
,
but
he
know
what
she
be
go
to
say
,
and
stop
her
with
his
face
against
her
lip
.
<EOS>
the
next
time
he
observe
the
figure
sit
at
the
bottom
of
the
bed
,
he
call
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
be
so
sorry
for
me
,
dear
papa
!
<EOS>
indeed
I
be
quite
happy
!
"
  
<EOS>
His
father
come
and
bend
down
to
him
---
which
he
do
quickly
,
and
without
first
pause
by
the
bedside
---
Paul
hold
him
round
the
neck
,
and
repeat
those
word
to
him
several
time
,
and
very
earnestly
;
and
Paul
never
see
him
in
his
room
again
at
any
time
,
whether
it
be
day
or
night
,
but
he
call
out
,
"
do
not
be
so
sorry
for
me
!
<EOS>
indeed
I
be
quite
happy
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
be
the
beginning
of
his
always
say
in
the
morning
that
he
be
a
great
deal
better
,
and
that
they
be
to
tell
his
father
so
.
  
<EOS>
how
many
time
the
golden
water
dance
upon
the
wall
;
how
many
night
the
dark
,
dark
river
roll
towards
the
sea
in
spite
of
him
;
Paul
never
count
,
never
seek
to
know
.
<EOS>
if
their
kindness
,
or
his
sense
of
it
,
could
have
increase
,
they
be
more
kind
,
and
he
more
grateful
every
day
;
but
whether
they
be
many
day
or
few
,
appear
of
little
moment
now
,
to
the
gentle
boy
.
   
<EOS>
one
night
he
have
be
think
of
his
mother
,
and
her
picture
in
the
drawing
-
room
down
stair
,
and
think
she
must
have
love
sweet
Florence
better
than
his
father
do
,
to
have
hold
her
in
her
arm
when
she
feel
that
she
be
die
---
for
even
he
,
her
brother
,
who
have
such
dear
love
for
her
,
could
have
no
great
wish
than
that
.
<EOS>
the
train
of
thought
suggest
to
him
to
inquire
if
he
have
ever
see
his
mother
;
for
he
could
not
remember
whether
they
have
tell
him
,
yes
or
no
,
the
river
run
very
fast
,
and
confuse
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Floy
,
do
I
ever
see
mama
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
darling
,
why
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
I
ever
see
any
kind
face
,
like
mama
's
,
look
at
me
when
I
be
a
baby
,
Floy
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
ask
,
incredulously
,
as
if
he
have
some
vision
of
a
face
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
,
dear
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whose
,
Floy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
old
nurse
's
.
<EOS>
often
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
where
be
my
old
nurse
?
"
say
Paul
.
<EOS>
"
be
she
dead
too
?
<EOS>
Floy
,
be
we
all
dead
,
except
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
hurry
in
the
room
,
for
an
instant
---
long
,
perhaps
;
but
it
seem
no
more
---
then
all
be
still
again
;
and
Florence
,
with
her
face
quite
colourless
,
but
smile
,
hold
his
head
upon
her
arm
.
<EOS>
Her
arm
tremble
very
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
show
me
that
old
nurse
,
Floy
,
if
you
please
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
not
here
,
darle
.
<EOS>
She
shall
come
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
Floy
!
"
  
<EOS>
Paul
close
his
eye
with
those
word
,
and
fall
asleep
.
<EOS>
when
he
awake
,
the
sun
be
high
,
and
the
broad
day
be
clear
and
warm
.
<EOS>
He
lie
a
little
,
look
at
the
window
,
which
be
open
,
and
the
curtain
rustle
in
the
air
,
and
wave
to
and
fro
:
then
he
say
,
"
Floy
,
be
it
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
be
she
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
some
one
seem
to
go
in
quest
of
her
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
Susan
.
<EOS>
Paul
think
he
hear
her
tell
him
when
he
have
close
his
eye
again
,
that
she
would
soon
be
back
;
but
he
do
not
open
them
to
see
.
<EOS>
She
keep
her
word
---
perhaps
she
have
never
be
away
---
but
the
next
thing
that
happen
be
a
noise
of
footstep
on
the
stair
,
and
then
Paul
wake
---
wake
mind
and
body
---
and
sit
upright
in
his
bed
.
<EOS>
He
see
them
now
about
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
grey
mist
before
them
,
as
there
have
be
sometimes
in
the
night
.
<EOS>
He
know
them
every
one
,
and
call
them
by
their
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
who
be
this
?
<EOS>
be
this
my
old
nurse

"
say
the
child
,
regard
with
a
radiant
smile
,
a
figure
come
in
.
  
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
.
<EOS>
no
other
stranger
would
have
shed
those
tear
at
sight
of
him
,
and
call
him
her
dear
boy
,
her
pretty
boy
,
her
own
poor
blight
child
.
<EOS>
no
other
woman
would
have
stoop
down
by
his
bed
,
and
take
up
his
waste
hand
,
and
put
it
to
her
lip
and
breast
,
as
one
who
have
some
right
to
fondle
it
.
<EOS>
no
other
woman
would
have
so
forget
everybody
there
but
him
and
Floy
,
and
be
so
full
of
tenderness
and
pity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Floy

<EOS>
this
be
a

say
Paul
.
<EOS>
"

do
not
go
away

"
  
<EOS>
His
sense
be
all
quicken
,
and
he
hear
a
name
he
know
.
  
<EOS>
"
who

<EOS>
I
should
like

"
  
<EOS>
nobody
reply
directly
;
but
his
father
soon
say
to
Susan
,
"
call
him
back
,
then
:
let
him
come
up
!
"
<EOS>
after
a
short
pause
of
expectation
,
during
which
he
look
with
smile
interest
and
wonder
,
on
his
nurse
,
and
see
that
she
have
not
forget
Floy
,
Walter

<EOS>
His
open
face
and
manner
,
and
his
cheerful
eye
,
have
always
make
him
a
favourite
with
Paul
;
and
when
Paul
see
him
,
he
stretch
out
his
hand
,
and
say

<EOS>
for
an
instant
,
Paul
look
at
her
with
the
wistful
face
with
which
he
have
so
often
gaze
upon
her
in
his
corner
by
the
fire

<EOS>
"

He
feel
his

before
the

part
from
his

the

their

around

the
golden

He

<EOS>
He
do
not

<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
do
a
little
business
for
the
young
People
 
CAPTAIN
CUTTLE
,
in
the
exercise
of
that
surprising
talent
for
deep
-
laid
and
unfathomable
scheming
,
with
which
(
as
be
not
unusual
in
man
of
transparent
simplicity
)
<EOS>
he
sincerely
believe
himself
to
be
endow
by
nature
,
have
go
to
Mr
Dombey
's
house
on
the
eventful
Sunday
,
wink
all
the
way
as
a
vent
for
his
superfluous
sagacity
,
and
have
present
himself
in
the
full
lustre
of
the
ankle
-
jack
before
the
eye
of
Towlinson
.
<EOS>
hear
from
that
individual
,
to
his
great
concern
,
of
the
impending
calamity
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
in
his
delicacy
,
sheer
off
again
confound
;
merely
hand
in
the
nosegay
as
a
small
mark
of
his
solicitude
,
and
leave
his
respectful
compliment
for
the
family
in
general
,
which
he
accompany
with
an
expression
of
his
hope
that
they
would
lay
their
head
well
to
the
wind
under
exist
circumstance
,
and
a
friendly
intimation
that
he
would
"
look
up
again
'
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
's
compliment
be
never
hear
of
any
more
.
<EOS>
the
Captain
's
nosegay
,
after
lie
in
the
hall
all
night
,
be
sweep
into
the
dust
-
bin
next
morning
;
and
the
Captain
's
sly
arrangement
,
involve
in
one
catastrophe
with
great
hope
and
lofty
design
,
be
crush
to
piece
.
<EOS>
so
when
an
avalanche
bear
down
a
mountain
-
forest
,
twig
and
bush
suffer
with
the
tree
,
and
all
perish
together
.
  
<EOS>
when
Walter
return
home
on
the
Sunday
evening
from
his
long
walk
,
and
its
memorable
close
,
he
be
too
much
occupy
at
first
by
the
tiding
he
have
to
give
them
,
and
by
the
emotion
naturally
awaken
in
his
breast
by
the
scene
through
which
he
have
pass
,
to
observe
either
that
his
uncle
be
evidently
unacquainted
with
the
intelligence
the
Captain
have
undertake
to
impart
,
or
that
the
Captain
make
signal
with
his
hook
,
warn
him
to
avoid
the
subject
.
<EOS>
not
that
the
Captain
's
signal
be
calculate
to
have
prove
very
comprehensible
,
however
attentively
observe
;
for
,
like
those
chinese
sage
who
be
say
in
their
conference
to
write
certain
learn
word
in
the
air
that
be
wholly
impossible
of
pronunciation
,
the
Captain
make
such
wave
and
flourish
as
nobody
without
a
previous
knowledge
of
his
mystery
,
would
have
be
at
all
likely
to
understand
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
however
,
become
cognisant
of
what
have
happen
,
relinquish
these
attempt
,
as
he
perceive
the
slend
chance
that
now
exist
of
his
be
able
to
obtain
a
little
easy
chat
with
Mr
Dombey
before
the
period
of
Walter
's
departure
.
<EOS>
but
in
admit
to
himself
,
with
a
disappointed
and
crestfallen
countenance
,
that
Sol
Gills
must
be
tell
,
and
that
Walter
must
go
---
take
the
case
for
the
present
as
he
find
it
,
and
not
have
it
enlighten
or
improve
beforehand
by
the
know
management
of
a
friend
---
the
Captain
still
feel
an
unabated
confidence
that
he
,
Ned
Cuttle
,
be
the
man
for
Mr
Dombey
;
and
that
,
to
set
Walter
's
fortune
quite
square
,
nothing
be
want
but
that
they
two
should
come
together
.
<EOS>
for
the
Captain
never
could
forget
how
well
he
and
Mr
Dombey
have
get
on
at
Brighton
;
with
what
nicety
each
of
them
have
put
in
a
word
when
it
be
want
;
how
exactly
they
have
take
one
another
's
measure
;
nor
how
Ned
Cuttle
have
point
out
that
resource
in
the
first
extremity
,
and
have
bring
the
interview
to
the
desire
termination
.
<EOS>
on
all
these
ground
the
Captain
soothe
himself
with
think
that
though
Ned
Cuttle
be
force
by
the
pressure
of
event
to
"
stand
by
"
almost
useless
for
the
present
,
Ned
would
fetch
up
with
a
wet
sail
in
good
time
,
and
carry
all
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
under
the
influence
of
this
good
-
natured
delusion
,
Captain
Cuttle
even
go
to
far
as
to
revolve
in
his
own
bosom
,
while
he
sit
look
at
Walter
and
listen
with
a
tear
on
his
shirt
-
collar
to
what
he
relate
,
whether
it
may
not
be
at
once
genteel
and
politic
to
give
Mr
Dombey
a
verbal
invitation
,
whenever
they
should
meet
,
to
come
and
cut
his
mutton
in
Brig
Place
on
some
day
of
his
own
naming
,
and
enter
on
the
question
of
his
young
friend
's
prospect
over
a
social
glass
.
<EOS>
but
the
uncertain
temper
of
Mrs
MacStinger
,
and
the
possibility
of
her
set
up
her
rest
in
the
passage
during
such
an
entertainment
,
and
there
deliver
some
homily
of
an
uncomplimentary
nature
,
operate
as
a
check
on
the
Captain
's
hospitable
thought
,
and
render
him
timid
of
give
them
encouragement
.
  
<EOS>
one
fact
be
quite
clear
to
the
Captain
,
as
Walter
,
sit
thoughtfully
over
his
untasted
dinner
,
dwelt
on
all
that
have
happen
;
namely
,
that
however
Walter
's
modesty
may
stand
in
the
way
of
his
perceiving
it
himself
,
he
be
as
one
may
say
,
a
member
of
Mrs
Dombey
's
family
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
,
in
his
own
person
,
connect
with
the
incident
he
so
pathetically
describe
;
he
have
be
by
name
remember
and
commend
in
close
association
with
it
;
and
his
fortune
must
have
a
particular
interest
in
his
employer
's
eye
.
<EOS>
if
the
Captain

good
conclusion
for
the
peace
of
mind
of
the

maker

therefore
he
avail
himself
of
so
favourable
a
movement
for
break
the
West
Indian
Intelligence
to
his
old
friend
,
as
a
piece
of
extraordinary
preferment
;
declare
that
for
his
part
he
would
freely
give
a
hundred
thousand
pound
(
if
he
have
it
)
for
Walter
's
gain
in
the
long
-
run
,
and
that
he
have
no
doubt
such
an
investment
would
yield
a
handsome
premium

but
the
Captain
flash
such
golden
prospect
before

hint
so
mysteriously
at
whittingtonian
consequence
;
lay
such
emphasis
on
what
Walter
have
just
now
tell
them
:
and
appeal
to
it
so
confidently
as
a
corroboration
of
his
prediction
,
and
a
great
advance
towards
the
realisation
of
the
romantic
legend
of
Lovely
Peg

that

bewilder
the

up
the

such
expressive
shaking
of
his

rubbing
of
his
hand
,
that

first
at

at

"
  
as
it
be
a
contest
of
affection
and
self
-
denial
,
Walter
strike
in
with
infinite
effect
,
to
the
Captain
's
relief
;
and
between
them
they
tolerably
reconcile
old
Sol
Gills
,
by
continue
talk
,
to
the
project
;
or
rather
so
confuse
him
,
that
nothing
,
not
even
the
pain
of
separation
,
be
distinctly
clear
to
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
not
much
time
to
balance
the
matter
;
for
on
the
very
next
day
,
Walter
receive
from
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
,
the
necessary
credential
for
his
passage
and
outfit
,
together
with
the
information
that
the
Son
and
Heir
would
say
in
a
fortnight
,
or
within
a
day
or
two
afterwards
at
late
.
<EOS>
in
the
hurry
of
preparation
:
which
Walter
purposely
enhance
as
much
as
possible
:
the
old
man
lose
what
little
self
-
possession
he
ever
have
;
and
so
the
time
of
departure
draw
on
rapidly
.
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
,
who
do
not
fail
to
make
himself
acquaint
with
all
that
pass
,
through
inquiry
of
Walter
from
day
to
day
,
find
the
time
still
tend
on
towards
his
go
away
,
without
any
occasion
offer
itself
,
or
seem
likely
to
offer
itself
,
for
a
well
understanding
of
his
position
.
<EOS>
It
be
after
much
consideration
of
this
fact
,
and
much
ponder
over
such
an
unfortunate
combination
of
circumstance
,
that
a
bright
idea
occur
to
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
suppose
he
make
a
call
on
Mr
Carker
,
and
try
to
find
out
from
him
how
the
land
really
lie
!
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
like
this
idea
very
much
.
<EOS>
It
come
upon
him
in
a
moment
of
inspiration
,
as
he
be
smoke
an
early
pipe
in
Brig
Place
after
breakfast
;
and
it
be
worthy
of
the
tobacco
.
<EOS>
It
would
quiet
his
conscience
,
which
be
an
honest
one
,
and
be
make
a
little
uneasy
by
what
Walter
have
confide
to
him
,
and
what
Sol
Gills
have
say
;
and
it
would
be
a
deep
,
shrewd
act
of
friendship
.
<EOS>
He
would
sound
Mr
Carker
carefully
,
and
say
much
or
little
,
just
as
he
read
that
gentleman
's
character
,
and
discover
that
they
get
on
well
together
or
the
reverse
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
without
the
fear
of
Walter
before
his
eye
(
who
he
know
be
at
home
packing
)
,
Captain
Cuttle
again
assume
his
ankle
-
jack
and
mourn
brooch
,
and
issue
forth
on
this
second
expedition
.
<EOS>
He
purchase
no
propitiatory
nosegay
on
the
present
occasion
,
as
he
be
go
to
a
place
of
business
;
but
he
put
a
small
sunflower
in
his
button
-
hole
to
give
himself
an
agreeable
relish
of
the
country
;
and
with
this
,
and
the
knobby
stick
,
and
the
glaze
hat
,
bear
down
upon
the
office
of
Dombey
and
Son
.
  
<EOS>
after
take
a
glass
of
warm
rum
-
and
-
water
at
a
tavern
close
by
,
to
collect
his
thought
,
the
Captain
make
a
rush
down
the
court
,
lest
its
good
effect
should
evaporate
,
and
appear
suddenly
to
Mr
Perch
.
  
<EOS>
"
Matey

"
say
the
Captain
,
in
persuasive
accent
.
<EOS>
"

Mr

admit
it
;

the
Captain
in
his
ear
;
"

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
would
have
hook
Perch
gently
to
him
,
but
Mr
Perch
elude
the
attempt
;
not
so
much
in
design
,
as
in
start
at
the
sudden
thought
that
such
a
weapon
unexpectedly
exhibit
to
Mrs
Perch
may
,
in
her
then
condition
,
be
destructive
to
that
lady
's
hope
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
just

Cap'en
Cuttle

his
handkerchief
from

crown
of
the

hat

which
he
jam
between
his
knee

without
injury

its
shape

for
nothing

bend
it

rub
his
head
well
all
over

He

arrange
his
hair
with

hook

and
sit

round
the
office
,
contemplate
the
clerk
with
a
serene
respect

equanimity

so
impenetrable

he
be
altogether
so
mysterious

<EOS>
"

to
all
of
them
as
have
happen
a
long
time
ago
;
though
yet
the
child
lie
,
calm
and
beautiful
,
upon
his
little
bed
.
  
<EOS>
after
dark
there
come
some
visitor
---
noiseless
visitor
,
with
shoe
of
feel
---
who
have
be
there
before
;
and
with
them
come
that
bed
of
rest
which
be
so
strange
a
one
for
infant
sleeper
.
<EOS>
all
this
time
,
the
bereave
father
have
not
be
see
even
by
this
attendant
;
for
he
sit
in
an
inner
corner
of
his
own
dark
room
when
any
one
be
there
,
and
never
seem
to
move
at
other
time
,
except
to
pace
it
to
and
fro
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
morning
it
be
whisper
among
the
household
that
he
be
hear
to
go
up
stair
in
the
dead
night
,
and
that
he
stay
there
---
in
the
room
---
until
the
sun
be
shine
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
office
in
the
City
,
the
ground
-
glass
window
be
make
more
dim
by
shutter
;
and
while
the
light
lamp
upon
the
desk
be
half
extinguish
by
the
day
that
wander
in
,
the
day
be
half
extinguish
by
the
lamp
,
and
an
unusual
gloom
prevail
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
much
business
do
.
<EOS>
the
clerk
be
indispose
to
work
;
and
they
make
assignation
to
eat
chop
in
the
afternoon
,
and
go
up
the
river
.
<EOS>
Perch
,
the
messenger
,
stay
long
upon
his
errand
;
and
find
himself
in
bar
of
public
-
house
,
invite
thither
by
friend
,
and
hold
forth
on
the
uncertainty
of
human
affair
.
<EOS>
He
go
home
to
Ball
's
Pond
earlier
in
the
evening
than
usual
,
and
treat
Mrs
Perch
to
a
veal
cutlet
and
scotch
ale
.
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
treat
no
one
;
neither
be
he
treat
;
but
alone
in
his
own
room
he
show
his
tooth
all
day
;
and
it
would
seem
that
there
be
something
go
from
Mr
Carker
's
path
---
some
obstacle
reremoved
---
which
clear
his
way
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
now
the
rosy
child
live
opposite
to
Mr
Dombey
's
house
,
peep
from
their
nursery
window
down
into
the
street
;
for
there
be
four
black
horse
at
his
door
,
with
feather
on
their
head
;
and
feather
tremble
on
the
carriage
that
they
draw
;
and
these
,
and
an
array
of
man
with
scarf
and
stave
,
attract
a
crowd
.
<EOS>
the
juggler
who
be
go
to
twirl
the
basin
,
put
his
loose
coat
on
again
over
his
fine
dress
;
and
his
trudge
wife
,
one
-
side
with
her
heavy
baby
in
her
arm
,
loiter
to
see
the
company
come
out
.
<EOS>
but
closer
to
her
dingy
breast
she
press
her
baby
,
when
the
burden
that
be
so
easily
carry
be
bear
forth
;
and
the
young
of
the
rosy
child
at
the
high
window
opposite
,
need
no
restrain
hand
to
check
her
in
her
glee
,
when
,
point
with
her
dimpled
finger
,
she
look
into
her
nurse
's
face
,
and
ask
"
what
be
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
among
the
knot
of
servant
dress
in
mourning
,
and
the
weep
woman
,
Mr
Dombey
pass
through
the
hall
to
the
other
carriage
that
be
wait
to
receive
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
"
bring
down

"
these
observe

,
by
sorrow
and
distress
of
mind
.
<EOS>
His
walk
be
as
erect
,
his
bearing
be
as
stiff
as
ever
it
have
be
.
<EOS>
He
hide
his
face
behind
no
handkerchief
,
and
look
before
him
.
<EOS>
but
that
his
face
be
something
sink
and
rigid
,
and
be
pale
,
it
bear
the
same
expression
as
of
old
.
<EOS>
He
take
his
place
within
the
carriage
,
and
three
other
gentleman
follow
.
<EOS>
then
the
grand
funeral
move
slowly
down
the
street
.
<EOS>
the
feather
be
yet
nod
in
the
distance
,
when
the
juggler
have
the
basin
spin
on
a
cane
,
and
have
the
same
crowd
to
admire
it
.
<EOS>
but
the
juggler
's
wife
be
less
alert
than
usual
with
the
money
-
box
,
for
a
child
's
burial
<EOS>
have
set
her
thinking
that
perhaps
the
baby
underneath
her
shabby
shawl
may
not
grow
up
to
be
a
man
,
and
wear
a
sky
-
blue
fillet
round
his
head
,
and
salmon

colour
worst
drawer
,
and
tumble
in
the
mud

<EOS>
the
feather
wind
their
gloomy
way
along
the
street
,
and
come
within
the
sound
of
a
church
bell
.
<EOS>
in
this
same
church
,
the
pretty
boy
receive
all
that
will
soon
be
leave

<EOS>
all
of
him
that

they
lie
there

near
the
perishable
substance
of
his

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
Their
ashe

where
Florence
in
her
walk

<EOS>
the

and
the

Mr

<EOS>
Mr

the

"
You

<EOS>
the

with
a
hasty

,
pursue
his

<EOS>
when

He

<EOS>
the
chief

in

kitchen

be
that
"
it
seem
like
Sunday

<EOS>
"
They
can
hardly
persuade
themselves
but
that
there
be
something
unbecoming
,
if
not
wicked
,
in
the
conduct
of
the
people
out
of
door
,
who
pursue
their
ordinary
occupation

wear
everyday
attire

<EOS>
It
be
quite
a
novelty
to
have
the

the
shutter

and
they
make
themselves
dismally
comfortable
over
bottle
of
wine

which

freely
broach

on

<EOS>
They

<EOS>
They

very
tender

Towlinson
have
vision
of
lead
an
altered

blameless
existence
as
a
serious
greengrocer

Florence
,
my
dear
child
,
your
poor
Papa
be
peculiar
at
time

and
to

me
about

be
to
question
me
upon
a
subject

I
really
do
not
pretend

<EOS>
I
believe
I
have
as
much
influence
with
your

<EOS>
still
,
all
I
can
say
be
,
that
he
have
say
very
little
to
me
;
and
that
I
have
only
see
him
once
or
twice
for
a
minute
at
a
time
,
and
indeed
have
hardly
see
him
then

for
his
room
have
be
dark

<EOS>
I
have
say
to
your

I
use

Your

<EOS>
It

it

make
way
even
between
the

<EOS>
the
overcharged

heavy

sometimes
have
that
vent

the

solitary

<EOS>
"

Mrs

after
a
pause

I

I

Mrs

approve
of
this
resolution

dismiss
her
with
a
kiss

<EOS>
but
Miss

on
a
faint
pretence
of
look
for
the
mislaid
handkerchief

go
upstairs
after
her

and
try
in
a
few
steal
minute

the
vantage

ground
of
disinterestedness

there

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
be
Florence
so
alone
in
the
bleak
world
that
nothing

remain

her

<EOS>
nothing

<EOS>
Stricken
motherless
and
brotherless
at
once
---
for
in
the
loss
of
little
Paul
,
that
first
and
great
loss
fall
heavily
upon
her

this
be
the
only
help
she
have
.
<EOS>
oh
,
who
can
tell
how
much
she
need
help
at
first
!
  
<EOS>
at
first
,
when
the
house
subside
into
its
accustomed
course
,
and
they
have
all
go
away
,
except
the
servant
,
and
her
father
shut
up
in
his
own
room
,
Florence
could
do
nothing
but
weep
,
and
wander
up
and
down
,
and
sometimes
,
in
a
sudden
pang
of
desolate
remembrance
,
fly
to
her
own
chamber
,
wre
her
hand
,
lie
her
face
down
on
her
bed
,
and
know
no
consolation
:
nothing
but
the
bitterness
and
cruelty
of
grief
.
<EOS>
this
commonly
ensue
upon
the
recognition
of
some
spot
or
object
very
tenderly
associate
with
him
;
and
it
make
the
miserable
house
,
at
first
,
a
place
of
agony
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
in
the
nature
of
pure
love
to
burn
so
fiercely
and
unkindly
long
.
<EOS>
the
flame
that
in
its
gross
composition
have
the
taint
of
earth
,
may
prey
upon
the
breast
that
give
it
shelter
;
but
the
sacred
fire
from
heaven
be
as
gentle
in
the
heart
,
as
when
it
rest
on
the
head
of
the
assemble
twelve
,
and
show
each
man
his
brother
,
brightened
and
unhurt
.
<EOS>
the
image
conjure
up
,
there
soon
return
the
placid
face
,
the
soften
voice
,
the
loving
look
,
the
quiet
trustfulness
and
peace
;
and
Florence
,
though
she
weep
still
,
weep
more
tranquilly
,
and
court
the
remembrance
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
very
long
before
the
golden
water
,
dance
on
the
wall
,
in
the
old
place
,
at
the
old
serene
time
,
have
her
calm
eye
fix
upon
it
as
it
ebb
away
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
very
long
before
that
room
again
know
her
,
often
;
sit
there
alone
,
as
patient
and
as
mild
as
when
she
have
watch
beside
the
little
bed
.
<EOS>
when
any
sharp
sense
of
its
be
empty
smote
upon
her
,
she
could
kneel
beside
it
,
and
<EOS>
praygod
<EOS>
---
it
be
the
pouring
out
of
her
full
heart
---
to
let
one
angel
love
her
and
remember
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
very
long
before
,
in
the
midst
of
the
dismal
house
so
wide
and
dreary
,
her
low
voice
in
the
twilight
,
slowly
and
stop
sometimes
,
touch
the
old
air
to
which
he
have
so
often
listen
,
with
his
drooping
head
upon
her
arm
.
<EOS>
and
after
that
,
and
when
it
be
quite
dark
,
a
little
strain
of
music
tremble
in
the
room
:
so
softly
play
and
sing
,
that
it
be
more
like
the
mournful
recollection
of
what
she
have
do
at
his
request
on
that
last
night
,
than
the
reality
repeat
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
repeat
,
often
---
very
often
,
in
the
shadowy
solitude
;
and
break
murmur
of
the
strain
still
tremble
on
the
key
,
when
the
sweet
voice
be
hush
in
tear
.
  
<EOS>
thus
she
gain
heart
to
look
upon
the
work
with
which
her
finger
have
be
busy
by
his
side
on
the
sea
-
shore
;
and
thus
it
be
not
very
long
before
she
take
to
it
again
---
with
something
of
a
human
love
for
it
,
as
if
it
have
be
sentient
and
have
know
him
;
and
,
sit
in
a
window
,
near
her
mother
's
picture
,
in
the
unused
room
so
long
deserted
,
wear
away
the
thoughtful
hour
.
  
<EOS>
why
do
the
dark
eye
turn
so
often
from
this
work
to
where
the
rosy
child
live
?
<EOS>
They
be
not
immediately
suggestive
of
her
loss
;
for
they
be
all
girl
:
four
little
sister
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
motherless
like
her
---
and
have
a
father
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
know
when
he
have
go
out
and
be
expect
home
,
for
the
eld
child
be
always
dressed
and
wait
for
him
at
the
drawing
-
room
window
,
or
in
the
balcony
;
and
when
he
appear
,
her
expectant
face
light
up
with
joy
,
while
the
other
at
the
high
window
,
and
always
on
the
watch
too
,
clap
their
hand
,
and
drum
them
on
the
sill
,
and
call
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
eld
child
would
come
down
to
the
hall
,
and
put
her
hand
in
his
,
and
lead
him
up
the
stair
;
and
Florence
would
see
her
afterwards
sit
by
his
side
,
or
on
his
knee
,
or
hang
coaxingly
about
his
neck
and
talk
to
him
:
and
though
they
be
always
gay
together
,
he
would
often
watch
her
face
as
if
he
think
her
like
her
mother
that
be
dead
.
<EOS>
Florence
would
sometimes
look
no
more
at
this
,
and
burst
into
tear
would
hide
behind
the
curtain
as
if
she
be
frightened
,
or
would
hurry
from
the
window
.
<EOS>
yet
she
could
not
help
return
;
and
her
work
would
soon
fall
unheeded
from
her
hand
again
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
house
that
have
be
empty
,
year
ago
,
It
have
remain
so
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
and
while
she
have
be
away
from
home
,
this
family
have
take
it
;
and
it
be
repair
and
newly
paint
;
and
there
be
bird
and
flower
about
it
;
and
it
look
very
different
from
its
old
self
.
<EOS>
but
she
never
think
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
the
child
and
their
father
be
all
in
all
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
dine
,
she
could
see
them
,
through
the
open
window
,
go
down
with
their
governess
or
nurse
,
and
cluster
round
the
table
;
and
in
the
still
summer
weather
,
the
sound
of
their
childish
voice
and
clear
laughter
would
come
ring
across
the
street
,
into
the
droop
air
of
the
room
in
which
she
sit
.
<EOS>
then
they
would
climb
and
clamber
up
stair
with
him
,
and
romp
about
him
on
the
sofa
,
or
group
themselves
at
his
knee
,
a
very
nosegay
of
little
face
,
while
he
seem
to
tell
them
some
story
.
<EOS>
or
they
would
come
run
out
into
the
balcony
;
and
then
Florence
would
hide
herself
quickly
,
lest
it
should
check
them
in
their
joy
,
to
see
her
in
her
black
dress
,
sit
there
alone
.
  
<EOS>
the
eld
child
remain
with
her
father
when
the
rest
have
go
away
,
and
make
his
tea
for
him
---
<EOS>
happy
little
housekeeper
<EOS>
she
be
then
!
<EOS>
---
and
sit
converse
with
him
,
sometimes
at
the
window
,
sometimes
in
the
room
,
until
the
candle
come
.
<EOS>
He
make
her
his
companion
,
though
she
be
some
year
young
than
Florence
;
and
she
could
be
as
staid
and
pleasantly
demure
,
with
her
little
book
or
work
-
box
,
as
a
woman
.
<EOS>
when
they
have
candle
,
Florence
from
her
own
dark
room
be
not
afraid
to
look
again
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
time
come
for
the
child
to
say
"
good
night
,
papa
,
"
and
go
to
bed
,
Florence
would
sob
and
tremble
as
she
raise
her
face
to
him
,
and
could
look
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
though
still
she
would
turn

so
often

long
ago
,
and
from
the
other
low
soft
broken
strain
of
music

back
to
that
house

<EOS>
but
that
she
ever

or
watch
it

be
a
secret
which
she
keep
within
her
own
young
breast

<EOS>
and
do
that
breast
of
Florence
---
<EOS>
Florence
,
so
ingenuous
and
true

so
worthy
of
the
love
that
he
have
bear
her

and
have
whisper
in
his
last
faint
word

whose
guileless
heart
be
mirror
in
the
beauty
of
her
face

her
gentle
voice

any

<EOS>
yes

one

<EOS>
when

she
would
softly
leave
her
own
room
,
and
with
noiseless
foot
descend
the
staircase
,
and
approach
her
father
's
door
.
<EOS>
against
it
,
scarcely
breathing
,
she
would
rest
her
face
and
head
,
and
press
her
lip
,
in
the
yearning
of
her
love
.
<EOS>
She
crouch
upon
the
cold
stone
floor
outside
it
,
every
night
,
to
listen
even
for
his
breath
;
and
in
her
one
absorb
wish
to
be
allow
to
show
him
some
affection
,
to
be
a
consolation
to
him
,
to
win
him
over
to
the
endurance
of
some
tenderness
from
her
,
his
solitary
child
,
she
would
have
kneel
down
at
his
foot
,
if
she
have
dare
,
in
humble
supplication
.
  
<EOS>
no
one
know
it

<EOS>
no
one
thought
of
it

<EOS>
the
door
be
ever
close

he
shut
up
within

<EOS>
He
go
out
once
or
twice

and
it
be

in
the

he
live
in

live
alone
,
and
never
see

<EOS>
perhaps
he

I
could

up

I
would

they
be
glad

get

he

He
be
not
a

you

you
will
not
mind
that
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
fact
Diogenes
be
at
that
moment
,
as
they
presently
ascertain
from
look
down
into
the
street
,
stare
through
the
window
of
a
hackney
cabriolet
,
into
which
,
for
conveyance
to
that
spot
,
he
have
be
ensnare
,
on
a
false
pretence
of
rat
among
the
straw
.
<EOS>
Sooth
to
say
,
he
be
as
unlike
a
lady
's
dog
as
may
be
;
and
in
his
gruff
anxiety
to
get
out
,
present
an
appearance
sufficiently
unpromising
,
as
he
give
short
yelps
out
of
one
side
of
his
mouth
,
and
overbalance
himself
by
the
intensity
of
every
one
of
those
effort
,
tumble
down
into
the
straw
,
and
then
spring
pant
up
again
,
put
out
his
tongue
,
as
if
he
have
come
express
to
a
Dispensary
to
be
examine
for
his
health
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
Diogenes
be
as
ridiculous
a
dog
as
one
would
meet
with
on
a
summer
's
day
;
a
blundering
,
ill
-
favour
,
clumsy
,
bullet
-
head
dog

continually
act
on
a
wrong
idea
that
there
be
an
enemy
in
the
neighbourhood

whom
it
be
meritorious
to
bark
at
;

and
though
he
be
far
from
good

temper
,

certainly
be
not
clever
,
and
have
hair
all
over
his
eye
,
and
a
comic
nose
,
and
an
inconsistent
tail
,
and
a
gruff
voice
;
he
be
dearer
to
Florence
,
in
virtue
of
that
parting
remembrance
of
him
,
and
that
request
that
he
may
be
take
care
of
,
than
the
most
valuable

beautiful
of

<EOS>
so
dear
,
indeed
,
be
this

ugly
Diogenes

so
welcome
to
her

that
she
take
the
jewelled
hand
of
Mr

kiss
it
in
her
gratitude

<EOS>
and
when
Diogenes
,
release
,
come
tear
up
the
stair
and
bounce
into
the
room
(
such
a
business
as
there
be
first
,
to
get
him
out
of
the
cabriolet
!

,
dive
under
all
the
furniture
,
and
wound
a
long
iron
chain
,
that
dangle
from
his
neck
,
round
leg
of
chair
and
table
,
and
then
tug
at
it
until
his
eye
become
unnaturally
visible
,
in
consequence
of
their
nearly
start
out
of
his
head
;
and
when
he
growl
at
Mr
Toots
,
who
affect
familiarity
;

go
pell

mell
at
Towlinson

morally
convince
that
he
be
the
enemy
whom
he
have
bark
at
round
the
corner
all
his
life

have
never

yet

pleased

him
as
if

a
miracle
of
discretion

Mr

overjoyed
by
the
success

his

,

be
so
delighted
to
see
Florence
bend
down
over
diogene

smooth
his
coarse
back
with
her
little
delicate
hand

<EOS>
Diogenes
graciously
allow
it
from
the
first
moment
of
their
acquaintance

that
he
feel
it
difficult
to
take
leave
,
and
would

no

have
be
a
much
long
time
in
make
up
his
mind
to
do
so

if

who
suddenly
take

into

Mr

to
make
short
run
at

open

with

out
at

by

after
look

two

without
any

at
all

be
on

off

away

his
shaggy

the
rough

gruff

as
if

hairy
hide
be
pervious
to
the
tear
that
drop
upon
it
,
and
his
dog

heart
melt
as
it
fall

put
his
nose
up

swear
fidelity

He

to
her
service

him
in

coil
himself
up

also
to
utter
little
scream

chair

Diogenes
stretch
himself
:
she
be
in
her
own
manner
affect
by
the
kindness
of
Mr
Toots

and
could
not
see
Florence
so
alive
to
the
attachment
and
society
of
this
rude
friend
of
little
Paul

,
without

Mr

as
a
part
of
her
reflection

may
have
be
,
in
the
association
of
ideas

connect
with
the

but
,
at
any
rate
,
after
observe
Diogenes
and
his
mistress
all
the
evening
,
and
after
exert
herself
with
much
good
-
will
to
provide
Diogenes
a
bed
in
an
ante
-
chamber
outside
his
mistress
's
door
,
she
say
hurriedly
to
Florence
,
before
leave
her
for
the
night
:
  
"
Your
Pa

He

and
I
must
say
if
I

any

(
which
Heavens

,
it
should
not

"
Hush

urge
Florence
gently
.
  
<EOS>
"
well

Miss

return
Miss

who
be
full
of
burn
indignation

even
less

<EOS>
"
I

natural

none

"
  
<EOS>
It
appear
from
what
she
add
and
have
glean
downstairs
,
that
Mrs
Chick
have
propose
the
Major
for
Mr
Dombey
's
companion
,
and
that
Mr
Dombey
,
after
some
hesitation

have
invite
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
talk

him
be
a

indeed

"
observe
Miss

to
herself
with
boundless
contempt

<EOS>
"
if
he
be

give
me
a

"
  
"
good

Florence

<EOS>
"
good
night

my
darling
dear
Miss
Floy

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
tone
of
commiseration
smote
the
chord
so
often
roughly
touch
,
but
never
listen
to
while
she
or
any
one
look
on
.
<EOS>
Florence
leave
alone
,
lay
her
head
upon
her
hand
,
and
press
the
other
over
her
swell
heart
,
hold
free
communication
with
her
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
wet
night
;
and
the
melancholy
rain
fall
patter
and
drop
with
a
weary
sound
.
<EOS>
a
sluggish
wind
be
blow
,
and
go
moan
round
the
house
,
as
if
it
be
in
pain
or
grief
.
<EOS>
a
shrill
noise
quiver
through
the
tree
.
<EOS>
while
she
sit
weep
,
it
grow
late
,
and
dreary
midnight
toll
out
from
the
steeple
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
be
little
more
than
a
child
in
year
---
not
yet
fourteen
---
and
the
loneliness
and
gloom
of
such
an
hour
in
the
great
house
where
Death
have
lately
make
its
own
tremendous
devastation
,
may
have
set
an
old
fancy
brooding
on
vague
terror
.
<EOS>
but
her
innocent
imagination
be
too
full
of
one
theme
to
admit
them
.
<EOS>
nothing
wander
in
her
thought
but
love
---
a
wander
love
,
indeed
,
and
cast
away
---
but
turn
always
to
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
in
the
dropping
of
the
rain
,
the
moaning
of
the
wind
,
the
shuddering
of
the
tree
,
the
striking
of
the
solemn
clock
,
that
shake
this
one
thought
,
or
diminish
its
interest
.
<EOS>
Her
recollection
of
the
dear
dead
boy
---
and
they
be
never
absent
---
be
itself
;
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
and
oh
,
to
be
shut
out
:
to
be
so
lose
:
never
to
have
look
into
her
father
's
face
or
touch
him
since
that
hour
!
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
go
to
bed
,
poor
child
,
and
never
have
go
yet
,
since
then
,
without
make
her
nightly
pilgrimage
to
his
door
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
a
strange
sad
sight
,
to
see
her
now
,
steal
lightly
down
the
stair
through
the
thick
gloom
,
and
stop
at
it
with
a
beat
heart
,
and
blind
eye
,
and
hair
that
fall
down
loosely
and
unthought
of
;
and
touch
it
outside
with
her
wet
cheek
.
<EOS>
but
the
night
cover
it
,
and
no
one
know
.
  
<EOS>
the
moment
that
she
touch
the
door
on
this
night
,
Florence
find
that
it
be
open
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
it
stand
open
,
though
by
but
a
hair's
-
breadth
:
and
there
be
a
light
within
.
<EOS>
the
first
impulse
of
the
timid
child
---
and
she
yield
to
it
---
be
to
retire
swiftly
.
<EOS>
Her
next
,
to
go
back
,
and
to
enter
;
and
this
second
impulse
hold
her
in
irresolution
on
the
stair
-
case
.
  
<EOS>
in
its
standing
open
,
even
by
so
much
as
that
chink
,
there
seem
to
be
hope
.
<EOS>
there
be
encouragement
in
see
a
ray
of
light
from
within
,
steal
through
the
dark
stern
door
-
way
,
and
fall
in
a
thread
upon
the
marble
floor
.
<EOS>
She
turn
back
,
hardly
know
what
she
do
,
but
urge
on
by
the
love
within
her
,
and
the
trial
they
have
undergo
together
,
but
not
share
:
and
with
her
hand
a
little
raise
and
tremble
,
glide
in
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
sit
at
his
old
table
in
the
middle
room
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
arrange
some
paper
,
and
destroy
other
,
and
the
latter
lie
in
fragile
ruin
before
him
.
<EOS>
the
rain
drip
heavily
upon
the
glass
pan
in
the
outer
room
,
where
he
have
so
often
watch
poor
Paul
,
a
baby
;
and
the
low
complaining
of
the
wind
be
hear
without
.
  
<EOS>
but
not
by
him
.
<EOS>
He
sit
with
his
eye
fix
on
the
table
,
so
immersed
in
thought
,
that
a
far
heavy
tread
than
the
light
foot
of
his
child
could
make
,
may
have
fail
to
rouse
him
.
<EOS>
His
face
be
turn
towards
her
.
<EOS>
by
the
wane
lamp
,
and
at
the
haggard
hour
,
it
look
worn
and
dejected
;
and
in
the
utter
loneliness
surround
him
,
there
be
an
appeal
to
Florence
that
strike
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
!
<EOS>
Papa
!
<EOS>
speak
to
me
,
dear
papa

"
  
<EOS>
He
start
at
her
voice
,
and
leap
up
from
his
seat
.
<EOS>
She
be
close
before
him
,
with
extended
arm
,
but
he
fall
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
come
here
?
<EOS>
what
have
frighten
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
if
anything
have
frighten
her
,
it
be
the
face
he
turn
upon
her
.
<EOS>
the
glowing
love
within
the
breast
of
his
young
daughter
freeze
before
it
,
and
she
stand
and
look
at
him
as
if
stricken
into
stone
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
not
one
touch
of
tenderness
or
pity
in
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
one
gleam
of
interest
,
parental
recognition
,
or
relent
in
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
change
in
it
,
but
not
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
the
old
indifference
and
cold
constraint
have
give
place
to
something
:
what
,
she
never
think
and
do
not
dare
to
think
,
and
yet
she
feel
it
in
its
force
,
and
know
it
well
without
a
name
:
that
as
it
look
upon
her
,
seem
to
cast
a
shadow
on
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
do
he
see
before
him
the
successful
rival
of
his
son
,
in
health
and
life
?
<EOS>
do
he
look
upon
his
own
successful
rival
of
his
son
,
in
that
son
's
affection
?
<EOS>
do
a
mad
jealousy
and
withered
pride
,
poison
sweet
remembrance
that
should
have
endear
and
make
her
precious
to
him
?
<EOS>
Could
it
be
possible
that
it
be
gall
to
him
to
look
upon
her
in
her
beauty
and
her
promise
:
think
of
his
infant
boy
!
  
<EOS>
Florence
have
no
such
thought
.
<EOS>
but
love
be
quick
to
know
when
it
be
spurn
and
hopeless
:
and
hope
die
out
of
hers
,
as
she
stand
look
in
her
father

face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I

She
see
he
know
why
:
it
be
write
broadly
on
his

:
and
drop
her
head
upon
her
hand
with
one
prolonged
low
cry

<EOS>
let

remember
it
in

It

It

let

He
take

<EOS>
His

be
cold

You

still

silently
ascend

once
she
look
back
as

but
for
fear

<EOS>
It
be
a
momentary

too
hopeless

and
her
father
stand
there
with
the
light

hard

unresponsive

motionless

until

his
tarnished
uniform

obdurate

conceited

no

I
ever
have
here

I
be

be
so
little
mine

the
dream
may
come
back
in
my
sleep
,
and
I
may
return
wake
to
this
place
,
it
may
be
:
but
the
dream
at

will
serve
no
other
master

the
room
may
have
a
score
,

every
one

them
may
change

neglect

misuse
it

<EOS>
Mr

be
out

to

a
part
word

I

I
may

you

my

yes

so
I
see
her

pursue

<EOS>
Susan
,
I
mean

I
tell
her
I
be
off

away

morrow

<EOS>
and
I
say
,
Uncle

that
you
have
always
have
an
interest
in
Miss

since
that
night
when
she
be
here
,

always
wish
her
well

happy
,
and
always
would
be
proud
and
glad
to
serve
her
in
the

I
think
I

do
not
you

so

yes

my

tone

I
add
,
"
pursue
Walter

that
if
she

Susan

I

could
ever

either

Mrs
Richards

anybody
else

may
be
come
this

that
Miss

you

there

<EOS>
upon

Walter

I
scarcely
sleep
all
last
night

thinking
of
do
this

could
not
make
up
my
kind
when
I
be
out

whether
to
do
it

not

yet
I
be
sure
it
be
the
true
feeling

I
should
have
be
quite
miserable
afterwards

<EOS>
His
honest
voice

manner
corroborate
what

so

Uncle

I

perhaps
you

tell
her
how
much
I
feel
for
her

how
much
I
use

how
I
speak

with
the
tear

gentle
manner

her
beautiful
face

her
sweet
kind
disposition

be
well

and
as
I
do
not
take
them
from
a
woman

foot

young
lady

:
only
a
little
innocent
child

tell

night

away
with

a
remembrance

"
  
<EOS>
They
be
at
that
very
moment
go
out
at
the
door
in
one
of
Walter
's
trunk
.
<EOS>
a
porter
carry
off
his
baggage
on
a
truck
for
shipment
at
the
dock
on
board
the
Son

Heir

have
get
possession
of
them
;
and
wheel
them
away
under
the
very
eye
of
the
insensible
Midshipman
before
their
owner
have
well
finish
speak
.
  
<EOS>
but
that
ancient
mariner
may
have
be
excuse
his
insensibility
to
the
treasure
as
it
roll
away

<EOS>
for
,
under
his
eye
at
the
same
moment
,
accurately
within
his
range
of
observation

come
full
into
the
sphere
of
his
startled
and
intensely
wide

awake
look

out

Florence

Susan
Nipper
:
Florence
look
up
into
his
face
half
timidly
,
and
receive
the
whole
shock
of
his
wooden
ogling
!
  
<EOS>
More
than
this
,
they
pass
into
the
shop
,
and
pass
in
at
the
parlour
door
before
they
be
observe
by
anybody
but
the
Midshipman
.
<EOS>
and
Walter
,
have
his
back
to
the
door
,
would
have
know
nothing
of
their
apparition
even
then
,
but
for
see
his
uncle
spring
out
of
his

nearly
tumble
over
another

"

up
in

it
be
so
possible

so
actual

that

while

word
be
on
his

Florence
hurry
past
him
;
take
Uncle

one
in

kiss
him
on

and
turn

give
her
hand
to

a
simple

not
so
hopefully
as
he
endeavour
:

I

"
exclaim
Miss
Nipper

"
there
be
a
many
we
could
spare

if

Mrs
Pipchin
as
a
overseer
would
come
cheap
at
her
weight
in
gold

if

them
Blimbers

the
very
people

<EOS>
with
that
Miss
Nipper
untie
her
bonnet
string
,
and
after
look
vacantly
for
some
moment
into
a
little
black
teapot
that
be
set
forth
with
the
usual
homely
service
on
the
table
,
shake
her
head
and
a
tin
canister
,
and
begin
unasked
to
make
the
tea

in

turn
again
to
the
instrument

maker

admiration
as
surprise

"
Ye

return
old
Sol
,
rub
his
hand
slowly
,
and
consider
the
matter
half
aloud
,
as
something
pensive

the
bright
eye

at
him
arrest
his
attention
.
<EOS>
"
yes

<EOS>
"
You

"
My

how

often

I
have

at

I
be
afraid
you

go
away

"
and
again
she
give
him
her
little
hand
so
freely
<EOS>
and
so
faithfully
that
Walter
hold
it
for
some
moment
in
his
own
,
and
could
not
bear
to
let
it
go
.
  
<EOS>
yet
Walter
do
not
hold
it
as
he
may
have
hold
it
once
,
nor
do
its
touch
awaken
those
old
day
-
dream
of
his
boyhood
that
have
float
past
him
sometimes
even
lately
,
and
confuse
him
with
their
indistinct
and
broken
shape
.
<EOS>
the
purity
and
innocence
of
her
endearing
manner
,
and
its
perfect
trustfulness
,
and
the
undisguised
regard
for
him
that
lie
so
deeply
seated
in
her
constant
eye
,

glow
upon
her
fair
face
through
the
smile
that
shade
---
for
alas
!
<EOS>
it
be
a
smile
too
sad
to
brighten
---
it
,
be
not
of
their
romantic
race
.
<EOS>
They
bring
back
to
his
thought
the
early
deathbed
he
have
see
her
tending
,
and
the
love
the
child
have
bear
her
;
and
on
the
wing
of
such
remembrance
she
seem
to
rise
up
,
far
above
his
idle
fancy
,
into
clear
and
serene
air

this
be
what
I
wish
to
say
,
dear
Walter

I
can
not

it
as
I
would

because
my
heart
be
full

<EOS>
and
in
its
fulness

take
them

stoop
down

touch
the
tearful
face
that
neither
shrink

turn
away

nor
redden
as
he
do
so

look
up

confidence

truth

<EOS>
in
that
one
moment
,
every
shadow
of
doubt

agitation
pass
away
from
Walter

soul

<EOS>
It
seem
to
him
that
he
respond
to
her
innocent
appeal
,
beside
the
dead
child
's
bed
:
and
,
in
the
solemn
presence
he
have
see
there
,
pledge
himself
to
cherish
and
protect
her
very
image
,
in
his
banishment
,
with
brotherly
regard
;
to
garner
up
her
simple
faith
,
inviolate
;
and
hold
himself
degrade
if
he
breathe
upon
it
any
thought
that
be
not
in
her
own
breast
when
she
give
it
to
him

<EOS>
Susan
Nipper
,
who
have
bite
both
her
bonnet
string
at
once
,
and
impart
a
great
deal
of
private
emotion
to
the
skylight

this
transaction

the
subject
by

these
point

pour
out
the

They
all
four
gather
socially
about
the
little
table

and
take
tea
under
that
young
lady
's
active
superintendence
;

the
presence
of
Florence
in

back
parlour

brighten
the
Tartar

<EOS>
half
an
hour
ago
Walter
,
for
his
life

would
have
hardly
call
her
by
her
name
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
do
so
now
when
she
entreat
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
think
of
her
be
there
,
without
a
lurking
misgiving
that
it
would
have
be
well
if
she
have
not
come
.
<EOS>
He
could
calmly
think
how
beautiful
she
be
,
how
full
of
promise
,
what
a
home
<EOS>
some
happy
man
would
find
in
such
a
heart
one
day
.
<EOS>
He
could
reflect
upon
his
own
place
in
that
heart
,
with
pride
;
and
with
a
brave
determination
,
if
not
to
deserve
it
---
he
still
think
that
far
above
him
---
never
to
deserve
it
less

<EOS>
some
fairy
influence
must
surely
have
hover
round
the
hand
of
Susan
Nipper
when
she
make
the
tea
,
engender
the
tranquil
air
that
reign
in
the
back
parlour
during
its
discussion
.
<EOS>
some
counter
-
influence
must
surely
have
hover
round
the
hand
of
Uncle
Sol
's
chronometer
,
and
move
them
faster
than
the
Tartar
frigate
ever
go
before
the
wind

<EOS>
be
this
as
it
may
,
the
visitor

a

such
a
positive
opinion

that
it

the
fact

state

if
Uncle
Sol
have

go
to

by
his

he
never

that
the

a
second

<EOS>
florence
at
parting
recapitulate
to
the
old
man
all
that
she
have
say
before

him

Uncle

an
indistinct

undefined
existence
since
that
recent
night
when
she
have
go
down

that
Walter

accidental

notwithstanding

<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
in
his
estimation
of
himself
and
his
money
,
feel
that
this
be
very
true
,
and
therefore
do
not
dispute
the
point
.
<EOS>
but
the
instinctive
recognition
of
such
a
truth
by
the
Major
,
and
his
plain
avowal
of
it
,
be
very
agreeable
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
confirmation
to
Mr
Dombey
,
if
he
have
require
any
,
of
his
not
be
mistake
in
the
Major
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
assurance
to
him
that
his
power
extend
beyond
his
own
immediate
sphere
;
and
that
the
Major
,
as
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
,
have
a
no
less
becoming
sense
of
it
,
than
the
beadle
of
the
Royal
Exchange
.
  
<EOS>
and
if
it
be
ever
consolatory
to
know
this
,
or
the
like
of
this
,
it
be
consolatory
then
,
when
the
impotence
of
his
will
,
the
instability
of
his
hope
,
the
feebleness
of
wealth
,
have
be
so
direfully
impressed
upon
him
.
<EOS>
what
could
it
do
,
his
boy
have
ask
him
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
think
of
the
baby
question
,
he
could
hardly
forbear
inquire
,
himself
,
what
could
it
do
indeed
:
what
have
it
do
?
  
<EOS>
but
these
be
lonely
thought
,
breed
late
at
night
in
the
sullen
despondency
and
gloom
of
his
retirement
,
and
pride
easily
find
its
reassurance
in
many
testimony
to
the
truth
,
as
unimpeachable
and
precious
as
the
Major
's
.
<EOS>
Mr

,
in
his
friendlessness
,
incline
to
the
Major

<EOS>
It
can
not
be
say
that
he
warm
towards
him
,
but
he
thaw
a
little
.
<EOS>
the
Major
have
have
some
part
---
and
not
too
much
---
in
the
day
by
the
seaside
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
of
the
world
,
and
know
some
great
people
.
<EOS>
He
talk
much
,
and
tell
story
;
and
Mr
Dombey
be
dispose
to
regard
him
as
a
choice
spirit
who
shine
in
society
,
and
who
have
not
that
poisonous
ingredient
of
poverty
with
which
choice
spirit
in
general
be
too
much
adulterate
.
<EOS>
His
station
be
undeniable
.
<EOS>
altogether
the
Major
be
a
creditable
companion
,
well
accustomed
to
a
life
of
leisure
,
and
to
such
place
as
that
they
be
about
to
visit
,
and
have
an
air
of
gentlemanly
ease
about
him
that
mix
well
enough
with
his

city
character
,
and
do
not
compete
with
it
at
all
.
<EOS>
if
Mr

have
any
linger
idea
that
the

,
as
a
man
accustomed
,
in
the
way
of
his
calling
,
to
make
light
of
the
ruthless
have
<EOS>
that
hand
lately
crush
his
hope
,
may
unconsciously
impart
some
useful
philosophy
to
him
,
and
scare
away
his
weak
regret
,
he
hide
it
from
himself
,
and
leave
it
lie
at
the
bottom
of
his
pride
,
unexamine

"
where

so

pursue

all
thing
look
black

deadly
upon

<EOS>
He
find
a

his
misfortune
everywhere

<EOS>
there
be
a
remorseless
triumph
go
on
about
him

and
it
gall

sting
him
in
his
pride

jealousy
,
<EOS>
whatever
form
it
take
:
<EOS>
though
most
of
all
when
it
divide

him
the
love

memory

his
lost
boy

<EOS>
there
be
a
face
<EOS>
---
he
have
look
upon
it
,
on
the
previous
night

and
it
on
him
with
eye
that
read
his
soul
,
though
they
be
dim
with
tear

hide
soon
behind
two
quiver
hand

that
often
have
attend
him
in
fancy
,
on
this
ride

<EOS>
He
have
see
it
,
with
the
expression
of
last
night
,
timidly
plead
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
reproachful
,
but
there
be
something
of
doubt
,
almost
of
hopeful
incredulity
in
it
,
which
,
as
he
once
more
see
that
fade
away
into
a
desolate
certainty
of
his
dislike
,
be
like
reproach
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
trouble
to
him
to
think
of
this
face
of
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
because
he
feel
any
new
compunction
towards
it
?
<EOS>
no

<EOS>
because
the
feeling
it
awaken
in
him
---
of
which
he
have
have
some
old
foreshadowing
in
old
time
---
be
full
-
formed
now
,
and
speak
out
plainly
,
move
him
too
much
,
and
threaten
to
grow
too
strong
for
his
composure
.
<EOS>
because
the
face
be
abroad
,
in
the
expression
of
defeat
and
persecution
that
seem
to
encircle
him
like
the
air
.
<EOS>
because
it
barb
the
arrow
of
that
cruel
and
remorseless
enemy
on
which
his
thought
so
run
,
and
put
into
its
grasp
a
double
-
handed
sword

<EOS>

he
know
full
well

in

find
both

so
that
when
evening
come
on
,
and
find
them
trot
through
the
green
and
leafy
road
near
Leamington
,
the

appear

<EOS>
nor
do
the

improve
it
at
the
Royal

where
room

dinner
have
be
order

and
where
he
so
oppress
his
organ
of
speech
by
eat

that
when
he
retire
to
bed
he
have
no
voice
at
all

except

cough
with

could
only
make

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
at
this
meal
they
arrange

<EOS>
the

be
to
take
the
responsibility

order
everything
to
eat

drink
;
and
they
be
to
have
a
late
breakfast
together
every
morning
,
and
a
late
dinner
together
every

<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
would
prefer
remain
in
his
own
room
,
or
walk
in
the
country
by
himself
,
on
that
first
day
of
their
sojourn
at
Leamington
;
but
next
morning
he
would
be
happy
to
accompany
the
Major
to
the
pump

room
,
and
about
the
town
.
<EOS>
so
they
part

dinner

<EOS>
Mr

retire

look
up

there

<EOS>
It
be
surprising
how
much

give
Mr

Mr

overstep
the
enchanted
circle
within
which
the

of

Son

begin
to
think
this
an
improvement
on
his
solitary

in

for
another

as

have

a
Trifle
of
Management
by
Mr

Manager
 
<EOS>
MR
CARKER
<EOS>
the
Manager
sit
at
his
desk
,
smooth
and
soft
as
usual
,
read
those
letter
which
be
reserve
for
him
to
open
,
back
them
occasionally
with
such
memorandum
and
reference
as
their
business
purport
require
,
and
parcel
them
out
into
little
heap
for
distribution
through
the
several
department
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
the
post
have
come
in
heavy
that
morning
,
and
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
have
a
good
deal
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
the
general
action
of
a
man
so
engaged
---
pause
to
look
over
a
bundle
of
paper
in
his
hand
,
deal
them
round
in
various
portion
,
take
up
another
bundle
and
examine
its
content
with
knit
brow
and
purse
-
out
lip
---
deal
,
and
sort
,
and
ponder
by
turn
---
would
easily
suggest
some
whimsical
resemblance
to
a
player
at
card
.
<EOS>
the
face
of
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
be
in
good
keeping
with
such
a
fancy
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
face
of
a
man
who
study
his
play
,
warily
:
who
make
himself
master
of
all
the
strong
and
weak
point
of
the
game
:
who
register
the
card
in
his
mind
as
they
fall
about
him
,
know
exactly
what
be
on
them
,
what
they
miss
,
and
what
they
make
:
who
be
crafty
to
find
out
what
the
other
player
hold
,
and
who
never
betray
his
own
hand
.
  
<EOS>
the
letter
be
in
various
language
,
but
Mr
Carker
the

read
them
all

<EOS>
if
there
have
be
anything
in
the
office
of

not

there
would
have
be
a
card
want
in
the
pack

He
read
almost
at
a
glance
,
and
make
combination
of
one
letter
with
another
and
one
business
with
another
as
he
go
on
,
add
new
matter
to
the
heap
---
much
as
a
man
would
know
the
card
at
sight
,
and
work
out
their
combination
in
his
mind
after
they
be
turn
.
<EOS>
something
too
deep
for
a
partner
,
and
much
too
deep
for
an
adversary

down

away
into

he
hardly
take
his
eye

moment
at
a
time
to
steal
a
sorrowful
glance
at

<EOS>
this
Mr

in

accumulate
nameless
terror
on
his
presumptuous
head
,
for
come
to
the
whereabout
of
Dombey

<EOS>
that
he
have
relent
,
in
consideration
of
his
youth

his
professed
contribution

his
friend

<EOS>
that
he
be
afraid
he
take
a
rash
step
in
do
anything
for
the
boy
,
and
one
that
may
expose
him
to
the
censure
of
the
prudent
;
but
that
he
do
it
of
himself
and
for
himself
,
and
risk
the
consequence
single
-
handed
;
and
that
his
mother
's
past
connection
with
Mr
Dombey

family
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
and
that
Mr

have
nothing
to

,
but
that
he
,
Mr

be
the
be

all

all
of

<EOS>
take
great
credit

no

indirectly

still
pretty
plainly

that
Rob

implicit
fidelity

attachment
,

devotion
,
be
for
evermore
his
due
,

the

homage
he
could
receive

<EOS>
and
with
this
great
truth
Rob
himself
be
so
impressed

that
stand
gaze
on
his

with
tear
roll
down
his
cheek
,
he
nod
his
shiny
head
until
it

will
try
how
true

I
will
prove

<EOS>
make
this
,
by
his
display
of
tooth
and
by
the
action
of
his
head

as
much
a
threat
as
a
promise

he
turn
from
Rob

eye
,
which
be
nail
upon
him
as
if
he
have
win
the
boy
by
a
charm

body

soul
,
and
ride
away
.
<EOS>
but
again
become
conscious
,
after
trot
a
short
distance

that
his

girt

be
yield
him
the

off

to
insure
his
obedience

turn
in

watch
him
as

retire

It
be
curious
to
see
that
even
then
Rob
could
not
keep
his
eye
wholly
avert
from
his
patron
's
face
,
but
,
constantly
turn
and
turn
again
to
look
after
him
,
involve
himself
in
a
tempest
of
buffeting
and
jostling
from
the
other
passenger
in

Mr

about

three
time

for

small
consideration
of

<EOS>
the
Game

who
be
quite
the
Apollo

Mr

have
introduce
to
him

it

even

the
gloss
of
novelty
upon

that
Mr

feel

he
do
not

unsettled
and
uneasy
.
<EOS>
there
be
husk
in

that
even
Game

could
not
peck
up

gloomy
giant
in

that
even

<EOS>
nothing
seem
to
do
Mr

so
much
good
as
incessantly
leave
card
at
Mr
Dombey
's
door
.
<EOS>
no
tax

gatherer
in
the
british
dominion
---
that
wide

spread
territory
on
which
the
sun
never

and
where
the
tax

gatherer
never
go
to

be
more
regular
and
persevere
in
his
call
than
Mr
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
never
go
up
stair
;
and
always
perform
the
same
ceremony
,
richly
dress
for
the
purpose
,
at
the
hall
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
good
morning
!
<EOS>
"
would
be
Mr
Toots
's
first
remark
to
the
servant
.
"
<EOS>
for
Mr
Dombey
,
"
would
be
Mr
Toots
's
next
remark
,
as
he
hand
in
a
card
.
"
<EOS>
for
Miss
Dombey
,
"
would
be
his
next
,
as
he
hand
in
another
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
would
then
turn
round
as
if
to
go
away
;
but
the
man
know
him
by
this
time
,
and
know
he
would
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
Mr
Toots
would
say
,
as
if
a
thought
have
suddenly
descend
on
him
.
"
<EOS>
be
the
young
woman
at
home
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
man
would
rather
think
she
be
,
but
would
not
quite
know
.
<EOS>
then
he
would
ring
a
bell
that
ring
upstairs
,
and
would
look
up
the
staircase
,
and
would
say
,
yes
,
she
be
at
home
,
and
be
come
down
.
<EOS>
then
Miss
Nipper
would
appear
,
and
the
man
would
retire
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
de
do
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
would
say
,
with
a
chuckle
and
a
blush
.
  
<EOS>
Susan
would
thank
him
,
and
say
she
be
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
diogene
go
on
?
"
would
be
Mr
Toot
's
second
interrogation
.
  
<EOS>
very
well
indeed
.
<EOS>
Miss
Florence
be
fonder
and
fonder
of
him
every
day
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
be
sure
to
hail
this
with
a
burst
of
chuckle
,
like
the
opening
of
a
bottle
of
some
effervescent
beverage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Florence
be
quite
well
,
Sir
,
"
Susan
would
add
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
it
be
of
no
consequence
,
thank'ee
,
"
be
the
invariable
reply
of
Mr
Toots
;
and
when
he
have
say
so
,
he
always
go
away
very
fast
.
  
<EOS>
now
it
be
certain
that
Mr
Toots
have
a
filmy
something
in
his
mind
,
which
lead
him
to
conclude
that
if
he
could
aspire
successfully
in
the
fulness
of
time
,
to
the
hand
of
Florence
,
he
would
be
fortunate
and
bl
.
<EOS>
It
be
certain
that
Mr
Toots
,
by
some
remote
and
roundabout
road
,
have
get
to
that
point
,
and
that
there
he
make
a
stand
.
<EOS>
His
heart
be
wound
;
he
be
touch
;
he
be
in
love
.
<EOS>
He
have
make
a
desperate
attempt
,
one
night
,
and
have
sit
up
all
night
for
the
purpose
,
to
write
an
acrostic
on
Florence
,
which
affect
him
to
tear
in
the
conception
.
<EOS>
but
he
never
proceed
in
the
execution
further
than
the
word
"
<EOS>
for
when
I
gaze
,
"
---
the
flow
of
imagination
in
which
he
have
previously
write
down
the
initial
letter
of
the
other
seven
line
,
desert
him
at
that
point
.
  
<EOS>
beyond
devise
that
very
artful
and
politic
measure
of
leave
a
card
for
Mr
Dombey
daily
,
the
brain
of
Mr
Toots
have
not
work
much
in
reference
to
the
subject
that
hold
his
feeling
prisoner
.
<EOS>
but
deep
consideration
at
length
assure
Mr
Toots
that
an
important
step
to
gain
,
be
,
the
conciliation
of
Miss
Susan
Nipper
,
preparatory
to
give
her
some
inkling
of
his
state
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
a
little
light
and
playful
gallantry
towards
this
lady
seem
the
mean
to
employ
in
that
early
chapter
of
the
history
,
for
win
her
to
his
interest
.
<EOS>
not
be
able
quite
to
make
up
his
mind
about
it
,
he
consult
the
Chicken
---
without
take
that
gentleman
into
his
confidence
;
merely
inform
him
that
a
friend
in
Yorkshire
have
write
to
him
(
Mr
Toots
)
for
his
opinion
on
such
a
question
.
<EOS>
the
Chicken
reply
that
his
opinion
always
be
,
"
go
in
and
win
,
"
and
further
,
"
when
your
man
be
before
you
and
your
work
cut
out
,
go
in
and
do
it
,
"
Mr
Toots
consider
this
a
figurative
way
of
support
his
own
view
of
the
case
,
and
heroically
resolve
to
kiss
Miss
Nipper
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
next
day
,
therefore
,
Mr
Toots
,
put
into
requisition
some
of
the
great
marvel
that
Burgess
and
Co.
have
ever
turn
out
,
go
off
to
Mr
Dombey
's
upon
this
design
.
<EOS>
but
his
heart
fail
him
so
much
as
he
approach
the
scene
of
action
,
that
,
although
he
arrive
on
the
ground
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
it
be
six
before
he
knock
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
everything
happen
as
usual
,
down
to
the
point
where
Susan
say
her
young
mistress
be
well
,
and
Mr
Toots
say
it
be
of
no
consequence
.
<EOS>
to
her
amazement
,
Mr
Toots
,
instead
of
go
off
like
a
rocket
,
after
that
observation
,
linger
and
chuckle
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
would
like
to
walk
up
stair
,
Sir
!
"
say
Susan
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
think
I
will
come
in
!
"
say
Mr
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
but
instead
of
walk
up
stair
,
the
bold
Toots
make
an
awkward
plunge
at
Susan
when
the
door
be
shut
,
and
embrace
that
fair
creature
,
kiss
her
on
the
cheek
.
  
<EOS>
"
go
along
with
you

"
<EOS>
cry
Susan
,
"
or
I
will
tear
your
eye
out

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
just
another

"
say
Mr
Toots
.
  
<EOS>
"
go

exclaim
Susan
,
give
him
a
push
.
<EOS>
"

innocent

you

<EOS>
who
will
begin
next
?
<EOS>
go
along

Sir

"
  
<EOS>
Susan
be
not
in
any
serious
strait
,
for
she
could
hardly
speak
for
laugh
;
but
Diogenes
,
on
the
staircase
,
hear
a
rustling
against
the
wall
,
and
a
shuffling
of
foot
,
and
see
through
the

that
there

form

dash

Susan
scream

open

run
down

Toots

stagger
out
into
the
street

with
Diogenes
hold
on
to
one
leg
of
his
pantaloon

as

Burgess

have
provide

dainty
morsel
for
his
holiday
entertainment
;
Diogenes
shake
off

roll
over

over
in

dust

get
up
again
,
whirl
round
the
giddy
Toots
and
snap
at
him
:
and
all
this
turmoil

Mr

rein
up

of

,
see

by

doubtful

closed
shutter
,
would
have
answer
well
enough
for
an
enchanted

<EOS>
such
as
the
tarnished
paw
of
gilded
lion
,
stealthily
put
out
from
beneath
their
wrapper
;
the
marble
lineament
of
bust

through

the

the

more
startling
than

-
bell
;
the
soften
sound
and
laggard
air
that

among

object
,
and
a
phantom
crowd
of

shroud
and
hooded

and
make
spectral

<EOS>
but
,
besides
,
there
be
the
great
staircase
,
where
the
lord
of
the
place
so
rarely
set
his
foot
,
and
by
which
his
little
child
have
go
up
to
Heaven
.
<EOS>
there
be
other
staircase
and
passage
where
no
one
go
for
week
together
;
there
be
two
closed
room
associate
with
dead
member
of
the
family
,
and
with
whisper
recollection
of
them
;
and
to
all
the
house
but
Florence
,
there
be
a
gentle
figure
move
through
the
solitude
and
gloom
,
that
give
to
every
lifeless
thing
a
touch
of
present
human
interest
and
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
for
Florence
live
alone
in
the
deserted
house
,
and
day
succeed
day
,
and
still
she
live
alone
,
and
the
cold
wall
look
down
upon
her
with
a
vacant
stare
,
as
if
they
have
a
Gorgon
-
like
mind
to
stare
her
youth
and
beauty
into
stone
.
  
<EOS>
the
grass
begin
to
grow
upon
the
roof
,
and
in
the
crevice
of
the
basement
paving
.
<EOS>
a
scaly
crumble
vegetation
sprout
round
the
window
-
sill
.
<EOS>
fragment
of
mortar
lose
their
hold
upon
the
inside
of
the
unused
chimney
,
and
come
drop
down
.
<EOS>
the
two
tree
with
the
smoky
trunk
be
blight
high
up
,
and
the
withered
branch
domineer
above
the
leave
.
<EOS>
through
the
whole
building
white
have
turn
yellow
,
yellow
nearly
black
;
and
since
the
time
when
the
poor
lady
die
,
it
have
slowly
become
a
dark
gap
in
the
long
monotonous
street
.
  
<EOS>
but
Florence
bloom
there
,
like
the
king
's
fair
daughter
in
the
story
.
<EOS>
Her
book
,
her
music
,
and
her
daily
teacher
,
be
<EOS>
her
only
real
companion
,
Susan
Nipper
and
Diogenes
except
:
of
whom
the
former
,
in
her
attendance
on
the
study
of
her
young
mistress
,
begin
to
grow
quite
learn
herself
,
while
the
latter
,
soften
possibly
by
the
same
influence
,
would
lay
his
head
upon
the
window
-
ledge
,
and
placidly
open
and
shut
his
eye
upon
the
street
,
all
through
a
summer
morning
;
sometimes
prick
up
his
head
to
look
with
great
significance
after
some
noisy
dog
in
a
cart
,
who
be
bark
his
way
along
,
and
sometimes
,
with
an
exasperated
and
unaccountable
recollection
of
his
suppose
enemy
in
the
neighbourhood
,
rush
to
the
door
,
whence
,
after
a
deafen
disturbance
,
he
would
come
jog
back
with
a
ridiculous
complacency
that
belong
to
him
,
and
lie
his
jaw
upon
the
window
-
ledge
again
,
with
the
air
of
a
dog
who
have
do
a
public
service
.
  
<EOS>
so
Florence
live
in
her
wilderness
of
a
home
,
within
the
circle
of
her
innocent
pursuit
and
thought
,
and
nothing
harm
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
go
down
to
her
father
's
room
now
,
and
think
of
him
,
and
suffer
her
love
heart
humbly
to
approach
him
,
without
fear
of
repulse
.
<EOS>
She
could
look
upon
the
object
that
have
surround
him
in
his
sorrow
,
and
could
nestle
near
his
chair
,
and
not
dread
the
glance
that
she
so
well
remember
.
<EOS>
She
could
render
him
such
little
token
of
her
duty
and
service
,
as
put
everything
in
order
for
him
with
her
own
hand
,
bind
little
nosegay
for
his
table
,
change
them
as
one
by
one
they
wither
,
and
he
do
not
come
back
,
prepare
something
for
him
every
day
,
and
leave
some
timid
mark
of
her
presence
near
his
usual
seat
.
<EOS>
to
-
day
,
it
be
a
little
paint
stand
for
his
watch
;
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
she
would
be
afraid
to
leave
it
,
and
would
substitute
some
other
trifle
of
her
make
not
so
likely
to
attract
his
eye
.
<EOS>
wake
in
the
night
,
perhaps
,
she
would
tremble
at
the
thought
of
his
come
home
and
angrily
reject
it
,
and
would
hurry
down
with
slippered
foot
and
quickly
beat
heart
,
and
bring
it
away
.
<EOS>
at
another
time
,
she
would
only
lay
her
face
upon
his
desk
,
and
leave
a
kiss
there
,
and
a
tear
.
  
<EOS>
still
no
one
know
of
this
.
<EOS>
unless
the
household
find
it
out
when
she
be
not
there
---
and
they
all
hold
Mr
Dombey
's
room
in
awe
---
it
be
as
deep
a
secret
in
her
breast
as
what
have
go
before
it
.
<EOS>
Florence
steal
into
those
room
at
twilight
,
early
in
the
morning
,
and
at
time
when
meal
be
serve
downstairs
.
<EOS>
and
although
they
be
in
every
nook
the
well
and
the
bright
for
her
care
,
she
enter
and
pass
out
as
quietly
as
any
sunbeam
,
except
that
she
leave
her
light
behind
.
  
<EOS>
shadowy
company
attend
Florence
up
and
down
the
echoing
house
,
and
sit
with
her
in
the
dismantle
room
.
<EOS>
as
if
her
life
be
an
enchanted
vision
,
there
arise
out
of
her
solitude
minister
thought
,
that
make
it
fanciful
and
unreal
.
<EOS>
She
imagine
so
often
what
her
life
would
have
be
if
her
father
could
have
love
her
<EOS>
and
she
have
be
a
favourite
child
,
<EOS>
that
sometimes
,
for
the
moment
,
she
almost
believe
it
be
so
,
and
,
bear
on
by
the
current
of
that
pensive
fiction
,
seem
to
remember
how
they
have
watch
her
brother
in
his
grave
together
;
how
they
have
freely
share
his
heart
between
them
;
how
they
be
unite
in
the
dear
remembrance
of
him
;
how
they
often
speak
about
him
yet
;
and
her
kind
father
,
look
at
her
gently
,
tell
her
of
their
common
hope
and
trust
in
God
.
<EOS>
at
other
time
she
picture
to
herself
her
mother
yet
alive
.
<EOS>
and
oh
the
happiness
of
fall
on
her
neck
,
and
cling
to
her
with
the
love
and
confidence
of
all
her
soul
!
<EOS>
and
oh
the
desolation
of
the
solitary
house
again
,
with
evening
come
on
,
and
no
one
there
!
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
one
thought
,
scarcely
shape
out
to
herself
,
yet
fervent
and
strong
within
her
,
that
uphold
Florence
when
she
strove
,
and
fill
her
true
young
heart
,
so
sorely
try
,
with
constancy
of
purpose
.
<EOS>
into
her
mind
,
as
into
all
other
contend
with
the
great
affliction
of
our
mortal
nature
,
there
have
steal
solemn
wondering
and
hope
,
arise
in
the
dim
world
beyond
the
present
life
,
and
murmuring
,
like
faint
music
,
of
recognition
in
the
far
-
off
land
between
her
brother
and
her
mother
:
of
some
present
consciousness
in
both
of
her
:
<EOS>
some
love
and
commiseration
for
her
:
and
some
knowledge
of
her
as
she
go
her
way
upon
the
earth
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
soothing
consolation
to
Florence
to
give
shelter
to
these
thought
,
until
one
day
<EOS>
---
it
be
soon
after
she
have
last
see
her
father
in
his
own
room
,
late
at
night
---
the
fancy
come
upon
her
,
that
,
in
weeping
for
his
alienated
heart
,
she
may
stir
the
spirit
of
the
dead
against
him
.
<EOS>
wild
,
weak
,
childish
,
as
it
may
have
be
to
think
so
,
and
to
tremble
at
the
half
-
form
thought
,
it
be
the
impulse
of
her
loving
nature
;
and
from
that
hour
Florence
strove
against
the
cruel
wound
in
her
breast
,
and
try
to
think
of
him
whose
hand
have
make
it
only
with
hope
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
do
not
know
---
she
hold
to
it
from
that
time
---
how
much
she
love
him
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
young
,
and
have
no
mother
,
and
have
never
learn
,
by
some
fault
or
misfortune
,
how
to
express
to
him
that
she
love
him
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
patient
,
and
would
try
to
gain
that
art
in
time
,
and
win
him
to
a
well
knowledge
of
his
only
child
.
  
<EOS>
this
become
the
purpose
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
the
morning
sun
shine
down
upon
the
fade
house
,
and
find
the
resolution
bright
and
fresh
within
the
bosom
of
its
solitary
mistress
.
<EOS>
through
all
the
duty
of
the
day
,
it
animate
her
;
for
Florence
hope
that
the
more
she
know
,
and
the
more
accomplish
she
become
,
the
more
glad
he
would
be
when
he
come
to
know
and
like
her
.
<EOS>
sometimes
she
wonder
,
with
a
swell
heart
and
rise
tear
,
whether
she
be
proficient
enough
in
anything
to
surprise
him
when
they
should
become
companion
.
<EOS>
sometimes
she
try
to
think
if
there
be
any
kind
of
knowledge
that
would
bespeak
his
interest
more
readily
than
another
.
<EOS>
always
:
at
her
book
,
her
music
,
and
her
work
:
in
her
morning
walk
,
and
in
her
nightly
prayer
:
she
have
her
engross
aim
in
view
.
<EOS>
strange
study
for
a
child
,
to
learn
the
road
to
a
hard
parent
's
heart
!
  
<EOS>
there
be
many
careless
lounger
through
the
street
,
as
the
summer
evening
deepen
into
night
,
who
glance
across
the
road
at
the
sombre
house
,
and
see
the
youthful
figure
at
the
window
,
such
a
contrast
to
it
,
look
upward
at
the
star
as
they
begin
to
shine
,
who
would
have
sleep
the
bad
if
they
have
know
on
what
design
she
muse
so
steadfastly
.
<EOS>
the
reputation
of
the
mansion
as
a
haunt
house
,
would
not
have
be
the
gayer
with
some
humble
dweller
elsewhere
,
who
be
strike
by
its
external
gloom
in
pass
and
repasse
on
their
daily
avocation
,
and
so
name
it
,
if
they
could
have
read
its
story
in
the
darkening
face
.
<EOS>
but
Florence
hold
her
sacred
purpose
,
unsuspected
and
unaided
:
and
study
only
how
to
bring
her
father
to
the
understanding
that
she
love
him
,
and
make
no
appeal
against
him
in
any
wander
thought
.
  
<EOS>
thus
Florence
live
alone
in
the
deserted
house
,
and
day
succeed
day
,
and
still
she
live
alone
,
and
the
monotonous
wall
look
down
upon
her
with
a
stare
,
as
if
they
have
a
Gorgon
-
like
intent
to
stare
her
youth
and
beauty
into
stone
.
  
<EOS>
Susan
Nipper
stand
opposite
to
her
young
mistress
one
morning
,
as
she
fold
and
seal
a
note
she
have
be
write
:
and
show
in
her
look
an
approve
knowledge
of
its
content
.
  
<EOS>
"
better
late
than
never
,
dear
Miss
Floy
,
"
say
Susan
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
do
say
,
that
even
a
visit
to
them
old
skettlese
will
be
a
God
-
send
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
good
of
Sir
Barnet
and
Lady
Skettles
,
Susan
,
"
return
Florence
,
with
a
mild
correction
of
that
young
lady
's
familiar
mention
of
the
family
in
question
,
"
to
repeat
their
invitation
so
kindly
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Nipper
,
who
be
perhaps
the
most
thoroughgoing
partisan
on
the
face
of
the
earth
,
and
who
carry
her
partisanship
into
all
matter
great
or
small
,
and
perpetually
wage
war
with
it
against
society
,
screw
up
her
lip
and
shake
her
head
,
as
a
protest
against
any
recognition
of
disinterestedness
in
the
Skettleses
,
and
a
plea
in
bar
that
they
would
have
valuable
consideration
for
their
kindness
,
in
the
company
of
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
know
what
they
be
about
,
if
ever
people
do
,
"
murmur
Miss
Nipper
,
draw
in
her
breath
,
"
oh
!
trust
them
skettlese
for
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
very
anxious
to
go
to
Fulham
,
Susan
,
I
confess
,
"
say
Florence
thoughtfully
:
"
<EOS>
but
it
will
be
right
to
go
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
will
be
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
much
well
,
"
interpose
Susan
,
with
another
emphatic
shake
of
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
,
"
say
Florence
,
"
though
I
would
prefer
to
have
go
when
there
be
no
one
there
,
instead
of
in
this
vacation
time
,
when
it
seem
there
be
some
young
people
stay
in
the
house

,
I
have
thankfully

yes

"
for
which
I
say
,
<EOS>
Miss

oh
be
joyful

return
Susan
.
"
<EOS>
ah

"
  
<EOS>
this
last
ejaculation
,
with
which
Miss
Nipper
frequently
wind
up
a
sentence
,
at
about
that
epoch
of
time
,
be
suppose
below
the
level
of
the
hall
to
have
a
general
reference
to
Mr
Dombey
,
and
to
be
expressive
of
a
yearning
in
Miss
Nipper
to
favour
that
gentleman
with
a
piece
of
her
mind
.
<EOS>
but
she
never
explain
it
;
and
it
have
,
in
consequence
,
the
charm
of
mystery
,
in
addition
to
the
advantage
of
the
sharp
expression
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
long
it
be
before
we
have
any
news
of
Walter
,
Susan
!
"
<EOS>
observe
Florence
,
after
a
moment
's
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
long
indeed
,
Miss
Floy
!
"
reply
her
maid
.
"
<EOS>
and
Perch
say
,
when
he
come
just
now
to
see
for
letter

what

off

rarely
succumb

twelve
o'clock
next
night

<EOS>
the
chief
object
of
this
institution
appear
to
be

that
Mrs

should
move
all
the
furniture
into

back
garden
at
early
dawn
,
walk
about
the
house
in
pattens
all
day

these

greatly
flutter

find
any
rest

place
for
the
sol

foot

generally

a
good
deal
of
peck
from

maternal
bird

solemnity

<EOS>
at
the
moment

Alexander

a

the
feeling

be
outrage

the
look

Alexander

therefore

Mrs

to
keep
a
house

do
not
deserve
to
have
a

my
house

and
when
I
let
the
upper
floor

a
thankless
thing

and
cast
pearl

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
MacStinger
pitch
her
voice
for
the
upper
window
in
offer
these
remark
,
and
crack
off
each
clause
sharply
by
itself
as
if
from
a
rifle

an
infinity
of
barrel
.
<EOS>
after
the
last
shot
,
the
Captain
's
voice
be
hear
to
say
,
in
feeble
remonstrance
from
his
own
room
,
"
steady
below
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
since
you
want
Cap'en
Cuttle
,
there

"
say
Mrs
MacStinger
,
with
an
angry
motion
of
her
hand
.
<EOS>
on
Florence
make
bold
to
enter
,
without
any
more
parley
,
and
on
Susan
follow
,
Mrs
MacStinger
recommence
her
pedestrian
exercise
in
patten
,
and
Alexander
MacStinger
(
still
on
the
pave
-
stone
)
,
who
have
stop
in
his
crying
to
attend
to
the
conversation
,
begin
to
wail
again
,
entertain
himself
during
that
dismal
performance
,
which
be
quite
mechanical
,
with
a
general
survey
of
the
prospect
,
terminate
in
the
hackney
-
coach
.
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
in
his
own
apartment
be
sit
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
his
leg
draw
up
under
his
chair
,
on
a
very
small
desolate
island
,
lie
about
midway
in
an
ocean
of
soap
and
water
.
<EOS>
the
Captain
's
window
have
be
clean
,
the
wall
have
be
clean
,
the
stove
have
be
clean
,
and
everything
,
the
stove
except
,
be
wet
,
and
shine
with
soft
soap
and
sand
:
the
smell
of
which
dry
-
saltery
impregnate
the
air
.
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
the
dreary
scene
,
the
Captain
,
cast
away
upon
his
island
,
look
round
on
the
waste
of
water
with
a
rueful
countenance
,
and
seem
wait
for
some
friendly
bark
to
come
that
way
,
and
take
him
off
.
   
<EOS>
but
when
the
Captain
,
direct
his
forlorn
visage
towards
the
door
,
see
Florence
appear
with
her
maid
,
no
word
can
describe
his
astonishment
.
<EOS>
Mrs
MacStinger
's
eloquence
have
render
all
other
sound
but
imperfectly
distinguishable
,
he
have
look
for
no
rarer
visitor
than
the
potboy
or
the
milkman
;
wherefore
,
when
Florence
appear
,
and
come
to
the
confine
of
the
island
,
put
her
hand
in
his
,
the
Captain
stand
up
,
aghast
,
as
if
he
suppose
her
,
for
the
moment
,
to
be
some
young
member
of
the
Flying
Dutchman
's
family
.
  
<EOS>
instantly
recover
his
self
-
possession
,
however
,
the
Captain
's
first
care
be
to
place
her
on
dry
land
,
which
he
happily
accomplish
,
with
one
motion
of
his
arm
.
<EOS>
issue
forth
,
then
,
upon
the
main
,
Captain
Cuttle
take
Miss
Nipper
round
the
waist
,
and
bear
her
to
the
island
also
.
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
then
,
with
great
respect
and
admiration
,
raise
the
hand
of
Florence
to
his
lip
,
and
stand
off
a
little
(
for
the
island
be
not
large
enough
for
three
)
,
beam
on
her
from
the
soap
and
water
like
a
new
description
of
Triton
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
amazed
to
see
us
,
I
be
sure

Florence
,
with
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
the
inexpressibly
gratify
Captain

his
hook
in
reply
,
and
growl
,
as
if
a
choice
and
delicate
compliment
be
include
in
the
word
,
"

"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
could
not

Florence
,
"
without

"
  
<EOS>
at
these
word
Captain
Cuttle

by
an
involuntary
gesture
,
clap
his
hand
to
his
head

on

discomfited

inquire
Florence
,
from
whose
face
the
Captain

so
enraptured
he
be
with
it

his
eye

while
she
,
in
her
turn
,
look
earnestly
at
him

the
sincerity

raise
to
announce
a
beautiful
quotation

Florence

Will

on

look
discomfited

<EOS>
but
at
this
instant
a
most
remarkable
phenomenon
occur
.
<EOS>
the
door
opening
,
without
any
note
of
preparation
,
and
apparently
of
itself
,
the
hard
glaze
hat
in
question
skim
into
the
room
like
a
bird
,
and
alight
heavily
at
the
Captain

foot
.
<EOS>
the
door
then
shut
as
violently
as
it

open

and
nothing

the
prodigy

<EOS>
Captain

pick
up
his
hat
,

have
turn
it
over
with
a
look
of
interest
and
welcome
,
begin
to
polish
it
on
his
sleeve
.
<EOS>
while
do
so
,
the
Captain
eye
his
visitor
intently
,
and
say
in
a
low
voice
:
  
"
<EOS>
You
see
I

ask
Susan

the
lady
of
the
house

my

"
return
the
Captain
,
in
a
gruff
whisper
,
and
make
signal
of
secrecy
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
some
word
about
the
swabbing
of

plank
,
and

in
short
,

with
the
energy

I
would
stop
her

<EOS>
"
Would
you

rejoin
the
Captain
,
shake
his
head
doubtfully
,
but
regard
the
desperate
courage
of
the
fair
aspirant
with
obvious
admiration
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

<EOS>
It
be
difficult

She

one
minute

round

and
when
she
be
a
tartar

"
say
the
Captain
,
with
the
perspiration
break
out
upon
his
forehead
---
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
but
a
whistle
emphatic
enough
for
the
conclusion
of
the
sentence
,
so
the
Captain
whistle
tremulously
.
<EOS>
after
which
he
again
shake
his
head
,
and
recur
to
his
admiration
of
Miss
Nipper
's
devoted
bravery
,
timidly
repeat
,
"
Would
you
,
do
you
think

my

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Susan
only
reply
with
a
bridling
smile
,
but
that
be
so
very
full
of
defiance
,
that
there
be
no
know
how
long
Captain
Cuttle
may
have
stand
entrance
in
its
contemplation
,
if
Florence
in
her
anxiety
have
not
again
propose
their
immediately
resort
to
the
oracular
Bunsby
.
<EOS>
thus
remind
of
his
duty
,
Captain
Cuttle
put
on
the
glaze
hat
firmly
,
take
up
another
knobby
stick
,
with
which
he
have
supply
the
place
of
that
one
give
to
Walter
,
and
offer
his
arm
to
Florence
,
prepare
to
cut
his
way
through
the
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
It
turn
out
,
however
,
that
Mrs
MacStinger
have
already
change
her
course
,
and
that
she
head
,
as
the
Captain
have
remark
she
often
do
,
in
quite
a
new
direction
.
<EOS>
for
when
they
get
downstairs
,
they
find
that
exemplary
woman
beat
the
mat
on
the
doorstep
,
with
Alexander
,
still
upon
the
paving
-
stone
,
dimly
loom
through
a
fog
of
dust
;
and
so
absorb
be
Mrs
MacStinger
in
her
household
occupation
,
that
when
Captain
Cuttle
and
his
visitor
pass
,
she
beat
the
harder
,
and
neither
by
word
nor
gesture
show
any
consciousness
of
their
vicinity
.
<EOS>
the
Captain
be
so
well
pleased
with
this
easy
escape
---
although
the
effect
of
the
door
-
mat
on
him
be
like
a
copious
administration
of
snuff
,
and
make
him
sneeze
until
the
tear
run
down
his
face
---
that
he
could
hardly
believe
his
good
fortune
;
but
more
than
once
,
between
the
door
and
the
hackney
-
coach
,
look
over
his
shoulder
,
with
an
obvious
apprehension
of
Mrs
MacStinger
's
give
chase
yet
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
they
get
to
the
corner
of
Brig
Place
without
any
molestation
from
that
terrible
fire
-
ship
;
and
the
Captain
mount
the
coach
-
box
---
for
his
gallantry
would
not
allow
him
to
ride
inside
with
the
lady
,
though
besought
to
do
so

pilot

driver
on
his
course
for
Captain
Bunsby

vessel

which

Cautious
Clara

and

hard
by
Ratcliffe

<EOS>
arrive
at
the
wharf
off
which
this
great
commander
's
ship
be
jam
in
among
some
five
hundred
companion
,
whose
tangle
rigging
look
like
monstrous
cobwebs
half
sweep
down
,
Captain
Cuttle
appear
at
the
coach
-
window
,
and
invite
Florence
and
Miss
Nipper
to
accompany
him
on
board
;
observe
that
Bunsby
be
to
the
last
degree
soft
-
hearted
in
respect
of
lady
,
and
that
nothing
would
so
much
tend
to
bring
his
expansive
intellect
into
a
state
of
harmony
as
their
presentation
to
the
Cautious
Clara
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
readily
consent
;
and
the
Captain
,
take
her
little
hand
in
his
prodigious
palm
,
lead
her
,
with
a
mixed
expression
of
patronage
,
paternity
,
pride
,
and
ceremony
,
that
be
pleasant
to
see
,
over
several
very
dirty
deck
,
until
,
come
to
the
Clara
,
they
find
that
cautious
craft
(
which
lie
outside
the
tier
)
with
her
gangway
remove
,
and
half

It

aside

to

in

accompany
him
below

where

that

often
peep
in
at

testify
his

in

Florence

immediately

it

have
be
difficult
to

that
there

contradictory

once

wildly

SIR
BARNET
and
Lady
Skettles
,
very
good
people
,
reside
in
a
pretty
villa
at
Fulham
,
on
the
bank
of
the
Thames
;
which
be
one
of
the
most
desirable
residence
in
the
world
when
a
rowing
-
match
happen
to
be
go
past
,
but
have
its
little
inconvenience
at
other
time
,
among
which
may
be
enumerate
the
occasional
appearance
of
the
river
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
the
contemporaneous
disappearance
of
the
lawn
and
shrubbery
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Barnett
Skettles
express
his
personal
consequence
chiefly
through
an
antique
gold
snuff
-
box
,
and
a
ponderous
silk
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
which
he
have
an
impose
manner
of
draw
out
of
his
pocket
like
a
banner
,
and
use
with
both
hand
at
once
.
<EOS>
Sir
Barnet
's
object
in
life
be
constantly
to
extend
the
range
of
his
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
like
a
heavy
body
drop
into
water
---
not
to
disparage
so
worthy
a
gentleman
by
the
comparison
<EOS>
---
it
be
in
the
nature
of
thing
that
Sir
Barnet
must
spread
an
ever
-
widen
circle
about
him
,
until
there
be
no
room
leave
.
<EOS>
or
,
like
a
sound
in
air
,
the
vibration
of
which
,
accord
to
the
speculation
of
an
ingenious
modern
philosopher
,
may
go
on
travel
for
ever
through
the
interminable
field
of
space
,
nothing
but
come
to
the
end
of
his
moral
tether
could
stop
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
in
his
voyage
of
discovery
through
the
social
system
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Barnet
be
proud
of
make
people
acquaint
with
people
.
<EOS>
He
like
the
thing
for
its
own
sake
,
and
it
advance
his
favourite
object
too
.
<EOS>
for
example
,
if
Sir
Barnet
have
the
good
fortune
to
get
hold
of
a
raw
recruit
,
or
a
country
gentleman
,
and
ensnare
him
to
his
hospitable
villa
,
Sir
Barnet
would
say
to
him
,
on
the
morning
after
his
arrival
,
"

my

or
in
anything
of
that
sort
?
"
<EOS>
possibly
the
patient
answer
yes
,
and
mention
somebody
,
of
whom
Sir
Barnet
have
no
more
personal
knowledge
than
of
Ptolemy
the
Great
.
<EOS>
Sir
Barnet
reply
,
that
nothing
on
earth
be
easy
,
as
he
know
him
very
well
:
immediately
call
on
the
aforesaid
somebody
,
leave
his
card
,
write
a
short
note
,
---
<EOS>
"
My
dear
sir

penalty
of
your
eminent
position

my

and
so
kill
a
brace
of
bird
with
one
stone
,
dead
as

.
  
<EOS>
with
the
snuff
-
box
and
banner
in
full
force
,
Sir
Barnet
Skettles
propound
his
usual
inquiry
to
Florence
on
the
first
morning
of
her
visit
.
<EOS>
when
Florence
thank
him
,
and
say
there
be
no
one
in
particular
whom
she
desire
to
see
<EOS>
,
it
be
natural
she
should
think
with
a
pang

of

<EOS>
when
Sir

Skettles
,
urge
his

,
"

Lady
Skettles
when
you

may
wish

<EOS>
"
it
be
natural
,
perhaps
,
that
her
poor
head
should
droop
a
little
,
and
that
her
voice
should
tremble
as
it
softly
answer
in
the
negative

<EOS>
Skettles

and
sober

and
appear
to
feel

aggrieve
by
the
solicitude
of
his
excellent
mother
that
he
should
be
attentive
to
Florence
.
<EOS>
another
and
a
deep
injury
under

Mrs

reply

with
a
sweet
smile

a
shake
of
her
sky

blue
cap
,
that
if
Sir
Barnet
could
have
make
her
know
to
Cicero
,
she
would
have
trouble
him
;
but
such
an
introduction
not
be
feasible

and
she
already
enjoy
the
friendship
of
himself
and
his
amiable
lady
,
and
possess
with
the
doctor

husband
their
joint

<EOS>
Sir
Barnet
be

under
these
circumstance
,
to
content
himself
for
the
time
with
the
company
assemble
.
<EOS>
Florence
be
glad
of
that
;
for
she
have
a
study
to
pursue
among
them
,
and
it
lie
too
near
her
heart
,
and
be
too
precious
and
momentous
,
to
yield
to
any
other
interest
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
some
child
stay
in
the
house

<EOS>
child
who
be
as
frank

happy
with

with

as
those
rosy

<EOS>
child
who
have
no
restraint
upon
their
love

freely
show
it

<EOS>
Florence
seek
to
learn
their
secret
;
seek
to
find
out
what
it
be
she
have
miss
;
what
simple
art
they
know
,
and
she
know
not
;
how
she
could
be
teach
by
them
to
show
her
father
that
she
love
him
,
and
to
win
his
love
again
.
  
<EOS>
many
a
day
do
Florence
thoughtfully
observe
these
child
.
<EOS>
on
many
a
bright
morning
do
she
leave
her
bed
when
the
glorious
sun
rise
,
and
walk
up
and
down
upon
the
river
's
bank
,
before
any
one
in
the
house
be
stir
,
look
up
at
the
window
of
their
room
,
and
think
of
them
,
asleep
,
so
gently
tended
and
affectionately
think
of
.
<EOS>
Florence
would
feel
more
lonely
then
,
than
in
the
great
house
all
alone
;
and
would
think
sometimes
that
she
be
well
there
than
here
,
and
that
there
be
great
peace
in
hide
herself
than
in
mingle
with
other
of
her
age
,
and
find
how
unlike
them
all
she
be
.
<EOS>
but
attentive
to
her
study
,
though
it
touch
her
to
the
quick
at
every
little
leaf
she
turn
in
the
hard
book
,
Florence
remain
among
them
,
and
try
with
patient
hope
,
to
gain
the
knowledge
that
she
weary
for
.
  
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
how
to
gain
it
!
<EOS>
how
to
know
the
charm
in
its
beginning!there
be
daughter
here
,
who
rise
up
in
the
morning
,
and
lie
down
to
rest
at
night
,
possess
of
father
'
heart
already
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
repulse
to
overcome
,
no
coldness
to
dread
,
no
frown
to
smooth
away
.
<EOS>
as
the
morning
advance
,
and
the
window
open
one
by
one
,
and
the
dew
begin
to
dry
upon
the
flower
and
grass
,
and
youthful
foot
begin
to
move
upon
the
lawn
,
Florence
,
glance
round
at
the
bright
face
,
think
what
be
there
she
could
learn
from
these
child
?
<EOS>
It
be
too
late
to
learn
from
them
;
each
could
approach
her
father
fearlessly
,
and
put
up
her
lip
to
meet
the
ready
kiss
,
and
wind
her
arm
about
the
neck
that
bend
down
to
caress
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
begin
by
be
so
bold
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
could
it
be
that
there
be
less
and
less
hope
as
she
study
more
and
more
!
  
<EOS>
She
remember
well
,
that
even
the
old
woman
who
have
rob
her
when
a
little
child
---
whose
image
and
whose
house
,
and
all
she
have
say
and
do
,
be
stamp
upon
her
recollection
,
with
the
endure
sharpness
of
a
fearful
impression
make
at
that
early
period
of
life
---
have
speak
fondly
of
her
daughter
,
and
how
terribly
even
she
have
cry
out
in
the
pain
of
hopeless
separation
from
her
child
.
<EOS>
but
her
own
mother
,
she
would
think
again
,
when
she
recall
this
,
have
love
her
well
.
<EOS>
then
,
sometimes
,
when
her
thought
revert
swiftly
to
the
void
between
herself
and
her
father
,
Florence
would
tremble
,
and
the
tear
would
start
upon
her
face
,
as
she
picture
to
herself
her
mother
live
on
,
and
come
also
to
dislike
her

because
of
her

the
unknown
grace
that
should
conciliate
that
father
naturally

<EOS>
She
know
that
this

do
wrong
to
her
mother

memory

have
no

yet
she
try
so
hard
to
justify
him
,
and
to
find
the
whole
blame
in
herself
,
that
she
could
not
resist
its
passing
,
like
a
wild
cloud
,
through
the
distance
of
her
mind

<EOS>
there
come

and
wreathe
flower

the
head
of
one
little
creature
among
them
who

plaything
of
the

,
hear
this
same
lady

the
little

<EOS>
as
they
stop
soon
afterwards
to
watch
some
boat
,
and
have
be
silent
in
the
meantime
,
Florence

who
have
rise
when

and
have
gather

after
a
moment

pause
,
that
she

<EOS>
Her
tone
of
voice
arrest
Florence
,
who
have
start
from
her
seat
again
;
and
hold
her

the
flower

Florence
hold
to
her
breast
begin
to
fall
when
she
hear
those
word
,
so
wonderingly
spoken
.
<EOS>
She
hold
them
closer
;

her
face
hang
down
upon
them

<EOS>
"
Kate

the
lady
,
after
another
moment
of
silence
,
"
I
will
tell

the
whole

I

tell
no

the

"
I
can
trust

I
fear
then

Kate

that
Florence

father
care
little
for
her

very
seldom
see
her
,
never
be
kind

now
quite
shun
her

avoid
her

<EOS>
She
would
love
him
dearly
if
he
would
suffer
her
,
but
he
will
not

though
for
no
fault
of
hers

she
be
greatly
to

love

pity
by
all
gentle
heart

<EOS>
More
of
the
flower
that
Florence
hold
,
fall
scatter
on
the
ground
;
those
that
remain
be
wet
,
but
not
with
dew

and
her
face
drop
upon
her
laden
hand

"
poor
Florence

cry
the

do

a
pleasant

for
every

ready
to
oblige
us
all

why
her

More

"
My

whose

light

so
desert
as
the
child

be
an
outcast
from
a

parent
's
love

<EOS>
the
flower
be
scatter
on
the
ground
like
dust
;
the
empty
hand
be
spread
upon
the
face
;
and
orphan
Florence
,
shrink
down
upon
the
ground
,
weep
long
and
bitterly
.
  
<EOS>
but
true
of
heart
and
resolute
in
her
good
purpose
,
Florence
hold
to
it
as
her
die
mother
hold
by
her
upon
the
day
that
give
Paul
life
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
how
much
she
love
him
.
<EOS>
however
long
the
time
in
come
,
and
however
slow
the
interval
,
she
must
try
to
bring
that
knowledge
to
her
father
's
heart
one
day
or
other
.
<EOS>
meantime
she
must
be
careful
in
no
thoughtless
word
,
or
look
,
or
burst
of
feeling
awaken
by
any
chance
circumstance
,
to
complain
against
him
,
or
to
give
occasion
for
these
whisper
to
his
prejudice
.
  
<EOS>
even
in
the
response
she
make
the
orphan
child
,
to
whom
she
be
attract
strongly
,
and
whom
she
have
such
occasion
to
remember
,
Florence
be
mindful
of
him
.
<EOS>
if
she
single
her
out
too
plainly
(
Florence
think
)
from
among
the
rest
,
she
would
confirm
---
in
one
mind
certainly
:
perhaps
in
more
---
the
belief
that
he
be
cruel
and
unnatural
.
<EOS>
Her
own
delight
be
no
set
-
off
to
this
.
<EOS>
what
she
have
overhear
be
a
reason
,
not
for
soothe
herself
,
but
for
save
him
;
and
Florence
do
it
,
in
pursuance
of
the
study
of
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
She
do
so
always
.
<EOS>
if
a
book
be
read
aloud
,
and
there
be
anything
in
the
story
that
point
at
an
unkind
father
,
she
be
in
pain
for
their
application
of
it
to
him
;
not
for
herself
.
<EOS>
so
with
any
trifle

an
interlude
that
be
act
,
or
picture
that
be
show
,
or
game
that
be
play

among
them
.
<EOS>
the
occasion
for
such
tenderness
towards
him
be
so
many
,
that
her
mind
misgave
her
often
,
it
would
indeed
be
well
to
go
back
to
the
old
house
,
and
live
again
within
the
shadow
of
its
dull
wall
,
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
how
few
who
see
sweet
Florence
,
in
her
spring
of
womanhood
,
the
modest
little
queen
of
those
small
revel
,
imagine
what
a
load
of
sacred
care
lie
heavy
in
her
breast
!
<EOS>
how
few
of
those
who
stiffen
in
her
father
's
freezing
atmosphere
,
suspect
what
a
heap
of
fiery
coal
be
pile
upon
his
head
!
  
<EOS>
Florence
pursue
her
study
patiently
,
and
,
fail
to
acquire
the
secret
of
the
nameless
grace
she
seek
,
among
the
youthful
company
who
be
assemble
in
the
house
,
often
walk
out
alone
,
in
the
early
morning
,
among
the
child
of
the
poor
.
<EOS>
but
still
she
find
them
all
too
far
advanced
to
learn
from
.
<EOS>
They
have
win
their
household
place
long
ago
,
and
do
not
stand
without
,
as
she
do
,
with
a
bar
across
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
one
man
whom
she
several
time
observe
at
work
very
early
,
and
often
with
a
girl
of
about
her
own
age
seat
near
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
very
poor
man
,
who
seem
to
have
no
regular
employment
,
but
now
go
roam
about
the
bank
of
the
river
when
the
tide
be
low
,
look
out
for
bit
and
scrap
in
the
mud
;
and
now
work
at
the
unpromising
little
patch
of
garden
-
ground
before
his
cottage
;
and
now
tinker
up
a
miserable
old
boat
that
belong
to
him
;
or
do
some
job
of
that
kind
for
a
neighbour
,
as
chance
occur
.
<EOS>
whatever
the
man
's
labour
,
the
girl
be
never
employ
;
but
sit
,
when
she
be
with
him
,
in
a
listless
,
mope
state
,
and
idle
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
have
often
wish
to
speak
to
this
man
;
yet
she
have
never
take
courage
to
do
so
,
as
he
make
no
movement
towards
her
.
<EOS>
but
one
morning
when
she
happen
to
come
upon
him
suddenly
,
from
a
by
-
path
among
some
pollard
willow
which
terminate
in
the
little
shelve
piece
of
stony
ground
that
lie
between
his
dwelling
and
the
water
,
where
he
be
bend
over
a
fire
he
have
make
to
caulk
the
old
boat
which
be
lie
bottom
upwards
,
close
by
<EOS>
,
he
raise
his
head
at
the
sound
of
her
footstep
,
and
give
her
good
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
morning
,
"
say
Florence
,
approach
nearer
,
"
you
be
at
work
early

glad

"
  
<EOS>
"
be

so
hard
to
get

"
ask
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I

it
so

the
man
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
glance
to
where
the

,
draw
together
,
with
her
elbow
on
her
knee
,
and
her
chin
on
her
hand
,
and
say
:
  
"

"
  
<EOS>
He
raise
his
head
quickly
,
and
look
towards
the
girl
with
a
brightened
face
,
nod
to
her
,
and
say
"
yes
.
"
<EOS>
Florence
look
towards
her
too
,
and
give
her
a
kind
salutation
;
the
girl
mutter
something
in
return
,
ungraciously
and
sullenly
.
  
<EOS>

be
she
in
want
of

"
  
<EOS>
Florence
softly
put
some
money
near
his
hand
on
the
old
boat
,
and
leave
him
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
Florence
begin
to
think
,
<EOS>
if
she
be
to
fall
ill
,
if
she
be
to
fade
like
her
dear
brother
,
would
he
then
know
that
she
have
love
him
;
would
she
then
grow
dear
to
him
;
would
he
come
to
her
bedside
,
when
she
be
weak
and
dim
of
sight
,
and
take
her
into
his
embrace
,
and
cancel
all
the
past
?
<EOS>
Would
he
so
forgive
her
,
in
that
change
condition
,
for
not
have
be
able
to
lay
open
her
childish
heart
to
him
,
as
to
make
it
easy
to
relate
with
what
emotion
she
have
go
out
of
his
room
that
night
;
what
she
have
mean
to
say
if
she
have
have
the
courage
;
and
how
she
have
endeavour
,
afterwards
,
to
learn
the
way
she
never
know
in
infancy
?
  
<EOS>
yes
,
she
think
if
she
be
die
,
he
would
relent
.
<EOS>
She
think
,
that
if
she
lie
,
serene
and
not
unwilling
to
depart
,
upon
the
bed
that
be
curtain
round
with
recollection
of
their
darling
boy
,
he
would
be
touch
home
,
and
would
say
,
"
Dear
Florence
,
live
for
me
,
and
we
will
love
each
other
as
we
may
have
do
,
and
be
as
happy
as
we
may
have
be
these
many
year
!
"
<EOS>
She
think
that
if
she
hear
such
word
from
him
,
and
have
her
arm
clasp
round
him
,
she
could
answer
with
a
smile
,
"
It
be
too
late
for
anything
but
this
;
I
never
could
be
happy
,
dear
father
!
"
<EOS>
and
so
leave
him
,
with
a
blessing
on
her
lip
.
  
<EOS>
the
golden
water
she
remember
on
the
wall
,
appear
to
Florence
,
in
the
light
of
such
reflection
,
only
as
a
current
flow
on
to
rest
,
and
to
a
region
where
the
dear
one
,
go
before
,
be
wait
,
hand
in
hand
;
and
often
when
she
look
upon
the
darker
river
ripple
at
her
foot
,
she
think
with
awful
wonder
,
but
not
terror
,
of
that
river
which
her
brother
have
so
often
say
be
bear
him
away
.
  
<EOS>
the
father
and
his
sick
daughter
be
yet
fresh
in
Florence
's
mind
,
and
,
indeed
,
that
incident
be
not
a
week
old
,
when
Sir
Barnet
and
his
lady
go
out
walk
in
the
lane
one
afternoon
,
propose
to
her
to
bear
them
company
.
<EOS>
Florence
readily
consent
,
Lady
Skettles
order
out
young
Barnet
as
a
matter
of

.
<EOS>
for
nothing
delighted
Lady
Skettles
so
much
,
as
behold
her
eld
son
with
Florence
on
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
Barnet
,
to
say
the
truth
,
appear
to
entertain
an
opposite
sentiment
on
the
subject
,
and
on
such
occasion
frequently
express
himself
audibly
,
though
indefinitely
,
in
reference
to
"
a
parcel
of
girl
.
<EOS>
"
as
it
be
not
easy
to
ruffle
her
sweet
temper
,
however
,
Florence
generally
reconcile
the
young
gentleman
to
his
fate
after
a
few
minute
,
and
they
stroll
on
amicably
:
Lady
Skettles
and
Sir
Barnet
<EOS>
follow
,
in
a
state
of
perfect
complacency
and
high
gratification
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
order
of
procedure
on
the
afternoon
in
question
:
and
Florence
have
almost
succeed
in
overrule
the
present
objection
of
Skettles
Junior
to
his
destiny
,
when
a
gentleman
on
horseback
come
ride
by
,
look
at
them
earnestly
as
he
pass
,
draw
in
his
rein
,
wheeled

an

back
again
,
hat
in

<EOS>
the
gentleman
have
look
particularly
at
Florence
;
and
when
the
little
party
stop
,
on
his
riding
back
,
he
bow
to
her
,
before
salute
Sir
Barnet
and
his
lady
.
<EOS>
Florence
have
no
remembrance
of
have
ever
see
him
,
but
she
start
involuntarily
when
he
come
near
her
,
and
draw
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
horse
be
perfectly
quiet
,
I
assure
you
,
"
say
the
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
,
but
something
in
the
gentleman
himself
---
Florence
could
not
have
say
what
---
that
make
her
recoil
as
if
she
have
be

<EOS>
"
I
have
the

most
persuasive

he
add
,
"
My

present
him
to

hostess
;
by
whom

"
I
beg
pardon

Mr

"
a
thousand
time

<EOS>
but
I
be
go
down
to

morrow
morning
to
Mr

at
Leamington

and
if
Miss

I

"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Barnet
immediately
divine
that
Florence
would
desire
to
write
a
letter
to
her
father
,
propose
to
return
,
and
besought
Mr
Carker
to
come
home
and
dine
in
his
ride
gear
.
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
have
the
misfortune
to
be
engage
to
dinner
,
but
if
Miss
Dombey
wish
to
write
,
nothing
would
delight
him
more
than
to
accompany
them
back
,
and
to
be
her
faithful
slave
in
wait
as
long
as
she
please
.
<EOS>
as
he
say
this
with
his
wide
smile
,
and
bend
down
close
to
her
to
pat
his
horse
's
neck
,
Florence
meet
his
eye
,
see
,
rather
than
hear
him
say
,
"
there
be
no
news
of
the
ship
!
"
  
<EOS>
confused
,
frightened
,
shrink
from
him
,
and
not
even
sure
that
he
have
say
those
word
<EOS>
,
for
he
seem
to
have
show
them
to
her
in
some
extraordinary
manner
through
his
smile
,
instead
of
utter
them
,
Florence
faintly
say
that
she
be
oblige
to
him
,
but
she
would
not
write
;
she
have
nothing
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
to

Miss
Dombey

say
the
man
of

<EOS>
"
nothing

say
Florence
,
"
but
my
---
but
my
dear
love

if
you
please

"
  
<EOS>
Disturbed
as
Florence
be
,
she
raise
her
eye
to
his
face
with
an
imploring
and
expressive
look
,
that
plainly
beseech
him
,
if
he
know
---
which
he
as
plainly
do
---
that
any
message
between
her
and
her
father
be
an
uncommon
charge
,
but
that
one
most
of
all
,
to
spare
her
.
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
smile
and
bow
low
,
and
be
charge
by
Sir
Barnet
with
the
good
compliment
of
himself
and
Lady
Skettles
,
take
his
leave
and
ride
away
:
leave
a
favourable
impression
on
that
worthy
couple
.
<EOS>
Florence
be
seize
with
such
a
shudder
as
he
go
,
that
Sir

adopt
the
popular
superstition

<EOS>
Mr

,
turn
a
corner
,
on
the
instant
,
look
back

and
bow

and
disappear

as

the

the

take
a
long
breath
,
and
then
read
these
word
,
write
below
:
"

recommend
,
as
I
tell
you

from

take

Ned

of
the
little
Midshipman

"
<EOS>
"
  
to
convey
to
posterity
any
idea
of
the
manner
in
which
the
Captain
,
after
turn
this
letter
over
and
over
,
and
read
it
a
score
of
time
,
sit
down
in
his
chair
,
and
hold
a
court
-
martial
on
the
subject
in
his
own
mind
,
would
require
the
united
genius
of
all
the
great
man
,
who
,
discard
their
own
untoward
day
,
have
determine
to
go
down
to
posterity
,
and
have
never
get
there
.
<EOS>
at
first
the
Captain
be
too
much
confound
and
distressed
to
think
of
anything
but
the
letter
itself
;
and
even
when
his
thought
begin
to
glance
upon
the
various
attendant
fact
,
they
may
,
perhaps
,
as
well
have
occupy
themselves
with
their
former
theme
,
for
any
light
they
reflect
on
them
.
<EOS>
in
this
state
of
mind
,
Captain
Cuttle
have
the
Grinder
before
the
court
,
and
no
one
else
,
find
it
a
great
relief
to
decide
,
generally
,
that
he
be
an
object
of
suspicion
:
which
the
Captain
so
clearly
express
in
his
visage
,
that
Rob
remonstrate
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
do
not
,
Captain
!
"
cry
the
Grinder
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
how
you
can
!
<EOS>
what
have
I
do
to
be
look
at
,
like
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My

,
"
say
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
do
not
you
sing
out
afore

you
be
hurt

<EOS>

do
not
you
commit
yourself

whatever
you
do

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not

commit
nothing

Captain

"
answer
Rob
.
  
<EOS>
"
keep
her
free
,
then
,
"
say
the
Captain
,
impressively
,
"
and
ride
easy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
a
deep
sense
of
the
responsibility
impose
upon
him
,
and
the
necessity
of
thoroughly
fathom
this
mysterious
affair
,
as
become
a
man
in
his
relation
with
the
party
,
Captain
Cuttle
resolve
to
go
down
and
examine
the
premise
,
and
to
keep
the
Grinder
with
him
.
<EOS>
consider
that
youth
as
under
arrest
at
present
,
the
Captain
be
in
some
doubt
whether
it
may
not
be
expedient
to
handcuff
him
,
or
tie
his
ankle
together
,
or
attach
a
weight
to
his
leg
;
but
not
be
clear
as
to
the
legality
of
such
formality
,
the
Captain
decide
merely
to
hold
him
by
the
shoulder
all
the
way
,
and
knock
him
down
if
he
make
any
objection
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
he
make
none
,
and
consequently
get
to
the
instrument
-
maker
's
house
without
be
place
under
any
more
stringent
restraint
.
<EOS>
as
the
shutter
be
not
yet
take
down
,
the
Captain
's
first
care
be
to
have
the
shop
open
;
and
when
the
daylight
be
freely
admit
,
he
proceed
,
with
its
aid
,
to
further
investigation
.
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
's
first
care
be
to
establish
himself
in
a
chair
in
the
shop
,
as
President
of
the
solemn
tribunal
that
be
sit
within
him
;
and
to
require
Rob
to
lie
down
in
his
bed
under
the
counter
,
show
exactly
where
he
discover
the
key
and
packet
when
he
awake
<EOS>
,
how
he
find
the
door
when
he
go
to
try
it
,
how
he
start
off
to
Brig
Place
---
cautiously
prevent
the
latter
imitation
from
be
carry
farther
than
the
threshold
---
and
so
on
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
.
<EOS>
when
all
this
have
be
do
several
time
,
the
Captain
shake
his
head
and
seem
to
think
the
matter
have
a
bad
look
.
  
<EOS>
next
,
the
Captain
,
with
some
indistinct
idea
of
find
a
body
,
institute
a
strict
search
over
the
whole
house
;
grope
in
the
cellar
with
a
light
candle
,
thrust
his
hook
behind
door
,
bring
his
head
into
violent
contact
with
beam
,
and
cover
himself
with
cobwebs
.
<EOS>
mount
up
to
the
old
man
's
bed
-
room
,
they
find
that
he
have
not
be
in
bed
on
the
previous
night
,
but
have
merely
lain
down
on
the
coverlet
,
as
be
evident
from
the
impression
yet
remain
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
think
,
Captain
,
"
say
Rob
,
look
round
the
room
,
"
that
when
Mr
Gills
be
go
in
and
out
so
often
,
these
last
few
day
,
he
be
take
little
thing
away
,
piecemeal
,
not
to
attract
attention
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
aye
!
"
say
the
Captain
,
mysteriously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
when
so
,
my
lad
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
return
Rob
,
look
about
,
"
I
do
not
see
his
shaving
tackle
.
<EOS>
nor
his
brush
,
Captain
.
<EOS>
nor
no
shirt
.
<EOS>
nor
yet
his
shoe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
each
of
these
article
be
mention
,
Captain
Cuttle
take
particular
notice
of
the
correspond
department
of
the
Grinder
,
lest
he
should
appear
to
have
be
in
recent
use
,
or
should
prove
to
be
in
present
possession
thereof
.
<EOS>
but
Rob
have
no
occasion
to
shave
,
certainly
be
not
brush
,
and
wear
the
clothe
he
have
wear
for
a
long
time
past
,
beyond
all
possibility
of
mistake
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
should
you
say
,
"
say
the
Captain
---
"
not
commit
yourself
---
about
his
time
of
sheer
off
?
<EOS>
hey
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
think
,
Captain
,
"
return
Rob
,
"
that
he
must
have
go
pretty
soon
after
I
begin
to
snore
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
o'clock
be
that
?
"
say
the
Captain
,
prepare
to
be
very
particular
about
the
exact
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
I
tell
,
Captain
!
"
answer
Rob
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
know
that
I
be
a
heavy
sleeper
at
first
,
and
a
light
one
towards
morning
;
and
if
Mr
Gills
have
come
through
the
shop
near
daybreak
,
though
ever
so
much
on
tip
-
toe
,
I
be
pretty
sure
I
should
have
hear
him
shut
the
door
at
all
event
.
"
  
<EOS>
on
mature
consideration
of
this
evidence
,
Captain
Cuttle
begin
to
think
that
the
instrument
-
maker
must
have
vanish
of
his
own
accord
;
to
which
logical
conclusion
he
be
assist
by
the
letter
address
to
himself
,
which
,
as
be
unquestionably
in
the
old
man
's
handwriting
,
would
seem
,
with
no
great
forcing
,
to
bear
the
construction
,
that
he
arrange
of
his
own
will
,
to
go
,
and
so
go
.
<EOS>
the
Captain
have
next
to
consider
where
and
why
?
<EOS>
and
as
there
be
no
way
whatsoever
that
he
see
to
the
solution
of
the
first
difficulty
,
he
confine
his
medium
-
tuition
to
the
second
.
  
<EOS>
remember
the
old
man
's
curious
manner
,
and
the
farewell
he
have
take
of
him
;
unaccountably
fervent
at
the
time
,
but
quite
intelligible
now
:
a
terrible
apprehension
strengthen
on
the
Captain
,
that
,
overpower
by
his
anxiety
and
regret
for
Walter
,
he
have
be
drive
to
commit
suicide
.
<EOS>
unequal
to
the
wear
and
tear
of
daily
life
,
as
he
have
often
profess
himself
to
be
,
and
shake
as
he
no
doubt
<EOS>
be
by
the
uncertainty
and
defer
hope
he
have
undergo
<EOS>
,
it
seem
no
violently
strain
misgiving
,
but
only
too
probable
.
  
<EOS>
free
from
debt
,
and
with
no
fear
for
his
personal
liberty
,
or
the
seizure
of
his
good
,
what
else
but
such
a
state
of
madness
could
have
hurry
him
away
alone
and
secretly
?
<EOS>
as
to
his
carry
some
apparel
with
him
,
if
he
have
really
do
so
---
and
they
be
not
even
sure
of
that
---
he
may
have
do
so
,
the
Captain
argue
,
to
prevent
inquiry
,
to
distract
attention
from
his
probable
fate
,
or
to
ease
the
very
mind
that
be
now
revolve
all
these
possibility
.
<EOS>
such
,
reduce
into
plain
language
,
and
condense
within
a
small
compass
,
be
the
final
result
and
substance
of
Captain
Cuttle
's
deliberation
:
which
take
a
long
time
to
arrive
at
this
pass
,
and
be
,
like
some
more
public
deliberation
,
very
discursive
and
disorderly
.
  
<EOS>
deject
and
despondent
in
the
extreme
<EOS>
,
Captain
Cuttle
feel
it
just
to
release
Rob
from
the
arrest
in
which
he
have
place
him
,
and
to
enlarge
him
,
subject
to
a
kind
of
honourable
inspection
which
he
still
resolve
to
exercise
;
and
have
hire
a
man
,
from
Brogley
the
Broker
,
to
sit
in
the
shop
during
their
absence
,
the
Captain
,
take
Rob
with
him
,
issue
forth
upon
a
dismal
quest
after
the
mortal
remain
of
Solomon
Gills
.
  
<EOS>
not
a
station
-
house
or
bone
-
house
,
or
work
-
house
in
the
metropolis
escape
a
visitation
from
the
hard
glaze
hat
.
<EOS>
along
the
wharf
,
among
the
shipping
on
the
bank
-
side
,
up
the
river
,
down
the
river
,
here
,
there
,
everywhere
,
it
go
gleam
where
man
be
thickest
,
like
the
hero
's
helmet
in
an
epic
battle
.
<EOS>
for
a
whole
week
the
Captain
read
of
all
the
find
and
miss
people
in
all
the
newspaper
and
handbill
,
and
go
forth
on
expedition
at
all
hour
of
the
day
to
identify
Solomon
Gills
,
in
poor
little
ship
-
boy
who
have
fall
over
-
board
,
an
in
tall
foreigner
with
dark
beard
who
have
take
poison
---
"
to
make
sure
,
"
Captain
Cuttle
say
,
"
that
it
warn't
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
sure
thing
that
it
never
be
,
and
that
the
good
Captain
have
no
other
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
at
last
abandon
these
attempt
as
hopeless
,
and
set
himself
to
consider
what
be
to
be
do
next
.
<EOS>
after
several
new
perusal
of
his
poor
friend
's
letter
,
he
consider
that
the
maintenance
of
"
a
home
in
the
old
place
for
Walter
"
be
the
primary
duty
impose
upon
him
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
the
Captain
's
decision
be
,
that
he
would
keep
house
on
the
premise
of
Solomon
gill
himself
,
and
would
go
into
the
instrument
-
business
,
and
see
what
come
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
this
step
involve
the
relinquishment
of
his
apartment
at
Mrs
MacStinger
's
,
and
he
know
that
resolute
woman
would
never
hear
of
his
desert
them
,
the
Captain
take
the
desperate
determination
of
run
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
look
ye
here
,
my
lad
,
"
say
the
Captain
to
Rob
,
when
he
have
mature
this
notable
scheme
,
"
to

I
shall
not

but
you
keep

"
  
"
very

Rob

<EOS>
"
You

the

condescendingly

I
do
not

<EOS>
but
what
you
may
get
promotion
,
if
you
and
me
should
pull
together
with
a
will

<EOS>
but

<EOS>
"
I
will
be

to
do
it

reply
Rob

<EOS>
"
because
you
understand

resume
the
Captain
,
come
back
again
to
enforce
this
charge
upon
his
mind
,
"
there
may
be
,
for
anything
I
can
say
,
a
chase
;
and
I
may

if
you
do
not

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Rob
again
assure
the
Captain
that
he
would
be
prompt
and
wakeful
;
and
the
Captain
have
make
this
prudent
arrangement
,
go
home
to
Mrs
MacStinger
's
for
the
last
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
sense
the
Captain
have
of
its
be
the
last
time
,
and
of
the
awful
purpose
hide
beneath
his
blue
waistcoat
,
inspire
him
with
such
a
mortal
dread
of
Mrs
MacStinger
,
that
the
sound
of
that
lady
's
foot
down
stair
at
any
time
of

day

be
sufficient
to
throw
him
into
a
fit
of
tremble

<EOS>
It
fall
out
,
too
,
that
Mrs
MacStinger
be
in
a
charming
temper
---
mild
and
placid
as
a
house

lamb

and
Captain
Cuttle

conscience
suffer
terrible
twinge

when
she
come
up
to
inquire
if
she
could

him
nothing

what
the

next

whenever

how
often
he
dart
out

elude
imaginary
MacStingers

to

<EOS>
Captain

in

fatiguing
service
to
inspect
the
stock

in
connexion
with
which
he
have
the
general
idea
(
very
laborious
to
Rob
)
that
too
much
friction
could
not
be
bestow
upon
it
,
and
that
it
could

<EOS>
He

be
smoke

<EOS>
as

feel

he
be
unable

make
out

Hearing

all
this
in
wheezy
whisper

sit
gurgle
in

throat

shine
resplendent
at

end
of

support
by
the
milder
lustre
of
Mr

at
the
other

while
Carker
on
one
side
lend
his
ray
to
either
light
,

suffer
it
to
merge
into
both
,
as
occasion

<EOS>
during

first
course

two

the

be
usually
grave

for
the
Native

in
obedience
to
general
order
,
secretly
issue
,
collect
every
sauce

cruet
round
him

him
a

in

out

up
the
content

besides
which

the

private
zest

flavour
on

side

table

with
which
the

daily
scorch
himself

nothing

strange
machine
out
of
which

spirt
unknown
liquid

on

his
sociality
consist

excessive
slyness

then

sly

oblige

on

he
would
probably
have
disappear
under

in

Mr

look
into
his
plate
with
a
conscious
air
,
"
we
will
consecrate
this

Mr
Dombey

<EOS>
the
entrance
of
the
waiter
with
new
dish
cause
the
Major
to
be
slyer
yet
,

in
a
more
serious
vein
.
<EOS>
"
for
though
among

his

on

lip

and
speak
half
apart
to
Carker

hold
that
name
too
sacred

<EOS>
not

Sir

"
  
<EOS>
this
be
respectful
and
become
on
the
Major
's
part
,
and
Mr
Dombey
plainly
feel
it
so
.
<EOS>
although
embarrassed
in
his
own
frigid
way
,
by
the
Major
's
allusion
,
Mr
Dombey
have
no
objection
to
such
rallying
,
it
be
clear
,
but
rather
court
it
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
Major
have
be
pretty
near
the
truth
,
when
he
have
divine
that
morning
that
the
great
man
who
be
too
haughty
formally
to
consult
with
,
or
confide
in
his
prime
minister
,
on
such
a
matter
,
yet
wish
him
to
be
fully
possess
of
it

<EOS>
let
this
be
how
it
may
,
he
often
glance
at
Mr
Carker
while
the
Major
ply
his
light
artillery
,
and
seem
watchful
of
its
effect
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
Major
,
have
secure
an
attentive
listener
,
and
a
smiler
who
have
not
his
match
in
all
the
world
---
"
in
short
,
a
de

vilish
intelligent
and
agreeable
fellow

as
he
often
afterwards
declare

be
not
go
to
let
him
off
with
a
little
slyness
personal
to
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
on
the
removal
of
the
cloth
,
the
Major
develop
himself
as
a
choice
spirit
in
the
broad
and
more
comprehensive
range
of
narrate
regimental
story
,
and
crack
regimental
joke
,
which
he
do
with
such
prodigal
exuberance
,
that
Carker
be
(
or
feign
to
be
)
quite
exhausted
with
laughter
and
admiration
:
while
Mr
Dombey
look
on
over
his
starched
cravat
,
like
the
Major
's
proprietor

like

stately
showman

bear
dance
well

hoarse

meat

the
display

social
power

to
render
himself
intelligible
any
longer

they
adjourn
to
coffee

<EOS>
after

the

inquire
of
Mr

with
little
apparent
hope
of
an
answer
in

affirmative

if
he
play

lay
himself
on

without

play

well

in

he
play

such
perfection

at

Carker

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
It
may
be
only
the
false
mouth
,
so
smooth
and
wide
;
and
yet
there
seem
to
lurk
beneath
the
humility
and
subserviency
of
this
short
speech
,
a
something
like
a
snarl
;
and
,
for
a
moment
,
one
may
have
think
that
the
white
tooth
be
prone
to
bite
the
hand
they
fawn
upon
.
<EOS>
but
the
major
think
nothing
about
it
;
and
Mr
Dombey
lie
meditate
with
his
eye
half
shut
,
during
the
whole
of
the
play
,
which
last
until
bed

by

Mr

though
the

have
mount
high
into

good
opinion

insomuch
that
when
he
leave
the

at
his
own
room
before
go
to

,
the
Major
as
a
special
attention
,
send
the
Native

who
always
rest
on
a
mattress
spread
upon
the
ground
at
his
master
's
door
---
along
the
gallery
,
to
light
him
to
his
room
in
state

<EOS>
there
be
a
faint
blur
on
the
surface
of
the
mirror
in
Mr
Carker
's
chamber
,
and
its
reflection
be
,
perhaps
,
a
false
one
.
<EOS>
but
it
show
,
that
night
,
the
image
of
a
man
,
who
see
,
in
his
fancy

a
crowd
of
people
slumber
on
the
ground
at
his
foot

like
the
poor
Native
at
his

door

who
pick
his

look
down

maliciously

headlong

stream
of
song

and
drop
among
the
green
wheat
near
him
,
ripple
in
the
breath
of
the
morning
like

he
spring
up
from
his
reverie

look
round
with
a
sudden
smile
,
as
courteous

as
soft
as

<EOS>
though
always
somewhat
formal

in
intimation
of
the
great

whom
he
serve

he
stop
short
of
the

of
Mr

stiffness
:
at
once
perhaps
because
he
know
it
to
be
ludicrous
,
and
because
in

so
he
find
another
means
of
express
his
sense
of

distance

<EOS>
some

him
indeed
,
in
this

on

prone

and
Mr

be
not
accountable
for
its
bad
propensity

<EOS>
clean

about
meadow

among
avenue

until
it

He

and
so
forth
;
and
as
they
be
still
one
little
party
,
and
the
Major
be
rather
in
the
shade
:
be
sleepy
during
the
process
of
digestion
:
Mr
Carker
become
communicative
and
agreeable
.
<EOS>
at
first
,
he
address
himself
for
the
most
part
to
Mrs
Skewton
;
but
as
that
sensitive
lady
be
in
such
ecstasy
with
the
work
of
art
,
after
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
,
that
she
could
do
nothing
but
yawn
(
they
be
such
perfect
inspiration
,
she
observe
as
a
reason
for
that
mark
of
rapture
)
,
he
transfer
his
attention
to
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
say
little
beyond
an
occasional
"
very
true
,
Carker
,
"
or
"
indeed
,
Carker
,
"
but
he
tacitly
encourage
Carker
to
proceed
,
and
inwardly
approve
of
his
behaviour
very
much
:
deem
it
as
well
that
somebody
should
talk
,
and
think
that
his
remark
,
which
be
,
as
one
may
say
,
a
branch
of
the
parent
establishment
,
may
amuse
Mrs
Granger
.
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
,
who
possess
an
excellent
discretion
,
never
take
the
liberty
of
address
that
lady
,
direct
;
but
she
seem
to
listen
,
though
she
never
look
at
him
;
and
once
or
twice
,
when
he
be
emphatic
in
his
peculiar
humility
,
the
twilight
smile
steal
over
her
face
,
not
as
a
light
,
but
as
a
deep
black
shadow
.
  
<EOS>
Warwick
Castle
be
at
length
pretty
well
exhausted
,
and
the
Major
very
much
so
:
to
say
nothing
of
Mrs
Skewton
,
whose
peculiar
demonstration
of
delight
have
become
very
frequent
indeed
:
the
carriage
be
again
put
in
requisition
,
and
they
ride
to
several
admired
point
of
view
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
ceremoniously
observe
of
one
of
these
,
that
a
sketch
,
however
slight
,
from
the
fair
hand
of
Mrs
Granger
,
would
be
a
remembrance
to
him
of
that
agreeable
day
:
though
he
want
no
artificial
remembrance
,
he
be
sure
<EOS>
(
here
Mr
Dombey
make
another
of
his
bow
)
,
which
he
must
always
highly
value
.
<EOS>
wither
the
lean

Edith

sketch

his
arm

be
immediately
call
upon
by
Mrs
Skewton
to
produce
the
same
:
and
the
carriage
stop
,
that
Edith
may
make
the
drawing
,
which
Mr
Dombey
be
to
put
away
among
his
treasure
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
be
afraid
I
trouble
you
too
much
,
"
say
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
by
no
mean
.
<EOS>
where
would
you
wish
it
take
from
?
"
<EOS>
she
answer
,
turn
to
him
with
the
same
enforced
attention
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
with
another
bow
,
which
crack
the
starch
in
his
cravat
,
would
beg
to
leave
that
to
the
artist
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
you
choose
for
yourself
,
"
say
Edith
.
  
<EOS>
"
suppose
then
,
"
say
Mr
Dombey
,
"
we
say
from
here
.
<EOS>
It
appear
a
good
spot
for
the
purpose
,
or
---
Carker
,
what
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
happen
to
be
in
the
foreground
,
at
some
little
distance
,
a
grove
of
tree
,
not
unlike
that
in
which
Mr
Carker
have
make
his
chain
of
footstep
in
the
morning
,
and
with
a
seat
under
one
tree
,
greatly
resemble
,
in
the
general
character
of
its
situation
,
the
point
where
his
chain
have
break
.
  
<EOS>
"
may
I
venture
to
suggest
to
Mrs
Granger
,
"
say
Carker
,
"
that
that
be
an
interesting
---
almost
a
curious
---
point
of
view
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
follow
the
direction
of
his
riding
-
whip
with
her
eye
,
and
raise
them
quickly
to
his
face
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
second
glance
they
have
exchange
since
their
introduction
;
and
would
have
be
exactly
like
the
first
,
but
that
its
expression
be
plainer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
like
that
?
"
say
Edith
to
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
charm
,
"
say
Mr
Dombey
to
Edith
.
  
<EOS>
therefore
the
carriage
be
drive
to
the
spot
where
Mr
Dombey
be
to
be
charm
;
and
Edith
,
without
move
from
her
seat
,
and
open
her
sketch
-
book
with
her
usual
proud
indifference
,
begin
to
sketch
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
pencil
be
all
pointless
,
"
she
say
,
stop
and
turn
them
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
pray
allow
me
,
"
say
Mr
Dombey
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
or
Carker
will
do
it
better
,
as
he
understand
these
thing
.
<EOS>
Carker
,
have
the
goodness
to
see
to
these
pencil
for
Mrs
Granger
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
ride
up
close
to
the
carriage
-
door
on
Mrs
Granger
's
side
,
and
let
the
rein
fall
on
his
horse
's
neck
,
take
the
pencil
from
her
hand
with
a
smile
and
a
bow
,
and
sit
in
the
saddle
leisurely
mend
them
.
<EOS>
have
do
so
,
he
beg
to
be
allow
to
hold
them
,
and
to
hand
them
to
her
as
they
be
require
;
and
thus
Mr
Carker
,
with
many
commendation
of
Mrs
Granger
's
extraordinary
skill
---
especially
in
tree
---
remain
close
at
her
side
,
look
over
the
drawing
as
she
make
it
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
in
the
meantime
stand
bolt
upright
in
the
carriage
like
a
highly
respectable
ghost
,
look
on
too
;
while
Cleopatra
and
the
Major
dally
as
two
ancient
dove
may
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
satisifie
with
that
,
or
shall
I
finish
it
a
little
more
?
<EOS>
"
say
Edith
,
show
the
sketch
to
Mr
Dombey
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
beg
that
it
may
not
be
touch
;
it
be
perfection
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
most
extraordinary
,
"
say
Carker
,
bring
every
one
of
his
red
gum
to
bear
upon
his
praise
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
prepared
for
anything
so
beautiful
,
and
so
unusual
altogether
.
"
  
this
may
have
apply
to
the
sketcher
no
less
than
to
the
sketch
;
but
Mr
Carker
's
manner
be
openness
itself
---
not
as
to
his
mouth
alone
,
but
as
to
his
whole
spirit
.
<EOS>
so
it
continue
to
be
while
the
drawing
be
lay
aside
for
Mr
Dombey
,
and
while
the
sketching
material
be
put
up
;
then
he
hand
in
the
pencil
(
which
be
receive
with
a
distant
acknowledgment
of
his
help
,
but
without
a
look
)
,
and
tighten
his
rein
,
fall
back
,
and
follow
the
carriage
again
.
  
<EOS>
thinking
,
perhaps
,
as
he
ride
,
that
even
this
trivial
sketch
have
be
make
and
deliver
to
its
owner
,
as
if
it
have
be
bargain
for
and
buy
.
<EOS>
think
,
perhaps
,
that
although
she
have
assent
with
such
perfect
readiness
to
his
request
,
her
haughty
face
,
bent
over
the
drawing
,
or
glance
at
the
distant
object
represent
in
it
,
have
be
the
face
of
a
proud
woman
,
engage
in
a
sordid
and
miserable
transaction
.
<EOS>
think
,
perhaps
,
of
such
thing
:
but
smile
certainly
,
and
while
he
seem
to
look
about
him
freely
,
in
enjoyment
of
the
air
and
exercise
,
keep
always
that
sharp
corner
of
his
eye
upon
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
a
stroll
among
the
haunted
ruin
of
Kenilworth
,
and
more
ride
to
more
point
of
view
;
most
of
which
,
Mrs
Skewton
remind
Mr
Dombey
,
Edith
have
already
sketch
,
as
he
have
see
in
look
over
her
drawing
:
<EOS>
bring
the
day
's
expedition
to
a
close
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Skewton
and
Edith
be
drive
to
their
own
lodging
;
Mr
Carker
be
graciously
invite
by
Cleopatra
to
return
thither
with
Mr
Dombey
and
the
Major
,
in
the
evening
,
to
hear
some
of
Edith
's
music
;
and
the
three
gentleman
repair
to
their
hotel
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
the
dinner
be
the
counterpart
of
yesterday
's
,
except
that
the
Major
be
twenty
-
four
hour
more
triumphant
and
less
mysterious
.
<EOS>
Edith
be
toast
again
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
be
again
agreeably
embarrassed
.
<EOS>
and
Mr
Carker
be
full
of
interest
and
praise
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
other
visitor
at
Mrs
Skewton
's
.
<EOS>
Edith
's
drawing
be
strew
about
the
room
,
a
little
more
abundantly
than
usual
perhaps
;
and
Withers
,
the
wan
page
,
hand
round
a
little
strong
tea
.
<EOS>
the
harp
be
there
;
the
piano
be
there
;
and
Edith
sing
and
play
.
<EOS>
but
even
the
music
be
play
by
Edith
to
Mr
Dombey
's
order
,
as
it
be
,
in
the
same
uncompromising
way
.
<EOS>
as
thus
.
  
<EOS>
"
Edith
,
my
dear
love
,
"
say
Mrs
Skewton
,
half
an
hour
after
tea
,
"
Mr
Dombey
be
die
to
hear
you
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Dombey
have
life
enough
leave
to
say
so
for
himself
,
mama

I
have
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
immensely
oblige

say
Mr

.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
wish

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
piano

<EOS>
"
hesitate
Mr

.
  
<EOS>
"
whatever
you
please
.
<EOS>
You
have
only
to
choose
.
"
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
she
begin
with
the
piano
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
same
with
the
harp
;
the
same
with
her
singing
;
the
same
with
the
selection
of
the
piece
that
she
sing
and
play
.
<EOS>
such
frigid
and
constrain
,
yet
prompt
and
pointed
acquiescence
with
the
wish
he
impose
upon
her
,
and
on
no
one
else
,
be
sufficiently
remarkable
to
penetrate
through
all
the
mystery
of
picquet
,
and
impress
itself
on
Mr
Carker
's
keen
attention
.
<EOS>
nor
do
he
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
Mr
Dombey
be
evidently
proud
of
his
power
,
and
like
to
show
it
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
Mr
Carker
play
so
well
---
some
game
with
the
Major
,
and
some
with
Cleopatra
,
whose
vigilance
of
eye
in
respect
of
Mr
Dombey
and
Edith
<EOS>
no
lynx
could
have
surpass
---
that
he
even
heighten
his
position
in
the
lady
-
mother
's
good
grace
;
and
when
on
take
leave
he
regret
that
he
would
be
oblige
to
return
to
London
next
morning
,
Cleopatra
trust
:
community
of
feel
not

:
that
it
be
far
from
be
the
last
time
they
would
meet
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
"
say
Mr
Carker
,
with
an
expressive
look
at
the
couple
in
the
distance
,
as
he
draw
towards
the
door
,
follow
the
Major
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
so

"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
who
have
take
a
stately
leave
of
Edith
,
bent
,
or
make
some
approach
to
a
bend
,
over
Cleopatra
's
couch
,
and
say
,
in
a
low
voice
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
request
Mrs

<EOS>
Cleopatra

so
much
fluttered
and
move

by

this
,
of
course
,
incomprehensible
speech
,
that
she
could
only
shut

give
Mr

cry

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
's
mind
run
high
on
this
theme
,
and
have
do
for
some
day
.
<EOS>
Mr
Carker
,
in
the
two
visit
with
which
he
have
follow
up
his
first
one
,
have
assume
a
confidence
between
himself
and
her
---
a
right
on
his
part
to
be
mysterious
and
stealthy
,
in
tell
her
that
the
ship
be
still
unheard
of
---
a
kind
of
mildly
restrain
power
and
authority
over
her
---
that
make
her
wonder
,
and
cause
her
great
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
means
of
repel
it
,
or
of
free
herself
from
the
web
he
be
gradually
wind
about
her
;
for
that
would
have
require
some
art
and
knowledge
of
the
world
,
oppose
to
such
address
be
his
;
and
Florence
have
none
.
<EOS>
true
,
he
have
say
no
more
to
her
than
that
there
be
no
news
of
the
ship
,
and
that
he
fear
the
bad
;
but
how
he
come
to
know
that
she
be
interested
in
the
ship
,
and
why
he
have
the
right
to
signify
his
knowledge
to
her
,
so
insidiously
and
darkly
<EOS>
,
trouble
Florence
very
much
.
  
<EOS>
this
conduct
on
the
part
of
Mr
Carker
,
and
her
habit
of
often
consider
it
with
wonder
and
uneasiness
,
begin
to
invest
him
with
an
uncomfortable
fascination
in
Florence
's
thought
.
<EOS>
a
more
distinct
remembrance
of
his
feature
,
voice
,
and
manner
:
which
she
sometimes
court
,
as
a
means
of
reduce
him
to
the
level
of
a
real
personage
,
capable
of
exert
no
great
charm
over
her
than
another
:
do
not
remove
the
vague
impression
.
<EOS>
and
yet
he
never
frown
,
or
look
upon
her
with
an
air
of
dislike
or
animosity
,
but
be
always
smile
and
serene
.
  
<EOS>
again
,
Florence
,
in
pursuit
of
her
strong
purpose
with
reference
to
her
father
,
and
her
steady
resolution
to
believe
that
she
be
herself
unwittingly
to
blame
for
their
so
cold
and
distant
relation
,
would
recall
to
mind
that
this
gentleman
be
his
confidential
friend
,
and
would
think
,
with
an
anxious
heart
,
could
her
struggle
tendency
to
dislike
and
fear
him
be
a
part
of
that
misfortune
in
her
,
which
have
turn
her
father
's
love
adrift
,
and
leave
her
so
alone
?
<EOS>
She
dread
that
it
may
be
;
sometimes
believe
it
be
:
then
she
resolve
that
she
would
try
to
conquer
this
wrong
feeling
;
persuade
herself
that
she
be
honour
and
encourage
by
the
notice
of
her
father
's
friend
;
and
hope
that
patient
observation
of
him
and
trust
in
him
would
lead
her
bleed
foot
along
that
stony
road
which
end
in
her
father
's
heart
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
with
no
one
to
advise
her
---
for
she
could
advise
with
no
one
without
seem
to
complain
against
him
---
gentle
Florence
toss
on
an
uneasy
sea
of
doubt
and
hope
;
and
Mr

<EOS>
Florence
have
a
new
reason
in
all
this
for
wish
to
be
at
home
again
.
<EOS>
Her
lonely
life
be
better
suited
to
her
course
of
timid
hope
and
doubt
;
and
she
fear
sometimes
,
that
in
her
absence
she
may
miss
some
hopeful
chance
of
testify
her
affection
for
her
father
.
<EOS>
Heaven
know
,
she
may
have
set
her
mind
at
rest
,
poor
child
!
<EOS>
on
this
last
point
;
but
her
slight
love
be
flutter
within
her
,
and
,
even
in
her
sleep
,
it
fly
away
in
dream
,
and
nestle
,
like
a

<EOS>

<EOS>
of
Walter

often

<EOS>
ah

<EOS>
how
often
,
when
the
night
be
gloomy
,
and
the
wind
be
blow
round
<EOS>
the
house!but
hope
be
strong
in
her
breast
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
difficult
for
the
young
and
ardent
,
even
with
such
experience
as
hers
,
to
imagine
youth
and
ardour
quench
like
a
weak
flame
,
and
the
bright
day
of
life
merge
into
night
,
at
noon
,
that
hope

strong

<EOS>
Her
tear
fall
frequently
for
Walter

suffering
;
but
rarely
for
his

death
,
and
never
long
.
  
<EOS>
She

to
the
old

but

her
note

which

<EOS>
thus

where

,
in
the
continual
resumption

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
there

however

albeit

who

constant

<EOS>
this

Mr

some
week

blimberian
bond
and
soar
into
freedom
with
his
ring
on
,
call
regularly
every
other
day
,
and
leave
a
perfect
pack
of
card
at
the
hall

door
;
so
many
indeed
,
that
the
ceremony
be
quite
a
deal
on
the
part
of
Mr
Toots
,
and
a
hand
at
whist
on
the
part
of
the
servant

<EOS>
Mr
Toots
,
likewise
,
with
the
bold
and
happy
idea
of
prevent
the
family
from
forget
him
(
but
there
be
reason
to
suppose
that
this
expedient
originate
in
the
teem
brain
of
the
Chicken

,
have
establish
a
six

for
the
purpose

and
conceal
the
perpetual
black
eye
with
which
he
be
afflict
,
beneath
a
green
shade
.
<EOS>
previous
to
the
institution
of
this
equipage
,
Mr
Toots
sound
the
Chicken
on
a
hypothetical
case
,
as
,
suppose
the
Chicken
to
be
enamour
of
a
young
lady
name
Mary
,
and
to
have
conceive
the
intention
of
start
a
boat
of
his
own
,
what
would
he
call
that
boat
?
<EOS>
the
Chicken
reply
,
with
diver
strong
asseveration
,
that
he
would
either
christen
it
Poll
or
the
Chicken
's
delight
.
<EOS>
improve
on
this
idea
,
Mr
Toots
,
after
deep
study
and
the
exercise
of
much
invention
,
resolve
to
call
his
boat
the
Toots
's
Joy
,
as
a
delicate
compliment
to
Florence
,
of
which
no
man
know
the
party
,
could
possibly
miss
the
appreciation
.
  
<EOS>
stretch
on
a
crimson
cushion
in
his
gallant
bark
,
with
his
shoe
in
the

,
Mr

,
in
the
exercise
of
his
project
,
have
come
up
the
river
,
day
after
day
,
and
week
after
week
,
and
have
flit
to
and
fro
,
near
Sir
Barnet
's
garden
,
and
have
cause
his
crew
to
cut
across
and
across
the
river
at
sharp
angle
,
for
his
well
exhibition
to
any
looker
-
out
from
Sir
Barnet

window
,
and
have
have
such
evolution
perform
by
the
Toots
's
Joy
as
have
fill
all
the
neighbour
part
of
the
water

side
with
astonishment
.
<EOS>
but
whenever
he
see
any
one
in
Sir
Barnet
's
garden
on
the
brink
of
the
river
,
Mr
Toots
always
feign
to
be
pass
there
,
by
a
combination
of
coincidence
of
the
most
singular
and
unlikely
description
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
be

,
toot
?
"
<EOS>
Sir
Barnet
would
say
,
wave
his

the
artful
Chicken
steer
close
in

.
  
<EOS>
"
how

"
<EOS>
Mr

"

I
should
see
you
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
,
in
his
sagacity
,
always
say
this
,
as
if
,
instead
of
that
be
Sir
Barnet
's
house
,
it
be
some
desert
edifice
on
the
bank
of
the
Nile
,
or
gange
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never

so
surprised

Mr

Whereupon
Florence

Mr

<EOS>
the
pleasant
voice
of
Florence
would
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
will
not

come
ashore

<EOS>
Sir

and
again
she

that
the
dull
home
,
free

such
reminder

<EOS>
how
long
it
seem
since
she
have
wander
through
the
silent
room
:
since
she
have
last
crept
,
softly
and
afraid
,
into
those

:
since
she
have
feel
the
solemn
but
yet
soothing
influence
of
the
beloved
dead
in
every
action
of
her
daily
life

<EOS>
this
new
farewell

<EOS>
Florence
feel
that
,
for
her
,
there
be
great
peace
within
it
than
elsewhere

<EOS>
It
be
well
and
easy
to
keep
her
secret
shut
up
there
,
among
the
tall
dark
wall
,
than
to
carry
it
abroad
into
the
light
,
and
try
to
hide
it
from
a
crowd
of
happy
eye
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
to
pursue
the
study
of
her
love
heart
,
alone
,
and
find
no
new
discouragement
in
love
heart
about
her

<EOS>
It

easy
to
hope
,

pray
,
and
love
on

with
constancy
and
patience
,
in
the
tranquil
sanctuary
of
such
remembrance

although
it

She

her
old
enchant
dream
of
life

and
long
for
the
old
dark
door

once
again

<EOS>
full
of
such
thought

they
turn
into
the
long
and
sombre
street
.
<EOS>
Florence
be
not
on
that
side
of
the
carriage
which

and
as
the
distance

between
them
and

she
look
out
of
her
window
for
the
child
over
the
way

in
amazement

attentively

hope

state

<EOS>
I
confess
it
take
me
rather
by
surprise
,
however
gratify
;
because
when
Paul
go
out
of
town
I
have
no
idea
at
all
that
he
would
form
any
attachment
out
of
town
,
and
he
certainly
have
no
attachment
when
he
leave
here
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
seem
to
be
extremely
desirable
in
every
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
the
mother
be
a
most
genteel
and
elegant
creature
,
and
I
have
no
right
whatever
to
dispute
the
policy
of
her
live
with
them
:
which
be
Paul
's
affair
,
not
mine
---
and
as
to
Paul
's
choice
,
herself
,
I
have
only
see
her
picture
yet
,
but
that
be
beautiful
indeed

Lucretia

I
have
no

you
will
be
happy
to
hear
that

penalty

Miss

energy

remarkable
opposition

disconcerted
face

while
that
poor
lady
trickle
slowly
down
upon
him
the
very
last
sprinkling
of
the
little
watering

so
as

there
be

that
Florence
be
even
more
sensible

on

<EOS>
She
lead
Florence
to

I
would
have
speak

find

change

drop
her

,

make

falter
again
.
  
<EOS>

I
be
afraid
it

distress
him

and
as
you
say
you
would
be
here
again
soon
,
Mama
,
and
be
the
mistress
of
everything

I
determine
to
take
courage
and
ask
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Edith
sit
look
at
her
,
with
her
brilliant
eye
intent
upon
her
face
,
until
Florence
raise
her
own
,
she
,
in
her
turn
,
withdraw
her
gaze
,
and
turn
it
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
that
Florence
think
how
different
this
lady
's
beauty
be
,
from
what
she
have
suppose
.
<EOS>
She
have
think
it
of
a
proud
and
lofty
kind
;
yet
her
manner
be
so
subdued
and
gentle
,
that
if
she
have
be
of
Florence
's
own
age
and
character
,
it
scarcely
could
have
invite
confidence
more
.
  
<EOS>
except
when
a
constrained
and
singular
reserve
creep
over
her
;
and
then
she
seem
(
but
Florence
hardly
understand
this
,
though
she
could
not
choose
but
notice
it
,
and
think
about
it
)
as
if
she
be
humble
before
Florence
,
and
ill
at
ease
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
say
that
she
be
not
her
Mama
yet
,
and
when
Florence
have
call
her
the
mistress
of
everything
there
,
this
change
in
her
be
quick
and
startling
;
and
now
,
while
the
eye
of
Florence
rest
on
her
face
,
she
sit
as
though
she
would
have
shrink
and
hide
from
her
,
rather
than
as
one
about
to
love
and
cherish
her
,
in
right
of
such
a
near
connexion
.
  
<EOS>
She
give
Florence
her
ready
promise
,
about
her
new
room
,
and
say
she
would
give
direction
about
it
herself
.
<EOS>
She
then
ask
some
question
concern
poor
Paul
;
and
when
they
have
sit
in
conversation
for
some
time
,
tell
Florence
she
have
come
to
take
her
to
her
own
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
come
to
London
now
,
my
mother
and
I
,
"
say
Edith
,
"
and
you
shall
stay
with
us
until
I
be
married
.
<EOS>
I
wish
that
we
should
know
and
trust
each
other
,
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
kind
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
say
Florence
,
"
dear
Mama
.
<EOS>
how
much
I
thank
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
say
now
,
for
it
may
be
the
good
opportunity
,
"
continue
Edith
,
look
round
to
see
that
they
be
quite
alone
,
and
speak
in
a
low
voice
,
"
that
when
I
be
married
,
and
have
go
away
for
some
week
,
I
shall
be
easy
at
heart
if
you
will
come
home
here
.
<EOS>
no
matter
who
invite
you
to
stay
elsewhere
,
come
home
here
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
to
be
alone
then
---
what
I
would
say
be
,
"
she
add
,
check
herself
,
"
<EOS>
that
I
know
well
you
be
good
at
home
,
dear
Florence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
come
home
on
the
very
day
,
Mama
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
rely
on
that
promise
.
<EOS>
now
,
prepare
to
come
with
me
,
dear
girl
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
me
down
stair
when
you
be
ready
.
"
   
<EOS>
slowly
and
<EOS>
thoughtfully
do
Edith
wander
alone
through
the
mansion
of
which
she
be
so
soon
to
be
the
lady
:
and
little
heed
take
she
of
all
the
elegance
and
splendour
<EOS>
it
begin
to
display
.
<EOS>
the
same
indomitable
haughtiness
of
soul
,
the
same
proud
scorn
express
in
eye
and
lip
,
the
same
fierce
beauty
,
only
tame
by
a
sense
of
its
own
little
worth
,
and
of
the
little
worth
of
everything
around
it
,
go
through
the
grand
saloons
and
hall
,
that
have
get
loose
among
the
shady
tree
,
and
rage
and
rent
themselves
.
<EOS>
the
mimic
rose
on
the
wall
and
floor
be
set
round
with
sharp
thorn
,
that
tear
her
breast
;
in
every
scrap
of
gold
so
dazzling
to
the
eye
,
she
see
some
hateful
atom
of
her
purchase
-
money
;
the
broad
high
mirror
show
her
,
at
full
length
,
a
woman
with
a
noble
quality
yet
dwell
in
her
nature
,
who
be
too
false
to
her
well
self
,
and
too
debased
and
lose
,
to
save
herself
.
<EOS>
She
believe
that
all
this
be
so
plain
,
more
or
less
,
to
all
eye
,
that
she
have
no
resource
or
power
of
self
-
assertion
but
in
pride
:
and
with
this
pride
,
which
torture
her
own
heart
night
and
day
,
she
fight
her
fate
out
,
brave
it

be
this
the
woman
whom
Florence
---
an
innocent

strong
only
in

earnestness

simple

so
impress

that

hush

pride
itself

now
sit

with

say
Mrs

in
a
low
voice

which
convey
her
opinion
that
Florence
be
in
a
very
unfinished

It

Her

She

so
suddenly

harshly

scarcely
believe

be
the

<EOS>
Mrs

then
tell
Florence
,
as
another
and
safe
diversion

that
her
father
be
come
to
dinner
,
and
that
he
would
no
doubt
be
charmingly
surprised
to
see
her
;
as
he
have
speak
last
night
of
dressing
in
the
city

have
know
nothing
of
Edith

design
,
the
execution

Mrs

throw
him
into

ecstasy

Florence

so
keen

hour

know
how
to
frame
an
entreaty
to
be
suffer
to
return
home

without
involve
her
father

explanation

she
would
have
hurry
back
on

bareheade

breathless

alone

rather

the
risk
of

she

She

who
in

engrossment
do
not

push
Florence
behind

enormous
falsehood

he
could
hardly

be
more
disconcert

he

when
Mrs

Cleopatra

off

with
tolerable
briskness
,
after
the
last
benediction
,
Mr
Dombey
take
her
arm
in
his
and
lead
her
ceremoniously
down
stair
;
one
of
the
very
tall
young
man
on
hire

whose
organ
of
veneration

imperfectly
develop

thrust
his
tongue
into
his

for
the
entertainment

as
the

turn
into
the
dining

room
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
and
Edith
be
already
there
,
and
sit
side
by
side
.
<EOS>
Florence
would
have
rise
when
her
father
enter
,
to
resign
her
chair
to
him

but
Edith
openly
put
her
hand
upon
her
arm

and
Mr

take
an
opposite
place
at
the
round
table
.
  
<EOS>
the
conversation
be

entirely

Mrs

<EOS>
Florence
hardly
dare
to
raise
her
eye

lest
they
should
reveal
the
trace
of
tear
;
far
less
dare
to
speak

Edith
never
utter

in
answer
to
a
question

verily

Cleopatra
work
hard

for

like

cold

as
silent

still

"
They

return
Edith

turn
on
her

a
slight
contraction
of
her
brow

<EOS>
"
You

Mr

"
  
<EOS>
"
very
true

"
My

you
must
really
come
and
kiss
me
once
more
,
if
you
please
,
my

"
  
<EOS>
singular
coincidence
,
that
these
gush
of
interest
in
Florence
hurry
Cleopatra
away
from
almost
every
dialogue
in
which
Edith
have
a
share
,
however
trifle
!
<EOS>
Florence
have
certainly
never
undergo
so
much
embrace
,
and
perhaps
have
never
be
,
unconsciously
,
so
useful
in
her
life
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
be
far
from
quarrel
,
in
his
own
breast
,
with
the
manner
of
his
beautiful
betrothed
.
<EOS>
He
have
that
good
reason
for
sympathy
with
haughtiness
and
coldness
,
which
be
find
in
a
fellow
-
feeling
.
<EOS>
It
flatter
him
to
think
how
these
defer
to
him
,
in
Edith
's
case
,
and
seem
to
have
no
will
apart
from
his
.
<EOS>
It
flatter
him
to
picture
to
himself
,
this
proud
and
stately
woman
do
the
honour
of
his
house
,
and
chill
his
guest
after
his
own
manner
.
<EOS>
the
dignity
of
Dombey
and
Son
would
be
heighten
and
maintain
,
indeed
,
in
such
hand
.
  
<EOS>
so
think
Mr
Dombey
,
when
he
be
leave
alone
at
the
dining
-
table
,
and
muse
upon
his
past
and
future
fortune
:
find
no
uncongeniality
in
an
air
of
scant
and
gloomy
state
that
pervade
the
room
,
in
colour
a
dark
brown
,
with
black
hatchment
of
picture
blotch
the
wall
,
and
twenty
-
four
black
chair
,
with
almost
as
many
nail
in
them
as
so
many
coffin
,
wait
like
mute
,
upon
the
threshold
of
the
Turkey
carpet
;
and
two
exhausted
negro
hold
up
two
withered
branch
of
candelabra
on
the
sideboard
,
and
a
musty
smell
prevail
as
if
the
ashe
of
ten
thousand
dinner
be
entomb
in
the
sarcophagus
below
it
.
<EOS>
the
owner
of
the
house
live
much
abroad
;
the
air
of
England
seldom
agree
long
with
a
member
of
the
Feenix
family
;
and
the
room
have
gradually
put
itself
into
deep
and
still
deep
mourn
for
him
,
until
it
be
become
so
funereal
as
to
want
nothing
but
a
body
in
it
to
be
quite
complete
.
  
<EOS>
no
bad
representation
of
the
body
,
for
the
nonce
,
in
his
unbend
form
,
if
not
in
his
attitude
,
Mr
Dombey
look
down
into
the
cold
depth
of
the
dead
sea
of
mahogany
on
which
the
fruit
dish
and
decanter
lie
at
anchor
:
as
if
the
subject
of
his
thought
be
rise
towards
the
surface
one
by
one
,
and
plunge
down
again
.
<EOS>
Edith
be
there
in
all
her
majesty
of
brow
and
figure
;
and
close
to
her
come
Florence
,
with
her
timid
head
turn
to
him
,
as
it
have
be
,
for
an
instant
,
when
she
leave
the
room
;
and
Edith
's
eye
upon
her
,
and
Edith
's
hand
put
out
protectingly
.
<EOS>
a
little
figure
in
a
low
arm
-
chair
come
spring
next
into
the
light
,
and
look
upon
him
wonderingly
,
with
its
bright
eye
and
its
old
-
young
face
,
gleam
as
in

the

Florence

perhaps
have

haughty

listless

Captain
Cuttle

by
no

abate
any
of
his
prudent
provision
against
surprise
,
because
of
the
non

appearance
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
the
Captain
argue
that
his
present
security
be
too
profound
and
wonderful
to
endure
much
longer
;
he
know
that
when
the
wind
stand
in
a

quarter

the
weathercock
be
seldom
nail
there
;
and
he
be
too
well
acquaint

dauntless
character
of
Mrs

to
doubt
that
that
heroic
woman

<EOS>
tremble
beneath
the
weight

Captain

live
a
very
close

retired
life

seldom
stir
abroad
until
after
dark
;
venture
even
then
only
into
the
obscure
street
;
never
go
forth
at
all
on
Sundays
;
and
both
within
and
without
the
wall
of
his
retreat
,
avoid
bonnet
,
as
if
they
be
wear
by
rage
lion
.
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
never
dream
that
in
the

it

<EOS>
He
see
himself

meekly

carry
off

<EOS>
He
foresee
that
,
once
immure

he
be
a
lost

Mrs

watchful

reproach
heap
upon
his

before
the
infant

himself
the
guilty
object

suspicion

an
ogre
in
the
child

in

<EOS>
a
violent
perspiration
,
and
a
lowness
of
spirit
always
come
over
the
Captain
as
this
gloomy
picture
present
itself
to
his
imagination

<EOS>
It
generally
do
so
previous
to
his
stealing
out

<EOS>
sensible

to
secure
to
himself
a

of
hold
communication

the
external

Captain

soon
conceive
the
happy
idea

teach
Rob

some
secret
signal
,
by
which
that
adherent
may
make

know
to

in
the
hour

<EOS>
after
much
cogitation

the

decide
in

of
instruct
him
to
whistle
the
marine
melody
,
"

<EOS>
and
Rob
the

attain
a
point

accomplishment

Captain
Cuttle

condescend
,
of
an
evening
after
the
shop
be
shut
,
to
rehearse
this
scene
:
retire
into
the
parlour
for
the
purpose
,
as
into
the
lodging
of
a
supposititious
MacStinger
,
and
carefully
observe
the
behaviour
of
his
ally

from

hole

have
cut
in

wall
.
<EOS>
Rob
the
Grinder
discharge
himself
of
his
duty
with
so
much
exactness
and
judgment
,
when
thus
put
to
the
proof
,
that
the
Captain
present
him
,
at
diver
time
,
with
seven
sixpence
,
in
token
of
satisfaction
;
and
gradually
feel
steal
over
his
spirit
the
resignation
of
a
man
who
have
make
provision
for
the
bad

take
every
reasonable
precaution

an
unrelenting
fate

ministry
of
the
Reverend
Melchisedech
render
it
peculiarly
unlikely
that
she
would
be
find
in
communion
with
the
Establishment
.
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
get
safe
home
again
,
and
fall
into
the
ordinary
routine
of
his
new
life
,
without
encounter
any
more
direct
alarm
from
the
enemy
,
than
be
suggest
to
him
by
the
daily
bonnet
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
but
other
subject
begin
to
lay
heavy
on
the
Captain
's
mind
.
<EOS>
Walter
's
ship
be
still
unheard
of
.
<EOS>
no
news
come
of
old
Sol
Gills
.
<EOS>
Florence
do
not
even
know
of
the
old
man
's
disappearance
,
and
Captain
Cuttle
have
not
the
heart
to
tell
her
.
<EOS>
indeed
the
Captain
,
as
his
own
hope
of
the
generous
,
handsome
,
gallant
-
hearted
youth
,
whom
he
have
love
,
accord
to
his
rough
manner
,
from
a
child
,
begin
to
fade
,
and
fade
more
and
more
from
day
to
day
,
shrink
with
instinctive
pain
from
the
thought
of
exchange
a
word
with
Florence
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
have
good
news
to
carry
to
her
,
the
honest
Captain
would
have
brave
the
newly
decorate
house
and
splendid
furniture
---
though
these
,
connect
with
the
lady
he
have
see
at
church
,
be
awful
to
him
---
and
make
his
away
into
her
presence
.
<EOS>
with
a
dark
horizon
gather
around
their
common
hope
,
however
,
that
darken
every
hour
,
the
Captain
almost
feel
as
if
he
be
a
new
misfortune
and
affliction
to
her
;
and
be
scarcely
less
afraid
of
a
visit
from
Florence
,
than
from
Mrs
MacStinger
herself
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
chill
dark
autumn
evening
,
and
Captain
Cuttle
have
order
a
fire
to
be
kindle
in
the
little
back
parlour
,
now
more
than
ever
like
the
cabin
of
a
ship
.
<EOS>
the
rain
fall
fast
,
and
the
wind
blow
hard
;
and
stray
out
on
the
house
-
top
by
that
stormy
bedroom
of
his
old
friend
,
to
take
an
observation
of
the
weather
,
the
Captain
's
heart
die
within
him
,
when
he
see
how
wild
and
desolate
it
be
.
<EOS>
not
that
he
associate
the
weather
of
that
time
with
poor
Walter
's
destiny
,
or
doubt
that
if
Providence
have
doom
him
to
be
lose
and
shipwreck
,
it
be
over
,
long
ago
;
but
that
beneath
an
outward
influence
,
quite
distinct
from
the
subject
-
matter
of
his
thought
,
the
Captain
's
spirit
sink
,
and
his
hope
turn
pale
,
as
those
of
wise
man
have
often
do
before
him
,
and
will
often
do
again
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
address
his
face
to
the
sharp
wind
and
slant
rain
,
look
up
at
the
heavy
scud
that
be
fly
fast
over
the
wilderness
of
house
-
top
,
and
look
for
something
cheery
there
in
vain
.
<EOS>
the
prospect
near
at
hand
be
no
well
.
<EOS>
in
sundry
tea
-
chest
and
other
rough
box
at
his
foot
,
the
pigeon
of
Rob
the
Grinder
be
coo
like
so
many
dismal
breeze
get
up
.
<EOS>
a
crazy
weathercock
of
a
midshipman
,
with
a
telescope
at
his
eye
,
once
visible
from
the
street
,
but
long
bricke
out
,
creak
and
complain
upon
his
rusty
pivot
as
the
shrill
blast
spin
him
round
and
round
,
and
sport
with
him
cruelly
.
<EOS>
upon
the
Captain
's
coarse
blue
vest
the
cold
raindrop
start
like
steel
bead
;
and
he
could
hardly
maintain
himself
aslant
against
the
stiff
Nor'-Wester
that
come
press
against
him
,
importunate
to
topple
him
over
the
parapet
,
and
throw
him
on
the
pavement
below
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
any
Hope
alive
that
evening
,
the
Captain
think
,
as
he
hold
his
hat
on
,
it
certainly
keep
house
,
and
be
not
out
of
door
;
so
the
Captain
,
shake
his
head
in
a
despondent
manner
,
go
in
to
look
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
descend
slowly
to
the
little
back
parlour
,
and
,
seat
in
his
accustomed
chair
,
look
for
it
in
the
fire
;
but
it
be
not
there
,
though
the
fire
be
bright
.
<EOS>
He
take
out
his
tobacco
-
box
and
pipe
,
and
compose
himself
to
smoke
,
look
for
it
in
the
red
glow
from
the
bowl
,
and
in
the
wreath
of
vapour
that
curl
upward
from
his
lip
;
but
there
be
not
so
much
as
an
atom
of
the
rust
of
Hope
's
anchor
in
either
.
<EOS>
He
try
a
glass
of
grog
;
but
melancholy
truth
be
at
the
bottom
of
that
well
,
and
he
could
not
finish
it
.
<EOS>
He
make
a
turn
or
two
in
the
shop
,
and
look
for
Hope
among
the
instrument
;
but
they
obstinately
work
out
reckoning
for
the
miss
ship
,
in
spite
of
any
opposition
he
could
offer
,
that
end
at
the
bottom
of
the
lone
sea
.
  
<EOS>
the
wind
still
rush
,
and
the
rain
still
patter
,
against
the
closed
shutter
,
the
Captain
bring
to
before
the
Wooden
Midshipman
upon
the
counter
,
and
think
,
as
he
dry
the
little
officer
's
uniform
with
his
sleeve
,
how
many
year
the
Midshipman
have
see
,
during
which
few
change
---
hardly
any
---
have
transpire
among
his
ship
's
company
;
how
the
change
have
come
all
together
,
one
day
,
as
it
may
be
;
and
of
what
a
sweeping
kind
they
be
.
<EOS>
here
be
the
little
society
of
the
back
parlour
break
up
,
and
scatter
far
and
wide
.
<EOS>
here
be
no
audience
for
Lovely
Peg
,
even
if
there
have
be
anybody
to
sing
it
,
which
there
be
not
,
for
the
Captain
be
as
morally
certain
that
nobody
but
he
could
execute
that
ballad
,
as
he
be
that
he
have
not
the
spirit
,
under
exist
circumstance
,
to
attempt
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
bright
face
of
"
Wal'r
"
in
the
house
;
---
here
the
Captain
transfer
his
sleeve
for
a
moment
from
the
Midshipman
's
uniform
to
his
own
cheek
;
---
the
familiar
wig
and
button
of
Sol
Gills
be
a
vision
of
the
past
;
Richard
Whittington
be
knock
on
the
head
;
and
every
plan
and
project
,
in
connexion
with
the
Midshipman
,
lie
drift
,
without
mast
or
rudder
,
on
the
waste
of
water
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
Captain
,
with
a
dejected
face
,
stand
revolve
these
thought
,
and
polish
the
Midshipman
,
partly
in
the
tenderness
of
old
acquaintance
,
and
partly
in
the
absence
of
his
mind
,
a
knocking
at
the
shop
-
door
communicate
a
frightful
start
to
the
frame
of
Rob
the
Grinder
,
seat
on
the
counter
,
whose
large
eye
have
be
intently
fix
on
the
Captain
's
face
,
and
who
have
be
debate
within
himself
,
for
the
five
hundredth
time
,
whether
the
Captain
could
have
do
a
murder
,
that
he
have
such
an
evil
conscience
,
and
be
always
run
away
.
  
<EOS>
"

Captain
Cuttle

softly

<EOS>
"

Rob

<EOS>
the
Captain
,
with
an
abashed
and
guilty
air
,
immediately
sneak
on
tiptoe
to
the
little
parlour
and
lock
himself
in
.
<EOS>
Rob
,
open
the
door
,
would
have
parley
with
the
visitor
on
the
threshold
if
the
visitor

but

Rob
hold
the

glad

from
the

with
a
most
transparent

Mr

shake

then
fall
on

in

shake

in

<EOS>
if
he
reproach
himself
sometimes
,
and
keenly
too
,
for
have
ever
connive
at
Walter

innocent
deceit

he
think
at

as

of
the
Mr

up

as

of
such
decent

respectful
observance
in

forth
with

He
also
provide
Rob
with
a
species

greatly
to
be
admire
for
its
symmetry

as

a
happy
blending
of

which

the

Captain

low

that

half
determine

that
day

to
take
no
further
precaution
against
surprise
from
Mrs

,
but
to
abandon
himself
recklessly
to

as
evening
come

speak
much
of
Walter
to
Rob

whose
attention

fidelity

commend

<EOS>
Rob
do
not
blush
to
hear
the

earnest
in
his
praise

sit
stare
at
him

affect
to
snivel
with
sympathy

make

treasure
up
every

asleep

the

trim

feel
it
appropriate
to
take
to
spectacle
on
enter
into

open
the

softly
to
himself

in

contrast
 
<EOS>
turn
we
our
eye
upon
two
home
;
not
lie
side
by
side
,
but
wide
apart
,
though
both
within
easy
range
and
reach
of
the
great
city
of
London
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
be
situate
in
the
green
and
wooded
country
near
Norwood
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
mansion
;
it
be
of
no
pretension
as
to
size
;
but
it
be
beautifully
arrange
,
and
tastefully
keep
.
<EOS>
the
lawn
,
the
soft
,
smooth
slope
,
the
flower
-
garden
,
the
clump
of
tree
where
graceful
form
of
ash
and
willow
be
not
want
,
the
conservatory
,
the
rustic
verandah
with
sweet
-
smell
creep
plant
entwine
about
the
pillar
,
the
simple
exterior
of
the
house
,
the
well

order
office
,
though
all
upon
the
diminutive
scale
proper
to
a
mere
cottage
,
bespeak
an
amount
of
elegant
comfort
within
,
that
may
serve
for
a
palace
.
<EOS>
this
indication
be
not
without
warrant
;
for
within
it
be
a
house
of
refinement
and
luxury
.
<EOS>
rich
colour
,
excellently
blend
,
meet
the
eye
at
every
turn
;
in
the
furniture
---
its
proportion
admirably
devise
to
suit
the
shape
and
size
of
the
small
room
;
on
the
wall
;
upon
the
floor
;
tinge
and
subdue
the
light
that
come
in
through
the
odd
glass
door
and
window
here
and
there
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
few
choice
print
and
picture
too
;
in
quaint
nook
and
recess
there
be
no
want
of
book
;
and
there
be
game
of
skill
and
chance
set
forth
on
table
---
fantastic
chessman
,
dice
,
backgammon
,
card
,
and
billiard
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
amidst
this
opulence
of
comfort
,
there
be
something
in
the
general
air
that
be
not
well
.
<EOS>
be
it
that
the
carpet
and
the
cushion
be
too
soft
and
noiseless
,
so
that
those
who
move
or
repose
among
them
seem
to
act
by
stealth
?
<EOS>
be
it
that
the
print
and
picture
do
not
commemorate
great
thought
or
deed
,
or
render
nature
in
the
poetry
of
landscape
,
hall
,
or
hut
,
but
be
of
one
voluptuous
cast
---
mere
show
of
form
and
colour
---
and
no
more
?
<EOS>
be
it
that
the
book
have
all
their
gold
outside
,
and
that
the
title
of
the
great
part
qualify
them
to
be
companion
of
the
print
and
picture
?
<EOS>
be
it
that
the
completeness
and
the
beauty
of
the
place
be
here
and
there
belie
by
an
affectation
of
humility
,
in
some
unimportant
and
inexpensive
regard
,
which
be
as
false
as
the
face
of
the
too
truly
paint
portrait
hanging
yonder
,
or
its
original
at
breakfast
in
his
easy
chair
below
it
?
<EOS>
or
be
it
that
,
with
the
daily
breath
of
that
original
and
master
of
all
here
,
there
issue
forth
some
subtle
portion
of
himself
,
which
give
a
vague
expression
of
himself
to
everything
about
him
?
  
<EOS>
It
be
Mr
Carker
the
Manager
who
sit
in
the
easy
chair
.
<EOS>
a
gaudy
parrot
in
a
burnished
cage
upon
the

tear

with
her
beak
,
and
go
walk
,
upside
down
,
in
its
dome
-
top
,
shake
her
house
and
screeching
;
but
Mr
Carker
be
indifferent
to
the
bird
,
and
look
with
a
musing
smile
at
a
picture
on
the
opposite
wall
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
most
extraordinary
accidental
likeness
,
certainly
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
a
Juno
;
perhaps
a
Potiphar

wife
;
perhaps
some
scornful
Nymph
---
<EOS>
accord
as
the
Picture
Dealers
find
the
market
,
when
they
christen
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
figure
of
a
woman
,
supremely
handsome
,
who
,
turn
away
,
but
with
her
face
address
to
the
spectator
,
flash
her
proud
glance
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
like
Edith

<EOS>
with
a
pass
gesture
of
his
hand
at
the
picture
---
what

<EOS>
a
menace
?
<EOS>
no
;
yet
something
like
it

<EOS>
a
wave
as
of
triumph

<EOS>
no
;
yet
more
like
that
.
<EOS>
an
insolent
salute
waft
from
his
lip
?
<EOS>
no
;
yet
like
that
too
---
he
resume
his
breakfast
,
and
call
to
the
chafe
and
imprison
bird
,
who
come
down
into
a
pendant
gild
hoop
within
the
cage
,
like
a
great
wedding

ring
,
swing
in
it

for
his
delight

<EOS>
the

great
north

bygone
day

silent

almost
desert

except
by
wayfarer
who
toil
along
on
foot

<EOS>
It
be

poor

small
house
,
barely
and
sparely
furnished
,
but
very
clean

and
there
be
even
an
attempt
to
decorate
it
,
show

the
homely
flower

about
the
porch
and
in
the
narrow
garden

<EOS>
the

It

among

where

and
where
the
bird

catcher
still
come
occasionally

though

every

no

this

She

his
solitary

after
this
ungrateful
slight

it

though
he

altogether
in

her

It

"
good

bye

dear
John

<EOS>
in
the
evening

at
the
old
time

I
shall
meet
you
as

on
your

home

<EOS>
the
cordial
face

lift
up
to
his
to
kiss
him
,
be
his
home
,
his
life
,
his
universe
,
and
yet
it
be
a
portion
of
his
punishment
and
grief
;
for
in
the
cloud
he
see
upon
it
---
though
serene
and
calm
as
any
radiant
cloud
at
sunset
---
and
<EOS>
in
the
constancy
and
devotion
of
her
life
,
and
in
the
sacrifice
she
have
make
of
ease
,
enjoyment
,
and
hope
,
he
see
the
bitter
fruit
of
his
old
crime
,
for
ever
ripe
and
fresh
.
  
<EOS>
She
stand
at
the
door
look
after
him
,
with
her
hand
loosely
clasp
in
each
other
,
as
he
make
his
way
over
the
frowzy
and
uneven
patch
of
ground
which
lie
before
their
house
,
which
have
once
(
and
not
long
ago
)
be
a
pleasant
meadow
,
and
be
now
a
very
waste
,
with
a
disorderly
crop
of
beginning
of
mean
house
,
rise
out
of
the
rubbish
,
as
if
they
have
be
unskilfully
sow
there
.
<EOS>
whenever
he
look
back
---
<EOS>
as
once
or
twice
he
do
---
<EOS>
her
cordial
face
shine
like
a
light
upon
his
heart
;
but
when
he
plod
on
his
way
,
and
see
her
not
,
the
tear
be
in
her
eye
as
she
stand
watch
him
.
  
<EOS>
Her
pensive
form
be
not
long
idle
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
there
be
daily
duty
to
discharge
,
and
daily
work
to
do
---
for
such
commonplace
spirit
that
be
not
heroic
,
often
work
hard
with
their
hand
---
and
Harriet
be
soon
busy
with
her
household
task
.
<EOS>
these
discharge
,
and
the
poor
house
make
quite
neat
and
orderly
,
she
count
her
little
stock
of
money
,
with
an
anxious
face
,
and
go
out
thoughtfully
to
buy
some
necessary
for
their
table
,
planning
and
contrive
,
as
she
go
,
how
to
save
.
<EOS>
so
sordid
be
the
life
of
such
low
nature
,
who
be
not
only
not
heroic
to
their
valet
and
wait
-
woman
,
but
have
neither
valet
nor
waiting
-
woman
to
be
heroic
to
withal
!
  
<EOS>
while
she
be
absent
,
and
there
be
no
one
in
the
house
,
there
approach
it
by
a
different
way
from
that
the
brother
have
take
,
a
gentleman
,
a
very
little
past
his
prime
of
life
perhaps
,
but
of
a
healthy
florid
hue
,
an
upright
presence
,
and
a
bright
clear
aspect
,
that
be
gracious
and
good
-
humoured
.
<EOS>
His
eyebrow
be
still
black
,
and
so
be
much
of
his
hair
;
the
sprinkling
of
grey
observable
among
the
latter
,
grace
the
former
very
much
,
and
show
his
broad
frank
brow
and
honest
eye
to
great
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
after
knock
once
at
the
door
,
and
obtain
no
response
,
this
gentleman
sit
down
on
a
bench
in
the
little
porch
to
wait
.
<EOS>
a
certain
skilful
action
of
his
finger
as
he
hum
some
bar
,
and
beat
time
on
the
seat
beside
him
,
seem
to
denote
the
musician
;
and
the
extraordinary
satisfaction
he
derive
from
hum
something
very
slow
and
long
,
which
have
no
recognisable
tune
,
seem
to
denote
that
he
be
a
scientific
one
.
  
<EOS>
the
gentleman
be
still
twirl
a
theme
,
which
seem
to
go
round
and
round
and
round
,
and
in
and
in
and
in
,
and
to
involve
itself
like
a
corkscrew
twirl
upon
a
table
,
without
get
any
nearer
to
anything
,
when
Harriet
appear
return
.
<EOS>
He
rise
up
as
she
advance
,
and
stand
with
his
head
uncover

<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
"

that
liberty

"
he
answer
.
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
for
five
minute
of
your
leisure

"
   
<EOS>
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
she
open
the
door
,
and
give
him
admission
to
the
little
parlour
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
sit
down
there
,
draw
his
chair
to
the
table
over
against
her
,
and
say
,
in
a
voice
that
perfectly
correspond
to
his
appearance
,
and
with
a
simplicity
that
be
very
engaging
:
  
"
<EOS>
Miss
Harriet
,
you
can
not

<EOS>
You

gently
on

an
instant

contradict
you
more

"
  
<EOS>
She
be
somewhat
confused
and
agitate
,
and
could
make
no
ready
answer

mirror

<EOS>
His
manner
of
say
these
word
,
divest
them
entirely
of
the
character
of
compliment
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
plain
,
grave
,
unaffected
,
and
sincere
,
that
she
bend
her
head
,
as
if
at
once
to
thank
him
,
and
acknowledge
his
sincerity

I

your
forgiveness

the
visitor

I

know
it

entreat

you

so

many

awaken
in
the
sister

mind
by
this
visit

<EOS>
It
be
so
very
long
since
any
other
visitor
have
cross
their
threshold
;
it
be
so
very
long

any
voice
of
sympathy

make
sad
music
in

ear

that
the

He

touch
the

bright

overcast

sharp
wind

the
rain
fall
heavily
;
and
a
dark
mist
droop
over
the
distant
town

hide
it
from
the
view

<EOS>
She
often
look
with
compassion
,
at
such
a
time
,
upon
the
straggler
who
come
wander
into
London
,
by
the
great
highway
hard
by
,
and
who
,
footsore
and
weary
,
and
gaze
fearfully
at
the
huge
town
before
them

as
if
forebode
that
their
misery
there
would
be

as
a
drop

shrink

raise
her

from

work

have
long

engage
with
unremitting
constancy
,
see
one
of
these
traveller
approach
.
  
<EOS>
a
woman
.
<EOS>
a
solitary
woman
of
some
thirty
year
of
age
;
tall
;
well
form
;
handsome
;
miserably
dressed
;
the
soil
of
many
country
road
in
varied
weather
---
dust
,
chalk
,
clay
,
gravel
---
clot
on
her
grey
cloak
by
the
streaming
wet
;
no
bonnet
on
her
head
,
nothing
to
defend
her
rich
black
hair
from
the
rain
,
but
a
torn
handkerchief
;
with
the
flutter
end
of
which
,
and
with
her
hair
,
the
wind
blind
her
so
that
she
often
stop
to
push
them
back
,
and
look
upon
the
way
she
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
in
the
act
of
do
so
,
when
Harriet
observe
her
.
<EOS>
as
her
hand
,
part
on
her
sunburnt
forehead
,
sweep
across
her
face
,
and
throw
aside
the
hindrance
that
encroach
upon
it
,
there
be
a
reckless
and
regardless
beauty
in
it
:
a
dauntless
and
depraved
indifference
to
more
than
weather
:
a
carelessness
of
what
be
cast
upon
her
bare
head
from
Heaven
or
earth
:
that
couple
with
her
misery
and
loneliness
,
touch
the
heart
of
her
fellow
-
woman
.
<EOS>
She
think
of
all
that
be
pervert
and
debase
within
her
,
no
less
than
without
:
of
modest
grace
of
the
mind
,
harden
and
steel
,
like
these
attraction
of
the
person
:
of
the
many
gift
of
the
Creator
fling
to
the
wind
like
the
wild
hair
;
of
all
the
beautiful
ruin
upon
which
the
storm
be
beat
and
the
night
be
come
.
  
<EOS>
think
of
this
,
she
do
not
turn
away
with
a
delicate
indignation
---
too
many
of
her
own
compassionate
and
tender
sex
too
often
do
---
but
pity
her
.
  
<EOS>
Her
fall
sister
come
on
,
look
far
before
her
,
try
with
her
eager
eye
to
pierce
the
mist
in
which
the
city
be
enshroud
,
and
glance
,
now
and
then
,
from
side
to
side
,
with
the
bewildered
and
uncertain
aspect
of
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
though
her
tread
be
bold
and
courageous
,
she
be
fatigue
,
and
after
a
moment
of
irresolution
,
sit
down
upon
a
heap
of
stone
;
seek
no
shelter
from
the
rain
,
but
let
it
rain
on
her
as
it
would
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
now
opposite
the
house
;
raise
her
head
after
rest
it
for
a
moment
on
both
hand
,
her
eye
meet
those
of
Harriet
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
moment
,
Harriet
be
at
the
door
:
and
the
other
,
rise
from
her
seat
at
her
beck
,
come
slowly
,
and
with
no
conciliatory
look
,
towards
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
rest
in
the
rain
?
"
say
Harriet
,
gently
.
  
<EOS>
"
because
I
have
no
other
resting
-
place
,
"
be
the
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
there
be
many
place
of

this
,

"
be
well

<EOS>
You
be
very
welcome
to
rest
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
wanderer
look
at
her
,
in
doubt
and
surprise
,
but
without
any
expression
of
thankfulness
;
and
sit
down
,
and
take
off
one
of
her
worn
shoe
to
beat
out
the
fragment
of
stone
and
dust
that
be
inside
,
show
that
her
foot
be
cut
and
bleed
.
  
<EOS>
Harriet
utter
an
expression
of
pity
,
the
traveller
look
up
with
a
contemptuous
and
incredulous
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
what
be
a
torn
foot
to
such
as
me
?
<EOS>
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
and
what
be
a
torn
foot
in
such
as
me
,
to
such
as
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
come
in
and
wash
it
,
"
answer
Harriet
,
mildly
,
"
and
let
me
give
you
something
to
bind
it
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
woman
catch
her
arm
,
and
draw
it
before
her
own
eye
,
hide
them
against
it
,
and
weep
.
<EOS>
not
like
a
woman
,
but
like
a
stern
man
surprise
into
that
weakness
;
with
a
violent
heaving
of
her
breast
,
and
struggle
for
recovery
,
that
show
how
unusual
the
emotion
be
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
submit
to
be
lead
into
the
house
,
and
,
evidently
more
in
gratitude
than
in
any
care
for
herself
,
wash
and
bind
the
injured
place
.
<EOS>
Harriet
then
put
before
her
fragment
of
her
own
frugal
dinner
,
and
when
she
have
eat
of
them
,
though
sparingly
,
besought
her
,
before
resume
her
road
(
which
she
show
her
anxiety
to
do
)
,
to
dry
her
clothe
before
the
fire
.
<EOS>
again
,
more
in
gratitude
than
with
any
evidence
of
concern
in
her
own
behalf
,
she
sit
down
in
front
of
it
,
and
unbind
the
handkerchief
about
her
head
,
and
let
her
thick
wet
hair
fall
down
below
her
waist
,
sit
dry
it
with
the
palm
of
her
hand
,
and
look
at
the
blaze
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
you
be

"
she
say
,
lift
her
head
suddenly
,
"
that
I

be
handsome

once

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
look
here

"
   
<EOS>
She
hold
up
her
hair
roughly
with
both
hand
;
seize
it
as
if
she
would
have
tear
it
out
;
then
,
throw
it
down
again
,
and
fling
it
back
as
though
it
be
a
heap
of
serpent
.
  
<EOS>
"
be

ask
Harriet

she

nod
her
head
at

fire

"
if

some

a
little
more

God

<EOS>
but
she
be
soften
by
the
earnest
manner
,
and
the
cordial
face
so
full
of
mildness
and
so
free
from
judgment

of
her

and

less
hardily

We

two

oh

"
  
<EOS>
She
open
her
arm
,
as
though
the
exhibition
of
her
outward
form
would
show
the
moral
wretch
she
be

and

drop
at
her
side

down

"
there

many
flower
in
their
happy
path
,
that
they
can
scarcely
move
along
,
without
entanglement
in
thornless
rose
,
and
sweetest
briar
?
  
<EOS>
They
be
here
at
last
!
<EOS>
the
noise
of
wheel
be
hear
,
grow
louder
,
and
a
carriage
drive
up
to
the
door
!
<EOS>
a
thundering
knock
from
the
obnoxious
foreigner
anticipate
the
rush
of
Mr
Towlinson
and
party
to
open
it
;
and
Mr
Dombey
and
his
bride
alight
,
and
walk
in
arm
in
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
sweetest
Edith

"
cry
an
agitated
voice
upon
the
stair
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
dombey
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
short
sleeve
wreath
themselves
about
the
happy
couple
in
turn
,
and
embrace
them
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
have
come
down
to
the
hall
too
,
but
do
not
advance
:
reserve
her
timid
welcome
until
these
nearer
and
dearer
transport
should
subside
.
<EOS>
but
the
eye
of
Edith
seek
her
out
,
upon
the
threshold
;
and
dismiss
her
sensitive
parent
with
a
slight
kiss
on
the
cheek
,
she
hurry
on
to
Florence
and
embrace
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
do
,
Florence
?
"
say
Mr
Dombey
,
put
out
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
as
Florence
,
tremble
,
raise
it
to
her
lip
,
she
meet
his
glance
.
<EOS>
the
look
be
cold
and
distant
enough
,
but
it
stir
her
heart
to
think
that
she
observe
in
it
something
more
of
interest
than
he
have
ever
show
before
.
<EOS>
It
even
express
a
kind
of
faint
surprise
,
and
not
a
disagreeable
surprise
,
at
sight
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
dare
not
raise
her
eye
to
his
any
more
;
but
she
feel
that
he
look
at
her
once
again
,
and
hot
less
favourably
.
<EOS>
oh
what
a
thrill
of
joy
shoot
through
her
,
awaken
by
even
this
intangible
and
baseless
confirmation
of
her
hope
that
she
would
learn
to
win
him
,
through
her
new
and
beautiful
mama
!
  
<EOS>
"
You

away
to
his

upstairs
to

<EOS>
Mrs

a
few
irrepressible

suppose
to

force
from

which
she

still
dry

very
gingerly

I

She

Edith

<EOS>
"
My

Mrs

"
how
charmingly
these
people
have
carry
out

that

They

haughty
carelessness

<EOS>
"
They
should
be
so
,
of
course

<EOS>
and
I
suppose
they
be

"
  
<EOS>
an
expression
of
scorn
be
habitual
to
the
proud
face
,
and
seem
inseparable
from
it
;
but
the
contempt
with
which
it
receive
any
appeal
to
admiration
,
respect
,
or
consideration
on
the
ground
of
his
rich
,
no
matter
how
slight
or
ordinary
in
itself
,
be
a
new
and
different
expression
,
unequalle
in
intensity
by
any
other
of
which
it
be
capable

<EOS>
whether
Mr

wrap
in
his

be
at
all
aware
of
this
,
or
no

there
have
not

opportunity
already
for
his
complete
enlightenment

and
at
that
moment
it
may
have
be
effect
by
the
one
glance
of
the
dark
eye
that
light
on
him
,
after
it
have
rapidly
and
scornfully
survey
the
theme
of
his
self
-
glorification
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
read
in
that
one
glance
that
nothing
that
his
wealth
could
do
,
though
it
be
increase
ten
thousand
fold
,
could
win
him
for
its
own
sake
,
one
look
of
softened
recognition
from
the
defiant
woman
,
link
to
him
,
but
array
with
her
whole
soul
against
him

<EOS>
He
may
have
read
in
that
one
glance
that
even
for
its
sordid
and
mercenary
influence
upon
herself
,
she
spurn
it
,
while
she
claim
its
utmost
power
as
her
right
,
her
bargain
---
as
the
base
and
worthless
recompense
for
which
she
have
become
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
read
in
it
that
,
ever
bare
her
own
head
for
the
lightning
of
her
own
contempt
and
pride
to
strike
,
the
most
innocent
allusion
to
the
power
of

her
anew
,
sunk
her
deeper
in

respect
,
and
make
the
blight

waste
within
her
more
complete

<EOS>
but
dinner
be
announce
,
and
Mr
Dombey
lead
down
Cleopatra
;
Edith
and
his
daughter
follow
.
<EOS>
sweep
past
the
gold
and
silver
demonstration
on
the
sideboard
as
if
it
be
heap
-
up
dirt
,
and
deign
to
bestow
no
look
upon
the
elegancie
around
her
,
she
take
her
place
at
his
board
for
the
first
time
,
and
sit
,
like
a
statue
,
at
the
feast
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
,
be
a
good
deal
in
the
statue
way
himself
,
be
well
enough
pleased
to
see
his
handsome
wife
immovable
and
proud
and
cold
.
<EOS>
Her
deportment
be
always
elegant
and
graceful
,
this
as
a
general
behavior
be
agreeable
and
congenial
to
him
.
<EOS>
preside
,
therefore
,
with
his
accustomed
dignity
,
and
not
at
all
reflect
on
his
wife
by
any
warmth
or
hilarity
of
his

he
perform
his
share
of
the
honour
of
the
table
with
a
cool
satisfaction
;
and
the

,
though
not
regard
downstairs
as
a
great
success
,
or
very
promising
beginning
,
pass
off
,
above
,
in
a
sufficiently
polite
,
genteel
,
and
frosty
manner
.
  
<EOS>
soon
after
tea
,
Mrs
Skewton
,
who
affect
to
be
quite
overcome
and
wear
out
by
her
emotion
of
happiness
,
arise
in
the
contemplation
of
her
dear
child
unite
to
the
man
of
her
heart
,
but
who
,
there
be
reason
to
suppose
,
find
this
family
party
somewhat
dull
,
as
she
yawn
for
one
hour
continually
behind
her
fan
,
retire
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Edith
,
also
,
silently
withdraw
and
come
back
no
more
.
<EOS>
thus
,
it
happen
that
Florence
,
who
have
be
upstairs
to
have
some
conversation
with
Diogenes
,
return
to
the
drawing
-
room
with
her
little
work
-
basket
,
find
no
one
there
but
her
father
,
who
be
walk
to
and
fro
,
in
dreary
magnificence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
go
away
,
papa
?
"
say
Florence
faintly
,
hesitate
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
return
Mr
Dombey
,
look
round
over
his
shoulder
;
"
you
can
come
and
go
here
,
Florence
,
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
my
private
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
enter
,
and
sit
down
at
a
distant
little
table
with
her
work
:
find
herself
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
---
for
the
very
first
time
within
her
memory
from
her
infancy
to
that
hour
---
alone
with
her
father
,
as
his
companion
.
<EOS>
She
,
his
natural
companion
,
his
only
child
,
who
in
her
lonely
life
and
grief
have
know
the
suffering
of
a
break
heart
;
who
,
in
her
reject
love
,
have
never
breathe
his
name
to
God
at
night
,
but
with
a
tearful
blessing
,
heavier
on
him
than
a
curse
;
who
have
pray
to
die
young
,
so
she
may
only
die
in
his
arm
;
who
have
,
all
through
,
repay
the
agony
of
slight
and
coldness
,
and
dislike
,
with
patient
unexacting
love
,
excuse
him
,
and
plead
for
him
,
like
his
well
angel
!
  
<EOS>
She
tremble
,
and
her
eye
be
dim
.
<EOS>
His
figure
seem
to
grow
in
height
and
bulk
before
her
as
he
pace
the
room
:
now
it
be
all
blurred
and
indistinct
;
now
clear
again
,
and
plain
;
and
now
she
seem
to
think
that
this
have
happen
,
just
the
same
,
a
multitude
of
year
ago
.
<EOS>
She
yearn
towards
him
,
and
yet
shrink
from
his
approach
.
<EOS>
unnatural
emotion
in
a
child
,
innocent
of
wrong
!
<EOS>
unnatural
the
hand
that
have
direct
the
sharp
plough
,
which
furrow
up
her
gentle
nature
for
the
sowing
of
its
seed
!
  
<EOS>
bent
upon
not
distress
or
offend
him
by
her
distress
,
Florence
control
herself
,
and
sit
quietly
at
her
work
.
<EOS>
after
a
few
more
turn
across
and
across
the
room
,
he
leave
off
pace
it
;
and
withdraw
into
a
shadowy
corner
at
some
distance
,
where
there
be
an
easy
chair
,
cover
his
head
with
a
handkerchief
,
and
compose
himself
to
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
enough
for
Florence
to
sit
there
watch
him
;
turn
her
eye
towards
his
chair
from
time
to
time
;
watch
him
with
her
thought
,
when
her
face
be
intent
upon
her
work
;
and
sorrowfully
glad
to
think
that
he
could
sleep
,
while
she
be
there
,
and
that
he
be
not
make
restless
by
her
strange
and
long
-
forbid
presence
.
  
<EOS>
what
would
have
be
her
thought
if
she
have
know
that
he
be
steadily
regard
her
;
that
the
veil
upon
his
face
,
by
accident
or
by
design
,
be
so
adjusted
that
his
sight
be
free
,
and
that
it
never
wander
from
her
face
an
instant
!
<EOS>
that
when
she
look
towards
him
,
in
the
obscure
dark
corner
,
her
speak
eye
,
more
earnest
and
pathetic
in
their
voiceless
speech
than
all
the
orator
of
all
the
world
,
and
impeach
him
more
nearly
in
their
mute
address
,
meet
his
,
and
do
not
know
it
!
<EOS>
that
when
she
bend
her
head
again
over
her
work
,
he
draw
his
breath
more
easily
,
but
with
the
same
attention
look
upon
her
still
---
upon
her
white
brow
and
her
fall
hair
,
and
busy
hand
;
and
once
attract
,
seem
to
have
no
power
to
turn
his
eye
away
!
  
<EOS>
and
what
be
his
thought
meanwhile
?
<EOS>
with
what
emotion
do
he
prolong
the
attentive
gaze
covertly
direct
on
his
unknown
daughter
?
<EOS>
be
there
reproach
to
him
in
the
quiet
figure
and
the
mild
eye
?
<EOS>
have
he
begin
to
feel
her
disregard
claim
,
and
do
they
touch
him
home
at
last
,
and
waken
him
to
some
sense
of
his
cruel
injustice
?
  
<EOS>
there
be
yield
moment
in
the
life
of
the
stern
and
harsh
man
,
though
such
man
often
keep
their
secret
well
.
<EOS>
the
sight
of
her
in
her
beauty
,
almost
change
into
a
woman
without
his
knowledge
,
may
have
strike
out
some
such
moment
even
in
his
life
of
pride
.
<EOS>
some
pass
think
that
he
have
have
a
happy
home
within
his
reach
---
have
have
a
household
spirit
bend
at
his
foot
---
have
overlook
it
in
his
stiffnecked
sullen
arrogance
,
and
wander
away
and
lose
himself
,
may
have
engender
them
.
<EOS>
some
simple
eloquence
distinctly
hear
,
though
only
utter
in
her
eye
,
unconscious
that
he
read
them
,
as
"
by
the
death
-
bed
I
have
tend
,
by
the
childhood
I
have
suffer
,
by
our
meeting
in
this
dreary
house
at
midnight
,
by
the
cry
wrung
from
me
in
the
anguish
of
my
heart
,
oh
,
father
,
turn
to
me
and
seek
a
refuge
in
my
love
before
it
be
too
late
!
"
may
have
arrest
them
.
<EOS>
mean
and
low
thought
,
as
that
his
dead
boy
be
now
supersede
by
new
tie
,
and
he
could
forgive
the
having
be
supplant
in
his
affection
,
may
have
occasion
them
.
<EOS>
the
mere
association
of
her
as
an
ornament
,
with
all
the
ornament
and
pomp
about
him
,
may
have
be
sufficient
.
<EOS>
but
as
he
look
,
he
soften
to
her
,
more
and
more
.
<EOS>
as
he
look
,
she
become
blended
with
the
child
he
have
love
,
and
he
could
hardly
separate
the
two
.
<EOS>
as
he
look
,
he
see
her
for
an
instant
by
a
clear
and
a
bright
light
,
not
bend
over
that
child
's
pillow
as
his
rival
---
monstrous
thought
---
<EOS>
but
as
the
spirit
of
his
home
,
and
in
the
action
tend
himself
no
less
,
as
he
sit
once
more
with
his
bow
-
down
head
upon
his
hand
at
the
foot
of
the
little
bed
.
<EOS>
He
feel
inclined
to
speak
to
her
,

to
his
lip
---
but
slowly
and
with
difficulty
,
they
be
so
very
strange
---
when
they
be
check
and
stifle
by
a
footstep
on
the
stair
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
his
wife
's
.
<EOS>
She
have
exchange
her
dinner
dress
for
a
loose
robe
,
and
unbound
her
hair
,
which
fall
freely
about
her
neck
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
the
change
in
her
that
startle
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Florence
,
dear
,
"
she
say
,
"
I
have
be

for
you
everywhere

"
  
<EOS>
as
she
sit
down
by
the
side
of
Florence
,
she
stoop
and
kiss
her
hand
.
<EOS>
He
hardly
know
his
wife
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
change
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
merely
that
her
smile
be
new
to
him
---
though
that
he
have
never
see
:
but
her
manner
,
the
tone
of
her
voice
,
the
light
of
her
eye
,
the
interest
,
and
confidence
,
and
win
wish
to
please
,
express
in
all
<EOS>
---
this
be
not
Edith

<EOS>
"
softly
,

Mama

<EOS>
Papa

asleep

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
Edith
now
.
<EOS>
She
look
towards
the
corner
where
he
be
,
and
he
know
that
face
and
manner
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
scarcely
think
you
could
be
here
,
Florence
.
"
  
<EOS>
again
,
how
altered
and
how
soften
,
in
an
instant
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
leave
here
early
,
"
pursue
Edith
,
"
purposely
to
sit
up
stair
and
talk
with
you
.
<EOS>
but
,
go
to
your
room
,
I
find
my
bird
be
fly
,
and
I
have
be
wait
there
ever
since

its

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
if
it
have
be
a
bird
,
indeed
,
she
could
not
have
take
it
more
tenderly
and
gently
to
her
breast
,
than
she
do
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
dear
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
will
not
expect
to

I

<EOS>
"
do
you

Edith

look
full
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
droop
her
head
,
and
rise
,
and
put
up
her
workbasket
.
<EOS>
Edith
draw
her
hand
through
her
arm
,
and
they
go
out
of
the
room
like
sister
.
<EOS>
Her
very
step
be
different
and
new
to
him
,
Mr
Dombey
think
,
as
his
eye
follow
her
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
He
sit
in
his
shadowy
corner
so
long
,
that
the
church
clock
strike
the
hour
three
time
before
he
move
that
night
.
<EOS>
all
that
while
his
face
be
still
intent
upon
the
spot
where
Florence
have

<EOS>
the
room
grow
dark
,
as
the
candle
wane
and
go
out

but
a
darkness
gather
on
his

exceed
any
that
the
night

and
rest
there

<EOS>
Florence
and
Edith

seat
before
the
fire
in
the
remote
room
where
little
Paul

together
for
a
long
time

<EOS>
diogene

who
be
of
the
party

have
at
first
object
to
the
admission
of
Edith

and
,
even
in
deference
to
his
mistress
's
wish
,
have
only
permit
it
under
growl
protest

<EOS>
but
,
emerge
by
little
and
little
from
the
ante

room
,
whither
he
have
retire
in
dudgeon
,
he
soon
appear
to
comprehend
,
that
with
the
most
amiable
intension
he
have
make
one
of
those
mistake
which
will
occasionally
arise
in
the
best

regulate
dog

as
a
friendly
apology
for
which
he
stick
himself
up
on
end
between
the

in
a
very
hot
place
in

of
the
fire
,
and
sit
pant
at
it
,
with
his
tongue
out
,
and
a
most
imbecile
expression
of
countenance
,
listen
to
the
conversation

<EOS>
It
turn
,
at
first
,
on
Florence

and
on
the
manner
in

the
interval
since
the
marriage

<EOS>
the
last
theme
open
up
to
her
a
subject
which
lie
very
near

she

,
with
the

her
eye
:

Pale

so
check

in

in
this

Florence

on
the
first
night

my
taking
up
my

here

I
be
lead
on
as
it
be
good
I
should
be

Florence
,
without
know
why

feel
almost
afraid
to
hear
her
proceed
,
but
keep
her
eye
rivet
on
the
beautiful
face
so
fix
upon
her
own

<EOS>
"
never

lay
her

upon

"
what

never

you
can
help
it

fall
off
from

<EOS>
little
by
little
you
will
know
me
better
,
and
the
time
will
come
when
you
will
know
me

as
I
know
myself

<EOS>
then
,
be
as
lenient
to
me
as
you
can
,
and
do
not
turn
to
bitterness
the
only
sweet
remembrance
I
shall
have
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
tear
that
be
visible
in
her
eye
as
she
keep
them
fix
on
Florence
,
show
that
the
compose
face
be
but
as
a
handsome
mask
;
but
she
preserve
it
,
and
continue
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
what
you
say
,
and
know
how
true
it
be

<EOS>
but
believe
me

you
will
soon
,
if
you
can
not
now
---
there
be
no
one
on
this
earth
less
qualified
to
set
it
right
or
help
you
,
Florence

than
I.
never
ask
me
why
,
or
speak
to
me
about
it
or
of
my
husband
,
more
.
<EOS>
there
should
be
,
so
far
,
as
division
,
and
a
silence
between
us
two
,
like
the
grave
itself
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
sit
for
some
time
silent
;
Florence
scarcely
venture
to
breathe
meanwhile
,
as
dim
and
imperfect
shadow
of
the
truth
,
and
all
its
daily
consequence
,
chase
each
other
through
her
terrified
,
yet
incredulous
imagination
.
<EOS>
almost
as
soon
as
she
have
cease
to
speak
,
Edith
's
face
begin
to
subside
from
its
set
composure
to
that
quieter
and
more
relent
aspect
,
which
it
usually
wear
when
she
and
Florence
be
alone
together
.
<EOS>
She
shade
it
,
after
this
change
,
with
her
hand
;
and
when
she
arise
,
and
with
an
affectionate
embrace
bade
Florence
good
night
,
go
quickly
,
and
without
look
round
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
Florence
be
in
bed
,
and
the
room
be
dark
except
for
the
glow
of
the
fire
,
Edith
return
,
and
say
that
she
could
not
sleep
,
and
that
her
dressing
-
room
be
lonely
,
draw
a
chair
upon
the
hearth
,
and
watch
the
ember
as
they
die
away
.
<EOS>
Florence
watch
them
too
from
her
bed
,
until
they
,
and
the
noble
figure
before
them
,
crown
with
its
flow
hair
,
and
in
its
thoughtful
eye
reflect
back
their
light
,
become
confused
and
indistinct
,
and
finally
be
lose
in
slumber
.
  
<EOS>
in
her
sleep
,
however
,
Florence
could
not
lose
an
undefined
impression
of
what
have
so
recently
pass
.
<EOS>
It
form
the
subject
of
her
dream
,
and
haunt
her
;
now
in
one
shape
,
now
in
another
;
but
always
oppressively
;
and
with
a
sense
of
fear
.
<EOS>
She
dream
of
seek
her
father
in
wilderness
,
of
follow
his
track
up
fearful
height
,
and
down
into
deep
mine
and
cavern
;
of
be
charge
with
something
that
would
release
him
from
extraordinary
suffering
---
she
know
not
what
,
or
why
---
yet
never
be
able
to
attain
the
goal
and
set
him
free
.
<EOS>
then
she
see
him
dead
,
upon
that
very
bed
,
and
in
that
very
room
,
and
know
that
he
have
never
love
her
to
the
last
,
and
fall
upon
his
cold
breast
,
passionately
weep
.
<EOS>
then
a
prospect
open
,
and
a
river
flow
,
and
a
plaintive
voice
she
know
,
cry
,
"
It
be
run
on
,
Floy
!
<EOS>
It
have
never
stop
!
<EOS>
You
be
move
with
it
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
see
him
at
a
distance
stretch
out
his
arm
towards
her
,
while
a
figure
such
as
Walter
's
use
to
be
,
stand
near
him
,
awfully
serene
and
still
.
<EOS>
in
every
vision
,
Edith
come
and
go
,
sometimes
to
her
joy
,
sometimes
to
her
sorrow
,
until
they
be
along
upon
the
brink
of
a
dark
grave
,
and
Edith
point
down
,
she
look
and
see
---
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
another
Edith
lie
at
the
bottom
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
terror
of
this
dream
,
she
cry

that

nor

proud

her
<EOS>

Florence
could
not

observe

<EOS>
Florence
,
who
have
hope
for
so
much
from
this
marriage
,
could
not
help
sometimes
compare
the
bright
house
with
the
fade
dreary
place
out
of
which
it
have
arise
,
and
wonder
when
,
in
any
shape
,
it
would
begin
to
be
a
home
;
for
that
it
be
no
home
then

for

though
everything
go
on
luxuriously

she
have
always
a

misgiving

<EOS>
many
an
hour
of
sorrowful
reflection
by
day

night
,
and
many
a
tear
of
blight
hope
,
Florence
bestow
upon
the
assurance
her
new
mama
have
give
her
so
strongly
,
that
there
be
no
one
on
the
earth
more
powerless
than
herself
to
teach
her
how
to
win
her
father
's
heart
.
<EOS>
and
soon
Florence
begin
to
think
---
resolve
to
think
would
be
the
truer
phrase
<EOS>
---
that
as
no
one
know
so
well
,
how
hopeless
of
be
subdue
or
change
her
father
's
coldness
to
her
be
,
so
she
have
give
her
this
warning
,
and
forbid
the
subject
in
very
compassion
.
<EOS>
Unselfish
here
,
as
in
her
every
act
and
fancy
,
Florence
prefer
to
bear
the
pain
of
this
new
wound
,
rather
than
encourage
any
faint
foreshadowing
of
the
truth
as
it
concern
her
father
;
tender
of
him
,
even
in
her
wander
thought

<EOS>
as
for
his
home
,
she
hope
it
would
become
a
well
one
,
when
its
state
of
novelty
and
transition
should
be
over
;
and
for
herself
,
think
little
and
lament
less
.
  
<EOS>
if
none
of
the
new

particularly
at

it

uponThames

and
its
just

say
,
it
be
not
for
a
man
who
live
in
his
quiet
way
to
take
upon
himself
to
invite
---
but
if
Mrs
Skewton
and
her
daughter
,
Mrs
Dombey
,
should
ever
find
themselves
in
that
direction
,
and
would
do

the
honour
to

little
bit

a
shrubbery

would
find
there
,
and
a
poor
little
flower

bed
or
so
,
and
a
humble
apology
for
a
pinery
,
and
two
or
three
little

too
loose

and
a
pair
of

that
be
too
spare
;
and
mention
be

of
the
Opera
by
Mrs

he

he
very
seldom
go
there

for
he

<EOS>
It
seem
greatly
to
delight

exhilarate
him
to

so

on
his
audience
afterwards

with
his
hand
in
his
pocket

and
excessive
satisfaction

in
his
eye

now
Mrs

beautiful

<EOS>
now
,
this

in
point

the
marriage

an
uncommonly
fine

with
a
man

whom
she

but
whom
she
accept
on
account
of
his
property

which
be
immense

It

She

"
<EOS>
"
  
in
his
full
enjoyment
of
this
culminate
point
of
his
story
,
the
shudder
,
which
have
go
all
round
the
table
like
an
electric
spark
,
strike
Cousin
Feenix
,
and
he
stop
.
<EOS>
not

the
only
general
topic
of
conversation
broach
that
day
,
appear
on
any
face
.
<EOS>
a
profound
silence
ensue
;
and
the
wretched
mild
man
,
who
have
be
as
innocent
of
any
real
foreknowledge
of
the
story
as
the
child
unborn
,
have
the
exquisite
misery
of
read
in
every
eye
that
he
be
regard
as
the
prime
mover
of
the
mischief

<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
's
face
be
a
changeful
one
,
and
be
cast
in
its
mould
of
state
that
day
,
show
litter
other
apprehension
of
the
story
,
if
any
,
than
that
which
he
express
when
he
say
solemnly
,
amidst
the
silence
,
that
it
be
"
very
good
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
rapid
glance
from
Edith
towards
Florence
,
but
otherwise
she
remain
,
externally
,
impassive
and
unconscious
.
  
<EOS>
through
the
various
stage
of
rich
meat
and
wine
,
continual
gold
and
silver
,
dainty
of
earth
,
air
,
fire
,
and
water
,
heap
-
up
fruit
,
and
that
unnecessary
article
in
Mr
Dombey
's
banquet
---
ice
---
the
dinner
slowly
make
its
way
:
the
later
stage
be
achieve
to
the
sonorous
music
of
incessant
double
knock
,
announce
the
arrival
of
visitor
,
whose
portion
of
the
feast
be
limit
to
the
smell
thereof
.
<EOS>
when
Mrs
Dombey
rise
,
it
be
a
sight
to
see
her
lord
,
with
stiff
throat
and
erect
head
,
hold
the
door
open
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
lady
;
and
to
see
how
she
sweep
past
him
with
his
daughter
on
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
be
a
grave
sight
,
be
the
decanter
,
in
a
state
of
dignity
;
and
the
East
India
Director
be
a
forlorn
sight
near
the
unoccupied
end
of
the
table
,
in
a
state
of
solitude
;
and
the
Major
be
a
military
sight
,
relate
story
of
the
Duke
of
York
to
six
of
the
seven
mild
man
(
the
ambitious
one
be
utterly
quench
)
;
and
the
Bank
Director
be
a
lowly
sight
,
make
a
plan
of
his
little
attempt
at
a
pinery
,
with
dessertknive
,
for
a
group
of
admirer
;
and
Cousin
Feenix
be
a
thoughtful
sight
,
as
he
smooth
his
long
wristband
and
stealthily
adjust
his
wig
.
<EOS>
but
all
these
sight
be
of
short
duration
,
be
speedily
break
up
by
coffee
,
and
the
desertion
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
throng
in
the
state
-
room
upstairs
,
increase
every
minute
;
but
still
Mr
Dombey
's
list
of
visitor
appear
to
have
some
native
impossibility
of
amalgamation
with
Mrs
Dombey
's
list
,
and
no
one
could
have
doubt
which
be
which
.
<EOS>
the
single
exception
to
this
rule
perhaps
be
Mr
Carker
,
who
now
smile
among
the
company
,
and
who
,
as
he
stand
in
the
circle
that
be
gather
about
Mrs
Dombey
---
watchful
of
her
,
of
them
,
his
chief
,
Cleopatra
and
the
Major
,
Florence
,
and
everything
around
---
appear
at
ease
with
both
division
of
guest
,
and
not
mark
as
exclusively
belong
to
either
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
have
a
dread
of
him
,
which
make
his
presence
in
the
room
a
nightmare
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
avoid
the
recollection
of
it
,
for
her
eye
be
draw
towards
him
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
by
an
attraction
of
dislike
and
distrust
that
she
could
not
resist
.
<EOS>
yet
her
thought
be
busy
with
other
thing
;
for
as
she
sit
apart
---
not
unadmired
or
unsought
,
but
in
the
gentleness
of
her
quiet
spirit
---
she
feel
how
little
part
her
father
have
in
what
be
go
on
,
and
see
,
with
pain
,
how
ill
at
ease
he
seem
to
be
,
and
how
little
regard
he
be
as
he
linger
about
near
the
door
,
for
those
visitor
whom
he
wish
to
distinguish
with
particular
attention
,
and
take
them
up
to
introduce
them
to
his
wife
,
who
receive
them
with
proud
coldness
,
but
show
no
interest
or
wish
to
please
,
and
never
,
after
the
bare
ceremony
of
reception
,
in
consultation
of
his
wish
,
or
in
welcome
of
his
friend
,
open
her
lip
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
less
perplexing
or
painful
to
Florence
,
that
she
who
act
thus
,
treat
her
so
kindly
and
with
such
loving
consideration
,
that
it
almost
seem
an
ungrateful
return
on
her
part
even
to
know
of
what
be
pass
before
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Happy
Florence
would
have
be
,
may
she
have
venture
to
bear
her
father
company
,
by
so
much
as
a
look
:
and
happy
Florence
be
,
in
little
suspect
the
main
cause
of
his
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
but
afraid
of
seem
to
know
that
he
be
place
at
any
disadvantage
,
lest
he
should
be
resentful
of
that
knowledge
;
and
divide
between
her
impulse
towards
him
,
and
her
grateful
affection
for
Edith
<EOS>
;
she
scarcely
dare
to
raise
her
eye
towards
either
.
<EOS>
anxious
and
unhappy
for
them
both
<EOS>
,
the
thought
stole
on
her
through
the
crowd
,
that
it
may
have
be
well
for
them
if
this
noise
of
tongue
and
tread
of
foot
have
never
come
there
,
---
if
the
old
dulness
and
decay
have
never
be
replace
by
novelty
and
splendour
,
---
if
the
neglect
child
have
find
no
friend
in
Edith
,
but
have
live
her
solitary
life
,
unpitied
and
forget
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
have
some
such
thought
too
,
but
they
be
not
so
quietly
develop
in
her
mind
.
<EOS>
this
good
matron
have
be
outrage
in
the
first
instance
by
not
receive
an
invitation
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
that
blow
partially
recover
,
she
have
go
to
a
vast
expense
to
make
such
a
figure
before
Mrs
Dombey
at
home
,
as
should
dazzle
the
sense
of
that
lady
,
and
heap
mortification
,
mountain
high
,
on
the
head
of
Mrs
Skewton
.
  
<EOS>
"

Mrs

Mr

I

<EOS>
Mrs

rise
erect
with
these
word

and
take
the
arm
of
Mr
Chick
,
who
escort
her
from
the
room
,
after
half
an
hour
's
shady
sojourn
there
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
due
to
her
penetration
to
observe
that
she
certainly
be
not
miss
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
be
not
the
only
indignant
guest
;
for
Mr
Dombey
's
list
(
still
constantly
in
difficulty
)
be
,
as
a
body
,
indignant
with
Mrs
Dombey
's
list
for
look
at
them
through
eyeglass
,
and
audibly
wonder
who
all
those
people
be
;
while
Mrs
Dombey
's
list
complain
of
weariness
,
and
the
young
thing
with
the
shoulder
,
deprive
of
the
attention
of
that
gay
youth
Cousin
Feenix
(
who
go
away
from
the
dinnertable
)
,
confidentially
allege
to
thirty
or
forty
friend
that
she
be
bore
to
death
.
<EOS>
all
the
old
lady
with
the
burden
on
their
head
,
have
great
or
less
cause
of
complaint
against
Mrs
Dombey
;
and
the
director
and
chairman
coincide
in
think
that
if
Dombey
must
marry
,
he
have
better
have
marry
somebody
nearer
his
own
age
,
not
quite
so
handsome
,
and
a
little
better
off
.
<EOS>
the
general
opinion
among
this
class
of
gentleman
be
,
that
it
be
a
weak
thing
in
Dombey
,
and
he
would
live
to
repent
it
.
<EOS>
hardly
anybody
there
,
except
the
mild
man
,
stay
,
or
go
away
,
without
consider
himself
or
herself
neglect
and
aggrieve
by
Mr
Dombey
or
Mrs
Dombey
;
and
the
speechless
female
in
the
black
velvet
hat
be
find
to
have
be
stricken
mute
,
because
the
lady
in
the
crimson
velvet
have
be
hand
down
before
her
.
<EOS>
the
nature
even
of
the
mild
man
get
corrupt
,
either
from
their
curdling
it
with
too
much
lemonade
,
or
from
the
general
inoculation
that
prevail
;
and
they
make
sarcastic
joke
to
one
another
,
and
whisper
disparagement
on
stair
and
in
bye
-
place
.
<EOS>
the
general
dissatisfaction
and
discomfort
so
diffuse
itself
,
that
the
assemble
footman
in
the
hall
be
as
well
acquaint
with
it
as
the
company
above
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
the
very
linkman
outside
get
hold
of
it
,
and
compare
the
party
to
a
funeral
out
of
mourning
,
with
none
of
the
company
remember
in
the
will
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
the
guest
be
all
go
,
and
the
linkman
too
;
and
the
street
,
crowd
so
long
with
carriage
,
be
clear
;
and
the
die
light
show
no
one
in
the
room
,
but
Mr
Dombey
and
Mr
Carker
,
who
be
talk
together
apart
,
and
Mrs
Dombey
and
her
mother
:
the
former
seat
on
an
ottoman
;
the
latter
reclining
in
the
Cleopatra
attitude
,
await
the
arrival
of
her
maid
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
have
finish
his
communication
to
Carker
,
the
latter
advance
obsequiously
to
take
leave
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
trust

he

that
the
fatigue

She
look
at

with
a
supercilious

it

not

of

my
reverence

almost
from
childhood

when
I
say
that
if
he
have
a
fault

it
be
a
lofty
stubbornness

root
in
that
noble
pride

sense
of
power
which
belong
to
him

which
we
must
all
defer
to
;
which
be
not
assailable

the
obstinacy

grow
upon

day

somewhat
deep

occupy

endure
happiness

yours

<EOS>
there
I
resolve
to
await
the
time
of
your

to
do
as
I
have
now
do

at

no

almost
represent

I
can
acquit

almost
equally

by
confidence

on

in

for

reason
I
have

May
I
aspire

Withers

meet
him

amazed

perceive
remotely

provide

well
presentation

complexion

as
those
in

know

have
no
doubt
of
the
correctness
of
this
opinion

to
have
a
little
artificial
bloom
drop
into
the
hollow
cavern
of
her
cheek

<EOS>
It
be
a
tremendous
sight
to
see
this
old
woman
in
her
finery
leer
and
mince
at
death
,
and
play
off
her
youthful
trick
upon
him
as
if
he
have
be
the
Major
;
but
an
alteration
in
her
mind
that
ensue
on
the
paralytic
stroke
be
fraught
with
as
much
matter
for
reflection
,
and
be
quite
as
ghastly
.
  
<EOS>
whether
the
weakening
of
her
intellect
make
her
more
cunning

false
than
before
,
or
whether
it
confuse
her
between
what
she
have
assume
to
be
and
what
she
really
have
be
,
or
whether
it
have
awaken
any
glimmering
of
remorse
,
which
could
neither
struggle
into
light
nor
get
back
into
total
darkness
,
or
whether
,
in
the
jumble
of
her
faculty
,
a
combination
of
these
effect
have
be
shake
up
,
which
be
perhaps
the
more
likely
supposition
,
the
result
be
this
:
---
that
she
become
hugely
exact
in
respect
of
Edith
's
affection
and
gratitude
and
attention
to
her
;
highly
laudatory
of
herself
as
a
most
inestimable
parent
;
and
very
jealous
of
have
any
rival
in
Edith
's
regard
.
<EOS>
further
,
in
place
of
remember
that
compact
make
between
them
for
an
avoidance
of
the
subject
,
she
constantly
allude
to
her
daughter
's
marriage
as
a
proof
of
her
be
an
incomparable
mother
;
and
all
this
,
with
the
weakness

peevishness
of
such
a

always
serve
for

sarcastic
commentary

Captain
Cuttle
begin
to
look
at

of
an
evening
,
with
feeling
of
mystery
and
uneasiness
.
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
,
in
his
honour
,
would
as
soon
have
think
of
open
the
parcel
one
hour
before
the
expiration
of
the
term
,
as
he
would
have
think
of
open
himself
,
to
study
his
own
anatomy
.
<EOS>
He
merely
bring
it
out
,
at
a
certain
stage
of
his
first
evening
pipe
,
lay
it
on
the

,
and
sit
gaze
at
the
outside
of
it
,
through
the
smoke
,
in
silent
gravity
,
for
two
or
three
hour
at
a
spell
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
when
he
have
contemplate
it
thus
for
a
pretty
long
while
,
the
Captain
would
hitch
his
chair
,
by
degree
,
farther
and
farther
off
,
as
if
to
get
beyond
the
range
of
its

;
but
if
this
be
his

he
never
succeed

bring

in

rove
to
the

,
its

immediately
follow

<EOS>
but
since
his
last
interview
with
Mr
Carker
,
Captain
Cuttle
have
come
to
entertain
doubt
whether
his
former
intervention
in
behalf
of
that
young
lady
and
his
dear
boy
Wal'r
,
have
prove
altogether
so
favourable
as
he
could
have
wish
,
and
as
he
at
the
time
believe
.
<EOS>
the
Captain
be
trouble
with
a
serious
misgiving
that
he
have
do
more
harm
than
good
,
in
short
;
and
in
his
remorse
and
modesty
he
make
the
good
atonement
he
could
think
of
,
by
put
himself
out
of
the
way
do
any
harm
to
any
one
,
and
,
as
it
be
,
throw
himself
overboard
for
a
dangerous
person

in

the
Captain
pass
whole

without

a

with
any

although
he
be
accustomed
to
quote
the

,
without

,
after
his

he
appear
to
read
it
with
as
reverent
an

as
if
he
have
get
it
all
by

in

eligible
room

in

avail
himself
of
its
accommodation
in
that
regard
by
the
half
-
hour
together

without
at
all
advance
in
intimacy
with
the
Captain

<EOS>
the
Captain
,
render
cautious
by
his
late
experience
,
be
unable
quite
to
satisfy
his
mind
<EOS>
whether
Mr
Toots
be
the
mild
subject
he
appear
to
be
,
or
be
a
profoundly
artful
and
dissimulating
hypocrite
.
<EOS>
His
frequent
reference
to
Miss
Dombey
be
suspicious
;
but
the
Captain
have
a
secret
kindness
for
Mr
Toots
's
apparent
reliance
on
him
,
and
forbore
to
decide
against
him
for
the
present
;
merely
eye
him

with
a
sagacity
not

approach
the
subject

near

"
Captain

out
Mr

<EOS>

Mr

steadfast
to
his

<EOS>
the
Captain
seem
strike
by
the
originality
and
power
of
this
remark
,
and
look
at
Mr
Toots
as
if
he
think
there
be
a
great

more
in
him

not

because

and
you

<EOS>
His
employer
settle
the
last

the
tin
canister
and
tell
the
Grinder

money
out
in
full
upon

<EOS>
Rob
,
snivelling
and
sob
,
and
grievously
wound
in
his
feeling
,
take
up
the
piece
one
by
one
,
with
a
sob
and
a
snivel
for
each
,
and
tie
them
up
separately
in
knot
in
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
;
then
he
ascend
to
the
roof
of
the
house
and
fill
his
hat
and
pocket
with
pigeon
;
then
,
come
down
to
his
bed
under
the
counter
and
make
up
his
bundle
,
snivel
and
sob
louder
as
if
he
be
cut
to
the
heart
by
old
association
;
then
he
whine
,
"
good
night
,
Captain
.
<EOS>
I
leave
you
without
malice
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
go
out
upon
the
door
-
step
,
pull
the
little
Midshipman
's
nose
as
a
parting
indignity
,
and
go
away
down
the
street
grin
triumph
.
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
,
leave
to
himself
,
resume
his
perusal
of
the
news
as
if
nothing
unusual
or
unexpected
have
take
place
,
and
go
read
on
with
the
great
assiduity
.
<EOS>
but
never
a
word
do
Captain
Cuttle
understand
,
though
he
read
a
vast
number
,
for
Rob
the
Grinder
be
scamper
up
one
column
and
down
another
all
through
the
newspaper
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
doubtful
whether
the
worthy
Captain
have
ever
feel
himself
quite
abandon
until
now
;
but
now
,
old
Sol
Gills
,
Walter
,
and
Heart
's
Delight
be
lose
to
him
indeed
,
and
now
Mr
Carker
deceive
and
jeer
him
cruelly
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
represent
in
the
false
Rob
,
to
whom
he
have
hold
forth
many
a
time
on
the
recollection
that
be
warm
within
him
;
he
have
believe
in
the
false
Rob
,
and
have
be
glad
to
believe
in
him
;
he
have
make
a
companion
of
him
as
the
last
of
the
old
ship
's
company
;
he
have
take
the
command
of
the
little
Midshipman
with
him
at
his
right
hand
;
he
have
mean
to
do
his
duty
by
him
,
and
have
feel
almost
as
kindly
towards
the
boy
as
if
they
have
be
shipwreck
and
cast
upon
a
desert
place
together
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
that
the
false
Rob
have
bring
distrust
,
treachery
,
and
meanness
into
the
very
parlour
,
which
be
a
kind
of
sacred
place
,
Captain
Cuttle
feel
as
if
the
parlour
may
have
go
down
next
,
and
not
surprise
him
much
by
its
sinking
,
or
give
him
any
very
great
concern
.
  
<EOS>
therefore
Captain
Cuttle
read
the
newspaper
with
profound
attention
and
no
comprehension
,
and
therefore
Captain
Cuttle
say
nothing
whatever
about
Rob
to
himself
,
or
admit
to
himself
that
he
be
think
about
him
,
or
would
recognise
in
the
most
distant
manner
that
Rob
have
anything
to
do
with
his
feeling
as
lonely
as
Robinson
Crusoe
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
same
composed
,
business
-
like
way
,
the
Captain
step
over
to
Leadenhall
Market
in
the
dusk
,
and
effect
an
arrangement
with
a
private
watchman
on
duty
there
,
to
come
and
put
up
and
take
down
the
shutter
of
the
Wooden
Midshipman
every
night
and
morning
.
<EOS>
He
then
call
in
at
the
eat
-
house
to
diminish
by
one
half
the
daily
ration
theretofore
supply
to
the
Midshipman
,
and
at
the
publichouse
to
stop
the
traitor
's
beer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
young
man
,
"
say
the
Captain
,
in
explanation
to
the
young
lady
at
the
bar
,
"
my
young
man
have
better
himself
,
<EOS>
Mississippi
"
<EOS>
lastly
,
the
Captain
resolve
to
take
possession
of
the
bed
under
the
counter
,
and
to
turn
in
there
o
'
night
instead
of
up
stair
,
as
sole
guardian
of
the
property
.
  
<EOS>
from
this
,
bed
Captain
Cuttle
daily
rise
thenceforth
,
and
clap
on
his
glaze
hat
at
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
with
the
solitary
air
of
Crusoe
finish
his
toilet
with
his
goat
-
skin
cap
;
and
although
his
fear
of
a
visitation
from
the
savage
tribe
,
MacStinger
,
be
somewhat
cool
,
as
similar
apprehension
on
the
part
of
that
lone
mariner
use
to
be
by
the
lapse
of
a
long
interval
without
any
symptom
of
the
cannibal
,
he
still
observe
a
regular
routine
of
defensive
operation
,
and
never
encounter
a
bonnet
without
previous
survey
from
his
castle
of
retreat
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
(
during
which
he
receive
no
call
from
Mr
Toots
,
who
write
to
say
he
be
out
of
town
)
<EOS>
his
own
voice
begin
to
have
a
strange
sound
in
his
ear
;
and
he
acquire
such
habit
of
profound
meditation
from
much
polishing
and
stow
away
of
the
stock
,
and
from
much
sit
behind
the
counter
reading
,
or
look
out
of
window
,
that
the
red
rim
make
on
his
forehead
by
the
hard
glaze
hat
,
sometimes
ache
again
with
excess
of
reflection
.
  
<EOS>
the
year
be
now
expire
,
Captain
Cuttle
deem
it
expedient
to
open
the
packet
;
but
as
he
have
always
design
do
this
in
the
presence
of
Rob
the
Grinder
,
who
have
bring
it
to
him
,
and
as
he
have
an
idea
that
it
would
be
regular
and
<EOS>
ship
-
shape
to
open
it
in
the
presence
of
somebody
,
he
be
sadly
put
to
it
for
want
of
a
witness
.
<EOS>
in
this
difficulty
,
he
hail
one
day
with
unusual
delight
the
announcement
in
the
Shipping
Intelligence
of
the
arrival
of
the
Cautious
Clara
,
Captain
John
Bunsby
,
from
a
coasting
voyage
;
and
to
that
philosopher
immediately
dispatch
a
letter
by
post
,
enjoin
inviolable
secrecy
as
to
his
place
of
residence
,
and
request
to
be
favour
with
an
early
visit
,
in
the
evening
season
.
  
<EOS>
Bunsby
,
who
be
one
of
those
sage
who
act
upon
conviction
,
take
some
day
to
get
the
conviction
thoroughly
into
his
mind
,
that
he
have
receive
a
letter
to
this
effect
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
have
grapple
with
the
fact
,
and
master
it
,
he
promptly
send
his
boy
with
the
message
,
"
He
be
a
come
to

night
.
<EOS>
"
who
be
instruct
to
deliver
those
word
and
disappear
,
fulfil
his
mission
like
a
tarry
spirit
,
charge
with
a
mysterious
warning
.
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
,
well
pleased
to
receive
it
,
make
preparation
of
pipe
and
rum
and
water
,
and
await
his
visitor
in
the
back
parlour
.
<EOS>
at
the
hour
of
eight
,
a
deep
lowing
,
as
of
a
nautical
Bull
,
outside
the
shop

,
succeed
by
the
knocking
of
a
stick
on
the
panel
,
announce
to
the
listening
ear
of
Captain
Cuttle
,
that
Bunsby
be
alongside
:
whom
he
instantly
admit

shaggy
and
loose

and
with
his
stolid
mahogany
visage

as
usual
,
appear
to

no

anything
before

the

unaccompanied

,
"

"

the

render
irrepressible
homage

"
with
these
oracular
word
---
they
seem
almost
to
make
the
Captain
giddy
;
they
launch
him
upon
such
a
sea
of
speculation
and
conjecture
---
the
sage
submit
to
be
help
off
with
his
pilotcoat
,
and
accompany
his
friend
into
the
back
parlour
,
where
his
hand
presently
alight
on
the
rum
-
bottle
,
from
which
he
brew
a
stiff
glass
of
grog
;
and
presently
afterwards
on
a
pipe
,
which
he
fill
,
light
,
and
begin
to
smoke
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
imitate
his
visitor
in
the
matter
of
these
particular
,
though
the
rapt
and
imperturbable
manner
of
the
great
Commander
be
far
above
his
power
,
sit
in
the
opposite
corner
of
the
fireside
,
observe
him
respectfully
,
and
as
if
he
wait
for
some
encouragement
or
expression
of
curiosity
on
Bunsby
's
part
which
should
lead
him
to
his
own
affair
.
<EOS>
but
as
the
mahogany
philosopher
give
no
evidence
of
be
sentient
of
anything
but
warmth
and
tobacco
,
except
once
,
when
take
his
pipe
from
his
lip
to
make
room
for
his
glass
,
he
incidentally
remark
with
exceed
gruffness
,
that
his
name
be
Jack
Bunsby
---
a
declaration
that
present
but
small
opening
for
conversation
---
the
Captain
bespeak
his
attention
in
a
short
complimentary
exordium
,
narrate
the
whole
history
of
Uncle

departure

with
the
change

conclude
by

in
forlorn
search

I
know
that

you

restlessness

so
no

Lord
forbid

<EOS>
except
to
keep
it
for
a
more
rightful

;
and
I
hope
yet
as
the
rightful
owner
,
Sol
Gills
,
be
live
and
will
come
back
,
strange
as
it
be
that
he
be
not
forward
no
dispatch
.
<EOS>
now
,
what
be
your
opinion
,
Bunsby
,
as
to
stowing
of
these
here
paper
away
again
,
and
mark
outside
as
they
be
open
,
such
a
day
,
in
the
presence
of
John
Bunsby
and
Ed'ard
Cuttle
?
"
  
<EOS>
Bunsby
,
descry
no
objection
,
on
the
coast
of
Greenland
or
elsewhere
,
to
this
proposal
,
it
be
carry
into
execution
;
and
that
great
man
,
bring
his
eye
into
the
present
for
a
moment
,
affixed
his
sign
-
manual
to
the
cover
,
totally
abstaining
,
with
characteristic
modesty
,
from
the
use
of
capital
letter
.
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
,
have
attach
his
own
left
-
handed
signature
,
and
lock
up
the
packet
in
the
iron
safe
,
entreat
his
guest
to
mix
another
glass
and
smoke
another
pipe
;
and
do
the
like
himself
,
fall
a
musing
over
the
fire
on
the
possible
fortune
of
the
poor
old
instrument
-
maker
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
a
surprise
occur
,
so
overwhelming
and
terrific
that
Captain
Cuttle
,
unsupporte
by
the
presence
of
Bunsby
,
must
have
sink
beneath
it
,
and
be
a
lost
man
from
that
fatal
hour
.
  
<EOS>
how
the
Captain
,
even
in
the
satisfaction
of
admit
such
a
guest
,
could
have
only
shut
the
door
,
and
not
lock
it
,
of
which
negligence
he
be
undoubtedly
guilty
,
be
one
of
those
question
that
must
for
ever
remain
mere
point
of
speculation
,
or
vague
charge
against
destiny
.
<EOS>
but
by
that
unlocked
door
,
at
this
quiet
moment
,
do
the
fell
MacStinger
dash
into
the
parlour
,
bring
Alexander
MacStinger
in
her
parental
arm
,
and
confusion
and
vengeance
(
not
to
mention
Juliana
MacStinger
,
and
the
sweet
child
's
brother
,
Charles
MacStinger
,
popularly
know
about
the
scene
of
his
youthful
sport
,
as
Chowley
)
in
her
train
.
<EOS>
She
come
so
swiftly
and
so
silently
,
like
a
rush
air
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
East
India
Docks
,
that
Captain
Cuttle
find
himself
in
the
very
act
of
sit
look
at
her
,
before
the
calm
face
with
which
he
have
be
meditate
,
change
to
one
of
horror
and
dismay
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
moment
Captain
Cuttle
understand
the
full
extent
of
his
misfortune
,
self
-
preservation
dictate
an
attempt
at
flight
.
<EOS>
dart
at
little
door
which
open
from
the
parlour
on
the
steep
little
range
of
cellar
-
step
,
the
Captain
make
a
rush
,
head
-
foremost
,
at
the
latter
,
like
a
man
indifferent
to
bruise
and
contusion
,
who
only
seek
to
hide
himself
in
the
bowel
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
in
this
gallant
effort
he
would
probably
have
succeed
,
but
for
the
affectionate
disposition
of
Juliana
and
Chowley
,
who
pin
him
by
the
leg
---
one
of
those
dear
child
hold
on
to
each
---
claim
him
as
their
friend
,
with
lamentable
cry
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
Mrs
MacStinger
,
who
never
enter
upon
any
action
of
importance
without
previously
invert
Alexander
MacStinger
,
to
bring
him
within
the
range
of
a
brisk
battery
of
slap
,
and
then
sit
him
down
to
cool
as
the
reader
first
beheld
him
,
perform
that
solemn
rite
,
as
if
on
this
occasion
it
be
a
sacrifice
to
the
Furies
;
and
have
deposit
the
victim
on
the
floor
,
make
at
the
Captain
with
a
strength
of
purpose
that
appear
to
threaten
scratch
to
the
interpose
Bunsby

<EOS>
the
cry
of
the
two
eld
MacStingers
,
and
the
wailing
of
young
Alexander

who
may
be
say
to
have
pass
a
piebald
childhood
,
forasmuch
as
he
be
black
in
the
face
during
one
half
of
that
fairy
period
of
existence
,
combine
to
make
this
visitation
the
more
awful
.

but
when
silence
reign
again

and
the
Captain
,
in
a
violent
perspiration
,
stand
meekly
look
at
Mrs

at

Captain
Cuttle
could
hardly
believe
it
,
even
of
this
great
man
,
though
he
see
it
do
with
his
wake
eye
;
but
Bunsby
,
advance
boldly
,
put
his
shaggy
blue
arm
round
Mrs

,
and
so
soften
her
by
his
magic
way
of
do

by
these

he

no

that

Speechless

utterly
amazed

the
Captain

gradually
persuade
this
inexorable
woman
into
the
shop

return
for
rum
and
water
and
a
candle
,
take
them
to
her

and
pacify
her
without

<EOS>
presently
he
look
in
with
his
pilot

coat
on

He

before

shut

<EOS>
still

as
time

and
Bunsby
fail
to
reappear
,
the
Captain
begin
to
entertain
uncomfortable
doubt
of
another

<EOS>
whether
Bunsby
have
be
artfully
decoy
to
Brig
Place

be
there
detain
in

hostage

the

as
a
man
of
honour

to
release
him
,
by
the
sacrifice
of
his

liberty

<EOS>
whether
he
have
be
attack
and
defeat
by
Mrs

and
be
ashamed
to
show
himself
after
his
discomfiture
.
<EOS>
whether
Mrs
MacStinger
,
think
well
of
it
,
in
the
uncertainty
of
her
temper
,
have
turn
back
to
board
the
Midshipman
again
,
and
Bunsby
,
pretend
to
conduct
her
by
a
short
cut
,
be
endeavour
to
lose
the
family
amid
the
wild
and
savage
place
of
the
City
.
<EOS>
above
all
,
what
it
would
behove
him
,
Captain
Cuttle
,
to
do
,
in
case
of
his
hearing
no
more
,
either
of
the
macstinger
or
of
Bunsby
,
which
,
in
these
wonderful
and
unforeseen
conjunction
of
event
,
may
possibly
happen
.
  
<EOS>
He
debate
all
this
until
he
be
tired
;
and
still
no
Bunsby
.
<EOS>
He
make
up
his
bed
under
the
counter
,
all
ready
for
turn
in
;
and
still
no
Bunsby
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
when
the
Captain
have
give
him
up
,
for
that
night
at
least
,
and
have
begin
to
undress
,
the
sound
of
approach
wheel
be
hear
,
and
,
stop
at
the
door
,
be
succeed
by
Bunsby
's
hail

<EOS>
the
Captain
tremble
to
think
that
Mrs
MacStinger
be
not
to
be
get
rid
of
,
and
have
be
bring
back
in
a
coach
.
  
<EOS>
but
no
.
<EOS>
Bunsby
be
accompany
by
nothing
but
a
large
box
,
which
he
haul
into
the
shop
with
his
own
hand
,
and
as
soon
as
he
have
haul
in
,
sit
upon
.
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
know
it
for
the
chest
he
have
leave
at
Mrs
MacStinger
's
house
,
and
looking
,
candle
in
hand
,
at
Bunsby
more
attentively
,
believe
that
he
be
three
sheet
in
the
wind
,
or
,
it
plain
word
,
drunk
.
<EOS>
It
be
difficult
,
however
,
to
be
sure
of
this
;
the
Commander
have
no
trace
of
expression
in
his
face
when
sober
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cuttle
,
"
say
the
Commander
,
get
off
the

open
the
lid
,
"
be

<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
look
in

identify
his

<EOS>
"
Done
pretty
taut

trim

say
Bunsby
.
  
<EOS>
the
grateful
and
bewilder
Captain
grasp
him
by
the
hand
,
and
be
launch
into
a
reply
expressive
of
his
astonished
feeling
,
when
Bunsby
disengage
himself
by
a
jerk
of
his
wrist
,
and
seem
to
make
an
effort
to
wink
with
his
revolving
eye
,
the
only
effect
of
which
attempt
,
in
his
condition
,
be
nearly
to
overbalance
him
.
<EOS>
He
then
abruptly

as
it
be
not
his
humour
to
be
often

,
Captain
Cuttle
decide
not
to
go
or
send
to
him
next
day
,
or
until
he
should

<EOS>
the
Captain
,
therefore
,
renew
his
solitary
life
next
morning
,
and
think
profoundly

many
morning

of

Bunsby
's
sentiment
concern
him

and
the

<EOS>
much
of
such
thinking
strengthen
Captain
Cuttle
's
hope
;
and
he
humour
them
and
himself
by
watch
for
the
instrument

maker
at

as
he
venture
to
do
now
,
in

strange
liberty

and
set
his

in
its
place
,
and
arrange
the
little
parlour
as
it
use
to
be
,
in
case
he
should
come
home
unexpectedly
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
,
in
his
thoughtfulness
,
take
down
a
certain
little
miniature
of
Walter
as
a
schoolboy
,
from
its
accustomed
nail
,
lest
it
should
shock
the
old
man
on
his
return

<EOS>
the
Captain
have
his
presentiment
,
too
,
sometimes
,
that
he
would
come
on
such
a
day
;
and
one
particular
Sunday
,
even
order
a
double
allowance
of
dinner
,
he
be
so
sanguine
.
<EOS>
but
come
,
old

and
still
the
neighbour
notice
how
the

door
of

evening

Domestic
Relations
 
<EOS>
it
be
not
in
the
nature
of
thing
that
a
man
of
Mr
Dombey
's
mood
,
oppose
to
such
a
spirit
as
he
have
raise
against
himself
,
should
be
soften
in
the
imperious
asperity
of
his
temper
;
or
that
the
cold
hard
armour
of
pride
in
which
he
live
encased
,
should
be
make
more
flexible
by
constant
collision
with
haughty
scorn
and
defiance
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
curse
of
such
a
nature
---
it
be
a
main
part
of
the
heavy
retribution
on
itself
it
bear
within
itself
---
<EOS>
that
while
deference
and
concession
swell
its
evil
quality
,
and
be
the
food
it
grow
upon
,
resistance
and
a
questioning
of
its
exact
claim
,
foster
it
too
,
no

<EOS>
the
evil
that
be
in
it
find
equally
its
mean
of
growth
and
propagation
in
opposite
.
<EOS>
It
draw
support
and
life
from
sweet
and
bitter
;
bow
down
before

or
unacknowledge
,
it
still
enslave
the
breast
in
which
it
have
its
throne
;
and
,
worship
or
reject
,
be
as
hard
a
master
as
the
Devil
in
dark
fable
.
  
<EOS>
towards
his
first
wife
,
Mr
Dombey
,
in
his
cold
and
lofty
arrogance
,
have
bear
himself
like
the
remove
Being
he
almost
conceive
himself
to
be
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
"
Mr
Dombey
"
with
her
when
she
first
see
him
,
and
he
be
"
Mr
Dombey
"
when
she
die
.
<EOS>
He
have
assert
his
greatness
during
their
whole
married
life
,
and
she
have
meekly
recognise
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
keep
his
distant
seat
of
state
on
the
top
of
his
throne
,
and
she
her
humble
station
on
its
low
step
;
and
much
good
it
have
do
him
,
so
to
live
in
solitary
bondage
to
his
one
idea
!
<EOS>
He
have
imagine
that
the
proud
character
of
his
second
wife
would
have
be
add
to
his
own
---
would
have
merge
into
it
,
and
exalt
his
greatness
.
<EOS>
He
have
picture
himself
haughty
than
ever
,
with
Edith
's
haughtiness
subservient
to
his
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
entertain
the
possibility
of
its
array
itself
against
him
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
when
he
find
it
rise
in
his
path
at
every
step
and
turn
of
his
daily
life
,
fix
its
cold
,
defiant
,
and
contemptuous
face
upon
him
,
this
pride
of
his
,
instead
of
wither
,
or
hang
down
its
head
beneath
the
shock
,
put
forth
new
shoot
,
become
more
concentrated
and
intense
,
more
gloomy
,
sullen
,
irksome
,
and
unyielding
,
than
it
have
ever
be
before
.
  
<EOS>
who
wear
such
armour
,
too
,
bear
with
him
ever
another
heavy
retribution
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
proof
against
conciliation
,
love
,
and
confidence
!
<EOS>
against
all
gentle
sympathy
from
without
,
all
trust
,
all
tenderness
,
all
soft
emotion
;
but
to
deep
stab
in
the
selflove
,
it
be
as
vulnerable
as
the
bare
breast
to
steel
;
and
such
torment
fester
rankle
there
,
as
follow
on
no
other
wound
,
no
,
though
deal
with
the
mailed
hand
of
Pride
itself
,
on
weak
pride
,
disarm
and
throw
down
.
  
<EOS>
such
wound
be
his
.
<EOS>
He
feel
them
sharply
,
in
the
solitude
of
his
old
room
;
whither
he
now
begin
often
to
retire
again
,
and
pass
long
solitary
hour
.
<EOS>
It
seem
his
fate
to
be
ever
proud
and
powerful
;
ever
humble
and
powerless
where
he
would
be
most
strong
.
<EOS>
who
seem
fated
to
work
out
that
doom
?
  
<EOS>
who
?
<EOS>
who
be
it
who
could
win
his
wife
as
she
have
win
his
boy
?
<EOS>
who
be
it
who
have
show
him
that
new
victory
,
as
he
sit
in
the
dark
corner
?
<EOS>
who
be
it
<EOS>
whose
least
word
do
what
his
utmost
mean
could
not
?
<EOS>
who
be
it
who
,
unaide
by
his
love
,
regard
or
notice
,
thrive
and
grow
beautiful
when
those
so
aid
die
?
<EOS>
who
could
it
be
,
but
the
same
child
at
whom
he
have
often
glance
uneasily
in
her
motherless
infancy
,
with
a
kind
of
dread
,
lest
he
may
come
to
hate
her
;
and
of
whom
his
foreboding
be
fulfil
,
for
he
do
hate
her
in
his
heart
?
  
<EOS>
yes
,
and
he
would
have
it
hatre
,
and
he
make
it
hatred
,
though
some
sparkle
of
the
light
in
which
she
have
appear
before
him
on
the
memorable
night
of
his
return
home
with
his
Bride
,
occasionally
hang
about
her
still
.
<EOS>
He
know
now
that
she
be
beautiful
;
he
do
not
dispute
that
she
be
graceful
and
win
,
and
that
in
the
bright
dawn
of
her
womanhood
she
have
come
upon
him
,
a
surprise
.
<EOS>
but
he
turn
even
this
against
her
.
<EOS>
in
his
sullen
and
unwholesome
brooding
,
the
unhappy
man
,
with
a
dull
perception
of
his
alienation
from
all
heart
,
and
a
vague
yearning
for
what
he
have
all
his
life
repel
,
make
a
distorted
picture
of
his
right
and
wrong
,
and
justify
himself
with
it
against
her
.
<EOS>
the
worthy
she
promise
to
be
of
him
<EOS>
,
the
great
claim
he
be
dispose
to
ante
-
date
upon
her
duty
and
submission
?
<EOS>
when
have
she
ever
show
him
duty
and
submission
?
<EOS>
do
she
grace
his
life
---
or
Edith
's
?
<EOS>
have
her
attraction
be
manifest
first
to
him
---
or
Edith
?
<EOS>
why
,
he
and
she
have
never
be
,
from
her
birth
,
like
father
and
child
!
<EOS>
They
have
always
be
estrange
.
<EOS>
She
have
cross
him
every
way
and
everywhere
.
<EOS>
She
be
league
against
him
now
.
<EOS>
Her
very
beauty
soften
nature
that
be
obdurate
to
him
,
and
insult
him
with
an
unnatural
triumph
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
that
in
all
this
there
be
muttering
of
an
awakened
feeling
in
his
breast
,
however
selfishly
arouse
by
his
position
of
disadvantage
,
in
comparison
with
what
she
may
have
make
his
life
.
<EOS>
but
he
silence
the
distant
thunder
with
the
rolling
of
his
sea
of
pride
.
<EOS>
He
would
bear
nothing
but
his
pride
.
<EOS>
and
in
his
pride
,
a
heap
of
inconsistency
,
and
misery
,
and
self

inflict
torment

he
hate
her

<EOS>
to
the
moody
,
stubborn
,
sullen
demon
,
that
possess
him
,
his
wife
oppose
her
different
pride
in
its
full
force
.
<EOS>
They
never
could
have
lead
a
happy
life
together
;
but
nothing
could
have
make
it
more
unhappy
,
than
the
wilful
and
determined
warfare
of
such
element
.
<EOS>
His
pride
be
set
upon
maintain
his
magnificent
supremacy
,
and
force
recognition
of
it
from
her
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
be
rack
to
death
,
and
turn
but
<EOS>
her
haughty
glance
of
calm
inflexible
disdain
upon
him
,
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
such
recognition
from
Edith
!
<EOS>
He
little
know
through
what
a
storm
and
struggle
she
have
be
drive
onward
to
the
crowning
honour
of
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
little
know
how
much
she
think
she
have
concede
,
when
she
suffer
him
to
call
her
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dombey
be
resolve
to
show
her
that
he
be
supreme
.
<EOS>
there
must
be
no
will
but
his
.
<EOS>
proud
<EOS>
he
desire
that
she
should
be
,
but
she
must
be
proud
for
,
not
against
him
.
<EOS>
as
he
sit
alone
,
harden
,
he
would
often
hear
her
go
out
and
come
home
,
tread
the
round
of
London
life
with
no
more
heed
of
his
liking
or
disliking
,
pleasure
or
displeasure
,
than
if
he
have
be
her
groom
.
<EOS>
Her
cold
supreme
indifference
---
his
own
unquestioned
attribute
usurped
---
sting
him
more
than
any
other
kind
of
treatment
could
have
do
;
and
he
determine
to
bend
her
to
his
magnificent
and
stately
will
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
be
long
communing
with
these
thought
,
when
one
night
he
seek
her
in
her
own
apartment
,
after
he
have
hear
her
return
home
late
.
<EOS>
She
be
alone
,
in
her
brilliant
dress
,
and
have
but
that
moment
come
from
her
mother
's
room
.
<EOS>
Her
face
be
melancholy
and
pensive
,
when
he
come
upon
her
;
but
it
mark
him
at
the
door
;
for
,
glance
at
the
mirror
before
it
,
he
see
immediately
,
as
in
a
picture
-
frame
,
the
knit
brow
,
and
darken
beauty
that
he
know
so
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs

"
he
say
,
enter
,
"
I
must
beg
leave
to
have
a

she
reply

<EOS>
"
there

he
return

<EOS>
"
You
mistake
your

<EOS>
I
be
use

choose
my

not

<EOS>
I
think
you
scarcely
understand
who

what
I
be

Mrs

<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
she
answer
,
"
that
I
understand
you
very
well

"
  
<EOS>
She
look
upon
him
as
she
say
so
,
and
fold
her
white
arm
,
sparkle
with
gold
and
gem
,
upon
her
swell
breast
,
turn
away
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
if
she
have
be
less
handsome
,
and
less
stately
in
her
cold
composure
,
she
may
not
have
have
the
power
of
impress
him
with
the
sense
of
disadvantage
that
penetrate
through
his
utmost
pride
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
the
power
,
and
he
feel
it
keenly
.
<EOS>
He
glance
round
the
room
:
see
how
the
splendid
mean
of
personal
adornment
,
and
the
luxury
of
dress
,
be
scatter
here
and
there
,
and
disregard
;
<EOS>
not
in
mere
caprice
and
carelessness
(
or
so
he
think
)
,
<EOS>
but
in
a
steadfast
haughty
disregard
of
costly
thing
:
and
feel
it
more
and
more
.
<EOS>
chaplet
of
flower
,
plume
of
feather
,
jewel
,
lace
,
silk
and
satin
;
look
where
he
would
,
he
see
rich
,
despise
,
pour
out
,
and
make
of
no
account
.
<EOS>
the
very
diamond
---
a
marriage
gift
---
that
rise
and
fall
impatiently
upon
her
bosom
,
seem
to
pant
to
break
the
chain
that
clasp
them
round
her
neck
,
and
roll
down
on
the
floor
where
she
may
tread
upon
them
.
  
<EOS>
He
feel
his
disadvantage
,
and
he
show
it
.
<EOS>
solemn
and
strange
among
his
wealth
of
colour
and
voluptuous
glitter
,
strange
and
constrain
towards
its
haughty
mistress
,
whose
repellent
beauty
it
repeat

present
all
around
him

as
in

many
fragment
of

,
he
be
conscious
of
embarrassment
and
awkwardness
.
<EOS>
nothing
that
minister
to
her
disdainful
self

possession
could
fail
to
gall
him
.
<EOS>
gall
and
irritated
with
himself
,
he
sit
down
,
and
go
on
in
no
improved
humour
:
  
"

She
merely

She
bend

He

all

round

not
wind
it

have

get
the
well
of

to
accustom
yourself
to
it
very
probably
on
many
similar
occasion

you
adopt
the
remedy
which
be
in
your
own

of
give
me
no
cause

complaint

after

great
store

this
means
of
reduce
his
proud
wife

who
be
perhaps
sufficiently
willing

exhibit
his
power

that
gentleman

new

Mr

I
may
not
find
it
necessary
ever
to
intrust
Mr

with
any
message

trivial

He
see
no

than
if

have
be
an

betook
himself
to
his
old
chamber
of
cogitation
,
carry
away
with
him
a
vivid
picture
in
his
mind
of
all
these
thing
,
and
a
rambling
and
unaccountable
speculation
(
such
as
sometimes
come
into
a
man

head
)
<EOS>
how
they
would
all
look

He

there
be
no

for
,
indeed
,
she
seem
upon
the

,
earthy

<EOS>
without
have
undergo
any
decide
second
attack
of
her
malady
,
the
old
woman
seem
to
have
crawl
backward
in

recovery
from

<EOS>
She
be
more
lean
and
shrink
,
more
uncertain
in

imbecility
,

make
strange
confusion
in

memory
.
<EOS>
among
other
symptom
of

affliction

she
fall
into
the
habit

It

<EOS>
in

it

no

proach
me

shake
off
this

"
and
in
a
grisly
resumption
of
her
coquettish
way
,
she
make
a
dab
at
the
Major
with
her
fan
,
but
overset
Mr

's
breakfast
cup
instead
,
which
be
in
quite
a
different
direction
.
  
<EOS>
then
she
call
for
Withers
,
and
charge
him
to
see
particularly
that
word
be
leave
about
some
trivial
alteration
in
her
room
,
which
must
be
all
make
before
she
come
back
,
and
which
must
be
set
about
immediately
,
as
there
be
no
say
how
soon
she
may
come
back
;
for
she
have
a
great
many
engagement
,

all

of
people
to
call
upon

<EOS>
wither
receive
these
direction
with
become
deference
,
and
give
his
guarantee
for
their
execution
;
but
when
he
withdraw
a
pace
or
two
behind
her
,
it
appear
as
if
he
could
not
help
look
strangely
at
the
Major
,
who
could
not
help
look
strangely
at
Mr
Dombey
,
who
could
not

look
strangely
at
Cleopatra

who
could

nod
her
bonnet
over
one
eye
,
and
rattle
her
knife
and
fork
upon
her
plate
in
use
them

as

she
be
play
castanet

<EOS>
Edith
alone
never
lift
her
eye
to
any
face
at
the
table

and
never
seem
dismay
by
anything
her
mother
say
or
do
.
<EOS>
She
listen
to
her
disjointed
talk
,
or
at
least
,
turn
her
head
towards
her
when
address
;
reply
in
a
few
low
word
when
necessary
;
and
sometimes
stop
her
when
she
be
ramble
,
or
bring
her
thought
back
with
a
monosyllable
,
to
the
point
from
which
they
have
stray
.
<EOS>
the
mother
,
however
unsteady
in
other
thing
,
be
constant
in
this
---
that
she
be
always
observant
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
would
look
at
the
beautiful
face
,
in
its
marble
stillness
and
severity
,
now
with
a
kind
of
fearful
admiration
;
now
in
a
giggle
foolish
effort
to
move
it
to
a
smile
;
now
with
capricious
tear
and
jealous
shaking
of
her
head
,
as
imagine
herself
neglect
by
it
;
always
with
an
attraction
towards
it
,
that
never
fluctuate
like
her
other
idea
,
but
have
constant
possession
of
her
.
<EOS>
from
Edith
she
would
sometimes
look
at
Florence
,
and
back
again
at
Edith
,
in
a
manner
that
be
wild
enough
;
and
sometimes
she
would
try
to
look
elsewhere
,
as
if
to
escape
from
her
daughter
's
face
;
but
back
to
it
she
seem
force
to
come
,
although
it
never
seek
hers
unless
seek
,
or
trouble
her
with
one
single

<EOS>
Mr

add
,
that
he
do
not
know
what
right
Blimber
have
to
notice
his
being
in
Miss

company
,
and
that
if
he
think
he
mean
impudence
by
it
,
he
would
have
him
out
,
Doctor
or
no
doctor
;
but
he
suppose
it
be
only
his
ignorance
.
<EOS>
Mr

say
he
have
no

of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mr

,
however
,
as
an
intimate
friend

be
not

from
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Mr

<EOS>
after

he
give
Miss

health
,
observe
,
"
Feeder
,
you
have
no
idea
of
the
sentiment
with
which
I
propose

"
<EOS>
Mr

"

"
<EOS>
Mr

be
then
agitate
by
friendship

and
say
,
if
ever
toot
want
a
brother
,
he
know
where
to
find
him
,
either
by
post
or
parcel
.
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
likewise
say
,
that
if
he
may
advise
,
he
would
recommend
Mr
Toots
to
learn
the
guitar

or
,
at

the
flute
;
for
woman
like
music
,
when
you

pay
your
address

and
he
have
find
the
advantage

<EOS>
this
bring
Mr

to
the
confession

eye
upon
Cornelia
Blimber

<EOS>
He
inform
Mr

that
he
do
not
object
to
spectacle

and
that
if
the
Doctor
be
to
do
the
handsome
thing
and
give
up
the
business
,
why
,
there
they
be

<EOS>
He
say
it
be
his
opinion
that
when
a
man
have
make
a
handsome
sum
by
his
business
,
he
be
bind
to
give
it
up
;
and
that
Cornelia
would
be
an
assistance
in
it
which
any
man
may
be
proud
of
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
reply
by
launch
wildly
out
into
Miss
Dombey
's
praise
,
and
by
insinuation
that
sometimes
he
think
he
should
like
to
blow
his
brain
out
.
<EOS>
Mr
Feeder
strongly
urge
that
it
would
be
a
rash
attempt
,
and
show
him
,
as
a
reconcilement
to
existence
,
Cornelia
's
portrait

spectacle

as

business
;
and
he
feel
a
soft
romantic
pleasure
in
look
at
the
outside
of
the
house

and
think
that
the
Doctor
will
first
paint

put

into
thorough
repair

Mr

at

that
these
be
the
occasion

of
whom
the

continually
tell
the
club
that
she
never
do
wrap
up
enough

while
the
young
lady
with
the
back
,
who
have
so
much
trouble
with
her
eyelid
,
say
,
with
a
little
scream
,
that
she
must
have
be
enormously
old
,
and
that
she
die
of
all
kind
of
horror
,
and
you
must
not
mention
it

<EOS>
so
Edith

mother
lie
unmentioned
of
her
dear

who
be
deaf
to
the
wave
that
be
hoarse
with
repetition
of
their
mystery

and
blind
to
the
dust
that
be

upon

to

but
all
go
on

upon

edith
stand
there
alone

a
constantly
dilating
impression
of
his
patron
's
irresistible
command
over
him
,

power
of
do
anything
with
him
,
he
would
stand
watch

try

anticipate
his

in

<EOS>
Rob
have
not

in

it
would
have
be

act

no
common
temerity
to
inquire
---
whether
he
yield
so
completely
to
this
influence
in

part

because
he
have
float
suspicion
of

of

treacherous

he
have
himself
be

certainly
Rob

Mr

with
some
irrepressible
expression
of
the
new
power
he
hold

and
it
be
his
triumph
to
see
the

the

He

before

answer
from

<EOS>
---
he
show
her
that
he
would
have

or
that
he
would
speak
and
cut
Florence

and
she
give
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
as
he
have

the
watch
of
the
night
 
FLORENCE
,
long
since
awaken
from
her
dream
,
mournfully
observe
the
estrangement
between
her
father
and
Edith
,
and
see
it
widen
more
and
more
,
and
know
that
there
be
great
bitterness
between
them
every
day
.
<EOS>
each
day
's
add
knowledge
deepen
the
shade
upon
her
love
and
hope
,
rouse
up
the
old
sorrow
that
have
slumber
for
a
little
time
,
and
make
it
even
heavy
to
bear
than
it
have
be
before
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
hard
---
how
hard
may
none
but
Florence
ever
know
!
---
to
have
the
natural
affection
of
a
true
and
earnest
nature
turn
to
agony
;
and
slight
,
or
stern
repulse
,
substitute
for
the
tender
protection
and
the
dear
care
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
hard
to
feel
in
her
deep
heart
what
she
have
feel
,
and
never
know
the
happiness
of
one
touch
of
response
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
much
more
hard
to
be
compel
to
doubt
either
her
father
or
Edith
,
so
affectionate
and
dear
to
her
,
and
to
think
of
her
love
for
each
of
them
,
by
turn
,
with
fear
,
distrust
,
and
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
yet
Florence
now
begin
to
do
so
;
and
the
doing
of
it
be
a
task
impose
upon
her
by
the
very
purity
of
her
soul
,
as
one
she
could
not
fly
from
.
<EOS>
She
see
her
father
cold
and
obdurate
to
Edith
,
as
to
her
;
hard
,
inflexible
,
unyielding
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
,
she
ask
herself
with
start
tear
,
that
her
own
dear
mother
have
be
make
unhappy
by
such
treatment
,
and
have
pine
away
and
die
?
<EOS>
then
she
would
think
how
proud
and
stately
Edith
be
to
every
one
but
her
,
with
what
disdain
<EOS>
she
treat
him
,
how
distantly
she
keep
apart
from
him
,
and
what
she
have
say
on
the
night
when
she
come
home
;
and
quickly
it
would
come
on
Florence
,
almost
as
a
crime
,
that
she
love
one
who
be
set
in
opposition
to
her
father
,
and
that
her
father
know
of
it
,
must
think
of
her
in
his
solitary
room
as
the
unnatural
child
who
add
this
wrong
to
the
old
fault
,
so
much
weep
for
,
of
never
have
win
his
fatherly
affection
from
her
birth
.
<EOS>
the
next
kind
word
from
Edith
,
the
next
kind
glance
,
would
shake
these
thought
again
,
and
make
them
seem
like
black
ingratitude
;
for
who
<EOS>
but
she
have
cheer
the
droop
heart
of
Florence
,
so
lonely
and
so
hurt
,
and
be
its
good
of
comforter
!
<EOS>
thus
,
with
her
gentle
nature
yearn
to
them
both
,
feel
the
misery
of
both
,
and
whisper
doubt
of
her
own
duty
to
both
,
Florence
in
her
wide
and
expand
love
,
and
by
the
side
of
Edith
,
endure
more
than
when
she
have
hoard
up
her
undivided
secret
in
the
mournful
house
,
and
her
beautiful
Mama
have
never
dawn
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
one
exquisite
unhappiness
that
would
have
far
outweigh
this
,
Florence
be
spare
.
<EOS>
She
never
have
the
least
suspicion
that
Edith
by
her
tenderness
for
her
widen
the
separation
from
her
father
,
or
give
him
new
cause
of
dislike
.
<EOS>
if
Florence
have
conceive
the
possibility
of
such
an
effect
be
work
by
such
a
cause
,
what
grief
she
would
have
feel
,
what
sacrifice
she
would
have
try
to
make
,
poor
loving
girl
,
how
fast
and
sure
her
quiet
passage
may
have
be
beneath
it
to
the
presence
of
that
high
Father
who
do
not
reject
his
child
's
love
,
or
spurn
their
try
and
break
heart
,
Heaven
knows!But
<EOS>
it
be
otherwise
,
and
that
be
well
.
  
<EOS>
no
word
be
ever
speak
between
Florence
and
Edith
now
,
on
these
subject
.
<EOS>
Edith
have
say
there
ought
to
be
between
them
,
in
that
wise
,
a
division
and
a
silence
like
the
grave
itself
:
and
Florence
feel
that
she
be
right
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
state
of
affair
her
father
be
bring
home
suffering
and
disable
:
and
gloomily
retire
to
his

room
,
where
he

tend
by

not

and

"
  
<EOS>
Susan
be
unusually
emphatic
and
destitute
of
punctuation
in
her
discourse
on
this
night
,
which
be
the
night
of
Mr
Dombey
's
be
bring
home
,
because
,
have
be
send
down
stair
by
Florence
to
inquire
after
him
,
she
have
be
oblige
to
deliver
her
message
to
her
mortal
enemy
Mrs
Pipchin
;
who
,
without
carry
it
in
to
Mr
Dombey
,
have
take
upon
herself
to
return
what
Miss
Nipper
call
a
huffish
answer
,
on
her
own
responsibility
.
<EOS>
this
,
Susan
Nipper
construe
into
presumption
on
the
part
of
that
exemplary
sufferer
by
the
peruvian
mine
,
and
a
deed
of
disparagement
upon
her
young
lady
,
that
be
not
to
be
forgive
;
and
so
far
her
emphatic
state
be
special
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
be
in
a
condition
of
greatly
increase
suspicion
and
distrust
,
ever
since
the
marriage
;
for
,
like
most
person
of
her
quality
of
mind
,
who
form
a
strong
and
sincere
attachment
to
one
in
the
different
station
which
Florence
occupy
,
Susan
be
very
jealous
,
and
her
jealousy
naturally
attach
to
Edith
,
who
divide
her
old
empire
,
and
come
between
them
.
<EOS>
proud
and
glad
as
Susan
Nipper
truly
be
,
that
her
young
mistress
should
be
advance
towards
her
proper
place
in
the
scene
of
her
old
neglect
,
and
that
she
should
have
her
father
's
handsome
wife
for
her
companion

protectress
<EOS>
,
she
could
not
relinquish
any
part
of
her
own
dominion
to
the
handsome
wife
,
without
a
grudge
and
a
vague
feeling
of
ill

will
,
for
which
she
do
not
fail
to
find
a
disinterested
justification
in
her
sharp
perception
of
the
pride

passion
of
the
lady
's
character

<EOS>
from
the
background
to
which
she
have
necessarily
retire
somewhat
,
since
the
marriage
,
Miss
Nipper
look
on
,
therefore
,
at
domestic
affair
in
general
,
with
a
resolute
conviction
that
no
good

come
of
Mrs

:
always
be
very
careful
to
publish
on
all
possible
occasion

<EOS>
and
look
up
,
she
put
her
arm
<EOS>
round
the
neck
of
her
humble
friend
,
draw
her
face
down
to
hers

and
bid
her
good

so
mollified

fall
a
sobbing

myself
in
the

Mama
have
be
down

I
dare

;

Florence
blush

for
she

no

or
be
there
now
,
perhaps
,
good
night

<EOS>
Susan
be
too
much
soften
to
express
her
private
opinion
on
the
probability
of
Mrs
Dombey
's
being
in
attendance
on
her
husband
;
and
silently
withdraw
.
<EOS>
Florence
leave
alone
,
soon
hide
her
head
upon
her
hand
as
she
have
often
do
in
other
day
,
and
do
not
restrain
the
tear
from
course
down
her
face
.
<EOS>
the
misery
of
this
domestic
discord
and
unhappiness
;
the
withered
hope
she
cherish
now
,
if
hope
it
could
be
call
,
of
ever
be
take
to
her
father
's
heart
;
her
doubt
and
fear
between
the
two
;
the
yearning
of
her
innocent
breast
to
both
;
the
heavy
disappointment
and
regret
of
such
an
end
as
this
,
to
what
have
be
a
vision
of
bright
hope
and
promise
to
her
;
all
crowd
on
her
mind
and
make
her
tear
flow
fast
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
and
her
brother
dead
,
her
father
unmove
towards
her
,
<EOS>
Edith
oppose
to
him
and
cast
him
away
,
but
love
her
,
and
love
by
her
<EOS>
,
it
seem
as
if
her
affection
could
never
prosper
,
rest
where
it
would
.
<EOS>
that
weak
thought
be
soon
hush
,
but
the
thought
in
which
it
have
arise
be
too
true
and
strong
to
be
dismiss
with
it
;
and
they
make
the
night
desolate
.
  
<EOS>
among
such
reflection
there
rise
up
,
as
there
have
rise
up
all
day
,
the
image
of
her
father
,
wound
and
in
pain
,
alone
in
his
own
room
,
untende
by
those
who
should
be
near
to
him
,
and
pass
the
tardy
hour
in
lonely
suffering
.
<EOS>
a
frightened
thought
which
make
her
start
and
clasp
her
hand
 
---
though
it
be
not
a
new
one
in
her
mind
---
that
the
may
die
,
and
never
see
her
or
pronounce
her
name
,
thrill
her
whole
frame
.
<EOS>
in
her
agitation
she
think
,
and
tremble
while
she
think
,
of
once
more
steal
down
stair
,
and
venture
to
his
door
.
  
<EOS>
She
listen
at
her
own
.
<EOS>
the
house
be
quiet
,
and
all
the
light
be
out
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
,
long
time
,
she
think
,
since
she
use
to
make
her
nightly
pilgrimage
to
his
door
!
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
,
long
time
,
she
try
to
think
,
since
she
have
enter
his
room
at
midnight
,
and
he
have
lead
her
back
to
the
stair
-
foot
!
  
<EOS>
with
the
same
child
's
heart
within
her
,
as
of
old
:
even
with
the
child
's
sweet
timid
eye
and
cluster
hair
:
Florence
,
as
strange
to
her
father
in
her
early
maiden
bloom
,
as
in
her
nursery
time
,
creep
down
the
staircase
listen
as
she
go
,
and
draw
near
to
his
room
.
<EOS>
no
one
be
stir
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
the
door
be
party
open
to
admit
air
;
and
all
be
so
still
within
,
that
she
could
hear
the
burning
of
the
fire
,
and
count
the
ticking
of
the
clock
that
stand
upon
the
chimney
-
piece
.
  
<EOS>
She
look
in
.
<EOS>
in
that
room
,
the
housekeeper
wrap
in
a
blanket
be
fast
asleep
in
an
easy
chair
before
the
fire
.
<EOS>
the
door
between
it
and
the
next
be
partly
closed
,
and
a
screen
be
draw
before
them
;
but
there
be
a
light
there
,
and
it
shine
upon
the
cornice
of
his
bed
.
<EOS>
all
be
so
very
still
that
she
could
hear
from
his
breathing
that
he
be
asleep
.
<EOS>
this
give
her
courage
to
pass
round
the
screen
,
and
look
into
his
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
as
great
a
start
to
come
upon
his
sleep
face
as
if
she
have
not
expect
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
Florence
stand
arrest
on
the
spot
,
and
if
he
have
awaken
then
,
must
have
remain
there
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
cut
upon
his
forehead
,
and
they
have
be
wet
his
hair
,
which
lie
bedabble
and
entangle
on
the
pillow
.
<EOS>
one
of
his
arm
,
rest
outside
the
bed
,
be
bandage
up
,
and
he
be
very
white
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
this
,
that
after
the
first
quick
glance
,
and
first
assurance
of
his
sleeping
quietly
,
hold
Florence
root
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
It
be
something
very
different
from
this
,
and
more
than
this
,
that
make
him
look
so
solemn
in
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
never
see
his
face
in
all
her
life
,
but
there
have
be
upon
it
---
or
she
fancy
so
---
some
disturb
consciousness
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
see
his
face
in
all
her
life
,
but
hope
have
sink
within
her
,
and
her
timid
glance
have
droop
before
its
stern
,
unloving
,
and
repelling
harshness
.
<EOS>
as
she
look
upon
it
now
,
she
see
it
,
for
the
first
time
,
free
from
the
cloud
that
have
darken
her
childhood
.
<EOS>
calm
,
tranquil
night
be
reign
in
its
stead
.
<EOS>
Her
may
have
go
to
sleep
,
for
anything
she
see
there
,
bless
her
.
  
<EOS>
Awake
,
unkind
father
!
<EOS>
awake
,
now
,
sullen
man
!
<EOS>
the
time
be
flit
by
;
the
hour
be
come
with
an
angry
tread
.
<EOS>
awake
!
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
change
upon
his
face
;
and
as
she
watch
it
,
awfully
,
its
motionless
repose
recall
the
face
that
be
go
.
<EOS>
so
they
look
,
so
would
he
;
so
<EOS>
she
,
his
weep
child
,
who
should
say
when
!
<EOS>
so
all
the
world
of
love
and
hatred
and
indifference
around
them
!
<EOS>
when
that
time
should
come
,
it
would
not
be
the
heavy
to
him
,
for
this
that
she
be
go
to
do
;
and
it
may
fall
something
light
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
steal
close
to
the
bed
,
and
draw
in
her
breath
bend
down
,
and
softly
kiss
him
on
the
face
,
and
lay
her
own
for
one
brief
moment
by
its
side
,
and
put
the
arm
,
with
which
she
dare
not
touch
him
,
round
about
him
on
the
pillow
.
  
<EOS>
Awake
,
doomed
man
,
while
she
be
near

<EOS>
the
time
be
flit
by

the
hour
be
come
with
an
angry
tread
;
its
food
be
in
the
house

<EOS>
awake
!
  
<EOS>
in
her
mind
,
she
pray
to
God
to
bless
her
father
,
and
to
soften
him
towards
her
,
if
it
may
be
so
;
and
if
not
,
to
forgive
him
if
he
be
wrong
,
and
pardon
her
the
prayer
which
almost
seem
impiety

<EOS>
and
do
so

and
look
back
at
him
with
blinded
eye
,
and
steal
timidly
away
,
pass
out
of
his
room
,
and
cross
the
other

and
be

.
  
<EOS>
He
may
sleep
on

<EOS>
He
may
sleep
on

<EOS>
but
let
him
look
for
that
slight
figure
when
he
wake
,
and
find
it
near
him
when
the
hour
be
come
!
  
<EOS>
Sad
and
grieving
be
the
heart
of
Florence
,
as
she
creep
upstairs
.
<EOS>
the
quiet
house
have
grow
more
dismal
since

down

<EOS>
the
sleep

have
be
look
on
,
in
the
dead
on
night
,
have
the
solemnity
to
her
of
death
and
life
in
one
.
<EOS>
the
secrecy
and
silence
of
her
own
proceeding
make
the
night
secret
,
silent
,
and
oppressive
.
<EOS>
She
feel
unwilling
,
almost
unable
,
to
go
on
to
her
own
chamber
;
and
turn
into
the
drawing

room
,
where
the
clouded
moon
be

through
the

look
out
into
the
empty
street

the
wind
be
blow
drearily

<EOS>
the
lamp

pale

and
shake
as

<EOS>
there
be
a
distant
glimmer
of
something
that
be
not
quite
darkness
,
rather
than
of
light
,
in
the
sky
;
and
foreboding
night
be
shiver
and
restless
,
as
the
dying
be
who
make
a
troubled
end
.
<EOS>
Florence
remember
how
,
as
a
watcher
,
by
a
sick

bed
,
she
have
note
this
bleak
time

and
feel
its
influence
,
as
if

natural
antipathy
to

and
now
it
be
very
,
very
gloomy

break
the
spell
of
gloom
and
silence
,
Florence

her
step
towards

<EOS>
the

She

through
many
shameful

never

except
upon
itself

debase

boldly
to
resent

a

word
she

a

<EOS>
soon
she
grow
calm
,

be
full
of
pity
for
the
tear
of
Florence

for
her
wake
at
such
untimely
hour

and
the
day
now
draw

Edith
fold
her
in

lay
her
down
upon

,
not

down

sit
by

her
try
to
sleep

I
be
indeed
unhappy

to

you

They
kiss
each
other
,
and
Florence
,
wear
out
,
gradually
fall
into
a
gentle
slumber
;
but
as
her
eye
close
on
the
face
beside
her
,
it
be
so
sad
to
think
upon
the
face
down
stair
,
that
her
hand
draw
closer
to
Edith
for
some
comfort
;
yet
,
even
in
the
act
,
it
falter
,
lest
it
should
he
desert
him
.
<EOS>
so
,
in
her
sleep
,
she
try
to
reconcile
the
two
together
,
and
to
show
them
that
she
love
them
both
,
but
could
not
do
it
,
and
her
wake
grief
be
part
of
her
dream

<EOS>
Edith
,
sit
by
,
look
down
at
the
dark
eyelash
lie
wet
on
the
flushed
cheek
,
and
look
with
gentleness
and
pity
,
for
she
know
the
truth
.
<EOS>
but
no
sleep
hang
upon
her
own
eye
.
<EOS>
as
the
day
come
on
she
still
sit
watch
and
wake
,
with
the
placid
hand
in
hers
,
and
sometimes
whisper
,
as
she
look
at
the
hushed
face
,
"
be

I

no

though
not
so
early
as
the
sun

uprose
Miss
Susan
Nipper
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
heaviness
in
this
young
maiden

exceedingly
sharp
black
eye
,
that
abate
somewhat
of
their
sparkling
,
and
suggest
---
which

the
possibility

sometimes
shut

there

<EOS>
this
be
noticeable
even
in

more

and
in
occasional
twitch
of
her
head
as
she
go
about
the
house

which

mightily
expressive
of
determination

<EOS>
in
a

she
have
form
a
determination

an
aspire
one
:
it

nothing

to
penetrate
to
Mr

just

because
he
intend

I
shall
be
a
punishment

your
contumacy

he
really
do
consider

obtuse

forbid

I

I
must
entreat
you
in

after

hesitation

each
other
as
before

I
be
in
a
difficulty
here

You
have
tell
me
you
will
receive
no
message

you
have
forbid
me
to
return
to

subject

the

that

vague
caution
from

have
now
the
honour
to
possess
your
confidence

the
way
to

His

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
the
urgency
of
this

say
Mr

because
it
be
impossible

may
arise

I

<EOS>
look
at
him
still
with
the

apparent
dread
of
release
him
for
a
moment
from
the
influence

steady
gaze

turn
back

gloved
hand

have
maim

He
take
it
in

<EOS>
though
not

It

that
Jem

the
only
decide
alteration
in

that
as

he
would
fall

ejaculation

a

shake
Mrs

Mrs

a
moan

without

the
astonished
and
dismay

stare
after
them

see
that
they
stop

fall
to
earnest
conversation
very
soon
;

more
than
once
observe
a
darkly
threaten
action
of
the
young
woman
's
hand
(
obviously
have
reference
to
some
one
of
whom
they
speak
)
,
and
a
croon
feeble
imitation
of
it
on
the
part
of
Mrs
Brown
,
that
make
him
earnestly
hope
he
may
not
be
the
subject
of
their
discourse
.
  
<EOS>
with
the
present
consolation
that
they
be
go
,

with
the
prospective
comfort
that
Mrs
Brown
could
not
live
for
ever
,
and
be
not
likely
to
live
long
to
trouble
him
,
the
Grinder

not
otherwise
regret
his
misdeed

as
they
be
attend
with
such
disagreeable
incidental
consequence

compose
his
ruffled
feature
to
a
more
serene
expression
by
think
of
the
admirable
manner
in
which
he
have
dispose
of
Captain
Cuttle
(
a
reflection
that
seldom
fail
to
put
him
in
a
flow
of
spirit

,

go
to
the
Dombey
Counting
House
to
receive
his
master

there
his

so
subtle

vigilant

that
Rob

give
him
the
usual
morning
's
box
of
paper
for
Mr

a
note
for
Mrs
Dombey
:
merely
nod
his
head
as
an
enjoinder
to
be
careful
,
and
to
use
dispatch
---
a
mysterious
admonition
,
fraught
in
the
Grinder
's
imagination
with
dismal
warning
and
threat
;
and
more
powerful
with
him
than
any
word

<EOS>
alone
again

in

himself

when

from

associate
with
it
be
a
certain
stately
presence

a
gloved

the
remembrance
how
the
feather
of
a
beautiful
bird
's
wing
have
be
shower
down
upon
the
floor
,
and
how
the
light
white
down
upon

robe
have
stir

these

a

who
hate
him

who
by
slow

sure
degree
have
be
lead
on
by
his
craft
,

her
pride

resentment
,
to
endure
his
company
,

little
by
little
to
receive
him
as
one
who
have
the
privilege
to
talk
to
her
of
her
own
defiant
disregard
of
her
own
husband

her
abandonment

They

hate

deeply
,

who
know

who
mistrust
him
because
she
know
him

because
he
know

who
feed

fierce
resentment

suffer
him
to
draw
near

near

in

the
hate

<EOS>
in
spite
of
it
!
<EOS>
for
that
very
reason

in

depth

too
far
down
for
her

though
she
could

dimly

lie
the
dark
retaliation
,
whose
faint
shadow

at

would
have
be
sufficient
stain

the
phantom

such
a

on

true

the
reality

obvious
to
him
?
  
<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
He
be
her
in

exactly
as

She
bear
him
company
with
her
pride
,
resentment
,
hatred
,
all
as
plain
to
him
as
her
beauty
;
with
nothing
plainer
to
him
than
her
hatred
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
see
her
sometimes
haughty
and
repellent
at
his
side
,
and
sometimes
down
among
his
horse
's
foot
,
fall
and
in
the
dust
.
<EOS>
but
he
always
see
her
as
she
be
,
without
disguise
,
and
watch
her
on
the
dangerous
way
that
she
be
go
.

over

newly
dress

and
come
into
the
light
of
her
bright
room
with
his
bent
head
,
soft
voice
,
and
soothing
smile
,
he
see
her
yet
as
plainly
.
<EOS>
He
even
suspect
the
mystery
of
the
gloved
hand
,
and
hold
it
all
the
long
in
his
own
for
that
suspicion
.
<EOS>
upon
the
dangerous
way
that
she
be
go
,
he
be
still
;
and
not
a
footprint
<EOS>
do
she
mark
upon
it
,
but
he
set
his
own
there

straight

surprise

;
and
hear
voice
that
be
strange
to
her
ask
her
where
she
go

what
the
matter
be
;
and
though
these
frighten
her
the
more
at
first

and
make
her
hurry
on
the
faster
,
they
do
her
the
good
service
of
recall
her
in
some
degree
to
herself

to
see
the

"
   
<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
pat
Diogenes
when
he
make
allusion
to
him
,
and
Diogenes
meet
that
overture
graciously
,
half
-
way
.
<EOS>
during
the
administration
of
the
restorative
he
have
clearly
be
in
two
mind
whether
to
fly
at
the
Captain
or
to
offer
him
his
friendship
;
and
he
have
express
that
conflict
of
feeling
by
alternate
wagging
of
his
tail
,
and
display
of
his
tooth
,
with
now
and
then
a
growl
or
so
.
<EOS>
but
by
this
time
his
doubt
be
all
remove
.
<EOS>
It
be
plain
that
he
consider
the
Captain
one
of
the
most
amiable
of
man
,
and
a
man
whom
it
be
an
honour
to
a
dog
to
know
.
  
<EOS>
in
evidence
of
these
conviction
,

on
the
Captain
while
he
make
some
tea
and
toast
,
and
show
a
lively
interest
in
his
housekeeping

<EOS>
but
it
be
in
vain
for
the
kind
captain
to
make
such
preparation
for
Florence
,
who
sorely
try
to
do
some
honour
to
them
,
but
could
touch
nothing
,
and
could
only
weep
and
weep
again

<EOS>
"

up

dart
to

furiously

It

<EOS>
but
for
all
that
,
Diogenes
bark
and
bark
,
and
burrow
and
burrow
,
with
pertinacious
fury
;
and
whenever
he
stop
to
listen

appear
to

some
new
conviction
into

a
dozen
time

<EOS>
even
when

he
come
jog
back
to
it

with
a
very
doubtful
air
;
and
be
off
again
,
in
another
paroxysm
,
before

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
the
Captain
be
greatly

by
this
reply
,
and
express
his
satisfaction
by
take
off
his
hard
glaze
hat
,
and
dab
his
head
all
over
with
his
handkerchief
,
roll
up
like
a
ball
,
observe
several
time
,
with
infinite
complacency
,
and
with
a
beam
countenance
,
that
he
know'd
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
you
be
quiet
now
,
be
you
,
brother
?
"
say
the
Captain
to
Diogenes
.
<EOS>
"
there
warn't
nobody
there
,
my
lady
lass
,
bless
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
diogene
be
not
so
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
the
door
still
have
an
attraction
for
him
at
interval
;
and
he
go
snuff
about
it
,
and
growl
to
himself
,
unable
to
forget
the
subject
.
<EOS>
this
incident
,
couple
with
the
Captain
's
observation
of
Florence
's
fatigue
and
faintness
,
decide
him
to
prepare
Sol
Gills
's
chamber
as
a
place
of
retirement
for
her
immediately
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
hastily
betook
himself
to
the
top
of
the
house
,
and
make
the
good
arrangement
of
it
that
his
imagination
and
his
mean
suggest
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
clean
already
;
and
the
Captain
be
an
orderly
man
,
and
accustom
to
make
thing
ship
-
shape
,
convert
the
bed
into
a
couch
,
by
cover
it
all
over
with
a
clean
white
drapery
.
<EOS>
by
a
similar
contrivance
,
the
Captain
convert
the
little
dressing
-
table
into
a
species
of
alter
,
on
which
he
set
forth
two
silver
teaspoon
,
a
flower
-
pot
,
a
telescope
,
his
celebrated
watch
,
a
pocket
-
comb
,
and
a
song
-
book
,
as
a
small
collection
of
rarity
,
that
make
a
choice
appearance
.
<EOS>
have
darken
the
window
,
and
straighten
the
piece
of
carpet
on
the
floor
,
the
Captain
survey
these
preparation
with
great
delight
,
and
descend
to
the
little
parlour
again
,
to
bring
Florence
to
her
bower
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
would
induce
the
Captain
to
believe
that
it
be
possible
for
Florence
to
walk
upstairs
.
<EOS>
if
he
could
have
get
the
idea
into
his
head
,
he
would
have
consider
it
an
outrageous
breach
of
hospitality
to
allow
her
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Florence
be
too
weak
to
dispute
the
point
,
and
the
Captain
carry
her
up
out
of
hand
,
lay
her
down
,
and
cover
her
with
a
great
watch
-
coat
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lady
lass
!
"
say
the
Captain
,
"
you
be

cast
off

<EOS>
the

conclude
by
kiss
the
hand
that

stretch
out
to
him
,
with
the
chivalry
of

old
knight

and
satisfy
himself
that
now

at

accordingly
he
set

open
,
and
stand
upon
the
threshold
,
keep
a
bright
look

out

and
sweep
the

<EOS>
the
Captain
,
divide
between
his
fear
of
compromise
Florence
in
some
way
by
not
go
,
and
his
horror
of
leave
Mr
Toots
in
possession
of
the
house
with
a
chance
of
find
out
the
secret
,
be
a
spectacle
of
mental
disturbance
that
even
Mr

could
not
be
blind
to
.
<EOS>
but
that
young
gentleman
,
consider
his
nautical
friend
as
merely
in

state
of
preparation
for
the
interview
he
be
go
to
have
,
be
quite
satisfied
,
and
do
not
review
his
own
discreet
conduct
without
chuckle
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
the
Captain
decide
,
as
the
less
of
two
evil
,
to
run
round
to
Brogley

the
Broker
's
:
previously
lock
the
door
that
communicate
with
the
upper
part
of

house

put
the
key
in
his
pocket

"

the

to
Mr

hesitation

thank
him
heartily

that
five
minute

go
out
in
quest
of
the

intrust
Mr

poor
Mr

leave

lie
down

little
thinking

<EOS>
Captain
Cuttle
cordially
reciprocate
the
warmth
of
Mr
Toots
's
farewell
,
lock
the
door
behind
him
,
and
shake
his
head
with
the
same
remarkable
expression
of
pity
and
tenderness
as
he
have
regard
him
with
before
,
go
up
to
see
if
Florence
want
him
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
an
entire
change
in
the
Captain
's
face
as
he
go
upstairs
.
<EOS>
He
wipe
his
eye
with
his
handkerchief
,
and
he
polish
the
bridge
of
his
nose
with
his
sleeve
as
he
have
do
already
that
morning
,
but
his
face
be
absolutely
change
.
<EOS>
now
,
he
may
have
be
think
supremely
happy
;
now
,
he
may
have
be
think
sad
;
but
the
kind
of
gravity
that
sit
upon
his
feature
be
quite
new
to
them
,
and
be
as
great
an
improvement
to
them
as
if
they
have
undergo
some
sublimating
process
.
  
<EOS>
He
knock
softly
,
with
his
hook
,
at
Florence
's
door
,
twice
or
thrice
;
but
,
receive
no
answer
,
venture
first
to
peep
in
,
and
then
to
enter
:
emboldened
to
take
the
latter
step
,
perhaps
,
by
the
familiar
recognition
of
Diogenes
,
who
,
stretch
upon
the
ground
by
the
side
of
her
couch
,
wag
his
tail
,
and
wink
his
eye
at
the
Captain
,
without
be
at
the
trouble
of
get
up
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
sleep
heavily
,
and
moan
in
her
sleep
;
and
Captain
Cuttle
,
with
a
perfect
awe
of
her
youth
and
beauty
,
and
her
sorrow
,
raise
her
head
,
and
adjust
the
coat
that
cover
her
,
where
it
have
fall
off
,
and
darken
the
window
a
little
more
that
she
may
sleep
on
,
and
creep
out
again
,
and
take
his
post
of
watch
upon
the
stair
.
<EOS>
all
this
,
with
a
touch
and
tread
as
light
as
Florence
's
own
.
  
<EOS>
long
may
it
remain
in
this
mixed
world
a
point
not
easy
of
decision
,
which
be
the
more
beautiful
evidence
of
the
Almighty
's
goodness
---
the
delicate
finger
that
be
form
for
sensitiveness
and
sympathy
of
touch
,
and
make
to
minister
to
pain

grief
,

the
rough
hard
Captain

in
a
moment

<EOS>
Florence
sleep
upon
her
couch

forgetful
of
her
homelessness
and
orphanage
,
and
Captain
Cuttle

upon
the
stair

<EOS>
a
loud
sob
or
moan
than
usual
,
bring
him
sometimes
to
her

by
degree
she
sleep
more
peacefully
,

undisturbed

uneasy
in

body

she
sleep
on

unconscious
of
her
strange
bed
,
of
the
noise
and
turmoil
in
the
street

of
the
light
that
shine
outside

perfect
unconsciousness

dull

always
present
to

pale
cheek

wet

in

work
in

of
city

as

with
golden
arrow

strike
through

through

and
far
away
athwart
the
river
and
its
flat
blank
,
it
be
gleam
like
a
path
of
fire
---
and
<EOS>
out
at
sea
it
be
irradiate
sail
of
ship
---
and
,
look
towards
,
from
quiet
churchyard
,
upon
hill

top
in

it

steep
distant
prospect
in
a
flush
and
glow
that

to
mingle
earth

together

glorious
suffusion

open
her
heavy
eye

lie
at
first
,
look
without
interest
or
recognition
at
the
unfamiliar
wall
around
her

and
listen
in
the

regardless
manner
to
the
noise
in
the
street

presently
she
start
up
upon
her
couch

gaze
round
with
a
surprised

<EOS>
Florence
,
with
her
hand
upon
the
Captain
's
arm
,
so
sorrowful
and
timid
,
and
the
captain
with
his
rough
face
and
burly
figure
,
so
quietly
protective
of
her
,
stand
in
the
rosy
light
of
the
bright
evening
sky
,
without
say
a
word
.
<EOS>
however
strange
the
form
of
speech
into
which
he
may
have
fashion
the
feeling
,
if
he
have
have
to
give
it
utterance
,
the
Captain
feel
,
as
sensibly
as
the
most
eloquent
of
man
could
have
do
,
that
there
be
something
in
the
tranquil
time
and
in
its
softened
beauty
that
would
make
the
wounded
heart
of
Florence
overflow
;
and
that
it
be
well
that
such
tear
should
have
their
way
.
<EOS>
so
not
a
word
spake
Captain
Cuttle
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
feel
his
arm
clasp
closer
,
and
when
he
feel
the
lonely
head
come
nearer
to
it
,
and
lie
itself
against
his
homely
coarse
blue
sleeve
,
he
press
it
gently
with
his
rugged
hand
,
and
understand
it
,
and
be
understand
.
  
<EOS>
"

my
pretty

say
the
Captain

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
cheerily

cheerily
;
I
will
go
down
below

and
get
some
dinner
ready

<EOS>
Will
you

down
of
your

Cuttle

"
  
<EOS>
as
Florence
assure
him
that
she
be
quite
able
to
walk
down
stair
,
the
Captain
,
though
evidently
doubtful
of
his
own
hospitality
in
permit
it
,
leave
her
to
do
so
,
and
immediately
set
about
roast
a
fowl
at
the
fire
in
the
little
parlour
.
<EOS>
to
achieve
his
cookery
with
the
great
skill
,
he
pull
off
his
coat
,
tuck
up
his
wristband
,
and
put
on
his
glaze
hat
,
without
which
assistant
he
never
apply
himself
to
any
nice
or
difficult
undertaking
.
  
<EOS>
after
cool
her
ache
head
and
burn
face
in
the
fresh
water
which
the
Captain
's
care
have
provide
for
her
while
she
sleep
,
Florence
go
to
the
little
mirror
to
bind
up
her
disorder
hair
.
<EOS>
then
she
know
---
in
a
moment
,
for
she
shun
it
instantly
---
that
on
her
breast
there
be
the
darkening
mark
of
any
angry
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Her
tear
burst
forth
afresh
at
the
sight
;
she
be
ashamed
and
afraid
of
it
;
but
it
move
her
to
no
anger
against
him
.
<EOS>
homeless
and
fatherless
<EOS>
,
she
forgive
him
everything
;
hardly
think
that
she
have
nee
to
forgive
him
,
or
that
she
do
;
but
she
flee
from
the
idea
of
him
as
she
have
flee
from
the
reality
,
and
he
be
utterly
go
and
lose
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
such
be
in
the
world

<EOS>
what
to
do
,
or
where
to
live
,
Florence
---
poor
,
inexperienced
girl
!
<EOS>
---
could
not
yet
consider
.
<EOS>
She
have
indistinct
dream
of
finding
,
a
long
way
off
,
some
little
sister
to
instruct
,
who
would
be
gentle
with
her
,
and
to
whom
,
under
some
feign
name
,
she
may
attach
herself
,
and
who
would
grow
up
in
their
happy
home
,
and
marry
,
and
be
good
to
their
old
governess
,
and
perhaps
intrust
her
,
in
time
,
with
the
education
of
their
own
daughter
.
<EOS>
and
she
think
how
strange
and
sorrowful
it
would
be
,
thus
to
become
a
grey
-
haired
woman
,
carry
her
secret
to
the
grave
,
when
Florence
Dombey
be
forget
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
all
dim
and
cloud
to
her
now
.
<EOS>
She
only
know
that
she
have
no
Father
upon
earth
,
and
she
say
so
,
many
time
,
with
her
suppliant
head
hide
from
all
,
but
her
Father
who
be
in
Heaven
.
  
<EOS>
Her
little
stock
of
money
amount
to
<EOS>
but
a
few
guinea
.
<EOS>
with
a
part
of
this
,
it
would
be
necessary
to
buy
some
clothe
,
for
she
have
none
but
those
she
wear
.
<EOS>
She
be
too
desolate
to
think
how
soon
her
money
would
be
go
---
too
much
a
child
in
worldly
matter
to
be
greatly
troubled
on
that
score
yet
,
even
if
her
other
trouble
have
be
less
.
<EOS>
She
try
to
calm
her
thought
and
stay
her
tear
;
to
quiet
the
hurry
in
her
throbbing
head
,
and
bring
herself
to
believe
that
what
have
happen
be
<EOS>
but
the
event
of
a
few
hour
ago
,
instead
of
week
or
month
,
as
they
appear
;
and
go
down
to
her
kind
protector
.
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
have
spread
the
cloth
with
great
care
,
and
be
make
some
egg
-
sauce
in
a
little
saucepan
:
baste
the
fowl
from
time
to
time
during
the
process
with
a
strong
interest
,
as
it
turn
and
brown
on
a
string
before
the
fire
.
<EOS>
have
prop
Florence
up
with
cushion
on
the
sofa
,
which
be
already
wheel
into
a
warm
corner
for
her
great
comfort
,
the
Captain
pursue
his
cooking
with
extraordinary
skill
,
make
hot
gravy
in
a
second
little
saucepan
,
boil
a
handful
of
potato
in
a
third
,
never
forget
the
egg
-
sauce
in
the
first
,
and
make
an
impartial
round
of
basting
and
stir
with
the
most
useful
of
spoon
every
minute
.
<EOS>
besides
these
care
,
the
Captain
have
to
keep
his
eye
on
a
diminutive
fryingpan
,
in
which
some
sausage
be
hiss
and
bubble
in
a
most
musical
manner
;
and
there
be
never
such
a
radiant
cook
as
the
Captain
look
,
in
the
height
and
heat
of
these
function
:
it
be
impossible
to
say
whether
his
face

his

the

the
fowl

cold

stagnant

before

take
down
his

mantelshelf
give
it
into
his

him
to
smoke
it

so
bewilder
by

attention

he
hold
it
as

never

resume
her
place
on

old

with
a
smile
so
loving

so
grateful

a
smile
that
show
him
so
plainly
how
her
forlorn
heart
turn
to
him

as
her
face
do

through
grief

that
the
smoke
of
the
pipe
get
into

throat

make
him
cough

get
into
the

eye

<EOS>
the
manner

try
to
make
believe

the
cause

these
effect
lie
hide
in
the
pipe
itself

the
way
in

into

bowl
for
it

there

there

decided
contrast

,
and
smoke
,
and
look
at
Florence
,
God
know
what
impossible
picture
,
in
which
she
be
the
principal
figure
,
present
themselves
to
his
mind
.
<EOS>
equally
vague
and
uncertain
,
though
not
so
sanguine
,
be
her
own
thought
of
the
life
before
her
;
and
even
as
her
tear
make
prismatic
colour
in
the
light
she
gaze
at
so
,
through
her
new
and
heavy
grief
,
she
already
see
a
rainbow
faintly
shine
in
the
far
-
off
sky
.
<EOS>
a
wander
princess
and
a
good
monster
in
a
story
-
book
may
have
sit
by
the
fireside
,
and
talk
as
Captain
Cuttle
and
poor
Florence
think
---
and
not
have
look
very
much
unlike
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
be
not
trouble
with
the
faint
idea
of
any
difficulty
in
retain
Florence
,
or
of
any
responsibility
thereby
incur
.
<EOS>
have
put
up
the
shutter
and
lock
the
door
,
he
be
quite
satisfied
on
this
head
.
<EOS>
if
she
have
be
a
Ward
in
Chancery
,
it
would
have
make
no
difference
at
all
to
Captain
Cuttle
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
be
trouble
by
any
such
consideration
.
  
<EOS>
so
the
captain
smoke
his
pipe
very
comfortably
,
and
Florence
and
he
meditate
after
their
own
manner
.
<EOS>
when
the
pipe
be
out
,
they
have
some
tea
;
and
then
Florence
entreat
him
to
take
her
to
some
neighbouring
shop
,
where
she
could
buy
the
few
necessary
she
immediately
want
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
dark
,
the
Captain
consent
;
peep
carefully
out
first
,
as
he
have
be
will
not
to
do
in
his
time
of
hide
from
Mrs
MacStinger
;
and
arm
himself
with
his
large
stick
,
in
case
of
an
appeal
to
arm
be
render
necessary
by
any
unforeseen
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
the
pride
Captain
Cuttle
have
,
in
give
his
arm
to
Florence
,
and
escort
her
some
two
or
three
hundred
yard
,
keep
a
bright
look
-
out
all
the
time
,
and
attract
the
attention
of
every
one
who
pass
them
,
by
his
great
vigilance
and
numerous
precaution
,
be
extreme
.
<EOS>
arrive
at
the
shop
,
the
Captain
feel
it
a
point
of
delicacy
to
retire
during
the
making
of
the
purchase
,
as
they
be
to
consist
of
wear
apparel
;
but
he
previously
deposit
his
tin
canister
on
the
counter
,
and
inform
the
young
lady
of
the
establishment
that
it
contain
fourteen
pound
two
,
request
her
,
in
case
that
amount
of
property
should
not
be
sufficient
to
defray
the
expense
of
his
niece
's
little
outfit
---
at
the
word
"
niece
,
"
he
bestow
a
most
significant
look
on
Florence
,
accompany
with
pantomime
,
expressive
of
sagacity
and
mystery
---
to
have
the
goodness
to
"
sing
out
,
"
and
he
would
make
up
the
difference
from
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
casually
consult
his
big
watch
,
as
a
deep
mean
of
dazzle
the
establishment
,
and
impress
it
with
a
sense
of
property
,
the
Captain
then
kiss
his
hook
to
his
niece
,
and
retire
outside
the
window
,
where
it
be
a
choice
sight
to
see
his
great
face
look
in
from
time
to
time
,
among
the
silk
and
ribbon
,
with
an
obvious
misgiving
that
Florence
have
be
spirit
away
by
a
back
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
dear
Captain
Cuttle
,
"
say
Florence
,
when
she
come
out
with
a
parcel
,
the
size
of
which
greatly
disappoint
the
Captain
,
who
have
expect
to
see
a
porter
follow
with
a
bale
of
good
,
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
this
money
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
spend
any
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
money
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
lady
lass
,
"
return
the
baffle
Captain
,
look
straight
down
the
street
before
them
,
"
take
care
on
it
for
me
<EOS>
,
will
you
be
so
good
,
till
such
time
as
I
ask
ye
for
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
put
it
back
in
its
usual
place
,
"
say
Florence
,
"
and
keep
it
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
be
not
at
all
gratify
by
this
proposal
,
but
he
answer
,
"
<EOS>
aye
,
aye
,
put
it
anywhere
,
my
lady
lass
,
so
long
as
you
know
where
to
find
it
again
.
<EOS>
It
an't
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
no
use
to
me
,
"
say
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
I
have
not
chuck
it
away
afore
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
be
quite
dishearten
for
the
moment
,
but
he
revive
at
the
first
touch
of
Florence
's
arm
,
and
they
return
with
the
same
precaution
as
they
have
come
;
the
Captain
open
the
door
of
the
little
Midshipman
's
berth
,
and
diving
in
,
with
a
suddenness
which
his
great
practice
only
could
have
teach
him
.
<EOS>
during
Florence
's
slumber
in
the
morning
,
he
have
engage
the
daughter
of
an
elderly
lady
,
who
usually
sit
under
a
blue
umbrella
in
Leadenhall
Market
,
sell
poultry
,
to
come
and
put
her
room
in
order
,
and
render
her
any
little
service
she
require
;
and
this
damsel
now
appear
,
Florence
find
everything
about
her
as
convenient
and
orderly
,
if
not
as
handsome
,
as
in
the
terrible
dream
she
have
once
call
Home
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
be
alone
again
,
the
Captain
insist
on
her
eat
a
slice
of
dry
toast
,
and
drink
a
glass
of
spice
negus
(
which
he
make
to
perfection
)
;
and
,
encourage
her
with
every
kind
word
and
inconsequential
quotation
he
could
possibly
think
of
,
lead
her
upstairs
to
her
bedroom
.
<EOS>
but
he
too
have
something
on
his
mind
,
and
be
not
easy
in
his
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
night
,
dear
heart
,
"
say
Captain
Cuttle
to
her
at
her
chamber
-
door
.
   
<EOS>
Florence
raise
his
lip
to
his
face
,
and
kiss
him
.
  
<EOS>
at
any
other
time
the
Captain
would
have
be
overbalance
by
such
a
token
of
her
affection
and
gratitude
;
but
now
,
although
he
be
very
sensible
of
it
,
he
look
in
her
face
with
even
more
uneasiness
than
he
have
testify
before
,
and
seem
unwilling
to
leave
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
poor
Wal'r
!
"
say
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
poor
,
poor
Walter
!
<EOS>
"
sigh
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Drownded
,
an't
he
?
"
say
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
shake
her
head
,
and
sigh
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
night
,
my
lady
lass
!
"
say
Captain
Cuttle
,
put
out
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
dear
,
kind
friend

"
  
<EOS>
but
the
Captain
linger
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
anything
the
matter
,
dear
Captain
Cuttle
?
"
say
Florence
,
easily
alarm
in
her
then
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
you
anything
to
tell
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
to
tell
you
,
lady
lass

"
reply
the
Captain
,
meet
her
eye
in
confusion
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
no
;
what
should
I
have
to
tell
you
,
pretty
!
<EOS>
You
do
not
expect
as
I
have
get
anything
good
to
tell
you
,
sure
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
!
"
say
Florence
,
shake
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
look
at
her
wistfully
,
and
repeat
"
no
,
"
---
still
linger
,
and
still
show
embarrassment
.
  
<EOS>
"
poor
Wal'r
!
"
say
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
My
Wal'r
,
as
I
use
to
call
you
!
<EOS>
Old
Sol
Gills
's
nevy
!
<EOS>
welcome
to
all
as
know
you
,
as
the
flower
in
May
!
<EOS>
where
be
you
get
to
,
brave
boy
?
<EOS>
Drownded
,
an't
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
conclude
his
apostrophe
with
this
abrupt
appeal
to
Florence
,
the
Captain
bid
her
good
night
,
and
descend
the
stair
,
while
Florence
remain
at
the
top
,
hold
the
candle
out
to
light
him
down
.
<EOS>
He
be
lose
in
the
obscurity
,
and
,
judge
from
the
sound
of
his
recede
footstep
,
be
in
the
act
of
turn
into
the
little
parlour
,
when
his
head
and
shoulder
unexpectedly
emerge
again
,
as
from
the
deep
,
apparently
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
repeat
,
"
Drownded
,
an't
<EOS>
he
,
pretty
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
when
he
have
say
that
in
a
tone
of
tender
condolence
,
he
disappear
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
be
very
sorry
that
she
should
unwittingly
,
though
naturally
,
have
awaken
these
association
in
the
mind
of
her
protector
,
by
take
refuge
there
;
and
sit
down
before
the
little
table
where
the
Captain
have
arrange
the
telescope
and
song
-
book
,
and
those
other
rarity
,
think
of
Walter
,
and
of
all
that
be
connect
with
him
in
the
past
,
until
she
could
have
almost
wish
to
lie
down
on
her
bed
and
fade
away
.
<EOS>
but
in
her
lonely
yearning
to
the
dead
whom
she
have
love
,
no
thought
of
home
---
no
possibility
of
go
back
---
no
presentation
of
it
as
yet
exist
,
or
as
shelter
her
father
---
once
enter
her
thought
.
<EOS>
She
have
see
the
murder
do
.
<EOS>
in
the
last
linger
natural
aspect
in
which
she
have
cherish
him
through
so
much
,
he
have
be
tear
out
of
her
heart
,
deface
,
and
slay
.
<EOS>
the
thought
of
it
be
so
appalling
to
her
,
that
she
cover
her
eye
,
and
shrink
tremble
from
the
least
remembrance
of
the
deed
,
or
of
the
cruel
hand
that
do
it
.
<EOS>
if
her
fond
heart
could
have
hold
his
image
after
that
,
it
must
have
break
;
but
it
could
not
;
and
the
void
be
fill
with
a
wild
dread
that
flee
from
all
confronting
with
its
shattered
fragment
---
with
such
a
dread
as
could
have
rise
out
of
nothing
but
the
depth
of
such
a
love
,
so
wronged
.
  
<EOS>
She
dare
not
look
into
the
glass
;
for
the
sight
of
the
darkening
mark
upon
her
bosom
make
her
afraid
of
herself
,
as
if
she
bear
about
her
something
wicked
.
<EOS>
She
cover
it
up
,
with
a
hasty
,
faltering
hand
,
and
in
the
dark
;
and
lay
her
weary
head
down
,
weep
.
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
do
not
go
to
bed
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
He
walk
to
and
fro
in
the
shop
and
in
the
little
parlour
,
for
a
full
hour
,
and
,
appear
to
have
compose
himself
by
that
exercise
,
sit
down
with
a
grave
and
thoughtful
face
,
and
read
out
of
a
Prayer
-
book
<EOS>
the
form
of
prayer
appoint
to
be
use
at
sea
.
<EOS>
these
be
not
easily
dispose
of
;
the
good
captain
be
a
mighty
slow
,
gruff
reader
,
and
frequently
stop
at
a
hard
word
to
give
himself
such
encouragement
as
"
now
,
my
lad!with
a
will
!
"
<EOS>
or
,
"
steady
,
ed'ard
Cuttle
,
steady
!
"
which
have
a
great
effect
in
help
him
out
of
any
difficulty
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
his
spectacle
greatly
interfere
with
his
power
of
vision
.
<EOS>
but
notwithstanding
these
drawback
,
the
Captain
,
be
heartily
in
earnest
,
read
the
service
to
the
very
last
line
,
and
with
genuine
feeling
too
;
and
approve
of
it
very
much
when
he
have
do
,
turn
in
under
the
counter
(
but
not
before
he
have
be
upstairs
,
and
listen
at
Florence
's
door
)
,
with
a
serene
breast
,
and
a
most
benevolent
visage
.
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
turn
out
several
time
in
the
course
of
the
night
,
to
assure
himself
that
his
charge
be
rest
quietly
;
and
once
,
at
daybreak
,
find
that
she
be
awake
:
for
she
call
to
know
if
it
be
he
,
on
hear
footstep
near
her
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
my
lady
lass
,
"
reply
the
Captain
,
in
a
growl
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
be
you
all
right
,
di'mond
?
"
  
<EOS>
Florence
thank
him
,
and
say
"
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
could
not
lose
so
favourable
an
opportunity
of
apply
his
mouth
to
the
keyhole
,
and
call
through
it
,
like
a
hoarse
breeze
,
"
poor
Wal'r
!
<EOS>
Drownded
,
an't
he
?
"
<EOS>
after
which
he
withdraw
,
and
turn
in
again
,
sleep
till
seven
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
he
free
from
his
uneasy
and
embarrassed
manner
all
that
day
;
though
Florence
,
be
busy
with
her
needle
in
the
little
parlour
,
be
more
calm
and
tranquil
than
she
have
be
on
the
day
precede
.
<EOS>
almost
always
when
she
raise
her
eye
from
her
work
,
she
observe
the
Captain
look
at
her
,
and
thoughtfully
stroke
his
chin
;
and
he
so
often
hitch
his
arm
-
chair
close
to
her
,
as
if
he
be
go
to
say
something
very
confidential
,
and
hitch
it
away
again
,
as
not
be
able
to
make
up
his
mind
how
to
begin
,
that
in
the
course
of
the
day
he
cruise
completely
round
the
parlour
in
that
frail
bark
,
and
more
than
once
go
ashore
against
the
wainscot
or
the
closet
door
,
in
a
very
distressed
condition
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
the
twilight
that
Captain
Cuttle
,
fairly
drop
anchor
,
at
last
,
by
the
side
of
Florence
,
begin
to
talk
at
all
connectedly
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
light
of
the
fire
be
shine
on
the
wall
and
ceiling
of
the
little
room
,
and
on
the
teaboard
and
the
cup
and
saucer
that
be
range
upon
the
table
,
and
on
her
calm
face
turn
towards
the
flame
,
and
reflect
it
in
the
tear
that
fill
her
eye
,
the
Captain
break
a
long
silence
thus
:
  
"
You
never
be
at
sea
,
my
own
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
reply
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
aye
,
"
say
the
Captain
,
reverentially
;
"
it
be
a
almighty
element
.
<EOS>
there
be
wonder
in
the
deep
,
my
pretty
.
<EOS>
think
on
it
when
the
wind
be
roar
and
the
wave
be
rowle
.
<EOS>
think
on
it
when
the
stormy
night
be
so
pitch
dark
,
"
say
the
Captain
,
solemnly
hold
up
his
hook
,
"
as
you
can
not
see
your
hand
afore
you
,
except
when
the
wiwid
lightning
reweal
the
same
;
and
when
you
drive
,
drive
,
drive
through
the
storm
and
dark
,
as
if
you
be
a
driving
,
head
on
,
to
the
world
without
end
,
evermore
,
amen
,
and
when
find
make
a
note
of
.
<EOS>
Them
be
the
time

the
teaspoon

the
sugar
-
tong

canister

lay
them
on
the
table

sweep
them
with
his
great
hand
into
Walter

hat

in
handing
that
singular
strong
box
to
Walter

he
be
so
overcome
again

that
he
be
fain
to
make
another
retreat

absent
himself
for

long
space

time

first
retirement

Walter
seek
him
out

bring
him
back

then
the
Captain

great
apprehension
be
,
that

suffer
from
this
new
shock

feel
it
so
earnestly

rational

interdict
any
further
allusion

then
become
sufficiently
compose
to

himself

toast
in

to
take
his
place
at
the
teaboard
;

find
Walter
's
grasp
upon
his
shoulder
,
on
one
side
,
and
Florence
whisper
her
tearful
congratulation
on
the
other
,
the
Captain
suddenly
bolt
again
,

be
miss
for
a
good
ten
minute

but
never
in

have
the
Captain

face

so
shone

glisten

as
when

at

he
sit
stationary
at

tea

board

look
from

Walter

from
Walter

Florence

<EOS>
nor
be
this
effect
produce

at
all
heighten

immense
quantity

polishing

have
administer
to
his
face

his
coat

sleeve
during

last
half

hour

It
be
solely
the
effect

his
internal
emotion

there
be
a
glory
and
delight
within
the
Captain

spread
itself
over
his
whole
visage

make
a
perfect
illumination
there
.
  
<EOS>
the
pride
with
which
the
Captain
look
upon
the
bronze
cheek
and
the
courageous
eye
of
his
recover
boy
;
with
which
he
see
the
generous
fervour
of
his
youth
,
and
all
its
frank
and
hopeful
quality
,
shine
once
more
,
in
the
fresh
,
wholesome
manner
,
and
the
ardent
face
,
would
have
kindle
something
of
this
light
in
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
the
admiration
and
sympathy
with
which
he
turn
his
eye
on
Florence
,
whose
beauty
,
grace
,
and
innocence
could
have
win
no
truer
or
more
zealous
champion
than
himself
,
would
have
have
an
equal
influence
upon
him
.
<EOS>
but
the
fulness
of
the
glow
he
shed
around
him
could
only
have
be
engender
in
his
contemplation
of
the
two
together
,
and
in
all
the
fancy
spring
out
of
that
association
,
that
come
sparkle

beam
into

dance
about
it

talk
of
poor
old
Uncle
Sol

and
dwelt
on
every
little
circumstance
relate
to
his
disappearance
;
how
their
joy
be
moderate
by
the
old
man
's
absence
and
by
the
misfortune
of
Florence

how
they
release
Diogenes

whom
the

decoy
upstairs
some
time
before

should
bark
again

that
Walter

on
Florence

as

from

off

that
while
his

often
seek
the

they
seldom
meet
its
open
glance
of
sisterly
affection
,
but
withdraw
themselves
when

He

them
there
together
in

the

he
have
no

admiration
of
such

They
sit
thus
,
until
it

<EOS>
the
Captain

have
be
content
to
sit
so
for
a

He
know

<EOS>
Captain

perplex

verse
of
Lovely

but
it
stick
in
his
throat
somehow

he
could
make
nothing

so
he
go
to

dream

<EOS>
Mr
Toots
's
complaint
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
empty
room
above
-
stair
at
the
Wooden
Midshipman
's
,
which
,
in
day
of
yore
,
have
be
Walter
's
bedroom
.
<EOS>
Walter
,
rouse
up
the
Captain
betime
in
the
morning
,
propose
that
they
should
carry
thither
such
furniture
out
of
the
little
parlour
as
would
grace
it
best
,
so
that
Florence
may
take
possession
of
it
when
she
rise
.
<EOS>
as
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
to
Captain
Cuttle
than
make
himself
very
red
and
short
of
breath
in
such
a
cause
,
he
turn
to
(
as
he
himself
say
)
with
a
will
;
and
,
in
a
couple
of
hour
,
this
garret
be
transform
into
a
species
of
land
-
cabin
,
adorn
with
all
the
choice
moveable
out
of
the
parlour
,
inclusive
even
of
the
Tartar
frigate
,
which
the
Captain
hang
up
over
the
chimneypiece
with
such
extreme
delight
,
that
he
could
do
nothing
for
half
-
an
-
hour
afterwards
but
walk
backward
from
it
,
lose
in
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
the
captain
could
be
induce
by
no
persuasion
of
Walter
's
to
wind
up
the
big
watch
,
or
to
take
back
the
canister
,
or
to
touch
the
sugar
-
tong
and
teaspoon
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
my
lad
,
"
be
the
Captain
's
invariable
reply
to
any
solicitation
of
the
kind
,
"
I
have
make
that
there
little
property
over
,
jintly
.
<EOS>
"
these
word
he
repeat
with
great
unction
and
gravity
,
evidently
believe
that
they
have
the
virtue
of
an
Act
of
Parliament
,
and
that
unless
he
commit
himself
by
some
new
admission
of
ownership
,
no
flaw
could
be
find
in
such
a
form
of
conveyance
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
an
advantage
of
the
new
arrangement
,
that
besides
the
great
seclusion
it
afford
Florence
<EOS>
,
it
admit
of
the
Midshipman
be
restore
to
his
usual
post
of
observation
,
and
also
of
the
shop
shutter
be
take
down
.
<EOS>
the
latter
ceremony
,
however
little
importance
the
unconscious
Captain
attach
to
it
,
be
not
wholly
superfluous
;
for
,
on
the
previous
day
,
so
much
excitement
have
be
occasion
in
the
neighbourhood
,
by
the
shutter
remain
unopene
,
that
the
instrument
-
maker
's
house
have
be
honour
with
an
unusual
share
of
public
observation
,
and
have
be
intently
stare
at
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
,
by
group
of
hungry
gazer
,
at
any
time
between
sunrise
and
sunset
.
<EOS>
the
idler
and
vagabond
have
be
particularly
interested
in
the
Captain
's
fate
;
constantly
grovel
in
the
mud
to
apply
their
eye
to
the
cellar
-
grating
,
under
the
shop
-
window
,
and
delight
their
imagination
with
the
fancy
that
they
could
see
a
piece
of
his
coat
as
he
hang
in
a
corner
;
though
this
settlement
of
him
be
stoutly
dispute
by
an
opposite
faction
,
who
be
of
opinion
that
he
lie
murder
with
a
hammer
,
on
the
stair
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
without
excite
some
discontent
,
therefore
,
that
the
subject
of
these
rumour
be
see
early
in
the
morning
stand
at
his
shop
-
door
as
hale
and
hearty
as
if
nothing
have
happen
;
and
the
beadle
of
that
quarter
,
a
man
of
an
ambitious
character
,
who
have
expect
to
have
the
distinction
of
be
present
at
the
breaking
open
of
the
door
,
and
of
give
evidence
in
full
uniform
before
the
corner
,
go
so
far
as
to
say
to
an
opposite
neighbour
,
that
the
chap
in
the
glaze
hat
have
well
not
try
it
on
there
---
without
more
particularly
mention
<EOS>
what

and
further
,
that
he

the
Beadle

would
keep
his

look
down
the

familiar

anxious

Florence
could
not

with
this
information
the

that

the
question

whether

praise
him
in

tell
Florence
what
he
have
say
on
leave
the

with
every
graceful
setting

off

way

appreciation

lose
child
in
the
stare
street
;
but
he
soon
become
constrained
---
her
quick
affection
be
too
watchful
not
to
know
it
---
and
uneasy
,
and
soon
leave
her
.
<EOS>
unsought
,
he
never
come
,
all
day
,
between
the
morning
and
the
night
.
<EOS>
when
the
evening
close
in
,
he
be
always
there
,
and
that
be
her
happy
time
,
<EOS>
for
then
she
half
believe
that
the
old
Walter
of
her
childhood
be
not
change
.
<EOS>
but
,
even
then
,
some
trivial
word
,
look
,
or
circumstance
would
show
her
that
there
be
an
indefinable
division
between
them
which
could
not
be
pass
.
  
<EOS>
and
she
could
not
but
see
that
these
revealing
of
a
great
alteration
in
Walter
manifest
themselves
in
despite
of
his
utmost
effort
to
hide
them
.
<EOS>
in
his
consideration
for
her
,
she
think
,
and
in
the
earnestness
of
his
desire
to
spare
her
any
wound
from
his
kind
hand
,
he
resort
to
innumerable
little
artifice
and
disguise
.
<EOS>
so
much
the
more
do
Florence
feel
the
greatness
of
the
alteration
in
him
;
so
much
the
oftener
<EOS>
do
she
weep
at
this
estrangement
of
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
the
good
captain
---
<EOS>
her
untiring
,
tender
,
ever
zealous
friend
---
see
it
,
too
,
Florence
think
,
and
it
pain
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
less
cheerful
and
hopeful
than
he
have
be
at
first
,
and
would
steal
look
at
her
and
Walter
,
by
turn
,
when
they
be
all
three
together
of
an
evening
,
with
quite
a
sad
face
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
resolve
,
at
last
,
to
speak
to
Walter
.
<EOS>
She
believe
she
know
now
what
the
cause
of
his
estrangement
be
,
and
she
think
it
would
be
a
relief
to
her
full
heart
,
and
would
set
him
more
at
ease
,
if
she
tell
him
she
have
find
it
out
,
and
quite
submit
to
it
,
and
do
not
reproach
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
on
a
certain
Sunday
afternoon
,
that
Florence
take
this
resolution
.
<EOS>
the
faithful
captain
,
in
an
amazing
shirt
-
collar
,
be
sit
by
her
,
read
with
his
spectacle
on
,
and
she
ask
him
where
Walter
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
be
down
below
,
my
lady
lass
,
"
return
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
speak
to
him
,
"
say
Florence
,
rise
hurriedly
as
if
to
go
down
stair
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
rouse
him
up
here
,
Beauty
,
"
say
the
Captain
,
"
in
a
trice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
thereupon
the
Captain
,
with
much
alacrity
,
shoulder
his
book
---
<EOS>
for
he
make
it
a
point
of
duty
to
read
none
but
very
large
book
on
a
Sunday
,
as
have
a
more
staid
appearance
:
and
have
bargain
,
year
ago
,
for
a
prodigious
volume
at
a
book
-
stall
,
five
line
of
which
utterly
confound
him
at
any
time
,
insomuch
that
he
have
not
yet
ascertain
of
what
subject
it
treat
---
and
withdraw
.
<EOS>
Walter
soon
appear
.
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Cuttle

me
,
Miss
Dombey

"
he
eagerly
begin
on
come
in

but
stop
when
he
see
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
You

not
so
well
to

day
.
<EOS>
You
look
distressed
.
<EOS>
You
have
be

"
  
<EOS>
He
speak
so
kindly
,
and
with
such
a
fervent
tremor
in
his
voice
,
that
the
tear
gush
into
her
eye
at
the
sound
of
his
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
Walter
,
"
say
Florence
,
gently
,
"
I
be
not
quite
well
,
and
I
have
be

<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
sit
down
opposite
to
her
,
look
at
her
beautiful
and
innocent
face
:
and
his
own
turned
pale
,
and
his
lip
tremble
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
say
,
upon
the
night
when
I
know
that
you
be
save

<EOS>
and
<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
dear
Walter
,
what
I
feel
that
night
,
and
what
I
hope
!
"
<EOS>
---
   
<EOS>
He
put
his
tremble
hand
upon
the
table
between
them
,
and
sit
look
at
her
.
   
<EOS>
---
"
that
I
be
change
.
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
to
hear
you
say
so
,
but
I
understand
,
now
,
that
I
be
.
<EOS>
do
not
be
angry
with
me
,
Walter
.
<EOS>
I
be
too
much
overjoyed
to
think
of
it
,
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
seem
a
child
to
him
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
ingenuous
,
confide
,
love
child
he
see
and
hear
.
<EOS>
not
the
dear
woman
,
at
whose
foot
he
would
have
lay
the
rich
of
the
earth
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
remember
the
last
time
I
see
you
,
Walter
,
before
you
go
away
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
his
hand
into
his
breast
,
and
take
out
a
little
purse
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
wear
it
round
my
neck
!
<EOS>
if
I
have
go
down
in
the
deep
,
it
would
have
be
with
me
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
will
wear
it
still
,
Walter
,
for
my
old
sake
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
until
I
die
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
lay
her
hand
on
his
,
as
fearlessly
and
simply
,
as
if
not
a
day
have
intervene
since
she
give
him
the
little
token
of
remembrance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
always
glad
to
think
so
,
Walter
.
<EOS>
do
you
recollect
that
a
thought
of
this
change
seem
to
come
into
our
mind
at
the
same
time
that
evening
,
when
we
be
talk
together
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
!
"
<EOS>
he
answer
,
in
a
wonder
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Walter
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
the
mean
of
injure
your
hope
and
prospect
even
then
.
<EOS>
I
fear
to
think
so
,
then
,
but
I
know
it
now
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
able
,
then
,
in
your
generosity
,
to
hide
from
me
that
you
know
it
too
,
you
can
not
do
so
now
,
although
you
try
as
generously
as
before
.
<EOS>
You
do
.
<EOS>
I
thank
you
for
it
,
Walter
,
deeply
,
truly
;
but
you
can
not
succeed
.
<EOS>
You
have
suffer
too
much
in
your
own
hardship
,
and
in
those
of
your
dear
relation
,
quite
to
overlook
the
innocent
cause
of
all
the
peril
and
affliction
that
have
befall
you
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
quite
forget
me
in
that
character
,
and
we
can
be
brother
and
sister
no
longer
.
<EOS>
but
,
dear
Walter
,
do
not
think
that
I
complain
of
you
in
this
.
<EOS>
I
may
have
know
it
---
ought
to
have
know
it
---
but
forget
it
in
my
joy
.
<EOS>
all
I
hope
be
that
you
may
think
of
me
less
irksomely
when
this
feeling
be
no
more
a
secret
one
;
and
all
I
ask
be
,
Walter
,
in
the
name
of
the
poor
child
who
be
your
sister
once
,
that
you
will
not
struggle
with
yourself
,
and
pain
yourself
,
for
my
sake
,
now
that
I
know
all
!

<EOS>
Walter
have
look
upon
her
while
she
say
this
,
with
a
face
so
full
of
wonder
and
amazement
,
that
it
have
room
for
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
now
he
catch
up
the
hand
that
touch
his
,
so
entreatingly
,
and
hold
it
between
his
own

"
oh

he
say
,
"
be
it
possible
that
while
I

there

haunt
him
so

that
feel
such
sorrow

solicitude

They
be

of
opinion
that

<EOS>
nothing

all
such
excitement

a

<EOS>
recent
occurrence
to
which
he
need
not

particularly
allude

which
have
not

altogether
without
notice
in
some
Sunday
Papers

and
in
a

he
nee
not

(
here
every
other
member

an
audible
murmur

,
have
cause
him
to
reflect
;
and
he
feel
that
for
him
and
Robinson
to
have
any
personal
difference
at
such
a
moment
,
would
be
for
ever
to
deny
that
good
feeling
in
the
general
cause
,
for
which
he
have
reason
to
think
and
hope
that
the
gentleman
in
Dombey

House
have
always

<EOS>
Robinson
reply
to
this
like
a
man

one
gentleman

of
lapse

suddenly
burst
out
with
a
thrilling
speech

in

May

soda

dreadfully

<EOS>
It
appear

he
meet
everybody
concerned
in
the
late

everywhere

say
to
them

away

either
the
consciousness
of
these
enormity

the
reaction
consequent

liquor

reduce
Mr
Perch
to
an
extreme
state
of
low
spirit
at
that
hour
of
the
evening
when
he
usually
seek
consolation
in
the
society
of
Mrs
Perch
at
Balls
Pond

and
Mrs

fret
a
good
deal

for
she
fear
his

that
he

Mr

Mr

maudlin
after

corner
house

<EOS>
They
whisper
about

wonder
where

agree
that

Her
sharp
eye

detect
an
involuntary
expression

this
feeling
on

which
be
not

under
the
circumstance

<EOS>
in
satisfaction

in

have
some
quarrel

soon
his
tread
grow
slow

heavy

more
sternly
thoughtful

fix
itself
in

More
intelligence
 
<EOS>
there
be
two
of
the
traitor
's
own
blood
---
his
renounced
brother
and
sister
---
on
whom
the
weight
of
his
guilt
rest
almost
more
heavily
,
at
this
time
,
than
on
the
man
whom
he
have
so
deeply
injure
.
<EOS>
pry
and
torment
as
the
world
be
,
it
do
Mr
Dombey
the
service
of
nerve
him
to
pursuit
and
revenge
.
<EOS>
It
rouse
his
passion
,
stung
his
pride
,
twist
the
one
idea
of
his
life
into
a
new
shape
,
and
make
some
gratification
of
his
wrath
,
the
object
into
which
his
whole
intellectual
existence
resolve
itself
.
<EOS>
all
the
stubbornness
and
implacability
of
his
nature
,
all
its
hard
impenetrable
quality
,
all
its
gloom
and
moroseness
,
all
its
exaggerated
sense
of
personal
importance
,
all
its
jealous
disposition
to
resent
the
least
flaw
in
the
ample
recognition
of
his
importance
by
other
,
set
this
way
like
many
stream
unite
into
one
,
and
bear
him
on
upon
their
tide
.
<EOS>
the
most
impetuously
passionate
and
violently
impulsive
of
mankind
would
have
be
a
milder
enemy
to
encounter
than
the
sullen
Mr
Dombey
work
to
this
.
<EOS>
a
wild
beast
would
have
be
easy
turn
or
soothe
than
the
grave
gentleman
without
a
wrinkle
in
his
starched
cravat
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
very
intensity
of
his
purpose
become
almost
a
substitute
for
action
in
it
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
yet
uninforme
of
the
traitor
's
retreat
,
it
serve
to
divert
his
mind
from
his
own
calamity
,
and
to
entertain
it
with
another
prospect
.
<EOS>
the
brother
and
sister
of
his
false
favourite
have
no
such
relief
;
everything
in
their
history
,
past
and
present
,
give
his
delinquency
a
more
afflicting
meaning
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
sister
may
have
sometimes
sadly
think
that
if
she
have
remain
with
him
,
the
companion
and
friend
she
have
be
once
,
he
may
have
escape
the
crime
into
which
he
have
fall
.
<EOS>
if
she
ever
think
so
,
it
be
still
without
regret
for
what
she
have
do
,
without
the
least
doubt
of
her
duty
,
without
any
pricing
and
enhancing
of
her
self
-
devotion
.
<EOS>
but
when
this
possibility
present
itself
to
the
erring
and
repentant
brother
,
as
it
sometimes
do
,
it
smote
upon
his
heart
with
such
a
keen
,
reproachful
touch
as
he
could
hardly
bear
.
<EOS>
no
idea
of
retort
upon
his
cruel
brother
come
into
his
mind
.
<EOS>
new
accusation
of
himself
,
fresh
inward
lamenting
over
his
own
unworthiness
,
and
the
ruin
in
which
it
be
at
once
his
consolation
and
his
self
-
reproach
that
he
do
not
stand
alone
,
be
the
sole
kind
of
reflection
to
which
the
discovery
give
rise
in
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
on
the
very
same
day
whose
evening
set
upon
the
last
chapter
,
and
when
Mr
Dombey
's
world
be
busy
with
the
elopement
of
his
wife
,
that
the
window
of
the
room
in
which
the
brother
and

sit
at
their
early
breakfast
,
be
darken
by
the
unexpected

of
a

"
I

what

good

with
a
shake

manner

could
not

almost
the
effect

"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Perch
's
appearance
corroborate
this
recital
of
his
symptom
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
air
of
feverish
lassitude
about
it
,
that
seem
referable
to
dram
;
and
,
which
,
in
fact
,
may
no

have
be
trace
to
those
numerous

therefore
I
can
judge

Mr

shake
his

again

silvery

of
the

Mr

go
past

towards
London

never
pause

wave
his

cheerfully

He
make
that
promise

propose
these
curious
interview

keep
it
so
faithfully

pleasantly

last
Monday

do
not
go
by

I

only
speculate
on
the
coincidence

sure

will
return

me
tell
him

bring
you
together

He
will
certainly
help
us
to
a
new
livelihood

<EOS>
His
entreaty
be
that
he
may
do
something
to
smooth
my
life

yours

I
give
him
my
promise
that
if

His

put
his

be
interesting
to
him
to
see
them
together

go
on
to
say
,
with
a
king
of
irritable
thoughtfulness

It

You
shall
judge
of
its

for
more
year

go
on

can
tell

have
be
one
,
perhaps
,
originally
;

be
separate

as
Mr

say
,
"
say
her
brother

look
back
to
him
for
the
resumption

his
explanation

I

whistle

It
happen
seldom

I

anything

private
nature

certainly
.

when
I
be
,
and
could
not

avoid
know
something
of
it

I
walk
out

I
walk
out
once

conversation
between
two
brother

to
which
,
in
the
beginning
,
young
Walter
Gay
be
a
party

I
overhear
some
of
it
before
I
leave
the
room

<EOS>
You
remember
it
sufficiently
,
perhaps
,
to
tell
your
sister
what
its
nature
be
?

<EOS>
"
It
refer
,
Harriet
,
"
say
her
brother
in
a
low
voice

"
to
the
past

to
our
relative
position
in
the
House

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Its
matter
be
not
new
to
me
,
but
be
present
in
a
new
aspect
.
<EOS>
It
shake
me
in
my
habit
---
the
habit
of
nine
-
tenth
of
the
world
---
of
believe
that
all
be
right
about
me
,
because
I
be
use
to
it
,
"
say
their
visitor
;
"
and
induce
me
to
recall
the
history
of
the
two
brother
,
and
to
ponder
on
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
almost
the
first
time
in
my
life
when
I
fall
into
this
train
of
reflection
<EOS>
---
how
will
many
thing
that
be
familiar
,
and
quite
matter
of
course
to
us
now
,
look
when
we
come
to
see
them
from
that
new
and
distant
point
of
view
which
we
must
all
take
up
,
one
day
or
other
?
<EOS>
I
be
something
less
goodnatured
,
as
the
phrase
go
,
after
that
morning
,
less
easy
and
complacent
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
sit
for
a
minute
or
so
,
drum
with
one
hand
on
the
table
;
and
resume
in
a
hurry
,
as
if
he
be
anxious
to
get
rid
of
his
confession
.
  
<EOS>
"
before
I
know
what
to
do
,
or
whether
I
could
do
anything
,
there
be
a
second
conversation
between
the
same
two
brother
,
in
which
their
sister
be
mention
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
scruple
of
conscience
in
suffer
all
the
waifs
and
stray
of
that
conversation
to
float
to
me
as
freely
as
they
would
.
<EOS>
I
consider
them
mine
by
right
.
<EOS>
after
that
,
I
come
here
to
see
the
sister
for
myself
.
<EOS>
the
first
time
I
stop
at
the
garden
gate
,
I
make
a
pretext
of
inquire
into
the
character
of
a
poor
neighbour
;
but
I
wander
out
of
that
tract
,
and
<EOS>
I
think
Miss
Harriet
mistrust
me
.
<EOS>
the
second
time
I
ask
leave
to
come
in
;
come
in
;
and
say
what
I
wish
to
say
.
<EOS>
Your
sister
show
me
reason
which
I
dare
not
dispute
,
for
receive
no
assistance
from
me
then
;
but
I
establish
a
means
of
communication
between
us
,
which
remain
unbroken
until
within
these
few
day
,
when
I
be
prevent
,
by
important
matter
that
have
lately
devolve
upon
me
,
from
maintain
them
.

"
  
<EOS>

how
little
I
have
suspect
this
,
"
say
John
Carker
,
"
when
I
have
see
you
every
day
,
Sir
!
<EOS>
if
Harriet
could
have
guess
your
name
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
John
,
"
interpose
the
visitor
,
"
I
keep
it
to
myself
for
two
reason
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
the
first
may
have
be
bind
alone
;
but
one
have
no
business
to
take
credit
for
good
intention
,
and
I
make
up
my
mind
,
at
all
event
,
not
to
disclose
myself
until
I
should
be
able
to
do
you
some
real
service
or
other
.
<EOS>
My
second
reason
be
,
that
I
always
hope
there
may
be
some
linger
possibility
of
your
brother
's
relent
towards
you
both
;
and
in
that
case
,
I
feel
that
where
there
be
the
chance
of
a
man
of
his
suspicious
,
watchful
character
,
discover
that
you
have
be
secretly
befriend
by
me
,
there
be
the
chance
of
a
new
and
fatal
cause
of
division
.
<EOS>
I
resolve
,
to
be
sure
,
at
the
risk
of
turn
his
displeasure
against
myself
---
which
would
have
be
no
matter
---
to
watch
my
opportunity
of
serve
you
with
the
head
of
the
House
;
but
the
distraction
of
death
,
courtship
,
marriage
,
and
domestic
unhappiness
,
have
leave
us
no
head
but
your
brother
for
this
long
,
long
time
.
<EOS>
and
it
would
have
be
well
for
us
,
"
say
the
visitor
,
drop
his
voice
,
"
to
have
be
a
lifeless
trunk
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
seem
conscious
that
these
latter
word
have
escape
him
against
his
will
,
and
stretch
out
a
hand
to
the
brother
,
and
a
hand
to
the
sister
,
continue
:
  
"
all
I
could
desire
to
say
,
and
more
,
I
have
now
say
.
<EOS>
all
I
mean
go
beyond
word
,
as
I
hope
you
understand
and
believe
.
<EOS>
the
time
have
come
,
John
---
though
most
unfortunately
and
unhappily
come
---
when
I
may
help
you
without
interfere
with
that
redeem
struggle
,
which
have
last
through
so
many
year
;
since
you
be
discharge
from
it
to
-
day
by
no
act
of
your
own
.
<EOS>
It
be
late
;
I
need
say
no
more
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
You
will
guard
the
treasure
you
have
here
,
without
advice
or
reminder
from
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
these
word
he
rise
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
go
you
first
,
John
,
"
he
say
good
-
humouredly
,
"
with
a
light
,
without
say
what
you
want
to
say
,
whatever
that
may
be
;
"
John
Carker
's
heart
be
full
,
and
he
would
have
relieve
it
in
speech
,
if
he
could
;
"
and
let
me
have
a
word
with
your
sister
.
<EOS>
We
have
talk
alone
before
,
and
in
this
room
too
;
though
it
look
more
natural
with
you
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
follow
him
out
with
his
eye
,
he
turn
kindly
to
Harriet
,
and
say
in
a
low
voice
,
and
with
an
altered
and
graver
manner
:
  
"
You
wish
to
ask
me
something
of
the
man
whose
sister
it
be
your
misfortune
to
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dread
to
ask
,
"
say
Harriet
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
look
so
earnestly
at
me
more
than
once
,
"
rejoin
the
visitor
,
"
<EOS>
that
I
think
I
can
divine
your
question
.
<EOS>
have
he
take
money
?
<EOS>
be
it
that
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
Heaven
!
"
say
Harriet
.
<EOS>
"
for
the
sake
of
John
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
he
have
abuse
his
trust
in
many
way
,
"
say
Mr
Morfin
;
"
that
he
have
oftener
deal
and
speculate
to
advantage
for
himself
,
than
for
the
House
he
represent
;
that
he
have
lead
the
House
on
,
to
prodigious
venture
,
often
result
in
enormous
loss
;
that
he
have
always
pamper
the
vanity
and
ambition
of
his
employer
,
when
it
be
his
duty
to
have
hold
them
in
check
,
and
show
,
as
it
be
in
his
power
to
do
,
to
what
they
tend
here
or
other
;
will
not
,
perhaps
,
surprise
you
now
.
<EOS>
undertaking
have
be
enter
on
,
to
swell
the
reputation
of
the
house
for
vast
resource
,
and
to
exhibit
it
in
magnificent
contrast
to
other
merchant
'
house
,
of
which
it
require
a
steady
head
to
contemplate
the
possibly
---
a
few
disastrous
change
of
affair
may
render
them
the
probably

ruinous
consequence
.
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
the
many
transaction
of
the
House
,
in
most
part
of
the
world
:
a
great
labyrinth
of
which
only
he
have
hold
the
clue
:
he
have
have
the
opportunity
,
and
he
seem
to
have
use
it
,
of
keep
the
various
result
afloat
,
when
ascertain
,
and
substituting
estimate
and
generality
for
fact

<EOS>
but
latterly
---

me
,
Miss
Harriet

<EOS>
"
perfectly
,
perfectly

frightened
face

on
his

<EOS>
pray
tell
me
all
the
bad
at
once

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
latterly
,
he
appear
to
have
devote
the
great
pain
to
make
these
result
so
plain
and
clear
,
that
reference
to
the
private
book
enable
one
to
grasp
them
,
numerous
and
varying
as
they
be
,
with
extraordinary
ease

<EOS>
as
if
he
have
resolve
to
show
his
employer
at
one
broad
view
what
have
be
bring
upon
him
by
ministration
to
his
ruling
passion!that
it
have
be
his
constant
practice
to
minister
to
that
passion
basely
,

flatter
it
corruptly

indubitable

Harriet

no
danger
in
all
this

with
a
little
hesitation

"
to
the
credit
of
the
House

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not

you
plainly

you
completely

Mr

after
a
moment

survey

no

<EOS>
there
may
be
difficulty

great

less
difficulty

no
danger

unless

indeed

the
head
of
the
House

unable

bring
his
mind

the
reduction
of
its
enterprise
,
and
positively
refuse
to
believe

in
any
position

the
position
in
which
he
have
always

urge
it
beyond
its
strength

then
it

there

You

<EOS>
with
that

kiss
her
hand

pass
out
to
the
door

brother
stand
await
his
come

put
him
cheerfully
aside

often

may
speak
at
another
time

there

it

<EOS>
the
brother

converse
by
the
fireside
,
until
it
be
almost
day
;
make
sleepless
by
this
glimpse
of
the
new
world
that
open
before

feel
like
two
people
shipwreck
long
ago
,
upon
a
solitary
coast
,
to
whom
a
ship
have
come
at
last
,
when
they
be
old
in
resignation

have
lose
all
thought

different
kind
of
disquietude

dark

John

go
out
,
in
pursuance
of
a
letter
of
appointment
from
their

alone

She

,
grave

the
idea
of
this

about
her
in
frightful
shape

<EOS>
He
be
dead
,
die
,
call
to
her
,
stare
at
her
,
frown
on
her

<EOS>
the
picture
in
her
mind
be
so
obtrusive
and
exact
that
,
as
the
twilight
deepen
,
she
dread
to
raise
her
head
and
look
at
the
dark
corner
of
the
room
,
lest
his
wraith
,
the
offspring
of
her
excited
imagination
,
should
be
wait
there
,
to
startle
her
.
<EOS>
once
she
have
such
a
fancy
of
his
being
in
the
next
room
,
hiding
---
though
she
know
quite
well
what
a
distemper
fancy
<EOS>
it
be
,
and
have
no
belief
in
it

that
she

herself
to
go
there

for
her
own
conviction

<EOS>
but
in
vain

<EOS>
the
room
resume
its
shadowy
terror

the
moment
she
leave
it
;
and
she
have
no
more
power
to
divest
herself
of
these
vague
impression
of
dread
,
than
if
they
have
be
stone
giant
,
root
in
the
solid
earth

<EOS>
It
be
almost
dark
,
and

near
the
window

with
her
head
upon
her

look
down
,
when
,
sensible
of
a
sudden
increase
in
the
gloom
of
the
apartment

she
raise
her
eye
,
and
utter
an
involuntary
cry

<EOS>
close
to
the
glass
,
a
pale
scared
face
gaze
in

vacantly

for
an

imploringly
,
a
certain
dread
and
terror
in
the
voice
akin

the
moment

with
Harriet

She
hasten
to

seem
to
come

and
stifle
into
that

distant
one

the
cathedral
clock

in
Edith

ear

<EOS>
She
hear
him
pause

<EOS>
Her

You

repeat
hundred

thus

force
by

I
have

force
by
the
two

yield
up
the

He
see

desperate

His

follow

see
a
change
in

,
in

go
through

once
turn
,
once
change

inflexible
unyielding
look

terror

occasion

this
night

alarm

have
subdue
her
;
not

less
readily

overwrought
condition

throw
open

door

he
follow

almost
instantly

the
room
be
dark
;
and
as
she
make
no
answer
to
his
call
,
he
be
fain
to
go
back
for
the
lamp
.
<EOS>
He
hold
it
up
,
and
look
round
everywhere
,
expect
to
see
her
crouching
in
some
corner
;
but
the
room
be
empty
.
<EOS>
so
,
into
the
drawing
-
room
and
dining
-
room
he
go
,
in
succession
,
with
the
uncertain
step
of
a
man
in
a
strange
place
;
look
fearfully
about
,
and
pry
behind
screen
and
couch
;
but
she
be
not
there
.
<EOS>
no
,
nor
in
the
hall
,
which
be
so
bare
that
he
could
see
that
,
at
a
glance
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
time
,
the
ringing
at
the
bell
be
constantly
renew
;
and
those
without
be
beat
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
put
his
lamp
down
at
a
distance
,
and
go
near
it
,
listen
.
<EOS>
there
be
several
voice
talk
together
:
at
least
two
of
them
in
English
;
and
though
the
door
be
thick
,
and
there
be
great
confusion
,
he
know
one
of
these
too
well
to
doubt
whose
voice
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
He
take
up
his
lamp
again
,
and
come
back
quickly
through
all
the
room
,
stop
as
he
quit
each
,
and
look
round
for
her
,
with
the
light
raise
above
his
head

He
be
stand
thus
in

lead
to
the
little
passage
in

wall

catch
his
eye

He
go
to
it

fasten
on

other
side

she
have
drop
a
veil
in
go
through

shut
it
in
the
door

<EOS>
all
this
time
the
people
on
the
stair
be
ring
at
the
bell
,
and
knock
with
their
hand
and
foot
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
coward
:
but
these
sound
;
what
have
go
before
;
the
strangeness
of
the
place
,
which
have
confuse
him
,
even
in
his
return
from
the
hall
;
the
frustration
of
his
scheme
(
for
,
strange
to
say
,
he
would
have
be
much
bold
,
if
they
have
succeed
)
;
the
unseasonable
time
;
the
recollection
of
have
no
one
near
to
whom
he
could
appeal
for
any
friendly
office
;
above
all
,
the
sudden
sense
,
which
make
even
his
heart
beat
like
lead
,
that
the
man
whose
confidence
he
have
outrage
,
and
whom
he
have
so
treacherously
deceive
,
be
there
to
recognise
and
challenge
him
with
his
mask
pluck
off
his
face
;
strike
a
panic
through
him
.
<EOS>
He
try
the
door
in
which
the
veil
be
shut
,
but
could
not
force
it
.
<EOS>
He
open
one
of
the
window
,
and
look
down
through
the
lattice
of
the
blind
,
into
the
court
-
yard
;
but
it
be
a
high
leap
,
and
the
stone
be
pitiless
.
  
<EOS>
the
ringing
and
knock
still
continue
---
his
panic
too
---
he
go
back
to
the
door
in
the
bed
-
chamber
,
and
with
some
new
effort
,
each
more
stubborn
than
the
last
,
wrench
it
open
.
<EOS>
see
the
little
staircase
not
far
off
,
and
feel
the
night
-
air
come
up
,
he
steal
back
for
his
hat
and
coat
,
make
the
door
as
secure
after
him
as
he
could
,
creep
down
lamp
in
hand
,
extinguish
it
on
see
the
street
,
and
have
put
it
in
a
corner
,
go
out
where
the
star
be
shine

so
near
a

he
would
have
brave
out
this
,
after
the
first
momentary
shock
of
alarm
,
and
would
have
put
as
bold
a
front
upon
his
guilt
as
any
villain
.
<EOS>
but
the
springing
of
his
mine
upon
himself
,
seem
to
have
rent
and
shiver
all
his
hardihood
and
self

reliance
.
<EOS>
spurn
like
any
reptile
;
entrap
and
mock
;
turn
upon
,
and
tread
down
by
the
proud
woman
whose
mind
he
have
slowly
poison
,
as
he
think
,
until
she
have
sink
into
the
mere
creature
of
his
pleasure

undeceived
in
his
deceit

and
with
his
fox

strip
off

he
sneak
away
,
abash
,

,
and
afraid

<EOS>
some
other
terror

upon
him
quite

from
this
of

pursue
,
suddenly
,
like
an
electric
shock
,
as
he
be
creep
through
the
street
.
<EOS>
some
visionary
terror
,
unintelligible
and
inexplicable
,
associate
with
a
trembling
of
the
ground
,
---
a
rush
and
sweep
of
something
through
the
air
,
like
death
upon
the
wing
.
<EOS>
He
shrink
,
as
if
to
let
the
thing
go
by
.
<EOS>
It
be
not

it
never
have

there
,
yet
what
a
startling
horror
it
have
leave
behind

<EOS>
He
raise
his
wicked
face
,
so
full
of
trouble
,
to
the
night
sky
,
where
the
star
,
so
full
of
peace
,
be
shine
on
him
as
they
have
be
when
he
first
steal
out
into
the
air
;
and
stop
to
think
what
he
should
do
.
<EOS>
the
dread
of
be
hunt
in
a
strange
remote
place
,
where
the
law
may
not
protect
him
---
the
novelty
of
the
feeling
that
it
be
strange
and
remote
,
originate
in
his
be
leave
alone
so
suddenly
amid
the
ruin
of
his
plan
---
his
great
dread
of
seek
refuge
now
,
in
Italy
or
in
Sicily
,
where
man
may
be
hire
to
assassinate
him
,
he
think
,
at
any
dark
street
corner
---
the
waywardness
of
guilt
and
fear
---
perhaps
some
sympathy
of
action
with
the
turning
back
of
all
his
scheme
---
impel
him
to
turn
back
too
,
and
go
to
England
.

He

clench
his

.
<EOS>
as
he
creep
along
,
in
the
shadow
of
the
massive
building

he
set
his

mutter
dreadful
imprecation
on

look
from

he
steal
on
to
the
gate
of

yard

in

him
when

he
steal
away
again
,
beyond
the
town
,
past
the
old
rampart
,
out
on
the
open
road
,
which
seem
to
glide
away
along
the
dark
plain

like

Whither

what

<EOS>
as
he
pause

with
some
such
suggestion
within
him

look
over
the
gloomy
flat
where
the
slender

mark
out

again
that
flight
of
Death

rush
up

again
go
on

impetuous
and
resistless
,
again
be
nothing

a
horror
in
his

,
dark
as
the
scene

undefined
as
its
remote

<EOS>
there
be
no

the

shadow
of
familiar

in

strange

of

repetition

away

the
smoking

away

again
the

up

the

all

into

<EOS>
the
light

dance
upon

like
imp

<EOS>
no
stop
now
<EOS>
:
no
slackening
!
<EOS>
on
,
on
!
<EOS>
away
with
him
upon
the
dark
road
wildly
!
  
<EOS>
He
could
not
think
to
any
purpose
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
separate
one
subject
of
reflection
from
another
,
sufficiently
to
dwell
upon
it
,
by
itself
,
for
a
minute
at
a
time
.
<EOS>
the
crash
of
his
project
for
the
gaining
of
a
voluptuous
compensation
for
past
restraint
;
the
overthrow
of
his
treachery
to
one
who
have
be
true
and
generous
to
him
,
but
whose
least
proud
word
and
look
he
have
treasure
up
,
at
interest
,
for
year
---
for
false
and
subtle
man
will
always
secretly
despise
and
dislike
the
object
upon
which
they
fawn
,
and
always
resent
the
payment
and
receipt
of
homage
that
they
know
to
be
worthless
;
these
be
the
theme
uppermost
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
a
lurk
rage
against
the
woman
who
have
so
entrap
him
and
avenge
herself
be
always
there
;
crude
and
misshapen
scheme
of
retaliation
upon
her
,
float
in
his
brain
;
but
nothing
be
distinct
.
<EOS>
a
hurry
and
contradiction
pervade
all
his
thought
.
<EOS>
even
while
he
be
so
busy
with
this
fevered
,
ineffectual
thinking
,
his
one
constant
idea
be
,
that
he
would
postpone
reflection
until
some
indefinite
time
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
the
old
day
before
the
second
marriage
rise
up
in
his
remembrance
.
<EOS>
He
think
how
jealous
he
have
be
of
the
boy
,
how
jealous
he
have
be
of
the
girl
,
how
artfully
he
have
keep
intruder
at
a
distance
,
and
draw
a
circle
round
his
dupe
that
none
but
himself
should
cross
;
and
then
he
think
,
have
he
do
all
this
to
be
fly
now
,
like
a
scared
thief
,
from
only
the
poor
dupe
?
  
<EOS>
He
could
have
lay
hand
upon
himself
for
his
cowardice
,
but
it
be
the
very
shadow
of
his
defeat
,
and
could
not
be
separate
from
it
.
<EOS>
to
have
his
confidence
in
his
own
knavery
so
shatter
at
a
blow
---
to
be
within
his
own
knowledge
such
a
miserable
tool
---
be
like
be
paralysed
.
<EOS>
with
an
impotent
ferocity
he
rage
at
Edith
,
and
hate
Mr
Dombey
and
hate
himself
,
but
still
he
flee
,
and
could
do
nothing
else
.
  
<EOS>
again
and
again
he
listen
for
the
sound
of
wheel
behind
.
<EOS>
again
and
again
his
fancy
hear
it
,
come
on
louder
and
louder
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
be
so
persuaded
of
this
,
that
he
cry
out
,
"
stop
!
"
<EOS>
prefer
even
the
loss
of
ground
to
such
uncertainty
.
  
<EOS>
the
word
soon
bring
carriage
,
horse
,
driver

all
in
a
heap
together
,
across
the
road

<EOS>
"

the

over
his

"
  
<EOS>
the
entangled
equipage
,
half
hide
in
the
reek
cloud
from
the
horse
,
go
on
slowly
at
first
,
for
the
driver
,
check
unnecessarily
in
his
progress
,
sulkily
take
out
a
pocket
-
knife
,
and
put
a
new
lash
to
his

.
<EOS>
then
"
Hallo

<EOS>
hallo

hi

"
<EOS>
away
once
more
,
savagely
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
the
star
fade
,
and
<EOS>
the
day
glimmer
,
and
stand
in
the
carriage
,
look
back
,
he
could
discern
the
track
by
which
he
have
come
,
and
see
that
there
be
no
traveller
within
view
,
on
all
the
heavy
expanse
.
<EOS>
and
soon
it
be
broad
day
,
and
the
sun
begin
to
shine
on
cornfield
and
vineyard
;
and
solitary
labourer
,
rise
from
little
temporary
hut
by
heap
of
stone
upon
the
road

here
and
there
,
at

the
highway
,
or
eat
bread
.
<EOS>
by

by

there
be
peasant
go
to
their
daily
labour
,
or
to
market
,
or
lounge
at
the
door
of
poor
cottage
,
gaze
idly
at
him
as
he
pass
.
<EOS>
an
then
there
be
a
postyard
,
ankle
-
deep
in
mud
,
with
steam
dunghill
and
vast
outhouse
half
ruin
;
and
look
on
this
dainty
prospect
,
an
immense
,
old
shadeless
,
glaring
,
stone
chateau
,
with
half
its
window
blind
,
and
green
damp
crawl
lazily
over
it
,
from
the
balustrade
terrace
to
the
taper
tip
of
the
extinguisher
upon
the
turret
.
  
<EOS>
gather
up
moodily
in
a
corner
of
the
carriage
,
and
only
intent
on
go
fast
---
except
when
he
stand
up
,
for
a
mile
together
,
and
look
back
;
which
he
would
do
whenever
there
be
a
piece
of
open
country
---
he
go
on
,
still
postpone
think
indefinitely
,
and
still
always
torment
with
think
to
no
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
shame
,
disappointment
,
and
discomfiture
gnaw
at
his
heart
;
a
constant
apprehension
of
be
overtaken
,
or
meet
---
for
he
be
groundlessly
afraid
even
of
traveller
,
who
come
towards
him
by
the
way
he
be
go
---
oppress
him
heavily
.
<EOS>
the
same
intolerable
awe
and
dread
that
have
come
upon
his
in
the
night
,
return
unweakened
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
the
monotonous
ringing
of
the
bell
and
tramping
of
the
horse
;
the
monotony
of
his
anxiety
,
and
useless
rage
;
the
monotonous
wheel
of
fear
,
regret
,
and
passion
,
he
keep
turn
round
and
round
;
make
the
journey
like
a
vision

<EOS>
I
should
have
have
the
pleasure

of
return

Susan

early
period

,
in
the
first
place
,
we
do
not
know
the
name
of
the
relation
to
whose
house
she
have
go

,
in
the
second
,
as
she
have
leave
that
relation
's
and
go
to
another
at
a
distance
,
I
think
that
scarcely
anything
short
of
the
sagacity
of
the
Chicken
,
would
have
find
her
out
in
the
time

<EOS>
Florence
be
sure

<EOS>

this

be
not
the
point

<EOS>
the
company
of
Susan
have
be
,
I
assure
you
,
Miss

a
consolation

satisfaction

more

conceive

the

<EOS>
Miss

,
I
have
before
observe

I
know
I

not
what
be
consider
a
quick
person

<EOS>
I
be
perfectly
aware

that
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
anybody
could
be
better
acquaint
with
his
own
---
if
it
be
not
too
strong
an
expression
,
I
should
say
with
the
thickness
of
his

than
myself
.
<EOS>
but
,
Miss
Dombey
,
I
do
,
notwithstanding
,
perceive
the
state
of
---
of
thing
---
with
Lieutenant
Walters
.
<EOS>
whatever
agony
that
state
of
thing
may
have
cause
me
(
which
be
of
no

I
be
bind
to
say
,
that
Lieutenant
Walters
be
a
person
who
appear
to
be
worthy
of
the
blessing
that
have
fall
on
his
---
on
his
brow

<EOS>
May
he
wear
it
long
,
and
appreciate
it
,
as
a
very
different

unpleasant

I

ask
you

the
Nipper

though
susceptible
of
womanly

be
almost

from

she

She

Mr

privately

Susan

work
away
at

all

with
the
concentrated

<EOS>
the
wonderful

He

gaze
at
these
box

divide
between
extreme
admiration
of
them
,
and
deject
misgiving
that
they
be
not
gorgeous
enough
,
and
frequently
dive
out
into
the
street
to
purchase
some
wild
article
that
he
deem
necessary

their
completeness

<EOS>
but
his

the

create
a

to
fly

out

<EOS>
how

the

once
to
keep
an
appointment
with
a

but
before

indeed
before

and
before

Walter
say
:
  
"

the
lading
of
our
ship
be
nearly
finish

and
probably
on
the
very
day
of
our
marriage
she
will
drop
down
the
river
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
go
away
that
morning
,
and
stay
in
Kent

my

You

say
Florence

that
we
shall
have
no
marriage
party
,
and
that
nobody
will
distinguish
us
by
our
dress
from
other
people
.
<EOS>
as
we
leave
the
same
day
,
will
you
---
will
you
take
me
somewhere
that
morning
,
Walter
---
early
---
before
we
go
to
church
?
"
  
<EOS>
Walter
seem
to
understand
her
,
as
so
true
a
lover
so
truly
loved
should
,
and
confirm
his
ready
promise
with
a
kiss
---
with
more
than
one
perhaps
,
or
two
or
three
,
or
five
or
six
;
and
in
the
grave
,
peaceful
evening
,
Florence
be
very
happy
.
  
<EOS>
then
into
the
quiet
room
come
Susan
Nipper
and
the
candle
:
shortly
afterwards
,
the
tea
,
the
Captain
,
and
the
excursive
Mr
Toots
,
who
,
as
above
mention
,
be
frequently
on
the
move
afterwards
,
and
pass
but
a
restless
evening
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
not
his
habit
:
for
he
generally
get
on
very
well
,
by
dint
of
play
at
cribbage
with
the
Captain
under
the
advice
and
guidance
of
Miss
Nipper
,
and
distract
his
mind
with
the
calculation
incidental
to
the
game
;
which
he
find
to
be
a
very
effectual
mean
of
utterly
confound
himself
.
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
's
visage
on
these
occasion
present
one
of
the
fine
example
of
combination
and
succession
of
expression
ever
observe
.
<EOS>
His
instinctive
delicacy
and
his
chivalrous
feeling
towards
Florence
,
teach
him
that
it
be
not
a
time
for
any
boisterous
jollity
,
or
violent
display
of
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
certain
float
reminiscence
of
Lovely
Peg
,
on
the
other
hand
,
be
constantly
struggle
for
a
vent
,
and
urge
the
Captain
to
commit
himself
by
some
irreparable
demonstration
.
<EOS>
Anon
,
his
admiration
of
Florence
and
Walter
---
well
-
match
,
truly
,
and
full
of
grace
and
interest
in
their
youth
,
and
love
,
and
good
look
,
as
they
sit
apart
---
would
take
such
complete
possession
of
him
,
that
he
would
lay
down
his
card
,
and
beam
upon
them
,
dab
his
head
all
over
with
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
;
until
warn
,
perhaps
,
by
the
sudden
rushing
forth
of
Mr
Toots
,
that
he
have
unconsciously
be
very
instrumental
,
indeed
,
in
make
that
gentleman
miserable
.
<EOS>
this
reflection
would
make
the
Captain
profoundly
melancholy
,
until
the
return
of
Mr
Toots
;
when
he
would
fall
to
his
card
again
,
with
many
side
wink
and
nod
,
and
polite
wave
of
his
hook
at
Miss
Nipper
,
import
that
he
be
not
go
to
do
so
any
more
.
<EOS>
the
state
that
ensue
on
this
,
be
,
perhaps
,
his
good
;
for
then
,
endeavour
to
discharge
all
expression
from
his
face
,
he
would
sit
,
stare
round
the
room
,
with
all
these
expression
convey
into
it
at
once
,
and
each
wrestling
with
the
other
.
<EOS>
delighted
admiration
of
Florence
and
Walter
always
overthrow
the
rest
,
and
remain
victorious
and
undisguised
,
unless
Mr
Toots
make
another
rush
into
the
air
,
and
then
the
Captain
would
sit
,
like
a
remorseful
culprit
,
until
he
come
back
again
,
occasionally
call
upon
himself
,
in
a
low
reproachful
voice
,
to
"
stand
by
!
"
or
growl
some
remonstrance
to
"
Ed'ard

Cuttle

my

on
the
want
of
caution
observable
in

hard
trial

approach
of
the
Sunday
which
be
to
witness
the
last
of
those
asking
in

the

Mr

thus
state
his

Miss

express
her
readiness

do
so

would
be

besought
him
to

Susan
Nipper
could
only

unfortunate
condition
,
and
agree

to
accompany
him
;
which
she
do
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
the
church
Walter
have
choose
for
the
purpose
,
be
a
mouldy
old
church
in
a
yard
,
hem
in
by
a
labyrinth
of
back
street
and
court
,
with
a
little
burying
-
ground
round
it
,
and
itself
bury
in
a
kind
of
vault
,
form
by
the
neighbouring
house
,
and
pave
with
echo
stone
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
dim
,
shabby
pile
,
with
high
old
oaken
pew
,
among
which
about
a
score
of
people
lose
themselves
every
Sunday
;
while
the
clergyman
's
voice
drowsily
resound
through
the
emptiness
,
and
the
organ
rumble
and
roll
as
if
the
church
have
get
the
colic
,
for
want
of
a
congregation
to
keep
the
wind
and
damp
out
.
<EOS>
but
so
far
be
this
city
church
from
languish
for
the
company
of
other
church
,
that
spire
be
cluster
round
it
,
as
the
mast
of
shipping
cluster
on
the
river
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
hard
to
count
them
from
its
steeple
-
top
,
they
be
so
many
.
<EOS>
in
almost
every
yard
and
blind
-
place
near
,
there
be
a
church
.
<EOS>
the
confusion
of
bell
when
Susan
and
Mr
Toots
betook
themselves
towards
it
on
the
Sunday
morning
,
be
deafen
.
<EOS>
there
be
twenty
church
close
together
,
clamour
for
people
to
come
in
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
stray
sheep
in
question
be
pen
by
a
beadle
in
a
commodious
pew
,
and
,
be
early
,
sit
for
some
time
count
the
congregation
,
listen
to
the
disappointed
bell
high
up
in
the
tower
,
or
look
at
a
shabby
little
old
man
in
the
porch
behind
the
screen
,
who
be
ring
the
same
,
like
the
Bull
in
Cock
Robin
,
with
his
foot
in
a
stirrup
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
,
after
a
lengthened
survey
of
the
large
book
on
the
reading
-
desk
,
whisper
Miss
Nipper
that
he
wonder
where
the
bann
be
keep
,
but
that
young
lady
merely
shake
her
head
and
forward
;
repel
for
the
time
all
approach
of
a
temporal
nature
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
,
however
,
appear
unable
to
keep
his
thought
from
the
banns
,
be
evidently
look
out
for
them
during
the
whole
preliminary
portion
of
the
service
.
<EOS>
as
the
time
for
read
them
approach
,
the
poor
young
gentleman
manifest
great
anxiety
and
trepidation
,
which
be
not
diminish
by
the
unexpected
apparition
of
the
Captain
in
the
front
row
of
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
when
the
clerk
hand
up
a
list
to
the
clergyman
,
Mr
Toots
,
be
then
seat
,
hold
on
by
the
seat
of
the
pew
;
but
when
the
name
of
Walter
Gay
and
Florence
Dombey
be
read
aloud
as
be
in
the
third
and
last
stage
of
that
association
,
he
be
so
entirely
conquer
by
his
feeling
as
to
rush
from
the
church
without
his
hat
,
follow
by
the
beadle
and
pew
-
opener
,
and
two
gentleman
of
the
medical
profession
,
who
happen
to
be
present
;
of
whom
the
first
-
name
presently
return
for
that
article
,
inform
Miss
Nipper
in
a
whisper
that
she
be
not
to
make
herself
uneasy
about
the
gentleman
,
as
the
gentleman
say
his
indisposition
be
of
no
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Nipper
,
feel
that
the
eye
of
that
integral
portion
of
Europe
which
lose
itself
weekly
among
the
high
-
back
pew
,
be
upon
her
,
would
have
be
sufficiently
embarrassed
by
this
incident
,
though
it
have
terminate
here
;
the
more
so
,
as
the
Captain
in
the
front
row
of
the
gallery
,
be
in
a
state
of
unmitigated
consciousness
which
could
hardly
fail
to
express
to
the
congregation
that
he
have
some
mysterious
connexion
with
it
.
<EOS>
but
the
extreme
restlessness
of
Mr
Toots
painfully
increase
and
protract
the
delicacy
of
her
situation
.
<EOS>
that
young
gentleman
,
incapable
,
in
his
state
of
mind
,
of
remain
alone
in
the
churchyard
,
a
prey
to
solitary
meditation
,
and
also
desirous
,
no
doubt
,
of
testify
his
respect
for
the
office
he
have
in
some
measure
interrupt
,
suddenly
return
---
not
come
back
to
the
pew
,
but
station
himself
on
a
free
seat
in
the
aisle
,
between
two
elderly
female
who
be
in
the
habit
of
receive
their
portion
of
a
weekly
dole
of
bread
then
set
forth
on
a
shelf
in
the
porch
.
<EOS>
in
this
conjunction
Mr
Toots
remain
,
greatly
disturb
the
congregation
,
who
feel
it
impossible
to
avoid
look
at
him
,
until
his
feeling
overcome
him
again
,
when
he
depart
silently
and
suddenly
.
<EOS>
not
venture
to
trust
himself
in
the
church
any
more
,
and
yet
wish
to
have
some
social
participation
in
what
be
go
on
there
,
Mr
Toots
be
after
this
,
see
from
time
to
time
,
look
in
,
with
a
lorn
aspect
,
at
one
or
other
of
the
window
;
and
as
there
be
several
window
accessible
to
him
from
without
,
and
as
his
restlessness
be
very
great
,
it
not
only
become
difficult
to
conceive
at
which
window
he
would
appear
next
,
but
likewise
become
necessary
,
as
it
be
,
for
the
whole
congregation
to
speculate
upon
the
chance
of
the
different
window
,
during
the
comparative
leisure
afford
them
by
the
sermon
.
<EOS>
Mr
Toots
's
movement
in
the
churchyard
be
so
eccentric
,
that
he
seem
generally
to
defeat
all
calculation
,
and
to
appear
,
like
the
conjuror
's
figure
,
where
he
be
least
expect
;
and
the
effect
of
these
mysterious
presentation
be
much
increase
by
its
be
difficult
to
him
to
see
in
,
and
easy
to
everybody
else
to
see
out
:
which
occasion
his
remaining
,
every
time
,
longer
than
may
have
be
expect
,
with
his
face
close
to
the
glass
,
until
he
all
at
once
become
aware
that
all
eye
be
upon
him
,
and
vanish
.
  
<EOS>
these
proceeding
on
the
part
of
Mr
Toots
,
and
the
strong
individual
consciousness
of
them
that
be
exhibit
by
the
Captain
,
render
Miss
Nipper
's
position
so
responsible
a
one
,
that
she
be
mightily
relieve
by
the
conclusion
of
the
service
;
and
be
hardly
so
affable
to
Mr
Toots
as
usual
,
when
he
inform
her
and
the
Captain
,
on
the
way
back
,
that
now
he
be
sure
he
have
no
hope
,
you
know
,
he
feel
more
comfortable
---
at
least
not
exactly
more
comfortable
,
but
more
comfortably
and
completely
miserable
.
  
<EOS>
swiftly
now
,
indeed
,
the
time
fly
by
until
it
be
the
evening
before
the
day
appoint

the

They
be

in
the
upper
room
at
the
Midshipman

,
and
have
no
fear
of
interruption
;
for
there
be
no
lodger
in
the
house
now
,
and
the
Midshipman
have
it
all
to
himself
.
<EOS>
They
be
grave
and
quiet
in
the
prospect
of
to

morrow
,
but
moderately
cheerful
too

and
cloud
have
come
and
go
;
the
ceaseless
work
of
Time
have
be
perform
,
in
storm
and
sunshine
.
<EOS>
through
a
whole
year
,
the
tide
of
human
chance
and
change
have
set
in
their
allot
course
.
<EOS>
through
a
whole
year
,
the
famous
House
of
Dombey
and
Son
have
fight
a
fight
for
life
,
against
cross
accident
,
doubtful
rumour
,
unsuccessful
venture
,
unpropitious
time
,
and
most
of
all
,
against
the
infatuation
of
its
head
,
who
would
not
contract
its
enterprise
by
a
hair
's
breadth
,
and
would
not
listen
to
a
word
of
warning
that
the
ship
he
strain
so
hard
against
the
storm
,
be
weak
,
and
could
not
bear
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
year
be
out
,
and
the
great
House
be
down
.
  
<EOS>
one
summer
afternoon
;
a
year
,
want
some
odd
day
,
after
the
marriage
in
the
City
church
;
there
be
a
buzz
and
whisper
upon
'
change
of
a
great
failure
.
<EOS>
a
certain
cold
proud
man
,
well
known
there
,
be
not
there
,
nor
be
he
represent
there
.
<EOS>
next
day
it
be
noise
abroad
that
Dombey
and
Son
have
stop
,
and
next
night
there
be
a
List
of
Bankrupts

,
head
by
that
name
.
  
<EOS>
the
world
be
very
busy
now
,
in
sooth
,
and
have
a
deal
to
say
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
innocently
credulous
and
a
much
ill
-
use
world
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
world
in
which
there
be
no
other
sort
of
bankruptcy
whatever
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
conspicuous
people
in
it
,
trade
far
and
wide
on
rotten
bank
of
religion
,
patriotism
,
virtue
,
honour
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
amount
worth
mentioning
of
mere
paper
in
circulation
,
on
which
anybody
live
pretty
handsomely
,
promise
to
pay
great
sum
of
goodness
with
no
effect
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
shortcoming
anywhere
,
in
anything
but
money
.
<EOS>
the
world
be
very
angry
indeed
;
and
the
people
especially
,
who
,
in
a
bad
world
,
may
have
be
suppose
to
be
bankrupt
trader
themselves
in
show
and
pretence
,
be
observe
to
be
mightily
indignant
.
  
<EOS>
here
be
a
new
inducement
to
dissipation
,
present
to
that
sport
of
circumstance
,
Mr
Perch
the
Messenger
!
<EOS>
It
be
apparently
the
fate
of
Mr
Perch
to
be
always
wake
up
,
and
find
himself
famous
.
<EOS>
He
have
but
yesterday
,
as
one
may
say
,
subside
into
private
life
from
the
celebrity
of
the
elopement
and
the
event
that
follow
it
;
and
now
he
be
make
a
more
important
man
than
ever
,
by
the
bankruptcy
.
<EOS>
glide
from
his
bracket
in
the
outer
office
where
he
now
sit
,
watch
the
strange
face
of
accountant
and
other
,
who
quickly
supersede
nearly
all
the
old
clerk
,
Mr
Perch
have
but
to
show
himself
in
the
court
outside
,
or
,
at
farthest
,
in
the
bar
of
the
King
's
arm
,
to
be
ask
a
multitude
of
question
,
almost
certain
to
include
that
interesting
question
,
what
would
he
take
to
drink
?
<EOS>
then
would
Mr
Perch
descant
upon
the
hour
of
acute
uneasiness
he
and
Mrs
Perch
have
suffer
out
at
Balls
Pond
,
when
they
first
suspect
"
thing
be
go
wrong
.
"
<EOS>
then
would
Mr
Perch
relate
to
gape
listener
,
in
a
low
voice
,
as
if
the
corpse
of
the
deceased
House
be
lie
unburied
in
the
next
room
,
how
Mrs
Perch
have
first
come
to
surmise
that
thing
be
go
wrong
by
hear
him
(
Perch
)
moan
in
his
sleep
,
"
twelve
and
ninepence
in
the
pound
,
twelve
and
ninepence
in
the
pound
!
"
<EOS>
which
act
of
somnambulism
he
suppose
to
have
originate
in
the
impression
make
upon
him
by
the
change
in
Mr
Dombey
's
face
.
<EOS>
then
would
he
inform
them
how
he
have
once
say
,
"
may
I
make
so
bold
as
ask
,
Sir
,
be
you
unhappy
in
your
mind
?
"
<EOS>
and
how
Mr
Dombey
have
reply
,
"
<EOS>
My
faithful
perch
---
<EOS>
but
no
,
it
can
not
be
!
"
<EOS>
and
with
that
have
strike
his
hand
upon
his
forehead
,
and
say
,
"
leave
me
,
Perch
!
"
<EOS>
then
,
in
short
,
would
Mr
Perch
,
a
victim
to
his
position
,
tell
all
manner
of
lie
;
affect
himself
to
tear
by
those
that
be
of
a
move
nature
,
and
really
believe
that
the
invention
of
yesterday
have
,
on
repetition
,
a
sort
of
truth
about
them
to
-
day
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Perch
always
close
these
conference
by
meekly
remarking
,
that
,
of
course
,
whatever
his
suspicion
may
have
be
(
as
if
he
have
ever
have
any
!
)
<EOS>
it
be
not
for
him
to
betray
his
trust
,
be
it
?
<EOS>
which
sentiment
(
there
never
be
any
creditor
present
)
be
receive
as
do
as
do
great
honour
to
his
feeling
.
<EOS>
thus
,
he
generally
bring
away
a
soothe
conscience
and
leave
an
agreeable
impression
behind
him
,
when
he
return
to
his
bracket
:
again
to
sit
watch
the
strange
face
of
the
accountant
and
other
,
make
so
free
with
the
great
mystery
,
the
book
;
or
now
and
then
to
go
on
tiptoe
into
Mr
Dombey
's
empty
room
,
and
stir
the
fire
;
or
to
take
an
airing
at
the
door
,
and
have
a
little
more
doleful
chat
with
any
straggler
whom
he
know
;
or
to
propitiate
,
with
various
small
attention
,
the
head
accountant
:
from
whom
Mr
Perch
have
expectation
of
a
messengership
in
a
Fire
Office
,
when
the
affair
of
the
House
should
be
wind
up
.
  
<EOS>
to
Major
Bagstock
,
the
bankruptcy
be
quite
a
calamity
.
<EOS>
the
Major
be
not
a
sympathetic
character
---
his
attention
be
wholly
concentrated
on
JB
---
nor
be
he
a
man
subject
to
lively
emotion
,
except
in
the
physical
regard
of
gasping
and
choking
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
so
parade
his
friend
Dombey
at
the
club
;
have
so
flourish
him
at
the
head
of
the
member
in
general
,
and
so
put
them
down
by
continual
assertion
of
his
rich
;
that
the
club
,
being
but
human
,
be
delighted
to
retort
upon
the
Major
,
by
ask
him
,
with
a
show
of
great
concern
,
whether
this
tremendous
smash
have
be
at
all
expect
,
and
how
his
friend
Dombey
bear
it
.
<EOS>
to
such
question
,
the
Major
,
wax
very
purple
,
would
reply
that
it
be
a
bad
world
,
Sir
,
altogether
;
that
Joey
know
a
thing
or
two
,
but
have
be
do
,
Sir
,
do
like
an
infant
;
that
if
you
have
foretold
this
,
Sir
,
to
J
Bagstock
,
when
he
go
abroad
with
Dombey
and
be
chase
that
vagabond
up
and
down
France
,
J
Bagstock
would
have
pooh
-
pooh'd
you
---
would
have
pooh
-
pooh'd
<EOS>
you
,
Sir
,
by
the
Lord
!
<EOS>
that
Joe
have
be
deceive
,
Sir
,
take
in
,
hoodwink
,
blindfold
,
but
be
broad
awake
again
and
stare
;
insomuch
,
Sir
,
that
if
Joe
's
father
be
to
rise
up
from
the
grave
to
-
morrow
,
he
would
not
trust
the
old
blade
with
a
penny
piece
,
but
would
tell
him
that
his
son
Josh
be
too
old
a
soldier
to
be
do
again
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
that
he
be
a
suspicious
,
crabbed
,
cranky
,
use
-
up
,
JB
infidel
,
Sir
;
and
that
if
it
be
consistent
with
the
dignity
of
a
rough
and
tough
old
Major
,
of
the
old
school
,
who
have
have
the
honour
of
be
personally
know
to
,
and
commend
by
,
their
late
Royal
highness
the
Dukes
of
Kent
and
York
,
to
retire
to
a
tub
and
live
in
it
,
by
Gad
!
<EOS>
Sir
,
he
would
have
a
tub
in
Pall
Mall
to
-
morrow
,
to
show
his
contempt
for
mankind
!
  
<EOS>
of
all
this
,
and
many
variation
of
the
same
tune
,
the
Major
would
deliver
himself
with
so
many
apoplectic
symptom
,
such
rolling
of
his
head
,
and
such
violent
growl
of
ill
usage
and
resentment
,
that
the
young
member
of
the
club
surmise
he
have
invest
money
in
his
friend
Dombey
's
House
,
and
lose
it
;
though
the
old
soldier
and
deep
dog
,
who
know
Joe
better
,
would
not
hear
of
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
Native
,
express
no
opinion
,
suffer
dreadfully
;
not
merely
in
his
moral
feeling
,
which
be
regularly
fusillade
by
the
Major
every
nour
in
the
day
,
and
riddle
through
and
through
,
but
in
his
sensitiveness
to
bodily
knock
and
bump
,
which
be
keep
continually
on
the
stretch
.
<EOS>
for
six
entire
week
after
the
bankruptcy
,
this
miserable
foreigner
live
in
a
rainy
season
of
boot
-
jack
and
brush
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Chick
have
three
idea
upon
the
subject
of
the
terrible
reverse
.
<EOS>
the
first
be
that
she
could
not
understand
it
.
<EOS>
the
second
,
that
her
brother
have
not
make
an
effort
.
<EOS>
the
third
,
that
if
she
have
be
invite
to
dinner
on
the
day
of
that
first
party
,
it
never
would
have
happen
;
and
that
she
have
say
so
,
at
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
nobody
's
opinion
stay
the
misfortune
,
lighten
it
,
or
make
it
heavy
.
<EOS>
It
be
understand
that
the
affair
of
the
House
be
to
be
wind
up
as
they
good
could
be
;
that
Mr
Dombey
freely
resign
everything
he
have
,
and
ask
for
no
favour
from
any
one
.
<EOS>
that
any
resumption
of
the
business
be
out
of
the
question
,
as
he
would
listen
to
no
friendly
negotiation
have
that
compromise
in
view
;
that
he
have
relinquish
every
post
of
trust
or
distinction
he
have
hold
,
as
a
man
respect
among
merchant
;
that
he
be
die
,
accord
to
some
;
that
he
be
go
melancholy
mad
,
accord
to
other
;
that
he
be
a
broken
man
,
accord
to
all
.
  
<EOS>
the
clerk
disperse
after
hold
a
little
dinner
of
condolence
among
themselves
,
which
be
enliven
by
comic
singing
,
and
go
off
admirably
.
<EOS>
some
take
place
abroad
,
and
some
engage
in
other
house
at
home
;
some
look
up
relation
in
the
country
,
for
whom
they
suddenly
remember
they
have
a
particular
affection
;
and
some
advertise
for
employment
in
the
newspaper
.
<EOS>
Mr
Perch
alone
remain
of
all
the
late
establishment
,
sit
on
his
bracket

at
the
accountant

or
start
off

,
to
propitiate
the
head
accountant
,
who
be
to
get
him
into
the
Fire
Office
.
<EOS>
the
Counting
House
soon
get
to
be
dirty
and
neglect
.
<EOS>
the
principal
slipper
and
dog
'
collar
seller
,
at
the
corner
of
the
court
,
would
have
doubt
the
propriety
of
throw
up
his
forefinger
to
the
brim
of
his
hat
,
any
more
,
if
Mr
Dombey
have
appear
there
now
;
and
the
ticket
porter
,
with
his
hand
under
his
white
apron
,
moralise
good
sound
morality
about
ambition
,
which
(
he
observe
)
be
not
,
in
his
opinion
,
make
to
rhyme
to
perdition
,
for
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Morfin
,
the
hazel
-
eyed
bachelor
,
with
the
hair
and
whisker
sprinkle
with
grey
,
be
perhaps
the
only
person
within
the
atmosphere
of
the
House
---
its
head
,
of
course
,
except
---
<EOS>
who
be
heartily
and
deeply
affect
by
the
disaster
that
have
befall
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
treat
Mr
Dombey
with
due
respect
and
deference
through
many
year
,
but
he
have
never
disguise
his
natural
character
,
or
meanly
truckle
to
him
,
or
pamper
his
master
passion
for
the
advancement
of
his
own
purpose
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
therefore
,
no
self
-
disrespect
to
avenge
;
no
long
-
tighten
spring
to
release
with
a
quick
recoil
.
<EOS>
He
work
early
and
late
to
unravel
whatever
be
complicated
or
difficult
in
the
record
of
the
transaction
of
the
House
;
be
always
in
attendance
to
explain
whatever
require
explanation
;
sit
in
his
old
room
sometimes
very
late
at
night
,

point
by
his
mastery
of
which
he
could
spare
Mr
Dombey
the
pain
of
be

and
then
would
go
home
to
Islington
,
and
calm
his
mind
by
produce
the
most
dismal
and
forlorn
sound
out
of
his
violoncello
before

to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
He

solace
himself
with
this
melodious
grumbler
one
evening
,
and

proceeding
of
the
day

when

consciousness
of

performance
than
a
sensation
of
something

and

on
the
sofa
with
great
tenderness
and
care
,

a
sign
that
the
lady
be
to

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
it
be
a
selfish
revelation
that
you

"
she
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
It

He
drum
with

after

pause

the

not

Miss

it
would
do

It

proof

without

<EOS>
Mr

incredulous

Cook

our

that
come

thank
God

Mr

expect
to
hear
it
report
that
the
Bank
of
England
's
a

go
to
break
,
or
the
jewel

<EOS>
but
,
next
come
the
Gazette
,
and
Mr
Perch
:
<EOS>
and
Mr
Perch
bring
Mrs
Perch
to
talk
it
over
in
the
kitchen
,
and
to
spend
a
pleasant
evening
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
there
be
no
doubt
about
it
,
Mr
Towlinson
's
main
anxiety
be
that
the
failure
should
be
a
good
round
one
---
not
less
than
a
hundred
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
Mr
Perch
do
not
think
himself
that
a
hundred
thousand
pound
will
nearly
cover
it

<EOS>
the
woman

"
a

<EOS>
with
awful
satisfaction
---
as
if
handle
the
word

and
the
housemaid

who
have
her
eye
on
Mr
Towlinson
,
wish
she
have
only
a
hundredth
part
of
the
sum
to
bestow
on
the
man
of
her
choice
.
<EOS>
Mr
Towlinson
,
still
mindful
of
his
old
wrong
,
opine
that
a
foreigner
would
hardly
know
what
to
do
with
so
much
money
,
unless
he
spend
it
on
his
whisker
;
which
bitter
sarcasm
cause
the
housemaid
to
withdraw
in
tear
.
  
<EOS>
but
not
to
remain
long
absent
;
for
Cook

who

good

say
,
whatever
they
do
,
let
'em
stand
by
one
another
now
,
Towlinson

for
there
be
no

how
soon
they

<EOS>
They
have
be
in
that
house
(
say
Cook
)
through
a
funeral
,
a
wedding
,
and
a
running

away
;
and
let
it
not
be
say
that
they
could
not
agree
among
themselves
at
such
a
time
as
the

<EOS>
Mrs

<EOS>
Mr

reply
to
Cook
,
far
be
it
from
him
to
stand
in
the
way
of
that
good
feeling
which
he
could
wish
to
see
;
and
adjourn
in
quest
of
the
housemaid
,
and
presently
return
with
that
young
lady
on
his
arm
,
inform
the
kitchen
that
foreigner
be
only
his
fun
,
and
that

and
Anne

another
for

for

and
to

<EOS>
Misfortune

Could

<EOS>
therefore

or
two
for

,
and
Mr

compound
a
lobster
salad
to
be
devoted
to
the

hospitable
purpose
.
<EOS>
even
Mrs

<EOS>
there
be
a
little
talk
about
Mr
Dombey

but
very
little
.
<EOS>
It
be
chiefly
speculation
as
to
how
long
he
have
know
that
this
be
go
to
happen
.
<EOS>
Cook
say
shrewdly
,
"
oh
a
long
time
,
bless
you
!
<EOS>
take
your
oath
of
that

"
<EOS>
and
reference
be
make
to
Mr
Perch
,
he
confirm
her
view
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
somebody
wonder
what
he
will
do
,
and
whether
he
will
go
out
in
any
situation
.
<EOS>
Mr
Towlinson
think
not
,
and
hint
at
a
refuge
in
one
of
them

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah

say
Cook
plaintively

and
bring
up
sweet
pea
in
the
spring
.

<EOS>
"
exactly
so

say
Mr

We

<EOS>
"
how

<EOS>
"

"
observe
the
housemaid
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
wonderful
how
good

these
reflection

and
what
a
christian
unanimity
they
be
sensible
of

in
bear
the

shock
with
resignation

<EOS>
there
be
only
one
interruption
to
this
excellent
state
of

which

and
request
to
know
how
she
dare
insult
the
family
,
whose
bread
she
eat

by
such
a
dishonest
supposition
,
and
whether
she
think
that
anybody
,
with
a
scrap
of
honour
leave
,
could
deprive
poor
servant
of
their
pittance
?

<EOS>
because

down

go
back

jar
its

house
that
the
rat

flee
from
:
hiding
,
in
a
fright
at
every
sound
,
steal
in
and
out
like
a
criminal

only
desire
to
be
true

the
fall
object

admiration

unknown
to

unknown

one
poor
simple
woman

the
major
know
it
;

sometimes

He

He

He

<EOS>
He

up
any
more

<EOS>
for
the
night
of
his
worldly
ruin
there
be
no

morrow
's
sun
;
for
the
stain
of
his
domestic
shame
there
be
no
purification
;
nothing
,
thank
Heaven
,
could
bring
his
dead
child
back
to
life
.
<EOS>
but
that
which
he
may
have
make
so
different
in
all
the
past
---
which
may
have
make
the
past
itself
so
different
,
though
this
he
hardly
think
of
now
---
that
which
be
his
own
work
,
that
which
he
could
so
easily
have
work
into
a
blessing
,
and
have
set
himself
so
steadily
for
year
to
form
into
a
curse
:
that
be
the
sharp
grief
of
his
soul
.
  
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
He
do
remember
it
!
<EOS>
the
rain
that
fall
upon
the
roof
,
the
wind
that
mourn
outside
the
door
that
night
,
have
have
foreknowledge
in
their
melancholy
sound
.
<EOS>
He
know
,
now
,
what
he
have
do
.
<EOS>
He
know
,
now
,
that
he
have
call
down
that
upon
his
head
,
which
bow

heavy
stroke
of
fortune

<EOS>
He
know
,
now
,
what
it
be
to
be
reject
and
desert
;
now

when
every
love
blossom
he
have
wither
in
his
innocent
daughter

heart
be
snow
down
in
ashe
on
him

<EOS>
He
think
of
her
,
as
she
have
be
that
night
when
he
and
his
bride
come
home
.
<EOS>
He
think
of
her
as
she
have
be
,
in
all
the
home

event
,
of
the
abandon
House

<EOS>
He
think
,
now
,
that
of
all
around
him
,
she
alone
have
never
change
.
<EOS>
His
boy
have
fade
into
dust
,
his
proud
wife
have
sink
into
a
polluted
creature
,
his
flatterer
and
friend
have
be
transform
into
the
bad
of
villain
,
his
rich
have
melt
away
,
the
very
wall
that
shelter
him
look
on
him
as
a
stranger
;
she
alone
have
turn
the
same
mild
gentle
look
upon
him
always
.
<EOS>
yes
,
to
the
late
and
the
last
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
change
to
him
---
nor
have
he
ever
change
to
her
---
and
she
be
lose
.
  
<EOS>
as
,
one
by
one
,
they
fall
away
before
his
mind
---
<EOS>
his
baby
-
hope
,
his
wife
,
his
friend
,
his
fortune
---
oh
how
the
mist
,
through
which
he
have
see
her
,
clear
,
and
show
him
her
true
self
!
<EOS>
oh
,
how
much
well
than
this
that
he
have
love
her
as
have
hide
boy
,
and
lose
her
as
he
have
his
boy
,
and
lay
them
in
their
early
grave
together
!
  
<EOS>
in
his
pride
---
for
he
be
proud
yet
---
<EOS>
he
let
the
world
go
from
him
freely
.
<EOS>
as
it
fall
away
,
he
shake
it
off
.
<EOS>
whether
he
imagine
its
face
as
express
pity
for
him
,
or
indifference
to
him
,
he
shun
it
alike
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
same
degree
to
be
avoid
,
in
either
aspect
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
idea
of
any
one
companion
in
his
misery
,
but
the
one
he
have
drive
away
.
<EOS>
what
he
would
have
say
to
her
,
or
what
consolation
submit
to
receive
from
her
,
he
never
picture
to
himself
.
<EOS>
but
he
always
know
she
would
have
be
true
to
him
,
if
he
have
suffer
her
.
<EOS>
He
always
know
she
would
have
love
him
better
now
,
than
at
any
other
time
:
he
be
as
certain
that
it
be
in
her
nature
,
as
he
be
that
there
be
a
sky
above
him
;
and
he
sit
think
so
,
in
his
loneliness
,
from
hour
to
hour
.
<EOS>
day
after
day
utter
this
speech
;
night
after
night
show
him
this
knowledge
.
  
<EOS>
It
begin
,
beyond
all
doubt
(
however
slow
it
advance
for
some
time
)
,
in
the
receipt
of
her
young
husband
's
letter
,
and
the
certainty
that
she
be
go
.
<EOS>
and
yet
---
so
proud
he
be
in
his
ruin
,
or
so
reminiscent
of
her
,
only
as
something
that
may
have
be
his
,
but
be
lose
beyond
redemption
---
that
if
he
could
have
hear
her
voice
in
an
adjoining
room
,
he
would
not
have
go
to
her
.
<EOS>
if
he
could
have
see
her
in
the
street
,
and
she
have
do
no
more
than
look
at
him
as
she
have
be
use
to
look
,
he
would
have
pass
on
with
his
old
cold
unforgiving
face
,
and
not
address
her
,
or
relax
it
,
though
his
heart
should
have
break
soon
afterwards
.
<EOS>
however
turbulent
his
thought
,
or
harsh
be
anger
have
be
,
at
first
,
concern
her
marriage
,
or
her
husband
<EOS>
,
that
be
all
past
now
.
<EOS>
He
chiefly
think
of
what
may
have
be
,
and
what
be
not
.
<EOS>
what
be
,
be
all
sum
up
in
this
:
that
she
be
lose
,
and
he
bow
down
with
sorrow
and
remorse
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
he
feel
that
he
have
have
two
child
bear
to
him
in
that
house
,
and
that
between
him
and
the
bare
wide
empty
wall
there
be
a
tie
,
mournful
,
but
hard
to
rend
asunder
,
connect
with
a
double
childhood
,
and
a
double
loss
.
<EOS>
He
have
think
to
leave
the
house
---
know
he
must
go
,
not
know
whither
---
upon
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
this
feel
first
strike
root
in
his
breast
;
but
he
resolve
to
stay
another
night
,
and
in
the
night
to
ramble
through
the
room
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
out
of
his
solitude
when
it
be
the
dead
of
night
,
and
with
a
candle
in
his
hand
go
softly
up
the
stair
.
<EOS>
of
all
the
footmark
there
,
make
them
as
common
as
the
common
street
,
there
be
not
one
,
he
think
,
but
have
seem
at
the
time
to
set
itself
upon
his
brain
while
he
have
keep
close
,
listen
.
<EOS>
He
look
at
their
number
,
and
their
hurry
,
and
contention
---
foot
tread
foot
out
,
and
upward
track
and
downward
jostle
one
another
---
and
think
,
with
absolute
dread
and
wonder
,
how
much
he
must
have
suffer
during
that
trial
,
and
what
a
changed
man
he
have
cause
to
be
.
<EOS>
He
think
,
besides
,
oh
be
there
,
somewhere
in
the
world
,
a
light
footstep
that
may
have
wear
out
in
a
moment
half
those
mark
!

as
he
go
up

He
almost
see
it

go
on
before

<EOS>
He
stop
,
look
up
towards
the
skylight
;
and
a
figure
,
childish
itself
,
but
carry
a
child
,
and
singe
as
it
go
,
seem
to
be
there
again
.
<EOS>
Anon
,
it
be
the
same
figure
,
alone
,
stop
for
an
instant
,
with
suspend
breath
;
the
bright
hair
cluster
loosely
round
its
tearful
face
;
and
look
back
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
wander
through
the
room
:
lately
so
luxurious
;
now
so
bare
and
dismal
and
so
changed
,
apparently
,
even
in
their
shape
and
size
.
<EOS>
the
press
of
footstep
be
as
thick
here
;
and
the
same
consideration
of
the
suffering
he
have
have
,
perplex
and
terrify
him
.
<EOS>
He
begin
to
fear
that
all
this
intricacy
in
his
brain
would
drive
him
mad
;
and
that
his
thought
already
lose
coherence
as
the
footprint
do
,
and
be
piece
on
to
one
another
,
with
the
same
trackless
involution
,
and
variety
of
indistinct
shape
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
so
much
as
know
in
which
of
these
room
she
have
live
,
when
she
be
alone

He
be
glad
to
leave
them
,
and
go
wander
high
up

<EOS>
abundance
of
association
be
here
,
connect
with
his
false
wife
,
his
false
friend
and
servant
,
his
false
ground
of
pride
;
but
he
put
them
all
by
now
,
and
only
recall
miserably
,
weakly
,
fondly
,
his
two
child
.
  
<EOS>
everywhere
,
the
footstep
!
<EOS>
They
have
have
no
respect
for
the
old
room
high
up
,
where
the
little
bed
have
be
;
he
could
hardly
find
a
clear
space
there
,
to
throw
himself
down
,
on
the
floor
,
against
the
wall
,
poor
broken
man
,
and
let
his
tear
flow
as
they
would
.
<EOS>
He
have
shed
so
many
tear
here
,
long
ago
,
that
he
be
less
ashamed
of
his
weakness
in
this
place
than
in
any
other
---
perhaps
,
with
that
consciousness
,
have
make
excuse
to
himself
for
come
here
.
<EOS>
here
,
with
stoop
shoulder
,
and
his
chin
drop
on
his
breast
,
he
have
come
.
<EOS>
here
,
throw
upon
the
bare
board
,
in
the
dead
of
night
,
he
weep
,
alone
---
a
proud
man
,
even
then
;
who
,
if
a
kind
hand
could
have
be
stretch
out
,
or
a
kind
face
could
have
look
in
would
have
rise
up
,
and
turn
away
,
and
go
down
to
his
cell
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
day
break
he
be
shut
up
in
his
room
again
.
<EOS>
He
have
mean
to
go
away
to
-
day
,
but
clung
to
this
tie
in
the
house
as
<EOS>
the
last
and
only
thing
leave
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
to

morrow
.
<EOS>
to

morrow
come
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
to

morrow
.
<EOS>
every
night
,
within
the
knowledge
of
no
human
creature
,
he
come
forth
,
and
wander
through
the
despoiled
house
like
a
ghost
.
<EOS>
many
a
morning
when
the
day
break
,
his
altered
face
,
droop
behind
the
closed
blind
in
his
window
,
imperfectly
transparent
to
the
light
as
yet
,
ponder
on
the
loss
of
his
two
child
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
child
no
more
.
<EOS>
He
reunite
them
in
his
thought
,
and
they
be
never
asunder
.
<EOS>
oh
,
that
he
could
have
unite
them
in
his
past
love
,
and
in
death
,
and
that
one
have
not
be
so
much
bad
than
dead
!
  
<EOS>
strong
mental
agitation
and
disturbance
be
no
novelty
to
him
,
even
before
his
late
suffering
.
<EOS>
It
never
be

obstinate
and
sullen
nature

for
they
struggle
hard

often
fall
down

in

,
weaken
,
and
crumble
,
little
by
little
,
more
and
more

as
the
hand
move
on
the

.
  
<EOS>
at
last
he
begin
to
think
he
nee
not
go
at
all
.
<EOS>
He
may
yet
give
up
what
his
creditor
have
spare
him
(
that
they
have
not
spare
him
more
,
be
his
own
act
)
,
and
only
sever
the
tie
between
him
and
the
ruin
house
,
by
sever
that
other
link
  
<EOS>
It
be
then
that
his
footfall
be
audible
in
the
late
house
-
keeper
's
room
,
as
he
walk
to
and
fro
;
but
not
audible
in
its
true
meaning
,

it
would
have
have
an
appalling
sound
.
  
<EOS>
the
world
be
very
busy
and
restless
about
him
.
<EOS>
He
become
aware
of
that
again

<EOS>
It
be
whisper
and
babble
.
<EOS>
It
be
never

<EOS>
this

the
intricacy
and
complication
of
the

him
to
death

<EOS>
object
begin
to
take
a
blear

russet
colour
in
his

<EOS>
Dombey

<EOS>
this
must
be

to

<EOS>
He
think
of
it
to

morrow
;
and
sit
think
in
his
chair
,
see
in
the
glass
,
from
time
to
time
,
this
picture
:
  
a
spectral
,
haggard
,
waste
likeness
of
himself
,
brood
and
brood
over
the
empty
fireplace
.
<EOS>
now
it
lift
up
its
head
,
examine
the
line
and
hollow
in
its
face
;
now
hang
it
down
again
,
and
brood
afresh
.
<EOS>
now
it
rise
and
walk
about
;
now
pass
into
the
next
room
,
and
come
back
with
something
from
the
dressing

table
in
its
breast
.
<EOS>
now
,
it
be
look
at
the
bottom
of
the
door
,
and
thinking
.
   
<EOS>
---
Hush
!
<EOS>
what
?
  
<EOS>
It
be
think
that
if
blood
be
to
trickle
that
way
,
and
to
leak
out
into
the
hall
,
it
must
be
a
long
time
go
so
far
.
<EOS>
It
would
move
so
stealthily
and
slowly
,
creep
on
,
with
her
a
lazy
little
pool
,
and
there
a
start
,
and
then
another
little
pool
,
that
a
desperately
wound
man
could
only
be
discover
through
its
mean
,
either
dead
or
die
.
<EOS>
when
it
have
think
of
this
a
long
while
,
it
get
up
again
,
and
walk
to

fro
with
its
hand
in
its
breast
.
<EOS>
He
glance
at
it
occasionally
,
very
curious
to
watch
its
motion
,
and
he
mark
how
wicked
and
murderous
that
hand
look
.
  
<EOS>
now
it
be
think
again
!
<EOS>
what
be
it
think
?
  
<EOS>
whether
they
would
tread
in
the
blood
when
it
creep
so
far
,
and
carry
it
about
the
house
among
those
many
print
of
foot
,
or
even
out
into
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
It
sit
down
,
with
its
eye
upon
the
empty
fireplace
,
and
as
it
lose
itself
in
thought
there
shine
into
the
room
a
gleam
of
light
;
a
ray
of
sun
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
unmindful

suddenly
it
rise
,
with
a
terrible
face

that
guilty
hand
grasp
what

then
it
be
arrest
by
a
cry

a
wild

loud

pierce

love
rapturous

<EOS>
His
wife
,
with
her
old
manner
suddenly
resort
,
so
pathetically
entreat
him
to
take
her
to
her
precious
pet
,
her
little
mistress
,
her
own
darling
,
and
the
like

that
Mr

whose
sympathy

admiration
be
of
the
strong
kind

consent
from
his
very
heart
of
heart

they
agree
to
depart
immediately
,
and
present
themselves
in
answer
to
the
Captain

letter
.
  
<EOS>
now
some
hide
sympathy
of
thing
,
or
some
coincidence
,
have
that
day
bring
the
Captain
himself
(
toward
whom
Mr

Mrs
Toots
be
soon
journey
)
into
the
flowery
train
of
wedlock
;
not
as
a
principal

as
an
accessory

<EOS>
It
happen
accidentally
,
and
thus
:
  
the
Captain
,
have
see
Florence
and
her
baby
for
a
moment
,
to
his
unbounded
content
,
and
have
have
a
long
talk
with
Walter
,
turn
out
for
a
walk
;
feel
it
necessary
to
have
some
solitary
meditation
on
the
change
of
human
affair
,
and
to
shake
his
glaze
hat
profoundly
over
the
fall
of
Mr
Dombey
,
for
whom
the
generosity
and
simplicity
of
his
nature
be
awaken
in
a
lively
manner

<EOS>
the
Captain
would
have
be
very
low
,
indeed
,
on
the
unhappy
gentleman
's
account
,
but
for
the
recollection
of
the
baby
;
which
afford
him
such
intense
satisfaction
whenever
it
arise
,
that
he
laugh
aloud
as
he
go
along
the
street
,
and
,
indeed
,
more
than
once
,
in
a
sudden
impulse
of
joy
,
throw
up
his
glaze
hat
and
catch
it
again
;
much
to
the
amazement
of
the
spectator

<EOS>
the
rapid
alternation
of
light
and
shade
to
which
these
two
conflict
subject
of
reflection
expose
the
Captain

be
so
very
try
to
his
spirit

that
he
feel
a
long
walk
necessary
to
his
composure
;
and
as
there
be
a
great
deal
in
the
influence
of
harmonious
association

he
choose
,
for
the
scene
of
this
walk

his

these

the

thereabout

be
so
influential

under

arm

no

sagacious

melancholy
visage

meekly
resign

<EOS>
the
first
impulse

the
Captain

to
run
away

this
also
appear
to
be
the
first
impulse

Bunsby

hopeless

its
execution
must
have
prove

he
learn
from
this
lady
that
she
be
the
widow
of
a
Mr
Bokum
,
who
have
hold
and
employment
in
the
Custom
House
;
that
she
be
the
dear
friend
of
Mrs
MacStinger
,
whom
she
consider
a
pattern
for
her
sex
;
that
she
have
often
hear
of
the
Captain
,
and
now
hope
he
have
repent
of
his
past
life
;
that
she
trust
<EOS>
Mr
Bunsby
know
what
a
blessing
he
have
gain
,
but
that
she
fear
man
seldom
do
know
what
such
blessing
be
,
until
they
have
lose
them
;
with
more
to
the
same
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
time
,
the
Captain
could
not
but
observe
that
Mrs
Bokum
keep
her
eye
steadily
on
the
bridegroom
,
and
that
whenever
they
come
near
a
court
or
other
narrow
turning
which
appear
favourable
for
flight
,
she
be
on
the
alert
to
cut
him
off
if
he
attempt
escape
.
<EOS>
the
other
lady
,
too
,
as
well
as
her
husband
,
the
short
gentleman
with
the
tall
hat
,
be
plainly
on
guard
,
accord
to
a
preconcerte
plan
;
and
the
wretched
man
be
so
secure
by
Mrs
MacStinger
,
that
any
effort
at
self
-
preservation
by
flight
be
render
futile
.
<EOS>
this
,
indeed
,
be
apparent
to
the
mere
populace
,
who
express
their
perception
of
the
fact
by
jeer
and
cry
;
to
all
of
which
,
the
dread
MacStinger
be
inflexibly
indifferent
,
while
Bunsby
himself
appear
in
a
state
of
unconsciousness
.
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
make
many
attempt
to
accost
the
philosopher
,
if
only
in
a
monosyllable
or
a
signal
;
but
always
fail
,
in
consequence
of
the
vigilance
of
the
guard
,
and
the
difficulty
,
at
all
time
peculiar
to
Bunsby
's
constitution
,
of
have
his
attention
arouse
by
any
outward
any
visible
sign
whatever
.
<EOS>
thus
they
approach
the
chapel
,
a
neat
whitewash
edifice
,
recently
engage
by
the
Reverend
Melchisedech
Howler
,
who
have
consent
,
on
very
urgent
solicitation
,
to
give
the
world
another
two
year
of
existence
,
but
have
inform
his
follower
that
,
then
,
it
must
positively
go
.
  
<EOS>
while
the
Reverend
Melchisedech
be
offer
up
some
extemporary
orison
,
the
Captain
find
an
opportunity
of
growl
in
the
bridegroom
's
ear
:
  
<EOS>
"
what
cheer
,
my
lad
,
what
cheer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
to
which
Bunsby
reply
,
with
a
forgetfulness
of
the
Reverend
Melchisedech
,
which
nothing
but
his
desperate
circumstance
could
have
excuse
:
  
"
D

bad

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jack
Bunsby

whisper
the
Captain

"
do

"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Bunsby
answer
"
no

"
   
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
do
it
,
then
,
my
lad
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
the
Captain
,
not
unnaturally
.
  
<EOS>
Bunsby
,
still
look
,
and
always
look
with
an
immovable
countenance
,
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
world
,
make
no
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
not
sheer
off
?
"
say
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
eh
?
"
whisper
Bunsby
,
with
a
momentary
gleam
of
hope
.
  
<EOS>
"
sheer
off
,
"
say
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
the

<EOS>
"
retort
the
forlorn
sage
.
<EOS>
"
She
would
capter

"
  
<EOS>
"

the

"
  
<EOS>
Jack
Bunsby
,
however
,
instead
of
profit
by
the
advice
,
say
in
a
doleful
whisper
:
  
"
It
all

in

that
night

"
  
<EOS>
"
My

falter
the
Captain

"
I

"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Bunsby
merely
utter
a
suppress
groan
.
  
<EOS>
"
come

"
say
the
Captain
,
nudge
him
with
his
elbow
,
"
now

your

<EOS>
sheer

<EOS>
I
will

It

Will

Bunsby

<EOS>
"
Bunsby

"
whisper
the
Captain
,
"
will
you
twice

"
  
<EOS>
Bunsby
would
not
twice

<EOS>
"
Bunsby
!
"
urge
the
Captain
,
"
it
be
for
liberty

will
you
three

<EOS>
now

never

"
  
<EOS>
Bunsby
do
not
then
,
and
do
not
ever
;
for
Mrs
MacStinger
immediately
afterwards
marry
him
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
the
most
frightful
circumstance
of
the
ceremony
to
the
Captain
,
be
the
deadly
interest
exhibit
therein
by
Juliana
MacStinger
;
and
the
fatal
concentration
of
her
faculty
,
with
which
that
promise
child
,
already
the
image
of
her
parent
,
observe
the
whole
proceeding
.
<EOS>
the
Captain
see
in
this
a
succession
of
man
-
trap
stretch
out
infinitely
;
a
series
of
age
of
oppression
and
coercion
,
through
which
the
seafare
line
be
doom
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
more
memorable
sight
than
the
unflinche
steadiness
of
Mrs
Bokum
and
the
other
lady
,
the
exultation
of
the
short
gentleman
in
the
tall
hat
,
or
even
the
fell
inflexibility
of
Mrs
MacStinger
.
<EOS>
the
Master
MacStingers
understand
little
of
what
be
go
on
,
and
care
less
;
be
chiefly
engage
,
during
the
ceremony
,
in
tread
on
one
another
be
half
-
boot
;
but
the
contrast
afford
by
those
wretched
infant
only
set
off
and
adorn
the
precocious
woman
in
Juliana
.
<EOS>
another
year
or
two
,
the
Captain
think
,
and
to
lodge
where
that
child
be
,
would
be
destruction
.
  
<EOS>
the
ceremony
be
conclude
by
a
general
spring
of
the
young
family
on
Mr
Bunsby
,
whom
they
hail
by
the
endearing
name
of
father
,
and
from
whom
they
solicit
half
-
pence
.
<EOS>
these
gush
of
affection
over
,
the
procession
be
about
to
issue
forth
again
,
when
it
be
delay
for
some
little
time
by
an
unexpected
transport
on
the
part
of
Alexander
MacStinger
.
<EOS>
that
dear
child
,
it
seem
,
connect
a
chapel
with
tombstones
,
when
it
be
enter
for
any
purpose
apart
from
the
ordinary
religious
exercise
,
could
not
be
persuade
but
that
his
mother
be
now
to
be
decently
inter
,
and
lose
to
him
for
ever
.
<EOS>
in
the
anguish
of
this
conviction
,
he
scream
with
astonishing
force
,
and
turn
black
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
however
touch
these
mark
of
a
tender
disposition
be
to
his
mother
,
it
be
not
in
the
character
of
that
remarkable
woman
to
permit
her
recognition
of
them
to
degenerate
into
weakness
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
after
vainly
endeavour
to
convince
his
reason
by
shake
,
poke
,
bawling
-
out
,
and
similar
application
to
his
head
,
she
lead
him
into
the
air
,
and
try
another
method
;
which
be
manifest
to
the
marriage
party
by
a
quick
succession
of
sharp
sound
,
resemble
applause
,
and
subsequently
,
by
their
see
Alexander
in
contact
with
the
cool
paving
-
stone
in
the
court
,
greatly
flush
,
and
loudly
lament
.
  
<EOS>
the
procession
be
then
in
a
condition
to
from
itself
once
more
,
and
repair
to
Brig
Place
,
where
a
marriage
feast
be
in
readiness
,
return
as
it
have
come
;
not
without
the
receipt
,
by
Bunsby
,
of
many
humorous
congratulation
from
the
populace
on
his
recently
-
acquire
happiness
.
<EOS>
the
Captain
accompany
it
as
far
as
the
house
-
door
,
but
,
be
make
uneasy
by
the
gentle
manner
of
Mrs
Bokum
,
who
,
now
that
she
be
relieve
from
her
engross
duty
---
for
the
watchfulness
and
alacrity
of
the
lady
sensibly
diminish
when
the
bridegroom
be
safely
married
---
have
great
leisure
to
show
an
interest
in
his
behalf
,
there
leave
it
and
the
captive
;
faintly
plead
an
appointment
,
and
promise
to
return
presently
.
<EOS>
the
Captain
have
another
cause
for
uneasiness
,
in
remorsefully
reflect
that
he
have
be
the
first
mean
of
Bunsby
's
entrapment
,
though
certainly
without
intend
it
,
and
through
his
unbounded
faith
in
the
resource
of
that
philosopher
.
  
<EOS>
to
go
back
to
old
Sol
Gills
at
the
Wooden
Midshipman
's
,
and
not
first
go
round
to
ask
how
Mr
Dombey
fare
---
<EOS>
albeit
the
house
where
he
lie
be
out
of
London
,
and
away
on
the
border
of
a
fresh
heath
---
be
quite
out
of
the
Captain
's
course
.
<EOS>
so
he
get
a
lift
when
he
be
tired
,
and
make
out
the
journey
gaily
.
  
<EOS>
the
blind
be
pull
down
,
and
the
house
so
quiet
,
that
the
Captain
be
almost
afraid
to
knock
;
but
listen
at
the
door
,
he
hear
low
voice
within
,
very
near
it
,
and
knock
softly
,
be
admit
by
Mr
Toots
.
<EOS>
Mr

and
his
wife
have
,
in
fact

just
arrive
there
;
have
be
at
the
Midshipman

to
seek
him
,
and
have
there
obtain
the
address
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
not
so
recently
arrive
,
but
that
Mrs
Toots
have
catch
the
baby
from
somebody
,
take
it
in
her
arm
,
and
sit
down
on
the
stair
,
hugging

fondle
it

<EOS>
Her

need

,
and
make
the
aid
of
her
old
friend
invaluable
.
<EOS>
death
stand
at
his
pillow
.
<EOS>
a
shade
,
already
,
of
what
he
have
be
,
shatter
in
mind
,
and
perilously
sick
in
body
,
he
lay
his
weary
head
down
on
the
bed
his
daughter
's
hand
prepare
for
him
,
and
have
never
raise
it
since
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
always
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
know
her
,
generally
;
though
,
in
the
wandering
of
his
brain
,
he
often
confuse
the
circumstance
under
which
he
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
thus
he
would
address
her
,
sometimes
,
as
if
his
boy
be
newly
dead
;
and
would
tell
her
,
that
although
he
have
say
nothing
of
her
ministering
at
the
little
bedside
,
yet
he
have
see
it
---
he
have
see
it
;
and
then
would
hide
his
face
and
sob
,
and
put
out
his
worn
hand
.
<EOS>
sometimes
he
would
ask
her
for
herself
.
<EOS>
"
where
be
Florence
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
be
here
,
Papa
,
I
be
here
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
her
!
"
<EOS>
he
would
cry
"
We
have
be
part
so
long
,
that
I
do
not
know
her
!
"
<EOS>
and
and
then
a
stare
dread
would
be
upon
him
,
until
she
could
soothe
his
perturbation
;
and
recall
the
tear
she
try
so
hard
,
at
other
time
,
to
dry
.
  
<EOS>
He
ramble
through
the
scene
of
his
old
pursuit
---
through
many
where
Florence
lose
him
as
she
listen
---
sometimes
for
hour
.
<EOS>
He
would
repeat
that
childish
question
,
"
<EOS>
what
be
money
?
"
and
ponder
on
it
,
and
think
about
it
,
and
reason
with
himself
,
more
or
less
connectedly
,
for
a
good
answer
;
as
if
it
have
never
be
propose
to
him
until
that
moment
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
on
with
a
musing
repetition
of
the
title
of
his
old
firm
twenty
thousand
time
,
and
at
every
one
of
them
,
would
turn
his
head
upon
his
pillow
.
<EOS>
He
would
count
his
child
---
one
---
two
---
stop
,
and
go
back
,
and
begin
again
in
the
same
way
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
be
when
his
mind
be
in
its
most
distracted
state
.
<EOS>
in
all
the
other
phase
of
its
illness
,
and
in
those
to
which
it
be
most
constant
,
it
always
turn
on
Florence
.
<EOS>
what
he
would
oftenest
do
be
this
<EOS>
:
he
would
recall
that
night
<EOS>
he
have
so
recently
remember
,
the
night
on
which
she
come
down
to
his
room
,
and
would
imagine
that
his
heart
smite
him
,
and
that
he
go
out
after
her
,
and
up
the
stair
to
seek
her
.
<EOS>
then
,
confound
that
time
with
the
later
day
of
the
many
footstep
,
he
would
be
amazed
at
their
number
,
and
begin
to
count
them
as
he
follow
her
.
<EOS>
here
,
of
a
sudden
,
be
a
bloody
footstep
go
on
among
the
other
;
and
after
it
there
begin
to
be
,
at
interval
,
door
stand
open
,
through
which
certain
terrible
picture
be
see
,
in
mirror
,
of
haggard
man
,
conceal
something
in
their
breast
.
<EOS>
still
,
among
the
many
footstep
and
the
bloody
footstep
here
and
there
,
be
the
step
of
Florence
.
<EOS>
still
she
be
go
on
before
.
<EOS>
still
the
restless
mind
go
,
follow
and
count
,
ever
farther
,
ever
high
,
as
to
the
summit
of
a
mighty
tower
that
it
take
year
to
climb
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
he
inquire
if
that
be
not
Susan
who
have
speak
a
long
while
ago
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
say
"
yes
,
dear
papa
;
"
and
ask
him
would
he
like
to
see
her
?
  
<EOS>
He
say
"
very
much
.
"
<EOS>
and
Susan
,
with
no
little
trepidation
,
show
herself
at
his
bedside
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
a
great
relief
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
beg
her
not
to
go
;
to
understand
that
he
forgive
her
what
she
have
say
;
and
that
she
be
to
stay
.
<EOS>
Florence
and
he
be
very
different
now
,
he
say
,
and
very
happy
.
<EOS>
let
her
look
at
this
!
<EOS>
He
mean
his
draw
gentle
head
down
to
his
pillow
,
and
lay
it
beside
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
remain
like
this
for
day
and
week
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
lying
,
the
faint
feeble
semblance
of
a
man
,
upon
his
bed
,
and
speak
in
a
voice
so
low
that
they
could
only
hear
him
by
listen
very
near
to
his
lip
,
he
become
quiet
.
<EOS>
It
be
dimly
pleasant
to
him
now
,
to
lie
their
,
with
the
window
open
,
look
out
at
the
summer
sky
and
the
tree
:
and
,
in
the
evening
,
at
the
sunset
.
<EOS>
to
watch
the
shadow
of
the
cloud
and
leave
,
and
seem
to
feel
a
sympathy
with
shadow
.
<EOS>
It
be
natural
that
he
should
.
<EOS>
to
him
,
life
and
the
world
be
nothing
else
.
  
<EOS>
He
begin
to
show
now
that
he
think
of
Florence
's
fatigue
:
and
often
tax
his
weakness
to
whisper
to
her
,
"
go
and
walk
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
in
the
sweet
air
,
go
to
your
good
husband
!
"
<EOS>
one
time
when
Walter
be
in
his
room
,
he
beckon
him
to
come
near
,
and
to
stoop
down
;
and
press
his
hand
,
whisper
an
assurance
to
him
that
he
know
he
could
trust
him
with
his
child
when
he
be
dead
.
  
<EOS>
It
chance
one
evening
,
towards
sunset
,
when
Florence
and
Walter
be
sit
in
his
room
together
,
as
he
like
to
see
them
,
that
Florence
,
have
her
baby
in
her
arm
,
begin
in
a
low
voice
to
sing
to
the
little
fellow
,
and
sing
the
old
tune
she
have
so
often
sing
to
the
dead
child
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
it
at
the
time
;
he
hold
up
his
tremble
hand
,
implore
her
to
stop
;
but
next
day
he
ask
her
to
repeat
it
,
and
to
do
so
often
of
an
evening
:
which
she
do
.
<EOS>
He
listen
,
with
his
face
turn
away
.
  
<EOS>
Florence
be
sit
on
a
certain
time
by
his
window
,
with
her
work
-
basket
between
her
and
her
old
attendant
,
who
be
still
her
faithful
companion
.
<EOS>
He
have
fall
into
a
doze
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
beautiful
evening
,
with
two
hour
of
light
to
come
yet
;
and
the
tranquillity
and
quiet
make
Florence
very
thoughtful
.
<EOS>
She
be
lose
to
everything
for
the
moment
,
but
the
occasion
when
the
so
alter
figure
on
the
bed
have
first
present
her
to
her
beautiful

;
when
a
touch
from
Walter

on
the

"
My

She
fancy
Walter

ask
him
if
anything
have
happen

<EOS>
"
no

I

Will
you
come

"
  
<EOS>
Florence
put
her
arm
through
his
;
and
confide
her
father
to
the
black
-
eyed
Mrs
Toots
,
who
sit
as
brisk
and
smart
at
her
work
as
black

accompany
her

<EOS>
in

pleasant
little

advance
towards
her

she
come
in

but
turn
off
,
by
reason
of
some
peculiarity
in
his
leg

by
the
table

<EOS>
Florence
then
remember
Cousin
Feenix

whom
she
have
not
at
first
recognise
in
the
shade
of
the
leave

<EOS>
Cousin

"
I

Cousin
Feenix

sit
down
as
Florence
sit

to
have
have
an
early
opportunity
of
offer
my
congratulation

in

<EOS>
the
only
description
of
society
I
have
keep
,
have
be
my

it
certainly
be
anything

flattering

good

so

many

have
a
feverish

I
be
about

when
a

have
leave
to
let
off
any
little

it
be
always
consider
a

have
the
happiness

believe
that
his

that

rise
quietly

they
be
talk

gravely

Florence
could
not

wonder
what
the
topic
be

that
have
make
them
so
well
acquainted
in
so
short
a

She
do
not
wonder
at
the
look

her

amble

that
my

excuse
my

a
little
stratagem

effect
this

<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
I
be
,
at
first
,
wholly
incredulous
as
to
the
possibility
of
my
lovely
and
accomplished
relative
having
,
very
unfortunately
,
commit
herself
with
the
deceased
person
with
white
tooth
;
because
,
in
point
of
fact
,
one
do
see
,
in
this
world
---
which
be
remarkable
for
devilish
strange
arrangement
,
and
for
be
decidedly
the
most
unintelligible
thing
within
a
man
's
experience
---
very
odd
conjunction
of
that
sort

<EOS>
but
as
I
mention
to
my
friend
Dombey

I
could
not
admit
the
criminality
of
my
lovely
and
accomplished
relative
until
it
be
perfectly
establish
.
<EOS>
and
feeling
,
when
the
deceased
person
be
,
in
point
of
fact
,
destroy
in
a
devilish
horrible
manner
,
that
her
position
be
a
very
painful
one
---
and
feeling
besides
that
our
family
have
be
a
little
to
blame
in
not
pay
more
attention
to
her
,
and
that
we
be
a
careless
family

and
also
that
my
aunt
,
though
a
devilish
lively
woman
,
have
perhaps
not
be
the
very
good
of
mother
<EOS>
---
I
take
the
liberty
of
seek
her
in
France
,
and
offer
her
such
protection
as
a
man
very
much
out
at
elbow
could
offer
.
<EOS>
upon
which
occasion
,
my
lovely
and
accomplished
relative
do
me
the
honour
to
express
that
she
believe
I
be
,
in
my
way
,
a
devilish
good
sort
of
fellow
;
and
that
therefore
she
put
herself
under
my
protection
.
<EOS>
which
in
point
of
fact
I
understand
to
be
a
kind
thing
on
the
part
of
my
lovely
and
accomplished
relative
,
as
I
be
get
extremely
shaky
,
and
have
derive
great
comfort
from
her
solicitude

<EOS>
Edith
,
who
have
take
Florence
to

sofa

make
a
gesture
with

would
have
beg
him
to
say
no
more

<EOS>
"
My
lovely
and
accomplished
relative

"
resume
Cousin
Feenix
,
still
amble
about
at
the
door
,
"
will
excuse
me
,
if
,
for
her
satisfaction
,
and
my
own
,
and
that
of
my
friend
Dombey
,
whose
lovely
and
accomplished
daughter
we
so
much
admire
,
I
complete
the
thread
of
my
observation
.
<EOS>
She
will
remember
that
,
from
the
first
,
she
and
I
have
never
allude
to
the
subject
of
her
elopement
.
<EOS>
My
impression
,
certainly
,
have
always
be
,
that
there
be
a
mystery
in
the
affair
which
she
could
explain
if
so
inclined
.
<EOS>
but
my
lovely
and
accomplished
relative
be
a
devilish
resolute
woman
,
I
know
that
she
be
not
,
in
point
of
fact
,
to
be
trifle
with
,
and
therefore
do
not
involve
myself
in
any
discussion
,
but
observe
lately
,
that
her
accessible
point
do
appear
to
be
a
very
strong
description
of
tenderness
for
the
daughter
of
my
friend
Dombey
<EOS>
,
it
occur
to
me
that
if
I
could
bring
about
a
meeting
,
unexpected
on
both
side
,
it
may
lead
to
beneficial
result
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
we
be
in
London
,
in
the
present
private
way
,
before
go
to
the
South
of
Italy
,
there
to
establish
ourselves
,
in
point
of
fact
,
until
we
go
to
our
long
home
,
which
be
a
devilish
disagreeable
reflection
for
a
man
,
I
apply
myself
to
the
discovery
of
the
residence
of
my
friend
Gay
---
handsome
man
of
an
uncommonly
frank
disposition
,
who
be
probably
known
to
my
lovely
and
accomplished
relative

and
have
the
happiness
of
bring
his
amiable
wife
to
the
present
place

<EOS>

now

say
Cousin
Feenix
,
with
a
real
and
genuine
earnestness
shine
through
the
levity
of
his
manner
and
his
slipshod
speech
,
<EOS>
"
I
do
conjure
my
relative
,
not
to
stop
half
way
,
but
to
set
right
,
as
far
as
she
can
,
whatever
she
have
do
wrong
---
not
for
the
honour
of
her
family

not
for
her

not

any
of
those
consideration
which
unfortunate
circumstance
have
induce
her
to
regard
as
hollow

in

of
fact

as
approach

humbug

not
right

in

<EOS>
autumn

if

look
up
in
his
face
,
ask
him
question
,
he
take
the
tiny
hand
in
his

hold
it

forget

<EOS>
then
the
child
say

so
they
range
away
again

busily
,
for
the
white

haired
gentleman
like
best
to
see
the
child
free
and
stirring
;
and
as
they
go
about
together
,
the
story
of
the
bond
between

go
about

follow
them

no

Florence

that

<EOS>
the

almost
wonder
at

secrecy
he
keep
in
it

<EOS>
He
hoard
her
in
his
heart

<EOS>
He
can
not
bear
to
see
a
cloud
upon
her
face
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
bear
to
see
her
sit
apart

<EOS>
He
fancy
that
she
feel

<EOS>
He
steal
away
to
look
at
her

in

<EOS>
It

him
to
have
her
come

and
wake
him
in
the
morning

<EOS>
He
be
fond
of
her
and
most
loving
to
her
,
when
there
be
no
creature
by

<EOS>
the
child

then
,
sometimes
:
  
"
dear
grandpapa

why
do
you
cry
when
you
kiss
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
only
answer
,
"
Little
Florence

<EOS>
little
Florence
