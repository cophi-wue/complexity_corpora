<EOS>
in
fashion
 
It
be
but
a
glimpse
of
the
world
of
fashion
that
we
want
on
this
same
miry
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
so
unlike
the
Court
of
Chancery
but
<EOS>
that
we
may
pass
from
the
one
scene
to
the
other
,
as
the
crow
fly
.
 
<EOS>
both
the
world
of
fashion
and
the
Court
of
Chancery
be
thing
of
precedent
and
usage
:
oversleep
Rip
Van
Winkles
who
have
play
at
strange
game
through
a
deal
of
thundery
weather
;
sleep
beauty
whom
the
knight
will
wake
one
day
,
when
all
the
stop
spit
in
the
kitchen
shall
begin
to
turn
prodigiously
!
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
large
world
.
 
<EOS>
relatively
even
to
this
world
of
our
,
which
have
its
limit
too
(
as
your
Highness
shall
find
when
you
have
make
the
tour
of
it
and
be
come
to
the
brink
of
the
void
beyond
)
,
it
be
a
very
little
speck
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
much
good
in
it
;
there
be
many
good
and
true
people
in
it
;
it
have
its
appoint
place
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
evil
of
it
be
that
it
be
a
world
wrap
up
in
too
much
jeweller
's
cotton
and
fine
wool
,
and
can
not
hear
the
rushing
of
the
large
world
,
and
can
not
see
them
as
they
circle
round
the
sun
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
deadened
world
,
and
its
growth
be
sometimes
unhealthy

of

My

the

say
so
for
the
comfort
of
the
Parisians

and
it
know
all
fashionable

<EOS>
to
know
thing
otherwise
be
to

<EOS>
My

Dedlock

in

with
melancholy
tree
for

in
it
and
a

puncture
all

all
day

with
fall
rain
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lady
Dedlock
's
place
have
be
extremely
dreary
.
 
<EOS>
the
weather
for
many
a
day
and
night
have
be
so
wet
that
the
tree
seem
wet
through
,
and
the
soft
lopping
and
pruning
of
the
woodman

axe
can
make

tardy
little
cloud
towards
the
green
rise

coppice

that
make
a
background
for
the
fall
rain

<EOS>
the
view
from
my
Lady
Dedlock
's
own
window
be
alternately
a
lead

<EOS>
the

upon

<EOS>
on
Sundays
the
little
church
in
the
park
be
mouldy
;
the
oaken
pulpit
break
out
into
a
cold
sweat
;
and
there
be
a
general
smell
and
taste
as
of
the
ancient
dedlock
in
their
grave
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lady
Dedlock
(
who
be
childless
)
,
look
out
in
the
early
twilight
from
her
boudoir
at
a
keeper
's
lodge
and
see
the
light
of
a
fire
upon
the
latticed
pane
,
and
smoke
rise
from
the
chimney
,
and
a
child

chase

run
out

to
meet
the
shine
figure
of
a

be
put
quite
out

temper

<EOS>
My
Lady
Dedlock
say
she
have
be
"
bore

death

"
   
<EOS>
therefore
my
Lady
Dedlock
have
come
away
from
the
place
in
Lincolnshire
and
have
leave
it
to
the
rain
,
and
the
crow
,
and
the
rabbit
,
and
the
deer
,
and
the
partridge
and
pheasant
.
 
<EOS>
the
picture
of
the
Dedlocks
past
and
go
have
seem
to
vanish
into
the
damp
wall
in
mere
lowness
of
spirit
,
as
the
housekeeper
have
pass
along
the
old
room
shut
up
the
shutter
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
they
will
next
come
forth
again
,
the
fashionable
intelligence
---
which
,
like
the
fiend
,
be
omniscient
of
the
past
and
present
,
but
not
the
future
---
can
not
yet
undertake
to
say
.
   
<EOS>
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
be
only
a
baronet
,
but
there
be
no
mightier
baronet
than
he
.
 
<EOS>
His
family
be
as
old
as
the
hill
,
and
infinitely
more
respectable
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
general
opinion
that
the
world
may
get
on
without
hill
but
would
be
do
up
without
Dedlocks
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
on
the
whole
admit
nature
to
be
a
good
idea
(
a
little
low
,
perhaps
,
when
not
enclose
with
a
park
-
fence
)
,
but
an
idea
dependent
for
its
execution
on
your
great
county
family
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
gentleman
of
strict
conscience
,
disdainful
of
all
littleness
and
meanness
and
ready
on
the
short
notice
to
die
any
death
you
may
please
to
mention
rather
than
give
occasion
for
the
least
impeachment
of
his
integrity
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
an
honourable
,
obstinate
,
truthful
,
high
-
spirited
,
intensely
prejudice
,
perfectly
unreasonable
man
.
   
<EOS>
Sir
Leicester
be
twenty
year
,
full
measure
,
old
than
my
Lady
.
<EOS>
He
will
never
see
sixty
-
five
again
,
nor
perhaps
sixty
-
six
,
nor
yet
sixty
-
seven
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
twist
of
the
gout
now
and
then
and
walk
a
little
stiffly
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
of
a
worthy
presence
,
with
his
light
-
grey
hair
and
whisker
,
his
fine
shirt
-
frill
,
his
pure
-
white
waistcoat
,
and
his
blue
coat
with
bright
button
always
button
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
ceremonious
,
stately
,
most
polite
on
every
occasion
to
my
Lady
,
and
hold
her
personal
attraction
in
the
high
estimation
.
 
<EOS>
His
gallantry
to
my
Lady
,
which
have
never
change
since
he
court
her
,
be
the
one
little
touch
of
romantic
fancy
in
him
.
   
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
marry
her
for
love
.
 
<EOS>
a
whisper
still
go
about
that
she
have
not
even
family
;
howbeit
,
Sir
Leicester
have
so
much
family
that
perhaps
he
have
enough
and
could
dispense
with
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
have
beauty
,
pride
,
ambition
,
insolent
resolve
,
and
sense
enough
to
portion
out
a
legion
of
fine
lady
.
 
<EOS>
wealth
and
station
,
add
to
these
,
soon
float
her
upward
,
and
for
year
now
my
Lady
Dedlock
have
be
at
the
centre
of
the
fashionable
intelligence
and
at
the
top
of
the
fashionable
tree
.
   
<EOS>
how
Alexander

when
he

no
more
world

My

an
exhausted
composure

an
equanimity

She

She

<EOS>
She
have
a
fine
face
---
originally
of
a
character
that
would
be
rather
call
very
pretty
than
handsome

but
improve
into
classicality
by
the

of
her
fashionable
state

<EOS>
Her
figure

elegant
and
have

<EOS>
not

<EOS>
with

my

have
come
up

(

<EOS>
across

which

and
very
dismal

It

my

Dedlock
as

She

<EOS>
Sir

have
no

It

he

even

involve

<EOS>
a
Progress
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
begin
to
write
my
portion
of
these
page
,
for
I
know
I
be
not
clever
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
know
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
remember
,
when
I
be
a
very
little
girl
indeed
,
I
use
to
say
to
my
doll
when
we
be
alone
together
,
"
now
,
Dolly
,
I
be
not
clever
,
you
know
very
well
,
and
you
must
be
patient
with
me
,
like
a
dear
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
so
she
use
to
sit
prop
up
in
a
great
arm
-
chair
,
with
her
beautiful
complexion
and
rosy
lip
,
stare
at
me
---
or
not
so
much
at
me
,
I
think
,
as
at
nothing
---
while
I
busily
stitch
away
and
tell
her
every
one
of
my
secret
.
   
<EOS>
My
dear
old
doll
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
such
a
shy
little
thing
that
I
seldom
dare
to
open
my
lip
,
and
never
dare
to
open
my
heart
,
to
anybody
else
.
 
<EOS>
It
almost
make
me
cry
to
think
what
a
relief
it
use
to
be
to
me
when
I
come
home
from
school
of
a
day
to
run
upstairs
to
my
room
and
say
,
"
oh
,
you
dear
faithful
dolly
,
I
know
you
would
be
expect
me
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
to
sit
down
on
the
floor
,
lean
on
the
elbow
of
her
great
chair
,
and
tell
her
all
I
have
notice
since
we
part
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
always
rather
a
notice
way
---
not
a
quick
way
,
<EOS>
oh
,
no
!
---
a
silent
way
of
notice
what
pass
before
me
and
think
I
should
like
to
understand
it
better
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
by
any
mean
a
quick
understanding
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
love
a
person
very
tenderly
indeed
,
it
seem
to
brighten
.
 
<EOS>
but
even
that
may
be
my
vanity
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
bring
up
,
from
my
early
remembrance
---
like
some
of
the
princess
in
the
fairy
story
,
only
I
be
not
charming
---
by
my
godmother
.
 
<EOS>
at
least
,
I
only
know
her
as
such
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
good
,
good
woman
!
 
<EOS>
She
go
to
church
three
time
every
Sunday
,
and
to
morning
prayer
on
Wednesdays
and
Fridays
,
and
to
lecture
whenever
there
be
lecture
;
and
never
miss
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
handsome
;
and
if
she
have
ever
smile
,
would
have
be
<EOS>
(
I
use
to
think
)
like
an
angel
---
but
she
never
smile
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
always
grave
and
strict
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
so
very
good
herself
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
that
the
badness
of
other
people
make
her
frown
all
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
so
different
from
her
,
even
make
every
allowance
for
the
difference
between
a
child
and
a
woman
;
I
feel
so
poor
,
so
trifling
,
and
so
far
off
that
I
never
could
be
unrestrained
with
her
---
<EOS>
no
,
could
never
even
love
her
as
I
wish
.
 
<EOS>
It
make
me
very
sorry
to
consider
how
good
she
be
and
how
unworthy
of
her
<EOS>
I
be
,
and
I
use
ardently
to
hope
that
I
may
have
a
well
heart
;
and
I
talk
it
over
very
often
with
the
dear
old
doll
,
but
I
never
love
my
godmother
as
I
ought
to
have
love
her
<EOS>
and
as
I
feel
I
must
have
love
her
if
I
have
be
a
well
girl
.
   
<EOS>
this
make
me
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
more
timid
and
retire
than
I
naturally
be
and
cast
me
upon
Dolly
as
the
only
friend
with
whom
I
feel
at
ease
.
 
<EOS>
but
something
happen
when
I
be
still
quite
a
little
thing
that
help
it
very
much
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
never
hear
my
mama
speak
of
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
hear
of
my
papa
either
,
but
I
feel
more
interested
about
my
mama
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
wear
a
black
frock
,
that
I
could
recollect
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
be
show
my
mama
's
grave
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
be
tell
where
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
yet
I
have
never
be
teach
to
pray
for
any
relation
but
my
godmother
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
more
than
once
approach
this
subject
of
my
thought
with
Mrs
Rachael
,
our
only
servant
,
who
take
my
light
away
when
I
be
in

another
very
good

austere
to
me

and
she
have
only
say

go
away

be
the
young
there
by
a
good
deal
)
,
but
there
seem
to
be
some
other
separation
between
us
besides
that
,
and
besides
their
be
far
more
clever
than
I
be
and
know
much
more
than
I
do

<EOS>
one
of
them
in
the
first
week
of
my
go
to
the
school
<EOS>
(
I
remember
it
very
well
)
invite
me
home
to
a
little
party
,
to
my
great
joy
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
godmother
write
a
stiff
letter
decline
for
me
,
and
I
never
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
go
out
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
my
birthday
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
holiday
at
school
on
other
birthday
---
none
on
mine
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
rejoicing
at
home
on
other
birthday
,
as
I
know
from
what
I
hear
the
girl
relate
to
one
another
---
there
be
none
on
mine
.
 
<EOS>
My
birthday
be
the
most
melancholy
day
at
home
in
the
whole
year
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
mention
that
unless
my
vanity
should
deceive
me
(
as
I
know
it
may
,
for
I
may
be
very
vain
without
suspect
it
,
though
indeed
I
do
not
)
,
my
comprehension
be
quicken
when
my
affection
be
.
 
<EOS>
My
disposition
be
very
affectionate
,
and
perhaps
I
may
still
feel
such
a
wound
if
such
a
wound
could
be
receive
more
than
once
with
the
quickness
of
that
birthday
.
   
<EOS>
dinner
be
over
,
and
my
godmother
and
I
be
sit
at
the
table
before
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
the
clock
tick
,
the
fire
click
;
not
another
sound
have
be
hear
in
the
room
or
in
the
house
for
I
do
not
know
how
long
.
 
<EOS>
I
happen
to
look
timidly
up
from
my
stitching
,
across
the
table
at
my
godmother
,
and
I
see
in
her
face
,
look
gloomily
at
me
,
"
It
would
have
be
far
well
,
little
Esther
,
that
you
have
have
no
birthday
,
that
you
have
never
be
bear
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
break
out
cry
and
sob
,
and
I
say
,
"
oh
,
dear
godmother
,
tell
me
,
pray
<EOS>
do
tell
me
,
do
Mama
die
on

<EOS>
what
do
I
do
to
her
?
 
<EOS>
how
do
I
lose
her
?
 
<EOS>
why
be
I
so
different
from

and
why
be
it
my
fault

<EOS>
no

no

no

do
not
go
away

<EOS>
oh

speak
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
in
a
kind
of
fright
beyond
my
grief
,
and
I
catch
hold
of
her
dress
and
be
kneel
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
say
all
the
while
,
"
let
me
go
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
now
she
stand
still
.
   
<EOS>
Her
darken
face
have
such
power
over
me
that
it
stop
me
in
the
midst
of
my
vehemence
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
up
my
tremble
little
hand
to
clasp
her
or
to
beg
her
pardon
with
what
earnestness
I
may
,
but
withdraw
it
as
she
look
at
me
,
and
lay
it
on
my
flutter
heart
.
 
<EOS>
She
raise
me
,
sit
in
her
chair
,
and
stand
me
before
her
,
say
slowly
in
a
cold
,
low
voice
---
I
see
her
knit
brow
and
pointed
finger
---
"
Your
mother
,
Esther

be
your
disgrace

you
be
hers

the
time
will
come

soon
enough

when
you
will
understand
this
better

will
feel
it

as
no

<EOS>
I
have
forgive
her

but
her
face
do
not
relent

"
the
wrong
she
do
to
me

and
<EOS>
I

no

of
it

it
be
great

for

unfortunate

pray
daily

<EOS>
She
check
me
,
however
,
as
I
be
about
to
depart
from
her

so
frozen
as

add
this

"
   
<EOS>
I
go
up
to
my
room
,
and
creep
to
bed
,
and
lay
my
doll
's
cheek
against
mine
wet
with
tear
,
and
hold
that
solitary
friend
upon
my
bosom
,
cry
myself
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
Imperfect
<EOS>
as
my
understanding
of
my
sorrow
be

I
know
that
I
have
bring
no
joy
at
any

to
anybody
's
heart

that
I
be
to
no
one
upon
earth
what
Dolly
be
to
me

<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
,
to
think
how
much
time
we
pass
alone
together
afterwards
,
and
how
often
I
repeat
to
the
doll
the
story
of
my
birthday
and
confide
to
her
that
I
would
try
as
hard
as
ever
<EOS>
I
could
to
repair
the
fault
I
have
be
bear
with
(
of
which
I
confessedly
feel
guilty
and
yet
innocent
)
and
would
strive
as
I
grow
up
to
be
industrious
,
contented
,
and
kind
-
hearted
and
to
do
some
good
to
some
one
,
and
win
some
love
to
myself
if
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
be
not
self
-
indulgent
to
shed
these
tear
as
I
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
thankful
,
I
be
very
cheerful
,

I
can
not
quite
help
their
come
to
my
eye
.
   
<EOS>
there
!
<EOS>
I
have
wipe
them
away
now
and
can
go
on
again
properly
.
   
<EOS>
I
feel
the
distance
between
my
godmother
and
myself
so
much
more
after
the
birthday
,
and
feel
so
sensible
of
fill
a
place
in
her
house
which
ought
to
have
be
empty
,
that
I
find
her
more
difficult
of
approach
,
though
I
be
fervently
grateful
to
her
in
my
heart
,
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
in
the
same
way
towards
my
school
companion
;
I
feel
in
the

way
towards
Mrs
Rachael
,
who
be
a
widow
;

towards
her
daughter
,
of
whom
she
be
proud

who
come
to
see
her
once
a
fortnight
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
retired
and
quiet
,
and
try
to
be
very
diligent
.
   
<EOS>
one
sunny
afternoon
when
I
have
come
home
from
school
with
my
book

watch
my
long

<EOS>
the

put
up
his
eye

"
 
<EOS>
He

<EOS>
and
then
,
take

It

say
Mr
Kenge
,
lean
back
in
his
chair
again
and
look
calmly
at
us
both
.
   
<EOS>
He
appear
to
enjoy
beyond
everything
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
wonder
at
that
,
for
it
be
mellow
and
full
and
give
great
importance
to
every
word
he
utter
.
 
<EOS>
He
listen
to
himself
with
obvious
satisfaction
and
sometimes
gently
beat
time
to
his
own
music
with
his
head
or
round
a
sentence
with
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
impress
by
him

even
then
,
before
I
know
that
he
form
himself
on

<EOS>
My

be
fill
so
full
,
both
by
what

by
his

I

<EOS>

take
time

"
   
<EOS>
what
the
destitute
subject
of
such
an
offer
try
to
say
,
I
need
not
repeat
.
 
<EOS>
what
she
do
say
,
I
could
more
easily
tell
,
if
it
be
worth
the
telling
.
 
<EOS>
what
she
feel
,
and
will
feel
to
her
die

I
could
never

<EOS>
this
interview
take
place
at
Windsor
,
where
I
have
pass
(
as
far
as
I
know

<EOS>
my
whole
life

<EOS>
on
that
day

amply
provide
with
all

inside

for
Reading

<EOS>
Mrs
Rachael
be
too
good
to
feel
any
emotion
at
parting
,
but
I
be
not
so
good
,
and
weep
bitterly
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
that
I
ought
to
have
know
her
well
after
so
many
year
and
ought
to
have
make
myself
enough
of
a
favourite
with
her
to
make
her
sorry
then
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
give
me
one
cold
parting
kiss
upon
my
forehead
,
like
a
thaw
-
drop
from
the
stone
porch
---
it
be
a
very
frosty
day
---
<EOS>
I
feel
so
miserable
and
self
-
reproachful
that
I
cling
to
her
and
<EOS>
tell
her
it
be
my
fault
,
I
know
,
that
she
could
say
good
-
bye
so
easily
!

no

It

<EOS>
the
coach
be
at
the
little
lawn
-
gate
---
we
have
not
come
out
until
we
hear
the
wheel
---
and
thus
I
leave
her
,
with
a
sorrowful
heart
.
 
<EOS>
She
go
in
before
my
box
be
lift
to
the
coach
-
roof
and
shut
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
as
long
as
I
could
see
the
house
,
I
look
back
at
it
from
the
window
through
my
tear
.
 
<EOS>
My
godmother
have
leave
Mrs
Rachael
all
the
little
property
she
possess
;
and
there
be
to
be
a
sale
;
and
an
old
hearth
-
rug
with
rose
on
it
,
which
always
seem
to
me
the
first
thing
in
the
world
I
have
ever
see
,
be
hang
outside
in
the
frost
and
snow
.
 
<EOS>
a
day
or
two
before
,
I
have
wrap
the
dear
old
doll
in
her
own
shawl
and
quietly
lay
her
<EOS>
---
I
be
half
ashamed
to
tell
it
---
in
the
garden
-
earth
under
the
tree
that
shade
my
old
window
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
companion
leave
but
my
bird
,
and
him
<EOS>
I
carry
with
me
in
his
cage
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
house
be
out
of
sight
,
I
sit
,
with
my
bird
-
cage
in
the
straw
at
my
foot
,
forward
on
the
low
seat
to
look
out
of
the
high
window
,
watch
the
frosty
tree
,
that
be
like
beautiful
piece
of
spar
,
and
the
field
all
smooth
and
white
with
last
night
's
snow
,
and
the
sun
,
so
red
but
yielding
so
little
heat
,
and
the
ice
,
dark
like
metal
where
the
skater
and
slider
have
brush
the
snow
away
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
gentleman
in
the
coach
who
sit
on
the
opposite
seat
and
look
very
large
in
a
quantity
of
wrapping
,
but
he
sit
gaze
out
of
the
other
window
and
take
no
notice
of
me
.
   
<EOS>
I
think
of
my
dead
godmother
,
of
the
night
when
I
read
to
her
,
of
her
frown
so
fixedly
and
sternly
in
her
bed
,
of
the
strange
place
I
be
go
to
,
of
the
people
I
should
find
there
,
and
what
they
would
be
like
,
and
what
they
would
say
to
me
,
when
a
voice
in
the
coach
give
me
a
terrible
start
.
   
<EOS>
It
say
,
"
what
the
de
-
vil
be
you
cry
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
so
frightened
that
I
lose
my
voice
and
could
only
answer
in
a
whisper
,
"
Me
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
for
of
course
I
know
it
must
have
be
the
gentleman
in
the
quantity
of
wrapping
,
though
he
be
still
look
out
of
his
window
.
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
you
,
"
he
say
,
turn
round
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
I
be
cry
,
sir
,
<EOS>
"
I
falter
.
   
<EOS>
"
but
you
be
!
"
say
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
look
here
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
come
quite
opposite
to
me
from
the
other
corner
of
the
coach
,
brush
one
of
his
large
furry
cuff
across
my
eye
(
<EOS>
but
without
hurt
me
)
,
and
show
me
that
it
be
wet
.
   
<EOS>
"
there
!
 
<EOS>
now
you
know
you
be
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
"
I
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
and
what
be
you
cry
for
?
"
say
the
genfleman
,
"
do
not
you
want
to
go
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
where
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
where
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
wherever
you
be
go
,
"
say
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
to
go
there
,
sir
,
"
I
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
then
!
 
<EOS>
look
glad
!
"
say
the
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
I
think
he
be
very
strange
,
or
at
least
that
what
I
could
see
of
him
be
very
strange
,
for
he
be
wrap
up
to
the
chin
,
and
his
face
be
almost
hide
in
a
fur
cap
with
broad
fur
strap
at
the
side
of
his
head
<EOS>
fasten
under
his
chin
;
but
I
be
compose
again
,
and
not
afraid
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
tell
him
that
I
think
I
must
have
be
cry
because
of
my
godmother
's
death
and
because
of
Mrs
Rachael
's
not
be
sorry
to
part
with
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Confound
Mrs
Rachael
!
"
say
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
her
fly
away
in
a
high
wind
on
a
broomstick
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
begin
to
be
really
afraid
of
him
now
and
look
at
him
with
the
great
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
think
that
he
have
pleasant
eye
,
although
he
keep
on
mutter
to
himself
in
an
angry
manner
and
call
Mrs
Rachael
name
.
   
<EOS>
after
a
little
while
he
open
his
outer
wrapper
,
which
appear
to
me
large
enough
to
wrap
up
the
whole
coach
,
and
put
his
arm
down
into
a
deep
pocket
in
the
side
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
look
here
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
in
this
paper
,

which

thick

<EOS>
here

(
a
gem
<EOS>
this
be
,
both
for
size
and
quality

in
France

<EOS>
and
what
do
you
suppose
it
be
make
of
?
<EOS>
liver
of
fat
geese
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
pie
!
 
<EOS>
now
let
's
see
you
eat

em
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
sir
,
"
I
reply
;
"
thank
you
very
much
indeed
,
but
I
hope
you
will
not
be
offend

they
be
too
rich
for

"
   
<EOS>
"
floor
again
!
"
<EOS>
say
the
gentleman
,
which
I
do
not
at
all
understand
,
and
throw
them
both
out
of
window
.
   
<EOS>
He
do
not
speak
to
me
any
more
until
he
get
out
of
the
coach
a
little
way
short
of
Reading
,
when
he
advise
me
to
be
a
good
girl
and
to
be
studious
,
and
shake
hand
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
say
I
be
relieve
by
his
departure
.
 
<EOS>
We
leave
him
at
a
milestone
.
 
<EOS>
I
often
walk
past
it
afterwards
,
and
never
for
a
long
time
without
think
of
him
and
half
expect
to
meet
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
never
do
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
as
time
go
on
,
he
pass
out
of
my
mind
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
coach
stop
,
a
very
neat
lady
look
up
at
the
window
and
say
,
"
Miss
Donny
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
madam
,
Esther
Summerson
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
quite
right
,
"
say
the
lady
,
"
Miss
Donny
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
now
understand
that
she
introduce
herself
by
that
name
,
and
beg
Miss
Donny
's
pardon
for
my
mistake
,
and
point
out
my
box
at
her
request
.
 
<EOS>
under
the
direction
of
a
very
neat
maid
,
they
be
put
outside
a
very
small
green
carriage
;
and
then
Miss
Donny
,
the
maid
,
and
I
get
inside
and
be
drive
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
everything
be
ready
for
you
,
Esther
,
"
say
Miss
Donny
,
"
and
the
scheme
of
your
pursuit
have
be
arrange
in
exact
accordance

<EOS>
"
of

say
Miss

<EOS>
I
be
so
bewilder
that
Miss
Donny
think
the
cold
have
be
too
severe
for
me
and
lend
me
her
smelling

bottle
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
know

I
ask
after
a
good
deal
of
hesitation
.
   
<EOS>
"
not
personally
,
Esther
,
"
say
Miss
Donny
;
"
merely
through
his
solicitor
,
Messrs.
Kenge
and
Carboy
,
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
a
very
superior
gentleman
,
Mr
Kenge
.
 
<EOS>
truly
eloquent
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
his
period
quite
majestic
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
feel
this
to
be
very
true
but
be
too
confused
to
attend
to
it
.
<EOS>
Our
speedy
arrival
at
our
destination
,
before
I
have
time
to
recover
myself
,
increase
my
confusion
,
and
I
never
shall
forget
the
uncertain
and
the
unreal
air
of
everything
at
Greenleaf
<EOS>
(
Miss
Donny
's
house
)
<EOS>
that
afternoon
!
   
<EOS>
but
I
soon
become
used
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
adapt
to
the
routine
of
Greenleaf
before
long
<EOS>
that
I
seem
to
have
be
there
a
great
while
and
almost
to
have
dream
rather
than
really
live
my
old
life
at
my
godmother
's
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
precise
,
exact
,
and
orderly
than
Greenleaf
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
time
for
everything
all
round
the
dial
of
the
clock
,
and
everything
be
do
at
its
appointed
moment
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
twelve
boarder
,
and
there
be
two
Miss
Donnys
,
twin
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
understand
that
I
would
have
to
depend
,
by
and
by
,
on
my
qualification
as
a
governess
,
and
I
be
not
only
instruct
in
everything
that
be
teach
at
Greenleaf
,
but
be
very
soon
engage
in
help
to
instruct
other
.
 
<EOS>
although
I
be
treat
in
every
other
respect
like
the
rest
of
the
school
,
this
single
difference
be
make
in
my
case
from
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
begin
to
know
more
,
I
teach
more
,
and
so
in
course
of
time
I
have
plenty
to
do
,
which
I
be
very
fond
of
do
because
it
make
the
dear
girl
fond
of
me
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
whenever
a
new
pupil
come
who
be
a
little
downcast
and
unhappy
,
she
be
so
sure
---
<EOS>
indeed
I
do
not
know
why
---
to
make
a
friend
of
me
that
all
new
-
comer
be
confide
to
my
care
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
I
be
so
gentle
,
but
I
be
sure
they
be
!
 
<EOS>
I
often
think
of
the
resolution
I
have
make
on
my
birthday
to
try
to
be
industrious
,
contented
,
and
true
-
hearted
and
to
do
some
good
to
some
one
and
win
some
love
if
I
could
;
and
indeed
,
indeed
,
I
feel
almost
ashamed
to
have
do
so
little
and
have
win
so
much
.
   
<EOS>
I
pass
at
Greenleaf
six
happy
,
quiet
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
in
any
face
there
,
thank
heaven
,
on
my
birthday
,
that
it
would
have
be
well
if
I
have
never
be
bear
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
day
come
round
,
it
bring
me
so
many
token
of
affectionate
remembrance
that
my
room
be
beautiful
with
them
from
New
Year
's
day
to
Christmas
.
   
<EOS>
in
those
six
year
I
have
never
be
away
except
on
visit
at
holiday
time
in
the
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
after
the
first
six
month
or
so
I
have
take
Miss
Donny
's
advice
in
reference
to
the
propriety
of
write
to
Mr
Kenge
to
say
that
I
be
happy
and
grateful
,
and
with
her
approval
I
have
write
such
a
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
receive
a
formal
answer
acknowledge
its
receipt
and
say
,
"
We
note
the
content
thereof
,
which
shall
be
duly
communicate
to
our
client
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
after
that
I
sometimes
hear
<EOS>
Miss
Donny
and
her
sister
mention
how
regular
my
account
be
pay
,
and
about
twice
a
year
I
venture
to
write
a
similar
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
receive
by
return
of
post
exactly
the
same
answer
in
the
same
round
hand
,
with
the
signature
of
Kenge
and
Carboy
in
another
writing
,
which
I
suppose
to
be
Mr
Kenge
's
.
   
<EOS>
It
seem
so
curious
to
me
to
be
oblige
to
write
all
this
about
myself
!
 
<EOS>
as
if
this
narrative
be
the
narrative
of
my
life
!
 
<EOS>
but
my
little
body
will
soon
fall
into
the
background
now
.

It

it

so
gracious
in
that

I
be

but
the
pleasure
of

,
and
the
pain
of
it
,
and
the
pride
and
joy
of
it
,
and
the
humble
regret
of
it
be
so
blended
that
my
heart
seem
almost
breaking
while
it
be
full
of
rapture
.
   
<EOS>
the
letter
give
me
only
five
day

<EOS>
when
every
minute
add
to
the
proof
of
love
and
kindness
that
be
give
me
in
those
five
day
,
and
when
at
last
the
morning
come
and
when
they
take
me
through
all
the
room
that
I
may
see
them
for
the
last
time
,
and
when
some
cry
,
"
esther
,

,
say
good
-
bye
to
me
here
at
my
bedside
,
where
you
first
speak
so
kindly
to
me
!
"
<EOS>
and
when
other
ask
me
only
to
write
their
name
,
"
with
Esther
's
love
,
"
and
when
they
all
surround
me
with
their
parting
present
and
clung
to
me
weep
and
cry
,
"
what
shall
we
do
when
dear
,
dear
<EOS>
Esther
be
go
!
"
<EOS>
and
when
I
try
to
tell
them
how
forbear
and
how
good
they
have
all
be
to
me
and
how
I
bless
and
thank
them
every
one
,
<EOS>
what
a
heart
I
have
!
   
<EOS>
and
when
the
two
Miss
Donnys
grieve
as
much
to
part
with
me
as
the
least
among
them
,
and
when
the
maid
say
,
"
bless
you
,
miss
,
wherever
you
go
!
"
<EOS>
and
when
the
ugly
lame
old
gardener
,
who
I
think
have
hardly
notice
me
in
all
those
year
,
come
pant
after
the
coach
to
give
me
a
little
nosegay
of
geranium
and
tell
me
I
have
be
the
light
of
his
eye
---
indeed
the
old
man
say
so
!
<EOS>
---
 
<EOS>
what
a
heart
<EOS>
I
have
then
!
   
<EOS>
and
could
I
help
it
if
with
all
this
,
and
the
come
to
the
little
school
,
and
the
unexpected
sight
of
the
poor
child
outside
wave
their
hat
and
bonnet
to
me
,
and
of
a
grey
-
haired
gentleman
and
lady
whose
daughter
I
have
help
to
teach
and
at
whose
house
I
have
visit
(
who
be
say
to
be
the
proud
people
in
all
that
country
)
,
care
for
nothing
but
call
out
,
"
good
-
bye
,
Esther
.
<EOS>
May
you
be
very
happy
!
"
<EOS>
---
could
I
help
it
if
I
be
quite
bow
down
in
the
coach
by
myself
and
say
"
<EOS>
oh
,
I
be
so
thankful
,
I
be
so
thankful
!
"
<EOS>
many
time
over
!
   
<EOS>
but
of
course
I
soon
consider
that
I
must
not
take
tear
where
I
be
go
after
all
that
have
be
do
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
of
course
,
I
make
myself
sob
less
and
persuade
myself
to
be
quiet
by
say
very
often
,
"
esther
,
now
you
really
must
!
 
<EOS>
this
WILL
not
do
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
cheer
myself
up
pretty
well
at
last
,
though
I
be
afraid
I
be
long
about
it
than
I
ought
to
have
be
;
and
when
I
have
cool
my
eye
with
lavender
water
,
it
be
time
to
watch
for
London
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
quite
persuade
that
we
be
there
when
we
be
ten
mile
off
,
and
when
we
really
be
there
,
that
we
should
never
get
there
.
<EOS>
however
,
when
we
begin
to
jolt
upon
a
stone
pavement
,
and
particularly
when
every
other
conveyance
seem
to
be
run
into
us
,
and
we
seem
to
be
run
into
every
other
conveyance
,
I
begin
to
believe
that
we
really
be
approach
the
end
of
our
journey
.
 
<EOS>
very
soon
afterwards
we
stop
.
   
<EOS>
a
young
gentleman
who
have
ink
himself
by
accident
address
me
from
the
pavement
and
say
,
"
I
be
from
Kenge
and
Carboy
's
,
miss
,
of
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
if
you
please
,
sir
,
"
say
<EOS>
I.
   
He
be
very
obliging
,
and
as
he
hand
me
into
a
fly
after
superintend
the
removal
of
my
box
,
I
ask
him
whether
there
be
a
great
fire
anywhere
?
 
<EOS>
for
the
street
be
so
full
of
dense
brown
smoke
that
scarcely
anything
be
to
be
see
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
dear
no
,
miss
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
London
particular
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
have
never
hear
of
such
a
thing
.
   
<EOS>
"
a
fog
,
miss
,
"
say
the
young
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
indeed
!
"
say
I.
   
We
drive
slowly
through
the
dirty
and
darkest
street
that
ever
be
see
in
the
world
(
I
think
)
and
in
such
a
distracting
state
of
confusion
that
I
wonder
how
the
people
keep
their
sense
,
until
we
pass
into
sudden
quietude
under
an
old
gateway
and
drive
on
through
a
silent
square
until
we
come
to
an
odd
nook
in
a
corner
,
where
there
be
an
entrance
up
a
steep
,
broad
flight
of
stair
,
like
an
entrance
to
a
church
.
 
<EOS>
and
there
really
be
a
churchyard
outside
under
some
cloister
,
<EOS>
for
I
see
the
gravestone
from
the
staircase
window
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
Kenge
and
Carboy
's
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
show
me
through
an
outer
office
into
Mr
Kenge
's
room
---
there
be
no
one
in
it
---
and
politely
put
an
arm
-
chair
for
me
by
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
call
my
attention
to
a
little
looking
-
glass
hang
from
a
nail
on
one
side
of
the
chimney
-
piece
.
   
<EOS>
"
in
case
you
should
wish
to
look
at
yourself
,
miss
,
after
the
journey
,
as
you
be
go
before
the
Chancellor
.
 
<EOS>
not
that
it
be
requisite
,
I
be
sure
,
"
say
the
young
gentleman
civilly
.
   
<EOS>
"
go
before
the
Chancellor
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
startle
for
a
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
only
a
matter
of
form
,
miss
,
"
return
the
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Kenge
be
in
court
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
leave
his
compliment
,
and
would
you
partake
of
some
refreshment
"
<EOS>
---
there
be
biscuit
and
a
decanter
of
wine
on
a
small
table
---
"
and
look
over
the
paper
,
"
which
the
young
gentleman
give
me
as
he
speak
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
stir
the
fire
and
leave
me
.
   
<EOS>
everything
be
so
strange
---
the
stranger
from
its
be
night
in
the
day
-
time
,
the
candle
burn
with
a
white
flame
,
and
look
raw
and
cold
---
<EOS>
that
I
read
the
word
in
the
newspaper
without
know
what
they
mean
and
find
myself
read
the
same
word
repeatedly
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
of
no
use
go
on
in
that
way
,
I
put
the
paper
down
,
take
a
peep
at
my
bonnet
in
the
glass
to
see
if
it
be
neat
,
and
look
at
the
room
,
which
be
not
half
light
,
and
at
the
shabby
,
dusty
table
,
and
at
the
pile
of
writing
,
and
at
a
bookcase
full
of
the
most
inexpressive
-
look
book
that
ever
have
anything
to
say
for
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
go
on
,
think
,
think
,
think
;
and
the
fire
go
on
,
burn
,
burn
,
burn
;
and
the
candle
go
on
flickering
and
guttering
,
and
there
be
no
snuffer
---
until
the
young
gentleman
by
and
by
bring
a
very
dirty
pair
---
for
two
hour
.
   
<EOS>
at
last
Mr
Kenge
come
.
 
<EOS>
he
be
not
alter
,
but
he
be
surprised
to
see
how
altered
I
be
and
appear
quite
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
"
as
you
be
go
to
be
the
companion
of
the
young
lady
who
be
now
in
the
Chancellor
's
private
room
,
Miss
Summerson
,
"
he
say
,
"
we
think
it
well
that
you
should
be
in
attendance
also
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
not
be
discompose
by
the
Lord
Chancellor
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
,
"
I
say
,
"
I
do
not
think
I
shall
,
"
really
not
see
on
consideration
why
I
should
be
.
   
<EOS>
so
Mr
Kenge
give
me
his
arm
<EOS>
and
we
go
round
the
corner
,
under
a
colonnade
,
and
in
at
a
side
door
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
we
come
,
along
a
passage
,
into
a
comfortable
sort
of
room
where
a
young
lady
and
a
young
gentleman
be
stand
near
a
great
,
loud
-
roar
fire
.
 
<EOS>
a
screen
be
interpose
between
them
and
it
,
and
they
be
lean
on
the
screen
,
talk
.
   
<EOS>
They
both
look
up
when
I
come
in
,
and
I
see
in
the
young
lady
,
with
the
fire
shine
upon
her
,
such
a
beautiful
girl
!
 
<EOS>
with
such
rich
golden
hair
,
such
soft
blue
eye
,
and
such
a
bright
,
innocent
,
trust
face
!
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Ada
,
"
say
Mr
Kenge
,
"
this
be
Miss
Summerson
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
come
to
meet
me
with
a
smile
of
welcome
and
her
hand
extend
,
but
seem
to
change
her
mind
in
a
moment
and
kiss
me
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
she
have
such
a
natural
,
captivate
,
win
manner
that
in
a
few
minute
we
be
sit
in
the
window
-
seat
,
with
the
light
of
the
fire
upon
us
,
talk
together
as
free
and
happy
as
could
be
.
   
<EOS>
what
a
load
off
my
mind
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
delightful
to
know
that
she
could
confide
in
me
and
like
me
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
good
of
her
,
and
so
encouraging
to
me
!
   
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
be
her
distant
cousin
,
she
tell
me
,
and
his
name
Richard
Carstone
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
handsome
youth
with
an
ingenuous
face
and
a
most
engaging
laugh
;
and
after
she
have
call
him
up
to
where
we
sit
,
he
stand
by
us
,
in
the
light
of
the
fire
,
talk
gaily
,
like
a
light
-
hearted
boy
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
young
,
not
more
than
nineteen
then
,
if
quite
so
much
,
but
nearly
two
year
old
than
she
be
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
both
orphan
<EOS>
and
(
what
be
very
unexpected
and
curious
to
me
)
have
never
meet
before
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
Our
all
three
come
together
for
the
first
time
in
such
an
unusual
place
be
a
thing

We
converse
in
a
low
tone
because
a
full

dressed
gentleman
in
a
bag
wig
frequently
come
in

out
,
and
when
he
do
so

we
could
hear
a
drawl
sound

he
say

one
of

the

He
tell
Mr

of
foot
,

say
that
the
Court

He
seem
quite
delighted
with
it
on
my
account
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
fog
be
very
dense
indeed
!
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
not
that
it
affect
you
,
though
,
I
be
sure
,
"
say
Mr
Guppy
,
put
up
the
step
.
 
<EOS>
"
on
the
contrary
,
it
seem
to
do
you
good
,
miss
,
judge
from
your
appearance
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
know
he
mean
well
in
pay
me
this
compliment
,
so
I
laugh
at
myself
for
blush
at
it
when
he
have
shut
the
door
and
get
upon
the
box
;
and
we
all
three
laugh
and
chat
about
our
inexperience
and
the
strangeness
of
London
until
we
turn
up
under
an
archway
to
our
destination
---
a
narrow
street
of
high
house
like
an
oblong
cistern
to
hold
the
fog
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
confused
little
crowd
of
people
,
principally
child
,
gather
about
the
house
at
which
we
stop
,
which
have
a
tarnished
brass
plate
on
the
door
with
the
inscription
jellyby
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
be
frighten
!
"
say
Mr
Guppy
,
look
in
at
the
coach
-
window
.
 
<EOS>
"
one
of
the
young
Jellybys
be
and
get
his
head
through
the
area
railing
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
poor
child
,
"
say
I
;
"
let
me
out
,
if
you
please
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
pray
be
careful
of
yourself
,
miss
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
Jellybys
be
always
up
to
something
,
"
say
Mr
Guppy
.
   
<EOS>
I
make
my
way
to
the
poor
child
,
who
be
one
of
the
dirty
little
unfortunate
I
ever
see
,
and
find
him
very
hot
and
frightened
and
cry
loudly
,
fix
by
the
neck
between
two
iron
railing
,
while
a
milkman
and
a
beadle
,
with
the
kind
intention
possible
,
be
endeavour
to
drag
him
back
by
the
leg
,
under
a
general
impression
that
his
skull
be
compressible
by
those
mean
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
find
(
after
pacify
him
)
that
he
be
a
little
boy
with
a
naturally
large
head
,
I
think
that
perhaps
where
his
head
could
go
,
his
body
could
follow
,
and
mention
that
the
good
mode
of
extrication
may
be
to
push
him
forward
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
so
favourably
receive
by
the
milkman
and
beadle
that
he
would
immediately
have
be
push
into
the
area
if
I
have
not
hold
his
pinafore
while
Richard
and
Mr
Guppy
run
down
through
the
kitchen
to
catch
him
when
he
should
be
release
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
he
be
happily
get
down
without
any
accident
,
and
then
he
begin
to
beat
Mr
Guppy
with
a
hoop
-
stick
in
quite
a
frantic
manner
.
   
<EOS>
nobody
have
appear
belong
to
the
house
except
a
person
in
patten
,
who
have
be
poke
at
the
child
from
below
with
a
broom
;
I
do
not
know
with
what
object
,
and
I
do
not
think
she
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
suppose
that
Mrs
Jellyby
be
not
at
home
,
and
be
quite
surprised
when
the
person
appear
in
the
passage
without
the
patten
,
and
go
up
to
the
back
room
on
the
first
floor
before
Ada
and
me
,
announce
us
as
,
"
Them
two
young
lady
,
Missis
Jellyby
!
"
 
<EOS>
We
pass
several
more
child
on
the
way
up
,
whom
it
be
difficult
to
avoid
tread
on
in
the
dark
;
and
as
we
come
into
Mrs
Jellyby
's
presence
,
one
of
the
poor
little
thing
fall
downstairs
---
down
a
whole
flight
(
as
it
sound
to
me
)
,
with
a
great
noise
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Jellyby
,
whose
face
reflect
none
of
the
uneasiness
which
we
could
not
help
show
in
our
own
face
as
the
dear
child
's
head
record
its
passage
with
a
bump
on
every
stair
<EOS>
---
Richard
afterwards
say
he
count
seven
,
besides
one
for
the
landing
---
receive
us
with
perfect
equanimity
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
pretty
,
very
diminutive
,
plump
woman
of
from
forty
to
fifty
,
with
handsome
eye
,
though
they
have
a
curious
habit
of
seem
to
look
a
long
way
off
.
 
<EOS>
as
if
---
I
be
quote
Richard
again
---
they
could
see
nothing
near
than
Africa
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
indeed
,
"
say
Mrs
Jellyby
in
an
agreeable
voice
,
"
to
have
the
pleasure
of
receive
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
respect
for
Mr
Jarndyce
,

no
one
in
whom
he
be
interested
can
be
an
object
of
indifference

me

"
   
<EOS>
We
express
our
acknowledgment
and
sit
down
behind
the
door
,
where
there
be
a
lame
invalid
of
a
sofa
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jellyby
have
very
good
hair
but
be
too
much
occupy
with
her
african
duty
to
brush
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
shawl
in
which
she
have
be
loosely
muffle
drop
onto
her
chair
when
she
advance
to
us
;
and
as
she
turn
to
resume
her
seat
,
we
could
not
help
notice
that
her
dress
do
not
nearly
meet
up
the
back
and
that
the
open
space
be
rail
across
with
a
lattice
-
work
of
stay
-
lace
---
like
a
summer
-
house
.
   
<EOS>
the
room
,
which
be
strew
with
paper
and
nearly
fill
by
a
great
writing
-
table
cover
with
similar
litter
,
be
,
I
must
say
,
not
only
very
untidy
but
very
dirty
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
oblige
to
take
notice
of
that
with
our
sense
of
sight
,
even
while
,
with
our
sense
of
hearing
,
we
follow
the
poor
child
who
have
tumble
downstairs
:
I
think
into
the
back
kitchen
,
where
somebody
seem
to
stifle
him
.
   
<EOS>
but
what
principally
strike
us
be
a
jaded
and
unhealthy
-
look
though
by
no
mean
plain
girl
at
the
writing
-
table
,
who
sit
bite
the
feather
of
her
pen
and
stare
at
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
nobody
ever
be
in
such
a
state
of
ink
.
 
<EOS>
and
from
her
tumbled
hair
to
her
pretty
foot
,
which
be
disfigure
with
fray
and
break
satin
slipper
trodden
down
at
heel
,
she
really
seem
to
have
no
article
of
dress
upon
her
,
from
a
pin
upwards
,
that
be
in
its
proper
condition
or
its
right
place
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
find
me
,
my

"
say
Mrs
Jellyby
,
snuff
the
two
great
office
candle
in
tin
candlestick
,
which
make
the
room
taste
strongly
of
hot
tallow
(
the
fire
have
go
out
,
and
there
be
nothing
in
the
grate

ashe

a
bundle
of
wood

a
poker

<EOS>
,
"
you
find
me

very
busy

coffee

as
Ada

nothing

look
at

I

must
be
very
gratifying

I
be
more
confident
of
success
every

<EOS>
do
you
know

I
almost
wonder

you
never

your
thought

Africa

<EOS>
this
application
of
the
subject
be
really
so
unexpected
to
me
that
I
be
quite
at
a
loss

to
receive
it

Peepy
(
so
self

name

be
the
unfortunate
child
who
have
fall
downstairs
,
who
now
interrupt
the
correspondence
by
present
himself
,
with
a
strip
of
plaster
on
his
forehead
,
to
exhibit
his
wounded
knee
,
in
which
Ada
and
I
do
not
know
which
to
pity
most
---
 
the
bruise
or
the
dirt
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jellyby
merely
add
,
with
the
serene
composure
with
which
she
say
everything
,
"
go
along
,
you
naughty
Peepy
!
"
and
fix
her
fine
eye
on
Africa
again
.
   
<EOS>
however
,
as
she
at
once
proceed
with
her
dictation
,
and
as
I
interrupt
nothing
by
do
it
,
I
venture
quietly
to
stop
poor
Peepy
as
he
be
go
out
and
to
take
him
up
to
nurse
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
very
much
astonish
at
it
and
at
Ada
's
kiss
him
,
but
soon
fall
fast
asleep
in
my
arm
,
sob
at
longer
and
long
interval
,
until
he
be
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
occupied
with
Peepy
that
I
lose
the
letter
in
detail
,
<EOS>
though
I
derive
such
a
general
impression
from
it
of
the
momentous
importance
of
Africa
,
and
the
utter
insignificance
of
all
other
place
and
thing
,
that
I
feel
quite
ashamed
to
have
think
so
little
about
it
.

"
six
o'clock

Mrs

oh

that
very
bad
child
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
put
him
down
,
Miss
Summerson

"
   
<EOS>
I
beg
permission
to
retain
him
,
truly
say
that
he
be
not
at
all
troublesome
,
and
carry
him
upstairs
and
lay
him
on
my
bed

<EOS>
Ada
and
I
have
two
upper
room
with
a
door
of
communication
between
.
<EOS>
They
be
excessively
bare
and
disorderly
,
and
the
curtain
to
my
window
be
fasten
up
with
a
fork
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
would
like
some
hot
water
,
would
not
you
?
"
say
Miss
Jellyby
,
look
round
for
a
jug
with
a
handle
to
it
,
but
look
in
vain
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
not
be
troublesome

say
we
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
it
be
not
the
trouble
,
"
return
Miss
Jellyby
;
"
the
question
be
,
if
there
be
any
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
evening
be
so
very
cold
and
the
room
have
such
a
marshy
smell
that
I
must
confess
it
be
a
little
miserable
,
and
Ada
be
half
cry
.
 
<EOS>
We
soon
laugh
,
however
,
and
be
busily
unpack
when
Miss
Jellyby
come
back
to
say
that
she
be
sorry
there
be
no
hot
water
,
but
they
could
not
find
the
kettle
,
and
the
boiler
be
out
of
order
.
   
<EOS>
We
beg
her
not
to
mention
it
and
make
all
the
haste
we
could
to
get
down
to
the
fire
again
.
 
<EOS>
but
all
the
little
child
have
come
up
to
the
landing
outside
to
look
at
the
phenomenon
of
Peepy
lie
on
my
bed
,
and
our
attention
be
distract
by
the
constant
apparition
of
nose
and
finger
in
situation
of
danger
between
the
hinge
of
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
shut
the
door
of
either
room
,
for
my
lock
,
with
no
knob
to
it
<EOS>
,
look
as
if
it
want
to
be
wind
up
;
and
though
the
handle
of
Ada
's
go
round
and
round
with
the
great
smoothness
,
it
be
attend
with
no
effect
<EOS>
whatever
on
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
I
propose
to
the
child
that
they
should
come
in
and
be
very
good
at
my
table
,
and
I
would
tell
them
the
story
of
Little
Red
Riding
Hood
while
I
dress
;
which
they
do
,
and
be
as
quiet
as
mouse
,
include
Peepy
,
who
awake
opportunely
before
the
appearance
of
the
wolf
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
go
downstairs
we
find
a
mug
with
"
a
present
from
Tunbridge
Wells
"
on
it
light
up
in
the
staircase
window
with
a
float
wick
,
and
a
young
woman
,
with
a
swelled
face
bind
up
in
a
flannel
bandage
blow
the
fire
of
the
drawing
-
room
(
now
connect
by
an
open
door
with
Mrs
Jellyby
's
room
)
and
choke
dreadfully
.
<EOS>
It
smoke
to
that
degree
,
in
short
,
that
we
all
sit
cough
and
cry
with
the
window
open
for
half
an
hour
,
during
which
Mrs
Jellyby
,
with
the
same
sweetness
of
temper
,
direct
letter
about
Africa
.
 
<EOS>
Her
be
so
employed
be
,
I
must
say
,
a
great
relief
to
me
,
for
Richard
tell
us
that
he
have
wash
his
hand
in
a
pie
-
dish
and
that
they
have
find
the
kettle
on
his
dressing
-
table
,
and
he
make
Ada
laugh
so
that
they
make
me
laugh
in
the
most
ridiculous
manner

<EOS>
soon
after
seven
o'clock
we
go
down
to
dinner
,
carefully
,
by
Mrs
Jellyby
's
advice
,
for
the
stair
-
carpet
,
besides
be
very
deficient
in
stair
-
wire
,
be
so
torn
as
to
be
absolute
trap
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
a
fine
cod
-
fish
,
a
piece
of
roast
beef
,
a
dish
of
cutlet
,
and
a
pudding
;
an
excellent
dinner
,
if
it
have
have
any
cooking
to
speak
of
,
but
it
be
almost
raw
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
woman
with
the
flannel
bandage
wait
,
and
drop
everything
on
the
table
wherever
it
happen
to
go
,
and
never
move
it
again
until
she
put
it
on
the
stair
.
 
<EOS>
the
person
I
have
see
in
patten
,
who
I
suppose
to
have
be
the
cook
,
frequently
come
and
skirmish
with
her
at
the
door
,
and
there
appear
to
be
ill
will
between
them
.
   
<EOS>
all
through
dinner
---
which
be
long
,
in
consequence
of
such
accident
as
the
dish
of
potato
be
mislay
in
the
coal
skuttle
and
the
handle
of
the
corkscrew
come
off
and
strike
the
young
woman
in
the
chin
---
Mrs
Jellyby
preserve
the
evenness
of
her
disposition
.
 
<EOS>
She
tell
us
a
great
deal
that
be
interesting
about
Borrioboola
-
Gha
and
the
native
,
and
receive
so
many
letter
that
Richard
,
who
sit
by
her
,
see
four
envelope
in
the
gravy
at
once
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
letter
be
proceeding
of
lady
'
committee
or
resolution
of
lady
'
meeting
,
which
she
read
to
us
;
other
be
application
from
people

in
various
way
about
the
cultivation
of
coffee
,
and
native
;
other
require
answer
,
and
these
she
send
her
eld
daughter
from
the
table
three
or
four
time
to
write
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
full
of
business
and
undoubtedly
be
,
as
she
have
tell
us
,
devote
to
the
cause
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
a
little
curious
to
know
who
a
mild
bald
gentleman
in
spectacles
be
,
who
drop
into
a
vacant
chair
<EOS>
(
there
be
no
top
or
bottom
in
particular
)
<EOS>
after
the
fish
be
take
away
and
seem
passively
to
submit
himself
to
Borriohoola
-
Gha
but
not
to
be
actively
interested
in
that
settlement
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
never
speak
a
word
,
he
may
have
be
a
native
but
for
his
complexion
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
we
leave
the
table
and
he
remain
alone
with
Richard
that
the
possibility
of
his
be
Mr
Jellyby
ever
enter
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
Mr
Jellyby
;
and
a
loquacious
young
man
call
Mr
Quale
,
with
large
shine
knob
for
temple
and
his
hair
all
brush
to
the
back
of
his
head
,
who
come
in
the
evening
,
and
tell
Ada
he
be
a
philanthropist
,
<EOS>
also
inform
her
that
he
call
the
matrimonial
alliance
of
Mrs
Jellyby
with
Mr
Jellyby
the
union
of
mind
and
matter
.
   
<EOS>
this
young
man
,
besides
have
a
great
deal
to
say
for
himself
about
Africa
and
a
project
of
his
for
teach
the
coffee
colonist
to
teach
the
native
to
turn
piano
-
forte
leg
and
establish
an
export
trade
,
delighted
in
draw
Mrs
Jellyby
out
by
save
,
"
I
believe
now
,
Mrs
Jellyby
,
you
have
receive
as
many
as
from
one
hundred
and
fifty
to
two
hundred
letter
respect
Africa
in
a
single
day
,
have
you
not
?
"
<EOS>
or
,
"
if
my
memory
do
not
deceive
me
,
Mrs
Jellyby
,
you
once
mention
that
you
have
send
off
five
thousand
circular
from
one
post
-
office
at
one
time
?
"
<EOS>
---
always
repeat
Mrs
Jellyby
's
answer
to
us
like
an
interpreter
.
 
<EOS>
during
the
whole
evening
,
Mr
Jellyby
sit
in
a
corner
with
his
head
against
the
wall
as
if
he
be
subject
to
low
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
that
he
have
several
time
open
his
mouth
when
alone
with
Richard
after
dinner
,
as
if
he
have
something
on
his
mind
,
but
have
always
shut
it
again
,
to
Richard
's
extreme
confusion
,
without
say
anything
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Jellyby
,
sit
in
quite
a
nest
of
waste
paper
,
drank
coffee
all
the
evening
and
dictate
at
interval
to
her
eld
daughter
.
<EOS>
She
also
hold
a
discussion
with
Mr
Quale
,
of
which
the
subject
seem
to
be
---
if
I
understand
it
---
the
brotherhood
of
humanity
,
and
give
utterance
to
some
beautiful
sentiment
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
so
attentive
an
auditor
as
I
may
have
wish
to
be
,
however
,
for
Peepy
and
the
other
child
<EOS>
come
flock
about
Ada
and
me
in
a
corner
of
the
drawing
-
room
to
ask
for
another
story
;
so
we
sit
down
among
them
and
tell
them
in
whisper
"
Puss
in
boot
"
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
know
what
else
until
Mrs
Jellyby
,
accidentally
remember
them
,
send
them
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
as
Peepy
cry
for
me
to
take
him
to
bed
,
I
carry
him
upstairs
,
where
the
young
woman
with
the
flannel
bandage
charge
into
the
midst
of
the
little
family
like
a
dragon
and
overturn
them
into
cribs
.
   
<EOS>
after
that
I
occupy
myself
in
make
our
room
a
little
tidy
and
in
coax
a
very
cross
fire
that
have
be
light
to
burn
,
which
at
last
it
do
,
quite
brightly
.
 
<EOS>
on
my
return
downstairs
,
I
feel
that
Mrs
Jellyby
look
down
upon
me
rather
for
be
so
frivolous
,
and
I
be
sorry
for
it
,
though
at
the
same
time
I
know
that
I
have
no
high
pretension
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
nearly
midnight
before
we
find
an
opportunity
of
go
to
bed
,
and
even
then
we
leave
Mrs
Jellyby
among
her
paper
drink
coffee
and
Miss
Jellyby
bite
the
feather
of
her
pen
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
a
strange
house
!
"
say
Ada
when
we
get
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
It
MUST

<EOS>
Ada
laugh
and
put
her
arm
about
my
neck
as
I
stand
look
at

and

so
much
of
me

<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
you
a
question

shake

with
such

I
be

<EOS>
no

she
have
never

<EOS>
Young
<EOS>
as
she
be
when
her
mama
die
,
she
remember
how
the
tear
would
come
into
her
eye
when
she
speak
of
him
and
of
the
noble
generosity
of
his
character
,
which
she
have
say
be
to
be
trust
above
all
earthly
thing
;
and
Ada
trust
it
.
 
<EOS>
Her
cousin
Jarndyce
have
write
to
her
a
few
month
ago
---
"
a
plain
,
honest
letter
,
"
Ada
say
---
propose
the
arrangement
we
be
now
to
enter
on
and
tell
her
that
"
in
time
it
may
heal
some
of
the
wound
make
by
the
miserable
chancery
suit

"
 
<EOS>
She
have
reply
,
gratefully
accept
his
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
have
receive
a
similar
letter
and
have
make
a
similar
response
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
see
Mr
Jarndyce
once
,
but
only
once
,
five
year
ago
,
at
Winchester
school
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
Ada
,
when
they
be
lean
on
the
screen
before
the
fire
where
I
find
them
,
that
he
recollect
him
as
"
a
bluff
,
rosy
fellow
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
utmost
description
Ada
could
give
me
.
   
<EOS>
It
set
me
think
so
that
when
Ada
be
asleep
,
I
still
remain
before
the
fire
,
wonder
and
wonder
about
Bleak
House
,
and
wonder
and
wonder
that
yesterday
morning
should
seem
so
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
where
my
thought
have
wander
when
they
be
recall
by
a
tap
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
I
open
it
softly
and
find
Miss
Jellyby
shiver
there
with
a
break
candle
in
a
broken
candlestick
in
one
hand
and
an
egg
-
cup
in
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
good

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she

very
sulkily

<EOS>
"

"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
come
in
?
<EOS>
"
she
shortly
and
unexpectedly
ask
me
in
the
same
sulky
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
"
say
I.
 
"
do
not
wake
Miss
Clare
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
would
not
sit
down
,
but
stand
by
the
fire
dip
her
inky
middle
finger
in
the
egg
-
cup
,
which
contain
vinegar
,
and
smear
it
over
the
ink
stain
on
her
face
,
frown
the
whole
time
and
look
very
gloomy
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish

on
a
sudden
.
   
<EOS>
I

<EOS>

<EOS>
I
tell
her
she
be
tired

and
I
be
sorry

<EOS>
I
put
my
hand
upon
her
head
,
and
touch
her
forehead
,
and
say
it
be
hot
now

would
be
cool
tomorrow

<EOS>
She
still
stand
pout
and
frown
at
me
,
but
presently
put
down
her
egg
-
cup
and
turn
softly
towards
the
bed
where
Ada
lie
.
   
<EOS>
"
She

very
pretty

<EOS>
she
say
with
the
same
knit
brow
and
in
the

uncivil
manner

assent
with
a
smile

<EOS>
"

say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
I

she
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
I
could
see
that
the
poor
girl
be
near
cry
,
and
I
resume
my
chair
without
speak
and
look
at
her
(
I
hope

as
mildly
as
I
feel
towards

Her
bosom
be
heave
in
a
distressful
manner
that
I
greatly
pity
,
but
I
think
it
better
not
to
speak
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
be
dead
!
"
<EOS>
she
break
out
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
we
be
all
dead
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
great
deal
better
for
us
.
   
<EOS>
in
a
moment
afterwards
,
she
kneel
on
the
ground
at
my
side
,
hide
her
face
in
my
dress
,
passionately
beg
my
pardon
,
and
weep
.
 
<EOS>
I
comfort
her
and
would
have
raise
her
,
but
she
cry
no
,
no
<EOS>
;
she
want
to
stay
there
!
   
<EOS>
"
You
use
to
teach
girl
,
"
she
say
,
"
if
you
could
only
have
teach
me
,
I
could
have
learn
from
you
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
very
miserable
,
and
I
like
you
so
much
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
persuade
her
to
sit
by
me
or
to
do
anything
but
move
a
ragged
stool
to
where
she
be
kneel
,
and
take
that
,
and
still
hold
my
dress
in
the
same
manner
.
 
<EOS>
by
degree
the
poor
tired
girl
fall
asleep
,
and
then
I
contrive
to
raise
her
head
so
that
it
should
rest
on
my
lap
,
and
to
cover
us
both
with
shawl
.
 
<EOS>
the
fire
go
out
,
and
all
night
long
she
slumber
thus
before
the
ashy
grate
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
I
be
painfully
awake
and
vainly
try
to
lose
myself
,
with
my
eye
close
,
among
the
scene
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
by
slow
degree
,
they
become
indistinct
and
mingle
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
lose
the
identity
of
the
sleeper
rest
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
now
it
be
Ada
,
now
one
of
my
old
Reading
friend
from
whom
I
could
not
believe
I
have
so
recently
part
.
 
<EOS>
now
it
be
the
little
mad
woman
wear
out
with
curtsy
and
smile
,
now
some
one
in
authority
at
Bleak
House
.
 
<EOS>
lastly
,
it
be
no
one
,
and
I
be
no
one
.
   
<EOS>
the
purblind
day
be
feebly
struggle
with
the
fog
when
I
open
my
eye
to
encounter
those
of
a
dirty
-
faced
little
spectre
fix
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
Peepy
have
scale
his
crib
,
and
creep
down
in
his
bed
-
gown
and
cap
,
and
be
so
cold
that
his
tooth
be
chatter
as
if
he
have
cut
them
all

Chapter

<EOS>
a
Morning
Adventure
 
<EOS>
although
the
morning
be
raw
,
and
although
the
fog
still
seem
heavy
---
I
say
seem
,
for
the
window
be
so
encrusted
with
dirt
that
they
would
have
make
midsummer
sunshine
dim
---
I
be
sufficiently
forewarn
of
the
discomfort
within
door
at
that
early
hour
and
sufficiently
curious
about
London
to
think
it
a
good
idea
on
the
part
of
Miss
Jellyby
when
she
propose
that
we
should
go
out
for
a
walk
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ma
will
not
be
down
for
ever
so
long
,
"
she
say
,
"
and
then
it
be
a
chance
if
breakfast
be
ready
for
an
hour
afterwards
<EOS>
,
they
dawdle
so
.
<EOS>
as
to
Pa
,
he
get
what
he
can
and
go
to
the
office
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
have
what
you
would
call
a
regular
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
Priscilla
leave
him
out
the
loaf
and
some
milk
,
when
there
be
any
,
overnight
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
there
be
not
any
milk
,
and
sometimes
the
cat
drink
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
afraid
you
must
be
tired
,
Miss
Summerson
,
and
perhaps
you
would
rather
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
at
all
tired
,
my
dear
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
would
much
prefer
to
go
out
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
sure
you
would
,
"
return
Miss
Jellyby
,
"
I
will
get
my
thing
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
Ada
say
she
would
go
too
,
and
be
soon
astir
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
a
proposal
to
Peepy
,
in
default
of
be
able
to
do
anything
well
for
him
,
that
he
should
let
me
wash
him
and
afterwards
lie
him
down
on
my
bed
again
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
he
submit
with
the
good
grace
possible
,
stare
at
me
during
the
whole
operation
as
if
he
never
have
be
,
and
never
could
again
be
,
so
astonished
in
his
life
---
look
very
miserable
also
,
certainly
,
but
make
no
complaint
,
and
go
snugly
to
sleep
as
soon
as
it
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
I
be
in
two
mind
about
take
such
a
liberty
,
but
I
soon
reflect
that
nobody
in
the
house
be
likely
to
notice
it
.
   
<EOS>
what
with
the
bustle
of
dispatch
Peepy
and
the
bustle
of
get
myself
ready
and
help
Ada
,
I
be
soon
quite
in
a
glow
.
 
<EOS>
We
find
Miss
Jellyby
try
to
warm
herself
at
the
fire
in
the
writing
-
room
,
which
Priscilla
be
then
light
with
a
smutty
parlour
candlestick
,
throw
the
candle
in
to
make
it
burn
better
.
<EOS>
everything
be
just
as
we
have
leave
it
last
night
and
be
evidently
intend
to
remain
so
.
 
<EOS>
Below
-
stair
the
dinner
-
cloth
have
not
be
take
away
,
but
have
be
leave
ready
for
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
Crumbs
,
dust
,
and
waste
-
paper
be
all
over
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
some
pewter
pot
and
a
milk
-
can
hung
on
the
area
railing
;
the
door
stand
open
;
and
we
meet
the
cook
round
the
corner
come
out
of
a
public
-
house
,
wipe
her
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
She
mention
,
as
she
pass
us
,
that
she
have
be
to
see
what
o'clock
it
be
.
   
<EOS>
but
before
we
meet
the
cook
,
we
meet
Richard
,
who
be
dance
up
and
down
thavie
Inn
to
warm
his
foot
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
agreeably
surprised
to
see
us
stir
so
soon
and
say
he
would
gladly
share
our
walk
.
<EOS>
so
he
take
care
of
Ada
,
and
Miss
Jellyby
<EOS>
and
I
go
first
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
mention
that
Miss
Jellyby
have
relapse
into
her
sulky
manner
and
that
I
really
should
not
have
think
she
like
me
much
unless
she
have
tell
me
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
where
would
you
wish
to
go
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
anywhere
,
my
dear
,
"
I
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Anywhere
be
nowhere
,
"
say
Miss
Jellyby
,
stop
perversely
.
   
<EOS>
"
let
us
go
somewhere
at
any
rate
,
"
say
<EOS>
I.
   
She
then
walk
me
on
very
fast
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
you
be
my
witness
,
Miss
Summerson
<EOS>
,
I
say
I
do
not
care
-
<EOS>
but
if
he
be
to
come
to
our
house
with
his
great
,
shine
,
lumpy
forehead
night
after
night
till
he
be
as
old
as
Methuselah
,
I
would
not
have
anything
to
say
to
him
.
<EOS>
such
ass
as
he
and
Ma
make
of
themselves
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
!
<EOS>
"
I
remonstrate
,
in
allusion
to
the
epithet
and
the
vigorous
emphasis
Miss
Jellyby
set
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
duty
as
a
child
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
do
not
talk
of
duty
as
a
child
,
Miss
Summerson
;
where
be
Ma
's
duty
as
a
parent
?
 
<EOS>
all
make
over
to
the
public
and
Africa
,
I
suppose
!
 
<EOS>
then
let
the
public
and
Africa
show
duty
as
a
child
;
it
be
much
more
their
affair
than
mine
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
shocked
,
I
dare
say
!
<EOS>
very
well
,
so
be
I
shock
too
;
so
we
be
both
shocked
,
and
there
be
an
end
of
it
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
She
walk
me
on
faster
yet
.
   
<EOS>
"
but
for
all
that
,
I
say
again
,
he
may
come
,
and
come
,
and
come
,
and
I
will
not
have
anything
to
say
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
him
.
 
<EOS>
if
there
be
any
stuff
in
the
world
that
I
hate
and
det
,
it
be
the
stuff
he
and
Ma
talk
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
the
very
paving
-
stone
opposite
our
house
can
have
the
patience
to
stay
there
and
be
a
witness
of
such
inconsistency
and
contradiction
as
all
that
sound
nonsense
,
and
Ma
's
management
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
understand
her
to
refer
to
Mr
Quale
,
the
young
gentleman
who
have
appear
after
dinner
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
save
the
disagreeable
necessity
of
pursue
the
subject
by
Richard
and
Ada
come
up
at
a
round
pace
,
laugh
and
ask
us
if
we
mean
to
run
a
race
.
 
<EOS>
thus
interrupt
,
Miss
Jellyby
become
silent
and
walk
moodily
on
at
my
side
while
I
admire
the
long
succession
and
variety
of
street
,
the
quantity
of
people
already
go
to
and
fro
,
the
number
of
vehicle
pass
and
repasse
,
the
busy
preparation
in
the
setting
forth
of
shop
window
and
the
sweeping
out
of
shop
,
and
the
extraordinary
creature
in
rag
secretly
grope
among
the
sweep
-
out
rubbish
for
pin
and
other
refuse
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
,
cousin

say
the
cheerful
voice
of
Richard
to
Ada
behind
me
.
<EOS>
"
We

with
such
dreadful
recollection
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
another
uneasiness
,
in
the
application
of
the
painful
story
to
the
poor
half
-
witted
creature
who
have
bring
us
there
;
but
,
to
my
surprise
,
she
seem
perfectly
unconscious
of
that
and
only
lead
the
way
upstairs
again
,
inform
us
with
the
toleration
of
a
superior
creature
for
the
infirmity
of
a
common
mortal
that
her
landlord
be
"
a
little
M
,
you
know
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
live
at
the
top
of
the
house
,
in
a
pretty
large
room
,
from
which
she
have
a
glimpse
of
Lincoln
's
Inn
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
this
seem
to
have
be
her
principal
inducement
,
originally
,
for
take
up
her
residence
there
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
look
at
it
,
she
say
,
in
the
night
,
especially
in
the
moonshine
.
 
<EOS>
Her
room
be
clean
,
but
very
,
very
bare
.
 
<EOS>
I
notice
the
scanty
necessary
in
the
way
of
furniture
;
a
few
old
print
from
book
,
of
chancellor
and
barrister
,
wafere
against
the
wall
;
and
some
half
-
dozen
reticle
and
work
-
bag
,
"
contain
document
,
"
as
she
inform
us
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
neither
coal
nor
ashe
in
the
grate
,
and
I
see
no
article
of
clothing
anywhere
,
nor
any
kind
of
food
.
 
<EOS>
upon
a
shelf
in
an
open
cupboard
be
a
plate
or
two
,
a
cup
or
two
,
and
so
forth
,
but
all
dry
and
empty
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
more
affecting
meaning
in
her
pinched
appearance
<EOS>
,
I
think
as
I
look
round
,
than
I
have
understand
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
extremely
honoured
,
I
be
sure
,
"
say
our
poor
hostess
with
the
great
suavity
,
"
by
this
visit
from
the
ward
in
Jarndyce
.
 
<EOS>
and
very
much
indebted
for
the
oman
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
retired
situation
.
<EOS>
consider
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
limit
as
to
situation
.
 
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
the
necessity
of
attend
on
the
Chancellor
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
live
here
many
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
pass
my
day
in
court
,
my
evening
and
my
night
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
the
night
long
,
for
I
sleep
<EOS>
but
little
and
think
much
.
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
of
course
,
unavoidable
,
be
in
Chancery
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
I
can
not
offer
chocolate
.
 
<EOS>
I
expect
a
judgment
shortly
and
shall
then
place
my
establishment
on
a
superior
footing
.
 
<EOS>
at
present
,
I
do
not
mind
confess
to
the
ward
in
Jarndyce
(
in
strict
confidence
)
that
I
sometimes
find
it
difficult
to
keep
up
a
genteel
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
feel
the
cold
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
feel
something
sharp
than
cold
.
<EOS>
It
matter
very
little
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
excuse
the
introduction
of
such
mean
topic
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
partly
draw
aside
the
curtain
of
the
long
,
low
garret
window
and
call
our
attention
to
a
number
of
bird
-
cage
hang
there
,
some
contain
several
bird
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
lark
,
linnet
,
and
goldfinch
---
I
should
think
at
least
twenty
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
keep
the
little
creature
,
"
she
say
,
"
with
an
object
that
the
ward
will
readily
comprehend
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
intention
of
restore
them
to
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
when
my
judgment
should
be
give
.
 
<EOS>
Ye
-
es
!
 
<EOS>
They
die
in
prison
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
Their
life
,
poor
silly
thing
,
be
so
short
in
comparison
with
chancery
proceeding
that
,
one
by
one
,
the
whole
collection
have
die
over
and
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
,
do
you
know
,
whether
one
of
these
,
though
they
be
all
young
,
will
live
to
be
free
!
 
<EOS>
Ve
-
ry
mortifying
,
be
it
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
although
she
sometimes
ask
a
question
,
she
never
seem
to
expect
a
reply
,
but
ramble
on
as
if
she
be
in
the
habit
of
do
so
when
no
one
but
herself
be
present
.
   
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
"
she
pursue
,
"
I
positively
doubt
sometimes
,
I
do
assure
you
,
whether
while
matter
be
still
unsettle
,
and
the
sixth
or
Great
Seal
still
prevail
,
I
may
not
one
day
be
find
lie
stark
and
senseless
here
,
as
I
have
find
so
many
bird
!
"
   
<EOS>
Richard
,
answer
what
he
see
in
Ada
's
compassionate
eye
,
take
the
opportunity
of
lay
some
money
,
softly
and
unobserve
,
on
the
chimney
-
piece
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
draw
near
to
the
cage
,
feign
to
examine
the
bird
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
allow
them
to
sing
much
,
"
say
the
little
old
lady
,
"
for
(
you
will
think
this
curious
)
<EOS>
I
find
my
mind
confuse
by
the
idea
that
they
be
singe
while
I
be
follow
the
argument
in
court
.
<EOS>
and
my
mind
require
to
be
so
very
clear
,
you
know
!
 
<EOS>
another
time
,
I
will
tell
you
their
name
.
 
<EOS>
not
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
on
a
day
of
such
good
oman
,
they
shall
sing
as
much
as
they
like
.
 
<EOS>
in
honour
of
youth
,
"
a
smile
and
curtsy
,
"
hope
,
"
a
smile
and
curtsy
,
"
and
beauty
,
"
a
smile
and
curtsy

<EOS>
"
there
!
 
<EOS>
We
will
let
in
the
full
light
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
bird
begin
to
stir
and
chirp
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
admit
the
air
freely
,
"
say
the
little
old
lady
---
<EOS>
the
room
be
close
,
and
would
have
be
the
well
for
it
---
"
because
the
cat
you
see
downstairs
,
call
Lady
Jane
,
be
greedy
for
their
life
.
<EOS>
She
crouch
on
the
parapet
outside
for
hour
and
hour
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
discover
,
"
whisper
mysteriously
,
"
that
her
natural
cruelty
be
sharpen
by
a
jealous
fear
of
their
regain
their
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
the
judgment
I
expect
be
shortly
give
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
sly
and
full
of
malice
.
 
<EOS>
I
half
believe
,
sometimes
,
that
she
be
no
cat
,
but
the
wolf
of
the
old
saying
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
very
difficult
to
keep
her
from
the
door
.
"
   
<EOS>
some
neighbouring
bell
,
remind
the
poor
soul
that
it
be
half
-
past
nine
,
do
more
for
us
in
the
way
of
bring
our
visit
to
an
end
than
we
could
easily
have
do
for
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
She
hurriedly
take
up
her
little
bag
of
document
,
which
she
have
lay
upon
the
table
on
come
in
,
and
ask
if
we
be
also
go
into
court
.
 
<EOS>
on
our
answer
no
,
and
that
we
would
on
no
account
detain
her
,
she
open
the
door
to
attend
us
downstairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
with
such
an
oman
,
it
be
even
more
necessary
than
usual
that
I
should
be
there
before
the
Chancellor
come
in
,
"
say
she
,
"
for
he
may
mention
my
case
the
first
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
presentiment
that
he
WILL
mention
it
the
first
thing
this
morning
"
   
<EOS>
She
stop
to
tell
us
in
a
whisper
as
we
be
go
down
that
the
whole
house
be
fill
with
strange
lumber
which
her
landlord
have
buy
piecemeal
and
have
no
wish
to
sell
,
in
consequence
of
be
a
little
m.
 
<EOS>
this
be
on
the
first
floor
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
have
make
a
previous
stoppage
on
the
second
floor
and
have
silently
point
at
a
dark
door
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
only
other
lodger
,
"
she
now
whisper
in
explanation
,
"
a
law
-
writer
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
in
the
lane
here
say
he
have
sell
himself
to
the
devil
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
he
can
have
do
with
the
money
.
<EOS>
Hush
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
appear
to
mistrust
that
the
lodger
may
hear
her
even
there
,
and
repeat
"
Hush
!
<EOS>
"
go
before
us
on
tiptoe
as
though
even
the
sound
of
her
footstep
may
reveal
to
him
what
she
have
say
.
   
<EOS>
pass
through
the
shop
on
our
way
out
,
as
we
have
pass
through
it
on
our
way
in
,
we
find
the
old
man
store
a
quantity
of
packet
of
waste
-
paper
in
a
kind
of
well
in
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
to
be
work
hard
,
with
the
perspiration
stand
on
his
forehead
,
and
have
a
piece
of
chalk
by
him
,
with
which
,
as
he
put
each
separate
package
or
bundle
down
,
he
make
a
crooked
mark
on
the
panelling
of
the
wall
.
   
<EOS>
Richard
and
Ada
,
and
Miss
Jellyby
,
and
the
little
old
lady
have
go
by
him
,
and
I
be
go
when
he
touch
me
on
the
arm
to
stay
me
,
and
chalk
the
letter
J
upon
the
wall
---
in
a
very
curious
manner
,
begin
with
the
end
of
the
letter
and
shape
it
backward
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
capital
letter
,
not
a
print
one
,
but
just
such
a
letter
as
any
clerk
in
Messrs.
Kenge
and
Carboy
's
office
would
have
make
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
you
read
it
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
me
with
a
keen
glance
.
   
<EOS>
"
surely
,
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
plain
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
J.
"
   
with
another
glance
at
me
,
and
a
glance
at
the
door
,
he
rub
it
out
and
turn
an
"
a
"
in
its
place
(
not
a
capital
letter
this
time
)
,
and
say
,
"
what
be
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
tell
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
rub
that
out
and
turn
the
letter
"
r
,
"
and
ask
me
the
same
question
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
on
quickly
until
he
have
form
in
the
same
curious
manner
,
begin
at
the
end
and
bottom
of
the
letter
,
the
word
Jarndyce
,
without
once
leave
two
letter
on
the
wall
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
do
that
spell
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
me
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
tell
him
,
he
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
same
odd
way
,
yet
with
the
same
rapidity
,
he
then
produce
singly
,
and
rub
out
singly
,
the
letter
form
the
word
Bleak
House
.
 
<EOS>
these
,
in
some
astonishment
,
I
also
read
;
and
he
laugh
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
hi
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
old
man
,
lay
aside
the
chalk
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
turn
for
copy
from
memory
,
you
see

miss

though
I
can
neither
read
nor
write

"
   
<EOS>
He
look
so
disagreeable
and
his
cat
look
so
wickedly
at
me
,
as
if
I
be
a
blood
-
relation
of
the
bird
upstairs
,
that
I
be
quite
relieve
by
<EOS>
Richard
's
appear
at
the
door
and
say
,
"

<EOS>
I
lose
no
time
in
wish
Mr
Krook
<EOS>
good
morning
and
join
my
friend
outside
,
where
we
part
with
the
little
old
lady
,
who
give
us
her
blessing
with
great
ceremony
and
renew
her
assurance
of
yesterday
in
reference
to
her
intention
of
settle
estate
on
Ada
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
before
we
finally
turn
out
of
those
lane
,
we
look
back
and
see
Mr
Krook
stand
at
his
shop
-
door
,
in
his
spectacle
,
look
after
us
,
with
his
cat
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
her
tail
stick
up
on
one
side
of
his
hairy
cap
like
a
tall
feather

<EOS>
"
quite
an
adventure
for
a
morning
in
London
!

say
Richard
with
a
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
cousin
,
cousin
,
it
be
a
weary
word
this
chancery
!

<EOS>
"
It
be
to
me
,
and
have
be
ever
since
I
can
remember

return
Ada

<EOS>
"
I
be
grieve
that
I
should
be
the
enemy

<EOS>
I
suppose
I
be

of
a
great
number
of
relation
and
other
,
and
that
they
should
be
my
enemy

as
I
suppose
they
be

and
that
we
should
all
be
ruin
one
another
without
know
how
or
why
and
be
in
constant
doubt
and
discord
all
our
life

<EOS>
It
seem
very
strange
,
as
there
must
be
right
somewhere
,
that
an
honest
judge
in
real
earnest
have
not
be
able
to
find
out
through
all
these
year
where
it
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
ah
,
cousin
!
"
say
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
strange
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
all
this
wasteful
,
wanton
chess

play
be
very
strange

<EOS>
to
see
that
compose
court
yesterday
jog
on
so
serenely
and
to
think
of
the
wretchedness
of
the
piece
on

board
give
me
the
headache

the
heartache
both
together

ache
with
wonder
how
it
happen

if
man
be
neither
fool

rascal

my
heart
ache
to
think
they
could
possibly
be
either

Ada

I
may
call
you

you

will
work
none

never

say
Ada
gently
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Jellyby
give
my
arm
a
squeeze
and
me
a
very
significant
look
.
<EOS>
I
smile
in
return
,
and
we
make
the
rest
of
the
way
back
very
pleasantly
.
   
<EOS>
in
half
an
hour
after
our
arrival
,
Mrs
Jellyby
appear
;
and
in
the
course
of
an
hour
the
various
thing
necessary
for
breakfast
straggle
one
by
one
into
the
dining

room

<EOS>
I
do
not
doubt
that
Mrs
Jellyby
have
go
to
bed
and
get
up
in
the
usual
manner

but
she
present
no
appearance

change
her
dress

She
be
greatly
occupy
during
breakfast

for
the
morning

heavy

)
to

a
busy

the
child
tumble
about
,
and
notch
memorandum
of
their
accident
in
their
leg

perfect
little
calendar
of
distress

Peepy

hour

and
bring
home
from
Newgate
market
by

<EOS>
the
equable
manner
in
which
Mrs
Jellyby
sustain
both
his
absence
and
his
restoration
to
the
family
circle
surprise
us
all
.
   
<EOS>
She
be
by
that
time
perseveringly
dictate
to
Caddy

and
Caddy

fast
relapse
into
the
inky
condition
in

find
her

<EOS>
at
one
o'clock
an
open
carriage
arrive
for

and
a
cart
for
our
luggage
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jellyby
charge
us
with
many
remembrance
to
her
good
friend
Mr
Jarndyce

Caddy
leave
her
desk
to
see
us
depart
,
kiss
me
in
the
passage
,
and
stand
bite
her
pen
and
sob
on
the
step
;
Peepy
,
I
be
happy
to
say
,
be
asleep
and
spare
the
pain
of
separation
<EOS>
(
I
be
not
without
misgiving
that
he
have
go
to
Newgate
market
in
search
of
me
)
;
and
all
the
other
child
get
up
behind
the
barouche
and
fall
off
,
and
we
see
them
,
with
great
concern
,
scatter
over
the
surface
of
Thavies
Inn
as
we
roll
out
of
its
precinct

Chapter
6
.
<EOS>
quite
at
home
 
<EOS>
the
day
have
brighten
very
much
,
and
still
brightened
as
we
go
westward
.
 
<EOS>
We
go
our
way
through
the
sunshine
and
the
fresh
air
,
wonder
more
and
more
at
the
extent
of
the
street
,
the
brilliancy
of
the
shop
,
the
great
traffic
,
and
the
crowd
of
people
whom
the
pleasanter
weather
seem
to
have
bring
out
like
many
-
coloured
flower
.
 
<EOS>
by
and
by
we
begin
to
leave
the
wonderful
city
and
to
proceed
through
suburb
which
,
of
themselves
,
would
have
make
a
pretty
large
town
in
my
eye
;
and
at
last
we
get
into
a
real
country
road
again
,
with
windmills
,
rick
-
yard
,
milestone
,
farmer
'
waggon
,
scent
of
old
hay
,
swinge
sign
,
and
horse
trough
:
tree
,
field
,
and
hedge
-
row
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
delightful
to
see
the
green
landscape
before
us
and
the
immense
metropolis
behind
;
and
when
a
waggon
with
a
train
of
beautiful
horse
,
furnish
with
red
trapping
and
clear
-
sound
bell
,
come
by
us
with
its
music
<EOS>
,
I
believe
we
could
all
three
have
sing
to
the
bell
,
so
cheerful
be
the
influence
around
.
   
<EOS>
"
the
whole
road
have
be
remind
me
of
my

Whittington

say
Richard

and
that
waggon
be
the
finish

<EOS>
Halloa
!
<EOS>
what
be
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
We
have
stop
,
and
the
waggon
have
stop
too
.
 
<EOS>
Its
music
change
as
the
horse
come
to
a
stand
,
and
subside
to
a
gentle
tinkling
,
except
when
a
horse
toss
his
head
or
shake
himself
and
sprinkle
off
a
little
shower
of
bell
-
ringing
.

"
Our

these
the
waggoner
deliver
to
each
of

respectively

read
the

aloud
first
.
 
<EOS>
in
answer
to
Richard
's
inquiry
from
whom
they
come
,
he
briefly
answer
,
"
Master
,
sir
,
if
you
please
"
;
and
put
on
his
hat
again
(
which
be
like
a
soft
bowl
)
,
crack
his
whip
,
re
-
awaken
his
music
,
and
go
melodiously
away

We

these

I
look
forward

my

to
our

easily

without

I
therefore
have
to
propose
that
we
meet
as
old
friend
and
take
the
past
for
grant

It
will
be
a
relief

certainly

so
my

<EOS>
John
Jarndyce
"
   
<EOS>
I
have
perhaps
less
reason
to
be
surprised
than
either
of
my
companion
,
have
never
yet
enjoy
an
opportunity
of
thank
one
who
have
be
my
benefactor
and
sole
earthly
dependence
through
so
many
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
consider
how
I
could
thank
him
,
my
gratitude
lie
too
deep
in
my
heart
for
that
;
but
I
now
begin
to
consider
how
I
could
meet
him
without
thank
him
,
and
feel
it
would
be
very
difficult
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
the
note
revive
in
Richard
and
Ada
a
general
impression
that
they
both
have
,
without
quite
know
how
they
come
by
it
,
that
their
cousin
Jarndyce
could
never
bear
acknowledgment
for
any
kindness
he
perform
and
that
sooner
than
receive
any
he
would
resort
to
the
most
singular
expedient
and
evasion
or
would
even
run
away
.
<EOS>
Ada
dimly
remember
to
have
hear
her
mother
tell
,
<EOS>
when
she
be
a
very
little
child
,
that
he
have
once
do
her
an
act
of
uncommon
generosity
and
that
on
her
go
to
his
house
to
thank
him
,
he
happen
to
see
her
through
a
window
come
to
the
door
,
and
immediately
escape
by
the
back
gate
,
and
be
not
hear
of
for
three
month
.
 
<EOS>
this
discourse
lead
to
a
great
deal
more
on
the
same
theme
,
and
indeed
it
last
us
all
day
,
and
we
talk
of
scarcely
anything
else
.
 
<EOS>
if
we
do
by
any
chance
diverge
into
another
subject
,
we
soon
return
to
this
,
and
wonder
what
the
house
would
be
like
,
and
when
we
should
get
there
,
and
whether
we
should
see
Mr
Jarndyce
as
soon
as
we
arrive
or
after
a
delay
,
and
what
he
would
say
to
us
,
and
what
we
should
say
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
all
of
which
we
wonder
about
,
over
and
over
again
.
   
<EOS>
the
road
be
very
heavy
for
the
horse
,
but
the
pathway
be
generally
good
,
so
we
alight
and
walk
up
all
the
hill
,
and
like
it
so
well
that
we
prolong
our
walk
on
the
level
ground
when
we
get
to
the
top
.
 
<EOS>
at
Barnet
there
be
other
horse
wait
for
us
,
but
as
they
have
only
just
be
feed
,
we
have
to
wait
for
them
too
,
and
get
a
long
fresh
walk
over
a
common
and
an
old
battle
-
field
before
the
carriage
come
up
.
 
<EOS>
these
delay
so
protract
the
journey
that
the
short
day
be
spend
and
the
long
night
have
close
in
before
we
come
to
St
Albans
,
near
to
which
town
Bleak
House
be
,
we
know
.
   
<EOS>
by
that
time
we
be
so
anxious
and
nervous
that
even
Richard
confess
,
as
we
rattle
over
the
stone
of
the
old
street
,
to
feel
an
irrational
desire
to
drive
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
Ada
and
me
,
whom
he
have
wrap
up
with
great
care
,
the
night
be
sharp
and
frosty
,
we
tremble
from
head
to
foot
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
turn
out
of
the
town
,
round
a
corner
,
and
Richard
tell
us
that
the
post
-
boy
,
who
have
for
a
long
time
sympathize
with
our
heighten
expectation
,
be
look
back
and
nod
,
we
both
stand
up
in
the
carriage
(
Richard
hold
Ada
lest
she
should
be
jolt
down
)
and
gaze
round
upon
the
open
country
and
the
starlight
night
for
our
destination
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
light
sparkle
on
the
top
of
a
hill
before
us
,
and
the
driver
,
point
to
it
with
his
whip
and
cry
,
"
that
be
Bleak
House
!
"
put
his
horse
into
a
canter
and
take
us
forward
at
such
a
rate
,
uphill
though
it
be
,
that
the
wheel
send
the
road
drift
fly
about
our
head
like
spray
from
a
water
-
mill
.
<EOS>
presently
we
lose
the
light
,
presently
see
it
,
presently
lose
it
,
presently
see
it
,
and
turn
into
an
avenue
of
tree
and
canter
up
towards
where
it
be
beam
brightly
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
a
window
of
what
seem
to
be
an
old
-
fashioned
house
with
three
peak
in
the
roof
in
front
and
a
circular
sweep
lead
to
the
porch
.
 
<EOS>
a
bell
be
ring
as
we
draw
up
,
and
amidst
the
sound
of
its
deep
voice
in
the
still
air
,
and
the
distant
barking
of
some
dog
,
and
a
gush
of
light
from
the
open
door
,
and
the
smoking
and
steaming
of
the
heated
horse
,
and
the
quicken
beating
of
our
own
heart
,
we
alight
in
no
inconsiderable
confusion
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ada
,
my
love
,
Esther
,
my
dear
,
you
be
welcome
.
 
<EOS>
I
rejoice
to
see
you
!
 
<EOS>
Rick
,
if
I
have
a
hand
to
spare
at
present
,
I
would
give
it
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
the
gentleman
who
say
these
word
in
a
clear
,
bright
,
hospitable
voice
have
one
of
his
arm
round
Ada
's
waist
and
the
other
round
mine
,
and
kiss
us
both
in
a
fatherly
way
,
and
bear
us
across
the
hall
into
a
ruddy
little
room
,
all
in
a
glow
with
a
blaze
fire
.
<EOS>
here
he
kiss
us
again
,
and
open
his
arm
,
make
us
sit
down
side
by
side
on
a
sofa
ready
draw
out
near
the
hearth
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
that
if
we
have
be
at
all
demonstrative
,
he
would
have
run
away
in
a
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
Rick
!

say
he
.
 
<EOS>

I
have
a
hand
at
liberty

a
word
in
earnest

as
good
as

I
be
heartily
glad
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
You
be
at
home

warm
yourself

"
   
<EOS>
Richard
shake
him
by
both
hand
with
an
intuitive
mixture
of
respect
and
frankness
,
and
only
say
(
though
with
an
earnestness
that
rather
alarm
me
,
I
be
so
afraid
of
Mr
Jarndyce
's
suddenly
disappear
)
,
"
You
be
very
kind
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
We
be
very
much
oblige
to
you
!
"
<EOS>
lay
aside
his
hat
and
coat
and
come
up
to
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
how
do
you
like
the
ride
?
 
<EOS>
and
how
do
you
like
Mrs
Jellyby
,
my
dear
?
"
say
Mr
Jarndyce
to
Ada
.
   
<EOS>
while
Ada
be
speak
to
him
in
reply
,
I
glance
(
I
need
not
say
with
how
much
interest
)
at
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
handsome
,
lively
,
quick
face
,
full
of
change
and
motion
;
and
his
hair
be
a
silvered
iron
-
grey
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
him
to
be
nearer
sixty
than
fifty
,
but
he
be
upright
,
hearty
,
and
robust
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
moment
of
his
first
speak
to
us
his
voice
have
connect
itself
with
an
association
in
my
mind
that
I
could
not
define
;
but
now
,
all
at
once
,
a
something
sudden
in
his
manner
and
<EOS>
a
pleasant
expression
in
his
eye
recall
the
gentleman
in
the
stagecoach
six
year
ago
on
the
memorable
day
of
my
journey
to
Reading
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
certain
it
be
he
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
be
so
frightened
in
my
life
as
when
I
make
the
discovery
,
for
he
catch
my
glance
,
and
appear
to
read
my
thought
,
give
such
a
look
at
the
door
that
I
think
we
have
lose
him
.
   
<EOS>
however
,
I
be
happy
to
say
he
remain
where
he
be
,
and
ask
me
what
I
think
of
Mrs
Jellyby
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
exert
herself
very
much
for
Africa

"
I
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
nobly

return
Mr
Jarndyce

but
you
answer
like

"
We
rather

say
I
,
glance
at
Richard
and
Ada

who
entreat
me
with
their

to
speak

unmindful
of
her

Mr

well

I
want

have
send

"
We
think
that

perhaps
,
"
say
I
,
hesitating
,
"
it
be
right
to
begin
with
the
obligation
of

no

.
 
<EOS>
all
he
say
be
so
free
from
effort
and
spontaneous
and
be
say
with
such
a
captivating
gaiety
that
it
be
fascinating
to
hear
him
talk
.
 
<EOS>
be
of
a
more
slend
figure
than
Mr
Jarndyce
and
have
a
rich
complexion
,
with
browner
hair
,
he
look
young
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
have
more
the
appearance
in
all
respect
of
a
damage
young
man
than
a
well
-
preserve
elderly
one
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
easy
negligence
in
his
manner
and
even
in
his
dress
(
his
hair
carelessly
disposed
,
and
his
neckkerchief
loose
and
flow
,
as
I
have
see
artist
paint
their
own
portrait
)
<EOS>
which
I
could
not
separate
from
the
idea
of
a
romantic
youth
who
have
undergo
some
unique
process
of
depreciation
.
 
<EOS>
It
strike
me
as
be
not
at
all
like
the
manner
or
appearance
of
a
man
who
have
advance
in
life
by
the
usual
road
of
year
,
care
,
and
experience
.
   
<EOS>
I
gather
from
the
conversation
that
Mr
Skimpole
have
be
educate
for
the
medical
profession
and
have
once
live
,
in
his
professional
capacity
,
in
the
household
of
a
german
prince
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
us
,
however
,
that
as
he
have
always
be
a
mere
child
in
point
of
weight
and
measure
and
have
never
know
anything
about
them
(
except
that
they
disgust
him
)
,
he
have
never
be
able
to
prescribe
with
the
requisite
accuracy
of
detail
.
 
<EOS>
in
fact
,
he
say
,
he
have
no
head
for
detail
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
tell
us
,
with
great
humour
,
that
when
he
be
want
to
bleed
the
prince
or
physic
any
of
his
people
,
he
be
generally
find
lie
on
his
back
in
bed
,
read
the
newspaper
or
make
fancy
-
sketch
in
pencil
,
and
could
not
come
.
<EOS>
the
prince
,
at
last
,
object
to
this
,
"
in
which
,
"
say
Mr
Skimpole
,
in
the
frank
manner
,
"
he
be
perfectly
right
,
"
the
engagement
terminate
,
and
<EOS>
Mr
Skimpole
have
(
as
he
add
with
delightful
gaiety
)
"
<EOS>
nothing
to
live
upon
but
love
,
fall
in
love
,
and
marry
,
and
surround
himself
with
rosy
cheek
.
"
 
<EOS>
His
good
friend
Jarndyce
and
some
other
of
his
good
friend
then
help
him
,
in
quick
or
slow
succession
,
to
several
opening
in
life
,
but
to
no
purpose
,
for
he
must
confess
to
two
of
the
old
infirmity
in
the
world
:
one
be
that
he
have
no
idea
of
time
,
the
other
that
he
have
no
idea
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
which
he
never
keep
an
appointment
,
never
could
transact
any
business
,
and
never
know
the
value
of
anything
!
 
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
so
he
have
get
on
in
life
,
and
here
he
be
!
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
fond
of
read
the
paper
,
very
fond
of
make
fancy
-
sketch
with
a
pencil
,
very
fond
of
nature
,
very
fond
of
art
.
 
<EOS>
all
he
ask
of
society
be
to
let
him
live
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
not
much
.
 
<EOS>
His
want
be
few
.
 
<EOS>
give
him
the
paper
,
conversation
,
music
,
mutton
,
coffee
,
landscape
,
fruit
in
the
season
,
a
few
sheet
of
Bristol
-
board
,
and
a
little
claret
,
and
he
ask
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
mere
child
in
the
world
,
but
he
do
not
cry
for
the
moon
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
to
the
world
,
"
go
your
several
way
in
peace
!
 
<EOS>
wear
red
coat

only

let
Harold
Skimpole
live
!
"
   
<EOS>
all
this
and
a
great
deal
<EOS>
more
he
tell
us
,
not
only
with
the
utmost
brilliancy
and
enjoyment
,
but
with
a
certain
vivacious
candour
---
 
speak
of
himself
as
if
he
be
not
at
all
his
own
affair
,
as
if
Skimpole
be
a
third
person
,
as
if
he
know
that
Skimpole
have
his
singularity
but
still
have
his
claim
too
,
which
be
the
general
business
of
the
community
and
must
not
be
slight
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
quite
enchanting
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
feel
at
all
confuse
at
that
early
time
in
endeavour
to
reconcile
anything
he
say
with
anything
I
have
think
about
the
duty
and
accountability
of
life
(
which
I
be
far
from
sure
of
)
,
I
be
confuse
by
not
exactly
understand
why
he
be
free
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
be
free
of
them
,
I
scarcely
doubt
;
he
be
so
very
clear
about
it
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
covet
nothing
,
"
say
Mr
Skimpole
in
the
same
light
way
.
<EOS>
"
possession
be
nothing
to
me

<EOS>
here
be
my
friend
Jarndyce

excellent
house

feel
obliged
to
him
for
possess
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
sketch
it
and
alter
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
set
it
to
music

<EOS>
when
I
be
here
,
I
have
sufficient
possession

have
neither

My

can
not

me

We
have

Mrs
Jellyby

be
a
bright

eyed
woman
,
of
a
strong
will
and
immense
power
of
business
detail
,
who
throw
herself
into
object
with
surprising
ardour
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
regret
that
I
have
not
a
strong
will
and
an
immense
power
of
business
detail
to
throw
myself
into
object
with
surprising
ardour
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
admire
her
without
envy
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
sympathize
with
the
object
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
dream
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
lie
down
on
the
grass
---
in
fine
weather
---
and
float
along
an
african
river
,
embrace
all
the
native
I
meet
,
as
sensible
of
the
deep
silence
and
sketch
the
dense
overhang
tropical
growth
as
accurately
as

I
be
there

I
do
not

that
it

of
any
direct
use
my
doing
so
,
but
it
be
all
I
can
do
,
and
I
do
it
thoroughly
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
for
heaven
's
sake
,
have
Harold
Skimpole
,
a
confide
child
,
petition
you
,
the
world

an
agglomeration

practical
people

to
let
him
live

admire
the

do
it
somehow

good

ride

"
   
<EOS>
It
be
plain
enough
that
Mr
Jarndyce
have
not
be
neglectful
of
the
adjuration
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Skimpole
's
general
position
there
would
have
render
it
so
without
the
addition
of
what
he
presently
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
only
you
,
the
generous
creature
,
whom
I
envy
,
"
say
Mr
Skimpole
,
address
us
,
his
new
friend
,
in
an
impersonal
manner
.
<EOS>
"
I
envy
you
your
power
of
do
what
you
do

<EOS>
It
be
what
I
should
revel
in
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
feel
any
vulgar
gratitude
to
you

I
almost
feel
as
if
you
ought
to
be
grateful
to
me
for
give
you
the
opportunity

enjoy
the
luxury
of
generosity

I
know

anything
I
can
tell

I
may
have
come
into
the
world
expressly
for
the
purpose

increase
your
stock
of
happiness

I
may
have
be
bear
to
be
a
benefactor
to
you
by
sometimes
give
you
an
opportunity
of
assist
me
in
my
little
perplexity
.
 
<EOS>
why
should
I
regret
my
incapacity
for
detail
and
worldly
affair
when
it
lead
to
such
pleasant
consequence
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
regret
it
therefore
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
of
all
his
playful
speech
(
playful
,
yet
always
fully
mean
what
they
express
)
none
seem
to
be
more
to
the
taste
of
Mr
Jarndyce
than
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
new
temptation
,
afterwards
,
to
wonder
whether
it
be
really
singular
,
or
only
singular
to
me
,
that
he
,
who
be
probably
the
most
grateful
of
mankind
upon
the
least
occasion
,
should
so
desire
to
escape
the
gratitude
of
other
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
all
enchant
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
it
a
merited
tribute
to
the
engage
quality
of
Ada
and
Richard
that
Mr
Skimpole
,
see
them
for
the
first
time
,
should
he
so
unreserved
and
should
lay
himself
out
to
be
so
exquisitely
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
They
(
and
especially
Richard
)
be
naturally
pleased
;
for
similar
reason
,
and
consider
it
no
common
privilege
to
be
so
freely
confide
in
by
such
an
attractive
man
.
<EOS>
the
more
we
listen
,
the
more
gaily
Mr
Skimpole
talk
.
 
<EOS>
and
what
with
his
fine
hilarious
manner
and
his
engage
candour
and
his
genial
way
of
lightly
toss
his
own
weakness
about
,
as
if
he
have
say
,
"
I
be
a
child
,
you
know
!
 
<EOS>
You
be
design
people
compare
with
me
"
(
he
really
make
me
consider
myself
in
that
light
)
"
<EOS>
but
I
be
gay
and
innocent
;
forget
your
worldly
art
and
play
with
me
!
"
<EOS>
the
effect
be
absolutely
dazzling
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
so
full
of
feel
too
and
have
such
a
delicate
sentiment
for
what
be
beautiful
or
tender
that
he
could
have
win
a
heart
by
that
alone
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
evening
,
when
I
be
prepare
to
make
tea
and
Ada
be
touch
the
piano
in
the
adjoining
room
and
softly
hum
a
tune
to
her
cousin
Richard

which
they
have
happen
to
mention
,
he
come
and
sit
down
on
the
sofa
near
me

so
speak
of
Ada
that
I
almost
love
him
.

"
She
be
like
the
morning

"
with
that
golden
hair

those
blue
eye
,
and
that
fresh
bloom
on
her
cheek

she
be
like
the
summer
morning

<EOS>
the
bird
here
will
mistake
her
for
it

<EOS>
We
will
not
call
such
a
lovely
young
creature
as
that
,
who
be
a
joy
to
all

an
orphan

I
find
,

near

attentive

You
know

have
your

at

there
should
be
no
bramble

sordid
reality

a
path

strew
with
rose

perpetual
summer

should
never

should
never

it

<EOS>
Mr
Jarndyce
pat
him
on
the
head
with
a
smile
,
as
if
he
have
be
really
a
child
,
and
pass
a
step
or
two
on
,
and
stop
a
moment
,
glance
at
the
young
cousin
.
 
<EOS>
His
look
be
thoughtful
,
but
have
a
benignant
expression
in
it
which
I
often
(
how
often
!
)
<EOS>
see
again
,
which
have
long
be
engraven
on
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
the
room
in
which
they
be
,
communicate
with
that
in
which
he
stand
,
be
only
light
by
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Ada
sit
at
the
piano
;
Richard
stand
beside
her
,
bend
down
.
 
<EOS>
upon
the
wall
,
their
shadow
blend
together
,
surround
by
strange
form
,
not
without
a
ghostly
motion
catch
from
the
unsteady
fire
,
though
reflect
from
motionless
object
.
<EOS>
Ada
touch
the
note
so
softly
and
sing
so
low
that
the
wind
,
sigh
away
to
the
distant
hill
,
be
as
audible
as
the
music
.
<EOS>
the
mystery
of
the
future
and
the
little
clue
afford
to
it
by
the
voice
of
the
present
seem
express
in
the
whole
picture
.
   
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
to
recall
this
fancy
,
well
as
I
remember
it
,
that
I
recall
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
first
,
I
be
not
quite
unconscious
of
the
contrast
in
respect
of
meaning
and
intention
between
the
silent
look
direct
that
way
and
the
flow
of
word
that
have
precede
it
.
<EOS>
secondly
,
though
Mr
Jarndyce
's
glance
as
he
withdraw
it
rest
for
but
a
moment
on
me
,
I
feel
as
if
in
that
moment
he
confide
to
me
---
 
and
know
that
he
confide
to
me
and
that
I
receive
the
confidence
 
---
his
hope
that
Ada
and
Richard
may
one
day
enter
on
a
dearer
relationship
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Skimpole
could
play
on
the
piano
and
the
violoncello
,
and
he
be
a
composer
---
<EOS>
have
compose
half
an
opera
once
,
but
get
tired
of
it
---
and
play
what
he
compose
with
taste
.
 
<EOS>
after
tea
we
have
quite
a
little
concert
,
in
which
Richard
---
who
be
enthral
by
Ada
's
singing
and
tell
me
that
she
seem
to
know
all
the
song
that
ever
be
write
---
and
Mr
Jarndyce
,
and
I
be
the
audience
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
little
while
I
miss
first
Mr
Skimpole
and
afterwards
Richard
,
and
while
I
be
think
how
could
Richard
stay
away
so
long
and
lose
so
much
,
the
maid
who
have
give
me
the
key
look
in
at
the
door
,
say
,
"
if
you
please
,
miss
,
could
you
spare
a
minute
?

<EOS>
when
I
be
shut
out
with
her
in
the
hall

she
say
,
hold
up
her
hand
,
"
oh
,
if
you

Mr
Carstone

maid

<EOS>
I
be
apprehensive
that
his
illness
may
be
of
a
dangerous
kind
,
<EOS>
but
of
course
I
beg
her
to
be
quiet
and
not
disturb
any
one
and
collect
myself
,
as
I
follow
her
quickly
upstairs
,
sufficiently
to
consider
what
be
the
good
remedy
to
be
apply
if
it
should
prove
to
be
a
fit
.
 
<EOS>
She
throw
open
a
door
<EOS>
and
I
go
into
a
chamber
,
where
,
to
my
unspeakable
surprise
,
instead
of
find
Mr
Skimpole
stretch
upon
the
bed
or
prostrate
on
the
floor
,
I
find
him
stand
before
the
fire
smile
at
Richard
,
while
Richard
,
with
a
face
of
great
embarrassment
,
look
at
a
person
on
the
sofa
,
in
a
white
great
-
coat
,
with
smooth
hair
upon
his
head
and
not
much
of
it
,
which
he
be
wipe
smooth
and
make
less
of
with
a
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Summerson

Richard
hurriedly
,

I
be
glad

Mr

with
his

candour

I

the
person
on
the
sofa

appear
to
have
a
cold
in

such
a
very
loud
snort
that
he
startle
me

I
inquire
of
Mr

it
sound
---
<EOS>
somehow
it
sound
,
"
say
Mr
Skimpole
,
"
like
a
small
sum

"
   
<EOS>
the
strange
man
say
nothing

make
another
snort
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
such
a
powerful
one

it
seem
quite
to
lift
him
out

aside

I
venture
to
inquire

generally
,
before
reply

what
would
happen

the
money
be
not

<EOS>
"
Jail

<EOS>
Richard

I
look
at

another

<EOS>
It
be
a
most
singular
thing
that
the
arrest
be
our
embarrassment

not
Mr
Skimpole
's

He
observe
us
with
a
genial
interest

there
seem
,
if
I
may
venture
on
such
a
contradiction
,
nothing
selfish
in
it

<EOS>
He
have
entirely
wash
his

it

become
ours

<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
the
business
name

I
suppose
there
be
some
instrument
within
their
power

would
settle
this
?

<EOS>
"
not
a

on

the
strange
man
.
   
<EOS>
"
really
?

return
Mr
Skimpole
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
seem
odd
,
now
,
to
one
who
be
no
judge
of

odd

even

"
<EOS>
Mr

gently
reason
with
him
as
he
make
a
little
drawing
of
his
head
on
the
fly

leaf
of
a
book

<EOS>
"
do
not

ruffle
by

<EOS>
We
can
separate

we

separate
the
individual
from
the
pursuit

<EOS>
We
be
not
so
prejudiced

to
suppose
that
in

you
be
otherwise

deal
of
poetry

you
may
not

<EOS>
the
stranger
only
answer
with
another
violent
snort

whether
in
acceptance
of
the
poetry

tribute

in
disdainful
rejection
of
it

"

Mr

innocently

confidingly

look
at

drawing

head
on

side

"
My

Richard
in
a
whisper
,
"
I
have
ten
pound
that
I

<EOS>
I
possess
fifteen
pound

odd
shilling
,
which
I
have
save
from
my
quarterly
allowance
during
several
year

<EOS>
I
have
always
think
that
some
accident
may
happen
which
would
throw
me
suddenly
,
without
any
relation
or
any
property
,
on
the
world

have
always
try
to
keep
some
little
money
by
me
that
I
may
not

quite
penniless

<EOS>
I
tell
Richard
of
my
have
this
little
store

have
no
present
need
of
it
,
and
I
ask
him
delicately
to
inform
Mr
Skimpole
,
while
I
should
be
go
to
fetch
it

that
we
would
have
the
pleasure

pay
his

when
I
come
back

Mr

kiss
my
hand

seem
quite
touch
.
 
<EOS>
not
on
his
own
account
(
I
be
again
aware
of
that
perplexing
and
extraordinary
contradiction
)
,
but
on
ours
,
as
if
personal
consideration
be
impossible
with
him
and
the
contemplation
of
our
happiness
alone
affect
him
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
,
beg
me
,
for
the
great
grace
of
the
transaction
,
as
he
say
,
to
settle
with
coavinse
(
as
Mr
Skimpole
now
jocularly
call
him
)
,
I
count
out
the
money
and
receive
the
necessary
acknowledgment
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
too
,
delighted
Mr

<EOS>
His
compliment
be
so
delicately
administer

I
blush
less

I
may
have
do

settle
with
the

in
the
white
coat
without
make
any
mistake

He
put
the
money
in

to
this

"
Harold

Coavinses

whose
doggedness
in
utterly
renounce
the
idea
be
of
that
intense
kind
that
he
could
only
give
adequate
expression
to
it
by
put
a
long
interval
between
each
word
,

accompany
the
last
with
a
jerk
that
may
have
dislocate
his
neck

very
odd

very
curious

good

<EOS>
as
our
absence
have
be
long
enough
already
to
seem
strange
downstair
,
I
return
at
once
and
find
Ada
sit
at
work
by
the
fireside
talk
to
her
cousin
John
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Skimpole
presently
appear
,
and
Richard
shortly
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sufficiently
engage
during
the
remainder
of
the
evening
in
take
my
first
lesson
in
backgammon
from
Mr
Jarndyce
,
who
be
very
fond
of
the
game
and
from
whom
I
wish
of
course
to
learn
it
as
quickly
as
I
could
in
order
that
I
may
be
of
the
very
small
use
of
be
able
to
play
when
he
have
no
well
adversary
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
think
,
occasionally
,
when
Mr
Skimpole
play
some
fragment
of
his
own
composition
or
when
,
both
at
the
piano
and
the
violoncello
,
and
at
our
table
,
he
preserve
with
an
absence
of
all
effort
his
delightful
spirit
and
his
easy
flow
of
conversation
,
that
Richard
and
I
seem
to
retain
the
transfer
impression
of
have
be
arrest
since
dinner
and
that
it
be
very
curious
altogether
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
late
before
we
separate
,
for
when
Ada
be
go
at
eleven
o'clock
,
Mr
Skimpole
go
to
the
piano
and
rattle
hilariously
that
the
good
of
all
way
to
lengthen
our
day
be
to
steal
a
few
hour
from
night
,
<EOS>
my
dear
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
past
twelve
before
he
take
his
candle
and
his
radiant
face
out
of
the
room
,
and
I
think
he
may
have
keep
us
there
,
if
he
have
see
fit
,
until
daybreak
.
 
<EOS>
Ada
and
Richard
be
linger
for
a
few
moment
by
the
fire
,
wonder
whether
Mrs
Jellyby
have
yet
finish
her
dictation
for
the
day
,
when
Mr

have
be
out

rub
his

walk
about

humoured
vexation

He
peep
in

with

before
we
have
light
our

,
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
have
be
look
at

cock

I
find
it

false
alarm
about

<EOS>
and
go
away
singe
to
himself

<EOS>
Ada
and
<EOS>
I
agree
,
as
we
talk
together
for
a
little
while
upstairs
,
that
this
caprice
about
the
wind
be
a
fiction
and
that
he
use
the
pretence
to
account
for
any
disappointment
he
could
not
conceal
,
rather
than
he
would
blame
the
real
cause
of
it
or
disparage
or
depreciate
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
We
think
this
very
characteristic
of
his
eccentric
gentleness
and
of
the
difference
between
him
and
those
petulant
people
who
make
the
weather
and
the
wind
(
particularly
that
unlucky
wind
which
he
have
choose
for
such
a
different
purpose
)
<EOS>
the
stalking
-
horse
of
their
splenetic
and
gloomy
humour
.
   
<EOS>
indeed
,
so
much
affection
for
him
have
be
add
in
this
one
evening
to
my
gratitude
that
I
hope
I
already
begin
to
understand
him
through
that
mingle
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
any
seem
inconsistency
in
Mr
Skimpole
or
in
Mrs
Jellyby
<EOS>
I
could
not
expect
to
be
able
to
reconcile
,
have
so
little
experience
or
practical
knowledge
.
<EOS>
neither
do
I
try
,
for
my
thought
be
busy
when
I
be
alone
,
with
Ada
and
Richard
and
with
the
confidence
<EOS>
I
have
seem
to
receive
concern
them
.
 
<EOS>
My
fancy
,
make
a
little
wild
by
the
wind
perhaps
,
would
not
consent
to
be
all
unselfish
,
either
,
though
I
would
have
persuade
it
to
be
so
if
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
It
wander
back
to
my
godmother
's
house
and
come
along
the
intervene
track
,
raise
up
shadowy
speculation
which
have
sometimes
tremble
there
in
the
dark
as
to
what
knowledge
<EOS>
Mr
Jarndyce
have
of
my
early
history
---
even
as
to
the
possibility
of
his
be
my
father

though
that
idle
dream
be
quite
go
now

<EOS>
It
be
all
go
now

I
remember

get
up
from

<EOS>
It

me
to
muse
over
bygone

to
act
with
a
cheerful
spirit

a
grateful
heart

so
I
say
to
myself
,
"
<EOS>
esther

Esther

give

it

still
wet
weather
down

<EOS>
the
rain
be
ever
fall

drip

drip

the
weather
be
so
very
bad
down
in

that
the

scarcely
apprehend
its
ever

fine
again

<EOS>
not
that
there

would
not

it

but
be
in
Paris
with
my
Lady

and
solitude
,
with
dusky
wing
,
sit
brood
upon
Chesney
Wold
.
   
<EOS>
there
may
be
some
motion
of
fancy
among
the
low
animal
at
Chesney
Wold
.
 
<EOS>
the
horse
in
the
stable
---
the
long
stable
in
a
barren
,
red
-
brick
court
-
yard
,
where
there
be
a
great
bell
in
a
turret
,
and
a
clock
with
a
large
face
,
which
the
pigeon
who
live
near
it
and
who
love
to
perch
upon
its
shoulder
seem
to
be
always
consult
<EOS>
---
they
may
contemplate
some
mental
picture
of
fine
weather
on
occasion
,
and
may
be
well
artist
at
them
than
the
groom
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
roan
,
so
famous
for
cross
-
country
work
,
turn
his
large
eyeball
to
the
grate
window
near
his
rack
,
may
remember
the
fresh
leave
that
glisten
there
at
other
time
and
the
scent
that
stream
in
,
and
may
have
a
fine
run
with
the
hound
,
while
the
human
helper
,
clear
out
the
next
stall
,
never
stir
beyond
his
pitchfork
and
birch

broom
.
 
<EOS>
the
grey
,
whose
place
be
opposite
the
door
and
who
with
an
impatient
rattle
of
his
halter
prick
his
ear
and
turn
his
head
so
wistfully
when
it
be
open
,
and
to
whom
the
opener
say
,
"
Woa
grey
,
then
,
steady
!
 
<EOS>
Noabody
want
you
to

day

"
may
know
it
quite
as
well
as
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
seemingly
monotonous
and
uncompanionable
half
-
dozen
,
stable
together
,
may
pass
the
long
wet
hour
when
the
door
be
shut
in
lively
communication
than
be
hold
in
the
servant

or
at
the
Dedlock

beguile

by
improve
(
perhaps
corrupt

<EOS>
the
pony
in
the
loose

box
in
the
corner
.
   
<EOS>
so
the
mastiff
,
doze
in
his
kennel
in
the
court
-
yard
with
his
large
head
on
his
paw
,
may
think
of
the
hot
sunshine
when
the
shadow
of
the
stable
-
building
tire
his
patience
out
by
change
and
leave
him
at
one
time
of
the
day
no
broad
refuge
than
the
shadow
of
his
own
house
,
where
he
sit
on
end
,
pant
and
growl
short
,
and
very
much
want
something
to
worry
besides
himself
and
his
chain
.
 
<EOS>
so
now
,
half
-
waking
and
all
-
winking
,
he
may
recall
the
house
full
of
company
,
the
coach
-
house
full
of
vehicle
<EOS>
,
the
stable
fall
of
horse
,
and
the
out
-
building
full
of
attendant
upon
horse
,
until
he
be
undecided
about
the
present
and
come
forth
to
see
how
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
with
that
impatient
shake
of
himself
,
he
may
growl
in
the
spirit
,
"
rain
,
rain
,
rain
!
 
<EOS>
nothing
but
rain
---
and
no
family
here

"
<EOS>
as
he
go
in
again
and
lie
down
with
a
gloomy
yawn
.
   
<EOS>
so
with
the
dog
in
the
kennel
-
building
across
the
park
,
who
have
their
resfless
fit
and
whose
doleful
voice
when
the
wind
have
be
very
obstinate
have
even
make
it
know
in
the
house
itself
---
 
upstairs
,
downstairs
,
and
in
my
Lady
's
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
hunt
the
whole
country

side
,
while
the
raindrop
be
patter
round
their
inactivity

<EOS>
so
the
rabbit
with
their
self
-
betray
tail
,
frisk
in
and
out
of
hole
at
root
of
tree
,
may
be
lively
with
idea
of
the
breezy
day
when
their
ear
be
blow
about

of
those
season
of
interest
when
there
be
sweet
young

gnaw

<EOS>
the
turkey
in
the
poultry
-
yard
,
always
troubled
with
a
class

grievance
(
probably
Christmas
)
,
may
be
reminiscent
of
that
summer
morning
wrongfully
take
from
him

get
into

lane
among
the
fell

<EOS>
the
discontent
goose

who
stoop

pass
under

old
gateway
,
twenty
foot
high

may
gabble
out
,
if
we
only
know
it
,
a
waddle
preference
for
weather
when
the
gateway
cast
its
shadow
on
the
ground
.
   
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
may

there
be
not

stir
at
Chesney
Wold

<EOS>
if
there
be
a
little
at
any
odd
moment

it
go

like
a

noise
in

old
echoing
place

a
long
way
and
usually
lead
off
to
ghost

mystery

<EOS>
It
have
rain
so
hard

rain
so
long
down
in

that
Mrs

have
several

Mrs

sufficiently

that
she

rather
deaf

believe

She

handsome

She
seat
herself
in

:
"
in

wicked
day

my

,
of
King

I
mean
,
of
course

in
the
wicked

themselves
against

Sir

be
the
owner

whether
there

any
account

a
ghost

I
can
not
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
think
it
very
likely
indeed

"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Rouncewell
hold
this
opinion
because
she
consider
that
a
family
of
such
antiquity
and
importance
have
a
right
to
a
ghost
.
<EOS>
She
regard
a
ghost
as
one
of
the
privilege

the
upper
class

a
genteel
distinction
to
which
the
common
people

no

I
have
no

have
none

favour
the
bad

It

that
she
be
in

that
she

when

a
Multitude
of

<EOS>
It
be
interesting
when
I
dress
before
daylight
to
peep
out
of
window
,
where
my
candle
be
reflect
in
the
black
pane
like
two
beacon
,
and
find
all
beyond
still
enshroud
in
the
indistinctness
of
last
night
,
to
watch
how
it
turn
out
when
the
day
come
on
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
prospect
gradually
reveal
itself
and
disclose
the
scene
over
which
the
wind
have
wander
in
the
dark
,
like
my
memory
over
my
life
,
I
have
a
pleasure
in
discover
the
unknown
object
that
have
be
around
me
in
my
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
they
be
faintly
discernible
in
the
mist
,
and
above
them
the
later
star
still
glimmer
.
 
<EOS>
that
pale
interval
over
,
the
picture
begin
to
enlarge
and
fill
up
so
fast
that
at
every
new
peep
I
could
have
find
enough
to
look
at
for
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
imperceptibly
my
candle
become
the
only
incongruous
part
of
the
morning
,
the
dark
place
in
my
room
all
melt
away
,
and
the
day
shine
bright
upon
a
cheerful
landscape
,
prominent
in
which
<EOS>
the
old
Abbey
Church
,
with
its
massive
tower
,
throw
a
soft
train
of
shadow
on
the
view
than
seem
compatible
with
its
rugged
character
.
 
<EOS>
but
so
from
rough
outside
<EOS>
(
I
hope
I
have
learn
)
,
serene
and
gentle
influence
often
proceed
.
   
<EOS>
every
part
of
the
house
be
in
such
order
,
and
every
one
be
so
attentive
to
me
,
that
I
have
no
trouble
with
my
two
bunche
of
key
,
though
what
with
try
to
remember
the
content
of
each
little
store
-
room
drawer
and
cupboard
;
and
what
with
make
note
on
a
slate
about
jam
,
and
pickle
,
and
preserve
,
and
bottle
,
and
glass
,
and
china
,
and
a
great
many
other
thing
;
and
what
with
be
generally
a
methodical
,
old
-
maidish
sort
of
foolish
little
person
,
I
be
so
busy
that
I
could
not
believe
it
be
breakfast
-
time
when
I
hear
the
bell
ring
.
 
<EOS>
away
I
run
,
however
,
and
make
tea
,
as
I
have
already
be
instal
into
the
responsibility
of
the
tea
-
pot
;
and
then
,
as
they
be
all
rather
late
and
nobody
be
down
yet
,
I
think
I
would
take
a
peep
at
the
garden
and
get
some
knowledge
of
that
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
it
quite
a
delightful
place
<EOS>
---
in
front
,
the
pretty
avenue
and
drive
by
which
we
have
approach
(
and
where
,
by
the
by
,
we
have
cut
up
the
gravel
so
terribly
with
our
wheel
that
I
ask
the
gardener
to
roll
it
)
;
at
the
back
,
the
flower
-
garden
,
with
my
darling
at
her
window
up
there
,
throw
it
open
to
smile
out
at
me
,
as
if
she
would
have
kiss
me
from
that
distance
.
 
<EOS>
beyond
the
flower
-
garden
be
a
kitchen
-
garden
,
and
then
a
paddock
,
and
then
a
snug
little
rick
-
yard
,
and
then
a
dear
little
farm

yard
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
house
itself
,
with
its
three
peak
in
the
roof
;
its
various
-
shaped
window
,
some
so
large
,
some
so
small
,
and
all
so
pretty
;
its
trellis
-
work
,
against
the
southfront
for
rose
and
honey
-
suckle
,
and
its
homely
,
comfortable
,
welcome
look

it
be
,
as
Ada
say
when
she
come
out
to
meet
me
with
her
arm
through
that
of
its
master
,
worthy
of
her
cousin
John

a
bold
thing
to
say

though
he
only
pinch
her
dear
cheek

it

<EOS>
Mr

be
as
agreeable
at
breakfast

have
be
overnight

there
be
honey
on
the
table

it
lead
him
into
a
discourse

bee

<EOS>
He
have
no
objection

honey

,
he
say
(
and
I
should
think
he
have
not
,
for
he
seem
to
like
it
)
,
but
he
protest
against
the
overweening
assumption
of
bee
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
at
all
see
why
the
busy
bee
should
be
propose
as
a
model
to
him
;
he
suppose
the
bee
like
to
make
honey
,
or
he
would
not
do
it
---
 
<EOS>
nobody
ask
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
necessary
for
the
bee
to
make
such
a
merit
of
his
taste
.
 
<EOS>
if
every
confectioner
go
buzz
about
the
world
bang
against
everything
that
come
in
his
way
and
egotistically
call
upon
everybody
to
take
notice
that
he
be
go
to
his
work
and
must
not
be
interrupt
,
the
world
would
be
quite
an
unsupportable
place
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
after
all
,
it
be
a
ridiculous
position
to
be
smoke
out
of
your
fortune
with
brimstone
as
soon
as
you
have
make
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
have
a
very
mean
opinion
of
a
Manchester
man
if
he
spin
cotton
for
no
other
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
say
he
think
a
drone
the
embodiment
of
a
pleasanter
and
wise
idea
.
<EOS>
the
drone
say
unaffectedly
,
"
You
will
excuse
me
;
I
really
can
not
attend
to
the
shop
!
 
<EOS>
I
find
myself
in
a
world
in
which
there
be
so
much
to
see
and
so
short
a
time
to
see
it
in
that
I
must
take
the
liberty
of
look
about
me
and
beg
to
be
provide
for
by
somebody
who
do
not
want
to
look
about
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
appear
to
Mr
Skimpole
to
be
the
drone
philosophy
,
and
he
think
it
a
very
good
philosophy
,
always
suppose
the
drone
to
be
willing
to
be
on
good
term
with
the
bee
,
which
,
so
far
as
he
know
,
the
easy
fellow
always
be
,
if
the
consequential
creature
would
only
let
him
,
and
not
be
so
conceited
about
his
honey
!
   
<EOS>
He
pursue
this
fancy
with
the
light
foot
over
a
variety
of
ground
and
make
us
all
merry
,
<EOS>
though
again
he
seem
to
have
as
serious
a
meaning
in
what
he
say
as
he
be
capable
of
have
.
 
<EOS>
I
leave
them
still
listen
to
him
when
I
withdraw
to
attend
to
my
new
duty
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
occupy
me
for
some
time
,
and
I
be
pass
through
the
passage
on
my
return
with
my
basket
of

on
my
arm
when
Mr
Jarndyce
call
me
into
a
small
room
next
his
bed
-
chamber
,
which
I
find
to
be
in
part
a
little
library
of
book
and
paper
and
in
part
quite
a
little
museum
of
his
boot

shoe
and
hat

box
.
   
<EOS>
"

I
could
not

I
try
very
hard

be
alone
with
that
benevolent
presence

meet
his

happy

He

I
almost

with
an

out

turn

I

at

it

of

I
say
nothing

I
fear

<EOS>
He
draw
my
hand
through
his
arm
and
we
go
away
to
look
for
Ada
.
<EOS>
from
that
hour
I
feel
quite
easy
with
him
,
quite
unreserved
,
quite
content
to
know
no
more
,
quite
happy
.
   
<EOS>
We
live
,
at
first
,
<EOS>
rather
a
busy
life
at
Bleak
House
,
for
we
have
to
become
acquainted
with
many
resident
in
and
out
of
the
neighbourhood
who
know
Mr
Jarndyce
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
Ada
and
me
that
everybody
know
him
who
want
to
do
anything
with
anybody
else
's
money
.
 
<EOS>
It
amaze
us
when
we
begin
to
sort
his
letter
and
to
answer
some
of
them
for
him
in
the
growlery
of
a
morning
to
find
how
the
great
object
of
the
life
of
nearly
all
his
correspondent
appear
to
be
to
form
themselves
into
committee
for
get
in
and
lay
out
money
.
 
<EOS>
the
lady
be
as
desperate
as
the
gentleman
;
indeed
,
I
think
they
be
even
more
so
.
 
<EOS>
They
throw
themselves
into
committee
in
the
most
impassioned
manner
and
collect
subscription
with
a
vehemence
quite
extraordinary
.
 
<EOS>
It
appear
to
us
that
some
of
them
must
pass
their
whole
life
in
deal
out
subscription

the
whole

<EOS>
They

They

they

they

Their
object
be
as
various
as
their
demand

<EOS>
They
be
go
to
raise
new
building
,
they
be
go
to
pay
off
debt
on
old
building
,
they
be
go

a
picturesque

(

the
Sisterhood

Mediaeval

present

<EOS>
whose
deep
devotion
to
him
be
well
know
,
they
be
go
to
get
up
everything
<EOS>
,
I
really
believe
,
from
five
hundred
thousand
tract
to
an
annuity
and
from
a
marble
monument
to
a
silver
tea
-
pot
.
 
<EOS>
They
take
a
multitude
of
title
.
<EOS>
They
be
the
Women
of
England
,
the
Daughters
of
Britain
,
the
Sisters
of
all
the
cardinal
virtue
separately
,
the
Females
of
America
,
the
Ladies
of
a
hundred
denomination
.
 
<EOS>
They
appear
to
be
always
excited
about
canvass
and
electing
.
 
<EOS>
They
seem
to
our
poor
wit
,
and
accord
to
their
own
account
,
to
be
constantly
poll
people
by
ten
of
thousand
,
yet
never
bring
their
candidate
in
for
anything
.
 
<EOS>
It
make
our
head
ache
to
think
,
on
the
whole
,
what
feverish
live
they
must
lead
.
   
<EOS>
among
the
lady
who
be
most
distinguished
for
this
rapacious
benevolence
(
if
I
may
use
the
expression
)
be
a
Mrs
Pardiggle
,
who
seem
,
as
I
judge
from
the
number
of
her
letter
to
Mr
Jarndyce
,
to
be
almost
as
powerful
a
correspondent
as
Mrs
Jellyby
herself
.
<EOS>
We
observe
that
the
wind
always
change
when
Mrs
Pardiggle
become
the
subject
of
conversation
and
that
it
invariably
interrupt
Mr
Jarndyce
and
prevent
his
go
any
farther
,
when
he
have
remark
that
there
be
two
class
of
charitable
people
;
one
,
the
people
who
do
a
little
and
make
a
great
deal
of
noise
;
the
other
,
the
people
who
do
a
great
deal
and
make
no
noise
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
therefore
curious
to
see
Mrs
Pardiggle
,
suspect
her
to
be
a
type
of
the
former
class
,
and
be
glad
when
she
call
one
day
with
her
five
young
son
.
   
<EOS>
She
be
a
formidable
style
of
lady
with
spectacle
,
a
prominent
nose
,
and
a
loud
voice
,
who
have
the
effect
of
want
a
great
deal
of
room
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
really
do
,
for
she
knock
down
little
chair
with
her
skirt
<EOS>
that
be
quite
a
great
way
off
.
 
<EOS>
as
only
Ada
and
I
be
at
home
,
we
receive
her
timidly
,
for
she
seem
to
come
in
like
cold
weather
and
to
make
the
little
Pardiggles
blue
as
they
follow
.

suppose
Mr

dinner

"
You

Mrs

<EOS>
We
be
glad
to
change
the

go
to
the

point
out
the
beauty

"
   
<EOS>
this
be
really
such
a
confusing
question
that
Ada
look
at
me
in
perfect
dismay

<EOS>
as
to
the
guilty
nature
of
my
own
consciousness
after
what
I
have

,
it
must
have
be
express
in
the
colour
of
my
cheek

<EOS>
"
find
out
,
I
mean
,
"
say
Mrs
Pardiggle
,
"
the
prominent
point
in
my
character
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
aware
that
it
be
so
prominent
as
to
be
discoverable
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
I
lie
myself
open
to
detection
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
I
freely
admit
,
I
be
a
woman
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
hard
work
;
I
enjoy
hard
work
.
 
<EOS>
the
excitement
do
me
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
accustomed
and
inure
to
hard
work
that
I
do
not
know
what
fatigue
be
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
We
murmur
that
it
be
very
astonishing
and
very
gratifying
,
or
something
to
that
effect
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
we
know
what
it
be
either
,
but
this
be
what
our
politeness
express
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
what
it
be
to
be
tired
;
you
can
not
tire
me
if
you
try
!
"
say
Mrs
Pardiggle
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
quantity
of
exertion
(
which
be
no
exertion
to
me
)
,
the
amount
of
business
(
which
I
regard
as
nothing
)
,
that
I
go
through
sometimes
astonish
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
my
young
family
,
and
Mr
Pardiggle
,
quite
wear
out
with
witness
it

when
I
may
truly
say
I
have
be
as
fresh
as
a
lark

"
   
<EOS>
if
that
dark
-
visaged
eld
boy
could
look
more
malicious
than
he
have
already
look
,
this
be
the
time
when
he
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
observe
that
he
double
his
right
fist
and
deliver
a
secret
blow
into
the
crown
of
his
cap
,
which
be
under
his

give
me
a

advantage

"
if
I
find
a
person
unwilling

I
be
incapable

fatigue

I
have
do

"
 
<EOS>
It
answer
admirably
!
 
<EOS>
Miss
Summerson
,
I
hope
I
shall
have
your
assistance
in
my
visit
round
immediately
,
and
Miss
Clare
's
very
soon
.
"
   
<EOS>
at
first
I
try
to
excuse
myself
for
the
present
on
the
general
ground
of
have
occupation
to
attend
to
which
I
must
not
neglect
.
<EOS>
but
as
this
be
an
ineffectual
protest
,
I
then
say
,
more
particularly
,
that
I
be
not
sure
of
my
qualification
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
be
inexperienced
in
the
art
of
adapt
my
mind
to
mind
very
differently
situate
,
and
address
them
from
suitable
point
of
view
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
have
not
that
delicate
knowledge
of
the
heart
which
must
be
essential
to
such
a
work
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
have
much
to
learn
,
myself
,
before
I
could
teach
other
,
and
that
I
could
not
confide
in
my
good
intention
alone
.
 
<EOS>
for
these
reason
I
think
it
best
to
be
as
useful
as
I
could
,
and
to
render
what
kind
service
<EOS>
I
could
to
those
immediately
about
me
,
and
to
try
to
let
that
circle
of
duty
gradually
and
naturally
expand
itself
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
I
say
with
anything
but
confidence
,
because
Mrs
Pardiggle
be
much
old
than
I
,
and
have
great
experience
,
and
be
so
very
military
in
her
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
wrong
,
Miss
Summerson
,
"
say
she
,
"
<EOS>
but
perhaps
you
be
not
equal
to
hard
work
or
the
excitement
of
it
,
and
that
make
a
vast
difference
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
would
like
to
see
how
I
go
through
my
work
,
I
be
now
about
---
with
my
young
family
---
to
visit
a
brickmaker
in
the
neighbourhood
(
a
very
bad
character
)
and
shall
be
glad
to
take
you
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Clare
also
,
if
she
will
do
me
the
favour
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Ada
and
I
interchange
look
,
and
as
we
be
go
out
in
any
case
,
accept
the
offer
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
hastily
return
from
put
on
our
bonnet
,
we
find
the
young
family
languish
in
a
corner
and
Mrs
Pardiggle
sweep
about
the
room
,
knock
down
nearly
all
the
light
object
it
contain
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Pardiggle
take
possession
of
Ada
,
and
I
follow
with
the
family
.
   
<EOS>
Ada
tell
me
afterwards
that
Mrs
Pardiggle
talk
in
the
same
loud
tone
(
that
,
indeed
,
I
overhear
)
<EOS>
all
the
way
to
the
brickmaker
be
about
an
exciting
contest
which
she
have
for
two
or
three
year
wage
against
another
lady
relative
to
the
bringing
in
of
their
rival
candidate
for
a
pension
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
quantity
of
printing
,
and
promising
,
and
proxye
,
and
polling
,
and
it
appear
to
have
impart
great
liveliness
to
all
concern
,
except
the
pensioner
---
who
be
not
elect
yet
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
very
fond
of
be
confide
in
by
child
and
be
happy
in
be
usually
favour
in
that
respect
,
but
on
this
occasion
it
give
me
great
uneasiness
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
be
out
of
door
,
Egbert
,
with
the
manner
of
a
little
footpad
,
demand
a
shilling
of
me
on
the
ground
that
his
pocket
-
money
be
"
bone
"
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
on
my
pointing
out
the
great
impropriety
of
the
word
,
especially
in
connexion
with
his
parent
(
for
he
add
sulkily
"
by
her
!
"
)
,
he
pinch
me
and
say
,
"
<EOS>
oh
,
then
!
 
<EOS>
now
!
 
<EOS>
who
be
you
!
 
<EOS>
you
would
not
like
it
,
I
think
?
 
<EOS>
what
do
she
make
a
sham
for
,
and
pretend
to
give
me
money
,
and
take
it
away
again
?
 
<EOS>
why
do
you
call
it
my
allowance
,
and
never
let
me
spend
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
these
exasperating
question
so
inflame
his
mind
and
the
mind
of
Oswald
and
Francis
that
they
all
pinch
me
at
once
,
and
in
a
dreadfully
expert
way
---
 
screw
up
such
little
piece
of
my
arm
that
I
could
hardly
forbear
cry
out
.
 
<EOS>
Felix
,
at
the
same
time
,
stamp
upon
my
toe
.
<EOS>
and
the
Bond
of
Joy
,
who
on
account
of
always
have
the
whole
of
his
little
income
anticipate
stand
in
fact
pledge
to
abstain
from
cake
as
well
as
tobacco
,
so
swell
with
grief
and
rage
when
we
pass
a
pastry
-
cook
's
shop
that
he
terrify
me
by
become
purple
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
undergo
so
much
,
both
in
body
and
mind
,
in
the
course
of
a
walk
with
young
people
as
from
these
unnaturally
constrain
child
when
they
pay
me
the
compliment
of
be
natural
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
glad
when
we
come
to
the
brickmaker
's
house
,
though
it
be
one
of
a
cluster
of
wretched
hovel
in
a
brick
-
field
,
with
pigsty
close
to
the
broken
window
and
miserable
little
garden
before
the
door
grow
nothing
but
stagnant
pool
.
 
<EOS>
here
and
there
an
old
tub
be
put
to
catch
the
dropping
of
rain
-
water
from
a
roof
,
or
they
be
bank
up
with
mud
into
a
little
pond
like
a
large
dirt
-
pie
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
door
and
window
some
man
and
woman
lounge
or
prowl
about
,
and
take
little
notice
of
us
except
to
laugh
to
one
another
or
to
say
something
as
we
pass
about
gentlefolk
mind
their
own
business
and
not
trouble
their
head
and
muddy
their
shoe
with
come
to
look
after
other
people
's
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Pardiggle
,
lead
the
way
with
a
great
show
of
moral
determination
and
talk
with
much
volubility
about
the
untidy
habit
of
the
people
<EOS>
(
though
I
doubt
if
the
good
of
us
could
have
be
tidy
in
such
a
place
)
,
conduct
us
into
a
cottage
at
the
farth
corner
,
the
ground
-
floor
room
of
which
we
nearly
fill
.
<EOS>
besides
ourselves
,
there
be
in
this
damp
,
offensive
room
<EOS>
a
woman
with
a
black
eye
,
nurse
a
poor
little
gasping
baby
by
the
fire
;
a
man
,
all
stain
with
clay
and
mud
and
look
very
dissipated

lie
at
full
length
on
the
ground
,
smoke
a
pipe
;
a
powerful
young
man
fasten
a
collar
on
a
dog
;
and
a
bold
girl
do
some
kind
of
washing
in
very
dirty
water
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
look
up
at
us
as
we
come
in
,
and
the
woman
seem
to
turn
her
face
towards
the
fire
as
if
to
hide
her
bruise
eye

nobody
give
us
any
welcome

Mrs

her

systematic

I'da
be
drunk
four
if
I'da
have
the
money

<EOS>
do
not
I
never
mean
for
to
go
to
church
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
I
do
not
never
mean
for
to
go
to
church

<EOS>
I
should
not
be
expect
there

if
I
do
;
the
beadle
be
too
gen

teel
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
how
do
my
wife
get
that
black
eye
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
I
give
it
her
;
and
if
she
say
I
do
not
,
she
be
a
lie
!

<EOS>
He
have
pull
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
to
say
all
this
,
and
he
now
turn
over
on
his
other
side
and
smoke
again
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Pardiggle
,
who
have
be
regard
him
through
her
spectacle
with
a
forcible
composure
,
calculate
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
help
think
,
to
increase
his
antagonism
,
pull
out
a
good
book
as
if
it
be
a
constable
's
staff
and
take
the
whole
family
into
custody
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
into
religious
custody
,
of
course
;
but
she
really
do
it
as
if
she
be
an
inexorable
moral
policeman
carry
them
all
off
to
a
station
-
house
.
   
<EOS>
Ada
and
I
be
very
uncomfortable
.
 
<EOS>
We
both
feel
intrusive
and
out
of
place
,
and
we
both
think
that
Mrs
Pardiggle
would
have
get
on
infinitely
better
if
she
have
not
have
such
a
mechanical
way
of
take
possession
of
people
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
sulk
and
stare
;
the
family
take
no
notice
of
us
<EOS>
whatever
,
except
when
the
young
man
make
the
dog
bark
,
which
he
usually
do
when
Mrs
Pardiggle
be
most
emphatic
.
 
<EOS>
We
both
feel
painfully
sensible
that
between
us
and
these
people
there
be
an
iron
barrier
which
could
not
be
remove
by
our
new
friend
.
 
<EOS>
by
whom
or
how
it
could
be
remove
,
we
do
not
know
,
but
we
know
that
.
 
<EOS>
even
what
she
read
and
say
seem
to
us
to
be
ill
-
choose
for
such
auditor
,
if
it
have
be
impart
ever
so
modestly
and
with
ever
so
much
tact
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
little
book
to
which
the
man
on
the
floor
have
refer
,
we
acqulre
a
knowledge
of
it
afterwards
,
and
Mr
Jarndyce
say
he
doubt
if
Robinson
Crusoe
could
have
read
it
,
though
he
have
have
no
other
on
his
desolate
island
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
much
relieved
,
under
these
circumstance
,
when
Mrs
Pardiggle
leave
off
.
   
<EOS>
the
man
on
the
floor
,
then
turn
his
bead
round
again
,
say
morosely
,
"
well
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
do
,
have
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
for
to
-
day
,
I
have
,
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
never
fatigue
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
come
to
you
again
in
your
regular
order
,
"
return
Mrs
Pardiggle
with
demonstrative
cheerfulness
.
   
<EOS>
"
so
long
as
you
go
now
,
"
say
he
,
fold
his
arm
and
shut
his
eye
with
an
oath
,
"
you
may
do
wot
you
like
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Pardiggle
accordingly
rise
and
make
a
little
vortex
in
the
confined
room
from
which
the
pipe
itself
very
narrowly
escape
.
<EOS>
take
one
of
her
young
family
in
each
hand
,
and
tell
the
other
to
follow
closely
,
and
express
her
hope
that
the
brickmaker
and
all
his
house
would
be
improve
when
she
see
them
next
,
she
then
proceed
to
another
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
be
not
unkind
in
me
to
say
that
she
certainly
do
make
,
in
this
as
in
everything
else
,
a
show
that
be
not
conciliatory
of
do
charity
by
wholesale
and
of
deal
in
it
to
a
large
extent
.
   
<EOS>
She
suppose
that
we
be
follow
her
,
but
as
soon
as
the
space
be
leave
clear
,
we
approach
the
woman
sit
by
the
fire
to
ask
if
the
baby
be
ill
.
   
<EOS>
She
only
look
at
it
as
it
lie
on
her
lap
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
observe
before
that
<EOS>
when
she
look
at
it
she
cover
her
discoloured
eye
with
her
hand
,
as
though
she
wish
to
separate
any
association
with
noise
and
violence
and
ill
treatment
from
the
poor
little
child
.
   
<EOS>
Ada
,
whose
gentle
heart
be
move
by
its
appearance
,
bend
down
to
touch
its
little
face
.
 
<EOS>
as
she
do
so
,
I
see
what
happen
and
draw
her
back
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
die
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Esther
!
"
cry
Ada
,
sink
on
her
knee
beside
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
look
here
!
 
<EOS>
oh
,
Esther
,
my
love
,
the
little
thing
!
 
<EOS>
the
suffering
,
quiet
,
pretty
little
thing
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
sorry
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
sorry
for
the
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
a
sight
so
pitiful
as
this
before
!
<EOS>
oh
,
baby
,
baby
!
"
   
<EOS>
such
compassion
,
such
gentleness
,
as
that
with
which
she
bend
down
weeping
and
put
her
hand
upon
the
mother
's
may
have
soften
any
mother
's
heart
that
ever
beat
.
 
<EOS>
the
woman
at
first
gaze
at
her
in
astonishment
and
then
burst
into
tear
.
   
<EOS>
presently
I
take
the
light
burden
from
her
lap
,
do
what
I
could
to
make
the
baby
's
rest
the
pretty
and
gentle
,
lay
it
on
a
shelf
,
and
cover
it
with
my
own
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
We
try
to
comfort
the
mother
,
and
we
whisper
to
her
what
Our
Saviour
say
of
child
.
<EOS>
She
answer
nothing
,
but
sit
weeping
---
weep
very
much
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
turn
,
I
find
that
the
young
man
have
take
out
the
dog
and
be
stand
at
the
door
look
in
upon
us
with
dry
eye
,
but
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
the
girl
be
quiet
too
and
sit
in
a
corner
look
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
have
rise
.
 
<EOS>
He
still
smoke
his
pipe
with
an
air
of
defiance
,
but
he
be
silent
.
   
<EOS>
an
ugly
woman
,
very
poorly
clothe
,
hurry
in
while
I
be
glance
at
them
,
and
come
straight
up
to
the
mother
,
say
,
"
Jenny
!
<EOS>
Jenny
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
mother
rise
on
be
so
address
and
fall
upon
the
woman
's
neck
.
   
<EOS>
She
also
have
upon
her
face
and
arm
the
mark
of
ill
usage
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
no
kind
of
grace
about
her
,
but
the
grace
of
sympathy
;
but
when
she
condole
with
the
woman
,
and
her
own
tear
fall
,
she
want
no
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
condole
,
but
her
only
word
be
"
Jenny
!
 
<EOS>
Jenny
!
<EOS>
"
all
the
rest
be
in
the
tone
in
which
she
say
them
.
   
<EOS>
I
think
it
very
touching
to
see
these
two
woman
,
coarse
and
shabby
and
beat
,
so
united
;
to
see
what
they
could
be
to
one
another
;
to
see
how
they
feel
for
one
another
,
how
the
heart
of
each
to
each
be
soften
by
the
hard
trial
of
their
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
the
good
side
of
such
people
be
almost
hide
from
us
.
 
<EOS>
what
the
poor
be
to
the
poor
be
little
known
,
except
to
themselves
and
God
.
   
<EOS>
We
feel
it
well
to
withdraw
and
leave
them
uninterrupted
.
 
<EOS>
We
steal
out
quietly
and
without
notice
from
any
one
except
the
man
.
<EOS>
He
be
lean
against
the
wall
near
the
door
,
and
find
that
there
be
scarcely
room
for
us
to
pass
,
go
out
before
us
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
to
want
to
hide
that
he
do
this
on
our
account
,
but
we
perceive
that
be
do
,
and
thank
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
no
answer
.
   
<EOS>
Ada
be
so
full
of
grief
all
the
way
home
,
and
Richard
,
whom
we
find
at
home
,
be
so
distressed
to
see
her
in
tear
(
though
he
say
to
me
,
when
she
be
not
present
,
how
beautiful
it
be
too
!
)
,
that
we
arrange
to
return
at
night
with
some
little
comfort
and
repeat
our
visit
at
the
brick
-
maker
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
We
say
as
little
as
we
could
to
Mr
Jarndyce
,
but
the
wind
change
directly
.
   
<EOS>
Richard
accompany
us
at
night
to
the
scene
of
our
morning
expedition
.
 
<EOS>
on
our
way
there
,
we
have
to
pass
a
noisy
drinking
-
house
,
where
a
number
of
man
be
flock
about
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
among
them
,
and
prominent
in
some
dispute
,
be
the
father
of
the
little
child
.
 
<EOS>
at
a
short
distance
,
we
pass
the
young
man
and
the
dog
,
in
congenial
company
.
 
<EOS>
the
sister
be
stand
laugh
and
talk
with
some
other
young
woman
at
the
corner
of
the
row
of
cottage
,
but
she
seem
ashamed
and
turn
away
as
we
go
by
.
   
<EOS>
We
leave
our
escort
within
sight
of
the
brickmaker
's
dwelling
and
proceed
by
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
the
door
,
we
find
the
woman
who
have
bring
such
consolation
with
her
stand
there
look
anxiously
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
you
,
young
lady
,
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
in
a
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
a
-
watch
for
my
master

<EOS>
My
heart
be
in
my
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
be
to
catch
me
away
from
home
,
he
would
pretty
near
murder
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
your

say
I.

yes

She
be
scarcely
have
the
child
off
her
lap
,
poor
thing
,
these
seven
day
and
night
,
except
when
I
have
be
able
to
take
it
for
a
minute
or
two
.
"
   
<EOS>
as
she
give
way
for
us
,
she
go
softly
in
and
put
what
we
have
bring
near
the
miserable
bed
on
which
the
mother
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
no
effort
have
be
make
to
clean
the
room
---
it
seem
in
its
nature
almost
hopeless
of
be
clean
;
but
the
small
waxen
form
from
which
so
much
solemnity
diffuse
itself
have
be
compose
afresh
,
and
wash
,
and
neatly
dress
in
some
fragment
of
white
linen
;
and
on
my
handkerchief
,
which
still
cover
the
poor
baby
,
a
little
bunch
of
sweet
herb
have
be
lay
by
the
same
rough
,
scar
hand
,
so
lightly
,
so
tenderly
!
   
<EOS>
"
May
heaven
reward
you
!
"
<EOS>
we
say
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
good
woman
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Me
,
young
lady

<EOS>
"
she
return
with
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
 
<EOS>
Jenny
,
Jenny
!
"
   
<EOS>
the
mother
have
moan
in
her
sleep
and
move
.
 
<EOS>
the
sound
of
the
familiar
voice
seem
to
calm
her
again
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
quiet
once
more
.
   
<EOS>
how
little
I
think
,
when
I
raise
my
handkerchief
to
look
upon
the
tiny
sleeper
underneath
and
seem
to
see
a
halo
shine
around
the
child
through
Ada
's
drooping
hair
as
her
pity
bend
her
head
---
 
<EOS>
how
little
I
think
in
whose
unquiet
bosom
that
handkerchief
would
come
to
lie
after
cover
the
motionless
and
peaceful
breast
!
 
<EOS>
I
only
think
that
perhaps
the
Angel
of
the
child
may
not
be
all
unconscious
of
the
woman
who
replace
it
with
so
compassionate
a
hand
;
not
all
unconscious
of
her
presently
,
when
we
have
take
leave
,
and
leave
her
at
the
door
,
by
turn
look
,
and
listen
in
terror
for
herself
,
and
say
in
her
old
soothing
manner
,
"
Jenny

Jenny

sign
and
token
 
I
do
not
know
how
it
be
I
seem
to
be
always
write
about
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
all
the
time
to
write
about
other
people
,
and
I
try
to
think
about
myself
as
little
as
possible
,
and
I
be
sure
,
when
I
find
myself
come
into
the
story
again
,
I
be
really
vexed
and
say
,
"
dear
,
dear
,
you
tiresome
little
creature
,
I
wish
you
would
not
!
"
<EOS>
but
it
be
all
of
no
use

<EOS>
I
hope
any
one
who
may
read
what
I
write
will
understand
that
if
these
page
contain
a
great
deal
about
me
,
I
can
only
suppose
it
must
be
because
I
have
really
something
to
do
with
them
and
can
not

keep
out
.
   
<EOS>
My
darling
and
<EOS>
I
read
together
,
and
work
,
and
practise
,
and
find
so
much
employment
for
our
time
that
the
winter
day
fly
by
us
like
bright
-
winged
bird
.
 
<EOS>
generally
in
the
afternoon
,
and
always
in
the
evening
,
Richard
give
us
his
company
.
 
<EOS>
although
he
be
one
of
the
most
restless
creature
in
the
world
,
he
certainly
be
very
fond
of
our
society
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
very
,
very
,
very
fond
of
Ada
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
it
,
and
<EOS>
I
have
better
say
it
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
see
any
young
people
fall
in
love
before
,
but
I
find
them
out
quite
soon
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
say
so
,
of
course
,
or
show
that
I
know
anything
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
I
be
so
demure
and
use
to
seem
so
unconscious
that
sometimes
I
consider
within
myself
while
I
be
sit
at
work
whether
I
be
not
grow
quite
deceitful
.
   
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
help
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
all
I
have
to
do
be
to
be
quiet
,
and
I
be
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
as
quiet
as
mouse
too
,
so
far
as
any
word
be
concern
,
but
the
innocent
manner
in
which
they
rely
more
and
more
upon
me
as
they
take
more
and
more
to
one
another
be
so
charming
that
I
have
great
difficulty
in
not
show
how
it
interest
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
Our
dear
little
old
woman

such
a
capital
old
woman

"
Richard
would
say
,
come
up
to
meet
me
in
the
garden
early
,
with
his
pleasant
laugh
and
perhaps
the
least
tinge
of
a
blush
,
"
that
I
can
not
get
on
without
her
.
 
<EOS>
before
I

my

then
gallop
up
hill
and
down
dale
,
all
the
country
round
,
like
a
highwayman
<EOS>
---
it
do
me
so
much
good
to
come
and
have
a
steady
walk
with
our
comfortable
friend
,
that
here
I
be
again
!

<EOS>
"
You
know
,
Dame
Durden
,
dear
,
"
Ada
would
say
at
night
,
with
her
head
upon
my
shoulder
and
the
firelight
shine
in
her
thoughtful
eye
,
"
I
do
not
want
to
talk
when
we
come
upstairs
here
.
 
<EOS>
only
to
sit
a
little
while
think
,
with
your
dear
face
for
company
,
and
to
hear
the
wind
and
remember
the
poor
sailor
at
sea
---
<EOS>
"
   
ah
!
 
<EOS>
perhaps
Richard
be
go
to
be
a
sailor
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
talk
it
over
very
often
now
,
and
there
be
some
talk
of
gratify
the
inclination
of
his
childhood
for
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jarndyce
have
write
to
a
relation
of
the
family
,
a
great
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
,
for
his
interest
in
Richard
's
favour
,
generally
;
and
Sir
Leicester
have
reply
in
a
gracious
manner
that
he
would
be
happy
to
advance
the
prospect
of
the
young
gentleman
if
it
should
ever
prove
to
be
within
his
power
,
which
be
not
at
all
probable
,
and
that
my
Lady
send
her
compliment
to
the
young
gentleman
(
to
whom
she
perfectly
remember
that
she
be
ally
by
remote
consanguinity
)
and
trust
that
he
would
ever
do
his
duty
in
any
honourable
profession
to
which
he
may
devote
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
I
apprehend
it
be
pretty
clear
,
"
say
Richard
to
me
,
"
that
I
shall
have
to
work
my
own
way
.
 
<EOS>
never
mind
!
 
<EOS>
plenty
of
people
have
have
to
do
that
before
now
,
and
have
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
wish
I
have
the
command
of
a
clipping
privateer
to
begin
with
and
could
carry
off
the
Chancellor
and
keep
him
on
short
allowance
until
he
give
judgment
in
our
cause
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
find
himself
grow
thin
,
if
he
do
not
look
sharp
!
"
   
<EOS>
with
a
buoyancy
and
hopefulness
and
a
gaiety
that
hardly
ever
flag
,
Richard
have
a
carelessness
in
his
character
that
quite
perplex
me
,
principally
because
he
mistake
it
,
in
such
a
very
odd
way
,
for
prudence
.
 
<EOS>
It
enter
into
all
his
calculation
about
money
in
a
singular
manner
which
I
do
not
think
I
can
better
explain
than
by
revert
for
a
moment
to
our
loan
to
Mr
Skimpole
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jarndyce
have
ascertain
the
amount
,
either
from
Mr
Skimpole
himself
or
from
coavinse
,
and
have
place
the
money
in
my
hand
with
instruction
to
me
to
retain
my
own
part
of
it
and
hand
the
rest
to
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
the
number
of
little
act
of
thoughtless
expenditure
which
Richard
justify
by
the
recovery
of
his
ten
pound
,
and
the
number
of
time
he
talk
to
me
as
if
he
have
save
or
realize
that
amount
,
would
form
a
sum
in
simple
addition
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
prudent
Mother
Hubbard
,
why
not
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
say
to
me
when
he
want
,
without
the
least
consideration
,
to
bestow
five
pound
on
the
brickmaker
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
make
ten
pound
,
clear
,
out
of
Coavinses
'
business
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
how
be
that
?
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
get
rid
of
ten
pound
which
I
be
quite
content
to
get
rid
of
and
never
expect
to
see
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
deny
that
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
very
well
!
 
<EOS>
then
I
come
into
possession
of
ten
pound
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
the
same
ten
pound
,
"
I
hint
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
!
"
return
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
get
ten
pound
more
than
I
expect
to
have
,
and
consequently
I
can
afford
to
spend
it
without
be
particular
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
in
exactly
the
same
way
,
when
he
be
persuade
out
of
the
sacrifice
of
these
five
pound
by
be
convince
that
it
would
do
no
good
,
he
carry
that
sum
to
his
credit
and
draw
upon
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
let
me
see
!
"
he
would
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
save
five
pound
out
of
the
brickmaker
's
affair
,
so
if
I
have
a
good
rattle
to
London
and
back
in
a
post
-
chaise
and
put
that
down
at
four
pound
,
I
shall
have
save
one
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
a
very
good
thing
to
save
one
,
let
me
tell
you
:
a
penny
save
be
a
penny
get
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
believe
Richard
's
be
as
frank
and
generous
a
nature
as
there
possibly
can
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
ardent
and
brave
,
and
in
the
midst
of
all
his
wild
restlessness
,
be
so
gentle
that
I
know
him
like
a
brother
in
a
few
week
.
 
<EOS>
His
gentleness
be
natural
to
him
and
would
have
show
itself
abundantly
even
without
Ada
's
influence
;
but
with
it
,
he
become
one
of
the
most
win
of
companion
,
always
so
ready
to
be
interested
and
always
so
happy
,
sanguine
,
and
light
-
hearted
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
that
I
,
sit
with
them
,
and
walk
with
them
,
and
talk
with
them
,
and
notice
from
day
to
day
how
they
go
on
,
fall
deep
and
deep
in
love
,
and
say
nothing
about
it
,
and
each
shyly
think
that
this
love
be
the
great
of
secret
,
perhaps
not
yet
suspect
even
by
the
other
---
I
be
sure
that
I
be
scarcely
less
enchanted
than
they
be
and
scarcely
less
pleased
with
the
pretty
dream
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
go
on
in
this
way
,
when
one
morning
at
breakfast
Mr
Jarndyce
receive
a
letter
,
and
look
at
the
superscription
,
say
,
"
from
Boythorn
?
 
<EOS>
aye
,
aye
!
"
and
open
and
read
it
with
evident
pleasure
,
announce
to
us
in
a
parenthesis
when
he
be
about
half
-
way
through
,
that
Boythorn
be
"
come
down
"
on
a
visit
.
<EOS>
now
who
be
Boythorn
,
we
all
think
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
dare
say
we
all
think
too
---
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
do
,
for
one
---
would
boythorn
at
all
interfere
with
what
be
go
forward
?
   
<EOS>
"
I
go
to
school
with
this
fellow

Lawrence

say
Mr
Jarndyce
,

the
letter

he
lay
it
on
the
table

more
than
five

forty
year
ago

<EOS>
He

then
the
most
impetuous

He

He

He
be
a
tremendous
fellow

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
in

"
ask
Richard
.
   
<EOS>
"
pretty
well

Rick

in
that
respect

say
Mr
Jarndyce
;
"
be
some
ten
year
old

I

a

of

tall

with
his

old

his
stalwart

square

his

there

no

as
Mr

enjoy
the
image
of
his

the
favourable
oman

be
not

indication

it

His

as
sound

<EOS>
He
be
always
in
extreme
,
perpetually
in
the
superlative
degree
.
<EOS>
in
his
condemnation
he
be
all
ferocity

<EOS>
You
may
suppose
him
to
be
an
ogre
from
what
he
say

I
believe
he
have
the
reputation
of
one
with
some
people

<EOS>
there
!
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
no
more

him
beforehand

<EOS>
You
must
not

surprised
to
see
him
take
me
under
his
protection

for
he
have
never

that
I
be
a
low
boy
at
school

that

friendship
begin
in
his
knock
two

I
take

the
necessary
preparation

for
Mr

suddenly
burst
open

with

far

hope

by
my
life

honour

yes

cry
the
visitor

<EOS>

I
would
not
be
guilty
of

audacious
insolence

keep
a

thus

presently

thunder

ha

again

ha

the
flat
echo
in
the
neighbourhood
seem
to
catch
the
contagion
and
to
laugh
as
enjoyingly
as
he
do
or
as
we
do
when
we
hear
him
laugh

<EOS>
We
all
conceive
a
prepossession
in
his
favour
,
for
there
be
a
sterling
quality
in
this
laugh
,
and
in
his
vigorous
,
healthy
voice
,
and
in
the
roundness
and
fullness
with
which
he
utter
every
word
he
speak
,
and
in
the
very
fury
of
his
superlative
,
which
seem
to
go
off
like
blank
cannon
and
hurt
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
be
hardly
prepared
to
have
it
so
confirm
by
his
appearance
when
Mr
Jarndyce
present
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
only
a
very
handsome
old
gentleman
---
upright
and
stalwart
as
he
have
be
describe
to
us
---
 
with
a
massive
grey
head
,
a
fine
composure
of
face
when
silent
,
a
figure
that
may
have
become
corpulent
but
for
his
be
so
continually
in
earnest
that
he
give
it
no
rest
,
and
a
chin
that
may
have
subside
into
a
double
chin
but
for
the
vehement
emphasis
in
which
it
be
constantly
require
to
assist
;
but
he
be
such
a
true
gentleman
in
his
manner
,
so
chivalrously
polite
,
his
face
be
light
by
a
smile
of
so
much
sweetness
and
tenderness
,
and
it
seem
so
plain
that
he
have
nothing
to
hide
,
but
show
himself
exactly
as
he
be
---
incapable
,
as
Richard
say
,
of
anything
on
a
limited
scale

and
fire
away
with
those
blank
great

he
smilingly
converse
with
Ada

me

be
lead
by
Mr
Jarndyce
into
some
great
volley
of
superlative

throw
up
his
head
like
a
bloodhound

out
that
tremendous
"

You

I
feel
,
from
my
guardian
's
manner
,
that
beyond
this
point
I
could
not
pursue
the
subject
without
change
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
forbore
to
ask
any
further
question
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
interested
,
but
not
curious
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
a
little
while
about
this
old
love
story
in
the
night
,
when
I
be
awaken
by
Mr
Boythorn
's
lusty
snore
;
and
I
try
to
do
that
very
difficult
thing
,
imagine
old
people
young
again
and
invest
with
the
grace
of
youth
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
fall
asleep
before
I
have
succeed
,
and
dream
of
the
day
when
I
live
in
my
godmother
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
sufficiently
acquaint
with
such
subject
to
know
whether
it
be
at
all
remarkable
that
I
almost
always
dream
of
that
period
of
my
life
.
   
<EOS>
with
the
morning
there
come
a
letter
from
Messrs.
Kenge
and
Carboy
to
Mr
Boythorn
inform
him
that
one
of
their
clerk
would
wait
upon
him
at
noon
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
the
day
of
the
week
on
which
I
pay
the
bill
,
and
add
up
my
book
,
and
make
all
the
household
affair
as
compact
as
possible
,
I
remain
at
home
while
Mr
Jarndyce
,
Ada
,
and
Richard
take
advantage
of
a
very
fine
day
to
make
a
little
excursion
,
Mr
Boythorn
be
to
wait
for
Kenge
and
Carboy
's
clerk
and
then
be
to
go
on
foot
to
meet
them
on
their
return
.
   
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
full
of
business
,
examine
tradesman
's
book
,
add
up
column
,
pay
money
,
file
receipt
,
and
I
dare
say
make
a
great
bustle
about
it
when
Mr
Guppy
be
announce
and
show
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
have
some
idea
that
the
clerk
who
be
to
be
send
down
may
be
the
young
gentleman
who
have
meet
me
at
the
coach
-
office
,
and
I
be
glad
to
see
him
,
because
he
be
associate
with
my
present
happiness
.
   
<EOS>
I
scarcely
know
him
again
,
he
be
so
uncommonly
smart
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
an
entirely
new
suit
of
glossy
clothe
on
,
a
shining
hat
,
lilac
-
kid
glove
,
a
neckerchief
of
a
variety
of
colour
,
a
large
hot
-
house
flower
in
his
button
-
hole
,
and
a
thick
gold
ring
on
his
little
finger
.
 
<EOS>
besides
which
,
he
quite
scent
the
dining
-
room
with
bear's
-
grease
and
other
perfumery
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
at
me
with
an
attention
that
quite
confuse
me
when
I
beg
him
to
take
a
seat
until
the
servant
should
return
;
and
as
he
sit
there
cross
and
uncross
his
leg
in
a
corner
,
and
I
ask
him
if
he
have
have
a
pleasant
ride
,
and
hope
that
Mr
Kenge
be
well
<EOS>
,
I
never
look
at
him
,
but
I
find
him
look
at
me
in
the
same
scrutinizing
and
curious
way
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
request
be
bring
to
him
that
he
would
go
up
-
stair
to
Mr
Boythorn
's
room
,
I
mention
that
he
would
find
lunch
prepared
for
him
when
he
come
down
,
of
which
Mr
Jarndyce
hope
he
would
partake
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
with
some
embarrassment
,
hold
the
handle
of
the
door
,
"
Shall
I
have
the
honour
of
find
you
here
,
miss
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
reply
<EOS>
yes
,
I
should
be
there
;
and
he
go
out
with
a
bow
and
another
look
.
   
<EOS>
I
think
him
only
awkward
and
shy
,
for
he
be
evidently
much
embarrassed
;
and
I
fancy
that
the
good
thing
I
could
do
would
be
to
wait
until
I
see
that
he
have
everything
he
want
and
then
to
leave
him
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
the
lunch
be
soon
bring
,
but
it
remain
for
some
time
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
the
interview
with
Mr
Boythorn
be
a
long
one
,
and
a
stormy
one
too
,
I
should
think
,
for
although
his
room
be
at
some
distance
<EOS>
I
hear
his
loud
voice
rise
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
like
a
high
wind
,
and
evidently
blow
perfect
broadside
of
denunciation
.
   
<EOS>
at
last
Mr
Guppy
come
back
,
look
something
the
bad
for
the
conference
.
 
<EOS>
"
My

"
he
say
in
a
low
voice
,
"

a
Tartar

"
   
<EOS>
"
pray
take
some
refreshment

"
say
I.
   
Mr
Guppy
sit
down
at
the
table
and
begin
nervously
sharpen
the
carving
-
knife
on
the
carving
-
fork
,
still
look
at
me
(
<EOS>
as
I
feel
quite
sure
without
look
at
him
)
in
the
same
unusual
manner
.
 
<EOS>
the
sharpening
last
so
long
that
at
last
I
feel
a
kind
of
obligation
on
me
to
raise
my
eye
in
order
that
I
may
break
the
spell
under
which
he
seem
to
labour
,
of
not
be
able
to
leave
off
.
   
<EOS>
He
immediately
look
at
the
dish
and
begin
to
carve
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
will
you
take
yourself
,
miss

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"

Mr

hurriedly
drink
off
a
glass
of

He

off
two
more
glass

one
after
another

<EOS>
I
think
I
have
better
go

<EOS>
"

"
It

<EOS>
"
I

the

slowly
up

not

Mr

Mr

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
about
that
time

I
should

observe

<EOS>
with
which
remark
he
finish
his
brief
attendance

to
finish

dinner

<EOS>
the
dark
young
surgeon
pass
the
candle
across

across

carefully
examine

who
have

He

glance
round

three
bystander

<EOS>
"
I
be
his

grimly
answer
Krook
,
take
the
candle
from
the
surgeon

outstretched
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
tell
me
once
I

<EOS>
"
He
have
die

the

of
an
over

there
be
no

the

there
be
enough
here

take
an
old
teapot
from
Mr
Krook

to
kill
a
dozen
people

"
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
think

do
it
on

ask
Krook

<EOS>
"
took
the
over

dose
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes

"
 
<EOS>
Krook
almost
smack
his
lip
with
the
unction
of
a
horrible
interest
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
think
it
unlikely
,
as
he
have
be
in
the
habit
of
take
so
much
.
 
<EOS>

nobody
can
tell
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
poor

I
suppose

<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
be

<EOS>
His
room

do
not
look
rich

say
Krook
,
who
may
have
change
eye
with
his
cat
,
as
he
cast
his
sharp
glance
around
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
have
never
be
in
it

he
have
it
,

he
be

close

name
his
circumstance

me

do
he

six

He
will
never

say
the
young
man
,
resume
his
examination
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
beyond
a
doubt
that
he
be
indeed
as
dead
as
Pharaoh
;
and
to
judge
from
his
appearance
and
condition
,
I
should
think
it
a
happy
release
.
 
<EOS>
yet
he
must
have
be
a
good
figure
when
a
youth
,
and
<EOS>
I
dare
say
,
good
-
looking
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
say
this
,
not
unfeelingly
,
while
sit
on
the
bedstead
's
edge
with
his
face
towards
that
other
face
and
his
hand
upon
the
region
of
the
heart
.
<EOS>
"
I
recollect
once
think
there
be
something
in
his
manner
,
uncouth
as
it
be
,
that
denote
a
fall
in
life

<EOS>
be
that
so

<EOS>
he
continue

look
round

Krook
reply
,
"
You
may
as
well
ask
me

during
this
dialogue
Mr
Tulkinghorn
have
stand
aloof
by

with
his
hand
behind
him

equally
remove
,
to
all
appearance
,
from
all
three
kind
of
interest
exhibit
near
the
bed
---
from
the
young
surgeon
's
professional
interest
in
death
,
noticeable
as
be
quite
apart
from
his
remark
on
the
deceased
as
an
individual
;
from
the
old
man
's
unction
;
and
the
little
crazy
woman
's
awe

<EOS>
His
imperturbable
face
have
be
as
inexpressive
as
his
rusty
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
one
could
not
even
say
he
have
be
think
all
this
while
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
show
neither
patience
nor
impatience
,
nor
attention
nor
abstraction

<EOS>
He
have
show
nothing
but
his
shell

<EOS>
as
easily
may
the
tone
of
a
delicate
musical
instrument
be
infer
from
its
case

the
tone
of
Mr

from
his
case

He
now
interpose

the
young
surgeon

unmoved

professional
way

observe

"
just
before
you

the
intention

deceased

<EOS>
I
have
hear
of

from
my
stationer

Snagsby

Cook

Court

patchwork
counterpane

as
large
as
life

as
dull

look
as
if
he
do
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
,
which
be
probably
his
general
state
of
mind
in
the
day
of
Queen
Elizabeth

<EOS>
that
evening
,
in
the
housekeeper
's
room
,
Rosa
can
do
nothing
but
murmur
Lady
Dedlock
's
praise
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
so
affable
,
so
graceful
,
so
beautiful
,
so
elegant
;
have
such
a
sweet
voice

such
a
thrilling
touch
that
Rosa
can
feel
it

Mrs

confirm
all
this

not

reserve
only
the
one
point
of
affability

<EOS>
Mrs

be

that

Heaven

of
any

excellent
family

above
all
,
of
my

a

not

Mrs

Mrs

I

He
happen
to

very
shy

<EOS>
but
accord
to
the
old
superstition

it

ear

My

Frenchwoman

from

in

southern
country
about
Avignon

Marseilles
,
a
large

eyed
brown
woman
with
black
hair
who
would
be
handsome
but
for
a
certain
feline
mouth
and
general
uncomfortable
tightness
of
face
,
render
the
jaw
too
eager
and
the
skull
too
prominent
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
indefinably
keen
and
wan
about
her
anatomy
,
and
she
have
a
watchful
way
of
look
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
without
turn
her
head
which
could
be
pleasantly
dispense
with
,
especially
when
she
be
in
an
ill
humour
and
near

<EOS>
through
all
the
good

these

besides

yet
there

<EOS>
what
can
it
be

<EOS>
dandyism
?
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
King

there

-
reproach

<EOS>
but
be
there
dandyism
in
the
brilliant
and
distinguished
circle
notwithstanding
,
dandyism
of
a
more
mischievous
sort
,
that
have
get
below

and
be
do
less
harmless
thing
than
jack

<EOS>
why
,
yes
.
 
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
disguise
.
 
<EOS>
there
are
at
Chesney
Wold
this
January
week
some
lady
and
gentleman
of
the
new
fashion
,
who
have
set
up
a
dandyism
---
in
religion
,
for
instance
.
 
<EOS>
who
in
mere
lackadaisical
want
of
an
emotion
have
agree
upon
a
little
dandy
talk
about
the
vulgar
want
faith
in
thing
in
general
,
mean
in
the
thing
that
have
be
try
and
find
want
,
as
though
a
low
fellow
should
unaccountably
lose
faith
in
a
bad
shilling
after
find
it
out
!
 
<EOS>
who
would
make
the
vulgar
very
picturesque
and
faithful
by
put
back
the
hand
upon
the
clock
of
time
and
cancel
a
few
hundred
year
of
history
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
also
lady
and
gentleman
of
another
fashion
,
not
so
new
,
but
very
elegant
,
who
have
agree
to
put
a
smooth
glaze
on
the
world
and
to
keep
down
all
its
reality
.
 
<EOS>
for
whom
everything
must
be
languid
and
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
who
have
find
out
the
perpetual
stoppage
.
 
<EOS>
who
be
to
rejoice
at
nothing
and
be
sorry
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
who
be
not
to
be
disturb
by
idea
.
 
<EOS>
on
whom
even
the
fine
art
,
attend
in
powder
and
walk
backward
like
the
Lord
Chamberlain
,
must
array
themselves
in
the
milliner
'
and
tailor
'
pattern
of
past
generation
and
be
particularly
careful
not
to
be
in
earnest
or
to
receive
any
impress
from
the
move
age
.
   
<EOS>
then
there
be
my
Lord
Boodle
,
of
considerable
reputation
with
his
party
,
who
have
know
what
office
be
and
who
tell
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
with
much
gravity
,
after
dinner
,
that
he
really
do
not
see
to
what
the
present
age
be
tend
.
 
<EOS>
a
debate
be
not
what
a
debate
use
to
be
;
the
House
be
not
what
the
House
use
to
be
;
even
a
Cabinet
be
not
what
it
formerly
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
perceive
with
astonishment
that
suppose
the
present
government
to
be
overthrow
,
the
limited
choice
of
the
Crown
,
in
the
formation
of
a
new
ministry
,
would
lie
between
Lord
Coodle
and
Sir
Thomas
Doodle
---
suppose
it
to
be
impossible
for
the
Duke
of
Foodle
to
act
with
Goodle
,
which
may
be
assume
to
be
the
case
in
consequence
of
the
breach
arise
out
of
that
affair
with
Hoodle
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
give
the
Home
Department
and
the
leadership
of
the
House
of
Commons
to
Joodle
,
the
Exchequer
to
Koodle
,
the
Colonies
to
Loodle
,
and
the
Foreign
Office
to
Moodle
,
what
be
you
to
do
with
Noodle
?
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
offer
him
the
Presidency
of
the
Council
;
that
be
reserve
for
Poodle
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
put
him
in
the
Woods
and
Forests
;
that
be
hardly
good
enough
for
Quoodle
.
 
<EOS>
what
follow
?
 
<EOS>
that
the
country
be
shipwreck
,
lose
,
and
go
to
piece
(
as
be
make
manifest
to
the
patriotism
of
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
)
because
you
can
not
provide
for
Noodle
!
   
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
the
right
honourable
William
Buffy
,
MP
,
contend
across
the
table
with
some
one
else
that
the
shipwreck
of
the
country
---
about
which
there
be
no
doubt
;
it
be
only
the
manner
of
it
that
be
in
question
---
be
attributable
to
Cuffy
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
have
do
with
Cuffy
what
you
ought
to
have
do
when
he
first
come
into
Parliament
,
and
have
prevent
him
from
go
over
to
Duffy
<EOS>
,
you
would
have
get
him
into
alliance
with
Fuffy
,
you
would
have
have
with
you
the
weight
attach
as
a
smart
debater
to
Guffy
<EOS>
,
you
would
have
bring
to
bear
upon
the
election
the
wealth
of
Huffy
,
you
would
have
get
in
for
three
county
Juffy
,
Kuffy
,
and
Luffy
,
and
you
would
have
strengthen
your
administration
by
the
official
knowledge
and
the
business
habit
of
Muffy
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
,
instead
of
be
as
you
now
be
,
dependent
on
the
mere
caprice
of
Puffy
!
   
<EOS>
as
to
this
point
,
and
as
to
some
minor
topic
,
there
be
difference
of
opinion
;
but
it
be
perfectly
clear
to
the
brilliant
and
distinguished
circle
,
all
round
,
that
nobody
be
in
question
but
Boodle
and
his
retinue
,
and
Buffy
and
his
retinue
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
the
great
actor
for
whom
the
stage
be
reserve
.
 
<EOS>
a
People
there
be
,
no
doubt
---
a
certain
large
number
of
supernumerary
,
who
be
to
be
occasionally
address
,
and
rely
upon
for
shout
and
chorus
,
as
on
the
theatrical
stage
;
but
Boodle
and
Buffy
,
their
follower
and
family
,
their
heir
,
executor
,
administrator
,
and
assign
,
be
the
bear
first
-
actor
,
manager
,
and
leader
,
and
no
other
can
appear
upon
the
scene
for
ever
and
ever
.
   
<EOS>
in
this
,
too
,
there
be
perhaps
more
dandyism
at
Chesney
Wold
than
the
brilliant
and
distinguished
circle
will
find
good
for
itself
in
the
long
run
.
 
<EOS>
for
it
be
,
even
with
the
still
and
politest
circle
,
as
with
the
circle
the
necromancer
draw
around
him
---
very
strange
appearance
may
be
see
in
active
motion
outside
.
 
<EOS>
with
this
difference
,
that
be
reality
and
not
phantom
,
there
be
the
great
danger
of
their
breaking
in
.
   
<EOS>
Chesney
Wold
be
quite
full
anyhow
,
so
full
that
a
burning
sense
of
injury
arise
in
the
breast
of
ill
-
lodge
ladies'-maids
,
and
be
not
to
he
extinguish
.
 
<EOS>
only
one
room
be
empty
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
turret
chamber
of
the
third
order
of
merit
,
plainly
but
comfortably
furnish
and
have
an
old

fashioned
business

Lady

look

renew
his
stately
protest

that
as

clear

no

possibly
be

insolent
grace

terribly
liable

death

Mr

be
always
the

speechless
repository
of
noble
confidence
,
so
oddly

of
place
and
yet
so
perfectly
at
home

<EOS>
They
appear
to
take
as
little
note
of
one
another
as
any
two
people
enclose
within

wall
could

<EOS>
but
whether
each
evermore
watch

suspect
the

evermore
mistrustful
of
some
great
reservation
;
whether

be
evermore
prepared
at

Army
,
Richard
say
he
have
think
of
that
,
too
,
and
it
be
not
a
bad
idea
.
 
<EOS>
when
Mr
Jarndyce
advise
him
to
try
and
decide
within
himself
whether
his
old
preference
for
the
sea
be
an
ordinary
boyish
inclination
or
a
strong
impulse
,
Richard
answer
,
well
he
really
HAD
try
very
often
,
and
he
could
not
make
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
how
much
of
this
indecision
of
character
,
"
Mr
Jarndyce
say
to
me
,
"
be
chargeable
on
that
incomprehensible
heap
of
uncertainty
and
procrastination
on
which
he
have
be
throw
from
his
birth
,
I
do
not
pretend
to
say
;
but
that
Chancery
,
among
its
other
sin
,
be
responsible
for
some
of
it
,
I
can
plainly
see
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
engender
or
confirm
in
him
a
habit
of
put
off
---
and
trust
to
this
,
that
,
and
the
other
chance
,
without
know
what
chance
---
and
dismiss
everything
as
unsettle
,
uncertain
,
and
confused
.
 
<EOS>
the
character
of
much
old
and
steady
people
may
be
even
change
by
the
circumstance
surround
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
too
much
to
expect
that
a
boy
's
,
in
its
formation
,
should
be
the
subject
of
such
influence
and
escape
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
feel
this
to
be
true
;
though
if
I
may
venture
to
mention
what
I
think
besides
,
I
think
it
much
to
be
regret
that
Richard
's
education
have
not
counteract
those
influence
or
direct
his
character
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
eight
year
at
a
public
school
and
have
learn
,
I
understand
,
to
make
latin
verse
of
several
sort
in
the
most
admirable
manner
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
never
hear
that
it
have
be
anybody
's
business
to
find
out
what
his
natural
bent
be
,
or
where
his
failing
lay
,
or
to
adapt
any
kind
of
knowledge
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
he
have
be
adapt
to
the
verse
and
have
learn
the
art
of
make
them
to
such
perfection
that
if
he
have
remain
at
school
until
he
be
of
age
,
I
suppose
he
could
only
have
go
on
make
them
over
and
over
again
unless
he
have
enlarge
his
education
by
forget
how
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
still
,
although
I
have
no
doubt
that
they
be
very
beautiful
,
and
very
improving
,
and
very
sufficient
for
a
great
many
purpose
of
life
,
and
always
remember
all
through
life
,
I
do
doubt
whether
Richard
would
not
have
profit
by
some
one
study
him
a
little
,
instead
of
his
study
them
quite
so
much
.
   
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
I
know
nothing
of
the
subject
and
do
not
even
now
know
whether
the
young
gentleman
of
classic
Rome
or
Greece
make
verse
to
the
same
extent
---
or
whether
the
young
gentleman
of
any
country
ever
do
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
least
idea
,
"
say
Richard
,
musing
,
"
what
I
have
better
be
.
 
<EOS>
except
that
I
be
quite
sure
I
do
not
want
to
go
into
the
Church
<EOS>
,
it
be
a
toss
-
up
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
I

<EOS>

with

<EOS>
"

it

"
   
<EOS>
He
be
not
to
be
laugh
out
of
it
,
though
he
laugh
at
it
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
he
have
choose
his
profession
,
and
the
more
he
think
of
it
,
<EOS>
the
more
he
feel
that
his
destiny
be
clear
;
the
art
of
healing
be
the
art
of
all
other
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
mistrust
that
he
only
come
to
this
conclusion
because
,
have
never
have
much
chance
of
find
out
for
himself
what
he
be
fit
for
and
have
never
be
guide
to
the
discovery
,
he
be
take
by
the
new
idea
and
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
the
trouble
of
consideration
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
whether
the
latin
verse
often
end
in
this
or
whether
Richard
's
be
a
solitary
case
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jarndyce
take
great
pain
to
talk
with
him
seriously
and
to
put
it
to
his
good
sense
not
to
deceive
himself
in
so
important
a
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
be
a
little
grave
after
these
interview
,
but
invariably
tell
Ada
and
me
that
it
be
all
right
,
and
then
begin
to
talk
about
something
else
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>

"
cry
Mr
Boythorn
,
who
interest
himself
strongly
in
the
subject
---
though
I
need
not
say
that
,
for
he
could
do
nothing
weakly

I
rejoice

I

this
may

easily

Mr

<EOS>
We
have
only
,
in
the
first
place
,
to
discover
a
sufficiently
eligible
practitioner
;
and
as
soon
as
we
make
our
want
---
and
shall
I
add
,
our
ability
to
pay
a
premium
?
---
 
<EOS>
know
,
our
only
difficulty
will
be
in
the
selection
of
one
from
a
large
number
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
only
,
in
the
second
place
,
to
observe
those
little
formality
which
be
render
necessary
by
our
time
of
life

our
being
under
the
guardianship
of

court

We
shall
soon
be
---
shall
I
say
,
in
Mr
Richard
's
own
light
-
hearted
manner
,
"
go
at
it
"

to
our
heart
's
content

<EOS>
It
be
a
coincidence
,
"
say
Mr
Kenge
with
a
tinge
of
melancholy
in
his
smile
,
"
one
of
those
coincidence
which
may
or
may
not
require
an
explanation
beyond
our
present
limited
faculty
,
that
I
have
a
cousin
in
the
medical
profession
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
be
deem
eligible
by
you
and
may
be
dispose
to
respond
to
this
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
answer
for
him
as
little
as
for
you
,
but
he
may
!
"
   
<EOS>
as
this
be
an
opening
in
the
prospect
,
it
be
arrange
that
Mr
Kenge
should
see
his
cousin
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
Mr
Jarndyce
have
before
propose
to
take
us
to
London
for
a
few
week
,
it
be
settle
next
day
that
we
should
make
our
visit
at
once
and
combine
Richard
's
business
with
it
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Boythorn
leave
us
within
a
week
,
we
take
up
our
abode
at
a
cheerful
lodging
near
Oxford
Street
over
an
upholsterer
's
shop
.
<EOS>
London
be
a
great
wonder
to
us
,
and
we
be
out
for
hour
and
hour
at
a
time
,
see
the
sight
,
which
appear
to
be
less
capable
of
exhaustion
than
we
be
.
 
<EOS>
We
make
the
round
of
the
principal
theatre
,
too
,
with
great
delight
,
and
see
all
the
play
that
be
worth
see
.
 
<EOS>
I
mention
this
because
it
be
at
the
theatre
that
I
begin
to
be
make
uncomfortable
again
by
Mr
Guppy
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
sit
in
front
of
the
box
one
night
with
Ada
,
and
Richard
be
in
the
place
he
like
best
,
behind
Ada
's
chair
,
<EOS>
when
,
happen
to
look
down
into
the
pit
,
I
see
Mr
Guppy
,
with
his
hair
flatten
down
upon
his
head
and
woe
depict
in
his
face
,
look
up
at
me
.
<EOS>
I
feel
all
through
the
performance
that
he
never
look
at
the
actor
but
constantly
look
at
me
,
and
always
with
a
carefully
prepare
expression
of
the
deep
misery
and
the
profound
dejection
.
   
<EOS>
It
quite
spoil
my
pleasure
for
that
night
because
it
be
so
very
embarrassing
and
so
very
ridiculous
.
 
<EOS>
but
from
that
time
forth
,
we
never
go
to
the
play
without
my
see
Mr
Guppy
in
the
pit
,
always
with
his
hair
straight
and
flat
,
his
shirt
-
collar
turn
down
,
and
a
general
feebleness
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
be
not
there
when
we
go
in
,
and
I
begin
to
hope
he
would
not
come
and
yield
myself
for
a
little
while
to
the
interest
of
the
scene
,
I
be
certain
to
encounter
his
languish
eye
when
I
least
expect
it
and
,
from
that
time
,
to
be
quite
sure
that
they
be
fix
upon
me
all
the
evening
.
   
<EOS>
I
really
can
not
express
how
uneasy
this
make
me
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
would
only
have
brush
up
his
hair
or
turn
up
his
collar
,
it
would
have
be
bad
enough
;
but
to
know
that
that
absurd
figure
be
always
gaze
at
me
,
and
always
in
that
demonstrative
state
of
despondency
,
put
such
a
constraint
upon
me
that
I
do
not
like
to
laugh
at
the
play
,
or
to
cry
at
it
,
or
to
move
,
or
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
I
seem
able
to
do
nothing
naturally
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
escape
Mr
Guppy
by
go
to
the
back
of
the
box
,
I
could
not
bear
to
do
that
because
I
know
Richard
and
Ada
rely
on
have
me
next
them
and
that
they
could
never
have
talk
together
so
happily
if
anybody
else
have
be
in
my
place
.
 
<EOS>
so
there
I
sit
,
not
know
where
to
look
---
for
wherever
I
look
<EOS>
,
I
know
Mr
Guppy
's
eye
be
follow
me
---
and
thinking
of
the
dreadful
expense
to
which
this
young
man
be
put
himself
on
my
account
.
   
<EOS>
sometimes
I
think
of
tell
Mr
Jarndyce
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
fear
that
the
young
man
would
lose
his
situation
and
that
I
may
ruin
him
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
think
of
confide
in
Richard
,
but
be
deter
by
the
possibility
of
his
fight
Mr
Guppy
and
give
him
black
eye
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
think
,
should
I
frown
at
him
or
shake
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
feel
I
could
not
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
I
consider
whether
I
should
write
to
his
mother
,
but
that
end
in
my
be
convince
that
to
open
a
correspondence
would
he
to
make
the
matter
bad
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
come
to
the
conclusion
,
finally
,
that
I
could
do
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Guppy
's
perseverance
<EOS>
,
all
this
time
,
not
only
produce
him
regularly
at
any
theatre
to
which
we
go
,
but
cause
him
to
appear
in
the
crowd
as
we
be
come
out
,
and
even
to
get
up
behind
our
fly
---
 
where
I
be
sure
I
see
him
,
two
or
three
time
,
struggle
among
the
most
dreadful
spike
.
 
<EOS>
after
we
get
home
,
he
haunt
a
post
opposite
our
house
.
 
<EOS>
the
upholsterer
be
where
we
lodge
be
at
the
corner
of
two
street
,
and
my
bedroom
window
be
opposite
the
post
,
I
be
afraid
to
go
near
the
window
when
I
go
upstairs
,
lest
I
should
see
him
(
as
I
do
one
moonlight
night
)
lean
against
the
post
and
evidently
catch
cold
.
 
<EOS>
if
Mr
Guppy
have
not
be
,
fortunately
for
me
,
engage
in
the
daytime
,
I
really
should
have
have
no
rest
from
him
.
   
<EOS>
while
we
be
make
this
round
of
gaiety
,
in
which
Mr
Guppy
so
extraordinarily
participate
,
the
business
which
have
help
to
bring
us
to

<EOS>
He
be
quite
willing
to
receive
Richard

it

advantageously

"
the

Captain

<EOS>
You
must
excuse
me
<EOS>
if
I
occasionally
introduce
a
nautical
expression
;
I
be
quite
a
sailor
once

<EOS>
Captain
Swosser
love
that
craft
for
my
sake

<EOS>
when
she
be
no
longer
in
commission
,
he
frequently
say
that
if
he
be
rich
enough
to
buy
her
old
hulk
,
he
would
have
an
inscription
let
into
the
timber

quarter

deck

we
stand
as
partner
in
the
dance
to

spot

rake
fore
and
aft
<EOS>
(
Captain
Swosser
use
to
say
)
by
the
fire
from
my
top
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
his
naval
way
of
mention
my
eye
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Badger
shake
her
head
,
sigh
,
and
look
in
the
glass
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
great
change
from
Captain
Swosser
to
Professor
Dingo
,
"
she
resume
with
a
plaintive
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
feel
it
a
good
deal
at
first
.
<EOS>
such
an
entire
revolution
in
my
mode
of
life

<EOS>
but
custom
,
combine
with
science

particularly
science
---
inure
me
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
be
the
professor
's
sole
companion
in
his
botanical
excursion
,
I
almost
forget
that
I
have
ever
be
afloat
,
and
become
quite
learn
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
singular
that
the
professor
be
the
antipode
of
Captain
Swosser
and
that
Mr
Badger
be
not
in
the
least
like
either
!
"
   
<EOS>
We
then
pass
into
a
narrative
of
the
death
of
Captain
Swosser
and
Professor
Dingo
,
both
of
whom
seem
to
have
have
very
bad
complaint
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
it
,
Mrs
Badger
signify
to
us
that
she
have
never
madly
love
but
once
and
that
the
object
of
that
wild
affection
,
never
to
be
recall
in
its
fresh
enthusiasm
,
be
Captain
Swosser
.
<EOS>
the
professor
be
yet
die
by
inch
in
the
most
dismal
manner
,
and
Mrs
Badger
be
give
us
imitation
of
his
way
of
say
,
with
great
difficulty
,
"
where
be
Laura
?
 
<EOS>
let
Laura
give
me
my
toast
and
water
!
"
<EOS>
when
the
entrance
of
the
gentleman
consign
him
to
the
tomb
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
I
observe
that
evening
,
as
I
have
observe
for
some
day
past
,
that
Ada
and
Richard
be
more
than
ever
attach
to
each
other
's
society
,
which
be
but
natural
,
see
that
they
be
go
to
be
separate
so
soon
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
therefore
not
very
much
surprised
when
we
get
home
,
and
Ada
and
<EOS>
I
retire
upstairs
,
to
find
Ada
more
silent
than
usual
,
though
I
be
not
quite
prepared
for
her
come
into
my
arm
and
begin
to
speak
to
me
,
with
her
face
hide
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
darling
Esther
!
"
murmured
Ada
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
great
secret
to
tell
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
a
mighty
secret
,
my
pretty
one
,
no
doubt
!
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
,
Ada
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Esther
,
you
would
never
guess
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
try
to
guess
?
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
do
not
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
do
not
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Ada
,
very
much
startle
by
the
idea
of
my
doing
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
now
,
I
wonder

too

we
sit
before
the
fire

<EOS>
I
have
all
the
talking
to
myself
for

little
while

there

of

happy

timidly

we

to
advise
us

to

perhaps
you

come

bashful
simplicity

would
have
win
my

I

be
wait
at

door

<EOS>
there
he
be
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
They
bring
a
chair
on
either
side
of
me
,
and
put
me
between
them
,
and
really
seem
to
have
fall
in
love
with
me
instead
of
one
another
,
they
be
so
confide
,
and
so
trustful
,
and
so
fond
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
go
on
in
their
own
wild
way
for
a
little
while
<EOS>
---
I
never
stop
them
;
I
enjoy
it
too
much
myself
---
 
<EOS>
and
then
we
gradually
fall
to
consider
how
young
they
be
,
and
how
there
must
be
a
lapse
of
several
year
before
this
early
love
could
come
to
anything
,
and
how
it
could
come
to
happiness
only
if
it
be
real
and
lasting
and
inspire
them
with
a
steady
resolution
to
do
their
duty
to
each
other
,
with
constancy
,
fortitude
,
and
perseverance
,
each
always
for
the
other
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
Richard
say
that
he
would
work
his
finger
to
the
bone
for
Ada
,
and
Ada
say
that
she
would
work
her
finger
to
the
bone
for
Richard
,
and
they
call
me
all
sort
of
endearing
and
sensible
name
,
and
we
sit
there
,
advise
and
talk
,
half
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
finally
,
before
we
part
,
I
give
them
my
promise
to
speak
to
their
cousin
John
to
-
morrow
.
   
<EOS>
so
,
when
to
-
morrow
come
,
I
go
to
my
guardian
after
breakfast
,
in
the
room
that
be
our
town
-
substitute
for
the
growlery
,
and
tell
him
that
I
have
it
in
trust
to
tell
him
something
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
little
woman

he
,
shut
up
his

House

in

dark
room

"
   
<EOS>
I
wish
to
call
to
his
remembrance
the
look
he
have
give
me
then
.

unless
I
be
much
mistaken
,
I
see
that
I
do
so

I
with
a
little
hesitation

<EOS>
"

he

fall
in
love

have
tell
each

cry
my
guardian
,
quite
astonished
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
!
"
say
I.
 
"
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
guardian
,
I
rather
expect
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
the
deuce
you
do
!
"
say
he
.
   
<EOS>
He
sit
consider
for
a
minute
or
two
,
with
his
smile
,
at
once
so
handsome
and
so
kind
,
upon
his
change
face
,
and
then
request
me
to
let
them
know
that
he
wish
to
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
come
,
he
encircle
Ada
with
one
arm
in
his
fatherly
way

address
himself
to
Richard
with
a
cheerful
gravity

"
Rick

Mr

"
I
be
glad
to
have
win
your

contemplate
these
relation
between
us
four
which
have
so
brighten
my
life

so
invest
it
with
new
interest
and
pleasure

I
certainly
do
contemplate

afar
off

the
possibility

you

in
a
mind

go
through

,

many
reason

make
it
desirable

afar
off

afar
off

well

now

hear
me
,
my
dear

<EOS>
I
may
tell
you
that
you
do
not
know
your
own
mind
yet

that
a
thousand
thing
may
happen
to
divert
you
from
one
another

that
it

well
this
chain

you

up

very
easily

I

not

such
wisdom
will
come
soon
enough

I
dare
say
,
if
it
be
to
come
at
all

I
will
assume
that
a

year
hence
you
will
be
in
your
heart
to
one
another
what
you
be

all

find

more

in

there

a

He

rather

I

him
very
sensible

agreeable

Ada
ask

I

his
new
career

Ada

I
be

under

,
of
all
his
labour

success

I
be

observe
how
resolute

I

I

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes

,
"
urge
Richard

answer
what
her

suggest
rather
than
her

the

the
nearer

a

now

be
not
that
reasonable

"
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
best
,
Richard

I
be
afraid

it
will
make

unhappy

<EOS>

,
my
Ada

we

not

<EOS>
cry
Richard
gaily
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
know
it
better
than
to
trust
to
it

<EOS>
We
only
say
that
if
it
SHOULD
make
us
rich
,
we
have
no
constitutional
objection
to
be
rich

<EOS>
the
court
be
,
by
solemn
settlement
of
law
,
our
grim
old
guardian
,
and
we
be
to
suppose
that
what
it
give
us
(
when
it
give
us
anything
)
be
our
right
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
necessary
to
quarrel
with
our
right
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
"

Ada
,
"

it
may
be
well
to

all
about
it

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
"
cry
Richard
,
"
then
we
will
forget
all
about

<EOS>
We
consign
the
whole
thing
to
oblivion
.
 
<EOS>
Dame

put
on

"
Dame

can
not

better

"
   
<EOS>
so
,
Richard
say
there
be
an
end
of
it
,
and
immediately
begin
,
on
no
other
foundation
,
to
build
as
many
castle
in
the

as
would
man

Great
Wall

<EOS>
He
go
away
in
high
spirit

<EOS>
Ada
and
I
,
prepare
to
miss
him
very
much
,
commence
our
quieter
career
.
   
<EOS>
on
our
arrival
in
London
,
we
have
call
with
Mr
Jarndyce
at
Mrs
Jellyby
's
but
have
not
be
so
fortunate
as
to
find
her
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
It
appear
that
she
have
go
somewhere
to
a
tea
-
drinking
and
have
take
Miss
Jellyby
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
besides
the
tea
-
drinking
,
there
be
to
be
some
considerable
speech
-
making
and
letter
-
writing
on
the
general
merit
of
the
cultivation
of
coffee
,
conjointly
with
native
,
at
the
Settlement
of
Borrioboola
-
Gha
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
involve
,
no
doubt
,
sufficient
active
exercise
of
pen
and
ink
to
make
her
daughter
's
part
in
the
proceeding
anything
but
a
holiday
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
now
beyond
the
time
appoint
for
Mrs
Jellyby
's
return
,
we
call
again
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
in
town
,
but
not
at
home
,
have
go
to
Mile
End
directly
after
breakfast
on
some
Borrioboolan
business
,
arise
out
of
a
society
call
the
East
London
Branch
Aid
Ramification
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
have
not
see
Peepy
on
the
occasion
of
our
last
call
(
when
he
be
not
to
be
find
anywhere
,
and
when
the
cook
rather
think
he
must
have
stroll
away
with
the
dustman
's
cart
)
,
I
now
inquire
for
him
again
.
 
<EOS>
the
oyster
shell
he
have
be
build
a
house
with
be
still
in
the
passage
,
but
he
be
nowhere
discoverable
,
and
the
cook
suppose
that
he
have
"
go
after
the
sheep
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
when
we
repeat
,
with
some
surprise
,
"
the
sheep
?
"
she
say
,
oh
,
yes
,
on
market
day
he
sometimes
follow
them
quite
out
of
town
and
come
back
in
such
a
state
as
never
be
!
   
<EOS>
I
be
sit
at
the
window
with
my
guardian
on
the
follow
morning
,
and
Ada
be
busy
writing
-
of
course
to
Richard
---
when
Miss
Jellyby
be
announce
,
and
enter
,
lead
the
identical
Peepy
,
whom
she
have
make
some
endeavour
to
render
presentable
by
wipe
the
dirt
into
corner
of
his
face
and
hand
and
make
his
hair
very
wet
and
then
violently
frizzle
it
with
her
finger
.
<EOS>
everything
the
dear
child
wear
be
either
too
large
for
him
or
too
small
.
 
<EOS>
among
his
other
contradictory
decoration
he
have
the
hat
of
a
bishop
and
the
little
glove
of
a
baby
.
 
<EOS>
His
boot
be
,
on
a
small
scale
,
the
boot
of
a
ploughman
,
while
his
leg
,
so
cross
and
recrosse
with
scratch
that
they
look
like
map
,
be
bare
below
a
very
short
pair
of
plaid
drawer
finish
off
with
two
frill
of
perfectly
different
pattern
.
 
<EOS>
the
deficient
button
on
his
plaid
frock
have
evidently
be
supply
from
one
of
Mr
Jellyby
's
coat
,
they
be
so
extremely
brazen
and
so
much
too
large
.
 
<EOS>
Most
extraordinary
specimen
of
needlework
appear
on
several
part
of
his
dress
,
where
it
have
be
hastily
mend
,
and
I
recognize
the
same
hand
on
Miss
Jellyby
's
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
,
however
,
unaccountably
improve
in
her
appearance
and
look
very
pretty
.
<EOS>
She
be
conscious
of
poor
little
Peepy
be
but
a
failure
after
all
her
trouble
,
and
she
show
it
as
she
come
in
by
the
way
in
which
she
glance
first
at
him
and
then
at
us
.
   
<EOS>
"

"
say
my
guardian

<EOS>
"
Due

<EOS>
Ada
and
<EOS>
I
give

Ma

and
she
hope
you
will
excuse
her

because
she

of
the

<EOS>
She
be
go
to
put
out
five
thousand
new
circular
,
and
she
know
you
will
be
interested
to
hear
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
bring
one
of
them
with
me

<EOS>
Ma
's
compliment

"
 
<EOS>
with
which
she
present
it
sulkily
enough
.
   
<EOS>
"
thank
you

say
my
guardian

<EOS>
"
I
be
much
oblige

<EOS>
oh

dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
very
trying
wind

"
   
<EOS>
We
be
busy
with
Peepy
,
take
off
his
clerical
hat
,
ask
him
if
he
remember
us
,
and
so
on
.
 
<EOS>
Peepy
retire
behind
his
elbow
at
first
,
but
relent
at
the
sight
of
sponge
-
cake
and
allow
me
to
take
him
on
my
lap
,
where
he
sit
munch
quietly
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jarndyce
then
withdraw
into
the
temporary
growlery
,
Miss
Jellyby
open
a
conversation
with
her
usual
abruptness
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
be
go
on
just
as
bad
as
ever
in
Thavies
Inn

"
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
peace
of
my
life

talk
of
Africa

<EOS>
I
could
not

off
if
I

a
what's

man

a

"
   
<EOS>
I
try
to
say
something
soothing

be
of
no

exclaim
Miss

I

Miss
Jellyby
with
tear
in
her
eye

<EOS>
"
I
will
never
take
pain
to
dress
you
any
more

<EOS>
"

Peepy

who
be
really
a
good

who
be
so
move
by
his

vexation

go
at

<EOS>
"
It
seem
a
little
thing

poor
Miss

apologetically
,

but
I
be
quite
wear
out

<EOS>
I
be
direct
the
new
circular

two
this
morning

I
detest
the

<EOS>
Peepy
,
happily
unconscious
of
the
defect
in
his
appearance
,
sit
on
the
carpet
behind
one
of
the
leg
of
the
piano

look
calmly
out

I

observe
Miss

draw
her

nearer

those

I
be
go

She

"
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
good
deal
of
affection
in
poor
Caddy

<EOS>
She

while

this
and
cry
so
much
over
the
unwonted
little

she
have

in

cave
under

turn
himself
over
on
his

with
loud
lamentation

<EOS>
It
be
not
until
I
have
bring
him
to
kiss
his
sister
,
and
have
restore
him
to
his
place
on
my
lap
,
and
have
show
him
that
Caddy
be
laugh
(
she
laugh
expressly

could
recall

in

<EOS>
at
last
,
as
his

we

It

I

<EOS>
His
little
dancing

be
particularly
diminutive

and
he
have
a
little
innocent
,
feminine
manner
which
not
only
appeal
to
me
in
an
amiable
way
,
but
make
this
singular
effect
upon
me
,
that
I
receive
the
impression
that
he
be
like
his
mother
and
that
his
mother
have
not
be
much
consider
or
well
use
.
   
<EOS>
"
I

He

some
particular
of

He
have
marry
a
meek
little

with

tolerable
connexion

have
never

before
do
anything

deport

at

to

he
have
find
it
necessary

frequent
all
public
place
of
fashionable

lounge
resort
,
to
be
see
at
Brighton

elsewhere
at
fashionable
time

to
lead
an
idle
life
in
the
very
good
clothe

<EOS>
to
enable
him
to
do
this
,
the
affectionate
little

for
the

confide
him
to
their

one

I

out

It

her
with

what
I
may
have

without

I
can
not

<EOS>
there
be
a

My

wander

himself
so
beautifully

when
the

come
amble
up

enter
into
conversation

<EOS>
He
ask
me
,
first
of
all
,
whether
I
confer
a
charm
and
a
distinction
on
London
by
reside
in
it

<EOS>
I
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
reply
that
I
be
perfectly
aware
I
should
not
do
that
,
in
any
case
,
but
merely
tell
him
where
I
do
reside
.
   
<EOS>
"

graceful

he

with
the

Mr

in

be
so
pleased

so
dutiful
to
him

so
proud
of
him

I
almost
feel
as
if
it
be
an
unkindness

the
young

childish
character

I
feel
a
liking
for
him

a
compassion
for
him

he
put
his
little
kit
in
his
pocket

and
with
it
his
desire
to
stay
a
little
while
with
Caddy
---
and
go
away
good
-
humouredly
to
his
cold
mutton
and
his
school
at
Kensington

that
make
me
scarcely
less
irate
with
his
father
than
the
censorious
old
lady
.
   
<EOS>
the
father
open
the
room
door
for
us
and
bow
us
out
in
a
manner
,
I
must
acknowledge
,
worthy
of
his
shine
original
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
same
style
he
presently
pass
us
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
,
on
his
way
to
the
aristocratic
part
of
the
town
,
where
he
be
go
to
show
himself
among
the
few
other
gentleman
leave
.
 
<EOS>
for
some
moment
,
I
be
so
lose
in
reconsider
what
I
have
hear
and
see
in
Newman
Street
that
I
be
quite
unable
to
talk
to
Caddy
or
even
to
fix
my
attention
on
what
she
say
to
me
,
especially
when
I
begin
to
inquire
in
my
mind
whether
there
be
,
or
ever
have
be
,
any
other
gentleman
,
not
in
the
dancing
profession
,
who
live
and
found
a
reputation
entirely
on
their
deportment
.
 
<EOS>
this
become
so
bewildering
and
suggest
the
possibility
of
so
many
Mr
Turveydrops
that
I
say
,
"
esther
,
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
abandon
this
subject
altogether
and
attend
to
Caddy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
accordingly
do
so
,
and
we
chat
all
the
rest
of
the
way
to
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
   
<EOS>
Caddy
tell
me
that
her
lover
's
education
have
be
so
neglect
that
it
be
not
always
easy
to
read
his
note
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
if
he
be
not
so
anxious
about
his
spelling
and
take
less
pain
to
make
it
clear
,
he
would
do
better
;
but
he
put
so
many
unnecessary
letter
into
short
word
that
they
sometimes
quite
lose
their
english
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
do
it
with
the
good
intention
,
"
observe
Caddy
,
"
but
<EOS>
it
have
not
the
effect
he
mean
,
poor
fellow
!
"
 
<EOS>
Caddy
then
go
on
to
reason
,
how
could
he
be
expect
to
be
a
scholar
when
he
have
pass
his
whole
life
in
the
dancing
-
school
and
have
do
nothing
but
teach
and
fag
,
fag
and
teach
,
morning
,
noon
,
and
night
!
 
<EOS>
and
what
do
it
matter
?
 
<EOS>
She
could
write
letter
enough
for
both
,
as
she
know
to
her
cost
,
and
it
be
far
well
for
him
to
be
amiable
than
learn
.
 
<EOS>
"
besides
,
it
be
not
as
if
I
be
an
accomplished
girl
who
have
any
right
to
give
herself
air
,
"
say
Caddy
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
little
enough
,
I
be
sure
,
thank
to
Ma
!
   
<EOS>
"
there
be
another
thing
I
want
to
tell
you
,
now
we
be
alone
,
"
continue
Caddy
,
"
which
I
should
not
have
like
to
mention
unless
you
have
see
Prince
,
Miss
Summerson
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
what
a
house
ours
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
of
no
use
<EOS>
my
try
to
learn
anything
that
it
would
be
useful
for
Prince
's
wife
to
know
in
our
house
.
 
<EOS>
We
live
in
such
a
state
of
muddle
that
it
be
impossible
,
and
I
have
only
be
more
disheartened
whenever
I
have
try
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
get
a
little
practice
with
---
who
do
you
think
?
 
<EOS>
Poor
Miss
Flite
!
 
<EOS>
early
in
the
morning
I
help
her
to
tidy
her
room
and
clean
her
bird
,
and
I
make
her
cup
of
coffee
for
her
(
of
course
she
teach
me
)
,
and
I
have
learn
to
make
it
so
well
that
Prince
say
it
be
the
very
good
coffee
he
ever
taste
,
and
would
quite
delight
old
Mr
Turveydrop
,
who
be
very
particular
indeed
about
his
coffee
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
make
little
pudding
too
;
and
I
know
how
to
buy
neck
of
mutton
,
and
tea
,
and
sugar
,
and
butter
,
and
a
good
many
housekeeping
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
clever
at
my
needle
,
yet
,
"
say
Caddy
,
glance
at
the
repair
on
Peepy
's
frock
,
"
<EOS>
but
perhaps
I
shall
improve
,
and
since
I
have
be
engage
to
Prince
and
have
be
do
all
this
,
I
have
feel
better
-
temper
,
I
hope
,
and
more
forgiving
to
Ma
.
 
<EOS>
It
rather
put
me
out
at
first
this
morning
to
see
you
and
Miss
Clare
look
so
neat
and
pretty
and
to
feel
ashamed
of
Peepy
and
myself
too
,
but
on
the
whole
I
hope
I
be
better
-
temper
than
I
be
and
more
forgiving
to
Ma
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
poor
girl
,
try
so
hard

say
it
from
her
heart
,

touch
mine

I

I
say
everything
I
could
in

I
would
not

day

there
have
be

sudden
death
there

<EOS>
the

It

Miss
Flite

secretly
direct
my
attention

desolate
place

sorrowful
place

We

It

It

He

his

all
the
strange

it

during

he
keep
close

sometimes
detain
him
under

pretence

pass
on

<EOS>
I
can
not
imagine
a
countenance

manner
more
singularly
expressive
of
caution

indecision

and
a
perpetual
impulse
to
do
something
he

to
venture
on

than
Mr

be
that
day

His
watchfulness
of

be
incessant

He
rarely
remove
his
eye
from
his

if

he

draw
his

across

across
his

mouth
with
a
curious
expression

a
sense
of
power

turn
up
his
eye
,
and
lower
his
grey
eyebrow
until
they
appear
to

seem
to
scan
every

<EOS>
at

all

the

turn
up
his
spectacle
on
his
forehead

rub
his
hand

"
I
do
not

I
would
rather
trust
my
own
self

another

"
   
<EOS>
these
answer
and
his
manner
be
strange
enough
to
cause
my
guardian
to
inquire
of
Mr
Woodcourt
,
as
we
all
walk
across
Lincoln
's
Inn
together
,
whether
Mr
Krook
be
really
,
as
his
lodger
represent
him
,
derange
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
surgeon
reply
,
no
,
he
have
see
no
reason
to
think
so
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
exceedingly
distrustful
,
as
ignorance
usually
be
,
and
he
be
always
more
or
less
under
the
influence
of
raw
gin
,
of
which
he
drink
great
quantity
and
of
which
he
and
his
back
-
shop
,
as
we
may
have
observe
,
smell
strongly
;
but
he
do
not
think
him
mad
as
yet
.
   
<EOS>
on
our
way
home
,
I
so
conciliate
Peepy
's
affection
by
buy
him
a
windmill
and
two
flour
-
sack
that
he
would
suffer
nobody
else
to
take
off
his
hat
and
glove
and
would
sit
nowhere
at
dinner
but
at
my
side
.
 
<EOS>
Caddy
sit
upon
the
other
side
of
me
,
next
to
Ada
,
to
whom
we
impart
the
whole
history
of
the
engagement
as
soon
as
we
get
back
.
 
<EOS>
We
make
much
of
Caddy
,
and
Peepy
too
;
and
Caddy
brighten
exceedingly
;
and
my
guardian
be
as
merry
as
we
be
;
and
we
be
all
very
happy
indeed
until
Caddy
go
home
at
night
in
a
hackney
-
coach
,
with
Peepy
fast
asleep
,
but
hold
tight
to
the
windmill
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
forget
to
mention
<EOS>
---
at
least
I
have
not
mention
---
that
Mr
Woodcourt
be
the
same
dark
young
surgeon
whom
we
have
meet
at
Mr
Badger
's
.
 
<EOS>
or
that
Mr

invite
him
to
dinner
that
day

that
he
come

or
that
when
they
be
all
go

I
say
to
Ada
,
"
now

let
us
have
a
little
talk
about
Richard

Ada
laugh

say

I
do
not

<EOS>
Bell
Yard
 
<EOS>
while
we
be
in
London
<EOS>
Mr
Jarndyce
be
constantly
beset
by
the
crowd
of
excitable
lady
and
gentleman
whose
proceeding
have
so
much
astonish
us
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Quale
,
who
present
himself
soon
after
our
arrival
,
be
in
all
such
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
to
project
those
two
shine
knob
of
temple
of
his
into
everything
that
go
on
and
to
brush
his
hair
farther
and
farther
back
,
until
the
very
root
be
almost
ready
to
fly
out
of
his
head
in
inappeasable
philanthropy
.
 
<EOS>
all
object
be
alike
to
him
,
but
he
be
always
particularly
ready
for
anything
in
the
way
of
a
testimonial
to
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
His
great
power
seem
to
be
his
power
of
indiscriminate
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
sit
for
any
length
of
time
,
with
the
utmost
enjoyment
,
bathe
his
temple
in
the
light
of
any
order
of
luminary
.
 
<EOS>
have
first
see
him
perfectly
swallow
up
in
admiration
of
Mrs
Jellyby
,
I
have
suppose
her
to
be
the
absorb
object
of
his
devotion
.
 
<EOS>
I
soon
discover
my
mistake
and
find
him
to
be
train
-
bearer
and
organ
-
blower
to
a
whole
procession
of
people
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Pardiggle
come
one
day
for
a
subscription
to
something
,
and
with
her
,
Mr
Quale
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
Mrs
Pardiggle
say
,
Mr
Quale
repeat
to
us
;
and
just
as
he
have
draw
Mrs
Jellyby
out
,
he
draw
Mrs
Pardiggle
out
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Pardiggle
write
a
letter
of
introduction
to
my
guardian
in
behalf
of
her
eloquent
friend
Mr
Gusher
.
 
<EOS>
with
Mr
Gusher
appear
Mr
Quale
again
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gusher
,
be
a
flabby
gentleman
with
a
moist
surface
and
eye
so
much
too
small
for
his
moon
of
a
face
that
they
seem
to
have
be
originally
make
for
somebody
else
,
be
not
at
first
sight
prepossessing
;
yet
he
be
scarcely
seat
before
Mr
Quale
ask
Ada
and
me
,
not
inaudibly
,
whether
he
be
not
a
great
creature
---
which
he
certainly
be
,
flabbily
speak
,
though
Mr
Quale
mean
in
intellectual
beauty
---
 
and
whether
we
be
not
strike
by
his
massive
configuration
of
brow
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
we
hear
of
a
great
many
mission
of
various
sort
among
this
set
of
people
,
but
nothing
respect
them
be
half
so
clear
to
us
as
that
it
be
Mr
Quale
's
mission
to
be
in
ecstasy
with
everybody
else
's
mission
and
that
it
be
the
most
popular
mission
of
all
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jarndyce
have
fall
into
this
company
in
the
tenderness
of
his
heart
and
his
earnest
desire
to
do
all
the
good
in
his
power
;
but
that
he
feel
it
to
be
too
often
an
unsatisfactory
company
,
where
benevolence
take
spasmodic
form
,
where
charity
be
assume
as
a
regular
uniform
by
loud
professor
and
speculator
in
cheap
notoriety
,
vehement
in
profession
,
restless
and
vain
in
action
,
servile
in
the
last
degree
of
meanness
to
the
great
,
adulatory
of
one
another
,
and
intolerable
to
those
who
be
anxious
quietly
to
help
the
weak
from
fail
rather
than
with
a
great
deal
of
bluster
and
self
-
laudation
to
raise
them
up
a
little
way
when
they
be
down
,
he
plainly
tell
us
.
 
<EOS>
when
a
testimonial
be
originate
to
Mr
Quale
by
Mr
Gusher
(
who
have
already
get
one
,
originate
by
Mr
Quale
)
,
and
when
Mr
Gusher
speak
for
an
hour
and
a
half
on
the
subject
to
a
meeting
,
include
two
charity
school
of
small
boy
and
girl
,
who
be
specially
remind
of
the
widow
's
mite
,
and
request
to
come
forward
with
halfpence
and
be
acceptable
sacrifice
,
I
think
the
wind
be
in
the
east
for
three
whole
week
.
   
<EOS>
I
mention
this
because
I
be
come
to
Mr
Skimpole
again
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
that
his
off
-
hand
profession
of
childishness
and
carelessness
be
a
great
relief
to
my
guardian
,
by
contrast
with
such
thing
,
and
be
the
more
readily
believe
in
since
to
find
one
perfectly
undesigning
and
candid
man
among
many
opposite
could
not
fail
to
give
him
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
sorry
to
imply
that
Mr
Skimpole
divine
this
and
be
politic
;
I
really
never
understand
him
well
enough
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
what
he
be
to
my
guardian
,
he
certainly
be
to
the
rest
of
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
very
well
;
and
thus
,
though
he
live
in
London
,
we
have
see
nothing
of
him
until
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
appear
one
morning
in
his
usual
agreeable
way
and
as
full
of
pleasant
spirit
as
ever
.
   
<EOS>
well
,
he
say
,
here
he
be
!
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
bilious
,
but
rich
man
be
often
bilious
,
and
therefore
he
have
be
persuade
himself
that
he
be
a
man
of
property
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
be
,
in
a
certain
point
of
view
---
in
his
expansive
intention
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
enrich
his
medical
attendant
in
the
most
lavish
manner
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
always
double
,
and
sometimes
quadruple
,
his
fee
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
say
to
the
doctor
,
"
now
,
my
dear
doctor
,
it
be
quite
a
delusion
on
your
part
to
suppose
that
you
attend
me
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
overwhelm
you
with
money
---
in
my
expansive
intention
<EOS>
---
if
you
only
know
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
really
(
he
say
)
<EOS>
he
mean
it
to
that
degree
that
he
think
it
much
the
same
as
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
have
those
bit
of
metal
or
thin
paper
to
which
mankind
attach
so
much
importance
to
put
in
the
doctor
's
hand
,
he
would
have
put
them
in
the
doctor
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
not
have
them
,
he
substitute
the
will
for
the
deed
.
 
<EOS>
very
well
!
 
<EOS>
if
he
really
mean
it
---
if
his
will
be
genuine
and
real
,
which
it
be
---
it
appear
to
him
that
it
be
the
same
as
coin
,
and
cancel
the
obligation
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
,
partly
,
because
I
know
nothing
of
the
value
of
money
,
"
say
Mr
Skimpole
,
"
but
I
often
feel
this
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
so
reasonable
!
<EOS>
My
butcher
say
to
me
he
want
that
little
bill
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
part
of
the
pleasant
unconscious
poetry
of
the
man
's
nature
that
he
always
call
it
a
"
little
"
bill
---
to
make
the
payment
appear
easy
to
both
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
reply
to
the
butcher
,
"
My
good
friend
,
if
you
know
it
,
you
be
pay
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
not
have
the
trouble
of
come
to
ask
for
the
little
bill
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
pay
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
but
,
suppose
,
"
say
my
guardian
,
laugh
,
"
he
have
mean
the
meat
in
the
bill
,
instead
of
provide
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Jarndyce
,
"
he
return
,
"
you
surprise
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
take
the
butcher
's
position
.
 
<EOS>
a
butcher
I
once
deal
with
occupy
that
very
ground
.
 
<EOS>
say
he
,
"
Sir
,
why
do
you
eat
spring
lamb
at
eighteen
penny
a
pound
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
do
I
eat
spring
lamb
at
eighteen
-
pence
a
pound
,
my
honest
friend
?
"
<EOS>
say
I
,
naturally
amazed
by
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
I
like
spring
lamb
!
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
so
far
convincing
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
wish
I
have
mean
the
lamb
as
you
mean
the
money

"
 
<EOS>
"
My
good
fellow
,
"
say
I
,
"
pray
let
us
reason
like
intellectual
being

<EOS>
how
could
that
be
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
get
the
lamb
,
and
I
have
not
get
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
You
could
not
really
mean
the
lamb
without
send
it
in
,
whereas
I
can
,
and
do
,
really
mean
the
money
without
pay
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
end
of
the
subject
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
he
take
no
legal
proceeding
?
<EOS>
"
inquire
my
guardian
.
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
he
take
legal
proceeding
,
"
say
Mr
Skimpole
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
in
that
he
be
influence
by
passion
,
not
by
reason

<EOS>
passion
remind
me
of
Boythorn

<EOS>
He
write
me
that
you

him
a
short
visit
at

He

Mr

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
nature
forget
to
shade
him
off

,
I
think
,
"
observe
Mr

to
Ada
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
little
too
boisterous
---
like
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
a
little
too
vehement
---
like
a
bull
who
have
make
up
his
mind
to
consider
every
colour
scarlet
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
grant
a
sledge
-
hammer
sort
of
merit
in
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
should
have
be
surprise
if
those
two
could
have
think
very
highly
of
one
another
,
Mr
Boythorn
attach
so
much
importance
to
many
thing
and
Mr
Skimpole
care
so
little
for
anything
.
<EOS>
besides
which
,
I
have
notice
Mr
Boythorn
more
than
once
on
the
point
of
break
out
into
some
strong
opinion
when
Mr
Skimpole
be
refer
to
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
I
merely
join
Ada
in
say
that
we
have
be
greatly
pleased
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
have
invite
me

say
Mr

;
"

I
shall
go

<EOS>
He
propose
to
frank
me
down

back
again

<EOS>
I
suppose
it
will
cost
money
?
 
<EOS>
shilling
perhaps
?

<EOS>
He
ask
me
as
the
subject
arise
in
his
mind
,
in
his
graceful
,
light

hearted
manner

without
the

It
quite
shock
me
to
hear
it
,
for
I
have
already
recall
with
anything

a
serious
association

We

a
deeply

and
prominent
eye

<EOS>
He
have
a
combative
look

a
chafe

irritable
manner
which

associate
with
his

He

glimpse
I
catch

when

and
either
in

the
great
pleasure
of
his
life

in
gratitude

love
for
Charley

who
be
all
in
all
to
him
,
he
lay
his
face
among
the
scanty
fold
of
her
frock
and
pass
from
laugh
into
crying
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
time
since
our
entry
that
a
tear
have
be
shed
among
these
child
.
 
<EOS>
the
little
orphan
girl
have
speak
of
their
father
and
their
mother
as
if
all
that
sorrow
be
subdue
by
the
necessity
of
take
courage
,
and
by
her
childish
importance
in
be
able
to
work
,
and
by
her
bustling
busy
way
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
,
when
Tom
cry
,
although
she
sit
quite
tranquil
,
look
quietly
at
us
,
and
do
not
by
any
movement
disturb
a
hair
of
the
head
of
either
of
her
little
charge
,
I
see
two
silent
tear
fall
down
her
face
.
   
<EOS>
I
stand
at
the
window
with
Ada
,
pretend
to
look
at
the
housetops
,
and
the
blacken
stack
of
chimney
,
and
the
poor
plant
,
and
the
bird
in
little
cage
belong
to
the
neighbour
,
when
I
find
that
Mrs
Blinder
,
from
the
shop
below
,
have
come
in
(
perhaps
it
have
take
her
all
this
time
to
get
upstairs
)
and
be
talk
to
my
guardian
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
much
to
forgive
'em
the
rent
,
sir
,
"
she
say
;
"
who
could
take
it
from
them
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
!
"
say
my
guardian
to
us
two
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
enough
that
the
time
will
come
when
this
good
woman
will
find
that
it
be
much
,
and
that
forasmuch
as
she
do
it
unto
the
least
of
these
---
this
child
,
"
he
add
after
a
few
moment
,
"
could
she
possibly
continue
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
really
,
sir
,
I
think
she
may
,
"
say
Mrs
Blinder
,
get
her
heavy
breath
by
painful
degree
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
as
handy
as
it
be
possible
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
bless
you
,
sir

<EOS>
the
way
she
tend
them
two
child
after
the
mother
die
be
the
talk
of
the
yard
!
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
a
wonder
to
see
her
with
him
after
he
be
take
ill
,
it
really
be
!
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Blinder
,
"
he
say
to
me
the
very
last
<EOS>
he
speak
---
he
be
lie
there
 
---
"
Mrs
Blinder
,
whatever
my
calling
may
have
be
,
I
see
a
angel
sit
in
this
room
last
night
along
with
my
child
,
and
I
trust
her
to
Our
Father
!
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
He
have
no
other
calling
?
"
say
my
guardian
.
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
,
"
return
Mrs
Blinder
,
"
he
be
nothing
but
a
follerer
.
<EOS>
when
he
first
come
to
lodge
here
,
I
do
not
know
what
he
be
,
and
I
confess
that
when
I
find
out
I
give
him
notice
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
like
in
the
yard
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
approve
by
the
other
lodger
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
genteel
calling
,
"
say
Mrs
Blinder
,
"
and
most
people
do
object
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gridley
object
to
it
very
strong
,
and
he
be
a
good
lodger
,
though
his
temper
have
be
hard
try
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
so
you
give
him
notice
?
"
say
my
guardian
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
I
give
him
notice
,
"
say
Mrs
Blinder
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
really
when
the
time
come
,
and
I
know
no
other
ill
of
him
,
I
be
in
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
punctual
and
diligent
;
he
do
what
he
have
to
do
,
sir
,
"
say
Mrs
Blinder
,
unconsciously
fix
Mr
Skimpole
with
her
eye
,
"
and
it
be
something
in
this
world
even
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
so
you
keep
him
after
all
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
say
that
if
he
could
arrange
with
Mr
Gridley
,
I
could
arrange
it
with
the
other
lodger
and
should
not
so
much
mind
its
be
like
or
dislike
in
the
yard
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gridley
give
his
consent
gruff
---
but
give
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
always
gruff
with
him
,
but
he
have
be
kind
to
the
child
since
.
 
<EOS>
a
person
be
never
know
till
a
person
be
prove
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
have
many
people
be
kind
to
the
child
?
"
ask
Mr
Jarndyce
.
   
<EOS>
"
upon
the
whole
,
not
so
bad
,
sir
,
"
say
Mrs
Blinder
;
"
but
certainly
not
so
many
as
would
have
be
if
their
father
's
calling
have
be
different
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Coavins
give
a
guinea
,
and
the
follerer
make
up
a
little
purse
.
 
<EOS>
some
neighbour
in
the
yard
that
have
always
joke
and
tap
their
shoulder
when
he
go
by
come
forward
with
a
little
subscription
,
and
---
in
general
---
not
so
bad
.
<EOS>
similarly
with
Charlotte
.
 
<EOS>
some
people
will
not
employ
her
because
she
be
a
follerer
's
child
;
some
people
that
do
employ
her
cast
it
at
her
;
some
make
a
merit
of
have
her
to
work
for
them
,
with
that
and
all
her
draw
-
back
upon
her
,
and
perhaps
pay
her
less
and
put
upon
her
more
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
patienter
than
other
would
be
,
and
be
clever
too
,
and
always
willing
,
up
to
the
full
mark
of
her
strength
and
over
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
should
say
,
in
general
,
not
so
bad
,
sir
,
but
may
be
well
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Blinder
sit
down
to
give
herself
a
more
favourable
opportunity
of
recover
her
breath
,
exhaust
anew
by
so
much
talk
before
it
be
fully
restore

Mr
Jarndyce

the

the
manner

which
his

the
violent

I

he

"
   
<EOS>
His
passion
be
fearful

<EOS>
I
could
not
have
believe
in
such
rage
without
see
it

I

I
be
the
man
from
Shropshire

I
sometimes
go
beyond

though
they
have
find
it
amusing

too

me
commit

It

<EOS>
I
tell
them
that
if
I
do

I
should

I
be
a

I
believe

<EOS>
People
in
my
part
of
the
country
say
they
remember
me
so
,
but
now
I
must
have
this
vent
under
my
sense
of
injury
or
nothing
could
hold
my
wit
together

<EOS>
It
would
be
far
well

Chancellor

last

it
would
have
be
far
well
for
me
never
to
have
hear
the
name

your
high
office

unhappily
for
me

I
can
not

His
countenance
have
,
perhaps
for
year
,
become
so
set
in
its
contentious
expression
that
it
do
not
soften
,
even
now
when
he
be
quiet

<EOS>
"
I

hour

play
about

He
take
the
young
child
on
his
arm
,
where
she
be
willing
enough
to
be
carry
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
wonder
if
we
find
a
ginger
-
bread
soldier
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
let
's
go
and
look
for
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
make
his
former
rough
salutation
,
which
be
not
deficient
in
a
certain
respect
,
to
Mr
Jarndyce
,
and
bow
slightly
to
us
,
go
downstairs
to
his
room
.
   
<EOS>
upon
that
,
Mr
Skimpole
begin
to
talk
,
for
the
first
time
since
our
arrival
,
in
his
usual
gay
strain
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
,
well
,
it
be
really
very
pleasant
to
see
how
thing
lazily
adapt
themselves
to
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
this
Mr
Gridley
,
a
man
of
a
robust
will
and
surprising
energy
---
intellectually
speak
,
a
sort
of
inharmonious
blacksmith
---
and
he
could
easily
imagine
that
there
Gridley
be
,
year
ago
,
wander
about
in
life
for
something
to
expend
his
superfluous
combativeness
upon
---
a
sort
of
Young
Love
among
the
thorn
---
when
the
Court
of
Chancery
come
in
his
way
and
accommodate
him
with
the
exact
thing
he
want
.
 
<EOS>
there
they
be
,
match
,
ever
afterwards
!
 
<EOS>
otherwise
he
may
have
be
a
great
general
,
blow
up
all
sort
of
town
,
or
he
may
have
be
a
great
politician
,
deal
in
all
sort
of
parliamentary
rhetoric
;
but
as
it
be
,
he
and
the
Court
of
Chancery
have
fall
upon
each
other
in
the
pleasantest
way
,
and
nobody
be
much
the
bad
,
and
Gridley
be
,
so
to
speak
,
from
that
hour
provide
for
.
 
<EOS>
then
look
at
Coavinses
!
<EOS>
how
delightfully
poor
Coavinses
(
father
of
these
charming
child
)
illustrate
the
same
principle
!
 
<EOS>
He
,
Mr
Skimpole
,
himself
,
have
sometimes
repine
at
the
existence
of
Coavinses
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
find
coavinse
in
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
have
dispense
with
coavinse
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
time
when
,
if
he
have
be
a
sultan
,
and
his
grand
vizier
have
say
one
morning
,
"
what
do
the
Commander
of
the
faithful
require
at
the
hand
of
his
slave
?
<EOS>
"
he
may
have
even
go
so
far
as
to
reply
,
"
the
head
of
coavinse
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
what
turn
out
to
be
the
case
?
 
<EOS>
that
,
all
that
time
,
he
have
be
give
employment
to
a
most
deserving
man
,
that
he
have
be
a
benefactor
to
Coavinses
,
that
he
have
actually
be
enable
coavinse
to
bring
up
these
charming
child
in
this
agreeable
way
,
develop
these
social
virtue
!
 
<EOS>
Insomuch
that
his
heart
have
just
now
swell
and
the
tear
have
come
into
his
eye
when
he
have
look
round
the
room
and
think
,
"
I
be
the
great
patron
of
Coavinses
,
and
his
little
comfort
be
my
work
!
"
   
<EOS>
there
be
something
so
captivate
in
his
light
way
of
touch
these
fantastic
string
,
and
he
be
such
a
mirthful
child
by
the
side
of
the
graver
childhood
we
have
see
,
that
he
make
my
guardian
smile
even
as
he
turn
towards
us
from
a
little
private
talk
with
Mrs
Blinder
.
 
<EOS>
We
kiss
Charley
,
and
take
her
downstairs
with
us
,
and
stop
outside
the
house
to
see
her
run
away
to
her
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
where
she
be
go
,
but
we
see
her
run
,
<EOS>
such
a
little
,
little
creature
in
her
womanly
bonnet
and
apron
,
through
a
covered
way
at
the
bottom
of
the
court
and
melt
into
the
city
's
strife
and
sound
like
a
dewdrop
in
an
ocean

for
anything

with
confidence
predict

<EOS>
even
Sir
Leicester
's
gallantry
have
some
trouble
to
keep
pace
with
her

It

that

the
gout

dart
into
the
old
oak
bedchamber
at
Chesney
Wold

grip
him
by
both
leg

<EOS>
Sir
Leicester
receive
the
gout
as
a
troublesome
demon

still
a
demon
of
the
patrician
order

through
a
course
of

may
have
die
of

rheumatism

may
have
take
base
contagion
from
the
tainted
blood
of
the
sick
vulgar

but
the
Dedlock
family
have
communicate
something
exclusive
even
to
the
levelling
process
of
die
by

of
their

family
gout

It

come
down

Sir

He

It

only
one

what

there

between
the

the

the
Mercury

who

what

It

these

as

these

<EOS>
twice
lately
there
have
be
a
crash
and
a
cloud

like
the

these

the

there

the

<EOS>
this
desirable

of
course

<EOS>
It
would
be
an
insult
to
the
discernment
of
any
man
with
half
an
eye
to
tell
him
so
.
 
<EOS>
whether
"
Tom

be
the
popular
representative
of
the
original
plaintiff

defendant
in

or
whether

live
here
when
the
suit
have
lay
the
street
waste
,
all
alone
,
until
other
settler
come
to
join
him

or
whether
the
traditional

be
a
comprehensive
name
for
a
retreat
cut
off
from
honest
company
and
put
out
of
the
pale
of

,
perhaps
nobody

<EOS>
certainly
Jo
do
not

say
Jo

"
I

<EOS>
It
must
be
a
strange
state
to
be
like
Jo
!
 
<EOS>
to
shuffle
through
the
street
,
unfamiliar
with
the
shape
,
and
in
utter
darkness
as
to
the
meaning
,
of
those
mysterious
symbol

so
abundant
over
the
shop
,
and
at
the
corner
of
street
,
and
on
the
door
,
and
in
the
window
!
 
<EOS>
to
see
people
read
,
and
to
see
people
write
,
and
to
see
the
postman
deliver
letter
,
and
not
to
have
the
least
idea
of
all
that
language
---
to
be
,
to
every
scrap
of
it
,
stone
blind
and
dumb
!
<EOS>
It
must
be
very
puzzling
to
see
the
good
company
go
to
the
church
on
Sundays
,
with
their
book
in
their
hand
,
and
to
think
(
for
perhaps
Jo
doe
think
at
odd
time
)
what
do
it
all
mean
,
and
if
it
mean
anything
to
anybody
,
how
come
it
that
it
mean
nothing
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
to
be
hustle
,
and
jostle
,
and
move
on
;
and
really
to
feel
that
it
would
appear
to
be
perfectly
true
that
I
have
no
business
here
,
or
there
,
or
anywhere
;
and
yet
to
be
perplex
by
the
consideration
that
I
am
here
somehow
,
too
,
and
everybody
overlook
me
until
I
become
the
creature
that
I
be
!
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
a
strange
state
,
not
merely
to
be
tell
that
I
be
scarcely
human
(
as
in
the
case
of
my
offering
myself
for
a
witness
)
,
but
to
feel
it
of
my
own
knowledge
all
my
life
!
 
<EOS>
to
see
the
horse
,
dog
,
and
cattle
go
by
me
and
to
know
that
in
ignorance
I
belong
to
them
and
not
to
the
superior
being
in
my
shape
,
whose
delicacy
I
offend
!
 
<EOS>
Jo
's
idea
of
a
criminal
trial
,
or
a
judge
,
or
a
bishop
,
or
a
govemment
,
or
that
inestimable
jewel
to
him
<EOS>
(
if
he
only
know
it
)
<EOS>
the
Constitution
,
should
be
strange
!
 
<EOS>
His
whole
material
and
immaterial
life
be
wonderfully
strange
;
his
death
,
the
strange
thing
of
all

<EOS>
Jo
come
out
of
Tom
-
all
-
Alone

,
meet
the
tardy
morning
which
be
always
late
in
get
down
there
,
and
munch
his
dirty
bit
of
bread
as
he
come
along
.
 
<EOS>
His
way
lie
through
many
street
,
and
the
house
not

he
sit
down
to
breakfast
on
the
door
-
step
of
the
Society
for
the
Propagation
of
the
Gospel
in
Foreign
Parts
and
give
it
a
brush
when
he
have
finish
as
an
acknowledgment
of
the
accommodation
.
 
<EOS>
He
admire
the
size
of
the
edifice
and
wonder
what
it
be
all
about
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
idea
,
poor
wretch
,
of
the
spiritual
destitution
of
a
coral
reef
in
the
Pacific
or
what
it
cost
to
look
up
the
precious
soul
among
the
coco

nut
and
bread

fruit
.
   
<EOS>
He
go
to
his
crossing
and
begin
to
lay
it
out
for
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
the
town
awake
<EOS>
;
the
great
tee

totum
be
set
up
for
its
daily
spin
and
whirl
;
all
that
unaccountable
reading
and
writing
,
which
have
be
suspend
for
a
few
hour
,
recommence
.
 
<EOS>
Jo
and
the
other
low
animal
get
on
in
the
unintelligible
mess
as
they
can
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
market

day

<EOS>
the
blinded
oxen
,
over

goad

over

drive

never

run
into
wrong
place
and
be
beat
out
,
and
plunge
red

eyed
and
foam
at
stone
wall
,
and
often
sorely
hurt
the
innocent
,
and
often
sorely
hurt
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
very
like
Jo
and
his
order
;
very
,
very
like
!
   
<EOS>
a
band
of
music
come
and
play
.
 
<EOS>
Jo
listen
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
so
do
a
dog
 
---
a
drover
's
dog
,
wait
for
his
master
outside
a
butcher
's
shop
,
and
evidently
think
about
those
sheep
he
have
have
upon
his
mind
for
some
hour
and
be
happily
rid
of
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
perplex
respect
three
or
four
,
can
not
remember
where
he
leave
them
,
look
up
and
down
the
street
as
half
expect
to
see
them
astray
,
suddenly
prick
up
his
ear
and
remember
all
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
a
thoroughly
vagabond
dog
,
accustom
to
low
company
and
public
-
house
;
a
terrific
dog
to
sheep
,
ready
at
a
whistle
to
scamper
over
their
back
and
tear
out
mouthful
of
their
wool
;
but
an
educate
,
improve
,
develop
dog
who
have
be
teach
his
duty
and
know
how
to
discharge
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
Jo
listen
to
the
music
,
probably
with
much
the
same
amount
of
animal
satisfaction
;
likewise
as
to
awakened
association
,
aspiration
,
or
regret
,
melancholy
or
joyful
reference
to
thing
beyond
the
sense
,
they
be
probably
upon
a
par
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
otherwise
,
how
far
above
the
human
listener
be
the
brute
!
   
<EOS>
turn
that
dog
's
descendant
wild
,
like
Jo
,
and
in
a
very
few
year
they
will
so
degenerate
that
they
will
lose
even
their
bark
---
but
not
their
bite
.
   
<EOS>
the
day
change
as
it
wear
itself
away
and
become
dark
and
drizzly

<EOS>
Jo
fight
it
out
at
his
crossing
among
the
mud
and
wheel
,
the
horse
,
whip
,
and
umbrella
,
and
get
but
a
scanty
sum
to
pay
for
the
unsavoury
shelter
of

twilight

why

look
out

be

so
he
do

and

<EOS>
there
be
woman
enough
in

<EOS>

Mr

<EOS>
too
many
;
they
be
at
the
bottom
of
all
that

wrong
in
it

though
,
for

They
be
all
secret

<EOS>
Mr
Tulkinghorn
know
that
very
well

<EOS>
but
they
be
not

the
woman
who
now
leave
him
and
his
house
behind

between
whose
plain
dress
and
her
refined
manner
there
be
something
exceedingly
inconsistent

<EOS>
She

she

Her

She
never

She

Esther

Narrative
 
Richard
very
often
come
to
see
us
while
we
remain
in
London
(
though
he
soon
fail
in
his
letter
-
writing
)
,
and
with
his
quick
ability
,
his
good
spirit
,
his
good
temper
,
his
gaiety
and
freshness
,
be
always
delightful
.
 
<EOS>
but
though
I
like
him
more
and
more
the
well
I
know
him
,
I
still
feel
more
and
more
how
much
it
be
to
be
regret
that
he
have
be
educate
in
no
habit
of
application
and
concentration
.
 
<EOS>
the
system
which
have
address
him
in
exactly
the
same
manner
as
it
have
address
hundred
of
other
boy
,
all
varying
in
character
and
capacity
,
have
enable
him
to
dash
through
his
task
,
always
with
fair
credit
and
often
with
distinction
,
but
in
a
fitful
,
dazzling
way
that
have
confirm
his
reliance
on
those
very
quality
in
himself
which
it
have
be
most
desirable
to
direct
and
train
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
good
quality
,
without
which
no
high
place
can
be
meritoriously
win
,
but
like
fire
and
water
,
though
excellent
servant
,
they
be
very
bad
master
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
have
be
under
Richard
's
direction
,
they
would
have
be
his
friend
;
but
Richard
be
under
their
direction
,
they
become
his
enemy

<EOS>
I
write
down
these
opinion
not
because
I
believe
that
this
or
any
other
thing
be
so
because
I

so

only
because
I
do
think
so
<EOS>

I
want
to
be
quite
candid
about
all
I
think
and
do
.
<EOS>
these
be
my
thought
about
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
often
observe
besides
how
right
my
guardian
be
in
what
he
have
say
,
and
that
the
uncertainty
and
delay
of
the
Chancery
suit
have
impart
to
his
nature
something
of
the
careless
spirit
of
a
gamester
who
feel
that
he
be
part
of
a
great
gaming
system
.
   
<EOS>
Mr

Mrs
Bayham
Badger
come
one
afternoon

my
guardian
be
not
at

in

I
naturally
inquire
after
Richard

<EOS>
"

Mrs

"
be

Captain

be

I
may
render
the

tribute
<EOS>

I
be
sure

to

I
---
you
will
not

me
premature
if
I
mention
it

"
   
<EOS>
I
say
no
,
as
Mrs

insinuate
tone
seem
to
require
such
an
answer

sweetly

"
when

my

the
utmost
consolation
it
could
impart

to

our

open
to
the
student
as
a

of
Scientific
Exchange

every

evening
there
be
lemonade

a
mixed
biscuit
for
all

choose

<EOS>
"
remarkable

,
Miss
Summerson

"

Mr

reverentially
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
must
have
be
great
intellectual
friction

on
there
under
the
auspex
of

<EOS>
"
and
now
,
"
pursue
Mrs
Badger
,
"
now
that
I
be
the
wife
of
my

third
,
Mr
Badger
,
I
still
pursue
those
habit
of
observation
which
be
form
during
the
lifetime
of
Captain
Swosser
and
adapt
to
new
and
unexpected
purpose
during
the
lifetime
of
Professor
Dingo
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
have
not
come
to
the
consideration
of
Mr
Carstone
as
a
neophyte
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
be
very
much
of
the
opinion
,
my
dear
,
that
he
have
not
choose
his
profession
advisedly
.
"
   
<EOS>
Ada
look
so
very
anxious
now
that
I
ask
Mrs
Badger
on
what
she
found
her
supposition
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Miss
Summerson
,
"
she
reply
,
"
on
Mr
Carstone
's
character
and
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
of
such
a
very
easy
disposition
that
probably
he
would
never
think
it
worthwhile
to
mention
how
he
really
feel
,
but
he
feel
languid
about
the
profession
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
that
positive
interest
in
it
which
make
it
his
vocation
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
any
decide
impression
in
reference
to
it
,
I
should
say
it
be
that
it
be
a
tiresome
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
this
be
not
promising
.
 
<EOS>
young
man
like
Mr
Allan
Woodcourt
who
take
it
from
a
strong
interest
in
all
that
it
can
do
will
find
some
reward
in
it
through
a
great
deal
of
work
for
a
very
little
money
and
through
year
of
considerable
endurance
and
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
quite
convinced
that
this
would
never
be
the
case
with
Mr
Carstone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
Mr
Badger
think
so
too
?
"
ask
Ada
timidly
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
Mr
Badger
,
"
to
tell
the
truth
,
Miss
Clare
,
this
view
of
the
matter
have
not
occur
to
me
until
Mrs
Badger
mention
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
Mrs
Badger
put
it
in
that
light
,
I
naturally
give
great
consideration
to
it
,
know
that
Mrs
Badger
's
mind
,
in
addition
to
its
natural
advantage
,
have
have
the
rare
advantage
of
be
form
by
two
<EOS>
such
very
distinguished
(
I
will
even
say
illustrious
)
public
man
as
Captain
Swosser
of
the
Royal
Navy
and
Professor
Dingo
.
 
<EOS>
the
conclusion
at
which
I
have
arrive
be
---
in
short
,
be
Mrs
Badger
's
conclusion
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
maxim
of
Captain
Swosser
's
,
"
say
Mrs
Badger
,
"
speak
in
his
figurative
naval
manner
,
that
when
you
make
pitch
hot
,
you
can
not
make
it
too
hot
;
and
that
if
you
only
have
to
swab
a
plank
,
you
should
swab
it
as
if
Davy
Jones
be
after
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
appear
to
me
that
this
maxim
be
applicable
to
the
medical
as
well
as
to
the
nautical
profession
.
   
<EOS>
"
to
all
profession
,
"
observe
Mr
Badger
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
admirably
say
by
Captain
Swosser
.
 
<EOS>
Beautifully
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
People
object
to
Professor
Dingo
when
we
be
stay
in
the
north
of
Devon
after
our
marriage
,
"
say
Mrs
Badger
,
"
that
he
disfigure
some
of
the
house
and
other
building
by
chip
off
fragment
of
those
edifice
with
his
little
geological
hammer
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
professor
reply
that
he
know
of
no
building
save
the
Temple
of
Science
.
 
<EOS>
the
principle
be
the
same
,
I
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
precisely
the
same
,
"
say
Mr
Badger
.
 
<EOS>
"
finely
express
!
 
<EOS>
the
professor
make
the
same
remark
,
Miss
Summerson
,
in
his
last
illness
,
when
(
his
mind
wander
)
<EOS>
he
insist
on

his
little
hammer
under
the
pillow
and
chip
at
the
countenance
of
the
attendant
.
 
<EOS>
the
rule
passion
!
"
   
<EOS>
although
we
could
have
dispense
with
the
length
at
which
Mr
and
Mrs
Badger
pursue
the
conversation
,
we
both
feel
that
it
be
disintereste
in
them
to
express
the
opinion
they
have
communicate
to
us
and
that
there
be
a
great
probability
of
its
be
sound
.
<EOS>
We
agree
to
say
nothing
to
Mr
Jarndyce
until
we
have
speak
to
Richard
;
and
as
he
be
come
next
evening
,
we
resolve
to
have
a
very
serious
talk
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
so
after
he
have
be
a
little
while
with
Ada
,
I
go
in
and
find
my
darling
(
as
I
know
she
would
be
)
prepare
to
consider
him
thoroughly
right
in
whatever
he
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
how
do
you
get
on
,
Richard
?
"
say
I.
 
I
always
sit
down
on
the
other
side
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
quite
a
sister
of
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
well
enough
!
"
say
Richard
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
can
not
say
well
than
that
,
Esther
,
can
he
?
"
cry
my
pet
triumphantly
.
   
<EOS>
I
try
to
look
at
my
pet
in
the
wise
manner
,
but
of
course
I
could
not
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
enough
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
.
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Richard
,
"
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
rather
jog
-
trotty
and
humdrum
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
will
do
as
well
as
anything
else
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
My

Richard
!
<EOS>
"
I
remonstrate
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter

Dame
Durden

Ada

so
confidingly
at
me
across
him
;
"
because
if
it
will
do
as
well

it
will
do
very
well

"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes

I
hope
so
,

return
Richard
,
carelessly
toss
his
hair
from
his
forehead
.
 
<EOS>
"
after
all
,
it
may
be
only
a
kind
of
probation
till
our
suit
be
---
I
forget
though
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
to
mention
the
suit

<EOS>
forbid
ground
!
 
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
,
it
be
all
right
enough
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
talk
about
something
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
Ada
would
have
do
so
willingly
,
and
with
a
full
persuasion
that
we
have
bring
the
question
to
a
most
satisfactory
state
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
think
it
would
be
useless
to
stop
there
,
so
I
begin
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
but
Richard
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
my
dear
Ada
!
 
<EOS>
consider
how
important
it
be
to
you
both
,
and
what
a
point
of
honour
it
be
towards
your
cousin
,
that
you
,
Richard
,
should
be
quite
in
earnest
without
any
reservation
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
we
have
well
talk
about
this
,
really
,
Ada
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
too
late
very
soon
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
!
 
<EOS>
We
must
talk
about
it
!
"
<EOS>
say
Ada
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
think
Richard
be
right
.
"
   
<EOS>
what
be
the
use
of
my
try
to
look
wise
when
she
be
so
pretty
,
and
so
engaging
,
and
so
fond
of
him
!
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
and
Mrs
Badger
be
here
yesterday
,
Richard
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
they
seem
disposed
to
think
that
you
have
no
great
liking
for
the
profession
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
they
though
?
"
say
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
well
,
that
rather
alter
the
case
,
because
I
have
no
idea
that
they
think
so
,
and
I
should
not
have
like
to
disappoint
or
inconvenience
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
I
do
not
care
much
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
oh
,
it
do
not
matter
!
 
<EOS>
It
will
do
as
well
as
anything
else

"
   
<EOS>
"
You
hear
him
,
Ada
!
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
the
fact
be
,
"
Richard
proceed
,
half
thoughtfully
and
half
jocosely
,
"
it
be
not
quite
in
my
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
take
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
get
too
much
of
Mrs
Bayham
Badger
's
first
and
second
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
that
be
very
natural
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Ada
,
quite
delighted
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
very
thing
we
both
say
yesterday
,
Esther
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
then
,
"
pursue
Richard
,
"
it
be
monotonous
,
and
to
-
day
be
too
like
yesterday
,
and
to
-
morrow
be
too
like
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
but
I
be
afraid
,
"
say
I
,
"
this
be
an
objection
to
all
kind
of
application
---
to
life
itself
,
except
under
some
very
uncommon
circumstance
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
"
return
Richard
,
still
consider
.
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
!
<EOS>
ha
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
then
,
you
know
,
"
he
add
,
suddenly
become
gay
again
,
"
we
travel
outside
a
circle
to
what
I
say
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
do
as
well
as
anything
else
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
it
be
all
right
enough
!
 
<EOS>
let
us
talk
about
something
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
but
even
Ada
,
with
her
loving
face
---
and
if
it
have
seem
innocent
and
trust
when
I
first
see
it
in
that
memorable
November
fog
,
how
much
more
do
it
seem
now
when
I
know
her
innocent
and
trust
heart
<EOS>
---
even
Ada
shake
her
head
at
this
and
look
serious
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
think
it
a
good
opportunity
to
hint
to
Richard
that
if
he
be
sometimes
a
little
careless
of
himself
,
I
be
very
sure
he
never
mean
to
be
careless
of
Ada
,
and
that
it
be
a
part
of
his
affectionate
consideration
for
her
not
to
slight
the
importance
of
a
step
that
may
influence
both
their
life
.
 
<EOS>
this
make
him
almost
grave
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Mother
Hubbard
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
be
the
very
thing
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
think
of
that
several
time
and
have
be
quite
angry
with
myself
for
meaning
to
be
so
much
in
earnest
<EOS>
and
---
somehow
---
not
exactly
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
it
be
;
I
seem
to
want
something
or
other
to
stand
by
.
 
<EOS>
even
you
have
no
idea
how
fond
I
be
of
Ada
(
my
darling
cousin
<EOS>
,
I
love
you
,
so
much
!
)
,
but
I
do
not
settle
down
to
constancy
in
other
thing
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
such
uphill
work
,
and
it
take
such
a
time
!
"
<EOS>
say
Richard
with
an
air
of
vexation
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
may
be
,
"
I
suggest
,
"
because
you
do
not
like
what
you
have
choose
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
poor
fellow
!
"
say
Ada
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
do
not
wonder
at
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
of
the
least
use
my
try
to
look
wise
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
again
,
but
how
could
I
do
it
,
or
how
could
it
have
any
effect
if
I
could
,
while
Ada
rest
her
clasped
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
while
he
look
at
her
tender
blue
eye
,
and
while
they
look
at
him
!
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
my
precious
girl
,
"
say
Richard
,
pass
her
golden
curl
through
and
through
his
hand
,
"
<EOS>
I
be
a
little
hasty
perhaps
;
or
I
misunderstood
my
own
inclination
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
They
do
not
seem
to
lie
in
that
direction
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
tell
till
I
try
.
 
<EOS>
now
the
question
be
whether
it
be
worth
-
while
to
undo
all
that
have
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
like
make
a
great
disturbance
about
nothing
particular
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Richard
,
"
say
I
,
"
how
CAN
you
say
about
nothing
particular
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
absolutely
that
,
"
he
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
it
MAY
be
nothing
particular
because
I
may
never
want
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
both
Ada
and
I
urge
,
in
reply
,
not
only
that
it
be
decidedly
worth
-
while
to
undo
what
have
be
do
,
but
that
it
must
be
undo
.
<EOS>
I
then
ask
Richard
whether
he
have
think
of
any
more
congenial
pursuit
.
   
<EOS>
"
there
,
my
dear
Mrs
Shipton
,
"
say
Richard
,
"
you
touch
me
home
.
<EOS>
yes
,
I
have

<EOS>
I
have
be
think
that
the
law
be
the
boy
for
me

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
the
law
!
"
<EOS>
repeat
Ada
as
if
she
be
afraid
of
the
name
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
I
go
into
Kenge
's
office
,
"
say
Richard
,
"
and
if
I
be
place
under
article
to
Kenge
,
I
should
have
my
eye
on
the
---
hum
!

---
 
<EOS>
the
forbidden
ground

and
should
be
able
to
study

it

myself
that
it

not
neglect

be
be
properly
conduct

<EOS>
I
should
be
able
to
look
after
Ada
's
interest
and
my
own
interest
(
the
same
thing
!
)
<EOS>
;
and
I
should
peg
away
at
Blackstone
and
all
those
fellow
with
the
most
tremendous
ardour
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
not
by
any
mean
<EOS>
so
sure
of
that
,
and
I
see
how
his
hankering
after
the
vague
thing
yet
to
come
of
those
long
-
defer
hope
cast
a
shade
on
Ada
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
think
it
best
to
encourage
him
in
any
project
of
continuous
exertion
,
and
only
advise
him
to
be
quite
sure
that
his
mind
be
make
up
now

<EOS>
My

Minerva

Richard

I
be
as
steady
as
you

I
make
a
mistake
;
we
be
all
liable
to
mistake
;
I
will
not
do
so
any
more

I
will
become
such
a

Richard

relapse
into
doubt

it

worth
-
while

after
all

to
make
such
a
disturbance
about
nothing
particular

"
   
<EOS>
this
lead
to
our
saying
again
,
with
a
great
deal
of
gravity
,
all
that
we
have
say
already
and
to
our
come
to
much
the

conclusion
afterwards

<EOS>
but
we
so
strongly
advise
Richard
to
be
frank
and
open
with
Mr
Jarndyce
,
without
a
moment
's
delay
,
and
his
disposition
be
naturally
so
opposed
to
concealment
that
he
seek
him
out
at
once
(
take
us
with
him
)
and
make
a
full
avowal
.

"
Rick

him
attentively

retreat

that
we

,
in
the
matter

have
a
good
trial
before

We

about

Richard
's
energy
be
of
such
an
impatient

fitful
kind
that
he
would
have
like
nothing
well
than
to
have
go
to
Mr
Kenge
's
office
in
that
hour
and
to
have
enter
into
article
with

spot

submitting
,
however
,
with
a
good
grace
to
the
caution
that
we
have
show
to
be
so
necessary
,
he
content
himself
with
sit
down
among

in
his
light
spirit

talk
as
if
his
one
unvarye

My

be
very
kind

cordial
with

rather
grave
,
enough
so
to
cause
Ada
,
when
he
have
depart
<EOS>
and
we
be
go
upstairs
to
bed
,
<EOS>
to
say
,
"

"
no

her

upon

where
she
have
put
it
in

him
good
night

I
should
be
a
little
so

"
My

<EOS>
I
should
be
more
disposed

so
quietly

honestly
she
say
it

with
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder

both
hand
now
---
and
look
up
into
his
face
,
like
the
picture
of
truth
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
say
my
guardian
,
thoughtfully
regard
her
,
"
I
think
it
must
be
somewhere
write
that
the
virtue

mother
shall
occasionally

visit
on
the

as
well

the
sin
of

night

my

<EOS>
good
night

little

pleasant
slumber
!
 
<EOS>
happy
dream
!
"
   
<EOS>
this
be
the
first
time
I
ever
see
him
follow
Ada
with
his
eye
with
something
of
a
shadow
on
their
benevolent
expression
.
 
<EOS>
I
well
remember
the
look
with
which
he
have
contemplate
her
and
Richard
when
she
be
singe
in
the
firelight
;
it
be
but
a
very
little
while
since
he
have
watch
them
pass
down
the
room
in
which
the
sun
be
shine
,
and
away
into
the
shade
;
but
his
glance
be
change
,
and
even
the
silent
look
of
confidence
in
me
which
now
follow
it
once
more
be
not
quite
so
hopeful
and
untroubled
as
it
have
originally
be
.
   
<EOS>
Ada
praise
Richard
more
to
me
that
night
than
ever
she
have
praise
him
yet
.
 
<EOS>
She
go
to
sleep
with
a
little
bracelet
he
have
give
her
clasp
upon
her
arm
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
she
be
dream
of
him
when
I
kiss
her
cheek
after
she
have
sleep
an
hour
and
see
how
tranquil
and
happy
she
look
.
   
<EOS>
for
I
be
so
little
inclined
to
sleep
myself
that
night
that
I
sit
up
work
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
worth
mention
for
its
own
sake
,
but
I
be
wakeful
and
rather
low
-
spirited
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
why
.
 
<EOS>
at
least
I
do
not
think
I
know
why
.
 
<EOS>
at
least
,
perhaps
I
do
,
but
I
do
not
think
it
matter
.
   
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
I
make
up
my
mind
to
be
so
dreadfully
industrious
that
I
would
leave
myself
not
a
moment
's
leisure
to
be
low
-
spirited
.
<EOS>
for
I
naturally
say
,
"
esther
!
 
<EOS>
You
to
be
low
-
spirited
.
 
<EOS>
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
it
really
be
time
to
say
so
,
for
I
---
<EOS>
yes
,
I
really
do
see
myself
in
the
glass
,
almost
cry
.
 
<EOS>
"
as
if
you
have
anything
to
make
you
unhappy
,
instead
of
everything
to
make
you
happy
,
you
ungrateful
heart
!
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
if
I
could
have
make
myself
go
to
sleep
,
I
would
have
do
it
directly
,
but
not
be
able
to
do
that
,
I
take
out
of
my
basket
some
ornamental
work
for
our
house
(
I
mean
Bleak
House
)
that
I
be
busy
with
at
that
time
and
sit
down
to
it
with
great
determination
.
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
to
count
all
the
stitch
in
that
work
,
and
I
resolve
to
go
on
with
it
until
I
could
not
keep
my
eye
open
,
and
then
to
go
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
I
soon
find
myself
very
busy
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
leave
some
silk
downstairs
in
a
work
-
table
drawer
in
the
temporary
growlery
,
and
come
to
a
stop
for
want
of
it
<EOS>
,
I
take
my
candle
and
go
softly
down
to
get
it
.
 
<EOS>
to
my
great
surprise
,
on
go
in
I
find
my
guardian
still
there
,
and
sit
look
at
the
ashe
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
lose
in
thought
,
his
book
lie
unheeded
by
his
side
,
his
silvered
iron
-
grey
hair
be
scatter
confusedly
upon
his
forehead
as
though
his
hand
have
be
wander
among
it
while
his
thought
be
elsewhere
,
and
his
face
look
worn
.
 
<EOS>
almost
frightened
by
come
upon
him
so
unexpectedly
,
I
stand
still
for
a
moment
and
should
have
retire
without
speak
have
he
not
,
in
again
pass
his
hand
abstractedly
through
his
hair
,
see
me
and
start
.
   
<EOS>
"
esther
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
tell
him
what
I
have
come
for
.
   
<EOS>
"
at
work
so
late
,
my
dear
?
"
   
"
I
be
work
late
to
-
night
,
"
say
I
,
"
because
I
could
not
sleep
and
wish
to
tire
myself
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
dear
guardian
,
you
be
late
too
,
and
look
weary
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
no
trouble
,
I
hope
,
to
keep
you
wake
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
none
,
little
woman
,
that
you
would
readily
understand
,
"
say
he
.
   
<EOS>
He
speak
in
a
regretful
tone
so
new
to
me
that
I
inwardly
repeat
,
as
if
that
would
help
me
to
his
meaning
,
"
that
I
could
readily
understand
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
remain
a
moment
,
Esther
,
"
say
he
,
"
You
be
in
my
thought

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
be
not
the
trouble

guardian
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
slightly
wave
his
hand
and
fall
into
his
usual
manner
.
 
<EOS>
the
change
be
so
remarkable
,
and
he
appear
to
make
it
by
dint
of
so
much
self
-
command
,
that
I
find
myself
again
inwardly
repeat
,
"
none
that
I
could
understand

"
   
<EOS>
"
little
woman
,
"
say
my
guardian
,
"
I
be
think
---
that
is
,
I
have
be
think
since
I
have
be
sit
here
---
that
you
ought
to
know
of
your
own
history
all
I
know

very
little

to
nothing

I
reply
,
"
when
you
speak
to
me
before
on
that
subject

since
then

he
gravely
interpose
,
anticipate
what
I

I
have
reflect
that
your
have
anything
to
ask

my
have
anything
to

different
consideration

Esther

be
perhaps
my
duty
to
impart
to
you
the
little
I

if
you
think
so

right

so

he
return
very
gently
,

kindly
,
and
very
distinctly
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
I
think
so
now

if
any
real
disadvantage
can
attach
to
your
position
in
the
mind

any
man

woman
worth
a

it
be
right
that
you
at

not
magnify
it

yourself

have
vague
impression

its
nature

<EOS>
I
sit
down
and
say
after
a
little
effort
to
be
as
calm
as
I
ought
to
be
,
"
one
of
my
early
remembrance

guardian

of
these

:
"
Your
mother

Esther

be
your
disgrace

and
you
be
her

the
time
will
come
,
and
soon
enough
,
when
you
will
understand
this
well
,

will
feel
it
too
,
as
no
one
save
a
woman
can
.

"
 
I
have
cover
my
face
with
my
hand
in
repeat
the
word
,
but
I
take
them
away
now
with
a
well
kind
of
shame
,
I
hope
,
and
tell
him
that
to
him
I
owe
the
blessing
that
I
have
from
my
childhood

hour

never
,
never

put
up
his

if
to
stop
me

no

year
,

after
think
for
a
little
while
,
"
have
pass
since
I
receive
a
letter
from
a
lady
live
in
seclusion
,
write
with
a
stern
passion
and
power
that
render
it
unlike
all
other
letter
I
have
ever
read
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
write
to
me
(
as
it
tell
me
in
so
many
word
)
,
perhaps
because
it
be
the
writer
's
idiosyncrasy
to
put
that
trust
in
me
,
perhaps
because
it
be
mine
to
justify
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
tell
me
of
a
child
,
an
orphan
girl
then
twelve
year
old
,
in
some
such
cruel
word
as
those
which
live
in
your
remembrance
.
 
<EOS>
It
tell
me
that
the
writer
have
breed
her
in
secrecy
from
her
birth
,
have
blot
out
all
trace
of
her
existence
,
and
that
if
the
writer
be
to
die
before
the
child
become
a
woman
,
she
would
be
leave
entirely
friendless
,
nameless
,
and
unknown

It
ask
me
to
consider
if
I
would

in

finish
what
the

begin

Your
early
recollection
,
my
dear
,
will
supply
the
gloomy
medium
through
which
all
this
be
see
and
express
by
the
writer
,
and
the
distorted
religion
which
cloud
her
mind
with
impression
of
the
need
there
be
for
the
child
to
expiate
an
offence
of
which
she
be
quite
innocent

concerned

I
take
his

It
lay
the
injunction

I

<EOS>
that
more
than
this
<EOS>
she
would
never
<EOS>
(
and
he
be
well
persuade
of
the
steadfastness
of
her
resolution
)
for
any
human
consideration
disclose
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
,
I
have
tell
you
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
hold
his
hand
for
a
little
while
in
mine
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
my
ward
oftener
than
she
see
me
,
"
he
add
,
cheerily
make
light
of
it
,
"
and
I
always
know
she
be
beloved
,
useful
,
and
happy
.
<EOS>
She
repay
me
twenty
-
thousandfold
,
and
twenty
more
to
that
,
every
hour
in
every
day
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
and
oftener
still
,
"
say
I
,
"
she
bless
the
guardian
who
be
a
father
to
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
at
the
word
father
,
I
see
his
former
trouble
come
into
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
subdue
it
as
before
,
and
it
be
go
in
an
instant
;
but
it
have
be
there
<EOS>
and
it
have
come
so
swiftly
upon
my
word
that
I
feel
as
if
they
have
give
him
a
shock
.
 
<EOS>
I
again
inwardly
repeat
,
wonder
,
"
that
I
could
readily
understand
.
 
<EOS>
none
that
I
could
readily
understand
!
"
 
<EOS>
no
,
it
be
true
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
it
.
<EOS>
not
for
many
and
many
a
day
.
   
<EOS>
"
take
a
fatherly
good
night
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
kiss
me
on
the
forehead
,
"
and
so
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
late
hour
for
working
and
thinking
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
that
for
all
of
us
,
all
day
long
,
little
housekeeper
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
neither
work
nor
think
any
more
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
open
my
grateful
heart
to
heaven
in
thankfulness
for
its
providence
to
me
and
its
care
of
me
,
and
fall
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
a
visitor
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Allan
Woodcourt
come
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
to
take
leave
of
us
;
he
have
settle
to
do
so
beforehand
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
China
and
to
India
as
a
surgeon
on
board
ship
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
to
be
away
a
long
,
long
time
.
   
<EOS>
I
believe
---
<EOS>
at
least
I
know
---
that
he
be
not
rich
.
 
<EOS>
all
his
widow
mother
could
spare
have
be
spend
in
qualify
him
for
his
profession
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
lucrative
to
a
young
practitioner
,
with
very
little
influence
in
London
;
and
although
he
be
,
night
and
day
,
at
the
service
of
number
of
poor
people
and
do
wonder
of
gentleness
and
skill
for
them
,
he
gain
very
little
by
it
in
money
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
seven
year
old
than
I.
 
<EOS>
not
that
I
need
mention
it
,
for
it
hardly
seem
to
belong
to
anything
.
   
<EOS>
I
think
---
<EOS>
I
mean
,
he
tell
us
---
that
he
have
be
in
practice
three
or
four
year
and
that
if
he
could
have
hope
to
contend
through
three
or
four
more
,
he
would
not
have
make
the
voyage
on
which
he
be
bind
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
no
fortune
or
private
mean
,
and
so
he
be
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
to
see
us
several
time
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
We
think
it
a
pity
he
should
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
because
he
be
distinguish
in
his
art
among
those
who
know
it
best
,
and
some
of
the
great
man
belong
to
it
have
a
high
opinion
of
him
.
   
<EOS>
when
he
come
to
bid
us
good
-
bye
,
he
bring
his
mother
with
him
for
the
first
time
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
pretty
old
lady
,
with
bright
black
eye
,
but
she
seem
proud
.
 
<EOS>
She
come
from
Wales
and
have
have
,
a
long
time
ago
,
an
eminent
person
for
an
ancestor
,
of
the
name
of
Morgan
ap
-
Kerrig
---
of
some
place
that
sound
like
Gimlet
---
who
be
the
most
illustrious
person
that
ever
be
know
and
all
of
whose
relation
be
a
sort
of
royal
family
.
 
<EOS>
He
appear
to
have
pass
his
life
in
always
get
up
into
mountain
and
fight
somebody
;
and
a
bard
whose
name
sound
like
Crumlinwallinwer
have
sing
his
praise
in
a
piece
which
be
call
,
as
nearly
as
I
could
catch
it
,
Mewlinnwillinwodd
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Woodcourt
,
after
expatiate
to
us
on
the
fame
of
her
great
kinsman
,
say
that
no
doubt
wherever
her
son
Allan
go
he
would
remember
his
pedigree
and
would
on
no
account
form
an
alliance
below
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
tell
him
that
there
be
many
handsome
english
lady
in
India
who
go
out
on
speculation
,
and
that
there
be
some
to
be
pick
up
with
property
,
but
that
neither
charm
nor
wealth
would
suffice
for
the
descendant
from
such
a
line
without
birth
,
which
must
ever
be
the
first
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
She
talk
so
much
about
birth
that
for
a
moment
<EOS>
I
half
fancy
,
and
with
pain
---
 
<EOS>
but
what
an
idle
fancy
to
suppose
that
she
could
think
or
care
what
MINE
be
!
   
<EOS>
Mr
Woodcourt
seem
a
little
distressed
by
her
prolixity
,
but
he
be
too
considerate
to
let
her
see
it
and
contrive
delicately
to
bring
the
conversation
round
to
make
his
acknowledgment
to
my
guardian
for
his
hospitality
and
for
the
very
happy
hour
---
he
call
them
the
very
happy
hour
---
he
have
pass
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
the
recollection
of
them
,
he
say
,
would
go
with
him
wherever
he
go
and
would
be
always
treasure
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
we
give
him
our
hand
,
one
after
another
---
at
least
,
they
do
---
<EOS>
and
I
do
;
and
so
he
put
his
lip
to
Ada
's
hand
---
and
to
mine
;
and
<EOS>
so
he
go
away
upon
his
long
,
long
voyage
!
   
<EOS>
I
be
very
busy
indeed
all
day
and
write
direction
home
to
the
servant
,
and
write
note
for
my
guardian
,
and
dust
his
book
and
paper
,
and
jingle
my
housekeeping
key
a
good
deal
,
one
way
and
another
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
still
busy
between
the
light
,
singe
and
work
by
the
window
,
when
who
should
come
in
<EOS>
but

I

I
repeat

pinch
her

<EOS>
Caddy
only
laugh
in
return
,
and
tell
me
that
she
have
come
for
half
an
hour
,
at
the
expiration
of

Lady
Dedlock
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
so
easy
as
it
have
appear
at
first
to
arrange
for
Richard
's
make
a
trial
of
Mr
Kenge
's
office
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
himself
be
the
chief
impediment
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
have
it
in
his
power
to
leave
Mr
Badger
at
any
moment
,
he
begin
to
doubt
whether
he
want
to
leave
him
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
,
he
say
,
really
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
bad
profession
;
he
could
not
assert
that
he
dislike
it
;
perhaps
he
like
it
as
well
as
he
like
any
other
---
suppose
he
give
it
one
more
chance
!
 
<EOS>
upon
that
,
he
shut
himself
up
for
a
few
week
with
some
book
and
some
bone
and
seem
to
acquire
a
considerable
fund
of
information
with
great
rapidity
.
 
<EOS>
His
fervour
,
after
last
about
a
month
,
begin
to
cool
,
and
when
it
be
quite
cool
,
begin
to
grow
warm
again
.
 
<EOS>
His
vacillation
between
law
and
medicine
last
so
long
that
midsummer
arrive
before
he
finally
separate
from
Mr
Badger
and
enter
on
an
experimental
course
of
Messrs.
Kenge
and
Carboy
.
 
<EOS>
for
all
his
waywardness
,
he
take
great
credit
to
himself
as
be
determine
to
be
in
earnest
"
this
time
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
he
be
so
good
-
natured
throughout
,
and
in
such
high
spirit
,
and
so
fond
of
Ada
,
that
it
be
very
difficult
indeed
to
be
otherwise
than
pleased
with
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
to
Mr
Jarndyce
,
"
who
,
I
may
mention
,
find
the
wind
much
give
,
during
this
period
,
to
stick
in
the
east
;
"
as
to
Mr
Jarndyce
,
"
Richard
would
say
to
me
,
"
he
be
the
fine
fellow
in
the
world
,
Esther
!
 
<EOS>
I
must
be
particularly
careful
,
if
it
be
only
for
his
satisfaction
,
to
take
myself
well
to
task
and
have
a
regular
wind
-
up
of
this
business
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
idea
of
his
take
himself
well
to
task
,
with
that
laugh
face
and
heedless
manner
and
with
a
fancy
that
everything
could
catch
and
nothing
could
hold
,
be
ludicrously
anomalous
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
tell
us
between
-
while
that
he
be
do
it
to
such
an
extent
that
he
wonder
his
hair
do
not
turn
grey
.
 
<EOS>
His
regular
wind
-
up
of
the
business
be
(
as
I
have
say
)
that
he
go
to
Mr
Kenge
's
about
midsummer
to
try
how
he
like
it
.
   
<EOS>
all
this
time
he
be
,
in
money
affair
,
what
I
have
describe
him
in
a
former
illustration
---
generous
,
profuse
,
wildly
careless
,
but
fully
persuade
that
he
be
rather
calculate
and
prudent
.
 
<EOS>
I
happen
to
say
to
Ada
,
in
his
presence
,
half
jestingly
,
half
seriously
,
about
the
time
of
his
go
to
Mr
Kenge
's
,
that
he
need
to
have
Fortunatus
'
purse
,
he
make
so
light
of
money
,
which
he
answer
in
this
way
,
"
My
jewel
of
a
dear
cousin
,
you
hear
this
old
woman
!
 
<EOS>
why
do
she
say
that
?
 
<EOS>
because
I
give
eight
pound
odd
(
or
whatever
it
be
)
for
a
certain
neat
waistcoat
and
button
a
few
day
ago
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
if
I
have
stay
at
Badger
's
I
should
have
be
oblige
to
spend
twelve
pound
at
a
blow
for
some
heart
-
break
lecture
-
fee
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
make
four
pound
---
in
a
lump
---
by
the
transaction
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
question
much
discuss
between
him
and
my
guardian
what
arrangement
should
be
make
for
his
living
in
London
while
he
experiment
on
the
law
,
for
we
have
long
since
go
back
to
Bleak
House
,
and
it
be
too
far
off
to
admit
of
his
come
there
oftener
than
once
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
My
guardian
tell
me
that
if
Richard
be
to
settle
down
at
Mr
Kenge
's
he
would
take
some
apartment
or
chamber
where
we
too
could
occasionally
stay
for
a
few
day
at
a
time
;
"
but
,
little
woman
,
"
he
add
,
rub
his
head
very
significantly
,
"
he
have
not
settle
down
there
yet
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
discussion
end
in
our
hiring
for
him
,
by
the
month
,
a
neat
little
furnished
lodging
in
a
quiet
old
house
near
Queen
Square
.
 
<EOS>
He
immediately
begin
to
spend
all
the
money
he
have
in
buy
the
odd
little
ornament
and
luxury
for
this
lodging
;
and
so
often
as
Ada
and
I
dissuade
him
from
make
any
purchase
that
he
have
in
contemplation
which
be
particularly
unnecessary
and
expensive
,
he
take
credit
for
what
it
would
have
cost
and
make
out
that
to
spend
anything
less
on
something
else
be
to
save
the
difference
.
   
<EOS>
while
these
affair
be
in
abeyance
,
our
visit
to
Mr
Boythorn
's
be
postpone
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
Richard
have
take
possession
of
his
lodging
,
there
be
nothing
to
prevent
our
departure
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
have
go
with
us
at
that
time
of
the
year
very
well
,
but
he
be
in
the
full
novelty
of
his
new
position
and
be
make
most
energetic
attempt
to
unravel
the
mystery
of
the
fatal
suit
.
 
<EOS>
consequently
we
go
without
him
,
and
my
darling
be
delighted
to
praise
him
for
be
so
busy
.
   
<EOS>
We
make
a
pleasant
journey
down
into
Lincolnshire
by
the
coach
and
have
an
entertaining
companion
in
Mr
Skimpole
.
 
<EOS>
His
furniture
have
be
all
clear
off
,
it
appear
,
by
the
person
who
take
possession
of
it
on
his
blue
-
eyed
daughter
's
birthday
,
but
he
seem
quite
relieved
to
think
that
it
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
chair
and
table
,
he
say
,
be
wearisome
object
;
they
be
monotonous
idea
,
they
have
no
variety
of
expression
,
they
look
you
out
of
countenance
,
and
you
look
them
out
of
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
how
pleasant
,
then
,
to
be
bind
to
no
particular
chair
and
table
,
but
to
sport
like
a
butterfly
among
all
the
furniture
on
hire
,
and
to
flit
from
rosewood
to
mahogany
,
and
from
mahogany
to
walnut
,
and
from
this
shape
to
that
,
as
the
humour
take
one
!
   
<EOS>
"
the
oddity
of
the
thing
be
,
"
say
Mr
Skimpole
with
a
quickened
sense
of
the
ludicrous
,
"
that
my
chair
and
table
be
not
pay
for
,
and
yet
my
landlord
walk
off
with
them
as
composedly
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
that
seem
droll
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
grotesque
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
chair
and
table
merchant
never
engage
to
pay
my
landlord
my
rent
.
 
<EOS>
why
should
my
landlord
quarrel
with
him
?
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
a
pimple
on
my
nose
which
be
disagreeable
to
my
landlord
's
peculiar
idea
of
beauty
,
my
landlord
have
no
business
to
scratch
my
chair
and
table
merchant
's
nose
,
which
have
no
pimple
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
His
reasoning
seem
defective
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
my
guardian
good
-
humouredly
,
"
it
be
pretty
clear
that
whoever
become
security
for
those
chair
and
table
will
have
to
pay
for
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
exactly
!
"
return
Mr
Skimpole
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
crowning
point
of
unreason
in
the
business
!
 
<EOS>
I
say
to
my
landlord
,
"
My
good
man
,
you
be
not
aware
that
my
excellent
friend
Jarndyce
will
have
to
pay
for
those
thing
that
you
be
sweep
off
in
that
indelicate
manner
.
 
<EOS>
have
you
no
consideration
for
his
property
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
have
not
the
least
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
and
refuse
all
proposal
,
"
say
my
guardian
.
   
<EOS>
"
refuse
all
proposal
,
"
return
Mr
Skimpole
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
make
him
business
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
him
into
my
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
You
be
a
man
of
business
,
I
believe
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
reply
,
"
I
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
now
let
us
be
business
-
like
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
an
inkstand
,
here
be
pen
and
paper
,
here
be
wafer
.
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
want
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
occupy
your
house
for
a
considerable
period
,
I
believe
to
our
mutual
satisfaction
until
this
unpleasant
misunderstanding
arise
;
let
us
be
at
once
friendly
and
business
-
like
.
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
reply
to
this
,
he
make
use
of
the
figurative
expression
---
which
have
something
Eastern
about
it
---
that
he
have
never
see
the
colour
of
my
money
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
amiable
friend
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
never
have
any
money
.
<EOS>
I
never
know
anything
about
money
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
what
do
you
offer
if
I
give
you
time
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
good
fellow
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
have
no
idea
of
time
;
but
you
say
you
be
a
man
of
business
,
and
whatever
you
can
suggest
to
be
do
in
a
business
-
like
way
with
pen
,
and
ink
,
and
paper
---
and
wafer
<EOS>
---
I
be
ready
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
pay
yourself
at
another
man
's
expense
(
which
be
foolish
)
,
but
be
business
-
like
!
"
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
would
not
be
,
and
there
be
an
end
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
if
these
be
some
of
the
inconvenience
of
Mr
Skimpole
's
childhood
,
it
assuredly
possess
its
advantage
too
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
journey
he
have
a
very
good
appetite
for
such
refreshment
as
come
in
our
way
(
include
a
basket
of
choice
hothouse
peach
)
,
but
never
think
of
pay
for
anything
.
 
<EOS>
so
when
the
coachman
come
round
for
his
fee
,
he
pleasantly
ask
him
what
he
consider
a
very
good
fee
indeed
,
now
---
a
liberal
one
---
and
on
his
reply
half
a
crown
for
a
single
passenger
,
say
it
be
little
enough
too
,
all
thing
consider
,
and
leave
Mr
Jarndyce
to
give
it
him
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
delightful
weather
.
 
<EOS>
the
green
corn
wave
<EOS>
so
beautifully
,
the
lark
sing
so
joyfully
,
the
hedge
be
so
full
of
wild
flower
,
the
tree
be
so
thickly
out
in
leaf
,
the
bean
-
field
,
with
a
light
wind
blow
over
them
,
fill
the
air
with
such
a
delicious
fragrance
!
 
<EOS>
late
in
the
afternoon
we
come
to
the
market
-
town
where
we
be
to
alight
from
the
coach
---
a
dull
little
town
with
a
church
-
spire
,
and
a
marketplace
,
and
a
market
-
cross
,
and
one
intensely
sunny
street
,
and
a
pond
with
an
old
horse
cool
his
leg
in
it
,
and
a
very
few
man
sleepily
lie
and
stand
about
in
narrow
little
bit
of
shade
.
 
<EOS>
after
the
rustling
of
the
leave
and
the
waving
of
the
corn
all
along
the
road
,
it
look
as
still
,
as
hot
,
as
motionless
a
little
town
as
England
could
produce
.
   
<EOS>
at
the
inn
we
find
Mr
Boythorn
on
horseback
,
wait
with
an
open
carriage
to
take
us
to
his
house
,
which
be
a
few
mile
off
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
over
-
joy
to
see
us
and
dismount
with
great
alacrity
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
by
heaven
!
"
say
he
after
give
us
a
courteous
greeting
.
 
<EOS>
this
a
most
infamous
coach
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
most
flagrant
example
of
an
abominable
public
vehicle
that
ever
encumber
the
face
of
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
twenty
-
five
minute
after
its
time
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
the
coachman
ought
to
be
put
to
death
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
be
he
after
his
time
?
"
say
Mr
Skimpole
,
to
whom
he
happen
to
address
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
my
infirmity

"
   
<EOS>
"
twenty

five
minute

<EOS>
twenty

six
minute

reply
Mr
Boythorn
,
refer
to
his
watch
.
 
<EOS>
"
with
two
lady
in
the
coach
,
this
scoundrel
have
deliberately
delay
his
arrival
six
and
twenty
minute
.
 
<EOS>
deliberately
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
that
it
can
be
accidental
!
 
<EOS>
but
his
father
---
and
his
uncle
---
be
the
most
profligate
coachman
that
ever
sit
upon
a
box
.
"
   
<EOS>
while
he
say
this
in
tone
of
the
great
indignation
,
he
hand
us
into
the
little
phaeton
with
the
utmost
gentleness
and
be
all
smile
and
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry

he
say
,
stand
bare

head
at
the
carriage

door

all
be
ready
,
"
that
I
be
oblige
to
conduct
you
nearly
two
mile
out
of
the
way

<EOS>
but
our
direct
road
lie
through
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
's
park
,
and
in
that
fellow
's
property
I
have
swear
never

mine

<EOS>
and
here
,
catch
my
guardian
's
eye
,
he
break
into
one
of
his
tremendous
laugh
,
which
seem
to
shake
even
the
motionless
little
market

town

my

I

not

whatever
can
have
induce
that
transcendent
woman
to
marry
that
effigy

figure

impenetrable
mystery

I

my

<EOS>
"
I

bend
his

to
Ada

me
with
the
smile
politeness
which
sit
so
gracefully
upon
him
,

except
in
the
matter
of

<EOS>
I
be
only
sorry

I

not
have
the
happiness
of
be
their
escort
about
Chesney
Wold
,
which
be
a
very
fine
place
!

by
the
light
of
this
summer
day
,
Jarndyce
,
if
you
call
upon
the
owner
while
you
stay
with
me
,
you
be
likely
to
have

a
cool
reception

He

I
be
to
the
honour

<EOS>
the

perhaps
such
a

a

ruddy
look

but
,
indeed

everything
about
the
place
wear
an
aspect
of
maturity
and
abundance
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
lime

tree

be
like
green
cloister
,
the
very
shadow
of
the
cherry

tree

apple

tree

heavy
with
fruit

the
gooseberry

bush

so
laden
that
their
branch
arch
and
rest
on
the
earth
,
the
strawberry

raspberry
grow
in
like
profusion

the
peach

hundred

<EOS>
tumble
about
among
the
spread
net

the
glass
frame
sparkle
and
wink
in
the
sun
there
be
such
heap
of
droop
pod
,
and
marrow
,
and
cucumber
,
that
every
foot
of
ground
appear
a
vegetable
treasury
,
while
the
smell
of
sweet
herb
and
all
kind
of
wholesome
growth
(
to
say
nothing
of
the
neighbouring
meadow
where
the
hay
be
carry
)
make
the
whole
air
a
great
nosegay
.
 
<EOS>
such
stillness
and
composure
reign
within
the
orderly
precinct
of
the
old
red
wall
that
even
the
feather
hang
in
garland
to
scare
the
bird
hardly
stir
;
and
the
wall
have
such
a
ripening
influence
that
where
,
here
and
there
high
up
,
a
disused
nail
and
scrap
of
list
still
clung
to
it
,
it

easy
to
fancy
that
they
have
mellow
with
the
change
season
and
that
they
have
rust
and
decay
accord
to
the
common
fate
.
   
<EOS>
the
house

a
little
disorderly

with
the

a
real
old
house

We
arrive
at

on

Saturday

<EOS>
on
the
Sunday
morning
we
all
set
forth
to
walk
to
the
little
church
in
the
park

<EOS>
enter
the
park
,
almost
immediately
by
the
dispute
ground
,
we
pursue
a
pleasant
footpath
wind
among
the
verdant
turf
and
the
beautiful
tree
until
it
bring
us
to
the
church
-
porch
.
   
<EOS>
the
congregation
be
extremely
small
and
quite
a
rustic
one
with
the
exception
of
a
large
muster
of
servant
from
the
house
,
some
of
whom
be
already
in
their
seat
,
while
other
be
yet
drop
in
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
some
stately
footman
,
and
there
be
a
perfect
picture
of
an
old
coachman
,
who
look
as
if
he
be
the
official
representative
of
all
the
pomp
and
vanity
that
have
ever
be
put
into
his
coach
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
very
pretty
show
of
young
woman
,
and
above
them
,
the
handsome
old
face
and
fine
responsible
portly
figure
of
the
housekeeper
tower
pre
-
eminent
.
 
<EOS>
the
pretty
girl
of
whom
Mr
Boythorn
have
tell
us
be
close
by
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
so
very
pretty
that
I
may
have
know
her
by
her
beauty
even
if
I
have
not
see
how
blushingly
conscious
she
be
of
the
eye
of
the
young
fisherman
,
whom
I
discover
not
far
off
.
 
<EOS>
one
face
,
and
not
an
agreeable
one
,
though
it
be
handsome
,
seem
maliciously
watchful
of
this
pretty
girl
,
and
indeed
of
every
one
and
everything
there
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
Frenchwoman
's
.
   
<EOS>
as
the
bell
be
yet
ring
and
the
great
people
be
not
yet
come
,
I
have
leisure
to
glance
over
the
church
,
which
smell
as
earthy
as
a
grave
,
and
to
think
what
a
shady
,
ancient
,
solemn
little
church
<EOS>
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
the
window
,
heavily
shade
by
tree
,
admit
a
subdued
light
that
make
the
face
around
me
pale
,
and
darken
the
old
brass
in
the
pavement
and
the
time
and
damp
-
wear
monument
,
and
render
the
sunshine
in
the
little
porch
,
where
a
monotonous
ringer
be
work
at
the
bell
,
inestimably
bright
.
 
<EOS>
but
a
stir
in
that
direction
,
a
gathering
of
reverential
awe
in
the
rustic
face
,
and
a
blandly
ferocious
assumption
on
the
part
of
Mr
Boythorn
of
be
resolutely
unconscious
of
somebody
's
existence
forewarn
me
that
the
great
people
be
come
and
that
the
service
be
go
to
begin
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
enter
not
into
judgment
with
thy
servant
,
o
Lord
,
for
in
thy
sight
---
"
"
   
Shall
I
ever
forget
the
rapid
beating
at
my
heart
,
occasion
by
the
look
I
meet
as
I
stand
up
!
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
ever
forget
the
manner
in
which
those
handsome
proud
eye
seem
to
spring
out
of
their
languor
and
to
hold
mine
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
a
moment
before
I
cast
mine
down
---
release
again
,
if
I
may
say
so
---
on
my
book
;
but
I
know
the
beautiful
face
quite
well
in
that
short
space
of
time
.
   
<EOS>
and
,
very
strangely
,
there
be
something
quicken
within
me
,
associate
with
the
lonely
day
at
my
godmother
's
;
<EOS>
yes
,
away
even
to
the
day
when
I
have
stand
on
tiptoe
to
dress
myself
at
my
little
glass
after
dress
my
doll
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
,
although
I
have
never
see
this
lady
's
face
before
in
all
my
life
---
I
be
quite
sure
of
it
---
 
<EOS>
absolutely
certain
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
know
that
the
ceremonious
,
gouty
,
grey
-
haired
gentleman
,
the
only
other
occupant
of
the
great
pew
,
be
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
,
and
that
the
lady
be
Lady
Dedlock
.
 
<EOS>
but
why
her
face
should
be
,
in
a
confused
way
,
like
a
broken
glass
to
me
,
in
which
I
see
scrap
of
old
remembrance
,
and
why
I
should
be
so
fluttered
and
trouble
(
for
I
be
still
)
by
have
casually
meet
her
eye
,
I
could
not
think
.
   
<EOS>
I
feel
it
to
be
an
unmeaning
weakness
in
me
and
try
to
overcome
it
by
attend
to
the
word
I
hear
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
very
strangely
,
I
seem
to
hear
them
,
not
in
the
reader
's
voice
,
but
in
the
well
-
remember
voice
of
my
godmother
.
 
<EOS>
this
make
me
think
,
do
Lady
Dedlock
's
face
accidentally
resemble
my
godmother
's
?
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
it
do
,
a
little
;
but
the
expression
be
so
different
,
and
the
stern
decision
which
have
wear
into
my
godmother
's
face
,
like
weather
into
rock
,
be
so
completely
want
in
the
face
before
me
that
it
could
not
be
that
resemblance
which
have
strike
me
.
 
<EOS>
neither
<EOS>
do
I
know
the
loftiness
and
haughtiness
of
Lady
Dedlock
's
face
,
at
all
,
in
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
---
I
,
little
Esther
Summerson
,
the
child
who
live
a
life
apart
and
on
whose
birthday
there
be
no
rejoicing
---
seem
to
arise
before
my
own
eye
,
evoke
out
of
the
past
by
some
power
in
this
fashionable
lady
,
whom
I
not
only
entertain
no
fancy
that
I
have
ever
see
,
but
whom
I
perfectly
well
know
I
have
never
see
until
that
hour
.
   
<EOS>
It
make
me
tremble
so
to
be
throw
into
this
unaccountable
agitation
that
I
be
conscious
of
be
distress
even
by
the
observation
of
the
french
maid
,
though
I
know
she
have
be
look
watchfully
here
,
and
there
,
and
everywhere
,
from
the
moment
of
her
come
into
the
church
.
 
<EOS>
by
degree
,
though
very
slowly
,
I
at
last
overcame
my
strange
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
long
time
,
I
look
towards
Lady
Dedlock
again
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
while
they
be
prepare
to
sing
,
before
the
sermon
.
 
<EOS>
She
take
no
heed
of
me
,
and
the
beating
at
my
heart
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
neither
do
it
revive
for
more
than
a
few
moment
when
she
once
or
twice
afterwards
glance
at
Ada
or
at
me
through
her
glass
.
   
<EOS>
the
service
be
conclude
,
Sir
Leicester
give
his
arm
with
much
taste
and
gallantry
to
Lady
Dedlock
---
though
he
be
oblige
to
walk
by
the
help
of
a
thick
stick
---
and
escort
her
out
of
church
to
the
pony
carriage
in
which
they
have
come
.
 
<EOS>
the
servant
then
disperse
,
and
so
do
the
congregation
,
whom
Sir
Leicester
have
contemplate
all
along
<EOS>
(
Mr
Skimpole
say
to
Mr
Boythorn

infinite
delight

why
should
you
take

<EOS>
here
be
I

content
to
receive
thing
childishly
as
they
fall
out

I
never
take
trouble

I
come
down
here

for

up

I
expand

I
open

I
turn

just
the

then

I

I

delighted

congratulate
you
heartily

<EOS>
but
I
know
nothing
about
it
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
;
for
I
be
a
mere
child

I
lay
no
claim

it

I
do
not
want
it

"
 
<EOS>
so
,
you
see
,
<EOS>
excellent
Boythorn
and
<EOS>
I
would
go
to
dinner
after
all
!
"
   
<EOS>
this
be
one
of
many
little
dialogue
between
them
which
I
always
expect
to
end
,
and
which
I
dare
say
would
have
end
under
other
circumstance
,
in
some
violent
explosion
on
the
part
of
our
host
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
so
high
a
sense
of
his
hospitable
and
responsible
position
as
our
entertainer
,
and
my
guardian
laugh
so
sincerely
at
and
with
Mr
Skimpole
,
as
a
child
who
blow
bubble
and
break
them
all
day
long
,
that
matter
never
go
beyond
this
point
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Skimpole
,
who
always
seem
quite
unconscious
of
have
be
on
delicate
ground
,
then
betook
himself
to
begin
some
sketch
in
the
park
which
be
never
finish
,
or
to
play
fragment
of
air
on
the
piano
,
or
to
singe
scrap
of
song
,
or
to
lie
down
on
his
back
under
a
tree
and
look
at
the
sky
---
which
he
could
not
help
think
,
he
say
,
be
what
he
be
mean
for
;
it
suit
him
so
exactly
.
   
<EOS>
"
enterprise
and
effort
<EOS>
,
"
he
would
say
to
us
(
on
his
back
)
,
be
delightful
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
be
truly
cosmopolitan
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
the
deep
sympathy
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
lie
in
a
shady
place
like
this
and
think
of
adventurous
spirit
go
to
the
North
Pole
or
penetrate
to
the
heart
of
the
Torrid
Zone
with
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
Mercenary
creature
ask
,
"
what
be
the
use
of
a
man
be
go
to
the
North
Pole
?
<EOS>
what
good
do
it
do
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
;
<EOS>
but
,
for
anything
I
CAN
say
,
he
may
go
for
the
purpose
---
though
he
do
not
know
it
---
of
employ
my
thought
as
I
lie
here
.
 
<EOS>
take
an
extreme
case
.
 
<EOS>
take
the
case
of
the
slave
on
american
plantation
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
they
be
work
hard
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
they
do
not
altogether
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
theirs
be
an
unpleasant
experience
on
the
whole
;
but
they
people
the
landscape
for
me
,
they
give
it
a
poetry
for
me
,
and
perhaps
that
be
one
of
the
pleasanter
object
of
their
existence
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
sensible
of
it
,
if
it
be
,
and
I
should
not
wonder
if
it
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
always
wonder
on
these
occasion
whether
he
ever
think
of
Mrs
Skimpole
and
the
child
,
and
in
what
point
of
view
they
present
themselves
to
his
cosmopolitan
mind
.
 
<EOS>
so
far
as
I
could
understand
,
they
rarely
present
themselves
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
the
week
have
go
round
to
the
Saturday
follow
that
beating
of
my
heart
in
the
church
;
and
every
day
have
be
so
bright
and
blue
that
to
ramble
in
the
wood
,
and
to
see
the
light
strike
down
among
the
transparent
leave
and
sparkle
in
the
beautiful
interlacing
of
the
shadow
of
the
tree
,
while
the
bird
pour
out
their
song
and
the
air
be
drowsy
with
the
hum
of
insect
,
have
be
most
delightful
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
one
favourite
spot
,
deep
in
moss
and
last
year
's
leave
,
where
there
be
some
fell
tree
from
which
the
bark
be
all
strip
off
.
 
<EOS>
seat
among
these
,
we
look
through
a
green
vista
support
by
thousand
of
natural
column
,
the
whitened
stem
of
tree
,
upon
a
distant
prospect
make
so
radiant
by
its
contrast
with
the
shade
in
which
we
sit
and
make
so
precious
by
the
arched
perspective
through
which
we
see
it
that
it
be
like
a
glimpse
of
the
well
land
.
 
<EOS>
upon
the
Saturday
we
sit
here
,
Mr
Jarndyce
,
Ada
,
and
I
,
until
we
hear
thunder
muttering
in
the
distance
and
feel
the
large
raindrop
rattle
through
the
leave
.
   
<EOS>
the
weather
have
be
all
the
week
extremely
sultry
,
but
the
storm
break
so
suddenly
---
upon
us
,
at
least
,
in
that
sheltered
spot
---
that
before
we
reach
the
outskirt
of
the
wood
the
thunder
and
lightning
be
frequent
and
the
rain
come
plunge
through
the
leave
as
if
every
drop
be
a
great
leaden
bead
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
not
a
time
for
stand
among
tree
,
we
run
out
of
the
wood
,
and
up
and
down
the
moss
-
grow
step
which
cross
the
plantation
-
fence
like
two
broad
-
stave
ladder
place
back
to
back
,
and
make
for
a
keeper
's
lodge
which
be
close
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
often
notice
the
dark
beauty
of
this
lodge
stand
in
a
deep
twilight
of
tree
,
and
how
the
ivy
cluster
over
it
,
and
how
there
be
a
steep
hollow
near
,
where
we
have
once
see
the
keeper
's
dog
dive
down
into
the
fern
as
if
it
be
water
.
   
<EOS>
the
lodge
be
so
dark
within
,
now
the
sky
be
overcast
,
that
we
only
clearly
see
the
man
who
come
to
the
door
when
we
take
shelter
there
and
put
two
chair
for
Ada
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
lattice
-
window
be
all
throw
open
,
and
we
sit
just
within
the
doorway
watch
the
storm
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
grand
to
see
how
the
wind
awake
,
and
bent
the
tree
,
and
drive
the
rain
before
it
like
a
cloud
of
smoke
;
and
to
hear
the
solemn
thunder
and
to
see
the
lightning
;
and
while
think
with
awe
of
the
tremendous
power
by
which
our
little
life
be
encompass
,
to
consider
how
beneficent
they
be
and
how
upon
the
small
flower
and
leaf
there
be
already
a
freshness
pour
from
all
this
seeming
rage
which
seem
to
make
creation
new
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
it
not
dangerous
to
sit
in
so
expose
a
place
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
Esther
dear
!
"
say
Ada
quietly
.
   
<EOS>
Ada
say
it
to
me
,
but
I
have
not
speak
.
   
<EOS>
the
beating
of
my
heart
come
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
hear
the
voice
,
as
I
have
never
see
the
face
,
but
it
affect
me
in
the
same
strange
way
.
 
<EOS>
again
,
in
a
moment
,
there
arise
before
my
mind
innumerable
picture
of
myself
.
   
<EOS>
Lady
Dedlock
have
take
shelter
in
the
lodge
before
our
arrival
there
and
have
come
out
of
the
gloom
within

<EOS>
She
stand
behind
my
chair
with
her
hand
upon
it

<EOS>
I

her
with

close

<EOS>
She
have
give

her

in
an
indifferent
way
that
seem
habitual
to
her

speak
in
a
correspondingly
indifferent
manner

in

pleasant

She

graceful

it
worth

the

conciliate
him

there
be
something
very
win

She
slightly

admiring
notice

breathe
stertorously
with

Mr

Halloa

it

smouldering

that
limited
portion

its
contingency
have
no
claim

<EOS>
He
dwell
in
a
little
narrow
street
,
always
solitary
,
shady
,
and
sad
,
closely
bricke
in
on
all
side
like
a
tomb

but
where
there

linger
the
stump
of
an
old
forest
tree
whose
flavour
be
about
as
fresh
and
natural
as
the
Smallweed
smack
of
youth
.
   
<EOS>
there
have
be
only
one
child

little

weak
in
her
intellect
and
fall
(
for
the
first
time
)
into
a
childish
state
.
 
<EOS>
with
such
infantine
grace
as
a
total
want
of
observation
,
memory
,
understanding
,
and
interest
,
and
an
eternal
disposition
to
fall
asleep
over
the
fire

into

It

a

small
collection
of
the
hard

<EOS>
in

reverence
,
wonder
,
and
other
such
phrenological
attribute
,
it
be
no
bad
off
than
it
use

<EOS>
everything
that
Mr

put
away

<EOS>
Judy
the
twin
be
worthy
company
for
these
associate
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
so
indubitably
sister
to
Mr
Smallweed
<EOS>
the
young
that
the
two
knead
into
one
would
hardly
make
a
young
person
of
average
proportion
,
while
she
so
happily
exemplify
the
before
-
mention
family
likeness
to
the
monkey
tribe
that
attire
in
a
spangled
robe
and
cap
she
may
walk
about
the
table
-
land
on
the
top
of
a
barrel
-
organ
without
exciting
much
remark
as
an
unusual
speciman
.
 
<EOS>
under
exist
circumstance
,
however
,
she
be
dress
in
a
plain
,
spare
gown
of
brown
stuff
.
   
<EOS>
Judy
never
own
a
doll
,
never
hear
of
Cinderella
,
never
play
at
any
game
.
 
<EOS>
She
once
or
twice
fall
into
child
's
company
when
she
be
about
ten
year
old
,
but
the
child
could
not
get
on
with
Judy
,
and
Judy
could
not
get
on
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
seem
like
an
animal
of
another
specie
,
and
there
be
instinctive
repugnance
on
both
side
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
doubtful
whether
Judy
know
how
to
laugh
.
<EOS>
She
have
so
rarely
see
the
thing
do
that
the
probability
be
strong
the
other
way
.
 
<EOS>
of
anything
like
a
youthful
laugh
,
she
certainly
can
have
no
conception
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
be
to
try
one
,
she
would
find
her
tooth
in
her
way
,
model
that
action
of
her
face
,
as
she
have
unconsciously
model
all
its
other
expression
,
on
her
pattern
of
sordid
age
.
 
<EOS>
such
be
Judy
.
   
<EOS>
and
her
twin
brother
could
not
wind
up
a
top
for
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
no
more
of
Jack
the
Giant
Killer
or
of
Sinbad
the
Sailor
than
he
know
of
the
people
in
the
star
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
as
soon
play
at
leap
-
frog
or
at
cricket
as
change
into
a
cricket
or
a
frog
himself
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
so
much
the
well
off
than
his
sister

on
his
narrow
world
of
fact
an
opening
have
dawn
into
such
broad
region
as
lie
within
the
ken
of
Mr
Guppy
.
 
<EOS>
hence
his
admiration
and
his
emulation
of
that
shine
enchanter
.
   
<EOS>
Judy

with

His

firstly
because
the

generally
twist

him
an
air
of
goblin
rakishness

secondly
because
he
mutter
violent
imprecation

because
the
contrast

suggestive
of

very
wicked

Esther
's
Narrative
 
<EOS>
We
come
home
from
Mr
Boythorn
's
after
six
pleasant
week
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
often
in
the
park
and
in
the
wood
and
seldom
pass
the
lodge
where
we
have
take
shelter
without
look
in
to
speak
to
the
keeper
's
wife
;
but
we
see
no
more
of
Lady
Dedlock
,
except
at
church
on
Sundays
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
company
at
Chesney
Wold
;
and
although
several
beautiful
face
surround
her
,
her
face
retain
the
same
influence
on
me
as
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
quite
know
even
now
whether
it
be
painful
or
pleasurable
,
whether
it
draw
me
towards
her
or
make
me
shrink
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
admire
her
with
a
kind
of
fear
,
and
I
know
that
in
her
presence
my
thought
always
wander
back
,
as
they
have
do
at
first
,
to
that
old
time
of
my
life
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
a
fancy
,
on
more
than
one
of
these
Sundays
,
that
what
this
lady
so
curiously
be
to
me
,
I
be
to
her
---
<EOS>
I
mean
that
I
disturb
her
thought
as
she
influence
mine
,
though
in
some
different
way
.
<EOS>
but
when
I
steal
a
glance
at
her
and
see
her
so
compose
and
distant
and
unapproachable
,
I
feel
this
to
be
a
foolish
weakness
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
feel
the
whole
state
of
my
mind
in
reference
to
her
to
be
weak
and
unreasonable
,
and
I
remonstrate
with
myself
about
it
as
much
as
I
could
.
   
<EOS>
one
incident
that
occur
before
we
quit
Mr
Boythorn
's
house
,
I
have
well
mention
in
this
place
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
walk
in
the
garden
with
Ada
and
<EOS>
when
I
be
tell
that
some
one
wish
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
go
into
the
breakfast
-
room
where
this
person
be
wait
,
I
find
it
to
be
the
french
maid
who
have
cast
off
her
shoe
and
walk
through
the
wet
grass
on
the
day
when
it
thunder
and
lighten
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
,
"
she
begin
,
look
fixedly
at
me
with
her
too
-
eager
eye
,
though
otherwise
present
an
agreeable
appearance
and
speak
neither
with
boldness
nor
servility
,
"
I
have
take
a
great
liberty
in
come
here
,
but
you
know
how
to
excuse
it
,
be
so
amiable
,
mademoiselle
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
excuse
be
necessary
,
"
I
return
,
"
if
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
my
desire
,
mademoiselle
.
 
<EOS>
a
thousand
thank
for
the
permission
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
your
leave
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
not
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
in
a
quick
,
natural
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
,
you
be
so
amiable

<EOS>
listen
then
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
leave
my
Lady
.
 
<EOS>
We
could
not
agree
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lady
be
so
high
,
so
very
high
.
 
<EOS>
Pardon
!
 
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
,
you
be
right
!
"
 
<EOS>
Her
quickness
anticipate
what
I
may
have
say
presently
<EOS>
but
as
yet
have
only
think
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
for
me
to
come
here
to
complain
of
my
Lady
.
<EOS>
but
I
say
she
be
so
high
,
so
very
high
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
a
word
more

the

go
on

if
you
please

I.
   
<EOS>
"
assuredly
;
mademoiselle

I
be
thankful
for
your
politeness

<EOS>
Mademoiselle
,
I
have
an
inexpressible
desire

find
service
with
a
young
lady
who

good

accomplished

beautiful

<EOS>
You

good

ah

I

the
honour

your

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
---
"
I
begin
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
dismiss
me
so
soon
,
mademoiselle
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
with
an
involuntary
contraction
of
her
fine
black
eyebrow
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
me
hope
a
moment
!
 
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
<EOS>
,
I
know
this
service
would
be
more
retired
than
that
which
I
have
quit
.
 
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
I
wish
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
this
service
would
be
less
distinguished
than
that
which
I
have
quit

<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
I
wish
that
,
I
know
that
I
should
win
less

as
to

here

good
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
content
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
"
say
I
,
quite
embarrassed
by
the
mere
idea
of
have
such
an
attendant
,
"
that
I
keep
no
maid
---
"
   
"
ah
,
mademoiselle
,
but
why
not
?
 
<EOS>
why
not

when
you
can
have
one
so
devoted
to
you

<EOS>
who
would
be
enchant
to

would
be
so
true

so
zealous

so
faithful

<EOS>
Mademoiselle

I
wish
with
all
my
heart
to
serve
you

<EOS>
do
not
speak
of
money
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
take
me
as
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
for
nothing
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
be
so
singularly
earnest
that
I
draw
back
,
almost
afraid
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
without
appear
to
notice
it
,
in
her
ardour
she
still
press
herself
upon
me
,
speak
in
a
rapid
subdued
voice
,
though
always
with
a
certain
grace
and
propriety
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
,
I
come
from
the
south
country
where
we
be
quick
and
where
we
like
and
dislike
very
strong
.
 
<EOS>
My
Lady
be
too
high

high

I

well

You

not
know
how
well

"
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
lower
energy
in
her
face
as
she
stand
look
at
me
while
I
explain
the
impossibility
of
my
engagmg
her
(
without
think
it
necessary
to
say
how
very
little
I
desire
to
do
so
)
,
which
seem
to
bring
visibly
before
me
some
woman
from
the
street
of
Paris
in
the
reign
of
terror
.
   
<EOS>
She
hear
me
out
without
interruption
and
then
say
with
her
pretty
accent
and
in
her
mild
voice
,
"
hey
,
mademoiselle
,
I
have
receive
my
answer
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
of
it

<EOS>
but
I
must
go
elsewhere
and
seek
what
I
have
not
find
here
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
graciously
let
me
kiss
your
hand
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
look
at
me
more
intently
as
she
take
it
,
and
seem
to
take
note
,
with
her
momentary
touch
,
of
every
vein
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
I
surprise
you
,
mademoiselle
,
on
the
day
of
the
storm
?

"
she
say
with
a
part
curtsy
.
   
<EOS>
I
confess
that
she
have
surprise
us
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
take
an
oath
,
mademoiselle

"
she
say
,
smile
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
want
to
stamp
it
on
my
mind
so
that
I
may
keep
it
faithfully
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
will
!
 
<EOS>
Adieu
,
mademoiselle

"
   
<EOS>
so
end
our
conference
,
which
I
be
very
glad
to
bring
to
a
close
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
go
away
from
the
village
,
<EOS>
for
I
see
her
no
more
;
and
nothing
else
occur
to
disturb
our
tranquil
summer
pleasure
until
six
week
be
out

we
return
home

the
evening
with
us
and
ride
back
again
early
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
as
vivacious
as
ever
and
tell
us
he
be
very
industrious
,
but
I
be
not
easy
in
my
mind
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
appear
to
me
that
his
industry
be
all
misdirect
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
find
that
it
lead
to
anything
<EOS>
but
the
formation
of
delusive
hope
in
connexion
with
the
suit
already
the
pernicious
cause
of
so
much
sorrow
and
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
get
at
the
core
of
that
mystery
now
,
he
tell
us
,
and
nothing
could
be
plain
than
that
the
will
under
which
he
and
Ada
be
to
take
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
many
thousand
of
pound
must
be
finally
establish
if
there
be
any
sense
or
justice
in
the
Court
of
Chancery
---
<EOS>
but
oh
,
what
a
great
if
that
sound
in
my
ear
---
and
that
this
happy
conclusion
could
not
be
much
longer
delay
.
 
<EOS>
He
prove
this
to
himself
by
all
the
weary
argument
on
that
side
he
have
read
,
and
every
one
of
them
sink
him
deeper
in
the
infatuation
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
even
begin
to
haunt
the
court
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
us
how
he
see
Miss
Flite
there
daily
,
how
they
talk
together
,
and
how
he
do
her
little
kindness
,
and
how
,
while
he
laugh
at
her
,
he
pity
her
from
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
never
think
---
<EOS>
never
,
my
poor
,
dear
,
sanguine
Richard
,
capable
of
so
much
happiness
then
,
and
with
such
well
thing
before
him
---
 
<EOS>
what
a
fatal
link
be
rivet
between
his
fresh
youth
and
her
fade
age
,
between
his
free
hope
and
her
cage
bird
,
and
her
hungry
garret
,
and
her
wander
mind
.
   
<EOS>
Ada
love
him
too
well
to
mistrust
him
much
in
anything
he
say
or
do
,
and
my
guardian
,
though
he
frequently
complain
of
the
east
wind
and
read
more
than
usual
in
the
growlery
,
preserve
a
strict
silence
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
think
one
day
when
I
go
to
London
to
meet
Caddy
Jellyby
,
at
her
solicitation
,
I
would
ask
Richard
to
be
in
wait
for
me
at
the
coach
-
office
,
that
we
may
have
a
little
talk
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
him
there
when
I
arrive
,
and
we
walk
away
arm
in
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
Richard
,
"
say
I
as
soon
as
I
could
begin
to
be
grave
with
him
,
"
be
you
begin
to
feel
more
settled
now
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
,
my
dear
!
"
return
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
all
right
enough
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
but
settle
?
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
mean
,
settle
?
"
return
Richard
with
his
gay
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
"
settle
in
the
law
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
aye
,
"
reply
Richard
,
"
I
be
all
right
enough
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
say
that
before
,
my
dear
Richard
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
and
you
do
not
think
it
be
an
answer
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
not
.
<EOS>
settle
?
 
<EOS>
You
mean
,
do
I
feel
as
if
I
be
settle
down
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
no
,
I
can
not
say
I
be
settle
down
,
"
say
Richard
,
strongly
emphasize
"
down
,
"
as
if
that
express
the
difficulty
,
"
because
one
can
not
settle
down
while
this
business
remain
in
such
an
unsettled
state
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
say
this
business
,
of
course
I
mean
the
---
 
forbidden
subject
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
it
will
ever
be
in
a
settle
state
?
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
not
the
least
doubt
of
it
,
"
answer
Richard
.
   
<EOS>
We
walk
a
little
way
without
speak
,
and
presently
Richard
address
me
in
his
frank
and
most
feeling
manner
,
thus
:
"
<EOS>
My
dear
esther
,
I
understand
you
,
and
I
wish
to
heaven
<EOS>
I
be
a
more
constant
sort
of
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
constant
to
Ada
,
for
I
love
her
dearly
---
well
and
well
every
day
---
but
constant
to
myself
.
<EOS>
(
somehow
,
I
mean
something
that
I
can
not
very
well
express
,
but
you
will
make
it
out
.
)
 
<EOS>
if
I
be
a
more
constant
sort
of
fellow
,
I
should
have
hold
on
either
to
Badger
or
to
Kenge
and
Carboy
like
grim
death
,
and
should
have
begin
to
be
steady
and
systematic
by
this
time
,
and
should
not
be
in
debt
,
and
---
"
   
"
are
you
in
debt
,
Richard
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Richard
,
"
I
be
a
little
so
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
also
,
I
have
take
rather
too
much
to
billiard
and
that
sort
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
now
the
murder
be
out
;
you
despise
me
,
Esther
,
do
not
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
do
not
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
kind
to
me
than
I
often
be
to
myself
,
"
he
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
esther
,
I
be
a
very
unfortunate
dog
not
to
be
more
settle
,
but
how
CAN
I
be
more
settle
?
 
<EOS>
if
you
live
in
an
unfinished
house
,
you
could
not
settle
down
in
it
;
if
you
be
condemn
to
leave
everything
you
undertake
unfinished
,
you
would
find
it
hard
to
apply
yourself
to
anything
;
and
yet
that
be
my
unhappy
case
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
bear
into
this
unfinished
contention
with
all
its
chance
and
change
,
and
it
begin
to
unsettle
me
before
I
quite
know
the
difference
between
a
suit
at
law
and
a
suit
of
clothe
;
and
it
have
go
on
unsettle
me
ever
since
;
and
here
I
be
now
,
conscious
sometimes
that
I
be
but
a
worthless
fellow
to
love
my
confide
cousin
Ada
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
We
be
in
a
solitary
place
,
and
he
put
his
hand
before
his
eye
and
sob
as
he
say
the
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Richard
!
"
say
I.
 
"
do
not
be
so
move
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
a
noble
nature
,
and
Ada
's
love
may
make
you
worthy
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
my
dear
,
"
he
reply
,
press
my
arm
,
"
I
know
all
that
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
mind
my
be
a
little
soft
now
,
for
I
have
have
all
this
upon
my
mind
for
a
long
time
,
and
have
often
mean
to
speak
to
you
,
and
have
sometimes
want
opportunity
and
sometimes
courage
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
the
thought
of
Ada
ought
to
do
for
me
,
but
it
do
not
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
too
unsettled
even
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
her
most
devotedly
,
and
yet
I
do
her
wrong
,
in
do
myself
wrong
,
every
day
and
hour
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
can
not
last
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
come
on
for
a
final
hearing
and
get
judgment
in
our
favour
,
and
then
you
and
Ada
shall
see
what
I
can
really
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
have
give
me
a
pang
to
hear
him
sob
and
see
the
tear
start
out
between
his
finger
,
but
that
be
infinitely
less
affect
to
me
than
the
hopeful
animation
with
which
he
say
these
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
look
well
into
the
paper
,
Esther
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
deep
in
them
for
month
,
"
he
continue
,
recover
his
cheerfulness
in
a
moment
,
"
and
you
may
rely
upon
it
that
we
shall
come
out
triumphant
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
year
of
delay
,
there
have
be
no
want
of
them
,
heaven
know
!
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
the
great
probability
of
our
bring
the
matter
to
a
speedy
close
;
in
fact
,
it
be
on
the
paper
now
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
all
right
at
last
,
and
then
you
shall
see
!
"
   
<EOS>
recall
how
he
have
just
now
place
Messrs.
Kenge
and
Carboy
in
the
same
category
with
Mr
Badger
<EOS>
,
I
ask
him
when
he
intend
to
be
article
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
   
<EOS>
"
there
again
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
not
at
all
,
Esther
,
"
he
return
with
an
effort
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
I
have
have
enough
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
have
work
at
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
like
a
galley
slave
,
I
have
slake
my
thirst
for
the
law
and
satisfy
myself
that
I
should
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
find
it
unsettle
me
more
and
more
to
be
so
constantly
upon
the
scene
of
action
.
 
<EOS>
so
what
,
"
continue
Richard
,
confident
again
by
this
time
,
"
do
I
naturally
turn
my
thought
to
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
imagine
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
do
not
look
so
serious
,
"
return
Richard
,
"
because
it
be
the
good
thing
I
can
do
,
my
dear
Esther
,
I
be
certain
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
as
if
I
want
a
profession
for
life
.
 
<EOS>
these
proceeding
will
come
to
a
termination
,
and
then
I
be
provide
for
.
 
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
upon
it
as
a
pursuit
which
be
in
its
nature
more
or
less
unsettled
,
and
therefore
suited
to
my
temporary
condition
---
I
may
say
,
precisely
suited
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
it
that
I
naturally
turn
my
thought
to
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
look
at
him
and
shake
my
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
,
"
say
Richard
,
in
a
tone
of
perfect
conviction
,
"
but
the
army
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
the
army
?
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
the
army
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
what
I
have
to
do
be
to
get
a
commission
;
and
---
there
I
be
,
you
know
!
<EOS>
"
say
Richard
.
   
<EOS>
and
then
he
show
me
,
prove
by
elaborate
calculation
in
his
pocket
-
book
,
that
supposing
he
have
contract
,
say
,
two
hundred
pound
of
debt
in
six
month
out
of
the
army
;
and
that
he
contract
no
debt
at
all
within
a
corresponding
period
in
the
army
---
as
to
which
he
have
quite
make
up
his
mind
;
this
step
must
involve
a
saving
of
four
hundred
pound
in
a
year
,
or
two
thousand
pound
in
five
year
,
which
be
a
considerable
sum
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
speak
so
ingenuously
and
sincerely
of
the
sacrifice
he
make
in
withdraw
himself
for
a
time
from
Ada
,
and
of
the
earnestness
with
which
he
aspire
---
<EOS>
as
in
thought
he
always
do
,
I
know
full
well
---
to
repay
her
love
,
and
to
ensure
her
happiness
,
and
to
conquer
what
be
amiss
in
himself
,
and
to
acquire
the
very
soul
of
decision
,
that
he
make
my
heart
ache
keenly
,
sorely
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
I
think
,
how
would
this
end
<EOS>
,
how
could
this
end
,
when
so
soon
and
so
surely
all
his
manly
quality
be
touch
by
the
fatal
blight
that
ruin
everything
it
rest
on
!
   
<EOS>
I
speak
to
Richard
with
all
the
earnestness
I
feel
,
and
all
the
hope
I
could
not
quite
feel
then
,
and
implore
him
for
Ada
's
sake
not
to
put
any
trust
in
Chancery
.
 
<EOS>
to
all
I
say
,
Richard
readily
assent
,
ride
over
the
court
and
everything
else
in
his
easy
way
and
draw
the
bright
picture
of
the
character
he
be
to
settle
into
---
alas
,
when
the
grievous
suit
should
loose
its
hold
upon
him
!
 
<EOS>
We
have
a
long
talk
,
but
it
always
come
back
to
that
,
in
substance
.
   
<EOS>
at
last
we
come
to
Soho
Square
,
where
Caddy
Jellyby
have
appoint
to
wait
for
me
,
as
a
quiet
place
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Newman
Street
.
 
<EOS>
Caddy
be
in
the
garden
in
the
centre
and
hurry
out
as
soon
as
I
appear
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
few
cheerful
word
,
Richard
leave
us
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
Prince
have
a
pupil
over
the
way
,
Esther
,
"
say
Caddy
,
"
and
get
the
key
for
us
.
 
<EOS>
so
if
you
will
walk
round
and
round
here
with
me
,
we
can
lock
ourselves
in
<EOS>
and
I
can
tell
you
comfortably
what
I
want
to
see
your
dear
good
face
about
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
my
dear
,
"
say
I.
 
"
nothing
could
be
well
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
Caddy
,
after
affectionately
squeeze
the
dear
good
face
as
she
call
it
,
lock
the
gate
,
and
take
my
arm
,
and
we
begin
to
walk
round
the
garden
very
cosily
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Esther
,
"
say
Caddy
,
who
thoroughly
enjoy
a
little
confidence
,
"
after
you
speak
to
me
about
its
be
wrong
to
marry
without
Ma
's
knowledge
,
or
even
to
keep
Ma
long
in
the
dark
respect
our
engagement
---
though
I
do
not
believe
Ma
care
much
for
me
<EOS>
,
I
must
say
---
I
think
it
right
to
mention
your
opinion
to
Prince
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
because
I
want
to
profit
by
everything
you
tell
me
,
and
in
the
second
place
because
I
have
no
secret
from
Prince
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
approve
,
Caddy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
my
dear
!
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
he
would
approve
of
anything
you
could
say
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
no
idea
what
an
opimon
he
have
of
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
esther
,
it
be
enough
to
make
anybody
but
me
jealous
,
"
say
Caddy
,
laugh
and
shake
her
head
;
"
but
it
only
make
me
joyful
,
for
you
be
the
first
friend
I
ever
have
,
and
the
good
friend
I
ever
can
have
,
and
nobody
can
respect
and
love
you
too
much
to
please
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
Caddy
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
be
in
the
general
conspiracy
to
keep
me
in
a
good
humour
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
I
be

he
have
his

the
occasion
,
that
I
tell
Caddy
we
must
really
go
to
Thavies
Inn
at
once
if
we
be
to
go
at
all
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
so
we
take
our
departure
after
a
very
loving
farewell
between
Caddy
and
her
betroth
,
and
during
our
walk
she
be
so
happy
and
so
full
of
old
Mr
Turveydrop
's
praise
that
I
would
not
have
say
a
word
in
his
disparagement
for
any
consideration
.
   
<EOS>
the
house
in
Thavies
Inn
have
bill
in
the
window
annouce
that
it
be
to
let
,
and
it
look
dirty
and
gloomy
and
ghastly
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
the
name
of
poor
Mr
Jellyby
have
appear
in
the
list
of
bankrupt
but
a
day
or
two
before
,
and
he
be
shut
up
in
the
dining
-
room
with
two
gentleman
and
a
heap
of
blue
bag
,
account
-
book
,
and
paper
,
make
the
most
desperate
endeavour
to
understand
his
affair
.
 
<EOS>
They
appear
to
me
to
be
quite
beyond
his
comprehension
,
for
when
Caddy
take
me
into
the
dining
-
room
by
mistake
and
we
come
upon
Mr
Jellyby
in
his
spectacle
,
forlornly
fence
into
a
corner
by
the
great
dining
-
table
and
the
two
gentleman
,
he
seem
to
have
give
up
the
whole
thing
and
to
be
speechless
and
insensible
.
   
<EOS>
go
upstairs
to
Mrs
Jellyby
's
room
(
the
child
be
all
scream
in
the
kitchen
,
and
there
be
no
servant
to
be
see
)
<EOS>
,
we
find
that
lady
in
the
midst
of
a
voluminous
correspondence
,
opening
,
reading
,
and
sort
letter
,
with
a
great
accumulation
of
torn
cover
on
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
so
preoccupied
that
at
first
she
do
not
know
me
,
though
she
sit
look
at
me
with
that
curious
,
bright
-
eyed
,
far
-
off
look
of
hers
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
Miss
Summerson
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
say
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
think
of
something
so
different
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
be
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
happy
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jarndyce
and
Miss
Clare
quite
well
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
hope
in
return
that
Mr
Jellyby
be
quite
well
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
not
quite
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Mrs
Jellyby
in
the
calm
manner
.
<EOS>
"
He
have
be
unfortunate
in
his
affair
and
be
a
little
out
of
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
happily
for
me
,
I
be
so
much
engaged
that
I
have
no
time
to
think
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
,
at
the
present
moment
,
one
hundred
and
seventy
family
,
Miss
Summerson
,
average
five
person
in
each
,
either
go
or
go
to
the
left
bank
of
the
Niger
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
think
of
the
one
family
so
near
us
who
be
neither
go
nor
go
to
the
left
bank
of
the
Niger
,
and
wonder
how
she
could
be
so
placid
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
bring
Caddy
back
<EOS>
,
I
see
,
"
observe
Mrs
Jellyby
with
a
glance
at
her
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
have
become
quite
a
novelty
to
see
her
here

<EOS>
She
have
almost
desert
her
old

fact
oblige
me
to
employ

I

I

Caddy

<EOS>
"
I

Mrs

still

cast

smilingly
over

<EOS>
if

it

Mrs

sweetly
cast
her
eye
for
a
moment
on
me
and
consider
where
to
put
the
particular
letter
she
have
just
open

this
would
distress

disappoint

I
have
so
much
to

entreaty

and
as
Mrs
Jellyby
be

far
away
into
Africa
straight
through
my
bonnet

I
think
it
a
good
opportunity

come
to
the
subject

attention

interpose
between

Mrs

no

I
may
have
expect
it

that
I
do
not

seem
equally
at
a
loss

occasionally

you

such
question
after

"
You
be

nonsensical
child

have
do
anything

Mrs

a
degenerate
child

when

step

clear
off

heavy

afternoon
post
come
in

<EOS>
I
think
I
could
not
do
better
than
take
my
leave
;
I
be
detain
for
a
moment
by
Caddy
's
saying
,

You
will
not

to
my
bring

oh
,
dear
me
,

Mrs

distant
contemplation

have
you

again

whom

<EOS>
"
Him
,
Ma

"
   
<EOS>
"
Caddy
,
Caddy
!
"
say
Mrs

quite
weary
of
such
little
matter

<EOS>
"
then
you
must
bring
him
some
evening
which
be
not
a
Parent
Society
night
,
or
a
Branch
night
,
or
a
Ramification
night
.
<EOS>
You
must
accommodate
the
visit
to
the
demand
upon
my
time
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Miss
Summerson
,
it
be
very
kind
of
you
to
come
here
to
help
out
this
silly
chit
.
 
<EOS>
good
-
bye
!
 
<EOS>
when
I
tell
you
that
I
have
fifty
-
eight
new
letter
from
manufacture
family
anxious
to
understand
the
detail
of
the
native
and
coffee
-
cultivation
question
this
morning
,
I
need
not
apologize
for
have
very
little
leisure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
not
surprise
by
Caddy
's
be
in
low
spirit
when
we
go
downstairs
,
or
by
her
sob
afresh
on
my
neck
,
or
by
her
say
she
would
far
rather
have
be
scold
than
treat
with
such
indifference
,
or
by
her
confide
to
me
that
she
be
so
poor
in
clothe
that
how
she
be
ever
to
be
marry
creditably
she
do
not
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
gradually
cheer
her
up
by
dwell
on
the
many
thing
she
would
do
for
her
unfortunate
father
and
for
Peepy
when
she
have
a
home
of
her
own
;
and
finally
we
go
downstairs
into
the
damp
dark
kitchen
,
where
Peepy
and
his
little
brother
and
sister
be
grovel
on
the
stone
floor
and
where
we
have
such
a
game
of
play
with
them
that
to
prevent
myself
from
be
quite
tear
to
piece
I
be
oblige
to
fall
back
on
my
fairy
-
tale
.
 
<EOS>
from
time
to
time
I
hear
loud
voice
in
the
parlour
overhead
,
and
occasionally
a
violent
tumbling
about
of
the
furniture
.
 
<EOS>
the
last
effect
I
be
afraid
be
cause
by
poor
Mr
Jellyby
's
break
away
from
the
dining
-
table
and
making
rush
at
the
window
with
the
intention
of
throw
himself
into
the
area
whenever
he
make
any
new
attempt
to
understand
his
affair
.
   
<EOS>
as
I
ride
quietly
home
at
night
after
the
day
's
bustle
,
I
think
a
good
deal
of
Caddy
's
engagement
and
feel
confirm
in
my
hope
(
in
spite
of
the
elder
Mr
Turveydrop
)
that
she
would
be
the
happy
and
well
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
there
seem
to
be
but
a
slend
chance
of
her
and
her
husband
ever
find
out
what
the
model
of
deportment
really
be
,
why
that
be
all
for
the
good
too
,
and
who
would
wish
them
to
be
wise
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
wish
them
to
be
any
wise
and
indeed
be
half
ashamed
of
not
entirely
believe
in
him
myself
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
look
up
at
the
star
,
and
think
about
traveller
in
distant
country
and
the
star
they
see
,
and
hope
I
may
always
be
so
blest
and
happy
as
to
be
useful
to
some
one
in
my
small
way
.
   
<EOS>
They
be
so
glad
to
see
me
when
I
get
home
,
as
they
always
be
,
that
I
could
have
sit
down
and
cry
for
joy
if
that
have
not
be
a
method
of
make
myself
disagreeable
.
 
<EOS>
everybody
in
the
house
,
from
the
low
to
the
high
,
show
me
such
a
bright
face
of
welcome
,
and
speak
so
cheerily
,
and
be
so
happy
to
do
anything
for
me
,
that
I
suppose
there
never
be
such
a
fortunate
little
creature
in
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
We
get
into
such
a
chatty
state
that
night
,
through
Ada
and
my
guardian
draw
me
out
to
tell
them
all
about
Caddy
,
that
I
go
on
prose
,
prose
,
prose
for
a
length
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
get
up
to
my
own
room
,
quite
red
to
think
how
I
have
be
hold

Chapter
24
.
<EOS>
an
appeal
case
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Richard
and
I
have
hold
the
conversation
of
which
I
have
give
an
account
,
Richard
communicate
the
state
of
his
mind
to
Mr
Jarndyce
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
if
my
guardian
be
altogether
take
by
surprise
when
he
receive
the
representation
,
though
it
cause
him
much
uneasiness
and
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
Richard
be
often
closet
together
,
late
at
night
and
early
in
the
morning
,
and
pass
whole
day
in
London
,
and
have
innumerable
appointment
with
Mr
Kenge
,
and
labour
through
a
quantity
of
disagreeable
business
.
 
<EOS>
while
they
be
thus
employ
,
my
guardian
,
though
he
undergo
considerable
inconvenience
from
the
state
of
the
wind
and
rub
his
head
so
constantly
that
not
a
single
hair
upon
it
ever
rest
in
its
right
place
,
be
as
genial
with
Ada
and
me
as
at
any
other
time
,
but
maintain
a
steady
reserve
on
these
matter
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
our
utmost
endeavour
could
only
elicit
from
Richard
himself
sweeping
assurance
that
everything
be
go
on
capitally
and
that
it
really
be
all
right
at
last
,
our
anxiety
be
not
much
relieve
by
him
.
   
<EOS>
We
learn
,
however
,
as
the
time
go
on
,
that
a
new
application
be
make
to
the
Lord
Chancellor
on
Richard
's
behalf
as
an
infant
and
a
ward
,
and
I
do
not
know
what
,
and
that
there
be
a
quantity
of
talking
,
and
that
the
Lord
Chancellor
describe
him
in
open
court
as
a
vexatious
and
capricious
infant
,
and
that
the
matter
be
adjourn
and
readjourne
,
and
refer
,
and
report
on
,
and
petition
about
until
Richard
begin
to
doubt
(
as
he
tell
us
)
<EOS>
whether
,
if
he
enter
the
army
at
all
,
it
would
not
be
as
a
veteran
of
seventy
or
eighty
year
of
age
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
an
appointment
be
make
for
him
to
see
the
Lord
Chancellor
again
in
his
private
room
,
and
there
the
Lord
Chancellor
very
seriously
reprove
him
for
trifle
with
time
and
not
know
his
mind
---
"
a
pretty
good
joke
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
"
say
Richard
,
"
from
that
quarter
!
"
<EOS>
---
and
at
last
it
be
settle
that
his
application
should
be
grant
.
 
<EOS>
His
name
be
enter
at
the
Horse
Guards
as
an
applicant
for
an
ensign
's
commission
;
the
purchase
-
money
be
deposit
at
an
agent
's
;
and
Richard
,
in
his
usual
characteristic
way
,
plunge
into
a
violent
course
of
military
study
and
get
up
at
five
o'clock
every
morning
to
practise
the
broadsword
exercise
.
   
<EOS>
thus
,
vacation
succeed
term
,
and
term
succeed
vacation
.
 
<EOS>
We
sometimes
hear
of
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
as
be
in
the
paper
or
out
of
the
paper
,
or
as
be
to
be
mention
,
or
as
be
to
be
speak
to
;
and
it
come
on
,
and
it
go
off
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
,
who
be
now
in
a
professor
's
house
in
London
,
be
able
to
be
with
us
less
frequently
than
before
;
my
guardian
still
maintain
the
same
reserve
;
and
so
time
pass
until
the
commission
be
obtain
and
Richard
receive
direction
with
it
to
join
a
regiment
in
Ireland
.
   
<EOS>
He
arrive
post
-
haste
with
the
intelligence
one
evening
,
and
have
a
long
conference
with
my
guardian

<EOS>
Upwards
of
an
hour
elapse
before
my
guardian
put
his
head
into
the
room
where
Ada

I
be

We

<EOS>
"

"
Cousin
Richard

"

Ada
then
,
raise
her
blue
eye
tenderly
to
his
face
,
"
after
what
our
cousin
John
have
say
<EOS>
,
I
think
no
choice
be
leave
us
.
 
<EOS>
Your
mind
<EOS>
may
he
quite
at
ease
about
me
,
for
you
will
leave
me
here
under
his
care
and
will
be
sure
that
I
can
have
nothing
to
wish
for
---
quite
sure
if
I
guide
myself
by
his
advice
.
<EOS>
I
---
I
do
not
doubt
,
cousin
Richard
,
"
say
Ada
,
a
little
confused
,
"
that
you
be
very
fond
of
me
,
and
I
<EOS>
---
I
do
not
think
you
will
fall
in
love
with
anybody
else
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
should
like
you
to
consider
well
about
it
too
,
as
I
should
like
you
to
be
in
all
thing
very
happy
.
<EOS>
You
may
trust
in
me
,
cousin
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
at
all
changeable
;
but
I
be
not
unreasonable
,
and
should
never
blame
you
.
 
<EOS>
even
cousin
may
be
sorry
to
part
;
and
in
truth
I
be
very
,
very
sorry
,
Richard
,
though
I
know
it
be
for
your
welfare
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
always
think
of
you
affectionately
,
and
often
talk
of
you
with
Esther
,
and
---
and
perhaps
you
will
sometimes
think
a
little
of
me
,
cousin
Richard
.
<EOS>
so
now
,
"
say
Ada
,
go
up
to
him
and
give
him
her
tremble
hand
,
"
we
be
only
cousin
again
,
Richard
---
for
the
time
perhaps
---
 
<EOS>
and
I
pray
for
a
blessing
on
my
dear
cousin
,
wherever
he
go
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
strange
to
me
that
Richard
should
not
be
able
to
forgive
my
guardian
for
entertain
the
very
same
opinion
of
him
which
he
himself
have
express
of
himself
in
much
strong
term
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
certainly
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
I
observe
with
great
regret
that
from
this
hour
he
never
be
as
free
and
open
with
Mr
Jarndyce
as
he
have
be
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
every
reason
give
him
to
be
so
,
but
he
be
not
;
and
solely
on
his
side
,
an
estrangement
begin
to
arise
between
them
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
business
of
preparation
and
equipment
he
soon
lose
himself
,
and
even
his
grief
at
part
from
Ada
,
who
remain
in
Hertfordshire
while
he
,
Mr
Jarndyce
,
and
I
go
up
to
London
for
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
He
remember
her
by
fit
and
start
,
even
with
burst
of
tear
,
and
at
such
time
would
confide
to
me
the
heavy
self
-
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
a
few
minute
he
would
recklessly
conjure
up
some
undefinable
mean
by
which
they
be
both
to
be
make
rich
and
happy
for
ever
,
and
would
become
as
gay
as
possible
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
busy
time
,
and
I
trot
about
with
him
all
day
long
,
buy
a
variety
of
thing
of
which
he
stand
in
need
.
 
<EOS>
of
the
thing
he
would
have
buy
if
he
have
be
leave
to
his
own
way
I
say
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
perfectly
confidential
with
me
,
and
often
talk
so
sensibly
and
feelingly
about
his
fault
and
his
vigorous
resolution
,
and
dwelt
so
much
upon
the
encouragement
he
derive
from
these
conversation
that
I
could
never
have
be
tired
if
I
have
try
.
   
<EOS>
there
use
,
in
that
week
,
to
come
backward
and
forward
to
our
lodging
to
fence
with
Richard
a
person
who
have
formerly
be
a
cavalry
soldier
;
he
be
a
fine
bluff
-
looking
man
,
of
a
frank
free
bearing
,
with
whom
Richard
have
practise
for
some
month
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
so
much
about
him
,
not
only
from
Richard
,
but
from
my
guardian
too
,
that
I
be
purposely
in
the
room
with
my
work
one
morning
after
breakfast
when
he
come
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
good
morning

down

"
   
<EOS>
He
sit
down
,
a
little
disconcert
by
my
presence
,
I
think
,
and
without
look
at
me
,
draw
his
heavy
sunburnt
hand
across
and
across
his
upper
lip
.
   
<EOS>
"
You

my

<EOS>
"
pretty
good

he
reply
,
fold
his
arm
upon

broad
chest
and
look
very
large

Mr
Carstone
be
to
give
his
full
mind

it

he
would
come
out
very
good

He
do
at
first

redden
a
little
through

and

forward

akimbo

guardian
a
good
day
,
and
strode
heavily
out
of
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
the
morning
of
the
day
appoint
for
Richard
's
departure
.
<EOS>
We
have
no
more
purchase
to
make
now
;
I
have
complete
all
his
packing
early
in
the
afternoon
;
and
our
time
be
disengage
until
night
,
when
he
be
to
go
to
Liverpool
for
Holyhead
.
 
<EOS>
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
be
again
expect
to
come
on
that
day
,
Richard
propose
to
me
that
we
should
go
down
to
the
court
and
hear
what
pass
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
his
last
day
,
and
he
be
eager
to
go
,
and
I
have
never
be
there
<EOS>
,
I
give
my
consent
and
we
walk
down
to
Westminster
,
where
the
court
be
then
sit
.
 
<EOS>
We
beguile
the
way
with
arrangement
concern
the
letter
that
Richard
be
to
write
to
me
and
the
letter
that
I
be
to
write
to
him
and
with
a
great
many
hopeful
project
.
 
<EOS>
My
guardian
know
where
we
be
go
and
therefore
be
not
with
us
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
the
court
,
there
be
the
Lord
Chancellor
---
the
same
whom
I
have
see
in
his
private
room
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
---
sit
in
great
state
and
gravity
on
the
bench
,
with
the
mace
and
seal
on
a
red
table
below
him
and
an
immense
flat
nosegay
,
like
a
little
garden
,
which
scent
the
whole
court
.
 
<EOS>
below
the
table
,
again
,
be
a
long
row
of
solicitor
,
with
bundle
of
paper
on
the
matting
at
their
foot
;
and
then
there
be
the
gentleman
of
the
bar
in
wig
and
gown
---
some
awake
and
some
asleep
,
and
one
talking
,
and
nobody
pay
much
attention
to
what
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
the
Lord
Chancellor
lean
back
in
his
very
easy
chair
with
his
elbow
on
the
cushioned
arm
and
his
forehead
rest
on
his
hand
;
some
of
those
who
be
present
doze
;
some
read
the
newspaper
;
some
walk
about
or
whisper
in
group
:
all
seem
perfectly
at
their
ease
,
by
no
mean
in
a
hurry
,
very
unconcerned
,
and
extremely
comfortable
.
   
<EOS>
to
see
everything
go
on
so
smoothly
and
to
think
of
the
roughness
of
the
suitor
'
life
and
death
;
to
see
all
that
full
dress
and
ceremony
and
to
think
of
the
waste
,
and
want
,
and
beggared
misery
it
represent
;
to
consider
that
while
the
sickness
of
hope
defer
be
rage
in
so
many
heart
this
polite
show
go
calmly
on
from
day
to
day
,
and
year
to
year
,
in
such
good
order
and
composure
;
to
behold
the
Lord
Chancellor
and
the
whole
array
of
practitioner
under
him
look
at
one
another
and
at
the
spectator
as
if
nobody
have
ever
hear
that
all
over
England
<EOS>
the
name
in
which
they
be
assemble
be
a
bitter
jest
,
be
hold
in
universal
horror
,
contempt
,
and
indignation
,
be
know
for
something
so
flagrant
and
bad
that
little
short
of
a
miracle
could
bring
any
good
out
of
it
to
any
one
---
this
be
so
curious
and
self
-
contradictory
to
me
,
who
have
no
experience
of
it
,
that
it
be
at
first
incredible
,
and
I
could
not
comprehend
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
where
Richard
put
me
,
and
try
to
listen
,
and
look
about
me
;
but
there
seem
to
be
no
reality
in
the
whole
scene
except
poor
little
Miss
Flite
,
the
madwoman
,
stand
on
a
bench
and
nodding
at
it
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Flite
soon
espy
us
and
come
to
where
we
sit
.
 
<EOS>
She
give
me
a
gracious
welcome
to
her
domain
and
indicate
,
with
much
gratification
and
pride
,
its
principal
attraction
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Kenge
also
come
to
speak
to
us
and
do
the
honour
of
the
place
in
much
the
same
way
,
with
the
bland
modesty
of
a
proprietor
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
very
good
day
for
a
visit
,
he
say
;
he
would
have
prefer
the
first
day
of
term
;
but
it
be
impose
,
it
be
impose
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
have
be
there
half
an
hour
or
so
,
the
case
in
progress
---
if
I
may
use
a
phrase
so
ridiculous
in
such
a
connexion
---
seem
to
die
out
of
its
own
vapidity
,
without
come
,
or
be
by
anybody
expect
to
come
,
to
any
resuit
.
 
<EOS>
the
Lord
Chancellor
then
throw
down
a
bundle
of
paper
from
his
desk
to
the
gentleman
below
him
,
and
somebody
say
,
"
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
.
"
 
<EOS>
upon
this
there
be
a
buzz
,
and
a
laugh
,
and
a
general
withdrawal
of
the
bystander
,
and
a
bringing
in
of
great
heap
,
and
pile
,
and
bag
and
bag
full
of
paper
.
   
<EOS>
I
think
it
come
on
"
for
further
direction
"
---
about
some
bill
of
cost
,
to
the
good
of
my
understanding
,
which
be
confuse
enough
.
<EOS>
but
I
count
twenty
-
three
gentleman
in
wig
who
say
they
be
"
in
it
,
"
and
none
of
them
appear
to
understand
it
much
well
than
I.
They
chat
about
it
with
the
Lord
Chancellor
,
and
contradict
and
explain
among
themselves
,
and
some
of
them
say
it
be
this
way
,
and
some
of
them
say
it
be
that
way
,
and
some
of
them
jocosely
propose
to
read
huge
volume
of
affidavit
,
and
there
be
more
buzzing
and
laughing
,
and
everybody
concerned
be
in
a
state
of
idle
entertainment
,
and
nothing
could
be
make
of
it
by
anybody
.
<EOS>
after
an
hour
or
so
of
this
,
and
a
good
many
speech
be
begin
and
cut
short
,
it
be
"
refer
back
for
the
present
,
"
as
Mr
Kenge
say
,
and
the
paper
be
bundle
up
again
before
the
clerk
have
finish
bring
them
in
.
   
<EOS>
I
glance
at
Richard
on
the
termination
of
these
hopeless
proceeding
and
be
shocked
to
see
the
worn
look
of
his
handsome
young
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
last
for
ever
,
Dame
Durden
.
 
<EOS>
well
luck
next
time
!
<EOS>
"
be
all
he
say
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
see
Mr
Guppy
bring
in
paper
and
arrange
them
for
Mr
Kenge
;
and
he
have
see
me
and
make
me
a
forlorn
bow
,
which
render
me
desirous
to
get
out
of
the
court
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
have
give
me
his
arm
and
be
take
me
away
when
Mr
Guppy
come
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr
Carstone
,
"
say
he
in
a
whisper
,
"
and
Miss
Summerson
's
also
,
but
there
be
a
lady
here
,
a
friend
of
mine
,
who
know
her
and
wish
to
have
the
pleasure
of
shake
hand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
I
see
before
me
,
as
if
she
have
start
into
bodily
shape
from
my
remembrance
,
Mrs
Rachael
of
my
godmother
's
house
.
   
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
do
,
Esther
?
"
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
recollect
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
give
her
my
hand
and
tell
her
yes
and
that
she
be
very
little
alter
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
you
remember
those
time
,
Esther
,
"
she
return
with
her
old
asperity
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
be

.
 
<EOS>
well

<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
see
you
,
and
glad
you
be
not
too
proud
to
know
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
indeed
she
seem
disappointed
that
I
be
not
.
   
<EOS>
"
proud
,
Mrs
Rachael
!
<EOS>
"
I
remonstrate
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
married
,
Esther

"
she
return
,
coldly
correct
me
,
"
and
be
Mrs
Chadband
.
 
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
I
wish
you
good
day
,
and
I
hope
you
will
do
well
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Guppy
,
who
have
be
attentive
to
this
short
dialogue
,
heave
a
sigh
in
my
ear
and
elbow
his
own
and
Mrs
Rachael
's
way
through
the
confused
little
crowd
of
people
come
in
and
go
out
,
which
we
be
in
the
midst
of
and
which
the
change
in
the
business
have
bring
together
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
and
I
be
make
our
way
through
it
,
and
I
be
yet
in
the
first
chill
of
the
late
unexpected
recognition
when
I
see
,
come
towards
us
,
but
not
see
us
,
no
less
a
person
than
Mr
George
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
nothing
of
the
people
about
him
as
he
tramp
on
,
stare
over
their
head
into
the
body
of
the
court
.
   
<EOS>
"
George
!
<EOS>
"
say
Richard
as
I
call
his
attention
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
"
and

<EOS>
Could

<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
these
place
.
"
   
<EOS>
turn
as
he
speak
and
make
an
easy
way
for
us
<EOS>
,
he
stop
when
we
be
out
of
the
press
in
a
corner
behind
a
great
red
curtain
.
   
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
little
crack
old
woman
,
"
he
begin
,
"
that
---
"
   
I
put
up
my
finger
,
for
Miss
Flite
be
close
by
me
,
have
keep
beside
me
all
the
time
and
have
call
the
attention
of
several
of
her
legal
acquaintance
to
me
(
as
I
have
overhear
to
my
confusion
)
by
whisper
in
their
ear
,
"
Hush
!
 
<EOS>
Fitz
Jarndyce
on
my
left
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
hem

"
say
Mr
George
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
remember
,
miss
,
that
we
pass
some
conversation
on
a
certain
man
this
morning
?
 
<EOS>
Gridley
,
"
in
a
low
whisper
behind
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
He
be
hide
at
my
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
mention
it
.
 
<EOS>
have
not

<EOS>
He
be
on
his
last
march

,
and
have
a
whim
to
see
her

<EOS>
He
say
they
can
feel
for
one
another
,
and
she
have
be
almost
as
good
as
a
friend
to
him
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
down
to
look
for
her
,
for
when
I
sit
by
Gridley
this
afternoon
<EOS>
,
I
seem
to
hear
the
roll
of
the
muffled
drum
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
tell
her
?
"
say
<EOS>
I.
   
"
Would
you
be
so
good
?
"
<EOS>
he
return
with
a
glance
of
something
like
apprehension
at
Miss
Flite
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
providence
I
meet
you
,
miss
;
I
doubt
if
I
should
have
know
how
to
get
on
with
that
lady
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
he
put
one
hand
in
his
breast
and
stand
upright
in
a
martial
attitude
as
I
inform
little
Miss
Flite
,
in
her
ear
,
of
the
purport
of
his
kind
errand
.
   
<EOS>
"

she
whisper
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
Poor
Miss
Flite
deem
it
necessary
to
be
so
courtly
and
polite
,
as
a
mark
of
her
respect
for
the
army
,
and
to
curtsy
so
very
often
that
it
be
no
easy
matter
to

<EOS>
when
this

do

and
address
Mr

so
respectfully

not

that
I
could
not
make
up
my

especially
as
Miss

be
always
tractable
with
me
and
as
she
too

"
Fitz
Jarndyce

my

<EOS>
as
Richard
seem
quite
willing

and
even
anxious
,
that
we
should
see
them
safely
to
their
destination

we
agree
to

so

<EOS>
and
as
Mr

inform
us
that
Gridley
's
mind
have
run
on
Mr
Jarndyce
all
the
afternoon
after
hearing
of
their

I

a
hasty
note
in

to
my

<EOS>
Mr

seal
it
at

house

that
it
may
lead
to
no
discovery

<EOS>
We
then
take
a
hackney

coach

We

this
opportunity

light
conversation

ask

if
I

afraid

as

ask
Richard

consider
the
good

tell
him
in

it

We

<EOS>
the
mass

Cook

courtier

in
their
usual
state
of
mind

no
well

no
bad

but
Mr
Snagsby

and
his
little

<EOS>
for
Tom

in
harness
themselves
,
a

of
ungovernable
courser

to
the
chariot
of
Mr

's
imagination
;
and
Mr

;
and
the
passenger

Jo

Mr
Tulkinghorn

and
the
complete
equipage
whirl
though
the
law

stationery
business
at
wild

all
round
the
clock

<EOS>
even
in
the
little
front
kitchen
where
the
family
meal
be
take
,
it
rattle
away
at
a
smoking
pace
from
the
dinner

table
,
when
Mr
Snagsby
pause
in
carve
the
first
slice
of
the
leg
of
mutton
bake
with
potato
and
stare
at

Mr

that
he
have
have
to

<EOS>
something

wrong
somewhere

but
what
something

what
may
come
of
it
,
to
whom
,
when
,
and
from
which
unthought
of
and
unheard

the

<EOS>
His

coronet
,
the
star
and
garter
,
that
sparkle
through
the

dust

whom
all
the
Inns
of
Court
,
all
Chancery
Lane

and
all
the
legal
neighbourhood
agree
to
hold
in
awe
;
his
remembrance
of
Detective
Mr
Bucket
with
his
forefinger
and
his
confidential
manner
,
impossible
to
be
evade
or
decline
,
persuade
him
that
he
be
a
party
to
some
dangerous
secret
without
know
what
it
be

<EOS>
and
it
be
the
fearful
peculiarity

this
condition
that
,
at

life
,
at
any
opening

the
shop

pull

at

explode

blow
up
---
<EOS>
Mr
Bucket
only
know
whom

<EOS>
for
which
reason

whenever
a
man
unknown

into
the
shop
(
as
many
man
unknown
do
)
and
say
,
"
be

or
word

that
innocent
effect

Mr
Snagsby
's
heart
knock
hard
at
his
guilty
breast
.
 
<EOS>
He
undergo
so
much
from
such
inquiry
that
when
they
be
make
by

he
revenge
himself
by
flip
at
their
ear
over
the
counter
and
ask
the
young
dog
what
they
mean
by
it
<EOS>
and
why
they
can
not
speak
out
at
once
?
 
<EOS>
More
impracticable
man
and
boy
persist
in
walk
into
Mr
Snagsby
's
sleep
and
terrify
him
with
unaccountable
question
,
so
that
often
when
the
cock

the
little
dairy
in
Cursitor
Street
break
out
in
his
usual
absurd
way
about
the
morning
,
Mr
Snagsby
find
himself
in
a
crisis
of
nightmare
,
with
his
little
woman
shake
him
and

the

fast
a
tender
double

which
her
sharpness
be
ever
ready
to
twist
out
of
his
head
,
give
Mr
Snagsby
,
in
her
dentistical
presence
,
much
of
the
air
of
a
dog
who
have
a
reservation
from
his
master
and
will
look
anywhere
rather
than
meet
his
eye
.
   
<EOS>
these
various

mark
by
the
little

They
impel

Mr

whether

"
thirdly
,
you
can
judge
for

"
say
Mr

,
suddenly
hand
him
some
sheet
of
write
paper
tie
together

so

"
repeat
Mr

<EOS>
all
three
repetition
Mr
George
pronounce
in
a
mechanical
manner
,
look
straight
at
Mr
Tulkinghorn
;
nor
do
he
so
much
as
glance
at
the
affidavit
in
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
,
that
have
be
give
to
him
for
his
inspection
(
though
he
still
hold
it
in
his
hand
)
,
but
continue
to
look
at
the
lawyer
with
an
air
of
troubled
meditation
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
?
"
say
Mr
Tulkinghorn
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir

"
reply
Mr

,
rise
erect
and
look
immense
,
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
,
if
you
will
excuse
me
,
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tulkinghorn
,
outwardly
quite
undisturbed
,
demand
,
"
<EOS>
why
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
sir
,
"
return
the
trooper
.
 
<EOS>
"
except
on
military
compulsion
,
I
be
not
a
man
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
among
civilian
I
be
what
they
call
in
Scotland
a
ne'er
-
do
-
weel
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
head
for
paper
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
stand
any
fire
better
than
a
fire
of
cross
question
.
 
<EOS>
I
mention
to
Mr
Smallweed
,
only
an
hour
or
so
ago
,
that
when
I
come
into
thing
of
this
kind
I
feel
as
if
I
be
be
smother
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
be
my
sensation
,
"
say
Mr
George
,
look
round
upon
the
company
,
"
at
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
with
that
,
he
take
three
stride
forward
to
replace
the
paper
on
the
lawyer
's
table
and
three
stride
backward
to
resume
his
former
station
,
where
he
stand
perfectly
upright
,
now
look
at
the
ground
and
now
at
the
paint
ceillhg
,
with
his
hand
behind
him
as
if
to
prevent
himself
from
accept
any
other
document
whatever
.
   
<EOS>
under
this
provocation
,
Mr
Smallweed
's
favourite
adjective
of
disparagement
be
so
close
to
his
tongue
that
he
begin
the
word
"
my
dear
friend
"
with
the
monosyllable
"
brim
,
"
thus
convert
the
possessive
pronoun
into
brimmy
and
appear
to
have
an
impediment
in
his
speech
.
 
<EOS>
once
past
this
difficulty
,
however
,
he
exhort
his
dear
friend
in
the
tender
manner
not
to
be
rash
,
but
to
do
what
so
eminent
a
gentleman
require
,
and
to
do
it
with
a
good
grace
,
confident
that
it
must
be
unobjectionable
as
well
as
profitable
.
<EOS>
Mr
Tulkinghorn
merely
utter
an
occasional
sentence
,
as
,
<EOS>
"
You
be
the
good
judge
of
your
own
interest
,
sergeant
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
take
care
<EOS>
you
do
no
harm
by
this
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
please
yourself
,
please
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
know
what
you
mean
,
that
be
quite
enough
.
"
 
<EOS>
these
he
utter
with
an
appearance
of
perfect
indifference
as
he
look
over
the
paper
on
his
table
and
prepare
to
write
a
letter
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
George
look
distrustfully
from
the
paint
ceiling
to
the
ground
,
from
the
ground
to
Mr
Smallweed
,
from
Mr
Smallweed
to
Mr
Tulkinghorn
,
and
from
Mr
Tulkinghorn
to
the
paint
ceiling
again
,
often
in
his
perplexity
change
the
leg
on
which
he
rest
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
assure
you
,
sir
,
"
say
Mr
George
,
"
not

say
it
offensively

I
be
not

match
for
you
gentleman

<EOS>
Will
you
allow
me
to
ask
why
you
want
to
see
the
captain
's
hand
,
in
the
case
that
I
could
find
any
speciman
of
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tulkinghorn
quietly
shake
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
be
a
man
of
business
,
sergeant
,
you
would
not
need
to
be
inform
that
there
be
confidential
reason
,
very
harmless
in
themselves
,
for
many
such
want
in
the
profession
to
which
I
belong
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
you
be
afraid
of
do
any
injury
to
Captain
Hawdon
,
you
may
set
your
mind
at
rest
about
that
.

quietly
sit
down
to
write

<EOS>
"
well

"
say
the
trooper
,
look
into
his
hat
after
another
disconcert
pause
,
"
I
be
sorry
not

have
give
you
more
satisfaction

<EOS>
if
it
would
be
any
satisfaction
to
any
one

I
should
be

in
my
judgment

I
would
rather
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
by
a
friend

mine

a
well
head
for
business

I

hopelessly
across
his
brow

<EOS>
Mr
Smallweed

hear
that
this
authority
be
an
old
soldier

so
strongly
inculcate
the
expediency
of
the
trooper

counsel
with
him

and
particularly
inform
him
of
its
be
a
question
of
five
guinea

I
will
take
the
liberty

It

He

and
the
cold

damp
steal
into
Chesney
Wold
,
though
well
defended

and
eke
into
Sir
Leicester
's
bone

<EOS>
the

hence

It

truth
that

indeed
great

among

the
happy

however
(

genteel

not
profitable

they

be
of
the
Dedlock

so
they
visit
their

get
into

shabbily
when
they
can

the

and
ride

so

the

they

everybody
on
Sir

Dedlock

side
of
the

would

<EOS>
from
my
Lord

through

down
to
Noodle

Sir
Leicester

like
a
glorious
spider

stretch
his
thread
of
relationship

<EOS>
but
while
he
be
stately
in
the
cousinship
of
the
Everybodys
,
he
be
a
kind
and
generous
man
,
accord
to
his
dignified
way
,
in
the
cousinship
of
the
Nobodys
;
and
at
the
present
time

in
despite
of
the
damp
,
he
stay
out
the
visit
of
several
such
cousin
at
Chesney
Wold
with
the
constancy
of
a
martyr

<EOS>
of
these
,
foremost
in
the
front
rank
stand
Volumnia
Dedlock
,
a
young
lady
(

who
be
doubly
highly
relate

have
the
honour
to
be
a
poor
relation

by

side

to
another
great

<EOS>
Miss
Volumnia

display
in

a
pretty
talent
for
cut
ornament
out
of
coloured
paper
,
and
also
for
singe
to
the
guitar
in
the
spanish
tongue
,
and
propound
french
conundrum
in
country
house
,
pass
the
twenty
year
of
her
existence
between
twenty

forty
in
a
sufficiently
agreeable
manner
.
 
<EOS>
lapse
then
out
of
date
and
be
consider
to
bore
mankind
by
her
vocal
performance
in
the
spanish

<EOS>
,
she
retire
to
Bath
,
where
she
live
slenderly
on
an
annual
present
from
Sir

and
whence
<EOS>
she
make
occasional
resurrection
in
the
country
house
of
her
cousin

<EOS>
She
have
an
extensive
acquaintance
at
Bath
among
appal
old
gentleman
with
thin
leg
and
nankeen
trouser
,
and
be
of
high
standing
in
that
dreary
city
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
a
little
dreaded
elsewhere
in
consequence
of
an
indiscreet
profusion
in
the
article
of
rouge
and
persistency
in
an
obsolete
pearl
necklace
like
a
rosary
of
little
bird'

<EOS>
in
any
country
in
a
wholesome
state

Volumnia
would
be
a
clear
case

<EOS>
effort
have
be
make
to
get
her
on
it

and
when
William

it
be
fully

that
her
name
would
be
put
down
for
a
couple
of

<EOS>
but
William
Buffy
somehow
discover
,
contrary
to
all
expectation
,
that
these
be
not
the
time
when
it
could
be
do
,
and
this
be
the
first
clear
indication
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
have
convey
to
him
that
the
country

<EOS>
there

He
have
be

particularly
desirous

unaccompanied

somehow
William

find
when

come
in

he
could

this

second

they

in
purposeless

seem

not

hand
down

eloquent

pot

bore
my

who
,
after
a
languid
effort
to
listen
,
or
rather
a
languid
resignation
of
herself
to
a
show
of
listening
,
become
distraught
and
fall
into
a
contemplation
of
the
fire
as

her
fire
at
Chesney
Wold

she
have
never
leave
it

Sir

quite
unconscious

read
on
through
his

occasionally
stop

express
approval

as

very
properly

I
have
frequently

go
up

down
the

find
it
again

Esther

Narrative
 
Richard

be
go
away
some
time
when
a
visitor
come
to
pass
a
few
day
with
us

<EOS>
It
be
an
elderly
lady
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Mrs
Woodcourt

who
,
have
come
from
Wales
to
stay
with
Mrs
Bayham
Badger
and
have
write
to
my
guardian
,
"
by
her
son
Allan
's
desire
,
"
to
report
that
she
have
hear
from
him
and
that
he
be
well
"
and
send
his
kind
remembrance
to
all
of
us
,
"
have
be
invite
by
my
guardian
to
make
a
visit
to
Bleak
House
.
 
<EOS>
She
stay
with
us
nearly
three
week
.
 
<EOS>
She
take
very
kindly
to
me
and
be
extremely
confidential
,
so
much
so
that
sometimes
she
almost
make
me
uncomfortable
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
right
<EOS>
,
I
know
very
well
,
to
be
uncomfortable
because
she
confide
in
me
,
and
I
feel
it
be
unreasonable
;
still
,
with
all
I
could
do
,
I
could
not
quite
help
it
.
   
<EOS>
She
be
such
a
sharp
little
lady
and
use
to
sit
with
her
hand
fold
in
each
other
look
so
very
watchful
while
she
talk
to
me
that
perhaps
I
find
that
rather
irksome
.
 
<EOS>
or
perhaps
it
be
her
be
so
upright
and
trim
,
though
I
do
not
think
it
be
that
,
because
I
think
that
quaintly
pleasant
.
 
<EOS>
nor
can
it
have
be
the
general
expression
of
her
face
,
which
be
very
sparkling
and
pretty
for
an
old
lady
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
or
at
least
if
I
do
now
,
I
think
I
do
not
then
.
 
<EOS>
or
at
least
---
but
it
do
not
matter
.
   
<EOS>
of
a
night
when
I
be
go
upstairs
to
bed
,
she
would
invite
me
into
her
room
,
where
she
sit
before
the
fire
in
a
great
chair
;
and
,
dear
me
,
she
would
tell
me
about
Morgan
ap
-
Kerrig
until
I
be
quite
low
-
spirited
!
 
<EOS>
sometimes
she
recite
a
few
verse
from
Crumlinwallinwer
and
the
Mewlinn
-
willinwodd
(
if
those
be
the
right
name
,
which
I
dare
say
they
be
not
)
,
and
would
become
quite
fiery
with
the
sentiment
they
express
.
 
<EOS>
though
I
never
know
what
they
be
(
be
in
Welsh
)
,
further
than
that
they
be
highly
eulogistic
of
the
lineage
of
Morgan
ap
-
Kerrig
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
,
Miss
Summerson
,
"
she
would
say
to
me
with
stately
triumph
,
"
<EOS>
this
,
you
see
,
be
the
fortune
inherit
by
my
son
.
 
<EOS>
wherever
my
son
go
,
he
can
claim
kindre
with
Ap
-
Kerrig
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
not
have
money
,
but
he
always
have
what
be
much
well
---
family
,
my
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
have
my
doubt
of
their
care
so
very
much
for
Morgan
ap
-
Kerrig
in
India
and
China
,
but
of
course
I
never
express
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
use
to
say
it
be
a
great
thing
to
be
so
highly
connected
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
,
my
dear
,
a
great
thing
,
"
Mrs
Woodcourt
would
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
have
its
disadvantage
;
my
son
's
choice
of
a
wife
,
for
instance
,
be
limit
by
it
,
but
the
matrimonial
choice
of
the
royal
family
be
limit
in
much
the
same
manner
.
"
   
<EOS>
then
she
would
pat
me
on
the
arm
and
smooth
my
dress
,
as
much
as
to
assure
me
that
she
have
a
good
opinion
of
me
,
the
distance
between
us
notwithstanding
.
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
Mr
Woodcourt
,
my
dear
,
"
she
would
say
,
and
always
with
some
emotion
,
for
with
her
lofty
pedigree
<EOS>
she
have
a
very
affectionate
heart
,
"
be
descend
from
a
great
Highland
family

the
MacCoorts
of
MacCoort

<EOS>
He
serve
his
king
and

as
an
officer

Highlanders

he
die
on
the
field

<EOS>
My

be
one
of
the
last
representative
of
two
old
family
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
blessing
of
heaven
he
will
set
them
up
again
and
unite
them
with
another
old
family

"
   
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
for
me
to
try
to
change
the
subject
,
as
I
use
to
try
,
only
for
the
sake
of
novelty
or
perhaps
because
<EOS>
---
but
I
need
not
be
so
particular

<EOS>
Mrs

never
would
let
me
change
it

<EOS>
"

oh
,
Mrs
Woodcourt

I

so
difficult

<EOS>
"
why
be
it
so
difficult
,
my

<EOS>
"
I
do
not

it
myself

"
to
give
an
opinion

"
on
so
slight
an
acquaintance

my
dear

<EOS>
that
be
true
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
that
,
because
Mr
Woodcourt
have
be
at
our
house
a
good
deal
altogether
and
have
become
quite
intimate
with
my
guardian
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
so
,
and
add
that
he
seem
to
be
very
clever
in
his
profession
---
we
think
---
and
that
his
kindness
and
gentleness
to
Miss
Flite
be
above
all
praise
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
him
justice
!
"
say
Mrs
Woodcourt
,
press
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
define
him
exactly
.
 
<EOS>
Allan
be
a
dear
fellow

in
his
profession
faultless

<EOS>
I
say
it
,
though
I
be
his
mother

<EOS>
still

I
must
confess
he
be
not

fault

<EOS>
"
none
of

be

I.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
but
his
really
be
fault
that
he
may
correct
,
and
ought
to
correct

"
return
the
sharp
old
lady
,
sharply
shake
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
much
attach
to
you
that
I
may
confide
in
you

my
dear

as
a
third
party
wholly
disintereste
,
that
he
be
fickleness
itself

"
   
<EOS>
I
say
I
should
have
think
it
hardly
possible
that
he
could
have
be
otherwise
than
constant
to
his
profession
and
zealous
in
the
pursuit
of
it
,
judge
from
the
reputation
he
have
earn
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
right
again
,
my
dear
,
"
the
old
lady
retort
,
"
but
I
do
not
refer
to
his
profession
,
look
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
no

"
say
she

<EOS>
"
I
refer
,
my

to
his
social
conduct

<EOS>
He
be
always
pay
trivial
attention
to
young
lady
,
and
always
have
be
,
ever
since
he
be
eighteen
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
my
dear
,
he
have
never
really
care
for
any
one
of
them
and
have
never
mean
in
do
this
to
do
any
harm

to
express
anything

politeness

good
nature

still

it

you

it

"
no

it

lead
to
mistaken
notion

you
see

my

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
may
.
   
<EOS>
"
therefore
,
I
have
tell
him
many
time
that
he
really
should
be
more
careful
,
both
in
justice
to
himself
and
in
justice
to
other

<EOS>
and
he
have
always
say
,
"
Mother

I
will
be

you

better

nothing

<EOS>
all
of
which
be
very
true

my

be
no

<EOS>
however

so
far
away

for
an
indefinite

five

you

so
neat

<EOS>
and
nobody
,
my

will
congratulate
you
more
sincerely
on
such
a
marriage
than
I
shall
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
curious
that
this
should
make
me
uncomfortable
,
but
I
think
it
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
make
me
for
some
part
of
that
night
uncomfortable
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
ashamed
of
my
folly
that
I
do
not
like
to
confess
it
even
to
Ada
,
and
that
make
me
more
uncomfortable
still
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
give
anything
not
to
have
be
so
much
in
the
bright
old
lady
's
confidence
if
I
could
have
possibly
decline
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
give
me
the
most
inconsistent
opinion
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
at
one
time
I
think
she
be
a
story
-
teller
,
and
at
another
time
that
she
be
the
pink
of
truth
.
 
<EOS>
now
I
suspect
that
she
be
very
cunning
,
<EOS>
next
moment
I
believe
her
honest
Welsh
heart
to
be
perfectly
innocent
and
simple
.
 
<EOS>
and
after
all
,
what
do
it
matter
to
me
,
and
why
do
it
matter
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
why
could
not
I
,
go
up
to
bed
with
my
basket
of
key
,
stop
to
sit
down
by
her
fire
and
accommodate
myself
for
a
little
while
to
her
,
at
least
as
well
as
to
anybody
else
,
and
not
trouble
myself
about
the
harmless
thing
she
say
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
impel
towards
her
,
as
I
certainly
be
,
for
I
be
very
anxious
that
she
should
like
me
and
be
very
glad
indeed
<EOS>
that
she
do
,
why
should
I
harp
afterwards
,
with
actual
distress
and
pain
,
on
every
word
she
say
and
weigh
it
over
and
over
again
in
twenty
scale
?
 
<EOS>
why
be
it
so
worrying
to
me
to
have
her
in
our
house
,
and
confidential
to
me
every
night
,
when
I
yet
feel
that
it
be
well
and
safe
somehow
that
she
should
be
there
than
anywhere
else
?
 
<EOS>
these
be
perplexity
and
contradiction
that
I
could
not
account
for
.
 
<EOS>
at
least
,
if
I
could
---
but
I
shall
come
to
all
that
by
and
by
,
and
it
be
mere
idleness
to
go
on
about
it
now
.
   
<EOS>
so
when
Mrs
Woodcourt
go
away
,
I
be
sorry
to
lose
her
but
be
relieve
too
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
Caddy
Jellyby
come
down
,
and
Caddy
bring
such
a
packet
of
domestic
news
that
it
give
us
abundant
occupation
.
   
<EOS>
First
Caddy
declare
(
and
would
at
first
declare
nothing
else
)
that
I
be
the
good
adviser
that
ever
be
know
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
my
pet
say
,
be
no
news
at
all
;
and
this
,
I
say
,
of
course
,
be
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
then
Caddy
tell
us
that
she
be
go
to
be
marry
in
a
month
and
that
if
Ada
and
I
would
be
her
bridesmaid
,
she
be
the
happy
girl
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
this
be
news
indeed
;
and
I
think
we
never
should
have
do
talk
about
it
,
we
have
so
much
to
say
to
Caddy
,
and
Caddy
have
so
much
to
say
to
us
.
   
<EOS>
It
seem
that
Caddy
's
unfortunate
papa
have
get
over
his
bankruptcy
---
"
go
through
the
Gazette
,
"
be
the
expression
Caddy
use
,
as
if
it
be
a
tunnel
---
with
the
general
clemency
and
commiseration
of
his
creditor
,
and
have
get
rid
of
his
affair
in
some
bless
manner
without
succeed
in
understand
them
,
and
have
give
up
everything
he
possess
(
which
be
not
worth
much
,
I
should
think
,
to
judge
from
the
state
of
the
furniture
)
,
and
have
satisfy
every
one
concern
that
he
could
do
no
more
,
poor
man
.
<EOS>
so
,
he
have
be
honourably
dismiss
to
"
the
office
"
to
begin
the
world
again
.
 
<EOS>
what
he
do
at
the
office
,
I
never
know
;
Caddy
say
he
be
a
"
custom
-
house
and
general
agent
,
"
and
the
only
thing
I
ever
understand
about
that
business
be
that
when
he
want
money
more
than
usual
he
go
to
the
dock
to
look
for
it
,
and
hardly
ever
find
it
.
   
<EOS>
as
soon
as
her
papa
have
tranquillize
his
mind
by
become
this
shorn
lamb
,
and
they
have
remove
to
a
furnished
lodging
in
Hatton
Garden
(
where
I
find
the
child
,
when
I
afterwards
go
there
,
cut
the
horse
hair
out
of
the
seat
of
the
chair
and
choke
themselves
with
it
)
,
Caddy
have
bring
about
a
meeting
between
him
and
old
Mr
Turveydrop
;
and
poor
Mr
Jellyby
,
be
very
humble
and
meek
,
have
defer
to
Mr
Turveydrop
's
deportment
so
submissively
that
they
have
become
excellent
friend
.
 
<EOS>
by
degree
,
old
Mr
Turveydrop
,
thus
familiarize
with
the
idea
of
his
son
's
marriage
,
have
work
up
his
parental
feeling
to
the
height
of
contemplate
that
event
as
be
near
at
hand
and
have
give
his
gracious
consent
to
the
young
couple
commence
housekeeping
at
the
academy
in
Newman
Street
when
they
would
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
your
papa
,
Caddy
.
 
<EOS>
what
do
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Poor
Pa
,
"
say
Caddy
,
"
only
cry
and
say
he
hope
we
may
get
on
better
than
he
and
Ma
have
get
on
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
say
so
before
Prince
,
he
only
say
so
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
say
,
"
My
poor
girl
,
you
have
not
be
very
well
teach
how
to
make
a
home
for
your
husband
,
but
unless
you
mean
with
all
your
heart
to
strive
to
do
it
,
you
bad
well
murder
him
than
marry
him
---
if
you
really
love
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
and
how
do
you
reassure
him
,
Caddy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
it
be
very
distressing
,
you
know
,
to
see
poor
Pa
so
low
and
hear
him
say
such
terrible
thing
,
and
I
could
not
help
cry
myself
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
tell
him
that
I
do
mean
it
with
all
my
heart
and
that
I
hope
our
house
would
be
a
place
for
him
to
come
and
find
some
comfort
in
of
an
evening
and
that
I
hope
and
think
I
could
be
a
well
daughter
to
him
there
than
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
mention
Peepy
be
come
to
stay
with
me
,
and
then
Pa
begin
to
cry
again
and
say
the
child
be
Indians
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indians
,
Caddy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Caddy
,
"
wild
Indians
.
 
<EOS>
and
Pa
say
"
<EOS>
---
here
she
begin
to
sob
,
poor
girl
,
not
at
all
like
the
happy
girl
in
the
world
---
 
"
that
he
be
sensible
the
good
thing
that
could
happen
to
them
be
their
be
all
tomahawk
together
.
"
   
<EOS>
Ada
suggest
that
it
be
comfortable
to
know
that
Mr
Jellyby
do
not
mean
these
destructive
sentiment
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
of
course
I
know
Pa
would
not
like
his
family
to
be
welter
in
their
blood
,
"
say
Caddy
,
"
but
<EOS>
he
mean
that
they
be
very
unfortunate
in
be
Ma
's
child
and
that
he
be
very
unfortunate
in
be
Ma
's
husband
;
and
I
be
sure
that
be
true
,
though
it
seem
unnatural
to
say
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
ask
Caddy
if
Mrs
Jellyby
know
that
her
wedding
-
day
be
fix
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
You
know
what
Ma
be
,
Esther
<EOS>
,
"
she
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
impossible
to
say
whether
she
know
it
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
tell
it
often
enough
;
and
when
she
be
tell
it
,
she
only
give
me
a
placid
look
,
as
if
I
be
I
do
not
know
what
---
a
steeple
in
the
distance
,
"
say
Caddy
with
a
sudden
idea
;
"
<EOS>
and
then
she
shake
her
head
and
say
"
oh
,
Caddy
,
Caddy
,
what
a
tease
you
be
!
"
and
go
on
with
the
Borrioboola
letter
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
and
about
your
wardrobe
,
Caddy
?
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
for
she
be
under
no
restraint
with
us
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
Esther
,
"
she
return
,
dry
her
eye
,
"
I
must
do
the
good
I
can
and
trust
to
my
dear
Prince
never
to
have
an
unkind
remembrance
of
my
come
so
shabbily
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
question
concern
an
outfit
for
Borrioboola
,
Ma
would
know
all
about
it
and
would
be
quite
excited
.
 
<EOS>
be
what
it
be
,
she
neither
know
nor
care
.
"
   
<EOS>
Caddy
be
not
at
all
deficient
in
natural
affection
for
her
mother
,
but
mention
this
with
tear
as
an
undeniable
fact
,
which
I
be
afraid
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
sorry
for
the
poor
dear
girl
and
find
so
much
to
admire
in
the
good
disposition
which
have
survive
under
such
discouragement
that
we
both
at
once
(
I
mean
Ada
and
I
)
propose
a
little
scheme
that
make
her
perfectly
joyful
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
her
stay
with
us
for
three
week
,
my
staying
with
her
for
one
,
and
our
all
three
contrive
and
cut
out
,
and
repair
,
and
sewing
,
and
saving
,
and
do
the
very
good
<EOS>
we
could
think
of
to
make
the
most
of
her
stock
.
 
<EOS>
My
guardian
be
as
pleased
with
the
idea
as
Caddy
be
,
we
take
her
home
next
day
to
arrange
the
matter
and
bring
her
out
again
in
triumph
with
her
box
and
all
the
purchase
that
could
be
squeeze
out
of
a
ten
-
pound
note
,
which
Mr
Jellyby
have
find
in
the
dock
I
suppose
,
but
which
he
at
all
event
give
her
.
 
<EOS>
what
my
guardian
would
not
have
give
her
if
we
have
encourage
him
,
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
,
but
we
think
it
right
to
compound
for
no
more
than
her
wedding
-
dress
and
bonnet
.
<EOS>
He
agree
to
this
compromise
,
and
if
Caddy
have
ever
be
happy
in
her
life
,
she
be
happy
when
we
sit
down
to
work
.
   
<EOS>
She
be
clumsy
enough
with
her
needle
,
poor
girl
,
and
prick
her
finger
as
much
as
she
have
be
use
to
ink
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
help
redden
a
little
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
partly
with
the
smart
and
partly
with
vexation
at
be
able
to
do
no
better
,
<EOS>
but
she
soon
get
over
that
and
begin
to
improve
rapidly
.
 
<EOS>
so
day
after
day
she
,
and
my
darling
,
and
my
little
maid
Charley
,
and
a
milliner
out
of
the
town
,
and
I
,
sit
hard
at
work
,
as
pleasantly
as
possible
.
   
<EOS>
over
and
above
this
,
Caddy
be
very
anxious
"
to
learn
housekeeping
,
"
as
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
mercy
upon
us
!
 
<EOS>
the
idea
of
her
learn
housekeeping
of
a
person
of
my
vast
experience
be
such
a
joke
that
I
laugh
,
and
colour
up
,
and
fall
into
a
comical
confusion
when
she
propose
it
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
say
,
"
Caddy
,
I
be
sure
you
be
very
welcome
to
learn
anything
that
you
can
learn
of
me
,
my
dear
,
"
and
I
show
her
all
my
book
and
method
and
all
my
fidgety
way
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
have
suppose
that
I
be
show
her
some
wonderful
invention
,
by
her
study
of
them
;
and
if
you
have
see
her
,
whenever
I
jingle
my
housekeeping
key
,
get
up
and
attend
me
,
certainly
you
may
have
think
that
there
never
be
a
great
imposter
than
I
with
a
blinder
follower
than
Caddy
Jellyby
.
   
<EOS>
so
what
with
working
and
housekeeping
,
and
lesson
to
Charley
,
and
backgammon
in
the
evening
with
my
guardian
,
and
duet
with
Ada
,
the
three
week
slip
fast
away
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
go
home
with
Caddy
to
see
what
could
be
do
there
,
and
Ada
and
Charley
remain
behind
to
take
care
of
my
guardian
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
say
I
go
home
with
Caddy
,
I
mean
to
the
furnished
lodging
in
Hatton
Garden
.
 
<EOS>
We
go
to
Newman
Street
two
or
three
time
,
where
preparation
be
in
progress
too
---
a
good
many
,
I
observe
,
for
enhance
the
comfort
of
old
Mr
Turveydrop
,
and
a
few
for
put
the
newly
marry
couple
away
cheaply
at
the
top
of
the
house
---
but
our
great
point
be
to
make
the
furnished
lodging
decent
for
the
wedding
-
breakfast
and
to
imbue
Mrs
Jellyby
beforehand
with
some
faint
sense
of
the
occasion
.
   
<EOS>
the
latter
be
the
more
difficult
thing
of
the
two
because
Mrs
Jellyby
and
an
unwholesome
boy
occupy
the
front
sit
-
room
(
the
back
one
be
a
mere
closet
)
,
and
it
be
litter
down
with
waste
-
paper
and
Borrioboolan
document
,
as
an
untidy
stable
may
be
litter
with
straw
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jellyby
sit
there
all
day
drink
strong
coffee
,
dictating
,
and
hold
Borrioboolan
interview
by
appointment
.
 
<EOS>
the
unwholesome
boy
,
who
seem
to
me
to
be
go
into
a
decline
,
take
his
meal
out
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
when
Mr
Jellyby
come
home
,
he
usually
groan
and
go
down
into
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
there
he
get
something
to
eat
if
the
servant
would
give
him
anything
,
and
then
,
feel
that
he
be
in
the
way
,
go
out
and
walk
about
Hatton
Garden
in
the
wet
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
child
scramble
up
and
tumble
down
the
house
as
they
have
always
be
accustomed
to
do
.
   
<EOS>
the
production
of
these
devoted
little
sacrifice
in
any
presentable
condition
be
quite
out
of
the
question
at
a
week
's
notice
,
I
propose
to
Caddy
that
we
should
make
them
as
happy
as
we
could
on
her
marriage
morning
in
the
attic
where
they
all
sleep
,
and
should
confine
our
great
effort
to
her
mama
and
her
mama
's
room
,
and
a
clean
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
in
truth
Mrs
Jellyby
require
a
good
deal
of
attention
,
the
lattice
-
work
up
her
back
have
widen
considerably
since
I
first
know
her
and
her
hair
look
like
the
mane
of
a
dustman
's
horse
.
   
<EOS>
think
that
the
display
of
Caddy
's
wardrobe
would
be
the
good
mean
of
approach
the
subject
,
I
invite
Mrs
Jellyby
to
come
and
look
at
it
spread
out
on
Caddy
's
bed
in
the
evening
after
the
unwholesome
boy
be
go
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Miss
Summerson
,
"
say
she
,
rise
from
her
desk
with
her
usual
sweetness
of
temper
,
"
these
be
really
ridiculous
preparation
,
though
your
assist
them
be
a
proof
of
your
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
so
inexpressibly
absurd
to
me
in
the
idea
of
Caddy
be
marry
!
 
<EOS>
oh
,
Caddy
,
you
silly
,
silly
,
silly
puss
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
come
upstairs
with
us
notwithstanding
and
look
at
the
clothe
in
her
customary
far
-
off
manner
.
 
<EOS>
They
suggest
one
distinct
idea
to
her
,
for
she
say
with
her
placid
smile
,
and
shake
her
head
,
"
My
good
Miss
Summerson
,
at
half
the
cost
,
this
weak
child
may
have
be
equip
for
Africa
!
"
   
<EOS>
on
our
go
downstairs
again
,
Mrs
Jellyby
ask
me
whether
this
troublesome
business
be
really
to
take
place
next
Wednesday
.
 
<EOS>
and
on
my
replying
yes
,
she
say
,
"
Will
my
room
be
require
,
my
dear
Miss
Summerson
?
 
<EOS>
for
it
be
quite
impossible
that
I
can
put
my
paper
away
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
take
the
liberty
of
say
that
the
room
would
certainly
be
want
and
that
I
think
we
must
put
the
paper
away
somewhere
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
my
dear
Miss
Summerson
,
"
say
Mrs
Jellyby
,
"
<EOS>
you
know
best
,
I
dare
say
.
 
<EOS>
but
by
oblige
me
to
employ
a
boy
,
Caddy
have
embarrass
me
to
that
extent
,
overwhelmed
as
I
be
with
public
business
,
that
I
do
not
know
which
way
to
turn
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
a
Ramification
meeting
,
too
,
on
Wednesday
afternoon
,
and
the
inconvenience
be
very
serious
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
likely
to
occur
again
,
"
say
I
,
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Caddy
will
be
marry
but
once
,
probably
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
,
"
Mrs
Jellyby
reply
;
"
that
be
true
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
must
make
the
good
of
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
the
next
question
be
how
Mrs
Jellyby
should
be
dress
on
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
very
curious
to
see
her
look
on
serenely
from
her
writing
-
table
while
Caddy
and
I
discuss
it
,
occasionally
shake
her
head
at
us
with
a
half
-
reproachful
smile
like
a
superior
spirit
who
could
just
bear
with
our
trifling
.
   
<EOS>
the
state
in
which
her
dress
be
,
and
the
extraordinary
confusion
in
which
she
keep
them
,
add
not
a
little
to
our
difficulty
;
but
at
length
we
devise
something
not
very
unlike
what
a
common
-
place
mother
may
wear
on
such
an
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
the
abstract
manner
in
which
Mrs
Jellyby
would
deliver
herself
up
to
have
this
attire
try
on
by
the
dressmaker
,
and
the
sweetness
with
which
she
would
then
observe
to
me
<EOS>
how
sorry
she
be
that
I
have
not
turn
my
thought
to
Africa
,
be
consistent
with
the
rest
of
her
behaviour
.
   
<EOS>
the
lodging
be
rather
confine
as
to
space
,
but
I
fancy
that
if
Mrs
Jellyby
's
household
have
be
the
only
lodger
in
Saint
Paul
's
or
Saint
Peter
's
,
the
sole
advantage
they
would
have
find
in
the
size
of
the
building
would
have
be
its
afford
a
great
deal
of
room
to
be
dirty
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
that
nothing
belong
to
the
family
which
it
have
be
possible
to
break
be
unbroken
at
the
time
of
those
preparation
for
Caddy
's
marriage
,
that
nothing
which
it
have
be
possible
to
spoil
in
any
way
be
unspoilt
,
and
that
no
domestic
object
which
be
capable
of
collect
dirt
,
from
a
dear
child
's
knee
to
the
door
-
plate
,
be
without
as
much
dirt
as
could
well
accumulate
upon
it
.
   
<EOS>
Poor
Mr
Jellyby
,
who
very
seldom
speak
and
almost
always
sit
when
he
be
at
home
with
his
head
against
the
wall
,
become
interested
when
he
see
that
Caddy
and
I
be
attempt
to
establish
some
order
among
all
this
waste
and
ruin
and
take
off
his
coat
to
help
.
<EOS>
but
such
wonderful
thing
come
tumble
out
of
the
closet
when
they
be
open
---
bit
of
mouldy
pie
,
sour
bottle
,
Mrs
Jellyby
's
cap
,
letter
,
tea
,
fork
,
odd
boot
and
shoe
of
child
,
firewood
,
wafer
,
saucepan
-
lid
,
damp
sugar
in
odd
and
end
of
paper
bag
,
footstool
,
blacklead
brush
,
bread
,
Mrs
Jellyby
's
bonnet
,
book
with
butter

to
the
bind
,
gutter

put
out
by

turn
upside
down
in
broken

,
nutshell
,
head
and
tail
of
shrimp
,
dinner
-
mat
,
glove
,
coffee
-
ground
,
umbrella
---
that
he
look
frightened
,
and
leave
off
again
.
<EOS>
but
he
come
regularly
every
evening
and
sit
without
his
coat
,
with
his
head
against
the
wall
,
as
though
he
would
have
help
us
if
he
have
know
how
.
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
Pa
!
"
say
Caddy
to
me
on
the
night
before
the
great
day
,
when
we
really
have
get
thing
a
little
to
right
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
seem
unkind
to
leave
him
,
Esther
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
could
I
do
if
I
stay
!
 
<EOS>
since
I
first
know
you
,
I
have
tidy
and
tidy
over
and
over
again
,
but
it
be
useless
.
 
<EOS>
Ma
and
Africa
,
together
,
upset
the
whole
house
directly
.
<EOS>
We
never
have
a
servant
who
do
not
drink
.
 
<EOS>
Ma
's
ruinous
to
everything
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jellyby
could
not
hear
what
she
say
,
but
he
seem
very
low
indeed
and
shed
tear
,
I
think
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
heart
ache
for
him
;
that
it
do
!
"
<EOS>
sob
Caddy
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
help
think
to
-
night
,
Esther
,
how
dearly
I
hope
to
be
happy
with
Prince
,
and
how
dearly
Pa
hope
,
I
dare
say
,
to
be
happy
with
Ma
.
<EOS>
what
a
disappointed
life
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Caddy
!
"
say
Mr
Jellyby
,
look
slowly
round
from
the
wail
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
time
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
I
ever
hear
him
say
three
word
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
Pa
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Caddy
,
go
to
him
and
embrace
him
affectionately
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Caddy
,
"
say
Mr
Jellyby
.
 
<EOS>
"
never
have
---
"
   
"
not
Prince
,
Pa
?
"
<EOS>
falter
Caddy
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
have
Prince
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Mr
Jellyby
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
him
,
certainly
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
never
have
---
"
   
<EOS>
I
mention
in
my
account
of
our
first
visit
in
Thavies
Inn
that
Richard
describe
Mr
Jellyby
as
frequently
open
his
mouth
after
dinner
without
say
anything
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
habit
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
He
open
his
mouth
now
a
great
many
time
and
shake
his
head
in
a
melancholy
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
wish
me
not
to
have
?
 
<EOS>
do
not
have
what
,
dear
Pa
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Caddy
,
coax
him
,
with
her
arm
round
his
neck
.
   
<EOS>
"
never
have
a
mission
,
my
dear
child
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jellyby
groan
and
lay
his
head
against
the
wall
again
,
and
this
be
the
only
time
I
ever
hear
him
make
any
approach
to
express
his
sentiment
on
the
Borrioboolan
question
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
have
be
more
talkative
and
lively
once
,
but
he
seem
to
have
be
completely
exhaust
long
before
I
know
him
.
   
<EOS>
I
think
Mrs
Jellyby
never
would
have
leave
off
serenely
look
over
her
paper
and
drinking
coffee
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
twelve
o'clock
before
we
could
obtain
possession
of
the
room
,
and
the
clearance
it
require
then
be
so
discouraging
that
Caddy
,
who
be
almost
tired
out
,
sit
down
in
the
middle
of
the
dust
and
cry
.
<EOS>
but
she
soon
cheer
up
,
and
we
do
wonder
with
it
before
we
go
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
morning
it
look
,
by
the
aid
of
a
few
flower
and
a
quantity
of
soap
and
water
and
a
little
arrangement
,
quite
gay
.
<EOS>
the
plain
breakfast
make
a
cheerful
show
,
and
Caddy
be
perfectly
charming
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
my
darling
come
,
I
think
---
<EOS>
and
I
think
now
---
 
that
I
never
have
see
such
a
dear
face
as
my
beautiful
pet
's
.
   
<EOS>
We
make
a
little
feast
for
the
child
upstairs
,
and
we
put
Peepy
at
the
head
of
the
table
,
and
we
show
them
Caddy
in
her
bridal
dress
,
and
they
clap
their
hand
and
hurrah
,
and
Caddy
cry
to
think
that
she
be
go
away
from
them
and
hug
them
over
and
over
again
until
we
bring
Prince
up
to
fetch
her
away
---
<EOS>
when
,
I
be
sorry
to
say
,
Peepy
bite
him
.
 
<EOS>
then
there
be
old
<EOS>
Mr
Turveydrop
downstairs
,
in

Mr

<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Pardiggle
be
of
the
party
---
Mr
Pardiggle
,
an
obstinate
-
looking
man
with
a
large
waistcoat
and
stubbly
hair
,
who
be
always
talk
in
a
loud
bass
voice
about
his
mite
,
or
Mrs
Pardiggle
's
mite
,
or
their
five
boy
'
mite
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Quale
,
with
his
hair
brush
back
as
usual
and
his
knob
of
temple
shine
very
much
,
be
also
there
,
not
in
the
character
of
a
disappointed
lover
,
but
as
the
accept
of
a
young
---
at
least
,
an
unmarried

lady
,
a
Miss
Wisk
,
who
be
also
there
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Wisk
's
mission
,
my
guardian
say
,
be
to
show
the
world
that
woman
's
mission
be
man
's
mission
and
that
the
only
genuine
mission
of
both
man
and
woman
be
to
be
always
move
declaratory
resolution
about
thing
in
general
at
public
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
the
guest
be
few
,
but
be
,
as
one
may
expect
at
Mrs
Jellyby
's
,
all
devote
to
public
object
only
.
<EOS>
besides
those
I
have
mention
,
there
be
an
extremely
dirty
lady
with
her
bonnet
all
awry
and
the
ticketed
price
of
her
dress
still
stick
on
it
,
<EOS>
whose
neglect
home
,
Caddy
tell
me
,
be
like
a
filthy
wilderness
,
but
whose
church
be
like
a
fancy
fair
.
 
<EOS>
a
very
contentious
gentleman
,
who
say
it
be
his
mission
to
be
everybody
's
brother
but
who
appear
to
be
on
term
of
coolness
with
the
whole
of
his
large
family
,
complete
the
party
.
   
<EOS>
a
party
,
have
less
in
common
with
such
an
occasion
,
could
hardly
have
be
get
together
by
any
ingenuity
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
mean
mission
as
the
domestic
mission
be
the
very
last
thing
to
be
endure
among
them
;
indeed
,
Miss
Wisk
inform
us
,
with
great
indignation
,
before
we
sit
down
to
breakfast
,
that
the
idea
of
woman
's
mission
lie
chiefly
in
the
narrow
sphere
of
home
be
an
outrageous
slander
on
the
part
of
her
tyrant
,
man
.
 
<EOS>
one
other
singularity
be
that
nobody
with
a
mission
---
except
Mr
Quale
,
whose
mission
,
as
I
think
I
have
formerly
say
,
be
to
be
in
ecstasy
with
everybody
's
mission
---
 
care
at
all
for
anybody
's
mission
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Pardiggle
be
as
clear
that
the
only
one
infallible
course
be
her
course
of
pounce
upon
the
poor
and
apply
benevolence
to
them
like
a
strait
-
waistcoat
;
as
Miss
Wisk
be
that
the
only
practical
thing
for
the
world
be
the
emancipation
of
woman
from
the
thraldom
of
her
tyrant
,
man
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Jellyby
,
all
the
while
,
sit
smile
at
the
limited
vision
that
could
see
anything
but
Borrioboola
-
Gha
.
   
<EOS>
but
I
be
anticipate
now
the
purport
of
our
conversation
on
the
ride
home
instead
of
first
marry
Caddy
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
go
to
church
,
and
Mr
Jellyby
give
her
away
.
 
<EOS>
of
the
air
with
which
<EOS>
old
Mr
Turveydrop
,
with
his
hat
under
his
left
arm
(
the
inside
present
at
the
clergyman
like
a
cannon
)
and
his
eye
crease
themselves
up
into
his
wig
,
stand
stiff
and
high
-
shouldered
behind
us
bridesmaid
during
the
ceremony
,
and
afterwards
salute
us
,
I
could
never
say
enough
to
do
it
justice
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Wisk
,
whom
I
can
not
report
as
prepossess
in
appearance
,
and
whose
manner
be
grim
,
listen
to
the
proceeding
,
as
part
of
woman
's
wrong
,
with
a
disdainful
face
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Jellyby
,
with
her
calm
smile
and
her
bright
eye
,
look
the
least
concerned
of
all
the
company
.
   
<EOS>
We
duly
come
back
to
breakfast
,
and
Mrs
Jellyby
sit
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
Mr
Jellyby
at
the
foot
.
 
<EOS>
Caddy
have
previously
steal
upstairs
to
hug
the
child
again
and
tell
them
that
her
name
be
Turveydrop
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
piece
of
information
,
instead
of
be
an
agreeable
surprise
to
Peepy
,
throw
him
on
his
back
in
such
transport
of
kick
grief
that
I
could
do
nothing
on
be
send
for
but
accede
to
the
proposal
that
he
should
be
admit
to
the
breakfast
table
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
come
down
and
sit
in
my
lap
;
and
Mrs
Jellyby
,
after
say
,
in
reference
to
the
state
of
his
pinafore
,
"
oh
,
you
naughty
Peepy
,
what
a
shocking
little
pig
you
be
!
"
<EOS>
be
not
at
all
discompose
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
good
except
that
he
bring
down
Noah
with
him
(
out
of
an
ark
I
have
give
him
before
we
go
to
church
)
and
WOULD
dip
him
head
first
into
the
wine
-
glass
and
then
put
him
in
his
mouth
.
   
<EOS>
My
guardian
,
with
his
sweet
temper
and
his
quick
perception
and
his
amiable
face
,
make
something
agreeable
even
out
of
the
ungenial
company
.
 
<EOS>
none
of
them
seem
able
to
talk
about
anything
but
his
,
or
her
,
own
one
subject
,
and
none
of
them
seem
able
to
talk
about
even
that
as
part
of
a
world
in
which
there
be
anything
else
;
but
my
guardian
turn
it
all
to
the
merry
encouragement
of
Caddy
and
the
honour
of
the
occasion
,
and
bring
us
through
the
breakfast
nobly
.
 
<EOS>
what
we
should
have
do
without
him
,
I
be
afraid
to
think
,
for
all
the
company
despise
the
bride
and
bridegroom
and
old
Mr
Turveydrop
---
and
old
Mr
Thrveydrop
,
in
virtue
of
his
deportment
,
consider
himself
vastly
superior
to
all
the
company
---
it
be
a
very
unpromising
case
.
   
<EOS>
at
last
the
time
come
when
poor
Caddy
be
to
go
and
when
all
her
property
be
pack
on
the
hire
coach
and
pair
that
be
to
take
her
and
her
husband
to
Gravesend

<EOS>
It
affect
us
to
see
Caddy
cling
,
then
,
to
her
deplorable
home
and
hang
on
her
mother
's
neck
with
the
great
tenderness
.
   
<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
"
You
be

take

Mrs

positively

<EOS>
then
Caddy
hang
upon
her
father

nurse
his

against
hers
as

I

and
then

They

Ada

He

I

They

<EOS>
Nurse
and
Patient
 
I
have
not
be
at
home
again
many
day
when
one
evening
I
go
upstairs
into
my
own
room
to
take
a
peep
over
Charley
's
shoulder
and
see
how
she
be
get
on
with
her
copy
-
book
.
 
<EOS>
Writing
be
a
try
business
to
Charley
,
who
seem
to
have
no
natural
power
over
a
pen
,
but
in
whose
hand
every
pen
appear
to
become
perversely
animate
,
and
to
go
wrong
and
crooked
,
and
to
stop
,
and
splash
,
and
sidle
into
corner
like
a
saddle
-
donkey
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
odd
to
see
what
old
letter
Charley
's
young
hand
have
make
,
they
so
wrinkle
,
and
shrivel
,
and
totter
,
it
so
plump
and
round
.
<EOS>
yet
Charley
be
uncommonly
expert
at
other
thing
and
have
as
nimble
little
finger
as
I
ever
watch
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
Charley
,
"
say
I
,
look
over
a
copy
of
the
letter
o
in
which
it
be
represent
as
square
,
triangular
,
pear
-
shape
,
and
collapse
in
all
kind
of
way
,
"
we
be
improve
.
 
<EOS>
if
we
only
get
to
make
it
round
,
we
shall
be
perfect
,
Charley
.
"
   
<EOS>
then
I
make
one
,
and
Charley
make
one
,
and
the
pen
would
not
join
Charley
's
neatly
,
but
twist
it
up
into
a
knot

<EOS>
the
alacrity
with
which
Charley
bring
my
bonnet

veil
,
and
have
dress
me
,
quaintly
pin
herself
into
her
warm
shawl

make
herself
look
like
a
little
old
woman
,
sufficiently
express
her
readiness

<EOS>
so
Charley

I
,
without

anything

go
out

It
be

cold

wild
night

and
the
tree
shudder
in
the
wind

<EOS>
the
rain
have
be
thick
and
heavy
all
day
,
and
with
little
intermission
for
many
day
.
 
<EOS>
none
be
fall
just
then
,
however
.
<EOS>
the
sky
have
partly
clear
,
but
be
very
gloomy
---
even
above
us
,
where
a
few
star
be
shine
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
north
and
north
-
west
,
where
the
sun
have
set
three
hour
before
,
there
be
a
pale
dead
light
both
beautiful
and
awful
;
and
into
it
long
sullen
line
of
cloud
wave
up
like
a
sea
stricken
immovable
as
it
be
heave
.
 
<EOS>
towards
London
a
lurid
glare
overhang
the
whole
dark
waste
,
and
the
contrast
between
these
two
light
,
and
the
fancy
which
the
red
light
engender
of
an
unearthly
fire
,
gleam
on
all
the
unseen
building
of
the
city
and
on
all
the
face
of
its
many
thousand
of
wonder
inhabitant
,
be
as
solemn
as
may
be
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
no
thought
that
night
---
<EOS>
none
,
I
be
quite
sure
---
of
what
be
soon
to
happen
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
always
remember
since
that
when
we
have
stop
at
the
garden
-
gate
to
look
up
at
the
sky
,
and
when
we
go
upon
our
way
,
I
have
for
a
moment
an
undefinable
impression
of
myself
as
be
something
different
from
what
I
then
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
be
then
<EOS>
and
there
that
I
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
ever
since
connect
the
feeling
with
that
spot
and
time
and
with
everything
associate
with
that
spot
and
time
,
to
the
distant
voice
in
the
town
,
the
barking
of
a
dog
,
and
the
sound
of
wheel
come
down
the
miry
hill
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
Saturday
night
,
and
most
of
the
people
belong
to
the
place
where
we
be
go
be
drink
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
We
find
it
quieter
than
I
have
previously
see
it
,
though
quite
as
miserable
.
<EOS>
the
kiln
be
burn
,
and
a
stifle
vapour
set
towards
us
with
a
pale
-
blue
glare
.
   
<EOS>
We
come
to
the
cottage
,
where
there
be
a
feeble
candle
in
the
patch
window
.
 
<EOS>
We
tap
at
the
door
and
go
in

<EOS>
the
mother

little

He

warm
himself

the
crazy
door
and
window
shake

the
place

unhealthy

very
peculiar

up
instantly
and
stare
at
me
with
a
remarkable
expression
of
surprise
and
terror

<EOS>
His
action
be
so
quick
and
my
be
the
cause
of
it

so
evident

nearer

there
she
be
,
do
all
this
in
a
quiet
motherly
manner
as
if
she
be
live
in
Mrs
Blinder
's
attic
with
Tom
and
Emma
again
.
   
<EOS>
the
friend
have
be
here
and
there
,
and
have
be
play
about
from
hand
to
hand
,
and
have
come
back
as
she
go
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
it
be
too
early
for
the
boy
to
be
receive
into
the
proper
refuge
,
and
at
last
it
be
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
one
official
send
her
to
another
,
and
the
other
send
her
back
again
to
the
first
,
and
so
backward
and
forward
,
until
it
appear
to
me
as
if
both
must
have
be
appoint
for
their
skill
in
evade
their
duty
instead
of
perform
them
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
,
after
all
,
she
say
,
breathe
quickly
,
for
she
have
be
run
and
be
frightened
too
,
<EOS>
"
Jenny
,
your
master
be
on
the
road
home
,
and
mine
be
not
far
behind
,
and
the
Lord
help
the
boy
,
for
we
can
do
no
more
for
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
They
put
a
few
halfpence
together
and
hurry
them
into
his
hand
,
and
so
,
in
an
oblivious
,
half
-
thankful
,
half
-
insensible
way
,
he
shuffle
out
of
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
"
give
me
the
child
,
my
dear
,
"
say
its
mother
to
Charley
,
"
and
thank
you
kindly
too
!
 
<EOS>
Jenny
,
woman
dear
,
good
night
!
   
<EOS>
young
lady
,
if
my
master
do
not
fall
out
with
me
,
I
will
look
down
by
the
kiln
by
and
by
,
where
the
boy
will
be
most
like
,
and
again
in
the
morning
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
hurry
off
,
and
presenfty
<EOS>
we
pass
her
hushing
and
singe
to
her
child
at
her
own
door
and
look
anxiously
along
the
road
for
her
drunken
husband
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
of
stay
then
to
speak
to
either
woman
,
lest
I
should
bring
her
into
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
say
to
Charley
that
we
must
not
leave
the
boy
to
die
.
 
<EOS>
Charley
,
who
know
what
to
do
much
well
than
I
do
,
and
whose
quickness
equal
her
presence
of
mind
,
glide
on
before
me
,
and
presently
we
come
up
with
Jo
,
just
short
of
the
brick
-
kiln
.
   
<EOS>
I
think
he
must
have
begin
his
journey
with
some
small
bundle
under
his
arm
and
must
have
have
it
steal
or
lose
it
.
 
<EOS>
for
he
still
carry
his
wretched
fragment
of
fur
cap
like
a
bundle
,
though
he
go
bareheade
through
the
rain
,
which
now
fall
fast
.
 
<EOS>
He
stop
when
we
call
to
him
and
again
show
a
dread
of
me
when
I
come
up
,
stand
with
his
lustrous
eye
fix
upon
me
,
and
even
arrest
in
his
shivering
fit
.
   
<EOS>
I
ask
him
to
come
with
us
,
and
we
would
take
care
that
he
have
some
shelter
for
the
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
no
shelter
,
"
he
say
;
"
I
can
lay
amongst
the
warm
brick
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
but
do
not
you
know
that
people
die
there
?
"
reply
Charley
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
die
everywhere
,
"
say
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
die
in
their
lodging
---
she
know
where
;
I
show
her
---
and
they
die
down
in
Tom
-
all
-
Alone
be
in
heap
.
 
<EOS>
They
die
more
than
they
live
,
accord
to
what
I
see
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
he
hoarsely
whisper
Charley
,
"
if
she
be
not
the
t'other
one
,
she
be
not
the
forrenner
.
 
<EOS>
be
there
three
of
'em
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
Charley
look
at
me
a
little
frightened
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
half
frightened
at
myself
when
the
boy
glare
on
me
so
.
   
<EOS>
but
he
turn
and
follow
when
I
beckon
to
him
,
and
find
that
he
acknowledge
that
influence
in
me
,
I
lead
the
way
straight
home
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
far
,
only
at
the
summit
of
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
We
pass
but
one
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
if
we
should
have
get
home
without
assistance
,
the
boy
's
step
be
so
uncertain
and
tremulous
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
no
complaint
,
however
,
and
be
strangely
unconcerned
about
himself
,
if
I
may
say
so
strange
a
thing
.
   
<EOS>
leave
him
in
the
hall
for
a
moment
,
shrink
into
the
corner
of
the
window
-
seat
and
stare
with
an
indifference
that
scarcely
could
be
call
wonder
at
the
comfort
and
brightness
about
him
<EOS>
,
I
go
into
the
drawing
-
room
to
speak
to
my
guardian
.
 
<EOS>
there
I
find
Mr
Skimpole
,
who
have
come
down
by
the
coach
,
as
he
frequently
do
without
notice
,
and
never
bring
any
clothe
with
him
,
but
always
borrow
everything
he
want
.
   
<EOS>
They
come
out
with
me
directly
to
look
at
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
the
servant
have
gather
in
the
hall
too
,
and
he
shiver
in
the
window
-
seat
with
Charley
stand
by
him
,
like
some
wound
animal
that
have
be
find
in
a
ditch
.
   
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
sorrowful
case
,
"
say
my
guardian
after
ask
him
a
question
or
two
and
touch
him
and
examine
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
say
,
Harold
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
turn
him
out
,
"
say
Mr
Skimpole
.
   
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
inquire
my
guardian
,
almost
sternly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Jarndyce
,
"
say
Mr
Skimpole
,
"
you
know
what
I
be
:
I
be
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
be
cross
to
me
if
I
deserve
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
a
constitutional
objection
to
this
sort
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
have
,
when
I
be
a
medical
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
safe
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
very
bad
sort
of
fever
about
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Skimpole
have
retreat
from
the
hall
to
the
drawing
-
room
again
and
say
this
in
his
airy
way
,
seat
on
the
music
-
stool
as
we
stand
by
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
say
it
be
childish
,
"
observe
Mr
Skimpole
,
look
gaily
at
us
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
dare
say
it
may
be
;
but
I
am
a
child
,
and
I
never
pretend
to
be
anything
else
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
put
him
out
in
the
road
,
you
only
put
him
where
he
be
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
be
no
bad
off
than
he
be
,
you
know

<EOS>
even
make
him
well
off
,
if
you
like

<EOS>
give
him
sixpence
,
or
five
shilling
,
or
five
pound
ten
---
you
be
arithmetician
,

I
be
not

and
get
rid
of
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
what
be
he
to
do
then
?
"
ask
my
guardian
.
   
<EOS>
"
upon
my
life
,
"
say
Mr
Skimpole
,
shrug
his
shoulder
with
his
engage
smile
,
"
I
have
not
the
least
idea
what
he
be
to
do
then
.

but
I
have
no
doubt
he
will
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
be
it
not
a
horrible
reflection
,
"
say
my
guardian
,
to
whom
I
have
hastily
explain
the
unavaile
effort
of
the
two
woman
,
"
be
it
not
a
horrible
reflection
,
"
walk
up
and
down
and
rumple
his
hair
,
"
that
if
this
wretched
creature
be
a
convict
prisoner
,
his
hospital
would
be
wide
open
to
him
,
and
he
would
be
as
well
take
care
of
as
any
sick
boy
in
the
kingdom

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Jarndyce
,
"
return
Mr
Skimpole
,
"
you
will
pardon
the
simplicity
of
the
question
,
come
as
it
do
from
a
creature
who
be
perfectly
simple
in
worldly
matter
,
but
why
ISN'T
he
a
prisoner
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
My
guardian
stop
and
look
at
him
with
a
whimsical
mixture
of
amusement
and
indignation
in
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Our
young
friend
be
not
to
be
suspect
of
any
delicacy
,
I
should
imagine
,
"
say
Mr
Skimpole
,
unabashed
and
candid
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
seem
to
me
that
it
would
be
wise
,
as
well
as
in
a
certain
kind
of
way
more
respectable
,
if
he
show
some
misdirect
energy
that
get
him
into
prison
.
 
<EOS>
there
would
be
more
of
an
adventurous
spirit
in
it
,
and
consequently
more
of
a
certain
sort
of
poetry
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
"
return
my
guardian
,
resume
his
uneasy
walk
,
"
that
there
be
not
such
another
child
on
earth
as
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
really
?
"
say
Mr
Skimpole
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
confess
I
do
not
see
why
our
young
friend
,
in
his
degree
,
should
not
seek
to
invest
himself
with
such
poetry
as
be
open
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
no
doubt
bear
with
an
appetite
---
<EOS>
probably
,
when
he
be
in
a
safe
state
of
health
,
he
have
an
excellent
appetite
.
 
<EOS>
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
at
our
young
friend
's
natural
dinner
hour
,
most
likely
about
noon
,
our
young
friend
say
in
effect
to
society
,
"
I
be
hungry
;
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
produce
your
spoon
and
feed
me

Society
,
which
have
take
upon
itself
the
general
arrangement
of
the
whole
system
of
spoon
and
professe
to
have
a
spoon
for
our
young
friend
,
do
not
produce
that
spoon
;
and
our
young
friend
,
therefore
,
say
"
You
really
must
excuse
me
if
I
seize
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
now
,
this
appear
to
me
a
case
of
misdirected
energy
,
which
have
a
certain
amount
of
reason
in
it
and
a
certain
amount
of
romance
;
and
I
do
not
know
but
what
I
should
be
more
interested
in
our
young
friend
,
as
an
illustration
of
such
a
case
,
than
merely
as
a
poor
vagabond
---
which
any
one
can
be

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
in
the

I
venture
to

get
bad

<EOS>
"
in

say
Mr

cheerfully

as
Miss
Summerson

with
her
practical
good
sense
,
observe
,

bad

therefore
I
recommend
your
turn
him
out
before
he
get
still
bad

"
   
<EOS>
the
amiable
face
with
which
he
say
it
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
shall
never
forget
.
   
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
little

observe
my

tume
to
me
,
<EOS>
"
I
can
ensure
his
admission
into
the
proper
place
by
merely
go
there
to
enforce
it

though
it
be
a
bad
state
of
thing
when
,
in
his

that
be
necessary

<EOS>
but
it
be
grow
late
,
and
be
a
very
bad
night
,
and
the
boy
be
wear
out
already

<EOS>
there
be
a
bed
in
the
wholesome
loft
-
room
by
the
stable

we
have
better
keep
him
there
till
morning
,
when
he
can
be
wrap
up

remove

We
will
do
that

"
oh

Mr
Skimpole
,
with
his
hand
upon
the
key
of
the

away

how
I

you
your

Mr

with
playful
admiration

You

You

anything

"
say
my
guardian
,
look
back
over
his
shoulder
half
angrily
;
only
half
angrily
,
for
he
never
seem
to
consider
Mr

an
accountable
being

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Jarndyce
,
I
observe
a
bottle
of
cool
medicine
in
his
pocket
,
and
it
be
impossible
for
him
to
do
better
than
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
tell
them
to
sprinkle
a
little
vinegar
about
the
place
where
he
sleep
and
to
keep
it
moderately
cool
and
him
moderately
warm
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
mere
impertinence
in
me
to
offer
any
recommendation
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Summerson
have
such
a
knowledge
of
detail
and
such
a
capacity
for
the
administration
of
detail
that
she
know
all
about
it

"
   
<EOS>
We
go
back
into
the
hall
and
explain
to
Jo
what
we
propose
to
do
,
which
Charley
explain
to
him
again
and
which
he
receive
with
the
languid
unconcern
I
have
already
notice
,
wearily
look
on
at
what
be
do
as
if
it
be
for
somebody
else

<EOS>
the
servant
compassionate
his
miserable
state
and
be
very
anxious
to
help

we
soon
get
the
loft
-
room
ready
;
and
some
of
the
man
about
the
house
carry
him
across
the
wet
yard
,
well
wrap
up
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
pleasant
to
observe
how
kind
they
be
to
him
and
how
there
appear
to
be
a
general
impression
among
them
that
frequently
call
him
"
Old
Chap
"
be
likely
to
revive
his
spirit

<EOS>
Charley
direct
the
operation
and
go
to
and
fro
between
the
loft
-
room
and
the
house
with
such
little
stimulant
and
comfort
as
we
think
it
safe
to
give
him
.

My
guardian
himself
see
him
before
he
be
leave
for
the
night

report
to
me
when
he
return
to
the
growlery
to
write
a
letter

a
messenger
be

deliver
at

light

They

as
we
hear
at
a
distance
)
with
great
expression
and
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
rejoin
him
in
the
drawing
-
room
he
say
he
would
give
us
a
little
ballad
which
have
come
into
his
head
"
apropos
of
our
young
friend
,
"
and
he
sing
one
about
a
peasant
boy
,
      
"
Thrown
on
the
wide
world
,
doom
to
wander
and
roam
,
    
Bereft
of
his
parent
,
bereft
of
a
home
.
"
   
<EOS>
quite
exquisitely
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
song
that
always
make
him
cry
,
he
tell
us
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
extremely
gay
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
,
for
he
absolutely
chirp
---
those
be
his
delighted
word
---
when
he
think
by
what
a
happy
talent
for
business
he
be
surround
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
us
,
in
his
glass
of
negus
,
"
well
health
to
our
young
friend
!
"
and
suppose
and
gaily
pursue
the
case
of
his
be
reserve
like
Whittington
to
become
Lord
Mayor
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
in
that
event
,
no
doubt
,
he
would
establish
the
Jarndyce
Institution
and
the
Summerson
Almshouses
,
and
a
little
annual
Corporation
Pilgrimage
to
St
Albans
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
doubt
,
he
say
,
that
our
young
friend
be
an
excellent
boy
in
his
way
,
but
his
way
be
not
the
Harold
Skimpole
way
;
what
Harold
Skimpole
be
,
Harold
Skimpole
have
find
himself
,
to
his
considerable
surprise
,
when
he
first
make
his
own
acquaintance
;
he
have
accept
himself
with
all
his
failing
and
have
think
it
sound
philosophy
to
make
the
good
of
the
bargain
;
and
he
hope
we
would
do
the
same
.
   
<EOS>
Charley
's
last
report
be
that
the
boy
be
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
see
,
from
my
window
,
the
lantern
they
have
leave
him
burn
quietly
;
and
I
go
to
bed
very
happy
to
think
that
he
be
shelter
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
more
movement
and
more
talk
than
usual
a
little
before
daybreak
,
and
it
awake
me
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
be
dress
,
I
look
out
of
my
window
and
ask
one
of
our
man
who
have
be
among
the
active
sympathizer
last
night
whether
there
be
anything
wrong
about
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
the
lantern
be
still
burn
in
the
loft
-
window
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
boy
,
miss
,
"
say
he
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
he
bad
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
   
<EOS>
"
go
,
miss
.
   
<EOS>
"
dead
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
dead
,
miss
?
 
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
go
clean
off
.
"
   
<EOS>
at
what
time
of
the
night
he
have
go
,
or
how
,
or
why
,
it
seem
hopeless
ever
to
divine
.
 
<EOS>
the
door
remain
as
it
have
be
leave
,
and
the
lantern
stand
in
the
window
,
it
could
only
be
suppose
that
he
have
get
out
by
a
trap
in
the
floor
which
communicate
with
an
empty
cart
-
house
below
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
shut
it
down
again
,
if
that
be
so
;
and
it
look
as
if
it
have
not
be
raise
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
of
any
kind
be
miss
.
 
<EOS>
on
this
fact
be
clearly
ascertain
,
we
all
yield
to
the
painful
belief
that
delirium
have
come
upon
him
in
the
night
and
that
,
allure
by
some
imaginary
object
or
pursue
by
some
imaginary
horror
,
he
have
stray
away
in
that
bad
than
helpless
state
;
all
of
us
,
that
be
to
say
,
but
Mr
Skimpole
,
who
repeatedly
suggest
,
in
his
usual
easy
light
style
,
that
it
have
occur
to
our
young
friend
that
he
be
not
a
safe
inmate
,
have
a
bad
kind
of
fever
upon
him
,
and
that
he
have
with
great
natural
politeness
take
himself
off
.
   
<EOS>
every
possible
inquiry
be
make
,
and
every
place
be
search
.
 
<EOS>
the
brick
-
kiln
be
examine
,
the
cottage
be
visit
,
the
two
woman
be
particularly
question
,
but
they
know
nothing
of
him
,
and
nobody
could
doubt
that
their
wonder
be
genuine
.
 
<EOS>
the
weather
have
for
some
time
be
too
wet
and
the
night
itself
have
be
too
wet
to
admit
of
any
tracing
by
footstep
.
 
<EOS>
hedge
and
ditch
,
and
wall
,
and
rick
and
stack
,
be
examine
by
our
man
for
a
long
distance
round
,
lest
the
boy
should
be
lie
in
such
a
place
insensible
or
dead
;
but
nothing
be
see
to
indicate
that
he
have
ever
be
near
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
time
when
he
be
leave
in
the
loft
-
room
,
he
vanish
.
   
<EOS>
the
search
continue
for
five
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
that
it
cease
even
then
,
but
that
my
attention
be
then
divert
into
a
current
very
memorable
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
as
Charley
be
at
her
writing
again
in
my
room
in
the
evening
,
and
as
I
sit
opposite
to
her
at
work
,
I
feel
the
table
tremble
.
<EOS>
look
up
,
I
see
my
little
maid
shiver
from
head
to
foot
.
   
<EOS>
"
Charley
,
"
say
I
,
"
be
you
so
cold
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
be
,
miss
,
"
she
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
hold
myself
still
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
so
yesterday
at
about
this
same
time
,
miss
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
be
uneasy
,
I
think
I
be
ill
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
hear
Ada
's
voice
outside
,
and
I
hurry
to
the
door
of
communication
between
my
room
and
our
pretty
sitting
-
room
,
and
lock
it
.
 
<EOS>
just
in
time
,
for
she
tap
at
it
while
my
hand
be
yet
upon
the
key
.
   
<EOS>
Ada
call
to
me
to
let
her
in
,
but
I
say
,
"
not
now
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
the
matter
;
I
will
come
to
you
presently
.
"
 
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
,
long
time
before
my
darling
girl
<EOS>
and
I
be
companion
again
.
   
<EOS>
Charley
fall
ill
.
 
<EOS>
in
twelve
hour
she
be
very
ill
.
 
<EOS>
I
move
her
to
my
room
,
and
lay
her
in
my
bed
,
and
sit
down
quietly
to
nurse
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
my
guardian
all
about
it
,
and
why
I
feel
it
be
necessary
that
I
should
seclude
myself
,
and
my
reason
for
not
see
my
darling
above
all
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
she
come
very
often
to
the
door
,
and
call
to
me
,
and
even
reproach
me
with
sobs
and
tear
;
but
I
write
her
a
long
letter
say
that
she
make
me
anxious
and
unhappy
and
implore
her
,
as
she
love
me
and
wish
my
mind
to
be
at
peace
,
to
come
no
nearer
than
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
after
that
she
come
beneath
the
window
even
oftener
than
she
have
come
to
the
door
,
and
if
I
have
learn
to
love
her
dear
sweet
voice
before
when
we
be
hardly
ever
apart
<EOS>
,
how
do
I
learn
to
love
it
then
,
when
I
stand
behind
the
window
-
curtain
listening
and
reply
,
but
not
so
much
as
look
out
!
 
<EOS>
how
do
I
learn
to
love
it
afterwards
,
when
the
hard
time
come
!
   
<EOS>
They
put
a
bed
for
me
in
our
sitting
-
room
;
and
by
keep
the
door
wide
open
,
I
turn
the
two
room
into
one
,
now
that
Ada
have
vacate
that
part
of
the
house
,
and
keep
them
always
fresh
and
airy
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
servant
in
or
about
the
house
but
be
so
good
that
they
would
all
most
gladly
have
come
to
me
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
without
the
least
fear
or
unwillingness
,
but
I
think
it
best
to
choose
one
worthy
woman
who
be
never
to
see
Ada
and
whom
I
could
trust
to
come
and
go
with
all
precaution
.
 
<EOS>
through
her
mean
I
get
out
to
take
the
air
with
my
guardian
when
there
be
no
fear
of
meet
Ada
,
and
want
for
nothing
in
the
way
of
attendance
,
any
more
than
in
any
other
respect
.
   
<EOS>
and
thus
poor
Charley
sicken
and
grow
bad
,
and
fall
into
heavy
danger
of
death
,
and
lie
severely
ill
for
many
a
long
round
of
day
and
night
.
 
<EOS>
so
patient
she
be
,
so
uncomplaining
,
and
inspire
by
such
a
gentle
fortitude
that
very
often
as
I
sit
by
Charley
hold
her
head
in
my
arm
<EOS>
---
repose
would
come
to
her
,
so
,
when
it
would
come
to
her
in
no
other
attitude
---
I
silently
pray
to
our
Father
in
heaven
that
I
may
not
forget
the
lesson
which
this
little
sister
teach
me
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
very
sorrowful
to
think
that
Charley
's
pretty
look
would
change
and
be
disfigure
,
even
if
she
recover
---
she
be
such
a
child
with
her
dimpled
face
---
but
that
thought
be
,
for
the
great
part
,
lose
in
her
great
peril
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
be
at
the
bad
,
and
her
mind
ramble
again
to
the
care
of
her
father
's
sick
bed
and
the
little
child
,
she
still
know
me
so
far
as
that
she
would
be
quiet
in
my
arm
when
she
could
lie
quiet
nowhere
else
,
and
murmur
out
the
wandering
of
her
mind
less
restlessly
.
 
<EOS>
at
those
time
I
use
to
think
,
how
should
I
ever
tell
the
two
remain
baby
that
the
baby
who
have
learn
of
her
faithful
heart
to
be
a
mother
to
them
in
their
need
be
dead
!
   
<EOS>
there
be
other
time
when
Charley
know
me
well
and
talk
to
me
,
tell
me
that
she
send
her
love
to
Tom
and
Emma
and
that
she
be
sure
Tom
would
grow
up
to
be
a
good
man
.
 
<EOS>
at
those
time
Charley
would
speak
to
me
of
what
she
have
read
to
her
father
as
well
as
she
could
to
comfort
him
,
of
that
young
man
carry
out
to
be
bury
who
be
the
only
son
of
his
mother
and
she
be
a
widow
,
of
the
ruler
's
daughter
raise
up
by
the
gracious
hand
upon
her
bed
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
and
Charley
tell
me
that
when
her
father
die
she
have
kneel
down
and
pray
in
her
first
sorrow
that
he
likewise
may
be
raise
up
and
give
back
to
his
poor
child
,
and
that
if
she
should
never
get
well
and
should
die
too
,
she
think
it
likely
that
it
may
come
into
Tom
's
mind
to
offer
the
same
prayer
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
then
would
I
show
Tom
how
these
people
of
old
day
have
be
bring
back
to
life
on
earth
,
only
that
we
may
know
our
hope
to
be
restore
to
heaven
!
   
<EOS>
but
of
all
the
various
time
there
be
in
Charley
's
illness
,
there
be
not
one
when
she
lose
the
gentle
quality
I
have
speak
of
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
many
,
many
when
I
think
in
the
night
of
the
last
high
belief
in
the
watch
angel
,
and
the
last
high
trust
in
God
,
on
the
part
of
her
poor
despised
father
.
   
<EOS>
and
Charley
do
not
die
.
 
<EOS>
She
flutteringiy
and
slowly
turn
the
dangerous
point
,
after
long
linger
there
,
and
then
begin
to
mend
.
 
<EOS>
the
hope
that
never
have
be
give
,
from
the
first
,
of
Charley
be
in
outward
appearance
<EOS>
Charley
any
more
soon
begin
to
be
encourage
;
and
even
that
prospered
,
and
I
see
her
grow
into
her
old
childish
likeness
again
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
morning
when
I
could
tell
Ada
all
this
as
she
stand
out
in
the
garden
;
and
it
be
a
great
evening
when
Charley
and
I
at
last
take
tea
together
in
the
next
room
.
 
<EOS>
but
on
that
same
evening
,
I
feel
that
I
be
stricken
cold
.
   
<EOS>
happily
for
both
of
us
,
it
be
not
until
Charley
be
safe
in
bed
again
and
placidly
asleep
that
I
begin
to
think
the
contagion
of
her
illness
be
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
able
easily
to
hide
what
I
feel
at
tea
-
time
,
but
I
be
past
that
already
now
,
and
I
know
that
I
be
rapidly
follow
in
Charley
's
step
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
well
enough
,
however
,
to
be
up
early
in
the
morning
,
and
to
return
my
darling
's
cheerful
blessing
from
the
garden
,
and
to
talk
with
her
as
long
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
free
from
an
impression
that
I
have
be
walk
about
the
two
room
in
the
night
,
a
little
beside
myself
,
though
know
where
I
be
;
and
<EOS>
I
feel
confused
at
time
---
with
a
curious
sense
of
fullness
,
as
if
I
be
become
too
large
altogether
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
evening
I
be
so
much
bad
that
I
resolve
to
prepare
Charley
,
with
which
view
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
You
be
get
quite
strong
,
Charley
,
be
you
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
quite
!
"
say
Charley
.
   
<EOS>
"
strong
enough
to
be
tell
a
secret
,
I
think
,
Charley
?
"
   
"
quite
strong
enough
for
that
,
miss
!
"
cry
Charley
.
 
<EOS>
but
Charley
's
face
fall
in
the
height
of
her
delight
,
for
she
see
the
secret
in
my
face
;
and
she
come
out
of
the
great
chair
,
and
fall
upon
my
bosom
,
and
say
"
oh
,
miss
,
it
be
my
doing
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
my
doing
!
"
<EOS>
and
a
great
deal
more
out
of
the
fullness
of
her
grateful
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
Charley
,
"
say
I
after
let
her
go
on
for
a
little
while
,
"
if
I
be
to
be
ill
,
my
great
trust
,
humanly
speak
,
be
in
you
.
<EOS>
and
unless
you
be
as
quiet
and
compose
for
me
as
you
always
be
for
yourself
,
you
can
never
fulfil
it
,
Charley
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
let
me
cry
a
little
longer
,
miss
,
"
say
Charley
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
my
dear
,
my
dear
!
 
<EOS>
if
you
will
only
let
me
cry
a
little
longer
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
my
dear
!
"
<EOS>
---
how
affectionately
and
devotedly
she
pour
this
out
<EOS>
as
she
cling
to
my
neck
,
I
never
can
remember
without
tear
---

more

Mr

closer

into
a
whisper

<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what

<EOS>
the
first
thing
to
be
do
be
to
make
another

one
so
that
if
he
should
ask
to
see
the
real
one
while
it
be
in

possession
,
you
can
show
him
the
dummy
.

"
   
<EOS>
"
and
suppose
he
detect
the
dummy
as
soon
as
he
see
it
,
which
with
his
biting
screw
of
an
eye
be
about
five
hundred
time
more
likely

not

suggest
Tony
.
   
<EOS>
"
then
we
will
face
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
They
do
not
belong
to
him
,
and
they
never
do
.
 
<EOS>
You
find
that
,
and
you
place
them
in
my
hand

a
legal
friend
of
yours

for
security
.

if
he
force
us
to
it

they

gravely

<EOS>
"
and
what
do
you

Mr

a

;

on
his
friend

once
more
warn
him
,
"
I
tell

you

only
the
word

<EOS>
"
well

Mr

.
 
<EOS>
"
and
we
have
better
be
that
than
a
pair
of
noodle

which
we
should
be
if

do
anything
else
,
for
it
be
the
only
way

do
what
we
want
to
do

<EOS>
secondly
?
"
   
"
secondly
,
it
be
not
make
out
to
me
how
it
be
likely
to
be
profitable
,
after
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Guppy
cast
up
his
eye
at
the
portrait
of
Lady
Dedlock
over
the
mantelshelf
and
reply
,
<EOS>
"
Tony
,
you
be
ask
to
leave
that
to
the
honour
of
your
friend
.
 
<EOS>
besides
its
be
calculate
to
serve
that
friend
in
those
chord
of
the
human
mind
which
---
which
need
not
be
call
into
agonizing
vibration
on
the
present
occasion

your
friend
be
no
fool

<EOS>
what
be
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
eleven
o'clock
strike
by
the
bell
of
Saint
Paul
's
.
 
<EOS>
listen
and
you
will
hear
all
the
bell
in
the
city
jangle
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
both
sit
silent
,
listen
to
the
metal
voice
,
near
and
distant
,
resound
from
tower
of
various
height
,
in
tone
more
various
than
their
situation
.
 
<EOS>
when
these
at
length
cease
,
all
seem
more
mysterious
and
quiet
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
one
disagreeable
result
of
whispering
be
that
it
seem
to
evoke
an
atmosphere
of
silence
,
haunt
by
the
ghost
of
sound
---
<EOS>
strange
crack
and
ticking
,
the
rustling
of
garment
that
have
no
substance
in
them
,
and
the
tread
of
dreadful
foot
that
would
leave
no
mark
on
the
sea
-
sand
or
the
winter
snow
.
 
<EOS>
so
sensitive
the
two
friend
happen
to
be
that
the
air
be
full
of
these
phantom

the
two
look
over
their
shoulder
by
one
consent
to
see
that
the
door
be
shut

<EOS>
"
yes

Tony

Mr

draw
nearer

You
be
go
to

thirdly

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>

It
be
far
from

pleasant
thing

about

when

<EOS>
the
two
look
at
each
other
again
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Guppy
make
a
hurried
remark
to
the
effect
that
they
may
be
do
the
deceased
a
service
,
that
he
hope
so
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
oppressive
blank
until
Mr
Weevle
,
by
stir
the
fire
suddenly
,
make
Mr

start
as
if
his
heart
have

a
bit

mouthful
of

close

<EOS>
He
raise
the
sash

they
both
rest
on
the
window

sill
,
half
in

half
out
of
the
room

<EOS>
the
neighbouring
house
be
too
near
to
admit
of
their
see
any
sky
without
crane
their
neck
and
look
up
,
but
light
in
frowsy
window
here

there

and
the
rolling
of
distant
carriage

the
new
expression

there
be
of
the
stir

find
to
be
comfortable

Mr

noiselessly

on

resume
his

this

some

meanwhile

very
generally
express
at
the
bar
by
a
large
body

respectable
individual

in
homage
to
a
late
melancholy
event
which
have
arouse
so
much
sensation

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
one
point
connect
with
the
deceased
upon
which
the
court
be
particularly
anxious
,
namely
,
that
the
fiction
of
a
full
-
sized
coffin
should
be
preserve
,
though
there
be
so
little
to
put
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
upon
the
undertaker
's
stating
in
the
Sol

bar
in
the
course
of
the
day
that
he
have
receive
order
to
construct
"
a
six

footer
,
"
the
general
solicitude
be
much
relieved
,
and
it
be
consider
that
Mr
Smallweed
's
conduct
do
him
great
honour
.
   
<EOS>
out
of
the
court
,
and
a
long
way
out
of
it
,
there
be
considerable
excitement
too
,
for
man
of
science
and
philosophy
come
to
look
,
and
carriage
set
down
doctor
at
the
corner
who
arrive
with
the
same
intent
,
and
there
be
more
learned
talk
about
inflammable
gas
and
phosphurette
hydrogen
than
the
court
have
ever
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
these
authority
(
of
course
the
wise
)
hold
with
indignation
that
the
deceased
have
no
business
to
die
in
the
alleged
manner
;
and
be
remind
by
other
authority
of
a
certain
inquiry
into
the
evidence
for
such
death
reprint
in
the
sixth
volume
of
the
Philosophical
Transactions
;
and
also
of
a
book
not
quite
unknown
on
english
medical
jurisprudence
;
and
likewise
of
the
italian
case
of
the
Countess
Cornelia
Baudi
as
set
forth
in
detail
by
one
Bianchini
,
prebendary
of
Verona
,
who
write
a
scholarly
work
or
so
and
be
occasionally
hear
of
in
his
time
as
have
gleam
of
reason
in
him
;
and
also
of
the
testimony
of
Messrs.
Fodere
and
Mere
,
two
pestilent
frenchman
who
WOULD
investigate
the
subject
;
and
further
,
of
the
corroborative
testimony
of
Monsieur
Le
Cat
,
a
rather
celebrate
french
surgeon
once
upon
a
time
,
who
have
the
unpoliteness
to
live
in
a
house
where
such
a
case
occur
and
even
to
write
an
account
of
it
<EOS>
---
still
they
regard
the
late
Mr
Krook
's
obstinacy
in
go
out
of
the
world
by
any
such
by
-
way
as
wholly
unjustifiable
and
personally
offensive
.
 
<EOS>
the
less
the
court
understand
of
all
this
<EOS>
,
the
more
the
court
like
it
,
and
the
great
enjoyment
it
have
in
the
stock
in
trade
of
the
Sol
's
arm
.
<EOS>
then
there
come
the
artist
of
a

figure
ready

for
anything
from
a
wreck

he
then
and
there
throw
in
upon
the
block
Mr
Krook
's
house
,
as
large
as

very
temple

all
this
time
the
two

the
philosophical
disputation

to
everybody

and
yet
be
always
dive
into
the
Sol
's
parlour
and
write
with
the
ravenous
little
pen
on
the
tissue

paper
.
   
<EOS>
at
last
come
the
coroner
and
his
inquiry
,
like
as
before
,
except
that
the
coroner
cherish
this
case
as
be
out
of
the
common
way
and
tell
the
gentleman
of
the
jury
,
in
his
private
capacity
,
that
"
that
would
seem
to
be
an
unlucky
house
next

a
destine
house

but
so
we
sometimes
find
it

these

not
account
for

"
 
<EOS>
after
which
the
six

footer
come
into
action
and
be
much
admire
.
   
<EOS>
in
all
these
proceeding
Mr
Guppy
have
so
slight
a
part
,
except
when
he
give
his
evidence
,
that
he
be
move
on
like
a
private
individual
and
can
only
haunt
the
secret
house
on
the
outside
,
where
he
have
the
mortification
of
see
Mr
Smallweed
padlock
the
door
,
and
of
bitterly
know
himself
to
be
shut
out
.
 
<EOS>
but
before
these
proceeding
draw
to
a
close
,
that
be
to
say
,
on
the
night
next
after
the
catastrophe
,
Mr
Guppy
have
a
thing
to
say
that
must
be
say
to
Lady
Dedlock
.
   
<EOS>
for
which
reason
,
with
a
sink
heart
and
with
that
hang

dog
sense
of
guilt
upon
him
which
dread
and
watch
enfold
in
the
Sol
's
arm
have
produce
,
the
young
man
of
the
name
of
Guppy
present
himself
at
the
town
mansion
at
about
seven
o'clock
in
the

and
request

<EOS>
Mercury

that
she

<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
Mercury

he
will
presently
declare
to
a
fellow

gentleman
in
wait
,
"
to
pitch
into
the
young
man
"
;
but
his
instruction
be
positive
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
he
sulkily
suppose
that
the
young
man
must
come
up
into
the
library
.
 
<EOS>
there
he
leave
the
young
man
in
a
large
room
,
not
over

light

while
he
make
report
of
him
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Guppy
look
into
the
shade
in
all
direction
,
discover
everywhere
a
certain
char
and
whiten
little
heap

<EOS>
presently

<EOS>
no

it
be
no

most
brilliantly
dressed

<EOS>
"
I
have

pardon

very
downcast

She
take

Your

You

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
Mr

depress

disappoint

and
uneasy
,
be
put
at
a
further
disadvantage
by
the
splendour
and
beauty
of
her
appearance

<EOS>
She
know
its
influence
perfectly
,
have
study
it
too
well
to
miss
a
grain
of
its
effect
on
any
one

<EOS>
as
she
look
at
him
so
steadily
and
coldly
,
he
not
only
feel
conscious
that
he
have
no
guide
in
the

perception
of
what
be
really
the
complexion

remove
further

further
from
her

<EOS>
She
will
not

<EOS>
so
he
must

<EOS>
"
in

<EOS>
and
the

"
   
<EOS>
Mr

would
say
no
if
he
could
---
as
he
be
unable
to
hide
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so

your

"
   
<EOS>
if
he
could
see
the

sparkle
of
relief
in
her
face
now
?
 
<EOS>
no
,
he
could
see
no
such
thing
,
even
if
that
brave
outside
do
not
utterly
put
him
away
,
and
he
be
not
look
beyond
it
and
about
it
.
   
<EOS>
He
falter
an
awkward
excuse
or
two
for
his
failure

<EOS>
"
be
this
all

?
<EOS>
"
inquire
Lady
Dedlock
,
have
hear
him
out

or
as
nearly
out
as
he
can
stumble
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Guppy
think
that
be
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
better
be
sure
that
you

nothing
more

have
the
opportunity

"
   
<EOS>
Mr

be
quite
sure

<EOS>
and
indeed
he
have
no

by
any
mean

"
that

but
in

,
I
can
do
this
for
you
---
<EOS>
I
can
replace
this
matter
on
its
old
footing
,
and
I
can
go
so
far
besides
as
to
give
you
a
write
undertaking
that
this
man
Bagnet
shall
never
be
trouble
in
any
way
until
you
have
be
proceed
against
to
the
utmost
,
that
your
mean
shall
be
exhaust
before
the
creditor
look
to
his
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
in
fact
all
but
free
him
.
 
<EOS>
have
you
decide
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
trooper
put
his
hand
into
his
breast
and
answer
with
a
long
breath
,
"
I
must
do
it
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
so
Mr
Tulkinghorn
,
put
on
his
spectacle
,
sit
down
and
write
the
undertaking
,
which
he
slowly
read
and
explain
to
Bagnet
,
who
have
all
this
time
be
stare
at
the
ceiling
and
who
put
his
hand
on
his
bald
head
again
,
under
this
new
verbal
shower
-
bath
,
and
seem
exceedingly
in
need
of
the
old
girl
through
whom
to
express
his
sentiment
.
 
<EOS>
the
trooper
then
take
from
his
breast
-
pocket
a
fold
paper
,
which
he
lay
with
an
unwilling
hand
at
the
lawyer
's
elbow
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
only
a
letter
of
instruction
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
the
last
I
ever
have
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
look
at
a
millstone
,
Mr
George
,
for
some
change
in
its
expression
,
and
you
will
find
it
quite
as
soon
as
in
the
face
of
Mr
Tulkinghorn
when
he
open
and
read
the
letter
!
 
<EOS>
He
refold
it
and
lay
it
in
his
desk
with
a
countenance
as
unperturbable
as
death
.
   
<EOS>
nor
have
he
anything
more
to
say
or
do
but
to
nod
once
in
the
same
frigid
and
discourteous
manner
and
to
say
briefly
,
"
You
can
go
.
<EOS>
show
these
man
out
,
there
!
"
 
<EOS>
be
show
out
,
they
repair
to
Mr
Bagnet
's
residence
to
dine
.
   
<EOS>
boil
beef
and
green
constitute
the
day
's
variety
on
the
former
repast
of
boil
pork
and
green
,
and
Mrs
Bagnet
serve
out
the
meal
in
the
same
way
and
season
it
with
the
good
of
temper
,
be
that
rare
sort
of
old
girl
that
she
receive
good
to
her
arm
without
a
hint
that
it
may
be
well
and
catch
light
from
any
little
spot
of
darkness
near
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
spot
on
this
occasion
be
the
darken
brow
of
Mr
George
;
he
be
unusually
thoughtful
and
depressed
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
Mrs
Bagnet
trust
to
the
combined
endearment
of
Quebec
and
Malta
to
restore
him
,
but
find
those
young
lady
sensible
that
their
exist
Bluffy
be
not
the
Bluffy
of
their
usual
frolicsome
acquaintance
,
she
wink
off
the
light
infantry
and
leave
him
to
deploy
at
leisure
on
the
open
ground
of
the
domestic
hearth
.
   
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
He
remain
in
close
order
,
cloud
and
depressed
.
<EOS>
during
the
lengthy
cleaning
up
and
pattene
process
,
when
he
and
Mr
Bagnet
be
supply
with
their
pipe
,
he
be
no
well
than
he
be
at
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
He
forget
to
smoke
,
look
at
the
fire
and
ponder
,
let
his
pipe
out
,
fill
the
breast
of
Mr
Bagnet
with
perturbation
and
dismay
by
show
that
he
have
no
enjoyment
of
tobacco
.
   
<EOS>
therefore
when
Mrs
Bagnet
at
last
appear
,
rosy
from
the
invigorate
pail
,
and
sit
down
to
her
work
,
Mr
Bagnet
growl
,
"

"
and
winks
monition
to
her
to
find
out
what
be
the
matter

"

so
far

wooden

high
approbation

acquiescence

<EOS>
Esther
's
Narrative
 
<EOS>
I
lie
ill
through
several
week
,
and
the
usual
tenor
of
my
life
become
like
an
old
remembrance
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
the
effect
of
time
so
much
as
of
the
change
in
all
my
habit
make
by
the
helplessness
and
inaction
of
a
sick
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
before
I
have
be
confine
to
it
many
day
,
everything
else
seem
to
have
retire
into
a
remote
distance
where
there
be
little
or
no
separation
between
the
various
stage
of
my
life
which
have
be
really
divide
by
year
.
 
<EOS>
in
fall
ill
,
I
seem
to
have
cross
a
dark
lake
and
to
have
leave
all
my
experience
,
mingle
together
by
the
great
distance
,
on
the
healthy
shore
.
   
<EOS>
My
housekeeping
duty
,
though
at
first
it
cause
me
great
anxiety
to
think
that
they
be
unperformed
,
be
soon
as
far
off
as
the
old
of
the
old
duty
at
Greenleaf
or
the
summer
afternoon
when
I
go
home
from
school
with
my
portfolio
under
my
arm
,
and
my
childish
shadow
at
my
side
,
to
my
godmother
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
know
before
how
short
life
really
be
and
into
how
small
a
space
<EOS>
the
mind
could
put
it
.
   
<EOS>
while
I
be
very
ill
,
the
way
in
which
these
division
of
time
become
confused
with
one
another
distress
my
mind
exceedingly
.
<EOS>
at
once
a
child
,
an
eld
girl
,
and
the
little
woman
I
have
be
so
happy
as
,
I
be
not
only
oppress
by
care
and
difficulty
adapt
to
each
station
,
but
by
the
great
perplexity
of
endlessly
try
to
reconcile
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
that
few
who
have
not
be
in
such
a
condition
can
quite
understand
what
I
mean
or
what
painful
unrest
arise
from
this
source
.
   
<EOS>
for
the
same
reason
I
be
almost
afraid
to
hint
at
that
time
in
my
disorder
---
it
seem
one
long
night
,
but
I
believe
there
be
both
night
and
day
in
it
---
when
I
labour
up
colossal
staircase
,
ever
strive
to
reach
the
top
,
and
ever
turn
,
as
I
have
see
a
worm
in
a
garden
path
,
by
some
obstruction
,
and
labour
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
perfectly
at
interval
,
and
I
think
vaguely
at
most
time
,
that
I
be
in
my
bed
;
and
I
talk
with
Charley
,
and
feel
her
touch
,
and
know
her
very
well
;
yet
I
would
find
myself
complain
,
"
oh
,
more
of
these
never
-
end
stair
,
Charley
---
more
and
more
---
pile
up
to
the
sky
,
I
think
!
"
<EOS>
and
labour
on
again
.
   
<EOS>
dare
<EOS>
I
hint
at
that
bad
time
when
,
string
together
somewhere
in
great
black
space
,
there
be
a
flaming
necklace
,
or
ring
,
or
starry
circle
of
some
kind
,
of
which
I
be
one
of
the
bead
!
 
<EOS>
and
when
my
only
prayer
be
to
be
take
off
from
the
rest
and
when
it
be
such
inexplicable
agony
and
misery
to
be
a
part
of
the
dreadful
thing
?
   
<EOS>
perhaps
the
less
I
say
of
these
sick
experience
,
the
less
tedious
and
the
more
intelligible
I
shall
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
recall
them
to
make
other
unhappy
or
because
I
be
now
the
least
unhappy
in
remember
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
if
we
know
more
of
such
strange
affliction
we
may
be
the
better
able
to
alleviate
their
intensity
.
   
<EOS>
the
repose
that
succeed
,
the
long
delicious
sleep
,
the
blissful
rest
,
when
in
my
weakness
I
be
too
calm
to
have
any
care
for
myself
and
could
have
hear
(
or
<EOS>
so
I
think
now
)
that
I
be
die
,
with
no
other
emotion
than
with
a
pity
love
for
those
I
leave
behind
<EOS>
---
this
state
can
be
perhaps
more
widely
understand
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
in
this
state
when
I
first
shrink
from
the
light
as
it
twinkle
on
me
once
more
,
and
know
with
a
boundless
joy
for
which
no
word
be
rapturous
enough
that
I
should
see
again
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
hear
my
Ada
cry
at
the
door
,
day
and
night
;
I
have
hear
her
call
to
me
that
I
be
cruel
and
do
not
love
her
;
I
have
hear
her
pray
and
implore
to
be
let
in
to
nurse
and
comfort
me
and
to
leave
my
bedside
no
more
;
but
I
have
only
say
,
when
I
could
speak
,
"
never
,
my
sweet
girl
,
never
!
"
<EOS>
and
I
have
over
and
over
again
remind
Charley
that
she
be
to
keep
my
darling
from
the
room
whether
I
live
or
die
.
 
<EOS>
Charley
have
be
true
to
me
in
that
time
of
need
,
and
with
her
little
hand
and
her
great
heart
have
keep
the
door
fast
.
   
<EOS>
but
now
,
my
sight
strengthening
and
the
glorious
light
come
every
day
more
fully
and
brightly
on
me
,
I
could
read
the
letter
that
my
dear
write
to
me
every
morning
and
evening
and
could
put
them
to
my
lip
and
lay
my
cheek
upon
them
with
no
fear
of
hurt
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
see
my
little
maid
,
so
tender
and
so
careful
,
go
about
the
two
room
set
everything
in
order
and
speak
cheerfully
to
Ada
from
the
open
window
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
understand
the
stillness
in
the
house
and
the
thoughtfulness
it
express
on
the
part
of
all
those
who
have
always
be
so
good
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
weep
in
the
exquisite
felicity
of
my
heart
and
be
as
happy
in
my
weakness
as
ever
I
have
be
in
my
strength
.
   
<EOS>
by
and
by
my
strength
begin
to
be
restore
.
 
<EOS>
instead
of
lie
,
with
so
strange
a
calmness
,
watch
what
be
do
for
me
,
as
if
it
be
do
for
some
one
else
whom
I
be
quietly
sorry
for
,
I
help
it
a
little
,
and
so
on
to
a
little
more
and
much
more
,
until
I
become
useful
to
myself
,
and
interested
,
and
attach
to
life
again
.
   
<EOS>
how
well
I
remember
the
pleasant
afternoon
when
I
be
raise
in
bed
with
pillow
for
the
first
time
to
enjoy
a
great
tea
-
drinking
with
Charley
!
 
<EOS>
the
little
creature
---
send
into
the
world
,
surely
,
to
minister
to
the
weak
and
sick
---
be
so
happy
,
and
so
busy
,
and
stop
so
often
in
her
preparation
to
lay
her
head
upon
my
bosom
,
and
fondle
me
,
and
cry
with
joyful
tear
<EOS>
she
be
so
glad
<EOS>
,
she
be
so
glad
,
that
I
be
oblige
to
say
,
"
Charley
,
if
you
go
on
in
this
way
,
I
must
lie
down
again
,
my
darling
,
for
I
be
weak
than
I
think
I
be
!
"
 
<EOS>
so
Charley
become
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
and
take
her
bright
face
here
and
there
across
and
across
the
two
room
,
out
of
the
shade
into
the
divine
sunshine
,
and
out
of
the
sunshine
into
the
shade
,
while
I
watch
her
peacefully
.
 
<EOS>
when
all
her
preparation
be
conclude
and
the
pretty
tea
-
table
with
its
little
delicacy
to
tempt
me
,
and
its
white
cloth
,
and
its
flower
,
and
everything
so
lovingly
and
beautifully
arrange
for
me
by
Ada
downstairs
,
be
ready
at
the
bedside
,
I
feel
sure
I
be
steady
enough
to
say
something
to
Charley
that
be
not
new
to
my
thought
.
   
<EOS>
first
I
compliment
Charley
on
the
room
,
and
indeed
it
be
so
fresh
and
airy
,
so
spotless
and
neat
,
that
I
could
scarce
believe
I
have
be
lie
there
so
long
.
 
<EOS>
this
delight
Charley
,
and
<EOS>
her
face
be
bright
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yet
,
Charley
,
"
say
I
,
look
round
,
"
I
miss
something
,
surely
,
that
I
be
accustomed
to
?
"
   
<EOS>
poor
little
Charley
look
round
too
and
pretend
to
shake
her
head
as
if
there
be
nothing
absent
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
the
picture
all
as
they
use
to
be
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
every
one
of
them
,
miss
,
"
say
Charley
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
the
furniture
,
Charley
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
except
where
I
have
move
it
about
to
make
more
room
,
miss
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
yet
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
miss
some
familiar
object
.
 
<EOS>
ah
,
I
know
what
it
be
,
Charley
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
looking
-
glass
.
"
   
<EOS>
Charley
get
up
from
the
table
,
make
as
if
she
have
forget
something
,
and
go
into
the
next
room
;
and
I
hear
her
sob
there
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
think
of
this
very
often
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
now
certain
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
thank
God
that
it
be
not
a
shock
to
me
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
call
Charley
back
,
and
when
she
come
---
at
first
pretend
to
smile
,
but
as
she
draw
near
to
me
,
look
grieved
<EOS>
---
I
take
her
in
my
arm
and
say
,
"
It
matter
very
little
,
Charley
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
can
do
without
my
old
face
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
presently
so
far
advanced
as
to
be
able
to
sit
up
in
a
great
chair
and
even
giddily
to
walk
into
the
adjoining
room
,
lean
on
Charley
.
 
<EOS>
the
mirror
be
go
from
its
usual
place
in
that
room
too
,
but
what
I
have
to
bear
be
none
the
hard
to
bear
for
that
.
   
<EOS>
My
guardian
have
throughout
be
earnest
to
visit
me
,
and
there
be
now
no
good
reason
why
I
should
deny
myself
that
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
one
morning
,
and
when
he
first
come
in
,
could
only
hold
me
in
his
embrace
and
say
,
"
My
dear
,
dear
girl
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
have
long
know
---
who
could
know
better
?
---
what
a
deep
fountain
of
affection
and
generosity
his
heart
be
;
and
be
it
not
worth
my
trivial
suffering
and
change
to
fill
such
a
place
in
it
?
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
!
"
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
have
see
me
,
and
he
love
me
better
than
he
do
;
he
have
see
me
and
be
even
fonder
of
me
than
he
be
before
;
and
what
have
I
to
mourn
for
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
sit
down
by
me
on
the
sofa
,
support
me
with
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
little
while
he
sit
with
his
hand
over
his
face
,
but
when
he
remove
it
,
fall
into
his
usual
manner
.
 
<EOS>
there
never
can
have
be
,
there
never
can
be
,
a
pleasanter
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
little
woman
,
"
say
he
,
"
what
a
sad
time
this
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
such
an
inflexible
little
woman
,
too
,
through
all
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
only
for
the
good

guardian

I.
   
"
<EOS>
for
the
good
?
"
he
repeat
tenderly
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of
course
,
for
the
good
.
<EOS>
but
here
have
Ada
and
I
be
perfectly
forlorn
and
miserable
;
<EOS>
here
have
your
friend
Caddy
be
come
and
go
late
and
early
;
here
have
every
one
about
the
house
be
utterly
lose
and
dejected
;
here
have
even
poor
Rick
be
write
---
to
me
too
---
in
his
anxiety
for
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
have
read
of
Caddy
in
Ada
's
letter
,
but
not
of
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
no
,
my
dear
,
"
he
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
think
it
better
not
to
mention
it
to
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
and
you
speak
of
his
writing
to
you
,
"
say
I
,
repeat
his
emphasis
.
 
<EOS>
"
as
if
it
be
not
natural
for
him
to
do
so
,
guardian
;
as
if
he
could
write
to
a
well
friend
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
think
he
could
,
my
love
,
"
return
my
guardian
,
"
and
to
many
a
well
.
 
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
he
write
to
me
under
a
sort
of
protest
while
unable
to
write
to
you
with
any
hope
of
an
answer
---
write
coldly
,
haughtily
,
distantly
,
resentfully
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
dear
little
woman
,
we
must
look
forbearingly
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
to
blame
.
 
<EOS>
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
have
warp
him
out
of
himself
and
pervert
me
in
his
eye
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
know
it
do
as
bad
deed
,
and
bad
,
many
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
if
two
angel
could
be
concern
in
it
,
I
believe
it
would
change
their
nature

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
have
not
change
your
,
guardian

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
it
have
,
my
dear
,
"
he
say
laughingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
have
make
the
south
wind
easterly

I
do
not
know
how
often

<EOS>
Rick
mistrust
and
suspect
me
---
go
to
lawyer
,
and
be
teach
to
mistrust

Hears
I
have
conflict
interest

against
his

not

Whereas
<EOS>
,
heaven
know
that
if
I
could
get
out
of
the
mountain
of
wiglomeration
on
which
my
unfortunate
name
have
be
so
long
bestow
(
which
I
can
not

or
could
level
them
by
the
extinction
of
my
own
original
right
(
which
I
can
not
either
,
and
no
human
power
ever
can

anyhow

I
believe
,
to
such
a
pass
have
we
get
)
,
I
would
do
it
this
hour
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
rather
restore
to
poor
Rick
his
proper
nature
than
be
endow
with
all
the
money
that
dead
suitor
,
break
,
heart
and
soul
,
upon
the
wheel
of
Chancery
,
have
leave
unclaimed
with
the
Accountant
-
General
---
and
that
be
money
enough
,
my
dear
,
to
be
cast
into
a
pyramid
,
in
memory
of
Chancery
's
transcendent
wickedness
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
be
it
possible
,
guardian
,
"
I
ask
,
amazed
,
"
that
Richard
can
be
suspicious
of
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
ah
,
<EOS>
my
love
,
my
love
,
"
he
say
,
"
it
be
in
the
subtle
poison
of
such
abuse
to
breed
such
disease
.
 
<EOS>
His
blood
be
infect
,
and
object
lose
their
natural
aspect
in
his
sight

<EOS>
It
be
not
his
fault

"
   
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
a
terrible
misfortune

guardian

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
terrible
misfortune
,
little
woman
,
to
be
ever
draw
within
the
influence
of
Jarndyce

Jarndyce

<EOS>
I
know
none
great

<EOS>
by
little
and
little
he
have
be
induce
to
trust
in
that
rotten
reed
,
and
it
communicate
some
portion
of
its
rottenness
to
everything
around
him

<EOS>
but
again
I
say
with
all
my
soul
,
we
must
be
patient
with
poor
Rick
and
not
blame
him
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
troop
of
fine
fresh
heart
like
his
have
<EOS>
I
see
in
my
time
<EOS>
turn
by
the
same
mean

"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
express
something
of
my
wonder
and
regret
that
his
benevolent
,
disintereste
intention
have
prosper
so
little

<EOS>
"
We
must
not

so

Dame
Durden

he
cheerfully
rephe
;
"
Ada
be
the
happy

I
hope
,

that
be
much

<EOS>
I
do
think
that
I
and
both
these
young
creature
may
be
friend
instead
of
distrustful
foe
and
that
we
may
so
far
counter
-
act
the
suit
and
prove
too
strong
for
it

<EOS>
but
it
be
too
much
to
expect
.
 
<EOS>
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
be
the
curtain
of
Rick
's
cradle

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
,
guardian
,
may
we
not
hope
that
a
little
experience
will
teach
him
what
a
false
and
wretched
thing
it
be
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
WILL
hope
so
,
my
Esther
,
"
say
Mr
Jarndyce
,
"
and
that
it
may
not
teach
him
so
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
in
any
case
we
must
not
be
hard
on
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
many
grow
and
mature
man
live
while
we
speak
,
good
man
too
,
who
if
they
be
throw
into
this
same
court
as
suitor
would
not
be
vitally
change
and
depreciate
within
three
year
---
within
two
---
within
one

<EOS>
how
can
we
stand
amazed
at
poor
Rick
?
 
<EOS>
a
young
man
so
unfortunate
,
"
here
he
fall
into
a
low
tone
,
as
if
he
be
think
aloud
,
"
can
not
at
first
believe
(
who
could
?
)
<EOS>
that
chancery
be
what
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
to
it
,
flush
and
fitfully
,
to
do
something
with
his
interest
and
bring
them
to
some
settlement
.
 
<EOS>
It
procrastinate
,
disappoint
,
try
,
torture
him
;
wear
out
his
sanguine
hope
and
patience
,
thread
by
thread
;
but
he
still
look
to
it
,
and
hanker
after
it
,
and
find
his
whole
world
treacherous
and
hollow
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
well
,
well
!
 
<EOS>
enough
of
this
,
my
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
have
support
me
,
as
at
first
,
all
this
time
,
and
his
tenderness
be
so
precious
to
me
that
I
lean
my
head
upon
his
shoulder
and
love
him
as
if
he
have
be
my
father

<EOS>
I
resolve
in
my
own
mind
in
this
little
pause
,
by
some
mean
,
to
see
Richard
when
I
grow
strong
and
try
to
set
him
right

"
there
be
well
subject
than
these

"
for
such
a
joyful
time
as
the
time
of
our
dear
girl
's
recovery

I
have
a
commission
to
broach
one
of
them
as
soon
as
I
should
begin
to
talk
.
<EOS>
when
shall
Ada
come
to
see
you
,
my
love
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
have
be
think
of
that
too
.
 
<EOS>
a
little
in
connexion
with
the
absent
mirror
,
but
not
much
,
for
I
know
my
loving
girl
would
be
change
by
no
change
in
my
look
.
   
<EOS>
"
dear
guardian
,
"
say
I
,
"
as
I
have
shut
her
out
so
long
---
though
indeed
,
indeed
<EOS>
,
she
be
like
the
light
to
me
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
well

Dame
Durden

well

<EOS>
He
be
so
good
,
his
touch
express
such
endearing
compassion
and
affection
,
and
the
tone
of
his
voice
carry
such
comfort
into
my
heart
that
I
stop
for
a
little
while
,
quite
unable
to
go
on

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes

yes

you
be
tired

he
,
"

rest
a
little
.

<EOS>
"
as
I
have
keep
Ada
out
so
long

I
begin
afresh
after
a
short
while

I
think
I
should
like
to
have
my
own
way
a
little
longer
,
guardian

<EOS>
It
would
be
good
to
be
away
from
here
before
I
see
her
.
<EOS>
if
Charley
and
I
be
to
go
to
some
country
lodge
as
soon
as
I
can
move
,
and
if
I
have
a
week
there
in
which
to
grow
strong
and
to
be
revive
by
the
sweet
air
and
to
look
forward
to
the
happiness
of
have
Ada
with
me
again
,
I
think
it
would
be
well
for
us
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
hope
it
be
not
a
poor
thing
in
me
to
wish
to
be
a
little
more
used
to
my
altered
self
before
I
meet
the
eye
of
the
dear
girl
I
long
so
ardently
to
see
,
but
it
be
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
understand
me
,
I
be
sure
;
but
I
be
not
afraid
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
be
a
poor
thing
,
I
know
he
would
pass
it
over
.
   
<EOS>
"
Our
spoilt
little
woman
,
"
say
my
guardian
,
"
shall
have
her
own
way
even
in
her
inflexibility

though
at
the
price

I
know
,
of
tear
downstairs

<EOS>
and
see
here
!
 
<EOS>
here
be
Boythorn

heart
of
chivalry

breathe
such
ferocious
vow

never
be
breathe
on
paper
before

that
if
you
do
not
go
and
occupy
his
whole
house

he
have
already
turn
out
of
it
expressly
for
that
purpose

by
heaven

by
earth
he
will
pull
it
down
and
not
leave
one
brick
stand
on
another
!

<EOS>
and
my
guardian
put
a
letter
in
my
hand
,
without
any
ordinary
beginning
such
as
"
My
dear
Jarndyce
,
"
but
rush
at
once
into
the
word
<EOS>
,
"
I
swear
if
Miss
Summerson
do
not
come
down
and
take
possession
of
my
house
,
which
I
vacate
for
her
this
day
at
one
o'clock

pm

"
and
then
with
the
utmost
seriousness
,
and
in
the
most
emphatic
term
,
go
on
to
make
the
extraordinary
declaration
he
have
quote
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
not
appreciate
the
writer
the
less
for
laugh
heartily
over
it
,
and
we
settle
that
I
should
send
him
a
letter
of
thank
on
the
morrow

accept
his
offer

It
be
a
most
agreeable
one
to
me

could
have

go

none
so
well

Chesney
Wold

"
now

little
housewife
,
"
say
my
guardian

look
at
his
watch

I
be
strictly
time
before
I
come
upstairs
,
for
you
must
not
be
tired
too
soon

my
time
have
wane
away
to
the
last
minute
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
one
other
petition
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Miss
Flite
,
hear
a
rumour
that
you
be
ill
,
make
nothing
of
walk
down
here
---
twenty
mile
,
poor
soul
,
in
a
pair
of
dancing
shoe
---
to
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
heaven
's
mercy
we
be
at
home
,
or
she
would
have
walk
back
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
old
conspiracy
to
make
me
happy
!
 
<EOS>
everybody
seem
to
be
in
it
!
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
pet
,
"
say
my
guardian
,
"
if
it
would
not
be
irksome
to
you
to
admit
the
harmless
little
creature
one
afternoon
before
you
save
Boythorn
's
otherwise
devoted
house
from
demolition
,
I
believe
you
would
make
her
prouder
and
better
pleased
with
herself
than
I
---
 
though
my
eminent
name
be
Jarndyce
---
could
do
in
a
lifetime
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
he
know
there
would
be
something
in
the
simple
image
of
the
poor
afflict
creature
that
would
fall
like
a
gentle
lesson
on
my
mind
at
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
it
as
he
speak
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
tell
him
heartily
enough
<EOS>
how
ready
I
be
to
receive
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
pity
her
,
never
so
much
as
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
always
be
glad
of
my
little
power
to
soothe
her
under
her
calamity
,
but
never
,
never
,
half
so
glad
before
.
   
<EOS>
We
arrange
a
time
for
Miss
Flite
to
come
out
by
the
coach
and
share
my
early
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
when
my
guardian
leave
me
,
I
turn
my
face
away
upon
my
couch
and
pray
to
be
forgive
if
I
,
surround
by
such
blessing
,
have
magnify
to
myself
the
little
trial
that
I
have
to
undergo
.
 
<EOS>
the
childish
prayer
of
that
old
birthday
when
I
have
aspire
to
be
industrious
,
contented
,
and
true
-
hearted
and
to
do
good
to
some
one
and
win
some
love
to
myself
if
I
could
come
back
into
my
mind
with
a
reproachful
sense
of
all
the
happiness
I
have
since
enjoy
and
all
the
affectionate
heart
that
have
be
turn
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
be
weak
now
,
what
have
I
profit
by
those
mercy
?
 
<EOS>
I
repeat
the
old
childish
prayer
in
its
old
childish
word
and
find
that
its
old
peace
have
not
depart
from
it
.
   
<EOS>
My
guardian
now
come
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
week
<EOS>
or
so
more
I
could
walk
about
our
room
and
hold
long
talk
with
Ada
from
behind
the
window
-
curtain
.
 
<EOS>
yet
I
never
see
her
,
for
I
have
not
as
yet
the
courage
to
look
at
the
dear
face
,
though
I
could
have
do
so
easily
without
her
see
me
.
   
<EOS>
on
the
appoint
day

Flite

<EOS>
the
poor
little
creature
run
into
my
room
quite
forgetful
of

from
her
very
heart

the

use
of

do

she
be

<EOS>
throw
his
lordship
's
paper
into
the
fire
,
my

if
he
will
not
pay
the
jeweller
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
very
much
about
this
lady
then
,
for
I
have
an
impression
that
it
may
be
Caddy
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
my
attention
be
divert
by
my
visitor
,
who
be
cold
after
her
ride
and
look
hungry
and
who
,
our
dinner
be
bring
in
,
require
some
little
assistance
in
array
herself
with
great
satisfaction
in
a
pitiable
old
scarf
and
a
much
-
wear
and
often
-
mend
pair
of
glove
,
which
she
have
bring
down
in
a
paper
parcel
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
to
preside
,
too
,
over
the
entertainment
,
consist
of
a
dish
of
fish
,
a
roast
fowl
,
a
sweetbread
,
vegetable
,
pudding
,
and
Madeira
;
and
it
be
so
pleasant
to
see
how
she
enjoy
it
,
and
with
what
state
and
ceremony
she
do
honour
to
it
,
that
I
be
soon
think
of
nothing
else
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
have
finish
and
have
our
little
dessert
before
us
,
embellish
by
the
hand
of
my

,
who
would
yield
the
superintendence
of
everything
prepare
for
me
to
no
one
,
Miss
Flite
be
so
very
chatty
and
happy
<EOS>
that
I
think
I
would
lead
her
to
her
own
history
,
as
she
be
always
pleased
to
talk
about
herself
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
by
say
"
You
have

on

many
year

<EOS>

shortly

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
there
be
an
anxiety
even
in
her
hopefulness
that
make
me
doubtful
if
I
have
do
right
in
approach
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
would
say
no
more
about
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
My

Miss

see
she
would
go
on

I
think
it
best
to
try
to
be
serviceable
to
her

meet
the
theme
rather
than
avoid
it

<EOS>

Would
it
not

I
,
"
to

I
try
to
assure
her
that
this
be
not
so

<EOS>
She
hear
me
patiently
and
smilingly

be
ready
with
her

over

in
the
delivery

speak
in
a

strained

I

Fitz

I

let
some
one
hold
him
back

<EOS>
She
look
at
me
in
silence
for
some
moment
,
with
her
face
gradually
soften
into
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
seem
to
fear
that
she
have
be
too
gloomy
,
and
seem
also
to
lose
the
connexion
in
her
mind
<EOS>
,
she
say
politely
as
she
sip
her
glass
of
wine

"

I
be

by
the
sad

so
sadly
illustrate
in

poor
pinched
form

that
make
its

reach
another

<EOS>
and
I
do
read
all
the
noble
history
,
though
very
slowly
and
imperfectly
then
,
for
my
eye
be
so
dimmed
that
I
could
not
see
the
word
,
and
I
cry
so
much
that
I
be
many
time
oblige
to
lay
down
the
long
account
she
have
cut
out
of
the
newspaper
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
so
triumphant
ever
to
have
know
the
man
who
have
do
such
generous
and
gallant
deed
<EOS>
,
I
feel
such
glowing
exultation
in
his
renown
,
I
so
admire
and
love
what
he
have
do
,
that
I
envy
the
storm
-
wear
people
who
have
fall
at
his
foot
and
bless
him
as
their
preserver
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
myself
have
kneel
down
then
,
so
far
away
,
and
bless
him
in
my
rapture
that
he
should
be
so
truly
good
and
brave
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
that
no
one
---
mother
,
sister
,
wife

could
honour
him
more
than
I.
 
<EOS>
I
do
,
indeed
!
   
<EOS>
My
poor
little
visitor
make
me
a
present
of
the
account
,
and
when
as
the
evening
begin
to
close
in
she
rise
to
take
her
leave
,
lest
she
should
miss
the
coach
by
which
she
be
to
return
,
she
be
still
full
of
the
shipwreck
,
which
I
have
not
yet
sufficiently
compose
myself
to
understand
in
all
its
detail
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
say
she
as
she
carefully
fold
up
her
scarf
and
glove
,
"
my
brave
physician
ought
to
have
a
title
bestow
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
no
doubt
he
will
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
of
that
opinlon
?
"
   
<EOS>
that
he
well
deserve
one
,
yes
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
would
ever
have
one
,
no
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
not
,
Fitz
Jarndyce
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
rather
sharply
.
   
<EOS>
I
say
it
be
not
the
custom
in
England
to
confer
title
on
man
distinguish
by
peaceful
service
,
however
good
and
great
,
unless
occasionally
when
they
consist
of
the
accumulation
of
some
very
large
amount
of
money
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
good
gracious
,
"
say
Miss
Flite
,
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
say
that
?
<EOS>
surely
you
know
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
that
all
the
great
ornament
of
England
in
knowledge
,
imagination
,
active
humanity
,
and
improvement
of
every
sort
be
add
to
its
nobility
!
 
<EOS>
look
round
you
,
my
dear
,
and
consider
.
 
<EOS>
you
must
be
ramble
a
little
now
,
I
think
,
if
you
do
not
know
that
this
be
the
great
reason
why
title
will
always
last
in
the
land
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
she
believe
what
she
say
,
<EOS>
for
there
be
moment
when
she
be
very
mad
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
and
now
I
must
part
with
the
little
secret
<EOS>
I
have
thus
far
try
to
keep
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
think
,
sometimes
,
that
Mr
Woodcourt
love
me
and
that
if
he
have
be
rich
he
would
perhaps
have
tell
me
that
he
love
me
before
he
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
think
,
sometimes
,
that
if
he
have
do
so
,
I
should
have
be
glad
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
much
well
it
be
now
that
this
have
never
happen
!
 
<EOS>
what
should
I
have
suffer
if
I
have
have
to
write
to
him
and
tell
him
that
the
poor
face
he
have
know
as
mine
be
quite
go
from
me
and
that
I
freely
release
him
from
his
bondage
to
one
whom
he
have
never
see
!
   
<EOS>
oh
,
it
be
so
much
well
as
it
be
!
 
<EOS>
with
a
great
pang
mercifully
spare
me
,
I
could
take
back
to
my
heart
my
childish
prayer
to
be
all
he
have
so
brightly
show
himself
;
and
there
be
nothing
to
be
undo
:
no
chain
for
me
to
break
or
for
him
to
drag
;
and
I
could
go
,
please
God
,
my
lowly
way
along
the
path
of
duty
,
and
he
could
go
his
noble
way
upon
its
broad
road
;
and
though
we
be
apart
upon
the
journey
,
I
may
aspire
to
meet
him
,
unselfishly
,
innocently
,
better
far
than
he
have
think
me
when
I
find
some
favour
in
his
eye
,
at
the
journey
's
end
.

Chesney
Wold
 
<EOS>
Charley
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
set
off
alone
upon
our
expedition
into
Lincolnshire
.
 
<EOS>
My
guardian
have
make
up
his
mind
not
to
lose
sight
of
me
until
I
be
safe
in
Mr
Boythorn
's
house
,
so
he
accompany
us
,
and
we
be
two
day
upon
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
every
breath
of
air
,
and
every
scent
,
and
every
flower
and
leaf
and
blade
of
grass
,
and
every
pass
cloud
,
and
everything
in
nature
,
more
beautiful
and
wonderful
to
me
than
I
have
ever
find
it
yet
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
my
first
gain
from
my
illness
.
 
<EOS>
how
little
I
have
lose
,
when
the
wide
world
be
so
full
of
delight
for
me
.
   
<EOS>
My
guardian
intend
to
go
back
immediately
<EOS>
,
we
appoint
,
on
our
way
down
,
a
day
when
my
dear
girl
should
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
write
her
a
letter
,
of
which
he
take
charge
,
and
he
leave
us
within
half
an
hour
of
our
arrival
at
our
destination
,
on
a
delightful
evening
in
the
early
summer
-
time
.
   
<EOS>
if
a
good
fairy
have
build
the
house
for
me
with
a
wave
of
her
wand
,
and
I
have
be
a
princess
and
her
favour
god
-
child
,
I
could
not
have
be
more
consider
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
so
many
preparation
be
make
for
me
and
such
an
endearing
remembrance
be
show
of
all
my
little
taste
and
liking
that
I
could
have
sit
down
,
overcome
,
a
dozen
time
before
I
have
revisit
half
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
better
than
that
,
however
,
by
show
them
all
to
Charley
instead
.
 
<EOS>
Charley
's
delight
calm
mine
;
and
after
we
have
have
a
walk
in
the
garden
,
and
Charley
have
exhaust
her
whole
vocabulary
of
admire
expression
,
I
be
as
tranquilly
happy
as
I
ought
to
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
comfort
to
be
able
to
say
to
myself
after
tea
,
"
esther
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
I
think
you
be
quite
sensible
enough
to
sit
down
now
and
write
a
note
of
thank
to
your
host
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
have
leave
a
note
of
welcome
for
me
,
as
sunny
as
his
own
face
,
and
have
confide
his
bird
to
my
care
,
which
I
know
to
be
his
high
mark
of
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
I
write
a
little
note
to
him
in
London
,
tell
him
how
all
his
favourite
plant
and
tree
be
look
,
and
how
the
most
astonishing
of
bird
have
chirp
the
honour
of
the
house
to
me
in
the
most
hospitable
manner
,
and
how
,
after
singe
on
my
shoulder
,
to
the
inconceivable
rapture
of
my
little
maid
,
he
be
then
at
roost
in
the
usual
corner
of
his
cage
,
but
whether
dream
or
no
<EOS>
I
could
not
report
.
 
<EOS>
My
note
finish
and
send
off
to
the
post
,
I
make
myself
very
busy
in
unpack
and
arranging
;
and
I
send
Charley
to
bed
in
good
time
and
tell
her
I
should
want
her
no
more
that
night
.
   
<EOS>
for
I
have
not
yet
look
in
the
glass
and
have
never
ask
to
have
my
own
restore
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
this
to
be
a
weakness
which
must
be
overcome
,
but
I
have
always
say
to
myself
that
I
would
begin
afresh
when
I
get
to
where
I
now
be
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
I
have
want
to
be
alone
,
and
therefore
I
say
,
now
alone
,
in
my
own
room
,
"
esther
,
if
you
be
to
be
happy
,
if
you
be
to
have
any
right
to
pray
to
be
true
-
hearted
,
you
must
keep
your
word
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
quite
resolve
to
keep
it
,
but
I
sit
down
for
a
little
while
first
to
reflect
upon
all
my
blessing
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
say
my
prayer
and
think
a
little
more
.
   
<EOS>
My
hair
have
not
be
cut
off
,
though
it
have
be
in
danger
more
than
once
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
long
and
thick
.
 
<EOS>
I
let
it
down
,
and
shake
it
out
,
and
go
up
to
the
glass
upon
the
dressing
-
table
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
muslin
curtain
draw
across
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
draw
it
back
and
stand
for
a
moment
look
through
such
a
veil
of
my
own
hair
that
I
could
see
nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
put
my
hair
aside
and
look
at
the
reflection
in
the
mirror
,
encourage
by
see
how
placidly
it
look
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
change
---
oh
,
very
,
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
my
face
be
so
strange
to
me
that
I
think
I
should
have
put
my
hand
before
it
and
start
back
but
for
the
encouragement
I
have
mention
.
 
<EOS>
very
soon
it
become
more
familiar
,
and
then
I
know
the
extent
of
the
alteration
in
it
better
than
I
have
do
at
first
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
like
what
I
have
expect
,
but
I
have
expect
nothing
definite
,
and
I
dare
say
anything
definite
would
have
surprise
me
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
never
be
a
beauty
and
have
never
think
myself
one
,
but
I
have
be
very
different
from
this
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
all
go
now
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
be
so
good
to
me
that
I
could
let
it
go
with
a
few
not
bitter
tear
and
could
stand
there
arrange
my
hair
for
the
night
quite
thankfully
.
   
<EOS>
one
thing
trouble
me
,
and
I
consider
it
for
a
long
time
before
I
go
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
keep
Mr
Woodcourt
's
flower
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
be
wither
I
have
dry
them
and
put
them
in
a
book
that
I
be
fond
of
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
know
this
,
not
even
Ada
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
doubtful
whether
I
have
a
right
to
preserve
what
he
have
send
to
one
so
different
---
whether
it
be
generous
towards
him
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
to
be
generous
to
him
,
even
in
the
secret
depth
of
my
heart
,
which
he
would
never
know
,
because
I
could
have
love
him
---
could
have
be
devote
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
come
to
the
conclusion
that
I
may
keep
them
if
I
treasure
them
only
as
a
remembrance
of
what
be
irrevocably
past
and
go
,
never
to
be
look
back
on
any
more
,
in
any
other
light
.
<EOS>
I
hope
this
may
not
seem
trivial
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
in
earnest
.
   
<EOS>
I
take
care
to
be
up
early
in
the
morning
and
to
be
before
the
glass
when
Charley
come
in
on
tiptoe
.
   
<EOS>
"
dear
,
dear
,
miss
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Charley
,
start
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
that
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Charley
,
"
say
I
,
quietly
put
up
my
hair
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
I
be
very
well
indeed
,
and
very
happy
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
see
it
be
a
weight
off
Charley
's
mind
,
but
it
be
a
great
weight
off
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
bad
now
and
be
compose
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
not
conceal
,
as
I
go
on
,
the
weakness
I
could
not
quite
conquer
,
but
they
always
pass
from
me
soon
and
the
happy
frame
of
mind
stay
by
me
faithfully
.
   
<EOS>
wish
to
be
fully
re
-
establish
in
my
strength
and
my
good
spirit
before
Ada
come
,
I
now
lay
down
a
little
series
of
plan
with
Charley
for
be
in
the
fresh
air
all
day
long
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
to
be
out
before
breakfast
,
and
be
to
dine
early
,
and
be
to
be
out
again
before
and
after
dinner
,
and
be
to
talk
in
the
garden
after
tea
,
and
be
to
go
to
rest
betime
,
and
be
to
climb
every
hill
and
explore
every
road
,
lane
,
and
field
in
the
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
restorative
and
strengthen
delicacy
,
Mr
Boythorn
's
good
housekeeper
be
for
ever
trot
about
with
something
to
eat
or
drink
in
her
hand
;
I
could
not
even
be
hear
of
as
rest
in
the
park
<EOS>
but
she
would
come
<EOS>
trot
after
me
with
a
basket
,
her
cheerful
face
shine
with
a
lecture
on
the
importance
of
frequent
nourishment
.
 
<EOS>
then
there
be
a
pony
expressly
for
my
riding
,
a
chubby
pony
with
a
short
neck
and
a
mane
all
over
his
eye
who
could
canter
---
when
he
would
---
so
easily
and
quietly
that
he
be
a
treasure
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
very
few
day
he
would
come
to
me
in
the
paddock
when
I
call
him
,
and
eat
out
of
my
hand
,
and
follow
me
about
.
 
<EOS>
We
arrive
at
such
a
capital
understanding
that
when
he
be
jog
with
me
lazily
,
and
rather
obstinately
,
down
some
shady
lane
,
if
I
pat
his
neck
and
say
,
"
Stubbs
,
I
be
surprised
you
do
not
canter
when
you
know
how
much
I
like
it
;
and
I
think
you
may
oblige
me
,
for
you
be
only
get
stupid
and
go
to
sleep
,
"
he
would
give
his
head
a
comical
shake
or
two
and
set
off
directly
,
while
Charley
would
stand
still
and
laugh
with
such
enjoyment
that
her
laughter
be
like
music
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
who
have
give
Stubbs
his
name
,
but
it
seem
to
belong
to
him
as
naturally
as
his
rough
coat
.
 
<EOS>
once
we
put
him
in
a
little
chaise
and
drive
him
triumphantly
through
the
green
lane
for
five
mile
;
but
<EOS>
all
at
once
,
as
we
be
extoll
him
to
the
sky
,
he
seem
to
take
it
ill
that
he
should
have
be
accompany
so
far
by
the
circle
of
tantalize
little
gnat
that
have
be
hover
round
and
round
his
ear
the
whole
way
without
appear
to
advance
an
inch
,
and
stop
to
think
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
come
to
the
decision
that
it
be
not
to
be
bear
,
for
he
steadily
refuse
to
move
until
I
give
the
rein
to
Charley
and
get
out
and
walk
,
when
he
follow
me
with
a
sturdy
sort
of
good
humour
,
put
his
head
under
my
arm
and
rub
his
ear
against
my
sleeve
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
for
me
to
say
,
"
now
,
Stubbs
,
I
feel
quite
sure
from
what
I
know
of
you
that
you
will
go
on
if
I
ride
a
little
while
,
"
for
the
moment
I
leave
him
,
he
stand
stock
still
again
.
 
<EOS>
consequently
I
be
oblige
to
lead
the
way
,
as
before
;
and
in
this
order
we
return
home
,
to
the
great
delight
of
the
village
.
   
<EOS>
Charley
<EOS>
and
I
have
reason
to
call
it
the
most
friendly
of
village
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
,
for
in
a
week
's
time
the
people
be
so
glad
to
see
us
go
by
,
though
ever
so
frequently
in
the
course
of
a
day
,
that
there
be
face
of
greeting
in
every
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
know
many
of
the
grown
people
before
and
almost
all
the
child
,
but
now
the
very
steeple
begin
to
wear
a
familiar
and
affectionate
look
.
 
<EOS>
among
my
new
friend
be
an
old
old
woman
who
live
in
such
a
little
thatched
and
whitewash
dwelling
that
when
the
outside
shutter
be
turn
up
on
its
hinge
,
it
shut
up
the
whole
house
-
front
.
 
<EOS>
this
old
lady
have
a
grandson
who
be
a
sailor
,
and
I
write
a
letter
to
him
for
her
and
draw
at
the
top
of
it
the
chimney
-
corner
in
which
she
have
bring
him
up
and
where
his
old
stool
yet
occupy
its
old
place
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
consider
by
the
whole
village
the
most
wonderful
achievement
in
the
world
,
but
when
an
answer
come
back
all
the
way
from
Plymouth
,
in
which
he
mention
that
he
be
go
to
take
the
picture
all
the
way
to
America
,
and
from
America
would
write
again
,
I
get
all
the
credit
that
ought
to
have
be
give
to
the
post
-
office
and
be
invest
with
the
merit
of
the
whole
system
.
   
<EOS>
thus
,
what
with
be
so
much
in
the
air
,
play
with
so
many
child
,
gossip
with
so
many
people
,
sit
on
invitation
in
so
many
cottage
,
go
on
with
Charley
's
education
,
and
write
long
letter
to
Ada
every
day
,
I
have
scarcely
any
time
to
think
about
that
little
loss
of
mine
and
be
almost
always
cheerful
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
do
think
of
it
at
odd
moment
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
I
have
only
to
be
busy
and
forget
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
it
more
than
I
have
hope
I
should
once
when
a
child
say
,
"
Mother
,
why
be
the
lady
not
a
pretty
lady
now
like
she
use
to
be
?
"
 
<EOS>
but
when
I
find
the
child
be
not
less
fond
of
me
,
and
draw
its
soft
hand
over
my
face
with
a
kind
of
pity
protection
in
its
touch
,
that
soon
set
me
up
again
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
many
little
occurrence
which
suggest
to
me
,
with
great
consolation
,
how
natural
it
be
to
gentle
heart
to
be
considerate
and
delicate
towards
any
inferiority
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
these
particularly
touch
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
happen
to
stroll
into
the
little
church
when
a
marriage
be
just
conclude
,
and
the
young
couple
have
to
sign
the
register
.
   
<EOS>
the
bridegroom
,
to
whom
the
pen
be
hand
first
,
make
a
rude
cross
for
his
mark
;
the
bride
,
who
come
next
,
do
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
I
have
know
the
bride
when
I
be
last
there
,
not
only
as
the
pretty
girl
in
the
place
,
but
as
have
quite
distinguish
herself
in
the
school
,
and
I
could
not
help
look
at
her
with
some
surprise
.
<EOS>
She
come
aside
and
whisper
to
me
,
while
tear
of
honest
love
and
admiration
stand
in
her
bright
eye
,
"
He
be
a
dear
good
fellow
,
miss
;
but
he
can
not
write
yet
---
he
be
go
to
learn
of
me
---
and
I
would
not
shame
him
for
the
world
!
"
 
<EOS>
why
,
what
have
I
to
fear
,
I
think
,
when
there
be
this
nobility
in
the
soul
of
a
labour
man
's
daughter
!
   
<EOS>
the
air
blow
as
freshly
and
revivingly
upon
me
as
it
have
ever
blow
,
and
the
healthy
colour
come
into
my
new
face
as
it
have
come
into
my
old
one
.
 
<EOS>
Charley
be
wonderful
to
see
,
she
be
so
radiant
and
so
rosy
;
and
we
both
enjoy
the
whole
day
and
sleep
soundly
the
whole
night
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
favourite
spot
of
mine
in
the
park
-
wood
of
Chesney
Wold
where
a
seat
have
be
erect
command
a
lovely
view
.
 
<EOS>
the
wood
have
be
clear
and
open
to
improve
this
point
of
sight
,
and
the
bright
sunny
landscape
beyond
be
so
beautiful
that
I
rest
there
at
least
once
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
a
picturesque
part
of
the
Hall
,
call
the
Ghost
's
walk
,
be
see
to
advantage
from
this
high
ground
;
and
the
startling
name
,
and
the
old
legend
in
the
Dedlock
family
which
I
have
hear
from
Mr
Boythorn
account
for
it
,
mingle
with
the
view
and
give
it
something
of
a
mysterious
interest
in
addition
to
its
real
charm
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
bank
here
,
too
,
which
be
a
famous
one
for
violet
;
and
as
it
be
a
daily
delight
of
Charley
's
to
gather
wild
flower
,
she
take
as
much
to
the
spot
as
I
do
.
   
<EOS>
It
would
be
idle
to
inquire
now
why
I
never
go
close
to
the
house
or
never
go
inside
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
family
be
not
there
,
I
have
hear
on
my
arrival
,
and
be
not
expect
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
far
from
be
incurious
or
uninterested
about
the
building
;
on
the
contrary
,
I
often
sit
in
this
place
wonder
how
the
room
range
and
whether
any
echo
like
a
footstep
really
do
resound
at
time
,
as
the
story
say
,
upon
the
lonely
Ghost
's
Walk
.
 
<EOS>
the
indefinable
feeling
with
which
Lady
Dedlock
have
impress
me
may
have
have
some
influence
in
keep
me
from
the
house
even
when
she
be
absent
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
sure
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
and
figure
be
associate
with
it
,
naturally
;
but
I
can
not
say
that
they
repel
me
from
it
,
though
something
do
.
 
<EOS>
for
whatever
reason
or
no
reason
,
I
have
never
once
go
near
it
,
down
to
the
day
at
which
my
story
now
arrive
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
rest
at
my
favourite
point
after
a
long
ramble
,
and
Charley
be
gather
violet
at
a
little
distance
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
look
at
the
Ghost
's
walk
lie
in
a
deep
shade
of
masonry
afar
off
and
picture
to
myself
the
female
shape
that
be
say
to
haunt
it
when
I
become
aware
of
a
figure
approach
through
the
wood
.
 
<EOS>
the
perspective
be
so
long
and
so
darken
by
leave
,
and
the
shadow
of
the
branch
on
the
ground
make
it
so
much
more
intricate
to
the
eye
,
that
at
first
I
could
not
discern
what
figure
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
by
little
and
little
it
reveal
itself
to
be
a
woman
's
---
a
lady
's
---
Lady
Dedlock
's
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
alone
and
come
to
where
I
sit
with
a
much
quick
step
<EOS>
,
I
observe
to
my
surprise
,
than
be
usual
with
her
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
flutter
by
her
be
unexpectedly
so
near
<EOS>
(
she
be
almost
within
speak
distance
before
I
know
her
)
and
would
have
rise
to
continue
my
walk
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
render
motionless
.
<EOS>
not
so
much
by
her
hurried
gesture
of
entreaty
,
not
so
much
by
her
quick
advance
and
outstretche
hand
,
not
so
much
by
the
great
change
in
her
manner
and
the
absence
of
her
haughty
self
-
restraint
,
as
by
a
something
in
her
face
that
I
have
pine
for
and
dream
of
when
I
be
a
little
child
,
something
I
have
never
see
in
any
face
,
something
I
have
never
see
in
hers
before
.
   
<EOS>
a
dread
and
faintness
fall
upon
me
,
and
I
call
to
Charley
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Dedlock
stop
upon
the
instant
and
change
back
almost
to
what
I
have
know
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Summerson
,
I
be
afraid
I
have
startle
you
,
"
she
say
,
now
advance
slowly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
scarcely
be
strong
yet
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
be
very
ill
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
much
concern
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
no
more
have
remove
my
eye
from
her
pale
face
than
I
could
have
stir
from
the
bench
on
which
I
sit
.
 
<EOS>
She
give
me
her
hand
,
and
its
deadly
coldness
,
so
at
variance
with
the
enforced
composure
of
her
feature
,
deepen
the
fascination
that
overpower
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
what
be
in
my
whirl

Lady

down
on

<EOS>
I
can
not

the
state
of
my

be
when
I
see
in
her
hand
my
handkerchief
with
which
I
have
cover
the
dead
baby

<EOS>
I
look
at
her

but
I
could
not

her

,
I
could
not

I
could
not

my
breath

weep
over

compassionate
me

call

down
on

my

unhappy
mother

<EOS>
---
when
I
see
her
at
my
foot
on
the
bare
earth
in
her
great
agony
of
mind
,
I
feel
,
through
all
my
tumult
of
emotion
,
a
burst
of
gratitude
to
the
providence
of
God
that
I
be
so
change
as
that
I
never
could
disgrace
her
by
any
trace
of
likeness

as
that
nobody
could
ever
now
look
at
me
and
look
at
her
and
remotely
think
of
any
near
tie
between
us
.
   
<EOS>
I
raise
my
mother
up
,
pray
and
beseech
her
not
to
stoop
before
me
in
such
affliction
and
humiliation
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
so
in
broken
,
incoherent
word

for
besides
the
trouble
I
be
in
,
it
frighten
me
to
see
her
at
my
foot

<EOS>
I
tell
her

I
try
to
tell
her

that
if
it
be
for
me

her
child

under
any
circumstance
to
take
upon
me
to
forgive
her

I
do

I
tell
her

my

natural
love

nothing
in

change

that

rest

take
her
to
account

give
me
life

that
my
duty

I

she
hold
me
in
hers

and
among
the
still
wood
in
the
silence
of
the
summer
day
there
seem
to
be
nothing

our
two
troubled
mind
that
be

"

my

it
be
far
too
late

I
must
travel
my

road
alone

where
it
will

from
day

day

sometimes
from
hour

hour

this
be
the

have
bring
upon

bear
it

hide
it

<EOS>
even
in
the
thinking
of
her
endurance
,
she
draw
her
habitual
air
of
proud
indifference
about
her
like
a
veil
,
though
she
soon
cast
it
off
again

<EOS>
"
I

I
have
a

wretched
and
dishonour
creature
that
I
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
these
word
she
utter
with
a
suppressed
cry
of
despair
,
more
terrible
in
its
sound
than
any
shriek
.
 
<EOS>
cover
her
face
with
her
hand
,
she
shrink
down
in
my
embrace
as
if
she
be
unwilling
that
I
should
touch
her
;
nor
could
I
,
by
my
utmost
persuasion
or
by
any
endearment
I
could
use
,
prevail
upon
her
to
rise
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
,
no
,
no
,
no
,
she
could
only
speak
to
me
so
<EOS>
;
she
must
be
proud
and
disdainful
everywhere
else
;
she
would
be
humble
and
ashamed
there
,
in
the
only
natural
moment
of
her
life
.
   
<EOS>
My
unhappy
mother
tell
me
that
in
my
illness
she
have
be
nearly
frantic
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
but
then
know
that
her
child
be
live
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
have
suspect
me
to
be
that
child
before
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
follow
me
down
here
to
speak
to
me
but
once
in
all
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
We
never
could
associate
,
never
could
communicate
,
never
probably
from
that
time
forth
could
interchange
another
word
on
earth
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
into
my
hand
a
letter
she
have
write
for
my
reading
only
and
say
when
I
have
read
it
and
destroy
it
---
but
not
so
much
for
her
sake
,
since
she
ask
nothing
,
as
for
her
husband
's
and
my
own
---
I
must
evermore
consider
her
as
dead
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
could
believe
that
she
love
me
,
in
this
agony
in
which
I
see
her
,
with
a
mother
's
love
,
she
ask
me
to
do
that
,
for
then
I
may
think
of
her
with
a
great
pity
,
imagine
what
she
suffer
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
put
herself
beyond
all
hope

beyond
all
help

<EOS>
whether
she
preserve
her
secret
until
death
or
it
come
to
be
discover
and
she
bring
dishonour
and
disgrace
upon
the
name
she
have
take
,
it
be
her
solitary
struggle
always
;
and
no
affection
could
come
near
her
,
and
no
human
creature
could
render
her
any
aid

be
the
secret
safe

far

We
hold
one
another

she
be
so
firm

take

away

with

there

release
them

go
from
me
into
the
wood
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
alone
,
and
calm
and
quiet
below
me
in
the
sun
and
shade
lie
the
old
house
,
with
its
terrace
and
turret
,
on
which
there
have
seem
to
me
to
be
such
complete
repose
when
I
first
see
it
,
but
which
now
look
like
the
obdurate

unpitying
watcher
of
my
mother
's
misery

stun
as
I
be
,
as
weak

helpless
at
first
as
I
have
ever
be
in
my
sick
chamber
,
the
necessity
of
guard
against
the
danger
of
discovery
,

even
of
the
remote
suspicion

do
me
service

<EOS>
I
take
such
precaution
as
I
could
to
hide
from
Charley
that
I
have
be
cry
,
and
I
constrain
myself
to
think
of
every
sacred
obligation
that
there
be
upon
me
to
be
careful
and
collect
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
little
while
before
I
could
succeed

could
even
restrain
burst
of
grief

after
an
hour
or
so
I
be
well
and
feel
that
I
may
return
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
home
very
slowly
and
tell
Charley
,
whom
I
find
at
the
gate
look
for
me
,
that
I
have
be
tempt
to
extend
my
walk
after
Lady
Dedlock
have
leave
me
and
that
I
be
over
-
tired
and
would
lie
down
.
 
<EOS>
safe
in
my
own
room
,
I
read
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
clearly
derive
from
it

and
that
be
much
then

that
I
have
not

be
lay
aside

dead

have
in

stern
sense

duty

with
no

willingness

rear
me
in
rigid
secrecy

have
never

beheld
my
mother

within
a

so
strangely

hold
my

back
I

never

to

when

be
all
then
.
   
<EOS>
what
more
the
letter
tell
me
need
not
to
be
repeat
here
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
its
own
time
and
place
in
my
story
.
   
<EOS>
My
first
care
be
to
burn
what
my
mother
have
write
and
to
consume
even
its
ashe
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
it
may
not
appear
very
unnatural
or
bad
in
me
that
I
then
become
heavily
sorrowful
to
think
I
have
ever
be
rear
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
feel
as
if
I
know
it
would
have
be
well
and
happy
for
many
people
if
indeed
I
have
never
breathe
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
have
a
terror
of
myself
as
the
danger
and
the
possible
disgrace
of
my
own
mother
and
of
a
proud
family
name
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
be
so
confused
and
shake
as
to
be
possess
by
a
belief
that
it
be
right
and
have
be
intend
that
I
should
die
in
my
birth
,
and
that
it
be
wrong
and
not
intend
that
I
should
be
then
alive
.
   
<EOS>
these
be
the
real
feeling
that
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
I
fall
asleep
<EOS>
wear
out
,
and
when
I
awake
I
cry
afresh
to
think
that
I
be
back
in
the
world
with
my
load
of
trouble
for
other
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
more
than
ever
frighten
of
myself
,
think
anew
of
her
against
whom
I
be
a
witness
,
of
the
owner
of
Chesney
Wold
,
of
the
new
and
terrible
meaning
of
the
old
word
now
moan
in
my
ear
like
a
surge
upon
the
shore
,
"
<EOS>
Your
mother
,
Esther
,
be
your
disgrace
,
and
you
be
hers
.
 
<EOS>
the
time
will
come
---
and
soon
enough
---
when
you
will
understand
this
well
,
and
will
feel
it
too
,
as
no
one
save
a
woman
can
.
"
 
<EOS>
with
them
,
those
other
word
return
,
"
pray
daily
that
the
sin
of
other
be
not
visit
upon
your
head
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
disentangle
all
that
be
about
me
,
and
I
feel
as
if
the
blame
and
the
shame
be
all
in
me
,
and
the
visitation
have
come
down
.
   
<EOS>
the
day
wane
into
a
gloomy
evening
,
overcast
and
sad
,
and
I
still
contend
with
the
same
distress
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
out
alone
,
and
after
walk
a
little
in
the
park
,
watch
the
dark
shade
fall
on
the
tree
and
the
fitful
flight
of
the
bat
,
which
sometimes
almost
touch
me
,
be
attract
to
the
house
for
the
first
time
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
I
may
not
have
go
near
it
if
I
have
be
in
a
strong
frame
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
I
take
the
path
that
lead
close
by
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
dare
to
linger
or
to
look
up
,
but
I
pass
before
the
terrace
garden
with
its
fragrant
odour
,
and
its
broad
walk
,
and
its
well
-
keep
bed
and
smooth
turf
;
and
I
see
how
beautiful
and
grave
<EOS>
it
be
,
and
how
the
old
stone
balustrade
and
parapet
,
and
wide
flight
of
shallow
step
,
be
seam
by
time
and
weather
;
and
how
the
train
moss
and
ivy
grow
about
them
,
and
around
the
old
stone
pedestal
of
the
sun
-
dial
;
and
I
hear
the
fountain
fall
.
<EOS>
then
the
way
go
by
long
line
of
dark
window
diversify
by
turrete
tower
and
porch
of
eccentric
shape
,
where
old
stone
lion
and
grotesque
monster
bristle
outside
den
of
shadow
and
snarl
at
the
evening
gloom
over
the
escutcheon
they
hold
in
their
grip
.
 
<EOS>
thence
<EOS>
the
path
wind
underneath
a
gateway
,
and
through
a
court
-
yard
where
the
principal
entrance
be
(
I
hurry
quickly
on
)
,
and
by
the
stable
where
none
but
deep
voice
seem
to
be
,
whether
in
the
murmuring
of
the
wind
through
the
strong
mass
of
ivy
hold
to
a
high
red
wall
,
or
in
the
low
complaining
of
the
weathercock
,
or
in
the
barking
of
the
dog
,
or
in
the
slow
striking
of
a
clock
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
encounter
presently
a
sweet
smell
of
lime
,
whose
rustling
I
could
hear
,
I
turn
with
the
turning
of
the
path
to
the
south
front
,
and
there
above
me
be
the
balustrade
of
the
Ghost
's
walk
and
one
light
window
that
may
be
my
mother
's
.
   
<EOS>
the
way
be
pave
here
,
like
the
terrace
overhead
,
and
my
footstep
from
be
noiseless
make
an
echoing
sound
upon
the
flag
.
<EOS>
stop
to
look
at
nothing
,
but
see
all
I
do
see
as
I
go
,
I
be
pass
quickly
on
,
and
in
a
few
moment
should
have
pass
the
light
window
,
<EOS>
when
my
echo
footstep
bring
it
suddenly
into
my
mind
that
there
be
a
dreadful
truth
in
the
legend
of
the
Ghost
's
walk
,
that
it
be
I
who
be
to
bring
calamity
upon
the
stately
house
and
that
my
warning
foot
be
haunt
it
even
then
.
<EOS>
seize
with
an
augmented
terror
of
myself
which
turn
me
cold
,
I
run
from
myself
and
everything
,
retrace
the
way
by
which
I
have
come
,
and
never
pause
until
I
have
gain
the
lodge
-
gate
,
and
the
park
lie
sullen
and
black
behind
me
.
   
<EOS>
not
before
I
be
alone
in
my
own
room
for
the
night
and
have
again
be
deject
and
unhappy
there
<EOS>
do
I
begin
to
know
how
wrong
and
thankless
<EOS>
this
state
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
from
my
darling
who
be
come
on
the
morrow
,
I
find
a
joyful
letter
,
full
of
such
loving
anticipation
that
I
must
have
be
of
marble
if
it
have
not
move
me
;
from
my
guardian
,
too
,
I
find
another
letter
,
ask
me
to
tell
Dame
Durden
,
if
I
should
see
that
little
woman
anywhere
,
that
they
have
mope
most
pitiably
without
her
,
that
the
housekeeping
be
go
to
rack
and
ruin
,
that
nobody
else
could
manage
the
key
,
and
that
everybody
in
and
about
the
house
declare
it
be
not
the
same
house
and
be
become
rebellious
for
her
return
.
 
<EOS>
two
such
letter
together
make
me
think
how
far
beyond
my
desert
<EOS>
I
be
beloved
and
how
happy
I
ought
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
that
make
me
think
of
all
my
past
life
;
and
that
bring
me
,
as
it
ought
to
have
do
before
,
into
a
well
condition
.
   
<EOS>
for
I
see
very
well
that
I
could
not
have
be
intend
to
die
,
or
I
should
never
have
live
;
not
to
say
should
never
have
be
reserve
for
such
a
happy
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
very
well
how
many
thing
have
work
together
for
my
welfare
,
and
that
if
the
sin
of
the
father
be
sometimes
visit
upon
the
child
,
the
phrase
do
not
mean
what
I
have
in
the
morning
fear
it
mean
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
be
as
innocent
of
my
birth
as
a
queen
of
hers
and
that
before
my
Heavenly
Father
I
should
not
be
punish
for
birth
nor
a
queen
reward
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
have
experience
,
in
the
shock
of
that
very
day
,
that
I
could
,
even
thus
soon
,
find
comfort
reconcilement
to
the
change
that
have
fall
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
renew
my
resolution
and
pray
to
be
strengthen
in
them
,
pour
out
my
heart
for
myself
and
for
my
unhappy
mother
and
feeling
that
the
darkness
of
the
morning
be
pass
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
upon
my
sleep
;
and
when
the
next
day
's
light
awake
me
,
it
be
go
.
   
<EOS>
My
dear
girl
be
to
arrive
at
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
how
to
help
myself
through
the
intermediate
time
well
than
by
take
a
long
walk
along
the
road
by
which
she
be
to
come
,
I
do
not
know
;
so
Charley
and
I
and
Stubbs
---
stubb
saddle
,
for
we
never
drive
him
after
the
one
great
occasion
---
make
a
long
expedition
along
that
road
and
back
.
 
<EOS>
on
our
return
,
we
hold
a
great
review
of
the
house
and
garden
and
see
that
everything
be
in
its
prettiest
condition
,
and
have
the
bird
out
ready
as
an
important
part
of
the
establishment
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
more
than
two
full
hour
yet
to
elapse
before
she
could
come
,
and
in
that
interval
,
which
seem
a
long
one
,
I
must
confess
I
be
nervously
anxious
about
my
alter
look
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
my
darling
so
well
that
I
be
more
concerned
for
their
effect
on
her
than
on
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
in
this
slight
distress
because
I
at
all
repine
<EOS>
---
I
be
quite
certain
I
do
not
,
that
day
---
but
,
I
think
,
would
she
be
wholly
prepared
?
 
<EOS>
when
she
first
see
me
,
may
she
not
be
a
little
shocked
and
disappointed
?
 
<EOS>
may
it
not
prove
a
little
bad
than
she
expect
?
 
<EOS>
may
she
not
look
for
her
old
Esther
and
not
find
her
?
 
<EOS>
may
she
not
have
to
grow
use
to
me
and
to
begin
all
over
again
?
   
<EOS>
I
know
the
various
expression
of
my
sweet
girl
's
face
so
well
,
and
it
be
such
an
honest
face
in
its
loveliness
,
that
I
be
sure
beforehand
<EOS>
she
could
not
hide
that
first
look
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
consider
whether
,
if
it
should
signify
any
one
of
these
meaning
,
which
be
so
very
likely
,
could
I
quite
answer
for
myself
?
   
<EOS>
well
,
I
think
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
after
last
night
,
I
think
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
but
to
wait
and
wait
,
and
expect
and
expect
,
and
think
and
think
,
be
such
bad
preparation
that
I
resolve
to
go
along
the
road
again
and
meet
her
.
   
<EOS>
so
I
say
to
Charley
,
"
Charley
,
I
will
go
by
myself
and
walk
along
the
road
until
she
come
.
"
 
<EOS>
Charley
highly
approve
of
anything
that
please
me
<EOS>
,
I
go
and
leave
her
at
home
.
   
<EOS>
but
before
I
get
to
the
second
milestone
,
I
have
be
in
so
many
palpitation
from
see
dust
in
the
distance
(
though
I
know
it
be
not
,
and
could
not
,
be
the
coach
yet
)
<EOS>
that
I
resolve
to
turn
back
and
go
home
again
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
have
turn
,
I
be
in
such
fear
of
the
coach
come
up
behind
me
(
though
I
still
know
that
it
neither
would
,
nor
could
,
do
any
such
thing
)
<EOS>
that
I
run
the
great
part
of
the
way
to
avoid
be
overtake
.
   
<EOS>
then
,
I
consider
,
when
I
have
get
safe
back
again
,
this
be
a
nice
thing
to
have
do
!
 
<EOS>
now
I
be
hot
and
have
make
the
bad
of
it
instead
of
the
good
.
   
<EOS>
at
last
,
when
I
believe
there
be
at
least
a
quarter
of
an
hour
more
yet
,
Charley
all
at
once
cry
out
to
me
as
I
be
tremble
in
the
garden
,
"
here
she
come
,
miss
!
 
<EOS>
here
she
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
do
it
,
but
I
run
upstairs
into
my
room
and
hide
myself
behind
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
there
I
stand
tremble
,
even
when
I
hear
my
darling
call
as
she
come
upstairs
,
"
esther
,
my
dear
,
my
love
,
where
be
you
?
 
<EOS>
little
woman
,
dear
Dame
Durden
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
run
in
,
and
be
run
out
again
when
she
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
ah
,
my
angel
girl
!
 
<EOS>
the
old
dear
look
,
all
love
,
all
fondness
,
all
affection
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
else
in
it
---
<EOS>
no
,
nothing
,
nothing
!
   
<EOS>
oh
,
how
happy
I
be
,
down
upon
the
floor
,
with
my
sweet
beautiful
girl
down
upon
the
floor
too
,
hold
my
scar
face
to
her
lovely
cheek
,
bathe
it
with
tear
and
kiss
,
rock
me
to
and
fro
like
a
child
,
call
me
by
every
tender
name
that
she
could
think
of
,
and
press
me
to
her
faithful
heart

Chapter

<EOS>
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
 
<EOS>
if
the
secret
I
have
to
keep
have
be
mine
,
I
must
have
confide
it
to
Ada
before
we
have
be
long
together
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
mine
,
and
I
do
not
feel
that
I
have
a
right
to
tell
it
,
even
to
my
guardian
,
unless
some
great
emergency
arise
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
weight
to
bear
alone
;
still
my
present
duty
appear
to
be
plain
,
and
bl
in
the
attachment
of
my
dear
,
I
do
not
want
an
impulse
and
encouragement
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
though
often
when
she
be
asleep
and
all
be
quiet
,
the
remembrance
of
my
mother
keep
me
wake
and
make
the
night
sorrowful
,
I
do
not
yield
to
it
at
another
time
;
and
Ada
find
me
what
I
use
to
be
---
except
,
of
course
,
in
that
particular
of
which
I
have
say
enough
and
which
I
have
no
intention
of
mention
any
more
just
now
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
   
<EOS>
the
difficulty
that
I
feel
in
be
quite
compose
that
first
evening
when
Ada
ask
me
,
over
our
work
,
if
the
family
be
at
the
house
,
and
when
I
be
oblige
to
answer
<EOS>
yes
,
I
believe
so
,
for
Lady
Dedlock
have
speak
to
me
in
the
wood
the
day
before
yesterday
,
be
great
.
 
<EOS>
Greater
<EOS>
still
when
Ada
ask
me
what
she
have
say
,
and
when
I
reply
that
she
have
be
kind
and
interested
,
and
when
Ada
,
while
admit
her
beauty
and
elegance
,
remark
upon
her
proud
manner
and
her
imperious
chilling
air
.
 
<EOS>
but
Charley
help
me
through
,
unconsciously
,
by
tell
us
that
Lady
Dedlock
have
only
stay
at
the
house
two
night
on
her
way
from
London
to
visit
at
some
other
great
house
in
the
next
county
and
that
she
have
leave
early
on
the
morning
after
we
have
see
her
at
our
view
,
as
we
call
it
.
 
<EOS>
Charley
verify
the
adage
about
little
pitcher
,
I
be
sure
,
for
she
hear
of
more
saying
and
doing
in
a
day
than
would
have
come
to
my
ear
in
a
month
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
to
stay
a
month
at
Mr
Boythorn

My
pet
have
scarcely
be
there
a
bright
week
,
as
I
recollect
the
time
,
when
one
evening
after
we
have
finish
help
the
gardener

I
bid
Charley

have
put

along
the
sanded
passage

<EOS>
I
know
Mr

very
well
by
sight
,
from
his
often

a
pleasant

looking

stoutish

snuff
the

back
away
a

<EOS>
the
door

I
hear
some
voice
,
familiar
in
my
ear
<EOS>
I
think
,
which
stop
.
 
<EOS>
a
quick
light
step
approach
the
room

I

in

I
could
scarcely

Richard
just
as
heartily
as
before

<EOS>
I
put
up
my
veil
altogether
,
and
lay
my
hand
on
Richard
's
sleeve
and
look
in
his
face
,
tell
him
how
much
I
thank
him
for
his
kind
welcome
and
<EOS>
how
greatly
I
rejoice
to
see
him
,
the
more
so
because
of
the
determination
I
have
make
in
my
illness
,
which
I
now
convey
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"

course
I
do

<EOS>

I
may
say
at

I
be

this

it

I
ask

any

know
of

come
down
together

He
answer
,
no

nobody

<EOS>
He
have
be

have
tell

directly

so
he
have
bring
him

he
be
worth

not

thrice
his

Richard

"
He

such
a

<EOS>
no

fresh

<EOS>
I
certainly
do
not
see
the
proof
of
Mr
Skimpole
's
worldliness
in
his
have
his
expense
pay
by
Richard

I
make
no

indeed

He

shed
delicious
tear

sympathy
at
interval
for
six
week

have
never
be
so
happy

in

begin
to
understand
the
mixture
of
good

evil
in
the
world
now
<EOS>
,
feel
that
he
appreciate
health
the
more
when
somebody

ill

do
not

what
it
may
be

"
<EOS>
My
dear
Miss
Summerson
,
here
be
our
friend
Richard
,
"
say
Mr
Skimpole
,
"
full
of
the
bright
vision
of
the
future
,
which
he
evoke
out
of
the
darkness
of
Chancery
.
 
<EOS>
now
that
be
delightful
<EOS>
,
that
be
inspirit
,
that
be
full
of
poetry
!
 
<EOS>
in
old
time
the
wood
and
solitude
be
make
joyous
to
the
shepherd
by
the
imaginary
piping
and
dancing
of
Pan
and
the
nymph
.
 
<EOS>
this
present
shepherd
,
our
pastoral
Richard
,
brighten
the
dull
Inns
of
Court
by
make
Fortune
and
her
train
sport
through
them
to
the
melodious
note
of
a
judgment
from
the
bench
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
very
pleasant
,
you
know
!
 
<EOS>
some
ill
-
condition
growl
fellow
may
say
to
me
,
"
what
be
the
use
of
these
legal
and
equitable
abuse
?
 
<EOS>
how
do
you
defend
them
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
reply
,
"
My
growl
friend
<EOS>
,
I
don't
defend
them
,
but
they
be
very
agreeable
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
shepherd
---
youth
,
a
friend
of
mine
,
who
transmute
them
into
something
highly
fascinating
to
my
simplicity
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
it
be
for
this
that
they
exist
---
for
I
be
a
child
among
you
worldly
grumbler
,
and
not
call
upon
to
account
to
you
or
myself
for
anything
---
but
it
may
be
so
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
begin
seriously
to
think
that
Richard
could
scarcely
have
find
a
bad
friend
than
this
.
 
<EOS>
It
make
me
uneasy
that
at
such
a
time
when
he
most
require
some
right
principle
and
purpose
he
should
have
this
captivate
looseness
and
putting
-
off
of
everything
,
<EOS>
this
airy
dispense
with
all
principle
and
purpose
,
at
his
elbow
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
could
understand
how
such
a
nature
as
my
guardian
's
,
experience
in
the
world
and
force
to
contemplate
the
miserable
evasion
and
contention
of
the
family
misfortune
,
find
an
immense
relief
in
Mr
Skimpole
's
avowal
of
his
weakness
and
display
of
guileless
candour
;
but
I
could
not
satisfy
myself
that
it
be
as
artless
as
it
seem
or
that
it
do
not
serve
Mr
Skimpole
's
idle
turn
quite
as
well
as
any
other
part
,
and
with
less
trouble
.
   
<EOS>
They
both
walk
back
with
me
,
and
Mr
Skimpole
leave
us
at
the
gate
,
I
walk
softly
in
with
Richard
and
say
,
"
Ada
,
my
love
,
I
have
bring
a
gentleman
to
visit
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
difficult
to
read
the
blushing
,
startled
face
.
 
<EOS>
She
love
him
dearly
,
and
he
know
it
,
and
I
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
transparent
business
,
that
meeting
as
cousin
only
.
   
<EOS>
I
almost
mistrust
myself
as
grow
quite
wicked
in
my
suspicion
,
but
I
be
not
so
sure
that
Richard
love
her
dearly
.
<EOS>
He
admire
her
very
much
---
any
one
must
have
do
that
---
and
I
dare
say
would
have
renew
their
youthful
engagement
with
great
pride
and
ardour
but
that
he
know
how
she
would
respect
her
promise
to
my
guardian
.
 
<EOS>
still
I
have
a
tormenting
idea
that
the
influence
upon
him
extend
even
here
,
that
he
be
postpone
his
good
truth
and
earnestness
in
this
as
in
all
thing
until
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
should
be
off
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
ah
me
!
 
<EOS>
what
Richard
would
have
be
without
that
blight
,
I
never
shall
know
now
!
   
<EOS>
He
tell
Ada
,
in
his
most
ingenuous
way
,
that
he
have
not
come
to
make
any
secret
inroad
on
the
term
she
have
accept
(
rather
too
implicitly
and
confidingly
,
he
think
)
from
Mr
Jarndyce
,
that
he
have
come
openly
to
see
her
and
to
see
me
and
to
justify
himself
for
the
present
term
on
which
he
stand
with
Mr
Jarndyce
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
dear
old
infant
would
be
with
us
directly
,
he
beg
that
I
would
make
an
appointment
for
the
morning
,
when
he
may
set
himself
right
through
the
mean
of
an

exquisite

the
richness
of
the

increase
twenty

fold
since
yesterday

as

in

Nature

more
wakeful

again
the

well

We

approach

My

how

blind

do

that

be
very
well
for
him
to
wish
me
to
know
nothing
of
the
suit

care
nothing
about
it

that
it

well

<EOS>
"
oh

Richard

I
remonstrate

be
it

deeply

be
silent
for

I
be
sure
you
know

not

poor

his

indifference

may
cause
other
party

become
lax
about

may
die
off

happen

I
be
so
touch
with
pity
for
Richard

I
could
not
reproach
him
any
more

even
by
a
look

<EOS>
I
remember
my
guardian

gentleness

his
error

with
what
perfect
freedom
from
resentment
he
have
speak
of
them

Esther

"
Richard
resume
,
"
you
be
not

I
have
only
come

what
I

it
be
all
very
well

we
get
on
very
well

I
be
a
boy

utterly
regardless

suit

as
soon

I
begin

take
an
interest

to
look
into

it

quite
another
thing

then
John

off

I

confiding

Ada

I
tell
him
that

be
more
like
himself

those
latter

than
in
anything
he
have

<EOS>
"
why
,
"
acknowledge
Richard

that
may
be
true
enough
,
my
love

<EOS>
I
rather
feel
it
to
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
shall
be
able
to
give
myself
fair
-
play
by
and
by

I
shall
come
all
right
again
,
then
,
do
not
you
be
afraid

"
   
<EOS>
I
ask
him
if
this
be
all
he
wish
me
to
tell
Ada
.
   
<EOS>
"
not
quite
,
"
say
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
bind
not
to
withhold
from
her
that
John
Jarndyce
answer
my
letter
in
his
usual
manner
,
address
me
as
"
My
dear
Rick

"

to
argue
me
out
of
my
opinion
,
and
tell
me
that
they
should
make
no
difference
in
him

<EOS>
(
all
very
well
of
course
,
but
not
alter
the
case
.
)
 
<EOS>
I
also
want
Ada
to
know
that
if
I
see
her
seldom
just
now
,
I
be
look
after
her
interest
as
well
as
my
own
<EOS>
---
we
two
be
in
the
same
boat
exactly

and
that
I
hope
she
will
not
suppose
from
any
flying
rumour
she
may
hear
that
I
be
at
all
light
-
head
or
imprudent
;
on
the
contrary
,
I
be
always
look
forward
to
the
termination
of
the
suit

always
plan
in
that
direction

<EOS>
be
of
age
now

have
take
the
step
I
have
take
,
I
consider
myself
free
from
any
accountability
to
John
Jarndyce
;
but
Ada
be
still
a
ward
of
the
court
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
yet
ask
her
to
renew
our
engagement
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
be
free
to
act
for
herself
,
I
shall
be
myself
once
more
and
we
shall
both
be
in
very
different
worldly
circumstance
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
tell
her
all
this
with
the
advantage
of
your
considerate
way

you
will
do
me
a
very
great
and
a
very
kind
service
,
<EOS>
my

Esther
;
and
I
shall
knock
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
on
the
head
with
great
vigour

<EOS>
of

I
ask
for
no

at
Bleak
House

Richard

I

It

<EOS>
My

child
,
certainly
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
throw
myself
into
an
object
so
completely
without
expense
.
 
<EOS>
You
forget
,
or
<EOS>
perhaps
you
do
not
know
,
that
under
either
of
the
will
Ada
and
I
take
something
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
a
question
between
the
large
sum
and
the
small

<EOS>
I
shall
be
within
the
mark
any
way

<EOS>
bless
your

,
my
excellent

say
Richard
,
quite
amuse
with
me
,
"
I
shall
be
all
right
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
pull
through
,
my

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
feel
so
deeply
sensible
of
the
danger
in
which
he
stand
that
I
try
,
in
Ada
's
name
,
in
my
guardian
's
,
in
my
own
,
by
every
fervent
<EOS>
mean
that
I
could
think
of
,
to
warn
him
of
it
and
to
show
him
some
of
his
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
He
receive
everything
I
say
with
patience
and
gentleness
,
but
it
all
rebound
from
him
without
take
the
least
effect
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
wonder
at
this
after
the
reception
his
preoccupied
mind
have
give
to
my
guardian
's
letter
,
but
I
determine
to
try
Ada
's
influence
yet
.
   
<EOS>
so
when
our
walk
bring
us
round
to
the
village
again
,
and
I
go
home
to
breakfast
,
I
prepare
Ada
for
the
account
I
be
go
to
give
her
and
tell
her
exactly
what
reason
we
have
to
dread
that
Richard
be
lose
himself
and
scatter
his
whole
life
to
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
It
make
her
very
unhappy
,
of
course
,
though
she
have
a
far
,
far
great
reliance
on
his
correct
his
error
than
I
could
have
---
which
be
so
natural
and
loving
in
my
dear
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
she
presently
write
him
this
little
letter
:
   
<EOS>
My
dear
cousin
,
   
Esther
have
tell
me
all
you
say
to
her
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
write
this
to
repeat
most
earnestly
for
myself
all
that
she
say
to
you
and
to
let
you
know
how
sure
I
be
that
you
will
sooner
or
later
find
our
cousin
John
a
pattern
of
truth
,
sincerity
,
and
goodness
,
when
you
will
deeply
,
deeply
grieve
to
have
do
him
(
without
intend
it
)
<EOS>
so
much
wrong
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
quite
know
how
to
write
what
I
wish
to
say
next
,
but
I
trust
you
will
understand
it
as
I
mean
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
some
fear
,
my
dear
cousin
,
that
it
may
be
partly
for
my
sake
you
be
now
lay
up
so
much
unhappiness
for
yourself
---
and
if
for
yourself
,
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
in
case
this
should
be
so
,
or
in
case
you
should
entertain
much
thought
of
me
in
what
you
be
do
,
I
most
earnestly
entreat
and
beg
you
to
desist
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
do
nothing
for
my
sake
that
will
make
me
half
so
happy
as
for
ever
turn
your
back
upon
the
shadow
in
which
we
both
be
bear
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
be
angry
with
me
for
say
this
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
pray
,
dear
Richard
,
for
my
sake
,
and
for
your
own
,
and
in
a
natural
repugnance
for
that
source
of
trouble
which
have
its
share
in
make
us
both
orphan
when
we
be
very
young
,
pray
,
pray
,
let
it
go
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
reason
to
know
by
this
time
that
there
be
no
good
in
it
and
no
hope
,
that
there
be
nothing
to
be
get
from
it
but
sorrow
.
   
<EOS>
My
dear
cousin
,
it
be
needless
for
me
to
say
that
you
be
quite
free
and
that
it
be
very
likely
you
may
find
some
one
whom
you
will
love
much
better
than
your
first
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
quite
sure
,
if
you
will
let
me
say
so
,
that
the
object
of
your
choice
would
greatly
prefer
to
follow
your
fortune
far
and
wide
,
however
moderate
or
poor
,
and
see
you
happy
,
do
your
duty
and
pursue
your
choose
way
,
than
to
have
the
hope
of
be
,
or
even
to
be
,
very
rich
with
you
<EOS>
(
if
such
a
thing
be
possible
)
at
the
cost
of
drag
year
of
procrastination
and
anxiety
and
of
your
indifference
to
other
aim
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
wonder
at
my
saying
this
so
confidently
with
so
little
knowledge
or
experience
,
but
I
know
it
for
a
certainty
from
my
own
heart
.
   
<EOS>
ever
,
my
dear
cousin
,
your
most
affectionate
   
ada
   
<EOS>
this
note
bring
Richard
to
us
very
soon
,
but
it
make
little
change
in
him
if
any
.
 
<EOS>
We
would
fairly
try
,
he
say
,
who
be
right
and
who
be
wrong
<EOS>
---
he
would
show
us
---
we
should
see
!
 
<EOS>
He
be
animate
and
glowing
,
as
if
Ada
's
tenderness
have
gratify
him
;
but
I
could
only
hope
,
with
a
sigh
,
that
the
letter
may
have
some
strong
effect
upon
his
mind
on
re
-
perusal
than
it
assuredly
have
then
.
   
<EOS>
as
they
be
to
remain
with
us
that
day
and
have
take
their
place
to
return
by
the
coach
next
morning
,
I
seek
an
opportunity
of
speak
to
Mr
Skimpole
.
 
<EOS>
Our
out
-
of
-
door
life
easily
throw
one
in
my
way
,
and
I
delicately
say
that
there
be
a
responsibility
in
encourage
Richard
.
   
<EOS>
"
responsibility
,
my
dear
Miss
Summerson
?
<EOS>
"
he
repeat
,
catch
at
the
word
with
the
pleasantest
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
the
last
man
in
the
world
for
such
a
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
be
responsible
in
my
life
---
I
can
not
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
everybody
be
oblige
to
be
,
"
say
I
timidly
enough
,
he
be
so
much
old
and
more
clever
than
i.
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
really
?
"
say
Mr
Skimpole
,
receive
this
new
light
with
a
most
agreeable
jocularity
of
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
every
man
's
not
oblige
to
be
solvent
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
be
.
 
<EOS>
see
,
my
dear
Miss
Summerson
,
"
he
take
a
handful
of
loose
silver
and
halfpence
from
his
pocket
,
"
there
be
so
much
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
an
idea
how
much
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
power
of
count
.
 
<EOS>
call
it
four
and
ninepence
<EOS>
---
call
it
four
pound
nine
.
 
<EOS>
They
tell
me
I
owe
more
than
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
I
owe
as
much
as
good
-
natured
people
will
let
me
owe
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
do
not
stop
,
why
should
I
?
 
<EOS>
there
you
have
Harold
Skimpole
in
little
.
 
<EOS>
if
that
be
responsibility
,
I
be
responsible
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
perfect
ease
of
manner
with
which
he
put
the
money
up
again
and
look
at
me
with
a
smile
on
his
refined
face
,
as
if
he
have
be
mention
a
curious
little
fact
about
somebody
else
,
almost
make
me
feel
as
if
he
really
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
when
you
mention
responsibility
,
"
he
resume
,
"
I
be
dispose
to
say
that
I
never
have
the
happiness
of
know
any
one
whom
I
should
consider
so
refreshingly
responsible
as
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
You
appear
to
me
to
be
the
very
touchstone
of
responsibility
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
see
you
,
my
dear
Miss
Summerson
,
intent
upon
the
perfect
working
of
the
whole
little
orderly
system
of
which
you
be
the
centre
,
I
feel
inclined
to
say
to
myself
---
in
fact
I
do
say
to
myself
very
often
---
 
that
be
responsibility
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
difficult
,
after
this
,
to
explain
what
I
mean
;
but
I
persist
so
far
as
to
say
that
we
all
hope
he
would
check
and
not
confirm
Richard
in
the
sanguine
view
he
entertain
just
then
.
   
<EOS>
"
most
willingly
,
"
he
retort
,
"
if
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
Miss
Summerson
,
I
have
no
art
,
no
disguise
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
take
me
by
the
hand
and
lead
me
through
Westminster
Hall
in
an
airy
procession
after
fortune
,
I
must
go
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
say
,
"
Skimpole
,
join
the
dance
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
must
join
it
.
 
<EOS>
common
sense
would
not
,
I
know
,
but
I
have
no
common
sense
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
very
unfortunate
for
Richard
,
I
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
so
!
"
return
Mr
Skimpole
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
say
that
,
do
not

<EOS>
let
us
suppose
him

company

account

<EOS>
say
,
upon

<EOS>
Our
dear
Richard
,
sanguine
,
ardent
,
overleap
obstacle
,
burst
with
poetry
like
a
young
bud
,
say
to
this
highly
respectable
companion
,
"
I
see
a
golden
prospect
before
me
;
it
be
very
bright
<EOS>
,
it
be
very
beautiful
,
it
be
very
joyous
;
here
I
go
,
bound
over
the
landscape
to
come
at
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
respectable
companion
instantly
knock
him
down
with
the
rule
account
-
book
;
tell
him
in
a
literal
,
prosaic
way
that
he
see
no
such
thing
;
show
him
it
be
nothing
but
fee
,
fraud
,
horsehair
wig
,
and
black
gown
.
 
<EOS>
now
you
know
that
be
a
painful
change
---
sensible
in
the
last
degree
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
but
disagreeable
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
get
the
rule
account
-
book
<EOS>
,
I
have
none
of
the
tax
-
gatherlng
element
in
my
composition
,
I
be
not
at
all
respectable
,
and
I
do
not
want
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
Odd
perhaps
,
but
so
it
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
idle
to
say
more
,
<EOS>
so
I
propose
that
we
should
join
Ada
and
Richard
,
who
be
a
little
in
advance
,
and
I
give
up
Mr
Skimpole
in
despair
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
over
the
Hall
in
the
course
of
the
morning
and
whimsically
describe
the
family
picture
as
we
walk
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
such
portentous
shepherdess
among
the
Ladies
Dedlock
dead
and
go
,
he
tell
us
,
that
peaceful
crook
become
weapon
of
assault
in
their
hand
.
 
<EOS>
They
tend
their
flock
severely
in
buckram
and
powder
and
put
their
sticking
-
plaster
patch
on
to
terrify
commoner

very

<EOS>
I
be
not
so
easy
now
during
any

<EOS>
that
I
feel
it
a
relief
when
Richard
,
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
,
hurry
away
to
meet
a
stranger
whom
he
first
descry
come
slowly
towards

<EOS>
"

Mr

We

<EOS>
We
have
not

we

,
that
Richard

"
when

"
return
Mr

,
"
he
part
from
our
conversational
friend
Kenge
and
take
up
,
I
believe
,
with
Vholes

<EOS>
indeed
,
I
know
he
do
,
because
I
introduce
him
to
Vholes

<EOS>
"
have

long

<EOS>
ask
Ada

<EOS>
My
dear
Miss
Clare
,
I
have
have
that
kind
of
acquaintance
with
him
which
I
have
have
with
several
gentleman
of
his
profession
.
<EOS>
He
have
do
something
or
other
in
a
very
agreeable
,
civil
manner
---
 
take
proceeding
,
I
think
,
be
the
expression
---
which
end
in
the
proceeding
of
his
take
me
.
 
<EOS>
somebody
be
so
good
as
to
step
in
and
pay
the
money
---
<EOS>
something
and
fourpence
be
the
amount
;
I
forget
the
pound
and
shilling
,
but
I
know
it
end
with
fourpence
,
because
it
strike
me
at
the
time
as
be
so
odd
that
I
could
owe
anybody
fourpence
---
and
after
that
I
bring
them
together
.
 
<EOS>
Vholes
ask
me
for
the
introduction
,
and
I
give
it
.
 
<EOS>
now
I
come
to
think
of
it
,
"
he
look
inquiringly
at
us
with
his
frank
smile
as
he
make
the
discovery
,
"
vhole
bribe
me
,
perhaps
?
 
<EOS>
He
give
me
something
and
call
it
commission
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
a
five
-
pound
note
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
I
think
it
MUST
have
be
a
five
-
pound
note
!
"
   
<EOS>
His
further
consideration
of
the
point
be
prevent
by
Richard
's
come
back
to
us
in
an
excited
state
and
hastily
represent
Mr
Vholes
---
a
sallow
man
with
pinched
lip
that
look
as
if
they
be
cold
,
a
red
eruption
here
and
there
upon
his
face

there
be
nothing
so
remarkable
in
him
as
a
lifeless
manner
and
a
slow
,
fixed
way
he
have
of
look
at
Richard
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
do
not
disturb
you

"
say
Mr
Vholes
,
and
now
I
observe
that
he
be
further
remarkable
for
an
inward
manner
of
speak

<EOS>

I
arrange
with
Mr

"
Mr

have
lay
down

Mr

when

it
devolve
upon

out

<EOS>
I
wish
in
business
to
be
exact

open

<EOS>
I
be
a
widower

Emma

my

be
so
to
discharge
the
duty

this
appear
to
be

<EOS>
the
remark
be
make
to
me
in
consequence
of
my
be
next
him
as
we

I
assent

enumerate
its
chief
attraction
.
   
<EOS>
"
indeed

say
Mr
Vholes

<EOS>
"
I
have
the
privilege
of

I
admire

very
much

<EOS>
I
have
no
idea

there
be
anything
so
attractive
here

"
   
<EOS>
to
keep
up
the
conversation

I
ask
Mr

if
he
would
like
to
live
altogether
in
the
country

<EOS>
"
there
,
miss

he
,
"
you
touch
me
on
a
tender
string

<EOS>
My
health
be
not
good
(
my
digestion
be
much
impaired
)
,
and
if
I
have
only
myself
to
consider
,
I
should
take
refuge
in
rural
habit
,
especially
as
the
care
of
business
have
prevent
me
from
ever
come
much
into

with

society

with
my

my

I
can
not
afford
to
be
selfish

It
be
true
<EOS>
I
have
no
long
to
maintain
a
dear
grandmother
who
die
in
her
hundred

second
year

enough
remain
to
render
it
indispensable
that
the
mill
should
be
always
go

<EOS>
It
require
some
attention
to
hear
him
on
account
of
his
inward
speaking
and
his
lifeless
manner

"
You
will

something

aloud

aloud

I
suppose

we
make
it
as

I
have
before

the

the

road
close

the
more
love
that
unchange

would
have
to

how

he
be
,
in

just

"
   
<EOS>
It
strike
me
that
if
Mrs
Jellyby
have
discharge
her
own
natural
duty
and
obligation
before
she
sweep
the
horizon
with
a
telescope
in
search
of
other
,
she
would
have
take
the
good
precaution
against
become
absurd
,
but
<EOS>
I
need
scarcely
observe
that
I
keep
this
to
myself
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
your
papa
,
Caddy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
come
here
every
evening

return
Caddy
,
"
and
be
so
fond
of
sit
in
the
corner
there
that
it
be
a
treat
to
see
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
look
at
the
corner
,
I
plainly
perceive
the
mark
of
Mr
Jellyby
's
head
against
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
consolatory
to
know
that
he
have
find
such
a
resting
-
place
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
you
,
Caddy
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
be
always
busy

I
will
be
bind

"
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear

"
return
Caddy
,
"
<EOS>
I
be
indeed
,
for
to
tell
you
a
grand
secret
,
I
be
qualify
myself
to
give
lesson
.
 
<EOS>
Prince
's
health
be
not
strong
,
and
I
want
to
be
able
to
assist
him
.
 
<EOS>
what
with
school
,
and
class
here
,
and
private
pupil
,
and
the
apprentice
,
he
really
have
too
much
to
do
,
poor
fellow
!
"
   
<EOS>
the
notion
of
the
apprentice
be
still
so
odd
to
me
that
I
ask
Caddy
if
there
be
many
of
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
four
,
"
say
Caddy
.
 
<EOS>
"
one
in

door
,
and
three
out

<EOS>
They
be
very
good
child
;
only
when
they
get
together
they
WILL
play
---
 
child
-
like

instead
of
attend
to
their
work
.
 
<EOS>
so
the
little
boy
you
see
just
now
waltz
by
himself
in
the
empty
kitchen
,
and
we
distribute
the
other
over
the
house
as
well
as
we
can
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
only
for
their
step

of
course

"
say
I.
   
"
only
for
their
step
,
"
say
Caddy
.
 
<EOS>
"
in
that
way
they
practise
,
so
many
hour
at
a
time
,
whatever
step
they
happen
to
be
upon
.
 
<EOS>
They
dance
in
the
academy
,
and
at
this
time
of
year
we
do
figure
at
five
every
morning

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
what
a
laborious
life

I
exclaim
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you

when
the
out

apprentice

us
up
in
the
morning
(
the
bell
ring
into
our
room
,
not
to
disturb
old
Mr
Turveydrop
)
,
and
when
I
put
up
the
window
and
see
them
stand
on
the
door

step
with
their
little
pump
under
their
arm

I
be
actually
remind
of
the
sweep

<EOS>
all
this
present
the
art
to
me
in
a
singular
light
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
Caddy
enjoy
the
effect
of
her
communication
and
cheerfully
recount
the
particular
of
her
own
study
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
my
dear
,
to
save
expense
<EOS>
I
ought
to
know
something
of
the
piano
,
and
I
ought
to
know
something
of
the
kit
too
,
and
consequently
I
have
to
practise
those
two
instrument
as
well
as
the
detail
of
our
profession
.
 
<EOS>
if
Ma
have
be
like
anybody
else
,
I
may
have
have
some
little
musical
knowledge
to
begin
upon
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
have
not
any
;
and
that
part
of
the
work
be
,
at
first
,
a
little
discouraging
,
I
must
allow
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
a
very
good
ear
,
and
I
be
use
to
drudgery
<EOS>
---
I
have
to
thank
Ma
for
that
,
at
all
event

and
<EOS>
where
there
be
a
will
there
be
a
way
,
you
know

Esther

the
world
over

<EOS>
say
these
word
,
Caddy
laughingly
sit
down
at
a
little
jingling
square
piano
and
really
rattle
off
a
quadrille
with
great
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
good
-
humouredly
and
blushingly
get
up
again
,
and
while
she
still
laugh
herself
,
say
,
"
do
not
laugh
at
me

please
;
that
be
a

"
   
<EOS>
I
would
sooner
have
cry
,
but
I
do
neither
.
 
<EOS>
I
encourage
her
and
praise
her
with
all
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
for
I
conscientiously
believe
,
dancing
-
master
's
wife
though
she
be
,
and
dancing
-
mistress
though
in
her
limited
ambition
she
aspire
to
be
,
she
have
strike
out
a
natural
,
wholesome
,
love
course
of
industry
and
perseverance
that
be
quite
as
good
as
a
mission

<EOS>
"
My

Caddy

"
you
can
not

I
shall
owe
you

you

much

<EOS>
what
change

Esther

even
in

<EOS>
You
recollect
that
first
night
,
when
I
be
so
unpolite
and
inky
?
 
<EOS>
who
would
have
think
,
then
,
of
my
ever
teach
people
to
dance
,
of
all
other
possibility
and
impossibility
!
"
   
<EOS>
Her
husband
,
who
have
leave
us
while
we
have
this
chat
,
now
come
back
,
preparatory
to
exercise
the
apprentice
in
the
ball
-
room
<EOS>
,
Caddy
inform
me
<EOS>
she
be
quite
at
my
disposal
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
my
time
yet
,
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
tell
her
,
for
I
should
have
be
vex
to
take
her
away
then
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
we
three
adjourn
to
the
apprentice
together
,
and
I
make
one
in
the
dance
.
   
<EOS>
the
apprentice
be
the
queer
little
people
.
 
<EOS>
besides
the
melancholy
boy
,
who
,
I
hope
,
have
not
be
make
so
by
waltz
alone
in
the
empty
kitchen
,
there
be
two
other
boy
and
one
dirty
little
limp
girl
in
a
gauzy
dress
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
precocious
little
girl
,
with
such
a
dowdy
bonnet
on
(
that
,
too
,
of
a
gauzy
texture
)
,
who
bring
her
sandalled
shoe
in
an
old
threadbare
velvet
reticule
.
<EOS>
such
mean
little
boy
,
when
they
be
not
dance
,
with
string
,
and
marble
,
and
cramp
-
bone
in
their
pocket
,
and
the
most
untidy
leg
and
foot
---
and
heel
particularly
.
   
<EOS>
I
ask
Caddy
what
have
make
their
parent
choose
this
profession
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
Caddy
say
she
do
not
know
;
perhaps
they
be
design
for
teacher
,
perhaps
for
the
stage
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
all
people
in
humble
circumstance
,
and
the
melancholy
boy
's
mother
keep
a
ginger
-
beer
shop
.
   
<EOS>
We
dance
for
an
hour
with
great
gravity
,
the
melancholy
child
do
wonder
with
his
low
extremity
,
in
which
there
appear
to
be
some
sense
of
enjoyment
though
it
never
rise
above
his
waist
.
<EOS>
Caddy
,
while
she
be
observant
of
her
husband
and
be
evidently
found
upon
him
,
have
acquire
a
grace
and
self
-
possession
of
her
own
,
which
,
unite
to
her
pretty
face
and
figure
,
be
uncommonly
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
She
already
relieve
him
of
much
of
the
instruction
of
these
young
people
,
and
he
seldom
interfere
except
to
walk
his
part
in
the
figure
if
he
have
anything
to
do
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
always
play
the
tune
.
 
<EOS>
the
affectation
of
the
gauzy
child
,
and
her
condescension
to
the
boy
,
be
a
sight
.
 
<EOS>
and
thus
we
dance
an
hour
by
the
clock
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
practice
be
conclude
,
Caddy
's
husband
make
himself
ready
to
go
out
of
town
to
a
school
,
and
Caddy
run
away
to
get
ready
to
go
out
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
in
the
ball
-
room
in
the
interval
,
contemplate
the
apprentice
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
out
-
door
boy
go
upon
the
staircase
to
put
on
their
half
-
boot
and
pull
the
in
-
door
boy
's
hair
,
as
I
judge
from
the
nature
of
his
objection
.
 
<EOS>
return
with
their
jacket
button
and
their
pump
stick
in
them
,
they
then
produce
packet
of
cold
bread
and
meat
and
bivouac
under
a
paint
lyre
on
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
the
little
gauzy
child
,
have
whisk
her
sandal
into
the
reticule
and
put
on
a
trodden
-
down
pair
of
shoe
,
shake
her
head
into
the
dowdy
bonnet
at
one
shake
,
and
answer
my
inquiry
whether
she
like
dance
by
reply
,
"
not
with
boy
,
"
tie
it
across
her
chin
,
and
go
home
contemptuous
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Old
Mr
Turveydrop
be
so
sorry
,
"
say
Caddy
,
"
that
he
have
not
finish
dress
yet
and
can
not
have
the
pleasure
of
see
you
before
you
go
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
such
a
favourite
of
his
,
Esther
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
express
myself
much
oblige
to
him
,
but
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
add
that
I
readily
dispense
with
this
attention
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
take
him
a
long
time
to
dress
,
"
say
Caddy
,
"
because
he
be
very
much
look
up
to
in
such
thing
,
you
know
,
and
have
a
reputation
to
support
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
think
how
kind
he
be
to
<EOS>
Pennsylvania
 
He
talk
to
Pa
of
an
evening
about
the
Prince
Regent
,
and
I
never
see
Pa
so
interested

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
the
picture
of
Mr
Turveydrop
bestow
his
deportment
on
Mr
Jellyby
that
quite
take
my
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
Caddy
if
he
bring
her
papa
out
much
.
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Caddy
,
"
I
do
not
know
that
he
do
that
,
but
he
talk
to
Pa
,
and
Pa
greatly
admire
him
,
and
listen
,
and
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
I
be
aware
that
Pa
have
hardly
any
claim
to
deportment
,
but
they
get
on
together
delightfully
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
think
what
good
companion
they
make
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
Pa
take
snuff
before
in
my
life
,
but
he
take
one
pinch
out
of
Mr
Turveydrop
's
box
regularly
and
keep
put
it
to
his
nose
and
take
it
away
again
all
the
evening

with
a
little
hesitation

I
be
most
afraid
of

next

have
any

discovery

you

you

could

would

<EOS>
national
and
domestic
 
England
have
be
in
a
dreadful
state
for
some
week
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Coodle
would
go
out
,
Sir
Thomas
Doodle
would
not
come
in
,
and
there
be
nobody
in
Great
Britain
(
to
speak
of
)
except
Coodle
and
Doodle
<EOS>
,
there
have
be
no
government
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
mercy
that
the
hostile
meeting
between
those
two
great
man
,
which
at
one
time
seem
inevitable
,
do
not
come
off
,
because
if
both
pistol
have
take
effect
,
and
Coodle
and
Doodle
have
kill
each
other
,
it
be
to
be
presume
that
England
must
have
wait
to
be
govern
until
young
Coodle
and
young
Doodle
,
now
in
frock
and
long
stocking
,
be
grow
up
.
 
<EOS>
this
stupendous
national
calamity
,
however
,
be
avert
by
Lord
Coodle
's
make
the
timely
discovery
that
if
in
the
heat
of
debate
he
have
say
that
he
scorn
and
despise
the
whole
ignoble
career
of
Sir
Thomas
Doodle
<EOS>
,
he
have
merely
mean
to
say
that
party
difference
should
never
induce
him
to
withhold
from
it
the
tribute
of
his
warm
admiration
;
while
it
as
opportunely
turn
out
,
on
the
other
hand
,
that
Sir
Thomas
Doodle
have
in
his
own
bosom
expressly
book
Lord
Coodle
to
go
down
to
posterity
as
the
mirror
of
virtue
and
honour
.
 
<EOS>
still
England
have
be
some
week
in
the
dismal
strait
of
have
no
pilot
(
as
be
well
observe
by
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
)
to
weather
the
storm
;
and
the
marvellous
part
of
the
matter
be
that
England
have
not
appear
to
care
very
much
about
it
,
but
have
go
on
eat
and
drink
and
marry
and
give
in
marriage
as
the
old
world
do
in
the
day
before
the
flood
.
 
<EOS>
but
Coodle
know
the
danger
,
and
Doodle
know
the
danger
,
and
all
their
follower
and
hanger
-
on
have
the
clear
possible
perception
of
the
danger
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
Sir
Thomas
Doodle
have
not
only
condescend
to
come
in
,
but
have
do
it
handsomely
,
bring
in
with
him
all
his
nephew
,
all
his
male
cousin
,
and
all
his
brother
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
so
there
be
hope
for
the
old
ship
yet
.
   
<EOS>
Doodle
have
find
that
he
must
throw
himself
upon
the
country
,
chiefly
in
the
form
of
sovereign
and
beer
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
metamorphosed
state
he
be
available
in
a
good
many
place
simultaneously
and
can
throw
himself
upon
a
considerable
portion
of
the
country
at
one
time
.
 
<EOS>
Britannia
be
much
occupy
in
pocket
Doodle
in
the
form
of
sovereign
,
and
swallow
Doodle
in
the
form

and
in
swear
herself
black
in
the
face
that
she
do
neither
---
 
plainly
to
the
advancement
of
her
glory
and

---
the
London

come

to

would
be

the

over

that
the
fall

moon
out

in
any
communication
with
Sir
Leicester

that
throughout
our
interview
I
have
expressly
state
my
sole
consideration
to
be
Sir
Leicester
's
feeling
and
honour
and
the
family
reputation
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
be
happy
to
have
make
Lady
Dedlock
a
prominent
consideration
,
too
,
if
the
case
have
admit
of
it
;
but
unfortunately
it
do
not
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
attest
your
fidelity
,
sir

"
   
<EOS>
both
before
and
after
save

but
at
length
move
,
and
turn
,
unshaken
in
her
natural
and
acquire
presence
,
towards
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tulkinghorn
open
both
the
door
exactly
as
he
would
have
do
yesterday
,
or
as
he
would
have
do
ten
year
ago
,
and
make
his
old
-
fashioned
bow
as
she
pass
out
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
an
ordinary
look
that
he
receive
from
the
handsome
face
as
it
go
into
the
darkness
,
and
it
be
not
an
ordinary
movement
,
though
a
very
slight
one
,
that
acknowledge
his
courtesy
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
he
reflect
when
he
be
leave
alone
,
the
woman
have
be
put
no
common
constraint
upon
herself
.
   
<EOS>
He
would
know
it
all
the
well
if
he
see
the
woman
pace
her
own
room
with
her
hair
wildly
throw
from
her
flung
-
back
face
,
her
hand
clasped
behind
her
head
,
her
figure
twist
as
if
by
pain
.
<EOS>
He
would
think
so
all
the
more
if
he
see
the
woman
thus
hurry
up
and
down
for
hour
,
without
fatigue
,
without
intermission
,
follow
by
the
faithful
step
upon
the
Ghost

walk

<EOS>
but
he
shut
out
the
now
chill
air
,
draw
the
window

curtain
,
go
to
bed
,
and
fall
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
and
truly
when

star
go
out
and
the
wan
day
peep
into
the
turret

chamber
,
find
him
at
his
old

<EOS>
the
same
wan
day

in
at
Sir

repentant
country
in
a
majestically
condescend
dream
;
and
at
the
cousin

principally
receipt
of
salary
;
and
at
the
chaste
Volumnia
,
bestow
a
dower
of
fifty
thousand
pound
upon
a
hideous
old
general
with
a
mouth
of
false
tooth
like
a
pianoforte
too
full
of
key
,
long
the
admiration
of
Bath
and
the
terror
of
every
other
commuuity

<EOS>
also
into
room
high
in
the
roof

and
into
office

<EOS>
up

the
bright
sun
,
draw
everything
up
with
it
---
the
Wills

Sallys
,
the
latent
vapour
in

earth

the
drooping
leave

the
bird

lastly
,
up
come

flag
over
Mr

Mr

appear
to
have
set
out
in
this

with
some
desperate
design

on
reflection
cough
again

excuse
himself

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
not

she

very
much
give

<EOS>
and
you
see
,
a
foreign
female
of
that
genteel
appearance
come
into
the
shop
,
and
hovering

I
should
be
the
last
to
make
use
of
a
strong
expression

hovering

Mr

have
say
this
in

plaintive
manner

throw
in
a
cough
of
general
application
to
fill
up
all
the
blank

<EOS>
"
why

do

ask
Mr

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
just
so
,

return
Mr

I

you

would
excuse
the
reasonableness
of
my

couple
with
the

excitableness

<EOS>
You
see
,
the
foreign
female
---
which
you
mention
her
name
just
now
,
with
quite
a
native
sound
<EOS>
I
be
sure
---
<EOS>
catch
up
the
word

night

be
uncommon
quick

make
inquiry
,

get
the
direction

come

time

<EOS>
now
Guster
,
our
young
woman
,
be
timid
and
have
fit
,
and
<EOS>
she
,
take
fright
at
the
foreigner
's
look
---
which
be
fierce
---
and
at
a
grinding
manner
that
she
have
of
speak
---
which
be
calculate
to
alarm
a
weak
mind
---
give
way
to
it
,
instead
of
bear
up
against
it
,
and
tumble
down
the
kitchen
stair
out
of
one
into
another
,
such
fit
as
I
do
sometimes
think
be
never
go
into
,
or
come
out
of

in
any
house

ours

<EOS>
consequently
there
be
by
good
fortune
ample
occupation

answer
the

<EOS>
when

employer
(
which
I
have
no
doubt
at

be
a
foreign
mode
of

she
would
do
herself
the
pleasure

continually
call
at
my

impossible

have
already
give
rise

the
painfullest
mistake
even
in

not

It
would
be
contradictory

foam
at

mouth

otherwise

Esther
's
Narrative
 
<EOS>
It
matter
little
now
how
much
I
think
of
my
live
mother
who
have
tell
me
evermore
to
consider
her
dead
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
venture
to
approach
her
or
to
communicate
with
her
in
writing
,
for
my
sense
of
the
peril
in
which
her
life
be
pass
be
only
to
be
equal
by
my
fear
of
increase
it
.
 
<EOS>
know
that
my
mere
existence
as
a
live
creature
be
an
unforeseen
danger
in
her
way
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
always
conquer
that
terror
of
myself
which
have
seize
me
when
I
first
know
the
secret
.
 
<EOS>
at
no
time
do
I
dare
to
utter
her
name
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
I
do
not
even
dare
to
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
conversation
anywhere
,
when
I
be
present
,
take
that
direction
,
as
it
sometimes
naturally
do
,
I
try
not
to
hear
:
I
mentally
count
,
repeat
something
that
I
know
,
or
go
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
conscious
now
that
I
often
do
these
thing
when
there
can
have
be
no
danger
of
her
be
speak
of
,
but
I
do
them
in
the
dread
I
have
of
hear
anything
that
may
lead
to
her
betrayal
,
and
to
her
betrayal
through
me
.
   
<EOS>
It
matter
little
now
how
often
I
recall
the
tone
of
my
mother
's
voice
,
wonder
whether
I
should
ever
hear
it
again
as
I
so
long
to
do
,
and
think
how
strange
and
desolate
it
be
that
it
should
be
so
new
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
matter
little
that
I
watch
for
every
public
mention
of
my
mother
's
name
;
that
I
pass
and
repasse
the
door
of
her
house
in
town
,
love
it
,
but
afraid
to
look
at
it
;
that
I
once
sit
in
the
theatre
when
my
mother
be
there
and
see
me
,
and
when
we
be
so
wide
asunder
before
the
great
company
of
all
degree
that
any
link
or
confidence
between
us
seem
a
dream
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
all
,
all
over
.
 
<EOS>
My
lot
have
be
so
blest
that
I
can
relate
little
of
myself
which
be
not
a
story
of
goodness
and
generosity
in
other
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
well
pass
that
little
and
go
on
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
be
settle
at
home
again
,
Ada
and
I
have
many
conversation
with
my
guardian
of
which
Richard
be
the
theme
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
girl
be
deeply
grieve
that
he
should
do
their
kind
cousin
so
much
wrong
,
but
she
be
so
faithful
to
Richard
that
she
could
not
bear
to
blame
him
even
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
My
guardian
be
assure
of
it
,
and
never
couple
his
name
with
a
word
of
reproof
.
 
<EOS>
"
Rick
be
mistaken
,
my
dear
,
"
he
would
say
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
well
!
 
<EOS>
We
have
all
be
mistake
over
and
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
trust
to
you
and
time
to
set
him
right
.
"
   
<EOS>
We
know
afterwards
what
we
suspect
then
,
that
he
do
not
trust
to
time
until
he
have
often
try
to
open
Richard
's
eye

<EOS>
that
he
have
write
to
him
,
go
to
him
,
talk
with
him
,
try
every
gentle
and
persuasive
art
his
kindness
could
devise

<EOS>
Our
poor
devoted
Richard
be
deaf
and
blind
to
all
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
be
wrong
,
he
would
make
amend
when
the
Chancery
suit
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
be
grope
in
the
dark
,
he
could
not
do
better
than
do
his
utmost
to
clear
away
those
cloud
in
which
so
much
be
confused
and
obscure
.
 
<EOS>
suspicion
and
misunderstanding
be
the
fault
of
the
suit
?
 
<EOS>
then
let
him
work
the
suit
out
and
come
through
it
to
his
right
mind
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
his
unvarying
reply
.
 
<EOS>
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
have
obtain
such
possession
of
his
whole
nature
that
it
be
impossible
to
place
any
consideration
before
him
which
he
do
not
,
with
a
distorted
kind
of
reason
,
make
a
new
argument
in
favour
of
his
do
what
he
do
.
"
<EOS>
so
that
it
be
even
more
mischievous
,
"
say
my
guardian
once
to
me
,
"
to
remonstrate
with
the
poor
dear
fellow
than
to
leave
him
alone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
take
one
of
these
opportunity
of
mention
my
doubt
of
Mr
Skimpole
as
a
good
adviser
for
Richard
.
   
<EOS>
"
adviser
!
"
return
my
guardian
,
laugh
,
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
who
would
advise
with
Skimpole
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Encourager
would
perhaps
have
be
a
well
word
,
"
say
I.
   
"
Encourager
!
"
<EOS>
return
my
guardian
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
could
be
encourage
by
Skimpole
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
not
Richard
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
he
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
such
an
unworldly
,
uncalculating
,
gossamer
creature
be
a
relief
to
him
and
an
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
to
advise
or
encouraging
or
occupy
a
serious
station
towards
anybody
or
anything
,
it
be
simply
not
to
be
think
of
in
such
a
child
as
Skimpole
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
pray
,
cousin
John
,
"
say
Ada
,
who
have
just
join
us
and
now
look
over
my
shoulder
,
"
what
make
him
such
a
child
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
what
make
him
such
a
child
?
"
inquire
my
guardian
,
rub
his
head
,
a
little
at
a
loss
.
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
cousin
John
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
he
slowly
reply
,
roughen
his
head
more
and
more
,
"
he
be
all
sentiment
,
and
---
and
susceptibility
,
and
---
and
sensibility
,
and
---
 
and
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
and
these
quality
be
not
regulate
in
him
,
somehow
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
people
who
admire
him
for
them
in
his
youth
attach
too
much
importance
to
them
and
too
little
to
any
training
that
would
have
balance
and
adjust
them
,
and
so
he
become
what
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
hey
?
"
say
my
guardian
,
stop
short
and
look
at
us
hopefully
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
,
you
two
?
"
   
<EOS>
Ada
,
glance
at
me
,
say
she
think
it
be
a
pity
he
should
be
an
expense
to
Richard
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
it
be
,
<EOS>
so
it
be
,
"
return
my
guardian
hurriedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
must
not
be

<EOS>
We
must
arrange
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
prevent
it

<EOS>
that
will
never
do

"
   
<EOS>
and
I
say
I
think
it
be
to
be
regret
that
he
have
ever
introduce
Richard
to
Mr
Vholes
for
a
present
of
five
pound
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
he
?
"
say
my
guardian
with
a
pass
shade
of
vexation
on
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
there
you
have
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
there
you
have
the
man
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
mercenary
in
that
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
idea
of
the
value
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
He
introduce
Rick
,
and
then
he
be
good
friend
with
Mr
Vholes
and
borrow
five
pound
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
mean
nothing
by
it
and
think
nothing
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
you
himself
,
I
will
be
bind
,
my
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
!
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
exactly
!
"
cry
my
guardian
,
quite
triumphant
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
you
have
the
man
!
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
mean
any
harm
by
it

be
conscious
of
any
harm
in
it

he
would
not
tell

<EOS>
He
tell
it
as
he
do
it
in
mere
simplicity

<EOS>
but
you
shall
see
him
in
his
own
home
,
and
then
you
will
understand
him
better

<EOS>
We
must
pay
a
visit
to
Harold
Skimpole

caution
him
on
these
point

Lord
bless
you

my

an
infant

an
infant

"
   
<EOS>
in
pursuance
of
this
plan
,
we
go
into
London
on
an
early
day
and
present
ourselves
at
Mr
Skimpole
's
door
.
   
<EOS>
He
live
in
a
place
call
the
Polygon
,
in
Somers
Town
,
where
there
be
at
that
time
a
number
of
poor
spanish
refugee
walk
about
in
cloak
,
smoke
little
paper
cigar
.
 
<EOS>
whether
he
be
a
well
tenant
than
one
may
have
suppose
,
in
consequence
of
his
friend
Somebody
always
pay
his
rent
at
last
,
or
whether
his
inaptitude
for
business
render
it
particularly
difficult
to
turn
him
out
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
know
;
but
he
have
occupy
the
same
house
some
year
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
a
state
of
dilapidation
quite
equal
to
our
expectation
.
 
<EOS>
two
or
three
of
the

the
water

off
a
long
time
to
judge
from
the
rusty
state
of
the

and
dirty
footprint
on

step

the
only
sign

<EOS>
a
slatternly
full

blown
girl
who
seem
to
be
burst
out
at
the
rent
in
her
gown

the
crack
in

shoe
like
an
over

ripe
berry
answer
our
knock
by
open
the
door
a
very
little

stop
up
the
gap
with
her
figure

as
she
know
Mr
Jarndyce
(
indeed
Ada

I
both
think
that
she
evidently
associate
him
with
the
receipt
of
her
wage

she
immediately
relent
and
allow
us
to
pass
in
.
 
<EOS>
the
lock
of

she
then
apply
herself
to
secure
it
with
the
chain

which
be

action
either

would
we
go
upstairs

<EOS>
We
go
upstairs
to
the
first
floor
,
still
see
no
other
furniture
than
the
dirty
footprint

<EOS>
Mr
Jarndyce
without
further
ceremony
enter
a

there

It

with
a
large
footstool

a
broken
pane
of
glass

dirty
window

wafere
over

there
be
a
little

nectarine
on

there
be

and
another

Mr

recline
upon

fragrant
coffee

about

Miss
Clare

Miss
Summerson
<EOS>

I
think
Mr
Carstone
be
immensely
rich

<EOS>
I
think
he
have
only
to
make
over
something
,
or
to
sign
a
bond
,
or
a
draft
,
or
a
cheque

a

or
to
put
something
on
a
file
somewhere

to
bring
down
a
shower
of
money

<EOS>

You

the
rich

my

lay
his
hand
emphatically
on
the
sleeve
of
Mr

dressing

"
be
you

My

and
my

Miss
Siunmerson

and
my

how
can
I
do
that
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
business

I

<EOS>
It

he

He

from
great
feat
of
business

present
the
bright

upon
me

<EOS>
I
do
admire
them
---
as
bright
prospect

<EOS>
but
I
know
no
more
about
them

and
I
tell
him
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
helpless
kind
of
candour
with
which
he
present
this
before
us
,
the
light
-
hearted
manner
in
which
he
be
amuse
by
his
innocence
,
the
fantastic
way
in
which
he
take
himself
under
his
own
protection
and
argue
about
that
curious
person
,
combine
with
the
delightful
ease
of
everything
he
say
exactly
to
make
out
my
guardian
's
case
.
 
<EOS>
the
more
I
see
of
him
,
the
more
unlikely
it
seem
to
me
,
when
he
be
present
,
that
he
could
design
,
conceal
,
or
influence
anything
;
and
yet
the
less
likely
that
appear
when
he
be
not
present
,
and
the
less
agreeable
<EOS>
it
be
to
think
of
his
have
anything
to
do
with
any
one
for
whom
I
care
.
   
<EOS>
hear
that
his
examination
(
as
he
call
it
)
be
now
over
,
Mr
Skimpole
leave
the
room
with
a
radiant
face
to
fetch
his
daughter
(
his
son
have
run
away
at
various
time
)
,
leave
my
guardian
quite
delight
by
the
manner
in
which
he
have
vindicate
his
childish
character
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
come
back
,
bring
with
him
the
three
young
lady
and
Mrs
Skimpole
,
who
have
once
be
a
beauty
but
be
now
a
delicate
high
-
nosed
invalid
suffering
under
a
complication
of
disorder

<EOS>
"

Mr

We

"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Skimpole
sigh
,
I
think
,
as
if
she
would
have
be
glad
to
strike
out
this
item
in
the
family
attainment
.
 
<EOS>
I
also
think
that
she
rather
impress
her
sigh
upon
my
guardian
and
that
she
take
every
opportunity
of
throw
in
another
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
pleasant
,
"
say
Mr
Skimpole
,
turn
his
sprightly
eye
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
,
"
and
it
be
whimsically
interesting
to
trace
peculiarity
in
family
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
family
we
be
all
child
,
and
I
be
the
young

<EOS>
the

appear

very
fond

the
Comedy
daughter

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My

,
it
be
true
,
"
say
Mr
Skimpole
,
"
be
it
not
?
 
<EOS>
so
it
be
,
and
so
it
must
be
,
because
like
the
dog
in
the
hymn

"
it
be
our
nature

"
 
<EOS>
now
,
here
be
Miss
Summerson
with
a
fine
administrative
capacity
and
a
knowledge
of
detail
perfectly
surprising
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
sound
very
strange
in
Miss
Summerson
's
ear
,
I
dare
say
,
that
we
know
nothing
about
chop
in
this
house
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
do
not
,
not
the
least
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
not
cook
anything
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
a
needle
and
thread
<EOS>
we
do
not
know
how
to
use
.
 
<EOS>
We
admire
the
people
who
possess
the
practical
wisdom
we
want
,
but
we
do
not
quarrel
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
then
why
should
they
quarrel
with
us
?
 
<EOS>
live
and
let
live
<EOS>
,
we
say
to
them
.
<EOS>
live
upon
your
practical
wisdom
,
and
let
us
live
upon
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
laugh
,
but
as
usual
seem
quite
candid
and
really
to
mean
what
he
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
sympathy
,
my
rose
,
"
say
Mr
Skimpole
,
"
sympathy
for
everything

<EOS>
have
we
not

"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
papa
!
"
cry
the
three
daughter
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
fact
,
that
be
our
family
department
,
"
say
Mr
Skimpole
,
"
in
this
hurly
-
burly
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
capable
of
look
on
and
of
be
interested
,
and
we
do
look
on
,
and
we
are
interested
.
 
<EOS>
what
more
can
we
do
?
 
<EOS>
here
be
my
Beauty
daughter
,
marry
these
three
year
.
 
<EOS>
now
I
dare
say
her
marry
another
child
,
and
have
two
more
,
be
all
wrong
in
point
of
political
economy
,
but
it
be
very
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
our
little
festivity
on
those
occasion
and
exchange
social
idea
.
 
<EOS>
She
bring
her
young
husband
home
one
day
,
and
they
and
their
young
fledgling
have
their
nest
upstairs
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
at
some
time
or
other
Sentiment
and
Comedy
will
bring
their
husband
home
and
have
their
nest
upstairs
too
.
 
<EOS>
so
we
get
on
<EOS>
,
we
do
not
know
how
,
but
somehow
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
look
very
young
indeed
to
be
the
mother
of
two
child
,
and
I
could
not
help
pity
both
her
and
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
evident
that
the
three
daughter
have
grow
up
as
they
could
and
have
have
just
as
little
haphazard
instruction
as
qualify
them
to
be
their
father
's
plaything
in
his
idlest
hour
.
 
<EOS>
His
pictorial
taste
be
consult
,
I
observe
,
in
their
respective
style
of
wear
their
hair
,
the
Beauty
daughter
be
in
the
classic
manner
,
the
Sentiment
daughter
luxuriant
and
flow
,
and
the
Comedy
daughter
in
the
arch
style
,
with
a
good
deal
of
sprightly
forehead
,
and
vivacious
little
curl
dot
about
the
corner
of
her
eye
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
dress
to
correspond
,
though
in
a
most
untidy
and
negligent
way
.
   
<EOS>
Ada
and
I
converse
with
these
young
lady
and
find
them
wonderfully
like
their
father
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
meanwhile
Mr
Jarndyce
(
who
have
be
rub
his
head
to
a
great
extent
,
and
hint
at
a
change
in
the
wind
)
talk
with
Mrs
Skimpole
in
a
corner
,
where
we
could
not
help
hear
the
chink
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Skimpole
have
previously
volunteer
to
go
home
with

the
purpose

It

coarse

My

at
a
rough
kind
of
fellow

a
sort
of
human
hedgehog
roll
up
,
"
say
Mr
Skimpole
,
"
who
be
a
baker
in
this
neighbourhood
and
from
whom
we
borrow
a
couple
of
armchair
.
 
<EOS>
We
want
a
couple
of
arm
-
chair
,
and
we
have
not
get
them
,
and
therefore
of
course
we
look
to
a
man
who
have
get
them
,
to
lend
them
.
 
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
this
morose

He

He

you

<EOS>
not

<EOS>
He
object
to
their
be
wear

<EOS>
I
reason
with
him
,
and
point
out
his
mistake

<EOS>
I
say
,
"
Can
you
,
at
your
time

be
so
headstrong

my

as
to
persist

an
arm

chair
be
a
thing
to
put
upon
a
shelf
and
look
at
?
 
<EOS>
that
it
be
an
object
to
contemplate
,
to
survey
from
a
distance

to
consider
from
a
point

sight

do
not
you
know

<EOS>
He
be
unreasonable
and
unpersuadable
and
use
intemperate
language
.
 
<EOS>
be
as
patient
as
I
be
at
this
minute
,
I
address
another
appeal
to
him

<EOS>
I
say
,
"
now

my

however
our

summer
morning

with
flower
before
me

fruit
upon

the
cloudless
sky
above

the

full

fragrance

contemplate
Nature

<EOS>
I
entreat
you
,
by
our
common
brotherhood

not
to
interpose
between
me

a
subject

so
sublime

the
absurd
figure

baker

he
do
,
"
say
Mr
Skimpole
,
raise
his
laugh
eye
in
playful
astonishinent
;
"
he
do
interpose
that
ridiculous
figure

he
do
,
and
he
will
again

<EOS>
and
therefore
I
be
very
glad
to
get
out
of
his
way
and
to
go
home
with
my
friend
Jarndyce

"
   
<EOS>
It
seem
to
escape
his
consideration
that
Mrs
Skimpole
and
the
daughter
remain
behind
to
encounter
the
baker
,
but
this
be
so
old
a
story
to
all
of
them
that
it
have
become
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
He
take
leave
of
his
family
with
a
tenderness
as
airy
and
graceful
as
any
other
aspect
in
which
he
show
himself
and
ride
away
with
us
in
perfect
harmony
of
mind

<EOS>
We
have
an
opportunity
of
see
through
some
open
door

as
we
go
downstairs

that
his
own
apartment
be
a
palace
to
the
rest
of

I
could
have
no
anticipation

I
have
none

something
very
startling

ever
memorable

<EOS>
Our
guest
be
in
such
spirit
on
the
way
home
that
I
could
do
nothing

listen
to
him
and
wonder
at
him
;
nor
be
I
alone
in
this
,
for
Ada
yield
to
the
same
fascination

<EOS>
as
to
my
guardian

the
wind

which
have
threaten
to
become
fix
in
the
east
when

leave
Somers
Town

veer
completely
round
before

a
couple
of
mile
from

whether
of
questionable
childishness

Mr

a
child

enjoyment
of
change
and
bright
weather

<EOS>
in
no
way
weary
by
his
sally
on
the
road
,
he
be
in
the
drawing

room
before
any

and
I
hear
him
at
the
piano
while
I
be
yet
look
after
my
housekeeping
,
singe
refrain
of
barcarole
and
drinking
song
,
italian

by
the

<EOS>
We
be
all
assemble
shortly
before
dinner
,
and
he
be
still
at
the
piano
idly
pick
out
in
his
luxurious
way
little
strain
of
music
,
and
talk
between
while
of
finish
some
sketch
of
the

old
Verulam

have
get
tired

aloud
in

surprised
voice

I
hear

undoubtedly
prevent

cough
as
if

could
not

hear
another
word

reference

such
an
individual

take
his
leave
with
great
ceremony

politeness

get
to
my

speed

recover
my

very
much
disturb

I
be

find
when
I
go
downstairs
again
that
they
only
rally
me
for
have
be
shy
and
mute
before
the
great
Lincolnshire
baronet

<EOS>
by
that
time
I
have
make
up
my
mind
that
the
period
be
come
when
I
must
tell
my
guardian
what
I
know

the
possibility

bring

,
however
distantly
associated

receive
kindness

obligation
from

be
so
painful

I
feel
I
could
no

myself

his
assistance

when
we
have
retire
for
the
night
,

Ada
and
I
have
have
our
usual
talk
in
our
pretty
room
<EOS>
,
I
go
out
at
my
door
again
and
seek
my
guardian
among
his
book
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
he
always
read
at
that
hour
,
and
as
I
draw
near
I
see
the
light
shine
out
into
the
passage
from
his
reading
-
lamp
.
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
come
in

time

word
to
you
about

<EOS>
He
put
a
chair
for
me
,
shut
his
book
,
and
put
it
by
,
and
turn
his
kind
attentive
face
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
observe
that
it
wear
that
curious
expression
I
have
observe
in
it
once
before

on
that
night
when
he
have
say

readily
understand

look

alarmed

fold
his

at

an
air
of
the
profound
astonishment

await
what
I
should
say

do
not

pass
from

become
graver

He
cross
to

shut

I
have
see
to

resume

afterwards

some
injury

die

him

in

do

that
the
resolution

exact

kiss
me
at
the
door
,
and
when
at
last
I
lie
down
to
sleep
,
my
thought
be
how
could
I
ever
be
busy
enough
<EOS>
,
how
could
I
ever
be
good
enough
,
how
in
my
little
way
could
I
ever
hope
to
be
forgetful
enough
of
myself
,
devote
enough
to
him
,
and
useful
enough
to
other
,
to
show
him
how
I
bless
and
honour
him

<EOS>
the
Letter
and
the
answer
 
<EOS>
My
guardian
call
me
into
his
room
next
morning
,
and
then
I
tell
him
what
have
be
leave
untold
on
the
previous
night
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
to
be
do
,
he
say
,
but
to
keep
the
secret
and
to
avoid
another
such
encounter
as
that
of
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
He
understand
my
feeling
and
entirely
share
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
charge
himself
even
with
restrain
Mr
Skimpole
from
improve
his
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
one
person
whom
he
nee
not
name
to
me
,
it
be
not
now
possible
for
him
to
advise
or
help
.
 
<EOS>
He
wish
it
be
,
but
no
such
thing
could
be
.
<EOS>
if
her
mistrust
of
the
lawyer
whom
she
have
mention
be
well
-
found
,
which
he
scarcely
doubt
,
he
dread
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
something
of
him
,
both
by
sight
and
by
reputation
,
and
it
be
certain
that
he
be
a
dangerous
man
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
happen
,
he
repeatedly
impress
upon
me
with
anxious
affection
and
kindness
,
I
be
as
innocent
of
as
himself
and
as
unable
to
influence
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
nor
do
I
understand
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
any
doubt
tend
towards
you
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
much
suspicion
may
exist
without
that
connexion
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
with
the
lawyer
,
"
I
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
two
other
person
have
come
into
my
mind
since
I
have
be
anxious
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
tell
him
all
about
Mr
Guppy
,
who
I
fear
may
have
have
his
vague
surmise
when
I
little
understand
his
meaning
,
but
in
whose
silence
after
our
last
interview
I
express
perfect
confidence
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
"
say
my
guardian
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
we
may
dismiss
him
for
the
present
.
 
<EOS>
who
be
the
other
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
call
to
his
recollection
the
french
maid
and
the
eager
offer
of
herself
she
have
make
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ha
!
"
<EOS>
he
return
thoughtfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
more
alarming
person
than
the
clerk
.
 
<EOS>
but
after
all
,
my
dear
,
it
be
<EOS>
but
seek
for
a
new
service
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
see
you
and
Ada
a
little
while
before
,
and
it
be
natural
that
you
should
come
into
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
She
merely
propose
herself
for
your
maid
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Her
manner
be
strange
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
and
her
manner
be
strange
when
she
take
her
shoe
off
and
show
that
cool
relish
for
a
walk
that
may
have
end
in
her
death
-
bed
,
"
say
my
guardian
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
useless
self
-
distress
and
torment
to
reckon
up
such
chance
and
possibility
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
very
few
harmless
circumstance
that
would
not
seem
full
of
perilous
meaning
,
so
consider
.
 
<EOS>
be
hopeful
,
little
woman
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
be
nothing
well
than
yourself
;
be
that
,
through
this
knowledge
,
as
you
be
before
you
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
good
you
can
do
for
everybody
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
I
,
share
the
secret
with
you

"
   
"
and
lighten
it
,
guardian
,
so
much
<EOS>
,
"
say
I.
   
"
---
will
be
attentive
to
what
pass
in
that
family
,
so
far
as
I
can
observe
it
from
my
distance
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
the
time
should
come
when
I
can
stretch
out
a
hand
to
render
the
least
service
to
one
whom
it
be
well
not
to
name
even
here
,
I
will
not
fail
to
do
it
for
her
dear
daughter
's
sake

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
thank
him
with
my
whole
heart

<EOS>
what
could
I
ever
do
but
thank
him
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
out
at
the
door
when
he
ask
me
to
stay
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
quickly
turn
round
,
I
see
that
same
expression
on
his
face
again
;
and
all
at
once
,
I
do
not
know
how
,
it
flash
upon
me
as
a
new

far
-
off
possibility
that
I
understand
it

"
<EOS>

<EOS>

I
have
have
some
difficulty
in

I
still

<EOS>
I
should

Would

I

I
must

<EOS>
He
shake
my

say
no
more

<EOS>
nor
be
any
more
say
in
reference
to
this
conversation

either
by
him

me

through
the
whole
week

<EOS>
when
the
appoint
night
come
,
I
say
to
Charley
as
soon
as
I
be
alone
,
"
go
and
knock
at
Mr
Jarndyce

door
,
Charley

for

letter

<EOS>
"
 
Charley
go
up
the
stair
,
and
down
the
stair
,
and
along
the
passage
---
the
zig
-
zag
way
about
the
old
-
fashioned
house
seem
very
long
in
my
listening
ear
that
night
---
and
so
come
back
,
along
the
passage
,
and
down
the
stair
,
and
up
the
stair
,
and
bring
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
lay
it
on
the
table
,
Charley
,
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
so
Charley
lay
it
on
the
table
and
go
to
bed
,
and
I
sit
look
at
it
without
take
it
up
,
think
of
many
thing
.
   
<EOS>
I
begin
with
my
overshadowed
childhood
,
and
pass
through
those
timid
day
to
the
heavy
time
when
my
aunt
lie
dead
,
with
her
resolute
face
so
cold
and
set
,
and
when
I
be
more
solitary
with
Mrs
Rachael
than
if
I
have
have
no
one
in
the
world
to
speak
to
or
to
look
at
.
 
<EOS>
I
pass
to
the
altered
day
when
I
be
so
blest
as
to
find
friend
in
all
around
me
,
and
to
be
beloved
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
to
the
time
when
I
first
see
my
dear
girl
and
be
receive
into
that
sisterly
affection
which
be
the
grace
and
beauty
of
my
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
recall
the
first
bright
gleam
of
welcome
which
have
shine
out
of
those
very
window
upon
our
expectant
face
on
that
cold
bright
night
,
and
which
have
never
pale
.
 
<EOS>
I
live
my
happy
life
there
over
again
<EOS>
,
I
go
through
my
illness
and
recovery
,
I
think
of
myself
<EOS>
so
altered
and
of
those
around
me
so
unchanged
;
and
all
this
happiness
shine
like
a
light
from
one
central
figure
,
represent
before
me
by
the
letter
on
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
I
open
it
and
read
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
impressive
in
its
love
for
me
,
and
in
the
unselfish
caution
it
give
me
,
and
the
consideration
it
show
for
me
in
every
word
,
that
my
eye
be
too
often
blind
to
read
much
at
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
read
it
through
three
time
before
I
lay
it
down
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
think
beforehand
that
I
know
its
purport
,
and
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
ask
me
,
would
I
be
the
mistress
of
Bleak
House
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
love
letter
,
though
it
express
so
much
love
,
but
be
write
just
as
he
would
at
any
time
have
speak
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
his
face
,
and
hear
his
voice
,
and
feel
the
influence
of
his
kind
protect
manner
in
every
line
.
 
<EOS>
It
address
me
as
if
our
place
be
reverse
,
as
if
all
the
good
deed
have
be
mine
and
all
the
feeling
they
have
awaken
his
.
 
<EOS>
It
dwell
on
my
be
young
,
and
he
past
the
prime
of
life
;
on
his
have
attain
a
ripe
age
,
while
I
be
a
child
;
on
his
writing
to
me
with
a
silvered
head
,
and
know
all
this
so
well
as
to
set
it
in
full
before
me
for
mature
deliberation
.
 
<EOS>
It
tell
me
that
I
would
gain
nothing
by
such
a
marriage
and
lose
nothing
by
reject
it
,
for
no
new
relation
could
enhance
the
tenderness
in
which
he
hold
me
,
and
whatever
my
decision
be
,
he
be
certain
it
would
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
consider
this
step
anew
since
our
late
confidence
and
have
decide
on
take
it
,
if
it
only
serve
to
show
me
through
one
poor
instance
that
the
whole
world
would
readily
unite
to
falsify
the
stern
prediction
of
my
childhood
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
the
last
to
know
what
happiness
I
could
bestow
upon
him
,
but
of
that
he
say
no
more
,
for
I
be
always
to
remember
that
I
owe
him
nothing
and
that
he
be
my
debtor
,
and
for
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
often
think
of
our
future
,
and
foresee
that
the
time
must
come
,
and
fear
that
it
may
come
soon
,
when
Ada
(
now
very
nearly
of
age
)
would
leave
us
,
and
when
our
present
mode
of
life
must
be
break
up
,
have
become
accustomed
to
reflect
on
this
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
thus
he
make
it
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
feel
that
I
could
ever
give
him
the
good
right
he
could
have
to
be
my
protector
,
and
if
I
feel
that
I
could
happily
and
justly
become
the
dear
companion
of
his
remain
life
,
superior
to
all
light
chance
and
change
than
death
,
even
then
he
could
not
have
me
bind
myself
irrevocably
while
this
letter
be
yet
so
new
to
me
,
but
even
then
I
must
have
ample
time
for
reconsideration
.
 
<EOS>
in
that
case
,
or
in
the
opposite
case
,
let
him
be
unchanged
in
his
old
relation
,
in
his
old
manner
,
in
the
old
name
by
which
I
call
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
to
his
bright
Dame
Durden
and
little
housekeeper
,
she
would
ever
be
the
same
,
he
know
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
the
substance
of
the
letter
,
write
throughout
with
a
justice
and
a
dignity
as
if
he
be
indeed
my
responsible
guardian
impartially
represent
the
proposal
of
a
friend
against
whom
in
his
integrity
he
state
the
full
case
.
   
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
hint
to
me
that
when
I
have
be
better
look
he
have
have
this
same
proceeding
in
his
thought
and
have
refrain
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
that
when
my
old
face
be
go
from
me
,
and
I
have
no
attraction
,
he
could
love
me
just
as
well
as
in
my
fairer
day
.
<EOS>
that
the
discovery
of
my
birth
give
him
no
shock
.
 
<EOS>
that
his
generosity
rise
above
my
disfigurement
and
my
inheritance
of
shame
.
<EOS>
that
the
more
I
stand
in
need
of
such
fidelity
,
the
more
firmly
I
may
trust
in
him
to
the
last
.
   
<EOS>
but
I
know
it
<EOS>
,
I
know
it
well
now
.
 
<EOS>
It
come
upon
me
as
the
close
of
the
benignant
history
I
have
be
pursue
,
and
I
feel
that
I
have
but
one
thing
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
to
devote
my
life
to
his
happiness
be
to
thank
him
poorly
,
and
what
have
I
wish
for
the
other
night
but
some
new
mean
of
thank
him
?
   
<EOS>
still
I
cry
very
much
,
not
only
in
the
fullness
of
my
heart
after
read
the
letter
,
not
only
in
the
strangeness
of
the
prospect
---
 
for
it
be
strange
though
I
have
expect
the
content
---
but
as
if
something
for
which
there
be
no
name
or
distinct
idea
be
indefinitely
lose
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
happy
,
<EOS>
very
thankful
,
very
hopeful
;
but
I
cry
very
much
.
   
<EOS>
by
and
by
<EOS>
I
go
to
my
old
glass
.
 
<EOS>
My
eye
be
red
and
swollen
,
and
I
say
,
"
oh
,
Esther
,
Esther
,
can
that
be
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
the
face
in
the
glass
be
go
to
cry
again
at
this
reproach
,
but
I
hold
up
my
finger
at
it
,
and
it
stop
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
more
like
the
compose
look
you
comfort
me
with
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
when
you
show
me
such
a
change
!
"
say
I
,
begin
to
let
down
my
hair
.
 
<EOS>
"
when
you
be
mistress
of
Bleak
House
,
you
be
to
be
as
cheerful
as
a
bird
.
 
<EOS>
in
fact
,
you
be
always
to
be
cheerful
;
so
let
us
begin
for
once
and
for
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
go
on
with
my
hair
now
,
quite
comfortably
.
 
<EOS>
I
sob
a
little
still
,
but
that
be
because
I
have
be
cry
,
<EOS>
not
because
I
be
cry
then
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
Esther
,
my
dear
,
you
be
happy
for
life
.
 
<EOS>
happy
with
your
good
friend
,
happy
in
your
old
home
,
happy
in
the
power
of
do
a
great
deal
of
good
,
and
happy
in
the
undeserved
love
of
the
good
of
man
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
think
,
all
at
once
,
if
my
guardian
have
marry
some
one
else
,
how
should
I
have
feel
,
and
what
should
I
have
do
!
 
<EOS>
that
would
have
be
a
change
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
It
present
my
life
in
such
a
new
and
blank
form
that
I
ring
my
housekeeping
key
and
give
them
a
kiss
before
I
lay
them
down
in
their
basket
again
.
   
<EOS>
then
I
go
on
to
think
,
as
I
dress
my
hair
before
the
glass
<EOS>
,
how
often
have
I
consider
within
myself
that
the
deep
trace
of
my
illness
and
the
circumstance
of
my
birth
be
only
new
reason
why
I
should
be
busy
,
busy
,
busy
---
useful
,
amiable
,
serviceable
,
in
all
honest
,
unpretende
way
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
good
time
,
to
be
sure
,
to
sit
down
morbidly
and
cry
!
 
<EOS>
as
to
its
seeming
at
all
strange
to
me
at
first
(
if
that
be
any
excuse
for
crying
,
which
it
be
not
)
that
I
be
one
day
to
be
the
mistress
of
Bleak
House
<EOS>
,
why
should
it
seem
strange
?
 
<EOS>
other
people
have
think
of
such
thing
,
if
I
have
not
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
remember
,
my
plain
dear
,
"
I
ask
myself
,
look
at
the
glass
,
"
what
Mrs
Woodcourt
say
before
those
scar
be
there
about
your
marrying
---
"
   
perhaps
the
name
bring
them
to
my
remembrance
.
 
<EOS>
the
dry
remain
of
the
flower
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
well
not
to
keep
them
now
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
only
be
preserve
in
memory
of
something
wholly
past
and
go
,
but
it
would
be
well
not
to
keep
them
now
.
   
<EOS>
They
be
in
a
book
,
and
it
happen
to
be
in
the
next
room
---
<EOS>
our
sitting
-
room
,
divide
Ada
's
chamber
from
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
a
candle
and
go
softly
in
to
fetch
it
from
its
shelf
.
 
<EOS>
after
I
have
it
in
my
hand
,
I
see
my
beautiful
darling
,
through
the
open
door
,
lie
asleep
,
and
I
steal
in
to
kiss
her
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
weak
in
me
,
I
know
,
and
I
could
have
no
reason
for
cry
;
but
I
drop
a
tear
upon
her
dear
face
,
and
another
,
and
another
.
<EOS>
weak
than
that
,
I
take
the
withered
flower
out
and
put
them
for
a
moment
to
her
lip
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
about
her
love
for
Richard
,
though
,
indeed
,
the
flower
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
take
them
into
my
own
room
and
burn
them
at
the
candle
,
and
they
be
dust
in
an
instant
.
   
<EOS>
on
enter
the
breakfast
-
room
next
morning
,
I
find
my
guardian
just
as
usual
,
quite
as
frank
,
as
open
,
and
free
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
the
least
constraint
in
his
manner
,
there
be
none
(
or
I
think
there
be
none
)
in
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
with
him
several
time
in
the
course
of
the
morning
,
in
and
out
,
when
there
be
no
one
there
,
and
I
think
it
not
unlikely
that
he
may
speak
to
me
about
the
letter
,
but
he
do
not
say
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
so
,
on
the
next
morning
,
and
the
next
,
and
for
at
least
a
week
,
over
which
time
Mr
Skimpole
prolong
his
stay
.
 
<EOS>
I
expect
,
every
day
,
that
my
guardian
may
speak
to
me
about
the
letter
,
but
he
never
do
.
   
<EOS>
I
think
then
,
grow
uneasy
,
that
I
ought
to
write
an
answer
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
over
and
over
again
in
my
own
room
at
night
,
but
I
could
not
write
an
answer
that
at
all
begin
like
a
good
answer
,
so
<EOS>
I
think
each
night
I
would
wait
one
more
day
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
wait
seven
more
day
,
and
he
never
say
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
at
last
,
Mr
Skimpole
have
depart
,
we
three
be
one
afternoon
go
out
for
a
ride
;
and
<EOS>
I
,
be
dress
before
Ada
and
go
down
,
come
upon
my
guardian
,
with
his
back
towards
me
,
stand
at
the
drawing
-
room
window
look
out
.
   
<EOS>
He
turn
on
my
come
in
and
say
,
smile
,
"
aye
,
it
be
you
,
little
woman
,
<EOS>
be
it
?
"
and
look
out
again
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
make
up
my
mind
to
speak
to
him
now
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
have
come
down
on
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
"
Guardian
,
"
I
say
,
rather
hesitate
and
tremble
,
"
when
would
you
like
to
have
the
answer
to
the
letter
<EOS>
Charley
come
for
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
when
it
be
ready
,
my
dear
,
"
he
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
ready
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
be
Charley
to
bring
it
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
pleasantly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
bring
it
myself
,
guardian
,
"
I
return
.
   
<EOS>
I
put
my
two
arm
<EOS>
round
his
neck
and
kiss
him
,
and
he
say
be
this
the
mistress
of
Bleak
House
,
and
I
say
yes
;
<EOS>
and
it
make
no
difference
presently
,
and
we
all
go
out
together
,
and
I
say
nothing
to
my
precious
pet
about
it
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
45
.
<EOS>
in
Trust
 
<EOS>
one
morning
when
I
have
do
jingle
about
with
my
basket
of
key
,
as
my
beauty
and
I
be
walk
round
and
round
the
garden
<EOS>
I
happen
to
turn
my
eye
towards
the
house
and
see
a
long
thin
shadow
go
in
which
look
like
Mr
Vholes
.
 
<EOS>
Ada
have
be
tell
me
only
that
morning
of
her
hope
that
Richard
may
exhaust
his
ardour
in
the
Chancery
suit
by
be
so
very
earnest
in
it
;
and
therefore
,
not
to
damp
my
dear
girl
's
spirit
,
I
say
nothing
about
Mr
Vholes
's
shadow
.
   
<EOS>
presently
come
Charley
,
lightly
wind
among
the
bush
and
trip
along
the
path
,
as
rosy
and
pretty
as
one
of
Flora
's
attendant
instead
of
my
maid
,
say
,
"
oh
,
if
you
please
,
miss
,
would
you
step
and
speak
to
Mr
Jarndyce
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
Charley
's
peculiarity
<EOS>
that
whenever
she
be
charge
with
a
message
she
always
begin
to
deliver
it
as
soon
as
she
behold
,
at
any
distance
,
the
person
for
whom
it
be
intend
.
<EOS>
therefore
I
see
Charley
ask
me
in
her
usual
form
of
word
to
"
step
and
speak
"
to
Mr
Jarndyce
long
before
I
hear
her
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
do
hear
her
,
she
have
say
it
so
often
that
she
be
out
of
breath
.
   
<EOS>
I
tell
Ada
I
would
make
haste
back
and
inquire
of
Charley
as
we
go
in
whether
there
be
not
a
gentleman
with
Mr
Jarndyce
.
 
<EOS>
to
which
Charley
,
whose
grammar
<EOS>
,
I
confess
to
my
shame
,
never
do
any
credit
to
my
educational
power
,
reply
,
"
yes
,
miss
.
 
<EOS>
Him
as
come
down
in
the
country
with
Mr
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
a
more
complete
contrast
than
my
guardian
and
Mr
Vholes
<EOS>
I
suppose
there
could
not
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
them
look
at
one
another
across
a
table
,
the
one
so
open
and
the
other
so
close
,
the
one
so
broad
and
upright
and
the
other
so
narrow
and
stoop
,
the
one
give
out
what
he
have
to
say
in
such
a
rich
ringing
voice
and
the
other
keep
it
in
in
such
a
cold
-
blooded
,
gasping
,
fish
-
like
manner
that
I
think
I
never
have
see
two
people
so
unmatched
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
Mr
Vholes
,
my
dear
,
"
say
my
guardian
.
 
<EOS>
not
with
the
great
urbanity
,
I
must
say
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Vholes
rise
,
glove
and
button
up
as
usual
,
and
seat
himself
again
,
just
as
he
have
seat
himself
beside
Richard
in
the
gig
.
 
<EOS>
not
have
Richard
to
look
at
,
he
look
straight
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Vholes
,
"
say
my
guardian
,
eye
his
black
figure
as
if
he
be
a
bird
of
ill
oman
,
"
have
bring
an
ugly
report
of
our
most
unfortunate
Rick
.
"
 
<EOS>
lay
a
mark
emphasis
on
"
most
unfortunate
"
as
if
the
word
be
rather
descriptive
of
his
connexion
with
Mr
Vholes
.
   
<EOS>
I
sit
down
between
them
;
Mr
Vholes
remain
immovable
,
except
that
he
secretly
pick
at
one
of
the
red
pimple
on
his
yellow
face
with
his
black
glove
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
as
Rick
and
you
be
happily
good
friend
<EOS>
,
I
should
like
to
know
,
"
say
my
guardian
,
"
<EOS>
what
you
think
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Would
you
be
so
good
as
to
---
as
to
speak
up
,
Mr
Vholes
?
"
   
<EOS>
do
anything
<EOS>
but
that
,
Mr
Vholes
observe
,
"
I
have
be
say
that
I
have
reason
to
know
,
Miss
Summerson
,
as
Mr
C
's
professional
adviser
,
that
Mr
C
's
circumstance
be
at
the
present
moment
in
an
embarrassed
state
.
 
<EOS>
not
so
much
in
point
of
amount
as
owe
to
the
peculiar
and
press
nature
of
liability
<EOS>
Mr
C
have
incur
and
the
mean
he
have
of
liquidating
or
meet
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
stave
off
many
little
matter
for
Mr
C
,
but
there
be
a
limit
to
stave
off
,
and
we
have
reach
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
make
some
advance
out
of
pocket
to
accommodate
these
unpleasantness
,
but
I
necessarily
look
to
be
repay
,
for
I
do
not
pretend
to
be
a
man
of
capital
,
and
I
have
a
father
to
support
in
the
Vale
of
Taunton
,
besides
strive
to
realize
some
little
independence
for
three
dear
girl
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
My
apprehension
be
,
Mr
C
's
circumstance
be
such
,
lest
it
should
end
in
his
obtaining
leave
to
part
with
his
commission
,
which
at
all
event
be
desirable
to
be
make
known
to
his
connexion
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Vholes
,
who
have
look
at
me
while
speak
,
here
emerge
into
the
silence
he
could
hardly
be
say
to
have
break
,
so
stifled
be
his
tone

look
before
him
again

imagine
the

his

my

yet
what
can
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
him

Esther

<EOS>
He
would
never
accept
of
help
from
me
now

<EOS>
to
offer
it

hint
at
it
would
be
to
drive
him

nothing

do

Mr

hereupon
address
me
again

what
Mr
Jarndyce
remark
,

be
no

the
case

be
the
difficulty

I
do
not
see
that
anything
be
to

I
do
not
say
that
anything
be

<EOS>
far
from
it

<EOS>
I
merely
come
down
here
under
the
seal
of
confidence
and
mention
it
in
order
that
everything
may
be
openly
carry
on

that
it

afterwards
that

My
wish

that
everything
should

openly
carry
on

I
desire

leave

good

behind

<EOS>
if
I
consult
merely
my

I

objection
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
not
a
professional
attendance
.
 
<EOS>
this
can
he
charge
to
nobody
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
interest
in
it
except
as
a
member
of
society
and
a
father
---
and
a
son
,
"
say
Mr
Vholes
,
who
have
nearly
forget
that
point
.
   
<EOS>
It
appear
to
us
that
Mr
Vholes
say
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
truth
in
intimate
that
he
seek
to
divide
the
responsibility
,
such
as
it
be
,
of
know
Richard
's
situation
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
only
suggest
that
I
should
go
down
to
Deal
,
where
Richard
be
then
station
,
and
see
him
,
and
try
if
it
be
possible
to
avert
the
bad
.
 
<EOS>
without
consult
Mr
Vholes
on
this
point
,
I
take
my
guardian
aside
to
propose
it
,
while
Mr
Vholes
gauntly
stalk
to
the
fire
and
warm
his
funeral
glove
.
   
<EOS>
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
form
an
immediate
objection
on
my
guardian
's
part
,
but
as
I
see
he
have
no
other
,
and
as
I
be
only
too
happy
to
go
,
I
get
his
consent
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
then
merely
to
dispose
of
Mr
Vholes
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
"
say
Mr
Jarndyce
,
"
Miss
Summerson
will
communicate
with
Mr
Carstone
,
and
you
can
only
hope
that
his
position
may
be
yet
retrievable
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
allow
me
to
order
you
lunch
after
your
journey
,
sir

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you

Mr
Jarndyce

say
Mr
Vholes
,
put
out
his
long
black
sleeve
to
check
the
ringing
of
the
bell
,
"
not
any

<EOS>
I
thank
you
,
no
,
not
a
morsel

<EOS>
My
digestion
be
much
impaired
,
and
I
be
but
a
poor
knife
and
fork
at
any
time
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
be
to
partake
of
solid
food
at
this
period
of
the
day
,
I
do
not
know
what
the
consequence
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
everything
have
be
openly
carry
on

<EOS>
sir

I
will
now
with
your
permission
take
my
leave

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
would
that
you
could
take
your
leave
,
and
we
could
all
take
our
leave
,
Mr
Vholes
,
"
<EOS>
return
my
guardian
bitterly
,
"
of
a
cause
you
know
of
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Vholes
,
whose
black
dye
be
so
deep
from
head
to
foot
that
it
have
quite
steam
before
the
fire
,
diffuse
a
very
unpleasant
perfume
,
make
a
short
one
-
side
inclination
of
his
head
from
the
neck
and
slowly
shake
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
whose
ambition
it
be
to
be
look
upon
in
the
light
of
respectable
practitioner

sir

can
but
put
our
shoulder
to
the
wheel
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
it
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
at
least
,
I
do
it
myself
;
and
I
wish
to
think
well
of
my
professional
brother
,
one
and
all
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
sensible
of
an
obligation
not
to
refer
to
me
,
miss
,
in
communicate
with
Mr
C
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
say
I
would
be
careful
not
to
do
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
just
so
,
miss
.
 
<EOS>
good
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jarndyce
,
good
morning
,
sir

"
<EOS>
Mr
Vholes
put
his
dead
glove
,
which
scarcely
seem
to
have
any
hand
in
it
,
on
my
finger
,
and
then
on
my
guardian
's
finger
,
and
take
his
long
thin
shadow
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
of
it
on
the
outside
of
the
coach
,
pass
over
all
the
sunny
landscape
between
us
and
London
,
chill
the
seed
in
the
ground
as
it
glide
along
.
   
<EOS>
of
course
it
become
necessary
to
tell
Ada
where
I
be
go
and
why
I
be
go
,
and
of
course
she
be
anxious
and
distressed
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
too
true
to
Richard
to
say
anything
but
word
of
pity
and
word
of
excuse
,
and
in
a
more
loving
spirit
still
---
my
dear
devoted
girl
!
<EOS>
---
she
write
him
a
long
letter
,
of
which
I
take
charge
.
   
<EOS>
Charley
be
to
be
my
travel
companion
,
though
I
be
sure
I
want
none
and
would
willingly
have
leave
her
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
go
to
London
that
afternoon
,
and
find
two
place
in
the
mail
,
secure
them
.
 
<EOS>
at
our
usual
bed
-
time
,
Charley
and
I
be
roll
away
seaward
with
the
kentish
letter
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
night
's
journey
in
those
coach
time
,
but
we
have
the
mail
to
ourselves
and
do
not
find
the
night
very
tedious
.
 
<EOS>
It
pass
with
me
as
I
suppose
it
would
with
most
people
under
such
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
at
one
while
my
journey
look
hopeful
,
and
at
another
hopeless
.
 
<EOS>
now
I
think
I
should
do
some
good
,
and
now
I
wonder
how
I
could
ever
have
suppose
so
.
 
<EOS>
now
it
seem
one
of
the
most
reasonable
thing
in
the
world
that
I
should
have
come
,
and
now
one
of
the
most
unreasonable
.
 
<EOS>
in
what
state
I
should
find
Richard
,
what
I
should
say
to
him
,
and
what
he
would
say
to
me
occupy
my
mind
by
turn
with
these
two
state
of
feeling
;
and
the
wheel
seem
to
play
one
tune
(
to
which
the
burden
of
my
guardian
's
letter
set
itself
)
over
and
over
again
all
night
.
   
<EOS>
at
last
we
come
into
the
narrow
street
of
Deal
,
and
very
gloomy
they
be
upon
a
raw
misty
morning
.
 
<EOS>
the
long
flat
beach
,
with
its
little
irregular
house
,
wooden
and
brick
,
and
its
litter
of
capstan
,
and
great
boat
,
and
shed
,
and
bare
upright
pole
with
tackle
and
block
,
and
loose
gravelly
waste
place
overgrow
with
grass
and
weed
,
wear
as
dull
an
appearance
as
any
place
I
ever
see
.
 
<EOS>
the
sea
be
heave
under
a
thick
white
fog
;
and
nothing
else
be
move
but
a
few
early
ropemaker
,
who
,
with
the
yarn
twist
round
their
body
,
look
as
if
,
tired
of
their
present
state
of
existence
,
they
be
spin
themselves
into
cordage
.
   
<EOS>
but
when
we
get
into
a
warm
room
in
an
excellent
hotel
and
sit
down
,
comfortably
wash
and
dress
,
to
an
early
breakfast
(
for
it
be
too
late
to
think
of
go
to
bed
)
,
Deal
begin
to
look
more
cheerful
.
 
<EOS>
Our
little
room
be
like
a
ship
's
cabin
,
and
that
delight
Charley
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
fog
begin
to
rise
like
a
curtain
,
and
number
of
ship
that
we
have
have
no
idea
be
near
appear
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
many
sail
the
waiter
tell
us
be
then
lie
in
the
down
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
these
vessel
be
of
grand
size
---
one
be
a
large
indiaman
<EOS>
just
come
home
;
and
when
the
sun
shine
through
the
cloud
,
maktng
silvery
pool
in
the
dark
sea
,
the
way
in
which
these
ship
brighten
,
and
shadow
,
and
change
,
amid
a
bustle
of
boat
pull
off
from
the
shore
to
them
and
from
them
to
the
shore
,
and
a
general
life
and
motion
in
themselves
and
everything
around
them
,
be
most
beautiful
.
   
<EOS>
the
large
indiaman
be
our
great
attraction
because
she
have
come
into
the
down
in
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
surround
by
boat
,
and
we
say
how
glad
the
people
on
board
of
her
must
be
to
come
ashore
.
<EOS>
Charley
be
curious
,
too
,
about
the
voyage
,
and
about
the
heat
in
India
,
and
the
serpent
and
the
tiger
;
and
as
she
pick
up
such
information
much
faster
than
grammar
,
I
tell
her
what
I
know
on
those
point
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
,
too
,
how
people
in
such
voyage
be
sometimes
wreck
and
cast
on
rock
,
where
they
be
save
by
the
intrepidity
and
humanity
of
one
man
.
 
<EOS>
and
Charley
ask
how
that
could
be
,
I
tell
her
how
we
know
at
home
of
such
a
case
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
think
of
send
Richard
a
note
say
I
be
there
,
but
it
seem
so
much
well
to
go
to
him
without
preparation
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
live
in
barrack
I
be
a
little
doubtful
whether
this
be
feasible
,
but
we
go
out
to
reconnoitre
.
 
<EOS>
peep
in
at
the
gate
of
the
barrack
-
yard
,
we
find
everything
very
quiet
at
that
time
in
the
morning
,
and
I
ask
a
sergeant
stand
on
the
guardhouse
-
step
where
he
live
.
 
<EOS>
He
send
a
man
before
to
show
me
,
who
go
up
some
bare
stair
,
and
knock
with
his
knuckle
at
a
door
,
and
leave
us
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
then
!
"
cry
Richard
from
within
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
leave
Charley
in
the
little
passage
,
and
go
on
to
the
half
-
open
door
,
<EOS>
say
,
"
Can
I
come
in
,
Richard
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
Dame
Durden
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
be
write
at
a
table
,
with
a
great
confusion
of
clothe
,
tin
case
,
book
,
boot
,
brush
,
and
portmanteaus
strew
all
about
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
only
half
dress
---
in
plain
clothe
,
I
observe
,
not
in
uniform
---
and
his
hair
be
unbrushed
,
and
he
look
as
wild
as
his
room
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
I
see
after
he
have
heartily
welcome
me
<EOS>
and
I
be
seat
near
him
,
for
he
start
upon
hear
my
voice
and
catch
me
in
his
arm
in
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
Richard
!
 
<EOS>
He
be
ever
the
same
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
down
to
---
ah
,
poor
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
---
to
the
end
,
he
never
receive
me
but
with
something
of
his
old
merry
boyish
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
heaven
,
my
dear
little
woman
,
"
say
he
,
"
how
do
you
come
here
?
 
<EOS>
who
could

quite

<EOS>
"

he

,
lenne
back
in

chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
poor
cousin

<EOS>
I
be
write

"
   
<EOS>
so
worn
and
haggard
as
he
look
,
even
in
the
fullness
of
his
handsome
youth
,
lean
back
in
his
chair
and
crush
the
closely
write
sheet
of
paper
in
his
hand
!
   
<EOS>
"
have
you
be
at
the
trouble
of
write
all
that

be
I
not

it
after
all

<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
my
dear
,
"
he
return
with
a
hopeless
gesture
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
read
it
in
the
whole
room

<EOS>
It
be
all
over
here

"
   
<EOS>
I
mildly
entreat
him
not
to
be
despondent
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
that
I
have
hear
by
chance
of
his
being
in
difficulty
and
have
come
to
consult
with
him
what
could
best
be
do

<EOS>
"
like
you

Esther

but
useless

and
so
not
like
you

say
he
with
a
melancholy
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
away
on
leave
this
day

should
have
be
go
in
another
hour

that
be
to
smooth
it
over

for
my
selling
out

well

bygone

make
the
round

Richard

I
urge
,

it
be
not
so
hopeless

that

<EOS>

Esther

he
return

it
be
indeed

<EOS>
I
be
just
so
near
disgrace
as
that
those
who
be
put
in
authority
over
me
(
as
the
catechism
go
)
would
far
rather
be
without
me

with
me

they
be
right

<EOS>
apart
from
debt
and
dun
and
all
such
drawback

I
be
not
fit

for

employment

I
have
no
care

no
mind

no
heart

no
soul

for
one
thing

<EOS>
why
,
if
this
bubble
have
not
break
now

"
he
say
,
tear
the
letter
he
have
write
into
fragment
and
moodily
cast
them
away
,
by
driblet
,
"
how
could
I
have
go
abroad

<EOS>
I
must
have
be
order
abroad

how

go

how

trust
even
vhole

<EOS>
I
suppose
he
know
by
my
face
what
I
be
about
to
say
,
but
he
catch
the
hand
I
have
lay
upon
his
arm

touch
my

lip
with
it

prevent
me
from
go
on

no

be
in

mood

I

it
best
not

increase
his
determination

if
anything
could
increase
it

by
oppose
him

I
take
out
Ada

in

He

after

finish
and
have
fold
it
up

stand
there
for
some
minute
with
the
letter
in

<EOS>
when
he
come
back
to
his

I
see
tear
in
his
eye

<EOS>
"
of
course

Esther

<EOS>
He
speak
in

softened
voice

he
ask
me

the
little
inheritance

certain
of
so
soon

just
as
little
and
as
much
as
I
have
waste

and
beg
and
pray
me
to
take
it
,
set
myself
right
with

<EOS>
He
go
back
to
the
window
,
and
lay
his
arm
across
it
,
lean
his
head
down
on
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
It
greatly
affect
me
to
see
him
so
,
but
I
hope
he
may
become
more
yielding
,
and
I
remain
silent

<EOS>
My
experience
be
very
limited

I
be
not

for

himself
out
of
this
emotion

this
generous

<EOS>
"
Richard

I
cry
out
,
rise
hastily
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
hear
you
say
such
shameful
word

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
angry
with
him
indeed
,
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
,
but
it
only
last
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
see
his
wear
young
face
look
at
me
as
if
he
be
sorry

I
put
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
say
,
"
if

do
not

a
tone

!
"
   
<EOS>
He
blame
himself
exceedingly
and
tell
me
in
the
most
generous
manner
that
he
have
be
very
wrong
and
that
he
beg
my
pardon
a
thousand
time

<EOS>
at
that
I
laugh
,
but
tremble
a
little
too

for
I
be
rather

after

so
fiery

<EOS>
"

down

besides

I
have
letter

would

I
have
do
with

it
be
some
satisfaction

Ada

God

<EOS>
His
sanguine
hope
be
rise
within
him
and
light
up
his
feature
,

they
make
his
face
more
sad
to
me

it
have
be
before

"
<EOS>
no
,
no
!

cry
Richard
exultingly

<EOS>
"
if
every
farthing
of
Ada

little
fortune
be
mine

no

me
in
what
I

not

for
,
can
take
no

be
weary
of

It
should
be
devoted

what
promise

should

<EOS>
I
shall
now
have
only
one
thing
on

Vholes

I
will
work
it

I
shall
not

without

free
of

shall
be
able

compound
with
some
small
usurer
who
will
hear
of
nothing

their
bond
now

Vholes
say
so

I
should
have
a
balance
in
my
favour

that
would
swell
it

come
,
come
!
 
<EOS>
You
shall
carry
a
letter
to
Ada
from
me
,
Esther
,
and
you
must
both
of
you
be
more
hopeful
of
me

not
believe
that
I
be
quite
cast
away
just
yet
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
will
not
repeat
what
I
say
to
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
be
tiresome
,
and
nobody
be
to
suppose
for
a
moment
that
it
be
at
all
wise
.
 
<EOS>
It
only
come
from
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
He
hear
it
patiently
and
feelingly
,
but
I
see
that
on
the
two
subject
he
have
reserve
it
be
at
present
hopeless
to
make
any
representation
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
too
,
and
have
experience
in
this
very
interview
,
the
sense
of
my
guardian
's
remark
that
it
be
even
more
mischievous
to
use
persuasion
with
him
than
to
leave
him
as
he
be
.
   
<EOS>
therefore
I
be
drive
at
last
to
ask
Richard
if
he
would
mind
convince
me
that
it
really
be
all
over
there
,
as
he
have
say
,
and
that
it
be
not
his
mere
impression
.
 
<EOS>
He
show
me
without
hesitation
a
correspondence
make
it
quite
plain
that
his
retirement
be
arrange
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
,
from
what
he
tell
me
,
that
Mr
Vholes
have
copy
of
these
paper
and
have
be
in
consultation
with
him
throughout
.
 
<EOS>
beyond
ascertain
this
,
and
have
be
the
bearer
of
Ada
's
letter
,
and
be
(
as
I
be
go
to
be
)
<EOS>
Richard
's
companion
back
to
London
<EOS>
,
I
have
do
no
good
by
come
down
.
<EOS>
admit
this
to
myself
with
a
reluctant
heart
,
I
say
I
would
return
to
the
hotel
and
wait
until
he
join
me
there
,
so
he
throw
a
cloak
over
his
shoulder
and
see
me
to
the
gate
,
and
Charley
<EOS>
and
I
go
back
along
the
beach
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
concourse
of
people
in
one
spot
,
surround
some
naval
officer
who
be
land
from
a
boat
,
and
press
about
them
with
unusual
interest
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
to
Charley
this
would
be
one
of
the
great
Indiaman
's
boat
now
,
and
we
stop
to
look
.
   
<EOS>
the
gentleman
come
slowly
up
from
the
waterside
,
speak
good
-
humouredly
to
each
other
and
to
the
people
around
and
glance
about
them
as
if
they
be
glad
to
be
in
England
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Charley
,
Charley
,
"
say
I
,
"
come
away
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
I
hurry
on
so
swiftly
that
my
little
maid
be
surprised
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
we
be
shut
up
in
our
cabin
-
room
<EOS>
and
I
have
have
time
to
take
breath
that
I
begin
to
think
why
I
have
make
such
haste
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
of
the
sunburnt
face
I
have
recognize
Mr
Allan
Woodcourt
,
and
I
have
be
afraid
of
his
recognize
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
unwilling
that
he
should
see
my
alter
look
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
take
by
surprise
,
and
my
courage
have
quite
fail
me
.
   
<EOS>
but
I
know
this
would
not
do
,
and
<EOS>
I
now
say
to
myself
,
"
My
dear
,
there
be
no
reason
<EOS>
---
there
be
and
there
can
be
no
reason
at
all
---
why
it
should
be
bad
for
you
now
than
it
ever
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
what
you
be
last
month
,
you
be
to
-
day
;
you
be
no
bad
,
you
be
no
well
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
not
your
resolution
;
call
it
up
,
Esther
,
call
it
up
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
in
a
great
tremble
---
with
running
---
and
<EOS>
at
first
be
quite
unable
to
calm
myself
;
but
I
get
well
,
and
I
be
very
glad
to
know
it
.
   
<EOS>
the
party
come
to
the
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
them
speak
on
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
it
be
the
same
gentleman
because
I
know
their
voice
again
---
<EOS>
I
mean
I
know
Mr
Woodcourt
's
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
still
have
be
a
great
relief
to
me
to
have
go
away
without
make
myself
know
,
but
I
be
determine
not
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
my
dear
,
no
.
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
untie
my
bonnet
and
put
my
veil
half
up
---
<EOS>
I
think
I
mean
half
down
,
but
it
matter
very
little
---
and
write
on
one
of
my
card
that
I
happen
to
be
there
with
Mr
Richard
Carstone
,
and
I
send
it
in
to
Mr
Woodcourt
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
be
rejoice
to
be
by
chance
among
the
first
to
welcome
him
home
to
England
.
<EOS>
and
I
see
that
he
be
very
sorry
for
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
be
in
shipwreck
and
peril
since
you
leave
us
,
Mr
Woodcourt
,
"
say
I
,
"
but
we
can
hardly
call
that
a
misfortune
which
enable
you
to
be
so
useful
and
so
brave
.
 
<EOS>
We
read
of
it
with
the
true
interest
.
 
<EOS>
It
first
come
to
my
knowledge
through
your
old
patient
,
poor
Miss
Flite
,
when
I
be
recover
from
my
severe
illness
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
little
Miss
Flite
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
live
the
same
life
yet
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
just
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
so
comfortable
with
myself
now
as
not
to
mind
the
veil
and
to
be
able
to
put
it
aside
.
   
<EOS>
"
Her
gratitude
to
you
,
Mr
Woodcourt
,
be
delightful
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
most
affectionate
creature
,
as
I
have
reason
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
---
you
have
find
her
so
?
<EOS>
"
he
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
be
glad
of
that
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
so
very
sorry
for
me
that
he
could
scarcely
speak
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
"
say
I
,
"
that
I
be
deeply
touch
by
her
sympathy
and
pleasure
at
the
time
I
have
refer
to
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
grieve
to
hear
that
you
have
be
very
ill
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
ill
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
but
you
have
quite
recover
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
quite
recover
my
health
and
my
cheerfulness
,
"
say
I.
<EOS>
"
You
know
how
good
my
guardian
be
and
what
a
happy
life
we
lead
,
and
I
have
everything
to
be
thankful
for
and
nothing
in
the
world
to
desire
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
he
have
great
commiseration
for
me
than
I
have
ever
have
for
myself
.
 
<EOS>
It
inspire
me
with
new
fortitude
and
new
calmness
to
find
that
it
be
I
who
be
under
the
necessity
of
reassure
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
speak
to
him
of
his
voyage
out
and
home
,
and
of
his
future
plan
,
and
of
his
probable
return
to
India
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
that
be
very
doubtful
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
find
himself
more
favour
by
fortune
there
than
here
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
go
out
a
poor
ship
's
surgeon
and
have
come
home
nothing
well
.
 
<EOS>
while
we
be
talk
,
and
when
I
be
glad
to
believe
that
I
have
alleviate
(
if
I
may
use
such
a
term
)
<EOS>
the
shock
he
have
have
in
see
me
,
Richard
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
hear
downstairs
who
be
with
me
,
and
they
meet
with
cordial
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
I
see
that
after
their
first
greeting
be
over
,
and
when
they
speak
of
Richard
's
career
,
Mr
Woodcourt
have
a
perception
that
all
be
not
go
well
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
frequently
glance
at
his
face
as
if
there
be
something
in
it
that
give
him
pain
,
and
more
than
once
he
look
towards
me
as
though
he
seek
to
ascertain
whether
I
know
what
the
truth
be
.
 
<EOS>
yet
Richard
be
in
one
of
his
sanguine
state
and
in
good
spirit
and
be
thoroughly
pleased
to
see
Mr
Woodcourt
again
,
whom
he
have
always
like
.
   
<EOS>
Richard
propose
that
we
all
should
go
to
London
together
;
but
Mr
Woodcourt
,
have
to
remain
by
his
ship
a
little
longer
,
could
not
join
us
.
 
<EOS>
He
dine
with
us
,
however
,
at
an
early
hour
,
and
become
so
much
more
like
what
he
use
to
be
that
I
be
still
more
at
peace
to
think
I
have
be
able
to
soften
his
regret
.
 
<EOS>
yet
his
mind
be
not
relieve
of
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
coach
be
almost
ready
and
Richard
run
down
to
look
after
his
luggage
,
he
speak
to
me
about
him
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
not
sure
that
I
have
a
right
to
lay
his
whole
story
open
,
but
I
refer
in
a
few
word
to
his
estrangement
from
Mr
Jarndyce
and
to
his
be
entangle
in
the
ill
-
fate
Chancery
suit
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Woodcourt
listen
with
interest
and
express
his
regret
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
observe
him
rather
closely
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
do
you
think
him
so
changed
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
be
change
,
"
he
return
,
shake
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
I

his

there

infection

contagion
somewhere

It
shall
pollute

this

the
choice
stream
(
in
which
chemist
on
analysis
would
find
the
genuine
nobility
)
of

its
retribution

It

youth
whose
face
be
hollow
and
whose
eye
have
an
emaciate
glare

<EOS>
He
be
so
intent
on
get
along
unseen
that
even
the
apparition
of
a
stranger
in
whole
garment
do
not
tempt
him
to
look
back
.
 
<EOS>
He
shade
his
face
with
his
ragged
elbow
as
he
pass
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
,
and
go
shrink
and
creep
on
with
his
anxious
hand
before
him

his
shapeless

hang
in
shred

it

They
look
,
in
colour

like
a
bundle

long

<EOS>
Allan
Woodcourt
pause
to
look
after
him
and
note
all
this
,
with
a
shadowy
belief
that
he
have
see
the
boy
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
not
recall
how
or
where
,
but
there
be
some
association
in
his
mind
with
such
a
form
.
 
<EOS>
He
imagine
that
he
must
have
see
it
in
some
hospital
or
refuge
,
still

can
not
make
out
why
it
come
with
any
special
force
on

<EOS>
He
be
gradually
emerge
from
Tom

all
-
Alone
be
in
the
morning
light
,
think
about
it
,
when
he
hear
run
foot
behind
him
,
and
look
round
,
see
the
boy
scour
towards
him
at
great
speed
,
follow
by
the
woman

<EOS>
"
stop
him

cry
the

almost

"

"
   
<EOS>
He
dart
across
the
road
into
the
boy

path
,
but
the
boy
be
quick
than
he
,
make
a
curve
,
duck
,
dive
under
his
hand
,
come
up
half
-
a
-
dozen
yard
beyond
him
,
and
scour
away
again
.

Allan

that

follow
in
chase
and
run
so
hard
that
he
run
the
boy
down
a
dozen
time
,
but
each
time
he
repeat
the
curve
,
the
duck
,
the
dive
,
and
scour
away
again
.
 
<EOS>
to
strike
at
him
on
any
of
these
occasion
would
be
to
fell
and
disable
him
,
but
the
pursuer
can
not
resolve
to
do
that
,
and
so
the
grimly
ridiculous
pursuit
continue
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
the

pressed

take
to
a
narrow

Jo
suddenly
come
out

glance
up

ten
foot
at

at

discover
some
real

bewildering

He
patiently
await
an

Chapter

<EOS>
Jo
's
Will
 
<EOS>
as
Allan
Woodcourt
and
Jo
proceed
along
the
street
where
the
high
church
spire
and
the
distance
be
so
near
and
clear
in
the
morning
light
that
the
city
itself
seem
renew
by
rest
,
Allan
revolve
in
his
mind
<EOS>
how
and
where
he
shall
bestow
his
companion
.
<EOS>
"
It
surely
be
a
strange
fact
,
"
he
consider
,
"
that
in
the
heart
of
a
civilized
world
this
creature
in
human
form
should
be
more
difficult
to
dispose
of
than
an
unowned
dog
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
none
the
less
a
fact
because
of
its
strangeness
,
and
the
difficulty
remain
.
   
<EOS>
at
first
he
look
behind
him
often
to
assure
himself
that
Jo
be
still
really
follow
.
 
<EOS>
but
look
where
he
will
,
he
still
behold
him
close
to
the
opposite
house
,
make
his
way
with
his
wary
hand
from
brick
to
brick
and
from
door
to
door
,
and
often
,
as
he
creep
along
,
glance
over
at
him
watchfully
.
 
<EOS>
soon
satisfy
that
the
last
thing
in
his
thought
be
to
give
him
the
slip
,
Allan
go
on
,
consider
with
a
less
divided
attention
what
he
shall
do
.
   
<EOS>
a
breakfast
-
stall
at
a
street
-
corner
suggest
the
first
thing
to
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
stop
there
,
look
round
,
and
beckon
Jo
.
 
<EOS>
Jo
crosse
and
come
halt
and
shuffle
up
,
slowly
scooping
the
knuckle
of
his
right
hand
round
and
round
in
the
hollowed
palm
of
his
left
,
knead
dirt
with
a
natural
pestle
and
mortar
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
a
dainty
repast
to
Jo
be
then
set
before
him
,
and
he
begin
to
gulp
the
coffee
and
to
gnaw
the
bread
and
butter
,
look
anxiously
about
him
in
all
direction
as
he
eat
and
drink
,
like
a
scared
animal
.
   
<EOS>
but
he
be
so
sick
and
miserable
that
even
hunger
have
abandon
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
be
amost
a
-
starvin
,
sir
,
"
say
Jo
,
soon
put
down
his
food
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
know
nothink
---
not
even
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
for
eat
wittle
nor
yet
for
drink
on
'
em
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
Jo
stand
shiver
and
look
at
the
breakfast
wonderingly
.
   
<EOS>
Allan
Woodcourt
lay
his
hand
upon
his
pulse
and
on
his
chest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
draw
breath
,
Jo
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
draw
,
"
say
Jo
,
"
as
heavy
as
a
cart
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
may
add
,
"
<EOS>
and
rattle
like
it
,
"
but
<EOS>
he
only
mutter
,
"
I
be
a
-
move
on
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Allan
look
about
for
an
apothecary
's
shop
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
none
at
hand
,
but
a
tavern
do
as
well
or
well
.
 
<EOS>
He
obtain
a
little
measure
of
wine
and
give
the
lad
a
portion
of
it
very
carefully
.
 
<EOS>
He
begin
to
revive
almost
as
soon
as
it
pass
his
lip
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
may
repeat
that
dose
,
Jo
,
"
observe
Allan
after
watch
him
with
his
attentive
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
so
!
 
<EOS>
now
we
will
take
five
minute
'
rest
,
and
then
go
on
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
leave
the
boy
sit
on
the
bench
of
the
breakfast
-
stall
,
with
his
back
against
an
iron
railing
,
Allan
Woodcourt
pace
up
and
down
in
the
early
sunshine
,
cast
an
occasional
look
towards
him
without
appear
to
watch
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
require
no
discernment
to
perceive
that
he
be
warm
and
refresh
.
 
<EOS>
if
a
face
so
shaded
can
brighten
,
his
face
brighten
somewhat
;
and
by
little
and
little
he
eat
the
slice
of
bread
he
have
so
hopelessly
lay
down
.
 
<EOS>
observant
of
these
sign
of
improvement
,
Allan
engage
him
in
conversation
and
elicit
to
his
no
small
wonder
the
adventure
of
the
lady
in
the
veil
,
with
all
its
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
Jo
slowly
munch
as
he
slowly
tell
it
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
finish
his
story
and
his
bread
,
they
go
on
again
.
   
<EOS>
intend
to
refer
his
difficulty
in
find
a
temporary
place
of
refuge
for
the
boy
to
his
old
patient
,
zealous
little
Miss
Flite
,
Allan
lead
the
way
to
the
court
where
he
and
Jo
first
foregather
.
 
<EOS>
but
all
be
change
at
the
rag
and
bottle
shop
;
Miss
Flite
no
long
lodge
there
;
it
be
shut
up
;
and
a
hard
-
feature
female
,
much
obscure
by
dust
,
whose
age
be
a
problem
,
but
who
be
indeed
no
other
than
the
interesting
Judy
,
be
tart
and
spare
in
her
reply
.
 
<EOS>
these
suffice
,
however
,
to
inform
the
visitor
that
Miss
Flite
and
her
bird
be
domicile
with
a
Mrs
Blinder
,
in
Bell
Yard
,
he
repair
to
that
neighbouring
place
,
where
Miss
Flite
(
who
rise
early
that
she
may
be
punctual
at
the
divan
of
justice
hold
by
her
excellent
friend
the
Chancellor
)
come
run
downstairs
with
tear
of
welcome
and
with
open
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
physician
!
<EOS>
"
cry
Miss
Flite
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
meritorious
,
distinguished
,
honourable
officer
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
use
some
odd
expression
,
but
be
as
cordial
and
full
of
heart
as
sanity
itself
can
be
---
more
so
than
it
often
be
.
 
<EOS>
Allan
,
very
patient
with
her
,
wait
until
she
have
no
more
rapture
to
express
,
then
point
out
Jo
,
tremble
in
a
doorway
,
and
tell
her
how
he
come
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
where
can
I
lodge
him
hereabouts
for
the
present
?
 
<EOS>
now
,
you
have
a
fund
of
knowledge
and
good
sense
and
can
advise
me
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Flite
,
mighty
proud
of
the
compliment
,
set
herself
to
consider
;
but
it
be
long
before
a
bright
thought
occur
to
her
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Blinder
be
entirely
let
,
and
she
herself
occupy
poor
Gridley
's
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gridley
!
<EOS>
"
exclaim
Miss
Flite
,
clap
her
hand
after
a
twentieth
repetition
of
this
remark
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gridley
!
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
of
course
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
physician
!
 
<EOS>
General
George
will
help
us
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
hopeless
to
ask
for
any
information
about
General
George
,
and
would
be
,
though
Miss
Flite
have
not
akeady
run
upstairs
to
put
on
her
pinch
bonnet
and
her
poor
little
shawl
and
to
arm
herself
with
her
reticule
of
document
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
she
inform
her
physician
in
her
disjointed
manner
on
come
down
in
full
array
that
General
George
,
whom
she
often
call
upon
,
know
her
dear
Fitz
Jarndyce
and
take
a
great
interest
in
all
connect
with
her
,
Allan
be
induce
to
think
that
they
may
be
in
the
right
way
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
tell
Jo
,
for
his
encouragement
,
that
this
walk
about
will
soon
be
over
now
;
and
they
repair
to
the
general
's
.
 
<EOS>
fortunately
it
be
not
far
.
   
<EOS>
from
the
exterior
of
George
's
Shooting
Gallery
,
and
the
long
entry
,
and
the
bare
perspective
beyond
it
,
Allan
Woodcourt
augur
well
.
<EOS>
He
also
descry
promise
in
the
figure
of
Mr
George
himself
,
stride
towards
them
in
his
mornmg
exercise
with
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
,
no
stock
on
,
and
his
muscular
arm
,
develop
by
broadsword
and
dumbbell
,
weightily
assert
themselves
through
his
light
shirt
-
sleeve
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
servant
,
sir
,
"
say
Mr
George
with
a
military
salute
.
 
<EOS>
good
-
humouredly
smile
all
over
his
broad
forehead
up
into
his
crisp
hair
,
he
then
defer
to
Miss
Flite
,
as
,
with
great
stateliness
,
and
at
some
length
,
she
perform
the
courtly
ceremony
of
presentation
.
<EOS>
He
wind
it
up
with
another
"
Your
servant
,
sir
!
"
and
another
salute
.
   
<EOS>
"
excuse
me
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
a
sailor
,
I
believe
?
<EOS>
"
say
Mr
George
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
proud
to
find
I
have
the
air
of
one
,
"
return
Allan
;
"
but
I
be
only
a
sea
-
go
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
think
you
be
a
regular
blue
-
jacket
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
Allan
hope
Mr
George
will
forgive
his
intrusion
the
more
readily
on
that
account
,
and
particularly
that
he
will
not
lay
aside
his
pipe
,
which
,
in
his
politeness
,
he
have
testifle
some
intention
of
do
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
good
,
sir
,
"
return
the
trooper
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
I
know
by
experience
that
it
be
not
disagreeable
to
Miss
Flite
,
and
since
it
be
equally
agreeable
to
yourself
---
"
and
finish
the
sentence
by
put
it
between
his
lip
again
.
 
<EOS>
Allan
proceed
to
tell
him
all
he
know
about
Jo
,
unto
which
the
trooper
listen
with
a
grave
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
that
be
the
lad
<EOS>
,
sir
,
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquire
,
look
along
the
entry
to
where
Jo
stand
stare
up
at
the
great
letter
on
the
whitewashed
front
,
which
have
no
meaning
in
his
eye
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
he
,
"
say
Allan
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
,
Mr
George
,
I
be
in
this
difficulty
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
unwilling
to
place
him
in
a
hospital
,
even
if
I
could
procure
him
immediate
admission
,
because
I
foresee
that
he
would
not
stay
there
many
hour
if
he
could
be
so
much
as
get
there
.
 
<EOS>
the
same
objection
apply
to
a
workhouse
,
suppose
I
have
the
patience
to
be
evade
and
shirk
,
and
hand
about
from
post
to
pillar
in
try
to
get
him
into
one
,
which
be
a
system
that
I
do
not
take
kindly
to
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
man
do
,
sir
,
"
return
Mr
George
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
convinced
that
he
would
not
remain
in
either
place
,
because
he
be
possess
by
an
extraordinary
terror
of
this
person
who
order
him
to
keep
out
of
the
way
;
in
his
ignorance
,
he
believe
this
person
to
be
everywhere
,
and
cognizant
of
everything
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ask
your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
say
Mr
George
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
you
have
not
mention
that
party
's
name

it
a
secret

sir
?

the
boy
make
it
one

his

the
trooper
after
blow
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
and
square
his
chest
,
"
and
the
boy
be
so
far
correct
that
he
undoubtedly
be
a

rum
customer
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
George
smoke
with
a
profound
meaning
after
this
and
survey
Miss
Flite
in
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
I
wish
Mr
Jarndyce
and
Miss
Summerson
at
least
to
know
that
this
Jo
,
who
tell
so
strange
a
story
,
have
reappear
,
and
to
have
it
in
their
power
to
speak
with
him
if
they
should
desire
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
therefore
I
want
to
get
him
,
for
the
present
moment
,
into
any
poor
lodging
keep
by
decent
people
where
he
would
be
admit
.
 
<EOS>
decent
people
and
Jo
,
Mr
George
,
"
say
Allan
,
follow
the
direction
of
the
trooper
's
eye
along
the
entry
,
"
have
not
be
much
acquaint
,
as
you
see

<EOS>
hence
the
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
happen
to
know
any
one
in
this
neighbourhood
who
would
receive
him
for
a
while
on
my
pay
for
him
beforehand
?
"
   
<EOS>
as
he
put
the
question
,
he
become
aware
of
a
dirty
-
faced
little
man
stand
at
the
trooper
's
elbow
and
look
up
,
with
an
oddly
twist
figure
and
countenance
,
into
the
trooper
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
few
more
puff
at
his
pipe
,
the
trooper
look
down
askant
at
the
little
man
,
and
the
little
man
wink
up
at
the
trooper
.
   
<EOS>
"
well

My

He

slowly
rub
his
rusty
leg
up

down

up

down

up

down

"
I

indeed

<EOS>
"
yes

decidedly

I

<EOS>
I
consider
it
a
departure
from

<EOS>
It
put
us
in
a
new
position

Lady

I

myself
under
the
necessity

"
   
<EOS>
He
stop
in
his
rubbing
and
look
at
her
,
with
his
hand
on
his
knee
.
 
<EOS>
imperturbable
and
unchangeable
as
he
be
,
there
be
still
an
indefinable
freedom
in
his
manner
which
be
new
and
which
do
not
escape
this
woman
's
observation
.
   
<EOS>
"

I
object
to

<EOS>
I
consider

dangerous
proceeding

for

It

once

always

like

there

a

come
people
to
clean
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
and
either
the
Roman
have
some
new
meaning
in
him
,
not
express
before
,
or
the
foremost
of
them
go
wild
,
for
look
up
at
his
outstretched

look
down
at
what

below
it

that

<EOS>
the

look

there

what
do
it

<EOS>
no

people
unaccustomed

enter

and
tread
softly

heavily
,
carry
a
weight
into
the
bedroom
and
lie
it
down

<EOS>
there
be
whisper

wonder
all
day
,
strict
search

careful

careful
noting

all

look

"

"
   
<EOS>
He
be
point
at
a

nearly
full

a

two

He

at

almost
cover

<EOS>
these
object
lie
directly
within

<EOS>
an
excited
imagination
may
suppose
that
there
be
something
in
them
so
terrific
as
to
drive
the
rest
of
the
composition
,
not
only
the
attendant
big

legged
boy
,
but
the
cloud
and
flower
and
pillar
too
---
in
short
,
the
very
body
and
soul
of
Allegory
,
and
all
the
brain
it
have
<EOS>
---
stark
mad
.
 
<EOS>
It
happen
surely
that
every
one
who
come
into
the
darkened
room

look
at
these
thing
look
up
at
the
Roman
and
that
he

invest
in
all
eye
with
mystery
and
awe

as
if
he

a
paralysed
dumb
witness

<EOS>
so
it
shall
happen
surely
,
through
many
year
to
come
,
that
ghostly
story
shall
be
tell
of
the
stain
upon
the
floor
,
so
easy
to
be
cover
,
so
hard
to
be
get
out
,
and
that
the
Roman
,
point
from
the
ceiling
shall
point
,
so
long
as
dust
and
damp
and
spider
spare
him
,
with
far
great
significance
than
he
ever
have
in
Mr
Tulkinghorn

and
with
a
deadly
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
for
Mr
Tulkinghorn
's
time
be
over
for
evermore
,
and
the
Roman
point
at
the
murderous
hand
uplift
against
his
life
,
and
point
helplessly
at
him
,
from
night
to
morning
,
lie

shoot
through
the
heart

It

<EOS>
Mr

merely
distinguish
that
epoch
in
the
musical
instrument
business
by
kiss
the
child
with
an
extra
smack
before
breakfast
,
smoke
an
additional
pipe
after
dinner
,
and
wonder
towards
evening
what
his
poor
old
mother
be
think
about
it
---
a
subject
of
infinite
speculation
,
and
render
so
by
his

<EOS>
some
man
rarely

book
of
their

Mr

if
I

<EOS>
those

be
keep
with
some
mark
of
distinction
,
but
they
rarely
overleap
the
bound
of
happy
return

a
pudding

<EOS>
on
young
Woolwich

last
birthday
,
Mr

certainly
do
,
after
observe
on
his
growth

advancement
,
proceed
,
in
a
moment
of
profound
reflection
on
the
change
work
by
time
,
to
examine
him
in
the
catechism
,
accomplish
with
extreme
accuracy
the
question
number
one

"
what
be
your
name
?
"
<EOS>
and
"
who
give
you
that
name
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
there
fail
in
the
exact
precision
of
his
memory
and
substituting
for
number
three
the
question

<EOS>
and
how
do
you
like
that
name

"
<EOS>
which
he
propound
with
a
sense
of
its
importance
,
in
itself
so
edify

improve
as

quite
an
orthodox

<EOS>
this

Their

a
clattering

a
whisking

if
anything
can
more
closely

Esther
's
Narrative
 
<EOS>
It
happen
that
when
I
come
home
from
Deal
I
find
a
note
from
Caddy
Jellyby
(
as
we
always
continue
to
call
her
)
,
inform
me
that
her
health
,
which
have
be
for
some
time
very
delicate
,
be
bad
and
that
she
would
be
more
glad
than
she
could
tell
me
if
I
would
go
to
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
note
of
a
few
line
,
write
from
the
couch
on
which
she
lie
and
enclose
to
me
in
another
from
her
husband
,
in
which
he
second
her
entreaty
with
much
solicitude
.
<EOS>
Caddy
be
now
the
mother
,
and
I
the
godmother
,
of
such
a
poor
little
baby
---
such
a
tiny
old
-
faced
mite
,
with
a
countenance
that
seem
to
be
scarcely
anything
but
cap
-
border
,
and
a
little
lean
,
long
-
finger
hand
,
always
clench
under
its
chin
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
lie
in
this
attitude
all
day
,
with
its
bright
speck
of
eye
open
,
wonder
(
as
I
use
to
imagine
)
how
it
come
to
be
so
small
and
weak
.
 
<EOS>
whenever
it
be
move
it
cry
,
but
at
all
other
time
it
be
so
patient
that
the
sole
desire
of
its
life
appear
to
be
to
lie
quiet
and
think
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
curious
little
dark
vein
in
its
face
and
curious
little
dark
mark
under
its
eye
like
faint
remembrance
of
poor
Caddy
's
inky
day
,
and
altogether
,
to
those
who
be
not
use
to
it
,
it
be
quite
a
piteous
little
sight
.
   
<EOS>
but
it
be
enough
for
Caddy
that
she
be
use
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
project
with
which
she
beguile
her
illness
,
for
little
Esther
's
education
,
and
little
Esther
's
marriage
,
and
even
for
her
own
old
age
as
the
grandmother
of
little
Esther
's
little
Esthers
,
be
so
prettily
expressive
of
devotion
to
this
pride
of
her
life
that
I
should
be
tempt
to
recall
some
of
them
but
for
the
timely
remembrance
that
I
be
get
on
irregularly
as
it
be
.
   
<EOS>
to
return
to
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
Caddy
have
a
superstition
about
me
which
have
be
strengthen
in
her
mind
ever
since
that
night
long
ago
when
she
have
lain
asleep
with
her
head
in
my
lap
.
 
<EOS>
She
almost
<EOS>
---
I
think
I
must
say
quite
---
believe
that
I
do
her
good
whenever
I
be
near
her
.
 
<EOS>
now
although
this
be
such
a
fancy
of
the
affectionate
girl
be
that
I
be
almost
ashamed
to
mention
it
,
still
it
may
have
all
the
force
of
a
fact
when
she
be
really
ill
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
I
set
off
to
Caddy
,
with
my
guardian
's
consent
,
post
-
haste
;
and
she
and
Prince
make
so
much
of
me
that
there
never
be
anything
like
it
.
   
<EOS>
next
day
I
go
again
to
sit
with
her
,
and
next
day
I
go
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
easy
journey
,
for
I
have
only
to
rise
a
little
earlier
in
the
morning
,
and
keep
my
account
,
and
attend
to
housekeeping
matter
before
leave
home
.
   
<EOS>
but
when
I
have
make
these
three
visit
,
my
guardian
say
to
me
,
on
my
return
at
night
,
"
now
,
little
woman
,
little
woman
,
this
will
never
do
.
 
<EOS>
constant
dropping
will
wear
away
a
stone
,
and
constant
coaching
will
wear
out
a
Dame
Durden
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
go
to
London
for
a
while
and
take
possession
of
our
old
lodging
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
not
for
me
,
dear
guardian
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
for
I
never
feel
tired
,
"
which
be
strictly
true
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
only
too
happy
to
be
in
such
request
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
me
then
,
"
return
my
guardian
,
"
or
for
Ada
,
or
for
both
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
somebody
's
birthday
to
-
morrow
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
truly
I
think
it
be
,
"
say
I
,
kiss
my
darling
,
who
would
be
twenty
-
one
to
-
morrow
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
observe
my
guardian
,
half
pleasantly
,
half
seriously
,
"
that
be
a
great
occasion
and
will
give
my
fair
cousin
some
necessary
business
to
transact
in
assertion
of
her
independence
,
and
will
make
London
a
more
convenient
place
for
all
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
so
to
London
we
will
go
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
settle
,
there
be
another
thing
---
how
have
you
leave
Caddy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
very
unwell
,
guardian
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
it
will
be
some
time
before
she
regain
her
health
and
strength
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
call
some
time
,
now
?
"
ask
my
guardian
thoughtfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
some
week
,
I
be
afraid
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
begin
to
walk
about
the
room
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
show
that
he
have
be
think
as
much
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
what
do
you
say
about
her
doctor
?
 
<EOS>
be
he
a
good
doctor
,
my
love
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
feel
oblige
to
confess
that
I
know
nothing
to
the
contrary
but
that
Prince
and
I
have
agree
only
that
evening
that
we
would
like
his
opinion
to
be
confirm
by
some
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
know
,
"
return
my
guardian
quickly
,
"
there
be
Woodcourt
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
have
not
mean
that
,
and
be
rather
take
by
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
moment
all
that
I
have
have
in
my
mind
in
connexion
with
Mr
Woodcourt
seem
to
come
back
and
confuse
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
object
to
him
,
little
woman
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
object
to
him
,
guardian
?
 
<EOS>
oh
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
and
you
do
not
think
the
patient
would
object
to
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
so
far
from
that
,
I
have
no
doubt
of
her
be
prepare
to
have
a
great
reliance
on
him
and
to
like
him
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
that
he
be
no
stranger
to
her
personally
,
for
she
have
see
him
often
in
his
kind
attendance
on
Miss
Flite
.
   
<EOS>
"
very
good
,
"
say
my
guardian
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
have
be
here
to
-
day
,
my
dear
,
and
<EOS>
I
will
see
him
about
it
to
-
morrow
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
feel
in
this
short
conversation
---
though
I
do
not
know
how
,
for
she
be
quiet
,
and
we
interchange
no
look
---
that
my
dear
girl
well
remember
how
merrily
she
have
clasp
me
round
the
waist
when
no
other
hand
than
Caddy
's
have
bring
me
the
little
parting
token
.
<EOS>
this
cause
me
to
feel
that
I
ought
to
tell
her
,
and
Caddy
too
,
that
I
be
go
to
be
the
mistress
of
Bleak
House
and
that
if
I
avoid
that
disclosure
any
longer
I
may
become
less
worthy
in
my
own
eye
of
its
master
's
love
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
when
we
go
upstairs
and
have
wait
listen
until
the
clock
strike
twelve
in
order
that
only
I
may
be
the
first
to
wish
my
darling
all
good
wish
on
her
birthday
and
to
take
her
to
my
heart
,
I
set
before
her
,
just
as
I
have
set
before
myself
,
the
goodness
and
honour
of
her
cousin
John
and
the
happy
life
that
be
in
store
for
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
if
ever
my
darling
be
fonder
of
me
at
one
time
than
another
in
all
our
intercourse
,
she
be
surely
fond
of
me
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
so
rejoice
to
know
it
<EOS>
and
so
comfort
by
the
sense
of
have
do
right
in
cast
this
last
idle
reservation
away
<EOS>
that
I
be
ten
time
happy
than
I
have
be
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
scarcely
think
it
a
reservation
a
few
hour
ago
,
but
now
that
it
be
go
I
feel
as
if
I
understand
its
nature
better
.
   
<EOS>
next
day
we
go
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
We
find
our
old
lodging
vacant
,
and
in
half
an
hour
be
quietly
establish
there
,
as
if
we
have
never
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Woodcourt
dine
with
us
to
celebrate
my
darling
's
birthday
,
<EOS>
and
we
be
as
pleasant
as
we
could
be
with
the
great
blank
among
us
that
Richard
's
absence
naturally
make
on
such
an
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
after
that
day
I
be
for
some
week
---
<EOS>
eight
or
nine
as
I
remember
---
very
much
with
Caddy
,
and
thus
it
fall
out
that
I
see
less
of
Ada
at
this
time
than
any
other
since
we
have
first
come
together
,
except
the
time
of
my
own
illness
.
 
<EOS>
She
often
come
to
Caddy
's
,
but
our
function
there
be
to
amuse
and
cheer
her
,
and
we
do
not
talk
in
our
usual
confidential
manner
.
 
<EOS>
whenever
I
go
home
at
night
we
be
together
,
but
Caddy
's
rest
be
break
by
pain
,
and
I
often
remain
to
nurse
her
.
   
<EOS>
with
her
husband
and
her
poor
little
mite
of
a
baby
to
love
and
their
home
to
strive
for
,
<EOS>
what
a
good
creature
<EOS>
Caddy
be
!
 
<EOS>
so
self
-
deny
,
so
uncomplaining
,
so
anxious
to
get
well
on
their
account
,
so
afraid
of
give
trouble
,
and
so
thoughtful
of
the
unassisted
labour
of
her
husband
and
the
comfort
of
old
Mr
Turveydrop
<EOS>
;
I
have
never
know
the
good
of
her
until
now
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
seem
so
curious
that
her
pale
face
and
helpless
figure
should
be
lie
there
day
after
day
where
dancing
be
the
business
of
life
,
where
the
kit
and
the
apprentice
begin
early
every
morning
in
the
ball
-
room
,
and
where
the
untidy
little
boy
waltz
by
himself
in
the
kitchen
all
the
afternoon
.
   
<EOS>
at
Caddy
's
request
I
take
the
supreme
direction
of
her
apartment
,
trim
it
up
,
and
push
her
,
couch
and
all
,
into
a
light
and
more
airy
and
more
cheerful
corner
than
she
have
yet
occupy
;
then
,
every
day
,
when
we
be
in
our
neatest
array
,
I
use
to
lay
my
small
small
namesake
in
her
arm
and
sit
down
to
chat
or
work
or
read
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
at
one
of
the
first
of
these
quiet
time
that
I
tell
Caddy
about
Bleak
House
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
other
visitor
besides
Ada
.
 
<EOS>
first
of
all
we
have
Prince
,
who
in
his
hurried
interval
of
teaching
use
to
come
softly
in
and
sit
softly
down
,
with
a
face
of
love
anxiety
for
Caddy
and
the
very
little
child
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
Caddy
's
condition
really
be
,
she
never
fail
to
declare
to
Prince
that
she
be
all
but
well
---
<EOS>
which
I
,
heaven
forgive
me
,
never
fail
to
confirm
.
 
<EOS>
this
would
put
Prince
in
such
good
spirit
that
he
would
sometimes
take
the
kit
from
his
pocket
and
play
a
chord
or
two
to
astonish
the
baby
,
which
I
never
know
it
to
do
in
the
least
degree
,
for
my
tiny
namesake
never
notice
it
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
then
there
be
Mrs
Jellyby
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
come
occasionally
,
with
her
usual
distraught
manner
,
and
sit
calmly
look
mile
beyond
her
grandchild
as
if
her
attention
be
absorb
by
a
young
Borrioboolan
on
its
native
shore
.
 
<EOS>
as
bright
-
eyed
as
ever
,
as
serene
,
and
as
untidy
,
she
would
say
,
"
well
,
Caddy
,
child
,
and
how
do
you
do
to
-
day
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
would
sit
amiably
smile
and
take
no
notice
of
the
reply
or
would
sweetly
glide
off
into
a
calculation
of
the
number
of
letter
she
have
lately
receive
and
answer
or
of
the
coffee
-
bear
power
of
Borrioboola
-
Gha
.
 
<EOS>
this
she
would
always
do
with
a
serene
contempt
for
our
limited
sphere
of
action
,
not
to
be
disguise
.
   
<EOS>
then
there
be
old
Mr
Turveydrop
,
who
be
from
morning
to
night
and
from
night
to
morning
the
subject
of
innumerable
precaution
.
<EOS>
if
the
baby
cry
,
it
be
nearly
stifle
lest
the
noise
should
make
him
uncomfortable
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
fire
want
stir
in
the
night
,
it
be
surreptitiously
do
lest
his
rest
should
be
break
.
 
<EOS>
if
Caddy
require
any
little
comfort
that
the
house
contain
,
she
first
carefully
discuss
whether
he
be
likely
to
require
it
too
.
 
<EOS>
in
return
for
this
consideration
he
would
come
into
the
room
once
a
day
,
all
but
bless
it
---
show
a
condescension
,
and
a
patronage
,
and
a
grace
of
manner
in
dispense
the
light
of
his
high
-
shoulder
presence
from
which
I
may
have
suppose
him
(
if
I
have
not
know
better
)
to
have
be
the
benefactor
of
Caddy
's
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
Caroline
,
"
he
would
say
,
make
the
near
approach
that
he
could
to
bend
over
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
tell
me
that
you
be
well
to
-
day
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
much
well
,
thank
you
,
Mr
Turveydrop
,
"
Caddy
would
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
delighted
!
 
<EOS>
Enchanted
!
 
<EOS>
and
our
dear
Miss
Summerson
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
not
qulte
prostrate
by
fatigue
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
here
he
would
crease
up
his
eyelid
and
kiss
his
finger
to
me
,
though
I
be
happy
to
say
he
have
cease
to
be
particular
in
his
attention
since
I
have
be
so
alter
.
   
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
,
"
I
would
assure
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Charming
!
 
<EOS>
We
must
take
care
of
our
dear
Caroline
,
Miss
Summerson
.
<EOS>
We
must
spare
nothing
that
will
restore
her
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
nourish
her
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Caroline
"
---
he
would
turn
to
his
daughter
-
in
-
law
with
infinite
generosity
and
protection
---
"
want
for
nothing
,
my
love
.
<EOS>
frame
a
wish
and
gratify
it
,
my
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
everything
this
house
contain
,
everything
my
room
contain
,
be
at
your
service
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
do
not
,
"
he
would
sometimes
add
in
a
burst
of
deportment
,
"
even
allow
my
simple
requirement
to
be
consider
if
they
should
at
any
time
interfere
with
your
own
,
my
Caroline
.
 
<EOS>
Your
necessity
be
great
than
mine
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
have
establish
such
a
long
prescriptive
right
to
this
deportment
(
his
son
's
inheritance
from
his
mother
)
that
I
several
time
know
both
Caddy
and
her
husband
to
be
melt
to
tear
by
these
affectionate
self
-
sacrifice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
my
dear
,
"
he
would
remonstrate
;
and
when
I
see
Caddy
's
thin
arm
about
his
fat
neck
as
he
say
it
,
I
would
be
melt
too
,
though
not
by
the
same
process
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
nay
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
promise
never
to
leave
ye
.
 
<EOS>
be
dutiful
and
affectionate
towards
me
,
and
I
ask
no
other
return
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
bless
ye
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
the
Park
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
would
take
the
air
there
presently
and
get
an
appetite
for
his
hotel
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
do
old
Mr
Turveydrop
<EOS>
no
wrong
,
<EOS>
but
I
never
see
any
well
trait
in
him
than
these
I
faithfully
record
,
except
that
he
certainly
conceive
a
liking
for
Peepy
and
would
take
the
child
out
walk
with
great
pomp
,
always
on
those
occasion
send
him
home
before
he
go
to
dinner
himself
,
and
occasionally
with
a
halfpenny
in
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
but
even
this
disinterestedness
be
attend
with
no
inconsiderable
cost
,
to
my
knowledge
,
for
before
Peepy
be
sufficiently
decorate
to
walk
hand
in
hand
with
the
professor
of
deportment
<EOS>
,
he
have
to
be
newly
dress
,
at
the
expense
of
Caddy
and
her
husband
,
from
top
to
toe
.
   
<EOS>
last
of
our
visitor
,
there
be
Mr
Jellyby
.
 
<EOS>
really
when
he
use
to
come
in
of
an
evening
,
and
ask
Caddy
in
his
meek
voice
how
she
be
,
and
then
sit
down
with
his
head
against
the
wall
,
and
make
no
attempt
to
say
anything
more
,
I
like
him
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
find
me
bustle
about
do
any
little
thing
,
he
sometimes
half
take
his
coat
off
,
as
if
with
an
intention
of
help
by
a
great
exertion
;
but
he
never
get
any
further
.
 
<EOS>
His
sole
occupation
be
to
sit
with
his
head
against
the
wall
,
look
hard
at
the
thoughtful
baby
;
and
I
could
not
quite
div
my
mind
of
a
fancy
that
they
understand
one
another
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
not
count
Mr
Woodcourt
among
our
visitor
because
he
be
now
Caddy
's
regular
attendant
.
 
<EOS>
She
soon
begin
to
improve
under
his
care
,
but
he
be
so
gentle
,
so
skilful
,
so
unwearying
in
the
pain
<EOS>
he
take
that
it
be
not
to
be
wonder
at
,
<EOS>
I
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
a
good
deal
of
Mr
Woodcourt
during
this
time
,
though
not
so
much
as
may
be
suppose
,
for
know
Caddy
to
be
safe
in
his
hand
,
I
often
slip
home
at
about
the
hour
when
he
be
expect
.
 
<EOS>
We
frequently
meet
,
notwithstanding
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
quite
reconcile
to
myself
now
,
but
I
still
feel
glad
to
think
that
he
be
sorry
for
me
,
and
he
still
be
sorry
for
me
<EOS>
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
He
help
Mr
Badger
in
his
professional
engagement
,
which
be
numerous
,
and
have
as
yet
no
settle
project
for
the
future
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
when
Caddy
begin
to
recover
that
I
begin
to
notice
a
change
in
my
dear
girl
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
how
it
first
present
itself
to
me
,
because
I
observe
it
in
many
slight
particular
which
be
nothing
in
themselves
and
only
become
something
when
they
be
piece
together
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
make
it
out
,
by
put
them
together
,
that
Ada
be
not
so
frankly
cheerful
with
me
as
she
use
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
Her
tenderness
for
me
be
as
loving
and
true
as
ever
;
I
do
not
for
a
moment
doubt
<EOS>
that
;
but
there
be
a
quiet
sorrow
about
her
which
she
do
not
confide
to
me
,
and
in
which
I
trace
some
hide
regret
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
I
could
not
understand
this
,
and
I
be
so
anxious
for
the
happiness
of
my
own
pet
that
it
cause
me
some
uneasiness
and
set
me
think
often
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
feel
sure
that
Ada
suppress
this
something
from
me
lest
it
should
make
me
unhappy
too
,
it
come
into
my
head
that
she
be
a
little
grieved
---
for
me
---
by
what
I
have
tell
her
about
Bleak
House
.
   
<EOS>
how
I
persuade
myself
that
this
be
likely
,
I
do
not
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
idea
that
there
be
any
selfish
reference
in
my
doing
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
grieve
for
myself
:
<EOS>
I
be
quite
contented
and
quite
happy
.
<EOS>
still
,
that
Ada
may
be
think
---
for
me
,
though
I
have
abandon
all
such
thought
---
of
what
once
be
,
but
be
now
all
change
,
seem
so
easy
to
believe
that
I
believe
it
.
   
<EOS>
what
could
I
do
to
reassure
my
darling
(
I
consider
then
)
and
show
her
that
I
have
no
such
feeling
?
 
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
I
could
only
be
as
brisk
and
busy
as
possible
,
and
that
I
have
try
to
be
all
along
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
Caddy
's
illness
have
certainly
interfere
,
more
or
less
,
with
my
home
duty
---
though
I
have
always
be
there
in
the
morning
to
make
my
guardian
's
breakfast
,
and
he
have
a
hundred
time
laugh
and
say
there
must
be
two
little
woman
,
for
his
little
woman
be
never
missing
---
<EOS>
I
resolve
to
be
doubly
diligent
and
gay
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
go
about
the
house
hum
all
the
tune
I
know
,
and
I
sit
work
and
work
in
a
desperate
manner
,
and
I
talk
and
talk
,
morning
,
noon
,
and
night
.
   
<EOS>
and
still
there
be
the
same
shade
between
me
and
my
darling
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
,
Dame
Trot
,
"
observe
my
guardian
,
shut
up
his
book
one
night
when
we
be
all
three
together
,
"
so
<EOS>
Woodcourt
have
restore
Caddy
Jellyby
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
life
again
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
say
;
"
and
to
be
repay
by
such
gratitude
as
her
be
to
be
make
rich
,
guardian
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
it
be
,
"
he
return
,
"
with
all
my
heart
.
"
   
<EOS>
so
do
I
too
,
for
that
matter
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
aye
!
<EOS>
We
would
make
him
as
rich
as
a
Jew
if
we
know
how
.
 
<EOS>
Would
we
not
,
little
woman
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
laugh
as
I
work
and
reply
that
I
be
not
sure
about
that
,
for
it
may
spoil
him
,
and
he
may
not
be
so
useful
,
and
there
may
be
many
who
could
ill
spare
him
.
 
<EOS>
as
Miss
Flite
,
and
Caddy
herself
,
and
many
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
true
,
"
say
my
guardian
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
forget
that
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
would
agree
to
make
him
rich
enough
to
live
,
I
suppose
?
 
<EOS>
Rich
enough
to
work
with
tolerable
peace
of
mind
?
 
<EOS>
Rich
enough
to
have
his
own
happy
home
and
his
own
household
god
---
and
household
goddess
,
too
,
perhaps
?
"
   
<EOS>
that
be
quite
another
thing
,
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
all
agree
in
that
.
   
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
,
"
say
my
guardian
.
 
<EOS>
"
all
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
regard
for
Woodcourt
,
a
high
esteem
for
him
;
and
I
have
be
sound
him
delicately
about
his
plan
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
difficult
to
offer
aid
to
an
independent
man
with
that
just
kind
of
pride
which
he
possess
.
<EOS>
and
yet
I
would
be
glad
to
do
it
if
I
may
or
if
I
know
how
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
half
inclined
for
another
voyage
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
appear
like
cast
such
a
man
away
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
may
open
a
new
world
to
him
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
it
may
,
little
woman
,
"
my
guardian
assent
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
if
he
expect
much
of
the
old
world
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
know
I
have
fancy
that
he
sometimes
feel
some
particular
disappointment
or
misfortune
encounter
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
hear
of
anything
of
that
sort
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
shake
my
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Humph
,
"
say
my
guardian
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
mistaken
,
I
dare
say
.
"
 
as
there
be
a
little
pause
here
,
which
I
think
,
for
my
dear
girl
's
satisfaction
,
have
better
be
fill
up
,
I
hum
an
air
as
I
work
which
be
a
favourite
with
my
guardian
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
do
you
think
Mr
Woodcourt
will
make
another
voyage
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
him
when
I
have
hum
it
quietly
all
through
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
quite
know
what
to
think
,
my
dear
,
but
I
should
say
it
be
likely
at
present
that
he
will
give
a
long
trip
to
another
country
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
he
will
take
the
good
wish
of
all
our
heart
with
him
wherever
he
go
,
"
say
I
;
"
and
though
they
be
not
rich
,
he
will
never
be
the
poor
for
them
,
guardian
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
never
,
little
woman
,
"
he
reply
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
sit
in
my
usual
place
,
which
be
now
beside
my
guardian
's
chair
.
 
<EOS>
that
have
not
be
my
usual
place
before
the
letter
,
but
it
be
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
look
up
to
Ada
,
who
be
sit
opposite
,
and
I
see
,
as
she
look
at
me
,
that
her
eye
be
fill
with
tear
and
that
tear
be
fall
down
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
have
only
to
be
placid
and
merry
once
for
all
to
undeceive
my
dear
and
set
her
love
heart
at
rest
.
 
<EOS>
I
really
be
so
,
and
I
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
be
myself
.
   
<EOS>
so
I
make
my
sweet
girl
lean
upon
my
shoulder
---
<EOS>
how
little
think
what
be
heavy
on
her
mind
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
I
say
she
be
not
quite
well
,
and
put
my
arm
about
her
,
and
take
her
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
be
in
our
own
room
,
and
when
she
may
perhaps
have
tell
me
what
I
be
so
unprepared
to
hear
,
I
give
her
no
encouragement
to
confide
in
me
;
I
never
think
she
stand
in
need
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
my
dear
good
Esther
,
"
say
Ada
,
"
if
I
could
only
make
up
my
mind
to
speak
to
you
and
my
cousin
John
when
you
be
together
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
my
love
!
<EOS>
"
I
remonstrate
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ada
,
why
should
you
not
speak
to
us
!
"
   
<EOS>
Ada
only
drop
her
head
and
press
me
closer
to
her
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
surely
do
not
forget
,
my
beauty
,
"
say
I
,
smile
,
"
what
quiet
,
old
-
fashioned
people
we
be
and
how
I
have
settle
down
to
be
the
discreet
of
dame
?
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
forget
how
happily
and
peacefully
my
life
be
all
mark
out
for
me
,
and
by
whom
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
certain
that
you
do
not
forget
by
what
a
noble
character
,
Ada
.
 
<EOS>
that
can
never
be

"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
never
,
Esther

"
   
<EOS>
"
why
then
,
my
dear
,
"
say
I
,
"
there
can
be
nothing
amiss
---
and
why
should
you
not
speak
to
us
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
nothing
amiss
,
Esther
?
<EOS>
"
return
Ada
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
when
I
think
of
all
these
year
,
and
of
his
fatherly
care
and
kindness
,
and
of
the
old
relation
among
us
,
and
of
you
,
what
shall
I
do
,
what
shall
I
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
look
at
my
child
in
some
wonder
,
but
I
think
it
better
not
to
answer
otherwise
than
by
cheer
her
,
and
so
I
turn
off
into
many
little
recollection
of
our
life
together
and
prevent
her
from
say
more
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
lie
down
to
sleep
,
and
not
before
,
I
return
to
my
guardian
to
say
good
night
,
and
then
I
come
back
to
Ada
and
sit
near
her
for
a
little
while
.
   
<EOS>
She
be
asleep
,
and
I
think
as
I
look
at
her
that
she
be
a
little
changed
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
think
so
more
than
once
lately
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
decide
,
even
look
at
her
while
she
be
unconscious
,
how
she
be
change
,
but
something
in
the
familiar
beauty
of
her
face
look
different
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
guardian
's
old
hope
of
her
and
Richard
arise
sorrowfully
in
my
mind
,
and
I
say
to
myself
,
"
She
have
be
anxious
about
him
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
wonder
how
that
love
would
end
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
have
come
home
from
Caddy
's
while
she
be
ill
,
I
have
often
find
Ada
at
work
,
and
she
have
always
put
her
work
away
,
and
I
have
never
know
what
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
it
now
lie
in
a
drawer
near
her
,
which
be
not
quite
closed
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
open
the
drawer
,
but
I
still
rather
wonder
what
the
work
could
he
,
for
it
be
evidently
nothing
for
herself
.
   
<EOS>
and
I
notice
as
I
kiss
my
dear
that
she
lie
with
one
hand
under
her
pillow
so
that
it
be
hide
.
   
<EOS>
how
much
less
amiable
I
must
have
be
than
they
think
me
,
how
much
less
amiable
than
I
think
myself
,
to
be
so
preoccupied
with
my
own
cheerfulness
and
contentment
as
to
think
that
it
only
rest
with
me
to
put
my
dear
girl
right
and
set
her
mind
at
peace
!
   
<EOS>
but
I
lie
down
,
self
-
deceive
,
in
that
belief
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
awoke
in
it
next
day
to
find
that
there
be
still
the
same
shade
between
me
and
my
darling

I
should
be
sorry

by
it

<EOS>
You
must
know

I

no
good
this
long
time

<EOS>
I
have
not

to
do
much
harm

I
seem
to
have
be
capable
of
nothing

It

be
that
I
should
have
do
better
by
keep
out
of
the

my

I
think
not

I
dare
say
you
will
soon
hear
,
if
you
have
not
already

,
a
very
different
opinion

<EOS>
to
make
short
of
a
long

I
be
afraid
I
have
want
an
object
;
but
I
have
an
object
now

or
it
have
me
---
and
it
be
too
late
to
discuss
it

<EOS>
take
me
as
I

make
the
good
of

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
a

Mr

as

"

You

"
return
Richard
,
"
you
can
pursue
your
art
for
its

can
put
your

upon

can
strike
a

out

anything

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
He
speak
regretfully

lapse
for
a
moment
into
his
weary
condition

"

well

shake

They
shake

in

heart

"
You

vhole

<EOS>
Woodcourt
,
there
be
one
subject
I
should
like
to
mention
,
for
once
and
for
all
,
in
the
beginning
of
our
treaty
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
hardly
make
the
good
of
me
if
I
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
,
I
dare
say
,
that
I
have
an
attachment
to
my
cousin
Ada
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Woodcourt
reply
that
I
have
hint
as
much
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
pray
,
"
return
Richard
,
"
do
not
think
me
a
heap
of
selfishness
.
<EOS>
do
not
suppose
that
I
be
split
my
head
and
half
break
my
heart
over
this
miserable
chancery
suit
for
my
own
right
and
interest
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Ada
's
be
bind
up
with
mine
;
they
can
not
be
separate
;
Vholes
work
for
both
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
do
think
of
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
be
so
very
solicitous
on
this
head
that
Mr
Woodcourt
give
him
the
strong
assurance
that
he
do
him
no
injustice
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
say
Richard
,
with
something
pathetic
in
his
manner
of
linger
on
the
point
,
though
it
be
off
-
hand
and
unstudied
,
"
to
an
upright
fellow
like
you
,
bring
a
friendly
face
like
yours
here
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
bear
the
thought
of
appear
selfish
and
mean
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
Ada
right
,
Woodcourt
,
as
well
as
myself
;
I
want
to
do
my
utmost
to
right
her
,
as
well
as
myself
;
I
venture
what
I
can
scrape
together
to
extricate
her
,
as
well
as
myself
.
 
<EOS>
do
,
I
beseech
you
,
think
of
that
!
"
   
<EOS>
afterwards
,
when
Mr
Woodcourt
come
to
reflect
on
what
have
pass
,
he
be
so
very
much
impress
by
the
strength
of
Richard
's
anxiety
on
this
point
that
in
tell
me
generally
of
his
first
visit
to
Symond
's
Inn
he
particularly
dwelt
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
revive
a
fear
I
have
have
before
that
my
dear
girl
's
little
property
would
be
absorb
by
Mr
Vholes
and
that
Richard
's
justification
to
himself
would
be
sincerely
this
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
just
as
I
begin
to
take
care
of
Caddy
that
the
interview
take
place
,
and
I
now
return
to
the
time
when
Caddy
have
recover
and
the
shade
be
still
between
me
and
my
darling
.
   
<EOS>
I
propose
to
Ada
that
morning
that
we
should
go
and
see
Richard
.
<EOS>
It
a
little
surprise
me
to
find
that
she
hesitate
and
be
not
so
radiantly
willing
as
I
have
expect
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
have
not
have
any
difference
with
Richard
since
I
have
be
so
much
away
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
,
Esther
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
not
hear
of
him
,
perhaps
?
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
have
hear
of
him
,
"
say
Ada
.
   
<EOS>
such
tear
in
her
eye
,
and
such
love
in
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
make
my
darling
out
.
 
<EOS>
Should
I
go
to
Richard
's
by
myself
?
<EOS>
I
say
.
<EOS>
no
,
Ada
think
I
have
well
not
go
by
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Would
she
go
with
me
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
Ada
think
she
have
better
go
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Should
we
go
now
?
<EOS>
yes
,
let
us
go
now
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
could
not
understand
my
darling
,
with
the
tear
in
her
eye
and
the
love
in
her
face
!
   
<EOS>
We
be
soon
equip
and
go
out
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
sombre
day
,
and
drop
of
chill
rain
fall
at
interval
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
those
colourless
day
when
everything
look
heavy
and
harsh
.
 
<EOS>
the
house
frown
at
us
,
the
dust
rise
at
us
,
the
smoke
swoop
at
us
,
nothing
make
any
compromise
about
itself
or
wear
a
soften
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
my
beautiful
girl
quite
out
of
place
in
the
rugged
street
,
and
I
think
there
be
more
funeral
pass
along
the
dismal
pavement
than
I
have
ever
see
before
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
first
to
find
out
Symond
's
Inn
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
go
to
inquire
in
a
shop
when
Ada
say
she
think
it
be
near
Chancery
Lane
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
be
not
likely
to
be
far
out
,
my
love
,
if
we
go
in
that
direction
,
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
so
to
Chancery
Lane
we
go
,
and
there
,
sure
enough
,
we
see
it
write
up
.
 
<EOS>
Symond
's
Inn
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
next
to
find
out
the
number
.
 
<EOS>
"
or
Mr
Vholes
's
office
will
do
,
"
I
recollect
,
"
for
<EOS>
Mr
Vholes
's
office
be
next
door
.
"
 
<EOS>
upon
which
Ada
say
,
perhaps
that
be
Mr
Vholes
's
office
in
the
corner
there
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
really
be
.
   
<EOS>
then
come
the
question
,
<EOS>
which
of
the
two
next
door
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
for
the
one
,
and
my
darling
be
go
for
the
other
;
and
my
darling
be
right
again
.
 
<EOS>
so
up
<EOS>
we
go
to
the
second
story
,
when
we
come
to
Richard
's
name
in
great
white
letter
on
a
hearse
-
like
panel
.
   
<EOS>
I
should
have
knock
,
but
Ada
say
perhaps
we
have
better
turn
the
handle
and
go
in
.
 
<EOS>
thus
we
come
to
Richard
,
pore
over
a
table
cover
with
dusty
bundle
of
paper
which
seem
to
me
like
dusty
mirror
reflect
his
own
mind
.
 
<EOS>
wherever
I
look
I
see
the
ominous
word
that
run
in
it
repeat
.
 
<EOS>
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
.
   
<EOS>
He
receive
us
very
affectionately
,
and
we
sit
down
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
have
come
a
little
earlier
,
"
he
say
,
"
you
would
have
find
Woodcourt
here
.
 
<EOS>
there
never
be
such
a
good
fellow
as
Woodcourt
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
find
time
to
look
in
between
-
while
,
when
anybody
else
with
half
his
work
to
do
would
be
think
about
not
be
able
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
be
so
cheery
,
so
fresh
,
so
sensible
<EOS>
,
so
earnest
,
<EOS>
so
---
everything
that
I
be
not
,
that
the
place
brighten
whenever
he
come
,
and
darken
whenever
he
go
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
God
bless
him
,
"
I
think
,
"
for
his
truth
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
be
not
so
sanguine
,
Ada
,
"
continue
Richard
,
cast
his
dejected
look
over
the
bundle
of
paper
,
"
as
Vholes
and
I
be
usually
,
but
he
be
only
an
outsider
and
be
not
in
the
mystery
.
<EOS>
We
have
go
into
them
,
and
he
have
not
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
not
be
expect
to
know
much
of
such
a
labyrinth
.
"
   
<EOS>
as
his
look
wander
over
the
paper
again
and
he
pass
his
two
hand
over
his
head
,
I
notice
how
sink
and
how
large
his
eye
appear
,
how
dry
his
lip
be
,
and
how
his
finger
-
nail
be
all
bite
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
this
a
healthy
place
to
live
in
,
Richard
,
do
you
think
?
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
my
dear
Minerva
,
"
answer
Richard
with
his
old
gay
laugh
,
"
it
be
neither
a
rural
nor
a
cheerful
place
;
and
when
the
sun
shine
here
,
you
may
lay
a
pretty
heavy
wager
that
it
be
shine
brightly
in
an
open
spot
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
well
enough
for
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
near
the
office
and
near
vhole
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
"
I
hint
,
"
a
change
from
both
---
"
   
"
may
do
me
good
?
"
say
Richard
,
force
a
laugh
as
he
finish
the
sentence
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
wonder
!
 
<EOS>
but
it
can
only
come
in
one
way
now
---
in
one
of
two
way
,
I
should
rather
say
.
 
<EOS>
either
the
suit
must
be
end
,
Esther
,
or
the
suitor
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
shall
be
the
suit
,
my
dear
girl
,
the
suit
,
my
dear
girl
!
"
   
<EOS>
these
latter
word
be
address
to
Ada
,
who
be
sit
near
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
be
turn
away
from
me
and
towards
him
,
I
could
not
see
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
be
do
very
well
,
"
pursue
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
vhole
will
tell
you
so
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
really
spin
along
.
 
<EOS>
ask
Vholes
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
give
them
no
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Vholes
know
all
their
winding
and
turning
,
and
we
be
upon
them
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
astonish
them
already
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
rouse
up
that
nest
of
sleeper
,
mark
my
word
!
"
   
<EOS>
His
hopefulness
have
long
be
more
painful
to
me
than
his
despondency
;
it
be
so
unlike
hopefulness
,
have
something
so
fierce
in
its
determination
to
be
it
,
be
so
hungry
and
eager
,
and
yet
so
conscious
of
be
force
and
unsustainable
that
it
have
long
touch
me
to
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
commentary
upon
it
now
indelibly
write
in
his
handsome
face
<EOS>
make
it
far
more
distressing
than
it
use
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
indelibly
,
for
I
feel
persuaded
that
if
the
fatal
cause
could
have
be
for
ever
terminate
,
accord
to
his
bright
vision
,
in
that
same
hour
,
the
trace
of
the
premature
anxiety
,
self
-
reproach
,
and
disappointment
it
have
occasion
him
would
have
remain
upon
his
feature
to
the
hour
of
his
death
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
sight
of
our
dear
little
woman
,
"
say
Richard
,
Ada
still
remain
silent
and
quiet
,
"
be
so
natural
to
me
,
and
her
compassionate
face
be
so
like
the
face
of
old
day
---
<EOS>
"
   
ah
!
 
<EOS>
no
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
I
smile
and
shake
my
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
---
so
exactly
like
the
face
of
old
day
,
"
say
Richard
in
his
cordial
voice
,
and
take
my
hand
with
the
brotherly
regard
which
nothing
ever
change
,
"
that
I
can
not
make
pretence
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
fluctuate
a
little
;
that
be
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
I
hope
,
my
dear
,
and
sometimes
I
---
do
not
quite
despair
,
but
nearly
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
,
"
say
Richard
,
relinquish
my
hand
gently
and
walk
across
the
room
,
"
so
tired
!

<EOS>
He
take
a
few
turn
up
and
down
and
sink
upon
the
sofa

I
get

he
repeat
gloomily
,

tired

be

weary

weary
work

<EOS>
He
be
lean
on
his
arm
say
these
word
in
a
meditative
voice

look
at
the
ground
when
my
darling
rise

put
off

bonnet

kneel
down
beside

golden
hair

I
shall
never
go
home
any
more
!
"
 
<EOS>
with
those
word
my
darling
draw
his
head
down
on
her
breast
and
hold
it
there
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
ever
in
my
life
I
see
a
love
that
nothing
but
death
could
change
<EOS>
,
I
see
it
then
before
me
.
   
<EOS>
"
speak
to
Esther
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Richard
,
break
the
silence
presently
.
 
<EOS>
"
tell
her
how
it
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
meet
her
before
she
could
come
to
me
and
fold
her
in
my
arm
.
<EOS>
We
neither
of
us
speak
,
but
with
her
cheek
against
my
own
I
want
to
hear
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
pet
,
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
My
love
.
 
<EOS>
My
poor
,
poor
girl
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
pity
her
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
fond
of
Richard
,
but
the
impulse
that
I
have
upon
me
be
to
pity
her
so
much
.
   
<EOS>
"
esther
,
will
you
forgive
me
?
 
<EOS>
Will
my
cousin
John
forgive
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
say
I
,
"
to
doubt
it
for
a
moment
be
to
do
him
a
great
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
to
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
why
,
as
to
me
,
what
have
I
to
forgive
!
   
<EOS>
I
dry
my
sobbing
darling
's
eye
and
sit
beside
her
on
the
sofa
,
and
Richard
sit
on
my
other
side
;
and
while
I
be
remind
of
that
so
different
night
when
they
have
first
take
me
into
their
confidence
and
have
go
on
in
their
own
wild
happy
way
,
they
tell
me
between
them
how
it
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
all
I
have
be
Richard
's
,
"
Ada
say
;
"
and
Richard
would
not
take
it
,
Esther
,
and
what
could
I
do
but
be
his
wife
when
I
love
him
dearly
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
you
be
so
fully
and
so
kindly
occupied
,
excellent
Dame
Durden
,
"
say
Richard
,
"
that
how
could
we
speak
to
you
at
such
a
time
!
 
<EOS>
and
besides
,
it
be
not
a
long
-
consider
step
.
 
<EOS>
We
go
out
one
morning
and
be
married
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
when
it
be
do
,
Esther
,
"
say
my
darling
,
"
I
be
always
think
how
to
tell
you
and
what
to
do
for
the
good
.
 
<EOS>
and
sometimes
I
think
you
ought
to
know
it
directly
,
and
<EOS>
sometimes
I
think
you
ought
not
to
know
it
and
keep
it
from
my
cousin
John
;
and
I
could
not
tell
what
to
do
,
and
I
fret
very
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
how
selfish
I
must
have
be
not
to
have
think
of
this
before
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
I
say
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
sorry
,
<EOS>
and
yet
I
be
so
fond
of
them
<EOS>
and
so
glad
that
they
be
fond
of
me
<EOS>
;
I
pity
them
so
much
,
and
yet
I
feel
a
kind
of
pride
in
their
love
one
another
.
<EOS>
I
never
have
experience
such
painful
and
pleasurable
emotion
at
one
time
,
and
in
my
own
heart
I
do
not
know
which
predominate
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
there
to
darken
their
way
;
I
do
not
do
that
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
be
less
foolish
and
more
composed
,
my
darling
take
her
wedding
-
ring
from
her
bosom
,
and
kiss
it
,
and
put
it
on
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
remember
last
night
and
tell
Richard
that
ever
since
her
marriage
she
have
wear
it
at
night
when
there
be
no
one
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
then
Ada
blushingly
ask
me
how
do
I
know
that
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
tell
Ada
how
I
have
see
her
hand
conceal
under
her
pillow
and
have
little
think
<EOS>
why
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
then
they
begin
tell
me
how
it
be
all
over
again
,
and
I
begin
to
be
sorry
and
glad
again
,
and
foolish
again
,
and
to
hide
my
plain
old
face
as
much
as
I
could
lest
I
should
put
them
out
of
heart
.
   
<EOS>
thus
the
time
go
on
until
it
become
necessary
for
me
to
think
of
return
.
 
<EOS>
when
that
time
arrive
it
be
the
bad
of
all
,
for
then
my
darling
completely
break
down
.
 
<EOS>
She
cling
<EOS>
round
my
neck
,
call
me
by
every
dear
name
she
could
think
of
and
say
what
should
she
do
without
me
!
 
<EOS>
nor
be
Richard
much
better
;
and
as
for
me
,
I
should
have
be
the
bad
of
the
three
if
I
have
not
severely
say
to
myself
,
"
now
Esther
,
if
you
do
,
I
will
never
speak
to
you
again
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
declare
,
"
say
I
,
<EOS>
"
I
never
see
such
a
wife
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
she
love
her
husband
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
Richard
,
take
my
child
,
for
goodness
'
sake
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
I
hold
her
tight
all
the
while
,
and
could
have
weep
over
her
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
long
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
give
this
dear
young
couple
notice
,
"
say
I
,
"
that
I
be
only
go
away
to
come
back
to
-
morrow
and
that
I
shall
be
always
come
backwards
and
forwards
until
Symond
's
Inn
be
tired
of
the
sight
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
shall
not
say
good
-
bye
,
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
for
what
would
be
the
use
of
that
,
you
know
,
when
I
be
come
back
so
soon
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
have
give
my
darling
to
him
now
,
and
I
mean
to
go
;
but
I
linger
for
one
more
look
of
the
precious
face
which
it
seem
to
rive
my
heart
to
turn
from
.
   
<EOS>
so
I
say
(
in
a
merry
,
bustling
manner
)
that
unless
they
give
me
some
encouragement
to
come
back
,
I
be
not
sure
that
I
could
take
that
liberty
,
upon
which
my
dear
girl
look
up
,
faintly
smile
through
her
tear
,
and
I
fold
her
lovely
face
between
my
hand
,
and
give
it
one
last
kiss
,
and
laugh
,
and
run
away
.
   
<EOS>
and
when
I
get
downstairs
,
oh
,
how
I
cry
!
 
<EOS>
It
almost
seem
to
me
that
I
have
lose
my
ada
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
lonely
and
so
blank
without
her
,
and
it
be
so
desolate
to
be
go
home
with
no
hope
of
see
her
there
,
that
I
could
get
no
comfort
for
a
little
while
as
I
walk
up
and
down
in
a
dim
corner
sob
and
crying
.
   
<EOS>
I
come
to
myself
by
and
by
,
after
a
little
scolding
,
and
take
a
coach
home
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
boy
whom
I
have
find
at
St
Albans
have
reappear
a
short
time
before
and
be
lie
at
the
point
of
death
;
indeed
,
be
then
dead
,
though
I
do
not
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
guardian
have
go
out
to
inquire
about
him
and
do
not
return
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
be
quite
alone
,
I
cry
a
little
again
,
though
on
the
whole
I
do
not
think
I
behave
so
very
,
very
ill
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
only
natural
that
I
should
not
be
quite
accustomed
to
the
loss
of
my
darling
yet
.
 
<EOS>
three
or
four
hour
be
not
a
long
time
after
year
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
mind
dwell
so
much
upon
the
uncongenial
scene
in
which
I
have
leave
her
,
and
I
picture
it
as
such
an
overshadowed
stony
-
hearte
one
,
and
I
so
long
to
be
near
her
and
take
some
sort
of
care
of
her
,
that
I
determine
to
go
back
in
the
evening
only
to
look
up
at
her
window
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
foolish
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
but
it
do
not
then
seem
at
all
so
to
me
,
and
it
do
not
seem
quite
so
even
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
Charley
into
my
confidence
,
and
we
go
out
at
dusk
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
dark
when
we
come
to
the
new
strange
home
of
my
dear
girl
,
and
there
be
a
light
behind
the
yellow
blind
.
 
<EOS>
We
walk
past
cautiously
three
or
four
time
,
look
up
,
and
narrowly
miss
encounter
Mr
Vholes
,
who
come
out
of
his
office
while
we
be
there
and
turn
his
head
to
look
up
too
before
go
home
.
 
<EOS>
the
sight
of
his
lank
black
figure
and
the
lonesome
air
of
that
nook
in
the
dark
be
favourable
to
the
state
of
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
of
the
youth
and
love
and
beauty
of
my
dear
girl
,
shut
up
in
such
an
ill
-
assorted
refuge
,
almost
as
if
it
be
a
cruel
place
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
very
solitary
and
very
dull
,
and
I
do
not
doubt
that
I
may
safely
steal
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
I
leave
Charley
below
and
go
up
with
a
light
foot
,
not
distress
by
any
glare
from
the
feeble
oil
lantern
on
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
listen
for
a
few
moment
,
and
in
the
musty
rot
silence
of
the
house
believe
that
I
could
hear
the
murmur
of
their
young
voice
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
my
lip
to
the
hearse
-
like
panel
of
the
door
as
a
kiss
for
my
dear
and
come
quietly
down
again
,
think
that
one
of
these
day
I
would
confess
to
the
visit
.
   
<EOS>
and
it
really
do
me
good
,
for
though
nobody
but
Charley
<EOS>
and
I
know
anything
about
it
<EOS>
,
I
somehow
feel
as
if
it
have
diminish
the
separation
between
Ada
and
me
and
have
bring
us
together
again
for
those
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
back
,
not
quite
accustomed
yet
to
the
change
,
but
all
the
well
for
that
hover
about
my
darling
.
   
<EOS>
My
guardian
have
come
home
and
be
stand
thoughtfully
by
the
dark
window
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
go
in
,
his
face
clear
and
he
come
to
his
seat
,
but
he
catch
the
light
upon
my
face
as
I
take
mine
.
   
<EOS>
"
little
woman
,
"
say
he
,
"
You
have
be
cry
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
yes
,
guardian
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
be
afraid
I
have
be
,
a
little
.
<EOS>
Ada
have
be
in
such
distress
,
and
be
so
very
sorry
,
guardian
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
put
my
arm
on
the
back
of
his
chair
,
and
I
see
in
his
glance
that
my
word
and
my
look
at
her
empty
place
have
prepare
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
she
married
,
my
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
tell
him
all
about
it
and
how
her
first
entreaty
have
refer
to
his
forgiveness
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
have
no
need
of
it
,
"
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
Heaven
bless
her
and
her
husband
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
just
as
my
first
impulse
have
be
to
pity
her
,
so
be
his
.
 
<EOS>
"
poor
girl
,
poor
girl
!
 
<EOS>
Poor
Rick
!
 
<EOS>
Poor
Ada
!
"
   
<EOS>
neither
of
us
speak
after
that
,
until
he
say
with
a
sigh
,
"
<EOS>
well
,
well
,
my
dear
!
 
<EOS>
Bleak
House
be
thin
fast
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
but
its
mistress
remain
,
guardian
.
"
 
<EOS>
though
I
be
timid
about
say
it
,
I
venture
because
of
the
sorrowful
tone
in
which
he
have
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
will
do
all
she
can
to
make
it
happy
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
She
will
succeed
,
my
love
!
"
   
<EOS>
the
letter
have
make
no
difference
between
us
except
that
the
seat
by
his
side
have
come
to
be
mine
;
it
make
none
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
turn
his
old
bright
<EOS>
fatherly
look
upon
me
,
lay
his
hand
on
my
hand
in
his
old
way
,
and
say
again
,
"
She
will
succeed
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
Bleak
House
be
thin
fast
,
o
little
woman
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
presently
that
this
be
all
we
say
about
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
rather
disappointed
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
I
may
not
quite
have
be
all
I
have
mean
to
be
since
the
letter
and
the
answer
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
52
.
<EOS>
obstinacy
 
<EOS>
but
one
other
day
have
intervene
when
,
early
in
the
morning
as
we
be
go
to
breakfast
,
Mr
Woodcourt
come
in
haste
with
the
astounding
news
that
a
terrible
murder
have
be
commit
for
which
Mr
George
have
be
apprehend
and
be
in
custody
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
tell
us
that
a
large
reward
be
offer
by
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
for
the
murderer
's
apprehension
,
I
do
not
in
my
first
consternation
understand
why
;
but
a
few
more
word
explain
to
me
that
the
murder
person
be
Sir
Leicester
's
lawyer
,
and
immediately
my
mother
's
dread
of
him
rush
into
my
remembrance
.
   
<EOS>
this
unforeseen
and
violent
removal
of
one
whom
she
have
long
watch
and
distrust
and
who
have
long
watch
and
distrust
her
,
one
for
whom
she
could
have
have
few
interval
of
kindness
,
always
dread
in
him
a
dangerous
and
secret
enemy
,
appear
so
awful
that
my
first
thought
be
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
how
appalling
to
hear
of
such
a
death
and
be
able
to
feel
no
pity
!
 
<EOS>
how
dreadful
to
remember
,
perhaps
,
that
she
have
sometimes
even
wish
the
old
man
away
who
be
so
swiftly
hurry
out
of
life
!
   
<EOS>
such
crowd
reflection
,
increase
the
distress
and
fear
I
always
feel
when
the
name
be
mention
,
make
me
so
agitated
that
I
could
scarcely
hold
my
place
at
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
quite
unable
to
follow
the
conversation
until
I
have
have
a
little
time
to
recover
.
<EOS>
but
when
I
come
to
myself
and
see
how
shocked
my
guardian
be
and
find
that
they
be
earnestly
speak
of
the
suspect
man
and
recall
every
favourable
impression
we
have
form
of
him
out
of
the
good
we
have
know
of
him
,
my
interest
and
my
fear
be
so
strongly
aroused
in
his
behalf
that
I
be
quite
set
up
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Guardian
,
you
do
not
think
it
possible
that
he
be
justly
accuse
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
I
CAN'T
think
so
.
 
<EOS>
this
man
whom
we
have
see
so
open
-
hearted
and
compassionate
,
who
with
the
might
of
a
giant
have
the
gentleness
of
a
child
,
who
look
as
brave
a
fellow
as
ever
live
and
be
so
simple
and
quiet
with
it
,
this
man
justly
accuse
of
such
a
crime
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
believe
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
I
do
not
<EOS>
or
I
will
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
can
not
,
"
say
Mr
Woodcourt
.
 
<EOS>
"
still
,
whatever
we
believe
or
know
of
him
,
we
have
well
not
forget
that
some
appearance
be
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
bear
an
animosity
towards
the
deceased
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
have
openly
mention
it
in
many
place
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
say
to
have
express
himself
violently
towards
him
,
and
he
certainly
do
about
him
,
to
my
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
He
admit
that
he
be
alone
on
the
scene
of
the
murder
within
a
few
minute
of
its
commission
.
 
<EOS>
I
sincerely
believe
him
to
be
as
innocent
of
any
participation
in
it
as
I
be
,
but
these
be
all
reason
for
suspicion
fall
upon
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
true
,
"
say
my
guardian
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
add
,
turn
to
me
,
"
It
would
be
do
him
a
very
bad
service
,
my
dear
,
to
shut
our
eye
to
the
truth
in
any
of
these
respect
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
feel
,
of
course
,
that
we
must
admit
,
not
only
to
ourselves
but
to
other
,
the
full
force
of
the
circumstance
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
yet
I
know
withal
(
I
could
not
help
say
)
that
their
weight
would
not
induce
us
to
desert
him
in
his
need
.
   
<EOS>
"
Heaven
forbid
!
"
return
my
guardian
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
will
stand
by
him
,
as
he
himself
stand
by
the
two
poor
creature
who
be
go
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
mean
Mr
Gridley
and
the
boy
,
to
both
of
whom
Mr
George
have
give
shelter
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Woodcourt
then
tell
us
that
the
trooper
's
man
have
be
with
him
before
day
,
after
wander
about
the
street
all
night
like
a
distracted
creature
.
 
<EOS>
that
one
of
the
trooper
's
first
anxiety
be
that
we
should
not
suppose
him
guilty
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
have
charge
his
messenger
to
represent
his
perfect
innocence
with
every
solemn
assurance
be
could
send
us
.
 
<EOS>
that
Mr
Woodcourt
have
only
quiet
the
man
by
undertake
to
come
to
our
house
very
early
in
the
morning
with
these
representation
.
 
<EOS>
He
add
that
he
be
now
upon
his
way
to
see
the
prisoner
himself
.
   
<EOS>
My
guardian
say
directly
he
would
go
too
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
besides
that
I
like
the
retired
soldier
very
much
and
that
he
like
me
<EOS>
,
I
have
that
secret
interest
in
what
have
happen
which
be
only
know
to
my
guardian
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
it
come
close
and
near
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
become
personally
important
to
myself
that
the
truth
should
be
discover
and
that
no
innocent
people
should
be
suspect
,
for
suspicion
,
once
run
wild
,
may
run
wilder
.
   
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
I
feel
as
if
it
be
my
duty
and
obligation
to
go
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
My
guardian
do
not
seek
to
dissuade
me
,
and
I
go
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
large
prison
with
many
court
and
passage
so
like
one
another
<EOS>
and
so
uniformly
pave
that
I
seem
to
gain
a
new
comprehension
,
as
I
pass
along
,
of
the
fondness
that
solitary
prisoner
,
shut
up
among
the
same
stare
wall
from
year
to
year
,
have
have
---
as
I
have
read
---
for
a
weed
or
a
stray
blade
of
grass
.
 
<EOS>
in
an
arched
room
by
himself
,
like
a
cellar
upstairs
,
with
wall
so
glaringly
white
that
they
make
the
massive
iron
window
-
bar
and
iron
-
bind
door
even
more
profoundly
black
than
they
be
,
we
find
the
trooper
stand
in
a
corner
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
sit
on
a
bench
there
and
have
rise
when
he
hear
the
lock
and
bolt
turn
.
   
<EOS>
when
he
see
us
,
he
come
forward
a
step
with
his
usual
heavy
tread
,
and
there
stop
and
make
a
slight
bow
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
I
still
advance
,
put
out
my
hand
to
him
,
he
understand
us
in
a
moment

<EOS>
"
this
be
a
load
off
my
mind
,
I
do
assure
you
,
miss

say
he
,
salute
us
with
great
heartiness
and
draw
a
long
breath
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
now
I
do
not
so
much
care
how
it
end
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
scarcely
seem
to
be
the
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
what
with
his
coolness
and
his
soldierly
bear
,
he
look
far
more
like
the
prison
guard
.
   
<EOS>
"
this
be
even
a
rough
place
than
my
gallery
to
receive
a
lady
in
,
"
say
Mr
George
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
know
Miss
Summerson
will
make
the
good
of
it
.

<EOS>
as
he
hand
me
to
the
bench
on
which
he
have
be
sit
,
I
sit
down
,
which
seem
to
give
him
great
satisfaction
.

I
thank
you

<EOS>
"
now
,
George

"
observe
my
guardian

"
as
we
require
no
new
assurance
on
your

<EOS>
I
believe
we
need
give
you
none
on
ours

<EOS>
"
not
at
all

<EOS>
I

all
my

I
be
not
innocent

I
could
not
look
at
you
and
keep
my
secret
to
myself
under
the
condescension
of
the
present
visit

<EOS>
I
feel
the
present
visit
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
one
of
the
eloquent
sort
,

I
feel
it
,
Miss
Summerson
and
gentleman
,
deeply
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
lay
his
hand
for
a
moment
on
his
broad
chest
and
bend
his
bead
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
although
he
square
himself
again
directly
,
he
express
a
great
amount
of
natural
emotion
by
these
simple
mean

<EOS>
"
first
,
"

my
guardian

can
we
do
anything
for

George
,
after
a
little
cogitation
,

I

for

I
will
mention
presently

<EOS>
"
I
should
have
get
a
lawyer
,
and
he
would
have
say
(
as
I
have
often
read
in
the
newspaper
)
,
"
My

say
nothing

my

reserve
his
defence

:
<EOS>
my
client
this
,
that

t'other
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
'
tis
not
the
custom
of
that
breed
to
go
straight
,
accord
to
my
opinion
,
or
to
think
that
other
man
do
.
 
<EOS>
say
I
be
innocent
<EOS>
and
I
get
a
lawyer
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
be
as
likely
to
believe
me
guilty
as
not
;
perhaps
more
.
 
<EOS>
what
would
he
do
,
whether
or
not
?
 
<EOS>
act
as
if
I
be
---
 
shut
my
mouth
up
,
tell
me
not
to
commit
myself
,
keep
circumstance
back
,
chop
the
evidence
small
,
quibble
,
and
get
me
off
perhaps
!
<EOS>
but
,
Miss
Summerson
,
do
I
care
for
get
off
in
that
way
;
or
would
I
rather
be
hang
in
my
own
way

if
you
will
excuse
my
mention
anything
so
disagreeable
to
a
lady
?

<EOS>
He
have
warm
into
his
subject
now
,
and
be
under
no
further
necessity
to
wait
a
bit

<EOS>

I
would
rather
be
hang
in
my
own

I
mean
to
be

<EOS>
I
do
not
intend
to
say
,
"
look
round
upon
us
with
his
powerful
arm
akimbo

his
dark
eyebrow
raise
,
"
that
I
be
more
partial
to
be
hang
than
another
man

<EOS>
what
I
say
be
,
I
must
come
off
clear
and
full
or
not
at
all

<EOS>
therefore
,
when
I
hear
state
against
me
what
be
true
,
I
say
it
be
true
;
and
when
they
tell
me
,
"
whatever
you
say
will
be
use
,
"
I
tell
them
I
do
not
mind
that
;
I
mean
it
to
be
use
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
can
not
make
me
innocent
out
of
the
whole
truth

they
be
not
likely
to
do
it
out
of
anything
less
,
or
anything
else

<EOS>
and
if
they
be
,
it
be
worth
nothing

me

a
pace
or
two
over
the
stone
floor

he
come
back

this
by

more
persuadable
we

and
let
me
entreat
you
to
consider
that
the
clearing
up
of
this
mystery

deed
may
be
of
the

hear
me
respectfully

I
speak
a
little
turn
from

already
on

he
be
observe
(
this
they
afterwards
tell
me

<EOS>
my
height

figure

catch
his

all
at

curious

my
ill
fortune
take
me
to

a

half
a

come
downstairs

up

the

window

loose

mantle
on

notice
a
deep
fringe

it
have
nothing
to
do

I
can
not
separate

define
the
feeling
that
arise
in

after
this

it
be
enough
that
the
vague
duty
and
obligation
I
have
feel
upon
me
from
the
first
of
follow
the
investigation
be
,
without
my
distinctly
daring

ask
myself
any
question

increase
,

I

indignantly
sure

there
be
no
possibility

be
afraid

We
three
go
out

up

down

then
with

with
much
deliberation

pronounce

<EOS>
now
although
Mr

within
the

one
with

receive
some
score
of

it
happen
that
much
correspondence
be
not
incidental
to
his
life

<EOS>
He
be
no
great
scribe

rather
handle
his
pen
like
the
pocket

staff
he
carry
about
with
him
always
convenient
to
his
grasp
,
and
discourage
correspondence
with
himself
in
other
as
be
too
artless

direct
a
way
of
do
delicate
business
.
 
<EOS>
further
,
he
often
see
damaging
letter
produce
in
evidence
and
have
occasion
to
reflect
that
it
be
a
green
thing
to
write
them
.
 
<EOS>
for
these
reason
he
have
very
little
to
do
with

,
either
as
sender
or
receiver
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
he
have
receive
a
round
half

four

He

ungirdle
his
black
pocket

<EOS>
have
put
the

three
distinctly
different
bow
to
these
three
people

<EOS>
a
bow
of
homage
to
Sir
Leicester
,
a
bow
of
gallantry
to
Volumnia
,
and
a
bow
of
recognition
to
the
debilitate
Cousin
,
to
whom
it
airily
say
,
"
<EOS>
You
be
a
swell
about
town
,
and
you
know
me
,
and
I
know
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
have
distribute
these
little
specimen
of
his
tact
,
Mr

rub
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
have
you
anything
new
to
communicate
,
officer
?
"
inquire
Sir
Leicester
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
wish
to
hold
any
conversation
with
me
in
private
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
why
---
not
tonight
,
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock

a
view
to
the
vindication
of

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bucket
cough
and
glance
at
Volumnia
,
rouge
and
necklace
,
as
though
he
would
respectfully
observe
<EOS>
,
"
I
do
assure
you
,
you
be
a
pretty
creetur
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
hundred
worse

at
your
time
of
life

I
have
indeed
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
fair
Volumnia
,
not
quite
unconscious
perhaps
of
the
humanizing
influence
of
her
charm
,
pause
in
the
writing
of
cock
-
hat
note
and
meditatively
adjust
the
pearl
necklace
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bucket
price
that
decoration
in
his
mind
and
think
it
as
likely
as
not
that
Volumnia
be
write
poetry
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
I
have
not
,
"
pursue
Sir
Leicester
,
"
in
the
most
emphatic
manner
,
adjure
you
,
officer
,
to
exercise
your
utmost
skill
in
this
atrocious
case
,
<EOS>
I
particularly
desire
to
take
the
present
opportunity
of
rectify
any
omission
I
may
have
make
.
 
<EOS>

no
expense
be
a
consideration

You

incur
none
in

the
object

have
undertake
that
I
shall
hesitate
for
a
moment
to
bear
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bucket
make
Sir
Leicester
's
bow
again
as
a
response
to
this
liberality

<EOS>
My
mind

Sir

with
a
generous
warmth
,
"
have
not

as
may
be
easily
suppose
,
recover
its
tone
since
the
late
diabolical
occurrence
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
likely
ever
to
recover
its
tone
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
full
of
indignation
to
-
night
after
undergo
the
ordeal
of

feel

<EOS>
a
gentleman

in
the
very
beginning

I
can
not
quite
take
upon
myself
to
say

I
know
from
his
lip
that
he
long
ago
suspect
Lady

of
have
discover
,
through
the
sight
of
some
handwriting
---
in
this
very
house
,
and
when
you
yourself
,
Sir

Dedlock
,
be
present
---
the
existence
,
in
great
poverty
,
of
a
certain
person
who
have
be
her
lover
before
you
court
her
and
who
ought
to
have
be
her
husband

"
 
<EOS>
Mr

stop
and
deliberately
repeat
,
"
Ought
to
have
be
her
husband

not
a
doubt
about
it

<EOS>
I
know
from
his
lip
that
when
that
person
soon
afterwards
die
,
he
suspect
Lady
Dedlock
of
visit
his
wretched
lodging
and
his
wretched
grave
,
alone
and
in
secret
.
<EOS>
I
know
from
my
own
inquiry
and
through
my
eye
and
ear
that
Lady
Dedlock
do
make
such
visit
in
the
dress
of
her
own
maid
,
for
the
deceased
Mr

employ
me
to
reckon
up
her
ladyship

if
you
will
excuse
my
make
use
of
the
term
we
commonly
employ

and
I
reckon
her
up
,
so
far
,
completely
.
 
<EOS>
I
confront
the
maid
in
the
chamber
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
with
a
witness
who
have
be
Lady
Dedlock
's
guide
,
and
there
could
not
be
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
she
have
wear
the
young
woman
's
dress
,
unknown
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
,
Baronet
<EOS>
,
I
do
endeavour
to
pave
the
way
a
little
towards
these
unpleasant
disclosure
yesterday
by

that
very
strange
thing
happen
even
in
high
family
sometimes
.
<EOS>
all
this
,
and
more
,
have
happen
in
your
own
family
,
and
to
and
through
your
own
Lady
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
my
belief
that
the
deceased
Mr
Tulkinghorn
follow
up
these
inquiry
to
the
hour
of
his
death
and
that
he
and
Lady
Dedlock
even
have
bad
blood
between
them
upon
the
matter
that
very
night
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
only
you
put
that
to
Lady
Dedlock
,
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
,
Baronet
,
and
ask
her
ladyship
whether
,
even
after
he
have
leave
here
,
she
do
not
go
down
to
his
chamber
with
the
intention
of
say
something
further
to
him
,
dress
in
a
loose
black
mantle
with
a
deep
fringe
to
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sir
Leicester
sit
like
a
statue
,
gaze
at
the
cruel
finger
that
be
probe
the
life
-
blood
of
his
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
put
that
to
her
ladyship

Sir
Leicester
Dedlock

Baronet
,
from
me
,
Inspector
Bucket
of
the
Detective
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
her
ladyship
make
any
difficulty
about
admit
of
it
,
you
tell
her
that
it
be
no
use
,
that
Inspector
Bucket
know
it
and
know
that
she
pass
the
soldier
as
you
call
him
(
though
he
be
not
in
the
army
now
)
and
know
that
she
know
she
pass
him
on
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
,
Baronet
,
why
do
I
relate
all
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
Sir
Leicester
,
who
have
cover
his
face
with
his
hand
,
utter
a
single
groan
,
request
him
to
pause
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
by
and
by
he
take
his
hand
away
,
and
so
preserve
his
dignity
and
outward
calmness
,
though
there
be
no
more
colour
in
his
face
than
in
his
white
hair
,
that
Mr
Bucket
be
a
little
awed
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
something
freeze
and
fix
be
upon
his
manner
,
over
and
above
its
usual
shell
of
haughtiness
,
and
Mr
Bucket
soon
detect
an
unusual
slowness
in
his
speech
,
with
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
curious
trouble
in
beginning
,
which
occasion
him
to
utter
inarticulate
sound
.
 
<EOS>
with
such
sound
he
now
break
silence
,
soon
,
however
,
control
himself
to
say
that
he
do
not
comprehend
why
a
gentleman
so
faithful
and
zealous
as
the
late
Mr
Tulkinghorn
should
have
communicate
to
him
nothing
of
this
painful
,
this
distressing
,
this
unlooke
-
for
,
this
overwhelming
,
this
incredible
intelligence
.
   
<EOS>
"

it
right
,
from
Inspector
Bucket

<EOS>
You
will
find
,
or
I
be
much
mistaken
,
that
the
deceased
Mr

have
the
intention
of
communicate
the
whole
to
you
as
soon
as
he
consider
it
ripe
,
and
further
,
that
he
have
give
her
ladyship
so
to
understand

it

mysterious
part

his
coat

identifle
it

what
have
you
get
to

ask
Mr

you
ask
me
to
consider
a
proposal

why

it
be
an
unreasonable
proposal

<EOS>
two
fifty

enough

Mr

"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bucket
ask
,
triumphant
in
his
admiration
of
his
lady
's
genius
.
   
<EOS>
two
thing
be
especially
observable
as
Mr
Bucket
proceed
to
a
conclusion
.
 
<EOS>
first
,
that
he
seem
imperceptibly
to
establish
a
dreadful
right
of
property
in
mademoiselle
.
 
<EOS>
secondly
,
that
the
very
atmosphere
she
breathe
seem
to
narrow
and
contract
about
her
as
if
a
close
net
or
a
pall
be
be
draw
nearer
and
yet
near
around
her
breathless
figure
.
   
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
doubt
that
her
ladyship
be
on
the
spot
at
the
eventful
period
,
"
say
Mr
Bucket
,
"
and
my
foreign
friend
here
see
her
,
I
believe
,
from
the
upper
part
of
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
and
George
and
my
foreign
friend
be
all
pretty
close
on
one
another
's
heel
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
do
not
signify
any
more
,
so
<EOS>
I
will
not
go
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
the
wadding
of
the
pistol
with
which
the
deceased
Mr
Tulkinghorn
be
shoot
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
bit
of
the
print
description
of
your
house
at
Chesney
Wold
.
 
<EOS>
not
much
in
that
,
you
will
say
,
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
,
Baronet
.
 
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
my
foreign
friend
here
be
so
thoroughly
off
her
guard
as
to
think
it
a
safe
time
to
tear
up
the
rest
of
that
leaf
,
and
when
Mrs
Bucket
put
the
piece
together
and
find
the
wadding
want
,
it
begin
to
look
like
Queer
Street
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
these
be
very
long
lie
,
"
mademoiselle
interpose

<EOS>
"
You
prose
great
deal

be
it
that
you
have
almost
all
finish

you
speak
always

<EOS>
"
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock

Baronet

proceed
Mr
Bucket
,
who
delight
in
a
full
title
and
do
violence
to
himself
when
he
dispense
with
any
fragment
of
it
,
"
the
last
point
in
the
case
which
I
be
now
go
to
mention
show
the
necessity
of
patience
in
our
business
,
and
never
do
a
thing
in
a
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
I
watch
this
young
woman
yesterday
without
her
knowledge
when
she
be
look
at
the
funeral
,
in
company
with
my
wife
,
who
plan
to
take
her
there
;
and
I
have
so
much
to
convict
her
,
and
I
see
such
an
expression
in
her
face
,
and
my
mind
so
rise
against
her
malice
towards
her
ladyship
,
and
the
time
be
altogether
such
a
time
for
bring
down
what
you
may
call
retribution
upon
her
,
that
if
I
have
be
a
young
hand
with
less
experience

I
should
have
take
her

certain
.
 
<EOS>
equally
,
last
night
,
when
her
ladyship
,
as
be
so
universally
admired
I
be
sure

come
home
looking
---
why
,
Lord
,
a
man
may
almost
say
like
Venus
rise
from
the
ocean

---
it
be
so
unpleasant
and
inconsistent
to
think
of
her
be
charge
with
a
murder
of
which
she
be
innocent
that
I
feel
quite
to
want
to
put
an
end
to
the
job

I

he
accomplish

manner

peculiar

enfold

pervade
her
like

cloud

hover
away

push
back

a

step

support

by

with

lift
up
his

at
something

if
such
shadow

there
be
one

shadow

name
with
something

distinctness

to
which
alone

his
tearing

pronounce
her

with
something

distinctness

intrusive

in
a
tone
of
mourning

compassion
rather

Mrs

I

<EOS>
"
why

Mrs

it
be
because
I

this

that
you

"
 
<EOS>
"
what
have
you

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
"
why

shake
his

"
what
I
have
do
have
be
do
this
many

be

not

<EOS>
if
I

"
 
<EOS>
now
,
madam
,
when
George
say
to
me
that
it
be
good
not
try
to
be
undo
now
,
I
have
my
thought
as
I
have
often
have
before
,
and
I
draw
it
out
of
George
how
he
come
to
have
such
thing
on
him
that
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
then
George
tell
me
that
he
have
see
by
chance
,
at
the
lawyer
's
office
,
a
fine
old
lady
that
have
bring
his
mother
plain
before
him
,
and
he
run
on
about
that
old
lady
till
he
quite
forget
himself
and
paint
her
picture
to
me
as
she
use
to
be
,
year
upon
year
back
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
say
to
George
when
he
have
do
,
who
be
this
old
lady
he
have
see
?
 
<EOS>
and
George
tell
me
it
be
Mrs
Rouncewell
,
housekeeper
for
more
than
half
a
century
to
the
Dedlock
family
down
at
Chesney
Wold
in
Lincolnshire

<EOS>
George
have
frequently
tell
me
before
that
he
be
a
Lincolnshire
man

and
I
say
to
my
old

that
night
,
"

that
be
his

<EOS>
all
this
Mrs

now
relate
for
the
twentieth
time
at
least
within
the
last
four
hour

<EOS>
trill
it
out
like
a
kind
of
bird
,
with
a
pretty
high
note
,
that
it
may
be
audible
to
the
old
lady
above
the
hum
of
the
wheel
.
   
<EOS>
"
bless
you

thank
you

say
Mrs

what

put
himself
in
the
right
and
clear
himself
of
a
charge
of
which
he
be
as
innocent
as
you
or
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
not
do
to
have
truth
and
justice
on
his
side
;
he
must
have
law
and
lawyer
,
"
exclaim
the
old

,
apparently
persuade
that
the
latter
form
a
separate
establishment
and
have
dissolve
partnership
with
truth
and
justice
for
ever

a
day

<EOS>
"
He

Mrs

"
all
the
help

can

I
will
spend
all
I

Sir

I

I

will
make
my

all
these

find
him
in
a
jail

"
   
<EOS>
the
extreme
disquietude
of
the
old
housekeeper
's
manner
in
say
this
,
her
broken
word
,
and
her
wringing
of
her
hand
make
a
powerful
impression
on
Mrs
Bagnet
and
would
astonish
her
but
that
she
refer
them
all
to
her
sorrow
for
her
son
's
condition
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
Mrs
Bagnet
wonder
too
why
Mrs
Rouncewell
should
murmur
so
distractedly
,
"
My
Lady
,
my
Lady
,
my
Lady

<EOS>
over

over

It

<EOS>
London
reach
,
the
traveller
alight
,
the
old
housekeeper
in
great
tribulation
and
confusion
,
Mrs
Bagnet
quite
fresh
and
collect
---
as
she
would
be
if
her
next

with
no

Good
Hope

the

the

draw
about

much

ruffle
it
these
many

<EOS>
approach
the
cell

they
find
the
door
opening
and
a
warder
in
the
act
of
come
out

<EOS>
the
old
girl
promptly
make
a
sign
of
entreaty
to
him
to
say
nothing
;
assent
with
a
nod
,
he
suffer
them
to
enter
as
he
shut
the
door

<EOS>
so
George

suppose
himself
to
be
alone

do
not
raise
his

remain
absorb

<EOS>
the
old
housekeeper
look
at
him
,
and
those
wander
hand
of
her
be
quite
enough
for
Mrs

's
confirmation
,
even
if
she
could
see
the
mother

the
son
together
,
know
what
she
know

doubt
their

<EOS>
not
a
rustle
of
the
housekeeper

not

not

<EOS>
She
stand
look
at

he
write
on

all
unconscious

only
her
flutter
hand
give
utterance
to
her
emotion

<EOS>
but
they
be
very
eloquent

very

very
eloquent

<EOS>
Mrs

understand
them

<EOS>
They
speak
of
gratitude

of
joy

grief

of
inextinguishable

of

so
fondly

they

in
such

clasp
his

<EOS>
round
the

fall
down
on
his

<EOS>
whether
in
a
late
repentance

whether
in
the
first
association
that
come

he
put
his

together
as

all

turn
away

lean
one
arm
against

whitened
wall

lean
her
honest
forehead
upon
it
,
wipe
her
eye
with
her
serviceable
grey
cloak

quite
enjoy
herself
like

She
always

do

<EOS>
She
tell
him
how
she
have
have
it
write
in
her

,
<EOS>
these
many
year

that
he

She
have
never
believe
any
ill

never

if

have
die
without
this
happiness

and
she
be
an
old
woman
now

can
not

very
long

she
would
have
bless
him
with

"
mother

I
have
be
an
undutiful

I
have
my
reward

but
of
late
year
I
have
have
a
kind
of
glimmering

a
purpose
in
me
too

<EOS>
when
I
leave
home
I
do
not
care
much
,
mother

I
be
afraid
not

go
away

<EOS>
the
trooper
have
dry
his
eye
and
put
away
his
handkerchief
,
but
there
be
an
extraordinary
contrast
between
his
habitual
manner
of
express
himself

carry
himself

the
softened
tone
in
which
he
speak

interrupt
occasionally

I

abroad

at
one

I

from

through
a
service

old

overturn
the
trooper
afresh

he
set
himself
up
with
a
great
,
rough
,
sound
clearance
of
his
throat

<EOS>

Heaven
forgive
me

there
would
be
small
consolation

anything

bad
be
past
with
you

know
by

time

how
you
have
mourn
for

weep
for
me

pray
for
me

pain
be
over

soften
down

I

<EOS>
the
old
lady
sorrowfully
shake
her
head

take
one
of
his
powerful
hand

lay
it
lovingly
upon
her
shoulder

no

just
now

what

come

well

my

some
good
may
have
come
of
it
to
myself

there
be
the
meanness
of
it

You
would
have
seek
me
out
;
you
would
have
purchase
my
discharge
;
you
would
have
take
me
down
to
Chesney
Wold
;
you
would
have
bring
me
and
my
brother

my
brother

family
together

you
would
all
have
consider
anxiously
how
to
do
something
for
me

set
me
up
as
a
respectable
civilian

how

any

you
feel
sure
of
me

I
could
not
so
much

feel
sure
of
myself

<EOS>
how
could
you
help
regard
as
an
incumbrance

a
discredit

you

idle
dragooning
chap

be
an
incumbrance

<EOS>
how
could
I
look
my
brother

child
in
the
face

pretend
to
set
them
an
example

I

the
vagabond
boy

the
grief

the

a
great
poke

this
action

afterwards
repeat

at
interval

in

species
of
affectionate
lunacy

never
fail

after
the
administration

He

He
lie
upon

an
aged

the

His
voice
be
rich

mellow
and
he
have
so
long
be
thoroughly
persuade
of
the
weight
and
import
to
mankind
of

that
his

but
now
he
can
only
whisper

and
what
he
whisper
sound
like
what

mere
jumble
and
jargon

<EOS>
His
favourite
and
faithful
housekeeper
stand
at
his
bedside

<EOS>
It
be
the
first
act

and
he
clearly
derive
pleasure
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
after
vainly
try
to
make
himself
understand
in
speech
,
he
make
sign
for
a
pencil
.
 
<EOS>
so
inexpressively
that
they
can
not
at
first
understand
him
;
it
be
his
old
housekeeper
who
make
out
what
he
want
and
bring
in
a
slate
.
   
<EOS>
after
pause
for
some

he
slowly
scrawl
upon

<EOS>
this
,
with
the
tear
course
down
her
fair
old
face
.
   
<EOS>
after
make
a
survey
of
the
room
and
look
with
particular
attention
all
round
the
bed
where
the
doctor
stand
,
he
write
,
"
<EOS>

"
   
<EOS>
"
My

<EOS>
He
point
again
,
in
great
agitation
,
at
the
two
word

<EOS>
They
all
try
to
quiet
him
,
but
he
point
again
with
increase
agitation
.
 
<EOS>
on
their
look
at
one
another
,
not
know
what
to
say
,
he
take
the
slate
once
more
and
write
"
My
Lady
.
 
<EOS>
for
God
's
sake
,
where
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
make
an
imploring
moan
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
think
better
that
his
old
housekeeper
should
give
him
Lady
Dedlock
's
letter
,
the
content
of
which
no
one
know
or
can
surmise
.
 
<EOS>
She
open
it
for
him
and
put
it
out
for
his
perusal
.
<EOS>
have
read
it
twice
by
a
great
effort
,
he
turn
it
down
so
that
it
shall
not
be
see
and
lie
moan
.
 
<EOS>
He
pass
into
a
kind
of
relapse
or
into
a
swoon
,
and
it
be
an
hour
before
he
open
his
eye
,
recline
on
his
faithful
and
attach
old
servant
's
arm
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
know
that
he
be
good
with
her
,
and
when
not
actively
engage
about
him
,
stand
aloof
.
   
<EOS>
the
slate
come
into
requisition
again
,
but
the
word
he
want
to
write
he
can
not
remember
.
 
<EOS>
His
anxiety
,
his
eagerness
,
and
affliction
at
this
pass
be
pitiable
to
behold
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
he
must
go
mad
in
the
necessity
he
feel
for
haste
and
the
inability
under
which
he
labour
of
express
to
do
what
or
to
fetch
whom

<EOS>
He
have
write
the
letter
B

and
there
stop

of
a
sudden

in
the
height

there

misconstrue
Sir

wish
to
see
him
or
the
desire
he

<EOS>
It
be

and
Mr

<EOS>
of
all

asleep
when

at

door

on

that

<EOS>
something
to
this
general
purpose
I
make
out
,
but
I
be
throw
into
such
a
tumult
of
alarm
,
and
hurry
and
distress
,
that
in
spite
of
every
effort
I
could
make
to
subdue
my
agitation
,
I
do
not
seem

to
myself
,
fully

recover
my

mind
until
hour
have
pass

<EOS>
but
I
dress
and
wrap
up
expeditiously
without
wake
Charley
or
any
one
and
go
down
to
Mr

,
who
be
the
person
entrust
with
the
secret
.
 
<EOS>
in
take
me
to
him

guardian
tell
me
this
,
and
also
explain
how
it
be
that
he
have
come
to
think
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bucket
,
in
a
low
voice
,
by
the
light
of
my
guardian
's
candle
,
read
to
me
in
the
hall
a
letter
that
my
mother
have
leave
upon
her
table
;
and
I
suppose
within
ten
minute
of
my
have
be
arouse
I
be
sit
beside
him
,
roll
swiftly
through
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
His
manner
be
very
keen
,
and
yet
considerate
when
he
explain
to
me
that
a
great
deal
may
depend
on
my
be
able
to
answer
,
without
confusion
,
a
few
question
that
he
wish
to
ask
me
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
,
chiefly
,
whether
I
have
have
much
communication
with
my
mother
(
to
whom
he
only
refer
as
Lady
Dedlock
)
,
when
and
where
I
have
speak
with
her
last
,
and
how
she
have
become
possessed
of
my
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
satisfy
him
on
these
point
,
he
ask
me
particularly
to
consider
---
take
time
to
think
---
whether
within
my
knowledge
there
be
any
one
,
no
matter
where
,
in
whom
she
may
be
at
all
likely
to
confide
under
circumstance
of
the
last
necessity
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
think
of
no
one
but
my
guardian
.
 
<EOS>
but
by
and
by
I
mention
Mr
Boythorn
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
into
my
mind
as
connect
with
his
old
chivalrous
manner
of
mention
my
mother
's
name
and
with
what
my
guardian
have
inform
me
of
his
engagement
to
her
sister
and
his
unconscious
connexion
with
her
unhappy
story
.
   
<EOS>
My
companion
have
stop
the
driver
while
we
hold
this
conversation
,
that
we
may
the
better
hear
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
He
now
tell
him
to
go
on
again
and
say
to
me
,
after
consider
within
himself
for
a
few
moment
,
that
he
have
make
up
his
mind
how
to
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
quite
willing
to
tell
me
what
his
plan
be
,
but
I
do
not
feel
clear
enough
to
understand
it

We
have
not
drive
very
far
from
our
lodging
when
we
stop
in
a
by
-
street
at
a
public
-
looking
place
light
up
with
gas
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bucket
take
me
in
and
sit
me
in
an
armchair
by
a
bright
fire
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
past
one
,
as
I
see
by
the
clock
against
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
two
police
officer
,
look
in
their
perfectly
neat
uniform
not
at
all
like
people
who
be
up
all
night
,
be
quietly
write
at
a
desk
;
and
the
place
seem
very
quiet
altogether
,
except
for
some
beating
and
call
out
at
distant
door
underground
,
to
which
nobody
pay
any
attention
.
   
<EOS>
a
third
man
in
uniform
,
whom
Mr
Bucket
call
and
to
whom
he
whisper
his
instruction
,
go
out
;
and
then
the
two
other
advise
together
while
one
write
from
Mr
Bucket
's
subdued
dictation
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
description
of
my
mother
that
they
be
busy
with
,
for
Mr
Bucket
bring
it
to
me
when
it
be
do
and
read
it
in
a
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
accurate
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
the
second
officer
,
who
have
attend
to
it
closely
,
then
copy
it
out
and
call
in
another
man
in
uniform
(
there
be
several
in
an
outer
room
)
,
who
take
it
up
and
go
away
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
be
do
with
the
great
dispatch
and
without
the
waste
of
a
moment
;
yet
nobody
be
at
all
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
paper
be
send
out
upon
its
travel
,
the
two
officer
resume
their
former
quiet
work
of
write
with
neatness
and
care
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bucket
thoughtfully
come
and
warm
the
sol
of
his
boot
,
first
one
and
then
the
other
,
at
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
be
you
well
wrap
up
,
Miss
Summerson
?
<EOS>
"
he
ask
me
as
his
eye
meet
mine
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
desperate
sharp
night
for
a
young
lady
to
be
out
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
care
for
no
weather
and
be
warmly
clothe
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
a
long
job
,
"
he
observe
;
"
but
so
that
it
end
well
<EOS>
,
never
mind
,
miss
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
pray
to
heaven
it
may
end
well
!
"
say
I.
   
He
nod
comfortingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
whatever
you
do
,
do
not
you
go
and
fret
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
You
keep
yourself
cool
and
equal
for
anything
that
may
happen
,
and
it
will
be
the
well
for
you
,
the
well
for
me
,
the
well
for
Lady
Dedlock
,
and
the
well
for
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
,
Baronet
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
be
really
very
kind
and
gentle
,
and
as
he
stand
before
the
fire
warm
his
boot
and
rub
his
face
with
his
forefinger
,
I
feel
a
confidence
in
his
sagacity
which
reassure
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
yet
a
quarter
to
two
when
I
hear
horse
'
foot
and
wheel
outside
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
Miss
Summerson
,
"
say
he
,
"
we
be
off
,
if
you
please
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
give
me
his
arm
,
and
the
two
officer
courteously
bow
me
out
,
and
we
find
at
the
door
a
phaeton
or
barouche
with
a
postilion
and
post
horse
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bucket
hand
me
in
and
take
his
own
seat
on
the
box
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
in
uniform
whom
he
have
send
to
fetch
this
equipage
then
hand
him
up
a
dark
lantern
at
his
request
,
and
when
he
have
give
a
few
direction
to
the
driver
,
we
rattle
away
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
far
from
sure
that
I
be
not
in
a
dream
.
 
<EOS>
We
rattle
with
great
rapidity
through
such
a
labyrinth
of
street
that
I
soon
lose
all
idea
where
we
be
,
except
that
we
have
cross
and
re
-
cross
the
river
,
and
still
seem
to
be
traverse
a
low
-
lying
,
waterside
,
dense
neighbourhood
of
narrow
thoroughfare
chequer
by
dock
and
basin
,
high
pile
of
warehouse
,
swing
-
bridge
,
and
mast
of
ship
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
we
stop
at
the
corner
of
a
little
slimy
turning
,
which
the
wind
from
the
river
,
rush
up
it
,
do
not
purify
;
and
I
see
my
companion
,
by
the
light
of
his
lantern
,
in
conference
with
several
man
who
look
like
a
mixture
of
police
and
sailor
.
 
<EOS>
against
the
mouldering
wall
by
which
they
stand
,
there
be
a
bill
,
on
which
I
could
discern
the
word
,
"
Found
drowned
"
;
and
this
and
an
inscription
about
drag
possess
me
with
the
awful
suspicion
shadow
forth
in
our
visit
to
that
place
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
no
need
to
remind
myself
that
I
be
not
there
by
the
indulgence
of
any
feeling
of
mine
to
increase
the
difficulty
of
the
search
,
or
to
lessen
its
hope
,
or
enhance
its
delay
.
 
<EOS>
I
remain
quiet
,
but
what
I
suffer
in
that
dreadful
spot
I
never
can
forget
.
 
<EOS>
and
still
it
be
like
the
horror
of
a
dream
.
 
<EOS>
a
man
yet
dark
and
muddy
,
in
long
swollen
sodden
boot
and
a
hat
like
them
,
be
call
out
of
a
boat
and
whisper
with
Mr
Bucket
,
who
go
away
with
him
down
some
slippery
step
---
as
if
to
look
at
something
secret
that
he
have
to
show
.
 
<EOS>
They
come
back
,
wipe
their
hand
upon
their
coat
,
after
turn
over
something
wet
;
but
thank
God
it
be
not
what
I
fear
!
   
<EOS>
after
some
further
conference
,
Mr
Bucket
(
whom
everybody
seem
to
know
and
defer
to
)
go
in
with
the
other
at
a
door
and
leave
me
in
the
carriage
,
while
the
driver
walk
up
and
down
by
his
horse
to
warm
himself
.
 
<EOS>
the
tide
be
come
in
,
as
I
judge
from
the
sound
it
make
,
and
I
could
hear
it
break
at
the
end
of
the
alley
with
a
little
rush
towards
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
never
do
so
---
<EOS>
and
I
think
it
do
so
,
<EOS>
hundred
of
time
,
in
what
can
have
be
at
the
most
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
probably
be
less
---
but
the
thought
shudder
through
me
that
it
would
cast
my
mother
at
the
horse
'
foot
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bucket
come
out
again
,
exhort
the
other
to
be
vigilant
,
darken
his
lantern
,
and
once
more
take
his
seat
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
be
alarm
,
Miss
Summerson
,
on
account
of
our
come
down
here
,
"
he
say
,
turn
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
only
want
to
have
everything
in
train
and
to
know
that
it
be
in
train
by
look
after
it
myself
.
 
<EOS>
get
on
,
my
lad
!
"
   
<EOS>
We
appear
to
retrace
the
way
we
have
come
.
 
<EOS>
not
that
I
have
take
note
of
any
particular
object
in
my
perturbed
state
of
mind
,
but
judge
from
the
general
character
of
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
We
call
at
another
office
or
station
for
a
minute
and
cross
the
river
again
.
<EOS>
during
the
whole
of
this
time
,
and
during
the
whole
search
,
my
companion
,
wrap
up
on
the
box
,
never
relaxed
in
his
vigilance
a
single
moment
;
but
when
we
cross
the
bridge
he
seem
,
if
possible
,
to
be
more
on
the
alert
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
stand
up
to
look
over
the
parapet
,
he
alight
and
go
back
after
a
shadowy
female
figure
that
flit
past
us
,
and
he
gaze
into
the
profound
black
pit
of
water
with
a
face
that
make
my
heart
die
within
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
river
have
a
fearful
look
,
so
overcast
and
secret
,
creep
away
so
fast
between
the
low
flat
line
of
shore
---
so
heavy
with
indistinct
and
awful
shape
,
both
of
substance
and
shadow
;
so
death
-
like
and
mysterious
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
it
many
time
since
then
,
by
sunlight
and
by
moonlight
,
but
never
free
from
the
impression
of
that
journey
.
<EOS>
in
my
memory
the
light
upon
the
bridge
be
always
burn
dim
,
the
cut
wind
be
eddy
round
the
homeless
woman
whom
we
pass
,
the
monotonous
wheel
be
whirl
on
,
and
the
light
of
the
carriage
-
lamp
reflect
back
look
palely
in
upon
me
---
a
face
rise
out
of
the
dreaded
water
.
   
<EOS>
clattering
and
clatter
through
the
empty
street
<EOS>
,
we
come
at
length
from
the
pavement
on
to
dark
smooth
road
and
begin
to
leave
the
house
behind
us
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
while
I
recognize
the
familiar
way
to
Saint
Albans
.
 
<EOS>
at
Barnet
fresh
horse
be
ready
for
us
,
and
we
change
and
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
cold
indeed
,
and
the
open
country
be
white
with
snow
,
though
none
be
fall
then
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
an
old
acquaintance
of
yours
,
this
road
,
Miss
Summerson
,
"
say
Mr
Bucket
cheerfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
"
I
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
you
gather
any
intelligence
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
none
that
can
be
quite
depend
on
as
yet
,
"
he
answer
,
"
but
it
be
early
time
as
yet
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
have
go
into
every
late
or
early
public
-
house
where
there
be
a
light
<EOS>
(
they
be
not
a
few
at
that
time
,
the
road
be
then
much
frequent
by
drover
)
and
have
get
down
to
talk
to
the
turnpike
-
keeper
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hear
him
order
drink
,
and
chink
money
,
and
make
himself
agreeable
and
merry
everywhere
;
but
whenever
he
take
his
seat
upon
the
box
again
,
his
face
resume
its
watchful
steady
look
,
and
he
always
say
to
the
driver
in
the
same
business
tone
,
"
get
on
,
my
lad
!
"
   
<EOS>
with
all
these
stoppage
,
it
be
between
five
and
six
o'clock
<EOS>
and
we
be
yet
a
few
mile
short
of
Saint
Albans
when
he
come
out
of
one
of
these
house
and
hand
me
in
a
cup
of
tea
.
   
<EOS>
"
drink
it
,
Miss
Summerson
,
it
will
do
you
good
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
begin
to
get
more
yourself
now
,
be
not
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
thank
him
and
say
I
hope
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
be
what
you
may
call
stunned
at
first
,
"
he
return
;
"
and
Lord
,
no
wonder
!
 
<EOS>
do
not
speak
loud
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
all
right
.
<EOS>
She
be
on
ahead
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
joyful
exclamation
I
make
or
be
go
to
make
,
but
he
put
up
his
finger
and
I
stop
myself
.
   
<EOS>
"
pass
through
here
on
foot
this
evening
about
eight
or
nine
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
of
her
first
at
the
archway
toll
,
over
at
Highgate
,
but
could
not
make
quite
sure
.
 
<EOS>
trace
her
all
along
,
on
and
off
.
<EOS>
pick
her
up
at
one
place
,
and
drop
her
at
another
;
but
she
be
before
us
now
,
safe
.
 
<EOS>
take
hold
of
this
cup
and
saucer
,
ostler
.
<EOS>
now
,
if
you
be
not
bring
up
to
the
butter
trade
,
look
out
and
see
if
you
can
catch
half
a
crown
in
your
t'other
hand
.
 
<EOS>
one
,
two
,
three
,
and
there
you
be
!
 
<EOS>
now
,
my
lad
,
try
a
gallop
!
"
   
<EOS>
We
be
soon
in
Saint
Albans
and
alight
a
little
before
day
,
when
I
be
just
begin
to
arrange
and
comprehend
the
occurrence
of
the
night
and
really
to
believe
that
they
be
not
a
dream
.
<EOS>
leave
the
carriage
at
the
posting
-
house
and
order
fresh
horse
to
be
ready
,
my
companion
give
me
his
arm
,
and
we
go
towards
home
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
this
be
your
regular
abode
,
Miss
Summerson
<EOS>
,
you
see
,
"
he
observe
,
"
I
should
like
to
know
whether
you
have
be
ask
for
by
any
stranger
answer
the
description
,
or
whether
Mr
Jarndyce
have
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
much
expect
it
,
but
it
may
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
as
we
ascend
the
hill
,
he
look
about
him
with
a
sharp
eye
---
the
day
be
now
break
---
and
remind
me
that
I
have
come
down
it
one
night
,
as
I
have
reason
for
remember
,
with
my
little
servant
and
poor
Jo
,
whom
he
call
Toughey
.
   
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
he
know
that
.
   
<EOS>
"
when
you
pass
a
man
upon
the
road
,
just
yonder
,
you
know
,
"
say
Mr
Bucket
.
   
<EOS>
yes
,
I
remember
that
too
,
very
well
.
   
<EOS>
"
that
be
me
,
"
say
Mr
Bucket
.
   
<EOS>
see
my
surprise
,
he
go
on
,
"
I
drive
down
in
a
gig
that
afternoon
to
look
after
that
boy
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
have
hear
my
wheel
when
you
come
out
to
look
after
him
yourself
,
for
I
be
aware
of
you
and
your
little
maid
go
up
when
I
be
walk
the
horse
down
.
 
<EOS>
make
an
inquiry
or
two
about
him
in
the
town
,
I
soon
hear
what
company
he
be
in
and
be
come
among
the
brick
-
field
to
look
for
him
when
I
observe
you
bring
him
home
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
have
he
commit
any
crime
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
   
<EOS>
"
none
be
charge
against
him
,
"
say
Mr
Bucket
,
coolly
lift
off
his
hat
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
suppose
he
be
not
over
-
particular
.
 
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
what
I
want
him
for
be
in
connexion
with
keep
this
very
matter
of
Lady
Dedlock
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
make
his
tongue
more
free
than
welcome
as
to
a
small
accidental
service
he
have
be
pay
for
by
the
deceased
Mr
Tulkinghorn
;
and
it
would
not
do
,
at
any
sort
of
price
,
to
have
him
play
those
game
.
 
<EOS>
so
have
warn
him
out
of
London
,
I
make
an
afternoon
of
it
to
warn
him
to
keep
out
of
it
now
<EOS>
he
be
away
,
and
go
farther
from
it
,
and
maintain
a
bright
look
-
out
that
I
do
not
catch
him
come
back
again
.

trouble
enough

well
enough
away

I

up
by
your

I
do
assure
you

I
ask
him
why

"
why
,
my
dear
?
"
say
Mr
Bucket

<EOS>
"
naturally
there
be
no
end
to
his
tongue

He
may
as
well
have
be
bear
with
a
yard
and
a
half
of
it
,
and
a
remnant
over
.
"
   
<EOS>
although
I
remember
this
conversation
now
,
my
head
be
in
confusion
at
the
time
,
and
my
power
of
attention
hardly
do
more
than
enable
me
to
understand
that
he
enter
into
these
particular
to
divert
me
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
same
kind
intention
,
manifestly
,
he
often
speak
to
me
of
indifferent
thing
,
while
his
face
be
busy
with
the
one
object
that
we
have
in
view
.
 
<EOS>
He
still
pursue
this
subject
as
we
turn
in
at
the
garden
-
gate
.
   
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
say
Mr
Bucket
.
 
<EOS>
"
here
we
be
,
and
a
nice
retire
place
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
put
a
man
in
mind
of
the
country
house
in
the
Woodpecker
-
tapping
,
that
be
know
by
the
smoke
which
so
gracefully
curl
.
<EOS>
They
be
early
with
the
kitchen
fire
,
and
that
denote
good
servant
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
you
have
always
get
to
be
careful
of
with
servant
<EOS>
be
who
come
to
see
'em
;
you
never
know
what
they
be
up
to
if
you
do
not
know
that
.
 
<EOS>
and
another
thing
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
whenever
you
find
a
young
man
behind
the
kitchen
-
door
,
you
give
that
young
man
in
charge
on
suspicion
of
be
secrete
in
a
dwelling

house
with
an
unlawful
purpose
.
"
   
<EOS>
We
be
now
in
front
of
the
house
;
he
look
attentively
and
closely
at
the
gravel
for
footprint
before
he
raise
his
eye
to
the
window
.
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
generally
put
that
elderly
young
gentleman
in
the
same
room
when
he
be
on
a
visit
here
,
Miss
Summerson
?
<EOS>
"
he
inquire
,
glance
at
Mr
Skimpole
's
usual
chamber
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
Mr

I.

what
do
you

Mr

bend
down
his
ear

Skimpole

be
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
wonder
what
his
name
may
be

<EOS>
Skimpole

not
John

I
should
say
,

Harold

I
tell

Harold

<EOS>
yes

He
be
a
queer
bird

Harold

Mr

eye
me
with
great
expression

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
a
singular
character

I.
   
<EOS>
"
no
idea

money

observe
Mr
Bucket
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
take
it
,
though
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
involuntarily
return
for
answer
that
I
perceive
Mr
Bucket
know
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
now
I
will
tell
you
,
Miss
Summerson
,
"
he
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
mind
will
be
all
the
well
for
not
run
on
one
point
too
continually
,
and
I
will
tell
you
for
a
change
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
him
as
point
out
to
me
where
Toughey
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
up
my
mind
that
night
to
come
to
the
door
and
ask
for
Toughey
,
if
that
be
all
;
but
willing
to
try
a
move
or
so
first
,
if
any
such
be
on
the
board
,
I
just
pitch
up
a
morsel
of
gravel
at
that
window
where
I
see
a
shadow
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Harold
open
it
and
I
have
have
a
look
at
him
,
think
I
,
you
be
the
man
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
smooth
him
down
a
bit
about
not
want
to
disturb
the
family
after
they
be
go
to
bed
and
about
its
be
a
thing
to
be
regret
that
charitable
young
lady
should
harbour
vagrant
;
and
then
,
when
I
pretty
well
understand
his
way
,
I
say
I
should
consider
a
fypunnote
well
bestow
if
I
could
relieve
the
premise
of
Toughey
without
cause
any
noise
or
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
then
say
he
,
lift
up
his
eyebrow
in
the
gay
way
,
<EOS>
"
It
be
no
use
menfione
a
fypunnote
to
me
,
my
friend
,
because
I
be
a
mere
child
in
such
matter
and
have
no
idea
of
money
.
"
 
<EOS>
of
course
I
understand
what
his
take
it
so
easy
mean
;
and
be
now
quite
sure
he
be
the
man
for
me
,
I
wrap
the
note
round
a
little
stone
and
throw
it
up
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
He
laugh
and
beam
,
and
look
as
innocent
as
you
like
,
and
say
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
know
the
value
of
these
thing
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
I
to
do
with
this
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
spend
it
,
sir
,
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
shall
be
take
in
,
"
he
say
,
"
they
will
not
give
me
the
right
change
<EOS>
,
I
shall
lose
it
,
it
be
no
use
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Lord
,
you
never
see
such
a
face
as
he
carry
it
with
!
 
<EOS>
of
course
he
tell
me
where
to
find
Toughey
,
and
I
find
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
regard
this
as
very
treacherous
on
the
part
of
Mr
Skimpole
towards
my
guardian
and
as
pass
the
usual
bound
of
his
childish
innocence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bounds
,
my
dear
?
"
return
Mr
Bucket
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bounds
?
 
<EOS>
now
,
Miss
Summerson
,
I
will
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
that
your
husband
will
find
useful
when
you
be
happily
married
and
have
get
a
family
about
you
.
 
<EOS>
whenever
a
person
say
to
you
that
they
be
as
innocent
as
can
be
in
all
concern
money
,
look
well
after
your
own
money
,
for
they
be
dead
certain
to
collar
it
if
they
can
.
 
<EOS>
whenever
a
person
proclaim
to
you
"
in
worldly
matter
I
be
a
child
,
"
you
consider
that
that
person
be
only
a
-
cry
off
from
be
hold
accountable
and
that
you
have
get
that
person
's
number
,
and
it
be
Number
One
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
I
be
not
a
poetical
man
myself
,
except
in
a
vocal
way
when
it
go
round
a
company
,
but
I
be
a
practical
one
,
and
that
be
my
experience
.
 
<EOS>
so
be
this
rule
.
 
<EOS>
fast
and
loose
in
one
thing
,
fast
and
loose
in
everything
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
know
it
fail
.
 
<EOS>
no
more
will
you
.
 
<EOS>
nor
no
one
.
 
<EOS>
with
which
caution
to
the
unwary
,
my
dear
,
I
take
the
liberty
of
pull
this
here
bell
,
and
so
go
back
to
our
business
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
believe
it
have
not
be
for
a
moment
out
of
his
mind
,
any
more
than
it
have
be
out
of
my
mind
,
or
out
of
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
household
be
amazed
to
see
me
,
without
any
notice
,
at
that
time
in
the
morning
,
and
so
accompanied
;
and
their
surprise
be
not
diminish
by
my
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
no
one
,
however
,
have
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
doubt
that
this
be
the
truth
.
   
<EOS>
"
then
,
Miss
Summerson
,
"
say
my
companion
,
"
we
can
not
be
too
soon
at
the
cottage
where
those
brickmaker
be
to
be
find
.
 
<EOS>
Most
inquiry
there
<EOS>
I
leave
to
you
,
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
make
'em
.
 
<EOS>
the
natural
way
be
the
good
way
,
and
the
natural
way
be
your
own
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
We
set
off
again
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
on
arrive
at
the
cottage
,
we
find
it
shut
up
and
apparently
desert
,
but
one
of
the
neighbour
who
know
me
and
who
come
out
when
I
be
try
to
make
some
one
hear
inform
me
that
the
two
woman
and
their
husband
now
live
together
in
another
house
,
make
of
loose
rough
brick
,
which
stand
on
the
margin
of
the
piece
of
ground
where
the
kiln
be
and
where
the
long
row
of
brick
be
dry

<EOS>
We
lose
no
time
in
repair
to
this
place
,
which
be
within
a
few
hundred
yard
;
and
as
the
door
stand
ajar
,
I
push
it
open
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
only
three
of
them
sit
at
breakfast
,
the
child
lie
asleep
on
a
bed
in
the
corner
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Jenny
,
the
mother
of
the
dead
child
,
who
be
absent
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
woman
rise
on
see
me
;
and
the
man
,
though
they
be
,
as
usual
,
sulky
and
silent
,
each
give
me
a
morose
nod
of
recognition
.
 
<EOS>
a
look
pass
between
them
when
Mr
Bucket
follow
me
in
,
and
I
be
surprised
to
see
that
the
woman
evidently
know
him
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
ask
leave
to
enter
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
Liz
(
the
only
name
by
which
I
know
her
)
rise
to
give
me
her
own
chair
,
but
I
sit
down
on
a
stool
near
the
fire
,
and
Mr
Bucket
take
a
corner
of
the
bedstead
.
<EOS>
now
that
I
have
to
speak
and
be
among
people
with
whom
I
be
not
familiar
,
I
become
conscious
of
be
hurried
and
giddy
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
difficult
to
begin
,
and
I
could
not
help
burst
into
tear
.
   
<EOS>
"
Liz
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
have
come
a
long
way

make
a
surly
stop
in

eating
to
listen
and
now
measure
him
with
his
eye

have
not

her
chair

stand
falter
with
her
hand
upon
its
break
back
,
look
at
me

I
think
she
would
have
speak
to
me
privately

She
be
still
in
this
attitude
of
uncertainty

He
leave

<EOS>
I
glance
at
my

find
that

have
already
rise

be
ready

depart

thank
them
for
what
they
have
tell

take

the

full
at

look
full
at

to
me

You
see

I
exclaim
.
   
<EOS>
"
just
as
good
as
see
it

he
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
else
why
should
he
talk
about
his
"
twenty
minute

about
his

no
watch

tell
the
time
by

<EOS>
twenty
minute

<EOS>
He
do
not
usually
cut
his
time
so
fine
as
that
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
come
to
half
-
hour
,
it
be
as
much
as
he
do
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
you
see
,
either
her
ladyship
give
him
that
watch
<EOS>

he
take
it

I
think
she
give
it
him

now

what
should
she
give

him
for

<EOS>
what
should
she
give
it
him
for

"
   
<EOS>
He
repeat
this
question
to
himself
several
time
as
we
hurry
on
,
appear
to
balance
between
a
variety
of
answer
that
arise
in
his
mind
.
   
<EOS>
"
if
time
could
be
spare
,
"
say
Mr
Bucket
,
"
which
be
the
only
thing
that
can
not
be
spare
in
this
case
<EOS>
,
I
may
get
it
out
of
that
woman
;
but
it
be
too
doubtful
a
chance
to
trust
to
under
present
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
up
to
keep
a
close
eye
upon
her
,
and
any
fool
know
that
a
poor
creetur
like
her
,
beat
and
kick
and
scar
and
bruise
from
head
to
foot

will
stand
by
the
husband
that
ill
use
her
through
thick
and
thin
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
keep
back
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
but
<EOS>
what
we
have
see
the
other
woman
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
regret
it
exceedingly
,
for
she
be
very
grateful
,
and
I
feel
sure
would
have
resist
no
entreaty
of
mine
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
possible
,
Miss
Summerson
,
"
say
Mr
Bucket
,
ponder
on
it
,
"
that
her
ladyship
send
her
up
to
London
with
some
word
for
you
,
and
it
be
possible
that
her
husband
get
the
watch
to
let
her
go
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
not
come
out
altogether
so
plain
as
to
please
me
,
but
it
be
on
the
card
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
I
do
not
take
kindly
to
lay
out
the
money
of
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
,
Baronet
,
on
these
rough
,
and
I
do
not
see
my
way
to
the
usefulness
of
it
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
no
!
 
<EOS>
so
far
our
road
,
Miss
Summerson
,
be
for'ard

straight
ahead
---
and
keep
everything
quiet
!
"
   
<EOS>
We
call
at
home
once
more
that
I
may
send
a
hasty
note
to
my
guardian
,
and
then
we
hurry
back
to
where
we
have
leave
the
carriage
.
 
<EOS>
the
horse
be
bring
out
as
soon
as
we
be
see
come
,
and
we
be
on
the
road
again
in
a
few
minute
.
   
<EOS>
It
have
set
in
snow
at
daybreak
,
and
it
now
snow
hard
.
 
<EOS>
the
air
be
so
thick
with
the
darkness
of
the
day
and
the
density
of
the
fall
that
we
could
see
but
a
very
little
way
in
any
direction
.
<EOS>
although
it
be
extremely
cold
,
the
snow
be
but
partially
frozen
,
and
it
churn
---
with
a
sound
as
if
it
be
a
beach
of
small
shell
 
---
under
the
hoofs
of
the
horse
into
mire
and
water
.
 
<EOS>
They
sometimes
slip
and
flounder
for
a
mile
together
,
and
we
be
oblige
to
come
to
a
standstill
to
rest
them
.
 
<EOS>
one
horse
fall
three
time
in
this
first
stage
,
and
tremble
so
and
be
so
shaken
that
the
driver
have
to
dismount
from
his
saddle
and
lead
him
at
last
.
   
<EOS>
I
could
eat
nothing
and
could
not
sleep
,
and
I
grow
so
nervous
under
those
delay
and
the
slow
pace
at
which
we
travel
that
I
have
an
unreasonable
desire
upon
me
to
get
out
and
walk
.
 
<EOS>
yield
to
my
companion
's
well
sense
,
however
,
I
remain
where
I
be
.
<EOS>
all
this
time
,
keep
fresh
by
a
certain
enjoyment
of
the
work
in
which
he
be
engage
,
he
be
up
and
down
at
every
house
we
come
to
,
address
people
whom
he
have
never
behold
before
as
old
acquaintance
,
run
in
to
warm
himself
at
every
fire
he
see
,
talk
and
drink
and
shake
hand
at
every
bar
and
tap
,
friendly
with
every
waggoner
,
wheelwright
,
blacksmith
,
and
toll
-
taker
,
yet
never
seem
to
lose
time
,
and
always
mount
to
the
box
again
with
his
watchful
,
steady
face
and
his
business
-
like
"
get
on
,
my
lad
!
"
   
<EOS>
when
we
be
change
horse
the
next
time
,
he
come
from
the
stable
-
yard
,
with
the
wet
snow
encrust
upon
him
and
drop
off
him
---
plash
and
crash
through
it
to
his
wet
knee
as
he
have
be
do
frequently
since
we
leave
Saint
Albans
---
and
speak
to
me
at
the
carriage
side
.
   
<EOS>
"
keep
up
your
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
true
that
she
come
on
here
,
Miss
Summerson
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
doubt
of
the
dress
by
this
time

the
dress
have
be
see
here

<EOS>
"
still
on
foot

"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
still
on
foot

<EOS>
I
think
the
gentleman
you
mention
must
be
the
point
she
be
aim
at
,
<EOS>
and
yet
I
do
not
like
his
live
down
in
her
own
part
of
the
country
neither

<EOS>
"
I
know
so
little

I.

there
may
be
some
one

of
whom
I
never

that
be
true

<EOS>
but
whatever
you
do
,
do
not
you
fall
a
-
crying
,
my
dear
;
and
do
not
you
worry
yourself
no
more
than
you
can
help
.
 
<EOS>
get
on
,
my
lad
!
"
   
<EOS>
the
sleet
fall
all
that
day
unceasingly
,
a
thick
mist
come
on
early
,
and
it
never
rise
or
lighten
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
such
road
<EOS>
I
have
never
see
.
 
<EOS>
I
sometimes
fear
we
have
miss
the
way
and
get
into
the
ploughed
ground
or
the
marsh
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
ever
think
of
the
time
I
have
be
out
,
it
present
itself
as
an
indefinite
period
of
great
duration
,
and
I
seem
,
in
a
strange
way
,
never
to
have
be
free
from
the
anxiety
under
which
I
then
labour
.
   
<EOS>
as
we
advance
,
I
begin
to
feel
misgiving
that
my
companion
lose
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
the
same
as
before
with
all
the
roadside
people
,
but
he
look
graver
when
he
sit
by
himself
on
the
box
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
his
finger
uneasily
go
across
and
across
his
mouth
during
the
whole
of
one
long
weary
stage
.
 
<EOS>
I
overhear
that
he
begin
to
ask
the
driver
of
coach
and
other
vehicle
come
towards
us
what
passenger
they
have
see
in
other
coach
and
vehicle
that
be
in
advance
.
 
<EOS>
Their
reply
do
not
encourage
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
always
give
me
a
reassuring
beck
of
his
finger
and
lift
of
his
eyelid
as
he
get
upon
the
box
again
,
but
he
seem
perplexed
now
when
he
say
,
"
get
on
,
my
lad
!
"
   
<EOS>
at
last
,
when
we
be
change
,
he
tell
me
that
he
have
lose
the
track
of
the
dress
so
long
that
he
begin
to
be
surprised
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
nothing
,
he
say
,
to
lose
such
a
track
for
one
while
,
and
to
take
it
up
for
another
while
,
and
so
on
;
but
it
have
disappear
here
in
an
unaccountable
manner
,
and
we
have
not
come
upon
it
since
.
 
<EOS>
this
corroborate
the
apprehension
I
have
form
,
when
he
begin
to
look
at
direction
-
post
,
and
to
leave
the
carriage
at
cross
road
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
a
time
while
he
explore
them
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
to
be
down
-
hearted
,
he
tell
me
,
for
it
be
as
likely
as
not
that
the
next
stage
may
set
us
right
again
.
   
<EOS>
the
next
stage
,
however
,
end
as
that
one
end
;
we
have
no
new
clue
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
spacious
inn
here
,
solitary
,
but
a
comfortable
substantial
building
,
and
as
we
drive
in
under
a
large
gateway
before
I
know
it
,
where
a
landlady
and
her
pretty
daughter
come
to
the
carriage
-
door
,
entreat
me
to
alight
and
refresh
myself
while
the
horse
be
make
ready
,
I
think
it
would
be
uncharitable
to
refuse
.
 
<EOS>
They
take
me
upstairs
to
a
warm
room
and
leave
me
there
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
at
the
corner
of
the
house
,
I
remember
,
look
two
way
.
<EOS>
on
one
side
to
a
stable
-
yard
open
to
a
by
-
road
,
where
the
ostler
be
unharness
the
splashed
and
tired
horse
from
the
muddy
carriage
,
and
beyond
that
to
the
by
-
road
itself
,
across
which
the
sign
be
heavily
swinge
;
on
the
other
side
to
a
wood
of
dark
pine
-
tree
.
 
<EOS>
Their
branch
be
encumber
with
snow
,
and
it
silently
drop
off
in
wet
heap
while
I
stand
at
the
window
.
<EOS>
night
be
set
in
,
and
its
bleakness
be
enhance
by
the
contrast
of
the
picture
fire
glowing
and
gleam
in
the
window
-
pane
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
look
among
the
stem
of
the
tree
and
follow
the
discolour
mark
in
the
snow
where
the
thaw
be
sink
into
it
and
undermine
it
,
I
think
of
the
motherly
face
brightly
set
off
by
daughter
that
have
just
now
welcome
me
and
of
my
mother
lie
down
in
such
a
wood
to
die
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
frightened
when
I
find
them
all
about
me
,
but
I
remember
that
before
I
faint
I
try
very
hard
not
to
do
it
;
and
that
be
some
little
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
They
cushion
me
up
on
a
large
sofa
by
the
fire
,
and
then
the
comely
landlady
tell
me
that
I
must
travel
no
further
to
-
night
,
but
must
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
put
me
into
such
a
tremble
lest
they
should
detain
me
there
that
she
soon
recall
her
word
and
compromise
for
a
rest
of
half
an
hour
.
   
<EOS>
a
good
endearing
creature
she
be
.
 
<EOS>
She
and
her
three
fair
girl
,
all
so
busy
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to
take
hot
soup
and
broil
fowl
,
while
Mr
Bucket
dry
himself
and
dine
elsewhere
;
but
I
could
not
do
it
when
a
snug
round
table
be
presently
spread
by
the
fireside
,
though
I
be
very
unwilling
to
disappoint
them
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
could
take
some
toast
and
some
hot
negus
,
and
as
I
really
enjoy
that
refreshment
,
it
make
some
recompense
.
   
<EOS>
punctual
to
the
time
,
at
the
half

hour

end
the
carriage

rumble
under
the
gateway

and
they
take
me
down
,
warm
,
refresh
,
comfort
by
kindness
,
and
safe
(
I
assure
them
)
not

faint
any
more

<EOS>
after
I
have
get
in
and
have
take
a
grateful
leave
of
them
all
,
the
young
daughter

and
kiss
me

<EOS>
I
have
never

from
that
hour

I

of

to
this
hour
as
my

again
we

crush
and
churn
the
loose
snow

<EOS>
We
go
on
with
toil
enough
,

the
dismal
road

not

bad
than
they
have
be
,
and
the
stage
be
only
nine
mile

<EOS>
My

I

when
I

him
stand
at
a
great
fire
in
a

cloud

be
as
vigilant
as
ever

as
quickly
down

up
again
when

any
human
abode

He

there

We

I
look
at

anxiously

almost

in

<EOS>
He

It

that

He

when

<EOS>
George
,
with
a
look
of
assent
and
sympathy
,
make
another
bow
.
 
<EOS>
the
different
time
when
they
be
both
young
man
(
the
trooper
much
the
young
of
the
two
)
and
look
at
one
another
down
at
Chesney
Wold
arise
before
them
both
and
soften
both
.
   
<EOS>
Sir
Leicester

evidently
with
a
great
determination
to
say
,
in
his
own
manner
,
something
that
be
on
his
mind
before
relapse
into
silence
,
try
to
raise
himself
among
his
pillow
a
little
more
.
<EOS>
George
,
observant
of
the
action
,
take
him
in
his
arm
again
and
place
him
as
he
desire
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
"
thank

He
have
put
Sir

over

him
up

Sir

I
be
about

I
be
about
to
add

respect
this
attack
,
that
it
be
unfortunately
simultaneous
with
a
slight
misunderstanding
between
my
Lady
and
myself

<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
that
there
be
any
difference
between
us
(
for
there
have
be
none

that
there
be
a
misunderstanding

certain
circumstance
important
only

perfectly

in
truth

deliver
himself
with
far
great

the

silently

<EOS>
Volumnia
tremblingly
protest
that

will
observe
his
injunction
to
the
letter

"
My

at

<EOS>
His
noble
earnestness

his
fidelity

gallant
shielding
of
her

his
generous
conquest
of
his

true

by
his
exertion

he
lay
his
head
back
on
his
pillow

close
his
eye
for
not
more
than
a
minute
,
when
he
again
resume
his
watching
of
the
weather

his
attention
to
the
muffle
sound

in
the

I

take
the
freedom

me
draw
the

make
thing
more
comfortable
about

the
church

clock
will
strike
the
hour
just
the

Sir

and
the

<EOS>
"
not

<EOS>
not

He

it
with
a

<EOS>
She
know
that
this
be
not
a

for
bring
the
rough
light
upon
him
;
she
think
his
tear
too
sacred

be

even
by
her

<EOS>
therefore
she
sit
in
the
darkness
for
a
while
without
a
word

then
gently
begin

move
about

now
stir
the

<EOS>
when
it
be
light

the
weather
shut
out

it
be
only
leave
to
him
to
listen

<EOS>
but
they
find
that
however
dejected

ill
<EOS>
he
be
,
he
brighten
when
a
quiet
pretence

make
of
look
at
the
fire
in
her
room

be
sure
that
everything
be
ready

<EOS>
poor
pretence
as
it
be

these
allusion
to
her

keep
up
hope
within
him
.
   
<EOS>
midnight
come
,
and
with
it
the
same
blank
.
 
<EOS>
the
carriage
in
the
street
be
few
,
and
other
late
sound
in
that
neighbourhood
there
be
none

unless
a
man
so
very
nomadically
drunk
as
to
stray
into
the
frigid
zone
go
brawling
and
bellow
along
the
pavement
.
<EOS>
upon
this
wintry
night
it
be
so
still
that
listen
to
the
intense
silence
be
like
look
at
intense
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
if
any
distant
sound
be
audible
in
this
case
,
it
depart
through
the
gloom
like
a
feeble
light
in
that
,
and
all
be
heavy
than
before

<EOS>
the
corporation
of
servant
be
dismiss
to
bed
(
not
unwilling
to
go
,
for
they
be
up
all
last
night

,
and
only
Mrs
Rouncewell
and
George
keep
watch
in
Sir
Leicester
's
room
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
night
lag
tardily
on
---
or
rather
when
it
seem
to
stop
altogether
,
at
between
two
and
three
o'clock
---
they
find
a
restless
craving
on
him
to
know
more
about
the
weather
,
now
he
can
not
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
hence
George
,
patrol
regularly
every
half
-
hour
to
the
room
so
carefully
look
after
,
extend
his
march
to
the
hall
-
door
,
look
about
him
,
and
bring
back
the
good
report
he
can
make
of
the
bad
of
night
,
the
sleet
still
fall
and
even
the
stone
footway
lie
ankle
-
deep
in
icy
sludge

<EOS>
Volumnia
,
in
her
room
up
a
retire
landing
on

case
---
the
second
turning
past
the
end
of

carving
and
gilding

a
cousinly
room
contain
a
fearful
abortion
of
a
portrait
of
Sir
Leicester
banish
for
its
crime
,
and
command
in
the
day
a
solemn
yard
plant
with
dry
-
up
shrub
like
antediluvian
specimen
of
black
tea
---
be
a
prey
to
horror
of
many
kind
.
 
<EOS>
not
last
nor
least
among
them
,
possibly
,
be
a
horror
of
what
may
befall
her
little
income
in
the
event
,
as
she
express
it
,
"
of
anything
happen
"
to
Sir

<EOS>
anything
,
in
this
sense

mean
one
thing
only
;
and
that
the
last
thing
that
can
happen
to
the
consciousness
of
any
baronet
in
the
known
world
.
   
<EOS>
an
effect
of
these
horror
be
that
Volumnia
find
she
can
not
go
to
bed
in
her
own
room
or
sit
by
the
fire
in
her
own
room
,
but
must
come
forth
with
her
fair
head
tie
up
in
a
profusion
of
shawl
,
and
her
fair
form
enrobe
in
drapery
,
and
parade
the
mansion
like
a
ghost
,
particularly
haunt
the
room
,
warm
and
luxurious
,
prepare
for
one
who
still
do
not

<EOS>
Solitude
under
such
circumstance
be
not

Volumnia

by
her
maid

who
,
impress
from
her
own

for
that
purpose

extremely
cold

very

and
generally

<EOS>
the
periodical
visit
of
the
trooper
to
these

however
,
in
the
course
of
his
patrolling
be
an
assurance
of
protection
and
company
both
to
mistress

which
render
them
very
acceptable
in
the
small
hour
of
the
night

<EOS>
whenever
he
be
hear
advance
,
they
both
make
some
little
decorative
preparation
to
receive
him
;
at
other
time
they
divide
their
watch
into
short
scrap
of
oblivion
and
dialogue
not
wholly
free
from
acerbity
,
as
to
whether
Miss
Dedlock

sit
with
her
foot
upon
the
fender
,
be

not

into
the

<EOS>
but
Volumnia
answer
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
no
!
 
<EOS>
She
may
be
ask
for
<EOS>
,
she
may
be
want
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
should
forgive
herself
"
if
anything
be
to
happen
"
and
she
be
not
on
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
She
decline
to
enter
on
the
question
,
moot
by
the
maid
,
how
the
spot
come
to
be
there
,
and
not
in
her
room
(
which
be
near
to
Sir
Leicester
's
)
,
but
staunchly
declare
that
on
the
spot
she
will
remain
.
 
<EOS>
Volumnia
further
make
a
merit
of
not
have
"
close
an
eye
"
---
as
if
she
have
twenty
or
thirty
---
though
it
be
hard
to
reconcile
this
statement
with
her
have
most
indisputably
open
two
within
five
minute
.
   
<EOS>
but
when
it
come
to
four
o'clock
,
and
still
the
same
blank
,
Volumnia
's
constancy
begin
to
fail
her
,
or
rather
it
begin
to
strengthen
,
for
she
now
consider
that
it
be
her
duty
to
be
ready
for
the
morrow
,
when
much
may
be
expect
of
her
,
that
,
in
fact
,
howsoever
anxious
to
remain
upon
the
spot
,
it
may
be
require
of
her
,
as
an
act
of
self
-
devotion
,
to
desert
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
so
when
the
trooper
reappear
with
his
,
"
have
not
you
better
go
to
bed
,
miss
?
"
<EOS>
and
when
the
maid
protest
,
more
sharply
than
before
,
"
You
have
a
deal
better
go
to
bed
,
Miss
Dedlock
!
"
<EOS>
she
meekly
rise
and
say
,
"
do
with
me
what
you
think
best
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
George
undoubtedly
think
it
good
to
escort
her
on
his
arm
to
the
door
of
her
cousinly
chamber
,
and
the
maid
as
undoubtedly
think
it
good
to
hustle
her
into
bed
with
mighty
little
ceremony
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
these
step
be
take
;
and
now
the
trooper
,
in
his
round
,
have
the
house
to
himself
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
no
improvement
in
the
weather
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
portico
,
from
the
eave
,
from
the
parapet
,
from
every
ledge
and
post
and
pillar
,
drip
the
thawed
snow
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
creep
,
as
if
for
shelter
,
into
the
lintel
of
the
great
door
---
under
it
,
into
the
corner
of
the
window
,
into
every
chink
and
crevice
of
retreat
,
and
there
waste
and
die
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
fall
still
;
upon
the
roof
,
upon
the
skylight
,
even
through
the
skylight
,
and
drip
,
drip
,
drip
,
with
the
regularity
of
the
Ghost
's
walk
,
on
the
stone
floor
below

<EOS>
the
trooper
,
his
old
recollection
awaken
by
the
solitary
grandeur
of
a
great
house
---
no
novelty
to
him
once
at
Chesney
Wold
---
 
go
up
the
stair
and
through
the
chief
room
,
hold
up
his
light
at
arm
's
length
.
 
<EOS>
think
of
his
varied
fortune
within
the
last
few
week
,
and
of
his
rustic
boyhood
,
and
of
the
two
period
of
his
life
so
strangely
bring
together
across
the
wide
intermediate
space
;
thinking
of
the
murder
man
whose
image
be
fresh
in
his
mind
;
thinking
of
the
lady
who
have
disappear
from
these
very
room
and
the
token
of
whose
recent
presence
be
all
here
;
think
of
the
master
of
the
house
upstairs
and
of
the
forebode
,
"
who
will
tell
him
!
"
<EOS>
he
look
here
and
look
there
,
and
reflect
how
he
may
see
something
now
,
which
it
would
tax
his
boldness
to
walk
up
to
,
lay
his
hand
upon
,
and
prove
to
be
a
fancy
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
all
blank
,
blank
as
the
darkness
above
and
below
,
while
he
go
up
the
great
staircase
again
,
blank
as
the
oppressive
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
all
be
still
in
readiness
,
George
Rouncewell

"
   
<EOS>
"
quite
orderly

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no

the

shake
his
head

<EOS>
"
no
letter
that
can
possibly
have
be
overlook

"
   
<EOS>
but
he
know
there
be
no
such
hope
as
that
and
lay
his
head
down
without
look
for
an
answer
.
   
<EOS>
very
familiar
to
him
,
as
he
say
himself
some
hour
ago
,
George
Rouncewell
lift
him
into
easy
position
through
the
long
remainder
of
the
blank
wintry
night
,
and
equally
familiar
with
his
unexpresse
wish
,
extinguish
the
light
and
undraw
the
curtain
at
the
first
late
break
of
day

<EOS>
the

come
like
a

<EOS>
cold

colourless

and
vague

it
send
a

it
of
a
deathlike

Esther
's
Narrative
 
<EOS>
It
be
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
when
the
house
outside
London
do
at
last
begin
to
exclude
the
country
and
to
close
us
in
with
street
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
make
our
way
along
road
in
a
far
bad
condition
than
when
we
have
traverse
them
by
daylight
,
both
the
fall
and
the
thaw
have
last
ever
since
;
but
the
energy
of
my
companion
never
slacken
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
only
be
,
as
I
think
,
of
less
assistance
than
the
horse
in
get
us
on
,
and
it
have
often
aid
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
stop
exhausted
halfway
up
hill
,
they
have
be
drive
through
stream
of
turbulent
water
,
they
have
slip
down
and
become
entangle
with
the
harness
;
but
he
and
his
little
lantern
have
be
always
ready
,
and
when
the
mishap
be
set
right
,
I
have
never
hear
any
variation
in
his
cool
,
"
get
on
,
my
lad
!
"
   
<EOS>
the
steadiness
and
confidence
with
which
he
have
direct
our
journey
back
<EOS>
I
could
not
account
for
.
 
<EOS>
never
wavering
,
he
never
even
stop
to
make
an
inquiry
until
we
be
within
a
few
mile
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
a
very
few
word
,
here
and
there
,
be
then
enough
for
him
;
and
thus
we
come
,
at
between
three
and
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
into
Islington
.
   
<EOS>
I
will
not
dwell
on
the
suspense
and
anxiety
with
which
I
reflect
all
this
time
that
we
be
leave
my
mother
farther
and
farther
behind
every
minute
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
some
strong
hope
that
he
must
be
right
and
could
not
fail
to
have
a
satisfactory
object
in
follow
this
woman
,
but
I
torment
myself
with
question
it
and
discuss
it
during
the
whole
journey
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
to
ensue
when
we
find
her
and
what
could
compensate
us
for
this
loss
of
time
be
question
also
that
I
could
not
possibly
dismiss
;
my
mind
be
quite
torture
by
long
dwell
on
such
reflection
when
we
stop
.
   
<EOS>
We
stop
in
a
high
-
street
where
there
be
a
coach
-
stand
.
 
<EOS>
My
companion
pay
our
two
driver
,
who
be
as
completely
cover
with
splash
as
if
they
have
be
drag
along
the
road
like
the
carriage
itself
,
and
give
them
some
brief
direction
where
to
take
it
,
lift
me
out
of
it
and
into
a
hackney
-
coach
he
have
choose
from
the
rest
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
my
dear
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
as
he
do
this
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
wet
you
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
have
not
be
conscious
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
melted
snow
have
find
its
way
into
the
carriage
,
and
I
have
get
out
two
or
three
time
when
a
fall
horse
be
plunge
and
have
to
be
get
up
,
and
the
wet
have
penetrate
my
dress
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
him
<EOS>
it
be
no
matter
,
but
the
driver
,
who
know
him
,
would
not
be
dissuade
by
me
from
run
down
the
street
to
his
stable
,
whence
he
bring
an
armful
of
clean
dry
straw
.
 
<EOS>
They
shake
it
out
and
strew
it
well
about
me
,
and
I
find
it
warm
and
comfortable
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Mr
Bucket
,
with
his
head
in
at
the
window
after
I
be
shut
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
be
a
-
go
to
mark
this
person
down
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
take
a
little
time
,
but
you
do
not
mind
that
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
pretty
sure
that
I
have
get
a
motive
.
 
<EOS>
be
not
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
little
think
what
it
be
,
little
thought
in
how
short
a
time
I
should
understand
it
better
,
but
I
assure
him
that
I
have
confidence
in
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
you
may
have
,
my
dear
,
"
he
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
I
tell
you
what
!
 
<EOS>
if
you
only
repose
half
as
much
confidence
in
me
as
I
repose
in
you
after
what
I
have
experience
of
you
,
that
will
do
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
!
 
<EOS>
You
be
no
trouble
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
a
young
woman
in
any
station
of
society
---
and
I
have
see
many
elevate
one
too
<EOS>
---
conduct
herself
like
<EOS>
you
have
conduct
yourself
since
you
be
call
out
of
your
bed
.
<EOS>
You
be
a
pattern
,
you
know
,
that
be
what
you
be
,
"
say
Mr
Bucket
warmly
;
"
you
be
a
pattern
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
be
very
glad
,
as
indeed
I
be
,
to
have
be
no
hindrance
to
him
,
and
that
I
hope
I
should
be
none
now
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
he
return
,
"
when
a
young
lady
be
as
mild
as
she
be
game
,
and
as
game
as
she
be
mild
,
that
be
all
I
ask
,
and
more
than
I
expect
.
 
<EOS>
She
then
become
a
queen
,
and
that
be
about
what
you
be
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
with
these
encouraging
word
---
they
really
be
encouraging
to
me
under
those
lonely
and
anxious
circumstance
---
he
get
upon
the
box
,
and
we
once
more
drive
away
.
 
<EOS>
where
we
drive
I
neither
know
then
nor
have
ever
know
since
,
but
we
appear
to
seek
out
the
narrow
and
bad
street
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
whenever
I
see
him
direct
the
driver
,
I
be
prepared
for
our
descending
into
a
deep
complication
of
such
street
,
and
we
never
fail
to
do
so
.
   
<EOS>
sometimes
we
emerge
upon
a
wide
thoroughfare
or
come
to
a
large
building
than
the
generality
,
well
light
.
 
<EOS>
then
we
stop
at
office
like
those
we
have
visit
when
we
begin
our
journey
,
and
I
see
him
in
consultation
with
other
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
he
would
get
down
by
an
archway
or
at
a
street
corner
and
mysteriously
show
the
light
of
his
little
lantern
.
 
<EOS>
this
would
attract
similar
light
from
various
dark
quarter
,
like
so
many
insect
,
and
a
fresh
consultation
would
be
hold
.
 
<EOS>
by
degree
we
appear
to
contract
our
search
within
narrow
and
easy
limit
.
 
<EOS>
single
police
-
officer
on
duty
could
now
tell
Mr
Bucket
what
he
want
to
know
and
point
to
him
where
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
we
stop
for
a
rather
long
conversation
between
him
and
one
of
these
man
,
which
I
suppose
to
be
satisfactory
from
his
manner
of
nod
from
time
to
time
.
 
<EOS>
when
it
be
finish
he
come
to
me
look
very
busy
and
very
attentive
.
   
<EOS>
"
now
,
Miss
Summerson
,
he
say
to
me
,
"
you
will
not
be
alarm
<EOS>
whatever
come
off
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
necessary
for
me
to
give
you
any
further
caution
than
to
tell
you
that
we
have
mark
this
person
down
and
that
you
may
be
of
use
to
me
before
I
know
it
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
to
ask
such
a
thing
,
my
dear
,
but
would
you
walk
a
little
way
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
of
course
I
get
out
directly
and
take
his
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
so
easy
to
keep
your
foot
,
"
say
Mr
Bucket
,
"
but
take
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
although
I
look
about
me
confusedly
and
hurriedly
as
we
cross
the
street
,
I
think
I
know
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
we
in
Holborn
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Mr
Bucket
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
this
turning
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
look
like
Chancery
Lane
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
and
be
christen
so
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Mr
Bucket
.
   
<EOS>
We
turn
down
it
,
and
as
we
go
shuffle
through
the
sleet
,
I
hear
the
clock
strike
half
-
past
five
.
 
<EOS>
We
pass
on
in
silence
and
as
quickly
as
we
could
with
such
a
foothold
,
when
some
one
come
towards
us
on
the
narrow
pavement
,
wrap
in
a
cloak
,
stop
and
stand
aside
to
give
me
room
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
same
moment
I
hear
an
exclamation
of
wonder
and
my
own
name
from
Mr
Woodcourt
.
<EOS>
I
know
his
voice
very
well
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
so
unexpected
and
<EOS>
so
---
I
do
not
know
what
to
call
it
,
whether
pleasant
or
painful
---
to
come
upon
it
after
my
feverish
wander
journey
,
and
in
the
midst
of
the
night
,
that
I
could
not
keep
back
the
tear
from
my
eye
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
like
hear
his
voice
in
a
strange
country
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Miss
Summerson
,
that
you
should
be
out
at
this
hour
,
and
in
such
weather
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
have
hear
from
my
guardian
of
my
have
be
call
away
on
some
uncommon
business
and
say
so
to
dispense
with
any
explanation
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
that
we
have
but
just
leave
a
coach
and
be
go
---
<EOS>
but
then
I
be
oblige
to
look
at
my
companion
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
see
,
Mr
Woodcourt
"
---
he
have
catch
the
name
from
me
---
"
we
be
a
-
go
at
present
into
the
next
street
.
 
<EOS>
Inspector
Bucket
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Woodcourt
,
disregard
my
remonstrance
,
have
hurriedly
take
off
his
cloak
and
be
put
it
about
me
.
 
<EOS>

They
be
all
occupy
with
the
poor
girl

I
hear
Mr
Woodcourt
direct
them
and
speak
to
her
often

<EOS>
at
length
he
come
in
with
Mr
Bucket
and
say
that
as
it
be
important
to
address
her
gently
,
he
think
it
best
that
I
should
ask
her
for
whatever
information
we
desire
to
obtain
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
that
she
could
now
reply
to
question
if
she
be
soothe
and
not
alarm

<EOS>
the
question
,
Mr
Bucket
say
,
be
how
she
come
by
the
letter
,
what
pass
between
her
and
the
person
who
give
her
the
letter

where
the
person
go

<EOS>
hold
my

as
steadily
as
I
could
to
these
point

I
go
into

next
room
with

<EOS>
Mr

would
have
remain
outside

at
my
solicitation
go
in
with
us

<EOS>
the
poor

be
sit
on
the
floor
where
they
have
lay
her
down

<EOS>
They
stand
around
her
,
though
at
a
little
distance
,
that
she
may
have
air

<EOS>
She
be
not
pretty
and
look
weak
and
poor

but
she
have
a
plaintive
and
a
good
face

though
it
be
still
a

wild

<EOS>
I
kneel
on
the
ground
beside

put
her
poor
head
upon

whereupon
she
draw
her

burst
into

with
a
good
deal
of
contrition

before

<EOS>
oh

that
if
you
have

you

so
I
tell

but
she

<EOS>
as
I
watch
her
face

soothe

to
go
on

I
see
that
Mr

receive
this
with
a
look

I
could
not

from
one
of
alarm

<EOS>
"

cry
the

press
her
hair

<EOS>
She

"
You

"
   
<EOS>
"
yes

<EOS>
but
do
not

that
be
a

because
I
have
be
so

<EOS>
angry

<EOS>
"
there
!
 
<EOS>
now
I

<EOS>
so
she
say
,
could
I
tell
her
how
to
find
it
,
and
I
say
yes
,
<EOS>
and
I
tell
her
;
and
she
look
at
me
with
eye
like
almost
as
if
she
be
blind
,
and
herself
all
wave
back
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
she
take
out
the
letter

show
it
me
,
and
say
if
she
be
to
put
that
in
the
post

office
,
it
would
be
rub
out
and
not
minded
and
never
send

and
would
I
take
it
from
her
,
and
send
it
,
and
the
messenger
would
be
pay
at
the
house

<EOS>
and
so
I
say
yes

if
it
be
no
harm

<EOS>
she

no

no
harm

<EOS>
and
so
I
take
it
from
her
,
and
<EOS>
she
say
she
have
nothing
to
give
me
,
and
I
say
I
be
poor
myself

consequently
want
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
she
say
God
bless
you

go

do
she
go

"
   
<EOS>
"
yes

cry
the
girl
,
anticipate
the
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
!
 
<EOS>
She
go
the
way
I
have
show
her
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
come
in
,
and
Mrs
Snagsby
come
behind
me
from
somewhere
and
lay
hold
of
me
,
and
I
be
frightened
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Woodcourt
take
her
kindly
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bucket
wrap
me
up
,
and
immediately
we
be
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Woodcourt
hesitate
,
but
I
say
,
"
do
not
leave
me
now
!
"
<EOS>
and
Mr
Bucket
add
,
"
You
will
be
well
with
us
<EOS>
,
we
may
want
you
;
do
not
lose
time
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
have
the
most
confused
impression
of
that
walk
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
that
it
be
neither
night
nor
day
,
that
morning
be
dawn
but
the
street
-
lamp
be
not
yet
put
out
,
that
the
sleet
be
still
fall
and
that
all
the
way
be
deep
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
a
few
chill
people
pass
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
the
wet
house
-
top
,
the
clogged
and
burst
gutter
and
water
-
spout
,
the
mound
of
blacken
ice
and
snow
over
which
we
pass
,
the
narrowness
of
the
court
by
which
we
go
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
I
remember
that
the
poor
girl
seem
to
be
yet
tell
her
story
audibly
and
plainly
in
my
hearing
,
that
I
could
feel
her
rest
on
my
arm
,
that
the
stained
house
-
front
put
on
human
shape
and
look
at
me
,
that
great
water
-
gate
seem
to
be
open
and
close
in
my
head
or
in
the
air
,
and
that
the
unreal
thing
be
more
substantial
than
the
real
.
   
<EOS>
at
last
we
stand
under
a
dark
and
miserable
covered
way
,
where
one
lamp
be
burn
over
an
iron
gate
and
where
the
morning
faintly
struggle
in
.
 
<EOS>
the
gate
be
close
.
 
<EOS>
beyond
it
be
a
burial
ground
 
---
a
dreadful
spot
in
which
the
night
be
very
slowly
stirring
,
but
where
I
could
dimly
see
heap
of
dishonoured
grave
and
stone
,
hem
in
by
filthy
house
with
a
few
dull
light
in
their
window
and
on
whose
wall
a
thick
humidity
break
out
like
a
disease
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
step
at
the
gate
,
drench
in
the
fearful
wet
of
such
a
place
,
which
ooze
and
splash
down
everywhere
,
I
see
,
with
a
cry
of
pity
and
horror
,
a
woman
lie
---
<EOS>
Jenny
,
the
mother
of
the
dead
child
.
   
<EOS>
I
run
forward
,
but
they
stop
me
,
and
Mr
Woodcourt
entreat
me
with
the
great
earnestness
,
even
with
tear
,
before
I
go
up
to
the
figure
to
listen
for
an
instant
to
what
Mr
Bucket
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
so
,
as
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
so
,
as
I
be
sure
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Summerson
,
you
will
understand
me
,
if
you
think
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
They
change
clothe
at
the
cottage
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
change
clothe
at
the
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
repeat
the
word
in
my
mind
,
and
I
know
what
they
mean
of
themselves
,
but
I
attach
no
meaning
to
them
in
any
other
connexion
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
one
return
,
"
say
Mr
Bucket
,
"
and
one
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
one
that
go
on
only
go
on
a
certain
way
agree
upon
to
deceive
and
then
turn
across
country
and
go
home
.
 
<EOS>
think
a
moment
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
repeat
this
in
my
mind
too
,
but
I
have
not
the
least
idea
what
it
mean
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
before
me
,
lie
on
the
step
,
the
mother
of
the
dead
child
.
 
<EOS>
She
lie
there
with
one
arm
creep
round
a
bar
of

it

who
have
so
lately
speak
to
my
mother

<EOS>
She
lie
there

a
distressed
,
unsheltered
,
senseless
creature
.
 
<EOS>
She
who
have
bring
my
mother
's
letter
,
who
could
give
me
the
only
clue
to
where
my
mother
be

who
be
to
guide
us
to
rescue

save
her

we
have
seek
so
far

who
have
come
to
this

some

with
my

I

she

<EOS>
I
see
but
do
not
comprehend
the
solemn
and
compassionate
look
in
Mr
Woodcourt
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
but
do
not
comprehend
his
touch
the
other
on
the
breast
to
keep
him
back
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
stand
uncovered
in
the
bitter
air
,
with
a
reverence
for
something
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
understanding
for
all
this
be
go

<EOS>
I
even
hear
it
say
between
them
,
"
Shall
she
go

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
have
better
go

<EOS>
Her

should
be
the
first

touch
her

<EOS>
They
have
a
high
right

ours

<EOS>
I
pass
on
to
the
gate
and
stoop
down
.
 
<EOS>
I
lift
the
heavy
head
,
put
the
long
dank
hair
aside

and
turn
the
face

and
it
be
my

cold
and
dead

perspective
 
<EOS>
I
proceed
to
other
passage
of
my
narrative
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
goodness
of
all
about
me
I
derive
such
consolation
as
I
can
never
think
of
unmoved
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
already
say
so
much
of
myself
,
and
so
much
still
remain
,
that
I
will
not
dwell
upon
my
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
an
illness
,
but
it
be
not
a
long
one
;
and
I
would
avoid
even
this
mention
of
it
if
I
could
quite
keep
down
the
recollection
of
their
sympathy
.
   
<EOS>
I
proceed
to
other
passage
of
my
narrative
.
   
<EOS>
during
the
time
of
my
illness
,
we
be
still
in
London
,
where
Mrs
Woodcourt
have
come
,
on
my
guardian
's
invitation
,
to
stay
with
us
.
<EOS>
when
my
guardian
think
me
well
and
cheerful
enough
to
talk
with
him
in
our
old
way
---
though
I
could
have
do
that
sooner
if
he
would
have
believe
me
<EOS>
---
I
resume
my
work
and
my
chair
beside
his
.
<EOS>
He
have
appoint
the
time
himself
,
and
we
be
alone

I
have
a
scheme

<EOS>

<EOS>
I
propose
to
remain
here
,
perhaps
for
six
month
,
perhaps
for
a
long
time

as
it
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
quite
to
settle
here
for
a
while
,
in
short

<EOS>

and
in
the
meanwhile
leave

Bleak

<EOS>
I
think
his
tone
sound
sorrowful
,
but
look
at
him
,
I
see
his
kind
face
light
up
by
its
pleasantest
smile

you

I

of
estrangement

<EOS>
My
dear
girl
have
be
to
see
us
lately
every
day
,
some
time
twice
in
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
have
foresee
,
all
along
,
that
this
would
only
last
until
I
be
quite
myself
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
full
well
that
her
fervent
heart
be
as
full
of
affection
and
gratitude
towards
her
cousin
John
as
it
have
ever
be
,
and
we
acquit
Richard
of
lay
any
injunction
upon
her
to
stay
away
;
but
we
know
on
the
other
hand
that
she
feel
it
a
part
of
her
duty
to
him
to
be
spare
of
her
visit
at
our
house
.
 
<EOS>
My
guardian
's
delicacy
have
soon
perceive
this
and
have
try
to
convey
to
her
that
he
think
she
be
right

<EOS>
"
dear

unfortunate

mistaken
Richard

I.

He

"
the
more

His
gentleness

consideration
for
Richard
<EOS>
whenever
we
speak
of

touch
me
so
that
I
be
always
silent
on

very
soon

<EOS>
"
I
suppose

Lord

check
himself
in

<EOS>
in

to
this

oddly
abrupt

I
like
her
very

can
I

no

I
have
nothing

<EOS>
at

I
have
nothing
in

<EOS>
I
have
an
undefined
impression
that
it
may
have
be
well
if
we
have
have
some
other
inmate

I
could
hardly
have
explain

You
say

some

I.
   
<EOS>
"
why
---
yes
---
perhaps
,
"
return
my
guardian

begin
his
answer
in
a
very
deliberate
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
about
half
a
year
hence
or
so
,
there
be
a
medical
attendant
for
the
poor

be
appoint
at
a
certain
place
in
Yorkshire

<EOS>
It
be
a
thriving
place

pleasantly
situate

stream
and
street

town

country
,
mill

moor

and
seem
to
present
an
opening
for
such
a
man

I
mean
a
man
whose
hope
and
aim
may
sometimes
lie
(
as
most
man
's
sometimes
do
,
I
dare
say
)
above
the
ordinary
level

to
whom
the
ordinary
level
will
be
high
enough
after
all
if
it
should
prove
to

a
way
of
usefulness

good
service
lead
to
no

all
generous

I
can

in
my
mourning
dress
,
and
that
account
for
it
<EOS>
,
I
consider
.
   
<EOS>
I
now
begin
to
visit
my
dear
girl
every
day
in
the
dull
dark
corner
where
she
live
.
 
<EOS>
the
morning
be
my
usual
time
,
but
whenever
I
find
I
have
an
hour
or
so
to
spare
,
I
put
on
my
bonnet
and
bustle
off
to
Chancery
Lane
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
both
so
glad
to
see
me
at
all
hour
,
and
use
to
brighten
up
so
when
they
hear
me
open
the
door
and
come
in
(
be
quite
at
home
,
I
never
knock
)
,
that
I
have
no
fear
of
become
troublesome
just
yet
.
   
<EOS>
on
these
occasion
I
frequently
find
Richard
absent
.
 
<EOS>
at
other
time
he
would
be
write
or
read
paper
in
the
cause
at
that
table
of
his
,
so
cover
with
paper
,
which
be
never
disturb
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
would
come
upon
him
linger
at
the
door
of
Mr
Vholes
's
office
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
I
would
meet
him
in
the
neighbourhood
lounge
about
and
bite
his
nail
.
 
<EOS>
I
often
meet
him
wander
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
near
the
place
where
I
have
first
see
him
,
<EOS>
oh
how
different
,
how
different
!
   
<EOS>
that
the
money
Ada
bring
him
be
melt
away
with
the
candle
I
use
to
see
burn
after
dark
in
Mr
Vholes
's
office
<EOS>
I
know
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
large
amount
in
the
beginning
,
he
have
marry
in
debt
,
and
I
could
not
fail
to
understand
,
by
this
time
,
what
be
mean
by
Mr
Vholes
's
shoulder
be
at
the
wheel
---
as
I
still
hear
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
make
the
good
of
housekeeper
and
try
hard
to
save
,
but
I
know
that
they
be
get
poor
and
poor
every
day
.
   
<EOS>
She
shine
in
the
miserable
corner
like
a
beautiful
star
.
 
<EOS>
She
adorn
and
grace
it
so
that
it
become
another
place
.
 
<EOS>
Paler
than
she
have
be
at
home
,
and
a
little
quieter
than
I
have
think
natural
when
she
be
yet
so
cheerful
and
hopeful
<EOS>
,
her
face
be
so
unshadowed
that
I
half
believe
she
be
blind
by
her
love
for
Richard
to
his
ruinous
career
.
   
<EOS>
I
go
one
day
to
dine
with
them
while
I
be
under
this
impression
.
<EOS>
as
I
turn
into
Symond
's
Inn
,
I
meet
little
Miss
Flite
come
out
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
to
make
a
stately
call
upon
the
ward
in
Jarndyce
,
as
she
still
call
them
,
and
have
derive
the
high
gratification
from
that
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
Ada
have
already
tell
me
that
she
call
every
Monday
at
five
o'clock
,
with
one
little
extra
white
bow
in
her
bonnet
,
which
never
appear
there
at
any
other
time
,
and
with
her
large
reticule
of
document
on
her
arm
.

it
may
be
,
that
I
consider
Mr
C
's
affair
in
a
very
bad
way
,
that
I
consider
Mr
C
himself
in
a
very
bad
way
,
and
that
I
regard
this
as
an
exceedingly
ill
-
advise
marriage

I
here

sir

<EOS>
yes

I
thank
you
;
I
be
here
,
Mr

,
and
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
some
agreeable
conversation
with
Miss
Summerson

for
which
I
have
to
thank
you
very
much
,

<EOS>
He
break
off
thus
in
answer
to
Richard
,
who
address
him
as
he
come
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
I
too
well
understand
Mr
Vholes
's
scrupulous
way
of
save
himself
and
his
respectability
not
to
feel
that
our
bad
fear
do
but
keep
pace
with
his
client
's
progress
.
   
<EOS>
We
sit
down
to
dinner
,
and
I
have
an
opportunity
of
observe
Richard
,
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
disturb
by
Mr
Vholes
(
who
take
off
his
glove
to
dine
)
,
though
he
sit
opposite
to
me
at
the
small
table
,
for
I
doubt
if
,
look
up
at
all
,
he
once
remove
his
eye
from
his
host
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
Richard
thin
and
languid
,
slovenly
in
his
dress
,
abstract
in
his
manner
,
force
his
spirit
now
and
then
,
and
at
other
interval
relapse
into
a
dull
thoughtfulness
.
<EOS>
about
his
large
bright
eye
that
use
to
be
so
merry
there
be
a
wanness
and
a
restlessness
that
change
them
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
1
can
not
use
the
expression
that
he
look
old
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
ruin
of
youth
which
be
not
like
age
,
and
into
such
a
ruin
Richard
's
youth
and
youthful
beauty
have
all
fall
away
.
   
<EOS>
He
eat
little
and
seem
indifferent
what
it
be
,
show
himself
to
be
much
more
impatient
than
he
use
to
be
,
and
be
quick
even
with
Ada
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
at
first
that
his
old
light
-
hearted
manner
be
all
go
,
but
it
shine
out
of
him
sometimes
as
I
have
occasionally
know
little
momentary
glimpse
of
my
own
old
face
to
look
out
upon
me
from
the
glass
.
 
<EOS>
His
laugh
have
not
quite
leave
him
either
,
but
it
be
like
the
echo
of
a
joyful
sound
,
and
that
be
always
sorrowful
.
   
<EOS>
yet
he
be
as
glad
as
ever
,
in
his
old
affectionate
way
,
to
have
me
there
,
and
we
talk
of
the
old
time
pleasantly
.
 
<EOS>
these
do
not
appear
to
be
interesting
to
Mr
Vholes
,
though
he
occasionally
make
a
gasp
which
I
believe
be
his
smile
.
 
<EOS>
He
rise
shortly
after
dinner
and
say
that
with
the
permission
of
the
lady
he
would
retire
to
his
office
.
   
<EOS>

"
the
interest

<EOS>
They
be
paramount
in
the
thought
of
a
professional
man
like
myself
,
who
wish
to
preserve
a
good

among
his
fellow

practitioner
and
society
at

My
deny
myself

conversation
may
not

wholly
irrespective

"
   
Richard
express
himself
quite
sure
of
that
and
light
Mr
Vholes
out
.
 
<EOS>
on
his
return
he
tell
us
,
more
than
once
,
that
Vholes
be
a
good
fellow
,
a
safe
fellow
,
a
man
who
do
what
he
pretend
to
do
,
a
very
good
fellow
indeed

He
be
so
defiant
about
it
that
it
strike
me

have
begin
to
doubt
Mr
Vholes
.
   
<EOS>
then
he
throw
himself
on
the
sofa
,
tired
out
;
and
Ada
and
I
put
thing
to
right
,
for
they
have
no
other
servant
than
the
woman
who
attend
to
the
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
girl
have
a
cottage
piano
there
and
quietly
sit
down
to
sing
some
of
Richard
's
favourite
,
the
lamp
be
first
remove
into
the
next
room
,
as
he
complain
of
its
hurt
his
eye
.
   
<EOS>
I
sit
between
them
,
at
my
dear
girl
's
side
,
and
feel
very
melancholy
listening
to
her
sweet
voice
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
Richard
do
too
;
I
think
he
darken
the
room
for
that
reason
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
singe
some
time
,
rise
between
while
to
bend
over
him
and
speak
to
him
,
when
Mr
Woodcourt
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
sit
down
by
Richard
and
half
playfully
,
half
earnestly
,
quite
naturally
and
easily
,
find
out
how
he
feel
and
where
he
have
be
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
presently
he
propose
to
accompany
him
in
a
short
walk
on
one
of
the
bridge
,
as
it
be
a
moonlight
airy
night
;
and
Richard
readily
consent
,
they
go
out
together
.
   
<EOS>
They
leave
my
dear
girl
still
sit
at
the
piano
and
me
still
sit
beside
her
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
be
go
out
,
I
draw
my
arm
round
her
waist
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
her
left
hand
in
mine

(
I
be
sit
on
that
side
)
,
but
keep
her
right
upon
the
key

go
over
and
over
them
without
strike
any
note

you
for
that

<EOS>
I
point
out
to
my
darling
how
this
could
scarcely
be
,
because
Mr
Woodcourt
have
come
to
her
cousin
John
's
house
and
have
know
us
all
there
,

because
he
have
always

forth

<EOS>
I
think
it
best
to
let
my
dear
girl
have
her
way
and
to
say
no
more
about
it

<EOS>
so
I
say
as
much

I
say
it
lightly

I
feel
her
trembling

I

I
notice

I
know
that

Chapter

<EOS>
a
Discovery
 
<EOS>
the
day
when
I
frequent
that
miserable
corner
which
my
dear
girl
brighten
can
never
fade
in
my
remembrance
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
it
,
and
I
never
wish
to
see
it
now
;
I
have
be
there
only
once
since
,
but
in
my
memory
there
be
a
mournful
glory
shine
on
the
place
which
will
shine
for
ever
.
   
<EOS>
not
a
day
pass
without
my
go
there
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
I
find
Mr
Skimpole
there
,
on
two
or
three
occasion
,
idly
play
the
piano
and
talk
in
his
usual
vivacious
strain
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
besides
my
very
much
mistrust
the
probability
of
his
be
there
without
make
Richard
poorer
,
I
feel
as
if
there
be
something
in
his
careless
gaiety
too
inconsistent
with
what
I
know
of
the
depth
of
Ada
's
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
clearly
perceive
,
too
,
that
Ada
share
my
feeling
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
resolve
,
after
much
thinking
of
it
,
to
make
a
private
visit
to
Mr
Skimpole
and
try
delicately
to
explain
myself
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
girl
be
the
great
consideration
that
make
me
bold
.
   
<EOS>
I
set
off
one
morning
,
accompany
by
Charley
,
for
Somers
Town
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
approach
the
house
,
I
be
strongly
inclined
to
turn
back
,
for
I
feel
what
a
desperate
attempt
it
be
to
make
an
impression
on
Mr
Skimpole
and
how
extremely
likely
it
be
that
he
would
signally
defeat
me
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
think
that
be
there
,
I
would
go
through
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
knock
with
a
tremble
hand
at
Mr
Skimpole
's
door
---
 
literally
with
a
hand
,
for
the
knocker
be
go
---
and
after
a
long
parley
gain
admission
from
an
Irishwoman
,
who
be
in
the
area
when
I
knock
,
break
up
the
lid
of
a
water
-
butt
with
a
poker
to
light
the
fire
with
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Skimpole
,
lie
on
the
sofa
in
his
room
,
play
the
flute
a
little
,
be
enchant
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
who
should
receive
me
,
he
ask
.
 
<EOS>
who
would
I
prefer
for
mistress
of
the
ceremony
?
 
<EOS>
Would
I
have
his
Comedy
daughter
,
his
Beauty
daughter
,
or
his
Sentiment
daughter
?
 
<EOS>
or
would
I
have
all
the
daughter
at
once
in
a
perfect
nosegay
?
   
<EOS>
I
reply
,
half
defeat
already
,
that
I
wish
to
speak
to
himself
only
if
he
would
give
me
leave
.

say

certainly
be
not
business

I
come
upon

it
be
not
quite

then
,
my

Miss
Summerson
,

say
he
with
the
frank
gaiety

do
not

should
you
allude
to
anything
that
be
not
a
pleasant

never
do

that

dispose
of
,

talk

something
else

"
   
<EOS>
although
I
be
embarrassed
,
I
take
courage
to
intimate
that
I
still
wish
to
pursue
the
subject

<EOS>
"
I
should
think
it
a
mistake
,

say
Mr
Skimpole
with
his
airy
laugh
,
"

I

Miss
Summerson
capable

make
one

not

<EOS>
"
Mr
Skimpole

I

raise
my
eye
to
his
,
"
I
have
so
often
hear
you

Mr

brightly

<EOS>
"
not
an

<EOS>

that
perhaps
,
"
I
go
on
,
"
you
will
excuse
my
boldness
on
that
account

<EOS>
I
think
you
ought
most
seriously
to
know
that
Richard

he
be

<EOS>
"
dear

Mr

so

I

me

in

embarrassed

Mr
Skimpole
with
a
delighted
countenance

<EOS>
"
this
at

naturally
cause
Ada
much
secret
anxiety
,

as
I
think
she
be
less
anxious
when
no
claim
be
make
upon
her
by
visitor

and
<EOS>
as
Richard
have
one
uneasiness
always
heavy
on
his
mind
,
it
have
occur
to
me
to
take
the
liberty
of
say
that

if
you
would

not

"
   
I
be
come
to
the
point
with
great
difficulty
when
he
take
me
by
both
hand
and
with
a
radiant
face
and
<EOS>
in
the
lively
way
anticipate
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
not
go
there
?
 
<EOS>
certainly
not
,
my
dear
Miss
Summerson
,
most
assuredly
not

<EOS>
why
SHOULD
I
go
there
?
 
<EOS>
when
I
go
anywhere
,
I
go
for
pleasure

<EOS>
I
do
not
go
anywhere
for
pain
,
because
I
be
make
for
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
Pain
come
to
me
when
it
want
me
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
I
have
have
very
little
pleasure
at
our
dear
Richard
's
lately
,
and
your
practical
sagacity
demonstrate
why
.
 
<EOS>
Our
young
friend
,
lose
the
youthful
poetry
which
be
once
so
captivate
in
them
,
begin
to
think
,
"
this
be
a
man
who
want
pound
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
I
be
;
I
always
want
pound
;
not
for
myself
,
but
because
tradespeople
always
want
them
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
next
,
our
young
friend
begin
to
think
,
become
mercenary
,
"
this
be
the
man
who
have
pound
,
who
borrow
them
,
"
which
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
borrow
pound
.
 
<EOS>
so
our
young
friend
,
reduce
to
prose
(
which
be
much
to
be
regret
)
,
degenerate
in
their
power
of
impart
pleasure
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
why
should
I
go
to
see
them
,
therefore
?
 
<EOS>
absurd
!
"
   
<EOS>
through
the
beam
smile
with
which
he
regard
me
as
he
reason
thus
,
there
now
break
forth
a
look
of
disinterested
benevolence
quite
astonishing
.
   
<EOS>
"
besides
,
"
he
say
,
pursue
his
argument
in
his
tone
of
light
-
hearted
conviction
,
"
if
I
do
not
go
anywhere
for
pain
---
which
would
be
a
perversion
of
the
intention
of
my
being
,
and
a
monstrous
thing
to
do
---
why
should
I
go
anywhere
to
be
the
cause
of
pain
?
 
<EOS>
if
I
go
to
see
our
young
friend
in
their
present
ill
-
regulate
state
of
mind
,
I
should
give
them
pain
.
 
<EOS>
the
association
with
me
would
be
disagreeable
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
say
,
"
this
be
the
man
who
have
pound
and
who
can
not
pay
pound
,
"
which
I
can
not
,
of
course
;
nothing
could
be
more
out
of
the
question

<EOS>
then
kindness
require
that
I
should

near
them

I
will
not

<EOS>
He
finish
by
genially
kiss
my
hand
and
thank
me
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
but
Miss
Summerson
's
fine
tact
,
he
say
,
would
have
find
this
out
for
him

<EOS>
I
be
much
disconcert
,

I
reflect
that
if
the
main
point
be
gain
,
it
matter
little
how
strangely
he
pervert
everything
lead
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
determine
to
mention
something
else
,
however
,

I
think
I
be
not

put
off
in
that
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Skimpole
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
must
take
the
liberty
of
say
before
I
conclude
my
visit
that
I
be
much
surprised
to
learn

on
the
good
authority
,
some
little
time
ago
,
that
you
know
with
whom
that
poor
boy
leave
Bleak
House
and
that
you
accept
a
present
on
that
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
mention
it
to
my
guardian
,
for
I
fear
it
would
hurt
him
unnecessarily
;
but
I
may
say
to
you
that
I
be
much
surprised
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
?
 
<EOS>
really
surprised
,
my
dear
Miss
Summerson
?
<EOS>
"
he
return
inquiringly
,
raise
his
pleasant
eyebrow
.
   
<EOS>
"
greatly
surprised
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
think
about
it
for
a
little
while
with
a
highly
agreeable
and
whimsical
expression
of
face
,
then
quite
give
it
up
and
say
in
his
most
engaging
manner
,
"
You
know
what
a
child
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
why
surprised
?
"
   
<EOS>
I
be
reluctant
to
enter
minutely
into
that
question
,
but
as
he
beg
I
would
,
for
he
be
really
curious
to
know
<EOS>
,
I
give
him
to
understand
in
the
gentle
word
I
could
use
that
his
conduct
seem
to
involve
a
disregard
of
several
moral
obligation
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
much
amused
and
interested
when
he
hear
this
and
say
,
"
no

really
?
"
<EOS>
with
ingenuous
simplicity
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
do
not
intend
to
be
responsible

I
never
could
do
it

a
thing

below
me

Mr
Skimpole

<EOS>
"
I
do
not
even
know
which
;

as
I
understand
the
way
in
which
my
dear
Miss
Summerson
(
always
remarkable
for
her
practical
good
sense
and
clearness
)
put
this
case
,
I
should
imagine
it
be
chiefly
a
question
of
money

you
know

I
incautiously
give
a
qualified
assent

this

then
you
see

Mr

shake
his
head

be
hopeless
of
understand
it

<EOS>
I
suggest
,
as
I
rise
to
go

that
it
be
not
right

betray
my
guardian

confidence

a
bribe

observe

here

the

this
for

Bucket
still
entreat

to
accept

be
there
reason

should
accept

<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
Skimpole
perceive
them

<EOS>
what
be
they
?
<EOS>
skimpole
reason
with
himself
<EOS>
,
this
be
a
tamed
lynx
,
an
active
police
-
officer
,
an
intelligent
man
,
a
person
of
a
peculiarly
direct
energy

great
subtlety
both
of
conception

execution

who
discover
our

run
away

recover
our

<EOS>
this
active
police
-
officer
and
intelligent
man
have
acquire

in
the
exercise
of
his
art
,
a
strong
faith
in
money
;
he
find
it
very
useful
to
him
,
and
he
make
it
very
useful
to
society

<EOS>
Shall
I
shake
that
faith
in
Bucket
because
I
want
it
myself
;
shall
I
deliberately
blunt
one
of
Bucket
's
weapon
;
shall
I
positively
paralyse
Bucket
in
his
next
detective
operation

again

if
it
be
blameable
in
Skimpole
to
take
the
note

it
be
blameable
in
Bucket
to
offer
the
note

much
more
blameable
in
Bucket
,
because
he
be
the
know
man

<EOS>
now
,
Skimpole
wish
to
think
well
of
Bucket
;
Skimpole
deem
it
essential
,
in
its
little
place
,
to
the
general
cohesion
of
thing
,
that
he
SHOULD
think
well
of
Bucket
.
 
<EOS>
the
state
expressly
ask
him
to
trust

he
do

that
be
all
he
do

<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
offer
in
reply
to
this
exposition
and
therefore
take
my
leave
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Skimpole
,
however
,
who
be
in
excellent
spirit
,
would
not
hear
of
my
return
home
attend
only
by
"
Little
coavinse
,
"
and
accompany
me
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
entertain
me
on
the
way
with
a
variety
of
delightful
conversation
and
assure
me
,
at
parting
,
that
he
should
never
forget
the
fine
tact
with
which
I
have
find
that
out
for
him
about
our
young
friend
.
   
<EOS>
as
it
so
happen
that
I
never
see
Mr
Skimpole
again
,
I
may
at
once
finish
what
I
know
of
his
history
.
 
<EOS>
a
coolness
arise
between
him
and
my
guardian
,
base
principally
on
the
forego
ground
and
on
his
have
heartlessly
disregard
my
guardian
's
entreaty
(
as
we
afterwards
learn
from
Ada
)
in
reference
to
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
His
be
heavily
in
my
guardian
's
debt
have
nothing
to
do
with
their
separation
.
 
<EOS>
He
die
some
five
year
afterwards
and
leave
a
diary
behind
him
,
with
letter
and
other
material
towards
his
life
,
which
be
publish
and
which
show
him
to
have
be
the
victim
of
a
combination
on
the
part
of
mankind
against
an
amiable
child
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
consider
very
pleasant
reading
,
but
I
never
read
more
of
it
myself
than
the
sentence
on
which
I
chance
to
light
on
open
the
book
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
this
:
"
Jarndyce
,
in
common
with
most
other
man
I
have
know
,
be
the
incarnation
of
selfishness
.
"
   
<EOS>
and
now
I
come
to
a
part
of
my
story
touch
myself
very
nearly
indeed
,
and
for
which
I
be
quite
unprepared
when
the
circumstance
occur
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
little
lingering
may
have
now
and
then
revive
in
my
mind
associate
with
my
poor
old
face
have
only
revive
as
belong
to
a
part
of
my
life
that
be
go
---
go
like
my
infancy
or
my
childhood
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
suppress
none
of
my
many
weakness
on
that
subject
,
but
have
write
them
as
faithfully
as
my
memory
have
recall
them
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
hope
to
do
,
and
mean
to
do
,
the
same
down
to
the
last
word
of
these
page
,
which
I
see
now
not
so
very
far
before
me
.
   
<EOS>
the
month
be
glide
away
,
and
my
dear
girl
,
sustain
by
the
hope
she
have
confide
in
me
,
be
the
same
beautiful
star
in
the
miserable
corner

<EOS>
Richard
,
more
worn
and
haggard
,
haunt
the
court
day
after
day
,
listlessly
sit
there
the
whole
day
long
when
he
know
there
be
no
remote
chance
of
the
suit
be
mention
,
and
become
one
of
the
stock
sight
of
the
place

I
wonder
whether
any
of
the
gentleman
remember
him
as
he
be
when
he
first
go
there
.
   
<EOS>
so

<EOS>
It
be
only
Mr
Woodcourt
who
could
occasionally
divert
his
attention
for
a
few
hour
at
a
time
and
rouse
him
,
even
when
he
sink
into
a
lethargy
of
mind
and
body
that
alarm
us
greatly
,
and
<EOS>
the
return
of
which
become
more
frequent
as
the
month
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
girl
be
right
in
say
that
he
only
pursue
his
error
the
more
desperately
for
her
sake
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
that
his
desire
to
retrieve
what
he
have
lose
be
render
the
more
intense
by
his
grief
for
his
young
wife
,
and
become
like
the
madness
of
a
gamester
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
there
,
as
I
have
mention
,
at
all
hour
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
be
there
at
night
,
I
generally
go
home
with
Charley
in
a
coach
;
sometimes
my
guardian
would
meet
me
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
we
would
walk
home
together
.
 
<EOS>
one
evening
he
have
arrange
to
meet
me
at
eight
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
leave
,
as
I
usually
do
,
quite
punctually
at
the
time
,
for
I
be
work
for
my
dear
girl
and
have
a
few
stitch
more
to
do
to
finish
what
I
be
about
;
but
it
be
within
a
few
minute
of
the
hour
when
I
bundle
up
my
little
work
-
basket
,
give
my
darling
my
last
kiss
for
the
night
,
and
hurry
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Woodcourt
go
with
me
,
as
it
be
dusk
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
the
usual
place
of
meeting
---
it
be
close
by
,
and
Mr
Woodcourt
have
often
accompany
me
before
---
my
guardian
be
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
We
wait
half
an
hour
,
walk
up
and
down
,
but
there
be
no
sign
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
agree
that
he
be
either
prevent
from
come
or
that
he
have
come
and
go
away
,
and
Mr
Woodcourt
propose
to
walk
home
with
me
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
the
first
walk
we
have
ever
take
together
,
except
that
very
short
one
to
the
usual
place
of
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
We
speak
of
Richard
and
Ada
the
whole
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
thank
him
in
word
for
what
he
have
do
---
my
appreciation
of
it
have
rise
above
all
word
then
---
but
I
hope
he
may
not
be
without
some
understanding
of
what
I
feel
so
strongly
.
   
<EOS>
arrive
at
home
and
go
upstairs
,
we
find
that
my
guardian
be
out
and
that
Mrs
Woodcourt
be
out
too
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
in
the
very
same
room
into
which
I
have
bring
my
blush
girl
when
her
youthful
lover
,
now
her
so
altered
husband
,
be
the
choice
of
her
young
heart
,
the
very
same
room
from
which
my
guardian
and
I
have
watch
them
go
away
through
the
sunlight
in
the
fresh
bloom
of
their
hope
and
promise
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
stand
by
the
open
window
look
down
into
the
street
when
Mr
Woodcourt
speak
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
learn
in
a
moment
that
he
love
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
learn
in
a
moment
that
my
scar
face
be
all
unchanged
to
him

<EOS>
I
learn
in
a
moment
that
what
I
have
think
be
pity
and
compassion
be
devote
,
generous

faithful
love

I

thrill

I
have
not

I
have
not

You
be
not
use
to
be
officer
;
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
everything
about
you
be
in
perfect
order
and
discipline
;
everything
about
me
require
to
be
keep
so
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
not
accustomed
to
carry
thing
with
the
same
hand
or
to
look
at
'em
from
the
same
point
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
much
about
my
garrison
manner
because
I
find
myself
pretty
well
at
my
ease
last
night
,
and
they
would
not
be
notice
here
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
once
and
away
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
shall
get
on
best
at
Chesney
Wold
,
where
there
be
more
room
for
a
weed
than
there
be
here
;
and
the
dear
old
lady
will
be
make
happy
besides
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
I
accept
of
Sir
Leicester
Dedlock
's
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
come
over
next
year
to
give
away
the
bride
,
or
<EOS>
whenever
I
come
,
I
shall
have
the
sense
to
keep
the
household
brigade
in
ambuscade
and
not
to
manoeuvre
it
on
your
ground
.
 
<EOS>
I
thank
you
heartily
again
and
be
proud
to
think
of
the
Rouncewells
as
they
will
be
found
by
you

"
You

better
than

<EOS>
take
your

<EOS>
so
that
we
do

now

I
will
ask
you

if
you
will
be
so
good

to
look
over
a
letter
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
bring
it
with
me
to
send
from
these
part
,
as
Chesney
Wold
may
be
a
painful
name
just
now
to
the
person
it
be
write
to
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
much
accustom
to
correspondence
myself
,
and
I
be
particular
respect
this
present
letter
because
I
want
it
to
be
both
straightforward
and
delicate

"
   
<EOS>
Herewith
<EOS>
he
hand
a
letter
,
closely
write
in
somewhat
pale
ink
but
in
a
neat
round
hand
,
to
the
ironmaster
,
who
read
as
follow
:
   
Miss
Esther

<EOS>
a

among
the

of
a
certain

,
I
take
the
liberty
to
make
known
to
you
that
it
be
but
a
few
line
of
instruction
from
abroad
,
when
,
where
,
and
how
to
deliver
an
enclose
letter
to
a
young

beautiful
lady
,
then
unmarrie
,
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
I
duly
observe
the

<EOS>
I
further
take
the
liberty
to
make
known
to
you
that
it
be
get
from
me
as
a
proof
of

and
that
otherwise
I
would
not

give
it
up
,
as
appear
to
be
the
most
harmless
in
my
possession
,
without
be
previously
shoot
through
the
heart
.
   
<EOS>
I
further
take
the
liberty
to
mention
that
if
I
could
have
suppose
a
certain
unfortunate
gentleman
to
have
be
in
existence
,
I
never
could
and
never
would
have
rest
until
I
have
discover
his
retreat
and
share
my
last
farthing
with
him
,
as
my
duty
and
my
inclination
would
have
equally
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
he

and
assuredly

of
a

hour
of

I

myself

both
from
officer

man
on
board
,
and
know
to
have
be

officially

<EOS>
I
further

the

that

that

this

Mr

<EOS>
His

however

unwilling

propose
to

early
in

the
subdued

of

on

Chapter
64
.
<EOS>
Esther
's
Narrative
 
<EOS>
soon
after
I
have
that
convertion
with
my
guardian
,
he
put
a
seal
paper
in
my
hand
one
morning
and
say
,
"
this
be
for
next
month
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
find
in
it
two
hundred
pound
.
   
<EOS>
I
now
begin
very
quietly
to
make
such
preparation
as
I
think
be
necessary
.
 
<EOS>
regulate
my
purchase
by
my
guardian
's
taste
,
which
I
know
very
well
of
course
,
I
arrange
my
wardrobe
to
please
him
and
hope
I
should
be
highly
successful
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
it
all
so
quietly
because
I
be
not
quite
free
from
my
old
apprehension
that
Ada
would
be
rather
sorry
and
because
my
guardian
be
so
quiet
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
that
under
all
the
circumstance
we
should
be
marry
in
the
most
private
and
simple
manner
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
I
should
only
have
to
say
to
Ada
,
"
Would
you
like
to
come
and
see
me
married
to
-
morrow
,
my
pet
?
"
 
<EOS>
perhaps
our
wedding
may
even
be
as
unpretende
as
her
own
,
and
I
may
not
find
it
necessary
to
say
anything
about
it
until
it
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
that
if
I
be
to
choose
,
I
would
like
this
good
.
   
<EOS>
the
only
exception
I
make
be
Mrs
Woodcourt
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
that
I
be
go
to
be
married
to
my
guardian
and
that
we
have
be
engage
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
She
highly
approve
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
never
do
enough
for
me
and
be
remarkably
soften
now
in
comparison
with
what
she
have
be
when
we
first
know
her
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
trouble
she
would
not
have
take
to
have
be
of
use
to
me
,
but
I
need
hardly
say
that
I
only
allow
her
to
take
as
little
as
<EOS>
gratify
her
kindness
without
task
it
.
   
<EOS>
of
course
this
be
not
a
time
to
neglect
my
guardian
,
and
of
course
it
be
not
a
time
for
neglect
my
darling
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
have
plenty
of
occupation
,
which
I
be
glad
of
;
and
as
to
Charley
,
she
be
absolutely
not
to
be
see
for
needlework
.
 
<EOS>
to
surround
herself
with
great
heap
of
it
---
basket
full
and
table
full
---
and
do
a
little
,
and
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
in
stare
with
her
round
eye
at
what
there
be
to
do
,
and
persuade
herself
that
she
be
go
to
do
it
,
be
Charley
's
great
dignity
and
delight
.
   
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
I
must
say
,
I
could
not
agree
with
my
guardian
on
the
subject
of
the
will
,
and
I
have
some
sanguine
hope
of
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
.
 
<EOS>
which
of
us
be
right
will
soon
appear
,
but
I
certainly
do
encourage
expectation
.
 
<EOS>
in
Richard
,
the
discovery
give
occasion
for
a
burst
of
business
and
agitation
that
buoy
him
up
for
a
little
time
,
but
he
have
lose
the
elasticity
even
of
hope
now
and
seem
to
me
to
retain
only
its
feverish
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
from
something
my
guardian
say
one
day
when
we
be
talk
about
this
,
I
understand
that
my
marriage
would
not
take
place
until
after
the
term
-
time
we
have
be
tell
to
look
forward
to
;
and
I
think
the
more
,
for
that
,
how
rejoice
I
should
be
if
I
could
be
marry
when
Richard
and
Ada
be
a
little
more
prosperous
.
   
<EOS>
the
term
be
very
near
indeed
when
my
guardian
be
call
out
of
town
and
go
down
into
Yorkshire
on
Mr
Woodcourt
's
business
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
tell
me
beforehand
that
his
presence
there
would
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
come
in
one
night
from
my
dear
girl
's
and
be
sit
in
the
midst
of
all
my
new
clothe
,
look
at
them
all
around
me
and
think
,
when
a
letter
from
my
guardian
be
bring
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
ask
me
to
join
him
in
the
country
and
mention
by
what
stage
-
coach
my
place
be
take
and
at
what
time
in
the
morning
I
should
have
to
leave
town
.
 
<EOS>
It
add
in
a
postscript
that
I
would
not
be
many
hour
from
Ada
.
   
<EOS>
I
expect
few
thing
less
than
a
journey
at
that
tinae
,
but
I
be
ready
for
it
in
half
an
hour
and
set
off
as
appoint
early
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
travel
all
day
,
wonder
all
day
what
I
could
be
want
for
at
such
a
distance
;
now
I
think
it
may
be
for
this
purpose
,
and
now
I
think
it
may
be
for
that
purpose
,
but
I
be
never
,
never
,
never
near
the
truth
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
night
when
I
come
to
my
journey
's
end
and
find
my
guardian
wait
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
great
relief
,
for
towards
evening
I
have
begin
to
fear
(
the
more
so
as
his
letter
be
a
very
short
one
)
that
he
may
be
ill
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
there
he
be
,
as
well
as
it
be
possible
to
be
;
and
<EOS>
when
I
see
his
genial
face
again
at
its
bright
and
good
,
I
say
to
myself
,
he
have
be
do
some
other
great
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
not
that
it
require
much
penetration
to
say
that
,
because
I
know
that
his
be
there
at
all
be
an
act
of
kindness
.
   
<EOS>
supper
be
ready
at
the
hotel
,
and
when
we
be
alone
at
table
he
say
,
"
full
of
curiosity
,
no
doubt
,
little
woman
,
to
know
why
I
have
bring
you
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
guardian
,
"
say
I
,
"
without
think
myself
a
Fatima
or
you
a
Blue
Beard
,
I
be
a
little
curious
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
then
to
ensure
your
night
's
rest
,
my
love
,
"
he
return
gaily
,
"
I
will
not
wait
until
to
-
morrow
to
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
very
much
wish
to
express
to
Woodcourt
,
somehow
,
my
sense
of
his
humanity
to
poor
unfortunate
Jo
,
his
inestimable
service
to
my
young
cousin
,
and
his
value
to
us
all
.
 
<EOS>
when
it
be
decide
that
he
should
settle
here
,
it
come
into
my
head
that
I
may
ask
his
acceptance
of
some
unpretending
and
suitable
little
place
to
lay
his
own
head
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
cause
such
a
place
to
be
look
out
for
,
and
such
a
place
be
find
on
very
easy
term
,
and
I
have
be
touch
it
up
for
him
and
make
it
habitable
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
when
I
walk
over
it
the
day
before
yesterday
and
it
be
report
ready
,
I
find
that
I
be
not
housekeeper
enough
to
know
whether
thing
be
all
as
they
ought
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
send
off
for
the
good
little
housekeeper
that
could
possibly
be
get
to
come
and
give
me
her
advice
and
opinion
.
<EOS>
and
here
she
be
,
"
say
my
guardian
,
"
laugh
and
cry
both
together
!
"
   
<EOS>
because
he
be
so
dear
,
so
good
,
so
admirable
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
to
tell
him
what
I
think
of
him
,
but
I
could
not
articulate
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
tut
,
tut
!
"
say
my
guardian
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
make
too
much
of
it
,
little
woman
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
how
you
sob
,
Dame
Durden
,
how
you
sob
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
with
exquisite
pleasure
,
guardian
---
with
a
heart
full
of
thank
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
"
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
delighted
that
you
approve
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
would
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
it
as
a
pleasant
surprise
for
the
little
mistress
of
Bleak
House
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
kiss
him
and
dry
my
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
now
!
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
this
in
your
face
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
no
;
<EOS>
have
you
really
,
my
dear
?
"
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
a
Dame
Durden
it
be
to
read
a
face
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
be
so
quaintly
cheerful
that
I
could
not
long
be
otherwise
,
and
be
almost
ashamed
of
have
be
otherwise
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
go
to
bed
,
I
cry
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
bind
to
confess
that
I
cry
;
but
I
hope
it
be
with
pleasure
,
though
I
be
not
quite
sure
it
be
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
I
repeat
every
word
of
the
letter
twice
over
.
   
<EOS>
a
most
beautiful
summer
morning
succeed
,
and
after
breakfast
we
go
out
arm
in
arm
to
see
the
house
of
which
I
be
to
give
my
mighty
housekeeping
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
We
enter
a
flower
-
garden
by
a
gate
in
a
side
wall
,
of
which
he
have
the
key
,
and
the
first
thing
I
see
be
that
the
bed
and
flower
be
all
lay
out
accord
to
the
manner
of
my
bed
and
flower
at
home
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
my
dear
,
"
observe
my
guardian
,
stand
still
with
a
delighted
face
to
watch
my
look
,
"
know
there
could
be
no
well
plan
,
I
borrow
yours
.
"
   
<EOS>
We
go
on
by
a
pretty
little
orchard
,
where
the
cherry
be
nestle
among
the
green
leave
and
the
shadow
of
the
apple
-
tree
be
sport
on
the
grass
,
to
the
house
itself
---
a
cottage
,
quite
a
rustic
cottage
of
doll
's
room
;
but
<EOS>
such
a
lovely
place
,
so
tranquil
and
so
beautiful
,
with
such
a
rich
and
smile
country
spread
around
it
;
with
water
sparkle
away
into
the
distance
,
here
all
overhang
with
summer
-
growth
<EOS>
,
there
turn
a
humming
mill
;
at
its
near
point
glance
through
a
meadow
by
the
cheerful
town
,
where
cricket
-
player
be
assemble
in
bright
group
and
a
flag
be
fly
from
a
white
tent
that
ripple
in
the
sweet
west
wind
.
<EOS>
and
still
,
as
we
go
through
the
pretty
room
,
out
at
the
little
rustic
verandah
door
,
and
underneath
the
tiny
wooden
colonnade
garland
with
woodbine
,
jasmine
,
and
honey
-
suckle
,
I
see
in
the
papering
on
the
wall
,
in
the
colour
of
the
furniture
,
in
the
arrangement
of
all
the
pretty
object
,
my
little
taste
and
fancy
,
my
little
method
and
invention
which
they
use
to
laugh
at
while
they
praise
them
,
my
odd
way
everywhere
.
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
say
enough
in
admiration
of
what
be
all
so
beautiful
,
but
one
secret
doubt
arise
in
my
mind
when
I
see
this
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
oh
,
would
he
be
the
happy
for
it
!
 
<EOS>
Would
it
not
have
be
well
for
his
peace
that
I
should
not
have
be
so
bring
before
him
?
<EOS>
because
although
I
be
not
what
he
think
me
,
still
he
love
me
very
dearly
,
and
it
may
remind
him
mournfully
of
what
be
believe
he
have
lose
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
wish
him
to
forget
me
<EOS>
---
perhaps
he
may
not
have
do
so
,
without
these
aid
to
his
memory
---
but
my
way
be
easy
than
his
,
and
I
could
have
reconcile
myself
even
to
that
so
that
he
have
be
the
happy
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
little
woman
,
"
say
my
guardian
,
whom
I
have
never
see
so
proud
and
joyful
as
in
show
me
these
thing
and
watch
my
appreciation
of
them
,
"
now

<EOS>

"
   
<EOS>
"
My

he
,
"

"
   
He
take
me
to
the
porch
,
which
he
have
hitherto
avoid
,
and
say
,
pause
before
we
go
out
,

I.
   
We
go
out
of
the
porch
and
he
show
me
write
over
it
,
Bleak
House

<EOS>
He
lead
me
to
a
seat
among
the
leave
close
by
,
and
sit
down
beside
me
and
take
my
hand
in

speak
to
me
thus
,
"
My

<EOS>
I
be
cold
,
and
I
tremble
violently
,
but
not
a
word

utter

lose

I
sit
look
fixedly
at
him

the
sun

ray
descend

softly
shine
through
the
leave
upon
his
bare
head

I
feel
as

be
like
the
brightness

It

<EOS>
I

him
round

We

late
as

to
go
to

minute
before

down

I
go
home
with
my

first
to
make
his

ludicrous

it
fall
out
that
in
laugh
about

I
tell
my

Sir

I

to
all

.
 
<EOS>
I

an
examination
that
be
enough
to
badger
a
man
blue
,
touch
a
pack
of
nonsense
that
he
do
not
want
to
know
)
on
the
roll
of
attorney
and
have
take
out
my
certificate
,
if
it
would
be
any
satisfaction
to
you
to
see
it

"
   
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
Mr
Guppy
,

return
my
guardian

<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
willing
 
---
I
believe
I
use
a
legal
phrase
---
to
admit
the
certificate
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Guppy
therefore
desist
from
take
something
out
of
his
pocket
and
proceed
without
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
no
capital
myself
,
but
my
mother
have
a
little
property
which
take
the
form
of
an
annuity
"
---
here
Mr
Guppy
's
mother
roll
her
head
as
if
she
never
could
sufficiently
enjoy
the
observation
,
and
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
mouth
,
and
again
wink
at
me
---
"
and
a
few
pound
for
expense
out
of
pocket
in
conduct
business
will
never
be
want
,
free
of
interest
,
which
be
an
advantage
,
you
know
,
"
say
Mr

feelingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
certainly
an
advantage

<EOS>
"
I

and
it
lay
in

of
Walcot
Square
,
Lambeth

<EOS>
I
have
therefore
take
a
'
ouse
in
that
locality
,
which
,
in
the
opinion
of
my
friend
,
be
a
hollow
bargain
(
taxis
ridiculous
,
and
use
of
fixture
include
in
the
rent
)
,
and
intend
set
up
professionally
for
myself
there
forthwith
.
"
   
<EOS>
here
Mr

's
mother
fall
into
an
extraordinary
passion
of
roll
her
head
and
smile
waggishly
at
anybody
who
would
look
at
her

<EOS>
"
It
be
a
six

roomer
,
exclusive
of
kitchen

"
say
Mr
Guppy
,
"
and
in
the
opinion
of
my
friend

a
commodious
tenement
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
mention
my
friend
,
I
refer
principally
to
my
friend
Jobling
,
who
I
believe
have
know
me
,
"
Mr
Guppy
look
at
him
with
a
sentimental
air
,
"
from
boyhood
's
hour
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jobling
confirm
this
with
a
slide
movement
of
his
leg

<EOS>
"
My

My

expire

consequently
there
will
be
no

<EOS>
My

<EOS>
Mr

I

I
wish

I

Its

Mr

<EOS>
"
then

if

I

and
my
guardian
find
an
intimation
from
Mr
Kenge
that
the
cause
would
come
on
in
two
day
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
have
sufficient
hope
of
the
will
to
be
in
a
flutter
about
it
,
Allan
and
I
agree
to
go
down
to
the
court
that
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
be
extremely
agitated
and
be
so
weak
and
low
,
though
his
illness
be
still
of
the
mind
,
that
my

indeed
have
sore
occasion
to

forward

a

little
way
now

to
the
help
that
be
to
come
to
her
,
and
never
droop
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
at
Westminster
that
the
cause
be
to
come
on
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
come
on
there
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
a
hundred
time
before
,
but
I
could
not
divest
myself
of
an
idea
that
it
may
lead
to
some
result
now
.
 
<EOS>
We
leave
home
directly
after
breakfast
to
be
at
Westminster
Hall
in
good
time
and
walk
down
there
through
the
lively
street
---
so
happily
and
strangely
it
seem
!
<EOS>
---
together
.
   
<EOS>
as
we
be
go
along
,
plan
what
we
should
do
for
Richard
and
Ada
,
I
hear
somebody
call
"
esther
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Esther
!
 
<EOS>
esther

"
<EOS>
and
there
be
Caddy
Jellyby
,
with
her
head
out
of
the
window
of
a
little
carriage
which
she
hire
now
to
go
about
in
to
her
pupil
<EOS>
(
she
have
so
many
)
,
as
if
she
want
to
embrace
me
at
a
hundred
yard
'
distance
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
write
her
a
note
to
tell
her
of
all
that
my
guardian
have
do
,
but
have
not
have
a
moment
to
go
and
see
her
.
<EOS>
of
course
we
turn
back
,
and
the
affectionate
girl
be
in
that
state
of
rapture
,
and
be
so
overjoyed
to
talk
about
the
night
when
she
bring
me
the
flower
,
and
be
so
determined
to
squeeze
my
face
(
bonnet
and
all
)
between
her
hand
,
and
go
on
in
a
wild
manner
altogether
,
call
me
all
kind
of
precious
name
,
and
tell
Allan
I
have
do
I
do
not
know
what
for
her
,
that
I
be
just
oblige
to
get
into
the
little
carriage
and
caln
her
down
by
let
her
say
and
do
exactly
what
she
like
.
 
<EOS>
Allan
,
stand
at
the
window
,
be
as
pleased
as
Caddy
;
and
I
be
as
pleased
as
either
of
them
;
and
I
wonder
that
I
get
away
as
I
do
,
rather
than
that
I
come
off
laughing
,
and
red
,
and
anything
but
tidy
,
and
look
after
Caddy
,
who
look
after
us
out
of
the
coach
-
window
as
long
as
she
could
see
us
.
   
<EOS>
this
make
us
some
quarter
of
an
hour
late
,
and
when
we
come
to
Westminster
Hall
we
find
that
the
day
's
business
be
begin
.
 
<EOS>
bad
than
that
,
we
find
such
an
unusual
crowd
in
the
Court
of
Chancery
that
it
be
full
to
the
door
,
and
we
could
neither
see
nor
hear
what
be
pass
within
.
 
<EOS>
It
appear
to
be
something
droll
,
for
occasionally
there
be
a
laugh
and
a
cry
of
"
Silence
!
"
 
<EOS>
It
appear
to
be
something
interesting
,
for
every
one
be
push
and
strive
to
get
near
.
 
<EOS>
It
appear
to
be
something
that
make
the
professional
gentleman
very
merry
,
for
there
be
several
young
counsellor
in
wig
and
whisker
on
the
outside
of
the
crowd
,
and
when
one
of
them
tell
the
other
about
it
,
they
put
their
hand
in
their
pocket
,
and
quite
double
themselves
up
with
laughter
,
and
go
stamp
about
the
pavement
of
the
Hall
.
   
<EOS>
We
ask
a
gentleman
by
us
if
he
know
what
cause
be
on
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
us
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
.
 
<EOS>
We
ask
him
if
he
know
what
be
do
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
really
,
no
he
do
not
,
nobody
ever
do
,
but
as
well
as
he
could
make
out
,
it
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
over
for
the
day
?
<EOS>
we
ask
him
.
<EOS>
no
,
he
say
,
over
for
good
.
   
<EOS>
over
for
good
!
   
<EOS>
when
we
hear
this
unaccountable
answer
,
we
look
at
one
another
quite
lose
in
amazement
.
 
<EOS>
Could
it
be
possible
that
the
will
have
set
thing
right
at
last
and
that
Richard
and
Ada
be
go
to
be
rich
?
 
<EOS>
It
seem
too
good
to
be
true
.
 
<EOS>
alas
it
be
!
   
<EOS>
Our
suspense
be
short
,
for
a
break
-
up
soon
take
place
in
the
crowd
,
and
the
people
come
stream
out
look
flushed
and
hot
and
bring
a
quantity
of
bad
air
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
still
they
be
all
exceedingly
amuse
and
be
more
like
people
come
out
from
a
farce
or
a
juggler
than
from
a
court
of
justice
.
 
<EOS>
We
stand
aside
,
watch
for
any
countenance
we
know
,
and
presently
great
bundle
of
paper
begin
to
be
carry
out
---
bundle
in
bag
,
bundle
too
large
to
be
get
into
any
bag
,
immense
masse
of
paper
of
all
shape
and
no
shape
,
which
the
bearer
stagger
under
,
and
throw
down
for
the
time
being
,
anyhow
,
on
the
Hall
pavement
,
while
they
go
back
to
bring
out
more
.
 
<EOS>
even
these
clerk
be
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
We
glance
at
the
paper
,
and
see
Jarndyce
and
Jarndyce
everywhere
,
ask
an
official
-
look
person
who
be
stand
in
the
midst
of

I

to
Richard

<EOS>
We
talk
about
them
all
the
morning

discuss
what
it
be
possible
to
do

<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
my
guardian
walk
with
me
to
Symond
's
Inn

at

I

upstairs

<EOS>
when
my

hear
my
footstep
,
she
come
out
into
the
small
passage
and
throw
her
arm
round
my
neck
,
but
she
compose
herself
directly
and
say
that
Richard
have
ask
for
me
several
time
.
 
<EOS>
Allan
have
find
him
sit
in
the
corner
of
the
court
,
she
tell
me
,
like
a
stone

<EOS>
on
be
rouse

he
have
break
away

make
as

<EOS>
He

stop
by

be
full
of
blood

and
Allan
have
bring
him
home

<EOS>
He
be
lie
on
a
sofa
with
his
eye
close
when
I
go
in
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
restorative
on
the
table
;
the
room
be
make
as
airy
as
possible
,
and
be
darken
,
and
be
very
orderly
and
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
Allan
stand
behind
him
watch
him
gravely
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
appear
to
me
to
be
quite
destitute
of
colour
,
and
now
that
I
see
him
without
his
see
me
,
I
fully
see
,
for
the
first
time
,
how
worn
away
he
be
.
<EOS>
but
he
look
handsome
than
I
have
see
him
look
for
many
a
day
.
   
<EOS>
I
sit
down
by
his
side
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
open
his
eye
by
and
by
<EOS>
,
he
say
in
a
weak
voice
,
but
with
his
old
smile
,
"
Dame
Durden
,
kiss
me
,
my
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
comfort
and
surprise
to
me
to
find
him
in
his
low
state
cheerful
and
look
forward
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
happy
,
he
say
,
in
our
intend
marriage
than
he
could
find
word
to
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
My
husband
have
be
a
guardian
angel
to
him
and
Ada
,
and
he
bless
us
both
and
wish
us
all
the
joy
that
life
could
yield
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
almost
feel
as
if
my
own
heart
would
have
break
when
I
see
him
take
my
husband
's
hand
and
hold
it
to
his
breast
.
   
<EOS>
We
speak
of
the
future
as
much
as
possible
,
and
he
say
several
time
that
he
must
be
present
at
our
marriage
if
he
could
stand
upon
his
foot
.
 
<EOS>
Ada
would
contrive
to
take
him
,
somehow
,
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
yes

<EOS>
but
as
my

him
thus
hopefully

so
serene
and
beautiful
,
with
the
help
that
be
to
come
to
her
so
near
---
I
know
---
I
know
!
   
<EOS>
It
be
not
good
for
him
to
talk
too
much
,
and
when
he
be
silent
,
we
be
silent
too
.
 
<EOS>
sit
beside
him
,
I
make
a
pretence
of
work
for
my

always
be

about

Ada
lean
upon

He

say
first
of
all
,
"

<EOS>
evening
have
come
on

He
clasp

Chapter

<EOS>
down
in
Lincolnshire
 
there
be
a
hush
upon
Chesney
Wold
in
these
alter
day
,
as
there
be
upon
a
portion
of
the
family
history
.
 
<EOS>
the
story
go
that
Sir
Leicester
pay
some
who
could
have
speak
out
to
hold
their
peace
;
but
it
be
a
lame
story
,
feebly
whisper
and
creep
about
,
and
any
bright
spark
of
life
it
show
soon
die
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
know
for
certain
that
the
handsome
Lady
Dedlock
lie
in
the
mausoleum
in
the
park
,
where
the
tree
arch
darkly
overhead
,
and
the
owl
be
hear
at
night
make
the
wood
ring
;
but
whence
she
be
bring
home
to
be
lay
among
the
echo
of
that
solitary
place
,
or
how
she
die
,
be
all
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
her
old
friend
,
principally
to
be
find
among
the
peachy
-
cheek
charmer
with
the
skeleton
throat
,
do
once
occasionally
say
,
as
they
toy
in
a
ghastly
manner
with
large
fan
---
like
charmer
reduce
to
flirt
with
grim
death
,
after
lose
all
their
other
beaux
---
<EOS>
do
once
occasionally
say
,
when
the
world
assemble
together
,
that
they
wonder
the
ashe
of
the
Dedlocks
,
entomb
in
the
mausoleum
,
never
rise
against
the
profanation
of
her
company
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
dead
-
and
-
go
Dedlocks
take
it
very
calmly
and
have
never
be
know
to
object
.
   
<EOS>
up
from
among
the
fern
in
the
hollow
,
and
wind
by
the
bridle
-
road
among
the
tree
,
come
sometimes
to
this
lonely
spot
the
sound
of
horse
'
hoofs
.
 
<EOS>
then
may
be
see
<EOS>
Sir
Leicester
---
invalided
,
bent
,
and
almost
blind
,
but
of
worthy
presence
yet
---
ride
with
a
stalwart
man
beside
him
,
constant
to
his
bridle
-
rein
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
come
to
a
certain
spot
before
the
mausoleum
-
door
,
Sir
Leicester
's
accustomed
horse
stop
of
his
own
accord
,
and
Sir
Leicester
,
pull
off
his
hat
,
be
still
for
a
few
moment
before
they
ride
away
.
   
<EOS>
war
rage
yet
with
the
audacious
Boythorn
,
though
at
uncertain
interval
,
and
now
hotly
,
and
now
coolly
,
flicker
like
an
unsteady
fire
.
 
<EOS>
the
truth
be
say
to
be
that
when
Sir
Leicester
come
down
to
Lincolnshire
for
good
,
Mr
Boythorn
show
a
manifest
desire
to
abandon
his
right
of
way
and
do
whatever
Sir
Leicester
would
,
which
Sir
Leicester
,
conceive
to
be
a
condescension
to
his
illness
or
misfortune
,
take
in
such
high
dudgeon
,
and
be
so
magnificently
aggrieve
by
,
that
Mr
Boythorn
find
himself
under
the
necessity
of
commit
a
flagrant
trespass
to
restore
his
neighbour
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
similarly
,
Mr
Boythorn
continue
to
post
tremendous
placard
on
the
dispute
thoroughfare
and
(
with
his
bird
upon
his
head
)
to
hold
forth
vehemently
against
Sir
Leicester
in
the
sanctuary
of
his
own
home
;
similarly
,
also
,
he
defy
him
as
of
old
in
the
little
church
by
testify
a
bland
unconsciousness
of
his
existence
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
whisper
that
when
he
be
most
ferocious
towards
his
old
foe
,
he
be
really
most
considerate
,
and
that
Sir
Leicester
,
in
the
dignity
of
be
implacable
,
little
suppose
how
much
he
be
humour
.
 
<EOS>
as
little
do
he
think
how
near
together
he
and
his
antagonist
have
suffer
in
the
fortune
of

sister
,
and
his
antagonist
,
who
know
it
now

be
not

go

to

on

to
observe
---
 
which

be
scant

in

the
relation

<EOS>
They
have
visitor
in

the

the

the

when
something

in

<EOS>
then
,
indeed
,
do
the
tucker
sylph
come
out
in
fairy
form

proceed
with
joy
under
cousinly
escort
to
the
exhausted
old

fourteen

which
,
during

room
full

<EOS>
then
,
indeed
,
do
she
captivate
all
heart
by
her
condescension
,
by
her
girlish
vivacity
,
and
by
her
skip
about

in
the
day
when
the
hideous
old

too
full
of

monotonous

<EOS>
a
labyrinth
of
grandeur
,
less
the
property
of
an
old

of
human
being

their
ghostly

than
of
an
old
family
of
echoing
and
thundering
which
start
out
of
their
hundred
grave
at
every
sound
and
go
resound
through
the
building
.
 
<EOS>
a
waste
of
unused
passage
and
staircase
in
which
to
drop
a
comb
upon
a
bedroom
floor
at
night
be
to
send
a
stealthy
footfall
on
an
errand
through
the
house

<EOS>
a
place
where
few
people
care
to
go

where

scream

if
an
ash
drop
from
the
fire

take
to
cry
at
all
time

become

give
warning

depart

thus
Chesney

with

much

darkness

sombre

motionless

<EOS>
It
be
a
boy
;
and
<EOS>
I
,
my
husband
,
and
my
guardian
give
him
his
father
's
name
.
   
<EOS>
the
help
that
my
dear
count
on
do
come
to
her
,
though
it
come
,
in
the
eternal
wisdom
,
for
another
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
though
to
bless
and
restore
his
mother
,
not
his
father
,
be
the
errand
of
this
baby
,
its
power
be
mighty
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
see
the
strength
of
the
weak
little
hand
and
how
its
touch
could
heal
my
darling
's
heart
and
raise
hope
within
her
,
I
feel
a
new
sense
of
the
goodness
and
the
tenderness
of
God
.
   
<EOS>
They
throve
,
and
by
degree
<EOS>
I
see
my
dear
girl
pass
into
my
country
garden
and
walk
there
with
her
infant
in
her
arm
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
married
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
the
happy
of
the
happy
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
at
this
time
that
my
guardian
join
us
and
ask
Ada
when
she
would
come
home
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
both
house
be
your
home
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
"
but
the
old
Bleak
House
claim
priority
.
 
<EOS>
when
you
and
my
boy
be
strong
enough
to
do
it
,
come
and
take
possession
of
your
home
.
"
   
<EOS>
Ada
call
him
"
her
dear
cousin
,
John
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
he
say
,
no
,
it
must
be
guardian
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
her
guardian
henceforth
,
and
the
boy
be
;
and
he
have
an
old
association
with
the
name
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
call
him
guardian
,
and
have
call
him
guardian
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
know
him
by
no
other
name
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
the
child
;
I
have
two
little
daughter
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
difficult
to
believe
that
Charley
(
round
-
eyed
still
,
and
not
at
all
grammatical
)
be
marry
to
a
miller
in
our
neighbourhood
;
yet
so
it
be
;
and
even
now
,
look
up
from
my
desk
as
I
write
early
in
the
morning
at
my
summer
window
<EOS>
,
I
see
the
very
mill
begin
to
go
round
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
the
miller
will
not
spoil
Charley
;
but
he
be
very
fond
of
her
,
and
Charley
be
rather
vain
of
such
a
match
,
for
he
be
well
to
do
and
be
in
great
request
.
 
<EOS>
so
far
as
my
small
maid
be
concern
,
I
may
suppose
time
to
have
stand
for
seven
year
as
still
as
the
mill
do
half
an
hour
ago
,
since
little
Emma
,
Charley
's
sister
,
be
exactly
what
Charley
use
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
Tom
,
Charley
's
brother
,
I
be
really
afraid
to
say
what
he
do
at
school
in
cipher
,
but
I
think
it
be
decimal
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
apprentice
to
the
miller
,
whatever
it
be
,
and
be
a
good
bashful
fellow
,
always
fall
in
love
with
somebody
and
be
ashamed
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
Caddy
Jellyby
pass
her
very
last
holiday
with
us
and
be
a
dearer
creature
than
ever
,
perpetually
dance
in
and
out
of
the
house
with
the
child
as
if
she
have
never
give
a
dancing
-
lesson
in
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
Caddy
keep
her
own
little
carriage
now
instead
of
hire
one
,
and
live
full
two
mile
further
westward
than
Newman
Street
.
 
<EOS>
She
work
very
hard
,
her
husband
(
an
excellent
one
)
be
lame
and
able
to
do
very
little
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
she
be
more
than
contented
and
do
all
she
have
to
do
with
all
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jellyby
spend
his
evening
at
her
new
house
with
his
head
against
the
wall
as
he
use
to
do
in
her
old
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hear
that
Mrs
Jellyby
be
understand
to
suffer
great
mortification
from
her
daughter
's
ignoble
marriage
and
pursuit
,
but
I
hope
she
get
over
it
in
time
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
disappoint
in
Borrioboola
-
Gha
,
which
turn
out
a
failure
in
consequence
of
the
king
of
Boorioboola
want
to
sell
everybody
---
who
survive
the
climate
---
for
rum
,
but
she
have
take
up
with
the
right
of
woman
to
sit
in
Parliament
,
and
Caddy
tell
me
it
be
a
mission
involve
more
correspondence
than
the
old
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
almost
forget
Caddy
's
poor
little
girl
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
not
such
a
mite
now
,
but
she
be
deaf
and
dumb
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
there
never
be
a
well
mother
than
Caddy
,
who
learn
,
in
her
scanty
interval
of
leisure
,
innumerable
deaf
and
dumb
art
to
soften
the
affliction
of
her
child
.
   
<EOS>
as
if
I
be
never
to
have
do
with
Caddy
,
I
be
remind
here
of
Peepy
and
old
Mr
Turveydrop
.
 
<EOS>
Peepy
be
in
the
Custom
House
,
and
do
extremely
well
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Mr
Turveydrop
,
very
apoplectic
,
still
exhibit
his
deportment
about
town
,
still
enjoy
himself
in
the
old
manner
,
be
still
believe
in
in
the
old
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
constant
in
his
patronage
of
Peepy
and
be
understand
to
have
bequeath
him
a
favourite
french
clock
in
his
dressing
-
room
---
which
be
not
his
property
.
   
<EOS>
with
the
first
money
we
save
at
home
,
we
add
to
our
pretty
house
by
throw
out
a
little
growlery
expressly
for
my
guardian
,
which
we
inaugurate
with
great
splendour
the
next
time
he
come
down
to
see
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
to
write
all
this
lightly
,
because
my
heart
be
full
in
draw
to
an
end
,
but
when
I
write
of
him
,
my
tear
will
have
their
way
.
   
<EOS>
I
never
look
at
him
<EOS>
but
I
hear
our
poor
dear
Richard
call
him
a
good
man
.
 
<EOS>
to
Ada
and
her
pretty
boy
,
he
be
the
fond
father
;
to
me
he
be
what
he
have
ever
be
,
and
what
name
can
I
give
to
that
?
<EOS>
He
be
my
husband
's
good
and
dear
friend
,
he
be
our
child
's
darling
,
he
be
the
object
of
our
deep
love
and
veneration
.
 
<EOS>
yet
while
I
feel
towards
him
as
if
he
be
a
superior
being
,
I
be
so
familiar
with
him
and
so
easy
with
him
that
I
almost
wonder
at
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
lose
my
old
name
,
nor
have
he
lose
his
;
nor
do
I
ever
,
when
he
be
with
us
,
sit
in
any
other
place
than
in
my
old
chair
at
his
side
,
Dame
Trot
,
Dame
Durden
,
Little
Woman
---
all
just
the
same
as
ever
;
and
I
answer
,
"
yes
,
dear
guardian
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
just
the
same
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
never
know
the
wind
to
be
in
the
east
for
a
single
moment
since
the
day
when
he
take
me
to
the
porch
to
read
the
name
.
 
<EOS>
I
remark
to
him
once
that
the
wind
seem
never
in
the
east
now
,
and
he
say
,
no
,
truly
;
it
have
finally
depart
from
that
quarter
on
that
very
day
.
   
<EOS>
I
think
my
darling
girl
be
more
beautiful
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
the
sorrow
that
have
be
in
her
face
---
for
it
be
not
there
now
---
seem
to
have
purify
even
its
innocent
expression
and
to
have
give
it
a
diviner
quality
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
when
I
raise
my
eye
and
see
her
in
the
black
dress
that
she
still
wear
,
teach
my
Richard
<EOS>
,
I
feel
---
it
be
difficult
to
express
---
as
if
it
be
so
good
to
know
that
she
remember
her
dear
Esther
in
her
prayer
.
   
<EOS>
I
call
him
my
Richard
!
 
<EOS>
but
he
say
that
he
have
two
mama
,
and
I
be
one
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
not
rich
in
the
bank
,
but
we
have
always
prosper
,
and
we
have
quite
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
walk
out
with
my
husband
<EOS>
but
I
hear
the
people
bless
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
go
into
a
house
of
any
degree
<EOS>
but
I
hear
his
praise
or
see
them
in
grateful
eye
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
lie
down
at
night
<EOS>
but
I
know
that
in
the
course
of
that
day
he
have
alleviate
pain
and
soothe
some
fellow
-
creature
in
the
time
of
need
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
from
the
bed
of
those
who
be
past
recovery
,
thank
have
often
,
often
go
up
,
in
the
last
hour
,
for
his
patient
ministration
.
 
<EOS>
be
not
this
to
be
rich
?
   
<EOS>
the
people
even
praise
me
as
the
doctor
's
wife
.
 
<EOS>
the
people
even
like
me
as
I
go
about
,
and
make
so
much
of
me
that
I
be
quite
abash
.
 
<EOS>
I
owe
it
all
to
him
,
my
love
,
my
pride
!
 
<EOS>
They
like
me
for
his
sake
,
as
I
do
everything
I
do
in
life
for
his
sake
.
   
<EOS>
a
night
or
two
ago
,
after
bustle
about
prepare
for
my
darling
and
my
guardian
and
little
Richard
,
who
be
come
to
-
morrow
,
I
be
sit
out
in
the
porch
of
all
place
,
that
dearly
memorable
porch
,
when
Allan
come
home
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
say
,
"
My
precious
little
woman
,
what
be

here
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
I
say
,
"
the
moon

so
brightly
,
Allan
,
and
the
night
be
so
delicious
,
that
I

"
   
<EOS>
"
what
have

about
,
my
dear

"
say
Allan
then
.
   
<EOS>
"
how
curious
you
be
!
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
almost
ashamed
to
tell
you
,
but
I
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
think
about
my
old
look
---
such
as
they
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
and
what
have
you
be
think
about
them
,
my
busy
bee
?
"
say
Allan
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
think
that
I
think
it
be
impossible
that
you
COULD
have
love
me
any
better
,
even
if
I
have
retain
them
.
"
   
"
<EOS>
"
such
as
they
be
"
?
"
say
Allan
,
laugh
.
   
<EOS>
"
such
as
they
be
,
of
course
.
"
   
"
My
dear
Dame
Durden
,
"
say
Allan
,
draw
my
arm
through
his
,
"
do
you
ever
look
in
the
glass
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
do
;
you
see
me

"
   
<EOS>
"
and
do
not
you
know
that
you
be
pretty
than
you
ever

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
;
I
be
not
certain
that
I
know
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
know
that
my

little
pet
be
very
pretty
,
and
that
my
darling

very
beautiful

and
that

and
that
my

most
benevolent
face
that
