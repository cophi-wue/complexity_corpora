<EOS>
I
in
which
certain
personage
of
this
delightful
history
be
introduce
to
the
reader
's
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
on
the
great
northern
road
from
York
to
London
,
about
the
beginning
of
the
month
October
,
and
the
hour
of
eight
in
the
evening
,
that
four
traveller
be
by
a
violent
shower
of
rain
drive
for
shelter
into
a
little
public
house
on
the
side
of
the
highway
,
distinguish
by
a
sign
which
be
say
to
exhibit
the
figure
of
a
black
lion
.
   
<EOS>
the
kitchen
,
in
which
they
assemble
,
be
the
only
room
for
entertainment
in
the
house
,
pave
with
red
brick
,
remarkably
clean
,
furnish
with
three
or
four
Windsor
chair
,
adorn
with
shine
plate
of
pewter
,
and
copper
sauce
-
pan
nicely
scour
,
that
even
dazzle
the
eye
of
the
beholder
;
while
a
chearful
fire
of
sea
-
coal
blaze
in
the
chimney
.
<EOS>
three
of
the
traveller
,
who
arrive
on
horseback
,
have
see
their
cattle
properly
accommodate
in
the
stable
,
agree
to
pass
the
time
,
until
the
weather
should
clear
up
,
over
a
bowl
of
rumbo
,
which
be
accordingly
prepared
:
but
the
fourth
,
refuse
to
join
their
company
,
take
his
station
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
chimney
,
and
call
for
a
pint
of
two
-
penny
,
with
which
he
indulge
himself
apart
.
<EOS>
at
a
little
distance
,
on
his
left
hand
,
there
be
another
groupe
,
consist
of
the
landlady
a
decent
widow
,
her
two
daughter
,
the
elder
of
whom
seem
to
be
about
the
age
of
fifteen
,
and
a
country
lad
,
who
serve
both
as
waiter
and
ostler
.
   
<EOS>
the
social
triumvirate
be
compose
of
Mr
Fillet
,
a
country
practitioner
in
surgery
and
midwifery
,
Capt
Crowe
,
and
his
nephew
Mr
Thomas
Clarke
,
an
attorney
.
<EOS>
Fillet
be
a
man
of
some
education
,
and
a
great
deal
of
experience
,
shrewd
,
sly
,
and
sensible
.
<EOS>
Capt
Crowe
have
command
a
merchant
-
ship
in
the
Mediterranean
-
trade
for
many
year
,
and
save
some
money
by
dint
of
frugality
and
traffick
.
<EOS>
He
be
an
excellent
seaman
,
brave
,
active
,
friendly
in
his
way
,
and
scrupulously
honest
;
but
as
little
acquaint
with
the
world
as
a
suck
child
;
whimsical
,
impatient
,
and
so
impetuous
that
he
could
not
help
break
in
upon
the
conversation
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
with
repeat
interruption
,
that
seem
to
burst
from
him
by
involuntary
impulse
<EOS>
:
when
he
himself
attempt
to
speak
,
he
never
finish
his
period
;
but
make
such
a
number
of
abrupt
transition
,
that
his
discourse
seem
to
be
an
unconnected
series
of
unfinished
sentence
,
the
meaning
of
which
it
be
not
easy
to
decypher
.
   
<EOS>
His
nephew
,
Tom
Clarke
,
be
a
young
fellow
,
whose
goodness
of
heart
even
the
exercise
of
his
profession
have
not
be
able
to
corrupt
.
<EOS>
before
stranger
he
never
own
himself
an
attorney
,
without
blush
,
though
he
have
no
reason
to
blush
for
his
own
practice
;
for
he
constantly
refuse
to
engage
in
the
cause
of
any
client
whose
character
be
equivocal
,
and
be
never
know
to
act
with
such
industry
as
when
concern
for
the
widow
and
orphan
,
or
any
other
object
that
sue
in
forma
pauperis
.
<EOS>
indeed
he
be
so
replete
with
human
kindness
,
that
as
often
as
an
affect
story
or
circumstance
be
tell
in
his
hearing
,
it
overflow
at
his
eye
.
<EOS>
be
of
a
warm
complexion
,
he
be
very
susceptible
of
passion
,
and
somewhat
libertine
in
his
amour
.
   
<EOS>
in
other
respect
,
he
pique
himself
on
understand
the
practice
of
the
court
,
and
in
private
company
he
take
pleasure
in
lay
down
the
law
;
but
he
be
an
indifferent
orator
,
and
tediously
circumstantial
in
his
explanation
:
his
stature
be
rather
diminutive
;
but
,
upon
the
whole
,
he
have
some
title
to
the
character
of
a
pretty
,
dapper
,
little
fellow
.
<EOS>
the
solitary
guest
have
something
very
forbidding
in
his
aspect
,
which
be
contract
by
an
habitual
frown
.
<EOS>
His
eye
be
small
and
red
,
and
so
deep
set
in
the
socket
,
that
each
appear
like
the
undistinguished
snuff
of
a
farthing
-
candle
,
gleam
through
the
horn
of
a
dark
lanthorn
.
<EOS>
His
nostril
be
elevate
in
scorn
,
as
if
his
sense
of
smell
have
be
perpetually
offend
by
some
unsavory
odour
;
and
he
look
as
if
he
want
to
shrink
within
himself
,
from
the
impertinence
of
society
.
<EOS>
He
wear
a
black
periwig
as
straight
as
the
pinion
of
a
raven
,
and
this
be
cover
with
an
hat
flap
,
and
fasten
to
his
head
by
a
speckled
handkerchief
tie
under
his
chin
.
<EOS>
He
be
wrap
in
a
great
coat
of
brown
frize
,
under
which
he
seem
to
conceal
a
small
bundle
.
<EOS>
His
name
be
Ferret
,
and
his
character
distinguish
by
three
peculiarity
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
never
see
to
smile
:
he
be
never
hear
to
speak
in
praise
of
any
person
whatsoever
;
and
he
be
never
know
to
give
a
direct
answer
to
any
question
that
be
ask
:
but
seem
,
on
all
occasion
,
to
be
actuate
by
the
most
perverse
spirit
of
contradiction
.
   
<EOS>
Capt
Crowe
,
have
remark
that
it
be
squally
weather
,
ask
how
far
it
be
to
the
next
market
-
town
;
and
understanding
that
the
distance
be
not
less
than
six
mile
,
say
he
have
a
good
mind
to
come
to
an
anchor
for
the
night
,
if
so
be
as
he
could
have
a
tolerable
berth
in
this
here
harbour
.
<EOS>
Mr
Fillet
,
perceive
by
his
stile
that
he
be
a
sea
-
fare
gentleman
,
observe
that
their
landlady
be
not
use
to
lodge
such
company
;
and
express
some
surprize
,
that
he
who
have
no
doubt
endure
so
many
storm
and
hardship
at
sea
,
should
think
much
of
travel
five
or
six
mile
a
horseback
by
moon
-
light
.
"
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
say
he
,
I
ride
in
all
weather
,
and
at
all
hour
,
without
mind
cold
,
wet
,
wind
,
or
darkness
.
<EOS>
My
constitution
be
so
case
-
harden
,
that
I
believe
I
could
live
all
the
year
at
Spitzbergen
.
<EOS>
with
respect
to
this
road
,
I
know
every
foot
of
it
so
exactly
,
that
I
will
engage
to
travel
forty
mile
upon
it
blindfold
,
without
make
one
false
step
;
and
if
you
have
faith
enough
to
put
yourself
under
my
auspex
,
I
will
conduct
you
safe
to
an
elegant
inn
,
where
you
will
meet
with
the
good
accommodation
.
"
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
brother
,
(
reply
the
Captain
:
)
<EOS>
we
be
much
beholden
to
you
for
your
courteous
offer
;
but
,
howsomever
,
you
must
not
think
I
mind
foul
weather
more
than
my
neighbour
.
<EOS>
I
have
work
hard
aloft
and
allow
in
many
a
taught
gale
       
<EOS>
but
this
here
be
the
case
,
<EOS>
d'ye
see
;
we
have
run
down
a
long
day
's
reckoning
:
our
beast
have
have
a
hard
spell
;
and
as
for
my
own
hap
,
brother
,
I
doubt
my
bottom
-
plank
have
lose
some
of
their
sheathing
,
be
as
how
I
a'n't
use
to
that
kind
of
scrubbing
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
who
have
practise
on
board
a
man
of
war
in
his
youth
,
and
be
perfectly
well
acquaint
with
the
Captain
's
dialect
,
assure
him
,
that
if
his
bottom
be
damage
,
he
would
new
-
pay
it
with
an
excellent
salve
,
which
he
always
carry
about
him
,
to
guard
against
such
accident
on
the
road
:
but
Tom
Clarke
,
who
seem
to
have
cast
the
eye
of
affection
upon
the
landlady
's
eld
daughter
,
Dolly
,
object
to
their
proceeding
farther
without
rest
and
refreshment
,
as
they
have
already
travel
fifty
mile
since
morning
;
and
he
be
sure
his
uncle
must
be
fatigue
both
in
mind
and
body
,
from
vexation
as
well
as
from
a
hard
exercise
,
to
which
he
have
not
be
accustom
.
<EOS>
Fillet
then
desist
,
say
,
he
be
sorry
to
find
the
Captain
have
any
cause
for
vexation
;
but
he
hope
it
be
not
an
incurable
evil
.
<EOS>
this
expression
be
accompany
with
a
look
of
curiosity
,
which
Mr
Clarke
be
glad
of
an
occasion
to
gratify
;
for
,
as
we
have
hint
above
,
he
be
a
very
communicative
gentleman
,
and
the
affair
which
now
lie
upon
his
stomach
interest
him
nearly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
assure
you
,
Sir

(
say
he
)
<EOS>
this

captain
Crowe
,
who
be
my
mother
's
own
brother
,
have
be
cruelly

by
some
of
his
relation

<EOS>
He
bear
as
good
a
character
as
any
captain
of
a
ship
on
the
Royal
Exchange
,
and
have
undergo
a
variety
of
hardship
at
sea
.
<EOS>

"
   
<EOS>
here
Mr
Ferret

proper
to
intermingle
in
the
conversation
with
a
"
Pish
,
what
,
do'st
talk
of

<EOS>
Do'st

"
<EOS>
"
give
me
leave
,
Sir
,
(
reply
Tom
)
<EOS>
I
presume
you
be
a
practitioner
in
the
law
.
<EOS>
now
you
know
,
that
in
the
case
of
a
contingent
remainder
,
the
intail
may
be
destroy
by
levy
a
fine
,
and
suffer
a
recovery
;
or
otherwise
destroy
the
particular
estate
,
before
the
contingency
happen
.
   
<EOS>
if
feoffee
,
who
possess
an
estate
only
during
the
life
of
a
son
,
where
diver
remainder
be
limit
over
,
make
a
feoffment
in
fee

,
by
the
feoffment
all
the

<EOS>
indeed
,
a
person
in
remainder
may
have
a
writ
of
intrusion
,
if
any
do
intrude
after
the
death
of
a
tenant
for
life
;
and
the
writ
ex
gravi
querela
lie
to
execute
a
devise
in
remainder
,
after
the
death
of
tenant
in
tail
without
issue
.
"
      
<EOS>
"
speak
like
a
true
disciple
of
Geber
,
"
cry
Ferrett
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
Sir
,
(
reply
Mr
Clarke
<EOS>
)
counsellor
Caper
be
in
the
conveyancing
-
way
      
<EOS>
I
be
clerk
to
serjeant
Croaker
.
"
<EOS>
"
ay
,
now
you
may
set
up
for
yourself
;
(
resume
the
other
)
for
you
can
prate
as
unintelligibly
as
the
good
of
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
perhaps
(
say
Tom
)
<EOS>
I
do
not
make
myself
understand
:
if
so
be
as
how
that
be
the
case
,
let
us
change
the
position
;
and
suppose
that
this
here
case
be
a
tail
after
a
possibility
of
issue
extinct
.
   
<EOS>
if
a
tenant
in
tail
,
after
a
possibility
,
make
a
feoffment
of
his
land
,
he
in
reversion
may
enter
for
the
forfeiture
.
<EOS>
then
we
must
make
a
distinction
between
general
tail
and
special
tail
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
word
body
that
make
the
intail
:
       
there
must
be
body
in
the
tail
,
devise
to
heir
male
or
female
,
otherwise
it

Capt

Tom

wildly

the

startled
,

betray
evident
mark
of
confusion
.
<EOS>
the

the
good

with

creep
close

<EOS>

up

"
these

"
   
<EOS>
the
landlady
beg
him
,
for
christis
sake
,
not
to
think
of
go
out
;
for
it
be
a
spirit
that
would
lead
him
astray
into
fen
and
river
,
and
certainly
do
him
a
mischief
.
<EOS>
Crowe
seem
to
be
stagger
by
this
remonstrance
,
which
his
nephew
reinforce
,
observe
,
that
it
may
be
a
stratagem
of
rogue
to
decoy
them
into
the
field
,
that
they
may
rob
them
under
cloud
of
night
.
<EOS>
thus
exhort
,
he
resume
his
seat
;
and
Mr
Ferret
begin
to
make
very
severe
stricture
upon
the
folly
and
fear
of
those
who
believe
and
tremble
at
the
visitation
of
spirit
,
ghost
,
and
goblin
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
he
would
engage
with
twelve
penny
-
worth
of
phosphorus
to
frighten
a
whole
parish
out
of
their
sense
:
then
he
expatiate
on
the
pusillanimity
of
the
nation
in
general
;
ridicule
the
militia
,
censure
the
government
;
and
drop
some
hint
about
a
change
of
hand
,
which
the
Captain
could
not

and
the
Doctor
would
not
comprehend

<EOS>
Tom
Clarke
,
from
the
freedom
of
his
discourse
,
conclude
he
be
a
ministerial
spy
,
and
communicate
his
opinion
to
his
uncle
in
a
whisper
,
while
this
misanthrope
continue
to
pour
forth
his
invective
with
a
fluency
peculiar
to
himself
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
Mr
Ferret
have
be
a
party
-
writer
,
not
from
principle
,
but
employment
,
and
have
feel
the
rod
of
power
;
in
order
to
avoid
a
second
exertion
of
which
,
he
now
find
it
convenient
to
sculk
about
in
the
country
:
for
he
have
receive
intimation
of
a
warrant
from
the
secretary
of
state
,
who
want
to
be
better
acquaint
with
his
person
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
ticklish
nature
of
his
situation
,
it
be
become
so
habitual
to
him
to
think
and
speak
in
a
certain
manner
,
that
even
before
stranger
,
whose
principle
and
connexion
he
could
not
possibly
know
,
he
hardly
ever
open
his
mouth
,
without
utter
some
direct
or
imply
sarcasm
against
the
government
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
already
proceed
a
considerable
way
in
demonstrating
,
that
the
nation
be
bankrupt
and
beggared
,
and
that
those
who
stand
at
the
helm
be
steer
full
into
the
gulph
of
inevitable
destruction
;
when
his
lecture
be
suddenly
suspend
by
a
violent
knocking
at
the
door
,
which
threaten
the
whole

with
immediate
demolition

<EOS>
Capt
Crowe
,
believe
they
should
be
instantly
board
,
unsheathe
his
hanger

stand
in

posture
of
defence

<EOS>
Mr

arm
himself
with

which
happen

as
for
Mr

he
prudently
withdraw
into

<EOS>
but
as
a
personage
of
great
importance
in
this
entertaining
history
be
force
to
remain
some
time
at

before

<EOS>
that
smote
the
heart
of
our

with
fear

<EOS>
It

to
the

in
these

:
   
"
<EOS>

good

at

unusual
appearance
,
which
I

take
an
opportunity
to
explain
;
and
forgive
the
rude
and
boisterous
manner
in
which
I
have
demand
,
and
indeed
force
admittance
.
<EOS>
the
violence
of
my
intrusion

the
effect
of
necessity

<EOS>
in
cross
the

my
squire
and
his

and
with
some
difficulty
I
have
be
able
to
drag
him
ashore
,
though
I
be
afraid
my
assistance
reach
him
too
late
:
for

since

him
to

he

of

<EOS>
"
here
he
be
interrupt
by
a
groan
,
which
issue
from
the
chest
of
the
squire
,
and
terrify
the
spectator
as
much
as
it
comfort
the
master
.
<EOS>
after
some
recollection
,
Mr
Fillet
begin
to
undress
the
body
,
which
be
lay
in
a
blanket
on
the
floor
,
and
roll

by
his
direction
.
   
<EOS>
a
considerable
quantity
of
water
be
discharge
from
the
mouth
of
this
unfortunate
squire
,
he
utter
a
hideous
roar
,
and
,
open
his
eye
,
stare
wildly
around
:
then
the
surgeon
undertake
for
his
recovery
;
and
his
master
go
forth
with
the
ostler
in
quest
of
the
horse
,
which
he
have
leave
by
the
side
of
the

<EOS>
His

be
no

than
Ferret

who
have
be
peep
from
behind
the
pantry

door
,
venture
to
rejoin
the
company
;
pronounce
with
a
smile
,
or
rather
grin
of
contempt
,
"

<EOS>
certain
it
be

Dolly

at
that

in
the

;
and
Clarke
appear
soon
after
in
some
confusion
,
<EOS>
declare
she

but

"
   
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
the
surgeon
have
perform
the
operation
of
phlebotomy
on
the
squire
,
who
be
lift
into
a
chair
,
and
support
by
the
landlady
for
that
purpose
;
but
he
have
not
as
yet
give
any
sign
of
have
retrieve
the
use
of
his
sense
.
<EOS>
and
here
Mr
Fillet
could
not
help
contemplate
,
with
surprize
,
the
strange
figure
and
accoutrement
of
his
patient
,
who
seem
in
age
to
be
turn
of
fifty
.
<EOS>
His
stature
be
below
the
middle
size
:
he
be
thick
,
squat
,
and
brawny
,
with
a
small
protuberance
on
one
shoulder
,
and
a
prominent
belly
,
which
,
in
consequence
of
the
water
he
have
swallow
,
now
strut
beyond
its
usual
dimension
.
<EOS>
His
forehead
be
remarkably
convex
,
and
so
very
low
,
that
his
black
bushy
hair
descend
within
an
inch
of
his
nose
:
but
this
do
not
conceal
the
wrinkle
of
his
front
,
which
be
manifold
.
   
<EOS>
His
small
glimmering
eye
resemble
those
of
the
Hampshire
porker
,
that
turn
up
the
soil
with
his
projecting
snout
.
<EOS>
His
cheek
be
shrivel
and
pucker
at
the
corner
,
like
the
seam
of
a
regimental
coat
as
it
come
from
the
hand
of
the
contracter
:
his
nose
bear
a
strong
analogy
in
shape
to
a
tennis
-
ball
,
and
in
colour
to
a
mulberry
;
for
all
the
water
of
the
river
have
not
be
able
to
quench
the
natural
fire
of
that
feature
.
<EOS>
His
upper
jaw
be
furnish
with
two
long
white
sharp
point
tooth
or
fang
,
such
as
the
reader
may
have
observe
in
the
chap
of
a
wolf
,
or
full
-
grown
mastiff
,
and
an
anatomist
would
describe
as
a
preternatural
elongation
of
the
dentes
canini
.
<EOS>
His
chin
be
so
long
,
so
peaked
,
and
incurvate
,
as
to
form
in
profile
with
his
impending
forehead
the
exact
resemblance
of
a
moon
in
the
first
quarter
.
<EOS>
with
respect
to
his
equipage
,
he
have
a
leathern
cap
upon
his
head
,
face
like
those
wear
by
marine
,
and
exhibit
in
embroidery
the
figure
of
a
crescent
.
   
<EOS>
His
coat
be
of
white
cloth
face
with
black
,
and
cut
in
a
very
antique
fashion
;
and
,
in
lieu
of
a
waistcoat
,
he
wear
a
buff
jerkin
.
<EOS>
His
foot
be
case
with
loose
buskin
,
which
,
though
they
rise
almost
to
his
knee
,
could
not
hide
that
curvature
know
by
the
appellation
of
bandy
leg
.
<EOS>
a
large
string
of
bandalier
garnish
a
broad
belt
that
grace
his
shoulder
,
from
whence
depend
an
instrument
of
war
,
which
be
something
between
a
back
-
sword
and
a
cutlass
;
and
a
case
of
pistol
be
stick
in
his
girdle
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
figure
which
the
whole
company
now
survey
with
admiration
.
<EOS>
after
some
pause
,
he
seem
to
recover
his
recollection
.
<EOS>
He
roll
about
his
eye
around
,
and
,
attentively
survey
every
individual
,
exclaim
,
in
a
strange
tone
,
"
Bodikins
!
<EOS>
where
be
gilbert
?
<EOS>
"
this
interrogation
do
not
savour
much
of
sanity
,
especially
when
accompany
with
a
wild
stare
,
which
be
generally
interpret
as
a
sure
sign
of
a
disturbed
understanding
:
nevertheless
,
the
surgeon
endeavour
to
assist
his
recollection

here
the
Captain
interposing

"
what

the
patient
)
that
the
only
way
to

my

It

aquiline

be

do
purpose

at
once
into
the
current
of
narration
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
before
,
gemmen
,
that
the
gentleman
in
armour
be
the
only
son
of
Sir
Everhard
Greaves
,
who
possess
a
free
estate
of
five
thousand
a
year
in
our
county
,
and
be
respect
by
all
his
neighbour
,
as
much
for
his
personal
merit
as
for
his
family
fortune
.
   
<EOS>
with
respect
to
his
son
Launcelot
,
whom
you
have
see
,
I
can
remember
nothing
until
he
return
from
the
university
,
about
the
age
of
seventeen
,
and
then
I
myself
be
not
more
than
ten
year
old
.
<EOS>
the
young
gemman
be
at
that
time
in
mourning
for
his
mother
;
though
God
he
know
,
Sir
Everhard
have
more
cause
to
rejoice
than
to
be
afflict
at
her
death
:
  
for
,
among
friend
,
(
here
he
lower
his
voice
,
and
look
round
the
kitchen
)
<EOS>
she
be
very
whimsical
,
expensive
,
and
ill
-
temper
,
and
,
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
,
a
little
 
upon
the
 
flighty
order
 
a
little
touched
or
so
;
 
but
mum
for
that
 
the
lady
be
now
dead
;
and
it
be
my
maxim
,
de
mortuis
nil
nisi
bonum
.
<EOS>
the
young
squire
be
even
then
very
handsome
,
and
look
remarkably
well
in
his
weeper
:
but
he
have
an
aukward
air
and
shambling
gait
,
stoop
mortally
,
and
be
so
shy
and
silent
,
that
he
would
not
look
a
stranger
in
the
face
,
nor
open
his
mouth
before
company
.
   
<EOS>
whenever
he
spy
a
horse
or
carriage
at
the
gate
,
he
would
make
his
escape
into
the
garden
,
and
from
thence
into
the
park
;
where
many
be
the
good
time
and
often
he
have
be
find
sit
under
a
tree
,
with
a
book
in
his
hand
,
read
Greek
,
Latin
,
and
other
foreign
linguas
.
   
<EOS>
Sir
Everhard
himself
be
no
great
scholar
,
and
my
father
have
forget
his
classical
learning
;
and
so
the
rector
of
the
parish
be
desire
to
examine
young
Launcelot
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
time
before
he
find
an
opportunity
:
the
squire
always
give
him
the
slip
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
the
parson
catch
him
in
bed
of
a
morning
,
and
,
lock
the
door
,
to
it
they
go
tooth
and
nail
.
<EOS>
what
pass
betwixt
them
<EOS>
the
Lord
in
heaven
know
;
<EOS>
but
,
when
the
Doctor
come
forth
,
he
look
wild
and
haggard
as
if
he
have
see
a
ghost
,
his
face
as
white
as
paper
,
and
his
lip
tremble
like
an
aspen

leaf
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Parson
,
(
say
the
knight
)
<EOS>
what
be
the
matter
?
  
<EOS>
how
do'st
find
my
son
?
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
not
turn
out
a
ninny
,
and
disgrace
his
family
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
Doctor
,
wipe
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
,
reply
,
with
some
hesitation
,
"
he
could
not
tell
 
he
hope
the
good
  
<EOS>
the
squire
be
to
be
sure
a
very
extraordinary
young
gentleman
"
  
<EOS>
but
the
father
urge
him
to
give
an
explicit
answer
,
he
frankly
declare
,
that
,
in
his
opinion
,
the
son
would
turn
out
either
a
mirrour
of
wisdom
,
or
a
monument
of
folly
:
for
his
genius
and
disposition
be
altogether
preternatural
.
<EOS>
the
knight
be
sorely
vexed
at
this
declaration
,
and
signify
his
displeasure
by
say
,
the
doctor
,
like
a
true
priest
,
deal
in
mystery
and
oracle
,
that
would
admit
of
different
and
indeed
contrary
interpretation
.
<EOS>
He
afterwards
consult
my
father
,
who
have
serve
as
steward
upon
the
estate
for
above
thirty
year
,
and
acquire
a
considerable
share
of
his
favour
.
"
<EOS>
Will
Clarke
,
(
say
he
,
with
tear
in
his
eye
)
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
with
this
unfortunate
lad
?
<EOS>
I
would
to
God
<EOS>
he
have
never
be
bear
;
for
I
fear
he
will
bring
my
grey
hair
with
sorrow
to
the
grave
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
be
go
,
he
will
throw
away
the
estate
,
and
bring
himself
to
infamy
and
ruin
by
keep
company
with
rook
and
beggar
.
  
<EOS>
o
Will
!
<EOS>
I
could
forgive
extravagance
in
a
young
man
;
but
it
break
my
heart
to
see
my
only
son
give
such
repeated
proof
of
a
mean
spirit
and
sordid
disposition
!
"
   
<EOS>
here
the
old
gentleman
shed
a
flood
of
tear
,
and
not
without
some
shadow
of
reason
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
Launcelot
be
grow
so
reserved
to
his
father
,
that
he
seldom
see
him
,
or
any
of
his
relation
,
except
when
he
be
in
a
manner
force
to
appear
at
table
,
and
there
his
bashfulness
seem
every
day
to
encrease
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
he
have
form
some
very
strange
connexion
.
   
<EOS>
every
morning
he
visit
the
stable
,
where
he
not
only
converse
with
the
groom
and
helper
,
but
scrape
acquaintance
with
the
horse
:
he
feed
his
favourite
with
his
own
hand
,
stroake
,
caress
,
and
ride
them
by
turn
;
till
at
last
they
grow
so
familiar
,
that
,
even
when
they
be
a
-
field
at
grass
,
and
see
him
at
a
distance
,
they
would
toss
their
mane
,
whinny
like
so
many
colt
at
sight
of
the
dam
,
and
,
gallop
up
to
the
place
where
he
stand
,
smell
him
all
over
.
  
<EOS>
You
must
know
that
I
myself
,
though
a
child
,
be
his
companion
in
all
these
excursion
.
<EOS>
He
take
a
liking
to
me
on
account
of
my
be
his
godson
,
and
give
me
more
money
than
I
know
what
to
do
with
:
he
have
always
plenty
of
cash
for
the
asking
,
as
my
father
be
order
to
supply
him
liberally
,
the
knight
think
that
a
command
of
money
may
help
to
raise
his
thought
to
a
proper
consideration
of
his
own
importance
.
<EOS>
He
never
could
endure
a
common
beggar
,
that
be
not
either
in
a
state
of
infancy
or
of
old
age
:
but
,
in
other
respect
,
he
make
the
guinea
fly
in
such
a
manner
,
as
look
more
like
madness
than
generosity
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
no
communication
with
your
rich
yeoman
;
but
rather
treat
them
and
their
family
with
studied
contempt
,
because
forsooth
they
pretend
to
assume
the
dress
and
manner
of
the

<EOS>
I
have
hear
Mr
Greaves
ridicule
them
for
their
vanity
and
aukward
imitation
;
and
therefore
,
I
believe
,
he
avoid
all
concern
with
them
,
even
when
they
endeavour
to
engage
his
attention
.
<EOS>
It
be
the

He

a

industriously

of

He

their

cloathe
their

fill
their

and
supply
them
with
necessary

exercise
their

different

I

give
you
one

to
dance
before
squire
Launcelot

as
he
make
his

Lord
help

he
could
not
rest
if
he

there
be
an
ache
heart
in
the
whole
parish

<EOS>
every
paultry
cottage
be
in
a
little
time
convert
into
a
pretty
snug
,
comfortable
habitation

with
a
wooden
porch
at
the
door

glass
casement
in
the
window

and
a
little
garden
behind
well
store
with
green

root
,
and
sallad

<EOS>
in
a
word
,
the
poor
's
rate
be
reduce
to
a
meer
trifle
,
and
one
would
have
think
the
golden
age
be
revive
in
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
tell
you
before
,
the
old
knight
could
not
bear
to
see
his
only
son
so
wholly
attach
to
these
lowly
pleasure
,
while
he
industriously
shun
all
opportunity
of
appear
in
that
superior
sphere
to
which
he
be
design
by
nature
and
by
fortune
.
<EOS>
He
impute
his
conduct
to
meanness
of
spirit
,
and
advise
with
my
father
touch
the
proper
expedient
to
wean
his
affection
from
such
low
-
bear
pursuit
.
<EOS>
My
father
counsel
him
to
send
the
young
gentleman
up
to
London
,
to
be
enter
as
a
student
in
the
Temple
,
and
recommend
to
the
superintendance
of
some
person
who
know
the
town
,
and
may
engage
him
insensibly
in
such
amusement
and
connexion
,
as
would
soon
lift
his
idea
above
the
humble
object
on
which
they
have
be
hitherto
employ
.
<EOS>
this
advice
appear
so
salutary
,
that
it
be
follow
without
the
least
hesitation
.
   
<EOS>
the
young
squire
himself
be
perfectly
well
satisfied
with
the
proposal
,
and
in
a
few
day
set
out
for
the
great
city
:
but
there
be
not
a
dry
eye
in
the
parish
at
his
departure
,
although
he
prevail
upon
his
father
to
pay
in
his
absence
all
the
pension
he
have
grant
to
those
who
could
not
live
on
the
fruit
of
their
own
industry
.
<EOS>
in
what
manner
he
spend
his
time
at
London
,
it
be
none
of
my
business
to
inquire
;
those
I
know
pretty
well
<EOS>
what
kind
of
life
be
lead
by
gemman
of
your
Inns
of
Court
.
  
<EOS>
I
myself
once
belong
to
Serjeant
's
Inn
,
and
be
perhaps
as
good
a
wit
and
a
critick
as
any
Templar
of
them
all
.
<EOS>
nay
,
as
for
that
matter
,
those
I
despise
vanity
,
I
can
aver
with
a
safe
conscience
,
that
I
have
once
the
honour
to
belong
to
the
society
call
the
Town
:
<EOS>
we
be
all
of
us
attorney
clerk
,
gemman
,
and
have
our
meeting
at
an
ale
-
house
in
Butcherrow
,
where
we
regulate
the
diversion
of
the
theatre
.
   
<EOS>
but
to
return
from
this
digression
:
Sir
Everhard
Greaves
do
not
seem
to
be
very
well
pleased
with
the
conduct
of
his
son
at
London
.
<EOS>
He
get
notice
of
some
irregularity
and
scrape
into
which
he
have
fall
;
and
the
squire
seldom
write
to
his
father
,
except
to
draw
upon
him
for
money
,
which
he
do
so
fast
,
that
in
eighteen
month
the
old
gemman
lose
all
patience
.
   
<EOS>
at
this
period
squire
Darnel
chance
to
die
,
leave
an
only
daughter
,
a
minor
,
heiress
of
three
thousand
a
year
,
under
the
guardianship
of
her
uncle
Anthony
,
whose
brutal
character
all
the
world
know
.
<EOS>
the
breath
be
no
sooner
out
of
his
brother
's
body
than
he
resolve
,
if
possible
,
to
succeed
him
in
parliament
as
representative
for
the
borough
of
Ashenton
.
   
<EOS>
now
you
must
know
,
that
this
borough
have
be
for
many
year
a
bone
of
contention
between
the
family
of
Greaves
and
Darnel
;
and
at
length
the
difference
be
compromise
by
the
interposition
of
friend
,
on
condition
that
Sir
Everhard
and
Squire
Darnel
should
alternately
represent
the
place
in
parliament
.
<EOS>
They
agree
to
this
compromise
for
their
mutual
convenience
;
but
they
be
never
heartily
reconcile
.
<EOS>
Their
political
principle
do
not
tally
;
and
their
wife
look
upon
each
other
as
rival
in
fortune
and
magnificence
:
so
that
there
be
no
intercourse
between
them
,
thof
they
live
in
the
same
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
in
all
dispute
,
they
constantly
head
the
opposite
party
.
<EOS>
Sir
Everhard
understand
that
Anthony
Darnel
have
begin
to
canvass
,
and
be
put
every
iron
in
the
fire
,
in
violation
and
contempt
of
the
pactum
familiae
before
mention
,
fall
into
a
violent
passion
,
that
bring
on
a
severe
fit
of
the
gout
,
by
which
he
be
disabled
from
give
personal
attention
to
his
own
interest
.
<EOS>
My
father
,
indeed
,
employ
all
his
diligence
and
address
,
and
spare
neither
money
,
time
,
nor
constitution
,
till
at
length
he
drink
himself
into
a
consumption
,
which
be
the
death
of
him
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
after
all
,
there
be
a
great
difference
between
a
steward
and
a
principal
.
<EOS>
Mr
Darnel
attend
in
propria
persona
,
flatter
and
caress
the
woman
,
feast
the
elector
,
hire
mob
,
make
procession
,
and
scatter
about
his
money
in
such
a
manner
,
that
our
friend
durst
hardly
shew
their
head
in
public
.
   
<EOS>
at
this
very
crisis
our
young
squire
,
to
whom
his
father
have
writ
an
account
of
the
transaction
,
arrive
unexpectedly
at
Greavesbury
-
hall
,
and
have
a
long
private
conference
with
Sir
Everhard
.
<EOS>
the
news
of
his
return
spread
like
wild
-
fire
thro
'
all
that
part
of
the
country
:
bonfire
be
make
,
and
the
bell
set
a
ringing
in
several
town
and
steeple
;
and
next
morning
above
seven
hundred
people
be
assemble
at
the
gate
,
with
music
,
flag
and
streamer
,
to
welcome
their
young
squire
,
and
accompany
him
to
the
borough
of
Ashenton
.
<EOS>
He
set
out
on
foot
with
this
retinue
,
and
enter
one
end
of
the
town
just
as
Mr
Darnel
's
mob
have
come
in
at
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
both
arrive
about
the
same
time
at
the
market
-
place
;
but
Mr
Darnel
,
mount
first
into
the
balcony
of
the
town
-
house
,
make
a
long
speech
to
the
people
in
favour
of
his
own
pretension
,
not
without
some
invidious
reflection
glance
at
Sir
Everhard
,
his
competitor
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
much
mind
the
acclamation
of
his
party
,
which
we
know
have
be
hire
for
the
purpose
:
but
we
be
in
some
pain
for
Mr
Greaves
,
who
have
not
be
use
to
speak
in
public
.
<EOS>
He
take
his
turn
however
in
the
balcony
,
and
,
uncover
his
head
,
bow
all
round
with
the
most
engaging
courtesy
.
<EOS>
He
be
dress
in
a
green
frock
trim
with
gold
,
and
his
own
dark
hair
flow
about
his
ear
in
natural
curl
,
while
his
face
be
overspread
with
a
blush
,
that
improve
the
glow
of
youth
to
a
deep
crimson
,
and
I
dare
say
set
many
a
female
heart
a
palpitating
.
   
<EOS>
when
he
make
his
first
appearance
,
there
be
just
such
a
humming
and
clapping
of
hand
as
you
may
have
hear
when
the
celebrated
Garrick
come
upon
the
stage
in
King
Lear
,
or
King
Richard
,
or
any
other
top
character
.
<EOS>
but
how
agreeably
be
we
disappointed
,
when
our
young
gentleman
make
such
an
oration
as
would
not
have
disgrace
a
Pitt
,
an
Egmont
,
or
a
Murray
!
<EOS>
while
he
speak
,
all
be
hush
in
admiration
and
attention
 
<EOS>
you
could
have
almost
hear
a
feather
drop
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
charm
you
to
hear
with
what
modesty
he
recount
the
service
which
his
father
and
grandfather
have
do
to
the
corporation
;
with
what
eloquence
he
expatiate
upon
the
shameful
infraction
of
the
treaty
subsist
between
the
two
family
;
and
with
what
keen
and
spirit
stroke
of
satire
he
retort
the
sarcasm
of
Darnel
.
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
conclude
his
harangue
,
than
there
be
such
a
burst
of
applause
as
seem
to
rend
the
very
sky
.
   
<EOS>
Our
musick
immediately
strike
up
;
our
people
advance
with
their
ensign
,
and
,
as
every
man
have
a
good
cudgel
,
broken
head
would
have
ensue
,
have
not
Mr
Darnel
and
his
party
think
proper
to
retreat
with
uncommon
dispatch
.
<EOS>
He
never
offer
to
make
another
public
entrance
,
as
he
see
the
torrent
run
so
violently
against
him
;
but
sit
down
with
his
loss
,
and
withdraw
his
opposition
,
though
at
bottom
extremely
mortified
and
incensed
.
<EOS>
Sir
Everhard
be
unanimously
elect
,
and
appear
to
be
the
happy
man
upon
earth
;
for
,
besides
the
pleasure
arise
from
his
victory
over
this
competitor
,
he
be
now
fully
satisfied
that
his
son
,
instead
of
disgrace
,
would
do
honour
to
his
family
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
move
a
heart
of
stone
,
to
see
with
what
a
tender
transport
of
paternal
joy
he
receive
his
dear
Launcelot
,
after
have
hear
of
his
deportment
and
success
at
Ashenton
;
where
,
by
the
bye
,
he
give
a
ball
to
the
lady
,
and
display
as
much
elegance
and
politeness
as
if
he
have
be
breed
at
the
court
of
Versailles
.
   
<EOS>
this
joyous
season
be
of
short
duration
:
in
a
little
time
all
the
happiness
of
the
family
be
overcast
by
a
sad
incident
,
which
hath
leave
such
an
unfortunate
impression
upon
the
mind
of
the
young
gentleman
,
as
,
I
be
afraid
,
will
never
be
efface
.
<EOS>
Mr
Darnel
's
niece
and
ward
,
the
great
heiress
,
whose
name
be
Aurelia
,
be
the
most
celebrated
beauty
of
the
whole
country
 
if
I
say
the
whole
kingdom
,
or
indeed
all
Europe
,
perhaps
I
should
barely
do
her
justice
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
to
be
a
limner
,
gemman
;
nor
do
it
become
me
to
delineate
such
excellence
:
<EOS>
but
surely
I
may
presume
to
repeat
from
the
play
;
   
"
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
she
be
all
that
painting
can
express
,
"
or
youthful
poet
fancy
when
they
love
!
   
<EOS>
at
that
time
she
may
be
about
seventeen
,
tall
and
fair
,
and
so
exquisitely
shaped
 
<EOS>
you
may
talk
of
your
Venus
de
Medicis
,
your
Dianas
,
your
Nymphs
,
and
Galateas
;
but
if
Praxiteles
,
and
Roubillac
,
and
Wilton
,
be
to
lay
their
head
together
,
in
order
to
make
a
complete
pattern
of
beauty
,
they
would
hardly
reach
her
model
of
perfection
.
   
<EOS>
as
for
complexion
,
poet
will
talk
of
blend
the
lily
with
the
rose
,
and
bring
in
a
parcel
of
simile
of
cowslip
,
carnation
,
pink
,
and
daisy
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
dolly
,
now
,
have
get
a
very
good
complexion
:
 
indeed
,
she
be
the
very
picture
of
health
and
innocence
.
  
<EOS>
You
be
,
indeed
,
my
pretty
lass
;
 
but
parva
componere
magnis
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Darnel
be
all
amazing
beauty
,
delicacy
,
and
dignity
!
<EOS>
then
the
softness
and
expression
of
her
fine
blue
eye
;
her
pouting
lip
of
coral
hue
;
her
neck
,
that
rise
like
a
tower
of
polished
alabaster
between
two
mount
of
snow
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
,
gemman
,
it
do
not
signify
talk
:
if
e'er
<EOS>
a
one
of
you
be
to
meet
this
young
lady
alone
,
in
the
midst
of
a
heath
or
common
,
or
any
unfrequented
place
,
he
would
down
on
his
knee
,
and
think
he
kneel
before
some
supernatural
being
.
   
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
more
<EOS>
:
she
not
only
resemble
an
angel
in
beauty
,
but
a
saint
in
goodness
,
and
an
hermit
in
humility
;
  
<EOS>
so
void
of
all
pride
and
affectation
;
so
soft
,
and
sweet
,
and
affable
,
and
humane
!
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
I
could
tell
such
instance
of
her
charity
!
   
<EOS>
sure
enough
,
she
and
Sir
Launcelot
be
form
by
nature
for
each
other
:
howsoever
,
the
cruel
hand
of
fortune
hath
intervene
,
and
sever
them
for
ever
.
<EOS>
every
soul
that
know
them
both
,
say
it
be
a
thousand
pity
<EOS>
but
they
should
come
together
,
and
extinguish
in
their
happy
union
the
mutual
animosity
of
the
two
family
,
which
have
so
often
embroil
the
whole
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
nothing
be
hear
but
the
praise
of
miss
Aurelia
Darnel
and
Mr
Launcelot
Greaves
;
and
no
doubt
the
party
be
prepossess
,
by
this
applause
,
in
favour
of
each
other
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
,
Mr
Greaves
go
one
Sunday
to
her
parish
-
church
;
but
,
though
the
great
part
of
the
congregation
watch
their
look
,
they
could
not
perceive
that
she
take
least
notice
of
him
;
or
that
he
seem
to
be
strike
with
her
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
afterwards
have
an
opportunity
of
see
her
,
more
at
leisure
,
at
the
York
-
assembly
,
during
the
race
;
but
this
opportunity
be
productive
of
no
good
effect
,
because
he
have
that
same
day
quarrel
with
her
uncle
on
the
turf
.
  
<EOS>
an
old
grudge
,
you
know
,
gemmen
,
be
soon
inflame
to
a
fresh
rupture
.
<EOS>
It
be
think
Mr
Darnel
come
on
purpose
to
shew
his
resentment
.
<EOS>
They
differ
about
a
bet
upon
Miss
Cleverlegs
,
and
,
in
the
course
of
the
dispute
,
Mr
Darnel
call
him
a
petulant
boy
.
<EOS>
the
young
squire
,
who
be
as
hasty
as
gunpowder
,
tell
him
he
be
man
enough
to
chastise
him
for
his
insolence
;
and
would
do
it
on
the
spot
,
if
he
think
it
would
not
interrupt
the
diversion
.
   
<EOS>
in
all
probability
they
would
have
come
to
point
immediately
,
have
not
the
gentleman
interpose
;
so
that
nothing
further
pass
,
but
abundance
of
foul
language
on
the
part
of
Mr
Anthony
,
and
a
repeat
defiance
to
single
combat
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Greaves
,
make
a
low
bow
,
retire
from
the
field
;
and
in
the
evening
dance
at
the
assembly
with
a
young
lady
from
the
Bishoprick
,
seemingly
in
good
temper
and
spirit
,
without
have
any
word
with
Mr
Darnel
,
who
be
also
present
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
morning
he
visit
that
proud
neighbour
betime
;
and
they
have
almost
reach
a
grove
of
tree
on
the
north
-
side
of
the
town
,
when
they
be
suddenly
overtake
by
half
a
dozen
gentleman
,
who
have
watch
their
motion
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
for
them
to
dissemble
their
design
,
which
could
not
now
take
effect
.
<EOS>
They
give
up
their
pistol
,
and
a
reconciliation
be
patch
up
by
the
press
remonstrance
of
their
common
friend
;
but
Mr
Darnel
's
hatred
still
rankle
at
bottom
,
and
soon
break
out
in
the
sequel
.
   
<EOS>
about
three
month
after
this
transaction
,
his
niece
Aurelia
,
with
her
mother
,
have
be
to
visit
a
lady
in
the
chariot
,
the
horse
be
young
,
and
not
use
to
the
trace
,
be
startle
at
the
braying
of
a
jack
-
ass
on
the
common
,
and
take
fright
,
run
away
with
the
carriage
like
lightning
.
<EOS>
the
coachman
be
throw
from
the
box
,
and
the
lady
scream
piteously
for
help
.
<EOS>
Mr
Greaves
chance
to
be
a
horse
-
back
on
the
other
side
of
an
inclosure
,
when
he
hear
their
shriek
;
and
ride
up
to
the
hedge
,
know
the
chariot
,
and
see
their
disaster
.
<EOS>
the
horse
be
then
run
full
speed
in
such
a
direction
,
as
to
drive
headlong
over
a
precipice
into
a
stone
-
quarry
,
where
they
and
the
chariot
,
and
the
lady
,
must
be
dash
in
piece
.
   
<EOS>
You
may
conceive
,
gemman
,
what
his
thought
be
when
he
see
such
a
fine
young
lady
,
in
the
flower
of
her
age
,
just
plunge
into
eternity
;
when
he
see
the
lovely
Aurelia
on
the
brink
of
be
precipitate
among
rock
,
where
her
delicate
limb
must
be
mangle
and
tear
asunder
;
when
he
perceive
that
,
before
he
could
ride
round
by
the
gate
,
the
tragedy
would
be
finish
.
<EOS>
the
fence
be
so
thick
and
high
,
flank
with
a
broad
ditch
on
the
outside
,
that
he
could
not
hope
to
clear
it
,
although
he
be
mount
on
Scipio
,
breed
out
of
Miss
Cowslip
,
the
sire
Muley
,
and
his
grandsire
the
famous
Arabian
Mustapha

<EOS>
Scipio

breed
by
my
father
,
who
would
not
have
take
a
hundred
guinea
for
him
from
any
other
person
but
the
young
squire
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
have
hear
my
poor
father
say
"
    
by
this
time
Ferret
's
impatience
be
become
so
outrageous
,
that
he
exclaim
in
a
furious
tone
,
"

<EOS>
"
I

that
Mr

mount
on
Scipio

when
he
see
miss
Darnel
and
her
mother
in
danger
of
be
hurry
over
a
precipice

<EOS>
without

a
moment
he
give
Scipio
the
spur
,

at
one
spring
he
clear
five
and
twenty
foot
,
over
hedge
and
ditch
,
and
every
obstruction
.
   
<EOS>
then
he
ride
full
speed
,
in
order
to
turn
the
coach

horse
;
and
,
find
them
quite
wild
and
furious
,
endeavour
to
drive
against
the
counter
of
the
hither
horse
,
which
he
miss
,
and
stake
poor
Scipio
on
the
pole
of
the
coach
.
<EOS>
the
shock
be
so
great
,
that
the
coach

horse
make
a
full
stop
within
ten
yard
of
the

Mr

throw
forwards

faint
away

what
be
his

<EOS>
the

be
not

Mr

be
so
much
transport
on

that
he
could
not

disclose
a

he
have
hitherto
industriously
conceal

what
I
have
do

be

a
common
office

humanity

I
would
have
perform
for
any
of
my

be
again
flush

her
eye
sparkle
with
pleasure

nor

the
youth

confession
disagreeable
to
the

at

glance
perceive
all
the
advantage

Mr

<EOS>
She
kindly
inquire
if

himself
sustain
any

<EOS>
She
entertain
him
with
a
small
collation

,
in
the
course
of
the
conversation

lament
the
animosity
which
have
so
long
divide
two

<EOS>
He

express
the
most
eager

just
as

on

he
be
meet
by
Anthony
Darnel

who
ride
up

of
surprize

resentment

salute
him

none

Mr
Darnel
ask
,
what
have

him

honour

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
so
I
shall
(
cry
the
uncle

;

perhaps
let
you
know
my
sentiment

the
matter

"
Hereafter
as
it
may
be

"
say
the
youth
;
who
,
turn
out
of
the
avenue
,
walk
home
,
and
make
his
father
acquaint
with
the
particular
of
this
adventure

<EOS>
"
the
old
gentleman
chid
him
for
his
rashness
;
but
seem
pleased
with
the
success
of
his
attempt
,
and
still
more
so
,
when
he
understand
his
sentiment
of
Aurelia

deportment
of
the
lady

<EOS>
"
next
day

with
a
fever

produce
by
the
agitation
of
her
spirit

which
every

become
more

he
immediately
set
out
with
the
messenger

introduce
him
in
the
dark

<EOS>
He
find
the
old

almost
exhausted

overwhelm
with
grief

her
lovely
hair

the
good

beckon
Mr

to
approach
,
and
direct
all
the
attendant
to
quit
the
room
,
except
a
favourite
maid
,
from
whom
I
learn
the
story
<EOS>
,
she
take
him
by
the
hand
,
and
fix
her
eye
upon
him
with
all
the
fondness
of
a
mother
,
shed
some
tear
,
in
silence
,
while
the
same
mark
of
sorrow
trickle
down
his
cheek

<EOS>
after
this
affect
pause

"
My

unable

contain
herself
longer

break
out
into
a
violent
passion

grief

aloud

patiently

thus
give
vent
to
her
anguish

calmly
intreate
her

to
Mr

I

a
fond
hope

see
you
allied

upon
you

"
<EOS>
no
sooner
have
she
pronounce
these
word
than
he
throw
himself
on
his
knee
before
the
young
lady
,
and
,
press
her
hand
to
his
lip
,
breathe
the
soft
expression
which
the
most
delicate
love
could
suggest
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
(
resume
the
mother
)
that
your
passion
be
mutually
sincere

I
should
die
satisfied

if
I

your
union

but
that
violent
man

my
brother

in

who
be
Aurelia

sole
guardian

will
thwart
her
wish
with
every
obstacle
that
brutal
resentment

implacable
malice
can
contrive

<EOS>
Mr
Greaves
,
I
have
long
admire
your
virtue

be
confident
that
I
can
depend
upon
your
honour

You

when
I

you
will
take
no

in
this
affair
without

concurrence
of
your

and
endeavour
,
by
all
fair
and
honourable
mean

to
vanquish
the
prejudice

obtain
the
consent

her
uncle

the
rest
we
must
leave
to
the
dispensation

Providence

<EOS>

the
squire
promise
,
in
the
most
solemn

fervent
manner
,
to
obey
all
her
injunction
,
as
the
last
dictate
of
a
parent
whom
he
should
never
cease
to
honour

<EOS>
then
she
favour
them
both
with
a
great
deal
of
salutary
advice
,
touch
their
conduct
before
and
after
marriage
;
and
present
him
with
a
ring
,
as
a
memorial
of
her
affection
:
at
the
same
time
he
pull
another
off
his
finger

make
a
tender
of
it
as
a
pledge
of
his
love
to
Aurelia

permit
to
receive
this
token

finally

take
a
last
farewel
of

good
matron

this
life

be
remove
to
the
house

a
relation

her
grief
have
like
to
have
prove
fatal

constitution

no
sooner
committed
to
the
earth

Mr
Greaves
,
mindful
of
her
exhortation

begin
to
take
measure
for
a
reconciliation
with
the
guardian

<EOS>
He
engage
several
gentleman
to
interpose
their
good
office
;
but
they
always
meet
with
the
most
mortifying
repulse
:
and
at
last
Anthony
Darnel
declare
,
that
his
hatred
to
the
house
of
Greaves
be
hereditary
,
habitual
,
and
unconquerable
.
   
<EOS>
He
swear
he
would
spend
his
heart
's
blood
to
perpetuate
the
quarrel
;
and
that
,
sooner
than
his
niece
should
match
with
young
Launcelot
,
he
would
sacrifice
her
with
his
own
hand

young
gentleman

his
prejudice
so
rancorous

invincible

any
further
advance

,
since
he
find
it
impossible
to
obtain
his
consent

resolve
to
cultivate
the
good
grace
of
Aurelia
,
and
we
would
her
in
despite
of
her
implacable
guardian
.
<EOS>
He
find
mean
to
establish
a
literary
correspondence
with
her
,
as
soon
as
her
grief
be
a
little
abated
;
and
even
to
effect
an
interview
,
after
her
return
to
her
own
house

he
soon
have
reason
to
repent
of
this
indulgence

the
uncle
entertain
spy
upon
the
young
lady
,
who
give
him
an
account
of
this
meeting
;
in
consequence
of
which
she
be
suddenly
hurried
to
some
distant
part
of
the
country

which
we
never
could
discover

It
be
then
we
think
Mr
Launcelot
a
little
disorder
in
his
brain
,
his
grief
be
so
wild
,
and
his
passion
so
impetuous
.
   
<EOS>
He
refuse
all
sustenance
,
neglect
his
person
,
renounce
his
amusement
,
ride
out
in
the
rain
,
sometimes
bare
head
,
stroll
about
the
field
all
night

become
so
peevish
,
that
none
of
the
domestick
durst
speak
to
him
,
without
the
hazard
of
broken
bone

<EOS>
have
play
these
prank
for
about
three
week
,
to
the
unspeakable
chagrin
of
his
father
,
and
the
astonishment
of
all
that
know
him

he
suddenly
grow
calm
,

his
good
humour
return
.
<EOS>
but
this
,
as
your
sea

fare
people
say

be
a
deceitful
calm

that
soon
usher
in
a
dreadful
storm

He
have
long
seek
an
opportunity

tamper
with
some
of
Mr

servant

could
inform
him

the
place
where
Aurelia

there
be
not
one
about

could
give
him
that
satisfaction

accompany
her

fruitless

but
throw
himself
in
the
way
of
the
uncle
,
upbraid
him
in
such
harsh
term
,
that
a
formal
challenge
ensue
.
<EOS>
They
agree
to
decide
their
difference
without
witness
;
and
one
morning
,
before
sun
-
rise
,
meet
on
that
very
common
where
Mr
Greaves
have
save
the
life
of
Aurelia
.
<EOS>
the
first
pistol
be
fire
on
each
side
without
any
effect
;
but
Mr
Darnel
's
second
wound
the
young
squire
in
the
flank
:
nevertheless
,
have
a
pistol
in
reserve
,
he
desire
his
antagonist
to
ask
his
life
.
<EOS>
the
other
,
instead
of
submit
,
draw
his
sword
;
and
Mr
Greaves
,
fire
his
piece
into
the
air
,
follow
his
example
.
<EOS>
the
contest
then
become
very
hot
,
tho
'
of
short
continuance
.
<EOS>
Darnel
be
disarm
at
the
first
onset
,
our
young
squire
give
him
back
the
sword
,
which
he
be
base
enough
to
use
a
second
time
against
his
conqueror
.
<EOS>
such
an
instance
of
repeat
ingratitude
and
brutal
ferocity
divest
Mr
Greaves
of
his
temper
and
forbearance
.
   
<EOS>
He
attack
Mr
Anthony
with
great
fury
,
and
at
the
first
longe
run
him
up
to
the
hilt
,
at
the
same
time
seize
with
his
left
hand
the
shell
of
his
enemy
's
sword
,
which
he
break
in
disdain
.
<EOS>
Mr
Darnel
have
fall
,
the
other
immediately
mount
his
horse
,
which
he
have
tie
to
a
tree
before
the
engagement
;
and
ride
full
speed
to
Ashenton
,
send
a
surgeon
to
Anthony
's
assistance
.
<EOS>
He
afterwards
ingenuously
confess
all
these
particular
to
his
father
,
who
be
overwhelmed
with
consternation
,
for
the
wound
of
Darnel
be
judge
mortal
;
and
as
no
person
have
see
the
particular
of
the
duel
,
Mr
Launcelot
may
have
be
convict
of
murder
.
   
<EOS>
"
on
these
consideration
,
before
a
warrant
could
be
serve
upon
him
,
the
old
knight
,
by
dint
of
the
most
eager
intreatie
,
accompany
with
mark
of
horror
and
despair
,
prevail
upon
his
son
to
withdraw
himself
from
the
kingdom
,
until
such
time
as
the
storm
should
be
overblow
.
   
<EOS>
have
his
heart
be
unengage
,
he
would
have
choose
to
travel
;
but
at
this
period
,
when
his
whole
soul
be
engross
and
so
violently
agitate
by
his
passion
for
Aurelia
,
nothing
but
the
fear
of
see
the
old
gentleman
run
distract
,
would
have
induce
him
to
desist
from
the
pursuit
of
that
young
lady
<EOS>
far
less
quit
the
kingdom
where
she
,
reside
.
<EOS>
well
then
,
gemmen
,
he
repair
to
Harwich
,
where
he
embark
for
Holland
,
from
whence
he
proceed
to
Brussels
,
where
he
procure
a
pass

port
from
the
french
king
,
by
virtue
of
which
he
travel
to
Marseilles
,
and
there
take
a
tartan
for
Genoa
.
<EOS>
the
first
letter
sir
Everhard
receive
from
him
be
date
at
Florence
.
<EOS>
mean
while
the
surgeon
's
prognostic
be
not
altogether
verify
.
<EOS>
Mr
Darnel
do
not
die
immediately
of
his
wound
;
but
he
linger
a
long
time
,
as
it
be
in
the
arm
of
death
,
and
even
partly
recover
:
yet
,
in
all
probability
,
he
will
never
be
wholly
restore
to
the
enjoyment
of
his
health
;
and
be
oblige
every
summer
to
attend
the
hot
well
at
Bristol
.
   
<EOS>
as
his
wound
begin
to
heal
,
his
hatred
to
Mr
Greaves
seem
to
revive
with
augment
violence
;
and
he
be
now
,
if
possible
,
more
than
ever
determine
against
all
reconciliation
.
<EOS>
Mr
Launcelot
,
after
have
endeavour
to
amuse
his
imagination
with
a
succession
of
curious
object
,
in
a
tour
of
Italy
,
take
up
his
residence
at
a
town
call
Pisa
,
and
there
fall
into
a
deep
melancholy
,
from
which
nothing
could
rouse
him
but
the
news
of
his
father
's
death
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
(
God
rest
his
soul
)
never
hold
up
his
head
after
the
departure
of
his
darling
Launcelot
;
and
the
dangerous
condition
of
Darnel
keep
up
his
apprehension
:
this
be
reinforce
by
the
obstinate
silence
of
the
youth
,
and
certain
account
of
his
disorder
mind
,
which
he
have
receive
from
some
of
those
person
who
take
pleasure
in
communicate
disagreeable
tiding
.
   
<EOS>
a
complication
of
all
these
grievance
,
co
-
operate
with
a
severe
fit
of
the
gout
and
gravel
,
produce
a
fever
,
which
in
a
few
day
bring
sir
Everhard
to
his
long
home
;
after
he
have
settle
his
affair
with
heaven
and
earth
,
and
make
his
peace
with
God
and
man
.
<EOS>
I
will
assure
you
,
gemmen
,
he
make
a
most
edifying
and
christian
end
:
<EOS>
he
die
regret
by
all
his
neighbour
except
Anthony
,
and
may
be
say
to
be
embalm
by
the
tear
of
the
poor
,
to
whom
he
be
always
a
bounteous
benefactor
.
   
<EOS>
"
when
the
son
,
now
sir
Launcelot
,
come
home
,
he
appear
so
meagre
,
wan
,
and
hollow
-
eyed
,
that
the
servant
hardly
know
their
young
master
.
<EOS>
His
first
care
be
to
take
possession
of
his
fortune
,
and
settle
account
with
the
steward
who
have
succeed
my
father

<EOS>
these
affair
be
discuss
,
he
spare
no
pain
to
get
intelligence
concern
miss
Darnel
;
and
soon
learn
more
of
that
young
lady
than
he
desire
to
know
;
for
it
be
become
the
common
talk
of
the
country
,
that
a
match
be
agree
upon
between
her
and
young
squire
Sycamore
,
a
gentleman
of
a
very
great
fortune
.
   
<EOS>
these
tiding
be
probably
confirm
under
her
own
hand
,
in
a
letter
which
she
write
to
sir
Launcelot
.
<EOS>
the
content
be
never
exactly
know
but
to
the
party
themselves
:
nevertheless
,
the
effect
be
too
visible
;
for
,
from
that
blessed
moment
,
he
speak
not
one
word
to
any
live
creature
for
the
space
of
three
day
:
but
be
see
sometimes
to
shed
a
flood
of
tear
,
and
sometimes
to
burst
out
into
a
fit
of
laughing
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
break
silence
,
and
seem
to
wake
from
his
disorder
.
<EOS>
He
become
more
fond
than
ever
of
the
exercise
of
ride
,
and
begin
to
amuse
himself
again
with
act
of
benevolence
.
<EOS>
one
instance
of
his
generosity
and
justice
deserve
to
be
record
in
brass
or
marble
:
you
must
know
,
gemmen
,
the
rector
of
the
parish
be
lately
dead
,
and
sir
Everhard
have
promise
the
presentation
to
another
clergyman
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
sir
Launcelot
chance
one
Sunday
to
ride
through
a
lane
,
perceive
a
horse
saddle
and
bridle
feeding
on
the
side
of
a
fence
;
and
cast
his
eye
around
,
beheld
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
an
object
lie
extend
on
the
ground
,
which
he
take
to
be
the
body
of
a
murder
traveller
.
<EOS>
He
forthwith
alight
;
and
,
leap
into
the
field
,
descry
a
man
at
full
length
wrap
in
a
great
coat
,
and
writhe
in
agony
.
<EOS>
approach
nearer
,
he
find
it
be
a
clergyman
,
in
his
gown
and
caffock
.
<EOS>
when
he
inquire
into
the
case
,
and
offer
his
assistance
,
the
stranger
rise
up
,
thank
him
for
his
courtesy
,
and
declare
that
he
be
now
very
well
.
<EOS>
the
knight
,
who
think
there
be
something
mysterious
in
this
incident
,
express
a
desire
to
know
the
cause
of
his
rolling
in
the
grass
in
that
manner
;
and
the
clergyman
,
who
know
his
person
,
make
no
scruple
in
gratify
his
curiosity
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
,
sir
,
say
he
,
I
serve
the
curacy
of
your
own
parish
,
for
which
the
late
incumbent
pay
me
twenty
pound
a
year
;
but
this
sum
be
scarce
sufficient
to
maintain
my
wife
and
child
,
who
be
five
in
number
,
I
agree
to
read
prayer
in
the
afternoon
at
another
church
about
four
mile
from
hence
;
and
for
this
additional
duty
I
receive
ten
pound
more
:
as
I
keep
a
horse
,
it
be
formerly
an
agreeable
exercise
rather
than
a
toil
;
but
of
late
year
I
have
be
afflict
with
a
rupture
,
for
which
I
consult
the
most
eminent
operator
in
the
kingdom
;
but
I
have
no
cause
to
rejoice
in
the
effect
of
their
advice
,
though
one
of
them
assure
me
I
be
completely
cure
.
<EOS>
the
malady
be
now
more
troublesome
than
ever
,
and
often
come
upon
me
so
violently
while
I
be
on
horseback
,
that
I
be
force
to
alight
,
and
lie
down
upon
the
ground
,
until
the
cause
of
the
disorder
can
for
the
time
be
reduce
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sir
Launcelot
not
only
condole
with
him
upon
his
misfortune
,
but
desire
him
to
throw
up
the
second
cure
,
and
he
would
pay
him
ten
pound
a
year
out
of
his
own
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
Your
generosity
confound
me
,
good
sir
:
(
cry
the
clergyman
)
and
yet
I
ought
not
to
be
surprised
at
any
instance
of
benevolence
in
sir
Launcelot
Greaves
;
but
I
will
check
the
fulness
of
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
shall
only
observe
,
that
your
good
intention
towards
me
can
hardly
take
effect
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
,
who
be
to
succeed
the
late
incumbent
,
have
give
me
notice
to
quit
the
premise
,
as
he
hath
provide
a
friend
of
his
own
for
the
curacy
.
"
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
(
cry
the
knight
)
<EOS>
do
he
mean
to
take
your
bread
from
you
,
without
assign
any
other
reason
?
"
<EOS>
"
surely
,
sir
,
reply
the
ecclesiastic
,
I
know
of
no
other
reason
.
<EOS>
I
hope
my
moral
be
irreproachable
,
and
that
I
have
do
my
duty
with
a
conscientious
regard
:
I
may
venture
an
appeal
to
the
parishioner
among
whom
I
have
live
these
seventeen
year
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
it
be
natural
for
every
man
to
favour
his
own
friend
in
preference
to
stranger
.
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
I
propose
to
try
my
fortune
in
the
great
city
;
and
I
doubt
not
but
providence
will
provide
for
me
and
my
little
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
to
this
declaration
Sir
Launcelot
make
no
reply
;
but
ride
home
set
on
foot
a
strict
enquiry
into
the
character
of
this
man
,
whose
name
be
Jenkins
.
<EOS>
He
find
that
he
be
a
reputed
scholar
,
equally
remarkable
for
his
modesty
and
good
life
;
that
he
visit
the
sick
,
assist
the
needy
,
compromised
dispute
among
his
neighbour
,
and
spend
his
time
in
such
a
manner
as
would
have
do
honour
to
any
christian
divine
.
<EOS>
thus
inform
,
the
knight
send
for
the
gentleman
to
whom
the
living
have
be
promise
,
and
accost
him
to
this
effect
:
"
Mr
Tootle
,
I
have
a
favour
to
ask
of
you
.
<EOS>
the
person
who
serve
the
cure
of
this
parish
,
be
a
man
of
good
character
,
belove
by
the
people
,
and
have
a
large
family
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
oblige
to
you
if
you
will
continue
him
in
the
curacy
.
<EOS>
"
the
other
tell
him
he
be
sorry
he
could
not
comply
with
his
request
,
be
that
he
have
already
promise
the
curacy
to
a
friend
of
his
own
.
"
<EOS>
"
no
matter
:
(
reply
Sir
Launcelot
)
since
I
have
not
interest
with
you
,
I
will
endeavour
to
provide
for
Mr
Jenkins
in
some
other
way
.
"
   
<EOS>
that
same
afternoon
he
walk
over
to
the
curate
's
house
,
and
tell
him
that
he
have
speak
in
his
behalf
to
Dr
Tootle
,
but
the
curacy
be
preengage
.
<EOS>
the
good
man
have
make
a
thousand
acknowledgment
for
the
trouble
his
honour
have
take
;
"
I
have
not
interest
sufficient
to
make
you
curate
,
(
say
the
knight
)
<EOS>
but
I
can
give
you
the
live
itself
,
and
that
you
shall
have
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
retire
;
leave
Mr
Jenkins
incapable
of
utter
one
syllable
,
so
powerfully
be
he
strike
with
this
unexpected
turn
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
the
presentation
be
immediately
make
out
;
and
in
a
few
day
Mr
Jenkins
be
put
in
possession
of
his
benefice
,
to
the
inexpressible
joy
of
the
congregation
.
<EOS>
hitherto
every
thing
go
right
,
and
every
unprejudiced
person
commend
the
knight
's
conduct
:
but
,
in
a
little
time
,
his
generosity
seem
to
overleap
the
bound
of
discretion
;
and
even
in
some
case
may
be
think
tend
to
a
breach
of
the
king
's
peace
.
   
<EOS>
for
example
,
he
compel
,
vi
&
armis
,
a
rich
farmer
's
son
to
marry
the
daughter
of
a
cottager
,
whom
the
young
fellow
have
debauch
.
<EOS>
indeed
it
seem
there
be
a
promise
of
marriage
in
the
case
,
though
it
could
not
be
legally
ascertain
.
<EOS>
the
wench
take
on
dismally
;
and
her
parent
have
recourse
to
Sir
Launcelot
,
who
,
send
for
the
delinquent
,
expostulate
with
him
severely
on
the
injury
he
have
do
the
young
woman
,
and
exhort
him
to
save
her
life
and
reputation
by
perform
his
promise
;
in
which
case
he
(
Sir
Launcelot
)
would
give
her
three
hundred
pound
to
her
portion
.
<EOS>
whether
the
farmer
think
there
be
something
interested
in
this
uncommon
offer
,
or
be
a
little
elevate
by
the
consciousness
of
his
father
's
wealth
;
he
reject
the
proposal
with
rustic
disdain
,
and
say
,
if
so
be
as
how
the
wench
would
swear
the
child
to
him
,
he
would
settle
it
with
the
parish
:
but
declare
,
that
no
squire
in
the
land
should
oblige
him
to
buckle
with
such
a
cracked
pitcher
.
<EOS>
this
resolution
,
however
,
he
could
not
maintain
:
for
,
in
less
than
two
hour
,
the
rector
of
the
parish
have
direction
to
publish
the
banns
,
and
the
ceremony
be
perform
in
due
course
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
though
we
know
not
precisely
the
nature
of
the
argument
that
be
use
with
the
farmer
,
we
may
conclude
they
be
of
the
minatory
specie
;
for
the
young
fellow
could
not
,
for
some
time
,
look
any
person
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
the
knight
act
as
the
general
redresser
of
grievance
.
<EOS>
if
a
woman
complain
to
him
of
be
ill
treat
by
her
husband
,
he
first
inquire
into
the
foundation
of
the
complaint
;
and
if
he
find
it
just
,
catechise
the
defendant
.
<EOS>
if
the
warning
have
no
effect
,
and
the
man
proceed
to
fresh
act
of
violence
;
then
his
judge
take
the
execution
of
the
law
in
his
own
hand
,
and
horsewhip
the
party
.
<EOS>
thus
he
involve
himself
in
several

Tom

contemptuous
,

have
just
open
his

to
proceed
,
when
the
company
be
disturb
by
a
hideous
repetition
of
groans
,
that
seem
to
issue
from
the
chamber

the

snatch
the
candle
,

into

room

follow
by
the
doctor

the
rest

and
this
accident
naturally
suspend
the
narration
.
<EOS>
in
like
manner
we
shall
conclude
the
chapter

that
the

may
have
time
to

<EOS>
chapter
IV
in

this
recapitulation
draw
to
a
close

<EOS>
when
the
landlady
enter
the
room
from
whence
the
groaning
proceed
,
she
find
the
squire
lie
on
his
back
under
the
dominion
of
the
night
-
mare
,
which
ride
him
so
hard
,
that
he
not
only
groan
and
snort
,
but
the
sweat
run
down
his
face
in
stream
.
<EOS>
the
perturbation
of
his
brain
,
occasion
by
this
pressure
,
and
the
fright
he
have
lately
undergo
,
give
rise
to
a
very
terrible
dream
,
in
which
he
fancy
himself
apprehend
for
a
robbery
.
<EOS>
the
horror
of
the
gallow
be
strong
upon
him
,
when
he
be
suddenly
awake
by
a
violent
shock
from
the
doctor
;
and
the
company
break
in
upon
his
view
,
still
pervert
by
fear
,
and
bedim
by
slumber
.
<EOS>
His
dream
be
now
realize
by
a
full
persuasion
that
he
be
surround
by
the
constable
and
his
gang
.
   
<EOS>
the
first
object
that
present
itself
to
his
disordered
view
be
the
figure
of
Ferret
,
who
may
very
well
have
pass
for
the
finisher
of
the
law
:
against
him
therefore
the
first
effort
of
his
despair
be
direct
.
<EOS>
He
start
upon
the
floor
;
and
seize
a
certain
utensil
,
that
shall
be
nameless
,
launch
it
at
the
misanthrope
with
such
violence
,
that
,
have
he
not
cautiously
slip
his
head
aside
,
it
be
suppose
that
actual
fire
would
have
be
produce
from
the
collision
of
two
such
hard
and
solid
substance

<EOS>
all
future
mischief
be
prevent
by
the
strength
and
agility
of
captain
Crowe

who
,
spring
upon
the
assailant

pinion
his
arm
to
his
side

an

for

they
be
carry
me
to
Newgate
;

that
there
be
Jack

me
before

Ferret
,
who
be
the
person
he
have
thus
distinguish
,
eye
him
with
a
look
of
the
most
emphatic
malevolence
,
tell
him
,
it
be
very
natural
for
a
knave
to
dream
of
Newgate
;
and
that
he
hope
to
see
the
day
when
this
dream
would
be
find
a
true
prophecy
,
and
the
commonwealth
purge
of
all
such
rogue
and
vagabond
:
but
it
could
not
be
expect
that
the
vulgar
would
be
honest
and
conscientious
,
while
the
great
be
distinguish
by
profligacy
and
corruption
.
<EOS>
the
squire
be
dispose
to
make
a
practical
reply
to
this
insinuation
,
when
Mr
Ferret
prudently
withdraw
himself
from
the
scene
of
altercation
.
<EOS>
the
good
woman
of
the
house
persuade
his
antagonist
to
take
out
his
nap

assure
him
that
the
egg
and
bacon
,
with
a
mug
of
excellent
ale
,
should
be
forthcoming
in
due
season

<EOS>
the
affair
be
thus
fortunately
adjust
,
the
guest
return
to
the
kitchen

and
Mr

resume
his
story
to
this
effect

round

outside

a
book
for
some
time

we

to
be
the
constitution

knight

then
we
hear
a
loud
slap
which
ecchoe
through
the
whole
chapel

the
strange
pronounce
with
an
audible
and
solemn
voice
,
"

St

fortunate

gemmen

what
an
effect
this
strange
ceremony
have
upon
the
people
who
be
assemble

<EOS>
They
gaze
at
one
another
in
silent
horror
;

,
when
Sir
Launcelot
come
forth
completely
arm
,
take
to
their
heel
in
a
body
,
and
flee
with
the
utmost
precipitation

<EOS>
I
myself
be
overturn
in
the
crowd
;
and
this
be
the
case
with
that
very
individual
person
who
now
serve
him
as
a
squire

<EOS>
He
be
so
frightened
that
he
could
not
rise
,
but
lie
roar
in
such
a
manner

that
the
knight
come
up
,
and
give
him
a
thwack
with
his
launce
across
the
shoulder
,
which
rouse
him
with
a
vengeance
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
freely
own
I
be
not
altogether
unmoved
at
see
such
a
figure
come
stalk
out
of
a
church
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
;
for
it
recall
to
my
remembrance
the
idea
of
the
ghost
in
Hamlet
,
which
I
have
see
act
in
Drury
-
lane
,
when
I
make
my
first
trip
to
London
;
and
I
have
not
yet
get
rid
of
the
impression
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
Launcelot
,
attend
by
the
other
knight
,
proceed
to
the
stable
;
from
whence
,
with
his
own
hand
,
he
draw
forth
one
of
his
good
horse
,
a
fine
mettlesome
sorrel
,
who
have
get
blood
in
him
,
ornament
with
rich
trapping

<EOS>
in
a
trice
the
two
knight
,
and
the
other
two
stranger
,
who
now
appear
to
be
trumpeter
,
be
mount
.
<EOS>
Sir
Launcelot
's
armour
be
lacquer
black
;
and
on
his
shield
be
represent
the
moon
in
her
first
quarter
,
with
the
motto
impleat

<EOS>
the
trumpet
have
sound
a
charge
,
the
stranger
pronounce
with
a
loud
voice
,
"
God
preserve
this
gallant
knight
in
all
his
honourable
atchievement
;
and
may
he
long
continue
to
press
the
side
of
his
now
adopt
steed
,
which
I
denominate
Bronzomarte
,
hope
that
he
will
rival
in
swiftness
and
spirit
Bayardo
,
Brigliadoro
,
or
any
other
steed
of
past
or
present
chivalry
?
<EOS>
after
another
flourish
of
the
trumpet
,
all
four
clap
spur
to
their
horse
,
Sir
Launcelot
couch
his
launce
,
and
gallop
to
and
fro
,
as
if
they
have
be
mad
,
to
the
terror
and
astonishment
of
all
the
spectator
.
   
<EOS>
what
should
have
induce
our
knight
to
choose
this
here
man
for
his
squire
,
be
not
easy
to
determine
;
for
,
of
all
the
servant
about
the
house
,
he
be
the
least
likely
either
to
please
his
master
,
or
engage
in
such
an
undertaking
.
<EOS>
His
name
be
Timothy
Crabshaw
,
and
he
act
in
the
capacity
of
whipper
-
in
to
Sir
Everhard
.
<EOS>
He
afterwards
marry
the
daughter
of
a
poor
cottager
,
by
whom
he
have
several
child
,
and
be
employ
about
the
house
as
a
ploughman
and
carter
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
the
fellow
have
a
dry
sort
of
humour
about
him
:
but
he
be
universally
hate
among
the
servant
for
his
abusive
tongue
and
perverse
disposition
,
which
often
bring
him
into
trouble
;
for
though
the
fellow
be
as
strong
as
an
elephant
<EOS>
,
he
have
no
more
courage
naturally
than
a
chicken
 
<EOS>
I
say
naturally
,
because
,
since
his
be
a
member
of
knight
-
errantry
,
he
have
do
some
thing
that
appear
altogether
incredible
and
praeternatural
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Timothy
keep
such
a
bawling
,
after
he
have
receive
the
blow
from
Sir
Launcelot
,
that
every
body
on
the
field
think
some
of
his
bone
be
break
;
and
his
wife
,
with
five
bantling
,
come
snivel
to
the
knight
,
who
order
her
to
send
the
husband
directly
to
his
house
.
<EOS>
Tim
accordingly
go
thither
,
groan
piteously
all
the
way
,
creep
along
with
his
body
bent
like
a
Greenland
canoe
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
enter
the
court
,
the
outward
door
be
shut
;
and
Sir
Launcelot
come
down
stair
with
a
horsewhip
in
his
hand
,
ask
what
be
the
matter
with
him
that
he
complain
so
dismally
?
<EOS>
to
this
question
he
reply
,
that
it
be
as
common
as
duck
-
weed
in
his
country
,
for
a
man
to
complain
when
his
bone
be
broke
.
"
<EOS>
"
what
should
have
break
your
bone
?
"
say
the
knight
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
guess
,
(
answer
the
other
)
unless
it
be
that
delicate
switch
that
your
honour
in
your
mad
prank
handle
so
dextrously
upon
my
carcase
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Launcelot
then
tell
him
,
there
be
nothing
so
good
for
a
bruise
as
a
sweat
,
and
he
have
the
remedy
in
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
Timothy
eye
the
horsewhip
askance
<EOS>
,
observe
that
there
be
another
still
more
speedy
;
to

ascend
the
back
of
a
clumsy
cart

Gilbert

<EOS>
this

be
look
upon

of

Gilbert
be
the
most
stubborn

vicious

often
like

have
do
a
mischief
to
Timothy
while

He
once
thrust
Crabshaw
into
the
middle
of
a
quickset

hedge

where

be
terribly
torn

another
time
he

him
over
his

where
he
stick
with

up
,

must
have
perish
if

that
way

aloud

up

at

pace

instead

disastrous

exhort
his
adversary
to
punish
him
severely
for
his
insolence

they

obey
this
injunction

Crabshaw
find

in

club

lay
about
him
with
great
fury

wheel
about

who
be

have
receive
some
of
the
favour
intend
for
his
rider

both
bit
with
his
tooth

kick
with

at

break

Crabshaw
see
himself
clear
of

do
not

to
take

make
the
most
of
his

to
Greavesbury

which
it
appear

he
be
really
a
gentleman
of
fashion

fortune

they
resolve
to
compromise
the
affair
without

intervention

be
lodge

humble
himself
before

if
he
have
know
his
quality
he
would
have
beat
the

brain
about
his
ear

for
presume
to
give

believe

be
sufficiently

a
cripple

Launcelot
admit
of
his
apology

probably
,
this

the
first
incident
of
their
second
excursion

for

ninety
mile

chapter
vi
in
which
the
reader
will
perceive
that
in
some
case
madness
be
catch

<EOS>
Mr
Clarke
have
make
an
end
of
his
narrative
,
the
surgeon
thank
him
for
the
entertainment
he
have
receive
;
and
Mr
Ferret
shrug
up
his
shoulder
in
silent
disapprobation
.
<EOS>
as
for
captain
Crowe
,
who
use
at
such
pause
to
pour
in
a
broadside
of
dismembered
remark
,
link
together
like
chain
-
shot
,
he
speak
not
a
syllable
for
some
time
;
but
,
light
a
fresh
pipe
at
the
candle
,
begin
to
roll
such
voluminous
cloud
of
smoke
as
in
an
instant
fill
the
whole
apartment
,
and
render
himself
invisible
to
the
whole
company
.
<EOS>
though
he
thus
shroud
himself
from
their
view
,
he
do
not
long
remain
conceal
from
their
hearing
.
   
<EOS>
They
first
hear
a
strange
dissonant
cackle
,
which
the
doctor
know
to
be
a
sea
-
laugh
,
and
this
be
follow
by
an
eager
exclamation
of
"
rare
pastime
,
strike
my
yard
and
top

mast
!
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
good
mind
 
<EOS>
why

I
have
  
smite
my
taffrel

by
this
time
,
he
have
relax
so
much
in
his
fumigation
,
that
the
tip
of
his
nose
and
one
eye
reappear
;
and
as
he
have
draw
his
wig
forwards
so
as
to
cover
his
whole
forehead
,
<EOS>
the
figure
that
now
salute
their
eye
be
much
more
ferocious
and
terrible
than
the
fire
-
breathe
chimaera
of
the
antient
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
dreadful
appearance
,
there
be
no
indignation
in
his
heart
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
an
agreeable
curiosity
,
which
he
be
determined
to
gratify
.
   
<EOS>
address
himself
to
Mr
Fillet

"
Prithee
,

that
you

<EOS>
I
could
keep

long
enough
before

Sam
Crowe

Lord

set
thy

at

Tom

(
cry
the

<EOS>
I
will
have
a
trip
to

again
in
this

channel

<EOS>
mad
!
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
I
think
for
my
part
one
half
of
the
nation
be
mad
 
and
the
other
not
very
find
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
why
I
han't
as
good
a
right
to
be
mad
as
another
man
  
<EOS>
but
,
doctor
,
as
I
be
say
,
I
would
be
bind
to
you
,
if
you
would
direct
me
where
I
can
buy
that
same
tackle
that
an
arrant
must
wear
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
matter
of
the
long
pole
head
with
iron
,
I
would
never
desire
a
well
than
a
good
boat
-
hook
;
and
I
could
make
a
special
good
target
of
that
there
<EOS>
tin
sconce
that
hold
the
candle
 
mayhap
<EOS>
any
blacksmith
will
hammer
me
a
scull
-
cap
,
d'ye
see
,
out
of
an
old
brass
kettle
:
and
I
can
call
my
horse
by
the
name
of
my
ship
,
which
be
Musti
.
   
<EOS>
the
surgeon
be
one
of
those
wag
who
can
laugh
inwardly
,
without
exhibit
the
least
outward
mark
of
mirth
or
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
He
at
once
perceive
the
amusement
which
may
be
draw
from
this
strange
disposition
of
the
sailor
,
together
with
the
most
likely
mean
which
could
be
use
to
divert
him
from
such
an
extravagant
pursuit
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
tip
clarke
the
wink
with
one
side
of
his
face
,
while
the
other
be
very
gravely
turn
to
the
captain
,
whom
he
address
to
this
effect
:
"
<EOS>
It
be
not
far
from
hence
to
Sheffield
,
where
you
may
be
fit
compleatly
in
half
-
a
-
day
  
<EOS>
then
you
must
wake
your
armour
in
church
or
chappel
,
and
be
dub
.
<EOS>
as
for
this
last
ceremony
,
it
may
be
perform
by
any
person
whatsoever
.
<EOS>
Don
Quixote
be
dub
by
his
landlord
;
and
there
be
many
instance
on
record
,
of
errant
oblige
and
compel
the
next
person
they
meet
to
cross
their
shoulder
,
and
dub
them
knight
.
   
<EOS>
I
myself
would
undertake
to
be
your
godfather
;
and
I
have
interest
enough
to
procure
the
key
of
the
parish
church
that
stand
hard
by
;
besides
,
this
be
the
eve
of
St
Martin
,
who
be
himself
a
knight
-
errant
,
and
therefore
a
proper
patron
to
a
noviciate
.
<EOS>
I
wish
we
could
borrow
Sir
Launcelot
's
armour
for
the
occasion
.
"
   
<EOS>
Crowe
,
be
strike
with
this
hint
,
start
up
,
and
lay
his
fingre
on
his
lip
to
enjoin
silence
,
walk
off
softly
on
his
tiptoe
,
to
listen
at
the
door
of
our
knight
's
apartment
,
and
judge
whether
or
not
he
be
asleep
.
<EOS>
Mr
Fillet
take
this
opportunity
to
tell
his
nephew
,
that
it
would
be
in
vain
for
him
to
combat
this
humour
with
reason
and
argument
:
but
the
most
effectual
way
of
divert
him
from
the
plan
of
knight
-
errantry
would
be
,
to
frighten
him
heartily
while
he
should
keep
his
vigil
in
the
church
.
<EOS>
towards
the
accomplishment
of
which
purpose
he
crave
the
assistance
of
the
misanthrope
as
well
as
the
nephew
.
   
<EOS>
Clarke
seem
to
relish
the
scheme
;
and
observe
that
his
uncle
,
though
endue
with
courage
enough
to
face
any
human
danger
,
have
at
bottom
a
strong
fund
of
superstition
,
which
he
have
acquire
,
or
at
least
improve
,
in
the
course
of
a
sea
-
life
.
<EOS>
Ferret
,
who
perhaps
would
not
have
go
ten
pace
out
of
his
road
to
save
Crowe
from
the
gallow
,
nevertheless
,
engage
as
an
auxiliary
,
merely
in
hope
of
see
a
fellow
-
creature
miserable
;
and
even
undertake
to
be
the
principal
agent
in
this
adventure
.
<EOS>
for
this
office
,
indeed
,
he
be
better
qualified
than
they
could
have
imagine
:
in
the
bundle
which
he
keep
under
his
great
coat
,
there
be
,
together
with
diver
nostrum
,
a
small
vial
of
liquid
phosphorus
,
sufficient
,
as
he
have
already
observe
,
to
frighten
a
whole
neighbourhood
out
of
their
sense
.
   
<EOS>
in
order
to
concert
the
previous
measure
,
without
be
overhear
,
these
confederate
retire
with
a
candle
and
lanthorn
into
the
stable
;
and
their
back
be
scarce
turn
,
when
captain
Crowe
come
in
load
with
piece
of
the
knight
's
armour
,
which
he
have
convey
from
the
apartment
of
Sir
Launcelot
,
whom
he
have
leave
fast
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
understanding
that
the
rest
of
the
company
be
go
out
for
a
moment
,
he
could
not
resist
the
inclination
he
feel
of
communicate
his
intention
to
the
landlady
,
who
,
with
her
daughter
,
have
be
too
much
engage
in
prepare
Crabshaw
's
supper
,
to
know
the
purport
of
their
conversation
.
<EOS>
the
good
woman
,
be
inform
of
the
captain
's
design
to
remain
alone
all
night
in
the
church
,
begin
to
oppose
it
with
all
her
rhetorick
.
<EOS>
She
say
it
be
set
his
Maker
at
defiance
,
and
a
wilful
running
into
temptation
.
   
<EOS>
She
assure
him
all
the
country
know
that
the
church
be
haunt
by
spirit
and
hobgoblin
:
that
light
have
be
see
in
every
corner
of
it
;
and
a
tall
woman
in
white
have
one
night
appear
upon
the
top
of
the
tower
:
that
dreadful
shriek
be
often
hear
to
come
from
the
south
aile
,
where
a
murder
man
have
be
bury
:
that
she
herself
have
see
the
cross
on
the
steeple
all
a
-
fire
;
and
one
evening
as
she
pass
a
horse
-
back
close
by
the
stile
at
the
entrance
into
the
church
-
yard
,
the
horse
stand
still
,
sweat
and
tremble
,
and
have
no
power
to
proceed
until
she
have
repeat
the
Lord
's
Prayer
.
   
<EOS>
these
remark
make
a
strong
impression
on
the
imagination
of
Crowe
,
who
ask
,
in
some
confusion
,
if
she
have
get
that
same
prayer
in
print
.
<EOS>
She
make
no
answer
;
but
reach
the
prayer
-
book
from
a
shelf
,
and
turn
up
the
leaf
,
put
it
into
his
hand
:
then
the
captain
,
have
adjust
his
spectacle
,
begin
to
read
or
rather
spell
aloud
with
equal
eagerness
and
solemnity
.
<EOS>
He
have
refresh
his
memory
so
well
as
to
remember
the
whole
;
when
the
doctor
,
return
with
his
companion
,
give
him
to
understand
that
he
have
procure
the
key
of
the
chancel
,
where
he
may
watch
his
armour
as
well
as
in
the
body
of
the
church
;
and
that
he
be
ready
to
conduct
him
to
the
spot
.
   
<EOS>
Crowe
be
not
now
quite
so
forward
as
he
have
appear
before
to
atchieve
this
adventure
.
<EOS>
He
begin
to
start
objection
with
respect
to
the
borrow
armour
:
he
want
to
stipulate
the
comfort
of
a
can
of
flip
,
and
a
candle
's
end
,
during
his
vigil
;
and
hint
something
of
the
damage
he
may
sustain
from
your
malicious
imp
of
darkness
.
   
<EOS>
the
doctor
tell
him
,
the
constitution
of
chivalry
absolutely
require
that
he
should
be
leave
in
the
dark
alone
,
and
fast
,
to
spend
the
night
in
pious
meditation
;
but
if
he
have
any
fear
which
disturb
his
conscience
,
he
have
much
well
desist
,
and
give
up
all
thought
of
knight
-
errantry
,
which
could
not
consist
with
the
least
shadow
of
apprehension
.
<EOS>
the
captain
,
sting
by
this
remark
,
reply
not
a
word
;
but
gather
up
the
armour
into
a
bundle
,
throw
it
on
his
back
,
and
set
out
for
the
place
of
probation
,
precede
by
Clarke
with
the
lanthorn
.
   
<EOS>
when
they
arrive
at
the
church
,
Fillet
,
who
have
procure
the
key
from
the
sexton
,
who
be
his
patient
,
open
the
door
,
and
conduct
our
novice
into
the
middle
of
the
chancel
,
where
the
armour
be
deposit
.
<EOS>
then
bid
Crowe
draw
his
hanger
,
commit
him
to
the
protection
of
heaven
,
assure
him
he
would
come
back
,
and
find
him
either
dead
or
alive
by
day
-
break
,
and
perform
the
remain
part
of
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
and
the
other
associate
shake
him
by
the
hand
and
take
their
leave
,
after
the
surgeon
have
tilt
up
the
lanthorn
,
in
order
to
take
a
view
of
his
visage
,
which
be
pale
and
haggard
.
   
<EOS>
before
the
door
be
lock
upon
him
,
he
call
aloud
,
"
Hilloa
!
<EOS>
doctor
,
hip
 
<EOS>
another
word
,
d'ye
see
 
<EOS>
"
They
forthwith
return
,
to
know
what
he
want
,
and
find
him
already
in
a
sweat
.
"
<EOS>
Heark
ye
,
brother
(
say
he
,
wipe
his
face
)
<EOS>
I
do
suppose
as
how
one
may
pass
away
the
time
in
whistle
the
black
joke
,
or
singe
black
-
ey'd
Susan
,
or
some
such
sorrowful
ditty
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
by
no
mean
,
(
cry
the
doctor
)
<EOS>
such
pastime
be
neither
suitable
to
the
place
,
nor
the
occasion
,
which
be
altogether
a
religious
exercise
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
get
any
psalm
by
heart
,
you
may
sing
a
stave
or
two
,
or
repeat
the
doxology
.
"
<EOS>
"
Would
I
have
Tom
Laverick
here
,
(
reply
our
novitiate
)
<EOS>
he
would
sing
you
anthem
like
a
sea
-
mew
 
a
have
be
a
clerk
a

shore
 
<EOS>
many
be
the
time
<EOS>
and
often
I
have
give
him
a
rope
's
end
for
singe
psalm
in
the
larboard
watch
 
<EOS>
would
I
have
hire
the
son
of
a
bitch
to
have
teach
me
a
cast
of
his
office
 
<EOS>
but
it
can
not
be
holp
,
<EOS>
brother
  
if
we
can
not
go
large
,
we
must
haul
upon
a
wind
,
as
the
saying
be
  
if
we
can
not
sing
,
we
must
pray
.
<EOS>
"
the
company
again
leave
him
to
his
devotion
,
and
return
to
the
public
house
,
in
order
to
execute
the
essential
part
of
their
project

<EOS>
chapter
VII
in
which
the
knight
resume
his
importance
.
 
<EOS>
Doctor
Fillet
have
borrow
a
couple
of
sheet
from
the
landlady
,
dress
the
misanthrope
and
Tom
Clarke
in
ghostly
apparel
,
which
be
re

inforce
by
a
few
drop
of
liquid
phosphorus
,
from
Ferret
's
phial
,
rub
on
the
fore

head
of
the
two
adventurer
.
<EOS>
thus
equipped
they
return
to
the
church
with
their
conductor
,
who
enter
with
them
softly
at
an
aile
which
be
opposite
to
a
place
where
the
novice
keep
watch

<EOS>
They
steal
unperceived
through
the
body
of
the
church
;
and
though
it
be
so
dark
that
they
could
not
distinguish
the
captain
with
the
eye
,
they
hear
the
sound
of
his
step
,
as
he
walk
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
pavement
with
uncommon
expedition
,
and
an
ejaculation
now
and
then
escape
in
murmur
from
his
lip
.
   
<EOS>
the
triumvirate
have
take
their
station
,
with
a
large
pew
in
their
front
,
the
two
ghost
uncover
their
head
,
which
,
by
help
of
the
phosphorus
,
exhibit
a
pale
and
lambent
flame
,
extremely
dismal
and
ghastly
to
the
view
;
then
Ferret
,
in
a
squeak
tone
exclaim
,
"
Samuel
Crowe
!
<EOS>
Samuel
Crowe
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
captain
hear
himself
accost
in
this
manner
,
at
such
a
time
,
and
in
such
a
place
,
reply
,
"
Hilloah
;
"
and
turn
his
eye
towards
the
quarter
<EOS>
whence
the
voice
seem
to
proceed
,
beheld
the
terrible
apparition
.
<EOS>
this
no
sooner
salute
his
view
,
than
his
hair
bristle
up
,
his
knee
begin
to
knock
,
and
his
tooth
to
chatter
,
while
he
cry
aloud
,
"
in
the
name
of
God
,
where
be
you
bind
,
ho
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
to
this
hail
,
the
misanthrope
answer
,
"
We
be
the
spirit
of
thy
grandmother
Jane
and
thy
aunt
Bridget
.
"
   
<EOS>
at
mention
of
these
name
,
Crowe
's
terror
begin
to
give
way
to
his
resentment
,
and
he
pronounce
in
a
quick
tone
of
surprize
,
mix
with
indignation
,
<EOS>
"
what
d'ye
want

<EOS>
what
d'ye

<EOS>
what

<EOS>
the

,
"
We

thee
of
thy
fate

<EOS>
"
from
whence

"
cry
the
captain
,
whose
choler
have
by
this
time
<EOS>
well
nigh
triumph
over
his
fear
.
<EOS>
"
from
heaven
,
"
say
the
voice
.
"
<EOS>
ye
lie
,
ye
b####s
of
hell

<EOS>
(
do
our
novice
exclaim
)
<EOS>
ye

damned
for

me
out
of
my
right
,
five
fathom
and
a
half
by
the

in

<EOS>
do
not
I

the

out

<EOS>
mayhap
you

<EOS>
so
say
,
he
have
recourse
to
his
Pater
-
noster
;
but
,
perceive
the
apparition
approach
,
he
thunder
out
,
"
Avast

avast

ye
babe

I
will

"
   
<EOS>
He
accordingly
spring
forwards
with
his
hanger
,
and
very
probably
would
have
set
the
spirit
on
their
way
to
the
other
world
,
have
not
he
fall
over
a
pew
in
the
dark
,
and
intangle
himself
so
much
among
the
bench
,
that
he
could
not
immediately
recover
his
footing
.
<EOS>
the
triumvirate
take
this
opportunity
to
retire
;
and
such
be
the
precipitation
of
Ferret
in
his
retreat
,
that
he
encounter
a
post
,
by
which
his
right
eye
sustain
considerable
damage
:
a
circumstance
which
induce
him
to
inveigh
bitterly
against
his
own
folly
,
as
well
as
the
impertinence
of
his
companion
,
who
have
inveigle
him
into
such
a
troublesome
adventure
.
<EOS>
neither
he
nor
Clarke
could
be
prevail
upon
to
revisit
the
novice
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
himself
think
his
disease
be
desperate
;
and
,
mount
his
horse
,
return
to
his
own
habitation
.
   
<EOS>
Ferret
,
find
all
the
bed
in
the
public
house
be
occupy
,
compose
himself
to
sleep
in
a
windsor
-
chair
at
the
chimney
-
corner
;
and
Mr
Clarke
,
whose
disposition
be
extremely
amorous
,
resolve
to
renew
his
practice
on
the
heart
of
Dolly
.
<EOS>
He
have
reconnoitre
the
apartment
in
which
the
body
of
the
knight
and
his
squire
be
deposit
,
and
discover
close
by
the
top
of
the
stair
-
case
a
sort
of
a
closet
or
hovel
just
large
enough
to
contain
a
truckle
-
bed
,
which
,
from
some
other
particular
,
he
suppose
to
be
the
bed
-
chamber
of
his
beloved
Dolly
,
who
have
by
this
time
retire
to
her
repose
.
   
<EOS>
full
of
this
idea
,
and
instigate
by
the
daemon
of
desire
<EOS>
,
Mr
Thomas
creep
softly
up
stair
;
and
lift
the
latch
of
the
closet
-
door
,
his
heart
begin
to
palpitate
with
joyous
expectation
:
but
before
he
could
breathe
the
gentle
effusion
of
his
love
,
the
suppose
damsel
start
up
,
and
seize
him
by
the
collar
with
an
herculean
gripe
,
utter
,
in
the
voice
of
Crabshaw
,
"
It
wa'n't
for
nothing
that
I
dream
of
Newgate
,
sirrah
;
but
I
would
have
thee
to
know
,
an
arrant
squire
be
not
to
be
rob
by
such
a
peddling
thief
as
thee

thee

"
   
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
Mr
Clarke
to
disengage
himself
,
and
equally
impracticable
to
speak
in
his
own
vindication
;
so
that
here
he
stand
tremble
and
half
throttled
,
until
the
whole
house
be
alarm
,
the
landlady
and
her
ostler
run
up
stair
with
a
candle
.
<EOS>
when
the
light
render
object
visible

an
equal
astonishment
prevail
on
all
side

<EOS>
Crabshaw
be
confound
at
sight
of
Mr
Clarke

whose
person
he
well
know
;
and
release
him
instantly
from
his
grasp
,
"
bodikin
!
<EOS>
(
cry
he
)
<EOS>
I
believe
as
how
this
hawse
be
haunt
 
who
think
to
meet
with
Measter
Laayer
Clarke
at
midnight
,
and
so
far
from
hoam
.
<EOS>
"
the
landlady
could
not
comprehend
the
meaning
of
this
encounter
;
nor
could
Tom
conceive
how
Crabshaw
have
transport
himself
hither
from
the
room
below
,
in
which
he
see
him
quietly
repose
.
   
<EOS>
yet
nothing
be
more
easy
than
to
explain
this
mystery
:
the
apartment
below
be
the
chamber
which
the
hostess
and
her
daughter
reserve
for
their
own
convenience
;
and
this
particular
having
be
intimate
to
the
squire
while
he
be
at
supper
,
he
have
resign
the
bed
quietly
,
and
be
conduct
hither
in
the
absence
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
Tom
,
recollect
himself
as
well
as
he
could
,
profess
himself
of
Crabshaw
's
opinion
,
that
the
house
be
haunt
,
declare
that
he
could
not
well
account
for
his
be
there
in
the
dark
;
and
leave
those
that
be
assemble
to
discuss
this
knotty
point
,
retire
down
stair
,
in
hope
of
meet
with
his
charmer
,
whom
accordingly
he
find
in
the
kitchen
just
rise
,
and
wrap
in
a
loose
dishabille
.
   
<EOS>
the
noise
of
Crabshaw
's
cry
have
awaken
and
arouse
his
master
,
who
,
rise
suddenly
in
the
dark
,
snatch
up
his
sword
that
lie
by
his
bed
-
side
,
and
hasten
to
the
scene
of
tumult
,
where
all
their
mouth
be
open
at
once
,
to
explain
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
,
and
make
an
apology
for
break
his
honour
's
rest
.
<EOS>
He
say
nothing
;
but
take
the
candle
in
his
hand
,
beckon
to
his
squire
to
follow
him
into
his
apartment
,
resolve
to
arm
and
take
horse
immediately
.
<EOS>
Crabshaw
understand
his
meaning
;
and
while
he
shuffle
on
his
cloath
,
yawn
hideously
all
the
while
,
wish
the
lawyer
at
the
devil
for
have
visit
him
so
unseasonably
;
and
even
curse
himself
for
the
noise
he
have
make
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
foresee
he
should
now
be
oblige
to
forfeit
his
night
's
rest
,
and
travel
in
the
dark
,
expose
to
the
inclemency
of
the
weather

"
<EOS>
Pox

he
to

He
have
just
finish
this
soliloquy
as
he
enter
the
apartment
of
his
master

who
desire
to
know
what
be
become
of
his
armour

<EOS>
Timothy

be
leave
in
the
room
when
the
knight
undress

begin
to
scratch
his
head
in
great
perplexity
;
and
at
last
declare
it
as
his
opinion
that
it
must
have
be
carry
off
by
witchcraft

<EOS>
then
he
relate
his
adventure
with
Tom
Clarke
,
who
he
say

to
his
bedside
he
know

how

and
conclude
,
with
affirming
they
be
no
well
than
Papishes

who
do
not

in
witchcraft

<EOS>
Sir
Launcelot
could
not
help
smile
at
his
simplicity

but
assume
a
peremptory
air
,
he
command
him
to
fetch
the
armour
without
delay
,
that
he
may
afterwards
saddle
the
horse

in

Timothy
retire
in
great
tribulation
to
the
kitchen

where

the
misanthrope
,
whom
the
noise
have
also

,
and
still
impressed
with
the
notion

he
offer
him
a
shilling
if
he
would
cast
a
figure

him
know
what

<EOS>
Ferret
,
in

more
mischief

inform
him
without
hesitation
,
that
one
of
the
company
have
convey
it
into
the
chancel
of
the
church

where
he
would

find

deposit

at

him
with
the
key

which
Mr

these
hour

thus
attend

he
advance
to
the
place

where
the

it
upon

in

with
vast
vociferation

<EOS>
Timothy
and
his
friend

so
intimidate
by
this
terrific
strain

that
they
think
no
more
of

but
run
home
arm

appear
in
the
kitchen
with
all
the
mark

horror

consternation

<EOS>
when
Sir

come
forth

and
demand
his

Crabshaw
declare
that

assertion

Ferret
sit
in

at

by
heaven
he
would
dash
their
soul
out

and
raze
the
house
to
the
foundation

come
into

<EOS>
Tom
forthwith
begin
a
very
circumstantial
recapitulation

what
have
happen
to
his

in
what
manner

have
be
disappoint
of
the
estate
;
how
he

accidentally

his
honour

be
enamour
of
his
character

become
ambitious
of

his
example

then
he
relate
the
particular
of
the
plan

lay
down
to
divert
him
from
his

conclude
with

"
   
<EOS>
when
he
have
thus
disburthene
his
conscience
,
Sir
Launcelot
introduce
the
subject
of
the
new
occupation
at
which
he
aspire
.
<EOS>
"
I
understand
,
say
he
,
that
you
be
desirous
of
tread
the
path
of
errantry
,
which
I
assure
you
,
be
thorny
and
troublesome
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
as
your
purpose
be
to
exercise
your
humanity
and
benevolence
,
so
your
ambition
be
commendable
.
<EOS>
but
towards
the
practice
of
chivalry
,
there
be
something
more
required
than
the
virtue
of
courage
and
generosity
.
<EOS>
a
knight
-
errant
ought
to
understand
the
science
,
to
be
master
of
ethic
or
morality
,
to
be
well
verse
in
theology
,
a
complete
casuist
,
and
minutely
acquaint
with
the
law
of
his
country
.
<EOS>
He
should
not
only
be
patient
of
cold
,
hunger
,
and
fatigue
,
righteous
,
just
,
and
valiant
;
but
also
chaste
,
religious
,
temperate
,
polite
,
and
conversable
;
and
have
all
his
passion
under
the
rein
,
except
love
,
whose
empire
he
should
submissively
acknowledge
.
   
<EOS>
He
say
,
this
be
the
very
essence
of
chivalry
,
and
no
man
have
ever
make
such
a
profession
of
arm
,
without
have
first
place
his
affection
upon
some
beauteous
object
,
for
whose
honour
,
and
at
whose
command
,
he
would
chearfully
encounter
the
most
dreadful
peril
.
   
<EOS>
He
take
notice
that
nothing
could
be
more
irregular
than
the
manner
in
which
Crowe
have
attempt
to
keep
his
vigil
:
for
he
have
never
serve
his
noviciate
 
<EOS>
he
have
not
prepare
himself
with
abstinence
and
prayer
 
<EOS>
he
have
not
provide
a
qualified
godfather
for
the
ceremony
of
dub
 
<EOS>
he
have
no
armour
of
his
own
to
wake
;
but
,
on
the
very
threshold
of
chivalry
,
which
be
the
perfection
of
justice
,
have
unjustly
purloin
the
arm
of
another
knight
:
that
this
be
a
meer
mockery
of
a
religious
institution
;
and
therefore
unplease
in
the
sight
of
heaven
;
witness
,
the
demon
and
hobgoblin
that
be
permit
to
disturb
and
torment
him
in
his
trial
.
   
<EOS>
Crowe
have
listen
to
these
remark
,
with
earnest
attention
,
reply
,
after
some
hesitation
:
"
I
be

if
Sir
Launcelot
would
take
him
in

as
his

he
would
stand
by
him
all

the
knight
say
,
he
do
not
think
himself
of
consequence
enough
to
have
such
a
pupil

should
always
be
ready
to
give
him
his
good
advice

as
a

he
exhort
him

weigh
all
the

deliberate
calmly

leisurely

before

in
such
a

assure
him
that
if

at

end

his

he

from
his
honour
's
side
,
he
be
oblige
to
alight
,
and
fasten
Bronzomarte
to
a
tree
:
then
they
set
out
together
,
and
with
some
difficulty
find
Gilbert
with
his
neck
stretch
over
a
five
bar
gate
,
snuff
up
the
morning
-
air
.
   
<EOS>
the
squire
,
however
,
be
not
remount
,
without
have
first
undergo
a
severe
reprehension
from
his
master
,
who
upbraid
him
with
his
cowardice
,
threaten
to
chastise
him
on
the
spot
,
and
declare
that
he
would
divorce
his
dastardly
soul
from
his
body
,
should
he
ever
be
incommode
or
affront
with
another
instance
of
his
base
-
bear
apprehension
.
<EOS>
though
there
be
some
risque
in
carry
on
the
altercation
at
this
juncture
,
Timothy
have
bind
up
his
jaw
,
could
not
withstand
the
inclination
he
have
to
confute
his
master
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
,
in
a
muttering
accent
,
protest
that
if
the
knight
would
give
him
leave
,
he
should
prove
that
his
honour
have
tie
a
knot
with
his
tongue
which
he
could
not
untie
with
all
his
tooth
.
<EOS>
"
how
,
caitiff
,
(
cry
Sir
Launcelot
)
presume
to
contend
with
me
in
argument
!
"
<EOS>
"
Your
mouth
be
scarce
shut
,
(
say
the
other
)
since
you
declare
that
a
man
be
not
to
be
punish
for
madness
,
because
it
be
a
distemper
:
now
I
will
maintain
that
cowardice
be
a
distemper
as
well
as
madness
;
for
nobody
would
be
afraid
if
he
could
help
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
there
be
more
logic
in
that
remark
(
resume
the
knight
)
than
I
expect
from
your
clod
-
pate
,
Crabshaw
:
but
I
must
explain
the
difference
between
cowardice
and
madness
.
   
<EOS>
Cowardice
,
tho
'
sometimes
the
effect
of
natural
imbecility
,
be
generally
a
prejudice
of
education
,
or
bad
habit
contract
from
misinformation
,
or
misapprehension
,
and
may
certainly
be
cure
by
experience
,
and
the
exercise
of
reason
:
but
this
remedy
can
not
be
apply
in
madness
,
which
be
a
privation
or
disorder
of
reason
itself
.
"
<EOS>
"
so
be
cowardice
,
as
I
be
a
live
soul
,
(
exclaim
the
squire
)
<EOS>
do
not
you
say
a
man
be
frighten
out
of
his
sense
?
<EOS>
for
my
peart
,
measter
,
I
can
neither
see
nor
hear
,
much
less
argufy
when
I
be
in
such
a
quandary
:
<EOS>
wherefore
,
I
believe
,
odd
bodikin
!
<EOS>
that
cowardice
and
madness
be
both
distemper
,
and
differ
no
more
than
the
hot
and
cold
fit
of
an
ague
.
<EOS>
when
it
teake
your
honour
,
you
be
all
heat
and
fire
and
fury
,
Lord
bless
us
!
<EOS>
but
when
it
catch
poor
Tim
,
he
be
cold
and
dead
-
hearted
,
he
sheake
and
shiver
like
an
aspen
-
leaf
,
that
he
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
in
that
case
,
(
answer
the
knight
)
<EOS>
I
shall
not
punish
you
for
the
distemper
which
you
can
not
help
,
but
for
engage
in
a
service
expose
to
peril
,
when
you
know
your
own
infirmity
:
in
the
same
manner
as
a
man
deserve
punishment
,
who
enlist
himself
for
a
soldier
,
while
he
labour
under
any
secret
disease
.
"
<EOS>
"
at
that
rate
(
say
the
squire
)
<EOS>
my
bread
be
like
to
be
rarely
butter
o'both
side
<EOS>
,
I
faith
.
<EOS>
but
,
I
hope
,
as
by
the
blessing
of
God
I
have
run
mad
,
so
<EOS>
I
shall
in
good
time
grow
valiant
,
under
your
honour
's
precept
and
example
.
"
   
<EOS>
by
this
time
a
very
disagreeable
night
be
succeed
by
a
fair
,
bright
morning
,
and
a
market
-
town
appear
at
the
distance
of
three
or
four
mile
,
when
Crabshaw
,
have
no
longer
the
fear
of
hobgoblin
before
his
eye
,
and
be
moreover
cheare
by
the
sight
of
a
place
where
he
hope
to
meet
with
comfortable
entertainment
,
begin
to
talk
big
,
to
expatiate
on
the
folly
of
be
afraid
,
and
finally
set
all
danger
at
defiance
;
when
all
of
a
sudden
he
be
present
with
an
opportunity
of
put
in
practice
those
new
adopt
maxim
.
<EOS>
in
an
opening
between
two
lane
,
they
perceive
a
gentleman
's
coach
stop
by
two
highwayman
on
horseback
,
one
of
whom
advance
to
reconnoitre
and
keep
the
coast
clear
,
while
the
other
exact
contribution
from
the
traveller
in
the
coach
.
<EOS>
He
who
act
as
centinel
,
no
sooner
see
our
adventurer
appear
from
the
lane
,
than
he
ride
up
with
a
pistol
in
his
hand
,
and
order
him
to
halt
on
pain
of
immediate
death
.
   
<EOS>
to
this
peremptory
mandate
the
knight
make
no
other
reply
than
charge
him
with
such
impetuosity
that
he
be
unhorsed
in
a
twinkling
,
and
lie
sprawl
on
the
ground
,
seemingly
sore
bruise
with
his
fall
.
<EOS>
Sir
Launcelot
command
Timothy
to
alight
and
secure
the
prisoner
,
couch
his
launce
,
and
ride
full
speed
at
the
other
highwayman
,
who
be
not
a
little
disturb
at
sight
of
such
an
apparition
.
   
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
fire
his
pistol
without
effect
;
and
,
clap
spur
to
his
horse
,
flee
away
at
full
gallop
.
<EOS>
the
knight
pursue
him
with
all
the
speed
that
Bronzomarte
could
exert
;
but
the
robber
be
mount
on
a
swift
hunter
,
keep
him
at
a
distance
;
and
,
after
a
chace
of
several
mile
,
escape
thro
'
a
wood
so
entangle
with
coppice
,
that
Sir
Launcelot
think
proper
to
desist
.
<EOS>
He
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
recollect
the
situation
in
which
he
have
leave
the
other
thief
,
and
remember
to
have
hear
a
female
shriek
,
as
he
pass
by
the
coach
-
window
,
resolve
to
return
with
all
expedition
,
that
he
may
make
a
proffer
of
his
service
to
the
lady
,
accord
to
the
obligation
of
knight
-
errantry
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
lose
his
way
;
and
after
an
hour
's
ride
,
during
which
he
traverse
many
a
field
,
and
circle
diver
hedge
,
he
find
himself
in
the
market
-
town
aforementioned
.
   
<EOS>
here
the
first
object
that
present
itself
to
his
eye
,
be
Crabshaw
,
on
foot
,
surround
by
a
mob
,
tear
his
hair
,
stamp
with
his
foot
,
and
roar
out
in
manifest
distraction
,
"
shew
me
<EOS>
the
mayor
,
(
for
the
love
of
God
)
<EOS>
shew
me
the
mayor

o

a
murrain
take
thee
,
Gilbert
!
<EOS>
sure
thou
wast
foal
for
my
destruction

"
   
<EOS>
from
these
exclamation
,
and
the
antic
dress
of
the
squire
,
the
people
,
not
without
reason
,
conclude
that
the
poor
soul
have
lose
his
wit
;
and
the
beadle
be
just
go
to
secure
him
,
when
the
knight
interpose
,
and
at
once
attract
the
whole
attention
of
the
populace
.
<EOS>
Timothy
,
see
his
master
,
fall
down
on
his
knee
,
cry
"
the
thief
have
run
away
with
Gilbert
 
<EOS>
you
may
pound
me
into
a
peast
,
as
the
saying
be
:
but
now
i'se
as
mad
as
your
worship
;
an't
afeard
of
the
devil
and
all
his
work
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sir
Launcelot
desire
the
beadle
would
forbear
,
be
instantly
obey
by
that
officer
,
who
have
no
inclination
to
put
the
authority
of
his
place
in
competition
with
the
power
of
such
a
figure
arm
at
all
point
,
mount
on
a
fiery
steed
,
and
ready
for
the
combat
.
   
<EOS>
He
order
Crabshaw
to
attend
him
to
the
next
inn
,
where
he
alight
;
then
take
him
into
a
separate
apartment
,
demand
an
explanation
of
the
unconnected
word
he
have
utter
.
<EOS>
the
squire
be
in
such
agitation
,
that
,
with
infinite
difficulty
,
and
by
dint
of
a
thousand
different
question
,
his
master
learn
the
adventure
to
this
effect
:
Crabshaw
,
accord
to
Sir
Launcelot
's
command
,
have
alight
from
his
horse
,
and
draw
his
cutlass
,
in
hope
of
intimidate
the
discomfited
robber
into
a
tame
surrender
,
though
he
do
not
at
all
relish
the
nature
of
the
service
:
but
the
thief
be
neither
so
much
hurt
,
nor
so
tame
as
Timothy
have
imagine
.
<EOS>
He
start
on
his
foot
with
his
pistol
still
in
his
hand
;
and
present
it
to
the
squire
,
swear
with
dreadful
imprecation
,
that
he
would
blow
his
brain
out
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
Crabshaw
,
unwilling
to
hazard
the
trial
of
this
experiment
,
turn
his
back
,
and
flee
with
great
precipitation
;
while
the
robber
,
whose
horse
have
run
away
,
mount
Gilbert
,
and
ride
off
across
the
country
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
at
this
period
,
that
two
footman
belong
to
the
coach
,
who
have
stay
behind
to
take
their
morning
's
whet
,
at
the
inn
where
they
lodge
,
come
up
to
the
assistance
of
the
lady
,
arm
with
blunderbuss
;
and
the
carriage
proceed
,
leave
Timothy
alone
in
distraction
and
despair
.
<EOS>
He
know
not
which
way
to
turn
,
and
be
afraid
of
remain
on
the
spot
,
lest
the
robber
should
come
back
and
revenge
themselves
upon
him
for
the
disappointment
they
have
undergo
.
<EOS>
in
this
distress
,
the
first
thought
that
occur
,
be
to
make
the
good
of
his
way
to
the
town
,
and
demand
the
assistance
of
the
civil
magistrate
towards
the
retrieval
of
what
he
have
lose
:
a
design
which
he
execute
in
such
a
manner
,
as
justly
entail
upon
him
the
imputation
of
lunacy
.
   
<EOS>
while
Timothy
stand
front
the
window
,
and
answer
the
interrogation
of
his
master
,
he
suddenly
exclaim
,
"
bodikin
!
<EOS>
there
be
Gilbert
!
"
and
spring
into
the
street
with
incredible
agility
.
   
<EOS>
there
find
his
strayed
companion
bring
back
by
one
of
the
footman
who
attend
the
coach
,
he
imprint
a
kiss
on
his
forehead
;
and
hang
about
his
neck
,
with
the
tear
in
his
eye
,
hail
his
return
with
the
follow
salutation
:
"
<EOS>
art
thou
come
back
,
my
darling
?
<EOS>
ah
Gilbert
,
Gilbert
!
<EOS>
a
pize
upon
thee
!
<EOS>
thou
hadst
like
to
have
be
a
dear
Gilbert
to
me
!
<EOS>
how
couldst
thou
break
the
heart
of
thy
old
friend
,
who
have
know
thee
from
a
colt
?
<EOS>
seven
year
next
grass
have
I
feed
thee
and
breed
thee
;
provide
thee
with
sweet
hay
,
delicate
corn
,
and
fresh
litter
,
that
thou
mought
lie
warm
,
dry
,
and
confortable
.
   
<EOS>
Ha'n't
<EOS>
I
currycomb
thy
carcase
 
'
till
it
be
as
sleek
as
a
sloe
,
and
cherish
thee
as
the
apple
of
mine
eye
?
<EOS>
for
all
that
thou
hast
play
me
an
hundred
dog'
-
trick
;
biting
,
and
kick
,
and
plunge
,
as
if
the
devil
be
in
thy
body
;
and
now
thou
couldst
run
away
with
a
thief
,
and
leave
me
to
be
flea'd
alive
by
master
:
what
canst
thou
say
for
thyself
,
thou
cruel
,
hard
-
hearted
,
unchristian
tuoad
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
to
this
tender
expostulation
,
which
afford
much
entertainment
to
the
boy
,
Gilbert
answer
not
one
word
;
but
seem
altogether
insensible
to
the
caress
of
Timothy
,
who
forthwith
lead
him
into
the
stable
.
<EOS>
on
the
whole
,
he
seem
to
have
be
an
unsocial
animal
:
for
it
do
not
appear
that
he
ever
contract
any
degree
of
intimacy
,
even
with
Bronzomarte
,
during
the
whole
course
of
their
acquaintance
and
fellowship
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
he
have
be
more
than
once
know
to
signify
his
aversion
by
throw
out
behind
,
and
other
eruptive
mark
of
contempt
for
that
elegant
charger
,
who
excel
him
as
much
in
personal
merit
,
as
his
rider
Timothy
be
outshine
by
his
all
-
accomplish
master
.
   
<EOS>
while
the
squire
accommodate
Gilbert
in
the
stable
,
the
knight
send
for
the
footman
who
have
bring
him
back
;
and
,
have
present
him
with
a
liberal
acknowledgment
,
desire
to
know
in
what
manner
the
horse
have
be
retrieve
.
   
<EOS>
the
stranger
satisfy
him
in
this
particular
,
by
give
him
to
understand
,
that
the
highwayman
,
perceive
himself
pursue
across
the
country
,
ply
Gilbert
so
severely
with
whip
and
spur
,
that
the
animal
resent
the
usage
,
and
be
besides
,
perhaps
,
a
little
strike
with
remorse
for
have
leave
his
old
friend
Crabshaw
,
suddenly
halt
,
and
stand
stock
still
,
notwithstanding
all
the
stripe
and
torture
he
undergo
;
or
if
he
move
at
all
,
it
be
in
a
retrograde
direction
.
<EOS>
the
thief
,
see
all
his
endeavour
ineffectual
,
and
himself
in
danger
of
be
overtake
,
wisely
quit
his
acquisition
,
and
flee
into
the
bosom
of
a
neighbour
wood
.
   
<EOS>
then
the
knight
inquire
about
the
situation
of
the
lady
in
the
coach
,
and
offer
himself
as
her
guard
and
conductor
:
but
be
tell
that
she
be
already
safely
lodge
in
the
house
of
a
gentleman
at
some
distance
from
the
road
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
learn
that
she
be
a
person
disorder
in
her
sense
,
under
the
care
and
tuition
of
a
widow
lady
her
relation
;
and
that
in
a
day
or
two
they
should
pursue
their
journey
northward
to
the
place
of
her
habitation
.
<EOS>
after
the
footman
have
be
some
time
dismiss
,
the
knight
recollect
that
he
have
forget
to
ask
the
name
of
the
person
to
whom
he
belong
;
and
begin
to
be
uneasy
at
this
omission
,
which
indeed
be
more
interesting
than
he
could
imagine
:
for
an
explanation
of
this
nature
would
in
all
likelihood
,
have
lead
to
a
discovery
,
that
the
lady
in
the
coach
be
no
other
than
Miss
Aurelia
Darnel
,
who
see
him
unexpectedly
in
such
an
equipage
and
attitude
,
as
he
pass
the
coach
,
(
for
his
helmet
be
off
)
have
scream
with
surprize
and
terror
,
and
faint
away
.
   
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
when
she
recover
from
her
swoon
,
she
conceal
the
real
cause
of
her
agitation
,
and
none
of
her
attendant
be
acquaint
with
the
person
of
Sir
Launcelot
.
   
<EOS>
the
circumstance
of
the
disorder
,
under
which
she
be
say
to
labour
,
shall
be
reveal
in
due
course
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
our
adventurer
,
though
unaccountably
affect
,
never
dream
of
such
an
occurrence
;
but
be
very
much
fatigued
,
resolve
to
indemnify
himself
for
the
loss
of
last
night
's
repose
;
and
this
happen
to
be
one
of
the
few
thing
in
which
Crabshaw
feel

such
a
variety
of
noise

as

have
discompose
a
brain
of
the
firm
texture

<EOS>
the
rumbling
of
carriage
,
and
the
rattling
of
horse
foot
on
the
pavement
,
be
intermingle
with
loud
shout
,
and
the
noise
of
fiddle
,
french

horn
,
and
bagpipe
.
<EOS>
a
loud
peal
be
hear
ring
in
the
church

tower
,
at
some
distance
,
while
the
inn

with
clamour

and
uproar

<EOS>
Sir

thus
alarm

start
from
his

,
and
run
to
the
window
,
beheld
a
cavalcade
of

<EOS>
They

one
of

<EOS>
He

a
jolly
figure
,
of
a
florid
complexion
and
round
belly
,
seemingly
turn
of
fifty

and
,
in
all
appearance
,
of
a
choleric
disposition
.
<EOS>
as
they
approach
the
market

place
they
wave
their
hat
,
huzza'd
,
and
cry
aloud
,
no
Foreign
Connections
,
  
Old

England
for
ever
.
   
<EOS>
this
acclamation
,
however
,
be
not
so
loud
or
universal
,
but
that
our
adventurer
could
distinctly
hear
a
counter
-
cry
from
the
populace
,
of
no
Slavery
,
 
no
Popish
Pretender
.
<EOS>
an
insinuation
so
ill
relish
by
the
cavalier
,
that
they
begin
to
ply
their
horsewhip
among
the
multitude
,
and
be
,
in
their
turn
,
salute
with
a
discharge
or
volley
of
stone
,
dirt
,
and
dead
cat
;
in
consequence
of
which
some
tooth
be
demolish
,
and
many
surtout
defile
.
   
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
's
attention
be
soon
call
off
from
this
scene
,
to
contemplate
another
procession
of
people
on
foot
,
adorn
with
bunche
of
orange
ribbon
,
attend
by
a
regular
band
of
musick
,
play
God

great
George
our

and
head

a
thin
,
swarthy
personage
,
of
a
sallow
aspect
and
large
goggling
eye
,
arch
over
with
two
thick
semicircle
of
hair
,
or
rather
bristle
,
jet
black
,
and
frowzy
.
<EOS>
His
apparel
be
very
gorgeous
,
though
his
address
be
aukward
;
he
be
accompany
by
the
mayor
,
recorder
,
and
head
of
the
corporation
,
in
their
formality
.
   
<EOS>
His
ensign
be
know
by
the
inscription
,
Liberty
of
Conscience
and
the
Protestant
Succession
;
and
the
people
salute
him
as
he
pass
with
repeat
cheer
,
that
seem
to
prognosticate
success
.
<EOS>
He
have
particularly
ingratiate
himself
with
the
good
woman
,
who
line
the
street
,
and
send
forth
many
ejaculatory
petition
in
his
favour
.
   
<EOS>
Sir
Launcelot
immediately
comprehend
the
meaning
of
this
solemnity
:
he
perceive
it
be
the
prelude
to
the
election
of
a
member
to
represent
the
county
in
parliament
,
and
he
be
seize
with
an
eager
desire
to
know
the
name
and
character
of
the
competitor
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
gratify
this
desire
,
he
make
repeated
application
to
the
bell
-
rope
that
depend
from
the
cieling
of
his
apartment
;
but
this
produce
nothing
,
except
the
repetition
of
the
word
"
Coming
,
Sir
,
"
which
ecchoe
from
three
or
four
different
corner
of
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
the
waiter
be
so
distract
by
a
variety
of
call
,
that
they
stand
motionless
,
in
the
state
of
the
schoolman
's
ass
between
two
bundle
of
hay
,
incapable
of
determine
where
they
should
first
offer
their
attendance
.
   
<EOS>
Our
knight
's
patience
be
almost
exhaust
,
when
Crabshaw
enter
the
room
,
in
a
very
strange
equipage
:
one
half
of
his
face
appear
close
shave
,
and
the
other
cover
with
lather
,
while
the
blood
trickle
in
two
rivulet
from
his
nose
,
upon
a
barber
's
cloth
that
be
tuck
under
his
chin
;
he
look
grim
with
indignation
,
and
under
his
left
arm
carry
his
cutlass
,
unsheathed
.
<EOS>
where
he
have
acquire
so
much
of
the
profession
of
knight
-
errantry
<EOS>
we
shall
not
pretend
to
determine
;
but
,
certain
it
be
,
he
fall
on
his
knee
before
Sir
Launcelot
,
cry
,
with
an
accent
of
rage
and
distraction
,
"
<EOS>
in
the
name
of
St
George
for
England
,
I
beg
a
boon
,
Sir
knight

and
thy

I
demand

before
the

"
   
<EOS>
Sir
Launcelot

astonish
at
this
address
,
reply
in
a
lofty
strain
,
"
valiant

provide
it
doth
not
contravene
the
law
of
the
land

constitution
of

"
<EOS>
"
then
I
crave
leave
(
answer
Crabshaw
)
to
challenge
and
defy
to
mortal
combat
,
that
caitif
barber
who
hath
leave
me
in
this
piteous
condition
;
and
I
vow
by
the
peacock
,
that
I
will
not
shave
my
beard
,
until
I
have
shave
his
head
from
his
shoulder
:
<EOS>
so
may
I
thrive
in
the
occupation
of
an
arrant
squire

"
   
<EOS>
before
his

have
time
to
enquire
into
particular

they
be
join
by
a
decent
man
in
boot
,
who
be
likewise
a
traveller
,
and
have
see
the
rise
and
progress
of
Timothy

disaster
.
<EOS>
He
give
the
knight
to
understand
,
that
Crabshaw
have
send
for
a
barber
,
and
already
undergo
one
half
of
the
operation
,
when
the
operator

the
long
expect
message
from
both

who

<EOS>
the
double
summon
be
no
sooner
intimate
to
him
,
than
he
throw
down
his
bason
and
retire
with
precipitation
,
leave

<EOS>
Timothy

on
pain
of
the
bastinado

<EOS>
the
other

himself
thus
arrest
,
and
have
no
time
to
spare
for
altercation
,
lift
up
his
fist
,
and
discharge
it
upon
the
snout
of
Crabshaw
with
such
force
,
that
the
unfortunate
aggressor
be
fain
to
bite
the
ground
,
while
the
victor
hasten
away
,
in
hope
of
touch
the
double
wage
of
corruption

<EOS>
the

be
inform
of
these
circumstance
,
tell
Timothy
with
a
smile
,
that
he
should

such

<EOS>
after

he
thus
resume
his
discourse
:
   
<EOS>
"
when
such
a
caitif
present
himself
to
you

like
the
devil

with
a
temptation

avoid
him

the

<EOS>
it
be
not

for
what
should
induce
him

he
be
an
utter
stranger
?
<EOS>
alas

<EOS>
it
be
not
a
benevolence
,
but
a
bribe
.
<EOS>
He
want
to
buy
you
at
one
market
,
that
he
may
sell
you
at
another
.
<EOS>
without
doubt
his
intention
be
to
make
an
advantage
of
his
purchase
;
and
this
aim
he
can
not
accomplish
,
but
by
sacrifice
,
in
some
sort
,
your
interest
,
your
independency
,
to
the
wicked
design
of
a

as
he
can
expect
no
gratification
for
the
faithful
discharge
of
his
duty
.
   
<EOS>
but
,
even
if
he
should
not
find
an
opportunity
of
sell
you
to
advantage
,
the
crime
,
the
shame
,
the
infamy
,
will
still
be

baser

sell
yourself

your

for

"
   
the
doctrine

be
a
very
unpopular
subject
in
such
an

and
,
accordingly
,
they
reject
it
as
one

<EOS>
They
begin
to
think

a
supposition

incense
both

the

<EOS>
They
hiss

they

they
annoy

so

,
he
brandish
his
lance
,
and
ride
into
the
thick

the
concourse
,
lay
about
him
with
such

the
half

mown
crop

<EOS>
in
this
commotion
he
lose

while

pelt
him
in
such
a

he
look

Crabshaw
think

but
his

mingle
with
the
crowd
,
and
hear
the
orator
express
himself
to
this
effect
:
"
very
likely

you

undervalue

these

if

<EOS>
take
notice

I
do

they

intoxicate
her

the

whence
all
other
being
derive
their
existence

as
proceed
from
their
father
the

and
their
mother
the
moon
;
from
the
sun
,
as
from
a
living

spiritual
gold
,
which
be
mere
fire

consequently
,
the
common

universal
first
create
mover
,
from
whence
all
moveable
thing
have
their
distinct

particular
motion
;

also
from

as
from
the
wife
of
the
sun

the

mother
of
all
sublunary
thing
:
and
for
as
much
as

be

must
be
the
comprehensive
end

all

he

buy
gold
that
be
thoroughly

rather
pure
fire

as
,
on

he

so

He
tell

that
notwithstanding
all
his

remonstrance
,
captain
Crowe
insist
upon
appear
in
the
character
of
a
knight
-
errant
;
and
with
that
view
have
set
out
from
the
public
-
house
on
the
morning
that
succeed
his
vigil
in
the
church
:
that
upon
the
high

way
they
have
meet
with
a
coach
,
contain
two
lady
,
one
of
whom
seem
to
be
under
great
agitation
;
for
,
as
they
pass
,
she
struggle
with
the
other
,
thrust
out
her
head
at
the
window
,
and
say
something
which
he
could
not
distinctly
hear
;
that
captain
Crowe
be
strike
with
admiration
of
her
unequalled
beauty
;
and
he
,
(
Tom
)
no
sooner
inform
him
who
she
be
,
than
he
resolve
to
set
her
at
liberty
,
on
the
supposition
that
she
be
under
restraint
and
in
distress
:
that
he
accordingly
unsheathe
his
cutlass
,
and
ride
back
after
the
coach
,
command
the
driver
to
bring
to
,
on
pain
of
death
:
that
one
of
the
servant
believe
the
captain
to
be
an
highwayman
,
present
a
blunderbuss
,
and
in
all
probability
would
have
shoot
him
on
the
spot

have
not
he
(
the

ride
up

assure
them
the

notwithstanding
his
intimation

all
the
three
attack
him
with
the
butt
end

their
horse

whip
,
while
the
coach
drive
on

and
although
he
lay
about
him
with
great
fury
,
at
last
bring
him
to
the
ground
by
a
stroke
on
the
temple
:
that
Mr
Clarke
himself
then
interpose
in
defence
of
his

be
also
severely
beat

two
of

have
grant
a
warrant
against

without
examination

commit
them
as
idle
vagrant

seize

their
money

their

<EOS>
but
,
as
there
be
no
just
cause
of
suspicion

(
add
he

<EOS>
I
be
of
opinion
,
the
justice
be
guilty
of
a
trespass
,

may
be
sue
for
falsum
imprisonamentum
,
and
considerable
damage
obtain
;
for
you
will
please
to
observe
,
Sir
,
no
justice
have
a
right
to
commit
any
person

till
after
due
examination
;
besides
,
we
be
not
commit
for
an
assault

battery

audit

nor
as
wander
lunatic
by
the
statute

who
,
to
be
sure

may
be
apprehend
by
a
justice
's
warrant
,

lock
up
and
chain
,
if
necessary
,
or
to
be
send
to
their
last
legal
settlement
:
but
we
be
commit
as
vagrant
and
suspect
highwayman
.
   
<EOS>
now
we
do
not
fall
under
the
description
of
vagrant
;
nor
do
any
circumstance
appear
to
support
the
suspicion
of
robbery
;
for
to
constitute
robbery
,
there
must
be
something
take
;
but
here
nothing
be
take
but
blow
,
and
they
be
upon
compulsion
:
even
an
attempt
to
rob
,
without
any
taking
,
be
not
felony
,
but
a
misdemeanor
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
there
be
a
taking
in
deed
,
and
a
taking
in
law
:
<EOS>

still
the
robber
must
be
in
possession
of
a
thing
steal

we
attempt

steal
ourselves
away

both
from

and
circumstance
of

the
meaning
of
his
own
detention

be
inform
in
this
last
particular
,

his
dialogue
with
the
turnkey
,
who
tell
him
,
through
the
grate
,
that
ferret

sooner

him
in
the
jail
,
without
his
offensive
arm
,
which
he
have
leave
below
,
than
he
desire
to
be
carry
before
the
justice
,
where
he
have
give
information
against
the
knight
,
as
a
violator
of
the
public
peace
,
who
stroll
about
the
country
with
unlawful
arm
,
render
the
highway
unsafe
,
encroach
upon
the
freedom
of
election
,
put
his
majesty
's
liege
subject
in
fear
of
their
life
,
and
<EOS>
,
in
all
probability
,
harbour
more
dangerous
design
under
an
affected
cloak
of
lunacy
.
<EOS>
ferret
,
upon
this
information
,
have
be
release
,
and
entertain
as
an
evidence
for
the
king
;
and
Crabshaw
be
put
in
the
stock
,
as
an
idle
stroller
.
   
<EOS>
Sir
Launcelot
,
be
satisfied
in
these
particular
,
address
himself
to
his
fellow
-
prisoner
,
and
beg
they
would
communicate
what
they
know
respect
the
worthy
magistrate
,
who
have
be
so
premature
in
the
execution
of
his
office
.
<EOS>
this
request
be
no
sooner
signify
than
a
crew
of
naked
wretch
crowd
around
him
;
and
,
like
a
congregation
of
rook
,
open
their
throat
all
at
once
,
in
accusation
of
justice
Gobble
.
   
<EOS>
the
knight
be
move
at
this
scene
,
which
he
could
not
help
compare
,
in
his
own
mind
,
to
what
would
appear
upon
a
much
more
awful
occasion
,
when
the
cry
of
the
widow
and
the
orphan
,
the
injure
and
oppress
,
would
be
utter
at
the
tribunal
of
an
unerring
Judge
against
the
villainous
and
insolent
author
of
their
calamity
.
   
<EOS>
when
he
have
,
with
some
difficulty
,
quiet
their
clamour
,
and
confine
his
interrogation
to
one
person
of
a
tolerably
decent
appearance
,
he
learn
that
justice
Gobble
,
whose
father
be
a
taylor
,
have
for
some
time
serve
as
a
journeyman
hosier
in
London
,
where
he
have
pick
up
some
law
-
term
,
by
converse
with
hackney
-
writer
and
attorney
clerk
of
the
low
order
;
that
,
upon
the
death
of
his
master
,
he
have
insinuate
himself
into
the
good
grace
of
the
widow
,
who
take
him
for
her
husband
,
so
that
he
become
a
person
of
some
consideration
,
and
save
money
apace
;
that
his
pride
,
increase
with
his
substance
,
be
reinforce
by
the
vanity
of
his
wife
,
who
persuade
him
to
retire
from
business
,
that
they
may
live
genteelly
in
the
country
;
that
his
father
die
,
and
leave
a
couple
of
house
in
this
town
,
Mr
Gobble
have
come
down
with
his
lady
to
take
possession
,
and
like
the
place
<EOS>
so
well
as
to
make
a
more
considerable
purchase
in
the
neighbourhood
;
that
a
certain
peer
be
indebte
to
him
in
the
large
way
of
his
business
,
and
either
unwilling
or
unable
to
pay
the
money
,
have
compound
the
debt
,
by
insert
his
name
in
the
commission
;
since
which
period
his
own
insolence
,
and
his
wife
's
ostentation
,
have
exceed
all
bound
:
that
,
in
the
exertion
of
his
authority
,
he
have
commit
a
thousand
act
of
cruelty
and
injustice
against
the
poor
sort
of
people
,
who
be
unable
to
call
him
to
a
proper
account
:
that
his
wife
domineer
with
a
more
ridiculous
,
though
less
pernicious
usurpation
,
among
the
female
of
the
place
:
that
,
in
a
word
,
she
be
the
subject
of
continual
mirth
,
and
he
the
object
of
universal
detestation
.
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
,
though
extremely
well
disposed
to
believe
what
be
say
to
the
prejudice
of
gobble
,
would
not
give
intire
credit
to
this
description
,
without
first
inquire
into
the
particular
of
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
ask
the
speaker
,
what
be
the
cause
of
his
particular
complaint
.
"
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
Sir

(
say
he
)
<EOS>
I
live
in
repute
,
and
keep
a
shop
in
this
here
town

well
furnish
with
a
great
variety
of
article

<EOS>
all
the
people
in
the
place
be
my
customer
;
but
what
I
and
many
other
chiefly
depend
upon
,
be
the
extraordinary
sale
at
two
annual
customary
fair
,
to
which
all
the
country
people
in
the
neighbourhood
resort
to
lay
out
their
money
.
<EOS>
I
have
employ
all
my
stock
,
and
even
engage
my
credit
to
procure
a
large
assortment
of
good
for
the
Lammas
-
market
:
but
have
give
my
vote
,
in
the
election
of
a
vestry
-
clerk
,
contrary
to
the
interest
of
justice
gobble
,
he
resolve
to
work
my
ruin
.
<EOS>
He
suppress
the
annual
fair
,
by
which
a
great
many
people
,
especially
publican
,
earn
the
good
part
of
their
subsistence

<EOS>
the
country
people
resort
to
another
town

<EOS>
I
be
overstock
with
a
load
of
perishable
commodity
;
and
find
myself
deprive
of
the
good
part
of
my
home
customer
by
the
ill
-
nature
and
revenge
of
the
justice
,
who
employ
all
his
influence
among
the
common
people
,
make
use
of
threat
and
promise
,
to
make
them
desert
my
shop
,
and
give
their
custom
to
another
person
,
whom
he
settle
in
the
same
business
under
my
nose

<EOS>
be
thus
disabled
from
make
punctual
payment
,
my
commodity
spoil
,
and
my
wife
break
her
heart
,
I
grow
negligent
and
careless
,
take
to
drinking
,
and
my
affair
go
to
wreck
.
<EOS>
be
one
day
in
liquor
,
and
provoke
by
the
fleer
and
taunt
of
the
man
who
have
set
up
against
me
,
I
strike
him
at
his
own
door
;
upon
which
I
be
carry
before
the
justice

who
treat
me
with
such
insolence
,
that
I
become
desperate
,
and
not

abuse
him
in
the
execution
of
his
office
,
but
also
make
an
attempt
to
lay
violent
hand
upon
his
person

<EOS>
You
know
,
Sir
,
when
a
man
be
both
drunk
and
desperate
,
he
can
not
be
suppose
to
have
any
command
of

<EOS>
I
be
send
hither
to
jail

<EOS>
My
creditor

seize
my

and
,
as
they
be
not
sufficient
to
discharge
my
debt
,
a
statute
of
bankruptcy
be
take
out
against
me
:
so
that
here
I
must
lie
,
until
they
think
proper
to
sign
my
certificate
,
or
the
parliament
shall
please
to
pass
an
act
for
the
relief
of
insolvent

the
next
person
who
present
himself
in
the
croud
of
accuser

a
meagre
figure

with
a
green
apron

who
tell
the
knight
that
he
have
keep
a
public
house
in
town
for
a
dozen
year
,
and
enjoy
a
goodtrade
,
which
be
in
a
great
measure
owe
to
a
skittle
-
ground
,
in
which
the
good
people
of
the
place
divert
themselves
occasionally
:
that
justice
Gobble
,
be
disoblige
at
his
refusing
to
part
with
a
gelding
which
he
have
breed
for
his

his
house
open

he
take
care
that
he
should
be
deprive

on
pretence
that
the
number
of

<EOS>
the

arrear
with
her
landlord
,
and
the
prospect
of
bankruptcy
aggravate
her
affliction
,
while
it
add
to
her
incapacity
.
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
these
diastrous
circumstance
,
news
arrive
that
her
son
Greaves
have
lose
his
life
in
a
sea
-
engagement
with
the
enemy
;
and
these
tiding
almost
instantly
deprive
her
of
her
reason
.
<EOS>
then
the
landlord
seize
for
his
rent
;
and
she
be
arrest
at
the
suit
of
justice
Gobble
,
who
have
buy
up
one
of
her
debt
,
in
order
to
distress
her
,
and
now
pretend
that
her
madness
be
feign
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
name
of
greave
be
mention
our
adventurer
start
,
and
change
colour
;
and
,
now
the
story
be
end
,
ask
,
with
mark
of
eager
emotion
,
if
the
name
of
the
woman
's
first
husband
be
not
Wilford
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
prisoner
answer
in
the
affirmative
,
he
rise
up
,
and
strike
his
breast
,
"
Good
heaven
!
<EOS>
(
cry
he
)
<EOS>
the
very
woman
who
watch
over
my
infancy
,
and
even
nourish
me
with
her
milk
!
  
<EOS>
She
be
my
mother
's
humble
friend
.
  
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
poor
Dorothy
!
<EOS>
how
would
your
old
mistress
grieve
to
see
her
favourite
in
this
miserable
condition
!
<EOS>
"
while
he
pronounce
these
word
,
to
the
astonishment
of
the
hearer
,
a
tear
stole
softly
down
each
cheek
.
<EOS>
then
he
desire
to
know
if
the
poor
lunatic
have
any
interval
of
reason
;
and
be
give
to
understand
,
that
she
be
always
quiet
,
and
generally
suppose
to
have
the
use
of
her
sense
,
except
when
she
be
disturb
by
some
extraordinary
noise
,
or
when
any
person
touch
upon
her
misfortune
,
or
mention
the
name
of
her
oppressor
,
in
all
which
case
she
start
out
into
extravagance
and
frenzy
.
<EOS>
They
likewise
impute
great
part
of
the
disorder
to
the
want
of
quiet
,
proper
food
,
and
necessary
,
with
which
she
be
but
poorly
supply
by
the
cold
hand
of
chance
charity
.
   
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
be
exceedingly
affect
by
the
distress
of
this
woman
,
whom
he
resolve
to
relieve
;
and
in
proportion
as
his
commiseration
be
excited
,
his
resentment
rise
against
the
miscreant
,
who
seem
to
have
insinuate
himself
into
the
commission
of
the
peace
on
purpose
to
harrass
and
oppress
his
fellow
-
creature
.
<EOS>
thus
animate
,
he
enter
into
consultation
with
Mr
Thomas
Clarke
concern
the
step
he
should
take
,
first
for
their
deliverance
,
and
then
for
prosecute
and
punish
the
justice
.
<EOS>
in
result
of
this
conference
,
the
knight
call
aloud
for
the
jaylor
,
and
demand
to
see
a
copy
of
his
commitment
,
that
he
may
know
the
cause
of
his
imprisonment
,
and
offer
bail
;
or
,
in
case
that
should
be
refuse
,
move
for
a
writ
of
Habeas
Corpus
.
<EOS>
the
jaylor
tell
him
the
copy
of
the
writ
should
be
forthcoming
;
but
after
he
have
wait
some
time
,
and
repeat
the
demand
before
witness
,
it
be
not
yet
produce
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Clarke
then
,
in
a
solemn
tone
,
give
the
jaylor
to
understand
,
that
an
officer
,
refuse
to
deliver
a
true
copy
of
the
commitment
warrant
,
be
liable
to
the
forfeiture
of
one
hundred
pound
for
the
first
offence
;
and
for
the
second
to
a
forfeiture
of
twice
that
sum
,
besides
be
disable
from
execute
his
office
.
   
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
no
easy
matter
to
comply
with
Sir
Launcelot
's
demand
;
for
no
warrant
have
be
grant
,
nor
be
it
now
in
the
power
of
the
justice
to
remedy
this
defect
,
as
Mr
Ferret
have
take
himself
away
privately
,
without
have
communicate
the
name
and
designation
of
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
a
circumstance
the
more
mortifying
to
the
jaylor
,
as
he
perceive
the
extraordinary
respect
which
Mr
Clarke
and
the
captain
pay
to
the
knight
,
and
be
now
fully
convinced
that
he
would
be
deal
with
accord
to
law
.
   
<EOS>
disorder
with
these
reflection
,
he
impart
them
to
the
justice
,
who
have
in
vain
cause
search
to
be
make
for
Ferret
,
and
be
now
extremely
well
inclined
to
set
the
knight
and
his
friend
at
liberty
,
though
he
do
not
at
all
suspect
the
quality
and
importance
of
our
adventurer
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
,
however
,
resist
the
temptation
of
display
the
authority
of
his
office
;
and
therefore
order
the
prisoner
to
be
bring
before
his
tribunal
,
that
,
in
the
capacity
of
a
magistrate
,
he
may
give
them
a
severe
reproof
,
and
proper
caution
,
with
regard
to
their
future
behaviour
.
   
<EOS>
They
be
accordingly
lead
thro
'
the
street
in
procession
,
guard
by
the
constable
and
his
gang
,
follow
by
Crabshaw
,
who
have
by
this
time
be
release
from
the
stock
,
and
surround
by
a
crowd
of
people
,
attract
by
curiosity
.
   
<EOS>
when
they
arrive
at
the
justice
's
house
,
they
be
detain
for
some
time
in
the
passage
:
then
a
voice
be
hear
,
command
the
constable
to
bring
in
the
prisoner
,
and
they
be
introduce
to
the
hall
of
audience
,
where
Mr
Gobble
sit
in
judgment
,
with
a
crimson
velvet
night
-
cap
on
his
head
;
and
on
his
right
hand
appear
his
lady
,
puff
up
with
the
pride
and
insolence
of
her
husband
's
office
,
fat
,
frowzy
,
and
not
over
-
clean
,
well
stricken
in
year
,
without
the
least
vestige
of
an
agreeable
feature
,
have
a
rubicond
nose
,
ferret
eye
,
and
imperious
aspect
.
<EOS>
the
justice
himself
be
a
little
,
affected
,
pert
prig
,
who
endeavour
to
solemnize
his
countenance
by
assume
an
air
of
consequence
,
in
which
pride
,
impudence
,
and
folly
be
strangely
blend
.
<EOS>
He
aspire
at
nothing
so
much
as
the
character
of
an
able
spokesman
;
and
take
all
opportunity
of
hold
forth
at
vestry
and
quarter
-
session
,
as
well
as
in
the
administration
of
his
office
in
private
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
,
therefore
,
let
slip
this
occasion
of
excite
the
admiration
of
his
hearer
,
and
,
in
an
authoritative
tone
,
thus
address
our
adventurer
:
   
<EOS>
"
the
law
of
this
land
have
provide
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
as
how
provision

,
in
reverence
to

,
whereby
the
king
's
peace
be
upholden
by
we

who
represent
his

well
than
in
e'er
a
contagious

<EOS>
but
,
howsoemever
,
that
there
king
's
peace
,
and
this
here
magistrate
's
authority
,
can
not
be
adequably
and
identically
upheld
,
if
so
be
as
how
criminal

unpunished

<EOS>
now
,
friend
,
you
must
be
confidentious
in
your
own
mind
,
as
you
be
a
notorious
criminal
,
who
have
trespass
again
the
law
on
diver
occasion
and
importunity
;
if
I
have
a
mind
to
exercise
the
rigour
of

accord
to
the
authority
wherewith
I
be
weste
,
you
and
your

would
be
sewerely

by
the
statue
:
but
we
magistrate
have
a
power
to
litigate
the
sewerity
of
justice
,
and
so
I
be
contented
that
you
should
be
mercifully
delt
withal
,
and
even
dismiss
.

"
   
<EOS>
to
this
harangue
the
knight

,
with
solemn
and
deliberate
accent
,
"
if
I
understand
your
meaning
aright
,
I
be
accuse
of
be
a
notorious
criminal
;
but
nevertheless
you
be
contented
to
let
me
escape
with
impunity
.
   
<EOS>
if
I
be
a
notorious
criminal
,
it
be
the
duty
of
you
,
as
a
magistrate
,
to
bring
me
to
condign
punishment
;
and
if
you
allow
a
criminal
to
escape
unpunished
,
you
be
not
only
unworthy
of
a
place
in
the
commission
,
but
become
accessary
to
his
guilt

to
all
intent

<EOS>
with
respect
to

I
shall
decline

<EOS>
I
understand
that
you
have
be
long
hackneye
in
the
way
of
oppression

and
I
have
see
some

I
myself
have

I
have

with
indignity

afterwards

I
now

however

Our

thank
him
for
this
instance

he
tell

he

contrary

during

the

have
hear
of

an

be
seize

such
pang

terror

compunction

as
a
grovel
mind
may
be
suppose
to
have
feel
in
such
circumstance
;
and
they
seem
to
produce
the

unsavoury
effect
that
be
so
humorously
delineate
by
the
inimitable
Hogarth
in
the
print
of
Felix

nevertheless

see

recollect
himself
so
far

themselves
any
further

release

then
discard
all

beg
the

ten
thousand
pardon
for
the
freedom

<EOS>
thank
God

what

that

<EOS>
sure
we
know
how

<EOS>
Mr

,
thank
be
to
God

can
defy
the
whole
world
to
prove
that
he
ever
say
an
uncivil
word
,
or
do
a
rude
thing
to
a
gentleman
,
know
him
to
be
a
person
of

<EOS>
indeed
,
as
to
your
poor
gentry
and
riff
-
raff
,
your
tag
,
rag
,
and
bobtail
,
or
such
vulgar
scoundrelly
people
,
he
have
always
behave
like
a
magistrate

and
treat
them
with
the
rigger
of
authority
.
"
<EOS>
"
in
other
word
(
say
the
knight
)
,
he
have
tyrannize
over
the
poor

and
connive
at
the
vice
of
the

your

for
this
confession

<EOS>
then
burst
into

,
"
Husband

continue
she

,
if
you
have
the
soul
of

you
would
not
suffer
me
to
be
abuse
at
this
rate

you
would
not
sit
still
on

hear
your

call
such
contemptible
epitaph

<EOS>
who
care

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
at
this

Mr

return

his

more
serious

declare
that
he

<EOS>
here
Mr

interpose
,
observe
,
that
against

no

(

Clarke

there
be
no

action

the

,
for
contempt
of

attachment
may
be
have
against

"
<EOS>
with
these
word
advance
to
Mr
Clarke
,
he
shake
him
by
the
hand
,
with
the
appellation
of
Brother
,
say
,
"
I
doubt
the

cursed
hovel

"
<EOS>
Mr
gobble
himself
seem
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
.
<EOS>
He
change
colour
several
time
during
the
remark
which
the
lawyer
have
make
;
and
now
,
declare
that
the
gentleman
be
at
liberty
,
beg
,
in
the
most
humble
phrase
,
that
the
company
would
eat
a
bit
of
mutton
with
him
,
and
after
dinner
the
affair
may
be
amicably
compromise
.
   
<EOS>
to
this
proposal
our
adventurer
reply
,
in
a
grave
and
resolute
tone
,
"
if
your
acting
in
the
commission
as
a
justice
of
the
peace
concern
my
own
particular
only
,
perhaps
I
should
wave
any
further
inquiry
,
and
resent
your
insolence
no
other
way
but
by
silent
contempt
.
<EOS>
if
I
think
the
error
of
your
administration
proceed
from
a
good
intention
,
defeat
by
want
of
understanding
,
I
should
pity
your
ignorance
,
and
,
in
compassion
,
advise
you
to
desist
from
act
a
part
for
which
you
be
so
ill
qualified
:
but
the
preposterous
conduct
of
such
a
man
deeply
affect
the
interest
of
the
community
,
especially
that
part
of
it
which
,
from
its
helpless
situation
,
be
the
more
entitled
to
our
protection
and
assistance
.
<EOS>
I
be
moreover
convinced
,
that
your
misconduct
be
not
so
much
the
consequence
of
an
uninformed
head
,
as
the
poisonous
issue
of
a
malignant
heart
,
devoid
of
humanity
,
inflame
with
pride
,
and
rankle
with
revenge
.
<EOS>
the
common
prison
of
this
little
town
be
fill
with
the
miserable
object
of
your
cruelty
and
oppression
.
   
<EOS>
instead
of
protect
the
helpless
,
restrain
the
hand
of
violence
,
preserve
the
public
tranquility
,
and
act
as
a
father
to
the
poor
,
accord
to
the
intent
and
meaning
of
that
institution
of
which
you
be
an
unworthy
member
,
you
have
distress
the
widow
and
the
orphan
,
give
a
loose
to
all
the
insolence
of
office
,
embroil
your
neighbour
by
foment
suit
and
animosity
,
and
play
the
tyrant
among
the
indigent
and
forlorn
.
<EOS>
You
have
abuse
the
authority
with
which
you
be
invest
,
intaile
a
reproach
upon
your
office
,
and
,
instead
of
be
revere
as
a
blessing
,
you
be
detest
as
a
curse
among
your
fellow
-
creature
.
<EOS>
this
,
indeed
,
be
generally
the
case
of
low
fellow
,
who
be
thrust
into
the
magistracy
without
sentiment
,
education
,
or
capacity
.
   
<EOS>
among
other
instance
of
your
iniquity
,
there
be
now
in
prison
an
unhappy
woman
,
infinitely
your
superior
in
the
advantage
of
birth
,
sense
,
and
education
,
whom
you
have
,
even
without
provocation
,
persecute
to
ruin
and
distraction
,
after
have
illegally
and
inhumanly
kidnap
her
only
child
,
and
expose
him
to
violent
death
in
a
foreign
land
.
<EOS>
ah
caitiff
!
<EOS>
if
you
be
to
forego
all
the
comfort
of
life
,
distribute
your
mean
among
the
poor
,
and
do
the
severe
penance
that
ever
priestcraft
prescribe
,
for
the
rest
of
your
day
,
you
could
not
atone
for
the
ruin
of
that
hapless
family
;
a
family
through
whose
side
you
cruelly
and
perfidiously
stab
the
heart
of
an
innocent
young
woman
,
to
gratify
the
pride
and
diabolical
malice
of
that
wretched
low
-
breed
woman
,
who
now
sit
at
your
right
hand
as
the
associate
of
power
and
presumption
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
if
such
a
despicable
reptile
shall
annoy
mankind
with
impunity
;
if
such
a
contemptible
miscreant
shall
have
it
in
his
power
to
do
such
deed
of
inhumanity
and
oppression
,
what
avail
the
law
?
<EOS>
where
be
our
admire
constitution
,
the
freedom
,
the
security
of
the
subject
,
the
boasted
humanity
of
the
british
nation
?
   
<EOS>
Sacred
Heaven
!
<EOS>
if
there
be
no
human
institution
to
take
cognizance
of
such
atrocious
crime
,
I
would
listen
to
the
dictate
of
eternal
justice
,
and
,
arm
myself
with
the
right
of
nature
,
exterminate
such
villain
from
the
face
of
the
earth
!
"
   
<EOS>
these
last
word
he
pronounce
in
such
a
strain
,
while
his
eye
lighten
with
indignation
,
that
Gobble
and
his
wife
undergo
the
most
violent
agitation
;
the
constable
's
tooth
chatter
in
his
head
,
the
jailor
tremble
,
and
the
whole
audience
be
overwhelmed
with
consternation
.
   
<EOS>
after
a
short
pause
,
Sir
Launcelot
proceed
in
a
milder
strain
:
"
Thank
Heaven
,
the
law
of
this
country
have
exempt
me
from
the
disagreeable
task
of
such
an
execution

<EOS>
to
them
we
shall
have
immediate
recourse

in
three
separate

against
you
for
false
imprisonment

and
any
other

who
have
be
injure
by
your
arbitrary
and
wicked
proceeding
,
in
me
shall
find
a
warm
protector
,
until
you
shall
be
expunge
from
the
commission
with
disgrace
,
and
have
make
such
retaliation
as
your
circumstance
will
allow
for
the
wrong
you
have
do
the
community
.
"
   
<EOS>
in
order
to
complete
the
mortification
and
terror
of
the
justice
,
the
lawyer
,
whose
name
be
Fenton
,
declare
,
that
,
to
his
certain
knowledge
,
these
action
would
be
reinforce
with
diver
prosecution
for
corrupt
practice
,
which
have
lie
dormant
until
some
person
of
courage
and
influence
should
take
the
lead
against
justice
Gobble
,
who
be
the
more
dreaded
as
he
act
under
the
patronage
of
lord
Sharpington
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
fear
have
deprive
the
justice
and
his
helpmate
of
the
faculty
of
speech
.
<EOS>
They
be
indeed
almost
petrified
with
dismay
,
and
make
no
effort
to
speak
,
when
Mr
Fillet
,
in
the
rear
of
the
knight
,
as
he
retire
with
his
company
,
take
his
leave
of
them
in
these
word
:
   
"
and
now
,
Mr
Justice
,
to
dinner
with
what
appetite
you
may
.
"
   
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
,
though
warmly
invite
to
Mr
Fenton
's
house
,
repair
to
a
public
inn
,
where
he
think
he
should
be

and
depose

from
his
magistracy
,
to

of
all
the

whom
he
have

and
,
in

,
to
rescue
poor
Mrs

from
the
miserable
circumstance
in
which
she
be
involve

<EOS>
in
the
mean
time

during
which
many
sally

Their

by
a
loud
scream
from
the
kitchen

whither
Sir
Launcelot
immediately

with

<EOS>
there

<EOS>
to
this
salutation
the
youth

"
I
be
sorry
for

mistress

<EOS>
how
do

<EOS>
how

Sukey
Sedgemore

"
   
<EOS>
the
good
woman
of
the
house
could
not
help
shed
tear
at
these
interrogation
;
while
Sir
Launcelot
,
interpose
,
say
,
not
without
emotion
,
"
I
perceive
you

the
son
of
Mrs
Oakley

<EOS>
Your

but
in
me
you

<EOS>
perceive
that
the
young
man
eye
him
with
astonishment
,
he
give
him
to
understand
that
his
name
be
Launcelot
Greaves

<EOS>
Oakley
no
sooner
hear
these
word
pronounce
,
than
he
fall
upon
his
knee
,
and
seize
the
knight
's
hand
,
kiss
it
eagerly
,
cry
,
"
<EOS>
God
for
ever
bless
your

I

when

<EOS>
this
instance
of
filial
duty
bring
tear
into
the
eye
of
our
adventurer
,
who
assure
him
his
mother
should
be
carefully
attend
,
and
want
for
nothing
:
but
that
it
would
be
very
improper
to
see
her
at
present
,
as
the
surprize
may
shock
her
too
much
,
consider
that
she
believe

"
<EOS>
ey

we

"
<EOS>
"
Lord

(

<EOS>

<EOS>
what

d'ye

tell
a

<EOS>
Hurt
I
be
,
to
be
sure
;
but
that
do
not
signify
:
we
give
'em
as
good
as
they
bring
,
and
so
parted

<EOS>
well
,
if
so
be
I
can
not
see
mother

I
will
go
and
have
some
chat
with
Sukey

do
nothing

sigh
,
and
weep
,
and
pine
herself
into
a
decay

I
be
afraid

thou
ha'st
come
too
late
to
save
her
life

"
   
<EOS>
Oakley
's
heart
be
not
proof
against
this
information

<EOS>
burst
into
tear

he
exclaim
,
"
o

have
I
then

He
would
have

be
restrain
by

<EOS>
after
dinner
,
just
as
they
begin

Our

death
;
and
have
immediate
recourse
to
the
curate
of
the
parish
for
spiritual
consolation
.
   
<EOS>
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
task
that
now
remain

be
to
make
the
widow
Oakley
acquaint
with
her
good
fortune
,
in
such
a
manner

We

complacency

Mr

not

lay
it
down
as
a
maxim

that
knight

synonimous
term

that
madness
,
though
exhibit

must
continue

perversion

He
perceive
the
additional
impression

the
brain

have
sustain
,
from
the
happy
manner
in
which
the
benevolence
of
Sir

have
so
lately
operate

begin
to
fear
it
would
be
,
in
a
little
time
,
quite
necessary
to
have
recourse
to
a
commission
of
lunacy

which
may
not
only
disgrace
the
family
of

Crowes
,
but
also
tend
to
invalidate
the
settlement
which
the

already
make

Mr
Clarke

expatiate
upon

bad
consequence
that
would
attend
his
uncle
's
perseverance
in
the
execution
of
a
scheme
so
foreign
to
his
faculty

intreate
him
,
for
the
love
of
God

to
divert
him
from
his
purpose
,
either
by
argument

of

He

thou
art
expose

the
horrible
explosion
of

his

honest
Crowe
think
himself
scurvily

have

with
such
humility
of
veneration

,
after
an
incoherent
ejaculation

sea

oath

go
in
quest
of
his

in

acquaint

the
cruel
letter

have
receive
from
that
young

contain
a
formal
renunciation
of
his
attachment
,
so
unsuitable
to
the
whole
tenour
of

<EOS>
He
revolve
the
late
adventure
of
the
coach
,
and
the
declaration
of
Mr
Clarke
,
with
equal
eagerness
and
astonishment
;
and
be
seize
with
the
most
ardent
desire

unravel
a
mystery
so
interesting

the
predominant
passion

<EOS>
all
these
mingle
consideration
produce
a
kind

ferment

subside
into
a
profound
reverie

compound
of
hope

perplexity

from
this
trance
he
be
wake
by
the
arrival
of
his
squire

who
enter
the
room
with
the
blood
trickle
over
his
nose

stand
before
him
without
speak

<EOS>
when
the
knight
ask
whose
livery
be
that
he
wear

he

solemn
tone

the
appearance

his
majesty

honourable

wide

respect
to

of
that
humanity

delicate
regard

the
fair

sex

ought
to
prevail
in
the
breast

in
particular
dignifie

that
weak

more
amiable

immediate
duty
be
it
to
afford
them
security

defence

injury

violence

right
have
you

inn

may
be

disturb

quiet

above
all

what
motive

wanton
barbarity

could
prompt
you

his
sword
,

upon

soldier
to
draw
in
his
defence

the
reader
may
have
see
the
physiognomy
of

stockholder
at
Jonathan

when
the
rebel
be
at
Derby
,

the
feature
of
a
bard
when
accost
by

countenance
of
an
alderman
when
his
banker
stop
payment

if

have
see
either
of
these
phaenomena

he
may
conceive
the
appearance

now
exhibit
by
the
visage

the
ferocious
captain

the
naked
sword
of
Sir
Launcelot

before

far
from

unconscionable
length

stand
motianless

such
frolick

yourself
into
contempt

and
acquit
himself
in

the
knight
say
he
be
very
glad
,
for
the
honour
of
the
service
,
to
find
they
be
impostor
;
tho

they
deserve
to
be
chastise
for
arrogate
to
themselves
an
honourable
character
,
which
they
have
not
spirit
to

<EOS>
these
word
be
scarce

,
when
Mr
Clarke
approach
one
of
the
bravado
,
who
have
threaten
to
crop
his
ear
,
bestow
such
a
benediction
on
his
jaw
,
as
he
could
not
receive
without
immediate
humiliation

smart
from
his
break

head

his
want
of
supper
,
salute
the
other
with
a
Yorkshire
hug
,
that
lay
him
across
the
body
of
his
companion

<EOS>
in
a
word
,
the
two
pseudo

officer
be
very
roughly
handle
for
their
presumption
in
pretend
to
act
character
for
which
they
be
so
ill
qualified

<EOS>
while
Clarke
and
Crabshaw
be
thus
laudably
employ
,
the
two
young
lady
pass
through
the
kitchen
so
suddenly
,
that
the
knight
have
only
a
transient
glimpse
of
their
back
,
and
they
disappear
before
he
could
possibly
make
a
tender
of
his

<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
they
dread
nothing
so
much
as
their

take
the
first
opportunity
of
glide
into
the
chaise

some
time
wait

passage

Mr
Clarke
be
much
more
disconcerted

sudden
escape

eagerness

(
exclaim
the

with

one
of

I

become
her

I
would
never

see
a
pretty
creature

as
for
the

she
be
a
very
genteel
woman

whether
old

ugly

I
can
not

masque

I
have
just
time
to
salute
Dolly

ask
a
few
question

all
she
could
tell
me
be
,
that
the
masqued
lady

that
she

Dolly

become
suddenly
calm

begin
to
communicate
to

the
dialogue

have
pass
between

CHAPTER
XIV
<EOS>
which

,
that
a
man
can
not
always
sip
,
when
the
cup
be
at
his
lip

those
who

the
resentment

the
humiliation

the
hope

the

and
,
in
a
word
,
the
infinite
disquiet
of
love
,
will
be
able
to
conceive
the
sea
of
agitation
on
which
our
adventurer
be
toss
all
night
long
,
without
repose
or
intermission

<EOS>
sometimes
he
resolve
to
employ
all
his
industry
and
address
in
discover
the
place
in
which
Aurelia
be
sequestre
,
that
he
may
rescue
her
from
the
suppose
restraint
to
which
she
have
be
subject
.
<EOS>
but
,
when
his
heart
beat
high
with
the
anticipation
of
this
exploit
,
he
be
suddenly
invade
,
and
all
his
ardour
check
,
by
the
remembrance
of
that
fatal
letter
,
write
and
sign
by
her
own
hand
,
which
have
divorce
him
from
all
hope
,
and
first
unsettle
his
understanding
.
<EOS>
the
emotion
wake
by
this
remembrance
be
so
strong
,
that
he
leap
from
the
bed
,
and
,
the
fire
be
still
burn
in
the
chimney
,
light
a
candle
,
that
he
may
once
more
banquet
his
spleen
by
read
the
original
billet
,
which
,
together
with
the
ring
he
have
receive
from
Miss
Darnel
's
mother
,
he
keep
in
a
small
box
,
carefully
deposit
within
his
portmanteau
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
instantly
unlocked
,
he
unfold
the
paper
,
and
recite
the
content
in
these
word
:
   
"
<EOS>
Sir
,
oblige
as
I
be
by
the
passion
you
profess
,
and
the
eagerness
with
which
you
endeavour
to
give
me
the
most
convincing
proof
of
your
regard
,
I
feel
some
reluctance
in
make
you
acquaint
with
a
circumstance
,
which
,
in
all
probability
,
you
will
not
learn
without
some
disquiet
.
   
<EOS>
but
the
affair
be
become
so
interesting
,
I
be
compel
to
tell
you
,
that
however
agreeable
your
proposal
may
have
be
to
those
whom
I
think
it
my
duty
to
please
by
every
reasonable
concession
,
and
howsoever
<EOS>
you
may
have
be
flatter
by
the
seeming
complacency
with
which
I
have
hear
your
address
<EOS>
,
I
now
find
it
absolutely
necessary
to
speak
in
a
decisive
strain
,
to
assure
you
,
that
,
without
sacrifice
my
own
peace
,
I
can
not
admit
a
continuation
of
your
correspondence
;
and
that
your
regard
for
me
will
be
best
shew
by
your
desisting
from
a
pursuit
,
which
be
altogether
inconsistent
with
the
happiness
of
"
Aurelia
Darnel

"
   
<EOS>
have
pronounce
aloud
the
word
that
compose
this
dismission
,
he
hastily
replace
the
cruel
scroll
;
and
,
be
too
well
acquaint
with
the
hand
to
harbour
the
least
doubt
of
its
be
genuine
,
throw
himself
into
his
bed
in
a
transport
of
despair
,
mingle
with
resentment
;
<EOS>
during
the
predominancy
of
which
,
he
determine
to
proceed
in
the
career
of
adventure
,
and
endeavour
to
forget
the
unkindness
of
his
mistress
,
amidst
the
avocation
of
knight
-
errantry
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
resolution
that
govern
his
thought
,
when
he
rise
in
the
morning
,
order
Crabshaw
to
saddle
Bronzomarte
,
and
demand
a
bill
of
his
expence
.
   
<EOS>
before
these
order
could
be
execute
,
the
good
woman
of
the
house
,
enter
his
apartment
,
tell
him
,
with
mark
of
concern
,
that
the
poor
young
lady
,
Miss
Meadows
,
have
drop
her
pocket

book
in

next
chamber

where
it
be

who
now
present

<EOS>
Our
knight
,
have
call
in
Mrs
Oakley
and
her
son
as
witness
,
unfold
the
book
,
without
read
one
syllable
of
the
content
,
and
find
in
it
five
bank
-
note
,
amount
to
two
hundred
and
thirty
pound
.
<EOS>
perceiving
,
at
once
,
that
the
loss
of
this
treasure
may
be
attend
with
the
most
embarrassing
consequence
to
the
owner
,
and
reflect
that
this
be
a
case
which
demand
the
immediate
interposition
and
assistance
of
chivalry
,
he
declare
,
that
he
himself
would
convey
it
safely
into
the
hand
of
Miss
Meadows
;
and
desire
to
know
the
road
she
have
pursue
,
that
he
may
set
out
in
quest
of
her
,
without
a
moment
's
delay
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
without
some
difficulty
that
this
information
be
obtain
from
the
post
-
boy
,
who
have
be
enjoin
secrecy
by
the
lady
,
and
even
gratified
with
a
handsome
reward
for
his
promise
discretion
.
   
<EOS>
the
same
method
be
use
to
make
him
disgorge
his
trust
:
he
undertake
to
conduct
Sir
Launcelot
,
who
hire
a
post
-
chaise
for
dispatch
,
and
immediately
depart
,
after
have
direct
his
squire
to
follow
his
tract
with
the
horse
.
   
<EOS>
yet
,
whatever
haste
he
make
,
it
be
absolutely
necessary
for
the
reader
's
satisfaction
,
that
we
should
outstrip
the
chaise
,
and
visit
the
lady
before
his
arrival
.
<EOS>
We
shall
therefore
,
without
circumlocution
,
premise
,
that
Miss
Meadows
be
no
other
than
that
paragon
of
beauty
and
goodness
,
the
all

accomplish
Miss
Aurelia
Darnel

<EOS>
She
have
,
with
that
meekness
of
resignation
peculiar
to
herself
,
for
some
year
submit
to
every
species
of
oppression
which
her
uncle
's
tyranny
of
disposition
could
plan
,
and
his
unlimited
power
of
guardianship
execute
,
till
,
at
length
,
it
rise
to
such
a
pitch
of
despotism
as
she
could
not
endure
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
project
a
match
between
his
niece
and
one
Philip
Sycamore
,
Esq
;
a
young
man
who
possess
a
pretty
considerable
estate
in
the
North
Country
;
who
like
Aurelia
's
person
,
but
be
enamour
of
her
fortune
,
and
have
offer
to
purchase
Anthony
's
interest
and
alliance
with
certain
concession
,
which
could
not
but
be
agreeable
to
a
man
of
loose
principle

who
would
have
find
it
a
difficult
task
to
settle
the
account
of
his
wardship

accord
to
the
present
estimate

matrimonial
felicity
,
Sycamore
may
have
find
admittance
as
a
future
son
-
in
-
law
in
any
private
family
of
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
He
be
by
birth
a
gentleman
,
tall
,
straight
,
and
muscular
,
with
a
fair
,
sleek
,
unmeaning
face

that
promise
more
simplicity
than
ill

nature

<EOS>
His
education
have
not
be
neglect
,
and
he
inherit
an
estate
of
five
thousand
a
year
.
<EOS>
Miss
Darnel
,
however
,
have
penetration
enough
to
discover
and
despise
him
as
a
strange
composition
of
rapacity
and
profusion
,
absurdity
and
good
-
sense
,
bashfulness
and
impudence
,
self
-
conceit
and
diffidence
,
aukwardness
and
ostentation
,
insolence
and
good

nature

rashness
and
timidity

<EOS>
He
be
continually
surround
and
prey
upon
by
certain
vermin
call

captain

buffoon

who
shew
him
in
lead

string
like
a
suck
giant
,
rifle
his
pocket
without
ceremony
,
ridicule
him
to
his
face
,
traduce
his
character
,
and
expose
him
in
a
thousand
ludicrous
attitude
for
the
diversion
of
the
public
;
while
,
all
the
time
,
he
know
their
knavery
,
see
their
drift
,
detest
their
moral
,
and
despise
their
understanding
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
infatuate
by
indolence
of
thought
,
and
communication
with
folly
,
that
he
would
have
rather
suffer
himself
to
be
lead
into
a
ditch
with
company
,
than
be
at
the
pain
of
go
over
a
bridge
alone
;
and
involve
himself
in
a
thousand
difficulty
,
the
natural
consequence
of
an
error
in
the
first
concoction
,
which
,
though
he
plainly
see
it
,
he
have
not
resolution
enough
to
avoid
.
   
<EOS>
such
be
the
character
of
squire
Sycamore
,
who
profess
himself
the
rival
of
Sir
Launcelot
Greaves
in
the
good
grace
of
Miss
Aurelia
Darnel
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
in
this
pursuit
persevere
with
more
constancy
and
fortitude
,
than
he
ever
exert
in
any
other
instance
.
<EOS>
be
generally
needy
,
from
extravagance
,
he
be
stimulate
by
his
want
,
and
animate
by
his
vanity
,
which
be
artfully
instigate
by
his
follower
,
who
hope
to
share
the
spoil
of
his
success
.
<EOS>
these
motive
be
reinforce
by
the
incessant
and
eager
exhortation
of
Anthony
Darnel
,
who
,
see
his
ward
in
the
last
year
of
her
minority
,
think
there
be
no
time
to
be
lose
in
secure
his
own
indemnification
,
and
snatch
his
niece
for
ever
from
the
hope
of
Sir
Launcelot
,
whom
he
now
hate
with
redouble
animosity
.
   
<EOS>
Finding
Aurelia
deaf
to
all
his
remonstrance
<EOS>
,
proof
against
ill
-
usage
,
and
resolutely
averse
to
the
propose
union
with
Sycamore
,
he
endeavour
to
detach
her
thought
from
Sir
Launcelot
,
by
forge
tale
to
the
prejudice
of
his
constancy
and
moral
character
;
and
,
finally
,
by
recapitulate
the
proof
and
instance
of
his
distraction
,
which
he
particularize
with
the
most
malicious
exaggeration
.
   
<EOS>
in
spite
of
all
his
art
,
he
find
it
impracticable
to
surmount
her
objection
to
the
purpose
alliance
,
and
therefore
change
his
battery
.
<EOS>
instead
of
transfer
her
to
the
arm
of
his
friend
,
he
resolve
to
detain
her
in
his
own
power
by
a
legal
claim
,
which
would
invest
him
with
the
uncontrouled
management
of
her
affair
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
charge
of
lunacy
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
hope
to
obtain
a
commission
,
to
secure
a
jury
to
his
wish
,
and
be
appoint
sole
committee
of
her
person
,
as
well
as
steward
on
her
estate
,
of
which
he
would
then
be
heir
apparent
.
<EOS>
as
the
first
step
towards
the
execution
of
this
honest
scheme
,
he
have
subject
Aurelia
to
the
superintendency
and
direction
of
an
old
duenna
,
who
have
be
formerly
the
procuress
of
his
pleasure
;
and
hire
a
new
set
of
servant
,
who
be
give
to
understand
,
at
their
first
admission
,
that
the
young
lady
be
disorder
in
her
brain

impression
of
this
nature

easily
preserve
among
servant
,
when
the
master
of
the
family
think
his
interest
be
concern
in
support
the
imposture
.
<EOS>
the
melancholy
produce
from
her
confinement
,
and
the
vivacity
of
her
resentment
under
ill
-
usage
,
be
,
by
the
address
of
Anthony
,
and
the
prepossession
of
his
domestick
,
pervert
into
the
effect
of
insanity
;
and
the
same
interpretation
be
strain
upon
her
most
indifferent
word
and
action
.
<EOS>
the
tyding
of
Miss

and
soon

the
ear
of
Mr
Sycamore

<EOS>
from
his
knowledge
of
Anthony

disposition

he
suspect
the
truth
of
the

unwilling

such
a

as
it
be

from

he

with
the
advice
and

resolve
to
set
the
captive
at
liberty
,
in
full
hope
of
turn
the
adventure
to
his
own
advantage
:
for
he
argue
in
this
manner
:
   
<EOS>
"
if
she
be
in
fact
compos
mentis
,
her
gratitude
will
opetate
in
my
behalf
,
and
even
prudence
will
advise
her
to
embrace
the
proffer
asylum
from
the
villany
of
her
uncle
.
<EOS>
if
she
be
really
disorder
,
it
will
be
no
great
difficulty
to
deceive
her
into
a
marriage
,
and
then
I
become
her
trustee
of
course
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
plan
be
well
conceive
;
but
Sycamore
have
not
discretion
enough
to
keep
his
own
counsel
.
<EOS>
from
weakness
and
vanity
,
he
blab
the
design
,

Anthony

and
he
take
his
precaution
accordingly

<EOS>

in
his

and
consequently
unfit
for

the
violence
of
some
desperado
,
whom
he
know
to
be
the
satellite
of
Sycamore
,
he
prepare
a
private
retreat
for
his
ward
at
the
house
of
an
old

,
the

of
his
youth
,
whom
he

the
fiction
of

in
her

,
and
amuse
with
a
story
of

more
disagreeable
fate

and
conceive
doubt

idea
that

with
horror
and
affliction

<EOS>
when

assistance
,
they
resolve
to
approve
themselves
worthy
of
her
confidence

<EOS>
dolly
have
inliste
in

a
trusty

one
of

they

of
a
pleasant
park

in

she
may
be
indulge
with
the
privilege
of

.
<EOS>
the
event
justify
their
conception
:
on
the
very
first
day
of
their
watch
they
see
her
approach
,
accompany
by
her
duenna
.
<EOS>
dolly
and
her
attendant
immediately
tie
their
horse
to
a
stake
,
and
retire
into
a
thicket
,
which
Aurelia
do
not
fail
to
enter
.
<EOS>
dolly
forthwith
appear
,
and
,
take
her
by
the
hand
,
lead
her
to
the
horse
,
one
of

she
mount
in
the
utmost
hurry
and
trepidation
,
while
the
countryman
bind
the
duenna
with
a
cord
,
prepare

the
purpose
,
gag
her
mouth
,
and
tie
her
to
a
tree
,
where
he
leave
her
to
her

meditation
.
<EOS>
then
he
mount
before
Dolly

and
through

path
conduct

charge
to
an
inn
on
the
post

road
,
where
a
chaise
be
ready
for

.
   
<EOS>
as
he
refuse
to
proceed
farther
,
lest
his
absence
from
his
own
home
should
create
suspicion
,
Aurelia
reward
him
liberally
;
but
would
not
part
with
her
faithful
Dolly
,
who
,
indeed
,
have
no
inclination
to

:
such
an
affection
and
attachment
have
she
already
acquire
for
the
amiable
fugitive
,
though
she
know
neither
her
story
,
nor

<EOS>
Aurelia
think
proper
to
conceal
both
,
and
assume
the
fictitious
appellation
of
Meadows
,
until
she
should
be
better
acquaint
with
the
disposition
and
discretion
of
her
new
attendant
.
<EOS>
the
first
resolution
she
could
take
in
the
present
flutter
of
her
spirit
,
be
to
make
the
good
of
her
way
to
London
,
where
she
think
she
may
find
an
asylum
in
the
house
of
a
female
relation
,
marry
to
an
eminent
physician
,
know
by
the
name
of
Kawdle
.
<EOS>
in
the
execution
of
this
hasty
resolve
,
she
travel
at
a
violent
rate
,
from

Crowe
,
which
she

fail
to
introduce
Mr

with
such
a
favourable
representation
of
his

character
,
as

her

history
of
Sir

Greaves
be
a
theme
which
effectually
fix
the
attention
of
Aurelia
,
distract
as
her
idea
must
have

the
circumstance
of

for

how
far
soever
she

with
that
young
gentleman
,
she
be

of
such
indifferent
stuff
,
as
to
learn
without
emotion
the
calamitous
disorder
of
an
accomplished
youth
,
whose
extraordinary
virtue
she
could
not
but
revere
.
   
<EOS>
as
they
have
deviate
from

,
take
precaution
to
conceal
their
route
,
and
make
such

;
and
so
far
she
succeed
in
the
attempt
,
that
for
one
night
the
toil
of
travelling
be
intermit
.
<EOS>
this
recess
from
incredible
fatigue
,
be
a
pause
that
afford
our
adventurer
time
to
overtake
them
before
they
reach
the
metropolis
,
that
vast
labyrinth
,
in
which
Aurelia
may
have

<EOS>
It
be
in
the
afternoon
of

<EOS>
He

considerable
way
,
without
ever
dream
who
the
person
really

whom
he
thus
pursue

and
now
he
desire
to
speak
with
her
attendant
.
<EOS>
Dolly
be
not
a
little
surprised
to
see
Sir
Launcelot
Greaves
,
of
whose
character
she
have
conceive
a
very
sublime
idea
,
from
the
narrative
of
Mr
Thomas
Clarke
;
but
she
be
still
more
surprised
when
he
give

that
he

<EOS>
Miss

<EOS>
It
be
not
to

suppose
that
the
amiable
Aurelia
hear
unmove
such
a
message
from
a
person
,
whom
her
maid
discover
to
be
the
very
identical
Sir

an
interview
,

it
be
to

,
will
interest
the
curiosity
of
the

<EOS>
the
mind
of
the
delicate
Aurelia
be
strangely
agitate
by
the
intelligence
which
she
receive
,
with
her
pocket
-
book
,
from
Dolly
.
   
<EOS>
confound
as
she
be
by
the
nature
of
her
situation
,
she
at
once
perceive
that
she
could
not
,
with
any
regard
to
the
dictate
of
gratitude
,
refuse
comply
with
the
request
of
Sir

;
but
,
in
the
first
hurry
of

,
in
her

that
she

as
she

particular
reason

that
disguise
.
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
submit
to
this
preliminary
with
a
good
grace
,
as
he
have
nothing
in

but
the
injunction
of
his
order
,
and
the
duty
of
humanity
;
and
he

<EOS>
when

such
a
glow
of
health
and
vivacity
on
his
feature
,
which
be
naturally
elegant
and
expressive
,
that
we
will
venture
to
say
,
there
be
not
in
all
England
a
couple
that
excel
this
amiable

in
personal
beauty
and
accomplishment

<EOS>
Aurelia
shine
with
all
the
fabled
grace
of
nymph

goddess

and
to
Sir
Launcelot
may
be
apply
what
the
divine
poet
Ariosto

of
the
prince
Zerbino
:

his
respect
to
her

as
superior

yet
his
pleasure
would
receive
a
very
considerable
addition
,
if
she

be
pleased
to
withdraw
that
invidious
veil
,
that
he
may
have
a
glimpse
of
the

<EOS>
Aurelia

a
faultere
accent

"

say
she
)

I
owe
my
life
to
the
courage

humanity
of
Sir
Launcelot
Greaves

Would
to

our

with
great
emotion

<EOS>
She
be
the
friend
of
my
youth
,
the
kind
patroness
of
my
felicity

<EOS>
my
guardian
angel

me
when

engraven
on
my

"
   
<EOS>
while
he
pronounce
these
word
she
lift
her
handkerchief
to
her
fair
eye
,
and
,
after
some
pause
,
proceed
in
a
tremulous
tone
,
"
I
hope

Sir
  
I
hope
you

Sir

here
she
fetch
a
deep
sigh
,
that
be
accompany
with
a
flood
of
tear
;
while
the
knight
continue
to
bend
his
eye
upon
her
with
the
utmost
eagerness
of
attention

<EOS>
have
recollect
herself
a
little
,
she
endeavour
to
shift
the
conversation
:
"
You

abroad

the
pleasure
to

"
no

(
say
our
hero
,

his
head

I
have
be
unfortunate

"
when
she
,
with
the
most
enchanting
sweetness
of
benevolence
,
express
her
concern
to
hear
he
have
be
unhappy
,
and
her
hope
that
his
misfortune
be
not
past
remedy
;
he
lift
up
his
eye
,
and
fix
them
upon
her
again
with
a
look
of
tender
dejection
,
"
cut
off
(
say
he
)
from
the
possession
of
what
my
soul

<EOS>
the
tender
heart
of
Aurelia
could
bear
no
more
 
<EOS>
her
knee
begin
to
totter
:
the
lustre
vanish
from
her
eye
,
and
she
faint
in
the
arm
of
her
attendant

Sir
Launcelot

arouse
by
this
circumstance

assist
dolly
in

her
mistress
on
a
couch
,
where
she
soon
recover

the
knight
on
his
knee
before
her

melancholy
moment

<EOS>
so
say
,
he
gently
touch
her
hand
,
in
order
to
press
it
to
his
lip
,
and
perceive
on
her
finger
the
very
individual
ring

he
have
present
in

presence

as
an
interchanged

start
at

conjure
up
a

blush
at
this
remark

I

the
injury

imposition

what
else
but
Miss
Darnel
's
explicit

express
declaration
could
have
destroy
the
sweetest
hope

could
have
oblige
me
to
resign
all
claim

that
felicity

alone
<EOS>
I
wish

could
have

me
from

look
wistfully
at
her
lover

she
)

"
   
<EOS>
this
last
word
she
pronounce
with
some
hesitation
,
and
a
downcast
look
,
while
her
face
undergo
a
total
suffusion
,
and
the
knight
's
heart
begin
to
palpitate
with
all
the
violence
of
emotion

He
eagerly
imprint
a
kiss
upon

in
interrupted
phrase

companion

last
night
I
nourish
my
chagrin

the
perusal
of
its
horrid
content

"
   
<EOS>
Aurelia
express
great
impatience
to
view
the
cruel
forgery
;
for
such
she
assure
him
it
must
be
:
but
he
could
not
gratify
her
desire
till
the
arrival
of
his
servant
with
the
portmanteau
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
tea
be

<EOS>
the
lover
be

:
he
look
and
languish
;
she
flush
and
faultere

all
be
doubt
and
delirium
,
fondness
and
flutter

<EOS>
Their
mutual
disorder
communicate
itself
to
the
kind
-
hearted
sympathizing
Dolly
,
who
have
be
witness
to
the
interview
,
and
deeply
affected
with
the
disclosure
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
unspeakable
be
her
surprize
when
she
find
her
mistress
Miss
Meadows
be
no
other
than
the
celebrated
Aurelia
Darnel
,
whose
elogium
she
have
hear
so
eloquently
pronounce
by
her
sweet
-
heart
Mr
Thomas
Clarke
;
a
discovery
which
still
more
endear
her
lady
to
her
affection
.
   
<EOS>
She
have
weep
plentifully
at
the
progress
of
their
mutual
explanation
;
and
be
now
so
disconcert
,
that
she
scarce
know
the
meaning
of
the
order
she
have
receive
.
<EOS>
She
set
the
kettle
on
the
table
,
and
place
the
tea
-
board
on
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Her
confusion
,
by
attract
the
notice
of
her
mistress
,
help
to
relieve
her
from
her
own
embarrassing
situation
.
<EOS>
She
,
with
her
own
delicate
hand
,
rectify
the
mistake
of
Dolly
;
who
still
continue
to
sob
,
and
say
,
"

"
<EOS>
Sir
Launcelot
could
not
help
smile
at
the
simplicity
of
Dolly
,
whose
goodness
of
heart
and
attachment
,
Aurelia
do
not
fail
to
extol
,
as
soon
as
her
back
be
turn
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
consequence
of
this
commendation
,
that
,
the
next
time
she
enter
the
room
,
our
adventurer
,
for
the
first
time
,
consider
her
face
,
and
seem
to
be
strike
with
her
feature
.
   
<EOS>
He
ask
her
some
question
,
which
she
could
not
answer
to
his
satisfaction
,
applaud
her
regard
for
her
lady
,
and
assure
her
of
his
friendship
and
protection
.
<EOS>
He
now
beg
to
know
the
cause
that
oblige
his
Aurelia
to
travel
at
such
a
rate
,
and
in
such
an
equipage
;
and
she
inform
him
of
those
particular
which
we
have
already
communicate
to
the
reader
.
   
<EOS>
Sir
Launcelot
glow
with
resentment
,
when
he
understand
how
his
dear
Aurelia
have
be
oppress
by
her
perfidious
and
cruel
guardian
.
<EOS>
He
bite
his
nether
lip
,
roll
his
eye
around
,
start
from
his
seat
,
and
stride
across
the
room
,
"
I
remember
(
say
he
)
the
die
word
of
her
who
be
now
a
saint
in
heaven
  
"
<EOS>
that
violent
man
,
my
brother
-
in
-
law
,
who
be
Aurelia
's
sole
guardian
,
will
thwart
her
wish
with
every
obstacle
that
brutal
resentment
and
implacable
malice
can
contrive
.
"
  
<EOS>
what
follow
,
it
would
ill
become
me
to
repeat
:
but
she
conclude
with
these
word
 
<EOS>
"
the
rest
we
must
leave
to
the
dispensation
of
Providence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
be
it
not
Providence
that
send
me
hither
,
to
guard
and
protect
the
injure
Aurelia
?
"
<EOS>
then
turn
to
Miss
Darnel
,
whose
eye
stream
with
tear
,
he
add
,
"
yes
,
divine
creature
!
<EOS>
heaven
,
careful
of
your
safety
,
and
in
compassion
to
my
suffering
,
hath
guide
me
hither
,
in
this
mysterious
manner
,
that
I
may
defend
you
from
violence
,
and
enjoy
this
transition
from
madness
to
deliberation
,
from
despair
to
felicity
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
approach
this
amiable
mourner
,
this
fragrant
flower
of
beauty
,
glitter
with
the
dew
-
drop
of
the
morning
;
this
sweetest
,
and
gentle
,
lovely
ornament
of
human
nature
:
he
gaze
upon
her
with
look
of
love
ineffable
:
<EOS>
he
sit
down
by
her
;
he
press
her
soft
hand
in
his
;
he
begin
to
fear
that
all
he
see
be
the
flattering
vision
of
a
distemper
brain
.
<EOS>
He
look
and
sigh
;
and
turn
up
his
eye
to
heaven
,
breathe
,
in
broken
murmur
,
the
chaste
rapture
of
his
soul
.
   
<EOS>
the
tenderness
of
this
communication
be
too
painful
to
be
long
endure
.
<EOS>
Aurelia
industriously
interpose
other
subject
of
discourse
,
that
his
attention
may
not
be
dangerously
overcharge
,
and
the
afternoon
pass
insensibly
away
.
   
<EOS>
though
he
have
determine
,
in
his
own
mind
,
never
more
to
quit
this
idol
of
his
soul
,
they
have
not
yet
concert
any
plan
of
conduct
,
when
their
happiness
be
all
at
once
interrupt
by
a
repetition
of
cry
,
denote
horror
;
and
<EOS>
a
servant
,
come
in
,
say
he
believe
some
rogue
be
murder
a
traveller
on
the
highway
.
<EOS>
the
supposition
of
such
distress
operate
like
gunpowder
on
the
disposition
of
our
adventurer
,
who
,
without
consider
the
situation
of
Aurelia
,
and
indeed
without
see
,
or
be
capable
to
think
on
her
,
or
any
other
subject
,
for
the
time
being
,
run
directly
to
the
stable
,
and
mount
the
first
horse
which
he
find
saddle
,
issue
out
in
the
twilight
,
have
no
other
weapon
but
his
sword
.
   
<EOS>
He
ride
full
speed
to
the
spot
whence
<EOS>
the
cry
seem
to
proceed
;
but
they
sound
more
remote
as
he
advance
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
he
follow
them
to
a
considerable
distance
from
the
road
,
over
field
,
ditch
,
and
hedge
;
and
at
last
come
so
near
,
that
he
could
plainly
distinguish
the
voice
of
his
own
squire
,
Timothy
Crabshaw
,
bellow
for
mercy
,
with
hideous
vociferation
.
<EOS>
stimulate
by
this
recognition
,
he
redouble
his
career
in
the
dark
,
till
at
length
his
horse
plunge
into
a
hole
,
the
nature
of
which
he
could
not
comprehend
;
but
he
find
it
impracticable
to
disengage
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
with
some
difficulty
that
he
himself
clamber
over
a
ruin
wall
,
and
regain
the
open
ground
.
<EOS>
here
he
grope
about
,
in
the
utmost
impatience
of
anxiety
,
ignorant
of
the
place
,
mad
with
vexation
for
the
fate
of
his
unfortunate
squire
,
and
between
while
invade
with
a
pang
of
concern
for
Aurelia
,
leave
among
stranger
,
unguarded
,
and
alarm
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
this
emotion
,
he
bethink
himself
of
hollow
aloud
,
that
,
in
case
he
should
be
in
the
neighbourhood
of
any
inhabited
place
,
he
may
be
hear
and
assist
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
practise
this
expedient
,
which
be
not
altogether
without
effect
;
for
he
be
immediately
answer
by
an
old
friend
,
no
other
than
his
own
steed
Bronzomarte
,
who
,
hear
his
master
's
voice
,
neigh
strenuously
at
a
small
distance
.
<EOS>
the
knight
,
be
well
acquaint
with
the
sound
,
hear
with
astonishment
;
and
,
advance
in
the
right
direction
,
find
his
noble
charger

to
a
tree

<EOS>
He
forthwith
untie
and
mount
him
;
then
,
lay
the
rein
upon
his
neck
,
allow
him
to
chuse
his
own
path
,
in
which
he
begin
to
travel
with
equal
steadiness
and
expedition
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
proceed
far
when
the
knight
's
ear
be
again
salute
by
the
cry
of
Crabshaw
;
which
Bronzomarte
no
sooner
hear
than
he
prick
up
his
ear
,
neigh
,
and
quicken
his
pace
,
as
if
he
have
be
sensible
of
the
squire
's
distress
,
and
hasten
to
his
relief
.
   
<EOS>
Sir
Launcelot
,
notwithstanding
his
own
disquiet
,
could
not
help
observe
and
admire
this
generous
sensibility
of
his
horse
:
he
begin
to
think
himself
some
hero
of
romance
mount
upon
a
wing
steed
,
inspire
with
reason
,
direct
by
some
humane
inchanter
,
who
pity
virtue
in
distress
.
<EOS>
all
circumstance
consider
,
it
be
no
wonder
that
the
commotion
in
the
mind
of
our
adventurer
produce
some
such
delirium
.
<EOS>
all
night
he
continue
the
chace
;
the
voice
,
which
be
repeat
at
interval
,
still
retreat
before
him
,
till
the
morning
begin
to
appear
in
the
East
,
when
,
by
diver
piteous
groan
,
he
be
direct
to
the
corner
of
a
wood
,
where
he
behold
his
miserable
squire
stretch
upon
the
grass
,
and
Gilbert
feed
by
him
altogether
unconcerned
,
the
helmet
and
the
launce
suspend
at
the
saddle
-
bow
,
and
the
portmanteau
safely
fix
upon
the
crupper
.
   
<EOS>
the
knight
,
ride
up
to
Crabshaw
,
with
equal
surprize
and
concern
,
ask
what
have
bring
him
there
;
and
Timothy
,
after
some
pause
,
during
which
he
survey
his
master
with
a
rueful
aspect
,
answer
,
"
the
devil
.
"
<EOS>
"
one
would
imagine

indeed
,

some
such
conveyance

Sir

<EOS>
but
,
say
,
what
damage
have
you
sustain
,
that
you
lie
in
that
wretched
posture
,
and
groan
so
dismally

"
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
guess

(
reply
the
squire
)
<EOS>
if
it
bean't
that

cry
the

<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing

answer
the
peevish
squire

but
that
I

torment
by
vive
houndred
and
vifty
thousand
legion
of
devil
,
and
there
be
an
end
oon't

"
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
must
have
a
little
patience

Crabshaw
 
there
be
a
salve
for
every

<EOS>
"

for
a

in
your

you
talk
very
much
at

if
you
can
get
up
and
mount
Gilbert
,
that
you
may
be

"
    
<EOS>
Timothy
actually
make
an
effort
to
rise
;
but
fall
down
again
,
and
utter
a
dismal
yell
.
<EOS>
then
his
master
exhort
him
to
take
advantage
of
a
park
-
wall
by
which
he
lie
,
and
raise
himself
gradually
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Crabshaw
,
eye
him
askance
,
say
,
by
way
of
reproach
,
for
his
not
alight
and
assist
him
in
person
,
"
thatch
your
house
with
t####d
,
and
you
will
have
more
teacher
,
than
reacher
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
have
pronounce
this
inelegant
adage
,
he
make
shift
to
stand
upon
his
leg
;
and
now
,
the
knight
lend
a
hand
,
be
mount
upon
Gilbert
,
though
not
without
a
world
of
oh
's
!
<EOS>
and
ah
be
!
<EOS>
and
other
ajaculation
of
pain
and
impatience
.
   
<EOS>
as
they
jog
on
together
,
our
adventurer
endeavour
to
learn
the
particular
of
the
disaster
which
have
befall
the
squire
;
but
all
the
information
he
could
obtain
amount
to
a
very
imperfect
sketch
of
the
adventure
.
<EOS>
by
dint
of
a
thousand
interrogation
he
understand
,
that
Crabshaw
have
be
,
in
the
precede
evening
,
encounter
by
three
person
on
horseback
with
venetian
masque
on
their
face
,
which
he
mistake
for
their
natural
feature
,
and
be
terrify
accordingly
:
that
they
not
only
present
pistol
to
his
breast
,
and
lead
his
horse
out
of
the
highway
;
but
prick
him
with
goad
,
and
pinch
him
,
from
time
to
time
,
till
he
scream
with
the
torture
:
that
he
be
lead
through
unfrequented
place
across
the
country
,
sometimes
at
an
easy
trot
,
sometimes
at
full
gallop
,
and
torment
all
night
by
those
hideous
daemon
,
who
vanish
at
day
-
break
,
and
leave
him
lie
on
the
spot
where
he
be
find
by
his
master
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
a
mystery
which
our
hero
could
by
no
means
unriddle
:
<EOS>
it
be
the
more
unaccountable
,
as
the
squire
have
not
be
rob
of
his
money
,
horse
,
and
baggage
.
<EOS>
He
be
even
dispose
to
believe
,
that
Crabshaw
's
brain
be
disorder
,
and
the
whole
account
he
have
give
,
no
more
than
a
chimera
.
<EOS>
this
opinion
,
however
,
he
could
no
longer
retain
,
when
he
arrive
at
an
inn
on
the
post
-
road
,
and
find
,
upon
examination
,
that
Timothy
's
low
extremity
be
cover
with
blood
,
and
all
the
rest
of
his
body
speckle
with
livid
mark
of
contusion
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
still
more
chagrined
when
the
landlord
inform
him
,
that
he
be
thirty
mile
distant
from
the
place
where
he
have
leave
Aurelia
,
and
that
his
way
lie
through
cross
-
road
,
which
be
almost
impassable
at
that
season
of
the
year
.
   
<EOS>
alarm
at
this
intelligence
,
he
give
direction
that
his
squire
should
be
immediately
convey
to
bed
in
a
comfortable
chamber
,
as
he
complain
more
and
more
;
and
indeed
be
seize
with
a
fever
,
occasion
by
the
fatigue
,
the
pain
,
and
terror
he
have
undergo
.
<EOS>
a
neighbouring
apothecary
being
call
,
and
give
it
as
his
opinion
that
he
could
not
for
some
day
be
in
a
condition
to
travel
,
his
master
deposit
a
sum
of
money
in
his
hand
,
desire
he
may
be
properly
attend
,
till
he
should
hear
further
.
<EOS>
then
mount
Bronzomarte
,
he
set
out
with
a
guide
for
the
place
he
have
leave
,
not
without
a
thousand
fear
and
perplexity
,
arise
from
the
reflection
of
have
leave
the
jewel
of
his
heart
with
such
precipitation

it
be
to
be

,
the

will
find
an
agreeable
medley
of
mirth
and
madness
,
sense
and
absurdity
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
without
reason
that
our
adventurer
afflict
himself
:
his
fear
be
but
too
prophetic
.
   
<EOS>
when
he
alight
at
the
inn
,
which
he
have
leave
so
abruptly
the
precede

he

<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
seasonable
than
the
delivery
of
this
billet
;
which
he
have
no
sooner
peruse
,
than
his
reflection
return
,
and
he
enter
into
a
serious
deliberation
with
his
own
heart
.
<EOS>
He
consider
that
Aurelia
be
by
this
time
far
beyond
a
possibility
of
be
overtake
;
and
that
by
a
precipitate
pursuit
he
should
only
expose
his
own
infirmity
.
<EOS>
He
confide
in
the
attachment
of
his
mistress
,
and
in
the
fidelity
of
her
maid
,
who
would
find
opportunity
of
communicate
her
sentiment
,
by
the
mean
of
this
lacquey
,
of
whom
he
perceive
by
the
letter
she
have
already
make
a
conquest
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
resolve
to
bridle
his
impatience
,
to
proceed
leisurely
to
London
,
and
,
instead
of
take
any
rash
step
which
may
induce
Anthony
Darnel
to
remove
his
niece
from
that
city
,
remain
in
seem
quiet
until
she
should
be
settle
,
and
her
guardian
return
to
the
country
.
   
<EOS>
Aurelia
have
mention
to
him
the
name
of
doctor
Kawdle
,
and
from
him
he
expect
,
in
due
time
,
to
receive
the
most
interesting
information
.
   
<EOS>
these
reflection
have
an
instantaneous
effect
upon
our
hero
,
whose
rage
immediately
subside
,
and
whose
visage
gradually
resume
its
natural
cast
of
courtesy
and
good
humour
.
<EOS>
He
forthwith
gratify
the
postilion
with
such
a
remuneration
as
send
him
dance
into
the
kitchen
,
where
he
do
not
fail
to
extol
the
generosity
and
immense
fortune
of
Sir
Launcelot
Greaves
.
   
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
's
next
step
be
to
see
Bronzomarte
properly
accommodate
;
then
he
order
a
refreshment
for
himself
,
and
retire
into
an
apartment
,
where
mine
host
with
his
wife
and
all
the
servant
wait
on
him
,
to
beseech
his
honour
to
forgive
their
impertinence
,
which
be
owe
to
their
ignorance
of
his
honour
's
quality
,
and
the
false
information
they
have
receive
from
the
gentleman
's
servant
.
<EOS>
He
have
too
much
magnanimity
to
retain
the
least
resentment
against
such
inconsiderable
object
.
   
<EOS>
He
not
only
pardon
them
without
hesitation
;
but
assure
the
landlord
he
would
be
accountable
for
the
horse
,
which
,
however
,
be
that
same
evening
bring
home
by
a
countryman
,
who
have
find
him
pound
as
it
be
within
the
wall
of
a
ruin
cottage
.
<EOS>
as
the
knight
have
be
greatly
fatigue
,
without
enjoy
any
rest
for
eight
and
forty
hour
,
he
resolve
to
indulge
himself
with
one
night
's
repose
,
and
then
return
to
the
place
where
he
have
leave
his
squire
indispose
:
for
by
this
time
even
his
concern
for
Timothy
have
recur
.
   
<EOS>
on
a
candid
scrutiny
of
his
own
heart
,
he
find
himself
much
less
unhappy
than
he
have
be
before
his
interview
with
Aurelia
;
for
,
instead
of
be
as
formerly
torment
with
the
pang
of
despair
love
,
which
have
actually
unsettle
his
understanding
,
he
be
now
happily
convinced
that
he
have
inspire
the
tender
breast
of
Aurelia
with
mutual
affection
;
and
though
she
be
invidiously
snatch
from
his
embrace
,
in
the
midst
of
such
endearment
as
have
wind
up
his
soul
to
extasy
and
transport
,
he
do
not
doubt
of
be
able
to
rescue
her
from
the
power
of
an
inhuman
kinsman
,
whose
guardianship
would
soon
of
course
expire
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
he
rest
with
the
most
perfect
dependence
on
her
constancy
and
virtue
.
   
<EOS>
as
he
next
day
cross
the
country
,
ruminate
on
the
disaster
that
have
befall
his
squire
,
and
could
now
compare
circumstance
coolly
,
he
easily
comprehend
the
whole
scheme
of
that
adventure
,
which
be
no
other
than
an
artifice
of
Anthony
Darnel
and
his
emissary
,
to
draw
him
from
the
inn
where
he
propose
to
execute
his
design
upon
the
innocent
Aurelia
.
   
<EOS>
He
take
it
for
grant
,
that
the
uncle
,
have
be
make
acquainted
with
his
niece
's
elopement
,
have
follow
her
track
by
the
help
of
such
information
as
he
receive
from
one
stage
to
another
;
and
that
,
receive
more
particular
at
the
White
Hart
touch
Sir
Launcelot
,
he
have
form
the
scheme
in
which
Crabshaw
be
an
involuntary
instrument
towards
the
seduction
of
his
master
.
   
<EOS>
amuse
himself
with
these
and
other
cogitation
,
<EOS>
our
hero
in
the
afternoon
reach
the
place
of
his
destination
;
and
enter
the
inn
where
Timothy
have
be
leave
at
sick
quarter
,
chance
to
meet
the
apothecary
retiring
precipitately
in
a
very
unsavoury
pickle
from
the
chamber
of
his
patient
.
<EOS>
when
he
enquire
about
the
health
of
his
squire
,
this
retainer
to
medicine
,
wipe
himself
all
the
while
with
a
napkin
,
answer
in
manifest
confusion
,
that
he
apprehend
him
to
be
in
a
very
dangerous
way
,
from
an
inflammation
of
the
pia
mater
,
which
have
produce
a
most
furious
delirium
.
<EOS>
then
he
proceed
to
explain
,
in
technical
term
,
the
method
of
cure
he
have
follow
;
and
conclude
with
tell
him
the
poor
squire
's
brain
be
so
outrageously
disorder
,
that
he
have
reject
all
administration
,
and
just
throw
an
urinal
in
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
the
knight
's
humanity
be
alarm
at
this
intelligence
,
he
resolve
that
Crabshaw
should
have
the
benefit
of
further
advice
,
and
ask
if
there
be
not
a
physician
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
the
apothecary
,
after
some
interjection
of
hesitation
,
own
there
be
a
doctor
in
the
village
,
an
odd
sort
of
a
humourist
;
but
he
believe
he
have
not
much
to
do
in
the
way
of
his
profession
,
and
be
not
much
use
to
the
form
of
prescription
.
<EOS>
He
be
count
a
scholar
,
to
be
sure
;
but
as
to
his
medical
capacity
,
  
he
would
not
take
upon
him
to
say
 
"
no
matter
,
(
cry
Sir
Launcelot
)
<EOS>
he
may
strike
out
some
lucky
thought
for
the
benefit
of
the
patient
;
and
I
desire
you
will
call
him
instantly
.
"
    
<EOS>
while
the
apothecary
be
absent
on
this
service
,
our
adventurer
take
it
in
his
head
to
question
the
landlord
about
the
character
of
this
physician
,
which
have
be
so
unfavourably
represent
,
and
receive
the
following
information
:
   
"
for
my
peart
,
measter
,
I
know
nothing
amiss
of
the
doctor
 
<EOS>
he
be
a
quiet
sort
of
an
inoffensive
man
;
use
my
house
sometimes
,
and
pay
for
what
he
have
,
like
the
rest
of
my
customer
.
<EOS>
They
say
he
deal
very
little
in
physic
stuff
,
but
cure
his
patient
with
fasting
and
water
-
gruel
,
whereby
he
can
not
expect
the
pothecary
to
be
his
friend
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
master
,
one
must
live
,
and
let
live
,
as
the
saying
be
.
<EOS>
I
must
say
,
he
,
for
for
the
value
of
three
guinea
,
set
up
my
wife
's
constitution
in
such
a
manner
,
that
I
have
save
within
these
two
year
,
I
believe
,
forty
pound
in
pothecary
's
bill
.
<EOS>
but
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
every
man
must
eat
,
tho'f
at
another
's
expence
;
and
I
should
be
in
a
deadly
hole
myself
,
if
all
my
customer
should
take
it
in
their
head
to
drink
nothing
but
water
-
gruel
,
because
it
be
good
for
the
constitution
.
   
<EOS>
thank
God
<EOS>
,
I
have
as
good
a
constitution
as
e'er
<EOS>
a
man
in
England
;
but
for
all
that
,
I
and
my
whole
family
bleed
and
purge
and
take
a
diet
drink
twice
a
-
year
,
by
way
of
serve
the
pothecary
,
who
be
a
very
honest
man
,
and
a
very
good
neighbour
.
"
   
<EOS>
Their
conversation
be
interrupt
by
the
return
of
the
apothecary
with
the
doctor
,
who
have
very
little
of
the
faculty
in
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
be
dress
remarkably
plain
;
seem
to
be
turn
of
fifty
;
have
a
careless
air
,
and
a
sarcastical
turn
in
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
before
he
enter
the
sick
man
's
chamber
,
he
ask
some
question
concern
the
disease
;
and
when
the
apothecary
,
point
to
his
own
head
,
say
,
"
It
lie
all
here
;
"
the
doctor
,
turn
to
Sir
Launcelot
,
reply
,
"
<EOS>
if
that
be
all
,
there
be
nothing
in
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
upon
a
more
particular
enquiry
about
the
symptom
,
he
be
tell
that
the
blood
be
seemingly
viscous
,
and
salt
upon
the
tongue
;
the
urine
remarkably
acrosaline
;
and
the
faece
atrabilious
and
foetid
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
doctor
say
he
would
engage
to
find
the
same
phaenomena
in
every
healthy
man
of
the
three
kingdom
;
the
apothecary
add
,
that
the
patient
be
manifestly
comatous
,
and
moreover
afflict
with
gripe
pain
and
borborygmata
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
f####t
for
your
borborygmata
,
(
cry
the
physician
.
)
<EOS>
what
have
be
do
?
"
<EOS>
to
this
question
he
reply
,
that
venaesection
have
be
three
time
perform
:
that
a
vesicatory
have
be
apply
inter
scapula
:
that
the
patient
have
take
occasionally
of
a
cathartic
apozem
,
and
,
between
while
,
alexipharmic
bolus
and
neutral
draught
.
  
<EOS>
"
neutral
,
indeed
,
(
say
the
doctor
;
)
<EOS>
so
neutral
,
that
I
will
be
crucify
if
ever
they
declare
either
for
the
patient
or
the
disease
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
brush
into
Crabshaw
's
chamber
,
follow
by
our
adventurer
,
who
be
almost
suffocate
at
his
first
entrance
.
<EOS>
the
day
be
close
,
the
window

fasten
;
a
huge
fire

where
the
wretched

the
nurse

who
have
all
the
exterior
of
a
bawd
give
to
drink
,
sit
stew
in
this
apartment

like
a
damned
soul
in
some
infernal
bagnio

but
rise
,
when
the
company
enter

make
her
curtsy
with
great
decorum

<EOS>
"
<EOS>

<EOS>
how

"
<EOS>
"
bless

<EOS>
I

and
twenty
stool
since

<EOS>
but
then

<EOS>

<EOS>
the

the
hapless

appear
very
pale
and
ghastly
;
and
have
survey
his
master
with
a
rueful
aspect

address
him
in
these
word
:
   
"
<EOS>
Sir

I
beg
a
boon

be
pleased
to

a
stone
about

neck

apothecary

in

from

mad

,
in

course

find
mean

who
appear
to
be
a
sort

cynic

tincture
with
misanthropy

at
open
war

London
road

lay
aside
his
armour
at

distance

his
interview

regale
his
imagination
with
plan

connubial
happiness

form
on

incomparable
Aurelia

determine
to
wait
with
patience

until
the
law
should
supersede
the
authority

her
guardian

I

mean
to

and
contrive
in
such
a
manner
as
to
conceal
his
whole
visage

except
the

instead
of

chapter
XVII
contain
adventure
of
chivalry
,
equally
new
and
surprising
.
 
<EOS>
the
knight
Sir
Launcelot
,
and
the
novice
Crowe
,
retreat
with
equal
order
and
expedition
to
the
distance
of
half
a
league
from
the
field
of
battle
,
where
the
former
,
halt
,
propose
to
make
a
lodgment
in
a
very
decent
house
of
entertainment
,
distinguish
by
the
sign
of
St
George
of
Cappadocia
encounter
the
dragon
,
an
atchievement
in
which
temporal
and
spiritual
chivalry
be
happily
reconcile
.
<EOS>
two
such
figure
alight
at
the
inn
-
gate
,
do
not
pass
through
the
yard
unnoticed
and
unadmired
by
the
guest
and
attendant
;
some
of
whom
fairly
take
to
their
heel
,
on
the
supposition
that
these
outlandish
creature
be
the
avant
courier
,
or
harald
of
a
french
invasion
.
   
<EOS>
the
fear
and
doubt
,
however
,
of
those
who
venture
to
stay
be
soon
dispel
,
when
our
hero
accost
them
in
the
english
tongue
,
and
with
the
most
courteous
demeanour
desire
to
be
shew
into
an
apartment
.
<EOS>
have
captain
Crowe
be
the
spokesman
,
perhaps
their
suspicion
would
not
have
so
quickly
subside
;
for
he
be
,
in
reality
,
a
very
extraordinary
novice
,
not
only
in
chivalry
,
but
also
in
his
external
appearance
,
and
particularly
in
those
dialect
of
the
english
language
which
be
use
by
the
terrestrial
animal
of
this
kingdom
.
<EOS>
He
desire
the
hostler
to
take
his
horse
in
tow
,
and
bring
him
to
his
mooring
in
a
safe
riding
.
<EOS>
He
order
the
waiter
,
who
shew
them
into
a
parlour
,
to
bear
-
a
hand
,
ship
his
oar
,
mind
his
helm
,
and
bring
along
-
side
a
short
allowance
of
brandy
or
grog
,
that
he
may
can
not
a
slug
into
his
bread
-
room
;
for
there
be
such
a
heaving
and
pitching
,
that
he
believe
he
should
shift
his
ballast
.
<EOS>
the
fellow
understand
no
part
of
this
address
but
the
word
brandy
,
at
mention
of
which
he
disappear
.
<EOS>
then
Crowe
,
throw
himself
into
an
elbow
-
chair
,
"
stop
my
hawse

hole
,
(
cry
he
)
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
what
be
the
matter
,
brother
;
but
,
agad
,
my
head
sing
and
simmer
like
a
pot
of
chowder
.
  
<EOS>
My
eye
-
sight
yaw
to
and
again
<EOS>
,
d'ye
see
:
 
<EOS>
then
there
be
such
a
walloping
and
whushe
in
my
hold
 
smite
my
 
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
.
  
<EOS>
here
you
swab
,
ne'er
mind
a
glass
 
<EOS>
hand
me
the
noggin
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
the
latter
part
of
this
address
be
direct
to
the
waiter
,
who
have
return
with
a
quartern
of
brandy
,
which
Crowe
,
snatch
eagerly
,
start
into
his
bread
-
room
at
one
can
not
.
<EOS>
indeed
there
be
no
time
to
be
lose
,
inasmuch
as
he
seem
to
be
on
the
verge
of
faint
away
when
he
swallow
this
cordial
,
by
which
he
be
instantaneously
revive
.
   
<EOS>
He
then
desire
the
servant
to
unbuckle
the
strap
of
his
helmet
;
but
this
be
a
task
which
the
drawer
could
not
perform
,
even
though
assist
with
the
good
office
of
Sir
Launcelot
:
for
the
head
and
jaw
be
so
much
swell
with
the
discipline
they
have
undergo
,
that
the
strap
and
buckle
lie
bury
,
as
it
be
,
in
pit
form
by
the
tumefaction
of
the
adjacent
part
.
<EOS>
fortunately
for
the
novice
,
a
neighbouring
surgeon
pass
by
the
door
on
horseback
;
a
circumstance
which
the
waiter
,
who
see
him
from
the
window
,
no
sooner
disclose
,
than
the
knight
have
recourse
to
his
assistance
.
<EOS>
this
practitioner
have
view
the
whole
figure
,
and
more
particularly
the
head
of
Crowe
,
in
silent
wonder
,
proceed
to
feel
his
pulse
;
and
then
declare
,
that
as
the
inflammation
be
very
great
,
and
go
on
with
violence
to
its
akme
,
it
would
be
necessary
to
begin
with
copious
phlebotomy
,
and
then
to
empty
the
intestinal
canal
.
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
begin
to
strip
the
arm
of
the
captain
,
who
perceive
his
aim
,
"
Avast
,
brother
,
(
cry
he
)
<EOS>
you
go
the
wrong
way
to
work
 
<EOS>
you
may
as
well
rummage
the
afterhold
,
when
the
damage
be
in
the
forecastle
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
right
again
,
when
my
jaw
be
unhoope
.
"
   
<EOS>
with
these
word
he
draw
a
clasp
-
knife
from
his
pocket
,
and
,
advance
to
a
glass
,
apply
it
so
vigorously
to
the
leather
strap
of
his
headpiece
,
that
the
Gordian
-
knot
be
cut
,
without
any
other
damage
to
his
face
than
a
moderate
scarification
,
which
,
add
to
the
tumefaction
of
feature
,
naturally
strong
,
and
a
whole
week
's
growth
of
a
very
bushy
beard
,
produce
,
on
the
whole
,
a
most
hideous
caricatura
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
there
be
a
necessity
for
the
administration
of
the
surgeon
,
who
find
diver
contusion
on
different
part
of
the
skull
,
which
even
the
tin
-
cap
have
not
be
able
to
protect
from
the
weapon
of
the
rustick
.
   
<EOS>
these
be
shave
,
and
dressed
secundum
artem
,
and
the
operator
dismiss
with
a
proper
acknowledgment
,
our
knight
detach
one
of
the
post

boy
to
the
field
of
action
for
intelligence
,
concern
Mr
Clarke
and
squire
Timothy
;
and
,
in
the
interim
,
desire
to
know
the
particular
of
Crowe
's
adventure
since
he
part
from
him
at
the
White
Hart
.
   
<EOS>
a
connected
relation
,
in
plain
English
,
be
what
he
have
little
reason
to
expect
from
the
novice
,
who
,
nevertheless
,
exert
his
faculty
to
the
uttermost
for
his
satisfaction
:
he
give
him
to
understand
,
that
in
steer
his
course
to
Birmingham
,
where
he
think
of
fit
himself
with
tackle
,
he
have
fall
in
,
by
accident
,
at
a
public
house
,
with
an
itinerant
tinker
,
in
the
very
act
of
mend
a
kettle
:
<EOS>
that
,
see
him
do
his
business
like
an
able
workman
,
he
have
apply
to
him
for
advice
;
and
the
tinker
,
after
have
consider
the
subject
,
have
undertake
to
make
him
such
a
suit
of
armour
as
neither
sword
nor
lance
should
penetrate
:
<EOS>
that
they
adjourn
to
the
next
town
,
where
the
leather
coat
,
the
plate
of
tinned
iron
,
the
lance
,
and
the
broad
sword
,
be
purchase
,
together
with
a
copper
sauce
pan
,
which
the
artist
be
now
at
work
upon
,
in
convert
it
to
a
shield
:
but
,
in
the
mean
time
,
the
captain
,
be
impatient
to
begin
his
career
of
chivalry
,
have
accommodate
himself
with
a
pot
-
lid
,
and
take
to
the
highway
,
notwithstanding
all
the
intreatie
,
tear
,
and
remonstrance
of
his
nephew
Tom
Clarke
,
who
could
not
however
be
prevail
upon
to
leave
him
in
the
dangerous
voyage
he
have
undertake
:
that
this
being
but
the
second
day
of
his
journal
,
he
descry
five
or
six
man
on
horseback
,
bear
up
full
in
his
tooth
;
upon
which
he
throw
his
sail
a

back
,
and
prepare
for
action
:
that
he
hail
them
at
a
considerable
distance
,
and
bad
them
bring
-
to
:
when
they
come
along

side
,
notwithstanding
his
hail
,
he
order
them
to
clew
up
their
corse
,
and
furl
their
topsail
,
otherwise
he
would
be
foul
of
their
quarter
:
<EOS>
that
,
hear
this
salute
,
they
luff
all
at
once
,
till
their
cloth
shake
in
the
wind
:
then
he
hollow
in
a
loud
voice
,
that
his
sweetheart
Besselia
Mizzen
wear
the
broad
pendant
of
beauty
,
to
which
they
must
strike
their
topsail
,
on
pain
of

to
the
bottom

that
,
after
have
eye
him
for
some
time
with
astonishment
,
they
clap
on
all
their
sail
,
some
of
them
run
under
his
stern
,
and
other
athwart
his
fore

foot
,
and
get
clear
off
:
that

not
satisfied
with
run

of
a
sudden
tack
about

and
one
of

board
him
on
the

quarter
,
give
him
such
a
drubbing
about
his
upper
work
,
that

that
he
return
the
salute
with
his
hop

pole
so
effectually
,
that
his
aggressor
broach

to
in
the
twinkling
of
an
hand

;
and
then
he
be
engage
with
all
the
rest
of
the
enemy

except
one
who
sheer
off

and
soon
return
with
a

fleet
of
small
craft

who
have
do
him
considerable
damage

and
,
in
all
probability
,
would
have
make

of
him
,
have
not
he
be
bring
off
by
the
knight

<EOS>
He
say
,
that
in
the
beginning
of
the
conflict
Tom
Clarke
ride
up
to
the
foremost
of
the
enemy
,
as
he
do
suppose
,
in
order
to
prevent
hostility
;
but
before
he
get
up
to
him
,
near
enough
to
hold
discourse
,
he
be
poope
with
a
sea
that
almost
send
him
to
the
bottom
,
and
then
tow
off
he
know
not
whither
.
   
<EOS>
Crowe
have
scarce

his
narration
,
which
consist
of
broken

,
and
unconnected
explosion
of

<EOS>
Our

They

"
Farmer
Prickle
,
I
be
both
sorry
and
ashamed
to
see
a
man
of
your
year
and
circumstance
so
little
respected
,
that
you
can
not
find
sufficient
bail
for
forty
pound
;
a
sure
testimony
that
you
have
neither
cultivate
the
friendship
,
nor
deserve
the
good
will
of
your
neighbour
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
of
your
quarrel
and
your
riot
,
your
insolence
,
and
litigious
disposition
;
and
often
wish
for
an
opportunity
of
give
you
a
proper
taste
of
the
law
's
correction
.
<EOS>
that
opportunity
now
offer
 
You
have
in
the
hearing
of
all
these
people
pour
forth
a
torrent
of
abuse
against
me
,
both
in
the
character
of
a
gentleman
and
of
a
magistrate
:
your
abuse
me
personally
,
perhaps
I
should
have
overlook
with
the
contempt
it
deserve
;
but
I
should
ill
vindicate
the
dignity
of
my
office
as
magistrate
,
by
suffer
you
to
insult
the
bench
with
impunity
.
<EOS>
I
shall
therefore
imprison
you
for
contempt
;
and
you
shall
remain
in
jail
,
until
you
can
find
bail
on
the
other
prosecution

that

twenty

of
heart
and
virtuous
inclination
,
and
conclude
with
appeal
to
the
knight
whether
she
do
not
look
very
pretty
in
her
green
Joseph
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
he
procure
a
plaister
for
his
own
head
,
and
help
to
apply
the
poultice
to
that
of
his
uncle
,
who
be
send
to
bed
betime
with
a
moderate
dose
of
sack
-
whey
,
to
promote
perspiration
.
<EOS>
the
other
three
pass
the
evening
to
their
mutual
satisfaction
;
and
the
justice
in
particular
grow
enamour
of
the
knight
's
character
,
dash
as
it
be
with
extravagance
.
   
<EOS>
let
us
now
leave
them
to
the
enjoyment
of
a
sober
and
rational
conversation
,
and
give
some
account
of
other
guest
who
arrive
late
in
the
evening
,
and
here
fix
their
night
-
quarter
  
<EOS>
but
as
we
have
already
trespass
on
the
reader
's
patience
we
shall
give
him
a
short
respite
until
the
next
chapter
make
its
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
chapter
XVIII
in
which
the
Rays
of
Chivalry
shine
with
renovated
Lustre
.
 
<EOS>
Our
hero
little
dream
that
he
have
a
formidable
rival
in
the
person
of
the
knight
who
arrive
about
eleven
at
the
sign
of
the
St
George
,
and
,
by
the
noise
he
make
,
give
intimation
of
his
importance
.
<EOS>
this
be
no
other
than
squire
Sycamore
,
who
,
have
receive
advice
that
Miss
Aurelia
Darnel
have
elope
from
the
place
of
her
retreat
,
immediately
take
the
field
,
in
quest
of
that
lovely
fugitive
;
hope
that
,
should
he
have
the
good
fortune
to
find
her
in
her
present
distress
,
his
good
office
would
not
be
reject
.
<EOS>
He
have
follow
the
chace
so
close
,
that
,
immediately
after
our
adventurer
's
departure
,
he
alight
at
the
inn
from
whence
<EOS>
Aurelia
have
be
convey
;
and
there
he
learn
the
particular
which
we
have
relate
above
.
<EOS>
Mr
Sycamore
have
a
great
deal
of
the
childish
romantic
in
his
disposition
,
and
,
in
the
course
of
his
amour
,
be
say
to
have
always
take
more
pleasure
in
the
pursuit
than
in
the
final
possession
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
hear
of
Sir
Launcelot
's
extravagance
,
by
which
he
be
in
some
measure
infect
;
and
he
drop
an
insinuation
,
that
he
could
eclipse
his
rival
even
in
his
own
lunatic
spere
.
<EOS>
this
hint
be
not
lose
upon
his
companion
,
counsellor
,
and
buffoon
,
the
facetious
Davy
Dawdle
,
who
have
some
humour
and
a
great
deal
of
mischief
in
his
composition
.
<EOS>
He
look
upon
his
patron
as
a
fool
,
and
his
patron
know
him
to
be
both
knave
and
fool
:
yet
the
two
character
suit
each
other
so
well
,
that
they
could
hardly
exist
asunder
.
<EOS>
Davy
be
an
artful
sycophant
,
but
he
do
not
flatter
in
the
usual
way
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
behave
en
cavalier
,
and
treat
Sycamore
,
on
whose
bounty
he
subsist
,
with
the
most
sarcastic
familiarity
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
season
his
freedom
with
certain
qualifying
ingredient
that
subdue
the
bitterness
of
it
,
and
be
now
become
so
necessary
to
the
squire
,
that
he
have
no
idea
of
enjoyment
with
which
Dawdle
be
not
some
how
or
other
connect
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
warm
dispute
betwixt
them
about
the
scheme
of
contest
the
prize
with
Sir
Launcelot
in
the
list
of
chivalry
.
   
<EOS>
sycamore
more
have
insinuate
,
that
if
he
have
a
mind
to
play
the
fool
,
he
could
wear
armour
,
wield
a
launce
,
and
manage
a
charger
,
as
well
as
Sir
Launcelot
Greaves
.
<EOS>
dawdle
snatch
the
hint
,
"
I
have
some
time
ago
,
(
say
he
)
contrive
a
scheme
for
you
,
which
I
be
afraid
you
have
not
address
enough
to
execute
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
no
difficult
matter
,
in
imitation
of
the
batchelor
Sampson
Carrasco
,
to
go
in
quest
of
Greaves
as
a
knight
errant
,
defy
him
as
a
rival
,
and
establish
a
compact
,
by
which
the
vanquish
should
obey
the
injunction
of
the
victor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
my
very
idea
.
"
<EOS>
cry
Sycamore
)
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
idea
,
(
reply
the
other
)
have
you
ever
an
idea
of
your
own
conception
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
thus
the
dispute
begin
,
and
be
maintain
with
great
vehemence
;
until
other
argument
fail
,
the
squire
offer
to
lay
a
wager
of
twenty
guinea
.
<EOS>
to
this
proposal
<EOS>
Dawdle
answer
by
the
interjection
Pish
!
<EOS>
which
inflame
Sycamore
to
a
repetition
of
the
defiance
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
You
be
in
the
right
(
say
Dawdle
)
to
use
such
an
argument
,
as
you
know
be
by
me
unanswerable
.
<EOS>
a
wager
of
twenty
guinea
will
at
any
time
overthrow
and
confute
all
the
logick
of
the
most
able
syllogist
,
who
have
not
get
a
shilling
in
his
pocket
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sycamore
look
very
grave
at
this
declaration
,
and
,
after
a
short
pause
,
say
,
"
I
wonder
,
Dawdle
,
what
you
do
with
all
your
money
!
"
<EOS>
"
I
be
surprised
you
should
give
yourself
that
trouble
 
<EOS>
I
never
ask
what
you
do
with
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
occasion
to
ask
:
you
know
pretty
well
how
it
go
.
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
do
you
upbraid
me
with
your
favour
?
 
<EOS>
'
tis
mighty
well
,
Sycamore
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
Dawdle
,
I
do
not
intend
to
affront
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
z####s
!
affront
!
<EOS>
what
d'ye
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
assure
you
,
Davy
,
you
do
not
know
me
,
if
you
think
I
could
be
so
ungenerous
as
to
 
<EOS>
a
 
to
 
"
"
I
always
think
,
whatever
fault
or
foible
you
may
have
,
Sycamore
,
that
you
be
not
deficient
in
generosity
,
 
tho
'
to
be
sure
it
be
often
very
absurdly
display
.
"
<EOS>
"
ay
,
that
be
one
of
my
great
foible
:
   
<EOS>
I
can
not
refuse
even
a
scoundrel
,
when
I
think
he
be
in
want
.
  
<EOS>
here
,
Dawdle
,
take
that
note
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
I
,
sir
,
 
what
d'ye
mean
?
 
<EOS>
what
right
have
I
to
your
note
.
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
but
Dawdle
,
  
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
by
no
mean
,
 
It
look
like
the
abuse
of
good
nature
,
 
all
the
world
know
you
be
good
-
natured
to
a
fault
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
come
,
dear
Davy
,
you
shall
 
<EOS>
you
must
oblige
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
thus
urge
,
Dawdle
accept
the
bank
note
with
great
reluctance
,
and
restore
the
idea
to
the
right
owner
.
   
<EOS>
a
suit
of
armour
be
bring
from
the
garret
or
armoury
of
his
ancestor
,
he
give
order
for
have
the
piece
scour
and
furbish
up
;
and
his
heart
dilate
with
joy
,
when
he
reflect
upon
the
superb
figure
he
should
make
when
case
in
complete
steel
,
and
arm
at
all
point
for
the
combat
.
   
<EOS>
when
he
be
fit
with
the
other
part
,
Dawdle
insist
on
buckle
on
his
helmet
,
which
weigh
fifteen
pound
,
and
the
head
-
piece
be
adjust
,
make
such
a
clatter
about
his
ear
with
a
cudgel
,
that
his
eye
have
almost
start
from
their
socket
.
<EOS>
His
voice
be
lose
within
the
vizor
,
and
his
friend
affect
not
to
understand
his
meaning
when
he
make
sign
with
his
gauntlet
,
and
endeavour
to
close
with
him
,
that
he
may
wrest
the
cudgel
from
his
hand
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
desist
,
say
,
"
I
will
warrant
the
helmet
sound
,
by
its
ringing
;
"
and
take
it
off
,
find
the
squire
in
a
cold
sweat
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
atchieve
his
first
exploit
on
the
spot
,
have
his
strength
permit
him
to
assault
Dawdle
;
but
,
what
with
want
of
air
,
and
the
discipline
he
have
undergo
,
he
have
well
nigh
swoon
away
;
and
before
he
retrieve
the
use
of
his
member
,
he
be
appease
by
the
apology
of
his
companion
,
who
protest
he
mean
nothing
more
than
to
try
if
the
helmet
be
free
of
crack
,
and
whether
or
not
it
would
prove
a
good
protection
for
the
head
it
cover
.
   
<EOS>
His
excuse
be
accept
:
the
armour
be
pack
up
,
and
next
morning
Mr
Sycamore
set
out
from
his
own
house
,
accompany
by
Dawdle
,
who
undertake
to
perform
the
part
of
his
squire
at
the
approach
combat
.
<EOS>
He
be
also
attend
by
a
servant
on
horseback
,
who
have
charge
of
the
armour
,
and
another
who
blow
the
trumpet
.
<EOS>
They
no
sooner
understand
that
our
hero
be
house
at
the
George
,
than
the
trumpeter
sound
a
charge
,
which
alarm
Sir
Launcelot
and
his
company
,
and
disturb
honest
captain
Crowe
in
the
middle
of
his
first
sleep
.
<EOS>
Their
next
step
be
to
pen
a
challenge
,
which
,
when
the
stranger
depart
,
be
by
the
trumpeter
deliver
with
great
ceremony
into
the
hand
of
Sir
Launcelot
,
who
read
it
in
these
word
:
"
to
the
knight
of
the
Crescent
,
greeting
.
   
<EOS>
whereas
I
be
inform
you
have
the
presumption
to
lay
claim
to
the
heart
of
the
peerless
Aurelia
Darnel
,
I
give
you
notice
that
I
can
admit
no
rivalship
in
the
affection
of
that
paragon
of
beauty
;
and
I
expect
that
you
will
either
resign
your
pretension
,
or
make
it
appear
in
single
combat
,
accord
to
the
law
of
arm
,
and
the
institution
of
chivalry
,
that
you
be
worthy
to
dispute
her
favour
with
him
of
the
Griffin
.
<EOS>
Polydore
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
be
not
a
little
surprised
at
this
address
,
which
,
however
,
he
pocket
in
silence
;
and
begin
to
reflect
,
not
without
mortification
,
that
he
be
treat
as
a
lunatic
by
some
person
who
want
to
amuse
himself
with
the
infirmity
of
his
fellow
creature
.
<EOS>
Mr
Thomas
Clarke
,
who
see
the
ceremony
with
which
the
letter
be
deliver
,
and
the
emotion
with
which
it
be
read
,
hie
him
to
the
kitchen
for
intelligence
,
and
there
learn
that
the
stranger
be
squire
Sycamore
.
<EOS>
He
forthwith
comprehend
the
nature
of
the
billet
,
and
,
in
the
apprehension
that
bloodshed
would
ensue
,
resolve
to
alarm
his
uncle
,
that
he
may
assist
in
keep
the
peace
.
   
<EOS>
He
accordingly
enter
the
apartment
of
the
captain
,
who
have
be
wake
by
the
trumpet
,
and
now
peevishly
ask
the
meaning
of
that
damn
piping
,
as
if
all
hand
be
call
upon
deck
.
<EOS>
clarke
have
impart
what
he
know
of
the
transaction
,
together
with
his
own
conjecture
,
the
captain
say
,
he
do
not
suppose
as
how
they
would
engage
by
candle
-
light
;
and
that
for
his
own
part
he
should
turn
out
in
the
larboard
watch
,
long
enough
before
any
signal
could
be
hove
out
for
form
the
line
.
<EOS>
with
this
assurance
the
lawyer
retire
to
his
nest
,
where
he
do
not
fail
to
dream
of
Mrs
Dolly
Cowslip
;
while
Sir
Launcelot
pass
the
night
awake
,
in
ruminate
on
the
strange
challenge
he
have
receive
.
<EOS>
He
have
get
notice
that
the
sender
be
Mr
Sycamore
,
and
hesitate
with
himself
whether
he
should
not
punish
him
for
his
impertinence
:
<EOS>
but
when
he
reflect
on
the
nature
of
the
dispute
,
and
the
serious
consequence
it
may
produce
,
he
resolve
to
decline
the
combat
,
as
a
trial
of
right
and
merit
,
found
upon
absurdity
.
<EOS>
even
in
his
maddest
hour
,
he
never
adopt
those
maxim
of
knight
-
errantry
which
relate
to
challenge
.
   
<EOS>
He
always
perceive
the
folly
and
wickedness
of
defy
a
man
to
mortal
fight
,
because
he
do
not
like
the
colour
of
his
beard
,
or
the
complexion
of
his
mistress
;
or
of
decide
by
homicide
,
whether
he
or
his
rival
deserve
the
preference
,
when
it
be
the
lady
's
prerogative
to
determine
which
should
be
the
happy
lover
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
opinion
that
chivalry
be
an
useful
institution
while
confine
to
its
original
purpose
of
protect
the
innocent
,
assist
the
friendless
,
and
bring
the
guilty
to
condign
punishment
:
but
he
could
not
conceive
how
these
law
should
be
answer
by
violate
every
suggestion
of
reason
,
and
every
precept
of
humanity
.
<EOS>
Captain
Crowe
do
not
examine
the
matter
so
philosophically
.
<EOS>
He
take
it
for
grant
that
in
the
morning
the
two
knights
would
come
to
action
,
and
sleep
sound
on
that
supposition
.
   
<EOS>
but
he
rise
before
it
be
day
,
<EOS>
resolve
to
be
some
how
concerned
in
the
fray
;
and
understanding
that
the
stranger
have
a
companion
,
set
him
down
immediately
for
his
own
antagonist
.
<EOS>
so
impatient
be
he
to
establish
this
secondary
contest
,
that
by
day
-
break
he
enter
the
chamber
of
Dawdle
,
to
which
he
be
direct
by
the
waiter
,
and
rouse
him
with
a
hilloah
,
that
may
have
be
hear
at
the
distance
of
half
a
league
.
<EOS>
Dawdle
,
startle
by
this
terrific
sound
,
spring
out
of
bed
,
and
stand
upright
on
the
floor
,
before
he
open
his
eye
upon
the
object
by
which
he
have
be
so
dreadfully
alarm
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
behold
the
head
of
Crowe
,
so
swell
and
swathe
,
so
livid
,
hideous
,
and
griefly
,
with
a
broad
sword
by
his
side
,
and
a
case
of
pistol
in
his
girdle
,
he
believe
it
be
the
apparition
of
some
murthere
man
;
his
hair
bristle
up
,
his
tooth
chatter
,
and
his
knee
knock
;
he
would
have
pray
,
but
his
tongue
deny
its
office
.
<EOS>
Crowe
see
his
perturbation
,
"
May
-
hap
,
friend
,
say
he
,
you
take
me
for
a
buccaneer
:
<EOS>
but
I
be
no
such
person

<EOS>
My
name
it

Crowe

<EOS>
I
come
not
for
your
silver

your
gold

but

how

solemn

if

will
always
find
me
in
a
posture

defence

should
he
persist
in
repeat
his
importunity
,
I
shall
without

chastise
the
messenger

"
<EOS>
His
decline
the
combat
be
interpret
into
fear
by
Mr
Sycamore
,
who
now
become
more
insolent
and
ferocious
,
on
the
supposition
of
our
knight
's
timidity
.
<EOS>
Sir
Launcelot
mean
while
go
to
breakfast
with
his
friend
,
and
have
put
on
his
armour
,
order
the
horse
to
be
bring
forth
.
   
<EOS>
then
he
pay
the
bill
,
and
walk
deliberately
to
the
gate
,
in
presence
of
squire
Sycamore
and
his
attendant
,
vault
at
one
spring
into
the
saddle
of
Bronzomarte
,
whose
neigh
and
curvet
proclaim
the
joy
he
feel
in
be
mount
by
his
accomplished
master
.
   
<EOS>
though
the
knight
of
the
Griffin
do
not
think
proper
to
insult
his
rival
personally
,
his
friend
Dawdle
do
not
fail
to
crack
some
joke
on
the
figure
and
horsemanship
of
Crowe
,
who
again
declare
he
should
be
glad
to
fall
in
with
him
upon
the
voyage
:
nor
do
Mr
Clarke
's
black
patch
and
rueful
countenance
pass
unnoticed
and
unridiculed
.
<EOS>
as
for
Timothy
Crabshaw
,
he
behold
his
brother
squire
with
the
contempt
of
a
veteran
:
and
Gilbert
pay
him
his
compliment
with
his
heel
at
parting
:
but
when
our
adventurer
and
his
retinue
be
clear
of
the
inn
,
Mr
Sycamore
order
his
trumpeter
to
sound
a
retreat
,
by
way
of
triumph
over
his
antagonist
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
would
have
content
himself
with
this
kind
of
victory
,
have
not
Dawdle
further
inflame
his
envy
and
ambition
,
by
launch
out
in
praise
of
Sir
Launcelot
.
<EOS>
He
observe
that
his
countenance
be
open
and
manly
;
his
joint
strong
knit
,
and
his
form
unexceptionable
;
that
he
tread
like
Hercules
,
and
vault
into
the
saddle
like
a
wing
Mercury
:
<EOS>
nay
,
he
even
hint
it
be
lucky
for
Sycamore
that
the
knight
of
the
Crescent
happen
to
be
so
pacifically
disposed
.
<EOS>
His
patron
sicken
at
these
praise
,
and
take
fire
at
the
last
observation
.
<EOS>
He
affect
to
undervalue
personal
beauty
,
though
the
opinion
of
the
world
have
be
favourable
to
himself
in
that
particular
:
he
say
he
be
at
least
two
inch
tall
than
greave
;
and
as
to
shape
and
air
,
he
would
make
no
comparison
;
but
with
respect
to
ride
,
he
be
sure
he
have
a
well
seat
than
Sir
Launcelot
,
and
would
wager
five
hundred
to
fifty
guinea
,
that
he
would
unhorse
him
at
the
first
encounter
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
occasion
for
lay
wager
,
reply
Mr
Dawdle
,
the
doubt
may
be
determine
in
half
an
hour
 
<EOS>
Sir
Launcelot
be
not
a
man
to
avoid
you
at
full
gallop
.
<EOS>
"
Sycamore
,
after
some
hesitation
,
declare
he
would
follow
and
provoke
him
to
battle
,
on
condition
that
Dawdle
would
engage
Crowe
;
and
this
condition
be
accept
:
for
,
though
Davy
have
no
stomach
to
the
tryal
,
he
could
not
readily
find
an
excuse
for
decline
it
:
besides
,
he
have
discover
the
captain
to
be
a
very
bad
horseman
,
and
resolve
to
eke
out
his
own
scanty
valour
with
a
border
of
ingenuity
.
<EOS>
the
servant
be
immediately
order
to
unpack
the
armour
,
and
,
in
a
little
time
,
Mr
Sycamore
make
a
very
formidable
appearance
.
<EOS>
but
the
scene
that
follow
be
too
important
to
be
huddle
in
at
the
end
of
a
chapter
;
and
therefore
we
shall
reserve
it
for
a
more
conspicuous
place
in
these
memoir

<EOS>
chapter
XIX
contain
the
atchievement
of
the
knight
of
the
Griffin
and
Crescent
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sycamore
,
alias
the
knight
of
the
Griffin
,
so
denominate
from
a
griffin
paint
on
his
shield
,
be
arm
at
all
point
,
and
his
friend
Dawdle
provide
with
a
certain
implement
,
which
he
flatter
himself
would
ensure
a
victory
over
the
novice
Crowe
;
they
set
out
from
the
George
,
with
their
attendant
,
in
all
the
elevation
of
hope
,
and
prance
along
the
highway
that
lead
towards
London
,
that
be
the
road
which
our
adventurer
pursue
.
<EOS>
as
they
be
extremely
well
mount
,
and
proceed
at
a
round
pace
,
they
,
in
less
than
two
hour
,
come
up
with
Sir
Launcelot
and
his
company
;
and
Sycamore
send
another
formal
defiance
to
the
knight
,
by
his
trumpeter
,
Dawdle
have
for
good
reason
,
decline
that
office
.
   
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
hear
himself
thus
address
,
and
see
his
rival
,
who
have
pass
him
,
post
to
obstruct
his
progress
,
armed
capapie
,
with
his
lance
in
the
rest
;
determine
to
give
the
satisfaction
that
be
require
,
and
desire
that
the
regulation
of
the
combat
may
be
establish
.
<EOS>
the
knight
of
the
Griffin
propose
,
that
the
vanquished
party
should
resign
all
pretension
to
Miss
Aurelia
Darnel
,
in
favour
of
the
victor
;
that
while
the
principal
be
engage
,
his
friend
Dawdle
should
run
a
tilt
with
captain
Crowe
;
that
squire
Crabshaw
,
and
Mr
Sycamore
's
servant
,
should
keep
themselves
in
readiness
to
assist
their
respective
master
occasionally
,
accord
to
the
law
of
arm
;
and
that
Mr
Clarke
should
observe
the
motion
of
the
trumpeter
,
whose
province
be
to
sound
the
charge
to
battle
.
   
<EOS>
Our
knight
agree
to
these
regulation
,
notwithstanding
the
earnest
and
pathetic
remonstrance
of
the
young
lawyer
,
who
,
with
tear
in
his
eye
,
conjure
all
the
combatant
,
in
their
turn
,
to
refrain
from
an
action
that
may
be
attend
with
bloodshed
and
murder
;
and
be
contrary
to
the
law
both
of
God
and
man
.
<EOS>
in
vain
he
endeavour
to
move
them
by
tear
and
entreaty
,
by
threatne
them
with
prosecution
in
this
world
,
and
pain
and
penalty
in
the
next
:
they
persist
in
their
resolution
,
and
his
uncle
would
have
begin
hostility
on
his
carcase
,
have
not
he
be
prevent
by
Sir
Launcelot
,
who
exhort
Clarke
to
retire
from
the
field
,
that
he
may
not
be
involve
in
the
consequence
of
the
combat
.
<EOS>
He
relish
this
advice
so
well
,
that
he
have
actually
move
off
to
some
distance
;
but
his
apprehension
and
concern
for
his
friend
co
-
operating
with
an
insatiable
curiosity
,
detain
him
in
fight
of
the
engagement
.
   
<EOS>
the
two
knight
have
fairly
divide
the
ground
,
and
the
same
precaution
be
take
by
the
second
,
on
another
part
of
the
field
,
Sycamore
begin
to
be
invade
with
some
scruple
,
which
be
probably
engender
by
the
martial
appearance
,
and
well
know
character
of
his
antagonist
.
<EOS>
the
confidence
which
he
have
derive
from
the
reluctance
of
Sir
Launcelot
now
vanish
,
because
it
plainly
appear
,
that
the
knight
's
backwardness
be
not
owe
to
personal
timidity
;
and
he
foresee
that
the
prosecution
of
this
joke
may
be
attend
with
very
serious
consequence
to
his
own
life
and
reputation
.
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
desire
a
parley
,
in
which
he
observe
his
affection
for
Miss
Darnel
be
of
such
a
delicate
nature
,
that
should
the
discomfiture
of
his
rival
contribute
to
make
her
unhappy
,
his
victory
must
render
him
the
most
miserable
wretch
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
He
propose
,
therefore
,
that
her
sentiment
and
choice
should
be
ascertain
before
they
proceed
to
extremity
.
   
<EOS>
Sir
Launcelot
declare
that
he
be
much
more
afraid
of
combat
Aurelia
's
inclination
,
than
of
oppose
the
knight
of
the
Griffin
in
arm
;
and
that
if
he
have
the
least
reason
to
think
Mr
Sycamore
,
or
any
other
person
,
be
distinguish
by
her
preference
,
he
would
instantly
give
up
his
suit
as
desperate
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
he
observe
that
Sycamore
have
proceed
too
far
to
retract
;
that
he
have
insult
a
gentleman
,
and
not
only
challenge
,
but
even
pursue
him
,
and
block
up
his
passage
in
the
public
highway
;
outrage
which
he
(
Sir
Launcelot
)
would
not
suffer
to
pass
unpunished
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
he
insist
on
the
combat
,
on
pain
of
treat
Mr
Sycamore
as
a
craven
,
and
a
recreant
.
<EOS>
this
declaration
be
reinforce
by
Dawdle
,
who
tell
him
that
should
he
now
decline
the
engagement
,
all
the
world
would
look
upon
him
as
an
infamous
poltroon
.
   
<EOS>
these
two
observation
give
a
necessary
fillip
to
the
courage
of
the
challenger
.
<EOS>
the
party
take
their
station
:
the
trumpet
sound
to
charge
,
and
the
combatant
begin
their
career
with
great
impetuosity
.
   
<EOS>
whether
the
gleam
of
Sir
Launcelot
's
arm
affright
Mr
Sycamore
's
steed
,
or
some
other
object
have
an
unlucky
effect
on
his
eye
-
sight
;
certain
it
be
he
start
at
about
midway
,
and
give
his
rider
such
a
violent
shake
as
discompose
his
attitude
,
and
disable
him
from
use
his
lance
to
the
good
advantage
.
<EOS>
have
our
hero
continue
his
career
,
with
his
launce
couch
,
in
all
probability
<EOS>
Sycamore
's
armour
would
have
prove
but
a
bad
defence
to
his
carcase
:
but
Sir
Launcelot
perceive
his
rival
's
spear
unrested
,
have
just
time
to
throw
up
the
point
of
his
own
,
when
the
two
horse
close
with
such
a
shock
,
that
Sycamore
,
already
wavering
in
the
saddle
,
be
overthrow
,
and
his
armour
crash
around
him
as
he
fall
.
   
<EOS>
the
victor
,
see
him
lie
without
motion
,
alight
immediately
and
begin
to
unbuckle
his
helmet
,
in
which
office
he
be
assist
by
the
trumpeter
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
head

piece
be
remove
,
the
hapless
knight
of
the
Griffin
appear
in
the
pale
livery
of
death
,
tho

<EOS>
he
be
only
in
a
swoon
,
from
which
he
soon
recover
by
the
effect
of
the
fresh
air
,
and
the
aspersion
of
cold
water
,
bring
from
a
small
pool
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
when
he
recognize
his
conqueror
do
the
office
of
humanity
about
his
person
,
he
close
his
eye
from
vexation
,

he
himself
owe
his
mischance
to
the
fault
of
his
own
horse
;
and
observe
that
this
ridiculous
affair
would
not
have
happen
,
but
for
the
mischievous
instigation
of
that
scoundrel
Dawdle
,
on
whose
rib
he
threaten
to
revenge
his
mishap
.
   
<EOS>
perhaps
captain
Crowe
may
have
save
him
this
trouble
,
have
that
wag
honourably
adhere
to
the
institution
of
chivalry
,
in
his
conflict
with
our
novice
:
but
on
this
occasion
,
his
ingenuity
be
more
commendable
than
his
courage
.
<EOS>
He
have
provide
at
the
inn
a
blow
bladder
,
in
which
several
smooth
pebble
be
inclose
;
and
this
he
slily
fix
on
the
head
of
his
pole
,
when
the
captain
obey
the
signal
of
battle
.
   
<EOS>
instead
of
bear
the
brunt
of
the
encounter
,
he
turn
out
of
the
straight
line
,
so
as
to
avoid
the
launce
of
his
antagonist
,
and
rattle
his
bladder
with
such
effect
,
that
Crowe
's
horse
prick
up
his
ear
,
take
to
his
heel
,
and
flee
across
some
ploughed
land
with
such
precipitation
,
that
the
rider
be
oblige

quit
his
spear
,
and
lie
fast
hold
on
the
mane

that
he
may
not
be

<EOS>
Dawdle
,
who
be
much
better
mount
,
see
his
condition
,
ride
up
to
the
unfortunate
novice
,
and
belabour
his
shoulder
without
fear
of
retaliation
.
<EOS>
Mr
Clarke
,
see
his
kinsman
so
roughly
handle
,
forget
his
fear
,
and
fly
to
his
assistance
;
but
,
before
he
come
up
,
the
aggressor
have
retire
,
and
now
perceive
that
fortune
have
declare
against
his
friend
and
patron
,
very
honourably
abandon
him
in
his
distress
,
and
go
off
at
full
speed
for
London
.
   
<EOS>
nor
be
Timothy
Crabshaw
without
his
share
in
the
noble
atchievement
of
this
propitious
day
.
   
<EOS>
He
have
by
this
time
imbibe
such
a
tincture
of
errantry
,
that
he
firmly
believe
himself
and
his
master
equally
invincible
;
and
this
belief
operate
upon
a
perverse
disposition
,
render
him
as
quarrelsome
in
his
sphere
,
as
his
master
be
mild
and
forbearing
.
<EOS>
as
he
sit
on
horseback
,
in
the
place
assign
to
him
and
Sycamore
's
lacquey
,
he
manage
Gilbert
in
such
a
manner
,
as
to
invade
with
his
heel
,
the
posterior
of
the
other

horse
;
and
this
insult
produce
some
altercation
,
which
end
in
mutual
assault

<EOS>
the
footman
handle
the
butt
-
end
of
his
horse
-
whip
with
great
dexterity
about
the
head
of
Crabshaw
,
who
declare
afterwards
,
that
it
sing
and
simmer
like
a
kettle
of
cod
-
fish
:
but
the
squire
who
understand
the
nature
of
long
lash
,
as
have
be
a
carter
from
his
infancy
,
find
mean
to
twine
his
thong
about
the
neck
of
his
antagonist
,
and
pull
him
off
his
horse
half
strangle
,
at
the
very
instant
his
master
be
throw
by
Sir
Launcelot
Greaves
.
   
<EOS>
have
thus
obtain
the
victory
,
he
do
not
much
regard
the
punctilio
of
chivalry
;
but
take
it
for
grant
<EOS>
he
have
a
right
to
make
the
most
of
his
advantage
,
resolve
to
carry
off
the
spolia

<EOS>
alight
with
great
agility

rifle

strip
him
of

hat

take
possession
of
his
master
's
portmanteau

he
do
not

enjoy
his
plunder
:
for
the
lacquey
complain
to
Sir
Launcelot

of
his

be
despoil
,
the
knight
command
his
squire
to
refund
,
not
without
menace
of
subject
him
to
the
severe
chastisement
,
for
his
injustice
and
rapacity
.
   
<EOS>
Timothy
represent
,
with
great
vehemence
,
that
he
have
win
the
spoil
in
fair
battle
,
at
the
expence
of
his
head
and
shoulder
,
which
he
immediately
uncover
,
to
prove
his
allegation
:
but
<EOS>
his
remonstrance
have
no
effect
upon
his
master
,
"

<EOS>
with
these
word
,
he
make
a
most
furious
attack
upon
the
plaintiff
,
with
his
horse
-
whip
,
and
before
the
knight
could
interpose
,
repayed
the
lacquey
with
interest
.
<EOS>
as
an
appurtenance
to
Sycamore
and
Dawdle
,
he
run
the
risque
of
another
assault
from
the
novice
Crowe
,
who
be
so
transport
with
rage

at
the
disagreeable
trick
which
have
be
play
upon
him
,
by
his
fugitive
antagonist
,
that
he
could
not
for
some
time
pronounce
an
articulate
sound
,
but
a
few
broken
interjection
,
the
meaning
of
which
could
not
be
ascertain
.
   
<EOS>
snatch
up
his
pole
,
he
run
towards
the
place
where
Mr
Sycamore
sit
on
the
grass
,
support
by
the
trumpeter
,
and
would
have
finish
what
our
adventurer
have
leave
undo
,
if
the
knight
of
the
Crescent
,
with
admirable
dexterity
,
have
not
ward
off
the
blow
which
he
aim
at
the
knight
of
the
Griffin
,
and
signify
his
displeasure
in
a
resolute
tone
:
then
he
collar
the
lacquey
,
who
be
just
disengage
from
the
chastise
hand
of
Crabshaw
,
and
swinge
his
launce
with
his
other
hand
,
encounter
the
squire

rib
by
accident

<EOS>
Timothy
be
not
slow
in

the
salutation

<EOS>
His
next
step
be
to
procure
a
saddle

horse
for
Dolly

who
prefer
this

<EOS>
as
for

suffusion
;
his

appear
so
flat

so
tumified

<EOS>
the
first
step
which
Sir
Launcelot
take
in
the
morning
that
succeed
his
arrival
in
London
,
be
to
settle
Mrs
Dolly
Cowslip
in
lodging
at
the
house
where
John
Clump
have
promise
to
visit
her
;
as
he
do
not
doubt
,
that
tho
'
the
visit
be
delay
,
it
would
some
time
or
other
be
perform
;
and
in
that
case
,
he
may
obtain

earnestly
desire
he
may
be
intrust
with
the
office
of
convey
information
and
instruction
between
Dolly
and
our
adventurer
.
   
<EOS>
the
knight
himself
resolve
to
live
retired
until
he
should
receive
some
tiding
relate
to
Miss
Darnel
,
that
would
influence
his
conduct
;
but
he
propose
to
frequent
place
of
public
resort
incognito
,
that
he
may
have
some
chance
of
meeting
by
accident
with
the
mistress
of
his
heart
.
<EOS>
take
it
for
grant
that
the
oddity
of
Crowe
would
help
to
amuse
him
in
his
hour
of
solitude
and
disappointment
,
he
invite
that
original

be
his
guest
at
a
small
house
which
he
determine
to
hire
ready
furnish
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Golden

<EOS>
the
captain
thank
him
for
his
courtesy
,
and
frankly
embrace
his
offer
;
tho
'
he
do
not
much
approve
of
the
knight
's
choice
,
in
point
of
situation
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
would
recommend
him
to
a
special
good
upper
deck
hard
by
St
Catherine
's
in
Wapping
,
where
he
would
be
delight
with

<EOS>
as
a
further
inducement
,
he
mention
the
vicinity
of
the
Tower
gun
,
which
would
regale
his
hearing
on
day
of
salutation
;
nor
do
he
forget
get
the
sweet
sound
of
mooring
and
unmooring
ship
in
the

,
and
the
pleasing
object
on

<EOS>
Sir
Launcelot
be
not
insensible
to
the
beauty
of
this
landscape
;
but
,
his
pursuit
lie
another
way
,
he
content
himself
with
a
less
enchanting
situation
,
and
Crowe
accompany
him
out
of
pure
friendship
.
<EOS>
at
night
Mr
Clarke
arrive
at
our
hero
's
house
with
tiding
that
be
by
no
mean
agreeable
.
<EOS>
He
tell
him
that
Clump
have
leave
a
letter
for
Dolly
,
inform
her
that
his
master
"
squire
Darnel
be
to
set
out
early
in
the
morning
for
Yorkshire
;
but
he
could
give
no
account
of
her
lady
,
who
have
<EOS>
,
the
day
before
,
be
convey
,
he
know
not
whither
,
in
a
hackney
-
coach
,
attend
by
his
uncle
and
an
ill
-
look
fellow
,
who
have
much
the
appearance
of
a
bailiff
or
turnkey
;
so
that
he
fear
she
be
in
trouble
.
   
<EOS>
Sir
Launcelot
be
deeply
affect
by
this
intimation
.
<EOS>
His
apprehension
be
even
rouse
by
a
suspicion
that
a
man
of
Darnel
's
violent
temper
,
and
unprincipled
heart
,
may
have
practise
upon
the
life
of
his
lovely
niece
:
but
,
upon
recollection
,
he
could
not
suppose
that
he
have
recourse
to
such
infamous
expedient
,
know
,
as
he
do
,
that
an
account
of
her
would
be
demand
at
his
hand
,
and
that
it
would
be
easily
prove
he
have
convey
her
from
the
lodging
in
which
she
reside
.
<EOS>
His
first
fear
now
give
way
to
another
suggestion
,
that
Anthony
,
in
order
to
intimidate
her
into
a
compliance
with
his
proposal
,
have
trump
up
a
spurious
claim
against
her
,
and
by
virtue
of
a
writ
confine
her
in
some
prison
or
spunging
-
house
.
   
<EOS>
possess
with
this
idea
,
he
desire
Mr
Clarke
to
search
the
sheriff
's
office
in
the
morning
,
that
he
may
know
whether
any
such
writ
have
be
grant
;
and
he
himself
resolve
to
make
a
tour
of
the
great
prison
belong
to
the
metropolis
,
to
enquire
if
perchance
she
may
not
be
confine
under
a
borrow
name
.
<EOS>
finally
,
he
determine
,
if
possible
,
to
apprise
her
of
his
place
of
abode
by
a
paragraph
in
all
the
daily
paper
,
signify
that
Sir
Launcelot
Greaves

<EOS>
all

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
there
they

<EOS>
His
ejaculation
be
interrupt
by
a
tumultuous
noise
in
the
street

and
Mr
Norton
declare
he
be
send
for
to
the
lodge
,
consign
our
hero
to
the
care
of
one
Mr
Felton

a
prisoner

decent

and
invite
the
company
to

which

commodious

<EOS>
when
Sir
Launcelot
ask
the
cause
of
that
uproar

he
tell
him
that
it
be
the
prelude
to
a
boxing

match
between
two
of

to

decide
in

<EOS>
Capt
Crowe
express
an
eager
curiosity
to
see
the
battle
<EOS>
,
Mr
Felton
assure
him
there
would
be
no
sport
,
as
the
combatant
be
both
reckon
dunghill
:
"
but
,
in
half
an
hour
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
there
will
be
a
battle
of
some
consequence
between
two
of
the
demagogue
of
the
place
,
Dr
Crabclaw
and
Mr
Tapley
,
the
first
a
physician
,
and
the
other
a
brewer
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
Gentlemen
,
that
this
microcosm
or
republic
in
miniature
,
be
like
the
great
world
,
split
into
saction
.
   
<EOS>
Crabclaw
be
the
leader
of
one
party
;
and
the
other
be
head
by
Tapley
:
both
be
man
of
warm
and
impetuous
temper
;
and
their
intrigue
have
embroil
the
whole
place
,
<EOS>
insomuch
that
it
be
dangerous
to
walk
the
street
,
on
account
of
the
continual
skirmish
of
their
partizan
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
some
of
the
more
sedate
inhabitant
have
meet
and
deliberate
upon
some
remedy
for
these
grow
disorder
,
propose
that
the
dispute
should
be
at
once
decide
by
single
combat
between
the
two
chiefs
,
who
readily
agree
to
the
proposal
.
<EOS>
the
match
be
accordingly
make
for
five
guinea
,
and
this
very
day
and
hour
appoint
for
the
trial
,
on
which
considerable
sum
of
money
be
depend
.
<EOS>
as
for
Mr
Norton
,
it
be
not
proper
that
he
should
be
present
,
or
seem
to
countenance
such
violent
proceeding
,
which
,
however
,
it
be
necessary
to
connive
at
,
as
convenient
vent
for
the
evaporation
of
those
humour
,
which
be
confine
,
may
accumulate
and
break
out
with
great
fury
,
in
conspiracy
and
rebellion
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
knight
own
he
could
not
conceive
by
what
mean
such
a
number
of
licentious
people
,
amount
,
with
their
dependant
,
to
above
five
hundred
,
be
restrain
within
the
bound
of
any
tolerable
discipline
,
or
prevent
from
make
their
escape
;
which
they
may
at
any
time
accomplish
,
either
by
stealth
or
open
violence
,
as
it
could
not
be
suppose
that
one
or
two
turnkey
,
continually
employ
in
opening
and
shut
the
door
,
could
resist
the
effort
of
a
whole
multitude
.
"
<EOS>
Your
wonder
,
good
Sir
,
(
say
Mr
Felton
)
will
vanish
,
when
you
consider
it
be
hardly
possible
that
the
multitude
should
cooperate
in
the
execution
of
such
a
scheme
;
and
that
the
keeper
perfectly
well
understand
the
maxim
divide
et
impera
.
<EOS>
many
prisoner
be
restrain
by
the
dictate
of
gratitude
towards
the
deputy
-
marshal
,
whose
friendship
and
good
office
they
have
experience
:
some
,
no
doubt
,
be
actuate
by
motive
of
discretion
.
   
<EOS>
one
party
be
an
effectual
check
upon
the
other
;
and
I
be
firmly
persuade
that
there
be
not
ten
prisoner
within
the
place
that
would
make
their
escape
,
if
the
door
be
lay
open
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
step
which
no
man
would
take
,
unless
his
fortune
be
altogether
desperate
;
because
it
would
oblige
him
to
leave
his
country
for
life
,
and
expose
him
to
the
most
imminent
risque
of
be
retake
and
treat
with
the
utmost
severity
.
<EOS>
the
majority
of
the
prisoner
live
in
the
most
lively
hope
of
be
release
by
the
assistance
of
their
friend
,
the
compassion
of
their
creditor
,
or
the
favour
of
the
legislature
.
<EOS>
some
who
be
cut
off
from
all
these
proposal
,
be
become
naturalized
to
the
place
,
know
they
can
not
subsist
in
any
other
situation
.
<EOS>
I
,
myself
,
be
one
of
these
.
<EOS>
after
have
resign
all
my
effect
for
the
benefit
of
my
creditor
,
I
have
be
detain
these
nine
year
in
prison
,
because
one
person
refuse
to
sign
my
certificate
.
<EOS>
I
have
long
outlive
all
my
friend
from
whom
I
could
expect
the
least
countenance
or
favour
:
   
<EOS>
I
be
grow
old
in
confinement
;
and

by
dint
of
industry

and
the
most
rigid
oeconomy

I
make
shift
to
live
independant
in
this
retreat

all
my

of
fortune
have
be
long
blast

<EOS>
I
have
no

<EOS>
I
must
,
therefore
,
starve
in
some
sequestered
corner
,
or
be
recaptivate
and
confine
for
ever
to
close
prison
,
deprive
of
the
indulgence
which
I
now
enjoy

"
   
<EOS>
here
the
conversation
be
break
off
by
another
uproar
,
which
be
the
signal
to
battle
between
the
doctor
and
his
antagonist
.
<EOS>
the
company
immediately
adjourn
to
the
field
,
where
the
combatant
be
already
undress
and
the
stake
deposit
.
   
<EOS>
the
doctor
seem
of
the
middle
age
and
middle
stature
,
active
and
alert
,
with
an
atrabilarious
aspect
,
and
a
mixture
of
rage
and
disdain
express
in
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
the
brewer
be
large
,
raw
-
boned
,
and
round
as
a
but
of
beer
,
but
very
fat
,
unwieldy
,
short
-
winded
and
phlegmatic
.
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
be
not
a
little
surprised
when
he
behold
in
the
character
of
second
,
a
male
and
a
female
strip
naked
from
the
waist
upwards
,
the
latter
range
on
the
side
of
the
physician
:
but
the
commencement
of
the
battle
prevent
his
demanding
of
his
guide
an
explanation
of
this
phoenomenon
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
retire
some
pace
backwards
,
throw
himself
into
the
attitude
of
a
battering
ram
,
and
rush
upon
his
antagonist
with
great
impetuosity
,
foreseeing
that
should
he
have
the
good
fortune
to
over
-
turn
him
in
the
first
assault
<EOS>
,
it
would
not
be
an
easy
task
to
raise
him
up
again
and
put
him
in
a
capacity
of
offence
.
   
<EOS>
but
the
momentum
of
Crabclaw
's
head
,
and
the
concomitant
effort
of
his
knuckle
,
have
no
effect
upon
the
rib
of
Tapley
,
who
stand
firm
as
the
acroceraunian
promontory
:
and
step
forward
with
his
project
fist
,
something
small
and
soft
than
a
sledge
-
hammer
,
strike
the
physician
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
in
a
trice
,
however
,
by
the
assistance
of
his
female
second
,
he
be
on
his
leg
again
,
and
grapple
with
his
antagonist
,
endeavour
to
tip
him
a
fall
;
but
,
instead
of
accomplish
his
purpose
,
he
receive
a
cross
-
buttock
,
and
the
brewer
throw
himself
upon
him
as
he
fall
,
have
well
-
nigh
smother
him
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
the
amazon
fly
to
his
assistance
,
and
Tapley
shew
no
inclination
to
get
up
,
she
smite
him
on
the
temple
 
'
till
he
roar
.
   
<EOS>
the
male
second
hastening
to
the
relief
of
his
principal
,
make
application
to
the
eye
of
the
female
,
which
be
immediately
surround
with
black
circle
;
and
she
return
the
salute
with
a
blow
which
bring
a
double
stream
of
blood
from
his
nostril
,
greet
him
at
the
same
time
with
the
opprobrious
appellation
of
a
lousy
son
of
a
b####h
.
<EOS>
a
combat
more
furious
than
the
first
would
now
have
ensue
,
have
not
Felton
interpose
with
an
air
of
authority
,
and
insist
on
the
man
's
leave
the
field
;
an
injunction
which
he
forthwith
obey
,
say
,
"
well
,
damme
,
Felton
,
you
be
my
friend
and
commander
:
I
will
obey
your
order
 
but
the
b####h
will
be
foul
of
me
before

"
<EOS>
then
Felton
,
advance
to
his
opponent
,
"
Madam

(
say
he
)

I
be
very
sorry
to
see
a
lady
of
your
rank

qualification
expose
yourself
in
this
manner

<EOS>
for
God
's
sake
,
behave
with
a
little
more
decorum
;
if
not
for
the
sake
of
your
own
family

at
least
for
the
credit
of
your
sex
in
general

<EOS>
"
Hark
ye
,
Felton
,
(
say
she
)
decorum
be
found
upon
a
delicacy
of
sentiment
and
deportment
,
which
can
not
consist
with
the
disgrace
of
a
jail
,
and
the
misery
of
indigence
.
     
<EOS>
but
I
see
the
dispute
be
now
terminate
,
and
the
money
be
to
be
drink
:
if
you
will
dine
with
us
you
shall
be
welcome

if
not

you
may
die
in
your
sobriety

<EOS>
by
this
time
the
doctor
have
give
out
,
and
allow
the
brewer
to
be
the
well
man
;
yet
he
would
not
honour
the
festival
with
his
presence
,
but
retire
to
his
chamber
,
exceedingly
mortify
at
his
defeat
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
be
reconducte
to
Mr
Felton
's
apartment
,
where
he
sit
some
time
without
open
his
mouth
,
<EOS>
so
astonish
he
be
at
what
he
have
see
and
hear

<EOS>
"
I
perceive
,
Sir

(
say
the
prisoner
)
<EOS>
you
be
surprised
at
the
manner
in
which
I
accost
that
unhappy
woman
;

perhaps
you
will
be
more
surprised
when
you
hear

that
within
these
eighteen
month

she
be
actually
a
person
of
fashion

her
opponent

overwhelm

amazement

an
eager
curiosity

the
fatal

I
will
rein
my

if
you
will
favour
me
with
your
company
at
a
tavern
in
the

I

a
favour

I

Mr

his

this
effect
:
   
"
<EOS>
all
that
I
know
of
Captain
Clewlin
,
previous
to
his
commitment
,
be
,
that
he
be
commander
of
a
sloop
of
war
,
and
bore
the
reputation
of
a
gallant
officer
;
that
he
marry
the
daughter
of
a
rich
merchant
in
the
city
of
London
against
the
inclination
,
and
without
the
knowledge
of
her
father
,
who
renounce
her
for
this
act
of
disobedience
:
that
the
captain
console
himself
for
the
rigour
of
the
parent
with
the
possession
of
the
lady
,
who
be
not
only
remarkably
beautiful
in
person
,
but
highly
accomplished
in
her
mind
,
and
amiable
in
her
disposition

<EOS>
such
,
a
few
month
ago
,
be
those
two
person
whom
you
see
act
in
such
a
vulgar
capacity
.
<EOS>
when
they
first
enter
the
prison
they
be
undoubtedly
the
handsome
couple
mine
eye
ever
behold
,
and
their
appearance
win
universal
respect
even
from
the
most
brutal
inhabitant
of
the
jail
.
   
<EOS>
the
captain
have
unwarily
involve
himself
as
security
for
a
man
to
whom
he
have
lain
under
obligation
,
become
liable
for
a
considerable
sum
;
and
his
own
father

of
the

this
opportunity
of
wreak
vengeance
upon
him
for
have
espouse
his

He
watch
an
opportunity
until
the

have
actually
stept
into

chaise
with
his

for
Portsmouth
,
where
his

lie

cause
him
to

most
public

shameful
manner

Mrs
Clewlin
have
like
to
have
sink
under
the
first
transport
of
her
grief
and
mortification
;
but
these
subside
<EOS>
,
she
have
recourse
to
personal
sollicitation

<EOS>
She
go
with
her
only
child
in
her
arm
(
a
lovely
boy

to
her
father
's
door
,
and
be
deny
admittance
,
kneel
down
in
the
street
,
implore
his
compassion
in
the
most
pathetic
strain
;
but
this
hard
-
hearted
citizen
,
instead
of
recognize
his
child
,
and
take
the
poor
mourner
to
his
bosom
,
insult
her
from
the
window
with
the
most
bitter
reproach

shocking

"
Strumpet

<EOS>
the
unfortunate
lady
be
cut
to
the
heart
by
this
usage
,
and
faint
in
the
street
;
from
whence
she
be
convey
to
a
public
house
by
the
charity
of
some
passenger
.
<EOS>
She
afterwards
attempt
to
soften
the
barbarity
of
her
father
,
by
repeat
letter
,
and
by
interest
some
of
his
friend
to
intercede
with
him
in
her
behalf
;
but
all
her
endeavour
prove
ineffectual
,
she
accompany
her
husband
to
the
prison
of
the
King's

bench
,
where
she
must
have
feel
,
in
the
severest
manner
,
the
fatal
reverse
of
circumstance
to
which
she
be
expose
.
<EOS>
the
captain
be
disable
from
go
to
sea
,
be
superseded
,
and
he
see
all
his
hope
blast
in
the
midst
of
an
active
war
,
at
a
time
when
he
have
the
fair
prospect
of
fame
and
fortune
.
   
<EOS>
He
see
himself
reduce
to
extreme
poverty
,
coope
up
with
the
tender
partner
of
his
heart
in
a
wretched
hovel
,
amidst
the
refuse
of
mankind
,
and
on
the
brink
of
want
the
common
necessary
of
life

<EOS>
the
mind
of
man
be
ever
ingenious

find
resource

<EOS>
He
comfort
his
lady
with
vain
hope
of
have
friend
who
would
effect
his
deliverance
,
and
repeat
assurance
of
this
kind
so
long
,
that
he
at
length
begin
to
think
they
be
not
altogether
void
of
foundation
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Clewlin
,
from
a
principle
of
duty
,
recollect
all
her
fortitude
,
that
she
may
not
only
bear
her
fate
with
patience
,
but
even
contribute
to
alleviate
the
woe
of
her
husband
,
whom
her
affection
have
ruin
.
<EOS>
She
affect
to
believe
the
suggestion
of
his
pretended
hope
;
she
interchange
with
him
assurance
of
well
fortune
;
her
appearance
exhibit
a
calm
,
while
her
heart
be
tear
with
anguish
.
   
<EOS>
She
assist
him
in
write
letter
to
former
friend
,
the
last
consolation
of
the
wretched
prisoner
;
she
deliver
these
letter
with
her
own
hand
,
and
undergo
a
thousand
mortifying
repulse
,
the
most
shocking
circumstance
of
which
she
conceal
from
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
perform
all
the
menial
office
in
her
own
little
family
,
which
be
maintain
by
pawn
her
apparel
;
and
both
the
husband
and
wife
,
in
some
measure
,
sweeten
their
care
,
by
prattle
and
toy
with
their
charming
little
boy
,
on
whom
they
doate
with
an
enthusiasm
of
fondness
.
  
<EOS>
yet
even
this
pleasure
be
mingle
with
the
most
tender
and
melancholy
regret
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
the
mother
hang
over
him
,
with
the
most
affecting
expression
of
this
kind
in
her
aspect
,
the
tear
contend
with
the
smile
upon
her
countenance
,
while
she
exclaim
:
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
my
poor
prisoner
,
little
do
your
mother
once
think
she
should
be
oblige
to
nurse
you
in
a
jail
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
captain
's
paternal
love
be
dash
with
impatience
  
<EOS>
He
would
snatch
up
the
boy
in
a
transport
of
grief
,
press
him
to
his
breast
,
devour
him
as
it
be
with
kiss
,
throw
up
his
eye
to
heaven
in
the
most
emphatic
silence
;
then
convey
the
child
hastily
to
his
mother
's
arm
,
pull
his
hat
over
his
eye
,
stalk
out
into
the
common
walk
,
and
find
himself
alone
,
break
out
into
tear
and
lamentation
.
   
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
little
<EOS>
do
this
unhappy
couple
know
what
further
griefs
await
them
!
<EOS>
the
small
-
pox
break
out
in
the
prison
,
and
poor
Tommy
Clewlin
be
infect
.
<EOS>
as
the
eruption
appear
unfavourable
,
you
may
conceive
the
consternation
with
which
they
be
overwhelmed
.
<EOS>
Their
distress
be
render
inconceiveable
by
indigence
;
for
,
by
this
time
,
they
be
so
destitute
that
they
could
neither
pay
for
common
attendance
,
nor
procure
proper
advice
.
<EOS>
I
do
on
that
occasion
,
what
I
think
my
duty
towards
my
fellow
-
creature
.
  
<EOS>
I
write
to
a
physician
of
my
acquaintance
,
who
be
humane
enough
to
visit
the
poor
little
patient
:
<EOS>
I
engage
a
careful
woman
-
prisoner
as
a
nurse
,
and
Mr
Norton
supply
them
with
money
and
necessary
.
   
<EOS>
these
help
be
barely
sufficient
to
preserve
them
from
the
horror
of
despair
,
when
they
see
their
little
darling
pant
under
the
rage
of
a
loathsome
pestilential
malady
,
during
the
excessive
heat
of
the
dog
-
day
,
and
struggle
for
breath
in
the
noxious
atmosphere
of
a
confine
cabin
,
where
they
scarce
have
room
to
turn
,
on
the
most
necessary
occasion
.
<EOS>
the
eager
curiosity
with
which
the
mother
eye
the
doctor
's
look
as
often
as
he
visit
the
boy
;
the
terror
and
trepidation
of
the
father
,
while
he
desire
to
know
his
opinion
;
in
a
word
,
the
whole
tenour
of
their
distress
baffle
all
description
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
,
the
physician
,
for
the
sake
of
his
own
character
,
be
oblige
to
be
explicit
;
and
return
with
the
captain
to
the
common
walk
,
tell
him
,
in
my
hearing
,
that
the
child
could
not
possibly
recover
.
  
<EOS>
this
sentence
seem
to
have
petrify
the
unfortunate
parent
,
who
stand
motionless
,
and
seemingly
bereft
of
sense
.
   
<EOS>
I
lead
him
to
my
apartment
,
where
he
sit
a
full
hour
in
that
state
of
stupefaction
;
then
he
begin
to
groan
hideously
;
a
shower
of
tear
burst
from
his
eye
;
he
throw
himself
on
the
floor
,
and
utter
the
most
piteous
lamentation
that
ever
be
hear

the

this
exclamation

pronounce
these

:
"
Tommy

<EOS>
this
address
deprive
the
wretched
mother
of
all
resignation
to
the
will
of
Providence
.
<EOS>
She
tear
her
hair
,
dash
herself
on
the
pavement
,
shriek
aloud
,
and
be
carry
off
in
a
deplorable
state
of
distraction
.
   
<EOS>
that
same
evening
the
lovely
babe
expire
,
and
the
father
grow
frantic
.
<EOS>
He
make
an
attempt
on
his
own
life
;
and
be
with
difficulty
restrain
,
his
agitation
sink
into
a
kind
of
sudden
insensibility
,
which
seem
to
absorb
all
sentiment
,
and
gradually
vulgarize
his
faculty
of
thinking
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
dissipate
the
violence
of
his
sorrow
,
he
continually
shift
the
scene
from
one
company
to
another
,
contract
abundance
of
low
connexion
,
and
drown
his
care
in
repeat
intoxication
.
<EOS>
the
unhappy
lady
undergo
a
long
series
of
hysterical
fit
and
other
complaint
,
which
seem
to
have
a
fatal
effect
on
her
brain
as
well
as
constitution
.
<EOS>
cordial
be
administre
to
keep
up
her
spirit
;
and
she
find
it
necessary
to
protract
the
use
of
them
to
blunt
the
edge
of
grief
,
by
overwhelming
reflexion
,
and
remove
the
sense
of
uneasiness
arise
from
a
disorder
in
her
stomach
.
   
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
she
become
an
habitual
dram
-
drinker
;
and
this
practice
expose
her
to
such
communication
as
debauch
her
reason
,
and
pervert
her
sense
of
decorum
and
propriety
.
<EOS>
She
and
her
husband
give
a
loose
to
vulgar
excess
,
in
which
they
be
enable
to
indulge
by
the
charity
and
interest
of
some
friend
,
who
obtain
half
-
pay
for
the
captain
.
<EOS>
They
be
now
metamorphose
into
the
shocking
creature
you
have
see
;
he
into
a
riotous
plebeian
,
and
she
into
a
ragged
trull
.
<EOS>
They
be
both
drunk
every
day
,
quarrel
and
fight
one
with
another
,
and
often
insult
their
fellow
-
prisoner
.
<EOS>
yet
they
be
not
wholly
abandon
by
virtue
and
humanity
.
<EOS>
the
captain
be
scrupulously
honest
in
all
his
dealing
,
and
pay
off
his
debt
punctually
every
quarter
,
as
soon
as
he
receive
his
half
-
pay
.
<EOS>
every
prisoner
in
distress
be
welcome
to
share
his
money
while
it
last
;
and
his
wife
never
fail
,
while
it
be
in
her
power
,
to
relieve
the
wretched
;
so
that
their
generosity
,
even
in
this
miserable
disguise
,
be
universally
respect
by
their
neighbour
.
   
<EOS>
sometimes
the
recollection
of
their
former
rank
come
over
them
like
a
qualm
,
which
they
dispel
with
brandy
,
and
then
humorously
rally
one
another
on
their
mutual
degeneracy
.
<EOS>
She
often
stop
me
in
the
walk
,
and
,
point
to
the
captain

say
,
"
<EOS>
My
husband

<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
he
will
frequently
desire
me
to
take
notice
of
his
rib
,
as
she
chance
to
pass

<EOS>
"
mind
that
draggle

her
to
this
pass

<EOS>
thus
they
accommodate
themselves
to
each
other
's
infirmity
,
and
pass
their
time
not
without
some
taste
of
plebeian
enjoyment
 
but
,
name
their

,
they
never
fail
to
burst
into

a
return
of
the
most
poignant
sorrow

when

the
company
he
have
be
teaze
by
a
very
importunate
beggar

<EOS>
address
himself
to
our
adventurer
,
"
You
take
notice
(
say
he
)
of
a
fine
lady
flaunt
about
our
walk
in
all
the
frippery
of
the
fashion
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
lately
a
gay
young
widow
that
make
a
great
figure
at
the
court
end
of
the
town
;
she
distinguish
herself
by
her
splendid
equipage
,
her
rich
livery
,
her
brilliant
assembly
,
her
numerous
rout
,
and
her
elegant
taste
in
dress
and
furniture
.
<EOS>
She
be
nearly
relate
to
some
of
the
good
family
in
England
,
and
,
it
must
be
own
,
mistress
of
many
fine
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
but
be
deficient
in
true
delicacy
,
she
endeavour
to
hide
that
defect
by
affectation
.
<EOS>
She
pretend
to
a
thousand
antipathy
which
do
not
belong
to
her
nature
.
<EOS>
a
breast
of
veal
throw
her
into
mortal
agony
.
<EOS>
if
she
see
a
spider
she
scream
;
and
at
sight
of
a
mouse
she
faint
away
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
without
horror
behold
an
entire
joint
of
meat
;
and
nothing
but
fricassee
and
other
make
-
dish
be
see
upon
her
table
.
<EOS>
She
cause
all
her
floor
to
be
line
with
green
bay
,
that
she
may
trip
along
them
with
more
ease
and
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Her
footman
wear
clog
,
which
be
deposit
in
the
hall
,
and
both
they
and
her
chairman
be
lay
under
the
strong
injunction
to
avoid
porter
and
tobacco
.
   
<EOS>
Her
jointure
amount
to
eight
hundred
pound
per
annum
,
and
she
make
shift
to
spend
four
time
that
sum
:
at
lenght
it
be
mortgage
for
nearly
the
entire
value
;
but
,
far
from
retrench
<EOS>
,
she
seem
to
increase
in
extravagance
until
her
effect
be
take
in
execution
,
and
her
person
here
deposit
in
safe
custody
.
<EOS>
when
one
consider
the
abrupt
transition
she
undergo
from
her
spacious
apartment
to
an
hovel
scarce
eight
foot
square
;
from
sumptuous
furniture
to
bare
bench
;
from
magnificence
to
meanness
;
from
affluence
to
extreme
poverty
;
one
would
imagine
she
must
have
be
totally
overwhelm
by
such
a
sudden
gush
of
misery
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
the
case
:
she
have
,
in
fact
,
no
delicate
feeling
.
<EOS>
She
forthwith
accommodate
herself
to
the
exigency
of
her
fortune
;
yet
she
still
affect
to
keep
state
amidst
the
misery
of
a
goal
;
and
this
affectation
be
truly
ridiculous
.
  
<EOS>
She
lie
a
-
bed
till
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
:
she
maintain
a
female
attendant
for
the
sole
purpose
of
dress
her
person
.
<EOS>
Her
cabin
be
the
least
cleanly
in
the
whole
prison
;
she
have
learn
to
eat
bread
and
cheese
,
and
drink
porter
;
but
she
always
appear
once
a
day
dress
in
the
pink
of
the
fashion
.
   
<EOS>
She
have
find
mean
to
run
in
debt
at
the
chandler
's
shop
,
the
baker
's
,
and
the
tap

house
,
tho
'
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
get
in
this
place
but
with
ready
money
:
she
have
even
borrow
small
sum
from
diver
prisoner
,
who
be
themselves
on
the
brink
of
starve
.
<EOS>
She
take
pleasure
in
be
surround
with
dun
,
observe
,
that
by
such
people
a
person
of
fashion
be
to
be
distinguish
.
<EOS>
She
write
circular
letter
to
her
former
friend
and
acquaintance
,
and
by
this
method
have
raise
pretty
considerable
contribution
;
for
she
write
in
a
most
elegant
and
irresistible
stile
.
<EOS>
about
a
fortnight
ago
she
receive
a
supply
of
twenty
guinea
;
when
,
instead
of
pay
her
little
goal
-
debt
,
or
withdraw
any
part
of
her
apparel
from
pawn
,
she
lay
out
the
whole
sum
in
a
fashionable
suit
and
lace
;
and
next
day
borrow
of
me
a
shilling
to
purchase
a
neck
of
mutton
for
her
dinner
  
<EOS>
She
seem
to
think
her
rank
in
life
intitle
her
to
this
kind
of
assistance
.
<EOS>
She
talk
very
pompously
of
her
family
and
connexion
,
by
whom
,
however
,
she
have
be
long
renounce
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
sympathy
nor
compassion
for
the
distress
of
her
fellow
-
creature
;
but
she
be
perfectly
well
breed
;
she
bear
a
repulse
the
good
of
any
woman
I
ever
know
;
and
her
temper
have
never
be
once
ruffle
since
her
arrival
at
the
King's
-
bench
 
She
now
intreate
me
to
lend
her
half
a
guinea
,
for
which
she
say
she
have
the
most
pressing
occasion
,
and
promise
upon
her
honour
it
should
be
repay
tomorrow
;
but
I
lend
a
deaf
ear
to
her
request
,
and
tell
her
in
plain
term
that
her
honour
be
already
bankrupt
.

Sir
Launcelot
thrust
his

mechanically
into
his

pull
out
a
couple
of
guinea

God

here
you

in
the
solitary
recess
of
indigence

disdain
to

even
ashamed
to

here
you

do
not

reject

<EOS>
Her

maintain
the
family
for
some
time

but
it
be
not

human
charity
to
persevere

some

unfortunate

without

three
whole
day
have
our
adventurer
prosecute
his
inquiry
about
the
amiable
Aurelia

whom
he
seek
in
every
place
of
public
and
of
private
entertainment
,
or
resort
,
without
obtain
the
least
satisfactory
intelligence
,
when
he
receive
one
evening
,
from
the
hand
of
a
porter
,
who
instantly
vanish
,
the
following
billet
:
"
if
you
would
learn
the
particular
of
Miss
Darnel
's
fate
,
fail
not
to
be
in
the
field
by
the
Foundling
Hospital
,
precisely
at
seven
o'clock
this
evening
,
when
you
shall
be
meet
by
a
person
who
will
give
you
the
satisfaction
you
desire
,
together
with
his
reason
for
address
you
in
this
mysterious
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
   
have
this
intimation
concern
any
other
subject
,
perhaps
the
knight
would
have
deliberate
with
himself
in
what
manner
he
should
take
a
hint
so
darkly
communicate
:
but
his
eagerness
to
retrieve
the
jewel
he
have
lose
,
divest
him
of
all
his
caution
;
the
time
of
assignation
be
already
at
hand
,
and
neither
the
captain
nor
his
nephew
could
be
find
to
accompany
him
,
have
he
be
dispose
to
make
use
of
their
attendance
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
repair
to
the
place
appoint
,
in
the
utmost
agitation
and
anxiety
,
lest
the
hour
should
be
elapse
before
his
arrival
.
   
<EOS>
Crowe
be
one
of
those
defective
spirit
,
who
can
not
subsist
for
any
length
of
time
on
their
own
bottom
.
<EOS>
He
want
a
familiar
prop
,
upon
which
he
could
disburthen
his
care
,
his
doubt
,
and
his
humour
:
an
humble
friend
who
would
endure
his
caprice
,
and
with
whom
he
could
communicate
,
free
of
all
reserve
and
restraint
.
   
<EOS>
though
he
love
his
nephew
's
person
,
and
admire
his
part
,
he
consider
him
often
as
a
little
petulant
jackanape
,
who
presume
upon
his
superior
understanding
;
and
as
for
Sir
Launcelot
,
there
be
something
in
his
character
that
overawe
the
seaman
,
and
keep
him
at
a
disagreeable
distance
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
in
this
dilemma
,
cast
his
eye
upon
Timothy
Crabshaw
,
and
admit
him
to
a
considerable
share
of
familiarity
and
fellowship
.
<EOS>
these
companion
have
be
emyloye
in
smoake
a
social
pipe
at
an
alehouse
in
the
neighbourhood
,
when
the
knight
make
his
excursion
;
and
return
to
the
house
about
supper
-
time
,
find
Mr
Clarke
in
wait
.
<EOS>
the
young
lawyer
be
alarm
when
he
hear
the
hour
of
ten
,
without
see
our
adventurer
,
who
have
be
use
to
be
extremely
regular
in
his
oeconomy
;
and
the
captain
and
he
sup
in
profound
silence
.
   
<EOS>
finding
,
upon
enquiry
among
the
servant
,
that
the
knight
go
out
abruptly
,
in
consequence
of
have
receive
a
billet
,
Tom
begin
to
be
visit
with
the
apprehension
of
a
duel
,
and
sit
the
good
part
of
the
night
by
his
uncle
,
sweat
with
the
expectation
of
see
our
hero
bring
home
a
breathless
corse
:
but
no
tiding
of
him
arrive
,
he
,
about
two
in
the
morning
,
repair
to
his
own
lodging
,
resolve
to
publish
a
description
of
Sir
Launcelot
in
the
news
-
paper
,
if
he
should
not
appear
next
day
.
<EOS>
Crowe
do
not
pass
the
time
without
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
He
be
extremely
concerned
at
the
thought
of
some
mischief
have
befall
his
friend
and
patron
;
and
he
be
terrified
with
the
apprehension
,
that
in
case
Sir
Launcelot
be
murder
,
his
spirit
may
come
and
give
him
notice
of
his
fate
.
<EOS>
now
he
have
an
insuperable
aversion
to
all
correspondence
with
the
dead
;
and
take
it
for
grant
,
that
the
spirit
of
his
depart
friend
could
not
appear
to
him
except
when
he
should
be
alone
,
and
a

bed
in
the
dark
,
he
determine
to
pass
the
remainder
of
the
night
without
go
to

.
<EOS>
for
this
purpose
his
first
care
be
to
visit
the
garret
,
in
which
Timothy
Crabshaw
lie
fast
asleep
,
snore
with
his
mouth
wide
open
.
   
<EOS>
Him
the
captain
with
difficulty
rouse
,
by
dint
of
promising
to
regale
him
with
a
bowl
of
rum
punch
in
the
kitchen
,
where
the
fire
,
which
have
be
extinguish
,
be
soon
rekindle
.
<EOS>
the
ingredient
be
fetch
from
a
public
-
house
in
the
neighbourhood
;
for
the
captain
be
too
proud
to
use
his
interest
in
the
knight
's
family
,
especially
at
these
hour
when
all
the
rest
of
the
servant
have
retire
to
their
repose
;
and
he
and
Timothy
drink
together
until
day
-
break
,
the
conversation
turn
upon
hobgoblin
,
and
God
's
revenge
against
murder
.
<EOS>
the
cookmaid
lie
in
a
little
apartment
contiguous
to
the
kitchen
;
and
whether
disturb
by
these
horrible
tale
of

,
or
titillate
by
the
savoury
steam
that

she
make
a

,
or
appetite
,
and
dress
herself
in
the
dark
,
suddenly
appear
before
them
,
to
the
no
small
perturbation
of
both
.
   
<EOS>
Timothy
,
in
particular
,
be
so
startled
,
that
in
his
endeavour
to
make
an
hasty
retreat
towards
the
chimney
corner
,
he
overturn
the
table
;
the
liquor
be
spill
,
but
the
bowl
be
save
by
fall
on
a
heap
of
ashe
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Cook
have
reprimand
him
for
his
foolish
fear
,
declare
she
have
get
up
betime
,
in
order
to
scour
her
saucepan
;
and
the
captain
propose
to
have
the
bowl
replenish
,
if
material
could
be
procure
.
<EOS>
this
difficulty
be
overcome
by
Crabshaw
;
and
they
sit
down
with
their
new
associate
to
discuss
the
second
edition
.
<EOS>
the
knight
's
sudden
disappearing
be
bring
upon
the
carpet
,
their
female
companion
give
it
as
her
opinion
,
that
nothing
would
be
so
likely
to
bring
this
affair
to
light
,
as
go
to
a
cunning
man
,
whom
she
have
lately
consult
about
a
silver
spoon
that
be
mislay
,
and
who
tell
her
all
the
thing
that
she
ever
do
,
and
ever
would
happen
to
her
through
the
whole
course
of
her
life
.
   
<EOS>
Her
two
companion
prick
up
their
ear
at
this
intelligence
;
and
Crowe
ask
if
the
spoon
have
be
find
?
   
<EOS>
She
answer
in
the
affirmative
,
and
say
,
the
cunning
man
describe
to
a
hair
the
person
that
should
be
her
true
love
,
and
her
wedded
husband
:
that
he
be
a
sea
-
fare
man
;
that
he
be
pretty
well
stricken
in
year
;
a
little
passionate
or
so
;
and
that
he
go
with
his
finger
clinch
like
,
as
it
be
.
<EOS>
the
captain
begin
to
sweat
at
this
description
,
and
mechanically
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
,
while
Crabshaw
,
point
to
him
,
tell
her
he
believe
she
have
get
the
right
sow
by
the
ear
.
<EOS>
Crowe
grumble
,
that
may
hap
for
all
that
he
should
not
be
bring
up
by
such
a
grapple
neither
.
<EOS>
then
he
ask
if
this
cunning
man
deal
with
the
devil
,
declaring
,
in
that
case
he
would
keep
clear
of
him
:
<EOS>
for
why
?
<EOS>
because
he
must
have
sell
himself
to
old
scratch
;
and
be
a
servant
of
the
devil
,
how
could
he
be
a
good
subject
to
his
majesty
?
<EOS>
Mrs
Cook
assure
him
,
the
conjurer
be
a
good
christian
;
and
that
he
gain
all
his
knowledge
by
converse
with
the
star
and
planet
.
   
<EOS>
thus
satisfied
,
the
two
friend
resolve
to
consult
him
as
soon
as
it
should
be
light
;
and
be
direct
to
the
place
of
his
habitation
,
set
out
for
it
by
seven
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
They
find
the
house
forsake
,
and
have
already
reach
the
end
of
the
lane
in
their
return
,
when
they
be
accost
by
an
old
woman
,
who
give
them
to
understand
,
that
if
they
have
occasion
for
the
advice
of
a
fortune
-
teller
,
as
she
do
suppose
they
have
,
from
their
stopping
at
the
house
where
Dr
Grubble
live
,
she
would
conduct
them
to
a
person
of
much
more
eminence
in
that
profession
;
at
the
same
time
she
inform
them
,
that
the
say
Grubble
have
be
lately

to
bride
-
well
;
a
circumstance
which
,
with
all
his
art
,
he
have
not
be
able
to
foresee
.
   
<EOS>
the
captain
,
without
any
scruple
,
put
himself
and
his
companion
under
convoy
of
this
beldame
,
who
,
through
many
winding
and
turning
,
bring
them
to
the
door
of
a
ruinous
house
,
stand
in
a
blind
alley
;
which
door
have
open
with
a
key
draw
from
her
pocket
,
she
introduce
them
into
a
parlour
,
where
they
see
no
other
furniture
than
a
naked
bench
,
and
some
frightful
figure
on
the
bare
wall
,
draw
,
or
rather
scrawl
with
charcoal
.
<EOS>
here
she
leave
them
lock
in
,
until
she
should
give
the
doctor
notice
of
their
arrival
;
and
they
amuse
themselves
with
decyphere
these
character
and
hieroglyphic
.
<EOS>
the
first
figure
that
engage
their
attention
,
be
that
of
a
man
hang
upon
a
gibbet
,
which
both
consider
as
an
unfavourable
oman
,
and
each
endeavour
to
avert
from
his
own
person
.
<EOS>
Crabshaw
observe
,
that
the
figure
so
suspend
be
cloathe
in
a
sailor
's
jacket
and
trowser
;
a
truth
which
the
captain
could
not
deny
;
but
on
the
other
hand
he
affirm
,
that
the
say
figure
exhibit
the
very
nose
and
chin
of
Timothy
,
together
with
the
hump
on
one
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
a
warm
dispute
ensue
;
and
be
maintain
with
much
acrimonious
altercation
,
may
have
dissolve
the
new
-
cemented
friendship
of
these
two
original
,
have
it
not
be
interrupt
by
the
old
sybil
,
who
,
come
into
the
parlour
,
intimate
that
the
doctor
wait
for
them
above
.
<EOS>
She
likewise
tell
them
that
he
never
admit
more
than
one
at
a
time
.
<EOS>
this
hint
occasion
a
fresh
contest
:
the
captain
insist
upon
Crabshaw
's
make
sail
a
-
head
,
in
order
to
look
out
afore
;
but
Timothy
persist
in
refuse
this
honour
,
declare
he
do
not
pretend
to
lead
,
but
he
would
follow
,
as
in
duty
bind
.
<EOS>
the
old
gentlewoman
abridge
the
ceremony
,
by
lead
out
Crabshaw
with
one
hand
,
and
lock
up
Crowe
with
the
other
.
<EOS>
the
former
be
drag
up
stair
like
a
bear
to
the
stake
,
not
without
reluctance
and
terror
,
which
do
not
at
all
abate
at
sight
of
the
conjurer
,
with
whom
he
be
immediately
shut
up
by
his
conductress
;
after
she
have
tell
him
in
a
whisper
,
that
he

and
thigh

on
a

.
   
<EOS>
the
squire
have
make
this
offering
with
fear
and
tremble
,
venture
to
survey
the
object
around
him
,
which
be
very
well
calculated
to
augment
his
confusion
.
<EOS>
He
see
diver
skeleton
hang
by
the
head
;
the
stuff
skin
of
a
young
alligator
,
a
calf
with
two

and
several
snake
suspend
from
the
cieling
,
with
the

of
a

,
and
a

.
<EOS>
on
another
funereal
table
he
behold
two
sphere

between
which
lie
a
book
open
,
exhibit
outlandish
character
,
and
mathematical

<EOS>
on
one
side

an
ink
-
standish
with
paper
,
and
behind
this
desk
appear
the
conjurer
himself
in
sable
vestment
,
his
head
so
overshadowed
with
hair
,
that
,
far
from
contemplate
his
feature
,
Timothy
could
distinguish
nothing
but
a
long
white
beard
,
which
,
for
ought
he
know
,
may
have
belong
to
a
four
-
legged
goat
,
as
well
as
to
a
two

legged
astrologer
.
   
<EOS>
this
apparition
,
which
the
squire
do
not

without
manifest
discomposure
,
extend
a
white
wand
,
make
certain
evolution
over
the
head
of
Timothy
,
and
have
mutter
an
ejaculation
,
command
him
,
in
a
hollow
tone
,
to
come
forward
and
declare
his
name
.
<EOS>
Crabshaw
thus
adjure
advanced
to
the
altar
;
and
whether
from
design
,
or
(
which
be
more
probable
)
from
confusion
,
answer
"

<EOS>
the
conjurer
take

him
to
sit
down

compose
himself
until

a

the

wave
his
wand

repeat
abundance
of
gibberish

,
the

with
their

and

<EOS>
when
he
perceive
that
this
artifice
have
its
proper
effect
in
disturb
the
brain
of
Crabshaw
,
he
proceed
to
tell
him
from
the
star
,
that
his
name
be
Crabshaw
,
or
Crabsclaw
;
that
he
be
bear
in
the
Eastriding
of
Yorkshire
,
of
poor
,
yet
honest
parent
,
and
have
some
skill
in
horse
;
that
he
serve
a
gentleman
,
whose
name
begin
with
the
letter
<EOS>
G
  
,
which
gentleman
have
run
mad
for
love
,
and
leave
his
family
;
but
whether
he
would
return
alive
or
dead
<EOS>
the
star
have
not
yet
determine
.
<EOS>
Poor
Timothy
be
thunderstruck
to
find
the
conjurer
acquaint
with
all
these
circumstance
,
and
beg
to
know
if
he
mought
be
so
bauld
<EOS>
as
to
ax
a
question
or
two
about
his
own
fortune
.
<EOS>
the
astrologer
point
to
the
little
coffin
,
our
squire
understand
the
hint
,
and
deposit
another
shilling
.
<EOS>
the
sage
have
recourse
to
his
book
,
erect
another
scheme
,
perform
once
more
his
airy
evolution
with
the
wand
,
and
have
recite
another
mystical
preamble
,
expound
the
book
of
fate
in
these
word
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
shall
neither
die
by
war
nor
water
,
by
hunger
or
by
thirst
,
nor
be
bring
to
the
grave
by
old
age
or
distemper
;
but
<EOS>
,
let
me
see
 
<EOS>
ay
,
the
star
will
have
it
<EOS>
so
  
you
shall
be
 
exalted
 
<EOS>
hah
!
 
<EOS>
ay
,
that
is
 
hang
for
horse
-
steal
"
  
"
<EOS>
o
,
good
<EOS>
my
lord
conjurer
!
<EOS>
(
roar
the
squire
)
<EOS>
I
would
as
lief
give
forty
shilling
as
be
hang
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Peace
,
sirrah
!
<EOS>
(
cry
the
other
)
<EOS>
would
you
contradict
or
reverse
the
immutable
decree
of
fate
.
<EOS>
hang
be
your
destiny
;
and
hang
you
shall
be
 
and
comfort
yourself
with
the
reflection
,
that
as
you
be
not
the
first
,
so
neither
will
you
be
the
last
to
swing
on
tyburn
-
tree
.
"
<EOS>
this
comfortable
assurance
compose
the
mind
of
Timothy
,
and
in
a
great
measure
reconcile
him
to
the
prediction
.
<EOS>
He
now
proceed
in
a
whine
tone
,
to
ask
whether
he
should
suffer
for
the
first
fact
?
<EOS>
whether
it
would
be
for
a
horse
or
a
mare
?
<EOS>
and
of
what
colour
?
<EOS>
that
he
may
know
when
his
hour
be
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
conjurer
gravely
answer
,
that
he
would
steal
a
dapple
gelding
on
a
Wednesday
;
be
cast
at
the
Old
Baily
on
Thursday
,
and
suffer
on
a
Friday
;
and
he
strenuously
recommend
it
to
him
,
to
appear
in
the
cart
with
a
nosegay
in
one
hand
,
and
the
Whole
Duty
of
Man
in
the
other
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
but
if
in
case
it
should
be
in
the
winter
(
say
the
squire
)
<EOS>
when
a
nosegay
can
not
be
have
"
 
why
then
(
reply
the
conjurer
)
an
orange
will
do
as
well
.
"
<EOS>
these
material
point
be
adjust
to
the
entire
satisfaction
of
Timothy
,
he
declare
he
would
bestow
another
shilling
to
know
the
fortune
of
an
old
companion
,
who
truly
do
not
deserve
so
much
at
his
hand
;
but
he
could
not
help
love
him
better
than
e'er
a
friend
he
have
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
drop
a
third
offering
in
the
coffin
,
and
desire
to
know
the
fate
of
his
horse
Gilbert
.
<EOS>
the
astrologer
have
again
consult
his
art
,
pronounce
,
that
Gilbert
would
die
of
the
stagger
,
and
his
carcase
be
give
to
the
hound
;
a
sentence
,
which
make
a
much
deep
impression
upon
Crabshaw
's
mind
,
than
do
the
prediction
of
his
own
untimely
and
disgraceful
fate
.
   
<EOS>
He
shed
a
plenteous
shower
of
tear
,
and
his
grief
break
forth
in
some
passionate
expression
of
tenderness
:
 
at
length
he
tell
the
astrologer
he
would
go
and
send
up
the
captain
,
who
want
to
consult
him
about
Margery
Cook
,
because
as
how
she
have
inform
him
that
Dr
Grubble
have
describe
just
such
another
man
as
the
captain
for
her
true
love
;
and
he
have
no
great
stomach
to
the
match
,
if
so
be
as
the
star
be
not
bent
upon
their
come
together
.
<EOS>
accordingly
the
squire
be
dismiss
by
the
conjurer
,
descend
to
the
parlour
with
a
rueful
length
of
face
;
which
be
perceive
by
the
captain
<EOS>
,
he
demand
"
<EOS>
what
cheer
,
ho
?
<EOS>
"
with
some
sign
of
apprehension
.
<EOS>
Crabshaw
make
no
return
to
this
salute
,
he
ask
if
the
conjurer
have
take
an
observation
,
and
tell
him
any
thing
?
<EOS>
then
the
other
reply
,
he
have
tell
him
more
than
he
desire
to
know
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
an
that
be
the
case
,
(
say
the
seaman
)
<EOS>
I
have
no
occasion
to
go
aloft
this
trip
,
brother
.
<EOS>
"
this
evasion
would
not
serve
his
turn
:
old
Tisiphone
be
at
hand
,
and
lead
him
up
growl
into
the
hall
of
audience
,
which
he
do
not
examine
without
trepidation
.
   
<EOS>
have
be
direct
to
the
coffin
,
where
he
present
half
a
crown
,
in
hope
of
render
the
fate
more
propitious
,
the
usual
ceremony
be
perform
;
and
the
doctor
address
him
in
these
word
:
"
Approach

"
<EOS>
the
captain

,
"
You

<EOS>

he
)

your

the

<EOS>
thou

denunciation

I

be
by
no

pleased

either
with
the
matter

the
manner
of
this
address

<EOS>
He
therefore
begin
to
soothe
the
captain
's
choler
,
by
represent
that
he
do
not
pretend
to
omniscience
,
which
be
the
attribute
of
God
alone
;
that
human
art
be
fallible
and
imperfect
;
and
all
that
it
could
perform
,
be
to
discover
certain
partial
circumstance
of
any
particular
object
to
which
its
enquiry
be
direct
:
that
be
question
by
the
other
man

concern
the
cause
of
his
master
's
disappearing
,
he
have
exercise
his
skill
upon
the
subject
,
and
find
reason
to
believe
that
Sir
Launcelot
be
assassinate
;
that
he
should
think
himself
happy
in
be
the
instrument
of
bring
the
murderer
to
justice
,
though
he
foresee
they
would
of
themselves
save
him
that
trouble
;
for
they
would
quarrel
about
divide
the
spoil
,
and
one
would
give
information
against
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
the
prospect
of
this
satisfaction
appease
the
resentment
,
and
,
in
some
measure
,
mitigate
the
grief
of
captain
Crowe
,
who
take
his
leave
without
much
ceremony
;
and
be
join
by
Crabshaw
,
proceed
with
a
heavy
heart
to
the
house
of
Sir
Launcelot
,
where
they
find
the
domestic
at
breakfast
,
without
exhibit
the
least
symptom
of
concern
for
their
absent
master

<EOS>
Crowe
have
be
wise
enough
to
conceal
from
Crabshaw
what
he
have
learn
of
the
knight
's
fate
.
<EOS>
this
fatal
intelligence
he
reserve
for
the
ear
of
his
nephew

Mr
Clarke
,
who
do
not
fail
to
attend
him
in
the
forenoon

as
for

squire

he
do
nothing

ruminate
in
rueful
silence
upon
the
dapple
gelding
,
the
nosegay
,
and
the
predict
fate
of
Gilbert

<EOS>
Him
he
forthwith
visit
in
the
stable
,
and
salute
with
the
kiss
of
peace
.
<EOS>
then
he
bemoan
his
fortune
with
tear

the
sound

lamentation

the
cloud
that

the
catastrophe
begin
to
disperse

<EOS>
We
must
now
leave
Capt
Crowe
and
his
nephew
Mr
Clarke
,
argue
with
great
vehemence
about
the
fatal
intelligence
obtain
from
the
conjurer
,
and
penetrate
at
once
the
veil
that
conceal
our
hero
.
   
<EOS>
know
then
,
reader
,
that
Sir
Launcelot
Greaves
,
repair
to
the
place
describe
in
the
billet
which
he
have
receive
,
be
accost
by
a
person
muffle
in
a
cloak
,
who
begin
to
amuse
him
with
a
feign
story
of
Aurelia
;
<EOS>
to
which
,
while
he
listen
with
great
attention
,
he
find
himself
suddenly
surround
by
armed
man
,
who
seize
and
pinion
down
his
arm
,
take
away
his
sword
,
and
convey
him
by
force
into
a
hackney
-
coach
provide
for
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
in
vain
he
expostulate
on
this
violence
with
three
person
who
accompany
him
in
the
vehicle
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
extort
one
word
by
way
of
reply
;
and
,
from
their
gloomy
aspect
,
he
begin
to
be
apprehensive
of
assassination
.
<EOS>
have
the
carriage
pass
through
any
unfrequented
place
,
he
would
have
endeavour
to
alarm
the
inhabitant
;
but
it
be
already
clear
of
the
town
,
and
his
conductor
take
care
to
avoid
all
village
and
inhabited
house
.
   
<EOS>
after
have
travel
about
two
mile
,
the
coach
stop
at
a
large
iron
-
gate
,
which
be
open
,
our
adventurer
be
lead
in
silence
thro

a
spacious
house
into
a
tolerably
decent
apartment
,
which
he
understand
be
intend
for
his
bed
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
after
his
arrival
,
he
be
visit
by
a
man
of
no
very
prepossessing
appearance
,
who
endeavour
to
smoothe
his
countenance
,
which
be
naturally
stern
,
welcome
our
adventurer
to
his
house
;
exhort
him
to
be
of
good
cheer
,
assure
him
he
should
want
for
nothing
;
and
desire
to
know
what
he
would
choose
for
supper
.
   
<EOS>
Sir
Launcelot
,
in
answer
to
this
civil
address
,
beg
he
would
explain
the
nature
of
his
confinement
,
and
the
reason
for
which
his
arm
be
tie
like
those
of
the
bad
malefactor
.
<EOS>
the
other
postpone
till
tomorrow
the
explanation
he
demand
;
but
,
in
the
mean
time
,
unbound
his
fetter
,
and
as
he
decline
eat
,
leave
him
alone
to
his
repose
.
<EOS>
He
take
care
,
however
,
in
retire
,
to
double

lock
the
door
of
the
room
,
whose
window
be

<EOS>
the
knight

be
thus
abandon
to
his
own
meditation
,
begin
to
ruminate
on
the
present
adventure
with
equal
surprize
and
concern
;
but
the
more
he
revolve
circumstance
,
the
more
be
he
perplex
in
his
conjecture
.
<EOS>
accord
to
the
state
of
the
mind
,
a
very
subtle
philosopher
be
often
puzzle
by
a
very
plain
proposition
;
and
this
be
the
case
of
our
adventurer
 
<EOS>
what
make
the
strong
impression
upon
his
mind
,
be
a
notion
that
he
be
apprehend
on
suspicion
of
treasonable
practice
,
by
a
warrant
from
the
secretary
of
state
,
in
consequence
of
some
false
malicious
information
;
and
that
his
prison
be
no
other
than
the
house
of
a
messenger
,
set
apart
for
the
accommodation
of
suspect
person
.
<EOS>
in
this
opinion
,
he
comfort
himself
by
recollect
his
own
conscious

Our

and
the
more
he
reflect
on
his
situation
,
the
more
he
be
overwhelmed
with
the
most
perplexing
chagrin
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
conceive
by
whose
mean
he
have
be
immure
in
a
mad

house
;
but
he
heartily
repent
of
his
knight

errantry
,
as
a
frolic
which
may
have
very
serious
consequence
,
with
respect
to
his
future
life

fortune

<EOS>
after
mature
deliberation
,
he
resolve
to
demean
himself
with
the
utmost
circumspection
,
well
know
that
every
violent
transport
would
be
interpret
into
an
undeniable
symptom
of
insanity

<EOS>
He
be
not
without
hope
of
be
able
to
move
his
jailor
by
a
due
administration
of
that
which
be
generally
more
efficacious
than
all
the
flower
of
elocution

but
when
he
rise
in
the
morning
,
he
find
his
pocket
have
be
carefully
examine
,
and
empty
of
all
his
paper

cash

<EOS>
the
keeper
entering
,
he
enquire
about
these
particular
,

be
give
to
understand
that
they
be
all
safely
deposit
for

to

but
,
at

,
as
he
should
want
for
nothing
,
he
have
no
occasion
for
money

<EOS>
the
knight
acquiesce
in
this
declaration
,
and
eat
his
breakfast
in
quiet
.
<EOS>
about
eleven
,
he
receive
a
visit
from
the
physician

who
contemplate
his

great
solemnity

Doctor

you
have

no

of

tho

that
be
a
very
inaccurate
expression

for
this
phrase

denote
a
morbid
excess
of

seem
to
imply
that

itself
be

the
loose

constitute
the
nervous
substance

the
quantity

must
be
proportionable

now
you
will

take
notice

<EOS>
so
say
,
he
return
,
and
our
adventurer
could
not
but
think
it
be
very
hard
that
one
man
should
not
dare
to
ask
the
most
ordinary
question
without
be
repute
mad
,
while
another
should
talk
nonsense
by
the
hour
,
and
yet
be
esteem
as
an
oracle
  
<EOS>
the
master
of
the
house
find
Sir
Launcelot
so
tame
and
tractable
,
indulge
him
after
dinner
with
a
walk
in
a
little
private
garden
,
under
the
eye
of
a
servant
who
follow
him
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
here
he
be
salute
by
a
brother
prisoner

a
man
seemingly
turn
of
thirty
,
tall
and
thin
,
with
stare
eye
,
a
hook

nose
,
and
a
face
cover
with
pimple

<EOS>
the
usual
compliment
have
pass
,
the
stranger
,
without
further
ceremony
,
ask
if
he
would
oblige
him
with
a
chew
of
tobacco
,
or
could
spare
him
a
mouthful
of
any
sort
of
cordial
,
declare
he
have
not
taste
brandy
since
he
come
to
the
house
  
<EOS>
the
knight
assure
him
it
be
not
in
his
power
to
comply
with
his
request
;
and
begin
to
ask
some
question
relate
to
the
character
of
their
landlord
,
which
the
stranger
represent
in
very
unfavourable
colour
.
<EOS>
He
describe
him
as
a
ruffian
,
capable
of
undertake
the
dark
scheme
of
villainy
.
   
<EOS>
He
say
his
house
be
a
repository
of
the
most
flagrant
iniquitie
:
that
it
contain
father
kidnap
by
their
child
,
wife
confine
by
their
husband
,
gentleman
of
fortune
sequester
by
their
relation
,
and
innocent
person
immure
by
the
malice
of
their
adversary
.
<EOS>
He
affirm
this
be
his
own
case
;
and
ask
if
our
hero
have
never
hear
of
Dick
Distich
,
the
poet
and
satirist
.
"
<EOS>
Ben
Bullock
and
I
(
say
he
)
be
confident
against
the
world
in

<EOS>
do
you
never

his
ode
to
me

fair

We
be
swear
brother

admire

praise

quote
each
other

we
denounce
war
against
all
the

actor

have
draw
the
sword

throw
away

we
push

hack

hew

My

indeed

here
be
a
satire

which
I
write
in
an
alehouse
when
I
be
drunk
 
<EOS>
I
can
prove
it
by
the
evidence
of
the
landlord

his

I
fancy
you
will
own

I
have
some
right
to
say
with

<EOS>
the
knight
,
have
peruse
the
paper
,
declare
his
opinion
that
the
verse
be
tolerably
good
;
but
at
the
same
time
observe
that
the
author
have
revile
as
ignorant
dunce
several
person
who
have
writ
with
reputation
,
and
be
generally
allow
to
have
genius
:
a
circumstance
that
would
detract
more
from
his
candour
,
than
could
be
allow
to
his
capacity
.
   
<EOS>
"
damn
their
genius

(
cry
the
satyrist

a
pack
of
impertinent
rascal

tell
you

Sir

Ben

I
have
determine
to
crush
all

before

this
piece
be
write

be
you
drunk
too
when
it
be

publish

"
<EOS>
"
yes

the
printer
shall
make
affidavit
that
I
be

otherwise

drunk

maudlin

on
pretence
that

convey

infernal
mansion

They
seem
to
have
be
your
good
friend
,
(
say
the
knight
)
and
have
put
the
most
tender
interpretation
on
your
conduct
;
for
,
wave
the
plea
of
insanity
,
your
character
must
stand
as
that
of
a
man
who
hath
some
small
share
of
genius
,
without
an
atom
of
integrity
 
of
all
those
whom
Pope
lash
in
his
Dunciad
,
there
be
not
one
who
do
not
richly
deserve
the
imputation
of
dulness
;
and
every
one
of
them
have
provoke
the
satirist
by
a
personal
attack
.
   
<EOS>
in
this
respect
the
english
poet
be
much
more
honest
than
his
french
pattern
Boileau
,
who
stigmatize
several
man
of
acknowledge
genius
;
such
as
Quinault
,
Perrault
,
and
the
celebrated
Lulli
;
for
which
reason
every
man
of
a
liberal
turn
must
,
in
spite
of
all
his
poetical
merit
,
despise
him
as
a
rancorous
knave
.
<EOS>
if
this
disingenuous
conduct
can
not
be
forgive
in
a
writer
of
his
superior
genius
,
who
will
pardon
it
in
you
<EOS>
whose
name
be
not
half
emerge
from
obscurity
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Heark
ye
,
friend
,
(
reply
the
bard
)
keep
your
pardon
and
your
counsel
for
those
who
ask
it
;
or
,
if
you
will
force
them
upon
people
,
take
one
piece
of
advice
in
return
:
if
you
do
not
like
your
present
situation
,
apply
for
a
committee
without
delay
:
they
will
find
you
too
much
of
a
fool
to
have
the
least
tincture
of
madness
;
and
you
will
be
release
without
further
scruple
:
in
that
case
I
shall
rejoice
in
your
deliverance
;
you
will
be
free
from
confinement
,
and
I
shall
be
happily
deprive
of
your
conversation
.
"
   
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
fly
off
at
a
tangent
,
and
our
knight
could
not
help
smile
at
the
peculiar
virulence
of
his
disposition
.
   
<EOS>
Sir
Launcelot
then
endeavour
to
enter
into
conversation
with
his
attendant
,
by
ask
how
long
Mr
Distich
have
reside
in
the
house
;
but
he
may
as
well
have
address
himself
to
a
turkish
mute
:
the
fellow
either
pretend
ignorance
,
or
refuse
an
answer
to
every
question
that
be
propose
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
even
disclose
the
name
of
his
landlord
,
nor
inform
him
whereabout
the
house
be
situate
.
   
<EOS>
find
himself
agitate
with
impatience
and
indignation
,
he
return
to
his
apartment
,
and
the
door
be
lock
upon
him
,
begin
to
review
,
not
without
horror
,
the
particular
of
his
fate
.
   
<EOS>
"
how
little
reason
(
say
he
to
himself
)
<EOS>
have
we
to
boast
of
the
blessing
enjoy
by
the
british
subject
<EOS>
,
if
he
hold
them
on
such
a
precarious
tenure
:
if
a
man
of
rank
and
property
may
be
thus
kidnap
even
in
the
midst
of
the
capital
;
if
he
may
be
seize
by
ruffian
,
insult
,
rob
,
and
convey
to
such
a
prison
as
this
,
from
which
there
seem
to
be
no
possibility
of
escape
;
Should
I
be
indulge
with
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
and
appeal
to
my
relation
,
or
to
the
magistrate
of
my
country
,
my
letter
would
be
intercept
by
those
who
superintend
my
confinement
.
<EOS>
Should
I
try
to
alarm
the
neighbourhood
,
my
cry
would
be
neglect
as
those
of
some
unhappy
lunatic
under
necessary
correction
.
<EOS>
Should
I
employ
the
force
which
heaven
have
lend
me
,
I
may
imbrue
my
hand
in
blood
,
and
after
all
find
it
impossible
to
escape
through
a
number
of
successive
door
,
lock
,
bolt
,
and
centinel
.
<EOS>
Should
I
endeavour
to
tamper
with
the
servant
,
he
may
discover
my
design
,
and
then
I
should
be
abridge
of
the
little
comfort
I

People
may
inveigh
against
the
Bastile
in
France
,
and
the
inquisition
in
Portugal
;
but
I
would
ask
,
if
either
of
these
be
in
reality
so
dangerous
or
dreadful
as
a
private
mad
-
house
in
England
,
under
the
direction
of
a
ruffian
.
<EOS>
the
Bastile
be
a
state
prison
,
the
Inquisition
be
a
spiritual
tribunal
;
but
both
be
under
the
direction
of
government
.
   
<EOS>
It
seldom
,
if
ever
,
happen
that
a
man
intirely
innocent
be
confine
in
either
;
or
,
if
he
should
,
he
lay
his
account
with
a
legal
trial
before
establish
judge
.
<EOS>
but
in
England
,
the
most
innocent
person
upon
earth
be
liable
to
be
immure
for
life
under
the
pretext
of
lunacy
,
sequester
from
his
wife
,
child
,
and
friend
,
rob
of
his
fortune
,
deprive
even
of
necessary
,
and
subject
to
the
most
brutal
treatment
from
a
low
-
breed
barbarian
,
who
raise
an
ample
fortune
on
the
misery
of
his
fellow

may
,
during

,
practise
this
horrid
oppression
,
without

controul

"
   
<EOS>
this
uncomfortable
reverie
be
interrupt
by
a
very
unexpected
sound
that
seem
to
issue
from
the
other
side
of
a
thick
party
-
wall
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
strain
of
vocal
music
,
more
plaintive
than
the
widow'd
turtle
's
moan
,
more
sweet
and
ravish
than
Philomel

love
-
warble
song

<EOS>
through
his
ear
it
instantly
pierce
into
his

;
for
at
once
he
recognize
it
to
be
the
voice
of
his
adore
Aurelia

<EOS>
Heavens

<EOS>
what
be
the
agitation
of
his

when
he
make

<EOS>
how
do
every

quiver

<EOS>
how
do
his

throb
with
the
most
violent
emotion
!
<EOS>
He
run
round
the
room
in
distraction
,
foam
like
a
lion
in
the
toil
 
<EOS>
then
he
place
his
ear
close

<EOS>
when
the
sound
cease

vibrate
on

he
throw
himself
on

he
groan
with
anguish

he
exclaim
in
broken
accent

in
all
probability
his
heart
would
have
burst
<EOS>
,
have
not
the
violence
of
his
sorrow
find
vent
in

His
surprize
at
find
his

Aurelia
in
such
a

the

her

and
his
unspeakable
eagerness
to
contrive
some

by

a
thousand
extravagancy

which
it
be
well
for
him

<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
well
for
the
servant
that
he
do
not

paroxysm

have
this

<EOS>
"
Sir
,
the
practice
of
medicine
be
one
of
the
most
honourable
profession
exercise
among
the
son
of
man
;
a
profession
which
hath

all
period

in

and
even
hold
sacred
in
the
most
polished
age
of

<EOS>
the
scope
of
it
be
to
preserve
the
being

and
confirm
the
health
of
our
fellow

creature
;
of
consequence
,
to
sustain
the
blessing
of
society
,
and
crown
life
with
fruition

<EOS>
the
character
of
a
physician
,
therefore
,
not
only
suppose
natural
sagacity
,
and
acquire
erudition
,
but
it
also
imply
every
delicacy
of
sentiment

every
tenderness
of
nature
,
and
every
virtue
of
humanity
.
<EOS>
that
these
quality
be
center
in
you
,
doctor
,
I
would
willingly
believe
:
but
it
will
be
sufficient
for
my
purpose
,
that
you
be
possess
of
common
integrity

<EOS>
to
whose
concern
I
be
indebted
for
your
visit

you
best
know

<EOS>
but
if
you
understand
the
art
of
medicine

you
must
be
sensible
by
this

that
with
respect
to
me
your

altogether
unnecessary
  
come

Sir

you
can
not
 
you
do
not
believe
that
my
intellect

<EOS>
yet
,
grant
me
to
be
really
under
the
influence
of
that
deplorable
malady
,
no
person
have
a
right
to
treat
me
as

my

<EOS>
that
you
may
not

the

<EOS>
that
gentleman
,
I
be
sure
,
have
no
concern
in
seduce
me
by
false
pretence
under
the
cloud
of
night
into
the
field
,
where
I

honest

of

Your

resume

assure
our

the

double

He

<EOS>
the

find
him
incorrigible
,
leave
him
to
the
slend
chance
of
be
one
day
comfort
by
the
dram

bottle
;
but
resolve
,
if
possible
,
to
set
on
foot
an
accurate
inquiry
into
the
oeconomy

transaction
of
this
private
inquisition

ample
justice

interchanged

produce

the
joy
that
now
diffuse
itself
in
the
heart

be
more
easily
conceive
than
describe
;
but
,
in
order
to
give
a
stability
to
this
mutual
satisfaction

it
be
necessary
that
Aurelia
should
be
secure
from
the
tyranny

guardianship
would
not
otherwise
for
some

CHAPTER
XXV
<EOS>
which
,
it
be
to
be
hope
,
will
be
,
on
more
account
than
one
,
agreeable
to
the
reader
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Launcelot
have
vindicate
the
liberty
,
confirm
the
safety
,
and
secure
the
heart
of
his
charming
Aurelia
,
now
find
leisure
to
unravel
the
conspiracy
which
have
be
execute
against
his
person
;
and
with
that
view
commence
a
law
-
suit
against
the
owner
of
the
house
where
he
and
his
mistress
have
be
separately
confine
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Shackle
be
,
notwithstanding
all
the
submission
and
atonement
which
he
offer
to
make
,
either
in
private
or
in
public
,
indict
on
the
statute
of
kidnapping
,
try
,
convict
,
punish
by
a
severe
fine
,
and
stand
in
the
pillory
.
<EOS>
a
judicial
writ
ad
inquirendum
be
execute
,
the
prison
of
his
inquisition
be
lay
open
,
and
several
innocent
captive
enlarge
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
Shackle
's
trial
,
it
appear
that
the
knight
's
confinement
be
a
scheme
execute
by
his
rival
Mr
Sycamore
,
accord
to
the
device
of
his
counsellor
Dawdle
,
who
,
by
this
contrivance
,
have
reconcile
himself
to
his
patron
,
after
have
desert
him
in
the
day
of
battle
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
be
so
incensed
at
the
discovery
of
Sycamore
's
treachery
and
ingratitude
,
that
he
go
in
quest
of
him
immediately
,
to
take
vengeance
on
his
person
,
accompany
by
captain
Crowe
,
who
want
to
ballance
account
with
Mr
Dawdle
.
<EOS>
but
those
gentleman
have
wisely
avoid
the
impending
storm
,
by
retire
to
the
continent
,
on
pretence
of
travel
for
improvement
.
   
<EOS>
Sir
Launcelot
be
not
now
so
much
of
a
knight
-
errant
,
as
to
leave
Aurelia
to
the
care
of
Providence
,
and
pursue
the
traitor
to
the
farth
extremity
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
He
practice
a
much
more
easy
,
certain
,
and
effectual
method
of
revenge
,
by
institute
a
process
against
them
,
which
,
after
writ
of
capias
,
alias
,
&
plurie
,
have
be
repeat
,
subject
them
both
to
outlawry
.
<EOS>
Mr
Sycamore
and
his
friend
be
thus
deprive
of
the
benefit
of
the
law
,
by
their
own
neglect
,
would
likewise
have
forfeit
their
good
and
chattel
to
the
king
,
have
not
they
make
such
submission
as
appease
the
wrath
of
Sir
Launcelot
and
captain
Crowe
;
then
they
venture
to
return
,
and
by
dint
of
interest
obtain
a
reversal
of
the
outlawry
.
<EOS>
but
this
grace
they
do
not
enjoy
,
till
long
after
our
adventurer
be
happily
establish
in
life
.
   
<EOS>
while
the
knight
wait
impatiently
for
the
expiration
of
Aurelia
's
minority
,
and
,
in
the
mean
time
,
console
himself
with
the
imperfect
happiness
arise
from
her
conversation
,
and
those
indulgence
which
the
most
unblemished
virtue
could
bestow
;
captain
Crowe
project
another
plan
of
vengeance
against
the
conjurer
,
whose
lie
oracle
have
cost
him
such
a
world
of
vexation
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
the
captain
begin
to
be
tired
of
idleness
,
and
undertake
this
adventure
to
keep
his
hand
in
use
.
<EOS>
He
impart
his
design
to
Crabshaw
,
who
have
likewise
suffer
in
spirit
from
the
prediction
of
the
say
offender
,
and
be
extremely
well
disposed
to
assist
in
punish
the
false
prophet
.
<EOS>
He
now
take
it
for
grant
that
he
should
not
be
hang
for
steal
a
horse
;
and
think
it
very
hard
to
pay
so
much
money
for
a
deceitful
prophecy
,
which
,
in
all
likelihood
,
would
never
be
fulfil
.
   
<EOS>
actuate
by
these
motive
,
they
set
out
together
for
the
house
of
consultation
;
but
they
find
it
shut
up
and
abandon
,
and
,
upon
inquiry
in
the
neighbourhood
,
learn
that
the
conjurer
have
move
his
quarter
that
very
day
on
which
the
captain
have
recourse
to
his
art
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
actually
the
case
:
he
know
the
fate
of
Sir
Launcelot
would
soon
come
to
light
,
and
he
do
not
chuse
to
wait
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
He
have
other
motive
for
decamp
.
<EOS>
He
have
run
a
score
at
the
public
-
house
,
which
he
have
no
mind
to
discharge
,
and
want
to
disengage
himself
from
his
female
associate
,
who
know
too
much
of
his
affair
,
to
be
keep
at
a
proper
distance
.
<EOS>
all
these
purpose
he
have
answer
,
by
retreat
softly
,
without
beat
of
drum
,
while
his
Sybil
be
abroad
run
down
prey
for
his
devouring
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
,
however
,
take
his
measure
so
cunningly
,
but
that
this
old
hag
discover
his
new
lodging
,
and
,
in
revenge
,
give
information
to
the
publican
.
<EOS>
this
creditor
take
out
a
writ
accordingly
;
and
the
bailiff
have
just
secure
his
person
as
Capt
Crowe
and
Timothy
Crabshaw
chance
to
pass
by
the
door
in
their
way
homeward
,
through
an
obscure
street
near
the
Seven
Dials
.
   
<EOS>
the
conjurer
have
no
subterfuge
leave
,
but
a
great
many
particular
reason
for
avoid
an
explanation
with
the
justice
,
like
the
man
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
sea
,
of
two
evil
choose
the
least
;
and
beckon
to
the
captain
,
call
him
by
his
name
.
<EOS>
Crowe
,
thus
address
,
reply
with
a
"
Hilloah
!
"
<EOS>
and
look
towards
the
place
from
whence
he
be
hail
,
at
once
recognize
the
negromancer
.
<EOS>
without
farth
hesitation
he
spring
across
the
street
,
and
collar
Albumazar
,
exclaim
,
"
aha
!
<EOS>
old
boy
;
be
the
wind
in
that
corner
?
  
<EOS>
I
think
we
should
grapple
one
day
 
now
will
I
bring
you
up
by
the
head
,
tho
'
<EOS>
all
the
devil
in
hell
be
blow
abast
the
beam
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
bailiff
see
his
prisoner
so
roughly
handle
before
,
and
at
the
same
time
assault
behind
by
Crabshaw
,
who
cry
,
"
shew
me
a
liar
,
and
I
will
shew
you
a
thief
 
who
be
to
be
hang
now
?
"
     
<EOS>
I
say
,
the
bailiff
,
fear
he
should
lose
the
benefit
of
his
job
,
begin
to
put
on
his
contentious
face
,
and
,
declare
the
doctor
be
his
prisoner
,
swear
he
could
not
surrender
him
without
a
warrant
from
the
lord
chief
justice
.
<EOS>
the
whole
groupe
adjourning
into
the
parlour
,
the
conjurer
desire
to
know
of
Crowe
,
whether
Sir
Launcelot
be
find
?
<EOS>
be
answer
,
"
ey
,
ey
,
safe
enough
to
see
you
make
fast
in
the
bilbo
,
brother
;
"
he
tell
the
captain
he
have
something
of
consequence
to
communicate
for
his
advantage
;
and
propose
that
Crowe
and
Crabshaw
should
bail
the
action
,
which
lie
only
for
a
debt
of
three
pound
.
   
<EOS>
Crowe
storm
,
and
Crabshaw
grin
at
this
modest
proposal
:
but
when
they
understand
that
they
could
only
be
bind
for
his
appearance
,
and
reflect
that
they
need
not
part
with
him
until
his
body
should
be
surrender
unto
justice
,
they
consent
to
give
bail
;
and
the
bond
be
execute
,
convey
him
directly
to
the
house
of
our
adventurer
.
<EOS>
the
boisterous
Crowe
introduce
him
to
Sir
Launcelot
with
such
an
abrupt
unconnected
detail
of
his
offence
,
as
the
knight
could
not
understand
without
Timothy
's
annotation
.
   
<EOS>
these
be
follow
by
some
question
put
to
the
conjurer
,
who
lay
aside
his
black
gown
,
and
pluck
off
his
white
beard
,
exhibit
to
the
astonished
spectator
the
very
individual
countenance
of
the
empyrical
politician
Ferret
,
who
have
play
our
hero
such
a
slippery
trick
after
the
electioneore
adventure
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
perceive
(
say
he
)
<EOS>
you
be
prepare
to
expostulate
,
and
upbraid
me
for
have
give
a
false
information
against
you
to
the
country
justice
.
<EOS>
I
look
upon
mankind
to
be
in
a
state
of
nature
,
a
truth
which
Hobbes
hath
stumble
upon
by
accident
:
I
think
every
man
have
a
right
to
avail
himself
of
his
talent
,
even
at
the
expence
of
his
fellow

creature

just
as
we
see
the
fish
,
and
other
animal
of
the
creation
devour
one
another
.
     
<EOS>
I
find
the
justice
but
one
degree
remove
from
ideotism
,
and
know
that
he
would
commit
some
blunder
in
the
execution
of
his
office

which
would
lay
him
at
your
mercy

I
contrive
to
make
his
folly
the
instrument
of
my
escape
 
<EOS>
I
be
dismiss
without
be
oblige
to
sign
the
information
I
have
give
;
and
you
take
ample
vengeance
for
his
tyranny
and
impertinence
.
<EOS>
I
come
to
London
,
where
my
circumstance
oblige
me
to
live
in
disguise
.
<EOS>
in
the
character
of
a
conjurer
,
I
be
consult
by
your
follower
Crowe
,
and
your

squire
Crabshaw

<EOS>
I
do
little
or
nothing
<EOS>
but
eccho
back
the
intelligence
they
bring
me
,
except
prognosticate
that
Crabshaw
would
be
hang
;
a
prediction
to
which
I
find
myself
so
irresistibly
impel
,
that
I
be
persuade
it
be
the
real
effect
of
inspiration

I

arrest
for
a
paultry
sum
of
money

and
,
moreover
,
liable
to
be
send
to
Bridewell
as
an
impostor
 
<EOS>
let
those
answer
for
my
conduct
whose
cruelty
and
insolence
have
drive
me
to
the
necessity
of
use
such
subterfuge
  
I
have

your

<EOS>
that
which
be
acknowledge

construe
falshood
in

and
great
reason
we

I

I

I

Mr
Clarke
,
who
be
present
,
begin
to
stare
;
while
the
knight
assure
Ferret
,
that
if
he
be
really
able
and
willing
to
serve
captain
Crowe
in
any
thing
essential
,
he
should
be
amply
reward

<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
he
discharge
the
debt
,
and
assign
him
an
apartment
in
his

house

<EOS>
that
same
day
Crowe
,
by
the
advice
of
Sir
Launcelot
and
his
nephew
,
enter
into
conditional
article
with
the
Cynic
,
to
allow
him
the
interest
of
fifteen
hundred
pound
for
life

provide

the

obtain
possession

hole
in
Yorkshire

which
have
belong

and
of
which
he
be
heir
of
blood

<EOS>
this
bond

Mr
Ferret
discover
that
he
himself
be
the
lawful
husband
of
Bridget
Maple
,
aunt
to
Samuel
Crowe
,
by
a
clandestine
marriage
;
which
,
however
,
he
convince
them
he
could
prove
by
undeniable
evidence
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
case
,
she
,
the
say
Bridget
Maple
,
alias
Ferret
,
be
a
covert
femme
,
consequently
could
not
transact
any
deed
of
alienation
without
his
concurrence
;
ergo
,
the
docking
of
the
intail
of
the
estate
of
Hobby
-
hole
be
illegal
and
of
none
effect
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
a
very
agreeable
declaration
to
the
whole
company
,
who
do
not
fail
to
congratulate
captain
Crowe
on
the
prospect
of

<EOS>
Tom
Clarke
,
in
particular
,
protest
,
with
tear
in
his
eye
,
that
it
give
him
unspeakable
joy
;
and
his
tear
trickle
the
faster
,
when
Crowe
with
an
arch
look
signify
,
that
now
he
be
pretty
well
victual
for
life
,
he
have
some
thought
of
embark
on
the
voyage
of
matrimony
.
   
<EOS>
but
that
point
of
happiness
to
which
,
as
the
north
pole
,
the
course
of
these
adventure
hath
be
invariably
direct

the
indissoluble
union
of
the
accomplished
Sir
Launcelot
Greaves

the
enchanting
Miss
Darnel

<EOS>
Our
hero
now
discover
in
his
mistress
a
thousand
charm
,
which
hitherto
he
have
no
opportunity
to
contemplate
.
<EOS>
He
find
her
beauty
excel
by
her
good
sense
,
and
her
virtue
superior
to
both

<EOS>
He
find
her
untainted
by
that
giddiness

vanity
,
and
affectation

which
distinguish
the
fashionable
female
of
the
present

the
rage
for
diversion
and
dissipation
;
for
noise

glitter

and
extravagance

<EOS>
He
find
her
not
only
raise
by
understanding
and
taste
far
above
the
amusement
of
little
vulgar
mind
;
but
even
exalt
by
uncommon
genius
and
refined
reflection
,
so
as
to
relish
the
more
sublime
enjoyment
of
rational
pleasure
.
<EOS>
He
find
her
possess
of
that
vigour
of
mind
which
constitute
true
fortitude
,
and
vindicate
the
empire
of
reason
.
<EOS>
He
find
her
heart
incapable
of
disguise
or
dissimulation
;
frank
,
generous
,
and
open
;
susceptible
of
the
most
tender
impression
;

with
a
keen
sense
of
honour
,
and
melt
with
humanity
