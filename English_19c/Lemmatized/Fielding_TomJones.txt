BOOK
<EOS>
I.
  
<EOS>
contain
as
much
of
the
birth
of
the
FOUNDLING
as
<EOS>
be
NECESSARY
or
PROPER
to
acquaint
the
READER
with
in
the
beginning
of
this
history
.
   
<EOS>
the
introduction
to
the
work
,
or
bill
of
fare
to
the
feast
.
 
<EOS>
an
author
ought
to
consider
himself
,
not
as
a
gentleman
who
give
a
private
or
eleemosynary
treat
,
but
rather
as
one
who
keep
a
public
ordinary
,
at
which
all
person
be
welcome
for
their
money
.
<EOS>
in
the
former
case
,
it
be
well
known
that
the
entertainer
provide
what
fare
he
please
;
and
though
this
should
be
very
indifferent
,
and
utterly
disagreeable
to
the
taste
of
his
company
,
they
must
not
find
any
fault
;
nay
,
on
the
contrary
,
good
breeding
force
them
outwardly
to
approve
and
to
commend
whatever
be
set
before
them
.
<EOS>
now
the
contrary
of
this
happen
to
the
master
of
an
ordinary
.
<EOS>
man
who
pay
for
what
they
eat
will
insist
on
gratify
their
palate
,
however
nice
and
whimsical
these
may
prove
;
and
if
everything
be
not
agreeable
to
their
taste
,
will
challenge
a
right
to
censure
,
to
abuse
,
and
to
d####n
their
dinner
without
controul
.
  
<EOS>
to
prevent
,
therefore
,
give
offence
to
their
customer
by
any
such
disappointment
,
it
hath
be
usual
with
the
honest
and
well
-
mean
host
to
provide
a
bill
of
fare
which
all
person
may
peruse
at
their
first
entrance
into
the
house
;
and
have
thence
acquaint
themselves
with
the
entertainment
which
they
may
expect
,
may
either
stay
and
regale
with
what
be
provide
for
them
,
or
may
depart
to
some
other
ordinary
better
accommodate
to
their
taste
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
do
not
disdain
to
borrow
wit
or
wisdom
from
any
man
who
be
capable
of
lend
us
either
,
we
have
condescend
to
take
a
hint
from
these
honest
victualler
,
and
shall
prefix
not
only
a
general
bill
of
fare
to
our
whole
entertainment
,
but
shall
likewise
give
the
reader
particular
bill
to
every
course
which
be
to
be
serve
up
in
this
and
the
ensue
volume
.
  
<EOS>
the
provision
,
then
,
which
we
have
here
make
be
no
other
than
Human
Nature
.
<EOS>
nor
do
I
fear
that
my
sensible
reader
,
though
most
luxurious
in
his
taste
,
will
start
,
cavil
,
or
be
offend
,
because
I
have
name
but
one
article
.
<EOS>
the
tortoise
 
as
the
alderman
of
Bristol
,
well
learn
in
eating
,
know
by
much
experience
 
besides
the
delicious
calipash
and
calipee
,
contain
many
different
kind
of
food
;
nor
can
the
learn
reader
be
ignorant
,
that
in
human
nature
,
though
here
collect
under
one
general
name
,
be
such
prodigious
variety
,
that
a
cook
will
have
sooner
go
through
all
the
several
specie
of
animal
and
vegetable
food
in
the
world
,
than
an
author
will
be
able
to
exhaust
so
extensive
a
subject
.
  
<EOS>
an
objection
may
perhaps
be
apprehend
from
the
more
delicate
,
that
this
dish
be
too
common
and
vulgar
;
for
what
else
be
the
subject
of
all
the
romance
,
novel
,
play
,
and
poem
,
with
which
the
stall
abound
?
<EOS>
many
exquisite
viand
may
be
reject
by
the
epicure
,
if
it
be
a
sufficient
cause
for
his
contemning
of
them
as
common
and
vulgar
,
that
something
be
to
be
find
in
the
most
paltry
alley
under
the
same
name
.
<EOS>
in
reality
,
true
nature
be
as
difficult
to
be
meet
with
in
author
,
as
the
Bayonne
ham
,
or
Bologna
sausage
,
be
to
be
find
in
the
shop
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
whole
,
to
continue
the
same
metaphor
,
consist
in
the
cookery
of
the
author
;
for
,
as
Mr
Pope
tell
us
       
"
true
wit
be
nature
to
advantage
dr
;
    
what
oft
be
think
,
but
ne'er
so
well
expr
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
same
animal
which
hath
the
honour
to
have
some
part
of
his
flesh
eat
at
the
table
of
a
duke
,
may
perhaps
be
degrade
in
another
part
,
and
some
of
his
limb
gibbet
,
as
it
be
,
in
the
vile
stall
in
town
.
<EOS>
where
,
then
,
lie
the
difference
between
the
food
of
the
nobleman
and
the
porter
,
if
both
be
at
dinner
on
the
same
ox
or
calf
,
but
in
the
seasoning
,
the
dressing
,
the
garnishing
,
and
the
setting
forth
?
<EOS>
hence
the
one
provoke
and
incite
the
most
languid
appetite
,
and
the
other
turn
and
pall
that
which
be
the
sharp
and
keen
.
  
<EOS>
in
like
manner
,
the
excellence
of
the
mental
entertainment
consist
less
in
the
subject
than
in
the
author
's
skill
in
well
dress
it
up
.
<EOS>
how
pleased
,
therefore
,
will
the
reader
be
to
find
that
we
have
,
in
the
follow
work
,
adhere
closely
to
one
of
the
high
principle
of
the
good
cook
which
the
present
age
,
or
perhaps
that
of
Heliogabalus
,
hath
produce
.
<EOS>
this
great
man
,
as
be
well
known
to
all
lover
of
polite
eating
,
begin
at
first
by
set
plain
thing
before
his
hungry
guest
,
rise
afterwards
by
degree
as
their
stomach
may
be
suppose
to
decrease
,
to
the
very
quintessence
of
sauce
and
spice
.
<EOS>
in
like
manner
,
we
shall
represent
human
nature
at
first
to
the
keen
appetite
of
our
reader
,
in
that
more
plain
and
simple
manner
in
which
it
be
find
in
the
country
,
and
shall
hereafter
hash
and
ragoo
it
with
all
the
high
french
and
italian
seasoning
of
affectation
and
vice
which
court
and
city
afford
.
<EOS>
by
these
mean
,
we
doubt
not
but
our
reader
may
be
render
desirous
to
read
on
for
ever
,
as
the
great
person
just
above
-
mention
be
suppose
to
have
make
some
person
eat
.
  
<EOS>
have
premise
thus
much
,
we
will
now
detain
those
who
like
our
bill
of
fare
no
longer
from
their
diet
,
and
shall
proceed
directly
to
serve
up
the
first
course
of
our
history
for
their
entertainment
.
    
<EOS>
a
short
description
of
squire
Allworthy
,
and
a
full
account
of
Miss
Bridget
Allworthy
,
his
sister
.
 
<EOS>
in
that
part
of
the
western
division
of
this
kingdom
which
be
commonly
call
Somersetshire
,
there
lately
live
,
and
perhaps
live
still
,
a
gentleman
whose
name
be
Allworthy
,
and
who
may
well
be
call
the
favourite
of
both
nature
and
fortune
;
for
both
of
these
seem
to
have
contend
which
should
bless
and
enrich
him
most
.
<EOS>
in
this
contention
,
nature
may
seem
to
some
to
have
come
off
victorious
,
as
she
bestow
on
him
many
gift
,
while
fortune
have
only
one
gift
in
her
power
;
but
in
pour
forth
this
,
she
be
so
very
profuse
,
that
other
perhaps
may
think
this
single
endowment
to
have
be
more
than
equivalent
to
all
the
various
blessing
which
he
enjoy
from
nature
.
<EOS>
from
the
former
of
these
,
he
derive
an
agreeable
person
,
a
sound
constitution
,
a
solid
understanding
,
and
a
benevolent
heart
;
by
the
latter
,
he
be
decree
to
the
inheritance
of
one
of
the
large
estate
in
the
county
.
  
<EOS>
this
gentleman
have
in
his
youth
marry
a
very
worthy
and
beautiful
woman
,
of
whom
he
have
be
extremely
fond
:
by
her
he
have
three
child
,
all
of
whom
die
in
their
infancy
.
<EOS>
He
have
likewise
have
the
misfortune
of
bury
this
beloved
wife
herself
,
about
five
year
before
the
time
in
which
this
history
chuse
to
set
out
.
<EOS>
this
loss
,
however
great
,
he
bear
like
a
man
of
sense
and
constancy
,
though
it
must
be
confest
<EOS>
he
would
often
talk
a
little
whimsically
on
this
head
;
for
he
sometimes
say
he
look
on
himself
as
still
married
,
and
consider
his
wife
as
only
go
a
little
before
him
,
a
journey
which
he
should
most
certainly
,
sooner
or
later
,
take
after
her
;
and
that
he
have
not
the
least
doubt
of
meet
her
again
in
a
place
where
he
should
never
part
with
her
more
 
sentiment
for
which
his
sense
be
arraign
by
one
part
of
his
neighbour
,
his
religion
by
a
second
,
and
his
sincerity
by
a
third
.
  
<EOS>
He
now
live
,
for
the
most
part
,
retire
in
the
country
,
with
one
sister
,
for
whom
he
have
a
very
tender
affection
.
<EOS>
this
lady
be
now
somewhat
past
the
age
of
thirty
,
an
aera
at
which
,
in
the
opinion
of
the
malicious
,
the
title
of
old
maid
may
with
no
impropriety
be
assume
.
<EOS>
She
be
of
that
specie
of
woman
whom
you
commend
rather
for
good
quality
than
beauty
,
and
who
be
generally
call
,
by
their
own
sex
,
very
good
sort
of
woman
 
<EOS>
as
good
a
sort
of
woman
,
madam
,
as
you
would
wish
to
know
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
be
so
far
from
regret
want
of
beauty
,
that
she
never
mention
that
perfection
,
if
it
can
be
call
one
,
without
contempt
;
and
would
often
thank
God
she
be
not
as
handsome
as
Miss
Such
-
a
-
one
,
whom
perhaps
beauty
have
lead
into
error
which
she
may
have
otherwise
avoid
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bridget
Allworthy
(
for
that
be
the
name
of
this
lady
)
very
rightly
conceive
the
charm
of
person
in
a
woman
to
be
no
well
than
snare
for
herself
,
as
well
as
for
other
;
and
yet
so
discreet
be
she
in
her
conduct
,
that
her
prudence
be
as
much
on
the
guard
as
if
she
have
all
the
snare
to
apprehend
which
be
ever
lay
for
her
whole
sex
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
have
observe
,
though
it
may
seem
unaccountable
to
the
reader
,
that
this
guard
of
prudence
,
like
the
train
band
,
be
always
readiest
to
go
on
duty
where
there
be
the
least
danger
.
<EOS>
It
often
basely
and
cowardly
desert
those
paragon
for
whom
the
man
be
all
wish
,
sigh
,
die
,
and
spread
,
every
net
in
their
power
;
and
constantly
attend
at
the
heel
of
that
high
order
of
woman
for
whom
the
other
sex
have
a
more
distant
and
awful
respect
,
and
whom
(
from
despair
,
I
suppose
,
of
success
)
they
never
venture
to
attack
.
  
<EOS>
reader
,
I
think
proper
,
before
we
proceed
any
farther
together
,
to
acquaint
thee
that
I
intend
to
digress
,
through
this
whole
history
,
as
often
as
I
see
occasion
,
of
which
I
be
myself
a
well
judge
than
any
pitiful
critic
whatever
;
and
here
I
must
desire
all
those
critic
to
mind
their
own
business
,
and
not
to
intermeddle
with
affair
or
work
which
no
way
concern
them
;
for
till
they
produce
the
authority
by
which
they
be
constitute
judge
,
I
shall
not
plead
to
their
jurisdiction
.
    
<EOS>
an
odd
accident
which
befel
Mr
Allworthy
at
his
return
home
.
<EOS>
the
decent
behaviour
of
Mrs
Deborah
Wilkins
,
with
some
proper
animadversion
on
bastard
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
tell
my
reader
,
in
the
precede
chapter
,
that
Mr
Allworthy
inherit
a
large
fortune
;
that
he
have
a
good
heart
,
and
no
family
.
<EOS>
hence
,
doubtless
,
it
will
be
conclude
by
many
that
he
live
like
an
honest
man
,
owe
no
one
a
shilling
,
take
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
be
his
own
,
keep
a
good
house
,
entertain
his
neighbour
with
a
hearty
welcome
at
his
table
,
and
be
charitable
to
the
poor
,
i.e.
to
those
who
have
rather
beg
than
work
,
by
give
them
the
offal
from
it
;
that
he
die
immensely
rich
and
build
an
hospital
.
  
<EOS>
and
true
it
be
that
he
do
many
of
these
thing
;
but
have
he
do
nothing
more
I
should
have
leave
him
to
have
record
his
own
merit
on
some
fair
freestone
over
the
door
of
that
hospital
.
<EOS>
matter
of
a
much
more
extraordinary
kind
be
to
be
the
subject
of
this
history
,
or
I
should
grossly
mis
-
spend
my
time
in
write
so
voluminous
a
work
;
and
you
,
my
sagacious
friend
,
may
with
equal
profit
and
pleasure
travel
through
some
page
which
certain
droll
author
have
be
facetiously
pleased
to
call
the
history
of
England
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
have
be
absent
a
full
quarter
of
a
year
in
London
,
on
some
very
particular
business
,
though
I
know
not
what
it
be
;
but
judge
of
its
importance
by
its
have
detain
him
so
long
from
home
,
whence
<EOS>
he
have
not
be
absent
a
month
at
a
time
during
the
space
of
many
year
.
<EOS>
He
come
to
his
house
very
late
in
the
evening
,
and
after
a
short
supper
with
his
sister
,
retire
much
fatigue
to
his
chamber
.
<EOS>
here
,
have
spend
some
minute
on
his
knee
 
a
custom
which
he
never
break
through
on
any
account
 
he
be
prepare
to
step
into
bed
,
when
,
upon
open
the
cloathe
,
to
his
great
surprize
he
behold
an
infant
,
wrapt
up
in
some
coarse
linen
,
in
a
sweet
and
profound
sleep
,
between
his
sheet
.
<EOS>
He
stand
some
time
lose
in
astonishment
at
this
sight
;
but
,
as
good
nature
have
always
the
ascendant
in
his
mind
,
he
soon
begin
to
be
touch
with
sentiment
of
compassion
for
the
little
wretch
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
then
ring
his
bell
,
and
order
an
elderly
woman
-
servant
to
rise
immediately
,
and
come
to
him
;
and
in
the
meantime
be
so
eager
in
contemplate
the
beauty
of
innocence
,
appear
in
those
lively
colour
with
which
infancy
and
sleep
always
display
it
,
that
his
thought
be
too
much
engage
to
reflect
that
he
be
in
his
shirt
when
the
matron
come
in
.
<EOS>
She
have
indeed
give
her
master
sufficient
time
to
dress
himself
;
for
out
of
respect
to
him
,
and
regard
to
decency
,
she
have
spend
many
minute
in
adjust
her
hair
at
the
looking
-
glass
,
notwithstanding
all
the
hurry
in
which
she
have
be
summon
by
the
servant
,
and
though
her
master
,
for
aught
she
know
,
lie
expire
in
an
apoplexy
,
or
in
some
other
fit
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
not
be
wonder
at
that
a
creature
who
have
so
strict
a
regard
to
decency
in
her
own
person
,
should
be
shock
at
the
least
deviation
from
it
in
another
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
no
sooner
open
the
door
,
and
see
her
master
stand
by
the
bedside
in
his
shirt
,
with
a
candle
in
his
hand
,
than
she
start
back
in
a
most
terrible
fright
,
and
may
perhaps
have
swoon
away
,
have
he
not
now
recollect
his
be
undrest
,
and
put
an
end
to
her
terror
by
desire
her
to
stay
without
the
door
till
he
have
throw
some
cloathe
over
his
back
,
and
be
become
incapable
of
shock
the
pure
eye
of
Mrs
Deborah
Wilkins
,
who
,
though
in
the
fifty
-
second
year
of
her
age
,
vow
she
have
never
beheld
a
man
without
his
coat
.
<EOS>
sneerer
and
prophane
wit
may
perhaps
laugh
at
her
first
fright
;
yet
my
graver
reader
,
when
he
consider
the
time
of
night
,
the
summon
from
her
bed
,
and
the
situation
in
which
she
find
her
master
,
will
highly
justify
and
applaud
her
conduct
,
unless
the
prudence
which
must
be
suppose
to
attend
maiden
at
that
period
of
life
at
which
Mrs
Deborah
have
arrive
,
should
a
little
lessen
his
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mrs
Deborah
return
into
the
room
,
and
be
acquaint
by
her
master
with
the
finding
the
little
infant
,
her
consternation
be
rather
great
than
his
have
be
;
nor
could
she
refrain
from
cry
out
,
with
great
horror
of
accent
as
well
as
look
,
"
My
good
sir
!
<EOS>
what
be
to
be
do
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
answer
,
she
must
take
care
of
the
child
that
evening
,
and
in
the
morning
he
would
give
order
to
provide
it
a
nurse
.
"
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
,
"
say
she
;
"
and
I
hope
your
worship
will
send
out
your
warrant
to
take
up
the
hussy
its
mother
,
for
she
must
be
one
of
the
neighbourhood
;
and
I
should
be
glad
to
see
her
commit
to
Bridewell
,
and
whipt
at
the
cart
's
tail
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
such
wicked
slut
can
not
be
too
severely
punish
.
<EOS>
I
will
warrant
'
tis
not
her
first
,
by
her
impudence
in
lay
it
to
your
worship
.
"
<EOS>
"
in
lay
it
to
me
,
Deborah
!
"
answer
Allworthy
:
"
I
can
not
think
she
hath
any
such
design
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
hath
only
take
this
method
to
provide
for
her
child
;
and
truly
I
be
glad
she
hath
not
do
bad
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
be
bad
,
"
cry
Deborah
,
"
than
for
such
wicked
strumpet
to
lay
their
sin
at
honest
man
's
door
;
and
though
your
worship
know
your
own
innocence
,
yet
the
world
be
censorious
;
and
it
hath
be
many
an
honest
man
be
hap
to
pass
for
the
father
of
child
he
never
beget
;
and
if
your
worship
should
provide
for
the
child
,
it
may
make
the
people
the
apter
to
believe
;
besides
,
why
should
your
worship
provide
for
what
the
parish
be
oblige
to
maintain
?
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
if
it
be
an
honest
man
's
child
,
indeed
 
but
for
my
own
part
,
it
go
against
me
to
touch
these
misbegotten
wretch
,
whom
I
do
not
look
upon
as
my
fellow
-
creature
.
<EOS>
faugh
!
<EOS>
how
it
stink
!
<EOS>
It
doth
not
smell
like
a
Christian
.
<EOS>
if
I
may
be
so
bold
to
give
my
advice
,
I
would
have
it
put
in
a
basket
,
and
send
out
and
lay
at
the
churchwarden
's
door
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
good
night
,
only
a
little
rainy
and
windy
;
and
if
it
be
well
wrapt
up
,
and
put
in
a
warm
basket
,
it
be
two
to
one
<EOS>
but
it
live
till
it
be
find
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
but
if
it
should
not
,
we
have
discharge
our
duty
in
take
proper
care
of
it
;
and
it
be
,
perhaps
,
well
for
such
creature
to
die
in
a
state
of
innocence
,
than
to
grow
up
and
imitate
their
mother
;
for
nothing
well
can
be
expect
of
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
some
stroke
in
this
speech
which
perhaps
would
have
offend
Mr
Allworthy
,
have
he
strictly
attend
to
it
;
but
he
have
now
get
one
of
his
finger
into
the
infant
's
hand
,
which
,
by
its
gentle
pressure
,
seem
to
implore
his
assistance
,
have
certainly
out
-
plead
the
eloquence
of
Mrs
Deborah
,
have
it
be
ten
time
great
than
it
be
.
<EOS>
He
now
give
Mrs
Deborah
positive
order
to
take
the
child
to
her
own
bed
,
and
to
call
up
a
maid
-
servant
to
provide
it
pap
,
and
other
thing
,
against
it
wake
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
order
that
proper
cloathe
should
be
procure
for
it
early
in
the
morning
,
and
that
it
should
be
bring
to
himself
as
soon
as
he
be
stir
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
discernment
of
Mrs
Wilkins
,
and
such
the
respect
she
bear
her
master
,
under
whom
she
enjoy
a
most
excellent
place
,
that
her
scruple
give
way
to
his
peremptory
command
;
and
she
take
the
child
under
her
arm
,
without
any
apparent
disgust
at
the
illegality
of
its
birth
;
and
declare
it
be
a
sweet
little
infant
,
walk
off
with
it
to
her
own
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
here
betook
himself
to
those
pleasing
slumber
which
a
heart
that
hunger
after
goodness
be
apt
to
enjoy
when
thoroughly
satisfied
.
<EOS>
as
these
be
possibly
sweet
than
what
be
occasion
by
any
other
hearty
meal
,
I
should
take
more
pain
to
display
them
to
the
reader
,
if
I
know
any
air
to
recommend
him
to
for
the
procuring
such
an
appetite
.
    
<EOS>
the
reader
's
neck
bring
into
danger
by
a
description
;
his
escape
;
and
the
great
condescension
of
Miss
Bridget
Allworthy
.
 
<EOS>
the
gothic
stile
of
building
could
produce
nothing
noble
than
Mr
Allworthy
's
house
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
air
of
grandeur
in
it
that
strike
you
with
awe
,
and
rival
the
beauty
of
the
good
grecian
architecture
;
and
it
be
as
commodious
within
as
venerable
without

<EOS>
It
stand
on
the
south
-
east
side
of
a
hill
,
but
nearer
the
bottom
than
the
top
of
it

so
as
to
be
shelter
from
the
north
-
east
by
a
grove
of
old
oak
which
rise
above
it
in
a
gradual
ascent
of
near
half
a

high

a
ridge

wild

<EOS>
It

that
lovely

than

could

glorious

and
that
Mr

meditate
in

may
render

<EOS>
reader
,
take
care
.
<EOS>
I
have
unadvisedly
lead
thee
to
the
top
of
as
high
a
hill
as
Mr
Allworthy
's
,
and
how
to
get
thee
down
without
break
thy
neck
,
I
do
not
well
know
.
<EOS>
however
,
let
us
e'en
venture
to
slide
down
together
;
for
Miss
Bridget
ring
her
bell
,
and
Mr
Allworthy
be
summon
to
breakfast
,
where
I
must
attend
,
and
,
if
you
please
,
shall
be
glad
of
your
company
.
  
<EOS>
the
usual
compliment
have
past
between
Mr
Allworthy
and
Miss
Bridget
,
and
the
tea
being
pour
out
,
he
summon
Mrs
Wilkins
,
and
tell
his
sister
he
have
a
present
for
her
,
for
which
she
thank
him
 
imagine
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
it
have
be
a
gown
,
or
some
ornament
for
her
person
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
very
often
make
her
such
present
;
and
she
,
in
complacence
to
him
,
spend
much
time
in
adorn
herself
.
<EOS>
I
say
in
complacence
to
him
,
because
she
always
exprest
the
great
contempt
for
dress
,
and
for
those
lady
who
make
it
their
study
.
  
<EOS>
but
if
such
be
her
expectation
,
how
be
she
disappoint
when
Mrs
Wilkins
,
accord
to
the
order
she
have
receive
from
her
master
,
produce
the
little
infant
?
<EOS>
great
surprize
,
as
hath
be
observe
,
be
apt
to
be
silent
;
and
so
be
Miss
Bridget
,
till
her
brother
begin
,
and
tell
her
the
whole
story
,
which
,
as
the
reader
know
it
already
,
we
shall
not
repeat
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Bridget
have
always
expr
<EOS>
so
great
a
regard
for
what
the
lady
be
pleased
to
call
virtue
,
and
have
herself
maintain
such
a
severity
of
character
,
that
it
be
expect
,
especially
by
Wilkins
,
that
she
would
have
vent
much
bitterness
on
this
occasion
,
and
would
have
vote
for
send
the
child
,
as
a
kind
of
noxious
animal
,
immediately
out
of
the
house
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
she
rather
take
the
good
-
natured
side
of
the
question
,
intimate
some
compassion
for
the
helpless
little
creature
,
and
commend
her
brother
's
charity
in
what
he
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
the
reader
may
account
for
this
behaviour
from
her
condescension
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
when
we
have
inform
him
that
the
good
man
have
end
his
narrative
with
own
a
resolution
to
take
care
of
the
child
,
and
to
breed
him
up
as
his
own
;
for
,
to
acknowledge
the
truth
,
she
be
always
ready
to
oblige
her
brother
,
and
very
seldom
,
if
ever
,
contradict
his
sentiment
.
<EOS>
She
would
,
indeed
,
sometimes
make
a
few
observation
,
as
that
man
be
headstrong
,
and
must
have
their
own
way
,
and
would
wish
she
have
be
bless
with
an
independent
fortune
;
but
these
be
always
vent
in
a
low
voice
,
and
at
the
most
amounted
only
to
what
be
call
muttering
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
what
she
withhold
from
the
infant
,
she
bestow
with
the
utmost
profuseness
on
the
poor
unknown
mother
,
whom
she
call
an
impudent
slut
,
a
wanton
hussy
,
an
audacious
harlot
,
a
wicked
jade
,
a
vile
strumpet
,
with
every
other
appellation
with
which
the
tongue
of
virtue
never
fail
to
lash
those
who
bring
a
disgrace
on
the
sex
.
  
<EOS>
a
consultation
be
now
enter
into
how
to
proceed
in
order
to
discover
the
mother
.
<EOS>
a
scrutiny
be
first
make
into
the
character
of
the
female
servant
of
the
house
,
who
be
all
acquit
by
Mrs
Wilkins
,
and
with
apparent
merit
;
for
she
have
collect
them
herself
,
and
perhaps
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
such
another
set
of
scarecrow
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
step
be
to
examine
among
the
inhabitant
of
the
parish
;
and
this
be
refer
to
Mrs
Wilkins
,
who
be
to
enquire
with
all
imaginable
diligence
,
and
to
make
her
report
in
the
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
matter
be
thus
settle
,
Mr
Allworthy
withdraw
to
his
study
,
as
be
his
custom
,
and
leave
the
child
to
his
sister
,
who
,
at
his
desire
,
have
undertake
the
care
of
it
.
    
<EOS>
contain
a
few
common
matter
,
with
a
very
uncommon
observation
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
when
her
master
be
depart
,
Mrs
Deborah
stand
silent
,
expect
her
cue
from
Miss
Bridget
;
for
as
to
what
have
past
before
her
master
,
the
prudent
housekeeper
by
no
mean
rely
upon
it
,
as
she
have
often
know
the
sentiment
of
the
lady
in
her
brother
's
absence
to
differ
greatly
from
those
which
she
have
express
in
his
presence
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bridget
do
not
,
however
,
suffer
her
to
continue
long
in
this
doubtful
situation
;
for
have
look
some
time
earnestly
at
the
child
,
as
it
lie
asleep
in
the
lap
of
Mrs
Deborah
,
the
good
lady
could
not
forbear
give
it
a
hearty
kiss
,
at
the
same
time
declare
herself
wonderfully
pleased
with
its
beauty
and
innocence
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Deborah
no
sooner
observe
this
than
she
fall
to
squeezing
and
kissing
,
with
as
great
rapture
as
sometimes
inspire
the
sage
dame
of
forty
and
five
towards
a
youthful
and
vigorous
bridegroom
,
cry
out
,
in
a
shrill
voice
,
"
o
,
the
dear
little
creature
!
 
<EOS>
the
dear
,
sweet
,
pretty
creature
!
<EOS>
well
,
I
vow
it
be
as
fine
<EOS>
a
boy
as
ever
be
see
!
"
  
<EOS>
these
exclamation
continue
till
they
be
interrupt
by
the
lady
,
who
now
proceed
to
execute
the
commission
give
her
by
her
brother
,
and
give
order
for
provide
all
necessary
for
the
child
,
appoint
a
very
good
room
in
the
house
for
his
nursery
.
<EOS>
Her
order
be
indeed
so
liberal
,
that
,
have
it
be
a
child
of
her
own
,
she
could
not
have
exceed
them
;
but
,
lest
the
virtuous
reader
may
condemn
her
for
show
too
great
regard
to
a
base
-
bear
infant
,
to
which
all
charity
be
condemn
by
law
as
irreligious
,
we
think
proper
to
observe
that
she
conclude
the
whole
with
say
,
"
<EOS>
since
it
be
her
brother
's
whim
to
adopt
the
little
brat
,
she
suppose
little
master
must
be
treat
with
great
tenderness
.
<EOS>
for
her
part
,
she
could
not
help
think
it
be
an
encouragement
to
vice
;
but
that
she
know
too
much
of
the
obstinacy
of
mankind
to
oppose
any
of
their
ridiculous
humour
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
reflection
of
this
nature
she
usually
,
as
have
be
hint
,
accompany
every
act
of
compliance
with
her
brother
's
inclination
;
and
surely
nothing
could
more
contribute
to
heighten
the
merit
of
this
compliance
than
a
declaration
that
she
know
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
folly
and
unreasonableness
of
those
inclination
to
which
she
submit
.
<EOS>
tacit
obedience
imply
no
force
upon
the
will
,
and
consequently
may
be
easily
,
and
without
any
pain
,
preserve
;
but
when
a
wife
,
a
child
,
a
relation
,
or
a
friend
,
perform
what
we
desire
,
with
grumbling
and
reluctance
,
with
expression
of
dislike
and
dissatisfaction
,
the
manif
difficulty
which
they
undergo
must
greatly
enhance
the
obligation
.
  
<EOS>
as
this
be
one
of
those
deep
observation
which
very
few
reader
can
be
suppose
capable
of
make
themselves
,
I
have
think
proper
to
lend
them
my
assistance
;
but
this
be
a
favour
rarely
to
be
expect
in
the
course
of
my
work
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
shall
seldom
or
never
so
indulge
him
,
unless
in
such
instance
as
this
,
where
nothing
but
the
inspiration
with
which
we
writer
be
gift
,
can
possibly
enable
any
one
to
make
the
discovery
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Deborah
be
introduce
into
the
parish
with
a
simile
.
<EOS>
a
short
account
of
Jenny
Jones
,
with
the
difficulty
and
discouragement
which
may
attend
young
woman
in
the
pursuit
of
learning
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Deborah
,
have
dispose
of
the
child
accord
to
the
will
of
her
master
,
now
prepare
to
visit
those
habitation
which
be
suppose
to
conceal
its
mother
.
  
<EOS>
not
otherwise
than
when
a
kite
,
tremendous
bird
,
be
behold
by
the
feather
generation
soar
aloft
,
and
hover
over
their
head
,
the
amorous
dove
,
and
every
innocent
little
bird
,
spread
wide
the
alarm
,
and
fly
tremble
to
their
hiding
-
place
.
<EOS>
He
proudly
beat
the
air
,
conscious
of
his
dignity
,
and
meditate
intend
mischief
.
  
<EOS>
so
when
the
approach
of
Mrs
Deborah
be
proclaim
through
the
street
,
all
the
inhabitant
run
tremble
into
their
house
,
each
matron
dread
lest
the
visit
should
fall
to
her
lot
.
<EOS>
She
with
stately
step
proudly
advance
over
the
field
:
<EOS>
aloft
she
bear
her
tower
head
,
fill
with
conceit
of
her
own
pre
-
eminence
,
and
scheme
to
effect
her
intend
discovery
.
  
<EOS>
the
sagacious
reader
will
not
from
this
simile
imagine
these
poor
people
have
any
apprehension
of
the
design
with
which
Mrs
Wilkins
be
now
come
towards
them
;
but
as
the
great
beauty
of
the
simile
may
possibly
sleep
these
hundred
year
,
till
some
future
commentator
shall
take
this
work
in
hand
,
I
think
proper
to
lend
the
reader
a
little
assistance
in
this
place
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
my
intention
,
therefore
,
to
signify
,
that
,
as
it
be
the
nature
of
a
kite
to
devour
little
bird
,
so
be
it
the
nature
of
such
person
as
Mrs
Wilkins
to
insult
and
tyrannize
over
little
people
.
<EOS>
this
be
indeed
the
mean
which
they
use
to
recompense
to
themselves
their
extreme
servility
and
condescension
to
their
superior
;
for
nothing
can
be
more
reasonable
,
than
that
slave
and
flatterer
should
exact
the
same
taxis
on
all
below
them
,
which
they
themselves
pay
to
all
above
them
.
  
<EOS>
whenever
Mrs
Deborah
have
occasion
to
exert
any
extraordinary
condescension
to
Mrs
Bridget
,
and
by
that
mean
have
a
little
sour
her
natural
disposition
,
it
be
usual
with
her
to
walk
forth
among
these
people
,
in
order
to
refine
her
temper
,
by
vent
,
and
,
as
it
be
,
purge
off
all
ill
humour
;
on
which
account
she
be
by
no
mean
a
welcome
visitant
:
to
say
the
truth
,
she
be
universally
dread
and
hate
by
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
on
her
arrival
in
this
place
,
she
go
immediately
to
the
habitation
of
an
elderly
matron
;
to
whom
,
as
this
matron
have
the
good
fortune
to
resemble
herself
in
the
comeliness
of
her
person
,
as
well
as
in
her
age
,
she
have
generally
be
more
favourable
than
to
any
of
the
rest
.
<EOS>
to
this
woman
she
impart
what
have
happen
,
and
the
design
upon
which
she
be
come
thither
that
morning
.
<EOS>
these
two
begin
presently
to
scrutinize
the
character
of
the
several
young
girl
who
live
in
any
of
those
house
,
and
at
last
fix
their
strong
suspicion
on
one
Jenny
Jones
,
who
,
they
both
agree
,
be
the
likeliest
person
to
have
commit
this
fact
.
  
<EOS>
this
Jenny
Jones
be
no
very
comely
girl
,
either
in
her
face
or
person
;
but
nature
have
somewhat
compensate
the
want
of
beauty
with
what
be
generally
more
esteem
by
those
lady
whose
judgment
be
arrive
at
year
of
perfect
maturity
,
for
she
have
give
her
a
very
uncommon
share
of
understanding
.
<EOS>
this
gift
Jenny
have
a
good
deal
improve
by
erudition
.
<EOS>
She
have
live
several
year
a
servant
with
a
schoolmaster
,
who
,
discover
a
great
quickness
of
part
in
the
girl
,
and
an
extraordinary
desire
of
learn
 
for
every
leisure
hour
<EOS>
she
be
always
find
read
in
the
book
of
the
scholar
 
have
the
good
-
nature
,
or
folly
 
just
as
the
reader
please
to
call
it
 
to
instruct
her
so
far
,
that
she
obtain
a
competent
skill
in
the
latin
language
,
and
be
,
perhaps
,
as
good
a
scholar
as
most
of
the
young
man
of
quality
of
the
age
.
<EOS>
this
advantage
,
however
,
like
most
other
of
an
extraordinary
kind
,
be
attend
with
some
small
inconvenience
:
for
as
it
be
not
to
be
wonder
at
,
that
a
young
woman
so
well
accomplished
should
have
little
relish
for
the
society
of
those
whom
fortune
have
make
her
equal
,
but
whom
education
have
render
so
much
her
inferior
;
so
be
it
matter
of
no
great
astonishment
,
that
this
superiority
in
Jenny
,
together
with
that
behaviour
which
be
its
certain
consequence
,
should
produce
among
the
rest
some
little
envy
and
ill
-
will
towards
her
;
and
these
have
,
perhaps
,
secretly
burn
in
the
bosom
of
her
neighbour
ever
since
her
return
from
her
service
.
  
<EOS>
Their
envy
do
not
,
however
,
display
itself
openly
,
till
poor
Jenny
,
to
the
surprize
of
everybody
,
and
to
the
vexation
of
all
the
young
woman
in
these
part
,
have
publickly
shine
forth
on
a
Sunday
in
a
new
silk
gown
,
with
a
laced
cap
,
and
other
proper
appendage
to
these
.
  
<EOS>
the
flame
,
which
have
before
lain
in
embryo
,
now
burst
forth
.
<EOS>
Jenny
have
,
by
her
learning
,
increase
her
own
pride
,
which
none
of
her
neighbour
be
kind
enough
to
feed
with
the
honour
she
seem
to
demand
;
and
now
,
instead
of
respect
and
adoration
,
she
gain
nothing
but
hatred
and
abuse
by
her
finery
.
<EOS>
the
whole
parish
declare
she
could
not
come
honestly
by
such
thing
;
and
parent
,
instead
of
wish
their
daughter
the
same
,
felicitate
themselves
that
their
child
have
them
not
.
  
<EOS>
hence
,
perhaps
,
it
be
,
that
the
good
woman
first
mention
the
name
of
this
poor
girl
to
Mrs
Wilkins
;
but
there
be
another
circumstance
that
confirm
the
latter
in
her
suspicion
;
for
Jenny
have
lately
be
often
at
Mr
Allworthy
's
house
.
<EOS>
She
have
officiate
as
nurse
to
Miss
Bridget
,
in
a
violent
fit
of
illness
,
and
have
sit
up
many
night
with
that
lady
;
besides
which
,
she
have
be
see
there
the
very
day
before
Mr
Allworthy
's
return
,
by
Mrs
Wilkins
herself
,
though
that
sagacious
person
have
not
at
first
conceive
any
suspicion
of
her
on
that
account
:
for
,
as
she
herself
say
,
"
She
have
always
esteem
Jenny
as
a
very
sober
girl
(
though
indeed
she
know
very
little
of
her
)
,
and
have
rather
suspect
some
of
those
wanton
trollop
,
who
give
themselves
air
,
because
,
forsooth
,
they
think
themselves
handsome
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jenny
be
now
summon
to
appear
in
person
before
Mrs
Deborah
,
which
she
immediately
do
.
<EOS>
when
Mrs
Deborah
,
put
on
the
gravity
of
a
judge
,
with
somewhat
more
than
his
austerity
,
begin
an
oration
with
the
word
,
"
You
audacious
strumpet
!
"
<EOS>
in
which
she
proceed
rather
to
pass
sentence
on
the
prisoner
than
to
accuse
her
.
  
<EOS>
though
Mrs
Deborah
be
fully
satisfied
of
the
guilt
of
Jenny
,
from
the
reason
above
shew
,
it
be
possible
Mr
Allworthy
may
have
require
some
strong
evidence
to
have
convict
her
;
but
she
save
her
accuser
any
such
trouble
,
by
freely
confess
the
whole
fact
with
which
she
be
charge
.
  
<EOS>
this
confession
,
though
deliver
rather
in
term
of
contrition
,
as
it
appear
,
do
not
at
all
mollify
<EOS>
Mrs
Deborah
,
who
now
pronounce
a
second
judgment
against
her
,
in
more
opprobrious
language
than
before
;
nor
have
it
any
well
success
with
the
bystander
,
who
be
now
grow
very
numerous
.
<EOS>
many
of
them
cry
out
,
"
They
think
what
madam
's
silk
gown
would
end
in
;
"
other
speak
sarcastically
of
her
learning
.
<EOS>
not
a
single
female
be
present
but
find
some
mean
of
express
her
abhorrence
of
poor
Jenny
,
who
bear
all
very
patiently
,
except
the
malice
of
one
woman
,
who
reflect
upon
her
person
,
and
toss
up
her
nose
,
say
,
"
the
man
must
have
a
good
stomach
who
would
give
silk
gown
for
such
sort
of
trumpery
!
"
<EOS>
Jenny
reply
to
this
with
a
bitterness
which
may
have
surprize
a
judicious
person
,
who
have
observe
the
tranquillity
with
which
she
bear
all
the
affront
to
her
chastity
;
but
her
patience
be
perhaps
tired
out
,
for
this
be
a
virtue
which
be
very
apt
to
be
fatigue
by
exercise
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Deborah
have
succeed
beyond
her
hope
in
her
inquiry
,
return
with
much
triumph
,
and
,
at
the
appoint
hour
,
make
a
faithful
report
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
who
be
much
surprize
at
the
relation
;
for
he
have
hear
of
the
extraordinary
part
and
improvement
of
this
girl
,
whom
he
intend
to
have
give
in
marriage
,
together
with
a
small
living
,
to
a
neighbouring
curate
.
<EOS>
His
concern
,
therefore
,
on
this
occasion
,
be
at
least
equal
to
the
satisfaction
which
appear
in
Mrs
Deborah
,
and
to
many
reader
may
seem
much
more
reasonable
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Bridget
bless
herself
,
and
say
,
"
for
her
part
,
she
should
never
hereafter
entertain
a
good
opinion
of
any
woman
.
"
<EOS>
for
Jenny
before
this
have
the
happiness
of
be
much
in
her
good
grace
also
.
  
<EOS>
the
prudent
housekeeper
be
again
dispatch
to
bring
the
unhappy
culprit
before
Mr
Allworthy
,
in
order
,
not
as
it
be
hope
by
some
,
and
expect
by
all
,
to
be
send
to
the
house
of
correction
,
but
to
receive
wholesome
admonition
and
reproof
;
which
those
who
relish
that
kind
of
instructive
writing
may
peruse
in
the
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
contain
such
grave
matter
,
that
the
reader
can
not
laugh
once
through
the
whole
chapter
,
unless
peradventure
he
should
laugh
at
the
author
.
 
<EOS>
when
Jenny
appear
,
Mr
Allworthy
take
her
into
his
study
,
and
speak
to
her
as
follow
:
"
You
know
,
child
,
it
be
in
my
power
as
a
magistrate
,
to
punish
you
very
rigorously
for
what
you
have
do
;
and
you
will
,
perhaps
,
be
the
more
apt
to
fear
I
should
execute
that
power
,
because
you
have
in
a
manner
lay
your
sin
at
my
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
perhaps
,
this
be
one
reason
which
hath
determine
me
to
act
in
a
milder
manner
with
you
:
for
,
as
no
private
resentment
should
ever
influence
a
magistrate
,
I
will
be
so
far
from
consider
your
have
deposit
the
infant
in
my
house
as
an
aggravation
of
your
offence
,
that
I
will
suppose
,
in
your
favour
,
this
to
have
proceed
from
a
natural
affection
to
your
child
,
since
you
may
have
some
hope
to
see
it
thus
better
provide
for
than
be
in
the
power
of
yourself
,
or
its
wicked
father
,
to
provide
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
should
indeed
have
be
highly
offend
with
<EOS>
you
have
you
expose
the
little
wretch
in
the
manner
of
some
inhuman
mother
,
who
seem
no
less
to
have
abandon
their
humanity
,
than
to
have
part
with
their
chastity
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
other
part
of
your
offence
,
therefore
,
upon
which
I
intend
to
admonish
you
,
I
mean
the
violation
of
your
chastity
;
 
a
crime
,
however
lightly
it
may
be
treat
by
debauch
person
,
very
heinous
in
itself
,
and
very
dreadful
in
its
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
heinous
nature
of
this
offence
must
be
sufficiently
apparent
to
every
Christian
,
inasmuch
as
it
be
commit
in
defiance
of
the
law
of
our
religion
,
and
of
the
express
command
of
Him
who
found
that
religion
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
here
its
consequence
may
well
be
argue
to
be
dreadful
;
for
what
can
be
more
so
,
than
to
incur
the
divine
displeasure
,
by
the
breach
of
the
divine
command
;
and
that
in
an
instance
against
which
the
high
vengeance
be
specifically
denounce
?
  
<EOS>
"
but
these
thing
,
though
too
little
,
I
be
afraid
,
regard
,
be
so
plain
,
that
mankind
,
however
they
may
want
to
be
remind
,
can
never
need
information
on
this
head
.
<EOS>
a
hint
,
therefore
,
to
awaken
your
sense
of
this
matter
,
shall
suffice
;
for
I
would
inspire
you
with
repentance
,
and
not
drive
you
to
desperation
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
other
consequence
,
not
indeed
so
dreadful
or
replete
with
horror
as
this
;
and
yet
such
,
as
,
if
attentively
consider
,
must
,
one
would
think
,
deter
all
of
your
sex
at
least
from
the
commission
of
this
crime
.
  
<EOS>
"
for
by
it
you
be
render
infamous
,
and
drive
,
like
leper
of
old
,
out
of
society
;
at
least
,
from
the
society
of
all
but
wicked
and
reprobate
person
;
for
no
other
will
associate
with
you
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
have
fortune
,
you
be
hereby
render
incapable
of
enjoy
them
;
if
you
have
none
,
you
be
disabled
from

any

to
caution

strengthen
you
for
the

to

Mr

whom
the
least
mention
of
those
sacred
word
be
sufficient
to
stagger
,
hesitate
a
moment
before
he
reply
,
and
then
tell
her
,
she
have
do
wrong
to
enter
into
such
engagement
to
a
villain
;
but
since
she
have
,
he
could
not
insist
on
her
break
them
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
it
be
not
from
a
motive
of
vain
curiosity
he
have
inquire

in
order
to
punish
the

at

,
that

may
not
ignorantly
confer
favour

<EOS>
as
to
these
point

Jenny
satisfy
him
by
the
most
solemn
assurance

that
the

be
entirely
out

be
neither

the
ingenuity

this
behaviour
have
gain
Jenny
so
much
credit
with
this
worthy
man

that
he
easily
believe
what
she
tell
him

for
as
she
have
disdain
to
excuse
herself
by
a
lie

have
hazard
his
further
displeasure
in
her
present
situation

rather

forfeit

honour

integrity
by
betray
another

he
have

<EOS>
little
apprehension
that
she
would
be
guilty
of
falsehood

therefore
dismiss
her
with
assurance
that
he
would
very
soon
remove
her
out
of

reach
of
that
obloquy
she
have
incur

conclude
with
some
additional
document

in
which
he
recommend
repentance

"

the
instructive
lecture
deliver
by
Mr

indeed
every

this

door
be
indeed
as
well
known

have
be
as
frequently
apply
to
by
her
,
as
the
famous
hole
in
the
wall
be
by
Thisbe
of
old

<EOS>
this
serve
to
many
good
purpose

<EOS>
for
by
such
mean
Mrs
Bridget
become
often
acquaint
with
her
brother

inclination
,
without
give
him
the
trouble
of
repeat
them
to
her

<EOS>
It
be
true
,
some
inconvenience
attend
this
intercourse

and
she
have
sometimes
reason
to
cry
out
with
Thisbe
,
in
Shakspeare

"
o

wicked

wicked

as
Mr

certain
thing
occur
in
examination
concern
bastard

such
like

which
be
apt
to
give
great
offence
to
the
chaste
ear
of
virgin
,
especially
when
they
approach
the
age
of
forty
,
as
be
the
case
of
Mrs

<EOS>
however
,
she
have
,
on
such
occasion
,
the
advantage
of
conceal
her
blush
from
the
eye
of
man

<EOS>
both
the
good
woman
keep
strict
silence
during
the
whole
scene
between
Mr

but
as
soon
as
it
be
end
,
and
that
gentleman
be
out
of
hearing
,
Mrs
Deborah
could
not
help
exclaim
against
the
clemency
of
her
master
,
and
especially
against
his
suffering
her
to
conceal
the
father
of
the
child
,
which
she
swear
she
would
have
out
of
her
before
the
sun
set

<EOS>
at
these
word
Mrs
Bridget
discompose
her
feature
with
a
smile
(
a
thing
very
unusual
to
her
)
.
<EOS>
not
that
I
would
have
my
reader
imagine

that
this
be
one
of
those
wanton
smile
which
Homer
would
have
you
conceive
come
from
Venus
,
when
he
call
her
the
laughter
-
love
goddess

nor
be
it
one
of
those
smile
which
Lady
Seraphina
shoot
from
the
stage
-
box
,
and
which
Venus
would
quit
her
immortality
to
be
able
to
equal
.
<EOS>
no
,
this
be
rather
one
of
those
smile
which
may
be
suppose
to
have
come
from
the
dimpled
cheek
of
the
august
Tisiphone
,
or
from
one
of
the
miss
,
her
sister

<EOS>
with
such
a
smile
then
,
and
with
a
voice
sweet
as

evening
breeze
of
Boreas
in
the
pleasant
month
of
November
,
Mrs
Bridget
gently
reprove
the
curiosity
of
Mrs
Deborah
;
a
vice
with
which
it
seem
the
latter
be
too
much
tainted
,
and
which
the
former
inveigh
against
with
great
bitterness
,
add
,
"
that
,
among
all
her
fault
,
she
thank
Heaven
her
enemy
could
not
accuse
her
of
pry
into
the
affair
of
other
people

<EOS>
She
then
proceed
to
commend
the
honour
and
spirit
with
which
Jenny
have
act

<EOS>
She
say
,
she
could
not
help
agree
with
her
brother
,
that
there
be
some
merit
in
the
sincerity
of
her
confession
,
and
in
her
integrity
to
her
lover
:
that
she
have
always
think
her
a
very
good
girl
,
and
doubt
<EOS>
not
<EOS>
but
she
have
be
seduce
by
some
rascal
,
who
have
be
infinitely
more
to
blame
than
herself
,
and
very
probably
have
prevail
with
her
by
a
promise
of
marriage
,
or
some
other
treacherous
proceeding
.
  
<EOS>
this
behaviour
of
Mrs
Bridget
greatly
surprise
Mrs
Deborah
;
for
this
well
-
breed
woman
seldom
open
her
lip
,
either
to
her
master
or
his
sister
,
till
she
have
first
sound
their
inclination
,
with
which
her
sentiment
be
always
consonant
.
<EOS>
here
,
however
,
she
think
she
may
have
launch
forth
with
safety
;
and
the
sagacious
reader
will
not
perhaps
accuse
her
of
want
of
sufficient
forecast
in
so
do
,
but
will
rather
admire
with
what
wonderful
celerity
she
tack
about
,
when
she
find
herself
steer
a
wrong
course
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
madam

"
say
this
able
woman

I
must
own
I
can
not
help
admire
the
girl

spirit
,
as
well
as
your
ladyship

<EOS>
and
,
as
your
ladyship
say
,
if
she
be
deceive
by
some
wicked
man

the
poor
wretch
be
to
be
pity

<EOS>
and
to
be
sure
,
as
your
ladyship
say
,
the
girl
hath
always
appear
like
a
good
,
honest
,
plain
girl
,
and
not
vain
of
her
face
,
forsooth

as
some
wanton
hussey
in

neighbourhood
be

You
say
true

"
say

"
if
the
girl
have
be
one
of
those
vain
trollop
,
of
which
we
have
too
many
in
the
parish

I
should
have
condemn
my
brother
for
his
lenity
towards
her
.
<EOS>
I
see
two
farmer
'
daughter
at
church
,
the
other
day
,
with
bare
neck
.
<EOS>
I
protest
they
shock
me
.
<EOS>
if
wench
will
hang
out
lur
for
fellow
,
it
be
no
matter
what
they
suffer
.
<EOS>
I
detest
such
creature
;
and
it
would
be
much
well
for
them
that
their
face
have
be
seam
with
the
smallpox
;
but
I
must
confess
,
I
never
see
any
of
this
wanton
behaviour
in
poor
Jenny
:
some
artful
villain
,
I
be
convince
,
hath
betrayed
,
nay
perhaps
force
her
;
and
I
pity
the
poor
wretch
with
all
my
heart
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Deborah
approve
all
these
sentiment
,
and
the
dialogue
conclude
with
a
general
and
bitter
invective
against
beauty
,
and
with
many
compassionate
consideration
for
all
honest
plain
girl
who
be
delude
by
the
wicked
art
of
deceitful
man
.
    
<EOS>
contain
matter
which
will
surprize
the
reader
.
 
<EOS>
Jenny
return
home
well
pleased
with
the
reception
she
have
meet
with
from
Mr
Allworthy
,
whose
indulgence
to
her
she
industriously
make
public
;
partly
perhaps
as
a
sacrifice
to
her
own
pride
,
and
partly
from
the
more
prudent
motive
of
reconcile
her
neighbour
to
her
,
and
silence
their
clamour
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
this
latter
view
,
if
she
indeed
have
it
,
may
appear
reasonable
enough
,
yet
the
event
do
not
answer
her
expectation
;
for
when
she
be
convene
before
the
justice
,
and
it
be
universally
apprehend
that
the
house
of
correction
would
have
be
her
fate
,
though
some
of
the
young
woman
cry
out
"
<EOS>
It
be
good
enough
for
her
,
"
and
divert
themselves
with
the
thought
of
her
beat
hemp
in
a
silk
gown
;
yet
there
be
many
other
who
begin
to
pity
her
condition
:
but
when
it
be
know
in
what
manner
Mr
Allworthy
have
behave
,
the
tide
turn
against
her
.
<EOS>
one
say
,
"
I
will
assure
you
,
madam
hath
have
good
luck
.
"
<EOS>
a
second
cryed
,
"
see
what
it
be
to
be
a
favourite
!
"
<EOS>
a
third
,
"
ay
,
this
come
of
her
learning
.
<EOS>
"
every
person
make
some
malicious
comment
or
other
on
the
occasion
,
and
reflect
on
the
partiality
of
the
justice
.
  
<EOS>
the
behaviour
of
these
people
may
appear
impolitic
and
ungrateful
to
the
reader
,
who
consider
the
power
and
benevolence
of
Mr
Allworthy
.
<EOS>
but
as
to
his
power
,
he
never
use
it
;
and
as
to
his
benevolence
,
he
exert
so
much
,
that
he
have
thereby
disoblige
all
his
neighbour
;
for
it
be
a
secret
well
known
to
great
man
,
that
,
by
confer
an
obligation
,
they
do
not
always
procure
a
friend
,
but
be
certain
of
create
many
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
Jenny
be
,
however
,
by
the
care
and
goodness
of
Mr
Allworthy
,
soon
remove
out
of
the
reach
of
reproach
;
when
malice
be
no
longer
able
to
vent
its
rage
on
her
,
begin
to
seek
another
object
of
its
bitterness
,
and
this
be
no
less
than
Mr
Allworthy
,
himself
;
for
a
whisper
soon
go
abroad
,
that
he
himself
be
the
father
of
the
foundle
child
.
  
<EOS>
this
supposition
so
well
reconcile
his
conduct
to
the
general
opinion
,
that
it
meet
with
universal
assent
;
and
the
outcry
against
his
lenity
soon
begin
to
take
another
turn
,
and
be
change
into
an
invective
against
his
cruelty
to
the
poor
girl
.
<EOS>
very
grave
and
good
woman
exclaim
against
man
who
beget
child
,
and
then
disown
them
.
<EOS>
nor
be
there
want
some
,
who
,
after
the
departure
of
Jenny
,
insinuate
that
she
be
spirit
away
with
a
design
too
black
to
be
mention
,
and
who
give
frequent
hint
that
a
legal
inquiry
ought
to
be
make
into
the
whole
matter
,
and
that
some
people
should
be
force
to
produce
the
girl
.
  
<EOS>
these
calumny
may
have
probably
produce
ill
consequence
,
at
the
least
may
have
occasion
some
trouble
,
to
a
person
of
a
more
doubtful
and
suspicious
character
than
Mr
Allworthy
be
bless
with
;
but
in
his
case
they
have
no
such
effect
;
and
,
be
heartily
despise
by
him
,
they
serve
only
to
afford
an
innocent
amusement
to
the
good
gossip
of
the
neighbourhood
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
we
can
not
possibly
divine
what
complection
our
reader
may
be
of
,
and
as
it
will
be
some
time
before
he
will
hear
any
more
of
Jenny
,
we
think
proper
to
give
him
a
very
early
intimation
,
that
Mr
Allworthy
be
,
and
will
hereafter
appear
to
be
,
absolutely
innocent
of
any
criminal
intention
whatever
.
<EOS>
He
have
indeed
commit
no
other
than
an
error
in
politic
,
by
temper
justice
with
mercy
,
and
by
refuse
to
gratify
the
good
-
natured
disposition
of
the
mob
,
[
*
]
with
an
object
for
their
compassion
to
work
on
in
the
person
of
poor
Jenny
,
whom
,
in
order
to
pity
,
they
desire
to
have
see
sacrifice
to
ruin
and
infamy
,
by
a
shameful
correction
in
Bridewell
.
    
<EOS>
[

]
<EOS>
whenever
this
word
occur
in
our
writing
,
it
intend
person
  
without
virtue
or
sense
,
in
all
station
;
and
many
of
the
high
  
rank
be
often
mean
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
so
far
from
comply
with
this
their
inclination
,
by
which
all
hope
of
reformation
would
have
be
abolish
,
and
even
the
gate
shut
against
her
if
her
own
inclination
should
ever
hereafter
lead
her
to
chuse
the
road
of
virtue
,
Mr
Allworthy
rather
choose
to
encourage
the
girl
to
return
thither
by
the
only
possible
mean
;
for
too
true
I
be
afraid
it
be
,
that
many
woman
have
become
abandon
,
and
have
sink
to
the
last
degree
of
vice
,
by
be
unable
to
retrieve
the
first
slip
.
<EOS>
this
will
be
,
I
be
afraid
,
always
the
case
while
they
remain
among
their
former
acquaintance
;
it
be
therefore
wisely
do
by
Mr
Allworthy
,
to
remove
Jenny
to
a
place
where
she
may
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
reputation
,
after
have
taste
the
ill
consequence
of
lose
it
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
place
therefore
,
wherever
it
be
,
we
will
wish
her
a
good
journey
,
and
for
the
present
take
leave
of
her
,
and
of
the
little
foundle
her
child
,
have
matter
of
much
high
importance
to
communicate
to
the
reader
.
    
<EOS>
the
hospitality
of
Allworthy
;
with
a
short
sketch
of
the
character
of
two
brother
,
a
doctor
and
a
captain
,
who
be
entertain
by
that
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
neither
Mr
Allworthy
's
house
,
nor
his
heart
,
be
shut
against
any
part
of
mankind
,
but
they
be
both
more
particularly
open
to
man
of
merit
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
this
be
the
only
house
in
the
kingdom
where
you
be
sure
to
gain
a
dinner
by
deserve
it
.
  
<EOS>
above
all
other
,
man
of
genius
and
learning
share
the
principal
place
in
his
favour
;
and
in
these
he
have
much
discernment
:
for
though
he
have
miss
the
advantage
of
a
learned
education
,
yet
,
be
bless
with
vast
natural
ability
<EOS>
,
he
have
so
well
profit
by
a
vigorous
though
late
application
to
letter
,
and
by
much
conversation
with
man
of
eminence
in
this
way
,
that
he
be
himself
a
very
competent
judge
in
most
kind
of
literature
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
no
wonder
that
in
an
age
when
this
kind
of
merit
be
so
little
in
fashion
,
and
so
slenderly
provide
for
,
person
possess
of
it
should
very
eagerly
flock
to
a
place
where
they
be
sure
of
be
receive
with
great
complaisance
;
indeed
,
where
they
may
enjoy
almost
the
same
advantage
of
a
liberal
fortune
as
if
they
be
entitle
to
it
in
their
own
right
;
for
Mr
Allworthy
be
not
one
of
those
generous
person
who
be
ready
most
bountifully
to
bestow
meat
,
drink
,
and
lodge
on
man
of
wit
and
learning
,
for
which
they
expect
no
other
return
but
entertainment
,
instruction
,
flattery
,
and
subserviency
;
in
a
word
,
that
such
person
should
be
enrol
in
the
number
of
domestic
,
without
wear
their
master
's
cloathe
,
or
receive
wage
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
every
person
in
this
house
be
perfect
master
of
his
own
time
:
and
as
he
may
at
his
pleasure
satisfy
all
his
appetite
within
the
restriction
only
of
law
,
virtue
,
and
religion
;
so
he
may
,
if
his
health
require
,
or
his
inclination
prompt
him
to
temperance
,
or
even
to
abstinence
,
absent
himself
from
any
meal
,
or
retire
from
them
,
whenever
he
be
so
disposed
,
without
even
a
sollicitation
to
the
contrary
:
for
,
indeed
,
such
sollicitation
from
superior
always
savour
very
strongly
of
command
.
<EOS>
but
all
here
be
free
from
such
impertinence
,
not
only
those
whose
company
be
in
all
other
place
esteem
a
favour
from
their
equality
of
fortune
,
but
even
those
whose
indigent
circumstance
make
such
an
eleemosynary
abode
convenient
to
them
,
and
who
be
therefore
less
welcome
to
a
great
man
's
table
because
they
stand
in
need
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
among
other
of
this
kind
be
Dr
Blifil
,
a
gentleman
who
have
the
misfortune
of
lose
the
advantage
of
great
talent
by
the
obstinacy
of
a
father
,
who
would
breed
him
to
a
profession
he
dislike
.
<EOS>
in
obedience
to
this
obstinacy
the
doctor
have
in
his
youth
be
oblige
to
study
physic
,
or
rather
to
say
he
study
it
;
for
in
reality
book
of
this
kind
be
almost
the
only
one
with
which
he
be
unacquainted
;
and
unfortunately
for
him
,
the
doctor
be
master
of
almost
every
other
science
but
that
by
which
he
be
to
get
his
bread
;
the
consequence
of
which
be
,
that
the
doctor
at
the
age
of
forty
have
no
bread
to
eat
.
  
<EOS>
such
a
person
as
this
be
certain
to
find
a
welcome
at
Mr
Allworthy
's
table
,
to
whom
misfortune
be
ever
a
recommendation
,
when
they
be
derive
from
the
folly
or
villany
of
other
,
and
not
of
the
unfortunate
person
himself
.
<EOS>
besides
this
negative
merit
,
the
doctor
have
one
positive
recommendation
;
 
this
be
a
great
appearance
of
religion
.
<EOS>
whether
his
religion
be
real
,
or
consist
only
in
appearance
,
I
shall
not
presume
to
say
,
as
I
be
not
possess
of
any
touchstone
which
can
distinguish
the
true
from
the
false
.
  
<EOS>
if
this
part
of
his
character
please
Mr
Allworthy
,
it
delight
Miss
Bridget
.
<EOS>
She
engage
him
in
many
religious
controversy
;
on
which
occasion
she
constantly
express
great
satisfaction
in
the
doctor
's
knowledge
,
and
not
much
less
in
the
compliment
which
he
frequently
bestow
on
her
own
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
she
have
read
much
english
divinity
,
and
have
puzzle
more
than
one
of
the
neighbouring
curate
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
her
conversation
be
so
pure
<EOS>
,
her
look
so
sage
,
and
her
whole
deportment
so
grave
and
solemn
,
that
she
seem
to
deserve
the
name
of
saint
equally
with
her
namesake
,
or
with
any
other
female
in
the
roman
kalendar
.
  
<EOS>
as
sympathy
of
all
kind
be
apt
to
beget
love
,
so
experience
teach
us
that
none
have
a
more
direct
tendency
this
way
than
those
of
a
religious
kind
between
person
of
different
sex
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
find
himself
so
agreeable
to
Miss
Bridget
,
that
he
now
begin
to
lament
an
unfortunate
accident
which
have
happen
to
him
about
ten
year
before
;
namely
,
his
marriage
with
another
woman
,
who
be
not
only
still
alive
,
but
,
what
be
bad
,
know
to
be
so
by
Mr
Allworthy
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
fatal
bar
to
that
happiness
which
he
otherwise
see
sufficient
probability
of
obtain
with
this
young
lady
;
for
as
to
criminal
indulgence
,
he
certainly
never
think
of
them
.
<EOS>
this
be
owe
either
to
his
religion
,
as
be
most
probable
,
or
to
the
purity
of
his
passion
,
which
be
fix
on
those
thing
which
matrimony
only
,
and
not
criminal
correspondence
,
could
put
him
in
possession
of
,
or
could
give
him
any
title
to
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
not
long
ruminate
on
these
matter
,
before
it
occur
to
his
memory
that
he
have
a
brother
who
be
under
no
such
unhappy
incapacity
.
<EOS>
this
brother
he
make
no
doubt
would
succeed
;
for
he
discern
,
as
he
think
,
an
inclination
to
marriage
in
the
lady
;
and
the
reader
perhaps
,
when
he
hear
the
brother
's
qualification
,
will
not
blame
the
confidence
which
he
entertain
of
his
success
.
  
<EOS>
this
gentleman
be
about
thirty
-
five
year
of
age
.
<EOS>
He
be
of
a
middle
size
,
and
what
be
call
well
-
build
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
scar
on
his
forehead
,
which
do
not
so
much
injure
his
beauty
as
it
denote
his
valour
<EOS>
(
for
he
be
a
half
-
pay
officer
)
.
<EOS>
He
have
good
tooth
,
and
something
affable
,
when
he
please
,
in
his
smile
;
though
naturally
his
countenance
,
as
well
as
his
air
and
voice
,
have
much
of
roughness
in
it
:
yet
he
could
at
any
time
deposit
this
,
and
appear
all
gentleness
and
good
-
humour
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
ungenteel
,
nor
entirely
devoid
of
wit
,
and
in
his
youth
have
abound
in
sprightliness
,
which
,
though
he
have
lately
put
on
a
more
serious
character
,
he
could
,
when
he
please
,
resume
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
,
as
well
as
the
doctor
,
an
academic
education
;
for
his
father
have
,
with
the
same
paternal
authority
we
have
mention
before
,
decreed
him
for
holy
order
;
but
as
the
old
gentleman
die
before
he
be
ordain
,
he
choose
the
church
military
,
and
prefer
the
king
's
commission
to
the
bishop
's
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
purchase
the
post
of
lieutenant
of
dragoon
,
and
afterwards
come
to
be
a
captain
;
but
have
quarrel
with
his
colonel
,
be
by
his
interest
oblige
to
sell
;
from
which
time
he
have
entirely
rusticate
himself
,
have
betake
himself
to
study
the
scripture
,
and
be
not
a
little
suspect
of
an
inclination
to
methodism
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
,
therefore
,
not
unlikely
that
such
a
person
should
succeed
with
a
lady
of
so
saint
-
like
a
disposition
,
and
whose
inclination
be
no
otherwise
engage
than
to
the
marriage
state
in
general
;
but
why
the
doctor
,
who
certainly
have
no
great
friendship
for
his
brother
,
should
for
his
sake
think
of
make
so
ill
a
return
to
the
hospitality
of
Allworthy
,
be
a
matter
not
so
easy
to
be
account
for
.
  
<EOS>
be
it
that
some
nature
delight
in
evil
,
as
other
be
think
to
delight
in
virtue
?
<EOS>
or
be
there
a
pleasure
in
be
accessory
to
a
theft
when
we
can
not
commit
it
ourselves
?
<EOS>
or
lastly
(
which
experience
seem
to
make
probable
)
,
have
we
a
satisfaction
in
aggrandize
our
family
,
even
though
we
have
not
the
least
love
or
respect
for
them
?
  
<EOS>
whether
any
of
these
motive
operate
on
the
doctor
,
we
will
not
determine
;
but
so
the
fact
be
.
<EOS>
He
send
for
his
brother
,
and
easily
find
mean
to
introduce
him
at
Allworthy
's
as
a
person
who
intend
only
a
short
visit
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
the
captain
have
not
be
in
the
house
a
week
before
the
doctor
have
reason
to
felicitate
himself
on
his
discernment
.
<EOS>
the
captain
be
indeed
as
great
a
master
of
the
art
of
love
as
Ovid
be
formerly
.
<EOS>
He
have
besides
receive
proper
hint
from
his
brother
,
which
he
fail
not
to
improve
to
the
good
advantage
.
    
<EOS>
contain
many
rule
,
and
some
example
,
concern
fall
in
love
:
description
of
beauty
,
and
other
more
prudential
inducement
to
matrimony
.
 
<EOS>
It
hath
be
observe
,
by
wise
man
or
woman
<EOS>
,
I
forget
which
,
that
all
person
be
doom
to
be
in
love
once
in
their
life
.
<EOS>
no
particular
season
be
,
as
I
remember
,
assign
for
this
;
but
the
age
at
which
Miss
Bridget
be
arrive
,
seem
to
me
as
proper
a
period
as
any
to
be
fix
on
for
this
purpose
:
it
often
,
indeed
,
happen
much
earlier
;
but
when
it
doth
not
,
I
have
observe
it
seldom
or
never
fail
about
this
time
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
we
may
remark
that
at
this
season
love
be
of
a
more
serious
and
steady
nature
than
what
sometimes
show
itself
in
the
young
part
of
life
.
<EOS>
the
love
of
girl
be
uncertain
,
capricious
,
and
so
foolish
that
we
can
not
always
discover
what
the
young
lady
would
be
at
;
nay
,
it
may
almost
be
doubt
whether
she
always
know
this
herself
.
  
<EOS>
now
we
be
never
at
a
loss
to
discern
this
in
woman
about
forty
;
for
as
such
grave
,
serious
,
and
experienced
lady
well
know
their
own
meaning
,
so
it
be
always
very
easy
for
a
man
of
the
least
sagacity
to
discover
it
with
the
utmost
certainty
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Bridget
be
an
example
of
all
these
observation
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
be
many
time
in
the
captain
's
company
before
she
be
seize
with
this
passion
.
<EOS>
nor
do
she
go
pine
and
mope
about
the
house
,
like
a
puny
,
foolish
girl
,
ignorant
of
her
distemper
<EOS>
:
she
feel
,
she
know
,
and
she
enjoy
,
the
pleasing
sensation
,
of
which
,
as
she
be
certain
it
be
not
only
innocent
but
laudable
,
she
be
neither
afraid
nor
ashamed
.
  
<EOS>
and
to
say
the
truth
,
there
be
,
in
all
point
,
great
difference
between
the
reasonable
passion
which
woman
at
this
age
conceive
towards
man
,
and
the
idle
and
childish
liking
of
a
girl
to
a
boy
,
which
be
often
fix
on
the
outside
only
,
and
on
thing
of
little
value
and
no
duration
;
as
on
cherry
-
cheek
,
small
,
lily
-
white
hand
,
sloe
-
black
eye
,
flow
lock
,
downy
chin
,
dapper
shape
;
nay
,
sometimes
on
charm
more
worthless
than
these
,
and
less
the
party
's
own
;
such
be
the
outward
ornament
of
the
person
,
for
which
man
be
behold
to
the
taylor
,
the
laceman
,
the
periwig
-
maker
,
the
hatter
,
and
the
milliner
,
and
not
to
nature
.
<EOS>
such
a
passion
girl
may
well
be
ashamed
,
as
they
generally
be
,
to
own
either
to
themselves
or
other
.
  
<EOS>
the
love
of
Miss
Bridget
be
of
another
kind
.
<EOS>
the
captain
owe
nothing
to
any
of
these
fop
-
maker
in
his
dress
,
nor
be
his
person
much
more
beholden
to
nature
.
<EOS>
both
his
dress
and
person
be
such
as
,
have
they
appear
in
an
assembly
or
a
drawing
-
room
,
would
have
be
the
contempt
and
ridicule
of
all
the
fine
lady
there
.
<EOS>
the
former
of
these
be
indeed
neat
,
but
plain
,
coarse
,
ill
-
fancy
,
and
out
of
fashion
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
latter
,
we
have
expressly
describe
it
above
.
<EOS>
so
far
be
the
skin
on
his
cheek
from
be
cherry
-
colour
,
that
you
could
not
discern
what
the
natural
colour
of
his
cheek
be
,
they
be
totally
overgrow
by
a
black
beard
,
which
ascend
to
his
eye
.
<EOS>
His
shape
and
limb
be
indeed
exactly
proportion
,
but
so
large
that
they
denote
the
strength
rather
of
a
ploughman
than
any
other
.
<EOS>
His
shoulder
be
broad
beyond
all
size
,
and
the
calf
of
his
leg
large
than
those
of
a
common
chairman
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
his
whole
person
want
all
that
elegance
and
beauty
which
be
the
very
reverse
of
clumsy
strength
,
and
which
so
agreeably
set
off
most
of
our
fine
gentleman
;
be
partly
owing
to
the
high
blood
of
their
ancestor
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
blood
make
of
rich
sauce
and
generous
wine
,
and
partly
to
an
early
town
education
.
  
<EOS>
though
Miss
Bridget
be
a
woman
of
the
great
delicacy
of
taste
,
yet
such
be
the
charm
of
the
captain
's
conversation
,
that
she
totally
overlook
the
defect
of
his
person
.
<EOS>
She
imagine
,
and
perhaps
very
wisely
,
that
she
should
enjoy
more
agreeable
minute
with
the
captain
than
with
a
much
pretty
fellow
;
and
forewent
the
consideration
of
please
her
eye
,
in
order
to
procure
herself
much
more
solid
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
the
captain
no
sooner
perceive
the
passion
of
Miss
Bridget
,
in
which
discovery
he
be
very
quick
-
sighted
,
than
he
faithfully
return
it
.
<EOS>
the
lady
,
no
more
than
her
lover
,
be
remarkable
for
beauty
.
<EOS>
I
would
attempt
to
draw
her
picture
,
but
that
be
do
already
by
a
more
able
master
,
Mr
Hogarth
himself
,
to
whom
she
sit
many
year
ago
,
and
hath
be
lately
exhibit
by
that
gentleman
in
his
print
of
a
winter
's
morning
,
of
which
she
be
no
improper
emblem
,
and
may
be
see
walk
(
for
walk
she
doth
in
the
print
)
to
Covent
Garden
church
,
with
a
starve
foot
-
boy
behind
carry
her
prayer
-
book
.
  
<EOS>
the
captain
likewise
very
wisely
prefer
the
more
solid
enjoyment
he
expect
with
this
lady
,
to
the
fleeting
charm
of
person
.
<EOS>
He
be
one
of
those
wise
man
who
regard
beauty
in
the
other
sex
as
a
very
worthless
and
superficial
qualification
;
or
,
to
speak
more
truly
,
who
rather
chuse
to
possess
every
convenience
of
life
with
an
ugly
woman
,
than
a
handsome
one
without
any
of
those
convenience
.
<EOS>
and
have
a
very
good
appetite
,
and
but
little
nicety
,
he
fancy
he
should
play
his
part
very
well
at
the
matrimonial
banquet
,
without
the
sauce
of
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
to
deal
plainly
with
the
reader
,
the
captain
,
ever
since
his
arrival
,
at
least
from
the
moment
his
brother
have
propose
the
match
to
him
,
long
before
he
have
discover
any
flattering
symptom
in
Miss
Bridget
,
have
be
greatly
enamour
;
that
be
to
say
,
of
Mr
Allworthy
's
house
and
garden
,
and
of
his
land
,
tenement
,
and
hereditament
;
of
all
which
the
captain
be
so
passionately
fond
,
that
he
would
most
probably
have
contract
marriage
with
them
,
have
he
be
oblige
to
have
take
the
witch
of
Endor
into
the
bargain
.
  
<EOS>
as
Mr
Allworthy
,
therefore
,
have
declare
to
the
doctor
that
he
never
intend
to
take
a
second
wife
,
as
his
sister
be
his
near
relation
,
and
as
the
doctor
have
fish
out
that
his
intention
be
to
make
any
child
of
hers
his
heir
,
which
indeed
the
law
,
without
his
interposition
,
would
have
do
for
him
;
the
doctor
and
his
brother
think
it
an
act
of
benevolence
to
give
be
to
a
human
creature
,
who
would
be
so
plentifully
provide
with
the
most
essential
mean
of
happiness
.
<EOS>
the
whole
thought
,
therefore
,
of
both
the
brother
be
how
to
engage
the
affection
of
this
amiable
lady
.
  
<EOS>
but
fortune
,
who
be
a
tender
parent
,
and
often
doth
more
for
her
favourite
offspring
than
either
they
deserve
or
wish
,
have
be
so
industrious
for
the
captain
,
that
whilst
he
be
lay
scheme
to
execute
his
purpose
,
the
lady
conceive
the
same
desire
with
himself
,
and
be
on
her
side
contrive
how
to
give
the
captain
proper
encouragement
,
without
appear
too
forward
;
for
she
be
a
strict
observer
of
all
rule
of
decorum
.
<EOS>
in
this
,
however
,
she
easily
succeed
;
for
as
the
captain
be
always
on
the
look
-
out
,
no
glance
,
gesture
,
or
word
escape
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
satisfaction
which
the
captain
receive
from
the
kind
behaviour
of
Miss
Bridget
,
be
not
a
little
abate
by
his
apprehension
of
Mr
Allworthy
;
for
,
notwithstanding
his
disinterested
profession
,
the
captain
imagine
he
would
,
when
he
come
to
act
,
follow
the
example
of
the
rest
of
the
world
,
and
refuse
his
consent
to
a
match
so
disadvantageous
,
in
point
of
interest
,
to
his
sister
.
<EOS>
from
what
oracle
he
receive
this
opinion
,
I
shall
leave
the
reader
to
determine
:
but
however
he
come
by
it
,
it
strangely
perplex
him
how
to
regulate
his
conduct
so
as
at
once
to
convey
his
affection
to
the
lady
,
and
to
conceal
it
from
her
brother
.
<EOS>
He
at
length
resolve
to
take
all
private
opportunity
of
make
his
address
;
but
in
the
presence
of
Mr
Allworthy
to
be
as
reserve
and
as
much
upon
his
guard
as
be
possible
;
and
this
conduct
be
highly
approve
by
the
brother
.
  
<EOS>
He
soon
find
mean
to
make
his
address
,
in
express
term
,
to
his
mistress
,
from
whom
he
receive
an
answer
in
the
proper
form
,
viz
.
<EOS>
:
<EOS>
the
answer
which
be
first
make
some
thousand
of
year
ago
,
and
which
hath
be
hand
down
by
tradition
from
mother
to
daughter
ever
since
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
to
translate
this
into
Latin
,
I
should
render
it
by
these
two
word
,
Nolo
Episcopari
:
a
phrase
likewise
of
immemorial
use
on
another
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
the
captain
,
however
he
come
by
his
knowledge
,
perfectly
well
understand
the
lady
,
and
very
soon
after
repeat
his
application
with
more
warmth
and
earnestness
than
before
,
and
be
again
,
accord
to
due
form
,
reject
;
but
as
he
have
increase
in
the
eagerness
of
his
desire
,
so
the
lady
,
with
the
same
propriety
,
decrease
in
the
violence
of
her
refusal
.
  
<EOS>
not
to
tire
the
reader
,
by
lead
him
through
every
scene
of
this
courtship
(
which
,
though
in
the
opinion
of
a
certain
great
author
,
it
be
the
pleasantest
scene
of
life
to
the
actor
,
be
,
perhaps
,
as
dull
and
tiresome
as
any
whatever
to
the
audience
)
,
the
captain
make
his
advance
in
form
,
the
citadel
be
defend
in
form
,
and
at
length
,
in
proper
form
,
surrender
at
discretion
.
  
<EOS>
during
this
whole
time
,
which
fill
the
space
of
near
a
month
,
the
captain
preserve
great
distance
of
behaviour
to
his
lady
in
the
presence
of
the
brother
;
and
the
more
he
succeed
with
her
in
private
,
<EOS>
the
more
reserved
be
he
in
public
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
the
lady
,
she
have
no
sooner
secure
her
lover
than
she
behave
to
him
before
company
with
the
high
degree
of
indifference
;
so
that
Mr
Allworthy
must
have
have
the
insight
of
the
devil
(
or
perhaps
some
of
his
bad
quality
)
to
have
entertain
the
least
suspicion
of
what
be
go
forward
.
    
<EOS>
contain
what
the
reader
may
,
perhaps
,
expect
to
find
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
bargain
,
whether
to
fight
or
to
marry
,
or
concern
any
other
such
business
,
little
previous
ceremony
be
require
to
bring
the
matter
to
an
issue
when
both
party
be
really
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
case
at
present
,
and
in
less
than
a
month
the
captain
and
his
lady
be
man
and
wife
.
  
<EOS>
the
great
concern
now
be
to
break
the
matter
to
Mr
Allworthy
;
and
this
be
undertake
by
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
,
then
,
as
Allworthy
be
walk
in
his
garden
,
the
doctor
come
to
him
,
and
,
with
great
gravity
of
aspect
,
and
all
the
concern
which
he
could
possibly
affect
in
his
countenance
,
say
,
"
I
be
come
,
sir
,
to
impart
an
affair
to
you
of
the
utmost
consequence
;
but
how
shall
I
mention
to
you
what
it
almost
distract
me
to
think
of
!
"
<EOS>
He
then
launch
forth
into
the
most
bitter
invective
both
against
man
and
woman
;
accuse
the
former
of
have
no
attachment
but
to
their
interest
,
and
the
latter
of
be
so
addicted
to
vicious
inclination
that
they
could
never
be
safely
trust
with
one
of
the
other
sex
.
<EOS>
"
Could
I
,
"
say
he
,
"
sir
,
have
suspect
that
a
lady
of
such
prudence
,
such
judgment
,
such
learning
,
should
indulge
so
indiscreet
a
passion
!
<EOS>
or
could
I
have
imagine
that
my
brother
 
<EOS>
why
do
I
call
him
so
?
<EOS>
he
be
no
longer
a
brother
of
mine
"
  
"
<EOS>
indeed
<EOS>
but
he
be
,
"
say
Allworthy
,
"
and
a
brother
of
mine
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
bless
me
,
sir
!
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
do
you
know
the
shocking
affair
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look'ee
,
Mr
Blifil
,
"
answer
the
good
man
,
<EOS>
"
it
hath
be
my
constant
maxim
in
life
to
make
the
good
of
all
matter
which
happen
.
<EOS>
My
sister
,
though
many
year
young
than
I
,
be
at
least
old
enough
to
be
at
the
age
of
discretion
.
<EOS>
have
he
impose
on
a
child
,
I
should
have
be
more
averse
to
have
forgive
him
;
but
a
woman
upwards
of
thirty
must
certainly
be
suppose
to
know
what
will
make
her
most
happy
.
<EOS>
She
hath
marry
a
gentleman
,
though
perhaps
not
quite
her
equal
in
fortune
;
and
if
he
hath
any
perfection
in
her
eye
which
can
make
up
that
deficiency
,
I
see
no
reason
why
I
should
object
to
her
choice
of
her
own
happiness
;
which
I
,
no
more
than
herself
,
imagine
to
consist
only
in
immense
wealth
.
<EOS>
I
may
,
perhaps
,
from
the
many
declaration
I
have
make
of
comply
with
almost
any
proposal
,
have
expect
to
have
be
consult
on
this
occasion
;
but
these
matter
be
of
a
very
delicate
nature
,
and
the
scruple
of
modesty
,
perhaps
,
be
not
to
be
overcome
.
<EOS>
as
to
your
brother
,
I
have
really
no
anger
against
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
He
hath
no
obligation
to
me
,
nor
do
I
think
he
be
under
any
necessity
of
ask
my
consent
,
since
the
woman
be
,
as
I
have
say
,
sui
juris
,
and
of
a
proper
age
to
be
entirely
answerable
only
,
to
herself
for
her
conduct
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
accuse
Mr
Allworthy
of
too
great
lenity
,
repeat
his
accusation
against
his
brother
,
and
declare
that
he
should
never
more
be
bring
either
to
see
,
or
to
own
him
for
his
relation
.
<EOS>
He
then
launch
forth
into
a
panegyric
on
Allworthy
's
goodness
;
into
the
high
encomium
on
his
friendship
;
and
conclude
by
say
,
he
should
never
forgive
his
brother
for
have
put
the
place
which
he
bear
in
that
friendship
to
a
hazard
.
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
thus
answer
:
"
have
I
conceive
any
displeasure
against
your
brother
<EOS>
,
I
should
never
have
carry
that
resentment
to
the
innocent
:
but
I
assure
you
I
have
no
such
displeasure
.
<EOS>
Your
brother
appear
to
me
to
be
a
man
of
sense
and
honour
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
disapprove
the
taste
of
my
sister
;
nor
will
I
doubt
but
that
she
be
equally
the
object
of
his
inclination
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
think
love
the
only
foundation
of
happiness
in
a
married
state
,
as
it
can
only
produce
that
high
and
tender
friendship
which
should
always
be
the
cement
of
this
union
;
and
,
in
my
opinion
,
all
those
marriage
which
be
contract
from
other
motive
be
greatly
criminal
;
they
be
a
profanation
of
a
most
holy
ceremony
,
and
generally
end
in
disquiet
and
misery
:
for
surely
we
may
call
it
a
profanation
to
convert
this
most
sacred
institution
into
a
wicked
sacrifice
to
lust
or
avarice
:
and
what
well
can
be
say
of
those
match
to
which
man
be
induce
merely
by
the
consideration
of
a
beautiful
person
,
or
a
great
fortune
?
  
<EOS>
"
to
deny
that
beauty
be
an
agreeable
object
to
the
eye
,
and
even
worthy
some
admiration
,
would
be
false
and
foolish
.
<EOS>
beautiful
be
an
epithet
often
use
in
scripture
,
and
always
mention
with
honour
.
<EOS>
It
be
my
own
fortune
to
marry
a
woman
whom
the
world
think
handsome
,
and
I
can
truly
say
I
like
her
the
well
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
but
to
make
this
the
sole
consideration
of
marriage
,
to
lust
after
it
so
violently
as
to
overlook
all
imperfection
for
its
sake
,
or
to
require
it
so
absolutely
as
to
reject
and
disdain
religion
,
virtue
,
and
sense
,
which
be
quality
in
their
nature
of
much
high
perfection
,
only
because
an
elegance
of
person
be
want
:
this
be
surely
inconsistent
,
either
with
a
wise
man
or
a
good
Christian
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
,
perhaps
,
be
too
charitable
to
conclude
that
such
person
mean
anything
more
by
their
marriage
than
to
please
their
carnal
appetite
;
for
the
satisfaction
of
which
,
we
be
teach
,
it
be
not
ordain
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
the
next
place
,
with
respect
to
fortune
.
<EOS>
worldly
prudence
,
perhaps
,
exact
some
consideration
on
this
head
;
nor
will
I
absolutely
and
altogether
condemn
it
.
<EOS>
as
the
world
be
constitute
,
the
demand
of
a
married
state
,
and
the
care
of
posterity
,
require
some
little
regard
to
what
we
call
circumstance
.
<EOS>
yet
this
provision
be
greatly
increase
,
beyond
what
be
really
necessary
,
by
folly
and
vanity
,
which
create
abundantly
more
want
than
nature
.
<EOS>
equipage
for
the
wife
,
and
large
fortune
for
the
child
,
be
by
custom
enrol
in
the
list
of
necessary
;
and
to
procure
these
,
everything
truly
solid
and
sweet
,
and
virtuous
and
religious
,
be
neglect
and
overlook
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
this
in
many
degree
;
the
last
and
great
of
which
seem
scarce
distinguishable
from
madness
;
 
I
mean
where
person
of
immense
fortune
contract
themselves
to
those
who
be
,
and
must
be
,
disagreeable
to
them
 
to
fool
and
knave
 
in
order
to
increase
an
estate
already
large
even
than
the
demand
of
their
pleasure
.
<EOS>
surely
such
person
,
if
they
will
not
be
think
mad
,
must
own
,
either
that
they
be
incapable
of
taste
the
sweet
of
the
tender
friendship
,
or
that
they
sacrifice
the
great
happiness
of
which
they
be
capable
to
the
vain
,
uncertain
,
and
senseless
law
of
vulgar
opinion
,
which
owe
as
well
their
force
as
their
foundation
to
folly
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
Allworthy
conclude
his
sermon
,
to
which
Blifil
have
listen
with
the
profound
attention
,
though
it
cost
him
some
pain
to
prevent
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
small
discomposure
of
his
muscle
.
<EOS>
He
now
praise
every
period
of
what
he
have
hear
with
the
warmth
of
a
young
divine
,
who
hath
the
honour
to
dine
with
a
bishop
the
same
day
in
which
his
lordship
hath
mount
the
pulpit
.
    
<EOS>
which
conclude
the
first
book
;
with
an
instance
of
ingratitude
,
which
,
we
hope
,
will
appear
unnatural
.
 
<EOS>
the
reader
,
from
what
hath
be
say
,
may
imagine
that
the
reconciliation
(
if
indeed
it
could
be
so
call
)
be
only
matter
of
form
;
we
shall
therefore
pass
it
over
,
and
hasten
to
what
must
surely
be
think
matter
of
substance
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
have
acquaint
his
brother
with
what
have
past
between
Mr
Allworthy
and
him
;
and
add
with
a
smile
,
"
I
promise
you
I
pay
you
off
;
nay
,
I
absolutely
desire
the
good
gentleman
not
to
forgive
you
:
for
you
know
after
he
have
make
a
declaration
in
your
favour
,
I
may
with
safety
venture
on
such
a
request
with
a
person
of
his
temper
;
and
I
be
willing
,
as
well
for
your
sake
as
for
my
own
,
to
prevent
the
least
possibility
of
a
suspicion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Captain
Blifil
take
not
the
least
notice
of
this
,
at
that
time
;
but
he
afterwards
make
a
very
notable
use
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
the
maxim
which
the
devil
,
in
a
late
visit
upon
earth
,
leave
to
his
disciple
,
be
,
when
once
you
be
get
up
,
to
kick
the
stool
from
under
you
.
<EOS>
in
plain
English
,
when
you
have
make
your
fortune
by
the
good
office
of
a
friend
,
you
be
advise
to
discard
him
as
soon
as
you
can
.
  
<EOS>
whether
the
captain
act
by
this
maxim
,
I
will
not
positively
determine
:
<EOS>
so
far
we
may
confidently
say
,
that
his
action
may
be
fairly
derive
from
this
diabolical
principle
;
and
indeed
it
be
difficult
to
assign
any
other
motive
to
them
:
for
no
sooner
be
he
possess
of
Miss
Bridget
,
and
reconcile
to
Allworthy
,
than
he
begin
to
show
a
coldness
to
his
brother
which
increase
daily
;
till
at
length
it
grow
into
rudeness
,
and
become
very
visible
to
every
one
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
remonstrate
to
him
privately
concern
this
behaviour
,
but
could
obtain
no
other
satisfaction
than
the
follow
plain
declaration
:
"
if
you
dislike
anything
in
my
brother
's
house
,
sir
,
you
know
you
be
at
liberty
to
quit
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
strange
,
cruel
,
and
almost
unaccountable
ingratitude
in
the
captain
,
absolutely
break
the
poor
doctor
's
heart
;
for
ingratitude
never
so
thoroughly
pierce
the
human
breast
as
when
it
proceed
from
those
in
whose
behalf
we
have
be
guilty
of
transgression
.
<EOS>
reflection
on
great
and
good
action
,
however
they
be
receive
or
return
by
those
in
whose
favour
they
be
perform
,
always
administer
some
comfort
to
us
;
but
what
consolation
shall
we
receive
under
so
bite
a
calamity
as
the
ungrateful
behaviour
of
our
friend
,
when
our
wound
conscience
at
the
same
time
fly
in
our
face
,
and
upbraid
us
with
have
spot
it
in
the
service
of
one
so
worthless
!
  
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
himself
speak
to
the
captain
in
his
brother
's
behalf
,
and
desire
to
know
what
offence
the
doctor
have
commit
;
when
the
hard
-
hearted
villain
have
the
baseness
to
say
that
he
should
never
forgive
him
for
the
injury
which
he
have
endeavour
to
do
him
in
his
favour
;
which
,
he
say
,
he
have
pump
out
of
him
,
and
be
such
a
cruelty
that
it
ought
not
to
be
forgive
.
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
speak
in
very
high
term
upon
this
declaration
,
which
,
he
say
,
become
not
a
human
creature
.
<EOS>
He
express
,
indeed
,
so
much
resentment
against
an
unforgive
temper
,
that
the
captain
at
last
pretend
to
be
convince
by
his
argument
,
and
outwardly
profess
to
be
reconcile
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
the
bride
,
she
be
now
in
her
honeymoon
,
and
so
passionately
fond
of
her
new
husband
that
he
never
appear
to
her
to
be
in
the
wrong
;
and
his
displeasure
against
any
person
be
a
sufficient
reason
for
her
dislike
to
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
the
captain
,
at
Mr
Allworthy
's
instance
,
be
outwardly
,
as
we
have
say
,
reconcile
to
his
brother
;
yet
the
same
rancour
remain
in
his
heart
;
and
he
find
so
many
opportunity
of
give
him
private
hint
of
this
,
that
the
house
at
last
grow
insupportable
to
the
poor
doctor
;
and
he
choose
rather
to
submit
to
any
inconvenience
which
he
may
encounter
in
the
world
,
than
longer
to
bear
these
cruel
and
ungrateful
insult
from
a
brother
for
whom
he
have
do
so
much
.
  
<EOS>
He
once
intend
to
acquaint
Allworthy
with
the
whole
;
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
submit
to
the
confession
,
by
which
he
must
take
to
his
share
so
great
a
portion
of
guilt
.
<EOS>
besides
,
by
how
much
the
bad
man
he
represent
his
brother
to
be
,
so
much
the
great
would
his
own
offence
appear
to
Allworthy
,
and
so
much
the
great
,
he
have
reason
to
imagine
,
would
be
his
resentment
.
  
<EOS>
He
feign
,
therefore
,
some
excuse
of
business
for
his
departure
,
and
promise
to
return
soon
again
;
and
take
leave
of
his
brother
with
so
well
-
dissemble
content
,
that
,
as
the
captain
play
his
part
to
the
same
perfection
,
Allworthy
remain
well
satisfied
with
the
truth
of
the
reconciliation
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
go
directly
to
London
,
where
he
die
soon
after
of
a
broken
heart
;
a
distemper
which
kill
many
more
than
be
generally
imagine
,
and
would
have
a
fair
title
to
a
place
in
the
bill
of
mortality
,
do
it
not
differ
in
one
instance
from
all
other
disease
 
viz
.
,
that
no
physician
can
cure
it
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
upon
the
most
diligent
enquiry
into
the
former
life
of
these
two
brother
,
I
find
,
besides
the
cursed
and
hellish
maxim
of
policy
above
mention
,
<EOS>
another
reason
for
the
captain
's
conduct
:
the
captain
,
besides
what
we
have
before
say
of
him
,
be
a
man
of
great
pride
and
fierceness
,
and
have
always
treat
his
brother
,
who
be
of
a
different
complexion
,
and
greatly
deficient
in
both
these
quality
,
with
the
utmost
air
of
superiority
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
however
,
have
much
the
large
share
of
learning
,
and
be
by
many
repute
to
have
the
well
understanding
.
<EOS>
this
the
captain
know
,
and
could
not
bear
;
for
though
envy
be
at
best
a
very
malignant
passion
,
yet
be
its
bitterness
greatly
heighten
by
mix
with
contempt
towards
the
same
object
;
and
very
much
afraid
I
be
,
that
whenever
an
obligation
be
join
to
these
two
,
indignation
and
not
gratitude
will
be
the
product
of
all
three
.

what

though
we
have
properly
enough
entitle
this
our

,
a
history
,
and
not
a
life
;
nor
an
apology
for

as
be
more
in

yet
we
intend
in
it
rather
to
pursue
the
method
of
those
writer
,
who
profes
to
disclose
the
revolution
of
country
,
than
to
imitate
the
painful

voluminous

who
,
to

the
regularity

think

oblige

as
he
employ
upon
those
notable
aera
when
the
great

have
be
transact

the

<EOS>
such
history
as

do
,
in
reality
,
very
much
resemble
a
newspaper
,
which
consist
of
just
the

number
of

empty

<EOS>
the

seem
to

oblige

like

<EOS>
of
which
we
wish
we
could
give
our
reader
a
more
adequate
translation
than
that
by
Mr
Creech
        
<EOS>
when
dreadful
Carthage
fright
Rome
with
arm
,
     
and
all
the
world
be
shake
with
fierce
alarm
;
     
Whilst
undecide
yet
,
which
part
should
fall
,
     
<EOS>
which
nation
rise
the
glorious
lord
of
all
.
  
<EOS>
now
it
be
our
purpose
,
in
the
ensue
page
,
to
pursue
a
contrary
method
.
<EOS>
when
any
extraordinary
scene
present
itself
(
as
we
trust
will
often
be
the
case
)
,
we
shall
spare
no
pain
nor

to
open
it
at

to
our

but
if
whole
year
should
pass
without
produce
anything
worthy
his
notice
,
we
shall
not
be
afraid
of
a
chasm
in
our
history
;
but
shall
hasten
on
to
matter
of
consequence
,
and
leave
such
period
of
time
totally
unobserved
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
indeed
to
be
consider
as
blank
in
the
grand
lottery
of
time
.
<EOS>
We
therefore
,
who
be
the
register
of
that
lottery
,
shall
imitate
those
sagacious
person
who
deal
in
that
which
be
draw
at
Guildhall
,
and
who
never
trouble
the
public
with
the
many
blank
they
dispose
of
;
but
when
a
great
prize
happen
to
be
draw
,
the
newspaper
be
presently
fill
with
it
,
and
the
world
be
sure
to

inform
at

indeed

commonly
two
or
three
different

lie

the
honour
of

by
which

I
suppose

the

give

of
Fortune

indeed
of

<EOS>
My

then
be
not
to
be
surprize
,
if
,
in
the
course

this

he
shall
find
some
chapter
very
short
,
and
other
altogether
as
long
;
some
that
contain
only
the
time
of
a
single
day
,
and
other
that
comprise

in
a
word

if
my

seem
to

religious

eight

Miss

deliver

<EOS>
the

be
indeed
to
all
appearance
perfect
;
but
the
midwife
discover
it
be
bear
a
month
before
its
full
time
.
  
<EOS>
though
the
birth
of
an
heir
by
his
beloved
sister
be
a
circumstance
of
great
joy
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
yet
it
do
not
alienate
his
affection
from
the
little
foundling
,
to
whom
he
have
be
godfather
,
have
give
his
own
name
of
Thomas
,
and
whom
he
have
hitherto
seldom
fail
of
visit
,
at
least
once
a
day
,
in
his
nursery
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
his
sister
,
if
she
please
,
the
new
-
bear
infant
should
be
breed
up
together
with
little
Tommy
;
to
which
she
consent
,
though
with
some
little
reluctance
:
for
she
have
truly
a
great
complacence
for
her
brother
;
and
hence
she
have
always
behave
towards
the
foundle
with
rather
more
kindness
than
lady
of
rigid
virtue
can
sometimes
bring
themselves
to
show
to
these
child
,
who
,
however
innocent
,
may
be
truly
call
the
live
monument
of
incontinence

<EOS>
the
captain
could
not
so
easily
bring
himself
to
bear
what
he
condemn
as
a
fault
in
Mr
Allworthy
.
<EOS>
He
give
him
frequent
hint
,
that
to
adopt
the
fruit
of
sin
,
be
to
give
countenance
to
it
.
<EOS>
He
quote
several
text
(
for
he
be
well
read
in
scripture
)
,
<EOS>
such
as
,
He
visit
the
sin
of
the
father
upon
the
child
;
and
the
father
have
eat
sour
grape
,
and
the
child
's
tooth
be
set
on
edge,&c
.
<EOS>
whence
he
argue
the
legality
of
punish
the
crime
of
the
parent
on
the
bastard
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
though
the
law
do
not
positively
allow
the
destroy
such
base
-
bear
child
,
yet
it
hold
them
to
be
the
child
of
nobody
;
that
the
Church
consider
them
as
the
child
of
nobody
;
and
that
at
the
good
,
they
ought
to
be
bring
up
to
the
low
and
vilest
office
of
the
commonwealth
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
answer
to
all
this
,
and
much
more
,
which
the
captain
have
urge
on
this
subject
,
"
that
,
however
guilty
the
parent
may
be
,
the
child
be
certainly
innocent
:
that
as
to
the
text
he
have
quote
,
the
former
of
them
be
a
particular
denunciation
against
the
Jews
,
for
the
sin
of
idolatry
,
of
relinquish
and
hate
their
heavenly
King
;
and
the
latter
be
parabolically
speak
,
and
rather
intend
to
denote
the
certain
and
necessary
consequence
of
sin
,
than
any
express
judgment
against
it
.
<EOS>
but
to
represent
the
Almighty
as
avenge
the
sin
of
the
guilty
on
the
innocent
,
be
indecent
,
if
not
blasphemous
,
as
it
be
to
represent
him
act
against
the
first
principle
of
natural
justice
,
and
against
the
original
notion
of
right
and
wrong
,
which
he
himself
have
implant
in
our
mind
;
by
which
we
be
to
judge
not
only
in
all
matter
which
be
not
reveal
,
but
even
of
the
truth
of
revelation
itself
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
know
many
hold
the
same
principle
with
the
captain
on
this
head
;
but
he
be
himself
firmly
convinced
to
the
contrary
,
and
would
provide
in
the
same
manner
for
this
poor
infant
,
as
if
a
legitimate
child
have
have
fortune
to
have
be
find
in
the
same
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
while
the
captain
be
take
all
opportunity
to
press
these
and
such
like
argument
,
to
remove
the
little
foundle
from
Mr
Allworthy
's
,
of
whose
fondness
for
him
he
begin
to
be
jealous
,
Mrs
Deborah
have
make
a
discovery
,
which
,
in
its
event
,
threaten
at
least
to
prove
more
fatal
to
poor
Tommy
than
all
the
reasoning
of
the
captain
.
  
<EOS>
whether
the
insatiable
curiosity
of
this
good
woman
have
carry
her
on
to
that
business
,
or
whether
she
do
it
to
confirm
herself
in
the
good
grace
of
Mrs
Blifil
,
who
,
notwithstanding
her
outward
behaviour
to
the
foundling
,
frequently
abuse
the
infant
in
private
,
and
her
brother
too
,
for
his
fondness
to
it
,
I
will
not
determine
;
but
she
have
now
,
as
she
conceive
,
fully
detect
the
father
of
the
foundling
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
as
this
be
a
discovery
of
great
consequence
,
it
may
be
necessary
to
trace
it
from
the
fountain
-
head
.
<EOS>
We
shall
therefore
very
minutely
lie
open
those
previous
matter
by
which
it
be
produce
;
and
for
that
purpose
we
shall
be
oblige
to
reveal
all
the
secret
of
a
little
family
with
which
my
reader
be
at
present
entirely
unacquainted
;
and
of
which
the
oeconomy
be
so
rare
and
extraordinary
,
that
I
fear
it
will
shock
the
utmost
credulity
of
many
married
person
.
    
<EOS>
the
description
of
a
domestic
government
found
upon
rule
directly
contrary
to
those
of
Aristotle
.
 
<EOS>
My
reader
may
please
to
remember
he
hath
be
inform
that
Jenny
Jones
have
live
some
year
with
a
certain
schoolmaster
,
who
have
,
at
her
earnest
desire
,
instruct
her
in
Latin
,
in
which
,
to
do
justice
to
her
genius
,
she
have
so
improve
herself
,
that
she
be
become
a
well
scholar
than
her
master
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
though
this
poor
man
have
undertake
a
profession
to
which
learning
must
be
allow
necessary
,
this
be
the
least
of
his
commendation
.
<EOS>
He
be
one
of
the
best
-
natured
fellow
in
the
world
,
and
be
,
at
the
same
time
,
master
of
so
much
pleasantry
and
humour
,
that
he
be
repute
the
wit
of
the
country
;
and
all
the
neighbouring
gentleman
be
so
desirous
of
his
company
,
that
as
deny
be
not
his
talent
,
he
spend
much
time
at
their
house
,
which
he
may
,
with
more
emolument
,
have
spend
in
his
school
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
imagine
that
a
gentleman
so
qualified
and
so
disposed
,
be
in
no
danger
of
become
formidable
to
the
learned
seminary
of
Eton
or
Westminster
.
<EOS>
to
speak
plainly
,
his
scholar
be
divide
into
two
class
:
in
the
upper
of
which
be
a
young
gentleman
,
the
son
of
a
neighbouring
squire
,
who
,
at
the
age
of
seventeen
,
be
just
enter
into
his
Syntaxis
;
and
in
the
low
be
a
second
son
of
the
same
gentleman
,
who
,
together
with
seven
parish
-
boy
,
be
learn
to
read
and
write
.
  
<EOS>
the
stipend
arise
hence
would
hardly
have
indulge
the
schoolmaster
in
the
luxury
of
life
,
have
he
not
add
to
this
office
those
of
clerk
and
barber
,
and
have
not
Mr
Allworthy
add
to
the
whole
an
annuity
of
ten
pound
,
which
the
poor
man
receive
every
Christmas
,
and
with
which
he
be
enable
to
cheer
his
heart
during
that
sacred
festival
.
  
<EOS>
among
his
other
treasure
,
the
pedagogue
have
a
wife
,
whom
he
have
marry
out
of
Mr
Allworthy
's
kitchen
for
her
fortune
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
twenty
pound
,
which
she
have
there
amass
.
  
<EOS>
this
woman
be
not
very
amiable
in
her
person
.
<EOS>
whether
she
sit
to
my
friend
Hogarth
,
or
no
,
I
will
not
determine
;
but
she
exactly
resemble
the
young
woman
who
be
pour
out
her
mistress
's
tea
in
the
third
picture
of
the
Harlot
's
Progress
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
besides
,
a
profest
follower
of
that
noble
sect
found
by
Xantippe
of
old
;
by
mean
of
which
she
become
more
formidable
in
the
school
than
her
husband
;
for
,
to
confess
the
truth
,
he
be
never
master
there
,
or
anywhere
else
,
in
her
presence
.
  
<EOS>
though
her
countenance
do
not
denote
much
natural
sweetness
of
temper
,
yet
this
be
,
perhaps
,
somewhat
sour
by
a
circumstance
which
generally
poison
matrimonial
felicity
;
for
child
be
rightly
call
the
pledge
of
love
;
and
her
husband
,
though
they
have
be
marry
nine
year
,
have
give
her
no
such
pledge
;
a
default
for
which
he
have
no
excuse
,
either
from
age
or
health
,
be
not
yet
thirty
year
old
,
and
what
they
call
a
jolly
brisk
young
man
.
  
<EOS>
hence
arise
another
evil
,
which
produce
no
little
uneasiness
to
the
poor
pedagogue
,
of
whom
she
maintain
so
constant
a
jealousy
,
that
he
durst
hardly
speak
to
one
woman
in
the
parish
;
for
the
least
degree
of
civility
,
or
even
correspondence
,
with
any
female
,
be
sure
to
bring
his
wife
upon
her
back
,
and
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
in
order
to
guard
herself
against
matrimonial
injury
in
her
own
house
,
as
she
keep
one
maid
-
servant
,
she
always
take
care
to
chuse
her
out
of
that
order
of
female
whose
face
be
take
as
a
kind
of
security
for
their
virtue
;
of
which
number
Jenny
Jones
,
as
the
reader
hath
be
before
inform
,
be
one
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
face
of
this
young
woman
may
be
call
pretty
good
security
of
the
before
-
mention
kind
,
and
as
her
behaviour
have
be
always
extremely
modest
,
which
be
the
certain
consequence
of
understanding
in
woman
;
she
have
pass
above
four
year
at
Mr
Partridge
's
(
for
that
be
the
schoolmaster
's
name
)
without
create
the
least
suspicion
in
her
mistress
.
<EOS>
nay
,
she
have
be
treat
with
uncommon
kindness
,
and
her
mistress
have
permit
Mr
Partridge
to
give
her
those
instruction
which
have
be
before
commemorate
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
with
jealousy
as
with
the
gout
:
when
such
distemper
be
in
the
blood
,
there
be
never
any
security
against
their
breaking
out
;
and
that
often
on
the
slight
occasion
,
and
when
least
suspect
.
  
<EOS>
thus
it
happen
to
Mrs
Partridge
,
who
have
submit
four
year
to
her
husband
's
teaching
this
young
woman
,
and
have
suffer
her
often
to
neglect
her
work
,
in
order
to
pursue
her
learning
.
<EOS>
for
,
pass
by
one
day
,
as
the
girl
be
read
,
and
her
master
lean
over
her
,
the
girl
,
I
know
not
for
what
reason
,
suddenly
start
up
from
her
chair
:
and
this
be
the
first
time
that
suspicion
ever
enter
into
the
head
of
her
mistress
.
<EOS>
this
do
not
,
however
,
at
that
time
discover
itself
,
but
lie
lurk
in
her
mind
,
like
a
conceal
enemy
,
who
wait
for
a
reinforcement
of
additional
strength
before
he
openly
declare
himself
and
proceed
upon
hostile
operation
:
and
such
additional
strength
soon
arrive
to
corroborate
her
suspicion
;
for
not
long
after
,
the
husband
and
wife
be
at
dinner
,
the
master
say
to
his
maid
,
Da
mihi
aliquid
potum
:
upon
which
the
poor
girl
smile
,
perhaps
at
the
badness
of
the
Latin
,
and
,
when
her
mistress
cast
her
eye
on
her
,
blush
,
possibly
with
a
consciousness
of
have
laugh
at
her
master
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Partridge
,
upon
this
,
immediately
fall
into
a
fury
,
and
discharge
the
trencher
on
which
she
be
eat
,
at
the
head
of
poor
Jenny
,
cry
out
,
"
You
impudent
whore
,
do
you
play
trick
with
my
husband
before
my
face
?
"
and
at
the
same
instant
rise
from
her
chair
with
a
knife
in
her
hand
,
with
which
,
most
probably
,
she
would
have
execute
very
tragical
vengeance
,
have
not
the
girl
take
the
advantage
of
be
nearer
the
door
than
her
mistress
,
and
avoid
her
fury
by
run
away
:
for
,
as
to
the
poor
husband
,
whether
surprize
have
render
him
motionless
,
or
fear
(
which
be
full
as
probable
)
have
restrain
him
from
venture
at
any
opposition
,
he
sit
stare
and
tremble
in
his
chair
;
nor
do
he
once
offer
to
move
or
speak
,
till
his
wife
,
return
from
the
pursuit
of
Jenny
,
make
some
defensive
measure
necessary
for
his
own
preservation
;
and
he
likewise
be
oblige
to
retreat
,
after
the
example
of
the
maid
.
  
<EOS>
this
good
woman
be
,
no
more
than
Othello
,
of
a
disposition
              
<EOS>
to
make
a
life
of
jealousy
     
and
follow
still
the
change
of
the
moon
     
with
fresh
suspicion
   
with
her
,
as
well
as
him
,
              
t
o
be
once
in
doubt
,
     
<EOS>
be
once
to
be
resolvd
   
<EOS>
she
therefore
order
Jenny
immediately
to
pack
up
her
all
and
begone
,
for
that
she
be
determine
she
should
not
sleep
that
night
within
her
wall
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Partridge
have
profit
too
much
by
experience
to
interpose
in
a
matter
of
this
nature
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
have
recourse
to
his
usual
receipt
of
patience
,
for
,
though
he
be
not
a
great
adept
in
Latin
,
he
remember
,
and
well
understand
,
<EOS>
the
advice
contain
in
these
word
   
leve
fit
quod
bene
<EOS>
fertur
onus
  
in
English
:
       
<EOS>
a
burden
become
light
when
it
be
well
borne
   
<EOS>
which
he
have
always
in
his
mouth
;
and
of
which
,
to
say
the
truth
,
he
have
often
occasion
to
experience
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
Jenny
offer
to
make
protestation
of
her
innocence
;
but
the
temp
be
too
strong
for
her
to
be
hear
.
<EOS>
She
then
betook
herself
to
the
business
of
packing
,
for
which
a
small
quantity
of
brown
paper
suffice
,
and
,
have
receive
her
small
pittance
of
wage
,

<EOS>
the
schoolmaster
and
his
consort
pass
their
time
unpleasantly
enough
that
evening
,
but
something
or
other
happen
before
the
next
morning
,
which
a
little
abate
the
fury
of
Mrs
Partridge
;
and
she
at
length
admit
her
husband
to
make
his
excuse
:
to
which
she
give
the
ready
belief
,
as
he
have
,
instead
of
desire
her
to
recall
Jenny
,
profess
a
satisfaction
in
her
be
dismiss
,
say
,
she
be
grow
of
little
use
as
a
servant
,
spend
all
her
time
in
reading
,
and
be
become
,
moreover
,
very
pert
and
obstinate
;
for
,
indeed
,
she
and
her
master
have
lately
have
frequent
dispute
in
literature
;
in
which
,
as
hath
be
say
,
she
be
become
greatly
his
superior
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
he
would
by
no
means
allow
;
and
as
he
call
her
persisting
in
the
right
,
obstinacy
,
he
begin
to
hate
her
with
no
small
inveteracy
.
    
<EOS>
contain
one
of
the
most
bloody
battle
,
or
rather
duel
,
that
be
ever
record
in
domestic
history
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
reason
mention
in
the
precede
chapter
,
and
from
some
other
matrimonial
concession
,
well
known
to
most
husband
,
and
which
,
like
the
secret
of
freemasonry
,
should
be
divulge
to
none
who
be
not
member
of
that
honourable
fraternity
,
Mrs
Partridge
be
pretty
well
satisfied
that
she
have
condemn
her
husband
without
cause
,
and
endeavour
by
act
of
kindness
to
make
him
amend
for
her
false
suspicion
.
<EOS>
Her
passion
be
indeed
equally
violent
,
whichever
way
they
incline
;
for
as
she
could
be
extremely
angry
,
so
could
she
be
altogether
as
fond
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
these
passion
ordinarily
succeed
each
other
,
and
scarce
twenty
-
four
hour
ever
pass
in
which
the
pedagogue
be
not
,
in
some
degree
,
the
object
of
both
;
yet
,
on
extraordinary
occasion
,
when
the
passion
of
anger
have
rage
very
high
,
the
remission
be
usually
longer
:
and
so
be
the
case
at
present
;
for
she
continue
longer
in
a
state
of
affability
,
after
this
fit
of
jealousy
be
end
,
than
her
husband
have
ever
know
before
:
and
,
have
it
not
be
for
some
little
exercise
,
which
all
the
follower
of
Xantippe
be
oblige
to
perform
daily
,
Mr
Partridge
would
have
enjoy
a
perfect
serenity
of
several
month
.
  
<EOS>
perfect
calm
at
sea
be
always
suspect
by
the
experienced
mariner
to
be
the
forerunner
of
a
storm
,
and
I
know
some
person
,
who
,
without
be
generally
the
devotee
of
superstition
,
be
apt
to
apprehend
that
great
and
unusual
peace
or
tranquillity
will
be
attend
with
its
opposite
.
<EOS>
for
which
reason
the
antient
use
,
on
such
occasion
,
to
sacrifice
to
the
goddess
Nemesis
,
a
deity
who
be
think
by
them
to
look
with
an
invidious
eye
on
human
felicity
,
and
to
have
a
peculiar
delight
in
overturn
it
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
be
very
far
from
believe
in
any
such
heathen
goddess
,
or
from
encourage
any
superstition
,
so
we
wish
Mr
John
Fr

or
some
other
such
philosopher
,
would
bestir
himself
a
little
,
in
order
to
find
out
the
real
cause
of
this
sudden
transition
from
good
to
bad
fortune
,
which
hath
be
so
often
remark
,
and
of
which
we
shall
proceed
to
give
an
instance
;
for
it
be
our
province
to
relate
fact
,
and
we
shall
leave
cause
to
person
of
much
high
genius
.
  
<EOS>
mankind
have
always
take
great
delight
in
know
and
descant
on
the
action
of
other

<EOS>
hence
there
have
be
,
in
all
age
and
nation
,
certain
place
set
apart
for
public
rendezvous
,
where
the
curious
may
meet
and
satisfy
their
mutual
curiosity
.
<EOS>
among
these
,
the
barber
'
shop
have
justly
bear
the
pre

eminence
.
<EOS>
among
the
Greeks
,
barber
'
news
be
a
proverbial
expression
;
and
Horace
,
in
one
of
his
epistle
,
make
honourable
mention
of
the
roman
barber
in
the
same
light
.
  
<EOS>
those
of
England
be
know
to
be
no
wise
inferior
to
their
greek
or
roman
predecessor
.
<EOS>
You
there
see
foreign
affair
discuss
in
a
manner
little
inferior
to
that
with
which
they
be
handle
in
the
coffee
-
house
;
and
domestic
occurrence
be
much
more
largely
and
freely
treat
in
the
former
than
in
the
latter
.
<EOS>
but
this
serve
only
for
the
man
.
<EOS>
now
,
whereas
the
female
of
this
country
,
especially
those
of
the
low
order
,
do
associate
themselves
much
more
than
those
of
other
nation
,
our
polity
would
be
highly
deficient
,
if
they
have
not
some
place
set
apart
likewise
for
the
indulgence
of
their
curiosity
,
see
they
be
in
this
no
way
inferior
to
the
other
half
of
the
specie
.
  
<EOS>
in
enjoy
,
therefore
,
such
place
of
rendezvous
,
the
british
fair
ought
to
esteem
themselves
more
happy
than
any
of
their
foreign
sister

as
I
do
not
remember
either
to
have
read
in
history
,
or
to
have
see
in
my
travel
,
anything
of
the
like
kind
.
  
<EOS>
this
place
then
be
no
other
than
the
chandler

shop
,
the
know
seat
of
all
the
news

or
,
as
it
be
vulgarly
call

gossiping

in
every

<EOS>
Mrs

be
one
day
at
this
assembly
of
female

be
ask
by

if
she
have
hear
no

lately
of
Jenny

<EOS>
to
which
she
answer
in

negative

<EOS>
upon
this
the

with
a
smile
,
that
the
parish
be
very
much
oblige
to
her
for
have
turn
Jenny
away
as
she
do

<EOS>
Mrs
Partridge
,
whose
jealousy
,
as
the
reader
well
know
,
be
long
since
cure
,
and
who
have
no
other
quarrel
to
her
maid
,
answer
boldly
,
She
do
not
know
any
obligation
the
parish
have
to
her
on
that
account
;
for
she
believe
Jenny
have
scarce
leave
her
equal
behind
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
no

truly

say
the

"
<EOS>
I
hope
not
,
though
I
fancy
<EOS>
we
have
slut
enow
too

<EOS>
then
you
have
not
hear
,
it
seem
,
that
she
hath
be
bring
to
bed
of
two
bastard
?
<EOS>
but
as
they
be
not
bear
here
,
my
husband
and
the
other
overseer
say
we
shall
not
be
oblige
to
keep
them

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
two
bastard

"
answer
Mrs
Partridge
hastily
:
"
you
surprize
me
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
we
must
keep
them
;
but
I
be
sure
they
must
have
be
begotten
here
,
for
<EOS>
the
wench
hath
not
be
nine
month
go
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
nothing
can
be
so
quick
and
sudden
as
the
operation
of
the
mind
,
especially
when
hope
,
or
fear
,
or
jealousy
,
to
which
the
two
other
be
but
journeyman
,
set
it
to
work
.
<EOS>
It
occur
instantly
to
her
,
that
Jenny
have
scarce
ever
be
out
of
her
own
house
while
she
live
with
her
.
<EOS>
the
leaning
over
the
chair
,
the
sudden
starting
up
,
the
Latin
,
the
smile
,
and
many
other
thing
,
rush
upon
her
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
the
satisfaction
her
husband
express
in
the
departure
of
Jenny
,
appear
now
to
be
only
dissemble
;
again
,
in
the
same
instant
,
to
be
real
;
but
yet
to
confirm
her
jealousy
,
proceed
from
satiety
,
and
a
hundred
other
bad
cause
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
she
be
convince
of
her
husband
's
guilt
,
and
immediately
leave
the
assembly
in
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
as
fair
Grimalkin
,
who
,
though
the
young
of
the
feline
family
,
degenerate
not
in
ferocity
from
the
eld
branch
of
her
house
,
and
though
inferior
in
strength
,
be
equal
in
fierceness
to
the
noble
tiger
himself

when
a
little
mouse

whom
it
hath
long
torment
in
sport
,
escape
from
her
clutch
for
a
while
,
fret
,
scold

growl

swear

but
if
the
trunk

or
box
,
behind
which
the
mouse
lie
hide
be
again
remove

she
fly
like
lightne

her
prey
,
and
,
with
envenomed
wrath
,
bite
,
scratch
,
mumble
,
and
tear
the
little
animal

<EOS>
not
with
less
fury
do
Mrs
Partridge
fly
on
the
poor
pedagogue
.
<EOS>
Her
tongue
,
tooth
,
and
hand
,
fall
all
upon
him
at
once
.
<EOS>
His
wig
be
in
an
instant
tear
from
his
head
,
his
shirt
from
his
back
,
and
from
his
face
descend
five
stream
of
blood
,
denote
the
number
of
claws
with
which
nature
have
unhappily
arm
the
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Partridge
act
for
some
time
on
the
defensive
only
;
indeed
he
attempt
only
to
guard
his
face
with
his
hand
;
but
as
he
find
that
his
antagonist
abate
nothing
of
her
rage
,
he
think
he
may
,
at
least
,
endeavour
to
disarm
her
,
or
rather
to
confine
her
arm
;
in
do
which
her
cap
fall
off
in
the
struggle
,
and
her
hair
be
too
short
to
reach
her
shoulder
,
erect
itself
on
her
head
;
her
stay
likewise
,
which
be
lace
through
one
single
hole
at
the
bottom
,
burst
open
;
and
her
breast
,
which
be
much
more
redundant
than
her
hair
,
hang
down
below
her
middle
;
her
face
be
likewise
mark
with
the
blood
of
her
husband
:
her
tooth
gnash
with
rage
;
and
fire
,
such
as
sparkle
from
a
smith
's
forge
,
dart
from
her
eye
.
<EOS>
so
that
,
altogether
,
this
amazonian
heroine
may
have
be
an
object
of
terror
to
a
much
bold
man
than
Mr
Partridge
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
,
at
length
,
the
good
fortune
,
by
get
possession
of
her
arm
,
to
render
those
weapon
which
she
wear
at
the
end
of
her
finger
useless
;
which
she
no
sooner
perceive
,
than
the
softness
of
her
sex
prevail
over
her
rage
,
and
she
presently
dissolve
in
tear
,
which
soon
after
conclude
in
a
fit
.
  
<EOS>
that
small
share
of
sense
which
Mr
Partridge
have
hitherto
preserve
through
this
scene
of
fury
,
of
the
cause
of
which
he
be
hitherto
ignorant
,
now
utterly
abandon
him
.
<EOS>
He
run
instantly
into
the
street
,
hallow
out
that
his
wife
be
in
the
agony
of
death
,
and
beseech
the
neighbour
to
fly
with
the
utmost
haste
to
her
assistance
.
<EOS>
several
good
woman
obey
his
summon
,
who
enter
his
house
,
and
apply
the
usual
remedy
on
such
occasion
,
Mrs
Partridge
be
at
length
,
to
the
great
joy
of
her
husband
,
bring
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
have
a
little
recollected
her
spirit
,
and
somewhat
compose
herself
with
a
cordial
,
she
begin
to
inform
the
company
of
the
manifold
injury
she
have
receive
from
her
husband
;
who
,
she
say
,
be
not
content
to
injure
her
in
her
bed
;
but
,
upon
her
upbraid
him
with
it
,
have
treat
her
in
the
cruel
manner
imaginable
;
have
tear
her
cap
and
hair
from
her
head
,
and
her
stay
from
her
body
,
give
her
,
at
the
same
time
,
several
blow
,
the
mark
of
which
she
should
carry
to
the
grave
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
man
,
who
bear
on
his
face
many
more
visible
mark
of
the
indignation
of
his
wife
,
stand
in
silent
astonishment
at
this
accusation
;
which
the
reader
will
,
I
believe
,
bear
witness
for
him
,
have
greatly
exceed
the
truth
;
for
indeed
he
have
not
strike
her
once
;
and
this
silence
be
interpret
to
be
a
confession
of
the
charge
by
the
whole
court
,
they
all
begin
at
once
,
una
voce
,
to
rebuke
and
revile
him
,
repeat
often
,
that
none
but
a
coward
ever
strike
a
woman
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Partridge
bear
all
this
patiently
;
but
when
his
wife
appeal
to
the
blood
on
her
face
,
as
an
evidence
of
his
barbarity
,
he
could
not
help
lay
claim
to
his
own
blood
,
for
so
it
really
be
;
as
he
think
it
very
unnatural
,
that
this
should
rise
up
(
as
we
be
teach
that
of
a
murder
person
often
doth
)
in
vengeance
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
the
woman
make
no
other
answer
,
than
that
it
be
a
pity
it
have
not
come
from
his
heart
,
instead
of
his
face
;
all
declare
,
that
,
if
their
husband
should
lift
their
hand
against
them
,
they
would
have
their
heart
'
blood
out
of
their
body
.
  
<EOS>
after
much
admonition
for
what
be
past
,
and
much
good
advice
to
Mr
Partridge
for
his
future
behaviour
,
the
company
at
length
depart
,
and
leave
the
husband
and
wife
to
a
personal
conference
together
,
in
which
Mr
Partridge
soon
learn
the
cause
of
all
his
suffering
.
    
<EOS>
contain
much
matter
to
exercise
the
judgment
and
reflection
of
the
reader
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
it
be
a
true
observation
,
that
few
secret
be
divulge
to
one
person
only
;
but
certainly
,
it
would
be
next
to
a
miracle
that
a
fact
of
this
kind
should
be
know
to
a
whole
parish
,
and
not
transpire
any
farther
.
  
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
a
very
few
day
have
past
,
before
the
country
,
to
use
a
common
phrase
,
rung
of
the
schoolmaster
of
Little
Baddington
;
who
be
say
to
have
beat
his
wife
in
the
most
cruel
manner
.
<EOS>
nay
,
in
some
place
it
be
report
he
have
murder
her
;
in
other
,
that
he
have
break
her
arm
;
in
other
,
her
leg
:
in
short
,
there
be
scarce
an
injury
which
can
be
do
to
a
human
creature
,
but
what
Mrs
Partridge
be
somewhere
or
other
affirm
to
have
receive
from
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
the
cause
of
this
quarrel
be
likewise
variously
report
;
for
as
some
people
say
that
Mrs
Partridge
have
catch
her
husband
in
bed
with
his
maid
,
so
many
other
reason
,
of
a
very
different
kind
,
go
abroad
.
<EOS>
nay
,
some
transfer
the
guilt
to
the
wife
,
and
the
jealousy
to
the
husband
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Wilkins
have
long
ago
hear
of
this
quarrel
;
but
,
as
a
different
cause
from
the
true
one
have
reach
her
ear
,
she
think
proper
to
conceal
it
;
and
the
rather
,
perhaps
,
as
the
blame
be
universally
lay
on
Mr
Partridge
;
and
his
wife
,
when
she
be
servant
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
have
in
something
offend
Mrs
Wilkins
,
who
be
not
of
a
very
forgiving
temper
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mrs
Wilkins
,
whose
eye
could
see
object
at
a
distance
,
and
who
could
very
well
look
forward
a
few
year
into
futurity
,
have
perceive
a
strong
likelihood
of
Captain
Blifil
's
be
hereafter
her
master
;
and
<EOS>
as
she
plainly
discern
that
the
captain
bear
no
great
goodwill
to
the
little
foundling
,
she
fancy
it
would
be
render
him
an
agreeable
service
,
if
she
could
make
any
discovery
that
may
lessen
the
affection
which
Mr
Allworthy
seem
to
have
contract
for
this
child
,
and
which
give
visible
uneasiness
to
the
captain
,
who
could
not
entirely
conceal
it
even
before
Allworthy
himself
;
though
his
wife
,
who
act
her
part
much
better
in
public
,
frequently
recommend
to
him
her
own
example
,
of
connive
at
the
folly
of
her
brother
,
which
,
she
say
,
she
at
least
as
well
perceive
,
and
as
much
resent
,
as
any
other
possibly
could
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Wilkins
have
therefore
,
by
accident
,
get
a
true
scent
of
the
above
story
,
 
though
long
after
it
have
happen
,
fail
not
to
satisfy
herself
thoroughly
of
all
the
particular
;
and
then
acquaint
the
captain
,
that
she
have
at
last
discover
the
true
father
of
the
little
bastard
,
which
she
be
sorry
,
she
say
,
to
see
her
master
lose
his
reputation
in
the
country
,
by
take
so
much
notice
of
.
  
<EOS>
the
captain
chid
her
for
the
conclusion
of
her
speech
,
as
an
improper
assurance
in
judging
of
her
master
's
action
:
for
if
his
honour
,
or
his
understanding
,
would
have
suffer
the
captain
to
make
an
alliance
with
Mrs
Wilkins
,
his
pride
would
by
no
means
have
admit
it
.
<EOS>
and
to
say
the
truth
,
there
be
no
conduct
less
politic
,
than
to
enter
into
any
confederacy
with
your
friend
's
servant
against
their
master
:
for
by
these
mean
you
afterwards
become
the
slave
of
these
very
servant
;
by
whom
you
be
constantly
liable
to
be
betray
.
<EOS>
and
this
consideration
,
perhaps
it
be
,
which
prevent
Captain
Blifil
from
be
more
explicit
with
Mrs
Wilkins
,
or
from
encourage
the
abuse
which
she
have
bestow
on
Allworthy
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
he
declare
no
satisfaction
to
Mrs
Wilkins
at
this
discovery
,
he
enjoy
not
a
little
from
it
in
his
own
mind
,
and
resolve
to
make
the
good
use
of
it
he
be
able
.
  
<EOS>
He
keep
this
matter
a
long
time
conceal
within
his
own
breast
,
in
hope
that
Mr
Allworthy
may
hear
it
from
some
other
person
;
but
Mrs
Wilkins
,
whether
she
resent
the
captain
's
behaviour
,
or
whether
his
cunning
be
beyond
her
,
and
she
fear
the
discovery
may
displease
him
,
never
afterwards
open
her
lip
about
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
think
it
somewhat
strange
,
upon
reflection
,
that
the
housekeeper
never
acquaint
Mrs
Blifil
with
this
news
,
as
woman
be
more
inclined
to
communicate
all
piece
of
intelligence
to
their
own
sex
,
than
to
ours
.
<EOS>
the
only
way
,
as
it
appear
to
me
,
of
solve
this
difficulty
,
be
,
by
impute
it
to
that
distance
which
be
now
grow
between
the
lady
and
the
housekeeper
:
<EOS>
whether
this
arise
from
a
jealousy
in
Mrs
Blifil
,
that
Wilkins
show
too
great
a
respect
to
the
foundling
;
for
while
she
be
endeavour
to
ruin
the
little
infant
,
in
order
to
ingratiate
herself
with
the
captain
,
she
be
every
day
more
and
more
commend
it
before
Allworthy
,
as
his
fondness
for
it
every
day
increase
.
<EOS>
this
,
notwithstanding
all
the
care
she
take
at
other
time
to
express
the
direct
contrary
to
Mrs
Blifil
,
perhaps
offend
that
delicate
lady
,
who
certainly
now
hate
Mrs
Wilkins
;
and
though
she
do
not
,
or
possibly
could
not
,
absolutely
remove
her
from
her
place
,
she
find
,
however
,
the
mean
of
make
her
life
very
uneasy
.
<EOS>
this
Mrs
Wilkins
,
at
length
,
so
resent
,
that
she
very
openly
show
all
manner
of
respect
and
fondness
to
little
Tommy
,
in
opposition
to
Mrs
Blifil
.
  
<EOS>
the
captain
,
therefore
,
find
the
story
in
danger
of
perish
,
at
last
take
an
opportunity
to
reveal
it
himself
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
one
day
engage
with
Mr
Allworthy
in
a
discourse
on
charity
:
in
which
the
captain
,
with
great
learning
,
prove
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
that
the
word
charity
in
scripture
nowhere
mean
beneficence
or
generosity
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
christian
religion
,
"
he
say
,
"
be
institute
for
much
noble
purpose
,
than
to
enforce
a
lesson
which
many
heathen
philosopher
have
teach
us
long
before
,
and
which
,
though
it
may
perhaps
be
call
a
moral
virtue
,
savour
but
little
of
that
sublime
,
Christian
-
like
disposition
,
that
vast
elevation
of
thought
,
in
purity
approach
to
angelic
perfection
,
to
be
attain
,
express
,
and
feel
only
by
grace

<EOS>
those
,
"
he

,
"
come
nearer
to
the
scripture
meaning
,
who
understand
by
it
candour
,
or
the
forming
of
a
benevolent
opinion
of
our
brother
,
and
pass
a
favourable
judgment
on
their
action
;
a
virtue
much
high
,
and
more
extensive
in
its
nature
,
than
a
pitiful
distribution
of
alm
,
which
,
though
we
would
never
so
much
prejudice
,
or
even
ruin
our
family
,
could
never
reach
many
;
whereas
charity
,
in
the
other
and
truer
sense
,
may
be
extend
to
all
mankind
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
consider
who
the
disciple
be
,
it
would
be
absurd
to
conceive
the
doctrine
of
generosity
,
or
give
alm
,
to
have
be
preach
to
them
.
<EOS>
and
,
as
we
could
not
well
imagine
this
doctrine
should
be
preach
by
its
Divine
Author
to
man
who
could
not
practise
it
,
much
less
<EOS>
should
we
think
it
understand
so
by
those
who
can
practise
it
,
and
do
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
though
,
"
continue
he
,
"
there
be
,
I
be
afraid
,
little
merit
in
these
benefaction
,
there
would
,
I
must
confess
,
be
much
pleasure
in
them
to
a
good
mind
,
if
it
be
not
abate
by
one
consideration
.
<EOS>
I
mean
,
that
we
be
liable
to
be
impose
upon
,
and
to
confer
our
choice
favour
often
on
the
undeserving
,
as
you
must
own
<EOS>
be
your
case
in
your
bounty
to
that
worthless
fellow
Partridge
:
for
two
or
three
such
example
must
greatly
lessen
the
inward
satisfaction
which
a
good
man
would
otherwise
find
in
generosity
;
nay
,
may
even
make
him
timorous
in
bestowing
,
lest
he
should
be
guilty
of
support
vice
,
and
encourage
the
wicked
;
a
crime
of
a
very
black
dye
,
and
for
which
it
will
by
no
means
be
a
sufficient
excuse
,
that
we
have
not
actually
intend
such
an
encouragement
;
unless
we
have
use
the
utmost
caution
in
chuse
the
object
of
our
beneficence
.
<EOS>
a
consideration
which
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
hath
greatly
check
the
liberality
of
many
a
worthy
and
pious
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
answer
,
"
He
could
not
dispute
with
the
captain
in
the
greek
language
,
and
therefore
could
say
nothing
as
to
the
true
sense
of
the
word
which
be
translate
charity
;
but
that
he
have
always
think
it
be
interpret
to
consist
in
action
,
and
that
give
alm
constitute
at
least
one
branch
of
that
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
to
the
meritorious
part
,
"
he
say
,
"
he
readily
agree
with
the
captain
;
for
where
could
be
the
merit
of
barely
discharge
a
duty
?
<EOS>
which
,
"
he
say
,
"
let
the
word
charity
have
what
construction
it
would
,
it
sufficiently
appear
to
be
from
the
whole
tenor
of
the
New
Testament
.
<EOS>
and
as
he
think
it
an
indispensable
duty
,
enjoin
both
by
the
christian
law
,
and
by
the
law
of
nature
itself
;
so
be
it
withal
so
pleasant
,
that
if
any
duty
could
be
say
to
be
its
own
reward
,
or
to
pay
us
while
we
be
discharge
it
,
it
be
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
confess
the
truth
,
"
say
he
,
"
there
be
one
degree
of
generosity
(
of
charity
I
would
have
call
it
)
,
which
seem
to
have
some
show
of
merit
,
and
that
is
,
where
,
from
a
principle
of
benevolence
and
christian
love
,
we
bestow
on
another
what
we
really
want
ourselves
;
where
,
in
order
to
lessen
the
distress
of
another
,
we
condescend
to
share
some
part
of
them
,
by
give
what
even
our
own
necessity
can
not
well
spare
.
<EOS>
this
be
,
I
think
,
meritorious
;
but
to
relieve
our
brother
only
with
our
superfluity
;
to
be
charitable
(
I
must
use
the
word
)
rather
at
the
expense
of
our
coffer
than
ourselves
;
to
save
several
family
from
misery
rather
than
hang
up
an
extraordinary
picture
in
our
house
or
gratify
any
other
idle
ridiculous
vanity
 
<EOS>
this
seem
to
be
only
be
human
creature
.
<EOS>
nay
,
I
will
venture
to
go
farther
,
it
be
be
in
some
degree
epicure
:
for
what
could
the
great
epicure
wish
rather
than
to
eat
with
many
mouth
instead
of
one
?
<EOS>
which
I
think
may
be
predicate
of
any
one
who
know
that
the
bread
of
many
be
owe
to
his
own
largesse
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
to
the
apprehension
of
bestow
bounty
on
such
as
may
hereafter
prove
unworthy
object
,
because
many
have
prove
such
;
surely
it
can
never
deter
a
good
man
from
generosity
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
a
few
or
many
example
of
ingratitude
can
justify
a
man
's
harden
his
heart
against
the
distress
of
his
fellow
-
creature
;
nor
do
I
believe
it
can
ever
have
such
effect
on
a
truly
benevolent
mind
.
<EOS>
nothing
less
than
a
persuasion
of
universal
depravity
can
lock
up
the
charity
of
a
good
man
;
and
this
persuasion
must
lead
him
,
I
think
,
either
into
atheism
,
or
enthusiasm
;
but
surely
it
be
unfair
to
argue
such
universal
depravity
from
a
few
vicious
individual
;
nor
be
this
,
I
believe
,
ever
do
by
a
man
,
who
,
upon
search
his
own
mind
,
find
one
certain
exception
to
the
general
rule
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
conclude
by
ask
,
"
who
that
Partridge
be
,
whom
he
have
call
a
worthless
fellow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
"
say
the
captain
,
"
partridge
the
barber
,
the
schoolmaster
<EOS>
,
what
do
you
call
him
?
<EOS>
Partridge
,
the
father
of
the
little
child
which
you
find
in
your
bed
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
exprest
great
surprize
at
this
account
,
and
the
captain
as
great
at
his
ignorance
of
it
<EOS>
;
for
he
say
he
have
know
it
above
a
month
:
and
at
length
recollect
with
much
difficulty
that
he
be
tell
it
by
Mrs
Wilkins
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
,
Wilkins
be
immediately
summon
;
who
have
confirm
what
the
captain
have
say
,
be
by
Mr
Allworthy
,
by
and
with
the
captain
's
advice
,
dispatch
to
Little
Baddington
,
to
inform
herself
of
the
truth
of
the
fact
:
for
the
captain
expr
great
dislike
at
all
hasty
proceeding
in
criminal
matter
,
and
say
he
would
by
no
mean
have
Mr
Allworthy
take
any
resolution
either
to
the
prejudice
of
the
child
or
its
father
,
before
he
be
satisfied
that
the
latter
be
guilty
;
for
though
he
have
privately
satisfy
himself
of
this
from
one
of
Partridge
's
neighbour
,
yet
he
be
too
generous
to
give
any
such
evidence
to
Mr
Allworthy
.
    
<EOS>
the
trial
of
Partridge
,
the
schoolmaster
,
for
incontinency
;
the
evidence
of
his
wife
;
a
short
reflection
on
the
wisdom
of
our
law
;
with
other
grave
matter
,
which
those
will
like
good
who
understand
them
most
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
wonder
that
a
story
so
well
known
,
and
which
have
furnish
so
much
matter
of
conversation
,
should
never
have
be
mention
to
Mr
Allworthy
himself
,
who
be
perhaps
the
only
person
in
that
country
who
have
never
hear
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
to
account
in
some
measure
for
this
to
the
reader
,
I
think
proper
to
inform
him
,
that
there
be
no
one
in
the
kingdom
less
interested
in
oppose
that
doctrine
concern
the
meaning
of
the
word
charity
,
which
hath
be
see
in
the
precede
chapter
,
than
our
good
man
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
be
equally
intitle
to
this
virtue
in
either
sense
;
for
as
no
man
be
ever
more
sensible
of
the
want
,
or
more
ready
to
relieve
the
distress
of
other
,
so
none
could
be
more
tender
of
their
character
,
or
slow
to
believe
anything
to
their
disadvantage
.
  
<EOS>
scandal
,
therefore
,
never
find
any
access
to
his
table
;
for
as
it
hath
be
long
since
observe
that
you
may
know
a
man
by
his
companion
,
so
I
will
venture
to
say
,
that
,
by
attend
to
the
conversation
at
a
great
man
's
table
,
you
may
satisfy
yourself
of
his
religion
,
his
politic
,
his
taste
,
and
indeed
of
his
entire
disposition
:
for
though
a
few
odd
fellow
will
utter
their
own
sentiment
in
all
place
,
yet
much
the
great
part
of
mankind
have
enough
of
the
courtier
to
accommodate
their
conversation
to
the
taste
and
inclination
of
their
superior
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
Mrs
Wilkins
,
who
,
have
execute
her
commission
with
great
dispatch
,
though
at
fifteen
mile
distance
,
bring
back
such
a
confirmation
of
the
schoolmaster
's
guilt
,
that
Mr
Allworthy
determine
to
send
for
the
criminal
,
and
examine
him
viva
voce
.
<EOS>
Mr
Partridge
,
therefore
,
be
summon
to
attend
,
in
order
to
his
defence
(
if
he
could
make
any
)
against
this
accusation
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
time
appoint
,
before
Mr
Allworthy
himself
,
at
Paradise
-
hall
,
come
as
well
the
say
Partridge
,
with
Anne
,
his
wife
,
as
Mrs
Wilkins
his
accuser
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
Mr
Allworthy
be
seat
in
the
chair
of
justice
,
Mr
Partridge
be
bring
before
him
.
<EOS>
have
hear
his
accusation
from
the
mouth
of
Mrs
Wilkins
,
he
plead
not
guilty
,
make
many
vehement
protestation
of
his
innocence
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Partridge
be
then
examine
,
who
,
after
a
modest
apology
for
be
oblige
to
speak
the
truth
against
her
husband
,
relate
all
the
circumstance
with
which
the
reader
hath
already
be
acquaint
;
and
at
last
conclude
with
her
husband
's
confession
of
his
guilt
.
  
<EOS>
whether
she
have
forgive
him
or
no
,
I
will
not
venture
to
determine
;
but
it
be
certain
she
be
an
unwilling
witness
in
this
cause
;
and
it
be
probable
from
certain
other
reason
,
would
never
have
be
bring
to
depose
as
she
do
,
have
not
Mrs
Wilkins
,
with
great
art
,
fish
all
out
of
her
at
her
own
house

and
have
she
not
indeed
make
promise
,
in
Mr
Allworthy
's
name
,
that
the
punishment
of
her
husband
should
not
be
such
as
may
anywise
affect
his
family
.
  
<EOS>
Partridge
still
persist
in
assert
his
innocence
,
though
he
admit
he
have
make
the
above
-
mention
confession
;
which
he
however
endeavour
to
account
for
,
by
protest
that
he
be
force
into
it
by
the
continue
importunity
she
use
:
who
vow
,
that
,
as
she
be
sure
of
his
guilt
,
she
would
never
leave
torment
him
till
he
have
own
it
;
and
faithfully
promise
,
that
,
in
such
case
,
she
would
never
mention
it
to
him
more
.
<EOS>
hence
,
he
say
,
he
have
be
induce
falsely
to
confess
himself
guilty
,
though
he
be
innocent
;
and
that
he
believe
he
should
have
confest
a
murder
from
the
same
motive
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Partridge
could
not
bear
this
imputation
with
patience
;
and
have
no
other
remedy
in
the
present
place
but
tear
,
she
call
forth
a
plentiful
assistance
from
them
,
and
then
address
herself
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
she
say
(
or
rather
cry
)
,
"
May
it
please
your
worship
,
there
never
be
any
poor
woman
so
injure
as
I
be
by
that
base
man

for
this
be
not
the
only
instance
of
his
falsehood
to
me

<EOS>
no

may
it
please
your
worship

he
hath
injure
my

<EOS>
many
be
the
good
time
and
often

<EOS>
I
could
have
put
up
with
his
drunkenness
and
neglect
of
his
business
,
if
he
have
not
break
one
of
the
sacred
commandment

<EOS>
besides
,
if
it
have
be
out
of
door
I
have
not
matter
it
so
much
;
but
with
my
own
servant

in
my
own
house
,
under
my
own
roof
,
to
defile
my
own
chaste
bed

which
to
be
sure
he
hath

with
his
beastly
stink
whore

<EOS>
yes
,
you
villain
,
you
have
defile
my
own
bed
,
you
have
;
and
then
you
have
charge
me
with
bullocke
you
into
own
the
truth

<EOS>
It
be
very
likely
,
an't
please
your
worship
,
that
I
should
bullock
him
?
<EOS>
I
have
mark
enow
about
my

to
show
of
his
cruelty
to
me

<EOS>
if
you
have
be
a

you
villain

you
would
have
scorn
to
injure
a

You

You

"
  
<EOS>
here
Mr
Allworthy
interrupt
,
and
beg
her
to
be
pacify
,
promise
her
that
she
should
have
justice
;
then
turn
to
Partridge
,
who
stand
aghast
,
one
half
of
his
wit
be
hurry
away
by
surprize
and
the
other
half
by
fear
,
he
say
he
be
sorry
to
see
there
be
so
wicked
a
man
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
He
assure
him
that
his
prevaricate
and
lie
backward
and
forward
be
a
great
aggravation
of
his
guilt
;
for
which
the
only
atonement
he
could
make
be
by
confession
and
repentance
.
<EOS>
He
exhort
him
,
therefore
,
to
begin
by
immediately
confess
the
fact
,
and
not
to
persist
in
deny
what
be
so
plainly
prove
against
him
even
by
his
own
wife
.
  
<EOS>
here
,
reader
,
I
beg
your
patience
a
moment
,
while
I
make
a
just
compliment
to
the
great
wisdom
and
sagacity
of
our
law
,
which
refuse
to
admit
the
evidence
of
a
wife
for
or
against
her
husband
.
<EOS>
this
,
say
a
certain
learn
author
,
who
,
I
believe
,
be
never
quote
before
in
any
but
a
law
-
book
,
would
be
the
mean
of
create
an
eternal
dissension
between
them
.
<EOS>
It
would
,
indeed
,
be
the
mean
of
much
perjury
,
and
of
much
whipping
,
fine
,
imprison
,
transport
,
and
hang
.
  
<EOS>
Partridge
stand
a
while
silent
,
till
,
be
bid
to
speak
<EOS>
,
he
say
he
have
already
speak
the
truth
,
and
appeal
to
Heaven
for
his
innocence
,
and
lastly
to
the
girl
herself
,
whom
he
desire
his
worship
immediately
to
send
for
;
for
he
be
ignorant
,
or
at
least
pretend
to
be
so
,
that
she
have
leave
that
part
of
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
,
whose
natural
love
of
justice
,
join
to
his
coolness
of
temper
,
make
him
always
a
most
patient
magistrate
in
hear
all
the
witness
which
an
accuse
person
could
produce
in
his
defence
,
agree
to
defer
his
final
determination
of
this
matter
till
the
arrival
of
Jenny
,
for
whom
he
immediately
dispatch
a
messenger
;
and
then
have
recommend
peace
between
Partridge
and
his
wife
(
though
he
address
himself
chiefly
to
the
wrong
person
)
,
he
appoint
them
to
attend
again
the
third
day
;
for
he
have
send
Jenny
a
whole
day
's
journey
from
his
own
house
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
appoint
time
the
party
all
assemble
,
when
the
messenger
return
bring
word
,
that
Jenny
be
not
to
be
find
;
for
that
she
have
leave
her
habitation
a
few
day
before
,
in
company
with
a
recruiting
officer
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
then
declare
that
the
evidence
of
such
a
slut
as
she
appear
to
be
would
have
deserve
no
credit
;
but
he
say
he
could
not
help
think
that
,
have
she
be
present
,
and
would
have
declare
the
truth
,
she
must
have
confirm
what
so
many
circumstance
,
together
with
his
own
confession
,
and
the
declaration
of
his
wife
that
she
have
catch
her
husband
in
the
fact
,
do
sufficiently
prove
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
once
more
exhort
Partridge
to
confess
;
but
he
still
avow
his
innocence
,
Mr
Allworthy
declare
himself
satisfied
of
his
guilt
,
and
that
he
be
too
bad
a
man
to
receive
any
encouragement
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
deprive
him
of
his
annuity
,
and
recommend
repentance
to
him
on
account
of
another
world
,
and
industry
to
maintain
himself
and
his
wife
in
this
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
not
,
perhaps
,
many
more
unhappy
person
than
poor
Partridge
.
<EOS>
He
have
lose
the
good
part
of
his
income
by
the
evidence
of
his
wife
,
and
yet
be
daily
upbraided
by
her
for
have
,
among
other
thing
,
be
the
occasion
of
deprive
her
of
that
benefit
;
but
such
be
his
fortune
,
and
he
be
oblige
to
submit
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
though
I
call
him
poor
Partridge
in
the
last
paragraph
,
I
would
have
the
reader
rather
impute
that
epithet
to
the
compassion
in
my
temper
than
conceive
it
to
be
any
declaration
of
his
innocence
.
<EOS>
whether
he
be
innocent
or
not
will
perhaps
appear
hereafter
;
but
if
the
historic
muse
hath
entrust
me
with
any
secret
,
I
will
by
no
means
be
guilty
of
discover
them
till
she
shall
give
me
leave
.
  
<EOS>
here
therefore
the
reader
must
suspend
his
curiosity
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
that
,
whatever
be
the
truth
of
the
case
,
there
be
evidence
more
than
sufficient
to
convict
him
before
Allworthy
;
indeed
,
much
less
would
have
satisfy
a
bench
of
justice
on
an
order
of
bastardy
;
and
yet
,
notwithstanding
the
positiveness
of
Mrs
Partridge
,
who
would
have
take
the
sacrament
upon
the
matter
,
there
be
a
possibility
that
the
schoolmaster
be
entirely
innocent
:
<EOS>
for
though
it
appear
clear
on
compare
the
time
when
Jenny
depart
from
Little
Baddington
with
that
of
her
delivery
that
she
have
there
conceive
this
infant
,
yet
it
by
no
mean
follow
of
necessity
that
Partridge
must
have
be
its
father
;
for
,
to
omit
other
particular
,
there
be
in
the
same
house
a
lad
near
eighteen
,
between
whom
and
Jenny
there
have
subsist
sufficient
intimacy
to
find
a
reasonable
suspicion
;
and
yet
,
so
blind
be
jealousy
,
this
circumstance
never
once
enter
into
the
head
of
the
enrage
wife
.
  
<EOS>
whether
Partridge
repent
or
not
,
accord
to
Mr
Allworthy
's
advice
,
be
not
so
apparent
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
that
his
wife
repent
heartily
of
the
evidence
she
have
give
against
him
:
especially
when
she
find
Mrs
Deborah
have
deceive
her
,
and
refuse
to
make
any
application
to
Mr
Allworthy
on
her
behalf
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
however
,
somewhat
well
success
with
Mrs
Blifil
,
who
be
,
as
the
reader
must
have
perceive
,
a
much
better
-
temper
woman
,
and
very
kindly
undertake
to
solicit
her
brother
to
restore
the
annuity
;
in
which
,
though
good
-
nature
may
have
some
share
,
yet
a
strong
and
more
natural
motive
will
appear
in
the
next
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
these
solicitation
be
nevertheless
unsuccessful
:
for
though
Mr
Allworthy
do
not
think
,
with
some
late
writer
,
that
mercy
consist
only
in
punish
offender
;
yet
he
be
as
far
from
think
that
it
be
proper
to
this
excellent
quality
to
pardon
great
criminal
wantonly
,
without
any
reason
whatever
.
<EOS>
any
doubtfulness
of
the
fact
,
or
any
circumstance
of
mitigation
,
be
never
disregard
:
but
the
petition
of
an
offender
,
or
the
intercession
of
other
,
do
not
in
the
least
affect
him
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
he
never
pardon
because
the
offender
himself
,
or
his
friend
,
be
unwilling
that
he
should
be
punish
.
  
<EOS>
partridge
and
his
wife
be
therefore
both
oblige
to
submit
to
their
fate
;
which
be
indeed
severe
enough
:
<EOS>
for
so
far
be
he
from
double
his
industry
on
the
account
of
his
lessened
income
,
that
he
do
in
a
manner
abandon
himself
to
despair
;
and
as
he
be
by
nature
indolent
,
that
vice
now
increase
upon
him
,
by
which
mean
he
lose
the
little
school
he
have
;
so
that
neither
his
wife
nor
himself
would
have
have
any
bread
to
eat
,
have
not
the
charity
of
some
good
Christian
interpose
,
and
provide
them
with
what
be
just
sufficient
for
their
sustenance
.
  
<EOS>
as
this
support
be
convey
to
them
by
an
unknown
hand
,
they
imagine
,
and
<EOS>
so
,
I
doubt
not
,
will
the
reader
,
that
Mr
Allworthy
himself
be
their
secret
benefactor
;
who
,
though
he
would
not
openly
encourage
vice
,
could
yet
privately
relieve
the
distress
of
the
vicious
themselves
,
when
these
become
too
exquisite
and
disproportionate
to
their
demerit
.
<EOS>
in
which
light
their
wretchedness
appear
now
to
Fortune
herself
;
for
she
at
length
take
pity
on
this
miserable
couple
,
and
considerably
lessen
the
wretched
state
of
Partridge
,
by
put
a
final
end
to
that
of
his
wife
,
who
soon
after
catch
the
small
-
pox
,
and
die
.
  
<EOS>
the
justice
which
Mr
Allworthy
have
execute
on
Partridge
at
first
meet
with
universal
approbation
;
but
no
sooner
have
he
feel
its
consequence
,
than
his
neighbour
begin
to
relent
,
and
to
compassionate
his
case
;
and
presently
after
,
to
blame
that
as
rigour
and
severity
which
they
before
call
justice
.
<EOS>
They
now
exclaim
against
punish
in
cold
blood
,
and
sing
forth
the
praise
of
mercy
and
forgiveness
.
  
<EOS>
these
cry
be
considerably
increase
by
the
death
of
Mrs
Partridge
,
which
,
though
owe
to
the
distemper
above
mention
,
which
be
no
consequence
of
poverty
or
distress
,
many
be
not
ashamed
to
impute
to
Mr
Allworthy
's
severity
,
or
,
as
they
now
term
it
,
cruelty
.
  
<EOS>
partridge
have
now
lose
his
wife
,
his
school
,
and
his
annuity
,
and
the
unknown
person
have
now
discontinue
the
last
-
mention
charity
,
resolve
to
change
the
scene
,
and
leave
the
country
,
where
he
be
in
danger
of
starve
,
with
the
universal
compassion
of
all
his
neighbour
.
    
<EOS>
a
short
sketch
of
that
felicity
which
prudent
couple
may
extract
from
hatred
:
with
a
short
apology
for
those
people
who
overlook
imperfection
in
their
friend
.
 
<EOS>
though
the
captain
have
effectually
demolish
poor
Partridge
,
yet
have
he
not
reap
the
harvest
he
hope
for
,
which
be
to
turn
the
foundling
out
of
Mr
Allworthy
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
that
gentleman
grow
every
day
fonder
of
little
Tommy
,
as
if
he
intend
to
counterbalance
his
severity
to
the
father
with
extraordinary
fondness
and
affection
towards
the
son
.
  
<EOS>
this
a
good
deal
sour
the
captain
's
temper
,
as
do
all
the
other
daily
instance
of
Mr
Allworthy
's
generosity
;
for
he
look
on
all
such
largesse
to
be
diminution
of
his
own
wealth
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
,
we
have
say
,
he
do
not
agree
with
his
wife
;
nor
,
indeed
,
in
anything
else
:
for
though
an
affection
place
on
the
understanding
be
,
by
many
wise
person
,
think
more
durable
than
that
which
be
found
on
beauty
,
yet
it
happen
otherwise
in
the
present
case
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
the
understanding
of
this
couple
be
their
principal
bone
of
contention
,
and
one
great
cause
of
many
quarrel
,
which
from
time
to
time
arise
between
them
;
and
which
at
last
end
,
on
the
side
of
the
lady
,
in
a
sovereign
contempt
for
her
husband
;
and
on
the
husband
's
,
in
an
utter
abhorrence
of
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
as
these
have
both
exercise
their
talent
chiefly
in
the
study
of
divinity
,
this
be
,
from
their
first
acquaintance
,
the
most
common
topic
of
conversation
between
them
.
<EOS>
the
captain
,
like
a
well
-
breed
man
,
have
,
before
marriage
,
always
give
up
his
opinion
to
that
of
the
lady
;
and
this
,
not
in
the
clumsy
awkward
manner
of
a
conceited
blockhead
,
who
,
while
he
civilly
yield
to
a
superior
in
an
argument
,
be
desirous
of
be
still
know
to
think
himself
in
the
right
.
<EOS>
the
captain
,
on
the
contrary
,
though
one
of
the
proud
fellow
in
the
world
,
so
absolutely
yield
the
victory
to
his
antagonist
,
that
she
,
who
have
not
the
least
doubt
of
his
sincerity
,
retire
always
from
the
dispute
with
an
admiration
of
her
own
understanding
and
a
love
for
his
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
this
complacence
to
one
whom
the
captain
thoroughly
despise
,
be
not
so
uneasy
to
him
as
it
would
have
be
have
any
hope
of
preferment
make
it
necessary
to
show
the
same
submission
to
a
Hoadley
,
or
to
some
other
of
great
reputation
in
the
science
,
yet
even
this
cost
him
too
much
to
be
endure
without
some
motive
.
<EOS>
Matrimony
,
therefore
,
have
remove
all
such
motive
,
he
grow
weary
of
this
condescension
,
and
begin
to
treat
the
opinion
of
his
wife
with
that
haughtiness
and
insolence
,
which
none
but
those
who
deserve
some
contempt
themselves
can
bestow
,
and
those
only
who
deserve
no
contempt
can
bear
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
first
torrent
of
tenderness
be
over
,
and
when
,
in
the
calm
and
long
interval
between
the
fit
,
reason
begin
to
open
the
eye
of
the
lady
,
and
she
see
this
alteration
of
behaviour
in
the
captain
,
who
at
length
answer
all
her
argument
only
with
pish
and
pshaw
,
she
be
far
from
endure
the
indignity
with
a
tame
submission
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
at
first
so
highly
provoke
her
,
that
it
may
have
produce
some
tragical
event
,
have
it
not
take
a
more
harmless
turn
,
by
fill
her
with
the
utmost
contempt
for
her
husband
's
understanding
,
which
somewhat
qualify
her
hatred
towards
him
;
though
of
this
likewise
she
have
a
pretty
moderate
share
.
  
<EOS>
the
captain
's
hatred
to
her
be
of
a
purer
kind
:
for
as
to
any
imperfection
in
her
knowledge
or
understanding
,
he
no
more
despise
her
for
them
,
than
for
her
not
be
six
foot
high
.
<EOS>
in
his
opinion
of
the
female
sex
,
he
exceed
the
moroseness
of
Aristotle
himself
:
he
look
on
a
woman
as
on
an
animal
of
domestic
use
,
of
somewhat
high
consideration
than
a
cat
,
since
her
office
be
of
rather
more
importance
;
but
the
difference
between
these
two
be
,
in
his
estimation
,
so
small
,
that
,
in
his
marriage
contract
with
Mr
Allworthy
's
land
and
tenement
,
it
would
have
be
pretty
equal
which
of
them
he
have
take
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
and
yet
so
tender
be
his
pride
,
that
it
feel
the
contempt
which
his
wife
now
begin
to
express
towards
him
;
and
this
,
add
to
the
surfeit
he
have
before
take
of
her
love
,
create
in
him
a
degree
of
disgust
and
abhorrence
,
perhaps
hardly
to
be
exceed
.
  
<EOS>
one
situation
only
of
the
married
state
be
exclude
from
pleasure
:
and
that
is
,
a
state
of
indifference
:
<EOS>
but
as
many
of
my
reader
,
I
hope
,
know
what
an
exquisite
delight
there
be
in
convey
pleasure
to
a
beloved
object
,
so
some
few
,
I
be
afraid
,
may
have
experience
the
satisfaction
of
torment
one
we
hate
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
I
apprehend
,
to
come
at
this
latter
pleasure
,
that
we
see
both
sex
often
give
up
that
ease
in
marriage
which
they
may
otherwise
possess
,
though
their
mate
be
never
so
disagreeable
to
them
.
<EOS>
hence
the
wife
often
put
on
fit
of
love
and
jealousy
,
nay
,
even
deny
herself
any
pleasure
,
to
disturb
and
prevent
those
of
her
husband
;
and
he
again
,
in
return
,
put
frequent
restraint
on
himself
,
and
stay
at
home
in
company
which
he
dislike
,
in
order
to
confine
his
wife
to
what
she
equally
detest
.
<EOS>
hence
,
too
,
must
flow
those
tear
which
a
widow
sometimes
so
plentifully
shed
over
the
ashe
of
a
husband
with
whom
she
lead
a
life
of
constant
disquiet
and
turbulency
,
and
whom
now
she
can
never
hope
to
torment
any
more
.
  
<EOS>
but
if
ever
any
couple
enjoy
this
pleasure
,
it
be
at
present
experience
by
the
captain
and
his
lady
.
<EOS>
It
be
always
a
sufficient
reason
to
either
of
them
to
be
obstinate
in
any
opinion
,
that
the
other
have
previously
assert
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
if
the
one
propose
any
amusement
,
the
other
constantly
object
to
it
:
they
never
love
or
hate
,
commend
or
abuse
,
<EOS>
the
same
person
.
<EOS>
and
for
this
reason
,
as
the
captain
look
with
an
evil
eye
on
the
little
foundling
,
his
wife
begin
now
to
caress
it
almost
equally
with
her
own
child
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
will
be
apt
to
conceive
,
that
this
behaviour
between
the
husband
and
wife
do
not
greatly
contribute
to
Mr
Allworthy
's
repose
,
as
it
tend
so
little
to
that
serene
happiness
which
he
have
design
for
all
three
from
this
alliance
;
but
the
truth
be
,
though
he
may
be
a
little
disappointed
in
his
sanguine
expectation
,
yet
he
be
far
from
be
acquaint
with
the
whole
matter
;
for
,
as
the
captain
be
,
from
certain
obvious
reason
,
much
on
his
guard
before
him
,
the
lady
be
oblige
,
for
fear
of
her
brother
's
displeasure
,
to
pursue
the
same
conduct
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
it
be
possible
for
a
third
person
to
be
very
intimate
,
nay
even
to
live
long
in
the
same
house
,
with
a
married
couple
,
who
have
any
tolerable
discretion
,
and
not
even
guess
at
the
sour
sentiment
which
they
bear
to
each
other
:
for
though
the
whole
day
may
be
sometimes
too
short
for
hatred
,
as
well
as
for
love
;
yet
the
many
hour
which
they
naturally
spend
together
,
apart
from
all
observer
,
furnish
people
of
tolerable
moderation
with
such
ample
opportunity
for
the
enjoyment
of
either
passion
,
that
,
if
they
love
,
they
can
support
be
a
few
hour
in
company
without
toy
,
or
if
they
hate
,
without
spit
in
each
other
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
possible
,
however
,
that
Mr
Allworthy
see
enough
to
render
him
a
little
uneasy
;
for
we
be
not
always
to
conclude
,
that
a
wise
man
be
not
hurt
,
because
he
doth
not
cry
out
and
lament
himself
,
like
those
of
a
childish
or
effeminate
temper
.
<EOS>
but
indeed
it
be
possible
he
may
see
some
fault
in
the
captain
without
any
uneasiness
at
all
;
for
man
of
true
wisdom
and
goodness
be
content
to
take
person
and
thing
as
they
be
,
without
complain
of
their
imperfection
,
or
attempt
to
amend
them
.
<EOS>
They
can
see
a
fault
in
a
friend
,
a
relation
,
or
an
acquaintance
,
without
ever
mention
it
to
the
party
themselves
,
or
to
any
other
;
and
this
often
without
lessen
their
affection
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
unless
great
discernment
be
temper
with
this
overlooking
disposition
,
we
ought
never
to
contract
friendship
but
with
a
degree
of
folly
which
we
can
deceive
;
for
I
hope
my
friend
will
pardon
me
when
I
declare
<EOS>
,
I
know
none
of
them
without
a
fault
;
and
I
should
be
sorry
if
I
could
imagine
I
have
any
friend
who
could
not
see
mine
.
<EOS>
forgiveness
of
this
kind
we
give
and
demand
in
turn
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
exercise
of
friendship
,
and
perhaps
none
of
the
least
pleasant
.
<EOS>
and
this
forgiveness
we
must
bestow
,
without
desire
of
amendment
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
perhaps
,
no
sure
mark
of
folly
,
than
an
attempt
to
correct
the
natural
infirmity
of
those
we
love
.
<EOS>
the
fine
composition
of
human
nature
,
as
well
as
the
fine
china
,
may
have
a
flaw
in
it
;
and
this
,
I
be
afraid
,
in
either
case
,
be
equally
incurable
;
though
,
nevertheless
,
the
pattern
may
remain
of
the
high
value
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
then
,
Mr
Allworthy
certainly
see
some
imperfection
in
the
captain
;
but
as
this
be
a
very
artful
man
,
and
eternally
upon
his
guard
before
him
,
these
appear
to
him
no
more
than
blemish
in
a
good
character
,
which
his
goodness
make
him
overlook
,
and
his
wisdom
prevent
him
from
discover
to
the
captain
himself
.
<EOS>
very
different
would
have
be
his
sentiment
<EOS>
have
he
discover
the
whole
;
which
perhaps
would
in
time
have
be
the
case
,
<EOS>
have
the
husband
and
wife
long
continue
this
kind
of
behaviour
to
each
other
;
but
this
kind
Fortune
take
effectual
mean
to
prevent
,
by
force
the
captain
to
do
that
which
render
him
again
dear
to
his
wife
,
and
restore
all
her
tenderness
and
affection
towards
him
.
    
<EOS>
a
receipt
to
regain
the
lost
affection
of
a
wife
,
which
hath
never
be
know
to
fail
in
the
most
desperate
case
.
 
<EOS>
the
captain
be
make
large
amend
for
the
unpleasant
minute
which
he
pass
in
the
conversation
of
his
wife
(
and
which
be
as
few
as
he
could
contrive
to
make
them
)
,
by
the
pleasant
meditation
he
enjoy
when
alone
.
  
<EOS>
these
meditation
be
entirely
employ
on
Mr
Allworthy
's
fortune
;
for
,
first
,
he
exercise
much
thought
in
calculate
,
as
well
as
he
could
,
the
exact
value
of
the
whole
:
which
calculation
he
often
see
occasion
to
alter
in
his
own
favour
:
and
,
secondly
and
chiefly
,
he
please
himself
with
intended
alteration
in
the
house
and
gardens
,
and
in
project
many
other
scheme
,
as
well
for
the
improvement
of
the
estate
as
of
the
grandeur
of
the
place
:
for
this
purpose
he
apply
himself
to
the
study
of
architecture
and
gardening
,
and
read
over
many
book
on
both
these
subject
;
for
these
science
,
indeed
,
employ
his
whole
time
,
and
form
his
only
amusement
.
<EOS>
He
at
last
complete
a
most
excellent
plan
:
and
very
sorry
we
be
,
that
it
be
not
in
our
power
to
present
it
to
our
reader
,
since
even
the
luxury
of
the
present
age
,
I
believe
,
would
hardly
match
it
.
<EOS>
It
have
,
indeed
,
in
a
superlative
degree
,
the
two
principal
ingredient
which
serve
to
recommend
all
great
and
noble
design
of
this
nature
;
for
it
require
an
immoderate
expense
to
execute
,
and
a
vast
length
of
time
to
bring
it
to
any
sort
of
perfection
.
<EOS>
the
former
of
these
,
the
immense
wealth
of
which
the
captain
suppose
Mr
Allworthy
possess
,
and
which
<EOS>
he
think
himself
sure
of
inherit
,
promise
very
effectually
to
supply
;
and
the
latter
,
the
soundness
of
his
own
constitution
,
and
his
time
of
life
,
which
be
only
what
be
call
middle
-
age
,
remove
all
apprehension
of
his
not
live
to
accomplish
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
be
want
to
enable
him
to
enter
upon
the
immediate
execution
of
this
plan
,
but
the
death
of
Mr
Allworthy
;
in
calculate
which
he
have
employ
much
of
his
own
algebra
,
besides
purchase
every
book
extant
that
treat
of
the
value
of
life
,
reversion
,
&
c.
from
all
which
he
satisfy
himself
,
that
as
he
have
every
day
a
chance
of
this
happening
,
so
have
he
more
than
an
even
chance
of
its
happening
within
a
few
year
.
  
<EOS>
but
while
the
captain
be
one
day
busy
in
deep
contemplation
of
this
kind
,
one
of
the
most
unlucky
as
well
as
unseasonable
accident
happen
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
utmost
malice
of
Fortune
could
,
indeed
,
have
contrive
nothing
so
cruel
,
so
mal
-
a
-
propos
,
so
absolutely
destructive
to
all
his
scheme
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
not
to
keep
the
reader
in
long
suspense
,
just
at
the
very
instant
when
his
heart
be
exult
in
meditation
on
the
happiness
which
would
accrue
to
him
by
Mr
Allworthy
's
death
,
he
himself
 
die
of
an
apoplexy
.
  
<EOS>
this
unfortunately
befel
the
captain
as
he
be
take
his
evening
walk
by
himself
,
so
that
nobody
be
present
to
lend
him
any
assistance
,
if
indeed
,
any
assistance
could
have
preserve
him
.
<EOS>
He
take
,
therefore
,
measure
of
that
proportion
of
soil
which
be
now
become
adequate
to
all
his
future
purpose
,
and
he
lie
dead
on
the
ground
,
a
great
(
though
not
a
live
)
example
of
the
truth
of
that
observation
of
horace
:
  
<EOS>
Tu
secanda
marmora
        
Locas
sub
ipsum
funus
;
et
sepulchri
        
Immemor
,
struis
domos
.
  
<EOS>
which
sentiment
I
shall
thus
give
to
the
english
reader
:
"
You
provide
the
noble
material
for
building
,
when
a
pickaxe
and
a
spade
be
only
necessary
:
and
build
house
of
five
hundred
by
a
hundred
foot
,
forget
that
of
six
by
two
.
"
    
<EOS>
a
proof
of
the
infallibility
of
the
forego
receipt
,
in
the
lamentation
of
the
widow
;
with
other
suitable
decoration
of
death
,
such
as
physicians
,
&
c.
,
and
an
epitaph
in
the
true
stile
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
,
his
sister
,
and
another
lady
,
be
assemble
at
the
accustomed
hour
in
the
supper
-
room
,
where
,
have
wait
a
considerable
time
long
than
usual
,
Mr
Allworthy
first
declare
he
begin
to
grow
uneasy
at
the
captain
's
stay
<EOS>
(
for
he
be
always
most
punctual
at
his
meal
)
;
and
give
order
that
the
bell
should
be
ring
without
the
door
,
and
especially
towards
those
walk
which
the
captain
be
will
not
to
use
.
  
<EOS>
all
these
summon
prove
ineffectual
(
for
the
captain
have
,
by
perverse
accident
,
betaken
himself
to
a
new
walk
that
evening
)
,
Mrs
Blifil
declare
she
be
seriously
frightened
.
<EOS>
upon
which
the
other
lady
,
who
be
one
of
her
most
intimate
acquaintance
,
and
who
well
know
the
true
state
of
her
affection
,
endeavour
all
she
could
to
pacify
her
,
tell
her
 
to
be
sure
she
could
not
help
be
uneasy
;
but
that
she
should
hope
the
good
.
<EOS>
that
,
perhaps
the
sweetness
of
the
evening
have
intice
the
captain
to
go
farther
than
his
usual
walk
:
or
he
may
be
detain
at
some
neighbour
's
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Blifil
answer
,
no
;
she
be
sure
some
accident
have
befall
him
;
for
that
he
would
never
stay
out
without
send
her
word
,
as
he
must
know
how
uneasy
it
would
make
her
.
<EOS>
the
other
lady
,
have
no
other
argument
to
use
,
betook
herself
to
the
entreaty
usual
on
such
occasion
,
and
beg
her
not
to
frighten
herself
,
for
it
may
be
of
very
ill
consequence
to
her
own
health
;
and
,
fill
out
a
very
large
glass
of
wine
,
advise
,
and
at
last
prevail
with
her
to
drink
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
now
return
into
the
parlour
;
for
he
have
be
himself
in
search
after
the
captain
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
sufficiently
show
the
consternation
he
be
under
,
which
,
indeed
,
have
a
good
deal
deprive
him
of
speech
;
but
as
grief
operate
variously
on
different
mind
,
so
the
same
apprehension
which
depress
his
voice
,
elevate
that
of
Mrs
Blifil
.
<EOS>
She
now
begin
to
bewail
herself
in
very
bitter
term
,
and
flood
of
tear
accompany
her
lamentation
;
which
the
lady
,
her
companion
,
declare
she
could
not
blame
,
but
at
the
same
time
dissuade
her
from
indulge
;
attempt
to
moderate
the
grief
of
her
friend
by
philosophical
observation
on
the
many
disappointment
to
which
human
life
be
daily
subject
,
which
,
she
say
,
be
a
sufficient
consideration
to
fortify
our
mind
against
any
accident
,
how
sudden
or
terrible
soever
.
<EOS>
She
say
her
brother
's
example
ought
to
teach
her
patience
,
who
,
though
indeed
he
could
not
be
suppose
as
much
concerned
as
herself
,
yet
be
,
doubtless
,
<EOS>
very
uneasy
,
though
his
resignation
to
the
Divine
will
have
restrain
his
grief
within
due
bound
.
  
<EOS>
"
mention
not
my
brother
,
"
say
Mrs
Blifil
;
"
I
alone
be
the
object
of
your
pity
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
terror
of
friendship
to
what
a
wife
feel
on
these
occasion
?
<EOS>
oh
,
he
be
lose
!
<EOS>
somebody
hath
murder
him
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
see
him
more
!
"
 
<EOS>
here
a
torrent
of
tear
have
the
same
consequence
with
what
the
suppression
have
occasion
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
and
she
remain
silent
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
interval
a
servant
come
run
in
,
out
of
breath
,
and
cry
out
,
the
captain
be
find
;
and
,
before
he
could
proceed
farther
,
he
be
follow
by
two
more
,
bear
the
dead
body
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
here
the
curious
reader
may
observe
another
diversity
in
the
operation
of
grief
:
for
as
Mr
Allworthy
have
be
before
silent
,
from
the
same
cause
which
have
make
his
sister
vociferous
;
so
do
the
present
sight
,
which
draw
tear
from
the
gentleman
,
put
an
entire
stop
to
those
of
the
lady
;
who
first
give
a
violent
scream
,
and
presently
after
fall
into
a
fit
.
  
<EOS>
the
room
be
soon
full
of
servant
,
some
of
whom
,
with
the
lady
visitant
,
be
employ
in
care
of
the
wife
;
and
other
,
with
Mr
Allworthy
,
assist
in
carry
off
the
captain
to
a
warm
bed
;
where
every
method
be
try
,
in
order
to
restore
him
to
life
.
  
<EOS>
and
glad
should
we
be
,
<EOS>
could
we
inform
the
reader
that
both
these
body
have
be
attend
with
equal
success
;
for
those
who
undertake
the
care
of
the
lady
succeed
so
well
,
that
,
after
the
fit
have
continue
a
decent
time
,
she
again
revive
,
to
their
great
satisfaction
:
but
as
to
the
captain
,
all
experiment
of
bleed
,
chafe
,
dropping
,
&
c.
,
prove
ineffectual
.
<EOS>
death
,
that
inexorable
judge
,
have
pass
sentence
on
him
,
and
refuse
to
grant
him
a
reprieve
,
though
two
doctor
who
arrive
,
and
be
fee'd
at
one
and
the
same
instant
,
be
his
counsel
.
  
<EOS>
these
two
doctor
,
whom
,
to
avoid
any
malicious
application
,
we
shall
distinguish
by
the
name
of
Dr
Y.
and
Dr
Z.
,
have
feel
his
pulse
;
to
wit
,
<EOS>
Dr
Y.
his
right
arm
,
and
Dr
Z.
his
left
<EOS>
;
both
agree
that
he
be
absolutely
dead
;
but
as
to
the
distemper
,
or
cause
of
his
death
,
they
differ
;
<EOS>
Dr
Y.
hold
that
he
die
of
an
apoplexy
,
and
Dr
Z.
of
an
epilepsy
.
  
<EOS>
hence
arise
a
dispute
between
the
learn
man
,
in
which
each
deliver
the
reason
of
their
several
opinion
.
<EOS>
these
be
of
such
equal
force
,
that
they
serve
both
to
confirm
either
doctor
in
his
own
sentiment
,
and
make
not
the
least
impression
on
his
adversary
.
  
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
every
physician
almost
hath
his
favourite
disease
,
to
which
he
ascribe
all
the
victory
obtain
over
human
nature
.
<EOS>
the
gout
,
the
rheumatism
,
the
stone
,
the
gravel
,
and
the
consumption
,
have
all
their
several
patron
in
the
faculty
;
and
none
more
than
the
nervous
fever
,
or
the
fever
on
the
spirit
.
<EOS>
and
here
we
may
account
for
those
disagreement
in
opinion
,
concern
the
cause
of
a
patient
's
death
,
which
sometimes
occur
,
between
the
most
learn
of
the
college
;
and
which
have
greatly
surprize
that
part
of
the
world
who
have
be
ignorant
of
the
fact
we
have
above
assert
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
may
perhaps
be
surprize
,
that
,
instead
of
endeavour
to
revive
the
patient
,
the
learn
gentleman
should
fall
immediately
into
a
dispute
on
the
occasion
of
his
death
;
but
in
reality
all
such
experiment
have
be
make
before
their
arrival
:
for
the
captain
be
put
into
a
warm
bed
,
have
his
vein
scarify
,
his
forehead
chafe
,
and
all
sort
of
strong
drop
apply
to
his
lip
and
nostril
.
  
<EOS>
the
physician
,
therefore
,
find
themselves
anticipate
in
everything
they
order
,
be
at
a
loss
how
to
apply
that
portion
of
time
which
it
be
usual
and
decent
to
remain
for
their
fee
,
and
be
therefore
necessitate
to
find
some
subject
or
other
for
discourse
;
and
what
could
more
naturally
present
itself
than
that
before
mention
?
  
<EOS>
Our
doctor
be
about
to
take
their
leave
,
when
Mr
Allworthy
,
have
give
over
the
captain
,
and
acquiesce
in
the
Divine
will
,
begin
to
enquire
after
his
sister
,
whom
he
desire
them
to
visit
before
their
departure
.
  
<EOS>
this
lady
be
now
recover
of
her
fit
,
and
,
to
use
the
common
phrase
,
as
well
as
could
be
expect
for
one
in
her
condition
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
therefore
,
all
previous
ceremony
be
comply
with
,
as
this
be
a
new
patient
,
attend
,
accord
to
desire
,
and
lay
hold
on
each
of
her
hand
,
as
they
have
before
do
on
those
of
the
corpse
.
  
<EOS>
the
case
of
the
lady
be
in
the
other
extreme
from
that
of
her
husband
:
<EOS>
for
as
he
be
past
all
the
assistance
of
physic
,
so
in
reality
she
require
none
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
more
unjust
than
the
vulgar
opinion
,
by
which
physician
be
misrepresent
,
as
friend
to
death
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
I
believe
,
if
the
number
of
those
who
recover
by
physic
could
be
oppose
to
that
of
the
martyr
to
it
,
the
former
would
rather
exceed
the
latter
.
<EOS>
nay
,
some
be
so
cautious
on
this
head
,
that
,
to
avoid
a
possibility
of
kill
the
patient
,
they
abstain
from
all
method
of
curing
,
and
prescribe
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
can
neither
do
good
nor
harm
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
some
of
these
,
with
great
gravity
,
deliver
it
as
a
maxim
,
"
that
Nature
should
be
leave
to
do
her
own
work
,
while
the
physician
stand
by
as
it
be
to
clap
her
on
the
back
,
and
encourage
her
when
she
doth
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
little
then
do
our
doctor
delight
in
death
,
that
they
discharge
the
corpse
after
a
single
fee
;
but
they
be
not
so
disgusted
with
their
living
patient
;
concern
whose
case
they
immediately
agree
,
and
fall
to
prescribe
with
great
diligence
.
  
<EOS>
whether
,
as
the
lady
have
at
first
persuade
her
physician
to
believe
her
ill
,
they
have
now
,
in
return
,
persuade
her
to
believe
herself
<EOS>
so
,
I
will
not
determine
;
but
she
continue
a
whole
month
with
all
the
decoration
of
sickness
.
<EOS>
during
this
time
she
be
visit
by
physician
,
attend
by
nurse
,
and
receive
constant
message
from
her
acquaintance
to
enquire
after
her
health
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
the
decent
time
for
sickness
and
immoderate
grief
be
expire
,
the
doctor
be
discharge
,
and
the
lady
begin
to
see
company
;
be
alter
only
from
what
she
be
before
,
by
that
colour
of
sadness
in
which
she
have
dress
her
person
and
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
the
captain
be
now
inter
,
and
may
,
perhaps
,
have
already
make
a
large
progress
towards
oblivion
,
have
not
the
friendship
of
Mr
Allworthy
take
care
to
preserve
his
memory
,
by
the
follow
epitaph
,
which
be
write
by
a
man
of
as
great
genius
as
integrity
,
and
one
who
perfectly
well
know
the

from
the
time
when
TOMMY

arrive

<EOS>
the
AGE

FOURTEEN
<EOS>

till

the

up
some
hint
concern
the
education
of
child
.
    
<EOS>
contain
little
or
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
the
reader
will
be
pleased
to
remember
,
that
,
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
book
of
this
history
,
we
give
him
a
hint
of
our
intention
to
pass
over
several
large
period
of
time
,
in
which
nothing
happen
worthy
of
be
record
in
a
chronicle
of
this
kind
.
  
<EOS>
in
so
do
,
we
do
not
only
consult
our
own
dignity
and
ease
,
but
the
good
and
advantage
of
the
reader
:
for
besides
that
by
these
mean
we
prevent
him
from
throw
away
his
time
,
in
read
without
either
pleasure
or
emolument
,
we
give
him
,
at
all
such
season
,
an
opportunity
of
employ
that
wonderful
sagacity
,
of
which
he
be
master
,
by
fill
up
these
vacant
space
of
time
with
his
own
conjecture
;
for
which
purpose
we
have
take
care
to
qualify
him
in
the
precede
page
.
  
<EOS>
for
instance
,
what
reader
but
know
that
Mr
Allworthy
feel
,
at
first
,
for
the
loss
of
his
friend
,
those
emotion
of
grief
,
which
on
such
occasion
enter
into
all
man
whose
heart
be
not
compose
of
flint
,
or
their
head
of
as
solid
material
?
<EOS>
again
,
what
reader
doth
not
know
that
philosophy
and
religion
in
time
moderate
,
and
at
last
extinguish
,
this
grief
?
<EOS>
the
former
of
these
teaching
the
folly
and
vanity
of
it
,
and
the
latter
correct
it
as
unlawful
,
and
at
the
same
time
assuage
it
,
by
raise
future
hope
and
assurance
,
which
enable
a
strong
and
religious
mind
to
take
leave
of
a
friend
,
on
his
deathbed
,
with
little
less
indifference
than
if
he
be
prepare
for
a
long
journey
;
and
,
indeed
,
with
little
less
hope
of
see
him
again
.
  
<EOS>
nor
can
the
judicious
reader
be
at
a
great
loss
on
account
of
Mrs
Bridget
Blifil
,
who
,
he
may
be
assure
,
<EOS>
conduct
herself
through
the
whole
season
in
which
grief
be
to
make
its
appearance
on
the
outside
of
the
body
,
with
the
strict
regard
to
all
the
rule
of
custom
and
decency
,
suit
the
alteration
of
her
countenance
to
the
several
alteration
of
her
habit
:
for
as
this
change
from
weed
to
black
,
from
black
to
grey
,
from
grey
to
white
,
so
do
her
countenance
change
from
dismal
to
sorrowful
,
from
sorrowful
to
sad
,
and
from
sad
to
serious
,
<EOS>
till
the
day
come
in
which
she
be
allow
to
return
to
her
former
serenity
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
mention
these
two
,
as
example
only
of
the
task
which
may
be
impose
on
reader
of
the
low
class
.
<EOS>
much
high
and
hard
exercise
of
judgment
and
penetration
may
reasonably
be
expect
from
the
upper
graduate
in
criticism
.
<EOS>
many
notable
discovery
will
,
I
doubt
not
,
be
make
by
such
,
of
the
transaction
which
happen
in
the
family
of
our
worthy
man
,
during
all
the
year
which
we
have
think
proper
to
pass
over
:
for
though
nothing
worthy
of
a
place
in
this
history
occur
within
that
period
,
yet
do
several
incident
happen
of
equal
importance
with
those
report
by
the
daily
and
weekly
historian
of
the
age
;
in
read
which
great
number
of
person
consume
a
considerable
part
of
their
time
,
very
little
<EOS>
,
I
be
afraid
,
to
their
emolument
.
<EOS>
now
,
in
the
conjecture
here
propose
,
some
of
the
most
excellent
faculty
of
the
mind
may
be
employ
to
much
advantage
,
since
it
be
a
more
useful
capacity
to
be
able
to
foretel
the
action
of
man
,
in
any
circumstance
,
from
their
character
,
than
to
judge
of
their
character
from
their
action
.
<EOS>
the
former
,
I
own
,
require
the
great
penetration
;
but
may
be
accomplish
by
true
sagacity
with
no
less
certainty
than
the
latter
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
be
sensible
that
much
the
great
part
of
our
reader
be
very
eminently
possess
of
this
quality
,
we
have
leave
them
a
space
of
twelve
year
to
exert
it
in
;
and
shall
now
bring
forth
our
heroe
,
at
about
fourteen
year
of
age
,
not
question
that
many
have
be
long
impatient
to
be
introduce
to
his
acquaintance
.
    
<EOS>
the
heroe
of
this
great
history
appear
with
very
bad
omen
.
<EOS>
a
little
tale
of
so
LOW
a
kind
that
some
may
think
it
not
worth
their
notice
.
<EOS>
a
word
or
two
concern
a
squire
,
and
more
relate
to
a
gamekeeper
and
a
schoolmaster
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
determine
,
when
we
first
sit
down
to
write
this
history
,
to
flatter
no
man
,
but
to
guide
our
pen
throughout
by
the
direction
of
truth
,
we
be
oblige
to
bring
our
heroe
on
the
stage
in
a
much
more
disadvantageous
manner
than
we
could
wish
;
and
to
declare
honestly
,
even
at
his
first
appearance
,
that
it
be
the
universal
opinion
of
all
Mr
Allworthy
's
family
that
he
be
certainly
bear
to
be
hang
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
be
sorry
to
say
there
be
too
much
reason
for
this
conjecture
;
the
lad
have
from
his
early
year
discover
a
propensity
to
many
vice
,
and
especially
to
one
which
hath
as
direct
a
tendency
as
any
other
to
that
fate
which
we
have
just
now
observe
to
have
be
prophetically
denounce
against
him
:
he
have
be
already
convict
of
three
robbery
,
viz
.
,
of
rob
an
orchard
,
of
steal
a
duck
out
of
a
farmer
's
yard
,
and
of
pick
Master
Blifil
's
pocket
of
a
ball
.
  
<EOS>
the
vice
of
this
young
man
be
,
moreover
,
heighten
by
the
disadvantageous
light
in
which
they
appear
when
oppose
to
the
virtue
of
Master
Blifil
,
his
companion
;
a
youth
of
so
different
a
cast
from
little
Jones
,
that
not
only
the
family
but
all
the
neighbourhood
resound
his
praise
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
indeed
,
a
lad
of
a
remarkable
disposition
;
sober
,
discreet
,
and
pious
beyond
his
age
;
quality
which
gain
him
the
love
of
every
one
who
know
him
:
while
Tom
Jones
be
universally
dislike
;
and
many
express
their
wonder
that
Mr
Allworthy
would
suffer
such
a
lad
to
be
educate
with
his
nephew
,
lest
the
moral
of
the
latter
should
be
corrupt
by
his
example
.
  
<EOS>
an
incident
which
happen
about
this
time
will
set
the
character
of
these
two
lad
more
fairly
before
the
discerning
reader
than
be
in
the
power
of
the
long
dissertation
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
Jones
,
who
,
bad
as
he
be
,
must
serve
for
the
heroe
of
this
history
,
have
only
one
friend
among
all
the
servant
of
the
family
;
for
as
to
Mrs
Wilkins
,
she
have
long
since
give
him
up
,
and
be
perfectly
reconcile
to
her
mistress
.
<EOS>
this
friend
be
the
gamekeeper
,
a
fellow
of
a
loose
kind
of
disposition
,
and
who
be
think
not
to
entertain
much
strict
notion
concern
the
difference
of
meum
and
tuum
than
the
young
gentleman
himself
.
<EOS>
and
hence
this
friendship
give
occasion
to
many
sarcastical
remark
among
the
domestic
,
most
of
which
be
either
proverb
before
,
or
at
least
be
become
so
now
;
and
,
indeed
,
the
wit
of
them
all
may
be
comprise
in
that
short
latin
proverb
,
"
Noscitur
a
socio
;
"
which
,
I
think
,
be
thus
express
in
English
,
"
You
may
know
him
by
the
company
he
keep
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
some
of
that
atrocious
wickedness
in
Jones
,
of
which
we
have
just
mention
three
example
,
may
perhaps
be
derive
from
the
encouragement
he
have
receive
from
this
fellow
,
who
,
in
two
or
three
instance
,
have
be
what
the
law
call
an
accessary
after
the
fact
:
for
the
whole
duck
,
and
great
part
of
the
apple
,
be
convert
to
the
use
of
the
gamekeeper
and
his
family
;
though
,
as
Jones
alone
be
discover
,
the
poor
lad
bore
not
only
the
whole
smart
,
but
the
whole
blame
;
both
which
fall
again
to
his
lot
on
the
follow
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
contiguous
to
Mr
Allworthy
's
estate
be
the
manor
of
one
of
those
gentleman
who
be
call
preserver
of
the
game
.
<EOS>
this
specie
of
man
,
from
the
great
severity
with
which
they
revenge
the
death
of
a
hare
or
partridge
,
may
be
think
to
cultivate
the
same
superstition
with
the
Bannians
in
India
;
many
of
whom
,
we
be
tell
,
dedicate
their
whole
life
to
the
preservation
and
protection
of
certain
animal
;
be
it
not
that
our
English
Bannians
,
while
they
preserve
them
from
other
enemy
,
will
most
unmercifully
slaughter
whole
horse
-
load
themselves
;
so
that
they
stand
clearly
acquit
of
any
such
heathenish
superstition
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
,
indeed
,
a
much
well
opinion
of
this
kind
of
man
than
be
entertain
by
some
,
as
I
take
them
to
answer
the
order
of
Nature
,
and
the
good
purpose
for
which
they
be
ordain
,
in
a
more
ample
manner
than
many
other
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
Horace
tell
us
that
there
be
a
set
of
human
being
  
<EOS>
Fruges
consumere
nati
,
  
"
bear
to
consume
the
fruit
of
the
earth
<EOS>
;
"
so
I
make
no
manner
of
doubt
but
that
there
be
other
  
<EOS>
Feras
consumere
nati
,
  
"
bear
to
consume
the
beast
of
the
field
;
"
or
,
as
it
be
commonly
call
,
the
game
;
and
none
,
I
believe
,
will
deny
but
that
those
squire
fulfil
this
end
of
their
creation
.
  
<EOS>
Little
Jones
go
one
day
a
shooting
with
the
gamekeeper
;
when
happen
to
spring
a
covey
of
partridge
near
the
border
of
that
manor
over
which
Fortune
,
to
fulfil
the
wise
purpose
of
Nature
,
have
plant
one
of
the
game
consumer
,
the
bird
fly
into
it
,
and
be
mark
(
as
it
be
call
)
by
the
two
sportsman
,
in
some
furze
bush
,
about
two
or
three
hundred
pace
beyond
Mr
Allworthy
's
dominion
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
have
give
the
fellow
strict
order
,
on
pain
of
forfeit
his
place
,
never
to
trespass
on
any
of
his
neighbour
;
no
more
on
those
who
be
less
rigid
in
this
matter
than
on
the
lord
of
this
manor
.
<EOS>
with
regard
to
other
,
indeed
,
these
order
have
not
be
always
very
scrupulously
keep
;
but
as
the
disposition
of
the
gentleman
with
whom
the
partridge
have
take
sanctuary
be
well
know
,
the
gamekeeper
have
never
yet
attempt
to
invade
his
territory
.
<EOS>
nor
have
he
do
it
now
,
have
not
the
young
sportsman
,
who
be
excessively
eager
to
pursue
the
fly
game
,
over
-
persuade
him
;
but
Jones
be
very
importunate
,
the
other
,
who
be
himself
keen
enough
after
the
sport
,
yield
to
his
persuasion
,
enter
the
manor
,
and
shoot
one
of
the
partridge
.
  
<EOS>
the
gentleman
himself
be
at
that
time
on
horse
-
back
,
at
a
little
distance
from
them
;
and
hear
the
gun
go
off
,
he
immediately
make
towards
the
place
,
and
discover
poor
Tom
;
for
the
gamekeeper
have
leapt
into
the
thick
part
of
the
furze
-
brake
,
where
he
have
happily
conceal
himself
.
  
<EOS>
the
gentleman
have
search
the
lad
,
and
find
the
partridge
upon
him
,
denounce
great
vengeance
,
swear
he
would
acquaint
Mr
Allworthy
.
<EOS>
He
be
as
good
as
his
word
:
for
he
ride
immediately
to
his
house
,
and
complain
of
the
trespass
on
his
manor
in
as
high
term
and
as
bitter
language
as
if
his
house
have
be
break
open
,
and
the
most
valuable
furniture
steal
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
add
,
that
some
other
person
be
in
his
company
,
though
he
could
not
discover
him
;
for
that
two
gun
have
be
discharge
almost
in
the
same
instant
.
<EOS>
and
,
say
he
,
"
We
have
find
only
this
partridge
,
but
the
Lord
know
what
mischief
they
have
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
his
return
home
,
Tom
be
presently
convene
before
Mr
Allworthy
.
<EOS>
He
own
the
fact
,
and
alledge
no
other
excuse
<EOS>
but
what
be
really
true
,
viz
.
,
that
the
covey
be
originally
spring
in
Mr
Allworthy
's
own
manor
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
be
then
interrogate
who
be
with
him
,
which
Mr
Allworthy
declare
he
be
resolve
to
know
,
acquaint
the
culprit
with
the
circumstance
of
the
two
gun
,
which
have
be
depose
by
the
squire
and
both
his
servant
;
but
Tom
stoutly
persist
in
assert
that
he
be
alone
;
yet
,
to
say
the
truth
,
he
hesitate
a
little
at
first
,
which
would
have
confirm
Mr
Allworthy
's
belief
,
have
what
the
squire
and
his
servant
say
want
any
further
confirmation
.
  
<EOS>
the
gamekeeper
,
be
a
suspect
person
,
be
now
send
for
,
and
the
question
put
to
him
;
but
he
,
rely
on
the
promise
which
Tom
have
make
him
,
to
take
all
upon
himself
,
very
resolutely
deny
be
in
company
with
the
young
gentleman
,
or
indeed
have
see
him
the
whole
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
then
turn
towards
Tom
,
with
more
than
usual
anger
in
his
countenance
,
and
advise
him
to
confess
who
be
with
him
;
repeat
,
that
he
be
resolve
to
know
.
<EOS>
the
lad
,
however
,
still
maintain
his
resolution
,
and
be
dismiss
with
much
wrath
by
Mr
Allworthy
,
who
tell
him
he
should
have
to
the
next
morning
to
consider
of
it
,
when
he
should
be
question
by
another
person
,
and
in
another
manner
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Jones
spend
a
very
melancholy
night
;
and
the
more
so
,
as
he
be
without
his
usual
companion
;
for
Master
Blifil
be
go
abroad
on
a
visit
with
his
mother
.
<EOS>
fear
of
the
punishment
<EOS>
he
be
to
suffer
<EOS>
be
on
this
occasion
his
least
evil
;
his
chief
anxiety
being
,
lest
his
constancy
should
fail
him
,
and
he
should
be
bring
to
betray
the
gamekeeper
,
whose
ruin
he
know
must
now
be
the
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
nor
do
the
gamekeeper
pass
his
time
much
better
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
same
apprehension
with
the
youth
;
for
whose
honour
he
have
likewise
a
much
tender
regard
than
for
his
skin
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
morning
,
when
Tom
attend
the
reverend
Mr
Thwackum
,
the
person
to
whom
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
have
commit
the
instruction
of
the
two
boy
,
he
have
the
same
question
put
to
him
by
that
gentleman
which
he
have
be
ask
the
evening
before
,
to
which
he
return
the
same
answer
.
<EOS>
the
consequence
of
this
be
,
so
severe
a
whipping
,
that
it
possibly
fall
little
short
of
the
torture
with
which
confession
be
in
some
country
extort
from
criminal
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
bear
his
punishment
with
great
resolution
;
and
though
his
master
ask
him
,
between
every
stroke
,
whether
he
would
not
confess
,
he
be
content
to
be
flead
rather
than
betray
his
friend
,
or
break
the
promise
he
have
make
.
  
<EOS>
the
gamekeeper
be
now
relieve
from
his
anxiety
,
and
Mr
Allworthy
himself
begin
to
be
concern
at
Tom
's
suffering
:
for
besides
that
Mr
Thwackum
,
be
highly
enrage
that
he
be
not
able
to
make
the
boy
say
what
he
himself
please
,
have
carry
his
severity
much
beyond
the
good
man
's
intention
,
this
latter
begin
now
to
suspect
that
the
squire
have
be
mistake
;
which
his
extreme
eagerness
and
anger
seem
to
make
probable
;
and
as
for
what
the
servant
have
say
in
confirmation
of
their
master
's
account
,
he
lay
no
great
stress
upon
that
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
cruelty
and
injustice
be
two
idea
of
which
Mr
Allworthy
could
by
no
means
support
the
consciousness
a
single
moment
,
he
send
for
Tom
,
and
after
many
kind
and
friendly
exhortation
,
say
,
"
I
be
convinced
,
my
dear
child
,
that
my
suspicion
have
wrong
you
;
I
be
sorry
that
you
have
be
so
severely
punish
on
this
account
.
"
<EOS>
and
at
last
give
him
a
little
horse
to
make
him
amend
;
again
repeat
his
sorrow
for
what
have
past
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
's
guilt
now
fly
in
his
face
more
than
any
severity
could
make
it
.
<EOS>
He
could
more
easily
bear
the
lash
of
Thwackum
,
than
the
generosity
of
Allworthy
.
<EOS>
the
tear
burst
from
his
eye
,
and
he
fall
upon
his
knee
,
cry
,
"
oh
,
sir
,
you
be
too
good
to
me
.
<EOS>
indeed
you
be
.
<EOS>
indeed
I
do
not
deserve
it
.
"
<EOS>
and
at
that
very
instant
,
from
the
fulness
of
his
heart
,
have
almost
betray
the
secret
;
but
the
good
genius
of
the
gamekeeper
suggest
to
him
what
may
be
the
consequence
to
the
poor
fellow
,
and
this
consideration
seal
his
lip
.
  
<EOS>
Thwackum
do
all
he
could
to
persuade
Allworthy
from
show
any
compassion
or
kindness
to
the
boy
,
say
,
"
He
have
persist
in
an
untruth
;
"
and
give
some
hint
,
that
a
second
whipping
may
probably
bring
the
matter
to
light
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mr
Allworthy
absolutely
refuse
to
consent
to
the
experiment
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
the
boy
have
suffer
enough
already
for
conceal
the
truth
,
even
if
he
be
guilty
,
see
that
he
could
have
no
motive
but
a
mistaken
point
of
honour
for
so
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
honour
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Thwackum
,
with
some
warmth
,
"
mere
stubbornness
and
obstinacy
!
<EOS>
Can
honour
teach
any
one
to
tell
a
lie
,
or
can
any
honour
exist
independent
of
religion
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
discourse
happen
at
table
when
dinner
be
just
end
;
and
there
be
present
Mr
Allworthy
,
Mr
Thwackum
,
and
a
third
gentleman
,
who
now
enter
into
the
debate
,
and
whom
,
before
we
proceed
any
further
,
we
shall
briefly
introduce
to
our
reader
's
acquaintance
.
    
<EOS>
the
character
of
Mr
Square
the
philosopher
,
and
of
Mr
Thwackum
the
divine
;
with
a
dispute
concern
    
<EOS>
the
name
of
this
gentleman
,
who
have
then
reside
some
time
at
Mr
Allworthy
's
house
,
be
Mr
Square
.
<EOS>
His
natural
part
be
not
of
the
first
rate
,
but
he
have
greatly
improve
them
by
a
learned
education
.
<EOS>
He
be
deeply
read
in
the
antient
,
and
a
profest
master
of
all
the
work
of
Plato
and
Aristotle
.
<EOS>
upon
which
great
model
he
have
principally
form
himself
;
sometimes
accord
with
the
opinion
of
the
one
,
and
sometimes
with
that
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
in
moral
he
be
a
profest
Platonist
,
and
in
religion
he
incline
to
be
an
Aristotelian
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
he
have
,
as
we
have
say
,
form
his
moral
on
the
platonic
model
,
yet
he
perfectly
agree
with
the
opinion
of
Aristotle
,
in
consider
that
great
man
rather
in
the
quality
of
a
philosopher
or
a
speculatist
,
than
as
a
legislator
.
<EOS>
this
sentiment
he
carry
a
great
way
;
indeed
,
so
far
,
as
to
regard
all
virtue
as
matter
of
theory
only
.
<EOS>
this
,
it
be
true
,
he
never
affirm
,
as
I
have
hear
,
to
any
one
;
and
yet
upon
the
least
attention
to
his
conduct
,
I
can
not
help
think
it
be
his
real
opinion
,
as
it
will
perfectly
reconcile
some
contradiction
which
may
otherwise
appear
in
his
character
.
  
<EOS>
this
gentleman
and
Mr
Thwackum
scarce
ever
meet
without
a
disputation
;
for
their
tenet
be
indeed
diametrically
opposite
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
Square
hold
human
nature
to
be
the
perfection
of
all
virtue
,
and
that
vice
be
a
deviation
from
our
nature
,
in
the
same
manner
as
deformity
of
body
be
.
<EOS>
Thwackum
,
on
the
contrary
,
maintain
that
the
human
mind
,
since
the
fall
,
be
nothing
but
a
sink
of
iniquity
,
till
purify
and
redeem
by
grace
.
<EOS>
in
one
point
only
they
agree
,
which
be
,
in
all
their
discourse
on
morality
never
to
mention
the
word
goodness
.
<EOS>
the
favourite
phrase
of
the
former
,
be
the
natural
beauty
of
virtue
;
that
of
the
latter
,
be
the
divine
power
of
grace
.
<EOS>
the
former
measure
all
action
by
the
unalterable
rule
of
right
,
and
the
eternal
fitness
of
thing
;
the
latter
decide
all
matter
by
authority
;
but
in
do
this
,
he
always
use
the
scripture
and
their
commentator
,
as
the
lawyer
doth
his
Coke
upon
Lyttleton
,
where
the
comment
be
of
equal
authority
with
the
text
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
short
introduction
,
the
reader
will
be
pleased
to
remember
,
that
the
parson
have
conclude
his
speech
with
a
triumphant
question
,
to
which
he
have
apprehend
no
answer
;
viz
.
,
Can
any
honour
exist
independent
on
religion
?
  
<EOS>
to
this
Square
answer
;
that
it
be
impossible
to
discourse
philosophically
concern
word
,
till
their
meaning
be
first
establish
:
that
there
be
scarce
any
two
word
of
a
more
vague
and
uncertain
signification
,
than
the
two
he
have
mention
;
for
that
there
be
almost
as
many
different
opinion
concern
honour
,
as
concern
religion
.
"
<EOS>
but
,
"
say
he
,
"
if
by
honour
you
mean
the
true
natural
beauty
of
virtue
,
I
will
maintain
it
may
exist
independent
of
any
religion
whatever
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
"
add
he
,
"
you
yourself
will
allow
it
may
exist
independent
of
all
but
one
:
so
will
a
Mahometan
,
a
Jew
,
and
all
the
maintainer
of
all
the
different
sect
in
the
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
Thwackum
reply
,
this
be
argue
with
the
usual
malice
of
all
the
enemy
to
the
true
Church
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
he
doubt
not
but
that
all
the
infidel
and
heretick
in
the
world
would
,
if
they
could
,
confine
honour
to
their
own
absurd
error
and
damnable
deception
;
"
but
honour
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
not
therefore
manifold
,
because
there
be
many
absurd
opinion
about
it
;
nor
be
religion
manifold
,
because
there
be
various
sect
and
heresy
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
when
I
mention
religion
,
I
mean
the
christian
religion
;
and
not
only
the
christian
religion
,
but
the
protestant
religion
;
and
not
only
the
protestant
religion
,
but
the
Church
of
England
.
<EOS>
and
when
I
mention
honour
,
I
mean
that
mode
of
Divine
grace
which
be
not
only
consistent
with
,
but
dependent
upon
,
this
religion
;
and
be
consistent
with
and
dependent
upon
no
other
.
<EOS>
now
to
say
that
the
honour
I
here
mean
,
and
which
be
,
I
think
,
all
the
honour
I
could
be
suppose
to
mean
,
will
uphold
,
much
less
dictate
an
untruth
,
be
to
assert
an
absurdity
too
shocking
to
be
conceive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
purposely
avoid
,
"
say
Square
,
"
draw
a
conclusion
which
I
think
evident
from
what
I
have
say
;
but
if
you
perceive
it
,
I
be
sure
you
have
not
attempt
to
answer
it
.
<EOS>
however
,
to
drop
the
article
of
religion
,
I
think
it
be
plain
,
from
what
you
have
say
,
that
we
have
different
idea
of
honour
;
or
why
do
we
not
agree
in
the
same
term
of
its
explanation
?
<EOS>
I
have
assert
,
that
true
honour
and
true
virtue
be
almost
synonymous
term
,
and
they
be
both
found
on
the
unalterable
rule
of
right
,
and
the
eternal
fitness
of
thing
;
to
which
an
untruth
be
absolutely
repugnant
and
contrary
<EOS>
,
it
be
certain
that
true
honour
can
not
support
an
untruth
.
<EOS>
in
this
,
therefore
,
I
think
we
be
agree
;
but
that
this
honour
can
be
say
to
be
found
on
religion
,
to
which
it
be
antecedent
,
if
by
religion
be
mean
any
positive
law
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
agree
,
"
answer
Thwackum
,
with
great
warmth
,
"
with
a
man
who
assert
honour
to
be
antecedent
to
religion
!
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
,
do
I
agree
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
proceed
when
Mr
Allworthy
interpose
,
tell
them
very
coldly
,
they
have
both
mistake
his
meaning
;
for
that
he
have
say
nothing
of
true
honour
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
possible
,
however
,
he
would
not
have
easily
quiet
the
disputant
,
who
be
grow
equally
warm
,
have
not
another
matter
now
fall
out
,
which
put
a
final
end
to
the
conversation
at
present
.
    
<EOS>
contain
a
necessary
apology
for
the
author
;
and
a
childish
incident
,
which
perhaps
require
an
apology
likewise
.
 
<EOS>
before
I
proceed
farther
,
I
shall
beg
leave
to
obviate
some
misconstruction
into
which
the
zeal
of
some
few
reader
may
lead
them
;
for
I
would
not
willingly
give
offence
to
any
,
especially
to
man
who
be
warm
in
the
cause
of
virtue
or
religion
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
,
therefore
,
no
man
will
,
by
the
gross
misunderstanding
or
perversion
of
my
meaning
,
misrepresent
me
,
as
endeavour
to
cast
any
ridicule
on
the
great
perfection
of
human
nature
;
and
which
do
,
indeed
,
alone
purify
and
ennoble
the
heart
of
man
,
and
raise
him
above
the
brute
creation
.
<EOS>
this
,
reader
,
I
will
venture
to
say
(
and
by
how
much
the
well
man
you
be
yourself
,
by
so
much
the
more
will
you
be
incline
to
believe
me
)
,
that
I
would
rather
have
bury
the
sentiment
of
these
two
person
in
eternal
oblivion
,
than
have
do
any
injury
to
either
of
these
glorious
cause
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
it
be
with
a
view
to
their
service
,
that
I
have
take
upon
me
to
record
the
life
and
action
of
two
of
their
false
and
pretended
champion
.
<EOS>
a
treacherous
friend
be
the
most
dangerous
enemy
;
and
I
will
say
boldly
,
that
both
religion
and
virtue
have
receive
more
real
discredit
from
hypocrite
than
the
witty
profligate
or
infidel
could
ever
cast
upon
them
:
nay
,
farther
,
as
these
two
,
in
their
purity
,
be
rightly
call
the
band
of
civil
society
,
and
be
indeed
the
great
of
blessing
;
so
when
poison
and
corrupt
with
fraud
,
pretence
,
and
affectation
,
they
have
become
the
bad
of
civil
curse
,
and
have
enable
man
to
perpetrate
the
most
cruel
mischief
to
their
own
specie
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
doubt
not
but
this
ridicule
will
in
general
be
allow
:
my
chief
apprehension
be
,
as
many
true
and
just
sentiment
often
come
from
the
mouth
of
these
person
,
lest
the
whole
should
be
take
together
,
and
I
should
be
conceive
to
ridicule
all
alike
.
<EOS>
now
the
reader
will
be
pleased
to
consider
,
that
,
as
neither
of
these
man
be
fool
,
they
could
not
be
suppose
to
have
holden
none
but
wrong
principle
,
and
to
have
utter
nothing
but
absurdity
;
what
injustice
,
therefore
,
must
I
have
do
to
their
character
,
have
I
select
only
what
be
bad
!
<EOS>
and
how
horribly
wretche
and
maim
must
their
argument
have
appear
!
  
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
it
be
not
religion
or
virtue
,
but
the
want
of
them
,
which
be
here
expose
.
<EOS>
have
not
Thwackum
too
much
neglect
virtue
,
and
Square
,
religion
,
in
the
composition
of
their
several
system
,
and
have
not
both
utterly
discard
all
natural
goodness
of
heart
,
they
have
never
be
represent
as
the
object
of
derision
in
this
history
;
in
which
we
will
now
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
this
matter
then
,
which
put
an
end
to
the
debate
mention
in
the
last
chapter
,
be
no
other
than
a
quarrel
between
Master
Blifil
and
Tom
Jones
,
the
consequence
of
which
have
be
a
bloody
nose
to
the
former
;
for
though
Master
Blifil
,
notwithstanding
<EOS>
he
be
the
young
,
be
in
size
above
the
other
's
match
,
yet
Tom
be
much
his
superior
at
the
noble
art
of
boxing
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
,
however
,
cautiously
avoid
all
engagement
with
that
youth
;
for
besides
that
Tommy
Jones
be
an
inoffensive
lad
amidst
all
his
roguery
,
and
really
love
Blifil
,
Mr
Thwackum
be
always
the
second
of
the
latter
,
would
have
be
sufficient
to
deter
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
well
say
a
certain
author
,
no
man
be
wise
at
all
hour
;
it
be
therefore
no
wonder
that
a
boy
be
not
so
.
<EOS>
a
difference
arise
at
play
between
the
two
lad
,
Master
Blifil
call
Tom
a
beggarly
bastard
.
<EOS>
upon
which
the
latter
,
who
be
somewhat
passionate
in
his
disposition
,
immediately
cause
that
phenomenon
in
the
face
of
the
former
,
which
we
have
above
remember
.
  
<EOS>
Master
Blifil
now
,
with
his
blood
run
from
his
nose
,
and
the
tear
gallop
after
from
his
eye
,
appear
before
his
uncle
and
the
tremendous
Thwackum
.
<EOS>
in
which
court
an
indictment
of
assault
,
battery
,
and
wounding
,
be
instantly
prefer
against
Tom
;
who
in
his
excuse
only
plead
the
provocation
,
which
be
indeed
all
the
matter
that
Master
Blifil
have
omit
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
possible
that
this
circumstance
may
have
escape
his
memory
;
for
,
in
his
reply
,
he
positively
insist
,
that
he
have
make
use
of
no
such
appellation
;
add
,
"
Heaven
forbid
such
naughty
word
should
ever
come
out
of
his
mouth
!
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
,
though
against
all
form
of
law
,
rejoin
in
affirmance
of
the
word
.
<EOS>
upon
which
Master
Blifil
say
,
"
It
be
no
wonder
.
<EOS>
those
who
will
tell
one
fib
,
will
hardly
stick
at
another
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
tell
my
master
such
a
wicked
fib
as
you
have
do
,
I
should
be
ashamed
to
show
my
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
fib
,
child
?
"
cry
Thwackum
pretty
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
he
tell
you
that
nobody
be
with
him
a
shooting
when
he
kill
the
partridge
;
but
he
know
"
(
here
he
burst
into
a
flood
of
tear
)
,
"
yes
,
he
know
,
for
he
confess
it
to
me
,
that
Black
George
the
gamekeeper
be
there
.
<EOS>
nay
,
he
say
 
yes
you
do
 
deny
it
if
you
can
,
that
you
would
not
have
confest
the
truth
,
though
master
have
cut
you
to
piece
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
this
the
fire
flash
from
Thwackum
's
eye
,
and
he
cry
out
in
triumph
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
ho
!
<EOS>
this
be
your
mistaken
notion
of
honour
!
<EOS>
this
be
the
boy
who
be
not
to
be
whip
again
!
"
<EOS>
but
Mr
Allworthy
,
with
a
more
gentle
aspect
,
turn
towards
the
lad
,
and
say
,
"
be
this
true
,
child
?
<EOS>
how
come
you
to
persist
so
obstinately
in
a
falsehood
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tom
say
,
"
He
scorn
a
lie
as
much
as
any
one
:
but
he
think
his
honour
engage
him
to
act
as
he
do
;
for
he
have
promise
the
poor
fellow
to
conceal
him
:
which
,
"
he
say
,
"
he
think
himself
farther
oblige
to
,
as
the
gamekeeper
have
beg
him
not
to
go
into
the
gentleman
's
manor
,
and
have
at
last
go
himself
,
in
compliance
with
his
persuasion
.
"
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
this
be
the
whole
truth
of
the
matter
,
and
he
would
take
his
oath
of
it
;
"
and
conclude
with
very
passionately
beg
Mr
Allworthy
"
to
have
compassion
on
the
poor
fellow
's
family
,
especially
as
he
himself
only
have
be
guilty
,
and
the
other
have
be
very
difficultly
prevail
on
to
do
what
he
do
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
it
could
hardly
be
call
a
lie
that
I
tell
;
for
the
poor
fellow
be
entirely
innocent
of
the
whole
matter
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
go
alone
after
the
bird
;
nay
,
I
do
go
at
first
,
and
he
only
follow
me
to
prevent
more
mischief
.
<EOS>
do
,
pray
,
sir
,
let
me
be
punish
;
take
my
little
horse
away
again
;
but
pray
,
sir
,
forgive
poor
George
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
hesitate
a
few
moment
,
and
then
dismiss
the
boy
,
advise
them
to
live
more
friendly
and
peaceably
together
.
    
<EOS>
the
opinion
of
the
divine
and
the
philosopher
concern
the
two
boy
;
with
some
reason
for
their
opinion
,
and
other
matter
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
probable
,
that
by
disclose
this
secret
,
which
have
be
communicate
in
the
utmost
confidence
to
him
,
young
Blifil
preserve
his
companion
from
a
good
lashing
;
for
the
offence
of
the
bloody
nose
would
have
be
of
itself
sufficient
cause
for
Thwackum
to
have
proceed
to
correction
;
but
now
this
be
totally
absorb
in
the
consideration
of
the
other
matter
;
and
with
regard
to
this
,
Mr
Allworthy
declare
privately
,
he
think
the
boy
deserve
reward
rather
than
punishment
,
so
that
Thwackum
's
hand
be
withhold
by
a
general
pardon
.
  
<EOS>
Thwackum
,
whose
meditation
be
full
of
birch
,
exclaim
against
this
weak
,
and
,
as
he
say
he
would
venture
to
call
it
,
wicked
lenity
.
<EOS>
to
remit
the
punishment
of
such
crime
be
,
he
say
,
to
encourage
them
.
<EOS>
He
enlarge
much
on
the
correction
of
child
,
and
quote
many
text
from
Solomon
,
and
other
;
which
be
to
be
find
in
so
many
other
book
,
shall
not
be
find
here
.
<EOS>
He
then
apply
himself
to
the
vice
of
lying
,
on
which
head
he
be
altogether
as
learn
as
he
have
be
on
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
Square
say
,
he
have
be
endeavour
to
reconcile
the
behaviour
of
Tom
with
his
idea
of
perfect
virtue
,
but
could
not
.
<EOS>
He
own
there
be
something
which
at
first
sight
appear
like
fortitude
in
the
action
;
but
as
fortitude
be
a
virtue
,
and
falsehood
a
vice
,
they
could
by
no
mean
agree
or
unite
together
.
<EOS>
He
add
,
that
as
this
be
in
some
measure
to
confound
virtue
and
vice
,
it
may
be
worth
Mr
Thwackum
's
consideration
,
whether
a
large
castigation
may
not
be
lay
on
upon
the
account
.
  
<EOS>
as
both
these
learn
man
concur
in
censure
Jones
,
so
be
they
no
less
unanimous
in
applaud
Master
Blifil
.
<EOS>
to
bring
truth
to
light
,
be
by
the
parson
assert
to
be
the
duty
of
every
religious
man
;
and
by
the
philosopher
this
be
declare
to
be
highly
conformable
with
the
rule
of
right
,
and
the
eternal
and
unalterable
fitness
of
thing
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
,
however
,
weigh
very
little
with
Mr
Allworthy
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
prevail
on
to
sign
the
warrant
for
the
execution
of
Jones
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
within
his
own
breast
with
which
the
invincible
fidelity
which
that
youth
have
preserve
,
correspond
much
well
than
it
have
do
with
the
religion
of
Thwackum
,
or
with
the
virtue
of
Square
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
strictly
order
the
former
of
these
gentleman
to
abstain
from
lay
violent
hand
on
Tom
for
what
have
past
.
<EOS>
the
pedagogue
be
oblige
to
obey
those
order
;
but
not
without
great
reluctance
,
and
frequent
muttering
that
the
boy
would
be
certainly
spoil
.
  
<EOS>
towards
the
gamekeeper
the
good
man
behave
with
more
severity
.
<EOS>
He
presently
summon
that
poor
fellow
before
him
,
and
after
many
bitter
remonstrance
,
pay
him
his
wage
,
and
dismist
him
from
his
service
;
for
Mr
Allworthy
rightly
observe
,
that
there
be
a
great
difference
between
be
guilty
of
a
falsehood
to
excuse
yourself
,
and
to
excuse
another
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
urge
,
as
the
principal
motive
to
his
inflexible
severity
against
this
man
,
that
he
have
basely
suffer
Tom
Jones
to
undergo
so
heavy
a
punishment
for
his
sake
,
whereas
he
ought
to
have
prevent
it
by
make
the
discovery
himself
.
  
<EOS>
when
this
story
become
public
,
many
people
differ
from
Square
and
Thwackum
,
in
judge
the
conduct
of
the
two
lad
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
Master
Blifil
be
generally
call
a
sneak
rascal
,
a
poor
-
spirited
wretch
,
with
other
epithet
of
the
like
kind
;
whilst
Tom
be
honour
with
the
appellation
of
a
brave
lad
,
a
jolly
dog
,
and
an
honest
fellow
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
his
behaviour
to
Black
George
much
ingratiate
him
with
all
the
servant
;
for
though
that
fellow
be
before
universally
dislike
,
yet
he
be
no
sooner
turn
away
than
he
be
as
universally
pity
;
and
the
friendship
and
gallantry
of
Tom
Jones
be
celebrate
by
them
all
with
the
high
applause
;
and
they
condemn
Master
Blifil
as
openly
as
they
durst
,
without
incur
the
danger
of
offend
his
mother
.
<EOS>
for
all
this
,
however
,
poor
Tom
smart
in
the
flesh
;
for
though
Thwackum
have
be
inhibit
to
exercise
his
arm
on
the
foregoing
account
,
yet
,
as
the
proverb
say
,
It
be
easy
to
find
a
stick
,
&
<EOS>
c.
so
be
it
easy
to
find
a
rod
;
and
,
indeed
,
the
not
be
able
to
find
one
be
the
only
thing
which
could
have
keep
Thwackum
any
long
time
from
chastise
poor
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
have
the
bare
delight
in
the
sport
be
the
only
inducement
to
the
pedagogue
,
it
be
probable
Master
Blifil
would
likewise
have
have
his
share
;
but
though
Mr
Allworthy
have
give
him
frequent
order
to
make
no
difference
between
the
lad
,
yet
be
Thwackum
altogether
as
kind
and
gentle
to
this
youth
,
as
he
be
harsh
,
nay
even
barbarous
,
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
Blifil
have
greatly
gain
his
master
's
affection
;
partly
by
the
profound
respect
he
always
show
his
person
,
but
much
more
by
the
decent
reverence
with
which
he
receive
his
doctrine
;
for
he
have
get
by
heart
,
and
frequently
repeat
,
his
phrase
,
and
maintain
all
his
master
's
religious
principle
with
a
zeal
which
be
surprize
in
one
so
young
,
and
which
greatly
endear
him
to
the
worthy
preceptor
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
Jones
,
on
the
other
hand
,
be
not
only
deficient
in
outward
token
of
respect
,
often
forget
to
pull
off
his
hat
,
or
to
bow
at
his
master
's
approach
;
but
be
altogether
as
unmindful
both
of
his
master
's
precept
and
example
.
<EOS>
He
be
indeed
a
thoughtless
,
giddy
youth
,
with
little
sobriety
in
his
manner
,
and
less
in
his
countenance
;
and
would
often
very
impudently
and
indecently
laugh
at
his
companion
for
his
serious
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Square
have
the
same
reason
for
his
preference
of
the
former
lad
;
for
Tom
Jones
show
no
more
regard
to
the
learn
discourse
which
this
gentleman
would
sometimes
throw
away
upon
him
,
than
to
those
of
Thwackum
.
<EOS>
He
once
venture
to
make
a
jest
of
the
rule
of
right
;
and
at
another
time
say
,
he
believe
there
be
no
rule
in
the
world
capable
of
make
such
a
man
as
his
father
(
for
so
Mr
Allworthy
suffer
himself
to
be
call
)
.
  
<EOS>
Master
Blifil
,
on
the
contrary
,
have
address
enough
at
sixteen
to
recommend
himself
at
one
and
the
same
time
to
both
these
opposite
.
<EOS>
with
one
he
be
all
religion
,
with
the
other
he
be
all
virtue
.
<EOS>
and
when
both
be
present
,
he
be
profoundly
silent
,
which
both
interpret
in
his
favour
and
in
their
own
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
Blifil
content
with
flattering
both
these
gentleman
to
their
face
;
he
take
frequent
occasion
of
praise
them
behind
their
back
to
Allworthy
;
before
whom
,
when
they
two
be
alone
,
and
his
uncle
commend
any
religious
or
virtuous
sentiment
(
for
many
such
come
constantly
from
him
)
<EOS>
he
seldom
fail
to
ascribe
it
to
the
good
instruction
he
have
receive
from
either
Thwackum
or
Square
;
for
he
know
his
uncle
repeat
all
such
compliment
to
the
person
for
whose
use
they
be
mean
;
and
he
find
by
experience
the
great
impression
which
they
make
on
the
philosopher
,
as
well
as
on
the
divine
:
for
,
to
say
the
truth
,
there
be
no
kind
of
flattery
so
irresistible
as
this
,
at
second
hand
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
,
moreover
,
soon
perceive
how
extremely
grateful
all
those
panegyric
on
his
instructor
be
to
Mr
Allworthy
himself
,
as
they
so
loudly
resound
the
praise
of
that
singular
plan
of
education
which
he
have
lay
down
;
for
this
worthy
man
have
observe
the
imperfect
institution
of
our
public
school
,
and
the
many
vice
which
boy
be
there
liable
to
learn
,
have
resolve
to
educate
his
nephew
,
as
well
as
the
other
lad
,
whom
he
have
in
a
manner
adopt
,
in
his
own
house
;
where
he
think
their
moral
would
escape
all
that
danger
of
be
corrupt
to
which
they
would
be
unavoidably
expose
in
any
public
school
or
university
.
  
<EOS>
have
,
therefore
,
determine
to
commit
these
boy
to
the
tuition
of
a
private
tutor
,
Mr
Thwackum
be
recommend
to
him
for
that
office
,
by
a
very
particular
friend
,
of
whose
understanding
Mr
Allworthy
have
a
great
opinion
,
and
in
whose
integrity
he
place
much
confidence
.
<EOS>
this
Thwackum
be
fellow
of
a
college
,
where
he
almost
entirely
reside
;
and
have
a
great
reputation
for
learning
,
religion
,
and
sobriety
of
manner
.
<EOS>
and
these
be
doubtless
the
qualification
by
which
Mr
Allworthy
's
friend
have
be
induce
to
recommend
him
;
though
indeed
this
friend
have
some
obligation
to
Thwackum
's
family
,
who
be
the
most
considerable
person
in
a
borough
which
that
gentleman
represent
in
parliament
.
  
<EOS>
Thwackum
,
at
his
first
arrival
,
be
extremely
agreeable
to
Allworthy
;
and
indeed
he
perfectly
answer
the
character
which
have
be
give
of
him
.
<EOS>
upon
long
acquaintance
,
however
,
and
more
intimate
conversation
,
this
worthy
man
see
infirmity
in
the
tutor
,
which
he
could
have
wish
him
to
have
be
without
;
though
as
those
seem
greatly
overbalance
by
his
good
quality
,
they
do
not
incline
Mr
Allworthy
to
part
with
him
:
nor
would
they
indeed
have
justify
such
a
proceeding
;
for
the
reader
be
greatly
mistaken
,
if
he
conceive
that
Thwackum
appear
to
Mr
Allworthy
in
the
same
light
as
he
doth
to
him
in
this
history
;
and
he
be
as
much
deceive
,
if
he
imagine
that
the
most
intimate
acquaintance
which
he
himself
could
have
have
with
that
divine
,
would
have
inform
him
of
those
thing
which
we
,
from
our
inspiration
,
be
enable
to
open
and
discover
.
<EOS>
of
reader
who
,
from
such
conceit
as
these
,
condemn
the
wisdom
or
penetration
of
Mr
Allworthy
,
I
shall
not
scruple
to
say
,
that
they
make
a
very
bad
and
ungrateful
use
of
that
knowledge
which
we
have
communicate
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
these
apparent
error
in
the
doctrine
of
Thwackum
serve
greatly
to
palliate
the
contrary
error
in
that
of
Square
,
which
our
good
man
no
less
see
and
condemn
.
<EOS>
He
think
,
indeed
,
that
the
different
exuberancie
of
these
gentleman
would
correct
their
different
imperfection
;
and
that
from
both
,
especially
with
his
assistance
,
the
two
lad
would
derive
sufficient
precept
of
true
religion
and
virtue
.
<EOS>
if
the
event
happen
contrary
to
his
expectation
,
this
possibly
proceed
from
some
fault
in
the
plan
itself
;
which
the
reader
hath
my
leave
to
discover
,
if
he
can
:
for
we
do
not
pretend
to
introduce
any
infallible
character
into
this
history
;
where
we
hope
nothing
will
be
find
which
hath
never
yet
be
see
in
human
nature
.
  
<EOS>
to
return
therefore
:
the
reader
will
not
,
I
think
,
wonder
that
the
different
behaviour
of
the
two
lad
above
commemorate
,
produce
the
different
effect
of
which
he
hath
already
see
some
instance
;
and
besides
this
,
there
be
another
reason
for
the
conduct
of
the
philosopher
and
the
pedagogue
;
but
this
be
matter
of
great
importance
,
we
shall
reveal
it
in
the
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
contain
a
well
reason
still
for
the
before
-
mention
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
know
then
,
that
those
two
learn
personage
,
who
have
lately
make
a
considerable
figure
on
the
theatre
of
this
history
,
have
,
from
their
first
arrival
at
Mr
Allworthy
's
house
,
take
so
great
an
affection
,
the
one
to
his
virtue
,
the
other
to
his
religion
,
that
they
have
meditate
the
close
alliance
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
for
this
purpose
they
have
cast
their
eye
on
that
fair
widow
,
whom
,
though
we
have
not
for
some
time
make
any
mention
of
her
,
the
reader
,
we
trust
,
hath
not
forget
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Blifil
be
indeed
the
object
to
which
they
both
aspire
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
seem
remarkable
,
that
,
of
four
person
whom
we
have
commemorate
at
Mr
Allworthy
's
house
,
three
of
them
should
fix
their
inclination
on
a
lady
who
be
never
greatly
celebrate
for
her
beauty
,
and
who
be
,
moreover
,
now
a
little
descend
into
the
vale
of
year
;
but
in
reality
bosom
friend
,
and
intimate
acquaintance
,
have
a
kind
of
natural
propensity
to
particular
female
at
the
house
of
a
friend
 
viz
.
<EOS>
,
to
his
grandmother
,
mother
,
sister
,
daughter
,
aunt
,
niece
,
or
cousin
,
when
they
be
rich
;
and
to
his
wife
,
sister
,
daughter
,
niece
,
cousin
,
mistress
,
or
servant
-
maid
,
if
they
should
be
handsome
.
  
<EOS>
We
would
not
,
however
,
have
our
reader
imagine
,
that
person
of
such
character
as
be
support
by
Thwackum
and
Square
,
would
undertake
a
matter
of
this
kind
,
which
hath
be
a
little
censure
by
some
rigid
moralist
,
before
they
have
thoroughly
examine
it
,
and
consider
whether
it
be
(
as
Shakespear
phrase
it
)
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
stuff
o
'
th
'
conscience
,
"
or
no
.
<EOS>
Thwackum
be
encourage
to
the
undertaking
by
reflect
that
to
covet
your
neighbour
's
sister
<EOS>
be
nowhere
forbid
:
and
he
know
it
be
a
rule
in
the
construction
of
all
law
,
that
"
Expressum
facit
cessare
tacitum
.
<EOS>
"
the
sense
of
which
be
,
"
when
a
lawgiver
set
down
plainly
his
whole
meaning
,
we
be
prevent
from
make
him
mean
what
we
please
ourselves
.
"
<EOS>
as
some
instance
of
woman
,
therefore
,
be
mention
in
the
divine
law
,
which
forbid
us
to
covet
our
neighbour
's
good
,
and
that
of
a
sister
omit
,
he
conclude
it
to
be
lawful
.
<EOS>
and
as
to
Square
,
who
be
in
his
person
what
be
call
a
jolly
fellow
,
or
a
widow
's
man
,
he
easily
reconcile
his
choice
to
the
eternal
fitness
of
thing
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
as
both
of
these
gentleman
be
industrious
in
take
every
opportunity
of
recommend
themselves
to
the
widow
,
they
apprehend
one
certain
method
be
,
by
give
her
son
the
constant
preference
to
the
other
lad
;
and
as
they
conceive
the
kindness
and
affection
which
Mr
Allworthy
show
the
latter
,
must
be
highly
disagreeable
to
her
,
they
doubt
not
but
the
lay
hold
on
all
occasion
to
degrade
and
vilify
him
,
would
be
highly
pleasing
to
her
;
who
,
as
she
hate
the
boy
,
must
love
all
those
who
do
him
any
hurt
.
<EOS>
in
this
Thwackum
have
the
advantage
;
for
while
Square
could
only
scarify
the
poor
lad
's
reputation
,
he
could
flea
his
skin
;
and
,
indeed
,
he
consider
every
lash
he
give
him
as
a
compliment
pay
to
his
mistress
;
so
that
he
could
,
with
the
utmost
propriety
,
repeat
this
old
flogging
line
,
"
<EOS>
Castigo
te
non
quod
odio
habeam
,
sed
quod
AMEM
.
<EOS>
I
chastise
thee
not
out
of
hatred
,
but
out
of
love
.
"
<EOS>
and
this
,
indeed
,
he
often
have
in
his
mouth
,
or
rather
,
accord
to
the
old
phrase
,
never
more
properly
apply
,
at
his
finger
'
end
.
  
<EOS>
for
this
reason
,
principally
,
the
two
gentleman
concur
,
as
we
have
see
above
,
in
their
opinion
concern
the
two
lad
;
this
being
,
indeed
,
almost
the
only
instance
of
their
concurring
on
any
point
;
for
,
beside
the
difference
of
their
principle
,
they
have
both
long
ago
strongly
suspect
each
other
's
design
,
and
hate
one
another
with
no
little
degree
of
inveteracy
.
  
<EOS>
this
mutual
animosity
be
a
good
deal
increase
by
their
alternate
success
;
for
Mrs
Blifil
know
what
they
would
be
at
long
before
they
imagine
it
;
or
,
indeed
,
intend
she
should
:
for
they
proceed
with
great
caution
,
lest
she
should
be
offend
,
and
acquaint
Mr
Allworthy
.
<EOS>
but
they
have
no
reason
for
any
such
fear
;
she
be
well
enough
pleased
with
a
passion
,
of
which
she
intend
none
should
have
any
fruit
but
herself
.
<EOS>
and
the
only
fruit
she
design
for
herself
be
,
flattery
and
courtship
;
for
which
purpose
she
soothe
them
by
turn
,
and
a
long
time
equally
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
indeed
,
rather
inclined
to
favour
the
parson
's
principle
;
but
Square
's
person
be
more
agreeable
to
her
eye
,
for
he
be
a
comely
man
;
whereas
the
pedagogue
do
in
countenance
very
nearly
resemble
that
gentleman
,
who
,
in
the
Harlot
's
Progress
,
be
see
correct
the
lady
in
Bridewell
.
  
<EOS>
whether
Mrs
Blifil
have
be
surfeit
with
the
sweet
of
marriage
,
or
disgust
by
its
bitter
,
or
from
what
other
cause
it
proceed
,
I
will
not
determine
;
but
she
could
never
be
bring
to
listen
to
any
second
proposal
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
at
last
converse
with
Square
with
such
a
degree
of
intimacy
that
malicious
tongue
begin
to
whisper
thing
of
her
,
to
which
,
as
well
for
the
sake
of
the
lady
,
as
that
they
be
highly
disagreeable
to
the
rule
of
right
and
the
fitness
of
thing
,
we
will
give
no
credit
,
and
therefore
shall
not
blot
our
paper
with
them
.
<EOS>
the
pedagogue
,
'
tis
certain
,
whip
on
,
without
get
a
step
near
to
his
journey
's
end
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
he
have
commit
a
great
error
,
and
that
Square
discover
much
sooner
than
himself
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Blifil
(
as
,
perhaps
,
the
reader
may
have
formerly
guess
)
be
not
over
and
above
pleased
with
the
behaviour
of
her
husband
;
nay
,
to
be
honest
,
she
absolutely
hate
him
,
till
his
death
at
last
a
little
reconcile
him
to
her
affection
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
be
therefore
greatly
wonder
at
,
if
she
have
not
the
most
violent
regard
to
the
offspring
she
have
by
him
.
<EOS>
and
,
in
fact
,
she
have
so
little
of
this
regard
,
that
in
his
infancy
she
seldom
see
her
son
,
or
take
any
notice
of
him
;
and
hence
she
acquiesce
,
after
a
little
reluctance
,
in
all
the
favour
which
Mr
Allworthy
shower
on
the
foundling
;
whom
the
good
man
call
his
own
boy
,
and
in
all
thing
put
on
an
entire
equality
with
Master
Blifil
.
<EOS>
this
acquiescence
in
Mrs
Blifil
be
consider
by
the
neighbour
,
and
by
the
family
,
as
a
mark
of
her
condescension
to
her
brother
's
humour
,
and
she
be
imagine
by
all
other
,
as
well
as
Thwackum
and
Square
,
to
hate
the
foundling
in
her
heart
;
nay
,
the
more
civility
she
show
him
,
the
more
they
conceive
she
detest
him
,
and
<EOS>
the
sure
scheme
she
be
lay
for
his
ruin
<EOS>
:
for
as
they
think
it
her
interest
to
hate
him
,
it
be
very
difficult
for
her
to
persuade
them
she
do
not
.
  
<EOS>
Thwackum
be
the
more
confirmed
in
his
opinion
,
as
she
have
more
than
once
slily
cause
him
to
whip
Tom
Jones
,
when
Mr
Allworthy
,
who
be
an
enemy
to
this
exercise
,
be
abroad
;
whereas
she
have
never
give
any
such
order
concern
young
Blifil
.
<EOS>
and
this
have
likewise
impose
upon
Square
.
<EOS>
in
reality
,
though
she
certainly
hate
her
own
son
 
of
which
,
however
monstrous
it
appear
,
I
be
assure
she
be
not
a
singular
instance
 
<EOS>
she
appear
,
notwithstanding
all
her
outward
compliance
,
to
be
in
her
heart
sufficiently
displease
with
all
the
favour
show
by
Mr
Allworthy
to
the
foundling
.
<EOS>
She
frequently
complain
of
this
behind
her
brother
's
back
,
and
very
sharply
censure
him
for
it
,
both
to
Thwackum
and
Square
;
nay
,
she
would
throw
it
in
the
tooth
of
Allworthy
himself
,
when
a
little
quarrel
,
or
miff
,
as
it
be
vulgarly
call
,
arise
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
when
Tom
grow
up
,
and
give
token
of
that
gallantry
of
temper
which
greatly
recommend
man
to
woman
,
this
disinclination
which
she
have
discover
to
him
when
a
child
,
by
degree
abate
,
and
at
last
she
so
evidently
demonstrate
her
affection
to
him
to
be
much
strong
than
what
she
bear
her
own
son
,
that
it
be
impossible
to
mistake
her
any
longer
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
desirous
of
often
see
him
,
and
discover
such
satisfaction
and
delight
in
his
company
,
that
before
he
be
eighteen
year
old
he
be
become
a
rival
to
both
Square
and
Thwackum
;
and
what
be
bad
,
the
whole
country
begin
to
talk
as
loudly
of
her
inclination
to
Tom
,
as
they
have
before
do
of
that
which
she
have
show
to
Square
:
on
which
account
the
philosopher
conceive
the
most
implacable
hatred
for
our
poor
heroe
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
the
author
himself
make
his
appearance
on
the
stage
.
 
<EOS>
Though
Mr
Allworthy
be
not
of
himself
hasty
to
see
thing
in
a
disadvantageous
light
,
and
be
a
stranger
to
the
public
voice
,
which
seldom
reach
to
a
brother
or
a
husband
,
though
it
ring
in
the
ear
of
all
the
neighbourhood
;
yet
be
this
affection
of
Mrs
Blifil
to
Tom
,
and
the
preference
which
she
too
visibly
give
him
to
her
own
son
,
of
the
utmost
disadvantage
to
that
youth
.
  
<EOS>
for
such
be
the
compassion
which
inhabit
Mr
Allworthy
's
mind
,
that
nothing
but
the
steel
of
justice
could
ever
subdue
it
.
<EOS>
to
be
unfortunate
in
any
respect
be
sufficient
,
if
there
be
no
demerit
to
counterpoise
it
,
to
turn
the
scale
of
that
good
man
's
pity
,
and
to
engage
his
friendship
and
his
benefaction
.
  
<EOS>
when
therefore
he
plainly
see
Master
Blifil
be
absolutely
detest
(
for
that
he
be
)
by
his
own
mother
,
he
begin
,
on
that
account
only
,
to
look
with
an
eye
of
compassion
upon
him
;
and
what
the
effect
of
compassion
be
,
in
good
and
benevolent
mind
,
I
need
not
here
explain
to
most
of
my
reader
.
  
<EOS>
Henceforward
he
see
every
appearance
of
virtue
in
the
youth
through
the
magnifying
end
,
and
view
all
his
fault
with
the
glass
invert
,
so
that
they
become
scarce
perceptible
.
<EOS>
and
this
perhaps
the
amiable
temper
of
pity
may
make
commendable
;
but
the
next
step
the
weakness
of
human
nature
alone
must
excuse
;
for
he
no
sooner
perceive
that
preference
which
Mrs
Blifil
give
to
Tom
,
than
that
poor
youth
(
however
innocent
)
begin
to
sink
in
his
affection
as
he
rise
in
hers
.
<EOS>
this
,
it
be
true
,
would
of
itself
alone
never
have
be
able
to
eradicate
Jones
from
his
bosom
;
but
it
be
greatly
injurious
to
him
,
and
prepare
Mr
Allworthy
's
mind
for
those
impression
which
afterwards
produce
the
mighty
event
that
will
be
contain
hereafter
in
this
history
;
and
to
which
,
it
must
be
confest
,
the
unfortunate
lad
,
by
his
own
wantonness
,
wildness
,
and
want
of
caution
,
too
much
contribute
.
  
<EOS>
in
record
some
instance
of
these
,
we
shall
,
if
rightly
understand
,
afford
a
very
useful
lesson
to
those
well
-
dispose
youth
who
shall
hereafter
be
our
reader
;
for
they
may
here
find
,
<EOS>
that
goodness
of
heart
,
and
openness
of
temper
,
though
these
may
give
them
great
comfort
within
,
and
administer
to
an
honest
pride
in
their
own
mind
,
will
by
no
mean
,
alas
!
<EOS>
do
their
business
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
prudence
and
circumspection
be
necessary
even
to
the
good
of
man
.
<EOS>
They
be
indeed
,
as
it
be
,
a
guard
to
Virtue
,
without
which
she
can
never
be
safe
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
enough
that
your
design
,
nay
,
that
your
action
,
be
intrinsically
good
;
you
must
take
care
they
shall
appear
so
.
<EOS>
if
your
inside
be
never
so
beautiful
,
you
must
preserve
a
fair
outside
also
.
<EOS>
this
must
be
constantly
look
to
,
or
malice
and
envy
will
take
care
to
blacken
it
so
,
that
the
sagacity
and
goodness
of
an
Allworthy
will
not
be
able
to
see
through
it
,
and
to
discern
the
beauty
within
.
<EOS>
let
this
,
my
young
reader
,
be
your
constant
maxim
,
that
no
man
can
be
good
enough
to
enable
him
to
neglect
the
rule
of
prudence
;
nor
will
virtue
herself
look
beautiful
,
unless
she
be
bedeck
with
the
outward
ornament
of
decency
and
decorum
.
<EOS>
and
this
precept
,
my
worthy
disciple
,
if
you
read
with
due
attention
,
you
will
,
I
hope
,
find
sufficiently
enforce
by
example
in
the
follow
page
.
  
<EOS>
I
ask
pardon
for
this
short
appearance
,
by
way
of
chorus
,
on
the
stage
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
reality
for
my
own
sake
,
that
,
while
I
be
discover
the
rock
on
which
innocence
and
goodness
often
split
,
I
may
not
be
misunderstood
to
recommend
the
very
mean
to
my
worthy
reader
,
by
which
I
intend
to
show
them
they
will
be
undo
.
<EOS>
and
this
,
as
I
could
not
prevail
on
any
of
my
actor
to
speak
,
I
myself
be
oblige
to
declare
.
    
<EOS>
a
childish
incident
,
in
which
,
however
,
be
see
a
good
-
natured
disposition
in
Tom
Jones
.
 
<EOS>
the
reader
may
remember
that
Mr
Allworthy
give
Tom
Jones
a
little
horse
,
as
a
kind
of
smart
-
money
for
the
punishment
which
he
imagine
he
have
suffer
innocently
.
  
<EOS>
this
horse
Tom
keep
above
half
a
year
,
and
then
ride
him
to
a
neighbouring
fair
,
and
sell
him
.
  
<EOS>
at
his
return
,
be
question
by
Thwackum
what
he
have
do
with
the
money
for
which
the
horse
be
sell
,
he
frankly
declare
he
would
not
tell
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oho
!
<EOS>
"
say
Thwackum
,
"
you
will
not
!
<EOS>
then
I
will
have
it
out
of
your
br
 
h
;
"
that
be
the
place
to
which
he
always
apply
for
information
on
every
doubtful
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
be
now
mount
on
the
back
of
a
footman
,
and
everything
prepare
for
execution
,
when
Mr
Allworthy
,
enter
the
room
,
give
the
criminal
a
reprieve
,
and
take
him
with
him
into
another
apartment
;
where
,
be
alone
with
Tom
,
he
put
the
same
question
to
him
which
Thwackum
have
before
ask
him
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
answer
,
he
could
in
duty
refuse
him
nothing
;
but
as
for
that
tyrannical
rascal
,
he
would
never
make
him
any
other
answer
than
with
a
cudgel
,
with
which
he
hope
soon
to
be
able
to
pay
him
for
all
his
barbarity
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
very
severely
reprimand
the
lad
for
his
indecent
and
disrespectful
expression
concern
his
master
;
but
much
more
for
his
avow
an
intention
of
revenge
.
<EOS>
He
threaten
him
with
the
entire
loss
of
his
favour
,
if
he
ever
hear
such
another
word
from
his
mouth
;
for
,
he
say
,
he
would
never
support
or
befriend
a
reprobate
.
<EOS>
by
these
and
the
like
declaration
,
he
extort
some
compunction
from
Tom
,
in
which
that
youth
be
not
over
-
sincere
;
for
he
really
meditate
some
return
for
all
the
smart
favour
he
have
receive
at
the
hand
of
the
pedagogue
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
however
,
bring
by
Mr
Allworthy
to
express
a
concern
for
his
resentment
against
Thwackum
;
and
then
the
good
man
,
after
some
wholesome
admonition
,
permit
him
to
proceed
,
which
he
do
as
follow
:
    
"
indeed
,
my
dear
sir
,
I
love
and
honour
you
more
than
all
the
world
:
<EOS>
I
know
the
great
obligation
I
have
to
you
,
and
should
detest
myself
if
I
think
my
heart
be
capable
of
ingratitude
.
<EOS>
Could
the
little
horse
you
give
me
speak
,
I
be
sure
he
could
tell
you
how
fond
I
be
of
your
present
;
for
I
have
more
pleasure
in
feed
him
than
in
ride
him
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
sir
,
it
go
to
my
heart
to
part
with
him
;
nor
would
I
have
sell
him
upon
any
other
account
in
the
world
than
what
I
do
.
<EOS>
You
yourself
,
sir
,
I
be
convince
,
in
my
case
,
would
have
do
the
same
:
for
none
ever
so
sensibly
feel
the
misfortune
of
other
.
<EOS>
what
would
you
feel
,
dear
sir
,
if
you
think
yourself
the
occasion
of
them
?
<EOS>
indeed
,
sir
,
there
never
be
any
misery
like
theirs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
like
whose
,
child
?
"
say
Allworthy
:
"
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
sir
!
"
answer
Tom
,
"
your
poor
gamekeeper
,
with
all
his
large
family
,
ever
since
your
discard
him
,
have
be
perish
with
all
the
misery
of
cold
and
hunger
:
I
could
not
bear
to
see
these
poor
wretch
naked
and
starving
,
and
at
the
same
time
know
myself
to
have
be
the
occasion
of
all
their
suffering
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
it
,
sir
;
upon
my
soul
,
I
could
not
.
"
<EOS>
[
here
the
tear
run
down
his
cheek
,
and
he
thus
proceed
.
]
<EOS>
"
It
be
to
save
them
from
absolute
destruction
I
part
with
your
dear
present
,
notwithstanding
all
the
value
I
have
for
it
:
I
sell
the
horse
for
them
,
and
they
have
every
farthing
of
the
money
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
now
stand
silent
for
some
moment
,
and
before
he
speak
the
tear
start
from
his
eye
.
<EOS>
He
at
length
dismiss
Tom
with
a
gentle
rebuke
,
advise
him
for
the
future
to
apply
to
him
in
case
of
distress
,
rather
than
to
use
extraordinary
mean
of
relieve
them
himself
.
  
<EOS>
this
affair
be
afterwards
the
subject
of
much
debate
between
Thwackum
and
Square
.
<EOS>
Thwackum
hold
,
that
this
be
fly
in
Mr
Allworthy
's
face
,
who
have
intend
to
punish
the
fellow
for
his
disobedience
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
in
some
instance
,
what
the
world
call
charity
appear
to
him
to
be
oppose
the
will
of
the
Almighty
,
which
have
mark
some
particular
person
for
destruction
;
and
that
this
be
in
like
manner
act
in
opposition
to
Mr
Allworthy
;
conclude
,
as
usual
,
with
a
hearty
recommendation
of
birch
.
  
<EOS>
Square
argue
strongly
on
the
other
side
,
in
opposition
perhaps
to
Thwackum
,
or
in
compliance
with
Mr
Allworthy
,
who
seem
very
much
to
approve
what
Jones
have
do
.
<EOS>
as
to
what
he
urge
on
this
occasion
,
as
I
be
convince
most
of
my
reader
will
be
much
able
advocate
for
poor
Jones
,
it
would
be
impertinent
to
relate
it
.
<EOS>
indeed
it
be
not
difficult
to
reconcile
to
the
rule
of
right
an
action
which
it
would
have
be
impossible
to
deduce
from
the
rule
of
wrong
.
    
<EOS>
contain
an
incident
of
a
more
heinous
kind
,
with
the
comment
of
Thwackum
and
Square
.
 
<EOS>
It
hath
be
observe
by
some
man
of
much
great
reputation
for
wisdom
than
myself
,
that
misfortune
seldom
come
single
.
<EOS>
an
instance
of
this
may
,
I
believe
,
be
see
in
those
gentleman
who
have
the
misfortune
to
have
any
of
their
roguery
detect
;
for
here
discovery
seldom
stop
till
the
whole
be
come
out
.
<EOS>
thus
it
happen
to
poor
Tom
;
who
be
no
sooner
pardon
for
sell
the
horse
,
than
he
be
discover
to
have
some
time
before
sell
a
fine
Bible
which
Mr
Allworthy
give
him
,
the
money
arise
from
which
sale
he
have
dispose
of
in
the
same
manner
.
<EOS>
this
Bible
Master
Blifil
have
purchase
,
though
he
have
already
such
another
of
his
own
,
partly
out
of
respect
for
the
book
,
and
partly
out
of
friendship
to
Tom
,
be
unwilling
that
the
Bible
should
be
sell
out
of
the
family
at
half
-
price
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
deposit
the
say
half
-
price
himself
;
for
he
be
a
very
prudent
lad
,
and
so
careful
of
his
money
,
that
he
have
lay
up
almost
every
penny
which
he
have
receive
from
Mr
Allworthy
.
  
<EOS>
some
people
have
be
note
to
be
able
to
read
in
no
book
but
their
own
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
from
the
time
when
Master
Blifil
be
first
possess
of
this
Bible
,
he
never
use
any
other
.
<EOS>
nay
,
he
be
see
read
in
it
much
oftener
than
he
have
before
be
in
his
own
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
he
frequently
ask
Thwackum
to
explain
difficult
passage
to
him
,
that
gentleman
unfortunately
take
notice
of
Tom
's
name
,
which
be
write
in
many
part
of
the
book
.
<EOS>
this
bring
on
an
inquiry
,
which
oblige
Master
Blifil
to
discover
the
whole
matter
.
  
<EOS>
Thwackum
be
resolve
a
crime
of
this
kind
,
which
he
call
sacrilege
,
should
not
go
unpunished
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
proceed
immediately
to
castigation
:
and
not
content
with
that
he
acquaint
Mr
Allworthy
,
at
their
next
meeting
,
with
this
monstrous
crime
,
as
it
appear
to
him
:
<EOS>
inveigh
against
Tom
in
the
most
bitter
term
,
and
liken
him
to
the
buyer
and
seller
who
be
drive
out
of
the
temple
.
  
<EOS>
Square
see
this
matter
in
a
very
different
light
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
he
could
not
perceive
any
high
crime
in
sell
one
book
than
in
sell
another
.
<EOS>
that
to
sell
Bibles
be
strictly
lawful
by
all
law
both
Divine
and
human
,
and
consequently
there
be
no
unfitness
in
it
.
<EOS>
He
tell
Thwackum
,
that
his
great
concern
on
this
occasion
bring
to
his
mind
the
story
of
a
very
devout
woman
,
who
,
out
of
pure
regard
to
religion
,
steal
Tillotson
's
Sermons
from
a
lady
of
her
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
this
story
cause
a
vast
quantity
of
blood
to
rush
into
the
parson
's
face
,
which
of
itself
be
none
of
the
palest
;
and
he
be
go
to
reply
with
great
warmth
and
anger
,
have
not
Mrs
Blifil
,
who
be
present
at
this
debate
,
interpose
.
<EOS>
that
lady
declare
herself
absolutely
of
Mr
Square
's
side
.
<EOS>
She
argue
,
indeed
,
very
learnedly
in
support
of
his
opinion
;
and
conclude
with
say
,
if
Tom
have
be
guilty
of
any
fault
,
she
must
confess
her
own
son
appear
to
be
equally
culpable
;
for
that
she
could
see
no
difference
between
the
buyer
and
the
seller
;
both
of
whom
be
alike
to
be
drive
out
of
the
temple
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Blifil
have
declare
her
opinion
,
put
an
end
to
the
debate
.
<EOS>
Square
's
triumph
would
almost
have
stopt
his
word
,
have
he
need
them
;
and
Thwackum
,
who
,
for
reason
before
-
mention
,
durst
not
venture
at
disoblige
the
lady
,
be
almost
choake
with
indignation
.
<EOS>
as
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
he
say
,
since
the
boy
have
be
already
punish
he
would
not
deliver
his
sentiment
on
the
occasion
;
and
whether
he
be
or
be
not
angry
with
the
lad
,
I
must
leave
to
the
reader
's
own
conjecture
.
  
<EOS>
soon
after
this
,
an
action
be
bring
against
the
gamekeeper
by
Squire
Western
(
the
gentleman
in
whose
manor
the
partridge
be
kill
)
,
for
depredation
of
the
like
kind
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
most
unfortunate
circumstance
for
the
fellow
,
as
it
not
only
of
itself
threaten
his
ruin
,
but
actually
prevent
Mr
Allworthy
from
restore
him
to
his
favour
:
for
as
that
gentleman
be
walk
out
one
evening
with
Master
Blifil
and
young
Jones
,
the
latter
slily
draw
him
to
the
habitation
of
Black
George
;
where
the
family
of
that
poor
wretch
,
namely
,
his
wife
and
child
,
be
find
in
all
the
misery
with
which
cold
,
hunger
,
and
nakedness
,
can
affect
human
creature
:
for
as
to
the
money
they
have
receive
from
Jones
,
former
debt
have
consume
almost
the
whole
.
  
<EOS>
such
a
scene
as
this
could
not
fail
of
affect
the
heart
of
Mr
Allworthy
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
give
the
mother
a
couple
of
guinea
,
with
which
he
bid
her
cloath
her
child
.
<EOS>
the
poor
woman
burst
into
tear
at
this
goodness
,
and
while
she
be
thank
him
,
could
not
refrain
from
express
her
gratitude
to
Tom
;
who
have
,
she
say
,
long
preserve
both
her
and
her
from
starve
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
not
,
"
say
she
,
"
have
a
morsel
to
eat
,
nor
have
these
poor
child
have
a
rag
to
put
on
,
but
what
his
goodness
hath
bestow
on
us
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
,
indeed
,
besides
the
horse
and
the
Bible
,
Tom
have
sacrifice
a
night
-
gown
,
and
other
thing
,
to
the
use
of
this
distressed
family
.
  
<EOS>
on
their
return
home
,
Tom
make
use
of
all
his
eloquence
to
display
the
wretchedness
of
these
people
,
and
the
penitence
of
Black
George
himself
;
and
in
this
he
succeed
so
well
,
that
Mr
Allworthy
say
,
he
think
the
man
have
suffer
enough
for
what
be
past
;
that
he
would
forgive
him
,
and
think
of
some
mean
of
provide
for
him
and
his
family
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
be
so
delighted
with
this
news
,
that
,
though
it
be
dark
when
they
return
home
,
he
could
not
help
go
back
a
mile
,
in
a
shower
of
rain
,
to
acquaint
the
poor
woman
with
the
glad
tiding
;
but
,
like
other
hasty
divulger
of
news
,
he
only
bring
on
himself
the
trouble
of
contradict
it
:
for
the
ill
fortune
of
Black
George
make
use
of
the
very
opportunity
of
his
friend
's
absence
to
overturn
all
again
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
Master
Blifil
and
Jones
appear
in
different
light
.
 
<EOS>
Master
Blifil
fall
very
short
of
his
companion
in
the
amiable
quality
of
mercy
;
but
he
as
greatly
exceed
him
in
one
of
a
much
high
kind
,
namely
,
in
justice
:
in
which
he
follow
both
the
precept
and
example
of
Thwackum
and
Square
;
for
though
they
would
both
make
frequent
use
of
the
word
mercy
,
yet
it
be
plain
that
in
reality
Square
hold
it
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
rule
of
right
;
and
Thwackum
be
for
do
justice
,
and
leave
mercy
to
heaven
.
<EOS>
the
two
gentleman
do
indeed
somewhat
differ
in
opinion
concern
the
object
of
this
sublime
virtue
;
by
which
Thwackum
would
probably
have
destroy
one
half
of
mankind
,
and
Square
the
other
half
.
  
<EOS>
Master
Blifil
<EOS>
then
,
though
he
have
keep
silence
in
the
presence
of
Jones
,
yet
,
when
he
have
better
consider
the
matter
,
could
by
no
means
endure
the
thought
of
suffer
his
uncle
to
confer
favour
on
the
undeserving
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
resolve
immediately
to
acquaint
him
with
the
fact
which
we
have
above
slightly
hint
to
the
reader
.
<EOS>
the
truth
of
which
be
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
the
gamekeeper
,
about
a
year
after
he
be
dismiss
from
Mr
Allworthy
's
service
,
and
before
Tom
's
sell
the
horse
,
be
in
want
of
bread
,
either
to
fill
his
own
mouth
or
those
of
his
family
,
as
he
pass
through
a
field
belong
to
Mr
Western
<EOS>
espy
a
hare
sit
in
her
form
.
<EOS>
this
hare
he
have
basely
and
barbarously
knock
on
the
head
,
against
the
law
of
the
land
,
and
no
less
against
the
law
of
sportsman
.
  
<EOS>
the
higgler
to
whom
the
hare
be
sell
,
be
unfortunately
take
many
month
after
with
a
quantity
of
game
upon
him
,
be
oblige
to
make
his
peace
with
the
squire
,
by
become
evidence
against
some
poacher
.
<EOS>
and
now
Black
George
be
pitch
upon
by
him
,
as
be
a
person
already
obnoxious
to
Mr
Western
,
and
one
of
no
good
fame
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
besides
,
the
good
sacrifice
the
higgler
could
make
,
as
he
have
supply
him
with
no
game
since
;
and
by
this
mean
the
witness
have
an
opportunity
of
screen
his
well
customer
:
for
the
squire
,
be
charm
with
the
power
of
punish
Black
George
,
whom
a
single
transgression
be
sufficient
to
ruin
,
make
no
further
enquiry
.
  
<EOS>
have
this
fact
be
truly
lay
before
Mr
Allworthy
,
it
may
probably
have
do
the
gamekeeper
very
little
mischief
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
zeal
blinder
than
that
which
be
inspire
with
the
love
of
justice
against
offender
.
<EOS>
Master
Blifil
have
forget
the
distance
of
the
time
.
<EOS>
He
vary
likewise
in
the
manner
of
the
fact
:
and
by
the
hasty
addition
of
the
single
letter
S
he
considerably
alter
the
story
;
for
he
say
that
George
have
wire
hare
.
<EOS>
these
alteration
may
probably
have
be
set
right
,
have
not
Master
Blifil
unluckily
insist
on
a
promise
of
secrecy
from
Mr
Allworthy
before
he
reveal
the
matter
to
him
;
but
by
that
mean
the
poor
gamekeeper
be
condemn
without
have
an
opportunity
to
defend
himself
:
for
as
the
fact
of
kill
the
hare
,
and
of
the
action
bring
,
be
certainly
true
,
Mr
Allworthy
have
no
doubt
concern
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
short
-
live
then
be
the
joy
of
these
poor
people
;
for
Mr
Allworthy
the
next
morning
declare
he
have
fresh
reason
,
without
assign
it
,
for
his
anger
,
and
strictly
forbad
Tom
to
mention
George
any
more
:
though
as
for
his
family
,
he
say
he
would
endeavour
to
keep
them
from
starve
;
but
as
to
the
fellow
himself
,
he
would
leave
him
to
the
law
,
which
nothing
could
keep
him
from
break
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
could
by
no
means
divine
what
have
incense
Mr
Allworthy
,
for
of
<EOS>
Master
Blifil
<EOS>
he
have
not
the
least
suspicion
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
his
friendship
be
to
be
tired
out
by
no
disappointment
,
he
now
determine
to
try
another
method
of
preserve
the
poor
gamekeeper
from
ruin
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
be
lately
grow
very
intimate
with
Mr
Western
.
<EOS>
He
have
so
greatly
recommend
himself
to
that
gentleman
,
by
leap
over
five
-
bar
gate
,
and
by
other
act
of
sportsmanship
,
that
the
squire
have
declare
Tom
would
certainly
make
a
great
man
if
he
have
but
sufficient
encouragement
.
<EOS>
He
often
wish
he
have
himself
a
son
with
such
part
;
and
one
day
very
solemnly
assert
at
a
drinking
bout
,
that
Tom
should
hunt
a
pack
of
hound
for
a
thousand
pound
of
his
money
,
with
any
huntsman
in
the
whole
country
.
  
<EOS>
by
such
kind
of
talent
he
have
so
ingratiate
himself
with
the
squire
,
that
he
be
a
most
welcome
guest
at
his
table
,
and
a
favourite
companion
in
his
sport
:
everything
which
the
squire
hold
most
dear
,
to
wit
,
his
gun
,
dog
,
and
horse
,
be
now
as
much
at
the
command
of
Jones
,
as
if
they
have
be
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
resolve
therefore
to
make
use
of
this
favour
on
behalf
of
his
friend
Black
George
,
whom
he
hope
to
introduce
into
Mr
Western
's
family
,
in
the
same
capacity
in
which
he
have
before
serve
Mr
Allworthy
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
,
if
he
consider
that
this
fellow
be
already
obnoxious
to
Mr
Western
,
and
if
he
consider
farther
the
weighty
business
by
which
that
gentleman
's
displeasure
have
be
incur
,
will
perhaps
condemn
this
as
a
foolish
and
desperate
undertaking
;
but
if
he
should
totally
condemn
young
Jones
on
that
account
,
he
will
greatly
applaud
him
for
strengthen
himself
with
all
imaginable
interest
on
so
arduous
an
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
for
this
purpose
,
then
,
Tom
apply
to
Mr
Western
's
daughter
,
a
young
lady
of
about
seventeen
year
of
age
,
whom
<EOS>
her
father
,
next
after
those
necessary
implement
of
sport
just
before
mention
,
love
and
esteem
above
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
she
have
some
influence
on
the
squire
,
so
Tom
have
some
little
influence
on
her
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
the
intended
heroine
of
this
work
,
a
lady
with
whom
we
ourselves
be
greatly
in
love
,
and
with
whom
many
of
our
reader
will
probably
be
in
love
too
,
before
we
part
<EOS>
,
it
be
by
no
means
proper
<EOS>
she
should
make
her
appearance
at
the
end
of
a
book
.
  
<EOS>
BOOK
IV
.
  
<EOS>
contain
the
time
of
a
year
.
    
<EOS>
contain
five
page
of
paper
.
 
<EOS>
as
truth
distinguish
our
writing
from
those
idle
romance
which
be
fill
with
monster
,
the
production
,
not
of
nature
,
but
of
distemper
brain
;
and
which
have
be
therefore
recommend
by
an
eminent
critic
to
the
sole
use
of
the
pastry
-
cook
;
so
,
on
the
other
hand
,
we
would
avoid
any
resemblance
to
that
kind
of
history
which
a
celebrated
poet
seem
to
think
be
no
less
calculated
for
the
emolument
of
the
brewer
,
as
the
reading
it
should
be
always
attend
with
a
tankard
of
good
ale
        
<EOS>
while
 
history
with
her
comrade
ale
,
     
soothe
the
sad
series
of
her
serious
tale
  
<EOS>
for
as
this
be
the
liquor
of
modern
historian
,
nay
,
perhaps
their
muse
,
if
we
may
believe
the
opinion
of
Butler
,
who
attribute
inspiration
to
ale
,
it
ought
likewise
to
be
the
potation
of
their
reader
,
since
every
book
ought
to
be
read
with
the
same
spirit
and
in
the
same
manner
as
it
be
writ
.
<EOS>
thus
the
famous
author
of
Hurlothrumbo
tell
a
learn
bishop
,
that
the
reason
his
lordship
could
not
taste
the
excellence
of
his
piece
be
,
that
he
do
not
read
it
with
a
fiddle
in
his
hand
;
which
instrument
he
himself
have
always
have
in
his
own
,
when
he
compose
it
.
  
<EOS>
that
our
work
,
therefore
,
may
be
in
no
danger
of
be
liken
to
the
labour
of
these
historian
,
we
have
take
every
occasion
of
intersperse
through
the
whole
sundry
simile
,
description
,
and
other
kind
of
poetical
embellishment
.
<EOS>
these
be
,
indeed
,
design
to
supply
the
place
of
the
say
ale
,
and
to
refresh
the
mind
,
whenever
those
slumber
,
which
in
a
long
work
be
apt
to
invade
the
reader
as
well
as
the
writer
,
shall
begin
to
creep
upon
him
.
<EOS>
without
interruption
of
this
kind
,
the
good
narrative
of
plain
matter
of
fact
must
overpower
every
reader
;
for
nothing
but
the
ever
last
watchfulness
,
which
Homer
have
ascribe
only
to
jove
himself
,
can
be
proof
against
a
newspaper
of
many
volume
.
  
<EOS>
We
shall
leave
to
the
reader
to
determine
with
what
judgment
we
have
choose
the
several
occasion
for
insert
those
ornamental
part
of
our
work
.
<EOS>
surely
it
will
be
allow
that
none
could
be
more
proper
than
the
present
,
where
we
be
about
to
introduce
a
considerable
character
on
the
scene
;
no
less
,
indeed
,
than
the
heroine
of
this
heroic
,
historical
,
prosaic
poem
.
<EOS>
here
,
therefore
,
we
have
think
proper
to
prepare
the
mind
of
the
reader
for
her
reception
,
by
fill
it
with
every
pleasing
image
which
we
can
draw
from
the
face
of
nature
.
<EOS>
and
for
this
method
we
plead
many
precedent
.
<EOS>
first
,
this
be
an
art
well
know
to
,
and
much
practise
by
,
our
tragick
poet
,
who
seldom
fail
to
prepare
their
audience
for
the
reception
of
their
principal
character
.
  
<EOS>
thus
the
heroe
be
always
introduce
with
a
flourish
of
drum
and
trumpet
,
in
order
to
rouse
a
martial
spirit
in
the
audience
,
and
to
accommodate
their
ear
to
bombast
and
fustian
,
which
Mr
Locke
's
blind
man
would
not
have
grossly
err
in
liken
to
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
.
<EOS>
again
,
when
lover
be
come
forth
,
soft
music
often
conduct
them
on
the
stage
,
either
to
soothe
the
audience
with
the
softness
of
the
tender
passion
,
or
to
lull
and
prepare
them
for
that
gentle
slumber
in
which
they
will
most
probably
be
compose
by
the
ensue
scene
.
  
<EOS>
and
not
only
the
poet
,
but
the
master
of
these
poet
,
the
manager
of
playhouse
,
seem
to
be
in
this
secret
;
for
,
besides
the
aforesaid
kettle
-
drum
,
&
c.
,
which
denote
the
heroe
's
approach
,
he
be
generally
usher
on
the
stage
by
a
large
troop
of
half
a
dozen
scene
-
shifter
;
and
how
necessary
these
be
imagine
to
his
appearance
,
may
be
conclude
from
the
follow
theatrical
story
:
    
<EOS>
King
Pyrrhus
be
at
dinner
at
an
ale
-
house
bordering
on
the
theatre
,
when
he
be
summon
to
go
on
the
stage
.
<EOS>
the
heroe
,
be
unwilling
to
quit
his
shoulder
of
mutton
,
and
as
unwilling
to
draw
on
himself
the
indignation
of
Mr
Wilks
(
his
brother
-
manager
)
for
make
the
audience
wait
,
have
bribe
these
his
harbinger
to
be
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
while
Mr
Wilks
,
therefore
,
be
thunder
out
,
"
where
be
the
carpenter
to
walk
on
before
King
Pyrrhus
?
"
<EOS>
that
monarch
very
quietly
eat
his
mutton
,
and
the
audience
,
however
impatient
,
be
oblige
to
entertain
themselves
with
music
in
his
absence
.
  
<EOS>
to
be
plain
,
I
much
question
whether
the
politician
,
who
hath
generally
a
good
nose
,
hath
not
scent
out
somewhat
of
the
utility
of
this
practice
.
<EOS>
I
be
convinced
that
awful
magistrate
my
lord
-
mayor
contract
a
good
deal
of
that
reverence
which
attend
him
through
the
year
,
by
the
several
pageant
which
precede
his
pomp
.
<EOS>
nay
,
I
must
confess
,
that
even
I
myself
,
who
be
not
remarkably
liable
to
be
captivate
with
show
,
have
yield
not
a
little
to
the
impression
of
much
precede
state
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
see
a
man
strut
in
a
procession
,
after
other
whose
business
be
only
to
walk
before
him
,
I
have
conceive
a
high
notion
of
his
dignity
than
I
have
feel
on
see
him
in
a
common
situation
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
one
instance
,
which
come
exactly
up
to
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
custom
of
send
on
a
basket
-
woman
,
who
be
to
precede
the
pomp
at
a
coronation
,
and
to
strew
the
stage
with
flower
,
before
the
great
personage
begin
their
procession
.
<EOS>
the
antient
would
certainly
have
invoke
the
goddess
Flora
for
this
purpose
,
and
it
would
have
be
no
difficulty
for
their
priest
,
or
politician
to
have
persuade
the
people
of
the
real
presence
of
the
deity
,
though
a
plain
mortal
have
personate
her
and
perform
her
office
.
<EOS>
but
we
have
no
such
design
of
impose
on
our
reader
;
and
therefore
those
who
object
to
the
heathen
theology
,
may
,
if
they
please
,
change
our
goddess
into
the
above
-
mention
basket
-
woman
.
<EOS>
Our
intention
,
in
short
,
be
to
introduce
our
heroine
with
the
utmost
solemnity
in
our
power
,
with
an
elevation
of
stile
,
and
all
other
circumstance
proper
to
raise
the
veneration
of
our
reader
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
we
would
,
for
certain
cause
,
advise
those
of
our
male
reader
who
have
any
heart
,
to
read
no
farther
,
be
we
not
well
assured
,
that
how
amiable
soever
the
picture
of
our
heroine
will
appear
,
as
it
be
really
a
copy
from
nature
,
many
of
our
fair
countrywoman
will
be
find
worthy
to
satisfy
any
passion
,
and
to
answer
any
idea
of
female
perfection
which
our
pencil
will
be
able
to
raise
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
without
any
further
preface
,
we
proceed
to
our
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
a
short
hint
of
what
we
can
do
in
the
sublime
,
and
a
description
of
Miss
Sophia
Western
.
 
<EOS>
Hushed
be
every
ruder
breath
.
<EOS>
May
the
heathen
ruler
of
the
winds
confine
in
iron
chain
the
boisterous
limb
of
noisy
Boreas
,
and
the
sharp
-
pointed
nose
of
bitter
-
bite
Eurus
.
<EOS>
do
thou
,
sweet
Zephyrus
,
rise
from
thy
fragrant
bed
,
mount
the
western
sky
,
and
lead
on
those
delicious
gale
,
the
charm
of
which
call
forth
the
lovely
Flora
from
her
chamber
,
perfume
with
pearly
dew
,
when
on
the
1st
of
June
,
her
birth
-
day
,
the
blooming
maid
,
in
loose
attire
,
gently
trip
it
over
the
verdant
mead
,
where
every
flower
rise
to
do
her
homage
,
till
the
whole
field
become
enamel
,
and
colour
contend
with
sweet
which
shall
ravish
her
most
.
  
<EOS>
so
charming
may
she
now
appear
!
<EOS>
and
you
the
feather
chorister
of
nature
,
whose
sweetest
note
not
even
Handel
can
excell
,
tune
your
melodious
throat
to
celebrate
her
appearance
.
<EOS>
from
love
proceed
your
music
,
and
to
love
it
return
.
<EOS>
Awaken
therefore
that
gentle
passion
in
every
swain
:
for
lo
!
<EOS>
adorn
with
all
the
charm
in
which
nature
can
array
her
;
bedeck
with
beauty
,
youth
,
sprightliness
,
innocence
,
modesty
,
and
tenderness
,
breathe
sweetness
from
her
rosy
lip
,
and
dart
brightness
from
her
sparkling
eye
,
the
lovely
Sophia
come
!
  
<EOS>
reader
,
perhaps
thou
hast
see
the
statue
of
the
Venus
de
Medicis
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
too
,
thou
hast
see
the
gallery
of
beauty
at
Hampton
Court
.
<EOS>
Thou
may'st
remember
each
bright
Churchill
of
the
galaxy
,
and
all
the
toast
of
the
kit
-
cat
.
<EOS>
or
,
if
their
reign
be
before
thy
time
,
at
least
thou
hast
see
their
daughter
,
the
no
less
dazzling
beauty
of
the
present
age
;
whose
name
,
should
we
here
insert
<EOS>
,
we
apprehend
they
would
fill
the
whole
volume
.
  
<EOS>
now
if
thou
hast
see
all
these
,
be
not
afraid
of
the
rude
answer
which
Lord
Rochester
once
give
to
a
man
who
have
see
many
thing
.
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
if
thou
hast
see
all
these
without
know
what
beauty
be
,
thou
hast
<EOS>
no
eye
;
if
without
feel
its
power
,
thou
hast
no
heart
.
  
<EOS>
yet
be
it
possible
,
my
friend
,
that
thou
mayest
have
see
all
these
without
be
able
to
form
an
exact
idea
of
Sophia
;
for
she
do
not
exactly
resemble
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
She
be
most
like
the
picture
of
Lady
Ranelagh
:
<EOS>
and
,
I
have
hear
,
more
still
to
the
famous
dutchess
of
Mazarine
;
but
most
of
all
she
resemble
one
whose
image
never
can
depart
from
my
breast
,
and
whom
,
if
thou
dost
remember
,
thou
hast
then
,
my
friend
,
an
adequate
idea
of
Sophia
.
  
<EOS>
but
lest
this
should
not
have
be
thy
fortune
,
we
will
endeavour
with
our
utmost
skill
to
describe
this
paragon
,
though
we
be
sensible
that
our
high
ability
be
very
inadequate
to
the
task
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
,
then
,
the
only
daughter
of
Mr
Western
,
be
a
middle
-
sized
woman
;
but
rather
incline
to
tall
.
<EOS>
Her
shape
be
not
only
exact
,
but
extremely
delicate
:
and
the
nice
proportion
of
her
arm
promise
the
true
symmetry
in
her
limb
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
,
which
be
black
,
be
so
luxuriant
,
that
it
reach
her
middle
,
before
she
cut
it
to
comply
with
the
modern
fashion
;
and
it
be
now
curl
so
gracefully
in
her
neck
,
that
few
could
believe
it
to
be
her
own
.
<EOS>
if
envy
could
find
any
part
of
the
face
which
demand
less
commendation
than
the
rest
,
it
may
possibly
think
her
forehead
may
have
be
high
without
prejudice
to
her
.
<EOS>
Her
eyebrow
be
full
,
even
,
and
arch
beyond
the
power
of
art
to
imitate
.
<EOS>
Her
black
eye
have
a
lustre
in
them
,
which
all
her
softness
could
not
extinguish
.
<EOS>
Her
nose
be
exactly
regular
,
and
her
mouth
,
in
which
be
two
row
of
ivory
,
exactly
answer
Sir
John
Suckling
's
description
in
those
line
:
          
Her
lip
be
red
,
and
one
be
thin
,
      
Compar'd
to
that
be
next
her
chin
.
         
<EOS>
some
bee
have
sting
it
newly
.
  
<EOS>
Her
cheek
be
of
the
oval
kind
;
and
in
her
right
<EOS>
she
have
a
dimple
,
which
the
least
smile
discover
.
<EOS>
Her
chin
have
certainly
its
share
in
form
the
beauty
of
her
face
;
but
it
be
difficult
to
say
it
be
either
large
or
small
,
though
perhaps
it
be
rather
of
the
former
kind
.
<EOS>
Her
complexion
have
rather
more
of
the
lily
than
of
the
rose
;
but
when
exercise
or
modesty
increase
her
natural
colour
,
no
vermilion
could
equal
it
.
<EOS>
then
one
may
indeed
cry
out
with
the
celebrated
Dr
Donne
:
         
H
er
<EOS>
pure
and
eloquent
blood
     
<EOS>
Spoke
in
her
cheek
,
and
so
distinctly
work
     
<EOS>
that
one
may
almost
say
her
body
think
.
  
<EOS>
Her
neck
be
long
and
finely
turn
:
and
here
,
if
I
be
not
afraid
of
offend
her
delicacy
,
I
may
justly
say
,
the
high
beauty
of
the
famous
Venus
de
Medicis
be
outdo
.
<EOS>
here
be
whiteness
which
no
lily
,
ivory
,
nor
alabaster
could
match
.
<EOS>
the
fine
cambric
may
indeed
be
suppose
from
envy
to
cover
that
bosom
which
be
much
white
than
itself
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
,
  
Nitor
splenden
Pario
marmore
purius
.
       
<EOS>
a
gloss
shine
beyond
the
pure
brightness
of
parian
marble
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
outside
of
Sophia
;
nor
be
this
beautiful
frame
disgrace
by
an
inhabitant
unworthy
of
it
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
be
every
way
equal
to
her
person
;
nay
,
the
latter
borrow
some
charm
from
the
former
;
for
when
she
smile
,
the
sweetness
of
her
temper
diffuse
that
glory
over
her
countenance
which
no
regularity
of
feature
can
give
.
<EOS>
but
as
there
be
no
perfection
of
the
mind
which
do
not
discover
themselves
in
that
perfect
intimacy
to
which
we
intend
to
introduce
our
reader
with
this
charming
young
creature
,
so
it
be
needless
to
mention
them
here
:
nay
,
it
be
a
kind
of
tacit
affront
to
our
reader
's
understanding
,
and
may
also
rob
him
of
that
pleasure
which
he
will
receive
in
form
his
own
judgment
of
her
character
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
,
however
,
be
proper
to
say
,
that
whatever
mental
accomplishment
she
have
derive
from
nature
,
they
be
somewhat
improve
and
cultivate
by
art
:
for
she
have
be
educate
under
the
care
of
an
aunt
,
who
be
a
lady
of
great
discretion
,
and
be
thoroughly
acquaint
with
the
world
,
have
live
in
her
youth
about
the
court
,
<EOS>
whence
she
have
retire
some
year
since
into
the
country
.
<EOS>
by
her
conversation
and
instruction
,
Sophia
be
perfectly
well
breed
,
though
perhaps
she
want
a
little
of
that
ease
in
her
behaviour
which
be
to
be
acquire
only
by
habit
,
and
live
within
what
be
call
the
polite
circle
.
<EOS>
but
this
,
to
say
the
truth
,
be
often
too
dearly
purchase
;
and
though
it
hath
charm
so
inexpressible
,
that
the
French
,
perhaps
,
among
other
quality
,
mean
to
express
this
,
when
they
declare
they
know
not
what
it
be
;
yet
its
absence
be
well
compensate
by
innocence
;
nor
can
good
sense
and
a
natural
gentility
ever
stand
in
need
of
it
.
    
<EOS>
wherein
the
history
go
back
to
commemorate
a
trifling
incident
that
happen
some
year
since
;
but
which
,
trifle
as
it
be
,
have
some
future
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
the
amiable
Sophia
be
now
in
her
eighteenth
year
,
when
she
be
introduce
into
this
history
.
<EOS>
Her
father
,
as
hath
be
say
,
be
fonder
of
her
than
of
any
other
human
creature
.
<EOS>
to
her
,
therefore
,
Tom
Jones
apply
,
in
order
to
engage
her
interest
on
the
behalf
of
his
friend
the
gamekeeper
.
  
<EOS>
but
before
we
proceed
to
this
business
,
a
short
recapitulation
of
some
previous
matter
may
be
necessary
.
  
<EOS>
though
the
different
temper
of
Mr
Allworthy
and
of
Mr
Western
do
not
admit
of
a
very
intimate
correspondence
,
yet
they
live
upon
what
be
call
a
decent
footing
together
;
by
which
mean
the
young
people
of
both
family
have
be
acquaint
from
their
infancy
;
and
as
they
be
all
near
of
the
same
age
,
have
be
frequent
playmate
together
.
  
<EOS>
the
gaiety
of
Tom
's
temper
suit
better
with
Sophia
,
than
the
grave
and
sober
disposition
of
Master
Blifil
.
<EOS>
and
the
preference
which
she
give
the
former
of
these
,
would
often
appear
so
plainly
,
that
a
lad
of
a
more
passionate
turn
than
Master
Blifil
be
,
may
have
show
some
displeasure
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
do
not
,
however
,
outwardly
express
any
such
disgust
,
it
would
be
an
ill
office
in
us
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
inmost
recess
of
his
mind
,
as
some
scandalous
people
search
into
the
most
secret
affair
of
their
friend
,
and
often
pry
into
their
closet
and
cupboard
,
only
to
discover
their
poverty
and
meanness
to
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
as
person
who
suspect
they
have
give
other
cause
of
offence
,
be
apt
to
conclude
they
be
offend
;
so
Sophia
impute
an
action
of
Master
Blifil
to
his
anger
,
which
the
superior
sagacity
of
Thwackum
and
Square
discern
to
have
arise
from
a
much
well
principle
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
Jones
,
when
very
young
,
have
present
Sophia
with
a
little
bird
,
which
he
have
take
from
the
nest
,
have
nurse
up
,
and
teach
to
sing
.
  
<EOS>
of
this
bird
,
Sophia
,
then
about
thirteen
year
old
,
be
so
extremely
fond
,
that
her
chief
business
be
to
feed
and
tend
it
,
and
her
chief
pleasure
to
play
with
it
.
<EOS>
by
these
mean
little
Tommy
,
for
so
the
bird
be
call
,
be
become
so
tame
,
that
it
would
feed
out
of
the
hand
of
its
mistress
,
would
perch
upon
the
finger
,
and
lie
contented
in
her
bosom
,
where
it
seem
almost
sensible
of
its
own
happiness
;
though
she
always
keep
a
small
string
about
its
leg
,
nor
would
ever
trust
it
with
the
liberty
of
fly
away
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
,
when
Mr
Allworthy
and
his
whole
family
dine
at
Mr
Western
's
,
Master
Blifil
,
be
in
the
garden
with
little
Sophia
,
and
observe
the
extreme
fondness
that
she
show
for
her
little
bird
,
desire
her
to
trust
it
for
a
moment
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Sophia
presently
comply
with
the
young
gentleman
's
request
,
and
after
some
previous
caution
,
deliver
him
her
bird
;
of
which
he
be
no
sooner
in
possession
,
than
he
slipt
the
string
from
its
leg
and
toss
it
into
the
air
.
  
<EOS>
the
foolish
animal
no
sooner
perceive
itself
at
liberty
,
than
forget
all
the
favour
it
have
receive
from
Sophia
,
it
fly
directly
from
her
,
and
perch
on
a
bough
at
some
distance
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
,
see
her
bird
go
,
scream
out
so
loud
,
that
Tom
Jones
,
who
be
at
a
little
distance
,
immediately
run
to
her
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
informed
of
what
have
happen
,
than
he
curse
Blifil
for
a
pitiful
malicious
rascal
;
and
then
immediately
strip
off
his
coat
<EOS>
he
apply
himself
to
climb
the
tree
to
which
the
bird
escape
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
have
almost
recover
his
little
namesake
,
when
the
branch
on
which
it
be
perch
,
and
that
hang
over
a
canal
,
break
,
and
the
poor
lad
plump
over
head
and
ear
into
the
water
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
's
concern
now
change
its
object
.
<EOS>
and
as
she
apprehend
the
boy
's
life
be
in
danger
,
she
scream
ten
time
louder
than
before
;
and
indeed
Master
Blifil
himself
now
second
her
with
all
the
vociferation
in
his
power
.
  
<EOS>
the
company
,
who
be
sit
in
a
room
next
the
garden
,
be
instantly
alarm
,
and
come
all
forth
;
but
just
as
they
reach
the
canal
,
<EOS>
Tom
(
for
the
water
be
luckily
pretty
shallow
in
that
part
)
arrive
safely
on
shore
.
  
<EOS>
Thwackum
fall
violently
on
poor
Tom
,
who
stand
drop
and
shiver
before
him
,
when
Mr
Allworthy
desire
him
to
have
patience
;
and
turn
to
Master
Blifil
,
say
,
"
pray
,
child
<EOS>
,
what
be
the
reason
of
all
this
disturbance
?
"
  
<EOS>
Master
Blifil
answer
,
"
indeed
,
uncle
,
I
be
very
sorry
for
what
I
have
do
;
I
have
be
unhappily
the
occasion
of
it
all
.
<EOS>
I
have
Miss
Sophia
's
bird
in
my
hand
,
and
think
the
poor
creature
languish
for
liberty
<EOS>
,
I
own
I
could
not
forbear
give
it
what
it
desire
;
for
I
always
think
there
be
something
very
cruel
in
confine
anything
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
be
against
the
law
of
nature
,
by
which
everything
hath
a
right
to
liberty
;
nay
,
it
be
even
unchristian
,
for
it
be
not
do
what
we
would
be
do
by
;
but
if
I
have
imagine
Miss
Sophia
would
have
be
so
much
concerned
at
it
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
I
never
would
have
do
it
;
nay
,
if
I
have
know
what
would
have
happen
to
the
bird
itself
:
for
when
Master
Jones
,
who
climb
up
that
tree
after
it
,
fall
into
the
water
,
the
bird
take
a
second
flight
,
and
presently
a
nasty
hawk
carry
it
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Sophia
,
who
now
first
hear
of
her
little
Tommy
's
fate
(
for
her
concern
for
Jones
have
prevent
her
perceive
it
when
it
happen
)
,
shed
a
shower
of
tear
.
<EOS>
these
Mr
Allworthy
endeavour
to
assuage
,
promise
her
a
much
fine
bird
:
but
she
declare
she
would
never
have
another
.
<EOS>
Her
father
chide
her
for
cry
so
for
a
foolish
bird
;
but
could
not
help
tell
young
Blifil
,
if
he
be
a
son
of
his
,
his
backside
should
be
well
flead
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
now
return
to
her
chamber
,
the
two
young
gentleman
be
send
home
,
and
the
rest
of
the
company
return
to
their
bottle
;
where
a
conversation
ensue
on
the
subject
of
the
bird
,
so
curious
,
that
we
think
it
deserve
a
chapter
by
itself
.
    
<EOS>
contain
such
very
deep
and
grave
matter
,
that
some
reader
,
perhaps
,
may
not
relish
it
.
 
<EOS>
Square
have
no
sooner
light
his
pipe
,
than
,
address
himself
to
Allworthy
<EOS>
,
he
thus
begin
:
"
Sir
,
I
can
not
help
congratulate
you
on
your
nephew
;
who
,
at
an
age
when
few
lad
have
any
idea
but
of
sensible
object
,
be
arrive
at
a
capacity
of
distinguish
right
from
wrong
.
<EOS>
to
confine
anything
,
seem
to
me
against
the
law
of
nature
,
by
which
everything
hath
a
right
to
liberty
.
<EOS>
these
be
his
word
;
and
the
impression
they
have
make
on
me
be
never
to
be
eradicate
.
<EOS>
Can
any
man
have
a
high
notion
of
the
rule
of
right
,
and
the
eternal
fitness
of
thing
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
promise
myself
,
from
such
a
dawn
,
that
the
meridian
of
this
youth
will
be
equal
to
that
of
either
the
elder
or
the
young
Brutus
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
Thwackum
hastily
interrupt
,
and
spill
some
of
his
wine
,
and
swallow
the
rest
with
great
eagerness
,
answer
,
"
from
another
expression
he
make
use
of
,
I
hope
he
will
resemble
much
well
man
.
<EOS>
the
law
of
nature
be
a
jargon
of
word
,
which
mean
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
of
any
such
law
,
nor
of
any
right
which
can
be
derive
from
it
.
<EOS>
to
do
as
we
would
be
do
by
,
be
indeed
a
christian
motive
,
as
the
boy
well
express
himself
;
and
I
be
glad
to
find
my
instruction
have
bear
such
good
fruit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
vanity
be
a
thing
fit
,
"
say
Square
,
"
I
may
indulge
some
on
the
same
occasion
;
for
whence
only
he
can
have
learn
his
notion
of
right
or
wrong
,
I
think
be
pretty
apparent
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
no
law
of
nature
,
there
be
no
right
nor
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how

"
say
the
parson
,
"
do
you
then
banish
revelation
?

I
talk
with
a
deist

an
atheist

western

"
<EOS>
Pox
of
your
law
of
nature

<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
you
mean
,
either
of
you
,
by
right
and
wrong
.
<EOS>
to
take
away
my
girl
's
bird
be
wrong
,
in
my
opinion
;
and
my
neighbour
Allworthy
may
do
as
he
please
;
but
to
encourage
boy
in
such
practice
,
be
to
breed
them
up
to
the
gallow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
answer
,
"
that
he
be
sorry
for
what
his
nephew
have
do
,
but
could
not
consent
to
punish
him
,
as
he
act
rather
from
a
generous
than
unworthy
motive
.
"
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
if
the
boy
have
steal
the
bird
,
none
would
have
be
more
ready
to
vote
for
a
severe
chastisement
than
himself
;
but
it
be
plain
that
be
not
his
design
:
"
and
,
indeed
,
it
be
as
apparent
to
him
,
that
he
could
have
no
other
view
but
what
he
have
<EOS>
himself
avow
.
<EOS>
(
for
as
to
that
malicious
purpose
which
Sophia
suspect
,
it
never
once
enter
into
the
head
of
Mr
Allworthy
.
)
<EOS>
He
at
length
conclude
with
again
blame
the
action
as
inconsiderate
,
and
which
,
he
say
,
be
pardonable
only
in
a
child
.
  
<EOS>
Square
have
deliver
his
opinion
so
openly
,
that
if
he
be
now
silent
,
he
must
submit
to
have
his
judgment
censure
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
therefore
,
with
some
warmth
,
"
that
Mr
Allworthy
have
too
much
respect
to
the
dirty
consideration
of
property
.
<EOS>
that
in
pass
our
judgment
on
great
and
mighty
action
,
all
private
regard
should
be
lay
aside
;
for
by
adhere
to
those
narrow
rule

the
young
Brutus
have
be
condemn
of
ingratitude
,

the
elder
of
parricide

<EOS>
"
and
if
they
have
be

too

those
crime

cry
Thwackum

they

Heaven

<EOS>
I
wish

Mr

you
would
desist
from

the

<EOS>
I

<EOS>

do
not

He

"
  
<EOS>
Thwackum
put
on
a
contemptuous
sneer
at
this
,
and
reply
,
"

I

"
<EOS>
what

the
sublime
idea
of
virtue
could
inspire
a
human
mind

generous

I
repeat
to
you
again
,
if

I
may
claim

<EOS>
"

say
Thwackum

"
I
may
boast
of

cry
out

Mr

<EOS>

"
  
<EOS>
the
lawyer
with
great
gravity
deliver
himself
as
follow
:
    
<EOS>
"
if
the
case
be
put
of
a
partridge
,
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
an
action
would
lie
;
for
though
this
be
ferae
naturae
,
yet
be
reclaim
,
property
vest
:
but
be
the
case
of
a
singing
bird
,
though
reclaim
,
as
it
be
a
thing
of
base
nature
,
it
must
be
consider
as
nullius
in
bonis

<EOS>
in
this
case
,
therefore
,
I
conceive
the
plaintiff
must
be
non

suited
;

I
should
disadvise
the
bringing
any
such
action

<EOS>
"

well

the

me
,
here
be
Tom
's
health
!
<EOS>
I
shall
love
the
boy
for
it
the
long
day
I
have
to
live
.
"
  
<EOS>
thus
be
the
debate
interrupt
;
but
it
would
probably
have
be
soon
resume
,
have
not
Mr
Allworthy
presently
call
for
his
coach
,
and
carry
off
the
two
combatant
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
conclusion
of
this
adventure
of
the
bird
,
and
of
the
dialogue
occasion
by
it
;
which
we
could
not
help
recount
to
our
reader
,
though
it
happen
some
year
before
that
stage
or
period
of
time
at
which
our
history
be
now
arrive
.
    
<EOS>
contain
matter
accommodate
to
every
taste
.
 
<EOS>
"
Parva
leve
capiunt
animos
 
<EOS>
small
thing
affect
light
mind
,
"
be
the
sentiment
of
a
great
master
of
the
passion
of
love
.
<EOS>
and
certain
it
be
,
that
from
this
day
Sophia
begin
to
have
some
little
kindness
for
Tom
Jones
,
and
no
little
aversion
for
his
companion
.
  
<EOS>
many
accident
from
time
to
time
improve
both
these
passion
in
her
breast
;
which
,
without
our
recounting
,
the
reader
may
well
conclude
,
from
what
we
have
before
hint
of
the
different
temper
of
these
lad
,
and
how
much
the
one
suit
with
her
own
inclination
more
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
Sophia
,
when
very
young
,
discern
that
Tom
,
though
an
idle
,
thoughtless
,
rattle
rascal
,
be
nobody
's
enemy
but
his
own
;
and
that
Master
Blifil
,
though
a
prudent
,
discreet
,
sober
young
gentleman
,
be
at
the
same
time
strongly
attach
to
the
interest
only
of
one
single
person
;
and
who
that
single
person
be
the
reader
will
be
able
to
divine
without
any
assistance
of
ours
.
  
<EOS>
these
two
character
be
not
always
receive
in
the
world
with
the
different
regard
which
seem
severally
due
to
either
;
and
which
one
would
imagine
mankind
,
from
self
-
interest
,
should
show
towards
them
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
there
may
be
a
political
reason
for
it
:
in
find
one
of
a
truly
benevolent
disposition
,
man
may
very
reasonably
suppose
they
have
find
a
treasure
,
and
be
desirous
of
keep
it
,
like
all
other
good
thing
,
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
hence
they
may
imagine
,
that
to
trumpet
forth
the
praise
of
such
a
person
,
would
,
in
the
vulgar
phrase
,
be
cry
roast
-
meat
,
and
call
in
partaker
of
what
they
intend
to
apply
solely
to
their
own
use
.
<EOS>
if
this
reason
do
not
satisfy
the
reader
,
I
know
no
other
mean
of
account
for
the
little
respect
which
I
have
commonly
see
pay
to
a
character
which
really
do
great
honour
to
human
nature
,
and
be
productive
of
the
high
good
to
society
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
otherwise
with
Sophia
.
<EOS>
She
honour
Tom
Jones
,
and
scorn
Master
Blifil
,
almost
as
soon
as
she
know
the
meaning
of
those
two
word
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
have
be
absent
upward
of
three
year
with
her
aunt
;
during
all
which
time
she
have
seldom
see
either
of
these
young
gentleman
.
<EOS>
She
dine
,
however
,
once
,
together
with
her
aunt
,
at
Mr
Allworthy
's
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
few
day
after
the
adventure
of
the
partridge
,
before
commemorate
.
<EOS>
Sophia
hear
the
whole
story
at
table
,
where
she
say
nothing
:
nor
indeed
could
her
aunt
get
many
word
from
her
as
she
return
home
;
but
her
maid
,
when
undress
her
,
happen
to
say
,
"
well
,
miss
,
I
suppose
you
have
see
young
Master
Blifil
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
answer
with
much
passion
,
"
I
hate
the
name
of
Master
Blifil
,
as
I
do
whatever
be
base
and
treacherous
:
and
I
wonder
Mr
Allworthy
would
suffer
that
old
barbarous
schoolmaster
to
punish
a
poor
boy
so
cruelly
for
what
be
only
the
effect
of
his
good
-
nature
.
"
<EOS>
She
then
recount
the
story
to
her
maid
,
and
conclude
with
say
,
"
do
not
you
think
he
be
a
boy
of
noble
spirit
?
"
  
<EOS>
this
young
lady
be
now
return
to
her
father
;
who
give
her
the
command
of
his
house
,
and
place
her
at
the
upper
end
of
his
table
,
where
Tom
(
who
for
his
great
love
of
hunting
be
become
a
great
favourite
of
the
squire
)
often
dine
.
<EOS>
young
man
of
open
,
generous
disposition
be
naturally
incline
to
gallantry
,
which
,
if
they
have
good
understanding
,
as
be
in
reality
<EOS>
Tom
's
case
,
exert
itself
in
an
obliging
complacent
behaviour
to
all
woman
in
general
.
<EOS>
this
greatly
distinguish
Tom
from
the
boisterous
brutality
of
mere
country
squire
on
the
one
hand
,
and
from
the
solemn
and
somewhat
sullen
deportment
of
Master
Blifil
on
the
other
;
and
he
begin
now
,
at
twenty
,
to
have
the
name
of
a
pretty
fellow
among
all
the
woman
in
the
neighbourhood
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
behave
to
Sophia
with
no
particularity
,
unless
perhaps
by
show
her
a
high
respect
than
he
pay
to
any
other
.
<EOS>
this
distinction
her
beauty
,
fortune
,
sense
,
and
amiable
carriage
,
seem
to
demand
;
but
as
to
design
upon
her
person
he
have
none
;
for
which
we
shall
at
present
suffer
the
reader
to
condemn
him
of
stupidity
;
but
perhaps
we
shall
be
able
indifferently
well
to
account
for
it
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
,
with
the
high
degree
of
innocence
and
modesty
,
have
a
remarkable
sprightliness
in
her
temper
.
<EOS>
this
be
so
greatly
increase
whenever
she
be
in
company
with
Tom
,
that
have
he
not
be
very
young
and
thoughtless
,
he
must
have
observe
it
:
or
have
not
Mr
Western
's
thought
be
generally
either
in
the
field
,
the
stable
,
or
the
dog
-
kennel
,
it
may
have
perhaps
create
some
jealousy
in
him
:
but
so
far
be
the
good
gentleman
from
entertain
any
such
suspicion
,
that
he
give
Tom
every
opportunity
with
his
daughter
which
any
lover
could
have
wish
;
and
this
Tom
innocently
improve
to
well
advantage
,
by
follow
only
the
dictate
of
his
natural
gallantry
and
good
-
nature
,
than
he
may
perhaps
have
do
<EOS>
have
he
have
the
deep
design
on
the
young
lady
.
  
<EOS>
but
indeed
it
can
occasion
little
wonder
that
this
matter
escape
the
observation
of
other
,
since
poor
Sophia
herself
never
remark
it
;
and
her
heart
be
irretrievably
lose
before
she
suspect
it
be
in
danger
.
  
<EOS>
matter
be
in
this
situation
,
when
Tom
,
one
afternoon
,
find
Sophia
alone
,
begin
,
after
a
short
apology
,
with
a
very
serious
face
,
to
acquaint
her
that
he
have
a
favour
to
ask
of
her
which
he
hope
her
goodness
would
comply
with
.
  
<EOS>
though
neither
the
young
man
's
behaviour
,
nor
indeed
his
manner
of
open
this
business
,
be
such
as
could
give
her
any
just
cause
of
suspect
he
intend
to
make
love
to
her
;
yet
whether
Nature
whisper
something
into
her
ear
,
or
from
what
cause
<EOS>
it
arise
I
will
not
determine
;
certain
it
be
,
some
idea
of
that
kind
must
have
intrude
itself
;
for
her
colour
forsook
her
cheek
,
her
limb
tremble
,
and
her
tongue
would
have
falter
,
have
Tom
stop
for
an
answer
;
but
he
soon
relieve
her
from
her
perplexity
,
by
proceed
to
inform
her
of
his
request
;
which
be
to
solicit
her
interest
on
behalf
of
the
gamekeeper
,
whose
own
ruin
,
and
that
of
a
large
family
,
must
be
,
he
say
,
the
consequence
of
Mr
Western
's
pursue
his
action
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
presently
recover
her
confusion
,
and
,
with
a
smile
full
of
sweetness
,
say
,
"
be
this
the
mighty
favour
you
ask
with
so
much
gravity
?
<EOS>
I
will
do
it
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
really
pity
the
poor
fellow
,
and
no
longer
ago
than
yesterday
send
a
small
matter
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
this
small
matter
be
one
of
her
gown
,
some
linen
,
and
ten
shilling
in
money
,
of
which
Tom
have
hear
,
and
it
have
,
in
reality
,
put
this
solicitation
into
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
Our
youth
,
now
,
embolden
with
his
success
,
resolve
to
push
the
matter
farther
,
and
venture
even
to
beg
her
recommendation
of
him
to
her
father
's
service
;
protest
that
he
think
him
one
of
the
honest
fellow
in
the
country
,
and
extremely
well
qualified
for
the
place
of
a
gamekeeper
,
which
luckily
then
happen
to
be
vacant
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
answer
,
"
well
,
I
will
undertake
this
too
;
but
I
can
not
promise
you
as
much
success
as
in
the
former
part
,
which
I
assure
you
I
will
not
quit
my
father
without
obtain
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
will
do
what
I
can
for
the
poor
fellow
;
for
I
sincerely
look
upon
him
and
his
family
as
object
of
great
compassion
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
Mr
Jones
,
I
must
ask
you
a
favour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
favour
,
madam
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Tom
:
"
if
you
know
the
pleasure
you
have
give
me
in
the
hope
of
receive
a
command
from
you
,
you
would
think
by
mention
it
you
do
confer
the
great
favour
on
me
;
for
by
this
dear
hand
I
would
sacrifice
my
life
to
oblige
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
then
snatch
her
hand
,
and
eagerly
kiss
it
,
which
be
the
first
time
his
lip
have
ever
touch
her
.
<EOS>
the
blood
,
which
before
have
forsake
her
cheek
,
now
make
her
sufficient
amend
,
by
rush
all
over
her
face
and
neck
with
such
violence
,
that
they
become
all
of
a
scarlet
colour
.
<EOS>
She
now
first
feel
a
sensation
to
which
she
have
be
before
a
stranger
,
and
which
,
when
she
have
leisure
to
reflect
on
it
,
begin
to
acquaint
her
with
some
secret
,
which
the
reader
,
if
he
doth
not
already
guess
them
,
will
know
in
due
time
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
,
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
(
which
be
not
instantly
)
,
inform
him
that
the
favour
she
have
to
desire
of
him
be
,
not
to
lead
her
father
through
so
many
danger
in
hunting
;
for
that
,
from
what
she
have
hear
,
she
be
terribly
frightened
every
time
they
go
out
together
,
and
expect
some
day
or
other
to
see
her
father
bring
home
with
break
limb
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
beg
him
,
for
her
sake
,
to
be
more
cautious
;
and
as
he
well
know
Mr
Western
would
follow
him
,
not
to
ride
so
madly
,
nor
to
take
those
dangerous
leap
for
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
promise
faithfully
to
obey
her
command
;
and
after
thank
her
for
her
kind
compliance
with
his
request
,
take
his
leave
,
and
depart
highly
charm
with
his
success
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Sophia
be
charm
too
,
but
in
a
very
different
way
.
<EOS>
Her
sensation
,
however
,
the
reader
's
heart
(
if
he
or
she
have
any
)
will
better
represent
than
I
can
,
if
I
have
as
many
mouth
as
ever
poet
wish
for
,
to
eat
,
I
suppose
,
those
many
dainty
with
which
he
be
so
plentifully
provide
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
Mr
Western
's
custom
every
afternoon
,
as
soon
as
he
be
drunk
,
to
hear
his
daughter
play
on
the
harpsichord
;
for
he
be
a
great
lover
of
music
,
and
perhaps
,
have
he
live
in
town
,
may
have
pass
for
a
connoisseur
;
for
he
always
except
against
the
fine
composition
of
Mr
Handel
.
<EOS>
He
never
relish
any
music
but
what
be
light
and
airy
;
and
indeed
his
most
favourite
tune
be
Old
Sir
Simon
the
King
,
St
George
<EOS>
he
be
for
England
,
Bobbing
Joan
,
and
some
other
.
  
<EOS>
His
daughter
,
though
she
be
a
perfect
mistress
of
music
,
and
would
never
willingly
have
play
any
but
Handel
's
,
be
so
devoted
to
her
father
's
pleasure
,
that
she
learn
all
those
tune
to
oblige
him
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
would
now
and
then
endeavour
to
lead
him
into
her
own
taste
;
and
when
he
require
the
repetition
of
his
ballad
,
would
answer
with
a
"
Nay
,
dear
sir
;
"
and
would
often
beg
him
to
suffer
her
to
play
something
else
.
  
<EOS>
this
evening
,
however
,
when
the
gentleman
be
retire
from
his
bottle
,
she
play
all
his
favourite
three
time
over
without
any
solicitation
.
<EOS>
this
so
please
the
good
squire
,
that
he
start
from
his
couch
,
give
his
daughter
a
kiss
,
and
swear
her
hand
be
greatly
improve
.
<EOS>
She
take
this
opportunity
to
execute
her
promise
to
Tom
;
in
which
she
succeed
so
well
,
that
the
squire
declare
,
if
she
would
give
him
t'other
bout
of
Old
Sir
Simon
,
he
would
give
the
gamekeeper
his
deputation
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
Sir
Simon
be
play
again
and
again
,
till
the
charm
of
the
music
soothe
Mr
Western
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
in
the
morning
Sophia
do
not
fail
to
remind
him
of
his
engagement
;
and
his
attorney
be
immediately
send
for
,
order
to
stop
any
further
proceeding
in
the
action
,
and
to
make
out
the
deputation
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
's
success
in
this
affair
soon
begin
to
ring
over
the
country
,
and
various
be
the
censure
pass
upon
it
;
some
greatly
applaud
it
as
an
act
of
good
nature
;
other
sneer
,
and
say
,
"
<EOS>
no
wonder
that
one
idle
fellow
should
love
another
.
"
<EOS>
Young
Blifil
be
greatly
enrage
at
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
long
hate
Black
George
in
the
same
proportion
as
Jones
delight
in
him
;
not
from
any
offence
which
he
have
ever
receive
,
but
from
his
great
love
to
religion
and
virtue
;
 
for
Black
George
have
the
reputation
of
a
loose
kind
of
a
fellow
.
<EOS>
Blifil
therefore
represent
this
as
fly
in
Mr
Allworthy
's
face
;
and
declare
,
with
great
concern
,
that
it
be
impossible
to
find
any
other
motive
for
do
good
to
such
a
wretch
.
  
<EOS>
Thwackum
and
Square
likewise
sing
to
the
same
tune
.
<EOS>
They
be
now
(
especially
the
latter
)
become
greatly
jealous
of
young
Jones
with
the
widow
;
for
he
now
approach
the
age
of
twenty
,
be
really
a
fine
young
fellow
,
and
that
lady
,
by
her
encouragement
to
him
,
seem
daily
more
and
more
to
think
him
so
.
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
be
not
,
however
,
move
with
their
malice
.
<EOS>
He
declare
himself
very
well
satisfied
with
what
Jones
have
do
.
<EOS>
He
say
the
perseverance
and
integrity
of
his
friendship
be
highly
commendable
,
and
he
wish
he
could
see
more
frequent
instance
of
that
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
but
Fortune
,
who
seldom
greatly
relish
such
spark
as
my
friend
Tom
,
perhaps
because
they
do
not
pay
more
ardent
address
to
her
,
give
now
a
very
different
turn
to
all
his
action
,
and
show
them
to
Mr
Allworthy
in
a
light
far
less
agreeable
than
that
gentleman
's
goodness
have
hitherto
see
them
in
.
    
<EOS>
an
apology
for
the
insensibility
of
Mr
Jones
to
all
the
charm
of
the
lovely
Sophia
;
in
which
possibly
we
may
,
in
a
considerable
degree
,
lower
his
character
in
the
estimation
of
those
man
of
wit
and
gallantry
who
approve
the
hero
in
most
of
our
modern
comedy
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
two
sort
of
people
,
who
,
I
be
afraid
,
have
already
conceive
some
contempt
for
my
heroe
,
on
account
of
his
behaviour
to
Sophia
.
<EOS>
the
former
of
these
will
blame
his
prudence
in
neglect
an
opportunity
to
possess
himself
of
Mr
Western
's
fortune
;
and
the
latter
will
no
less
despise
him
for
his
backwardness
to
so
fine
a
girl
,
who
seem
ready
to
fly
into
his
arm
,
if
he
would
open
them
to
receive
her
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
though
I
shall
not
perhaps
be
able
absolutely
to
acquit
him
of
either
of
these
charge
(
for
want
of
prudence
<EOS>
admit
of
no
excuse
;
and
<EOS>
what
I
shall
produce
against
the
latter
charge
will
,
I
apprehend
,
be
scarce
satisfactory
)
;
yet
,
as
evidence
may
sometimes
be
offer
in
mitigation
,
I
shall
set
forth
the
plain
matter
of
fact
,
and
leave
the
whole
to
the
reader
's
determination
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Jones
have
somewhat
about
him
,
which
,
though
I
think
writer
be
not
thoroughly
agree
in
its
name
,
doth
certainly
inhabit
some
human
breast
;
whose
use
be
not
so
properly
to
distinguish
right
from
wrong
,
as
to
prompt
and
incite
them
to
the
former
,
and
to
restrain
and
withhold
them
from
the
latter
.
  
<EOS>
this
somewhat
may
be
indeed
resemble
to
the
famous
trunk
-
maker
in
the
playhouse
;
for
,
whenever
the
person
who
be
possess
of
it
doth
what
be
right
,
no
ravished
or
friendly
spectator
be
so
eager
or
so
loud
in
his
applause
:
on
the
contrary
,
when
he
doth
wrong
,
no
critic
be
so
apt
to
hiss
and
explode
him
.
  
<EOS>
to
give
a
high
idea
of
the
principle
I
mean
,
as
well
as
one
more
familiar
to
the
present
age
;
it
may
be
consider
as
sit
on
its
throne
in
the
mind
,
like
the
Lord
High
Chancellor
of
this
kingdom
in
his
court
;
where
it
preside
,
govern
,
direct
,
judge
,
acquit
,
and
condemn
accord
to
merit
and
justice
,
with
a
knowledge
which
nothing
escape
,
a
penetration
which
nothing
can
deceive
,
and
an
integrity
which
nothing
can
corrupt
.
  
<EOS>
this
active
principle
may
perhaps
be
say
to
constitute
the
most
essential
barrier
between
us
and
our
neighbour
the
brute
;
for
if
there
be
some
in
the
human
shape
who
be
not
under
any
such
dominion
,
I
choose
rather
to
consider
them
as
deserter
from
us
to
our
neighbour
;
among
whom
they
will
have
the
fate
of
deserter
,
and
not
be
place
in
the
first
rank
.
  
<EOS>
Our
heroe
,
whether
he
derive
it
from
Thwackum
or
Square
<EOS>
I
will
not
determine
,
be
very
strongly
under
the
guidance
of
this
principle
;
for
though
he
do
not
always
act
rightly
,
yet
he
never
do
otherwise
without
feel
and
suffer
for
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
this
which
teach
him
,
that
to
repay
the
civility
and
little
friendship
of
hospitality
by
rob
the
house
where
you
have
receive
them
,
be
to
be
the
base
and
mean
of
thief
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
think
the
baseness
of
this
offence
lessen
by
the
height
of
the
injury
commit
;
on
the
contrary
,
if
to
steal
another
's
plate
deserved
death
and
infamy
,
it
seem
to
him
difficult
to
assign
a
punishment
adequate
to
the
robbing
a
man
of
his
whole
fortune
,
and
of
his
child
into
the
bargain
.
  
<EOS>
this
principle
,
therefore
,
prevent
him
from
any
thought
of
make
his
fortune
by
such
mean
(
for
this
,
as
I
have
say
,
be
an
active
principle
,
and
doth
not
content
itself
with
knowledge
or
belief
only
)
.
<EOS>
have
he
be
greatly
enamour
of
Sophia
,
he
possibly
may
have
think
otherwise
;
but
give
me
leave
to
say
,
there
be
great
difference
between
run
away
with
a
man
's
daughter
from
the
motive
of
love
,
and
do
the
same
thing
from
the
motive
of
theft
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
though
this
young
gentleman
be
not
insensible
of
the
charm
of
Sophia
;
though
he
greatly
like
her
beauty
,
and
esteem
all
her
other
qualification
,
she
have
make
,
however
,
no
deep
impression
on
his
heart
;
for
which
,
as
it
render
him
liable
to
the
charge
of
stupidity
,
or
at
least
of
want
of
taste
,
we
shall
now
proceed
to
account
.
  
<EOS>
the
truth
then
be
,
his
heart
be
in
the
possession
of
another
woman
.
<EOS>
here
I
question
not
but
the
reader
will
be
surprize
at
our
long
taciturnity
as
to
this
matter
;
and
quite
at
a
loss
to
divine
who
this
woman
be
,
since
we
have
hitherto
not
dropt
a
hint
of
any
one
likely
to
be
a
rival
to
Sophia
;
for
as
to
Mrs
Blifil
,
though
we
have
be
oblige
to
mention
some
suspicion
of
her
affection
for
Tom
,
we
have
not
hitherto
give
the
least
latitude
for
imagine
that
he
have
any
for
her
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
be
sorry
to
say
it
,
but
the
youth
of
both
sex
be
too
apt
to
be
deficient
in
their
gratitude
for
that
regard
with
which
person
more
advanced
in
year
<EOS>
be
sometimes
so
kind
to
honour
them
.
  
<EOS>
that
the
reader
may
be
no
longer
in
suspense
,
he
will
be
pleased
to
remember
,
that
we
have
often
mention
the
family
of
George
Seagrim
(
commonly
call
Black
George
,
the
gamekeeper
)
,
which
consist
at
present
of
a
wife
and
five
child
.
  
<EOS>
the
second
of
these
child
be
a
daughter
,
whose
name
be
Molly
,
and
who
be
esteem
one
of
the
handsome
girl
in
the
whole
country
.
  
<EOS>
Congreve
well
say
there
be
in
true
beauty
something
which
vulgar
soul
can
not
admire
;
so
can
no
dirt
or
rag
hide
this
something
from
those
soul
which
be
not
of
the
vulgar
stamp
.
  
<EOS>
the
beauty
of
this
girl
make
,
however
,
no
impression
on
Tom
,
till
she
grow
towards
the
age
of
sixteen
,
when
Tom
,
who
be
near
three
year
old
,
begin
first
to
cast
the
eye
of
affection
upon
her
.
<EOS>
and
this
affection
he
have
fix
on
the
girl
long
before
he
could
bring
himself
to
attempt
the
possession
of
her
person
:
for
though
his
constitution
urge
him
greatly
to
this
,
his
principle
no
less
forcibly
restrain
him
.
<EOS>
to
debauch
a
young
woman
,
however
low
her
condition
be
,
appear
to
him
a
very
heinous
crime
;
and
the
good
-
will
he
bear
the
father
,
with
the
compassion
he
have
for
his
family
,
very
strongly
corroborate
all
such
sober
reflection
;
so
that
he
once
resolve
to
get
the
well
of
his
inclination
,
and
he
actually
abstain
three
whole
month
without
ever
go
to
Seagrim
's
house
,
or
see
his
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
though
Molly
be
,
as
we
have
say
,
generally
think
a
very
fine
girl
,
and
in
reality
she
be
so
,
yet
her
beauty
be
not
of
the
most
amiable
kind
.
<EOS>
It
have
,
indeed
,
very
little
of
feminine
in
it
,
and
would
have
become
a
man
at
least
as
well
as
a
woman
;
for
,
to
say
the
truth
,
youth
and
florid
health
have
a
very
considerable
share
in
the
composition
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
her
mind
more
effeminate
than
her
person
.
<EOS>
as
this
be
tall
and
robust
,
so
be
that
bold
and
forward
.
<EOS>
so
little
have
she
of
modesty
,
that
Jones
have
more
regard
for
her
virtue
than
she
herself
.
<EOS>
and
as
most
probably
she
like
Tom
as
well
as
he
like
her
,
so
when
she
perceive
his
backwardness
<EOS>
she
herself
grow
proportionably
forward
;
and
when
she
see
he
have
entirely
desert
the
house
,
she
find
mean
of
throw
herself
in
his
way
,
and
behave
in
such
a
manner
that
the
youth
must
have
have
very
much
or
very
little
of
the
heroe
if
her
endeavour
have
prove
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
she
soon
triumph
over
all
the
virtuous
resolution
of
Jones
;
for
though
she
behave
at
last
with
all
decent
reluctance
,
yet
I
rather
chuse
to
attribute
the
triumph
to
her
,
since
,
in
fact
,
it
be
her
design
which
succeed
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
conduct
of
this
matter
,
I
say
,
Molly
so
well
play
her
part
,
that
Jones
attribute
the
conquest
entirely
to
himself
,
and
consider
the
young
woman
as
one
who
have
yield
to
the
violent
attack
of
his
passion
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
impute
her
yield
to
the
ungovernable
force
of
her
love
towards
him
;
and
this
the
reader
will
allow
to
have
be
a
very
natural
and
probable
supposition
,
as
we
have
more
than
once
mention
the
uncommon
comeliness
of
his
person
:
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
he
be
one
of
the
handsome
young
fellow
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
as
there
be
some
mind
whose
affection
,
like
Master
Blifil
's
,
be
solely
place
on
one
single
person
,
whose
interest
and
indulgence
alone
they
consider
on
every
occasion
;
regard
the
good
and
ill
of
all
other
as
merely
indifferent
,
any
farther
than
as
they
contribute
to
the
pleasure
or
advantage
of
that
person
:
so
there
be
a
different
temper
of
mind
which
borrow
a
degree
of
virtue
even
from
self
-
love
.
<EOS>
such
can
never
receive
any
kind
of
satisfaction
from
another
,
without
love
the
creature
to
whom
that
satisfaction
be
owe
,
and
without
make
its
well
-
being
in
some
sort
necessary
to
their
own
ease
.
  
<EOS>
of
this
latter
specie
be
our
heroe
.
<EOS>
He
consider
this
poor
girl
as
one
whose
happiness
or
misery
he
have
cause
to
be
dependent
on
himself
.
<EOS>
Her
beauty
be
still
the
object
of
desire
,
though
great
beauty
,
or
a
fresher
object
,
may
have
be
more
so
;
but
the
little
abatement
which
fruition
have
occasion
to
this
be
highly
overbalance
by
the
consideration
of
the
affection
which
she
visibly
bear
him
,
and
of
the
situation
into
which
he
have
bring
her
.
<EOS>
the
former
of
these
create
gratitude
,
the
latter
compassion
;
and
both
,
together
with
his
desire
for
her
person
,
raise
in
him
a
passion
which
may
,
without
any
great
violence
to
the
word
,
be
call
love
;
though
,
perhaps
,
it
be
at
first
not
very
judiciously
place
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
then
,
be
the
true
reason
of
that
insensibility
which
he
have
show
to
the
charm
of
Sophia
,
and
that
behaviour
in
her
which
may
have
be
reasonably
enough
interpret
as
an
encouragement
to
his
address
;
for
as
he
could
not
think
of
abandon
his
Molly
,
poor
and
destitute
as
she
be
,
so
no
more
could
he
entertain
a
notion
of
betray
such
a
creature
as
Sophia
.
<EOS>
and
surely
,
have
he
give
the
least
encouragement
to
any
passion
for
that
young
lady
<EOS>
,
he
must
have
be
absolutely
guilty
of
one
or
other
of
those
crime
;
either
of
which
would
,
in
my
opinion
,
have
very
justly
subject
him
to
that
fate
,
which
,
at
his
first
introduction
into
this
history
,
I
mention
to
have
be
generally
predict
as
his
certain
destiny
.
    
<EOS>
be
the
short
chapter
in
this
book
.
 
<EOS>
Her
mother
first
perceive
the
alteration
in
the
shape
of
Molly
;
and
in
order
to
hide
it
from
her
neighbour
,
she
foolishly
clothe
her
in
that
sack
which
Sophia
have
send
her
;
though
,
indeed
,
that
young
lady
have
little
apprehension
that
the
poor
woman
would
have
be
weak
enough
to
let
any
of
her
daughter
wear
it
in
that
form
.
  
<EOS>
Molly
be
charm
with
the
first
opportunity
she
ever
have
of
show
her
beauty
to
advantage
;
for
though
she
could
very
well
bear
to
contemplate
herself
in
the
glass
,
even
when
dress
in
rag
;
and
though
she
have
in
that
dress
conquer
the
heart
of
Jones
,
and
perhaps
of
some
other
;
yet
she
think
the
addition
of
finery
would
much
improve
her
charm
,
and
extend
her
conquest
.
  
<EOS>
molly
,
therefore
,
have
dress
herself
out
in
this
sack
,
with
a
new
laced
cap
,
and
some
other
ornament
which
Tom
have
give
her
,
repair
to
church
with
her
fan
in
her
hand
the
very
next
Sunday

<EOS>
the
great

they

ambition
and
vanity
to
themselves
.
<EOS>

noble

in

in

here

and
circumvention
,
party

those

<EOS>
nor

the

here

in
the
high
feminine
art
than
their

malice
,

in
short
,
everything
which

common
to

most
splendid

<EOS>
let
those

no

despise
the
ignorance
of
their
inferior

nor

vulgar
any

Mr
Western

as
his

at
little
great
distance

he

often
come
to

whom

for
her
simplicity

have
dress
herself
in
that
manner
,
as
she
see
the
envy
which
it
have
occasion
among
her
equal

<EOS>
She
no
sooner
come
home
than
she
send
for
the
gamekeeper
,
and
order
him
to
bring
his
daughter
to
her
;
say
she
would
provide
for
her
in
the
family
,
and
may
possibly
place
the
girl
about
her
own
person
,
when
her
own
maid
,
who
be
now
go
away
,
have
leave
her

<EOS>
Poor
Seagrim
be
thunderstruck
at
this
;
for
he
be
no
stranger
to
the
fault
in
the
shape
of
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
He
answer
,
in
a
stammering
voice
,
"
that
he
be
afraid
Molly
would
be
too
awkward
to
wait
on
her
ladyship
,
as
she
have
never
be
at
service
.
"
<EOS>
"
no
matter
for
that
,
"
say
Sophia
;
"
she
will
soon
improve
.
<EOS>
I
be

<EOS>
Black
George
now
repair
to
his
wife
,
on
whose
prudent
counsel
he
depend
to
extricate
him
out
of
this
dilemma
;
but
when
he
come
thither
he
find
his
house
in
some
confusion
.
<EOS>
so
great
envy
have
this
sack
occasion
,
that
when
Mr
Allworthy
and
the
other
gentry
be
go
from
church
,
the
rage
,
which
have
hitherto
be
confine
,
burst
into
an
uproar
;
and
,
have
vent
itself
at
first
in
opprobrious
word
,
laugh
,
hiss
,
and
gesture
,
betook
itself
at
last
to
certain
missile
weapon
;
which
,
though
from
their
plastic
nature
they
threaten
neither
the
loss
of
life
or
of
limb
,
be
however
sufficiently
dreadful
to
a
well
-
dress
lady
.
<EOS>
Molly
have
too
much
spirit
to
bear
this
treatment
tamely
.
<EOS>
have
therefore
 
but
hold
,
as
we
be
diffident
of
our
own
ability
,
let
us
here
invite
a
superior
power
to
our
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
Ye
Muses

whoever

who
love
to

and
principally
thou
who
whilom
didst
recount
the
slaughter

if
thou

assist
me
on
this
great
occasion

<EOS>
all
thing
be
not
in
the
power
of

<EOS>
as
a
vast

yard
,
if
,
while
they

they
hear

<EOS>
some

inspire
by
rage
,
other
alarm
by
fear

and
other
have
nothing
in
their
head
but
the
love
of
fun
;
but
chiefly
Envy
,
the
sister
of
Satan
,
and
his
constant
companion
,
rush
among
the
crowd
,
and
blow
up
the
fury
of
the
woman
;
who
no
sooner
come
up
to
Molly
than
they
pelt
her
with
dirt
and
rubbish
.
  
<EOS>
molly
,
have
endeavour
in
vain
to
make
a
handsome
retreat
,
face
about

and
lay
hold
of
ragged
Bess

who
advance
in
the
front
of
the
enemy
,
she
at
one
blow
fell
her
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
the
whole
army
of
the
enemy
(
though
near
a
hundred
in
number
)
,
see
the
fate
of
their
general
,
give
back
many
pace
,
and
retire
behind
a
new

dig
grave
;
for
the
churchyard
be
the
field
of
battle
,
where
there
be
to
be
a
funeral
that
very
evening
.
<EOS>
molly
pursue
her
victory
,
and
catch
up
a
skull
which
lie
on
the
side
of
the
grave
,
discharge
it
with
such
fury
,
that
have
hit
a
taylor
on
the
head
,
the
two
skull
send
equally
forth
a
hollow
sound
at
their
meeting

and
the
taylor
take
presently
measure
of
his
length
on
the
ground
,
where
the
skull
lie
side
by
side
,
and
it
be
doubtful
which
be
the
more
valuable
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
molly
then
take
a
thigh
-
bone
in
her
hand
,
fall
in
among
the
fly
rank
,
and
deal
her
blow
with
great
liberality
on
either
side
,
overthrow
the
carcass
of
many
a
mighty
heroe
and
heroine
.
  
<EOS>
Recount
,
O

the
name
of
those

fall
on
this
fatal

he
cheer
the

when
upon

interweave
the
sprightly

while
he

and
jump
to
his
own
music
.
<EOS>
how
little
now
avail
his
fiddle
!
<EOS>
He
thump
the
verdant
floor
with
his
carcass
.
<EOS>
next
,
old
Echepole
,
the
sowgelder
,
receive
a
blow
in
his
forehead
from
our
amazonian
heroine
,
and
immediately
fall
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
swinging
fat
fellow
,
and
fall
with
almost
as
much
noise
as

<EOS>
His
tobacco

box
drop
at
the
same
time
from
his
pocket
,
which
Molly
take
up
as
lawful
spoil

<EOS>
then
Kate

Mill
tumble
unfortunately
over
a
tombstone
,
which
catch
hold
of
her
ungartered

invert
the

<EOS>
Betty

,
with

fall

to

oh
perverse
fate

<EOS>
she
salute
the

,
and
he
the

<EOS>
Tom
Freckle
,
the

be
the
next
victim
to
her
rage

<EOS>
He
be
an
ingenious

make
excellent

nay

the
very
patten
with
which
he

<EOS>

not

for
many
of

in
their
flight
overthrow

<EOS>
but
now
Fortune
,
fear
she
have
act
out
of
character
,
and
have
incline
too
long
to
the
same
side
,
especially
as
it
be
the
right
side
,
hastily
turn
about
:
for
now
Goody
Brown
 
<EOS>
whom
Zekiel
Brown
caress
in
his
arm
;
nor
he
alone
,
but
half
the
parish
besides
;
so
famous
be
she
in
the
field
of
Venus
,
nor
indeed
less
in
those
of
Mars
.
<EOS>
the
trophy
of
both
these
her
husband
always
bear
about
on
his
head
and
face
;
for
if
ever
human
head
do
by
its
horn
display
the
amorous
glory
of
a
wife
,
Zekiel
's
do
;
nor
do
his
well
-
scratch
face
less
denote
her
talent
(
or
rather
talon
)
of
a
different
kind
.
  
<EOS>
no
longer
bear
this
Amazon
the
shameful
flight
of
her
party
.
<EOS>
She
stopt
short
,
and
,
call
aloud
to
all
who
flee
,
speak
as
follow
:
"
Ye
Somersetshire
man
,
or
rather
ye
Somersetshire
woman
,
be
ye
not
ashamed
thus
to
fly
from
a
single
woman
?
<EOS>
but
if
no
other
will
oppose
her
,
I
myself
and
Joan
Top
here
will
have
the
honour
of
the
victory
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
thus
say
,
she
fly
at
Molly
Seagrim
,
and
easily
wrench
the
thigh
-
bone
from
her
hand
,
at
the
same
time
claw
off
her
cap
from
her
head
.
<EOS>
then
lay
hold
of
the
hair
of
Molly
with
her
left
hand
,
she
attack
her
so
furiously
in
the
face
with
the
right
,
that
the
blood
soon
begin
to
trickle
from
her
nose
.
<EOS>
Molly
be
not
idle
this
while
.
<EOS>
She
soon
remove
the
clout
from
the
head
of
Goody
Brown
,
and
then
fasten
on
her
hair
with
one
hand
,
with
the
other
she
cause
another
bloody
stream
to
issue
forth
from
the
nostril
of
the
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
when
each
of
the
combatant
have
bear
off
sufficient
spoil
of
hair
from
the
head
of
her
antagonist
,
the
next
rage
be
against
the
garment
.
<EOS>
in
this
attack
they
exert
so
much
violence
,
that
in
a
very
few
minute
they
be
both
naked
to
the
middle
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
lucky
for
the
woman
that
the
seat
of
fistycuff
war
be
not
the
same
with
them
as
among
man
;
but
though
they
may
seem
a
little
to
deviate
from
their
sex
,
when
they
go
forth
to
battle
,
yet
I
have
observe
,
they
never
so
far
forget
,
as
to
assail
the
bosom
of
each
other
;
where
a
few
blow
would
be
fatal
to
most
of
them
.
<EOS>
this
,
I
know
,
some
derive
from
their
being
of
a
more
bloody
inclination
than
the
male
.
<EOS>
on
which
account
they
apply
to
the
nose
,
as
to
the
part
whence
blood
may
most
easily
be
draw
;
but
this
seem
a
far
-
fetched
as
well
as
ill
-
natured
supposition
.
  
<EOS>
Goody
Brown
have
great
advantage
of
Molly
in
this
particular
;
for
the
former
have
indeed
no
breast
,
her
bosom
(
if
it
may
be
so
call
)
,
as
well
in
colour
as
in
many
other
property
,
exactly
resemble
an
antient
piece
of
parchment
,
upon
which
any
one
may
have
drum
a
considerable
while
without
do
her
any
great
damage
.
  
<EOS>
molly
,
beside
her
present
unhappy
condition
,
be
differently
form
in
those
part
,
and
may
,
perhaps
,
have
tempt
the
envy
of
Brown
to
give
her
a
fatal
blow
,
have
not
the
lucky
arrival
of
Tom
Jones
at
this
instant
put
an
immediate
end
to
the
bloody
scene
.
  
<EOS>
this
accident
be
luckily
owing
to
Mr
Square
;
for
he
,
Master
Blifil
,
and
Jones
,
have
mount
their
horse
,
after
church
,
to
take
the
air
,
and
have
ride
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,
when
Square
,
change
his
mind
(
not
idly
,
but
for
a
reason
which
we
shall
unfold
as
soon
as
we
have
leisure
)
,
desire
the
young
gentleman
to
ride
with
him
another
way
than
they
have
at
first
purpose
.
<EOS>
this
motion
be
comply
with
,
bring
them
of
necessity
back
again
to
the
churchyard
.
  
<EOS>
Master
Blifil
,
who
ride
first
,
see
such
a
mob
assemble
,
and
two
woman
in
the
posture
in
which
we
leave
the
combatant
,
stopt
his
horse
to
enquire
what
be
the
matter
.
<EOS>
a
country
fellow
,
scratch
his
head
,
answer
him
:
"
I
do
not
know
,
measter
,
un't
I
;
an't
please
your
honour
,
here
<EOS>
hath
be
a
vight
,
I
think
,
between
Goody
Brown
and
Moll
Seagrim
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
,
who
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Tom
;
but
without
wait
for
an
answer
,
have
discover
the
feature
of
his
Molly
through
all
the
discomposure
in
which
they
now
be
,
he
hastily
alight
,
turn
his
horse
loose
,
and
,
leap
over
the
wall
,
run
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
now
first
burst
into
tear
,
tell
him
how
barbarously
she
have
be
treat
.
<EOS>
upon
which
,
forget
the
sex
of
Goody
Brown
,
or
perhaps
not
know
it
in
his
rage
 
for
,
in
reality
,
she
have
no
feminine
appearance
but
a
petticoat
,
which
he
may
not
observe
 
<EOS>
he
give
her
a
lash
or
two
with
his
horsewhip
;
and
then
fly
at
the
mob
,
who
be
all
accuse
by
Moll
,
he
deal
his
blow
so
profusely
on
all
side
,
that
unless
I
would
again
invoke
the
muse
(
which
the
good
-
natured
reader
may
think
a
little
too
hard
upon
her
,
as
she
hath
so
lately
be
violently
sweat
)
,
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
recount
the
horse
-
whipping
of
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
have
scour
the
whole
coast
of
the
enemy
,
as
well
as
any
of
Homer
's
hero
ever
do
,
or
as
Don
Quixote
or
any
knight
-
errant
in
the
world
could
have
do
,
he
return
to
Molly
,
whom
he
find
in
a
condition
which
must
give
both
me
and
my
reader
pain
,
be
it
to
be
describe
here
.
<EOS>
Tom
rave
like
a
madman
,
beat
his
breast
,
tear
his
hair
,
stamp
on
the
ground
,
and
vow
the
utmost
vengeance
on
all
who
have
be
concern
.
<EOS>
He
then
pull
off
his
coat
,
and
button
it
round
her
,
put
his
hat
upon
her
head
,
wipe
the
blood
from
her
face
as
well
as
he
could
with
his
handkerchief
,
and
call
out
to
the
servant
to
ride
as
fast
as
possible
for
a
side
-
saddle
,
or
a
pillion
,
that
he
may
carry
her
safe
home
.
  
<EOS>
Master
Blifil
object
to
the
send
away
the
servant
,
as
they
have
only
one
with
them
;
but
as
Square
second
the
order
of
Jones
,
he
be
oblige
to
comply
.
  
<EOS>
the
servant
return
in
a
very
short
time
with
the
pillion
,
and
Molly
,
have
collect
her
rag
as
well
as
she
could

be

behind

<EOS>
in
which
manner
she
be
carry

<EOS>
here
Jones
have
receive
his
coat
,
give

a
sly
kiss
,
and
whisper
her
,
that
he
would
return
in
the
evening
,
quit
his
Molly
,
and
ride
on
after
his
companion

peaceable

<EOS>
Molly
have
no

violently
upon

"
<EOS>
how

I

say
she

I
myself
have
the

right

but
I
warrant
you

in
this
situation
Black

find
his

he
come
home

as
his

together

most
of

cry

it
be
some
time

as

he
acquaint
the

(
for

I

<EOS>
perhaps
,
as
Molly
say
,
it
may
be
in
the
kitchen
;
and
truly
I
do
not
care
my

should
be
a
scullion
wench

for

poor

I
be

I
be

so
could
not

it

<EOS>
some

<EOS>
I
warrant
she
fancy
she
do
a
mighty
matter

some

"
  
<EOS>
Black
George
be
,
in
the
main
,
a
peaceable
kind
of
fellow
,
and
nothing
choleric
nor
rash
;
yet
do
he
bear
about
him
something
of
what
the
antient
call
the
irascible
,
and
which
his
wife
,
if
she
have
be
endow
with
much
wisdom
,
would
have
fear
.
<EOS>
He
have
long
experience
,
that
when
the
storm
grow
very
high
,
argument
be
but
wind
,
which
serve
rather
to
increase
,
than
to
abate
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
therefore
seldom
unprovided
with
a
small
switch
,
a
remedy
of
wonderful
force
,
as
he
have
often
essay
,
and
which
the
word
villain
serve
as
a
hint
for
his
applying
.
  
<EOS>
no
sooner
,
therefore
,
have
this
symptom
appear
,
than
he
have
immediate
recourse
to
the
say
remedy
,
which
though
,
as
it
be
usual
in
all
very
efficacious
medicine
,
it
at
first
seem
to
heighten
and
inflame
the
disease
,
soon
produce
a
total
calm
,
and
restore
the
patient
to
perfect
ease
and
tranquillity
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
,
however
,
a
kind
of
horse
-
medicine
,
which
require
a
very
robust
constitution
to
digest
,
and
be
therefore
proper
only
for
the
vulgar
,
unless
in
one
single
instance
,
viz
.
,
where
superiority
of
birth
break
out
;
in
which
case
,
we
should
not
think
it
very
improperly
apply
by
any
husband
<EOS>
whatever
,
if
the
application
be
not
in
itself
so
base
,
<EOS>
that
,
like
certain
application
of
the
physical
kind
which
nee
not
be
mention
,
it
so
much
degrade
and
contaminate
the
hand
employ
in
it
,
that
no
gentleman
should
endure
the
thought
of
anything
so
low
and
detestable
.
  
<EOS>
the
whole
family
be
soon
reduce
to
a
state
of
perfect
quiet

the
virtue
of
this

of

often
communicate
through

to
many
other

who
be
not
touch
by
the
instrument
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
as
they
both
operate
by
friction
,
it
may
be
doubt
whether
there
be
not
something
analogous
between
them
,
of
which
Mr
Freke
would
do
well
to
enquire

before

that

at
length
resolve

Goody

should
wait
on
Miss
Western

and
endeavour
to
procure
the
place
for
her

great
readiness

Fortune

His

<EOS>
the
lovely
Sophia
shine
forth
that
day
with
more
gaiety
and
sprightliness
than
usual
.
<EOS>
Her
battery
be
certainly
level
at
our
heroe
;
though
,
I
believe
,
she
herself
scarce
yet
know
her
own
intention
;
but
if
she
have
any
design
of
charm
him
,
she
now
succeed

<EOS>
Mr
Supple
,
the
curate
of
Mr
Allworthy

parish
,
make
one
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
good
-
natured
worthy
man
;
but
chiefly
remarkable
for
his
great
taciturnity
at
table
,
though
his
mouth
be
never
shut
at
it
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
have
one
of
the
good
appetite
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
cloth
be
no
sooner
take
away
,
than
he
always
make
sufficient
amend
for
his
silence
:
for
he
be
a
very
hearty
fellow
;
and
his
conversation
be
often
entertaining
,
never
offensive
.
  
<EOS>
at
his
first
arrival
,
which
be
immediately
before
the
entrance
of
the
roast
-
beef
,
he
have
give
an
intimation
that
he
have
bring
some
news
with
him
,
and
be
begin
to
tell
,
that
he
come
that
moment
from
Mr
Allworthy
's
,
when
the
sight
of
the
roast
-
beef
strike
him
dumb
,
permit
him
only
to
say
grace
,
and
to
declare
he
must
pay
his
respect
to
the
baronet
,
for
so
he
call
the
sirloin
.
  
<EOS>
when
dinner
be
over
,
be
remind
by
Sophia
of
his
news
,
he
begin
as
follow
:
"
<EOS>
I
believe
,
lady
,
your
ladyship
observe
a
young
woman
at
church
yesterday
at
even
-
song
,
who
be
dr
in
one
of
your
outlandish
garment
;
I
think
I
have
see
your
ladyship
in
such
a
one
.
<EOS>
however
,
in
the
country

such
dress
be
  
Rara
avi
in

nigroque
simillima
cygno

<EOS>
that
is
,
madam
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
a
rare
bird
upon
the
earth
,
and
very
like
a
black
swan
.
<EOS>
"
the
verse
be
in
Juvenal
.
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
what
I
be
relate
.
<EOS>
I
be
say
such
garment
be
rare
sight
in
the
country
;
and
perchance
,
too
,
it
be
think
the
more
rare
,
respect
be
have
to
the
person
who
wear
it
,
who
,
they
tell
me
,
be
the
daughter
of
Black
George
,
your
worship
's
gamekeeper
,
whose
suffering
,
I
should
have
opine
,
may
have
teach
him
more
wit
,
than
to
dress
forth
his
wench
in
such
gaudy
apparel
.
<EOS>
She
create
so
much
confusion
in
the
congregation
,
that
if
Squire
Allworthy
have
not
silence
it
,
it
would
have
interrupt
the
service
:
for
I
be
once
about
to
stop
in
the
middle
of
the
first
lesson
.
<EOS>
howbeit
,
nevertheless
,
after
prayer
be
over
,
and
I
be
depart
home
,
this
occasion
a
battle
in
the
churchyard
,
where
,
amongst
other
mischief
,
the
head
of
a
travel
fidler
be
very
much
broken
.
<EOS>
this
morning
the
fidler
come
to
Squire
Allworthy
for
a
warrant
,
and
the
wench
be
bring
before
him
.
<EOS>
the
squire
be
incline
to
have
compound
matter
;
when
,
lo
!
<EOS>
on
a
sudden
the
wench
appear
<EOS>
(
I
ask
your
ladyship
's
pardon
)
to
be
,
as
it
be
,
at
the
eve
of
bring
forth
a
bastard

<EOS>
the
squire
demand
of
her
who
be
the
father
?
<EOS>
but
she
pertinaciously
refuse
to
make
any
response

<EOS>
so
that
he
be
about
to
make
her
mittimus
to
Bridewell
when
I

public

something

<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
it
be
too
common

indeed

answer
the
parson

<EOS>

I
think
the
whole
story
altogether
deserve
commemorating

as
to
national
matter

<EOS>
"
why

say
the
squire
,
"
I
believe
I
do
know
a
little
of
that
matter

as
you
say

but
,
come
,
Tommy

drink
about

the
bottle
stand

Tom
beg
to
be
excuse

for
that
he
have
particular
business
;
and
get
up
from
table
,
escape
the
clutch
of
the
squire
,
who
be
rise
to
stop
him
,
and
go
off
with
very
little
ceremony
.
  
<EOS>
the
squire
give
him
a
good
curse
at
his
departure
;
and
then
turn
to
the
parson
,
he
cry
out
,
"
I
smoke
it

<EOS>
I
smoke
it

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
very
sorry
for
that
,
"
say
the
parson
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
sorry

"
cry
the
squire
:
"
<EOS>
where
be
the
mighty
matter

<EOS>
"
Your
worship
be
pleased
to
be
jocular
,
"
answer
the
parson
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
only
animadvert
on
the
sinfulness
of
the
action
 
though
that
surely
be
to
be
greatly
deprecate
 
<EOS>
but
I
fear
his
unrighteousness
may
injure
him
with
Mr
Allworthy
.
<EOS>
and
truly
I
must
say
,
though
he
hath
the
character
of
be
a
little
wild
,
I
never
see
any
harm
in
the
young
man
;
nor
can
I
say
I
have
hear
any
,
save
what
your
worship
now
mention
.
<EOS>
I
wish
,
indeed
,
he
be
a
little
more
regular
in
his
response
at
church
;
but
altogether
he
seem
  
Ingenui
vultus
puer
ingenuique
pudoris

<EOS>
that
be
a
classical

countenance
,
and
of
an
ingenuous
modesty
;
"
for
this
be
a
virtue
in
great
repute
both
among
the
Latins
and
Greeks
.
<EOS>
I
must
say
,
the
young
gentleman
(
for
<EOS>
so
I
think
I
may
call
him
,
notwithstanding
his
birth
)
<EOS>
appear
to
me
a
very
modest
,
civil
lad
,
and
I
should
be
sorry
that
he
should
do
himself
any
injury
in
Squire
Allworthy
's
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poogh
!
"
say
the
squire
:
"
injury
,
with
Allworthy
!
<EOS>
why
,
Allworthy
love
a
wench
himself
.
<EOS>
doth
<EOS>
not
all
the
country
know
whose
son
Tom
be
?
<EOS>
You
must
talk
to
another
person
in
that
manner
.
<EOS>
I
remember
Allworthy
at
college
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
say
the
parson
,
"
he
have
never
be
at
the
university
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
he
be
,
"
say
the
squire
:
"
and
many
a
wench
have
we
two
have
together
.
<EOS>
as
arrant
a
whore
-
master
as
any
within
five
mile
o'un
.
<EOS>
no
,
no
.
<EOS>
It
will
do'n
no
harm
with
he
,
assure
yourself
;
nor
with
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
ask
Sophy
there
 
<EOS>
You
have
not
the
bad
opinion
of
a
young
fellow
for
get
a
bastard
,
have
you
,
girl
?
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
the
woman
will
like
un
the
well
for't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
cruel
question
to
poor
Sophia
.
<EOS>
She
have
observe
Tom
's
colour
change
at
the
parson
's
story
;
and
that
,
with
his
hasty
and
abrupt
departure
,
give
her
sufficient
reason
to
think
her
father
's
suspicion
not
groundless
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
now
at
once
discover
the
great
secret
to
her
which
it
have
be
so
long
disclose
by
little
and
little
;
and
she
find
herself
highly
interested
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
in
such
a
situation
,
her
father
's
malapert
question
rush
suddenly
upon
her
,
produce
some
symptom
which
may
have
alarm
a
suspicious
heart
;
but
,
to
do
the
squire
justice
,
that
be
not
his
fault
.
<EOS>
when
she
rise
therefore
from
her
chair
,
and
tell
him
a
hint
from
him
be
always
sufficient
to
make
her
withdraw
,
he
suffer
her
to
leave
the
room
,
and
then
with
great
gravity
of
countenance
remark
,
"
that
it
be
well
to
see
a
daughter
over
-
modest
than
over
-
forward
;
"
 
a
sentiment
which
be
highly
applaud
by
the
parson
.
  
<EOS>
there
now
ensue
between
the
squire
and
the
parson
a
most
excellent
political
discourse
,
frame
out
of
newspaper
and
political
pamphlet
;
in
which
they
make
a
libation
of
four
bottle
of
wine
to
the
good
of
their
country
:
and
then
,
the
squire
be
fast
asleep
,
the
parson
light
his
pipe
,
mount
his
horse
,
and
ride
home
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
squire
have
finish
his
half
-
hour
's
nap
,
he
summon
his
daughter
to
her
harpsichord
;
but
she
beg
to
be
excuse
that
evening
,
on
account
of
a
violent
head
-
ache
.
<EOS>
this
remission
be
presently
grant
;
for
indeed
she
seldom
have
occasion
to
ask
him
twice
,
as
he
love
her
with
such
ardent
affection
,
that
,
by
gratify
her
,
he
commonly
convey
the
high
gratification
to
himself
.
<EOS>
She
be
really
,
what
he
frequently
call
her
,
his
little
darling
,
and
she
well
deserve
to
be
so
;
for
she
return
all
his
affection
in
the
most
ample
manner
.
<EOS>
She
have
preserve
the
most
inviolable
duty
to
him
in
all
thing
;
and
this
her
love
make
not
only
easy
,
but
so
delightful
,
that
when
one
of
her
companion
laugh
at
her
for
place
so
much
merit
in
such
scrupulous
obedience
,
as
that
young
lady
call
it
,
Sophia
answer
,
"
You
mistake
me
,
madam
,
if
you
think
I
value
myself
upon
this
account
;
for
besides
that
I
be
barely
discharge
my
duty
,
I
be
likewise
please
myself
.
<EOS>
I
can
truly
say
I
have
no
delight
equal
to
that
of
contribute
to
my
father
's
happiness
;
and
if
I
value
myself
,
my
dear
,
it
be
on
have
this
power
,
and
not
on
execute
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
satisfaction
,
however
,
which
poor
Sophia
be
incapable
of
taste
this
evening
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
not
only
desire
to
be
excuse
from
her
attendance
at
the
harpsichord
,
but
likewise
beg
that
he
would
suffer
her
to
absent
herself
from
supper
.
<EOS>
to
this
request
likewise
the
squire
agree
,
though
not
without
some
reluctance
;
for
he
scarce
ever
permit
her
to
be
out
of
his
sight
,
unless
when
he
be
engage
with
his
horse
,
dog
,
or
bottle
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
he
yield
to
the
desire
of
his
daughter
,
though
the
poor
man
be
at
the
same
time
oblige
to
avoid
his
own
company
(
if
I
may
so
express
myself
)
,
by
send
for
a
neighbouring
farmer
to
sit
with
him
.
    
<EOS>
the
narrow
escape
of
Molly
Seagrim
,
with
some
observation
for
which
we
have
be
force
to
dive
pretty
deep
into
nature
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
Jones
have
ride
one
of
Mr
Western
's
horse
that
morning
in
the
chase
;
so
that
have
no
horse
of
his
own
in
the
squire
's
stable
,
he
be
oblige
to
go
home
on
foot
:
this
he
do
so
expeditiously
that
he
run
upwards
of
three
mile
within
the
half
-
hour
.
  
<EOS>
just
as
he
arrive
at
Mr
Allworthy
's
outward
gate
,
he
meet
the
constable
and
company
with
Molly
in
their
possession
,
whom
they
be
conduct
to
that
house
where
the
inferior
sort
of
people
may
learn
one
good
lesson
,
viz
.
,
respect
and
deference
to
their
superior
;
since
it
must
show
them
the
wide
distinction
Fortune
intend
between
those
person
who
be
to
be
correct
for
their
fault
,
and
those
who
be
not
;
which
lesson
if
they
do
not
learn
,
I
be
afraid
they
very
rarely
learn
any
other
good
lesson
,
or
improve
their
moral
,
at
the
house
of
correction
.
  
<EOS>
a
lawyer
may
perhaps
think
Mr
Allworthy
exceed
his
authority
a
little
in
this
instance
.
<EOS>
and
,
to
say
the
truth
,
I
question
,
as
here
be
no
regular
information
before
him
,
whether
his
conduct
be
strictly
regular
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
his
intention
be
truly
upright
,
he
ought
to
be
excuse
in
foro
conscientiae
;
since
so
many
arbitrary
act
be
daily
commit
by
magistrate
who
have
not
this
excuse
to
plead
for
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
be
no
sooner
inform
by
the
constable
whither
they
be
proceed
(
indeed
he
pretty
well
guess
it
of
himself
)
,
than
he
catch
Molly
in
his
arm
,
and
embrace
her
tenderly
before
them
all
,
swear
he
would
murder
the
first
man
who
offer
to
lay
hold
of
her
.
<EOS>
He
bid
her
dry
her
eye
and
be
comfort
;
for
,
wherever
she
go
,
he
would
accompany
her
.
<EOS>
then
turn
to
the
constable
,
who
stand
tremble
with
his
hat
off
,
he
desire
him
,
in
a
very
mild
voice
,
to
return
with
him
for
a
moment
only
to
his
father
(
for
so
he
now
call
Allworthy
)
;
for
he
durst
,
he
say
,
be
assure
,
that
,
when
he
have
alledge
what
he
have
to
say
in
her
favour
,
the
girl
would
be
discharge
.
  
<EOS>
the
constable
,
who
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
would
have
surrender
his
prisoner
have
<EOS>
Tom
demand
her
,
very
readily
consent
to
this
request
.
<EOS>
so
back
they
all
go
into
Mr
Allworthy
's
hall
;
where
Tom
desire
them
to
stay
till
his
return
,
and
then
go
himself
in
pursuit
of
the
good
man
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
be
find
,
Tom
throw
himself
at
his
foot
,
and
have
beg
a
patient
hearing
,
confess
himself
to
be
the
father
of
the
child
of
which
Molly
be
then
big
.
<EOS>
He
entreat
him
to
have
compassion
on
the
poor
girl
,
and
to
consider
,
if
there
be
any
guilt
in
the
case
,
it
lie
principally
at
his
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
there
be
any
guilt
in
the
case
!
"
answer
Allworthy
warmly
:
"
be
you
then
so
profligate
and
abandon
a
libertine
to
doubt
whether
the
break
the
law
of
God
and
man
,
the
corrupting
and
ruin
a
poor
girl
be
guilt
?
<EOS>
I
own
,
indeed
,
it
doth
lie
principally
upon
you
;
and
so
heavy
it
be
,
that
you
ought
to
expect
it
should
crush
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
whatever
may
be
my
fate
,
"
say
Tom
,
"
let
me
succeed
in
my
intercession
for
the
poor
girl
.
<EOS>
I
confess
I
have
corrupt
her
!
<EOS>
but
whether
she
shall
be
ruin
,
depend
on
you
.
<EOS>
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
sir
,
revoke
your
warrant
,
and
do
not
send
her
to
a
place
which
must
unavoidably
prove
her
destruction
.
"
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
bid
him
immediately
call
a
servant
.
<EOS>
Tom
answer
there
be
no
occasion
;
for
he
have
luckily
meet
them
at
the
gate
,
and
rely
upon
his
goodness
,
have
bring
them
all
back
into
his
hall
,
where
they
now
wait
his
final
resolution
,
which
upon
his
knee
he
beseech
him
may
be
in
favour
of
the
girl
;
that
she
may
be
permit
to
go
home
to
her
parent
,
and
not
be
expose
to
a
great
degree
of
shame
and
scorn
than
must
necessarily
fall
upon
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
be
too
much
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
be
the
wicked
occasion
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
endeavour
to
make
amend
,
if
possible
;
and
if
you
shall
have
hereafter
the
goodness
to
forgive
me
,
I
hope
I
shall
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
hesitate
some
time
,
and
at
last
say
,
"
well
,
I
will
discharge
my
mittimus
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
send
the
constable
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
instantly
call
,
discharge
,
and
so
be
the
girl
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
be
believe
that
Mr
Allworthy
fail
not
to
read
Tom
a
very
severe
lecture
on
this
occasion
;
but
it
be
unnecessary
to
insert
it
here
,
as
we
have
faithfully
transcribe
what
he
say
to
Jenny
Jones
in
the
first
book
,
most
of
which
may
be
apply
to
the
man
,
equally
with
the
woman
.
<EOS>
so
sensible
an
effect
have
these
reproofs
on
the
young
man
,
who
be
no
harden
sinner
,
that
he
retire
to
his
own
room
,
where
he
pass
the
evening
alone
,
in
much
melancholy
contemplation
.
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
be
sufficiently
offend
by
this
transgression
of
Jones
;
for
notwithstanding
the
assertion
of
Mr
Western
,
it
be
certain
this
worthy
man
have
never
indulge
himself
in
any
loose
pleasure
with
woman
,
and
greatly
condemn
the
vice
of
incontinence
in
other
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
there
be
much
reason
to
imagine
that
there
be
not
the
least
truth
in
what
Mr
Western
affirm
,
especially
as
he
lay
the
scene
of
those
impurity
at
the
university
,
where
Mr
Allworthy
have
never
be
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
the
good
squire
be
a
little
too
apt
to
indulge
that
kind
of
pleasantry
which
be
generally
call
rhodomontade
:
but
which
may
,
with
as
much
propriety
,
be
express
by
a
much
short
word
;
and
perhaps
we
too
often
supply
the
use
of
this
little
monosyllable
by
other
;
since
very
much
of
what
frequently
pass
in
the
world
for
wit
and
humour
,
should
,
in
the
strict
purity
of
language
,
receive
that
short
appellation
,
which
,
in
conformity
to
the
well
-
breed
law
of
custom
,
I
here
suppress
.
  
<EOS>
but
whatever
detestation
Mr
Allworthy
have
to
this
or
to
any
other
vice
,
he
be
not
so
blind
by
it
but
<EOS>
that
he
could
discern
any
virtue
in
the
guilty
person
,
as
clearly
indeed
as
if
there
have
be
no
mixture
of
vice
in
the
same
character
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
angry
therefore
with
the
incontinence
of
Jones
,
he
be
no
less
pleased
with
the
honour
and
honesty
of
his
self
-
accusation
.
<EOS>
He
begin
now
to
form
in
his
mind
the
same
opinion
of
this
young
fellow
,
which
,
we
hope
,
our
reader
may
have
conceive
.
<EOS>
and
in
balance
his
fault
with
his
perfection
,
the
latter
seem
rather
to
preponderate
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
to
no
purpose
,
therefore
,
that
Thwackum
,
who
be
immediately
charge
by
Mr
Blifil
with
the
story
,
unbend
all
his
rancour
against
poor
Tom
.
<EOS>
Allworthy
give
a
patient
hearing
to
their
invective
,
and
then
answer
coldly
:
"
that
young
man
of
Tom
's
complexion
be
too
generally
addict
to
this
vice
;
but
he
believe
that
youth
be
sincerely
affected
with
what
he
have
say
to
him
on
the
occasion
,
and
he
hope
he
would
not
transgress
again
.
"
<EOS>
so
that
,
as
the
day
of
whipping
be
at
an
end
,
the
tutor
have
no
other
vent
but
his
own
mouth
for
his
gall
,
the
usual
poor
resource
of
impotent
revenge
.
  
<EOS>
but
Square
,
who
be
a
less
violent
,
be
a
much
more
artful
man
;
and
as
he
hate
Jones
more
perhaps
than
Thwackum
himself
do
,
so
he
contrive
to
do
him
more
mischief
in
the
mind
of
Mr
Allworthy
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
must
remember
the
several
little
incident
of
the
partridge
,
the
horse
,
and
the
Bible
,
which
be
recount
in
the
second
book
.
<EOS>
by
all
which
Jones
have
rather
improve
than
injure
the
affection
which
Mr
Allworthy
be
incline
to
entertain
for
him
.
<EOS>
the
same
,
I
believe
,
must
have
happen
to
him
with
every
other
person
who
hath
any
idea
of
friendship
,
generosity
,
and
greatness
of
spirit
,
that
be
to
say
,
who
hath
any
trace
of
goodness
in
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
Square
himself
be
not
unacquainted
with
the
true
impression
which
those
several
instance
of
goodness
have
make
on
the
excellent
heart
of
Allworthy
;
for
the
philosopher
very
well
know
what
virtue
be
,
though
he
be
not
always
perhaps
steady
in
its
pursuit
;
but
as
for
Thwackum
,
from
what
reason
I
will
not
determine
,
no
such
thought
ever
enter
into
his
head
:
he
see
Jones
in
a
bad
light
,
and
he
imagine
<EOS>
Allworthy
see
him
in
the
same
,
but
that
he
be
resolve
,
from
pride
and
stubbornness
of
spirit
,
not
to
give
up
the
boy
whom
he
have
once
cherish
;
since
by
so
do
,
he
must
tacitly
acknowledge
that
his
former
opinion
of
him
have
be
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
Square
therefore
embrace
this
opportunity
of
injure
Jones
in
the
tender
part
,
by
give
a
very
bad
turn
to
all
these
before
-
mention
occurrence
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
to
own
I
have
be
deceive
as
well
as
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
,
I
confess
,
help
be
pleased
with
what
I
ascribe
to
the
motive
of
friendship
,
though
it
be
carry
to
an
excess
,
and
all
excess
be
faulty
and
vicious
:
<EOS>
but
in
this
I
make
allowance
for
youth
.
<EOS>
little
do
I
suspect
that
the
sacrifice
of
truth
,
which
we
both
imagine
to
have
be
make
to
friendship
,
be
in
reality
a
prostitution
of
it
to
a
depraved
and
debauch
appetite
.
<EOS>
You
now
plainly
see
whence
all
the
seeming
generosity
of
this
young
man
to
the
family
of
the
gamekeeper
proceed
.
<EOS>
He
support
the
father
in
order
to
corrupt
the
daughter
,
and
preserve
the
family
from
starve
,
to
bring
one
of
them
to
shame
and
ruin
.
<EOS>
this
be
friendship
!
<EOS>
this
be
generosity
!
<EOS>
as
Sir
Richard
Steele
say
,
"
glutton
who
give
high
price
for
delicacy
,
be
very
worthy
to
be
call
generous
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
short
I
be
resolve
,
from
this
instance
,
never
to
give
way
to
the
weakness
of
human
nature
more
,
nor
to
think
anything
virtue
which
doth
not
exactly
quadrate
with
the
unerring
rule
of
right
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
goodness
of
Allworthy
have
prevent
those
consideration
from
occur
to
himself
;
yet
be
they
too
plausible
to
be
absolutely
and
hastily
reject
,
when
lay
before
his
eye
by
another
.
<EOS>
indeed
what
Square
have
say
sink
very
deeply
into
his
mind
,
and
the
uneasiness
which
it
there
create
be
very
visible
to
the
other
;
though
the
good
man
would
not
acknowledge
this
,
but
make
a
very
slight
answer
,
and
forcibly
drive
off
the
discourse
to
some
other
subject
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
perhaps
for
poor
Tom
,
that
no
such
suggestion
have
be
make
before
he
be
pardon
;
for
they
certainly
stamp
in
the
mind
of
Allworthy
the
first
bad
impression
concern
Jones
.
    
<EOS>
contain
much
clear
matter
;
but
which
flow
from
the
same
fountain
with
those
in
the
precede
chapter
.
 
<EOS>
the
reader
will
be
pleased
,
I
believe
,
to
return
with
me
to
Sophia
.
<EOS>
She
pass
the
night
,
after
we
see
her
last
,
in
no
very
agreeable
manner
.
<EOS>
Sleep
befriend
her
but
little
,
and
dream
less
.
<EOS>
in
the
morning
,
when
Mrs
Honour
,
her
maid
,
attend
her
at
the
usual
hour
,
she
be
find
already
up
and
dr
.
  
<EOS>
person
who
live
two
or
three
mile
'
distance
in
the
country
be
consider
as
next
-
door
neighbour
,
and
transaction
at
the
one
house
fly
with
incredible
celerity
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Honour
,
therefore
,
have
hear
the
whole
story
of
Molly
's
shame
;
which
she
,
be
of
a
very
communicative
temper
,
have
no
sooner
enter
the
apartment
of
her
mistress
,
than
she
begin
to
relate
in
the
follow
manner
:
    
"
La
,
madam
,
what
doth
<EOS>
your
la'ship
think
?
<EOS>
the
girl
that
your
la'ship
see
at
church
on
Sunday
,
whom
you
think
so
handsome
;
though
you
would
not
have
think
her
so
handsome
<EOS>
neither
,
if
you
have
see
her
nearer
,
but
to
be
sure
she
hath
be
carry
before
the
justice
for
be
big
with
child
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
me
to
look
like
a
confident
slut
:
and
to
be
sure
she
hath
lay
the
child
to
young
Mr
Jones
.
<EOS>
and
all
the
parish
say
Mr
Allworthy
be
so
angry
with
young
Mr
Jones
,
that
he
will
not
see
him
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
one
can
not
help
pity
the
poor
young
man
,
and
yet
he
doth
not
deserve
much
pity
neither
,
for
demean
himself
with
such
kind
of
trumpery
.
<EOS>
yet
he
be
so
pretty
a
gentleman
<EOS>
,
I
should
be
sorry
to
have
him
turn
out
of
door
.
<EOS>
I
dare
to
swear
the
wench
be
as
willing
as
he
;
for
she
be
always
a
forward
kind
of
body
.
<EOS>
and
when
wench
be
so
coming
,
young
man
be
not
so
much
to
be
blame
neither
;
for
to
be
sure
they
do
no
more
than
what
be
natural
.
<EOS>
indeed
it
be
beneath
them
to
meddle
with
such
dirty
draggle
-
tail
;
and
whatever
happen
to
them
,
it
be
good
enough
for
them
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
to
be
sure
,
the
vile
baggage
be
most
in
fault
.
<EOS>
I
wish
,
with
all
my
heart
,
they
be
well
to
be
whip
at
the
cart
's
tail
;
for
it
be
pity
they
should
be
the
ruin
of
a
pretty
young
gentleman
;
and
nobody
can
deny
but
that
Mr
Jones
be
one
of
the
most
handsome
young
man
that
ever
"
  
She
be
run
on
thus
,
when
Sophia
,
with
a
more
peevish
voice
than
she
have
ever
speak
to
her
in
before
,
cry
,
"
Prithee
,
why
dost
thou
trouble
me
with
all
this
stuff
?
<EOS>
what
concern
have
I
in
what
Mr
Jones
doth
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
be
all
alike
.
<EOS>
and
you
seem
to
me
to
be
angry
it
be
not
your
own
case
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
,
madam
!
"
answer
Mrs
Honour
,
"
I
be
sorry
your
ladyship
should
have
such
an
opinion
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
nobody
can
say
any
such
thing
of
me
.
<EOS>
all
the
young
fellow
in
the
world
may
go
to
the
divil
for
me
.
<EOS>
because
I
say
he
be
a
handsome
man
?
<EOS>
everybody
say
it
as
well
as
I.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
I
never
think
as
it
be
any
harm
to
say
a
young
man
be
handsome
;
but
to
be
sure
I
shall
never
think
him
so
any
more
now
;
for
handsome
be
that
handsome
do
.
<EOS>
a
beggar
wench
!
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
stop
thy
torrent
of
impertinence
,
"
cry
Sophia
,
"
and
see
whether
my
father
want
me
at
breakfast
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Honour
then
fling
out
of
the
room
,
mutter
much
to
herself
,
of
which
"
Marry
come
up
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
"
be
all
that
could
be
plainly
distinguish
.
  
<EOS>
whether
Mrs
Honour
really
deserve
that
suspicion
,
of
which
her
mistress
give
her
a
hint
,
be
a
matter
which
we
can
not
indulge
our
reader
's
curiosity
by
resolve
.
<EOS>
We
will
,
however
,
make
him
amend
in
disclose
what
pass
in
the
mind
of
Sophia
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
will
be
pleased
to
recollect
,
that
a
secret
affection
for
Mr
Jones
have
insensibly
steal
into
the
bosom
of
this
young
lady
.
<EOS>
that
it
have
there
grow
to
a
pretty
great
height
before
she
herself
have
discover
it
.
<EOS>
when
she
first
begin
to
perceive
its
symptom
,
the
sensation
be
so
sweet
and
pleasing
,
that
she
have
not
resolution
sufficient
to
check
or
repel
them
;
and
thus
she
go
on
cherish
a
passion
of
which
she
never
once
consider
the
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
this
incident
relate
to
Molly
first
open
her
eye
.
<EOS>
She
now
first
perceive
the
weakness
of
which
she
have
be
guilty
;
and
though
it
cause
the
utmost
perturbation
in
her
mind
,
yet
it
have
the
effect
of
other
nauseous
physic
,
and
for
the
time
expel
her
distemper
.
<EOS>
Its
operation
indeed
be
most
wonderfully
quick
;
and
in
the
short
interval
,
while
her
maid
be
absent
,
so
entirely
remove
all
symptom
,
that
when
Mrs
Honour
return
with
a
summon
from
her
father
,
she
be
become
perfectly
easy
,
and
have
bring
herself
to
a
thorough
indifference
for
Mr
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
the
disease
of
the
mind
do
in
almost
every
particular
imitate
those
of
the
body
.
<EOS>
for
which
reason
,
we
hope
,
that
learn
faculty
,
for
whom
we
have
so
profound
a
respect
,
will
pardon
us
the
violent
hand
we
have
be
necessitate
to
lay
on
several
word
and
phrase
,
which
of
right
belong
to
them
,
and
without
which
our
description
must
have
be
often
unintelligible
.
  
<EOS>
now
there
be
no
one
circumstance
in
which
the
distemper
of
the
mind
bear
a
more
exact
analogy
to
those
which
be
call
bodily
,
than
that
aptness
which
both
have
to
a
relapse
.
<EOS>
this
be
plain
in
the
violent
disease
of
ambition
and
avarice
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
ambition
,
when
cure
at
court
by
frequent
disappointment
(
which
be
the
only
physic
for
it
)
,
to
break
out
again
in
a
contest
for
foreman
of
the
grand
jury
at
an
assizes
;
and
have
hear
of
a
man
who
have
so
far
conquered
avarice
,
as
to
give
away
many
a
sixpence
,
that
comfort
himself
,
at
last
,
on
his
deathbed
,
by
make
a
crafty
and
advantageous
bargain
concern
his
ensue
funeral
,
with
an
undertaker
who
have
marry
his
only
child
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
affair
of
love
,
which
,
out
of
strict
conformity
with
the
stoic
philosophy
,
we
shall
here
treat
as
a
disease
,
this
proneness
to
relapse
be
no
less
conspicuous
.
<EOS>
thus
it
happen
to
poor
Sophia
;
upon
whom
,
the
very
next
time
she
see
young
Jones
,
all
the
former
symptom
return
,
and
from
that
time
cold
and
hot
fit
alternately
seize
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
the
situation
of
this
young
lady
be
now
very
different
from
what
it
have
ever
be
before
.
<EOS>
that
passion
which
have
formerly
be
so
exquisitely
delicious
,
become
now
a
scorpion
in
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
She
resist
it
therefore
with
her
utmost
force
,
and
summon
every
argument
her
reason
(
which
be
surprisingly
strong
for
her
age
)
could
suggest
,
to
subdue
and
expel
it
.
<EOS>
in
this
she
so
far
succeeded
,
that
she
begin
to
hope
from
time
and
absence
a
perfect
cure
.
<EOS>
She
resolve
therefore
to
avoid
Tom
Jones
as
much
as
possible
;
for
which
purpose
she
begin
to
conceive
a
design
of
visit
her
aunt
,
to
which
she
make
no
doubt
of
obtain
her
father
's
consent
.
  
<EOS>
but
Fortune
,
who
have
other
design
in
her
head
,
put
an
immediate
stop
to
any
such
proceeding
,
by
introduce
an
accident
,
which
will
be
relate
in
the
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
a
dreadful
accident
which
befel
Sophia
.
<EOS>
the
gallant
behaviour
of
Jones
,
and
the
more
dreadful
consequence
of
that
behaviour
to
the
young
lady
;
with
a
short
digression
in
favour
of
the
female
sex
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Western
grow
every
day
fonder
and
fonder
of
Sophia
,
insomuch
that
his
beloved
dog
themselves
almost
give
place
to
her
in
his
affection
;
but
as
he
could
not
prevail
on
himself
to
abandon
these
,
he
contrive
very
cunningly
to
enjoy
their
company
,
together
with
that
of
his
daughter
,
by
insist
on
her
ride
a
hunting
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
,
to
whom
her
father
's
word
be
a
law
,
readily
comply
with
his
desire
,
though
she
have
not
the
least
delight
in
a
sport
,
which
be
of
too
rough
and
masculine
a
nature
to
suit
with
her
disposition
.
<EOS>
She
have
however
another
motive
,
beside
her
obedience
,
to
accompany
the
old
gentleman
in
the
chase
;
for
by
her
presence
she
hope
in
some
measure
to
restrain
his
impetuosity
,
and
to
prevent
him
from
so
frequently
expose
his
neck
to
the
utmost
hazard
.
  
<EOS>
the
strong
objection
be
that
which
would
have
formerly
be
an
inducement
to
her
,
namely
,
the
frequent
meeting
with
young
Jones
,
whom
she
have
determine
to
avoid
;
but
as
the
end
of
the
hunting
season
now
approach
,
she
hope
,
by
a
short
absence
with
her
aunt
,
to
reason
herself
entirely
out
of
her
unfortunate
passion
;
and
have
not
any
doubt
of
be
able
to
meet
him
in
the
field
the
subsequent
season
without
the
least
danger
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
second
day
of
her
hunting
,
as
she
be
return
from
the
chase
,
and
be
arrive
within
a
little
distance
from
Mr
Western
's
house
,
her
horse
,
whose
mettlesome
spirit
require
a
well
rider
,
fall
suddenly
to
prance
and
caper
in
such
a
manner
that
she
be
in
the
most
imminent
peril
of
fall
.
<EOS>
Tom
Jones
,
who
be
at
a
little
distance
behind
,
see
this
,
and
immediately
gallop
up
to
her
assistance
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
come
up
,
he
leap
from
his
own
horse
,
and
catch
hold
of
her
by
the
bridle
.
<EOS>
the
unruly
beast
presently
rear
himself
an
end
on
his
hind
leg
,
and
throw
his
lovely
burthen
from
his
back
,
and
Jones
catch
her
in
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
so
affected
with
the
fright
,
that
she
be
not
immediately
able
to
satisfy
Jones
,
who
be
very
sollicitous
to
know
whether
she
have
receive
any
hurt
.
<EOS>
She
soon
after
,
however
,
recover
her
spirit
,
assure
him
she
be
safe
,
and
thank
him
for
the
care
he
have
take
of
her
.
<EOS>
Jones
answer
,
"
if
I
have
preserve
you
,
madam
,
I
be
sufficiently
repay
;
for
I
promise
you
,
I
would
have
secure
you
from
the
least
harm
at
the
expense
of
a
much
great
misfortune
to
myself
than
I
have
suffer
on
this
occasion
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
misfortune
?
<EOS>
"
reply
Sophia
eagerly
;
"
I
hope
you
have
come
to
no
mischief
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
be
not
concerned
,
madam
,
"
answer
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
Heaven
be
praise
you
have
escape
so
well
,
consider
the
danger
you
be
in
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
break
my
arm
,
I
consider
it
as
a
trifle
,
in
comparison
of
what
I
fear
upon
your
account
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sophia
then
scream
out
,
"
broke
your
arm
!
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
I
have
,
madam
,
"
say
Jones
:
"
<EOS>
but
I
beg
you
will
suffer
me
first
to
take
care
of
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
right
hand
yet
at
your
service
,
to
help
you
into
the
next
field
,
whence
we
have
but
a
very
little
walk
to
your
father
's
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sophia
see
his
left
arm
dangle
by
his
side
,
while
he
be
use
the
other
to
lead
her
,
no
longer
doubt
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
She
now
grow
much
paler
than
her
fear
for
herself
have
make
her

all
her
limb
be
seize
with
a
tremble

insomuch
that
Jones
could
scarce
support
her
;
and
as
her
thought
be
in
no
less
agitation
,
she
could
not
refrain
from
give
Jones
a
look
so
full
of
tenderness
,
that
it
almost
argue
a
strong
sensation
in
her
mind
,
than
even
gratitude
and
pity
united
can
raise
in
the
gentle
female
bosom
,
without
the
assistance
of
a
third
more
powerful
passion
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Western
,
who
be
advance
at
some
distance
when
this
accident
happen
,
be
now
return
,
as
be
the
rest
of
the
horseman
.
<EOS>
Sophia
immediately
acquaint
them
with
what
have
befall
Jones
,
and
beg
them
to
take
care
of
him
.
<EOS>
upon
which
Western
,
who
have
be
much
alarm
by
meet
his
daughter
's
horse
without
its
rider
,
and
be
now
overjoyed
to
find
her
unhurt
,
cry
out
,
"
I
be
glad
it
be
no
bad

<EOS>
if
Tom
hath
break
his

,
we
will
get

"
  
<EOS>
the
squire
alight
from
his
horse
,
and
proceed
to
his
house
on
foot
,
with
his
daughter
and
Jones
.
<EOS>
an
impartial
spectator
,
who
have
meet
them
on
the
way
,
<EOS>
would
,
on
view
their
several
countenance
,
have
conclude
Sophia
alone
to
have
be
the
object
of
compassion
:
for
as
to
Jones
,
he
exult
in
have
probably
save
the
life
of
the
young
lady
,
at
the
price
only
of
a
broken
bone
;
and
<EOS>
Mr
Western
,
though
he
be
not
unconcerned
at
the
accident
which
have
befall
Jones
,
be
,
however
,
delight
in
a
much
high
degree
with
the
fortunate
escape
of
his
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
the
generosity
of
Sophia
's
temper
construe
this
behaviour
of
Jones
into
great
bravery
;
and
it
make
a
deep
impression
on
her
heart
:
for
certain
it
be
,
that
there
be
no
one
quality
which
so
generally
recommend
man
to
woman
as
this
;
proceeding
,
if
we
believe
the
common
opinion
,
from
that
natural
timidity
of
the
sex
,
which
be
,
say
Mr
Osborne
,
"
so
great
,
that
a
woman
be
the
most
cowardly
of
all
the
creature
God
ever
make
;
"
 
a
sentiment
more
remarkable
for
its
bluntness
than
for
its
truth
.
<EOS>
Aristotle
,
in
his
Politics
,
doth
them
,
I
believe
,
more
justice
,
when
he
say
,
"
the
modesty
and
fortitude
of
man
differ
from
those
virtue
in
woman
;
for
the
fortitude
which
become
a
woman
,
would
be
cowardice
in
a
man
;
and
the
modesty
which
become
a
man
,
would
be
pertnes
in
a
woman
.
<EOS>
"
nor
be
there
,
perhaps
,
more
of
truth
in
the
opinion
of
those
who
derive
the
partiality
which
woman
be
inclined
to
show
to
the
brave
,
from
this
excess
of
their
fear
.
<EOS>
Mr
Bayle
(
I
think
,
in
his
article
of
Helen
)
impute
this
,
and
with
great
probability
,
to
their
violent
love
of
glory
;
for
the
truth
of
which
,
we
have
the
authority
of
him
who
of
all
other
see
farthest
into
human
nature
,
and
who
introduce
the
heroine
of
his
Odyssey
,
the
great
pattern
of
matrimonial
love
and
constancy
,
assign
the
glory
of
her
husband
as
the
only
source
of
her
affection
towards
him
.

the

will
not
find
this
in

for
the
  
sentiment
be
entirely
leave
out
in
the
translation

<EOS>
however
this
be
,
<EOS>
certain
it
be
that
the
accident
operate
very
strongly
on
Sophia
;
and
,
indeed
,
after
much
enquiry
into
the
matter
,
I
be
incline
to
believe
,
that
,
at
this
very
time
,
the
charming
Sophia
make
no
less
impression
on
the
heart
of
Jones
;
to
say
truth
,
he
have
for
some
time
become
sensible
of
the
irresistible
power
of
her
charm
.
    
<EOS>
the
arrival
of
a
surgeon
.
 
<EOS>
His
operation
,
and
a
long
dialogue
between
Sophia
and
her
maid
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
arrive
at
Mr
Western
's
hall
,
Sophia
,
who
have
totter
along
with
much
difficulty
,
sink
down
in
her
chair
;
but
by
the
assistance
of
hartshorn
and
water
,
she
be
prevent
from
faint
away
,
and
have
pretty
well
recover
her
spirit
,
when
the
surgeon
who
be
send
for
to
Jones
appear
.
<EOS>
Mr
Western
,
who
impute
these
symptom
in
his
daughter
to
her
fall
,
advise
her
to
be
presently
blood
by
way
of
prevention
.
<EOS>
in
this
opinion
he
be
second
by
the
surgeon
,
who
give
so
many
reason
for
bleeding
,
and
quote
so
many
case
where
person
have
miscarry
for
want
of
it
,
that
the
squire
become
very
importunate
,
and
indeed
insist
peremptorily
that
his
daughter
should
be
blooded
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
soon
yield
to
the
command
of
her
father
,
though
entirely
contrary
to
her
own
inclination
,
for
she
suspect
,
I
believe
,
less
danger
from
the
fright
,
than
either
the
squire
or
the
surgeon
.
<EOS>
She
then
stretch
out
her
beautiful
arm
,
and
the
operator
begin
to
prepare
for
his
work
.
  
<EOS>
while
the
servant
be
busy
in
provide
material
,
the
surgeon
,
who
impute
the
backwardness
which
have
appear
in
Sophia
to
her
fear
,
begin
to
comfort
her
with
assurance
that
there
be
not
the
least
danger
;
for
no
accident
,
he
say
,
could
ever
happen
in
bleeding
,
but
from
the
monstrous
ignorance
of
pretender
to
surgery
,
which
he
pretty
plainly
insinuate
be
not
at
present
to
be
apprehend
.
<EOS>
Sophia
declare
she
be
not
under
the
least
apprehension
;
add
,
"
if
you
open
an
artery
,
I
promise
you
I
will
forgive
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
Will
you
?
"
cry
Western
:
"
D####n
me
,
if
I
will
.
<EOS>
if
he
do
thee
the
least
mischief
,
d####n
me
if
I
do
not
ha
'
the
heart
's
blood
<EOS>
o'un
out
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
surgeon
assent
to
bleed
her
upon
these
condition
,
and
then
proceed
to
his
operation
,
which
he
perform
with
as
much
dexterity
as
he
have
promise
;
and
with
as
much
quickness
:
for
he
take
but
little
blood
from
her
,
say
,
it
be
much
safe
to
bleed
again
and
again
,
than
to
take
away
too
much
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
,
when
her
arm
be
bind
up
,
retire
:
for
she
be
not
willing
(
nor
be
it
,
perhaps
,
strictly
decent
)
to
be
present
at
the
operation
on
Jones
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
one
objection
which
she
have
to
bleed
(
though
she
do
not
make
it
)
be
the
delay
which
it
would
occasion
to
set
the
broken
bone
.
<EOS>
for
Western
,
when
Sophia
be
concern
,
have
no
consideration
but
for
her
;
and
as
for
Jones
himself
,
he
"
sit
like
patience
on
a
monument
smile
at
grief
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
when
he
see
the
blood
spring
from
the
lovely
arm
of
Sophia
,
he
scarce
thought
of
what
have
happen
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
the
surgeon
now
order
his
patient
to
be
stript
to
his
shirt
,
and
then
entirely
bare
the
arm
,
he
begin
to
stretch
and
examine
it
,
in
such
a
manner
that
the
torture
he
put
him
to
cause
Jones
to
make
several
wry
face
;
which
the
surgeon
observe
,
greatly
wonder
at
,
cry
,
"
what
be
the
matter
,
sir
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
it
be
impossible
<EOS>
I
should
hurt
you
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
hold
forth
the
broken
arm
,
he
begin
a
long
and
very
learned
lecture
of
anatomy
,
in
which
simple
and
double
fracture
be
most
accurately
consider
;
and
the
several
way
in
which
Jones
may
have
break
his
arm
be
discuss
,
with
proper
annotation
show
how
many
of
these
would
have
be
well
,
and
how
many
bad
than
the
present
case
.
  
<EOS>
have
at
length
finish
his
laboured
harangue
,
with
which
the
audience
,
though
it
have
greatly
raise
their
attention
and
admiration
,
be
not
much
edify
,
as
they
really
understand
not
a
single
syllable
of
all
he
have
say
,
he
proceed
to
business
,
which
he
be
more
expeditious
in
finishing
,
than
he
have
be
in
beginning
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
be
then
order
into
a
bed
,
which
Mr
Western
compel
him
to
accept
at
his
own
house
,
and
sentence
of
water
-
gruel
be
pass
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
among
the
good
company
which
have
attend
in
the
hall
during
the
bone
-
setting
,
Mrs
Honour
be
one
;
who
be
summon
to
her
mistress
as
soon
as
it
be
over
,
and
ask
by
her
how
the
young
gentleman
do
,
presently
launch
into
extravagant
praise
on
the
magnanimity
,
as
she
call
it
,
of
his
behaviour
,
which
,
she
say
,
"
be
so
charming
in
so
pretty
a
creature
.
<EOS>
"
She
then
burst
forth
into
much
warm
encomium
on
the
beauty
of
his
person
;
enumerate
many
particular
,
and
end
with
the
whiteness
of
his
skin
.
  
<EOS>
this
discourse
have
an
effect
on
Sophia
's
countenance
,
which
would
not
perhaps
have
escape
the
observance
of
the
sagacious
waiting
-
woman
,
have
she
once
look
her
mistress
in
the
face
,
all
the
time
she
be
speak
:
but
as
a
looking
-
glass
,
which
be
most
commodiously
place
opposite
to
her
,
give
her
an
opportunity
of
survey
those
feature
,
in
which
,
of
all
other
,
she
take
most
delight
;
so
she
have
not
once
remove
her
eye
from
that
amiable
object
during
her
whole
speech
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Honour
be
so
intirely
wrap
up
in
the
subject
on
which
she
exercise
her
tongue
,
and
the
object
before
her
eye
,
that
she
give
her
mistress
time
to
conquer
her
confusion
;
which
have
do
,
she
smile
on
her
maid
,
and
tell
her
,
"
she
be
certainly
in
love
with
this
young
fellow

<EOS>
"
I
in

"
why

if
you

cry
her
mistress

"
<EOS>
I
see
no
reason

you
should
be
ashamed

for
he
be
certainly
a
pretty
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
madam
,
"
answer
the
other
,
"
that
he
be
,
the
most
handsome
man
I
ever
see
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
yes
,
to
be
sure
,
that
he
be
,
and
,
as
your
ladyship
say
,
I
do
not
know
why
I
should
be
ashamed
of
love
him
,
though
he
be
my
better

<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
gentlefolk
be
but
flesh

blood
no

us
servant

<EOS>
besides
,
as
for
Mr
Jones
,
thof
Squire
Allworthy
hath
make
a
gentleman
of
him
,
he
be
not
so
good
as
myself
by
birth
:
for
thof
I
be
a
poor
body
,
I
be
an
honest
person
's
child
,
and
my
father
and
mother
be
marry
,
which
be
more
than
some
people
can
say
,
as
high
as
they
hold
their
head
.
<EOS>
marry
,
come
up
!
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
my
dirty
cousin
!
<EOS>
thof
his
skin
be
so
white
,
and
to
be
sure
it
be
the
most
white
that
ever
be
see
,
I
be
a
Christian
as
well
as
he
,
and
nobody
can
say
that
I
be
base
bear
:
my
grandfather
be
a
clergyman
,
[

and
would
have
be
very
angry
,
I
believe
,
to
have
think
any
of
his
family
should
have
take
up
with
Molly
Seagrim
's
dirty
leaving
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
[

<EOS>
this
be
the
second
person
of
low
condition
whom
we
have
record
  
in
this
history
to
have
spring
from
the
clergy

<EOS>
It
be
to
be
hope
  
such
instance
will
,
in
future
age
,
when
some
provision
be
make
for
  
the
family
of
the
inferior
clergy
,
appear
strange
than
they
can
  
be
think
at
present

<EOS>
perhaps
Sophia
may
have
suffer
her
maid
to
run
on
in
this
manner
,
from
want
sufficient
spirit
to
stop
her
tongue
,
which
the
reader
may
probably
conjecture
be
no
very
easy
task
;
for
certainly
there
be
some
passage
in
her
speech
which
be
far
from
be
agreeable
to
the
lady
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
now
check
the
torrent
,
as
there
seem
no
end
of
its
flow

<EOS>
"
I
wonder

say
she

"
at
your
assurance

I
order

those

<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
hate
Molly

I
can
call

very
muff
your
ladyship
give
me
but
yesterday
.
<EOS>
La
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
Mr
Jones
,
you
will
stretch
my
lady
's
muff
,
and
spoil
it
:
but
he
still
keep
his
hand
in
it
:
<EOS>
and
then
he
kiss
it
 
to
be
sure
I
hardly
ever
see
such
a
kiss
in
my
life
as
he
give
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
do
not
know
it
be
mine

"
reply
Sophia

<EOS>
"
Your
ladyship
shall
hear
,
madam

<EOS>
He
kiss
it
again
and
again
,
and
say
it
be
the
pretty
muff
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
La
!
<EOS>
sir
,
say
I
,
you
have
see
it
a
hundred
time
.
<EOS>
yes
,
Mrs
Honour
,
cry
he
;
but
who
can
see
anything
beautiful
in
the
presence
of
your
lady
but
herself
?
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
that
be
not
all
neither
;
but
I
hope
your
ladyship
will
not
be
offend
,
for
to
be
sure
he
mean
nothing
.
<EOS>
one
day
,
as
your
ladyship
be
play
on
the
harpsichord
to
my
master
,
Mr
Jones
be
sit
in
the
next
room
,
and
methought
he
look
melancholy
.
<EOS>
La
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
Mr
Jones
,
what
be
the
matter
?
<EOS>
a
penny
for
your
thought
,
say
I.
Why
,
hussy
,
say
he
,
start
up
from
a
dream
,
what
can
I
be
think
of
,
when
that
angel
your
mistress
be
play
?
<EOS>
and
then
squeeze
me
by
the
hand
,
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Mrs
Honour
,
say
he
,
how
happy
will
that
man
be
!
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
sigh
.
<EOS>
upon
my
troth
,
his
breath
be
as
sweet
as
a
nosegay

<EOS>
but
to
be
sure
he
mean
no
harm
by
it
.
<EOS>
so
I
hope
your
ladyship
will
not
mention
a
word
;
for
he
give
me
a
crown
never
to
mention
it
,
and
make
me
swear
upon
a
book
,
but
I
believe
,
indeed
,
it
be
not
the
Bible

<EOS>
till
something

a
more
beautiful

I

nothing

yes

this

some

<EOS>
here
the
dinner
bell
interrupt
a
conversation
which
have
work
such
an
effect
on
Sophia
,
that
she
be
,
perhaps
,
more
obliged
to
her
bleeding
in
the

than
she

at

have
apprehend
she

as

the

I

a
rule
of
Horace

by
not

from
despair
of
success

<EOS>
Most
of
my

will
suggest
it
easily
to
themselves
;
and
the
few
who
can
not

would
not

<EOS>
BOOK
V.
  
<EOS>
contain
a
portion
of
time
<EOS>
SOMEWHAT
longer
<EOS>
than
<EOS>
half
a
year
.
    
<EOS>
of
the
SERIOUS
in
writing
,
and
for
what
purpose
it
be
introduce
.
 
<EOS>
Peradventure
there
may
be
no
part
in
this
prodigious
work
which
will
give
the
reader
less
pleasure
in
the
perusing
,
than
those
which
have
give
the
author
the
great
pain
in
compose
.
<EOS>
among
these
probably
may
be
reckon
those
initial
essay
which
we
have
prefix
to
the
historical
matter
contain
in
every
book
;
and
which
we
have
determine
to
be
essentially
necessary
to
this
kind
of
writing
,
of
which
we
have
set
ourselves
at
the
head
.
  
<EOS>
for
this
our
determination
we
do
not
hold
ourselves
strictly
bind
to
assign
any
reason
;
it
be
abundantly
sufficient
that
we
have
lay
it
down
as
a
rule
necessary
to
be
observe
in
all
prosai
-
comi
-
epic
writing
.
<EOS>
who
ever
demand
the
reason
of
that
nice
unity
of
time
or
place
which
be
now
establish
to
be
so
essential
to
dramatic
poetry
?
<EOS>
what
critic
hath
be
ever
ask
,
why
a
play
may
not
contain
two
day
as
well
as
one
?
<EOS>
or
why
the
audience
(
provide
they
travel
,
like
elector
,
without
any
expense
)
<EOS>
may
not
be
waft
fifty
mile
as
well
as
five
?
<EOS>
Hath
any
commentator
well
account
for
the
limitation
which
an
antient
critic
hath
set
to
the
drama
,
which
he
will
have
contain
neither
more
nor
less
than
five
act
?
<EOS>
or
hath
any
one
living
attempt
to
explain
what
the
modern
judge
of
our
theatre
mean
by
that
word
low
;
by
which
they
have
happily
succeed
in
banish
all
humour
from
the
stage
,
and
have
make
the
theatre
as
dull
as
a
drawing
-
room
!
<EOS>
upon
all
these
occasion
the
world
seem
to
have
embrace
a
maxim
of
our
law
,
viz
.
,
cuicunque
in
arte
sua
perito
credendum
est
:
<EOS>
for
it
seem
perhaps
difficult
to
conceive
that
any
one
should
have
have
enough
of
impudence
to
lay
down
dogmatical
rule
in
any
art
or
science
without
the
least
foundation
.
<EOS>
in
such
case
,
therefore
,
we
be
apt
to
conclude
there
be
sound
and
good
reason
at
the
bottom
,
though
we
be
unfortunately
not
able
to
see
so
far
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
in
reality
,
the
world
have
pay
too
great
a
compliment
to
critic
,
and
have
imagine
them
man
of
much
great
profundity
than
they
really
be
.
<EOS>
from
this
complacence
,
the
critic
have
be
embolden
to
assume
a
dictatorial
power
,
and
have
so
far
succeed
,
that
they
be
now
become
the
master
,
and
have
the
assurance
to
give
law
to
those
author
from
whose
predecessor
they
originally
receive
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
critic
,
rightly
consider
,
be
no
more
than
the
clerk
,
whose
office
it
be
to
transcribe
the
rule
and
law
lay
down
by
those
great
judge
whose
vast
strength
of
genius
hath
place
them
in
the
light
of
legislator
,
in
the
several
science
over
which
they
preside
.
<EOS>
this
office
be
all
which
the
critic
of
old
aspire
to
;
nor
do
they
ever
dare
to
advance
a
sentence
,
without
support
it
by
the
authority
of
the
judge
from
whence
it
be
borrow
.
  
<EOS>
but
in
process
of
time
,
and
in
age
of
ignorance
,
the
clerk
begin
to
invade
the
power
and
assume
the
dignity
of
his
master
.
<EOS>
the
law
of
writing
be
no
longer
found
on
the
practice
of
the
author
,
but
on
the
dictate
of
the
critic
.
<EOS>
the
clerk
become
the
legislator
,
and
those
very
peremptorily
give
law
whose
business
it
be
,
at
first
,
only
to
transcribe
them
.
  
<EOS>
hence
arise
an
obvious
,
and
perhaps
an
unavoidable
error
;
for
these
critic
be
man
of
shallow
capacity
,
very
easily
mistake
mere
form
for
substance
.
<EOS>
They
act
as
a
judge
would
,
who
should
adhere
to
the
lifeless
letter
of
law
,
and
reject
the
spirit
.
<EOS>
little
circumstance
,
which
be
perhaps
accidental
in
a
great
author
,
be
by
these
critic
consider
to
constitute
his
chief
merit
,
and
transmit
as
essential
to
be
observe
by
all
his
successor
.
<EOS>
to
these
encroachment
,
time
and
ignorance
,
the
two
great
supporter
of
imposture
,
give
authority
;
and
thus
many
rule
for
good
writing
have
be
establish
,
which
have
not
the
least
foundation
in
truth
or
nature
;
and
which
commonly
serve
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
curb
and
restrain
genius
,
in
the
same
manner
as
it
would
have
restrain
the
dancing
-
master
,
<EOS>
have
the
many
excellent
treatise
on
that
art
lay
it
down
as
an
essential
rule
that
every
man
must
dance
in
chain
.
  
<EOS>
to
avoid
,
therefore
,
all
imputation
of
lay
down
a
rule
for
posterity
,
found
only
on
the
authority
of
ipse
dixit
 
for
which
,
to
say
the
truth
,
we
have
not
the
profound
veneration
 
<EOS>
we
shall
here
waive
the
privilege
above
contend
for
,
and
proceed
to
lay
before
the
reader
the
reason
which
have
induce
us
to
intersperse
these
several
digressive
essay
in
the
course
of
this
work
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
we
shall
of
necessity
be
lead
to
open
a
new
vein
of
knowledge
,
which
if
it
hath
be
discover
,
hath
not
,
to
our
remembrance
,
be
work
on
by
any
antient
or
modern
writer
.
<EOS>
this
vein
be
no
other
than
that
of
contrast
,
which
run
through
all
the
work
of
the
creation
,
and
may
probably
have
a
large
share
in
constitute
in
us
the
idea
of
all
beauty
,
as
well
natural
as
artificial
:
for
what
demonstrate
the
beauty
and
excellence
of
anything
but
its
reverse
?
<EOS>
thus
the
beauty
of
day
,
and
that
of
summer
,
be
set
off
by
the
horror
of
night
and
winter
.
<EOS>
and
,
I
believe
,
if
it
be
possible
for
a
man
to
have
see
only
the
two
former
,
he
would
have
a
very
imperfect
idea
of
their
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
avoid
too
serious
an
air
;
can
it
be
doubt
,
but
that
the
fine
woman
in
the
world
would
lose
all
benefit
of
her
charm
in
the
eye
of
a
man
who
have
never
see
one
of
another
cast
?
<EOS>
the
lady
themselves
seem
so
sensible
of
this
,
that
they
be
all
industrious
to
procure
foil
:
nay
,
they
will
become
foil
to
themselves
;
for
I
have
observe
(
at
Bath
particularly
)
that
they
endeavour
to
appear
as
ugly
as
possible
in
the
morning
,
in
order
to
set
off
that
beauty
which
they
intend
to
show
you
in
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
Most
artist
have
this
secret
in
practice
,
though
some
,
perhaps
,
have
not
much
study
the
theory
.
<EOS>
the
jeweller
know
that
the
fine
brilliant
require
a
foil
;
and
the
painter
,
by
the
contrast
of
his
figure
,
often
acquire
great
applause
.
  
<EOS>
a
great
genius
among
us
will
illustrate
this
matter
fully
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
,
indeed
,
range
him
under
any
general
head
of
common
artist
,
as
he
hath
a
title
to
be
place
among
those
  
Inventas
qui
vitam
excoluere
per
arte
.
        
<EOS>
who
by
invent
art
have
life
improve
.
  
<EOS>
I
mean
here
the
inventor
of
that
most
exquisite
entertainment
,
call
the
English
Pantomime
.
  
<EOS>
this
entertainment
consist
of
two
part
,
which
the
inventor
distinguish
by
the
name
of
the
serious
and
the
comic
.
<EOS>
the
serious
exhibit
a
certain
number
of
heathen
god
and
hero
,
who
be
certainly
the
bad
and
dull
company
into
which
an
audience
be
ever
introduce
;
and
(
which
be
a
secret
know
to
few
)
be
actually
intend
so
to
be
,
in
order
to
contrast
the
comic
part
of
the
entertainment
,
and
to
display
the
trick
of
harlequin
to
the
well
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
,
perhaps
,
no
very
civil
use
of
such
personage
:
but
the
contrivance
be
,
nevertheless
,
ingenious
enough
,
and
have
its
effect
.
<EOS>
and
this
will
now
plainly
appear
,
if
,
instead
of
serious
and
comic
,
we
supply
the
word
dull
and
dull
;
for
the
comic
be
certainly
dull
than
anything
before
show
on
the
stage
,
and
could
be
set
off
only
by
that
superlative
degree
of
dulness
which
compose
the
serious
.
<EOS>
so
intolerably
serious
,
indeed
,
be
these
god
and
hero
,
that
harlequin
(
though
the
english
gentleman
of
that
name
be
not
at
all
relate
to
the
french
family
,
for
he
be
of
a
much
more
serious
disposition
)
<EOS>
be
always
welcome
on
the
stage
,
as
he
relieve
the
audience
from
bad
company
.
  
<EOS>
judicious
writer
have
always
practise
this
art
of
contrast
with
great
success
.

I
have
be
surprize
that
Horace
should
cavil
at
this
art
in
Homer
;
but
indeed
he
contradict
himself
in
the
very
next
line
:
  
<EOS>
indignor
quandoque
bonus
dormitat
Homerus
;
     
<EOS>
Verum
opere
in
longo
fas
est
obrepere
somnum

<EOS>
I
grieve
if
e'er
great
Homer
chance
to
sleep
,
     
yet
slumber
on
long
work
have
right
to
creep
.
  
<EOS>
for
we
be
not
here
to
understand
,
as
perhaps
some
have
,
that
an
author
actually
fall
asleep
while
he
be
write
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
that
reader
be
too
apt
to
be
so
overtaken
;
but
if
the
work
be
as
long
as
any
of
Oldmixon
,
the
author
himself
be
too
well
entertained
to
be
subject
to
the
least
drowsiness
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
as
Mr
Pope
observe
,
       
Sleepless
himself
to
give
his
reader
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
these
soporific
part
be
so
many
scene
of
serious
artfully
interwoven
,
in
order
to
contrast
and
set
off
the
rest
;
and
this
be
the
true
meaning
of
a
late
facetious
writer
,
who
tell
the
public
that
whenever
he
be
dull
they
may
be
assure
there
be
a
design
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
light
,
then
,
or
rather
in
this
darkness
,
I
would
have
the
reader
to
consider
these
initial
essay
.
<EOS>
and
after
this
warning
,
if
he
shall
be
of
opinion
that
he
can
find
enough
of
serious
in
other
part
of
this
history
,
he
may
pass
over
these
,
in
which
we
profess
to
be
laboriously
dull
,
and
begin
the
follow
book
at
the
second
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
Mr
Jones
receive
many
friendly
visit
during
his
confinement
;
with
some
fine
touch
of
the
passion
of
love
,
scarce
visible
to
the
naked
eye
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
Jones
have
many
visitor
during
his
confinement
,
though
some
,
perhaps
,
be
not
very
agreeable
to
him
.
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
see
him
almost
every
day
;
but
though
he
pity
Tom
's
suffering
,
and
greatly
approve
the
gallant
behaviour
which
have
occasion
them
;
yet
he
think
this
be
a
favourable
opportunity
to
bring
him
to
a
sober
sense
of
his
indiscreet
conduct
;
and
that
wholesome
advice
for
that
purpose
could
never
be
apply
at
a
more
proper
season
than
at
the
present
,
when
the
mind
be
soften
by
pain
and
sickness
,
and
alarm
by
danger
;
and
when
its
attention
be
unembarrassed
with
those
turbulent
passion
which
engage
us
in
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
at
all
season
,
therefore
,
when
the
good
man
be
alone
with
the
youth
,
especially
when
the
latter
be
totally
at
ease
,
he
take
occasion
to
remind
him
of
his
former
miscarriage
,
but
in
the
mild
and
tender
manner
,
and
only
in
order
to
introduce
the
caution
which
he
prescribe
for
his
future
behaviour
;
"
on
which
alone
,
"
he
assure
him
,
"
would
depend
his
own
felicity
,
and
the
kindness
which
he
may
yet
promise
himself
to
receive
at
the
hand
of
his
father
by
adoption
,
unless
he
should
hereafter
forfeit
his
good
opinion
:
for
as
to
what
have
past
,
"
he
say
,
"
it
should
be
all
forgive
and
forget
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
advise
him
to
make
a
good
use
of
this
accident
,
that
so
in
the
end
it
may
prove
a
visitation
for
his
own
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Thwackum
be
likewise
pretty
assiduous
in
his
visit
;
and
he
too
consider
a
sick
-
bed
to
be
a
convenient
scene
for
lecture
.
<EOS>
His
stile
,
however
,
be
more
severe
than
Mr
Allworthy
's
:
he
tell
his
pupil
,
"
that
he
ought
to
look
on
his
broken
limb
as
a
judgment
from
heaven
on
his
sin
.
<EOS>
that
it
would
become
him
to
be
daily
on
his
knee
,
pour
forth
thanksgiving
that
he
have
break
his
arm
only
,
and
not
his
neck
;
<EOS>
which
latter
,
"
he
say
,
"
be
very
probably
reserve
for
some
future
occasion
,
and
that
,
perhaps
,
not
very
remote
.
<EOS>
for
his
part
,
"
he
say
,
"
he
have
often
wonder
some
judgment
have
not
overtake
him
before
;
but
it
may
be
perceive
by
this
,
that
Divine
punishment
,
though
slow
,
be
always
sure
.
<EOS>
"
hence
likewise
he
advise
him
,
"
to
foresee
,
with
equal
certainty
,
the
great
evil
which
be
yet
behind
,
and
which
be
as
sure
as
this
of
overtake
him
in
his
state
of
reprobacy
.
<EOS>
these
be
,
"
say
he
,
"
to
be
avert
only
by
such
a
thorough
and
sincere
repentance
as
be
not
to
be
expect
or
hope
for
from
one
so
abandon
in
his
youth
,
and
whose
mind
,
I
be
afraid
,
be
totally
corrupt
.
<EOS>
It
be
my
duty
,
however
,
to
exhort
you
to
this
repentance
,
<EOS>
though
I
too
well
know
all
exhortation
will
be
vain
and
fruitless
.
<EOS>
but
liberavi
animam
meam
.
<EOS>
I
can
accuse
my
own
conscience
of
no
neglect
;
though
it
be
at
the
same
time
with
the
utmost
concern
<EOS>
I
see
you
travel
on
to
certain
misery
in
this
world
,
and
to
as
certain
damnation
in
the
next
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Square
talk
in
a
very
different
strain
;
he
say
,
"
such
accident
as
a
broken
bone
be
below
the
consideration
of
a
wise
man
.
<EOS>
that
it
be
abundantly
sufficient
to
reconcile
the
mind
to
any
of
these
mischance
,
to
reflect
that
they
be
liable
to
befal
the
wise
of
mankind
,
and
be
undoubtedly
for
the
good
of
the
whole
.
"
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
It
be
a
mere
abuse
of
word
to
call
those
thing
evil
,
in
which
there
be
no
moral
unfitness
:
that
pain
,
which
be
the
bad
consequence
of
such
accident
,
be
the
most
contemptible
thing
in
the
world
;
"
with
more
of
the
like
sentence
,
extract
out
of
the
second
book
of
Tully
's
Tusculan
question
,
and
from
the
great
Lord
Shaftesbury
.
<EOS>
in
pronounce
these
he
be
one
day
so
eager
,
that
he
unfortunately
bite
his
tongue
;
and
in
such
a
manner
,
that
it
not
only
put
an
end
to
his
discourse
,
but
create
much
emotion
in
him
,
and
cause
him
to
mutter
an
oath
or
two
:
<EOS>
but
what
be
bad
of
all
,
this
accident
give
Thwackum
,
who
be
present
,
and
who
hold
all
such
doctrine
to
be
heathenish
and
atheistical
,
an
opportunity
to
clap
a
judgment
on
his
back
.
<EOS>
now
this
be
do
with
so
malicious
a
sneer
,
that
it
totally
unhinge
(
if
I
may
so
say
)
<EOS>
the
temper
of
the
philosopher
,
which
the
bite
of
his
tongue
have
somewhat
ruffle
;
and
as
he
be
disabled
from
vent
his
wrath
at
his
lip
,
he
have
possibly
find
a
more
violent
method
of
revenge
himself
,
have
not
the
surgeon
,
who
be
then
luckily
in
the
room
,
contrary
to
his
own
interest
,
interpose
and
preserve
the
peace
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Blifil
visit
his
friend
Jones
but
seldom
,
and
never
alone
.
<EOS>
this
worthy
young
man
,
however
,
profess
much
regard
for
him
,
and
as
great
concern
at
his
misfortune
;
but
cautiously
avoid
any
intimacy
,
l
,
as
he
frequently
hint
,
it
may
contaminate
the
sobriety
of
his
own
character
:
for
which
purpose
he
have
constantly
in
his
mouth
that
proverb
in
which
Solomon
speak
against
evil
communication
.
<EOS>
not
that
he
be
so
bitter
as
Thwackum
;
for
he
always
express
some
hope
of
Tom
's
reformation
;
"
which
,
"
he
say
,
"
the
unparalleled
goodness
show
by
his
uncle
on
this
occasion

must
certainly
effect
in
one
not
absolutely
abandon
:
"
but
conclude
,
"
if
Mr
Jones
ever
offend
hereafter
,
I
shall
not
be
able
to
say
a
syllable
in
his
favour

"
  
<EOS>
as
to
Squire
Western
,
he
be
seldom
out
of
the
sick
-
room
,
unless
when
he
be
engage
either
in
the
field
or
over
his
bottle
.
<EOS>
nay
,
he
would
sometimes
retire
hither
to
take
his
beer
,
and
it
be
not
without
difficulty
that
he
be
prevent
from
force
Jones
to
take
his
beer
too
:
for
no
quack
ever
hold
his
nostrum
to
be
a
more
general
panacea
than
he
do
this
;
which
,
he
say
,
have
more
virtue
in
it
than
be
in
all
the
physic
in
an
apothecary
's
shop
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
however
,
by
much
entreaty
,
prevail
on
to
forbear
the
application
of
this
medicine
;
but
from
serenade
his
patient
every
hunting
morning
with
the
horn
under
his
window
,
it
be
impossible
to
withhold
him
;
nor
do
he
ever
lay
aside
that
hallow
,
with
which
he
enter
into
all
company
,
when
he
visit
Jones
,
without
any
regard
to
the
sick
person
's
be
at
that
time
either
awake
or
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
this
boisterous
behaviour
,
as
it
mean
no
harm
,
so
happily
it
effect
none
,
and
be
abundantly
compensate
to
Jones
,
as
soon
as
he
be
able
to
sit
up
,
by
the
company
of
Sophia
,
whom
the
squire
then
bring
to
visit
him
;
nor
be
it
,
indeed
,
long
before
Jones
be
able
to
attend
her
to
the
harpsichord
,
where
she
would
kindly
condescend
,
for
hour
together
,
to
charm
him
with
the
most
delicious
music
,
unless
when
the
squire
think
proper
to
interrupt
her
,
by
insist
on
Old
Sir
Simon
,
or
some
other
of
his
favourite
piece
.
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
nice
guard
which
Sophia
endeavour
to
set
on
her
behaviour
,
she
could
not
avoid
let
some
appearance
now
and
then
slip
forth
:
for
love
may
again
be
liken
to
a
disease
in
this
,
that
when
it
be
deny
a
vent
in
one
part

it
will
certainly
break
out
in
another

what
her
lip
,
therefore
,
conceal
,
her
eye
,
her
blush
,
and
many
little
involuntary
action
,
betray
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
,
when
Sophia
be
play
on
the
harpsichord
,
and
Jones
be
attend
,
the
squire
come
into
the
room
,
cry
,
"
there
,
Tom
,
I
have
have
a
battle
for
thee
below
-
stair
with
thick
parson
Thwackum

He
hath
be
a
tell
Allworthy

before
my

that
the
broken
bone
be
a
judgment
upon
thee

d####n

it

say
I
,
how
can
that
be
?
<EOS>
do
he
not
come
by
it
in
defence
of
a
young
woman
?
<EOS>
a
judgment
indeed
!
<EOS>
Pox
,
if
he
never
doth
anything
bad
,
he
will
go
to
heaven
sooner
than
all
the
parson
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
He
hath
more
reason
to
glory
in
it
than
to
be
ashamed
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
sir
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
I
have
no
reason
for
either
;
but
if
it
preserve
Miss
Western
,
I
shall
always
think
it
the
happy
accident
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
to
gu

say
the
squire
,
"
to
zet
Allworthy
against
thee
vor
it
!
<EOS>
D####n
un
,
if
the
parson
have
unt
his
petticuoat
on
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
lend
un
o
flick
;
for
I
love
<EOS>
thee
dearly
,
my
boy
,
and
d####n
me
<EOS>
if
there
be
anything
in
my
power
which
I
will
not
do
for
thee
.
<EOS>
Sha't
take
thy
choice
of
all
the
horse
in
my
stable
to
-
morrow
morning
,
except
only
the
Chevalier
and
Miss
Slouch
.
"
<EOS>
Jones
thank
him
,
but
decline
accept
the
offer
.
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
"
add
the
squire
,
"
sha't
ha
the
sorrel
mare
that
Sophy
ride
.
<EOS>
She
cost
me
fifty
guinea
,
and
come
six
year
old
this
grass
.
"
<EOS>
"
if
she
have
cost
me
a
thousand
,
"
cry
Jones
passionately
,
"
I
would
have
give
her
to
the
dog
.
"
<EOS>
"
Pooh
!
pooh
!
"
answer
western
;
"
what
!
<EOS>
because
she
break
thy
arm
?
<EOS>
shouldst
forget
and
forgive
.
<EOS>
I
think
hadst
be
more
a
man
than
to
bear
malice
against
a
dumb
creature
.
"
 
<EOS>
here
Sophia
interpose
,
and
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
,
by
desire
her
father
's
leave
to
play
to
him
;
a
request
which
he
never
refuse
.
  
<EOS>
the
countenance
of
Sophia
have
undergo
more
than
one
change
during
the
foregoing
speech
;
and
probably
she
impute
the
passionate
resentment
which
Jones
have
express
against
the
mare
,
to
a
different
motive
from
that
from
which
her
father
have
derive
it
.
<EOS>
Her
spirit
be
at
this
time
in
a
visible
flutter
;
and
she
play
so
intolerably
ill
,
that
have
not
western
soon
fall
asleep
,
he
must
have
remark
it
.
<EOS>
Jones
,
however
,
who
be
sufficiently
awake
,
and
be
not
without
an
ear
any
more
than
without
eye
,
make
some
observation
;
which
be
join
to
all
which
the
reader
may
remember
to
have
pass
formerly
,
give
him
pretty
strong
assurance
,
when
he
come
to
reflect
on
the
whole
,
that
all
be
not
well
in
the
tender
bosom
of
Sophia
;
an
opinion
which
many
young
gentleman
will
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
not
,
extremely
wonder
at
his
not
have
be
well
confirm
in
long
ago
.
<EOS>
to
confess
the
truth
,
he
have
rather
too
much
diffidence
in
himself
,
and
be
not
forward
enough
in
see
the
advance
of
a
young
lady
;
a
misfortune
which
can
be
cure
only
by
that
early
town
education
,
which
be
at
present
so
generally
in
fashion
.
  
<EOS>
when
these
thought
have
fully
take
possession
of
Jones
,
they
occasion
a
perturbation
in
his
mind
,
which
,
in
a
constitution
less
pure
and
firm
than
his
,
may
have
be
,
at
such
a
season
,
attend
with
very
dangerous
consequence
.
<EOS>
He
be
truly
sensible
of
the
great
worth
of
Sophia
.
<EOS>
He
extremely
like
her
person
,
no
less
admire
her
accomplishment
,
and
tenderly
love
her
goodness
.
<EOS>
in
reality
,
as
he
have
never
once
entertain
any
thought
of
possess
her
,
nor
have
ever
give
the
least
voluntary
indulgence
to
his
inclination
,
he
have
a
much
strong
passion
for
her
than
he
himself
be
acquaint
with
.
<EOS>
His
heart
now
bring
forth
the
full
secret
,
at
the
same
time
that
it
assure
him
the
adorable
object
return
his
affection
.
    
<EOS>
which
all
who
have
no
heart
will
think
to
contain
much
ado
about
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
the
reader
will
perhaps
imagine
the
sensation
which
now
arise
in
Jones
to
have
be
so
sweet
and
delicious
,
that
they
would
rather
tend
to
produce
a
chearful
serenity
in
the
mind
,
than
any
of
those
dangerous
effect
which
we
have
mention
;
but
in
fact
,
sensation
of
this
kind
,
however
delicious
,
be
,
at
their
first
recognition
,
of
a
very
tumultuous
nature
,
and
have
very
little
of
the
opiate
in
them
.
<EOS>
They
be
,
moreover
,
in
the
present
case
,
embitter
with
certain
circumstance
,
which
be
mix
with
sweet
ingredient
,
tend
altogether
to
compose
a
draught
that
may
be
term
bitter
-
sweet
;
than
which
,
as
nothing
can
be
more
disagreeable
to
the
palate
,
so
nothing
,
in
the
metaphorical
sense
,
can
be
so
injurious
to
the
mind
.
  
<EOS>
for
first
,
though
he
have
sufficient
foundation
to
flatter
himself
in
what
he
have
observe
in
Sophia
,
he
be
not
yet
free
from
doubt
of
misconstrue
compassion
,
or
at
good
,
esteem
,
into
a
warm
regard
.
<EOS>
He
be
far
from
a
sanguine
assurance
that
Sophia
have
any
such
affection
towards
him
,
as
may
promise
his
inclination
that
harvest
,
which
,
if
they
be
encourage
and
nurse
,
they
would
finally
grow
up
to
require
.
<EOS>
besides
,
if
he
could
hope
to
find
no
bar
to
his
happiness
from
the
daughter
,
he
think
himself
certain
of
meet
an
effectual
bar
in
the
father
;
who
,
though
he
be
a
country
squire
in
his
diversion
,
be
perfectly
a
man
of
the
world
in
whatever
regard
his
fortune
;
have
the
most
violent
affection
for
his
only
daughter
,
and
have
often
signify
,
in
his
cup
,
the
pleasure
he
propose
in
see
her
marry
to
one
of
the
rich
man
in
the
county
.
<EOS>
Jones
be
not
so
vain
and
senseless
a
coxcomb
as
to
expect
,
from
any
regard
which
Western
have
profess
for
him
,
that
he
would
ever
be
induce
to
lay
aside
these
view
of
advance
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
He
well
know
that
fortune
be
generally
the
principal
,
if
not
the
sole
,
consideration
,
which
operate
on
the
good
of
parent
in
these
matter
:
for
friendship
make
us
warmly
espouse
the
interest
of
other
;
but
it
be
very
cold
to
the
gratification
of
their
passion
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
to
feel
the
happiness
which
may
result
from
this
,
it
be
necessary
we
should
possess
the
passion
ourselves
.
<EOS>
as
he
have
therefore
no
hope
of
obtain
her
father
's
consent
;
so
he
think
to
endeavour
to
succeed
without
it
,
and
by
such
mean
to
frustrate
the
great
point
of
Mr
Western
's
life
,
be
to
make
a
very
ill
use
of
his
hospitality
,
and
a
very
ungrateful
return
to
the
many
little
favour
receive
(
however
roughly
)
at
his
hand
.
<EOS>
if
he
see
such
a
consequence
with
horror
and
disdain
,
how
much
more
be
he
shock
with
what
regard
Mr
Allworthy
;
to
whom
,
as
he
have
more
than
filial
obligation
,
so
have
he
for
him
more
than
filial
piety
!
<EOS>
He
know
the
nature
of
that
good
man
to
be
so
averse
to
any
baseness
or
treachery
,
that
the
least
attempt
of
such
a
kind
would
make
the
sight
of
the
guilty
person
for
ever
odious
to
his
eye
,
and
his
name
a
detestable
sound
in
his
ear
.
<EOS>
the
appearance
of
such
unsurmountable
difficulty
be
sufficient
to
have
inspire
him
with
despair
,
however
ardent
his
wish
have
be
;
but
even
these
be
contruole
by
compassion
for
another
woman
.
<EOS>
the
idea
of
lovely
Molly
now
intrude
itself
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
swear
eternal
constancy
in
her
arm
,
and
she
have
as
often
vow
never
to
out
-
live
his
desert
her
.
<EOS>
He
now
see
her
in
all
the
most
shocking
posture
of
death
;
nay
,
he
consider
all
the
misery
of
prostitution
to
which
she
would
be
liable
,
and
of
which
he
would
be
doubly
the
occasion
;
first
by
seduce
,
and
then
by
desert
her
;
for
he
well
know
the
hatred
which
all
her
neighbour
,
and
even
her
own
sister
,
bore
her
,
and
how
ready
they
would
all
be
to
tear
her
to
piece
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
have
expose
her
to
more
envy
than
shame
,
or
rather
to
the
latter
by
mean
of
the
former
:
for
many
woman
abuse
her
for
be
a
whore
,
while
they
envy
her
her
lover
,
and
her
finery
,
and
would
have
be
themselves
glad
to
have
purchase
these
at
the
same
rate
.
<EOS>
the
ruin
,
therefore
,
of
the
poor
girl
must
,
he
foresaw
,
unavoidably
attend
his
desert
her
;
and
this
thought
sting
him
to
the
soul
.
<EOS>
poverty
and
distress
seem
to
him
to
give
none
a
right
of
aggravate
those
misfortune
.
<EOS>
the
meanness
of
her
condition
do
not
represent
her
misery
as
of
little
consequence
in
his
eye
,
nor
do
it
appear
to
justify
,
or
even
to
palliate
,
his
guilt
,
in
bring
that
misery
upon
her
.
<EOS>
but
why
do
I
mention
justification
?
<EOS>
His
own
heart
would
not
suffer
him
to
destroy
a
human
creature
who
,
he
think
,
love
him
,
and
have
to
that
love
sacrifice
her
innocence
.
<EOS>
His
own
good
heart
plead
her
cause
;
not
as
a
cold
venal
advocate
,
but
as
one
interested
in
the
event
,
and
which
must
itself
deeply
share
in
all
the
agony
its
owner
bring
on
another
.
  
<EOS>
when
this
powerful
advocate
have
sufficiently
raise
the
pity
of
Jones
,
by
paint
poor
Molly
in
all
the
circumstance
of
wretchedness
;
it
artfully
call
in
the
assistance
of
another
passion
,
and
represent
the
girl
in
all
the
amiable
colour
of
youth
,
health
,
and
beauty
;
as
one
greatly
the
object
of
desire
,
and
much
more
so
,
at
least
to
a
good
mind
,
from
be
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
object
of
compassion
.
  
<EOS>
amidst
these
thought
,
poor
Jones
pass
a
long
sleepless
night
,
and
in
the
morning
the
result
of
the
whole
be
to
abide
by
Molly
,
and
to
think
no
more
of
Sophia
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
virtuous
resolution
he
continue
all
the
next
day
till
the
evening
,
cherish
the
idea
of
Molly
,
and
drive
Sophia
from
his
thought
;
but
in
the
fatal
evening
,
a
very
trifling
accident
set
all
his
passion
again
on
float
,
and
work
so
total
a
change
in
his
mind
,
that
we
think
it
decent
to
communicate
it
in
a
fresh
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
a
little
chapter
,
in
which
be
contain
a
little
incident
.
 
<EOS>
among
other
visitant
,
who
pay
their
compliment
to
the
young
gentleman
in
his
confinement
,
Mrs
Honour
be
one
.
<EOS>
the
reader
,
perhaps
,
when
he
reflect
on
some
expression
which
have
formerly
dropt
from
her
,
may
conceive
that
she
herself
have
a
very
particular
affection
for
Mr
Jones
;
but
,
in
reality
,
it
be
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
Tom
be
a
handsome
young
fellow
;
and
for
that
specie
of
man
<EOS>
Mrs
Honour
have
some
regard
;
but
this
be
perfectly
indiscriminate
;
for
have
be
cross
in
the
love
which
she
bear
a
certain
nobleman
's
footman
,
who
have
basely
desert
her
after
a
promise
of
marriage
,
she
have
so
securely
keep
together
the
broken
remain
of
her
heart
,
that
no
man
have
ever
since
be
able
to
possess
himself
of
any
single
fragment
.
<EOS>
She
view
all
handsome
man
with
that
equal
regard
and
benevolence
which
a
sober
and
virtuous
mind
bear
to
all
the
good
.
<EOS>
She
may
indeed
be
call
a
lover
of
man
,
as
Socrates
be
a
lover
of
mankind
,
prefer
one
to
another
for
corporeal
,
as
he
for
mental
qualification
;
but
never
carry
this
preference
so
far
as
to
cause
any
perturbation
in
the
philosophical
serenity
of
her
temper
.
  
<EOS>
the
day
after
Mr
Jones
have
that
conflict
with
himself
which
we
have
see
in
the
precede
chapter
,
Mrs
Honour
come
into
his
room
,
and
find
him
alone
,
begin
in
the
follow
manner
:
 
"
La
,
sir
,
where
do
you
think
I
have
be
?
<EOS>
I
warrant
you
,
you
would
not
guess
in
fifty
year
;
but
if
you
do
guess
,
to
be
sure
I
must
not
tell
you
neither
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
if
it
be
something
which
you
must
not
tell
me
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
I
shall
have
the
curiosity
to
enquire
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
not
be
so
barbarous
to
refuse
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
cry
she
,
"
why
I
should
refuse
you
neither
,
for
that
matter
;
for
to
be
sure
you
will
not
mention
it
any
more
.
<EOS>
and
for
that
matter
,
if
you
know
where
I
have
be
,
unless
you
know
what
I
have
be
about
,
it
would
not
signify
much
.
<EOS>
nay
,
I
do
not
see
why
it
should
be
keep
a
secret
for
my
part
;
for
to
be
sure
she
be
the
good
lady
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
upon
this
,
Jones
begin
to
beg
earnestly
to
be
let
into
this
secret
,
and
faithfully
promise
not
to
divulge
it
.
<EOS>
She
then
proceed
thus
:
 
"
why
,
you
must
know
,
sir
,
my
young
lady
send
me
to
enquire
after
Molly
Seagrim
,
and
to
see
whether
the
wench
want
anything
;
to
be
sure
,
I
do
not
care
to
go
,
methink
;
but
servant
must
do
what
they
be
order
.
 
<EOS>
how
could
you
undervalue
yourself
so
,
Mr
Jones
?
 
<EOS>
so
my
lady
bid
me
go
and
carry
her
some
linen
,
and
other
thing
.
<EOS>
She
be
too
good
.
<EOS>
if
such
forward
slut
be
send
to
Bridewell
,
it
would
be
well
for
them
.
<EOS>
I
tell
my
lady
,
say
I
,
madam
,
your
la'ship
be
encourage
idleness
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
be
my
Sophia
so
good
?
"
say
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
Sophia
!
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
marry
come
up
,
"
answer
honour
.
"
<EOS>
and
yet
if
you
know
all
 
indeed
,
if
I
be
as
Mr
Jones
,
I
should
look
a
little
high
than
such
trumpery
as
Molly
Seagrim
.
"
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
by
these
word
,
"
reply
Jones
,
"
if
I
know
all
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
mean
what
I
mean
,
"
say
Honour
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
remember
put
your
hand
in
my
lady
's
muff
once
?
<EOS>
I
vow
<EOS>
I
could
almost
find
in
my
heart
to
tell
,
if
I
be
certain
<EOS>
my
lady
would
never
come
to
the
hearing
on't
.
"
<EOS>
Jones
then
make
several
solemn
protestation
.
<EOS>
and
Honour
proceed
 
<EOS>
"
then
to
be
sure
,
my
lady
give
me
that
muff
;
and
afterwards
,
upon
hear
what
you
have
do
<EOS>
"
 
"
then
you
tell
her
what
I
have
do
?
"
interrupt
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
do
,
sir
,
"
answer
she
,
"
you
need
not
be
angry
with
me
.
<EOS>
many
be
the
man
would
have
give
his
head
to
have
have
my
lady
tell
,
if
they
have
know
,
 
for
,
to
be
sure
,
the
big
lord
in
the
land
may
be
proud
 
<EOS>
but
,
I
protest
,
I
have
a
great
mind
not
to
tell
you
.
"
<EOS>
Jones
fall
to
entreaty
,
and
soon
prevail
on
her
to
go
on
thus
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
then
,
sir
,
that
my
lady
have
give
this
muff
to
me
;
but
about
a
day
or
two
after
I
have
tell
her
the
story
,
she
quarrel
with
her
new
muff
,
and
to
be
sure
it
be
the
prettiest
that
ever
be
see
.
<EOS>
honour
,
say
she
,
this
be
an
odious
muff
;
it
be
too
big
for
me
,
<EOS>
I
can
not
wear
it
:
till
I
can
get
another
,
you
must
let
me
have
my
old
one
again
,
and
you
may
have
this
in
the
room
<EOS>
on't
 
<EOS>
for
she
be
a
good
lady
,
and
scorn
to
give
a
thing
and
take
a
thing
,
I
promise
you
that
.
<EOS>
so
to
be
sure
I
fetch
it
her
back
again
,
and
,
I
believe
,
she
hath
wear
it
upon
her
arm
almost
ever
since
,
and
I
warrant
hath
<EOS>
give
it
many
a
kiss
when
nobody
hath
see
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
the
conversation
be
interrupt
by
Mr
Western
himself
,
who
come
to
summon
Jones
to
the
harpsichord
;
whither
the
poor
young
fellow
go
all
pale
and
trembling
.
<EOS>
this
Western
observe
,
but
,
on
see
Mrs
Honour
,
impute
it
to
a
wrong
cause
;
and
have
give
Jones
a
hearty
curse
between
jest
and
earnest
,
he
bid
him
beat
abroad
,
and
not
poach
up
the
game
in
his
warren
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
look
this
evening
with
more
than
usual
beauty
,
and
we
may
believe
it
be
no
small
addition
to
her
charm
,
in
the
eye
of
Mr
Jones
,
that
she
now
happen
to
have
on
her
right
arm
this
very
muff
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
play
one
of
her
father
's
favourite
tune
,
and
he
be
lean
on
her
chair
,
when
the
muff
fall
over
her
finger
,
and
put
her
out
.
<EOS>
this
so
disconcert
the
squire
,
that
he
snatch
the
muff
from
her
,
and
with
a
hearty
curse
throw
it
into
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Sophia
instantly
start
up
,
and
with
the
utmost
eagerness
recover
it
from
the
flame
.
  
<EOS>
though
this
incident
will
probably
appear
of
little
consequence
to
many
of
our
reader
;
yet
,
trifle
as
it
be
,
it
have
so
violent
an
effect
on
poor
Jones
,
that
we
think
it
our
duty
to
relate
it
.
<EOS>
in
reality
,
there
be
many
little
circumstance
too
often
omit
by
injudicious
historian
,
from
which
event
of
the
utmost
importance
arise
.
<EOS>
the
world
may
indeed
be
consider
as
a
vast
machine
,
in
which
the
great
wheel
be
originally
set
in
motion
by
those
which
be
very
minute
,
and
almost
imperceptible
to
any
but
the
strong
eye
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
not
all
the
charm
of
the
incomparable
Sophia
;
not
all
the
dazzling
brightness
,
and
languish
softness
of
her
eye
;
the
harmony
of
her
voice
,
and
of
her
person
;
not
all
her
wit
,
good
-
humour
,
greatness
of
mind
,
or
sweetness
of
disposition
,
have
be
able
so
absolutely
to
conquer
and
enslave
the
heart
of
poor
Jones
,
as
this
little
incident
of
the
muff
.
<EOS>
thus
the
poet
sweetly
sing
of
Troy
     
Captique
dolis
lachrymisque
coacti
      
Quos
neque
Tydides

which
our

have
lately
with
so
much
military
wisdom
place
as
guard

run

<EOS>
a
very
long
chapter
,
contain
a
very
great
incident
.
 
<EOS>
but
though
this
victorious
deity
easily
expel
his
avow
enemy
from
the
heart
of
Jones
,
he
find
it
more
difficult
to
supplant
the
garrison
which
he
himself
have
place
there
.
<EOS>
to
lay
aside
all
allegory
,
the
concern
for
what
must
become
of
poor
Molly
greatly
disturb
and
perplex
the
mind
of
the
worthy
youth
.
<EOS>
the
superior
merit
of
Sophia
totally
eclipse
,
or
rather
extinguish
,
all
the
beauty
of
the
poor
girl
;
but
compassion
instead
of
contempt
succeed
to
love
.
<EOS>
He
be
convince
the
girl
have
place
all
her
affection
,
and
all
her
prospect
of
future
happiness
,
in
him
only
.
<EOS>
for
this
he
have
,
he
know
,
give
sufficient
occasion
,
by
the
utmost
profusion
of
tenderness
towards
her
:
a
tenderness
which
he
have
take
every
means
to
persuade
her
he
would
always
maintain
.
<EOS>
She
,
on
her
side
,
have
assure
him
of
her
firm
belief
in
his
promise
,
and
have
with
the
most
solemn
vow
declare
,
that
on
his
fulfilling
or
break
these
promise
,
it
depend
,
whether
she
should
be
the
happy
or
most
miserable
of
womankind
.
<EOS>
and
to
be
the
author
of
this
high
degree
of
misery
to
a
human
being
,
be
a
thought
on
which
he
could
not
bear
to
ruminate
a
single
moment
.
<EOS>
He
consider
this
poor
girl
as
have
sacrifice
to
him
everything
in
her
little
power
;
as
have
be
at
her
own
expense
the
object
of
his
pleasure
;
as
sigh
and
languish
for
him
even
at
that
very
instant
.
<EOS>
Shall
then
,
say
he
,
my
recovery
,
<EOS>
for
which
she
hath
so
ardently
wish
;
shall
my
presence
,
which
she
hath
so
eagerly
expect
,
instead
of
give
her
that
joy
with
which
she
hath
flatter
herself
,
cast
her
at
once
down
into
misery
and
despair
?
<EOS>
Can
I
be
such
a
villain
?
<EOS>
here
,
when
the
genius
of
poor
Molly
seem
triumphant
,
the
love
of
Sophia
towards
him
,
which
now
appear
no
longer
dubious
,
rush
upon
his
mind
,
and
bear
away
every
obstacle
before
it
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
it
occur
to
him
,
that
he
may
possibly
be
able
to
make
Molly
amend
another
way
;
namely
,
by
give
her
a
sum
of
money
.
<EOS>
this
,
nevertheless
,
he
almost
despair
of
her
accepting
,
when
he
recollect
the
frequent
and
vehement
assurance
he
have
receive
from
her
,
that
the
world
put
in
balance
with
him
would
make
her
no
amend
for
his
loss
.
<EOS>
however
,
her
extreme
poverty
,
and
chiefly
her
egregious
vanity
(
somewhat
of
which
hath
be
already
hint
to
the
reader
)
,
give
him
some
little
hope
,
that
,
notwithstanding
all
her
avow
tenderness
,
she
may
in
time
be
bring
to
content
herself
with
a
fortune
superior
to
her
expectation
,
and
which
may
indulge
her
vanity
,
by
set
her
above
all
her
equal
.
<EOS>
He
resolve
therefore
to
take
the
first
opportunity
of
make
a
proposal
of
this
kind
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
,
accordingly
,
when
his
arm
be
so
well
recover
that
he
could
walk
easily
with
it
sling
in
a
sash
,
he
steal
forth
,
at
a
season
when
the
squire
be
engage
in
his
field
exercise
,
and
visit
his
fair
one
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
and
sister
,
whom
he
find
take
their
tea
,
inform
him
first
that
Molly
be
not
at
home
;
but
afterwards
the
eld
sister
acquaint
him
,
with
a
malicious
smile
,
that
she
be
above
stair
a
-
bed
.
<EOS>
Tom
have
no
objection
to
this
situation
of
his
mistress
,
and
immediately
ascend
the
ladder
which
lead
towards
her
bed
-
chamber
;
but
when
he
come
to
the
top
,
he
,
to
his
great
surprize
,
find
the
door
fast
;
nor
could
he
for
some
time
obtain
any
answer
from
within
;
for
Molly
,
as
she
herself
afterwards
inform
him
,
be
fast
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
the
extreme
of
grief
and
joy
have
be
remark
to
produce
very
similar
effect
;
and
when
either
of
these
rush
on
us
by
surprize
,
it
be
apt
to
create
such
a
total
perturbation
and
confusion
,
that
we
be
often
thereby
deprive
of
the
use
of
all
our
faculty
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
therefore
be
wonder
at
,
that
the
unexpected
sight
of
Mr
Jones
should
so
strongly
operate
on
the
mind
of
Molly
,
and
should
overwhelm
her
with
such
confusion
,
that
for
some
minute
she
be
unable
to
express
the
great
rapture
,
with
which
the
reader
will
suppose
she
be
affect
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
as
for
Jones
,
he
be
so
entirely
possess
,
and
as
it
be
enchant
,
by
the
presence
of
his
beloved
object
,
that
he
for
a
while
forget
Sophia
,
and
consequently
the
principal
purpose
of
his
visit
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
soon
recur
to
his
memory
;
and
after
the
first
transport
of
their
meeting
be
over
,
he
find
mean
by
degree
to
introduce
a
discourse
on
the
fatal
consequence
which
must
attend
their
amour
,
if
Mr
Allworthy
,
who
have
strictly
forbid
him
ever
see
her
more
,
should
discover
that
he
still
carry
on
this
commerce
.
<EOS>
such
a
discovery
,
which
his
enemy
give
him
reason
to
think
would
be
unavoidable
,
must
,
he
say
,
end
in
his
ruin
,
and
consequently
in
hers
.
<EOS>
since
therefore
their
hard
fate
have
determine
that
they
must
separate
,
he
advise
her
to
bear
it
with
resolution
,
and
swear
he
would
never
omit
any
opportunity
,
through
the
course
of
his
life
,
of
show
her
the
sincerity
of
his
affection
,
by
provide
for
her
in
a
manner
beyond
her
utmost
expectation
,
or
even
beyond
her
wish
,
if
ever
that
should
be
in
his
power
;
conclude
at
last
,
that
she
may
soon
find
some
man
who
would
marry
her
,
and
who
would
make
her
much
happy
than
she
could
be
by
lead
a
disreputable
life
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
Molly
remain
a
few
moment
in
silence
,
and
then
burst
into
a
flood
of
tear
,
she
begin
to
upbraid
him
in
the
follow
word
:
"
<EOS>
and
this
be
your
love
for
me
,
to
forsake
me
in
this
manner
,
now
you
have
ruin
me
!
<EOS>
how
often
,
when
I
have
tell
you
that
all
man
be
false
and
perjury
alike
,
and
grow
tired
of
us
as
soon
as
ever
they
have
have
their
wicked
will
of
us
,
how
often
have
you
swear
you
would
never
forsake
me
!
<EOS>
and
can
you
be
such
a
perjury
man
after
all
?
<EOS>
what
signify
all
the
rich
in
the
world
to
me
without
you
,
now
you
have
gain
my
heart
,
<EOS>
so
you
have
 
<EOS>
you
have
?
<EOS>
why
do
you
mention
another
man
to
me
?
<EOS>
I
can
never
love
any
other
man
as
long
as
I
live
.
<EOS>
all
other
man
be
nothing
to
me
.
<EOS>
if
the
great
squire
in
all
the
country
would
come
a
suiting
to
me
to
-
morrow
,
I
would
not
give
my
company
to
him
.
<EOS>
no
,
I
shall
always
hate
and
despise
the
whole
sex
for
your
sake
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
She
be
proceed
thus
,
when
an
accident
put
a
stop
to
her
tongue
,
before
it
have
run
out
half
its
career
.
<EOS>
the
room
,
or
rather
garret
,
in
which
Molly
lie
,
be
up
one
pair
of
stair
,
that
be
to
say
,
at
the
top
of
the
house
,
be
of
a
sloping
figure
,
resemble
the
great
Delta
of
the
Greeks
.
<EOS>
the
english
reader
may
perhaps
form
a
well
idea
of
it
,
by
be
tell
that
it
be
impossible
to
stand
upright
anywhere
but
in
the
middle
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
this
room
want
the
conveniency
of
a
closet
,
Molly
have
,
to
supply
that
defect
,
nail
up
an
old
rug
against
the
rafter
of
the
house
,
which
enclose
a
little
hole
where
her
good
apparel
,
such
as
the
remain
of
that
sack
which
we
have
formerly
mention
,
some
cap
,
and
other
thing
with
which
she
have
lately
provide
herself
,
be
hang
up
and
secure
from
the
dust
.
  
<EOS>
this
enclose
place
exactly
front
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
to
which
,
indeed
,
the
rug
hang
so
near
,
that
it
serve
in
a
manner
to
supply
the
want
of
curtain
.
<EOS>
now
,
whether
Molly
,
in
the
agony
of
her
rage
,
push
this
rug
with
her
foot
;
or
Jones
may
touch
it
;
or
whether
the
pin
or
nail
give
way
of
its
own
accord
,
I
be
not
certain
;
but
as
Molly
pronounce
those
last
word
,
which
be
record
above
,
the
wicked
rug
get
loose
from
its
fastening
,
and
discover
everything
hide
behind
it
;
where
among
other
female
utensil
appear
(
with
shame
I
write
it
,
and
with
sorrow
will
it
be
read
)
 
the
philosopher
Square
,
in
a
posture
(
for
the
place
would
not
near
admit
his
stand
upright
)
<EOS>
as
ridiculous
as
can
possibly
be
conceive
.
  
<EOS>
the
posture
,
indeed
,
in
which
he
stand
,
be
not
greatly
unlike
that
of
a
soldier
who
be
tie
neck
and
heel
;
or
rather
resemble
the
attitude
in
which
we
often
see
fellow
in
the
public
street
of
London
,
who
be
not
suffer
but
deserve
punishment
by
so
stand
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
nightcap
belong
to
Molly
on
his
head
,
and
his
two
large
eye
,
the
moment
the
rug
fall
,
stare
directly
at
Jones
;
so
that
when
the
idea
of
philosophy
be
add
to
the
figure
now
discover
,
it
would
have
be
very
difficult
for
any
spectator
to
have
refrain
from
immoderate
laughter
.
  
<EOS>
I
question
not
but
the
surprize
of
the
reader
will
be
here
equal
to
that
of
Jones
;
as
the
suspicion
which
must
arise
from
the
appearance
of
this
wise
and
grave
man
in
such
a
place
,
may
seem
so
inconsistent
with
that
character
which
he
hath
,
doubtless
,
maintain
hitherto
,
in
the
opinion
of
every
one
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
confess
the
truth
,
this
inconsistency
be
rather
imaginary
than
real
.
<EOS>
philosopher
be
compose
of
flesh
and
blood
as
well
as
other
human
creature
;
and
however
sublimate
and
refine
the
theory
of
these
may
be
,
a
little
practical
frailty
be
as
incident
to
them
as
to
other
mortal
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
indeed
,
in
theory
only
,
and
not
in
practice
,
as
we
have
before
hint
,
that
consist
the
difference
:
for
though
such
great
being
think
much
well
and
more
wisely
,
they
always
act
exactly
like
other
man
.
<EOS>
They
know
very
well
how
to
subdue
all
appetite
and
passion
,
and
to
despise
both
pain
and
pleasure
;
and
this
knowledge
afford
much
delightful
contemplation
,
and
be
easily
acquire
;
but
the
practice
would
be
vexatious
and
troublesome
;
and
,
therefore
,
the
same
wisdom
which
teach
them
to
know
this
,
teach
them
to
avoid
carry
it
into
execution
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Square
happen
to
be
at
church
on
that
Sunday
,
when
,
as
the
reader
may
be
pleased
to
remember
,
the
appearance
of
Molly
in
her
sack
have
cause
all
that
disturbance
.
<EOS>
here
he
first
observe
her
,
and
be
so
pleased
with
her
beauty
,
that
he
prevail
with
the
young
gentleman
to
change
their
intend
ride
that
evening
,
that
he
may
pass
by
the
habitation
of
Molly
,
and
by
that
mean
may
obtain
a
second
chance
of
see
her
.
<EOS>
this
reason
,
however
,
as
he
do
not
at
that
time
mention
to
any
,
so
neither
do
we
think
proper
to
communicate
it
then
to
the
reader
.
  
<EOS>
among
other
particular
which
constitute
the
unfitness
of
thing
in
Mr
Square
's
opinion
,
danger
and
difficulty
be
two
.
<EOS>
the
difficulty
therefore
which
he
apprehend
there
may
be
in
corrupt
this
young
wench
,
and
the
danger
which
would
accrue
to
his
character
on
the
discovery
,
be
such
strong
dissuasive
,
that
it
be
probable
<EOS>
he
at
first
intend
to
have
content
himself
with
the
pleasing
idea
which
the
sight
of
beauty
furnish
us
with
.
<EOS>
these
the
grave
man
,
after
a
full
meal
of
serious
meditation
,
often
allow
themselves
by
way
of
dessert
:
for
which
purpose
,
certain
book
and
picture
find
their
way
into
the
most
private
recess
of
their
study
,
and
a
certain
liquorish
part
of
natural
philosophy
be
often
the
principal
subject
of
their
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
the
philosopher
hear
,
a
day
or
two
afterwards
,
that
the
fortress
of
virtue
have
already
be
subdue
,
he
begin
to
give
a
large
scope
to
his
desire
.
<EOS>
His
appetite
be
not
of
that
squeamish
kind
which
can
not
feed
on
a
dainty
because
another
hath
taste
it
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
like
the
girl
the
well
for
the
want
of
that
chastity
,
which
,
if
she
have
possess
it
,
must
have
be
a
bar
to
his
pleasure
;
he
pursue
and
obtain
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
will
be
mistake
,
if
he
think
Molly
give
Square
the
preference
to
her
young
lover
:
on
the
contrary
,
have
she
be
confine
to
the
choice
of
one
only
,
Tom
Jones
would
undoubtedly
have
be
,
of
the
two
,
the
victorious
person
.
<EOS>
nor
be
it
solely
the
consideration
that
two
be
well
than
one
(
though
this
have
its
proper
weight
)
to
which
Mr
Square
owe
his
success
:
the
absence
of
Jones
during
his
confinement
be
an
unlucky
circumstance
;
and
in
that
interval
some
well
-
choose
present
from
the
philosopher
so
softened
and
unguarde
the
girl
's
heart
,
that
a
favourable
opportunity
become
irresistible
,
and
Square
triumph
over
the
poor
remain
of
virtue
which
subsist
in
the
bosom
of
Molly
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
about
a
fortnight
since
this
conquest
,
when
Jones
pay
the
above
-
mention
visit
to
his
mistress
,
at
a
time
when
she
and
Square
be
in
bed
together
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
true
reason
why
the
mother
deny
her
as
we
have
see
;
for
as
the
old
woman
share
in
the
profit
arise
from
the
iniquity
of
her
daughter
,
she
encourage
and
protect
her
in
it
to
the
utmost
of
her
power
;
but
such
be
the
envy
and
hatred
which
the
eld
sister
bear
towards
Molly
,
that
,
notwithstanding
she
have
some
part
of
the
booty
,
she
would
willingly
have
part
with
this
to
ruin
her
sister
and
spoil
her
trade
.
<EOS>
hence
she
have
acquaint
Jones
with
her
be
above
-
stair
in
bed
,
in
hope
that
he
may
have
catch
her
in
Square
's
arm
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
Molly
find
mean
to
prevent
,
as
the
door
be
fasten
;
which
give
her
an
opportunity
of
convey
her
lover
behind
that
rug
or
blanket

he
now
be
unhappily

<EOS>
Square
no
sooner
make
his
appearance
than
Molly
fling
herself
back
in
her
bed
,
cry
out
she
be
undone
,
and
abandon
herself
to
despair
.
<EOS>
this
poor
girl
,
who
be
yet
but
a
novice
in
her
business
,
have
not
arrive
to
that
perfection
of
assurance
which
help
off
a
town
lady
in
any
extremity
;
and
either
prompt
her
with
an
excuse
,
or
else
inspire
her
to
brazen
out
the
matter
with
her
husband
,
who
,
from
love
of
quiet
,
or
out
of
fear
of
his
reputation
 
and
sometimes
,
perhaps
,
from
fear
of
the
gallant
,
who
,
like
Mr
Constant
in
the
play
,
wear
a
sword
 
be
glad
to
shut
his
eye
,
and
content
to
put
his
horn
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
molly
,
on
the
contrary
,
be
silence
by
this
evidence
,
and
very
fairly
give
up
a
cause
which
she
have
hitherto
maintain
with
so
many
tear
,
and
with
such
solemn
and
vehement
protestation
of
the
pure
love
and
constancy
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
gentleman
behind
the
arra
,
he
be
not
in
much
less
consternation
.
<EOS>
He
stand
for
a
while
motionless
,
and
seem
equally
at
a
loss
what
to
say
,
or
whither
to
direct
his
eye
.
<EOS>
Jones
,
though
perhaps
the
most
astonished
of
the
three
,
first
find
his
tongue
;
and
be
immediately
recover
from
those
uneasy
sensation
which
Molly
by
her
upbraiding
have
occasion
,
he
burst
into
a
loud
laughter
,
and
then
salute
Mr
Square
,
advanced
to
take
him
by
the
hand
,
and
to
relieve
him
from
his
place
of
confinement
.
  
<EOS>
Square
be
now
arrive
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
in
which
part
only
he
could
stand
upright
,
look
at
Jones
with
a
very
grave
countenance
,
and
say
to
him
,
"
well
,
sir
,
I
see
you
enjoy
this
mighty
discovery
,
and
,
I
dare
swear
,
take
great
delight
in
the
thought
of
expose
me
;
but
if
you
will
consider
the
matter
fairly
,
you
will
find
you
be
yourself
only
to
blame
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
guilty
of
corrupting
innocence
.
<EOS>
I
have
do
nothing
for
which
that
part
of
the
world
which
judge
of
matter
by
the
rule
of
right
,
will
condemn
me
.
<EOS>
fitness
be
govern
by
the
nature
of
thing
,
and
not
by
custom
,
form
,
or
municipal
law
.
<EOS>
nothing
be
indeed
unfit
which
be
not
unnatural
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
reason
,
old
boy
,
"
answer
Jones
;
"
but
why
dost
thou
think
that
I
should
desire
to
expose
thee
?
<EOS>
I
promise
thee
,
<EOS>
I
be
never
better
pleased
with
thee
in
my
life
;
and
unless
thou
hast
a
mind
to
discover
it
thyself
,
this
affair
may
remain
a
profound
secret
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Mr
Jones
,
"
reply
Square
,
"
I
would
not
be
think
to
undervalue
reputation
.
<EOS>
good
fame
be
a
species
of
the
Kalon
,
and
it
be
by
no
mean
fit
to
neglect
it
.
<EOS>
besides
,
to
murder
one
's
own
reputation
be
a
kind
of
suicide
,
a
detestable
and
odious
vice
.
<EOS>
if
you
think
proper
,
therefore
,
to
conceal
any
infirmity
of
mine
(
for
such
I
may
have
,
since
no
man
be
perfectly
perfect
)
,
I
promise
you
I
will
not
betray
myself
.
<EOS>
thing
may
be
fitting
to
be
do
,
which
be
not
fitting
to
be
boast
of
;
for
by
the
perverse
judgment
of
the
world
,
that
often
become
the
subject
of
censure
,
which
be
,
in
truth
,
not
only
innocent
but
laudable
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
right
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Jones
:
"
<EOS>
what
can
be
more
innocent
than
the
indulgence
of
a
natural
appetite
?
<EOS>
or
what
more
laudable
than
the
propagation
of

?
<EOS>
"
 
"
to
be
serious
with
you
,
"
answer
Square
,
"
I
profess
they
always
appear
so
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
yet
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
you
be
of
a
different
opinion
when
my
affair
with
this
girl
be
first
discover
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
must
confess
,
"
say
Square
,
"
as
the
matter
be
misrepresent
to
me
,
by
that
parson
Thwackum
,
I
may
condemn
the
corruption
of
innocence
<EOS>
:
it
be
that
,
sir
,
it
be
that
 
and
that
:
for
you
must
know
,
Mr

,
in
the
consideration
of

very
minute
circumstance
,
sir
,
very
minute
circumstance
cause
great
alteration
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
be
that
as
it
will
,
it
shall
be
your
own
fault
,
as
I
have
promise
you
,
if
you
ever
hear
any
more
of
this

<EOS>
behave
kindly
to
the

and
I
will
never
open
my
lip
concern
the
matter
to
any

<EOS>
and
,
Molly
,
do
you
be
faithful
to
your
friend
,
and
I
will
not
only
forgive
your
infidelity
to
me
,
but
will
do
you
all
the
service
I
can
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
take
a
hasty
leave
,
and
,
slip
down
the
ladder
,
retire
with
much
expedition
.
  
<EOS>
Square
be
rejoice
to
find
this
adventure
be
likely
to
have
no
bad
conclusion
;
and
as
for
Molly
,
be
recover
from
her
confusion
,
she
begin
at
first
to
upbraid
Square
with
have
be
the
occasion
of
her
loss
of
Jones
;
but
that
gentleman
soon
find
the
mean
of
mitigate
her
anger
,
partly
by
caress
,
and
partly
by
a
small
nostrum
from
his
purse
,
of
wonderful
and
approve
efficacy
in
purge
off
the
ill
humour
of
the
mind
,
and
in
restore
it
to
a
good
temper
.
  
<EOS>
She
then
pour
forth
a
vast
profusion
of
tenderness
towards
her
new
lover
;
turn
all
she
have
say
to
Jones
,
and
Jones
himself
,
into
ridicule
;
and
vow
,
though
he
once
have
the
possession
of
her
person
,
that
none
but
Square
have
ever
be
master
of
her
heart
.
    
<EOS>
by
compare
which
with
the
former
,
the
reader
may
possibly
correct
some
abuse
which
he
hath
formerly
be
guilty
of
in
the
application
of
the
word
love
.
 
<EOS>
the
infidelity
of
Molly
,
which
Jones
have
now
discover
,
would
,
perhaps
,
have
vindicate
a
much
great
degree
of
resentment
than
he
express
on
the
occasion
;
and
if
he
have
abandon
her
directly
from
that
moment
,
very
few
,
I
believe
,
would
have
blame
him
.
  
<EOS>
Certain
,
however
,
it
be
,
that
he
see
her
in
the
light
of
compassion
;
and
though
his
love
to
her
be
not
of
that
kind
which
could
give
him
any
great
uneasiness
at
her
inconstancy
,
yet
be
he
not
a
little
shocked
on
reflect
that
he
have
himself
originally
corrupt
her
innocence
;
for
to
this
corruption
he
impute
all
the
vice
into
which
she
appear
now
so
likely
to
plunge
herself
.
  
<EOS>
this
consideration
give
him
no
little
uneasiness
,
till
Betty
,
the
eld
sister
,
be
so
kind
,
some
time
afterwards
,
entirely
to
cure
him
by
a
hint
,
that
one
Will
Barnes
,
and
not
himself
,
have
be
the
first
seducer
of
Molly
;
and
that
the
little
child
,
which
he
have
hitherto
so
certainly
conclude
to
be
his
own
,
may
very
probably
have
an
equal
title
,
at
least
,
to
claim
barne
for
its
father
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
eagerly
pursue
this
scent
when
he
have
first
receive
it
;
and
in
a
very
short
time
be
sufficiently
assure
that
the
girl
have
tell
him
truth
,
not
only
by
the
confession
of
the
fellow
,
but
at
last
by
that
of
Molly
herself
.
  
<EOS>
this
Will
Barnes
be
a
country
gallant
,
and
have
acquire
as
many
trophy
of
this
kind
as
any
ensign
or
attorney
's
clerk
in
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
indeed
,
reduce
several
woman
to
a
state
of
utter
profligacy
,
have
break
the
heart
of
some
,
and
have
the
honour
of
occasion
the
violent
death
of
one
poor
girl
,
who
have
either
drown
herself
,
or
,
what
be
rather
more
probable
,
have
be
drown
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
among
other
of
his
conquest
,
this
fellow
have
triumph
over
the
heart
of
Betty
Seagrim
.
<EOS>
He
have
make
love
to
her
long
before
Molly
be
grow
to
be
a
fit
object
of
that
pastime
;
but
have
afterwards
desert
her
,
and
apply
to
her
sister
,
with
whom
he
have
almost
immediate
success
.
<EOS>
now
Will
have
,
in
reality
,
the
sole
possession
of
Molly
's
affection
,
while
Jones
and
Square
be
almost
equally
sacrifice
to
her
interest
and
to
her
pride
.
  
<EOS>
hence
have
grow
that
implacable
hatred
which
we
have
before
see
rage
in
the
mind
of
Betty
;
though
we
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
assign
this
cause
<EOS>
sooner
,
as
envy
itself
alone
be
adequate
to
all
the
effect
we
have
mention
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
be
become
perfectly
easy
by
possession
of
this
secret
with
regard
to
Molly
;
but
as
to
Sophia
,
he
be
far
from
be
in
a
state
of
tranquillity
;
nay
,
indeed
,
he
be
under
the
most
violent
perturbation
;
his
heart
be
now
,
if
I
may
use
the
metaphor
,
entirely
evacuate
,
and
Sophia
take
absolute
possession
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
love
her
with
an
unbounded
passion
,
and
plainly
see
the
tender
sentiment
she
have
for
him
;
yet
could
not
this
assurance
lessen
his
despair
of
obtain
the
consent
of
her
father
,
nor
the
horror
which
attend
his
pursuit
of
her
by
any
base
or
treacherous
method
.
  
<EOS>
the
injury
which
he
must
thus
do
to
Mr
Western
,
and
the
concern
which
would
accrue
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
be
circumstance
that
torment
him
all
day
,
and
haunt
him
on
his
pillow
at
night
.
<EOS>
His
life
be
a
constant
struggle
between
honour
and
inclination
,
which
alternately
triumph
over
each
other
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
often
resolve
,
in
the
absence
of
Sophia
,
to
leave
her
father
's
house
,
and
to
see
her
no
more
;
and
as
often
,
in
her
presence
,
forget
all
those
resolution
,
and
determine
to
pursue
her
at
the
hazard
of
his
life
,
and
at
the
forfeiture
of
what
be
much
dearer
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
this
conflict
begin
soon
to
produce
very
strong
and
visible
effect
:
for
he
lose
all
his
usual
sprightliness
and
gaiety
of
temper
,
and
become
not
only
melancholy
when
alone
,
but
dejected
and
absent
in
company
;
nay
,
if
ever
he
put
on
a
force
mirth
,
to
comply
with
Mr
Western
's
humour
,
the
constraint
appear
so
plain
,
that
he
seem
to
have
be
give
the
strong
evidence
of
what
he
endeavour
to
conceal
by
such
ostentation
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
,
perhaps
,
be
a
question
,
whether
the
art
which
he
use
to
conceal
his
passion
,
or
the
mean
which
honest
nature
employ
to
reveal
it
,
betray
him
most
:
for
while
art
make
him
more
than
ever
reserve
to
Sophia
,
and
forbad
him
to
address
any
of
his
discourse
to
her
,
nay
,
to
avoid
meet
her
eye
,
with
the
utmost
caution
;
nature
be
no
less
busy
in
counterplot
him
.
<EOS>
hence
,
at
the
approach
of
the
young
lady
,
he
grow
pale
;
and
if
this
be
sudden
,
start
.
<EOS>
if
his
eye
accidentally
meet
her
,
the
blood
rush
into
his
cheek
,
and
his
countenance
become
all
over
scarlet
.
<EOS>
if
common
civility
ever
oblige
him
to
speak
to
her
,
as
to
drink
her
health
at
table
,
his
tongue
be
sure
to
falter
.
<EOS>
if
he
touch
her
,
his
hand
,
nay
his
whole
frame
,
tremble
.
<EOS>
and
if
any
discourse
tend
,
however
remotely
,
to
raise
the
idea
of
love
,
an
involuntary
sigh
seldom
fail
to
steal
from
his
bosom
.
<EOS>
Most
of
which
accident
nature
be
wonderfully
industrious
to
throw
daily
in
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
all
these
symptom
escape
the
notice
of
the
squire
:
but
not
so
of
Sophia
.
<EOS>
She
soon
perceive
these
agitation
of
mind
in
Jones
,
and
be
at
no
loss
to
discover
the
cause
;
for
indeed
she
recognize
it
in
her
own
breast
.
<EOS>
and
this
recognition
be
,
I
suppose
,
that
sympathy
which
hath
be
so
often
note
in
lover
,
and
which
will
sufficiently
account
for
her
be
so
much
quicker
-
sight
than
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
to
say
the
truth
,
there
be
a
more
simple
and
plain
method
of
account
for
that
prodigious
superiority
of
penetration
which
we
must
observe
in
some
man
over
the
rest
of
the
human
specie
,
and
one
which
will
serve
not
only
in
the
case
of
lover
,
but
of
all
other
.
<EOS>
from
whence
be
it
that
the
knave
be
generally
so
quick
-
sight
to
those
symptom
and
operation
of
knavery
,
which
often
dupe
an
honest
man
of
a
much
well
understanding
?
<EOS>
there
surely
be
no
general
sympathy
among
knave
;
nor
have
they
,
like
freemason
,
any
common
sign
of
communication
.
<EOS>
in
reality
,
it
be
only
because
they
have
the
same
thing
in
their
head
,
and
their
thought
be
turn
the
same
way
.
<EOS>
thus
,
that
Sophia
see
,
and
that
Western
do
not
see
,
the
plain
symptom
of
love
in
Jones
can
be
no
wonder
,
when
we
consider
that
the
idea
of
love
never
enter
into
the
head
of
the
father
,
whereas
the
daughter
,
at
present
,
thought
of
nothing
else
.
  
<EOS>
when
Sophia
be
well
satisfied
of
the
violent
passion
which
torment
poor
Jones
,
and
no
less
certain
that
she
herself
be
its
object
,
she
have
not
the
least
difficulty
in
discover
the
true
cause
of
his
present
behaviour
.
<EOS>
this
highly
endear
him
to
her
,
and
raise
in
her
mind
two
of
the
good
affection
which
any
lover
can
wish
to
raise
in
a
mistress
 
<EOS>
these
be
,
esteem
and
pity
 
for
sure
the
most
outrageously
rigid
among
her
sex
<EOS>
will
excuse
her
pity
a
man
whom
she
see
miserable
on
her
own
account
;
nor
can
they
blame
her
for
esteem
one
who
visibly
,
from
the
most
honourable
motive
,
endeavour
to
smother
a
flame
in
his
own
bosom
,
which
,
like
the
famous
spartan
theft
,
be
prey
upon
and
consume
his
very
vital
.
<EOS>
thus
his
backwardness
,
his
shun
her
,
his
coldness
,
and
his
silence
,
be
the
forward
,
the
most
diligent
,
the
warm
,
and
most
eloquent
advocate
;
and
work
so
violently
on
her
sensible
and
tender
heart
,
that
she
soon
feel
for
him
all
those
gentle
sensation
which
be
consistent
with
a
virtuous
and
elevated
female
mind
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
all
which
esteem
,
gratitude
,
and
pity
,
can
inspire
in
such
towards
an
agreeable
man
 
indeed
,
all
which
the
nice
delicacy
can
allow
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
she
be
in
love
with
him
to
distraction
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
this
young
couple
accidentally
meet
in
the
garden
,
at
the
end
of
the
two
walk
which
be
both
bound
by
that
canal
in
which
Jones
have
formerly
risque
drown
to
retrieve
the
little
bird
that
Sophia
have
there
lose
.
  
<EOS>
this
place
have
be
of
late
much
frequent
by
Sophia
.
<EOS>
here
she
use
to
ruminate
,
with
a
mixture
of
pain
and
pleasure
,
on
an
incident
which
,
however
trifle
in
itself
,
have
possibly
sow
the
first
seed
of
that
affection
which
be
now
arrive
to
such
maturity
in
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
here
then
this
young
couple
meet
.
<EOS>
They
be
almost
close
together
before
either
of
them
know
anything
of
the
other
's
approach
.
<EOS>
a
bystander
would
have
discover
sufficient
mark
of
confusion
in
the
countenance
of
each
;
but
they
feel
too
much
themselves
to
make
any
observation
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Jones
have
a
little
recover
his
first
surprize
,
he
accost
the
young
lady
with
some
of
the
ordinary
form
of
salutation
,
which
she
in
the
same
manner
return
;
and
their
conversation
begin
,
as
usual
,
on
the
delicious
beauty
of
the
morning
.
<EOS>
hence
they
past
to
the
beauty
of
the
place
,
on
which
Jones
launch
forth
very
high
encomium
.
<EOS>
when
they
come
to
the
tree
whence
he
have
formerly
tumble
into
the
canal
,
Sophia
could
not
help
remind
him
of
that
accident
,
and
say
,
"
I
fancy
,
Mr
Jones
,
you
have
some
little
shuddering
when
you
see
that
water
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
madam
,
"
answer
Jones
,
"
the
concern
you
feel
at
the
loss
of
your
little
bird
will
always
appear
to
me
the
high
circumstance
in
that
adventure
.
<EOS>
poor
little
Tommy
!
<EOS>
there
be
the
branch
he
stand
upon
.
<EOS>
how
could
the
little
wretch
have
the
folly
to
fly
away
from
that
state
of
happiness
in
which
I
have
the
honour
to
place
him
?
<EOS>
His
fate
be
a
just
punishment
for
his
ingratitude
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
Mr
Jones
,
"
say
she
,
"
your
gallantry
very
narrowly
escape
as
severe
a
fate
.
<EOS>
sure
the
remembrance
must
affect
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
madam
,
"
answer
he
,
"
if
I
have
any
reason
to
reflect
with
sorrow
on
it
,
it
be
,
perhaps
,
that
the
water
have
not
be
a
little
deep
,
by
which
I
may
have
escape
many
bitter
heart
-
ache
that
Fortune
seem
to
have
in
store
for
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Fie
,
Mr
Jones
!
"
reply
Sophia
<EOS>
;
"
I
be
sure
you
can
not
be
in
earnest
now
.
<EOS>
this
affected
contempt
of
life
be
only
an
excess
of
your
complacence
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
would
endeavour
to
lessen
the
obligation
of
have
twice
venture
it
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
beware
the
third
time
.
"
<EOS>
She
speak
these
last
word
with
a
smile
,
and
a
softness
inexpressible
.
<EOS>
Jones
answer
with
a
sigh
,
"
He
fear
it
be
already
too
late
for
caution
:
"
and
then
look
tenderly
and
stedfastly
on
her
,
he
cry
,
"
oh
,
Miss
Western
!
<EOS>
can
you
desire
me
to
live
?
<EOS>
Can
you
wish
me
so
ill
?
"
<EOS>
Sophia
,
look
down
on
the
ground
,
answer
with
some
hesitation
,
"
indeed
,
Mr
Jones
,
I
do
not
wish
you
ill
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
know
too
well
that
heavenly
temper
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
that
divine
goodness
,
which
be
beyond
every
other
charm
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Nay
,
now
,
"
answer
she
,
"
I
understand
you
not
.
<EOS>
I
can
stay
no
longer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
 
<EOS>
I
would
not

"
<EOS>
cry
he
;
"
nay
,
I
can
not
be
understand
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
meet
you
here
so
unexpectedly
,
I
have
be
unguarded
:
for
Heaven
's
sake
pardon
me
,
if
I
have

anything
to

you

<EOS>
I
do
not

it

<EOS>
indeed
,
I
would
rather
have
die
 
nay
,
the
very
thought
would
kill
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
surprize
me
,
"
answer
she
.
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
possibly
think
you
have
offend
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
fear
,
madam
,
"
say
he
,
"
easily
run
into
madness
;
and
there
be
no
degree
of
fear
like
that
which
I
feel
of
offend
you
.
<EOS>
how
can
I
speak
then
?
<EOS>
nay
,
do
not
look
angrily
at
me
:
one
frown
will
destroy
me
.
<EOS>
I
mean
nothing
.
<EOS>
blame
my
eye
,
or
blame
those
beauty
.
<EOS>
what
be
I
say
?
<EOS>
pardon
me
if
I
have
say
too
much
.
<EOS>
My
heart
overflow
.
<EOS>
I
have
struggle
with
my
love
to
the
utmost
,
and
have
endeavour
to
conceal
a
fever
which
prey
on
my
vital
,
and
will
,
I
hope
,
soon
make
it
impossible
for
me
ever
to
offend
you
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Jones
now
fall
a
trembling
as
if
he
have
be
shake
with
the
fit
of
an
ague
.
<EOS>
Sophia
,
who
be
in
a
situation
not
very
different
from
his
,
answer
in
these
word
:
"
Mr
Jones
,
I
will
not
affect
to
misunderstand
you
;
indeed
,
I
understand
you
too
well
;
but
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
if
you
have
any
affection
for
me
,
let
me
make
the
good
of
my
way
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
may
be
able
to
support
myself
thither
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
,
who
be
hardly
able
to
support
himself
,
offer
her
his
arm
,
which
she
condescend
to
accept
,
but
beg
he
would
not
mention
a
word
more
to
her
of
this
nature
at
present
.
<EOS>
He
promise
he
would
not
;
insist
only
on
her
forgiveness
of
what
love
,
without
the
leave
of
his
will
,
have
force
from
him
:
this
,
she
tell
him
,
he
know
how
to
obtain
by
his
future
behaviour
;
and
thus
this
young
pair
totter
and
tremble
along
,
the
lover
not
once
dare
to
squeeze
the
hand
of
his
mistress
,
though
it
be
lock
in
his
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
immediately
retire
to
her
chamber
,
where
Mrs
Honour
and
the
hartshorn
be
summon
to
her
assistance
.
<EOS>
as
to
poor
Jones
,
the
only
relief
to
his
distemper
mind
be
an
unwelcome
piece
of
news
,
which
,
as
it
open
a
scene
of
different
nature
from
those
in
which
the
reader
hath
lately
be
conversant
,
will
be
communicate
to
him
in
the
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
Mr
Allworthy
appear
on
a
sick
-
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Western
be
become
so
fond
of
Jones
that
he
be
unwilling
to
part
with
him
,
though
his
arm
have
be
long
since
cure
;
and
<EOS>
Jones
,
either
from
the
love
of
sport
,
or
from
some
other
reason
,
be
easily
persuade
to
continue
at
his
house
,
which
he
do
sometimes
for
a
fortnight
together
without
pay
a
single
visit
at
Mr
Allworthy
's
;
nay
,
without
ever
hear
from
thence
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
have
be
for
some
day
indispose
with
a
cold
,
which
have
be
attend
with
a
little
fever
.
<EOS>
this
he
have
,
however
,
neglect
;
as
it
be
usual
with
him
to
do
all
manner
of
disorder
which
do
not
confine
him
to
his
bed
,
or
prevent
his
several
faculty
from
perform
their
ordinary
function
;
 
a
conduct
which
we
would
by
no
means
be
think
to
approve
or
recommend
to
imitation
;
for
surely
the
gentleman
of
the
aesculapian
art
be
in
the
right
in
advise
,
that
the
moment
the
disease
have
enter
at
one
door
,
the
physician
should
be
introduce
at
the
other
:
what
else
be
mean
by
that
old
adage
,
Venienti
occurrite
morbo
?
"
<EOS>
oppose
a
distemper
at
its
first
approach
.
"
<EOS>
thus
the
doctor
and
the
disease
meet
in
fair
and
equal
conflict
;
whereas
,
by
give
time
to
the
latter
,
we
often
suffer
him
to
fortify
and
entrench
himself
,
like
a
french
army
;
so
that
the
learn
gentleman
find
it
very
difficult
,
and
sometimes
impossible
,
to
come
at
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
nay
,
sometimes
by
gain
time
the
disease
apply
to
the
french
military
politic
,
and
corrupt
nature
over
to
his
side
,
and
then
all
the
power
of
physic
must
arrive
too
late
.
<EOS>
agreeable
to
these
observation
be
,
I
remember
,
the
complaint
of
the
great
Doctor
Misaubin
,
who
use
very
pathetically
to
lament
the
late
application
which
be
make
to
his
skill
,
say
,
"
Bygar
,
me
believe
my
pation
take
me
for
de
undertaker
,
for
dey
never
send
for
me
till

"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
's
distemper
,
by
mean
of
this
neglect
,
gain
such
ground
,
that
,
when
the
increase
of
his
fever
oblige
him
to
send
for
assistance
,
the
doctor
at
his
first
arrival
shake
his
head
,
wish
he
have
be
send
for
sooner
,
and
intimate
that
he
think
him
in
very
imminent
danger
.
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
,
who
have
settle
all
his
affair
in
this
world
,
and
be
as
well
prepare
as
it
be
possible
for
human
nature
to
be
for
the
other
,
receive
this
information
with
the
utmost
calmness
and
unconcern
.
<EOS>
He
could
,
indeed
,
whenever
he
lay
himself
down
to
rest
,
say
with
Cato
in
the
tragical
poem
                                  
<EOS>
let
guilt
or
fear
     
<EOS>
Disturb
man
's
rest
<EOS>
:
cato
know
neither
of
them
;
     
Indifferent
in
his
choice
to
sleep
or
die
.
  
<EOS>
in
reality
,
he
could
say
this
with
ten
time
more
reason
and
confidence
than
Cato
,
or
any
other
proud
fellow
among
the
antient
or
modern
hero
;
for
he
be
not
only
devoid
of
fear
,
but
may
be
consider
as
a
faithful
labourer
,
when
at
the
end
of
harvest
he
be
summon
to
receive
his
reward
at
the
hand
of
a
bountiful
master
.
  
<EOS>
the
good
man
give
immediate
order
for
all
his
family
to
be
summon
round
him
.
<EOS>
none
of
these
be
then
abroad
,
but
Mrs
Blifil
,
who
have
be
some
time
in
London
,
and
Mr
Jones
,
whom
the
reader
hath
just
part
from
at
Mr
Western
's
,
and
who
receive
this
summon
just
as
Sophia
have
leave
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
news
of
Mr
Allworthy
's
danger
(
for
the
servant
tell
him
he
be
die
)
drive
all
thought
of
love
out
of
his
head
.
<EOS>
He
hurry
instantly
into
the
chariot
which
be
send
for
him
,
and
order
the
coachman
to
drive
with
all
imaginable
haste
;
nor
do
the
idea
of
Sophia
,
I
believe
,
once
occur
to
him
on
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
the
whole
family
,
namely
,
Mr
Blifil
,
Mr
Jones
,
Mr
Thwackum
,
Mr
Square
,
and
some
of
the
servant
(
for
such
be
Mr
Allworthy
's
order
)
<EOS>
be
all
assemble
round
his
bed
,
the
good
man
sit
up
in
it
,
and
be
begin
to
speak
,
when
Blifil
fall
to
blubbering
,
and
begin
to
express
very
loud
and
bitter
lamentation
.
<EOS>
upon
this
Mr
Allworthy
shake
him
by
the
hand
,
and
say
,
"
do
not
sorrow
thus
,
my
dear
nephew
,
at
the
most
ordinary
of
all
human
occurrence
.
<EOS>
when
misfortune
befal
our
friend
we
be
justly
grieve
;
for
those
be
accident
which
may
often
have
be
avoid
,
and
which
may
seem
to
render
the
lot
of
one
man
more
peculiarly
unhappy
than
that
of
other
;
but
death
be
certainly
unavoidable
,
and
be
that
common
lot
in
which
alone
the
fortune
of
all
man
agree
:
nor
be
the
time
when
this
happen
to
us
very
material
.
<EOS>
if
the
wise
of
man
hath
compare
life
to
a
span
,
surely
we
may
be
allow
to
consider
it
as
a
day
.
<EOS>
It
be
my
fate
to
leave
it
in
the
evening
;
but
those
who
be
take
away
earlier
have
only
lose
a
few
hour
,
at
the
good
little
worth
lamenting
,
and
much
oftener
hour
of
labour
and
fatigue
,
of
pain
and
sorrow
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
roman
poet
,
I
remember
,
liken
our
leave
life
to
our
departure
from
a
feast
;
 
a
thought
which
hath
often
occur
to
me
when
I
have
see
man
struggle
to
protract
an
entertainment
,
and
to
enjoy
the
company
of
their
friend
a
few
moment
longer
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
how
short
be
the
most
protract
of
such
enjoyment
!
<EOS>
how
immaterial
the
difference
between
him
who
retire
the
soon
,
and
him
who
stay
the
late
!
<EOS>
this
be
see
life
in
the
good
view
,
and
this
unwillingness
to
quit
our
friend
be
the
most
amiable
motive
from
which
we
can
derive
the
fear
of
death
;
and
yet
the
long
enjoyment
which
we
can
hope
for
of
this
kind
be
of
so
trivial
a
duration
,
that
it
be
to
a
wise
man
truly
contemptible
.
<EOS>
few
man
,
I
own
,
think
in
this
manner
;
for
,
indeed
,
few
man
think
of
death
till
they
be
in
its
jaw
.
<EOS>
however
gigantic
and
terrible
an
object
this
may
appear
when
it
approach
them
,
they
be
nevertheless
incapable
of
see
it
at
any
distance
;
<EOS>
nay
,
though
they
have
be
ever
so
much
alarmed
and
frightened
when
they
have
apprehend
themselves
in
danger
of
die
,
they
be
no
sooner
clear
from
this
apprehension
than
even
the
fear
of
it
be
erase
from
their
mind
.

<EOS>
Nephew
Blifil
,
I
leave
you
the
heir
to
my
whole
estate
,
except
only
L500
a
-
year
,
which
be
to
revert
to
you
after
the
death
of
your
mother
,
and
except
one
other
estate
of
L500
a
-
year
,
and
the
sum
of
L6000
,
which
I
have
bestow
in
the
follow
manner
:
  
"
the
estate
of
L500
a
-
year
I
have
give
to
you
,
Mr
Jones
:
<EOS>
and
as
I
know
the
inconvenience
which
attend
the
want
of
ready
money
,
I
have
add
L1000
in
specie
.
<EOS>
in
this
I
know
not
whether
I
have
exceed
or
fall
short
of
your
expectation
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
will
think
I
have
give
you
too
little
,
and
the
world
will
be
as
ready
to
condemn
me
for
give
you
too
much
;
but
the
latter
censure
I
despise
;
and
as
to
the
former
,
unless
you
should
entertain
that
common
error
which
I
have
often
hear
in
my
life
plead
as
an
excuse
for
a
total
want
of
charity
,
namely
,
that
instead
of
raise
gratitude
by
voluntary
act
of
bounty
,
we
be
apt
to
raise
demand
,
which
of
all
other
be
the
most
boundless
and
most
difficult
to
satisfy

<EOS>
pardon
me
<EOS>
the
bare
mention

I
will
not

any

Jones
fling
himself
at
his
benefactor

take
eagerly
hold
of
his

assure
him
his
goodness
to
him
,
both
now
and
all
other

have
so
infinitely
exceed
not
only
his
merit

his

express
his
sense
of
it

<EOS>

I
assure
you
,
sir

"
say
he
,
"
your
present
generosity
hath
leave
me
no
other
concern
than
for
the

melancholy
occasion

oh

my
friend
,
my
father

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
his
word
choake
him
,
and
he
turn
away
to
hide
a
tear
which
be
start
from
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
then
gently
squeeze
his
hand
,
and
proceed
thus
:
"
I
be
convinced
,
my
child
,
that
you
have
much
goodness
,
generosity
,
and
honour
,
in
your
temper
:
if
you
will
add
prudence
and
religion
to
these
,
you
must
be
happy
;
for
the
three
former
quality
,
I
admit
,
make
you
worthy
of
happiness
,
but
they
be
the
latter
only
which
will
put
you
in
possession
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
one
thousand
pound
I
have
give
to
you
,
Mr
Thwackum
;
a
sum
I
be
convinced
which
greatly
exceed
your
desire
,
as
well
as
your
want
.
<EOS>
however
,
you
will
receive
it
as
a
memorial
of
my
friendship
;
and
whatever
superfluity
may
redound
to
you
,
that
piety
which
you
so
rigidly
maintain
will
instruct
you
how
to
dispose
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
like
sum
,
Mr
Square
,
I
have
bequeath
to
you
.
<EOS>
this
,
I
hope
,
will
enable
you
to
pursue
your
profession
with
well
success
than
hitherto
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
observe
with
concern
,
that
distress
be
more
apt
to
excite
contempt
than
commiseration
,
especially
among
man
of
business
,
with
whom
poverty
be
understand
to
indicate
want
of
ability
.
<EOS>
but
the
little
I
have
be
able
to
leave
you
will
extricate
you
from
those
difficulty
with
which
you
have
formerly
struggle
;
and
then
I
doubt
not
<EOS>
but
you
will
meet
with
sufficient
prosperity
to
supply
what
a
man
of
your
philosophical
temper
will
require
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
find
myself
grow
faint
,
so
I
shall
refer
you
to
my
will
for
my
disposition
of
the
residue
.
<EOS>
My
servant
will
there
find
some
token
to
remember
me
by
;
and
there
be
a
few
charity
which
,
I
trust
,
my
executor
will
see
faithfully
perform
.
<EOS>
bless
you
all

<EOS>
I
be
set
out
a
little
before
you

"
    
<EOS>
here
a
footman
come
hastily
into
the
room
,
and
say
there
be
an
attorney
from
Salisbury
who
have
a
particular
message
,
which
he
say
he
must
communicate
to
Mr
Allworthy
himself
:
that
he
seem
in
a
violent
hurry
,
and
protest
he
have
so
much
business
to
do
,
that
,
if
he
could
cut
himself
into
four
quarter
,
all
would
not
be
sufficient
.
  
<EOS>
"
go
,
child
,
"
say
Allworthy
to
Blifil
,
"
see
what
the
gentleman
want
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
able
to
do
any
business
now
,
nor
can
he
have
any
with
me
,
in
which
you
be
not
at
present
more
concerned
than
myself
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
really
be
 
<EOS>
I
be
incapable
of
see
any
one
at
present
,
or
of
any
long
attention
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
then
salute
them
all
,
say
,
perhaps
he
should
be
able
to
see
them
again
,
but
he
should
be
now
glad
to
compose
himself
a
little
,
find
that
he
have
too
much
exhaust
his
spirit
in
discourse
.
  
<EOS>
some
of
the
company
shed
tear
at
their
parting
;
and
even
the
philosopher
Square
wipe
his
eye
,
albeit
unused
to
the
melt
mood
.
<EOS>
as
to
Mrs
Wilkins
,
she
dropt
her
pearl
as
fast
as
the
arabian
tree
their
medicinal
gum
;
for
this
be
a
ceremonial
which
that
gentlewoman
never
omit
on
a
proper
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
Mr
Allworthy
again
lay
himself
down
on
his
pillow
,
and
endeavour
to
compose
himself
to
rest
.
    
<EOS>
contain
matter
rather
natural
than
pleasing
.
 
<EOS>
besides
grief
for
her
master
,
there
be
another
source
for
that
briny
stream
which
so
plentifully
rise
above
the
two
mountainous
cheek
-
bone
of
the
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
She
be
no
sooner
retire
,
than
she
begin
to
mutter
to
herself
in
the
following
pleasant
strain
:
"
<EOS>
sure
master
may
have
make
some
difference
,
methink
,
between
me
and
the
other
servant
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
hath
leave
me
mourn
;
but
,
i'fackins
!
<EOS>
if
that
be
all
,
the
devil
shall
wear
it
for
him
,
for
me

<EOS>
I
would
have
<EOS>
his
worship
know
I
be
no
beggar
.
<EOS>
I
have
save
five
hundred
pound
in
his
service
,
and
after
all
to
be
use
in
this
manner
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
encouragement
to
servant
to
be
honest
;
and
to
be
sure
,
if
I
have
take
a
little
something
now
and
then
,
other
have
take
ten
time
as
much
;
and
now
we
be
all
put
in
a
lump
together
.
<EOS>
if
so
be
that
it
be
so
,
the
legacy
may
go
to
the
devil
with
him
that
give
it
.
<EOS>
no
,
I
will
not
give
it
up
neither
,
because
that
will
please
some
folk
.
<EOS>
no
,
I
will
buy
the
gay
gown
I
can
get
,
and
dance
over
the
old
curmudgeon
's
grave
in
it
.
<EOS>
this
be
my
reward
for
take
his
part
so
often
,
when
all
the
country
have
cry
shame
of
him
,
for
breed
up
his
bastard
in
that
manner
;
but
he
be
go
now
where
he
must
pay
for
all
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
become
him
well
to
have
repent
of
his
sin
on
his
deathbed
,
than
to
glory
in
them
,
and
give
away
his
estate
out
of
his
own
family

a
misbegotten
child

in
his

a
pretty
story

forgive

warrant
he
hath
many
more
bastard
to
answer
for

if
the
truth
be
know

<EOS>
one
comfort
be
,
they
will
all
be

go
now

will
find
some
token

those
be
the
very
word

I
shall
never
forget
them
,
if
I
be
to
live
a
thousand
year

<EOS>
ay
,
ay
,
I
shall
remember
you

huddle
me
among

servant

<EOS>
one
would
have
think
he
may
have
mention
my
name
as
well
as
that
of
Square

but
he
be
a
gentleman
forsooth

though
he
have
not

on
his
back

hither
first

come
up
with
such

hath
live
here
this
many
year

I
do
not

there
be
arrow

shall
wait
upon
such
a

"
<EOS>
much
more
of
the
like
kind
she
mutter
to
herself
;
but
this
taste
shall
suffice
to
the
reader
.
  
<EOS>
neither
Thwackum
nor
Square
be
much
better
satisfied
with
their
legacy
.
<EOS>
though
they
breathe
not
their
resentment
so
loud
,
yet
from
the
discontent
which
appear
in
their
countenance
,
as
well
as
from
the
follow
dialogue
,
we
collect
that
no
great
pleasure
reign
in
their
mind
.
  
<EOS>
about
an
hour
after
they
have
leave
the
sick
-
room
,
Square
meet
Thwackum
in
the
hall
and
accost
him
thus
:
"
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
have
you
hear
any
news
of
your
friend
since
we
part
from
him
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
mean
Mr
Allworthy
,
"
answer
Thwackum
,
"
I
think
you
may
rather
give
him
the
appellation
of
your
friend
;
for
he
seem
to
me
to
have
deserve
that
title
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
title
be
as
good
on
your
side
,
"
reply
Square
,
"
for
his
bounty
,
such
as
it
be
,
hath
be
equal
to
both
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
have
mention
it
first
,
"
cry
Thwackum
,
"
<EOS>
but
since
you
begin
,
I
must
inform
you
I
be
of
a
different
opinion
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
wide
distinction
between
voluntary
favour
and
reward
.
<EOS>
the
duty
I
have
do
in
his
family
,
and
the
care
I
have
take
in
the
education
of
his
two
boy
,
be
service
for
which
some
man
may
have
expect
a
great
return
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
you
imagine
I
be
therefore
dissatisfied
;
for
St
Paul
hath
teach
me
to
be
content
with
the
little
I
have
.
<EOS>
have
the
modicum
be
less
,
I
should
have
know
my
duty
.
<EOS>
but
though
the
scripture
oblige
me
to
remain
contented
,
it
doth
not
enjoin
me
to
shut
my
eye
to
my
own
merit
,
nor
restrain
me
from
see
when
I
be
injure
by
an
unjust
comparison
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
since
you
provoke
me
,
"
return
Square
,
"
that
injury
be
do
to
me
;
nor
do
I
ever
imagine
Mr
Allworthy
have
hold
my
friendship
<EOS>
so
light
,
as
to
put
me
in
balance
with
one
who
receive
his
wage
.
<EOS>
I
know
to
what
it
be
owe
;
it
proceed
from
those
narrow
principle
which
you
have
be
so
long
endeavour
to
infuse
into
him
,
in
contempt
of
everything
which
be
great
and
noble
.
<EOS>
the
beauty
and
loveliness
of
friendship
be
too
strong
for
dim
eye
,
nor
can
it
be
perceive
by
any
other
medium
than
that
unerring
rule
of
right
,
which
you
have
so
often
endeavour
to
ridicule
,
that
you
have
pervert
your
friend
's
understanding
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
"
cry
Thwackum
,
in
a
rage
,
"
I
wish
,
for
the
sake
of
his
soul
,
your
damnable
doctrine
have
not
pervert
his
faith
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
this
I
impute
his
present
behaviour
,
so
unbecome
a
Christian
.
<EOS>
who
but
an
atheist
could
think
of
leave
the
world
without
have
first
make
up
his
account
?
<EOS>
without
confess
his
sin
,
and
receive
that
absolution
which
he
know
he
have
one
in
the
house
duly
authorize
to
give
him
?
<EOS>
He
will
feel
the
want
of
these
necessary
when
it
be
too
late
,
when
he
be
arrive
at
that
place
where
there
be
wail
and
gnash
of
tooth
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
he
will
find
in
what
mighty
stead
that
heathen
goddess
,
that
virtue
,
which
you
and
all
other
deist
of
the
age
adore
,
will
stand
him
.
<EOS>
He
will
then
summon
his
priest
,
when
there
be
none
to
be
find
,
and
will
lament
the
want
of
that
absolution
,
without
which
no
sinner
can
be
safe
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
so
material
,
"
say
Square
,
"
why
do
not
you
present
it
<EOS>
him
of
your
own
accord
?
"
<EOS>
"
It
hath
no
virtue
,
"
cry
Thwackum
,
"
but
to
those
who
have
sufficient
grace
to
require
it
.
<EOS>
but
why
do
I
talk
thus
to
a
heathen
and
an
unbeliever
?
<EOS>
It
be
you
that
teach
him
this
lesson
,
for
which
you
have
be
well
reward
in
this
world
,
as
I
doubt
not
your
disciple
will
soon
be
in
the
other
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
what
you
mean
by
reward
,
"
say
Square
;
"
but
if
you
hint
at
that
pitiful
memorial
of
our
friendship
,
which
he
hath
think
fit
to
bequeath
me
,
I
despise
it
;
and
nothing
but
the
unfortunate
situation
of
my
circumstance
should
prevail
on
me
to
accept
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
physician
now
arrive
,
and
begin
to
inquire
of
the
two
disputant
,
how
we
all
do
above
-
stair
?
<EOS>
"
in
a
miserable

<EOS>
"
It
be
no
more
than
I
expect
,
"
cry
the
doctor
:
"
but
pray
what
symptom
have
appear
since
I
leave
you
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
good
one

I
be
afraid

"
reply
Thwackum
:
"
<EOS>
after
what
past
at
our
departure
,
I
think
there
be
little
hope
.
<EOS>
"
the
bodily
physician
,
perhaps
,
misunderstood
the
curer
of
soul
;
and
before
they
come
to
an
explanation
,
Mr
Blifil
come
to
them
with
a
most
melancholy
countenance
,
and
acquaint
them
that
he
bring
sad
news
,
that
his
mother
be
dead
at
Salisbury
;
that
she
have
be
seize
on
the
road
home
with
the
gout
in
her
head
and
stomach
,
which
have
carry
her
off
in
a
few
hour
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
good
-
lack
-
a
-
day
!
"
say
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
one
can
not
answer
for
event
;
but
I
wish
I
have
be
at
hand
,
to
have
be
call
in
.
<EOS>
the
gout
be
a
distemper
which
it
be
difficult
to
treat
;
yet
I
have
be
remarkably
successful
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
Thwackum
and
Square
both
condole
with
Mr
Blifil
for
the
loss
of
his
mother
,
which
the
one
advise
him
to
bear
like
a
man
,
and
the
other
like
a
Christian
.
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
say
he
know
very
well
we
be
all
mortal
,
and
he
would
endeavour
to
submit
to
his
loss
as
well
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
that
he
could
not
,
however
,
help
complain
a
little
against
the
peculiar
severity
of
his
fate
,
which
bring
the
news
of
so
great
a
calamity
to
him
by
surprize
,
and
that
at
a
time
when
he
hourly
expect
the
severest
blow
he
be
capable
of
feeling
from
the
malice
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
the
present
occasion
would
put
to
the
test
those
excellent
rudiment
which
he
have
learn
from
Mr
Thwackum
and
Mr
Square
;
and
it
would
be
entirely
owing
to
them
,
if
he
be
enable
to
survive
such
misfortune
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
debate
whether
Mr
Allworthy
should
be
inform
of
the
death
of
his
sister
.
<EOS>
this
the
doctor
violently
oppose
;
in
which
,
I
believe
,
the
whole
college
would
agree
with
him
:
but
Mr
Blifil
say
,
he
have
receive
such
positive
and
repeat
order
from
his
uncle
,
never
to
keep
any
secret
from
him
for
fear
of
the
disquietude
which
it
may
give
him
,
that
he
durst
not
think
of
disobedience
,
whatever
may
be
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
for
his
part
,
consider
the
religious
and
philosophic
temper
of
his
uncle
,
he
could
not
agree
with
the
doctor
in
his
apprehension
.
<EOS>
He
be
therefore
resolve
to
communicate
it
to
him
:
for
if
his
uncle
recover
(
as
he
heartily
pray
he
may
)
<EOS>
he
know
he
would
never
forgive
an
endeavour
to
keep
a
secret
of
this
kind
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
physician
be
force
to
submit
to
these
resolution
,
which
the
two
other
learn
gentleman
very
highly
commend
.
<EOS>
so
together
move
Mr
Blifil
and
the
doctor
toward
the
sick
-
room
;
where
the
physician
first
enter
,
and
approach
the
bed
,
in
order
to
feel
his
patient
's
pulse
,
which
he
have
no
sooner
do
,
than
he
declare
he
be
much
well
;
that
the
last
application
have
succeed
to
a
miracle
,
and
have
bring
the
fever
to
intermit
:
so
that
,
he
say
,
there
appear
now
to
be
as
little
danger
as
he
have
before
apprehend
<EOS>
there
be
hope
.
  
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
Mr
Allworthy
's
situation
have
never
be
so
bad
as
the
great
caution
of
the
doctor
have
represent
it
:
<EOS>
but
as
a
wise
general
never
despise
his
enemy
,
however
inferior
that
enemy
's
force
may
be
,
so
<EOS>
neither
doth
a
wise
physician
ever
despise
a
distemper
,
however
inconsiderable
.
<EOS>
as
the
former
preserve
the
same
strict
discipline
,
place
the
same
guard
,
and
employ
the
same
scout
,
though
the
enemy
be
never
so
weak
;
so
the
latter
maintain
the
same
gravity
of
countenance
,
and
shake
his
head
with
the
same
significant
air
,
let
the
distemper
be
never
so
trifling
.
<EOS>
and
both
,
among
many
other
good
one
,
may
assign
this
solid
reason
for
their
conduct
,
that
by
these
mean
the
great
glory
redound
to
them
if
they
gain
the
victory
,
and
the
less
disgrace
if
by
any
unlucky
accident
they
should
happen
to
be
conquer
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
have
no
sooner
lift
up
his
eye
,
and
thank
Heaven
for
these
hope
of
his
recovery
,
than
Mr
Blifil
draw
near
,
with
a
very
dejected
aspect
,
and
have
apply
his
handkerchief
to
his
eye
,
either
to
wipe
away
his
tear
,
or
to
do
as
Ovid
somewhere
express
himself
on
another
occasion
  
<EOS>
Si
nullus
erit
,
tamen
excute
nullum
,
       
<EOS>
if
there
be
none
,
then
wipe
away
that
none
,
  
he
communicate
to
his
uncle
what
the
reader
hath
be
just
before
acquaint
with
.
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
receive
the
news
with
concern
,
with
patience
,
and
with
resignation
.
<EOS>
He
dropt
a
tender
tear
,
then
compose
his
countenance
,
and
at
last
cry
,
"
the
Lord
's
will
be
do
in
everything
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
now
enquire
for
the
messenger
;
but
Blifil
tell
him
it
have
be
impossible
to
detain
him
a
moment
;
for
he
appear
by
the
great
hurry
he
be
in
to
have
some
business
of
importance
on
his
hand
;
that
he
complain
of
be
hurry
and
drive
and
tear
out
of
his
life
,
and
repeat
many
time
,
that
if
he
could
divide
himself
into
four
quarter
,
he
know
how
to
dispose
of
every
one
.
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
then
desire
Blifil
to
take
care
of
the
funeral
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
he
would
have
his
sister
deposit
in
his
own
chapel
;
and
as
to
the
particular
,
he
leave
them
to
his
own
discretion
,
only
mention
the
person
whom
he
would
have
employ
on
this
occasion
.
    
<EOS>
which
,
among
other
thing
,
may
serve
as
a
comment
on
that
say
of
Aeschines
,
that
"
drunkenness
show
the
mind
of
a
man
,
as
a
mirrour
reflect
his
person
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
reader
may
perhaps
wonder
at
hear
nothing
of
Mr
Jones
in
the
last
chapter
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
his
behaviour
be
so
different
from
that
of
the
person
there
mention
,
that
we
choose
not
to
confound
his
name
with
theirs
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
good
man
have
end
his
speech
,
Jones
be
the
last
who
desert
the
room
.
<EOS>
thence
he
retire
to
his
own
apartment
,
to
give
vent
to
his
concern
;
but
the
restlessness
of
his
mind
would
not
suffer
him
to
remain
long
there
;
he
slip
softly
therefore
to
Allworthy
's
chamber
-
door
,
where
he
listen
a
considerable
time
without
hear
any
kind
of
motion
within
,
unless
a
violent
snoring
,
which
at
last
his
fear
misrepresent
as
groan
.
<EOS>
this
so
alarm
him
,
that
he
could
not
forbear
enter
the
room
;
where
he
find
the
good
man
in
the
bed
,
in
a
sweet
compose
sleep
,
and
his
nurse
snore
in
the
above
mention
hearty
manner
,
at
the
bed
's
foot
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
take
the
only
method
of
silence
this
thorough
bass
,
whose
music
he
fear
may
disturb
Mr
Allworthy
;
and
then
sit
down
by
the
nurse
,
he
remain
motionless
till
Blifil
<EOS>
and
the
doctor
come
in
together
and
wake
the
sick
man
,
in
order
that
the
doctor
may
feel
his
pulse
,
and
that
the
other
may
communicate
to
him
that
piece
of
news
,
which
,
have
Jones
be
apprize
of
it
,
<EOS>
would
have
have
great
difficulty
of
find
its
way
to
Mr
Allworthy
's
ear
at
such
a
season
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
first
hear
Blifil
tell
his
uncle
this
story
,
Jones
could
hardly
contain
the
wrath
which
kindle
in
him
at
the
other
's
indiscretion
,
especially
as
the
doctor
shake
his
head
,
and
declare
his
unwillingness
to
have
the
matter
mention
to
his
patient
.
<EOS>
but
as
his
passion
do
not
so
far
deprive
him
of
all
use
of
his
understanding
,
as
to
hide
from
him
the
consequence
which
any
violent
expression
towards
Blifil
may
have
on
the
sick
,
this
apprehension
still
his
rage
at
the
present
;
and
he
grow
afterwards
so
satisfied
with
find
<EOS>
that
this
news
have
,
in
fact
,
produce
no
mischief
,
that
he
suffer
his
anger
to
die
in
his
own
bosom
,
without
ever
mention
it
to
Blifil
.
  
<EOS>
the
physician
dine
that
day
at
Mr
Allworthy
's
;
and
have
after
dinner
visit
his
patient
,
he
return
to
the
company
,
and
tell
them
,
that
he
have
now
the
satisfaction
to
say
,
with
assurance
,
that
his
patient
be
out
of
all
danger
:
that
he
have
bring
his
fever
to
a
perfect
intermission
,
and
doubt
not
by
throw
in
the
bark
to
prevent
its
return
.
  
<EOS>
this
account
so
pleased
Jones
,
and
throw
him
into
such
immoderate
excess
of
rapture
,
that
he
may
be
truly
say
to
be
drunk
with
joy
 
<EOS>
an
intoxication
which
greatly
forward
the
effect
of
wine
;
<EOS>
and
as
he
be
very
free
too
with
the
bottle
on
this
occasion
(
for
he
drink
many
bumper
to
the
doctor
's
health
,
as
well
as
to
other
toast
)
<EOS>
he
become
very
soon
literally
drunk
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
have
naturally
violent
animal
spirit
:
these
be
set
on
float
and
augment
by
the
spirit
of
wine
,
produce
most
extravagant
effect
.
<EOS>
He
kiss
the
doctor
,
and
embrace
him
with
the
most
passionate
endearment
;
swear
that
next
to
Mr
Allworthy
himself
,
he
love
him
of
all
man
live
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
doctor
,
"
add
he
,
"
you
deserve
a
statue
to
be
erect
to
you

be
not

a
blessing

the

an
honour

perhaps
it
may
have
be
well
for
some
folk
that
he
have
not

to
see
just
reason
of
revoke
his

Jones
now
look
on
Thwackum
with
inconceivable
disdain

answer
,
"
and
doth
thy
mean
soul
imagine
that
any
such
consideration
could
weigh
with

<EOS>
no

let
the
earth
open
and
swallow
her
own
dirt
(
if
I
have
million

what

"
<EOS>
the
word
desiderium
here
can
not
be
easily
translate
.
  
<EOS>
It
include
our
desire
of
enjoy
our

again
,
and
the
grief
  
which
attend
that
desire
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
now
interpose
,
and
prevent
the
effect
of
a
wrath
which
be
kindle
between
Jones
and
Thwackum
;
after
which
the
former
give
a
loose
to
mirth
,
sing
two
or
three
amorous
song
,
and
fall
into
every
frantic
disorder
which
unbridled
joy
be
apt
to
inspire
;
but
so
far
be
he
from
any
disposition
to
quarrel
,
<EOS>
that
he
be
ten
time
better
humour
,
if
possible
,
than
when
he
be
sober
.
  
<EOS>
to
say
truth
,
nothing
be
more
erroneous
than
the
common
observation
,
that
man
who
be
ill
-
natured
and
quarrelsome
when
they
be
drunk
,
be
very
worthy
person
when
they
be
sober
:
for
drink
,
in
reality
,
doth
not
reverse
nature
,
or
create
passion
in
man
which
do
not
exist
in
them
before
.
<EOS>
It
take
away
the
guard
of
reason
,
and
consequently
force
us
to
produce
those
symptom
,
which
many
,
when
sober
,
have
art
enough
to
conceal
.
<EOS>
It
heighten
and
inflame
our
passion
(
generally
indeed
that
passion
which
be
uppermost
in
our
mind
)
,
so
that
the
angry
temper
,
the
amorous
,
the
generous
,
the
good
-
humour
,
the
avaricious
,
and
all
other
disposition
of
man
,
be
in
their
cup
heighten
and
expose
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
as
no
nation
produce
so
many
drunken
quarrel
,
especially
among
the
low
people
,
as
England
(
for
indeed
,
with
them
,
to
drink
and
to
fight
together
be
almost
synonymous
term
)
,
<EOS>
I
would
not
,
methink
,
have
it
thence
conclude
,
that
the
English
be
the
worst
-
natured
people
alive
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
love
of
glory
only
be
at
the
bottom
of
this
;
so
that
the
fair
conclusion
seem
to
be
,
that
our
countryman
have
more
of
that
love
,
and
more
of
bravery
,
than
any
other
plebeian
.
<EOS>
and
this
the
rather
,
as
there
be
seldom
anything
ungenerous
,
unfair
,
or
ill
-
natured
,
exercise
on
these
occasion
:
<EOS>
nay
,
it
be
common
for
the
combatant
to
express
good
-
will
for
each
other
even
at
the
time
of
the
conflict
;
and
as
their
drunken
mirth
generally
end
in
a
battle
,
so
do
most
of
their
battle
end
in
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
our
history
.
<EOS>
though
Jones
have
show
no
design
of
give
offence
,
yet
Mr
Blifil
be
highly
offend
at
a
behaviour
which
be
so
inconsistent
with
the
sober
and
prudent
reserve
of
his
own
temper
.
<EOS>
He
bear
it
too
with
the
great
impatience
,
as
it
appear
to
him
very
indecent
at
this
season
;
"
when
,
"
as
he
say
,
"
the
house
be
a
house
of
mourning
,
on
the
account
of
his
dear
mother
;
and
if
it
have
please
Heaven
to
give
him
some
prospect
of
Mr
Allworthy
's
recovery
,
it
would
become
them
well
to
express
the
exultation
of
their
heart
in
thanksgiving
,
than
in
drunkenness
and
riot
;
which
be
properer
method
to
encrease
the
Divine
wrath
,
than
to
avert
it
.

<EOS>
Thwackum
,
who
have
swallow
more
liquor
than
Jones
,
but
without
any
ill
effect
on
his
brain
,
second
the
pious
harangue
of
Blifil
;
but
Square
,
for
reason
which
the
reader
may
probably
guess
,
be
totally

grave

the

leave

the
two
young

both
of

the

declare

show
the
truth
of
many
observation
of
Ovid

of

more
grave

that

Jones
retire
from

in

engage

into

field

where
he
intend
to
cool
himself
by
a
walk
in
the
open
air
before
he
attend
Mr

<EOS>
there
,
whilst

renew

meditation
on

which
the
dangerous
illness
of

for
some
time
interrupt

an
accident
happen

which
with
sorrow
we
relate

with
sorrow
doubtless
will
it
be
read

however
,
that
historic
truth
to
which
we
profess
so
inviolable

oblige
us
to
communicate
it
to

<EOS>
It
be
now
a
pleasant
evening
in
the
latter
end
of
June
,
when
our
heroe
be
walk
in
a
most
delicious
grove
,
where
the
gentle
breeze
fan
the
leave
,
together
with
the
sweet
trilling
of
a
murmur
stream
,
and
the
melodious
note
of
nightingale

form
altogether
the
most
enchanting
harmony

<EOS>
in
this
scene

so
sweetly
accommodate

meditate
on
his

Sophia

<EOS>
while
his
wanton
fancy
roam
unbounded
over
all
her
beauty
,
and
his
lively
imagination
paint
the
charming

in
various
ravish
form

his
warm
heart
melt
with
tenderness
;
and
at
length
,
throw
himself
on
the
ground
,
by
the
side
of
a
gently
murmur
brook

he
break
forth
into
the
follow
ejaculation
:
  
"
o
Sophia
,
would
Heaven
give
thee
to
my

how
bl
would

Curst
be

set
a

thee

one

thy
whole

be

a

whom
I
would
envy

<EOS>
how
contemptible
would
the
bright
circassian
beauty
,
dr
in
all
the
jewel
of
the
Indies
,
appear
to
my
eye
!
<EOS>
but
why
do
I
mention
another
woman
?
<EOS>
Could
I
think
my
eye
capable
of
look
at
any
other
with
tenderness
,
these
hand
should
tear
them
from
my
head

<EOS>
no

my

if
cruel
fortune
separate
us
for
ever
,
my
soul
shall
doat
on
thee
alone
.
<EOS>
the
chaste
constancy
will
I
ever
preserve
to
thy
image
.
<EOS>
though
I
should
never
have
possession
of
thy
charming

still
shalt
thou
alone
have
possession
of
my

,
my
love
,
my
soul

<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
my
fond
heart
be
so
wrapt
in
that
tender
bosom
,
that
the
bright
beauty
would
for
me
have
no
charm
,
nor
would
a
hermit
be
cold
in
their
embrace
.
<EOS>
Sophia
,
Sophia
alone
shall
be
mine
.
<EOS>
what
rapture
be
in
that
name
!
<EOS>
I
will
engrave
it
on
every
tree
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
at
these
word
he
start
up
,
and
beheld
 
not
his
Sophia
 
no
,
nor
a
Circassian
maid
richly
and
elegantly
attire
for
the
grand
Signior
's
seraglio
.
<EOS>
no
;
without
a
gown
,
in
a
shift
that
be
somewhat
of
the
coarsest
,
and
none
of
the
clean
,
bedew
likewise
with
some
odoriferous
effluvium
,
the
produce
of
the
day
's
labour
,
with
a
pitchfork
in
her
hand
,
Molly

approach

<EOS>
Our

have
his
penknife
in
his

,
which
he
have
draw
for

when
the

come

cry
out
with

smile
,
<EOS>
"
You

not

kill

I
hope

"
 
<EOS>
"
why
should
you
think
I

"
answer
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
reply
she
,
"
after
your
cruel
usage
of
me
when
I
see
you
last
,
kill
me
<EOS>
would
,
perhaps
,
be
too
great
kindness
for
me
to
expect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
ensue
a
parley
,
which
,
as
I
do
not
think
myself
oblige
to
relate
it
,
I
shall
omit
.
<EOS>
It
be
sufficient
that
it
last
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
,
at
the
conclusion
of
which
they
retire
into
the
thick
part
of
the
grove
.
  
<EOS>
some
of
my
reader
may
be
incline
to
think
this
event
unnatural
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
fact
be
true
;
and
perhaps
may
be
sufficiently
account
for
by
suggest
,
that
Jones
probably
think
one
woman
well
than
none
,
and
Molly
as
probably
imagine
two
man
to
be
well
than
one
.
<EOS>
besides
the
before
-
mention
motive
assign
to
the
present
behaviour
of
Jones
,
the
reader
will
be
likewise
pleased
to
recollect
in
his
favour
,
that
he
be
not
at
this
time
perfect
master
of
that
wonderful
power
of
reason
,
which
so
well
enable
grave
and
wise
man
to
subdue
their
unruly
passion
,
and
to
decline
any
of
these
prohibit
amusement
.
<EOS>
Wine
now
have
totally
subdue
this
power
in
Jones
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
indeed
,
in
a
condition
,
in
which
,
if
reason
have
interpose
,
though
only
to
advise
,
she
may
have
receive
the
answer
which
one
Cleostratus
give
many
year
ago
to
a
silly
fellow
,
who
ask
him
,
if
he
be
not
ashamed
to
be
drunk
?
"
<EOS>
be
not
you
,
"
say
Cleostratus
,
"
ashamed
to
admonish
a
drunken
man
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
in
a
court
of
justice
drunkenness
must
not
be
an
excuse
,
yet
in
a
court
of
conscience
it
be
greatly
so
;
and
therefore
Aristotle
,
who
commend
the
law
of
pittacus
,
by
which
drunken
man
receive
double
punishment
for
their
crime
,
allow
there
be
more
of
policy
than
justice
in
that
law
.
<EOS>
now
,
if
there
be
any
transgression
pardonable
from
drunkenness
,
they
be
certainly
such
as
Mr
Jones
be
at
present
guilty
of
;
on
which
head
I
could
pour
forth
a
vast
profusion
of
learning
,
if
I
imagine
it
would
either
entertain
my
reader
,
or
teach
him
anything
more
than
he
know
already
.
<EOS>
for
his
sake
therefore
I
shall
keep
my
learning
to
myself
,
and
return
to
my
history
.
  
<EOS>
It
hath
be
observe
,
that
Fortune
seldom
doth

by
half

<EOS>
to
say
truth

there
be
no
end
to
her
freak

she

dispose
to
gratify

Blifil
know
Jones

not

He
start

utter
a

solemn
ejaculation

Thwackum
express
some
surprize
at
these
sudden

ask
the
reason

to
which
Blifil
answer

"
He

which

some
wicked
purpose

"
<EOS>
as
to
the
name
of
Jones
,
he
think
proper
to
conceal
it
,
and
why
he
do
so
must
be
leave
to
the
judgment
of
the
sagacious
reader
;
for
we
never
chuse

assign

Mr

to
conduct
him
immediately
to

as
he
approach
he
breathe
forth
vengeance
mix
with
lamentation

nor
do
he
refrain
from
cast
some
oblique
reflection
on
Mr

insinuate
that
the
wickedness
of

to
the
encouragement
he
have
give
to

by

by
have
mitigate

wholesome
rigour

severe

the

him

nay

Thwackum

<EOS>
such
vengeance
do

to
thunder
forth
,
"
fie

<EOS>
fie
upon
it
!
<EOS>
Mr
Jones
.
<EOS>
be
it
possible
you
should
be
the
person
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
answer
Jones
,
"
it
be
possible
I
should
be
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
who
,
"
say
Thwackum
,
"
be
that
wicked
slut
with
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
I
have
any
wicked
slut
with
me
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
it
be
possible
I
shall
not
let
you
know
who
she
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
command
you
to
tell
me
immediately
,
"
say
Thwackum
:
"
and
I
would
not
have
you
imagine
<EOS>
,
young
man
,
that
your
age
,
though
it
hath
somewhat
abridge
the
purpose
of
tuition
,
hath
totally
take
away
the
authority
of
the
master
.
<EOS>
the
relation
of
the
master
and
scholar
be
indelible
;
as
,
indeed
,
all
other
relation
be
;
for
they
all
derive
their
original
from
heaven
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
you
think
yourself
,
therefore
,
as
much
oblige
to
obey
me
now
,
as
when
I
teach
you
your
first
rudiment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
would
,
"
cry
Jones
;
"
but
that
will
not
happen
,
unless
you
have
the
same
birchen
argument
to
convince
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
I
must
tell
you
plainly
,
"
say
Thwackum
,
"
I
be
resolve
to
discover
the
wicked
wretch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
I
must
tell
you
plainly
,
"
return
Jones
,
"
<EOS>
I
be
resolve
you
shall
not
.
"
<EOS>
Thwackum
then
offer
to
advance
,
and
Jones
lay
hold
of
his
arm
;
which
Mr
Blifil
endeavour
to
rescue
,
declare
,
"
he
would
not
see
his
old
master
insult
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
now
find
himself
engage
with
two
,
think
it
necessary
to
rid
himself
of
one
of
his
antagonist
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
apply
to
the
weak
first
;
and
,
let
the
parson
go
,
he
direct
a
blow
at
the
young
squire
's
breast
,
which
luckily
take
place
,
reduce
him
to
measure
his
length
on
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
Thwackum
be
so
intent
on
the
discovery
,
that
,
the
moment
he
find
himself
at
liberty
,
he
stept
forward
directly
into
the
fern
,
without
any
great
consideration
of
what
may
in
the
meantime
befal
his
friend
;
but
he
have
advance
a
very
few
pace
into
the
thicket
,
before
Jones
,
have
defeat
Blifil
,
overtook
the
parson
,
and
drag
him
backward
by
the
skirt
of
his
coat
.
  
<EOS>
this
parson
have
be
a
champion
in
his
youth
,
and
have
win
much
honour
by
his
fist
,
both
at
school
and
at
the
university
.
<EOS>
He
have
now
indeed
,
for
a
great
number
of
year
,
decline
the
practice
of
that
noble
art
;
yet
be
his
courage
full
as
strong
as
his
faith
,
and
his
body
no
less
strong
than
either
.
<EOS>
He
be
moreover
,
as
the
reader
may
perhaps
have
conceive
,
somewhat
irascible
in
his
nature
.
<EOS>
when
he
look
back
,
therefore
,
and
see
his
friend
stretch
out
on
the
ground
,
and
find
himself
at
the
same
time
so
roughly
handle
by
one
who
have
formerly
be
only
passive
in
all
conflict
between
them
(
a
circumstance
which
highly
aggravate
the
whole
)
,
his
patience
at
length
give
way
;
he
throw
himself
into
a
posture
of
offence
;
and
collect
all
his
force
,
attack
Jones
in
the
front
with
as
much
impetuosity
as
he
have
formerly
attack
him
in
the
rear
.
  
<EOS>
Our
heroe
receive
the
enemy
's
attack
with
the
most
undaunted
intrepidity
,
and
his
bosom
resound
with
the
blow
.
<EOS>
this
he
presently
return
with
no
less
violence
,
aim
likewise
at
the
parson
's
breast
;
but
he
dexterously
drive
down
the
fist
of
Jones
,
so
that
it
reach
only
his
belly
,
where
two
pound
of
beef
and
as
many
of
pudde
be
then
deposit
,
and
whence
consequently
no
hollow
sound
could
proceed
.
<EOS>
many
lusty
blow
,
much
more
pleasant
as
well
as
easy
to
have
see
,
than
to
read
or
describe
,
be
give
on
both
side
:
at
last
a
violent
fall
,
in
which
Jones
have
throw
his
knee
into
Thwackum
's
breast
,
so
weaken
the
latter
,
<EOS>
that
victory
have
be
no
longer
dubious
,
have
not
Blifil
,
who
have
now
recover
his
strength
,
again
renew
the
fight
,
and
by
engage
with
Jones
,
give
the
parson
a
moment
's
time
to
shake
his
ear
,
and
to
regain
his
breath
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
both
together
attack
our
heroe
,
whose
blow
do
not
retain
that
force
with
which
they
have
fall
at
first
,
<EOS>
so
weakened
be
he
by
his
combat
with
Thwackum
;
for
though
the
pedagogue
choose
rather
to
play
solo
on
the
human
instrument
,
and
have
be
lately
use
to
those
only
,
yet
he
still
retain
enough
of
his
antient
knowledge
to
perform
his
part
very
well
in
a
duet
.
  
<EOS>
the
victory
,
accord
to
modern
custom
,
be
like
to
be
decide
by
number
,
when
,
on
a
sudden
,
a
fourth
pair
of
fist
appear
in
the
battle
,
and
immediately
pay
their
compliment
to
the
parson
;
and
the
owner
of
them
at
the
same
time
cry
out
,
"
be
not
you
ashamed
,
and
be
d####n'd
to
you
,
to
fall
two
of
you
upon
one
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
battle
,
which
be
of
the
kind
that
for
distinction
's
sake
be
call
royal
,
now
rage
with
the
utmost
violence
during
a
few
minute
;
till
Blifil
be
a
second
time
lay
sprawling
by
Jones
,
Thwackum
condescend
to
apply
for
quarter
to
his
new
antagonist
,
who
be
now
find
to
be
Mr
Western
himself
;
for
in
the
heat
of
the
action
none
of
the
combatant
have
recognize
him
.
  
<EOS>
in
fact
,
that
honest
squire
,
happen
,
in
his
afternoon
's
walk
with
some
company
,
to
pass
through
the
field
where
the
bloody
battle
be
fight
,
and
have
conclude
,
from
see
three
man
engage
,
that
two
of
them
must
be
on
a
side
,
he
hasten
from
his
companion
,
and
with
more
gallantry
than
policy
,
espouse
the
cause
of
the
weak
party
.
<EOS>
by
which
generous
proceeding
he
very
probably
prevent
Mr
Jones
from
become
a
victim
to
the
wrath
of
Thwackum
,
and
to
the
pious
friendship
which
Blifil
bear
his
old
master
;
for
,
besides
the
disadvantage
of
such
odd
,
Jones
have
not
yet
sufficiently
recover
the
former
strength
of
his
broken
arm
.
<EOS>
this
reinforcement
,
however
,
soon
put
an
end
to
the
action
,
and
Jones
with
his
ally
obtain
the
victory
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
be
see
a
more
moving
spectacle
than
all
the
blood
in
the
body
of
Thwackum
and
Blifil
,
and
of
twenty
other
such
,
be
capable
of
produce
.
 
<EOS>
the
rest
of
Mr
Western
's
company
be
now
come
up
,
be
just
at
the
instant
when
the
action
be
over
.
<EOS>
these
be
the
honest
clergyman
,
whom
we
have
formerly
see
at
Mr
Western
's
table
;
Mrs
Western
,
the
aunt
of
Sophia
;
and
lastly
,
the
lovely
Sophia
herself
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
time
,
the
follow
be
the
aspect
of
the
bloody
field
.
<EOS>
in
one
place
lie
on
the
ground
,
all
pale
,
and
almost
breathless
,
the
vanquish
Blifil
.
<EOS>
near
him
stand
the
conqueror
Jones
,
almost
cover
with
blood
,
part
of
which
be
naturally
his
own
,
and
part
have
be
lately
the
property
of
the
Reverend
Mr
Thwackum
.
<EOS>
in
a
third
place
stand
the
say
Thwackum
,
like
King
Porus
,
sullenly
submit
to
the
conqueror
.
<EOS>
the
last
figure
in
the
piece
be
western
<EOS>
the
great
,
most
gloriously
forbear
the
vanquish
foe
.
  
<EOS>
Blifil
,
in
whom
there
be
little
sign
of
life
,
be
at
first
the
principal
object
of
the
concern
of
every
one
,
and
particularly
of
Mrs
Western
,
who
have
draw
from
her
pocket
a
bottle
of
hartshorn
,
and
be
herself
about
to
apply
it
to
his
nostril
,
when
on
a
sudden
the
attention
of
the
whole
company
be
divert
from
poor
Blifil
,
whose
spirit
,
if
it
have
any
such
design
,
may
have
now
take
an
opportunity
of
steal
off
to
the
other
world
,
without
any
ceremony
.
  
<EOS>
for
now
a
more
melancholy
and
a
more
lovely
object
lie
motionless
before
them
.
<EOS>
this
be
no
other
than
the
charming
Sophia
herself
,
who
,
from
the
sight
of
blood
,
or
from
fear
for
her
father
,
or
from
some
other
reason
,
have
fall
down
in
a
swoon
,
before
any
one
could
get
to
her
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Western
first
see
her
and
scream
.
<EOS>
immediately
two
or
three
voice
cry
out
,
"
Miss
Western
be
dead
.
"
<EOS>
hartshorn
,
water
,
every
remedy
be
call
for
,
almost
at
one
and
the
same
instant
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
may
remember
,
that
in
our
description
of
this
grove
we
mention
a
murmuring
brook
,
which
brook
do
not
come
there
,
as
such
gentle
stream
flow
through
vulgar
romance
,
with
no
other
purpose
than
to
murmur
.
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
Fortune
have
decree
to
ennoble
this
little
brook
with
a
high
honour
than
any
of
those
which
wash
the
plain
of
Arcadia
ever
deserve
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
be
rub
Blifil
's
temple
,
for
he
begin
to
fear
he
have
give
him
a
blow
too
much
,
when
the
word
,
Miss
Western
and
Dead
,
rush
at
once
on
his
ear
.
<EOS>
He
start
up
,
leave
Blifil
to
his
fate
,
and
fly
to
Sophia
,
whom
,
while
all
the
rest
be
run
against
each
other
,
backward
and
forward
,
look
for
water
in
the
dry
path
,
he
catch
up
in
his
arm
,
and
then
run
away
with
her
over
the
field
to
the
rivulet
above
mention
;
where
,
plunge
himself
into
the
water
,
he
contrive
to
besprinkle
her
face
,
head
,
and
neck
very
plentifully
.
  
<EOS>
Happy
be
it
for
Sophia
that
the
same
confusion
which
prevent
her
other
friend
from
serve
her
,
prevent
them
likewise
from
obstruct
Jones
.
<EOS>
He
have
carry
her
half
way
before
they
know
what
he
be
do
,
and
he
have
actually
restore
her
to
life
before
they
reach
the
waterside
.
<EOS>
She
stretch
out
her
arm
,
open
her
eye
,
and
cry
,
"
oh
!
heavens
!
"
just
as
her
father
,
aunt
,
and
the
parson
come
up
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
,
who
have
hitherto
hold
this
lovely
burthen
in
his
arm
,
now
relinquish
his
hold
;
but
give
her
at
the
same
instant
a
tender
caress
,
which
,
have
her
sense
be
then
perfectly
restore
,
could
not
have
escape
her
observation
.
<EOS>
as
she
express
,
therefore
,
no
displeasure
at
this
freedom
<EOS>
,
we
suppose
she
be
not
sufficiently
recover
from
her
swoon
at
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
this
tragical
scene
be
now
convert
into
a
sudden
scene
of
joy
.
<EOS>
in
this
our
heroe
be
certainly
the
principal
character
;
for
as
he
probably
feel
more
ecstatic
delight
in
have
save
Sophia
than
she
herself
receive
from
be
save
,
so
neither
be
the
congratulation
pay
to
her
equal
to
what
be
confer
on
Jones
,
especially
by
Mr
Western
himself
,
who
,
after
have
once
or
twice
embrace
his
daughter
,
fall
to
hugging
and
kiss
Jones
.
<EOS>
He
call
him
the
preserver
of
Sophia
,
and
declare
there
be
nothing
,
except
her
,
or
his
estate
,
which
he
would
not
give
him
;
but
upon
recollection
,
he
afterwards
except
his
fox
-
hound
,
the
Chevalier
,
and
Miss
Slouch
(
for
so
he
call
his
favourite
mare
)
.
  
<EOS>
all
fear
for
Sophia
be
now
remove
<EOS>
,
Jones
become
the
object
of
the
squire
's
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
,
my
lad
,
"
say
Western
,
"
d'off
thy
quoat
and
wash
thy
feace
;
for
att
in
a
devilish
pickle
,
I
promise
thee
.
<EOS>
come
,
come
,
wash
thyself
,
and
shat
go
huome
with
me
;
and
we'l
zee
to
vind
thee
another
quoat
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
immediately
comply
,
throw
off
his
coat
,
go
down
to
the
water
,
and
wash
both
his
face
and
bosom
;
for
the
latter
be
as
much
expose
and
as
bloody
as
the
former
.
<EOS>
but
though
the
water
could
clear
off
the
blood
,
it
could
not
remove
the
black
and
blue
mark
which
Thwackum
have
imprint
on
both
his
face
and
breast
,
and
which
,
be
discern
by
Sophia
,
draw
from
her
a
sigh
and
a
look
full
of
inexpressible
tenderness
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
receive
this
full
in
his
eye
,
and
it
have
infinitely
a
strong
effect
on
him
than
all
the
contusion
which
he
have
receive
before
.
<EOS>
an
effect
,
however
,
widely
different
;
for
so
soft
and
balmy
be
it
,
that
,
have
all
his
former
blow
be
stab
,
it
would
for
some
minute
have
prevent
his
feel
their
smart
.
  
<EOS>
the
company
now
move
backwards
,
and
soon
arrive
where
Thwackum
have
get
Mr
Blifil
again
on
his
leg
.
<EOS>
here
we
can
not
suppress
a
pious
wish
,
that
all
quarrel
be
to
be
decide
by
those
weapon
only
with
which
Nature
,
know
what
be
proper
for
us
,
hath
supply
us
;
and
that
cold
iron
be
to
be
use
in
dig
no
bowel
but
those
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
then
would
war
,
the
pastime
of
monarchs
,
be
almost
inoffensive
,
and
battle
between
great
army
may
be
fight
at
the
particular
desire
of
several
lady
of
quality
;
who
,
together
with
the
king
themselves
,
may
be
actual
spectator
of
the
conflict
.
<EOS>
then
may
the
field
be
this
moment
well
strew
with
human
carcass
,
and
the
next
,
the
dead
man
,
or
infinitely
the
great
part
of
them
,
may
get
up
,
like
Mr
Bayes
's
troop
,
and
march
off
either
at
the
sound
of
a
drum
or
fiddle
,
as
should
be
previously
agree
on
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
avoid
,
if
possible
,
treat
this
matter
ludicrously
,
lest
grave
man
and
politician
,
whom
I
know
to
be
offend
at
a
jest
,
may
cry
pish
at
it
;
but
,
in
reality
,
may
not
a
battle
be
as
well
decide
by
the
great
number
of
broken
head
,
bloody
nose
,
and
black
eye
,
as
by
the
great
heap
of
mangle
and
murder
human
body
?
<EOS>
may
not
town
be
contend
for
in
the
same
manner
?
<EOS>
indeed
,
this
may
be
think
too
detrimental
a
scheme
to
the
french
interest
,
since
they
would
thus
lose
the
advantage
they
have
over
other
nation
in
the
superiority
of
their
engineer
;
but
when
I
consider
the
gallantry
and
generosity
of
that
people
,
I
be
persuade
they
would
never
decline
put
themselves
upon
a
par
with
their
adversary
;
or
,
as
the
phrase
be
,
make
themselves
his
match
.
  
<EOS>
but
such
reformation
be
rather
to
be
wish
than
hope
for
<EOS>
:
I
shall
content
myself
,
therefore
,
with
this
short
hint
,
and
return
to
my
narrative
.
  
<EOS>
Western
begin
now
to
inquire
into
the
original
rise
of
this
quarrel
.
<EOS>
to
which
neither
Blifil
nor
Jones
give
any
answer
;
but
Thwackum
say
surlily
,
"
I
believe
the
cause
be
not
far
off
;
if
you
beat
the
bush
<EOS>
well
you
may
find
her
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
find
her
?
"
<EOS>
reply
western
:
"
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
have
you
be
fight
for
a
wench
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ask
the
gentleman
in
his
waistcoat
there
,
"
say
Thwackum
:
"
he
best
know
.
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
then
,
"
cry
Western
,
"
it
be
a
wench
certainly
.
 
<EOS>
ah
,
Tom
,
Tom
,
thou
art
a
liquorish
dog
.
<EOS>
but
come
,
gentleman
,
be
all
friend
,
and
go
home
with
me
,
and
make
final
peace
over
a
bottle
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
ask
your
pardon
,
sir
,
"
say
Thwackum
:
"
it
be
no
such
slight
matter
for
a
man
of
my
character
to
be
thus
injuriously
treat
,
and
buffet
by
a
boy
,
only
because
I
would
have
do
my
duty
,
in
endeavour
to
detect
and
bring
to
justice
a
wanton
harlot
;
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
the
principal
fault
lie
in
Mr
Allworthy
and
yourself
;
for
if
you
put
the
law
in
execution
,
as
you
ought
to
do
,
you
will
soon
rid
the
country
of
these
vermin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
as
soon
rid
the
country
of
fox
,
"
cry
western
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
we
ought
to
encourage
the
recruiting
those
number
which
we
be
every
day
lose
in
the
war
.
 
<EOS>
but
where
be
she
?
<EOS>
Prithee
,
Tom
,
show
me
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
begin
to
beat
about
,
in
the
same
language
and
in
the
same
manner
as
if
he
have
be
beat
for
a
hare
;
and
at
last
cry
out
,
"
Soho
!
<EOS>
Puss
be
not
far
off
.
<EOS>
here
be
her
form
,
upon
my
soul
;
I
believe
I
may
cry
steal
away
.
"
<EOS>
and
indeed
so
he
may
;
for
he
have
now
discover
the
place
whence
the
poor
girl
have
,
at
the
beginning
of
the
fray
,
steal
away
,
upon
as
many
foot
as
a
hare
generally
use
in
travel
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
now
desire
her
father
to
return
home
;
say
she
find
herself
very
faint
,
and
apprehend
a
relapse
.
<EOS>
the
squire
immediately
comply
with
his
daughter
's
request
(
for
he
be
the
fond
of
parent
)
.
<EOS>
He
earnestly
endeavour
to
prevail
with
the
whole
company
to
go
and
sup
with
him
:
but
Blifil
and
Thwackum
absolutely
refuse
;
the
former
saying
,
there
be
more
reason
than
he
could
then
mention
,
why
he
must
decline
this
honour
;
and
the
latter
declaring
(
perhaps
rightly
)
that
it
be
not
proper
for
a
person
of
his
function
to
be
see
at
any
place
in
his
present
condition
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
be
incapable
of
refuse
the
pleasure
of
be
with
his
Sophia
;
so
on
he
march
with
Squire
Western
and
his
lady
,
the
parson
bring
up
the
rear
.
<EOS>
this
have
,
indeed
,
offer
to
tarry
with
his
brother
Thwackum
,
profess
his
regard
for
the
cloth
would
not
permit
him
to
depart
;
but
Thwackum
would
not
accept
the
favour
,
and
,
with
no
great
civility
,
push
him
after
Mr
Western
.
  
<EOS>
thus
end
this
bloody
fray
;
and
thus
shall
end
the
fifth
book
of
this
history
.
  
<EOS>
BOOK
VI
.
  
<EOS>
contain
about
three
WEEKS
.
    
<EOS>
of
love
.
 
<EOS>
in
our
last
book
we
have
be
oblige
to
deal
pretty
much
with
the
passion
of
love
;
and
in
our
succeed
book
shall
be
force
to
handle
this
subject
still
more
largely
.
<EOS>
It
may
not
therefore
in
this
place
be
improper
to
apply
ourselves
to
the
examination
of
that
modern
doctrine
,
by
which
certain
philosopher
,
among
many
other
wonderful
discovery
,
pretend
to
have
find
out
,
that
there
be
no
such
passion
in
the
human
breast
.
  
<EOS>
whether
these
philosopher
be
the
same
with
that
surprising
sect
,
who
be
honourably
mention
by
the
late
Dr
Swift
,
as
have
,
by
the
mere
force
of
genius
alone
,
without
the
least
assistance
of
any
kind
of
learning
,
or
even
read
,
discover
that
profound
and
invaluable
secret
that
there
be
no
God
;
or
whether
they
be
not
rather
the
same
with
those
who
some
year
since
very
much
alarm
the
world
,
by
show
that
there
be
no
such
thing
as
virtue
or
goodness
really
exist
in
human
nature
,
and
who
deduce
our
good
action
from
pride
,
I
will
not
here
presume
to
determine
.
<EOS>
in
reality
,
I
be
incline
to
suspect
,
that
all
these
several
finder
of
truth
,
be
the
very
identical
man
who
be
by
other
call
the
finder
of
gold
.
<EOS>
the
method
use
in
both
these
search
after
truth
and
after
gold
,
be
indeed
one
and
the
same
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
the
search
,
rummage
,
and
examine
into
a
nasty
place
;
indeed
,
in
the
former
instance
,
into
the
nasty
of
all
place
,
a
bad
mind
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
in
this
particular
,
and
perhaps
in
their
success
,
the
truth
-
finder
and
the
gold
-
finder
may
very
properly
be
compare
together
;
yet
in
modesty
,
surely
,
there
can
be
no
comparison
between
the
two
;
for
who
ever
hear
of
a
gold
-
finder
that
have
the
impudence
or
folly
to
assert
,
from
the
ill
success
of
his
search
,
that
there
be
no
such
thing
as
gold
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
whereas
the
truth
-
finder
,
have
rake
out
that
jakes
,
his
own
mind
,
and
be
there
capable
of
trace
no
ray
of
divinity
,
nor
anything
virtuous
or
good
,
or
lovely
,
or
loving
,
very
fairly
,
honestly
,
and
logically
conclude
that
no
such
thing
exist
in
the
whole
creation
.
  
<EOS>
to
avoid
,
however
,
all
contention
,
if
possible
,
with
these
philosopher
,
if
they
will
be
call
so
;
and
to
show
our
own
disposition
to
accommodate
matter
peaceably
between
us
,
we
shall
here
make
them
some
concession
,
which
may
possibly
put
an
end
to
the
dispute
.
  
<EOS>
first
,
we
will
grant
that
many
mind
,
and
perhaps
those
of
the
philosopher
,
be
entirely
free
from
the
least
trace
of
such
a
passion
.
  
<EOS>
secondly
,
that
what
be
commonly
call
love
,
namely
,
the
desire
of
satisfy
a
voracious
appetite
with
a
certain
quantity
of
delicate
white
human
flesh
,
be
by
no
mean
that
passion
for
which
I
here
contend
.
<EOS>
this
be
indeed
more
properly
hunger
;
and
as
no
glutton
be
ashamed
to
apply
the
word
love
to
his
appetite
,
and
to
say
he
love
such
and
such
dish
;
so
may
the
lover
of
this
kind
,
with
equal
propriety
,
say
,
he
HUNGERS
after
such
and
such
woman
.
  
<EOS>
thirdly
,
I
will
grant
,
which
I
believe
will
be
a
most
acceptable
concession
,
that
this
love
for
which
I
be
an
advocate
,
though
it
satisfy
itself
in
a
much
more
delicate
manner
,
doth
nevertheless
seek
its
own
satisfaction
as
much
as
the
gross
of
all
our
appetite
.
  
<EOS>
and
,
lastly
,
that
this
love
,
when
it
operate
towards
one
of
a
different
sex
,
be
very
apt
,
towards
its
complete
gratification
,
to
call
in
the
aid
of
that
hunger
which
I
have
mention
above
;
and
which
it
be
so
far
from
abate
,
that
it
heighten
all
its
delight
to
a
degree
scarce
imaginable
by
those
who
have
never
be
susceptible
of
any
other
emotion
than
what
have
proceed
from
appetite
alone
.
  
<EOS>
in
return
to
all
these
concession
,
I
desire
of
the
philosopher
to
grant
,
that
there
be
in
some
(
I
believe
in
many
)
human
breast
a
kind
and
benevolent
disposition
,
which
be
gratify
by
contribute
to
the
happiness
of
other
.
<EOS>
that
in
this
gratification
alone
,
as
in
friendship
,
in
parental
and
filial
affection
,
as
indeed
in
general
philanthropy
,
there
be
a
great
and
exquisite
delight
.
<EOS>
that
if
we
will
not
call
such
disposition
love
,
we
have
no
name
for
it
.
<EOS>
that
though
the
pleasure
arise
from
such
pure
love
may
be
heighten
and
sweeten
by
the
assistance
of
amorous
desire
,
yet
the
former
can
subsist
alone
,
nor
be
they
destroy
by
the
intervention
of
the
latter
.
<EOS>
lastly
,
that
esteem
and
gratitude
be
the
proper
motive
to
love
,
as
youth
and
beauty
be
to
desire
,
and
,
therefore
,
though
such
desire
may
naturally
cease
,
when
age
or
sickness
overtake
its
object
;
yet
these
can
have
no
effect
on
love
,
nor
ever
shake
or
remove
,
from
a
good
mind
,
that
sensation
or
passion
which
hath
gratitude
and
esteem
for
its
basis
.
  
<EOS>
to
deny
the
existence
of
a
passion
of
which
we
often
see
manifest
instance
,
seem
to
be
very
strange
and
absurd
;
and
can
indeed
proceed
only
from
that
self
-
admonition
which
we
have
mention
above
:
but
how
unfair
be
this
!
<EOS>
doth
the
man
who
recognize
in
his
own
heart
no
trace
of
avarice
or
ambition
,
conclude
,
therefore
,
that
there
be
no
such
passion
in
human
nature
?
<EOS>
why
will
we
not
modestly
observe
the
same
rule
in
judging
of
the
good
,
as
well
as
the
evil
of
other
?
<EOS>
or
why
,
in
any
case
,
will
we
,
as
Shakespear
phrase
it
,
"
put
the
world
in
our
own
person
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
predominant
vanity
be
,
I
be
afraid
,
too
much
concerned
here
.
<EOS>
this
be
one
instance
of
that
adulation
which
we
bestow
on
our
own
mind
,
and
this
almost
universally
.
<EOS>
for
there
be
scarce
any
man
<EOS>
,
how
much
soever
he
may
despise
the
character
of
a
flatterer
,
but
will
condescend
in
the
mean
manner
to
flatter
himself
.
  
<EOS>
to
those
therefore
I
apply
for
the
truth
of
the
above
observation
,
whose
own
mind
can
bear
testimony
to
what
I
have
advance
.
  
<EOS>
examine
your
heart
,
my
good
reader
,
and
resolve
whether
you
do
believe
these
matter
with
me
.
<EOS>
if
you
do
,
you
may
now
proceed
to
their
exemplification
in
the
follow
page
:
<EOS>
if
you
do
not
,
you
have
,
I
assure
you
,
already
read
more
than
you
have
understand
;
and
it
would
be
wise
to
pursue
your
business
,
or
your
pleasure
(
such
as
they
be
)
,
than
to
throw
away
any
more
of
your
time
in
read
what
you
can
neither
taste
nor
comprehend
.
<EOS>
to
treat
of
the
effect
of
love
to
you
,
must
be
as
absurd
as
to
discourse
on
colour
to
a
man
bear
blind
;
since
possibly
your
idea
of
love
may
be
as
absurd
as
that
which
we
be
tell
such
blind
man
once
entertain
of
the
colour
scarlet
;
that
colour
seem
to
him
to
be
very
much
like
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
:
and
love
probably
may
,
in
your
opinion
,
very
greatly
resemble
a
dish
of
soup
,
or
a
surloin
of
roast
-
beef
.
    
<EOS>
the
character
of
Mrs
Western
.
<EOS>
Her
great
learning
and
knowledge
of
the
world
,
and
an
instance
of
the
deep
penetration
which
she
derive
from
those
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
the
reader
hath
see
Mr
Western
,
his
sister
,
and
daughter
,
with
young
Jones
,
and
the
parson
,
go
together
to
Mr
Western
's
house
,
where
the
great
part
of
the
company
spend
the
evening
with
much
joy
and
festivity
.
<EOS>
Sophia
be
indeed
the
only
grave
person
;
for
as
to
Jones
,
though
love
have
now
get
entire
possession
of
his
heart
,
yet
the
pleasing
reflection
on
Mr
Allworthy
's
recovery
,
and
the
presence
of
his
mistress
,
join
to
some
tender
look
which
<EOS>
she
now
<EOS>
and
then
could
not
refrain
from
give
him
,
so
elevate
our
heroe
,
that
he
join
the
mirth
of
the
other
three
,
who
be
perhaps
as
good
-
humoured
people
as
any
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
retain
the
same
gravity
of
countenance
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
;
whence
she
retire
likewise
earlier
than
usual
,
leave
her
father
and
aunt
together
.
<EOS>
the
squire
take
no
notice
of
this
change
in
his
daughter
's
disposition
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
though
he
be
somewhat
of
a
politician
,
and
have
be
twice
a
candidate
in
the
country
interest
at
an
election
,
he
be
a
man
of
no
great
observation
.
<EOS>
His
sister
be
a
lady
of
a
different
turn
.
<EOS>
She
have
live
about
the
court
,
and
have
see
the
world
.
<EOS>
hence
she
have
acquire
all
that
knowledge
which
the
say
world
usually
communicate
;
and
be
a
perfect
mistress
of
manner
,
custom
,
ceremony
,
and
fashion
.
<EOS>
nor
do
her
erudition
stop
here
.
<EOS>
She
have
considerably
improve
her
mind
by
study
;
she
have
not
only
read
all
the
modern
play
,
opera
,
oratorio
,
poem
,
and
romance
 
in
all
which
she
be
a
critic
;
but
have
go
through
Rapin
's
history
of
England
,
Eachard
's
Roman
history
,
and
many
French
Memoires
pour
servir
a
l'Histoire
:
to
these
she
have
add
most
of
the
political
pamphlet
and
journal
publish
within
the
last
twenty
year
.
<EOS>
from
which
she
have
attain
a
very
competent
skill
in
politic
,
and
could
discourse
very
learnedly
on
the
affair
of
Europe
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
moreover
,
excellently
well
skilled
in
the
doctrine
of
amour
,
and
know
better
than
anybody
who
and
who
be
together
;
a
knowledge
which
she
the
more
easily
attain
,
as
her
pursuit
of
it
be
never
divert
by
any
affair
of
her
own
;
for
either
she
have
no
inclination
,
or
they
have
never
be
solicit
;
which
last
be
indeed
very
probable
;
for
her
masculine
person
,
which
be
near
six
foot
high
,
add
to
her
manner
and
learning
,
possibly
prevent
the
other
sex
from
regard
her
,
notwithstanding
her
petticoat
,
in
the
light
of
a
woman
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
she
have
consider
the
matter
scientifically
,
she
perfectly
well
know
,
though
she
have
never
practise
them
,
all
the
art
which
fine
lady
use
when
they
desire
to
give
encouragement
,
or
to
conceal
liking
,
with
all
the
long
appendage
of
smile
,
ogle
,
glance
,
&
c.
,
as
they
be
at
present
practise
in
the
beau
-
monde
.
<EOS>
to
sum
the
whole
,
no
species
of
disguise
or
affectation
have
escape
her
notice
;
but
as
to
the
plain
simple
working
of
honest
nature
,
as
she
have
never
see
any
such
,
she
could
know
but
little
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
by
mean
of
this
wonderful
sagacity
,
Mrs
Western
have
now
,
as
she
think
,
make
a
discovery
of
something
in
the
mind
of
Sophia
.
<EOS>
the
first
hint
of
this
she
take
from
the
behaviour
of
the
young
lady
in
the
field
of
battle
;
and
the
suspicion
which
she
then
conceive
,
be
greatly
corroborate
by
some
observation
which
she
have
make
that
evening
and
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
however
,
be
greatly
cautious
to
avoid
be
find
in
a
mistake
,
she
carry
the
secret
a
whole
fortnight
in
her
bosom
,
give
only
some
oblique
hint
,
by
simper
,
winks
,
nod
,
and
now
and
then
drop
an
obscure
word
,
which
indeed
sufficiently
alarm
Sophia
,
but
do
not
at
all
affect
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
be
at
length
,
however
,
thoroughly
satisfied
of
the
truth
of
her
observation
,
she
take
an
opportunity
,
one
morning
,
when
she
be
alone
with
her
brother
,
to
interrupt
one
of
his
whistle
in
the
follow
manner
:
    
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
brother
,
have
you
not
observe
something
very
extraordinary
in
my
niece
lately
?
"
 
<EOS>

answer
western
;
"
be
anything
the
matter
with
the
girl
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
there
be
,
"
reply
she
;
"
and
something
of
much
consequence
too
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
she
doth
not
complain
of
anything
,

she
hath

"
<EOS>
here

her
with
much
earnestness

and
beg
her

<EOS>
"
Nay

not
so
terrible

Mrs

You

I

I

else
I
ought

<EOS>
there
 
I
have
make
a
shift

it
down

what

what

should
be
the

all
her
melancholy
that
night
at

the

Fore

<EOS>
"
now
you

,
I
remember
it
all

<EOS>
It
be
certainly
so
,

I
be
glad
on't
with
all
my
heart

<EOS>
I
know
Sophy
be
a
good
girl
,
and
would
not
fall
in

to
make
me
angry

<EOS>
I
be
never
more
rejoice
in
my

;
for
nothing
can
lie
so
handy
together
as
our
two
estate

<EOS>
I
have
this
matter
in
my
head
some
time
ago
:
for
certainly
the
two
estate
be
in
a
manner
join
together
in
matrimony
already
,
and
it
would
be
a
thousand
pity
to
part
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
indeed
,
there
be
large
estate
in
the
kingdom
,
but
not
in
this
county
,
and
I
have
rather
bate
something
,
than
marry
my
daughter

stranger

foreigner

most
o

great
estate

in
the
hand

I
heate
the
very
name

<EOS>
well
but
,
sister
,
what
would
you
advise
me
to
do
;
for
I
tell
you
woman
know
these
matter
better
than
we
do

<EOS>
"
oh
,
your

"
answer
the

"
we
be
oblige

you

allow
us
a

since
you
be
pleased

then
,
most
politic
sir

to
ask
my
advice

I
think
you
may
propose
the
match
to
Allworthy
yourself

<EOS>
there
be
no
indecorum
in
the
proposal

come
from
the
parent
of
either
side

<EOS>
King
Alcinous
,
in
Mr

his
daughter
to
Ulysses

<EOS>
I
need
not
caution
so
politic
a
person
not
to
say
that
your
daughter
be
in
love
;
that
would
indeed
be
against
all
rule
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
the
squire
,
"
I
will
propose
it
;
but
I
shall
certainly
lend
un
a
flick
,
if
he
should
refuse
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
fear
not
,
"
cry
Mrs
Western
;
"
the
match
be
too
advantageous
to
be
refuse
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
,
"
answer
the
squire
:
"
Allworthy
be
a
queer
b
 
ch
,
and
money
hath
no
effect
o'un
.
"
<EOS>
"
Brother
,
"
say
the
lady
,
"
your
politic
astonish
me
.
<EOS>
be
you
really
to
be
impose
on
by
profession
?
<EOS>
do
you
think
Mr
Allworthy
hath
more
contempt
for
money
than
other
man
because
he
profess
more
?
<EOS>
such
credulity
would
better
become
one
of
us
weak
woman
,
than
that
wise
sex
which
heaven
hath
form
for
politician
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
brother
,
you
would
make
a
fine
plenipo
to
negotiate
with
the
French
.
<EOS>
They
would
soon
persuade
you
,
that
they
take
town
out
of
mere
defensive
principle
.
"
<EOS>
"
Sister
,
"
answer
the
squire
,
with
much
scorn
,
"
let
your
friend
at
court
answer
for
the
town
take
;
as
you
be
a
woman
,
I
shall
lay
no
blame
upon
you
;
for
I
suppose
they
be
wise
than
to
trust
woman
with
secret
.
"
<EOS>
He
accompany
this
with
so
sarcastical
a
laugh
,
that
Mrs
Western
could
bear
no
longer
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
all
this
time
fret
in
a
tender
part
<EOS>
(
for
she
be
indeed
very
deeply
skilled
in
these
matter
,
and
very
violent
in
them
)
,
and
therefore
,
burst
forth
in
a
rage
,
declare
her
brother
to
be
both
a
clown
and
a
blockhead
,
and
that
she
would
stay
no
longer
in
his
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
squire
,
though
perhaps
he
have
never
read
Machiavel
,
be
,
however
,
in
many
point
,
a
perfect
politician
.
<EOS>
He
strongly
hold
all
those
wise
tenet
,
which
be
so
well
inculcate
in
that
Politico
-
Peripatetic
school
of
Exchange
-
alley
.
<EOS>
He
know
the
just
value
and
only
use
of
money
,
viz
.
,
to
lay
it
up
.
<EOS>
He
be
likewise
well
skilled
in
the
exact
value
of
reversion
,
expectation
,
&
c.
,
and
have
often
consider
the
amount
of
his
sister
's
fortune
,
and
the
chance
which
he
or
his
posterity
have
of
inherit
it
.
<EOS>
this
he
be
infinitely
too
wise
to
sacrifice
to
a
trifling
resentment
.
<EOS>
when
he
find
,
therefore
,
he
have
carry
matter
too
far
,
he
begin
to
think
of
reconcile
them
;
which
be
no
very
difficult
task
,
as
the
lady
have
great
affection
for
her
brother
,
and
still
great
for
her
niece
;
and
though
too
susceptible
of
an
affront
offer
to
her
skill
in
politic
,
on
which
she
much
value
herself
,
be
a
woman
of
a
very
extraordinary
good
and
sweet
disposition
.
  
<EOS>
have
first
,
therefore
,
lay
violent
hand
on
the
horse
,
for
whose
escape
from
the
stable
no
place
but
the
window
be
leave
open
,
he
next
apply
himself
to
his
sister
;
soften
and
soothe
her
,
by
unsay
all
he
have
say
,
and
by
assertion
directly
contrary
to
those
which
have
incense
her
.
<EOS>
lastly
,
he
summon
the
eloquence
of
Sophia
to
his
assistance
,
who
,
besides
a
most
graceful
and
win
address
,
have
the
advantage
of
be
hear
with
great
favour
and
partiality
by
her
aunt
.
  
<EOS>
the
result
of
the
whole
be
a
kind
smile
from
Mrs
Western
,
who
say
,
"
brother
,
you
be
absolutely
a
perfect
croat
;
but
as
those
have
their
use
in
the
army
of
the
empress
queen
,
so
you
likewise
have
some
good
in
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
therefore
once
more
sign
a
treaty
of
peace
with
you
,
and
see
that
you
do
not
infringe
it
on
your
side
;
at
least
,
as
you
be
so
excellent
a
politician
,
I
may
expect
you
will
keep
your
league
,
like
the
French
,
till
your
interest
call
upon
you
to
break
them
.
"
    
<EOS>
contain
two
defiance
to
the
critic
.
 
<EOS>
the
squire
have
settle
matter
with
his
sister
,
as
we
have
see
in
the
last
chapter
,
be
so
greatly
impatient
to
communicate
the
proposal
to
Allworthy
,
that
Mrs
Western
have
the
utmost
difficulty
to
prevent
him
from
visit
that
gentleman
in
his
sickness
,
for
this
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
have
be
engage
to
dine
with
Mr
Western
at
the
time
when
he
be
take
ill
.
<EOS>
He
be
therefore
no
sooner
discharge
out
of
the
custody
of
physic
,
but
he
think
(
as
be
usual
with
him
on
all
occasion
,
both
the
high
and
the
low
)
of
fulfil
his
engagement
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
interval
between
the
time
of
the
dialogue
in
the
last
chapter
,
and
this
day
of
public
entertainment
,
Sophia
have
,
from
certain
obscure
hint
throw
out
by
her
aunt
,
collect
some
apprehension
that
the
sagacious
lady
suspect
her
passion
for
Jones
.
<EOS>
She
now
resolve
to
take
this
opportunity
of
wipe
out
all
such
suspicion
,
and
for
that
purpose
to
put
an
entire
constraint
on
her
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
first
,
she
endeavour
to
conceal
a
throb
melancholy
heart
with
the
utmost
sprightliness
in
her
countenance
,
and
the
high
gaiety
in
her
manner
.
<EOS>
secondly
,
she
address
her
whole
discourse
to
Mr
Blifil
,
and
take
not
the
least
notice
of
poor
Jones
the
whole
day
.
  
<EOS>
the
squire
be
so
delighted
with
this
conduct
of
his
daughter
,
that
he
scarce
eat
any
dinner
,
and
spend
almost
his
whole
time
in
watch
opportunity
of
convey
sign
of
his
approbation
by
winks
and
nod
to
his
sister
;
who
be
not
at
first
altogether
so
pleased
with
what
she
see
as
be
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
Sophia
so
greatly
overact
her
part
,
that
her
aunt
be
at
first
stagger
,
and
begin
to
suspect
some
affectation
in
her
niece
;
but
as
she
be
herself
a
woman
of
great
art
,
so
she
soon
attribute
this
to
extreme
art
in
Sophia
.
<EOS>
She
remember
the
many
hint
she
have
give
her
niece
concern
her
be
in
love
,
and
imagine
the
young
lady
have
take
this
way
to
rally
her
out
of
her
opinion
,
by
an
overact
civility
:
a
notion
that
be
greatly
corroborate
by
the
excessive
gaiety
with
which
the
whole
be
accompany
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
here
avoid
remark
,
that
this
conjecture
would
have
be
better
found
<EOS>
have
Sophia
live
ten
year
in
the
air
of
Grosvenor
Square
,
where
young
lady
do
learn
a
wonderful
knack
of
rallying
and
play
with
that
passion
,
which
be
a
mighty
serious
thing
in
wood
and
grove
an
hundred
mile
distant
from
London
.
  
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
in
discover
the
deceit
of
other
,
it
matter
much
that
our
own
art
be
wind
up
,
if
I
may
use
the
expression
,
in
the
same
key
with
theirs
:
for
very
artful
man
sometimes
miscarry
by
fancy
other
wise
,
or
,
in
other
word
,
great
knave
,
than
they
really
be
.
<EOS>
as
this
observation
be
pretty
deep
,
I
will
illustrate
it
by
the
follow
short
story
.
<EOS>
three
countryman
be
pursue
a
Wiltshire
thief
through
Brentford
.
<EOS>
the
simple
of
them
see
"
the
Wiltshire
House
,
"
write
under
a
sign
,
advise
his
companion
to
enter
it
,
for
there
most
probably
they
would
find
their
countryman
.
<EOS>
the
second
,
who
be
wise
,
laugh
at
this
simplicity
;
but
the
third
,
who
be
wise
still
,
answer
,
"
let
us
go
in
,
however
,
for
he
may
think
we
should
not
suspect
him
of
go
amongst
his
own
countryman
.
<EOS>
"
They
accordingly
go
in
and
search
the
house
,
and
by
that
mean
miss
overtake
the
thief
,
who
be
at
that
time
but
a
little
way
before
them
;
and
who
,
as
they
all
know
,
but
have
never
once
reflect
,
could
not
read
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
will
pardon
a
digression
in
which
so
invaluable
a
secret
be
communicate
,
since
every
gamester
will
agree
how
necessary
it
be
to
know
exactly
the
play
of
another
,
in
order
to
countermine
him
.
<EOS>
this
will
,
moreover
,
afford
a
reason
why
the
wise
man
,
as
be
often
see
,
be
the
bubble
of
the
weak
,
and
why
many
simple
and
innocent
character
be
so
generally
misunderstood
and
misrepresented
;
but
what
be
most
material
,
this
will
account
for
the
deceit
which
Sophia
put
on
her
politic
aunt
.
  
<EOS>
dinner
be
end
,
and
the
company
retire
into
the
garden
,
Mr
Western
,
who
be
thoroughly
convince
of
the
certainty
of
what
his
sister
have
tell
him
,
take
Mr
Allworthy
aside
,
and
very
bluntly
propose
a
match
between
Sophia
and
young
Mr
Blifil
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
be
not
one
of
those
man
whose
heart
flutter
at
any
unexpected
and
sudden
tiding
of
worldly
profit
.
<EOS>
His
mind
be
,
indeed
,
temper
with
that
philosophy
which
become
a
man
and
a
Christian
.
<EOS>
He
affect
no
absolute
superiority
to
all
pleasure
and
pain
,
to
all
joy
and
grief
;
but
be
not
at
the
same
time
to
be
discompose
and
ruffle
by
every
accidental
blast
,
by
every
smile
or
frown
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
He
receive
,
therefore
,
Mr
Western
's
proposal
without
any
visible
emotion
,
or
without
any
alteration
of
countenance
.
<EOS>
He
say
the
alliance
be
such
as
he
sincerely
wish
;
then
launch
forth
into
a
very
just
encomium
on
the
young
lady
's
merit
;
acknowledge
the
offer
to
be
advantageous
in
point
of
fortune
;
and
after
thank
Mr
Western
for
the
good
opinion
he
have
profess
of
his
nephew
,
conclude
,
that
if
the
young
people
like
each
other
,
he
should
be
very
desirous
to
complete
the
affair
.
  
<EOS>
Western
be
a
little
disappointed
at
Mr
Allworthy
's
answer
,
which
be
not
so
warm
as
he
expect
.
<EOS>
He
treat
the
doubt
whether
the
young
people
may
like
one
another
with
great
contempt
,
say
,
"
that
parent
be
the
good
judge
of
proper
match
for
their
child
:
that
for
his
part
he
should
insist
on
the
most
resigned
obedience
from
his
daughter
:
and
if
any
young
fellow
could
refuse
such
a
bed
-
fellow
,
he
be
his
humble
servant
,
and
hope
there
be
no
harm
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
endeavour
to
soften
this
resentment
by
many
eulogium
on
Sophia
,
declare
he
have
no
doubt
but
that
Mr
Blifil
would
very
gladly
receive
the
offer
;
but
all
be
ineffectual
;
he
could
obtain
no
other
answer
from
the
squire
<EOS>
but
 
<EOS>
"
I
say
no
more
 
<EOS>
I
humbly
hope
there
be
no
harm
do
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
which
word
he
repeat
at
least
a
hundred
time
before
they
part
.
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
be
too
well
acquainted
with
his
neighbour
to
be
offend
at
this
behaviour
;
and
though
he
be
so
averse
to
the
rigour
which
some
parent
exercise
on
their
child
in
the
article
of
marriage
,
that
he
have
resolve
never
to
force
his
nephew
's
inclination
,
he
be
nevertheless
much
pleased
with
the
prospect
of
this
union
;
for
the
whole
country
resound
the
praise
of
Sophia
,
and
he
have
himself
greatly
admire
the
uncommon
endowment
of
both
her
mind
and
person
.
  
<EOS>
to
which
I
believe
we
may
add
,
the
consideration
of
her
vast
fortune
,
which
,
though
he
be
too
sober
to
be
intoxicate
with
it
,
he
be
too
sensible
to
despise
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
,
in
defiance
of
all
the
barking
critic
in
the
world
,
I
must
and
will
introduce
a
digression
concern
true
wisdom
,
of
which
Mr
Allworthy
be
in
reality
as
great
a
pattern
as
he
be
of
goodness
.
  
<EOS>
true
wisdom
then
,
notwithstanding
all
which
Mr
Hogarth
's
poor
poet
may
have
writ
against
rich
,
and
in
spite
of
all
which
any
rich
well
-
feed
divine
may
have
preach
against
pleasure
,
consist
not
in
the
contempt
of
either
of
these
.
<EOS>
a
man
may
have
as
much
wisdom
in
the
possession
of
an
affluent
fortune
,
as
any
beggar
in
the
street
;
or
may
enjoy
a
handsome
wife
or
a
hearty
friend
,
and
still
remain
as
wise
as
any
sour
popish
recluse
,
who
bury
all
his
social
faculty
,
and
starve
his
belly
while
he
well
lash
his
back
.
  
<EOS>
to
say
truth
,
the
wise
man
be
the
likeliest
to
possess
all
worldly
blessing
in
an
eminent
degree
;
for
as
that
moderation
which
wisdom
prescribe
be
the
sure
way
to
useful
wealth
,
so
can
it
alone
qualify
us
to
taste
many
pleasure
.
<EOS>
the
wise
man
gratifie
<EOS>
every
appetite
and
every
passion
,
while
the
fool
sacrifice
all
the
rest
to
pall
and
satiate
one
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
object
,
that
very
wise
man
have
be
notoriously
avaricious
.
<EOS>
I
answer
,
not
wise
in
that
instance
.
<EOS>
It
may
likewise
be
say
,
that
the
wise
man
have
be
in
their
youth
immoderately
fond
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
I
answer
,
They
be
not
wise
then
.
  
<EOS>
wisdom
,
in
short
,
whose
lesson
have
be
represent
as
so
hard
to
learn
by
those
who
never
be
at
her
school
,
only
teach
us
to
extend
a
simple
maxim
universally
know
and
follow
even
in
the
low
life
,
a
little
farther
than
that
life
carry
it
.
<EOS>
and
this
be
,
not
to
buy
at
too
dear
a
price
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
whoever
take
this
maxim
abroad
with
him
into
the
grand
market
of
the
world
,
and
constantly
apply
it
to
honour
,
to
rich
,
to
pleasure
,
and
to
every
other
commodity
which
that
market
afford
,
be
,
I
will
venture
to
affirm
,
a
wise
man
,
and
must
be
so
acknowledge
in
the
worldly
sense
of
the
word
;
for
he
make
the
good
of
bargain
,
since
in
reality
he
purchase
everything
at
the
price
only
of
a
little
trouble
,
and
carry
home
all
the
good
thing
I
have
mention
,
while
he
keep
his
health
,
his
innocence
,
and
his
reputation
,
the
common
price
which
be
pay
for
them
by
other
,
entire
and
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
from
this
moderation
,
likewise
,
he
learn
two
other
lesson
,
which
complete
his
character
.
<EOS>
first
,
never
to
be
intoxicate
when
he
hath
make
the
good
bargain
,
nor
deject
when
the
market
be
empty
,
or
when
its
commodity
be
too
dear
for
his
purchase
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
must
remember
on
what
subject
I
be
write
,
and
not
trespass
too
far
on
the
patience
of
a
good
-
natured
critic
.
<EOS>
here
,
therefore
,
I
put
an
end
to
the
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
contain
sundry
curious
matter
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Mr
Allworthy
return
home
,
he
take
Mr
Blifil
apart
,
and
after
some
preface
,
communicate
to
him
the
proposal
which
have
be
make
by
Mr
Western
,
and
at
the
same
time
inform
him
how
agreeable
this
match
would
be
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
the
charm
of
Sophia
have
not
make
the
least
impression
on
Blifil
;
not
that
his
heart
be
pre
-
engaged
;
neither
be
he
totally
insensible
of
beauty
,
or
have
any
aversion
to
woman
;
but
his
appetite
be
by
nature
so
moderate
,
that
he
be
able
,
by
philosophy
,
or
by
study
,
or
by
some
other
method
,
easily
to
subdue
them
:
and
as
to
that
passion
which
we
have
treat
of
in
the
first
chapter
of
this
book
,
he
have
not
the
least
tincture
of
it
in
his
whole
composition
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
he
be
so
entirely
free
from
that
mixed
passion
,
of
which
we
there
treat
,
and
of
which
the
virtue
and
beauty
of
Sophia
form
so
notable
an
object
;
yet
be
he
altogether
as
well
furnish
with
some
other
passion
<EOS>
,
that
promise
themselves
very
full
gratification
in
the
young
lady
's
fortune
.
<EOS>
such
be
avarice
and
ambition
,
which
divide
the
dominion
of
his
mind
between
them
.
<EOS>
He
have
more
than
once
consider
the
possession
of
this
fortune
as
a
very
desirable
thing
,
and
have
entertain
some
distant
view
concern
it
;
but
his
own
youth
,
and
that
of
the
young
lady
,
and
indeed
principally
a
reflection
that
Mr
Western
may
marry
again
,
and
have
more
child
,
have
restrain
him
from
too
hasty
or
eager
a
pursuit
.
  
<EOS>
this
last
and
most
material
objection
be
now
in
great
measure
remove
,
as
the
proposal
come
from
Mr
Western
himself
.
<EOS>
Blifil
,
therefore
,
after
a
very
short
hesitation
,
answer
Mr
Allworthy
,
that
matrimony
be
a
subject
on
which
he
have
not
yet
think
;
but
that
he
be
so
sensible
of
his
friendly
and
fatherly
care
,
that
he
should
in
all
thing
submit
himself
to
his
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
be
naturally
a
man
of
spirit
,
and
his
present
gravity
arise
from
true
wisdom
and
philosophy
,
not
from
any
original
phlegm
in
his
disposition
;
for
he
have
possess
much
fire
in
his
youth
,
and
have
marry
a
beautiful
woman
for
love
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
therefore
greatly
pleased
with
this
cold
answer
of
his
nephew
;
nor
could
he
help
launch
forth
into
the
praise
of
Sophia
,
and
express
some
wonder
that
the
heart
of
a
young
man
could
be
impregnable
to
the
force
of
such
charm
,
unless
it
be
guard
by
some
prior
affection
.
  
<EOS>
Blifil
assure
him
he
have
no
such
guard
;
and
then
proceed
to
discourse
so
wisely
and
religiously
on
love
and
marriage
,
that
he
would
have
stopt
the
mouth
of
a
parent
much
less
devoutly
incline
than
be
his
uncle
.
<EOS>
in
the
end
,
the
good
man
be
satisfied
that
his
nephew
,
far
from
have
any
objection
to
Sophia
,
have
that
esteem
for
her
,
which
in
sober
and
virtuous
mind
be
the
sure
foundation
of
friendship
and
love
.
<EOS>
and
as
he
doubt
not
but
the
lover
would
,
in
a
little
time
,
become
altogether
as
agreeable
to
his
mistress
,
he
foresee
great
happiness
arise
to
all
party
by
so
proper
and
desirable
an
union
.
<EOS>
with
Mr
Blifil
's
consent
therefore
he
write
the
next
morning
to
Mr
Western
,
acquaint
him
that
his
nephew
have
very
thankfully
and
gladly
receive
the
proposal
,
and
would
be
ready
to
wait
on
the
young
lady
,
whenever
she
should
be
pleased
to
accept
his
visit
.
  
<EOS>
Western
be
much
pleased
with
this
letter
,
and
immediately
return
an
answer
;
in
which
,
without
have
mention
a
word
to
his
daughter
,
he
appoint
that
very
afternoon
for
open
the
scene
of
courtship
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
have
dispatch
this
messenger
,
he
go
in
quest
of
his
sister
,
whom
he
find
read
and
expound
the
Gazette
to
parson
Supple
.
<EOS>
to
this
exposition
he
be
oblige
to
attend
near
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
though
with
great
violence
to
his
natural
impetuosity
,
before
he
be
suffer
to
speak
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
he
find
an
opportunity
of
acquaint
the
lady
,
that
he
have
business
of
great
consequence
to
impart
to
her
;
to
which
she
answer
,
"
brother
,
I
be
entirely
at
your

desire
her
to
communicate
the
affair
to
Sophia

which
she
readily
and
chearfully
undertook
;
though
perhaps
her

be

to
that
agreeable
northern
aspect
which
have
so
delight
her

that
he
hear
no

"
it
be
a
book

<EOS>
It
be
the
production
of
a
young
lady
of

whose
good

I

doth
honour

of
a

good

there
appear

me
a
great
deal
of
human
nature
in

in
many
part
so

true
tenderness

she
take
a
resolution

see
Mr

no

it

more
properer

I
be
sure
my

never

I

they

I

like

your

money
enough

Honour
do
immediately
as
she
be
bid
,
and
Sophia
put
her
hat
on
;
when
,
look
in
the
glass
,
she
fancy
the
ribbon
with
which
her
hat
be
tie
do
not
become
her

and
so
send
her
maid
back
again
for
a
ribbon
of
a
different
colour
;
and
then
give
Mrs
Honour
repeat
charge
not
to
leave
her
work
on
any
account
,
as
she
say
it
be
in
violent
haste
,
and
must
be
finish
that
very
day
<EOS>
,
she
mutter
something
more
about
go
to
the
grove
,
and
then
sally
out
the
contrary
way
,
and
walk
,
as
fast
as
her
tender
tremble
limb
could
carry
her
,
directly
towards
the
canal
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
have
be
there
as
Mrs
Honour
have
tell
her
;
he
have
indeed
spend
two
hour
there
that
morning
in
melancholy
contemplation
on
his
Sophia
,
and
have
go
out
from
the
garden
at
one
door
the
moment
she
enter
it
at
another
.
<EOS>
so
that
those
unlucky
minute
which
have
be
spend
in
change
the
ribbon
,
have
prevent
the
lover
from
meet
at
this
time
;
 
a
most
unfortunate
accident
,
from
which
my
fair
reader
will
not
fail
to
draw
a
very
wholesome
lesson
.
<EOS>
and
here
I
strictly
forbid
all
male
critic
to
intermeddle
with
a
circumstance
which
I
have
recount
only
for
the
sake
of
the
lady
,
and
upon
which
they
only
be
at
liberty
to
comment
.
    
<EOS>
a
picture
of
formal
courtship
in
miniature
,
as
it
always
ought
to
be
draw
,
and
a
scene
of
a
tenderer
kind
paint
at
full
length
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
well
remark
by
one
(
and
perhaps
by
more
)
,
that
misfortune
do
not
come
single
.
<EOS>
this
wise
maxim
be
now
verify
by
Sophia
,
who
be
not
only
disappointed
of
see
the
man
she
love
,
but
have
the
vexation
of
be
oblige
to
dress
herself
out
,
in
order
to
receive
a
visit
from
the
man
she
hate
.
  
<EOS>
that
afternoon
Mr
Western
,
for
the
first
time
,
acquaint
his
daughter
with
his
intention
;
tell
her
,
he
know
very
well
that
she
have
hear
it
before
from
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
Sophia
look
very
grave
upon
this
,
nor
could
she
prevent
a
few
pearl
from
steal
into
her
eye
.
<EOS>
"
come
,
come
,
"
say
Western
,
"
none
of
your
maidenish
air
;
I
know
all
;
I
assure
you
<EOS>
sister
hath
tell
me
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
possible
,
"
say
Sophia
,
"
that
my
aunt
can
have
betray
me
already
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
,
"
say
western
;
"
betray
you
!
<EOS>
ay
.
<EOS>
why
,
you
betray
yourself
yesterday
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
You
show
your
fancy
very
plainly
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
but
you
young
girl
never
know
what
you
would
be
at
.
<EOS>
so
you
cry
because
I
be
go
to
marry
you
to
the
man
you
be
in
love
with
!
<EOS>
Your
mother
,
I
remember
,
whimper
and
whine
just
in
the
same
manner
;
but
it
be
all
over
within
twenty
-
four
hour
after
we
be
married
:
Mr
Blifil
be
a
brisk
young
man
,
and
will
soon
put
an
end
to
your
squeamishness
.
<EOS>
come
,
chear
up
,
chear
up
;
I
expect
un
every
minute
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sophia
be
now
convince
that
her
aunt
have
behave
honourably
to
her
:
and
she
determine
to
go
through
that
disagreeable
afternoon
with
as
much
resolution
as
possible
,
and
without
give
the
least
suspicion
in
the
world
to
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Blifil
soon
arrive
;
and
<EOS>
Mr
Western
soon
after
withdraw
,
leave
the
young
couple
together
.
  
<EOS>
here
a
long
silence
of
near
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ensue
;
for
the
gentleman
who
be
to
begin
the
conversation
have
all
the
unbecoming
modesty
which
consist
in
bashfulness
.
<EOS>
He
often
attempt
to
speak
,
and
as
often
suppress
his
word
just
at
the
very
point
of
utterance
.
<EOS>
at
last
out
they
break
in
a
torrent
of
far
-
fetched
and
high
-
strained
compliment
,
which
be
answer
on
her
side
by
downcast
look
,
half
bow
,
and
civil
monosyllable
.
<EOS>
Blifil
,
from
his
inexperience
in
the
way
of
woman
,
and
from
his
conceit
of
himself
,
take
this
behaviour
for
a
modest
assent
to
his
courtship
;
and
when
,
to
shorten
a
scene
which
she
could
no
longer
support
,
Sophia
rise
up
and
leave
the
room
,
he
impute
that
,
too
,
merely
to
bashfulness
,
and
comfort
himself
that
he
should
soon
have
enough
of
her
company
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
indeed
perfectly
well
satisfied
with
his
prospect
of
success
;
for
as
to
that
entire
and
absolute
possession
of
the
heart
of
his
mistress
which
romantic
lover
require
,
the
very
idea
of
it
never
enter
his
head
.
<EOS>
Her
fortune
and
her
person
be
the
sole
object
of
his
wish
,
of
which
he
make
no
doubt
soon
to
obtain
the
absolute
property
;
as
Mr
Western
's
mind
be
so
earnestly
bent
on
the
match
;
and
as
he
well
know
the
strict
obedience
which
Sophia
be
always
ready
to
pay
to
her
father
's
will
,
and
the
great
still
which
her
father
would
exact
,
if
there
be
occasion
.
<EOS>
this
authority
,
therefore
,
together
with
the
charm
which
he
fancy
in
his
own
person
and
conversation
,
could
not
fail
,
he
think
,
of
succeed
with
a
young
lady
,
whose
inclination
be
,
he
doubt
not
,
entirely
disengaged
.
  
<EOS>
of
Jones
he
certainly
have
not
even
the
least
jealousy
;
and
I
have
often
think
it
wonderful
that
he
have
not
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
imagine
the
character
which
Jones
bear
all
over
the
country
<EOS>
(
how
justly
,
let
the
reader
determine
)
,
of
be
one
of
the
wild
fellow
in
England
,
may
render
him
odious
to
a
lady
of
the
most
exemplary
modesty
.
<EOS>
perhaps
his
suspicion
may
be
lay
asleep
by
the
behaviour
of
Sophia
,
and
of
Jones
himself
,
when
they
be
all
in
company
together
.
<EOS>
lastly
,
and
indeed
principally
,
he
be
well
assure
there
be
not
another
self
in
the
case
.
<EOS>
He
fancy
that
he
know
Jones
to
the
bottom
,
and
have
in
reality
a
great
contempt
for
his
understanding
,
for
not
be
more
attached
to
his
own
interest
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
apprehension
that
Jones
be
in
love
with
Sophia
;
and
as
for
any
lucrative
motive
,
he
imagine
they
would
sway
very
little
with
so
silly
a
fellow
.
<EOS>
Blifil
,
moreover
,
think
the
affair
of
Molly
Seagrim
still
go
on
,
and
indeed
believe
it
would
end
in
marriage
;
for
Jones
really
love
him
from
his
childhood
,
and
have
keep
no
secret
from
him
,
till
his
behaviour
on
the
sickness
of
Mr
Allworthy
have
entirely
alienate
his
heart
;
and
it
be
by
mean
of
the
quarrel
which
have
ensue
on
this
occasion
,
and
which
be
not
yet
reconcile
,
that
Mr
Blifil
know
nothing
of
the
alteration
which
have
happen
in
the
affection
which
Jones
have
formerly
bear
towards
Molly
.
  
<EOS>
from
these
reason
,
therefore
,
Mr
Blifil
see
no
bar
to
his
success
with
Sophia
.
<EOS>
He
conclude
her
behaviour
be
like
that
of
all
other
young
lady
on
a
first
visit
from
a
lover
,
and
it
have
indeed
entirely
answer
his
expectation
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Western
take
care
to
<EOS>
way
-
lie
the
lover
at
his
exit
from
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
He
find
him
so
elevated
with
his
success
,
so
enamour
with
his
daughter
,
and
so
satisfied
with
her
reception
of
him
,
that
the
old
gentleman
begin
to
caper
and
dance
about
his
hall
,
and
by
many
other
antic
action
to
express
the
extravagance
of
his
joy
;
for
he
have
not
the
least
command
over
any
of
his
passion
;
and
that
which
have
at
any
time
the
ascendant
in
his
mind
hurry
him
to
the
wild
excess
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Blifil
be
depart
,
which
be
not
till
after
many
hearty
kiss
and
embrace
bestow
on
him
by
Western
,
the
good
squire
go
instantly
in
quest
of
his
daughter
,
whom
he
no
sooner
find
than
he
pour
forth
the
most
extravagant
rapture
,
bid
her
chuse
what
clothe
and
jewel
she
please
;
and
declare
that
he
have
no
other
use
for
fortune
but
to
make
her
happy
.
<EOS>
He
then
caress
her
again
and
again
with
the
utmost
profusion
of
fondness
,
call
her
by
the
most
endearing
name
,
and
protest
she
be
his
only
joy
on
earth
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
perceive
her
father
in
this
fit
of
affection
,
which
she
do
not
absolutely
know
the
reason
of
(
for
fit
of
fondness
be
not
unusual
to
him
,
though
this
be
rather
more
violent
than
ordinary
)
<EOS>
,
think
she
should
never
have
a
well
opportunity
of
disclose
herself
than
at
present
,
as
far
at
least
as
regard
Mr
Blifil
;
and
she
too
well
foresaw
the
necessity
which
she
should
soon
be
under
of
come
to
a
full
explanation
.
<EOS>
after
have
thank
the
squire
,
therefore
,
for
all
his
profession
of
kindness
,
she
add
,
with
a
look
full
of
inexpressible
softness
,
"
<EOS>
and
be
it
possible
my
papa
can
be
so
good
to
place
all
his
joy
in
his
Sophy
's
happiness
?
"
<EOS>
which
Western
have
confirm
by
a
great
oath
,
and
a
kiss
;
she
then
lay
hold
of
his
hand
,
and
,
fall
on
her
knee
,
after
many
warm
and
passionate
declaration
of
affection
and
duty
,
she
beg
him
"
not
to
make
her
the
most
miserable
creature
on

her

<EOS>
this
he
bind
by
an
oath
too
shocking
to
repeat
;
and
after
many
violent
asseveration
,
conclude
in
these
word
:

I
be
resolve
upon

no

I
see

famine
in

I
would
not

a
morsel
of
bread

this
be
my
fix
resolution

so
I
leave
you
to
consider
on
it

"
<EOS>
He
then
break
from
her
with
such
violence
,
that
her
face
dash
against
the
floor
;
and
he
burst
directly
out
of
the
room
,
leave
poor
Sophia
prostrate
on
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
when
Western
come
into
the
hall
,
he
there
find
Jones
;
who
see
his
friend
look
wild
,
pale
,
and
almost
breathless
,
could
not
forbear
enquire
the
reason
of
all
these
melancholy
appearance
.
<EOS>
upon
which
the
squire
immediately
acquaint
him
with
the
whole
matter
,
conclude
with
bitter
denunciation
against
Sophia
,
and
very
pathetic
lamentation
of
the
misery
of
all
father
who
be
so
unfortunate
to
have
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
,
to
whom
all
the
resolution
which
have
be
take
in
favour
of
Blifil
be
yet
a
secret
,
be
at
first
almost
strike
dead
with
this
relation
;
but
recover
his
spirit
a
little
,
mere
despair
,
as
he
afterwards
say
,
inspire
him
to
mention
a
matter
to
Mr
Western
,
which
seem
to
require
more
impudence
than
a
human
forehead
be
ever
gift
with
.
<EOS>
He
desire
leave
to
go
to
Sophia
,
that
he
may
endeavour
to
obtain
her
concurrence
with
her
father
's
inclination
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
squire
have
be
as
quicksighte
as
he
be
remarkable
for
the
contrary
,
passion
may
at
present
very
well
have
blind
him
.
<EOS>
He
thank
Jones
for
offer
to
undertake
the
office
,
and
say
,
"
go
,
go
,
prithee
,
try
what
canst
do
;
"
and
then
swear
many
execrable
oath
that
he
would
turn
her
out
of
door
unless
she
consent
to
the
match
.
    
<EOS>
the
meeting
between
Jones
and
Sophia
.
 
<EOS>
Jones
depart
instantly
in
quest
of
Sophia
,
whom
he
find
just
rise
from
the
ground
,
where
her
father
have
leave
her
,
with
the
tear
trickle
from
her
eye
,
and
the
blood
run
from
her
lip
.
<EOS>
He
presently
run
to
her
,
and
with
a
voice
full
at
once
of
tenderness
and
terrour
,
cry
,
"
o
my
Sophia
,
what
mean
this
dreadful
sight
?
"
<EOS>
She
look
softly
at
him
for
a
moment
before
she
speak
,
and
then
say
,
"
Mr
Jones
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
<EOS>
how
come
you
here
?
 
<EOS>
leave
me
,
I
beseech
you
,
this
moment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
,
"
say
he
,
"
impose
so
harsh
a
command
upon
me
 
<EOS>
my
heart
bleed
faster
than
those
lip
.
<EOS>
o
Sophia
,
how
easily
could
I
drain
my
vein
to
preserve
one
drop
of
that
dear
blood
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
too
many
obligation
to
you
already
,
"
answer
she
,
"
for
sure
you
mean
them
such
.
<EOS>
"
here
she
look
at
him
tenderly
almost
a
minute
,
and
then
burst
into
an
agony
,
cry
,
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Mr
Jones
,
why
do
you
save
my
life
?
<EOS>
my
death
would
have
be
happy
for
us
both
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Happier
for
us
both
!
"
<EOS>
cry
he
.
"
<EOS>
Could
racks
or
wheel
kill
me
so
painfully
as
Sophia
's
 
I
can
not
bear
the
dreadful
sound
.
<EOS>
do
I
live
but
for
her
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
both
his
voice
and
look
be
full
of
inexpressible
tenderness
when
he
speak
these
word
;
and
at
the
same
time
he
lay
gently
hold
on
her
hand
,
which
she
do
not
withdraw
from
him
;
to
say
the
truth
,
she
hardly
know
what
she
do
or
suffer
.
<EOS>
a
few
moment
now
pass
in
silence
between
these
lover
,
while
his
eye
be
eagerly
fix
on
Sophia
,
and
her
decline
towards
the
ground
:
at
last
she
recover
strength
enough
to
desire
him
again
to
leave
her
,
for
that
her
certain
ruin
would
be
the
consequence
of
their
be
find
together
;
add
,
"

She
stand
a
moment
silent

and
cover
with
confusion
;
then
lift
up

eye
gently
towards
him
,
she
cry

while

Jones
,
"
by
exact
a
power
over

<EOS>
think
on
the
misery
which
I
be
to
suffer

I
be
to
lose
you

see
on
which
side
pity
will
turn
the
balance

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
think
of

she
:
"
can
you
imagine
I

It

<EOS>
"
I
fear
no

"
but
the
loss
of
Sophia

<EOS>
if
you
would
save
me
from
the
most
bitter
agony
,
recall
that
cruel
sentence

indeed
,
I
can
never

you

indeed
I

"
  
<EOS>
the
lover
now
stand
both
silent
and
tremble
,
Sophia
be
unable
to
withdraw
her
hand
from
Jones
,
and
he
almost
as
unable
to
hold
it
;
when
the
scene
,
which
I
believe
some
of
my
reader
will
think
have
last
long
enough
,
be
interrupt
by
one
of
so
different
a
nature
,
that
we
shall
reserve
the
relation
of
it
for
a
different
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
be
of
a
much
more
tempestuous
kind
than
the
former
.
 
<EOS>
before
we
proceed
with
what
now
happen
to
our
lover
,
it
may
be
proper
to
recount
what
have
past
in
the
hall
during
their
tender
interview
.
  
<EOS>
soon
after
Jones
have
leave
Mr
Western
in
the
manner
above
mention
,
his
sister
come
to
him
,
and
be
presently
inform
of
all
that
have
pass
between
her
brother
and
Sophia
relate
to
Blifil
.
  
<EOS>
this
behaviour
in
her
niece
<EOS>
the
good
lady
construe
to
be
an
absolute
breach
of
the
condition
on
which
she
have
engage
to
keep
her
love
for
Mr
Jones
a
secret
.
<EOS>
She
consider
herself
,
therefore
,
at
full
liberty
to
reveal
all
she
know
to
the
squire
,
which
she
immediately
do
in
the
most
explicit
term
,
and
without
any
ceremony
or
preface
.
  
<EOS>
the
idea
of
a
marriage
between
Jones
and
his
daughter
,
have
never
once
enter
into
the
squire
's
head
,
either
in
the
warm
minute
of
his
affection
towards
that
young
man
,
or
from
suspicion
,
or
on
any
other
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
do
indeed
consider
a
parity
of
fortune
and
circumstance
to
be
physically
as
necessary
an
ingredient
in
marriage
,
as
difference
of
sex
,
or
any
other
essential
;
and
have
no
more
apprehension
of
his
daughter
's
fall
in
love
with
a
poor
man
,
than
with
any
animal
of
a
different
specie
.
  
<EOS>
He
become
,
therefore
,
like
one
thunderstruck
at
his
sister
's
relation
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
at
first
,
incapable
of
make
any
answer
,
have
be
almost
deprive
of
his
breath
by
the
violence
of
the
surprize
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
soon
return
,
and
,
as
be
usual
in
other
case
after
an
intermission
,
with
redouble
force
and
fury
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
use
he
make
of
the
power
of
speech
,
after
his
recovery
from
the
sudden
effect
of
his
astonishment
,
be
to
discharge
a
round
volley
of
oath
and
imprecation
.
<EOS>
after
which
he
proceed
hastily
to
the
apartment
where
he
expect
to
find
the
lover
,
and
murmur
,
or
rather
indeed
roar
forth
,
intention
of
revenge
every
step
he
go
.
  
<EOS>
as
when
two
dove
,
or
two
wood
-
pigeon
,
or
as
when
Strephon
and
Phyllis
(
for
that
come
near
to
the
mark
)
be
retire
into
some
pleasant
solitary
grove
,
to
enjoy
the
delightful
conversation
of
Love
,
that
bashful
boy
,
who
can
not
speak
in
public
,
and
be
never
a
good
companion
to
more
than
two
at
a
time
;
here
,
while
every
object
be
serene
,
should
hoarse
thunder
burst
suddenly
through
the
shatter
cloud
,
and
rumble
roll
along
the
sky
,
the
frightened
maid
start
from
the
mossy
bank
or
verdant
turf
,
the
pale
livery
of
death
succeed
the
red
regimental
in
which
Love
have
before
dr
her
cheek
,
fear
shake
her
whole
frame
,
and
her
lover
scarce
support
her
tremble
tottering
limb
.
  
<EOS>
or
as
when
two
gentleman
,
stranger
to
the
wondrous
wit
of
the
place
,
be
crack
a
bottle
together
at
some
inn
or
tavern
at
Salisbury
,
if
the
great
Dowdy
,
who
act
the
part
of
a
madman
as
well
as
some
of
his
setter
-
on
do
that
of
a
fool
,
should
rattle
his
chain
,
and
dreadfully
hum
forth
the
grumble
catch
along
the
gallery
<EOS>
;
the
fright
stranger
stand
aghast
;
scared
at
the
horrid
sound
,
they
seek
some
place
of
shelter
from
the
approach
danger
;
and
if
the
well
-
bar
window
do
admit
their
exit
,
would
venture
their
neck
to
escape
the
threaten
fury
now
come
upon
them
.
  
<EOS>
so
tremble
poor
Sophia
,
so
turn
she
pale
at
the
noise
of
her
father
,
who
,
in
a
voice
most
dreadful
to
hear
,
come
on
swear
,
cursing
,
and
vow
the
destruction
of
Jones
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
I
believe
the
youth
himself
would
,
from
some
prudent
consideration
,
have
prefer
another
place
of
abode
at
this
time
,
have
his
terror
on
Sophia
's
account
<EOS>
give
him
liberty
to
reflect
a
moment
on
what
any
otherways
concern
himself
,
than
as
his
love
make
him
partake
whatever
affect
her
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
the
squire
,
have
burst
open
the
door
,
beheld
an
object
which
instantly
suspend
all
his
fury
against
Jones
;
this
be
the
ghastly
appearance
of
Sophia
,
who
have
faint
away
in
her
lover
's
arm
.
<EOS>
this
tragical
sight
<EOS>
Mr
Western
no
sooner
beheld
,
than
all
his
rage
forsook
him
;
he
roar
for
help
with
his
utmost
violence
;
run
first
to
his
daughter
,
then
back
to
the
door
call
for
water
,
and
then
back
again
to
Sophia
,
never
consider
in
whose
arm
she
then
be
,
nor
perhaps
once
recollect
that
there
be
such
a
person
in
the
world
as
Jones
;
for
indeed
I
believe
the
present
circumstance
of
his
daughter
be
now
the
sole
consideration
which
employ
his
thought
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Western
and
a
great
number
of
servant
soon
come
to
the
assistance
of
Sophia
with
water
,
cordial
,
and
everything
necessary
on
those
occasion
.
<EOS>
these
be
apply
with
such
success
,
that
Sophia
in
a
very
few
minute
begin
to
recover
,
and
all
the
symptom
of
life
to
return
.
<EOS>
upon
which
she
be
presently
lead
off
by
her
own
maid
and
Mrs
Western
:
nor
do
that
good
lady
depart
without
leave
some
wholesome
admonition
with
her
brother
,
on
the
dreadful
effect
of
his
passion
,
or
,
as
she
please
to
call
it
,
madness
.
  
<EOS>
the
squire
,
perhaps
,
do
not
understand
this
good
advice
,
as
it
be
deliver
in
obscure
hint
,
shrug
,
and
note
of
admiration
:
at
least
,
if
he
do
understand
it
,
he
profit
very
little
by
it
;
for
no
sooner
be
he
cure
of
his
immediate
fear
for
his
daughter
,
than
he
relapse
into
his
former
frenzy
,
which
must
have
produce
an
immediate
battle
with
Jones
,
have
not
parson
Supple
,
who
be
a
very
strong
man
,
be
present
,
and
by
mere
force
restrain
the
squire
from
act
of
hostility
.
  
<EOS>
the
moment
Sophia
be
depart
,
Jones
advance
in
a
very
suppliant
manner
to
Mr
Western
,
whom
the
parson
hold
in
his
arm
,
and
beg
him
to
be
pacify
;
for
that
,
while
he
continue
in
such
a
passion
,
it
would
be
impossible
to
give
him
any
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wull
have
satisfaction
o
'
thee
,
"
answer
the
squire
;
"
so
doff
thy
clothe
.
<EOS>
at
unt
half
a
man
,
and
I
will
lick
thee
as
well
as
wast
ever
lick
in
thy
life
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
bespatter
the
youth
with
abundance
of
that
language
which
pass
between
country
gentleman
who
embrace
opposite
side
of
the
question
;
with
frequent
application
to
him
to
salute
that
part
which
be
generally
introduce
into
all
controversy
that
arise
among
the
low
order
of
the
english
gentry
at
horse
-
race
,
cock
-
match
,
and
other
public
place
.
<EOS>
allusion
to
this
part
be
likewise
often
make
for
the
sake
of
the
jest
.
<EOS>
and
here
,
I
believe
,
the
wit
be
generally
misunderstood
.
<EOS>
in
reality
,
it
lie
in
desire
another
to
kiss
your
a
#
#
#
#
for
have
just
before
threaten
to
kick
his
;
for
I
have
observe
very
accurately
,
that
no
one
ever
desire
you
to
kick
that
which
belong
to
himself
,
nor
offer
to
kiss
this
part
in
another
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
likewise
seem
surprize
that
in
the
many
thousand
kind
invitation
of
this
sort
,
which
every
one
who
hath
converse
with
country
gentleman
must
have
hear
,
no
one
,
I
believe
,
hath
ever
see
a
single
instance
where
the
desire
hath
be
comply
with
;
 
a
great
instance
of
their
want
of
politeness
;
for
in
town
nothing
can
be
more
common
than
for
the
fine
gentleman
to
perform
this
ceremony
every
day
to
their
superior
,
without
have
that
favour
once
request
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
to
all
such
wit
,
Jones
very
calmly
answer
,
"
Sir
,
this
usage
may
perhaps
cancel
every
other
obligation
you
have
confer
on
me
;
but
there
be
one
you
can
never
cancel
;
nor
will
I
be
provoke
by
your
abuse
to
lift
my
hand
against
the
father
of
Sophia
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
these
word
the
squire
grow
still
more
outrageous
than
before
;
so
that
the
parson
beg
Jones
to
retire
;
say
,
"
You
behold
,
sir
,
how
he
waxeth
wrath
at
your
abode
here
<EOS>
;
therefore
let
me
pray
you
not
to
tarry
any
longer
.
<EOS>
His
anger
be
too
much
kindle
for
you
to
commune
with
him
at
present
.
<EOS>
You
have
well
,
therefore
,
conclude
your
visit
,
and
refer
what
matter
you
have
to
urge
in
your
behalf
to
some
other
opportunity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
accept
this
advice
with
thank
,
and
immediately
depart
.
<EOS>
the
squire
now
regain
the
liberty
of
his
hand
,
and
so
much
temper
as
to
express
some
satisfaction
in
the
restraint
which
have
be
lay
upon
him
;
declare
that
he
should
certainly
have
beat
his
brain
out
;
and
add
,
"
It
would
have
vex
one
confoundedly
to
have
be
hang
for
such
a
rascal
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
parson
now
begin
to
triumph
in
the
success
of
his
peace
-
make
endeavour
,
and
proceed
to
read
a
lecture
against
anger
,
which
may
perhaps
rather
have
tend
to
raise
than
to
quiet
that
passion
in
some
hasty
mind
.
<EOS>
this
lecture
he
enrich
with
many
valuable
quotation
from
the
antient
,
particularly
from
Seneca
;
who
hath
indeed
so
well
handle
this
passion
,
that
none
but
a
very
angry
man
can
read
him
without
great
pleasure
and
profit
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
conclude
this
harangue
with
the
famous
story
of
Alexander
and
Clitus
;
but
as
I
find
that
enter
in
my
common
-
place
under
title
Drunkenness
,
I
shall
not
insert
it
here
.
  
<EOS>
the
squire
take
no
notice
of
this
story
,
nor
perhaps
of
anything
he
say
;
for
he
interrupt
him
before
he
have
finish
,
by
call
for
a
tankard
of
beer
;
observe
(
which
be
perhaps
as
true
as
any
observation
on
this
fever
of
the
mind
)
<EOS>
that
anger
make
a
man
dry
.
  
<EOS>
no
sooner
have
the
squire
swallow
a
large
draught
than
he
renew
the
discourse
on
Jones
,
and
declare
a
resolution
of
go
the
next
morning
early
to
acquaint
Mr
Allworthy
.
<EOS>
His
friend
would
have
dissuade
him
from
this
,
from
the
mere
motive
of
good
-
nature
;
but
his
dissuasion
have
no
other
effect
than
to
produce
a
large
volley
of
oath
and
curse
,
which
greatly
shock
the
pious
ear
of
Supple
;
but
he
do
not
dare
to
remonstrate
against
a
privilege
which
the
squire
claim
as
a
freeborn
Englishman
.
<EOS>
to
say
truth
,
the
parson
submit
to
please
his
palate
at
the
squire
's
table
,
at
the
expense
of
suffer
now
and
then
this
violence
to
his
ear
.
<EOS>
He
content
himself
with
think
he
do
not
promote
this
evil
practice
,
and
that
the
squire
would
not
swear
an
oath
the
less
,
if
he
never
enter
within
his
gate
.
<EOS>
however
,
though
he
be
not
guilty
of
ill
manner
by
rebuke
a
gentleman
in
his
own
house
,
he
pay
him
off
obliquely
in
the
pulpit
:
which
have
not
,
indeed
,
the
good
effect
of
work
a
reformation
in
the
squire
himself
;
yet
it
so
far
operate
on
his
conscience
,
that
he
put
the
law
very
severely
in
execution
against
other
,
and
the
magistrate
be
the
only
person
in
the
parish
who
could
swear
with
impunity
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
Mr
western
visit
Mr
Allworthy
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
be
now
retire
from
breakfast
with
his
nephew
,
well
satisfied
with
the
report
of
the
young
gentleman
's
successful
visit
to
Sophia
<EOS>
(
for
he
greatly
desire
the
match
,
more
on
account
of
the
young
lady
's
character
than
of
her
riches
)
,
when
Mr
Western
break
abruptly
in
upon
them
,
and
without
any
ceremony
begin
as
follow
:
    
<EOS>
"
there
,
you
have
do
a
fine
piece
of
work
truly
!
<EOS>
You
have
bring
up
your
bastard
to
a
fine
purpose
;
not
that
I
believe
you
have
have
any
hand
in
it
neither
,
that
is
,
as
a
man
may
say
,
designedly
:
but
there
be
a
fine
kettle
-
of
-
fish
make
on't
up
at
our
house
.
"
<EOS>
"
what
can
be
the
matter
,
Mr
Western
?
"
say
Allworthy
.
<EOS>
"
o
,
matter
enow
of
all
conscience
:
my
daughter
hath
fall
in
love
with
your
bastard
,
that
be
all
;
but
I
will
not
ge
her
a
hapeny
,
not
the
twentieth
part
of
a
brass
varden
.
<EOS>
I
always
think
what
would
come
o
'
breed
up
a
bastard
like
a
gentleman
,
and
let
un
come
about
to
vok
's
house
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
vor
<EOS>
un
<EOS>
I
could
not

I
would
a
lick'd
un

I
would
<EOS>
a
spoil'd

his
caterwauling
;
I
would
a
taught
the
son
of
a
whore
to
meddle
with
meat
for
his
master
.
<EOS>
He
shall
not
ever
have
a
morsel
of
meat
of
mine
,
or
a
varden
to
buy
it
:
if
she
will
ha
un

one
smock
shall
be
her
portion
.
<EOS>
I
would
sooner
ge
my
esteate
to
the
zinking
fund
,
that
it
may
be
send
to
Hanover
to
corrupt
our
nation
with

"
<EOS>
"
I
be
heartily
sorry
,
"
cry
Allworthy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>

your
sorrow

say
Western
;
"
it
will

abundance
of

I
be
in
amazement

Allworthy

"
at
what
you
tell
me

after

<EOS>
"
yes

answer
western
,
"
it
be
after
what
pass
between

<EOS>
Mr
Blifil
there
be
no
sooner
go
than
the
son
of

come
lurch
about

<EOS>
little
do
I

love
him
for
a
sportsman
that
he
be
all
the
while
a
poaching
after
my
daughter

"
<EOS>
"
why
truly
,
"
say
Allworthy
,
"
I
could
wish
you
have
not
give
him
so
many
opportunity
with
her
;
and
you
will
do
me
the
justice
to
acknowledge
that
I
have
always
be
averse
to
his
staying
so
much
at
your
house

though
I
own
<EOS>
I
have
no
suspicion
of
this
kind

"
<EOS>
"
why
,
zounds
,
"
cry
western
,
"
who
could
have
think
it

<EOS>
what
the
devil
have
she

<EOS>
He
do
not
come
there
a
courting
to
her
;
he
come
there
a
hunting
with
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
but
be
it
possible
,
"
say
Allworthy
,
"
that
you
should
never
discern
any
symptom
of
love
between
them
,
when
you
have
see
them
so
often
together
?
"
<EOS>
"
never
in
my
life
,
as
I
hope
to
be
save
,
"
cry
western
:
"
I
never
so
much
as
zeed
him
kiss
her
in
all
my
life
;
and
so
far
from
court
her
,
he
use
rather
to
be
more
silent
when
she
be
in
company
than
at
any
other
time
;
and
as
for
the
girl
,
she
be
always
less
civil
to'n
than
to
any
young
man
that
come
to
the
house

<EOS>
as
to
that
matter
,
I
be
not
more
easy
to
be
deceive
than
another
;
I
would
not
have
you
think
I
be

neighbour

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Allworthy
could
scarce
refrain
laughter
at
this
;
but
he
resolve
to
do
a
violence
to
himself
;
for
he
perfectly
well
know
mankind
,
and
have
too
much
good
-
breeding
and
good
-
nature
to
offend
the
squire
in
his
present
circumstance
.
<EOS>
He
then
ask
Western
what
he
would
have
him
do
upon
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
to
which
the
other
answer
,
"
that
he
would
have
him
keep
the
rascal
away
from
his
house
,
and
that
he
would
go
and
lock
up
the
wench
;
for
he
be
resolve
to
make
her
marry
Mr
Blifil
in
spite
of
her
tooth
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
shake
Blifil
by
the
hand
,
and
swear
he
would
have
no
other
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
presently
after
which
he
take
his
leave
;
say
his
house
be
in
such
disorder
that
it
be
necessary
for
him
to
make
haste
home
,
to
take
care
<EOS>
his
daughter
do
not
give
him
the
slip
;
and
as
for
Jones
,
he
swear
if
he
catch
him
at
his
house
,
he
would
qualify
him
to
run
for
the
gelding
'
plate
.
  
<EOS>
when
Allworthy
and
Blifil
be
again
leave
together
,
a
long
silence
ensue
between
them
;
all
which
interval
the
young
gentleman
fill
up
with
sigh
,
which
proceed
partly
from
disappointment
,
but
more
from
hatred
;
for
the
success
of
Jones
be
much
more
grievous
to
him
than
the
loss
of
Sophia
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
his
uncle
ask
him
what
he
be
determined
to
do
,
and
he
answer
in
the
follow
word
:
 
"
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
sir
,
can
it
be
a
question
what
step
a
lover
will
take
,
when
reason
and
passion
point
different
way
?
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
it
be
too
certain
he
will
,
in
that
dilemma
,
always
follow
the
latter
.
<EOS>
reason
dictate
to
me
,
to
quit
all
thought
of
a
woman
who
place
her
affection
on
another
;
my
passion
bid
me
<EOS>
hope
she
may
in
time
change
her
inclination
in
my
favour
.
<EOS>
here
,
however
,
I
conceive
an
objection
may
be
raise
,
which
,
if
it
could
not
fully
be
answer
,
would
totally
deter
me
from
any
further
pursuit
.
<EOS>
I
mean
the
injustice
of
endeavour
to
supplant
another
in
a
heart
of
which
he
seem
already
in
possession
;
but
the
determined
resolution
of
Mr
Western
show
that
,
in
this
case
,
I
shall
,
by
so
do
,
promote
the
happiness
of
every
party
;
not
only
that
of
the
parent
,
who
will
thus
be
preserve
from
the
high
degree
of
misery
,
but
of
both
the
other
,
who
must
be
undo
by
this
match
.
<EOS>
the
lady
,
I
be
sure
,
will
be
undo
in
every
sense
;
for
,
besides
the
loss
of
most
part
of
her
own
fortune
,
she
will
be
not
only
married
to
a
beggar
,
but
the
little
fortune
which
her
father
can
not
withhold
from
her
will
be
squander
on
that
wench
with
whom
I
know
he
yet
converse
.
<EOS>
nay
,
that
be
a
trifle
;
for
I
know
him
to
be
one
of
the
bad
man
in
the
world
;
for
have
my
dear
uncle
know
what
I
have
hitherto
endeavour
to
conceal
,
he
must
have
long
since
abandon
<EOS>
so
profligate
a
wretch
.
"
<EOS>
"
how
!
"
say
Allworthy
;
"
hath
he
do
anything
bad
than
I
already
know
?
<EOS>
tell
me
,
I
beseech
you
?
"
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
reply
Blifil
;
"
it
be
now
past
,
and
perhaps
he
may
have
repent
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
command
you
,
on
your
duty
,
"
say
Allworthy
,
"
to
tell
me
what
you
mean
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
sir
,
"
say
Blifil
,
"
I
never
disobey
you
;
but
I
be
sorry
I
mention
it
,
since
it
may
now
look
like
revenge
,
whereas
,
I
thank
Heaven
,
no
such
motive
ever
enter
my
heart
;
and
if
you
oblige
me
to
discover
it
,
I
must
be
his
petitioner
to
you
for
your
forgiveness
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
will
have
no
condition
,
"
answer
Allworthy
;
"
I
think
I
have
show
tenderness
enough
towards
him
,
and
more
perhaps
than
you
ought
to
thank
me
for
.
"
<EOS>
"
More
,
indeed
,
I
fear
,
than
he
deserve
,
"
cry
Blifil
;
"
for
in
the
very
day
of
your
utmost
danger
,
when
myself
and
all
the
family
be
in
tear
,
he
fill
the
house
with
riot
and
debauchery
.
<EOS>
He
drink
,
and
sung
,
and
roar
;
and
when
I
give
him
a
gentle
hint
of
the
indecency
of
his
action
,
he
fall
into
a
violent
passion
,
swear
many
oath
,
call
me
rascal
,
and
strike
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
how
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Allworthy
;
"
do
he
dare
to
strike
you
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
"
cry
Blifil
,
"
I
have
forgive
him
that
long
ago
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
so
easily
forget
his
ingratitude
to
the
good
of
benefactor
;
and
yet
even
that
I
hope
you
will
forgive
him
,
since
he
must
have
certainly
be
possess
with
the
devil
:
for
that
very
evening
,
as
Mr
Thwackum
and
myself
be
take
the
air
in
the
field
,
and
exult
in
the
good
symptom
which
then
first
begin
to
discover
themselves
,
we
unluckily
see
him
engage
with
a
wench
in
a
manner
<EOS>
not
fit
to
be
mention
.
<EOS>
Mr
Thwackum
,
with
more
boldness
than
prudence
,
advance
to
rebuke
him
,
when
(
I
be
sorry
to
say
it
)
<EOS>
he
fall
upon
the
worthy
man
,
and
beat
him
so
outrageously
that
I
wish
he
may
have
yet
recover
the
bruise
.
<EOS>
nor
be
I
without
my
share
of
the
effect
of
his
malice
,
while
I
endeavour
to
protect
my
tutor
;
but
that
I
have
long
forgive
;
nay
,
I
prevail
with
Mr
Thwackum
to
forgive
him
too
,
and
not
to
inform
you
of
a
secret
which
I
fear
may
be
fatal
to
him
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
sir
,
since
I
have
unadvisedly
drop
a
hint
of
this
matter
,
and
your
command
have
oblige
me
to
discover
the
whole
,
let
me
intercede
with
you
for
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
o
child
!
"
say
Allworthy
,
"
I
know
not
whether
I
should
blame
or
applaud
your
goodness
,
in
conceal
such
villany
a
moment
:
<EOS>
but
where
be
Mr
Thwackum
?
<EOS>
not
that
I
want
any
confirmation
of
what
you
say
;
but
I
will
examine
all
the
evidence
of
this
matter
,
to
justify
to
the
world
the
example
I
be
resolve
to
make
of
such
a
monster
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Thwackum
be
now
send
for
,
and
presently
appear
.
<EOS>
He
corroborate
every
circumstance
which
the
other
have
depose
;
nay
,
he
produce
the
record
upon
his
breast
,
where
the
handwriting
of
Mr
Jones
remain
very
legible
in
black
and
blue
.
<EOS>
He
conclude
with
declare
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
that
he
should
have
long
since
inform
him
of
this
matter
,
have
not
Mr
Blifil
,
by
the
most
earnest
interposition
,
prevent
him
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
,
"
say
he
,
"
an
excellent
youth
:
though
such
forgiveness
of
enemy
be
carry
the
matter
too
far
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
reality
,
Blifil
have
take
some
pain
to
prevail
with
the
parson
,
and
to
prevent
the
discovery
at
that
time
;
for
which
he
have
many
reason
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
the
mind
of
man
be
apt
to
be
soften
and
relaxed
from
their
usual
severity
by
sickness
.
<EOS>
besides
,
he
imagine
that
if
the
story
be
tell
when
the
fact
be
so
recent
,
and
the
physician
about
the
house
,
who
may
have
unravel
the
real
truth
,
he
should
never
be
able
to
give
it
the
malicious
turn
which
he
intend
.
<EOS>
again
,
he
resolve
to
hoard
up
this
business
,
till
the
indiscretion
of
Jones
should
afford
some
additional
complaint
;
for
he
think
the
joint
weight
of
many
fact
fall
upon
him
together
,
would
be
the
most
likely
to
crush
him
;
and
he
watch
,
therefore
,
some
such
opportunity
as
that
with
which
fortune
have
now
kindly
present
him
.
<EOS>
lastly
,
by
prevail
with
Thwackum
to
conceal
the
matter
for
a
time
,
he
know
he
should
confirm
an
opinion
of
his
friendship
to
Jones
,
which
he
have
greatly
labour
to
establish
in
Mr
Allworthy
.
    
<EOS>
a
short
chapter
;
but
which
contain
sufficient
matter
to
affect
the
good
-
natured
reader
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Mr
Allworthy
's
custom
never
to
punish
any
one
,
not
even
to
turn
away
a
servant
,
in
a
passion
.
<EOS>
He
resolve
therefore
to
delay
pass
sentence
on
Jones
till
the
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
young
man
attend
at
dinner
,
as
usual
;
but
his
heart
be
too
much
load
to
suffer
him
to
eat
.
<EOS>
His
grief
too
be
a
good
deal
aggravate
by
the
unkind
look
of
Mr
Allworthy
;
whence
he
conclude
that
Western
have
discover
the
whole
affair
between
him
and
Sophia
;
but
as
to
Mr
Blifil
's
story
,
he
have
not
the
least
apprehension
;
for
of
much
the
great
part
he
be
entirely
innocent
;
and
for
the
residue
,
as
he
have
forgive
and
forget
it
himself
,
so
he
suspect
no
remembrance
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
when
dinner
be
over
,
and
the
servant
depart
,
Mr
Allworthy
begin
to
harangue
.
<EOS>
He
set
forth
,
in
a
long
speech
,
the
many
iniquity
of
which
Jones
have
be
guilty
,
particularly
those
which
this
day
have
bring
to
light
;
and
conclude
by
tell
him
,
"
that
unless
he
could
clear
himself
of
the
charge
,
he
be
resolve
to
banish
him
his
sight
for
ever
.
"
  
<EOS>
many
disadvantage
attend
poor
Jones
in
make
his
defence
;
nay
,
indeed
,
he
hardly
know
his
accusation
;
for
as
Mr
Allworthy
,
in
recount
the
drunkenness
,
&
c.
,
while
he
lie
ill
,
out
of
modesty
sink
everything
that
relate
particularly
to
himself
,
which
indeed
principally
constitute
the
crime
;
Jones
could
not
deny
the
charge
.
<EOS>
His
heart
be
,
besides
,
almost
broken
already
;
and
his
spirit
be
so
sink
,
that
he
could
say
nothing
for
himself
;
but
acknowledge
the
whole
,
and
,
like
a
criminal
in
despair
,
throw
himself
upon
mercy
;
conclude
,
"
that
though
he
must
own
himself
guilty
of
many
folly
and
inadvertency
,
he
hope
he
have
do
nothing
to
deserve
what
would
be
to
him
the
great
punishment
in
the
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
answer
,
"
that
he
have
forgive
him
too
often
already
,
in
compassion
to
his
youth
,
and
in
hope
of
his
amendment
:
that
he
now
find
he
be
an
abandon
reprobate
,
and
<EOS>
such
as
it
would
be
criminal
in
any
one
to
support
and
encourage
.
<EOS>
nay
,
"
say
Mr
Allworthy
to
him
,
"
your
audacious
attempt
to
steal
away
the
young
lady
,
call
upon
me
to
justify
my
own
character
in
punish
you
.
<EOS>
the
world
who
have
already
censure
the
regard
I
have
show
for
you
may
think
,
with
some
colour
at
least
of
justice
,
that
I
connive
at
so
base
and
barbarous
an
action
 
<EOS>
an
action
of
which
you
must
have
know
my
abhorrence
:
and
which
,
have
you
have
any
concern
for
my
ease
and
honour
,
as
well
as
for
my
friendship
<EOS>
,
you
would
never
have
think
of
undertaking
.
<EOS>
fie
upon
it
,
young
man
!
<EOS>
indeed
there
be
scarce
any
punishment
equal
to
your
crime
,
and
I
can
scarce
think
myself
justifiable
in
what
I
be
now
go
to
bestow
on
you
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
I
have
educate
you
like
a
child
of
my
own
,
I
will
not
turn
you
naked
into
the
world
.
<EOS>
when
you
open
this
paper
,
therefore
,
you
will
find
something
which
may
enable
you
,
with
industry
,
to
get
an
honest
livelihood
;
but
if
you
employ
it
to
bad
purpose
,
I
shall
not
think
myself
oblige
to
supply
you
farther
,
be
resolve
,
from
this
day
forward
,
to
converse
no
more
with
you
on
any
account
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
avoid
say
,
there
be
no
part
of
your
conduct
which
I
resent
more
than
your
ill
-
treatment
of
that
good
young
man
(
mean
Blifil
)
who
hath
behave
with
so
much
tenderness
and
honour
towards
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
these
last
word
be
a
dose
almost
too
bitter
to
be
swallow
.
<EOS>
a
flood
of
tear
now
gush
from
the
eye
of
Jones
,
and
every
faculty
of
speech
and
motion
seem
to
have
desert
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
some
time
before
he
be
able
to
obey
Allworthy
's
peremptory
command
of
departing
;
which
he
at
length
do
,
have
first
kiss
his
hand
with
a
passion
difficult
to
be
affect
,
and
as
difficult
to
be
describe
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
must
be
very
weak
,
if
,
when
he
consider
the
light
in
which
Jones
then
appear
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
he
should
blame
the
rigour
of
his
sentence
.
<EOS>
and
yet
all
the
neighbourhood
,
either
from
this
weakness
,
or
from
some
bad
motive
,
condemn
this
justice
and
severity
as
the
high
cruelty
.
<EOS>
nay
,
the
very
person
who
have
before
censure
the
good
man
for
the
kindness
and
tenderness
show
to
a
bastard
(
his
own
,
accord
to
the
general
opinion
)
,
now
cry
out
as
loudly
against
turn
his
own
child
out
of
door
.
<EOS>
the
woman
especially
be
unanimous
in
take
the
part
of
Jones
,
and
raise
more
story
on
the
occasion
than
I
have
room
,
in
this
chapter
,
to
set
down
.
  
<EOS>
one
thing
must
not
be
omit
,
that
,
in
their
censure
on
this
occasion
,
none
ever
mention
the
sum
contain
in
the
paper
which
Allworthy
give
Jones
,
which
be
no
less
than
five
hundred
pound
;
but
all
agree
that
he
be
send
away
penniless
,
and
some
say
naked
,
from
the
house
of
his
inhuman
father
.
    
<EOS>
contain
love
-
letter
,
&
c.
 
Jones
be
command
to
leave
the
house
immediately
,
and
tell
,
that
his
clothe
and
everything
else
should
be
send
to
him
whithersoever
he
should
order
them
.
  
<EOS>
He
accordingly
set
out
,
and
walk
above
a
mile
,
not
regard
,
and
indeed
scarce
knowing
,
whither
he
go
.
<EOS>
at
length
a
little
brook
obstruct
his
passage
,
he
throw
himself
down
by
the
side
of
it
;
nor
could
he
help
mutter
with
some
little
indignation
,
"
sure
my
father
will
not
deny
me
this
place
to
rest
in
!
"
  
<EOS>
here
he
presently
fall
into
the
most
violent
agony
,
tear
his
hair
from
his
head
,
and
use
most
other
action
which
generally
accompany
fit
of
madness
,
rage
,
and
despair
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
in
this
manner
vent
the
first
emotion
of
passion
,
he
begin
to
come
a
little
to
himself
.
<EOS>
His
grief
now
take
another
turn
,
and
discharge
itself
in
a
gentle
way
,
till
he
become
at
last
cool
enough
to
reason
with
his
passion
,
and
to
consider
what
step
be
proper
to
be
take
in
his
deplorable
condition
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
the
great
doubt
be
,
how
to
act
with
regard
to
Sophia
.
<EOS>
the
thought
of
leave
her
almost
rent
his
heart
asunder
;
but
the
consideration
of
reduce
her
to
ruin
and
beggary
still
rack
him
,
if
possible
,
more
;
and
if
the
violent
desire
of
possess
her
person
could
have
induce
him
to
listen
one
moment
to
this
alternative
,
still
he
be
by
no
means
certain
of
her
resolution
to
indulge
his
wish
at
so
high
an
expense
.
<EOS>
the
resentment
of
Mr
Allworthy
,
and
the
injury
he
must
do
to
his
quiet
,
argue
strongly
against
this
latter
;
and
lastly
,
the
apparent
impossibility
of
his
success
,
even
if
he
would
sacrifice
all
these
consideration
to
it
,
come
to
his
assistance
;
and
thus
honour
at
last
back
with
despair
,
with
gratitude
to
his
benefactor
,
and
with
real
love
to
his
mistress
,
get
the
well
of
burn
desire
,
and
he
resolve
rather
to
quit
Sophia
,
than
pursue
her
to
her
ruin
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
difficult
for
any
who
have
not
feel
it
,
to
conceive
the
glowing
warmth
which
fill
his
breast
on
the
first
contemplation
of
this
victory
over
his
passion
.
<EOS>
pride
flatter
him
so
agreeably
,
that
his
mind
perhaps
enjoy
perfect
happiness
;
but
this
be
only
momentary
:
<EOS>
Sophia
soon
return
to
his
imagination
,
and
allay
the
joy
of
his
triumph
with
no
less
bitter
pang
than
a
good
-
natured
general
must
feel
,
when
he
survey
the
bleeding
heap
,
at
the
price
of
whose
blood
<EOS>
he
hath
purchase
his
laurel
;
for
thousand
of
tender
idea
lie
murder
before
our
conqueror
.
  
<EOS>
be
resolve
,
however
,
to
pursue
the
path
of
this
giant
honour
,
as
the
gigantic
poet
Lee
call
it
,
he
determine
to
write
a
farewel
letter
to
Sophia
;
and
accordingly
proceed
to
a
house
not
far
off
,
where
,
be
furnish
with
proper
material
,
he
write
as
follow
:
      
"
MADAM
,
    
"
<EOS>
when
you
reflect
on
the
situation
in
which
I
write
,
I
be
sure
your
  
good
-
nature
will
pardon
any
inconsistency
or
absurdity
which
my
  
letter
contain
;
for
everything
here
flow
from
a
heart
so
full
,
  
that
no
language
can
express
its
dictate
.
    
<EOS>
"
I
have
resolve
,
madam
,
to
obey
your
command
,
in
fly
for
ever
  
from
your
dear
,
your
lovely
sight
.
<EOS>
cruel
indeed
those
command
be
;
  
but
it
be
a
cruelty
which
proceed
from
fortune
,
not
from
my
Sophia
.
  
<EOS>
Fortune
hath
make
it
necessary
,
necessary
to
your
preservation
,
to
  
forget
there
ever
be
such
a
wretch
as
I
be
.
    
<EOS>
"
believe
me
,
I
would
not
hint
all
my
suffering
to
you
,
if
I
  
imagine
they
could
possibly
escape
your
ear
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
goodness
  
and
tenderness
of
your
heart
,
and
would
avoid
give
you
any
of
  
those
pain
which
you
always
feel
for
the
miserable
.
<EOS>
o
let
nothing
,
  
which
you
shall
hear
of
my
hard
fortune
,
cause
a
moment
's
concern
;
  
for
,
after
the
loss
of
you
,
everything
be
to
me
a
trifle
.
    
<EOS>
"
o
Sophia
!
<EOS>
it
be
hard
to
leave
you
;
it
be
hard
still
to
desire
you
  
to
forget
me
;
yet
the
sincere
love
oblige
me
to
both
.
<EOS>
pardon
my
  
conceive
that
any
remembrance
of
me
can
give
you
disquiet
;
but
if
  
I
be
so
gloriously
wretched
,
sacrifice
me
every
way
to
your
relief
.
  
<EOS>
think
I
never
love
you
;
or
think
truly
how
little
I
deserve
you
;
  
and
learn
to
scorn
me
for
a
presumption
which
can
never
be
too
  
severely
punish
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
unable
to
say
more
.
 
<EOS>
May
guardian
angel
  
protect
you
for
ever

"
  
<EOS>
He
be
now
search
his
pocket
for
his
wax
,
but
find
none
,
nor
indeed
anything
else
,
therein
;
for
in
truth
he
have
,
in
his
frantic
disposition
,
toss
everything
from
him
,
and
amongst
the
rest
,
his
pocket
-
book
,
which
he
have
receive
from
Mr
Allworthy
,
which
he
have
never
open
,
and
which
now
first
occur
to
his
memory
.
  
<EOS>
the
house
supply
him
with
a
wafer
for
his
present
purpose
,
with
which
,
have
seal
his
letter
,
he
return
hastily
towards
the
brook
side
,
in
order
to
search
for
the
thing
which
he
have
there
lose
.
<EOS>
in
his
way
he
meet
his
old
friend
Black
George
,
who
heartily
condole
with
him
on
his
misfortune
;
for
this
have
already
reach
his
ear
,
and
indeed
those
of
all
the
neighbourhood
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
acquaint
the
gamekeeper
with
his
loss
,
and
he
as
readily
go
back
with
him
to
the
brook
,
where
they
search
every
tuft
of
grass
in
the
meadow
,
as
well
where
Jones
have
not
be
as
where
he
have
be
;
but
all
to
no
purpose
,
for
they
find
nothing
;
for
,
indeed
,
though
the
thing
be
then
in
the
meadow
,
they
omit
to
search
the
only
place
where
they
be
deposit
;
to
wit
,
in
the
pocket
of
the
say
George
;
for
he
have
just
before
find
them
,
and
be
luckily
apprize
of
their
value
,
have
very
carefully
put
them
up
for
his
own
use
.
  
<EOS>
the
gamekeeper
have
exert
as
much
diligence
in
quest
of
the
lose
good
,
as
if
he
have
hope
to
find
them
,
desire
Mr
Jones
to
recollect
if
he
have
be
in
no
other
place
:
"
for
sure
,
"
say
he
,
"
if
you
have
lose
them
here
so
lately
,
the
thing
must
have
be
here
still
;
for
this
be
a
very
unlikely
place
for
any
one
to
pass
by
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
indeed
it
be
by
great
accident
that
he
himself
have
pass
through
that
field
,
in
order
to
lay
wire
for
hare
,
with
which
he
be
to
supply
a
poulterer
at
Bath
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
now
give
over
all
hope
of
recover
his
loss
,
and
almost
all
thought
concern
it
,
and
turn
to
Black
George
,
ask
him
earnestly
if
he
would
do
him
the
great
favour
in
the
world
?
  
<EOS>
George
answer
with
some
hesitation
,
"
Sir
,
you
know
you
may
command
me
whatever
be
in
my
power
,
and
I
heartily
wish
it
be
in
my
power
to
do
you
any
service
.
"
<EOS>
in
fact
,
the
question
stagger
him
;
for
he
have
,
by
sell
game
,
amass
a
pretty
good
sum
of
money
in
Mr
Western
's
service
,
and
be
afraid
that
Jones
want
to
borrow
some
small
matter
of
him
;
but
he
be
presently
relieve
from
his
anxiety
,
by
be
desire
to
convey
a
letter
to
Sophia
,
which
with
great
pleasure
he
promise
to
do
.
<EOS>
and
indeed
I
believe
there
be
few
favour
which
he
would
not
have
gladly
confer
on
Mr
Jones
;
for
he
bear
as
much
gratitude
towards
him
as
he
could
,
and
be
as
honest
as
man
who
love
money
well
than
any
other
thing
in
the
universe
,
<EOS>
generally
be
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Honour
be
agree
by
both
to
be
the
proper
mean
by
which
this
letter
should
pass
to
Sophia
.
<EOS>
They
then
separate
;
the
gamekeeper
return
home
to
Mr
Western
's
,
and
Jones
walk
to
an
alehouse
at
half
a
mile
's
distance
,
to
wait
for
his
messenger
's
return
.
  
<EOS>
George
no
sooner
come
home
to
his
master
's
house
than
he
meet
with
Mrs
Honour
;
to
whom
,
have
first
sound
her
with
a
few
previous
question
,
he
deliver
the
letter
for
her
mistress
,
and
receive
at
the
same
time
another
from
her
,
for
Mr
Jones
;
which
Honour
tell
him
she
have
carry
all
that
day
in
her
bosom
,
and
begin
to
despair
of
find
any
mean
of
deliver
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
gamekeeper
return
hastily
and
joyfully
to
Jones
,
who
,
have
receive
Sophia
's
letter
from
him
,
instantly
withdraw
,
and
eagerly
break
it
open
,
read
as
follow
:
      
<EOS>
"
SIR
,
    
"
It
be
impossible
to
express
what
I
have
feel
since
I
see
you
.
<EOS>
Your
  
submitting
,
on
my
account
,
to
such
cruel
insult
from
my
father
,
  
lay
me
under
an
obligation
I
shall
ever
own
.
<EOS>
as
you
know
his
  
temper
,
I
beg
you
will
,
for
my
sake
,
avoid
him
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
any
  
comfort
to
send
you
;
but
believe
this
,
that
nothing
but
the
last
  
violence
shall
ever
give
my
hand
or
heart
where
you
would
be
sorry
  
to
see
them
bestow
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
read
this
letter
a
hundred
time
over
,
and
kiss
it
a
hundred
time
as
often
.
<EOS>
His
passion
now
bring
all
tender
desire
back
into
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
repent
that
he
have
writ
to
Sophia
in
the
manner
we
have
see
above
;
but
he
repent
more
that
he
have
make
use
of
the
interval
of
his
messenger
's
absence
to
write
and
dispatch
a
letter
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
in
which
he
have
faithfully
promise
and
bind
himself
to
quit
all
thought
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
however
,
when
his
cool
reflection
return
,
he
plainly
perceive
that
his
case
be
neither
mend
nor
alter
by
Sophia
's
billet
,
unless
to
give
him
some
little
glimpse
of
hope
,
from
her
constancy
,
of
some
favourable
accident
hereafter
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
resume
his
resolution
,
and
take
leave
of
Black
George
,
set
forward
to
a
town
about
five
mile
distant
,
whither
he
have
desire
Mr
Allworthy
,
unless
he
please
to
revoke
his
sentence
,
to
send
his
thing
after
him
.
    
<EOS>
the
behaviour
of
Sophia
on
the
present
occasion
;
which
none
of
her
sex
will
blame
,
who
be
capable
of
behave
in
the
same
manner
.
<EOS>
and
the
discussion
of
a
knotty
point
in
the
court
of
conscience
.
 
<EOS>
Sophia
have
pass
the
last
twenty
-
four
hour
in
no
very
desirable
manner
.
<EOS>
during
a
large
part
of
them
she
have
be
entertain
by
her
aunt
with
lecture
of
prudence
,
recommend
to
her
the
example
of
the
polite
world
,
where
love
(
so
the
good
lady
say
)
be
at
present
entirely
laugh
at
,
and
where
woman
consider
matrimony
,
as
man
do
office
of
public
trust
,
only
as
the
mean
of
make
their
fortune
,
and
of
advance
themselves
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
in
comment
on
which
text
Mrs
Western
have
display
her
eloquence
during
several
hour
.
  
<EOS>
these
sagacious
lecture
,
though
little
suited
either
to
the
taste
or
inclination
of
Sophia
,
be
,
however
,
less
irksome
to
her
than
her
own
thought
,
that
form
the
entertainment
of
the
night
,
during
which
she
never
once
close
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
she
could
neither
sleep
nor

,
yet

first
give

the
strict

with
great

most
dreadful

be

not

,
and
to

but
she
be

obey

<EOS>
in
the
evening
the

she
receive
from

gamekeeper
.
<EOS>
Sophia
read
it
very
attentively
twice
or
thrice
over
,
and
then
throw
herself
upon
the
bed
,
and
burst
into
a
flood
of
tear
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Honour
express
great
astonishment
at
this
behaviour
in

some
time

start
suddenly
up

find
Black

below

stair
,
deliver
him
the
purse
,
which
contain
sixteen
guinea
,
be
,
indeed
,
the
whole
stock
of
Sophia
;
for
though
her
father
be
very
liberal
to
her
,
she
be
much
too
generous
to
be
rich
.
  
<EOS>
Black
George
have
receive
the
purse
,
set
forward
towards
the
alehouse
;
but
in
the
way
a
thought
occur
to
him
,
whether
he
should
not
detain
this
money
likewise
.
<EOS>
His
conscience
,
however
,
immediately
start
at
this
suggestion
,
and
begin
to
upbraid
him
with
ingratitude
to
his
benefactor
.
<EOS>
to
this
his
avarice
answer
,
that
his
conscience
should
have
consider
the
matter
before
,
when
he
deprive
poor
Jones
of
his
L500
.
<EOS>
that
have
quietly
acquiesce
in
what
be
of
so
much
great
importance
,
it
be
absurd
,
if
not
downright
hypocrisy
,
to
affect
any
qualm
at
this
trifle
.
<EOS>
in
return
to
which
,
Conscience
,
like
a
good
lawyer
,
attempt
to
distinguish
between
an
absolute
breach
of
trust
,
as
here
,
where
the
good
be
deliver
,
and
a
bare
concealment
of
what
be
find
,
as
in
the
former
case
.
<EOS>
avarice
presently
treat
this
with
ridicule
,
call
it
a
distinction
without
a
difference
,
and
absolutely
insist
that
when
once
all
pretension
of
honour
and
virtue
be
give
up
in
any
one
instance
,
that
there
be
no
precedent
for
resort
to
them
upon
a
second
occasion
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
poor
Conscience
have
certainly
be
defeat
in
the
argument
,
have
not
fear
stept
in
to
her
assistance
,
and
very
strenuously
urge
that
the
real
distinction
between
the
two
action
,
do
not
lie
in
the
different
degree
of
honour
but
of
safety
:
for
that
the
secrete
the
L500
be
a
matter
of
very
little
hazard
;
whereas
the
detain
the
sixteen
guinea
be
liable
to
the
utmost
danger
of
discovery
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
friendly
aid
of
Fear
,
Conscience
obtain
a
compleat
victory
in
the
mind
of
Black
George
,
and
,
after
make
him
a
few
compliment

his
honesty

force
him
to
deliver

BOOK
VII
.
  
<EOS>
contain
three
day
.
    
<EOS>
a
comparison
between
the
world
and
the
stage
.
 
<EOS>
the
world
hath
be
often
compare
to
the
theatre
;
and
many
grave
writer
,
as
well
as
the
poet
,
have
consider
human
life
as
a
great
drama
,
resemble
,
in
almost
every
particular
,
those
scenical
representation
which
Thespis
be
first
report
to
have
invent
,
and
which
have
be
since
receive
with
so
much
approbation
and
delight
in
all
polite
country
.
  
<EOS>
this
think
hath
be
carry
so
far
,
and
be
become
so
general
,
that
some
word
proper
to
the
theatre
,
and
which
be
at
first
metaphorically
apply
to
the
world
,
be
now
indiscriminately
and
literally
speak
of
both
;
thus
stage
and
scene
be
by
common
use
grow
as
familiar
to
us
,
when
we
speak
of
life
in
general
,
as
when
we
confine
ourselves
to
dramatic
performance
:
and
when
transaction
behind
the
curtain
be
mention
,
St
James
's
be
more
likely
to
occur
to
our
thought
than
Drury
-
lane
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
seem
easy
enough
to
account
for
all
this
,
by
reflect
that
the
theatrical
stage
be
nothing
more
than
a
representation
,
or
,
as
Aristotle
call
it
,
an
imitation
of
what
really
exist
;
and
hence
,
perhaps
,
we
may
fairly
pay
a
very
high
compliment
to
those
who
by
their
writing
or
action
have
be
so
capable
of
imitate
life
,
as
to
have
their
picture
in
a
manner
confound
with
,
or
mistake
for
,
the
original
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
in
reality
,
we
be
not
so
fond
of
pay
compliment
to
these
people
,
whom
we
use
as
child
frequently
do
the
instrument
of
their
amusement
;
and
have
much
more
pleasure
in
hiss
and
buffet
them
,
than
in
admire
their
excellence
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
other
reason
which
have
induce
us
to
see
this
analogy
between
the
world
and
the
stage
.
  
<EOS>
some
have
consider
the
large
part
of
mankind
in
the
light
of
actor
,
as
personate
character
no
more
their
own
,
and
to
which
in
fact
they
have
no
well
title
,
than
the
player
hath
to
be
in
earnest
think
the
king
or
emperor
whom
he
represent
.
<EOS>
thus
the
hypocrite
may
be
say
to
be
a
player
;
and
indeed
the
Greeks
call
them
both
by
one
and
the
same
name
.
  
<EOS>
the
brevity
of
life
hath
likewise
give
occasion
to
this
comparison
.
<EOS>
so
the
immortal
Shakespear
           
L
ife
be
a
poor
player
,
      
<EOS>
that
strut
and
fret
his
hour
upon
the
stage
,
      
<EOS>
and
then
be
hear
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
for
which
hackneye
quotation
I
will
make
the
reader
amend
by
a
very
noble
one
,
which
few
,
I
believe
,
have
read
.
<EOS>
It
be
take
from
a
poem
call
the
Deity
,
publish
about
nine
year
ago
,
and
long
since
bury
in
oblivion
;
<EOS>
a
proof
that
good

<EOS>
in
all
these
,
however
,
and
in
every
other
similitude
of
life
to
the
theatre
,
the
resemblance
hath
be
always
take
from
the
stage
only
.
<EOS>
none
,
as
I
remember
,
have
at
all
consider
the
audience
at
this
great
drama
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
Nature
often
exhibit
some
of
her
good
performance
to
a
very
full
house
,
so
will
the
behaviour
of
her
spectator
no
less
admit
the
above
-
mention
comparison
than
that
of
her
actor
.
<EOS>
in
this
vast
theatre
of
time
be
seat
the
friend
and
the
critic
;
here
be
clap
and
shout
,
hiss
and
groan
;
in
short
,
everything
which
be
ever
see
or
hear
at
the
Theatre
-
Royal
.
  
<EOS>
let
us
examine
this
in
one
example
;
for
instance
,
in
the
behaviour
of
the
great
audience
on
that
scene
which
Nature
be
pleased
to
exhibit
in
the
twelfth
chapter
of
the
precede
book
,
where
she
introduce
Black
George
run
away
with
the
L500
from
his
friend
and
benefactor
.
  
<EOS>
those
who
sit
in
the
world
's
upper
gallery
treat
that
incident
,
I
be
well
convinced
,
with
their
usual
vociferation
;
and
every
term
of
scurrilous
reproach
be
most
probably
vent
on
that
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
if
we
have
descend
to
the
next
order
of
spectator
,
we
should
have
find
an
equal
degree
of
abhorrence
,
though
less
of
noise
and
scurrility
;
yet
here
the
good
woman
give
Black
George
to
the
devil
,
and
many
of
them
expect
every
minute
that
the
cloven
-
foot
gentleman
would
fetch
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
the
pit
,
as
usual
,
be
no
doubt
divided
;
those
who
delight
in
heroic
virtue
and
perfect
character
object
to
the
produce
such
instance
of
villany
,
without
punish
them
very
severely
for
the
sake
of
example
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
author
's
friend
cry
,
"
Look'e
,
gentleman
,
the
man
be
a
villain
,
but
it
be
nature
for
all
that
.
"
<EOS>
and
all
the
young
critic
of
the
age
,
the
clerk
,
apprentice
,
&
c.
,
call
it
low
,
and
fall
a
groaning
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
the
box
,
they
behave
with
their
accustomed
politeness
.
<EOS>
Most
of
them
be
attend
to
something
else
.
<EOS>
some
of
those
few
who
regard
the
scene
at
all
,
declare
he
be
a
bad
kind
of
man
;
while
other
refuse
to
give
their
opinion
,
till
they
have
hear
that
of
the
good
judge
.
  
<EOS>
now
we
,
who
be
admit
behind
the
scene
of
this
great
theatre
of
Nature
(
and
no
author
ought
to
write
anything
besides
dictionary
and
spelling
-
book
who
hath
not
this
privilege
)
,
can
censure
the
action
,
without
conceive
any
absolute
detestation
of
the
person
,
whom
perhaps
Nature
may
not
have
design
to
act
an
ill
part
in
all
her
drama
;
for
in
this
instance
life
most
exactly
resemble
the
stage
,
since
it
be
often
the
same
person
who
represent
the
villain
and
the
heroe
;
and
he
who
engage
your
admiration
to
-
day
will
probably
attract
your
contempt
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
as
Garrick
,
whom
I
regard
in
tragedy
to
be
the
great
genius
the
world
hath
ever
produce
,
sometimes
condescend
to
play
the
fool
;
so
do
Scipio
the
great
,
and
Laelius
the
Wise
,
accord
to
Horace
,
many
year
ago
;
nay
,
Cicero
report
them
to
have
be
"
incredibly
childish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
these
,
it
be
true
,
play
the
fool
,
like
my
friend
Garrick
,
in
jest
only
;
but
several
eminent
character
have
,
in
numberless
instance
of
their
life
,
play
the
fool
egregiously
in
earnest
;
so
far
as
to
render
it
a
matter
of
some
doubt
whether
their
wisdom
or
folly
be
predominant
;
or
whether
they
be
better
intitle
to
the
applause
or
censure
,
the
admiration
or
contempt
,
the
love
or
hatred
,
of
mankind
.
  
<EOS>
those
person
,
indeed
,
who
have
pass
any
time
behind
the
scene
of
this
great
theatre
,
and
be
thoroughly
acquaint
not
only
with
the
several
disguise
which
be
there
put
on
,
but
also
with
the
fantastic
and
capricious
behaviour
of
the
Passions
,
who
be
the
manager
and
director
of
this
theatre
(
for
as
to
Reason
,
the
patentee
,
he
be
know
to
be
a
very
idle
fellow
and
seldom
to
exert
himself
)
,
may
most
probably
have
learn
to
understand
the
famous
nil
admirari
of
Horace
,
or
in
the
english
phrase
,
to
stare
at
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
a
single
bad
act
no
more
constitute
a
villain
in
life
,
than
a
single
bad
part
on
the
stage
.
<EOS>
the
passion
,
like
the
manager
of
a
playhouse
,
often
force
man
upon
part
without
consult
their
judgment
,
and
sometimes
without
any
regard
to
their
talent
.
<EOS>
thus
the
man
,
as
well
as
the
player
,
may
condemn
what
he
himself
act
;
nay
,
it
be
common
to
see
vice
sit
as
awkwardly
on
some
man
,
as
the
character
of
Iago
would
on
the
honest
face
of
Mr
William
Mills
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
then
,
the
man
of
candour
and
of
true
understanding
be
never
hasty
to
condemn
.
<EOS>
He
can
censure
an
imperfection
,
or
even
a
vice
,
without
rage
against
the
guilty
party
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
they
be
the
same
folly
,
the
same
childishness
,
the
same
ill
-
breeding
,
and
the
same
ill
-
nature
,
which
raise
all
the
clamour
and
uproar
both
in
life
and
on
the
stage
.
<EOS>
the
bad
of
man
generally
have
the
word
rogue
and
villain
most
in
their
mouth
,
as
the
low
of
all
wretch
be
the
apt
to
cry
out
low
in
the
pit
.
    
<EOS>
contain
a
conversation
which
Mr
Jones
have
with
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Jones
receive
his
effect
from
Mr
Allworthy
's
early
in
the
morning
,
with
the
follow
answer
to
his
letter
:
      
<EOS>
"
SIR

"
I
be
command
by
my
uncle
to
acquaint
you
,
that
as
he
do
not
  
proceed
to
those
measure
he
have
take
with
you
,
without
the
  
great
deliberation
,
and
after
the
full
evidence
of
your
  
unworthiness
,
so
will
it
be
always
out
of
your
power
to
cause
the
  
least
alteration
in
his
resolution
.
<EOS>
He
express
great
surprize
at
  
your
presumption
in
say
you
have
resign
all
pretension
to
a
  
young
lady
,
to
whom
it
be
impossible
you
should
ever
have
have
any

<EOS>
her
birth
and
fortune
have
make
her
so
infinitely
your

<EOS>
lastly
,
I
be
command
to
tell
you
,
that
the
only
instance
of
your
  
compliance
with
my
uncle
's
inclination
which
he
require
,
be
,
your
  
immediately
quit
this
country
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
conclude
this
without
  
offer
you
my
advice
,
as
a
Christian
,
that
you
would
seriously
  
think
of
amend
your
life
.
<EOS>
that
you
may
be
assist
with
grace
so
  
to
do
,
will
be
always
the
prayer
of

Your

<EOS>
many
contend
passion
be
raise
in
our
heroe
's
mind
by
this
letter
;
but
the
tender
prevail
at
last
over
the
indignant
and
irascible
,
and
a
flood
of
tear
come
seasonably
to
his
assistance
,
and
possibly
prevent
his
misfortune
from
either
turn
his
head
,
or
burst
his
heart
.
  
<EOS>
He
grow
,
however
,
soon
ashamed
of
indulge
this
remedy
;
and
start
up
,
he
cry
,
"
well
,
then
,
I
will
give
Mr
Allworthy
the
only
instance
he
require
of
my
obedience
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
this
moment
 
but
whither
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
let
Fortune
direct
;
since
there
be
no
other
who
think
it
of
any
consequence
what
become
of
this
wretched
person
,
it
shall
be
a
matter
of
equal
indifference
to
myself
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
alone
regard
what
no
other
 
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
have
<EOS>
I
not
reason
to
think
there
be
another
?
 
<EOS>
one
whose
value
be
above
that
of
the
whole
world
!
 
<EOS>
I
may
<EOS>
,
I
must
imagine
my
Sophia
be
not
indifferent
to
what
become
of
me
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
then
leave
this
only
friend
 
and
such
a
friend
?
<EOS>
Shall
I
not
stay
with
her

<EOS>
where
 
how
can
I
stay
with
her
?
<EOS>
have
I
any
hope
of
ever
see
her
,
though
she
be
as
desirous
as
myself
,
without
expose
her
to
the
wrath
of
her
father
,
and
to
what
purpose
?
<EOS>
Can
I
think
of
solicit
such
a

to
consent
to
her

ruin

<EOS>
Shall
I
indulge
any

<EOS>
Shall
I
lurk
about

<EOS>
no

I

I

<EOS>
here
passion
stop
his
mouth
,
and
find
a
vent
at
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
have
take
a
resolution
to
leave
the
country
,
he
begin
to
debate
with
himself
whither
he
should
go
.
<EOS>
the
world
,
as
Milton
phrase
it
,
lie
all
before
him
;
and
Jones
,
no
more
than
Adam
,
have
any
man
to
whom
he
may
resort
for
comfort
or
assistance
.
<EOS>
all
his
acquaintance
be
the
acquaintance
of
Mr
Allworthy
;
and
he
have
no
reason
to
expect
any
countenance
from
them
,
as
that
gentleman
have
withdraw
his
favour
from
him
.
<EOS>
man
of
great
and
good
character
should
indeed
be
very
cautious
how
they
discard
their
dependent
;
for
the
consequence
to
the
unhappy
sufferer
be
be
discard
by
all
other
.
  
<EOS>
what
course
of
life
to
pursue
,
or
to
what
business
to
apply
himself
,
be
a
second
consideration
:
and
here
the
prospect
be
all
a
melancholy
void
.
<EOS>
every
profession
,
and
every
trade
,
require
length
of
time
,
and
what
be
bad
,
money
;
for
matter
be
so
constituted
,
that
"
nothing
out
of
nothing
"
be
not
a
true
maxim
in
physics
than
in
politic
;
and
every
man
who
be
greatly
destitute
of
money
,
be
on
that
account
entirely
exclude
from
all
mean
of
acquire
it
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
the
Ocean
,
that
hospitable
friend
to
the
wretched
,
open
her
capacious
arm
to
receive
him
;
and
he
instantly
resolve
to
accept
her
kind
invitation
.
<EOS>
to
express
myself
less
figuratively
,
he
determine
to
go
to
sea
.
  
<EOS>
this
thought
indeed
no
sooner
suggest
itself
,
than
he
eagerly
embrace
it
;
and
have
presently
hire
horse
,
he
set
out
for
Bristol
to
put
it
in
execution
.
  
<EOS>
but
before
we
attend
him
on
this
expedition
,
we
shall
resort
awhile
to
Mr
Western
's
,
and
see
what
further
happen
to
the
charming
Sophia
.
    
<EOS>
contain
several
dialogue
.
 
<EOS>
the
morning
in
which
Mr
Jones
depart
,
Mrs
Western
summon
Sophia
into
her
apartment
;
and
have
first
acquaint
her
that
she
have
obtain
her
liberty
of
her
father
,
she
proceed
to
read
her
a
long
lecture
on
the
subject
of
matrimony
;
which
she
treat
not
as
a
romantic
scheme
of
happiness
arise
from
love
,
as
it
hath
be
describe
by
the
poet
;
nor
do
she
mention
any
of
those
purpose
for
which
we
be
teach
by
divine
to
regard
it
as
institute
by
sacred
authority
;
she
consider
it
rather
as
a
fund
in
which
prudent
woman
deposit
their
fortune
to
the
good
advantage
,
in
order
to
receive
a
large
interest
for
them
than
they
could
have
elsewhere
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mrs
Western
have
finish
,
Sophia
answer
,
"
that
she
be
very
incapable
of
argue
with
a
lady
of
her
aunt
's
superior
knowledge
and
experience
,
especially
on
a
subject
which
she
have
so
very
little
consider
,
as
this
of
matrimony
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
argue
with
me
,
child
!
"
reply
the
other
;
"
I
do
not
indeed
expect
it
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
see
the
world
to
very
little
purpose
truly
,
if
I
be
to
argue
with
one
of
your
year
.
<EOS>
I
have
take
this
trouble
,
in
order
to
instruct
you
.
<EOS>
the
antient
philosopher
,
such
as
Socrates
,
Alcibiades
,
and
other
,
do
not
use
to
argue
with
their
scholar
.
<EOS>
You
be
to
consider
me
,
child
,
as
Socrates
,
not
ask
your
opinion
,
but
only
inform
you
of
mine
.
"
<EOS>
from
which
last
word
the
reader
may
possibly
imagine
,
that
this
lady
have
read
no
more
of
the
philosophy
of
Socrates
,
than
she
have
of
that
of
Alcibiades
;
and
indeed
we
can
not
resolve
his
curiosity
as
to
this
point
.
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
cry
Sophia
,
"
I
have
never
presume
to
controvert
any
opinion
of
yours
;
and
this
subject
,
as
I
say
,
I
have
never
yet
think
of
,
and
perhaps
never
may
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
Sophy
,
"
reply
the
aunt
,
"
this
dissimulation
with
me
be
very
foolish
.
<EOS>
the
French
shall
as
soon
persuade
me
that
they
take
foreign
town
in
defence
only
of
their
own
country
,
as
you
can
impose
on
me
to
believe
you
have
never
yet
think
seriously
of
matrimony
.
<EOS>
how
can
you
,
child
,
affect
to
deny
that
you
have
consider
of
contract
an
alliance
,
when
you
so
well
know
I
be
acquaint
with
the
party
with
whom
you
desire
to
contract
it
?
 
<EOS>
an
alliance
as
unnatural
,
and
contrary
to
your
interest
,
as
a
separate
league
with
the
French
would
be
to
the
interest
of
the
Dutch
!
<EOS>
but
however
,
if
you
have
not

by

you

very

never
beat
her

have
not
the

occasion
for
jealousy

it

go
out
after

obedience
to

be
seldom
such

the
sporting
season
he
always
rise
from
her
before
it
be
light
.
<EOS>
thus
be
she
perfect
mistress
of
her
time
,
and
have
besides
a
coach
and
four
usually
at
her
command
;
though
unhappily
,
indeed
,
the
badness
of
the
neighbourhood
,
and
of
the
road
,
make
this
of
little
use
;
for
none
who
have
set
much
value
on
their
neck
would
have
pass
through
the
one
,
or
who
have
set
any
value
on
their
hour
,
would
have
visit
the
other
.
<EOS>
now
to
deal
honestly
with
the
reader
,
she
do
not
make
all
the
return
expect
to
so
much
indulgence
;
for
she
have
be
marry
against
her
will
by
a
fond
father
,
the
match
have
be
rather
advantageous
on
her
side
;
for
the
squire
's
estate
be
upward
of
L3000
a
year
,
and
her
fortune
no
more
than
a
bare
l8000
.
<EOS>
hence
perhaps
she
have
contract
a
little
gloominess
of
temper
,
for
she
be
rather
a
good
servant
than
a
good
wife
;
nor
have
she
always
the
gratitude
to
return
the
extraordinary
degree
of
roar
mirth
,
with
which
the
squire
receive
her
,
even
with
a
good
-
humoured
smile
.
<EOS>
She
would
,
moreover
,
sometimes
interfere
with
matter
which
do
not
concern
her
,
as
the
violent
drinking
of
her
husband
,
which
in
the
gentle
term
she
would
take
some
of
the
few
opportunity
he
give
her
of
remonstrate
against
.
<EOS>
and
once
in
her
life
she
very
earnestly
entreat
him
to
carry
her
for
two
month
to
London
,
which
he
peremptorily
deny
;
nay
,
be
angry
with
his
wife
for
the
request
ever
after
,
be
well
assure
that
all
the
husband
in
London
be
cuckold
.
  
<EOS>
for
this
last
,
and
many
other
good
reason
,
western
at
length
heartily
hate
his
wife
;
and
as
he
never
conceal
this
hatred
before
her
death
,
so
he
never
forget
it
afterwards
;
but
when
anything
in
the
least
sour
him
,
as
a
bad
scenting
day
,
or
a
distemper
among
his
hound
,
or
any
other
such
misfortune
,
he
constantly
vent
his
spleen
by
invective
against
the
deceased
,
say
,
"
if
my
wife
be
alive
now
,
she
would
be
glad
of
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
these
invective
<EOS>
he
be
especially
desirous
of
throw
forth
before
Sophia
;
for
as
he
love
her
more
than
he
do
any
other
,
so
he
be
really
jealous
that
she
have
love
her
mother
better
than
him
.
<EOS>
and
this
jealousy
Sophia
seldom
fail
of
heighten
on
these
occasion
;
for
he
be
not
content
with
violate
her
ear
with
the
abuse
of
her
mother
,
but
endeavour
to
force
an
explicit
approbation
of
all
this
abuse
;
with
which
desire
he
never
could
prevail
upon
her
by
any
promise
or
threat
to
comply
.
  
<EOS>
hence
some
of
my
reader
will
,
perhaps
,
wonder
that
the
squire
have
not
hate
Sophia
as
much
as
he
have
hate
her
mother
;
but
I
must
inform
them
,
that
hatred
be
not
the
effect
of
love
,
even
through
the
medium
of
jealousy
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
indeed
,
very
possible
for
jealous
person
to
kill
the
object
of
their
jealousy
,
but
not
to
hate
them
.
<EOS>
which
sentiment
be
a
pretty
hard
morsel
,
and
bear
something
of
the
air
of
a
paradox
,
we
shall
leave
the
reader
to
chew
the
cud
upon
it
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
the
generous
behaviour
of
Sophia
towards
her
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
Sophia
keep
silence
during
the
foregoing
speech
of
her
father
,
nor
do
she
once
answer
otherwise
than
with
a
sigh
;
but
as
he
understand
none
of
the
language
,
or
,
as
he
call
it
,
lingo
of
the
eye
,
so
he
be
not
satisfied
without
some
further
approbation
of
his
sentiment
,
which
he
now
demand
of
his
daughter
;
tell
her
,
in
the
usual
way
,
"
he
expect
she
be
ready
to
take
the
part
of
everybody
against
him
,
as
she
have
always
do
that
of
the
b
#
#
#
#
her
mother
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sophia
remain
still
silent
,
he
cry
out
,
"
what
,
art
dumb
?
<EOS>
why
dost
unt
speak
?
<EOS>
be
not
thy
mother
a
d####d
b

to
me
?
<EOS>
answer
me
that
.
<EOS>
what
,
I
suppose
you
despise
your
father
too
,
and
do
not
think
him
good
enough
to
speak
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
sir
,
"
answer
Sophia
,
"
do
not
give
so
cruel
a
turn
to
my
silence
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
would
sooner
die
than
be
guilty
of
any
disrespect
towards
you
;
but
how
can
I
venture
to
speak
,
when
every
word
must
either
offend
my
dear
papa
,
or
convict
me
of
the
black
ingratitude
as
well
as
impiety
to
the
memory
of
the
good
of
mother
;
for
such
,
I
be
certain
,
my
mamma
be
always
to
me
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
your
aunt
,
I
suppose
,
be
the
good
of
sister
too
!
<EOS>
"
reply
the
squire
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
allow
that
she
be
a
b

?
<EOS>
I
may
fairly
insist
upon
that
,
I
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
indeed
,
sir
,
"
say
Sophia
,
"
I
have
great
obligation
to
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
She
hath
be
a
second
mother
to
me

<EOS>
"
and
a
second
wife
to
me
too

"
return
western
;
"
so
you
will
take
her
part
too
!
<EOS>
You
will
not
confess
that
she
hath
act
the
part
of
the
vile
sister
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
sir
,
"
cry
Sophia
,
"
I
must
belie
my
heart
<EOS>
wickedly
if
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
know
my
aunt
and
you
differ
very
much
in
your
way
of
thinking
;
but
I
have
hear
her
a
thousand
time
express
the
great
affection
for
you
;
and
I
be
convinced
,
so
far
from
her
be
the
bad
sister
in
the
world
,
there
be
very
few
who
love
a
brother
better

"
  
<EOS>
"
the
English
of
all
which
be
,
"
answer
the
squire
,
"
that
I
be
in
the
wrong

<EOS>
ay
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
ay
,
to
be
sure
the
woman
be
in
the
right

and
the
man
in
the
wrong
always

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
pardon
me
,
sir
,
"
cry
Sophia
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
not
you
say
?
"
answer
the
father
:
<EOS>
"
you
have
the
impudence
to
say
she
be
in
the
right
:
doth
it
not
follow
then
of
course
that
I
be
in
the
wrong
?
<EOS>
and
perhaps
I
be
in
the
wrong
to
suffer
such
a
presbyterian
Hanoverian
b
#
#
#
#
to
come
into
my
house

<EOS>
She
may

dite
me
of
a
plot
for
anything
I
know
,
and
give
my
estate
to
the
government

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
far
,
sir

from
injure
you

your
estate

"
say
Sophia
,
"
if
my
aunt
have
die
yesterday
,
I
be
convinced
she
would
have
leave
you
her
whole
fortune
.
"
  
<EOS>
whether
Sophia
intend
it
or
no
,
I
shall
not
presume
to
assert
;
but
certain
it
be
,
these
last
word
penetrate
very
deep
into
the
ear
of
her
father
,
and
produce
a
much
more
sensible
effect
than
all
she
have
say
before
.
<EOS>
He
receive
the
sound
with
much
the
same
action
as
a
man
receive
a
bullet
in
his
head
.
<EOS>
He
start
,
stagger
,
and
turn
pale
.
<EOS>
after
which
he
remain
silent
above
a
minute
,
and
then
begin
in
the
following
hesitating
manner
:
"
yesterday
!
<EOS>
she
would
have
leave
me
her
esteate
yesterday
!
<EOS>
would
she
?
<EOS>
why
yesterday
,
of
all
the
day
in
the
year
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
if
she
die
to
-
morrow
,
she
will
leave
it
to
somebody
else
,
and
perhaps
out
of
the
vamily
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
aunt
,
sir
,
"
cry
Sophia
,
"
hath
very
violent
passion
,
and
I
can
not
answer
what
she
may
do
under
their
influence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
!
"
return
the
father
:
"
and
pray
who
hath
be
the
occasion
of
put
her
into
those
violent
passion
?
<EOS>
Nay
,
who
hath
actually
put
her
into
them
?
<EOS>
be
not
you
and
she
hard
at
it
before
I
come
into
the
room
?
<EOS>
besides
,
be
not
all
our
quarrel
about
you
?
<EOS>
I
have
not
quarrel
with
sister
this
many
year
but
upon
your
account
;
and
now
you
would
throw
the
whole
blame
upon
me
,
as
thof
I
should
be
the
occasion
of
her
leave
the
esteate
out
o
'
the
vamily
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
expect
no
better
indeed
;
this
be
like
the
return
you
make
to
all
the
rest
of
my
fondness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beseech
you
then
,
"
cry
Sophia
,
"
upon
my
knee
I
beseech
you
,
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
the
unhappy
occasion
of
this
difference
,
that
you
will
endeavour
to
make
it
up
with
my
aunt
,
and
not
suffer
her
to
leave
your
house
in
this
violent
rage
of
anger
:
she
be
a
very
good
-
natured
woman
,
and
a
few
civil
word
will
satisfy
her
.
<EOS>
let
me
entreat
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
must
go
and
ask
pardon
for
your
fault
,
must
I
?
"
answer
western
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
lose
the
hare
,
and
I
must
draw
every
way
to
find
her
again
?
<EOS>
indeed
,
if
I
be
certain
"
 
H
ere
he
stopt
,
and
<EOS>
Sophia
throw
in
more
entreaty
,
at
length
prevail
upon
him
;
so
that
after
vent
two
or
three
bitter
sarcastical
expression
against
his
daughter
,
he
depart
as
fast
as
he
could
to
recover
his
sister
,
before
her
equipage
could
be
get
ready
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
then
return
to
her
chamber
of
mourning
,
where
she
indulge
herself
(
if
the
phrase
may
be
allow
me
)
in
all
the
luxury
of
tender
grief
.
<EOS>
She
read
over
more
than
once
the
letter
which
she
have
receive
from
Jones
;
her
muff
too
be
use
on
this
occasion
;
and
she
bathe
both
these
,
as
well
as
herself
,
with
her
tear
.
<EOS>
in
this
situation
the
friendly
Mrs
Honour
exert
her
utmost
ability
to
comfort
her
afflict
mistress
.
<EOS>
She
run
over
the
name
of
many
young
gentleman
:
and
have
greatly
commend
their
part
and
person
,
assure
Sophia
that
she
may
take
her
choice
of
any
.
<EOS>
these
method
must
have
certainly
be
use
with
some
success
in
disorder
of
the
like
kind
,
or
so
skilful
a
practitioner
as
Mrs
Honour
would
never
have
venture
to
apply
them
;
<EOS>
nay
,
I
have
hear
that
the
college
of
chambermaid
hold
them
to
be
as
sovereign
remedy
as
any
in
the
female
dispensary
;
but
whether
it
be
that
Sophia
's
disease
differ
inwardly
from
those
case
with
which
it
agree
in
external
symptom
,
I
will
not
assert
;
but
,
in
fact
,
the
good
waiting
-
woman
do
more
harm
than
good
,
and
at
last
so
incense
her
mistress
(
which
be
no
easy
matter
)
<EOS>
that
with
an
angry
voice
she
dismiss
her
from
her
presence
.
    
<EOS>
contain
great
variety
of
matter
.
 
<EOS>
the
squire
overtook
his
sister
just
as
she
be
step
into
the
coach
,
and
partly
by
force
,
and
partly
by
solicitation
,
prevail
upon
her
to
order
her
horse
back
into
their
quarter
.
<EOS>
He
succeed
in
this
attempt
without
much
difficulty
;
for
the
lady
be
,
as
we
have
already
hint
,
of
a
most
placable
disposition
,
and
greatly
love
her
brother
,
though
she
despise
his
part
,
or
rather
his
little
knowledge
of
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Sophia
,
who
have
first
set
on
foot
this
reconciliation
,
be
now
make
the
sacrifice
to
it
.
<EOS>
They
both
concur
in
their
censure
on
her
conduct
;
jointly
declare
war
against
her
,
and
directly
proceed
to
counsel
,
how
to
carry
it
on
in
the
most
vigorous
manner
.
<EOS>
for
this
purpose
,
Mrs
Western
propose
not
only
an
immediate
conclusion
of
the
treaty
with
Allworthy
,
but
as
immediately
to
carry
it
into
execution
;
say
,
"
that
there
be
no
other
way
to
succeed
with
her
niece
,
but
by
violent
method
,
which
she
be
convince
Sophia
have
not
sufficient
resolution
to
resist
.
<EOS>
by
violent
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
mean
rather
,
hasty
measure
;
for
as
to
confinement
or
absolute
force
,
no
such
thing
must
or
can
be
attempt
.
<EOS>
Our
plan
must
be
concert
for
a
surprize
,
and
not
for
a
storm
.
"
  
<EOS>
these
matter
be
resolve
on
,
when
Mr
Blifil
come
to
pay
a
visit
to
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
the
squire
no
sooner
hear
of
his
arrival
,
than
he
stept
aside
,
by
his
sister
's
advice
,
to
give
his
daughter
order
for
the
proper
reception
of
her
lover
:
<EOS>
which
he
do
with
the
most
bitter
execration
and
denunciation
of
judgment
on
her
refusal
.
  
<EOS>
the
impetuosity
of
the
squire
bear
down
all
before
him
;
and
Sophia
,
as
her
aunt
very
wisely
foresaw
,
be
not
able
to
resist
him
.
<EOS>
She
agree
,
therefore
,
to
see
Blifil
,
though
she
have
scarce
spirit
or
strength
sufficient
to
utter
her
assent
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
to
give
a
peremptory
denial
to
a
father
whom
she
so
tenderly
love
,
be
no
easy
task
.
<EOS>
have
this
circumstance
be
out
of
the
case
,
much
less
resolution
than
what
she
be
really
mistress
of
,
would
,
perhaps
,
have
serve
her
;
but
it
be
no
unusual
thing
to
ascribe
those
action
entirely
to
fear
,
which
be
in
a
great
measure
produce
by
love
.
  
<EOS>
in
pursuance
,
therefore
,
of
her
father
's
peremptory
command
,
Sophia
now
admit
Mr
Blifil
's
visit
.
<EOS>
scene
like
this
,
when
paint
at
large
,
afford
,
as
we
have
observe
,
very
little
entertainment
to
the
reader
.
<EOS>
here
,
therefore
,
we
shall
strictly
adhere
to
a
rule
of
horace
;
by
which
writer
be
direct
to
pass
over
all
those
matter
which
they
despair
of
place
in
a
shine
light
;
 
a
rule
,
we
conceive
,
of
excellent
use
as
well
to
the
historian
as
to
the
poet
;
and
which
,
if
follow
,
must
at
least
have
this
good
effect
,
that
many
a
great
evil
(
for
so
all
great
book
be
call
)
would
thus
be
reduce
to
a
small
one
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
possible
the
great
art
use
by
Blifil
at
this
interview
would
have
prevail
on
Sophia
to
have
make
another
man
in
his
circumstance
her
confident
,
and
to
have
reveal
the
whole
secret
of
her
heart
to
him
;
but
she
have
contract
so
ill
an
opinion
of
this
young
gentleman
,
that
she
be
resolve
to
place
no
confidence
in
him
;
for
simplicity
,
when
set
on
its
guard
,
be
often
a
match
for
cunning
.
<EOS>
Her
behaviour
to
him
,
therefore
,
be
entirely
force
,
and
indeed
such
as
be
generally
prescribe
to
virgin
upon
the
second
formal
visit
from
one
who
be
appoint
for
their
husband
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
Blifil
declare
himself
to
the
squire
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
reception
;
yet
that
gentleman
,
who
,
in
company
with
his
sister
,
have
overhear
all
,
be
not
so
well
pleased
.
<EOS>
He
resolve
,
in
pursuance
of
the
advice
of
the
sage
lady
,
to
push
matter
as
forward
as
possible
;
and
address
himself
to
his
intended
son
-
in
-
law
in
the
hunting
phrase
,
he
cry
,
after
a
loud
holla
,
"
follow
her

boy
,
follow
her
;
run
in

run
in

<EOS>
never

I

<EOS>
Allworthy
and
<EOS>
I
can
finish
all
matter
between
us
this
afternoon
,
and
let
us
ha
'
the
wedding
to

morrow

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Blifil
have
convey
the
utmost
satisfaction
into
his
countenance
,
answer
,
"
as
there
be
nothing
,
sir
,
in
this
world
which
I
so
eagerly
desire
as
an
alliance
with
your
family
,
except
my
union
with
the
most
amiable
and
deserve
Sophia
,
you
may
easily
imagine
how
impatient
I
must
be
to
see
myself
in
possession
of
my
two
high
wish
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
not
therefore
importune
you
on
this
head
,
you
will
impute
it
only
to
my
fear
of
offend
the
lady
,
by
endeavour
to
hurry
on
<EOS>
so
bless
an
event
faster
than
a
strict
compliance
with
all
the
rule
of
decency
and
decorum
will
permit

<EOS>
but
if
,
by
your
interest

she
may
be
induce
to
dispense
with
any

I
tell
thee

never

their

,
if
they

not

<EOS>
if
I
have

for
her

I
may
have
be
a

to

I

"
  
<EOS>
Blifil
suffer
himself
to
be
overpower
by
the
forcible
rhetoric
of
the
squire
;
and
it
be
agree
that
Western
should
close
with
Allworthy
that
very
afternoon
,
the
lover
depart
home
,
have
first
earnestly
beg
that
no
violence
may
be
offer
to
the
lady
by
this
haste
,
in
the
same
manner
as
a
popish
inquisitor
beg
the
lay
power
to
do
no
violence
to
the
heretic
deliver
over
to
it
,
and
against
whom
the
church
hath
pass
sentence
.
  
<EOS>
and
,
to
say
the
truth
,
Blifil
have
pass
sentence
against
Sophia
;
for
,
however
please
he
have
declare
himself
to
Western
with
his
reception
<EOS>
,
he
be
by
no
mean
satisfied
,
unless
it
be
that
he
be
convince
of
the
hatred
and
scorn
of
his
mistress
:
and
this
have
produce
no
less
reciprocal
hatred
and
scorn
in
him
.
<EOS>
It
may
,
perhaps
,
be
ask
,
why
then
do
he
not
put
an
immediate
end
to
all
further
courtship
?
<EOS>
I
answer
,
for
that
very
reason
,
as
well
as
for
several
other
equally
good
,
which
we
shall
now
proceed
to
open
to
the
reader
.
  
<EOS>
though
Mr
Blifil
be
not
of
the
complexion
of
Jones
,
nor
ready
to
eat
every
woman
he
see
;
yet
he
be
far
from
be
destitute
of
that
appetite
which
be
say
to
be
the
common
property
of
all
animal
.
<EOS>
with
this
,
he
have
likewise
that
distinguish
taste
,
which
serve
to
direct
man
in
their
choice
of
the
object
or
food
of
their
several
appetite
;
and
this
teach
him
to
consider
Sophia
as
a
most
delicious
morsel
,
indeed
to
regard
her
with
the
same
desire
which
an
ortolan
inspire
into
the
soul
of
an
epicure
.
<EOS>
now
the
agony
which
affect
the
mind
of
Sophia
,
rather
augment
than
impair
her
beauty
;
for
her
tear
add
brightness
to
her
eye
,
and
her
breast
rise
higher
with
her
sigh
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
no
one
hath
see
beauty
in
its
high
lustre
who
hath
never
see
it
in
distress
.
<EOS>
Blifil
therefore
look
on
this
human
ortolan
with
great
desire
than
when
he
view
her
last
;
nor
be
his
desire
at
all
lessen
by
the
aversion
which
he
discover
in
her
to
himself
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
this
serve
rather
to
heighten
the
pleasure
he
propose
in
rifle
her
charm
,
as
it
add
triumph
to
lust
;
nay
,
he
have
some
further
view
,
from
obtain
the
absolute
possession
of
her
person
,
which
we
detest
too
much
even
to
mention
;
and
revenge
itself
be
not
without
its
share
in
the
gratification
which
he
promise
himself
.
<EOS>
the
rival
poor
Jones
,
and
supplant
him
in
her
affection
,
add
another
spur
to
his
pursuit
,
and
promise
another
additional
rapture
to
his
enjoyment
.
  
<EOS>
besides
all
these
view
,
which
to
some
scrupulous
person
may
seem
to
savour
too
much
of
malevolence
,
he
have
one
prospect
,
which
few
reader
will
regard
with
any
great
abhorrence
.
<EOS>
and
this
be
the
estate
of
Mr
Western
;
which
be
all
to
be
settle
on
his
daughter
and
her
issue
;
for
so
extravagant
be
the
affection
of
that
fond
parent
,
that
,
provide
his
child
would
<EOS>
but
consent
to
be
miserable
with
the
husband
he
choose
,
he
care
not
at
what
price
he
purchase
him
.
  
<EOS>
for
these
reason
Mr
Blifil
be
so
desirous
of
the
match
that
he
intend
to
deceive
Sophia
,
by
pretend
love
to
her
;
and
to
deceive
her
father
and
his
own
uncle
,
by
pretend
he
be
beloved
by
her
.
<EOS>
in
do
this
he
avail
himself
of
the
piety
of
Thwackum
,
who
hold
,
that
if
the
end
propose
be
religious
(
as
surely
matrimony
be
)
<EOS>
,
it
matter
not
how
wicked
be
the
mean
.
<EOS>
as
to
other
occasion
,
he
use
to
apply
the
philosophy
of
Square
,
which
teach
,
that
the
end
be
immaterial
,
so
that
the
mean
be
fair
and
consistent
with
moral
rectitude
.
<EOS>
to
say
truth
,
there
be
few
occurrence
in
life
on
which
he
could
not
draw
advantage
from
the
precept
of
one
or
other
of
those
great
master
.
  
<EOS>
little
deceit
be
indeed
necessary
to
be
practise
on
Mr
Western
;
who
think
the
inclination
of
his
daughter
of
as
little
consequence
as
Blifil
himself
conceive
them
to
be
;
but
as
the
sentiment
of
Mr
Allworthy
be
of
a
very
different
kind
,
so
it
be
absolutely
necessary
to
impose
on
him
.
<EOS>
in
this
,
however
,
Blifil
be
so
well
assist
by
Western
,
that
he
succeed
without
difficulty
;
for
as
Mr
Allworthy
have
be
assure
by
her
father
that
Sophia
have
a
proper
affection
for
Blifil
,
and
that
all
which
he
have
suspect
concern
Jones
be
entirely
false
,
Blifil
have
nothing
more
to
do
than
to
confirm
these
assertion
;
which
he
do
with
such
equivocation
,
that
he
preserve
a
salvo
for
his
conscience
;
and
have
the
satisfaction
of
convey
a
lie
to
his
uncle
,
without
the
guilt
of
tell
one
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
examine
touch
the
inclination
of
Sophia
by
Allworthy
,
who
say
,
"
He
would
on
no
account
be
accessary
to
force
a
young
lady
into
a
marriage
contrary
to
her
own
will
;
"
he
answer
,
"
that
the
real
sentiment
of
young
lady
be
very
difficult
to
be
understand
;
that
her
behaviour
to
him
be
full
as
forward
as
he
wish
it
,
and
that
if
he
could
believe
her
father
,
she
have
all
the
affection
for
him
which
any
lover
could
desire
.
<EOS>
as
for
Jones
,
"
say
he
,
"
whom
I
be
loth
to
call
villain
,
though
his
behaviour
to
you
,
sir
,
sufficiently
justify
the
appellation
,
his
own
vanity
,
or
perhaps
some
wicked
view
,
may
make
him
boast
of
a
falsehood
;
for
if
there
have
be
any
reality
in
Miss
Western
's
love
to
him
,
the
greatness
of
her
fortune
would
never
have
suffer
him
to
desert
her
,
as
you
be
well
informed
he
hath
.
<EOS>
lastly
,
sir
,
I
promise
you
I
would
not
myself
,
for
any
consideration
,
no
,
not
for
the
whole
world
,
consent
to
marry
this
young
lady
,
if
I
be
not
persuade
she
have
all
the
passion
for
me
which
I
desire
she
should
have
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
excellent
method
of
convey
a
falsehood
with
the
heart
only
,
without
make
the
tongue
guilty
of
an
untruth
,
by
the
mean
of
equivocation
and
imposture
<EOS>
,
hath
quiet
the
conscience
of
many
a
notable
deceiver
;
and
yet
,
when
we
consider
that
it
be
omniscience
on
which
these
endeavour
to
impose
,
it
may
possibly
seem
capable
of
afford
only
a
very
superficial
comfort
;
and
that
this
artful
and
refined
distinction
between
communicate
a
lie
,
and
tell
one
,
be
hardly
worth
the
pain
it
cost
them
.
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
be
pretty
well
satisfied
with
what
Mr
Western
and
Mr
Blifil
tell
him
:
and
the
treaty
be
now
,
at
the
end
of
two
day
,
conclude
.
<EOS>
nothing
then
remain
previous
to
the
office
of
the
priest
,
but
the
office
of
the
lawyer
,
which
threaten
to
take
up
so
much
time
,
that
Western
offer
to
bind
himself
by
all
manner
of
covenant
,
rather
than
defer
the
happiness
of
the
young
couple
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
be
so
very
earnest
and
pressing
,
that
an
indifferent
person
may
have
conclude
he
be
more
a
principal
in
this
match
than
he
really
be
;
but
this
eagerness
be
natural
to
him
on
all
occasion
:
and
he
conduct
every
scheme
he
undertake
in
such
a
manner
,
as
if
the
success
of
that
alone
be
sufficient
to
constitute
the
whole
happiness
of
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
the
joint
importunity
of
both
father
and
son
-
in
-
law
would
probably
have
prevail
on
Mr
Allworthy
,
who
brook
but
ill
any
delay
of
give
happiness
to
other
,
have
not
Sophia
herself
prevent
it
,
and
take
measure
to
put
a
final
end
to
the
whole
treaty
,
and
to
rob
both
church
and
law
of
those
taxis
which
these
wise
body
have
think
proper
to
receive
from
the
propagation
of
the
human
specie
in
a
lawful
manner
.
<EOS>
of
which
in
the
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
a
strange
resolution
of
Sophia
,
and
a
more
strange
stratagem
of
Mrs
Honour
.
 
<EOS>
though
Mrs
Honour
be
principally
attach
to
her
own
interest
,
she
be
not
without
some
little
attachment
to
Sophia
.
<EOS>
to
say
truth
,
it
be
very
difficult
for
any
one
to
know
that
young
lady
without
love
her
.
<EOS>
She
no
sooner
therefore
hear
a
piece
of
news
,
which
she
imagine
to
be
of
great
importance
to
her
mistress
,
than
,
quite
forget
the
anger
which
she
have
conceive
two
day
before
,
at
her
unpleasant
dismission
from
Sophia
's
presence
,
she
run
hastily
to
inform
her
of
the
news
.
  
<EOS>
the
beginning
of
her
discourse
be
as
abrupt
as
her
entrance
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
o
dear
madam
!
<EOS>
"
say
she
,
"
what
doth
your
la'ship
think
?
<EOS>
to
be
sure
I
be
frighten
out
of
my
wit
;
and
yet
I
think
it
my
duty
to
tell
your
la'ship
,
though
perhaps
it
may
make
you
angry
,
<EOS>
for
we
servant
do
not
always
know
what
will
make
our
lady
angry
;
for
,
to
be
sure
,
everything
be
always
lay
to
the
charge
of
a
servant
.
<EOS>
when
our
lady
be
out
of
humour
,
to
be
sure
we
must
be
scold
;
and
to
be
sure
I
should
not
wonder
if
your
la'ship
should
be
out
of
humour
;
nay
,
it
must
surprize
you
certainly
,
ay
,
and
shock
you
too
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Good
Honour
,
let
me
know
it
without
any
long
preface
,
"
say
Sophia
;
"
there
be
few
thing

I
promise
you
,
which
will
surprize
,
and
few
which
will
shock
me

"
 
<EOS>
"
dear
madam
,
"
answer
honour
,
"
to
be
sure
<EOS>
,
I
overhear
my
master
talk
to
parson
Supple
about
get
a
licence
this
very
afternoon
;
and
to
be
sure
I
hear
him
say
,
your
la'ship
should
be
marry
to

morrow
morning

<EOS>
"
Sophia
turn
pale
at

repeat
eagerly
,
"
to

<EOS>
"
yes

reply
the
trusty

Honour

say
Sophia
,
"
you
have
both
surprize
and
shock
me
to
such
a
degree
that
I
have
scarce
any
breath

<EOS>
what
be
to

do
in
my
dreadful
situation

<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
be

"
<EOS>
do
advise
me

"
cry
Sophia
;
"
pray
,
dear
Honour
,
advise
me

<EOS>
think
what
you
would
attempt
if
it
be
your
own

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
madam
,
"
cry
Honour
,
"
<EOS>
I
wish
your
la'ship
and
I
could
change
situation
;
that
is
,
I
mean
without
hurt
your
la'ship
;
for
to
be
sure
I
do
not
wish
you
so
bad
as
to
be
a
servant
;
but
because
that
if
so
be
it
be
my
case
,
I
should
find
no
manner
of
difficulty
in
it
;
for
,
in
my
poor
opinion

young
Squire
Blifil
be
a
charming

sweet

handsome

you
frighten

your

such
wicked
thought

<EOS>
to
be
sure
I
tremble
every
inch
of
me

<EOS>
dear
madam
,
consider
,
that
to
be
deny
christian
burial
,
and
to
have
your
corpse
bury
in
the
highway
,
and
a
stake
drive
through
you
,
as
farmer
Halfpenny
be
serve
at
Ox
Cross
;
and
,
to
be
sure
,
his
ghost
hath
walk
there
ever
since

for
several
people
have
see
him
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
it
can
be
nothing
but
the
devil
which
can
put
such
wicked
thought
into
the
head
of
anybody
;
for
certainly
it
be
less
wicked
to
hurt
all
the
world
than
one
's
own
dear
self
;
and
so
I
have
hear
say
by
more
parson
than
one

<EOS>
if
your
la'ship
hath
such
a
violent
aversion
,
and
hate
the
young
gentleman
so
very
bad
,
that
you
can
not
bear
to
think
of
go
into
bed
to
him

for
to
be
sure
there
may
be
such
antipathy
in

one
have
liever
touch
a
toad

the

Sophia
have
be

excellent

I

there

Sophia

a
lady
of
quality
in
London

a
relation

who
spend
several
month
with
my

during

which
time
she
treat
me
with
great
kindness

so
much
pleasure

that
she
earnestly

I

no

<EOS>
"
I
would
not

for
the
first
lady
I
live
with
use

invite
people
very
earnestly

if
she

afterwards
they

she
use

out

<EOS>
"
You
be
mistaken
,
Honour

"
say
Sophia
:
"
<EOS>
she
look
upon
the
authority
of
a
father
in
a
much
low
light
than
I
do
;
for
she
press
me
violently
to
go
to
London
with
her
,
and
when
I
refuse
to
go
without
my
father
's
consent
,
she
laugh
me
to
scorn
,
call
me
silly
country
girl
,

say
,
I
should
make
a
pure
loving
wife
,
since
I
could
be
so
dutiful
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
so
I
have
no
doubt
<EOS>

she
will
both
receive
me

yes

I

I

they

ravish

consider

a
good
brisk
pace

will
preserve
us
from

cold
;
and
if
you
can
not

from
a
villain

Honour

I
will
defend

for
I
will
take
a

there

<EOS>
"
dear

you
frighten
me
more

more
,
"
cry
honour
:
"
<EOS>
sure
your

would
not
venture
to
fire
it
off
!
<EOS>
I
have
rather
run
any
chance
than
your

do
that
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
so
?
<EOS>
"

Sophia

smile
;
"
would
not
you

fire
a

<EOS>

cry

one

virtue
be
a
dear
thing

especially
to
us
poor
servant

for
it
be
our
livelihood
,
as
a
body
may
say
:
yet
I
mortally
hate
fire

arm

so
many
accident
happen
by

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
"

Sophia
,
"
I
believe
I
may
ensure
your
virtue
at
a
very
cheap
rate
,
without
carry
any
arm
with
us
;
for
I
intend
to
take
horse
at
the
very
first
town
we
come
to
,
and
we
shall
hardly
be
attack
in
our
way
thither
.
<EOS>
Look'ee
,
Honour
,
I
be
resolve
to
go
;
and
if
you
will
attend
me
,
I
promise
you
I
will
reward
you
to
the
very
utmost
of
my
power
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
last
argument
have
a
strong
effect
on
Honour
than
all
the
precede
.
<EOS>
and
since
she
see
her
mistress
so
determined
,
she
desist
from
any
further
dissuasion
.
<EOS>
They
then
enter
into
a
debate
on
way
and
mean
of
execute
their
project
.
<EOS>
here
a
very
stubborn
difficulty
occur
,
and
this
be
the
removal
of
their
effect
,
which
be
much
more
easily
get
over
by
the
mistress
than
by
the
maid
;
for
when
a
lady
hath
once
take
a
resolution
to
run
to
a
lover
,
or
to
run
from
him
,
all
obstacle
be
consider
as
trifle
.
<EOS>
but
Honour
be
inspire
by
no
such
motive
;
she
have
no
rapture
to
expect
,
nor
any
terror
to
shun
;
and
besides
the
real
value
of
her
clothe
,
in
which
consist
a
great
part
of
her
fortune
,
she
have
a
capricious
fondness
for
several
gown
,
and
other
thing
;
either
because
they
become
her
,
or
because
they
be
give
her
by
such
a
particular
person
;
because
she
have
buy
them
lately
,
or
because
she
have
have
them
long
;
or
for
some
other
reason
equally
good
;
so
that
she
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
leave
the
poor
thing
behind
her
expose
to
the
mercy
of
Western
,
who
,
she
doubt
not
,
would
in
his
rage
make
them
suffer
martyrdom
.
  
<EOS>
the
ingenious
Mrs
Honour
have
apply
all
her
oratory
to
dissuade
her
mistress
from
her
purpose
,
when
she
find
her
positively
determine
,
at
last
start
the
following
expedient
to
remove
her
clothe
,
viz
.
,
to
get
herself
turn
out
of
door
that
very
evening
.
<EOS>
Sophia
highly
approve
this
method
,
but
doubt
how
it
may
be
bring
about
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
o
,
madam
,
"
cry
Honour
,
"
your
la'ship
may
trust
that
to
me
;
we
servant
very
well
know
how
to
obtain
this
favour
of
our
master
and
mistress
;
though
sometimes
,
indeed
,
where
they
owe
us
more
wage
than
they
can
readily
pay
,
they
will
put
up
with
all
our
affront
,
and
will
hardly
take
any
warning
we
can
give
them
;
but
the
squire
be
none
of
those
;
and
since
your
la'ship
be
resolve
upon
set
out
to
-
night
,
I
warrant
I
get
discharge
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
then
resolve
that
she
should
pack
up
some
linen
and
a
night
-
gown
for
Sophia
,
with
her
own
thing
;
and
as
for
all
her
other
clothe
,
the
young
lady
abandon
them
with
no
more
remorse
than
the
sailor
feel
when
he
throw
over
the
good
of
other
,
in
order
to
save
his
own
life
.
    
<EOS>
contain
scene
of
altercation
,
of
no
very
uncommon
kind
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Honour
have
scarce
sooner
part
from
her
young
lady
,
than
something
(
for
I
<EOS>
would
not
,
like
the
old
woman
in
Quevedo
,
injure
the
devil
by
any
false
accusation
,
and
possibly
he
may
have
no
hand
in
it
)
 
but
<EOS>
something
,
I
say
,
suggest
itself
to
her
,
that
by
sacrifice
Sophia
and
all
her
secret
to
Mr
Western
,
she
may
probably
make
her
fortune
.
<EOS>
many
consideration
urge
this
discovery
.
<EOS>
the
fair
prospect
of
a
handsome
reward
for
so
great
and
acceptable
a
service
to
the
squire
,
tempt
her
avarice
;
and
again
,
the
danger
of
the
enterprize
she
have
undertake
;
the
uncertainty
of
its
success
;
night
,
cold
,
robber
,
ravisher
,
all
alarm
her
fear
.
<EOS>
so
forcibly
do
all
these
operate
upon
her
,
that
she
be
almost
determined
to
go
directly
to
the
squire
,
and
to
lay
open
the
whole
affair
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
however
,
too
upright
a
judge
to
decree
on
one
side
,
before
she
have
hear
the
other
.
<EOS>
and
here
,
first
,
a
journey
to
London
appear
very
strongly
in
support
of
Sophia
.
<EOS>
She
eagerly
long
to
see
a
place
in
which
she
fancy
charm
short
only
of
those
which
a
raptured
saint
imago
in
heaven
.
<EOS>
in
the
next
place
,
as
she
know
Sophia
to
have
much
more
generosity
than
her
master
,
so
her
fidelity
promise
her
a
great
reward
than
she
could
gain
by
treachery
.
<EOS>
She
then
cross
-
examine
all
the
article
which
have
raise
her
fear
on
the
other
side
,
and
find
,
on
fairly
sift
the
matter
,
that
there
be
very
little
in
them
.
<EOS>
and
now
both
scale
be
reduce
to
a
pretty
even
balance
,
her
love
to
her
mistress
be
throw
into
the
scale
of
her
integrity
,
make
that
rather
preponderate
,
when
a
circumstance
strike
upon
her
imagination
which
may
have
have
a
dangerous
effect
,
have
its
whole
weight
be
fairly
put
into
the
other
scale
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
length
of
time
which
must
intervene
before
Sophia
would
be
able
to
fulfil
her
promise
;
for
though
she
be
intitle
to
her
mother
's
fortune
at
the
death
of
her
father
,
and
to
the
sum
of
L3000
leave
her
by
an
uncle
when
she
come
of
age
;
yet
these
be
distant
day
,
and
many
accident
may
prevent
the
intend
generosity
of
the
young
lady
;
whereas
the
reward
she
may
expect
from
Mr
Western
be
immediate
.
<EOS>
but
while
she
be
pursue
this
think
the
good
genius
of
Sophia
,
or
that
which
preside
over
the
integrity
of
Mrs
Honour
,
or
perhaps
mere
chance
,
send
an
accident
in
her
way
,
which
at
once
preserve
her
fidelity
,
and
even
facilitate
the
intended
business
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Western
's
maid
claim
great
superiority
over
Mrs
Honour
on
several
account
.
<EOS>
first
,
her
birth
be
high
;
for
her
great
-
grandmother
by
the
mother
's
side
be
a
cousin
,
not
far
remove
,
to
an
irish
peer
.
<EOS>
secondly
,
her
wage
be
great
.
<EOS>
and
lastly
,
she
have
be
at
London
,
and
have
of
consequence
see
more
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
have
always
behave
,
therefore
,
to
Mrs
Honour
with
that
reserve
,
and
have
always
exact
of
her
those
mark
of
distinction
,
which
every
order
of
females
preserve
and
require
in
conversation
with
those
of
an
inferior
order
.
<EOS>
now
as
Honour
do
not
at
all
time
agree
with
this
doctrine
,
but
would
frequently
break
in
upon
the
respect
which
the
other
demand
,
Mrs
Western
's
maid
be
not
at
all
pleased
with
her
company
;
indeed
,
she
earnestly
long
to
return
home
to
the
house
of
her
mistress
,
where
she
domineer
at
will
over
all
the
other
servant
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
greatly
,
therefore
,
disappoint
in
the
morning
,
when
Mrs
Western
have
change
her
mind
on
the
very
point
of
departure
;
and
have
be
in
what
be
vulgarly
call
a
gloute
humour
ever
since
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
humour
,
which
be
none
of
the
sweetest
,
she
come
into
the
room
where
Honour
be
debate
with
herself
in
the
manner
we
have
above
relate
.
<EOS>
honour
no
sooner
see
her
,
than
she
address
her
in
the
following
obliging
phrase
:
"
Soh
,
madam
,
I
find
we
be
to
have
the
pleasure
of
your
company
longer
,
which
I
be
afraid
the
quarrel
between
my
master
and
your
lady
would
have
rob
us
of
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
madam
,
"
answer
the
other
,
"
what
you
mean
by
we
and
us
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
I
do
not
look
on
any
of
the
servant
in
this

upon

she
strut
by
Mrs
Western

the
most
provoking

of
contempt

I

the

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Western
speak
,
or
rather
thunder
,
in
answer
;
but
as
she
be
hardly
articulate
,
we
can
not
be
very
certain
of
the
identical
word
;
we
shall
therefore
omit
insert
a
speech
which
at
good
would
not
greatly
redound
to
her
honour
.
<EOS>
She
then
depart
in
search
of
her
brother
,
with
a
countenance
so
full
of
rage
,
that
she
resemble
one
of
the
fury
rather
than
a
human
creature
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
chambermaid
be
again
leave
alone
,
begin
a
second
bout
at
altercation
,
which
soon
produce
a
combat
of
a
more
active
kind
.
<EOS>
in
this
the
victory
belong
to
the
lady
of
inferior
rank
,
but
not
without
some
loss
of
blood
,
of
hair
,
and
of
lawn
and
muslin
.
    
<EOS>
the
wise
demeanour
of
Mr
Western
in
the
character
of
a
magistrate
.
<EOS>
a
hint
to
justice
of
peace
,
concern
the
necessary
qualification
of
a
clerk
;
with
extraordinary
instance
of
paternal
madness
and
filial
affection
.
 
<EOS>
Logicians
sometimes
prove
too
much
by
an
argument
,
and
politician
often
overreach
themselves
in
a
scheme
.
<EOS>
thus
have
it
like
to
have
happen
to
Mrs
Honour
,
who
,
instead
of
recover
the
rest
of
her
clothe
,
have
like
to
have
stop
even
those
she
have
on
her
back
from
escape
;
for
the
squire
no
sooner
hear
of
her
have
abuse
his
sister
,
than
he
swear
twenty
oath
he
would
send
her
to
Bridewell
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Western
be
a
very
good
-
natured
woman
,
and
ordinarily
of
a
forgiving
temper
.
<EOS>
She
have
lately
remit
the
trespass
of
a
stage
-
coachman
,
who
have
overturn
her
post
-
chaise
into
a
ditch
;
nay
,
she
have
even
break
the
law
,
in
refuse
to
prosecute
a
highwayman
who
have
rob
her
,
not
only
of
a
sum
of
money
,
but
of
her
ear
-
ring
;
at
the
same
time
d
 
ne
her
,
and
say
,
"
such
handsome
b####s
as
you
do
not
want
jewel
to
set
them
off
,
and
be
d####n'd
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
but
now
,
so
uncertain
be
our
temper
,
and
so
much
do
we
at
different
time
differ
from
ourselves
,
she
would
hear
of
no
mitigation
;
nor
could
all
the
affected
penitence
of
Honour
,
nor
all
the
entreaty
of
Sophia
for
her
own
servant
,
prevail
with
her
to
desist
from
earnestly
desire
her
brother
to
execute
justiceship
(
for
it
be
indeed
a
syllable
more
than
justice
)
on
the
wench
.
  
<EOS>
but
luckily
the
clerk
have
a
qualification
,
which
no
clerk
to
a
justice
of
peace
ought
ever
to
be
without
,
namely
,
some
understanding
in
the
law
of
this
realm
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
whisper
in
the
ear
of
the
justice
that
he
would
exceed
his
authority
by
commit
the
girl
to
Bridewell
,
as
there
have
be
no
attempt
to
break
the
peace
;
"
for
I
be
afraid
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
can
not
legally
commit
any
one
to
Bridewell
only
for
ill
-
breeding
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
matter
of
high
importance
,
particularly
in
case
relate
to
the
game
,
the
justice
be
not
always
attentive
to
these
admonition
of
his
clerk
;
for
,
indeed
,
in
execute
the
law
under
that
head
,
many
justice
of
peace
suppose
they
have
a
large
discretionary
power
,
by
virtue
of
which
,
under
the
notion
of
search
for
and
take
away
engine
for
the
destruction
of
the
game
,
they
often
commit
trespass
,
and
sometimes
felony
,
at
their
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
offence
be
not
of
quite
so
high
a
nature
,
nor
so
dangerous
to
the
society
.
<EOS>
here
,
therefore
,
the
justice
behave
with
some
attention
to
the
advice
of
his
clerk
;
for
,
in
fact
,
he
have
already
have
two
information
exhibit
against
him
in
the
King
's
Bench
,
and
have
no
curiosity
to
try
a
third
.
  
<EOS>
the
squire
,
therefore
,
put
on
a
most
wise
and
significant
countenance
,
after
a
preface
of
several
hum
and
hah
,
tell
his
sister
,
that
upon
more
mature
deliberation
,
he
be
of
opinion
,
that
"
as
there
be
no
breaking
up
of
the
peace
,
such
as
the
law
,
"
say
he
,
"
call
break
open
a
door
,
or
break
a
hedge
,
or
break
a
head
,
or
any
such
sort
of
breaking
,
the
matter
do
not
amount
to
a
felonious
kind
of
a
thing
,
nor
trespass
,
nor
damage
,
and
,
therefore
,
there
be
no
punishment
in
the
law
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Western
say
,
"
she
know
the
law
much
better
;
that
she
have
know
servant
very
severely
punish
for
affront
their
master
;
"
and
then
name
a
certain
justice
of
the
peace
in
London
,
"
who
,
"
she
say
,
"
would
commit
a
servant
to
Bridewell
at
any
time
when
a
master
or
mistress
desire
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
like
enough
,
"
cry
the
squire
;
"
it
may
be
so
in
London
;
but
the
law
be
different
in
the
country
.
"
<EOS>
here
follow
a
very
learned
dispute
between
the
brother
and
sister
concern
the
law
,
which
we
would
insert
,
if
we
imagine
many
of
our
reader
could
understand
it
.
<EOS>
this
be
,
however
,
at
length
refer
by
both
party
to
the
clerk
,
who
decide
it
in
favour
of
the
magistrate
;
and
Mrs
Western
be
,
in
the
end
,
oblige
to
content
herself
with
the
satisfaction
of
have
Honour
turn
away
;
to
which
Sophia
herself
very
readily
and
cheerfully
consent
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
Fortune
,
after
have
divert
herself
,
accord
to
custom
,
with
two
or
three
frolick
,
at
last
dispose
all
matter
to
the
advantage
of
our
heroine
;
who
indeed
succeed
admirably
well
in
her
deceit
,
consider
it
be
the
first
she
have
ever
practise
.
<EOS>
and
,
to
say
the
truth
,
I
have
often
conclude
,
that
the
honest
part
of
mankind
would
be
much
too
hard
for
the
knavish
,
if
they
could
bring
themselves
to
incur
the
guilt
,
or
think
it
worth
their
while
to
take
the
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
Honour
act
her
part
to
the
utmost
perfection
.
<EOS>
She
no
sooner
see
herself
secure
from
all
danger
of
Bridewell
,
a
word
which
have
raise
most
horrible
idea
in
her
mind
,
than
she
resume
those
air
which
her
terror
before
have
a
little
abated
;
and
lay
down
her
place
,
with
as
much
affectation
of
content
,
and
indeed
of
contempt
,
as
be
ever
practise
at
the
resignation
of
place
of
much
great
importance
.
<EOS>
if
the
reader
please
,
therefore
,
we
chuse
rather
to
say
she
resign
 
<EOS>
which
hath
,
indeed
,
be
always
hold
a
synonymous
expression
with
be
turn
out
,
or
turn
away
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Western
order
her
to
be
very
expeditious
in
packing
;
for
his
sister
declare
she
would
not
sleep
another
night
under
the
same
roof
with
so
impudent
a
slut
.
<EOS>
to
work
therefore
she
go
,
and
that
so
earnestly
,
that
everything
be
ready
early
in
the
evening
;
when
,
have
receive
her
wage
,
away
pack
bag
and
baggage
,
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
every
one
,
but
of
none
more
than
of
Sophia
;
who
,
have
appoint
her
maid
to
meet
her
at
a
certain
place
not
far
from
the
house
,
exactly
at
the
dreadful
and
ghostly
hour
of
twelve
,
begin
to
prepare
for
her
own
departure
.
  
<EOS>
but
first
she
be
oblige
to
give
two
painful
audience
,
the
one
to
her
aunt
,
and
the
other
to
her
father
.
<EOS>
in
these
Mrs
Western
herself
begin
to
talk
to
her
in
a
more
peremptory
stile
than
before
:
but
her
father
treat
her
in
so
violent
and
outrageous
a
manner
,
that
he
frighten
her
into
an
affected
compliance
with
his
will
;
which
so
highly
please
the
good
squire
,
that
he
change
his
frown
into
smile
,
and
his
menace
into
promise
<EOS>
:
he
vow
his
whole
soul
be
wrapt
in
her
;
that
her
consent
(
for
so
he
construe
the
word
,
"
You
know
,
sir
,
I
must
not
,
nor
can
,
refuse
to
obey
any
absolute
command
of
yours
"
)
have
make
him
the
happy
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
He
then
give
her
a
large
bank
-
bill
to
dispose
of
in
any
trinket
she
please
,
and
kiss
and
embrace
her
in
the
fond
manner
,
while
tear
of
joy
trickle
from
those
eye
which
a
few
moment
before
have
dart
fire
and
rage
against
the
dear
object
of
all
his
affection
.
  
<EOS>
instance
of
this
behaviour
in
parent
be
so
common
,
that
the
reader
,
I
doubt
not
,
will
be
very
little
astonished
at
the
whole
conduct
of
Mr
Western
.
<EOS>
if
he
should
,
I
own
I
be
not
able
to
account
for
it
;
since
that
he
love
his
daughter
most
tenderly
,
be
,
I
think
,
beyond
dispute
.
<EOS>
so
indeed
have
many
other
,
who
have
render
their
child
most
completely
miserable
by
the
same
conduct
;
which
,
though
it
be
almost
universal
in
parent
,
hath
always
appear
to
me
to
be
the
most
unaccountable
of
all
the
absurdity
which
ever
enter
into
the
brain
of
that
strange
prodigious
creature
man
.
  
<EOS>
the
latter
part
of
Mr
Western
's
behaviour
have
so
strong
an
effect
on
the
tender
heart
of
Sophia
,
that
it
suggest
a
thought
to
her
,
which
not
all
the
sophistry
of
her
politic
aunt
,
nor
all
the
menace
of
her
father
,
have
ever
once
bring
into
her
head
.
<EOS>
She
reverence
her
father
so
piously
,
and
love
him
so
passionately
,
that
she
have
scarce
ever
feel
more
pleasing
sensation
,
than
what
arise
from
the
share
she
frequently
have
of
contribute
to
his
amusement
,
and
sometimes
,
perhaps
,
to
high
gratification
;
for
he
never
could
contain
the
delight
of
hear
her
commend
,
which
he
have
the
satisfaction
of
hear
almost
every
day
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
the
idea
,
therefore
,
of
the
immense
happiness
she
should
convey
to
her
father
by
her
consent
to
this
match
,
make
a
strong
impression
on
her
mind
.
<EOS>
again
,
the
extreme
piety
of
such
an
act
of
obedience
work
very
forcibly
,
as
she
have
a
very

lastly

when
she
reflect
how
much
she
herself
be
to
suffer
,
be
indeed
to
become
little
less
than
a
sacrifice
,
or
a
martyr
,
to
filial
love
and
duty
,
she
feel
an
agreeable
tickling
in
a
certain
little
passion
,
which
though
it
bear
no
immediate
affinity
either
to
religion

virtue

be
often
so
kind

to
lend
great
assistance

<EOS>
Sophia
be
charm
with
the
contemplation
of
so
heroic
an
action
,
and
begin
to
compliment
herself
with
much
premature
flattery

Cupid

like
Punchinello

<EOS>
in
truth
(
for
we

or
to
vindicate
the
character
of
our
heroine

ascribe
her
action
to
supernatural
impulse
)
<EOS>
the
thought
of
her
beloved
Jones
,
and
some
hope
(
however
distant
)
in
which
he
be
very
particularly
concern

immediately
destroy
all
which
filial
love
,
piety
,
and
pride
<EOS>
have
,
with
their
joint

be

to

<EOS>
but
before
we
proceed
any
farther
with
Sophia
,
we
must
now
look
back
to
Mr
Jones
.
    
<EOS>
contain
several
matter
,
natural
enough
perhaps
,
but
low
.
 
<EOS>
the
reader
will
be
pleased
to
remember
,
that
we
leave
Mr
Jones
,
in
the
beginning
of
this
book
,
on
his
road
to
Bristol
;
be
determine
to
seek
his
fortune
at
sea
,
or
rather
,
indeed
,
to
fly
away
from
his
fortune
on
shore
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
(
a
thing
not
very
unusual
)
,
that
the
guide
who
undertake
to
conduct
him
on
his
way
,
be
unluckily
unacquainted
with
the
road
;
so
that
have
miss
his
right
track
,
and
be
ashamed
to
ask
information
,
he
ramble
about
backwards
and
forwards
till
night
come
on
,
and
it
begin
to
grow
dark
.
<EOS>
Jones
suspect
what
have
happen
,
acquaint
the
guide
with
his
apprehension
;
but
he
insist
on
it
,
that
they
be
in
the
right
road
,
and
add
,
it
would
be
very
strange
if
he
should
not
know
the
road
to
Bristol
;
though
,
in
reality
,
it
would
have
be
much
strange
if
he
have
know
it
,
have
never
past
through
it
in
his
life
before
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
have
not
such
implicit
faith
in
his
guide
,
but
that
on
their
arrival
at
a
village
he
inquire
of
the
first
fellow
he
see
,
whether
they
be
in
the
road
to
Bristol
.
<EOS>
"
Whence
do
you
come
?
"
cry
the
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
matter
,
"
say
Jones
,
a
little
hastily
;
"
I
want
to
know
if
this
be
the
road
to
Bristol
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
road
to
Bristol
!
"
<EOS>
cry
the
fellow
,
scratch
his
head
:
"
<EOS>
why
,
measter
,
I
believe
you
will
hardly
get
to
Bristol
this
way
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Prithee
,
friend
,
then
,
"
answer
Jones
,
"
do
tell
us
which
be
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
measter
,
"
cry
the
fellow
,
"
you
must
be
come
out
of
your
road

the
Lord

whither

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,

which

go
to
Bristol
?
"

Jones

<EOS>
"
why
,
you
be
go
away
from
Bristol

the
fellow

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
,
"

Jones
,
"
we
must
go
back
again
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
you
must
,
"
say
the
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
and
when
we
come
back
to
the
top
of
the
hill
,
which
way

"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
must
keep

<EOS>

I
remember
there
be
two
road

one
to
the
right

the
other
to
the

"
 
<EOS>
"
why

you
must
keep

strait

only
remember
to
turn
vurst
to
your

then
to

then
to
your

that
bring
you

and
then
you
must
keep
strait
vorward
,
and
turn
to
the

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
another
fellow
now
come
up
,
and
ask
which
way
the
gentleman
be
go
;
of
which
be
inform
by
Jones
,
he
first
scratch
his
head
,
and
then
lean
upon
a
pole
he
have
in
his
hand
,
begin
to
tell
him
,
"
that
he
must
keep
the
right
-
hand
road
for
about
a
mile
,
or
a
mile
and
a
half
,
or
such
a
matter
,
and
then
he
must
turn
short
to
the
left
,
which
would
bring
him
round
by
Measter
Jin
Bearnes
's
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
which
be
Mr
John
Bearnes
's
?
"
say
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
o
Lord
!
"
cry
the
fellow
,
"
why
,
do
not
you
know
<EOS>
Measter
Jin
Bearnes
?
<EOS>
whence
then
do
you
come
?
"
  
<EOS>
these
two
fellow
have
almost
conquer
the
patience
of
Jones
,
when
a
plain
well
-
look
man
(
who
be
indeed
a
Quaker
)
accost
him
thus
:
"
friend
,
I
perceive
thou
hast
lose
thy
way
;
and
if
thou
wilt
take
my
advice
,
thou
wilt
not
attempt
to
find
it
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
It
be
almost
dark
,
and
the
road
be
difficult
to
hit
;
besides
,
there
have
be
several
robbery
commit
lately
between
this
and
Bristol
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
very
creditable
good
house
just
by
,
where
thou
may'st
find
good
entertainment
for
thyself
and
thy
cattle
till
morning
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Jones
,
after
a
little
persuasion
,
agree
to
stay
in
this
place
till
the
morning
,
and
be
conduct
by
his
friend
to
the
public
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
landlord
,
who
be
a
very
civil
fellow
,
tell
Jones
,
"
He
hope
he
would
excuse
the
badness
of
his
accommodation
;
for
that
his
wife
be
go
from
home
,
and
have
lock
up
almost
everything
,
and
carry
the
key
along
with
her
.
"
<EOS>
indeed
the
fact
be
,
that
a
favourite
daughter
of
her
be
just
married
,
and
go
that
morning
home
with
her
husband
;
and
that
she
and
her
mother
together
have
almost
stript
the
poor
man
of
all
his
good
,
as
well
as
money
;
for
though
he
have
several
child
,
this
daughter
only
,
who
be
the
mother
's
favourite
,
be
the
object
of
her
consideration
;
and
to
the
humour
of
this
one
child
she
would
with
pleasure
have
sacrifice
all
the
rest
,
and
her
husband
into
the
bargain
.
  
<EOS>
though
Jones
be
very
unfit
for
any
kind
of
company
,
and
would
have
prefer
be
alone
,
yet
he
could
not
resist
the
importunity
of
the
honest
Quaker
;
who
be
the
more
desirous
of
sit
with
him
,
from
have
remark
the
melancholy
which
appear
both
in
his
countenance
and
behaviour
;
and
which
the
poor
Quaker
think
his
conversation
may
in
some
measure
relieve
.
  
<EOS>
after
they
have
past
some
time
together
,
in
such
a
manner
that
my
honest
friend
may
have
think
himself
at
one
of
his
silent
meeting
,
the
Quaker
begin
to
be
move
by
some
spirit
or
other
,
probably
that
of
curiosity
,
and
say
,
"
friend
,
I
perceive
some
sad
disaster
hath
befallen
thee
;
but
pray
be
of
comfort
.
<EOS>
perhaps
thou
hast
lose
a
friend
.
<EOS>
if
so
,
thou
must
consider
we
be
all
mortal
.
<EOS>
and
why
shouldst
thou
grieve
,
when
thou
knowest
thy
grief
will
do
thy
friend
<EOS>
no
good
?
<EOS>
We
be
all
bear
to
affliction
.
<EOS>
I
myself
have
my
sorrow
as
well
as
thee
,
and
most
probably
great
sorrow
.
<EOS>
though
I
have
a
clear
estate
of
L100
a
year
,
which
be
as
much
as
I
want
,
and
I
have
a
conscience
,
I
thank
the
Lord
,
void
of
offence
;
my
constitution
be
sound
and
strong
,
and
there
be
no
man
can
demand
a
debt
of
me
,
nor
accuse
me
of
an
injury
;
yet
,
friend
,
I
should
be
concern
to
think
thee
as
miserable
as
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
the
Quaker
end
with
a
deep
sigh
;
and
Jones
presently
answer
,
"
I
be
very
sorry
,
sir
,
for
your
unhappiness
,
whatever
be
the
occasion
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
friend
,
"
reply
the
Quaker
,
"
one
only
daughter
be
the
occasion
;
one
who
be
my
great
delight
upon
earth
,
and
who
within
this
week
be
run
away
from
me
,
and
be
marry
against
my
consent
.
<EOS>
I
have
provide
her
a
proper
match
,
a
sober
man
and
one
of
substance
;
but
she
,
forsooth
,
would
chuse
for
herself
,
and
away
she
be
go
with
a
young
fellow
not
worth
a
groat
.
<EOS>
if
she
have
be
dead
,
as
I
suppose
thy
friend
be
,
I
should
have
be
happy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
very
strange
,
sir
,
"
say
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
would
it
not
be
well
for
her
to
be
dead
,
than
to
be
a
beggar
?
<EOS>
"
reply
the
Quaker
:
"
for
,
as
I
tell
you
,
the
fellow
be
not
worth
a
groat
;
and
surely
she
can
not
expect
that
I
shall
ever
give
her
a
shilling
.
<EOS>
no
,
as
she
hath
marry
for
love
,
let
her
live
on
love
if
she
can
;
let
her
carry
her
love
to
market
,
and
see
whether
any
one
will
change
it
into
silver
,
or
even
into
halfpence
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
your
own
concern
best
,
sir
,
"
say
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
have
be
,
"
continue
the
Quaker
,
"
a
long
premeditate
scheme
to
cheat
me
:
for
they
have
know
one
another
from
their
infancy
;
and
I
always
preach
to
her
against
love
,
and
tell
her
a
thousand
time
over
it
be
all
folly
and
wickedness
.
<EOS>
nay
,
the
cunning
slut
pretend
to
hearken
to
me
,
and
to
despise
all
wantonness
of
the
flesh
;
and
yet
at
last
break
out
at
a
window
two
pair
of
stair
:
for
I
begin
,
indeed
,
a
little
to
suspect
her
,
and
have
lock
her
up
carefully
,
intend
the
very
next
morning
to
have
marry
her
up
to
my
liking
.
<EOS>
but
she
disappoint
me
within
a
few
hour
,
and
escape
away
to
the
lover
of
her
own
chusing
;
who
lose
no
time
,
for
they
be
marry
and
bed
and
all
within
an
hour
.
<EOS>
but
it
shall
be
the
bad
hour
's
work
for
them
both
that
ever
they
do
;
for
they
may
starve
,
or
beg
,
or
steal
together
,
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
never
give
either
of
them
a
farthing
.
"
<EOS>
here
Jones
start
up
cry
,
"
I
really
must
be
excuse
:
I
wish
you
would
leave
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
come
,
come
,
friend
,
"
say
the
Quaker
,
"
do
not
give
way
to
concern
.
<EOS>
You
see
there
be
other
people
miserable
besides
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
there
be
madman
,
and
fool
,
and
villain
in
the
world
,
"
cry
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
but
let
me
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
:
send
for
your
daughter
and
son
-
in
-
law
home
,
and
do
not
be
yourself
the
only
cause
of
misery
to
one
you
pretend
to
love
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
send
for
her
and
her
husband
home
!
"
<EOS>
cry
the
Quaker
loudly
;
"
I
would
sooner
send
for
the
two
great
enemy
I
have
in
the
world
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
go
home
yourself
,
or
where
you
please
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
for
I
will
sit
no
longer
in
such
company
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
friend
<EOS>
,
"
answer
the
Quaker
,
"
I
scorn
to
impose
my
company
on
any
one
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
offer
to
pull
money
from
his
pocket
,
but
Jones
push
him
with
some
violence
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
the
subject
of
the
Quaker
's
discourse
have
so
deeply
affect
Jones
,
that
he
stare
very
wildly
all
the
time
he
be
speak
.
<EOS>
this
the
Quaker
have
observe
,
and
this
,
add
to
the
rest
of
his
behaviour
,
inspire
honest
Broadbrim
with
a
conceit
,
that
his
companion
be
in
reality
out
of
his
sense
.
<EOS>
instead
of
resent
the
affront
,
therefore
,
the
Quaker
be
move
with
compassion
for
his
unhappy
circumstance
;
and
have
communicate
his
opinion
to
the
landlord
,
he
desire
him
to
take
great
care
of
his
guest
,
and
to
treat
him
with
the
high
civility
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
"
say
the
landlord
,
"
I
shall
use
no
such
civility
towards
him
;
for
it
seem
,
for
all
his
laced
waistcoat
there
,
he
be
no
more
a
gentleman
than
myself
,
but
a
poor
parish
bastard
,
breed
up
at
a
great
squire
be
about
thirty
mile
off
,
and
now
turn
out
of
door
(
not
for
any
good
to
be
sure
)
.
<EOS>
I
shall
get
him
out
of
my
house
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
if
I
do
lose
my
reckoning
,
the
first
loss
be
always
the
good
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
above
a
year
ago
that
I
lose
a
silver
spoon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
dost
thou
talk
of
a
parish
bastard
,
Robin
?
"
answer
the
Quaker
.
<EOS>
"
Thou
must
certainly
be
mistake
in
thy
man
.
"
  
"
not
at
all
,
"
reply
Robin
;
"
the
guide
,
who
know
him
very
well
,
tell
it
me
.
"
<EOS>
for
,
indeed
,
the
guide
have
no
sooner
take
his
place
at
the
kitchen
fire
,
than
he
acquaint
the
whole
company
with
all
he
know
or
have
ever
hear
concern
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
the
Quaker
be
no
sooner
assure
by
this
fellow
of
the
birth
and
low
fortune
of
Jones
,
than
all
compassion
for
him
vanish
;
and
the
honest
plain
man
go
home
fire
with
no
less
indignation
than
a
duke
would
have
feel
at
receive
an
affront
from
such
a
person
.
  
<EOS>
the
landlord
himself
conceive
an
equal
disdain
for
his
guest
;
so
that
when
Jones
ring
the
bell
in
order
to
retire
to
bed
,
he
be
acquaint
that
he
could
have
no
bed
there
.
<EOS>
besides
disdain
of
the
mean
condition
of
his
guest
,
Robin
entertain
violent
suspicion
of
his
intention
,
which
be
,
he
suppose
,
to
watch
some
favourable
opportunity
of
rob
the
house
.
<EOS>
in
reality
,
he
may
have
be
very
well
ease
of
these
apprehension
,
by
the
prudent
precaution
of
his
wife
and
daughter
,
who
have
already
remove
everything
which
be
not
fix
to
the
freehold
;
but
he
be
by
nature
suspicious
,
and
have
be
more
particularly
so
since
the
loss
of
his
spoon
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
dread
of
be
rob
totally
absorb
the
comfortable
consideration
that
he
have
nothing
to
lose
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
be
assure
that
he
could
have
no
bed
,
very
contentedly
betook
himself
to
a
great
chair
make
with
rush
,
when
sleep
,
which
have
lately
shun
his
company
in
much
well
apartment
,
generously
pay
him
a
visit
in
his
humble
cell
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
the
landlord
,
he
be
prevent
by
his
fear
from
retire
to
rest
.
<EOS>
He
return
therefore
to
the
kitchen
fire
,
whence
he
could
survey
the
only
door
which
open
into
the
parlour
,
or
rather
hole
,
where
Jones
be
seat
;
and
as
for
the
window
to
that
room
,
it
be
impossible
for
any
creature
large
than
a
cat
to
have
make
his
escape
through
it
.
    
<EOS>
the
adventure
of
a
company
of
soldier
.
 
<EOS>
the
landlord
have
take
his
seat
directly
opposite
to
the
door
of
the
parlour
,
determine
to
keep
guard
there
the
whole
night
.
<EOS>
the
guide
and
another
fellow
remain
long
on
duty
with
him
,
though
they
neither
know
his
suspicion
,
nor
have
any
of
their
own
.
<EOS>
the
true
cause
of
their
watching
do
,
indeed
,
at
length
,
put
an
end
to
it
;
for
this
be
no
other
than
the
strength
and
goodness
of
the
beer
,
of
which
have
tipple
a
very
large
quantity
,
they
grow
at
first
very
noisy
and
vociferous
,
and
afterwards
fall
both
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
in
the
power
of
liquor
to
compose
the
fear
of
Robin
.
<EOS>
He
continue
still
wake
in
his
chair
,
with
his
eye
fix
stedfastly
on
the
door
which
lead
into
the
apartment
of
Mr
Jones
,
till
a
violent
thundering
at
his
outward
gate
call
him
from
his
seat
,
and
oblige
him
to
open
it
;
which
he
have
no
sooner
do
,
than
his
kitchen
be
immediately
full
of
gentleman
in
red
coat
,
who
all
rush
upon
him
in
as
tumultuous
a
manner
as
if
they
intend
to
take
his
little
castle
by
storm
.
  
<EOS>
the
landlord
be
now
force
from
his
post
to
furnish
his
numerous
guest
with
beer
,
which
they
call
for
with
great
eagerness
;
and
upon
his
second
or
third
return
from
the
cellar
,
he
see
Mr
Jones
stand
before
the
fire
in
the
midst
of
the
soldier
;
for
it
may
easily
be
believe
,
that
the
arrival
of
so
much
good
company
should
put
an
end
to
any
sleep
,
unless
that
from
which
we
be
to
be
awaken
only
by
the
last
trumpet
.
  
<EOS>
the
company
have
now
pretty
well
satisfy
their
thirst
,
nothing
remain
but
to
pay
the
reckoning
,
a
circumstance
often
productive
of
much
mischief
and
discontent
among
the
inferior
rank
of
gentry
,
who
be
apt
to
find
great
difficulty
in
assess
the
sum
,
with
exact
regard
to
distributive
justice
,
which
direct
that
every
man
shall
pay
accord
to
the
quantity
which
he
drink
.
<EOS>
this
difficulty
occur
upon
the
present
occasion
;
and
it
be
the
great
,
as
some
gentleman
have
,
in
their
extreme
hurry
,
march
off
,
after
their
first
draught
,
and
have
entirely
forget
to
contribute
anything
towards
the
say
reckoning
.
  
<EOS>
a
violent
dispute
now
arise
,
in
which
every
word
may
be
say
to
have
be
depose
upon
oath
;
for
the
oath
be
at
least
equal
to
all
the
other
word
speak
.
<EOS>
in
this
controversy
the
whole
company
speak
together
,
and
every
man
seem
wholly
bent
to
extenuate
the
sum
which
fall
to
his
share
;
so
that
the
most
probable
conclusion
which
could
be
foresee
be
,
that
a
large
portion
of
the
reckon
would
fall
to
the
landlord
's
share
to
pay
,
or
(
what
be
much
the
same
thing
)
would
remain
unpaid
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
while
Mr
Jones
be
engage
in
conversation
with
the
serjeant
;
for
that
officer
be
entirely
unconcerned
in
the
present
dispute
,
be
privilege
by
immemorial
custom
from
all
contribution
.
  
<EOS>
the
dispute
now
grow
so
very
warm
that
it
seem
to
draw
towards
a
military
decision
,
when
Jones
,
step
forward
,
silence
all
their
clamour
at
once
,
by
declare
that
he
would
pay
the
whole
reckoning
,
which
indeed
amount
to
no
more
than
three
shilling
and
fourpence
.
  
<EOS>
this
declaration
procure
Jones
the
thank
and
applause
of
the
whole
company
.
<EOS>
the
term
honourable
,
noble
,
and
worthy
gentleman
,
resound
through
the
room
;
nay
,
my
landlord
himself
begin
to
have
a
well
opinion
of
him
,
and
almost
to
disbelieve
the
account
which
the
guide
have
give
.
  
<EOS>
the
serjeant
have
inform
Mr
Jones
that
they
be
march
against
the
rebel
,
and
expect
to
be
command
by
the
glorious
Duke
of
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
by
which
the
reader
may
perceive
(
a
circumstance
which
we
have
not
think
necessary
to
communicate
before
)
that
this
be
the
very
time
when
the
late
rebellion
be
at
the
high
;
and
indeed
the
bandit
be
now
march
into
England
,
intending
,
as
it
be
think
,
to
fight
the
king
's
force
,
and
to
attempt
push
forward
to
the
metropolis
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
have
some
heroic
ingredient
in
his
composition
,
and
be
a
hearty
well
-
wisher
to
the
glorious
cause
of
liberty
,
and
of
the
protestant
religion
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
wonder
,
therefore
,
that
in
circumstance
which
would
have
warrant
a
much
more
romantic
and
wild
undertaking
,
it
should
occur
to
him
to
serve
as
a
volunteer
in
this
expedition
.
  
<EOS>
Our
command
officer
have
say
all
in
his
power
to
encourage
and
promote
this
good
disposition
,
from
the
first
moment
he
have
be
acquaint
with
it
.
<EOS>
He
now
proclaim
the
noble
resolution
aloud
,
which
be
receive
with
great
pleasure
by
the
whole
company
,
who
all
cry
out
,
"
God
bless
King
George
and
your
honour
;
"
and
then
add
,
with
many
oath
,
"
We
will
stand
by
you
both
to
the
last
drop
of
our
blood
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
gentleman
who
have
be
all
night
tipple
at
the
alehouse
,
be
prevail
on
by
some
argument
which
a
corporal
have
put
into
his
hand
,
to
undertake
the
same
expedition
.
<EOS>
and
now
the
portmanteau
belong
to
Mr
Jones
be
put
up
in
the
baggage
-
cart
,
the
force
be
about
to
move
forwards
;
when
the
guide
,
step
up
to
Jones
,
say
,
"
Sir
,
I
hope
you
will
consider
that
the
horse
have
be
keep
out
all
night
,
and
we
have
travel
a
great
way
out
of
our
way
.
<EOS>
"
Jones
be
surprize
at
the
impudence
of
this
demand
,
and
acquaint
the
soldier
with
the
merit
of
his
cause
,
who
be
all
unanimous
in
condemn
the
guide
for
his
endeavour
to
put
upon
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
some
say
,
he
ought
to
be
tie
neck
and
heel
;
other
that
he
deserve
to
run
the
gantlope
;
and
the
serjeant
shake
his
cane
at
him
,
and
wish
he
have
him
under
his
command
,
swear
heartily
he
would
make
an
example
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
content
himself
however
with
a
negative
punishment
,
and
walk
off
with
his
new
comrade
,
leave
the
guide
to
the
poor
revenge
of
curse
and
revile
him
;
in
which
latter
the
landlord
join
,
say
,
"
ay
,
ay
,
he
be
a
pure
one
,
I
warrant
you
.
<EOS>
a
pretty
gentleman
,
indeed
,
to
go
for
a
soldier
!
<EOS>
He
shall
wear
a
laced
wastecoat
truly
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
old
proverb
and
a
true
one
,
all
be
not
gold
that
glister
.
<EOS>
I
be
glad
my
house
be
well
rid
of
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
all
that
day
the
serjeant
and
the
young
soldier
march
together
;
and
the
former
,
who
be
an
arch
fellow
,
tell
the
latter
many
entertaining
story
of
his
campaign
,
though
in
reality
he
have
never
make
any
;
for
he
be
but
lately
come
into
the
service
,
and
have
,
by
his
own
dexterity
,
so
well
ingratiate
himself
with
his
officer
,
that
he
have
promote
himself
to
a
halberd
;
<EOS>
chiefly
indeed
by
his
merit
in
recruiting
,
in
which
he
be
most
excellently
well
skilled
.
  
<EOS>
much
mirth
and
festivity
pass
among
the
soldier
during
their
march
.
<EOS>
in
which
the
many
occurrence
that
have
pass
at
their
last
quarter
be
remember
,
and
every
one
,
with
great
freedom
,
make
what
joke
he
please
on
his
officer
,
some
of
which
be
of
the
coarser
kind
,
and
very
near
border
on
scandal
.
<EOS>
this
bring
to
our
heroe
's
mind
the
custom
which
he
have
read
of
among
the
Greeks
and
Romans
,
of
indulge
,
on
certain
festival
and
solemn
occasion
,
the
liberty
to
slave
,
of
use
an
uncontrouled
freedom
of
speech
towards
their
master
.
  
<EOS>
Our
little
army
,
which
consist
of
two
company
of
foot
,
be
now
arrive
at
the
place
where
they
be
to
halt
that
evening
.
<EOS>
the
serjeant
then
acquaint
his
lieutenant
,
who
be
the
command
officer
,
that
they
have
pick
up
two
fellow
in
that
day
's
march
,
one
of
which
,
he
say
,
be
as
fine
a
man
as
ever
he
see
(
mean
the
tippler
)
,
for
that
he
be
near
six
foot
,
well
proportion
,
and
strongly
limbe
;
and
the
other
(
mean
Jones
)
would
do
well
enough
for
the
rear
rank
.
  
<EOS>
the
new
soldier
be
now
produce
before
the
officer
,
who
have
examine
the
six
-
foot
man
,
he
be
first
produce
,
come
next
to
survey
Jones
:
at
the
first
sight
of
whom
,
the
lieutenant
could
not
help
show
some
surprize
;
for
besides
that
he
be
very
well
dressed
,
and
be
naturally
genteel
,
he
have
a
remarkable
air
of
dignity
in
his
look
,
which
be
rarely
see
among
the
vulgar
,
and
be
indeed
not
inseparably
annex
to
the
feature
of
their
superior
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
the
lieutenant
,
"
my
serjeant
inform
me
that
you
be
desirous
of
enlist
in
the
company
I
have
at
present
under
my
command
;
if
so
,
sir
,
we
shall
very
gladly
receive
a
gentleman
who
promise
to
do
much
honour
to
the
company
by
bear
arm
in
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
answer
:
"
that
he
have
not
mention
anything
of
enlist
himself
;
that
he
be
most
zealously
attach
to
the
glorious
cause
for
which
they
be
go
to
fight
,
and
be
very
desirous
of
serve
as
a
volunteer
;
"
conclude
with
some
compliment
to
the
lieutenant
,
and
express
the
great
satisfaction
he
should
have
in
be
under
his
command
.
  
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
return
his
civility
,
commend
his
resolution
,
shake
him
by
the
hand
,
and
invite
him
to
dine
with
himself
and
the
rest
of
the
officer
.
    
<EOS>
the
adventure
of
a
company
of
officer
.
 
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
,
whom
we
mention
in
the
precede
chapter
,
and
who
command
this
party
,
be
now
near
sixty
year
of
age
.
<EOS>
He
have
enter
very
young
into
the
army
,
and
have
serve
in
the
capacity
of
an
ensign
at
the
battle
of
Tannieres
;
here
he
have
receive
two
wound
,
and
have
so
well
distinguished
himself
,
that
he
be
by
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
advanced
to
be
a
lieutenant
,
immediately
after
that
battle
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
commission
he
have
continue
ever
since
,
viz
.
,
near
forty
year
;
during
which
time
he
have
see
vast
number
prefer
over
his
head
,
and
have
now
the
mortification
to
be
command
by
boy
,
whose
father
be
at
nurse
when
he
first
enter
into
the
service
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
this
ill
success
in
his
profession
solely
owe
to
his
have
no
friend
among
the
man
in
power
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
misfortune
to
incur
the
displeasure
of
his
colonel
,
who
for
many
year
continue
in
the
command
of
this
regiment
.
<EOS>
nor
do
he
owe
the
implacable
ill
-
will
which
this
man
bear
him
to
any
neglect
or
deficiency
as
an
officer
,
nor
indeed
to
any
fault
in
himself
;
but
solely
to
the
indiscretion
of
his
wife
,
who
be
a
very
beautiful
woman
,
and
who
,
though
she
be
remarkably
fond
of
her
husband
,
would
not
purchase
his
preferment
at
the
expense
of
certain
favour
which
the
colonel
require
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
lieutenant
be
more
peculiarly
unhappy
in
this
,
that
while
he
feel
the
effect
of
the
enmity
of
his
colonel
,
he
neither
know
,
nor
suspect
,
that
he
really
bear
him
any
;
for
he
could
not
suspect
an
ill
-
will
for
which
he
be
not
conscious
of
give
any
cause
;
and
his
wife
,
fear
what
her
husband
's
nice
regard
to
his
honour
may
have
occasion
,
content
herself
with
preserve
her
virtue
without
enjoy
the
triumph
of
her
conquest
.
  
<EOS>
this
unfortunate
officer
(
for
<EOS>
so
I
think
he
may
be
call
)
<EOS>
have
many
good
quality
besides
his
merit
in
his
profession
;
for
he
be
a
religious
,
honest
,
good
-
natured
man
;
and
have
behave
so
well
in
his
command
,
that
he
be
highly
esteem
and
beloved
not
only
by
the
soldier
of
his
own
company
,
but
by
the
whole
regiment
.
  
<EOS>
the
other
officer
who
march
with
him
be
a
french
lieutenant
,
who
have
be
long
enough
out
of
France
to
forget
his
own
language
,
but
not
long
enough
in
England
to
learn
ours
,
so
that
he
really
speak
no
language
at
all
,
and
could
barely
make
himself
understand
on
the
most
ordinary
occasion
.
<EOS>
there
be
likewise
two
ensign
,
both
very
young
fellow
;
one
of
whom
have
be
breed
under
an
attorney
,
and
the
other
be
son
to
the
wife
of
a
nobleman
's
butler
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
dinner
be
end
,
Jones
inform
the
company
of
the
merriment
which
have
pass
among
the
soldier
upon
their
march
;
"
and
yet
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
their
vociferation
,
I
dare
swear
they
will
behave
more
like
Grecians
than
Trojans
when
they
come
to
the
enemy
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Grecians
and
Trojans
!
<EOS>
"
say
one
of
the
ensign
,
"
who
the
devil
be
they

abuse

I

no

can
engage
in

I
have
observe
,
in

I

that
no
soldier
have
fight
so
bravely

those

for

I
love

I
hope
,
as
well

any

the

now
wink

slily

smoke
the

smoke

<EOS>
then
turn
to
Jones

say
to
him
,
"
I
be
very
glad
,
sir

you
have
choose

should
at

take
a

you

I

you
have

may
I
crave
the
favour

college
?

"
Sir

"
answer
Jones
,
"
so
far
from
have
be

I
have
even
have
the
advantage

"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
sir

"
answer
Jones
,
"
it
be
as
possible
for
a
man
to
know
something
without

it
be

have
be

to

"
  
<EOS>
"
well

,
young

cry
the
lieutenant

<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
Northerton
,
you
have
better
let
him
alone
;
for
he
will
be
too
hard
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Northerton
do
not
very
well
relish
the
sarcasm
of
Jones
;
but
he
think
the
provocation
be
scarce
sufficient
to
justify
a
blow
,
or
a
rascal
,
or
scoundrel
,
which
be
the
only
repartee
that
suggest
themselves
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
therefore
,
silent
at
present
;
but
resolve
to
take
the
first
opportunity
of
return
the
jest
by
abuse
.
  
<EOS>
It
now
come
to
the
turn
of
Mr
Jones
to
give
a
toast
,
as
it
be
call
;
who
could
not
refrain
from
mention
his
dear
Sophia
.
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
he
do
the
more
readily
,
as
he
imagine
it
utterly
impossible
that
any
one
present
should
guess
the
person
he
mean
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
lieutenant
,
who
be
the
toast
-
master
,
be
not
content
with
Sophia
only
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
he
must
have
her
sir
-
name
;
upon
which
Jones
hesitate
a
little
,
and
presently
after
name
Miss
Sophia
Western
.
<EOS>
Ensign
Northerton
declare
he
would
not
drink
her
health
in
the
same
round
with
his
own
toast
,
unless
somebody
would
vouch
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
one
Sophy
Western
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
be
lie
with
by
half
the
young
fellow
at
Bath
;
and
perhaps
this
be
the
same
woman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Jones
very
solemnly
assure
him
of
the
contrary
;
assert
that
the
young
lady
he
name
be
one
of
great
fashion
and
fortune
.
"
<EOS>
ay
,
ay
,
"
say
the
ensign
,
"
and
<EOS>
so
she
be
:
<EOS>
d####n
me
,
it
be
the
same
woman
;
and
I
will
hold
half
a
dozen
of
Burgundy
,
Tom
French
of
our
regiment
bring
her
into
company
with
us
at
any
tavern
in
Bridges
-
street
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
proceed
to
describe
her
person
exactly
(
for
he
have
see
her
with
her
aunt
)
,
and
conclude
with
say
,
"
that
her
father
have
a
great
estate
in
Somersetshire
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
tenderness
of
lover
can
ill
brook
the
least
jest
with
the
name
of
their
mistress
.
<EOS>
however
,
Jones
,
though
he
have
enough
of
the
lover
and
of
the
heroe
too
in
his
disposition
,
do
not
resent
these
slander
as
hastily
as
,
perhaps
,
he
ought
to
have
do
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
have
see
but
little
of
this
kind
of
wit
,
he
do
not
readily
understand
it
,
and
for
a
long
time
imagine
Mr
Northerton
have
really
mistake
his
charmer
for
some
other
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
turn
to
the
ensign
with
a
stern
aspect
,
he
say
,
"
pray
,
sir
,
chuse
some
other
subject
for
your
wit
;
for
I
promise
you
I
will
bear
no
jesting
with
this
lady
's
character
.
"
<EOS>
"
Jesting
!
"
<EOS>
cry
the
other
,
"
d####n
me
<EOS>
if
ever
I
be
more
in
earnest
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
Tom
French
of
our
regiment
have
both
her
and
her
aunt
at
Bath
.
"
<EOS>
"
then
I
must
tell
you
in
earnest
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
that
you
be
one
of
the
most
impudent
rascal
upon
earth
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
no
sooner
speak
these
word
,
than
the
ensign
,
together
with
a
volley
of
curse
,
discharge
a
bottle
full
at
the
head
of
Jones
,
which
hit
him
a
little
above
the
right
temple
,
bring
him
instantly
to
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
the
conqueror
perceive
the
enemy
to
lie
motionless
before
him
,
and
blood
beginning
to
flow
pretty
plentifully
from
his
wound
,
begin
now
to
think
of
quit
the
field
of
battle
,
where
no
more
honour
be
to
be
get
;
but
the
lieutenant
interpose
,
by
step
before
the
door
,
and
thus
cut
off
his
retreat
.
  
<EOS>
Northerton
be
very
importunate
with
the
lieutenant
for
his
liberty
;
urge
the
ill
consequence
of
his
stay
,
ask
him
,
what
he
could
have
do
less
?
"
<EOS>
zounds
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
"
I
be
but
in
jest
with
the
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
never
hear
any
harm
of
Miss
Western
in
my
life
.
"
<EOS>
"
have
not
you
?
"
say
the
lieutenant
;
"
then
you
richly
deserve
to
be
hang
,
as
well
for
make
such
jest
,
as
for
use
such
a
weapon
:
you
be
my
prisoner
,
sir
;
nor
shall
you
stir
from
hence
till
a
proper
guard
come
to
secure
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
such
an
ascendant
have
our
lieutenant
over
this
ensign
,
that
all
that
fervency
of
courage
which
have
level
our
poor
heroe
with
the
floor
,
would
scarce
have
animate
the
say
ensign
to
have
draw
his
sword
against
the
lieutenant
,
have
he
then
have
one
dangle
at
his
side
:
but
all
the
sword
be
hang
up
in
the
room
,
be
,
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
fray
,
secure
by
the
french
officer
.
<EOS>
so
that
Mr
Northerton
be
oblige
to
attend
the
final
issue
of
this
affair
.
  
<EOS>
the
french
gentleman
and
Mr
Adderly
,
at
the
desire
of
their
commanding
officer
,
have
raise
up
the
body
of
Jones
,
but
as
they
could
perceive
but
little
(
if
any
)
sign
of
life
in
him
,
they
again
let
him
fall
,
adderly
damn
him
for
have
blooded
his
wastecoat
;
and
the
Frenchman
declare
,
"
Begar
,
me
no
tush
the
Engliseman
de

:
<EOS>
me
have
hear

<EOS>
what
you
call
,
hang
up

tush

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
the
good
lieutenant
apply
himself
to
the
door
,
he
apply
himself
likewise
to
the
bell
;
and
the
drawer
immediately
attend
<EOS>
,
he
dispatch
him
for
a
file
of
musqueteer
and
a
surgeon
.
<EOS>
these
command
,
together
with
the
drawer
's
report
of
what
he
have
himself
see
,
not
only
produce
the
soldier
,
but
presently
draw
up
the
landlord
of
the
house
,
his
wife
,
and
servant
,
and
,
indeed
,
every
one
else
who
happen
at
that
time
to
be
in
the
inn
.
  
<EOS>
to
describe
every
particular
,
and
to
relate
the
whole
conversation
of
the
ensue
scene
,
be
not
within
my
power
,
unless
I
have
forty
pen
,
and
could
,
at
once
,
write
with
them
all
together
,
as
the
company
now
speak
.
<EOS>
the
reader
must
,
therefore
,
content
himself
with
the
most
remarkable
incident
,
and
perhaps
he
may
very
well
excuse
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
thing
do
be
secure
the
body
of
Northerton
,
who
be
deliver
into
the
custody
of
six
man
with
a
corporal
at
their
head
,
be
by
them
conduct
from
a
place
which
he
be
very
willing
to
leave
,
but
it
be
unluckily
to
a
place
<EOS>
whither
he
be
very
unwilling
to
go
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
so
whimsical
be
the
desire
of
ambition
,
the
very
moment
this
youth
have
attain
the
above
-
mention
honour
,
he
would
have
be
well
contented
to
have
retire
to
some
corner
of
the
world
,
where
the
fame
of
it
should
never
have
reach
his
ear
.
  
<EOS>
It
surprize
us
,
and
so
perhaps
,
it
may
the
reader
,
that
the
lieutenant
,
a
worthy
and
good
man
,
should
have
apply
his
chief
care
,
rather
to
secure
the
offender
,
than
to
preserve
the
life
of
the
wound
person
.
<EOS>
We
mention
this
observation
,
not
with
any
view
of
pretend
to
account
for
so
odd
a
behaviour
,
but
lest
some
critic
should
hereafter
plume
himself
on
discover
it
.
<EOS>
We
would
have
these
gentleman
know
we
can
see
what
be
odd
in
character
as
well
as
themselves
,
but
it
be
our
business
to
relate
fact
as
they
be
;
which
,
when
we
have
do
,
it
be
the
part
of
the
learned
and
sagacious
reader
to
consult
that
original
book
of
nature
,
whence
<EOS>
every
passage
in
our
work
be
transcribe
,
though
we
quote
not
always
the
particular
page
for
its
authority
.
  
<EOS>
the
company
which
now
arrive
be
of
a
different
disposition
.
<EOS>
They
suspend
their
curiosity
concern
the
person
of
the
ensign
,
till
they
should
see
him
hereafter
in
a
more
engaging
attitude
.
<EOS>
at
present
,
their
whole
concern
and
attention
be
employ
about
the
bloody
object
on
the
floor
;
which
be
place
upright
in
a
chair
,
soon
begin
to
discover
some
symptom
of
life
and
motion
.
<EOS>
these
be
no
sooner
perceive
by
the
company
(
for
Jones
be
at
first
generally
conclude
to
be
dead
)
than
they
all
fall
at
once
to
prescribe
for
him
(
for
as
none
of
the
physical
order
be
present
,
every
one
there
take
that
office
upon
him
)
.
  
<EOS>
bleeding
be
the
unanimous
voice
of
the
whole
room
;
but
unluckily
there
be
no
operator
at
hand
;
every
one
then
cry
,
"
call
the
barber
;
"
but
none
stir
a
step
.
<EOS>
several
cordial
be
likewise
prescribe
in
the
same
ineffective
manner
;
till
the
landlord
order
up
a
tankard
of
strong
beer
,
with
a
toast
,
which
he
say
be
the
good
cordial
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
the
person
principally
assistant
on
this
occasion
,
indeed
the
only
one
who
do
any
service
,
or
seem
likely
to
do
any
,
be
the
landlady
<EOS>
:
she
cut
off
some
of
her
hair
,
and
apply
it
to
the
wound
to
stop
the
blood
;
she
fall
to
chafe
the
youth
's
temple
with
her
hand
;
and
have
expr
great
contempt
for
her
husband
's
prescription
of
beer
,
she
despatch
one
of
her
maid
to
her
own
closet
for
a
bottle
of
brandy
,
of
which
,
as
soon
as
it
be
bring
,
she
prevail
on
Jones
,
who
be
just
return
to
his
sense
,
to
drink
a
very
large
and
plentiful
draught
.
  
<EOS>
soon
afterwards
arrive
the
surgeon
,
who
have
view
the
wound
,
have
shake
his
head
,
and
blame
everything
which
be
do
,
order
his
patient
instantly
to
bed
;
in
which
place
we
think
proper
to
leave
him
some
time
to
his
repose
,
and
shall
here
,
therefore
,
put
an
end
to
this
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
contain
the
great
address
of
the
landlady
,
the
great
learning
of
a
surgeon
,
and
the
solid
skill
in
casuistry
of
the
worthy
lieutenant
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
wounded
man
be
carry
to
his
bed
,
and
the
house
begin
again
to
clear
up
from
the
hurry
which
this
accident
have
occasion
,
the
landlady
thus
address
the
command
officer
:
"
I
be
afraid
,
sir
,
"
say
she
,
"
this
young
man
do
not
behave
himself
as
well
as
he
should
do
to
your
honour
;
and
if
he
have
be
kill
,
I
suppose
he
have
<EOS>
but
his
desart
:
to
be
sure
,
when
gentleman
admit
inferior
parson
into
their
company
<EOS>
,
they
oft
to
keep
their
distance
;
but
,
as
my
first
husband
use
to
say
,
few
of
'em
know
how
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
be
sure
I
should
not
have
suffer
any
fellow
to
include
themselves
into
gentleman
's
company
;
but
I
thoft
he
have
be
an
officer
himself
,
till
the
serjeant
tell
me
he
be
but
a
recruit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Landlady
,
"
answer
the
lieutenant
,
"
you
mistake
the
whole
matter
.
<EOS>
the
young
man
behave
himself
extremely
well
,
and
be
,
I
believe
,
a
much
well
gentleman
than
the
ensign
who
abuse
him
.
<EOS>
if
the
young
fellow
die
,
the
man
who
strike
him
will
have
most
reason
to
be
sorry
for
it
:
for
the
regiment
will
get
rid
of
a
very
troublesome
fellow
,
who
be
a
scandal
to
the
army
;
and
if
he
escape
from
the
hand
of
justice
,
blame
me
,
madam
,
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
!
<EOS>
ay
!
<EOS>
good
lack
-
a
-
day
!
"
<EOS>
say
the
landlady
;
"
who
could
have
thoft
it
?
<EOS>
ay
,
ay
,
ay
,
I
be
satisfied
your
honour
will
see
justice
do
;
and
to
be
sure
it
oft
to
be
to
every
one
.
<EOS>
gentleman
oft
not
to
kill
poor
folk
without
answer
for
it
.
<EOS>
a
poor
man
hath
a
soul
to
be
save
,
as
well
as
his
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
madam
,
"
say
the
lieutenant
,
"
you
do
the
volunteer
wrong
<EOS>
:
I
dare
swear
he
be
more
of
a
gentleman
than
the
officer
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
!
"
cry
the
landlady
;
"
why
,
look
you
there
,
now
:
<EOS>
well
,
my
first
husband
be
a
wise
man
;
he
use
to
say
,
you
can
not
always
know
the
inside
by
the
outside
.
<EOS>
nay
,
that
may
have
be
well
enough
too
;
for
I
never
saw'd
him
till
he
be
all
over
blood
.
<EOS>
who
would
have
thoft
it
?
<EOS>
mayhap
,
some
young
gentleman
cross
in
love
.
<EOS>
good
lack
-
a
-
day
,
if
he
should
die
,
what
a
concern
it
will
be
to
his
parent
!
<EOS>
why
,
sure
the
devil
must
possess
the
wicked
wretch
to
do
such
an
act
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
he
be
a
scandal
to
the
army
,
as
your
honour
say
;
for
most
of
the
gentleman
of
the
army
that
ever
I
see
,
be
quite
different
sort
of
people
,
and
look
as
if
they
would
scorn
to
spill
any
christian
blood
as
much
as
any
man
:
I
mean
,
that
is
,
in
a
civil
way
,
as
my
first
husband
use
to
say
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
when
they
come
into
the
war
,
there
must
be
bloodshe
:
but
that
they
be
not
to
be
blame
for
.
<EOS>
the
more
of
our
enemy
they
kill
there
,
the
well
:
<EOS>
and
I
wish
,
with
all
my
heart
,
they
could
kill
every
mother
's
son
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
o
fie
,
madam
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
lieutenant
,
smile
;
"
all
be
rather
too
bloody
-
minded
a
wish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
,
sir
,
"
answer
she
;
"
I
be
not
at
all
bloody
-
minded
,
only
to
our
enemy
;
and
there
be
no
harm
in
that
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
it
be
natural
for
us
to
wish
our
enemy
dead
,
that
the
war
may
be
at
an
end
,
and
our
taxis
be
lower
;
for
it
be
a
dreadful
thing
to
pay
as
we
do
.
<EOS>
why
now
,
there
be
above
forty
shilling
for
window
-
light
,
and
yet
we
have
stopt
up
all
we
could
<EOS>
;
we
have
almost
blind
the
house
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
say
I
to
the
exciseman
,
say
I
,
I
think
you
oft
to
favour
us
<EOS>
;
I
be
sure
we
be
very
good
friend
to
the
government
:
<EOS>
and
so
we
be
for
sartain
,
for
we
pay
a
mint
of
money
to
"
um
.
<EOS>
and
yet
I
often
think
to
myself
the
government
doth
not
imagine
itself
more
obliged
to
us
,
than
to
those
that
do
not
pay
"
um
a
farthing
.
<EOS>
ay
,
ay
,
it
be
the
way
of
the
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
proceed
in
this
manner
when
the
surgeon
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
immediately
ask
how
his
patient
do
.
<EOS>
but
he
resolve
him
only
by
say
,
"
well
,
I
believe
,
than
he
would
have
be
by
this
time
,
if
I
have
not
be
call
;
and
even
as
it
be
,
perhaps
it
would
have
be
lucky
if
I
could
have
be
call
sooner
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
sir
,
"
say
the
lieutenant
,
"
the
skull
be
not
fracture
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hum
,
"
cry
the
surgeon
:
<EOS>
"
fracture
be
not
always
the
most
dangerous
symptom
.
<EOS>
contusion
and
laceration
be
often
attend
with
bad
phaenomena
,
and
with
more
fatal
consequence
,
than
fracture
.
<EOS>
People
who
know
nothing
of
the
matter
conclude
,
if
the
skull
be
not
fracture
,
all
be
well
;
whereas
,
I
have
rather
see
a
man
's
skull
break
all
to
piece
,
than
some
contusion
I
have
meet
with
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
say
the
lieutenant
,
"
there
be
no
such
symptom
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
symptom
,
"
answer
the
surgeon
,
"
be
not
always
regular
nor
constant
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
very
unfavourable
symptom
in
the
morning
change
to
favourable
one
at
noon
,
and
return
to
unfavourable
again
at
night
.
<EOS>
of
wound
,
indeed
,
it
be
rightly
and
truly
say
,
Nemo
repente
fuit
turpissimus
.
<EOS>
I
be
once
,
I
remember
,
call
to
a
patient
who
have
receive
a
violent
contusion
in
his
tibia
,
by
which
the
exterior
cutis
be
lacerate
,
so
that
there
be
a
profuse
sanguinary
discharge
;
and
the
interior
membrane
be
so
divellicated
,
that
the
os
or
bone
very
plainly
appear
through
the
aperture
of
the
vulnus
or
wound
.
<EOS>
some
febrile
symptom
intervene
at
the
same
time
(
for
the
pulse
be
exuberant
and
indicate
much
phlebotomy
)
,
I
apprehend
an
immediate
mortification
.
<EOS>
to
prevent
which
,
I
presently
make
a
large
orifice
in
the
vein
of
the
left
arm
,
whence
<EOS>
I
draw
twenty
ounce
of
blood
;
which
I
expect
to
have
find
extremely
sizy
and
glutinous
,
or
indeed
coagulate
,
as
it
be
in
pleuretic
complaint
;
but
,
to
my
surprize
,
it
appear
rosy
and
florid
,
and
its
consistency
differ
little
from
the
blood
of
those
in
perfect
health
.
<EOS>
I
then
apply
a
fomentation
to
the
part
,
which
highly
answer
the
intention
;
and
after
three
or
four
time
dress
,
the
wound
begin
to
discharge
a
thick
pus
or
matter
,
by
which
mean
the
cohesion
 
<EOS>
but
perhaps
I
do
not
make
myself
perfectly
well
understand
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
really
,
"
answer
the
lieutenant
,
"
I
can
not
say
I
understand
a
syllable
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
"
say
the
surgeon
,
"
then
I
shall
not
tire
your
patience
;
in
short
,
within
six
week
my
patient
be
able
to
walk
upon
his
leg
as
perfectly
as
he
could
have
do
before
he
receive
the
contusion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
sir
,
"
say
the
lieutenant
,
"
you
would
be
so
kind
only
to
inform
me
,
whether
the
wound
this
young
gentleman
hath
have
the
misfortune
to
receive
,
be
likely
to
prove
mortal
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
answer
the
surgeon
,
"
to
say
whether
a
wound
will
prove
mortal
or
not
at
first
dressing
,
would
be
very
weak
and
foolish
presumption
:
we
be
all
mortal
,
and
symptom
often
occur
in
a
cure
which
the
great
of
our
profession
could
never
foresee
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
do
you
think
him
in
danger
?
"
say
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
in
danger
!
<EOS>
ay
,
surely
,
"
cry
the
doctor
:
"
who
be
there
among
us
,
who
,
in
the
most
perfect
health
,
can
be
say
not
to
be
in
danger
?
<EOS>
Can
a
man
,
therefore
,
with
so
bad
a
wound
as
this
be
say
to
be
out
of
danger
?
<EOS>
all
I
can
say
at
present
be
,
that
it
be
well
I
be
call
as
I
be
,
and
perhaps
it
would
have
be
well
if
I
have
be
call
sooner
.
<EOS>
I
will
see
him
again
early
in
the
morning
;
and
in
the
meantime
let
him
be
keep
extremely
quiet
,
and
drink
liberally
of
water
-
gruel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
will
not
you
allow
him
sack
-
whey
?
"
say
the
landlady
.
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
,
sack
-
whey
,
"
cry
the
doctor
,
"
<EOS>
if
you
will
,
provide
it
be
very
small
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
a
little
chicken
broth
too
?
"
add
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
chicken
broth
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
be
very
good
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
May
not
I
make
him
some
jelly
too
?
"
say
the
landlady
.
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
,
"
answer
the
doctor
,
"
jelly
be
very
good
for
wound
,
for
they
promote
cohesion
.
"
<EOS>
and
indeed
it
be
lucky
she
have
not
name
soup
or
high
sauce
,
for
the
doctor
would
have
comply
,
rather
than
have
lose
the
custom
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
be
no
sooner
go
,
than
the
landlady
begin
to
trumpet
forth
his
fame
to
the
lieutenant
,
who
have
not
,
from
their
short
acquaintance
,
conceive
quite
so
favourable
an
opinion
of
his
physical
ability
as
the
good
woman
,
and
all
the
neighbourhood
,
entertain
(
and
perhaps
very
rightly
)
;
for
though
I
be
afraid
the
doctor
be
a
little
of
a
coxcomb
,
he
may
be
nevertheless
very
much
of
a
surgeon
.
  
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
have
collect
from
the
learn
discourse
of
the
surgeon
that
Mr
Jones
be
in
great
danger
,
give
order
for
keep
Mr
Northerton
under
a
very
strict
guard
,
design
in
the
morning
to
attend
him
to
a
justice
of
peace
,
and
to
commit
the
conduct
the
troop
to
Gloucester
to
the
french
lieutenant
,
who
,
though
he
could
neither
read
,
write
,
nor
speak
any
language
,
be
,
however
,
a
good
officer
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
evening
,
our
commander
send
a
message
to
Mr
Jones
,
that
if
a
visit
would
not
be
troublesome
,
he
would
wait
on
him
.
<EOS>
this
civility
be
very
kindly
and
thankfully
receive
by
Jones
,
and
the
lieutenant
accordingly
go
up
to
his
room
,
where
he
find
the
wounded
man
much
better
than
he
expect
;
nay
,
Jones
assure
his
friend
,
that
if
he
have
not
receive
express
order
to
the
contrary
from
the
surgeon
,
he
should
have
get
up
long
ago
;
for
he
appear
to
himself
to
be
as
well
as
ever
,
and
feel
no
other
inconvenience
from
his
wound
but
an
extreme
soreness
on
that
side
of
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
very
glad
,
"
quoth
the
lieutenant
,
"
if
you
be
as
well
as
you
fancy
yourself
,
for
then
you
could
be
able
to
do
yourself
justice
immediately
;
for
when
a
matter
can
not
be
make
up
,
as
in
case
of
a
blow
,
the
sooner
you
take
him
out
the
well
;
but
I
be
afraid
you
think
yourself
better
than
you
be
,
and
he
would
have
too
much
advantage
over
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
,
however
,
"
answer
Jones
,
"
if
you
please
,
and
will
be
so
kind
to
lend
me
a
sword
,
for
I
have
none
here
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
sword
be
heartily
at
your
service
,
my
dear
boy
,
"
cry
the
lieutenant
,
kiss
him
;
"
you
be
a
brave
lad
,
and
I
love
your
spirit
;
but
I
fear
your
strength
;
for
such
a
blow
,
and
so
much
loss
of
blood
,
must
have
very
much
weaken
you
;
and
though
you
feel
no
want
of
strength
in
your
bed
,
yet
you
most
probably
would
after
a
thrust
or
two
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
consent
to
your
take
him
out
tonight
;
but
I
hope
you
will
be
able
to
come
up
with
us
before
we
get
many
day
'
march
advance
;
and
I
give
you
my
honour
you
shall
have
satisfaction
,
or
<EOS>
the
man
who
hath
injure
you
shall
not
stay
in
our
regiment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
it
be
possible
to
decide
this
matter
to
-
night
:
now
you
have
mention
it
to
me
<EOS>
,
I
shall
not
be
able
to
rest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
never
think
of
it
,
"
return
the
other
:
"
a
few
day
will
make
no
difference
.
<EOS>
the
wound
of
honour
be
not
like
those
in
your
body
:
they
suffer
nothing
by
the
delay
of
cure
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
altogether
as
well
for
you
to
receive
satisfaction
a
week
hence
as
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
suppose
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
I
should
grow
bad
,
and
die
of
the
consequence
of
my
present
wound
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
your
honour
,
"
answer
the
lieutenant
,
"
will
require
no
reparation
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
myself
will
do
justice
to
your
character
,
and
testify
to
the
world
your
intention
to
have
act
properly
,
if
you
have
recover
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
still
,
"
reply
Jones
,
"
I
be
concern
at
the
delay
.
<EOS>
I
be
almost
afraid
to
mention
it
to
you
who
be
a
soldier
;
but
though
I
have
be
a
very
wild
young
fellow
,
still
in
my
most
serious
moment
,
and
at
the
bottom
,
I
be
really
a
Christian
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
be
I
too
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
"
say
the
officer
;
"
and
so
zealous
a
one
,
that
I
be
pleased
with
you
at
dinner
for
take
up
the
cause
of
your
religion
;
<EOS>
and
I
be
a
little
offended
with
you
now
,
young
gentleman
,
that
you
should
express
a
fear
of
declare
your
faith
before
any
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
how
terrible
must
it
be
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
to
any
one
who
be
really
a
Christian
,
to
cherish
malice
in
his
breast
,
in
opposition
to
the
command
of
Him
who
hath
expressly
forbid
it
?
<EOS>
how
can
I
bear
to
do
this
on
a
sick
-
bed
?
<EOS>
or
how
shall
I
make
up
my
account
,
with
such
an
article
as
this
in
my
bosom
against
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
believe
there
be
such
a
command
,
"
cry
the
lieutenant
;
"
but
a
man
of
honour
can
not
keep
it
.
<EOS>
and
you
must
be
a
man
of
honour
,
if
you
will
be
in
the
army
.
<EOS>
I
remember
I
once
put
the
case
to
our
chaplain
over
a
bowl
of
punch
,
and
he
confess
there
be
much
difficulty
in
it
;
but
he
say
,
he
hope
there
may
be
a
latitude
grant
to
soldier
in
this
one
instance
;
and
to
be
sure
it
be
our
duty
to
hope
so
;
for
who
would
bear
to
live
without
his
honour
?
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
my
dear
boy
,
be
a
good
Christian
as
long
as
you
live
;
but
be
a
man
of
honour
too
,
and
never
put
up
an
affront
;
not
all
the
book
,
nor
all
the
parson
in
the
world
,
shall
ever
persuade
me
to
that
.
<EOS>
I
love
my
religion
very
well
,
but
I
love
my
honour
more
.
<EOS>
there
must
be
some
mistake
in
the
wording
the
text
,
or
in
the
translation
,
or
in
the
understanding
it
,
or
somewhere
or
other
.
<EOS>
but
however
that
be
,
a
man
must
run
the
risque
,
for
he
must
preserve
his
honour
.
<EOS>
so
compose
yourself
to
-
night
,
and
I
promise
you
you
shall
have
an
opportunity
of
do
yourself
justice
.
<EOS>
"
here
he
give
Jones
a
hearty
buss
,
shake
him
by
the
hand
,
and
take
his
leave
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
the
lieutenant
's
reasoning
be
very
satisfactory
to
himself
,
it
be
not
entirely
so
to
his
friend
.
<EOS>
Jones
therefore
,
have
revolve
this
matter
much
in
his
thought
,
at
last
come
to
a
resolution
,
which
the
reader
will
find
in
the
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
a
most
dreadful
chapter
indeed
;
and
which
few
reader
ought
to
venture
upon
in
an
evening
,
especially
when
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Jones
swallow
a
large
mess
of
chicken
,
or
rather
cock
,
broth
,
with
a
very
good
appetite
,
as
indeed
he
would
have
do
the
cock
it
be
make
of
,
with
a
pound
of
bacon
into
the
bargain
;
and
now
,
find
in
himself
no
deficiency
of
either
health
or
spirit
,
he
resolve
to
get
up
and
seek
his
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
but
first
he
send
for
the
serjeant
,
who
be
his
first
acquaintance
among
these
military
gentleman
.
<EOS>
unluckily
that
worthy
officer
have
,
in
a
literal
sense
,
take
his
fill
of
liquor
,
<EOS>
have
be
some
time
retire
to
his
bolster
,
where
he
be
snore
so
loud
that
it
be
not
easy
to
convey
a
noise
in
at
his
ear
capable
of
drown
that
which
issue
from
his
nostril
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
as
Jones
persist
in
his
desire
of
see
him
,
a
vociferous
drawer
at
length
find
mean
to
disturb
his
slumber
,
and
to
acquaint
him
with
the
message
.
<EOS>
of
which
the
serjeant
be
no
sooner
make
sensible
,
than
he
arise
from
his
bed
,
and
have
his
clothe
already
on
,
immediately
attend
.
<EOS>
Jones
do
not
think
fit
to
acquaint
the
serjeant
with
his
design
;
though
he
may
have
do
it
with
great
safety
,
for
the
halberdier
be
himself
a
man
of
honour
,
and
have
kill
his
man
.
<EOS>
He
would
therefore
have
faithfully
keep
this
secret
,
or
indeed
any
other
which
no
reward
be
publish
for
discover
.
<EOS>
but
as
Jones
know
not
those
virtue
in
so
short
an
acquaintance
,
his
caution
be
perhaps
prudent
and
commendable
enough
.
  
<EOS>
He
begin
therefore
by
acquaint
the
serjeant
,
that
as
he
be
now
enter
into
the
army
,
he
be
ashamed
of
be
without
what
be
perhaps
the
most
necessary
implement
of
a
soldier
;
<EOS>
namely
,
a
sword
;
add
,
that
he
should
be
infinitely
oblige
to
him
,
if
he
could
procure
one
.
"
<EOS>
for
which
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
will
give
you
any
reasonable
price
;
nor
do
I
insist
upon
its
be
silver
-
hilte
;
only
a
good
blade
,
and
such
as
may
become
a
soldier
's
thigh
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
serjeant
,
who
well
know
what
have
happen
,
and
have
hear
that
Jones
be
in
a
very
dangerous
condition
,
immediately
conclude
,
from
such
a
message
,
at
such
a
time
of
night
,
and
from
a
man
in
such
a
situation
,
that
he
be
light
-
head
.
<EOS>
now
as
he
have
his
wit
(
to
use
that
word
in
its
common
signification
)
always
ready
,
he
bethink
himself
of
make
his
advantage
of
this
humour
in
the
sick
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
believe
I
can
fit
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
most
excellent
piece
of
stuff
by
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
indeed
silver
-
hilte
,
which
,
as
you
say
,
doth
not
become
a
soldier
;
but
the
handle
be
decent
enough
,
and
the
blade
one
of
the
good
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
blade
that
 
a
blade
that
 
in
short
,
I
will
fetch
it
you
this
instant
,
and
you
shall
see
it
and
handle
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
see
your
honour
so
well
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
be
instantly
return
with
the
sword
,
he
deliver
it
to
Jones
,
who
take
it
and
draw
it
;
and
then
tell
the
serjeant
it
would
do
very
well
,
and
bid
him
name
his
price
.
  
<EOS>
the
serjeant
now
begin
to
harangue
in
praise
of
his
good
.
<EOS>
He
say
(
nay
he
swear
very
heartily
)
,
"
that
the
blade
be
take
from
a
french
officer
,
of
very
high
rank
,
at
the
battle
of
Dettingen
.
<EOS>
I
take
it
myself
,
"
say
he
,
"
from
his
side
,
after
I
have
knock
him
o
'
the
head
.
<EOS>
the
hilt
be
a
golden
one
.
<EOS>
that
I
sell
to
one
of
our
fine
gentleman
;
for
there
be
some
of
them
,
<EOS>
an't
please
your
honour
,
who
value
the
hilt
of
a
sword
more
than
the
blade
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
the
other
stop
him
,
and
beg
him
to
name
a
price
.
<EOS>
the
serjeant
,
who
think
Jones
absolutely
out
of
his
sense
,
and
very
near
his
end
,
be
afraid
lest
he
should
injure
his
family
by
ask
too
little
.
<EOS>
however
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
he
content
himself
with
name
twenty
guinea
,
and
swear
he
would
not
sell
it
for
less
to
his
own
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
twenty
guinea
!
<EOS>
"
say
Jones
,
in
the
utmost
surprize
:
"
sure
you
think
I
be
mad
,
or
that
I
never
see
a
sword
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
twenty
guinea
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
imagine
you
would
endeavour
to
impose
upon
me
.
<EOS>
here
,
take
the
sword
 
<EOS>
no
,
now
I
think
on't
,
I
will
keep
it
myself
,
and
show
it
your
officer
in
the
morning
,
acquaint
him
,
at
the
same
time
,
what
a
price
you
ask
me
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
serjeant
,
as
we
have
say
,
have
always
his
wit
(
in
sensu
praedicto
)
about
him
,
and
now
plainly
see
that
Jones
be
not
in
the
condition
he
have
apprehend
him
to
be
;
he
now
,
therefore
,
counterfeit
as
great
surprize
as
the
other
have
show
,
and
say
,
"
I
be
certain
,
sir
,
I
have
not
ask
you
so
much
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
besides
,
you
be
to
consider
,
it
be
the
only
sword
I
have
,
and
I
must
run
the
risque
of
my
officer
's
displeasure
,
by
go
without
one
myself
.
<EOS>
and
truly
,
put
all
this
together
,
I
do
not
think
twenty
shilling
be
so
much
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Twenty
shilling
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Jones
;
"
why
,
you
just
now
ask
me
twenty
guinea
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
!
"
cry
the
serjeant
,
"
<EOS>
sure
your
honour
must
have
mistake
me
:
or
else
I
mistake
myself
 
<EOS>
and
indeed
I
be
<EOS>
but
half
awake
.
<EOS>
twenty
guinea
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
no
wonder
your
honour
fly
into
such
a
passion
.
<EOS>
I
say
twenty
guinea
too
.
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
I
mean
twenty
shilling
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
and
when
your
honour
come
to
consider
everything
,
I
hope
you
will
not
think
that
so
extravagant
a
price
.
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
true
,
you
may
buy
a
weapon
which
look
as
well
for
less
money
.
<EOS>
but
"
  
here
Jones
interrupt
him
,
say
,
"
I
will
be
so
far
from
make
any
word
with
you
,
that
I
will
give
you
a
shill
more
than
your
demand
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
give
him
a
guinea
,
bid
him
return
to
his
bed
,
and
wish
him
a
good
march
;
add
,
he
hope
to
overtake
them
before
the
division
reach
Worcester
.
  
<EOS>
the
serjeant
very
civilly
take
his
leave
,
fully
satisfied
with
his
merchandize
,
and
not
a
little
pleased
with
his
dexterous
recovery
from
that
false
step
into
which
his
opinion
of
the
sick
man
's
light
-
headedness
have
betray
him
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
serjeant
be
depart
,
Jones
rise
from
his
bed
,
and
dress
himself
entirely
,
put
on
even
his
coat
,
which
,
as
its
colour
be
white
,
show
very
visibly
the
stream
of
blood
which
have
flow
down
it
;
and
now
,
have
grasp
his
new
-
purchase
sword
in
his
hand
,
he
be
go
to
issue
forth
,
when
the
thought
of
what
he
be
about
to
undertake
lay
suddenly
hold
of
him
,
and
he
begin
to
reflect
that
in
a
few
minute
he
may
possibly
deprive
a
human
being
of
life
,
or
may
lose
his
own
.
"
<EOS>
very
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
in
what
cause
do
I
venture
my
life
?
<EOS>
why
,
in
that
of
my
honour
.
<EOS>
and
who
be
this
human
being
?
<EOS>
a
rascal
who
hath
injure
and
insult
me
without
provocation
.
<EOS>
but
be
not
revenge
forbid
by
Heaven
?
<EOS>
yes
,
but
it
be
enjoin
by
the
world
.
<EOS>
well
,
but
shall
I
obey
the
world
in
opposition
to
the
express
command
of
Heaven
?
<EOS>
Shall
I
incur
the
Divine
displeasure
rather
than
be
call
 
ha
 
coward
 
scoundrel
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
think
no
more
;
I
be
resolve
,
and
must
fight
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
clock
have
now
strike
twelve
,
and
every
one
in
the
house
be
in
their
bed
,
except
the
centinel
who
stand
to
guard
Northerton
,
when
Jones
softly
open
his
door
,
issue
forth
in
pursuit
of
his
enemy
,
of
whose
place
of
confinement
he
have
receive
a
perfect
description
from
the
drawer
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
easy
to
conceive
a
much
more
tremendous
figure
than
he
now
exhibit
.
<EOS>
He
have
on
,
as
we
have
say
,
a
light
-
colour
coat
,
cover
with
stream
of
blood
.
<EOS>
His
face
,
which
miss
that
very
blood
,
as
well
as
twenty
ounce
more
draw
from
him
by
the
surgeon
,
be
pallid
.
<EOS>
round
his
head
be
a
quantity
of
bandage
,
not
unlike
a
turban
.
<EOS>
in
the
right
hand
he
carry
a
sword
,
and
in
the
left
a
candle
.
<EOS>
so
that
the
bloody
Banquo
be
not
worthy
to
be
compare
to
him
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
I
believe
a
more
dreadful
apparition
be
never
raise
in
a
church
-
yard
,
nor
in
the
imagination
of
any
good
people
meet
in
a
winter
evening
over
a
Christmas
fire
in
Somersetshire
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
centinel
first
see
our
heroe
approach
,
his
hair
begin
gently
to
lift
up
his
grenadier
cap
;
and
in
the
same
instant
his
knee
fall
to
blow
with
each
other
.
<EOS>
presently
his
whole
body
be
seize
with
bad
than
an
ague
fit
.
<EOS>
He
then
fire
his
piece
,
and
fall
flat
on
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
whether
fear
or
courage
be
the
occasion
of
his
firing
,
or
whether
he
take
aim
at
the
object
of
his
terror
,
I
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
if
he
do
,
however
,
he
have
the
good
fortune
to
miss
his
man
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
see
the
fellow
fall
,
guess
the
cause
of
his
fright
,
at
which
he
could
not
forbear
smile
,
not
in
the
least
reflect
on
the
danger
from
which
he
have
just
escape
.
<EOS>
He
then
pass
by
the
fellow
,
who
still
continue
in
the
posture
in
which
he
fall
,
and
enter
the
room
where
Northerton
,
as
he
have
hear
,
be
confine
.
<EOS>
here
,
in
a
solitary
situation
,
he
find
 
an
empty
quart
pot
stand
on
the
table
,
on
which
some
beer
be
spill
,
it
look
as
if
the
room
have
lately
be
inhabit
;
but
at
present
it
be
entirely
vacant
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
then
apprehend
it
may
lead
to
some
other
apartment
;
but
upon
search
all
round
it
,
he
could
perceive
no
other
door
than
that
at
which
he
enter
,
and
where
the
centinel
have
be
post
.
<EOS>
He
then
proceed
to
call
Northerton
several
time
by
his
name
;
but
no
one
answer
;
nor
do
this
serve
to
any
other
purpose
than
to
confirm
the
centinel
in
his
terror
,
who
be
now
convince
that
the
volunteer
be
dead
of
his
wound
,
and
that
his
ghost
be
come
in
search
of
the
murderer
:
he
now
lie
in
all
the
agony
of
horror
;
and
I
wish
,
with
all
my
heart
,
some
of
those
actor
who
be
hereafter
to
represent
a
man
fright
out
of
his
wit
have
see
him
,
that
they
may
be
teach
to
copy
nature
,
instead
of
perform
several
antic
trick
and
gesture
,
for
the
entertainment
and
applause
of
the
gallery
.
  
<EOS>
perceive
the
bird
be
fly
,
at
least
despair
to
find
him
,
and
rightly
apprehend
that
the
report
of
the
firelock
would
alarm
the
whole
house
,
our
heroe
now
blow
out
his
candle
,
and
gently
steal
back
again
to
his
chamber
,
and
to
his
bed
;
whither
he
would
not
have
be
able
to
have
get
undiscovered
,
have
any
other
person
be
on
the
same
staircase
,
save
only
one
gentleman
who
be
confine
to
his
bed
by
the
gout
;
for
before
he
could
reach
the
door
to
his
chamber
,
the
hall
where
the
centinel
have
be
post
be
half
full
of
people
,
some
in
their
shirt
,
and
other
not
half
dr
,
all
very
earnestly
enquire
of
each
other
what
be
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
the
soldier
be
now
find
lie
in
the
same
place
and
posture
in
which
we
just
now
leave
him
.
<EOS>
several
immediately
apply
themselves
to
raise
him
,
and
some
conclude
him
dead
;
but
they
presently
see
their
mistake
,
for
he
not
only
struggle
with
those
who
lay
their
hand
on
him
,
but
fall
a
roaring
like
a
bull
.
<EOS>
in
reality
,
he
imagine
so
many
spirit
or
devil
be
handle
him
;
for
his
imagination
be
possess
with
the
horror
of
an
apparition
,
convert
every
object
he
see
or
feel
into
nothing
but
ghost
and
spectre
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
he
be
overpower
by
number
,
and
get
upon
his
leg
;
when
candle
be
bring
,
and
see
two
or
three
of
his
comrade
present
,
he
come
a
little
to
himself
;
but
when
they
ask
him
what
be
the
matter
?
<EOS>
he
answer
,
"
I
be
a
dead
man
,
that
be
all
,
I
be
a
dead
man
,
I
can
not
recover
it
,
I
have
see
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
what
hast
thou
see
,
Jack
?
"
say
one
of
the
soldier
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
have
see
the
young
volunteer
that
be
kill
yesterday
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
imprecate
the
most
heavy
curse
on
himself
,
if
he
have
not
see
the
volunteer
,
all
over
blood
,
vomit
fire
out
of
his
mouth
and
nostril
,
pass
by
him
into
the
chamber
where
Ensign
Northerton
be
,
and
then
seize
the
ensign
by
the
throat
,
fly
away
with
him
in
a
clap
of
thunder
.
  
<EOS>
this
relation
meet
with
a
gracious
reception
from
the
audience
.
<EOS>
all
the
woman
present
believe
it
firmly
,
and
pray
Heaven
to
defend
them
from
murder
.
<EOS>
amongst
the
man
too
,
many
have
faith
in
the
story
;
but
other
turn
it
into
derision
and
ridicule
;
and
a
serjeant
who
be
present
answer
very
coolly
,
"
young
man
,
you
will
hear
more
of
this
,
for
go
to
sleep
and
dream
on
your
post
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
soldier
reply
,
"
You
may
punish
me
if
you
please
;
but
I
be
as
broad
awake
as
I
be
now
;
and
the
devil
carry
me
away
,
as
he
hath
the
ensign
,
if
I
do
not
see
the
dead
man
,
as
I
tell
you
,
with
eye
as
big
and
as
fiery
as
two
large
flambeaux
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
commander
of
the
force
,
and
the
commander
of
the
house
,
be
now
both
arrive
;
for
the
former
be
awake
at
the
time
,
and
hear
the
centinel
fire
his
piece
,
think
it
his
duty
to
rise
immediately
,
though
he
have
no
great
apprehension
of
any
mischief
;
whereas
the
apprehension
of
the
latter
be
much
great
,
lest
her
spoon
and
tankard
should
be
upon
the
march
,
without
have
receive
any
such
order
from
her
.
  
<EOS>
Our
poor
centinel
,
to
whom
the
sight
of
this
officer
be
not
much
more
welcome
than
the
apparition
,
as
he
think
it
,
which
he
have
see
before
,
again
relate
the
dreadful
story
,
and
with
many
addition
of
blood
and
fire
;
but
he
have
the
misfortune
to
gain
no
credit
with
either
of
the
last
-
mention
person
:
for
the
officer
,
though
a
very
religious
man
,
be
free
from
all
terror
of
this
kind
;
besides
,
have
so
lately
leave
Jones
in
the
condition
we
have
see
,
he
have
no
suspicion
of
his
be
dead
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
landlady
,
though
not
over
religious
,
she
have
no
kind
of
aversion
to
the
doctrine
of
spirit
;
but
there
be
a
circumstance
in
the
tale
which
she
well
know
to
be
false
,
as
we
shall
inform
the
reader
presently
.
  
<EOS>
but
whether
Northerton
be
carry
away
in
thunder
or
fire
,
or
in
whatever
other
manner
he
be
go
,
it
be
now
certain
that
his
body
be
no
longer
in
custody
.
<EOS>
upon
this
occasion
the
lieutenant
form
a
conclusion
not
very
different
from
what
the
serjeant
be
just
mention
to
have
make
before
,
and
immediately
order
the
centinel
to
be
take
prisoner
.
<EOS>
so
that
,
by
a
strange
reverse
of
fortune
(
though
not
very
uncommon
in
a
military
life
)
,
the
guard
become
the
guard
.
    
<EOS>
the
conclusion
of
the
foregoing
adventure
.
 
<EOS>
besides
the
suspicion
of
sleep
,
the
lieutenant
harbour
another
and
bad
doubt
against
the
poor
centinel
,
and
this
be
,
that
of
treachery
;
for
as
he
believe
not
one
syllable
of
the
apparition
,
so
he
imagine
the
whole
to
be
an
invention
form
only
to
impose
upon
him
,
and
that
the
fellow
have
in
reality
be
bribe
by
Northerton
to
let
him
escape
.
<EOS>
and
this
he
imagine
the
rather
,
as
the
fright
appear
to
him
the
more
unnatural
in
one
who
have
the
character
of
as
brave
and
bold
a
man
as
any
in
the
regiment
,
have
be
in
several
action
,
have
receive
several
wound
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
have
behave
himself
always
like
a
good
and
valiant
soldier
.
  
<EOS>
that
the
reader
,
therefore
,
may
not
conceive
the
least
ill
opinion
of
such
a
person
,
we
shall
not
delay
a
moment
in
rescue
his
character
from
the
imputation
of
this
guilt
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Northerton
then
,
as
we
have
before
observe
,
be
fully
satisfied
with
the
glory
which
he
have
obtain
from
this
action
.
<EOS>
He
have
perhaps
see
,
or
hear
,
or
guess
,
that
envy
be
apt
to
attend
fame
.
<EOS>
not
that
I
would
here
insinuate
that
he
be
heathenishly
inclined
to
believe
in
or
to
worship
the
goddess
Nemesis
;
for
,
in
fact
,
I
be
convince
he
never
hear
of
her
name
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
besides
,
of
an
active
disposition
,
and
have
a
great
antipathy
to
those
close
quarter
in
the
castle
of
Gloucester
,
for
which
a
justice
of
peace
may
possibly
give
him
a
billet
.
<EOS>
nor
be
he
moreover
free
from
some
uneasy
meditation
on
a
certain
wooden
edifice
,
which
I
forbear
to
name
,
in
conformity
to
the
opinion
of
mankind
,
who
,
I
think
,
rather
ought
to
honour
than
to
be
ashamed
of
this
building
,
as
it
be
,
or
at
least
may
be
make
,
of
more
benefit
to
society
than
almost
any
other
public
erection
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
to
hint
at
no
more
reason
for
his
conduct
,
Mr
Northerton
be
desirous
of
depart
that
evening
,
and
nothing
remain
for
him
but
to
contrive
the
quomodo
,
which
appear
to
be
a
matter
of
some
difficulty
.
  
<EOS>
now
this
young
gentleman
,
though
somewhat
crooked
in
his
moral
,
be
perfectly
straight
in
his
person
,
which
be
extremely
strong
and
well
make
.
<EOS>
His
face
too
be
account
handsome
by
the
generality
of
woman
,
for
it
be
broad
and
ruddy
,
with
tolerably
good
tooth
.
<EOS>
such
charm
do
not
fail
make
an
impression
on
my
landlady
,
who
have
no
little
relish
for
this
kind
of
beauty
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
indeed
,
a
real
compassion
for
the
young
man
;
and
hear
from
the
surgeon
that
affair
be
like
to
go
ill
with
the
volunteer
,
she
suspect
they
may
hereafter
wear
no
benign
aspect
with
the
ensign
.
<EOS>
have
obtain
,
therefore
,
leave
to
make
him
a
visit
,
and
find
him
in
a
very
melancholy
mood
,
which
she
considerably
heighten
by
tell
him
there
be
scarce
any
hope
of
the
volunteer
's
life
,
she
proceed
to
throw
forth
some
hint
,
which
the
other
readily
and
eagerly
take
up
,
they
soon
come
to
a
right
understanding
;
and
it
be
at
length
<EOS>
agree
that
the
ensign
should
,
at
a
certain
signal
,
ascend
the
chimney
,
which
communicate
very
soon
with
that
of
the
kitchen
<EOS>
,
he
may
there
again
let
himself
down
;
for
which
she
would
give
him
an
opportunity
by
keep
the
coast
clear
.
  
<EOS>
but
lest
our
reader
,
of
a
different
complexion
,
should
take
this
occasion
of
too
hastily
condemn
all
compassion
as
a
folly
,
and
pernicious
to
society
<EOS>
,
we
think
proper
to
mention
another
particular
which
may
possibly
have
some
little
share
in
this
action
.
<EOS>
the
ensign
happen
to
be
at
this
time
possess
of
the
sum
of
fifty
pound
,
which
do
indeed
belong
to
the
whole
company
;
for
the
captain
have
quarrel
with
his
lieutenant
,
have
entrust
the
payment
of
his
company
to
the
ensign
.
<EOS>
this
money
,
however
,
he
think
proper
to
deposit
in
my
landlady
's
hand
,
possibly
by
way
of
bail
or
security
that
he
would
hereafter
appear
and
answer
to
the
charge
against
him
;
but
whatever
be
the
condition
,
certain
it
be
,
that
she
have
the
money
and
the
ensign
his
liberty
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
may
perhaps
expect
,
from
the
compassionate
temper
of
this
good
woman
,
that
when
she
see
the
poor
centinel
take
prisoner
for
a
fact
of
which
she
know
him
innocent
,
she
should
immediately
have
interpose
in
his
behalf
;
but
whether
it
be
that
she
have
already
exhaust
all
her
compassion
in
the
above
-
mention
instance
,
or
that
the
feature
of
this
fellow
,
though
not
very
different
from
those
of
the
ensign
,
could
not
raise
it
,
I
will
not
determine
;
but
,
far
from
be
an
advocate
for
the
present
prisoner
,
she
urge
his
guilt
to
his
officer
,
declare
,
with
uplifted
eye
and
hand
,
that
she
would
not
have
have
any
concern
in
the
escape
of
a
murderer
for
all
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
everything
be
now
once
more
quiet
,
and
most
of
the
company
return
again
to
their
bed
;
but
the
landlady
,
either
from
the
natural
activity
of
her
disposition
,
or
from
her
fear
for
her
plate
,
have
no
propensity
to
sleep
,
prevail
with
the
officer
,
as
they
be
to
march
within
little
more
than
an
hour
,
to
spend
that
time
with
her
over
a
bowl
of
punch
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
have
lie
awake
all
this
while
,
and
have
hear
great
part
of
the
hurry
and
bustle
that
have
pass
,
of
which
he
have
now
some
curiosity
to
know
the
particular
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
apply
to
his
bell
,
which
he
ring
at
least
twenty
time
without
any
effect
:
for
my
landlady
be
in
such
high
mirth
with
her
company
,
that
no
clapper
could
be
hear
there
<EOS>
but
her
own
;
and
the
drawer
and
chambermaid
,
who
be
sit
together
in
the
kitchen
<EOS>
(
for
neither
durst
he
sit
up
nor
she
lie
in
bed
alone
)
,
<EOS>
the
more
they
hear
the
bell
re
the
more
they
be
frightened
,
and
as
it
be
nail
down
in
their
place
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
at
a
lucky
interval
of
chat
,
the
sound
reach
the
ear
of
our
good
landlady
,
who
presently
send
forth
her
summon
,
which
both
her
servant
instantly
obey
.
"
<EOS>
Joe
,
"
say
the
mistress
,
"
do
not
you
hear
the
gentleman
's
bell
ring
?
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
go
up
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
my
business
,
"
answer
the
drawer
,
"
to
wait
upon
the
chamber
 
it
be
Betty
Chambermaid
's
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
come
to
that
,
"
answer
the
maid
,
"
it
be
not
my
business
to
wait
upon
gentleman
.
<EOS>
I
have
do
it
indeed
sometimes
;
but
the
devil
fetch
me
if
ever
I
do
again
,
since
you
make
your
preamble
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
bell
still
ring
violently
,
their
mistress
fall
into
a
passion
,
and
swear
,
if
the
drawer
do
not
go
up
immediately
,
she
would
turn
him
away
that
very
morning
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
do
,
madam
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
can
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
do
another
servant
's
business
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
then
apply
herself
to
the
maid
,
and
endeavour
to
prevail
by
gentle
mean
;
but
all
in
vain
:
Betty
be
as
inflexible
as
Joe
.
<EOS>
both
insist
it
be
not
their
business
,
and
they
would
not
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
then
fall
a
laughing
,
and
say
,
"
come
,
I
will
put
an
end
to
this
contention
;
"
and
then
turn
to
the
servant
,
commend
them
for
their
resolution
in
not
give
up
the
point
;
but
add
,
he
be
sure
,
if
one
would
consent
to
go
the
other
would
.
<EOS>
to
which
proposal
they
both
agree
in
an
instant
,
and
accordingly
go
up
very
lovingly
and
close
together
.
<EOS>
when
they
be
go
,
the
lieutenant
appease
the
wrath
of
the
landlady
,
by
satisfy
her
why
they
be
both
so
unwilling
to
go
alone
.
  
<EOS>
They
return
soon
after
,
and
acquaint
their
mistress
,
that
the
sick
gentleman
be
so
far
from
be
dead
,
that
he
speak
as
heartily
as
if
he
be
well
;
and
that
he
give
his
service
to
the
captain
,
and
should
be
very
glad
of
the
favour
of
see
him
before
he
march
.
  
<EOS>
the
good
lieutenant
immediately
comply
with
his
desire
,
and
sit
down
by
his
bed
-
side
,
acquaint
him
with
the
scene
which
have
happen
below
,
conclude
with
his
intention
to
make
an
example
of
the
centinel
.
  
<EOS>
upon
this
Jones
relate
to
him
the
whole
truth
,
and
earnestly
beg
him
not
to
punish
the
poor
soldier
,
"
who
,
I
be
confident
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
as
innocent
of
the
ensign
's
escape
,
as
he
be
of
forge
any
lie
,
or
of
endeavour
to
impose
on
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
hesitate
a
few
moment
,
and
then
answer
:
"
why
,
as
you
have
clear
the
fellow
of
one
part
of
the
charge
,
so
it
will
be
impossible
to
prove
the
other
,
because
he
be
not
the
only
centinel
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
a
good
mind
to
punish
the
rascal
for
be
a
coward
.
<EOS>
yet
who
know
what
effect
the
terror
of
such
an
apprehension
may
have
?
<EOS>
and
,
to
say
the
truth
,
he
hath
always
behave
well
against
an
enemy
.
<EOS>
come
,
it
be
a
good
thing
to
see
any
sign
of
religion
in
these
fellow
;
so
I
promise
you
he
shall
be
set
at
liberty
when
we
march
.
<EOS>
but
hark
,
the
general
beat
.
<EOS>
My
dear
boy
,
give
me
another
buss
.
<EOS>
do
not
discompose
nor
hurry
yourself
;
but
remember
the
christian
doctrine
of
patience
,
and
I
warrant
you
will
soon
be
able
to
do
yourself
justice
,
and
to
take
an
honourable
revenge
on
the
fellow
who
hath
injure
you
.

<EOS>
the
lieutenant
then
depart
,
and
Jones
endeavour
to

book
VIII
.
  
<EOS>
contain
about
two
day
.
    
<EOS>
a
wonderful
long
chapter
concern
the
marvellous
;
be
much
the
long
of
all
our
introductory
chapter
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
be
now
enter
upon
a
book
in
which
the
course
of
our
history
will
oblige
us
to
relate
some
matter
of
a
more
strange
and
surprize
kind
than
any
which
have
hitherto
occur
,
it
may
not
be
amiss
,
in
the
prolegomenous
or
introductory
chapter
,
to
say
something
of
that
specie
of
writing
which
be
call
the
marvellous
.
<EOS>
to
this
we
shall
,
as
well
for
the
sake
of
ourselves
as
of
other
,
endeavour
to
set
some
certain
bound
,
and
indeed
nothing
can
be
more
necessary
,
as
critic
[
*
]
of
different
complexion
be
here
apt
to
run
into
very
different
extreme
;
for
while
some
be
,
with
M.
Dacier
,
ready
to
allow
,
that
the
same
thing
which
be
impossible
may
be
yet
probable
,
<EOS>
[
*
<EOS>
*
]
<EOS>
other
have
so
little
historic
or
poetic
faith
,
that
they
believe
nothing
to
be
either
possible
or
probable
,
the
like
to
which
hath
not
occur
to
their
own
observation
.
    
<EOS>
[
*
]
<EOS>
by
this
word
here
,
and
in
most
other
part
of
our
work
,
we
mean
  
every
reader
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
[
*
*
]
<EOS>
It
be
happy
for
M.
Dacier
that
he
be
not
an
Irishman
.
  
<EOS>
first
,
then
,
I
think
it
may
very
reasonably
be
require
of
every
writer
,
that
he
keep
within
the
bound
of
possibility
;
and
still
remember
that
what
it
be
not
possible
for
man
to
perform
,
it
be
scarce
possible
for
man
to
believe
he
do
perform
.
<EOS>
this
conviction
perhaps
give
birth
to
many
story
of
the
antient
heathen
deitie
(
for
most
of
them
be
of
poetical
original
)
.
<EOS>
the
poet
,
be
desirous
to
indulge
a
wanton
and
extravagant
imagination
,
take
refuge
in
that
power
,
of
the
extent
of
which
his
reader
be
no
judge
,
or
<EOS>
rather
which
they
imagine
to
be
infinite
,
and
consequently
they
could
not
be
shock
at
any
prodigy
relate
of
it
.
<EOS>
this
hath
be
strongly
urge
in
defence
of
Homer
's
miracle
;
and
it
be
perhaps
a
defence
;
not
,
as
Mr
Pope
would
have
it
,
because
Ulysses
tell
a
set
of
foolish
lie
to
the
Phaeacians
,
who
be
a
very
dull
nation
;
but
because
the
poet
himself
write
to
heathen
,
to
whom
poetical
fable
be
article
of
faith
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
must
confess
,
so
compassionate
be
my
temper
,
I
wish
Polypheme
have
confine
himself
to
his
milk
diet
,
and
preserve
his
eye
;
nor
could
ulysse
be
much
more
concerned
than
myself
,
when
his
companion
be
turn
into
swine
by
Circe
,
who
show
,
I
think
,
afterwards
,
too
much
regard
for
man
's
flesh
to
be
suppose
capable
of
convert
it
into
bacon
.
<EOS>
I
wish
,
likewise
,
with
all
my
heart
,
that
Homer
could
have
know
the
rule
prescribe
by
Horace
,
to
introduce
supernatural
agent
as
seldom
as
possible
.
<EOS>
We
should
not
then
have
see
his
god
come
on
trivial
errand
,
and
often
behave
themselves
so
as
not
only
to
forfeit
all
title
to
respect
,
but
to
become
the
object
of
scorn
and
derision
.
<EOS>
a
conduct
which
must
have
shock
the
credulity
of
a
pious
and
sagacious
heathen
;
and
which
could
never
have
be
defend
,
unless
by
agree
with
a
supposition
to
which
I
have
be
sometimes
almost
inclined
,
that
this
most
glorious
poet
,
as
he
certainly
be
,
have
an
intent
to
burlesque
the
superstitious
faith
of
his
own
age
and
country
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
have
rest
too
long
on
a
doctrine
which
can
be
of
no
use
to
a
christian
writer
;
for
as
he
can
not
introduce
into
his
work
any
of
that
heavenly
host
which
make
a
part
of
his
creed
,
so
it
be
horrid
puerility
to
search
the
heathen
theology
for
any
of
those
deity
who
have
be
long
since
dethrone
from
their
immortality
.
<EOS>
Lord
Shaftesbury
observe
,
that
nothing
be
more
cold
than
the
invocation
of
a
muse
by
a
modern
;
he
may
have
add
,
that
nothing
can
be
more
absurd
.
<EOS>
a
modern
may
with
much
more
elegance
invoke
a
ballad
,
as
some
have
think
Homer
do
,
or
a
mug
of
ale
,
with
the
author
of
Hudibras
;
which
latter
may
perhaps
have
inspire
much
more
poetry
,
as
well
as
prose
,
than
all
the
liquor
of
Hippocrene
or
Helicon
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
supernatural
agent
which
can
in
any
manner
be
allow
to
us
modern
,
be
ghost
;
but
of
these
I
would
advise
an
author
to
be
extremely
spare
.
<EOS>
these
be
indeed
,
like
arsenic
,
and
other
dangerous
drug
in
physic
,
to
be
use
with
the
utmost
caution
;
nor
would
I
advise
the
introduction
of
them
at
all
in
those
work
,
or
by
those
author
,
to
which
,
or
to
whom
,
a
horse
-
laugh
in
the
reader
would
be
any
great
prejudice
or
mortification
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
elf
and
fairy
,
and
other
such
mummery
,
I
purposely
omit
the
mention
of
them
,
as
I
should
be
very
unwilling
to
confine
within
any
bound
those
surprizing
imagination
,
for
whose
vast
capacity
the
limit
of
human
nature
be
too
narrow
;
whose
work
be
to
be
consider
as
a
new
creation
;
and
who
have
consequently
just
right
to
do
what
they
will
with
their
own
.
  
<EOS>
Man
therefore
be
the
high
subject
(
unless
on
very
extraordinary
occasion
indeed
)
which
present
itself
to
the
pen
of
our
historian
,
or
of
our
poet
;
and
,
in
relate
his
action
,
great
care
be
to
be
take
that
we
do
not
exceed
the
capacity
of
the
agent
we
describe
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
possibility
alone
sufficient
to
justify
us
;
we
must
keep
likewise
within
the
rule
of
probability
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
I
think
,
the
opinion
of
Aristotle
;
or
if
not
,
it
be
the
opinion
of
some
wise
man
,
whose
authority
will
be
as
weighty
when
it
be
as
old
,
"
that
it
be
no
excuse
for
a
poet
who
relate
what
be
incredible
,
that
the
thing
relate
be
really
matter
of
fact
.
<EOS>
"
this
may
perhaps
be
allow
true
with
regard
to
poetry
,
but
it
may
be
think
impracticable
to
extend
it
to
the
historian
;
for
he
be
oblige
to
record
matter
as
he
find
them
,
though
they
may
be
of
so
extraordinary
a
nature
as
will
require
no
small
degree
of
historical
faith
to
swallow
them
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
successless
armament
of
Xerxes
describe
by
Herodotus
,
or
the
successful
expedition
of
Alexander
relate
by
Arrian
.
<EOS>
such
of
later
year
be
the
victory
of
Agincourt
obtain
by
Harry
the
Fifth
,
or
that
of
Narva
win
by
Charles
the
Twelfth
of
Sweden
.
<EOS>
all
which
instance
,
the
more
we
reflect
on
them
,
appear
still
the
more
astonishing
.
  
<EOS>
such
fact
,
however
,
as
they
occur
in
the
thread
of
the
story
,
nay
,
indeed
,
as
they
constitute
the
essential
part
of
it
,
the
historian
be
not
only
justifiable
in
recording
as
they
really
happen
,
but
indeed
would
be
unpardonable
<EOS>
should
he
omit
or
alter
them
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
other
fact
not
of
such
consequence
nor
so
necessary
,
which
,
though
ever
so
well
attested
,
may
nevertheless
be
sacrifice
to
oblivion
in
complacence
to
the
scepticism
of
a
reader
.
<EOS>
such
be
that
memorable
story
of
the
ghost
of
George
Villiers
,
which
may
with
more
propriety
have
be
make
a
present
of
to
Dr
Drelincourt
,
to
have
keep
the
ghost
of
Mrs
Veale
company
,
at
the
head
of
his
discourse
upon
death
,
than
have
be
introduce
into
so
solemn
a
work
as
the
history
of
the
rebellion
.
  
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
if
the
historian
will
confine
himself
to
what
really
happen
,
and
utterly
reject
any
circumstance
,
which
,
though
never
so
well
attested
,
he
must
be
well
assured
be
false
,
he
will
sometimes
fall
into
the
marvellous
,
but
never
into
the
incredible
.
<EOS>
He
will
often
raise
the
wonder
and
surprize
of
his
reader
,
but
never
that
incredulous
hatred
mention
by
Horace
.
<EOS>
It
be
by
fall
into
fiction
,
therefore
,
that
we
generally
offend
against
this
rule
,
of
desert
probability
,
which
the
historian
seldom
,
if
ever
,
quit
,
till
he
forsake
his
character
and
commence
a
writer
of
romance
.
<EOS>
in
this
,
however
,
those
historian
who
relate
public
transaction
,
have
the
advantage
of
us
who
confine
ourselves
to
scene
of
private
life
.
<EOS>
the
credit
of
the
former
be
by
common
notoriety
support
for
a
long
time
;
and
public
record
,
with
the
concurrent
testimony
of
many
author
,
bear
evidence
to
their
truth
in
future
age
.
<EOS>
thus
a
Trajan
and
an
Antoninus
,
a
Nero
and
a
Caligula
,
have
all
meet
with
the
belief
of
posterity
;
and
no
one
doubt
but
that
man
so
very
good
,
and
so
very
bad
,
be
once
the
master
of
mankind
.
  
<EOS>
but
we
who
deal
in
private
character
,
who
search
into
the
most
retired
recess
,
and
draw
forth
example
of
virtue
and
vice
from
hole
and
corner
of
the
world
,
be
in
a
more
dangerous
situation
.
<EOS>
as
we
have
no
public
notoriety
,
no
concurrent
testimony
,
no
record
to
support
and
corroborate
what
we
deliver
,
it
become
us
to
keep
within
the
limit
not
only
of
possibility
,
but
of
probability
too
;
and
this
more
especially
in
paint
what
be
greatly
good
and
amiable
.
<EOS>
Knavery
and
folly
,
though
never
so
exorbitant
,
will
more
easily
meet
with
assent
;
for
ill
-
nature
add
great
support
and
strength
to
faith
.
  
<EOS>
thus
we
may
,
perhaps
,
with
little
danger
,
relate
the
history
of
Fisher
;
who
have
long
owe
his
bread
to
the
generosity
of
Mr
Derby
,
and
have
one
morning
receive
a
considerable
bounty
from
his
hand
,
yet
,
in
order
to
possess
himself
of
what
remain
in
his
friend
's
scrutore
,
conceal
himself
in
a
public
office
of
the
Temple
,
through
which
there
be
a
passage
into
Mr
Derby
's
chamber
.
<EOS>
here
he
overhear
Mr
Derby
for
many
hour
solace
himself
at
an
entertainment
which
he
that
evening
give
his
friend
,
and
to
which
Fisher
have
be
invite
.
<EOS>
during
all
this
time
,
no
tender
,
no
grateful
reflection
arise
to
restrain
his
purpose
;
but
when
the
poor
gentleman
have
let
his
company
out
through
the
office
,
Fisher
come
suddenly
from
his
lurking
-
place
,
and
walk
softly
behind
his
friend
into
his
chamber
,
discharge
a
pistol
-
ball
into
his
head
.
<EOS>
this
may
be
believe
when
the
bone
of
Fisher
be
as
rotten
as
his
heart
.
<EOS>
nay
,
perhaps
,
it
will
be
credit
,
that
the
villain
go
two
day
afterwards
with
some
young
lady
to
the
play
of
Hamlet
;
and
with
an
unaltered
countenance
hear
one
of
the
lady
,
who
little
suspect
how
near
she
be
to
the
person
,
cry
out
,
"
good
God
!
<EOS>
if
the
man
that
murder
Mr
Derby
be
now
present
!
"
<EOS>
manifest
in
this
a
more
seared
and
callous
conscience
than
even
Nero
himself
;
of
whom
we
be
tell
by
Suetonius
,
"
that
the
consciousness
of
his
guilt
,
after
the
death
of
his
mother
,
become
immediately
intolerable
,
and
so
continued
;
nor
could
all
the
congratulation
of
the
soldier
,
of
the
senate
,
and
the
people
,
allay
the
horror
of
his
conscience
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
now
,
on
the
other
hand
,
should
I
tell
my
reader
,
that
I
have
know
a
man
whose
penetrate
genius
have
enable
him
to
raise
a
large
fortune
in
a
way
where
no
beginning
be
chaulke
out
to
him
;
that
he
have
do
this
with
the
most
perfect
preservation
of
his
integrity
,
and
not
only
without
the
least
injustice
or
injury
to
any
one
individual
person
,
but
with
the
high
advantage
to
trade
,
and
a
vast
increase
of
the
public
revenue
;
that
he
have
expend
one
part
of
the
income
of
this
fortune

discover
a
taste
superior
to
most

by
work
where
the
high
dignity
be
unite
with
the
pure
simplicity
,
and
another
part
in
display
a
degree
of

superior
to
all
man
,
by
act
of
charity
to
object
<EOS>
whose
only
recommendation
be
their
merit
,
or
their
want
;
that
he
be
most
industrious
in
search
after
merit
in
distress
,
most
eager
to
relieve
it
,
and
then
as
careful
(
perhaps
too
careful
)
to
conceal
what
he
have
do
;
that
his
house
,
his
furniture
,
his
garden
,
his
table
,
his
private
hospitality
,
and
his
public
beneficence
,
all
denote
the
mind
from
which
they
flow
,
and
be
all
intrinsically
rich
and
noble
,
without
tinsel
,
or
external
ostentation
;
that
he
fill
every
relation
in
life
with
the
most
adequate
virtue
;
that
he
be
most
piously
religious
to
his
Creator
,
most
zealously
loyal
to
his
sovereign
;
a
most
tender
husband
to
his
wife
,
a
kind
relation
,
a
munificent
patron
,
a
warm
and
firm
friend

a
knowing
and
a
chearful
companion

indulgent
to
his

hospitable
to
his

charitable
to

benevolent
to

<EOS>
Should
I
add
to
these
the
epithet
of
wise
,
brave
,
elegant
,
and
indeed
every
other
amiable
epithet
in
our
language
,
I
may
surely
say
,
    
Quis
credet
?
<EOS>
nemo
Hercule
!
<EOS>
nemo
;
      
Vel
duo
,
vel
nemo
;
  
and
<EOS>
yet
I
know
a
man
who
be
all
I
have
here
describe
.
<EOS>
but
a
single
instance
(
and
I
really
know
not
such
another
)
be
not
sufficient
to
justify
us
,
while
we
be
write
to
thousand
who
never
hear
of
the
person
,
nor
of
anything
like
him
.
<EOS>
such
rarae
ave
should
be
remit
to
the
epitaph
writer
,
or
to
some
poet
who
may
condescend
to
hitch
him
in
a
distich
,
or
to
slide
him
into
a
rhime
with
an
air
of
carelessness
and
neglect
,
without
give
any
offence
to
the
reader
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
last
place
,
the
action
should
be
such
as
may
not
only
be
within
the
compass
of
human
agency
,
and
which
human
agent
may
probably
be
suppose
to
do
;
but
they
should
be
likely
for
the
very
actor
and
character
themselves
to
have
perform
;
for
what
may
be
only
wonderful
and
surprizing
in
one
man
,
may
become
improbable
,
or
indeed
impossible
,
when
relate
of
another
.
  
<EOS>
this
last
requisite
be
what
the
dramatic
critic
call
conversation
of
character
;
and
it
require
a
very
extraordinary
degree
of
judgment
,
and
a
most
exact
knowledge
of
human
nature
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
admirably
remark
by
a
most
excellent
writer
,
that
zeal
can
no
more
hurry
a
man
to
act
in
direct
opposition
to
itself
,
than
a
rapid
stream
can
carry
a
boat
against
its
own
current
.
<EOS>
I
will
venture
to
say
,
that
for
a
man
to
act
in
direct
contradiction
to
the
dictate
of
his
nature
,
be
,
if
not
impossible
,
as
improbable
and
as
miraculous
as
anything
which
can
well
be
conceive
.
<EOS>
Should
the
good
part
of
the
story
of
M.
Antoninus
be
ascribe
to
Nero
,
or
should
the
bad
incident
of
Nero
's
life
be
impute
to
Antoninus
<EOS>
,
what
would
be
more
shocking
to
belief
than
either
instance
?
<EOS>
whereas
both
these
be
relate
of
their
proper
agent
,
constitute
the
truly
marvellous
.
  
<EOS>
Our
modern
author
of
comedy
have
fall
almost
universally
into
the
error
here
hint
at
;
their
hero
generally
be
notorious
rogue
,
and
their
heroine
abandon
jade
,
during
the
first
four
act
;
but
in
the
fifth
,
the
former
become
very
worthy
gentleman
,
and
the
latter
woman
of
virtue
and
discretion
:
nor
be
the
writer
often
so
kind
as
to
give
himself
the
least
trouble
to
reconcile
or
account
for
this
monstrous
change
and
incongruity
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
indeed
,
no
other
reason
to
be
assign
for
it
,
than
because
the
play
be
draw
to
a
conclusion
;
as
if
it
be
no
less
natural
in
a
rogue
to
repent
in
the
last
act
of
a
play
,
than
in
the
last
of
his
life
;
which
we
perceive
to
be
generally
the
case
at
Tyburn
,
a
place
which
may
indeed
close
the
scene
of
some
comedy
with
much
propriety
,
as
the
hero
in
these
be
most
commonly
eminent
for
those
very
talent
which
not
only
bring
man
to
the
gallow
,
but
enable
them
to
make
an
heroic
figure
when
they
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
within
these
few
restriction
,
I
think
,
every
writer
may
be
permit
to
deal
as
much
in
the
wonderful
as
he
please
;
nay
,
if
he
thus
keep
within
the
rule
of
credibility
,
the
more
he
can
surprize
the
reader
the
more
he
will
engage
his
attention
,
and
the
more
he
will
charm
him
.
<EOS>
as
a
genius
of
the
high
rank
observe
in
his
fifth
chapter
of
the
Bathos
,
"
the
great
art
of
all
poetry
be
to
mix
truth
with
fiction
,
in
order
to
join
the
credible
with
the
surprizing
.
"
  
<EOS>
for
though
every
good
author
will
confine
himself
within
the
bound
of
probability
,
it
be
by
no
mean
necessary
that
his
character
,
or
his
incident
,
should
be
trite
,
common
,
or
vulgar
;
such
as
happen
in
every
street
,
or
in
every
house
,
or
which
may
be
meet
with
in
the
home
article
of
a
newspaper
.
<EOS>
nor
must
he
be
inhibit
from
show
many
person
and
thing
,
which
may
possibly
have
never
fall
within
the
knowledge
of
great
part
of
his
reader
.
<EOS>
if
the
writer
strictly
observe
the
rule
<EOS>
above
-
mention
,
he
hath
discharge
his
part
;
and
be
then
intitle
to
some
faith
from
his
reader
,
who
be
indeed
guilty
of
critical
infidelity
if
he
disbelieve
him
.
  
<EOS>
for
want
of
a
portion
of
such
faith
,
I
remember
the
character
of
a
young
lady
of
quality
,
which
be
condemn
on
the
stage
for
be
unnatural
,
by
the
unanimous
voice
of
a
very
large
assembly
of
clerk
and
apprentice
;
though
it
have
the
previous
suffrage
of
many
lady
of
the
first
rank
;
one
of
whom
,
very
eminent
for
her
understanding
,
declare
it
be
the
picture
of
half
the
young
people
of
her
acquaintance
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
the
landlady
pay
a
visit
to
Mr
Jones
.
 
<EOS>
when
Jones
have
take
leave
of
his
friend
the
lieutenant
,
he
endeavour
to
close
his
eye
,
but
all
in
vain
;
his
spirit
be
too
lively
and
wakeful
to
be
lull
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
so
have
amuse
,
or
rather
tormented
,
himself
with
the
thought
of
his
Sophia
till
it
be
open
daylight
,
he
call
for
some
tea
;
upon
which
occasion
my
landlady
herself
vouchsafe
to
pay
him
a
visit
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
indeed
the
first
time
she
have
see
him
,
or
at
least
have
take
any
notice
of
him
;
but
as
the
lieutenant
have
assure
her
that
he
be
certainly
some
young
gentleman
of
fashion
,
she
now
determine
to
show
him
all
the
respect
in
her
power
;
for
,
to
speak
truly
,
this
be
one
of
those
house
where
gentleman
,
to
use
the
language
of
advertisement
,
meet
with
civil
treatment
for
their
money
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
no
sooner
begin
to
make
his
tea
,
than
she
likewise
begin
to
discourse
:
 
<EOS>
"
La
!
sir
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
think
it
be
great
pity
<EOS>
that
such
a
pretty
young
gentleman
should
under
-
value
himself
<EOS>
so
,
as
to
go
about
with
these
soldier
fellow
.
<EOS>
They
call
themselves
gentleman
,
I
warrant
you
;
but
,
as
my
first
husband
use
to
say
,
they
should
remember
it
be
we
that
pay
them
.
<EOS>
and
to
be
sure
it
be
very
hard
upon
us
to
be
oblige
to
pay
them
,
and
to
keep
"
um
too
,
as
we
publican
be
.
<EOS>
I
have
twenty
of
"
um
last
night
,
besides
officer
:
<EOS>
nay
,
for
matter
o
'
that
,
I
have
rather
have
the
soldier
than
officer
:
for
nothing
be
ever
good
enough
for
those
spark
;
and
I
be
sure
,
if
you
be
to
see
the
bill
;
la
!
<EOS>
sir
,
it
be
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
less
trouble
,
I
warrant
you
,
with
a
good
squire
's
family
,
where
we
take
forty
or
fifty
shilling
of
a
night
,
besides
horse
.
<EOS>
and
yet
I
warrant
me
<EOS>
,
there
be
narrow
a
one
of
those
officer
fellow
but
look
upon
himself
to
be
as
good
as
arrow
a
squire
of
L500
a
year
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
it
doth
me
good
to
hear
their
man
run
about
after
"
um
,
cry
your
honour
,
and
your
honour
.
<EOS>
marry
come
up
with
such
honour
,
and
an
ordinary
at
a
shill
a
head
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
such
swearing
among
"
um
,
to
be
sure
it
frighten
me
out
o
'
<EOS>
my
wit
<EOS>
:
I
think
nothing
can
ever
prosper
with
such
wicked
people
.
<EOS>
and
here
one
of
"
um
have
use
you
in
so
barbarous
a
manner
.
<EOS>
I
think
indeed
how
well
the
rest
would
secure
him
;
they
all
hang
together
;
for
if
you
have
be
in
danger
of
death
,
which
I
be
glad
to
see
you
be
not
,
it
would
have
be
all
as
one
to
such
wicked
people
.
<EOS>
They
would
have
let
the
murderer
go
.
<EOS>
Laud
have
mercy
upon
"
um
;
I
would
not
have
such
a
sin
to
answer
for
,
for
the
whole
world
.
<EOS>
but
though
you
be
likely
,
with
the
blessing
,
to
recover
,
there
be
laa
for
him
yet
;
and
if
you
will
employ
lawyer
Small
,
I
darest
be
swear
<EOS>
he
will
make
the
fellow
fly
the
country
for
him
;
though
perhaps
he
will
have
flee
the
country
before
;
for
it
be
here
to
-
day
and
go
to
-
morrow
with
such
chap
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
however
,
you
will
learn
more
wit
for
the
future
,
and
return
back
to
your
friend
;
I
warrant
they
be
all
miserable
for
your
loss
;
and
if
they
be
but
to
know
what
have
happen
 
La
,
<EOS>
my
seeming
!
<EOS>
I
would
not
for
the
world
they
should
.
<EOS>
come
,
come
<EOS>
,
we
know
very
well
what
all
the
matter
be
;
but
if
one
will
not
,
another
will
;
so
pretty
a
gentleman
nee
never
want
a
lady
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
if
I
be
you
,
I
would
see
the
fine
she
that
ever
wear
a
head
hang
,
before
I
would
go
for
a
soldier
for
her

Nay

do
not
blush
so

(
for
indeed

do
to

violent
degree

why

yes

I

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
fame
of
his
goodness
indeed
,
"
answer
Jones
,
"
must
have
extend
farther
than
this

but
heaven
only
can
know
him
 
can
know
that
benevolence
which
it
copy
from
itself
,
and
send
upon
earth
as
its
own
pattern

<EOS>
mankind
be
as
ignorant
of
such
divine
goodness
,
as
they
be
unworthy
of
it
;

none
so
unworthy
of

myself

I

who
be

by
him

in

as
you

well

a
poor

bear

adopt

as

dare
by
my
folly
to
disoblige
him

to
draw
his
vengeance
upon

<EOS>
yes

I
deserve
it
all

for
I
will
never
be
so
ungrateful
as
ever
to
think
he
hath

act

<EOS>
no

I

I

now

madam

he
,

I
believe
you
will
not
blame
me
for
turn

very
little

My

she
fling

for
the
low
sort
of
people
be
very
tenacious
of
respect

though
they
be
content
to
give
this
gratis

person
of
quality

yet
they
never

<EOS>
in

make
his
second
appearance

<EOS>
before
we
proceed
any
farther
,
that
the
reader
may
not
be
mistake
in
imagine
the
landlady
know
more
than
she

surprize
that
she

much

it

that

the
rest

her
knowledge

the
sagacious
reader
will
observe
how
she
come
by
it
in
the
precede
scene

<EOS>
great
curiosity
be
indeed
mix
with
her
virtue

she
never

suffer
any

to
depart
from
her
house

without
enquire
as
much
as
possible
into
their

<EOS>
She
be
no
sooner
go
than
Jones
,
instead
of
animadvert
on
her
behaviour
,
reflect
that
he
be
in
the
same
bed
which
he
be
inform
have
hold
his
dear
Sophia
.
<EOS>
this
occasion
a
thousand
fond
and
tender
thought
,
which
we
would
dwell
longer
upon
,
do
we
not
consider
that
such
kind
of
lover
will
make

very
inconsiderable
part
of

<EOS>
in
this
situation
the
surgeon
find
him
,
when
he
come
to
dress
his
wound
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
perceive
,
upon
examination
,
that
his
pulse
be
disorder
,
and
hear
that
he
have
not
sleep
,
declare
that
he
be
in
great
danger
;
for
he
apprehend
a
fever
be
come
on
,
which
he
would
have
prevent
by
bleed
,
but
Jones
would
not
submit
,
declare
he
would
lose
no
more
blood
;
"
and
,
doctor
,
"
say
he
,
"
if
you
will
be
so
kind
only
to
dress
my
head

I
have
no
doubt
of
be
well
in

day

two

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I

,

answer
the
surgeon
,
"
I
could
assure
your
be
well
in

two

<EOS>
well
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
people
be
not
so
soon
well
of
such
contusion
;
but
,
sir
,
I
be
not
at
this
time
of
day
to
be
instruct
in
my
operation
by
a
patient
,
and
I
insist
on
make
a
revulsion
before
I
dress
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
persist
obstinately
in
his
refusal
,
and
the
doctor
at
last
yield
;
tell
him
at
the
same
time
that
he
would
not
be
answerable
for
the
ill
consequence
,
and
hope
he
would
do
him
the
justice
to
acknowledge
that
he
have
give
him
a
contrary
advice
;
which
the
patient
promise
he
would
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
retire
into
the
kitchen
,
where
,
address
himself
to
the
landlady
,
he
complain
bitterly
of
the
undutiful
behaviour
of
his
patient
,
who
would
not
be
blooded
,
though
he
be
in
a
fever
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
an
eat
fever
then
,
"
say
the
landlady
;
"
for
he
hath
devour
two
swinging
buttered
toast
this
morning
for
breakfast
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
likely
,
"
say
the
doctor
:
"
I
have
know
people
eat
in
a
fever
;
and
it
be
very
easily
account
for
;
because
the
acidity
occasion
by
the
febrile
matter
may
stimulate
the
nerve
of
the
diaphragm
,
and
thereby
occasion
a
craving
which
will
not
be
easily
distinguishable
from
a
natural
appetite
;
but
the
aliment
will
not
be
concrete
,
nor
assimilate
into
chyle
,
and
so
will
corrode
the
vascular
orifice
,
and
thus
will
aggravate
the
febrific
symptom
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
think
the
gentleman
in
a
very
dangerous
way
,
and
,
if
he
be
not
blooded
,
I
be
afraid
will
die
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
every
man
must
die
some
time
or
other
,
"
answer
the
good
woman
;
"
it
be
no
business
of
mine
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
doctor
,
you
would
not
have
me
hold
him
while
you
bleed
him
.
<EOS>
but
,
hark'ee
,
a
word
in
your
ear
;
I
would
advise
you
,
before
you
proceed
too
far
,
to
take
care
who
be
to
be
your
paymaster
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Paymaster
!
"
say
the
doctor
,
stare
;
"
why
,
I
have
a
gentleman
under
my
hand
,
have
I
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
imagine
so
as
well
as
you
,
"
say
the
landlady
;
"
<EOS>
but
,
as
my
first
husband
use
to
say
,
everything
be
not
what
it
look
to
be
.
<EOS>
He
be
an
arrant
scrub
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
however
,
take
no
notice
that
I
mention
anything
to
you
of
the
matter
;
but
I
think
people
in
business
oft
always
to
let
one
another
know
such
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
have
I
suffer
such
a
fellow
as
this
,
"
cry
the
doctor
,
in
a
passion
,
"
to
instruct
me
?
<EOS>
Shall
I
hear
my
practice
insult
by
one
who
will
not
pay
me
?
<EOS>
I
be
glad
I
have
make
this
discovery
in
time
.
<EOS>
I
will
see
now
whether
he
will
be
blooded
or
no
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
immediately
go
upstairs
,
and
fling
open
the
door
of
the
chamber
with
much
violence
,
awake
poor
Jones
from
a
very
sound
nap

into
which
he
be
fall

and
,
what
be
still
bad

from
a
delicious
dream
concern
Sophia

<EOS>
"
Will
you
be
blooded

"
cry
the
doctor
,
in
a
rage

<EOS>
"
I
have
tell
you
my
resolution
already

answer
Jones
,
"
and
I
wish
with
all
my
heart
you
have
take
my

many
a

sleep

not

no
more

remember

I
demand
of
you

<EOS>
"
I

you
for

Jones
,
"
I
will
not

"
then
I
wash
my
hand
of
you

Jones

you
do
not

indeed

very

<EOS>
what
a

such
vagabond

"
<EOS>
at
which
word
he
fling
out
of
the
room
,
and
his
patient
turn
himself
about
soon
recover
his
sleep
;
but
his
dream
be
unfortunately
go
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
be
introduce
one
of
the
pleasantest
barber
that
be
ever
record
in
history
,
the
barber
of
Bagdad
,
or
he
in
Don
Quixote
,
not
except
.
 
<EOS>
the
clock
have
now
strike
five
when
Jones
awake
from
a
nap
of
seven
hour
,
so
much
refresh
,
and
in
such
perfect
health
and
spirit
,
that
he
resolve
to
get
up
and
dress
himself
;
for
which
purpose
he
unlock
his
portmanteau
,
and
take
out
clean
linen
,
and
a
suit
of
cloath
;
but
first
he
slipt
on
a
frock
,
and
go
down
into
the
kitchen
to
bespeak
something
that
may
pacify
certain
tumult
he
find
rise
within
his
stomach
.
  
<EOS>
meet
the
landlady
,
he
accost
her
with
great
civility
,
and
ask
,
"
what
he
could
have
for
dinner
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
for
dinner
!
<EOS>
"
say
she
;
"
it
be
an
odd
time
a
day
to
think
about
dinner
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
dr
in
the
house
,
and
the
fire
be
almost
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
but
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
must
have
something
to
eat
,
and
it
be
almost
indifferent
to
me
<EOS>
what
;
for
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
be
never
more
hungry
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
believe
there
be
a
piece
of
cold
buttock
and
carrot
,
which
will
fit
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
nothing
better
,
"
answer
Jones
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
should
be
oblige
to
you
,
if
you
would
let
it
be
fry
.
"
<EOS>
to
which
the
landlady
consent
,
and
say
,
smile
,
"
she
be
glad
to
see
him
so
well
recovered
;
"
for
the
sweetness
of
our
heroe
's
temper
be
almost
irresistible
;
besides
,
she
be
really
no
ill
-
humoured
woman
at
the
bottom
;
but
she
love
money
so
much
,
that
she
hate
everything
which
have
the
semblance
of
poverty
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
now
return
in
order
to
dress
himself
,
while
his
dinner
be
prepare
,
and
be
,
accord
to
his
order
,
attend
by
the
barber
.
  
<EOS>
this
barber
,
who
go
by
the
name
of
Little
Benjamin
,
be
a
fellow
of
great
oddity
and
humour
,
which
have
frequently
let
him
into
small
inconveniencie
,
such
as
slap
in
the
face
,
kick
in
the
breech
,
broken
bone
,
&
c.
<EOS>
for
every
one
doth
not
understand
a
jest
;
and
those
who
do
be
often
displeased
with
be
themselves
the
subject
of
it
.
<EOS>
this
vice
be
,
however
,
incurable
in
him
;
and
though
he
have
often
smart
for
it
,
yet
if
ever
he
conceive
a
joke
,
he
be
certain
to
be
deliver
of
it
,
without
the
least
respect
of
person
,
time
,
or
place
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
a
great
many
other
particularity
in
his
character
,
which
I
shall
not
mention
,
as
the
reader
will
himself
very
easily
perceive
them
,
on
his
farth
acquaintance
with
this
extraordinary
person
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
be
impatient
to
be
dr
,
for
a
reason
which
may
be
easily
imagine
,
think
the
shaver
be
very
tedious
in
prepare
his
sud
,
and
beg
him
to
make
haste
;
to
which
the
other
answer
with
much
gravity
,
for
he
never
discompose
his
muscle
on
any
account
,
"
Festina
lente
,
be
a
proverb
which
I
learn
long
before
I
ever

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
find
,
friend

you
be
a
scholar

reply
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
poor
one
,
"
say
the
barber
,
"
non
omnia
possumus
omnes

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
again
!
"
say
Jones
;
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
you
be
good
at
capping
verse
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
excuse
me
,
sir
,
"
say
the
barber
,
"
non
tanto
me
dignor
honore

"
<EOS>
and
then
proceed
to
his
operation
,
"
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
since
I
have
deal
in
suds
,
I
could
never
discover
more
than
two
reason
for
shaving
;
the
one
be
to
get
a
beard
,
and
the
other
to
get
rid
of
one
.
<EOS>
I
conjecture
,
<EOS>
sir
,
it
may
not
be
long
since
you
shave
from
the
former
of
these
motive
.
<EOS>
upon
my
word
,
you
have
have
good
success
;
for
one
may
say
of
your
beard
,
that
it
be
tondenti
gravior
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
conjecture
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
that
thou
art
a
very
comical
fellow

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
mistake
me
widely
,
sir

"
say
the
barber
:
"
I
be
too
much
addict
to
the
study
of
philosophy

hinc
illae
lacrymae

my
misfortune

<EOS>
too
much

be
my
ruin

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
I
confess
,
friend
,
you
have
more
learning
than
generally
belong
to
your
trade

I
can
not

how
it
can
have
injure
you

my

disinherit
me
for

<EOS>
He
be
a

master

and
because
I
could
read
before
I
could

he
take
an
aversion

leave
every

Will
you

<EOS>
I
ask
your
pardon

I
fancy
there
be
hiatus
in
manuscriptis

<EOS>
I
hear
you
be
go
to
the
war

I
find
it
be
a
mistake

"
 
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
conclude
so
?
"
say
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
sure
,
sir

"
answer
the
barber
,
"
you
be
too
wise
a
man
to
carry
a
broken

thither

for
that

be
carry
coal
to
Newcastle

"
  
<EOS>
"
upon

cry
Jones
,
"
thou
art
a

shall
be
very

"
  
"
<EOS>
O
dear

say
the

"
I
can
do
you
twenty
time

great

will
accept
of

what
be

my

<EOS>
cry
Jones

<EOS>
"
why
,
I
will
drink
a
bottle
with
you

for
I
dearly
love
good

nature

as
you
have
find
me
out
to
be

comical

so
I
have
no

"
<EOS>
Jones
now
walk
downstairs
neatly
dr
,
and
perhaps
the
fair
Adonis
be
not
a
lovelier
figure
;
and
yet
he
have
no
charm
for
my
landlady
;
for
as
that
good
woman
do
not
resemble
Venus
at
all
in
her
person
,
so
neither
do
she
in
her
taste
.
<EOS>
Happy
have
it
be
for
Nanny
<EOS>
the
chambermaid
,
if
she
have
see
with
the
eye
of
her
mistress
,
for
that
poor
girl
fall
so
violently
in
love
with
Jones
in
five
minute
,
that
her
passion
afterwards
cost
her
many
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
this
Nanny
be
extremely
pretty
,
and
altogether
as
coy
;
for
she
have
refuse
a
drawer
,
and
one
or
two
young
farmer
in
the
neighbourhood
,
but
the
bright
eye
of
our
heroe
thaw
all
her
ice
in
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
when
Jones
return
to
the
kitchen
,
his
cloth
be
not
yet
lay
;
nor
indeed
be
there
any
occasion
it
should
,
his
dinner
remain
in
statu
quo
,
as
do
the
fire
which
be
to
dress
it
.
<EOS>
this
disappointment
may
have
put
many
a
philosophical
temper
into
a
passion
;
but
it
have
no
such
effect
on
Jones
.
<EOS>
He
only
give
the
landlady
a
gentle
rebuke
,
say
,
"
since
it
be
so
difficult
to
get
it
heated
he
would
eat
the
beef
cold
.
"
<EOS>
but
now
the
good
woman
,
whether
move
by
compassion
,
or
by
shame
,
or
by
whatever
other
motive
,
I
can
not
tell
,
first
give
her
servant
a
round
scold
for
disobey
the
order
which
she
have
never
give
,
and
then
bid
the
drawer
lie
a
napkin
in
the
Sun
<EOS>
,
she
set
about
the
matter
in
good
earnest
,
and
soon
accomplish
it
.
  
<EOS>
this
Sun
,
into
which
Jones
be
now
conduct
,
be
truly
name
,
as
lucus
a
non
lucendo
;
for
it
be
an
apartment
into
which
the
sun
have
scarce
ever
look
.
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
the
bad
room
in
the
house
;
and
happy
be
it
for
Jones
that
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
be
now
too
hungry
to
find
any
fault
;
but
have
once
satisfy
his
appetite
,
he
order
the
drawer
to
carry
a
bottle
of
wine
into
a
well
room
,
and
express
some
resentment
at
have
be
show
into
a
dungeon
.
  
<EOS>
the
drawer
have
obey
his
command
,
he
be
,
after
some
time
,
attend
by
the
barber
,
who
would
not
indeed
have
suffer
him
to
wait
so
long
for
his
company
<EOS>
have
he
not
be
listen
in
the
kitchen
to
the
landlady
,
who
be
entertain
a
circle
that
she
have
gather
round
her
with
the
history
of
poor
Jones
,
part
of
which
she
have
extract
from
his
own
lip
,
and
the
other
part
be
her
own
ingenious
composition
;
for
she
say
"
he
be
a
poor
parish
boy
,
take
into
the
house
of
Squire
Allworthy

where
he
be
breed
up

now
turn
out
of
door
for
his
misdeed

particularly
for
make
love
to
his
young
mistress

probably
for
rob
the
house
;
for
how
else
should
he
come
by
the
little
money
he
hath

why
he
tell
me
his

she
:

perhaps
he
go
by
a
wrong
name

nay

he
tell
me
,
too

that
the

have
maintain
him

he
have
quarrel
with

"

if
his
name
be
Jones

he
tell
you
the
truth
,

say
the
barber
;

for
I
have
relation
who
live
in

country

nay
,

some
people
say
he
be
his
son

<EOS>
"
why
doth
he

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not

not

<EOS>
"
Nay

if
I
think
he

thof
he
be
a
bye

blow

I
should
behave
to
him
in
another

for
many
of

come
to

<EOS>
a
dialogue
between
Mr
Jones
and
the
barber

<EOS>
this
conversation
pass
partly
while
Jones
be
at
dinner
in

dungeon

and
partly
while
he
be
expect

parlour

,
as
soon

Mr

have
say
,
attend

be
very
kindly

<EOS>
Jones
then
fill
out
a
glass
of

drank
his
health
by
the
appellation
of
doctissime

<EOS>
"
ago

say
the
barber
;
and
then
look
very
steadfastly
at
Jones
,
he
say
,
with
great
gravity
,
and
with
a
seeming
surprize
,
as
if
he
have
recollect
a
face
he
have

"
Sir

may
I
crave

Mr

I
find
you
do
not

indeed
be
no

you
never
see

once

then
you
be
very
young

<EOS>
"
Nay

I
would
not

for
that
be
a
vice

nobody
can

but
I
ask
pardon
;
for
when
a
gentleman
of

figure
travel
without
his
servant
,
we
may
suppose
him
to
be

as
we
say

have
tongue

allow

I
be
not
bear

assure
you

I
have
spend
most
of

I

it

I
understand
something

I
should
not

degrade
your

for
indeed
,
sir

some
people
have
not
use
you
well

for
besides
make
a
public
proclamation
of
what
you
tell
them
of
a

add
lie

I
tell
the

I
need
not

<EOS>
I
be
sure
it
move
me
to
hear
the

I
hope

You
will
pardon
me

therefore

hear
make
me
ask
many
question

I
have
no
impertinent
curiosity

I
love
good

nature

<EOS>
every
profession
of
friendship
easily
gain
credit
with
the
miserable
;
it
be
no
wonder
therefore
,
if
Jones
,
who
,
besides
his
be
miserable
,
be
extremely
open
-
hearted
,
very
readily
believe
all
the
profession
of
Benjamin

receive
him
into
his
bosom

<EOS>
the
scrap
of
Latin
,
some
of
which
Benjamin
apply
properly
enough
,
though
it
do
not
savour
of
profound
literature
,
seem
yet
to
indicate
something
superior
to
a
common
barber
;
and
so
indeed
do
his
whole
behaviour
.
<EOS>
Jones
therefore
believe
the
truth
of
what
he
have
say
,
as
to
his
original
and
education
;
and
at
length
,
after
much
entreaty
,
he
say
,
"
since
you
have
hear

my

so
much
of
my
affair

desirous

it

inform
you

I

I
be
very
much
oblige

you

honour
you
do
me

"
  
<EOS>
Jones
now
begin
,
and
relate
the
whole
history
,
forget
only
a
circumstance
or
two
,
namely
,
everything
which
pass
on
that
day
in
which
he
have
fight
with
Thwackum
;
and
end
with
his
resolution
to
go
to
sea
,
till
the
rebellion
in
the
North
have
make
him
change
his
purpose
,
and
have
bring
him
to
the
place
where
he
then
be
.
  
<EOS>
Little
Benjamin
,
who
have
be
all
attention
,
never
once
interrupt
the
narrative
;
but
when
it
be
end
he
could
not
help
observe
,
that
there
must
be
surely
something
more
invent
by
his
enemy
,
and
tell
Mr
Allworthy
against
him
,
or
so
good
<EOS>
a
man
would
never
have
dismiss
one
he
have
love
so
tenderly
,
in
such
a
manner
.
<EOS>
to
which
Jones
answer
,
"
He
doubt
not
but
such
villanous
art
have
be
make
use
of
to
destroy
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
surely
it
be
scarce
possible
for
any
one
to
have
avoid
make
the
same
remark
with
the
barber
,
who
have
not
indeed
hear
from
Jones
one
single
circumstance
upon
which
he
be
condemn
;
for
his
action
be
not
now
place
in
those
injurious
light
in
which
they
have
be
misrepresent
to
Allworthy
;
nor
could
he
mention
those
many
false
accusation
which
have
be
from
time
to
time
prefer
against
him
to
Allworthy
:
for
with
none
of
these
he
be
himself
acquaint
.
<EOS>
He
have
likewise
,
as
we
have
observe
,
omit
many
material
fact
in
his
present
relation
.
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
indeed
,
everything
now
appear
in
such
favourable
colour
to
Jones
,
that
malice
itself
would
have
find
it
no
easy
matter
to
fix
any
blame
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
not
that
Jones
desire
to
conceal
or
to
disguise
the
truth
;
nay
,
he
would
have
be
more
unwilling
to
have
suffer
any
censure
to
fall
on
Mr
Allworthy
for
punish
him
,
than
on
his
own
action
for
deserve
it
;
but
,
in
reality
,
so
it
happen
,
and
so
it
always
will
happen
;
for
let
a
man
be
never
so
honest
,
the
account
of
his
own
conduct

purify
through
his

and
,
like
foul
liquor
well
strained

will
leave
all
their
foulness
behind

<EOS>
for
though
the
fact
themselves
may
appear

yet
so
different
will
be
the
motive
,
circumstance
,
and
consequence
,
when
a
man
tell
his

story
,
and
when
his
enemy
tell
it
,
that
we
scarce
can
recognise
the
fact
to
be
one
and
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
though
the
barber
have
drink
down
this
story
with
greedy
ear
,
he
be
not
yet
satisfied

<EOS>
there
be
a
circumstance
behind

his

for

<EOS>
Jones
have
mention
the
fact
of
his

,
and
of
his
be
the
rival
of
Blifil

but
have
cautiously
conceal
the
name
of
the
young
lady
.
<EOS>
the
barber
,
therefore
,
after
some
hesitation
,
and
many
hum
and
hah
,
at
last
beg
leave
to
crave
the
name
of
the
lady
,
who
appear
to
be
the
principal
cause
of
all
this
mischief
.
<EOS>
Jones
pause
a
moment
,
and
then
say
,
"
since
I
have

upon

He
then
step

the

have

very

in

grow

I
be

reply
Jones
,
"

be
it
possible

all
the
ill

"
It

for
it

so

though
it
be
natural
enough

man
to
hate
even
the
innocent
cause

their
suffering

yet
I
be
of
a
different
temper

<EOS>
I
have
love
you
ever
since
I
hear
of
your
behaviour
to
Black
George

I
tell

you
be
bear
to
make
me
amend
for
all
I
have
suffer
on

<EOS>
besides

I
dreamt
,
the
night
before

that
I
stumble
over
a
stool
without
hurt
myself

<EOS>
which
plainly
show
me
something
good
be
towards
me

and
last
night
I
dreamt
again
,
that
I
ride
behind
you
on
a
milk
-
white
mare
,
which
be
a
very
excellent
dream
,

betoken
much
good
fortune

I
be
resolve

pursue

you
have
the
cruelty
to
deny
me

<EOS>
"
I
should
be
very
glad
,
Mr
Partridge

"
answer
Jones
,
"
to
have
it
in
my
power
to
make
you
amend
for
your
suffering
on
my
account
,
though
at
present
I
see
no
likelihood
of
it

however

I
assure
you
I
will
deny
you
nothing
which
be
in

to
grant

<EOS>
"
It
be
in
your
power
sure
enough

reply
Benjamin
;
"
for
I
desire
nothing
more
than
leave
to
attend
you
in
this
expedition
.
<EOS>
nay
,
I
have
so
entirely
set
my
heart
upon
it
,
that
if
you
should
refuse
me
,
you
will
kill
both
a
barber

a
surgeon
in
one
breath

<EOS>
Jones
answer
,
smile
,
that
he
should
be
very
sorry
to
be
the
occasion
of
so
much
mischief
to
the
public

<EOS>
He
then
advance
many
prudential
reason
,
in
order
to
dissuade
Benjamin

whom
we
shall
hereafter
call
Partridge
)
from
his
purpose
;
but
all
be
in
vain
.
<EOS>

strongly
on

"
<EOS>
besides
,

"
say
he
,
"
I
promise
you
I
have
as
good
an
inclination

the
cause
as
any
man

possibly
have

I
will

whether
you

<EOS>
Jones
,
who
be
as
much
pleased
with
Partridge
as
Partridge
could
be
with
him
,

who
have
not
consult
his
own
inclination

the
good
of
the
other
in
desire
him
to
stay
behind
,
when
he
find
his
friend
so
resolute

at
last
give
his
consent

then
recollect
himself

he

,
"
perhaps
,
Mr

you
think
I
shall
be
able

support

then
take
out
his

at

say
he
,

I
believe
I
be
rather
the
rich
man

two

all
I
have
be
at
your

at
your
disposal

I
insist

set
out
the
next
morning

a
difficulty
arise

the
baggage

portmanteau
of
Mr

large

this
portmanteau

with
everything
in

which
have
yet
appear
for
the
conduct
of
partridge
;
an
apology
for
the
weakness
of
Jones
;
and
some
further
anecdote
concern
my
landlady
.
 
<EOS>
Though
Partridge
be
one
of
the
most
superstitious
of
man
,
he
would
hardly
perhaps
have
desire
to
accompany
Jones
on
his
expedition
merely
from
the
omen
of
the
joint
-
stool
and
white
mare
,
if
his
prospect
have
be
no
well
than
to
have
share
the
plunder
gain
in
the
field
of
battle
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
when
Partridge
come
to
ruminate
on
the
relation
he
have
hear
from
Jones
,
he
could
not
reconcile
to
himself
that
Mr
Allworthy
should
turn
his
son
(
for
so
he
most
firmly
believe
him
to
be
)
out
of
door
,
for
any
reason
which
he
have
hear
assign
.
<EOS>
He
conclude
,
therefore
,
that
the
whole
be
a
fiction
,
and
that
Jones
,
of
whom
he
have
often
from
his
correspondent
hear
the
wild
character
,
have
in
reality
run
away
from
his
father
.
<EOS>
It
come
into
his
head
,
therefore
,
that
if
he
could
prevail
with
the
young
gentleman
to
return
back
to
his
father
,
he
should
by
that
mean
render
a
service
to
Allworthy
,
which
would
obliterate
all
his
former
anger
;
nay
,
indeed
,
he
conceive
that
very
anger
be
counterfeit
,
and
that
Allworthy
have
sacrifice
him
to
his
own
reputation
.
<EOS>
and
this
suspicion
indeed
he
well
account
for
,
from
the
tender
behaviour
of
that
excellent
man
to
the
foundle
child
;
from
his
great
severity
to
Partridge
,
who
,
know
himself
to
be
innocent
,
could
not
conceive
that
any
other
should
think
him
guilty
;
lastly
,
from
the
allowance
which
he
have
privately
receive
long
after
the
annuity
have
be
publickly
take
from
him
,
and
which
he
look
upon
as
a
kind
of
smart
-
money
,
or
rather
by
way
of
atonement
for
injustice
;
for
it
be
very
uncommon
,
I
believe
,
for
man
to
ascribe
the
benefaction
they
receive
to
pure
charity
,
when
they
can
possibly
impute
them
to
any
other
motive
.
<EOS>
if
he
could
by
any
mean
therefore
persuade
the
young
gentleman
to
return
home
,
he
doubt
not
but
that
he
should
again
be
receive
into
the
favour
of
Allworthy
,
and
well
reward
for
his
pain
;
nay
,
and
should
be
again
restore
to
his
native
country
;
a
restoration
which
ulysse
himself
never
wish
more
heartily
than
poor
Partridge
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Jones
,
he
be
well
satisfied
with
the
truth
of
what
the
other
have
assert
,
and
believe
that
Partridge
have
no
other
inducement
but
love
to
him
,
and
zeal
for
the
cause
;
a
blameable
want
of
caution
and
diffidence
in
the
veracity
of
other
,
in
which
he
be
highly
worthy
of
censure
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
there
be
but
two
way
by
which
man
become
possess
of
this
excellent
quality
.
<EOS>
the
one
be
from
long
experience
,
and
the
other
be
from
nature
;
which
last
,
I
presume
,
be
often
mean
by
genius
,
or
great
natural
part
;
and
it
be
infinitely
the
well
of
the
two
,
not
only
as
we
be
master
of
it
much
earlier
in
life
,
but
as
it
be
much
more
infallible
and
conclusive
;
for
a
man
who
hath
be
impose
on
by
ever
so
many
,
may
still
hope
to
find
other
more
honest
;
whereas
he
who
receive
certain
necessary
admonition
from
within
,
that
this
be
impossible
,
must
have
very
little
understanding
indeed
,
if
he
ever
render
himself
liable
to
be
once
deceive
.
<EOS>
as
Jones
have
not
this
gift
from
nature
,
he
be
too
young
to
have
gain
it
by
experience
;
for
at
the
diffident
wisdom
which
be
to
be
acquire
this
way
,
we
seldom
arrive
till
very
late
in
life
;
which
be
perhaps
the
reason
why
some
old
man
be
apt
to
despise
the
understanding
of
all
those
who
be
a
little
young
than
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
spend
most
part
of
the
day
in
the
company
of
a
new
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
this
be
no
other
than
the
landlord
of
the
house
,
or
rather
the
husband
of
the
landlady
.
<EOS>
He
have
but
lately
make
his
descent
downstairs
,
after
a
long
fit
of
the
gout
,
in
which
distemper
he
be
generally
confine
to
his
room
during
one
half
of
the
year
;
and
during
the
rest
,
he
walk
about
the
house
,
smoake
his
pipe
,
and
drink
his
bottle
with
his
friend
,
without
concern
himself
in
the
least
with
any
kind
of
business
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
breed
,
as
they
call
it
,
a
gentleman
;
that
is
,
breed
up
to
do
nothing
;
and
have
spend
a
very
small
fortune
,
which
he
inherit
from
an
industrious
farmer
his
uncle
,
in
hunting
,
horse
-
racing
,
and
cock
-
fighting
,
and
have
be
marry
by
my
landlady
for
certain
purpose
,
which
he
have
long
since
desist
from
answer
;
for
which
she
hate
him
heartily
.
<EOS>
but
as
he
be
a
surly
kind
of
fellow
,
so
she
content
herself
with
frequently
upbraid
him
by
disadvantageous
comparison
with
her
first
husband
,
whose
praise
she
have
eternally
in
her
mouth
;
and
as
she
be
for
the
most
part
mistress
of
the
profit
,
so
she
be
satisfied
to
take
upon
herself
the
care
and
government
of
the
family
,
and
,
after
a
long
successless
struggle
,
to
suffer
her
husband
to
be
master
of
himself
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
evening
,
when
Jones
retire
to
his
room
,
a
small
dispute
arise
between
this
fond
couple
concern
him
:
 
<EOS>
"
what
,
"
say
the
wife
,
"
you
have
be
tipple
with
the
gentleman
,
I
see
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
answer
the
husband
,
"
we
have
crack
a
bottle
together
,
and
a
very
gentlemanlike
man
he
be
,
and
hath
a
very
pretty
notion
of
horse
-
flesh
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
be
young
,
and
hath
not
see
much
of
the
world
;
for
I
believe
he
hath
be
at
very
few
horse
-
race
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oho
!
<EOS>
he
be
one
of
your
order
,
be
he
?
<EOS>
"
reply
the
landlady
:
"
he
must
be
a
gentleman
to
be
sure
,
if
he
be
a
horse
-
racer
.
<EOS>
the
devil
fetch
such
gentry
!
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
wish
I
have
never
see
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
have
reason
to
love
horse
-
racer
truly
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
you
have
,
"
say
the
husband
;
"
for
I
be
one
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
answer
she
,
"
you
be
a
pure
one
indeed
.
<EOS>
as
my
first
husband
use
to
say
,
I
may
put
all
the
good
I
have
ever
get
by
you
in
my
eye
,
and
see
never
the
bad
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
D####n
your
first
husband
!
"
<EOS>
cry
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
not
d####n
a
well
man
than
yourself
<EOS>
,
"
answer
the
wife
:
"
if
he
have
be
alive
,
you
durst
not
have
do
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
think
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
have
not
so
much
courage
as
yourself
;
for
you
have
d####n'd
him
often
in
my
hearing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
I
do
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
have
repent
of
it
<EOS>
many
be
the
good
time
and
oft
.
<EOS>
and
if
he
be
so
good
to
forgive
me
a
word
speak
in
haste
or
so
<EOS>
,
it
doth
not
become
such
a
one
as
you
to
twitter
me
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
husband
to
me
,
he
be
;
and
if
ever
I
do
make
use
of
an
ill
word
or
so
in
a
passion
,
I
never
call
him
rascal
;
I
should
have
tell
a
lie
,
if
I
have
call
him
rascal
.
"
<EOS>
much
more
she
say
,
but
not
in
his
hearing
;
for
have
light
his
pipe
,
he
stagger
off
as
fast
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
We
shall
therefore
transcribe
no
more
of
her
speech
,
as
it
approach
still
near
and
near
to
a
subject
too
indelicate
to
find
any
place
in
this
history
.
  
<EOS>
early
in
the
morning
Partridge
appear
at
the
bedside
of
Jones
,
ready
equip
for
the
journey
,
with
his
knapsack
at
his
back
.
<EOS>
this
be
his
own
workmanship
;
for
besides
his
other
trade
,
he
be
no
indifferent
taylor
.
<EOS>
He
have
already
put
up
his
whole
stock
of
linen
in
it
,
consist
of
four
shirt
,
to
which
he
now
add
eight
for
Mr
Jones
;
and
then
pack
up
the
portmanteau
,
he
be
depart
with
it
towards
his
own
house
,
but
be
stopt
in
his
way
by
the
landlady
,
who
refuse
to
suffer
any
removal
till
after
the
payment
of
the
reckoning
.
  
<EOS>
the
landlady
be
,
as
we
have
say
,
absolute
governess
in
these
region
;
it
be
therefore
necessary
to
comply
with
her
rule
;
so
the
bill
be
presently
writ
out
,
which
amount
to
a
much
large
sum
than
may
have
be
expect
,
from
the
entertainment
which
Jones
have
meet
with
.
<EOS>
but
here
we
be
oblige
to
disclose
some
maxim
,
which
publican
hold
to
be
the
grand
mystery
of
their
trade
.
<EOS>
the
first
be
,
if
they
have
anything
good
in
their
house
(
which
indeed
very
seldom
happen
)
to
produce
it
only
to
person
who
travel
with
great
equipage
.
<EOS>
2dly
,
to
charge
the
same
for
the
very
bad
provision
,
as
if
they
be
the
good
.
<EOS>
and
lastly
,
if
any
of
their
guest
call
but
for
little
,
to
make
them
pay
a
double
price
for
everything
they
have
;
so
that
the
amount
by
the
head
may
be
much
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
the
bill
be
make
and
discharge
,
Jones
set
forward
with
Partridge
,
carry
his
knapsack
;
nor
do
the
landlady
condescend
to
wish
him
a
good
journey
;
for
this
be
,
it
seem
,
an
inn
frequent
by
people
of
fashion
;
and
I
know
not
whence
it
be
,
but
all
those
who
get
their
livelihood
by
people
of
fashion
,
contract
as
much
insolence
to
the
rest
of
mankind
,
as
if
they
really
belong
to
that
rank
themselves
.
    
<EOS>
Jones
arrive
at
Gloucester
,
and
go
to
the
Bell
;
the
character
of
that
house
,
and
of
a
petty
-
fogger
which
he
there
meet
with
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jones
and
Partridge
,
or
Little
Benjamin
(
which
epithet
of
Little
be
perhaps
give
him
ironically
,
he
be
in
reality
near
six
foot
high
)
,
have
leave
their
last
quarter
in
the
manner
before
describe
,
travel
on
to
Gloucester
without
meet
any
adventure
worth
relate
.
  
<EOS>
be
arrive
here
,
they
choose
for
their
house
of
entertainment
the
sign
of
the
Bell
,
an
excellent
house
indeed
,
and
which
I
do
most
seriously
recommend
to
every
reader
who
shall
visit
this
antient
city
.
<EOS>
the
master
of
it
be
brother
to
the
great
preacher
Whitefield
;
but
be
absolutely
untainted
with
the
pernicious
principle
of
Methodism
,
or
of
any
other
heretical
sect
.
<EOS>
He
be
indeed
a
very
honest
plain
man
,
and
,
in
my
opinion
,
not
likely
to
create
any
disturbance
either
in
church
or
state
.
<EOS>
His
wife
hath
,
I
believe
,
have
much
pretension
to
beauty
,
and
be
still
a
very
fine
woman
.
<EOS>
Her
person
and
deportment
may
have
make
a
shining
figure
in
the
politest
assembly
;
but
though
she
must
be
conscious
of
this
and
many
other
perfection
,
she
seem
perfectly
content
with
,
and
resign
to
,
that
state
of
life
to
which
she
be
call
;
and
this
resignation
be
entirely
owing
to
the
prudence
and
wisdom
of
her
temper
;
for
she
be
at
present
as
free
from
any
Methodistical
notion
as
her
husband
:
I
say
at
present
;
for
she
freely
confess
that
her
brother
's
document
make
at
first
some
impression
upon
her
,
and
that
she
have
put
herself
to
the
expense
of
a
long
hood
,
in
order
to
attend
the
extraordinary
emotion
of
the
Spirit
;
but
have
find
,
during
an
experiment
of
three
week
,
no
emotion
,
she
say
,
worth
a
farthing
,
she
very
wisely
lay
by
her
hood
,
and
abandon
the
sect
.
<EOS>
to
be
concise
,
she
be
a
very
friendly
good
-
natured
woman
;
and
so
industrious
to
oblige
,
that
the
guest
must
be
of
a
very
morose
disposition
who
be
not
extremely
well
satisfied
in
her
house
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Whitefield
happen
to
be
in
the
yard
when
Jones
and
his
attendant
march
in
.
<EOS>
Her
sagacity
soon
discover
in
the
air
of
our
heroe
something
which
distinguish
him
from
the
vulgar
.
<EOS>
She
order
her
servant
,
therefore
,
immediately
to
show
him
into
a
room
,
and
presently
afterwards
invite
him
to
dinner
with
herself
;
which
invitation
he
very
thankfully
accept
;
for
indeed
much
less
agreeable
company
than
that
of
Mrs
Whitefield
,
and
a
much
bad
entertainment
than
she
have
provide
,
would
have
be
welcome
after
so
long
fasting
and
so
long
a
walk
.
  
<EOS>
besides
Mr
Jones
and
the
good
governess
of
the
mansion
,
there
sit
down
at
table
<EOS>
an
attorney
of
Salisbury
,
indeed
the
very
same
who
have
bring
the
news
of
Mrs
Blifil
's
death
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
and
whose
name
,
which
I
think
we
do
not
before
mention
,
be
dowle
:
<EOS>
there
be
likewise
present
another
person
,
who
stile
himself
a
lawyer
,
and
who
live
somewhere
near
Linlinch
,
in
Somersetshire
.
<EOS>
this
fellow
,
I
say
,
stile
himself
a
lawyer
,
but
be
indeed
a
most
vile
petty
-
fogger
,
without
sense
or
knowledge
of
any
kind
;
one
of
those
who
may
be
term
train
-
bearer
to
the
law
;
a
sort
of
supernumerary
in
the
profession
,
who
be
the
hackney
of
attorney
,
and
will
ride
more
mile
for
half
-
a
-
crown
than
a
postboy
.
  
<EOS>
during
the
time
of
dinner
,
the
Somersetshire
lawyer
recollect
the
face
of
Jones
,
which
he
have
see
at
Mr
Allworthy
's
;
for
he
have
often
visit
in
that
gentleman
's
kitchen
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
take
occasion
to
enquire
after
the
good
family
there
with
that
familiarity
which
would
have
become
an
intimate
friend
or
acquaintance
of
Mr
Allworthy
;
and
indeed
he
do
all
in
his
power
to
insinuate
himself
to
be
such
,
though
he
have
never
have
the
honour
of
speak
to
any
person
in
that
family
high
than
the
butler
.
<EOS>
Jones
answer
all
his
question
with
much
civility
,
though
he
never
remember
to
have
see
the
petty
-
fogger
before
;
and
though
he
conclude
,
from

Mr

"
  
<EOS>
Petty

fogger
call
to
mind
that
he
have
not
be
swear
,
as
he
usually
be
,
before
he
give
his
evidence

now
bind
what
he
have
declare
with
so
many
oath
and
imprecation
that
the
landlady

ear
be
shock
,
and
she
put
a
stop
to
his
swearing
,
by
assure
him
of
her
belief

<EOS>
upon
which
he
say
,
"
I
hope
,
madam
,
you
imagine
I
would
scorn
to
tell
such
thing
of
any
man
,
unless
I
know
them
to
be
true
.
<EOS>
what
interest
have
I
in
take
away
the
reputation
of
a
man
who
never
injure
me
?
<EOS>
I
promise
you
every
syllable
of
what
I
have
say
be
fact
,
and
the
whole
country
know
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
Mrs
Whitefield
have
no
reason
to
suspect
that
the
petty
-
fogger
have
any
motive
or
temptation
to
abuse
Jones
,
the
reader
can
not
blame
her
for
believe
what
he
so
confidently
affirm
with
many
oath
.
<EOS>
She
accordingly
give
up
her
skill
in
physiognomy
,
and
hence
-
forwards
conceive
so
ill
an
opinion
of
her
guest
,
that
she
heartily
wish
him
out
of
her
house
.
  
<EOS>
this
dislike
be
now
farther
increase
by
a
report
which
Mr
Whitefield
make
from
the
kitchen
,
where
Partridge
have
inform
the
company
,
"
that
though
he
carry
the
knapsack
,
and
content
himself
with
stay
among
servant
,
while
Tom
Jones
(
as
he
call
him
)
be
regale
in
the
parlour
,
he
be
not
his
servant
,
but
only
a
friend
and
companion
,
and
as
good
a
gentleman
as
Mr
Jones
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
dowling
sit
all
this
while
silent
,
bite
his
finger
,
make
face
,
grin
,
and
look
wonderfully
arch
;
at
last
he
open
his
lip
,
and
protest
that
the
gentleman
look
like
another
sort
of
man
.
<EOS>
He
then
call
for
his
bill
with
the
utmost
haste
,
declare
he
must
be
at
Hereford
that
evening
,
lament
his
great
hurry
of
business
,
and
wish
he
could
divide
himself
into
twenty
piece
,
in
order
to
be
at
once
in
twenty
place
.
  
<EOS>
the
petty
-
fogger
now
likewise
depart
,
and
then
Jones
desire
the
favour
of
Mrs
Whitefield
's
company
to
drink
tea
with
him
;
but
she
refuse
,
and
with
a
manner
so
different
from
that
with
which
she
have
receive
him
at
dinner
,
that
it
a
little
surprize
him
.
<EOS>
and
now
he
soon
perceive
her
behaviour
totally
change
;
for
instead
of
that
natural
affability
which
we
have
before
celebrate
,
she
wear
a
constrained
severity
on
her
countenance
,
which
be
so
disagreeable
to
Mr
Jones
,
that
he
resolve
,
however
late
,
to
quit
the
house
that
evening
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
indeed
account
somewhat
unfairly
for
this
sudden
change
;
for
besides
some
hard
and
unjust
surmise
concern
female
fickleness
and
mutability
,
he
begin
to
suspect
that
he
owe
this
want
of
civility
to
his
want
of
horse
;
a
sort
of
animal
which
,
as
they
dirty
no
sheet
,
be
think
in
inn
to
pay
well
for
their
bed
than
their
rider
,
and
be
therefore
consider
as
the
more
desirable
company
;
but
Mrs
Whitefield
,
to
do
her
justice
,
have
a
much
more
liberal
way
of
thinking
.
<EOS>
She
be
perfectly
well
-
breed
,
and
could
be
very
civil
to
a
gentleman
,
though
he
walk
on
foot
.
<EOS>
in
reality
,
she
look
on
our
heroe
as
a
sorry
scoundrel
,
and
therefore
treat
him
as
such
,
for
which
not
even
Jones
himself
,
have
he
know
as
much
as
the
reader
,
could
have
blame
her
;
nay
,
on
the
contrary
,
he
must
have
approve
her
conduct
,
and
have
esteem
her
the
more
for
the
disrespect
show
towards
himself
.
<EOS>
this
be
indeed
a
most
aggravating
circumstance
,
which
attend
deprive
man
unjustly
of
their
reputation
;
for
a
man
who
be
conscious
of
have
an
ill
character
,
can
not
justly
be
angry
with
those
who
neglect
and
slight
him
;
but
ought
rather
to
despise
such
as
affect
his
conversation
,
unless
where
a
perfect
intimacy
must
have
convince
them
that
their
friend
's
character
hath
be
falsely
and
injuriously
asperse
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
not
,
however
,
the
case
of
Jones
;
for
as
he
be
a
perfect
stranger
to
the
truth
,
so
he
be
with
good
reason
offend
at
the
treatment
he
receive
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
pay
his
reckoning
and
depart
,
highly
against
the
will
of
Mr
Partridge
,
who
have
remonstrate
much
against
it
to
no
purpose
,
at
last
condescend
to
take
up
his
knapsack
and
to
attend
his
friend
.
    
<EOS>
contain
several
dialogue
between
Jones
and
Partridge
,
concern
love
,
cold
,
hunger
,
and
other
matter
;
with
the
lucky
and
narrow
escape
of
Partridge
,
as
he
be
on
the
very
brink
of
make
a
fatal
discovery
to
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
the
shadow
begin
now
to
descend
large
from
the
high
mountain
;
the
feather
creation
have
betake
themselves
to
their
rest
.
<EOS>
now
the
high
order
of
mortal
be
sit
down
to
their
dinner
,
and
the
low
order
to
their
supper
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
the
clock
strike
five
just
as
Mr
Jones
take
his
leave
of
Gloucester
;
an
hour
at
which
(
as
it
be
now
mid
-
winter
)
<EOS>
the
dirty
finger
of
Night
would
have
draw
her
sable
curtain
over
the
universe
,
have
not
the
moon
forbid
her
,
who
now
<EOS>
,
with
a
face
as
broad
and
as
red
as
those
of
some
jolly
mortal
,
who
,
like
her
,
turn
night
into
day
,
begin
to
rise
from
her
bed
,
where
she
have
slumber
away
the
day
,
in
order
to
sit
up
all
night
.
<EOS>
Jones
have
not
travel
far
before
he
pay
his
compliment
to
that
beautiful
planet
,
and
,
turn
to
his
companion
,
ask
him
if
he
have
ever
behold
so
delicious
an
evening
?
<EOS>
partridge
make
no
ready
answer
to
his
question
,
he
proceed
to
comment
on
the
beauty
of
the
moon
,
and
repeat
some
passage
from
Milton
,
who
hath
certainly
excel
all
other
poet
in
his
description
of
the
heavenly
luminary
.
<EOS>
He
then
tell
Partridge
the
story
from
the
Spectator
,
of
two
lover
who
have
agree
to
entertain
themselves
when
they
be
at
a
great
distance
from
each
other
,
by
repair
,
at
a
certain
fix
hour
,
to
look
at
the
moon
;
thus
please
themselves
with
the
thought
that
they
be
both
employ
in
contemplate
the
same
object
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
those
lover
,
"
add
he
,
"
must
have
have
soul
truly
capable
of
feel
all
the
tenderness
of
the
sublime
of
all
human
passion

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
probably
,
"
cry
partridge
:
"
<EOS>
but
I
envy
them
more
,
if
they
have
body
incapable
of
feel
cold
;
for
I
be
almost
freeze
to
death
,
and
be
very
much
afraid
I
shall
lose
a
piece
of
my
nose
before
we
get
to
another
house
of
entertainment
.
<EOS>
nay
,
truly
,
we
may
well
expect
some
judgment
should
happen
to
us
for
our
folly
in
run
away
so
by
night
from
one
of
the
most
excellent
inn
I
ever
set
my
foot
into
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
never
see
more
good
thing
in
my
life
,

the
great
lord
in
the
land
can
not

better
in

may
there

the
Lord

I
say
nothing
for

not

charity
enough

sober

"
 
<EOS>
"
fie
upon
it

Mr
Partridge

say
Jones
,
"
have
a

consider
you

answer
Partridge

the

the
road

<EOS>
a
good

pace
will
bring
us
back
to
Gloucester
in
an
hour
;
but
if
we
go
forward
,
the
Lord
Harry
know
when
we
shall
arrive
at
any
place
;
for
I
see
at

fifty

before

no

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
indeed
,
a
very
fair
prospect

say
Jones
,
"
which
receive
great
additional
beauty
from
the
extreme
lustre
of
the
moon

<EOS>
however
,
I
will
keep
the
left

track

that
seem
to
lead
directly
to
those

here

you
may

back
again

for

It

to
suspect
me

<EOS>
what
I
have
advise
hath
be
as
much
on

on

I
be

much
determine

<EOS>
They
now
travel
some
mile
without
speak
to
each
other

during

suspense
of
discourse
Jones
often
sigh
,

Benjamin
groan
as
bitterly

from

at

make

I
have
taste
all
the
tenderness
,
and
sublimity
,
and
bitterness
of
the
passion
.
"
<EOS>
"
be
your
mistress
unkind
,
then
?
"
say
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
very
unkind
,
indeed
,
sir
,
"
answer
Partridge
;
"
for
she
marry
me
,
and
make
one
of
the
most
confound
wife
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
however
,
heaven
be
praise
,
she
be
go
;
and
if
I
believe
she
be
in
the
moon
,
accord
to
a
book
I
once
read
,
which
teach
that
to
be
the
receptacle
of
depart
spirit
,
I
would
never
look
at
it
for
fear
of
see
her
;
but
I
wish
,
sir
,
that
the
moon
be
a
looking
-
glass
for
your
sake
,
and
that
Miss
Sophia
Western
be
now
place
before
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
My
dear
partridge
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
what
a
thought
be
there
!
<EOS>
a
thought
which
I
be
certain
could
never
have
enter
into
any
mind
but
that
of
a
lover
.
<EOS>
o
Partridge
!
<EOS>
could
I
hope
once
again
to
see
that
face
;
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
all
those
golden
dream
be
vanish
for
ever
,
and
my
only
refuge
from
future
misery
be
to
forget
the
object
of
all
my
former
happiness
.
"
<EOS>
"
and
do
you
really
despair
of
ever
see
Miss
Western
again
?
"
answer
Partridge
;
"
if
you
will
follow
my
advice
I
will
engage
you
shall
not
only
see
her
but
have
her
in
your
arm
.
"
<EOS>
"
ha
!
do
not
awaken
a
thought
of
that
nature
,
"
cry
Jones
:
"
I
have
struggle
sufficiently
to
conquer
all
such
wish
already
.
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
answer
Partridge
,
"
if
you
do
not
wish
to
have
your
mistress
in
your
arm
you
be
a
most
extraordinary
lover
indeed
.
"
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
let
us
avoid
this
subject
;
but
pray
what
be
your
advice
?
"
<EOS>
"
to
give
it
you
in
the
military
phrase
,
then
,
"
say
Partridge
,
"
as
we
be
soldier
,
"
to
the
right
about
.
<EOS>
"
let
us
return
the
way
we
come
;
we
may
yet
reach
Gloucester
to
-
night
,
though
late
;
whereas
,
if
we
proceed
,
we
be
likely
,
for
aught
I
see
,
to
ramble
about
for
ever
without
come
either
to
house
or
home
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
tell
you
my
resolution
be
to
go
on
,
"
answer
Jones
;
"
but
I
would
have
you
go
back
.
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
you
for
your
company
hither
;
and
I
beg
you
to
accept
a
guinea
as
a
small
instance
of
my
gratitude
.
<EOS>
nay
,
it
would
be
cruel
in
me
to
suffer
you
to
go
any
farther
;
for
,
to
deal
plainly
with
you
,
my
chief
end
and
desire
be
a
glorious
death
in
the
service
of
my
king
and
country
.
"
<EOS>
"
as
for
your
money
,
"
reply
Partridge
,
"
I
beg
,
sir
,
you
will
put
it
up
;
I
will
receive
none
of
you
at
this
time
;
for
at
present
I
be
,
I
believe
,
the
rich
man
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
and
as
your
resolution
be
to
go
on
,
so
mine
be
to
follow
you
if
you
do
.
<EOS>
nay
,
now
my
presence
appear
absolutely
necessary
to
take
care
of
you
,
since
your
intention
be
so
desperate
;
for
I
promise
you
my
view
be
much
more
prudent
;
as
you
be
resolve
to
fall
in
battle
if
you
can
,
so
I
be
resolve
as
firmly
to
come
to
no
hurt
if
I
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
I
have
the
comfort
to
think
there
will
be
but
<EOS>
little
danger
;
for
a
popish
priest
tell
me
the
other
day
the
business
would
soon
be
over
,
and
he
believe
without
a
battle
.
"
<EOS>
"
a
popish
priest
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Jones
,
"
I
have
hear
be
not
always
to
be
believe
when
he
speak
in
behalf
of
his
religion
.
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
but
so
far
,
"
answer
the
other
,
"
from
speak
in
behalf
of
his
religion
,
he
assure
me
the
Catholicks
do
not
expect
to
be
any
gainer
by
the
change
;
for
that
Prince
Charles
be
as
good
a
Protestant
as
any
in
England
;
and
that
nothing
but
regard
to
right
make
him
and
the
rest
of
the
popish
party
to
be
Jacobites
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
him
to
be
as
much
a
Protestant
as
I
believe
he
hath
any
right
,
"
say
Jones
;
"
and
I
make
no
doubt
of
our
success
,
but
not
without
a
battle
.
<EOS>
so
that
I
be
not
so
sanguine
as
your
friend
the
popish
priest
.
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
to
be
sure
,
sir
,
"
answer
Partridge
,
"
all
the
prophecy
I
have
ever
read
speak
of
a
great
deal
of
blood
to
be
spill
in
the
quarrel
,
and
the
miller
with
three
thumb
,
who
be
now
alive
,
be
to
hold
the
horse
of
three
king
,
up
to
his
knee
in
blood
.
<EOS>
Lord
,
have
mercy
upon
us
all
,
and
send
well
time
!
"
<EOS>
"
with
what
stuff
and
nonsense
hast
thou
fill
thy
head
!
"
<EOS>
answer
Jones
:
"
this
too
,
I
suppose
,
come
from
the
popish
priest
.
<EOS>
monster
and
prodigy
be
the
proper
argument
to
support
monstrous
and
absurd
doctrine
.
<EOS>
the
cause
of
King
George
be
the
cause
of
liberty
and
true
religion
.
<EOS>
in
other
word
,
it
be
the
cause
of
common
sense
,
my
boy
,
and
I
warrant
you
will
succeed
,
though
Briarius
himself
be
to
rise
again
with
his
hundred
thumb
,
and
to
turn
miller
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
partridge
make
no
reply
to
this
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
indeed
,
cast
into
the
utmost
confusion
by
this
declaration
of
Jones
.
<EOS>
for
,
to
inform
the
reader
of
a
secret
,
which
he
have
no
proper
opportunity
of
reveal
before
,
Partridge
be
in
truth
a
Jacobite
,
and
have
conclude
that
Jones
be
of
the
same
party
,
and
be
now
proceed
to
join
the
rebel
.
<EOS>
an
opinion
which
be
not
without
foundation
.
<EOS>
for
the
tall
,
long
-
sided
dame
,
mention
by
Hudibras
 
that
many
-
eyed
,
many
-
tongued
,
many
-
mouthed
,
many
-
eared
monster
of
Virgil
,
have
relate
the
story
of
the
quarrel
between
Jones
and
the
officer
,
with
the
usual
regard
to
truth
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
indeed
,
change
the
name
of
Sophia
into
that
of
the
Pretender
,
and
have
report
,
that
drink
his
health
be
the
cause
for
which
Jones
be
knock
down
.
<EOS>
this
Partridge
have
hear
,
and
most
firmly
believe
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
no
wonder
,
therefore
,
that
he
have
thence
entertain
the
above
-
mention
opinion
of
Jones
;
and
which
he
have
almost
discover
to
him
before
he
find
out
his
own
mistake
.
<EOS>
and
at
this
the
reader
will
be
the
less
inclined
to
wonder
,
if
he
please
to
recollect
the
doubtful
phrase
in
which
Jones
first
communicate
his
resolution
to
Mr
Partridge
;
and
,
indeed
,
have
the
word
be
less
ambiguous
,
Partridge
may
very
well
have
construe
them
as
he
do
;
be
persuade
as
he
be
that
the
whole
nation
be
of
the
same
inclination
in
their
heart
;
nor
do
it
stagger
him
that
Jones
have
travel
in
the
company
of
soldier
;
for
he
have
the
same
opinion
of
the
army
which
he
have
of
the
rest
of
the
people
.
  
<EOS>
but
however
well
affected
he
may
be
to
James
or
Charles
<EOS>
,
he
be
still
much
more
attached
to
Little
Benjamin
than
to
either
;
for
which
reason
he
no
sooner
discover
the
principle
of
his
fellow
-
traveller
than
he
think
proper
to
conceal
and
outwardly
give
up
his
own
to
the
man
on
whom
he
depend
for
the
make
his
fortune
,
since
he
by
no
means
believe
the
affair
of
Jones
to
be
so
desperate
as
they
really
be
with
Mr
Allworthy
;
for
as
he
have
keep
a
constant
correspondence
with
some
of
his
neighbour
since
he
leave
that
country
,
he
have
hear
much
,
indeed
more
than
be
true
,
of
the
great
affection
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
bear
this
young
man
,
who
,
as
Partridge
have
be
instruct
,
be
to
be
that
gentleman
's
heir
,
and
whom
<EOS>
,
as
we
have
say
,
he
do
not
in
the
least
doubt
to
be
his
son
.
  
<EOS>
He
imagine
therefore
that
whatever
quarrel
be
between
them
,
it
would
be
certainly
make
up
at
the
return
of
Mr
Jones
;
an
event
from
which
he
promise
great
advantage
,
if
he
could
take
this
opportunity
of
ingratiate
himself
with
that
young
gentleman
;
and
if
he
could
by
any
mean
be
instrumental
in
procure
his
return
,
he
doubt
not
,
as
we
have
before
say
,
but
it
would
as
highly
advance
him
in
the
favour
of
Mr
Allworthy
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
already
observe
,
that
he
be
a
very
good
-
natured
fellow
,
and
he
hath
himself
declare
the
violent
attachment
he
have
to
the
person
and
character
of
Jones
;
but
<EOS>
possibly
the
view
which
I
have
just
before
mention
,
may
likewise
have
some
little
share
in
prompt
him
to
undertake
this
expedition
,
at
least
in
urge
him
to
continue
it
,
after
he
have
discover
that
his
master
and
himself
,
like
some
prudent
father
and
son
,
though
they
travel
together
in
great
friendship
,
have
embrace
opposite
party
.
<EOS>
I
be
lead
into
this
conjecture
,
by
have
remark
,
that
though
love
,
friendship
,
esteem
,
and
such
like
,
have
very
powerful
operation
in
the
human
mind
;
interest
,
however
,
be
an
ingredient
seldom
omit
by
wise
man
,
when
they
would
work
other
to
their
own
purpose
.
<EOS>
this
be
indeed
a
most
excellent
medicine
,
and
,
like
Ward
's
pill
,
fly
at
once
to
the
particular
part
of
the
body
on
which
you
desire
to
operate
,
whether
it
be
the
tongue
,
the
hand
,
or
any
other
member
,
where
it
scarce
ever
fail
of
immediately
produce
the
desire
effect
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
our
traveller
meet
with
a
very
extraordinary
adventure
.
 
<EOS>
just
as
Jones
and
his
friend
come
to
the
end
of
their
dialogue
in
the
precede
chapter
,
they
arrive
at
the
bottom
of
a
very
steep
hill
.
<EOS>
here
Jones
stopt
short
,
and
direct
his
eye
upwards
,
stand
for
a
while
silent
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
call
to
his
companion
,
and
say
,
"
Partridge
,
I
wish
I
be
at
the
top
of
this
hill
;
it
must
certainly
afford
a
most
charming
prospect
,
especially
by
this
light
;
for
the
solemn
gloom
which
the
moon
cast
on
all
object
,
be
beyond
expression
beautiful
,
especially
to
an
imagination
which
be
desirous
of
cultivate
melancholy
idea
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
probably
,
"
answer
Partridge
;
"
but
if
the
top
of
the
hill
be
properest
to
produce
melancholy
thought
,
I
suppose
the
bottom
be
the
likeliest
to
produce
merry
one
,
and
these
I
take
to
be
much
the
well
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
I
protest
you
have
make
my
blood
run
cold
with
the
very
mention
the
top
of
that
mountain
;
which
seem
to
me
to
be
one
of
the
high
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
if
we
look
for
anything
,
let
it
be
for
a
place
under
ground
,
to
screen
ourselves
from
the
frost
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
so
,
"
say
Jones
;
"
let
it
be
<EOS>
but
within
hearing
of
this
place
,
<EOS>
and
I
will
hallow
to
you
at
my
return
back
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
surely
,
sir
,
you
be
not
mad
,
"
say
Partridge
.
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
I
be
,
"
answer
Jones
,
"
if
ascend
this
hill
be
madness
;
but
as
you
complain
so
much
of
the
cold
already
,
I
would
have
you
stay
below
.
<EOS>
I
will
certainly
return
to
you
within
an
hour
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
pardon
me
,
sir
,
"
cry
Partridge
;
"
I
have
determine
to
follow
you
wherever
you
go
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
indeed
he
be
now
afraid
to
stay
behind
;
for
though
he
be
coward
enough
in
all
respect
,
yet
his
chief
fear
be
that
of
ghost
,
with
which
the
present
time
of
night
,
and
the
wildness
of
the
place
,
extremely
well
suited
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
instant
Partridge
espy
a
glimmering
light
through
some
tree
,
which
seem
very
near
to
them
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
cry
out
in
a
rapture
,
"
oh
,
sir
!
<EOS>
Heaven
hath
at
last
hear
my
prayer
,
and
hath
bring
us
to
a
house
;
perhaps
it
may
be
an
inn
.
<EOS>
let
me
beseech
you
,
sir
,
if
you
have
any
compassion
either
for
me
or
yourself
,
do
not
despise
the
goodness
of
Providence
,
but
let
us
go
directly
to
yon
light
.
<EOS>
whether
it
be
a
public
-
house
or
no
,
I
be
sure
if
they
be
Christians
that
dwell
there
,
they
will
not
refuse
a
little
house
-
room
to
person
in
our
miserable
condition
.
"
<EOS>
Jones
at
length
yield
to
the
earnest
supplication
of
Partridge
,
and
both
together
make
directly
towards
the
place
whence
<EOS>
the
light
issue
.
  
<EOS>
They
soon
arrive
at
the
door
of
this
house
,
or
cottage
,
for
it
may
be
call
either
,
without
much
impropriety
.
<EOS>
here
Jones
knock
several
time
without
receive
any
answer
from
within
;
at
which
Partridge
,
whose
head
be
full
of
nothing
but
of
ghost
,
devil
,
witch
,
and
such
like
,
begin
to
tremble
,
cry
,
"
Lord
,
have
mercy
upon
us
!
<EOS>
surely
the
people
must
be
all
dead
.
<EOS>
I
can
see
no
light
neither
now
,
and
yet
I
be
certain
I
see
a
candle
burning
<EOS>
but
a
moment
before
.
 
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
I
have
hear
of
such
thing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
hast
thou
hear
of
?
"
say
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
the
people
be
either
fast
asleep
,
or
probably
,
as
this
be
a
lonely
place
,
be
afraid
to
open
their
door
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
then
begin
to
vociferate
pretty
loudly
,
and
at
last
an
old
woman
,
open
an
upper
casement
,
ask
,
who
they
be
,
and
what
they
want
?
<EOS>
Jones
answer
,
They
be
traveller
who
have
lose
their
way
,
and
have
see
a
light
in
the
window
,
have
be
lead
thither
in
hope
of
find
some
fire

warm
themselves

"
whoever
you
be

"
cry
the
woman
,
"
you
have
no
business
here
;
nor
shall
I
open
the
door
to
any
one

"
<EOS>
Partridge
,
whom
the
sound
of
a
human
voice
have
recover
from
his
fright
,
fall
to
the
most
earnest
supplication
to
be
admit
for
a
few
minute
to
the
fire
,
say
,
he
be
almost
dead
with
the
cold
;
to
which
fear
have
indeed
contribute
equally
with
the
frost
.
<EOS>
He
assure
her
that
the
gentleman
who
speak
to
her
be
one
of
the
great
squire
in
the
country
;
and
make
use
of
every
argument
,
save
one
,
which
Jones
afterwards
effectually
add
;
and
this
be
,
the
promise
of
half
-
a
-
crown
;
 
a
bribe
too
great
to
be
resist
by
such
a
person
,
especially
as
the
genteel
appearance
of
Jones
,
which
the
light
of
the
moon
plainly
discover
to
her
,
together
with
his
affable
behaviour
,
have
entirely
subdue
those
apprehension
of
thief
which
she
have
at
first
conceive
.
<EOS>
She
agree
,
therefore
,
at
last
,
to
let
them
in
;
where
Partridge
,
to
his
infinite
joy
,
find
a
good
fire
ready
for
his
reception
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
fellow
,
however
,
have
no
sooner
warm
himself
,
than
those
thought
which
be
always
uppermost
in
his
mind
,
begin
a
little
to
disturb
his
brain
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
article
of
his
creed
in
which
he
have
a
strong
faith
than
he
have
in
witchcraft
,
nor
can
the
reader
conceive
a
figure
more
adapt
to
inspire
this
idea
,
than
the
old
woman
who
now
stand
before
him
.
<EOS>
She
answer
exactly
to
that
picture
draw
by
Otway
in
his
Orphan
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
if
this
woman
have
live
in
the
reign
of
James
the
first
,
her
appearance
alone
would
have
hang
her
,
almost
without
any
evidence
.
  
<EOS>
many
circumstance
likewise
conspire
to
confirm
Partridge
in
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
Her
living
,
as
he
then
imagine
,
by
herself
in
so
lonely
a
place
;
and
in
a
house
,
the
outside
of
which
seem
much
too
good
for
her
,
but
its
inside
be
furnish
in
the
most
neat
and
elegant
manner
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
Jones
himself
be
not
a
little
surprized
at
what
he
see
;
for
,
besides
the
extraordinary
neatness
of
the
room
,
it
be
adorn
with
a
great
number
of
nicknack
and
curiosity
,
which
may
have
engage
the
attention
of
a
virtuoso
.
  
<EOS>
while
Jones
be
admire
these
thing
,
and
Partridge
sit
tremble
with
the
firm
belief
that
he
be
in
the
house
of
a
witch
,
the
old
woman
say
,
"
I
hope
,
gentleman
,
you
will
make
what
haste
you
can
;
for
I
expect
my
master
presently
,
and
I
would
not
for
double
the
money
he
should
find
you
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
have
a
master
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
you
will
excuse
me
,
good
woman
,
but
I
be
surprize
to
see
all
those
fine
thing
in
your
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
sir
,
"
say
she
,
"
if
the
twentieth
part
of
these
thing
be
mine
,
I
should
think
myself
a
rich
woman
.
<EOS>
but
pray
,
sir
,
do
not
stay
much
longer
,
for
I
look
for
him
in
every
minute
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
sure
he
would
not
be
angry
with
you
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
for
do
a
common
act
of
charity
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Alack
-
a
-
day
,
sir
<EOS>
!
"
say
she
,
"
he
be
a
strange
man
,
not
at
all
like
other
people
.
<EOS>
He
keep
no
company
with
anybody
,
and
seldom
walk
out
but
by
night
,
for
he
doth
not
care
to
be
see
;
and
all
the
country
people
be
as
much
afraid
of
meet
him
;
for
his
dress
be
enough
to
frighten
those
who
be
not
use
to
it
.
<EOS>
They
call
him
,
the
Man
of
the
Hill
(
for
there
he
walk
by
night
)
,
and
the
country
people
be
not
,
I
believe
,
more
afraid
of
the
devil
himself
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
terribly
angry
if
he
find
you
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
sir
,
"
say
Partridge
,
"
do
not
let
us
offend
the
gentleman
;
I
be
ready
to
walk
,
and
be
never
warm
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
do
pray
,
sir
,
let
us
go
.
<EOS>
here
be
pistol
over
the
chimney
:
who
know
whether
they
be
charge
or
no
,
or
what
he
may
do
with
them
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
fear
nothing
,
Partridge
,
"
cry
Jones
;
"
I
will
secure
thee
from
danger
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
for
matter
o
'
that
,
he
never
doth
any
mischief
,
"
say
the
woman
;
"
but
to
be
sure
it
be
necessary
he
should
keep
some
arm
for
his
own
safety
;
for
his
house
hath
be
beset
more
than
once
;
and
it
be
not
many
night
ago
that
we
think
we
hear
thief
about
it
:
for
my
own
part
,
I
have
often
wonder
that
he
be
not
murder
by
some
villain
or
other
,
as
he
walk
out
by
himself
at
such
hour
;
but
then
,
as
I
say
,
the
people
be
afraid
of
him
;
and
besides
,
they
think
,
I
suppose
,
he
hath
nothing
about
him
worth
take
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
imagine
,
by
this
collection
of
rarity
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
that
your
master
have
be
a
traveller
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
"
answer
she
,
"
he
hath
be
a
very
great
one
:
there
be
few
gentleman
that
know
more
of
all
matter
than
he
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
he
hath
be
crost
in
love
,
or
whatever
it
be
<EOS>
I
know
not
;
but
I
have
live
with
him
above
these
thirty
year
,
and
in
all
that
time
he
hath
hardly
speak
to
six
live
people
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
then
again
solicit
their
departure
,
in
which
she
be
back
by
Partridge
;
but
Jones
purposely
protract
the
time
,
for
his
curiosity
be
greatly
raise
to
see
this
extraordinary
person
.
<EOS>
though
the
old
woman
,
therefore
,
conclude
every
one
of
her
answer
with
desire
him
to
be
go
,
and
Partridge
proceed
so
far
as
to
pull
him
by
the
sleeve
,
he
still
continue
to
invent
new
question
,
till
the
old
woman
,
with
an
affright
countenance
,
declare
she
hear
her
master
's
signal
;
and
at
the
same
instant
more
than
one
voice
be
hear
without
the
door
,
cry
,
"
D####n
<EOS>
your
blood
,
show
us
your
money
this
instant
.
<EOS>
Your
money
,
you
villain

we
will
blow
your
brain
about
your
ear

<EOS>
"
o
,
good
heaven
!

"
cry
the
old
woman
,
"
some
villain
,
to
be
sure
,
have
attack
my
master

la
!
<EOS>
what

I
do

<EOS>
what
shall
I
do

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Jones
,
"
how
!
 
<EOS>
be
these
pistol
load
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
o
,
good
sir
,
there
be
nothing
in
them
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
o
pray
<EOS>
do
not
murder
us
,
gentleman
!
"
<EOS>
(
for
in
reality
she
now
have
the
same
opinion
of
those
within
as
she
have
of
those
without
)
.
<EOS>
Jones
make
her
no
answer
;
but
snatch
an
old
broad
sword
which
hang
in
the
room
,
he
instantly
sally
out
,
where
he
find
the
old
gentleman
struggle
with
two
ruffian
,
and
beg
for
mercy
.
<EOS>
Jones
ask
no
question
,
but
fall
so
briskly
to
work
with
his
broad
sword
,
that
the
fellow
immediately
quit
their
hold
;
and
without
offer
to
attack
our
heroe
,
betook
themselves
to
their
heel
and
make
their
escape
;
for
he
do
not
attempt
to
pursue
them
,
be
content
with
have
deliver
the
old
gentleman
;
and
indeed
he
conclude
he
have
pretty
well
do
their
business
,
for
both
of
them
,
as
they
run
off
,
cry
out
with
bitter
oath
that
they
be
dead
man

<EOS>
Jones
presently
run
to
lift
up
the
old
gentleman
,
who
have
be
throw
down
in
the
scuffle
,
express
at
the
same
time
great
concern
lest
he
should
have
receive
any
harm
from
the
villain
.
<EOS>
the
old
man
stare
a
moment
at
Jones
,
and
then
cry
,
"
no
,
sir
,
no
,
<EOS>
I
have
very
little
harm
,
I
thank
you
.
<EOS>
Lord
have
mercy
upon
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
,
sir

"
say
Jones
,
"
you
be
not
free
from
apprehension
even
of
those
who
have
have
the
happiness
to
be
your
deliverer

can
I
blame
any
suspicion
which
you
may
have
;

indeed
you
have
no
real
occasion
for
any
<EOS>
;
here
be
none
but
your
friend
present

<EOS>
have
mist
our
way
this
cold
night

take
the
liberty
of
warm
ourselves
at
your
fire

whence
we
be
just

I
must

so

with
the
blood

stedfastly
at
Jones
during
some
moment

then
with
a
sigh
cry
out
,
"
You
will
pardon
me

<EOS>

be
thankful

Jones

"
to
that
Providence

you

only
discharge

"
You

a
human
creature
then
?
<EOS>
well
,
perhaps
you
be
.
<EOS>
come
pray
walk
into
my
little
hutt

You

<EOS>
the
old
woman
be
distract
between
the
fear
which
she
have
of
her
master

for
him
;

Partridge
be
,
if
possible

in
a
great
fright

the
former
of
these
,
however
,
when
she
hear
her
master
speak
kindly
to
Jones
,
and
perceive
what
have
happen
,
come
again
to
herself
;
but
Partridge
no
sooner
see
the
gentleman
,
than
the
strangeness
of
his
dress
infuse
great
terror
into
that
poor
fellow
than
he
have
before
feel
,
either
from
the
strange
description
which
he
have
hear
,
or
from
the
uproar
which
have
happen
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
it
be
an
appearance
which
may
have
affect
a
more
constant
mind
than
that
of
Mr
Partridge
.
<EOS>
this
person
be
of
the
tall
size
,
with
a
long
beard
as
white
as
snow

<EOS>
His
body
be
cloathe
with
the
skin
of
an
ass
,
make
something
into
the
form
of
a
coat

He
wear
likewise
boot
on
his
leg

and
a
cap
on
his
head

both
compose
of
the
skin
of
some
other
animal

<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
old

come
into
his
house
,
the
old
woman
begin
her
congratulation
on
his
happy
escape
from
the
ruffian

<EOS>
"
yes

he
,
"
I
have
escape

indeed

he
be
a
good
gentleman

I
warrant
him

<EOS>
I
be
afraid
your
worship
would
have
be
angry
with
me
for
let
him
in
;

to
be
certain
<EOS>
I
should
not

have
not
I
see
by
the
moon

light

that
he
be
a
gentleman

almost
freeze
to
death

to
be
certain
it
must
have
be
some
good
angel

send
him
hither

tempt
me
to
do
it

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
,
sir

say
the
old
gentleman
to
Jones

that
I
have
nothing
in
this
house

you

Jones
decline
this
offer

civil

Whither

Jones

I
can
not
censure
a
passion

I
feel
at

You
will
pardon
me
when
I
assure
you
,
that
everything
which
I
have
see
or
hear
since
I
first
enter
this

conspire
to
raise
the
great
curiosity

something
very
extraordinary

reason

misfortune

<EOS>
here
the
old
gentleman
again
sigh
,

remain
silent
for
some
minute

at
last
,
look
earnestly
on
Jones

he
say
,

I
have
read

you

I
must
be
the

<EOS>
Jones
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation

answer
,

that
it

in
his

gratify
him
extremely

a

you
suffer

myself
at

refuse
you
anything
after
what
hath
happen

the
old
man

<EOS>
"
if
you
desire
therefore
to
hear
the
story
of
an
unhappy
man

I
will
relate
it
to
you

<EOS>
indeed
you
judge
rightly
,
in
think
there
be
commonly
something
extraordinary
in
the
fortune
of
those
who
fly
from
society

for
however
it
may
seem
a
paradox

or
even
a
contradiction

<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
that
great
philanthropy
chiefly
incline
us
to
avoid
and
detest
mankind
;
not
on
account
so
much
of
their
private
and
selfish
vice
,
but
for
those
of
a
relative
kind
;
such
as
envy
,
malice
,
treachery
,
cruelty
,
with
every
other
specie
of
malevolence

<EOS>
these
be
the
vice
which
true
philanthropy
abhor
,

rather

see
and
converse
with

avoid
society
itself

however
,
without
a
compliment
to
you

you
do
not
appear
to
me
one
of
those

I
should
shun
or
det
;
nay
,
I
must
say
,
in
what
little
hath
dropt
from
you
,
there
appear
some
parity
in
our
fortune

I
hope

however

yours
will
conclude
more
successfully

<EOS>
here
some
compliment
pass
between
our
heroe

his
host

then
the
latter
be
go
to
begin
his
history

Partridge
interrupt
him

His
apprehension
have
now
pretty
well
leave
him

some
effect

his
terror
remain

excellent

though
this
circumstance
perhaps
make

miserable

not

him
poor

he
confine
her
almost
entirely
at
home

rather
choose
to
bear
eternal
upbraiding

chid
the

proceed

"
My

now
,
at
the
age
of
fifteen
,
bade
adieu
to
all
learning

and
to
everything
else
but
to
his
dog
and
gun
;
with
which
latter
he
become
so
expert
,
that
,
though
perhaps
you
may
think
it
incredible

he
could
not

hit
a
standing

harder

at
school

I
soon
change
my
opinion

for
as
I
advance
pretty
fast
in
learning

my
labour
become
easy

and
my
exercise
so
delightful

that
holiday

my
most
unpleasant

for
my

who
never
love

now
apprehend
that
I
have
the
great
share
of
my

affection

thinking

that
I

off

"
there
be
at
the
same
college
with
myself
one
Sir
George
Gresham
,
a
young
fellow
who
be
intitle
to
a
very
considerable
fortune

which

be
not

by
the
will
of
his

into
full
possession
of
till
he
arrive
at
the
age
of
twenty

five

<EOS>
however
,
the
liberality
of
his
guardian
give
him
little
cause
to
regret
the
abundant
caution
of
his
father
;
for
they
allow
him
five
hundred
pound
a
year
while
he
remain
at
the
university
,
where
he
keep
his
horse
and
his
whore

live
as
wicked
and
as
profligate
a
life
as
he
could
have
do
have
he
be
never
so
entirely
master
of
his
fortune

for
besides
the
five
hundred
a
year
which
he
receive
from
his

he
find
mean
to
spend
a
thousand
more

above
the
age

twenty

have
no

gain
what
credit
he

"
this
young
fellow

among
many
other
tolerable
bad
quality

have
one
very
diabolical

<EOS>
He
have
a
great
delight
in
destroy

ruin
the
youth
of
inferior
fortune

draw
them
into
expense

<EOS>
"
It
be
my
misfortune
to
fall
into
an
acquaintance
and
intimacy
with
this
gentleman

<EOS>
My
reputation
of
diligence
in
my
study
make
me
a
desirable
object
of
his
mischievous
intention

and
my
own
inclination
make
it
sufficiently
easy
for
him
to
effect
his
purpose

for
though
I
have
apply
myself
with
much
industry
to
book
,
in
which
I
take
great
delight
,
there
be
other
pleasure
in
which
I
be
capable
of
take
much
great
;
for
I
be
high
-
mettled
,
have
a
violent
flow
of
animal
spirit
,
be
a
little
ambitious
,
and
extremely
amorous

<EOS>
"
I
have
not
long
contract
an
intimacy
with
Sir
George
before
I
become
a
partaker
of
all
his
pleasure
;
and
when
I
be
once
enter
on
that
scene
,
neither
my
inclination
nor
my
spirit
would
suffer
me
to
play
an
under
part
.
<EOS>
I
be
second
to
none
of
the
company
in
any
act
of
debauchery
;
nay
,
I
soon
distinguish
myself
so
notably
in
all
riot
and
disorder
,
that
my
name
generally
stand
first
in
the
roll
of
delinquent
;
and
instead
of
be
lament
as
the
unfortunate
pupil
of
Sir
George
,
I
be
now
accuse
as
the
person
who
have
mislead
and
debauch
that
hopeful
young
gentleman
;
for
though
he
be
the
ringleader
and
promoter
of
all
the
mischief

he
be
never
so
consider
.
<EOS>
I
fall
at
last
under
the
censure
of
the
vice
-
chancellor

and
very
narrowly
escape
expulsion
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
easily
believe
,
sir
,
that
such
a
life
as
I
be
now
describe
must
be
incompatible
with
my
further
progress
in
learning
;
and
that
in
proportion
as
I
addict
myself
more
and
more
to
loose
pleasure
,
I
must
grow
more
and
more
remiss
in
application
to
my
study

<EOS>
this
be
truly
the
consequence
;
but
this
be
not
all

<EOS>
My
expense
now
greatly
exceed
not
only
my
former
income

those
addition
which
I
extort
from
my
poor
generous
father

on
pretence
of
sum
be
necessary
for
prepare
for
my
approach
degree
of
batchelor
of
art

<EOS>
these
demand
,
however
,
grow
at
last
so
frequent
and
exorbitant
,
that
my
father
by
slow
degree
open
his
ear
to
the
account
which
he
receive
from
many
quarter
of
my
present
behaviour
,
and
which
my
mother
fail
not
to
echo
very
faithfully
and
loudly
;
add
,
"
ay

this
be
the
fine

the
scholar

doth
so
much
honour

to
be
the
making

come
to

He
be
to

would
come
to

with
much
more
of
the

kind

I
have
,
I
believe
,
satisfy
you
with
this
taste

My
father
,
therefore
,
begin
now
to
return
remonstrance
instead
of
money
to
my
demand
,
which
bring
my
affair
perhaps
a
little
sooner
to
a
crisis
;
but
have
he
remit
me
his
whole
income

you
will
imagine
it
could
have
suffice
a
very
short
time
to
support
one
who
keep
pace
with
the
expense
of
Sir
George
Gresham

It
be
more
than
possible
that
the
distress
I
be
now
in
for
money
,

the
impracticability
of
go
on
in
this
manner
,
may
have
restore
me
at
once
to
my
sense

to
my
study

have
I
open
my
eye
before
I
become
involved
in
debt
from
which
I
see
no
hope
of
ever
extricate
myself

<EOS>
this
be
indeed
the
great
art
of
Sir
George
,
and
by
which
he
accomplish
the
ruin
of
many
,
whom
he
afterwards
laugh
at
as
fool

coxcomb

he
call
it

though
he
have
no
very
large
allowance
,
have
by
his
parsimony
heap
up
upwards
of
forty
guinea
,
which
I
know
he
keep
in
his
escritore
.
<EOS>
I
take
therefore
an
opportunity
of
purloin
his
key
from
his
breech
-
pocket
,
while
he
be
asleep
,
and
thus
make
myself
master
of
all
his
rich
:
after
which
I
again
convey
his
key
into
his
pocket
,
and
counterfeit
sleep
 
though
I
never
once
close
my
eye
,
lie
in
bed
till
after
he
arise
and
go
to
prayer
 
an
exercise
to
which
I
have
long
be
unaccustomed
.
  
<EOS>
"
timorous
thief
,
by
extreme
caution
,
often
subject
themselves
to
discovery
,
which
those
of
a
bold
kind
escape
.
<EOS>
thus
it
happen
to
me
;
for
have
I
boldly
break
open
his
escritore
,
I
have
,
perhaps
,
escape
even
his
suspicion
;
but
as
it
be
plain
that
the
person
who
rob
him
have
possess
himself
of
his
key
,
he
have
no
doubt
,
when
he
first
miss
his
money
,
but
that
his
chum
be
certainly
the
thief
.
<EOS>
now
as
he
be
of
a
fearful
disposition
,
and
much
my
inferior
in
strength
,
and
I
believe
in
courage
,
he
do
not
dare
to
confront
me
with
my
guilt
,
for
fear
of
bad
bodily
consequence
which
may
happen
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
repair
therefore
immediately
to
the
vice
-
chancellor
,
and
upon
swear
to
the
robbery
,
and
to
the
circumstance
of
it
,
very
easily
obtain
a
warrant
against
one
who
have
now
so
bad
a
character
through
the
whole
university
.
  
<EOS>
"
luckily
for
me
,
I
lie
out
of
the
college
the
next
evening
;
for
that
day
I
attend
a
young
lady
in
a
chaise
to
Witney
,
where
we
staid
all
night
,
and
in
our
return
,
the
next
morning
,
to
Oxford
,
I
meet
one
of
my
crony
,
who
acquaint
me
with
sufficient
news
concern
myself
to
make
me
turn
my
horse
another
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Pray
,
sir
,
do
he
mention
anything
of
the
warrant
?
"
say
Partridge
.
<EOS>
but
Jones
beg
the
gentleman
to
proceed
without
regard
any
impertinent
question
;
which
he
do
as
follow
:
    
"
have
now
abandon
all
thought
of
return
to
Oxford
,
the
next
thing
which
offer
itself
be
a
journey
to
London
.
<EOS>
I
impart
this
intention
to
my
female
companion
,
who
at
first
remonstrate
against
it
;
but
upon
produce
my
wealth
,
she
immediately
consent
.
<EOS>
We
then
strike
across
the
country
,
into
the
great
Cirencester
road
,
and
make
such
haste
,
that
we
spend
the
next
evening
,
save
one
,
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
you
consider
the
place
where
I
now
be
,
and
the
company
with
whom
I
be
,
you
will
,
I
fancy
,
conceive
that
a
very
short
time
bring
me
to
an
end
of
that
sum
of
which
I
have
so
iniquitously
possess
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
now
reduce
to
a
much
high
degree
of
distress
than
before
:
the
necessary
of
life
begin
to
be
number
among
my
want
;
and
what
make
my
case
still
the
more
grievous
be
,
that
my
paramour
,
of
whom
I
be
now
grow
immoderately
fond
,
share
the
same
distress
with
myself
.
<EOS>
to
see
a
woman
you
love
in
distress
;
to
be
unable
to
relieve
her
,
and
at
the
same
time
to
reflect
that
you
have
bring
her
into
this
situation
,
be
perhaps
a
curse
of
which
no
imagination
can
represent
the
horror
to
those
who
have
not
feel
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
from
my
soul
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
and
I
pity
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
:
"
<EOS>
he
then
take
two
or
three
disorderly
turn
about
the
room
,
and
at
last
begged
pardon
,
and
fling
himself
into
his
chair
,
cry
,
"
I
thank
Heaven
,
I
have
escape
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
circumstance
,
"
continue
the
gentleman
,
"
so
severely
aggravate
the
horror
of
my
present
situation
,
that
they
become
absolutely
intolerable
.
<EOS>
I
could
with
less
pain
endure
the
raging
in
my
own
natural
unsatisfied
appetite
,
even
hunger
or
thirst
,
than
I
could
submit
to
leave
ungratified
the
most
whimsical
desire
of
a
woman
on
whom
I
so
extravagantly
doate
,
that
,
though
I
know
she
have
be
the
mistress
of
half
my
acquaintance
,
I
firmly
intend
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
but
the
good
creature
be
unwilling
to
consent
to
an
action
which
the
world
may
think
so
much
to
my
disadvantage
.
<EOS>
and
as
,
possibly
,
she
compassionate
the
daily
anxiety
which
she
must
have
perceive
me
suffer
on
her
account
,
she
resolve
to
put
an
end
to
my
distress
.
<EOS>
She
soon
,
indeed
,
find
mean
to
relieve
me
from
my
troublesome
and
perplex
situation
;
for
while
I
be
distract
with
various
invention
to
supply
her
with
pleasure
,
she
very
kindly
 
betray
me
to
one
of
her
former
lover
at
Oxford
,
by
whose
care
and
diligence
<EOS>
I
be
immediately
apprehend
and
commit
to
gaol
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
I
first
begin
seriously
to
reflect
on
the
miscarriage
of
my
former
life
;
on
the
error
I
have
be
guilty
of
;
on
the
misfortune
which
I
have
bring
on
myself
;
and
on
the
grief
which
I
must
have
occasion
to
one
of
the
good
of
father
.
<EOS>
when
I
add
to
all
these
the
perfidy
of
my
mistress
,
such
be
the
horror
of
my
mind
,
that
life
,
instead
of
be
longer
desirable
,
grow
the
object
of
my
abhorrence
;
and
I
could
have
gladly
embrace
death
as
my
dear
friend
,
if
it
have
offer
itself
to
my
choice
unattende
by
shame
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
time
of
the
assize
soon
come
,
and
I
be
remove
by
habea
corpus
to
Oxford
,
where
I
expect
certain
conviction
and
condemnation
;
but
,
to
my
great
surprize
,
none
appear
against
me
,
and
I
be
,
at
the
end
of
the
session
,
discharge
for
want
of
prosecution
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
my
chum
have
leave
Oxford
,
and
whether
from
indolence
,
or
from
what
other
motive
I
be
ignorant
,
have
decline
concern
himself
any
farther
in
the
affair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
"
cry
Partridge
,
"
he
do
not
care
to
have
your
blood
upon
his
hand
;
and
he
be
in
the
right
on't
.
<EOS>
if
any
person
be
to
be
hang
upon
my
evidence
,
I
should
never
be
able
to
lie
alone
afterwards
,
for
fear
of
see
his
ghost
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
shortly
doubt
,
Partridge
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
whether
thou
art
more
brave
or
wise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
laugh
at
me
,
sir
,
if
you
please
,
"
answer
Partridge
;
"
but
if
you
will
hear
a
very
short
story
which
I
can
tell
,
and
which
be
most
certainly
true
,
perhaps
you
may
change
your
opinion
.
<EOS>
in
the
parish
where
I
be
bear
"
here
Jones
would
have
silence
him
;
but
the
stranger
intercede
that
he
may
be
permit
to
tell
his
story
,
and
in
the
meantime
promise
to
recollect
the
remainder
of
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
Partridge
then
proceed
thus
:
"
in
the
parish
where
I
be
bear
,
there
live
a
farmer
whose
name
be
Bridle
,
and
he
have
a
son
name
Francis
,
a
good
hopeful
young
fellow
:
<EOS>
I
be
at
the
grammar
-
school
with
him
,
where
I
remember
he
be
get
into
Ovid
's
epistle
,
and
he
could
construe
you
three
line
together
sometimes
without
look
into
a
dictionary
.
<EOS>
besides
all
this
,
he
be
a
very
good
lad
,
never
miss
church
o
'
Sundays
,
and
be
reckon
one
of
the
good
psalm
-
singer
in
the
whole
parish
.
<EOS>
He
would
indeed
now
and
then
take
a
cup
too
much
,
and
that
be
the
only
fault
he
have
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
but
come
to
the
ghost
,
"
cry
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
never
fear
,
sir
;
I
shall
come
to
him
soon
enough
,
"
answer
Partridge
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
,
then
,
that
farmer
Bridle
lose
a
mare
,
a
sorrel
one
,
to
the
good
of
my
remembrance
;
and
so
it
fall
out
that
this
young
Francis
shortly
afterward
be
at
a
fair
at
Hindon
,
and
as
I
think
it
be
on
,
I
can
not
remember
the
day
;
and
be
as
he
be
,
what
should
he
happen
to
meet
but
a
man
upon
his
father
's
mare
.
<EOS>
Frank
call
out
presently
,
stop
thief
;
and
it
be
in
the
middle
of
the
fair
,
it
be
impossible
,
you
know
,
for
the
man
to
make
his
escape
.
<EOS>
so
they
apprehend
him
and
carry
him
before
the
justice
<EOS>
:
I
remember
it
be
Justice
Willoughby
,
of
Noyle
,
a
very
worthy
good
gentleman
;
and
he
commit
him
to
prison
,
and
bind
Frank
in
a
recognisance
,
I
think
they
call
it
 
a
hard
word
compound
of
re
and
cognosco
;
but
it
differ
in
its
meaning
from
the
use
of
the
simple
,
as
many
other
compound
do
.
<EOS>
well
,
at
last
down
come
my
Lord
Justice
Page
to
hold
the
assize
;
and
so
the
fellow
be
have
up
,
and
Frank
be
have
up
for
a
witness
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
I
shall
never
forget
the
face
of
the
judge
,
when
he
begin
to
ask
him
what
he
have
to
say
against
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
He
make
poor
Frank
tremble
and
shake
in
his
shoe
.
<EOS>
"
well
you
,
fellow
,
"
say
my
lord
,
"
what
have
you
to
say
?
<EOS>
do
not
stand
humming
and
hawing
,
but
speak
out
.
"
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
he
soon
turn
altogether
as
civil
to
Frank
,
and
begin
to
thunder
at
the
fellow
;
and
when
he
ask
him
if
he
have
anything
to
say
for
himself
,
the
fellow
say
,
he
have
find
the
horse
.
"
<EOS>
ay
!
<EOS>
"
answer
the
judge
,
"
thou
art
a
lucky
fellow
:
I
have
travel
the
circuit
these
forty
year
,
and
never
find
a
horse
in
my
life
:
but
I
will
tell
thee
<EOS>
what
,
friend
,
thou
wast
more
lucky
than
thou
didst
know
of
;
for
thou
didst
not
only
find
a
horse
,
but
a
halter
too
<EOS>
,
I
promise
thee
.
"
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
I
shall
never
forget
the
word
.
<EOS>
upon
which
everybody
fall
a
laughing
,
as
how
could
they
help
it
?
<EOS>
nay
,
and
twenty
other
jest
he
make
,
which
I
can
not
remember
now
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
about
his
skill
in
horse
-
flesh
which
make
all
the
folk
laugh
.
<EOS>
to
be
certain
,
the
judge
must
have
be
a
very
brave
man
,
as
well
as
a
man
of
much
learning
.
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
charming
sport
to
hear
trial
upon
life
and
death
.
<EOS>
one
thing
I
own
<EOS>
I
think
a
little
hard
,
that
the
prisoner
's
counsel
be
not
suffer
to
speak
for
him
,
though
he
desire
only
to
be
hear
one
very
short
word
,
but
my
lord
would
not
hearken
to
him
,
though
he
suffer
a
counsellor
to
talk
against
him
for
above
half
-
an
-
hour
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
hard
,
I
own
,
that
there
should
be
so
many
of
them
;
my
lord
,
and
the
court
,
and
the
jury
,
and
the
counsellor
,
and
the
witness
,
all
upon
one
poor
man
,
and
he
too
in
chain
.
<EOS>
well
,
the
fellow
be
hang
,
as
to
be
sure
it
could
be
no
otherwise
,
and
poor
Frank
could
never
be
easy
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
never
be
in
the
dark
alone
,
but
he
fancy
he
see
the
fellow
's
spirit
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
and
be
this
thy
story
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
"
answer
Partridge
.
<EOS>
"
o
Lord
have
mercy
upon
me
!
<EOS>
I
be
just
now
come
to
the
matter
;
for
one
night
,
come
from
the
alehouse
,
in
a
long
,
narrow
,
dark
lane
,
there
he
run
directly
up
against
him
;
and
the
spirit
be
all
in
white
,
and
fall
upon
Frank
;
and
Frank
,
who
be
a
sturdy
lad
,
fall
upon
the
spirit
again
,
and
there
they
have
a
tussel
together
,
and
poor
Frank
be
dreadfully
beat
:
indeed
he
make
a
shift
at
last
to
crawl
home
;
but
what
with
the
beating
,
and
what
with
the
fright
,
he
lie
ill
above
a
fortnight
;
and
all
this
be
most
certainly
true
,
and
the
whole
parish
will
bear
witness
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
stranger
smile
at
this
story
,
and
Jones
burst
into
a
loud
fit
of
laughter
;
upon
which
Partridge
cry
,
"
ay
,
you
may
laugh
,
sir
;
and
so
do
some
other
,
particularly
a
squire
,
who
be
think
to
be
no
well
than
an
atheist
;
who
,
forsooth
,
because
there
be
a
calf
with
a
white
face
find
dead
in
the
same
lane
the
next
morning
,
would
fain
have
it
that
the
battle
be
between
Frank
and
that
,
as
if
a
calf
would
set
upon
a
man
.
<EOS>
besides
,
Frank
tell
me
he
know
it
to
be
a
spirit
,
and
could
swear
to
him
in
any
court
in
Christendom
;
and
he
have
not
drink
above
a
quart
or
two
or
such
a
matter
of
liquor
,
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
Lud
have
mercy
upon
us
,
and
keep
us
all
from
dip
our
hand
in
blood
,
I
say
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
"
say
Jones
to
the
stranger
,
"
Mr
Partridge
hath
finish
his
story
,
and
I
hope
will
give
you
no
future
interruption
,
if
you
will
be
so
kind
to
proceed
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
resume
his
narration
;
but
as
he
hath
take
breath
for
a
while
,
we
think
proper
to
give
it
to
our
reader
,
and
shall
therefore
put
an
end
to
this
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
the
Man
of
the
Hill
continue
his
history
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
now
regain
my
liberty
,
"
say
the
stranger
;
<EOS>
"
but
I
have
lose
my
reputation
;
for
there
be
a
wide
difference
between
the
case
of
a
man
who
be
barely
acquit
of
a
crime
in
a
court
of
justice
,
and
of
him
who
be
acquit
in
his
own
heart

and
in
the
opinion
of
the
people

<EOS>
I
be
conscious
of
my
guilt

ashamed
to
look
any
one
in
the
face
;
so
resolve
to
leave
Oxford
the
next
morning
,
before
the
daylight
discover
me
to
the
eye
of
any
beholder
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
I
have
get
clear
of
the
city
,
it
first
enter
into
my
head
to
return
home
to
my
father
,
and
endeavour
to
obtain
his
forgiveness
;
but
as
I
have
no
reason
to
doubt
his
knowledge
of
all
which
have
past
,
and
as
I
be
well
assure
of
his
great
aversion
to
all
act
of
dishonesty
,
I
could
entertain
no
hope
of
be
receive
by
him
,
especially
since
I
be
too
certain
of
all
the
good
office
in
the
power
of
my
mother
;
<EOS>
nay
,
have
my
father
's
pardon
be
as
sure
,
as
I
conceive
his
resentment
to
be
,
I
yet
question
whether
I
could
have
have
the
assurance
to
behold
him
,
or
whether
I
could
,
upon
any
term
,
have
submit
to
live
and
converse
with
those
who
,
I
be
convince
,
know
me
to
have
be
guilty
of
so
base
an
action
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hasten
therefore
back
to
London
,
the
good
retirement
of
either
grief
or
shame
,
unless
for
person
of
a
very
public
character
;
for
here
you
have
the
advantage
of
solitude
without
its
disadvantage
,
since
you
may
be
alone
and
in
company
at
the
same
time
;
and
while
you
walk
or
sit
unobserved
,
noise
,
hurry
,
and
a
constant
succession
of
object
,
entertain
the
mind
,
and
prevent
the
spirit
from
prey
on
themselves
,
or
rather
on
grief
or
shame
,
which
be
the
most
unwholesome
diet
in
the
world
;
and
on
which
(
though
there
be
many
who
never
taste
either
but
in
public
)
<EOS>
there
be
some
who
can
feed
very
plentifully
and
very
fatally
when
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
as
there
be
scarce
any
human
good
without
its
concomitant
evil
,
so
there
be
people
who
find
an
inconvenience
in
this
unobserve
temper
of
mankind
;
I
mean
person
who
have
no
money
;
for
as
you
be
not
put
out
of
countenance
,
so
neither
be
you
cloathed
or
feed
by
those
who
do
not
know
you
.
<EOS>
and
a
man
may
be
as
easily
starve
in
leadenhall
-
market
as
in
the
desert
of
Arabia
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
at
present
my
fortune
to
be
destitute
of
that
great
evil
,

it
be

several

well

"
continue
the
stranger
,
"
whether
it
be
an
evil
,
or
only
the
cause
of
evil
,
I
be
entirely
void
of
it
,
and
at
the
same
time
of
friend
,
and
,
as
I
think
,
of
acquaintance
;
when
one
evening
,
as
I
be
pass
through
the
Inner
Temple
,
very
hungry
,
and
very
miserable
,
I
hear
a
voice
on
a
sudden
hailing
me
with
great
familiarity
by
my
christian
name
;
and
upon
turn
about
,
I
presently
recollect
the
person
who
so
salute
me
to
have
be
my
fellow
-
collegiate
;
one
who
have
leave
the
university
above
a
year
,
and
long
before
any
of
my
misfortune
have
befall
me
.
<EOS>
this
gentleman
,
whose
name
be
Watson
,
shake
me
heartily
by
the
hand
;
and
express
great
joy
at
meet
me
,
propose
our
immediately
drink
a
bottle
together
.
<EOS>
I
first
decline
the
proposal
,
and
pretend
business
,
but
as
he
be
very
earnest
and
pressing
,
hunger
at
last
overcame
my
pride
,
and
I
fairly
confess
to
him
I
have
no
money
in
my
pocket
;
yet
not
without
frame
a
lie
for
an
excuse
,
and
impute
it
to
my
have
change
my
breech
that
morning
.
<EOS>
Mr
Watson
answer
,
"
I
think
,
Jack
,
you
and
I
have
be
too
old
acquaintance
for
you
to
mention
such
a
matter

"
<EOS>
He
then
take
me
by
the
arm
,
and
be
pull
me
along
;
but
I
give
him
very
little
trouble
,
for
my
own
inclination
pull
me
much
strong
than
he
could
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
then
go
into
the
Friars
,
which
you
know
be
the
scene
of
all
mirth
and
jollity
.
<EOS>
here
,
when
we
arrive
at
the
tavern
,
Mr
Watson
apply
himself
to
the
drawer
only
,
without
take
the
least
notice
of
the
cook
;
for
he
have
no
suspicion
but
that
I
have
dine
long
since
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
the
case
be
really
otherwise
,
I
forge
another
falsehood
,
and
tell
my
companion
<EOS>
I
have
be
at
the
further
end
of
the
city
on
business
of
consequence
,
and
have
snapt
up
a
mutton
-
chop
in
haste
;
so
that
I
be
again
hungry
,
and
wish
he
would
add
a
beef
-
steak
to
his
bottle
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
some
people
,
"
cry
Partridge
,
"
ought
to
have
good
memory

you

<EOS>
"
Your
observation

answer
the

I
believe
such
blunder
be
inseparable
from
all
deal
in
untruth

<EOS>
but
to
proceed
 
I
begin
now
to
feel
myself
extremely
happy

<EOS>
the
meat
and
wine
soon
revive
my
spirit
to
a
high
pitch
,
and
I
enjoy
much
pleasure
in
the
conversation
of
my
old
acquaintance
,
the
rather
as
I
think
him
entirely
ignorant
of
what
have
happen
at
the
university
since
his
leave
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
he
do
not
suffer
me
to
remain
long
in
this
agreeable
delusion
;
for
take
a
bumper
in
one
hand
,

hold
me
by
the
other

<EOS>
here

here
be
wish
you
joy
of
your

honourably
acquitted

affair
lay
to
your
charge

<EOS>
"
I
be
thunderstruck
with
confusion
at
those
word
,
which
Watson
observe
,
proceed
thus
:
"
Nay
,
never
be
ashamed

man
;
thou
hast
be
acquit
,
and
no
one
now
dare
call
thee
guilty
;
but
,
prithee
,
do
tell
me
,
who
be
thy
friend
 
<EOS>
I
hope
thou
didst
really
rob
him
?
<EOS>
for
rat
me
if
it
be
not
a
meritorious
action
to
strip
such
a
sneak
,
pitiful
rascal
;
and
instead
of
the
two
hundred
guinea
,
I
wish
you
have
take
as
many
thousand
.
<EOS>
come
,
come
,
<EOS>
my
boy
,
do
not
be
shy
of
confess
to
me
:
you
be
not
now
bring
before
one
of
the
pimp
.
<EOS>
D####n
me
<EOS>
if
I
do
not
honour
you
for
it

for
,
as
I
hope
for
salvation
,
I
would
have
make
no
manner
of
scruple
of
do
the
same
thing

<EOS>
"
  
"
this
declaration
a
little
relieved
my
abashment
;
and
as
wine
have
now
somewhat
open
my
heart
,
I
very
freely
acknowledge
the
robbery
,
but
acquaint
him
that
he
have
be
misinform
as
to
the
sum
take
,
which
be
little
more
than
a
fifth
part

what
he
have
mention

I
be
sorry
for
it
with
all

I

thee
well
success
another

if
you
will
take
my
advice

you
shall
have
no
occasion
to
run
any
such
risque

<EOS>
follow

my
counsel

I
will
show
you
a
way
to
empty
the
pocket
of
a
queer
cull
without
any
danger

the
nubbe

Partridge
:

<EOS>
"
why

be
a

not

for
as
gamester
differ
little
from

We
have
now
each
drink
our
bottle
,
when
Mr

board

that

must
attend

earnestly

inform
him

the
emptiness

<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
I
doubt
not
from
his
many
strong
expression
of
friendship
,
but
that
he
would
offer
to
lend
me
a
small
sum
for
that
purpose

he
answer
,
"
never

circumspect
as
to
the
man

I
will
tip
you
the
proper
person

which
may
be
necessary

I
express
some
dislike
at
this

hint
my

would
have
deposit
the
whole

down

up

him

such
haste
into

I
hear
nothing

disappointment

mention
a

Mr

to
my
surprize

pull
out
a
large
sum
of
money

place
it
before
him

over

moment
poor

the
poor

suddenly

rich

so
well
instructed
his
pupil

the
contempt

after
much
variety

luck

rise
from
the
table
in
some
heat

declare

have
lose
a

hundred

no

then
come
up
to
me

ask
me
to
return
with
him
to
the
tavern

I
positively
refuse

,
I
would
not
bring
myself
a
second

such
a

have
lose
all

a
couple
of
guinea

He
immediately
put
one

no

shocked

so
unhandsome
a

tell
us

forget
to

I
become
perfectly
easy

very
readily
give
him
a
guinea
,
bid
him
pay
himself
,

acquiesce
in
the
unjust
charge

Mr
Watson
now
bespoke
the
most
extravagant
supper
he
could
well
think
of
;
and
though
he
have
content
himself
with
simple
claret
before

nothing
now

the
most
precious
Burgundy
would
serve
his
purpose

Our
company
be
soon
encrease
by
the
addition
of
several
gentleman
from
the
gaming

table

most
of
whom
,
as
I
afterwards
find
,
come
not
to
the
tavern
to
drink
,

in
the
way
of
business

the
true

pretend
to
be
ill

refuse
their
glass

they
ply
heartily
two
young
fellow

pillage

My

acquaint
with
the
whole

sharper

be
let
into
their
secret
;
I
mean
,
into
the
knowledge
of
those
gross
cheat
which
be
proper
to
impose
upon
the
raw

unexperienced
;
for
there
be
some
trick
of
a
fine
kind
,
which
be
know
only
to
a
few
of
the
gang
,
who
be
at
the
head
of
their
profession

a
degree
of
honour
beyond
my
expectation
;
for

to
which
I
be
immoderately
addict
,
and
the
natural
warmth
of
my
passion

prevent
me
from

at
any
great
success
in
an
art

much
coolness

Mr

with
whom
I
now
live
in

close
amity

have
unluckily
the
former
failing
to
a
very
great
excess
;
so
that
instead
of
make
a
fortune
by
his
profession
,
as
some
other
do
,
he
be
alternately
rich
and
poor
,
and
be
often
oblige
to
surrender
to
his
cool
friend

over
a
bottle
which
they
never
taste

that
plunder
that
he

take
from
cull
at
the
public
table

<EOS>
"
however
,
we
both
make
a
shift
to
pick
up
an
uncomfortable
livelihood
;

for
two
year
I
continue
of
the
calling
;
during
which
time
I
taste
all
the
variety
of
fortune

sometimes
flourish
in
affluence

at
other

struggle
with
almost
incredible

My
fine

one
night

pennyless

I
observe
a
very
great
disturbance

a
large
mob
gather
together
in
the
street

<EOS>
as
I
be
in
no

from
pickpocket

I
venture
into
the
croud

where
upon
enquiry
I
find
that
a
man
have
be
rob
and
very
ill
use
by
some
ruffian
.
<EOS>
the
wounded
man
appear
very
bloody
,

seem
scarce
able

support
himself
on
his
leg

I
have
not
therefore
be
deprive
of
my
humanity
by
my
present
life
and
conversation
,
though
they
have
leave
me
very
little
of
either
honesty
or
shame
,
I
immediately
offer
my
assistance
to
the
unhappy
person
,
who
thankfully
accept
it
,
and
,
put
himself
under
my
conduct
,
beg
me
to
convey
him
to
some
tavern
,
where
he
may
send
for
a
surgeon
,
be
,
as
he
say
,
faint
with
loss
of
blood

<EOS>
He
seem
indeed
highly
pleased
at
find
one

appear
in
the
dress

all

I
take
the
poor
man
by
the
arm

lead
him
to
the
tavern

we
keep
our
rendezvous

I

the
pleasure

very

this
surgeon

ready
to
do
any

He
offer
his
patient
the
use

his
chariot

carry
him
to
his
inn

at
the

time
whisper
in

back

cry
,

away

<EOS>
"
many
of
the
people
present
imagine
this
accident
have
happen
through
his
loss
of
blood
;
but
I
,
who
at
the
same
time
begin
to
recollect
the
feature
of
my
father

be
now
confirm
in
my
suspicion

and
satisfy
that
it
be
he
himself
who
appear
before
me

<EOS>
I
presently
run
to
him
,
raise
him
in
my
arm
,
and
kiss
his
cold
lip
with
the
utmost
eagerness
.
<EOS>
here
I
must
draw
a
curtain
over
a
scene
which
I
can
not
describe
;
for
though
I
do
not
lose
my
being
,
as
my
father
for
a
while
<EOS>
do
,
my
sense
be
however
so
overpowered
with
affright
and
surprize
,
that
I
be
a
stranger
to
what
pass
during
some
minute
,
and
indeed
till
my
father
have
again
recover
from
his
swoon
,
and
I
find
myself
in
his
arm
,
both
tenderly
embrace
each
other
,
while
the
tear
trickle
a
-
pace
down
the
cheek
of
each
of
us

<EOS>
"
Most
of
those
present
seem
affected
by
this
scene
,
which
we
,
who
may
be
consider
as
the
actor
in
it
,
be
desirous
of
remove
from
the
eye
of
all
spectator
as
fast
as
we
could
;
my
father
therefore
accept
the
kind
offer
of
the
surgeon
's
chariot
,
and
I
attend
him
in
it
to
his
inn
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
we
be
alone
together
,
he
gently
upbraid
me
with
have
neglect
to
write
to
him
during
so
long
a
time
,
but
entirely
omit
the
mention
of
that
crime
which
have
occasion
it
.
<EOS>
He
then
inform
me
of
my
mother
's
death
,
and
insist
on
my
return
home
with
him

say
,

that
he
have
long
suffer
the
great
anxiety
on
my
account

he
know
not
whether
he
have
most
fear
my
death

wish
it

since
he
have
so
many
more
dreadful
apprehension
for
me

<EOS>
at
last
,
he
say
,
a
neighbour
gentleman
,
who
have
just
recover
a
son
from
the
same
place
,
inform
him
where
I
be
;
and
that
to
reclaim
me
from
this
course
of
life
be
the
sole
cause
of
his
journey
to
London
.

<EOS>
He
thank
Heaven
he
have
succeed
so
far
as
to
find
me
out
by
mean
of
an
accident
which
have
like
to
have
prove
fatal
to
him
;
and
have
the
pleasure
to
think
he
partly
owe
his
preservation
to
my
humanity
,
with
which
he
profest
himself
to
be
more
delighted
than
he
should
have
be
with
my
filial
piety

I
have
know
that
the
object

all
my
care

my

insensibility

so
unworthily
bestow

I
presently
promise
to
obey
his
command
in
my
return
home
with
him

as
soon
as
he
be
able

travel

excellent

"
the
day
precede
my
father
's
journey
(
before
which
time
I
scarce
ever
leave
him

I
go
to
take
my
leave
of
some
of
my
most
intimate
acquaintance

particularly
of
Mr
Watson

who
dissuade
me
from
bury
myself
,
as
he
call
it

out
of
a
simple
compliance
with
the
fond
desire
of
a
foolish
old
fellow

<EOS>
such
sollicitation
,
however
,
have
no
effect

I
once
more
see
my
own
home

<EOS>
My
father
now
greatly
sollicite
me
to
think
of
marriage
;
but
my
inclination
be
utterly
averse
to
any
such
thought
.
<EOS>
I
have
taste
of
love
already
,
and
perhaps
you
know
the
extravagant
excess
of
that
most
tender
and
most
violent
passion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
here
the
old
gentleman
pause
,
and
look
earnestly
at
Jones
;
whose
countenance
,
within
a
minute
's
space
,
display
the
extremity
of
both
red
and
white
.
<EOS>
upon
which
the
old
man
,
without
make
any
observation
,
renew
his
narrative
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
now
provide
with
all
the
necessary
of
life
,
I
betook
myself
once
again
to
study
,
and
that
with
a
more
inordinate
application
than
I
have
ever
do
formerly
.
<EOS>
the
book
which
now
employ
my
time
solely
be
those
,
as
well
antient
as
modern
,
which
treat
of
true
philosophy
,
a
word
which
be
by
many
thought
to
be
the
subject
only
of
farce
and
ridicule
.
<EOS>
I
now
read
over
the
work
of
Aristotle
and
Plato
,
with
the
rest
of
those
inestimable
treasure
which
antient
Greece
have
bequeath
to
the
world

<EOS>
"
these
author
,
though
they
instruct
me
in
no
science
by
which
man
may
promise
to
themselves
to
acquire
the
least
rich
or
worldly
power
,
teach
me
,
however
,
the
art
of
despise
the
high
acquisition
of
both
.
<EOS>
They
elevate
the
mind
,
and
steel
and
harden
it
against
the
capricious
invasion
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
They
not
only
instruct
in
the
knowledge
of
wisdom
,
but
confirm
man
in
her
habit
,
and
demonstrate
plainly
,
that
this
must
be
our
guide
,
if
we
propose
ever
to
arrive
at
the
great
worldly
happiness
,
or
to
defend
ourselves
,
with
any
tolerable
security

against
the
misery
which
everywhere
surround
and
invest
us

<EOS>
"
to
this
I
add
another
study
,
compare
to
which
,
all
the
philosophy
teach
by
the
wise
heathen
be
little
well
than
a
dream
,
and
be
indeed
as
full
of
vanity
as
the
silly
jester
ever
please
to
represent
it
.
<EOS>
this
be
that
divine
wisdom
which
be
alone
to
be
find
in
the
Holy
Scriptures
;
for
they
impart
to
us
the
knowledge
and
assurance
of
thing
much
more
worthy
our
attention
than
all
which
this
world
can
offer
to
our
acceptance
;
of
thing
which
Heaven
itself
hath
condescend
to
reveal
to
us
,
and
to
the
small
knowledge
of
which
the
high
human
wit
unassiste
could
never
ascend
.
<EOS>
I
begin
now
to
think
all
the
time
I
have
spend
with
the
good
heathen
writer
be
little
more
than
labour
lose
:
for
,
however
pleasant
and
delightful
their
lesson
may
be
,
or
however
adequate
to
the
right
regulation
of
our
conduct
with
respect
to
this
world
only
;
yet
,
when
compare
with
the
glory
reveal
in
Scripture
,
their
high
document
will
appear
as
trifling
,
and
of
as
little
consequence
,
as
the
rule
by
which
child
regulate
their
childish
little
game
and
pastime
.
<EOS>
true
it
be
,
that
philosophy
make
us
wise
,
but
Christianity
make
us
well
man
.
<EOS>
philosophy
elevate
and
steel
the
mind
,
Christianity
soften
and
sweeten
it

the
former
make
us
the
object
of

insure
us

this
an

My

be
now
greatly
alter
by
the
death

good
of

for
my
brother

who
be
now

differ
so
widely

our
pursuit

have
be
so
very
various

that
we
be
the
bad
of
company
to
each
other

what
make
our
living
together
still
more
disagreeable
,
be
the
little
harmony
which
could
subsist
between
the
few
who
resort
to
me
,
and
the
numerous
train
of
sportsman
who
often
attend
my

for
such

the
noise

affront
and
contempt

so
much
the
case

neither
I
myself
,
nor
my
friend
,
could
ever
sit
down
to
a
meal
with
them
without
be
treat
with
derision
,
because
we
be
unacquainted
with
the
phrase
of
sportsman

man
of
true
learning
,
and
almost
universal
knowledge

always
compassionate
the
ignorance
of

fellow
who
excel
in
some
little
,
low
,
contemptible
art

be
always
certain
to
despise
those
who
be
unacquainted
with
that
art

<EOS>
"
in
short
,
we
soon
separate
,
and
I
go
,
by
the
advice
of
a
physician
,
to
drink
the
Bath
water
;
for
my
violent
affliction
,
add
to
a
sedentary
life
,
have
throw
me
into
a
kind
of
paralytic
disorder
,
for
which
those
water
be
account
an
almost
certain
cure
.
<EOS>
the
second
day
after
my
arrival
,
as
I
be
walk
by
the
river
,
the
sun
shine
so
intensely
hot
(
though
it
be
early
in
the
year
)
,
that
I
retire
to
the
shelter
of
some
willow
,
and
sit
down
by
the
river
side
.
<EOS>
here
I
have
not
be
seat
long
before
I
hear
a
person
on
the
other
side
of
the
willow
sigh
and
bemoan
himself
bitterly
.
<EOS>
on
a
sudden
,
have
utter
a
most
impious
oath
,
he
cry
,
"
I
be
resolve
to
bear
it
no
longer
,
"
and
directly
throw
himself
into
the
water
.
<EOS>
I
immediately
start
,
and
run
towards
the
place
,
call
at
the
same
time
as
loudly
as
I
could
for
assistance
.
<EOS>
an
angler
happen
luckily
to
be
a
-
fishing
a
little
below
me
,
though
some
very
high
sedge
have
hide
him
from
my
sight
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
come
up
,
and
both
of
us
together
,
not
without
some
hazard
of
our
life
,
draw
the
body
to
the
shore
.
<EOS>
at
first
we
perceive
no
sign
of
life
remain
;
but
have
hold
the
body
up
by
the
heel
(
for
we
soon
have
assistance
enough
)
,
it
discharge
a
vast
quantity
of
water
at
the
mouth
,
and
at
length
begin
to
discover
some
symptom
of
breathing
,
and
a
little
afterwards
to
move
both
its
hand
and
its
leg
.
  
<EOS>
"
an
apothecary
,
who
happen
to
be
present
among
other
,
advise
that
the
body
,
which
seem
now
to
have
pretty
well
empty
itself
of
water
,
and
which
begin
to
have
many
convulsive
motion

should
be
directly
take
up
,

carry
into

warm
bed

accordingly

apothecary

as
we
be
go
towards
an
inn

for
we
know
not
the
man

luckily
a
woman
meet
us

who
,
after
some
violent
screaming
,
tell
us
that

gentleman
lodge
at
her
house

when
I
have
see
the
man
safely
deposit
there

I
leave
him
to
the
care
of
the
apothecary
;
who
,
I
suppose
,
use
all
the
right
method
with
him
,
for
the
next
morning
I
hear
he
have
perfectly
recover
his
sense

<EOS>

I
then
go
to
visit
him

intend
to
search
out
,
as
well
as
I
could

the
cause
of
his
have
attempt
so
desperate
an
act
,

to
prevent

as
far
as
I
be
able

such
wicked
intention
for
the
future

I
be
no
sooner
admit
into
his
chamber
,
than
we
both
instantly
know
each
other
;
for
who
should
this
person
be
but
my
good
friend
Mr
Watson
!
<EOS>
here
I
will
not
trouble
you
with
what
past
at
our
first
interview
;
for
I
would
avoid
prolixity
as
much
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
pray
let
us
hear
all
,
"
cry
Partridge
;
"
I
want
mightily
to
know
what
bring
him
to
Bath

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
hear
everything
material

answer
the
stranger
;
and
then
proceed
to
relate
what
we
shall
proceed
to
write
,
after
we
have
give
a
short
breathing
time
to
both
ourselves
and
the
reader

<EOS>
in
which
the
Man
of
the
Hill
conclude
his
history
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Watson
,
"
continue
the
stranger
,
"
very
freely
acquaint
me
,
that
the
unhappy
situation
of
his
circumstance
,
occasion
by
a
tide
of
ill
luck
,
have
in
a
manner
force
him
to
a
resolution
of
destroy
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
now
begin
to
argue
very
seriously
with
him
,
in
opposition
to
this
heathenish
,
or
indeed
diabolical
,
principle
of
the
lawfulness
of
self
-
murder
;
and
say
everything
which
occur
to
me
on
the
subject
;
but
,
to
my
great
concern
,
it
seem
to
have
very
little
effect
on
him
.
<EOS>
He
seem
not
at
all
to
repent
of
what
he
have
do
,
and
give
me
reason
to
fear
he
would
soon
make
a
second
attempt
of
the
like
horrible
kind
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
I
have
finish
my
discourse
,
instead
of
endeavour
to
answer
my
argument
,
he
look
me
stedfastly
in
the
face
,
and
with
a
smile
say
,
"
You
be
strangely
alter
,
my
good
friend
,
since
I
remember
you
.
<EOS>
I
question
whether
any
of
our
bishop
could
make
a
well
argument
against
suicide
than
you
have
entertain
me
with
;
but
unless
you
can
find
somebody
who
will
lend
me
a
cool
hundred
,
I
must
either
hang
,
or
drown
,
or
starve
;
and
,
in
my
opinion
,
the
last
death
be
the
most
terrible
of
the
three
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
answer
him
very
gravely
that
I
be
indeed
alter
since
I
have
see
him
last
.
<EOS>
that
I
have
find
leisure
to
look
into
my
folly
and
to
repent
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
then
advise
him
to
pursue
the
same
step
;
and
at
last
conclude
with
an
assurance
that
I
myself
would
lend
him
a
hundred
pound
,
if
it
would
be
of
any
service
to
his
affair
,
and
he
would
not
put
it
into
the
power
of
a
die
to
deprive
him
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Watson
,
who
seem
almost
compose
in
slumber
by
the
former
part
of
my
discourse
,
be
rouse
by
the
latter
.
<EOS>
He
seize
my
hand
eagerly
,
give
me
a
thousand
thank
,
and
declare
I
be
a
friend
indeed
;
add
that
he
hope
I
have
a
well
opinion
of
him
than
to
imagine
he
have
profit
so
little
by
experience
,
as
to
put
any
confidence
in
those
damned
dice
which
have
so
often
deceive
him
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
"
cry
he
;
"
let
me
but
once
handsomely
be
set
up
again
,
and
if
ever
Fortune
make
a
broken
merchant
of
me
afterwards
,
I
will
forgive
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
very
well
understand
the
language
of
set
up
,
and
break
merchant
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
say
to
him
,
with
a
very
grave
face
,
Mr
Watson
,
you
must
endeavour
to
find
out
some
business
or
employment
,
by
which
you
may
procure
yourself
a
livelihood
;
and
I
promise
you
,
could
I
see
any
probability
of
be
repay
hereafter
,
I
would
advance
a
much
large
sum
than
what
you
have
mention
,
to
equip
you
in
any
fair
and
honourable
calling
;
but
as
to
gaming
,
besides
the
baseness
and
wickedness
of
make
it
a
profession
,
you
be
really
,
to
my
own
knowledge
,
unfit
for
it
,
and
it
will
end
in
your
certain
ruin
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
why
now
,
that
be
strange
,
"
answer
he
;
"
<EOS>
neither
you
,
nor
any
of
my
friend
,
would
ever
allow
me
to
know
anything
of
the
matter
,
and
yet
I
believe
I
be
as
good
a
hand
at
every
game
as
any
of
you
all
;
and
<EOS>
I
heartily
wish
I
be
to
play
with
you
only
for
your
whole
fortune
:
I
should
desire
no
well
sport
,
and
I
would
let
you
name
your
game
into
the
bargain
:
but
come
,
my
dear
boy
,
have
you
the
hundred
in
your
pocket
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
answer
I
have
only
a
bill
for
L50
,
which
I
deliver
him
,
and
promise
to
bring
him
the
rest
next
morning
;
and
after
give
him
a
little
more
advice
,
take
my
leave
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
indeed
well
than
my
word
;
for
I
return
to
him
that
very
afternoon
.
<EOS>
when
I
enter
the
room
,
I
find
him
sit
up
in
his
bed
at
card
with
a
notorious
gamester
.
<EOS>
this
sight
,
you
will
imagine
,
shock
me
not
a
little
;
to
which
I
may
add
the
mortification
of
see
my
bill
deliver
by
him
to
his
antagonist
,
and
thirty
guinea
only
give
in
exchange
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
other
gamester
presently
quit
the
room
,
and
then
Watson
declare
he
be
ashamed
to
see
me
;
"
but
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
find
luck
run
so
damnably
against
me
,
that
I
will
resolve
to
leave
off
play
for
ever
.
<EOS>
I
have
think
of
the
kind
proposal
you
make
me
ever
since
,
and
I
promise
you
there
shall
be
no
fault
in
me
,
if
I
do
not
put
it
in
execution
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
though
I
have
no
great
faith
in
his
promise
,
I
produce
him
the
remainder
of
the
hundred
in
consequence
of
my
own
;
for
which
he
give
me
a
note
,
which
be
all
I
ever
expect
to
see
in
return
for
my
money

<EOS>
"
We
be
prevent
from
any
further
discourse
at
present
by
the
arrival
of
the
apothecary
;
who
,
with
much
joy
in
his
countenance
,
and
without
even
ask
his
patient
how
he
do
,
proclaim
there
be
great
news
arrive
in
a
letter
to
himself
,
which
he
say
would
shortly
be
public
,
"
that
the
Duke
of
Monmouth
be
land
in
the
west
with
a
vast
army
of
Dutch
;
and
that
another
vast
fleet
hover
over
the
coast
of
Norfolk
,
and
be
to
make
a
descent
there
,
in
order
to
favour
the
duke
's
enterprize
with
a
diversion
on
that
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
apothecary
be
one
of
the
great
politician
of
his
time
.
<EOS>
He
be
more
delighted
with
the
most
paultry
packet
,
than
with
the
good
patient
,
and
the
high
joy
he
be
capable
of
,
he
receive
from
have
a
piece
of
news
in
his
possession
an
hour
or
two
soon
than
any
other
person
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
His
advice
,
however
,
be
seldom
authentic
;
for
he
would
swallow
almost
anything
as
a
truth
 
a
humour
which
many
make
use
of
to
impose
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
thus
it
happen
with
what
he
at
present
communicate
;
for
it
be
know
within
a
short
time
afterwards
that
the
duke
be
really
land
,
but
that
his
army
consist
only
of
a
few
attendant
;
and
as
to
the
diversion
in
Norfolk
,
it
be
entirely
false

<EOS>

the
apothecary
staid
no
longer
in
the
room
than
while
he
acquaint
us
with
his
news
;

then
,
without
say
a
syllable
to
his
patient
on
any
other
subject

depart
to
spread
his
advice
all
over

town

"
event
of
this
nature
in
the
public
be
generally
apt
to
eclipse
all
private
concern
.
<EOS>
Our
discourse
therefore
now
become
entirely
political
.
<EOS>
[
*
]
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
have
be
for
some
time
very
seriously
affected
with
the
danger
to
which
the
protestant
religion
be
so
visibly
expose
under
a
popish
prince
,
and
think
the
apprehension
of
it
alone
sufficient
to
justify
that
insurrection
;
for
no
real
security
can
ever
be
find
against
the
persecuting
spirit
of
Popery
,
when
arm
with
power
,
except
the
deprive
it
of
that
power
,
as
woeful
experience
presently
show
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
King
James
behave
after
get
the
well
of
this
attempt
;
how
little
he
value
either
his
royal
word
,
or
coronation
oath
,
or
the
liberty
and
right
of
his
people
.
<EOS>
but
all
have
not
the
sense
to
foresee
this
at
first
;
and
therefore
the
Duke
of
Monmouth
be
weakly
support
;
yet
all
could
feel
when
the
evil
come
upon
them
;
and
therefore
all
united
,
at
last
,
to
drive
out
that
king
,
against
whose
exclusion
<EOS>
a
great
party
among
us
have
so
warmly
contend
during
the
reign
of
his
brother
,
and
for
whom
they
now
fight
with
such
zeal
and
affection
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
you
say
,
"
interrupt
Jones
,
"
be
very
true
;
and
it
have
often
strike
me
,
as
the
most
wonderful
thing
I
ever
read
of
in
history
,
that
so
soon
after
this
convincing
experience
which
bring
our
whole
nation
to
join
so
unanimously
in
expel
King
James
,
for
the
preservation
of
our
religion
and
liberty
,
there
should
be
a
party
among
us
mad
enough
to
desire
the
place
his
family
again
on
the
throne
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
in
earnest
!
"
answer
the
old
man
;
"
there
can
be
no
such
party
.
<EOS>
as
bad
an
opinion
as
I
have
of
mankind
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
believe
them
infatuate
to
such
a
degree
.
<EOS>
there
may
be
some
hot
-
head
papist
lead
by
their
priest
to
engage
in
this
desperate
cause
,
and
think
it
a
holy
war
;
but
that
Protestants
,
that
be
member
of
the
Church
of
England
,
should
be
such
apostate
,
such
felos
de
se

I
can
not
believe
it
;
no
,
no
,
young
man
,
unacquainte
as
I
be
with
what
have
past
in
the
world
for
these
last
thirty
year
,
I
can
not
be
so
impose
upon
as
to
credit
so
foolish
a
tale
;
but
I
see
you
have
a
mind
to
sport
with
my
ignorance
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Can
it
be
possible
,
"
reply
Jones
,
"
that
you
have
live
so
much
out
of
the
world
as
not
to
know
that
during
that
time
there
have
be
two
rebellion
in
favour
of
the
son
of
King
James
,
one
of
which
be
now
actually
rage
in
the
very
heart
of
the
kingdom

<EOS>
"
at
these
word
the
old
gentleman
start
up
,
and
in
a
most
solemn
tone
of
voice
,
conjure
Jones
by
his
Maker
to
tell
him
if
what
he
say
be
really
true
;
which
the
other
as
solemnly
affirm
,
he
walk
several
turn
about
the
room
in
a
profound
silence
,
then
cry
,
then
laugh
,
and
at
last
fall
down
on
his
knee

and
bless
God
,
in
a
loud
thanksgiving
prayer

for
have
deliver
him
from
all
society

human
nature

could
be
capable

such
monstrous
extravagance

<EOS>
as
mankind

in
the
day
I
be
speak
of

be
not

arrive
at
that
pitch
of
madness
which
I
find
they
be
capable
of
now

and
which
,
to
be
sure
,
I
have
only
escape
by
live
alone
,
and
at
a
distance
from
the
contagion
,
there
be
a
considerable
rise
in
favour
of
Monmouth
;
and
my
principle
strongly
incline
me
to
take
the
same
part
,
I
determine
to
join
him
;
and
Mr
Watson
,
from
different
motive
concur
in
the
same
resolution
(
for
the
spirit
of
a
gamester
will
carry
a
man
as
far
upon
such
an
occasion
as
the
spirit
of
patriotism

we
soon
provide
ourselves
with
all
necessary

to
the
duke
at
Bridgewater

,
together
with
Mr
Watson

from
the
battle
at
Sedgemore

action
I
receive
a
slight
wound

We
ride
near
forty
mile
together
on
the
Exeter
road

then
abandon
our
horse
,
scramble
as
well
as
we
could
through
the
field

we

little
wild
hut

poor
old

me
the
next
morning

in

to
get
us
some
provision
from

Collumpton

I

the
soldier

be
six
in

now
seize
me

be
conduct
me
to
Taunton
gaol

neither
my
present
situation

nor
the
apprehension

may

be

the
forwarder

two

sting
me
to
the
quick

raise
an
indignation
scarce
conceivable
by
those
who
have
not

it

however

fortune
at
length
take
pity
on

as

be
get
a
little
beyond
Wellington

in

narrow
lane

my
guard
receive
a
false
alarm

that
near
fifty
of
the
enemy
be
at
hand
;
upon
which
they
shift
for
themselves
,
and
leave
me
and
my
betrayer
to
do
the
same

<EOS>
that
villain
immediately
run
from
me

I
be
glad
he
do
,
or
I
should
have
certainly
endeavour
,
though
I
have
no
arm

to
have
execute
vengeance
on
his
baseness

<EOS>
"
I
be
now
once
more
at
liberty
;
and
immediately
withdraw
from
the
highway
into
the
field
,
I
travel
on
,
scarce
knowing
which
way
I
go
,
and
make
it
my
chief
care
to
avoid
all
public
road
and
all
town
 
nay

even
the
most
homely
house
;

I
imagine
every
human
creature

I

desirous

me

<EOS>
"
at
last

after
ramble
several
day
about
the
country

during
which
the
field
afford
me
the
same
bed

the
same
food
which
nature
bestow
on
our
savage
brother
of
the
creation

I
at
length
arrive
at
this
place
,
where
the
solitude
and
wildness
of
the
country
invite
me
to
fix
my
abode
.
<EOS>
the
first
person
with
whom
I
take
up
my
habitation

the
mother
of
this
old
woman

whom
I
remain

the
news
of
the
glorious
revolution
put
an
end

all
my

me
an
opportunity
of
once
more

my

of
enquire
a
little
into
my
affair

which
I
soon
settle
as
agreeably
to
my
brother

to
myself

have
resign
everything
to
him
,
for
which
he
pay
me
the
sum
of
a
thousand

on
me
an
annuity

life

His
behaviour

I
could
not
look
on
him
as
my

indeed
do
he
desire
that
I
should

so
I
presently
take
my
leave

as
well
as
of

Jones

ask
it
of

indeed
it
would
be
cruel
,
after
so
much
breath
as
you
have
already
spend
:
but
you
will
give
me
leave
to
wish
for
some
further
opportunity
of
hear
the
excellent
observation
which
a

have

in
so
long
a
course

your
curiosity

attempt
fresh
apology

while
he

Partridge
sit
with
greedy

<EOS>
[

<EOS>
the
rest
of
this
paragraph
and
the
two
follow
paragraph
  
in
the
first
edition
be
as
follow
:
    
"
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
have
be
for
some
time
very
seriously
affect
  
with
the
danger
to
which
the
protestant
religion
be
so
visibly
  
expose
,
that
nothing
but
the
immediate
interposition
of
Providence
  
seem
capable
of
preserve
it
;
for
King
James
have
indeed
declare
  
war
against
the
Protestant
cause
.
<EOS>
He
have
bring
know
papist
into
  
the
army
and
attempt
to
bring
them
into
the
Church
and
into
the
  
University
.
<EOS>
popish
priest
swarm
through
the
nation
,
appear
  
publicly
in
their
habit
,
and
boast
that
they
should
shortly
walk
  
in
procession
through
the
street
.
<EOS>
Our
own
clergy
be
forbid
to
  
preach
against
popery
,
and
bishop
be
order
to
supend
those
who
  
do
;
and
to
do
the
business
at
once
an
illegal
ecclesiastical
  
commission
be
erect
,
little
inferior
to
an
inquisition
,
of
which
,
  
probably
,
it
be
intend
to
be
the
ringleader
.
<EOS>
thus
,
as
our
duty
to
  
the
king
can
never
be
call
more
than
our
second
duty
,
he
have
  
discharge
us
from
this
by
make
it
incompatible
with
our
  
preserve
the
first
,
which
be
surely
to
heaven
.
<EOS>
besides
this
,
he
  
have
dissolve
his
subject
from
their
allegiance
by
break
his
  
Coronation
Oath
,
to
which
their
allegiance
be
annex
;
for
he
have
  
imprison
bishop
because
they
would
not
give
up
their
religion
,
  
and
turn
out
judge
because
they
would
not
absolutely
surrender
  
the
law
into
his
hand
;
<EOS>
nay
,
he
seize
this
himself
,
and
when
he
  
claim
a
dispense
power
,
he
declare
himself
,
in
fact
,
as
  
absolute
as
any
tyrant
ever
be
or
can
be
.
<EOS>
I
have
recapitulate
  
these
matter
in
full
l
some
of
them
should
have
be
omit
in
  
history
;
and
I
think
nothing
less
than
such
provocation
as
I
have
  
here
mention
,
nothing
less
than
certain
and
imminent
danger
to
  
their
religion
and
liberty
,
can
justify
or
even
mitigate
the
  
dreadful
sin
of
rebellion
in
any
people
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
I
promise
you
,
sir
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
all
these
fact
,
and
more
<EOS>
,
I
have
  
read
in
history
,
but
I
will
tell
you
a
fact
which
be
not
yet
  
record
and
of
which
I
suppose
you
be
ignorant
.
<EOS>
there
be
actually
  
now
a
rebellion
on
foot
in
this
kingdom
in
favour
of
the
son
of
that
  
<EOS>
very
King
James
,
a
professed
papist
,
more
bigoted
,
if
possible
,
than
  
his
father
,
and
this
carry
on
by
Protestants
against
a
king
who
  
hath
never
in
one
single
instance
make
the
least
invasion
on
our
  
liberty
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
"
Prodigious
indeed
!
"
answer
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
You
tell
me
what
would
  
be
incredible
of
a
nation
which
do
not
deserve
the
character
that
  
Virgil
give
of
a
woman
,
varium
et
mutabile
semper
.
<EOS>
surely
this
be
  
to
be
unworthy
of
the
care
which
Providence
seem
to
have
take
of
  
us
in
the
preservation
of
our
religion
against
the
powerful
design
  
and
constant
machination
of
Popery
,
a
preservation
so
strange
and
  
<EOS>
unaccountable
that
I
almost
think
we
may
appeal
to
it
as
to
a
  
miracle
for
the
proof
of
its
holiness
.
<EOS>
prodigious
indeed
!
<EOS>
a
  
protestant
rebellion
in
favour
of
a
popish
prince
!
<EOS>
the
folly
of
  
mankind
be
as
wonderful
as
their
knavery
 
<EOS>
but
to
conclude
my
story
:
  
I
resolve
to
take
arm
in
defence
of
my
country
,
of
my
religion
,
  
and
my
liberty
,
and
Mr.
Watson
join
in
the
same
resolution
.
<EOS>
We
  
soon
provide
ourselves
with
an
necessary
and
join
the
Duke
at
  
bridgewater
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
the
unfortunate
event
of
this
enterprise
you
be
perhaps
well
  
acquaint
with
than
myself
.
<EOS>
I
escape
together
with
Mr.
Watson
from
  
the
battle
at
Sedgemore
,
...
    
<EOS>
a
brief
history
of
Europe
;
and
a
curious
discourse
between
Mr
Jones
and
the
Man
of
the
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
"
in
Italy
the
landlord
be
very
silent
.
<EOS>
in
France
they
be
more
talkative
,
but
yet
civil
.
<EOS>
in
Germany
and
Holland
they
be
generally
very
impertinent
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
their
honesty
,
I
believe
it
be
pretty
equal
in
all
those
country
.
<EOS>
the
laquai
a
louange
be
sure
to
lose
no
opportunity
of
cheat
you
;
and
as
for
the
postilion
,
I
think
they
be
pretty
much
alike
all
the
world
over
.
<EOS>
these
,
sir
,
be
the
observation
on
man
which
I
make
in
my
travel
;
for
these
be
the
only
man
I
ever
converse
with
.
<EOS>
My
design
,
when
I
go
abroad
,
be
to
divert
myself
by
see
the
wondrous
variety
of
prospect
,
beast
,
bird
,
fish
,
insect
,
and
vegetable
,
with
which
God
have
be
please
to
enrich
the
several
part
of
this
globe
;
a
variety
which
,
as
it
must
give
great
pleasure
to
a
contemplative
beholder
,
so
doth
it
admirably
display
the
power
,
and
wisdom
,
and
goodness
of
the
Creator
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
to
say
the
truth
,
there
be
but
one
work
in
his
whole
creation
that
doth
him
any
dishonour
,
and
with
that
I
have
long
since
avoid
hold
any
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
pardon
me
,
"
cry
Jones
;
"
but
I
have
always
imagine
that
there
be
in
this
very
work
you
mention
as
great
variety
as
in
all
the
rest
;
for
,
besides
the
difference

inclination

the
utmost
diversity
into
human
nature

<EOS>
very
little
indeed

answer
the
other
:
"
those
who
travel
in
order
to
acquaint
themselves
with
the
different
manner
of
man
may
spare
themselves
much
pain
by
go
to
a
carnival
at
Venice
;
for
there
they
will
see
at
once
all
which
they
can
discover
in
the
several
court
of
Europe

<EOS>
the
same
hypocrisy

fraud

in

the
same
folly

vice

habit

with
vast

for

I

do
not

nation

you
travel
less
troublesome

Jones

yes

old
man
:

the
Turks
be
much
more
tolerable

profound
taciturnity

never

with
question

then
indeed
they
bestow
a
short
curse
upon
him

spit
in
his
face

then
they

they

call
it

indeed
set
forth
their
own
vanity
;
they
be
so
troublesome
,
that
I
have
infinitely
rather
pass
my
life
with
the
Hottentots
than
set
my
foot
in
Paris
again

<EOS>
They
be

nasty
people

their
nastiness
be
mostly
without

whereas
,
in
France
,
and
some
other
nation
that
I
will
not
name

it
be
all
within

thus
,
sir

I

end
the

for
as
to
all
that
series
of

during
which
I
have
live

it
afford
no

to
entertain
you

may
be
almost
consider
as
one
day
.
<EOS>
[

the
retirement
have
be
so
compleat
,
that
I
could
hardly
have
enjoy
a
more
absolute
solitude
in
the
desert
of
the
Thebais
than
here
in
the
midst
of
this
populous
kingdom
.
<EOS>
as
I
have
no
estate
,
I
be
plague
with
no
tenant
or
steward
:
my
annuity
be
pay
me
pretty
regularly
,
as
indeed
it
ought
to
be
;
for
it
be
much
less
than
what
I
may
have
expect
in
return
for
what
I
give
up
.
<EOS>
visit
<EOS>
I
admit
none
;
and
the
old
woman
who
keep
my
house
know
that
her
place
entirely
depend
upon
her
save
me
all
the
trouble
of
buy
the
thing
that
I
want
,
keep
off
all
sollicitation
or
business
from
me
,
and
hold
her
tongue
whenever
I
be
within
hear
.
<EOS>
as
my
walk
be
all
by
night
,
I
be
pretty
secure
in
this
wild
unfrequented
place
from
meet
any
company
.
<EOS>
some
few
person
I
have
meet
by
chance
,
and
send
them
home
heartily
fright
,
as
from
the
oddness
of
my
dress
and
figure
they
take
me
for
a
ghost
or
a
hobgoblin
.
<EOS>
but
what
have
happen
to

night
show
that
even
here
I
can
not
be
safe
from
the
villany
of

for
without

I
have
not

very

murder

some

<EOS>

I
be

that
to
one
whose

be
fix
on

my
hour
should
appear
to
have
want

this
place

but
there
be
one
single
act
,
for
which
the
whole
life
of

be
infinitely
too
short
:
what
time
can
suffice
for
the
contemplation
and
worship
of
that
glorious
,
immortal
,
and
eternal
being
,
among
the
work
of
whose
stupendous
creation
not
only
this

even
those
numberless
luminary

we
may

behold
spangle
all

though
they
should
many
of
them
be

light

possibly
appear

as
a

Can
a

by

meditation

admit

ineffable

incomprehensible

think
day

too
long

the
continuance
of
so
ravish
an

<EOS>
Shall
the

amusement
,
the
palling
pleasure
,
the
silly
business
of
the
world
,
roll
away
our
hour
too
swiftly
from
us
;
and
shall
the
pace
of
time
seem
sluggish

in

so
high

as

no

<EOS>
It

not

it

that

"
  
<EOS>
"
in
the
former
part
of
what
you
say
,
"
reply
Jones
,
"
I
most
heartily
and
readily
concur
;
but
I
believe
,
as
well
as
hope
,
that
the
abhorrence
which
you
express
for
mankind
in
the
conclusion
,
be
much
too
general
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
you
here
fall
into
an
error
,
which
in
my
little
experience
I
have
observe
to
be
a
very
common
one
,
by
take
the
character
of
mankind
from
the
bad
and
base
among
them
;
whereas
,
indeed
,
as
an
excellent
writer
observe
,
nothing
should
be
esteem
as
characteristical
of
a
species
,
but
what
be
to
be
find
among
the
good
and
most
perfect
individual
of
that
specie
.
<EOS>
this
error
,
I
believe
,
be
generally
commit
by
those
who
from
want
of
proper
caution
in
the
choice
of
their
friend
and
acquaintance
,
have
suffer
injury
from
bad
and
worthless
man
;
two
or
three
instance
of
which
be
very
unjustly
charge
on
all
human
nature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
experience
enough
of
it
,
"
answer
the
other
:
"
my
first
mistress
and
my
first
friend
betray
me
in
the
basest
manner
,
and
in
matter
which
threaten
to
be
of
the
bad
of
consequence
 
even
to
bring
me
to
a
shameful
death

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
pardon
me
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
if
I
desire
you
to
reflect
who
that
mistress
and
who
that
friend
be

<EOS>
what
better
,
my
good
sir
,
could
be
expect
in
love
derive
from
the
stew
,
or
in
friendship
first
produce
and
nourish
at
the
gaming

table
?
<EOS>
to
take
the
character
of
woman
from
the
former
instance
,
or
of
man
from
the
latter
,
would
be
as
unjust
as
to
assert
that
air
be
a
nauseous
and
unwholesome
element
,
because
we
find
it
so
in
a
jake
.
<EOS>
I
have
live
but
a
short
time
in
the
world

and
yet
have
know
man
worthy
of

high

of

high

<EOS>
"
alas

<EOS>
young
man
,
"
answer
the
stranger
,
"
you
have
live
,
you
confess
,
but
a
very
short
time
in
the
world
:
I
be
somewhat
old
than
you
when
I
be
of
the
same
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
have
remain
so
still
,
"
reply
Jones
,
"
if
you
have
not
be
unfortunate
,
I
will
venture
to
say
incautious
,
in
the
place
your
affection

<EOS>
if
there
be
,
indeed
,
much
more
wickedness
in
the
world
than
there
be
,
it
would
not
prove
such
general
assertion
against
human
nature
,
since
much
of
this
arrive
by
mere
accident
,
and
many
a
man
who
commit
evil
be
not
totally
bad
and
corrupt
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
in
truth
,
none
seem
to
have
any
title
to
assert
human
nature
to
be
necessarily
and
universally
evil
,
but
those
whose
own
mind
afford
them
one
instance
of
this
natural
depravity
;
which
be
not
,
I
be
convinced
,
your
case
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
such
,
"
say
the
stranger
,
"
will
be
always
the
most
backward
to
assert
any
such
thing
.
<EOS>
Knaves
will
no
more
endeavour
to
persuade
us
of
the
baseness
of
mankind
,
than
a
highwayman
will
inform
you
that
there
be
thief
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
this
would
,
indeed
,
be
a
method
to
put
you
on
your
guard
,
and
to
defeat
their
own
purpose
.
<EOS>
for
which
reason
,
though
knave
,
as
I
remember
,
be
very
apt
to
abuse
particular
person
,
yet
they
never
cast
any
reflection
on
human
nature
in
general
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
speak
this
so
warmly
,
that
as
Jones
despair
of
make
a
convert
,
and
be
unwilling
to
offend
,
he
return
no
answer
.
  
<EOS>
the
day
now
begin
to
send
forth
its
first
stream
of
light
,
when
Jones
make
an
apology
to
the
stranger
for
have
staid
so
long
,
and
perhaps
detain
him
from
his
rest
.
<EOS>
the
stranger
answer
,
"
He
never
want
rest
less
than
at
present
;
for
that
day
and
night
be
indifferent
season
to
him
;
and
that
he
commonly
make
use
of
the
former
for
the
time
of
his
repose
and
of
the
latter
for
his
walk
and
lucubration
.
<EOS>
however
,
"
say
he
,
"
it
be
now
a
most
lovely
morning
,
and
if
you
can
bear
any
longer
to
be
without
your
own
rest
or
food
,
I
will
gladly
entertain
you
with
the
sight
of
some
very
fine
prospect
which
I
believe
you
have
not
yet
see
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
very
readily
embrace
this
offer
,
and
they
immediately
set
forward
together
from
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
as
for
Partridge
,
he
have
fall
into
a
profound
repose
just
as
the
stranger
have
finish
his
story
;
for
his
curiosity
be
satisfied
,
and
the
subsequent
discourse
be
not
forcible
enough
in
its
operation
to
conjure
down
the
charm
of
sleep
.
<EOS>
Jones
therefore
leave
him
to
enjoy
his
nap
;
and
as
the
reader
may
perhaps
be
at
this
season
glad
of
the
same
favour
,
we
will
here
put
an
end
to
the
eighth
book
of
our
history
.
  
<EOS>
BOOK
IX
.
  
<EOS>
contain
twelve
HOURS
.
    
<EOS>
of
those
who
lawfully
may
,
and
of
those
who
may
not
,
write
such
history
as
this
.
 
<EOS>
among
other
good
use
for
which
I
have
think
proper
to
institute
these
several
introductory
chapter
,
I
have
consider
them
as
a
kind
of
mark
or
stamp
,
which
may
hereafter
enable
a
very
indifferent
reader
to
distinguish
what
be
true
and
genuine
in
this
historic
kind
of
writing
,
from
what
be
false
and
counterfeit
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
seem
likely
that
some
such
mark
may
shortly
become
necessary
,
since
the
favourable
reception
which
two
or
three
author
have
lately
procure
for
their
work
of
this
nature
from
the
public
,
will
probably
serve
as
an
encouragement
to
many
other
to
undertake
the
like
.
<EOS>
thus
a
swarm
of
foolish
novel
and
monstrous
romance
will
be
produce
,
either
to
the
great
impoverishing
of
bookseller
,
or
to
the
great
loss
of
time
and
depravation
of
moral
in
the
reader
;
nay
,
often
to
the
spreading
of
scandal
and
calumny
,
and
to
the
prejudice
of
the
character
of
many
worthy
and
honest
people
.
  
<EOS>
I
question
not
but
the
ingenious
author
of
the
Spectator
be
principally
induce
to
prefix
greek
and
Latin
motto
to
every
paper
,
from
the
same
consideration
of
guard
against
the
pursuit
of
those
scribbler
,
who
have
no
talent
of
a
writer
but
what
be
teach
by
the
writing
-
master
,
be
yet
nowise
afraid
nor
ashamed
to
assume
the
same
title
with
the
great
genius
,
than
their
good
brother
in
the
fable
<EOS>
be
of
bray
in
the
lion
's
skin
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
device
therefore
of
his
motto
,
it
become
impracticable
for
any
man
to
presume
to
imitate
the
Spectators
,
without
understand
at
least
one
sentence
in
the
learned
language
.
<EOS>
in
the
same
manner
I
have
now
secure
myself
from
the
imitation
of
those
who
be
utterly
incapable
of
any
degree
of
reflection
,
and
whose
learning
be
not
equal
to
an
essay
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
not
be
here
understand
to
insinuate
,
that
the
great
merit
of
such
historical
production
can
ever
lie
in
these
introductory
chapter
;
but
,
in
fact
,
those
part
which
contain
mere
narrative
only
,
afford
much
more
encouragement
to
the
pen
of
an
imitator
,
than
those
which
be
compose
of
observation
and
reflection
.
<EOS>
here
I
mean
such
imitator
as
Rowe
be
of
Shakespear
,
or
as
Horace
hint
some
of
the
Romans
be
of
Cato
,
by
bare
foot
and
sour
face
.
  
<EOS>
to
invent
good
story
,
and
to
tell
them
well
,
be
possibly
very
rare
talent
,
and
yet
I
have
observe
few
person
who
have
scruple
to
aim
at
both
:
<EOS>
and
if
we
examine
the
romance
and
novel
with
which
the
world
abound
,
I
think
we
may
fairly
conclude
,
that
most
of
the
author
would
not
have
attempt
to
show
their
tooth
(
if
the
expression
may
be
allow
me
)
in
any
other
way
of
writing
;
nor
could
indeed
have
string
together
a
dozen
sentence
on
any
other
subject
whatever
.

FRANCIS

<EOS>
may
be
more
truly
say
of
the
historian
and
biographer
,
than
of
any
other
specie
of
writing
;
for
all
the
art

science
(
even
criticism
itself
)
require
some
little
degree
of
learning
and
knowledge
.
<EOS>
poetry
,
indeed
,
may
perhaps
be
think
an
exception
;
but
then
it
demand
number
,
or
something
like
number
:
whereas
,
to
the
composition
of
novel
and
romance
,
nothing
be
necessary
but
paper
,
pen
,
and
ink
,
with
the
manual
capacity
of
use
them
.
<EOS>
this
,
I
conceive
,
their
production
show
to
be
the
opinion
of
the
author
themselves
:
and
this
must
be
the
opinion
of
their
reader
,
if
indeed
there
be
any
such
.
  
<EOS>
hence
we
be
to
derive
that
universal
contempt
which
the
world
,
who
always
denominate
the
whole
from
the
majority
,
have
cast
on
all
historical
writer
who
do
not
draw
their
material
from
record
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
the
apprehension
of
this
contempt
that
hath
make
us
so
cautiously
avoid
the
term
romance
,
a
name
with
which
we
may
otherwise
have
be
well
enough
content
.
<EOS>
though
,
as
we
have
good
authority
for
all
our
character
,
no
less
indeed
than
the
vast
authentic
doomsday
-
book
of
nature
,
as
be
elsewhere
hint
,
our
labour
have
sufficient
title
to
the
name
of
history
.
<EOS>
certainly
they
deserve
some
distinction
from
those
work
,
which
one
of
the
witty
of
man
regard
only
as
proceed
from
a
pruritus
,
or
indeed
rather
from
a
looseness
of
the
brain
.
  
<EOS>
but
besides
the
dishonour
which
be
thus
cast
on
one
of
the
most
useful
as
well
as
entertain
of
all
kind
of
writing
,
there
be
just
reason
to
apprehend
,
that
by
encourage
such
author
we
shall
propagate
much
dishonour
of
another
kind
;
I
mean
to
the
character
of
many
good
and
valuable
member
of
society
;
for
the
dull
writer
,
no
more
than
the
dull
companion
,
be
always
inoffensive
.
<EOS>
They
have
both
enough
of
language
to
be
indecent
and
abusive
.
<EOS>
and
surely
if
the
opinion
just
above
cite
be
true
,
we
can
not
wonder
that
work
so
nastily
derive
should
be
nasty
themselves
,
or
have
a
tendency
to
make
other
so
.
  
<EOS>
to
prevent
therefore
,
for
the
future
,
such
intemperate
abuse
of
leisure
,
of
letter
,
and
of
the
liberty
of
the
press
,
especially
as
the
world
seem
at
present
to
be
more
than
usually
threaten
with
them
,
I
shall
here
venture
to
mention
some
qualification
<EOS>
,
every
one
of
which
be
in
a
pretty
high
degree
necessary
to
this
order
of
historian
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
be
,
genius
,
without
a
full
vein
of
which
no
study
,
say
Horace
,
can
avail
us
.
<EOS>
by
genius
I
would
understand
that
power
or
rather
those
power
of
the
mind
,
which
be
capable
of
penetrate
into
all
thing
within
our
reach
and
knowledge
,
and
of
distinguish
their
essential
difference
.
<EOS>
these
be
no
other
than
invention
and
judgment
;
and
they
be
both
call
by
the
collective
name
of
genius
,
as
they
be
of
those
gift
of
nature
which
we
bring
with
us
into
the
world
.
<EOS>
concern
each
of
which
many
seem
to
have
fall
into
very
great
error
;
for
by
invention
,
I
believe
,
be
generally
understand
a
creative
faculty
,
which
would
indeed
prove
most
romance
writer
to
have
the
high
pretension
to
it
;
whereas
by
invention
be
really
mean
no
more
(
and
so
the
word
signifie
)
than
discovery
,
or
find
out
;
or
to
explain
it
at
large
,
a
quick
and
sagacious
penetration
into
the
true
essence
of
all
the
object
of
our
contemplation
.
<EOS>
this
,
I
think
,
can
rarely
exist
without
the
concomitancy
of
judgment
;
for
how
we
can
be
say
to
have
discover
the
true
essence
of
two
thing
,
without
discern
their
difference
,
seem
to
me
hard
to
conceive
.
<EOS>
now
this
last
be
the
undisputed
province
of
judgment
,
and
yet
some
few
man
of
wit
have
agree
with
all
the
dull
fellow
in
the
world
in
represent
these
two
to
have
be
seldom
or
never
the
property
of
one
and
the
same
person
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
they
should
be
so
,
they
be
not
sufficient
for
our
purpose
,
without
a
good
share
of
learning
;
for
which
I
could
again
cite
the
authority
of
Horace
,
and
of
many
other
,
if
any
be
necessary
to
prove
that
tool
be
of
no
service
to
a
workman
,
when
they
be
not
sharpen
by
art
,
or
when
he
want
rule
to
direct
him
in
his
work
,
or
hath
<EOS>
no
matter
to
work
upon
.
<EOS>
all
these
use
be
supply
by
learn
;
for
nature
can
only
furnish
us
with
capacity
;
or
,
as
I
have
choose
to
illustrate
it
,
with
the
tool
of
our
profession
;
learning
must
fit
them
for
use
,
must
direct
them
in
it
,
and
,
lastly
,
must
contribute
part
at
least
of
the
material
.
<EOS>
a
competent
knowledge
of
history
and
of
the
belle
-
lettre
be
here
absolutely
necessary
;
and
without
this
share
of
knowledge
at
least
,
to
affect
the
character
of
an
historian
,
be
as
vain
as
to
endeavour
at
build
a
house
without
timber
or
mortar
,
or
brick
or
stone
.
<EOS>
Homer
and
Milton
,
who
,
though
they
add
the
ornament
of
number
to
their
work
,
be
both
historian
of
our
order
,
be
master
of
all
the
learning
of
their
time
.
  
<EOS>
again
,
there
be
another
sort
of
knowledge
,
beyond
the
power
of
learn
to
bestow
,
and
this
be
to
be
have
by
conversation
.
<EOS>
so
necessary
be
this
to
the
understanding
the
character
of
man
,
that
none
be
more
ignorant
of
them
than
those
learn
pedant
whose
life
have
be
entirely
consume
in
college
,
and
among
book
;
for
however
exquisitely
human
nature
may
have
be
describe
by
writer
,
the
true
practical
system
can
be
learn
only
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
indeed
the
like
happen
in
every
other
kind
of
knowledge
.
<EOS>
neither
physic
nor
law
be
to
be
practically
know
from
book
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
the
farmer
,
the
planter
,
the
gardener
,
must
perfect
by
experience
what
he
hath
acquire
the
rudiment
of
by
read
.
<EOS>
how
accurately
soever
the
ingenious
Mr
Miller
may
have
describe
the
plant
,
he
himself
would
advise
his
disciple
to
see
it
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
as
we
must
perceive
,
that
after
the
nice
stroke
of
a
Shakespear
or
a
Jonson
,
of
a
Wycherly
or
an
Otway
,
some
touch
of
nature
will
escape
the
reader
,
which
the
judicious
action
of
a
Garrick
,
of
a
Cibber
,
or
a
Clive
,
[
*
]
can
convey
to
him
;
so
,
on
the
real
stage
,
the
character
show
himself
in
a
strong
and
bold
light
than
he
can
be
describe
.
<EOS>
and
if
this
be
the
case
in
those
fine
and
nervous
description
which
great
author
themselves
have
take
from
life
,
how
much
more
strongly
will
it
hold
when
the
writer
himself
take
his
line
not
from
nature
,
but
from
book
?
<EOS>
such
character
be
only
the
faint
copy
of
a
copy
,
and
can
have
neither
the
justness
nor
spirit
of
an
original
.
    
<EOS>
[
*
]
<EOS>
there
be
a
peculiar
propriety
in
mention
this
great
actor
,
  
and
these
two
most
justly
celebrate
actress
,
in
this
place
,
as
  
they
have
all
form
themselves
on
the
study
of
nature
only
,
and
not
  
on
the
imitation
of
their
predecessor
.
<EOS>
hence
they
have
be
able
to
  
excel
all
who
have
go
before
them
;
a
degree
of
merit
which
the
  
servile
herd
of
imitator
can
never
possibly
arrive
at
.
  
<EOS>
now
this
conversation
in
our
historian
must
be
universal
,
that
is
,
with
all
rank
and
degree
of
man
;
for
the
knowledge
of
what
be
call
high
life
will
not
instruct
him
in
low
;
nor
,
e
converso
,
will
his
be
acquaint
with
the
inferior
part
of
mankind
<EOS>
teach
him
the
manner
of
the
superior
.
<EOS>
and
though
it
may
be
think
that
the
knowledge
of
either
may
sufficiently
enable
him
to
describe
at
least
that
in
which
he
hath
be
conversant
,
yet
he
will
even
here
fall
greatly
short
of
perfection
;
for
the
folly
of
either
rank
do
in
reality
illustrate
each
other
.
<EOS>
for
instance
,
the
affectation
of
high
life
appear
more
glaring
and
ridiculous
from
the
simplicity
of
the
low
;
and
again
,
the
rudeness
and
barbarity
of
this
latter
,
strike
with
much
strong
idea
of
absurdity
,
when
contrast
with
,
and
oppose
to
,
the
politeness
which
controul
the
former
.
<EOS>
besides
,
to
say
the
truth
,
the
manner
of
our
historian
will
be
improve
by
both
these
conversation
;
for
in
the
one
he
will
easily
find
example
of
plainness
,
honesty
,
and
sincerity
;
in
the
other
of
refinement
,
elegance
,
and
a
liberality
of
spirit
;
which
last
quality
I
myself
have
scarce
ever
see
in
man
of
low
birth
and
education
.
  
<EOS>
nor
will
all
the
quality
I
have
hitherto
give
my
historian
<EOS>
avail
him
,
unless
he
have
what
be
generally
mean
by
a
good
heart
,
and
be
capable
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
the
author
who
will
make
me
weep
,
say
Horace
,
must
first
weep
himself
.
<EOS>
in
reality
,
no
man
can
paint
a
distress
well
which
he
doth
not
feel
while
he
be
paint
it
;
nor
do
I
doubt
,
but
that
the
most
pathetic
and
affect
scene
have
be
writ
with
tear
.
<EOS>
in
the
same
manner
it
be
with
the
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
I
be
convinced
I
never
make
my
reader
laugh
heartily
but
where
I
have
laugh
before
him
;
unless
it
should
happen
at
any
time
,
that
instead
of
laugh
with
me
he
should
be
incline
to
laugh
at
me
.
<EOS>
perhaps
this
may
have
be
the
case
at
some
passage
in
this
chapter
,
from
which
apprehension
I
will
here
put
an
end
to
it
.
    
<EOS>
contain
a
very
surprizing
adventure
indeed
,
which
Mr
Jones
meet
with
in
his
walk
with
the
Man
of
the
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
Aurora
now
first
open
her
casement
,
Anglice
the
day
begin
to
break
,
when
Jones
walk
forth
in
company
with
the
stranger
,
and
mount
Mazard
Hill
;
of
which
they
have
no
sooner
gain
the
summit
than
one
of
the
most
noble
prospect
in
the
world
present
itself
to
their
view
,
and
which
we
would
likewise
present
to
the
reader
,
but
for
two
reason
:
first
,
we
despair
of
make
those
who
have
see
this
prospect
admire
our
description
;
secondly
,
we
very
much
doubt
whether
those
who
have
not
see
it
would
understand
it
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
stand
for
some
minute
fix
in
one
posture
,
and
direct
his
eye
towards
the
south
;
upon
which
the
old
gentleman
ask
,
what
he
be
look
at
with
so
much
attention
?
"
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
sir
,
"
answer
he
with
a
sigh
,
"
I
be
endeavour
to
trace
out
my
own
journey
hither
.
<EOS>
good
heaven
!
<EOS>
what
a
distance
be
Gloucester
from
us
!
<EOS>
what
a
vast
track
of
land
must
be
between
me
and
my
own
home
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
,
young
gentleman
,
"
cry
the
other
,
"
and
by
your
sighing
,
from
what
you
love
better
than
your
own
home
,
or
I
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
I
perceive
now
the
object
of
your
contemplation
be
not
within
your
sight
,
and
yet
I
fancy
you
have
a
pleasure
in
look
that
way
.
"
<EOS>
Jones
answer
with
a
smile
,
"
I
find
,
old
friend
,
you
have
not
yet
forget
the
sensation
of
your
youth
.
<EOS>
I
own
my
thought
be
employ
as
you
have
guess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
now
walk
to
that
part
of
the
hill
which
look
to
the
north
-
west
,
and
which
hang
over
a
vast
and
extensive
wood
.
<EOS>
here
they
be
no
sooner
arrive
than
they
hear
at
a
distance
the
most
violent
scream
of
a
woman
,
proceed
from
the
wood
below
them
.
<EOS>
Jones
listen
a
moment
,
and
then
,
without
say
a
word
to
his
companion
(
for
indeed
the
occasion
seem
sufficiently
press
)
,
run
,
or
rather
slide
,
down
the
hill
,
and
,
without
the
least
apprehension
or
concern
for
his
own
safety
,
make
directly
to
the
thicket
,
whence
the
sound
have
issue
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
not
enter
far
into
the
wood
before
he
behold
a
most
shocking
sight
indeed
,
a
woman
stript
half
naked
,
under
the
hand
of
a
ruffian
,
who
have
put
his
garter
round
her
neck
,
and
be
endeavour
to
draw
her
up
to
a
tree
.
<EOS>
Jones
ask
no
question
at
this
interval
,
but
fall
instantly
upon
the
villain
,
and
make
such
good
use
of
his
trusty
oaken
stick
that
he
lay
him
sprawl
on
the
ground
before
he
could
defend
himself
,
indeed
almost
before
he
know
he
be
attack
;
nor
do
he
cease
the
prosecution
of
his
blow
till
the
woman
herself
beg
him
to
forbear
,
say
,
she
believe
he
have
sufficiently
do
his
business
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
wretch
then
fall
upon
her
knee
to
Jones
,
and
give
him
a
thousand
thank
for
her
deliverance
.
<EOS>
He
presently
lift
her
up
,
and
tell
her
he
be
highly
pleased
with
the
extraordinary
accident
which
have
send
him
thither
for
her
relief
,
where
it
be
so
improbable
<EOS>
she
should
find
any
;
add
,
that
Heaven
seem
to
have
design
him
as
the
happy
instrument
of
her
protection
.
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
answer
she
,
"
I
could
almost
conceive
you
to
be
some
good
angel
;
and
,
to
say
the
truth
,
you
look
more
like
an
angel
than
a
man
in
my
eye
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
indeed
he
be
a
charming
figure
;
and
if
a
very
fine
person
,
and
a
most
comely
set
of
feature
,
adorn
with
youth
,
health
,
strength
,
freshness
,
spirit
,
and
good
-
nature
,
can
make
a
man
resemble
an
angel
,
he
certainly
have
that
resemblance
.
  
<EOS>
the
redeemed
captive
have
not
altogether
so
much
of
the
human
-
angelic
specie
<EOS>
:
she
seem
to
be
at
least
of
the
middle
age
,
nor
have
her
face
much
appearance
of
beauty
;
but
her
cloath
be
tear
from
all
the
upper
part
of
her
body
,
her
breast
,
which
be
well
form
and
extremely
white
,
attract
the
eye
of
her
deliverer
,
and
for
a
few
moment
they
stand
silent
,
and
gaze
at
each
other
;
till
the
ruffian
on
the
ground
begin
to
move
,
Jones
take
the
garter
which
have
be
intend
for
another
purpose
,
and
bind
both
his
hand
behind
him
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
on
contemplate
his
face
,
he
discover
,
greatly
to
his
surprize
,
and
perhaps
not
a
little
to
his
satisfaction
,
this
very
person
to
be
no
other
than
ensign
Northerton
.
<EOS>
nor
have
the
ensign
forget
his
former
antagonist
,
whom
he
know
the
moment
he
come
to
himself
.
<EOS>
His
surprize
be
equal
to
that
of
Jones
;
but
I
conceive
his
pleasure
be
rather
less
on
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
help
Northerton
upon
his
leg
,
and
then
look
him
stedfastly
in
the
face
,
"
I
fancy
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
do
not
expect
to
meet
me
any
more
in
this
world
,
and
I
confess
I
have
as
little
expectation
to
find
you
here
.
<EOS>
however
,
fortune
,
I
see
,
hath
bring
us
once
more
together
,
and
hath
give
me
satisfaction
for
the
injury
I
have
receive
,
even
without
my
own
knowledge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
much
like
a
man
of
honour
,
indeed
,
"
answer
Northerton
,
"
to
take
satisfaction
by
knock
a
man
down
behind
his
back
.
<EOS>
neither
be
I
capable
of
give
you
satisfaction
here
,
as
I
have
no
sword
;
but
if
you
dare
behave
like
a
gentleman
,
let
us
go
where
I
can
furnish
myself
with
one
,
and
I
will
do
by
you
as
a
man
of
honour
ought
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
doth
it
become
such
a
villain
as
you
be
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
to
contaminate
the
name
of
honour
by
assume
it
?
<EOS>
but
I
shall
waste
no
time
in
discourse
with
you
.
<EOS>
justice
require
satisfaction
of
you
now
,
and
shall
have
it
.
"
<EOS>
then
turn
to
the
woman
,
he
ask
her
,
if
she
be
near
her
home
;
or
if
not
,
whether
she
be
acquaint
with
any
house
in
the
neighbourhood
,
where
she
may
procure
herself
some
decent
cloath
,
in
order
to
proceed
to
a
justice
of
the
peace
.
  
<EOS>
She
answer
she
be
an
entire
stranger
in
that
part
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
Jones
then
recollect
himself
,
say
,
he
have
a
friend
near
who
would
direct
them
;
indeed
,
he
wonder
at
his
not
follow
;
but
,
in
fact
,
the
good
man
of
the
Hill
,
when
our
heroe
depart
,
sit
himself
down
on
the
brow
,
where
,
though
he
have
a
gun
in
his
hand
,
he
with
great
patience
and
unconcern
have
attend
the
issue
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
then
step
without
the
wood
,
perceive
the
old
man
sit
as
we
have
just
describe
him
;
he
presently
exert
his
utmost
agility
,
and
with
surprize
expedition
ascend
the
hill
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
man
advise
him
to
carry
the
woman
to
Upton
,
which
,
he
say
,
be
the
near
town
,
and
there
he
would
be
sure
of
furnish
her
with
all
manner
of
conveniencie
.
<EOS>
Jones
have
receive
his
direction
to
the
place
,
take
his
leave
of
the
Man
of
the
Hill
,
and
,
desire
him
to
direct
Partridge
the
same
way
,
return
hastily
to
the
wood
.
  
<EOS>
Our
heroe
,
at
his
departure
to
make
this
enquiry
of
his
friend
,
have
consider
,
that
as
the
ruffian
's
hand
be
tie
behind
him
,
he
be
incapable
of
execute
any
wicked
purpose
on
the
poor
woman
.
<EOS>
besides
,
he
know
he
should
not
be
beyond
the
reach
of
her
voice
,
and
could
return
soon
enough
to
prevent
any
mischief
.
<EOS>
He
have
moreover
declare
to
the
villain
,
that
if
he
attempt
the
least
insult
,
he
would
be
himself
immediately
the
executioner
of
vengeance
on
him
.
<EOS>
but
Jones
unluckily
forget
,
that
though
the
hand
of
Northerton
be
tie
,
his
leg
be
at
liberty
;
nor
do
he
lay
the
least
injunction
on
the
prisoner
that
he
should
not
make
what
use
of
these
he
please
.
<EOS>
Northerton
therefore
have
give
no
parole
of
that
kind
,
think
he
may
without
any
breach
of
honour
depart
;
not
be
oblige
,
as
he
imagine
,
by
any
rule
,
to
wait
for
a
formal
discharge
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
take
up
his
leg
,
which
be
at
liberty
,
and
walk
off
through
the
wood
,
which
favour
his
retreat
;
nor
do
the
woman
,
whose
eye
be
perhaps
rather
turn
toward
her
deliverer
,
once
think
of
his
escape
,
or
give
herself
any
concern
or
trouble
to
prevent
it
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
therefore
,
at
his
return
,
find
the
woman
alone
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
spend
some
time
in
search
for
Northerton
,
but
she
would
not
permit
him
;
earnestly
entreat
that
he
would
accompany
her
to
the
town
whither
they
have
be
direct
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
to
the
fellow
's
escape
,
"
say
she
,
"
it
give
me
no
uneasiness
;
for
philosophy
and
Christianity
both
preach
up
forgiveness
of
injury
.
<EOS>
but
for
you
,
sir
,
I
be
concern
at
the
trouble
I
give
you
;
nay
,
indeed
,
my
nakedness
may
well
make
me
ashamed
to
look
you
in
the
face
;
and
if
it
be
not
for
the
sake
of
your
protection
,
I
should
wish
to
go
alone
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
offer
her
his
coat
;
but
,
I
know
not
for
what
reason
,
she
absolutely
refuse
the
most
earnest
solicitation
to
accept
it
.
<EOS>
He
then
beg
her
to
forget
both
the
cause
of
her
confusion
.
"
<EOS>
with
regard
to
the
former
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
have
do
no
more
than
my
duty
in
protect
you
;
and
as
for
the
latter
,
I
will
entirely
remove
it
,
by
walk
before
you
all
the
way
;
for
I
would
not
have
my
eye
offend
you
,
and
I
could
not
answer
for
my
power
of
resist
the
attractive
charm
of
so
much
beauty
.
"
  
<EOS>
thus
our
heroe
and
the
redeemed
lady
walk
in
the
same
manner
as
Orpheus
and
Eurydice
march
heretofore
;
but
though
I
can
not
believe
that
Jones
be
designedly
tempt
by
his
fair
one
to
look
behind
him
,
yet
as
she
frequently
want
his
assistance
to
help
her
over
stile
,
and
have
besides
many
trip
and
other
accident
,
he
be
often
oblige
to
turn
about
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
have
well
fortune
than
what
attend
poor
Orpheus
,
for
he
bring
his
companion
,
or
rather
follower
,
safe
into
the
famous
town
of
Upton
.
    
<EOS>
the
arrival
of
Mr
Jones
with
his
lady
at
the
inn
;
with
a
very
full
description
of
the
battle
of
Upton
.
 
<EOS>
though
the
reader
,
we
doubt
not
,
be
very
eager
to
know
who
this
lady
be
,
and
how
she
fall
into
the
hand
of
Mr
Northerton
,
we
must
beg
him
to
suspend
his
curiosity
for
a
short
time
,
as
we
be
oblige
,
for
some
very
good
reason
which
hereafter
perhaps
he
may
guess
,
to
delay
his
satisfaction
a
little
longer
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Jones
and
his
fair
companion
no
sooner
enter
the
town
,
than
they
go
directly
to
that
inn
which
in
their
eye
present
the
fair
appearance
to
the
street
.
<EOS>
here
Jones
,
have
order
a
servant
to
show
a
room
above
stair
,
be
ascend
,
when
the
dishevel
fair
,
hastily
follow
,
be
lay
hold
on
by
the
master
of
the
house
,
who
cry
,
"
Heyday
,
where
be
that
beggar
wench
go
?
<EOS>
stay
below
stair
,
I
desire
you
.
"
<EOS>
but
Jones
at
that
instant
thunder
from
above
,
"
let
the
lady
come
up
,
"
in
so
authoritative
a
voice
,
that
the
good
man
instantly
withdraw
his
hand
,
and
the
lady
make
the
good
of
her
way
to
the
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
here
Jones
wish
her
joy
of
her
safe
arrival
,
and
then
depart
,
in
order
,
as
he
promise
,
to
send
the
landlady
up
with
some
cloath
.
<EOS>
the
poor
woman
thank
him
heartily
for
all
his
kindness
,
and
say
,
she
hope
she
should
see
him
again
soon
,
to
thank
him
a
thousand
time
more
.
<EOS>
during
this
short
conversation
,
she
cover
her
white
bosom
as
well
as
she
could
possibly
with
her
arm
;
for
Jones
could
not
avoid
steal
a
sly
peep
or
two
,
though
he
take
all
imaginable
care
to
avoid
give
any
offence
.
  
<EOS>
Our
traveller
have
happen
to
take
up
their
residence
at
a
house
of
exceed
good
repute
,
whither
irish
lady
of
strict
virtue
,
and
many
northern
lass
of
the
same
predicament
,
be
accustomed
to
resort
in
their
way
to
Bath
.
<EOS>
the
landlady
therefore
would
by
no
means
have
admit
any
conversation
of
a
disreputable
kind
to
pass
under
her
roof
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
so
foul
and
contagious
be
all
such
proceeding
,
that
they
contaminate
the
very
innocent
scene
where
they
be
commit
,
and
give
the
name
of
a
bad
house
,
or
of
a
house
of
ill
repute
,
to
all
those
where
they
be
suffer
to
be
carry
on
.
  
<EOS>
not
that
I
would
intimate
that
such
strict
chastity
as
be
preserve
in
the
temple
of
Vesta
can
possibly
be
maintain
at
a
public
inn
.
<EOS>
My
good
landlady
do
not
hope
for
such
a
blessing
,
nor
would
any
of
the
lady
I
have
speak
of
,
or
indeed
any
other
of
the
most
rigid
note
,
have
expect
or
insist
on
any
such
thing
.
<EOS>
but
to
exclude
all
vulgar
concubinage
,
and
to
drive
all
whore
in
rag
from
within
the
wall
,
be
within
the
power
of
every
one
.
<EOS>
this
my
landlady
very
strictly
adhere
to
,
and
this
her
virtuous
guest
,
who
do
not
travel
in
rag
,
would
very
reasonably
have
expect
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
now
it
require
no
very
blameable
degree
of
suspicion
to
imagine
that
Mr
Jones
and
his
ragged
companion
have
certain
purpose
in
their
intention
,
which
,
though
tolerate
in
some
christian
country
,
connive
at
in
other
,
and
practise
in
all
,
be
however
as
expressly
forbid
as
murder
,
or
any
other
horrid
vice
,
by
that
religion
which
be
universally
believe
in
those
country
.
<EOS>
the
landlady
,
therefore
,
have
no
sooner
receive
an
intimation
of
the
entrance
of
the
above
-
say
person
than
she
begin
to
meditate
the
most
expeditious
mean
for
their
expulsion
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
this
,
she
have
provide
herself
with
a
long
and
deadly
instrument
,
with
which
,
in
time
of
peace
,
the
chambermaid
be
will
not
to
demolish
the
labours
of
the
industrious
spider
.
<EOS>
in
vulgar
phrase
,
she
have
take
up
the
broomstick
,
and
be
just
about
to
sally
from
the
kitchen
,
when
Jones
accost
her
with
a
demand
of
a
gown
and
other
vestment
,
to
cover
the
half
-
naked
woman
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
can
be
more
provoking
to
the
human
temper
,
nor
more
dangerous
to
that
cardinal
virtue
,
patience
,
than
solicitation
of
extraordinary
office
of
kindness
on
behalf
of
those
very
person
with
whom
we
be
highly
incensed
.
<EOS>
for
this
reason
Shakespear
hath
artfully
introduce
his
Desdemona
solicit
favour
for
Cassio
of
her
husband
,
as
the
mean
of
inflaming
,
not
only
his
jealousy
,
but
his
rage
,
to
the
high
pitch
of
madness
;
and
we
find
the
unfortunate
Moor
less
able
to
command
his
passion
on
this
occasion
,
than
even
when
he
behold
his
value
present
to
his
wife
in
the
hand
of
his
suppose
rival
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
we
regard
these
effort
as
insult
on
our
understanding
,
and
to
such
the
pride
of
man
be
very
difficultly
bring
to
submit
.
  
<EOS>
My
landlady
,
though
a
very
good
-
tempered
woman
,
have
,
I
suppose
,
some
of
this
pride
in
her
composition
,
for
Jones
have
scarce
end
his
request
,
when
she
fall
upon
him
with
a
certain
weapon
,
which
,
though
it
be
neither
long
,
nor
sharp
,
nor
hard
,
nor
indeed
threaten
from
its
appearance
with
either
death
or
wound
,
hath
be
however
hold
in
great
dread
and
abhorrence
by
many
wise
man
 
<EOS>
nay
,
by
many
brave
one
;
insomuch
,
that
some
who
have
dare
to
look
into
the
mouth
of
a
load
cannon
,
have
not
dare
to
look
into
a
mouth
where
this
weapon
be
brandish
;
and
rather
than
run
the
hazard
of
its
execution
,
have
content
themselves
with
make
a
most
pitiful
and
sneak
figure
in
the
eye
of
all
their
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
to
confess
the
truth
,
I
be
afraid
Mr
Jones
be
one
of
these
;
for
though
he
be
attack
and
violently
belabour
with
the
aforesaid
weapon
,
he
could
not
be
provoke
to
make
any
resistance
;
but
in
a
most
cowardly
manner
apply
,
with
many
entreaty
,
to
his
antagonist
to
desist
from
pursue
her
blow
;
in
plain
English
,
he
only
beg
her
with
the
utmost
earnestness
to
hear
him
;
but
before
he
could
obtain
his
request
,
my
landlord
himself
enter
into
the
fray
,
and
embrace
that
side
of
the
cause
which
seem
to
stand
very
little
in
need
of
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
sort
of
hero
who
be
suppose
to
be
determine
in
their
chusing
or
avoid
a
conflict
by
the
character
and
behaviour
of
the
person
whom
they
be
to
engage
.
<EOS>
these
be
say
to
know
their
man
,
and
Jones
,
I
believe
,
know
his
woman
;
for
though
he
have
be
so
submissive
to
her
,
he
be
no
sooner
attack
by
her
husband
,
than
he
demonstrate
an
immediate
spirit
of
resentment
,
and
enjoin
him
silence
under
a
very
severe
penalty
;
no
less
than
that
,
I
think
,
of
be
convert
into
fuel
for
his
own
fire
.
  
<EOS>
the
husband
,
with
great
indignation
,
but
with
a
mixture
of
pity
,
answer
,
"
You
must
pray
first
to
be
make
able
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
be
a
well
man
than
yourself
;
ay
,
every
way
,
that
I
be
;
"
and
presently
proceed
to
discharge
half
-
a
-
dozen
whore
at
the
lady
above
stair
,
the
last
of
which
have
scarce
issue
from
his
lip
,
when
a
swinging
blow
from
the
cudgel
that
Jones
carry
in
his
hand
assault
him
over
the
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
question
whether
the
landlord
or
the
landlady
be
the
most
expeditious
in
return
this
blow
.
<EOS>
My
landlord
,
whose
hand
be
empty
,
fall
to
with
his
fist
,
and
the
good
wife
,
uplift
her
broom
and
aim
at
the
head
of
Jones
,
have
probably
put
an
immediate
end
to
the
fray
,
and
to
Jones
likewise
,
have
not
the
descent
of
this
broom
be
prevent
 
not
by
the
miraculous
intervention
of
any
heathen
deity
,
but
by
a
very
natural
though
fortunate
accident
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
by
the
arrival
of
Partridge
;
who
enter
the
house
at
that
instant
(
for
fear
have
cause
him
to
run
every
step
from
the
hill
)
,
and
who
,
see
the
danger
which
threaten
his
master
or
companion
(
which
you
chuse
to
call
him
)
,
prevent
so
sad
a
catastrophe
,
by
catch
hold
of
the
landlady
's
arm
,
as
it
be
brandish
aloft
in
the
air
.
  
<EOS>
the
landlady
soon
perceive
the
impediment
which
prevent
her
blow
;
and
be
unable
to
rescue
her
arm
from
the
hand
of
Partridge
,
she
let
fall
the
broom
;
and
then
leave
Jones
to
the
discipline
of
her
husband
,
she
fall
with
the
utmost
fury
on
that
poor
fellow
,
who
have
already
give
some
intimation
of
himself
,
by
cry
,
"
zounds
!
<EOS>
do
you
intend
to
kill
my
friend
?
"
  
<EOS>
Partridge
,
though
not
much
addict
to
battle
,
would
not
however
stand
still
when
his
friend
be
attack
;
nor
be
he
much
displeased
with
that
part
of
the
combat
which
fall
to
his
share
;
he
therefore
return
my
landlady
's
blow
as
soon
as
he
receive
them
:
and
now
the
fight
be
obstinately
maintain
on
all
part
,
and
it
seem
doubtful
to
which
side
Fortune
would
incline
,
when
the
naked
lady
,
who
have
listen
at
the
top
of
the
stair
to
the
dialogue
which
precede
the
engagement
,
descend
suddenly
from
above
,
and
without
weigh
the
unfair
inequality
of
two
to
one
,
fall
upon
the
poor
woman
who
be
box
with
Partridge
;
nor
do
that
great
champion
desist
,
but
rather
redouble
his
fury
,
when
he
find
fresh
succour
be
arrive
to
his
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
victory
must
now
have
fall
to
the
side
of
the
traveller
(
for
the
brave
troop
must
yield
to
number
)
have
not
Susan
the
chambermaid
come
luckily
to
support
her
mistress
.
<EOS>
this
Susan
be
as
two
-
hand
a
wench
<EOS>
(
accord
to
the
phrase
)
as
any
in
the
country
,
and
would
,
I
believe
,
have
beat
the
famed
Thalestris
herself
,
or
any
of
her
subject
Amazons
;
for
her
form
be
robust
and
man
-
like
,
and
every
way
make
for
such
encounter
.
<EOS>
as
her
hand
and
arm
be
form
to
give
blow
with
great
mischief
to
an
enemy
,
so
be
her
face
as
well
contrived
to
receive
blow
without
any
great
injury
to
herself
,
her
nose
be
already
flat
to
her
face
;
her
lip
be
so
large
,
that
no
swelling
could
be
perceive
in
them
,
and
moreover
they
be
so
hard
,
that
a
fist
could
hardly
make
any
impression
on
them
.
<EOS>
lastly
,
her
cheek
-
bone
stand
out
,
as
if
nature
have
intend
them
for
two
bastion
to
defend
her
eye
in
those
encounter
for
which
she
seem
so
well
calculated
,
and
to
which
she
be
most
wonderfully
well
inclined
.
  
<EOS>
this
fair
creature
enter
the
field
of
battle
,
immediately
file
to
that
wing
where
her
mistress
maintain
so
unequal
a
fight
with
one
of
either
sex
.
<EOS>
here
she
presently
challenge
Partridge
to
single
combat
.
<EOS>
He
accept
the
challenge
,
and
a
most
desperate
fight
begin
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
now
the
dog
of
war
be
let
loose
,
begin
to
lick
their
bloody
lip
;
now
victory
,
with
golden
wing
,
hung
hover
in
the
air
;
now
Fortune
,
take
her
scale
from
her
shelf
,
begin
to
weigh
the
fate
of
Tom
Jones
,
his
female
companion
,
and
Partridge
,
against
the
landlord
,
his
wife
,
and
maid
;
all
which
hang
in
exact
balance
before
her
;
when
a
good
-
natured
accident
put
suddenly
an
end
to
the
bloody
fray
,
with
which
half
of
the
combatant
have
already
sufficiently
feast
.
<EOS>
this
accident
be
the
arrival
of
a
coach
and
four
;
upon
which
my
landlord
and
landlady
immediately
desist
from
fighting
,
and
at
their
entreaty
obtain
the
same
favour
of
their
antagonist
:
but
Susan
be
not
so
kind
to
Partridge
;
for
that
amazonian
fair
have
overthrow
and
bestrid
her
enemy
,
be
now
cuff
him
lustily
with
both
her
hand
,
without
any
regard
to
his
request
of
a
cessation
of
arm
,
or
to
those
loud
exclamation
of
murder
which
he
roar
forth
.
  
<EOS>
no
sooner
,
however
,
have
Jones
quit
the
landlord
,
than
he
fly
to
the
rescue
of
his
defeat
companion
,
from
whom
he
with
much
difficulty
draw
off
the
enraged
chambermaid
:
but
Partridge
be
not
immediately
sensible
of
his
deliverance
,
for
he
still
lie
flat
on
the
floor
,
guard
his
face
with
his
hand
;
nor
do
he
cease
roar
till
Jones
have
force
him
to
look
up
,
and
to
perceive
that
the
battle
be
at
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
the
landlord
,
who
have
no
visible
hurt
,
and
the
landlady
,
hide
her
well
-
scratch
face
with
her
handkerchief
,
run
both
hastily
to
the
door
to
attend
the
coach
,
from
which
a
young
lady
and
her
maid
now
alight
.
<EOS>
these
the
landlady
presently
usher
into
that
room
where
Mr
Jones
have
at
first
deposit
his
fair
prize
,
as
it
be
the
good
apartment
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
hither
they
be
oblige
to
pass
through
the
field
of
battle
,
which
they
do
with
the
utmost
haste
,
cover
their
face
with
their
handkerchief
,
as
desirous
to
avoid
the
notice
of
any
one
.
<EOS>
indeed
their
caution
be
quite
unnecessary
;
for
the
poor
unfortunate
Helen
,
the
fatal
cause
of
all
the
bloodshed
,
be
entirely
take
up
in
endeavour
to
conceal
her
own
face
,
and
Jones
be
no
less
occupied
in
rescue
Partridge
from
the
fury
of
Susan
;
which
be
happily
effect
,
the
poor
fellow
immediately
depart
to
the
pump
to
wash
his
face
,
and
to
stop
that
bloody
torrent
which
Susan
have
plentifully
set
a
-
flow
from
his
nostril
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
the
arrival
of
a
man
of
war
put
a
final
end
to
hostility
,
and
cause
the
conclusion
of
a
firm
and
last
peace
between
all
party
.
 
<EOS>
a
serjeant
and
a
file
of
musqueteer
,
with
a
deserter
in
their
custody
,
arrive
about
this
time
.
<EOS>
the
serjeant
presently
enquire
for
the
principal
magistrate
of
the
town
,
and
be
inform
by
my
landlord
,
that
he
himself
be
vest
in
that
office
.
<EOS>
He
then
demand
his
billet
,
together
with
a
mug
of
beer
,
and
complain
it
be
cold
,
spread
himself
before
the
kitchen
fire
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Jones
be
at
this
time
comfort
the
poor
distressed
lady
,
who
sit
down
at
a
table
in
the
kitchen
,
and
lean
her
head
upon
her
arm
,
be
bemoan
her
misfortune
;
but
lest
my
fair
reader
should
be
in
pain
concern
a
particular
circumstance
,
I
think
proper
here
to
acquaint
them
,
that
before
she
have
quit
the
room
above
stair
,
she
have
so
well
cover
herself
with
a
pillowbeer
which
she
there
find
,
that
her
regard
to
decency
be
not
in
the
least
violate
by
the
presence
of
so
many
man
as
be
now
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
the
soldier
now
go
up
to
the
serjeant
,
and
whisper
something
in
his
ear
;
upon
which
he
stedfastly
fix
his
eye
on
the
lady
,
and
have
look
at
her
for
near
a
minute
,
he
come
up
to
her
,
say
,
"
I
ask
pardon
,
madam
;
but
I
be
certain
I
be
not
deceive
;
you
can
be
no
other
person
than
Captain
Waters
's
lady
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
poor
woman
,
who
in
her
present
distress
have
very
little
regard
the
face
of
any
person
present
,
no
sooner
look
at
the
serjeant
than
she
presently
recollect
him
,
and
call
him
by
his
name
,
answer
,
"
that
she
be
indeed
the
unhappy
person
he
imagine
her
to
be
;
"
but
add
,
"
I
wonder
any
one
should
know
me
in
this
disguise
.
<EOS>
"
to
which
the
serjeant
reply
,
"
He
be
very
much
surprize
to
see
her
ladyship
in
such
a
dress
,
and
be
afraid
some
accident
have
happen
to
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
an
accident
hath
happen
to
me
,
indeed
,
"
say
she
,
"
and
I
be
highly
oblige
to
this
gentleman
"
(
point
to
Jones
)
"
that
it
be
not
a
fatal
one
,
or
that
I
be
now
live
to
mention
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
whatever
the
gentleman
hath
do
,
"
cry
the
serjeant
,
"
<EOS>
I
be
sure
the
captain
will
make
him
amend
for
it
;
and
if
I
can
be
of
any
service
,
your
ladyship
may
command
me
,
and
I
shall
think
myself
very
happy
to
have
it
in
my
power
to
serve
your
ladyship
;
and
so
indeed
may
any
one
,
<EOS>
for
I
know
the
captain
will
well
reward
them
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
landlady
,
who
hear
from
the
stair
all
that
past
between
the
serjeant
and
Mrs
Waters
,
come
hastily
down
,
and
run
directly
up
to
her
,
begin
to
ask
pardon
for
the
offence
she
have
commit
,
beg
that
all
may
be
impute
to
ignorance
of
her
quality
:
for
,
"
Lud
!
<EOS>
madam
<EOS>
,
"
say
she
,
"
how
should
I
have
imagine
that
a
lady
of
your
fashion
would
appear
in
such
a
dress
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
madam
,
if
I
have
once
suspect
that
your
ladyship
be
your
ladyship
,
I
would
sooner
have
burn
my
tongue
out
,
than
have
say
what
I
have
say
;
and
I
hope
your
ladyship
will
accept
of
a
gown
,
till
you
can
get
your
own
cloath
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
prithee
,
woman
,
"
say
Mrs
Waters
,
"
cease
your
impertinence
<EOS>
:
how
can
you
imagine
I
should
concern
myself
about
anything
which
come
from
the
lip
of
such
low
creature
as
yourself
?
<EOS>
but
I
be
surprize
at
your
assurance
in
thinking
,
after
what
be
past
,
that
I
will
condescend
to
put
on
any
of
your
dirty
thing
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
you
know
,
creature
,
I
have
a
spirit
above
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
Jones
interfere
,
and
beg
Mrs
Waters
to
forgive
the
landlady
,
and
to
accept
her
gown
:
"
for
I
must
confess
,
"
cry
he
,
"
our
appearance
be
a
little
suspicious
when
first
we
come
in
;
and
I
be
well
assured
all
this
good
woman
do
be
,
as
she
profess
,
out
of
regard
to
the
reputation
of
her
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
upon
my
truly
be
it
,
"
say
she
:
"
the
gentleman
speak
very
much
like
a
gentleman
,
and
I
see
very
plainly
be
so
;
and
to
be
certain
<EOS>
the
house
be
well
known
to
be
a
house
of
as
good
reputation
as
any
on
the
road
,
and
though
I
say
it
,
be
frequent
by
gentry
of
the
good
quality
,
both
irish
and
English
.
<EOS>
I
defy
anybody
to
say
black
be
my
eye
,
for
that
matter
.
<EOS>
and
,
as
I
be
say
,
if
I
have
know
your
ladyship
to
be
your
ladyship
,
I
would
as
soon
have
burn
my
finger
as
have
affront
your
ladyship
;
but
truly
where
gentry
come
and
spend
their
money
,
I
be
not
willing
that
they
should
be
scandalize
by
a
set
of
poor
shabby
vermin
,
that
,
wherever
they
go
,
leave
more
lice
than
money
behind
them
;
such
folk
never
raise
my
compassion
,
for
to
be
certain
it
be
foolish
to
have
any
for
them
;
and
if
our
justice
do
as
they
ought
,
they
would
be
all
whipt
out
of
the
kingdom
,
for
to
be
certain
it
be
what
be
most
fitting
for
them
.
<EOS>
but
as
for
your
ladyship
,
I
be
heartily
sorry
your
ladyship
hath
have
a
misfortune
,
and
if
your
ladyship
will
do
me
the
honour
to
wear
my
cloath
till
you
can
get
some
of
your
ladyship
's
own
,
to
be
certain
<EOS>
the
good
I
have
be
at
your
ladyship
's
service
.
"
  
<EOS>
whether
cold
,
shame
,
or
the
persuasion
of
Mr
Jones
prevail
most
on
Mrs
Waters
,
I
will
not
determine
,
but
she
suffer
herself
to
be
pacify
by
this
speech
of
my
landlady
,
and
retire
with
that
good
woman
,
in
order
to
apparel
herself
in
a
decent
manner
.
  
<EOS>
My
landlord
be
likewise
begin
his
oration
to
Jones
,
but
be
presently
interrupt
by
that
generous
youth
,
who
shake
him
heartily
by
the
hand
,
and
assure
him
of
entire
forgiveness
,
say
,
"
if
you
be
satisfied
,
my
worthy
friend
,
I
promise
you
I
be
;
"
and
indeed
,
in
one
sense
,
the
landlord
have
the
well
reason
to
be
satisfied
;
for
he
have
receive
a
bellyfull
of
drubbing
,
whereas
Jones
have
scarce
feel
a
single
blow
.
  
<EOS>
Partridge
,
who
have
be
all
this
time
wash
his
bloody
nose
at
the
pump
,
return
into
the
kitchen
at
the
instant
when
his
master
and
the
landlord
be
shake
hand
with
each
other
.
<EOS>
as
he
be
of
a
peaceable
disposition
,
he
be
pleased
with
those
symptom
of
reconciliation
;
and
though
his
face
bear
some
mark
of
Susan
's
fist
,
and
many
more
of
her
nail
,
he
rather
choose
to
be
content
with
his
fortune
in
the
last
battle
than
to
endeavour
at
better
it
in
another
.
  
<EOS>
the
heroic
Susan
be
likewise
well
contented
with
her
victory
,
though
it
have
cost
her
a
black
eye
,
which
Partridge
have
give
her
at
the
first
onset
.
<EOS>
between
these
two
,
therefore
,
a
league
be
strike
,
and
those
hand
which
have
be
the
instrument
of
war
become
now
the
mediator
of
peace
.
  
<EOS>
matter
be
thus
restore
to
a
perfect
calm
;
at
which
the
serjeant
,
though
it
may
seem
so
contrary
to
the
principle
of
his
profession
,
testify
his
approbation
.
<EOS>
"
why
now
,
that
be
friendly
,
"
say
he
;
<EOS>
"
d####n
me
<EOS>
,
I
hate
to
see
two
people
bear
ill
-
will
to
one
another
after
they
have
have
a
tussel
.
<EOS>
the
only
way
when
friend
quarrel
be
to
see
it
out
fairly
in
a
friendly
manner
,
as
a
man
may
call
it
,
either
with
a
fist
,
or
sword
,
or
pistol
,
accord
as
they
like
,
and
then
let
it
be
all
over
;
for
my
own
part
,
d####n
me
<EOS>
if
ever
I
love
my
friend
better
than
when
I
be
fight
with
him
!
<EOS>
to
bear
malice
be
more
like
a
Frenchman
than
an
Englishman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
then
propose
a
libation
as
a
necessary
part
of
the
ceremony
at
all
treaty
of
this
kind
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
reader
may
here
conclude
that
he
be
well
verse
in
antient
history
;
but
this
,
though
highly
probable
,
as
he
cite
no
authority
to
support
the
custom
,
I
will
not
affirm
with
any
confidence
.
<EOS>
most
likely
indeed
it
be
,
that
he
found
his
opinion
on
very
good
authority
,
since
he
confirm
it
with
many
violent
oath
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
no
sooner
hear
the
proposal
than
,
immediately
agree
with
the
learned
serjeant
,
he
order
a
bowl
,
or
rather
a
large
mug
,
fill
with
the
liquor
use
on
these
occasion
,
to
be
bring
in
,
and
then
begin
the
ceremony
himself
.
<EOS>
He
place
his
right
hand
in
that
of
the
landlord
,
and
,
seize
the
bowl
with
his
left
,
utter
the
usual
word
,
and
then
make
his
libation
.
<EOS>
after
which
,
the
same
be
observe
by
all
present
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
there
be
very
little
need
of
be
particular
in
describe
the
whole
form
,
as
it
differ
so
little
from
those
libation
of
which
so
much
be
record
in
antient
author
and
their
modern
transcriber
.
<EOS>
the
principal
difference
lie
in
two
instance
;
for
,
first
,
the
present
company
pour
the
liquor
only
down
their
throat
;
and
,
secondly
,
the
serjeant
,
who
officiate
as
priest
,
drink
the
last
;
but
he
preserve
,
I
believe
,
the
antient
form
,
in
swallow
much
the
large
draught
of
the
whole
company
,
and
in
be
the
only
person
present
who
contribute
nothing
towards
the
libation
besides
his
good
office
in
assist
at
the
performance
.
  
<EOS>
the
good
people
now
range
themselves
round
the
kitchen
fire
,
where
good
humour
seem
to
maintain
an
absolute
dominion
;
and
Partridge
not
only
forget
his
shameful
defeat
,
but
convert
hunger
into
thirst
,
and
soon
become
extremely
facetious
.
<EOS>
We
must
however
quit
this
agreeable
assembly
for
a
while
,
and
attend
Mr
Jones
to
Mrs
Waters
's
apartment
,
where
the
dinner
which
he
have
bespeak
be
now
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
take
no
long
time
in
prepare
,
have
be
all
dr
three
day
before
,
and
require
nothing
more
from
the
cook
than
to
warm
it
over
again
.
    
<EOS>
an
apology
for
all
hero
who
have
good
stomach
,
with
a
description
of
a
battle
of
the
amorous
kind
.
 
<EOS>
Heroes
,
notwithstanding
the
high
idea
which
,
by
the
mean
of
flatterer
,
they
may
entertain
of
themselves
,
or
the
world
may
conceive
of
them
,
have
certainly
more
of
mortal
than
divine
about
them
.
<EOS>
however
elevate
their
mind
may
be
,
their
body
at
least
(
which
be
much
the
major
part
of
most
)
be
liable
to
the
bad
infirmity
,
and
subject
to
the
vile
office
of
human
nature
.
<EOS>
among
these
latter
,
the
act
of
eating
,
which
hath
by
several
wise
man
be
consider
as
extremely
mean
and
derogatory
from
the
philosophic
dignity
,
must
be
in
some
measure
perform
by
the
great
prince
,
heroe
,
or
philosopher
upon
earth
;
nay
,
sometimes
Nature
hath
be
so
frolicsome
as
to
exact
of
these
dignified
character
a
much
more
exorbitant
share
of
this
office
than
she
hath
oblige
those
of
the
low
order
to
perform
.
  
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
as
no
know
inhabitant
of
this
globe
be
really
more
than
man
,
so
none
nee
be
ashamed
of
submit
to
what
the
necessity
of
man
demand
;
but
when
those
great
personage
I
have
just
mention
condescend
to
aim
at
confine
such
low
office
to
themselves
 
as
when
,
by
hoard
or
destroy
,
they
seem
desirous
to
prevent
any
other
from
eat
 
<EOS>
then
they
surely
become
very
low
and
despicable
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
after
this
short
preface
,
we
think
it
no
disparagement
to
our
heroe
to
mention
the
immoderate
ardour
with
which
he
lay
about
him
at
this
season
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
may
be
doubt
whether
Ulysses
,
who
by
the
way
seem
to
have
have
the
good
stomach
of
all
the
hero
in
that
eat
poem
of
the
odyssey
,
ever
make
a
well
meal
.
<EOS>
three
pound
at
least
of
that
flesh
which
formerly
have
contribute
to
the
composition
of
an
ox
be
now
honour
with
become
part
of
the
individual
Mr
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
this
particular
we
think
ourselves
oblige
to
mention
,
as
it
may
account
for
our
heroe
's
temporary
neglect
of
his
fair
companion
,
who
eat
but
very
little
,
and
be
indeed
employ
in
consideration
of
a
very
different
nature
,
which
pass
unobserved
by
Jones
,
till
he
have
entirely
satisfy
that
appetite
<EOS>
which
a
fast
of
twenty
-
four
hour
have
procure
him
;
but
his
dinner
be
no
sooner
end
than
his
attention
to
other
matter
revive
;
with
these
matter
therefore
we
shall
now
proceed
to
acquaint
the
reader
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Jones
,
of
whose
personal
accomplishment
we
have
hitherto
say
very
little
,
be
,
in
reality
,
one
of
the
handsome
young
fellow
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
His
face
,
besides
be
the
picture
of
health
,
have
in
it
the
most
apparent
mark
of
sweetness
and
good
-
nature
.
<EOS>
these
quality
be
indeed
so
characteristical
in
his
countenance
,
that
,
while
the
spirit
and
sensibility
in
his
eye
,
though
they
must
have
be
perceive
by
an
accurate
observer
,
may
have
escape
the
notice
of
the
less
discerning
,
so
strongly
be
this
good
-
nature
paint
in
his
look
,
that
it
be
remark
by
almost
every
one
who
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
,
perhaps
,
as
much
owe
to
this
as
to
a
very
fine
complexion
that
his
face
have
a
delicacy
in
it
almost
inexpressible
,
and
which
may
have
give
him
an
air
rather
too
effeminate
,
have
it
not
be
join
to
a
most
masculine
person
and
mien
:
which
latter
have
as
much
in
them
of
the
Hercules
as
the
former
have
of
the
Adonis
.
<EOS>
He
be
besides
active
,
genteel
,
gay
,
and
good
-
humoured
;
and
have
a
flow
of
animal
spirit
which
enliven
every
conversation
where
he
be
present
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
reader
hath
duly
reflect
on
these
many
charm
which
all
center
in
our
heroe
,
and
consider
at
the
same
time
the
fresh
obligation
which
Mrs
Waters
have
to
him
,
it
will
be
a
mark
more
of
prudery
than
candour
to
entertain
a
bad
opinion
of
her
because
she
conceive
a
very
good
opinion
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
whatever
censure
may
be
pass
upon
her
,
it
be
my
business
to
relate
matter
of
fact
with
veracity
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Waters
have
,
in
truth
,
not
only
a
good
opinion
of
our
heroe
,
but
a
very
great
affection
for
him
.
<EOS>
to
speak
out
boldly
at
once
,
she
be
in
love
,
accord
to
the
present
universally
-
receive
sense
of
that
phrase
,
by
which
love
be
apply
indiscriminately
to
the
desirable
object
of
all
our
passion
,
appetite
,
and
sense
,
and
be
understand
to
be
that
preference
which
we
give
to
one
kind
of
food
rather
than
to
another
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
the
love
to
these
several
object
may
possibly
be
one
and
the
same
in
all
case
,
its
operation
however
must
be
allow
to
be
different
;
for
,
how
much
soever
we
may
be
in
love
with
an
excellent
surloin
of
beef
,
or
bottle
of
Burgundy
;
with
a
damask
rise
,
or
Cremona
fiddle
;
yet
do
we
never
smile
,
nor
ogle
,
nor
dress
,
nor
flat
,
nor
endeavour
by
any
other
art
or
trick
to
gain
the
affection
of
the
said
beef
,
&
c.
Sigh
<EOS>
indeed
we
sometimes
may
;
but
it
be
generally
in
the
absence
,
not
in
the
presence
,
of
the
beloved
object
.
<EOS>
for
otherwise
we
may
possibly
complain
of
their
ingratitude
and
deafness
,
with
the
same
reason
as
Pasiphae
doth
of
her
bull
,
whom
she
endeavour
to
engage
by
all
the
coquetry
practise
with
good
success
in
the
drawing
-
room
on
the
much
more
sensible
as
well
as
tender
heart
of
the
fine
gentleman
there
.
  
<EOS>
the
contrary
happen
in
that
love
which
operate
between
person
of
the
same
specie
,
but
of
different
sex
.
<EOS>
here
we
be
no
sooner
in
love
than
it
become
our
principal
care
to
engage
the
affection
of
the
object
beloved
.
<EOS>
for
what
other
purpose
indeed
be
our
youth
instruct
in
all
the
art
of
render
themselves
agreeable
?
<EOS>
if
it
be
not
with
a
view
to
this
love
,
I
question
whether
any
of
those
trade
which
deal
in
set
off
and
adorn
the
human
person
would
procure
a
livelihood
.
<EOS>
nay
,
those
great
polisher
of
our
manner
,
who
be
by
some
thought
to
teach
what
principally
distinguish
us
from
the
brute
creation
,
even
dancing
-
master
themselves
,
may
possibly
find
no
place
in
society
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
all
the
grace
which
young
lady
and
young
gentleman
too
learn
from
other
,
and
the
many
improvement
which
,
by
the
help
of
a
looking
-
glass
,
they
add
of
their
own
,
be
in
reality
those
very
spicula
et
face
amoris
so
often
mention
by
Ovid
;
or
,
as
they
be
sometimes
call
in
our
own
language
,
the
whole
artillery
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
now
Mrs
Waters
and
our
heroe
have
no
sooner
sit
down
together
than
the
former
begin
to
play
this
artillery
upon
the
latter
.
<EOS>
but
here
,
as
we
be
about
to
attempt
a
description
hitherto
unassayed
either
in
prose
or
verse
,
we
think
proper
to
invoke
the
assistance
of
certain
aerial
being
,
who
will
,
we
doubt
not
,
come
kindly
to
our
aid
on
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
say
then
,
ye
Graces
!
<EOS>
you
that
inhabit
the
heavenly
mansion
of
Seraphina
's
countenance
;
for
you
be
truly
divine
,
be
always
in
her
presence
,
and
well
know
all
the
art
of
charming
;
say
,
what
be
the
weapon
now
use
to
captivate
the
heart
of
Mr
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
first
,
from
two
lovely
blue
eye
,
whose
bright
orb
flash
lightning
at
their
discharge
,
fly
forth
two
pointed
ogle
;
but
,
happily
for
our
heroe
,
hit
only
a
vast
piece
of
beef
which
he
be
then
convey
into
his
plate
,
and
harmless
spend
their
force
.
<EOS>
the
fair
warrior
perceive
their
miscarriage
,
and
immediately
from
her
fair
bosom
draw
forth
a
deadly
sigh
.
<EOS>
a
sigh
which
none
could
have
hear
unmoved
,
and
which
be
sufficient
at
once
to
have
sweep
off
a
dozen
beaus
;
so
soft
,
so
sweet
,
so
tender
,
that
the
insinuating
air
must
have
find
its
subtle
way
to
the
heart
of
our
heroe
,
have
it
not
luckily
be
drive
from
his
ear
by
the
coarse
bubbling
of
some
bottled
ale
,
which
at
that
time
he
be
pour
forth
.
<EOS>
many
other
weapon
do
she
assay
;
but
the
god
of
eat
(
if
there
be
any
such
deity
,
for
I
do
not
confidently
assert
it
)
preserve
his
votary
;
or
perhaps
it
may
not
be
dignus
vindice
nodus
,
and
the
present
security
of
Jones
may
be
account
for
by
natural
mean
;
for
as
love
frequently
preserve
from
the
attack
of
hunger
,
so
may
hunger
possibly
,
in
some
case
,
defend
us
against
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
fair
one
,
enrage
at
her
frequent
disappointment
,
determine
on
a
short
cessation
of
arm
.
<EOS>
which
interval
she
employ
in
make
ready
every
engine
of
amorous
warfare
for
the
renewing
of
the
attack
when
dinner
should
be
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
sooner
then
be
the
cloth
remove
than
she
again
begin
her
operation
.
<EOS>
first
,
have
plant
her
right
eye
sidewise
against
Mr
Jones
,
she
shoot
from
its
corner
a
most
penetrating
glance
;
which
,
though
great
part
of
its
force
be
spend
before
it
reach
our
heroe
,
do
not
vent
itself
absolutely
without
effect
.
<EOS>
this
the
fair
one
perceiving
,
hastily
withdraw
her
eye
,
and
level
them
downwards
,
as
if
she
be
concern
for
what
she
have
do
;
though
by
this
mean
she
design
only
to
draw
him
from
his
guard
,
and
indeed
to
open
his
eye
,
through
which
she
intend
to
surprize
his
heart
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
gently
lift
up
those
two
bright
orb
which
have
already
begin
to
make
an
impression
on
poor
Jones
,
she
discharge
a
volley
of
small
charm
at
once
from
her
whole
countenance
in
a
smile
.
<EOS>
not
a
smile
of
mirth
,
nor
of
joy
;
but
a
smile
of
affection
,
which
most
lady
have
always
ready
at
their
command
,
and
which
serve
them
to
show
at
once
their
good
-
humour
,
their
pretty
dimple
,
and
their
white
tooth
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
smile
our
heroe
receive
full
in
his
eye
,
and
be
immediately
stagger
with
its
force
.
<EOS>
He
then
begin
to
see
the
design
of
the
enemy
,
and
indeed
to
feel
their
success
.
<EOS>
a
parley
now
be
set
on
foot
between
the
party
;
during
which
the
artful
fair
so
slily
and
imperceptibly
carry
on
her
attack
,
that
she
have
almost
subdue
the
heart
of
our
heroe
before
she
again
repair
to
act
of
hostility
.
<EOS>
to
confess
the
truth
,
I
be
afraid
Mr
Jones
maintain
a
kind
of
dutch
defence
,
and
treacherously
deliver
up
the
garrison
,
without
duly
weigh
his
allegiance
to
the
fair
Sophia
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
no
sooner
have
the
amorous
parley
end
and
the
lady
have
unmask
the
royal
battery
,
by
carelessly
let
her
handkerchief
drop
from
her
neck
,
than
the
heart
of
Mr
Jones
be
entirely
take
,
and
the
fair
conqueror
enjoy
the
usual
fruit
of
her
victory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
the
grace
think
proper
to
end
their
description
,
and
here
we
think
proper
to
end
the
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
a
friendly
conversation
in
the
kitchen
,
which
have
a
very
common
,
though
not
very
friendly
,
conclusion
.
 
<EOS>
while
our
lover
be
entertain
themselves
in
the
manner
which
be
partly
describe
in
the
foregoing
chapter
,
they
be
likewise
furnish
out
an
entertainment
for
their
good
friend
in
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
and
this
in
a
double
sense
,
by
afford
them
matter
for
their
conversation
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
drink
to
enliven
their
spirit

<EOS>
there
be
now
assemble
round
the
kitchen
fire
,
besides
my
landlord
and
landlady
,
who
occasionally
go
backward
and
forward
,
Mr
Partridge
,
the
serjeant
,
and
the
coachman
who
drive
the
young
lady
and
her
maid
.
  
<EOS>
partridge
have
acquaint
the
company
with
what
he
have
learn
from
the
Man
of
the
Hill
concern
the
situation
in
which
Mrs
Waters
have
be
find
by
Jones
,
<EOS>
the
serjeant
proceed
to
that
part
of
her
history
which
be
know
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
say
she
be
the
wife
of
Mr
Waters
,
who
be
a
captain
in
their
regiment
,
and
have
often
be
with
him
at
quarter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
some
folk
,
"
say
he
,
"
use
indeed
to
doubt
whether
they
be
lawfully
married
in
a
church
or
no
.
<EOS>
but
,
for
my
part
,
that
be
no
business
of
mine

:
I
must
own
,
if
I
be
put
to
my
corporal
oath
,
I
believe
she
be
little
well
than
one
of
us
;

I
fancy
the
captain
may
go
to
heaven
when
the
sun
shine
upon
a
rainy
day
.
<EOS>
but
if
he
do
,
that
is
neither
here
nor
there

for
he
will
not
want
company

<EOS>
and
the
lady
,
to
give
the
devil
his
due
,
be
a
very
good
sort
of
lady
,
and
love
the
cloth

be
always
desirous
to
do
strict
justice
to
it

she
hath
beg
off
many
a
poor
soldier
,
and
,
by
her
good
-
will
,
would
never
have
any
of
them
punish
.
<EOS>
but
yet
,
to
be
sure
,
Ensign
Northerton
and
she
be
very
well
acquaint
together
at
our
last
quarter
;
that
be
the
very
right
and
truth
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
but
the
captain
he
know
nothing
about
it
;

as
long
as
there
be
enough
for
him
too

what
do
it
signify
?
<EOS>
He
love
her
not
a
bit
the
bad
,
and
I
be
certain
would
run
any
man
through
the
body
that
be
to
abuse
her
;
therefore
I
will
not
abuse
her
,
for
my
part

<EOS>
I
only
repeat
what
other
folk
say
;

,
to
be
certain

what
everybody
say

there
must
be
some
truth
in

We
meet
with

"
I
will
be

you

it

I

not

perhaps
he
may
have

pray
what

I
have
hear
some

there
be
no

that
it

only
a
trick

those

I

<EOS>

to

I

there
must

will
find
there

I

I
do
not

off

roast
cabbage

dinner

wretch

curse

You
be

rascal

I

prove
it

"
<EOS>
this
challenge
effectually
silence
Partridge

whose
stomach
for
drubbing
do
not
so
soon
return
after
the
hearty
meal
which
he
have
lately
be
treat
with
;
but
the
coachman
,
whose
bone
be
less
sore
,
and
whose
appetite
for
fighting
be
somewhat
sharp
,
do
not
so
easily
brook
the
affront
,
of
which
he
conceive
some
part
at

fall
to
his
share

<EOS>
He
start
therefore
from
his
seat

and
,
advance
to
the
serjeant
,
swear
he
look
on
himself
to
be
as
good
a
man
as
any
in
the
army
,
and
offer
to
box
for
a
guinea
.
<EOS>
the
military
man
accept
the
combat
,
but
refuse
the
wager
;
upon
which
both
immediately
stript
and
engage
,
till
the
driver
of

be
so
well
maul

the

<EOS>
this
word
,
which
the
serjeant
unhappily
mistake
for
an
affront
,
  
be
a
term
in
logic
,
and
mean
that
the
conclusion
do
not
follow
  
from
the
premise
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
lady
be
now
desirous
to
depart
,
and
have
give
order
for
her
coach
to
be
prepare
;
but
all
in
vain
,
for
the
coachman
be
disabled
from
perform
his
office
for
that
evening
.
<EOS>
an
antient
heathen
would
perhaps
have
impute
this
disability
to
the
god
of
drink
,
no
less
than
to
the
god
of
war
;
for
,
in
reality
,
both
the
combatant
have
sacrifice
as
well
to
the
former
deity
as
to
the
latter
.
<EOS>
to
speak
plainly
,
they
be
both
dead
drunk
,
nor
be
Partridge
in
a
much
well
situation
.
<EOS>
as
for
my
landlord
,
drinking
be
his
trade
;
and
the
liquor
have
no
more
effect
on
him
than
it
have
on
any
other
vessel
in
his
house

<EOS>
the
mistress
of

inn

be
summon
to
attend
Mr
Jones
and
his
companion
at
their
tea
,
give
a
full
relation
of
the
latter
part
of
the
foregoing
scene

at
the

time
express
great
concern

away
from

know

some
young
gentleman

other
may
be
expect
her
,
with
a
heart
as
heavy
as
her
own
?
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
fetch
a
heavy
sigh
at
those
word
;
of
which
,
though
Mrs
Waters
observe
it
,
she
take
no
notice
while
the
landlady
continue
in
the
room
;
but
,
after
the
departure
of
that
good
woman
,
she
could
not
forbear
give
our
heroe
certain
hint
on
her
suspect
some
very
dangerous
rival
in
his
affection
.
<EOS>
the
aukward
behaviour
of
Mr
Jones
on
this
occasion
convince
her
of
the
truth
,
without
his
give
her
a
direct
answer
to
any
of
her
question
;
but
she
be
not
nice
enough
in
her
amour
to
be
greatly
concerned
at
the
discovery
.
<EOS>
the
beauty
of
Jones
highly
charm
her
eye
;
but
as
she
could
not
see
his
heart
,
she
give
herself
no
concern
about
it
.
<EOS>
She
could
feast
heartily
at
the
table
of
love
,
without
reflect
that
some
other
already
have
be
,
or
hereafter
may
be
,
feast
with
the
same
repast
.
<EOS>
a
sentiment
which
,
if
it
deal
but
little
in
refinement
,
deal
,
however
,
much
in
substance
;
and
be
less
capricious
,
and
perhaps
less
ill
-
natured
and
selfish
,
than
the
desire
of
those
female
who
can
be
content
enough
to
abstain
from
the
possession
of
their
lover
,
provide
they
be
sufficiently
satisfied
that
no
one
else
possess
them
.
    
<EOS>
contain
a
full
account
of
Mrs
Waters
,
and
by
what
mean
she
come
into
that
distressful
situation
from
which
she
be
rescue
by
Jones
.
 
<EOS>
though
nature
hath
by
no
means
mix
up
an
equal
share
either
of
curiosity
or
vanity
in
every
human
composition
,
there
be
perhaps
no
individual
to
whom
she
hath
not
allot
such
a
proportion
of
both
as
require
much
art
,
and
pain
too
,
to
subdue

keep
under
;
 
a
conquest

absolutely
necessary

would
in
any
degree
deserve
the
character
of
wisdom

good
breeding

<EOS>
as
Jones

may
very
justly
be
call
a
well

breed
man

he
have
stifle
all
that
curiosity
which
the
extraordinary
manner
in
which
he
have
find
Mrs
Waters
must
be
suppose
to
have
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
indeed
,
at
first
throw
out
some
few
hint
to
the
lady
;
but
,
when
he
perceive
her
industriously
avoid
any
explanation
,
he
be
content
to
remain
in
ignorance
,
the
rather
as
he
be
not
without
suspicion
that
there
be
some
circumstance
which
must
have
raise
her
blush
,
have
she
relate
the
whole
truth
.
  
<EOS>
now
since
it
be
possible
that
some
of
our
reader
may
not
so
easily
acquiesce
under
the
same
ignorance
,
and
as
we
be
very
desirous
to
satisfy
them
all
,
we
have
take
uncommon
pain
to
inform
ourselves
of
the
real
fact
,
with
the
relation
of
which
we
shall
conclude
this
book
.
  
<EOS>
this
lady
,
then
,
have
live
some
year
with
one
Captain
Waters
,
who
be
a
captain
in
the
same
regiment
to
which
Mr
Northerton
belong
.
<EOS>
She
past
for
that
gentleman
's
wife
,
and
go
by
his
name
;
and
yet
,
as
the
serjeant
say
,
there
be
some
doubt
concern
the
reality
of
their
marriage
,
which
we
shall
not
at
present
take
upon
us
to
resolve
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Waters
,
I
be
sorry
to
say
it
,
have
for
some
time
contract
an
intimacy
with
the
above
-
mention
ensign
,
which
do
no
great
credit
to
her
reputation
.
<EOS>
that
she
have
a
remarkable
fondness
for
that
young
fellow
be
most
certain
;
but
whether
she
indulge
this
to
any
very
criminal
length
be
not
so
extremely
clear
,
unless
we
will
suppose
that
woman
never
grant
every
favour
to
a
man
but
one
,
without
grant
him
that
one
also
.
  
<EOS>
the
division
of
the
regiment
to
which
Captain
Waters
belong
have
two
day
precede
the
march
of
that
company
to
which
Mr
Northerton
be
the
ensign
;
so
that
the
former
have
reach
Worcester
the
very
day
after
the
unfortunate
re
-
encounter
between
Jones
and
Northerton
which
we
have
before
record
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
it
have
be
agree
between
Mrs
Waters
and
the
captain
that
she
would
accompany
him
in
his
march
as
far
as
Worcester
,
where
they
be
to
take
their
leave
of
each
other
,
and
she
be
thence
to
return
to
Bath
,
where
she
be
to
stay
till
the
end
of
the
winter
's
campaign
against
the
rebel
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
agreement
Mr
Northerton
be
make
acquainted
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
the
lady
have
make
him
an
assignation
at
this
very
place
,
and
promise
to
stay
at
Worcester
till
his
division
come
thither
;
with
what
view
,
and
for
what
purpose
,
must
be
leave
to
the
reader
's
divination
;
for
,
though
we
be
oblige
to
relate
fact
,
we
be
not
oblige
to
do
a
violence
to
our
nature
by
any
comment
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
lovely
part
of
the
creation
.
  
<EOS>
Northerton
no
sooner
obtain
a
release
from
his
captivity
,
as
we
have
see
,
than
he
haste
away
to
overtake
Mrs
Waters
;
which
,
as
he
be
a
very
active
nimble
fellow
,
he
do
at
the
last
-
mention
city
,
some
few
hour
after
Captain
Waters
have
leave
her
.
<EOS>
at
his
first
arrival
he
make
no
scruple
of
acquaint
her
with
the
unfortunate
accident
;
which
he
make
appear
very
unfortunate
indeed
,
for
he
totally
extract
every
particle
of
what
could
be
call
fault
,
at
least
in
a
court
of
honour
,
though
he
leave
some
circumstance
which
may
be
questionable
in
a
court
of
law
.
  
<EOS>
woman
,
to
their
glory
be
it
speak
,
be
more
generally
capable
of
that
violent
and
apparently
disintereste
passion
of
love
,
which
seek
only
the
good
of
its
object
,
than
man
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Waters
,
therefore
,
be
no
sooner
apprize
of
the
danger
to
which
her
lover
be
expose
,
than
she
lose
every
consideration
besides
that
of
his
safety
;
and
this
be
a
matter
equally
agreeable
to
the
gentleman
,
it
become
the
immediate
subject
of
debate
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
after
much
consultation
on
this
matter
,
it
be
at
length
agree
that
the
ensign
should
go
across
the
country
to
Hereford
,
whence
he
may
find
some
conveyance
to
one
of
the
sea
-
port
in
Wales
,
and
thence
may
make
his
escape
abroad
.
<EOS>
in
all
which
expedition
<EOS>
Mrs
Waters
declare
she
would
bear
him
company
;
and
for
which
she
be
able
to
furnish
him
with
money
,
a
very
material
article
to
Mr
Northerton
,
she
have
then
in
her
pocket
<EOS>
three
bank
-
note
to
the
amount
of
L90
,
besides
some
cash
,
and
a
diamond
ring
of
pretty
considerable
value
on
her
finger
.
<EOS>
all
which
she
,
with
the
utmost
confidence
,
reveal
to
this
wicked
man
,
little
suspecting
she
should
by
these
mean
inspire
him
with
a
design
of
rob
her
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
they
must
,
by
take
horse
from
Worcester
,
have
furnish
any
pursuer
with
the
mean
of
hereafter
discover
their
route
,
the
ensign
propose
,
and
the
lady
presently
agree
,
to
make
their
first
stage
on
foot
;
for
which
purpose
the
hardness
of
the
frost
be
very
seasonable
.
  
<EOS>
the
main
part
of
the
lady
's
baggage
be
already
at
Bath
,
and
she
have
nothing
with
her
at
present
besides
a
very
small
quantity
of
linen
,
which
the
gallant
undertake
to
carry
in
his
own
pocket
.
<EOS>
all
thing
,
therefore
,
be
settle
in
the
evening
,
they
arise
early
the
next
morning
,
and
at
five
o'clock
depart
from
Worcester
,
it
be
then
above
two
hour
before
day
,
but
the
moon
,
which
be
then
at
the
full
,
give
them
all
the
light
she
be
capable
of
afford
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Waters
be
not
of
that
delicate
race
of
woman
who
be
oblige
to
the
invention
of
vehicle
for
the
capacity
of
remove
themselves
from
one
place
to
another
,
and
with
whom
consequently
a
coach
be
reckon
among
the
necessary
of
life
.
<EOS>
Her
limb
be
indeed
full
of
strength
and
agility
,
and
,
as
her
mind
be
no
less
animated
with
spirit
,
she
be
perfectly
able
to
keep
pace
with
her
nimble
lover
.
  
<EOS>
have
travel
on
for
some
mile
in
a
high
road
,
which
Northerton
say
he
be
inform
lead
to
Hereford
,
they
come
at
the
break
of
day
to
the
side
of
a
large
wood
,
where
he
suddenly
stop
,
and
,
affect
to
meditate
a
moment
with
himself
,
express
some
apprehension
from
travel
any
longer
in
so
public
a
way
.
<EOS>
upon
which
he
easily
persuade
his
fair
companion
to
strike
with
him
into
a
path
which
seem
to
lead
directly
through
the
wood
,
and
which
at
length
bring
them
both
to
the
bottom
of
Mazard
Hill
.
  
<EOS>
whether
the
execrable
scheme
which
he
now
attempt
to
execute
be
the
effect
of
previous
deliberation
,
or
whether
it
now
first
come
into
his
head
,
I
can
not
determine
.
<EOS>
but
be
arrive
in
this
lonely
place
,
where
it
be
very
improbable
he
should
meet
with
any
interruption
,
he
suddenly
slip
his
garter
from
his
leg
,
and
,
lay
violent
hand
on
the
poor
woman
,
endeavour
to
perpetrate
that
dreadful
and
detestable
fact
which
we
have
before
commemorate
,
and
which
the
providential
appearance
of
Jones
<EOS>
do
so
fortunately
prevent
.
  
<EOS>
Happy
be
it
for
Mrs
Waters
that
she
be
not
of
the
weak
order
of
female
;
for
no
sooner
do
she
perceive
,
by
his
tie
a
knot
in
his
garter
,
and
by
his
declaration
,
what
his
hellish
intention
be
,
than
she
stand
stoutly
to
her
defence
,
and
so
strongly
struggle
with
her
enemy
,
scream
all
the
while
for
assistance
,
that
she
delay
the
execution
of
the
villain
's
purpose
several
minute
,
by
which
mean
Mr
Jones
come
to
her
relief
at
that
very
instant
when
her
strength
fail
<EOS>
and
she
be
totally
overpower
,
and
deliver
her
from
the
ruffian
's
hand
,
with
no
other
loss
than
that
of
her
cloath
,
which
be
tear
from
her
back
,
and
of
the
diamond
ring
,
which
during
the
contention
either
drop
from
her
finger
,
or
be
wrench
from
it
by
Northerton
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
reader
,
we
have
give
thee
the
fruit
of
a
very
painful
enquiry
which
for
thy
satisfaction
we
have
make
into
this
matter
.
<EOS>
and
here
we
have
open
to
thee
a
scene
of
folly
as
well
as
villany
,
which
we
could
scarce
<EOS>
have
believe
a
human
creature
capable
of
be
guilty
of
,
have
we
not
remember
that
this
fellow
be
at
that
time
firmly
persuade
that
he
have
already
commit
a
murder
,
and
have
forfeit
his
life
to
the
law
.
<EOS>
as
he
conclude
therefore
that
his
only
safety
lie
in
flight
,
he
think
the
possess
himself
of
this
poor
woman
's
money
and
ring
would
make
him
amend
for
the
additional
burthen
<EOS>
he
be
to
lay
on
his
conscience
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
,
reader
,
we
must
strictly
caution
thee
that
thou
dost
not
take
any
occasion
,
from
the
misbehaviour
of
such
a
wretch
as
this
,
to
reflect
on
so
worthy
and
honourable
a
body
of
man
as
be
the
officer
of
our
army
in
general
.
<EOS>
Thou
wilt
be
pleased
to
consider
that
this
fellow
,
as
we
have
already
inform
thee
,
have
neither
the
birth
nor
education
of
a
gentleman
,
nor
be
a
proper
person
to
be
enrol
among
the
number
of
such
.
<EOS>
if
,
therefore
,
his
baseness
can
justly
reflect
on
any
besides
himself
,
it
must
be
only
on
those
who
give
him
his
commission
.
  
<EOS>
BOOK
X.
  
in
WHICH
the
history
go
FORWARD
about
twelve
hours
.
    
<EOS>
contain
instruction
very
necessary
to
be
peruse
by
modern
critic
.
 
<EOS>
Reader
,
it
be
impossible
we
should
know
what
sort
of
person
thou
wilt
be
;
for
,
perhaps
,
thou
may'st
be
as
learn
in
human
nature
as
Shakespear
himself
be
,
and
,
perhaps
,
thou
may'st
be
no
wise
than
some
of
his
editor
.
<EOS>
now
,
lest
this
latter
should
be
the
case
,
we
think
proper
,
before
we
go
any
farther
together
,
to
give
thee
a
few
wholesome
admonition
;
that
thou
may'st
not
as
grossly
misunderstand
and
misrepresent
us
,
<EOS>
as
some
of
the
say
editor
have
misunderstood
and
misrepresent
their
author
.
  
<EOS>
first
,
then
,
we
warn
thee
not
too
hastily
to
condemn
any
of
the
incident
in
this
our
history
as
impertinent
and
foreign
to
our
main
design
,
because
thou
dost
not
immediately
conceive
in
what
manner
such
incident
may
conduce
to
that
design
.
<EOS>
this
work
may
,
indeed
,
be
consider
as
a
great
creation
of
our
own
;
and
for
a
little
reptile
of
a
critic
to
presume
to
find
fault
with
any
of
its
part
,
without
know
the
manner
in
which
the
whole
be
connect
,
and
before
he
come
to
the
final
catastrophe
,
be
a
most
presumptuous
absurdity
.
<EOS>
the
allusion
and
metaphor
we
have
here
make
use
of
,
we
must
acknowledge
to
be
infinitely
too
great
for
our
occasion
;
but
there
be
,
indeed
,
no
other
,
which
be
at
all
adequate
to
express
the
difference
between
an
author
of
the
first
rate
and
a
critic
of
the
low
.
  
<EOS>
another
caution
we
would
give
thee
,
my
good
reptile
,
be
,
that
thou
dost
not
find
out
too
near
a
resemblance
between
certain
character
here
introduce
;
as
,
for
instance
,
between
the
landlady
who
appear
in
the
seventh
book
and
her
in
the
ninth
.
<EOS>
Thou
art
to
know
,
friend
,
that
there
be
certain
characteristic
in
which
most
individual
of
every
profession
and
occupation
agree
.
<EOS>
to
be
able
to
preserve
these
characteristic
,
and
at
the
same
time
to
diversify
their
operation
,
be
one
talent
of
a
good
writer
.
<EOS>
again
,
to
mark
the
nice
distinction
between
two
person
actuate
by
the
same
vice
or
folly
be
another
;
and
,
as
this
last
talent
be
find
in
very
few
writer
,
so
be
the
true
discernment
of
it
find
in
as
few
reader
;
though
,
I
believe
,
the
observation
of
this
form
a
very
principal
pleasure
in
those
who
be
capable
of
the
discovery
;
every
person
,
for
instance
,
can
distinguish
between
Sir
Epicure
Mammon
and
Sir
Fopling
Flutter
;
but
to
note
the
difference
between
Sir
Fopling
Flutter
and
Sir
courtly
Nice
require
a
more
exquisite
judgment
:
for
want
of
which
,
vulgar
spectator
of
play
very
often
do
great
injustice
in
the
theatre
;
where
I
have
sometimes
know
a
poet
in
danger
of
be
convict
as
a
thief
,
upon
much
bad
evidence
than
the
resemblance
of
hand
<EOS>
hath
be
hold
to
be
in
the
law
.
<EOS>
in
reality
,
I
apprehend
every
amorous
widow
on
the
stage
would
run
the
hazard
of
be
condemn
as
a
servile
imitation
of
Dido
,
but
that
happily
very
few
of
our
play
-
house
critic
understand
enough
of
Latin
to
read
Virgil
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
next
place
,
we
must
admonish
thee
,
my
worthy
friend
(
for
,
perhaps
,
thy
heart
may
be
well
than
thy
head
)
,
not
to
condemn
a
character
as
a
bad
one
,
because
it
be
not
perfectly
a
good
one
.
<EOS>
if
thou
dost
delight
in
these
model
of
perfection
,
there
be
book
enow
write
to
gratify
thy
taste
;
but
,
as
we
have
not
,
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
,
ever
happen
to
meet
with
any
such
person
,
we
have
not
choose
to
introduce
any
such
here
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
I
a
little
question
whether
mere
man
ever
arrive
at
this
consummate
degree
of
excellence
,
as
well
as
whether
there
hath
ever
exist
a
monster
bad
enough
to
verify
that
   
nulla
virtute
redemptum
       
<EOS>
a
vitiis
 
<EOS>
[
*
]
    
[
*
]
whose
vice
be
not
allay
with
a
single
virtue
  
in
Juvenal
;
nor
do
I
,
indeed
,
conceive
the
good
purpose
serve
by
insert
character
of
such
angelic
perfection
,
or
such
diabolical
depravity
,
in
any
work
of
invention
;
since
,
from
contemplate
either
,
the
mind
of
man
be
more
likely
to
be
overwhelm
with
sorrow
and
shame
than
to
draw
any
good
use
from
such
pattern
;
for
in
the
former
instance
he
may
be
both
concerned
and
ashamed
to
see
a
pattern
of
excellence
in
his
nature
,
which
he
may
reasonably
despair
of
ever
arrive
at
;
and
in
contemplate
the
latter
he
may
be
no
less
affected
with
those
uneasy
sensation
,
at
see
the
nature
of
which
he
be
a
partaker
degrade
into
so
odious
and
detestable
a
creature
.
  
<EOS>
in
fact
,
if
there
be
enough
of
goodness
in
a
character
to
engage
the
admiration
and
affection
of
a
well
-
dispose
mind
,
though
there
should
appear
some
of
those
little
blemish
quas
humana
parum
cavit
natura
,
they
will
raise
our
compassion
rather
than
our
abhorrence
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
nothing
can
be
of
more
moral
use
than
the
imperfection
which
be
see
in
example
of
this
kind
;
since
such
form
a
kind
of
surprize
,
more
apt
to
affect
and
dwell
upon
our
mind
than
the
fault
of
very
vicious
and
wicked
person
.
<EOS>
the
foible
and
vice
of
man
,
in
whom
there
be
great
mixture
of
good
,
become
more
glaring
object
from
the
virtue
which
contrast
them
and
shew
their
deformity
;
and
when
we
find
such
vice
attend
with
their
evil
consequence
to
our
favourite
character
,
we
be
not
only
teach
to
shun
them
for
our
own
sake
,
but
to
hate
them
for
the
mischief
they
have
already
bring
on
those
we
love
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
my
friend
,
have
give
you
these
few
admonition
,
we
will
,
if
you
please
,
once
more
set
forward
with
our
history
.
    
<EOS>
contain
the
arrival
of
an
irish
gentleman
,
with
very
extraordinary
adventure
which
ensue
at
the
inn
.
 
<EOS>
now
the
little
trembling
hare
,
which
the
dread
of
all
her
numerous
enemy
,
and
chiefly
of
that
cunning
,
cruel
,
carnivorous
animal
,
man
,
have
confine
all
the
day
to
her
lurking
-
place
,
sport
wantonly
o'er
the
lawn
;
now
on
some
hollow
tree
<EOS>
the
owl
,
shrill
chorister
of
the
night
,
hoot
forth
note
which
may
charm
the
ear
of
some
modern
connoisseur
in
music
;
now
,
in
the
imagination
of
the
half
-
drunk
clown
,
as
he
stagger
through
the
churchyard
,
or
rather
charnelyard
,
to
his
home
,
fear
paint
the
bloody
hobgoblin
;
now
thief
and
ruffian
be
awake
,
and
honest
watchman
fast
asleep
;
in
plain
English
,
it
be
now
midnight
;
and
the
company
at
the
inn
,
as
well
those
who
have
be
already
mention
in
this
history
,
as
some
other
who
arrive
in
the
evening
,
be
all
in
bed
.
<EOS>
only
Susan
Chambermaid
be
now
stir
,
she
be
oblige
to
wash
the
kitchen
before
she
retire
to
the
arm
of
the
fond
expecting
hostler
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
posture
be
affair
at
the
inn
when
a
gentleman
arrive
there
post
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
alight
from
his
horse
,
and
,
come
up
to
Susan
,
enquire
of
her
,
in
a
very
abrupt
and
confused
manner
,
be
almost
out
of
breath
with
eagerness
,
whether
there
be
any
lady
in
the
house
?
<EOS>
the
hour
of
night
,
and
the
behaviour
of
the
man
,
who
stare
very
wildly
all
the
time
,
a
little
surprize
Susan
,
so
that
she
hesitate
before
she
make
any
answer
;
upon
which
the
gentleman
,
with
redouble
eagerness
,
beg
her
to
give
him
a
true
information
,
say
,
He
have
lose
his
wife
,
and
be
come
in
pursuit
of
her
.
"
<EOS>
upon
my
shoul
,
"
cry
he
,
"
I
have
be
near
catch
her
already
in
two
or
three
place
,
if
I
have
not
find
her
go
just
as
I
come
up
with
her
.
<EOS>
if
she
be
in
the
house
,
do
carry
me
up
in
the
dark
and
show
her
to
me
;
and
if
she
be
go
away
before
me
,
do
tell
me
which
way
I
shall
go
after
her
to
meet
her
,
and
,
upon
my
shoul
,
I
will
make
you
the
rich
poor
woman
in
the
nation
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
pull
out
a
handful
of
guinea
,
a
sight
which
would
have
bribe
person
of
much
great
consequence
than
this
poor
wench
to
much
bad
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
Susan
,
from
the
account
she
have
receive
of
Mrs
Waters
,
make
not
the
least
doubt
but
that
she
be
the
very
identical
stray
whom
the
right
owner
pursue
.
<EOS>
as
she
conclude
,
therefore
,
with
great
appearance
of
reason
,
that
she
never
could
get
money
in
an
honester
way
than
by
restore
a
wife
to
her
husband
,
she
make
no
scruple
of
assure
the
gentleman
that
the
lady
he
want
be
then
in
the
house
;
and
be
presently
afterwards
prevail
upon
(
by
very
liberal
promise
,
and
some
earnest
pay
into
her
hand
)
to
conduct
him
to
the
bedchamber
of
Mrs
Waters
.
  
<EOS>
It
hath
be
a
custom
long
establish
in
the
polite
world
,
and
that
upon
very
solid
and
substantial
reason
,
that
a
husband
shall
never
enter
his
wife
's
apartment
without
first
knock
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
the
many
excellent
use
of
this
custom
need
scarce
be
hint
to
a
reader
who
hath
any
knowledge
of
the
world
;
for
by
this
mean
the
lady
hath
time
to
adjust
herself
,
or
to
remove
any
disagreeable
object
out
of
the
way
;
for
there
be
some
situation
in
which
nice
and
delicate
woman
would
not
be
discover
by
their
husband
.
  
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
there
be
several
ceremony
institute
among
the
polished
part
of
mankind
,
which
,
though
they
may
,
to
coarser
judgment
,
appear
as
matter
of
mere
form
,
be
find
to
have
much
of
substance
in
them
,
by
the
more
discerning
;
and
lucky
would
it
have
be
have
the
custom
above
mention
be
observe
by
our
gentleman
in
the
present
instance
.
<EOS>
Knock
,
indeed
,
he
do
at
the
door
,
but
not
with
one
of
those
gentle
rap
which
be
usual
on
such
occasion
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
when
he
find
the
door
lock
,
he
fly
at
it
with
such
violence
,
that
the
lock
immediately
give
way
,
the
door
burst
open
,
and
he
fall
headlong
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
no
sooner
recover
his
leg
than
forth
from
the
bed
,
upon
his
leg
likewise
,
appear
 
with
shame
and
sorrow
<EOS>
be
we
oblige
to
proceed
 
our
heroe
himself
,
who
,
with
a
menacing
voice
,
demand
of
the
gentleman
who
he
be
,
and
what
he
mean
by
dare
to
burst
open
his
chamber
in
that
outrageous
manner
.
  
<EOS>
the
gentleman
at
first
thought
he
have
commit
a
mistake
,
and
be
go
to
ask
pardon
and
retreat
,
when
,
on
a
sudden
,
as
the
moon
shine
very
bright
,
he
cast
his
eye
on
stay
,
gown
,
petticoat
,
cap
,
ribbon
,
stocking
,
garter
,
shoe
,
clogs
,
&
c.
,
all
which
lie
in
a
disorder
manner
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
all
these
,
operate
on
the
natural
jealousy
of
his
temper
,
so
enrage
him
,
that
he
lose
all
power
of
speech
;
and
,
without
return
any
answer
to
Jones
,
he
endeavour
to
approach
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
immediately
interpose
,
a
fierce
contention
arise
,
which
soon
proceed
to
blow
on
both
side
.
<EOS>
and
now
Mrs
Waters
(
for
we
must
confess
she
be
in
the
same
bed
)
,
<EOS>
be
,
I
suppose
,
awaken
from
her
sleep
,
and
see
two
man
fight
in
her
bedchamber
,
begin
to
scream
in
the
most
violent
manner
,
cry
out
murder
!
<EOS>
robbery
!
<EOS>
and
more
frequently
rape
!
<EOS>
which
last
,
some
,
perhaps
,
may
wonder
she
should
mention
,
who
do
not
consider
that
these
word
of
exclamation
be
use
by
lady
in
a
fright
,
as
fa
,
la
,
la
,
ra
,
da
,
&
c.
,
be
in
music
,
only
as
the
vehicle
of
sound
,
and
without
any
fix
idea
.
  
<EOS>
next
to
the
lady
's
chamber
be
deposit
the
body
of
an
irish
gentleman
who
arrive
too
late
at
the
inn
to
have
be
mention
before
.
<EOS>
this
gentleman
be
one
of
those
whom
the
irish
call
a
calabalaro
,
or
cavalier
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
young
brother
of
a
good
family
,
and
,
have
no
fortune
at
home
,
be
oblige
to
look
abroad
in
order
to
get
one
;
for
which
purpose
he
be
proceed
to
the
Bath
,
to
try
his
luck
with
card
and
the
woman
.
  
<EOS>
this
young
fellow
lie
in
bed
read
one
of
Mrs
Behn
's
novel
;
for
he
have
be
instruct
by
a
friend
that
he
would
find
no
more
effectual
method
of
recommend
himself
to
the
lady
than
the
improve
his
understanding
,
and
fill
his
mind
with
good
literature
.
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
,
therefore
,
hear
the
violent
uproar
in
the
next
room
,
than
he
leap
from
his
bolster
,
and
,
take
his
sword
in
one
hand
,
and
the
candle
which
burn
by
him
in
the
other
,
he
go
directly
to
Mrs
Waters
's
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
sight
of
another
man
in
his
shirt
at
first
add
some
shock
to
the
decency
of
the
lady
,
it
make
her
presently
amend
by
considerably
abate
her
fear
;
for
no
sooner
have
the
calabalaro
enter
the
room
than
he
cry
out
,
"
Mr
Fitzpatrick
,
what
the
devil
be
the
maning
of
this
?
"
<EOS>
upon
which
the
other
immediately
answer
,
"
o
,
Mr
Maclachlan
!
<EOS>
I
be
rejoice
you
be
here
.
 
<EOS>
this
villain
hath
debauch
my
wife
,
and
be
get
into
bed
with
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
wife
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Maclachlan
;
"
do
not
I
know
<EOS>
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
very
well
,
and
<EOS>
do
not
I
see
that
the
lady
,
whom
the
gentleman
who
stand
here
in
his
shirt
be
lie
in
bed
with
,
be
none
of
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
Fitzpatrick
,
now
perceive
,
as
well
by
the
glimpse
he
have
of
the
lady
,
as
by
her
voice
,
which
may
have
be
distinguish
at
a
great
distance
than
he
now
stand
from
her
,
that
he
have
make
a
very
unfortunate
mistake
,
begin
to
ask
many
pardon
of
the
lady
;
and
then
,
turn
to
Jones
,
he
say
,
"
I
would
have
you
take
notice
<EOS>
I
do
not
ask
your
pardon
,
for
you
have
bate
me
;
for
which
I
be
resolve
to
have
your
blood
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
Jones
treat
this
menace
with
much
contempt
;
and
Mr
Maclachlan
answer
,
"
indeed
,
Mr
Fitzpatrick
,
you
may
be
ashamed
of
your
own
self
,
to
disturb
people
at
this
time
of
night
;
if
all
the
people
in
the
inn
be
not
asleep
,
you
would
have
awaken
them
as
you
have
me
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
have
serve
you
very
rightly
.
<EOS>
upon
my
conscience
,
though
I
have
no
wife
,
if
you
have
treat
her
so
,
I
would
have
cut
your
throat
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
be
so
confound
with
his
fear
for
his
lady
's
reputation
,
that
he
know
neither
what
to
say
or
do
;
but
the
invention
of
woman
be
,
as
hath
be
observe
,
much
ready
than
that
of
man
.
<EOS>
She
recollect
that
there
be
a
communication
between
her
chamber
and
that
of
Mr
Jones
;
rely
,
therefore
,
on
his
honour
and
her
own
assurance
,
she
answer
,
"
I
know
not
what
you
mean
,
villain
!
<EOS>
I
be
wife
to
none
of
you
.
<EOS>
help
!
<EOS>
rape
!
<EOS>
murder
!
<EOS>
rape
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
now
,
the
landlady
come
into
the
room
,
Mrs
Waters
fall
upon
her
with
the
utmost
virulence
,
say
,
"
She
think
herself
in
a
sober
inn
,
and
not
in
a
bawdy
-
house
;
but
that
a
set
of
villain
have
break
into
her
room
,
with
an
intent
upon
her
honour
,
if
not
upon
her
life
;
and
both
,
she
say
,
be
equally
dear
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
landlady
now
begin
to
roar
as
loudly
as
the
poor
woman
in
bed
have
do
before
.
<EOS>
She
cry
,
"
She
be
undone
,
and
that
the
reputation
of
her
house
,
which
be
never
blow
upon
before
,
be
utterly
destroy
.
"
<EOS>
then
,
turn
to
the
man
,
she
cry
,
"
what
,
in
the
devil
's
name
,
be
the
reason
of
all
this
disturbance
in
the
lady
's
room
?
"
<EOS>
Fitzpatrick
,
hang
down
his
head
,
repeat
,
"
that
he
have
commit
a
mistake
,
for
which
he
heartily
ask
pardon
,
"
and
then
retire
with
his
countryman
.
<EOS>
Jones
,
who
be
too
ingenious
to
have
miss
the
hint
give
him
by
his
fair
one
,
boldly
assert
,
"
that
he
have
run
to
her
assistance
upon
hear
the
door
break
open
,
with
what
design
he
could
not
conceive
,
unless
of
rob
the
lady
;
which
,
if
they
intend
,
he
say
,
he
have
the
good
fortune
to
prevent
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
never
have
a
robbery
commit
in
my
house
since
I
have
keep
it
,
"
cry
the
landlady
;
"
I
would
have
you
to
know
,
<EOS>
sir
,
I
harbour
no
highwayman
here
;
I
scorn
the
word
,
thof
<EOS>
I
say
it
.
<EOS>
none
but
honest
,
good
gentlefolk
,
be
welcome
to
my
house
;
and
,
I
thank
good
luck
<EOS>
,
I
have
always
have
enow
of
such
customer
;
indeed
as
many
as
I
could
entertain
.
<EOS>
here
hath
be
my
lord
,
"
and
then
she
repeat
over
a
catalogue
of
name
and
title
,
many
of
which
we
may
,
perhaps
,
be
guilty
of
a
breach
of
privilege
by
insert
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
,
after
much
patience
,
at
length
interrupt
her
,
by
make
an
apology
to
Mrs
Waters
,
for
have
appear
before
her
in
his
shirt
,
assure
her
"
that
nothing
but
a
concern
for
her
safety
could
have
prevail
on
him
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
the
reader
may
inform
himself
of
her
answer
,
and
,
indeed
,
of
her
whole
behaviour
to
the
end
of
the
scene
,
by
consider
the
situation
which
she
affect
,
it
be
that
of
a
modest
lady
,
who
be
awaken
out
of
her
sleep
by
three
strange
man
in
her
chamber
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
part
which
she
undertake
to
perform
;
and
,
indeed
,
she
execute
it
so
well
,
that
none
of
our
theatrical
actress
could
exceed
her
,
in
any
of
their
performance
,
either
on
or
off
the
stage
.
  
<EOS>
and
hence
,
I
think
,
we
may
very
fairly
draw
an
argument
,
to
prove
how
extremely
natural
virtue
be
to
the
fair
sex
;
for
,
though
there
be
not
,
perhaps
,
one
in
ten
thousand
who
be
capable
of
make
a
good
actress
,
and
even
among
these
we
rarely
see
two
who
be
equally
able
to
personate
the
same
character
,
yet
this
of
virtue
they
can
all
admirably
well
put
on
;
and
as
well
those
individual
who
have
it
not
,
as
those
who
possess
it
<EOS>
,
can
all
act
it
to
the
utmost
degree
of
perfection
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
man
be
all
depart
,
Mrs
Waters
,
recover
from
her
fear
,
recover
likewise
from
her
anger
,
and
speak
in
much
gentle
accent
to
the
landlady
,
who
do
not
so
readily
quit
her
concern
for
the
reputation
of
the
house
,
in
favour
of
which
she
begin
again
to
number
the
many
great
person
who
have
sleep
under
her
roof
;
but
the
lady
stopt
her
short
,
and
have
absolutely
acquit
her
of
have
have
any
share
in
the
past
disturbance
,
beg
to
be
leave
to
her
repose
,
which
,
she
say
,
she
hope
to
enjoy
unmoleste
during
the
remainder
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
upon
which
the
landlady
,
after
much
civility
and
many
courtsie
,
take
her
leave
.
    
<EOS>
a
dialogue
between
the
landlady
and
Susan
the
chamber
-
maid
,
proper
to
be
read
by
all
inn
-
keepers
and
their
servant
;
with
the
arrival
,
and
affable
behaviour
of
a
beautiful
young
lady
;
which
may
teach
person
of
condition
how
they
may
acquire
the
love
of
the
whole
world
.
 
<EOS>
the
landlady
,
remember
that
Susan
have
be
the
only
person
out
of
bed
when
the
door
be
burst
open
,
resort
presently
to
her
,
to
enquire
into
the
first
occasion
of
the
disturbance
,
as
well
as
who
the
strange
gentleman
be
,
and
when
and
how
he
arrive
.
  
<EOS>
Susan
relate
the
whole
story
which
the
reader
know
already
,
vary
the
truth
only
in
some
circumstance
,
as
she
see
convenient
,
and
totally
conceal
the
money
which
she
have
receive
.
<EOS>
but
whereas
her
mistress
have
,
in
the
preface
to
her
enquiry
,
speak
much
in
compassion
for
the
fright
which
the
lady
have
be
in
concern
any
intended
depredation
on
her
virtue
,
Susan
could
not
help
endeavour
to
quiet
the
concern
which
her
mistress
seem
to
be
under
on
that
account
,
by
swear
heartily
she
see
Jones
leap
out
from
her
bed
.
  
<EOS>
the
landlady
fall
into
a
violent
rage
at
these
word
.
<EOS>
"
a
likely
story
,
truly
,
"
cry
she
,
"
that
a
woman
should
cry
out
,
and
endeavour
to
expose
herself
,
if
that
be
the
case
!
<EOS>
I
desire
to
know
what
well
proof
any
lady
can
give
of
her
virtue
than
her
cry
out
,
which
,
I
believe
,
twenty
people
can
witness
for
her
she
do
?
<EOS>
I
beg
,
madam
,
you
would
spread
no
such
scandal
of
any
of
my
guest
;
for
it
will
not
only
reflect
on
them
,
but
upon
the
house
;
and
I
be
sure
no
vagabond
,
nor
wicked
beggarly
people
,
come
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Susan
,
"
then
I
must
not
believe
my
own
eye
.
"
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
must
you
not
always
,
"
answer
her
mistress
;
"
I
would
not
have
believe
my
own
eye
against
such
good
gentlefolk
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
have
a
well
supper
order
this
half
-
year
than
they
order
last
night
;
and
so
easy
and
good
-
humoured
be
they
,
that
they
find
no
fault
with
my
Worcestershire
perry
,
which
I
sell
them
for
champagne
;
and
to
be
sure
it
be
as
well
taste
and
as
wholesome
as
the
good
champagne
in
the
kingdom
,
otherwise
I
would
scorn
to
give
it
'em
;
and
they
drink
me
two
bottle
.
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
I
will
never
believe
any
harm
of
such
sober
good
sort
of
people
.
"
  
<EOS>
Susan
be
thus
silence
,
her
mistress
proceed
to
other
matter
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
you
tell
me
,
"
continue
she
,
"
that
the
strange
gentleman
come
post
,
and
there
be
a
footman
without
with
the
horse
;
why
,
then
,
he
be
certainly
some
of
your
great
gentlefolk
too
.
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
ask
him
whether
he
would
have
any
supper
?
<EOS>
I
think
he
be
in
the
other
gentleman
's
room
;
go
up
and
ask
whether
he
call
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
will
order
something
when
he
find
anybody
stir
in
the
house
to
dress
it
.
<EOS>
now
do
not
commit
any
of
your
usual
blunder
,
by
tell
him
the
fire
be
out
,
and
the
fowl
alive
.
<EOS>
and
if
he
should
order
mutton
,
do
not
blab
out
that
we
have
none
.
<EOS>
the
butcher
,
I
know
,
kill
a
sheep
just
before
I
go
to
bed
,
and
he
never
refuse
to
cut
it
up
warm
when
I
desire
it
.
<EOS>
go
,
remember
there
be
all
sort
of
mutton
and
fowl
;
go
,
open
the
door
with
,
Gentlemen
,
d'ye
call
?
<EOS>
and
if
they
say
nothing
,
ask
what
his
honour
will
be
pleased
to
have
for
supper
?
<EOS>
do
not
forget
his
honour
.
<EOS>
go
;
if
you
do
not
mind
all
these
matter
better
,
you
will
never
come
to
anything
.
"
  
<EOS>
Susan
depart
,
and
soon
return
with
an
account
that
the
two
gentleman
be
get
both
into
the
same
bed
.
"
<EOS>
two
gentleman
,
"
say
the
landlady
,
"
in
the
same
bed
!
<EOS>
that
be
impossible
;
they
be
two
arrant
scrub
,
I
warrant
them
;
and
I
believe
young
Squire
Allworthy
guess
right
,
that
the
fellow
intend
to
rob
her
ladyship
;
for
,
if
he
have
break
open
the
lady
's
door
with
any
of
the
wicked
design
of
a
gentleman
,
he
would
never
have
sneak
away
to
another
room
to
save
the
expense
of
a
supper
and
a
bed
to
himself
.
<EOS>
They
be
certainly
thief
,
and
their
searching
after
a
wife
be
nothing
but
a
pretence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
these
censure
my
landlady
do
Mr
Fitzpatrick
great
injustice
;
for
he
be
really
bear
a
gentleman
,
though
not
worth
a
groat
;
and
though
,
perhaps
,
he
have
some
few
blemish
in
his
heart
as
well
as
in
his
head
,
yet
be
a
sneaking
or
a
niggardly
fellow
be
not
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
in
reality
,
he
be
so
generous
<EOS>
a
man
,
that
,
whereas
he
have
receive
a
very
handsome
fortune
with
his
wife
,
he
have
now
spend
every
penny
of
it
,
except
some
little
pittance
which
be
settle
upon
her
;
and
,
in
order
to
possess
himself
of
this
,
he
have
use
her
with
such
cruelty
,
that
,
together
with
his
jealousy
,
which
be
of
the
bitter
kind
,
it
have
force
the
poor
woman
to
run
away
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
this
gentleman
then
be
well
tired
with
his
long
journey
from
Chester
in
one
day
,
with
which
,
and
some
good
dry
blow
he
have
receive
in
the
scuffle
,
his
bone
be
so
sore
,
that
,
add
to
the
soreness
of
his
mind
,
it
have
quite
deprive
him
of
any
appetite
for
eat
.
<EOS>
and
be
now
so
violently
disappointed
in
the
woman
whom
,
at
the
maid
's
instance
,
he
have
mistake
for
his
wife
,
it
never
once
enter
into
his
head
that
she
may
nevertheless
be
in
the
house
,
though
he
have
err
in
the
first
person
he
have
attack
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
yield
to
the
dissuasion
of
his
friend
from
search
any
farther
after
her
that
night
,
and
accept
the
kind
offer
of
part
of
his
bed
.
  
<EOS>
the
footman
and
post
-
boy
be
in
a
different
disposition
.
<EOS>
They
be
more
ready
to
order
than
the
landlady
be
to
provide
;
however
,
after
be
pretty
well
satisfied
by
them
of
the
real
truth
of
the
case
,
and
that
Mr
Fitzpatrick
be
no
thief
,
she
be
at
length
prevail
on
to
set
some
cold
meat
before
them
,
which
they
be
devour
with
great
greediness
,
when
Partridge
come
into
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
first
awake
by
the
hurry
which
we
have
before
see
;
and
while
he
be
endeavour
to
compose
himself
again
on
his
pillow
,
<EOS>
a
screech
-
owl
have
give
him
such
a
serenade
at
his
window
,
that
he
leap
in
a
most
horrible
affright
from
his
bed
,
and
,
huddle
on
his
cloath
with
great
expedition
,
run
down
to
the
protection
of
the
company
,
whom
he
hear
talk
below
in
the
kitchen
.
  
<EOS>
His
arrival
detain
my
landlady
from
return
to
her
rest
;
for
she
be
just
about
to
leave
the
other
two
guest
to
the
care
of
Susan
;
but
the
friend
of
young
Squire
Allworthy
be
not
to
be
so
neglect
,
especially
as
he
call
for
a
pint
of
wine
to
be
mull
.
<EOS>
She
immediately
obey
,
by
put
the
same
quantity
of
perry
to
the
fire
;
for
this
readily
answer
to
the
name
of
every
kind
of
wine
.
  
<EOS>
the
irish
footman
be
retire
to
bed
,
and
the
post
-
boy
be
go
to
follow
;
but
Partridge
invite
him
to
stay
and
partake
of
his
wine
,
which
the
lad
very
thankfully
accept
.
<EOS>
the
schoolmaster
be
indeed
afraid
to
return
to
bed
by
himself
;
and
as
he
do
not
know
how
soon
he
may
lose
the
company
of
my
landlady
,
he
be
resolve
to
secure
that
of
the
boy
,
in
whose
presence
he
apprehend
no
danger
from
the
devil
or
any
of
his
adherent
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
arrive
another
post
-
boy
at
the
gate
;
upon
which
Susan
,
be
order
out
,
return
,
introduce
two
young
woman
in
ride
habit
,
one
of
which
be
so
very
richly
lace
,
that
Partridge
and
the
post
-
boy
instantly
start
from
their
chair
,
and
my
landlady
fall
to
her
courtsie
,
and
her
ladyship
,
with
great
eagerness
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
in
the
rich
habit
say
,
with
a
smile
of
great
condescension
,
"
if
you
will
give
me
leave
,
madam
,
I
will
warm
myself
a
few
minute
at
your
kitchen
fire
,
for
it
be
really
very
cold
;
but
I
must
insist
on
disturb
no
one
from
his
seat
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
speak
on
account
of
Partridge
,
who
have
retreat
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
strike
with
the
utmost
awe
and
astonishment
at
the
splendor
of
the
lady
's
dress
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
have
a
much
well
title
to
respect
than
this
;
for
she
be
one
of
the
most
beautiful
creature
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
earnestly
desire
Partridge
to
return
to
his
seat
;
but
could
not
prevail
.
<EOS>
She
then
pull
off
her
glove
,
and
display
to
the
fire
two
hand
,
which
have
every
property
of
snow
in
them

except
that
of
melt
.
<EOS>
Her
companion
,
who
be
indeed
her
maid
,
likewise
pull
off
her
glove
,
and
discover
what
bore
an
exact
resemblance
,
in
cold
and
colour
,
to
a
piece
of
frozen
beef
.
  
<EOS>
"
I

indeed

it
be
scarce
possible

him
jackanapes
,
and
return
in
a
violent
hurry
to
her
mistress
,
whom
she
acquaint
with
the
success
of
her
errand
,
and
with
the
account
she
have
receive
;
which
,
if
possible
,
she
exaggerate
,
be
as
angry
with
Jones
as
if
he
have
pronounce
all
the
word
that
come
from
the
mouth
of
Partridge
.
<EOS>
She
discharge
a
torrent
of
abuse
on
the
master
,
and
advise
her
mistress
to
quit
all
thought
of
a
man
who
have
never
show
himself
deserve
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
then
rip
up
the
story
of
Molly
Seagrim
,
and
give
the
most
malicious
turn
to
his
formerly
quit
Sophia
herself
;
which
,
I
must
confess
,
the
present
incident
not
a
little
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
the
spirit
of
Sophia
be
too
much
dissipate
by
concern
to
enable
her
to
stop
the
torrent
of
her
maid
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
however
,
she
interrupt
her
,
say
,
"
I
never
can
believe
this
;
some
villain
hath
belie
him
.
<EOS>
You
say
you
have
it
from
his
friend
;
but
surely
it
be
not
the
office
of
a
friend
to
betray
such
secret
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
"
cry
Honour
,
"
the
fellow
be
his
pimp
;
for
I
never
see
so
ill
-
look
a
villain
.
<EOS>
besides
,
such
profligate
rake
as
Mr
Jones
be
never
ashamed
of
these
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
this
behaviour
of
Partridge
be
a
little
inexcusable
;
but
he
have
not
sleep
off
the
effect
of
the
dose
which
he
swallow
the
evening
before
;
which
have
,
in
the
morning
,
receive
the
addition
of
above
a
pint
of
wine
,
or
indeed
rather
of
malt
spirit
;
for
the
perry
be
by
no
means
pure
.
<EOS>
now
,
that
part
of
his
head
which
Nature
design
for
the
reservoir
of
drink
be
very
shallow
,
a
small
quantity
of
liquor
overflow
it
,
and
open
the
sluice
of
his
heart
;
so
that
all
the
secret
there
deposit
run
out
.
<EOS>
these
sluice
be
indeed
,
naturally
,
very
ill
-
secured
.
<EOS>
to
give
the
best
-
natured
turn
we
can
to
his
disposition
,
he
be
a
very
honest
man
;
for
,
as
he
be
the
most
inquisitive
of
mortal
,
and
eternally
pry
into
the
secret
of
other
,
so
he
very
faithfully
pay
them
by
communicate
,
in
return
,
everything
within
his
knowledge
.
  
<EOS>
while
Sophia
,
torment
with
anxiety

know
not
what
to
believe

nor
what
resolution
to
take
,
Susan
arrive
with

<EOS>
Mrs

immediately
advise
her
mistress
,
in
a
whisper
,
to
pump
this
wench
,
who
probably
could
inform
her
of
the
truth

<EOS>
Sophia
approve
it
,
and
begin
as
follow
:

take
the

tell

conclude
with
say

She

negative

tremble

pale

Mrs

beg
her
to

Sophia
give
her
a
third
guinea

,
tell
her
she
would
certainly
be
her
friend
if
she
mention
nothing

what

nor
inform
any

dismiss
the

with
order

<EOS>
be

her

she
tell
her
trusty
wait

woman

"
that
she
never
be
more
easy
than
at
present

<EOS>
I
be
now
convince
,
"
say
she
,
"
he
be
not
only
a
villain

but
a
low
despicable
wretch

<EOS>
I
can
forgive
all
rather
than
his
expose
my

in
so
barbarous
a
manner

that
render
him
the

<EOS>
yes

I
be

easy

I

I
be
very
easy

and
then
she
burst
into
a
violent
flood
of
tear
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
short
interval
spend
by
Sophia
,
chiefly
in
crying
,
and
assure
her
maid
that
she
be
perfectly
easy

Susan
arrive
with
an
account
that
the
horse

ready

when
a
very
extraordinary
thought
suggest
itself
to
our
young
heroine

by
which
Mr
Jones
would
be
acquaint
with
her
have
be
at
the
inn
,
in
a
way
which
,
if
any
spark
of
affection
for
her
remain
in
him
,
would
be
at
least
some
punishment
for
his
fault

<EOS>
the
reader
will
be
pleased
to
remember
a
little
muff
,
which
hath
have
the
honour
of
be
more
than
once
remember
already
in
this
history

<EOS>
this
muff
,
ever
since
the
departure
of
Mr
Jones
,
have
be
the
constant
companion
of
Sophia
by
day

and
her
bedfellow
by
night

and
this
muff
she
have
at
this
very
instant
upon
her
arm

whence
she
take
it
off
with
great
indignation

and
,
have
writ
<EOS>
her
name
with
her
pencil
upon
a
piece
of
paper
which
she
pin
to
it
<EOS>
,
she

the
maid
to
convey
it
into
the
empty
bed
of
Mr

,
in
which
,
if
he
do
not
find
it
,
she
charge
her
to
take
some
method
of
convey
it
before
his
eye
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
have
pay
for
what
Mrs
Honour
have
eat
,
in
which
bill
be
include
an
account
for
what
she
herself
may
have
eat
,
she
mount
her
horse

and
,
once
more
assure
her
companion
that
she
be
perfectly
easy
,
continue
her
journey
.
    
<EOS>
Containing
,
among
other
thing
,
the
ingenuity
of
Partridge
,
the
madness
of
Jones
,
and
the
folly
of
Fitzpatrick
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
past
five
in
the
morning
,
and
other
company
begin
to
rise
and
come
to
the
kitchen
,
among
whom
be
the
serjeant
and
the
coachman
,
who
,
be
thoroughly
reconcile
,
make
a
libation
,
or
,
in
the
english
phrase
,
drink
a
hearty
cup
together
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
drinking
nothing
more
remarkable
happen
than
the
behaviour
of
Partridge
,
who
,
when
the
serjeant
drink
a
health
to
King
George
,
repeat
only
the
word
King
;
nor
could
he
be
bring
to
utter
more
;
for
though
he
be
go
to
fight
against
his
own
cause
,
yet
he
could
not
be
prevail
upon
to
drink
against
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Jones
,
be
now
return
to
his
own
bed
(
but
from
whence
he
return
we
must
beg
to
be
excuse
from
relate
)
,
summon
Partridge
from
this
agreeable
company
,
who
,
after
a
ceremonious
preface
,
have
obtain
leave
to
offer
his
advice
,
deliver
himself
as
follow
:
    
<EOS>
"
It
be
,
sir
,
an
old
saying
,
and
a
true
one
,
that
a
wise
man
may
sometimes
learn
counsel
from
a
fool
;
I
wish
,
therefore
,
I
may
be
so
bold
as
to
offer
you
my
advice
,
which
be
to
return
home
again
,
and
leave
these
horrida
bella
,
these
bloody
war
,
to
fellow
who
be
content
to
swallow
gunpowder
,
because
they
have
nothing
else
to
eat
.
<EOS>
now
,
everybody
know
your
honour
want
for
nothing
at
home
;
when
that
be
the
case
,
why
should
any
man
travel
abroad
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
partridge
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
thou
art
certainly
a
coward
;
I
wish
,
therefore
,
thou
wouldst
return
home
thyself
,
and
trouble
me
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
your
honour
's
pardon
,
"
cry
Partridge
;
"
I
speak
on
your
account
more
than
my
own
;
for
as
to
me
,
Heaven
know
my
circumstance
be
bad
enough
,
and
I
be
so
far
from
be
afraid
,
that
I
value
a
pistol
,
or
a
blunderbuss
,
or
any
such
thing
,
no
more
than
a
pop
-
gun
.
<EOS>
every
man
must
die
once
,
and
what
signify
the
manner
<EOS>
how
?
<EOS>
besides
,
perhaps
I
may
come
off
with
the
loss
only
of
an
arm
or
a
leg
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
sir
,
I
be
never
less
afraid
in
my
life
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
if
your
honour
be
resolve
to
go
on
,
I
be
resolve
to
follow
you
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
that
case
,
I
wish
I
may
give
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
it
be
a
scandalous
way
of
travelling
,
for
a
great
gentleman
like
you
to
walk
afoot
.
<EOS>
now
here
be
two
or
three
good
horse
in
the
stable
,
which
the
landlord
will
certainly
make
no
scruple
of
trust
you
with
;
but
,
if
he
should
,
I
can
easily
contrive
to
take
them
;
and
,
let
the
bad
come
to
the
bad
,
the
king
would
certainly
pardon
you
,
as
you
be
go
to
fight
in
his
cause
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
now
,
as
the
honesty
of
Partridge
be
equal
to
his
understanding
,
and
both
deal
only
in
small
matter
,
he
would
never
have
attempt
a
roguery
of
this
kind
,
have
he
not
imagine
it
altogether
safe
;
for
he
be
one
of
those
who
have
more
consideration
of
the
gallow
than
of
the
fitness
of
thing
;
but
,
in
reality
,
he
think
he
may
have
commit
this
felony
without
any
danger
;
for
,
besides
that
he
doubt
not
but
the
name
of
Mr
Allworthy
would
sufficiently
quiet
the
landlord
,
he
conceive
they
should
be
altogether
safe
,
<EOS>
whatever
turn
affair
may
take
;
as
Jones
,
he
imagine
,
would
have
friend
enough
on
one
side
,
and
as
his
friend
would
as
well
secure
him
on
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mr
Jones
find
that
Partridge
be
in
earnest
in
this
proposal
,
he
very
severely
rebuke
him
,
and
that
in
such
bitter
term
,
that
the
other
attempt
to
laugh
it
off
,
and
presently
turn
the
discourse
to
other
matter
;
say
,
he
believe
they
be
then
in
a
bawdy
house
,
and
that
he
have
with
much
ado
prevent
two
wench
from
disturb
his
honour
in
the
middle
of
the
night
.
"
<EOS>
Heyday
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
"
I
believe
they
get
into
your
chamber
whether
I
would
or
no
;
for
here
lie
the
muff
of
one
of
them
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
as
Jones
return
to
his
bed
in
the
dark
,
he
have
never
perceive
the
muff
on
the
quilt
,
and
,
in
leap
into
his
bed
,
he
have
tumble
it
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
this
Partridge
now
take
up
,
and
be
go
to
put
into
his
pocket
,
when
Jones
desire
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
the
muff
be
so
very
remarkable
,
that
our
heroe
may
possibly
have
recollect
it
without
the
information
annex
.
<EOS>
but
his
memory
be
not
put
to
that
hard
office
;
for
at
the
same
instant
he
see
and
read
the
word
Sophia
Western
upon
the
paper
which
be
pin
to
it
.
<EOS>
His
look
now
grow
frantic
in
a
moment
,
and
he
eagerly
cry
out
,
"
oh
Heavens
!
<EOS>
how
come
this
muff
here
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
know
no
more
than
your
honour
,
"
cry
Partridge
;
"
but
I
see
it
upon
the
arm
of
one
of
the
woman
who
would
have
disturb
you
,
if
I
would
have
suffer
them
.
"
<EOS>
"
where
be
they
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Jones
,
jump
out
of
bed
,
and
lay
hold
of
his
cloath
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
many
mile
off
,
I
believe
,
by
this
time
,
"
say
Partridge
.
<EOS>
and
now
Jones
,
upon
further
enquiry
,
be
sufficiently
assure
that
the
bearer
of
this
muff
be
no
other
than
the
lovely
Sophia
herself
.
  
<EOS>
the
behaviour
of
Jones
on
this
occasion
,
his
thought
,
his
look
,
his
word
,
his
action
,
be
such
as
beggar
all
description
.
<EOS>
after
many
bitter
execration
on
Partridge
,
and
not
few
on
himself
,
he
order
the
poor
fellow
,
who
be
frighten
out
of
his
wit
,
to
run
down
and
hire
him
horse
at
any
rate
;
and
a
very
few
minute
afterwards
,
have
shuffle
on
his
clothe
,
he
hasten
down
-
stair
to
execute
the
order
himself
,
which
he
have
just
before
give
.
  
<EOS>
but
before
we
proceed
to
what
pass
on
his
arrival
in
the
kitchen
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
recur
to
what
have
there
happen
since
Partridge
have
first
leave
it
on
his
master
's
summon
.
  
<EOS>
the
serjeant
be
just
march
off
with
his
party
,
when
the
two
irish
gentleman
arise
,
and
come
downstairs
;
both
complain
that
they
have
be
so
often
wake
by
the
noise
in
the
inn
,
that
they
have
never
once
be
able
to
close
their
eye
all
night
.
  
<EOS>
the
coach
which
have
bring
the
young
lady
and
her
maid
,
and
which
,
perhaps
,
the
reader
may
have
hitherto
conclude
be
her
own
,
be
,
indeed
,
a
return
coach
belong
to
Mr
King
,
of
Bath
,
one
of
the
worthy
and
honest
man
that
ever
deal
in
horse
-
flesh
,
and
whose
coach
we
heartily
recommend
to
all
our
reader
who
travel
that
road
.
<EOS>
by
which
mean
they
may
,
perhaps
,
have
the
pleasure
of
ride
in
the
very
coach
,
and
be
drive
by
the
very
coachman
,
that
be
record
in
this
history
.
  
<EOS>
the
coachman
,
have
but
two
passenger
,
and
hear
Mr
Maclachlan
be
go
to
Bath
,
offer
to
carry
him
thither
at
a
very
moderate
price
.
<EOS>
He
be
induce
to
this
by
the
report
of
the
hostler
,
who
say
that
the
horse
which
Mr
Maclachlan
have
hire
from
Worcester
would
be
much
more
pleased
with
return
to
his
friend
there
than
to
prosecute
a
long
journey
;
for
that
the
say
horse
be
rather
a
two
-
legged
than
a
four
-
legged
animal
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Maclachlan
immediately
close
with
the
proposal
of
the
coachman
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
persuade
his
friend
Fitzpatrick
to
accept
of
the
fourth
place
in
the
coach
.
<EOS>
this
conveyance
the
soreness
of
his
bone
make
more
agreeable
to
him
than
a
horse
;
and
,
be
well
assure
of
meet
with
his
wife
at
Bath
<EOS>
,
he
think
a
little
delay
would
be
of
no
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
Maclachlan
,
who
be
much
the
sharp
man
of
the
two
,
no
sooner
hear
that
this
lady
come
from
Chester
,
with
the
other
circumstance
which
he
learn
from
the
hostler
,
than
it
come
into
his
head
that
she
may
possibly
be
his
friend
's
wife
;
and
presently
acquaint
him
with
this
suspicion
,
which
have
never
once
occur
to
Fitzpatrick
himself
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
he
be
one
of
those
composition
which
nature
make
up
in
too
great
a
hurry
,
and
forget
to
put
any
brain
into
their
head
.
  
<EOS>
now
it
happen
to
this
sort
of
man
,
as
to
bad
hound
,
who
never
hit
off
a
fault
themselves
;
but
no
sooner
doth
a
dog
of
sagacity
open
his
mouth
than
they
immediately
do
the
same
,
and
,
without
the
guidance
of
any
scent
,
run
directly
forwards
as
fast
as
they
be
able
.
<EOS>
in
the
same
manner
,
the
very
moment
Mr
Maclachlan
have
mention
his
apprehension
,
Mr
Fitzpatrick
instantly
concur
,
and
fly
directly
up
-
stair
,
to
surprize
his
wife
,
before
he
know
where
she
be
;
and
unluckily
(
as
Fortune
love
to
play
trick
with
those
gentleman
who
put
themselves
entirely
under
her
conduct
)
run
his
head
against
several
door
and
post
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
much
kinder
be
she
to
me
,
when
she
suggest
that
simile
of
the
hound
,
just
before
insert
;
since
the
poor
wife
may
,
on
these
occasion
,
be
so
justly
compare
to
a
hunted
hare
.
<EOS>
like
that
little
wretched
animal
,
she
prick
up
her
ear
to
listen
after
the
voice
of
her
pursuer
;
like
her
,
fly
away
tremble
when
she
hear
it
;
and
,
like
her
,
be
generally
overtaken
and
destroy
in
the
end
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
not
however
the
case
at
present
;
for
after
a
long
fruitless
search
,
Mr
Fitzpatrick
return
to
the
kitchen
,
where
,
as
if
this
have
be
a
real
chace
,
enter
a
gentleman
hallowing
as
hunter
do
when
the
hound
be
at
a
fault
.
<EOS>
He
be
just
alight
from
his
horse
,
and
have
many
attendant
at
his
heel
.
  
<EOS>
here
,
reader
,
it
may
be
necessary
to
acquaint
thee
with
some
matter
,
which
,
if
thou
dost
know
already
,
thou
art
wise
than
I
take
thee
to
be
.
<EOS>
and
this
information
thou
shalt
receive
in
the
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
be
conclude
the
adventure
that
happen
at
the
inn
at
Upton
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
then
,
this
gentleman
just
arrive
be
no
other
person
than
Squire
Western
himself
,
who
be
come
hither
in
pursuit
of
his
daughter
;
and
,
have
he
fortunately
be
two
hour
earlier
,
he
have
not
only
find
her
,
but
his
niece
into
the
bargain
;
for
such
be
the
wife
of
Mr
Fitzpatrick
,
who
have
run
away
with
her
five
year
before
,
out
of
the
custody
of
that
sage
lady
,
Madam
Western
.
  
<EOS>
now
this
lady
have
depart
from
the
inn
much
about
the
same
time
with
Sophia
;
for
,
have
be
wake
by
the
voice
of
her
husband
,
she
have
send
up
for
the
landlady
,
and
be
by
her
apprize
of
the
matter
,
have
bribe
the
good
woman
,
at
an
extravagant
price
,
to
furnish
her
with
horse
for
her
escape
.
<EOS>
such
prevalence
have
money
in
this
family
;
and
though
the
mistress
would
have
turn
away
her
maid
for
a
corrupt
hussy
,
if
she
have
know
as
much
as
the
reader
,
yet
she
be
no
more
proof
against
corruption
herself
than
poor
Susan
have
be
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Western
and
his
nephew
be
not
know
to
one
another
;
nor
indeed
would
the
former
have
take
any
notice
of
the
latter
if
he
have
know
him
;
for
,
this
be
a
steal
match
,
and
<EOS>
consequently
an
unnatural
one
in
the
opinion
of
the
good
squire
,
he
have
,
from
the
time
of
her
commit
it
,
abandon
the
poor
young
creature
,
who
be
then
no
more
than
eighteen
,
as
a
monster
,
and
have
never
since
suffer
her
to
be
name
in
his
presence
.
  
<EOS>
the
kitchen
be
now
a
scene
of
universal
confusion
,
western
enquire
after
his
daughter
,
and
Fitzpatrick
as
eagerly
after
his
wife
,
when
Jones
enter
the
room
,
unfortunately
have
Sophia
's
muff
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Western
see
Jones
,
he
set
up
the
same
holla
as
be
use
by
sportsman
when
their
game
be
in
view
.
<EOS>
He
then
immediately
run
up
and
lay
hold
of
Jones
,
cry
,
"
We
have
get
the
dog
fox
,
I
warrant
the
bitch
be
not
far
off
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
jargon
which
follow
for
some
minute
,
where
many
speak
different
thing
at
the
same
time
,
as
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
describe
,
so
would
it
be
no
less
unpleasant
to
read
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
have
,
at
length
,
shake
Mr
Western
off
,
and
some
of
the
company
have
interfere
between
them
,
our
heroe
protest
his
innocence
as
to
know
anything
of
the
lady
;
when
Parson
Supple
step
up
,
and
say
,
"
It
be
folly
to
deny
it
;
for
why
,
the
mark
of
guilt
be
in
thy
hand
.
<EOS>
I
will
myself
asseverate
and
bind
it
by
an
oath
,
that
the
muff
thou
bearest
in
thy
hand
belongeth
unto
Madam
Sophia
;
for
I
have
frequently
observe
her
,
of
later
day
,
to
bear
it
about
her
.
"
<EOS>
"
My
daughter
's
muff
!
"
cry
the
squire
in
a
rage
.
"
<EOS>
Hath
<EOS>
he
get
my
daughter
's
muff
?
<EOS>
bear
witness
<EOS>
the
good
be
find
upon
him
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
him
before
a
justice
of
peace
this
instant
.
<EOS>
where
be
my
daughter
,
villain
?
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
I
beg
you
would
be
pacify
.
<EOS>
the
muff
,
I
acknowledge
,
be
the
young
lady
's
;
but
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
have
never
see
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
at
these
word
Western
lose
all
patience
,
and
grow
inarticulate
with
rage
.
  
<EOS>
some
of
the
servant
have
acquaint
Fitzpatrick
who
Mr
Western
be
.
<EOS>
the
good
Irishman
,
therefore
,
think
he
have
now
an
opportunity
to
do
an
act
of
service
to
his
uncle
,
and
by
that
mean
may
possibly
obtain
his
favour
,
stept
up
to
Jones
,
and
cry
out
,
"
upon
my
conscience
,
sir
,
you
may
be
ashamed
of
deny
your
have
see
the
gentleman
's
daughter
before
my
face
,
when
you
know
I
find
you
there
upon
the
bed
together
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
,
turn
to
Western
,
he
offer
to
conduct
him
immediately
to
the
room
where
his
daughter
be
;
which
offer
be
accept
,
he
,
the
squire
,
the
parson
,
and
some
other
,
ascend
directly
to
Mrs
Waters
's
chamber
,
which
they
enter
with
no
less
violence
than
Mr
Fitzpatrick
have
do
before
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
lady
start
from
her
sleep
with
as
much
amazement
as
terror
,
and
beheld
at
her
bedside
a
figure
which
may
very
well
be
suppose
to
have
escape
out
of
Bedlam
.
<EOS>
such
wildness
and
confusion
be
in
the
look
of
Mr
Western
;
who
no
sooner
see
the
lady
than
he
start
back
,
shew
sufficiently
by
his
manner
,
before
he
speak
,
that
this
be
not
the
person
seek
after
.
  
<EOS>
so
much
more
tenderly
do
woman
value
their
reputation
than
their
person
,
that
,
though
the
latter
seem
now
in
more
danger
than
before
,
yet
,
as
the
former
be
secure
,
the
lady
scream
not
with
such
violence
as
she
have
do
on
the
other
occasion
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
no
sooner
find
herself
alone
than
she
abandon
all
thought
of
further
repose
;
and
,
as
she
have
sufficient
reason
to
be
dissatisfy
with
her
present
lodging
,
she
dress
herself
with
all
possible
expedition
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Western
now
proceed
to
search
the
whole
house
,
but
to
as
little
purpose
as
he
have
disturb
poor
Mrs
Waters
.
<EOS>
He
then
return
disconsolate
into
the
kitchen
,
where
he
find
Jones
in
the
custody
of
his
servant
.
  
<EOS>
this
violent
uproar
have
raise
all
the
people
in
the
house
,
though
it
be
yet
scarcely
daylight
.
<EOS>
among
these
be
a
grave
gentleman
,
who
have
the
honour
to
be
in
the
commission
of
the
peace
for
the
county
of
Worcester
.
<EOS>
of
which
Mr
Western
be
no
sooner
informed
than
he
offer
to
lay
his
complaint
before
him
.
<EOS>
the
justice
decline
execute
his
office
,
as
he
say
he
have
no
clerk
present
,
nor
no
book
about
justice
business
;
and
that
he
could
not
carry
all
the
law
in
his
head
about
steal
away
daughter
,
and
such
sort
of
thing
.
  
<EOS>
here
Mr
Fitzpatrick
offer
to
lend
him
his
assistance
,
inform
the
company
that
he
have
be
himself
breed
to
the
law
.
<EOS>
(
and
indeed
he
have
serve
three
year
as
clerk
to
an
attorney
in
the
north
of
Ireland
,
when
,
chuse
a
genteeler
walk
in
life
,
he
quit
his
master
,
come
over
to
England
,
and
set
up
that
business
which
require
no
apprenticeship
,
namely
,
that
of
a
gentleman
,
in
which
he
have
succeed
,
as
hath
be
already
partly
mention
.
)
  
<EOS>
Mr
Fitzpatrick
declare
that
the
law
concern
daughter
be
out
of
the
present
case
;
that
steal
a
muff
be
undoubtedly
felony
,
and
the
good
be
find
upon
the
person
,
be
sufficient
evidence
of
the
fact
.
  
<EOS>
the
magistrate
,
upon
the
encouragement
of
so
learn
a
coadjutor
,
and
upon
the
violent
intercession
of
the
squire
,
be
at
length
prevail
upon
to
seat
himself
in
the
chair
of
justice
,
where
be
place
,
upon
view
the
muff
which
Jones
still
hold
in
his
hand
,
and
upon
the
parson
's
swear
it
to
be
the
property
of
Mr
Western
,
he
desire
Mr
Fitzpatrick
to
draw
up
a
commitment
,
which
he
say
he
would
sign
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
now
desire
to
be
hear
,
which
be
at
last
,
with
difficulty
,
grant
him
.
<EOS>
He
then
produce
the
evidence
of
Mr
Partridge
,
as
to
the
finding
it
;
but
,
what
be
still
more
,
Susan
depose
that
Sophia
herself
have
deliver
the
muff
to
her
,
and
have
order
her
to
convey
it
into
the
chamber
where
Mr
Jones
have
find
it
.
  
<EOS>
whether
a
natural
love
of
justice
,
or
the
extraordinary
comeliness
of
Jones
,
have
work
on
Susan
to
make
the
discovery
,
I
will
not
determine
;
but
such
be
the
effect
of
her
evidence
,
that
the
magistrate
,
throw
himself
back
in
his
chair
,
declare
that
the
matter
be
now
altogether
as
clear
on
the
side
of
the
prisoner
as
it
have
before
be
against
him
:
with
which
the
parson
concur
,
say
,
the
Lord
forbid
he
should
be
instrumental
in
commit
an
innocent
person
to
durance
.
<EOS>
the
justice
then
arise
,
acquit
the
prisoner
,
and
break
up
the
court
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Western
now
give
every
one
present
a
hearty
curse
,
and
,
immediately
order
his
horse
,
depart
in
pursuit
of
his
daughter
,
without
take
the
least
notice
of
his
nephew
Fitzpatrick
,
or
return
any
answer
to
his
claim
of
kindred
,
notwithstanding
all
the
obligation
he
have
just
receive
from
that
gentleman
.
<EOS>
in
the
violence
,
moreover
,
of
his
hurry
,
and
of
his
passion
,
he
luckily
forget
to
demand
the
muff
of
Jones
:
<EOS>
I
say
luckily
;
for
he
would
have
die
on
the
spot
rather
than
have
part
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
likewise
,
with
his
friend
Partridge
,
set
forward
the
moment
he
have
pay
his
reckoning
,
in
quest
of
his
lovely
Sophia
,
whom
he
now
resolve
never
more
to
abandon
the
pursuit
of
.
<EOS>
nor
could
he
bring
himself
even
to
take
leave
of
Mrs
Waters
;
of
whom
he
detest
the
very
thought
,
as
she
have
be
,
though
not
designedly
,
the
occasion
of
his
miss
the
happy
interview
with
Sophia
,
to
whom
he
now
vow
eternal
constancy
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Mrs
Waters
,
she
take
the
opportunity
of
the
coach
which
be
go
to
Bath
;
for
which
place
she
set
out
in
company
with
the
two
irish
gentleman
,
the
landlady
kindly
lend
her
her
cloath
;
in
return
for
which
she
be
content
only
to
receive
about
double
their
value
,
as
a
recompence
for
the
loan
.
<EOS>
upon
the
road
she
be
perfectly
reconcile
to
Mr
Fitzpatrick
,
who
be
a
very
handsome
fellow
,
and
indeed
do
all
she
could
to
console
him
in
the
absence
of
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
thus
end
the
many
odd
adventure
which
Mr
Jones
encounter
at
his
inn
at
Upton
,
where
they
talk
,
to
this
day
,
of
the
beauty
and
lovely
behaviour
of
the
charming
Sophia
,
by
the
name
of
the
Somersetshire
angel
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
the
history
go
backward
.
 
<EOS>
before
we
proceed
any
farther
in
our
history
,
it
may
be
proper
to
look
a
little
back
,
in
order
to
account
for
the
extraordinary
appearance
of
Sophia
and
her
father
at
the
inn
at
Upton
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
may
be
pleased
to
remember
that
,
in
the
ninth
chapter
of
the
seventh
book
of
our
history
,
we
leave
Sophia
,
after
a
long
debate
between
love
and
duty
,
decide
the
cause
,
as
it
usually
,
I
believe
,
happen
,
in
favour
of
the
former
.
  
<EOS>
this
debate
have
arise
,
as
we
have
there
show
,
from
a
visit
which
her
father
have
just
before
make
her
,
in
order
to
force
her
consent
to
a
marriage
with
Blifil
;
and
which
he
have
understand
to
be
fully
imply
in
her
acknowledgment
"
that
she
neither
must
nor
could
refuse
any
absolute
command
of
his
.
"
  
<EOS>
now
from
this
visit
the
squire
retire
to
his
evening
potation
,
overjoy
at
the
success
he
have
gain
with
his
daughter
;
and
,
as
he
be
of
a
social
disposition
,
and
willing
to
have
partaker
in
his
happiness
,
the
beer
be
order
to
flow
very
liberally
into
the
kitchen
;
so
that
before
eleven
in
the
evening
there
be
not
a
single
person
sober
in
the
house
except
only
Mrs
Western
herself
and
the
charming
Sophia
.
  
<EOS>
early
in
the
morning
a
messenger
be
despatch
to
summon
Mr
Blifil
;
for
,
though
the
squire
imagine
that
young
gentleman
have
be
much
less
acquainted
than
he
really
be
with
the
former
aversion
of
his
daughter
,
as
he
have
not
,
however
,
yet
receive
her
consent
,
he
long
impatiently
to
communicate
it
to
him
,
not
doubt
but
that
the
intended
bride
herself
would
confirm
it
with
her
lip
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
wedding
,
it
have
the
evening
before
be
fix
,
by
the
male
party
,
to
be
celebrate
on
the
next
morning
save
one
.
  
<EOS>
Breakfast
be
now
set
forth
in
the
parlour
,
where
Mr
Blifil
attend
,
and
where
the
squire
and
his

likewise
be
assemble
;
and
now
Sophia
be
order
to
be
call

enter
the

,
and

that

<EOS>
"

cry
the

,
start
from

;
"

"
La

"
say
Mrs

,
with
true
political
coldness
,
"
you

passion

<EOS>
My
niece

I
suppose
,
be

out
into
the
garden
.
<EOS>
I
protest
you
be

so
unreasonable

that
it
be
impossible
to
live
in
the
house
with
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
nay
,
"
answer
the
squire
,
return
as
suddenly
to
himself
,
as
he
have
go
from
himself
;
"
if
that
be
all
the
matter
,
it
signify
not

;
but
,
upon
my
soul
,
my
mind
misgave
me
when
the
fellow
say
she
be
not
to
be
find
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
give
order
for
the
bell
to
be
ring
in
the
garden
,
and
sit
himself
contentedly
down
.
  
<EOS>
no
two
thing
could
be
more
the
reverse
of
each
other
than
be
the
brother
and
sister
in
most
instance
;
particularly
in
this
,
that
as
the
brother
never
foresee
anything
at
a
distance
,
but
be
most
sagacious
in
immediately
see
everything
<EOS>
the
moment
it
have
happen
;
so
the
sister
eternally
foresaw
at
a
distance
,
but
be
not
so
quick
-
sight
to
object
before
her
eye
.
<EOS>
of
both
these
the
reader
may
have
observe
example
:
and
,
indeed
,
both
their
several
talent
be
excessive
;
for
,
as
the
sister
often
foresaw
what
never
come
to
pass
,
so
the
brother
often
see
much
more
than
be
actually
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
not
however
the
case
at
present
.
<EOS>
the
same
report
be
bring
from
the
garden
as
before
have
be
bring
from
the
chamber
,
that
Madam
Sophia
be
not
to
be
find
.
  
<EOS>
the
squire
himself
now
sally
forth
,
and
begin
to
roar
forth
the
name
of
Sophia
as
loudly
,
and
in
as
hoarse
a
voice
,
as
whilome
do
hercule
that
of
Hylas
;
and
,
as
the
poet
tell
us
that
the
whole
shore
echo
back
the
name
of
that
beautiful
youth
,
so
do
the
house
,
the
garden
,
and
all
the
neighbouring
field
resound
nothing
but
the
name
of
Sophia
,
in
the
hoarse
voice
of
the
man
,
and
in
the
shrill
pipe
of
the
woman
;
while
echo
seem
so
pleased
to
repeat
the
beloved
sound
,
that
,
if
there
be
really
such
a
person
,
I
believe
Ovid
hath
belie
her
sex
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
reign
for
a
long
time
but
confusion
;
till
at
last
the
squire
,
have
sufficiently
spend
his
breath
,
return
to
the
parlour
,
where
he
find
Mrs
Western
and
Mr
Blifil
,
and
throw
himself
,
with
the
utmost
dejection
in
his
countenance
,
into
a
great
chair
.
  
<EOS>
here
Mrs
Western
begin
to
apply
the
follow
consolation
:
  
<EOS>
"
brother
,
I
be
sorry
for
what
hath
happen
;
and
that
my
niece
should
have
behave
herself
in
a
manner
so
unbecome
her
family
;
but
it
be
all
your
own
doing
,
and
you
have
nobody
to
thank
but
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
know
she
hath
be
educate
always
in
a
manner
directly
contrary
to
my
advice
,
and
now
you
see
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
have
I
not
a
thousand
time
argue
with
you
about
give
my
niece
her
own
will
?
<EOS>
but
you
know
I
never
could
prevail
upon
you
;
and
when
I
have
take
so
much
pain
to
eradicate
her
headstrong
opinion
,
and
to
rectify
your
error
in
policy
,
you
know
she
be
take
out
of
my
hand
;
so
that
I
have
nothing
to
answer
for
.
<EOS>
have
I
be
trust
entirely
with
the
care
of
her
education
,
no
such
accident
as
this
have
ever
befall
you
;
so
that
you
must
comfort
yourself
by
think
it
be
all
your
own
doing
;
and
,
indeed
,
what
else
could
be
expect
from
such
indulgence
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
zounds
!
sister
,
"
answer
he
,
"
you
be
enough
to
make
one
mad
.
<EOS>
have
I
indulge
her
?
<EOS>
have
I
give
her
her
will
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
longer
ago
than
last
night
that
I
threaten
,
if
she
disobey
me
,
to
confine
her
to
her
chamber
upon
bread
and
water
as
long
as
she
live
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
provoke
the
patience
of
Job
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
ever
mortal
hear
the
like
?
"
reply
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
brother
,
if
I
have
not
the
patience
of
fifty
job
,
you
would
make
me
forget
all
decency
and
decorum
.
<EOS>
why
would
you
interfere
?
<EOS>
do
I
not
beg
you
,
do
I
not
intreat
you
,
to
leave
the
whole
conduct
to
me
?
<EOS>
You
have
defeat
all
the
operation
of
the
campaign
by
one
false
step
.
<EOS>
Would
any
man
in
his
sense
have
provoke
a
daughter
by
such
threat
as
these
?
<EOS>
how
often
have
I
tell
you
that
english
woman
be
not
to
be
treat
like
ciracessian
[
*
]
slave
.
<EOS>
We
have
the
protection
of
the
world
;
we
be
to
be
win
by
gentle
mean
only
,
and
not
to
be
hector
,
and
bully
,
and
beat
into
compliance
.
<EOS>
I
thank
Heaven
no
salique
law
govern
here
.
<EOS>
brother
,
you
have
a
roughness
in
your
manner
which
no
woman
but
myself
would
bear
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
wonder
my
niece
be
frightened
and
terrify
into
take
this
measure
;
and
,
to
speak
honestly
,
I
think
my
niece
will
be
justify
to
the
world
for
what
she
hath
do
.
<EOS>
I
repeat
it
to
you
again
,
brother
,
you
must
comfort
yourself
by
rememb'ring
that
it
be
all
your
own
fault
.
<EOS>
how
often
have
I
advise
"
here
Western
rise
hastily
from
his
chair
,
and
,
vent
two
or
three
horrid
imprecation
,
run
out
of
the
room
.
    
<EOS>
[
*
]
<EOS>
possibly
circassian
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
be
depart
,
his
sister
express
more
bitterness
(
if
possible
)
against
him
than
she
have
do
while
he
be
present
;
for
the
truth
of
which
she
appeal
to
Mr
Blifil
,
who
,
with
great
complacence
,
acquiesce
entirely
in
all
she
say
;
but
excuse
all
the
fault
of
Mr
Western
,
"
as
they
must
be
consider
,
"
he
say
,
"
to
have
proceed
from
the
too
inordinate
fondness
of
a
father
,
which
must
be
allow
the
name
of
an
amiable
weakness
.
"
<EOS>
"
so
much
the
more
inexcuseable
,
"
answer
the
lady
;
"
for
whom
doth
he
ruin
by
his
fondness
but
his
own
child
?
"
<EOS>
to
which
Blifil
immediately
agree
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Western
then
begin
to
express
great
confusion
on
the
account
of
Mr
Blifil
,
and
of
the
usage
which
he
have
receive
from
a
family
to
which
he
intend
so
much
honour
.
<EOS>
on
this
subject
she
treat
the
folly
of
her
niece
with
great
severity
;
but
conclude
with
throw
the
whole
on
her
brother
,
who
,
she
say
,
be
inexcuseable
to
have
proceed
so
far
without
well
assurance
of
his
daughter
's
consent
:
"
but
he
be
(
say
she
)
always
of
a
violent
,
headstrong
temper
;
and
I
can
scarce
forgive
myself
for
all
the
advice
I
have
throw
away
upon
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
much
of
this
kind
of
conversation
,
which
,
perhaps
,
would
not
greatly
entertain
the
reader
,
be
it
here
particularly
relate
,
Mr
Blifil
take
his
leave
and
return
home
,
not
highly
pleased
with
his
disappointment
:
which
,
however
,
the
philosophy
which
he
have
acquire
from
Square
,
and
the
religion
infuse
into
him
by
Thwackum
,
together
with
somewhat
else
,
teach
him
to
bear
rather
better
than
more
passionate
lover
bear
these
kind
of
evil
.
    
<EOS>
the
escape
of
Sophia
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
time
to
look
after
Sophia
;
whom
the
reader
,
if
he
love
her
half
so
well
as
I
do
,
will
rejoice
to
find
escape
from
the
clutch
of
her
passionate
father
,
and
from
those
of
her
dispassionate
lover
.
  
<EOS>
twelve
time
do
the
iron
register
of
time
beat
on
the
sonorous
bell
-
metal
,
summon
the
ghost
to
rise
and
walk
their
nightly
round
.
 
<EOS>
in
plainer
language
,
it
be
twelve
o'clock
,
and
all
the
family
,
as
we
have
say
,
lie
bury
in
drink
and
sleep
,
except
only
Mrs
Western
,
who
be
deeply
engage
in
read
a
political
pamphlet
,
and
except
our
heroine
,
who
now
softly
steal
down
-
stair
,
and
,
have
unbarred
and
unlock
one
of
the
house
-
door
,
sally
forth
,
and
hasten
to
the
place
of
appointment
.
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
many
pretty
art
which
lady
sometimes
practise
,
to
display
their
fear
on
every
little
occasion
(
almost
as
many
as
the
other
sex
use
to
conceal
theirs
)
,
certainly
there
be
a
degree
of
courage
which
not
only
become
a
woman
,
but
be
often
necessary
to
enable
her
to
discharge
her
duty
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
indeed
,
the
idea
of
fierceness
,
and
not
of
bravery
,
which
destroy
the
female
character
;
for
who
can
read
the
story
of
the
justly
celebrate
Arria
without
conceive
as
high
an
opinion
of
her
gentleness
and
tenderness
as
of
her
fortitude
?
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
perhaps
,
many
a
woman
who
shriek
at
a
mouse
,
or
a
rat
,
may
be
capable
of
poison
a
husband
;
or
,
what
be
bad
,
of
drive
him
to
poison
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
,
with
all
the
gentleness
which
a
woman
can
have
,
have
all
the
spirit
which
she
ought
to
have
.
<EOS>
when
,
therefore
,
she
come
to
the
place
of
appointment
,
and
,
instead
of
meet
her
maid
,
as
be
agree
,
see
a
man
ride
directly
up
to
her
,
she
neither
scream
out
nor
faint
away
:
not
that
her
pulse
then
beat
with
its
usual
regularity
;
for
she
be
,
at
first
,
under
some
surprize
and
apprehension
:
but
these
be
relieve
almost
as
soon
as
raise
,
when
the
man
,
pull
off
his
hat
,
ask
her
,
in
a
very
submissive
manner
,
"
if
her
ladyship
do
not
expect
to
meet
another
lady
?
"
and
then
proceed
to
inform
her
that
he
be
send
to
conduct
her
to
that
lady
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
could
have
no
possible
suspicion
of
any
falsehood
in
this
account
:
she
therefore
mount
resolutely
behind
the
fellow
,
who
convey
her
safe
to
a
town
about
five
mile
distant
,
where
she
have
the
satisfaction
of
find
the
good
Mrs
Honour
:
for
,
as
the
soul
of
the
waiting
-
woman
be
wrapt
up
in
those
very
habiliment
which
use
to
enwrap
her
body
,
she
could
by
no
mean
bring
herself
to
trust
them
out
of
her
sight
.
<EOS>
upon
these
,
therefore
,
she
keep
guard
in
person
,
while
she
detach
the
aforesaid
fellow
after
her
mistress
,
have
give
him
all
proper
instruction
.
  
<EOS>
They
now
debate
what
course
to
take
,
in
order
to
avoid
the
pursuit
of
Mr
Western
,
who
they
know
would
send
after
them
in
a
few
hour
.
<EOS>
the
London
road
have
such
charm
for
Honour
,
that
she
be
desirous
of
go
on
directly
;
allege
that
,
as
Sophia
could
not
be
miss
till
eight
or
nine
the
next
morning
,
her
pursuer
would
not
be
able
to
overtake
her
,
even
though
they
know
which
way
she
have
go
.
<EOS>
but
Sophia
have
too
much
at
stake
to
venture
anything
to
chance
;
nor
do
she
dare
trust
too
much
to
her
tender
limb
,
in
a
contest
which
be
to
be
decide
only
by
swiftness
.
<EOS>
She
resolve
,
therefore
,
to
travel
across
the
country
,
for
at
least
twenty
or
thirty
mile
,
and
then
to
take
the
direct
road
to
London
.
<EOS>
so
,
have
hire
horse
to
go
twenty
mile
one
way
,
when
she
intend
to
go
twenty
mile
the
other
,
she
set
forward
with
the
same
guide
behind
whom
she
have
ride
from
her
father
's
house
;
the
guide
have
now
take
up
behind
him
,
in
the
room
of
Sophia
,
a
much
heavy
,
as
well
as
much
less
lovely
burden
;
be
,
indeed
,
a
huge
portmanteau
,
well
stuff
with
those
outside
ornament
,
by
mean
of
which
the
fair
Honour
hope
to
gain
many
conquest
,
and
,
finally
,
to
make
her
fortune
in
London
city
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
have
go
about
two
hundred
pace
from
the
inn
on
the
London
road
,
Sophia
ride
up
to
the
guide
,
and
,
with
a
voice
much
full
of
honey
than
be
ever
that
of
Plato
,
though
his
mouth
be
suppose
to
have
be
a
bee
-
hive
,
beg
him
to
take
the
first
turning
which
lead
towards
Bristol
.
  
<EOS>
reader
,
I
be
not
superstitious
,
nor
any
great
believer
of
modern
miracle
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
,
therefore
,
deliver
the
following
as
a
certain
truth
;
for
,
indeed
,
I
can
scarce
credit
it
myself
:
but
the
fidelity
of
an
historian
oblige
me
to
relate
what
hath
be
confidently
assert
.
<EOS>
the
horse
,
then
,
on
which
the
guide
ride
,
be
report
to
have
be
so
charm
by
Sophia
's
voice
,
that
he
make
a
full
stop
,
and
express
an
unwillingness
to
proceed
any
farther
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
,
however
,
the
fact
may
be
true
,
and
less
miraculous
than
it
hath
be
represent
;
since
the
natural
cause
seem
adequate
to
the
effect
:
for
,
as
the
guide
at
that
moment
desist
from
a
constant
application
of
his
armed
right
heel
(
for
,
like
Hudibras
,
he
wear
but
one
spur
)
<EOS>
,
it
be
more
than
possible
that
this
omission
alone
may
occasion
the
beast
to
stop
,
especially
as
this
be
very
frequent
with
him
at
other
time
.
  
<EOS>
but
if
the
voice
of
Sophia
have
really
an
effect
on
the
horse
,
it
have
very
little
on
the
rider
.
<EOS>
He
answer
somewhat
surlily
,
"
that
measter
have
order
him
to
go
a
different
way
,
and
that
he
should
lose
his
place
if
he
go
any
other
than
that
he
be
order
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sophia
,
find
all
her
persuasion
have
no
effect
,
begin
now
to
add
irresistible
charm
to
her
voice
;
charm
which
,
accord
to
the
proverb
,
make
the
old
mare
trot
,
instead
of
stand
still
;
charm
!
<EOS>
to
which
modern
age
have
attribute
all
that
irresistible
force
which
the
antient
impute
to
perfect
oratory
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
she
promise
she
would
reward
him
to
his
utmost
expectation
.
  
<EOS>
the
lad
be
not
totally
deaf
to
these
promise
;
but
he
dislike
their
be
indefinite
;
for
,
though
perhaps
he
have
never
hear
that
word
,
yet
that
,
in
fact
,
be
his
objection
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
gentlevolk
do
not
consider
the
case
of
poor
volk
;
that
he
have
like
to
have
be
turn
away
the
other
day
,
for
ride
about
the
country
with
a
gentleman
from
Squire
Allworthy
's
,
who
do
not
reward
him
as
he
should
have
do
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
with
whom
?
"
say
Sophia
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
with
a
gentleman
from
Squire
Allworthy
's
,
"
repeat
the
lad
;
"
the
squire
's
son
,
I
think
they
call
"
un
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Whither
?
<EOS>
which
way
do
he
go
?
"
say
Sophia
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
a
little
o
'
one
side
o
'
Bristol
,
about
twenty
mile
off
,
"
answer
the
lad
.
 
<EOS>
"
guide
me
,
"
say
Sophia
,
"
to
the
same
place
,
and
I
will
give
thee
a
guinea
,
or
two
,
if
one
be
not
sufficient
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
to
be
certain
,
"
say
the
boy
,
"
it
be
honestly
worth
two
,
when
your
ladyship
consider
what
a
risk
I
run
;
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
if
your
ladyship
will
promise
me
the
two
guinea
,
I
will
e'en
venture
:
to
be
certain
it
be
a
sinful
thing
to
ride
about
my
measter
's
horse
;
but
one
comfort
be
,
I
can
only
be
turn
away
,
and
two
guinea
will
partly
make
me
amend
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
bargain
be
thus
strike
,
the
lad
turn
aside
into
the
Bristol
road
,
and
Sophia
set
forward
in
pursuit
of
Jones
,
highly
contrary
to
the
remonstrance
of
Mrs
Honour
,
who
have
much
more
desire
to
see
London
than
to
see
Mr
Jones
:
for
indeed
she
be
not
his
friend
with
her
mistress
,
as
he
have
be
guilty
of
some
neglect
in
certain
pecuniary
civility
,
which
be
by
custom
due
to
the
waiting
-
gentlewoman
in
all
love
affair
,
and
more
especially
in
those
of
a
clandestine
kind
.
<EOS>
this
we
impute
rather
to
the
carelessness
of
his
temper
than
to
any
want
of
generosity
;
but
perhaps
she
derive
it
from
the
latter
motive
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
that
she
hate
him
very
bitterly
on
that
account
,
and
resolve
to
take
every
opportunity
of
injure
him
with
her
mistress
.
<EOS>
It
be
therefore
highly
unlucky
for
her
,
that
she
have
go
to
the
very
same
town
and
inn
whence
Jones
have
start
,
and
still
more
unlucky
be
she
in
have
stumble
on
the
same
guide
,
and
on
this
accidental
discovery
which
Sophia
have
make
.
  
<EOS>
Our
traveller
arrive
at
Hambrook
[
*
]
<EOS>
at
the
break
of
day
,
where
Honour
be
against
her
will
charge
to
enquire
the
route
which
Mr
Jones
have
take
.
<EOS>
of
this
,
indeed
,
the
guide
himself
could
have
inform
them
;
but
Sophia
,
I
know
not
for
what
reason
,
never
ask
him
the
question
.
   
<EOS>
[
*
]
<EOS>
this
be
the
village
where
Jones
meet
the
Quaker
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mrs
Honour
have
make
her
report
from
the
landlord
,
Sophia
,
with
much
difficulty
,
procure
some
indifferent
horse
,
which
bring
her
to
the
inn
where
Jones
have
be
confine
rather
by
the
misfortune
of
meet
with
a
surgeon
than
by
have
meet
with
a
broken
head
.
  
<EOS>
here
Honour
,
be
again
charge
with
a
commission
of
enquiry
,
have
no
sooner
apply
herself
to
the
landlady
,
and
have
describe
the
person
of
Mr
Jones
,
than
that
sagacious
woman
begin
,
in
the
vulgar
phrase
,
to
smell
a
rat
.
<EOS>
when
Sophia
therefore
enter
the
room
,
instead
of
answer
the
maid
,
the
landlady
,
address
herself
to
the
mistress
,
begin
the
follow
speech
:
"
<EOS>
good
lack
-
a
-
day
!
<EOS>
why
there
now
,
who
would
have
think
it
?
<EOS>
I
protest
the
lovely
couple
that
ever
eye
beheld
.
<EOS>
I
-
fackin
,
madam
<EOS>
,
it
be
no
wonder
the
squire
run
on
so
about
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
indeed
you
be
the
fine
lady
in
the
world
,
and
to
be
sure
<EOS>
so
you
be
.
<EOS>
mercy
on
him
,
poor
heart
!
<EOS>
I
bepitie
him
,
so
I
do
,
when
he
use
to
hug
his
pillow
,
and
call
it
his
dear
Madam
Sophia
.
<EOS>
I
do
all
I
could
to
dissuade
him
from
go
to
the
war
:
I
tell
him
there
be
man
enow
that
be
good
for
nothing
else
but
to
be
kill
,
that
have
not
the
love
of
such
fine
lady
.
"
<EOS>
"
sure
,
"
say
Sophia
,
"
the
good
woman
be
distract
.
"
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
cry
the
landlady
,
"
I
be
not
distract
.
<EOS>
what
,
doth
your
ladyship
think
I
do
not
know
then
?
<EOS>
I
assure
you
he
tell
me
all
.
"
<EOS>
"
what
saucy
fellow
,
"
cry
Honour
,
"
tell
you
anything
of
my
lady
?
"
<EOS>
"
no
saucy
fellow
,
"
answer
the
landlady
,
"
but
the
young
gentleman
you
enquire
after
,
and
a
very
pretty
young
gentleman
he
be
,
and
he
love
Madam
Sophia
Western
to
the
bottom
of
his
soul
.
"
<EOS>
"
He
love
my
lady
!
<EOS>
I
would
have
you
to
know
,
woman
,
she
be
meat
for
his
master
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Honour
,
"
say
Sophia
,
interrupt
her
,
"
do
not
be
angry
with
the
good
woman
;
she
intend
no
harm
.
"
<EOS>
"
no
,
marry
,
do
not
I
,
"
answer
the
landlady
,
embolden
by
the
soft
accent
of
Sophia
;
and
then
launch
into
a
long
narrative
too
tedious
to
be
here
set
down
,
in
which
some
passage
dropt
that
give
a
little
offence
to
Sophia
,
and
much
more
to
her
waiting
-
woman
,
who
hence
take
occasion
to
abuse
poor
Jones
to
her
mistress
the
moment
they
be
alone
together
,
say
,
"
that
he
must
be
a
very
pitiful
fellow
,
and
could
have
no
love
for
a
lady
,
whose
name
he
would
thus
prostitute
in
an
ale
-
house
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sophia
do
not
see
his
behaviour
in
so
very
disadvantageous
a
light
,
and
be
perhaps
more
pleased
with
the
violent
rapture
of
his
love
(
which
the
landlady
exaggerate
as
much
as
she
have
do
every
other
circumstance
)
than
she
be
offend
with
the
rest
;
and
indeed
she
impute
the
whole
to
the
extravagance
,
or
rather
ebullience
,
of
his
passion
,
and
to
the
openness
of
his
heart
.
  
<EOS>
this
incident
,
however
,
be
afterwards
revive
in
her
mind
,
and
place
in
the
most
odious
colour
by
Honour
,
serve
to
heighten
and
give
credit
to
those
unlucky
occurrence
at
Upton
,
and
assist
the
waiting
-
woman
in
her
endeavour
to
make
her
mistress
depart
from
that
inn
without
see
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
the
landlady
find
Sophia
intend
to
stay
no
longer
than
till
her
horse
be
ready
,
and
that
without
either
eating
or
drink
,
soon
withdraw
;
when
Honour
begin
to
take
her
mistress
to
task
(
for
indeed
she
use
great
freedom
)
,
and
after
a
long
harangue
,
in
which
she
remind
her
of
her
intention
to
go
to
London
,
and
give
frequent
hint
of
the
impropriety
of
pursue
a
young
fellow
,
she
at
last
conclude
with
this
serious
exhortation
:
"
for
heaven
's
sake
,
madam
,
consider
what
you
be
about
,
and
whither
you
be
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
advice
to
a
lady
who
have
already
ride
near
forty
mile
,
and
in
no
very
agreeable
season
,
may
seem
foolish
enough
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
suppose
she
have
well
consider
and
resolve
this
already
;
nay
,
Mrs
Honour
,
by
the
hint
she
throw
out
,
seem
to
think
so
;
and
this
I
doubt
not
be
the
opinion
of
many
reader
,
who
have
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
be
long
since
well
convince
of
the
purpose
of
our
heroine
,
and
have
heartily
condemn
her
for
it
as
a
wanton
baggage
.
  
<EOS>
but
in
reality
this
be
not
the
case
.
<EOS>
Sophia
have
be
lately
so
distract
between
hope
and
fear
,
her
duty
and
love
to
her
father
,
her
hatred
to
Blifil
,
her
compassion
,
and
(
why
should
we
not
confess
the
truth
?
)
<EOS>
her
love
for
Jones
;
which
last
the
behaviour
of
her
father
,
of
her
aunt
,
of
every
one
else
,
and
more
particularly
of
Jones
himself
,
have
blow
into
a
flame
,
that
her
mind
be
in
that
confused
state
which
may
be
truly
say
to
make
us
ignorant
of
what
we
do
,
or
whither
we
go
,
or
rather
<EOS>
,
indeed
,
indifferent
as
to
the
consequence
of
either
.
  
<EOS>
the
prudent
and
sage
advice
of
her
maid
produce
,
however
,
some
cool
reflection
;
and
she
at
length
determine
to
go
to
Gloucester
,
and
thence
to
proceed
directly
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
unluckily
,
a
few
mile
before
she
enter
that
town
,
she
meet
the
hack
-
attorney
,
who
,
as
be
before
mention
,
have
dine
there
with
Mr
Jones
.
<EOS>
this
fellow
,
be
well
known
to
Mrs
Honour
,
stopt
and
speak
to
her
;
of
which
Sophia
at
that
time
take
little
notice
,
more
than
to
enquire
who
he
be
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
have
have
a
more
particular
account
from
Honour
of
this
man
afterwards
at
Gloucester
,
and
hearing
of
the
great
expedition
he
usually
make
in
travel
,
for
which
(
as
hath
be
before
observe
)
<EOS>
he
be
particularly
famous
;
recollect
,
likewise
,
that
she
have
overhear
Mrs
Honour
inform
him
that
they
be
go
to
Gloucester
,
she
begin
to
fear
lest
her
father
may
,
by
this
fellow
's
mean
,
be
able
to
trace
her
to
that
city
;
wherefore
,
if
she
should
there
strike
into
the
London
road
,
she
apprehend
he
would
certainly
be
able
to
overtake
her
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
alter
her
resolution
;
and
,
have
hire
horse
to
go
a
week
's
journey
a
way
which
she
do
not
intend
to
travel
,
she
again
set
forward
after
a
light
refreshment
,
contrary
to
the
desire
and
earnest
entreaty
of
her
maid
,
and
to
the
no
less
vehement
remonstrance
of
Mrs
Whitefield
,
who
,
from
good
breeding
,
or
perhaps
from
good
nature
(
for
the
poor
young
lady
appear
much
fatigue
)
,
press
her
very
heartily
to
stay
that
evening
at
Gloucester
.
  
<EOS>
have
refresh
herself
only
with
some
tea
,
and
with
lie
about
two
hour
on
the
bed
,
while
her
horse
be
get
ready
,
she
resolutely
leave
Mrs
Whitefield
's
about
eleven
at
night
,
and
,
strike
directly
into
the
Worcester
road
,
within
less
than
four
hour
arrive
at
that
very
inn
where
we
last
see
her
.
  
<EOS>
have
thus
trace
our
heroine
very
particularly
back
from
her
departure
,
till
her
arrival
at
Upton
,
we
shall
in
a
very
few
word
bring
her
father
to
the
same
place
;
who
,
have
receive
the
first
scent
from
the
post
-
boy
,
who
conduct
his
daughter
to
Hambrook
,
very
easily
trace
her
afterwards
to
Gloucester
;
whence
he
pursue
her
to
Upton
,
as
he
have
learn
Mr
Jones
have
take
that
route
(
for
Partridge
,
to
use
the
squire
's
expression
,
leave
everywhere
a
strong
scent
behind
him
)
,
and
he
doubt
not
in
the
least
but
Sophia
travel
,
or
,
as
he
phrase
it
,
run
,
the
same
way
.
<EOS>
He
use
indeed
a
very
coarse
expression
,
which
nee
not
be
here
insert
;
as
fox
-
hunter
,
who
alone
will
understand
it

will
easily
suggest
it

BOOK
XI
.
  
<EOS>
contain
about
three
day
.
    
<EOS>
a
crust
for
the
critic
.
 
<EOS>
in
our
last
initial
chapter
we
may
be
suppose
to
have
treat
that
formidable
set
of
man
who
be
call
critic
with
more
freedom
than
become
us
;
since
they
exact
,
and
indeed
generally
receive
,
great
condescension
from
author
.
<EOS>
We
shall
in
this
,
therefore
,
give
the
reason
of
our
conduct
to
this
august
body
;
and
here
we
shall
,
perhaps
,
place
them
in
a
light
in
which
they
have
not
hitherto
be
see
.
  
<EOS>
this
word
critic
be
of
greek
derivation
,
and
signifie
judgment
.
<EOS>
hence
I
presume
some
person
who
have
not
understand
the
original
,
and
have
see
the
english
translation
of
the
primitive
,
have
conclude
that
it
mean
judgment
in
the
legal
sense
,
in
which
it
be
frequently
use
as
equivalent
to
condemnation
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
the
rather
inclined
to
be
of
that
opinion
,
as
the
great
number
of
critic
hath
of
late
year
be
find
amongst
the
lawyer
.
<EOS>
many
of
these
gentleman
,
from
despair
,
perhaps
,
of
ever
rise
to
the
bench
in
Westminster
-
hall
,
have
place
themselves
on
the
bench
at
the
playhouse
,
where
they
have
exert
their
judicial
capacity
,
and
have
give
judgment
,
i.e.
,
condemn
without
mercy
.
  
<EOS>
the
gentleman
would
,
perhaps
,
be
well
enough
pleased
,
if
we
be
to
leave
them
thus
compare
to
one
of
the
most
important
and
honourable
office
in
the
commonwealth
,
and
,
if
we
intend
to
apply
to
their
favour
,
we
would
do
so
;
but
,
as
we
design
to
deal
very
sincerely
and
plainly
too
with
them
,
we
must
remind
them
of
another
officer
of
justice
of
a
much
low
rank
;
to
whom
,
as
they
not
only
pronounce
,
but
execute
,
their
own
judgment
,
they
bear
likewise
some
remote
resemblance
.
  
<EOS>
but
in
reality
there
be
another
light
,
in
which
these
modern
critic
may
,
with
great
justice
and
propriety
,
be
see
;
and
this
be
that
of
a
common
slanderer
.
<EOS>
if
a
person
who
pry
into
the
character
of
other
,
with
no
other
design
but
to
discover
their
fault
,
and
to
publish
them
to
the
world
,
deserve
the
title
of
a
slanderer
of
the
reputation
of
man
,
why
should
not
a
critic
,
who
read
with
the
same
malevolent
view
,
be
as
properly
stile
the
slanderer
of
the
reputation
of
book
?
  
<EOS>
Vice
hath
not
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
a
more
abject
slave
;
society
produce
not
a
more
odious
vermin
;
nor
can
the
devil
receive
a
guest
more
worthy
of
him
,
nor
possibly
more
welcome
to
him
,
than
a
slanderer
.
<EOS>
the
world
,
I
be
afraid
,
regard
not
this
monster
with
half
the
abhorrence
which
he
deserve
;
and
I
be
more
afraid
to
assign
the
reason
of
this
criminal
lenity
show
towards
him
;
yet
it
be
certain
that
the
thief
look
innocent
in
the
comparison
;
<EOS>
nay
,
the
murderer
himself
can
seldom
stand
in
competition
with
his
guilt
:
for
slander
be
a
more
cruel
weapon
than
a
sword
,
as
the
wound
which
the
former
give
be
always
incurable
.
<EOS>
one
method
,
indeed
,
there
be
of
killing
,
and
that
the
base
and
most
execrable
of
all
,
which
bear
an
exact
analogy
to
the
vice
here
disclaim
against
,
and
that
be
poison
:
a
means
of
revenge
so
base
,
and
yet
so
horrible
,
that
it
be
once
wisely
distinguish
by
our
law
from
all
other
murder
,
in
the
peculiar
severity
of
the
punishment
.
  
<EOS>
besides
the
dreadful
mischief
do
by
slander
,
and
the
baseness
of
the
mean
by
which
they
be
effect
,
there
be
other
circumstance
that
highly
aggravate
its
atrocious
quality
;
for
it
often
proceed
from
no
provocation
,
and
seldom
promise
itself
any
reward
,
unless
some
black
and
infernal
mind
may
propose
a
reward
in
the
thought
of
have
procure
the
ruin
and
misery
of
another
.
  
<EOS>
Shakespear
hath
nobly
touch
this
vice
,
when
he
say
    
"
<EOS>
who
steal
my
purse
steal
trash
;
"
t
be
something
,
nothing
<EOS>
;
  
'
Twas
mine
,
'
tis
his
,
and
hath
be
slave
to
thousand
:
  
<EOS>
but
he
that
filch
from
me
my
good
name
  
robs
me
of
that
which
<EOS>
not
enriches
him
,
  
but
makes
me
POOR
INDEED
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
all
this
my
good
reader
will
doubtless
agree
;
but
much
of
it
will
probably
seem
too
severe
,
when
apply
to
the
slanderer
of
book
.
<EOS>
but
let
it
here
be
consider
that
both
proceed
from
the
same
wicked
disposition
of
mind
,
and
be
alike
void
of
the
excuse
of
temptation
.
<EOS>
nor
shall
we
conclude
the
injury
do
this
way
to
be
very
slight
,
when
we
consider
a
book
as
the
author
's
offspring
,
and
indeed
as
the
child
of
his
brain
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
who
hath
suffer
his
muse
to
continue
hitherto
in
a
virgin
state
can
have
but
a
very
inadequate
idea
of
this
kind
of
paternal
fondness
.
<EOS>
to
such
we
may
parody
the
tender
exclamation
of
Macduff
,
"
alas
!
<EOS>
Thou
hast
write
no
book
.
"
<EOS>
but
the
author
whose
muse
hath
bring
forth
will
feel
the
pathetic
strain
,
perhaps
will
accompany
me
with
tear
(
especially
if
his
darling
be
already
no
more
)
,
while
I
mention
the
uneasiness
with
which
the
big
muse
bear
about
her
burden
,
the
painful
labour
with
which
she
produce
it
,
and
,
lastly
,
the
care
,
the
fondness
,
with
which
the
tender
father
nourish
his
favourite
,
till
it
be
bring
to
maturity
,
and
produce
into
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
there
any
paternal
fondness
which
seem
less
to
savour
of
absolute
instinct
,
and
which
may
so
well
be
reconcile
to
worldly
wisdom
,
as
this
.
<EOS>
these
child
may
most
truly
be
call
the
riches
of
their
father
;
and
many
of
them
have
with
true
filial
piety
feed
their
parent
in
his
old
age
:
so
that
not
only
the
affection
,
but
the
interest
,
of
the
author
may
be
highly
injure
by
these
slanderer
,
whose
poisonous
breath
bring
his
book
to
an
untimely
end
.
  
<EOS>
lastly
,
the
slander
of
a
book
be
,
in
truth
,
the
slander
of
the
author
:
for
,
as
no
one
can
call
another
bastard
,
without
call
the
mother
a
whore
,
so
neither
can
any
one
give
the
name
of
sad
stuff
,
horrid
nonsense
,
&
c.
,
to
a
book
,
without
call
the
author
a
blockhead
;
which
,
though
in
a
moral
sense
it
be
a
preferable
appellation
to
that
of
villain
,
be
perhaps
rather
more
injurious
to
his
worldly
interest
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
however
ludicrous
all
this
may
appear
to
some
,
other
,
I
doubt
not
,
will
feel
and
acknowledge
the
truth
of
it
;
<EOS>
nay
,
may
,
perhaps
,
think
I
have
not
treat
the
subject
with
decent
solemnity
;
but
surely
a
man
may
speak
truth
with
a
smile
countenance
.
<EOS>
in
reality
,
to
depreciate
a
book
maliciously
,
or
even
wantonly
,
be
at
least
a
very
ill
-
natured
office
;
and
a
morose
snarl
critic
may
,
I
believe
,
be
suspect
to
be
a
bad
man
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
therefore
endeavour
,
in
the
remain
part
of
this
chapter
,
to
explain
the
mark
of
this
character
,
and
to
show
what
criticism
I
here
intend
to
obviate
:
for
I
can
never
be
understand
,
unless
by
the
very
person
here
mean
,
to
insinuate
that
there
be
no
proper
judge
of
writing
,
or
to
endeavour
to
exclude
from
the
commonwealth
of
literature
any
of
those
noble
critic
to
whose
labours
the
learned
world
be
so
greatly
indebted
.
<EOS>
such
be
Aristotle
,
horace
,
and
Longinus
,
among
the
antient
,
Dacier
and
Bossu
among
the
French
,
and
some
perhaps
among
us
;
who
have
certainly
be
duly
authorise
to
execute
at
least
a
judicial
authority
in
foro
literario
.
  
<EOS>
but
without
ascertain
all
the
proper
qualification
of
a
critic
,
which
I
have
touch
on
elsewhere
,
I
think
I
may
very
boldly
object
to
the
censure
of
any
one
past
upon
work
which
he
hath
not
himself
read
.
<EOS>
such
censurer
as
these
,
whether
they
speak
from
their
own
guess
or
suspicion
,
or
from
the
report
and
opinion
of
other
,
may
properly
be
say
to
slander
the
reputation
of
the
book
they
condemn
.
  
<EOS>
such
may
likewise
be
suspect
of
deserve
this
character
,
who
,
without
assign
any
particular
fault
,
condemn
the
whole
in
general
defamatory
term
;
such
as
vile
,
dull
,
d####d
stuff
,
&
c.
,
and
particularly
by
the
use
of
the
monosyllable
low
;
a
word
which
become
the
mouth
of
no
critic
who
be
not
right
honourable
.
  
<EOS>
again
,
though
there
may
be
some
fault
justly
assign
in
the
work
,
yet
,
if
those
be
not
in
the
most
essential
part
,
or
if
they
be
compensate
by
great
beauty
,
it
will
savour
rather
of
the
malice
of
a
slanderer
than
of
the
judgment
of
a
true
critic
to
pass
a
severe
sentence
upon
the
whole
,
merely
on
account
of
some
vicious
part
.
<EOS>
this
be
directly
contrary
to
the
sentiment
of
horace
:
  
Verum
ubi
plura
nitent
in
carmine
,
non
ego
paucis
     
<EOS>
Offendor
maculis
,
quas
aut
incuria
fudit
,
     
Aut
humana
parum
cavit
natura
         
<EOS>
but
where
the
beauty
,
more
in
number
,
shine
,
     
I
be
not
angry
,
when
a
casual
line
     
(
that
with
some
trivial
fault
unequal
flow
)
     
a
careless
hand
or
human
frailty
show
.
 
<EOS>
MR
FRANCIS
.
  
<EOS>
for
,
as
Martial
say
,
Aliter
non
fit
,
Avite
,
liber
.
<EOS>
no
book
can
be
otherwise
compose
.
<EOS>
all
beauty
of
character
,
as
well
as
of
countenance
,
and
indeed
of
everything
human
,
be
to
be
try
in
this
manner
.
<EOS>
Cruel
indeed
would
it
be
if
such
a
work
as
this
history
,
which
hath
employ
some
thousand
of
hour
in
the
composing
,
should
be
liable
to
be
condemn
,
because
some
particular
chapter
,
or
perhaps
chapter
,
may
be
obnoxious
to
very
just
and
sensible
objection
.
<EOS>
and
yet
nothing
be
more
common
than
the
most
rigorous
sentence
upon
book
support
by
such
objection
,
which
,
if
they
be
rightly
take
(
and
that
they
be
not
always
)
,
do
by
no
means
go
to
the
merit
of
the
whole
.
<EOS>
in
the
theatre
especially
,
a
single
expression
which
doth
not
coincide
with
the
taste
of
the
audience
,
or
with
any
individual
critic
of
that
audience
,
be
sure
to
be
hiss
;
and
one
scene
which
should
be
disapprove
would
hazard
the
whole
piece
.
<EOS>
to
write
within
such
severe
rule
as
these
be
as
impossible
as
to
live
up
to
some
splenetic
opinion
:
and
if
we
judge
accord
to
the
sentiment
of
some
critic
,
and
of
some
Christians
,
no
author
will
be
save
in
this
world
,
and
no
man
in
the
next
.
    
<EOS>
the
adventure
which
Sophia
meet
with
after
her
leave
Upton
.
 
<EOS>
Our
history
,
just
before
it
be
oblige
to
turn
about
and
travel
backwards
,
have
mention
the
departure
of
Sophia
and
her
maid
from
the
inn
;
we
shall
now
therefore
pursue
the
step
of
that
lovely
creature
,
and
leave
her
unworthy
lover
a
little
longer
to
bemoan
his
ill
-
luck
,
or
rather
his
ill
-
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
have
direct
her
guide
to
travel
through
bye
-
road
,
across
the
country
,
they
now
pass
the
severn
,
and
have
scarce
get
a
mile
from
the
inn
,
when
the
young
lady
,
look
behind
her
,
see
several
horse
come
after
on
full
speed
.
<EOS>
this
greatly
alarm
her
fear
,
and
she
call
to
the
guide
to
put
on
as
fast
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
He
immediately
obey
her
,
and
away
they
ride
a
full
gallop
.
<EOS>
but
the
faster
they
go
,
the
fast
be
they
follow
;
and
as
the
horse
behind
be
somewhat
swift
than
those
before
,
so
the
former
be
at
length
overtaken
.
<EOS>
a
happy
circumstance
for
poor
Sophia
;
whose
fear
,
join
to
her
fatigue
,
have
almost
overpower
her
spirit
;
but
she
be
now
instantly
relieve
by
a
female
voice
,
that
greet
her
in
the
soft
manner
,
and
with
the
utmost
civility
.
<EOS>
this
greeting
Sophia
,
as
soon
as
she
could
recover
her
breath
,
with
like
civility
,
and
with
the
high
satisfaction
to
herself
,
return
.
  
<EOS>
the
traveller
who
join
Sophia
,
and
who
have
give
her
such
terror
,
consist
,
like
her
own
company
,
of
two
female
and
a
guide
.
<EOS>
the
two
party
proceed
three
full
mile
together
before
any
one
offer
again
to
open
their
mouth
;
when
our
heroine
,
have
pretty
well
get
the
well
of
her
fear
(
but
yet
be
somewhat
surprize
that
the
other
still
continue
to
attend
her
,
as
she
pursue
no
great
road
,
and
have
already
pass
through
several
turning
)
,
accost
the
strange
lady
in
a
most
obliging
tone
,
and
say
,
"
She
be
very
happy
to
find
they
be
both
travel
the
same
way
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
other
,
who
,
like
a
ghost
,
only
want
to
be
speak
to
,
readily
answer
,
"
that
the
happiness
be
entirely
her
;
that
she
be
a
perfect
stranger
in
that
country
,
and
be
so
overjoyed
at
meet
a
companion
of
her
own
sex
,
that
she
have
perhaps
be
guilty
of
an
impertinence
,
which
require
great
apology
,
in
keep
pace
with
her
.
"
<EOS>
More
civility
pass
between
these
two
lady
;
for
Mrs
Honour
have
now
give
place
to
the
fine
habit
of
the
stranger
,
and
have
fall
into
the
rear
.
<EOS>
but
,
though
Sophia
have
great
curiosity
to
know
why
the
other
lady
continue
to
travel
on
through
the
same
bye
-
road
with
herself
,
nay
,
though
this
give
her
some
uneasiness
,
yet
fear
,
or
modesty
,
or
some
other
consideration
,
restrain
her
from
ask
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
the
strange
lady
now
labour
under
a
difficulty
which
appear
almost
below
the
dignity
of
history
to
mention
.
<EOS>
Her
bonnet
have
be
blow
from
her
head
not
less
than
five
time
within
the
last
mile
;
nor
could
she
come
at
any
ribbon
or
handkerchief
to
tie
it
under
her
chin
.
<EOS>
when
Sophia
be
inform
of
this
,
she
immediately
supply
her
with
a
handkerchief
for
this
purpose
;
which
while
she
be
pull
from
her
pocket
,
she
perhaps
too
much
neglect
the
management
of
her
horse
,
for
the
beast
,
now
unluckily
make
a
false
step
,
fall
upon
his
fore
-
leg
,
and
throw
his
fair
rider
from
his
back
.
  
<EOS>
though
Sophia
come
head
foremost
to
the
ground
,
she
happily
receive
not
the
least
damage
:
and
the
same
circumstance
which
have
perhaps
contribute
to
her
fall
now
preserve
her
from
confusion
;
for
the
lane
which
they
be
then
pass
be
narrow
,
and
very
much
overgrow
with
tree
,
so
that
the
moon
could
here
afford
very
little
light
,
and
be
moreover
,
at
present
,
so
obscure
in
a
cloud
,
that
it
be
almost
perfectly
dark
.
<EOS>
by
these
mean
the
young
lady
's
modesty
,
which
be
extremely
delicate
,
escape
as
free
from
injury
as
her
limb
,
and
she
be
once
more
reinstate
in
her
saddle
,
have
receive
no
other
harm
than
a
little
fright
by
her
fall
.
  
<EOS>
daylight
at
length
appear
in
its
full
lustre
;
and
now
the
two
lady
,
who
be
ride
over
a
common
side
by
side
,
look
stedfastly
at
each
other
,
at
the
same
moment
both
their
eye
become
fix
;
both
their
horse
stopt
,
and
,
both
speak
together
,
with
equal
joy
pronounce
,
the
one
<EOS>
the
name
of
Sophia
,
the
other
that
of
Harriet
.
  
<EOS>
this
unexpected
encounter
surprize
the
lady
much
more
than
I
believe
it
will
the
sagacious
reader
,
who
must
have
imagine
that
the
strange
lady
could
be
no
other
than
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
the
cousin
of
Miss
Western
,
whom
we
before
mention
to
have
sally
from
the
inn
a
few
minute
after
her
.
  
<EOS>
so
great
be
the
surprize
and
joy
which
these
two
cousin
conceive
at
this
meeting
(
for
they
have
formerly
be
most
intimate
acquaintance
and
friend
,
and
have
long
live
together
with
their
aunt
Western
)
,
that
it
be
impossible
to
recount
half
the
congratulation
which
pass
between
them
,
before
either
ask
a
very
natural
question
of
the
other
,
<EOS>
namely
,
whither
she
be
go
?
  
<EOS>
this
at
last
,
however
,
come
first
from
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
;
but
,
easy
and
natural
as
the
question
may
seem
,
Sophia
find
it
difficult
to
give
it
a
very
ready
and
certain
answer
.
<EOS>
She
beg
her
cousin
therefore
to
suspend
all
curiosity
till
they
arrive
at
some
inn
,
"
which
I
suppose
,
"
say
she
,
"
can
hardly
be
far
distant
;
and
,
believe
me
,
Harriet
,
I
suspend
as
much
curiosity
on
my
side
;
<EOS>
for
,
indeed
,
I
believe
our
astonishment
be
pretty
equal
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
conversation
which
pass
between
these
lady
on
the
road
be
,
I
apprehend
,
little
worth
relate
;
and
less
certainly
be
that
between
the
two
wait
-
woman
;
for
they
likewise
begin
to
pay
their
compliment
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
guide
,
they
be
debar
from
the
pleasure
of
discourse
,
the
one
be
place
in
the
van
,
and
the
other
oblige
to
bring
up
the
rear
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
posture
they
travel
many
hour
,
till
they
come
into
a
wide
and
well
-
beat
road
,
which
,
as
they
turn
to
the
right
,
soon
bring
them
to
a
very
fair
promising
inn
,
where
they
all
alight
:
but
so
fatigued
be
Sophia
,
that
as
she
have
sit
her
horse
during
the
last
five
or
six
mile
with
great
difficulty
,
so
be
she
now
incapable
of
dismount
from
him
without
assistance
.
<EOS>
this
the
landlord
,
who
have
hold
of
her
horse
,
presently
perceive
,
offer
to
lift
her
in
his
arm
from
her
saddle
;
and
she
too
readily
accept
the
tender
of
his
service
.
<EOS>
indeed
fortune
seem
to
have
resolve
to
put
Sophia
to
the
blush
that
day
,
and
the
second
malicious
attempt
succeed
better
than
the
first
;
for
my
landlord
have
no
sooner
receive
the
young
lady
in
his
arm
,
than
his
foot
,
which
the
gout
have
lately
very
severely
handle
,
give
way
,
and
down
he
tumble
;
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
with
no
less
dexterity
than
gallantry
,
contrive
to
throw
himself
under
his
charming
burden
,
so
that
he
alone
receive
any
bruise
from
the
fall
;
for
the
great
injury
which
happen
to
Sophia
be
a
violent
shock
give
to
her
modesty
by
an
immoderate
grin
,
which
,
at
her
rise
from
the
ground
,
she
observe
in
the
countenance
of
most
of
the
bye
-
stander
.
<EOS>
this
make
her
suspect
what
have
really
happen
,
and
what
we
shall
not
here
relate
for
the
indulgence
of
those
reader
who
be
capable
of
laugh
at
the
offence
give
to
a
young
lady
's
delicacy
.
<EOS>
accident
of
this
kind
we
have
never
regard
in
a
comical
light
;
nor
will
we
scruple
to
say
that
he
must
have
a
very
inadequate
idea
of
the
modesty
of
a
beautiful
young
woman
,
who
would
wish
to
sacrifice
it
to
so
paltry
a
satisfaction
as
can
arise
from
laughter
.
  
<EOS>
this
fright
and
shock
,
join
to
the
violent
fatigue
which
both
her
mind
and
body
have
undergo
,
almost
overcome
the
excellent
constitution
of
Sophia
,
and
she
have
scarce
strength
sufficient
to
totter
into
the
inn
,
lean
on
the
arm
of
her
maid
.
<EOS>
here
she
be
no
sooner
seated
than
she
call
for
a
glass
of
water
;
but
Mrs
Honour
,
very
judiciously
,
in
my
opinion
,
change
it
into
a
glass
of
wine
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
hear
from
Mrs
Honour
that
Sophia
have
not
be
in
bed
during
the
two
last
night
,
and
observe
her
to
look
very
pale
and
wan
with
her
fatigue
,
earnestly
entreat
her
to
refresh
herself
with
some
sleep
.
<EOS>
She
be
yet
a
stranger
to
her
history
,
or
her
apprehension
;
but
,
have
she
know
both
,
she
would
have
give
the
same
advice
;
for
rest
be
visibly
necessary
for
her
;
and
their
long
journey
through
bye
-
road
so
entirely
remove
all
danger
of
pursuit
,
that
she
be
herself
perfectly
easy
on
that
account
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
be
easily
prevail
on
to
follow
the
counsel
of
her
friend
,
which
be
heartily
second
by
her
maid
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
likewise
offer
to
bear
her
cousin
company
,
which
Sophia
,
with
much
complacence
,
accept
.
  
<EOS>
the
mistress
be
no
sooner
in
bed
than
the
maid
prepare
to
follow
her
example
.
<EOS>
She
begin
to
make
many
apology
to
her
sister
Abigail
for
leave
her
alone
in
so
horrid
a
place
as
an
inn
;
but
the
other
stopt
her
short
,
be
as
well
inclined
to
a
nap
as
herself
,
and
desire
the
honour
of
be
her
bedfellow
.
<EOS>
Sophia
's
maid
agree
to
give
her
a
share
of
her
bed
,
but
put
in
her
claim
to
all
the
honour
.
<EOS>
so
,
after
many
courtsie
and
compliment
,
to
bed
together
go
the
waiting
-
woman
,
as
their
mistress
have
do
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
usual
with
my
landlord
<EOS>
(
as
indeed
it
be
with
the
whole
fraternity
)
to
enquire
particularly
of
all
coachman
,
footman
,
postboy
,
and
other
,
into
the
name
of
all
his
guest
;
what
their
estate
be
,
and
where
it
lie
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
therefore
be
wonder
at
that
the
many
particular
circumstance
which
attend
our
traveller
,
and
especially
their
retire
all
to
sleep
at
so
extraordinary
and
unusual
an
hour
as
ten
in
the
morning
,
should
excite
his
curiosity
.
<EOS>
as
soon
,
therefore
,
as
the
guide
enter
the
kitchen
,
he
begin
to
examine
who
the
lady
be
,
and
whence
they
come
;
but
the
guide
,
though
they
faithfully
relate
all
they
know
,
give
him
very
little
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
they
rather
enflame
his
curiosity
than
extinguish
it
.
  
<EOS>
this
landlord
have
the
character
,
among
all
his
neighbour
,
of
be
a
very
sagacious
fellow
.
<EOS>
He
be
think
to
see
farth
and
deep
into
thing
than
any
man
in
the
parish
,
the
parson
himself
not
except
.
<EOS>
perhaps
his
look
have
contribute
not
a
little
to
procure
him
this
reputation
;
for
there
be
in
this
something
wonderfully
wise
and
significant
,
especially
when
he
have
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
;
which
,
indeed
,
he
seldom
be
without
.
<EOS>
His
behaviour
,
likewise
,
greatly
assist
in
promote
the
opinion
of
his
wisdom
.
<EOS>
in
his
deportment
he
be
solemn
,
if
not
sullen
;
and
when
he
speak
,
which
be
seldom
,
he
always
deliver
himself
in
a
slow
voice
;
and
,
though
his
sentence
be
short
,
they
be
still
interrupt
with
many
hum
and
ha
's
,
ay
ays
,
and
other
expletive
:
so
that
,
though
he
accompany
his
word
with
certain
explanatory
gesture
,
such
as
shake
or
nod
the
head
,
or
point
with
his
fore
-
finger
,
he
generally
leave
his
hearer
to
understand
more
than
he
express
;
<EOS>
nay
,
he
commonly
give
them
a
hint
that
he
know
much
more
than
he
think
proper
to
disclose
.
<EOS>
this
last
circumstance
alone
may
,
indeed
,
very
well
account
for
his
character
of
wisdom
;
since
man
be
strangely
inclined
to
worship
what
they
do
not
understand
.
<EOS>
a
grand
secret
,
upon
which
several
imposer
on
mankind
have
totally
rely
for
the
success
of
their
fraud
.
  
<EOS>
this
polite
person
,
now
take
his
wife
aside
,
ask
her
"
what
she
think
of
the
lady
lately
arrive
?
"
<EOS>
"
think
of
them
?
<EOS>
"
say
the
wife
,
"
why
,
what
should
I
think
of
them
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
"
answer
he
,
"
what
I
think
.
<EOS>
the
guide
tell
strange
story
.
<EOS>
one
pretend
to
be
come
from
Gloucester
,
and
the
other
from
Upton
;
and
neither
of
them
,
for
what
I
can
find
,
can
tell
whither
they
be
go
.
<EOS>
but
what
people
ever
travel
across
the
country
from
Upton
hither
,
especially
to
London
?
<EOS>
and
one
of
the
maid
-
servant
,
before
she
alight
from
her
horse
,
ask
if
this
be
not
the
London
road
?
<EOS>
now
I
have
put
all
these
circumstance
together
,
and
whom
do
you
think
I
have
find
them
out
to
be
?
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
answer
she
,
"
you
know
I
never
pretend
to
guess
at
your
discovery
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
good
girl
,
"
reply
he
,
chuck
her
under
the
chin
;
"
I
must
own
you
have
always
submit
to
my
knowledge
of
these
matter
.
<EOS>
why
,
then
,
depend
upon
it
;
mind
what
I
say
 
depend
upon
it
,
they
be
certainly
some
of
the
rebel
lady
,
who
,
they
say
,
travel
with
the
young
Chevalier
;
and
have
take
a
roundabout
way
to
escape
the
duke
's
army
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Husband
,
"
quoth
the
wife
<EOS>
,
"
you
have
certainly
hit
it
;
for
one
of
them
be
dress
as
fine
as
any
princess
;
and
,
to
be
sure
,
she
look
for
all
the
world
like
one
.
 
<EOS>
but
yet
,
when
I
consider
one
thing
"
 
"
when
you
consider
,
"
cry
<EOS>
the
landlord
contemptuously
"
come
,
pray
let
's
hear
what
you
consider
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
it
be
,
"
answer
the
wife
,
"
that
she
be
too
humble
to
be
any
very
great
lady
:
for
,
while
our
Betty
be
warm
the
bed
,
she
call
her
nothing
but
child
,
and
my
dear
,
and
sweetheart
;
and
,
when
Betty
offer
to
pull
off
her
shoe
and
stocking
,
she
would
not
suffer
her
,
say
,
she
would
not
give
her
the
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
pugh
!
"
answer
the
husband
,
"
that
be
nothing
.
<EOS>
dost
think
,
because
you
have
see
some
great
lady
rude
and
uncivil
to
person
below
them
,
that
none
of
them
know
how
to
behave
themselves
when
they
come
before
their
inferior
?
<EOS>
I
think
I
know
people
of
fashion
when
I
see
them
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
do
.
<EOS>
do
not
she
call
for
a
glass
of
water
when
she
come
in
?
<EOS>
another
sort
of
woman
would
have
call
for
a
dram
;
you
know
they
would
.
<EOS>
if
she
be
not
a
woman
of
very
great
quality
,
sell
me
for
a
fool
;
and
,
I
believe
,
those
who
buy
me
will
have
a
bad
bargain
.
<EOS>
now
,
would
a
woman
of
her
quality
travel
without
a
footman
,
unless
upon
some
such
extraordinary
occasion
?
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
to
be
sure
,
husband
,
"
cry
she
,
"
you
know
these
matter
better
than
I
,
or
most
folk
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
do
know
something
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
,
"
answer
the
wife
,
"
the
poor
little
heart
look
so
piteous
,
<EOS>
when
she
sit
down
in
the
chair
,
I
protest
I
could
not
help
have
a
compassion
for
her
almost
as
much
as
if

<EOS>
if

she

I

she

she

<EOS>
"
Pooh
!

answer
the
husband

<EOS>
"
but
,
as
to
what
be
to
be
do
,
it
be
not
so
easy
a
matter
to
determine
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
before
she
go
away
,
we
shall
have
the
news
of
a
battle
;
for
,
if
the
Chevalier
should
get
the
well

she
may
gain
us
interest
at
court

and
make
our
fortune
without
betray
her

<EOS>
"
why

that
be
true

the
wife

and
I
heartily
hope
she
will
have
it
in
her
power

<EOS>
certainly
she
be
a
sweet
good
lady

it
would
go
horribly
against
me
to
have
her

to
any
harm

<EOS>
"
Pooh
!

the
landlord

always
so
tender

hearted

<EOS>
why
,
you
would
not
harbour
rebel
,
would
you
?
"
<EOS>
"
no
,
certainly
,
"
answer
the
wife
;
"
and
as
for
betray
her
,
come
what
will
on't
,
nobody
can
blame
us
.
<EOS>
It
be
what
anybody
would
do
in
our

"
  
<EOS>
while
our
politic
landlord

who

we
see
,
undeservedly
the
reputation
of
great
wisdom
among
his
neighbour

be
engage
in
debate
this
matter
with
himself
(
for
he
pay
little
attention
to
the
opinion
of
his

<EOS>
,
news
arrive
that
the
rebel
have
give
the

the
slip

and
have
get
a
day

march
towards
London

soon
after

famous
Jacobite

who
,
with
great
joy
in

determine
the
opinion
of

and
he
resolve
to
make
his
court
to
the
young

<EOS>
a
very
short
chapter
,
in
which
however
be
a
sun
,
a
moon
,
a
star
,
and
an
angel
.
 
<EOS>
the
sun
(
for
he
keep
very
good
hour
at
this
time
of
the
year
)
have
be
some
time
retire
to
rest
when
Sophia
arise
greatly
refresh
by
her
sleep
;
which
,
short
as
it
be
,
nothing
but
her
extreme
fatigue
could
have
occasion
;
for
,
though
she
have
tell
her
maid
,
and
perhaps
herself
too
,
that
she
be
perfectly
easy
when
she
leave
Upton
,
yet
it
be
certain
<EOS>
her
mind
be
a
little
affected
with
that
malady
which
be
attend
with
all
the
restless
symptom
of
a
fever
,
and
be
perhaps
the
very
distemper
which
physician
mean
(
if
they
mean
anything
)
by
the
fever
on
the
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
likewise
leave
her
bed
at
the
same
time
;
and
,
have
summon
her
maid
,
immediately
dress
herself
.
<EOS>
She
be
really
a
very
pretty
woman
,
and
,
have
she
be
in
any
other
company
but
that
of
Sophia
,
may
have
be
think
beautiful
;
but
when
Mrs
Honour
of
her
own
accord
attend
(
for
her
mistress
would
not
suffer
her
to
be
wake
)
,
and
have
equip
our
heroine
,
the
charm
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
who
have
perform
the
office
of
the
morning
-
star
,
and
have
precede
great
glory
,
share
the
fate
of
that
star
,
and
be
totally
eclipse
the
moment
those
glory
shine
forth
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
Sophia
never
look
more
beautiful
than
she
do
at
this
instant
.
<EOS>
We
ought
not
,
therefore
,
to
condemn
the
maid
of
the
inn
for
her
hyperbole
,
who
,
when
she
descend
,
after
have
light
the
fire
,
declare
,
and
ratify
it
with
an
oath
,
that
if
ever
there
be
an
angel
upon
earth
,
she
be
now
above

stair
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
have
acquaint
her
cousin
with
her
design
to
go
to
London
;
and
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
have
agree
to
accompany
her
;
for
the
arrival
of
her
husband
at
Upton
have
put
an
end
to
her
design
of
go
to
Bath
,
or
to
her
aunt
Western
.
<EOS>
They
have
therefore
no
sooner
finish
their
tea
than
Sophia
propose
to
set
out
,
the
moon
then
shine
extremely
bright
,
and
as
for
the
frost
she
defy
it
;
nor
have
she
any
of
those
apprehension
which
many
young
lady
would
have
feel
at
travel
by
night
;
for
she
have
,
as
we
have
before
observe
,
some
little
degree
of
natural
courage
;
and
this
,
her
present
sensation
,
which
border
somewhat
on
despair
,
greatly
encrease
.
<EOS>
besides
,
as
she
have
already
travel
twice
with
safety
by
the
light
of
the
moon
,
she
be
the
well
emboldened
to
trust
to
it
a
third
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
disposition
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
be
more
timorous
;
for
,
though
the
great
terror
have
conquer
the
less
,
and
the
presence
of
her
husband
have
drive
her
away
at
so
unseasonable
an
hour
from
Upton
,
yet
,
be
now
arrive
at
a
place
where
she
think
herself
safe
from
his
pursuit
,
these
less
terror
of
I
know
not
what
operate
so
strongly
,
that
she
earnestly
entreat
her
cousin
to
stay
till
the
next
morning
,
and
not
expose
herself
to
the
danger
of
travel
by
night
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
,
who
be
yield
to
an
excess
,
when
she
could
neither
laugh
nor
reason
her
cousin
out
of
these
apprehension
,
at
last
give
way
to
them
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
indeed
,
have
she
know
of
her
father
's
arrival
at
Upton
,
it
may
have
be
more
difficult
to
have
persuade
her
;
for
as
to
Jones
,
she
have
,
I
be
afraid
,
no
great
horror
at
the
thought
of
be
overtake
by
him
;
nay
,
to
confess
the
truth
,
I
believe
she
rather
wish
than
fear
it
;
though
I
may
honestly
enough
have
conceal
this
wish
from
the
reader
,
as
it
be
one
of
those
secret
spontaneous
emotion
of
the
soul
to
which
the
reason
be
often
a
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
when
our
young
lady
have
determine
to
remain
all
that
evening
in
their
inn
they
be
attend
by
the
landlady
,
who
desire
to
know
what
their
ladyship
would
be
pleased
to
eat
.
<EOS>
such
charm
be
there
in
the
voice
,
in
the
manner
,
and
in
the
affable
deportment
of
Sophia
,
that
she
ravish
the
landlady
to
the
high
degree
;
and
that
good
woman
,
conclude
that
she
have
attend
Jenny
Cameron
,
become
in
a
moment
a
stanch
Jacobite
,
and
wish
heartily
well
to
the
young
Pretender
's
cause
,
from
the
great
sweetness
and
affability
with
which
she
have
be
treat
by
his
suppose
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
cousin
begin
now
to
impart
to
each
other
their
reciprocal
curiosity
to
know
what
extraordinary
accident
on
both
side
occasion
this
so
strange
and
unexpected
meeting
.
<EOS>
at
last
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
have
obtain
of
Sophia
a
promise
of
communicate
likewise
in
her
turn
,
begin
to
relate
what
the
reader
,
if
he
be
desirous
to
know
her
history
,
may
read
in
the
ensue
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
the
history
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
after
a
silence
of
a
few
moment
,
fetch
a
deep
sigh
,
thus
begin
:
  
"
It
be
natural
to
the
unhappy
to
feel
a
secret
concern
in
recollect
those
period
of
their
life
which
have
be
most
delightful
to
them
.
<EOS>
the
remembrance
of
past
pleasure
affect
us
with
a
kind
of
tender
grief
,
like
what
we
suffer
for
depart
friend
;
and
the
idea
of
both
may
be
say
to
haunt
our
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
"
for
this
reason
,
I
never
reflect
without
sorrow
on
those
day
(
the
happiest
far
of
my
life
)
which
we
spend
together
when
both
be
under
the
care
of
my
aunt
western
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
why
be
Miss
Graveairs
and
Miss
Giddy
<EOS>
no
more
?
<EOS>
You
remember
,
I
be
sure
,
when
we
know
each
other
by
no
other
name
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
you
give
the
latter
appellation
with
too
much
cause
.
<EOS>
I
have
since
experience
how
much
I
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
You
,
my
Sophia
,
be
always
my
superior
in
everything
,
and
I
heartily
hope
you
will
be
so
in
your
fortune
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
the
wise
and
matronly
advice
you
once
give
me
,
when
I
lament
be
disappoint
of
a
ball
,
though
you
could
not
be
then
fourteen
year
old
.
 
<EOS>
o
my
Sophy
,
how
blest
must
have
be
my
situation
,
when
I
could
think
such
a
disappointment
a
misfortune
;
and
when
indeed
it
be
the
great
I
have
ever
know
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
yet
,
my
dear
Harriet
,
"
answer
Sophia
,
"
it
be
then
a
serious
matter
with
you
.
<EOS>
comfort
yourself
therefore
with
thinking
,
that
whatever
you
now
lament
may
hereafter
appear
as
trifling
and
contemptible
as
a
ball
would
at
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
alas
,
my
Sophia
,
"
reply
the
other
lady
,
"
you
yourself
will
think
otherwise
of
my
present
situation
;
for
greatly
must
that
tender
heart
be
alter
if
my
misfortune
do
not
draw
many
a
sigh
,
nay
,
many
a
tear
,
from
you
.
<EOS>
the
knowledge
of
this
should
perhaps
deter
me
from
relate
what
I
be
convinced
will
so
much
affect
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
stopt
,
till
,
at
the
repeat
entreaty
of
Sophia
,
she
thus
proceed
:
  
"
though
you
must
have
hear
much
of
my
marriage
;
yet
,
as
matter
may
probably
have
be
misrepresent
,
I
will
set
out
from
the
very
commencement
of
my
unfortunate
acquaintance
with
my
present
husband
;
which
be
at
Bath
,
soon
after
you
leave
my
aunt
,
and
return
home
to
your
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
among
the
gay
young
fellow
who
be
at
this
season
at
Bath
,
Mr
Fitzpatrick
be
one
.
<EOS>
He
be
handsome
,
degage
,
extremely
gallant
,
and
in
his
dress
exceed
most
other
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
my
dear
,
if
you
be
unluckily
to
see
him
now
,
I
could
describe
him
no
better
than
by
tell
you
he
be
the
very
reverse
of
everything
which
he
be
:
for
he
hath
rusticate
himself
so
long
,
that
he
be
become
an
absolute
wild
Irishman
.
<EOS>
but
to
proceed
in
my
story
:
the
qualification
which
he
then
possess
so
well
recommend
him
,
that
,
though
the
people
of
quality
at
that
time
live
separate
from
the
rest
of
the
company
,
and
exclude
them
from
all
their
party
,
Mr
Fitzpatrick
find
mean
to
gain
admittance
.
<EOS>
It
be
perhaps
no
easy
matter
to
avoid
him
;
for
he
require
very
little
or
no
invitation
;
and
as
,
be
handsome
and
genteel
,
he
find
it
no
very
difficult
matter
to
ingratiate
himself
with
the
lady
,
so
,
he
have
frequently
draw
his
sword
<EOS>
,
the
man
do
not
care
publickly
to
affront
him
.
<EOS>
have
it
not
be
for
some
such
reason
,
I
believe
he
would
have
be
soon
expel
by
his
own
sex
;
for
surely
he
have
no
strict
title
to
be
prefer
to
the
english
gentry
;
nor
do
they
seem
inclined
to
show
him
any
extraordinary
favour
.
<EOS>
They
all
abuse
him
behind
his
back
,
which
may
probably
proceed
from
envy
;
for
by
the
woman
he
be
well
receive
,
and
very
particularly
distinguish
by
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
aunt
,
though
no
person
of
quality
herself
,
as
she
have
always
live
about
the
court
,
be
enrol
in
that
party
;
for
,
by
whatever
mean
you
get
into
the
polite
circle
,
when
you
be
once
there
,
it
be
sufficient
merit
for
you
that
you
be
there
.
<EOS>
this
observation
,
young
as
you
be
,
you
could
scarce
avoid
make
from
my
aunt
,
who
be
free
,
or
reserve
,
with
all
people
,
just
as
they
have
more
or
less
of
this
merit
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
this
merit
,
I
believe
,
it
be
,
which
principally
recommend
Mr
Fitzpatrick
to
her
favour
.
<EOS>
in
which
he
so
well
succeed
,
that
he
be
always
one
of
her
private
party
.
<EOS>
nor
be
he
backward
in
return
such
distinction
;
for
he
soon
grow
so
very
particular
in
his
behaviour
to
her
,
that
the
scandal
club
first
begin
to
take
notice
of
it
,
and
the
better
-
dispose
person
make
a
match
between
them
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
confess
,
I
make
no
doubt
but
that
his
design
be
strictly
honourable
,
as
the
phrase
be
;
that
is
,
to
rob
a
lady
of
her
fortune
by
way
of
marriage
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
be
,
I
conceive
,
neither
young
enough
nor
handsome
enough
to
attract
much
wicked
inclination
;
but
she
have
matrimonial
charm
in
great
abundance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
the
more
confirmed
in
this
opinion
from
the
extraordinary
respect
which
he
show
to
myself
from
the
first
moment
of
our
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
this
I
understand
as
an
attempt
to
lessen
,
if
possible
,
that
disinclination
which
my
interest
may
be
suppose
to
give
me
towards
the
match
;
and
I
know
not
but
in
some
measure
it
have
that
effect
;
for
,
as
I
be
well
contented
with
my
own
fortune
,
and
of
all
people
the
least
a
slave
to
interested
view
,
so
I
could
not
be
violently
the
enemy
of
a
man
with
whose
behaviour
to
me
<EOS>
I
be
greatly
pleased
;
and
the
more
so
,
as
I
be
the
only
object
of
such
respect
;
for
he
behave
at
the
same
time
to
many
woman
of
quality
without
any
respect
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
agreeable
as
this
be
to
me
,
he
soon
change
it
into
another
kind
of
behaviour
,
which
be
perhaps
more
so
.
<EOS>
He
now
put
on
much
softness
and
tenderness
,
and
languish
and
sigh
abundantly
.
<EOS>
at
time
,
indeed
,
whether
from
art
or
nature
I
will
not
determine
,
he
give
his
usual
loose
to
gaiety
and
mirth
;
but
this
be
always
in
general
company
,
and
with
other
woman
;
for
even
in
a
country
-
dance
,
when
he
be
not
my
partner
,
he
become
grave

and
put
on
the
soft
look
imaginable
the
moment
he
approach
me

<EOS>
indeed
he
be
in
all
thing
so
very
particular
towards
me
,
that
I
must
have
be
blind
not
to
have
discover
it

which

her
cousin
;

man
,
who
in
all
other
instance
want
common
sense
,
be
very
Machiavels
in
the
art
of
loving
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
do
not
know
an
instance
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
scandal
now
begin
to
be
as
busy
with
me
as
it
have
before
be
with
my
aunt
;
and
some
good
lady
do
not
scruple
to
affirm
that
Mr
Fitzpatrick
have
an
intrigue
with
us
both
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
what
may
seem
astonishing
,
my
aunt
never
see
,
nor
in
the
least
seem
to
suspect
,
that
which
be
visible
enough
,
I
believe
,
from
both
our
behaviour
.
<EOS>
one
would
indeed
think
that
love
quite
put
out
the
eye
of
an
old
woman
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
they
so
greedily
swallow
the
address
which
be
make
to
them
,
that
,
like
an
outrageous
glutton
,
they
be
not
at
leisure
to
observe
what
pass
amongst
other
at
the
same
table
.
<EOS>
this
I
have
observe
in
more
case
than
my
own
;
and
this
be
so
strongly
verify
by
my
aunt
,
that
,
though
she
often
find
us
together
at
her
return
from
the
pump
,
the
least
canting
word
of
his
,
pretend
impatience
at
her
absence
,
effectually
smother
all
suspicion
.
<EOS>
one
artifice
succeed
with
her
to
admiration
.
<EOS>
this
be
his
treat
me
like
a
little
child
,
and
never
call
me
by
any
other
name
in
her
presence
but
that
of
pretty
miss
.
<EOS>
this
indeed
do
him
some
disservice
with
your
humble
servant
;
but
I
soon
see
through
it
,
especially
as
in
her
absence
he
behave
to
me
,
as
I
have
say
,
in
a
different
manner
.
<EOS>
however
,
if
I
be
not
greatly
disoblige
by
a
conduct
of
which
I
have
discover
the
design
,
I
smart
very
severely
for
it
;
for
my
aunt
really
conceive
me
to
be
what
her
lover
(
as
she
think
him
)
call
me
,
and
treat
me
in
all
respect
as
a
perfect
infant
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
I
wonder
she
have
not
insist
on
my
again
wear
lead
-
string
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
last
,
my
lover
(
for
so
he
be
)
think
proper
,
in
a
most
solemn
manner
,
to
disclose
a
secret
which
I
have
know
long
before
.
<EOS>
He
now
place
all
the
love
which
he
have
pretend
to
my
aunt
to
my
account
.
<EOS>
He
lament
,
in
very
pathetic
term
,
the
encouragement
she
have
give
him
,
and
make
a
high
merit
of
the
tedious
hour
in
which
he
have
undergo
her
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
what
shall
I
tell
you
,
my
dear
Sophia
?
 
<EOS>
then
I
will
confess
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
be
pleased
with
my
man
.
<EOS>
I
be
pleased
with
my
conquest
.
<EOS>
to
rival
my
aunt
delight
me
;
to
rival
so
many
other
woman
charm
me
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
be
afraid
I
do
not
behave
as
I
should
do
,
even
upon
the
very
first
declaration
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
do
not
almost
give
him
positive
encouragement
before
we
part
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
Bath
now
talk
loudly
 
I
may
almost
say
,
roar
against
me
.
<EOS>
several
young
woman
affect
to
shun
my
acquaintance
,
not
so
much
,
perhaps
,
from
any
real
suspicion
,
as
from
a
desire
of
banish
me
from
a
company
in
which
I
too
much
engross
their
favourite
man
.
<EOS>
and
here
I
can
not
omit
express
my
gratitude
to
the
kindness
intend
me
by
Mr
Nash
,
who
take
me
one
day
aside
,
and
give
me
advice
,
which
if
I
have
follow
,
I
have
be
a
happy
woman
.
<EOS>
"
child
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
be
sorry
to
see
the
familiarity
which
subsist
between
you
and
a
fellow
who
be
altogether
unworthy
of
you
,
and
I
be
afraid
will
prove
your
ruin
.
<EOS>
as
for
your
old
stinking
aunt
,
if
it
be
to
be
no
injury
to
you
and
my
pretty
Sophy
Western
<EOS>
(
I
assure
you
I
repeat
his
word
)
,
I
should
be
heartily
glad
that
the
fellow
be
in
possession
of
all
that
belong
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
never
advise
old
woman
:
for
,
<EOS>
if
they
take
it
into
their
head
to
go
to
the
devil
,
it
be
no
more
possible
than
worth
while
to
keep
them
from
him
.
<EOS>
innocence
and
youth
and
beauty
be
worthy
a
well
fate
,
and
I
would
save
them
from
his
clutch
.
<EOS>
let
me
advise
you
therefore
,
dear
child
,
never
suffer
this
fellow
to
be
particular
with
you
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
many
more
thing
he
say
to
me
,
which
I
have
now
forget
,
and
indeed
I
attend
very
little
to
them
at
the
time
;
for
inclination
contradict
all
he
say
;
and
,
besides
,
I
could
not
be
persuade
that
woman
of
quality
would
condescend
to
familiarity
with
such
a
person
as
he
describe
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
be
afraid
,
my
dear
,
I
shall
tire
you
with
a
detail
of
so
many
minute
circumstance
.
<EOS>
to
be
concise
,
therefore
,
imagine
me
married
;
imagine
me
with
my
husband
,
at
the
foot
of
my
aunt
;
and
then
imagine
the
maddest
woman
in
Bedlam
,
in
a
raving
fit
,
and
your
imagination
will
suggest
to
you
no
more
than
what
really
happen
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
very
next
day
my
aunt
leave
the
place
,
partly
to
avoid
see
Mr
Fitzpatrick
or
myself
,
and
as
much
perhaps
to
avoid
see
any
one
else
;
for
,
though
I
be
tell
she
hath
since
deny
everything
stoutly
<EOS>
,
I
believe
she
be
then
a
little
confounded
at
her
disappointment
.
<EOS>
since
that
time
,
I
have
write
to
her
many
letter
,
but
never
could
obtain
an
answer
,
which
I
must
own
sit
somewhat
the
heavy
,
as
she
herself
be
,
though
undesignedly
,
the
occasion
of
all
my
suffering
:
<EOS>
for
,
have
it
not
be
under
the
colour
of
pay
his
address
to
her
,
Mr
Fitzpatrick
would
never
have
find
sufficient
opportunity
to
have
engage
my
heart
,
which
,
in
other
circumstance
,
I
still
flatter
myself
would
not
have
be
an
easy
conquest
to
such
a
person
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
believe
I
should
not
have
err
so
grossly
in
my
choice
if
I
have
rely
on
my
own
judgment
;
but
I
trust
totally
to
the
opinion
of
other
,
and
very
foolishly
take
the
merit
of
a
man
for
grant
whom
I
see
so
universally
well
receive
by
the
woman
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
reason
,
my
dear
,
that
we
,
who
have
understanding
equal
to
the
wise
and
great
of
the
other
sex
,
so
often
make
choice
of
the
silly
fellow
for
companion
and
favourite
?
<EOS>
It
raise
my
indignation
to
the
high
pitch
to
reflect
on
the
number
of
woman
of
sense
who
have
be
undo
by
fool
.
<EOS>
"
here
she
pause
a
moment
;
but
,
Sophia
make
no
answer
,
she
proceed
as
in
the
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
the
history
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
be
continue
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
remain
at
Bath
no
longer
than
a
fortnight
after
our
wedding
;
for
as
to
any
reconciliation
with
my
aunt
,
there
be
no
hope
;
and
of
my
fortune
<EOS>
not
one
farthing
could
be
touch
till
I
be
of
age
,
of
which
I
now
want
more
than
two
year
.
<EOS>
My
husband
therefore
be
resolve
to
set
out
for
Ireland
;
against
which
I
remonstrate
very
earnestly
,
and
insist
on
a
promise
which
he
have
make
me
before
our
marriage
that
I
should
never
take
this
journey
against
my
consent
;
and
indeed
I
never
intend
to
consent
to
it
;
nor
will
anybody
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
blame
me
for
that
resolution
;
but
this
,
however
,
I
never
mention
to
my
husband
,
and
petition
only
for
the
reprieve
of
a
month
;
but
he
have
fix
the
day
,
and
to
that
day
he
obstinately
adhere
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
evening
before
our
departure
,
as
we
be
dispute
this
point
with
great
eagerness
on
both
side
,
he
start
suddenly
from
his
chair
,
and
leave
me
abruptly
,
say
he
be
go
to
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
be
hardly
out
of
the
house
when
I
see
a
paper
lie
on
the
floor
,
which
,
I
suppose
,
he
have
carelessly
pull
from
his
pocket
,
together
with
his
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
this
paper
I
take
up
,
and
,
find
it
to
be
a
letter
,
I
make
no
scruple
to
open
and
read
it
;
and
indeed
I
read
it
so
often
that
I
can
repeat
it
to
you
almost
word
for
word
.
<EOS>
this
then
be
the
letter
:
  
"
to
Mr
Brian
Fitzpatrick
.
    
<EOS>
"
SIR
,
    
"
your

,
and
be
surprize
you
should
use
me
in
this
manner
,
  
as
have
never
see
any
of
your
cash
,
unless
for
one
linsey
-
woolsey
  
coat
,
and
your
bill
now
be
upwards
of
L150

<EOS>
consider
,
sir
,
how
often
  
you
have
fob
me
off
with
your
be
shortly
to
be
married
to
this
  
lady
and
t'other
lady

but
I
can
neither
live
on
hope
or
promise
,
  
nor
will
my

any
such
in
payment
.
<EOS>
You
tell
me
you
  
be
secure
of
have
either
the
aunt
or
the
niece
,
and
that
you
  
may
have
marry
the
aunt
before
this
,
whose
jointure
you
say
be
  
immense
,
but
that
you
prefer
the
niece
on
account
of
her
ready
  
money

<EOS>
Pray
,
sir
,
take
a
fool
's
advice
for
once
,
and
marry
the
first
  
you
can
get
.
<EOS>
You
will
pardon
my
offer
my
advice
,
as
you
know
I
  
sincerely
wish
you
well

<EOS>
Shall
draw
on
you

in
favour
  
of
Messieurs
John

this
be
the
letter
,
word
for
word
.
<EOS>
guess
,
my
dear
girl
 
guess
how
this
letter
affect
me
.
<EOS>
You
prefer
the
niece
on
account
of
her
ready
money
!
<EOS>
if
every
one
of
these
word
have
be
a
dagger
,
I
could
with
pleasure
have
stab
them
into
his
heart
;
but
I
will
not
recount
my
frantic
behaviour
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
have
pretty
well
spend
my
tear
before
his
return
home
;
but
sufficient
remain
of
them
appear
in
my
swollen
eye
.
<EOS>
He
throw
himself
sullenly
into
his
chair
,
and
for
a
long
time
we
be
both
silent
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
in
a
haughty
tone
,
he
say
,
"
I
hope
,
madam
,
your
servant
have
pack
up
all
your
thing
;
for
the
coach
will
be
ready
by
six
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
My
patience
be
totally
subdue
by
this
provocation
,
and
I
answer
,
"
no
,
sir
,
there
be
a
letter
still
remain
unpacked
;
"
and
then
throw
it
on
the
table
I
fall
to
upbraid
him
with
the
most
bitter
language
I
could
invent
.
  
<EOS>
"
whether
guilt
,
or
shame
,
or
prudence
,
restrain
him
I
can
not
say
;
but
,
though
he
be
the
most
passionate
of
man
,
he
exert
no
rage
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
endeavour
,
on
the
contrary
,
to
pacify
me
by
the
most
gentle
mean
.
<EOS>
He
swear
the
phrase
in
the
letter
to
which
I
principally
object
be
not
his
,
nor
have
he
ever
write
any
such
.
<EOS>
He
own
,
indeed
,
the
have
mention
his
marriage
,
and
that
preference
which
he
have
give
to
myself
,
but
deny
with
many
oath
the
have
mention
any
such
matter
at
all
on
account
of
the
strait
he
be
in
for
money
,
arise
,
he
say
,
from
his
have
too
long
neglect
his
estate
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
and
this
,
he
say
,
which
he
could
not
bear
to
discover
to
me
,
be
the
only
reason
of
his
have
so
strenuously
insist
on
our
journey
.
<EOS>
He
then
use
several
very
endearing
expression
,
and
conclude
by
a
very
fond
caress
,
and
many
violent
protestation
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
one
circumstance
which
,
though
he
do
not
appeal
to
it
,
have
much
weight
with
me
in
his
favour
,
and
that
be
the
word
jointure
in
the
taylor
's
letter
,
whereas
my
aunt
never
have
be
marry
,
and
this
Mr
Fitzpatrick
well
know
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
imagine
,
therefore
,
that
the
fellow
must
have
insert
this
of
his
own
head
,
or
from
hearsay
,
I
persuade
myself
he
may
have
venture
likewise
on
that
odious
line
on
no
well
authority
.
<EOS>
what
reasoning
be
this
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
be
I
not
an
advocate
rather
than
a
judge
?
 
<EOS>
but
why
do
I
mention
such
a
circumstance
as
this
,
or
appeal
to
it
for
the
justification
of
my
forgiveness
?
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
have
he
be
guilty
of
twenty
time
as
much
,
<EOS>
half
the
tenderness
and
fondness
which
he
use
would
have
prevail
on
me
to
have
forgive
him
.
<EOS>
I
now
make
no
farther
objection
to
our
set
out
,
which
we
do
the
next
morning
,
and
in
a
little
more
than
a
week
arrive
at
the
seat
of
Mr
Fitzpatrick
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
curiosity
will
excuse
me
from
relate
any
occurrence
which
past
during
our
journey
;
for
it
would
indeed
be
highly
disagreeable
to
travel
it
over
again
,
and
no
less
so
to
you
to
travel
it
over
with
me

<EOS>
"
this
seat
,
then
,
be
an
ancient
mansion

if
I
be
in
one
of
those
merry
humour
in
which
you
have
so
often
see
me

I
could
describe
it
to
you
ridiculously
enough

It
look
as
if
it

be
formerly

a
gentleman

here
be
room
enough

be
very
little

it

the

gloomy

melancholy

that
it
throw
my

into
the
low
dejection

which
my

discern

instead
of
relieve

encrease
by
two

three
malicious
observation
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
good
house

he

as
you
find

in

Bath

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
happy
,
my

be
the
woman
who
,
in
any
state
of
life
,
hath
a
cheerful
good
-
natured
companion
to
support
and
comfort
her
!
<EOS>
but
why
do
I
reflect
on
happy
situation
only
to
aggravate
my
own
misery
?
<EOS>
my
companion
,
far
from
clear
up
the
gloom
of
solitude
,
soon
convince
me
that
I
must
have
be
wretche
with
him
in
any
place
,
and
in
any
condition
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
he
be
a
surly
fellow
,
a
character
perhaps
you
have
never
see
;
for
,
indeed
,
no
woman
ever
see
it
exemplified
but
in
a
father
,
a
brother
,
or
a
husband
;
and
,
though
you
have
a
father
,
he
be
not
of
that
character
.
<EOS>
this
surly
fellow
have
formerly
appear
to
me
the
very
reverse
,
and
so
he
do
still
to
every
other
person
.
<EOS>
Good
heaven
!
<EOS>
how
be
it
possible
for
a
man
to
maintain
a
constant
lie
in
his
appearance
abroad
and
in
company
,
and
to
content
himself
with
shew
disagreeable
truth
only
at
home
?
<EOS>
here
,
my
dear
,
they
make
themselves
amend
for
the
uneasy
restraint
which
they
put
on
their
temper
in
the
world
;
for
I
have
observe
,
the
more
merry
and
gay
and
good
-
humoured
my
husband
hath
at
any
time
be
in
company
,
the
more
sullen
and
morose
<EOS>
he
be
sure
to
become
at
our
next
private
meeting
.
<EOS>
how
shall
I
describe
his
barbarity
?
<EOS>
to
my
fondness
he
be
cold
and
insensible
.
<EOS>
My
little
comical
way
,
which
you
,
my
Sophy
,
and
which
other
,
have
call
so
agreeable
,
he
treat
with
contempt
.
<EOS>
in
my
most
serious
moment
he
sing
and
whistle
;
and
whenever
I
be
thoroughly
deject
and
miserable
he
be
angry
,
and
abuse
me
:
for
,
though
he
be
never
pleased
with
my
good
-
humour
,
nor
ascribe
it
to
my
satisfaction
in
him
,
yet
my
low
spirit
always
offend
him
,
and
those
he
impute
to
my
repentance
of
have
(
as
he
say
)
marry
an
Irishman
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
easily
conceive
,
my
dear
Graveairs
(
I
ask
your
pardon
,
I
really
forget
myself
)
,
that
,
when
a
woman
make
an
imprudent
match
in
the
sense
of
the
world
,
that
is
,
when
she
be
not
an
arrant
prostitute
to
pecuniary
interest
,
she
must
necessarily
have
some
inclination
and
affection
for
her
man
.
<EOS>
You
will
as
easily
believe
that
this
affection
may
possibly
be
lessen
;
nay
,
I
do
assure
you
,
contempt
will
wholly
eradicate
it
.
<EOS>
this
contempt
I
now
begin
to
entertain
for
my
husband
,
whom
I
now
discover
to
be
 
<EOS>
I
must
use
the
expression
 
an
arrant
blockhead
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
will
wonder
I
do
not
make
this
discovery
long
before
;
but
woman
will
suggest
a
thousand
excuse
to
themselves
for
the
folly
of
those
they
like
:
besides
,
give
me
leave
to
tell
you
,
it
require
a
most
penetrating
eye
to
discern
a
fool
through
the
disguise
of
gaiety
and
good
breeding
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
easily
imagine
that
,
when
I
once
despise
my
husband
,
as
I
confess
to
you
<EOS>
I
soon
do
,
I
must
consequently
dislike
his
company
;
and
indeed
I
have
the
happiness
of
be
very
little
troubled
with
it
;
for
our
house
be
now
most
elegantly
furnish
,
our
cellar
well
stock
,
and
dog
and
horse
provide
in
great
abundance
.
<EOS>
as
my
gentleman
therefore
entertain
his
neighbour
with
great
hospitality
,
so
his
neighbour
resort
to
him
with
great
alacrity
;
and
sport
and
drinking
consume
so
much
of
his
time
,
that
a
small
part
of
his
conversation
,
that
be
to
say
,
of
his
ill
-
humour
,
fall
to
my
share

<EOS>
"
Happy
would
it
have
be
for
me
if
I
could
as
easily
have
avoid
all
other
disagreeable
company
;
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
I
be
confine
to
some
which
constantly
torment
me
;
and
the
more
,
as
I
see
no
prospect
of
be
relieve
from
them

<EOS>
these
companion
be
my
own
rack
thought

which
plague
and
in
a
manner
haunt
me
night
and
day

<EOS>
in
this
situation
I
past
through
a
scene
,
the
horror
of
which
can
neither
be

my

figure

if
you
can

to
yourself

what
I

undergo

a

through
all
the
agony

in
a
desert

or
rather
,
indeed

a
scene
of
riot
and
revel
,
without
a

without
a

or
without
any
of
those
agreeable
circumstance
which
often
alleviate

the

raise
her
anxiety

leave
her
no
appetite

what
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
be
to
satisfy
by
her
relation

<EOS>
the
landlord
now
attend
with
a
plate
under
his
arm
,
and
with
the
same
respect
in
his
countenance
and
address
which
he
would
have
put
on
have
the
lady
arrive
in
a
coach
and
six

<EOS>
the
married
lady
seem
less
affected
with
her
own
misfortune
than
be
her
cousin
;
for
the
former
eat
very
heartily
,
whereas
the
latter
could
hardly
swallow
a
morsel
.
<EOS>
Sophia
likewise
show
more
concern
and
sorrow
in
her
countenance
than
appear
in
the
other
lady
;
who
,
have
observe
these
symptom
in
her
friend
,
beg
her
to
be
comfort
,
say
,
"
perhaps
all
may
yet
end
better
than
either

I

<EOS>
Our

think
he
have
now
an
opportunity
to
open
his
mouth
,

be
resolve
not
to
omit
it

<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry

that
your

<EOS>
a

who
be
here
just
now
bring
excellent
news
;
and
perhaps
some
folk
who
have
give
other
folk
the
slip
may
get
to
London
before
they
be
overtaken

if
they
do

I
make
no

they

<EOS>
all
person
under
the
apprehension

danger
convert
whatever

Sophia

as

Mrs
Honour
,
in
pursuance
of
the

of
her
mistress
,
order
a
bowl
of
punch

invite
my

<EOS>
"
Most
of
the
officer
who
be
quarter
at
a
town
in
our
neighbourhood
be
of
my
husband
's
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
among
these
there
be
a
lieutenant
,
a
very
pretty
sort
of
man
,
and
who
be
marry
to
a
woman
,
so
agreeable
both
in
her
temper
and
conversation
,
that
from
our
first
know
each
other
,
which
be
soon
after
my
lying
-
in
,
we
be
almost
inseparable
companion
;
for
I
have
the
good
fortune
to
make
myself
equally
agreeable
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
lieutenant
,
who
be
neither
a
sot
nor
a
sportsman
,
be
frequently
of
our
party
;
indeed
he
be
very
little
with
my
husband
,
and
no
more
than
good
breeding
constrain
him
to
be
,
as
he
live
almost
constantly
at
our
house
.
<EOS>
My
husband
often
express
much
dissatisfaction
at
the
lieutenant
's
prefer
my
company
to
his
;
he
be
very
angry
with
me
on
that
account
,
and
give
me
many
a
hearty
curse
for
draw
away
his
companion
;
say
,
"
I
ought
to
be
d####n'd
for
have
spoil
one
of
the
pretty
fellow
in
the
world
,
by
make
a
milksop
of
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
mistaken
,
my
dear
Sophia
,
if
you
imagine
that
the
anger
of
my
husband
arise
from
my
deprive
him
of
a
companion
;
for
the
lieutenant
be
not
a
person
with
whose
society
a
fool
could
be
pleased
;
and
,
if
I
should
admit
the
possibility
of
this
,
so
little
right
have
my
husband
to
place
the
loss
of
his
companion
to
me
,
that
I
be
convince
it
be
my
conversation
alone
which
induce
him
ever
to
come
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
no
,
child
,
it
be
envy
,
the
bad
and
most
rancorous
kind
of
envy
,
the
envy
of
superiority
of
understanding
.
<EOS>
the
wretch
could
not
bear
to
see
my
conversation
prefer
to
his
,
by
a
man
of
whom
he
could
not
entertain
the
least
jealousy
.
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
my
dear
Sophy
,
you
be
a
woman
of
sense
;
if
you
marry
a
man
,
as
be
most
probable
you
will
,
of
less
capacity
than
yourself
,
make
frequent
trial
of
his
temper
before
marriage
,
and
see
whether
he
can
bear
to
submit
to
such
a
superiority
.
 
<EOS>
promise
me
,
<EOS>
Sophy
,
you
will
take
this
advice
;
for
you
will
hereafter
find
its
importance
.
"
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
likely
I
shall
never
marry
at
all
,
"
answer
Sophia
;
"
I
think
,
at
least
,
I
shall
never
marry
a
man
in
whose
understanding
I
see
any
defect
before
marriage
;
and
I
promise
you
I
would
rather
give
up
my
own
than
see
any
such
afterwards
.
"
<EOS>
"
give
up
your
understanding
!
"
<EOS>
reply
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
;
"
oh
,
fie
,
child
!
<EOS>
I
will
not
believe
so
meanly
of
you

<EOS>
everything
else
I
may
myself
be
bring
to
give
up
;

never
this

<EOS>
nature
would
not
have
allot
this
superiority
to
the
wife
in
so
many
instance
,
if
she
have
intend
we
should
all
of
us
have
surrender
it
to
the
husband
.
<EOS>
this
,
indeed
,
man
of
sense
never
expect
of
us
;
of
which
the
lieutenant
I
have
just
mention
be
one
notable
example
;
for
though
he
have
a
very
good
understanding
<EOS>
,
he
always
acknowledge
(
as
be
really
true
)
that
his
wife
have
a
well
.
<EOS>
and
this
,
perhaps
,
be
one
reason
of
the
hatred
my
tyrant
bear
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
before
he
would
be
so
govern
by
a
wife
,
he
say
,
especially
such
an
ugly
b
#

(
for
,
indeed
,
she
be
not
a
regular
beauty
,
but
very
agreeable
and
extremely
genteel
)
,
he
would
see
all
the
woman
upon
earth
at
the
devil
,
which
be
a
very
usual
phrase
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
he
wonder
what
I
could
see
in
her
to
be
so
charm
with
her
company
:
since
this
woman
,
say
he
,
hath
come
among
us
<EOS>
,
there
be
an
end
of
your
beloved
reading
,
which
you
pretend
to
like
so
much
,
that
you
could
not
afford
time
to
return
the
visit
of
the
lady
in
this
country
;
and
I
must
confess
I
have
be
guilty
of
a
little
rudeness
this
way
;
for
the
lady
there
be
at
least
no
well
than
the
mere
country
lady
here
;
and
I
think
I
need
make
no
other
excuse
to
you
for
decline
any
intimacy
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
correspondence
,
however
,
continue
a
whole
year
,
even
all
the
while
the
lieutenant
be
quarter
in
that
town
;
for
which
I
be
content
to
pay
the
tax
of
be
constantly
abuse
in
the
manner
above
mention
by
my
husband
;
I
mean
when
he
be
at
home
;
for
he
be
frequently
absent
a
month
at
a
time
at
Dublin
,
and
once
make
a
journey
of
two
month
to
London
:
in
all
which
journey
I
think
it
a
very
singular
happiness
that
he
never
once
desire
my
company
;
nay
,
by
his
frequent
censure
on
man
who
could
not
travel

it

up

my

such

at
length
my

be
remove
from
me
,
and
I
be
again
leave
to
my
solitude
,
to
the
torment
conversation
with
my
own
reflection
,
and
to
apply
to
book
for
my
only
comfort

<EOS>
I
now
read

during

I
write
three
very

I
think

move
letter
to
my

but
,
as
I
receive
no

my
disdain

<EOS>
here

look
earnestly

,
"
Methinks

I
read
something
in

indeed

answer

your

be
an
apology
for

indeed

a
remissness

without
so
good
an
excuse

"
  
<EOS>
thus
,
then
,
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
resume
her
narrative
:
 
<EOS>
"
My
husband
now
take
a
second
journey
to
England
,
where
he
continue
upwards
of
three
month
;
during
the
great
part
of
this
time
I
lead
a
life
which
nothing
but
have
lead
a
bad
could
make
me
think
tolerable
;
for
perfect
solitude
can
never
be
reconcile
to
a
social
mind
,
like
mine
,
but
when
it
relieve
you
from
the
company
of
those
you
hate
.
<EOS>
what
add
to
my
wretchedness
be
the
loss
of
my
little
infant
:
<EOS>
not
that
I
pretend
to
have
have
for
it
that
extravagant
tenderness
of
which
I
believe
I
may
have
be
capable
under
other
circumstance
;
but
I
resolve
,
in
every
instance
,
to
discharge
the
duty
of
the
tender
mother
;
and
this
care
prevent
me
from
feel
the
weight
of
that
heavy
of
all
thing
,
when
it
can
be
at
all
say
to
lie
heavy
on
our
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
spend
full
ten
week
almost
entirely
by
myself
,
have
see
nobody
all
that
time
,
except
my
servant
and
a
very
few
visitor
,
when
a
young
lady
,
a
relation
to
my
husband
,
come
from
a
distant
part
of
Ireland
to
visit
me
.
<EOS>
She
have
staid
once
before
a
week
at
my
house
,
and
then
I
give
her
a
press
invitation
to
return
;
for
she
be
a
very
agreeable
woman
,
and
have
improve
good
natural
part
by
a
proper
education
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
be
to
me
a
welcome
guest
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
few
day
after
her
arrival
,
perceive
me
in
very
low
spirit
,
without
enquire
the
cause
,
which
,
indeed
,
she
very
well
know
,
the
young
lady
fall
to
compassionate
my
case
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
"
though
politeness
have
prevent
me
from
complain
to
my
husband
's
relation
of
his
behaviour
,
yet
they
all
be
very
sensible
of
it
,
and
feel
great
concern
upon
that
account
;
but
none
more
than
herself
.
"
<EOS>
and
after
some
more
general
discourse
on
this
head
,
which
I
own
<EOS>
I
could
not
forbear
countenancing
,
at
last
,
after
much
previous
precaution
and
enjoin
concealment
,
she
communicate
to
me
,
as
a
profound
secret
 
that
my
husband
keep
a
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
certainly
imagine
I
hear
this
news
with
the
utmost
insensibility
 
<EOS>
upon
my
word
,
if
you
do
,
your
imagination
will
mislead
you
.
<EOS>
Contempt
have
not
so
keep
down
my
anger
to
my
husband
,
but
that
hatred
rise
again
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
what
can
be
the
reason
of
this
?
<EOS>
be
we
so
abominably
selfish
,
that
we
can
be
concern
at
other
have
possession
even
of
what
we
despise
?
<EOS>
or
be
we
not
rather
abominably
vain
,
and
be
not
this
the
great
injury
do
to
our
vanity
?
<EOS>
what
think
you
,
Sophia
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
indeed
,
"
answer
Sophia
;
"
I
have
never
trouble
myself
with
any
of
these
deep
contemplation
;
but
I
think
the
lady
do
very
ill
in
communicate
to
you
such
a
secret
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
yet
,
my
dear
,
this
conduct
be
natural

"
reply
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
;
"
and
,
when
you
have
see
and
read
as
much
as
myself
,
you
will
acknowledge
it
to
be
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
to
hear
it
be
natural
,
"
return
Sophia
;
"
for
I
want
neither
read
nor
experience
to
convince
me
that
it
be
very
dishonourable
and
very
ill
-
natured
:
<EOS>
nay
,
it
be
surely
as
ill
-
breed
to
tell
a
husband
or
wife
of
the
fault
of
each
other
as
to
tell
them
of
their
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
continue
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
"
my
husband
at
last
return
;
and
,
if
I
be
thoroughly
acquaint
with
my
own
thought
,
I
hate
him
now
more
than
ever
;
but
I
despise
him
rather
less
:
for
certainly
nothing
so
much
weaken
our
contempt
,
as
an
injury
do
to
our
pride
or
our
vanity
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
now
assume
a
carriage
to
me
so
very
different
from
what
he
have
lately
wear
,
and
so
nearly
resemble
his
behaviour
the
first
week
of
our
marriage
,
that
,
have
I
now
have
any
spark
of
love
remain
,
he
may
,
possibly
,
have
rekindle
my
fondness
for
him
.
<EOS>
but
,
though
hatred
may
succeed
to
contempt
,
and
may
perhaps
get
the
well
of
it
,
love
,
I
believe
,
can
not
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
the
passion
of
love
be
too
restless
to
remain
contented
without
the
gratification
which
it
receive
from
its
object
;
and
one
can
no
more
be
incline
to
love
without
love
than
we
can
have
eye
without
see
.
<EOS>
when
a
husband
,
therefore
,
cease
to
be
the
object
of
this
passion
,
it
be
most
probable
some
other
man
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
my
dear
,
if
your
husband
grow
indifferent
to
you
 
if
you
once
come
to
despise
him
 
<EOS>
I
say
 
that
be
 
if
you
have
the
passion
of
love
in
you
 
Lud
!
<EOS>
I
have
bewilder
myself
<EOS>
so
 
<EOS>
but
one
be
apt
,
in
these
abstract
consideration
,
to
lose
the
concatenation
of
idea
,
as
Mr
Locke
say
:
 
in
short
,
the
truth
be
 
in
short
,
I
scarce
know
what
it
be
;
but
,
as
I
be
say
,
my
husband
return
,
and
his
behaviour
,
at
first
,
greatly
surprize
me
;
but
he
soon
acquaint
me
with
the
motive
,
and
teach
me
to
account
for
it
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
then
,
he
have
spend
and
lose
all
the
ready
money
of
my
fortune
;
and
,
as
he
could
mortgage
his
own
estate
no
deep
,
he
be
now
desirous
to
supply
himself
with
cash
for
his
extravagance
,
by
sell
a
little
estate
of
mine
,
which
he
could
not
do
without
my
assistance
;
and
to
obtain
this
favour
be
the
whole
and
sole
motive
of
all
the
fondness
which
he
now
put
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
with
this
I
peremptorily
refuse
to
comply
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
and
I
tell
him
truly
,
that
,
have
I
be
possess
of
the
Indies
at
our
first
marriage
,
he
may
have
command
it
all
;
for
it
have
be
a
constant
maxim
with
me
,
that
where
a
woman
dispose
of
her
heart
,
she
should
always
deposit
her
fortune
;
but
,
as
he
have
be
so
kind
,
long
ago
,
to
restore
the
former
into
my
possession
,
I
be
resolve
likewise
to
retain
what
little
remain
of
the
latter
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
describe
to
you
the
passion
into
which
these
word
,
and
the
resolute
air
in
which
they
be
speak
,
throw
him
:
nor
will
I
trouble
you
with
the
whole
scene
which
succeed
between
us
.
<EOS>
Out

"
Mr
Fitzpatrick
seem
a
little
thunderstruck
with
this
,
and
more
confused
than
I
have
see
him
,
though
his
idea
be
always
confused
enough
,
heaven
know

<EOS>
He
do
not
,
however
,
endeavour
to
exculpate
himself
;
but
take
a
method
which
almost
equally
confound
me
.
<EOS>
what
be
this
but
recrimination
?
<EOS>
He
affect
to
be
jealous
:
 
he
may
,
for
aught
I
know
,
be
incline
enough
to
jealousy
in
his
natural
temper
;
<EOS>
nay
,
he
must
have
have
it
from
nature
,
or
the
devil
must
have
put
it
into
his
head
;
for
I
defy
all
the
world
to
cast
a
just
aspersion
on
my
character
:
nay
,
the
most
scandalous
tongue
have
never
dare
censure
my
reputation
.
<EOS>
My
fame
,
I
thank
heaven
,
hath
be
always
as
spotless

my

let
falsehood
itself
accuse
that

it

<EOS>
no

my

however
ill

I

firmly
resolve
never

give
the

censure
on
this
account

<EOS>

yet
,
my

there
be
some
people
so
malicious
,
some
tongue
so
venomous
,
that
no
innocence
can
escape
them

<EOS>
the
most
undesigned

the

misconstrue

He

resort
above

this
unaccountable

I

tire
you
already

many
particular

<EOS>
I
will
now
bring
my

to
a
very
speedy
conclusion

<EOS>
in
short
,
then
,
after
many
scene
very
unworthy
to

in

my

engage
so
heartily
on

that
Mr

at
last
turn
her
out

when
he
find
I

neither

soothe
nor
bully
into
compliance

he
take
a
very
violent
method
indeed

<EOS>
perhaps
you
will
conclude
he
beat
me
;
but
this
,
though
he
hath
approach
very
near
to
it
,
he
never
actually
do
.
<EOS>
He
confine
me
to
my
room

without
suffer
me
to
have
either
pen
,
ink
,
paper
,
or
book
:
and
a
servant
every
day
make
my
bed
,
and
bring
me
my
food

<EOS>
"
when
I
have
remain
a
week
under
this
imprisonment

he
make
me
a
visit
,

,
with
the
voice
of
a
schoolmaster
,
or
,
what
be
often
much
the

,
of
a
tyrant

ask
me
,
"
if
I

I
answer

very
stoutly

that
I

here
I
remain
a
fortnight
longer
;
and
,
to
say
the
truth
,
my
constancy
be
almost
subdue

I
begin
to
think
of
submission

when

one
day

in

abroad
for

<EOS>
I
 
<EOS>
at
a

I
begin

give

to
the
utmost
despair
 
everything
would
be
excusable
at
such
a
time
 
at
that
very
time

I
receive

it
would
take
up
an

the

open

I
now
make
haste
to
Dublin

I
immediately
procure
a
passage

my

my

a
tragical
one

I
be
sure

it
be

myself

perhaps

I
ought
rather
to
apologize
to

its
dullness

Sophia
heave
a
deep
sigh

"
indeed

Harriet

I
pity
you
from
my
soul

what
could
you
expect

why

why

would
you
marry
an
Irishman

<EOS>
"
upon

her

"
your
censure

unjust

<EOS>
there
be
,
among
the
irish

man
of
as
much
worth

honour
as
any
among
the
English
:
nay
,
to
speak
the
truth

generosity
of
spirit
be
rather
more
common
among

<EOS>
I
have
know
some
example
there
,
too
,
of
good
husband

and
I
believe
these
be
not
very
plenty
in
England

<EOS>
ask
me
,
rather
,
what
I
could
expect
when
I
marry
a
fool

I
will
tell
you
a
solemn
truth

I
do
not

<EOS>
"
Can
no

altered

you

<EOS>
among
my
acquaintance

the
silly

be
the
bad
husband

I
will
venture
to
assert

as
a
fact

that
a
man
of
sense
rarely
behave
very
ill

a
wife

deserve
very
well

<EOS>
a
dreadful
alarm
in
the
inn
,
with
the
arrival
of
an
unexpected
friend
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
.
 
<EOS>
Sophia
now
,
at
the
desire
of
her
cousin
,
related
 
not
what
follow
,
but
what
hath
go
before
in
this
history
:
for
which
reason
the
reader
will
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
excuse
me
for
not
repeat
it
over
again
.
  
<EOS>
one
remark
,
however
,
I
can
not
forbear
make
on
her
narrative
,
namely
,
that
she
make
no
more
mention
of
Jones
,
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
,
than
if
there
have
be
no
such
person
alive
.
<EOS>
this
I
will
neither
endeavour
to
account
for
nor
to
excuse
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
if
this
may
be
call
a
kind
of
dishonesty
,
it
seem
the
more
inexcusable
,
from
the
apparent
openness
and
explicit
sincerity
of
the
other
lady
.
 
<EOS>
but
so
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
just
as
Sophia
arrive
at
the
conclusion
of
her
story
,
there
arrive
in
the
room
where
the
two
lady
be
sit
a
noise

not
unlike

in
loudness

to
that
of
a
pack
of
hound
just

kennel

,
in
shrillness

to
cat

caterwaul
;

to
screech
owl
;

,
indeed
,
more
like
(

resemble

those

its

duplicity

rich
distillation
from

juniper

<EOS>
the
famous
Nell

,
step
one
day
,
from
a
house
where
she
have
make
a
short
visit
,
into
her
coach
,
see
a
great
mob
assemble
,
and
her
footman
all
bloody
and
dirty
;
the
fellow
,
be
ask
by
his
mistress
<EOS>
the
reason
of
his
being
in

condition

You
blockhead

"
at
this

you

shut

door

"

not

thus
the
passion
of
Mrs
Honour
appear
natural
enough
,
even
if
it
be
to
be
no
otherwise
account
for
;
but
,
in
reality

there
be
another
cause
of
her
anger

for
which
we
must
beg
leave
to
remind
our

of
a
circumstance
mention
in
the
above
simile

there
be
indeed
certain
liquor

be

Cheney
use
to
call
drinking
punch
pour
liquid
fire
down
your
throat
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
Mrs
Honour
have
unluckily
pour
so
much
of
this
liquid
fire
down
her
throat
,
that
the
smoke
of
it
begin
to
ascend
into
her
pericranium
and
blind
the
eye
of
Reason
,
which
be
there
suppose
to
keep
her
residence
,
while
the
fire
itself
from
the
stomach
easily
reach
the
heart
,
and
there
inflame
the
noble
passion
of
pride
.
<EOS>
so
that
,
upon
the
whole
,
we
shall
cease
to
wonder
at
the
violent
rage
of
the
waiting
-
woman
;
though
at
first
sight
we
must
confess
the
cause
seem
inadequate
to
the
effect
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
and
her
cousin
both
do
all
in
their
power
to
extinguish
these
flame
which
have
roar
so
loudly
all
over
the
house
.
<EOS>
They
at
length
prevail
;
or
,
to
carry
the
metaphor
one
step
farther
,
the
fire
,
have
consume
all
the
fuel
which
the
language
afford
,
to
wit
,
every
reproachful
term
in
it
<EOS>
,
at
last
go
out
of
its
own
accord
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
though
tranquillity
be
restore
above
-
stair
,
it
be
not
so
below
;
where
my
landlady
,
highly
resent
the
injury
do
to
the
beauty
of
her
husband
by
the
flesh
-
spade
of
Mrs
Honour
,
call
aloud
for
revenge
and
justice
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
poor
man
,
who
have
principally
suffer
in
the
engagement
,
he
be
perfectly
quiet
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
blood
which
he
lose
may
have
cool
his
anger
:
for
the
enemy
have
not
only
apply
her
nail
to
his
cheek
,
but
likewise
her
fist
to
his
nostril
,
which
lament
the
blow
with
tear
of
blood
in
great
abundance
.
<EOS>
to
this
we
may
add
reflection
on
his
mistake
;
but
indeed
nothing
so
effectually
silence
his
resentment
as
the
manner
in
which
he
now
discover
his
error
;
for
as
to
the
behaviour
of
Mrs
Honour
,
it
have
the
more
confirm
him
in
his
opinion
;
but
he
be
now
assure
by
a
person
of
great
figure
,
and
who
be
attend
by
a
great
equipage
,
that
one
of
the
lady
be
a
woman
of
fashion
,
and
his
intimate
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
order
of
this
person
,
the
landlord
now
ascend
,
and
acquaint
our
fair
traveller
that
a
great
gentleman
below
desire
to
do
them
the
honour
of
wait
on
them
.
<EOS>
Sophia
turn
pale
and
tremble
at
this
message
,
though
the
reader
will
conclude
it
be
too
civil
,
notwithstanding
the
landlord
's
blunder
,
to
have
come
from
her
father
;
but
fear
hath
<EOS>
the
common
fault
of
a
justice
of
peace
,
and
be
apt
to
conclude
hastily
from
every
slight
circumstance
,
without
examine
the
evidence
on
both
side
.
  
<EOS>
to
ease
the
reader
's
curiosity
,
therefore
,
rather
than
his
apprehension
,
we
proceed
to
inform
him
that
an
irish
peer
have
arrive
very
late
that
evening
at
the
inn
,
in
his
way
to
London
.
<EOS>
this
nobleman
,
have
sally
from
his
supper
at
the
hurricane
before
commemorate
,
have
see
the
attendant
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
and
upon
a
short
enquiry
,
be
inform
that
her
lady
,
with
whom
he
be
very
particularly
acquaint
,
be
above
.
<EOS>
this
information
he
have
no
sooner
receive
than
he
address
himself
to
the
landlord
,
pacify
him
,
and
send
him
upstairs
with
compliment
rather
civiller
than
those
which
be
deliver
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
perhaps
be
wonder
at
that
the
wait
-
woman
herself
be
not
the
messenger
employ
on
this
occasion
;
but
we
be
sorry
to
say
she
be
not
at
present
qualified
for
that
,
or
indeed
for
any
other
office
.
<EOS>
the
rum
(
for
so
the
landlord
choose
to
call
the
distillation
from
malt
)
have
basely
take
the
advantage
of
the
fatigue
which
the
poor
woman
have
undergo
,
and
have
make
terrible
depredation
on
her
noble
faculty
,
at
a
time
when
they
be
very
unable
to
resist
the
attack
.
  
<EOS>
We
shall
not
describe
this
tragical
scene
too
fully
;
but
we
think
ourselves
oblige
,
by
that
historic
integrity
which
we
profess
,
shortly
to
hint
a
matter
which
we
would
otherwise
have
be
glad
to
have
spare
.
<EOS>
many
historian
,
indeed
,
for
want
of
this
integrity
,
or
of
diligence
,
to
say
no
bad
,
often
leave
the
reader
to
find
out
these
little
circumstance
in
the
dark
,
and
sometimes
to
his
great
confusion
and
perplexity
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
be
very
soon
ease
of
her
causeless
fright
by
the
entry
of
the
noble
peer
,
who
be
not
only
an
intimate
acquaintance
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
but
in
reality
a
very
particular
friend
of
that
lady
.
<EOS>
to
say
truth
,
it
be
by
his
assistance
that
she
have
be
enable
to
escape
from
her
husband
;
for
this
nobleman
have
the
same
gallant
disposition
with
those
renowned
knight
of
whom
we
read
in
heroic
story
,
and
have
deliver
many
an
imprison
nymph
from
durance
.
<EOS>
He
be
indeed
as
bitter
an
enemy
to
the
savage
authority
too
often
exercise
by
husband
and
father
,
over
the
young
and
lovely
of
the
other
sex
,
as
ever
knight
-
errant
be
to
the
barbarous
power
of
enchanter
;
<EOS>
nay
,
to
say
truth
,
I
have
often
suspect
that
those
very
enchanter
with
which
romance
everywhere
abound
be
in
reality
no
other
than
the
husband
of
those
day
;
and
matrimony
itself
be
,
perhaps
,
the
enchanted
castle
in
which
the
nymph
be
say
to
be
confine
.
  
<EOS>
this
nobleman
have
an
estate
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Fitzpatrick
,
and
have
be
for
some
time
acquaint
with
the
lady
.
<EOS>
no
sooner
,
therefore
,
do
he
hear
of
her
confinement
,
than
he
earnestly
apply
himself
to
procure
her
liberty
;
which
he
presently
effect
,
not
by
storm
the
castle
,
accord
to
the
example
of
antient
hero
,
but
by
corrupt
the
governor
,
in
conformity
with
the
modern
art
of
war
,
in
which
craft
be
hold
to
be
preferable
to
valour
,
and
gold
be
find
to
be
more
irresistible
than
either
lead
or
steel
.
  
<EOS>
this
circumstance
,
however
,
as
the
lady
do
not
think
it
material
enough
to
relate
to
her
friend
,
we
would
not
at
that
time
impart
it
to
the
reader
.
<EOS>
We
rather
choose
to
leave
him
a
while
under
a
supposition
that
she
have
find
,
or
coin
,
or
by
some
very
extraordinary
,
perhaps
supernatural
mean
,
have
possess
herself
of
the
money
with
which
she
have
bribe
her
keeper
,
than
to
interrupt
her
narrative
by
give
a
hint
of
what
seem
to
her
of
too
little
importance
to
be
mention
.
  
<EOS>
the
peer
,
after
a
short
conversation
,
could
not
forbear
express
some
surprize
at
meet
the
lady
in
that
place
;
nor
could
he
refrain
from
tell
her
he
imagine
she
have
be
go
to
Bath
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
very
freely
answer
,
"
that
she
have
be
prevent
in
her
purpose
by
the
arrival
of
a
person
she
nee
not
mention
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
be
overtake
by
my
husband
(
for
I
need
not
affect
to
conceal
what
the
world
know
too
well
already
)
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
good
fortune
to
escape
in
a
most
surprizing
manner
,
and
be
now
go
to
London
with
this
young
lady
,
who
be
a
near
relation
of
mine
,
and
who
hath
escape
from
as
great
a
tyrant
as
my
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
,
conclude
that
this
tyrant
be
likewise
a
husband
,
make
a
speech
full
of
compliment
to
both
the
lady
,
and
as
full
of
invective
against
his
own
sex
;
nor
indeed
do
he
avoid
some
oblique
glance
at
the
matrimonial
institution
itself
,
and
at
the
unjust
power
give
by
it
to
man
over
the
more
sensible
and
more
meritorious
part
of
the
specie
.
<EOS>
He
end
his
oration
with
an
offer
of
his
protection
,
and
of
his
coach
and
six
,
which
be
instantly
accept
by
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
and
at
last
,
upon
her
persuasion
,
by
Sophia
.
  
<EOS>
matter
be
thus
adjust
,
his
lordship
take
his
leave
,
and
the
lady
retire
to
rest
,
where
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
entertain
her
cousin
with
many
high
encomium
on
the
character
of
the
noble
peer
,
and
enlarge
very
particularly
on
his
great
fondness
for
his
wife
;
say
,
she
believe
he
be
almost
the
only
person
of
high
rank
who
be
entirely
constant
to
the
marriage
bed
.
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
"
add
she
,
"
my
dear
Sophy
,
that
be
a
very
rare
virtue
amongst
man
of
condition
.
<EOS>
never
expect
it
when
you
marry
;
for
,
believe
me
,
if
you
do
,
you
will
certainly
be
deceive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
a
gentle
sigh
stole
from
Sophia
at
these
word
,
which
perhaps
contribute
to
form
a
dream
of
no
very
pleasant
kind
;
but
,
as
she
never
reveal
this
dream
to
any
one
,
so
the
reader
can
not
expect
to
see
it
relate
here
.
    
<EOS>
the
morning
introduce
in
some
pretty
writing
.
<EOS>
a
stagecoach
.
<EOS>
the
civility
of
chambermaid
.
<EOS>
the
heroic
temper
of
Sophia
.
<EOS>
Her
generosity
.
<EOS>
the
return
to
it
.
<EOS>
the
departure
of
the
company
,
and
their
arrival
at
London
;
with
some
remark
for
the
use
of
traveller
.
 
<EOS>
those
member
of
society
who
be
bear
to
furnish
the
blessing
of
life
now
begin
to
light
their
candle
,
in
order
to
pursue
their
daily
labour
for
the
use
of
those
who
be
bear
to
enjoy
these
blessing
.
<EOS>
the
sturdy
hind
now
attend
the
levee
of
his
fellow
-
labourer
the
ox
;
<EOS>
the
cunning
artificer
,
the
diligent
mechanic
,
spring
from
their
hard
mattress
;
and
now
the
bonny
housemaid
begin
to
repair
the
disorder
drum
-
room
,
while
the
riotous
author
of
that
disorder
,
in
break
interrupted
slumber
,
tumble
and
toss
,
as
if
the
hardness
of
down
disquiet
their
repose
.
  
<EOS>
in
simple
phrase
,
the
clock
have
no
sooner
strike
seven
than
the
lady
be
ready
for
their
journey
;
and
,
at
their
desire
,
his
lordship
and
his
equipage
be
prepared
to
attend
them
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
a
matter
of
some
difficulty
arise
;
and
this
be
how
his
lordship
himself
should
be
convey
;
for
though
in
stage
-
coach
,
where
passenger
be
properly
consider
as
so
much
luggage
,
the
ingenious
coachman
stow
half
a
dozen
with
perfect
ease
into
the
place
of
four
;
for
well
he
contrive
that
the
fat
hostess
,
or
well
-
feed
alderman
,
may
take
up
no
more
room
than
the
slim
miss
,
or
taper
master
;
it
be
the
nature
of
gut
,
when
well
squeeze
,
to
give
way
,
and
to
lie
in
a
narrow
compass
;
yet
in
these
vehicle
,
which
be
call
,
for
distinction
's
sake
,
gentleman
's
coach
,
though
they
be
often
large
than
the
other
,
this
method
of
packing
be
never
attempt
.
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
would
have
put
a
short
end
to
the
difficulty
,
by
very
gallantly
desire
to
mount
his
horse
;
but
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
would
by
no
means
consent
to
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
therefore
conclude
that
the
Abigails
should
,
by
turn
,
relieve
each
other
on
one
of
his
lordship
's
horse
,
which
be
presently
equip
with
a
side
-
saddle
for
that
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
everything
be
settle
at
the
inn
,
the
lady
discharge
their
former
guide
,
and
Sophia
make
a
present
to
the
landlord
,
partly
to
repair
the
bruise
which
he
have
receive
under
herself
,
and
partly
on
account
of
what
he
have
suffer
under
the
hand
of
her
enraged
waiting
-
woman
.
<EOS>
and
now
Sophia
first
discover
a
loss
which
give
her
some
uneasiness
;
and
this
be
of
the
hundred
-
pound
bank
-
bill
which
her
father
have
give
her
at
their
last
meeting
;
and
which
,
within
a
very
inconsiderable
trifle
,
be
all
the
treasure
she
be
at
present
worth
.
<EOS>
She
search
everywhere
,
and
shake
and
tumble
all
her
thing
to
no
purpose
,
the
bill
be
not
to
be
find
:
and
she
be
at
last
fully
persuade
that
she
have
lose
it
from
her
pocket
when
she
have
the
misfortune
of
tumble
from
her
horse
in
the
dark
lane
,
as
before
record
:
a
fact
that
seem
the
more
probable
,
as
she
now
recollect
some
discomposure
in
her
pocket
which
have
happen
at
that
time
,
and
the
great
difficulty
with
which
she
have
draw
forth
her
handkerchief
the
very
instant
before
her
fall
,
in
order
to
relieve
the
distress
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
.
  
<EOS>
misfortune
of
this
kind
,
whatever
inconveniencie
they
may
be
attend
with
,
be
incapable
of
subdue
a
mind
in
which
there
be
any
strength
,
without
the
assistance
of
avarice
.
<EOS>
Sophia
,
therefore
,
though
nothing
could
be
bad
time
than
this
accident
at
such
a
season
,
immediately
get
the
well
of
her
concern
,
and
,
with
her
wonted
serenity
and
cheerfulness
of
countenance
,
return
to
her
company
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
conduct
the
lady
into
the
vehicle
,
as
he
do
likewise
Mrs
Honour
,
who
,
after
many
civility
,
and
more
dear
madam
,
at
last
yield
to
the
well
-
breed
importunity
of
her
sister
Abigail
,
and
submit
to
be
compliment
with
the
first
ride
in
the
coach
;
in
which
indeed
she
would
afterwards
have
be
content
to
have
pursue
her
whole
journey
,
have
not
her
mistress
,
after
several
fruitless
intimation
,
at
length
force
her
to
take
her
turn
on
horseback
.
  
<EOS>
the
coach
,
now
have
receive
its
company
,
begin
to
move
forwards
,
attend
by
many
servant
,
and
lead
by
two
captain
,
who
have
before
rode
with
his
lordship
,
and
who
would
have
be
dismiss
from
the
vehicle
upon
a
much
less
worthy
occasion
than
be
this
of
accommodate
two
lady
.
<EOS>
in
this
they
act
only
as
gentleman
;
but
they
be
ready
at
any
time
to
have
perform
the
office
of
a
footman
,
or
indeed
would
have
condescend
low
,
for
the
honour
of
his
lordship
's
company
,
and
for
the
convenience
of
his
table
.
  
<EOS>
My
landlord
be
so
pleased
with
the
present
he
have
receive
from
Sophia
,
that
he
rather
rejoice
in
than
regret
his
bruise
or
his
scratch
.
<EOS>
the
reader
will
perhaps
be
curious
to
know
the
quantum
of
this
present
;
but
we
can
not
satisfy
his
curiosity
.
<EOS>
whatever
it
be
,
it
satisfy
the
landlord
for
his
bodily
hurt
;
but
he
lament
he
have
not
know
before
how
little
the
lady
value
her
money
;
"
for
to
be
sure
,
"
say
he
,
"
one
may
have
charge
every
article
double
,
and
she
would
have
make
no
cavil
at
the
reckoning
.

<EOS>
His
wife
,
however
,
be
far
from
draw
this
conclusion
;
whether
she
really
feel
any
injury
do
to
her
husband
more
than
he
do
himself
,
I
will
not
say
:
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
she
be
much
less
satisfied
with
the
generosity
of
Sophia
.
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
"
cry
she
,
"
my
dear
,
the
lady
know
better
how
to
dispose
of
her
money
than
you
imagine
.
<EOS>
She
may
very
well
think
we
should
not
put
up
such
a
business
without
some
satisfaction
,
and
the
law
would
have
cost
her
an
infinite
deal
more
than
this
poor
little
matter
,
which
I
wonder
you
would
take
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
be
always
so
bloodily
wise
,
"
quoth
the
husband
<EOS>
:
"
it
would
have
cost
her
more
,
would
it
?
<EOS>
dost
fancy
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
as
well
as
thee
?
<EOS>
but
would
any
of
that
more
,
or
so
much
,
have
come
into
our
pocket
?
<EOS>
indeed
,
if
son
Tom
the
lawyer
have
be
alive
,
I
could
have
be
glad
to
have
put
such
a
pretty
business
into
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
get
a
good
picking
out
of
it
;
but
I
have
no
relation
now
who
be
a
lawyer
,
and
why
should
I
go
to
law
for
the
benefit
of
stranger
?
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
to
be
sure
,
"
answer
she
,
"
you
must
know
best
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
do
,
"
reply
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
,
when
money
be
to
be
get
,
I
can
smell
it
out
as
well
as
another
.
<EOS>
everybody
,
let
me
tell
you
,
would
not
have
talk
people
out
of
this
.
<EOS>
mind
that
,
I
say
;
everybody
would
not
have
cajole
this
out
of
her
<EOS>
,
mind
that
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
wife
then
join
in
the
applause
of
her
husband
's
sagacity
;
and
thus
end
the
short
dialogue
between
them
on
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
We
will
therefore
take
our
leave
of
these
good
people
,
and
attend
his
lordship
and
his
fair
companion
,
who
make
such
good
expedition
that
they
perform
a
journey
of
ninety
mile
in
two
day
,
and
on
the
second
evening
arrive
in
London
,
without
have
encounter
any
one
adventure
on
the
road
worthy
the
dignity
of
this
history
to
relate
.
<EOS>
Our
pen
,
therefore
,
shall
imitate
the
expedition
which
it
describe
,
and
our
history
shall
keep
pace
with
the
traveller
who
be
its
subject
.
<EOS>
good
writer
will
,
indeed
,
do
well
to
imitate
the
ingenious
traveller
in
this
instance
,
who
always
proportion
his
stay
at
any
place
to
the
beauty
,
elegancie
,
and
curiosity
which
it
afford
.
<EOS>
at
Eshur

at
Stowe

at
Wilton

at
Eastbury

and
at
Prior

day
be
too
short
for
the
ravished
imagination

we
admire
the
wondrous
power
of
art

improve

<EOS>
in
some
of
these

art
chiefly
engage
our
admiration
;
in
other
,
nature
and
art
contend
for
our
applause
;
but
,
in
the
last
,
the
former
seem
to
triumph

<EOS>
here
Nature
appear
in
her
rich
attire

Art

with
the
modest

<EOS>
here
Nature
indeed
pour

the

she
hath
lavish

and
here
human

present
you
with
an

the

which
luxuriously

in
these
elegant

can

with
object
of
far
inferior
note

<EOS>
the
wood
,
the
river
,
the
lawn
of
Devon
and
of
Dorset
,
attract
the
eye
of
the
ingenious
traveller
,
and
retard
his
pace
,
which
delay
he
afterwards
compensate
by
swiftly
scour
over
the
gloomy
heath
of
Bagshot
,
or
that
pleasant
plain
which
extend
itself
westward
from
Stockbridge

no

<EOS>
and
now
,

as
we
be
in

to
attend
our

we
will
leave
to
thy

to
apply
all

this
thou

bestir
thyself
therefore
on

;
for

though
we

always
lend

proper

we

highly

,
when

to

<EOS>
contain
a
hint
or
two
concern
virtue
,
and
a
few
more
concern
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
Our
company
,
be
arrive
at
London
,
be
set
down
at
his
lordship
's
house
,
where
,
while
they
refresh
themselves
after
the
fatigue
of
their
journey
,
servant
be
despatch
to
provide
a
lodging
for
the
two
lady
;
for
,
as
her
ladyship
be
not
then
in
town
,
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
would
by
no
means
consent
to
accept
a
bed
in
the
mansion
of
the
peer
.
  
<EOS>
some
reader
will
,
perhaps
,
condemn
this
extraordinary
delicacy
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
of
virtue
,
as
too
nice
and
scrupulous
;
but
we
must
make
allowance
for
her
situation
,
which
must
be
own
to
have
be
very
ticklish
;
and
,
when
we
consider
the
malice
of
censorious
tongue
,
we
must
allow
,
if
it
be
a
fault
,
the
fault
be
an
excess
on
the
right
side
,
and
which
every
woman
who
be
in
the
self
-
same
situation
will
do
well
to
imitate
.
<EOS>
the
most
formal
appearance
of
virtue
,
when
it
be
only
an
appearance
,
may
,
perhaps
,
in
very
abstract
consideration
,
seem
to
be
rather
less
commendable
than
virtue
itself
without
this
formality
;
but
it
will
,
however
,
be
always
more
commended
;
and
this
,
I
believe
,
will
be
grant
by
all
,
that
it
be
necessary
,
unless
in
some
very
particular
case
,
for
every
woman
to
support
either
the
one
or
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
a
lodging
be
prepare
,
Sophia
accompany
her
cousin
for
that
evening
;
but
resolve
early
in
the
morning
to
enquire
after
the
lady
into
whose
protection
,
as
we
have
formerly
mention
,
she
have
determine
to
throw
herself
when
she
quit
her
father
's
house
.
<EOS>
and
this
she
be
the
more
eager
in
do
from
some
observation
she
have
make
during
her
journey
in
the
coach
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
as
we
would
by
no
means
fix
the
odious
character
of
suspicion
on
Sophia
,
we
be
almost
afraid
to
open
to
our
reader
the
conceit
which
fill
her
mind
concern
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
;
of
whom
she
certainly
entertain
at
present
some
doubt
;
which
,
as
they
be
very
apt
to
enter
into
the
bosom
of
the
bad
of
people
,
we
think
proper
not
to
mention
more
plainly
till
we
have
first
suggest
a
word
or
two
to
our
reader
touch
suspicion
in
general
.
  
<EOS>
of
this
there
have
always
appear
to
me
to
be
two
degree
.
<EOS>
the
first
of
these
I
chuse
to
derive
from
the
heart
,
as
the
extreme
velocity
of
its
discernment
seem
to
denote
some
previous
inward
impulse
,
and
the
rather
as
this
superlative
degree
often
form
its
own
object
;
see
what
be
not
,
and
always
more
than
really
exist
.
<EOS>
this
be
that
quick
-
sight
penetration
whose
hawk
's
eye
<EOS>
no
symptom
of
evil
can
escape
;
which
observe
not
only
upon
the
action
,
but
upon
the
word
and
look
,
of
man
;
and
,
as
it
proceed
from
the
heart
of
the
observer
,
so
it
dive
into
the
heart
of
the
observe
,
and
there
espie
evil
,
as
it
be
,
in
the
first
embryo
;
nay
,
sometimes
before
it
can
be
say
to
be
conceive
.
<EOS>
an
admirable
faculty
,
if
it
be
infallible
;
but
,
as
this
degree
of
perfection
be
not
even
claim
by
more
than
one
mortal
being
;
so
from
the
fallibility
of
such
acute
discernment
have
arise
many
sad
mischief
and
most
grievous
heart
-
ache
to
innocence
and
virtue
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
,
therefore
,
regard
this
vast
quick
-
sightedness
into
evil
as
a
vicious
excess
,
and
as
a
very
pernicious
evil
in
itself
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
the
more
inclined
to
this
opinion
,
as
I
be
afraid
it
always
proceed
from
a
bad
heart
,
for
the
reason
I
have
above
mention
,
and
for
one
more
,
namely
,
because
I
never
know
it
the
property
of
a
good
one
.
<EOS>
now
,
from
this
degree
of
suspicion
I
entirely
and
absolutely
acquit
Sophia
.
  
<EOS>
a
second
degree
of
this
quality
seem
to
arise
from
the
head
.
<EOS>
this
be
,
indeed
,
no
other
than
the
faculty
of
see
what
be
before
your
eye
,
and
of
draw
conclusion
from
what
you
see
.
<EOS>
the
former
of
these
be
unavoidable
by
those
who
have
any
eye
,
and
the
latter
be
perhaps
no
less
certain
and
necessary
a
consequence
of
our
have
any
brain
.
<EOS>
this
be
altogether
as
bitter
an
enemy
to
guilt
as
the
former
be
to
innocence
:
nor
can
I
see
it
in
an
unamiable
light
,
even
though
,
through
human
fallibility
,
it
should
be
sometimes
mistake
.
<EOS>
for
instance
,
if
a
husband
should
accidentally
surprize
his
wife
in
the
lap
or
in
the
embrace
of
some
of
those
pretty
young
gentleman
who
profess
the
art
of
cuckold
-
making
,
I
should
not
highly
,
I
think
,
blame
him
for
conclude
something
more
than
what
he
see
,
from
the
familiarity
which
he
really
have
see
,
and
which
we
be
at
least
favourable
enough
to
when
we
call
them
innocent
freedom
.
<EOS>
the
reader
will
easily
suggest
great
plenty
of
instance
to
himself
;
I
shall
add
but
one
more
,
which
,
however
unchristian
it
may
be
think
by
some
,
I
can
not
help
esteem
to
be
strictly
justifiable
;
and
this
be
a
suspicion
that
a
man
be
capable
of
do
what
he
hath
do
already
,
and
that
it
be
possible
for
one
who
hath
be
a
villain
once
to
act
the
same
part
again
.
<EOS>
and
,
to
confess
the
truth
,
of
this
degree
of
suspicion
I
believe
Sophia
be
guilty
.
<EOS>
from
this
degree
of
suspicion
she
have
,
in
fact
,
conceive
an
opinion
that
her
cousin
be
really
not
well
than
she
should
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
case
,
it
seem
,
be
this
:
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
wisely
consider
that
the
virtue
of
a
young
lady
be
,
in
the
world
,
in
the
same
situation
with
a
poor
hare
,
which
be
certain
,
whenever
it
venture
abroad
,
to
meet
its
enemy
;
for
it
can
hardly
meet
any
other
.
<EOS>
no
sooner
therefore
be
she
determine
to
take
the
first
opportunity
of
quit
the
protection
of
her
husband
,
than
she
resolve
to
cast
herself
under
the
protection
of
some
other
man
;
and
whom
could
she
so
properly
choose
to
be
her
guardian
as
a
person
of
quality
,
of
fortune
,
of
honour
;
and
who
,
besides
a
gallant
disposition
which
incline
man
to
knight
-
errantry
,
that
is
,
to
be
the
champion
of
lady
in
distress
,
have
often
declare
a
violent
attachment
to
herself
,
and
have
already
give
her
all
the
instance
of
it
in
his
power
?
  
<EOS>
but
,
as
the
law
hath
foolishly
omit
this
office
of
vice
-
husband
,
or
guardian
to
an
eloped
lady
,
and
as
malice
be
apt
to
denominate
him
by
a
more
disagreeable
appellation
,
it
be
conclude
that
his
lordship
should
perform
all
such
kind
office
to
the
lady
in
secret
,
and
without
publickly
assume
the
character
of
her
protector
.
<EOS>
nay
,
to
prevent
any
other
person
from
see
him
in
this
light
,
it
be
agree
that
the
lady
should
proceed
directly
to
Bath
,
and
that
his
lordship
should
first
go
to
London
,
and
thence
should
go
down
to
that
place
by
the
advice
of
his
physician
.
  
<EOS>
now
all
this
Sophia
very
plainly
understand
,
not
from
the
lip
or
behaviour
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
but
from
the
peer
,
who
be
infinitely
less
expert
at
retain
a
secret
than
be
the
good
lady
;
and
perhaps
the
exact
secrecy
which
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
have
observe
on
this
head
in
her
narrative
serve
not
a
little
to
heighten
those
suspicion
which
be
now
rise
in
the
mind
of
her
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
very
easily
find
out
the
lady
she
seek
;
for
indeed
there
be
not
a
chairman
in
town
to
whom
her
house
be
not
perfectly
well
known
;
and
,
as
she
receive
,
in
return
of
her
first
message
,
a
most
pressing
invitation
,
she
immediately
accept
it
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
indeed
,
do
not
desire
her
cousin
to
stay
with
her
with
more
earnestness
than
civility
require
.
<EOS>
whether
she
have
discern
and
resent
the
suspicion
above
-
mention
,
or
from
what
other
motive
it
arise
,
I
can
not
say
;
but
certain
it
be
,
she
be
full
as
desirous
of
part
with
Sophia
as
Sophia
herself
<EOS>
could
be
of
go
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
lady
,
when
she
come
to
take
leave
of
her
cousin
,
could
not
avoid
give
her
a
short
hint
of
advice
.
<EOS>
She
beg
her
,
for
heaven
's
sake
,
to
take
care
of
herself
,
and
to
consider
in
how
dangerous
a
situation
she
stand
;
add
,
she
hope
some
method
would
be
find
of
reconcile
her
to
her
husband
.

You
must
remember
,
my
dear
,
"
say
she
,
"
the
maxim
which
my
aunt
western
hath
so
often
repeat
to
us
both
;
that
whenever
the
matrimonial
alliance
be
broke
,
and
war
declare
between
husband
and
wife
,
she
can
hardly
make
a
disadvantageous
peace
for
herself
on
any
condition
.
<EOS>
these
be
my
aunt
's
very
word
,
and
she
hath
have
a
great
deal
of
experience
in
the
world
.

<EOS>
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
answer
,
with
a
contemptuous
smile
,
"
never
fear
me
,
child
,
take
care
of
yourself
;
for
you
be
young
than
I.
I
will
come
and
visit
you
in
a
few
day
;
but
,
dear
Sophy
,
let
me
give
you
one
piece
of
advice
:
leave
the
character
of
Graveairs
in
the
country
,
for
<EOS>
,
believe
me
,
it
will
sit
very
awkwardly
upon
you
in
this
town
.
"
  
<EOS>
thus
the
two
cousin
part
,
and
Sophia
repair
directly
to
Lady
Bellaston
,
where
she
find
a
most
hearty
,
as
well
as
a
most
polite
,
welcome
.
<EOS>
the
lady
have
take
a
great
fancy
to
her
when
she
have
see
her
formerly
with
her
aunt
Western
.
<EOS>
She
be
indeed
extremely
glad
to
see
her
,
and
be
no
sooner
acquaint
with
the
reason
which
induce
her
to
leave
the
squire
and
to
fly
to
London
than
she
highly
applaud
her
sense
and
resolution
;
and
after
express
the
high
satisfaction
in
the
opinion
which
Sophia
have
declare
she
entertain
of
her
ladyship
,
by
chuse
her
house
for
an
asylum
,
she
promise
her
all
the
protection
which
it
be
in
her
power
to
give
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
have
now
bring
Sophia
into
safe
hand
,
the
reader
will
,
I
apprehend
,
be
content
to
deposit
her
there
a
while
,
and
to
look
a
little
after
other
personage
,
and
particularly
poor
Jones
,
whom
we
have
leave
long
enough
to
do
penance
for
his
past
offence
,
which
,
as
be
the
nature
of
vice
,
bring
sufficient
punishment
upon
him
themselves
.

BOOK
XII
.
  
<EOS>
contain
the
same
INDIVIDUAL
time
with
the
former
.
    
<EOS>
show
what
be
to
be
deem
plagiarism
in
a
modern
author
,
and
what
be
to
be
consider
as
lawful
prize
.
 
<EOS>
the
learned
reader
must
have
observe
that
in
the
course
of
this
mighty
work
,
I
have
often
translate
passage
out
of
the
good
antient
author
,
without
quote
the
original
,
or
without
take
the
least
notice
of
the
book
from
whence
they
be
borrow
.
  
<EOS>
this
conduct
in
writing
be
place
in
a
very
proper
light
by
the
ingenious
Abbe
Bannier
,
in
his
preface
to
his
Mythology
,
a
work
of
great
erudition
and
of
equal
judgment
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
easy
,
"
say
he
,
"
for
the
reader
to
observe
that
I
have
frequently
have
great
regard
to
him
than
to
my
own
reputation
:
for
an
author
certainly
pay
him
a
considerable
compliment
,
when
,
for
his
sake
,
he
suppress
learn
quotation
that
come
in
his
way
,
and
which
would
have
cost
him
but
the
bare
trouble
of
transcribe
.
"
  
<EOS>
to
fill
up
a
work
with
these
scrap
may
,
indeed
,
be
consider
as
a
downright
cheat
on
the
learned
world
,
who
be
by
such
mean
impose
upon
to
buy
a
second
time
,
in
fragment
and
by
retail
,
what
they
have
already
in
gross
,
if
not
in
their
memory
,
upon
their
shelf
;
and
it
be
still
more
cruel
upon
the
illiterate
,
who
be
draw
in
to
pay
for
what
be
of
no
manner
of
use
to
them
.
<EOS>
a
writer
who
intermix
great
quantity
of
greek
and
Latin
with
his
work
,
deal
by
the
lady
and
fine
gentleman
in
the
same
paultry
manner
with
which
they
be
treat
by
the
auctioneer
,
who
often
endeavour
so
to
confound
and
mix
up
their
lot
,
that
,
in
order
to
purchase
the
commodity
you
want
,
you
be
oblige
at
the
same
time
to
purchase
that
which
will
do
you
no
service
.
  
<EOS>
and
yet
,
as
there
be
no
conduct
so
fair
and
disintereste
but
that
it
may
be
misunderstood
by
ignorance
,
and
misrepresent
by
malice
,
I
have
be
sometimes
tempt
to
preserve
my
own
reputation
at
the
expense
of
my
reader
,
and
to
transcribe
the
original
,
or
at
least
to
quote
chapter
and
verse
,
whenever
I
have
make
use
either
of
the
thought
or
expression
of
another
.
<EOS>
I
be
,
indeed
,
in
some
doubt
that
I
have
often
suffer
by
the
contrary
method
;
and
that
,
by
suppress
the
original
author
's
name
,
I
have
be
rather
suspect
of
plagiarism
than
repute
to
act
from
the
amiable
motive
assign
by
that
justly
celebrate
Frenchman
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
to
obviate
all
such
imputation
for
the
future
,
I
do
here
confess
and
justify
the
fact
.
<EOS>
the
antient
may
be
consider
as
a
rich
common
,
where
every
person
who
hath
the
small
tenement
in
Parnassus
hath
a
free
right
to
fatten
his
muse
.
<EOS>
or
,
to
place
it
in
a
clear
light
,
we
modern
be
to
the
antient
what
the
poor
be
to
the
rich
.
<EOS>
by
the
poor
here
<EOS>
I
mean
that
large
and
venerable
body
which
,
in
English
,
we
call
the
mob
.
<EOS>
now
,
whoever
hath
have
the
honour
to
be
admit
to
any
degree
of
intimacy
with
this
mob
<EOS>
,
must
well
know
that
it
be
one
of
their
establish
maxim
to
plunder
and
pillage
their
rich
neighbour
without
any
reluctance
;
and
that
this
be
hold
to
be
neither
sin
nor
shame
among
them
.
<EOS>
and
so
constantly
do
they
abide
and
act
by
this
maxim
,
that
,
in
every
parish
almost
in
the
kingdom
,
there
be
a
kind
of
confederacy
ever
carry
on
against
a
certain
person
of
opulence
call
the
squire
,
whose
property
be
consider
as
free
-
booty
by
all
his
poor
neighbour
;
who
,
as
they
conclude
that
there
be
no
manner
of
guilt
in
such
depredation
,
look
upon
it
as
a
point
of
honour
and
moral
obligation
to
conceal
,
and
to
preserve
each
other
from
punishment
on
all
such
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
in
like
manner
be
the
antient
,
such
as
Homer
,
Virgil
,
Horace
,
Cicero
,
and
the
rest
,
to
be
esteem
among
us
writer
,
as
so
many
wealthy
squire
,
from
whom
we
,
the
poor
of
Parnassus
,
claim
an
immemorial
custom
of
take
whatever
we
can
come
at
.
<EOS>
this
liberty
I
demand
,
and
this
I
be
as
ready
to
allow
again
to
my
poor
neighbour
in
their
turn
.
<EOS>
all
I
profess
,
and
all
I
require
of
my
brother
,
be
to
maintain
the
same
strict
honesty
among
ourselves
which
the
mob
show
to
one
another
.
<EOS>
to
steal
from
one
another
be
indeed
highly
criminal
and
indecent
;
for
this
may
be
strictly
stile
defraud
the
poor
(
sometimes
perhaps
those
who
be
poor
than
ourselves
)
,
or
,
to
set
it
under
the
most
opprobrious
colour
,
rob
the
spittal
.
  
<EOS>
since
,
therefore
,
upon
the
strict
examination
,
my
own
conscience
can
not
lay
any
such
pitiful
theft
to
my
charge
,
I
be
content
to
plead
guilty
to
the
former
accusation
;
nor
shall
I
ever
scruple
to
take
to
myself
any
passage
which
I
shall
find
in
an
antient
author
to
my
purpose
,
without
set
down
the
name
of
the
author
from
whence
<EOS>
it
be
take
.
<EOS>
nay
,
I
absolutely
claim
a
property
in
all
such
sentiment
the
moment
they
be
transcribe
into
my
writing
,
and
I
expect
all
reader
henceforward
to
regard
them
as
purely
and
entirely
my
own
.
<EOS>
this
claim
,
however
,
I
desire
to
be
allow
me
only
on
condition
that
I
preserve
strict
honesty
towards
my
poor
brother
,
from
whom
,
if
ever
I
borrow
any
of
that
little
of
which
they
be
possess
,
I
shall
never
fail
to
put
their
mark
upon
it
,
that
it
may
be
at
all
time
ready
to
be
restore
to
the
right
owner
.
  
<EOS>
the
omission
of
this
be
highly
blameable
in
one
Mr
Moore
,
who
,
have
formerly
borrow
some
line
of
Pope
and
company
,
take
the
liberty
to
transcribe
six
of
them
into
his
play
of
the
rival
Modes
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pope
,
however
,
very
luckily
find
them
in
the
say
play
,
and
,
lay
violent
hand
on
his
own
property
,
transfer
it
back
again
into
his
own
work
;
and
,
for
a
further
punishment
,
imprison
the
say
Moore
in
the
loathsome
dungeon
of
the
Dunciad
,
where
his
unhappy
memory
now
remain
,
and
eternally
will
remain
,
as
a
proper
punishment
for
such
his
unjust
dealing
in
the
poetical
trade
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
,
though
the
squire
doth
not
find
his
daughter
,
something
be
find
which
put
an
end
to
his
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
the
history
now
return
to
the
inn
at
Upton
,
whence
<EOS>
we
shall
first
trace
the
footstep
of
Squire
Western
;
for
,
as
he
will
soon
arrive
at
an
end
of
his
journey
,
we
shall
have
then
full
leisure
to
attend
our
heroe
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
may
be
pleased
to
remember
that
the
say
squire
depart
from
the
inn
in
great
fury
,
and
in
that
fury
he
pursue
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
the
hostler
have
inform
him
that
she
have
cross
the
Severn
,
he
likewise
past
that
river
with
his
equipage
,
and
ride
full
speed
,
vow
the
utmost
vengeance
against
poor
Sophia
,
if
he
should
but
overtake
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
not
go
far
before
he
arrive
at
a
crossway
.
<EOS>
here
he
call
a
short
council
of
war
,
in
which
,
after
hear
different
opinion
,
he
at
last
give
the
direction
of
his
pursuit
to
fortune
,
and
strike
directly
into
the
Worcester
road
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
road
he
proceed
about
two
mile
,
when
he
begin
to
bemoan
himself
most
bitterly
,
frequently
cry
out
,
"
what
pity
be
it
!
<EOS>
sure
never
be
so
unlucky
a
dog
as
myself
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
burst
forth
a
volley
of
oath
and
execration
.
  
<EOS>
the
parson
attempt
to
administer
comfort
to
him
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
sorrow
not
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
like
those
without
hope
.
<EOS>
Howbeit
we
have
not
yet
be
able
to
overtake
young
madam
,
we
may
account
it
<EOS>
some
good
fortune
that
we
have
hitherto
trace
her
course
aright
.
<EOS>
peradventure
she
will
soon
be
fatigate
with
her
journey
,
and
will
tarry
in
some
inn
,
in
order
to
renovate
her
corporeal
function
;
and
in
that
case
,
in
all
moral
certainty
,
you
will
very
briefly
be
compos
voti
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Pogh
!
<EOS>
d####n
the
slut
!
<EOS>
"
answer
the
squire
,
"
I
be
lament
the
loss
of
so
fine
a
morning
for
hunting
.
<EOS>
It
be
confound
hard
to
lose
one
of
the
good
scenting
day
,
in
all
appearance
,
which
hath
be
this
season
,
and
especially
after
so
long
a
frost
.
"
  
<EOS>
whether
Fortune
,
who
now
and
then
show
some
compassion
in
her
wanton
trick
,
may
not
take
pity
of
the
squire
;
and
,
as
she
have
determine
not
to
let
him
overtake
his
daughter
,
may
not
resolve
to
make
him
amend
some
other
way
,
I
will
not
assert
;
but
he
have
hardly
utter
the
word
just
before
commemorate
,
and
two
or
three
oath
at
their
heel
,
when
a
pack
of
hound
begin
to
open
their
melodious
throat
at
a
small
distance
from
them
,
which
the
squire
's
horse
and
his
rider
both
perceiving
,
both
immediately
prick
up
their
ear
,
and
the
squire
,
cry
,
"
She
be
go
,
she
be
go
!
<EOS>
damn
me
if
she
be
not
go
!
"
<EOS>
instantly
clap
spur
to
the
beast
,
who
little
need
it
,
have
indeed
the
same
inclination
with
his
master
;
and
now
the
whole
company
,
cross
into
a
corn
-
field
,
ride
directly
towards
the
hound
,
with
much
hallowing
and
whooping
,
while
the
poor
parson
,
bless
himself
,
bring
up
the
rear
.
  
<EOS>
thus
fable
report
that
the
fair
Grimalkin
,
whom
Venus
,
at
the
desire
of
a
passionate
lover
,
convert
from
a
cat
into
a
fine
woman
,
no
sooner
perceive
a
mouse
than
,
mindful
of
her
former
sport
,
and
still
retain
her
pristine
nature
<EOS>
,
she
leap
from
the
bed
of
her
husband
to
pursue
the
little
animal
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
we
to
understand
by
this
?
<EOS>
not
that
the
bride
be
displease
with
the
embrace
of
her
amorous
bridegroom
;
for
,
though
some
have
remark
that
cat
be
subject
to
ingratitude
,
yet
woman
and
cat
too
will
be
pleased
and
purr
on
certain
occasion
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
as
the
sagacious
Sir
Roger
L'Estrange
observe
,
in
his
deep
reflection
,
that
,
"
if
we
shut
Nature
out
at
the
door
,
she
will
come
in
at
the
window
;
and
that
puss
,
though
a
madam
,
will
be
a
mouser
still
.
"
<EOS>
in
the
same
manner
we
be
not
to
arraign
the
squire
of
any
want
of
love
for
his
daughter
;
for
in
reality
he
have
a
great
deal
;
we
be
only
to
consider
that
he
be
a
squire
and
a
sportsman
,
and
then
we
may
apply
the
fable
to
him
,
and
the
judicious
reflection
likewise
.
  
<EOS>
the
hound
run
very
hard
,
as
it
be
call
,
and
the
squire
pursue
over
hedge
and
ditch
,
with
all
his
usual
vociferation
and
alacrity
,
and
with
all
his
usual
pleasure
;
nor
do
the
thought
of
Sophia
ever
once
intrude
themselves
to
allay
the
satisfaction
he
enjoy
in
the
chace
,
which
,
he
say
,
be
one
of
the
fine
he
ever
see
,
and
which
he
swear
be
very
well
worth
go
fifty
mile
for
.
<EOS>
as
the
squire
forget
his
daughter
,
the
servant
,
we
may
easily
believe
,
forget
their
mistress
;
and
the
parson
,
after
have
express
much
astonishment
,
in
Latin
,
to
himself
,
at
length
likewise
abandon
all
farth
thought
of
the
young
lady
,
and
,
jog
on
at
a
distance
behind
,
begin
to
meditate
a
portion
of
doctrine
for
the
ensue
Sunday
.
  
<EOS>
the
squire
who
own
the
hound
be
highly
pleased
with
the
arrival
of
his
brother
squire
and
sportsman
;
for
all
man
approve
merit
in
their
own
way
,
and
no
man
be
more
expert
in
the
field
than
Mr
Western
,
nor
do
any
other
better
know
how
to
encourage
the
dog
with
his
voice
,
and
to
animate
the
hunt
with
his
holla
.
  
<EOS>
Sportsmen
,
in
the
warmth
of
a
chace
,
be
too
much
engage
to
attend
to
any
manner
of
ceremony
,
nay
,
even
to
the
office
of
humanity
:
<EOS>
for
,
if
any
of
them
meet
with
an
accident
by
tumble
into
a
ditch
,
or
into
a
river
,
the
rest
pass
on
regardless
,
and
generally
leave
him
to
his
fate
:
during
this
time
,
therefore
,
the
two
squire
,
though
often
close
to
each
other
,
interchange
not
a
single
word
.
<EOS>
the
master
of
the
hunt
,
however
,
often
see
and
approve
the
great
judgment
of
the
stranger
in
draw
the
dog
when
they
be
at
a
fault
,
and
hence
conceive
a
very
high
opinion
of
his
understanding
,
as
the
number
of
his
attendant
inspire
no
small
reverence
to
his
quality
.
<EOS>
as
soon
,
therefore
,
as
the
sport
be
end
by
the
death
of
the
little
animal
which
have
occasion
it
,
the
two
squire
meet
,
and
in
all
squire
-
like
greeting
salute
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
the
conversation
be
entertain
enough
,
and
what
we
may
perhaps
relate
in
an
appendix
,
or
on
some
other
occasion
;
but
as
it
nowise
concern
this
history
,
we
can
not
prevail
on
ourselves
to
give
it
a
place
here
.
<EOS>
It
conclude
with
a
second
chace
,
and
that
with
an
invitation
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
this
be
accept
,
be
follow
by
a
hearty
bout
of
drinking
,
which
end
in
as
hearty
a
nap
on
the
part
of
Squire
Western
.
  
<EOS>
Our
squire
be
by
no
mean
a
match
either
for
his
host
,
or
for
parson
Supple
,
at
his
cup
that
evening
;
for
which
the
violent
fatigue
of
mind
as
well
as
body
that
he
have
undergo
,
may
very
well
account
,
without
the
least
derogation
from
his
honour
.
<EOS>
He
be
indeed
,
accord
to
the
vulgar
phrase
,
whistle
drunk
;
for
before
he
have
swallow
the
third
bottle
,
he
become
so
entirely
overpower
that
though
he
be
not
carry
off
to
bed
till
long
after
,
the
parson
consider
him
as
absent
,
and
have
acquaint
the
other
squire
with
all
relate
to
Sophia
,
he
obtain
his
promise
of
second
those
argument
which
he
intend
to
urge
the
next
morning
for
Mr
Western
's
return
.
  
<EOS>
no
sooner
,
therefore
,
have
the
good
squire
shake
off
his
evening
,
and
begin
to
call
for
his
morning
draught
,
and
to
summon
his
horse
in
order
to
renew
his
pursuit
,
than
Mr
Supple
begin
his
dissuasive
,
which
the
host
so
strongly
seconded
,
that
they
at
length
prevail
,
and
Mr
Western
agree
to
return
home
;
be
principally
move
by
one
argument
,
viz
.
,
that
he
know
not
which
way
to
go
,
and
may
probably
be
ride
farther
from
his
daughter
instead
of
towards
her
.
<EOS>
He
then
take
leave
of
his
brother
sportsman
,
and
express
great
joy
that
the
frost
be
break
(
which
may
perhaps
be
no
small
motive
to
his
hasten
home
)
,
set
forwards
,
or
rather
backwards
,
for
Somersetshire
;
but
not
before
he
have
first
despatch
part
of
his
retinue
in
quest
of
his
daughter
,
after
whom
he
likewise
send
a
volley
of
the
most
bitter
execration
which
he
could
invent
.
    
<EOS>
the
departure
of
Jones
from
Upton
,
with
what
pass
between
him
and
Partridge
on
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
we
be
once
more
come
to
our
heroe
;
and
,
to
say
truth
,
we
have
be
oblige
to
part
with
him
so
long
,
that
,
consider
the
condition
in
which
we
leave
him
,
I
apprehend
many
of
our
reader
have
conclude
we
intend
to
abandon
him
for
ever
;
he
be
at
present
in
that
situation
in
which
prudent
people
usually
desist
from
enquire
any
farther
after
their
friend
,
lest
they
should
be
shock
by
hear
such
friend
have
hang
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
in
reality
,
if
we
have
not
all
the
virtue
,
I
will
boldly
say
,
neither
have
we
all
the
vice
of
a
prudent
character
;
and
though
it
be
not
easy
to
conceive
circumstance
much
more
miserable
than
those
of
poor
Jones
at
present
,
we
shall
return
to
him
,
and
attend
upon
him
with
the
same
diligence
as
if
he
be
wanton
in
the
bright
beam
of
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Jones
,
then
,
and
his
companion
Partridge
,
leave
the
inn
a
few
minute
after
the
departure
of
Squire
Western
,
and
pursue
the
same
road
on
foot
,
for
the
hostler
tell
them
that
no
horse
be
by
any
mean
to
be
at
that
time
procure
at
Upton
.
<EOS>
on
they
march
with
heavy
heart
;
for
though
their
disquiet
proceed
from
very
different
reason
,
yet
displeased
they
be
both
;
and
if
Jones
sigh
bitterly
,
Partridge
grunt
altogether
as
sadly
at
every
step
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
come
to
the
cross
-
road
where
the
squire
have
stopt
to
take
counsel
,
Jones
stopt
likewise
,
and
turn
to
Partridge
,
ask
his
opinion
which
track
they
should
pursue
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
sir
,
"
answer
Partridge
,
"
I
wish
your
honour
would
follow
my
advice
.
"
<EOS>
"
why
should
I
not
?
"
<EOS>
reply
Jones
;
"
for
it
be
now
indifferent
to
me
whither
<EOS>
I
go
,
or
what
become
of
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
My
advice
,
then
,
"
say
Partridge
,
"
be
,
that
you
immediately
face
about
and
return
home
;
for
who
that
hath
such
a
home
to
return
to
as
your
honour
,
would
travel
thus
about
the
country
like
a
vagabond
?
<EOS>
I
ask
pardon
,
sed
vox
ea
sola
reperta
est
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
alas
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Jones
,
"
<EOS>
I
have
no
home
to
return
to
;
 
but
if
my
friend
,
my
father
,
would
receive
me
,
could
I
bear
the
country
from
which
Sophia
be
fly
?
<EOS>
Cruel
Sophia
!
<EOS>
Cruel
!
<EOS>
no
;
let
me
blame
myself
!
 
<EOS>
no
;
let
me
blame
thee
.
<EOS>
d
 
nation
seize
thee
 
fool
 
blockhead
!
<EOS>
thou
hast
undo
me
,
and
I
will
tear
thy
soul
from
thy
body
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
which
word
he
lay
violent
hand
on
the
collar
of
poor
Partridge
,
and
shake
him
more
heartily
than
an
ague
-
fit
,
or
his
own
fear
have
ever
do
before
.
  
<EOS>
Partridge
fall
tremble
on
his
knee
,
and
beg
for
mercy
,
vow
he
have
mean
no
harm
 
when
Jones
,
after
stare
wildly
on
him
for
a
moment
,
quit
his
hold
,
and
discharge
a
rage
on
himself
,
that
,
have
it
fall
on
the
other
,
would
certainly
have
put
an
end
to
his
being
,
which
indeed
the
very
apprehension
of
it
have
almost
effect
.
  
<EOS>
We
would
bestow
some
pain
here
in
minutely
describe
all
the
mad
prank
which
Jones
play
on
this
occasion
,
could
we
be
well
assure
that
the
reader
would
take
the
same
pain
in
peruse
them
;
but
as
we
be
apprehensive
that
,
after
all
the
labour
which
we
should
employ
in
paint
this
scene
,
the
say
reader
would
be
very
apt
to
skip
it
entirely
over
,
we
have
save
ourselves
that
trouble
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
we
have
,
from
this
reason
alone
,
often
do
great
violence
to
the
luxuriance
of
our
genius
,
and
have
leave
many
excellent
description
out
of
our
work
,
which
would
otherwise
have
be
in
it
.
<EOS>
and
this
suspicion
,
to
be
honest
,
arise
,
as
be
generally
the
case
,
from
our
own
wicked
heart
;
for
we
have
,
ourselves
,
be
very
often
most
horridly
give
to
jump
,
as
we
have
run
through
the
page
of
voluminous
historian
.
  
<EOS>
suffice
<EOS>
it
then
simply
to
say
,
that
Jones
,
after
have
play
the
part
of
a
madman
for
many
minute
,
come
,
by
degree
,
to
himself
;
which
no
sooner
happen
,
than
,
turn
to
Partridge
,
he
very
earnestly
beg
his
pardon
for
the
attack
he
have
make
on
him
in
the
violence
of
his
passion
;
but
conclude
,
by
desire
him
never
to
mention
his
return
again
;
for
he
be
resolve
never
to
see
that
country
any
more
.
  
<EOS>
Partridge
easily
forgave
,
and
faithfully
promise
to
obey
the
injunction
now
lay
upon
him
.
<EOS>
and
then
Jones
very
briskly
cry
out
,
"
since
it
be
absolutely
impossible
for
me
to
pursue
any
farther
the
step
of
my
angel
 
I
will
pursue
those
of
glory
.
<EOS>
come
on
,
my
brave
lad
,
now
for
the
army
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
glorious
cause
,
and
I
would
willingly
sacrifice
my
life
in
it
,
even
though
it
be
worth
my
preserving
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
say
,
he
immediately
strike
into
the
different
road
from
that
which
the
squire
have
take
,
and
,
by
mere
chance
,
pursue
the
very
same
through
which
Sophia
have
before
pass
.
  
<EOS>
Our
traveller
now
march
a
full
mile
,
without
speak
a
syllable
to
each
other
,
though
Jones
,
indeed
,
mutter
many
thing
to
himself
.
<EOS>
as
to
Partridge
,
he
be
profoundly
silent
;
for
he
be
not
,
perhaps
,
perfectly
recover
from
his
former
fright
;
besides
,
he
have
apprehension
of
provoke
his
friend
to
a
second
fit
of
wrath
,
especially
as
he
now
begin
to
entertain
a
conceit
,
which
may
not
,
perhaps
,
create
any
great
wonder
in
the
reader
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
begin
now
to
suspect
that
Jones
be
absolutely
out
of
his
sense
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
,
Jones
,
be
weary
of
soliloquy
,
address
himself
to
his
companion
,
and
blame
him
for
his
taciturnity
;
for
which
the
poor
man
very
honestly
account
,
from
his
fear
of
give
offence
.
<EOS>
and
now
this
fear
be
pretty
well
remove
,
by
the
most
absolute
promise
of
indemnity
<EOS>
,
Partridge
again
take
the
bridle
from
his
tongue
;
which
,
perhaps
,
rejoice
no
less
at
regain
its
liberty
,
than
a
young
colt
,
when
the
bridle
be
slipt
from
his
neck
,
and
he
be
turn
loose
into
the
pasture
.
  
<EOS>
as
Partridge
be
inhibit
from
that
topic
which
would
have
first
suggest
itself
,
he
fall
upon
that
which
be
next
uppermost
in
his
mind
,
namely
,
the
Man
of
the
Hill
.
"
<EOS>
certainly
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
could
never
be
a
man
,
who
dress
himself
and
live
after
such
a
strange
manner
,
and
so
unlike
other
folk
.
<EOS>
besides
,
his
diet
,
as
the
old
woman
tell
me
,
be
chiefly
upon
herb
,
which
be
a
fitter
food
for
a
horse
than
a
Christian
:
nay
,
landlord
at
Upton
say
that
the
neighbour
thereabout
have
very
fearful
notion
about
him
.
<EOS>
It
run
strangely
in
my
head
that
it
must
have
be
some
spirit
,
who
,
perhaps
,
may
be
send
to
forewarn
us
:
and
who
know
but
all
that
matter
which
he
tell
us
,
of
his
go
to
fight
,
and
of
his
be
take
prisoner
,
and
of
the
great
danger
he
be
in
of
be
hang
,
may
be
intend
as
a
warning
to
us
,
consider
what
we
be
go
about
?
<EOS>
besides
,
I
dreamt
of
nothing
all
last
night
but
of
fighting
;
and
methought
the
blood
run
out
of
my
nose
,
as
liquor
out
of
a
tap
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
sir
,
infandum

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thy
story

Partridge
,

answer
Jones
,
"
be
almost
as
ill
apply
as
thy
Latin
.
<EOS>
nothing
can
be
more
likely
to
happen
than
death
to
man
who
go
into
battle
.
<EOS>
perhaps
we
shall
both
fall
in
it
 
and
what
then
?
"
<EOS>
"
what
then
?
"
reply
Partridge
;
"
why
then
there
be
an
end
of
us
,
be
there
not
?
<EOS>
when
I
be
go
,
all
be
over
with
me

<EOS>
what
matter
the
cause
to
me
,
or
who
get
the
victory
,
if
I
be
kill
?
<EOS>
I
shall
never
enjoy
any
advantage
from
it
.
<EOS>
what
be
all
the
ringing
of
bell
,
and
bonfire
,
to
one
that
be
six
foot
under
ground
?
<EOS>
there
will
be
an
end
of
poor
Partridge
.
"
<EOS>
"
and
an
end
of
poor
Partridge
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
there
must
be
,
one
time
or
other
.
<EOS>
if
you
love
Latin
,
I
will
repeat
you
some
fine
line
out
of
Horace
,
which
would
inspire
courage
into
a
coward
.

"
I
wish
you
would
construe
them
,
"
cry
Partridge
;
"
for
Horace
be
a
hard
author

I
can
not
understand

you

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
repeat
you
a
bad
imitation
,
or
rather
paraphrase
,
of
my
own
,
"
say
Jones
;
"
for
I
be

an
indifferent
poet

"
who

that

very
certain

Partridge

"
<EOS>
ay

there
be
a
great

hence

with
all
our

be
shoot

I
never

I
could
hardly
bring
myself
ever
to
look
upon

there
be
nothing

cursing

among

I

I

would

I

that
.
<EOS>
why
,
I
be
a
middle
-
aged
man
now
,
and
yet
I
may
live
a
great
number
of
year
.
<EOS>
I
have
read
of
several
who
have
live
to
be
above
a
hundred
,
and
some
a
great
deal
above
a
hundred
.
<EOS>
not
that
I
hope
,
I
mean
that
I
promise
myself
,
to
live
to
any
such
age
as
that
,
neither
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
it
be
only
to
eighty
or
ninety
.
<EOS>
Heaven
be
praise
,
that
be
a
great
way
off
yet
;
and
I
be
not
afraid
of
die
then
,
no
more
than
another
man
;
but
,
surely
,
to
tempt
death
before
a
man
's
time
<EOS>
be
come
seem
to
me
downright
wickedness
and
presumption
.
<EOS>
besides
,
if
it
be
to
do
any
good
indeed
;
but
,
let
the
cause
be
what
it
will
,
what
mighty
matter
of
good
can
two
people
do
?
<EOS>
and
,
for
my
part
,
I
understand
nothing
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
never
fire
off
a
gun
above
ten
time
in
my
life
;
and
then
it
be
not
charge
with
bullet
.
<EOS>
and
for
the
sword
,
I
never
learn
to
fence
,
and
know
nothing
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
and
then
there
be
those
cannon
,
which
certainly
it
must
be
think
the
high
presumption
to
go
in
the
way
of
;
and
nobody
but
a
madman
 
<EOS>
I
ask
pardon
;
upon
my
soul
I
mean
no
harm
;
I
beg
I
may
not
throw
your
honour
into
another
passion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
under
no
apprehension

Partridge
,
"
cry
Jones
;
"
I
be
now
so
well
convinced
of
thy
cowardice
,
that
thou
couldst
not
provoke
me
on
any
account
.
"
<EOS>
"
Your
honour
,
"
answer
he
,
"
may
call
me
coward
,
or
anything
else
you
please

<EOS>
if
love
to
sleep
in
a
whole

make
a
man
a
coward
,
non
immune
ab
illis

<EOS>
I
never
read
in
my
grammar
that
a
man
can
not
be
a
good
man
without
fight
.
<EOS>
Vir
bonus
est
quis
?
<EOS>
Qui
consulta
patrum
,
qui
lege
juraque
servat
.
<EOS>
not
a
word
of
fighting
;
and
I
be
sure
the
scripture
be
so
much
against
it
,
that
a
man
shall
never
persuade
me
he
be
a
good
christian
while
he
shed
christian
blood
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
adventure
of
a
beggar
-
man
.
 
<EOS>
just
as
Partridge
have
utter
that
good
and
pious
doctrine
,
with
which
the
last
chapter
conclude
,
they
arrive
at
another
cross
-
way
,
when
a
lame
fellow
in
rag
ask
them
for
alm
;
upon
which
Partridge
give
him
a
severe
rebuke
,
say
,
"
every
parish
ought
to
keep
their
own
poor
.
"
<EOS>
Jones
then
fall
a
-
laughing
,
and
ask
Partridge
,
"
if
he
be
not
ashamed
,
with
so
much
charity
in
his
mouth
,
to
have
no
charity
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
Your
religion
,
"
say
he
,
"
serve
you
only
for
an
excuse
for
your
fault
,
but
be
no
incentive
to
your
virtue
.
<EOS>
Can
any
man
who
be
really
a
christian
abstain
from
relieve
one
of
his
brother
in
such
a
miserable
condition
?
"
<EOS>
and
at
the
same
time
,
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
he
give
the
poor
object
a
shilling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Master
,
"
cry
the
fellow
,
after
thank
him
,
"
I
have
a
curious
thing
here
in
my
pocket
,
which
I
find
about
two
mile
off
,
if
your
worship
will
please
to
buy
it
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
venture
to
pull
it
out
to
every
one
;
but
,
as
you
be
so
good
a
gentleman
,
and
so
kind
to
the
poor
,
you
will
not
suspect
a
man
of
be
a
thief
only
because
he
be
poor
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
pull
out
a
little
gilt
pocket
-
book
,
and
deliver
it
into
the
hand
of
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
presently
open
it
,
and
(
guess
,
reader
<EOS>
,
what
he
feel
)
see
in
the
first
page
the
word
Sophia
Western
,
write
by
her
own
fair
hand
.
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
read
the
name
than
he
prest
it
close
to
his
lip
;
nor
could
he
avoid
fall
into
some
very
frantic
rapture
,
notwithstanding
his
company
;
but
,
perhaps
,
these
very
rapture
make
him
forget
he
be
not
alone
.
  
<EOS>
while
Jones
be
kiss
and
mumble
the
book
,
as
if
he
have
an
excellent
brown
butter
crust
in
his
mouth
or
as
if
he
have
really
be
a
book
-
worm
,
or
an
author
who
have
nothing
to
eat
but
his
own
work
,
a
piece
of
paper
fall
from
its
leave
to
the
ground
,
which
Partridge
take
up
,
and
deliver
to
Jones
,
who
presently
perceive
it
to
be
a
bank
-
bill
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
indeed
,
the
very
bill
which
Western
have
give
his
daughter
the
night
before
her
departure
;
and
a
Jew
would
have
jump
to
purchase
it
at
five
shilling
less
than
L100
.
  
<EOS>
the
eye
of
Partridge
sparkle
at
this
news
,
which
Jones
now
proclaim
aloud
;
and
so
do
(
though
with
somewhat
a
different
aspect
)
<EOS>
those
of
the
poor
fellow
who
have
find
the
book
;
and
who
(
I
hope
from
a
principle
of
honesty
)
have
never
open
it
:
but
we
should
not
deal
honestly
by
the
reader
if
we
omit
to
inform
him
of
a
circumstance
which
may
be
here
a
little
material
,
viz
.
<EOS>
that
the
fellow
could
not
read
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
,
who
have
feel
nothing
but
pure
joy
and
transport
from
the
finding
the
book
,
be
affect
with
a
mixture
of
concern
at
this
new
discovery
;
for
his
imagination
instantly
suggest
to
him
that
the
owner
of
the
bill
may
possibly
want
it
before
he
should
be
able
to
convey
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
then
acquaint
the
finder
that
he
know
the
lady
to
whom
the
book
belong
,
and
would
endeavour
to
find
her
out
as
soon
as
possible
,
and
return
it
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
pocket
-
book
be
a
late
present
from
Mrs
Western
to
her
niece
;
it
have
cost
five
-
and
-
twenty
shilling
,
have
be
buy
of
a
celebrated
toyman
;
but
the
real
value
of
the
silver
which
it
contain
in
its
clasp
be
about
eighteen
-
penny
;
and
that
price
the
say
toyman
,
<EOS>
as
it
be
altogether
as
good
as
when
it
first
issue
from
his
shop
,
would
now
have
give
for
it
.
<EOS>
a
prudent
person
would
,
however
,
have
take
proper
advantage
of
the
ignorance
of
this
fellow
,
and
would
not
have
offer
more
than
a
shilling
,
or
perhaps
sixpence
,
for
it
;
nay
,
some
perhaps
would
have
give
nothing
,
and
leave
the
fellow
to
his
action
of
trover
,
which
some
learn
serjeant
may
doubt
whether
he
could
,
under
these
circumstance
,
have
maintain
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
,
on
the
contrary
,
whose
character
be
on
the
outside
of
generosity
,
and
may
perhaps
not
very
unjustly
have
be
suspect
of
extravagance
,
without
any
hesitation
give
a
guinea
in
exchange
for
the
book
.
<EOS>
the
poor
man
,
who
have
not
for
a
long
time
before
be
possess
of
so
much
treasure
,
give
Mr
Jones
a
thousand
thank
,
and
discover
little
less
of
transport
in
his
muscle
than
Jones
have
before
show
when
he
have
first
read
the
name
of
Sophia
Western
.
  
<EOS>
the
fellow
very
readily
agree
to
attend
our
traveller
to
the
place
where
he
have
find
the
pocket
-
book
.
<EOS>
together
,
therefore
,
they
proceed
directly
thith
;
but
not
so
fast
as
Mr
Jones
desire
;
for
his
guide
unfortunately
happen
to
be
lame
,
and
could
not
possibly
travel
faster
than
a
mile
an
hour
.
<EOS>
as
this
place
,
therefore
,
be
at
above
three
mile
'
distance
,
though
the
fellow
have
say
otherwise
,
the
reader
nee
not
be
acquaint
how
long
they
be
in
walk
it
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
open
the
book
a
hundred
time
during
their
walk
,
kiss
it
as
often
,
talk
much
to
himself
,
and
very
little
to
his
companion
.
<EOS>
at
all
which
the
guide
expr
some
sign
of
astonishment
to
Partridge
;
who
more
than
once
shake
his
head
,
and
cry
,
Poor
gentleman
!
<EOS>
orandum
est
<EOS>
ut
sit
mens
<EOS>
sana
in
corpore
sano
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
they
arrive
at
the
very
spot
where
Sophia
unhappily
dropt
the
pocket
-
book
,
and
where
the
fellow
have
as
happily
find
it
.
<EOS>
here
Jones
offer
to
take
leave
of
his
guide
,
and
to
improve
his
pace
;
but
the
fellow
,
in
whom
that
violent
surprize
and
joy
which
the
first
receipt
of
the
guinea
have
occasion
be
now
considerably
abate
,
and
who
have
now
have
sufficient
time
to
recollect
himself
,
put
on
a
discontent
look
,
and
,
scratch
his
head
,
say
,
"
He
hope
his
worship
would
give
him
something
more
.
<EOS>
Your
worship
,
"
say
he
,
"
will
,
I
hope
,
take
it
into
your
consideration
that
if
I
have
not
be
honest
I
may
have
keep
the
whole
.
"
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
this
the
reader
must
confess
to
have
be
true
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
if
the
paper
there
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
worth
L100
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
the
finding
it
deserve
more
than
a
guinea
.
<EOS>
besides
,
suppose
your
worship
should
never
see
the
lady
,
nor
give
it
her
 
<EOS>
and
,
though
your
worship
look
and
talk
very
much
like
a
gentleman
,
yet
I
have
only
your
worship
's
bare
word
;
and
,
certainly
,
if
the
right
owner
ben't
to
be
find
,
it
all
belong
to
the
first
finder
.
<EOS>
I
hope
your
worship
will
consider
of
all
these
matter
:
I
be
but
a
poor
man
,
and
therefore
do
not
desire
to
have
all
;
but
it
be
but
reasonable
I
should
have
my
share
.
<EOS>
Your
worship
look
like
a
good
man
,
and
,
I
hope
,
will
consider
my
honesty
;
for
I
may
have
keep
every
farthing
,
and
nobody
ever
the
wiser
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
promise
thee
,
upon
my
honour
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
that
I
know
the
right
owner
,
and
will
restore
it
her

"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
your
worship

"
answer
the
fellow
,
"
may
do
as
you
please
as
to
that

if
you

but
give
me
my
share

one
-
half
of
the
money

your
honour
may
keep
the
rest
yourself
if
you
please
;
"
and
conclude
with
swearing
,
by
a
very
vehement
oath
,
"
that
he
would
never
mention
a
syllable
of
it
to
any
man
live

Lookee

cry
Jones
,
"
the

shall
certainly
have
again
all

as
for
any

gratuity

I
really
can
not
give
it
you
at

let
me
know
your

where
you

it

<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know

you

cry
the

;

it
seem
I
must
venture
whether
you
will
return
the

her
money

no

I

will
consider

"
come

come

"
say
Partridge
,
"
tell
his

your

"
<EOS>
the
fellow
,
see
no
hope
of
recover
the
possession
of
the
pocket

book
,
at
last
complied
in
give
in
his
name
and
place
of
abode
,
which
Jones
writ
upon
a
piece
of
paper
with
the
pencil
of
Sophia
;
and
then
,
place
the
paper
in
the
same
page
where
she
have
writ
her
name
,
he
cry
out
,
"
there

you
be
the
happy

alive

I
have
join
your

<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
anything
about
angel

"
answer
the
fellow
;

but
I
wish
you
would
give
me
a
little
more
money

else
return
me

"
<EOS>
Partridge
now
wax
wrath
:
he
call
the
poor
cripple
by
several
vile
and
opprobrious
name
,
and
be
absolutely
proceed
to
beat
him
,
but
Jones
would
not
suffer
any
such
thing
:
and
now
,
tell
the
fellow
he
would
certainly
find
some
opportunity
of
serve
him
,
Mr
Jones
depart
as
fast
as
his
heel
would
carry
him
;
and
Partridge
,
into
whom
the
thought
of
the
hundred
pound
have
infuse
new
spirit
,
follow
his
leader
;
while
the
man
,
who
be
oblige
to
stay
behind
,
fall
to
curse
them
both
,
as
well
as
his
parent
;
"
for
have
they
,
"
say
he
,
"
send
me
to
charity
-
school
to
learn
to
write
and
read
and
cast
account
,
I
should
have
know
the
value
of
these
matter
as
well
as
other
people
.
"
    
<EOS>
contain
more
adventure
which
Mr
Jones
and
his
companion
meet
on
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
Our
traveller
now
walk
so
fast
,
that
they
have
very
little
time
or
breath
for
conversation
;
Jones
meditate
all
the
way
on
Sophia
,
and
Partridge
on
the
bank
-
bill
,
which
,
though
it
give
him
some
pleasure
,
cause
him
at
the
same
time
to
repine
at
fortune
,
which
,
in
all
his
walk
,
have
never
give
him
such
an
opportunity
of
show
his
honesty
.
<EOS>
They
have
proceed
above
three
mile
,
when
Partridge
,
be
unable
any
longer
to
keep
up
with
Jones
,
call
to
him
,
and
beg
him
a
little
to
slacken
his
pace
:
with
this
he
be
the
more
ready
to
comply
,
as
he
have
for
some
time
lose
the
footstep
of
the
horse
,
which
the
thaw
have
enable
him
to
trace
for
several
mile
,
and
he
be
now
upon
a
wide
common
,
where
be
several
road
.
  
<EOS>
He
here
therefore
stopt
to
consider
which
of
these
road
he
should
pursue
;
when
on
a
sudden
they
hear
the
noise
of
a
drum
,
that
seem
at
no
great
distance
.
<EOS>
this
sound
presently
alarm
the
fear
of
Partridge
,
and
he
cry
out
,
<EOS>
"
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
all
;
they
be
certainly
a
come
!
"
<EOS>
"
who
be
come
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Jones
;
for
fear
have
long
since
give
place
to
soft
idea
in
his
mind
;
and
since
his
adventure
with
the
lame
man
,
he
have
be
totally
intent
on
pursue
Sophia
,
without
entertain
one
thought
of
an
enemy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
who
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Partridge
,
"
why
,
the
rebel
:
<EOS>
but
why
should
I
call
them
rebel
?
<EOS>
they
may
be
very
honest
gentleman
,
for
anything
I
know
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
the
devil
take
him
that
affront
them
,
I
say
;
I
be
sure
,
if
they
have
nothing
to
say
to
me
,
I
will
have
nothing
to
say
to
them
,
but
in
a
civil
way
.
<EOS>
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
sir
,
do
not
affront
them
if
they
should
come
,
and
perhaps
they
may
do
us
no
harm
;
but
would
it
not
be
the
wise
way
to
creep
into
some
of
yonder
bush
,
till
they
be
go
by
?
<EOS>
what
can
two
unarmed
man
do
perhaps
against
fifty
thousand
?
<EOS>
certainly
nobody
but
a
madman
<EOS>
;
I
hope
your
honour
be
not
offend
;
but
certainly
no
man
who
hath
mens
sana
in
corpore
sano
"
<EOS>
here
Jones
interrupt
this
torrent
of
eloquence
,
which
fear
have
inspire
,
say
,
"
that
by
the
drum
he
perceive
they
be
near
some
town
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
make
directly
towards
the
place
whence
the
noise
proceed
,
bid
Partridge
"
take
courage
,
for
that
he
would
lead
him
into
no
danger
;
"
and
add
,
"
it
be
impossible
the
rebel
should
be
so
near
.
"
  
<EOS>
Partridge
be
a
little
comfort
with
this
last
assurance
;
and
though
he
would
more
gladly
have
go
the
contrary
way
,
he
follow
his
leader
,
his
heart
beat
time
,
but
not
after
the
manner
of
hero
,
to
the
music
of
the
drum
,
which
cease
not
till
they
have
traverse
the
common
,
and
be
come
into
a
narrow
lane
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
Partridge
,
who
keep
even
pace
with
Jones
,
discover
something
paint
fly
in
the
air
,
a
very
few
yard
before
him
,
which
fancy
to
be
the
colour
of
the
enemy
,
he
fall
a
bellowing
,
"
<EOS>
oh
Lord
,
sir
,
here
they
be
;
there
be
the
crown
and
coffin
.
<EOS>
oh
Lord
!
<EOS>
I
never
see
anything
so
terrible
;
and
we
be
within
gun
-
shot
of
them
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
no
sooner
look
up
,
than
he
plainly
perceive
what
it
be
which
Partridge
have
thus
mistake
.
"
<EOS>
partridge
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
fancy
you
will
be
able
to
engage
this
whole
army
yourself
;
for
by
the
colour
I
guess
what
the
drum
be
which
we
hear
before
,
and
which
beat
up
for
recruit
to
a
puppet
-
show
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
puppet
-
show
!
"
answer
Partridge
,
with
most
eager
transport
.
"
<EOS>
and
be
it
really
no
more
than
that
?
<EOS>
I
love
a
puppet
-
show
of
all
the
pastime
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
do
,
good
sir
,
let
us
tarry
and
see
it
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
be
quite
famished
to
death
;
for
it
be
now
almost
dark
,
and
I
have
not
eat
a
morsel
since
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
now
arrive
at
an
inn
,
or
indeed
an
ale
-
house
,
where
Jones
be
prevail
upon
to
stop
,
the
rather
as
he
have
no
longer
any
assurance
of
be
in
the
road
he
desire
.
<EOS>
They
walk
both
directly
into
the
kitchen
,
where
Jones
begin
to
enquire
if
no
lady
have
pass
that
way
in
the
morning
,
and
Partridge
as
eagerly
examine
into
the
state
of
their
provision
;
and
indeed
his
enquiry
meet
with
the
well
success
;
for
Jones
could
not
hear
news
of
Sophia
;
but
Partridge
,
to
his
great
satisfaction
,
find
good
reason
to
expect
very
shortly
the
agreeable
sight
of
an
excellent
smoaking
dish
of
egg
and
bacon
.
  
<EOS>
in
strong
and
healthy
constitution
love
hath
a
very
different
effect
from
what
it
cause
in
the
puny
part
of
the
specie
.
<EOS>
in
the
latter
it
generally
destroy
all
that
appetite
which
tend
towards
the
conservation
of
the
individual
;
but
in
the
former
,
though
it
often
induce
forgetfulness
,
and
a
neglect
of
food
,
as
well
as
of
everything
else
;
yet
place
a
good
piece
of
well
-
powder
buttock
before
a
hungry
lover
,
and
he
seldom
fail
very
handsomely
to
play
his
part
.
<EOS>
thus
it
happen
in
the
present
case
;
for
though
Jones
perhaps
want
a
prompter
,
and
may
have
travel
much
farther
,
have
he
be
alone
,
with
an
empty
stomach
;
yet
no
sooner
do
he
sit
down
to
the
bacon
and
egg
,
than
he
fall
to
as
heartily
and
voraciously
as
Partridge
himself
.
  
<EOS>
before
our
traveller
have
finish
their
dinner
,
night
come
on
,
and
as
the
moon
be
now
past
the
full
,
it
be
extremely
dark
.
<EOS>
partridge
therefore
prevail
on
Jones
to
stay
and
see
the
puppet
-
show
,
which
be
just
go
to
begin
,
and
to
which
they
be
very
eagerly
invite
by
the
master
of
the
say
show
,
who
declare
that
his
figure
be
the
fine
which
the
world
have
ever
produce
,
and
that
they
have
give
great
satisfaction
to
all
the
quality
in
every
town
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
the
puppet
-
show
be
perform
with
great
regularity
and
decency
.
<EOS>
It
be
call
the
fine
and
serious
part
of
the
Provoked
Husband
;
and
it
be
indeed
a
very
grave
and
solemn
entertainment
,
without
any
low
wit
or
humour
,
or
jest
;
or
,
to
do
it
no
more
than
justice
,
without
anything
which
could
provoke
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
the
audience
be
all
highly
pleased
.
<EOS>
a
grave
matron
tell
the
master
she
would
bring
her
two
daughter
the
next
night
,
as
he
do
not
show
any
stuff
;
and
an
attorney
's
clerk
and
an
exciseman
both
declare
,
that
the
character
of
Lord
and
Lady
Townley
be
well
preserve
,
and
highly
in
nature
.
<EOS>
partridge
likewise
concur
with
this
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
the
master
be
so
highly
elated
with
these
encomium
,
that
he
could
not
refrain
from
add
some
more
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
the
present
age
be
not
improve
in
anything
so
much
as
in
their
puppet
-
show
;
which
,
by
throw
out
Punch
and
his
wife
Joan
,
and
such
idle
trumpery
,
be
at
last
bring
to
be
a
rational
entertainment
.
<EOS>
I
remember
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
when
I
first
take
to
the
business
,
there
be
a
great
deal
of
low
stuff
that
do
very
well
to
make
folk
laugh
;
but
be
never
calculate
to
improve
the
moral
of
young
people
,
which
certainly
ought
to
be
principally
aim
at
in
every
puppet
-
show
:
<EOS>
for
why
may
not
good
and
instructive
lesson
be
convey
this
way
,
as
well
as
any
other
?
<EOS>
My
figure
be
as
big
as
the
life
,
and
they
represent
the
life
in
every
particular
;
and
I
question
not
but
people
rise
from
my
little
drama
as
much
improve
as
they
do
from
the
great
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
would
by
no
means
degrade
the
ingenuity
of
your
profession
,
"
answer
Jones
,
"
but
I
should
have
be
glad
to
have
see
my
old
acquaintance
master
Punch
,
for
all
that
;
and
so
far
from
improve
,
I
think
,
by
leave
out
him
and
his
merry
wife
Joan
,
you
have
spoil
your
puppet
-
show
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
dancer
of
wire
conceive
an
immediate
and
high
contempt
for
Jones
,
from
these
word
.
<EOS>
and
with
much
disdain
in
his
countenance
,
he
reply
,
"
very
probably
,
sir
,
that
may
be
your
opinion
;
but
I
have
the
satisfaction
to
know
the
good
judge
differ
from
you
,
and
it
be
impossible
to
please
every
taste
.
<EOS>
I
confess
,
indeed
,
some
of
the
quality
at
Bath
,
two
or
three
year
ago
,
want
mightily
to
bring
Punch
again
upon
the
stage
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
lose
some
money
for
not
agree
to
it
;
but
let
other
do
as
they
will
;
a
little
matter
shall
never
bribe
me
to
degrade
my
own
profession
,
nor
will
I
ever
willingly
consent
to
the
spoil
the
decency
and
regularity
of
my
stage
,
by
introduce
any
such
low
stuff
upon
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
right
,
friend
,
"
cry
the
clerk
,
"
you
be
very
right
.
<EOS>
always
avoid
what
be
low
.
<EOS>
there
be
several
of
my
acquaintance
in
London
,
who
be
resolve
to
drive
everything
which
be
low
from
the
stage
.
"
<EOS>
"
nothing
can
be
more
proper
,
"
cry
the
exciseman
,
pull
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
"
I
remember
,
"
add
he
,
"
(
for
I
then
live
with
my
lord
)
<EOS>
I
be
in
the
footman
's
gallery
,
the
night
when
this
play
of
the
Provoked
Husband
be
act
first
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
deal
of
low
stuff
in
it
about
a
country
gentleman
come
up
to
town
to
stand
for
parliament
-
man
;
and
there
they
bring
a
parcel
of
his
servant
upon
the
stage
,
his
coachman
I
remember
particularly
;
but
the
gentleman
in
our
gallery
could
not
bear
anything
so
low
,
and
they
damn
it
.
<EOS>
I
observe
,
friend
,
you
have
leave
all
that
matter
out
,
and
you
be
to
be
commend
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
gentleman
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
I
can
never
maintain
my
opinion
against
so
many
;
indeed
,
if
the
generality
of
his
audience
dislike
him
,
the
learn
gentleman
who
conduct
the
show
may
have
do
very
right
in
dismiss
Punch
from
his
service
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
master
of
the
show
then
begin
a
second
harangue
,
and
say
much
of
the
great
force
of
example
,
and
how
much
the
inferior
part
of
mankind
would
be
deter
from
vice
,
by
observe
how
odious
it
be
in
their
superior
;
when
he
be
unluckily
interrupt
by
an
incident
,
which
,
though
perhaps
we
may
have
omit
it
at
another
time
,
we
can
not
help
relate
at
present
,
but
not
in
this
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
from
which
it
may
be
infer
that
the
good
thing
be
liable
to
be
misunderstood
and
misinterpret
.
 
<EOS>
a
violent
uproar
now
arise
in
the
entry
,
where
my
landlady
be
well
cuff
her
maid
both
with
her
fist
and
tongue
.
<EOS>
She
have
indeed
miss
the
wench
from
her
employment
,
and
,
after
a
little
search
,
have
find
her
on
the
puppet
-
show
stage
in
company
with
the
Merry
Andrew
,
and
in
a
situation
not
very
proper
to
be
describe
.
  
<EOS>
though
grace
(
for
that
be
her
name
)
have
forfeit
all
title
to
modesty
;
yet
have
she
not
impudence
enough
to
deny
a
fact
in
which
she
be
actually
surprize
;
she
,
therefore
,
take
another
turn
,
and
attempt
to
mitigate
the
offence
.
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
beat
me
in
this
manner
,
mistress
?
<EOS>
"
cry
the
wench
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
do
not
like
my
doing
,
you
may
turn
me
away
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
a
w####e
"
(
for
the
other
have
liberally
bestow
that
appellation
on
her
)
,
"
my
better
be
so
as
well
as
I.
<EOS>
what
be
the
fine
lady
in
the
puppet
-
show
just
now
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
do
not
lie
all
night
out
from
her
husband
for
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
landlady
now
burst
into
the
kitchen
,
and
fall
foul
on
both
her
husband
and
the
poor
puppet
-
mover
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
,
husband
,
"
say
she
,
"
you
see
the
consequence
of
harbour
these
people
in
your
house
.
<EOS>
if
one
doth
draw
a
little
drink
the
more
for
them
,
one
be
hardly
make
amend
for
the
litter
they
make
;
and
then
to
have
one
's
house
make
a
bawdy
-
house
of
by
such
lousy
vermin
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
desire
you
would
be
go
to
-
morrow
morning
;
for
I
will
tolerate
no
more
such
doing
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
the
way
to
teach
our
servant
idleness
and
nonsense
;
for
to
be
sure
nothing
well
can
be
learn
by
such
idle
show
as
these
.
<EOS>
I
remember
when
puppet
-
show
be
make
of
good
scripture
story
,
as
Jephthah
's
Rash
Vow
,
and
such
good
thing
,
and
when
wicked
people
be
carry
away
by
the
devil
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
sense
in
those
matter
;
but
as
the
parson
tell
us
last
Sunday
,
nobody
believe
in
the
devil
now
-
a
-
day
;
and
here
you
bring
about
a
parcel
of
puppet
dr
up
like
lord
and
lady
,
only
to
turn
the
head
of
poor
country
wench
;
and
when
their
head
be
once
turn
topsy
-
turvy
,
no
wonder
everything
else
be
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
Virgil
,
I
think
,
tell
us
,
that
when
the
mob
be
assemble
in
a
riotous
and
tumultuous
manner
,
and
all
sort
of
missile
weapon
fly
about
,
if
a
man
of
gravity
and
authority
appear
amongst
them
,
the
tumult
be
presently
appeased
,
and
the
mob
,
which
when
collect
into
one
body
,
may
be
well
compare
to
an
ass
,
erect
their
long
ear
at
the
grave
man
's
discourse
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
when
a
set
of
grave
man
and
philosopher
be
dispute
;
when
wisdom
herself
may
in
a
manner
be
consider
as
present
,
and
administer
argument
to
the
disputant
;
should
a
tumult
arise
among
the
mob
,
or
should
one
scold
,
who
be
herself
equal
in
noise
to
a
mighty
mob
,
appear
among
the
say
philosopher
;
their
dispute
cease
in
a
moment
,
wisdom
no
longer
perform
her
ministerial
office
,
and
the
attention
of
every
one
be
immediately
attract
by
the
scold
alone
.
  
<EOS>
thus
the
uproar
aforesaid
,
and
the
arrival
of
the
landlady
,
silence
the
master
of
the
puppet
-
show
,
and
put
a
speedy
and
final
end
to
that
grave
and
solemn
harangue
,
of
which
we
have
give
the
reader
a
sufficient
taste
already
.
<EOS>
nothing
indeed
could
have
happen
so
very
inopportune
as
this
accident
;
the
most
wanton
malice
of
fortune
could
not
have
contrive
such
another
stratagem
to
confound
the
poor
fellow
,
while
he
be
so
triumphantly
descanting
on
the
good
moral
inculcate
by
his
exhibition
.
<EOS>
His
mouth
be
now
as
effectually
stopt
,
as
that
of
quack
must
be
,
if
,
in
the
midst
of
a
declamation
on
the
great
virtue
of
his
pill
and
powder
,
the
corpse
of
one
of
his
martyr
should
be
bring
forth
,
and
deposit
before
the
stage
,
as
a
testimony
of
his
skill
.
  
<EOS>
instead
,
therefore
,
of
answer
my
landlady
,
the
puppet
-
show
man
run
out
to
punish
his
Merry
Andrew
;
and
now
the
moon
begin
to
put
forth
her
silver
light
,
as
the
poet
call
it
<EOS>
(
though
she
look
at
that
time
more
like
a
piece
of
copper
)
,
Jones
call
for
his
reckoning
,
and
order
Partridge
,
whom
my
landlady
have
just
awake
from
a
profound
nap
,
to
prepare
for
his
journey
;
but
Partridge
,
have
lately
carry
two
point
,
as
my
reader
hath
see
before
,
be
embolden
to
attempt
a
third
,
which
be
to
prevail
with
Jones
to
take
up
a
lodging
that
evening
in
the
house
where
he
then
be
.
<EOS>
He
introduce
this
with
an
affected
surprize
at
the
intention
which
Mr
Jones
declare
of
remove
;
and
,
after
urge
many
excellent
argument
against
it
,
he
at
last
insist
strongly
that
it
could
be
to
no
manner
of
purpose
whatever
;
for
that
,
unless
Jones
know
which
way
the
lady
be
go
,
every
step
he
take
may
very
possibly
lead
him
the
farther
from
her
;
"
for
you
find
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
by
all
the
people
in
the
house
,
that
she
be
not
go
this
way
.
<EOS>
how
much
better
,
therefore
,
would
it
be
to
stay
till
the
morning
,
when
we
may
expect
to
meet
with
somebody
to
enquire
of
?
"
  
<EOS>
this
last
argument
have
indeed
some
effect
on
Jones
,
and
while
he
be
weigh
it
the
landlord
throw
all
the
rhetoric
of
which
he
be
master
into
the
same
scale
.
<EOS>
"
sure
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
your
servant
give
you
most
excellent
advice
;
for
who
would
travel
by
night
at
this
time
of
the
year
?
"
<EOS>
He
then
begin
in
the
usual
stile
to
trumpet
forth
the
excellent
accommodation
which
his
house
afford
;
and
my
landlady
likewise
open
on
the
occasion
 
<EOS>
but
,
not
to
detain
the
reader
with
what
be
common
to
every
host
and
hostess
,
it
be
sufficient
to
tell
him
Jones
be
at
last
prevail
on
to
stay
and
refresh
himself
with
a
few
hour
'
rest
,
which
indeed
he
very
much
want
;
for
he
have
hardly
shut
his
eye
since
he
have
leave
the
inn
where
the
accident
of
the
broken
head
have
happen
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Jones
have
take
a
resolution
to
proceed
no
farther
that
night
,
he
presently
retire
to
rest
,
with
his
two
bedfellow
,
the
pocket
-
book
and
the
muff
;
but
Partridge
,
who
at
several
time
have
refresh
himself
with
several
nap
,
be
more
inclined
to
eat
than
to
sleep
,
and
more
to
drink
than
to
either
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
the
storm
which
Grace
have
raise
be
at
an
end
,
and
my
landlady
be
again
reconcile
to
the
puppet
-
man
,
who
on
his
side
forgave
the
indecent
reflection
which
the
good
woman
in
her
passion
have
cast
on
his
performance
,
a
face
of
perfect
peace
and
tranquillity
reign
in
the
kitchen
<EOS>
;
where
sat
assemble
round
the
fire
the
landlord
and
landlady
of
the
house
,
the
master
of
the
puppet
-
show
,
the
attorney
's
clerk
,
the
exciseman
,
and
the
ingenious
Mr
Partridge
;
in
which
company
past
the
agreeable
conversation
which
will
be
find
in
the
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
contain
a
remark
or
two
of
our
own
and
many
more
of
the
good
company
assemble
in
the
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
though
the
pride
of
Partridge
do
not
submit
to
acknowledge
himself
a
servant
,
yet
he
condescend
in
most
particular
to
imitate
the
manner
of
that
rank
.
<EOS>
one
instance
of
this
be
,
his
greatly
magnify
the
fortune
of
his
companion
,
as
he
call
Jones
:
<EOS>
such
be
a
general
custom
with
all
servant
among
stranger
,
as
none
of
them
would
willingly
be
think
the
attendant
on
a
beggar
:
for
,
the
high
the
situation
of
the
master
be
,
<EOS>
the
high
consequently
be
that
of
the
man
in
his
own
opinion
;
the
truth
of
which
observation
appear
from
the
behaviour
of
all
the
footman
of
the
nobility
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
though
title
and
fortune
communicate
a
splendor
all
around
them
,
and
the
footman
of
man
of
quality
and
of
estate
think
themselves
entitle
to
a
part
of
that
respect
which
be
pay
to
the
quality
and
estate
of
their
master
,
it
be
clearly
otherwise
with
regard
to
virtue
and
understanding
.
<EOS>
these
advantage
be
strictly
personal
,
and
swallow
themselves
all
the
respect
which
be
pay
to
them
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
this
be
so
very
little
,
that
they
can
not
well
afford
to
let
any
other
partake
with
them
.
<EOS>
as
these
therefore
reflect
no
honour
on
the
domestic
,
so
neither
be
he
at
all
dishonour
by
the
most
deplorable
want
of
both
in
his
master
.
<EOS>
indeed
it
be
otherwise
in
the
want
of
what
be
call
virtue
in
a
mistress
,
the
consequence
of
which
we
have
before
see
:
for
in
this
dishonour
there
be
a
kind
of
contagion
,
which
,
like
that
of
poverty
,
communicate
itself
to
all
who
approach
it
.
  
<EOS>
now
for
these
reason
we
be
not
to
wonder
that
servant
(
I
mean
among
the
man
only
)
should
have
so
great
regard
for
the
reputation
of
the
wealth
of
their
master
,
and
little
or
none
at
all
for
their
character
in
other
point
,
and
that
,
though
they
would
be
ashamed
to
be
the
footman
of
a
beggar
,
they
be
not
so
to
attend
upon
a
rogue
or
a
blockhead
;
and
do
consequently
make
no
scruple
to
spread
the
fame
of
the
iniquity
and
folly
of
their
say
master
as
far
as
possible
,
and
this
often
with
great
humour
and
merriment
.
<EOS>
in
reality
,
a
footman
be
often
a
wit
as
well
as
a
beau
,
at
the
expence
of
the
gentleman
whose
livery
he
wear
.
  
<EOS>
after
Partridge
,
therefore
,
have
enlarge
greatly
on
the
vast
fortune
to
which
Mr
Jones
be
heir
,
he
very
freely
communicate
an
apprehension
,
which
he
have
begin
to
conceive
the
day
before
,
and
for
which
,
as
we
hint
at
that
very
time
,
the
behaviour
of
Jones
seem
to
have
furnish
a
sufficient
foundation
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
be
now
pretty
well
confirm
in
an
opinion
that
his
master
be
out
of
his
wit
,
with
which
opinion
he
very
bluntly
acquaint
the
good
company
round
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
sentiment
the
puppet
-
show
man
immediately
coincide
.
<EOS>
"
I
own
,
"
say
he
,
"
the
gentleman
surprize
me
very
much
,
when
he
talk
so
absurdly
about
puppet
-
show
.
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
hardly
to
be
conceive
that
any
man
in
his
sense
should
be
so
much
mistaken
;
what
you
say
now
account
very
well
for
all
his
monstrous
notion
.
<EOS>
poor
gentleman
!
<EOS>
I
be
heartily
concerned
for
him
;
indeed
he
hath
a
strange
wildness
about
his
eye
,
which
I
take
notice
of
before
,
though
I
do
not
mention
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
landlord
agree
with
this
last
assertion
,
and
likewise
claim
the
sagacity
of
have
observe
it
.
"
<EOS>
and
certainly
,
"
add
he
,
"
it
must
be
so
;
for
no
one
but
a
madman
would
have
think
of
leave
so
good
a
house
to
ramble
about
the
country
at
that
time
of
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
exciseman
,
pull
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
,
say
,
"
He
think
the
gentleman
look
and
talk
a
little
wildly
;
"
and
then
turn
to
Partridge
,
"
if
he
be
a
madman
,
"
say
he
,
"
he
should
not
be
suffer
to
travel
thus
about
the
country
;
for
possibly
he
may
do
some
mischief
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
he
be
not
secure
and
send
home
to
his
relation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
now
some
conceit
of
this
kind
be
likewise
lurk
in
the
mind
of
Partridge
;
for
,
as
he
be
now
persuade
that
Jones
have
run
away
from
Mr
Allworthy
,
he
promise
himself
the
high
reward
if
he
could
by
any
mean
convey
him
back
.
<EOS>
but
fear
of
Jones
,
of
whose
fierceness
and
strength
he
have
see
,
and
indeed
feel
,
some
instance
,
have
however
represent
any
such
scheme
as
impossible
to
be
execute
,
and
have
discourage
him
from
apply
himself
to
form
any
regular
plan
for
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
but
no
sooner
do
he
hear
the
sentiment
of
the
exciseman
than
he
embrace
that
opportunity
of
declare
his
own
,
and
express
a
hearty
wish
that
such
a
matter
could
be
bring
about
.
  
<EOS>
"
Could
be
bring
about
!
"
say
the
exciseman
:
"
why
,
there
be
nothing
easy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
sir
<EOS>
,
"
answer
Partridge
,
"
you
do
not
know
what
a
devil
of
a
fellow
he
be
.
<EOS>
He
can
take
me
up
with
one
hand
,
and
throw
me
out
at
window
;
and
he
would
,
too
,
if
he
do
but
imagine
"
  
"
Pogh
!
"
say
the
exciseman
,
"
I
believe
I
be
as
good
a
man
as
he
.
<EOS>
besides
,
here
be
five
of
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
five
,
"
cry
the
landlady
,
"
my
husband
shall
have
nothing
to
do
in
it

<EOS>
nor
shall
any
violent
hand
be
lay
upon
anybody

house

<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
be
as
pretty
a
young
gentleman
as
ever
<EOS>
I
see
in
my
life
,
and
I
believe
he
be
no
more
mad
than
any
of
us

<EOS>
what
do
you
tell
of
his
have
a
wild
look

his
eye
?
<EOS>
they
be
the
pretty
eye
I
ever
see
,

he
hath
the
prettiest
look
with
them
;
and
a
very
modest
civil
young
man
he
be

<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
have
bepitie
him
heartily
ever
since
the
gentleman
there
in
the
corner
tell
us
he
be
crost
in
love

<EOS>
certainly
that
be
enough
to
make
any
man
,
especially
such
a
sweet
young
gentleman
as
he
be
,
to
look
a
little
otherwise
than
he
do
before

Lady
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
what
the
devil
would
the
lady
have
well
than
such
a
handsome
man
with
a
great
estate
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
be
one
of
your
quality
folk
,
one
of
your
Townly
lady
that
we
see
last
night
in
the
puppet
-
show
,
who
do
not
know
what
they
would
be
at

"
  
<EOS>
the
attorney
's
clerk
likewise
declare
he
would
have
no
concern
in
the
business
without
the
advice
of
counsel

"
suppose
,
"
say
he
,

an
action
of
false
imprisonment
should

against

could
we
make

<EOS>
who
know
what
may
be
sufficient
evidence
of
madness
to

jury

<EOS>
but
I
only
speak
upon
my
own
account

for
it
do
not
look
well
for

in

unless

less
favourable

I
do
not
therefore
dissuade
you
,
Mr
Thomson
(
to
the
exciseman

,
nor

"
  
<EOS>
the
exciseman
shake
his
head
at
this
speech
,
and
the
puppet

show
man
say
,
"
Madness
be
sometimes
a
difficult
matter
for
a
jury
to
decide

for
I
remember

say
he
,
"
I
be
once
present
at
a
tryal
of
madness

where
twenty

twenty
other

that
he
be
as
much
in

<EOS>
and
indeed
it
be
the
opinion

me
the

thing
;

my

be
always
so
afraid

I
know
a
great
many
papishe
that
be
very
honest
sort
of
people
,
and
spend
their
money
very
freely
;
and
it
be
always
a
maxim
with
me

that
one
man
's
money
be
as
good
as
another
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
true

mistress

the

man

I
do
not
care
what
religion
come
;
provide
the
Presbyterians
be
not
uppermost
;
for
they
be
enemy
to
puppet
-
show
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
so
you
would
sacrifice
your
religion
to
your
interest

cry
the
exciseman
;

be
desirous
to
see
popery
bring
in

be
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
I
,
truly
,
"
answer
the
other
;
"
I
hate
popery
as
much
as
any
man
;
but
yet
it
be
a
comfort
to
one
,
that
one
should
be
able
to
live
under
it
,
which
I
could
not
do
among
Presbyterians
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
every
man
value
his
livelihood
first
;
that
must
be
grant
;
and
I
warrant
,
if
you
would
confess
the
truth
,
you
be
more
afraid
of
lose
your
place
than
anything
else
;
but
never
fear
,
friend
,
there
will
be
an
excise
under
another
government
as
well
as
under
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
certainly
,
"
reply
the
exciseman
,
"
I
should
be
a
very
ill
man
if
I
do
not
honour
the
king
,
whose
bread
I
eat

<EOS>
that
be
no
more
than
natural
,
as
a
man
may
say
:
for
what
signify
it
to
me
that
there
would
be
an
excise
-
office
under
another
government

since
my
friend
would
be
out
,
and
I
could
expect
no
well
than
to
follow
them
?
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
friend
,
I
shall
never
be
bubble
out
of
my
religion
in
hope
only
of
keep
my
place
under
another

for
I
should
certainly
be
no
well

very
probably
may
be
bad

"
  
<EOS>

why

I

"
  
<EOS>
the
attorney
's
clerk
have
take
a
great
fancy
to
the
sagacity
of
Partridge
.
<EOS>
whether
this
proceed
from
the
great
discernment
which
the
former
have
into
man
,
as
well
as
thing
,
or
whether
it
arise
from
the
sympathy
between
their
mind
;
for
they
be
both
truly
Jacobites
in
principle
;
they
now
shake
hand
heartily
,
and
drink
bumper
of
strong
beer
to
health
which
we
think
proper
to
bury
in
oblivion
.
  
<EOS>
these
health
be
afterwards
pledge
by
all
present
,
and
even
by
my
landlord
himself
,
though
reluctantly
;
but
he
could
not
withstand
the
menace
of
the
clerk
,
who
swear
he
would
never
set
his
foot
within
his
house
again
,
if
he
refuse
.
<EOS>
the
bumper
which
be
swallow
on
this
occasion
soon
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
here
,
therefore
,
we
will
put
an
end
to
the
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
fortune
seem
to
have
be
in
a
well
humour
with
Jones
than
we
have
hitherto
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
as
there
be
no
wholesomer
,
so
perhaps
there
be
few
strong
,
sleep
potion
than
fatigue
.
<EOS>
of
this
Jones
may
be
say
to
have
take
a
very
large
dose
,
and
it
operate
very
forcibly
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
already
sleep
nine
hour
,
and
may
perhaps
have
sleep
longer
,
have
he
not
be
awaken
by
a
most
violent
noise
at
his
chamber
-
door
,
where
the
sound
of
many
heavy
blow
be
accompany
with
many
exclamation
of
murder
.
<EOS>
Jones
presently
leapt
from
his
bed
,
where
he
find
the
master
of
the
puppet
-
show
belabour
the
back
and
rib
of
his
poor
Merry
-
Andrew
,
without
either
mercy
or
moderation
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
instantly
interpose
on
behalf
of
the
suffer
party
,
and
pin
the
insult
conqueror
up
to
the
wall
:
for
the
puppet
-
show
man
be
no
more
able
to
contend
with
Jones
than
the
poor
party
-
colour
jester
have
be
to
contend
with
this
puppet
-
man
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
the
Merry
-
Andrew
be
a
little
fellow
,
and
not
very
strong
,
he
have
nevertheless
some
choler
about
him
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
no
sooner
find
himself
deliver
from
the
enemy
,
than
he
begin
to
attack
him
with
the
only
weapon
at
which
he
be
his
equal
.
<EOS>
from
this
he
first
discharge
a
volley
of
general
abusive
word
,
and
thence
proceed
to
some
particular
accusation
 
"
D####n
your
bl
 
d
,
you
rascal
,
"
say
he
,
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
only
support
you
(
for
to
me
you
owe
all
the
money
you
get
)
,
but
I
have
save
you
from
the
gallow
.
<EOS>
do
you
not
want
to
rob
the
lady
of
her
fine
riding
-
habit
,
no
longer
ago
than
yesterday
,
in
the
back
-
lane
here
?
<EOS>
Can
you
deny
that
you
wish
to
have
her
alone
in
a
wood
to
strip
her
 
to
strip
one
of
the
prettiest
lady
that
ever
be
see
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
and
here
you
have
fall
upon
me
,
and
have
almost
murder
me
,
for
do
no
harm
to
a
girl
as
willing
as
myself
,
only
because
she
like
me
better
than
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
no
sooner
hear
this
than
he
quit
the
master
,
lay
on
him
at
the
same
time
the
most
violent
injunction
of
forbearance
from
any
further
insult
on
the
Merry
-
Andrew
;
and
then
take
the
poor
wretch
with
him
into
his
own
apartment
,
he
soon
learn
tiding
of
his
Sophia
,
whom
the
fellow
,
as
he
be
attend
his
master
with
his
drum
the
day
before
,
have
see
pass
by
.
<EOS>
He
easily
prevail
with
the
lad
to
show
him
the
exact
place
,
and
then
have
summon
Partridge
,
he
depart
with
the
utmost
expedition
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
almost
eight
of
the
clock
before
all
matter
could
be
get
ready
for
his
departure
:
for
Partridge
be
not
in
any
haste
,
nor
could
the
reckoning
be
presently
adjust
;
and
when
both
these
be
settle
and
over
,
Jones
would
not
quit
the
place
before
he
have
perfectly
reconcile
all
difference
between
the
master
and
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
when
this
be
happily
accomplish
,
he
set
forwards
,
and
be
by
the
trusty
Merry
-
Andrew
conduct
to
the
spot
by
which
Sophia
have
past
;
and
then
have
handsomely
reward
his
conductor
,
he
again
push
on
with
the
utmost
eagerness
,
be
highly
delighted
with
the
extraordinary
manner
in
which
he
receive
his
intelligence
.
<EOS>
of
this
Partridge
be
no
sooner
acquaint
,
than
he
,
with
great
earnestness
,
begin
to
prophesy
,
and
assure
Jones
that
he
would
certainly
have
good
success
in
the
end
:
for
,
he
say
,
"
two
such
accident
could
never
have
happen
to
direct
him
after
his
mistress
,
if
Providence
have
not
design
to
bring
them
together
at
last
.
"
<EOS>
and
this
be
the
first
time
that
Jones
lend
any
attention
to
the
superstitious
doctrine
of
his
companion
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
not
go
above
two
mile
when
a
violent
storm
of
rain
overtook
them
;
and
,
as
they
happen
to
be
at
the
same
time
in
sight
of
an
ale
-
house
,
Partridge
,
with
much
earnest
entreaty
,
prevail
with
Jones
to
enter
,
and
weather
the
storm
.
<EOS>
Hunger
be
an
enemy
(
if
indeed
it
may
be
call
one
)
which
partake
more
of
the
English
than
of
the
french
disposition
;
for
,
though
you
subdue
this
never
so
often
,
it
will
always
rally
again
in
time
;
and
so
it
do
with
Partridge
,
who
be
no
sooner
arrive
within
the
kitchen
,
than
he
begin
to
ask
the
same
question
which
he
have
ask
the
night
before
.
<EOS>
the
consequence
of
this
be
an
excellent
cold
chine
be
produce
upon
the
table
,
upon
which
not
only
Partridge
,
but
Jones
himself
,
make
a
very
hearty
breakfast
,
though
the
latter
begin
to
grow
again
uneasy
,
as
the
people
of
the
house
could
give
him
no
fresh
information
concern
Sophia
.
  
<EOS>
Their
meal
be
over
,
Jones
be
again
prepare
to
sally
,
notwithstanding
the
violence
of
the
storm
still
continue
;
but
Partridge
beg
heartily
for
another
mug
;
and
at
last
cast
his
eye
on
a
lad
at
the
fire
,
who
have
enter
into
the
kitchen
,
and
who
at
that
instant
be
look
as
earnestly
at
him
,
he
turn
suddenly
to
Jones
,
and
cry
,
"
Master
,
give
me
your
hand
,
a
single
mug
shall
not
serve
the
turn
this
bout
.
<EOS>
why
,
here
be
more
news
of
Madam
Sophia
come
to
town
.
<EOS>
the
boy
there
stand
by
the
fire
be
the
very
lad
that
ride
before
her
.
<EOS>
I
can
swear
to
my
own
plaister
on
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Heavens
bless
you
,
sir
,
"
cry
the
boy
,
"
it
be
your
own
plaister
sure
enough
<EOS>
;
I
shall
have
always
reason
to
remember
your
goodness
;
for
it
hath
almost
cure
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
these
word
Jones
start
from
his
chair
,
and
,
bid
the
boy
follow
him
immediately
,
depart
from
the
kitchen
into
a
private
apartment
;
for
,
so
delicate
be
he
with
regard
to
Sophia
,
that
he
never
willingly
mention
her
name
in
the
presence
of
many
people
;
and
,
though
he
have
,
as
it
be
,
from
the
overflowing
of
his
heart
,
give
Sophia
as
a
toast
among
the
officer
,
where
he
think
it
be
impossible
she
should
be
know
;
yet
,
even
there
,
the
reader
may
remember
how
difficultly
he
be
prevail
upon
to
mention
her
surname
.
  
<EOS>
hard
therefore
be
it
,
and
perhaps
,
in
the
opinion
of
many
sagacious
reader
,
very
absurd
and
monstrous
,
that
he
should
principally
owe
his
present
misfortune
to
the
suppose
want
of
that
delicacy
with
which
he
so
abound
;
for
,
in
reality
,
Sophia
be
much
more
offend
at
the
freedom
which
she
think
(
and
not
without
good
reason
)
<EOS>
he
have
take
with
her
name
and
character
,
than
at
any
freedom
,
in
which
,
under
his
present
circumstance
,
he
have
indulge
himself
with
the
person
of
another
woman
;
and
to
say
truth
,
I
believe
Honour
could
never
have
prevail
on
her
to
leave
Upton
without
her
see
Jones
,
have
it
not
be
for
those
two
strong
instance
of
a
levity
in
his
behaviour
,
so
void
of
respect
,
and
indeed
so
highly
inconsistent
with
any
degree
of
love
and
tenderness
in
great
and
delicate
mind
.
  
<EOS>
but
so
matter
fall
out
,
and
so
I
must
relate
them
;
and
if
any
reader
be
shock
at
their
appear
unnatural
,
I
can
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
I
must
remind
such
person
that
I
be
not
write
a
system
,
but
a
history
,
and
I
be
not
oblige
to
reconcile
every
matter
to
the
receive
notion
concern
truth
and
nature
.
<EOS>
but
if
this
be
never
so
easy
to
do
,
perhaps
it
may
be
more
prudent
in
me
to
avoid
it
.
<EOS>
for
instance
,
as
the
fact
at
present
before
us
now
stand
,
without
any
comment
of
mine
upon
it
,
though
it
may
at
first
sight
offend
some
reader
,
yet
,
upon
more
mature
consideration
,
it
must
please
all
;
for
wise
and
good
man
may
consider
what
happen
to
Jones
at
Upton
as
a
just
punishment
for
his
wickedness
with
regard
to
woman
,
of
which
it
be
indeed
the
immediate
consequence
;
and
silly
and
bad
person
may
comfort
themselves
in
their
vice
by
flatter
their
own
heart
that
the
character
of
man
be
rather
owe
to
accident
than
to
virtue
.
<EOS>
now
,
perhaps
the
reflection
which
we
should
be
here
incline
to
draw
would
alike
contradict
both
these
conclusion
,
and
would
show
that
these
incident
contribute
only
to
confirm
the
great
,
useful
,
and
uncommon
doctrine
,
which
it
be
the
purpose
of
this
whole
work
to
inculcate
,
and
which
we
must
not
fill
up
our
page
by
frequently
repeat
,
as
an
ordinary
parson
fill
his
sermon
by
repeat
his
text
at
the
end
of
every
paragraph
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
contented
that
it
must
appear
,
however
unhappily
Sophia
have
err
in
her
opinion
of
Jones
,
she
have
sufficient
reason
for
her
opinion
;
since
,
I
believe
,
every
other
young
lady
would
,
in
her
situation
,
have
err
in
the
same
manner
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
have
she
follow
her
lover
at
this
very
time
,
and
have
enter
this
very
alehouse
the
moment
he
be
depart
from
it
<EOS>
,
she
would
have
find
the
landlord
as
well
acquaint
with
her
name
and
person
as
the
wench
at
Upton
have
appear
to
be
.
<EOS>
for
while
Jones
be
examine
his
boy
in
whisper
in
an
inner
room
,
Partridge
,
who
have
no
such
delicacy
in
his
disposition
,
be
in
the
kitchen
very
openly
catechise
the
other
guide
who
have
attend
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
;
by
which
mean
the
landlord
,
whose
ear
be
open
on
all
such
occasion
,
become
perfectly
well
acquaint
with
the
tumble
of
Sophia
from
her
horse
,
&
c.
,
with
the
mistake
concern
Jenny
Cameron
,
with
the
many
consequence
of
the
punch
,
and
,
in
short
,
with
almost
everything
which
have
happen
at
the
inn
whence
we
despatch
our
lady
in
a
coach
-
and
-
six
when
we
last
take
our
leave
of
them
.
    
<EOS>
contain
little
more
than
a
few
odd
observation
.
 
<EOS>
Jones
have
be
absent
a
full
half
-
hour
,
when
he
return
into
the
kitchen
in
a
hurry
,
desire
the
landlord
to
let
him
know
that
instant
what
be
to
pay
.
<EOS>
and
now
the
concern
which
Partridge
feel
at
be
oblige
to
quit
the
warm
chimney
-
corner
,
and
a
cup
of
excellent
liquor
,
be
somewhat
compensate
by
hear
that
he
be
to
proceed
no
farther
on
foot
,
for
Jones
,
by
golden
argument
,
have
prevail
with
the
boy
to
attend
him
back
to
the
inn
whither
he
have
before
conduct
Sophia
;
but
to
this
however
the
lad
consent
,
upon
condition
that
the
other
guide
would
wait
for
him
at
the
alehouse
;
because
,
as
the
landlord
at
Upton
be
an
intimate
acquaintance
of
the
landlord
at
Gloucester
,
it
may
some
time
or
other
come
to
the
ear
of
the
latter
that
his
horse
have
be
let
to
more
than
one
person
;
and
so
the
boy
may
be
bring
to
account
for
money
which
he
wisely
intend
to
put
in
his
own
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
oblige
to
mention
this
circumstance
,
trifle
as
it
may
seem
,
since
it
retard
Mr
Jones
a
considerable
time
in
his
set
out
;
for
the
honesty
of
this
latter
boy
be
somewhat
high
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
somewhat
high
-
price
,
and
would
indeed
have
cost
Jones
very
dear
,
have
not
Partridge
,
who
,
as
we
have
say
,
be
a
very
cunning
fellow
,
artfully
throw
in
<EOS>
half
-
a
-
crown
to
be
spend
at
that
very
alehouse
,
while
the
boy
be
wait
for
his
companion
.
<EOS>
this
half
-
crown
the
landlord
no
sooner
get
scent
of
,
than
he
open
after
it
with
such
vehement
and
persuasive
outcry
,
that
the
boy
be
soon
overcome
,
and
consent
to
take
half
-
a
-
crown
more
for
his
stay
.
<EOS>
here
we
can
not
help
observe
,
that
as
there
be
so
much
of
policy
in
the
low
life
,
great
man
often
overvalue
themselves
on
those
refinement
in
imposture
,
in
which
they
be
frequently
excel
by
some
of
the
low
of
the
human
specie
.
  
<EOS>
the
horse
be
now
produce
,
Jones
directly
leapt
into
the
side
-
saddle
,
on
which
his
dear
Sophia
have
rid
.
<EOS>
the
lad
,
indeed
,
very
civilly
offer
him
the
use
of
his
;
but
he
choose
the
side
-
saddle
,
probably
because
it
be
soft
.
<EOS>
partridge
,
however
,
though
full
as
effeminate
as
Jones
,
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
degrade
his
manhood
;
he
therefore
accept
the
boy
's
offer
:
and
now
,
Jones
be
mount
on
the
side
-
saddle
of
his
Sophia
,
the
boy
on
that
of
Mrs
Honour
,
and
Partridge
bestride
the
third
horse
,
they
set
forwards
on
their
journey
,
and
within
four
hour
arrive
at
the
inn
where
the
reader
hath
already
spend
so
much
time
.
<EOS>
partridge
be
in
very
high
spirit
during
the
whole
way
,
and
often
mention
to
Jones
the
many
good
omen
of
his
future
success
which
have
lately
befriend
him
;
and
which
the
reader
,
without
be
the
least
superstitious
,
must
allow
to
have
be
particularly
fortunate
.
<EOS>
partridge
be
moreover
better
pleased
with
the
present
pursuit
of
his
companion
than
he
have
be
with
his
pursuit
of
glory
;
and
from
these
very
omen
,
which
assure
the
pedagogue
of
success
,
he
likewise
first
acquire
a
clear
idea
of
the
amour
between
Jones
and
Sophia
;
to
which
he
have
before
give
very
little
attention
,
as
he
have
originally
take
a
wrong
scent
concern
the
reason
of
Jones
's
departure
;
and
as
to
what
happen
at
Upton
,
he
be
too
much
frightened
just
before
and
after
his
leave
that
place
to
draw
any
other
conclusion
from
thence
than
that
poor
Jones
be
a
downright
madman
:
<EOS>
a
conceit
which
be
not
at
all
disagreeable
to
the
opinion
he
before
have
of
his
extraordinary
wildness
,
of
which
,
he
think
,
his
behaviour
on
their
quitting
Gloucester
so
well
justify
all
the
account
he
have
formerly
receive
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
,
however
,
pretty
well
satisfied
with
his
present
expedition
,
and
henceforth
begin
to
conceive
much
worthy
sentiment
of
his
friend
's
understanding
.
  
<EOS>
the
clock
have
just
strike
three
when
they
arrive
,
and
Jones
immediately
bespoke
post
-
horse
;
but
unluckily
there
be
not
a
horse
to
be
procure
in
the
whole
place
;
which
the
reader
will
not
wonder
at
when
he
consider
the
hurry
in
which
the
whole
nation
,
and
especially
this
part
of
it
,
be
at
this
time
engage
,
when
express
be
pass
and
repasse
every
hour
of
the
day
and
night
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
endeavour
all
he
could
to
prevail
with
his
former
guide
to
escorte
him
to
Coventry
;
but
he
be
inexorable
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
argue
with
the
boy
in
the
inn
-
yard
,
a
person
come
up
to
him
,
and
salute
him
by
his
name
,
enquire
how
all
the
good
family
do
in
Somersetshire
;
and
now
Jones
cast
his
eye
upon
this
person
,
presently
discover
him
to
be
Mr
Dowling
,
the
lawyer
,
with
whom
he
have
dine
at
Gloucester
,
and
with
much
courtesy
return
the
salutation
.
  
<EOS>
dowle
very
earnestly
press
Mr
Jones
to
go
no
further
that
night
;
and
back
his
solicitation
with
many
unanswerable
argument
,
such
as
,
that
it
be
almost
dark
,
that
the
road
be
very
dirty
,
and
that
he
would
be
able
to
travel
much
well
by
day
-
light
,
with
many
other
equally
good
,
some
of
which
Jones
have
probably
suggest
to
himself
before
;
but
as
they
be
then
ineffectual
,
so
they
be
still
:
and
he
continue
resolute
in
his
design
,
even
though
he
should
be
oblige
to
set
out
on
foot
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
good
attorney
find
he
could
not
prevail
on
Jones
to
stay
,
he
as
strenuously
apply
himself
to
persuade
the
guide
to
accompany
him
.
<EOS>
He
urge
many
motive
to
induce
him
to
undertake
this
short
journey
,
and
at
last
conclude
with
say
,
"
do
you
think
the
gentleman
will
not
very
well
reward
you
for
your
trouble
?
"
  
<EOS>
two
to
one
be
odd
at
every
other
thing
as
well
as
at
foot
-
ball
.
<EOS>
but
the
advantage
which
this
united
force
hath
in
persuasion
or
entreaty
must
have
be
visible
to
a
curious
observer
;
for
he
must
have
often
see
,
that
when
a
father
,
a
master
,
a
wife
,
or
any
other
person
in
authority
,
have
stoutly
adhere
to
a
denial
against
all
the
reason
which
a
single
man
could
produce
,
they
have
afterwards
yield
to
the
repetition
of
the
same
sentiment
by
a
second
or
third
person
,
who
hath
undertake
the
cause
,
without
attempt
to
advance
anything
new
in
its
behalf
.
<EOS>
and
hence
,
perhaps
,
proceed
the
phrase
of
second
an
argument
or
a
motion
,
and
the
great
consequence
this
be
of
in
all
assembly
of
public
debate
.
<EOS>
hence
,
likewise
,
probably
it
be
,
that
in
our
court
of
law
we
often
hear
a
learn
gentleman
(
generally
a
serjeant
)
repeat
for
an
hour
together
what
another
learn
gentleman
,
who
speak
just
before
him
,
have
be
say
.
  
<EOS>
instead
of
account
for
this
,
we
shall
proceed
in
our
usual
manner
to
exemplify
it
in
the
conduct
of
the
lad
above
mention
,
who
submit
to
the
persuasion
of
Mr
Dowling
,
and
promise
once
more
to
admit
Jones
into
his
side
-
saddle
;
but
insist
on
first
give
the
poor
creature
a
good
bait
,
say
,
they
have
travel
a
great
way
,
and
be
rid
very
hard
.
<EOS>
indeed
this
caution
of
the
boy
be
needless
;
for
Jones
,
notwithstanding
his
hurry
and
impatience
,
would
have
order
this
of
himself
;
for
he
by
no
means
agree
with
the
opinion
of
those
who
consider
animal
as
mere
machine
,
and
when
they
bury
their
spur
in
the
belly
of
their
horse
,
imagine
the
spur
and
the
horse
to
have
an
equal
capacity
of
feel
pain
.
  
<EOS>
while
the
beast
be
eat
their
corn
,
or
rather
be
suppose
to
eat
it
(
for
,
as
the
boy
be
take
care
of
himself
in
the
kitchen
,
the
ostler
take
great
care
that
his
corn
should
not
be
consume
in
the
stable
)
,
Mr
Jones
,
at
the
earnest
desire
of
Mr
Dowling
,
accompany
that
gentleman
into
his
room
,
where
they
sit
down
together
over
a
bottle
of
wine
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
Mr
Jones
and
Mr
Dowling
drink
a
bottle
together
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Dowling
,
pour
out
a
glass
of
wine
,
name
the
health
of
the
good
Squire
Allworthy
;
add
,
"
if
you
please
,
sir
,
we
will
likewise
remember
his
nephew
and
heir
,
the
young
squire
:
<EOS>
come
,
<EOS>
sir
,
here
be
Mr
Blifil
to
you
,
a
very
pretty
young
gentleman
;
and
who
,
I
dare
swear
<EOS>
,
will
hereafter
make
a
very
considerable
figure
in
his
country
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
borough
for
him
myself
in
my
eye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
answer
Jones
,
"
I
be
convinced
you
do
not
intend
to
affront
me
,
so
I
shall
not
resent
it
;
but
I
promise
you
,
you
have
join
two
person
very
improperly
together
;
for
one
be
the
glory
of
the
human
specie
,
and
the
other
be
a
rascal
who
dishonour
the
name
of
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
dowling
stare
at
this
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
He
think
both
the
gentleman
have
a
very
unexceptionable
character
.
<EOS>
as
for
Squire
Allworthy
himself
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
never
have
the
happiness
to
see
him
;
but
all
the
world
talk
of
his
goodness
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
as
to
the
young
gentleman
,
I
never
see
him
but
once
,
when
I
carry
him
the
news
of
the
loss
of
his
mother
;
and
then
I
be
so
hurried
,
and
drive
,
and
tear
with
the
multiplicity
of
business
,
that
I
have
hardly
time
to
converse
with
him
;
but
he
look
so
like
a
very
honest
gentleman
,
and
behave
himself
so
prettily
,
<EOS>
that
I
protest
I
never
be
more
delighted
with
any
gentleman
since
I
be
bear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wonder
,
"
answer
Jones
,
"
that
he
should
impose
upon
you
in
so
short
an
acquaintance
;
for
he
hath
the
cunning
of
the
devil
himself
,
and
you
may
live
with
him
many
year
,
without
discover
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
breed
up
with
him
from
my
infancy
,
and
we
be
hardly
ever
asunder
;
but
it
be
very
lately
only
that
I
have
discover
half
the
villany
which
be
in
him
.
<EOS>
I
own
I
never
greatly
like
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
want
that
generosity
of
spirit
,
which
be
the
sure
foundation
of
all
that
be
great
and
noble
in
human
nature
.
<EOS>
I
see
a
selfishness
in
him
long
ago
which
I
despise
;
but
it
be
lately
,
very
lately
,
that
I
have
find
him
capable
of
the
basest
and
black
design
;
for
,
indeed
,
I
have
at
last
find
out
,
that
he
hath
take
an
advantage
of
the
openness
of
my
own
temper
,
and
hath
concert
the
deep
project
,
by
a
long
train
of
wicked
artifice
,
to
work
my
ruin
,
which
at
last
he
hath
effect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
!
<EOS>
ay
!
"
<EOS>
cry
dowle
;
"
I
protest
,
then
,
it
be
a
pity
such
a
person
should
inherit
the
great
estate
of
your
uncle
Allworthy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
alas
,
sir
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
you
do
me
an
honour
to
which
I
have
no
title

<EOS>
It
be
true
,
indeed
,
his
goodness
once
allow
me
the
liberty
of
call
him
by
a
much
near
name
;
but
as
this
be
only
a
voluntary
act
of
goodness
,
I
can
complain
of
no
injustice
when
he
think
proper
to
deprive
me
of
this
honour
;
since
the
loss
can
not
be
more
unmerited
than
the
gift
originally
be

<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
sir
,
I
be
no

Mr
Allworthy

if
the

who
be
incapable
of
set
a
true
value
on

virtue

should
think
,
in
his
behaviour

he
hath
deal
hardly
by

they
do
an
injustice
to
the
good
of
man

for
I
 
<EOS>

I
ask
your
pardon

I
shall
trouble
you
with
no
particular
relate

myself

only
as
you
seem
to
think
me
a
relation
of
Mr
Allworthy

I
think
proper
to
set
you
right
in
a
matter
that
may
draw
some
censure
upon
him
,
which
I
promise
you
I
would
rather
lose
my
life
than
give
occasion
to
.

I
protest

cry
dowling

"
you
talk
very
much

honour

would
tell

<EOS>
Jones
,
who
in
the
compliance
of
his
disposition
(
though
not
in
his
prudence
)
a
little
resemble
his
lovely
Sophia
,
be
easily
prevail
on
to
satisfy
Mr
Dowling
's
curiosity
,
by
relate
the
history
of
his
birth
and
education
,
which
he
do
,
like
Othello
.
              
<EOS>
E
ven
from
his
boyish
year
,
      
<EOS>
to
th
'
very
moment
<EOS>
he
be
bad
to
tell
:
  
the
which
to
hear
,
Dowling
,
like
Desdemona
,
do
seriously
incline
;
       
He
swear
'
twas
strange
,
'
twas
pass
strange
;
     
'
Twas
pitiful
,
'
twas
wonderous
pitiful

<EOS>
Mr
Dowling
be
indeed
very
greatly
affected
with
this
relation
;
for
he
have
not
divest
himself
of
humanity
by
be
an
attorney
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
nothing
be
more
unjust
than
to
carry
our
prejudice
against
a
profession
into
private
life
,
and
to
borrow
our
idea
of
a
man
from
our
opinion
of
his
calling
.
<EOS>
Habit
,
it
be
true
,
lessen
the
horror
of
those
action
which
the
profession
make
necessary
,
and
consequently
habitual
;
but
in
all
other
instance
,
nature
work
in
man
of
all
profession
alike
;
nay
,
perhaps
,
even
more
strongly
with
those
who
give
her
,
as
it
be
,
a
holiday
,
when
they
be
follow
their
ordinary
business
.
<EOS>
a
butcher
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
would
feel
compunction
at
the
slaughter
of
a
fine
horse
;
and
though
a
surgeon
can
feel
no
pain
in
cut
off
a
limb
,
I
have
know
him
compassionate
a
man
in
a
fit
of
the
gout
.
<EOS>
the
common
hangman
,
who
hath
stretch
the
neck
of
hundred
,
be
know
to
have
tremble
at

all
their
ferocity
,
and
become
very
gentle
member
of
civil
society
.
<EOS>
in
the
same
manner
an
attorney
may
feel
all
the
misery
and
distress
of
his
fellow
-
creature
,
provide
he
happen
not
to
be
concern
against
them
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
,
as
the
reader
know
,
be
yet
unacquainted
with
the
very
black
colour
in
which
he
have
be
represent
to
Mr
Allworthy
;
and
as
to
other
matter
,
he
do
not
shew
them
in
the
most
disadvantageous
light
;
for
though
he
be
unwilling
to
cast
any
blame
on
his
former
friend
and
patron
;
yet
he
be
not
very
desirous
of
heap
too
much
upon
himself
.
<EOS>
dowle
therefore
observe
,
and
not
without
reason
,
that
very
ill
office
must
have
be
do
him
by
somebody
:
"
for
certainly
,
"
cry
he
,
"
the
squire
would
never
have
disinherit
you
only
for
a
few
fault
,
which
any
young
gentleman
may
have
commit
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
can
not
properly
say
disinherit
:
for
to
be
sure
by
law
<EOS>
you
can
not
claim
as
heir
.
<EOS>
that
be
certain
;
that
nobody
nee
go
to
counsel
for
.
<EOS>
yet
when
a
gentleman
have
in
a
manner
adopt
you
thus
as
his
own
son
,
you
may
reasonably
have
expect
some
very
considerable
part
,
if
not
the
whole
;
nay
,
if
you
have
expect
the
whole
,
I
should
not
have
blame
you
:
for
certainly
all
man
be
for
get
as
much
as
they
can
,
and
they
be
not
to
be
blame
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
you
wrong
me
,
"
say
Jones
;
"
I
should
have
be
content
with
very
little
:
I
never
have
any
view
upon
Mr
Allworthy
's
fortune
;
nay
,
I
believe
I
may
truly
say
,
I
never
once
consider
what
he
could
or
may
give
me
.
<EOS>
this
I
solemnly
declare
,
if
he
have
do
a
prejudice
to
his
nephew
in
my
favour
,
I
would
have
undo
it
again
.
<EOS>
I
have
rather
enjoy
my
own
mind
than
the
fortune
of
another
man
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
poor
pride
arise
from
a
magnificent
house
,
a
numerous
equipage
,
a
splendid
table
,
and
from
all
the
other
advantage
or
appearance
of
fortune
,
compare
to
the
warm
,
solid
content
,
the
swell
satisfaction
,
the
thrilling
transport
,
and
the
exult
triumph
,
which
a
good
mind
enjoy
,
in
the
contemplation
of
a
generous
,
virtuous
,
noble
,
benevolent
action
?
<EOS>
I
envy
not
Blifil
in
the
prospect
of
his
wealth
;
nor
shall
I
envy
him
in
the
possession
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
think
myself
a
rascal
half
an
hour
,
to
exchange
situation
.
<EOS>
I
believe
,
indeed
,
Mr
Blifil
suspect
me
of
the
view
you
mention
;
and
I
suppose
these
suspicion
,
as
they
arise
from
the
baseness
of
his
own
heart
,
so
they
occasion
his
baseness
to
me
.
<EOS>
but
,
I
thank
Heaven
<EOS>
,
I
know
,
I
feel
 
<EOS>
I

I

"
why

be
Miss

cry
dowle

<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
her
toast
often
,
I
protest
,
though
I
never
see
her
;
but
they
say
she
be
extremely
handsome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
though
the
Latin
be
not
the
only
part
of
this
speech
which
Dowling
do
not
perfectly
understand
;
yet
there
be
somewhat
in
it
that
make
a
very
strong
impression
upon
him
.
<EOS>
and
though
he
endeavour
by
wink
,
nodding
,
sneer
,
and
grin
,
to
hide
the
impression
from
Jones
(
for
we
be
as
often
ashamed
of
think
right
as
of
think
wrong
)
,
it
be
certain
he
secretly
approve
as
much
of
his
sentiment
as
he
understand
,
and
really
feel
a
very
strong
impulse
of
compassion
for
him
.
<EOS>
but
we
may
possibly
take
some
other
opportunity
of
comment
upon
this
,
especially
if
we
should
happen
to
meet
Mr
dowle
any
more
in
the
course
of
our
history
.
<EOS>
at
present
we
be
oblige
to
take
our
leave
of
that
gentleman
a
little
abruptly
,
in
imitation
of
Mr
Jones
;
who
be
no
sooner
inform
,
by
Partridge
,
that
his
horse
be
ready
,
than
he
deposit
his
reckoning
,
wish
his
companion
a
good
night
,
mount
,
and
set
forward
towards
Coventry
,
though
the
night
be
dark
,
and
it
just
then
begin
to
rain
very
hard
.
    
<EOS>
the
disaster
which
befel
Jones
on
his
departure
for
Coventry
;
with
the
sage
remark
of
Partridge
.
 
<EOS>
no
road
can
be
plain
than
that
from
the
place
where
they
now
be
to
Coventry
;
and
though
neither
Jones
,
nor
Partridge
,
nor
the
guide
,
have
ever
travel
it
before
,
it
would
have
be
almost
impossible
to
have
miss
their
way
,
have
it
not
be
for
the
two
reason
mention
in
the
conclusion
of
the
last
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
these
two
circumstance
,
however
,
happen
both
unfortunately
to
intervene
,
our
traveller
deviate
into
a
much
less
frequented
track
;
and
after
ride
full
six
mile
,
instead
of
arrive
at
the
stately
spire
of
Coventry
,
they
find
themselves
still
in
a
very
dirty
lane
,
where
they
see
no
symptom
of
approach
the
suburb
of
a
large
city
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
now
declare
that
they
must
certainly
have
lose
their
way
;
but
this
the
guide
insist
upon
be
impossible
;
a
word
which
,
in
common
conversation
,
be
often
use
to
signify
not
only
improbable
,
but
often
what
be
really
very
likely
,
and
,
sometimes
,
what
hath
certainly
happen
;
an
hyperbolical
violence
like
that
which
be
so
frequently
offer
to
the
word
infinite
and
eternal
;
by
the
former
of
which
it
be
usual
to
express
a
distance
of
half
a
yard
,
and
by
the
latter
,
a
duration
of
five
minute
.
<EOS>
and
thus
it
be
as
usual
to
assert
the
impossibility
of
lose
what
be
already
actually
lose
.
<EOS>
this
be
,
in
fact
,
the
case
at
present
;
for
,
notwithstanding
all
the
confident
assertion
of
the
lad
to
the
contrary
,
it
be
certain
they
be
no
more
in
the
right
road
to
Coventry
,
than
the
fraudulent
,
griping
,
cruel
,
cant
miser
be
in
the
right
road
to
heaven
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
,
perhaps
,
easy
for
a
reader
,
who
hath
never
be
in
those
circumstance
,
to
imagine
the
horror
with
which
darkness
,
rain
,
and
wind
,
fill
person
who
have
lose
their
way
in
the
night
;
and
who
,
consequently
,
have
not
the
pleasant
prospect
of
warm
fire
,
dry
cloath
,
and
other
refreshment
,
to
support
their
mind
in
struggle
with
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
.
<EOS>
a
very
imperfect
idea
of
this
horror
will
,
however
,
serve
sufficiently
to
account
for
the
conceit
which
now
fill
the
head
of
Partridge
,
and
which
we
shall
presently
be
oblige
to
open
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
grow
more
and
more
positive
that
they
be
out
of
their
road
;
and
the
boy
himself
at
last
acknowledge
he
believe
they
be
not
in
the
right
road
to
Coventry
;
though
he
affirm
,
at
the
same
time
,
it
be
impossible
they
should
have
mist
the
way
.
<EOS>
but
Partridge
be
of
a
different
opinion
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
when
they
first
set
out
he
imagine
some
mischief
or
other
would
happen
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
observe
,
sir
,
"
say
he
to
Jones
,
"
that
old
woman
who
stand
at
the
door
just
as
you
be
take
horse
?
<EOS>
I
wish
you
have
give
her
a
small
matter
,
with
all
my
heart
;
for
she
say
then
you
may
repent
it
;
and
at
that
very
instant
it
begin
to
rain
,
and
the
wind
hath
continue
rise
ever
since
.
<EOS>
whatever
some
people
may
think
,
I
be
very
certain
it
be
in
the
power
of
witch
to
raise
the
wind
whenever
they
please
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
it
happen
very
often
in
my
time
:
<EOS>
and
if
ever
I
see
a
witch
in
all
my
life
,
that
old
woman
be
certainly
one
.
<EOS>
I
think
so
to
myself
at
that
very
time
;
and
if
I
have
have
any
halfpence
in
my
pocket
,
I
would
have
give
her
some
;
for
to
be
sure
it
be
always
good
to
be
charitable
to
those
sort
of
people
,
for
fear
what
may
happen
;
and
many
a
person
hath
lose
his
cattle
by
save
a
halfpenny
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
,
though
he
be
horridly
vex
at
the
delay
which
this
mistake
be
likely
to
occasion
in
his
journey
,
could
not
help
smile
at
the
superstition
of
his
friend
,
whom
an
accident
now
greatly
confirm
in
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
tumble
from
his
horse
;
by
which
,
however
,
he
receive
no
other
injury
than
what
the
dirt
confer
on
his
cloath
.
  
<EOS>
partridge
have
no
sooner
recover
his
leg
,
than
he
appeal
to
his
fall
,
as
conclusive
evidence
of
all
he
have
assert
;
but
Jones
find
he
be
unhurt
,
<EOS>
answer
with
a
smile
:
"
this
witch
of
yours
,
Partridge
,
be
a
most
ungrateful
jade
,
and
doth
<EOS>
not
,
I
find
,
distinguish
her
friend
from
other
in
her
resentment
.
<EOS>
if
the
old
lady
have
be
angry
with
me
for
neglect
her
,
I
do
not
see
why
she
should
tumble
you
from
your
horse
,
after
all
the
respect
you
have
express
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
ill
jesting
,
"
cry
Partridge
,
"
with
people
who
have
power
to
do
these
thing
;
for
they
be
often
very
malicious
.
<EOS>
I
remember
a
farrier
,
who
provoke
one
of
them
,
by
ask
her
when
the
time
she
have
bargain
with
the
devil
for
would
be
out
;
and
within
three
month
from
that
very
day
one
of
his
good
cow
be
drown
.
<EOS>
nor
be
she
satisfied
with
that
;
for
a
little
time
afterwards
he
lose
a
barrel
of
good
-
drink
:
for
the
old
witch
pull
out
the
spigot
,
and
let
it
run
all
over
the
cellar
,
the
very
first
evening
he
have
tap
it
to
make
merry
with
some
of
his
neighbour
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
nothing
ever
thrive
with
him
afterwards
;
for
she
worry
the
poor
man
so
,
that
he
take
to
drinking
;
and
in
a
year
or
two
<EOS>
his
stock
be
seize
,
and
he
and
his
family
be
now
come
to
the
parish
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
guide
,
and
perhaps
his
horse
too
,
be
both
so
attentive
to
this
discourse
,
that
,
either
through
want
of
care
,
or
by
the
malice
of
the
witch
,
they
be
now
both
sprawl
in
the
dirt
.
  
<EOS>
Partridge
entirely
impute
this
fall
,
as
he
have
do
his
own
,
to
the
same
cause
.
<EOS>
He
tell
Mr
Jones
,
"
It
would
certainly
be
his
turn
next
;
and
earnestly
entreat
him
to
return
back
,
and
find
out
the
old
woman
,
and
pacify
her
.
<EOS>
We
shall
very
soon
,
"
add
he
,
"
reach
the
inn
;
for
though
we
have
seem
to
go
forward
,
I
be
very
certain
we
be
in
the
identical
place
in
which
we
be
an
hour
ago
;
and
I
dare
swear
,
if
it
be
daylight
,
we
may
now
see
the
inn
we
set
out
from
.
"
  
<EOS>
instead
of
return
any
answer
to
this
sage
advice
,
Jones
be
entirely
attentive
to
what
have
happen
to
the
boy
,
who
receive
no
other
hurt
than
what
have
before
befall
Partridge
,
and
which
his
cloath
very
easily
bore
,
as
they
have
be
for
many
year
inure
to
the
like
.
<EOS>
He
soon
regain
his
side
-
saddle
,
and
by
the
hearty
curse
and
blow
which
he
bestow
on
his
horse
<EOS>
,
quickly
satisfy
Mr
Jones
that
no
harm
be
do
.
    
<EOS>
relate
that
Mr
Jones
continue
his
journey
,
contrary
to
the
advice
of
Partridge
,
with
what
happen
on
that
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
They
now
discover
a
light
at
some
distance
,
to
the
great
pleasure
of
Jones
,
and
to
the
no
small
terror
of
Partridge
,
who
firmly
believe
himself
to
be
bewitch
,
and
that
this
light
be
a
Jack
-
with
-
a
-
lantern
,
or
somewhat
more
mischievous
.
  
<EOS>
but
how
be
these
fear
increase
,
when
,
as
they
approach
near
to
this
light
(
or
light
as
they
now
appear
)
,
they
hear
a
confused
sound
of
human
voice
;
of
singing
,
laughing
,
and
hallow
,
together
with
a
strange
noise
that
seem
to
proceed
from
some
instrument
;
but
could
hardly
be
allow
the
name
of
music
!
<EOS>
indeed
,
to
favour
a
little
the
opinion
of
Partridge
,
it
may
very
well
be
call
music
bewitch
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
conceive
a
much
great
degree
of
horror
than
what
now
seize
on
Partridge
;
the
contagion
of
which
have
reach
the
post
-
boy
,
who
have
be
very
attentive
to
many
thing
that
the
other
have
utter
.
<EOS>
He
now
,
therefore
,
join
in
petition
Jones
to
return
;
say
he
firmly
believe
what
Partridge
have
just
before
say
,
that
though
the
horse
seem
to
go
on
,
they
have
not
move
a
step

the

hour

<EOS>
Jones
could
not
help
smile
in
the
midst
of
his
vexation
,
at
the
fear
of
these
poor
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
either
we
advance
,
"
say
he
,
"
towards
the
light
,
or
the
light
have
advance
towards
us
;
for
we
be
now
at
a
very
little
distance
from
them
;
but
how
can
either
of
you
be
afraid
of
a
set
of
people
who
appear
only
to
be
merry
-
making
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
merry
-
making
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Partridge
;
"
who
could
be
merry
-
making
at
this
time
of
night
,
and
in
such
a
place
,
and
such
weather
?
<EOS>
They
can
be
nothing
but
ghost
or
witch
,
or
some
evil
spirit
or
other
,
that
be
certain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
them
be
what
they
will
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
I
be
resolve
to
go
up
to
them
,
and
enquire
the
way
to
Coventry
.
<EOS>
all
witch
,
Partridge
,
be
not
such
ill
-
natured
hag
as
that
we
have
the
misfortune
to
meet
with
last

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
o
Lord
,
sir
,
"
cry
Partridge
,
"
there
be
no
know
what
humour
they
will
be
in
;
to
be
sure
it
be
always
good
to
be
civil
to
them
;
but
what
if
we
should
meet
with
something
bad
than
witch
,
with
evil
spirit
themselves
?
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
sir
,
be
advise
;
pray
,
sir
,
do
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
read
so
many
terrible
account
as
I
have
of
these
matter
,
you
would
not
be
so
fool
-
hardy
.
 
<EOS>
the
Lord
know
whither
we
have
get
already
,
or
whither
we
be
go
;
for
sure
such
darkness
be
never
see
upon
earth
,
and
I
question
whether
it
can
be
dark
in
the
other
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
put
forwards
as
fast
as
he
could
,
notwithstanding
all
these
hint
and
caution
,
and
poor
Partridge
be
oblige
to
follow
;
for
though
he
hardly
dare
to
advance
,
he
dare
still
less
to
stay
behind
by
himself
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
they
arrive
at
the
place
<EOS>
whence
the
light
and
different
noise
have
issue
.
<EOS>
this
Jones
perceive
to
be
no
other
than
a
barn
,
where
a
great
number
of
man
and
woman
be
assemble
,
and
divert
themselves
with
much
apparent
jollity
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
no
sooner
appear
before
the
great
door
of
the
barn
,
which
be
open
,
than
a
masculine
and
very
rough
voice
from
within
demand
,
who
be
there
?
 
<EOS>
to
which
Jones
gently
answer
,
a
friend
;
and
immediately
ask
the
road
to
Coventry
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
a
friend
,
"
cry
another
of
the
man
in
the
barn
,
"
you
have
well
alight
till
the
storm
be
over
"
(
for
indeed
it
be
now
more
violent
than
ever
;
)
<EOS>
"
you
be
very
welcome
to
put
up
your
horse
;
for
there
be
sufficient
room
for
him
at
the
end
of
the
barn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
obliging
,
"
return
Jones
;
"
and
I
will
accept
your
offer
for
a
few
minute
,
whilst
the
rain
continue
;
and
here
be
two
more
who
will
be
glad
of
the
same
favour
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
accord
with
more
good
-
will
than
it
be
accept
:
for
Partridge
would
rather
have
submit
to
the
utmost
inclemency
of
the
weather
than
have
trust
to
the
clemency
of
those
whom
he
take
for
hobgoblin
;
and
the
poor
post
-
boy
be
now
infect
with
the
same
apprehension
;
but
they
be
both
oblige
to
follow
the
example
of
Jones
;
the
one
because
he
durst
not
leave
his
horse
,
and
the
other
because
he
fear
nothing
so
much
as
be
leave
by
himself
.
  
<EOS>
have
this
history
be
writ
in
the
day
of
superstition
,
I
should
have
have
too
much
compassion
for
the
reader
to
have
leave
him
so
long
in
suspense
,
whether
Beelzebub
or
Satan
be
about
actually
to
appear
in
person
,
with
all
his
hellish
retinue
;
but
as
these
doctrine
be
at
present
very
unfortunate
,
and
have
<EOS>
but
few
,
if
any
believer
,
I
have
not
be
much
aware
of
convey
any
such
terror
.
<EOS>
to
say
truth
,
the
whole
furniture
of
the
infernal
region
hath
long
be
appropriate
by
the
manager
of
playhouse
,
who
seem
lately
to
have
lay
them
by
as
rubbish
,
capable
only
of
affect
the
upper
gallery
;
a
place
in
which
few
of
our
reader
ever
sit
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
though
we
do
not
suspect
raise
any
great
terror
on
this
occasion
,
we
have
reason
to
fear
some
other
apprehension
may
here
arise
in
our
reader
,
into
which
we
would
not
willingly
betray
him
;
I
mean
that
we
be
go
to
take
a
voyage
into
fairy
-
land
,
and
introduce
a
set
of
being
into
our
history
,
which
scarce
any
one
be
ever
childish
enough
to
believe
,
though
many
have
be
foolish
enough
to
spend
their
time
in
writing
and
read
their
adventure
.
  
<EOS>
to
prevent
,
therefore
,
any
such
suspicion
,
so
prejudicial
to
the
credit
of
an
historian
,
who
profess
to
draw
his
material
from
nature
only
,
we
shall
now
proceed
to
acquaint
the
reader
who
these
people
be
,
whose
sudden
appearance
have
strike
such
terror
into
Partridge
,
have
more
than
half
frighten
the
post
-
boy
,
and
have
a
little
surprize
even
Mr
Jones
himself
.
  
<EOS>
the
people
then
assemble
in
this
barn
be
no
other
than
a
company
of
Egyptians
,
or
,
as
they
be
vulgarly
call
,
gypsy
,
and
they
be
now
celebrate
the
wedding
of
one
of
their
society
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
conceive
a
happy
set
of
people
than
appear
here
to
be
meet
together
.
<EOS>
the
utmost
mirth
,
indeed
,
shew
itself
in
every
countenance
;
nor
be
their
ball
totally
void
of
all
order
and
decorum
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
have
more
than
<EOS>
a
country
assembly
be
sometimes
conduct
with
:
for
these
people
be
subject
to
a
formal
government
and
law
of
their
own
,
and
all
pay
obedience
to
one
great
magistrate
,
whom
they
call
their
king
.
  
<EOS>
great
plenty
,
likewise
,
be
nowhere
to
be
see
than
what
flourish
in
this
barn
.
<EOS>
here
be
indeed
no
nicety
nor
elegance
,
nor
do
the
keen
appetite
of
the
guest
require
any
.
<EOS>
here
be
good
store
of
bacon
,
fowl
,
and
mutton
,
to
which
every
one
present
provide
well
sauce
himself
than
the
good
and
dear
french
cook
can
prepare
.
  
<EOS>
aenea
be
not
describe
under
more
consternation
in
the
temple
of
Juno
,
  
Dum
stupet
obtutuque
haeret
defixus
in
uno
,
  
than
be
our
heroe
at
what
he
see
in
this
barn
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
look
everywhere
round
him
with
astonishment
,
a
venerable
person
approach
him
with
many
friendly
salutation
,
rather
of
too
hearty
a
kind
to
be
call
courtly
.
<EOS>
this
be
no
other
than
the
king
of
the
gypsy
himself
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
little
distinguished
in
dress
from
his
subject
,
nor
have
he
any
regalia
of
majesty
to
support
his
dignity
;
and
yet
there
seem
(
as
Mr
Jones
say
)
to
be
somewhat
in
his
air
which
denote
authority
,
and
inspire
the
beholder
with
an
idea
of
awe
and
respect
;
though
all
this
be
perhaps
imaginary
in
Jones
;
and
the
truth
may
be
,
that
such
idea
be
incident
to
power
,
and
almost
inseparable
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
somewhat
in
the
open
countenance
and
courteous
behaviour
of
Jones
which
,
be
accompany
with
much
comeliness
of
person
,
greatly
recommend
him
at
first
sight
to
every
beholder
.
<EOS>
these
be
,
perhaps
,
a
little
heightened
in
the
present
instance
,
by
that
profound
respect
which
he
pay
to
the
king
of
the
gypsy
,
the
moment
he
be
acquaint
with
his
dignity
,
and
which
be
the
sweet
to
his
gypseian
majesty
,
as
he
be
not
use
to
receive
such
homage
from
any
but
his
own
subject
.
  
<EOS>
the
king
order
a
table
to
be
spread
with
the
choicest
of
their
provision
for
his
accommodation
;
and
,
have
place
himself
at
his
right
hand
,
his
majesty
begin
to
discourse
with
our
heroe
in
the
follow
manner
:
    
"
<EOS>
Me
doubt
not
,
sir
,
but
you
have
often

some
of
my

,
who

what

for
dey
go
about
everywhere
;
but
me
fancy
<EOS>
you
imagine
not
we
be
so
considrable
body
as
we
be
;
and
may
be
you
will
be
surprize
more
when
you
hear
de
gypsy
be
as
orderly
and
well
govern
people
as
any
upon

of
de
earth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Me
have
honour

as
me
say
,
to

king
,
and
no

can
do

of

,
ne
no
more

<EOS>
how
far
me

but
dis
me
can

,
dat

<EOS>
Me
sall
no
do

of

neider
:
for
what
can
me
do

dan

to

Dey

"
about

me
can
not

to

and
make

<EOS>
and
since

"
  
<EOS>
the
king
then
proceed
to
express
some
wonder
that
there
be
no
such
punishment
as
shame
in
other
government
.
<EOS>
upon
which
Jones
assure
him
to
the
contrary
;
for
that
there
be
many
crime
for
which
shame
be
inflict
by
the
english
law

and
that
it
be
indeed
one
consequence
of
all
punishment
.
<EOS>
"
Dat
be

"
say
the

;
"
for
me
know
and

"
  
<EOS>
while
his
majesty
be
thus
discourse
with
Jones
,
a
sudden
uproar
arise
in
the
barn
,
and
as
it
seem
upon
this
occasion
:
 
<EOS>
the
courtesy
of
these
people
have
by
degree
remove
all
the
apprehension
of
Partridge
,
and
he
be
prevail
upon
not
only
to
stuff
himself
with
their
food
,
but
to
taste
some
of
their
liquor
,
which
by
degree
entirely
expel
all
fear
from
his
composition
,
and
in
its
stead
introduce
much
more
agreeable
sensation
.
  
<EOS>
a
young
female
gypsy
,
more
remarkable
for
her
wit
than
her
beauty
,
have
decoy
the
honest
fellow
aside
,
pretend
to
tell
his
fortune
.
<EOS>
now
,
when
they
be
alone
together
in
a
remote
part
of
the
barn
,
whether
it
proceed
from
the
strong
liquor
,
which
be
never
so
apt
to
inflame
inordinate
desire
as
after
moderate
fatigue
;
or
whether
the
fair
gypsy
herself
throw
aside
the
delicacy
and
decency
of
her
sex
,
and
tempt
the
youth
Partridge
with
express
solicitation
;
but
they
be
discover
in
a
very
improper
manner
by
the
husband
of
the
gypsy
,
who
,
from
jealousy
it
seem
,
have
keep
a
watchful
eye
over
his
wife
,
and
have
dog
her
to
the
place
,
where
he
find
her
in
the
arm
of
her
gallant
.
  
<EOS>
to
the
great
confusion
of
Jones
,
Partridge
be
now
hurry
before
the
king
;
who
hear
the
accusation
,
and
likewise
the
culprit
's
defence
,
which
be
indeed
very
trifling
;
for
the
poor
fellow
be
confound
by
the
plain
evidence
which
appear
against
him
,
and
have
very
little
to
say
for
himself
.
<EOS>
His
majesty
,
then
turn
towards
Jones
,
say
,
"
Sir
,
you
have
hear
what
dey
say
;
what
punishment
do
you
tink
your
man
deserve
?
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
answer
,
"
He
be
sorry
for
what
have
happen
,
and
that
Partridge
should
make
the
husband
all
the
amend
in
his
power
:
he
say
,
he
have
very
little
money
about
him
at
that
time
;
"
and
,
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
,
offer
the
fellow
a
guinea
.
<EOS>
to
which
he
immediately
answer
,
"
He
hope
his
honour
would
not
think
of
give
him
less
than
five
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
sum
,
after
some
altercation
,
be
reduce
to
two
;
and
Jones
,
have
stipulate
for
the
full
forgiveness
of
both
Partridge
and
the
wife
,
be
go
to
pay
the
money
;
when
his
majesty
,
restrain
his
hand
,
turn
to
the
witness
and
ask
him
,
"
at
what
time
he
have
discover
the
criminal
?
<EOS>
"
to
which
he
answer
,
"
that
he
have
be
desire
by
the
husband
to
watch
the
motion
of
his
wife
from
her
first
speak
to
the
stranger
,
and
that
he
have
never
lose
sight
of
her
afterwards
till
the
crime
have
be
commit
.
"
<EOS>
the
king
then
ask
,
"
if
the
husband
be
with
him
all
that
time
in
his
lurking
-
place
?
"
<EOS>
to
which
he
answer
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
His
egyptian
majesty
then
address
himself
to
the
husband
as
follow
:
"
Me
be
sorry
to
see
any
gypsy
dat
have
no
more
honour
dan
to
sell
de
honour
of
his
wife
for
money
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
de
love
for
your
wife
,
you
would
have
prevent
dis
matter
,
and
not
endeavour
to
make
her
de

Me

not

for
you

but
she
be
no
less
de
infamous
whore

"
  
<EOS>
the
gypsy
immediately
proceed
to
execute
the
sentence
,
and
leave
Jones
and
Partridge
alone
with
his
majesty
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
greatly
applaud
the
justice
of
the
sentence
:
upon
which
the
king
,
turn
to
him
,
say
,
"
Me
believe
you
be
surprize
:
for
me
suppose
you
have
ver
bad
opinion
of
my
people
;
me
suppose
you
tink
us
all
de
tieve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
confess
,
sir
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
I
have
not
hear
so
favourable
an
account
of
them
as
they
seem
to
deserve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Me
vil
tell
you
,
"
say
the
king
,
"
how
the
difference
be
between
you
and
us
.
<EOS>
My
people
rob
your
people
,
and
your
people
rob
one
anoder
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
afterwards
proceed
very
gravely
to
sing
forth
the
happiness
of
those
subject
who
live
under
such
a
magistrate
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
their
happiness
appear
to
have
be
so
compleat
,
that
we
be
aware
lest
some
advocate
for
arbitrary
power
should
hereafter
quote
the
case
of
those
people
,
as
an
instance
of
the
great
advantage
which
attend
that
government
above
all
other
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
we
will
make
a
concession
,
which
would
not
perhaps
have
be
expect
from
us
,
that
no
limited
form
of
government
be
capable
of
rise
to
the
same
degree
of
perfection
,
or
of
produce
the
same
benefit
to
society
,
with
this
.
<EOS>
mankind
have
never
be
so
happy
,
as
when
the
great
part
of
the
then
know
world
be
under
the
dominion
of
a
single
master
;
and
this
state
of
their
felicity
continue
during
the
reign
of
five
successive
prince
.
<EOS>
[
*
]
this
be
the
true
aera
of
the
golden
age
,
and
the
only
golden
age
which
ever
have
any
existence
,
unless
in
the
warm
imagination
of
the
poet
,
from
the
expulsion
from
Eden
down
to
this
day
.
    
<EOS>
[

]
<EOS>
Nerva
,
Trajan
,
Adrian
,
and
the
two
Antonini
.
  
<EOS>
in
reality
,
I
know
<EOS>
but
of
one
solid
objection
to
absolute
monarchy
.
<EOS>
the
only
defect
in
which
excellent
constitution
seem
to
be
,
the
difficulty
of
find
any
man
adequate
to
the
office
of
an
absolute
monarch
:
for
this
indispensably
require
three
quality
very
difficult
,
as
it
appear
from
history
,
to
be
find
in
princely
nature
:
first
,
a
sufficient
quantity
of
moderation
in
the
prince
,
to
be
content
with
all
the
power
which
be
possible
for
him
to
have
.
<EOS>
2ndly
,
enough
of
wisdom
to
know
his
own
happiness
.
<EOS>
and
,
3rdly
,
Goodness
sufficient
to
support
the
happiness
of
other
,
when
not
only
compatible
with
,
but
instrumental
to
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
now
if
an
absolute
monarch
,
with
all
these
great
and
rare
qualification
,
should
be
allow
capable
of
confer
the
great
good
on
society
;
it
must
be
surely
grant
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
absolute
power
,
vest
in
the
hand
of
one
who
be
deficient
in
them
all
,
be
likely
to
be
attend
with
no
less
a
degree
of
evil
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
our
own
religion
furnish
us
with
adequate
idea
of
the
blessing
,
as
well
as
curse
,
which
may
attend
absolute
power
.
<EOS>
the
picture
of
heaven
and
of
hell
will
place
a
very
lively
image
of
both
before
our
eye
;
for
though
the
prince
of
the
latter
can
have
no
power
but
what
he
originally
derive
from
the
omnipotent
Sovereign
in
the
former
,
yet
it
plainly
appear
from
scripture
that
absolute
power
in
his
infernal
dominion
be
grant
to
their
diabolical
ruler
.
<EOS>
this
be
indeed
the
only
absolute
power
which
can
by
scripture
be
derive
from
heaven
.
<EOS>
if
,
therefore
,
the
several
tyranny
upon
earth
can
prove
any
title
to
a
Divine
authority
,
it
must
be
derive
from
this
original
grant
to
the
prince
of
darkness
;
and
these
subordinate
deputation
must
consequently
come
immediately
from
him
whose
stamp
they
so
expressly
bear
.
  
<EOS>
to
conclude
,
as
the
example
of
all
age
shew
us
that
mankind
in
general
desire
power
only
to
do
harm
,
and
,
when
they
obtain
it
,
use
it
for
no
other
purpose
;
it
be
not
consonant
with
even
the
least
degree
of
prudence
to
hazard
an
alteration
,
where
our
hope
be
poorly
keep
in
countenance
by
only
two
or
three
exception
out
of
a
thousand
instance
to
alarm
our
fear
.
<EOS>
in
this
case
it
will
be
much
wise
to
submit
to
a
few
inconveniencie
arise
from
the
dispassionate
deafness
of
law
,
than
to
remedy
them
by
apply
to
the
passionate
open
ear
of
a
tyrant
.
  
<EOS>
nor
can
the
example
of
the
gypsy
,
though
possibly
they
may
have
long
be
happy
under
this
form
of
government
,
be
here
urge
;
since
we
must
remember
the
very
material
respect
in
which
they
differ
from
all
other
people
,
and
to
which
perhaps
this
their
happiness
be
entirely
owing
,
namely
,
that
they
have
no
false
honour
among
them
,
and
that
they
look
on
shame
as
the
most
grievous
punishment
in
the
world
.
    
<EOS>
a
dialogue
between
Jones
and
Partridge
.
 
<EOS>
the
honest
lover
of
liberty
will
,
we
doubt
not
,
pardon
that
long
digression
into
which
we
be
lead
at
the
close
of
the
last
chapter
,
to
prevent
our
history
from
be
apply
to
the
use
of
the
most
pernicious
doctrine
which
priestcraft
have
ever
the
wickedness
or
the
impudence
to
preach
.
  
<EOS>
We
will
now
proceed
with
Mr
Jones
,
who
,
when
the
storm
be
over
,
take
leave
of
his
egyptian
majesty
,
after
many
thank
for
his
courteous
behaviour
and
kind
entertainment
,
and
set
out
for
Coventry
;
to
which
place
(
for
it
be
still
dark
)
<EOS>
a
gypsy
be
order
to
conduct
him
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
have
,
by
reason
of
his
deviation
<EOS>
,
travel
eleven
mile
instead
of
six
,
and
most
of
those
through
very
execrable
road
,
where
no
expedition
could
have
be
make
in
quest
of
a
midwife
,
do
not
arrive
at
Coventry
till
near
twelve
.
<EOS>
nor
could
he
possibly
get
again
into
the
saddle
till
past
two
;
for
post
-
horse
be
now
not
easy
to
get
;
nor
be
the
hostler
or
post
-
boy
in
half
<EOS>
so
great
a
hurry
as
himself
,
but
choose
rather
to
imitate
the
tranquil
disposition
of
Partridge
;
who
,
be
deny
the
nourishment
of
sleep
,
take
all
opportunity
to
supply
its
place
with
every
other
kind
of
nourishment
,
and
be
never
better
pleased
than
when
he
arrive
at
an
inn
,
nor
ever
more
dissatisfied
than
when
he
be
again
force
to
leave
it
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
now
travel
post
;
we
will
follow
him
,
therefore
,
accord
to
our
custom
,
and
to
the
rule
of
Longinus
,
in
the
same
manner
.
<EOS>
from
Coventry
he
arrive
at
Daventry
,
from
Daventry
at
Stratford
,
and
from
Stratford
at
Dunstable
<EOS>
,
whither
he
come
the
next
day
a
little
after
noon
,
and
within
a
few
hour
after
Sophia
have
leave
it
;
and
though
he
be
oblige
to
stay
here
longer
than
he
wish
,
while
a
smith
,
with
great
deliberation
,
shoed
the
post
-
horse
he
be
to
ride
,
he
doubt
not
but
to
overtake
his
Sophia
before
she
should
set
out
from
St
Albans
;
at
which
place
he
conclude
,
and
very
reasonably
,
that
his
lordship
would
stop
and
dine
.
  
<EOS>
and
have
he
be
right
in
this
conjecture
<EOS>
,
he
most
probably
would
have
overtake
his
angel
at
the
aforesaid
place
;
but
unluckily
my
lord
have
appoint
a
dinner
to
be
prepare
for
him
at
his
own
house
in
London
,
and
,
in
order
to
enable
him
to
reach
that
place
in
proper
time
,
he
have
order
a
relay
of
horse
to
meet
him
at
St
Albans
.
<EOS>
when
Jones
therefore
arrive
there
,
he
be
inform
that
the
coach
-
and
-
six
have
set
out
two
hour
before
.
  
<EOS>
if
fresh
post
-
horse
have
be
now
ready
,
as
they
be
not
,
it
seem
so
apparently
impossible
to
overtake
the
coach
before
it
reach
London
,
that
Partridge
think
he
have
now
a
proper
opportunity
to
remind
his
friend
of
a
matter
which
he
seem
entirely
to
have
forget
;
what
this
be
the
reader
will
guess
,
when
we
inform
him
that
Jones
have
eat
nothing
more
than
one
poached
egg
since
he
have
leave
the
alehouse
where
he
have
first
meet
the
guide
return
from
Sophia
;
for
with
the
gypsy
he
have
feast
only
his
understanding
.
  
<EOS>
the
landlord
so
entirely
agree
with
the
opinion
of
Mr
Partridge
,
that
he
no
sooner
hear
the
latter
desire
his
friend
to
stay
and
dine
,
than
he
very
readily
put
in
his
word
,
and
retract
his
promise
before
give
of
furnish
the
horse
immediately
,
he
assure
Mr
Jones
he
would
lose
no
time
in
bespeak
a
dinner
,
which
,
he
say
,
could
be
get
ready
sooner
than
it
be
possible
to
get
the
horse
up
from
grass
,
and
to
prepare
them
for
their
journey
by
a
feed
of
corn
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
be
at
length
prevail
on
,
chiefly
by
the
latter
argument
of
the
landlord
;
and
now
a
joint
of
mutton
be
put
down
to
the
fire
.
<EOS>
while
this
be
prepare
,
Partridge
,
be
admit
into
the
same
apartment
with
his
friend
or
master
,
begin
to
harangue
in
the
follow
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
sir
,
if
ever
man
deserve
a
young
lady
,
you
deserve
young
Madam
Western
;
for
what
a
vast
quantity
of
love
must
a
man
have
,
to
be
able
to
live
upon
it
without
any
other
food
,
as
you
do
?
<EOS>
I
be
positive
I
have
eat
thirty
time
as
much
within
these
last
twenty
-
four
hour
as
your
honour
,
and
yet
I
be
almost
famished
;
for
nothing
make
a
man
so
hungry
as
travel
,
especially
in
this
cold
raw
weather
.
<EOS>
and
yet
I
can
not
tell
how
it
be
,
but
your
honour
be
seemingly
in
perfect
good
health
,
and
you
never
look
well
nor
fresh
in
your
life
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
certainly
love
that
you
live
upon
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
a
very
rich
diet
too
,
Partridge
,
"
answer
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
but
do
not
fortune
send
me
an
excellent
dainty
yesterday
?
<EOS>
dost
thou
imagine
I
can
not
live
more
than
twenty
-
four
hour
on
this
dear
pocket
-
book
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
undoubtedly
,
"
cry
Partridge
,
"
there
be
enough
in
that
pocket
-
book
to
purchase
many
a
good
meal
.
<EOS>
Fortune
send
it
to
your
honour
very
opportunely
for
present
use
,
as
your
honour
's
money
must
be
almost
out
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
?
"
answer
Jones
;
"
I
hope
you
do
not
imagine
that
I
should
be
dishonest
enough
,
even
if
it
belong
to
any
other
person
,
besides
Miss
Western
"
  
"
dishonest
!
"
<EOS>
reply
Partridge
,
"
heaven
forbid
<EOS>
I
should
wrong
your
honour
so
much
!
<EOS>
but
where
be
the
dishonesty
in
borrow
a
little
for
present
spending
,
since
you
will
be
so
well
able
to
pay
the
lady
hereafter
?
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
,
I
would
have
your
honour
pay
it
again
,
as
soon
as
it
be
convenient
,
by
all
mean
;
but
where
can
be
the
harm
in
make
use
of
it
now
<EOS>
you
want
it
?
<EOS>
indeed
,
if
it
belong
to
a
poor
body
,
it
would
be
another
thing
;
but
<EOS>
so
great
a
lady
,
to
be
sure
<EOS>
,
can
never
want
it
,
especially
now
as
she
be
along
with
a
lord
,
who
,
it
can
not
be
doubt
,
will
let
her
have
whatever
she
hath
need
of
.
<EOS>
besides
,
if
she
should
want
a
little
,
she
can
not
want
the
whole
,
therefore
I
would
give
her
a
little
;
but
I
would
be
hang
before
I
mention
the
having
find
it
at
first
,
and
before
I
get
some
money
of
my
own
;
for
London
,
I
have
hear
,
be
the
very
bad
of
place
to
be
in
without
money
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
if
I
have
not
know
to
whom
it
belong
,
I
may
have
think
it
be
the
devil
's
money
,
and
have
be
afraid
to
use
it
;
but
as
you
know
otherwise
,
and
come
honestly
by
it
<EOS>
,
it
would
be
an
affront
to
fortune
to
part
with
it
all
again
,
at
the
very
time
when
you
want
it
most
;
you
can
hardly
expect
she
should
ever
do
you
such
another
good
turn
;
for
fortuna
nunquam
perpetuo
est
bona
.
<EOS>
You
will
do
as
you
please
,
notwithstanding
all
I
say
;
but
for
my
part
,
I
would
be
hang
before
I
mention
a
word
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
by
what
I
can
see
,
Partridge
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
hang
be
a
matter
non
longe
alienum

Scaevolae

"
<EOS>
"
You
should
say
alienu

"
say
Partridge
,
 
<EOS>

I
remember
the
passage
;
it

an
example
under
communis

<EOS>
"
if
you

cry
Jones
,
"
I
find
you
do
not

I
tell
thee

in
plain
English

that

find

it

Partridge

it
have
appear
so
to
me

I
be
sure
I
scorn
any
wickedness
as
much
as
another

perhaps
you
know
better
;
and
yet
I
may
have
imagine
that
I

live
so
many
year

have
teach
school
so
long

without

it
seem

my

of

he
tell

sometimes

perhaps
,
young
gentleman
,
you
may
change
your
opinion

,
if
you
live
to
my

for
I
remember
I
think
myself
as
wise
when
I
be
a
stripling
of
one

two

twenty
as
I
be
now

I
be
sure
I
always
teach
alienus

my

read
it
so
before

"
  
<EOS>
there
be
not
many
instance
in
which
Partridge
could
provoke
Jones
,
nor
be
there
many
in
which
Partridge
himself
could
have
be
hurry
out
of
his
respect

<EOS>
Unluckily
,
however
,
they
have
both
hit
on
one
of
these
.
<EOS>
We
have
already
see
Partridge
could
not
bear
to
have
his
learning
attack
,
nor
could
Jones
bear
some
passage
or
other
in
the
foregoing
speech

<EOS>
and
now
,
look
upon
his
companion
with
a
contemptuous
and
disdainful
air
(
a
thing
not
usual
with
him
)
,
he
cry
,

see

convince

thou

"
  
<EOS>
the
sage
pedagogue
be
content
with
the
vent
which
he
have
already
give
to
his
indignation
;
and
,
as
the
vulgar
phrase
be
,
immediately
draw
in
his
horn
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
he
be
sorry
he
have
utter
anything
which
may
give
offence
,
for
that
he
have
never
intend
it
;
but
Nemo

<EOS>
as
Jones
have
the
vice
of
a
warm
disposition
,
he
be
entirely
free
from
those
of
a
cold
one

and
if
his
friend
must
have
confest
his
temper
to
have
be
a
little
too
easily
ruffle

his
enemy
must
at
the

have
confest

that
it

do
it
at
all
resemble

violent

He
instantly
accept
the
submission
of
Partridge
,
shake
him
by
the
hand
,
and
with
the
most
benign
aspect
imaginable
,
say
twenty
kind
thing

and
at
the

time
very
severely
condemn
himself
,
though
not
half
so
severely
as
he
will
most
probably
be
condemn
by
many
of
our
good

<EOS>
Partridge
be
now
highly
comfort

as
his
fear
of
have
offend
be
at

abolish

his
pride
completely
satisfied
by
Jones
have
own
himself
in
the
wrong

which
submission
he
instantly
apply
to
what
have
principally
nettle
him
,
and
repeat
in
a
muttering
voice
,
"
to
be
sure
,
sir
,
your
knowledge
may
be
superior
to
mine

some
thing

as
to
the
grammar
,
I
think
I
may
challenge
any

live

I
think
,
at

,
I
have
that
at
my
finger

end

<EOS>
if
anything
could
add
to
the
satisfaction
which
the
poor
man
now
enjoy
,
he
receive
this
addition
by
the
arrival
of
an
excellent
shoulder
of
mutton
,
that
at
this
instant
come
smoaking
to
the
table

<EOS>
on
which

have
both
plentifully
feast

they
again
mount
their
horse

set
forward
for
London

<EOS>
what
happen
to
Mr
Jones
in
his
journey
from
St
Albans
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
get
about
two
mile
beyond
Barnet
,
and
it
be
now
the
dusk
of
the
evening
,
when
a
genteel
-
looking
man
,
but
upon
a
very
shabby
horse
,
ride
up
to
Jones
,
and
ask
him
whether
he
be
go
to
London
;
to
which
Jones
answer
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
reply
,
"
I
should
be
oblige
to
you
,
sir
,
if
you
will
accept
of
my
company
;
for
it
be
very
late
,
and
I
be
a
stranger
to
the
road
.
"
<EOS>
Jones
readily
comply
with
the
request
;
and
on
they
travel
together
,
hold
that
sort
of
discourse
which
be
usual
on
such
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
of
this
,
indeed
,
robbery
be
the
principal
topic
:
upon
which
subject
the
stranger
express
great
apprehension
;
but
Jones
declare
he
have
very
little
to
lose
,
and
consequently
as
little
to
fear
.
<EOS>
here
Partridge
could
not
forbear
put
in
his
word
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
honour
,
"
say
he
,
"
may
think
it
a
little
,
but
I
be
sure
,
if
I
have
a
hundred
-
pound
bank
-
note
in
my
pocket
,
as
you
have
,
I
should
be
very
sorry
to
lose
it
;
but
,
for
my
part
,
I
never
be
less
afraid
in
my
life
;
for
we
be
four
of
us
,
and
if
we
all
stand
by
one
another
,
the
good
man
in
England
can
not
rob
us
.
<EOS>
suppose
he
should
have
a
pistol
,
he
can
kill
but
one
of
us
,
and
a
man
can
die
but
once
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
my
comfort
,
a
man
can
die
but
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
besides
the
reliance
on
superior
number
,
a
kind
of
valour
which
hath
raise
a
certain
nation
among
the
modern
to
a
high
pitch
of
glory
,
there
be
another
reason
for
the
extraordinary
courage
which
Partridge
now
discover
;
for
he
have
at
present
as
much
of
that
quality
as
be
in
the
power
of
liquor
to
bestow
.
  
<EOS>
Our
company
be
now
arrive
within
a
mile
of
Highgate
,
when
the
stranger
turn
short
upon
Jones
,
and
pull
out
a
pistol
,
demand
that
little
bank
-
note
which
Partridge
have
mention
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
be
at
first
somewhat
shocked
at
this
unexpected
demand
;
however
,
he
presently
recollect
himself
,
and
tell
the
highwayman
,
all
the
money
he
have
in
his
pocket
be
entirely
at
his
service
;
and
so
say
,
he
pull
out
upwards
of
three
guinea
,
and
offer
to
deliver
it
;
but
the
other
answer
with
an
oath
,
that
would
not
do
.
<EOS>
Jones
answer
coolly
,
he
be
very
sorry
for
it
,
and
return
the
money
into
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
the
highwayman
then
threaten
,
if
he
do
not
deliver
the
bank
-
note
that
moment
,
he
must
shoot
him
;
hold
his
pistol
at
the
same
time
very
near
to
his
breast
.
<EOS>
Jones
instantly
catch
hold
of
the
fellow
's
hand
,
which
tremble
so
that
he
could
scarce
hold
the
pistol
in
it
,
and
turn
the
muzzle
from
him
.
<EOS>
a
struggle
then
ensue
,
in
which
the
former
wrest
the
pistol
from
the
hand
of
his
antagonist
,
and
both
come
from
their
horse
on
the
ground
together
,
the
highwayman
upon
his
back
,
and
the
victorious
Jones
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
fellow
now
begin
to
implore
mercy
of
the
conqueror
:
for
,
to
say
the
truth
,
he
be
in
strength
by
no
mean
a
match
for
Jones
.
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
could
have
have
no
intention
to
shoot
you
;
for
you
will
find
the
pistol
be
not
load
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
first
robbery
I
ever
attempt
,
and
I
have
be
drive
by
distress
to
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
this
instant
,
at
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
yard
'
distance
,
lie
another
person
on
the
ground
,
roar
for
mercy
in
a
much
loud
voice
than
the
highwayman
.
<EOS>
this
be
no
other
than
Partridge
himself
,
who
,
endeavour
to
make
his
escape
from
the
engagement
,
have
be
throw
from
his
horse
,
and
lie
flat
on
his
face
,
not
daring
to
look
up
,
and
expect
every
minute
to
be
shoot
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
posture
he
lie
,
till
the
guide
,
who
be
no
otherwise
concerned
than
for
his
horse
,
have
secure
the
stumble
beast
,
come
up
to
him
,
and
tell
him
his
master
have
get
the
well
of
the
highwayman
.
  
<EOS>
partridge
leapt
up
at
this
news
,
and
run
back
to
the
place
where
Jones
stand
with
his
sword
draw
in
his
hand
to
guard
the
poor
fellow
;
which
Partridge
no
sooner
see
than
he
cry
out
,
"
kill
the
villain
,
sir
,
run
him
through
the
body
,
kill
him
this
instant
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
luckily
,
however
,
for
the
poor
wretch
,
he
have
fall
into
more
merciful
hand
;
for
Jones
have
examine
the
pistol
,
and
find
it
to
be
really
unloaded
,
begin
to
believe
all
the
man
have
tell
him
,
before
Partridge
come
up
:
namely
,
that
he
be
a
novice
in
the
trade
,
and
that
he
have
be
drive
to
it
by
the
distress
he
mention
,
the
great
indeed
imaginable
,
that
of
five
hungry
child
,
and
a
wife
lie
in
of
the
sixth
,
in
the
utmost
want
and
misery
.
<EOS>
the
truth
of
all
which
the
highwayman
most
vehemently
assert
,
and
offer
to
convince
Mr
Jones
of
it
,
if
he
would
take
the
trouble
to
go
to
his
house
,
which
be
not
above
two
mile
off
;
say
,
"
that
he
desire
no
favour
,
but
upon
condition
of
prove
all
he
have
all
alledge
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
at
first
pretend
that
he
would
take
the
fellow
at
his
word
,
and
go
with
him
,
declare
that
his
fate
should
depend
entirely
on
the
truth
of
his
story
.
<EOS>
upon
this
the
poor
fellow
immediately
express
so
much
alacrity
,
that
Jones
be
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
veracity
,
and
begin
now
to
entertain
sentiment
of
compassion
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
return
the
fellow
his
empty
pistol
,
advise
him
to
think
of
honester
mean
of
relieve
his
distress
,
and
give
him
a
couple
of
guinea
for
the
immediate
support
of
his
wife
and
his
family
;
add
,
"
he
wish
he
have
more
for
his
sake
,
for
the
hundred
pound
that
have
be
mention
be
not
his
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
Our
reader
will
probably
be
divide
in
their
opinion
concern
this
action
;
some
may
applaud
it
perhaps
as
an
act
of
extraordinary
humanity
,
while
those
of
a
more
saturnine
temper
will
consider
it
as
a
want
of
regard
to
that
justice
which
every
man
owe
his
country
.
<EOS>
Partridge
certainly
see
it
in
that
light
;
for
he
testify
much
dissatisfaction
on
the
occasion
,
quote
an
old
proverb
,
and
say
,
he
should
not
wonder
if
the
rogue
attack
them
again
before
they
reach
London
.
  
<EOS>
the
highwayman
be
full
of
expression
of
thankfulness
and
gratitude
.
<EOS>
He
actually
dropt
tear
,
or
pretend
so
to
do
.
<EOS>
He
vow
he
would
immediately
return
home
,
and
would
never
afterwards
commit
such
a
transgression
:
whether
he
keep
his
word
or
no
,
perhaps
may
appear
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
Our
traveller
have
remount
their
horse
,
arrive
in
town
without
encounter
any
new
mishap
.
<EOS>
on
the
road
much
pleasant
discourse
pass
between
Jones
and
Partridge
,
on
the
subject
of
their
last
adventure
:
in
which
Jones
exprest
a
great
compassion
for
those
highwayman
who
be
,
by
unavoidable
distress
,
drive
,
as
it
be
,
to
such
illegal
course
,
as
generally
bring
them
to
a
shameful
death
:
"
I
mean
,
"
say
he
,
"
those
only
whose
high
guilt
extend
no
farther
than
to
robbery
,
and
who
be
never
guilty
of
cruelty
nor
insult
to
any
person
,
which
be
a
circumstance
that
,
I
must
say
,
to
the
honour
of
our
country
,
distinguish
the
robber
of
England
from
those
of
all
other
nation
;
for
murder
be
,
amongst
those
,
almost
inseparably
incident
to
robbery
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
doubt
,
"
answer
Partridge
,
"
it
be
well
to
take
away
one
's
money
than
one
's
life
;
and
yet
it
be
very
hard
upon
honest
man
,
that
they
can
not
travel
about
their
business
without
be
in
danger
of
these
villain
.
<EOS>
and
to
be
sure
it
would
be
well
that
all
rogue
be
hang
out
of
the
way
,
than
that
one
honest
man
should
suffer
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
indeed
,
I
should
not
care
to
have
the
blood
of
any
of
them
on
my
own
hand
;
but
it
be
very
proper
for
the
law
to
hang
them
all
.
<EOS>
what
right
hath
any
man
to
take
sixpence
from
me
,
unless
I
give
it
him
?
<EOS>
be
there
any
honesty
in
such
a
man
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
surely
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
no
more
than
there
be
in
him
who
take
the
horse
out
of
another
man
's
stable
,
or
who
apply
to
his
own
use
the
money
which
he
find
,
when
he
know
the
right
owner
.
"
  
<EOS>
these
hint
stopt
the
mouth
of
Partridge
;
nor
do
he
open
it
again
till
Jones
,
have
throw
some
sarcastical
joke
on
his
cowardice
,
he
offer
to
excuse
himself
on
the
inequality
of
fire
-
arm
,
say
,
"
a
thousand
naked
man
be
nothing
to
one
pistol
;
for
though
it
be
true
it
will
kill
but
one
at
a
single
discharge

that
one

Thou

<EOS>
initiate

into

<EOS>

which

to

better

<EOS>
remove
that

which
dim
the
intellect
of
mortal

and
cause
them
to
adore
man
for
their

or
to
detest
them
for
their
cunning
,
in
deceive
other
,
when
they
be
,
in

,
the
object
only
of

for

<EOS>
strip
off
the
thin

from

from

the
humility
to

<EOS>
and
thou

almost
the

if

from

<EOS>
and

<EOS>
(
for
without

nothing

<EOS>
do
thou
guide
my

<EOS>
Thee

<EOS>
to

,
at

with
true
spartan
devotion
,
I
have
sacrifice
my

<EOS>
come
then
,
and
from
thy
vast

luxuriant

in

pile
up

pour
forth
the
rich

<EOS>
open
thy

thy

with

thy

thou

<EOS>
lastly
,
come
experience
,
long
conversant
with
the
wise
,
the
good
,
the

,
and
the
polite

<EOS>
nor
with
them
only
,
but
with
every
kind
of
character
,
from
the
minister
at
his

,
to
the
bailiff
in
his
spunging

from

<EOS>
from

the

however
great

hath
ever
be
a

<EOS>
come
all
these
,
and
more
,
if
possible
;
for
arduous
be
the
task
I
have
undertake
;
and
,
without
all
your
assistance
,
will
,
I
find
,
be
too
heavy
for
me
to
support
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
all
smile
on
my
labours
I
hope
still
to
bring
them
to
a
happy
conclusion
.
    
<EOS>
what
befel
Mr
Jones
on
his
arrival
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
the
learned
Dr
Misaubin
use
to
say
,
that
the
proper
direction
to
him
be
to
Dr
Misaubin
,
in
the
World
;
<EOS>
intimate
that
there
be
few
people
in
it
to
whom
his
great
reputation
be
not
know
.
<EOS>
and
,
perhaps
,
upon
a
very
nice
examination
into
the
matter
,
we
shall
find
that
this
circumstance
bear
no
inconsiderable
part
among
the
many
blessing
of
grandeur
.
  
<EOS>
the
great
happiness
of
be
know
to
posterity
,
with
the
hope
of
which
we
so
delight
ourselves
in
the
precede
chapter
,
be
the
portion
of
few
.
<EOS>
to
have
the
several
element
which
compose
our
name
,
as
Sydenham
express
it
,
repeat
a
thousand
year
hence
,
be
a
gift
beyond
the
power
of
title
and
wealth
;
and
be
scarce
to
be
purchase
,
unless
by
the
sword
and
the
pen
.
<EOS>
but
to
avoid
the
scandalous
imputation
,
while
we
yet
live
,
of
be
one
whom
nobody
know
(
a
scandal
,
by
the
bye
,
as
old
as
the
day
of
homer
<EOS>
[

)
will
always
be
the
envy
portion
of
those
,
who
have
a

title
either
to
honour
or

<EOS>
from
that
figure
,
therefore
,
which
the
irish
peer
,
who
bring
Sophia
to
town
,
hath
already
make
in
this
history
,
the
reader
will
conclude
,
doubtless
,
it
must
have
be
an
easy
matter
to
have
discover
his
house
in
London
without
know
the
particular
street
or
square
which
he
inhabit
,
since
he
must
have
be
one
whom
everybody
know
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
so
it
would
have
be
to
any
of
those
tradesman
who
be
accustomed
to
attend
the
region
of
the
great
;
for
the
door
of
the
great
be
generally
no
less
easy
to
find
than
it
be
difficult
to
get
entrance
into
them
.
<EOS>
but
Jones
,
as
well
as
Partridge
,
be
an
entire
stranger
in
London
;
and
as
he
happen
to
arrive
first
in
a
quarter
of
the
town
,
the
inhabitant
of
which
have
very
little
intercourse
with
the
householder
of
Hanover
or
Grosvenor
-
square
<EOS>
(
for
he
enter
through
Gray's
-
inn
-
lane
)
,
so
he
ramble
about
some
time
before
he
could
even
find
his
way
to
those
happy
mansion
where
fortune
segregate
from
the
vulgar
those
magnanimous
hero
,
the
descendant
of
antient
briton
,
Saxons
,
or
Danes
,
whose
ancestor
,
be
bear
in
well
day
,
by
sundry
kind
of
merit
,
have
entail
riches
and
honour
on
their
posterity
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
,
be
at
length
arrive
at
those
terrestrial
elysian
field
,
would
now
soon
have
discover
his
lordship
's
mansion
;
but
the
peer
unluckily
quit
his
former
house
when
he
go
for
Ireland
;
and
as
he
be
just
enter
into
a
new
one
,
the
fame
of
his
equipage
have
not
yet
sufficiently
blaze
in
the
neighbourhood
;
so
that
,
after
a
successless
enquiry
till
the
clock
have
strike
eleven
,
Jones
at
last
yield
to
the
advice
of
Partridge
,
and
retreat
to
the
Bull
and
Gate
in
Holborn
,
that
be
the
inn
where
he
have
first
alight
,
and
where
he
retire
to
enjoy
that
kind
of
repose
which
usually
attend
person
in
his
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
early
in
the
morning
he
again
set
forth
in
pursuit
of
Sophia
;
and
many
a
weary
step
he
take
to
no
well
purpose
than
before
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
whether
it
be
that
Fortune
relent
,
or
whether
it
be
no
longer
in
her
power
to
disappoint
him
,
he
come
into
the
very
street
which
be
honour
by
his
lordship
's
residence
;
and
,
be
direct
to
the
house
,
he
give
one
gentle
rap
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
the
porter
,
who
,
from
the
modesty
of
the
knock
,
have
conceive
no
high
idea
of
the
person
approach
,
conceive
but
little
well
from
the
appearance
of
Mr
Jones
,
who
be
dr
in
a
suit
of
fustian
,
and
have
by
his
side
the
weapon
formerly
purchase
of
the
serjeant
;
of
which
,
though
the
blade
may
be
compose
of
well
-
temper
steel
,
the
handle
be
compose
only
of
brass
,
and
that
none
of
the
bright
.
<EOS>
when
Jones
,
therefore
,
enquire
after
the
young
lady
who
have
come
to
town
with
his
lordship
,
this
fellow
answer
surlily
,
"
that
there
be
no
lady
there
.
"
<EOS>
Jones
then
desire
to
see
the
master
of
the
house
;
but
be
inform
that
his
lordship
would
see
nobody
that
morning
.
<EOS>
and
upon
grow
more
press
the
porter
say
,
"
he
have
positive
order
to
let
no
person
in
;
but
if
you
think
proper
,
"
say
he
,
"
to
leave
your
name
<EOS>
,
I
will
acquaint
his
lordship
;
and
if
you
call
another
time
you
shall
know
when
he
will
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
now
declare
,
"
that
he
have
very
particular
business
with
the
young
lady
,
and
could
not
depart
without
see
her
.
"
<EOS>
upon
which
the
porter
,
with
no
very
agreeable
voice
or
aspect
,
affirm
,
"
that
there
be
no
young
lady
in
that
house
,
and
consequently
none
could
he
see
;
"
add
,
"
sure
you
be
the
strange
man
I
ever
meet
with
,
for
you
will
not
take
an
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
often
think
that
,
by
the
particular
description
of
Cerberus
,
the
porter
of
hell
,
in
the
6th
Aeneid
,
Virgil
may
possibly
intend
to
satirize
the
porter
of
the
great
man
in
his
time
;
the
picture
,
at
least
,
resemble
those
who
have
the
honour
to
attend
at
the
door
of
our
great
man
.
<EOS>
the
porter
in
his
lodge
answer
exactly
to
Cerberus
in
his
den
,
and
,
like
him
,
must
be
appease
by
a
sop
before
access
can
be
gain
to
his
master
.
<EOS>
perhaps
Jones
may
have
see
him
in
that
light
,
and
have
recollect
the
passage
where
the
Sibyl
,
in
order
to
procure
an
entrance
for
Aeneas
,
present
the
keeper
of
the
stygian
avenue
with
such
a
sop
.
<EOS>
Jones
,
in
like
manner
,
now
begin
to
offer
a
bribe
to
the
human
Cerberus
,
which
a
footman
,
overhearing
,
instantly
advance
,
and
declare
,
"
if
Mr
Jones
would
give
him
the
sum
propose
,
he
would
conduct
him
to
the
lady
.
"
<EOS>
Jones
instantly
agree
,
and
be
forthwith
conduct
to
the
lodging
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
by
the
very
fellow
who
have
attend
the
lady
thither
the
day
before
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
more
aggravate
ill
success
than
the
near
approach
to
good
.
<EOS>
the
gamester
,
who
lose
his
party
at
piquet
by
a
single
point
,
lament
his
bad
luck
ten
time
as
much
as
he
who
never
come
within
a
prospect
of
the
game
.
<EOS>
so
in
a
lottery
,
the
proprietor
of
the
next
number
to
that
which
win
the
great
prize
be
apt
to
account
themselves
much
more
unfortunate
than
their
fellow
-
sufferer
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
these
kind
of
hairbreadth
missing
of
happiness
look
like
the
insult
of
Fortune
,
who
may
be
consider
as
thus
play
trick
with
us
,
and
wantonly
divert
herself
at
our
expense
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
,
who
more
than
once
already
have
experience
this
frolicsome
disposition
of
the
heathen
goddess
,
be
now
again
doom
to
be
tantalize
in
the
like
manner
;
for
he
arrive
at
the
door
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
about
ten
minute
after
the
departure
of
Sophia
.
<EOS>
He
now
address
himself
to
the
wait
-
woman
belong
to
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
;
who
tell
him
the
disagreeable
news
that
the
lady
be
go
,
but
could
not
tell
him
whither
;
and
the
same
answer
he
afterwards
receive
from
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
herself
.
<EOS>
for
as
that
lady
make
no
doubt
but
that
Mr
Jones
be
a
person
detach
from
her
uncle
Western
,
in
pursuit
of
his
daughter
,
so
she
be
too
generous
to
betray
her
.
  
<EOS>
though
Jones
have
never
see
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
yet
he
have
hear
that
a
cousin
of
Sophia
be
marry
to
a
gentleman
of
that
name
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
in
the
present
tumult
of
his
mind
,
never
once
recur
to
his
memory
;
but
when
the
footman
,
who
have
conduct
him
from
his
lordship
's
,
acquaint
him
with
the
great
intimacy
between
the
lady
,
and
with
their
call
each
other
cousin
,
he
then
recollect
the
story
of
the
marriage
which
he
have
formerly
hear
;
and
as
he
be
presently
convinced
that
this
be
the
same
woman
,
he
become
more
surprized
at
the
answer
which
he
have
receive
,
and
very
earnestly
desire
leave
to
wait
on
the
lady
herself
;
but
she
as
positively
refuse
him
that
honour
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
,
who
,
though
he
have
never
see
a
court
,
be
better
breed
than
most
who
frequent
it
,
be
incapable
of
any
rude
or
abrupt
behaviour
to
a
lady
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
receive
,
therefore
,
a
peremptory
denial
,
he
retire
for
the
present
,
say
to
the
waiting
-
woman
,
"
that
if
this
be
an
improper
hour
to
wait
on
her
lady
,
he
would
return
in
the
afternoon
;
and
that
he
then
hope
to
have
the
honour
of
see
her
.
"
<EOS>
the
civility
with
which
he
utter
this
,
add
to
the
great
comeliness
of
his
person
,
make
an
impression
on
the
waiting
-
woman
,
and
she
could
not
help
answer
;
"
perhaps
,
sir
,
you
may
;
"
and
,
indeed
,
she
afterwards
say
everything
to
her
mistress
,
which
she
think
most
likely
to
prevail
on
her
to
admit
a
visit
from
the
handsome
young
gentleman
;
for
so
she
call
him
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
very
shrewdly
suspect
that
Sophia
herself
be
now
with
her
cousin
,
and
be
deny
to
him
;
which
he
impute
to
her
resentment
of
what
have
happen
at
Upton
.
<EOS>
have
,
therefore
,
dispatch
Partridge
to
procure
him
lodging
,
he
remain
all
day
in
the
street
,
watch
the
door
where
he
think
his
angel
lie
conceal
;
but
no
person
do
he
see
issue
forth
,
except
a
servant
of
the
house
,
and
in
the
evening
he
return
to
pay
his
visit
to
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
which
that
good
lady
at
last
condescend
to
admit
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
certain
air
of
natural
gentility
,
which
it
be
neither
in
the
power
of
dress
to
give
,
nor
to
conceal
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jones
,
as
hath
be
before
hint
,
be
possess
of
this
in
a
very
eminent
degree
.
<EOS>
He
meet
,
therefore
,
with
a
reception
from
the
lady
somewhat
different
from
what
his
apparel
seem
to
demand
;
and
after
he
have
pay
her
his
proper
respect
,
be
desire
to
sit
down
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
will
not
,
I
believe
,
be
desirous
of
know
all
the
particular
of
this
conversation
,
which
end
very
little
to
the
satisfaction
of
poor
Jones
.
<EOS>
for
though
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
soon
discover
the
lover
(
as
all
woman
have
the
eye
of
hawk
in
those
matter
)
,
yet
she
still
think
it
be
such
a
lover
,
as
a
generous
friend
of
the
lady
should
not
betray
her
to
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
she
suspect
this
be
the
very
Mr
Blifil
,
from
whom
Sophia
have
fly
;
and
all
the
answer
which
she
artfully
draw
from
Jones
,
concern
Mr
Allworthy
's
family
,
confirm
her
in
this
opinion
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
strictly
deny
any
knowledge
concern
the
place
whither
Sophia
be
go
;
nor
could
Jones
obtain
more
than
a
permission
to
wait
on
her
again
the
next
evening
.
  
<EOS>
when
Jones
be
depart
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
communicate
her
suspicion
concern
Mr
Blifil
to
her
maid
;
who
answer
,
"
sure
,
madam
,
he
be
too
pretty
a
man
,
in
my
opinion
,
for
any
woman
in
the
world
to
run
away
from
.
<EOS>
I
have
rather
fancy
it
be
Mr
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Jones
!
"
say
the
lady
,
"
what
Jones
?
<EOS>
"
for
Sophia
have
not
give
the
least
hint
of
any
such
person
in
all
their
conversation
;
but
Mrs
Honour
have
be
much
more
communicative
,
and
have
acquaint
her
sister
Abigail
with
the
whole
history
of
Jones
,
which
this
now
again
relate
to
her
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
no
sooner
receive
this
information
,
than
she
immediately
agree
with
the
opinion
of
her
maid
;
and
,
what
be
very
unaccountable
,
see
charm
in
the
gallant
,
happy
lover
,
which
she
have
overlook
in
the
slighted
squire
.
<EOS>
"
Betty
,
"
say
she
,
"
you
be
certainly
in
the
right
:
he
be
a
very
pretty
fellow
,
and
I
do
not
wonder
that
my
cousin
's
maid
should
tell
you
so
many
woman
be
fond
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
now
<EOS>
I
do
not
inform
him
where
my
cousin
be
;
and
<EOS>
yet
,
if
he
be
so
terrible
a
rake
as
you
tell
me
,
it
be
a
pity
she
should
ever
see
him
any
more
;
for
what
but
her
ruin
can
happen
from
marry
a
rake
and
a
beggar
against
her
father
's
consent
?
<EOS>
I
protest
,
if
he
be
such
a
man
as
the
wench
describe
him
to
you
,
it
be
but
an
office
of
charity
to
keep
her
from
him
;
and
I
be
sure
it
would
be
unpardonable
in
me
to
do
otherwise
,
who
have
taste
so
bitterly
of
the
misfortune
attend
such
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
she
be
interrupt
by
the
arrival
of
a
visitor
,
which
be
no
other
than
his
lordship
;
and
as
nothing
pass
at
this
visit
either
new
or
extraordinary
,
or
any
way
material
to
this
history
,
we
shall
here
put
an
end
to
this
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
a
project
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
and
her
visit
to
Lady
Bellaston
.
 
<EOS>
when
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
retire
to
rest
,
her
thought
be
entirely
take
up
by
her
cousin
Sophia
and
Mr
Jones
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
indeed
,
a
little
offend
with
the
former
,
for
the
disingenuity
which
she
now
discover
.
<EOS>
in
which
meditation
she
have
not
long
exercise
her
imagination
before
the
follow
conceit
suggest
itself
;
that
could
she
possibly
become
the
mean
of
preserve
Sophia
from
this
man
,
and
of
restore
her
to
her
father
,
she
should
,
in
all
human
probability
,
by
so
great
a
service
to
the
family
,
reconcile
to
herself
both
her
uncle
and
her
aunt
Western
.
  
<EOS>
as
this
be
one
of
her
most
favourite
wish
,
so
the
hope
of
success
seem
so
reasonable
,
that
nothing
remain
but
to
consider
of
proper
method
to
accomplish
her
scheme
.
<EOS>
to
attempt
to
reason
the
case
with
Sophia
do
not
appear
to
her
one
of
those
method
:
for
as
Betty
have
report
from
Mrs
Honour
,
that
Sophia
have
a
violent
inclination
to
Jones
,
she
conceive
that
to
dissuade
her
from
the
match
<EOS>
be
an
endeavour
of
the
same
kind
,
as
it
would
be
very
heartily
and
earnestly
to
entreat
a
moth
not
to
fly
into
a
candle
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
reader
will
please
to
remember
that
the
acquaintance
which
Sophia
have
with
Lady
Bellaston
be
contract
at
the
house
of
Mrs
Western
,
and
must
have
grow
at
the
very
time
when
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
live
with
this
latter
lady
,
he
will
want
no
information
,
that
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
must
have
be
acquaint
with
her
likewise
.
<EOS>
They
be
,
besides
,
both
equally
her
distant
relation
.
  
<EOS>
after
much
consideration
,
therefore
,
she
resolve
to
go
early
in
the
morning
to
that
lady
,
and
endeavour
to
see
her
,
unknown
to
Sophia
,
and
to
acquaint
her
with
the
whole
affair
.
<EOS>
for
she
do
not
in
the
least
doubt
,
but
that
the
prudent
lady
,
who
have
often
ridicule
romantic
love
,
and
indiscreet
marriage
,
in
her
conversation
,
would
very
readily
concur
in
her
sentiment
concern
this
match
,
and
would
lend
her
utmost
assistance
to
prevent
it
.
  
<EOS>
this
resolution
she
accordingly
execute
;
and
the
next
morning
before
the
sun
,
she
huddle
on
her
cloath
,
and
at
a
very
unfashionable
,
unseasonable
,
unvisitable
hour
,
go
to
Lady
Bellaston
,
to
whom
she
get
access
,
without
the
least
knowledge
or
suspicion
of
Sophia
,
who
,
though
not
asleep
,
lie
at
that
time
awake
in
her
bed
,
with
honour
snore
by
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
make
many
apology
for
an
early
,
abrupt
visit
,
at
an
hour
when
,
she
say
,
"
she
should
not
have
think
of
disturb
her
ladyship
,
but
upon
business
of
the
utmost
consequence
.
"
<EOS>
She
then
open
the
whole
affair
,
tell
all
she
have
hear
from
Betty
;
and
do
not
forget
the
visit
which
Jones
have
pay
to
herself
the
precede
evening
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Bellaston
answer
with
a
smile
,
"
then
you
have
see
this
terrible
man
,
madam
;
pray
,
be
he
so
very
fine
a
figure
as
he
be
represent
?
<EOS>
for
Etoff
entertain
me
last
night
almost
two
hour
with
him
.
<EOS>
the
wench
I
believe
be
in
love
with
him
by
reputation
.
<EOS>
"
here
the
reader
will
be
apt
to
wonder
;
but
the
truth
be
,
that
Mrs
Etoff
,
who
have
the
honour
to
pin
and
unpin
the
Lady
Bellaston
,
have
receive
compleat
information
concern
the
say
Mr
Jones
,
and
have
faithfully
convey
the
same
to
her
lady
last
night
(
or
rather
that
morning
)
while
she
be
undress
;
on
which
account
she
have
be
detain
in
her
office
above
the
space
of
an
hour
and
a
half
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
indeed
,
though
generally
well
enough
pleased
with
the
narrative
of
Mrs
Etoff
at
those
season
,
give
an
extraordinary
attention
to
her
account
of
Jones
;
for
Honour
have
describe
him
as
a
very
handsome
fellow
,
and
Mrs
Etoff
,
in
her
hurry
,
add
so
much
to
the
beauty
of
his
person
to
her
report
,
that
Lady
Bellaston
begin
to
conceive
him
to
be
a
kind
of
miracle
in
nature
.
  
<EOS>
the
curiosity
which
her
woman
have
inspire
be
now
greatly
increase
by
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
who
speak
as
much
in
favour
of
the
person
of
Jones
as
she
have
before
speak
in
dispraise
of
his
birth
,
character
,
and
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
when
Lady
Bellaston
have
hear
the
whole
,
she
answer
gravely
,
"
indeed
,
madam
,
this
be
a
matter
of
great
consequence
.
<EOS>
nothing
can
certainly
be
more
commendable
than
the
part
you
act
;
and
I
shall
be
very
glad
to
have
my
share
in
the
preservation
of
a
young
lady
of
so
much
merit
,
and
for
whom
I
have
so
much
esteem
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Doth
not
your
ladyship
think
,
"
say
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
eagerly
,
"
that
it
would
be
the
good
way
to
write
immediately
to
my
uncle
,
and
acquaint
him
where
my
cousin
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
lady
ponder
a
little
upon
this
,
and
thus
answer
 
"
why
,
no
,
madam
,
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
Di
western
hath
describe
her
brother
to
me
to
be
such
a
brute
,
that
I
can
not
consent
to
put
any
woman
under
his
power
who
hath
escape
from
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
he
behave
like
a
monster
to
his
own
wife
,
for
he
be
one
of
those
wretch
who
think
they
have
a
right
to
tyrannise
over
us
,
and
from
such
I
shall
ever
esteem
it
the
cause
of
my
sex
to
rescue
any
woman
who
be
so
unfortunate
to
be
under
their
power

<EOS>
the
business
,
dear
cousin
,
will
be
only
to
keep
Miss
Western
from
see
this
young
fellow
,
till
the
good
company
,
which
she
will
have
an
opportunity
of
meeting
here

give
her
a
properer
turn

if
he
should
find
her
out

answer
the
other

your
ladyship
may
be
assure
he
will
leave
nothing
unattempted
to
come
at
her

<EOS>

but
,
madam
,
"
reply
the
lady
,
"
it
be
impossible
he
should
come
here
 
though
indeed
it
be
possible
he
may
get
some
intelligence
where
she
be
,
and
then
may
lurk
about
the
house
 
<EOS>
I
wish
therefore
I
know
his
person
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
no
way
,
madam

by
which
I
could
have
a
sight
of
him
?
<EOS>
for
,
otherwise
,
you
know
,
cousin
,
she
may
contrive
to
see
him
here
without
my
knowledge
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
answer
,
"
that
he
have
threaten
her
with
another
visit
that
afternoon
,
and
that
,
if
her
ladyship
please
to
do
her
the
honour
of
call
upon
her
then
,
she
would
hardly
fail
of
see
him
between
six
and
seven
;
and
if
he
come
earlier
she
would
,
by
some
mean
or
other
,
detain
him
till
her
ladyship
's
arrival
.
"
 
<EOS>
Lady
Bellaston
reply
,
"
She
would
come
the
moment
she
could
get
from
dinner
,
which
she
suppose
would
be
by
seven
at
farth
;
for
that
it
be
absolutely
necessary
she
should
be
acquaint
with
his
person
.
<EOS>
upon
my
word
,
madam
,
"
say
she
,
"
it
be
very
good
to
take
this
care
of
Miss
Western
;
but
common
humanity
,
as
well
as
regard
to
our
family
,
require
it
of
us
both
;
for
it
would
be
a
dreadful
match
indeed

<EOS>
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
fail
not
to
make
a
proper
return
to
the
compliment
which
Lady
Bellaston
have
bestow
on
her
cousin
,
and
,
after
some
little
immaterial
conversation
,
withdraw
;
and
,
get
as
fast
as
she
could
into
her
chair
,
unseen
by
Sophia
or
Honour
,
return
home

which
consist
of
visit

<EOS>
Mr
Jones
have
walk
within
sight
of
a
certain
door
during
the
whole
day
,
which
,
though
one
of
the
short
,
appear
to
him
to
be
one
of
the
long
in
the
whole
year

<EOS>
at
length
,
the
clock
have
strike
five

he
return
to
Mrs
Fitzpatrick

though
it
be
a
full
hour
earlier
than
the
decent
time
of
visit
,
receive
him
very
civilly
;
but
still
persist
in
her
ignorance

Sophia

<EOS>
Jones
,
in
ask
for
his
angel

have
drop
the
word
cousin

upon
which
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
say
,
"
then
,
sir
,
you
know
we
be

as
we

you
will
permit
me
the
right
of
enquire
into
the
particular
of
your
business
with
my
cousin

"
<EOS>
here
Jones
hesitate
a
good
while
,
and
at
last
answer
,
"
He
have
a
considerable
sum
of
money
of
hers
in
his
hand
,
which
he
desire
to
deliver
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
produce
the
pocket
-
book
,
and
acquaint
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
with
the
content
,
and
with
the
method
in
which
they
come
into
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
have
scarce
finish
his
story
,
when
a
most
violent
noise
shake
the
whole
house
.
<EOS>
to
attempt
to
describe
this
noise
to
those
who
have
hear
it
would
be
in
vain
;
and
to
aim
at
give
any
idea
of
it
to
those
who
have
never
hear
the
like
,
would
be
still
more
vain
:
for
it
may
be
truly
say
     
Non
acuta
     
Sic

Corybantes

<EOS>
the
priest
of

do
not
so
rattle
their
sound

<EOS>
in
short
,
a
footman
knock
,
or
rather
thunder
,
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
Jones
be
a
little
surprize
at
the
sound
,
have
never
hear
it
before
;
but
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
very
calmly
say
,
that
,
as
some
company
be
come
,
she
could
not
make
him
any
answer
now
;
but
if
he
please
to
stay
till
they
be
go
,
she
intimate
she
have
something
to
say
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
door
of
the
room
now
fly
open
,
and
,
after
push
in
her
hoop
sideway
before
her
,
enter
Lady
Bellaston
,
who
have
first
make
a
very
low
courtesy
to
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
and
as
low
a
one
to
Mr
Jones
,
be
usher
to
the
upper
end
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
We
mention
these
minute
matter
for
the
sake
of
some
country
lady
of
our
acquaintance
,
who
think
it
contrary
to
the
rule
of
modesty
to
bend
their
knee
to
a
man
.
  
<EOS>
the
company
be
hardly
well
settle
,
before
the
arrival
of
the
peer
lately
mention
,
cause
a
fresh
disturbance
,
and
a
repetition
of
ceremonial
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
over
,
the
conversation
begin
to
be
(
as
the
phrase
be
)
extremely
brilliant
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
nothing
past
in
it
which
can
be
think
material
to
this
history
,
or
,
indeed
,
very
material
in
itself
,
I
shall
omit
the
relation
;
the
rather
,
as
I
have
know
some
very
fine
polite
conversation
grow
extremely
dull
,
when
transcribe
into
book
,
or
repeat
on
the
stage
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
this
mental
repast
be
a
dainty
,
of
which
those
who
be
exclude
from
polite
assembly
must
be
content
to
remain
as
ignorant
as
they
must
of
the
several
dainty
of
french
cookery
,
which
be
serve
only
at
the
table
of
the
great
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
as
neither
of
these
be
adapt
to
every
taste
,
they
may
both
be
often
throw
away
on
the
vulgar
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Jones
be
rather
a
spectator
of
this
elegant
scene
,
than
an
actor
in
it
;
for
though
,
in
the
short
interval
before
the
peer
's
arrival
,
Lady
Bellaston
first
,
and
afterwards
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
have
address
some
of
their
discourse
to
him
;
yet
no
sooner
be
the
noble
lord
enter
,
than
he
engross
the
whole
attention
of
the
two
lady
to
himself
;
and
as
he
take
no
more
notice
of
Jones
than
if
no
such
person
have
be
present
,
unless
by
now
and
then
stare
at
him
,
the
lady
follow
his
example
.
  
<EOS>
the
company
have
now
staid
so
long
,
that
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
plainly
perceive
they
all
design
to
stay
out
each
other
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
resolve
to
rid
herself
of
Jones
,
he
be
the
visitant
to
whom
she
think
the
least
ceremony
be
due
.
<EOS>
take
therefore
an
opportunity
of
a
cessation
of
chat
,
she
address
herself
gravely
to
him
,
and
say
,
"
Sir
,
I
shall
not
possibly
be
able
to
give
you
an
answer
to
-
night
as
to
that
business
;
but
if
you
please
to
leave
word
where
I
may
send
to
you
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
"
  
Jones
have
natural
,
but
not
artificial
good
-
breeding
.
<EOS>
instead
therefore
of
communicate
the
secret
of
his
lodging
to
a
servant
,
he
acquaint
the
lady
herself
with
it
particularly
,
and
soon
after
very
ceremoniously
withdraw
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
go
than
the
great
personage
,
who
have
take
no
notice
of
him
present
,
begin
to
take
much
notice
of
him
in
his
absence
;
but
if
the
reader
hath
already
excuse
us
from
relate
the
more
brilliant
part
of
this
conversation
,
he
will
surely
be
very
ready
to
excuse
the
repetition
of
what
may
be
call
vulgar
abuse
;
though
,
perhaps
,
it
may
be
material
to
our
history
to
mention
an
observation
of
Lady
Bellaston
,
who
take
her
leave
in
a
few
minute
after
him
,
and
then
say
to
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
at
her
departure
,
"
I
be
satisfied
on
the
account
of
my
cousin
;
she
can
be
in
no
danger
from
this
fellow
.
"
  
<EOS>
Our
history
shall
follow
the
example
of
Lady
Bellaston
,
and
take
leave
of
the
present
company
,
which
be
now
reduce
to
two
person
;
between
whom
,
as
nothing
pass
,
which
in
the
least
concern
us
or
our
reader
,
we
shall
not
suffer
ourselves
to
be
divert
by
it
from
matter
which
must
seem
of
more
consequence
to
all
those
who
be
at
all
interest
in
the
affair
of
our
heroe
.
    
<EOS>
an
adventure
which
happen
to
Mr
Jones
at
his
lodging
,
with
some
account
of
a
young
gentleman
who
lodge
there
,
and
of
the
mistress
of
the
house
,
and
her
two
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
morning
,
as
early
as
it
be
decent
,
Jones
attend
at
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
's
door
,
where
he
be
answer
that
the
lady
be
not
at
home
;
an
answer
which
surprize
him
the
more
,
as
he
have
walk
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
street
from
break
of
day
;
and
if
she
have
go
out
,
he
must
have
see
her
.
<EOS>
this
answer
,
however
,
he
be
oblige
to
receive
,
and
not
only
now
,
but
to
five
several
visit
which
he
make
her
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
to
be
plain
with
the
reader
,
the
noble
peer
have
from
some
reason
or
other
,
perhaps
from
a
regard
for
the
lady
's
honour
,
insist
that
she
should
not
see
Mr
Jones
,
whom
he
look
on
as
a
scrub
,
any
more
;
and
the
lady
have
comply
in
make
that
promise
to
which
we
now
see
her
so
strictly
adhere
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
our
gentle
reader
may
possibly
have
a
well
opinion
of
the
young
gentleman
than
her
ladyship
,
and
may
even
have
some
concern
,
should
it
be
apprehend
that
,
during
this
unhappy
separation
from
Sophia
,
he
take
up
his
residence
either
at
an
inn
,
or
in
the
street
;
we
shall
now
give
an
account
of
his
lodging
,
which
be
indeed
in
a
very
reputable
house
,
and
in
a
very
good
part
of
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Jones
,
then
,
have
often
hear
Mr
Allworthy
mention
the
gentlewoman
at
whose
house
he
use
to
lodge
when
he
be
in
town
.
<EOS>
this
person
,
who
,
as
Jones
likewise
know
,
live
in
bond
-
street
,
be
the
widow
of
a
clergyman
,
and
be
leave
by
him
,
at
his
decease
,
in
possession
of
two
daughter
,
and
of
a
compleat
set
of
manuscript
sermon
.
  
<EOS>
of
these
two
daughter
,
Nancy
,
the
elder
,
be
now
arrive
at
the
age
of
seventeen
,
and
Betty
,
the
young
,
at
that
of
ten
.
  
<EOS>
Hither
Jones
have
despatch
Partridge
,
and
in
this
house
he
be
provide
with
a
room
for
himself
in
the
second
floor
,
and
with
one
for
Partridge
in
the
fourth
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
floor
be
inhabit
by
one
of
those
young
gentleman
,
who
,
in
the
last
age
,
be
call
man
of
wit
and
pleasure
about
town
,
and
properly
enough
;
for
as
man
be
usually
denominate
from
their
business
or
profession
,
so
pleasure
may
be
say
to
have
be
the
only
business
or
profession
of
those
gentleman
to
whom
fortune
have
make
all
useful
occupation
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
playhouse
,
coffeehouse
,
and
tavern
be
the
scene
of
their
rendezvous
.
<EOS>
Wit
and
humour
be
the
entertainment
of
their
loose
hour
,
and
love
be
the
business
of
their
more
serious
moment
.
<EOS>
wine
and
the
muse
conspire
to
kindle
the
bright
flame
in
their
breast
;
nor
do
they
only
admire
,
but
some
be
able
to
celebrate
the
beauty
they
admire
,
and
all
to
judge
of
the
merit
of
such
composition
.
  
<EOS>
such
,
therefore
,
be
properly
call
the
man
of
wit
and
pleasure
;
but
I
question
whether
the
same
appellation
may
,
with
the
same
propriety
,
be
give
to
those
young
gentleman
of
our
time
,
who
have
the
same
ambition
to
be
distinguish
for
part
.
<EOS>
Wit
certainly
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
.
<EOS>
to
give
them
their
due
,
they
soar
a
step
high
than
their
predecessor
,
and
may
be
call
man
of
wisdom
and
vertu
(
take
heed
you
do
not
read
virtue
)
.
<EOS>
thus
at
an
age
when
the
gentleman
above
mention
employ
their
time
in
toast
the
charm
of
a
woman
,
or
in
make
sonnet
in
her
praise
;
in
give
their
opinion
of
a
play
at
the
theatre
,
or
of
a
poem
at
Will
's
or
Button
's
;
these
gentleman
be
consider
the
method
to
bribe
a
corporation
,
or
meditate
speech
for
the
House
of
Commons
,
or
rather
for
the
magazine
.
<EOS>
but
the
science
of
gaming
be
that
which
above
all
other
employ
their
thought
.
<EOS>
these
be
the
study
of
their
graver
hour
,
while
for
their
amusement
they
have
the
vast
circle
of
connoisseurship
,
painting
,
music
,
statuary
,
and
natural
philosophy
,
or
rather
unnatural
,
which
deal
in
the
wonderful
,
and
know
nothing
of
Nature
,
except
her
monster
and
imperfection
.
  
<EOS>
when
Jones
have
spend
the
whole
day
in
vain
enquiry
after
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
he
return
at
last
disconsolate
to
his
apartment
.
<EOS>
here
,
while
he
be
vent
his
grief
in
private
,
he
hear
a
violent
uproar
below
-
stair
;
and
soon
after
a
female
voice
beg
him
for
heaven
's
sake
to
come
and
prevent
murder
.
<EOS>
Jones
,
who
be
never
backward
on
any
occasion
to
help
the
distressed
,
immediately
run
down
-
stair
;
when
step
into
the
dining
-
room
,
whence
all
the
noise
issue
,
he
behold
the
young
gentleman
of
wisdom
and
vertu
just
before
mention
,
pin
close
to
the
wall
by
his
footman
,
and
a
young
woman
stand
by
,
wring
her
hand
,
and
cry
out
,
"
He
will
be
murder
!
<EOS>
he
will
be
murder
!
"
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
the
poor
gentleman
seem
in
some
danger
of
be
choake
,
when
Jones
fly
hastily
to
his
assistance
,
and
rescue
him
,
just
as
he
be
breathe
his
last
,
from
the
unmerciful
clutch
of
the
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
though
the
fellow
have
receive
several
kick
and
cuff
from
the
little
gentleman
,
who
have
more
spirit
than
strength
,
he
have
make
it
a
kind
of
scruple
of
conscience
to
strike
his
master
,
and
would
have
content
himself
with
only
choake
him
;
but
towards
Jones
he
bear
no
such
respect
;
he
no
sooner
therefore
find
himself
a
little
roughly
handle
by
his
new
antagonist
,
than
he
give
him
one
of
those
punch
in
the
gut
which
,
though
the
spectator
at
Broughton
's
amphitheatre
have
such
exquisite
delight
in
see
them
,
convey
but
very
little
pleasure
in
the
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
the
lusty
youth
have
no
sooner
receive
this
blow
,
than
he
meditate
a
most
grateful
return
;
and
now
ensue
a
combat
between
Jones
and
the
footman
,
which
be
very
fierce
,
but
short
;
for
this
fellow
be
no
more
able
to
contend
with
Jones
than
his
master
have
before
be
to
contend
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
Fortune
,
accord
to
her
usual
custom
,
reverse
the
face
of
affair
.
<EOS>
the
former
victor
lie
breathless
on
the
ground
,
and
the
vanquish
gentleman
have
recover
breath
enough
to
thank
Mr
Jones
for
his
seasonable
assistance
;
he
receive
likewise
the
hearty
thank
of
the
young
woman
present
,
who
be
indeed
no
other
than
Miss
Nancy
,
the
eld
daughter
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
footman
,
have
now
recover
his
leg
,
shake
his
head
at
Jones
,
and
,
with
a
sagacious
look
,
cry
 
"
o
d####n
me
,
I
will
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
;
you
have
be
upon
the
stage
,
or
I
be
d
 
<EOS>
nably
mistaken
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
indeed
we
may
forgive
this
his
suspicion
;
for
such
be
the
agility
and
strength
of
our
heroe
,
that
he
be
,
perhaps
,
a
match
for
one
of
the
first
-
rate
boxer
,
and
could
,
with
great
ease
,
have
beat
all
the
muffle
[

]
graduate
of
Mr
Broughton
's
school
.
    
<EOS>
[

]
<EOS>
lest
posterity
should
be
puzzle
by
this
epithet
<EOS>
,
I
think
proper
  
to
explain
it
by
an
advertisement
which
be
publish
February
1
,
1747
.
    
<EOS>
N.B.
 
Mr
Broughton
propose
,
with
proper
assistance
,
to
open
an
  
academy
at
his
house
in
the
Haymarket
,
for
the
instruction
of
those
  
who
be
willing
to
be
initiate
in
the
mystery
of
boxing
:
where
the
  
whole
theory
and
practice
of
that
truly
british
art
,
with
all
the
  
various
stop
,
blow
,
cross
-
buttock
,
&
c.
,
incident
to
combatant
,
  
will
be
fully
teach
and
explain
;
and
that
person
of
quality
and
  
distinction
may
not
be
deter
from
enter
into
a
course
of
  
those
lecture
,
they
will
be
give
with
the
utmost
tenderness
and
  
regard
to
the
delicacy
of
the
frame
and
constitution
of
the
pupil
,
  
for
which
reason
muffle
be
provide
,
that
will
effectually
secure
  
them
from
the
inconveniency
of
black
eye
,
break
jaw
,
and
bloody
  
nose
.
  
<EOS>
the
master
,
foam
with
wrath
,
order
his
man
immediately
to
strip
,
to
which
the
latter
very
readily
agree
,
on
condition
of
receive
his
wage
.
<EOS>
this
condition
be
presently
comply
with
,
and
the
fellow
be
discharge
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
the
young
gentleman
,
whose
name
be
Nightingale
,
very
strenuously
insist
that
his
deliverer
should
take
part
of
a
bottle
of
wine
with
him
;
to
which
Jones
,
after
much
entreaty

consent

though
more
out
of
complacence
than
inclination

for
the
uneasiness
of
his
mind
fit
him
very
little
for
conversation
at
this
time
.
<EOS>
Miss
Nancy
likewise
,
who
be
the
only
female
then
in
the
house
,
<EOS>
her
mamma
and
sister
be
both
go
to
the
play
,
condescend
to
favour
them
with
her
company
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
bottle
and
glass
be
on
the
table
the
gentleman
begin
to
relate
the
occasion
of
the
precede
disturbance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
sir
,
"
say
he
to
Jones
,
"
you
will
not
from
this
accident
conclude
,
that
I
make
a
custom
of
strike
my
servant
,
for
I
assure
you
this
be
the
first
time
I
have
be
guilty
of
it
in
my
remembrance
,
and
I
have
pass
by
many
provoking
fault
in
this
very
fellow
,
before
he
could
provoke
me
to
it
;
but
when
you
hear
what
hath
happen
this
evening
,
you
will
,
I
believe
,
think
me
excusable
.
<EOS>
I
happen
to
come
home
several
hour
before
my
usual
time
,
when
I
find
four
gentleman
of
the
cloth
at
whist
by
my
fire
;
 
and
my
Hoyle
,
sir
 
my
good
Hoyle
,
which
cost
me
a
guinea
,
lie
open
on
the
table
,
with
a
quantity
of
porter
spilt
on
one
of
the
most
material
leave
of
the
whole
book
.
<EOS>
this
,
you
will
allow
,
be
provoking
;
but
I
say
nothing
till
the
rest
of
the
honest
company
be
go
,
and
then
give
the
fellow
a
gentle
rebuke
,
who
,
instead
of
express
any
concern
,
make
me
a
pert
answer
,
"
that
servant
must
have
their
diversion
as
well
as
other
people
;
that
he
be
sorry
for
the
accident
which
have
happen
to
the
book
,
but
that
several
of
his
acquaintance
have
buy
the
same
for
a
shilling
,
and
that
I
may
stop
as
much
in
his
wage
,
if
I
please
.
<EOS>
"
I
now
give
him
a
severer
reprimand
than
before
,
when
the
rascal
have
the
insolence
to
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
impute
my
early
come
home
to
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
cast
a
reflection
 
<EOS>
He
mention
the
name
of
a
young
lady
,
in
a
manner
 
in
such
a
manner
that
incense
me
beyond
all
patience
,
and
,
in
my
passion
,
I
strike
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
answer
,
"
that
he
believe
no
person
live
would
blame
him
;
for
my
part
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
confess
I
should
,
on
the
last
-
mention
provocation
,
have
do
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Our
company
have
not
sit
long
before
they
be
join
by
the
mother
and
daughter
,
at
their
return
from
the
play
.
<EOS>
and
now
they
all
spend
a
very
chearful
evening
together
;
for
all
but
Jones
be
heartily
merry
,
and
even
he
put
on
as
much
constrain
mirth
as
possible
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
half
his
natural
flow
of
animal
spirit
,
join
to
the
sweetness
of
his
temper
,
be
sufficient
to
make
a
most
amiable
companion
;
and
notwithstanding
the
heaviness
of
his
heart
,
so
agreeable
do
he
make
himself
on
the
present
occasion
,
that
,
at
their
breaking
up
,
the
young
gentleman
earnestly
desire
his
further
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Miss
Nancy
be
well
pleased
with
him
;
and
the
widow
,
quite
charm
with
her
new
lodger
,
invite
him
,
with
the
other
,
next
morning
to
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
on
his
part
be
no
less
satisfied
.
<EOS>
as
for
Miss
Nancy
,
though
a
very
little
creature
,
she
be
extremely
pretty
,
and
the
widow
have
all
the
charm
which
can
adorn
a
woman
near
fifty
.
<EOS>
as
she
be
one
of
the
most
innocent
creature
in
the
world
,
so
she
be
one
of
the
most
chearful
.
<EOS>
She
never
think
,
nor
speak
,
nor
wish
any
ill
,
and
have
constantly
that
desire
of
pleasing
,
which
may
be
call
the
happy
of
all
desire
in
this
,
that
it
scarce
ever
fail
of
attain
its
end
,
when
not
disgrace
by
affectation
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
though
her
power
be
very
small
,
she
be
in
her
heart
one
of
the
warm
friend
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
a
most
affectionate
wife
,
and
be
a
most
fond
and
tender
mother
.
<EOS>
as
our
history
doth
not
,
like
a
newspaper
,
give
great
character
to
people
who
never
be
hear
of
before
,
nor
will
ever
be
hear
of
again
,
the
reader
may
hence
conclude
,
that
this
excellent
woman
will
hereafter
appear
to
be
of
some
importance
in
our
history
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
Jones
a
little
pleased
with
the
young
gentleman
himself
,
whose
wine
he
have
be
drink
.
<EOS>
He
think
he
discern
in
him
much
good
sense
,
though
a
little
too
much
taint
with
town
-
foppery
;
but
what
recommend
him
most
to
Jones
be
some
sentiment
of
great
generosity
and
humanity
,
which
occasionally
dropt
from
him
;
and
particularly
many
expression
of
the
high
disinterestedness
in
the
affair
of
love
.
<EOS>
on
which
subject
the
young
gentleman
deliver
himself
in
a
language
which
may
have
very
well
become
an
arcadian
shepherd
of
old
,
and
which
appear
very
extraordinary
when
proceed
from
the
lip
of
a
modern
fine
gentleman
;
but
he
be
only
one
by
imitation
,
and
mean
by
nature
for
a
much
well
character
.
    
<EOS>
what
arrive
while
the
company
be
at
breakfast
,
with
some
hint
concern
the
government
of
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
Our
company
bring
together
in
the
morning
the
same
good
inclination
towards
each
other
,
with
which
they
have
separate
the
evening
before
;
but
poor
Jones
be
extremely
disconsolate
;
for
he
have
just
receive
information
from
Partridge
,
that
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
have
leave
her
lodging
,
and
that
he
could
not
learn
whither
she
be
go
.
<EOS>
this
news
highly
afflict
him
,
and
his
countenance
,
as
well
as
his
behaviour
,
in
defiance
of
all
his
endeavour
to
the
contrary
,
betray
manifest
indication
of
a
disorder
mind
.
  
<EOS>
the
discourse
turn
at
present
,
as
before
,
on
love
;
and
Mr
Nightingale
again
express
many
of
those
warm
,
generous
,
and
disintereste
sentiment
upon
this
subject
,
which
wise
and
sober
man
call
romantic
,
but
which
wise
and
sober
woman
generally
regard
in
a
well
light
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Miller
(
for
so
the
mistress
of
the
house
be
call
)
greatly
approve
these
sentiment
;
but
when
the
young
gentleman
appeal
to
Miss
Nancy
,
she
answer
only
,
"
that
she
believe
the
gentleman
who
have
speak
the
least
be
capable
of
feel
most
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
compliment
be
so
apparently
direct
to
Jones
,
that
we
should
have
be
sorry
<EOS>
have
he
pass
it
by
unregarde
.
<EOS>
He
make
her
indeed
a
very
polite
answer
,
and
conclude
with
an
oblique
hint
,
that
her
own
silence
subject
her
to
a
suspicion
of
the
same
kind
:
for
indeed
she
have
scarce
open
her
lip
either
now
or
the
last
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
,
Nanny
,
"
say
Mrs
Miller
,
"
the
gentleman
hath
make
the
observation
;
I
protest
I
be
almost
of
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
what
can
be
the
matter
with
you
,
child
?
<EOS>
I
never
see
such
an
alteration
.
<EOS>
what
be
become
of
all
your
gaiety
?
<EOS>
Would
you
think
,
sir
,
I
use
to
call
her
my
little
prattler
?
<EOS>
She
hath
not
speak
twenty
word
this
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
their
conversation
be
interrupt
by
the
entrance
of
a
maid
-
servant
,
who
bring
a
bundle
in
her
hand
,
which
,
she
say
,
"
be
deliver
by
a
porter
for
Mr
Jones
.
"
<EOS>
She
add
,
"
that
the
man
immediately
go
away
,
say
,
it
require
no
answer
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
express
some
surprize
on
this
occasion
,
and
declare
it
must
be
some
mistake
;
but
the
maid
persist
that
she
be
certain
of
the
name
,
all
the
woman
be
desirous
of
have
the
bundle
immediately
open
;
which
operation
be
at
length
perform
by
little
Betsy
,
with
the
consent
of
Mr
Jones
:
and
the
content
be
find
to
be
a
domino
,
a
mask
,
and
a
masquerade
ticket
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
be
now
more
positive
than
ever
in
assert
,
that
these
thing
must
have
be
deliver
by
mistake
;
and
Mrs
Miller
herself
express
some
doubt
,
and
say
,
"
She
know
not
what
to
think
.
<EOS>
"
but
when
Mr
Nightingale
be
ask
,
he
deliver
a
very
different
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
all
I
can
conclude
from
it
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
,
that
you
be
a
very
happy
man
;
for
I
make
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
these
be
send
you
by
some
lady
whom
you
will
have
the
happiness
of
meeting
at
the
masquerade
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
have
not
a
sufficient
degree
of
vanity
to
entertain
any
such
flattering
imagination
;
nor
do
Mrs
Miller
herself
give
much
assent
to
what
Mr
Nightingale
have
say
,
till
Miss
Nancy
have
lift
up
the
domino
,
a
card
dropt
from
the
sleeve
,
in
which
be
write
as
follow
:
         
to
MR
JONES
.
       
<EOS>
the
queen
of
the
fairy
send
you
this
;
     
Use
her
favour
not
amiss
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Miller
and
Miss
Nancy
now
both
agree
with
Mr
Nightingale
;
nay
,
Jones
himself
be
almost
persuade
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
.
<EOS>
and
as
no
other
lady
but
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
he
think
,
know
his
lodging
,
he
begin
to
flatter
himself
with
some
hope
,
that
it
come
from
her
,
and
that
he
may
possibly
see
his
Sophia
.
<EOS>
these
hope
have
surely
very
little
foundation
;
but
as
the
conduct
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
in
not
see
him
accord
to
her
promise
,
and
in
quit
her
lodging
,
have
be
very
odd
and
unaccountable
,
he
conceive
some
faint
hope
,
that
she
(
of
whom
he
have
formerly
hear
a
very
whimsical
character
)
may
possibly
intend
to
do
him
that
service
in
a
strange
manner
,
which
she
decline
do
by
more
ordinary
method
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
as
nothing
certain
could
be
conclude
from
so
odd
and
uncommon
an
incident
,
he
have
the
great
latitude
to
draw
what
imaginary
conclusion
from
it
he
please
.
<EOS>
as
his
temper
therefore
be
naturally
sanguine
,
he
indulge
it
on
this
occasion
,
and
his
imagination
work
up
a
thousand
conceit
,
to
favour
and
support
his
expectation
of
meet
his
dear
Sophia
in
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
reader
,
if
thou
hast
any
good
wish
towards
me
,
I
will
fully
repay
them
by
wish
thee
to
be
possess
of
this
sanguine
disposition
of
mind
;
since
,
after
have
read
much
and
consider
long
on
that
subject
of
happiness
which
hath
employ
so
many
great
pen
,
I
be
almost
inclined
to
fix
it
in
the
possession
of
this
temper
;
which
put
us
,
in
a
manner
,
out
of
the
reach
of
Fortune
,
and
make
us
happy
without
her
assistance
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
sensation
of
pleasure
it
give
be
much
more
constant
as
well
as
much
keen
,
than
those
which
that
blind
lady
bestow
;
nature
have
wisely
contrive
,
that
some
satiety
and
languor
should
be
annex
to
all
our
real
enjoyment
,
lest
we
should
be
so
take
up
by
them
,
as
to
be
stopt
from
further
pursuit
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
manner
of
doubt
but
that
,
in
this
light
,
we
may
see
the
imaginary
future
chancellor
just
call
to
the
bar
,
the
archbishop
in
crape
,
and
the
prime
minister
at
the
tail
of
an
opposition
,
more
truly
happy
than
those
who
be
invest
with
all
the
power
and
profit
of
those
respective
office
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Jones
have
now
determine
to
go
to
the
masquerade
that
evening
,
Mr
Nightingale
offer
to
conduct
him
thither
.
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
,
at
the
same
time
,
offer
ticket
to
Miss
Nancy
and
her
mother
;
but
the
good
woman
would
not
accept
them
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
"
she
do
not
conceive
the
harm
which
some
people
imagine
in
a
masquerade
;
but
that
such
extravagant
diversion
be
proper
only
for
person
of
quality
and
fortune
,
and
not
for
young
woman
who
be
to
get
their
living
,
and
could
,
at
best
,
hope
to
be
married
to
a
good
tradesman
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
tradesman
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Nightingale
,
"
you
shall
not
undervalue
my
Nancy
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
nobleman
upon
earth
above
her
merit
.
"
<EOS>
"
o
fie
!
<EOS>
Mr
Nightingale
,
"
answer
Mrs
Miller
,
"
you
must
not
fill
the
girl
's
head
with
such
fancy
:
but
if
it
be
her
good
luck
"
<EOS>
(
say
the
mother
with
a
simper
)
"
to
find
a
gentleman
of
your
generous
way
of
thinking
,
I
hope
she
would
make
a
well
return
to
his
generosity
than
to
give
her
mind
up
to
extravagant
pleasure
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
where
young
lady
bring
great
fortune
themselves
,
they
have
some
right
to
insist
on
spend
what
be
their
own
;
and
on
that
account
I
have
hear
the
gentleman
say
,
a
man
have
sometimes
a
well
bargain
with
a
poor
wife
,
than
with
a
rich
one
.
 
<EOS>
but
let
my
daughter
marry
whom
they
will
,
I
shall
endeavour
to
make
them
blessing
to
their
husband
:
 
<EOS>
I
beg
,
therefore
,
I
may
hear
of
no
more
masquerade
.
<EOS>
Nancy
be
,
I
be
certain
,
too
good
a
girl
to
desire
to
go
;
for
she
must
remember
when
you
carry
her
thither
last
year
,
it
almost
turn
her
head
;
and
she
do
not
return
to
herself
,
or
to
her
needle
,
in
a
month
afterwards
.
"
  
<EOS>
though
a
gentle
sigh
,
which
steal
from
the
bosom
of
Nancy
,
seem
to
argue
some
secret
disapprobation
of
these
sentiment
,
she
do
not
dare
openly
to
oppose
them
.
<EOS>
for
as
this
good
woman
have
all
the
tenderness
,
so
she
have
preserve
all
the
authority
of
a
parent
;
and
as
her
indulgence
to
the
desire
of
her
child
be
restrain
only
by
her
fear
for
their
safety
and
future
welfare
,
so
she
never
suffer
those
command
which
proceed
from
such
fear
to
be
either
disobey
or
dispute
.
<EOS>
and
this
the
young
gentleman
,
who
have
lodge
two
year
in
the
house
,
know
so
well
,
that
he
presently
acquiesce
in
the
refusal
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Nightingale
,
who
grow
every
minute
fonder
of
Jones
,
be
very
desirous
of
his
company
that
day
to
dinner
at
the
tavern
,
where
he
offer
to
introduce
him
to
some
of
his
acquaintance
;
but
Jones
beg
to
be
excuse
,
"
as
his
cloath
,
"
he
say
,
"
be
not
yet
come
to
town
.
"
  
<EOS>
to
confess
the
truth
,
Mr
Jones
be
now
in
a
situation
,
which
sometimes
happen
to
be
the
case
of
young
gentleman
of
much
well
figure
than
himself
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
have
not
one
penny
in
his
pocket
;
a
situation
in
much
great
credit
among
the
antient
philosopher
than
among
the
modern
wise
man
who
live
in
Lombard
-
street
,
or
those
who
frequent
White
's
chocolate
-
house
.
<EOS>
and
,
perhaps
,
the
great
honour
which
those
philosopher
have
ascribe
to
an
empty
pocket
may
be
one
of
the
reason
of
that
high
contempt
in
which
they
be
hold
in
the
aforesaid
street
and
chocolate
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
now
if
the
antient
opinion
,
that
man
may
live
very
comfortably
on
virtue
only
,
be
,
as
the
modern
wise
man
just
above
-
mention
pretend
to
have
discover
,
a
notorious
error
;
<EOS>
no
less
false
be
,
<EOS>
I
apprehend
,
that
position
of
some
writer
of
romance
,
that
a
man
can
live
altogether
on
love
;
for
however
delicious
repast
this
may
afford
to
some
of
our
sense
or
appetite
,
it
be
most
certain
it
can
afford
none
to
other
.
<EOS>
those
,
therefore
,
who
have
place
too
great
a
confidence
in
such
writer
,
have
experience
their
error
when
it
be
too
late
;
and
have
find
that
love
be
no
more
capable
of
allay
hunger
,
than
a
rose
be
capable
of
delight
the
ear
,
or
a
violin
of
gratify
the
smell
.
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
,
therefore
,
all
the
delicacy
which
love
have
set
before
him
,
namely
,
the
hope
of
see
Sophia
at
the
masquerade
;
on
which
,
however
ill
-
found
his
imagination
may
be
,
he
have
voluptuously
feast
during
the
whole
day
,
<EOS>
the
evening
no
sooner
come
than
Mr
Jones
begin
to
languish
for
some
food
of
a
gross
kind
.
<EOS>
partridge
discover
this
by
intuition
,
and
take
the
occasion
to
give
some
oblique
hint
concern
the
bank
-
bill
;
and
,
when
these
be
reject
with
disdain
,
he
collect
courage
enough
once
more
to
mention
a
return
to
Mr
Allworthy
.
  
<EOS>
"
partridge
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
you
can
not
see
my
fortune
in
a
more
desperate
light
than
I
see
it
myself
;
and
I
begin
heartily
to
repent
that
I
suffer
you
to
leave
a
place
where
you
be
settle
,
and
to
follow
me
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
insist
now
on
your
return
home
;
and
for
the
expense
and
trouble
which
you
have
so
kindly
put
yourself
to
on
my

all
the
cloath
I

I

<EOS>
He
speak
these
word
with
so
pathetic
an
accent
,
that
Partridge
,
among
whose
vice
ill

nature
or
hardness
of
heart
be
not

burst
into
tear

and
after
swear
he
would
not
quit
him
in
his
distress

he
begin
with
the
most
earnest
entreaty
to
urge
his
return
home

take

he
,

that
your

you
return
home

<EOS>
"
how
often
shall
I
tell
thee
,
"
answer
Jones
,
"
that
I
have
no
home

<EOS>
have
I
any
hope
that
Mr

's
door
would
be
open
to
receive
me
<EOS>
,
I
want
no
distress
to

me
 
<EOS>
nay
,
there
be
no
other
cause
upon
earth
,
which
could
detain
me
a
moment
from
fly
to
his
presence
;
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
that
I
be
for
ever
banish
from
.
<EOS>
His
last
word
be
 
<EOS>
o
,
Partridge
,
they
still
ring
in
my
ear
 
<EOS>
his
last
word
be
,
when
he
give
me
a
sum
of
money
 
<EOS>
what
it
be
<EOS>
I
know
not
,
but
<EOS>
considerable
I
be
sure
it
be
 
<EOS>
his
last
word
be
"
I
be
resolve
from
this
day
forward
,
on
no
account
to
converse
with
you
any
more
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
passion
stopt
the
mouth
of
Jones
,
as
surprize
for
a
moment
do
that
of
Partridge
;
but
he
soon
recover
the
use
of
speech
,
and
after
a
short
preface
,
in
which
he
declare
he
have
no
inquisitiveness
in
his
temper
,
enquire
what
Jones
mean
by
a
considerable
sum
 
<EOS>
he
know
not
how
much
 
<EOS>
and
what
be
become
of
the
money
.
  
<EOS>
in
both
these
point
he
now
receive
full
satisfaction
;
on
which
he
be
proceed
to
comment
,
when
he
be
interrupt
by
a
message
from
Mr
Nightingale
,
who
desire
his
master
's
company
in
his
apartment
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
two
gentleman
be
both
attire
for
the
masquerade
,
and
Mr
Nightingale
have
give
order
for
chair
to
be
send
for
,
a
circumstance
of
distress
occur
to
Jones
,
which
will
appear
very
ridiculous
to
many
of
my
reader
.
<EOS>
this
be
how
to
procure
a
shilling
;
but
if
such
reader
will
reflect
a
little
on
what
they
have
<EOS>
themselves
feel
from
the
want
of
a
thousand
pound
,
or
,
perhaps
,
of
ten
or
twenty
,
to
execute
a
favourite
scheme
,
they
will
have
a
perfect
idea
of
what
Mr
Jones
feel
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
for
this
sum
,
therefore
,
he
apply
to
Partridge
,
which
be
the
first
he
have
permit
him
to
advance
,
and
be
the
last
he
intend
that
poor
fellow
should
advance
in
his
service
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
Partridge
have
lately
make
no
offer
of
this
kind
.
<EOS>
whether
it
be
that
he
desire
to
see
the
bank
-
bill
break
in
upon
,
or
that
distress
should
prevail
on
Jones
to
return
home
,
or
from
what
other
motive
it
proceed
,
I
will
not
determine
.
    
<EOS>
contain
the
whole
humours
of
a
masquerade
.
 
<EOS>
Our
cavalier
now
arrive
at
that
temple
,
where
Heydegger
,
the
great
Arbiter
Deliciarum
,
the
great
high
-
priest
of
pleasure
,
preside
;
and
,
like
other
heathen
priest
,
impose
on
his
votary
by
the
pretended
presence
of
the
deity
,
when
in
reality
no
such
deity
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Nightingale
,
have
take
a
turn
or
two
with
his
companion
,
soon
leave
him
,
and
walk
off
with
a
female
,
say
,
"
now
you
be
here
,
sir
,
you
must
beat
about
for
your
own
game
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
begin
to
entertain
strong
hope
that
his
Sophia
be
present
;
and
these
hope
give
him
more
spirit
than
the
light
,
the
music
,
and
the
company
;
though
these
be
pretty
strong
antidote
against
the
spleen
.
<EOS>
He
now
accost
every
woman
he
see
,
whose
stature
,
shape
,
or
air
,
bear
any
resemblance
to
his
angel
.
<EOS>
to
all
of
whom
he
endeavour
to
say
something
smart
,
in
order
to
engage
an
answer
,
by
which
he
may
discover
that
voice
which
he
think
it
impossible
he
should
mistake
.
<EOS>
some
of
these
answer
by
a
question
,
in
a
squeak
voice
,
do
you
know
me
?
<EOS>
much
the
great
number
say
,
I
do
not
know
you
,
sir
,
and
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
some
call
him
an
impertinent
fellow
;
some
make
him
no
answer
at
all
;
some
say
,
indeed
I
do
not
know
your
voice
,
and
I
shall
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
;
and
many
give
him
as
kind
answer
as
he
could
wish
,
but
not
in
the
voice
he
desire
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
whilst
he
be
talk
with
one
of
these
last
(
who
be
in
the
habit
of
a
shepherdess
)
<EOS>
a
lady
in
a
domino
come
up
to
him
,
and
slap
him
on
the
shoulder
,
whisper
him
,
at
the
same
time
,
in
the
ear
,
"
if
you
talk
any
longer
with
that
trollop
,
I
will
acquaint
Miss
Western
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
no
sooner
hear
that
name
,
than
,
immediately
quit
his
former
companion
,
he
apply
to
the
domino
,
beg
and
entreat
her
to
show
him
the
lady
she
have
mention
,
if
she
be
then
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
the
mask
walk
hastily
to
the
upper
end
of
the
innermost
apartment
before
she
speak
;
and
then
,
instead
of
answer
him
,
sit
down
,
and
declare
she
be
tired
.
<EOS>
Jones
sit
down
by
her
,
and
still
persist
in
his
entreaty
;
at
last
the
lady
coldly
answer
,
"
I
imagine
Mr
Jones
have
be
a
more
discerning
lover
,
than
to
suffer
any
disguise
to
conceal
his
mistress
from
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
be
she
here
,
then
,
madam
?
"
reply
Jones
,
with
some
vehemence
.
<EOS>
upon
which
the
lady
cry
 
"
Hush
,
sir
,
you
will
be
observe
.
<EOS>
I
promise
you
,
upon
my
honour
,
Miss
Western
be
not
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
,
now
take
the
mask
by
the
hand
,
fall
to
entreat
her
in
the
most
earnest
manner
,
to
acquaint
him
where
he
may
find
Sophia
;
and
when
he
could
obtain
no
direct
answer
,
he
begin
to
upbraid
her
gently
for
have
disappoint
him
the
day
before
;
and
conclude
,
say
,
"
indeed
,
my
good
fairy
queen
,
I
know
your
majesty
very
well
,
notwithstanding
the
affected
disguise
of
your
voice
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
it
be
a
little
cruel
to
divert
yourself
at
the
expense
of
my
torment
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
mask
answer
,
"
though
you
have
so
ingeniously
discover
me
,
I
must
still
speak
in
the
same
voice
,
lest
I
should
be
know
by
other
.
<EOS>
and
do
you
think
,
<EOS>
good
sir
,
<EOS>
that
I
have
no
great
regard
for
my
cousin
,
than
to
assist
in
carry
on
an
affair
between
you
two
,
which
must
end
in
her
ruin
,
as
well
as
your
own
?
<EOS>
besides
,
I
promise
you
,
my
cousin
be
not
mad
enough
to
consent
to
her
own
destruction
,
if
you
be
so
much
her
enemy
as
to
tempt
her
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
alas
,
madam
!
"
<EOS>
say
Jones
,
"
you
little
know
my
heart
,
when
you
call
me
an
enemy
of
Sophia
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
yet
to
ruin
any
one
,
"
cry
the
other
,
"
you
will
allow
,
be
the
act
of
an
enemy
;
and
when
by
the
same
act
you
must
knowingly
and
certainly
bring
ruin
on
yourself
,
be
it
not
folly
or
madness
,
as
well
as
guilt
?
<EOS>
now
,
sir
,
my
cousin
hath
very
little
more
than
her
father
will
please
to
give
her
;
very
little
for
one
of
her
fashion
 
<EOS>
you
know
him
,
and
you
know
your
own
situation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
vow
he
have
no
such
design
on
Sophia
,
"
that
he
would
rather
suffer
the
most
violent
of
death
than
sacrifice
her
interest
to
his
desire
.
"
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
he
know
how
unworthy
he
be
of
her
,
every
way
,
that
he
have
long
ago
resolve
to
quit
all
such
aspire
thought
,
but
that
some
strange
accident
have
make
him
desirous
to
see
her
once
more
,
when
he
promise
he
would
take
leave
of
her
for
ever
.
<EOS>
no
,
madam
,
"
conclude
he
,
"
my
love
be
not
of
that
base
kind
which
seek
its
own
satisfaction
at
the
expense
of
what
be
most
dear
to
its
object
.
<EOS>
I
would
sacrifice
everything
to
the
possession
of
my
Sophia
,
but
Sophia
herself
.
"
  
<EOS>
though
the
reader
may
have
already
conceive
no
very
sublime
idea
of
the
virtue
of
the
lady
in
the
mask
;
and
though
possibly
she
may
hereafter
appear
not
to
deserve
one
of
the
first
character
of
her
sex
;
yet
,
it
be
certain
,
these
generous
sentiment
make
a
strong
impression
upon
her
,
and
greatly
add
to
the
affection
she
have
before
conceive
for
our
young
heroe
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
now
,
after
silence
of
a
few
moment
,
say
,
"
She
do
not
see
his
pretension
to
Sophia
so
much
in
the
light
of
presumption
,
as
of
imprudence
.
<EOS>
young
fellow
,
"
say
she
,
"
can
never
have
too
aspire
thought
.
<EOS>
I
love
ambition
in
a
young
man
,
and
I
would
have
you
cultivate
it
as
much
as
possible
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
may
succeed
with
those
who
be
infinitely
superior
in
fortune
;
nay
,
I
be
convince
there
be
woman
 
<EOS>
but
do
not
you
think
me
a
strange
creature
,
Mr
Jones
,
to
be
thus
give
advice
to
a
man
with
whom
I
be
so
little
acquainted
,
and
one
with
whose
behaviour
to
me
<EOS>
I
have
so
little
reason
to
be
pleased
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
Jones
begin
to
apologize
,
and
to
hope
he
have
not
offend
in
anything
he
have
say
of
her
cousin
.
 
<EOS>
to
which
the
mask
answer
,
"
<EOS>
and
be
you
so
little
versed
in
the
sex
,
to
imagine
you
can
well
affront
a
lady
more
than
by
entertain
her
with
your
passion
for
another
woman
?
<EOS>
if
the
fairy
queen
have
conceive
no
well
opinion
of
your
gallantry
,
she
would
scarce
have
appoint
you
to
meet
her
at
the
masquerade
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
have
never
less
inclination
to
an
amour
than
at
present
;
but
gallantry
to
the
lady
be
among
his
principle
of
honour
;
and
he
hold
it
as
much
incumbent
on
him
to
accept
a
challenge
to
love
,
as
if
it
have
be
a
challenge
to
fight
.
<EOS>
nay
,
his
very
love
to
Sophia
make
it
necessary
for
him
to
keep
well
with
the
lady
,
as
he
make
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
she
be
capable
of
bring
him
into
the
presence
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
He
begin
therefore
to
make
a
very
warm
answer
to
her
last
speech
,
when
a
mask
,
in
the
character
of
an
old
woman
,
join
them
.
<EOS>
this
mask
be
one
of
those
lady
who
go
to
a
masquerade
only
to
vent
ill
-
nature
,
by
tell
people
rude
truth
,
and
by
endeavour
,
as
the
phrase
be
,
to
spoil
as
much
sport
as
they
be
able
.
<EOS>
this
good
lady
,
therefore
,
have
observe
Jones
,
and
his
friend
,
whom
she
well
know
,
in
close
consultation
together
in
a
corner
of
the
room
,
conclude
she
could
nowhere
satisfy
her
spleen
better
than
by
interrupt
them
.
<EOS>
She
attack
them
,
therefore
,
and
soon
drive
them
from
their
retirement
;
nor
be
she
content
with
this
,
but
pursue
them
to
every
place
which
they
shift
to
avoid
her
;
till
Mr
Nightingale
,
see
the
distress
of
his
friend
,
at
last
relieve
him
,
and
engage
the
old
woman
in
another
pursuit
.
  
<EOS>
while
Jones
and
his
mask
be
walk
together
about
the
room
,
to
rid
themselves
of
the
teazer
,
he
observe
his
lady
speak
to
several
mask
,
with
the
same
freedom
of
acquaintance
as
if
they
have
be
bareface
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
help
express
his
surprize
at
this
;
say
,
"
sure
,
madam
,
you
must
have
infinite
discernment
,
to
know
people
in
all
disguise
.
"
<EOS>
to
which
the
lady
answer
,
"
You
can
not
conceive
anything
more
insipid
and
childish
than
a
masquerade
to
the
people
of
fashion
,
who
in
general
know
one
another
as
well
here
as
when
they
meet
in
an
assembly
or
a
drawing
-
room
;
nor
will
any
woman
of
condition
converse
with
a
person
with
whom
she
be
not
acquaint
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
generality
of
person
whom
you
see
here
may
more
properly
be
say
to
kill
time
in
this
place
than
in
any
other
;
and
generally
retire
from
hence
more
tired
than
from
the
long
sermon
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
I
begin
to
be
in
that
situation
myself
;
and
if
I
have
any
faculty
at
guess
,
you
be
not
much
better
pleased
.
<EOS>
I
protest
it
would
be
almost
charity
in
me
to
go
home
for
your
sake
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
know
but
one
charity
equal
to
it
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
and
that
be
to
suffer
me
to
wait
on
you
home
.
"
<EOS>
"
sure
,
"
answer
the
lady
,
"
you
have
a
strange
opinion
of
me
,
to
imagine
,
that
upon
such
an
acquaintance
,
I
would
let
you
into
my
door
at
this
time
of
night
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
you
impute
the
friendship
I
have
show
my
cousin
to
some
other
motive
.
<EOS>
confes
honestly
;
do
not
you
consider
this
contrived
interview
as
little
well
than
a
downright
assignation
?
<EOS>
be
you
use
,
Mr
Jones
,
to
make
these
sudden
conquest
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
use
,
madam
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
to
submit
to
such
sudden
conquest
;
but
as
you
have
take
my
heart
by
surprize
,
the
rest
of
my
body
hath
a
right
to
follow
;
so
you
must
pardon
me
if
I
resolve
to
attend
you
wherever
you
go
.
"
<EOS>
He
accompany
these
word
with
some
proper
action
;
upon
which
the
lady
,
after
a
gentle
rebuke
,
and
say
their
familiarity
would
be
observe
,
tell
him
,
"
She
be
go
to
sup
with
an
acquaintance
<EOS>
,
whither
she
hope
he
would
not
follow
her
;
for
if
you
should
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
shall
be
think
an
unaccountable
creature
,
though
my
friend
indeed
be
not
censorious
:
yet
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
not
follow
me
;
I
protest
I
shall
not
know
what
to
say
if
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
lady
presently
after
quit
the
masquerade
,
and
Jones
,
notwithstanding
the
severe
prohibition
he
have
receive
,
presume
to
attend
her
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
reduce
to
the
same
dilemma
we
have
mention
before
,
namely
,
the
want
of
a
shilling
,
and
could
not
relieve
it
by
borrow
as
before
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
walk
boldly
on
after
the
chair
in
which
his
lady
ride
,
pursue
by
a
grand
huzza
,
from
all
the
chairman
present
,
who
wisely
take
the
good
care
they
can
to
discountenance
all
walk
afoot
by
their
better
.
<EOS>
luckily
,
however
,
the
gentry
who
attend
at
the
Opera
-
house
be
too
busy
to
quit
their
station
,
and
as
the
lateness
of
the
hour
prevent
him
from
meet
many
of
their
brother
in
the
street
,
he
proceed
without
molestation
,
in
a
dress
,
which
,
at
another
season
,
would
have
certainly
raise
a
mob
at
his
heel
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
be
set
down
in
a
street
not
far
from
Hanover
-
square
,
where
the
door
be
presently
open
,
she
be
carry
in
,
and
the
gentleman
,
without
any
ceremony
,
walk
in
after
her
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
and
his
companion
be
now
together
in
a
very
well
-
furnish
and
well
-
warm
room
;
when
the
female
,
still
speak
in
her
masquerade
voice
,
say
she
be
surprize
at
her
friend
,
who
must
absolutely
have
forget
her
appointment
;
at
which
,
after
vent
much
resentment
,
she
suddenly
expr
some
apprehension
from
Jones
,
and
ask
him
what
the
world
would
think
of
their
have
be
alone
together
in
a
house
at
that
time
of
night
?
<EOS>
but
instead
of
a
direct
answer
to
so
important
a
question
,
Jones
begin
to
be
very
importunate
with
the
lady
to
unmask
;
and
at
length
have
prevail
,
there
appear
not
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
but
the
Lady
Bellaston
herself
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
tedious
to
give
the
particular
conversation
,
which
consist
of
very
common
and
ordinary
occurrence
,
and
which
last
from
two
till
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
It
be
sufficient
to
mention
all
of
it
that
be
anywise
material
to
this
history
.
<EOS>
and
this
be
a
promise
that
the
lady
would
endeavour
to
find
out
Sophia
,
and
in
a
few
day
bring
him
to
an
interview
with
her
,
on
condition
that
he
would
then
take
his
leave
of
her
.
<EOS>
when
this
be
thoroughly
settle
,
and
a
second
meeting
in
the
evening
appoint
at
the
same
place
,
they
separate
;
the
lady
return
to
her
house
,
and
Jones
to
his
lodging
.
    
<EOS>
contain
a
scene
of
distress
,
which
will
appear
very
extraordinary
to
most
of
our
reader
.
 
<EOS>
Jones
have
refresh
himself
with
a
few
hour
'
sleep
,
summon
Partridge
to
his
presence
;
and
deliver
him
a
bank
-
note
of
fifty
pound
,
order
him
to
go
and
change
it
.
<EOS>
partridge
receive
this
with
sparkling
eye
,
though
,
when
he
come
to
reflect
farther
,
it
raise
in
him
some
suspicion
not
very
advantageous
to
the
honour
of
his
master
:
to
these
the
dreadful
idea
he
have
of
the
masquerade
,
the
disguise
in
which
his
master
have
go
out
and
return
,
and
his
have
be
abroad
all
night
,
contribute
.
<EOS>
in
plain
language
,
the
only
way
he
could
possibly
find
to
account
for
the
possession
of
this
note
,
be
by
robbery
:
and
,
to
confess
the
truth
,
the
reader
,
unless
he
should
suspect
it
be
owe
to
the
generosity
of
Lady
Bellaston
,
can
hardly
imagine
any
other
.
  
<EOS>
to
clear
,
therefore
,
the
honour
of
Mr
Jones
,
and
to
do
justice
to
the
liberality
of
the
lady
,
he
have
really
receive
this
present
from
her
,
who
,
though
she
do
not
give
much
into
the
hackney
charity
of
the
age
,
such
as
build
hospital
,
&
c.
,
be
not
,
however
,
entirely
void
of
that
christian
virtue
;
and
conceive
(
very
rightly
I
think
)
that
a
young
fellow
of
merit
,
without
a
shilling
in
the
world
,
be
no
improper
object
of
this
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Jones
and
Mr
Nightingale
have
be
invite
to
dine
this
day
with
Mrs
Miller
.
<EOS>
at
the
appoint
hour
,
therefore
,
the
two
young
gentleman
,
with
the
two
girl
,
attend
in
the
parlour
,
where
they
wait
from
three
till
almost
five
before
the
good
woman
appear
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
out
of
town
to
visit
a
relation
,
of
whom
,
at
her
return
,
she
give
the
following
account
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
gentleman
,
you
will
pardon
my
making
you
wait
;
I
be
sure
if
you
know
the
occasion
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
to
see
a
cousin
of
mine
,
about
six
mile
off
,
who
now
lie
in
.
 
<EOS>
It
should
be
a
warning
to
all
person
(
say
she
,
look
at
her
daughter
)
<EOS>
how
they
marry
indiscreetly
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
happiness
in
this
world
without
a
competency
.
<EOS>
o
Nancy
!
<EOS>
how
shall
I
describe
the
wretched
condition
in
which
I
find
your
poor
cousin
?
<EOS>
she
hath
scarce
lain
in
a
week
,
and
there
be
she
,
this
dreadful
weather
,
in
a
cold
room
,
without
any
curtain
to
her
bed
,
and
not
a
bushel
of
coal
in
her
house
to
supply
her
with
fire
;
her
second
son
,
that
sweet
little
fellow
,
lie
ill
of
a
quinzy
in
the
same
bed
with
his
mother
;
for
there
be
no
other
bed
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
poor
little
Tommy
!
<EOS>
I
believe
,
Nancy
,
you
will
never
see
your
favourite
any
more
;
for
he
be
really
very
ill
.
<EOS>
the
rest
of
the
child
be
in
pretty
good
health
:
but
Molly
,
I
be
afraid
,
will
do
herself
an
injury
:
<EOS>
she
be
but
thirteen
year
old
,
Mr
Nightingale
,
and
yet
<EOS>
,
in
my
life
,
I
never
see
a
well
nurse
:
she
tend
both
her
mother
and
her
brother
;
and
,
what
be
wonderful
in
a
creature
so
young
,
she
show
all
the
chearfulness
in
the
world
to
her
mother
;
and
yet
I
see
her
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
poor
child
,
Mr
Nightingale
,
turn
about
,
and
privately
wipe
the
tear
from
her
eye
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
Mrs
Miller
be
prevent
,
by
her
own
tear
,
from
go
on
,
and
there
be
not
,
I
believe
,
a
person
present
who
do
not
accompany
her
in
them
;
at
length
she
a
little
recover
herself
,
and
proceed
thus
:
"
<EOS>
in
all
this
distress
the
mother
support
her
spirit
in
a
surprizing
manner
.
<EOS>
the
danger
of
her
son
sit
heavy
upon
her
,
and
yet
she
endeavour
as
much
as
possible
to
conceal
even
this
concern
,
on
her
husband
's
account
.
<EOS>
Her
grief
,
however
,
sometimes
get
the
well
of
all
her
endeavour
;
for
she
be
always
extravagantly
fond
of
this
boy
,
and
a
most
sensible
,
sweet
-
tempered
creature
it
be
.
<EOS>
I
protest
I
be
never
more
affected
in
my
life
than
when
I
hear
the
little
wretch
,
who
be
hardly
yet
seven
year
old
,
while
his
mother
be
wet
him
with
her
tear
,
beg
her
to
be
comfort
.
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
mamma
,
"
cry
the
child
,
"
I
shall
not
die
;
God
Almighty
,
I
be
sure
,
will
not
take
Tommy
away
;
let
heaven
be
ever
so
fine
<EOS>
a
place
,
I
have
rather
stay
here
and
starve
with
you
and
my
papa
than
go
to
it
.
"
<EOS>
pardon
me
,
gentleman
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
help
it
"
(
say
she
,
wipe
her
eye
)
,
"
such
sensibility
and
affection
in
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
perhaps
,
he
be
least
the
object
of
pity
;
for
a
day
or
two
will
,
most
probably
,
place
him
beyond
the
reach
of
all
human
evil
.
<EOS>
the
father
be
,
indeed
,
most
worthy
of
compassion
.
<EOS>
poor
man
,
his
countenance
be
the
very
picture
of
horror
,
and
he
look
like
one
rather
dead
than
alive
.
<EOS>
oh
heaven
!
<EOS>
what
a
scene
do
I
behold
at
my
first
come
into
the
room
!
<EOS>
the
good
creature
be
lie
behind
the
bolster
,
support
at
once
both
his
child
and
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
have
nothing
on
but
a
thin
waistcoat
;
for
his
coat
be
spread
over
the
bed
,
to
supply
the
want
of
blanket
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
rise
up
at
my
entrance
,
I
scarce
know
him
.
<EOS>
as
comely
a
man
,
Mr
Jones
,
within
this
fortnight
,
as
you
ever
beheld
;
Mr
Nightingale
hath
see
him
.
<EOS>
His
eye
sunk
,
his
face
pale
,
with
a
long
beard
.
<EOS>
His
body
shiver
with
cold
,
and
wear
with
hunger
too
;
for
my
cousin
say
she
can
hardly
prevail
upon
him
to
eat
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
himself
in
a
whisper
 
he
tell
me
 
I
can
not
repeat
it
 
<EOS>
he
say
he
could
not
bear
to
eat
the
bread
his
child
want
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
can
you
believe
it
,
gentleman
?
<EOS>
in
all
this
misery
his
wife
have
as
good
caudle
as
if
she
lie
in
the
midst
of
the
great
affluence
;
I
taste
it
,
and
I
scarce
ever
taste
better
.
 
<EOS>
the
mean
of
procure
her
this
<EOS>
,
he
say
,
he
believe
be
send
him
by
an
angel
from
heaven
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
he
mean
;
for
I
have
not
spirit
enough
to
ask
a
single
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
love
-
match
,
as
they
call
it
,
on
both
side
;
that
is
,
a
match
between
two
beggar
.
<EOS>
I
must
,
indeed
,
say
,
I
never
see
a
fonder
couple
;
but
what
be
their
fondness
good
for
,
but
to
torment
each
other
?
"
<EOS>
"
indeed

mamma

Nancy

I

always
look
on
my
cousin
Anderson

for
that
be
her
name

<EOS>
as
one
of
the
happy
of
woman

"
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
"
say
Mrs
Miller
,
"
the
case
at
present
be
much
otherwise
;
for
any
one
may
have
discern
that
the
tender
consideration
of
each
other
's
suffering
make
the
most
intolerable
part
of
their
calamity
,
both
to
the
husband

compare
to
which

hunger

cold

<EOS>
nay

the
very
child

the
young
,
which
be
not
two
year
old

except
,
feel
in
the
same
manner
;
for
they
be
a
most
loving
family
,
and
,
if
they
have
but
a
bare
competency
,
would
be
the
happy
people
in
the
world

"
<EOS>
"
I
never
see
the
least
sign
of
misery
at
her
house
,
"
reply
Nancy
;
"
I
be
sure
my
heart
bleed
for
what
you
now
tell
me

o
child

the

she

always
endeavour

make
the
good
of
everything

They
have
always

in
great
distress

indeed
,
this
absolute
ruin
hath
be
bring
upon
them
by
other
.
<EOS>
the
poor
man
be
bail
for
the
villain
his
brother
;
and
about
a
week
ago
,
the
very
day
before
her
lying
-
in
,
their
good
be
all
carry
away
,
and
sell
by
an
execution
.
<EOS>
He
send
a
letter
to
me
of
it
by
one
of
the
bailiff
,
which
the
villain
never
deliver
.
 
<EOS>
what
must
he
think
of
my
suffer
a
week
to
pass
before
he
hear
of
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
with
dry
eye
that
Jones
hear
this
narrative
;
when
it
be
end
he
take
Mrs
Miller
apart
with
him
into
another
room
,
and
,
deliver
her
his
purse
,
in
which
be
the
sum
of
L50
,
desire
her
to
send
as
much
of
it
as
she
think
proper
to
these
poor
people
.
<EOS>
the
look
which
Mrs
Miller
give
Jones
,
on
this
occasion
,
be
not
easy
to
be
describe
.
<EOS>
She
burst
into
a
kind
of
agony
of
transport
,
and
cry
out
 
"
good
heaven
!
<EOS>
be
there
such
a
man
in
the
world
?
"
 
<EOS>
but
recollect
herself
,
she
say
,
"
indeed
I
know
one
such
;
but
can
there
be
another
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
madam
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
there
be
many
who
have
common
humanity
;
for
to
relieve
such
distress
in
our
fellow
-
creature
,
can
hardly
be
call
more
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Miller
then
take
ten
guinea
,
which
be
the
utmost
he
could
prevail
with
her
to
accept
,
and
say
,
"
She
would
find
some
mean
of
convey
them
early
the
next
morning
;
"
add
,
"
that
she
have
herself
do
some
little
matter
for
the
poor
people
,
and
have
not
leave
them
in
quite
so
much
misery
as
she
find
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
then
return
to
the
parlour
,
where
Nightingale
express
much
concern
at
the
dreadful
situation
of
these
wretch
,
whom
indeed
he
know
;
for
he
have
see
them
more
than
once
at
Mrs
Miller
's
.
<EOS>
He
inveigh
against
the
folly
of
make
oneself
liable
for
the
debt
of
other
;
vent
many
bitter
execration
against
the
brother
;
and
conclude
with
wish
something
could
be
do
for
the
unfortunate
family
.
"
<EOS>
suppose
,
madam
<EOS>
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
should
recommend
them
to
Mr
Allworthy
?
<EOS>
or
what
think
you
of
a
collection
?
<EOS>
I
will
give
them
a
guinea
with
all
my
heart
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Miller
make
no
answer
;
and
Nancy
,
to
whom
her
mother
have
whisper
the
generosity
of
Jones
,
turn
pale
upon
the
occasion
;
though
,
if
either
of
them
be
angry
with
Nightingale
,
it
be
surely
without
reason
.
<EOS>
for
the
liberality
of
Jones
,
if
he
have
know
it
,
be
not
an
example
which
he
have
any
obligation
to
follow
;
and
there
be
thousand
who
would
not
have
contribute
a
single
halfpenny
,
as
indeed
he
do
not
in
effect
,
for
he
make
no
tender
of
anything
;
and
therefore
,
<EOS>
as
the
other
think
proper
to
make
no
demand
,
he
keep
his
money
in
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
,
in
truth
,
observe
,
and
shall
never
have
a
well
opportunity
than
at
present
to
communicate
my
observation
,
that
the
world
be
in
general
<EOS>
divide
into
two
opinion
concern
charity
,
which
be
the
very
reverse
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
one
party
seem
to
hold
,
that
all
act
of
this
kind
be
to
be
esteem
as
voluntary
gift
,
and
,
however
little
you
give
(
if
indeed
no
more
than
your
good
wish
)
,
you
acquire
a
great
degree
of
merit
in
so
do
.
<EOS>
other
,
on
the
contrary
,
appear
to
be
as
firmly
persuaded
,
that
beneficence
be
a
positive
duty
,
and
that
whenever
the
rich
fall
greatly
short
of
their
ability
in
relieve
the
distress
of
the
poor
,
their
pitiful
largesse
be
so
far
from
be
meritorious
,
that
they
have
only
perform
their
duty
by
half
,
and
be
in
some
sense
more
contemptible
than
those
who
have
entirely
neglect
it
.
  
<EOS>
to
reconcile
these
different
opinion
be
not
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
I
shall
only
add
,
that
the
giver
be
generally
of
the
former
sentiment
,
and
the
receiver
be
almost
universally
inclined
to
the
latter
.
    
<EOS>
which
treat
of
matter
of
a
very
different
kind
from
those
in
the
precede
chapter
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
evening
Jones
meet
his
lady
again
,
and
a
long
conversation
again
ensue
between
them
:
but
as
it
consist
only
of
the
same
ordinary
occurrence
as
before
,
we
shall
avoid
mention
particular
,
which
we
despair
of
render
agreeable
to
the
reader
;
unless
he
be
one
whose
devotion
to
the
fair
sex
,
like
that
of
the
papist
to
their
saint
,
want
to
be
raise
by
the
help
of
picture
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
so
far
from
desire
to
exhibit
such
picture
to
the
public
,
that
I
would
wish
to
draw
a
curtain
over
those
that
have
be
lately
set
forth
in
certain
french
novel
;
very
bungle
copy
of
which
have
be
present
us
here
under
the
name
of
translation
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
grow
still
more
and
more
impatient
to
see
Sophia
;
and
finding
,
after
repeat
interview
with
Lady
Bellaston
,
no
likelihood
of
obtain
this
by
her
mean
(
for
,
on
the
contrary
,
the
lady
begin
to
treat
even
the
mention
of
the
name
of
Sophia
with
resentment
)
,
he
resolve
to
try
some
other
method
.
<EOS>
He
make
no
doubt
but
that
Lady
Bellaston
know
where
his
angel
be
,
so
he
think
it
most
likely
that
some
of
her
servant
should
be
acquaint
with
the
same
secret
.
<EOS>
partridge
therefore
be
employ
to
get
acquaint
with
those
servant
,
in
order
to
fish
this
secret
out
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
few
situation
can
be
imagine
more
uneasy
than
that
to
which
his
poor
master
be
at
present
reduce
;
for
besides
the
difficulty
he
meet
with
in
discover
Sophia
,
besides
the
fear
he
have
of
have
disoblige
her
,
and
the
assurance
he
have
receive
from
Lady
Bellaston
of
the
resolution
which
Sophia
have
take
against
him
,
and
of
her
have
purposely
conceal
herself
from
him
,
which
he
have
sufficient
reason
to
believe
may
be
true
;
he
have
still
a
difficulty
to
combat
which
it
be
not
in
the
power
of
his
mistress
to
remove
,
however
kind
her
inclination
may
have
be
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
exposing
of
her
to
be
disinherit
of
all
her
father
's
estate
,
the
almost
inevitable
consequence
of
their
come
together
without
a
consent
,
which
he
have
no
hope
of
ever
obtain
.
  
<EOS>
add
to
all
these
the
many
obligation
which
Lady
Bellaston
,
whose
violent
fondness
we
can
no
longer
conceal
,
have
heap
upon
him
;
so
that
by
her
mean
he
be
now
become
one
of
the
best
-
dress
man
about
town
;
and
be
not
only
relieve
from
those
ridiculous
distress
we
have
before
mention
,
but
be
actually
raise
to
a
state
of
affluence
beyond
what
he
have
ever
know
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
though
there
be
many
gentleman
who
very
well
reconcile
it
to
their
conscience
to
possess
themselves
of
the
whole
fortune
of
a
woman
,
without
make
her
any
kind
of
return
;
yet
to
a
mind
,
the
proprietor
of
which
doth
not
deserve
to
be
hang
,
nothing
be
,
I
believe
,
more
irksome
than
to
support
love
with
gratitude
only
;
especially
where
inclination
pull
the
heart
a
contrary
way
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
unhappy
case
of
Jones
;
for
though
the
virtuous
love
he
bear
to
Sophia
,
and
which
leave
very
little
affection
for
any
other
woman
,
have
be
entirely
out
of
the
question
,
he
could
never
have
be
able
to
have
make
any
adequate
return
to
the
generous
passion
of
this
lady
,
who
have
indeed
be
once
an
object
of
desire
,
but
be
now
enter
at
least
into
the
autumn
of
life
,
though
she
wear
all
the
gaiety
of
youth
,
both
in
her
dress
and
manner
;
nay
,
she
contrive
still
to
maintain
the
rose
in
her
cheek
;
but
these
,
like
flower
force
out
of
season
by
art
,
have
none
of
that
lively
bloom
freshness
with
which
Nature
,
at
the
proper
time
,
bedeck
her
own
production
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
besides
,
a
certain
imperfection
,
which
render
some
flower
,
though
very
beautiful
to
the
eye
,
very
improper
to
be
place
in
a
wilderness
of
sweet
,
and
what
above
all
other
be
most
disagreeable
to
the
breath
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
though
Jones
see
all
these
discouragement
on
the
one
side
,
he
feel
his
obligation
full
as
strongly
on
the
other
;
nor
do
he
less
plainly
discern
<EOS>
the
ardent
passion
whence
those
obligation
proceed
<EOS>
,
the
extreme
violence
of
which
if
he
fail
to
equal
,
he
well
know
the
lady
would
think
him
ungrateful
;
and
,
what
be
bad
,
he
would
have
think
himself
so
.
<EOS>
He
know
the
tacit
consideration
upon
which
all
her
favour
be
confer
;
and
as
his
necessity
oblige
him
to
accept
them
,
so
his
honour
,
he
conclude
,
force
him
to
pay
the
price
.
<EOS>
this
therefore
he
resolve
to
do
,
whatever
misery
it
cost
him
,
and
to
devote
himself
to
her
,
from
that
great
principle
of
justice
,
by
which
the
law
of
some
country
oblige
a
debtor
,
who
be
no
otherwise
capable
of
discharge
his
debt
,
to
become
the
slave
of
his
creditor
.
  
<EOS>
while
he
be
meditate
on
these
matter
,
he
receive
the
follow
note
from
the
lady
:
      
<EOS>
"
a
very
foolish
,
but
a
very
perverse
accident
hath
happen
since
  
our
last
meeting
,
which
make
it
improper
I
should
see
you
any
more
  
at
the
usual
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
if
possible
,
contrive
some
other
place
  
by
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
adieu
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
disappointment
,
perhaps
,
the
reader
may
conclude
be
not
very
great
;
but
if
it
be
,
he
be
quickly
relieve
;
for
in
less
than
an
hour
afterwards
another
note
be
bring
him
from
the
same
hand
,
which
contain
as
follow
:
      
<EOS>
"
I
have
alter
my
mind
since
I
write
;
a
change
which
,
if
you
be
no
  
stranger
to
the
tender
of
all
passion
,
you
will
not
wonder
at
.
<EOS>
I
  
be
now
resolve
to
see
you
this
evening
at
my
own
house
,
whatever
  
may
be
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
come
to
me
exactly
at
seven
;
I
dine
abroad
,
  
but
will
be
at
home
by
that
time
.
<EOS>
a
day
,
I
find
,
to
those
that
  
sincerely
love
,
seem
long
than
I
imagine
.
    
<EOS>
"
if
you
should
accidentally
be
a
few
moment
before
me
,
bid
them
  
show
you
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
to
confess
the
truth
,
Jones
be
less
pleased
with
this
last
epistle
than
he
have
be
with
the
former
,
as
he
be
prevent
by
it
from
comply
with
the
earnest
entreaty
of
Mr
Nightingale
,
with
whom
he
have
now
contract
much
intimacy
and
friendship
.
<EOS>
these
entreaty
be
to
go
with
that
young
gentleman
and
his
company
to
a
new
play
,
which
be
to
be
act
that
evening
,
and
which
a
very
large
party
have
agree
to
damn
,
from
some
dislike
they
have
take
to
the
author
,
who
be
a
friend
to
one
of
Mr
Nightingale
's
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
and
this
sort
of
fun
,
our
heroe
,
we
be
ashamed
to
confess
,
would
willingly
have
prefer
to
the
above
kind
appointment
;
but
his
honour
get
the
well
of
his
inclination
.
  
<EOS>
before
we
attend
him
to
this
intended
interview
with
the
lady
,
we
think
proper
to
account
for
both
the
precede
note
,
as
the
reader
may
possibly
be
not
a
little
surprize
at
the
imprudence
of
Lady
Bellaston
,
in
bring
her
lover
to
the
very
house
where
her
rival
be
lodge
.
  
<EOS>
first
,
then
,
the
mistress
of
the
house
where
these
lover
have
hitherto
meet
,
and
who
have
be
for
some
year
a
pensioner
to
that
lady
,
be
now
become
a
methodist
,
and
have
that
very
morning
wait
upon
her
ladyship
,
and
after
rebuke
her
very
severely
for
her
past
life
,
have
positively
declare
that
she
would
,
on
no
account
,
be
instrumental
in
carry
on
any
of
her
affair
for
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
the
hurry
of
spirit
into
which
this
accident
throw
the
lady
make
her
despair
of
possibly
find
any
other
convenience
to
meet
Jones
that
evening
;
but
as
she
begin
a
little
to
recover
from
her
uneasiness
at
the
disappointment
,
she
set
her
thought
to
work
,
when
luckily
it
come
into
her
head
to
propose
to
Sophia
to
go
to
the
play
,
which
be
immediately
consent
to
,
and
a
proper
lady
provide
for
her
companion
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Honour
be
likewise
despatch
with
Mrs
Etoff
on
the
same
errand
of
pleasure
;
and
thus
her
own
house
be
leave
free
for
the
safe
reception
of
Mr
Jones
,
with
whom
she
promise
herself
two
or
three
hour
of
uninterrupted
conversation
after
her
return
from
the
place
where
she
dine
,
which
be
at
a
friend
's
house
in
a
pretty
distant
part
of
the
town
,
near
her
old
place
of
assignation
,
where
she
have
engage
herself
before
she
be
well
apprize
of
the
revolution
that
have
happen
in
the
mind
and
moral
of
her
late
confidante
.
    
<EOS>
a
chapter
which
,
though
short
,
may
draw
tear
from
some
eye
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jones
be
just
dress
to
wait
on
Lady
Bellaston
,
when
Mrs
Miller
rap
at
his
door
;
and
,
be
admit
,
very
earnestly
desire
his
company
below
-
stair
,
to
drink
tea
in
the
parlour
.
  
<EOS>
upon
his
entrance
into
the
room
,
she
presently
introduce
a
person
to
him
,
say
,
"
this
,
sir
,
be
my
cousin
,
who
hath
be
so
greatly
beholden
to
your
goodness
,
for
which
he
beg
to
return
you
his
sincere
thank
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
man
have
scarce
enter
upon
that
speech
which
Mrs
Miller
have
so
kindly
preface
,
when
both
Jones
and
he
,
look
stedfastly
at
each
other
,
show
at
once
the
utmost
token
of
surprize
.
<EOS>
the
voice
of
the
latter
begin
instantly
to
faulter
;
and
,
instead
of
finish
his
speech
,
he
sink
down
into
a
chair
,
cry
,
"
It
be
so
<EOS>
,
I
be
convince
it
be
so
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
bless
me
!
<EOS>
what
be
the
meaning
of
this
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Mrs
Miller
;
<EOS>
"
you
be
not
ill
,
I
hope
,

I
suppose

that
he
would
not

affair
of
the
robbery

any
person

indeed

what

my
feeling
when
I
reflect
to
whom
I
owe

capable

express
their
gratitude
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
sir
,
the
little
heart

"
  
<EOS>
here
Jones
attempt
to
prevent
the
poor
man
from
proceed
;
but
indeed
the
overflowing
of
his
own
heart
would
of
itself
have
stop
his
word
.
<EOS>
and
now
Mrs
Miller
likewise
begin
to
pour
forth
thanksgiving
,
as
well
in
her
own
name
,
as
in
that
of
her
cousin
,
and
conclude
with
say
,
"
She
doubt
not
but
such
goodness
would
meet
a
glorious
reward
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
answer
,
"
He
have
be
sufficiently
reward
already
.
<EOS>
Your
cousin
's
account
,
madam
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
hath
give
me
a
sensation
more
pleasing
than
I
have
ever
know
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
a
wretch
who
be
unmoved
at
hear
such
a
story
;
how
transport
then
must
be
the
thought
of
have
happily
act
a
part
in
this
scene
!
<EOS>
if
there
be
man
who
can
not
feel
the
delight
of
give
happiness
to
other
,
I
sincerely
pity
them
,
as
they
be
incapable
of
taste
what
be
,
in
my
opinion
,
a
great
honour
,
a
high
interest
,
and
a
sweet
pleasure
than
the
ambitious
,
the
avaricious
,
or
the
voluptuous
man
can
ever
obtain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
hour
of
appointment
be
now
come
,
Jones
be
force
to
take
a
hasty
leave
,
but
not
before
he
have
heartily
shake
his
friend
by
the
hand
,
and
desire
to
see
him
again
as
soon
as
possible
;
promise
that
he
would
himself
take
the
first
opportunity
of
visit
him
at
his
own
house
.
<EOS>
He
then
stept
into
his
chair
,
and
proceed
to
Lady
Bellaston
's
,
greatly
exult
in
the
happiness
which
he
have
procure
to
this
poor
family
;
nor
could
he
forbear
reflect
,
without
horror
,
on
the
dreadful
consequence
which
must
have
attend
them
,
have
he
listen
rather
to
the
voice
of
strict
justice
than
to
that
of
mercy
,
when
he
be
attack
on
the
high
road
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Miller
sing
forth
the
praise
of
Jones
during
the
whole
evening
,
in
which
Mr
Anderson
,
while
he
stay
,
so
passionately
accompany
her
,
that
he
be
often
on
the
very
point
of
mention
the
circumstance
of
the
robbery
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
luckily
recollect
himself
,
and
avoid
an
indiscretion
which
would
have
be
so
much
the
great
,
as
he
know
Mrs
Miller
to
be
extremely
strict
and
nice
in
her
principle
.
<EOS>
He
be
likewise
well
apprize
of
the
loquacity
of
this
lady
;
and
yet
such
be
his
gratitude
,
that
it
have
almost
get
the
well
both
of
discretion
and
shame
,
and
make
him
publish
that
which
would
have
defame
his
own
character
,
rather
than
omit
any
circumstance
which
may
do
the
full
honour
to
his
benefactor
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
the
reader
will
be
surprize
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jones
be
rather
early
than
the
time
appoint
,
and
earlier
than
the
lady
;
whose
arrival
be
hinder
,
not
only
by
the
distance
of
the
place
where
she
dine
,
but
by
some
other
cross
accident
very
vexatious
to
one
in
her
situation
of
mind
.
<EOS>
He
be
accordingly
show
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
where
he
have
not
be
many
minute
before
the
door
open
,
and
in
come
 
no
other
than
Sophia
herself
,
who
have
leave
the
play
before
the
end
of
the
first
act
;
for
this
,
as
we
have
already
say
,
be
,
a
new
play
,
at
which
two
large
party
meet
,
the
one
to
damn
,
and
the
other
to
applaud
,
a
violent
uproar
,
and
an
engagement
between
the
two
party
,
have
so
terrify
our
heroine
,
that
she
be
glad
to
put
herself
under
the
protection
of
a
young
gentleman
who
safely
convey
her
to
her
chair
.
  
<EOS>
as
Lady
Bellaston
have
acquaint
her
that
she
should
not
be
at
home
till
late
,
Sophia
,
expect
to
find
no
one
in
the
room
,
come
hastily
in
,
and
go
directly
to
a
glass
which
almost
front
her
,
without
once
look
towards
the
upper
end
of
the
room
,
where
the
statue
of
Jones
now
stand
motionless
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
glass
it
be
,
after
contemplate
her
own
lovely
face
,
that
she
first
discover
the
said
statue
;
when
,
instantly
turn
about
,
she
perceive
the
reality
of
the
vision
:
upon
which
she
give
a
violent
scream
,
and
scarce
preserve
herself
from
faint
,
till
Jones
be
able
to
move
to
her
,
and
support
her
in
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
to
paint
the
look
or
thought
of
either
of
these
lover
,
be
beyond
my
power
.
<EOS>
as
their
sensation
,
from
their
mutual
silence
,
may
be
judge
to
have
be
too
big
for
their
own
utterance
,
it
can
not
be
suppose
that
I
should
be
able
to
express
them
:
and
the
misfortune
be
,
that
few
of
my
reader
have
be
enough
in
love
to
feel
by
their
own
heart
<EOS>
what
past
at
this
time
in
theirs
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
short
pause
,
Jones
,
with
faultere
accent
,
say
 
"
I
see
,
madam
,
you
be
surprize

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
surprize
!
"
<EOS>
answer
she
;
"
<EOS>
oh
heaven
!
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
be
surprize
.
<EOS>
I
almost
doubt
whether
you
be
the
person
you
seem
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
"
cry
he
,
"
my
Sophia
,
pardon
me
,
madam
,
for
this
once
call
you
<EOS>
so

I
be
that
very
wretched
Jones

whom
fortune
,
after
so
many
disappointment
,
hath
,
at
last
,
kindly
conduct
to
you
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
my
Sophia
,
do
you
know
the
thousand
torment
I
have
suffer
in
this
long
,
fruitless
pursuit
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pursuit
of
whom
?
"
say
Sophia
,
a
little
recollecting
herself
,
and
assume
a
reserved
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
be
so
cruel
to
ask
that
question
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Jones
;
"
need
I
say
,
of
you
?
"
<EOS>
"
of
me
!
"
answer
Sophia
:
"
Hath
Mr
Jones
,
then
,
any
such
important
business
with
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
to
some
,
madam
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
this
may
seem
an
important
business
"
(
give
her
the
pocket
-
book
)
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
madam
,
you
will
find
it
of
the
same
value
as
when
it
be
lose
.
"
<EOS>
Sophia
take
the
pocket
-
book
,
and
be
go
to
speak
,
when
he
interrupt
her
thus
:
 
"
let
us
not
,
I
beseech
you
,
lose
one
of
these
precious
moment
which
fortune
hath
so
kindly
send
us
.
<EOS>
o
,
my
Sophia
!
<EOS>
I
have
business
of
a
much
superior
kind
.
<EOS>
thus
,
on
my
knee
,
let
me
ask
your
pardon
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
pardon
!
"
<EOS>
cry
she
;
"
sure
,
sir
,
after
what
be
past
,
you
can
not
expect
,
after
what
I
have
hear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
scarce
know
what
I
say
,
"
answer
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
by
heaven
!
<EOS>
I
scarce
wish
you
should
pardon
me
.
<EOS>
o
my
Sophia
!
<EOS>
henceforth
never
cast
away
a
thought
on
such
a
wretch
as
I
be
.
<EOS>
if
any
remembrance
of
me
should
ever
intrude
to
give
a
moment
's
uneasiness
to
that
tender
bosom
,
think
of
my
unworthiness
;
and
let
the
remembrance
of
what
pass
at
Upton
blot
me
for
ever
from
your
mind
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sophia
stand
tremble
all
this
while
.
<EOS>
Her
face
be
white
than
snow
,
and
her
heart
be
throb
through
her
stay
.
<EOS>
but
,
at
the
mention
of
Upton
,
a
blush
arise
in
her
cheek
,
and
her
eye
,
which
before
she
have
scarce
lift
up
,
be
turn
upon
Jones
with
a
glance
of
disdain
.
<EOS>
He
understand
this
silent
reproach
,
and
reply
to
it
thus
:
"
o
my
Sophia
!
<EOS>
my
only
love
!
<EOS>
you
can
not
hate
or
despise
me
more
for
what
happen
there
than
I
do
myself
;
but
yet
do
me
the
justice
to
think
that
my
heart
be
never
unfaithful
to
you
.
<EOS>
that
have
no
share
in
the
folly
<EOS>
I
be
guilty
of
;
it
be
even
then
unalterably
yours
.
<EOS>
though
I
despair
of
possess
you
,
nay
,
almost
of
ever
see
you
more
,
I
doate
still
on
your
charming
idea
,
and
could
seriously
love
no
other
woman
.
<EOS>
but
if
my
heart
have
not
be
engage
,
she
,
into
whose
company
I
accidently
fall
at
that
cursed
place
,
be
not
an
object
of
serious
love
.
<EOS>
believe
me
,
my
angel
,
I
never
have
see
her
from
that
day
to
this
;
and
never
intend
or
desire
to
see
her
again
.
<EOS>
"
Sophia
,
in
her
heart
,
be
very
glad
to
hear
this
;
but
force
into
her
face
an
air
of
more
coldness
than
she
have
yet
assume
,
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
she
,
"
Mr
Jones
,
do
you
take
the
trouble
to
make
a
defence
where
you
be
not
accuse
?
<EOS>
if
I
think
it
worth
while
to
accuse
you
,
I
have
a
charge
of
unpardonable
nature
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
,
for
heaven
's
sake
?
<EOS>
"
answer
Jones
,
tremble
and
pale
,
expect
to
hear
of
his
amour
with
Lady
Bellaston
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
"
say
she
,
"
how
be
it
possible
!
<EOS>
can
everything
noble
and
everything
base
be
lodge
together
in
the
same
bosom
?
<EOS>
"
Lady
Bellaston
,
and
the
ignominious
circumstance
of
have
be
keep
,
rise
again
in
his
mind
,
and
stopt
his
mouth
from
any
reply
.
"
<EOS>
Could
I
have
expect
,
"
proceed
Sophia
,
"
such
treatment
from
you
?
<EOS>
nay
,
from
any
gentleman
,
from
any
man
of
honour
?
<EOS>
to
have
my
name
traduce
in
public
;
in
inn
,
among
the
mean
vulgar
!
<EOS>
to
have
any
little
favour
that
my
unguarded
heart
may
have
too
lightly
betray
me
to
grant
,
boast
of
there
!
<EOS>
nay
,
even
to
hear
that
you
have
be
force
to
fly
from
my
love
!
"
  
<EOS>
nothing
could
equal
Jones
's
surprize
at
these
word
of
Sophia
;
but
yet
,
not
be
guilty
,
he
be
much
less
embarrassed
how
to
defend
himself
than
if
she
have
touch
that
tender
string
at
which
his
conscience
have
be
alarm
.
<EOS>
by
some
examination
he
presently
find
,
that
her
suppose
him
guilty
of
so
shock
an
outrage
against
his
love
,
and
her
reputation
,
be
entirely
owe
to
Partridge
's
talk
at
the
inn
before
landlord
and
servant
;
for
Sophia
confess
to
him
it
be
from
them
that
she
receive
her
intelligence
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
very
great
difficulty
to
make
her
believe
that
he
be
entirely
innocent
of
an
offence
so
foreign
to
his
character
;
but
she
have
a
great
deal
to
hinder
him
from
go
instantly
home
,
and
put
Partridge
to
death
,
which
he
more
than
once
swear
he
would
do
.
<EOS>
this
point
be
clear
up
,
they
soon
find
themselves
so
well
pleased
with
each
other
,
that
Jones
quite
forget
he
have
begin
the
conversation
with
conjure
her
to
give
up
all
thought
of
him
;
and
she
be
in
a
temper
to
have
give
ear
to
a
petition
of
a
very
different
nature
;
for
before
they
be
aware
they
have
both
go
so
far
,
that
he
let
fall
some
word
that
sound
like
a
proposal
of
marriage
.
<EOS>
to
which
she
reply
,
"
that
,
do
not
her
duty
to
her
father
forbid
her
to
follow
her
own
inclination
,
ruin
with
him
would
be
more
welcome
to
her
than
the
most
affluent
fortune
with
another
man
.
<EOS>
"
at
the
mention
of
the
word
ruin
,
he
start
,
let
drop
her
hand
,
which
he
have
hold
for
some
time
,
and
strike
his
breast
with
his
own
,
cry
out
,
"
oh
,
Sophia
!
<EOS>
can
I
then
ruin
thee
?
<EOS>
no
;
by
heaven
,
no
!
<EOS>
I
never
will
act
<EOS>
so
base
a
part
.
<EOS>
Dearest
Sophia
,
whatever
it
cost
me
,
I
will
renounce
you
;
I
will
give
you
up
;
I
will
tear
all
such
hope
from
my
heart
as
be
inconsistent
with
your
real
good
.
<EOS>
My
love
I
will
ever
retain
,
but
it
shall
be
in
silence
;
it
shall
be
at
a
distance
from
you
;
it
shall
be
in
some
foreign
land
;
from
whence
no
voice
,
no
sigh
of
my
despair
,
shall
ever
reach
and
disturb
your
ear
.
<EOS>
and
when
I
be
dead
"
 
h
e
would
have
go
on
,
but
be
stopt
by
a
flood
of
tear
which
Sophia
let
fall
in
his
bosom
,
upon
which
she
lean
,
without
be
able
to
speak
one
word
.
<EOS>
He
kiss
them
off
,
which
,
for
some
moment
,
she
allow
him
to
do
without
any
resistance
;
but
then
recollect
herself
,
gently
withdraw
out
of
his
arm
;
and
,
to
turn
the
discourse
from
a
subject
too
tender
,
and
which
she
find
she
could
not
support
,
bethought
herself
to
ask
him
a
question
she
never
have
time
to
put
to
him
before
,
"
how
he
come
into
that
room
?
"
<EOS>
He
begin
to
stammer
,
and
would
,
in
all
probability
,
have
raise
her
suspicion
by
the
answer
he
be
go
to
give
,
when
,
at
once
,
the
door
open
,
and
in
come
Lady
Bellaston
.
  
<EOS>
have
advance
a
few
step
,
and
see
Jones
and
Sophia
together
,
she
suddenly
stopt
;
when
,
after
a
pause
of
a
few
moment
,
recollect
herself
with
admirable
presence
of
mind
,
she
say
 
though
with
sufficient
indication
of
surprize
both
in
voice
and
countenance
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Miss
Western
,
you
have
be
at
the
play
?
"
  
<EOS>
though
Sophia
have
no
opportunity
of
learning
of
Jones
by
what
mean
he
have
discover
her
,
yet
,
as
she
have
not
the
least
suspicion
of
the
real
truth
,
or
that
Jones
and
Lady
Bellaston
be
acquaint
,
so
she
be
very
little
confounded
;
and
the
less
,
as
the
lady
have
,
in
all
their
conversation
on
the
subject
,
entirely
take
her
side
against
her
father
.
<EOS>
with
very
little
hesitation
,
therefore
,
she
go
through
the
whole
story
of
what
have
happen
at
the
play
-
house
,
and
the
cause
of
her
hasty
return
.
  
<EOS>
the
length
of
this
narrative
give
Lady
Bellaston
an
opportunity
of
rally
her
spirit
,
and
of
consider
in
what
manner
to
act
.
<EOS>
and
as
the
behaviour
of
Sophia
give
her
hope
that
Jones
have
not
betray
her
,
she
put
on
an
air
of
good
humour
,
and
say
,
"
I
should
not
have
break
in
so
abruptly
upon
you
,
Miss
Western
,
if
I
have
know
you
have
company
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Bellaston
fix
her
eye
on
Sophia
whilst
she
speak
these
word
.
<EOS>
to
which
that
poor
young
lady
,
have
her
face
overspread
with
blush
and
confusion
,
answer
,
in
a
stammering
voice
,
"
I
be
sure
,
madam
<EOS>
,
I
shall
always
think
the
honour
of
your
ladyship
's
company
"
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
at
least
,
"
cry
Lady
Bellaston
,
"
I
interrupt
no
business
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
madam
,
"
answer
Sophia
,
"
our
business
be
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
may
be
pleased
to
remember
I
have
often
mention
the
loss
of
my
pocket
-
book
,
which
this
gentleman
,
have
very
luckily
find
,
be
so
kind
to
return
it
to
me
with
the
bill
in
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
,
ever
since
the
arrival
of
Lady
Bellaston
,
have
be
ready
to
sink
with
fear
.
<EOS>
He
sit
kick
his
heel
,
play
with
his
finger
,
and
look
more
like
a
fool
,
if
it
be
possible
,
than
a
young
booby
squire
,
when
he
be
first
introduce
into
a
polite
assembly
.
<EOS>
He
begin
,
however
,
now
to
recover
himself
;
and
take
a
hint
from
the
behaviour
of
Lady
Bellaston
,
who
he
see
do
not
intend
to
claim
any
acquaintance
with
him
,
he
resolve
as
entirely
to
affect
the
stranger
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
ever
since
he
have
the
pocket
-
book
in
his
possession
,
he
have
use
great
diligence
in
enquire
out
the
lady
whose
name
be
writ
in
it
;
but
never
till
that
day
could
be
so
fortunate
to
discover
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sophia
have
indeed
mention
the
loss
of
her
pocket
-
book
to
Lady
Bellaston
;
but
as
Jones
,
for
some
reason
or
other
,
have
never
once
hint
to
her
that
it
be
in
his
possession
,
she
believe
not
one
syllable
of
what
Sophia
now
say
,
and
wonderfully
admire
the
extreme
quickness
of
the
young
lady
in
invent
such
an
excuse
.
<EOS>
the
reason
of
Sophia
's
leave
the
playhouse
meet
with
no
well
credit
;
and
though
she
could
not
account
for
the
meeting
between
these
two
lover
,
she
be
firmly
persuade
it
be
not
accidental
.
  
<EOS>
with
an
affected
smile
,
therefore
,
she
say
,
"
indeed
,
Miss
Western
,
you
have
have
very
good
luck
in
recover
your
money
.
<EOS>
not
only
as
it
fall
into
the
hand
of
a
gentleman
of
honour
,
but
as
he
happen
to
discover
to
whom
it
belong
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
would
not
consent
to
have
it
advertise
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
great
good
fortune
,
sir
,
that
you
find
out
to
whom
the
note
belong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
madam
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
it
be
enclose
in
a
pocket
-
book
,
in
which
the
young
lady
's
name
be
write
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
very
fortunate
,
indeed
,
"
cry
the
lady
:
 
"
<EOS>
and
it
be
no
less
so
,
that
you
hear
Miss
Western
be
at
my
house
;
for
she
be
very
little
known
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
have
at
length
perfectly
recover
his
spirit
;
and
as
he
conceive
he
have
now
an
opportunity
of
satisfy
Sophia
as
to
the
question
she
have
ask
him
just
before
Lady
Bellaston
come
in
,
he
proceed
thus
:
"
<EOS>
why
,
madam
,
"
answer
he
,
"
it
be
by
the
lucky
chance
imaginable
<EOS>
I
make
this
discovery
.
<EOS>
I
be
mention
what
I
have
find
,
and
the
name
of
the
owner
,
the
other
night
to
a
lady
at
the
masquerade
,
who
tell
me
she
believe
she
know
where
I
may
see
Miss
Western
;
and
if
I
would
come
to
her
house
the
next
morning
she
would
inform
me
,
I
go
accord
to
her
appointment
,
but
she
be
not
at
home
;
nor
could
I
ever
meet
with
her
till
this
morning
,
when
she
direct
me
to
your
ladyship
's
house
.
<EOS>
I
come
accordingly
,
and
do
myself
the
honour
to
ask
for
your
ladyship
;
and
upon
my
saying
that
I
have
very
particular
business
,
a
servant
show
me
into
this
room
;
where
I
have
not
be
long
before
the
young
lady
return
from
the
play
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
upon
his
mention
the
masquerade
,
he
look
very
slily
at
Lady
Bellaston
,
without
any
fear
of
be
remark
by
Sophia
;
for
she
be
visibly
too
much
confound
to
make
any
observation
.
<EOS>
this
hint
a
little
alarm
the
lady
,
and
she
be
silent
;
when
Jones
,
who
see
the
agitation
of
Sophia
's
mind
,
resolve
to
take
the
only
method
of
relieve
her
,
which
be
by
retire
;
but
,
before
he
do
this
,
he
say
,
"
I
believe
,
madam
,
it
be
customary
to
give
some
reward
on
these
occasion
;
 
I
must
insist
on
a
very
high
one
for
my
honesty
;
 
it
be
,
madam
,
no
less
than
the
honour
of
be
permit
to
pay
another
visit
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
reply
the
lady
,
"
I
make
no
doubt
that
you
be
a
gentleman
,
and
my
door
be
never
shut
to
people
of
fashion
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
then
,
after
proper
ceremonial
,
depart
,
highly
to
his
own
satisfaction
,
and
no
less
to
that
of
Sophia
;
who
be
terribly
alarm
lest
Lady
Bellaston
should
discover
what
she
know
already
but
too
well
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
stair
Jones
meet
his
old
acquaintance
,
Mrs
Honour
,
who
,
notwithstanding
all
she
have
say
against
him
,
be
now
so
well
breed
to
behave
with
great
civility
.
<EOS>
this
meeting
prove
indeed
a
lucky
circumstance
,
as
he
communicate
to
her
the
house
where
he
lodge
,
with
which
Sophia
be
unacquainted
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
the
thirteenth
book
be
conclude
.
 
<EOS>
the
elegant
Lord
Shaftesbury
somewhere
object
to
tell
too
much
truth
:
by
which
it
may
be
fairly
infer
,
that
,
in
some
case
,
to
lie
be
not
only
excusable
but
commendable
.
  
<EOS>
and
surely
there
be
no
person
who
may
so
properly
challenge
a
right
to
this
commendable
deviation
from
truth
,
as
young
woman
in
the
affair
of
love
;
for
which
they
may
plead
precept
,
education
,
and
above
all
<EOS>
,
the
sanction
,
nay
,
I
may
say
the
necessity
of
custom
,
by
which
they
be
restrain
,
not
from
submit
to
the
honest
impulse
of
nature
(
for
that
would
be
a
foolish
prohibition
)
,
but
from
own
them
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
not
,
therefore
,
ashamed
to
say
,
that
our
heroine
now
pursue
the
dictate
of
the
above
-
mention
right
honourable
philosopher
.
<EOS>
as
she
be
perfectly
satisfied
then
,
that
Lady
Bellaston
be
ignorant
of
the
person
of
Jones
,
so
she
determine
to
keep
her
in
that
ignorance
,
though
at
the
expense
of
a
little
fibbing
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
have
not
be
long
go
,
before
Lady
Bellaston
cry
,
"
upon
my
word
,
a
good
pretty
young
fellow
;
I
wonder
who
he
be
;
for
I
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
see
his
face
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
nor
I
neither
,
madam
,
"
cry
Sophia
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
say
he
behave
very
handsomely
in
relation
to
my
note
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
and
he
be
a
very
handsome
fellow
,
"
say
the
lady
:
"
do
not
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
take
much
notice
of
him
,
"
answer
Sophia
,
"
but
I
think
he
seem
rather
awkward
,
and
ungenteel
than
otherwise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
extremely
right
,
"
cry
Lady
Bellaston
:
"
you
may
see
,
by
his
manner
,
that
he
hath
not
keep
good
company
.
<EOS>
nay
,
notwithstanding
his
return
your
note
,
and
refuse
the
reward
,
I
almost
question
whether
he
be
a
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
always
observe
there
be
a
something
in
person
well
bear
,
which
other
can
never
acquire
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
will
give
order
not
to
be
at
home
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
sure
,
madam
,
"
answer
Sophia
,
"
one
can
not
suspect
after
what
he
hath
do
;
 
besides
,
if
your
ladyship
observe
him
,
there
be
an
elegance
in
his
discourse
,
a
delicacy
,
a
prettiness
of
expression
that
,
that
"
  
"
I
confess
,
"
say
Lady
Bellaston
,
"
the
fellow
hath
word
 
<EOS>
and
indeed
,
Sophia
,
you
must
forgive
me
,
<EOS>
indeed
you
must

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
forgive
your

say
Sophia

<EOS>
"
yes
,
indeed
you
must

answer
she
,
laugh
;
"
for
I
have
a
horrible
suspicion
when
I
first
come
into
the
room
 
<EOS>
I
vow
<EOS>
you
must
forgive
it
;
but
I
suspect
it
be
Mr
Jones
himself

do
your

indeed

Sophia

affect
a

<EOS>
yes

I
vow
<EOS>
I
do

she

<EOS>
"
I
can
not
imagine
what
put
it
into
my
head

give
the
fellow
his
due

genteely
dr
;
which
,
I
think

dear
Sophy

be
not
commonly
the

with
your
friend

"
  
<EOS>
"
this
raillery

cry
Sophia

"
be
a
little
cruel

Lady
Bellaston

after
my
promise

your

"
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all

child

the
lady
;
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
be
cruel
before

after
you
have
promise
me
never
to
marry
without
your
father

consent
,
in
which
you
know
be
imply
your
give
up
Jones

sure
you
can
bear
a
little
raillery
on
a
passion
which
be
pardonable
enough
in
a
young
girl
in
the
country

of
which
you
tell
me
you
have
so
entirely
get
the
well

what
must
I
think

my
dear
Sophy

if
you
can
not
bear
a
little
ridicule
even
on
his
dress

I
shall
begin

fear
you

very
far
go
indeed

almost
question
whether
you

deal
ingenuously

indeed

on

"
answer
the
lady
:
"
You
must
have
mistake
me
;
I
go
no
farther
than
his
dress

I

the

hastily

Mr

answer
Sophia

immediately
recollect
herself
,
"
Mr

!
 
<EOS>
no

no

I
ask
your
pardon

I

<EOS>
"
O
Sophy

Sophy
!
"
<EOS>
cry
the

this
Mr
Jones

I
be
afraid

still
run
in
your

<EOS>
"
then
,
upon
my

Mr

indifferent

leave
us

"
upon
my
honour

Lady
Bellaston

I
believe
it

<EOS>
forgive
me
,
therefore
,
a
little
innocent
raillery
;
but
I
promise
you
I
will
never
mention
his
name
any
more

"
  
<EOS>
and
now
the
two
lady
separate
,
infinitely
more
to
the
delight
of
Sophia
than
of
Lady
Bellaston
,
who
would
willingly
have
torment
her
rival
a
little
longer
,
have
not
business
of
more
importance
call
her
away
.
<EOS>
as
for
Sophia
,
her
mind
be
not
perfectly
easy
under
this
first
practice
of
deceit
;
upon
which
,
when
she
retire
to
her
chamber
,
she
reflect
with
the
high
uneasiness
and
conscious
shame
.
<EOS>
nor
could
the
peculiar
hardship
of
her
situation
,
and
the
necessity
of
the
case
,
at
all
reconcile
her
mind
to
her
conduct
;
for
the
frame
of
her
mind
be
too
delicate
to
bear
the
thought
of
have
be
guilty
of
a
falsehood
,
however
qualify
by
circumstance

<EOS>
nor
do
this
thought

BOOK
XIV
.
  
<EOS>
contain
two
day
.
    
<EOS>
an
essay
to
prove
that
an
author
will
write
the
well
for
have
some
knowledge
of
the
subject
on
which
he
write
.
 
<EOS>
as
several
gentleman
in
these
time
,
by
the
wonderful
force
of
genius
only
,
without
the
least
assistance
of
learning
,
perhaps
,
without
be
well
able
to
read
,
have
make
a
considerable
figure
in
the
republic
of
letter
;
the
modern
critic
,
I
be
tell
,
have
lately
begin
to
assert
,
that
all
kind
of
learning
be
entirely
useless
to
a
writer
;
and
,
indeed
,
no
other
than
a
kind
of
fetter
on
the
natural
sprightliness
and
activity
of
the
imagination
,
which
be
thus
weigh
down
,
and
prevent
from
soar
to
those
high
flight
which
otherwise
it
would
be
able
to
reach
.
  
<EOS>
this
doctrine
,
I
be
afraid
,
be
at
present
carry
much
too
far
:
for
why
should
write
differ
so
much
from
all
other
art
?
<EOS>
the
nimbleness
of
a
dancing
-
master
be
not
at
all
prejudice
by
be
teach
to
move
;
nor
doth
any
mechanic
,
I
believe
,
exercise
his
tool
the
bad
by
have
learn
to
use
them
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
can
not
conceive
that
Homer
or
Virgil
would
have
writ
with
more
fire
,
if
instead
of
be
master
of
all
the
learning
of
their
time
,
they
have
be
as
ignorant
as
most
of
the
author
of
the
present
age
.
<EOS>
nor
do
I
believe
that
all
the
imagination
,
fire
,
and
judgment
of
Pitt
,
could
have
produce
those
oration
that
have
make
the
senate
of
England
,
in
these
our
time
,
a
rival
in
eloquence
to
Greece
and
Rome
,
if
he
have
not
be
so
well
read
in
the
writing
of
Demosthenes
and
Cicero
,
as
to
have
transfer
their
whole
spirit
into
his
speech
,
and
,
with
their
spirit
,
their
knowledge
too
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
not
here
be
understand
to
insist
on
the
same
fund
of
learning
in
any
of
my
brother
,
as
Cicero
persuade
us
be
necessary
to
the
composition
of
an
orator
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
very
little
reading
be
,
I
conceive
,
necessary
to
the
poet
,
less
to
the
critic
,
and
the
least
of
all
to
the
politician
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
,
perhaps
,
Byshe
's
Art
of
Poetry
,
and
a
few
of
our
modern
poet
,
may
suffice
;
for
the
second
,
a
moderate
heap
of
play
;
and
,
for
the
last
,
an
indifferent
collection
of
political
journal
.
  
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
I
require
no
more
than
that
a
man
should
have
some
little
knowledge
of
the
subject
on
which
he
treat
,
accord
to
the
old
maxim
of
law
,
Quam
quisque
norit
artem
in
ea
<EOS>
se
exerceat
.
<EOS>
with
this
alone
a
writer
may
sometimes
do
tolerably
well
;
and
,
indeed
,
without
this
,
all
the
other
learning
in
the
world
will
stand
him
in
little
stead
.
  
<EOS>
for
instance
,
let
us
suppose
that
Homer
and
Virgil
,
Aristotle
and
Cicero
,
Thucydides
and
Livy
,
could
have
meet
all
together
,
and
have
club
their
several
talent
to
have
compose
a
treatise
on
the
art
of
dancing
:
<EOS>
I
believe
it
will
be
readily
agree
they
could
not
have
equal
the
excellent
treatise
which
Mr
Essex
hath
give
us
on
that
subject
,
entitle
,
<EOS>
the
Rudiments
of
Genteel
Education
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
should
the
excellent
Mr
Broughton
be
prevail
on
to
set
fist
to
paper
,
and
to
complete
the
above
-
say
rudiment
,
by
deliver
down
the
true
principle
of
athletic
<EOS>
,
I
question
whether
the
world
will
have
any
cause
to
lament
,
that
none
of
the
great
writer
,
either
antient
or
modern
,
have
ever
treat
about
that
noble
and
useful
art
.
  
<EOS>
to
avoid
a
multiplicity
of
example
in
so
plain
a
case
,
and
to
come
at
once
to
my
point
,
I
be
apt
to
conceive
,
that
one
reason
why
many
english
writer
have
totally
fail
in
describe
the
manner
of
upper
life
,
may
possibly
be
,
that
in
reality
they
know
nothing
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
knowledge
unhappily
not
in
the
power
of
many
author
to
arrive
at
.
<EOS>
book
will
give
us
a
very
imperfect
idea
of
it
;
nor
will
the
stage
a
much
well
:
the
fine
gentleman
form
upon
read
the
former
will
almost
always
turn
out
a
pedant
,
and
he
who
form
himself
upon
the
latter
,
a
coxcomb
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
the
character
draw
from
these
model
better
support
.
<EOS>
Vanbrugh
and
Congreve
copy
nature
;
but
they
who
copy
them
draw
as
unlike
the
present
age
as
Hogarth
would
do
if
he
be
to
paint
a
rout
or
a
drum
in
the
dress
of
titian
and
of
Vandyke
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
imitation
here
will
not
do
the
business
.
<EOS>
the
picture
must
be
after
Nature
herself
.
<EOS>
a
true
knowledge
of
the
world
be
gain
only
by
conversation
,
and
the
manner
of
every
rank
must
be
see
in
order
to
be
know
.
  
<EOS>
now
it
happen
that
this
high
order
of
mortal
be
not
to
be
see
,
like
all
the
rest
of
the
human
specie
,
for
nothing
,
in
the
street
,
shop
,
and
coffee
-
house
;
nor
be
they
show
,
like
the
upper
rank
of
animal
,
for
so
much
a
-
piece
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
this
be
a
sight
to
which
no
person
be
admit
without
one
or
other
of
these
qualification
,
viz
.
<EOS>
,
either
birth
or
fortune
,
or
,
what
be
equivalent
to
both
,
the
honourable
profession
of
a
gamester
.
<EOS>
and
,
very
unluckily
for
the
world
,
person
so
qualified
very
seldom
care
to
take
upon
themselves
the
bad
trade
of
writing
;
which
be
generally
enter
upon
by
the
low
and
poor
sort
,
as
it
be
a
trade
which
many
think
require
no
kind
of
stock
to
set
up
with
.
  
<EOS>
hence
those
strange
monster
in
lace
and
embroidery
,
in
silk
and
brocade
,
with
vast
wig
and
hoop
;
which
,
under
the
name
of
lord
and
lady
,
strut
the
stage
,
to
the
great
delight
of
attorney
and
their
clerk
in
the
pit
,
and
of
the
citizen
and
their
apprentice
in
the
gallery
;
and
which
be
no
more
to
be
find
in
real
life
than
the
centaur
,
the
chimera
,
or
any
other
creature
of
mere
fiction
.
<EOS>
but
to
let
my
reader
into
a
secret
,
this
knowledge
of
upper
life
,
though
very
necessary
for
prevent
mistake
,
be
no
very
great
resource
to
a
writer
whose
province
be
comedy
,
or
that
kind
of
novel
which
,
like
this
I
be
write
,
be
of
the
comic
class
.
  
<EOS>
what
Mr
Pope
say
of
woman
be
very
applicable
to
most
in
this
station
,
who
be
,
indeed
,
so
entirely
make
up
of
form
and
affectation
,
that
they
have
no
character
at
all
,
at
least
none
which
appear
.
<EOS>
I
will
venture
to
say
the
high
life
be
much
the
dull
,
and
afford
very
little
humour
or
entertainment
.
<EOS>
the
various
calling
in
low
sphere
produce
the
great
variety
of
humorous
character
;
whereas
here
,
except
among
the
few
who
be
engage
in
the
pursuit
of
ambition
,
and
the
few
still
who
have
a
relish
for
pleasure
,
all
be
vanity
and
servile
imitation
.
<EOS>
dressing
and
card
,
eating
and
drink
,
bowing
and
courtesying
,
make
up
the
business
of
their
life
.
  
<EOS>
some
there
be
,
however
,
of
this
rank
upon
whom
passion
exercise
its
tyranny
,
and
hurry
them
far
beyond
the
bound
which
decorum
prescribe
;
of
these
the
lady
be
as
much
distinguish
by
their
noble
intrepidity
,
and
a
certain
superior
contempt
of
reputation
,
from
the
frail
one
of
meaner
degree
,
as
a
virtuous
woman
of
quality
be
by
the
elegance
and
delicacy
of
her
sentiment
from
the
honest
wife
of
a
yeoman
and
shopkeeper
.
<EOS>
Lady
Bellaston
be
of
this
intrepid
character
;
but
let
not
my
country
reader
conclude
from
her
,
that
this
be
the
general
conduct
of
woman
of
fashion
,
or
that
we
mean
to
represent
them
as
such
.
<EOS>
They
may
as
well
suppose
that
every
clergyman
be
represent
by
Thwackum
,
or
every
soldier
by
ensign
Northerton
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
not
,
indeed
,
a
great
error
than
that
which
universally
prevail
among
the
vulgar
,
who
,
borrow
their
opinion
from
some
ignorant
satirist
,
have
affix
the
character
of
lewdness
to
these
time
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
I
be
convince
there
never
be
less
of
love
intrigue
carry
on
among
person
of
condition
than
now
.
<EOS>
Our
present
woman
have
be
teach
by
their
mother
to
fix
their
thought
only
on
ambition
and
vanity
,
and
to
despise
the
pleasure
of
love
as
unworthy
their
regard
;
and
be
afterwards
,
by
the
care
of
such
mother
,
marry
without
have
husband
,
they
seem
pretty
well
confirm
in
the
justness
of
those
sentiment
;
whence
they
content
themselves
,
for
the
dull
remainder
of
life
,
with
the
pursuit
of
more
innocent
,
but
I
be
afraid
more
childish
amusement
,
<EOS>
the
bare
mention
of
which
would
ill
suit
with
the
dignity
of
this
history
.
<EOS>
in
my
humble
opinion
,
the
true
characteristic
of
the
present
beau
monde
be
rather
folly
than
vice
,
and
the
only
epithet
which
it
deserve
be
that
of
frivolous
.
    
<EOS>
contain
letter
and
other
matter
which
attend
amour
.
 
<EOS>
Jones
have
not
be
long
at
home
before
he
receive
the
following
letter
:
      
<EOS>
"
I
be
never
more
surprized
than
when
I
find
you
be
go
.
<EOS>
when
you
  
leave
the
room
I
little
imagine
you
intend
to
have
leave
the
house
  
without
see
me
again
.
<EOS>
Your
behaviour
be
all
of
a
piece
,
and
  
convince
me
how
much
I
ought
to
despise
a
heart
which
can
doat
upon
  
an
idiot
;
though
I
know
not
whether
I
should
not
admire
her
cunning
  
more
than
her
simplicity
:
wonderful
both
!
<EOS>
for
though
she
understand
  
not
a
word
of
what
pass
between
us
,
yet
she
have
the
skill
,
the
  
assurance
,
<EOS>
the
 
what
shall
I
call
it
?
<EOS>
to
deny
to
my
face
that
she
  
know
you
,
or
ever
see
you
before
.
 
<EOS>
be
this
a
scheme
lay
between
  
you
,
and
have
you
be
base
enough
to
betray
me
?
 
<EOS>
o
how
I
despise
  
her
,
you
,
and
all
the
world
,
but
chiefly
myself
!
<EOS>
for
 
I
dare
not
  
write
what
I
should
afterwards
run
mad
to
read
;
but
remember
,
I
can
  
detest
as
violently
as
I
have
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
have
but
<EOS>
little
time
give
him
to
reflect
on
this
letter
,
before
a
second
be
bring
him
from
the
same
hand
;
and
this
,
likewise
,
we
shall
set
down
in
the
precise
word
.
    
<EOS>
"
when
you
consider
the
hurry
of
spirit
in
which
I
must
have
writ
,
  
you
can
not
be
surprize
at
any
expression
in
my
former
note
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
  
perhaps
,
on
reflection
,
they
be
rather
too
warm
.
<EOS>
at
least
I
would
,
  
if
possible
,
think
all
owe
to
the
odious
playhouse
,
and
to
the
  
impertinence
of
a
fool
,
which
detain
me
beyond
my
  
appointment
.
 
<EOS>
how
easy
be
it
to
think
well
of
those
we
  
love
!
 
<EOS>
perhaps
you
desire
I
should
think
so
.
<EOS>
I
have
resolve
to
  
<EOS>
see
you
to
-
night
;
so
come
to
me
immediately
.
    
<EOS>
"
P.S.
 
<EOS>
I
have
order
to
be
at
home
to
none
but
yourself
.
    
<EOS>
"
P.S.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jones
will
imagine
I
shall
assist
him
in
his
defence
;
  
for
I
believe
he
can
not
desire
to
impose
on
me
more
than
I
desire
to
  
impose
on
myself
.
    
<EOS>
"
P.S.
 
come
immediately
.
"
  
<EOS>
to
the
man
of
intrigue
I
refer
the
determination
,
whether
the
angry
or
the
tender
letter
give
the
great
uneasiness
to
Jones
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
he
have
no
violent
inclination
to
pay
any
more
visit
that
evening
,
unless
to
one
single
person
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
think
his
honour
engage
,
and
have
not
this
be
motive
sufficient
,
he
would
not
have
venture
to
blow
the
temper
of
Lady
Bellaston
into
that
flame
of
which
he
have
reason
to
think
it
susceptible
,
and
of
which
he
fear
the
consequence
may
be
a
discovery
to
Sophia
,
which
he
dread
.
<EOS>
after
some
discontent
walk
therefore
about
the
room
,
he
be
prepare
to

She

Jones
fall
upon

the
most
violent
protestation

neither

for
why
should
she
meet
man
at
another

It
can
never

for
if
she
have
a
lawful
design

court
,
as
to
be
sure
any

may
lawfully
give

I
can
not

you
will

,
Mr

I
think
you
be
not
over
and
above
generous
,
and
yet
I
have
hear
some
servant
say
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
sure
you
will
do
me
the
justice
to
own

I
never

<EOS>
here
Jones
hastily
take
the
letter
,
and
presently
after
slip
five
piece
into
her
hand
.
<EOS>
He
then
return
a
thousand
thank
to
his
dear
Sophia
in
a
whisper
,
and
beg
her
to
leave
him
to
read
her
letter
:
she
presently
depart
,
not
without
express
much
grateful
sense
of
his
generosity
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Bellaston
now
come
from
behind
the
curtain
.
<EOS>
how
shall
I
describe
her
rage
?
<EOS>
Her
tongue
be
at
first
incapable
of
utterance
;
but
stream
of
fire
dart
from
her
eye
,
and
well
indeed
they
may
,
for
her
heart
be
all
in
a
flame
.
<EOS>
and
now
as
soon
as
her
voice
find
way
,
instead
of
express
any
indignation
against
Honour
or
her
own
servant
,
she
begin
to
attack
poor
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
say
she
,
"
what
I
have
sacrifice
to
you
;
my
reputation
,
my
honour
 
go
for
ever

<EOS>
and
what
return
have
I
find
?
<EOS>
neglect
,
slight
for
a
country
girl
,
for
an
idiot

"
 
<EOS>
"
what
neglect

madam
,
or
what
slight

"
cry
Jones
,
"
have
I
be
guilty
of
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Jones
,
"
say
she
,
"
it
be
in
vain
to
dissemble
;
if
you
will
make
me
easy
,
you
must
entirely
give
her
up
;
and
as
a
proof
of
your
intention
,
show
me
the
letter

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
letter
,
madam

"
say
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
surely
,
"
say
she
,
"
you
can
not
have
the
confidence
to
deny
your
have
receive
a
letter
by
the
hand

that
trollop

<EOS>

and
can
your

cry
he
,
"
<EOS>
ask
of
me
what

have
I
act

such

manner

<EOS>
Could
I
be
guilty

betray
this
poor
innocent
girl
to
you

what
security
could
you
have
that
I
should
not
act
the
same
part
by
yourself
?
<EOS>
a
moment
's
reflection
will
,
I
be
sure
,
convince
you
that
a
man
with
whom
the
secret
of
a
lady
be
not
safe
must
be
the
most
contemptible
of
wretch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
say
she
 
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
insist
on
your
become
this
contemptible
wretch
in
your
own
opinion
;
for
the
inside
of
the
letter
could
inform
me
of
nothing
more
than
I
know
already
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
footing
you
be
upon
.
"
 
<EOS>
here
ensue
a
long
conversation
,
which
the
reader
,
who
be
not
too
curious
,
will
thank
me
for
not
insert
at
length
.
<EOS>
It
shall
suffice
,
therefore
,
to
inform
him
,
that
Lady
Bellaston
grow
more
and
more
pacified
,
and
at
length
believe
,
or
affect
to
believe
,
his
protestation
,
that
his
meeting
with
Sophia
that
evening
be
merely
accidental
,
and
every
other
matter
which
the
reader
already
know
,
and
which
,
as
Jones
set
before
her
in
the
strong
light
,
it
be
plain
that
she
have
in
reality
no
reason
to
be
angry
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
not
,
however
,
in
her
heart
perfectly
satisfy
with
his
refusal
to
show
her
the
letter
;
so
deaf
be
we
to
the
clear
reason
,
when
it
argue
against
our
prevail
passion
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
indeed
,
well
convinced
that
Sophia
possess
the
first
place
in
Jones
's
affection
;
and
yet
,
haughty
and
amorous
as
this
lady
be
<EOS>
,
she
submit
at
last
to
bear
the
second
place
;
or
,
to
express
it
more
properly
in
a
legal
phrase
,
be
content
with
the
possession
of
that
of
which
another
woman
have
the
reversion
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
at
length
<EOS>
agree
that
Jones
should
for
the
future
visit
at
the
house
:
for
that
Sophia
,
her
maid
,
and
all
the
servant
,
would
place
these
visit
to
the
account
of
Sophia
;
and
that
she
herself
would
be
consider
as
the
person
impose
upon
.
  
<EOS>
this
scheme
be
contrive
by
the
lady
,
and
highly
relish
by
Jones
,
who
be
indeed
glad
to
have
a
prospect
of
see
his
Sophia
at
any
rate
;
and
the
lady
herself
be
not
a
little
pleased
with
the
imposition
on
Sophia
,
which
Jones
,
she
think
,
could
not
possibly
discover
to
her
for
his
own
sake
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
be
appoint
for
the
first
visit
,
and
then
,
after
proper
ceremonial
,
the
Lady
Bellaston
return
home
.
    
<EOS>
contain
various
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Jones
be
no
sooner
alone
than
he
eagerly
break
open
his
letter
,
and
read
as
follow
:
      
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
it
be
impossible
to
express
what
I
have
suffer
since
you
  
leave
this
house
;
and
as
I
have
reason
to
think
you
intend
come
  
here
again
,
I
have
send
Honour
,
though
so
late
at
night
,
as
she
  
tell
me
she
know
your
lodging
,
to
prevent
you
.
<EOS>
I
charge
you
,
by
  
all
the
regard
you
have
for
me
,
not
to
think
of
visit
here
;
for
  
it
will
certainly
be
discover
;
nay
,
I
almost
doubt
,
from
some
  
thing
which
have
dropt
from
her
ladyship
,
that
she
be
not
already
  
without
some
suspicion
.
<EOS>
something
favourable
perhaps
may
happen
;
we
  
must
wait
with
patience
;
but
I
once
more
entreat
you
,
<EOS>
if
you
have
  
any
concern
for
my
ease
,
do
not
think
of
return
hither
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
letter
administer
the
same
kind
of
consolation
to
poor
Jones
,
which
Job
formerly
receive
from
his
friend
.
<EOS>
besides
disappoint
all
the
hope
which
he
promise
to
himself
from
see
Sophia
,
he
be
reduce
to
an
unhappy
dilemma
,
with
regard
to
Lady
Bellaston
;
for
there
be
some
certain
engagement
,
which
,
as
he
well
know
,
do
very
difficultly
admit
of
any
excuse
for
the
failure
;
and
to
go
,
after
the
strict
prohibition
from
Sophia
,
he
be
not
to
be
force
by
any
human
power
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
after
much
deliberation
,
which
during
that
night
supply
the
place
of
sleep
,
he
determine
to
feign
himself
sick
:
for
this
suggest
itself
as
the
only
mean
of
fail
the
appoint
visit
,
without
incense
Lady
Bellaston
,
which
he
have
more
than
one
reason
of
desire
to
avoid
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
thing
,
however
,
which
he
do
in
the
morning
,
be
,
to
write
an
answer
to
Sophia
,
which
he
inclose
in
one
to
Honour
.
<EOS>
He
then
despatch
another
to
Lady
Bellaston
,
contain
the
above
-
mention
excuse
;
and
to
this
he
soon
receive
the
follow
answer
:
      
<EOS>
"
I
be
vexed
that
I
can
not
see
you
here
this
afternoon
,
but
more
  
concerned
for
the
occasion
;
take
great
care
of
yourself
,
and
have
  
the
good
advice
,
and
I
hope
there
will
be
no
danger
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
<EOS>
so
  
torment
all
this
morning
with
fool
,
that
I
have
scarce
a
moment
's
  
time
to
write
to
you
.
<EOS>
Adieu
.
    
<EOS>
"
P.S.
 
<EOS>
I
will
endeavour
to
call
on
you
this
evening
,
at
nine
.
 
<EOS>
be
  
sure
to
be
alone

<EOS>
Mr
Jones
now
receive
a
visit
from
Mrs
Miller
,
who
,
after
some
formal
introduction
,
begin
the
follow
speech
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
sorry
,
sir
,
to
wait
upon
you
on
such
an
occasion
;
but
I
hope
you
will
consider
the
ill
consequence
which
it
must
be
to
the
reputation
of
my
poor
girl
,
if
my
house
should
once
be
talk
of
as
a
house
of
ill
-
fame
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
not
think
me
,
therefore
,
guilty
of
impertinence
,
if
I
beg
you
not
to
bring
any
more
lady
in
at
that
time
of
night

the
clock

<EOS>
"
I
do
assure
you
,

say
Jones
,
"
the
lady
who
be
here
last
night

who
staid
the
late
<EOS>
(
for
the
other
only
bring
me
a
letter
)
,
be
a
woman
of
very
great
fashion

and
my
near
relation

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
fashion
<EOS>
she
be
of
,
"
answer
Mrs
Miller
;
"
but
I
be
sure
no
woman
of
virtue
,
unless
a
very
near
relation
indeed
,
would
visit
a
young
gentleman
at
ten
at
night
,
and
stay
four
hour
in
his
room
with
him
alone
;
besides
,
sir
,
the
behaviour
of
her
chairman
show
what
she
be
;
for
they
do
nothing
but
make
jest
all
the
evening
in
the
entry
,
and
ask
Mr
Partridge
,
in
the
hearing
of
my
own
maid
,
if
madam
intend
to
stay
with
his
master
all
night
;
with
a
great
deal
of
stuff
not
proper
to
be
repeat
.
<EOS>
I
have
really
a
great
respect
for
you
,
Mr
Jones
,
upon
your
own
account
;
nay
,
I
have
a
very
high
obligation
to
you
for
your
generosity
to
my
cousin
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
do
not
know
how
very
good
you
have
be
till
lately
.
<EOS>
little
do
I
imagine
to
what
dreadful
course
<EOS>
the
poor
man
's
distress
have
drive
him
.
<EOS>
little
<EOS>
do
I
think
,
when
you
give
me
the
ten
guinea
,
that
you
have
give
them
to
a
highwayman
!
<EOS>
o
heaven
!
<EOS>
what
goodness
have
you
show
!
<EOS>
how
have
you
preserve
this
family
!
 
<EOS>
the
character
which
Mr
Allworthy
hath
formerly
give
me
of
you
be
,
I
find
,
strictly
true
.
 
<EOS>
and
indeed
,
if
I
have
no
obligation
to
you
,
my
obligation
to
him
be
such
,
<EOS>
that
,
on
his
account
,
I
should
shew
you
the
utmost
respect
in
my
power

<EOS>
Nay
,
believe
me
,
<EOS>
dear
Mr
Jones
,
if
my
daughter
'
and
my
own
reputation
be
out
of
the
case
,
I
should
,
for
your
own
sake
,
be
sorry
that
so
pretty
a
young
gentleman
should
converse
with
these
woman
;
but
if
you
be
resolve
to
do
it
,
I
must
beg
you
to
take
another
lodging
;
for
I
do
not
myself
like
to
have
such
thing
carry
on
under
my
roof
;
but
more
especially
upon
the
account
of
my

who
have
little

know

besides
their
character

to

he

a

warmly

I

I

"
as
sure

be
the
very
young

description

<EOS>
the
Lord
above
know
who
it

tell
her

for
I
be
the
arrant
villain
that
ever
walk
upon

leg
if
ever
it
come
out

<EOS>
I
promise
you
,
sir

I
can
keep
a
secret
when
I
be
desire
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
sir
,
so
far
be
I
from
tell
her
anything
about
Mr
Allworthy
,
that
I
tell
her
the
very
direct
contrary
;
for
,
though
I
do
not
contradict
it
at
that
moment
,
yet
,
as
second
thought
,
they
say
,
be
good
,
so
when
I
come
to
consider
that
somebody
must
have
inform
her
,
think
I
to
myself
,
I
will
put
an
end
to
the
story
;
and
so
I
go
back
again
into
the
parlour
some
time
afterwards
,
and
say
I
,
upon
my
word
,
say
I
,
<EOS>
whoever
,
say
I
,
tell
you
that
this
gentleman
be
Mr
Jones
;
that
is
,
say
I
,
that
this
Mr
Jones
be
that
Mr
Jones
,
tell
you
a
confound
lie
:
and
I
beg
,
say
I
,
you
will
never
mention
any
such
matter
,
say
I
;
for
my
master
,
say
I
,
will
think
I
must
have
tell
you
so
;
and
I
defy
anybody
in
the
house
ever
to
say
I
mention
any
such
word
.
<EOS>
to
be
certain
,
sir
,
it
be
a
wonderful
thing
,
and
I
have
be
think
with
myself
ever
since
,
how
it
be
she
come
to
know
it
;
<EOS>
not
<EOS>
but
I
see
an
old
woman
here
t'other
day
a
begging
at
the
door
,
who
look
as
like
her
<EOS>
we
see
in
Warwickshire
<EOS>
,
that
cause
all
that
mischief
to
us
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
it
be
never
good
to
pass
by
an
old
woman
without
give
her
something
,
especially
if
she
look
at
you
;
for
all
the
world
shall
never
persuade
me
but
that
they
have
a
great
power
to
do
mischief
,
and
to
be
sure
I
shall
never
see
an
old
woman
again
,
but
I
shall
think
to
myself
,
Infandum

regina

jube

"
  
<EOS>
the
simplicity
of
Partridge
set
Jones
a
laughing
,
and
put
a
final
end
to
his
anger
,
which
have
indeed
seldom
any
long
duration
in
his
mind
;
and
,
instead
of
comment
on
his
defence
,
he
tell
him
he
intend
presently
to
leave
those
lodging
,
and
order
him
to
go
and
endeavour
to
get
him
other
.
    
<EOS>
which
we
hope
will
be
very
attentively
peruse
by
young
people
of
both
sex
.
 
<EOS>
Partridge
have
no
sooner
leave
Mr
Jones
than
Mr
Nightingale
,
with
whom
he
have
now
contract
a
great
intimacy
,
come
to
him
,
and
,
after
a
short
salutation
,
say
,
"
so
,
Tom
,
I
hear
you
have
company
very
late
last
night
.
<EOS>
upon
my
soul
you
be
a
happy
fellow
,
who
have
not
be
in
town
above
a
fortnight
,
and
can
keep
chair
wait
at
your
door
till
two
in
the
morning
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
run
on
with
much
commonplace
raillery
of
the
same
kind
,
till
Jones
at
last
interrupt
him
,
say
,
"
I
suppose
you
have
receive
all
this
information
from
Mrs
Miller
,
who
hath
be
up
here
a
little
while
ago
to
give
me
warning

the
good
woman
be
afraid

it
seem
,
of
the
reputation
of
her
daughter

"
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
she
be
wonderfully
nice
,
"
say
Nightingale
,
"
upon
that
account
;
if
you
remember
,
she
would
not
let
Nancy
go
with
us
to
the
masquerade

<EOS>
"
Nay
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
think
she
be
in
the
right
of
it
,
"

Jones
:
"
however
,
I
have
take
her
at
her
word
,

have
send
Partridge
to
look
for
another
lodging

<EOS>
"
if
you
will

Nightingale
,
"
we
may
,
I
believe
,
be
again
together

for
,
to
tell
you
a
secret

which
I
desire
you
will
not
mention
in

I
intend

day

give
you
warn
too

my
friend

cry
Jones
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
"
answer
the
other
;
"
but
the
room
be
not
convenient
enough
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
be
grow
weary
of
this
part
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
be
nearer
the
place
of
diversion

I
be
go
to
Pall

mall

do
you
intend

make
a
secret
of
your
go
away

Jones
.
<EOS>
"
I
promise
you
,
"
answer
Nightingale
,
"
I
do
not
intend
to
bilk
my
lodging

I
have
a
private
reason
for
not
take
a
formal
leave
.
"
<EOS>
"
not
so
private
,
"
answer
Jones
;
"
I
promise
you
,
I
have
see
it
ever
since
the
second
day
of
my
come
to
the
house

<EOS>
here
will
be
some
wet
eye
on
your
departure

<EOS>
poor
Nancy
,
I
pity
her
,
faith
!
<EOS>
indeed
,
Jack
,
you
have
play
the
fool
with
that
girl
.
<EOS>
You
have
give
her
a
longing
,
which
I
be
afraid
nothing
will
ever
cure
her
of
.
"
<EOS>
Nightingale
answer
,
"
what
the
devil
would
you
have
me
do
?
<EOS>
would
you
have
me
marry
her
to
cure
her
?
"
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
answer
Jones
,
"
I
would
not
have
have
you
make
love
to
her
,
as
you
have
often
do
in
my
presence
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
astonish
at
the
blindness
of
her
mother
in
never
see
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
pugh
,
see
it
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Nightingale
.
<EOS>
"
what
,
the
devil
should
she
see
?
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
see
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
that
you
have
make
her
daughter
distractedly
in
love
with
you
.
<EOS>
the
poor
girl
can
not
conceal
it
a
moment
;
her
eye
be
never
off
from
you
,
and
she
always
colour
every
time
you
come
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
pity
her
heartily
;
for
she
seem
to
be
one
of
the
best
-
natured
and
honest
of
human
creature
.
"
<EOS>
"
and
so
,
"
answer
Nightingale
,
"
accord
to
your
doctrine
,
one
must
not
amuse
oneself
by
any
common
gallantry
with
woman
,
for
fear
they
should
fall
in
love
with
us
.
"
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
Jack
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
you
wilfully
misunderstand
me
;
I
do
not
fancy
woman
be
so
apt
to
fall
in
love
;
but
you
have
go
far
beyond
common
gallantry
.
"
<EOS>
"
what
,
do
you
suppose
,
"
say
Nightingale
,
"
that
we
have
be
a
-
bed
together
?
"
<EOS>
"
no
,
upon
my
honour
,
"
answer
Jones
,
very
seriously
,
"
I
do
not
suppose
so
ill
of
you
;
nay
,
I
will
go
farther
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
imagine
you
have
lay
a
regular
premeditated
scheme
for
the
destruction
of
the
quiet
of
a
poor
little
creature
,
or
have
even
foresee
the
consequence
:
for
I
be
sure
thou
art
a
very
good
-
natured
fellow
;
and
such
a
one
can
never
be
guilty
of
a
cruelty
of
that
kind
;
but
at
the
same
time
you
have
please
your
own
vanity
,
without
consider
that
this
poor
girl
be
make
a
sacrifice
to
it
;
and
while
you
have
have
no
design
but
of
amuse
an
idle
hour
,
you
have
actually
give
her
reason
to
flatter
herself
that
you
have
the
most
serious
design
in
her
favour
.
<EOS>
Prithee
,
Jack
,
answer
me
honestly
;
to
what
have
tend
all
those
elegant
and
luscious
description
of
happiness
arise
from
violent
and
mutual

I

therefore
,
you

not

<EOS>
Jones
promise
he
would
not
;
and
say
,
upon
reflection
,
he
think
,
as
he
have
determine
and
be
oblige
to
leave
her
,
he
take
the
most
prudent
method
.
<EOS>
He
then
tell
Nightingale
he
should
be
very
glad
to
lodge
in
the
same
house
with
him
;
and
it
be
accordingly
agree
between
them
,
that
Nightingale
should
procure
him
either
the
ground
floor
,
or
the
two
pair
of
stair
;
for
the
young
gentleman
himself
be
to
occupy
that
which
be
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
this
Nightingale
,
of
whom
we
shall
be
presently
oblige
to
say
a
little
more
,
be
in
the
ordinary
transaction
of
life
a
man
of
strict
honour
,
and
,
what
be
more
rare
among
young
gentleman
of
the
town
,
one
of
strict
honesty
too
;
yet
in
affair
of
love
he
be
somewhat
loose
in
his
moral
;
not
that
he
be
even
here
as
void
of
principle
as
gentleman
sometimes
be
,
and
oftener
affect
to
be
;
but
it
be
certain
he
have
be
guilty
of
some
indefensible
treachery
to
woman
,
and
have
,
in
a
certain
mystery
,
call
make
love
,
practise
many
deceit
,
which
,
if
he
have
use
in
trade
,
he
would
have
be
count
the
great
villain
upon
earth
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
the
world
,
I
know
not
well
for
what
reason
,
agree
to
see
this
treachery
in
a
well
light
,
he
be
so
far
from
be
ashamed
of
his
iniquity
of
this
kind
,
that
he
glory
in
them
,
and
would
often
boast
of
his
skill
in
gain
of
woman
,
and
his
triumph
over
their
heart
,
for
which
he
have
before
this
time
receive
some
rebuke
from
Jones
,
who
always
exprest
great
bitterness
against
any
misbehaviour
to
the
fair
part
of
the
specie
,
who
,
if
consider
,
he
say
,
as
they
ought
to
be
,
in
the
light
of
the
dear
friend
,
be
to
be
cultivate
,
honour
,
and
caress
with
the
utmost
love
and
tenderness
;
but
,
if
regard
as
enemy
,
be
a
conquest
of
which
a
man
ought
rather
to
be
ashamed
than
to
value
himself
upon
it
.
    
<EOS>
a
short
account
of
the
history
of
Mrs
Miller
.
 
<EOS>
Jones
this
day
eat
a
pretty
good
dinner
for
a
sick
man
,
that
be
to
say
,
the
large
half
of
a
shoulder
of
mutton
.
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
he
receive
an
invitation
from
Mrs
Miller
to
drink
tea
;
for
that
good
woman
,
have
learn
,
either
by
mean
of
Partridge
,
or
by
some
other
mean
natural
or
supernatural
,
that
he
have
a
connexion
with
Mr
Allworthy
,
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
part
with
him
in
an
angry
manner
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
accept
the
invitation
;
and
no
sooner
be
the
tea
-
kettle
remove
,
and
the
girl
send
out
of
the
room
,
than
the
widow
,
without
much
preface
,
begin
as
follow
:
"
<EOS>
well
,
there
be
very
surprize
thing
happen
in
this
world
;
but
certainly
it
be
a
wonderful
business
that
I
should
have
a
relation
of
Mr
Allworthy
in
my
house
,
and
never
know
anything
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
sir
,
you
little
imagine
what
a
friend
that
good
of
gentleman
hath
be
to
me
and
mine
.
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
,
I
be
not
ashamed
to
own
it
;
it
be
owe
to
his
goodness
that
I
do
not
long
since
perish
for
want
,
and
leave
my
poor
little
wretch
,
two
destitute
,
helpless
,
friendless
orphan
,
to
the
care
,
or
rather
to
the
cruelty
,
of
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
,
sir
,
though
I
be
now
reduce
to
get
my
living
by
let
lodging
,
I
be
bear
and
breed
a
gentlewoman
.
<EOS>
My
father
be
an
officer
of
the
army
,
and
die
in
a
considerable
rank
:
but
he
live
up
to
his
pay
;
and
,
as
that
expire
with
him
,
his
family
,
at
his
death
,
become
beggar
.
<EOS>
We
be
three
sister
.
<EOS>
one
of
us
have
the
good
luck
to
die
soon
after
of
the
small
-
pox
;
a
lady
be
so
kind
as
to
take
the
second
out
of
charity
,
as
she
say
,
to
wait
upon
her
.
<EOS>
the
mother
of
this
lady
have
be
a
servant
to
my
grand
-
mother
;
and
,
have
inherit
a
vast
fortune
from
her
father
,
which
he
have
get
by
pawnbroke
,
be
marry
to
a
gentleman
of
great
estate
and
fashion
.
<EOS>
She
use
my
sister
so
barbarously
,
often
upbraid
her
with
her
birth
and
poverty
,
call
her
in
derision
<EOS>
a
gentlewoman
,
that
I
believe
she
at
length
break
the
heart
of
the
poor
girl
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
she
likewise
die
within
a
twelvemonth
after
my
father
.
<EOS>
Fortune
think
proper
to
provide
better
for
me
,
and
within
a
month
from
his
decease
I
be
married
to
a
clergyman
,
who
have
be
my
lover
a
long
time
before
,
and
who
have
be
very
ill
use
by
my
father
on
that
account
:
for
though
my
poor
father
could
not
give
any
of
us
a
shilling
,
yet
he
breed
us
up
as
delicately
,
consider
us
,
and
would
have
have
us
consider
ourselves
,
as
highly
as
if
we
have
be
the
rich
heiress
.
<EOS>
but
my
dear
husband
forget
all
this
usage
,
and
the
moment
we
be
become
fatherless
he
immediately
renew
his
address
to
me
so
warmly
,
that
I
,
who
always
like
,
and
now
more
than
ever
esteem
him
,
soon
comply
.
<EOS>
five
year
do
I
live
in
a
state
of
perfect
happiness
with
that
good
of
man
,
till
at
last
 
<EOS>
oh
!
cruel
!
<EOS>
cruel
fortune
,
that
ever
separate
us
,
that
deprive
me
of
the
kind
of
husband
and
my
poor
girl
of
the
tender
parent
.
 
<EOS>
o
my
poor
girl
!
<EOS>
you
never
know
the
blessing
which
ye
lose
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
ashamed
,
Mr
Jones
,
of
this
womanish
weakness
;
but
I
shall
never
mention
him
without
tear

<EOS>
"
I
ought
rather
,
madam

Jones

easy
credit
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Miller
believe
all
which
Jones
tell
her
to
be
true
,
and
expr
much
pity
and
concern
for
him
.
<EOS>
She
be
begin
to
comment
on
the
story
,
but
Jones
interrupt
her
;
for
,
as
the
hour
of
assignation
now
draw
nigh
,
he
begin
to
stipulate
for
a
second
interview
with
the
lady
that
evening
,
which
he
promise
should
be
the
last
at
her
house
;
swear
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
she
be
one
of
great
distinction
,
and
that
nothing
but
what
be
intirely
innocent
be
to
pass
between
them
;
and
I
do
firmly
believe
he
intend
to
keep
his
word
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Miller
be
at
length
prevail
on
,
and
Jones
depart
to
his
chamber
,
where
he
sit
alone
till
twelve
o'clock
,
but
no
Lady
Bellaston
appear
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
have
say
that
this
lady
have
a
great
affection
for
Jones
,
and
as
it
must
have
appear
that
she
really
have
so
,
the
reader
may
perhaps
wonder
at
the
first
failure
of
her
appointment
,
as
she
apprehend
him
to
be
confine
by
sickness
,
a
season
when
friendship
seem
most
to
require
such
visit
.
<EOS>
this
behaviour
,
therefore
,
in
the
lady
,
may
,
by
some
,
be
condemn
as
unnatural
;
but
that
be
not
our
fault
;
for
our
business
be
only
to
record
truth
.
    
<EOS>
contain
a
scene
which
we
doubt
not
will
affect
all
our
reader
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jones
close
not
his
eye
during
all
the
former
part
of
the
night
;
not
owe
to
any
uneasiness
which
he
conceive
at
be
disappoint
by
Lady
Bellaston
;
nor
be
Sophia
herself
,
though
most
of
his
wake
hour
be
justly
to
be
charge
to
her
account
,
the
present
cause
of
dispel
his
slumber
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
poor
Jones
be
one
of
the
best
-
natured
fellow
alive
,
and
have
all
that
weakness
which
be
call
compassion
,
and
which
distinguish
this
imperfect
character
from
that
noble
firmness
of
mind
,
which
roll
a
man
,
as
it
be
,
within
himself
,
and
like
a
polished
bowl
,
enable
him
to
run
through
the
world
without
be
once
stop
by
the
calamity
which
happen
to
other
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
help
,
therefore
,
compassionate
the
situation
of
poor
Nancy
,
whose
love
for
Mr
Nightingale
seem
to
him
so
apparent
,
that
he
be
astonish
at
the
blindness
of
her
mother
,
who
have
more
than
once
,
the
precede
evening
,
<EOS>
remark
to
him
the
great
change
in
the
temper
of
her
daughter

at

and
now
,
as
if
he
have
already
be
a
deity
,
as
the
antient
imagine
,
and
an
offend
one
too
,
he
seem
to
enjoy
his

<EOS>
to
speak
simply
,
and
without
any
metaphor
,
Mr
Jones
sleep
till
eleven
the
next
morning
,
and
would
,
perhaps
,
have
continue
in
the
same
quiet
situation
much
longer
,
have
not
a
violent
uproar
awaken
him
.
  
<EOS>

"
<EOS>
Jones
express
much
concern
at
this
news
;
which
Partridge
endeavour
to
relieve
,
by
say
,
with
a
smile
,
"

<EOS>
in

say
he
,
"
Miss

hath
have
a
mind
to

He

himself
as

notwithstanding
many

,
I
be
afraid
,
will
  
be
no

shocking
to
you

the

may

summon
all

forgive
and
forget
the

nothing

the
prospect
of

ruin
could
have

when
Jones
have
read
this
letter

they
both
stand
silent
during
a
minute
,
look
at
each
other
;
at
last
he
begin
thus
:
"
I
can
not
express
,
madam

<EOS>
how
much
I
be
shock
at
what
I
have
read
;
yet
let
me
beg
you
,
in
one
particular
,
to
take
the
writer
's
advice
.
<EOS>
consider
the
reputation
of
your
daughter
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
go
,
it
be
lose

"
cry
she
,

as
well
as
her
innocence

<EOS>
She
receive
the
letter
in
a
room
full
of
company
,
and
immediately
swoon
away
upon
open
it

the
content
be
know
to
every

present

<EOS>
but
the
loss
of
her
reputation
,
bad
as
it
be

be
not
the
bad
;
I
shall
lose
my
child
;
she
hath
attempt
twice
to
destroy
herself
already
;
and
though
she
hath
be
hitherto
prevent

vow
she
will
not
outlive
it

could
I
myself
outlive
any
accident

<EOS>
what
then
will
become
of
my
little
Betsy
,
a
helpless
infant
orphan
?
<EOS>
and
the
poor
little
wretch
will
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
break
her
heart
at
the
misery
with
which
she
see
her
sister

myself
distract

while
she
be
ignorant

be
this
the
reward

have
I

have
I
be

so
many

deny
myself

the

provide
some
little

"
indeed

Jones

with
tear
in

I

cry

immediately
obey
the
summon

first
order
Betsy
to
stay
with
Mr

beg
him
to
entertain
her
a
few
minute

say
,
in

most
pathetic
voice

"
Good

preserve

<EOS>
Jones
,
in
compliance
with
this
request

do
all
he
could
to
comfort
the
little
girl

though
he
be

in
reality
,
himself
very
highly
affected
with
Mrs

story

<EOS>
He
tell
her
"
Her

would
be
soon
very
well
again

that
by
take
on
in

manner

make
her

worse

make
her
mother
ill
too

<EOS>
"
indeed

sir

"
say
she
,
"
I
would
not
do
anything
to
hurt
them
for
the

<EOS>
I
would
burst
my
heart
rather
than
they
should
see
me
cry

my
poor

can
not
see
me
cry

<EOS>
I
be
afraid

indeed

I
can
not

what
will
become

Jones
.
<EOS>
"
yes

"
answer
she
,
"
I
be
always
afraid
to
die

because
I
must
have
leave

be
well
,
and
long
to
see
you
.

<EOS>
She
then
turn
to
Jones
,
and
begin
to
renew
her
apology
for
have
disappoint
him
of
his
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
madam
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
I
shall
have
a
more
exquisite
repast
than
any
you
could
have
provide
for
me

this
,
I
assure
you
,
will
be
the
case
,
if
I
can
do
any
service
to
this
little
family
of
love

<EOS>
but
whatever
success
may
attend
my
endeavour
,
I
be
resolve
to
attempt
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
deceive
in
Mr
Nightingale
,
if
,
notwithstanding
what
hath
happen
,
he
hath
not
much
goodness
of
heart
at
the
bottom
,
as
well
as
a
very
violent
affection
for
your
daughter
.
<EOS>
if
this
be
the
case
,
I
think
the
picture
which
I
shall
lay
before
him
will
affect
him
.

Endeavour
,
madam
,
to
comfort
yourself
,
and
Miss
Nancy
,
as
well
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
instantly
in
quest
of
Mr
Nightingale
;
and
I
hope
to
bring
you
good
news
.

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Miller
fall
upon
her
knee
and
invoke
all
the
blessing
of
heaven
upon
Mr
Jones
;
to
which
she
afterwards
add
the
most
passionate
expression
of
gratitude
.
<EOS>
He
then
depart
to
find
Mr
Nightingale
,
and
the
good
woman
return
to
comfort
her
daughter
,
who
be
somewhat
cheare
at
what
her
mother
tell
her
;
and
both
join
in
resound
the
praise
of
Mr
Jones
.
    
<EOS>
the
interview
between
Mr
Jones
and
Mr
Nightingale
.
 
<EOS>
the
good
or
evil
we
confer
on
other
very
often
,
I
believe
,
recoil
on
ourselves
.
<EOS>
for
as
man
of
a
benign
disposition
enjoy
their
own
act
of
beneficence
equally
with
those
to
whom
they
be
do
,
so
there
be
scarce
any
nature
so
entirely
diabolical
,
as
to
be
capable
of
do
injury
,
without
pay
themselves
some
pang
for
the
ruin
which
they
bring
on
their
fellow
-
creature
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Nightingale
,
at
least
,
be
not
such
a
person
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
Jones
find
him
in
his
new
lodging
,
sit
melancholy
by
the
fire
,
and
silently
lament
the
unhappy
situation
in
which
he
have
place
poor
Nancy
.
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
see
his
friend
appear
than
he
arise
hastily
to
meet
him
;
and
after
much
congratulation
say
,
"
nothing
could
be
more
opportune
than
this
kind
visit
;
for
I
be
never
more
in
the
spleen
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
,
"
answer
Jones
,
"
that
I
bring
news
very
unlikely
to
relieve
you
:
<EOS>
nay
,
what
I
be
convince
<EOS>
must
,
of
all
other
,
shock
you
the
most
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
necessary
you
should
know
it
.
<EOS>
without
further
preface
,
then
,
I
come
to
you
,
Mr
Nightingale
,
from
a
worthy
family
,
which
you
have
involve
in
misery
and
ruin
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Nightingale
change
colour
at
these
word
;
but
Jones
,
without
regard
it
,
proceed
,
in
the
lively
manner
,
to
paint
the
tragical
story
with
which
the
reader
be
acquaint
in
the
last
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
Nightingale
never
once
interrupt
the
narration
,
though
he
discover
violent
emotion
at
many
part
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
when
it
be
conclude
,
after
fetch
a
deep
sigh
,
he
say
,
"
what
you
tell
me
,
my
friend
,
affect
me
in
the
tender
manner
.
<EOS>
sure
there
never
be
so
curse
an
accident
as
the
poor
girl
's
betray
my
letter
.
<EOS>
Her
reputation
may
otherwise
have
be
safe
,
and
the
affair
may
have
remain
a
profound
secret
;
and
then
the
girl
may
have
go
off
never
the
bad
;
for
many
such
thing
happen
in
this
town
:
and
if
the
husband
should
suspect
a
little
,
when
it
be
too
late
,
it
will
be
his
wise
conduct
to
conceal
his
suspicion
both
from
his
wife
and
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
my
friend
,
"
answer
Jones
,
"
this
could
not
have
be
the
case
with
your
poor
Nancy
.
<EOS>
You
have
so
entirely
gain
her
affection
,
that
it
be
the
loss
of
you
,
and
not
of
her
reputation
,
which
afflict
her
,
and
will
end
in
the
destruction
of
her
and
her
family
.
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
for
that
matter
,
I
promise
you
,
"
cry
Nightingale
,
"
she
hath
my
affection
so
absolutely
,
that
my
wife
,
whoever
she
be
to
be
,
will
have
very
little
share
in
them
.
"
<EOS>
"
and
be
it
possible
then
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
you
can
think
of
desert
her
?
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
what
can
I
do
?
"
answer
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
ask
Miss
Nancy
,
"
reply
Jones
warmly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
the
condition
to
which
you
have
reduce
her
,
I
sincerely
think
she
ought
to
determine
what
reparation
you
shall
make
her
.
<EOS>
Her
interest
alone
,
and
not
yours
,
ought
to
be
your
sole
consideration
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
ask
me
what
you
shall
do
,
what
can
you
do
less
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
than
fulfil
the
expectation
of
her
family
,
and
her
own
?
<EOS>
nay
,
I
sincerely
tell
you
,
they
be
mine
too
,
ever
since
I
first
see
you
together
.
<EOS>
You
will
pardon
me
if
I
presume
on
the
friendship
you
have
favour
me
with
,
move
as
I
be
with
compassion
for
those
poor
creature
.
<EOS>
but
your
own
heart
will
best
suggest
to
you
,
whether
you
have
never
intend
,
by
your
conduct
,
to
persuade
the
mother
,
as
well
as
the
daughter
,
into
an
opinion
,
that
you
design
honourably
:
and
if
so
,
though
there
may
have
be
no
direct
promise
of
marriage
in
the
case
,
I
will
leave
to
your
own
good
understanding
,
how
far
you
be
bind
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
must
not
only
confess
what
you
have
hint
,
"
say
Nightingale
;
"
but
I
be
afraid
<EOS>
even
that
very
promise
you
mention
I
have
give
.
"
<EOS>
"
and
can
you
,
after
own
that
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
hesitate
a
moment
?
"
<EOS>
"
consider
,
my
friend
,
"
answer
the
other
;
"
I
know
you
be
a
man
of
honour
,
and
would
advise
no
one
to
act
contrary
to
its
rule
;
if
there
be
no
other
objection
,
can
I
,
after
this
publication
of
her
disgrace
,
think
of
such
an
alliance
with
honour
?
"
<EOS>
"
undoubtedly
,
"
reply
Jones
,
"
and
the
very
good
and
true
honour
,
which
be
goodness
,
require
it
of
you
.
<EOS>
as
you
mention
a
scruple
of
this
kind
,
you
will
give
me
leave
to
examine
it
.
<EOS>
Can
you
with
honour
be
guilty
of
have
under
false
pretence
deceive
a
young
woman
and
her
family
,
and
of
have
by
these
mean
treacherously
rob
her
of
her
innocence
?
<EOS>
Can
you
,
with
honour
,
be
the
knowing
,
the
wilful
occasion
,
nay
,
the
artful
contriver
of
the
ruin
of
a
human
being
?
<EOS>
Can
you
,
with
honour
,
destroy
the
fame
,
the
peace
,
nay
,
probably
,
both
the
life
and
soul
too
,
of
this
creature
?
<EOS>
Can
honour
bear
the
thought
,
that
this
creature
be
a
tender
,
helpless
,
defenceless
,
young
woman
?
<EOS>
a
young
woman
,
who
love
,
who
doat
on
you
,
who
die
for
you
;
who
hath
place
the
utmost
confidence
in
your
promise
;
and
to
that
confidence
hath
sacrifice
everything
which
be
dear
to
her
?
<EOS>
Can
honour
support
such
contemplation
as
these
a
moment
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
common
sense
,
indeed
,
"
say
Nightingale
,
"
warrant
all
you
say
;
but
yet
you
well
know
the
opinion
of
the
world
be
so
contrary
to
it
,
that
,
be
I
to
marry
a
whore
,
though
my
own
,
I
should
be
ashamed
of
ever
show
my
face
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
fie
upon
it
,
Mr
Nightingale
!
<EOS>
"
say
Jones
,
"
do
not
call
her
by
so
ungenerous
a
name
:
when
you
promise
to
marry
her
<EOS>
she
become
your
wife
;
and
she
hath
sin
more
against
prudence
than
virtue
.
<EOS>
and
what
be
this
world
which
you
would
be
ashamed
to
face
but
the
vile
,
the
foolish
,
and
the
profligate
?
<EOS>
forgive
me
if
I
say
such
a
shame
must
proceed
from
false
modesty
,
which
always
attend
false
honour
as
its
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
well
assured
there
be
not
a
man
of
real
sense
and
goodness
in
the
world
who
would
not
honour
and
applaud
the
action
.
<EOS>
but
,
admit
no
other
would
,
would
not
your
own
heart
,
my
friend
,
applaud
it
?
<EOS>
and
do
not
the
warm
,
rapturous
sensation
,
which
we
feel
from
the
consciousness
of
an
honest
,
noble
,
generous
,
benevolent
action
,
convey
more
delight
to
the
mind
than
the
undeserved
praise
of
million
?
<EOS>
set
the
alternative
fairly
before
your
eye
.
<EOS>
on
the
one
side
,
see
this
poor
,
unhappy
,
tender
,
believe
girl
,
in
the
arm
of
her
wretched
mother
,
breathe
her
last
.
<EOS>
hear
her
break
heart
in
agony
,
sigh
out
your
name
;
and
lamenting
,
rather
than
accuse
,
the
cruelty
which
weigh
her
down
to
destruction
.
<EOS>
paint
to
your
imagination
the
circumstance
of
her
fond
despairing
parent
,
drive
to
madness
,
or
,
perhaps
,
to
death
,
by
the
loss
of
her
lovely
daughter
.
<EOS>
view
the
poor
,
helpless
,
orphan
infant
;
and
when
your
mind
hath
dwell
a
moment
only
on
such
idea
,
consider
yourself
as
the
cause
of
all
the
ruin
of
this
poor
,
little
,
worthy
,
defenceless
family
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
side
,
consider
yourself
as
relieve
them
from
their
temporary
suffering
.
<EOS>
think
with
what
joy
,
with
what
transport
that
lovely
creature
will
fly
to
your
arm
.
<EOS>
see
her
blood
return
to
her
pale
cheek
,
her
fire
to
her
languid
eye
,
and
rapture
to
her
tortured
breast
.
<EOS>
consider
the
exultation
of
her
mother
,
the
happiness
of
all
.
<EOS>
think
of
this
little
family
make
by
one
act
of
yours
completely
happy
.
<EOS>
think
of
this
alternative
,
and
sure
I
be
mistaken
in
my
friend
if
it
require
any
long
deliberation
whether
he
will
sink
these
wretch
down
for
ever
,
or
,
by
one
generous
,
noble
resolution
,
raise
them
all
from
the
brink
of
misery
and
despair
to
the
high
pitch
of
human
happiness
.
<EOS>
add
to
this
but
one
consideration
more
;
the
consideration
that
it
be
your
duty
so
to
do
 
that
the
misery
from
which
you
will
relieve
these
poor
people
be
the
misery
which
you
yourself
have
wilfully
bring
upon
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
o
,
my
dear
friend
!
"
cry
Nightingale
,
"
I
want
not
your
eloquence
to
rouse
me
.
<EOS>
I
pity
poor
Nancy
from
my
soul
,
and
would
willingly
give
anything
in
my
power
that
no
familiarity
have
ever
pass
between
us
.
<EOS>
nay
,
believe
me
,
I
have
many
struggle
with
my
passion
before
I
could
prevail
with
myself
to
write
that
cruel
letter
,
which
hath
cause
all
the
misery
in
that
unhappy
family
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
no
inclination
to
consult
but
<EOS>
my
own
,
I
would
marry
her
to
-
morrow
morning
:
<EOS>
I
would
,
by
heaven
!
<EOS>
but
you
will
easily
imagine
how
impossible
it
would
be
to
prevail
on
my
father
to
consent
to
such
a
match
;
besides
,
he
hath
provide
another
for
me
;

to
-
morrow
,
by
his
express
command
,
I
be
to
wait
on
the
lady
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
honour
to
know
your
father
,
"
say
Jones
;
"
but
,
suppose
he
could
be
persuade
,
would
you
yourself
consent
to
the
only
mean
of
preserve
these
poor
people
?
"
<EOS>
"
as
eagerly
as
I
would
pursue
my
happiness

answer
Nightingale
:
"
for
I
never
shall
find
it
in
any
other

<EOS>
o
,
my
dear
friend
!
<EOS>
could
you
imagine
what
I
have
feel
within
these
twelve
hour
for
my
poor
girl

I
be
convinced
she
would
not
engross
all
your
pity

<EOS>
passion
lead
me
only
to
her
;
and
,
if
I
have
any
foolish
scruple
of
honour
,
you
have
fully
satisfy
them
:
could
my
father
be
induce
to
comply
with
my
desire
,
nothing
would
be
want
to
compleat
my
own
happiness
or
that
of
my
Nancy

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
be
resolve
to
undertake
it
,
"
say
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
be
angry
with
me
,
in
whatever
light
it
may
be
necessary
to
set
this
affair
,
which
,
you
may
depend
on
it
,
could
not
otherwise
be
long
hide
from
him
:
<EOS>
for
thing
of
this
nature
make
a
quick
progress
when
once
they
get
abroad
,
as
this
unhappily
hath
already
.
<EOS>
besides
,
should
any
fatal
accident
follow
,
as
upon
my
soul
I
be
afraid
will
,
unless
immediately
prevent
,
the
public
would
ring
of
your
name
in
a
manner
which
,
if
your
father
hath
common
humanity
,
must
offend
him
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
therefore
tell
me
where
I
may
find
the
old
gentleman

I
will
not
lose
a
moment
in
the
business
;
which
,
while
I
pursue
,
you
can
not
do
a
more
generous
action

by
pay
a
visit
to
the
poor
girl

You
will
find
I
have
not
exaggerate
in
the
account
I
have
give
of
the
wretchedness
of
the
family

"
  
<EOS>
Nightingale
immediately
consent
to
the
proposal
;
and
now
,
have
acquaint
Jones
with
his
father
's
lodging
,
and
the
coffee
-
house
where
he
would
most
probably
find
him
,
he
hesitate
a
moment
,
and
then
say
,
"
My
dear
Tom
,
you
be
go
to
undertake
an
impossibility

<EOS>
if
you
know
my
father
you

never

obtain
his
consent

<EOS>
Stay
,
there
be
one
way
 
<EOS>
suppose
you
tell
him
I
be
already
married
,
it
may
be
easy
to
reconcile
him
to
the
fact
after
it
be
do
;
and
,
upon
my
honour

I
be
so
affected
with
what
you
have
say

I
love
my
Nancy
so
passionately

I
almost
wish

whatever
may

<EOS>
Jones
greatly
approve
the
hint
,
and
promise
to
pursue
it
.
<EOS>
They
then
separate
,
Nightingale
to
visit
his
Nancy
,
and
Jones
in
quest
of
the
old
gentleman
.
    
<EOS>
what
pass
between
Jones
and
old
Mr
Nightingale
;
with
the
arrival
of
a
person
not
yet
mention
in
this
history
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
sentiment
of
the
roman
satirist
,
which
deny
the
divinity
of
fortune
,
and
the
opinion
of
Seneca
to
the
same
purpose
;
Cicero
,
who
be
,
I
believe
,
a
wise
man
than
either
of
them
,
expressly
hold
the
contrary
;
and
certain
it
be
,
there
be
some
incident
in
life
so
very
strange
and
unaccountable
,
that
it
seem
to
require
more
than
human
skill
and
foresight
in
produce
them
.
  
<EOS>
of
this
kind
be
what
now
happen
to
Jones
,
who
find
Mr
Nightingale
the
elder
in
so
critical
a
minute
,
that
Fortune
,
if
she
be
really
worthy
all
the
worship
she
receive
at
Rome
,
could
not
have
contrive
such
another
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
old
gentleman
,
and
the
father
of
the
young
lady
whom
he
intend
for
his
son
,
have
be
hard
at
it
for
many
hour
;
and
the
latter
be
just
now
go
,
and
have
leave
the
former
delight
with
the
thought
that
he
have
succeed
in
a
long
contention
,
which
have
be
between
the
two
father
of
the
future
bride
and
bridegroom
;
in
which
both
endeavour
to
overreach
the
other
,
and
,
as
it
not
rarely
happen
in
such
case
,
both
have
retreat
fully
satisfied
of
have
obtain
the
victory
.
  
<EOS>
this
gentleman
,
whom
Mr
Jones
now
visit
,
be
what
they
call
a
man
of
the
world
;
that
be
to
say
,
a
man
who
direct
his
conduct
in
this
world
as
one
who
,
be
fully
persuade
there
be
no
other
,
be
resolve
to
make
the
most
of
this
.
<EOS>
in
his
early
year
he
have
be
breed
to
trade
;
but
,
have
acquire
a
very
good
fortune
,
he
have
lately
decline
his
business
;
or
,
to
speak
more
properly
,
have
change
it
from
deal
in
good
,
to
deal
only
in
money
,
of
which
he
have
always
a
plentiful
fund
at
command
,
and
of
which
he
know
very
well
how
to
make
a
very
plentiful
advantage
,
sometimes
of
the
necessity
of
private
man
,
and
sometimes
of
those
of
the
public
.
<EOS>
He
have
indeed
converse
so
entirely
with
money
,
that
it
may
be
almost
doubt
whether
he
imagine
there
be
any
other
thing
really
exist
in
the
world
;
this
at
least
may
be
certainly
aver
,
that
he
firmly
believe
nothing
else
to
have
any
real
value
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
will
,
I
fancy
,
allow
that
Fortune
could
not
have
cull
out
a
more
improper
person
for
Mr
Jones
to
attack
with
any
probability
of
success
;
nor
could
the
whimsical
lady
have
direct
this
attack
at
a
more
unseasonable
time
.
  
<EOS>
as
money
then
be
always
uppermost
in
this
gentleman
's
thought
,
so
the
moment
he
see
a
stranger
within
his
door
it
immediately
occur
to
his
imagination
,
that
such
stranger
be
either
come
to
bring
him
money
,
or
to
fetch
it
from
him
.
<EOS>
and
accord
as
one
or
other
of
these
thought
prevail
,
he
conceive
a
favourable
or
unfavourable
idea
of
the
person
who
approach
him
.
  
<EOS>
Unluckily
for
Jones
<EOS>
,
the
latter
of
these
be
the
ascendant
at
present
;
for
as
a
young
gentleman
have
visit
him
the
day
before
,
with
a
bill
from
his
son
for
a
play
debt
,
he
apprehend
,
at
the
first
sight
of
Jones
,
that
he
be
come
on
such
another
errand
.
<EOS>
Jones
therefore
have
no
sooner
tell
him
that
he
be
come
on
his
son
's
account
than
the
old
gentleman
,
be
confirm
in
his
suspicion
,
burst
forth
into
an
exclamation
,
"
that
he
would
lose
his
labour
.
"
<EOS>
"
be
it
then
possible
,
sir
,
"
answer
Jones
,
"
that
you
can
guess
my
business
?
"
<EOS>
"
if
I
do
guess
it
,
"
reply
the
other
,
"
I
repeat
again
to
you
,
you
will
lose
your
labour
.
<EOS>
what
,
I
suppose
you
be
one
of
those
spark
who
lead
my
son
into
all
those
scene
of
riot
and
debauchery
,
which
will
be
his
destruction
?
<EOS>
but
I
shall
pay
no
more
of
his
bill
,
I
promise
you
.
<EOS>
I
expect
he
will
quit
all
such
company
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
imagine
otherwise
,
I
should
not
have
provide
a
wife
for
him
;
for
I
would
be
instrumental
in
the
ruin
of
nobody
.
"
<EOS>
"
how
,
sir
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
and
be
this
lady
of
your
providing
?
"
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
sir
,
"
answer
the
old
gentleman
,
"
how
come
it
to
be
any
concern
of
yours
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
dear
sir
,
"
reply
Jones
,
"
be
not
offend
that
I
interest
myself
in
what
regard
your
son
's
happiness
,
for
whom
I
have
so
great
an
honour
and
value
.
<EOS>
It
be
upon
that
very
account
<EOS>
I
come
to
wait
upon
you
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
express
the
satisfaction
you
have
give
me
by
what
you
say
;
for
I
do
assure
you
your
son
be
a
person
for
whom
I
have
the
high
honour
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
sir
,
it
be
not
easy
to
express
the
esteem
I
have
for
you
;
who
could
be
so
generous
,
so
good
,
so
kind
,
so
indulgent
to
provide
such
a
match
for
your
son
;
a
woman
,
who
,
I
dare
swear
,
will
make
him
one
of
the
happy
man
upon
earth
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
scarce
anything
which
so
happily
introduce
man
to
our
good
liking
,
as
have
conceive
some
alarm
at
their
first
appearance
;
when
once
those
apprehension
begin
to
vanish
we
soon
forget
the
fear
which
they
occasion
,
and
look
on
ourselves
as
indebted
for
our
present
ease
to
those
very
person
who
at
first
raise
our
fear
.
  
<EOS>
thus
it
happen
to
Nightingale
,
who
no
sooner
find
that
Jones
have
no
demand
on
him
,
as
he
suspect
,
than
he
begin
to
be
pleased
with
his
presence
.
<EOS>
"
pray
,
good
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
be
pleased
to
sit
down
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
to
have
ever
have
the
pleasure
of
see
you
before
;
but
if
you
be
a
friend
of
my
son
,
and
have
anything
to
say
concern
this
young
lady
,
I
shall
be
glad
to
hear
you
.
<EOS>
as
to
her
make
him
happy
,
it
will
be
his
own
fault
if
she
doth
not
.
<EOS>
I
have
discharge
my
duty
,
in
take
care
of
the
main
article
.
<EOS>
She
will
bring
him
a
fortune
capable
of
make
any
reasonable
,
prudent
,
sober
man
,
happy
.
"
<EOS>
"
undoubtedly
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
for
she
be
in
herself
a
fortune
;
so
beautiful
,
so
genteel
,
so
sweet
-
tempered
,
and
so
well
-
educate
;
she
be
indeed
a
most
accomplished
young
lady
;
sing
admirably
well
,
and
hath
a
most
delicate
hand
at
the
harpsichord
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
any
of
these
matter
,
"
answer
the
old
gentleman
,
"
for
I
never
see
the
lady
:
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
like
her
the
bad
for
what
you
tell
me
;
and
I
be
the
better
pleased
with
her
father
for
not
lay
any
stress
on
these
qualification
in
our
bargain
.
<EOS>
I
shall
always
think
it
a
proof
of
his
understanding
.
<EOS>
a
silly
fellow
would
have
bring
in
these
article
as
an
addition
to
her
fortune
;
but
,
to
give
him
his
due
,
he
never
mention
any
such
matter
;
though
to
be
sure
they
be
no
disparagement
to
a
woman
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
assure
you
,
sir
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
she
hath
them
all
in
the
most
eminent
degree
:
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
own
I
be
afraid
you
may
have
be
a
little
backward
,
a
little
less
inclined
to
the
match
;
for
your
son
tell
me
you
have
never
see
the
lady
;
therefore
I
come
,
sir
,
in
that
case
,
to
entreat
you
,
to
conjure
you
,
as
you
value
the
happiness
of
your
son
,
not
to
be
averse
to
his
match
with
a
woman
who
hath
not
only
all
the
good
quality
I
have
mention
,
but
many
more
.

"
 
<EOS>
"
if
that
be
your
business
,
sir
,
"
say
the
old
gentleman
,
"
we
be
both
oblige
to
you
;

you
may
be
perfectly
easy
;
for
I
give
you
my
word
<EOS>
I
be
very
well
satisfied
with
her
fortune

"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
answer
Jones
,
"
I
honour
you
every
moment
more
and
more
.
<EOS>
to
be
so
easily
satisfied
,
so
very
moderate
on
that
account
,
be
a
proof
of
the
soundness
of
your
understanding

well

the
nobleness
of
your
mind

<EOS>
"
not

very
moderate

young

not
so
very
moderate

answer
the
father
.
 
<EOS>
"
still
more
and
more
noble

"
reply
Jones
;
"
and
give
me
leave
to
add
,
sensible
:
for
sure
it
be
little
less
than
madness
to
consider
money
as
the
sole
foundation
of
happiness
.
<EOS>
such
a
woman
as
this
with
her
little

her
nothing

I
find

the
old

"
you
have
a
pretty
just
opinion

why

what

you

well

well

he
may
have
do
better

<EOS>
"
that
I
deny

one
of
the
good
of
woman

ay

in
point
of
fortune
I
mean

the

as
to
that
now

you

how

at

do
you

young

a
little
angry
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no

upon
my
soul

answer
Jones
,
"
I
be
in

<EOS>
nay

I
believe
I
have
go
to
the

farthing

if
I
do
the
lady
an
injury

I
ask
her
pardon

<EOS>
"
indeed
you
do

cry
the
father
;

I
be
certain
she
hath
fifty
time
that
sum
,

she

produce
fifty

"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"

Jones

"
it
be
too
late

My

with
surprize

I

you
be
unacquainted

he
again

to

Jones
;

no

sir
;
to
Miss
Nancy
Miller

the
daughter
of
Mrs

a
young
lady

be
you
banter

be
you
in

the
father
,
with
a
most
solemn
voice
.
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
sir

"
answer
Jones
,
"
I
scorn
the
character
of
a
banterer

<EOS>
I
come
to
you
in
most
serious
earnest

<EOS>
imagine
,
as
I
find
true
,
that
your
son
have
never
dare
acquaint
you
with
a
match
so
much
inferior
to
him
in
point
of
fortune
,
though
the
reputation
of
the
lady
will
suffer
it
no
longer
to
remain
a
secret
.
"
  
<EOS>
while
the
father
stand
like
one
strike
suddenly
dumb
at
this
news
,
a
gentleman
come
into
the
room
,
and
salute
him
by
the
name
of
brother
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
these
two
be
in
consanguinity
so
nearly
relate
,
they
be
in
their
disposition
almost
the
opposite
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
the
brother
who
now
arrive
have
likewise
be
breed
to
trade
,
in
which
he
no
sooner
see
himself
worth
L6000
than
he
purchase
a
small
estate
with
the
great
part
of
it
,
and
retire
into
the
country
;
where
he
marry
the
daughter
of
an
unbeneficed
clergyman
;
a
young
lady
,
who
,
though
she
have
neither
beauty
nor
fortune
,
have
recommend
herself
to
his
choice
entirely
by
her
good
humour
,
of
which
she
possess
a
very
large
share
.
  
<EOS>
with
this
woman
he
have
,
during
twenty
-
five
year
,
live
a
life
more
resemble
the
model
which
certain
poet
ascribe
to
the
golden
age
,
than
any
of
those
pattern
which
be
furnish
by
the
present
time
.
<EOS>
by
her
he
have
four
child
,
but
none
of
them
arrive
at
maturity
,
except
only
one
daughter
,
whom
,
in
vulgar
language
,
he
and
his
wife
have
spoil
;
that
is
,
have
educate
with
the
utmost
tenderness
and
fondness
,
which
she
return
to
such
a
degree
,
that
she
have
actually
refuse
a
very
extraordinary
match
with
a
gentleman
a
little
turn
of
forty
,
because
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
part
with
her
parent
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
lady
whom
Mr
Nightingale
have
intend
for
his
son
be
a
near
neighbour
of
his
brother
,
and
an
acquaintance
of
his
niece
;
and
in
reality
it
be
upon
the
account
of
his
project
match
that
he
be
now
come
to
town
;
not
,
indeed
,
to
forward
,
but
to
dissuade
his
brother
from
a
purpose
which
he
conceive
would
inevitably
ruin
his
nephew
;
for
he
foresee
no
other
event
from
a
union
with
Miss
Harris
,
notwithstanding
the
largeness
of
her
fortune
,
as
neither
her
person
nor
mind
seem
to
him
to
promise
any
kind
of
matrimonial
felicity
:
for
she
be
very
tall
,
very
thin
,
very
ugly
,
very
affected
,
very
silly
,
and
very
ill
-
natured

brother

therefore
,
no
sooner
mention
the
marriage
of
his
nephew
with
Miss
Miller
,
than
he
exprest
the
utmost
satisfaction
;
and
when
the
father
have
very
bitterly
revile
his
son
,
and
pronounce
sentence
of
beggary
upon
him
,
the
uncle
begin
in
the
follow
manner
:
  
"
if
you
be
a
little
cooler
,
brother
,
I
would
ask
you
whether
you
love
your
son
for
his
sake
or
for
your
own
.
<EOS>
You
would
answer
,
I
suppose
,
and
so
I
suppose
you
think
,
for
his
sake
;
and
doubtless
it
be
his
happiness
which
you
intend
in
the
marriage
you
propose
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
brother
,
to
prescribe
rule
of
happiness
to
other
hath
always
appear
to
me
very
absurd
,
and
to
insist
on
do
this
,
very
tyrannical
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
vulgar
error
,
I
know
;
but
it
be
,
nevertheless
,
an
error
.
<EOS>
and
if
this
be
absurd
in
other
thing
,
it
be
mostly
so
in
the
affair
of
marriage
,
the
happiness
of
which
depend
entirely
on
the
affection
which
subsist
between
the
party
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
therefore
always
think
it
unreasonable
in
parent
to
desire
to
chuse
for
their
child
on
this
occasion
;
since
to
force
affection
be
an
impossible
attempt
;
nay
,
so
much
doth
love
abhor
force
,
that
I
know
not
whether
,
through
an
unfortunate
but
uncurable
perverseness
in
our
nature
,
it
may
not
be
even
impatient
of
persuasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
,
however
,
true
that
,
though
a
parent
will
not
,
I
think
,
wisely
prescribe
,
he
ought
to
be
consult
on
this
occasion
;
and
,
in
strictness
,
perhaps
,
should
at
least
have
a
negative
voice
.
<EOS>
My
nephew
,
therefore
,
I
own
,
in
marrying
,
without
ask
your
advice
,
hath
be
guilty
of
a
fault
.
<EOS>
but
,
honestly
speak
,
brother
,
have
you
not
a
little
promote
this
fault
?
<EOS>
have
not
your
frequent
declaration
on
this
subject
give
him
a
moral
certainty
of
your
refusal
,
where
there
be
any
deficiency
in
point
of
fortune
?
<EOS>
nay
,
doth
not
your
present
anger
arise
solely
from
that
deficiency
?
<EOS>
and
if
he
hath
fail
in
his
duty
here
,
do
you
not
as
much
exceed
that
authority
when
you
absolutely
bargain
with
him
for
a
woman
,
without
his
knowledge
,
whom
you
yourself
never
see
,
and
whom
,
if
you
have
see
and
know
as
well
as
I
,
it
must
have
be
madness
in
you
to
have
ever
think
of
bring
her
into
your
family
?
  
<EOS>
"
still
I
own
my
nephew
in
a
fault
;
but
surely
it
be
not
an
unpardonable
fault
.
<EOS>
He
hath
act
indeed
without
your
consent
,
in
a
matter
in
which
he
ought
to
have
ask
it
,
but
it
be
in
a
matter
in
which
his
interest
be
principally
concerned
;
you
yourself
must
and
will
acknowledge
that
you
consult
his
interest
only
,
and
if
he
unfortunately
differ
from
you
,
and
hath
be
mistake
in
his
notion
of
happiness
,
will
you
,
brother
,
if
you
love
your
son
,
carry
him
still
wider
from
the
point
?
<EOS>
Will
you
increase
the
ill
consequence
of
his
simple
choice
?
<EOS>
Will
you
endeavour
to
make
an
event
certain
misery
to
him
,
which
may
accidentally
prove
so
?
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
brother
,
because
he
hath
put
it
out
of
your
power
to
make
his
circumstance
as
affluent
as
you
would
,
will
you
distress
them
as
much
as
you
can

which
to

improvident

I

irrecoverable

that
which
be
yet
to
do

<EOS>
let
your

have
fair
play

you
will
see
this

<EOS>
"
how

be
there
this

"
pugh

honour

disappoint

always

the
honour

your
company
home

reason

<EOS>
when
the
good
company
,
therefore
,
again
assemble
,
there
be
a
visible
alteration
in
all
their
face
;
and
the
good
-
humour
which
,
at
their
last
meeting
,
universally
shine
forth
in
every
countenance
,
be
now
change
into
a
much
less
agreeable
aspect
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
change
,
indeed
,
common
enough
to
the
weather
in
this
climate
,
from
sunshine
to
cloud
,
from
June
to
December
.
  
<EOS>
this
alteration
be
not
,
however
,
greatly
remark
by
any
present
;
for
as
they
be
all
now
endeavour
to
conceal
their
own
thought
,
and
to
act
a
part
,
they
become
all
too
busily
engage
in
the
scene
to
be
spectator
of
it
.
<EOS>
thus
neither
the
uncle
nor
nephew
see
any
symptom
of
suspicion
in
the
mother
or
daughter
;
nor
do
the
mother
or
daughter
remark
the
overact
complacence
of
the
old
man
,
nor
the
counterfeit
satisfaction
which
grin
in
the
feature
of
the
young
one
.
  
<EOS>
something
like
this
,
I
believe
,
frequently
happen
,
where
the
whole
attention
of
two
friend
be
engage
in
the
part
which
each
be
to
act
,
in
order
to
impose
on
the
other
,
neither
see
nor
suspect
the
art
practise
against
himself
;
and
thus
the
thrust
of
both
(
to
borrow
no
improper
metaphor
on
the
occasion
)
alike
take
place
.
  
<EOS>
from
the
same
reason
it
be
no
unusual
thing
for
both
party
to
be
overreach
in
a
bargain
,
though
the
one
must
be
always
the
great
loser
;
as
be
he
who
sell
a
blind
horse
,
and
receive
a
bad
note
in
payment
.
  
<EOS>
Our
company
in
about
half
an
hour
break
up
,
and
the
uncle
carry
off
his
nephew
;
but
not
before
the
latter
have
assure
Miss
Nancy
,
in
a
whisper
,
that
he
would
attend
her
early
in
the
morning
,
and
fulfil
all
his
engagement
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
,
who
be
the
least
concerned
in
this
scene
,
see
the
most
.
<EOS>
He
do
indeed
suspect
the
very
fact
;
for
,
besides
observe
the
great
alteration
in
the
behaviour
of
the
uncle
,
the
distance
he
assume
,
and
his
overstrained
civility
to
Miss
Nancy
;
the
carry
off
a
bridegroom
from
his
bride
at
that
time
of
night
be
so
extraordinary
a
proceeding
that
it
could
be
account
for
only
by
imagine
that
young
Nightingale
have
reveal
the
whole
truth
,
which
the
apparent
openness
of
his
temper
,
and
his
being
fluster
with
liquor
,
make
too
probable
.
  
<EOS>
while
he
be
reason
with
himself
,
whether
he
should
acquaint
these
poor
people
with
his
suspicion
,
the
maid
of
the
house
inform
him
that
a
gentlewoman
desire
to
speak
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
immediately
out
,
and
,
take
the
candle
from
the
maid
,
usher
his
visitant
upstair
,
who
,
in
the
person
of
Mrs
Honour
,
acquaint
him
with
such
dreadful
news
concern
his
Sophia
,
that
he
immediately
lose
all
consideration
for
every
other
person
;
and
his
whole
stock
of
compassion
be
entirely
swallow
up
in
reflection
on
his
own
misery
,
and
on
that
of
his
unfortunate
angel
.
  
<EOS>
what
this
dreadful
matter
be
,
the
reader
will
be
inform
,
after
we
have
first
relate
the
many
precede
step
which
produce
it
,
and
those
will
be
the
subject
of
the
follow
book
.
  
<EOS>
BOOK
XV
.
  
<EOS>
in
which
the
history
advance
about
two
day
.
    
<EOS>
too
short
to
need
a
preface
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
set
of
religious
,
or
rather
moral
writer
,
who
teach
that
virtue
<EOS>
be
the
certain
road
to
happiness
,
and
vice
to
misery
,
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
a
very
wholesome
and
comfortable
doctrine
,
and
to
which
we
have
but
one
objection
,
namely
,
that
it
be
not
true
.
  
<EOS>
indeed
,
if
by
virtue
these
writer
mean
the
exercise
of
those
cardinal
virtue
,
which
like
good
housewife
stay
at
home
,
and
mind
only
the
business
of
their
own
family
,
I
shall
very
readily
concede
the
point
;
for
so
surely
do
all
these
contribute
and
lead
to
happiness
,
that
I
could
almost
wish
,
in
violation
of
all
the
antient
and
modern
sage
,
to
call
them
rather
by
the
name
of
wisdom
,
than
by
that
of
virtue
;
for
,
with
regard
to
this
life
,
no
system
,
I
conceive
,
be
ever
wise
than
that
of
the
antient
Epicureans
,
who
hold
this
wisdom
to
constitute
the
chief
good
;
nor
foolisher
than
that
of
their
opposite
,
those
modern
epicure
,
who
place
all
felicity
in
the
abundant
gratification
of
every
sensual
appetite
.
  
<EOS>
but
if
by
virtue
be
mean
(
as
I
almost
think
it
ought
)
a
certain
relative
quality
,
which
be
always
busy
itself
without
-
door
,
and
seem
as
much
interested
in
pursue
the
good
of
other
as
its
own
;
I
can
not
so
easily
agree
that
this
be
the
sure
way
to
human
happiness
;
because
I
be
afraid
we
must
then
include
poverty
and
contempt
,
with
all
the
mischief
which
backbite
,
envy
,
and
ingratitude
,
can
bring
on
mankind
,
in
our
idea
of
happiness
;
nay
,
sometimes
perhaps
we
shall
be
oblige
to
wait
upon
the
say
happiness
to
a
jail
;
since
many
by
the
above
virtue
have
bring
themselves
thith
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
now
leisure
to
enter
upon
so
large
a
field
of
speculation
,
as
here
seem
open
upon
me
;
my
design
be
to
wipe
off
a
doctrine
that
lie
in
my
way
;
since
,
while
Mr
Jones
be
act
the
most
virtuous
part
imaginable
in
labour
to
preserve
his
fellow
-
creature
from
destruction
,
the
devil
,
or
some
other
evil
spirit
,
one
perhaps
cloathe
in
human
flesh
,
be
hard
at
work
to
make
him
completely
miserable
in
the
ruin
of
his
Sophia
.
  
<EOS>
this
therefore
would
seem
an
exception
to
the
above
rule
,
if
indeed
it
be
a
rule
;
but
as
we
have
in
our
voyage
through
life
see
so
many
other
exception
to
it
<EOS>
,
we
chuse
to
dispute
the
doctrine
on
which
it
be
found
,
which
we
do
not
apprehend
to
be
Christian
,
which
we
be
convinced
be
not
true
,
and
which
be
indeed
destructive
of
one
of
the
noble
argument
that
reason
alone
can
furnish
for
the
belief
of
immortality
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
the
reader
's
curiosity
(
if
he
hath
any
)
must
be
now
awake
,
and
hungry
,
we
shall
provide
to
feed
it
as
fast
as
we
can
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
be
open
a
very
black
design
against
Sophia
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
a
wise
old
gentleman
who
use
to
say
,
"
when
child
be
do
nothing
,
they
be
do
mischief
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
enlarge
this
quaint
say
to
the
most
beautiful
part
of
the
creation
in
general
;
but
so
far
I
may
be
allow
,
that
when
the
effect
of
female
jealousy
do
not
appear
openly
in
their
proper
colour
of
rage
and
fury
,
we
may
suspect
that
mischievous
passion
to
be
at
work
privately
,
and
attempt
to
undermine
,
what
it
doth
not
attack
above
-
ground
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
exemplify
in
the
conduct
of
Lady
Bellaston
,
who
,
under
all
the
smile
which
she
wear
in
her
countenance
,
conceal
much
indignation
against
Sophia
;
and
as
she
plainly
see
that
this
young
lady
stand
between
her
and
the
full
indulgence
of
her
desire
,
she
resolve
to
get
rid
of
her
by
some
mean
or
other
;
nor
be
it
long
before
a
very
favourable
opportunity
of
accomplish
this
present
itself
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
may
be
pleased
to
remember
,
that
when
Sophia
be
throw
into
that
consternation
at
the
playhouse
,
by
the
wit
and
humour
of
a
set
of
young
gentleman
who
call
themselves
the
town
,
we
inform
him
,
that
she
have
put
herself
under
the
protection
of
a
young
nobleman
,
who
have
very
safely
conduct
her
to
her
chair
.
  
<EOS>
this
nobleman
,
who
frequently
visit
Lady
Bellaston
,
have
more
than
once
see
Sophia
there
,
since
her
arrival
in
town
,
and
have
conceive
a
very
great
like
to
her
;
which
like
,
as
beauty
never
look
more
amiable
than
in
distress
,
Sophia
have
in
this
fright
so
encreased
,
that
he
may
now
,
without
any
great
impropriety
,
be
say
to
be
actually
in
love
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
easily
be
believe
,
that
he
would
not
suffer
so
handsome
an
occasion
of
improve
his
acquaintance
with
the
beloved
object
as
now
offer
itself
to
elapse
,
when
even
good
breeding
alone
may
have
prompt
him
to
pay
her
a
visit
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
therefore
,
after
this
accident
,
he
wait
on
Sophia
,
with
the
usual
compliment
,
and
hope
that
she
have
receive
no
harm
from
her
last
night
's
adventure
.
  
<EOS>
as
love
,
like
fire
,
when
once
thoroughly
kindle
,
be
soon
blow
into
a
flame
,
Sophia
in
a
very
short
time
compleate
her
conquest
.
<EOS>
Time
now
fly
away
unperceived
,
and
the
noble
lord
have
be
two
hour
in
company
with
the
lady
,
before
it
enter
into
his
head
that
he
have
make
too
long
a
visit
.
<EOS>
though
this
circumstance
alone
would
have
alarm
Sophia
,
who
be
somewhat
more
a
mistress
of
computation
at
present
;
she
have
indeed
much
more
pregnant
evidence
from
the
eye
of
her
lover
of
what
past
within
his
bosom
;
<EOS>
nay
,
though
he
do
not
make
any
open
declaration
of
his
passion
,
yet
many
of
his
expression
be
rather
too
warm
,
and
too
tender
,
to
have
be
impute
to
complacence
,
even
in
the
age
when
such
complacence
be
in
fashion
;
the
very
reverse
of
which
be
well
known
to
be
the
reign
mode
at
present
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Bellaston
have
be
apprize
of
his
lordship
's
visit
at
his
first
arrival
;
and
the
length
of
it
very
well
satisfy
her
,
that
thing
go
as
she
wish
,
and
as
indeed
she
have
suspect
the
second
time
she
see
this
young
couple
together
.
<EOS>
this
business
,
she
rightly
I
think
conclude
,
that
she
should
by
no
means
forward
by
mix
in
the
company
while
they
be
together
;
she
therefore
order
her
servant
,
that
when
my
lord
be
go
,
they
should
tell
him
she
desire
to
speak
with
him
;
and
employ
the
intermediate
time
in
meditate
how
best
to
accomplish
a
scheme
,
which
she
make
no
doubt
but
his
lordship
would
very
readily
embrace
the
execution
of
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fellamar
(
for
that
be
the
title
of
this
young
nobleman
)
be
no
sooner
introduce
to
her
ladyship
,
than
she
attack
him
in
the
following
strain
:
"
bless
me
,
<EOS>
my
lord
,
be
you
here
yet
?
<EOS>
I
think
my
servant
have
make
a
mistake
,
and
let
you
go
away
;
and
I
want
to
see
you
about
an
affair
of
some
importance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
Lady
Bellaston
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
do
not
wonder
you
be
astonish
at
the
length
of
my
visit
;
for
I
have
staid
above
two
hour
,
and
I
do
not
think
I
have
staid
above
half
-
a
-
one
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
I
to
conclude
from
thence
,
my
lord
?
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
company
must
be
very
agreeable
which
can
make
time
slide
away
so
very
deceitfully
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
upon
my
honour
,
"
say
he
,
"
the
most
agreeable
I
ever
see
.
<EOS>
pray
tell
me
,
Lady
Bellaston
,
who
be
this
blaze
star
which
you
have
produce
among
us
all
of
a
sudden
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
blaze
star
,
my
lord
?
<EOS>
"
say
she
,
affect
a
surprize
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
"
say
he
,
"
the
lady
I
see
here
the
other
day
,
whom
I
have
last
night
in
my
arm
at
the
playhouse
,
and
to
whom
I
have
be
make
that
unreasonable
visit

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
o

my
cousin
Western
!

say
she
;
"
why

that
blaze
star
,
my

be
the
daughter
of
a

booby
squire

about
a
fortnight

for
the
first

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
upon
my
soul

"
say
he
,
"
I
should
swear
she
have
be
breed
up
in
a
court

for
besides
her
beauty

I
never

anything
so
genteel

so

so
polite

upon

"
I

<EOS>
"
Nay

my

"
say
she

"
it
be
not

then
I
can

I

indeed

I

there
be

this

there
may

it

I
be
so
far
from

I

I
must
place

have
an
opportunity

more

have
no

they
will
all
go
soon

I
shall
be
at
home

nobody

<EOS>
then
your
lordship
may
be
a
little
more
explicit
.
<EOS>
nay
,
I
will
contrive
some
method
to
convince
you
of
her
attachment
to
this
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
My
lord
make
proper
compliment
,
accept
the
invitation
,
and
then
they
part
to
dress
,
it
be
now
past
three
in
the
morning
,
or
to
reckon
by
the
old
style
,
in
the
afternoon
.
    
<EOS>
a
further
explanation
of
the
foregoing
design
.
 
<EOS>
though
the
reader
may
have
long
since
conclude
Lady
Bellaston
to
be
a
member
(
and
no
inconsiderable
one
)
of
the
great
world
;
she
be
in
reality
a
very
considerable
member
of
the
little
world
;
by
which
appellation
be
distinguish
a
very
worthy
and
honourable
society
which
not
long
since
flourish
in
this
kingdom
.
  
<EOS>
among
other
good
principle
upon
which
this
society
be
found
,
there
be
one
very
remarkable
;
for
,
as
it
be
a
rule
of
an
honourable
club
of
hero
,
who
assemble
at
the
close
of
the
late
war
,
that
all
the
member
should
every
day
fight
once
at
least
;
so
'
twas
in
this
,
that
every
member
should
,
within
the
twenty
-
four
hour
,
tell
at
least
one
merry
fib
,
which
be
to
be
propagate
by
all
the
brother
and
sisterhood
.
  
<EOS>
many
idle
story
be
tell
about
this
society
,
which
from
a
certain
quality
may
be
,
perhaps
not
unjustly
,
suppose
to
have
come
from
the
society
themselves
.
<EOS>
as
,
that
the
devil
be
the
president
;
and
that
he
sit
in
person
in
an
elbow
-
chair
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
;
but
,
upon
very
strict
enquiry
,
I
find
there
be
not
the
least
truth
in
any
of
those
tale
,
and
that
the
assembly
consist
in
reality
of
a
set
of
very
good
sort
of
people
,
and
the
fibs
which
they
propagate
be
of
a
harmless
kind
,
and
tend
only
to
produce
mirth
and
good
humour
.
  
<EOS>
Edwards
be
likewise
a
member
of
this
comical
society
.
<EOS>
to
him
therefore
Lady
Bellaston
apply
as
a
proper
instrument
for
her
purpose
,
and
furnish
him
with
a
fib
,
which
he
be
to
vent
whenever
the
lady
give
him
her
cue
;
and
this
be
not
to
be
till
the
evening
,
when
all
the
company
but
Lord
Fellamar
and
himself
be
go
,
and
while
they
be
engage
in
a
rubber
at
whist
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
time
then
,
which
be
between
seven
and
eight
in
the
evening
,
we
will
convey
our
reader
;
when
Lady
Bellaston
,
Lord
Fellamar
,
Miss
Western
,
and
Tom
,
be
engage
at
whist
,
and
in
the
last
game
of
their
rubber
,
Tom
receive
his
cue
from
Lady
Bellaston
,
which
be
,
"
I
protest
,
Tom
,
you
be
grow
intolerable
lately
;
you
use
to
tell
us
all
the
news
of
the
town
,
and
now
you
know
no
more
of
the
world
than
if
you
live
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Edwards
then
begin
as
follow
:
"
the
fault
be
not
mine
,
madam
:
<EOS>
it
lie
in
the
dulness
of
the
age
,
that
doth
nothing
worth
talk
of
.
 
<EOS>
o
la
!
<EOS>
though
now
I

on't
there
hath
a
terrible
accident
befall
poor
Colonel
Wilcox

<EOS>
Poor
Ned

<EOS>
You
know
him

my
lord

faith

<EOS>
I
be
very
much
concerned

him

<EOS>
"
what
be
it
,
pray
?
"
say
Lady
Bellaston
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
he
hath
kill
a
man
this
morning

a
duel

that
be
all

"
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
,
who
be
not
in
the
secret

ask
gravely
,
whom
he
have
kill
?
<EOS>
to
which
Edwards
answer
,
"
a
young
fellow
we
none
of
us
know
;
a
Somersetshire
lad

come
to
town

one
Jones

name

;
a
near
relation
of
one
Mr
Allworthy
,
of
whom
your
lordship
<EOS>
I
believe
hath
hear
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
lad
lie
dead
in
a
coffee
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
upon
my
soul
,
he
be
one
of
the
fine
corpse
I
ever
see
in
my
life

<EOS>
Sophia
,
who
have
just
begin
to
deal
as
Tom
have
mention
that
a
man
be
kill
,
stopt
her
hand
,
and
listen
with
attention
(
for
all
story
of
that
kind

her
)
,
but
no
sooner
have
he
arrive
at
the
latter
part
of
the
story

she
begin
to
deal
again
;

have
deal
three
card
to
one

seven
to
another

and
ten
to
a
third
,
at
last
dropt
the
rest
from
her
hand

and
fall
back
in
her
chair

company
behave
as
usually

these
occasion

the
usual
disturbance

,
the
usual
assistance
be
summon
,
and
Sophia
at
last
,
as
it
be
usual
,
return
again
to
life
,
and
be
soon
after
,
at
her
earnest
desire

lead
to
her
own
apartment
;
where
,
at
my
lord
's
request
,
Lady
Bellaston
acquaint
her
with
the
truth
,
attempt
to
carry
it
off
as
a
jest
of
her
own
,
and
comfort
her
with
repeat
assurance
,
that
neither
his
lordship
nor
Tom
,
though
she
have
teach
him
the
story
,
be
in
the
true
secret
of
the
affair
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
farther
evidence
necessary
to
convince
Lord
Fellamar
how
justly
the
case
have
be
represent
to
him
by
Lady
Bellaston
;
and
now
,
at
her
return
into
the
room
,
a
scheme
be
lay
between
these
two
noble
person
,
which
,
though
it
appear
in
no
very
heinous
light
to
his
lordship
(
as
he
faithfully
promise
,
and
faithfully
resolve
too
,
to
make
the
lady
all
the
subsequent
amend
in
his
power
by
marriage
)
,
yet
many
of
our
reader
,
we
doubt
not
,
will
see
with
just
detestation
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
evening
at
seven
be
appoint
for
the
fatal
purpose
,
when
Lady
Bellaston
undertake
that
Sophia
should
be
alone
,
and
his
lordship
should
be
introduce
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
whole
family
be
to
be
regulate
for
the
purpose
,
most
of
the
servant
despatch
out
of
the
house
;
and
for
Mrs
Honour
,
who
,
to
prevent
suspicion
,
be
to
be
leave
with
her
mistress
till
his
lordship
's
arrival
,
Lady
Bellaston
herself
be
to
engage
her
in
an
apartment
as
distant
as
possible
from
the
scene
of
the
intend
mischief
,
and
out
of
the
hearing
of
Sophia
.
  
<EOS>
matter
be
thus
agree
on
,
his
lordship
take
his
leave
,
and
her
ladyship
retire
to
rest
,
highly
pleased
with
a
project
,
of
which
she
have
no
reason
to
doubt
the
success
,
and
which
promise
so
effectually
to
remove
Sophia
from
be
any
further
obstruction
to
her
amour
with
Jones
,
by
a
means
of
which
she
should
never
appear
to
be
guilty
,
even
if
the
fact
appear
to
the
world
;
but
this
she
make
no
doubt
of
prevent
by
huddle
up
a
marriage
,
to
which
she
think
the
ravished
Sophia
would
easily
be
bring
to
consent
,
and
at
which
all
the
rest
of
her
family
would
rejoice
.
  
<EOS>
but
affair
be
not
in
so
quiet
a
situation
in
the
bosom
of
the
other
conspirator

his
mind
be
tost
in
all
the
distract
anxiety
so
nobly
describe
by
Shakespear

between
the
acting
of
a
dreadful
thing

and
the
first
motion
,
all
the
interim
be
      
like
a
phantasma
,
or
a
hideous
dream

<EOS>
the
genius
and
the
mortal
instrument
      
be
then
in
council
;
and
the
state
of
man
,
      
<EOS>
like
to
a
little
kingdom
,
suffer
then
      
the
nature
of
an
insurrection
.
"
    
<EOS>
though
the
violence
of
his
passion
have
make
him
eagerly
embrace
the
first
hint
of
this
design
,
especially
as
it
come
from
a
relation
of
the
lady
,
yet
when
that
friend
to
reflection
,
a
pillow
,
have
place
the
action
itself
in
all
its
natural
black
colour
before
his
eye
,
with
all
the
consequence
which
must
,
and
those
which
may
probably
attend
it
,
his
resolution
begin
to
abate
,
or
rather
indeed
to
go
over
to
the
other
side
;
and
after
a
long
conflict
,
which
last
a
whole
night
,
between
honour
and
appetite
,
the
former
at
length
prevail
,
and
he
determine
to
wait
on
Lady
Bellaston
,
and
to
relinquish
the
design
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Bellaston
be
in
bed
,
though
very
late
in
the
morning
,
and
Sophia
sit
by
her
bed
-
side
,
when
the
servant
acquaint
her
that
Lord
Fellamar
be
below
in
the
parlour
;
upon
which
her
ladyship
desire
him
to
stay
,
and
that
she
would
see
him
presently
;
but
the
servant
be
no
sooner
depart
than
poor
Sophia
begin
to
intreat
her
cousin
not
to
encourage
the
visit
of
that
odious
lord
(
so
she
call
him
,
though
a
little
unjustly
)
upon
her
account
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
his
design
,
"
say
she
;
"
for
he
make
downright
love
to
me
yesterday
morning

as
I
be
resolve
never
to
admit
it

I

La

Lady
Bellaston

"
you
country

nothing

you
fancy
every

love

<EOS>
He
be
one
of
the
most
gallant
young
fellow
about
town

I
be
convinced
mean
no
more
than
a
little
gallantry
.
<EOS>
make
love
to
you

<EOS>
I
wish
with
all
my

he
would

you
must
be
an
arrant
mad
woman
to
refuse
him

I

certainly
be

upon

"
  
<EOS>
"
o
child
!
"
say
Lady
Bellaston
,
"
you
need
not
be
so
fearful

if
you
resolve

run
away
with

I
know
no

you

upon

<EOS>
I
will
never

away

I
ever
marry
contrary
to
my
father
's
inclination

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Miss
Western
,
"
say
the
lady
,
"
if
you
be
not
in
a
humour
to
see
company
this
morning
,
you
may
retire
to
your

apartment
;
for
I
be
not
frightened
at
his
lordship
,

must
send
for
him
up
into
my
dressing
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sophia
thank
her
ladyship
,
and
withdraw
;
and
presently
afterwards
Fellamar
be
admit
upstairs
.
    
<EOS>
by
which
it
will
appear
how
dangerous
an
advocate
a
lady
be
when
she
apply
her
eloquence
to
an
ill
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
when
Lady
Bellaston
hear
the
young
lord
's
scruple
,
she
treat
them
with
the
same
disdain
with
which
one
of
those
sage
of
the
law
,
call
Newgate
solicitor
,
treat
the
qualm
of
conscience
in
a
young
witness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
lord
,
"
say
she
,
"
you
certainly
want
a
cordial
.
<EOS>
I
must
send
to
Lady
edgely
for
one
of
her
good
dram
.
<EOS>
fie
upon
it
!
<EOS>
have
more
resolution
.
<EOS>
be
you
frightened
by
the
word
rape
?
<EOS>
or
be
you
apprehensive
 
?
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
if
the
story
of
Helen
be
modern
,
I
should
think
it
unnatural
.
<EOS>
I
mean
the
behaviour
of
Paris
,
not
the
fondness
of
the
lady
;
for
all
woman
love
a
man
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
there
be
another
story
of
the
Sabine
lady
 
and
that
too
,
I
thank
heaven
,
be
very
antient
.
<EOS>
Your
lordship
,
perhaps
,
will
admire
my
reading
;
but
I
think
Mr
Hook
tell
us
,
they
make
tolerable
good
wife
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
few
of
my
married
acquaintance
be
ravish
by
their
husband
.
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
dear
Lady
Bellaston
,
"
cry
he
,
"
do
not
ridicule
me
in
this
manner
.
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
my
good
lord
,
"
answer
she
,
"
do
you
think
any
woman
in
England
would
not
laugh
at
you
in
her
heart
,
whatever
prudery
she
may
wear
in
her
countenance
?
 
<EOS>
You
force
me
to
use
a
strange
kind
of
language
,
and
to
betray
my
sex
most
abominably
;
but
I
be
content
with
know
my
intention
be
good
,
and
that
I
be
endeavour
to
serve
my
cousin
;
for
I
think
you
will
make
her
a
husband
notwithstanding
this
;
or
,
upon
my
soul
,
I
would
not
even
persuade
her
to
fle
herself
away
upon
an
empty
title
.
<EOS>
She
should
not
upbraid
me
hereafter
with
have
lose
a
man
of
spirit
;
for
that
his
enemy
allow
this
poor
young
fellow
to
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
let
those
who
have
have
the
satisfaction
of
hear
reflection
of
this
kind
from
a
wife
or
a
mistress
,
declare
whether
they
be
at
all
sweeten
by
come
from
a
female
tongue
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
they
sunk
deeper
into
his
lordship
than
anything
which
demosthene
or
Cicero
could
have
say
on
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Bellaston
,
perceive
she
have
fire
the
young
lord
's
pride
,
begin
now
,
like
a
true
orator
,
to
rouse
other
passion
to
its
assistance
.
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
say
she
,
in
a
graver
voice
,
"
you
will
be
pleased
to
remember
,
you
mention
this
matter
to
me
first
;
for
I
would
not
appear
to
you
in
the
light
of
one
who
be
endeavour

put
off
my
cousin
upon
you

<EOS>
fourscore
thousand
pound
do
not
stand
in
need
of
an
advocate
to
recommend
them
.
"
<EOS>
"
nor
doth
Miss
Western
,
"
say
he
,
"
require
any
recommendation
from
her
fortune
;
for
,
in
my
opinion
,
no
woman
ever
have
half
her
charm
.
"
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
my
lord
,
"
reply
the
lady
,
look
in
the
glass
,
"
there
have
be
woman
with
more
than
half
her
charm
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
;
not
that
I
need
lessen
her
on
that
account
:
she
be
a
most
delicious
girl
<EOS>
,
that
be
certain
;
and
within
these
few
hour
she
will
be
in
the
arm
of
one
,
who
surely
doth
not
deserve
her
,
though
I
will
give
him
his
due
,
I
believe
he
be
truly
a
man
of
spirit

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
madam
,
"
say
my
lord
;
"
<EOS>
though
I
must
own
he
doth
not
deserve
her
;
for
,
unless
heaven
or
your
ladyship
disappoint
me
,
she
shall
within
that
time
be
in
mine

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
spoken
,
my
lord
,
"
answer
the
lady
;
"
I
promise
you
no
disappointment
shall
happen
from
my
side
;
and
within
this
week
I
be
convinced
I
shall
call
your
lordship
my
cousin
in
public
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
remainder
of
this
scene
consist
entirely
of
rapture
,
excuse
,
and
compliment
,
very
pleasant
to
have
hear
from
the
party
;
but
rather
dull
when
relate
at
second
hand
.
<EOS>
here
,
therefore
,
we
shall
put
an
end
to
this
dialogue
,
and
hasten
to
the
fatal
hour
when
everything
be
prepare
for
the
destruction
of
poor
Sophia
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
be
the
most
tragical
matter
in
our
whole
history
,
we
shall
treat
it
in
a
chapter
by
itself
.
    
<EOS>
contain
some
matter
which
may
affect
,
and
other
which
may
surprize
,
the
reader
.
 
<EOS>
the
clock
have
now
strike
seven
,
and
poor
Sophia
,
alone
and
melancholy
,
sit
read
a
tragedy
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
Fatal
Marriage
;
and
she
be
now
come
to
that
part
where
the
poor
distrest
Isabella
dispose
of
her
wedding
-
ring
.
  
<EOS>
here
the
book
dropt
from
her
hand
,
and
a
shower
of
tear
run
down
into
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
in
this
situation
she
have
continue
a
minute
,
when
the
door
open
,
and
in
come
Lord
Fellamar
.
<EOS>
Sophia
start
from
her
chair
at
his
entrance
;
and
his
lordship
advance
forwards
,
and
make
a
low
bow
,
say
,
"
I
be
afraid
,
Miss
Western
,
I
break
in
upon
you
abruptly
.
"
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
my
lord
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
must
own
myself
a
little
surprized
at
this
unexpected
visit
.
"
<EOS>
"
if
this
visit
be
unexpected
,
madam
,
"
answer
Lord
Fellamar
,
"
my
eye
must
have
be
very
faithless
interpreter
of
my
heart
,
when
last
I
have
the
honour
of
see
you
;
for
surely
you
could
not
otherwise
have
hope
to
detain
my
heart
in
your
possession
,
without
receive
a
visit
from
its
owner
.
<EOS>
"
Sophia
,
confuse
as
she
be
,
answer
this
bombast
(
and
very
properly
I
think
)
with
a
look
of
inconceivable
disdain
.
<EOS>
My
lord
then
make
another
and
a
long
speech
of
the
same
sort
.
<EOS>
upon
which
Sophia
,
tremble
,
say
,
"
be
I
really
to
conceive
your
lordship
to
be
out
of
your
sense
?
<EOS>
sure
,
my
lord
,
there
be
no
other
excuse
for
such
behaviour
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
be
,
indeed
,
madam
,
in
the
situation
you
suppose
,
"
cry
his
lordship
;
"
and
sure
you
will
pardon
the
effect
of
a
frenzy
which
you
yourself
have
occasion
;
for
love
hath
so
totally
deprive
me
of
reason
,
that
I
be
scarce
accountable
for
any
of
my
action
.
"
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
my
lord
,
"
say
Sophia
,
"
I
neither
understand
your
word
nor
your
behaviour
.
"
<EOS>
"
suffer
me
then
,
madam
,
"
cry
he
,
"
at
your
foot
to
explain
both
,
by
lay
open
my
soul
to
you
,
and
declare
that
I
doat
on
you
to
the
high
degree
of
distraction
.
<EOS>
o
most
adorable
,
most
divine
creature
!
<EOS>
what
language
can
express
the
sentiment
of
my
heart
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
assure
you
,
my
lord
,
"
say
Sophia
,
"
I
shall
not
stay
to
hear
any
more
of
this
.
"
<EOS>
"
do
not
,
"
cry
he
,
"
think
of
leave
me
thus
cruelly
;
could
you
know
half
the
torment
which
I
feel
,
that
tender
bosom
must
pity
what
those
eye
have
cause
.
<EOS>
"
then
fetch
a
deep
sigh
,
and
lay
hold
of
her
hand
,
he
run
on
for
some
minute
in
a
strain
which
would
be
little
more
pleasing
to
the
reader
than
it
be
to
the
lady
;
and
at
last
conclude
with
a
declaration
,
"
that
if
he
be
master
of
the
world
,
he
would
lay
it
at
her
foot
.
"
<EOS>
Sophia
then
,
forcibly
pull
away
her
hand
from
his
,
answer
with
much
spirit
,
"
I
promise
you
,
sir
,
your
world
and
its
master
I
should
spurn
from
me
with
equal
contempt
.
"
<EOS>
She
then
offer
to
go
;
and
Lord
Fellamar
,
again
lay
hold
of
her
hand
,
say
,
"
pardon
me
,
my
beloved
angel
,
freedom
which
nothing
but
despair
could
have
tempt
me
to
take
.
 
<EOS>
believe
me
,
could
I
have
have
any
hope
that
my
title
and
fortune
,
neither
of
them
inconsiderable
,
unless
when
compare
with
your
worth
,
would
have
be
accept
,
I
have
,
in
the
humblest
manner
,
present
them
to
your
acceptance
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
lose
you
.
 
<EOS>
by
heaven
,
I
will
sooner
part
with
my
soul
!
 
<EOS>
You
be
,
<EOS>
you
must
,
you
shall
be
only
mine
.
"
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
intreat
you
to
desist
from
a
vain
pursuit
;
for
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
will
never
hear
you
on
this
subject
.
<EOS>
let
go
my
hand
,
my
lord
;
for
I
be
resolve
to
go
from
you
this
moment
;
nor
will
I
ever
see
you
more
.
"
<EOS>
"
then
,
madam
,
"
cry
his
lordship
,
"
I
must
make
the
good
use
of
this
moment
;
for
I
can
not
live
,
nor
will
I
live
without
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
,
my
lord
?
"
say
Sophia
;
"
I
will
raise
the
family
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
fear
,
madam
,
"
answer
he
,
"
but
of
lose
you
,
and
that
I
be
resolve
to
prevent
,
the
only
way
which
despair
point
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
catch
her
in
his
arm
:
upon
which
she
scream
so
loud
,
that
she
must
have
alarm
some
one
to
her
assistance
,
have
not
Lady
Bellaston
take
care
to
remove
all
ear
.
  
<EOS>
but
a
more
lucky
circumstance
happen
for
poor
Sophia
;
another
noise
now
break
forth
,
which
almost
drown
her
cry
;
for
now
the
whole
house
ring
with
,
"
where
be
she
?
<EOS>
d####n
<EOS>
me
,
I
will
unkennel
her
this
instant
.
<EOS>
show
me
her
chamber
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
where
be
my
daughter
?
<EOS>
I
know
she
be
in
the
house
,
and
I
will
see
her
if
she
be
above
-
ground
.
<EOS>
show
me
where
she
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
which
last
word
the
door
fly
open
,
and
in
come
Squire
Western
,
with
his
parson
and
a
set
of
myrmidon
at
his
heel
.
  
<EOS>
how
miserable
must
have
be
the
condition
of
poor
Sophia
,
when
the
enraged
voice
of
her
father
be
welcome
to
her
ear
!
<EOS>
welcome
indeed
<EOS>
it
be
,
and
luckily
do
he
come
;
for
it
be
the
only
accident
upon
earth
which
could
have
preserve
the
peace
of
her
mind
from
be
for
ever
destroy
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
,
notwithstanding
her
fright
,
presently
know
her
father
's
voice
;
and
his
lordship
,
notwithstanding
his
passion
,
know
the
voice
of
reason
,
which
peremptorily
assure
him
,
it
be
not
now
a
time
for
the
perpetration
of
his
villany
.
<EOS>
hearing
,
therefore
,
the
voice
approach
,
and
hear
<EOS>
likewise
whose
it
be
(
for
as
the
squire
more
than
once
roar
forth
the
word
daughter
,
so
Sophia
,
in
the
midst
of
her
struggling
,
cry
out
upon
her
father
)
,
he
think
proper
to
relinquish
his
prey
,
have
only
disorder
her
handkerchief
,
and
with
his
rude
lip
commit
violence
on
her
lovely
neck
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
reader
's
imagination
doth
not
assist
me
,
I
shall
never
be
able
to
describe
the
situation
of
these
two
person
when
Western
come
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
Sophia
totter
into
a
chair
,
where
she
sit
disordered
,
pale
,
breathless
,
burst
with
indignation
at
Lord
Fellamar
;
affright
,
and
yet
more
rejoice
,
at
the
arrival
of
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
sit
down
near
her
,
with
the
bag
of
his
wig
hang
over
one
of
his
shoulder
,
the
rest
of
his
dress
be
somewhat
disorder
,
and
rather
a
great
proportion
of
linen
than
be
usual
appear
at
his
bosom
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
rest
,
he
be
amazed
,
affright
,
vexed
,
and
ashamed
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
Squire
Western
,
he
happen
at
this
time
to
be
overtake
by
an
enemy
,
which
very
frequently
pursue
,
and
seldom
fail
to
overtake
,
most
of
the
country
gentleman
in
this
kingdom
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
literally
speak
,
drunk
;
<EOS>
which
circumstance
,
together
with
his
natural
impetuosity

<EOS>
the
strength
of
the

at
first

of
more

My

He

may

easily
have

off
his

that
good

desire

in

she
be
not

little
pleased

the
confinement

fail

though
the
reader
,
in
many
history
,
be
oblige
to
digest
much
more
unaccountable
appearance
than
this
of
Mr
Western
,
without
any
satisfaction
at
all
;
yet
,
as
we
dearly
love
to
oblige
him
whenever
it
be
in
our
power

we
shall
now
proceed
to
shew
by
what
method
<EOS>
the

discover
where
his
daughter
be

<EOS>
in
the
third
chapter
,
then
,
of
the
precede
book
,
we
give
a
hint
(
for
it
be
not
our
custom
to
unfold
at
any
time
more
than
be
necessary
for
the
occasion
)
<EOS>
that
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
who
be
very
desirous
of
reconcile
her
uncle
and
aunt
Western
,
think
she
have
a
probable
opportunity
,
by
the
service
of
preserve
Sophia
from
commit
the
same
crime
which
have
draw
on
herself
the
anger
of
her
family
.
<EOS>
after
much
deliberation
,
therefore
,
she
resolve
to
inform
her
aunt
Western
where
her
cousin
be
,
and
accordingly
she
writ
the
follow
letter
,
which
we
shall
give
the
reader
at
length
,
for
more
reason
than
one
.
    
<EOS>
"
HONOURED
MADAM
,
    
<EOS>
"
the
occasion
of
my
writing
this
will
perhaps
make
a
letter
of
mine
  
agreeable
to
my
dear
aunt
,
for
the
sake
of
one
of
her
niece
,
though
  
I
have
little
reason
to
hope
it
will
be
so
on
the
account
of
  
another
.
    
<EOS>
"
without
more
apology
,
as
I
be
come
to
throw
my
unhappy
self
at
  
your
foot
,
I
meet
,
by
the
strange
accident
in
the
world
,
my
cousin
  
Sophy
,
whose
history
you
be
better
acquaint
with
than
myself
,
  
though
,
alas
!
<EOS>
I
know
infinitely
too
much
;
enough
indeed
to
satisfy
  
me
,
that
unless
she
be
immediately
prevent
,
she
be
in
danger
of
  
run
into
the
same
fatal
mischief
,
which
,
by
foolishly
and
  
ignorantly
refuse
your
most
wise
and
prudent
advice
,
I
have
  
unfortunately
bring
on
myself
.
    
<EOS>

in
short
,
I
have
see
the
man
,
nay
,
I
be
most
part
of
yesterday
in
  
his
company
,
and
a
charming
young
fellow
I
promise
you
he
be

<EOS>
by
  
what
accident
he
come
acquaint
with
me
be
too
tedious
to
tell
you
  
now
;
but
I
have
this
morning
change
my
lodging
to
avoid
him
,

<EOS>
he
should
by
my
mean
discover
my
cousin
;
for
he
doth
not
yet
know
  
where
she
be
,
and
it
be
adviseable
he
should
not
,
till
my
uncle
hath
  
secure
her
.
 
<EOS>
no
time
therefore
be
to
be
lose
;
and
I
need
only
  
inform
you
,
that
she
be
now
with
Lady
Bellaston

whom
I
have
see

and
who
hath

I
find

a
design

conceal
her
from

should
ever
have
my
lady
,
as
to
be
sure
I
now
hope
heartily
you
will
;
for
you
be
a
generous
,
good
-
natured
gentleman
;
and
I
be
sure
you
love
her
,
and
to
be
sure
she
love
you
as
dearly
as
her
own
soul
;
it
be
a
matter
in
vain
to
deny
it
;
because
as
why
,
everybody
,
that
be
in
the
least
acquainted
with
my
lady
,
must
see
it
;
for
,
poor
dear
lady
,
she
can
not
dissemble
:
and
if
two
people
who
love
one
another
a'n't
happy
,
why
who
should
be
so
?
<EOS>
happiness
do
not
always
depend
upon
what
people
have
;
besides
,
my
lady
have
enough
for
both
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
therefore
,
as
one
may
say
,
it
would
be
all
the
pity
in
the
world
to
keep
two
such
lovier
asunder
;
nay
,
I
be
convince
,
for
my
part
,
you
will
meet
together
at
last
;
for
,
if
it
be
to
be
,
there
be
no
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
if
a
marriage
be
make
in
heaven
,
all
the
justice
of
peace
upon
earth
can
not
break
it
off
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
I
wish
that
parson
Supple
have
but
a
little
more
spirit
,
to
tell
the
squire
of
his
wickedness
in
endeavour
to
force
his
daughter
contrary
to
her
liking
;
but
then
his
whole
dependance
be
on
the
squire
;
and
so
the
poor
gentleman
,
though
he
be
a
very
religious
good
sort
of
man
,
and
talk
of
the
badness
of
such
doing
behind
the
squire
be
back
,
yet
he
dare
not
say
his
soul
be
his
own
to
his
face
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
I
never
see
him
make
so
bold
as
just
now
;
I
be
afeard
the
squire
would
have
strike
him
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
your
honour
be
melancholy
,
sir
,
nor
despair
;
thing
may
go
better
,
as
long
as
you
be
sure
of
my
lady
,
and
that
I
be
certain
you
may
be
;
for
she
never
will
be
bring
to
consent
to
marry
any
other
man
.
<EOS>
indeed
I
be
terribly
afeare
the
squire
will
do
her
a
mischief
in
his
passion
,
for
he
be
a
prodigious
passionate
gentleman
;
and
I
be
afeare
too
the
poor
lady
will
be
bring
to
break
her
heart
,
for
she
be
as
tender
-
hearted
as
a
chicken
.
<EOS>
It
be
pity
,
methink
,
she
have
not
a
little
of
my
courage
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
in
love
with
a
young
man
,
and
my
father
offer
to
lock
me
up
,
I
would
tear
his
eye
out
<EOS>
but
I
would
come
at
him
;
but
then
there
be
a
great
fortune
in
the
case
,
which
it
be
in
her
father
's
power
either
to
give
her
or
not
;
that
,
to
be
sure
,
may
make
some
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
whether
Jones
give
strict
attention
to
all
the
foregoing
harangue
,
or
whether
it
be
for
want
of
any
vacancy
in
the
discourse
,
I
can
not
determine
;
but
he
never
once
attempt
to
answer
,
nor
do
she
once
stop
till
Partridge
come
run
into
the
room
,
and
inform
him
that
the
great
lady
be
upon
the
stair
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
could
equal
the
dilemma
to
which
Jones
be
now
reduce
.
<EOS>
honour
know
nothing
of
any
acquaintance
that
subsist
between
him
and
Lady
Bellaston
,
and
she
be
almost
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
whom
he
would
have
communicate
it
.
<EOS>
in
this
hurry
and
distress
,
he
take
(
as
be
common
enough
)
<EOS>
the
bad
course
,
and
,
instead
of
expose
her
to
the
lady
,
which
would
have
be
of
little
consequence
,
he
choose
to
expose
the
lady
to
her
;
he
therefore
resolve
to
hide
Honour
,
whom
he
have
but
just
time
to
convey
behind
the
bed
,
and
to
draw
the
curtain
.
  
<EOS>
the
hurry
in
which
Jones
have
be
all
day
engage
on
account
of
his
poor
landlady
and
her
family
<EOS>
,
the
terror
occasion
by
Mrs
Honour
,
and
the
confusion
into
which
he
be
throw
by
the
sudden
arrival
of
Lady
Bellaston
,
have
altogether
drive
former
thought
out
of
his
head
;
so
that
it
never
once
occur
to
his
memory
to
act
the
part
of
a
sick
man
;
which
,
indeed
,
neither
the
gaiety
of
his
dress
,
nor
the
freshness
of
his
countenance
,
would
have
at
all
support
.
  
<EOS>
He
receive
her
ladyship
therefore
rather
agreeably
to
her
desire
than
to
her
expectation
,
with
all
the
good
humour
he
could
muster
in
his
countenance
,
and
without
any
real
or
affected
appearance
of
the
least
disorder
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Bellaston
no
sooner
enter
the
room
,
than
she
squat
herself
down
on
the
bed
:
"
so
,
my
dear
Jones
,
"
say
she
,
"
you
find
nothing
can
detain
me
long
from
you
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
ought
to
be
angry
with
you
,
that
I
have
neither
see
nor
hear
from
you
all
day
;
for
I
perceive
your
distemper
would
have
suffer
you
to
come
abroad
:
<EOS>
nay
,
I
suppose
you
have
not
sit
in
your
chamber
all
day
drest
up
like
a
fine
lady
to
see
company
after
a
lying
-
in
;
but
,
however
,
do
not
think
I
intend
to
scold
you
;
for
I
never
will
give
you
an
excuse
for
the
cold
behaviour
of
a
husband
,
by
put
on
the
ill
-
humour
of
a
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Lady
Bellaston
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
I
be
sure
your
ladyship
will
not
upbraid
me
with
neglect
of
duty
,
when
I
only
wait
for
order
.
<EOS>
who
,
my
dear
creature
,
hath
reason
to
complain
?
<EOS>
who
miss
an
appointment
last
night
,
and
leave
an
unhappy
man
to
expect
,
and
wish
,
and
sigh
,
and
languish
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
mention
it
,
my
dear
Mr
Jones
,
"
cry
she
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
know
the
occasion
,
you
would
pity
me
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
it
be
impossible
to
conceive
what
woman
of
condition
be
oblige
to
suffer
from
the
impertinence
of
fool
,
in
order
to
keep
up
the
farce
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
be
glad
,
however
,
all
your
languishing
and
wish
have
do
you
no
harm
;
for
you
never
look
better
in
your
life
.
<EOS>
upon
my
faith
!
<EOS>
Jones
,
you
may
at
this
instant
sit
for
the
picture
of
Adonis
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
certain
word
of
provocation
which
man
of
honour
hold
can
properly
be
answer
only
by
a
blow
.
<EOS>
among
lover
possibly
there
may
be
some
expression
which
can
be
answer
only
by
a
kiss
.
<EOS>
now
the
compliment
which
Lady
Bellaston
now
make
Jones
seem
to
be
of
this
kind
,
especially
as
it
be
attend
with
a
look
,
in
which
the
lady
convey
more
soft
idea
than
it
be
possible
to
express
with
her
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
be
certainly
at
this
instant
in
one
of
the
most
disagreeable
and
distressed
situation
imaginable
;
for
,
to
carry
on
the
comparison
we
make
use
of
before
,
though
the
provocation
be
give
by
the
lady
,
Jones
could
not
receive
satisfaction
,
nor
so
much
as
offer
to
ask
it
,
in
the
presence
of
a
third
person
;
second
in
this
kind
of
duel
not
be
accord
to
the
law
of
arm
.
<EOS>
as
this
objection
do
not
occur
to
Lady
Bellaston
,
who
be
ignorant
of
any
other
woman
be
there
but
herself
,
she
wait
some
time
in
great
astonishment
for
an
answer
from
Jones
,
who
,
conscious
of
the
ridiculous
figure
he
make
,
stand
at
a
distance
,
and
,
not
dare
to
give
the
proper
answer
,
give
none
at
all
.
<EOS>
nothing
can
be
imagine
more
comic
,
nor
yet
more
tragical
,
than
this
scene
would
have
be
if
it
have
last
much
longer
.
<EOS>
the
lady
have
already
change
colour
two
or
three
time
;
have
get
up
from
the
bed
and
sit
down
again
,
while
Jones
be
wish
the
ground
to
sink
under
him
,
or
the
house
to
fall
on
his
head
,
when
an
odd
accident
free
him
from
an
embarrassment
out
of
which
neither
the
eloquence
of
a
Cicero
,
nor
the
politic
of
a
Machiavel
,
could
have
deliver
him
,
without
utter
disgrace
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
no
other
than
the
arrival
of
young
Nightingale
,
dead
drunk
;
or
rather
in
that
state
of
drunkenness
which
deprive
man
of
the
use
of
their
reason
without
deprive
them
of
the
use
of
their
limb
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Miller
and
her
daughter
be
in
bed
,
and
Partridge
be
smoake
his
pipe
by
the
kitchen
fire
;
so
that
he
arrive
at
Mr
Jones
's
chamber
-
door
without
any
interruption
.
<EOS>
this
he
burst
open
,
and
be
enter
without
any
ceremony
,
when
Jones
start
from
his
seat
and
run
to
oppose
him
,
which
he
do
so
effectually
,
that
Nightingale
never
come
far
enough
within
the
door
to
see
who
be
sit
on
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
Nightingale
have
in
reality
mistaken
Jones
's
apartment
for
that
<EOS>
in
which
himself
have
lodge
;
he
therefore
strongly
insist
on
come
in
,
often
swear
that
he
would
not
be
keep
from
his
own
bed
.
<EOS>
Jones
,
however
,
prevail
over
him
,
and
deliver
him
into
the
hand
of
Partridge
,
whom
the
noise
on
the
stair
soon
summon
to
his
master
's
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
Jones
be
unwillingly
oblige
to
return
to
his
own
apartment
,
<EOS>
where
at
the
very
instant
of
his
entrance
he
hear
Lady
Bellaston
vent
an
exclamation
,
though
not
a
very
loud
one
;
and
at
the
same
time
see
her
fling
herself
into
a
chair
in
a
vast
agitation
,
which
in
a
lady
of
a
tender
constitution
would
have
be
an
hysteric
fit
.
  
<EOS>
in
reality
the
lady
,
frighten
with
the
struggle
between
the
two
man
,
of
which
she
do
not
know
what
would
be
the
issue
,
as
she
hear
Nightingale
swear
many
oath
he
would
come
to
his
own
bed
,
attempt
to
retire
to
her
known
place
of
hiding
,
which
to
her
great
confusion
she
find
already
occupy
by
another

<EOS>
"
be
this
usage

the
lady

expose
me

wretch

burst
in
a
violent
rage
from
her
place
of
concealment
 
<EOS>

wretch
forsooth

<EOS>
as
poor
a

as
I

I
be

more
than
some

"
  
<EOS>
Jones
,
instead
of
apply
himself
directly
to
take
off
the
edge
of
Mrs
Honour
's
resentment
,
as
a
more
experienced
gallant
would
have
do
,
fall
to
curse
his
star
,
and
lament
himself
as
the
most
unfortunate
man
in
the
world
;
and
presently
after
,
address
himself
to
Lady
Bellaston
,
he
fall
to
some
very
absurd
protestation
of
innocence
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
the
lady
,
have
recover
the
use
of
her
reason
,
which
she
have
as
ready
as
any
woman
in
the
world
,
especially
on
such
occasion
,
calmly
reply
:
"
Sir
,
you
need
make
no
apology
,
I
see
now
who
the
person
be
;
I
do
not
at
first
know
Mrs
Honour
:
but
now
I
do
,
I
can
suspect
nothing
wrong
between
her
and
you
;
and
I
be
sure
she
be
a
woman
of
too
good
sense
to
put
any
wrong
construction
upon
my
visit
to
you
;
I
have
be
always
her
friend

it
may
be
in
my
power
to
be
much
more
hereafter

<EOS>
Mrs
Honour
be
altogether
as
placable
as
she
be
passionate
.
<EOS>
hearing
,
therefore
,
Lady
Bellaston
assume
the
soft
tone
,
she
likewise
soften
her

<EOS>
"
I
be
sure

madam

"
say
she
,
"
I
have
be
always
ready
to
acknowledge
your

's
friendship
to
me
;
sure
I
never
have
so
good
a
friend
as
your
ladyship
 
and
to
be
sure
<EOS>
,
now
I
see
it
be
your
ladyship
that
I
speak
to
<EOS>
,
I
could
almost
bite
my
tongue
off
for
very
mad
.
 
<EOS>
I
construction
upon
your
ladyship
 
to
be
sure
it
doth
<EOS>
not
become
a
servant
as
I
be
to
think
about
such
a
great
lady
 
<EOS>
I
mean
I
be
a
servant
<EOS>
:
for
indeed
I
be
nobody

servant
now

the
more
miserable
wretch

<EOS>
I
have
lose
the
good

"
do

the

"
<EOS>
She
then
take
up
her
fan
which
lie
on
the
ground
,
and
without
even
look
at
Jones
walk
very
majestically
out
of
the
room
;
there
be
a
kind
of
dignity
in
the
impudence
of
woman
of
quality
,
which
their
inferior
vainly
aspire
to
attain
to
in
circumstance
of
this
nature
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
follow
her
downstair
,
often
offer
her
his
hand
,
which
she
absolutely
refuse
him
,
and
get
into
her
chair
without
take
any
notice
of
him
as
he
stand
bow
before
her
.
  
<EOS>
at
his
return
upstairs
,
a
long
dialogue
past
between
him
and
Mrs
Honour
,
while
she
be
adjust
herself
after
the
discomposure
she
have
undergo
.
<EOS>
the
subject
of
this
be
his
infidelity
to
her
young
lady
;
on
which
she
enlarge
with
great
bitterness
;
but
Jones
at
last
find
mean
to
reconcile
her
,
and
not
only
so
,
but
to
obtain
a
promise
of
most
inviolable
secrecy
,
and
that
she
would
the
next
morning
endeavour
to
find
out
Sophia
,
and
bring
him
a
further
account
of
the
proceeding
of
the
squire
.
  
<EOS>
thus
end
this
unfortunate
adventure
to
the
satisfaction
only
of
Mrs
Honour
;
for
a
secret
(
as
some
of
my
reader
will
perhaps
acknowledge
from
experience
)
be
often
a
very
valuable
possession
:
and
that
not
only
to
those
who
faithfully
keep
it
,
but
sometimes
to
such
as
whisper
it
about
till
it
come
to
the
ear
of
every
one
except
the
ignorant
person
who
pay
for
the
suppose
concealing
of
what
be
publickly

<EOS>
Short
and
sweet
.
 
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
the
obligation
she
have
receive
from
Jones
,
Mrs
Miller
could
not
forbear
in
the
morning
some
gentle
remonstrance
for
the
hurricane
which
have
happen
the
precede
night
in
his
chamber
.
<EOS>
these
be
,
however
,
so
gentle
and
so
friendly
,
profess
,
and
indeed
truly
,
to
aim
at
nothing
more
than
the
real
good
of
Mr
Jones
himself
,
that
he
,
far
from
be
offend
,
thankfully
receive
the
admonition
of
the
good
woman
,
express
much
concern
for
what
have
past
,
excuse
it
as
well
as
he
could
,
and
promise
never
more
to
bring
the
same
disturbance
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
Mrs
Miller
do
not
refrain
from
a
short
expostulation
in
private
at
their
first
meeting
,
yet
the
occasion
of
his
be
summon
downstairs
<EOS>
that
morning
be
of
a
much
more
agreeable
kind
,
be
indeed
to
perform
the
office
of
a
father
to
Miss
Nancy
,
and
to
give
her
in
wedlock
to
Mr
Nightingale
,
who
be
now
ready
dr
,
and
full
as
sober
as
many
of
my
reader
will
think
a
man
ought
to
be
who
receive
a
wife
in
so
imprudent
a
manner
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
perhaps
it
may
be
proper
to
account
for
the
escape
which
this
young
gentleman
have
make
from
his
uncle
,
and
for
his
appearance
in
the
condition
in
which
we
have
see
him
the
night
before
.
  
<EOS>
now
when
the
uncle
have
arrive
at
his
lodging
with
his
nephew
,
partly
to
indulge
his
own
inclination
(
for
he
dearly
love
his
bottle
)
,
and
partly
to
disqualify
his
nephew
from
the
immediate
execution
of
his
purpose
,
he
order
wine
to
be
set
on
the
table
;
with
which
he
so
briskly
ply
the
young
gentleman
,
that
this
latter
,
who
,
though
not
much
use
to
drinking
,
do
not
detest
it
so
as
to
be
guilty
of
disobedience
or
want
of
complacence
by
refuse
,
be
soon
completely
finish
.
  
<EOS>
just
as
the
uncle
have
obtain
this
victory
,
and
be
prepare
a
bed
for
his
nephew
,
a
messenger
arrive
with
a
piece
of
news
,
which
so
entirely
disconcert
and
shock
him
,
that
he
in
a
moment
lose
all
consideration
for
his
nephew
,
and
his
whole
mind
become
entirely
take
up
with
his
own
concern
.
  
<EOS>
this
sudden
and
afflict
news
be
no
less
than
that
his
daughter
have
take
the
opportunity
of
almost
the
first
moment
of
his
absence
,
and
have
go
off
with
a
neighbour
young
clergyman
;
against
whom
,
though
her
father
could
have
have
but
one
objection
,
namely
,
that
he
be
worth
nothing
,
yet
she
have
never
think
proper
to
communicate
her
amour
even
to
that
father
;
and
so
artfully
have
she
manage
,
that
it
have
never
be
once
suspect
by
any
,
till
now
that
it
be
consummate
.
  
<EOS>
Old
Mr
Nightingale
no
sooner
receive
this
account
,
than
in
the
utmost
confusion
he
order
a
post
-
chaise
to
be
instantly
get
ready
,
and
,
have
recommend
his
nephew
to
the
care
of
a
servant
,
he
directly
leave
the
house
,
scarce
know
what
he
do
,
nor
whither
he
go
.
  
<EOS>
the
uncle
thus
depart
,
when
the
servant
come
to
attend
the
nephew
to
bed
,
have
wake
him
for
that
purpose
,
and
have
at
last
make
him
sensible
that
his
uncle
be
go
<EOS>
,
he
,
instead
of
accept
the
kind
office
tender
him
,
insist
on
a
chair
be
call
;
with
this
the
servant
,
who
have
receive
no
strict
order
to
the
contrary
,
readily
comply
;
and
,
thus
be
conduct
back
to
the
house
of
Mrs
Miller
,
he
have
stagger
up
to
Mr
Jones
's
chamber
,
as
hath
be
before
recount
.
  
<EOS>
this
bar
of
the
uncle
be
now
remove
(
though
young
Nightingale
know
not
as
yet
in
what
manner
)
,
and
all
party
be
quickly
ready
,
the
mother
,
Mr
Jones
,
Mr
Nightingale
,
and
his
love
,
stept
into
a
hackney
-
coach
,
which
convey
them
to
doctor
'
common
;
where
Miss
Nancy
be
,
in
vulgar
language
,
soon
make
an
honest
woman
,
and
the
poor
mother
become
,
in
the
pure
sense
of
the
word
,
one
of
the
happy
of
all
human
being
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
Mr
Jones
,
have
see
his
good
office
to
that
poor
woman
and
her
family
bring
to
a
happy
conclusion
,
begin
to
apply
himself
to
his
own
concern
;
but
here
,
lest
many
of
my
reader
should
censure
his
folly
for
thus
trouble
himself
with
the
affair
of
other
,
and
lest
some
few
should
think
he
act
more
disinterestedly
than
indeed
he
do
<EOS>
,
we
think
proper
to
assure
our
reader
,
that
he
be
so
far
from
be
unconcerned
in
this
matter
,
that
he
have
indeed
a
very
considerable
interest
in
bring
it
to
that
final
consummation
.
  
<EOS>
to
explain
this
seem
paradox
at
once
,
he
be
one
who
could
truly
say
with
him
in
Terence
,
Homo
sum
:
<EOS>
humani
nihil
a
me
alienum
puto
.
<EOS>
He
be
never
an
indifferent
spectator
of
the
misery
or
happiness
of
any
one
;
and
he
feel
either
the
one
or
the
other
in
great
proportion
as
he
himself
contribute
to
either
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
,
therefore
,
be
the
instrument
of
raise
a
whole
family
from
the
low
state
of
wretchedness
to
the
high
pitch
of
joy
without
convey
great
felicity
to
himself
;
more
perhaps
than
worldly
man
often
purchase
to
themselves
by
undergo
the
most
severe
labour
,
and
often
by
wade
through
the
deep
iniquity
.
  
<EOS>
those
reader
who
be
of
the
same
complexion
with
him
will
perhaps
think
this
short
chapter
contain
abundance
of
matter
;
while
other
may
probably
wish
,
short
as
it
be
,
that
it
have
be
totally
spare
as
impertinent
to
the
main
design
,
which
I
suppose
they
conclude
be
to
bring
Mr
Jones
to
the
gallow
,
or
,
if
possible
,
to
a
more
deplorable
catastrophe
.
    
<EOS>
contain
love
-
letter
of
several
sort
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jones
,
at
his
return
home
,
find
the
follow
letter
lie
on
his
table

he
luckily
open
in
the

<EOS>
"

I

some
strange
infatuation

a

<EOS>

Jones
have
just
read
over
these
three
billet
when
Mr
Nightingale
come
into
the
room

for

no
secret
to
any
one
in

house

the

be
)
.
"
<EOS>
the
Lady
Bellaston
?
"
answer
Jones
very
gravely
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
dear
Tom
,
"
cry
Nightingale
,
"
do
not
be
so
reserved
to
your
friend
.
<EOS>
though
I
be
too
drunk
to
see
her
last
night
,
I
see
her
at
the
masquerade
.
<EOS>
do
you
think
I
be
ignorant
who
the
queen
of
the
fairy
be
?
"
<EOS>
"
and
do
you
really
then
know
the
lady
at
the
masquerade
?
"
say
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
upon
my
soul
,
do
I
,
"
say
Nightingale
,
"
and
have
give
you
twenty
hint
of
it
since
,
though
you
seem
always
so
tender
on
that
point
,
that
I
would
not
speak
plainly
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
,
my
friend
,
by
your
extreme
nicety
in
this
matter
<EOS>
,
you
be
not
so
well
acquaint
with
the
character
of
the
lady
as
with
her
person
.
<EOS>
do
not
be
angry
,
Tom
,
but
upon
my
honour
,
you
be
not
the
first
young
fellow
<EOS>
she
hath
debauch
.
<EOS>
Her
reputation
be
in
no
danger
,
believe
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
though
Jones
have
no
reason
to
imagine
the
lady
to
have
be
of
the
vestal
kind
when
his
amour
begin
;
yet
,
as
he
be
thoroughly
ignorant
of
the
town
,
and
have
very
little
acquaintance
in
it
,
he
have
no
knowledge
of
that
character
which
be
vulgarly
call
a
demirep
;
that
be
to
say
,
a
woman
who
intrigue
with
every
man
she
like
,
under
the
name
and
appearance
of
virtue
;
and
who
,
though
some
over
-
nice
lady
will
not
be
see
with
her
,
be
visit
(
as
they
term
it
)
by
the
whole
town
,
in
short
,
whom
everybody
know
to
be
what
nobody
call
her
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
find
,
therefore
,
that
Nightingale
be
perfectly
acquaint
with
his
intrigue
,
and
begin
to
suspect
that
so
scrupulous
a
delicacy
as
he
have
hitherto
observe
be
not
quite
necessary
on
the
occasion
,
he
give
a
latitude
to
his
friend
's
tongue
,
and
desire
him
to
speak
plainly
what
he
know
,
or
have
ever
hear
of
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
Nightingale
,
who
,
in
many
other
instance
,
be
rather
too
effeminate
in
his
disposition
,
have
a
pretty
strong
inclination
to
tittle
-
tattle
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
sooner
,
therefore
,
receive
a
full
liberty
of
speak
from
Jones
,
than
he
enter
upon
a
long
narrative
concern
the
lady
;
which
,
as
it
contain
many
particular
highly
to
her
dishonour
,
we
have
too
great
a
tenderness
for
all
woman
of
condition
to
repeat
.
<EOS>
We
would
cautiously
avoid
give
an
opportunity
to
the
future
commentator
on
our
work
,
of
make
any
malicious
application
and
of
force
us
to
be
,
against
our
will
,
the
author
of
scandal
,
which
never
enter
into
our
head
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
,
have
very
attentively
hear
all
that
Nightingale
have
to
say
,
fetch
a
deep
sigh
;
<EOS>
which
the
other
,
observe
,
cry
,
"
Heyday
!
<EOS>
why
,
thou
art
not
in
love
,
I
hope
!
<EOS>
have
I
imagine
my
story
would
have
affect
you
<EOS>
,
I
promise
you
should
never
have
hear
them
.
"
<EOS>
"
o
my
dear
friend
!
"
cry
Jones
,
"
I
be
so
entangle
with
this
woman
,
that
I
know
not
how
to
extricate
myself
.
<EOS>
in
love
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
no
,
my
friend
,
<EOS>
but
I
be
under
obligation
to
her
,
and
<EOS>
very
great
one
.
<EOS>
since
you
know
so
much
,
I
will
be
very
explicit
with
you
.
<EOS>
It
be
owing
,
perhaps
,
solely
to
her
,
that
I
have
not
,
before
this
,
want
a
bit
of
bread
.
<EOS>
how
can
I
possibly
desert
such
a
woman
?
<EOS>
and
yet
I
must
desert
her
,
or
be
guilty
of
the
black
treachery
to
one
who
deserve
infinitely
well
of
me
than
she
can
;
a
woman
,
my
Nightingale
,
for
whom
I
have
a
passion
which
few
can
have
an
idea
of
.
<EOS>
I
be
half
distract
with
doubt
how
to
act
.
"
<EOS>
"
and
be
this
other
,
pray
,
an
honourable
mistress
?
"
cry
Nightingale
.
"
<EOS>
honourable
!
"
<EOS>
answer
Jones
;
"
no
breath
ever
yet
durst
sully
her
reputation
.
<EOS>
the
sweetest
air
be
not
purer
,
the
limpid
stream
not
clear
,
than
her
honour
.
<EOS>
She
be
all
over
,
both
in
mind
and
body
,
consummate
perfection
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
most
beautiful
creature
in
the
universe
:
and
yet
she
be
mistress
of
such
noble
elevated
quality
,
that
,
though
she
be
never
from
my
thought
,
I
scarce
ever
think
of
her
beauty
<EOS>
but
when
I
see
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
can
you
,
my
good
friend
,
"
cry
Nightingale
,
"
with
such
an
engagement
as
this
upon
your
hand
,
hesitate
a
moment
about
quit
such
a
"
"
hold
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
no
more
abuse
of
her
:
<EOS>
I
detest
the
thought
of
ingratitude
.
"
<EOS>
"
Pooh
!
"
answer
the
other
,
"
you
be
not
the
first
upon
whom
she
hath
confer
obligation
of
this
kind
.
<EOS>
She
be
remarkably
liberal
where
she
like
;
though
,
let
me
tell
you
,
<EOS>
her
favour
be
so
prudently
bestow
,
that
they
should
rather
raise
a
man
's
vanity
than
his
gratitude
.
"
<EOS>
in
short
,
Nightingale
proceed
so
far
on
this
head
,
and
tell
his
friend
so
many
story
of
the
lady
,
which
he
swear
to
the
truth
of
,
that
he
entirely
remove
all
esteem
for
her
from
the
breast
of
Jones
;
and
his
gratitude
be
lessen
in
proportion
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
begin
to
look
on
all
the
favour
he
have
receive
rather
as
wage
than
benefit
,
which
depreciate
not
only
her
,
but
himself
too
in
his
own
conceit
,
and
put
him
quite
out
of
humour
with
both
.
<EOS>
from
this
disgust
,
his
mind
,
by
a
natural
transition
,
turn
towards
Sophia
;
her
virtue
,
her
purity
,
her
love
to
him
,
her
suffering
on
his
account
,
fill
all
his
thought
,
and
make
his
commerce
with
Lady
Bellaston
appear
still
more
odious
.
<EOS>
the
result
of
all
be
,
that
,
though
his
turn
himself
out
of
her
service
,
in
which
light
he
now
see
his
affair
with
her
,
would
be
the
loss
of
his
bread
;
yet
he
determine
to
quit
her
,
if
he
could
but
find
a
handsome
pretence
:
which
be
communicate
to

I

I

Jones

Nightingale

she
will
declare
off
in

<EOS>
Jones
declare
he
could
not
venture
the
experiment

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
perhaps
,
"
say
he
,
"
she
may
be
less
shocked
at
this
proposal
from
one
man
than
from
another

if
she
should
take
me
at
my
word

where
be
I
then

<EOS>
catch
,
in
my
own
trap

undone
for
ever

"
<EOS>
"
no

"
answer
Nightingale
,
"
not
if
I
can
give
you
an
expedient
by
which
you
may
at
any
time
get
out
of
the
trap

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
expedient
can
that
be
?
"
<EOS>
reply
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
this

answer
Nightingale

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
young
fellow
I
mention
,
who
be
one
of
the
most
intimate
acquaintance
I
have
in
the
world
,
be
so
angry
with
her
for
some
ill
office
she
hath
since
do
him
,
that
I
be
sure
he
would
,
without
any
difficulty
,
give
you
a
sight
of
her
letter
;
upon
which
you
may
decently
break
with
her
;
and
declare
off
before
the
knot
be
tye
,
if
she
should
really
be
willing

tie
it

she

not

"
  
<EOS>
after
some
hesitation
,
Jones
,
upon
the
strength
of
this
assurance
,
consent
;
but
,
as
he
swear
he
want
the
confidence
to
propose
the
matter
to
her
face

he
write
the
follow
letter

Nightingale
dictate
:
      
"
MADAM

I
be
extremely
concerned

that

by
an
unfortunate
engagement
  
abroad
,
I
should
have
miss
receive
the
honour
of
your

's
  
command
the
moment
they
come
;
and
the
delay
which
I
must
now
suffer
  
of
vindicate
myself
to
your
ladyship
greatly
add
to
this
  
misfortune
.
<EOS>
o
,
Lady
Bellaston
!
<EOS>
what
a
terror
have
I
be
in
for
fear
  
<EOS>
your
reputation
should
be
expose
by
these
perverse
accident
!
<EOS>
there
  
be
one
only
way
to
secure
it

<EOS>
I
need
not

what
that
be

<EOS>
only
  
permit
me
to
say
,
that
as
your
honour
be
as
dear

me

so
  
my
sole

I

"
  
<EOS>
to
this
she
presently
return
the
follow
answer
:
    
"
SIR
,
    
"
when
I
read
over
your
serious
epistle
,
I
could
,
from
its
coldness
  
and
formality
,
have
swear
that
you
already
have
the
legal
right
<EOS>
you
  
mention
;
<EOS>
nay
,
that
we
have
for
many
year
compose
that
monstrous
  
animal
a
husband
and
wife
.
<EOS>
do
you
really
then
imagine
me
a
fool
?
<EOS>
or
  
do
you
fancy
yourself
capable
of
so
entirely
persuade
me
out
of
my
  
sense
,
that
I
should
deliver
my
whole
fortune
into
your
power
,
in
  
order
to
enable
you
to
support
your
pleasure
at
my
expense

<EOS>
be
  
these
the
proof
of
love
which
I
expect
?
<EOS>
be
this
the
return
for
?
  
<EOS>

I
scorn
to
upbraid
you

be
in
great
admiration

your
  
profound
respect

P.S.
<EOS>
I
be
prevent
from
revise
:
 
<EOS>
perhaps
I
have
say
more
than
  
<EOS>
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
come
to
me
at
eight
this
evening

"
  
<EOS>
Jones
,
by
the
advice
of
his
privy
-
council
,
reply
:
    
"
MADAM
,
    
<EOS>
"
It
be
impossible
to
express
how
much
I
be
shock
at
the
suspicion
  
<EOS>
you
entertain
of
me
.
<EOS>
Can
Lady
Bellaston
have
confer
favour
on
a
  
man
whom
she
could
believe
capable
of
so
base
a
design
?
<EOS>
or
can
she
  
treat
the
most
solemn
tie
of
love
with
contempt
?
<EOS>
Can
you
imagine
,
  
madam
,
that
if
the
violence
of
my
passion
,
in
an
unguarded
moment
,
  
overcome
the
tenderness
which
I
have
for
your
honour
,
I
would
think
  
of
indulge
myself
in
the
continuance
of
an
intercourse
which
could
  
not
possibly
escape
long
the
notice
of
the
world
;
and
which
,
when
  
discover
,
must
prove
so
fatal
to
your
reputation
?
<EOS>
if
such
be
your
  
opinion
of
me
,
I
must
pray
for
a
sudden
opportunity
of
return
  
those
pecuniary
obligation
,
which
I
have
be
so
unfortunate
to
  
receive
at
your
hand
;
and
for
those
of
a
more
tender
kind
,
I
shall
  
ever
remain
,
&
c.
"
<EOS>
and
so
conclude
in
the
very
word
with
which
he
  
have
conclude
the
former
letter
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
answer
as
follow
:
    
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
be
a
villain
!
<EOS>
and
I
despise
you
from
my
soul
.
<EOS>
if
you
  
come
here
I
shall
not
be
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
though
Jones
be
well
satisfied
with
his
deliverance
from
a
thraldom
which
those
who
have
ever
experience
it
will
,
I
apprehend
,
allow
to
be
none
of
the
light
,
he
be
not
,
however
,
perfectly
easy
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
there
be
in
this
scheme
too
much
of
fallacy
to
satisfy
one
who
utterly
detest
every
species
of
falshood
or
dishonesty
:
nor
would
he
,
indeed
,
have
submit
to
put
it
in
practice
,
have
he
not
be
involve
in
a
distressful
situation
,
where
he
be
oblige
to
be
guilty
of
some
dishonour
,
either
to
the
one
lady
or
the
other
;
and
surely
the
reader
will
allow
,
that
every
good
principle
,
as
well
as
love
,
plead
strongly
in
favour
of
Sophia
.
  
<EOS>
Nightingale
highly
exult
in
the
success
of
his
stratagem
,
upon
which
he
receive
many
thank
and
much
applause
from
his
friend
.
<EOS>
He
answer
,
"
dear
Tom
,
we
have
confer
very
different
obligation
on
each
other
.
<EOS>
to
me
you
owe
the
regain
your
liberty
;
to
you
I
owe
the
loss
of
mine
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
be
as
happy
in
the
one
instance
as
I
be
in
the
other
,
I
promise
you
we
be
the
two
happy
fellow
in
England
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
two
gentleman
be
now
summon
down
to
dinner
,
where
Mrs
Miller
,
who
perform
herself
the
office
of
cook
,
have
exert
her
good
talent
to
celebrate
the
wedding
of
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
this
joyful
circumstance
she
ascribe
principally
to
the
friendly
behaviour
of
Jones
,
her
whole
soul
be
fire
with
gratitude
towards
him
,
and
all
her
look
,
word
,
and
action
,
be
so
busied
in
express
it
,
that
her
daughter
,
and
even
her
new
son
-
in
-
law
,
be
very
little
object
of
her
consideration
.
  
<EOS>
dinner
be
just
end
when
Mrs
Miller
receive
a
letter
;
but
as
we
have
have
letter
enow
in
this
chapter
,
we
shall
communicate
its
content
in
our
next
.
    
<EOS>
consist
partly
of
fact
,
and
partly
of
observation
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
letter
then
which
arrive
at
the
end
of
the
precede
chapter
be
from
Mr
Allworthy
,
and
the
purport
of
it
be
,
his
intention
to
come
immediately
to
town
,
with
his
nephew
Blifil
,
and
a
desire
to
be
accommodate
with
his
usual
lodging
,
which
be
the
first
floor
for
himself
,
and
the
second
for
his
nephew
.
  
<EOS>
the
chearfulness
which
have
before
display
itself
in
the
countenance
of
the
poor
woman
be
a
little
clouded
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
this
news
do
indeed
a
good
deal
disconcert
her
.
<EOS>
to
requite
so
disintereste
a
match
with
her
daughter
,
by
presently
turn
her
new
son
-
in
-
law
out
of
door
,
appear
to
her
very
unjustifiable
on
the
one
hand
;
and
on
the
other
,
she
could
scarce
bear
the
thought
of
make
any
excuse
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
after
all
the
obligation
receive
from
him
,
for
deprive
him
of
lodging
which
be
indeed
strictly
his
due
;
for
that
gentleman
,
in
confer
all
his
numberless
benefit
on
other
,
act
by
a
rule
diametrically
opposite
to
what
be
practise
by
most
generous
people
.
<EOS>
He
contrive
,
on
all
occasion
,
to
hide
his
beneficence
,
not
only
from
the
world
,
but
even
from
the
object
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
constantly
use
the
word
lend
and
pay
,
instead
of
give
;
and
by
every
other
method
he
could
invent
,
always
lessen
with
his
tongue
the
favour
he
confer
,
while
he
be
heap
them
with
both
his
hand
.
<EOS>
when
he
settle
the
annuity
of
L50
a
year
therefore
on
Mrs
Miller
,
he
tell
her
,
"
it
be
in
consideration
of
always
have
her
first
-
floor
when
he
be
in
town
(
which
he
scarce
ever
intend
to
be
)
,
but
that
she
may
let
it
at
any
other
time
,
for
that
he
would
always
send
her
a
month
's
warning
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
now
,
however
,
hurry
to
town
so
suddenly
,
that
he
have
no
opportunity
of
give
such
notice
;
and
this
hurry
probably
prevent
him
,
when
he
write
for
his
lodging
,
add
,
if
they
be
then
empty
;
for
he
would
most
certainly
have
be
well
satisfied
to
have
relinquish
them
,
on
a
less
sufficient
excuse
than
what
Mrs
Miller
could
now
have
make
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
sort
of
person
,
who
,
as
prior
excellently
well
remark
,
direct
their
conduct
by
something
        
beyond
the
fix'd
and
settle
rule
      
of
vice
and
virtue
in
the
school
,
      
beyond
the
letter
of
the
law
.
  
<EOS>
to
these
it
be
so
far
from
be
sufficient
that
their
defence
would
acquit
them
at
the
Old
Bailey
,
that
they
be
not
even
content
,
though
conscience
,
the
severest
of
all
judge
,
should
discharge
them
.
<EOS>
nothing
short
of
the
fair
and
honourable
will
satisfy
the
delicacy
of
their
mind
;
and
if
any
of
their
action
fall
short
of
this
mark
,
they
mope
and
pine
,
be
as
uneasy
and
restless
as
a
murderer
,
who
be
afraid
of
a
ghost
,
or
of
the
hangman
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Miller
be
one
of
these
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
conceal
her
uneasiness
at
this
letter
;
with
the
content
of
which
she
have
no
sooner
acquaint
the
company
,
and
give
some
hint
of
her
distress
,
than
Jones
,
her
good
angel
,
presently
relieve
her
anxiety
.
"
<EOS>
as
for
myself
,
madam
,
"
say
he
,
"
my
lodging
be
at
your
service
at
a
moment
's
warning
;
and
Mr
Nightingale
,
I
be
sure
,
as
he
can
not
yet
prepare
a
house
fit
to
receive
his
lady
,
will
consent
to
return
to
his
new
lodging
,
whither
Mrs
Nightingale
will
certainly
consent
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
with
which
proposal
both
husband
and
wife
instantly
agree
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
will
easily
believe
,
that
the
cheek
of
Mrs
Miller
begin
again
to
glow
with
additional
gratitude
to
Jones
;
but
,
perhaps
,
it
may
be
more
difficult
to
persuade
him
,
that
Mr
Jones
have
in
his
last
speech
call
her
daughter
Mrs
Nightingale
(
it
be
the
first
time
that
agreeable
sound
have
ever
reach
her
ear
)
,
give
the
fond
mother
more
satisfaction
,
and
warm
her
heart
more
towards
Jones
,
than
his
have
dissipate
her
present
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
be
then
appoint
for
the
removal
of
the
new
-
married
couple
,
and
of
Mr
Jones
,
who
be
likewise
to
be
provide
for
in
the
same
house
with
his
friend
.
<EOS>
and
now
the
serenity
of
the
company
be
again
restore
,
and
they
past
the
day
in
the
utmost
chearfulness
,
all
except
Jones
,
who
,
though
he
outwardly
accompany
the
rest
in
their
mirth
,
feel
many
a
bitter
pang
on
the
account
of
his
Sophia
,
which
be
not
a
little
heighten
by
the
news
of
Mr
Blifil
be
come
to
town
<EOS>
(
for
he
clearly
see
the
intention
of
his
journey
)
;
and
what
greatly
aggravate
his
concern
be
,
that
Mrs
Honour
,
who
have
promise
to
inquire
after
Sophia
,
and
to
make
her
report
to
him
early
the
next
evening
,
have
disappoint
him
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
situation
that
he
and
his
mistress
be
in
at
this
time
,
there
be
scarce
any
ground
for
him
to
hope
that
he
should
hear
any
good
news
;
yet
he
be
as
impatient
to
see
Mrs
Honour
as
if
he
have
expect
she
would
bring
him
a
letter
with
an
assignation
in
it
from
Sophia
,
and
bear
the
disappointment
as
ill
.
<EOS>
whether
this
impatience
arise
from
that
natural
weakness
of
the
human
mind
,
which
make
it
desirous
to
know
the
bad
,
and
render
uncertainty
the
most
intolerable
of
pain
;
or
whether
he
still
flatter
himself
with
some
secret
hope
,
we
will
not
determine
.
<EOS>
but
that
it
may
be
the
last
,
whoever
have
love
can
not
but
know
.
<EOS>
for
of
all
the
power
exercise
by
this
passion
over
our
mind
,
one
of
the
most
wonderful
be
that
of
support
hope
in
the
midst
of
despair
.
<EOS>
difficulty
,
improbability
,
nay
,
impossibility
,
be
quite
overlook
by
it
;
so
<EOS>
that
to
any
man
extremely
in
love
,
may
be
apply
what
Addison
say
of
Caesar
,
        
"
the
Alps
,
and
Pyrenaeans
,
sink
before
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
yet
it
be
equally
true
,
that
the
same
passion
will
sometimes
make
mountain
of
molehill
,
and
produce
despair
in
the
midst
of
hope
;
but
these
cold
fit
last
not
long
in
good
constitution
.
<EOS>
which
temper
Jones
be
now
in
,

Various
be
the
conjecture
which
Jones
entertain
on
this
step
of
Lady
Bellaston
;
who
,
in
reality
,
have
little
farth
design
than
to
secure
within
her
own
house
the
repository
of
a
secret
,
which
she
choose
should
make
no
farther
progress
than
it
have
make
already
;
but
mostly
,
she
desire
to
keep
it
from
the
ear
of
Sophia
;
for
though
that
young
lady
be
almost
the
only
one
who
would
never
have
repeat
it
again
,
her
ladyship
could
not
persuade
herself
of
this
;
since
,
as
she
now
hate
poor
Sophia
with
most
implacable
hatred
,
she
conceive
a
reciprocal
hatred
to
herself
to
be
lodge
in
the
tender
breast
of
our
heroine
,
where
no
such
passion
have
ever
yet
find
an
entrance
.
  
<EOS>
while
Jones
be
terrify
himself
with
the
apprehension
of
a
thousand
dreadful
machination
,
and
deep
political
design
,
which
he
imagine
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
promotion
of
Honour
,
Fortune
,
who
hitherto
seem
to
have
be
an
utter
enemy
to
his
match
with
Sophia
,
try
a
new
method
to
put
a
final
end
to
it
,
by
throw
a
temptation
in
his
way
,
which
in
his
present
desperate
situation
it
seem
unlikely
he
should
be
able
to
resist
.
    
<EOS>
contain
curious
,
but
not
unprecedented
matter
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
lady
,
one
Mrs
Hunt
,
who
have
often
see
Jones
at
the
house
where
he
lodge
,
be
intimately
acquaint
with
the
woman
there
,
and
indeed
a
very
great
friend
to
Mrs
Miller
.
<EOS>
Her
age
be
about
thirty
,
for
she
own
six
-
and
-
twenty
;
her
face
and
person
very
good
,
only
incline
a
little
too
much
to
be
fat
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
marry
young
by
her
relation
to
an
old
Turkey
merchant
,
who
,
have
get
a
great
fortune
,
have
leave
off
trade
.
<EOS>
with
him
she
live
without
reproach
,
but
not
without
pain
,
in
a
state
of
great
self
-
denial
,
for
about
twelve
year
;
and
her
virtue
be
reward
by
his
die
and
leave
her
very
rich
.
<EOS>
the
first
year
of
her
widowhood
be
just
at
an
end
,
and
she
have
past
it
in
a
good
deal
of
retirement
,
see
only
a
few
particular
friend
,
and
divide
her
time
between
her
devotion
and
novel
,
of
which
she
be
always
extremely
fond
.
<EOS>
very
good
health
,
a
very
warm
constitution
,
and
a
good
deal
of
religion
,
make
it
absolutely
necessary
for
her
to
marry
again
;
and
she
resolve
to
please
herself
in
her
second
husband
,
as
she
have
do
her
friend
in
the
first
.
<EOS>
from
her
the
following
billet

to
Jones
:
      
<EOS>
"
SIR
,
    
<EOS>
"
from
the
first
day
I
see
you
,
I
doubt
my
eye
have
tell
you
too
  
plainly
that
you
be
not
indifferent
to
me
;
but
neither
my
tongue
  
nor
my
hand
should
have
ever
avow
it
,
have
not
the
lady
of
the
  
family
where
you
be
lodge
give
me
such
a
character
of
you
,
and
  
<EOS>
tell
me
such
proof
of
your
virtue
and
goodness
,
as
convince
me
you
  
be
not
only
the
most
agreeable
,
but
the
most
worthy
of
man
.
<EOS>
I
have
  
also
the
satisfaction
to
hear
from
them
,
that
neither
my
person
,
  
understanding
,
or
character
,
be
disagreeable
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
  
fortune
sufficient
to
make
us
both
happy
,
but
which
can
not
make
me
  
<EOS>
so
without
you
.
<EOS>
in
thus
dispose
of
myself
,
I
know
I
shall
incur
  
the
censure
of
the
world
;
but
if
I
do
not
love
you
more
than
I
fear
  
the
world
,
I
should
not
be
worthy
of
you
.
<EOS>
one
only
difficulty
stop
  
me
:
I
be
inform
you
be
engage
in
a
commerce
of
gallantry
with
a
  
woman
of
fashion
.
<EOS>
if
you
think
it
worth
while
to
sacrifice
that
to
  
the
possession
of
me
,
I
be
yours
;
if
not
,
forget
my
weakness
,
and
  
let
this
remain
an
eternal
secret
between
you
and

ARABELLA
HUNT

"
  
<EOS>
at
the
reading
of
this
,
Jones
be
put
into
a
violent
flutter
.
<EOS>
His
fortune
be
then
at
a
very
low
ebb
,
the
source
be
stopt
from
which
hitherto
he
have
be
supply
.
<EOS>
of
all
he
have
receive
from
Lady
Bellaston
,
not
above
five
guinea
remain
;
and
that
very
morning
he
have
be
dun
by
a
tradesman
for
twice
that
sum
.
<EOS>
His
honourable
mistress
be
in
the
hand
of
her
father
,
and
he
have
scarce
any
hope
ever
to
get
her
out
of
them
again
.
<EOS>
to
be
subsist
at
her
expense
,
from
that
little
fortune
she
have
independent
of
her
father
,
go
much
against
the
delicacy
both
of
his
pride
and
his
love
.
<EOS>
this
lady
's
fortune
would
have
be
exceed
convenient
to
him
,
and
he
could
have
no
objection
to
her
in
any
respect
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
he
like
her
as
well
as
he
do
any
woman
except
Sophia
.
<EOS>
but
to
abandon
Sophia
,
and
marry
another
,
that
be
impossible
;
he
could
not
think
of
it
upon
any
account
,
yet
why
should
he
not
,
since
it
be
plain
she
could
not
be
his
?
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
kind
to
her
,
than
to
continue
her
longer
engage
in
a
hopeless
passion
for
him
?
<EOS>
Ought
he
not
to
do
so
in
friendship
to
her
?
<EOS>
this
notion
prevail
some
moment
,
and
he
have
almost
determine
to
be
false
to
her
from
a
high
point
of
honour
:
but
that
refinement
be
not
able
to
stand
very
long
against
the
voice
of
nature
,
which
cry
in
his
heart
that
such
friendship
be
treason
to
love
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
call
for
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
and
writ
as
follow
to
Mrs
Hunt
:

"
MADAM
,
    
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
but
a
poor
return
to
the
favour
you
have
do
me
to
  
sacrifice
any
gallantry
to
the
possession
of
you
,
and
I
would
  
certainly
do
it
,
though
I
be
not
disengage
,
as
at
present
<EOS>
I
be
,
  
from
any
affair
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
but
I
should
not
be
the
honest
man
you
  
think
me
,
if
I
do
not
tell
you
that
my
affection
be
engage
to
  
another

who
be
a
woman
of
virtue
,
and
one
that
I
never
can
leave
,
  
though
it
be
probable
I
shall
never
possess
her
.
<EOS>
God
forbid
that
,
in
  
return
of
your
kindness
to
me
,
I
should
do
you
such
an
injury
as
to
  
give
you
my
hand
when
I
can
not
give
my
heart

<EOS>
no

I
have
much
rather
  
starve
than
be
guilty
of
that
.
<EOS>
even
though
my
mistress
be
marry
  
to
another

I
would
not
marry
you
unless
my
heart
have
entirely
  
efface
all
impression
of
her

<EOS>
be
assure
that
your

be
not
  
more
safe

be
sure
I
have
reason
to
say
so
;
but
it
will
be
all
one
a
thousand
year
hence
.
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
where
be
I
?
 
<EOS>
o
 
<EOS>
well
,
we
no
sooner
know
each
other
,
than
,
after
many
hearty
shake
by
the
hand
,
we
agree
to
go
to
an
alehouse
and
take
a
pot
,
and
by
good
luck
the
beer
be
some
of
the
good
I
have
meet
with
since
I
have
be
in
town
.
<EOS>
now
,
sir
,
I
be
come
to
the
point
;
for
no
sooner
do
I
name
you
,
and
tell
him
that
you
and
I
come
to
town
together
,
and
have
live
together
ever
since
,
than
he
call
for
another
pot
,
and
swear
he
would
drink
to
your
health
;
and
indeed
he
drink
your
health
so
heartily
that
I
be
overjoyed
to
see
there
be
so
much
gratitude
leave
in
the
world
;
and
after
we
have
empty
that
pot
<EOS>
I
say
I
would
buy
my
pot
too
,
and
so
we
drink
another
to
your
health
;
and
then
I
make
haste
home
to
tell
you
the
news
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
news
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Jones
,
"
you
have
not
mention
a
word
of
my
Sophia
!
"
<EOS>
"
bless
me
!
<EOS>
I
have
like
to
have
forget
that
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
we
mention
a
great
deal
about
young
Madam
Western
,
and
George
tell
me
all
;
that
Mr
Blifil
be
come
to
town
in
order
to
be
married
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
best
make
haste
then
,
say
I
,
or
somebody
will
have
her
before
he
come
;
and
,
indeed
,
say
I
,
Mr
Seagrim
,
it
be
a
thousand
pity
somebody
should
not
have
her
;
for
he
certainly
love
her
above
all
the
woman
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
both
you
<EOS>
and
she
know
,
that
it
be
not
for
her
fortune
he
follow
her
;
for
I
can
assure
you
,
as
to
matter
of
that
,
there
be
another
lady
,
one
of
much
great
quality
and
fortune
than
she
can
pretend
to
,
who
be
so
fond
of
somebody
that
she
come
after
him
day
and
night
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
Jones
fall
into
a
passion
with
Partridge
,
for
have
,
as
he
say
,
betray
him
;
but
the
poor
fellow
answer
,
he
have
mention
no
name
:
"
besides
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
can
assure
you
George
be
sincerely
your
friend
,
and
wish
Mr
Blifil
at
the
devil
more
than
once
<EOS>
;
nay
,
he
say
he
would
do
anything
in
his
power
upon
earth
to
serve
you
;
and
so
I
be
convinced
he
will
.
<EOS>
betray
you
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
why
,
I
question
whether
you
have
a
well
friend
than
George
upon
earth
,
except
myself
,
or
one
that
would
go
farther
to
serve
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Jones
,
a
little
pacified
,
"
you
say
this
fellow
,
who
,
I
believe
,
indeed
,
be
enough
incline
to
be
my
friend
,
live
in
the
same
house
with
Sophia
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
the
same
house
!
"
answer
Partridge
;
"
why
,
sir
,
he
be
one
of
the
servant
of
the
family
,
and
very
well
dr
<EOS>
I
promise
you
he
be
;
if
it
be
not
for
his
black
beard
you
would
hardly
know
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
one
service
then
at
least
he
may
do
me
,
"
say
Jones
:
"
<EOS>
sure
he
can
certainly
convey
a
letter
to
my
Sophia
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
hit
the
nail
ad
unguem
"
cry
Partridge
;
"
how
come
I
not
to
think
of
it
?
<EOS>
I
will
engage
he
shall
do
it
upon
the
very
first
mentioning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
do
you
leave
me
at
present
,
and
I
will
write
a
letter
,
which
you
shall
deliver
to
him
to
-
morrow
morning
;
for
I
suppose
you
know
where
to
find
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
o
yes
,
sir
,
"
answer
Partridge
,
"
I
shall
certainly
find
him
again
<EOS>
;
there
be
no
fear
of
that
.
<EOS>
the
liquor
be
too
good
for
him
to
stay
away
long
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
doubt
but
he
will
be
there
every
day
he
stay
in
town
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
you
do
not
know
the
street
then
where
my
Sophia
be

"
<EOS>
cry
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
sir
,
I
do
,
"
say
Partridge
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
name
of
the
street
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Jones

<EOS>
"
the
name
,
sir

<EOS>
why
,
here
,
sir
,
just
by
,
"
answer
Partridge
,
"
not
above
a
street
or
two
off
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
,
indeed
,
know
the
very
name
;
for
,
as
he
never
tell
me
,
if
I
have
ask
,
you
know
,
it
may
have
put
some
suspicion
into
his
head
.
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
sir
,
let
me
alone
for
that
.
<EOS>
I
be
too
cunning
for
that
,
I
promise
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
art
most
wonderfully
cunning
,
indeed
,
"
reply
Jones
;
"
however
,
I
will
write
to
my
charmer
,
since
I
believe
you
will
be
cunne
enough
to
find
him
to
-
morrow
at
the
alehouse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
have
dismiss
the
sagacious
Partridge
,
Mr
Jones
sit
himself
down
to
write
,
in
which
employment
we
shall
leave
him
for
a
time
.
<EOS>
and
here
we
put
an
end
to
the
fifteenth
book
.
  
<EOS>
BOOK
XVI
.
  
<EOS>
contain
the
space
of
five
day
.
    
<EOS>
of
prologue
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hear
of
a
dramatic
writer
who
use
to
say
,
he
would
rather
write
a
play
than
a
prologue
;
in
like
manner
,
I
think
,
<EOS>
I
can
with
less
pain
write
one
of
the
book
of
this
history
than
the
prefatory
chapter
to
each
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
I
believe
many
a
hearty
curse
hath
be
devote
on
the
head
of
that
author
who
first
institute
the
method
of
prefix
to
his
play
that
portion
of
matter
which
be
call
the
prologue
;
and
which
at
first
be
part
of
the
piece
itself
,
but
of
latter
year
<EOS>
hath
have
usually
so
little
connexion
with
the
drama
before
which
it
stand
,
that
the
prologue
to
one
play
may
as
well
serve
for
any
other
.
<EOS>
those
indeed
of
more
modern
date
,
seem
all
to
be
write
on
the
same
three
topic
,
viz
.
,
an
abuse
of
the
taste
of
the
town
,
a
condemnation
of
all
contemporary
author
,
and
an
eulogium
on
the
performance
just
about
to
be
represent
.
<EOS>
the
sentiment
in
all
these
be
very
little
varied
,
nor
be
it
possible
they
should
;
and
indeed
I
have
often
wonder
at
the
great
invention
of
author
,
who
have
be
capable
of
find
such
various
phrase
to
express
the
same
thing
.
  
<EOS>
in
like
manner
I
apprehend
,
some
future
historian
(
if
any
one
shall
do
me
the
honour
of
imitate
my
manner
)
will
,
after
much
scratch
his
pate
,
bestow
some
good
wish
on
my
memory
,
for
have
first
establish
these
several
initial
chapter
;
most
of
which
,
like
modern
prologue
,
may
as
properly
be
prefix
to
any
other
book
in
this
history
as
to
that
which
they
introduce
,
or
indeed
to
any
other
history
as
to
this
.
  
<EOS>
but
however
author
may
suffer
by
either
of
these
invention
,
the
reader
will
find
sufficient
emolument
in
the
one
as
the
spectator
hath
long
find
in
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
first
,
it
be
well
known
that
the
prologue
serve
the
critic
for
an
opportunity
to
try
his
faculty
of
hiss
,
and
to
tune
his
cat
-
call
to
the
good
advantage
;
by
which
mean
,
I
have
know
those
musical
instrument
so
well
prepared
,
that
they
have
be
able
to
play
in
full
concert
at
the
first
rise
of
the
curtain
.
  
<EOS>
the
same
advantage
may
be
draw
from
these
chapter
,
in
which
the
critic
will
be
always
sure
of
meet
with
something
that
may
serve
as
a
whetstone
to
his
noble
spirit
;
so
that
he
may
fall
with
a
more
hungry
appetite
for
censure
on
the
history
itself
.
<EOS>
and
here
his
sagacity
must
make
it
needless
to
observe
how
artfully
these
chapter
be
calculate
for
that
excellent
purpose
;
for
in
these
we
have
always
take
care
to
intersperse
somewhat
of
the
sour
or
acid
kind
,
in
order
to
sharpen
and
stimulate
the
said
spirit
of
criticism
.
  
<EOS>
again
,
the
indolent
reader
,
as
well
as
spectator
,
find
great
advantage
from
both
these
;
for
,
as
they
be
not
oblige
either
to
see
the
one
or
read
the
other
,
and
both
the
play
and
the
book
be
thus
protract
,
by
the
former
they
have
a
quarter
of
an
hour
longer
allow
them
to
sit
at
dinner
,
and
by
the
latter
they
have
the
advantage
of
beginning
to
read
at
the
fourth
or
fifth
page
instead
of
the
first
,
a
matter
by
no
means
of
trivial
consequence
to
person
who
read
book
with
no
other
view
than
to
say
they
have
read
them
,
a
more
general
motive
to
read
than
be
commonly
imagine
;
and
from
which
not
only
law
book
,
and
good
book
,
but
the
page
of
Homer
and
Virgil
,
of
Swift
and
Cervantes
,
have
be
often
turn
over
.
  
<EOS>
many
other
be
the
emolument
which
arise
from
both
these
,
but
they
be
for
the
most
part
so
obvious
,
that
we
shall
not
at
present
stay
to
enumerate
them
;
especially
since
it
occur
to
us
that
the
principal
merit
of
both
the
prologue
and
the
preface
be
that
they
be
short
.
    
<EOS>
a
whimsical
adventure
which
befel
the
squire
,
with
the
distressed
situation
of
Sophia
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
now
convey
the
reader
to
Mr
Western
's
lodging
,
which
be
in
Piccadilly
,
where
he
be
place
by
the
recommendation
of
the
landlord
at
the
Hercules
Pillars
at
Hyde
Park
Corner
;
for
at
the
inn
,
which
be
the
first
he
see
on
his
arrival
in
town
,
he
place
his
horse
,
and
in
those
lodging
,
which
be
the
first
he
hear
of
,
he
deposit
himself
.
  
<EOS>
here
,
when
Sophia
alight
from
the
hackney
-
coach
,
which
bring
her
from
the
house
of
Lady
Bellaston
,
she
desire
to
retire
to
the
apartment
provide
for
her
;
to
which
her
father
very
readily
agree
,
and
whither
he
attend
her
himself
.
<EOS>
a
short
dialogue
,
neither
very
material
nor
pleasant
to
relate
minutely
,
then
pass
between
them
,
in
which
he
press
her
vehemently
to
give
her
consent
to
the
marriage
with
Blifil
,
who
,
as
he
acquaint
her
,
be
to
be
in
town
in
a
few
day
;
but
,
instead
of
comply
,
she
give
a
more
peremptory
and
resolute
refusal
than
she
have
ever
do
before
.
<EOS>
this
so
incense
her
father
,
that
after
many
bitter
vow
,
that
he
would
force
her
to
have
him
whether
she
would
or
no
,
he
depart
from
her
with
many
hard
word
and
curse
,
lock
the
door
,
and
put
the
key
into
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
while
Sophia
be
leave
with
no
other
company
than
what
attend
the
close
state
prisoner
,
namely
,
fire
and
candle
,
the
squire
sit
down
to
regale
himself
over
a
bottle
of
wine
,
with
his
parson
and
the
landlord
of
the
Hercules
Pillars
,
who
,
as
the
squire
say
,
would
make
an
excellent
third
man
,
and
could
inform
them
of
the
news
of
the
town
,
and
how
affair
go
;
for
to
be
sure
,
say
he
,
he
know
a
great
deal
,
since
the
horse
of
many
of
the
quality
stand
at
his
house
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
agreeable
society
<EOS>
Mr
Western
past
that
evening
and
great
part
of
the
succeed
day
,
during
which
period
nothing
happen
of
sufficient
consequence
to
find
a
place
in
this
history
.
<EOS>
all
this
time
Sophia
past
by
herself
;
for
her
father
swear
she
should
never
come
out
of
her
chamber
alive
,
unless
she
first
consent
to
marry
Blifil
;
nor
do
he
ever
suffer
the
door
to
be
unlocked
,
unless
to
convey
her
food
,
on
which
occasion
he
always
attend
himself
.
  
<EOS>
the
second
morning
after
his
arrival
,
while
he
and
the
parson
be
at
breakfast
together
on
a
toast
and
tankard
,
he
be
inform
that
a
gentleman
be
below
to
wait
on
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
gentleman
!
"
<EOS>
quoth
the
squire
,
"
who
the
devil
can
he
be
?
<EOS>
do
,
doctor
,
go
down
and
see
who
'
tis
.
<EOS>
Mr
Blifil
can
hardly
be
come
to
town
yet
.
 
<EOS>
go
down
,
do
,
and
know
what
his
business
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
doctor
return
with
an
account
that
it
be
a
very
well
-
dr
man
,
and
by
the
ribbon
in
his
hat
he
take
him
for
an
officer
of
the
army
;
that
he
say
he
have
some
particular
business
,
which
he
could
deliver
to
none
but
Mr
Western
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
an
officer
!
"
<EOS>
cry
the
squire
;
"
what
can
any
such
fellow
have
to
do
with
me
?
<EOS>
if
he
want
an
order
for
baggage
-
waggon
,
I
be
no
justice
of
peace
here
,
nor
can
I
grant
a
warrant
.
 
<EOS>
let
un
come
up
then
,
if
he
must
speak
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
very
genteel
man
now
enter
the
room
;
who
,
have
make
his
compliment
to
the
squire
,
and
desire
the
favour
of
be
alone
with
him
,
deliver
himself
as
follow
:
    
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
come
to
wait
upon
you
by
the
command
of
my
Lord
Fellamar
;
but
with
a
very
different
message
from
what
I
suppose
you
expect
,
after
what
past
the
other
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
who
?
"
cry
the
squire
;
"
I
never
hear
the
name
o'un
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
lordship
,
"
say
the
gentleman
,
"
be
willing
to
impute
everything
to
the
effect
of
liquor
,
and
the
most
trifling
acknowledgment
of
that
kind
will
set
everything
right
;
for
as
he
hath
the
most
violent
attachment
to
your
daughter
,
you
,
<EOS>
sir
,
be
the
last
person
upon
earth
from
whom
he
would
resent
an
affront
;
and
happy
be
it
for
you
both
that
he

public
demonstration
of
his
courage
as
to
be
able

put
up
an
affair
of
this
kind
without
danger
of
any

<EOS>
all

therefore

be

that
you

before
me
make
some
acknowledgment

the

in

be
sufficient

he
intend
this
afternoon
to
pay
his
respect
to
you

in

to
obtain
your
leave
of
visit
the

the

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
much
of
what
you
say
,
sir

"
say
the
squire

<EOS>
but
I
suppose
,
by
what
you
talk
about
my
daughter
,
that
this
be
the
lord
which
my
cousin
,
Lady
Bellaston
,
mention
to
me
,
and
say
something
about
his
court
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
if
so
be
that
how
that
be
the
case
 
you
may
give
my
service
to
his
lordship
,
and
tell
un
the

dispose
of
already

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
sir

"
say
the
gentleman
,
"
you
be
not
sufficiently
apprize
of

greatness
of

offer

<EOS>
I
believe
such
a
person

title
,
and
fortune
would
be
nowhere
refuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lookee
,
sir

"
answer
the
squire
;
"
to
be
very
plain
,
my
daughter
be
bespeak
already
;
but
if
she
be
not
,
I
would
not
marry
her
to
a
lord
upon
any
account
;
I
hate
all
lord
;
they
be
a
parcel
of
courtier
and
Hanoverians
,

I
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
them

"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir

"
say
the
gentleman
,
"
if
that
be
your
resolution

the
message
I
be
to
deliver
to
you
be
that
my

desire
the
favour
of
your
company
this
morning
in
Hyde
Park
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
tell
my

the

"
that
I
be
busy

can
not
come

I
have
enough
to
look
after
at

can
not
stir
abroad
on
any
account

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
sir

"
quoth
the
other
,
"
you
be
too
much
a
gentleman
to
send
such
a
message

;
you
will
not

I
be
convinced
,
have
it
say
of
you
,
that
,
after
have
affront
a
noble
peer

you
refuse
him
satisfaction

<EOS>
His
lordship
would
have
be
willing
,
from
his
great
regard
to
the
young
lady
,
to
have
make
up
matter
in
another
way
;
but
unless
he
be
to
look
on
you
as
a
father
,
his
honour
will
not
suffer
his
putting
up
such
an
indignity
as
you
must
be
sensible
you
offer
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
offer
him

the

it

<EOS>
upon
these
word
the
gentleman
return
a
very
short
verbal
rebuke
,

this
he
accompany
at
the

time
with
some
manual
remonstrance

which
no
sooner
reach
the

of
Mr

that
worthy
squire
begin
to
caper
very
briskly
about
the
room

bellow
at
the

time
with
all
his
might

a
great
number

<EOS>
the

with
some
indignation
,
reply
,
"
I
see

you

farewel
of
her
condemned
husband
;
or
rather
he
look
down
on
her
with
the
same
emotion
which
arise
in
an
honest
fair
tradesman
,
who
see
his
debtor
drag
to
prison
for
L10
,
which
,
though
a
just
debt
,
the
wretch
be
wickedly
unable
to
pay
.
<EOS>
or
,
to
hit
the
case
still
more
nearly
,
he
feel
the
same
compunction
with
a
bawd
,
when
some
poor
innocent
,
whom
she
hath
ensnare
into
her
hand
,
fall
into
fit
at
the
first
proposal
of
what
be
call
see
company
.
<EOS>
indeed
this
resemblance
would
be
exact
,
be
it
not
that
the
bawd
hath
an
interest
in
what
she
doth
,
and
the
father
,
though
perhaps
he
may
blindly
think
otherwise
,
can
,
in
reality
,
have
none
in
urge
his
daughter
to
almost
an
equal
prostitution
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
condition
he
leave
his
poor
Sophia
,
and
,
depart
with
a
very
vulgar
observation
on
the
effect
of
tear
,
he
lock
the
room
,
and
return
to
the
parson
,
who
say
everything
he
durst
in
behalf
of
the
young
lady
,
which
,
though
perhaps
it
be
not
quite
so
much
as
his
duty
require
,
yet
be
it
sufficient
to
throw
the
squire
into
a
violent
rage
,
and
into
many
indecent
reflection
on
the
whole
body
of
the
clergy
,
which
we
have
too
great
an
honour
for
that
sacred
function
to
commit
to
paper
.
    
<EOS>
what
happen
to
Sophia
during
her
confinement
.
 
<EOS>
the
landlady
of
the
house
where
the
squire
lodge
have
begin
very
early
to
entertain
a
strange
opinion
of
her
guest
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
she
be
inform
that
the
squire
be
a
man
of
vast
fortune
,
and
as
she
have
take
care
to
exact
a
very
extraordinary
price
for
her
room
,
she
do
not
think
proper
to
give
any
offence
;
for
,
though
she
be
not
without
some
concern
for
the
confinement
of
poor
Sophia
,
of
whose
great
sweetness
of
temper
and
affability
the
maid
of
the
house
have
make
so
favourable
a
report
,
which
be
confirm
by
all
the
squire
's
servant
,
yet
she
have
much
more
concern
for
her
own
interest
than
to
provoke
one
,
whom
,
as
she
say
,
she
perceive
to
be
a
very
hastish
kind
of
a
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
though
Sophia
eat
but
little
,
yet
she
be
regularly
serve
with
her
meal
;
indeed
,
I
believe
,
if
she
have
like
any
one
rarity
,
that
the
squire
,
however
angry
,
would
have
spare
neither
pain
nor
cost
to
have
procure
it
for
her
;
since
,
however
strange
it
may
appear
to
some
of
my
reader
,
he
really
doate
on
his
daughter
,
and
to
give
her
any
kind
of
pleasure
be
the
high
satisfaction
of
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
the
dinner
-
hour
being
arrive
,
Black
George
carry
her
up
a
pullet
,
the
squire
himself
(
for
he
have
swear
not
to
part
with
the
key
)
attend
the
door
.
<EOS>
as
George
deposit
the
dish
,
some
compliment
pass
between
him
and
Sophia
(
for
he
have
not
see
her
since
she
leave
the
country
,
and
she
treat
every
servant
with
more
respect
than
some
person
shew
to
those
who
be
in
a
very
slight
degree
their
inferior
)
.
<EOS>
Sophia
would
have
have
him
take
the
pullet
back
,
say
,
she
could
not
eat
;
but
George
beg
her
to
try
,
and
particularly
recommend
to
her
the
egg
,
of
which
he
say
it
be
full
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
time
the
squire
be
wait
at
the
door
;
but
George
be
a
great
favourite
with
his
master
,
as
his
employment
be
in
concern
of
the
high
nature
,
namely
,
about
the
game
,
and
be
accustomed
to
take
many
liberty
.
<EOS>
He
have
officiously
carry
up
the
dinner
,
be
,
as
he
say
,
very
desirous
to
see
his
young
lady
;
he
make
therefore
no
scruple
of
keep
his
master
stand
above
ten
minute
,
while
civility
be
pass
between
him
and
Sophia
,
for
which
he
receive
only
a
good
-
humoured
rebuke
at
the
door
when
he
return
.
  
<EOS>
the
egg
of
pullet
,
partridge
,
pheasant
,
&
c.
,
be
,
as
George
well
know
,
the
most
favourite
dainty
of
Sophia
.
<EOS>
It
be
therefore
no
wonder
that
he
,
who
be
a
very
good
-
natured
fellow
,
should
take
care
to
supply
her
with
this
kind
of
delicacy
,
at
a
time
when
all
the
servant
in
the
house
be
afraid
she
would
be
starve
;
for
she
have
scarce
swallow
a
single
morsel
in
the
last
forty
hour
.
  
<EOS>
though
vexation
hath
not
the
same
effect
on
all
person
as
it
usually
hath
on
a
widow
,
whose
appetite
it
often
render
sharp
than
it
can
be
render
by
the
air
on
Bansted
Downs
,
or
Salisbury
Plain
;
yet
the
sublime
grief
,
notwithstanding
what
some
people
may
say
to
the
contrary
,
will
eat
at
last
.
<EOS>
and
Sophia
,
herself
,
after
some
little
consideration
,
begin
to
dissect
the
fowl
,
which
she
find
to
be
as
full
of
egg
as
George
have
report
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
if
she
be
pleased
with
these
,
it
contain
something
which
would
have
delight
the
Royal
Society
much
more
;
for
if
a
fowl
with
three
leg
be
so
invaluable
a
curiosity
,
when
perhaps
time
hath
produce
a
thousand
such
,
at
what
price
<EOS>
shall
we
esteem
a
bird
which
so
totally
contradict
all
the
law
of
animal
oeconomy
,
as
to
contain
a
letter
in
its
belly
?
<EOS>
Ovid
tell
us
of
a
flower
into
which
Hyacinthus
be
metamorphose
,
that
bear
letter
on
its
leave
,
which
Virgil
recommend
as
a
miracle
to
the
Royal
Society
of
his
day
;
but
no
age
nor
nation
hath
ever
record
a
bird
with
a
letter
in
its
maw
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
a
miracle
of
this
kind
may
have
engage
all
the
Academies
des
Sciences
in
Europe
,
and
perhaps
in
a
fruitless
enquiry
;
yet
the
reader
,
by
barely
recollect
the
last
dialogue
which
pass
between
Messieurs
Jones
and
Partridge
,
will
be
very
easily
satisfied
from
whence
this
letter
come
,
and
how
it
find
its
passage
into
the
fowl
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
,
notwithstanding
her
long
fast
,
and
notwithstanding
her
favourite
dish
be
there
before
her
,
no
sooner
see
the
letter
than
she
immediately
snatch
it
up
,
tear
it
open
,
and
read
as
follow
:
      
"
MADAM
,
    
<EOS>
"
be
I
not
sensible
to
whom
I
have
the
honour
of
writing
,
I
should
  
endeavour
,
however
difficult
,
to
paint
the
horror
of
my
mind
at
the
  
account
bring
me
by
Mrs
Honour
;
but
as
tenderness
alone
can
have
  
any
true
idea
of
the
pang
which
tenderness
be
capable
of
feeling
,
  
<EOS>
so
can
this
most
amiable
quality
,
which
my
Sophia
possess
in
the
  
most
eminent
degree
,
sufficiently
inform
her
what
her
Jones
must
  
have
suffer
on
this
melancholy
occasion
.
<EOS>
be
there
a
circumstance
  
in
the
world
which
can
heighten
my
agony
,
when
I
hear
of
any
  
misfortune
which
hath
befall
you
?
<EOS>
surely
there
be
one
only
,
and
  
with
that
I
be
accurse
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
my
Sophia
,
the
dreadful
  
consideration
that
I
be
myself
the
wretched
cause
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
here
do
  
myself
too
much
honour
,
but
none
will
envy
me
an
honour
which
cost
  
me
so
extremely
dear
.
<EOS>
pardon
me
this
presumption
,
and
pardon
me
a
  
great
still
,
if
I
ask
you
,
whether
my
advice
,
my
assistance
,
my
  
presence
,
my
absence
,
my
death
,
or
my
torture
can
bring
you
any
  
relief

the
most
perfect
admiration

the
most
watchful
  
observance

the
most
ardent
love

the
most
melt
tenderness

the
  
most
resign
submission

your

make
you
amend
for
what
you
  
be

sacrifice
to
my
happiness

can

fly

my
lovely
angel

to
those
arm
which
be
ever
open

receive

which
,
whether
you
bring
yourself
alone
,
or
the
rich
of
the
world
  
with
you
,
be
,
in
my
opinion
,
an
alternative
not
worth

<EOS>
if
,
  
on
the
contrary
,
wisdom
shall
predominate
,
and
,
on
the
most
mature
  
reflection

inform
you

reconcile
your

restore
the
peace

by
abandon

you
drive
me
for
  
ever
from
your

exert
your
resolution

let
no
  
compassion

my

I
so
sincerely
love
you
better
than
  
myself

that
my
great

My

indulge
me

be

if
  
I

no

"
  
<EOS>
what
Sophia
say
,
or
do
,
or
think
,
upon
this
letter
,
how
often
she
read
it
,
or
whether
more
than
once
,
shall
all
be
leave
to
our
reader
's
imagination
.
<EOS>
the
answer
to
it
he
may
perhaps
see
hereafter
,
but
not
at
present
:
for
this
reason
,
among
other
,
that
she
do
not
now
write
any
,
and
that
for
several
good
cause
,
one
of
which
be
this
,
she
have
no
paper
,
pen
,
nor
ink
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
evening
,
while
Sophia
be
meditate
on
the
letter
she
have
receive
,
or
on
something
else
,
a
violent
noise
from
below
disturb
her
meditation
.
<EOS>
this
noise
be
no
other
than
a
round
bout
at
altercation
between
two
person
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
combatant
,
by
his
voice
,
she
immediately
distinguish
to
be
her
father
;
but
she
do
not
so
soon
discover
the
shriller
pipe
to
belong
to
the
organ
of
her
aunt
Western
,
who
be
just
arrive
in
town
,
where
have
,
by
mean
of
one
of
her
servant
,
who
stopt
at
the
Hercules
Pillars
,
learn
where
her
brother
lodge
,
she
drive
directly
to
his
lodging
.
  
<EOS>
We
shall
therefore
take
our
leave
at
present
of
Sophia
,
and
,
with
our
usual
good
-
breeding
,
attend
her
ladyship
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
Sophia
be
deliver
from
her
confinement

<EOS>
the
squire

the
parson
(
for
the

be
now
otherwise

be
smoake
their
pipe
together

when
the
arrival
of

be
first
signify
.
<EOS>
the
squire
no
sooner
hear
her
name
,
than
he
immediately
run
down
to
usher
her
upstairs
;
for
he
be
a
great
observer
of
such
ceremonial
,
especially
to
his
sister

of
whom
he
stand
more
in
awe

of
any

he
never

own
this

Mrs
Western

on
her
arrival
in
the
dining

room

have
fling
herself
into

I

be
the

it
not
by
these
headstrong

that
you
force
my

away

have
you
a
mind
to
oblige
her
to
take
such
another
step
?

the
devil

<EOS>
cry
the
squire

dash
his
pipe
on
the
ground
;
"
do
ever
mortal
<EOS>
hear
the
like

when
I
expect
you
would
have
commend
me
for
all
I
have
do

fall
upon

"
how

say
the

have
I
ever
give
you
the

what

You

odious

He
break
in
abruptly
upon
me
without
notice

I
would
not

<EOS>
He
run
on
a
long

unintelligible
story
about
his

force

to
give
him
a
hearing

I
make
him
very
little
answer

deliver
him
the
letter

answer

I
suppose
the

I

luckily

for
have
it
continue
much
long

fresh
matter
of
dissension
would

most
probably
,
have
arise
between
the
brother

between
whom
education
and
sex
make
the
only
difference

for
both
be
equally
violent

equally
positive

they
have
both
a
vast
affection
for
Sophia

both
a
sovereign
contempt
for
each
other

the

George
in
town

and
the
good
office
which
that
grateful
fellow
have
promise

do

greatly
comfort
Jones

anxiety

uneasiness
which
he
have
suffer
on
the
account
of

<EOS>
"
Sir

"
as
I
do
not
doubt
your
sincerity
in
what
you
write

you
will
be
  
pleased
to
hear
that
some
of
my
affliction
be
at
an
end
,
by
the
  
arrival
of
my
aunt
Western
,
with
whom
I
be
at
present
,
and
with
whom
  
I
enjoy
all
the
liberty
I
can
desire
.
<EOS>
one
promise
my
aunt
hath
  
insist
on
my
making
,
which
be
,
that
I
will
not
see
or
converse
  
with
any
person
without
her
knowledge
and
consent
.
<EOS>
this
promise
I
  
have
most
solemnly
give
,
and
shall
most
inviolably
keep
:
and
though
  
she
hath
not
expressly
forbid
me
write
,
yet
that
must
be
an
  
omission
from
forgetfulness
;
or
this
,
perhaps
,
be
include
in
the
  
word
conversing
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
I
can
not
but
consider
this
as
a
breach
  
of
her
generous
confidence
in
my
honour
,
you
can
not
expect
that
I
  
shall
,
after
this
,
continue
to
write
myself
or
to
receive
letter
,
  
without
her
knowledge
.
<EOS>
a
promise
be
with
me
a
very
sacred
thing
,
and
  
to
be
extend
to
everything
understand
from
it
,
as
well
as
to
what
  
be
express
by
it
;
and
this
consideration
may
,
perhaps
,
on
  
reflection
,
afford
you
some
comfort
.
<EOS>
but
why
should
I
mention
a
  
comfort
to
you
of
this
kind
;
for
though
there
be
one
thing
in
which
  
I
can
never
comply
with
the
good
of
father
,
yet
be
I
firmly
  
resolve
never
to
act
in
defiance
of
him
,
or
to
take
any
step
of
  
consequence
without
his
consent
.
<EOS>
a
firm
persuasion
of
this
must
  
teach
you
to
divert
your
thought
from
what
fortune
hath
(
perhaps
)
  
make
impossible

<EOS>
this
your
own
interest
persuade
you

<EOS>
this
may
  
reconcile
,
I
hope

Mr

to
you

it
will
,
you

my
  
injunction

pursue
it

accident
have
lay
some
obligation
on
  
me

and
your
good

probably
more
.
<EOS>
Fortune
may
,
perhaps
,
be
  
some
time
kinder
to
us
both
than
at
present
.
<EOS>
believe
this
,
that
I
  
shall
always
think
of
you

be

<EOS>
a

out

the

reader
may
probably
wonder
that
he
be
displeased
at
all
;
but
the
reader
be
not
quite
so
much
in
love
as
be
poor
Jones
;
and
love
be
a
disease
which
,
though
it
may
,
in
some
instance
,
resemble
a
consumption
(
which
it
sometimes
cause
)
,
in
other
proceed
in
direct
opposition
to
it
,
and
particularly
in
this
,
that
it
never
flatter
itself
,
or
see
any
one
symptom
in
a
favourable
light
.
  
<EOS>
one
thing
give
him
complete
satisfaction
,
which
be
,
that
his
mistress
have
regain
her
liberty
,
and
be
now
with
a
lady
where
she
may
at
least
assure
herself
of
a
decent
treatment
.
<EOS>
another
comfortable
circumstance
be
the
reference
which
she
make
to
her
promise
of
never
marry
any
other
man
;
for
however
disintereste
he
may
imagine
his
passion
,
and
notwithstanding
all
the
generous
overture
make
in
his
letter
,
I
very
much
question
whether
he
could
have
hear
a
more
afflict
piece
of
news
than
that
Sophia
be
marry
to
another
,
though
the
match
have
be
never
so
great
,
and
never
so
likely
to
end
in
make
her
completely
happy
.
<EOS>
that
refined
degree
of
platonic
affection
which
be
absolutely
detach
from
the
flesh
,
and
be
,
indeed
,
entirely
and
purely
spiritual
,
be
a
gift
confine
to
the
female
part
of
the
creation
;
many
of
whom
I
have
hear
declare
(
and
,
doubtless
,
with
great
truth
)
,
that
they
would
,
with
the
utmost
readiness
,
resign
a
lover
to
a
rival
,
when
such
resignation
be
prove
to
be
necessary
for
the
temporal
interest
of
such
lover
.
<EOS>
hence
,
therefore
,
I
conclude
that
this
affection
be
in
nature
,
though
I
can
not
pretend
to
say
I
have
ever
see
an
instance
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Jones
have
spend
three
hour
in
read
and
kiss
the
aforesaid
letter
,
and
be
,
at
last
,
in
a
state
of
good
spirit
,
from
the
last
-
mention
consideration
,
he
agree
to
carry
an
appointment
,
which
he
have
before
make
,
into
execution
.
<EOS>
this
be
,
to
attend
Mrs
Miller
,
and
her
young
daughter
,
into
the
gallery
at
the
play
-
house
,
and
to
admit
Mr
Partridge
as
one
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
for
as
Jones
have
really
that
taste
for
humour
which
many
affect
,
he
expect
to
enjoy
much
entertainment
in
the
criticism
of
Partridge
,
from
whom
he
expect
the
simple
dictate
of
nature
,
unimprove
,
indeed
,
but
likewise
unadulterated
,
by
art
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
row
then
of
the
first
gallery
do
Mr
Jones
,
Mrs
Miller
,
her
young
daughter
,
and
Partridge
,
take
their
place
.
<EOS>
partridge
immediately
declare
it
be
the
fine
place
he
have
ever
be
in
.
<EOS>
when
the
first
music
be
play
,
he
say
,
"
It
be
a
wonder
how
so
many
fiddler
could
play
at
one
time
,
without
put
one
another
out
.
"
<EOS>
while
the
fellow
be
light
the
upper
candle
,
he
cry
out
to
Mrs
Miller
,
"
look
,
look
,
madam
,
the
very
picture
of
the
man
in
the
end
of
the
common
-
prayer
book
before
the
gunpowder
-
treason
service
.
"
<EOS>
nor
could
he
help
observe
,
with
a
sigh
,
when
all
the
candle
be
light
,
"
that
here
be
candle
enough
burn
in
one
night
,
to
keep
an
honest
poor
family
for
a
whole
twelvemonth
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
play
,
which
be
Hamlet
,
Prince
of
Denmark
,
begin
,
Partridge
be
all
attention
,
nor
do
he
break
silence
till
the
entrance
of
the
ghost
;
upon
which
he
ask
Jones
,
"
what
man
that
be
in
the
strange
dress
;
something
,
"
say
he
,
"
like
what
I
have
see
in
a
picture
.
<EOS>
sure
it
be
not
armour
,
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
Jones
answer
,
"
that
be
the
ghost
.
"
<EOS>
to
which
Partridge
reply
with
a
smile
,
"
persuade
me
to
that
,
sir
,
if
you
can
.
<EOS>
though
I
can
not
say
I
ever
actually
see
a
ghost
in
my
life
,
yet
I
be
certain
I
should
know
one
,
if
I
see
him
,
well
than
that
come
to
.
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
sir
,
ghost
do
not
appear
in
such
dress
as
that
,
neither
.
<EOS>
"
in
this
mistake
,
which
cause
much
laughter
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Partridge
,
he
be
suffer
to
continue
,
till
the
scene
between
the
ghost
and
Hamlet
,
when
Partridge
give
that
credit
to
Mr
Garrick
,
which
he
have
deny
to
Jones
,
and
fall
into
so
violent
a
trembling
,
that
his
knee
knock
against
each
other
.
<EOS>
Jones
ask
him
what
be
the
matter
,
and
whether
he
be
afraid
of
the
warrior
upon
the
stage
?
"
<EOS>
o
la
!
<EOS>
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
perceive
now
<EOS>
it
be
what
you
tell
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
afraid
of
anything
;
for
I
know
it
be
but
a
play
.
<EOS>
and
if
it
be
really
a
ghost
,
it
could
do
one
no
harm
at
such
a
distance
,
and
in
so
much
company
;
and
yet
if
I
be
frightened
,
I
be
not
the
only
person
.
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
who
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
dost
thou
take
to
be
such
a
coward
here
besides
thyself
?
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
you
may
call
me
coward
if
you
will
;
but
if
that
little
man
there
upon
the
stage
be
not
frightened
,
I
never
see
any
man
frightened
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
ay
,
ay
:
go
along
with
you
:
<EOS>
ay
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
who
be
fool
then
?
<EOS>
Will
you
?
<EOS>
Lud
have
mercy
upon
such
fool
-
hardiness
!
 
<EOS>
whatever
happen
,
it
be
good
enough
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
follow
you
?
<EOS>
I
would
follow
the
devil
as
soon
.
<EOS>
nay
,
perhaps
it
be
the
devil
 
<EOS>
for
they
say
he
can
put
on
what
likeness
he
please
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
here
he
be
again
.
 
<EOS>
no
farther
!
<EOS>
no
,
you
have
go
far
enough
already
;
farther
than
I
would
have
go
for
all
the
king
's
dominion
.
"
<EOS>
Jones
offer
to
speak
,
but
Partridge
cry
"
hush
,
hush
!
<EOS>
dear
sir
,
do
not
you
hear
him
?
"
<EOS>
and
during
the
whole
speech
of
the
ghost
,
he
sit
with
his
eye
fix
partly
on
the
ghost
and
partly
on
Hamlet
,
and
with
his
mouth
open
;
the
same
passion
which
succeed
each
other
in
Hamlet
,
succeed
likewise
in
him
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
scene
be
over
Jones
say
,
"
why
,
Partridge
,
you
exceed
my
expectation
.
<EOS>
You
enjoy
the
play
more
than
I
conceive
possible
.
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
sir
,
"
answer
Partridge
,
"
if
you
be
not
afraid
of
the
devil
,
I
can
not
help
it
;
but
to
be
sure
,
it
be
natural
to
be
surprize
at
such
thing
,
though
I
know
there
be
nothing
in
them
:
<EOS>
not
that
it
be
the
ghost
that
surprize
me
,
neither
;
for
I
should
have
know
that
to
have
be
only
a
man
in
a
strange
dress
;
but
when
I
see
the
little
man
so
frighten
himself
,
it
be
that
which
take
hold
of
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
and
dost
thou
imagine
,
then
,
Partridge
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
that
he
be
really
frightened
?
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
sir
,
"
say
Partridge
,
"
do
not
you
yourself
observe
afterwards
,
when
he
find
it
be
his
own
father
's
spirit
,
and
how
he
be
murder
in
the
garden
,
how
his
fear
forsook
him
by
degree
,
and
he
be
strike
dumb
with
sorrow
,
as
it
be
,
just
as
I
should
have
be
,
have
it
be
my
own
case
?
 
<EOS>
but
hush
!
<EOS>
o
la
!
<EOS>
what
noise
be
that
?
<EOS>
there
he
be
again
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
to
be
certain
,
though
I
know
there
be
nothing
at
all
in
it
,
I
be
glad
I
be
not
down
yonder
,
where
those
man
be
.
"
<EOS>
then
turn
his
eye
again
upon
Hamlet
,
"
ay
,
you
may
draw
your
sword
;
what
signify
a
sword
against
the
power
of
the
devil
?
"
  
<EOS>
during
the
second
act
,
Partridge
make
very
few
remark
.
<EOS>
He
greatly
admire
the
fineness
of
the
dress
;
nor
could
he
help
observe
upon
the
king
's
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
how
people
may
be
deceive
by
face
!
<EOS>
Nulla
fide
<EOS>
fronti
be
,
I
find
,
a
true
saying
.
<EOS>
who
would
think
,
by
look
in
the
king
's
face
,
that
he
have
ever
commit
a
murder
?
"
<EOS>
He
then
enquire
after
the
ghost
;
but
Jones
,
who
intend
he
should
be
surprize
,
give
him
no
other
satisfaction
,
than
,
"
that
he
may
possibly
see
him
again
soon
,
and
in
a
flash
of
fire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Partridge
sit
in
a
fearful
expectation
of
this
;
and
now
,
when
the
ghost
make
his
next
appearance
,
Partridge
cry
out
,
"
<EOS>
there
,
sir
,
now
<EOS>
;
what
say
you
now
?
<EOS>
be
he
frighten
now
or
no
?
<EOS>
as
much
frightened
as
you
think
me
,
and
,
to
be
sure
,
nobody
can
help
some
fear
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
be
in
so
bad
a
condition
as
what
be
his
name
,
squire
Hamlet
,
be
there
,
for
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
bless
me
!
<EOS>
what
be
become
of
the
spirit
?
<EOS>
as
I
be
a
live
soul
,
I
think
I
see
him
sink
into
the
earth
.
"
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
you
see
right
,
"
answer
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
well
,
"
cry
Partridge
,
"
<EOS>
I
know
it
be
only
a
play
:
and
besides
,
if
there
be
anything
in
all
this
,
Madam
Miller
would
not
laugh
so
;
for
as
to
you
,
sir
,
you
would
not
be
afraid
,
I
believe
,
if
the
devil
be
here
in
person

<EOS>
there
,
there
 
ay
,
no
wonder
you
be
in
such
a
passion
,
shake
the
vile
wicked
wretch
to
piece
.
<EOS>
if
she
be
my
own
mother
,
I
would
serve
her
so
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
all
duty
to
a
mother
be
forfeit
by
such
wicked
doing
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
go
about
your
business
,
I
hate
the
sight
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Our
critic
be
now
pretty
silent
till
the
play
,
which
Hamlet
introduce
before
the
king
.
<EOS>
this
he
do
not
at
first
understand
,
till
Jones
explain
it
to
him
;
but
he
no
sooner
enter
into
the
spirit
of
it
,
than
he
begin
to
bless
himself
that
he
have
never
commit
murder
.
<EOS>
then
turn
to
Mrs
Miller
,
he
ask
her
,
"
if
she
do
not
imagine
the
king
look
as
if
he
be
touch
;
though
he
be
,
"
say
he
,
"
a
good
actor
,
and
doth
all
he
can
to
hide
it
.
<EOS>
well
,
I
would
not
have
so
much
to
answer
for
,
as
that
wicked
man
there
hath
,
to
sit
upon
a
much
high
chair
than
he
sit
upon
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
he
run
away
;
for
your
sake
I
will
never
trust
an
innocent
face
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
grave
-
dig
scene
next
engage
the
attention
of
Partridge
,
who
express
much
surprize
at
the
number
of
skull
throw
upon
the
stage
.
<EOS>
to
which
Jones
answer
,
"
that
it
be
one
of
the
most
famous
burial
-
place
about
town
.
"
<EOS>
"
no
wonder
then
,
"
cry
Partridge
,
"
that
the
place
be
haunt
.
<EOS>
but
I
never
see
in
my
life
a
bad
grave
-
digger
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
sexton
,
when
I
be
clerk
,
that
should
have
dig
three
grave
while
he
be
dig
one
.
<EOS>
the
fellow
handle
a
spade
as
if
it
be
the
first
time
he
have
ever
have
one
in
his
hand

ay
,
you
may
sing

<EOS>
You
have
rather
sing
than
work
,
I
believe

"
 
<EOS>
upon
Hamlet
's
take
up
the
skull
,
he
cry
out
,
"
well
!
<EOS>
it
be
strange
to
see
how
fearless

I
never

anything

a
dead
man

He
seem
frightened

<EOS>
little
more
worth
remembering
occur
during
the
play
,
at
the
end
of
which
Jones
ask
him
,
"
which
of
the
player
he
have
like
best
?
<EOS>
"
to
this
he
answer
,
with
some
appearance
of
indignation
at
the
question
,
"
<EOS>
the
king

without
doubt
.
"
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
Mr
Partridge
,
"
say
Mrs
Miller
,
"
you
be
not
of
the
same
opinion
with
the
town
;
for
they
be
all
agree
,
that
Hamlet
be
act
by
the
good
player
who
ever
be
on
the
stage

"
<EOS>
"
He
the
good
player
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Partridge
,
with
a
contemptuous
sneer
,
"
why
,
I
could
act
as
well
as
he
myself
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
if
I
have
see
a
ghost
,
I
should
have
look
in
the
very
same
manner
,
and
do
just
as
he
do
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
to
be
sure
,
in
that
scene
,
as
you
call
it
,
between
him
and
his
mother
,
where
you
tell
me
he
act
so
fine

why
,
Lord
help
me
,
any
man
,
that
is
,
any
good
man
,
that
have
such
a
mother
,
would
have
do
exactly
the
same
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
be
only
joke
with
me
;
but
indeed
,
madam
,
though
I
be
never
at
a
play
in
London
,
yet
I
have
see
act
before
in
the
country
;
and
the
king
for
my
money
;
he
speak
all
his
word
distinctly
,
half
as
loud
again
as
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
anybody
may
see
he
be
an
actor

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
while
Mrs
Miller
be
thus
engage
in
conversation
with
Partridge
,
a
lady
come
up
to
Mr
Jones
,
whom
he
immediately
know
to
be
Mrs
Fitzpatrick

<EOS>
She
say
,
she
have
see
him
from
the
other
part
of
the
gallery
,
and
have
take
that
opportunity
of
speak
to
him
,
as
she
have
something
to
say
,
which
may
be
of
great
service
to
himself
.
<EOS>
She
then
acquaint
him
with
her
lodging
,
and
make
him
an
appointment
the
next
day
in
the
morning
;
which
,
upon
recollection
,
she
presently
change
to
the
afternoon
;
at
which
time
Jones
promise
to
attend
her
.
  
<EOS>
thus
end
the
adventure
at
the
playhouse
;
where
Partridge
have
afford
great
mirth
,
not
only
to
Jones
and
Mrs
Miller
,
but
to
all
who
sit
within
hearing
,
who
be
more
attentive
to
what
he
say
,
than
to
anything
that
pass
on
the
stage
.
  
<EOS>
He
durst
not
go
to
bed
all
that
night
,
for
fear
of
the
ghost
;
and
for
many
night
after
sweat
two
or
three
hour
before
he
go
to
sleep
,
with
the
same
apprehension
,
and
wake
several
time
in
great
horror
,
cry
out
,
"
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
!
<EOS>
there
it
be
.
"
    
<EOS>
in
which
the
history
be
oblige
to
look
back
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
almost
impossible
for
the
good
parent
to
observe
an
exact
impartiality
to
his
child
,
even
though
no
superior
merit
should
bias
his
affection
;
but
sure
a
parent
can
hardly
be
blame
,
when
that
superiority
determine
his
preference
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
regard
all
the
personage
of
this
history
in
the
light
of
my
child
;
so
I
must
confess
the
same
inclination
of
partiality
to
Sophia
;
and
for
that
I
hope
the
reader
will
allow
me
the
same
excuse
,
from
the
superiority
of
her
character
.
  
<EOS>
this
extraordinary
tenderness
which
I
have
for
my
heroine
never
suffer
me
to
quit
her
any
long
time
without
the
utmost
reluctance
.
<EOS>
I
could
now
,
therefore
,
return
impatiently
to
enquire
what
hath
happen
to
this
lovely
creature
since
her
departure
from
her
father
's
,
but
that
I
be
oblige
first
to
pay
a
short
visit
to
Mr
Blifil
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Western
,
in
the
first
confusion
into
which
his
mind
be
cast
upon
the
sudden
news
he
receive
of
his
daughter
,
and
in
the
first
hurry
to
go
after
her
,
have
not
once
think
of
send
any
account
of
the
discovery
to
Blifil
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
go
far
,
however
,
before
he
recollect
himself
,
and
accordingly
stopt
at
the
very
first
inn
<EOS>
he
come
to
,
and
dispatch
away
a
messenger
to
acquaint
Blifil
with
his
have
find
Sophia
,
and
with
his
firm
resolution
to
marry
her
to
him
immediately
,
if
he
would
come
up
after
him
to
town
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
love
which
Blifil
have
for
Sophia
be
of
that
violent
kind
,
which
nothing
but
the
loss
of
her
fortune
,
or
some
such
accident
,
could
lessen
,
his
inclination
to
the
match
be
not
at
all
alter
by
her
have
run
away
,
though
he
be
oblige
to
lay
this
to
his
own
account
.
<EOS>
He
very
readily
,
therefore
,
embrace
this
offer
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
now
propose
the
gratification
of
a
very
strong
passion
besides
avarice
,
by
marry
this
young
lady
,
and
this
be
hatred
;
for
he
conclude
that
matrimony
afford
an
equal
opportunity
of
satisfy
either
hatred
or
love
;
and
this
opinion
be
very
probably
verify
by
much
experience
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
if
we
be
to
judge
by
the
ordinary
behaviour
of
married
person
to
each
other
,
we
shall
perhaps
be
apt
to
conclude
that
the
generality
seek
the
indulgence
of
the
former
passion
only
,
in
their
union
of
everything
but
of
heart
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
one
difficulty
,
however
,
in
his
way
,
and
this
arise
from
Mr
Allworthy
.
<EOS>
that
good
man
,
when
he
find
by
the
departure
of
Sophia
(
for
neither
that
,
nor
the
cause
of
it
,
could
be
conceal
from
him
)
,
the
great
aversion
which
she
have
for
his
nephew
,
begin
to
be
seriously
concerned
that
he
have
be
deceive
into
carry
matter
so
far
.
<EOS>
He
by
no
mean
concur
with
the
opinion
of
those
parent
,
who
think
it
as
immaterial
to
consult
the
inclination
of
their
child
in
the
affair
of
marriage
,
as
to
solicit
the
good
pleasure
of
their
servant
when
they
intend
to
take
a
journey
;
and
who
be
by
law
,
or
decency
at
least
,
withhold
often
from
use
absolute
force
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
as
he
esteem
the
institution
to
be
of
the
most
sacred
kind
,
he
think
every
preparatory
caution
necessary
to
preserve
it
holy
and
inviolate
;
and
very
wisely
conclude
,
that
the
sure
way
to
effect
this
be
by
lay
the
foundation
in
previous
affection
.
  
<EOS>
Blifil
indeed
soon
cure
his
uncle
of
all
anger
on
the
score
of
deceit
,
by
many
vow
and
protestation
that
he
have
be
deceive
himself
,
with
which
the
many
declaration
of
western
very
well
tallied
;
but
now
to
persuade
Allworthy
to
consent
to
the
renew
<EOS>
his
address
be
a
matter
of
such
apparent
difficulty
,
that
the
very
appearance
be
sufficient
to
have
deter
a
less
enterprizing
genius
;
but
this
young
gentleman
so
well
know
his
own
talent
,
that
nothing
within
the
province
of
cunning
seem
to
him
hard
to
be
achieve
.
  
<EOS>
here
then
he
represent
the
violence
of
his
own
affection
,
and
the
hope
of
subdue
aversion
in
the
lady
by
perseverance
.
<EOS>
He
beg
that
,
in
an
affair
on
which
depend
all
his
future
repose
,
he
may
at
least
be
at
liberty
to
try
all
fair
mean
for
success
.
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
,
he
say
,
that
he
should
ever
think
of
prevail
by
any
other
than
the
most
gentle
method
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
besides
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
if
they
fail
,
you
may
then
(
which
will
be
surely
time
enough
)
deny
your
consent
.
"
<EOS>
He
urge
the
great
and
eager
desire
which
Mr
Western
have
for
the
match
;
and
lastly
,
he
make
great
use
of
the
name
of
Jones
,
to
whom
he
impute
all
that
have
happen
;
and
from
whom
,
he
say
,
to
preserve
so
valuable
a
young
lady
be
even
an
act
of
charity
.
  
<EOS>
all
these
argument
be
well
second
by
Thwackum
,
who
dwelt
a
little
strong
on
the
authority
of
parent
than
Mr
Blifil
himself
have
do
.
<EOS>
He
ascribe
the
measure
which
Mr
Blifil
be
desirous
to
take
to
christian
motive
;
"
and
though
,
"
say
he
,
"
the
good
young
gentleman
hath
mention
charity
last
<EOS>
,
I
be
almost
convinced
it
be
his
first
and
principal
consideration
.
"
  
<EOS>
Square
,
possibly
,
have
he
be
present
,
would
have
sing
to
the
same
tune
,
though
in
a
different
key
,
and
would
have
discover
much
moral
fitness
in
the
proceeding
:
but
he
be
now
go
to
Bath
for
the
recovery
of
his
health
.
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
,
though
not
without
reluctance
,
at
last
yield
to
the
desire
of
his
nephew
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
would
accompany
him
to
London
,
where
he
may
be
at
liberty
to
use
every
honest
endeavour
to
gain
the
lady
:
"
but
I
declare
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
will
never
give
my
consent
to
any
absolute
force
be
put
on
her
inclination
,
nor
shall
you
ever
have
her
,
unless
she
can
be
bring
freely
to
compliance
.
"
  
<EOS>
thus
do
the
affection
of
Allworthy
for
his
nephew
betray
the
superior
understanding
to
be
triumph
over
by
the
inferior
;
and
thus
be
the
prudence
of
the
good
of
head
often
defeat
by
the
tenderness
of
the
good
of
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Blifil
,
have
obtain
this
unhoped
-
for
acquiescence
in
his
uncle
,
rest
not
till
he
carry
his
purpose
into
execution
.
<EOS>
and
as
no
immediate
business
require
Mr
Allworthy
's
presence
in
the
country
,
and
little
preparation
be
necessary
to
man
for
a
journey
,
they
set
out
the
very
next
day
,
and
arrive
in
town
that
evening
,
when
Mr
Jones
,
as
we
have
see
,
be
divert
himself
with
Partridge
at
the
play
.
  
<EOS>
the
morning
after
his
arrival
Mr
Blifil
wait
on
Mr
Western
,
by
whom
he
be
most
kindly
and
graciously
receive
,
and
from
whom
he
have
every
possible
assurance
(
perhaps
more
than
be
possible
)
that
he
should
very
shortly
be
as
happy
as
Sophia
could
make
him
;
nor
would
the
squire
suffer
the
young
gentleman
to
return
to
his
uncle
till
he
have
,
almost
against
his
will
,
carry
him
to
his
sister
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
Mr
Western
pay
a
visit
to
his
sister
,
in
company
with
Mr
Blifil
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Western
be
read
a
lecture
on
prudence
,
and
matrimonial
politic
,
to
her
niece
,
when
her
brother
and
Blifil
break
in
with
less
ceremony
than
the
law
of
visit
require
.
<EOS>
Sophia
no
sooner
see
Blifil
than
she
turn
pale
,
and
almost
lose
the
use
of
all
her
faculty
;
but
her
aunt
,
on
the
contrary
,
wax
red
,
and
,
have
all
her
faculty
at
command
,
begin
to
exert
her
tongue
on
the
squire
.
  
<EOS>
"
Brother
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
be
astonish
at
your
behaviour
;
will
you
never
learn
any
regard

decorum

<EOS>
Will
you
still
look
upon
every
apartment
as
your
own
,
or
as
belong
to
one
of
your
country
tenant
?
<EOS>
do
you
think
yourself
at

to
invade
the
privacy
of
woman
of
condition

without
the

notice

<EOS>

why

the

quoth
the

You

surprize
my

Go

my

retire

recruit
your
spirit

I
see
you
have
occasion

at
which
word
Sophia
,
who
never
receive
a
more
welcome
command
,
hastily

the

disagreeable
a

<EOS>
for
my
own
part

I
be
sure
I
shall
always
be
very
glad

his

it

sir
,
to
misfortune
,
"
answer
Blifil
;
<EOS>
"
but
I
shall
always
own
my
obligation
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
take
a
ceremonious
leave
of
Mrs
Western
,
who
be
altogether
as
ceremonious
on
her
part
;
and
then
they
depart
,
<EOS>
the
squire
muttering
to
himself
with
an
oath
,
that
Blifil
should
see
his
daughter
in
the
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
if
Mr
Western
be
little
pleased
with
this
interview
,
Blifil
be
less
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
former
,
he
impute
the
whole
behaviour
of
his
sister
to
her
humour
only
,
and
to
her
dissatisfaction
at
the
omission
of
ceremony
in
the
visit
;
but
Blifil
see
a
little
deep
into
thing
.
<EOS>
He
suspect
somewhat
of
more
consequence
,
from
two
or
three
word
which
dropt
from
the
lady
;
and
,
to
say
the
truth
,
he
suspect
right
,
as
will
appear
when
I
have
unfold
the
several
matter
which
will
be
contain
in
the
following
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
Schemes
of
Lady
Bellaston
for
the
ruin
of
Jones
.
 
<EOS>
Love
have
take
too
deep
a
root
in
the
mind
of
Lord
Fellamar
to
be
pluck
up
by
the
rude
hand
of
Mr
Western
.
<EOS>
in
the
heat
of
resentment
he
have
,
indeed
,
give
a
commission
to
Captain
Egglane
,
which
the
captain
have
far
exceed
in
the
execution
;
nor
have
it
be
execute
at
all
,
<EOS>
have
his
lordship
be
able
to
find
the
captain
after
he
have
see
Lady
Bellaston
,
which
be
in
the
afternoon
of
the
day
after
he
have
receive
the
affront
;
but
so
industrious
be
the
captain
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
,
that
,
have
after
long
enquiry
find
out
the
squire
's
lodging
very
late
in
the
evening
,
he
sit
up
all
night
at
a
tavern
,
that
he
may
not
miss
the
squire
in
the
morning
,
and
by
that
mean
miss
the
revocation
which
my
lord
have
send
to
his
lodging
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
then
next
after
the
intended
rape
of
Sophia
,
his
lordship
,
as
we
have
say
,
make
a
visit
to
Lady
Bellaston
,
who
lay
open
so
much
of
the
character
of
the
squire
,
that
his
lordship
plainly
see
the
absurdity
he
have
be
guilty
of
in
take
any
offence
at
his
word
,
especially
as
he
have
those
honourable
design
on
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
He
then
unbosom
the
violence
of
his
passion
to
Lady
Bellaston
,
who
readily
undertake
the
cause
,
and
encourage
him
with
certain
assurance
of
a
most
favourable
reception
from
all
the
elder
of
the
family
,
and
from
the
father
himself
when
he
should
be
sober
,
and
should
be
make
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
the
offer
make
to
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
the
only
danger
,
she
say
,
lie
in
the
fellow
she
have
formerly
mention
,
who
,
though
a
beggar
and
a
vagabond
,
have
,
by
some
mean
or
other
,
she
know
not
what
,
procure
himself
tolerable
cloath
,
and
past
for
a
gentleman
.
"
<EOS>
now
,
"
say
she
,
"
as
I
have
,
for
the
sake
of
my
cousin
,
make
it
my
business
to
enquire
after
this
fellow
,
I
have
luckily
find
out
his
lodging
;
"
with
which
she
then
acquaint
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
think
,
my
lord
,
"
add
she
"
(
for
this
fellow
be
too
mean
for
your
personal
resentment
)
,
whether
it
would
not
be
possible
for
your
lordship
to
contrive
some
method
of
have
him
press
and
send
on
board
a
ship
.
<EOS>
neither
law
nor
conscience
forbid
this
project
:
for
the
fellow
,
I
promise
you
,
however
well
dr
,
be
but
a
vagabond
,
and
as
proper
as
any
fellow
in
the
street
to
be
press
into
the
service
;
and
as
for
the
conscientious
part
,
surely
the
preservation
of
a
young
lady
from
such
ruin
be
a
most
meritorious
act
;
<EOS>
nay
,
with
regard
to
the
fellow
himself
,
unless
he
could
succeed
(
which
Heaven
forbid
)
with
my
cousin
,
it
may
probably
be
the
mean
of
preserve
him
from
the
gallow
,
and
perhaps
may
make
his
fortune
in
an
honest
way
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fellamar
very
heartily
thank
her
ladyship
for
the
part
which
she
be
pleased
to
take
in
the
affair
,
upon
the
success
of
which
his
whole
future
happiness
entirely
depend
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
he
see
at
present
no
objection
to
the
press
scheme
,
and
would
consider
of
put
it
in
execution
.
<EOS>
He
then
most
earnestly
recommend
to
her
ladyship
to
do
him
the
honour
of
immediately
mention
his
proposal
to
the
family
;
to
whom
he
say
he
offer
a
carte
blanche
,
and
would
settle
his
fortune
in
almost
any
manner
they
should
require
.
<EOS>
and
after
utter
many
ecstasy
and
rapture
concern
Sophia
,
he
take
his
leave
and
depart
,
but
not
before
he
have
receive
the
strong
charge
to
beware
of
Jones
,
and
to
lose
no
time
in
secure
his
person
,
where
he
should
no
longer
be
in
a
capacity
of
make
any
attempt
to
the
ruin
of
the
young
lady
.
  
<EOS>
the
moment
Mrs
Western
be
arrive
at
her
lodging
,
a
card
be
despatch
with
her
compliment
to
Lady
Bellaston
;
who
no
sooner
receive
it
than
,
with
the
impatience
of
a
lover
,
she
fly
to
her
cousin
,
rejoice
at
this
fair
opportunity
,
which
beyond
her
hope
offer
itself
,
for
she
be
much
better
pleased
with
the
prospect
of
make
the
proposal
to
a
woman
of
sense
,
and
who
know
the
world
,
than
to
a
gentleman
whom
she
honour
with
the
appellation
of
Hottentot
;
though
,
indeed
,
from
him
she
apprehend
no
danger
of
a
refusal
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
lady
be
meet
,
after
very
short
previous
ceremonial
,
fall
to
business
,
which
be
indeed
almost
as
soon
conclude
as
begin
;
for
Mrs
Western
no
sooner
hear
the
name
of
Lord
Fellamar
than
her
cheek
glow
with
pleasure
;
but
when
she
be
acquaint
with
the
eagerness
of
his
passion
,
the
earnestness
of
his
proposal
,
and
the
generosity
of
his
offer
,
she
declare
her
full
satisfaction
in
the
most
explicit
term
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
progress
of
their
conversation
their
discourse
turn
to
Jones
,
and
both
cousin
very
pathetically
lament
the
unfortunate
attachment
which
both
agree
Sophia
have
to
that
young
fellow
;
and
Mrs
Western
entirely
attribute
it
to
the
folly
of
her
brother
's
management
.
<EOS>
She
conclude
,
however
,
at
last
,
with
declare
her
confidence
in
the
good
understanding
of
her
niece
,
who
,
though
she
would
not
give
up
her
affection
in
favour
of
Blifil
,
will
,
I
doubt
not
,
say
she
,
soon
be
prevail
upon
to
sacrifice
a
simple
inclination
to
the
address
of
a
fine
gentleman
,
who
bring
her
both
a
title
and
a
large
estate
:
"
for
,
indeed
,
"
add
she
,
"
I
must
do
Sophy
the
justice
to
confess
this
Blifil
be
but
a
hideous
kind
of
fellow
,
as
you
know
,
Bellaston
,
all
country
gentleman
be
,
and
hath
nothing
but
his
fortune
to
recommend
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
Lady
Bellaston
,
"
<EOS>
I
do
not
then
so
much
wonder
at
my
cousin
;
for
I
promise
you
this
Jones
be
a
very
agreeable
fellow
,
and
hath
one
virtue
,
which
the
man
say
be
a
great
recommendation
to
us
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
,
<EOS>
Mrs
Western
 
<EOS>
I
shall
certainly
make
you
laugh
;
nay
,
I
can
hardly
tell
you
myself
for
laugh
 
<EOS>
will
you
believe
that
the
fellow
hath
have
the
assurance
to
make
love
to
me
?
<EOS>
but
if
you
should
be
incline
to
disbelieve
it
,
here
be
evidence
enough
,
his
own
handwriting
,
I
assure
you
.
"
<EOS>
She
then
deliver
her
cousin
the
letter
with
the
proposal
of
marriage
,
which
,
if
the
reader
hath
a
desire
to
see
,
he
will
find
already
on
record
in
the
XVth
book
of
this
history
.
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
I
be
astonish
,
"
say
Mrs
Western
;
"
this
be
,
indeed
,
a
masterpiece
of
assurance
.
<EOS>
with
your
leave
I
may
possibly
make
some
use
of
this
letter
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
have
my
full
liberty
,
"
cry
Lady
Bellaston
,
"
to
apply
it
to
what
purpose
you
please
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
would
not
have
it
shew
to
any
but
Miss
Western
,
nor
to
her
unless
you
find
occasion
.
"
<EOS>
"
well
,
and
how
do
you
use
the
fellow
?
"
return
Mrs
Western
.
<EOS>
"
not
as
a
husband
,
"
say
the
lady
;
"
I
be
not
married
,
I
promise
you
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
Bell
,
I
have
try
the
comfort
once
already
;
and
once
,
I
think
,
be
enough
for
any
reasonable
woman
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
letter
Lady
Bellaston
think
would
certainly
turn
the
balance
against
Jones
in
the
mind
of
Sophia
,
and
she
be
embolden
to
give
it
up
,
partly
by
her
hope
of
have
him
instantly
dispatch
out
of
the
way
,
and
partly
by
have
secure
the
evidence
of
Honour
,
who
,
upon
sound
her
,
she
see
sufficient
reason
to
imagine
be
prepared
to
testify
whatever
she
please
.
  
<EOS>
but
perhaps
the
reader
may
wonder
why
Lady
Bellaston
,
who
in
her
heart
hate
Sophia
,
should
be
so
desirous
of
promote
a
match
which
be
so
much
to
the
interest
of
the
young
lady
.
<EOS>
now
,
I
would
desire
such
reader
to
look
carefully
into
human
nature
,
page
almost
the
last
,
and
there
he
will
find
,
in
scarce
legible
character
,
that
woman
,
notwithstanding
the
preposterous
behaviour
of
mother
,
aunt
,
&
c.
,
in
matrimonial
matter
,
do
in
reality
think
it
so
great
a
misfortune
to
have
their
inclination
in
love
thwart
,
that
they
imagine
they
ought
never
to
carry
enmity
higher
than
upon
these
disappointment
;
again
,
he
will
find
it
write
much
about
the
same
place
,
that
a
woman
who
hath
once
be
pleased
with
the
possession
of
a
man
,
will
go
above
halfway
to
the
devil
,
to
prevent
any
other
woman
from
enjoy
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
if
he
will
not
be
content
with
these
reason
,
I
freely
confess
<EOS>
I
see
no
other
motive
to
the
action
of
that
lady
,
unless
we
will
conceive
she
be
bribe
by
Lord
Fellamar
,
which
for
my
own
part
I
see
no
cause
to
suspect
.
  
<EOS>
now
this
be
the
affair
which
Mrs
Western
be
prepare
to
introduce
to
Sophia
,
by
some
prefatory
discourse
on
the
folly
of
love
,
and
on
the
wisdom
of
legal
prostitution
for
hire
,
when
her
brother
and
Blifil
break
abruptly
in
upon
her
;
and
hence
arise
all
that
coldness
in
her
behaviour
to
Blifil
,
which
,
though
the
squire
,
as
be
usual
with
him
,
impute
to
a
wrong
cause
,
infuse
into
Blifil
himself
<EOS>
(
he
be
a
much
more
cunning
man
)
<EOS>
a
suspicion
of
the
real
truth
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
Jones
pay
a
visit
to
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
.
 
<EOS>
the
reader
may
now
,
perhaps
,
be
pleased
to
return
with
us
to
Mr
Jones
,
who
,
at
the
appoint
hour
,
attend
on
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
;
but
before
we
relate
the
conversation
which
now
past
it
may
be
proper
,
accord
to
our
method
,
to
return
a
little
back
,
and
to
account
for
so
great
an
alteration
of
behaviour
in
this
lady
,
that
from
change
her
lodging
principally
to
avoid
Mr
Jones
,
she
have
now
industriously
,
as
hath
be
see
,
seek
this
interview
.
  
<EOS>
and
here
we
shall
need
only
to
resort
to
what
happen
the
precede
day
,
when
,
hear
from
Lady
Bellaston
that
Mr
Western
be
arrive
in
town
<EOS>
,
she
go
to
pay
her
duty
to
him
,
at
his
lodging
at
Piccadilly
,
where
she
be
receive
with
many
scurvy
compellation
too
coarse
to
be
repeat
,
and
be
even
threaten
to
be
kick
out
of
door
.
<EOS>
from
hence
,
an
old
servant
of
her
aunt
Western
,
with
whom
she
be
well
acquaint
,
conduct
her
to
the
lodging
of
that
lady
,
who
treat
her
not
more
kindly
,
but
more
politely
;
or
,
to
say
the
truth
,
with
rudeness
in
another
way
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
she
return
from
both
,
plainly
convinced
,
not
only
that
her
scheme
of
reconciliation
have
prove
abortive
,
but
that
she
must
for
ever
give
over
all
thought
of
bring
it
about
by
any
mean
whatever
.
<EOS>
from
this
moment
desire
of
revenge
only
fill
her
mind
;
and
in
this
temper
meeting
Jones
at
the
play
,
an
opportunity
seem
to
her
to
occur
of
effect
this
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
must
remember
that
he
be
acquaint
by
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
in
the
account
she
give
of
her
own
story
,
with
the
fondness
Mrs
Western
have
formerly
shew
for
Mr
Fitzpatrick
at
Bath
,
from
the
disappointment
of
which
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
derive
the
great
bitterness
her
aunt
have
express
toward
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
therefore
,
no
doubt
but
that
the
good
lady
would
as
easily
listen
to
the
address
of
Mr
Jones
as
she
have
before
do
to
the
other
;
for
the
superiority
of
charm
be
clearly
on
the
side
of
Mr
Jones
;
and
the
advance
which
her
aunt
have
since
make
in
age
<EOS>
,
she
conclude
(
how
justly
I
will
not
say
)
,
be
an
argument
rather
in
favour
of
her
project
than
against
it
.
  
<EOS>
therefore
,
when
Jones
attend
,
after
a
previous
declaration
of
her
desire
of
serve
him
,
arise
,
as
she
say
,
from
a
firm
assurance
how
much
she
should
by
so
do
oblige
Sophia
;
and
after
some
excuse
for
her
former
disappointment
,
and
after
acquaint
Mr
Jones
in
whose
custody
his
mistress
be
,
of
which
she
think
him
ignorant
;
she
very
explicitly
mention
her
scheme
to
him
,
and
advise
him
to
make
sham
address
to
the
old
lady
,
in
order
to
procure
an
easy
access
to
the
young
,
inform
him
at
the
same
time
of
the
success
which
Mr
Fitzpatrick
have
formerly
owe
to
the
very
same
stratagem
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Jones
express
great
gratitude
to
the
lady
for
the
kind
intention
towards
him
which
she
have
express
,
and
indeed
testify
,
by
this
proposal
;
but
,
besides
intimate
some
diffidence
of
success
from
the
lady
's
knowledge
of
his
love
to
her
niece
,
which
have
not
be
her
case
in
regard
to
Mr
Fitzpatrick
,
he
say
,
he
be
afraid
Miss
Western
would
never
agree
to
an
imposition
of
this
kind
,
as
well
from
her
utter
detestation
of
all
fallacy
as
from
her
avow
duty
to
her
aunt
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
be
a
little
nettle
at
this
;
and
indeed
,
if
it
may
not
be
call
a
lapse
of
the
tongue
,
it
be
a
small
deviation
from
politeness
in
Jones
,
and
into
which
he
scarce
would
have
fall
,
have
not
the
delight
he
feel
in
praise
Sophia
hurry
him
out
of
all
reflection
;
for
this
commendation
of
one
cousin
be
more
than
a
tacit
rebuke
on
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
sir
,
"
answer
the
lady
,
with
some
warmth
,
"
I
can
not
think
there
be
anything
easy
than
to
cheat
an
old
woman
with
a
profession
of
love
,
when
her
complexion
be
amorous
;
and
,
though
she
be
my
aunt
,
I
must
say
there
never
be
a
more
liquorish
one
than
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
can
not
you
pretend
that
the
despair
of
possess
her
niece
,
from
her
be
promise
to
Blifil
,
have
make
you
turn
your
thought
towards
her
?
<EOS>
as
to
my
cousin
Sophia
,
I
can
not
imagine
her
to
be
such
a
simpleton
as
to
have
the
least
scruple
on
such
an
account
,
or
to
conceive
any
harm
in
punish
one
of
these
haggs
for
the
many
mischief
they
bring
upon
family
by
their
tragi
-
comic
passion
;
for
which
I
think
it
be
a
pity
they
be
not
punishable
by
law
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
such
scruple
myself
;
and
yet
I
hope
my
cousin
Sophia
will
not
think
it
an
affront
<EOS>
when
I
say
she
can
not
detest
every
real
specie
of
falsehood
more
than
her
cousin
Fitzpatrick
.
<EOS>
to
my
aunt
,
indeed
,
I
pretend
no
duty
,
nor
doth
she
deserve
any
.
<EOS>
however
,
sir
,
I
have
give
you
my
advice
;
and
if
you
decline
pursue
it
,
I
shall
have
the
less
opinion
of
your
understanding
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
now
clearly
see
the
error
he
have
commit
,
and
exert
his
utmost
power
to
rectify
it
;
but
he
only
faultere
and
stutter
into
nonsense
and
contradiction
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
it
be
often
safe
to
abide
by
the
consequence
of
the
first
blunder
than
to
endeavour
to
rectify
it
;
for
by
such
endeavour
we
generally
plunge
deep
instead
of
extricate
ourselves
;
and
few
person
will
on
such
occasion
have
the
good
-
nature
which
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
display
to
Jones
,
by
say
,
with
a
smile
,
"
You
need
attempt
no
more
excuse
;
for
I
can
easily
forgive
a
real
lover
,
<EOS>
whatever
be
the
effect
of
fondness
for
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
then
renew
her
proposal
,
and
very
fervently
recommend
it
,
omit
no
argument
which
her
invention
could
suggest
on
the
subject
;
for
she
be
so
violently
incensed
against
her
aunt
,
that
scarce
anything
be
capable
of
afford
her
equal
pleasure
with
expose
her
;
and
,
like
a
true
woman
,
she
would
see
no
difficulty
in
the
execution
of
a
favourite
scheme
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
,
however
,
persist
in
decline
the
undertaking
,
which
have
not
,
indeed
,
the
least
probability
of
success
.
<EOS>
He
easily
perceive
the
motive
which
induce
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
to
be
so
eager
in
press
her
advice
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
would
not
deny
the
tender
and
passionate
regard
he
have
for
Sophia
;
but
be
so
conscious
of
the
inequality
of
their
situation
,
that
he
could
never
flatter
himself
so
far
as
to
hope
that
so
divine
a
young
lady
would
condescend
to
think
on
so
unworthy
a
man
;
nay
,
he
protest
,
he
could
scarce
bring
himself
to
wish
she
should
.
<EOS>
He
conclude
with
a
profession
of
generous
sentiment
,
which
we
have
not
at
present
leisure
to
insert
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
some
fine
woman
(
for
I
dare
not
here
speak
in
too
general
term
)
with
whom
self
be
so
predominant
,
that
they
never
detach
it
from
any
subject
;
and
,
as
vanity
be
with
them
a
rule
principle
,
they
be
apt
to
lay
hold
of
whatever
praise
they
meet
with
;
and
,
though
the
property
of
other
,
convey
it
to
their
own
use
.
<EOS>
in
the
company
of
these
lady
it
be
impossible
to
say
anything
handsome
of
another
woman
which
they
will
not
apply
to
themselves
;
nay
,
they
often
improve
the
praise
they
seize
;
as
,
for
instance
,
if
her
beauty
,
her
wit
,
her
gentility
,
her
good
humour
deserve
so
much
commendation
,
what
do
I
deserve
,
who
possess
those
quality
in
so
much
more
eminent
a
degree
?
  
<EOS>
to
these
lady
a
man
often
recommend
himself
while
he
be
commend
another
woman
;
and
,
while
he
be
express
ardour
and
generous
sentiment
for
his
mistress
,
they
be
consider
what
a
charming
lover
this
man
would
make
to
them
,
who
can
feel
all
this
tenderness
for
an
inferior
degree
of
merit
.
<EOS>
of
this
,
strange
as
it
may
seem
,
I
have
see
many
instance
besides
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
to
whom
all
this
really
happen
,
and
who
now
begin
to
feel
a
somewhat
for
Mr
Jones
,
the
symptom
of
which
she
much
sooner
understand
than
poor
Sophia
have
formerly
do
.
  
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
perfect
beauty
in
both
sex
be
a
more
irresistible
object
than
it
be
generally
think
;
for
,
notwithstanding
some
of
us
be
content
with
more
homely
lot
,
and
learn
by
rote
(
as
child
to
repeat
what
give
them
no
idea
)
to
despise
outside
,
and
to
value
more
solid
charm
;
yet
I
have
always
observe
,
at
the
approach
of
consummate
beauty
,
that
these
more
solid
charm
only
shine
with
that
kind
of
lustre
which
the
star
have
after
the
rise
of
the
sun
.
  
<EOS>
when
Jones
have
finish
his
exclamation
,
many
of
which
would
have
become
the
mouth
of
Oroondates
himself
,
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
heave
a
deep
sigh
,
and
,
take
her
eye
off
from
Jones
,
on
whom
they
have
be
some
time
fix
,
and
drop
them
on
the
ground
,
she
cry
,
"
indeed
,
Mr
Jones
,
I
pity
you
;
but
it
be
the
curse
of
such
tenderness
to
be
throw
away
on
those
who
be
insensible
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
my
cousin
better
than
you
,
Mr
Jones
,
and
I
must
say
,
any
woman
who
make
no
return
to
such
a
passion
,
and
such
a
person
,
be
unworthy
of
both
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
sure
,
madam
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
you
can
not
mean
"
<EOS>
"
mean
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
"
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
I
mean
;
there
be
something
,
I
think
,
in
true
tenderness
bewitch
;
few
woman
ever
meet
with
it
in
man
,
and
few
still
know
how
to
value
it
when
they
do
.
<EOS>
I
never
hear
such
truly
noble
sentiment
,
and
I
can
not
tell
how
it
be
,
but
you
force
one
to
believe
you
.
<EOS>
sure
she
must
be
the
most
contemptible
of
woman
who
can
overlook
such
merit
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
manner
and
look
with
which
all
this
be
speak
infuse
a
suspicion
into
Jones
which
we
do
not
care
to
convey
in
direct
word
to
the
reader
.
<EOS>
instead
of
make
any
answer
,
he
say
,
"
I
be
afraid
,
madam
,
<EOS>
I
have
make
too
tiresome
a
visit
;
"
and
offer
to
take
his
leave
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
,
sir
,
"
answer
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
.
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
pity
you
,
Mr
Jones
;
indeed
I
do
:
<EOS>
but
if
you
be
go
,
consider
of
the
scheme
I
have
mention
 
I
be
convince
you
will
approve
it
 
and
let
me
see
you
again
as
soon
as
you
can
.
 
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
morning
if
you
will
,
or
at
least
some
time
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
at
home
all
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
,
then
,
after
many
expression
of
thank
,
very
respectfully
retire
;
nor
could
mrs
Fitzpatrick
forbear
make
him
a
present
of
a
look
at
parting
,
by
which
if
he
have
understand
nothing
,
he
must
have
have
no
understanding
in
the
language
of
the
eye
.
<EOS>
in
reality
,
it
confirm
his
resolution
of
return
to
her
no
more
;
for
,
faulty
as
he
hath
hitherto
appear
in
this
history
,
his
whole
thought
be
now
so
confine
to
his
Sophia
,
that
I
believe
no
woman
upon
earth
could
have
now
draw
him
into
an
act
of
inconstancy
.
  
<EOS>
Fortune
,
however
,
who
be
not
his
friend
,
resolve
,
as
he
intend
to
give
her
no
second
opportunity
,
to
make
the
good
of
this
;
and
accordingly
produce
the
tragical
incident
which
we
be
now
in
sorrowful
note
to
record
.
    
<EOS>
the
consequence
of
the
precede
visit
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Fitzpatrick
have
receive
the
letter
before
mention
from
Mrs
Western
,
and
be
by
that
mean
acquaint
with
the
place
to
which
his
wife
be
retire
,
return
directly
to
Bath
,
and
thence
the
day
after
set
forward
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
hath
be
already
often
inform
of
the
jealous
temper
of
this
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
may
likewise
be
pleased
to
remember
the
suspicion
which
he
have
conceive
of
Jones
at
Upton
,
upon
his
find
him
in
the
room
with
Mrs
Waters
;
and
,
though
sufficient
reason
have
afterwards
appear
entirely
to
clear
up
that
suspicion
,
yet
now
the
reading
so
handsome
a
character
of
Mr
Jones
from
his
wife
,
cause
him
to
reflect
that
she
likewise
be
in
the
inn
at
the
same
time
,
and
jumble
together
such
a
confusion
of
circumstance
in
a
head
which
be
naturally
none
of
the
clear
,
that
the
whole
produce
that
green
-
eyed
monster
mention
by
Shakespear
in
his
tragedy
of
Othello
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
as
he
be
enquire
in
the
street
after
his
wife
,
and
have
just
receive
direction
to
the
door
,
unfortunately
Mr
Jones
be
issue
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
Fitzpatrick
do
not
yet
recollect
the
face
of
Jones
;
however
,
see
a
young
well
-
dress
fellow
come
from
his
wife
,
he
make
directly
up
to
him
,
and
ask
him
what
he
have
be
do
in
that
house
?
"
<EOS>
for
I
be
sure
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
must
have
be
in
it
,
as
I
see
you
come
out
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
answer
very
modestly
,
"
that
he
have
be
visit
a
lady
there
.
"
<EOS>
to
which
Fitzpatrick
reply
,
"
what
business
have
you
with
the
lady
?
"
<EOS>
upon
which
Jones
,
who
now
perfectly
remember
the
voice
,
feature
,
and
indeed
coat
,
of
the
gentleman
,
cry
out
"
ha
,
my
good
friend
!
<EOS>
give
me
your
hand
;
I
hope
there
be
no
ill
blood
remain
between
us
,
upon
a
small
mistake
which
happen
so
long
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
upon
my
soul
,
sir
,
"
say
Fitzpatrick
,
"
I
do
not
know
your
name
nor
your
face
.
"
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
sir
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
neither
have
I
the
pleasure
of
know
your
name
,
but
your
face
I
very
well
remember
to
have
see
before
at
Upton
,
where
a
foolish
quarrel
happen
between
us
,
which
,
if
it
be
not
make
up
yet
,
we
will
now
make
up
over
a
bottle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
at
Upton
!
"
cry
the
other
;
 
"
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
upon
my
soul
,
I
believe
your
name
be
Jones
?
"
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
"
answer
he
,
"
it
be
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
o
!
<EOS>
upon
my
soul
,
"
cry
Fitzpatrick
,
"
you
be
the
very
man
I
want
to
meet
.
 
<EOS>
upon
my
soul
I
will
drink
a
bottle
with
you
presently
;
but
first
I
will
give
you
a
great
knock
over
the
pate
.
<EOS>
there
be
for
you
,
you
rascal
.
<EOS>
upon
my
soul
,
if
you
do
not
give
me
satisfaction
for
that
blow
,
I
will
give
you
another
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
draw
his
sword
,
put
himself
in
a
posture
of
defence
,
which
be
the
only
science
he
understand
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
be
a
little
stagger
by
the
blow
,
which
come
somewhat
unexpectedly
;
but
presently
recover
himself
he
also
draw
,
and
though
he
understand
nothing
of
fence
,
pr
on
so
boldly
upon
Fitzpatrick
,
that
he
beat
down
his
guard
,
and
sheathe
one
half
of
his
sword
in
the
body
of
the
said
gentleman
,
who
have
no
sooner
receive
it
than
he
stept
backwards
,
drop
the
point
of
his
sword
,
and
lean
upon
it
,
cry
,
"
I
have
satisfaction
enough
:
I
be
a
dead
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
but
whatever
be
the
consequence
,
you
must
be
sensible
you
have
draw
it
upon
yourself
.
"
<EOS>
at
this
instant
a
number
of
fellow
rush
in
and
seize
Jones
,
who
tell
them
he
should
make
no
resistance
,
and
beg
some
of
them
at
least
would
take
care
of
the
wounded
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
"
cry
one
of
the
fellow
<EOS>
,
"
the
wound
gentleman
will
be
take
care
enough
of
;
for
I
suppose
he
hath
not
many
hour
to
live
.
<EOS>
as
for
you
,
sir
,
you
have
a
month
at
least
good
yet
.
"
<EOS>
"
D####n
me
,
Jack
,
"
say
another
,
"
he
hath
prevent
his
voyage
;
he
be
bind
to
another
port
now
;
"
and
many
other
such
jest
be
our
poor
Jones
make
the
subject
of
by
these
fellow
,
who
be
indeed
the
gang
employ
by
Lord
Fellamar
,
and
have
dog
him
into
the
house
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
wait
for
him
at
the
corner
of
the
street
when
this
unfortunate
accident
happen
.
  
<EOS>
the
officer
who
command
this
gang
very
wisely
conclude
that
his
business
be
now
to
deliver
his
prisoner
into
the
hand
of
the
civil
magistrate
.
<EOS>
He
order
him
,
therefore
,
to
be
carry
to
a
public
-
house
,
where
,
have
send
for
a
constable
,
he
deliver
him
to
his
custody
.
  
<EOS>
the
constable
,
see
Mr
Jones
very
well
dr
,
and
hear
that
the
accident
have
happen
in
a
duel
,
treat
his
prisoner
with
great
civility
,
and
at
his
request
dispatch
a
messenger
to
enquire
after
the
wound
gentleman
,
who
be
now
at
a
tavern
under
the
surgeon
's
hand
.
<EOS>
the
report
bring
back
be
,
that
the
wound
be
certainly
mortal
,
and
there
be
no
hope
of
life
.
<EOS>
upon
which
the
constable
inform
Jones
that
he
must
go
before
a
justice
.
<EOS>
He
answer
,
"
wherever
you
please
;
I
be
indifferent
as
to
what
happen
to
me
;
for
though
I
be
convince
I
be
not
guilty
of
murder
in
the
eye
of
the
law
,

the
weight
of
blood
I
find
intolerable
upon
my

<EOS>
Jones
be
now
conduct
before
the
justice
,
where
the
surgeon
who
dress
Mr
Fitzpatrick
appear
,
and
depose
that
he
believe
the
wound
to
be
mortal
;
upon
which
the
prisoner
be
commit
to
the
Gatehouse
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
late
at
night
,
so
that
Jones
would
not
send
for
Partridge
till
the
next
morning
;
and
,
as
he
never
shut
his
eye
till
seven
,
so
it
be
near
twelve
before
the
poor
fellow
,
who
be
greatly
frightened
at
not
hear
from
his
master
so
long
,
receive
a
message
which
almost
deprive
him
of
his
being
when
he
hear
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
go
to
the
Gatehouse
with
tremble
knee
and
a
beat
heart
,
and
be
no
sooner
arrive
in
the
presence
of
Jones
than
he
lament
the
misfortune
that
have
befall
him
with
many
tear
,
look
all
the
while
frequently
about
him
in
great
terror
;
for
as
the
news
now
arrive
that
Mr
Fitzpatrick
be
dead
,
the
poor
fellow
apprehend
every
minute
that
his
ghost
would
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
deliver
him
a
letter
,
which
he
have
like
to
have
forget
,
and
which
come
from
Sophia
by
the
hand
of
Black
George
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
presently
dispatch
every
one
out
of
the
room
,
and
,
have
eagerly
break
open
the
letter
,
read
as
follow
:
      
<EOS>
"
You
owe
the
hearing
from
me
again
to
an
accident
which
I
own
  
surprize
me
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
hath
just
now
show
me
a
letter
from
you
to
  
Lady
Bellaston
,
which
contain
a
proposal
of
marriage
.
<EOS>
I
be
  
<EOS>
convinced
it
be
your
own
hand
;
and
what
more
surprize
me
be
,
that
  
it
be
date
at
the
very
time
when
you
would
have
me
imagine
you
be
  
under
such
concern
on
my
account
.
 
<EOS>
I
leave
you
to
comment
on
this
  
fact
.
<EOS>
all
I
desire
be
,
that
your
name
may
never
more
be

"

"
  
of
the
present
situation
of
Mr
Jones
's
mind
,
and
of
the
pang
with
which
he
be
now
torment
,
we
can
not
give
the
reader
a
well
idea
than
by
say
,
his
misery
be
such
that
even
Thwackum
would
almost
have
pity
him
.
<EOS>
but
,
bad
as
it
be
,
we
shall
at
present
leave
him
in
it
,
as
his
good
genius
(
if
he
really
have
any
)
seem
to
have
do
.
<EOS>
and
here
we
put
an
end
to
the
sixteenth
book
of
our
history
.
  
<EOS>
BOOK
XVII
.
  
<EOS>
contain
three
day
.
    
<EOS>
contain
a
portion
of
introductory
writing
.
 
<EOS>
when
a
comic
writer
hath
make
his
principal
character
as
happy
as
he
can
,
or
when
a
tragic
writer
hath
bring
them
to
the
high
pitch
of
human
misery
,
they
both
conclude
their
business
to
be
do
,
and
that
their
work
be
come
to
a
period
.
  
<EOS>
have
we
be
of
the
tragic
complexion
,
the
reader
must
now
allow
we
be
very
nearly
arrive
at
this
period
,
since
it
would
be
difficult
for
the
devil
,
or
any
of
his
representative
on
earth
,
to
have
contrive
much
great
torment
for
poor
Jones
than
those
in
which
we
leave
him
in
the
last
chapter
;
and
as
for
Sophia
,
a
good
-
natured
woman
would
hardly
wish
more
uneasiness
to
a
rival
than
what
she
must
at
present
be
suppose
to
feel
.
<EOS>
what
then
remain
to
complete
the
tragedy
but
a
murder
or
two
and
a
few
moral
sentence
!
  
<EOS>
but
to
bring
our
favourite
out
of
their
present
anguish
and
distress
,
and
to
land
them
at
last
on
the
shore
of
happiness
,
seem
a
much
hard
task
;
a
task
indeed
so
hard
that
we
do
not
undertake
to
execute
it
.
<EOS>
in
regard
to
Sophia
,
it
be
more
than
probable
that
we
shall
somewhere
or
other
provide
a
good
husband
for
her
in
the
end
 
<EOS>
either
Blifil
,
or
my
lord
,
or
somebody
else
;
but
as
to
poor
Jones
,
such
be
the
calamity
in
which
he
be
at
present
involve
,
owe
to
his
imprudence
,
by
which
if
a
man
doth
not
become
felon
to
the
world
,
he
be
at
least
a
felo
de
se
;
so
destitute
be
he
now
of
friend
,
and
so
persecute
by
enemy
,
that
we
almost
despair
of
bring
him
to
any
good
;
and
if
our
reader
delight
in
see
execution
,
I
think
he
ought
not
to
lose
any
time
in
take
a
first
row
at
Tyburn
.
  
<EOS>
this
I
faithfully
promise
,
that
,
notwithstanding
any
affection
which
we
may
be
suppose
to
have
for
this
rogue
,
whom
we
have
unfortunately
make
our
heroe
,
we
will
lend
him
none
of
that
supernatural
assistance
with
which
we
be
entrust
,
upon
condition
that
we
use
it
only
on
very
important
occasion
.
<EOS>
if
he
doth
not
therefore
find
some
natural
mean
of
fairly
extricate
himself
from
all
his
distress
,
we
will
do
no
violence
to
the
truth
and
dignity
of
history
for
his
sake
;
for
we
have
rather
relate
that
he
be
hang
at
Tyburn
(
which
may
very
probably
be
the
case
)
than
forfeit
our
integrity
,
or
shock
the
faith
of
our
reader
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
the
antient
have
a
great
advantage
over
the
modern
.
<EOS>
Their
mythology
,
which
be
at
that
time
more
firmly
believe
by
the
vulgar
than
any
religion
be
at
present
,
give
them
always
an
opportunity
of
deliver
a
favourite
heroe
.
<EOS>
Their
deity
be
always
ready
at
the
writer
's
elbow
,
to
execute
any
of
his
purpose
;
and
the
more
extraordinary
the
invention
be
,
the
great
be
the
surprize
and
delight
of
the
credulous
reader
.
<EOS>
those
writer
could
with
great
ease
have
convey
a
heroe
from
one
country
to
another
,
nay
from
one
world
to
another
,
and
have
bring
him
back
again
,
than
a
poor
circumscribe
modern
can
deliver
him
from
a
jail
.
  
<EOS>
the
Arabians
and
Persians
have
an
equal
advantage
in
write
their
tale
from
the
genius
and
fairy
,
which
they
believe
in
as
an
article
of
their
faith
,
upon
the
authority
of
the
Koran
itself
.
<EOS>
but
we
have
none
of
these
help
.
<EOS>
to
natural
mean
alone
we
be
confine
;
let
us
try
therefore
what
,
by
these
mean
,
may
be
do
for
poor
Jones
;
though
to
confess
the
truth
,
something
whisper
me
in
the
ear
that
he
doth
not
yet
know
the
bad
of
his
fortune
;
and
that
a
more
shocking
piece
of
news
than
any
<EOS>
he
hath
yet
hear
remain
for
him
in
the
unopened
leave
of
fate
.
    
<EOS>
the
generous
and
grateful
behaviour
of
Mrs
Miller
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
and
Mrs
Miller
be
just
sit
down
to
breakfast
,
when
Blifil
,
who
have
go
out
very
early
that
morning
,
return
to
make
one
of
the
company
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
long
seat
before
he
begin
as
follow
:
"
<EOS>
Good
Lord
!
<EOS>
my
dear
uncle
,
what
do
you
think
hath
happen
?
<EOS>
I
vow
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
of
tell
it
you
,
for
fear
of
shock
you
with
the
remembrance
of
ever
have
shew
any
kindness
to
such
a
villain
.
"
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
,
child
?
"
say
the
uncle
.
<EOS>
"
I
fear
I
have
shew
kindness
in
my
life
to
the
unworthy
more
than
once
.
<EOS>
but
charity
doth
not
adopt
the
vice
of
its
object
.
"
<EOS>
"
o
,
sir
!
"
return
Blifil
,
"
it
be
not
without
the
secret
direction
of
Providence
that
you
mention
the
word
adoption
.
<EOS>
Your
adopted
son
,
sir
,
that
Jones
,
that
wretch
whom
you
nourish
in
your
bosom
,
hath
prove
one
of
the
great
villain
upon
earth
.
"
<EOS>
"
by
all
that
be
sacred
'
tis
false
,
"
cry
Mrs
Miller
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Jones
be
no
villain
.
<EOS>
He
be
one
of
the
worthy
creature
breathing
;
and
if
any
other
person
have
call
him
villain
,
I
would
have
throw
all
this
boiling
water
in
his
face
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
look
very
much
amazed
at
this
behaviour
.
<EOS>
but
she
do
not
give
him
leave
to
speak
,
before
,
turn
to
him
<EOS>
,
she
cry
,
"
I
hope
you
will
not
be
angry
with
me
;
I
would
not
offend
you
,
sir
,
for
the
world
;
but
,
indeed
,
I
could
not
bear
to
hear
him
call
so
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
must
own
,
madam
,
"
say
Allworthy
,
very
gravely
,
"
I
be
a
little
surprized
to
hear
you
so
warmly
defend
a
fellow
you
do
not
know

"
<EOS>
"
o
!
<EOS>
I
do
know
him
,
Mr
Allworthy
,
"
say
she
,
"
indeed
I
do
<EOS>
;
I
should
be
the
most
ungrateful
of
all
wretch
if
I
deny
it
.
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
he
hath
preserve
me
and
my
little
family
;
we
have
all
reason
to
bless
him
while
we
live
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
pray
Heaven
to
bless
him
,
and
turn
the
heart
of
his
malicious
enemy
.
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
,
I
find
,
I
see
,
he
hath
such
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
surprize
me
,
madam
,
still
more
,
"
say
Allworthy
;
"
sure
you
must
mean
some
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
you
should
have
any
such
obligation
to
the
man
my
nephew
mention
.
"
<EOS>
"
too
surely
,
"
answer
she
,
"
I
have
obligation
to
him
of
the
great
and
tender
kind
.
<EOS>
He
hath
be
the
preserver
of
me
and
mine
.
<EOS>
believe
me
,
sir
,
he
hath
be
abuse
,
grossly
abused
to
you
;
I
know
he
hath
,
or
you
,
whom
I
know
to
be
all
goodness
and
honour
,
<EOS>
would
not
,
after
the
many
kind
and
tender
thing
I
have
hear
you
say
of
this
poor
helpless
child
,
have
so
disdainfully
call
him
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
my
good
of
friend
,
he
deserve
a
kind
appellation
from
you
,
have
you
hear
the
good
,
the
kind
,
the
grateful
thing
which
I
have
hear
him
utter
of
you

<EOS>
He
never
mention
your
name
but
with
a
sort
of
adoration
.
<EOS>
in
this
very
room
I
have
see
him
on
his
knee
,
implore
all
the
blessing
of
heaven
upon
your
head

<EOS>
I
do
not
love
that
child
there
better
than
he
love
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
,
sir
,
now
,
"
say
Blifil
,
with
one
of
those
grin
sneer
with
which
the
devil
mark
his
good
beloved
,
"
Mrs
Miller
really
doth
know
him
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
will
find
she
be
not
the
only
one
of
your
acquaintance
to
whom
he
hath
expose
you

<EOS>
as
for
my
character
,
I
perceive
,
by
some
hint
<EOS>
she
hath
throw
out
,
he
hath
be
very
free
with
it
,
but
I
forgive
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
and
the
Lord
forgive
you
,
sir
!

say
Mrs
Miller
;
"
we
have
all
sin
enough
to
stand
in
need
of
his
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
Mrs
Miller
,
"
say
Allworthy
,
"
I
do
not
take
this
behaviour
of
yours
to
my
nephew
kindly
;
and
I
do
assure
you
,
as
any
reflection
which
you
cast
upon
him
must
come
only
from
that
wickedest
of
man
<EOS>
,
they
would
only
serve
,
if
that
be
possible
,
to
heighten
my
resentment
against
him
:
<EOS>
for
I
must
tell
you
,
Mrs
Miller
,
the
young
man
who
now
stand
before
you
hath
ever
be
the
warm
advocate
for
the
ungrateful
wretch
whose
cause
you
espouse
.
<EOS>
this
,
I
think
,
when
you
hear
it
from
my
own
mouth
,
will
make
you
wonder
at
so
much
baseness
and
ingratitude
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
deceive
,
sir
,
"
answer
Mrs
Miller
;
"
if
they
be
the
last
word
which
be
to
issue
from
my
lip
,
I
would
say
you
be
deceive
;
and
I
once
more
repeat
it
,
the
Lord
forgive
those
who
have
deceive
you
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
to
say
the
young
man
be
without
fault
;
but
they
be
all
the
fault
of
wildness
and
of
youth
;
fault
which
he
may
,
nay
,
which
I
be
certain
he
will
,
relinquish
,
and
,
if
he
should
not
,
they
be
vastly
overbalance
by
one
of
the
most
humane
,
tender
,
honest
heart
that
ever
man
be
bless
with

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
Mrs
Miller
,
"
say
Allworthy
,
"
have
this
be
relate
of
you
,
I
should
not
have
believe
it

"
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
sir
,
"
answer
she
,
"
you
will
believe
everything
I
have
say
,
I
be
sure
you
will
:
and
when
you
have
hear
the
story
which
I
shall
tell
you
(
for
I
will
tell
you
all

,
you
will
be
so
far
from

that
you
will
own
(
I
know
your
justice
so
well

that
I
must
have

the
most
despicable

of

I
have

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
madam

Allworthy

"
I
shall
be
very
glad
to
hear
any
good
excuse
for
a
behaviour
which
,
I
must
confess
<EOS>

I
think
want
an
excuse

and
now
,
madam
,
will
you
be
pleased
to
let
my
nephew
proceed
in
his
story
without
interruption

<EOS>
He
would
not
have
introduce
a
matter
of
slight
consequence
with
such
a
preface
.
<EOS>
perhaps
even
this
story
will
cure
you
of
your
mistake

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Miller
give
token
of
submission
,
and
then
Mr
Blifil
begin
thus
:
"
I
be
sure
,
sir

if
you
do
not

proper
to
resent

ill

usage

I
shall
easily
forgive

notwithstanding
all
Mrs

hath
say

I
be
very

what
you

it

I
be
convince
the

Heaven
know
there

the
gentleman
I
ever

I
never

be
thus

on

violent
knocking
at
the

their
conversation

<EOS>
some

may

perhaps
,
be
pleased
with
these
minute
circumstance
,
in
relating
of
which
we
follow
the
example
of
Plutarch
,
one
of
the
good
of
our
brother
historian

other
,
to
whom
they
may
appear
trivial

the
arrival
of

<EOS>
Mrs

have
not
long
leave
the
room
when
Mr
Western
enter
;
but
not
before
a
small
wrangle
bout
have
pass
between
him
and
his
chairman
;
for
the
fellow
,
who
have
take
up
their
burden
at
the
Hercules
Pillars
,
have
conceive
no
hope
of
have
any
future
good
customer
in
the
squire
;
and
they
be
moreover
farther
encourage
by
his
generosity
<EOS>
(
for
he
have
give
them
of
his
own
accord
sixpence
more
than
their
fare
)
;
they
therefore
very
boldly
demand
another
shilling
,
which
so
provoke
the
squire
,
that
he
not
only
bestow
many
hearty
curse
on
them
at
the
door
,
but
retain
his
anger
after
he
come
into
the
room
;
swear
that
all
the
Londoners
be
like
the
court

thought
of
nothing

more

on

Mr

<EOS>

he
.
<EOS>
"
why

then
,
sir

"
cry
Allworthy
,
"
<EOS>
I
can
truly
say
,
without
a
compliment
either
to
you
or
the
young
lady
,
that
when
this
match
be
propose
,
I
embrace
it
very
readily
and
heartily
,
from
my
regard
to
you
both
.
<EOS>
an
alliance
between
two
family
so
nearly
neighbour
,
and
between
whom
there
have
always
exist
so
mutual
an
intercourse
and
good
harmony
<EOS>
,
I
think
a
most
desirable
event
;
and
with
regard
to
the
young
lady
,
not
only
the
concurrent
opinion
of
all
who
know
her
,
but
my
own
observation
assure
me
that
she
would
be
an
inestimable
treasure
to
a
good
husband
.
<EOS>
I
shall
say
nothing
of
her
personal
qualification
,
which
certainly
be
admirable
;
her
good
nature
,
her
charitable
disposition
,
her
modesty
,
be
too
well
known
to
need
any
panegyric
:
but
she
hath
one
quality
which
exist
in
a
high
degree
in
that
good
of
woman
,
who
be
now
one
of
the
first
of
angel
,
which
,
as
it
be
not
of
a
glaring
kind
,
more
commonly
escape
observation
;
so
little
indeed
be
it
remark
,
that
I
want
a
word
to
express
it
.
<EOS>
I
must
use
negative
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
never
hear
anything
of
pertness
,
or
what
be
call
repartee
,
out
of
her
mouth
;
no
pretence
to
wit
,
much
less
to
that
kind
of
wisdom
which
be
the
result
only
of
great
learning
and
experience
,
the
affectation
of
which
,
in
a
young
woman
,
be
as
absurd
as
any
of
the
affectation
of
an
ape
.
<EOS>
no
dictatorial
sentiment
,
no
judicial
opinion
,
no
profound
criticism
.
<EOS>
whenever
I
have
see
her
in
the
company
of
man
,
she
hath
be
all
attention
,
with
the
modesty
of
a
learner
,
not
the
forwardness
of
a
teacher
.
<EOS>
You
will
pardon
me
for
it
,
but
I
once
,
to
try
her
only
,
desire
her
opinion
on
a
point
which
be
controvert
between
Mr
Thwackum
and
Mr
Square
.
<EOS>
to
which
she
answer
,
with
much
sweetness
,
"
You
will
pardon
me
,
good
Mr
Allworthy
;
I
be
sure
you
can
not
in
earnest
think
me
capable
of
decide
any
point
in
which
two
such
gentleman
disagree
.
"
<EOS>
Thwackum
and
Square
,
who
both
alike
think
themselves
sure
of
a
favourable
decision
,
second
my
request
.
<EOS>
She
answer
with
the
same
good
humour
,
"
I
must
absolutely
be
excuse
:
for
I
will
affront
neither
so
much
as
to
give
my
judgment
on
his
side
.
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
always
shew
the
high
deference
to
the
understanding
of
man
;
a
quality
absolutely
essential
to
the
make
a
good
wife
.
<EOS>
I
shall
only
add
,
that
as
she
be
most
apparently
void
of
all
affectation
,
this
deference
must
be
certainly
real
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
Blifil
sigh
bitterly
;
upon
which
Western
,
whose
eye
be
full
of
tear
at
the
praise
of
Sophia
,
blubber
out
,
"
do
not

be
twenty
time

good

"
  
<EOS>
"
remember
your
promise
,
sir
,
"
cry
Allworthy
,
"
I
be
not
to
be
interrupt
.
"
<EOS>
"
well
,
shat
unt
,
"
answer
the
squire
;
"
I
will
not
speak
another
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
my
good
friend
,
"
continue
Allworthy
,
"
I
have
dwell
so
long
on
the
merit
of
this
young
lady
,
partly
as
I
really
be
in
love
with
her
character
,
and
partly
that
fortune
(
for
the
match
in
that
light
be
really
advantageous
on
my
nephew
's
side
)
may
not
be
imagine
to
be
my
principal
view
in
have
so
eagerly
embrace
the
proposal
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
heartily
wish
to
receive
so
great
a
jewel
into
my
family
;
but
though
I
may
wish
for
many
good
thing
,
I
would
not
,
therefore
,
steal
them
,
or
be
guilty
of
any
violence
or
injustice
to
possess
myself
of
them
.
<EOS>
now
to
force
a
woman
into
a
marriage
contrary
to
her
consent
or
approbation
,
be
an
act
of
such
injustice
and
oppression
,
that
I
wish
the
law
of
our
country
could
restrain
it
;
but
a
good
conscience
be
never
lawless
in
the
bad
regulated
state
,
and
will
provide
those
law
for
itself
,
which
the
neglect
of
legislator
hath
forget
to
supply
.
<EOS>
this
be
surely
a
case
of
that
kind
;
for
,
be
it
not
cruel
,
nay
,
impious
,
to
force
a
woman
into
that
state
against
her
will
;
for
her
behaviour
in
which
she
be
to
be
accountable
to
the
high
and
most
dreadful
court
of
judicature
,
and
to
answer
at
the
peril
of
her
soul
?
<EOS>
to
discharge
the
matrimonial
duty
in
an
adequate
manner
be
no
easy
task
;
and
shall
we
lay
this
burthen
upon
a
woman
,
while
we
at
the
same
time
deprive
her
of
all
that
assistance
which
may
enable
her
to
undergo
it
?
<EOS>
Shall
we
tear
her
very
heart
from
her
,
while
we
enjoin
her
duty
to
which
a
whole
heart
be
scarce
equal
?
<EOS>
I
must
speak
very
plainly
here
.
<EOS>
I
think
parent
who
act
in
this
manner
be
accessory
to
all
the
guilt
which
their
child
afterwards
incur
,
and
of
course
must
,
before
a
just
judge
,
expect
to
partake
of
their
punishment
;
but
if
they
could
avoid
this
,
good
heaven
!
<EOS>
be
there
a
soul
who
can
bear
the
thought
of
have
contribute
to
the
damnation
of
his
child
?
  
<EOS>
"
for
these
reason
,
my
good
neighbour
,
as
I
see
the
inclination
of
this
young
lady
be
most
unhappily
averse
to
my
nephew
,
I
must
decline
any
further
thought
of
the
honour
you
intend
him
,
though
I
assure
you
I
shall
always
retain
the
most
grateful
sense
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
"
say
Western
(
the
froth
burst
forth
from
his
lip
the
moment
they
be
uncork
)
<EOS>
,
"
you
can
not
say
<EOS>
but
I
have
hear
you
out
,
and
now
I
expect
you
will
hear
me
;
and
if
I
do
not
answer
every
word
<EOS>
on't
,
why
then
I
will
consent
to
gee
the
matter
up
.
<EOS>
first
then
,
I
desire
you
to
answer
me
one
question
 
<EOS>
do
not
I
beget
her
?
<EOS>
do
not
I
beget
her
?
<EOS>
answer
me
that
.
<EOS>
They
say
,
indeed
,
it
be
a
wise
father
that
know
his
own
child
;
but
I
be
sure
I
have
the
good
title
to
her
,
for
I
breed
her
up

<EOS>
but
I
believe
you
will
allow
me
to
be
her
father
,
and
if
I
be
,
be
I
not
to
govern
my
own
child
?
<EOS>
I
ask
you
that
,
be
I
not
to
govern
my
own
child
?
<EOS>
and
if
I
be
to
govern
her
in
other
matter
,
surely
I
be
to
govern
her
in
this
,
which
concern
her
most
.
<EOS>
and
what
be
I
desire
all
this
while
?
<EOS>
be
I
desire
her
to
do
anything
for
me
?
<EOS>
to
give
me
anything
?
 
<EOS>
Zu
much
on
t'other
side
,
that
I
be
only
desire
her
to
take
away
half
my
estate
now
,
and
t'other
half
when
I
die
.
<EOS>
well
,
and
what
be
it
all
vor
?
<EOS>
why
,
be
unt
it
to
make
her
happy
?
<EOS>
It
be
enough
to
make
one
mad
to
hear
volk
talk
;
if
I
be
go
to
marry
myself
,
then
she
would
ha
reason
to
cry
and
to
blubber
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
han't
I
offer
to
bind
down
my
land
in
such
a
manner
<EOS>
,
that
I
could
not
marry
if
I
would
,
see
as
narro
'
woman
upon
earth
would
ha
me
.
<EOS>
what
the
devil
in
hell
can
I
do
more
?
<EOS>
I
contribute
to
her
damnation
!
 
<EOS>
zounds
!
<EOS>
I
would
zee
all
the
world
d####n'd
bevore
her
little
vinger
should
be
hurt
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
Mr
Allworthy
,
you
must
excuse
me
,
but
I
be
surprize
to
hear
you
talk
in
zuch
a
manner
,
and
I
must
say
,
take
it
how
you
will
,
that
I
think
you
have
more
sense
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
resent
this
reflection
only
with
a
smile
;
nor
could
he
,
if
he
would
have
endeavour
it
,
have
convey
into
that
smile
any
mixture
of
malice
or
contempt
.
<EOS>
His
smile
at
folly
be
indeed
such
as
we
may
suppose
the
angel
bestow
on
the
absurdity
of
mankind
.
  
<EOS>
Blifil
now
desire
to
be
permit
to
speak
a
few
word
.
"
<EOS>
as
to
use
any
violence
on
the
young
lady
,
I
be
sure
I
shall
never
consent
to
it

<EOS>
My
conscience
will
not
permit
me
to
use
violence
on
any
one
,
much
less
on
a
lady
for
whom
,
however
cruel
she
be
to
me
,
I
shall
always
preserve
the
pure
and
sincerest
affection
;
but
yet
I
have
read
that
woman
be
seldom
proof
against
perseverance
.
<EOS>
why
may
I
not
hope
then
by
such
perseverance
at
last
to
gain
those
inclination

in
which
for
the

<EOS>
I
shall
,
perhaps
,
have
no

for
as
for
this

Mr
Western
be
so
kind
to
prefer
me
to
him

and
sure
,
sir

you
will
not
deny
but
that
a
parent
hath
at

a
negative
voice
in
these
matter

nay
,
I
have
hear
this
very
young
lady
herself
say
so
more
than
once
,
and
declare
that
she
think
child
inexcusable
who
marry
in
direct
opposition
to
the
will
of
their
parent

<EOS>
besides
,
though
the

pretension

I
do
not

alas

<EOS>
I

at

I
have
bespeak
a

mutton
roast

rib
of
pork

<EOS>
there
will
be
nobody
but
ourselves

unless
we
have
a
mind
to
have
the

for
I
have
send
Parson

down
to
Basingstoke
after
my
tobacco

box
,
which
I
leave
at

there

I
would
not

it
for

for
it
be
an
old
acquaintance
of
above
twenty
year
'
standing
.
<EOS>
I
can
tell
you
landlord
be
a
vast
comical
bitch
,
you
will
like
un
hugely
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
at
last
agree
to
this
invitation
,
and
soon
after
the
squire
go
off
,
singe
and
caper
at
the
hope
of
see
the
speedy
tragical
end
of
poor
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
be
go
,
Mr
Allworthy
resume
the
aforesaid
subject
with
much
gravity
.
<EOS>
He
tell
his
nephew
,
"
He
wish
with
all
his
heart
he
would
endeavour
to
conquer
a
passion
,
in
which
I
can
not
,
"
say
he
,
"
flatter
you
with
any
hope
of
succeed
.
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
a
vulgar
error
,
that
aversion
in
a
woman
may
be
conquer
by
perseverance
.
<EOS>
Indifference
may
,
perhaps
,
sometimes
yield
to
it
;
but
the
usual
triumph
gain
by
perseverance
in
a
lover
be
over
caprice
,
prudence
,
affectation
,
and
often
an
exorbitant
degree
of
levity
,
which
excite
woman
not
over
-
warm
in
their
constitution
to
indulge
their
vanity
by
prolong
the
time
of
courtship
,
even
when
they
be
well
enough
pleased
with
the
object
,
and
resolve
(
if
they
ever
resolve
at
all
)
to
make
him
a
very
pitiful
amend
in
the
end
.
<EOS>
but
a
fix
dislike
,
as
I
be
afraid
this
be
,
will
rather
gather
strength
than
be
conquer
by
time
.
<EOS>
besides
,
my
dear
,
I
have
another
apprehension
which
you
must
excuse
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
this
passion
which
you
have
for
this
fine
young
creature
hath
her
beautiful
person
too
much
for
its
object
,
and
be
unworthy
of
the
name
of
that
love
which
be
the
only
foundation
of
matrimonial
felicity
.
<EOS>
to
admire
,
to
like
,
and
to
long
for
the
possession
of
a
beautiful
woman
,
without
any
regard
to
her
sentiment
towards
us
,
be
,
I
be
afraid
,
too
natural
;
but
love
,
I
believe
,
be
the
child
of
love
only
;
at
least
,
I
be
pretty
confident
that
to
love
the
creature
who
we
be
assure
<EOS>
hate
us
be
not
in
human
nature
.
<EOS>
examine
your
heart
,
therefore
,
thoroughly
,
my
good
boy
,
and
if
,
upon
examination
,
you
have
but
the
least
suspicion
of
this
kind
,
I
be
sure
your
own
virtue
and
religion
will
impel
you
to
drive
so
vicious
a
passion
from
your
heart
,
and
your
good
sense
will
soon
enable
you
to
do
it
without
pain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
reader
may
pretty
well
guess
Blifil
's
answer
;
but
,
if
he
should
be
at
a
loss
,
we
be
not
at
present
at
leisure
to
satisfy
him
,
as
our
history
now
hasten
on
to
matter
of
high
importance
,
and
we
can
no
longer
bear
to
be
absent
from
Sophia
.
    
<EOS>
an
extraordinary
scene
between
Sophia
and
her
aunt
.
 
<EOS>
the
low
heifer
and
the
bleating
ewe
,
in
herd
and
flock
,
may
ramble
safe
and
unregarde
through
the
pasture
.
<EOS>
these
be
,
indeed
,
hereafter
doom
to
be
the
prey
of
man
;
yet
many
year
be
they
suffer
to
enjoy
their
liberty
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
but
if
a
plump
doe
be
discover
to
have
escape
from
the
forest
,
and
to
repose
herself
in
some
field
or
grove
,
the
whole
parish
be
presently
alarm
,
every
man
be
ready
to
set
his
dog
after
her
;
and
,
if
she
be
preserve
from
the
rest
by
the
good
squire
,
it
be
only
that
he
may
secure
her
for
his
own
eating
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
often
consider
a
very
fine
young
woman
of
fortune
and
fashion
,
when
first
find
stray
from
the
pale
of
her
nursery
,
to
be
in
pretty
much
the
same
situation
with
this
doe
.
<EOS>
the
town
be
immediately
in
an
uproar
;
she
be
hunt
from
park
to
play
,
from
court
to
assembly
,
from
assembly
to
her
own
chamber
,
and
rarely
escape
a
single
season
from
the
jaw
of
some
devourer
or
other
;
for
,
if
her
friend
protect
her
from
some
,
it
be
only
to
deliver
her
over
to
one
of
their
own
chusing
,
often
more
disagreeable
to
her
than
any
of
the
rest
;
while
whole
herd
or
flock
of
other
woman
securely
,
and
scarce
regard
,
traverse
the
park
,
the
play
,
the
opera
,
and
the
assembly
;
and
though
,
for
the
most
part
at
least
,
they
be
at
last
devour
,
yet
for
a
long
time
<EOS>
do
they
wanton
in
liberty
,
without
disturbance
or
controul
.
  
<EOS>
of
all
these
paragon
none
ever
taste
more
of
this
persecution
than
poor
Sophia
.
<EOS>
Her
ill
star
be
not
content
with
all
that
she
have
suffer
on
account
of
Blifil
<EOS>
,
they
now
raise
her
another
pursuer
,
who
seem
likely
to
torment
her
no
less
than
the
other
have
do
.
<EOS>
for
though
her
aunt
be
less
violent
,
she
be
no
less
assiduous
in
teize
her
,
than
her
father
have
be
before
.
  
<EOS>
the
servant
be
no
sooner
depart
after
dinner
than
Mrs
Western
,
who
have
open
the
matter
to
Sophia
,
inform
her
,
"
that
she
expect
his
lordship
that
very
afternoon
,

intend
to
take
the
first
opportunity

alone
with

"
<EOS>
"
if
you

with
some
spirit

I

<EOS>
"
how

<EOS>
"
You
know

the
cause

a
refusal

will
my

bad
?

there

<EOS>
"
very
little

in

if

I
would
certainly
have

deficient

not

there
must

some

tear

with

My

she

you

nothing

can
you

I

indeed

she

"
I
never

He
catch
me
in

pull
me
down
upon

settee

thrust
his
hand
into

such
violence

I

<EOS>
"
indeed
!
"
say
Mrs
Western

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes

indeed

Sophia

"
my

rudeness

I
be
astonish

the

"
<EOS>
no

I
would
have
tear
the

out

he
have
attempt
such
freedom

<EOS>
It

impossible

<EOS>
sure

Sophia

you

invent
this
to

my
indignation

I
hope

you

yet
surely
he

design

it

impossible

<EOS>
he
durst
not

besides
,
his

he

not

for
they
be
not
only
honourable

generous

<EOS>
I
do
not

;
the
age
allow
too
great
freedom

<EOS>
a
distant
salute
be
all
I
would
have
allow
before
the
ceremony

<EOS>
I
have
have
lover
formerly

not
so
long
ago
neither

several
lover

though
I
never
would
consent
to
marriage

I
never
encourage
the

freedom

<EOS>
It
be
a
foolish
custom

what
I
never
would
agree
to
.
<EOS>
no
man
kiss
more
of
me
than
my
cheek

<EOS>
It
be
as
much
as
one
can
bring
oneself
to
give
lip
up
to
a
husband
;
and
,
indeed
,
could
I
ever
have
be
persuade
to
marry

I
believe
I
should
not

soon
be
bring

so
much

"
You
will
pardon
me
,
dear

Sophia

if
I
make
one
observation
:
you
own
you
have
have
many
lover

the
world
know
it
,
even
if
you
should
deny
it

<EOS>
You
refuse
them
all
,
and
,
I
be
convince
,
one
coronet
at

among
them
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
say
true

dear
Sophy

"
answer
she

"
I
have
once
the
offer
of
a
title

"
<EOS>
"
why
,
then
,
"
say
Sophia
,
"
will
you
not
suffer
me
to
refuse
this
once
?
"
<EOS>
"
It
be
true

child
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
have
refuse
the
offer

a
title
;

it

not

good

not

very

very
good

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes

madam

Sophia

"

you

very
great

man

fortune

<EOS>
It
be
not
the
first

the

itself

"
I
own
it

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well

continue
Sophia

and
why
may
not
I
expect
to
have
a
second

perhaps
,
well
than
this
?
<EOS>
You
be
now

a
young
woman

I
be
convinced
would
not

yield
to
the
first
lover

fortune

nay

of
title
too

I
be

?
"
<EOS>

,
I
only
beg
that

alone

at

this
evening

grant
me
that

I
will
submit

I

"
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
will
grant
it

"
cry
the
aunt

<EOS>
"
Sophy
,
you
know
I
love
you
,
and
can
deny
you
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
easiness
of
my
nature
;
I
have
not
always
be
so
easy
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
formerly
think
cruel
;
by
the
man
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
I
be
call
the
cruel
Parthenissa

<EOS>
I
have
break
many
a
window
that
have
have
verse
to
the
cruel
Parthenissa
in
it
.
<EOS>
Sophy
,
I
be
never
so
handsome
as
you
,
and
yet
I
have
something
of
you
formerly
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
little
altered
.
<EOS>
kingdom
and
state
,
as
Tully
Cicero
say
in
his
epistle
,
undergo
alteration
,
and
so
must
the
human
form
.
"
<EOS>
thus
run
she
on
for
near
half
an
hour
upon
herself
,
and
her
conquest
,
and
her
cruelty
,
till
the
arrival
of
my
lord
,
who
,
after
a
most
tedious
visit
,
during
which
Mrs
Western
never
once
offer
to
leave
the
room
,
retire
,
not
much
more
satisfied
with
the
aunt
than
with
the
niece
;
for
Sophia
have
bring
her
aunt
into
so
excellent
a
temper
,
that
she
consent
to
almost
everything
her
niece
say
;
and
agree
that
a
little
distant
behaviour
may
not
be
improper
to
so
forward
a
lover
.
  
<EOS>
thus
Sophia
,
by
a
little
well
-
direct
flattery
,
for
which
surely
none
will
blame
her
,
obtain
a
little
ease
for
herself
,
and
,
at
least
,
put
off
the
evil
day
.
<EOS>
and
now
we
have
see
our
heroine
in
a
well
situation
than
she
hath
be
for
a
long
time
before
,
we
will
look
a
little
after
Mr
Jones
,
whom
we
leave
in
the
most
deplorable
situation
that
can
be
well
imagine
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Miller
and
Mr
Nightingale
visit
Jones
in
the
prison
.
 
<EOS>
when
Mr
Allworthy
and
his
nephew
go
to
meet
Mr
Western
<EOS>
,
Mrs
Miller
set
forwards
to
her
son
-
in
-
law
's
lodging
,
in
order
to
acquaint
him
with
the
accident
which
have
befall
his
friend
Jones
;
but
he
have
know
it
long
before
from
Partridge
(
for
Jones
,
when
he
leave
Mrs
Miller
,
have
be
furnish
with
a
room
in
the
same
house
with
Mr
Nightingale
)
.
<EOS>
the
good
woman
find
her
daughter
under
great
affliction
on
account
of
Mr
Jones
,
whom
have
comfort
as
well
as
she
could
,
she
set
forwards
to
the
Gatehouse
,
where
she
hear
he
be
,
and
where
Mr
Nightingale
be
arrive
before
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
firmness
and
constancy
of
a
true
friend
be
a
circumstance
so
extremely
delightful
to
person
in
any
kind
of
distress
,
that
the
distress
itself
,
if
it
be
only
temporary
,
and
admit
of
relief
,
be
more
than
compensate
by
bring
this
comfort
with
it
.
<EOS>
nor
be
instance
of
this
kind
so
rare
as
some
superficial
and
inaccurate
observer
have
report
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
want
of
compassion
be
not
to
be
number
among
our
general
fault
.
<EOS>
the
black
ingredient
which
foul
our
disposition
be
envy
.
<EOS>
hence
our
eye
be
seldom
<EOS>
,
I
be
afraid
,
turn
upward
to
those
who
be
manifestly
great
,
well
,
wise
,
or
happy
than
ourselves
,
without
some
degree
of
malignity
;
while
we
commonly
look
downwards
on
the
mean
and
miserable
with
sufficient
benevolence
and
pity
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
I
have
remark
,
that
most
of
the
defect
which
have
discover
themselves
in
the
friendship
within
my
observation
have
arise
from
envy
only
:
a
hellish
vice
;
and
yet
one
from
which
I
have
know
very
few
absolutely
exempt
.
<EOS>
but
enough
of
a
subject
which
,
if
pursue
,
would
lead
me
too
far
.
  
<EOS>
whether
it
be
that
Fortune
be
apprehensive
lest
Jones
should
sink
under
the
weight
of
his
adversity
,
and
that
she
may
thus
lose
any
future
opportunity
of
torment
him
,
or
whether
she
really
abate
somewhat
of
her
severity
towards
him
,
she
seem
a
little
to
relax
her
persecution
,
by
send
him
the
company
of
two
such
faithful
friend
,
and
what
be
perhaps
more
rare
,
a
faithful
servant
.
<EOS>
for
Partridge
,
though
he
have
many
imperfection
,
want
not
fidelity
;
and
though
fear
would
not
suffer
him
to
be
hang
for
his
master
,
yet
the
world
,
I
believe
,
could
not
have
bribe
him
to
desert
his
cause
.
  
<EOS>
while
Jones
be
express
great
satisfaction
in
the
presence
of
his
friend
,
Partridge
bring
an
account
that
Mr
Fitzpatrick
be
still
alive
,
though
the
surgeon
declare
that
he
have
very
little
hope
.
<EOS>
upon
which
,
Jones
fetch
a
deep
sigh
,
Nightingale
say
to
him
,
"
My
dear
Tom
,
why
should
you
afflict
yourself
so
upon
an
accident
,
which
,
whatever
be
the
consequence
,
can
be
attend
with
no
danger
to
you
,
and
in
which
your
conscience
can
not
accuse
you
of
have
be
the
least
to
blame
?
<EOS>
if
the
fellow
should
die
,
what
have
you
do
more
than
take
away
the
life
of
a
ruffian
in
your
own
defence
?
<EOS>
so
will
the
coroner
's
inquest
certainly
find
it
;
and
then
you
will
be
easily
admit
to
bail
;
and
,
though
you
must
undergo
the
form
of
a
trial
,
yet
it
be
a
trial
which
many
man
would
stand
for
you
for
a
shilling
.
"
<EOS>
"
come
,
come
,
Mr
Jones
,
"
say
Mrs
Miller
,
"
chear
yourself
up
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
could
not
be
the
aggressor
,
and
so
I
tell
Mr
Allworthy
,
and
so
he
shall
acknowledge
too
,
before
I
have
do
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
gravely
answer
,
"
that
whatever
may
be
his
fate
,
he
should
always
lament
the
having
shed
the
blood
of
one
of
his
fellow
-
creature
,
as
one
of
the
high
misfortune
which
could
have
befall
him
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
another
misfortune
of
the
tender
kind

Mrs

that
must

Mrs
Miller

more
than
you

indeed
Partridge

all

go
better

I

than
you

I

<EOS>

Jones
,
"
you

Mrs

<EOS>
Mrs
Miller
express
great
satisfaction
in
these
declaration
,
in
the
sincerity
of
which
she
aver
she
have
an
entire
faith
;
and
now
the
remainder
of
the
conversation
past
in
the
joint
attempt
of
that
good
woman
and
Mr
Nightingale
to
cheer
the
dejected
spirit
of
Mr
Jones
,
in
which
they
so
far
succeed
as
to
leave
him
much
better
comfort
and
satisfied
than
they
find
him
;
to
which
happy
alteration
nothing
so
much
contribute
as
the
kind
undertaking
of
Mrs
Miller
to
deliver
his
letter
to
Sophia
,
which
he
despair
of
find
any
mean
to
accomplish
;
for
when
Black
George
produce
the
last
from
Sophia
,
he
inform
Partridge
that
she
have
strictly
charge
him
,
on
pain
of
have
it
communicate
to
her
father
,
not
to
bring
her
any
answer
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
moreover
,
not
a
little
pleased
to
find
he
have
so
warm
an
advocate
to
Mr
Allworthy
himself
in
this
good
woman
,
who
be
,
in
reality
,
one
of
the
worthy
creature
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
after
about
an
hour
's
visit
from
the
lady
(
for
Nightingale
have
be
with
him
much
longer
)
,
they
both
take
their

to
him
soon
;
during
which
Mrs
Miller
say
she
hope
to
bring
him
some
good
news
from
his
mistress
,
and
Mr
Nightingale
promise
to
enquire
into
the
state
of
Mr
Fitzpatrick
's
wound
,
and
likewise
to
find
out
some
of
the

<EOS>
the
former
of
these
go
directly
in
quest
of
Sophia

whither
we
likewise
shall
now
attend
her

<EOS>
in
which
Mrs
Miller
pay
a
visit
to
Sophia
.
 
<EOS>
access
to
the
young

be
by
no

<EOS>
as

Sophia

<EOS>
curtsy
and
the

Sophia
say
,
"

"
<EOS>
"
no

answer
Mrs

,
"

say
Sophia

with
a
little
emotion

<EOS>
"
Madam

we
be
not

"
reply
Mrs

,
in
a
low
voice
.
"
<EOS>
go

say
Sophia

<EOS>
when
Betty
be

Mrs

,
"

a
very
unhappy
young

<EOS>
Sophia
change
colour
when
she
see
the
direction
,
well
know
the
hand
,
and
after
some
hesitation
,
say
 
"
I
could
not
conceive

your

,
that
your

be
of
such
a
nature

<EOS>
whomever
you
bring
this
letter
from

,
I
shall
not
open

.
<EOS>
I
should
be
sorry
to
entertain
an
unjust
suspicion
of
any
one

but
you
be
an
utter
stranger
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
have
patience
,
madam

"
answer
Mrs

,
"
I
will
acquaint
you
who
I
be

and
how
I
come
by
that
letter

"
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
curiosity
,
madam
,
to
know
anything

"
cry
Sophia
;
"
but
I
must
insist
on
your
delivering
that
letter
back
to
the
person
who
give
it
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Miller
then
fall
upon
her
knee
,
and
in
the
most
passionate
term
implore
her
compassion
;
to
which
Sophia
answer
:
"
sure
,
madam
,
it
be
surprize
you
should
be
so
very
strongly
interested
in
the
behalf
of
this

<EOS>
I
would
not
think

"
no
,
madam

"
say
Mrs
Miller
,
"
you
shall
not
think
anything
but
the
truth

<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
all
,
and
you
will
not
wonder
that
I
be
interested

<EOS>
He
be
the
best

natured
creature

"
 
<EOS>
She
then
begin
and
relate
the
story
of
Mr
Anderson
.
 
<EOS>
after
this
she
cry
,
"
this
,
madam
,
this
be
his
goodness
;
but
I
have
much
more
tender
obligation
to
him

<EOS>
He
hath
preserve
my

"
 
<EOS>
here
,
after
shed
some
tear
,
she
relate
everything
concern
that
fact
,
suppress
only
those
circumstance
which
would
have
most
reflect
on
her
daughter
,
and
conclude
with
say
,
"
now
,
madam
,
you
shall
judge
whether
I
can
ever
do
enough
for
so
kind
,
so
good

<EOS>
so
generous
a
young
man
;
and
sure
he
be
the
good

worthiest
of
all
human
being

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
alteration
in
the
countenance
of
Sophia
have
hitherto
be
chiefly
to
her
disadvantage
,
and
have
incline
her
complexion
to
too
great
paleness
;
but
she
now
wax
redder
,
if
possible
,
than
vermilion
,
and
cry
,
"
I
know
not
what
to
say
;
certainly
what
arise
from
gratitude
can
not
be
blame
 
but
<EOS>
what
service
can
my
reading
this
letter
do
your
friend
,
since
I
be
resolve
never
"
Mrs
Miller
fall
again
to
her
entreaty
,
and
beg
to
be
forgive
,
but
she
could
not
,
she
say
,
carry
it
back
.
"
<EOS>
well
,
madam
<EOS>
,
"
say
Sophia
,
"
I
can
not
help
it
,
if
you
will
force
it
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
certainly
you
may
leave
it
whether
I
will
or
no
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
Sophia
mean
,
or
whether
she
mean
anything
,
I
will
not
presume
to
determine
;
but
Mrs
Miller
actually
understand
this
as
a
hint
,
and
presently
lay
the
letter
down
on
the
table
,
take
her
leave
,
have
first
beg
permission
to
wait
again
on
Sophia
;
which
request
have
neither
assent
nor
denial
.
  
<EOS>
the
letter
lie
upon
the
table
no
longer
than
till
Mrs
Miller
be
out
of
sight
;
for
then
Sophia
open
and
read
it
.
  
<EOS>
this
letter
do
very
little
service
to
his
cause
;
for
it
consist
of
little
more
than
confession
of
his
own
unworthiness
,
and
bitter
lamentation
of
despair
,
together
with
the
most
solemn
protestation
of
his
unalterable
fidelity
to
Sophia
,
of
which
,
he
say
,
he
hope
to
convince
her
,
if
he
have
ever
more
the
honour
of
be
admit
to
her
presence
;
and
that
he
could
account
for
the
letter
to
Lady
Bellaston
in
such
a
manner
,
that
,
though
it
would
not
entitle
him
to
her
forgiveness
,
he
hope
at
least
to
obtain
it
from
her
mercy
.
<EOS>
and
conclude
with
vow
that
nothing
be
ever
less
in
his
thought
than
to
marry
Lady
Bellaston
.
  
<EOS>
though
Sophia
read
the
letter
twice
over
with
great
attention
,
his
meaning
still
remain
a
riddle
to
her
;
nor
could
her
invention
suggest
to
her
any
mean
to
excuse
Jones
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
remain
very
angry
with
him
,
though
indeed
Lady
Bellaston
take
up
so
much
of
her
resentment
,
that
her
gentle
mind
have
but
little
left
to
bestow
on
any
other
person
.
  
<EOS>
that
lady
be
most
unluckily
to
dine
this
very
day
with
her
aunt
Western
,
and
in
the
afternoon
they
be
all
three
,
by
appointment
,
to
go
together
to
the
opera
,
and
thence
to
Lady
Thomas
Hatchet
's
drum
.
<EOS>
Sophia
would
have
gladly
be
excuse
from
all
,
but
would
not
disoblige
her
aunt
;
and
as
to
the
art
of
counterfeit
illness
,
she
be
so
entirely
a
stranger
to
them
,
that
it
never
once
enter
into
her
head
.
<EOS>
when
she
be
dr
,
therefore
,
down
she
go
,
resolve
to
encounter
all
the
horror
of
the
day
,
and
a
most
disagreeable
one
it
prove
;
for
Lady
Bellaston
take
every
opportunity
very
civilly
and
slily
to
insult
her
;
to
all
which
her
dejection
of
spirit
disable
her
from
make
any
return
;
and
,
indeed
,
to
confess
the
truth
<EOS>
,
she
be
at
the
very
good
but
an
indifferent
mistress
of
repartee
.
  
<EOS>
another
misfortune
which
befel
poor
Sophia
be
the
company
of
Lord
Fellamar
,
whom
she
meet
at
the
opera
,
and
who
attend
her
to
the
drum
.
<EOS>
and
though
both
place
be
too
publick
to
admit
of
any
particularity
,
and
she
be
farther
relieve
by
the
musick
at
the
one
place
,
and
by
the
card
at
the
other
,
she
could
not
,
however
,
enjoy
herself
in
his
company
;
for
there
be
something
of
delicacy
in
woman
,
which
will
not
suffer
them
to
be
even
easy
in
the
presence
of
a
man
whom
they
know
to
have
pretension
to
them
which
they
be
disincline
to
favour
.
  
<EOS>
have
in
this
chapter
twice
mention
a
drum
,
a
word
which
our
posterity
,
it
be
hope
,
will
not
understand
in
the
sense
it
be
here
apply
,
we
shall
,
notwithstanding
our
present
haste
,
stop
a
moment
to
describe
the
entertainment
here
mean
,
and
the
rather
as
we
can
in
a
moment
describe
it
.
  
<EOS>
a
drum
,
then
,
be
an
assembly
of
well
-
dress
person
of
both
sex
,
most
of
whom
play
at
card
,
and
the
rest
do
nothing
at
all
;
while
the
mistress
of
the
house
perform
the
part
of
the
landlady
at
an
inn
,
and
like
the
landlady
of
an
inn
pride
herself
in
the
number
of
her
guest
,
though
she
doth
not
always
,
like
her
,
get
anything
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
no
wonder
then
,
as
so
much
spirit
must
be
require
to
support
any
vivacity
in
these
scene
of
dulness
,
that
we
hear
person
of
fashion
eternally
complain
of
the
want
of
them
;
a
complaint
confine
entirely
to
upper
life
.
<EOS>
how
insupportable
must
we
imagine
this
round
of
impertinence
to
have
be
to
Sophia
at
this
time
;
how
difficult
must
she
have
find
it
to
force
the
appearance
of
gaiety
into
her
look
,
when
her
mind
dictate
nothing
but
the
tender
sorrow
,
and
when
every
thought
be
charge
with
torment
idea
!
  
<EOS>
night
,
however
,
at
last
restore
her
to
her
pillow
,
where
we
will
leave
her
to
soothe
her
melancholy
at
least
,
though
incapable
<EOS>
we
fear
of
rest
,
and
shall
pursue
our
history
,
which
,
something
whisper
us
,
be
now
arrive
at
the
eve
of
some
great
event
.
    
<EOS>
a
pathetic
scene
between
Mr
Allworthy
and
Mrs
Miller
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Miller
have
a
long
discourse
with
Mr
Allworthy
,
at
his
return
from
dinner
,
in
which
she
acquaint
him
with
Jones
's
have
unfortunately
lose
all
which
he
be
pleased
to
bestow
on
him
at
their
separation
;
and
with
the
distress
to
which
that
loss
have
subject
him
;
of
all
which
she
have
receive
a
full
account
from
the
faithful
retailer
Partridge
.
<EOS>
She
then
explain
the
obligation
she
have
to
Jones
;
not
that
she
be
entirely
explicit
with
regard
to
her
daughter
;
for
though
she
have
the
utmost
confidence
in
Mr
Allworthy
,
and
though
there
could
be
no
hope
of
keep
an
affair
secret
which
be
unhappily
know
to
more
than
half
a
dozen
,
yet
she
could
not
prevail
with
herself
to
mention
those
circumstance
which
reflect
most
on
the
chastity
of
poor
Nancy
,
but
smother
that
part
of
her
evidence
as
cautiously
as
if
she
have
be
before
a
judge
,
and
the
girl
be
now
on
her
trial
for
the
murder
of
a
bastard
.
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
say
,
there
be
few
character
so
absolutely
vicious
as
not
to
have
the
least
mixture
of
good
in
them
.
"
<EOS>
however
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
can
not
deny
but
that
you
have
some
obligation
to
the
fellow
,
bad
as
he
be
,
and
I
shall
therefore
excuse
what
hath
past
already
,
but
must
insist
you
never
mention
his
name
to
me
more
;
for
,
I
promise
you
,
it
be
upon
the
full
and
plain
evidence
that
I
resolve
to
take
the
measure
I
have
take
.
"
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
make
not
the
least
doubt
but
time
will
shew
all
matter
in
their
true
and
natural
colour
,
and
that
you
will
be
convince
this
poor
young
man
deserve
well
of
you
than
some
other
folk
that
shall
be
nameless
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
cry
Allworthy
,
<EOS>
a
little
ruffled
,
"
I
will
not
hear
any
reflection
on
my
nephew
;
and
if
ever
you
say
a
word
more
of
that
kind
,
I
will
depart
from
your
house
that
instant
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
worthy
and
good
of
man
;
and
I
once
more
repeat
it
to
you
,
he
hath
carry
his
friendship
to
this
man
to
a
blameable
length
,
by
too
long
concealing
fact
of
the
black
die
.
<EOS>
the
ingratitude
of
the
wretch
to
this
good
young
man
be
what
I
most
resent
;
for
,
madam
,
I
have
the
great
reason
to
imagine
he
have
lay
a
plot
to
supplant
my
nephew
in
my
favour
,
and
to
have
disinherit
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
sir
,
"
answer
Mrs
Miller
,
a
little
frightened
(
for
,
though
Mr
Allworthy
have
the
utmost
sweetness
and
benevolence
in
his
smile
,
he
have
great
terror
in
his
frown
)
,
"
I
shall
never
speak
against
any
gentleman
you
be
pleased
to
think
well
of
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
sir
,
such
behaviour
would
very
little
become
me
,
especially
when
the
gentleman
be
your
near
relation
;
but
,
sir
,
you
must
not
be
angry
with
me
,
<EOS>
you
must
not
indeed
,
for
my
good
wish
to
this
poor
wretch
.
<EOS>
sure
I
may
call
him
so
now
,
though
once
you
would
have
be
angry
with
me
if
I
have
speak
of
him
with
the
least
disrespect
.
<EOS>
how
often
have
I
hear
you
call
him
your
son
?
<EOS>
how
often
have
you
prattle
to
me
of
him
with
all
the
fondness
of
a
parent
?
<EOS>
Nay
,
sir
,
I
can
not
forget
the
many
tender
expression
,
the
many
good
thing
you
have
tell
me
of
his
beauty
,
and
his
part
,
and
his
virtue
;
of
his
good
-
nature
and
generosity
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
sir
,
I
can
not
forget
them
,
for
I
find
them
all
true
.
<EOS>
I
have
experience
them
in
my
own
cause
.
<EOS>
They
have
preserve
my
family
.
<EOS>
You
must
pardon
my
tear
,
sir
,
indeed
you
must
.
<EOS>
when
I
consider
the
cruel
reverse
of
fortune
which
this
poor
youth
,
to
whom
I
be
so
much
oblige
,
hath
suffer
;
when
I
consider
the
loss
of
your
favour
,
which
I
know
he
value
more
than
his
life
,
I
must
,
I
must
lament
him
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
a
dagger
in
your
hand
,
ready
to
plunge
into
my
heart
,
I
must
lament
the
misery
of
one
whom
you
have
love
,
and
I
shall
ever
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
be
pretty
much
move
with
this
speech
,
but
it
seem
not
to
be
with
anger
;
for
,
after
a
short
silence
,
take
Mrs
Miller
by
the
hand
,
he
say
very
affectionately
to
her
,
"
come
,
madam
,
let
us
consider
a
little
about
your
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
blame
you
for
rejoice
in
a
match
which
promise
to
be
advantageous
to
her
,
but
you
know
this
advantage
,
in
a
great
measure
,
depend
on
the
father
's
reconciliation
.
<EOS>
I
know
Mr
Nightingale
very
well
,
and
have
formerly
have
concern
with
him
;
I
will
make
him
a
visit
,
and
endeavour
to
serve
you
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
be
a
worldly
man
;
but
as
this
be
an
only
son
,
and
the
thing
be
now
irretrievable
,
perhaps
he
may
in
time
be
bring
to
reason
.
<EOS>
I
promise
you
I
will
do
all
I
can
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
many
be
the
acknowledgment
which
the
poor
woman
make
to
Allworthy
for
this
kind
and
generous
offer
,
nor
could
she
refrain
from
take
this
occasion
again
to
express
her
gratitude
towards
Jones
,
"
to
whom
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
owe
the
opportunity
of
give
you
,
sir
,
this
present
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Allworthy
gently
stop
her
;
but
he
be
too
good
a
man
to
be
really
offend
with
the
effect
of
so
noble
a
principle
as
now
actuate
Mrs
Miller
;
and
indeed
,
have
not
this
new
affair
inflame
his
former
anger
against
Jones
,
it
be
possible
he
may
have
be
a
little
softened
towards
him
,
by
the
report
of
an
action
which
malice
itself
could
not
have
derive
from
an
evil
motive
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
and
Mrs
Miller
have
be
above
an
hour
together
,
when
their
conversation
be
put
an
end
to
by
the
arrival
of
Blifil
and
another
person
,
which
other
person
be
no
less
than
Mr
Dowling
,
the
attorney
,
who
be
now
become
a
great
favourite
with
Mr
Blifil
,
and
whom
Mr
Allworthy
,
at
the
desire
of
his
nephew
,
have
make
his
steward
;
and
have
likewise
recommend
him
to
Mr
Western
,
from
whom
the
attorney
receive
a
promise
of
be
promote
to
the
same
office
upon
the
first
vacancy
;
and
,
in
the
meantime
,
be
employ
in
transact
some
affair
which
the
squire
then
have
in
London
in
relation
to
a
mortgage
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
principal
affair
which
then
bring
Mr
Dowling
to
town
;
therefore
he
take
the
same
opportunity
to
charge
himself
with
some
money
for
Mr
Allworthy
,
and
to
make
a
report
to
him
of
some
other
business
;
in
all
which
,
as
it
be
of
much
too
dull
a
nature
to
find
any
place
in
this
history
,
we
will
leave
the
uncle
,
nephew
,
and
their
lawyer
concern
,
and
resort
to
other
matter
.
    
<EOS>
contain
various
matter
.
 
<EOS>
before
we
return
to
Mr
Jones
,
we
will
take
one
more
view
of
Sophia
.
  
<EOS>
though
that
young
lady
have
bring
her
aunt
into
great
good
humour
by
those
soothing
method
which
we
have
before
relate
,
she
have
not
bring
her
in
the
least
to
abate
of
her
zeal
for
the
match
with
Lord
Fellamar
.
<EOS>
this
zeal
be
now
inflame
by
Lady
Bellaston
,
who
have
tell
her
the
precede
evening
,
that
she
be
well
satisfied
from
the
conduct
of
Sophia
,
and
from
her
carriage
to
his
lordship
,
that
all
delay
would
be
dangerous
,
and
that
the
only
way
to
succeed
be
to
press
the
match
forward
with
such
rapidity
that
the
young
lady
should
have
no
time
to
reflect
,
and
be
oblige
to
consent
while
she
scarce
know
what
she
do
;
in
which
manner
,
she
say
,
one
-
half
of
the
marriage
among
people
of
condition
be
bring
about
.
<EOS>
a
fact
very
probably
true
,
and
to
which
,
I
suppose
,
be
owe
the
mutual
tenderness
which
afterwards
exist
among
so
many
happy
couple
.
  
<EOS>
a
hint
of
the
same
kind
be
give
by
the
same
lady
to
Lord
Fellamar
;
and
both
these
so
readily
embrace
the
advice
that
the
very
next
day
be
,
at
his
lordship
's
request
,
appoint
by
Mrs
Western
for
a
private
interview
between
the
young
party
.
<EOS>
this
be
communicate
to
Sophia
by
her
aunt
,
and
insist
upon
in
such
high
term
,
that
,
after
have
urge
everything
she
possibly
could
invent
against
it
without
the
least
effect
,
she
at
last
agree
to
give
the
high
instance
of
complacence
which
any
young
lady
can
give
,
and
consent
to
see
his
lordship
.
  
<EOS>
as
conversation
of
this
kind
afford
no
great
entertainment
,
we
shall
be
excuse
from
recite
the
whole
that
past
at
this
interview
;
in
which
,
after
his
lordship
have
make
many
declaration
of
the
most
pure
and
ardent
passion
to
the
silent
blush
Sophia
,
she
at
last
collect
all
the
spirit
she
could
raise
,
and
with
a
tremble
low
voice
say
,
"
My
lord
,
you
must
be
yourself
conscious
whether
your
former
behaviour
to
me
hath
be
consistent
with
the
profession
you
now
make
.
"
<EOS>
"
be
there
,
"
answer
he
,
"
no
way
by
which
I
can
atone
for
madness
?
<EOS>
what
I
do
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
must
have
too
plainly
convinced
you
,
that
the
violence
of
love
have
deprive
me
of
my
sense
.
"
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
my
lord
,
"
say
she
,
"
it
be
in
your
power
to
give
me
a
proof
of
an
affection
which
I
much
rather
wish
to
encourage
,
and
to
which
I
should
think
myself
more
beholden
.
"
<EOS>
"
name
it
,
madam
,
"
say
my
lord
,
very
warmly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
lord
,
"
say
she
,
look
down
upon
her
fan
,
"
I
know
you
must
be
sensible
how
uneasy
this
pretended
passion
of
yours
hath
make
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
Can
you
be
so
cruel
to
call
it
pretend
?
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
my
lord
,
"
answer
Sophia
,
"
all
profession
of
love
to
those
whom
we
persecute
be
most
insulting
pretence
.
<EOS>
this
pursuit
of
yours
be
to
me
a
most
cruel
persecution
:
nay
,
it
be
take
a
most
ungenerous
advantage
of
my
unhappy
situation
.
"
<EOS>
"
most
lovely
,
most
adorable
charmer
,
do
not
accuse
me
,
"
cry
he
,
"
of
take
an
ungenerous
advantage
,
while
I
have
no
thought
<EOS>
but
what
be
direct
to
your
honour
and
interest
,
and
while
I
have
no
view
,
no
hope
,
no
ambition
,
but
to
throw
myself
,
honour
,
fortune
,
everything
at
your
foot
.
"
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
say
she
,
"
it
be
that
fortune
and
those
honour
which
give
you
the
advantage
of
which
I
complain
.
<EOS>
these
be
the
charm
which
have
seduce
my
relation
,
but
to
me
they
be
thing
indifferent
.
<EOS>
if
your
lordship
will
merit
my
gratitude
,
there
be
but
one
way
.
"
<EOS>
"
pardon
me
,
divine
creature
,
"
say
he
,
"
there
can
be
none
.
<EOS>
all
I
can
do
for
you
be
so
much
your
due
,
and
will
give
me
so
much
pleasure
,
that
there
be
no
room
for
your
gratitude
.
"
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
my
lord
,
"
answer
she
,
"
you
may
obtain
my
gratitude
,
my
good
opinion
,
every
kind
thought
and
wish
which
it
be
in
my
power
to
bestow
;
nay
<EOS>
,
you
may
obtain
them
with
ease
,
for
sure
to
a
generous
mind
it
must
be
easy
to
grant
my
request
.
<EOS>
let
me
beseech
you
,
then
,
to
cease
a
pursuit
in
which
you
can
never
have
any
success
.
<EOS>
for
your
own
sake
as
well
as
mine
I
entreat
this
favour
;
for
sure
you
be
too
noble
to
have
any
pleasure
in
torment
an
unhappy
creature
.
<EOS>
what
can
your
lordship
propose
but
uneasiness
to
yourself
,
by
a
perseverance
,
which
,
upon
my
honour
,
upon
my
soul
,
can
not
,
shall
not
prevail
with
me
,
whatever
distress
you
may
drive
me
to
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
my
lord
fetch
a
deep
sigh
,
and
then
say
 
"
be
it
then
,
madam
,
that
I
be
so
unhappy
to
be
the
object
of
your
dislike
and
scorn
;
or
will
you
pardon
me
if
I
suspect
there
be
some
other
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
he
hesitate
,
and
Sophia
answer
with
some
spirit
,
"
My
lord
,
I
shall
not
be
accountable
to
you
for
the
reason
of
my
conduct
.
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
your
lordship
for
the
generous
offer
you
have
make
;
I
own
it
be
beyond
either
my
desert
or
expectation
;
yet
I
hope
,
my
lord
,
you
will
not
insist
on
my
reason
,
when
I
declare
I
can
not
accept
it
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Fellamar
return
much
to
this
,
which
we
do
not
perfectly
understand
,
and
perhaps
it
could
not
all
be
strictly
reconcile
either
to
sense
or
grammar
;
but
he
conclude
his
rant
speech
with
say
,
"
that
if
she
have
pre
-
engage
herself
to
any
gentleman
,
however
unhappy
it
would
make
him
,
he
should
think
himself
bind
in
honour
to
desist
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
my
lord
lay
too
much
emphasis
on
the
word
gentleman
;
for
we
can
not
else
well
account
for
the
indignation
with
which
he
inspire
Sophia
,
who
,
in
her
answer
,
seem
greatly
to
resent
some
affront
he
have
give
her
.
  
<EOS>
while
she
be
speak
,
with
her
voice
more
raise
than
usual
,
Mrs
Western
come
into
the
room
,
the
fire
glare
in
her
cheek
,
and
the
flame
burst
from
her
eye
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
ashamed
,
"
say
she
,
"
my
lord
,
of
the
reception
which
you
have
meet
with
.
<EOS>
I
assure
your
lordship
we
be
all
sensible
of
the
honour
do
us
;
and
I
must
tell
you
,
Miss
Western
,
the
family
expect
a
different
behaviour
from
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
my
lord
interfere
on
behalf
of
the
young
lady
,
but
to
no
purpose
;
the
aunt
proceed
till
Sophia
pull
out
her
handkerchief
,
throw
herself
into
a
chair
,
and
burst
into
a
violent
fit
of
tear
.
  
<EOS>
the
remainder
of
the
conversation
between
Mrs
Western
and
his
lordship
,
till
the
latter
withdraw
,
consist
of
bitter
lamentation
on
his
side
,
and
on
her
of
the
strong
assurance
that
her
niece
should
and
would
consent
to
all
he
wish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
my
lord
,
"
say
she
,
"
the
girl
hath
have
a
foolish
education
,
neither
adapt
to
her
fortune
nor
her
family
.
<EOS>
Her
father
,
I
be
sorry
to
say
it
,
be
to
blame
for
everything
.
<EOS>
the
girl
hath
silly
country
notion
of
bashfulness
.
<EOS>
nothing
else
,
my
lord
,
upon
my
honour
;
I
be
convince
she
hath
a
good
understanding
at
the
bottom
,
and
will
be
bring
to
reason
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
last
speech
be
make
in
the
absence
of
Sophia
;
for
she
have
some
time
before
leave
the
room
,
with
more
appearance
of
passion
than
she
have
ever
show
on
any
occasion
;
and
now
his
lordship
,
after
many
expression
of
thank
to
Mrs
Western
,
many
ardent
profession
of
passion
which
nothing
could
conquer
,
and
many
assurance
of
perseverance
,
which
Mrs
Western
highly
encouraged
,
take
his
leave
for
this
time
.
  
<EOS>
before
we
relate
what
now
pass
between
Mrs
Western
and
Sophia
,
it
may
be
proper
to
mention
an
unfortunate
accident
which
have
happen
,
and
which
have
occasion
the
return
of
Mrs
Western
with
so
much
fury
,
as
we
have
see
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
then
must
know
that
the
maid
who
at
present
attend
on
Sophia
be
recommend
by
Lady
Bellaston
,
with
whom
she
have
live
for
some
time
in
the
capacity
of
a
comb
-
brush
:
she
be
a
very
sensible
girl
,
and
have
receive
the
strict
instruction
to
watch
her
young
lady
very
carefully
.
<EOS>
these
instruction
,
we
be
sorry
to
say
,
be
communicate
to
her
by
Mrs
Honour
,
into
whose
favour
Lady
Bellaston
have
now
so
ingratiate
herself
,
that
the
violent
affection
which
the
good
waiting
-
woman
have
formerly
bear
to
Sophia
be
entirely
obliterate
by
that
great
attachment
which
she
have
to
her
new
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
when
Mrs
Miller
be
depart
,
Betty
(
for
that
be
the
name
of
the
girl
)
,
return
to
her
young
lady
,
find
her
very
attentively
engage
in
read
a
long
letter
,
and
the
visible
emotion
which
she
betray
on
that
occasion
may
have
well
account
for
some
suspicion
which
the
girl
entertain
;
but
indeed
they
have
yet
a
strong
foundation
,
for
she
have
overhear
the
whole
scene
which
pass
between
Sophia
and
Mrs
Miller
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Western
be
acquaint
with
all
this
matter
by
Betty
,
who
,
after
receive
many
commendation
and
some
reward
for
her
fidelity
,
be
order
,
that
,
if
the
woman
who
bring
the
letter
come
again
,
she
should
introduce
her
to
Mrs
Western
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Unluckily
,
Mrs
Miller
return
at
the
very
time
when
Sophia
be
engage
with
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
Betty
,
accord
to
order
,
send
her
directly
to
the
aunt
;
who
,
be
mistress
of
so
many
circumstance
relate
to
what
have
past
the
day
before
,
easily
impose
upon
the
poor
woman
to
believe
that
Sophia
have
communicate
the
whole
affair
;
and
so
pump
everything
out
of
her
which
she
know
relate
to
the
letter
and
relate
to
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
this
poor
creature
may

She

everything
which

to

<EOS>
Mrs
Western
,
have
drain
Mrs
Miller
of
all
she
know
,
which
,
indeed
,
be
but
little
,
but
which
be
sufficient
to
make
the
aunt
suspect
a
great
deal
,
dismiss
her
with
assurance
that
Sophia
would
not
see
her
,
that
she
would
send
no

to
the
letter

lecture
on
the

of
an
office

<EOS>
this

the

Sophia
very
warmly
protest
against

<EOS>
at
which

and
she
rush
in
upon
her
niece
in
a
most
furious
manner
,
as
we
have
already
describe
,
together
with
what
past
at
that
time
till
his
lordship
's
departure

<EOS>
no
sooner
be
<EOS>
Lord
Fellamar
go
than
Mrs

return
to
Sophia
,
whom
she
upbraid
in
the
most
bitter
term
for
the
ill
use
she
have
make
of
the
confidence
repose
in
her

and
for
her
treachery
in
converse
with
a
man
with
whom
she
have
offer
but
<EOS>
the
day
before
to
bind
herself
in
the
most
solemn
oath
never

<EOS>
Sophia
protest
she
have
maintain
no
such
conversation

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
,
how
!
<EOS>
Miss
Western
,
"
say
the
aunt
;
"
will
you
deny
your
receive
a
letter
from
him
yesterday
?
"
<EOS>
"
a
letter
,
madam
!
"
<EOS>
answer
Sophia
,
somewhat
surprized
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
very
well
breed
,
miss
,
"
reply
the
aunt
,
"
to
repeat
my
word
.
<EOS>
I
say
a
letter
,
and
I
insist
upon
your
show
it
me
immediately
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
scorn
a
lie
,
madam
,
"
say
Sophia
;
"
I
do
receive
a
letter
,
but
it
be
without
my
desire
,
and
,
indeed
,
I
may
say
,
against
my
consent
.
"
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
indeed
,
miss
,
"
cry
the
aunt
,
"
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
own
you
have
receive
it
at
all
;
but
where
be
the
letter
?
<EOS>
for
I
will
see
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
to
this
peremptory
demand
,
Sophia
pause
some
time
before
she
return
an
answer
;
and
at
last
only
excuse
herself
by
declare
she
have
not
the
letter
in
her
pocket
,
which
be
,
indeed
,
true
;
upon
which
her
aunt
,
lose
all
manner
of
patience
,
ask
her
niece
this
short
question
,
whether
she
would
resolve
to
marry
Lord
Fellamar
,
or
no
?
<EOS>
to
which
she
receive
the
strong
negative
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Western
then
reply
with
an
oath
,
or
something
very
like
one
,
that
she
would
early
the
next
morning
deliver
her
back
into
her
father
's
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
then
begin
to
reason
with
her
aunt
in
the
follow
manner
:
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
madam
,
must
I
of
necessity
be
force
to
marry
at
all
?
<EOS>
consider
how
cruel
you
would
have
think
it
in
your
own
case
,
and
how
much
kind
your
parent
be
in
leave
you
to
your
liberty
.
<EOS>
what
have
I
do
to
forfeit
this
liberty
?
<EOS>
I
will
never
marry
contrary
to
my
father
's
consent
,
nor
without
ask
yours
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
ask
the
consent
of
either
improperly
,
it
will
be
then
time
enough
to
force
some
other
marriage
upon
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
Can
I
bear
to
hear
this
,
"
cry
Mrs
Western
,
"
from
a
girl
who
hath
now
a
letter
from
a
murderer
in
her
pocket
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
such
letter
<EOS>
,
I
promise
you
,
"
answer
Sophia
;
"
and
,
if
he
be
a
murderer
,
he
will
soon
be
in
no
condition
to
give
you
any
further
disturbance
.
"
<EOS>
"
how
,
Miss
Western
!
"
say
the
aunt
,
"
have
you
the
assurance
to
speak
of
him
in
this
manner
;
to
own
your
affection
for
such
a
villain
to
my
face
?
"
<EOS>
"
sure
,
madam
,
"
say
Sophia
,
"
you
put
a
very
strange
construction
on
my
word
.
"
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
Miss
Western
,
"
cry
the
lady
,
"
I
shall
not
bear
this
usage
;
you
have
learn
of
your
father
this
manner
of
treat
me
<EOS>
;
he
hath
teach
you
to
give
me
the
lie
.
<EOS>
He
hath
totally
ruin
you
by
this
false
system
of
education
;
and
,
please
heaven
,
he
shall
have
the
comfort
of
its
fruit
;
for
once
more
I
declare
to
you
,
that
to

morrow
morning
I
will
carry
you
back
.
<EOS>
I
will
withdraw
all
my
force
from
the
field
,
and
remain
henceforth
,
like
the
wise
king
of
Prussia
,
in
a
state
of
perfect
neutrality
.
<EOS>
You
be
both
too
wise
to
be
regulate
by
my
measure
;
so
prepare
yourself
,
for
to
-
morrow
morning
you
shall
evacuate
this
house
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sophia
remonstrate
all
she
could
;
but
her
aunt
be
deaf
to
all
she
say
.
<EOS>
in
this
resolution
therefore
we
must
at
present
leave
her
,
as
there
seem
to
be
no
hope
of
bring
her
to
change
it
.
    
<EOS>
what
happen
to
Mr
Jones
in
the
prison
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jones
pass
about
twenty
-
four
melancholy
hour
by
himself
,
unless
when
relieve
by
the
company
of
Partridge
,
before
Mr
Nightingale
return
;
not
that
this
worthy
young
man
have
desert
or
forget
his
friend
;
for
,
indeed
,
he
have
be
much
the
great
part
of
the
time
employ
in
his
service
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
hear
,
upon
enquiry
,
that
the
only
person
who
have
see
the
beginning
of
the
unfortunate
rencounter
be
a
crew
belong
to
a
man
-
of
-
war
which
then
lie
at
Deptford
.
<EOS>
to
Deptford
therefore
he
go
in
search
of
this
crew
,
where
he
be
inform
that
the
man
he
seek
after
be
all
go
ashore
.
<EOS>
He
then
trace
them
from
place
to
place
,
till
at
last
he
find
two
of
them
drink
together
,
with
a
third
person
,
at
a
hedge
-
tavern
near
Aldersgate
.
  
<EOS>
Nightingale
desire
to
speak
with
Jones
by
himself
(
for
Partridge
be
in
the
room
when
he
come
in
)
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
be
alone
,
Nightingale
,
take
Jones
by
the
hand
,
cry
,
"
come
,
my
brave
friend
,
be
not
too
much
dejected
at
what
I
be
go
to
tell
you
 
I
be
sorry
I
be
the
messenger
of
bad
news
;
but
I
think
it
my
duty
to
tell
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
guess
already
what
that
bad
news
be
,
"
cry
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
the
poor
gentleman
then
be
dead
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
"
answer
Nightingale
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
alive
this
morning
;
though
I
will
not
flatter
you
;
I
fear
,
from
the
account
I
could
get
,
that
his
wound
be
mortal
.
<EOS>
but
if
the
affair
be
exactly
as
you
tell
it
,
your
own
remorse
would
be
all
you
would
have
reason
to
apprehend
,
let
what
would
happen
;
but
forgive
me
,
my
dear
Tom
,
if
I
entreat
you
to
make
the
bad
of
your
story
to
your
friend
.
<EOS>
if
you
disguise
anything
to
us
,
you
will
only
be
an
enemy
to
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
reason
,
my
dear
Jack
,
have
I
ever
give
you
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
to
stab
me
with
so
cruel
a
suspicion
?
"
<EOS>
"
have
patience
,
"
cry
Nightingale
,
"
and
I
will
tell
you
all
.
<EOS>
after
the
most
diligent
enquiry
I
could
make
,
I
at
last
meet
with
two
of
the
fellow
who
be
present
at
this
unhappy
accident
,
and
I
be
sorry
to
say
,
they
do
not
relate
the
story
so
much
in
your
favour
as
you
yourself
have
tell
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
what
do
they
say
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
indeed
what
I
be
sorry
to
repeat
,
as
I
be
afraid
of
the
consequence
of
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
They
say
that
they
be
at
too
great
a
distance
to
overhear
any
word
that
pass
between
you
:
but
they
both
agree
that
the
first
blow
be
give
by
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
then
,
upon
my
soul
,
"
answer
Jones
,
"
they
injure
me
.
<EOS>
He
not
only
strike
me
first
,
but
strike
me
without
the
least
provocation
.
<EOS>
what
should
induce
those
villain
to
accuse
me
falsely
?
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
that
I
can
not
guess
,
"
say
Nightingale
,
"
and
if
you
yourself
,
and
I
,
who
be
so
heartily
your
friend
,
can
not
conceive
a
reason
why
they
should
belie
you
,
what
reason
will
an
indifferent
court
of
justice
be
able
to
assign
why
they
should
not
believe
them
?
<EOS>
I
repeat
the
question
to
them
several
time
,
and
so
do
another
gentleman
who
be
present
,
who
,
I
believe
,
be
a
seafare
man
,
and
who
really
act
a
very
friendly
part
by
you
;
for
he
beg
them
often
to
consider
that
there
be
the
life
of
a
man
in
the
case
;
and
ask
them
over
and
over
,
if
they
be
certain
;
to
which
they
both
answer
,
that
they
be
,
and
would
abide
by
their
evidence
upon
oath
.
<EOS>
for
heaven
's
sake
,
my
dear
friend
,
recollect
yourself
;
for
,
if
this
should
appear
to
be
the
fact
,
it
will
be
your
business
to
think
in
time
of
make
the
good
of
your
interest
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
shock
you
;
but
you
know
,
I
believe
,
the
severity
of
the
law
,
whatever
verbal
provocation
may
have
be
give
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
alas
!
my
friend
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
what
interest
hath
such
a
wretch
as
I
?
<EOS>
besides
,
do
you
think
I
would
even
wish
to
live
with
the
reputation
of
a
murderer
?
<EOS>
if
I
have
any
friend
(
as
,
alas
!
<EOS>
I
have
none
)
,
could
I
have
the
confidence
to
solicit
them
to
speak
in
the
behalf
of
a
man
condemn
for
the
black
crime
in
human
nature
?
<EOS>
believe
me
,
I
have
no
such
hope
;
but
I
have
some
reliance
on
a
throne
still
greatly
superior
;
<EOS>
which
will
,
I
be
certain
,
afford
me
all
the
protection
I
merit
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
then
conclude
with
many
solemn
and
vehement
protestation
of
the
truth
of
what
he
have
at
first
assert
.
  
<EOS>
the
faith
of
Nightingale
be
now
again
stagger
,
and
begin
to
incline
to
credit
his
friend
,
when
Mrs
Miller
appear
,
and
make
a
sorrowful
report
of
the
success
of
her
embassy
;
which
when
Jones
have
hear
,
he
cry
out
most
heroically
,
"
well
,
my
friend
,
I
be
now
indifferent
as
to
what
shall
happen
,
at
least
with
regard
to
my
life
;
and
if
it
be
the
will
of
Heaven
that
I
shall
make
an
atonement
with
that
for
the
blood
I
have
spill
,
I
hope
the
Divine
Goodness
will
one
day
suffer
my
honour
to
be
clear
,
and
that
the
word
of
a
die
man
,
at
least
,
will
be
believe
,
so
far
as
to
justify
his
character
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
very
mournful
scene
now
past
between
the
prisoner
and
his
friend
,
at
which
,
as
few
reader
would
have
be
pleased
to
be
present
,
so
few
,
I
believe
,
will
desire
to
hear
it
particularly
relate
.
<EOS>
We
will
,
therefore
,
pass
on
to
the
entrance
of
the
turnkey
,
who
acquaint
Jones
that
there
be
a
lady
without
who
desire
to
speak
with
him
when
he
be
at
leisure
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
declare
his
surprize
at
this
message
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
"
He
know
no
lady
in
the
world
whom
he
could
possibly
expect
to
see
there
.
"
<EOS>
however
,
as
he
see
no
reason
to
decline
see
any
person
,
Mrs
Miller
and
Mr
Nightingale
presently
take
their
leave
,
and
he
give
order
to
have
the
lady
admit
.
  
<EOS>
if
Jones
be
surprize
at
the
news
of
a
visit
from
a
lady
,
how
greatly
be
he
astonish
when
he
discover
this
lady
to
be
no
other
than
Mrs
Waters
!
<EOS>
in
this
astonishment
then
we
shall
leave
him
awhile
,
in
order
to
cure
the
surprize
of
the
reader
,
who
will
likewise
,
probably
,
not
a
little
wonder
at
the
arrival
of
this
lady
.
  
<EOS>
who
this
Mrs
Waters
be
,
the
reader
pretty
well
know
;
what
she
be
,
he
must
be
perfectly
satisfied
.
<EOS>
He
will
therefore
be
pleased
to
remember
that
this
lady
depart
from
Upton
in
the
same
coach
with
Mr
Fitzpatrick
and
the
other
irish
gentleman
,
and
in
their
company
travel
to
Bath
.
  
<EOS>
now
there
be
a
certain
office
in
the
gift
of
Mr
Fitzpatrick
at
that
time
vacant
,
namely
that
of
a
wife
:
for
the
lady
who
have
lately
fill
that
office
have
resign
,
or
at
least
desert
her
duty
.
<EOS>
Mr
Fitzpatrick
therefore
,
have
thoroughly
examine
Mrs
Waters
on
the
road
,
find
her
extremely
fit
for
the
place
,
which
,
on
their
arrival
at
Bath
,
he
presently
confer
upon
her
,
and
she
without
any
scruple
accept
.
<EOS>
as
husband
and
wife
this
gentleman
and
lady
continue
together
all
the
time
they
stay
at
Bath
,
and
as
husband
and
wife
they
arrive
together
in
town
.
  
<EOS>
whether
Mr
Fitzpatrick
be
so
wise
<EOS>
a
man
as
not
to
part
with
one
good
thing
till
he
have
secure
another
,
which
he
have
at
present
only
a
prospect
of
regain
;
or
whether
Mrs
Waters
have
so
well
discharge
her
office
,
that
he
intend
still
to
retain
her
as
principal
,
and
to
make
his
wife
(
as
be
often
the
case
)
<EOS>
only
her
deputy
,
I
will
not
say
;
but
certain
it
be
,
he
never
mention
his
wife
to
her
,
never
communicate
to
her
the
letter
give
him
by
Mrs
Western
,
nor
ever
once
hint
his
purpose
of
repossess
his
wife
;
much
less
do
he
ever
mention
the
name
of
Jones
.
<EOS>
for
,
though
he
intend
to
fight
with
him
wherever
he
meet
him
,
he
do
not
imitate
those
prudent
person
who
think
a
wife
,
a
mother
,
a
sister
,
or
sometimes
a
whole
family
,
the
safe
second
on
these
occasion
.
<EOS>
the
first
account
therefore
which
she
have
of
all
this
be
deliver
to
her
from
his
lip
,
after
he
be
bring
home
from
the
tavern
where
his
wound
have
be
dr
.
  
<EOS>
as
Mr
Fitzpatrick
,
however
,
have
not
the
clear
way
of
tell
a
story
at
any
time
,
and
be
now
,
perhaps
,
a
little
more
confused
than
usual
,
it
be
some
time
before
she
discover
that
the
gentleman
who
have
give
him
this
wound
be
the
very
same
person
from
whom
her
heart
have
receive
a
wound
,
which
,
though
not
of
a
mortal
kind
,
be
yet
so
deep
that
it
have
leave
a
considerable
scar
behind
it
.
<EOS>
but
no
sooner
be
she
acquaint
that
Mr
Jones
himself
be
the
man
who
have
be
commit
to
the
Gatehouse
for
this
suppose
murder
,
than
she
take
the
first
opportunity
of
commit
Mr
Fitzpatrick
to
the
care
of
his
nurse
,
and
hasten
away
to
visit
the
conqueror
.
  
<EOS>
She
now
enter
the
room
with
an
air
of
gaiety
,
which
receive
an
immediate
check
from
the
melancholy
aspect
of
poor
Jones
,
who
start
and
bless
himself
when
he
see
her
.
<EOS>
upon
which
she
say
,
"
nay
,
I
do
not
wonder
at
your
surprize
;
I
believe
you
do
not
expect
to
see
me
;
for
few
gentleman
be
trouble
here
with
visit
from
any
lady
,
unless
a
wife
.
<EOS>
You
see
the
power
you
have
over
me
,
Mr
Jones
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
little
think
,
when
we
part
at
Upton
,
that
our
next
meeting
would
have
be
in
such
a
place
.
"
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
madam
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
I
must
look
upon
this
visit
as
kind
;
few
will
follow
the
miserable
,
especially
to
such
dismal
habitation
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
protest
,
Mr
Jones
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
can
hardly
persuade
myself
you
be
the
same
agreeable
fellow
I
see
at
Upton
.
<EOS>
why
,
your
face
be
more
miserable
than
any
dungeon
in
the
universe
.
<EOS>
what
can
be
the
matter
with
you
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
madam
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
<EOS>
as
you
know
of
my
being
here
,
you
know
the
unhappy
reason
.
"
<EOS>
"
pugh
!
"
say
she
,
"
you
have
pink
a
man
in
a
duel
,
that
be
all
.
"
<EOS>
Jones
exprest
some
indignation
at
this
levity
,
and
speak
with
the
utmost
contrition
for
what
have
happen
.
<EOS>
to
which
she
answer
,
"
well
,
then
,
sir
,
if
you
take
it
so
much
to
heart
,
I
will
relieve
you
;
the
gentleman
be
not
dead
,
and
,
I
be
pretty
confident
,
be
in
no
danger
of
die
.
<EOS>
the
surgeon
,
indeed
,
who
first
dress
him
be
a
young
fellow
,
and
seem
desirous
of
represent
his
case
to
be
as
bad
as
possible
,
that
he
may
have
the
more
honour
from
cure
him
:
but
the
king
's
surgeon
hath
see
him
since
,
and
say
,
unless
from
a
fever
,
of
which
there
be
at
present
no
symptom
,
he
apprehend
not
the
least
danger
of
life
.
"
<EOS>
Jones
shew
great
satisfaction
in
his
countenance
at
this
report
;
upon
which
she
affirm
the
truth
of
it
,
add
,
"
by
the
most
extraordinary
accident
in
the
world
I
lodge
at
the
same
house
;
and
have
see
the
gentleman
,
and
I
promise
you
he
doth
you
justice
,
and
say
,
whatever
be
the
consequence
,
that
he
be
entirely
the
aggressor
,
and
that
you
be
not
in
the
least
to
blame
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
express
the
utmost
satisfaction
at
the
account
which
Mrs
Waters
bring
him
.
<EOS>
He
then
inform
her
of
many
thing
which
she
well
know
before
,
as
who
Mr
Fitzpatrick
be
,
the
occasion
of
his
resentment
,
&
<EOS>
c.
He
likewise
tell
her
several
fact
of
which
she
be
ignorant
,
as
the
adventure
of
the
muff
,
and
other
particular
,
conceal
only
the
name
of
Sophia
.
<EOS>
He
then
lament
the
folly
and
vice
of
which
he
have
be
guilty
;
every
one
of
which
,
he
say
,
have
be
attend
with
such
ill
consequence
,
that
he
should
be
unpardonable
if
he
do
not
take
warning
,
and
quit
those
vicious
course
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
He
lastly
conclude
with
assure
her
of
his
resolution
to
sin
no
more
,
lest
a
bad
thing
should
happen
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Waters
with
great
pleasantry
ridicule
all
this
,
as
the
effect
of
low
spirit
and
confinement
.
<EOS>
She
repeat
some
witticism
about
the
devil
when
he
be
sick
,
and
tell
him
,
"
She
doubt
not
but
shortly
to
see
him
at
liberty
,
and
as
lively
a
fellow
as
ever
;
and
then
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
do
not
question
but
your
conscience
will
be
safely
deliver
of
all
these
qualm
that
it
be
now
so
sick
in
breed
.
"
  
<EOS>
many
more
thing
of
this
kind
she
utter
,
some
of
which
it
would
do
her
no
great
honour
,
in
the
opinion
of
some
reader
,
to
remember
;
nor
be
we
quite
certain
but
that
the
answer
make
by
Jones
would
be
treat
with
ridicule
by
other
.
<EOS>
We
shall
therefore
suppress
the
rest
of
this
conversation
,
and
only
observe
that
it
end
at
last
with
perfect
innocence
,
and
much
more
to
the
satisfaction
of
Jones
than
of
the
lady
;
for
the
former
be
greatly
transport
with
the
news
she
have
bring
him
;
but
the
latter
be
not
altogether
so
pleased
with
the
penitential
behaviour
of
a
man
whom
she
have
,
at
her
first
interview
,
conceive
a
very
different
opinion
of
from
what
she
now
entertain
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
thus
the
melancholy
occasion
by
the
report
of
Mr
Nightingale
be
pretty
well
effaced
;
but
the
dejection
into
which
Mrs
Miller
have
throw
him
still
continue
.
<EOS>
the
account
she
give
so
well
tallied
with
the
word
of
Sophia
herself
in
her
letter
,
that
he
make
not
the
least
doubt
but
that
she
have
disclose
his
letter
to
her
aunt
,
and
have
take
a
fix
resolution
to
abandon
him
.
<EOS>
the
torment
this
thought
give
him
be
to
be
equal
only
by
a
piece
of
news
which
fortune
have
yet
in
store
for
him
,
and
which
we
shall
communicate
in
the
second
chapter
of
the
ensue
book
.
  
<EOS>
book
XVIII
.
  
<EOS>
contain
about
six
day
.
    
<EOS>
a
farewel
to
the
reader
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
now
,
reader
,
arrive
at
the
last
stage
of
our
long
journey
.
<EOS>
as
we
have
,
therefore
,
travel
together
through
so
many
page
,
let
us
behave
to
one
another
like
fellow
-
traveller
in
a
stage
coach
,
who
have
pass
several
day
in
the
company
of
each
other
;
and
who
,
notwithstanding
any
bickering
or
little
animosity
which
may
have
occur
on
the
road
,
generally
make
all
up
at
last
,
and
mount
,
for
the
last
time
,
into
their
vehicle
with
chearfulness
and
good
humour
;
since
after
this
one
stage
,
it
may
possibly
happen
to
us
,
as
it
commonly
happen
to
them
,
never
to
meet
more
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
have
here
take
up
this
simile
,
give
me
leave
to
carry
it
a
little
farther
.
<EOS>
I
intend
,
then
,
in
this
last
book
,
to
imitate
the
good
company
I
have
mention
in
their
last
journey
.
<EOS>
now
,
it
be
well
known
that
all
joke
and
raillery
be
at
this
time
lay
aside
;
whatever
character
any
of
the
passenger
have
for
the
jest
-
sake
personate
on
the
road
be
now
throw
off
,
and
the
conversation
be
usually
plain
and
serious
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
same
manner
,
if
I
have
now
and
then
,
in
the
course
of
this
work
,
indulge
any
pleasantry
for
thy
entertainment
,
I
shall
here
lay
it
down
.
<EOS>
the
variety
of
matter
,
indeed
,
which
I
shall
be
oblige
to
cram
into
this
book
,
will
afford
no
room
for
any
of
those
ludicrous
observation
which
I
have
elsewhere
make
,
and
which
may
sometimes
,
perhaps
,
have
prevent
thee
from
take
a
nap
when
it
be
begin
to
steal
upon
thee
.
<EOS>
in
this
last
book
thou
wilt
find
nothing
(
or
at
most
very
little
)
of
that
nature
.
<EOS>
all
will
be
plain
narrative
only
;
and
,
indeed
,
when
thou
hast
peruse
the
many
great
event
which
this
book
will
produce
,
thou
wilt
think
the
number
of
page
contain
in
it
scarce
sufficient
to
tell
the
story
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
my
friend
,
I
take
this
opportunity
(
as
I
shall
have
no
other
)
of
heartily
wish
thee
well
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
an
entertaining
companion
to
thee
,
I
promise
thee
<EOS>
it
be
what
I
have
desire
.
<EOS>
if
in
anything
I
have
offend
,
it
be
really
without
any
intention
.
<EOS>
some
thing
,
perhaps
,
here
say
,
may
have
hit
thee
or
thy
friend
;
but
I
do
most
solemnly
declare
they
be
not
point
at
thee
or
them
.
<EOS>
I
question
not
but
thou
hast
be
tell
,
among
other
story
of
me
,
that
thou
wast
to
travel
with
a
very
scurrilous
fellow
;
but
whoever
tell
thee
so
do
me
an
injury
.
<EOS>
no
man
detest
and
despise
scurrility
more
than
myself
;
nor
hath
any
man
more
reason
;
for
none
hath
ever
be
treat
with
more
;
and
what
be
a
very
severe
fate
,
I
have
have
some
of
the
abusive
writing
of
those
very
man
father
upon
me
,
who
,
in
other
of
their
work
,
have
abuse
me
themselves
with
the
utmost
virulence
.
  
<EOS>
all
these
work
,
however
,
I
be
well
convinced
,
will
be
dead
long
before
this
page
shall
offer
itself
to
thy
perusal
;
for
however
short
the
period
may
be
of
my
own
performance
,
they
will
most
probably
outlive
their
own
infirm
author
,
and
the
weakly
production
of
his
abusive
contemporary
.
    
<EOS>
contain
a
very
tragical
incident
.
 
<EOS>
while
Jones
be
employ
in
those
unpleasant
meditation
,
with
which
we
leave
him
torment
himself
,
Partridge
come
stumble
into
the
room
with
his
face
paler
than
ashe
,
his
eye
fix
in
his
head
,
his
hair
stand
an
end
,
and
every
limb
tremble
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
he
look
as
he
would
have
do
<EOS>
have
he
see
a
spectre
,
or
have
he
,
indeed
,
be
a
spectre
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
,
who
be
little
subject
to
fear
,
could
not
avoid
be
somewhat
shocked
at
this
sudden
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
do
,
indeed
,
himself
change
colour
,
and
his
voice
a
little
faultered
while
he
ask
him
<EOS>
,
what
be
the
matter
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
sir
,
"
say
Partridge
,
"
you
will
not
be
angry
with
me
.
<EOS>
indeed
I
do
not
listen
,
but
I
be
oblige
to
stay
in
the
outward
room
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
wish
I
have
be
a
hundred
mile
off
,
rather
than
have
hear
what
I
have
hear
.
"
<EOS>
"
why
,
what
be
the
matter
?
"
say
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
the
matter
,
sir
?
<EOS>
o
good
Heaven
<EOS>
!
"
answer
Partridge
,
"
be
that
woman
who
be
just
go
out
the
woman
who
be
with
you
at
Upton
?
"
<EOS>
"
She
be
,
Partridge
,
"
cry
Jones
.
"
<EOS>
and
do
you
really
,
sir
,
go
to
bed
with
that
woman
?
"
<EOS>
say
he
,
tremble
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
what
past
between
us
be
no
secret
,
"
say
Jones
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
but
pray
,
sir
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
sir
,
answer
me
,
"
cry
Partridge
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
do
,
"
cry
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
why
then
,
the
Lord
have
mercy
upon
your
soul
,
and
forgive
you
,
"
cry
partridge
;
"
but
as
sure
as
I
stand
here
alive
,
you
have
be
a
-
bed
with
your
own
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
upon
these
word
Jones
become
in
a
moment
a
great
picture
of
horror
than
Partridge
himself
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
indeed
,
for
some
time
strike
dumb
with
amazement
,
and
both
stand
stare
wildly
at
each
other
.
<EOS>
at
last
his
word
find
way
,
and
in
an
interrupted
voice
he
say
,
"
how
!
how
!
<EOS>
what
be
this
<EOS>
you
tell
me
?
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
sir
,
"
cry
Partridge
,
"
I
have
not
breath
enough
leave
to
tell
you
now
,
but
what
I
have
say
be
most
certainly
true
.
 
<EOS>
that
woman
who
now
go
out
be
your
own
mother
.
<EOS>
how
unlucky
be
it
for
you
,
sir
,
that
I
do
not
happen
to
see
her
at
that
time
,
to
have
prevent
it
!
<EOS>
sure
the
devil
himself
must
have
contrive
to
bring
about
this
wickedness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
sure
,
"
cry
Jones
,
"
Fortune
will
never
have
do
with
me
till
she
hath
drive
me
to
distraction
.
<EOS>
but
why
do
I
blame
Fortune
?
<EOS>
I
be
myself
the
cause
of
all
my
misery
.
<EOS>
all
the
dreadful
mischief
which
have
befall
me
be
the
consequence
only
of
my
own
folly
and
vice
.
<EOS>
what
thou
hast
tell
me
,
Partridge
,
hath
almost
deprive
me
of
my
sense
!
<EOS>
and
be
Mrs
Waters
,
then
 
<EOS>
but
why
do
I
ask
?
<EOS>
for
thou
must
certainly
know
her
 
<EOS>
if
thou
hast
any
affection
for
me
,
nay
,
if
thou
hast
any
pity
,
let
me
beseech
thee
to
fetch
this
miserable
woman
back
again
to
me
.
<EOS>
o
good
Heavens
!
<EOS>
incest
 
with
a
mother
!
<EOS>
to
what
be
I
reserve
!
"
<EOS>
He
then
fall
into
the
most
violent
and
frantic
agony
of
grief
and
despair
,
in
which
Partridge
declare
he
would
not
leave
him
;
but
at
last
,
have
vent
the
first
torrent
of
passion
,
he
come
a
little
to
himself
;
and
then
,
have
acquaint
Partridge
that
he
would
find
this
wretched
woman
in
the
same
house
where
the
wound
gentleman
be
lodge
,
he
despatch
him
in
quest
of
her

<EOS>
if
the
reader
will
please
to
refresh
his
memory
,
by
turn
to
the
scene
at
Upton
,
in
the
ninth
book
,
he
will
be
apt
to
admire
the
many
strange
accident
which
unfortunately
prevent
any
interview
between
Partridge
and
Mrs
Waters
,
when
she
spend
a
whole
day
there
with
Mr
Jones
.
<EOS>
instance
of
this
kind
we
may
frequently
observe
in
life
,
where
the
great
event
be
produce
by
a
nice
train
of
little
circumstance
;
and
more
than
one
example
of
this
may
be
discover
by
the
accurate
eye
,
in
this
our
history
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
fruitless
search
of
two
or
three
hour
,
Partridge
return
back
to
his
master
,
without
have
see
Mrs
Waters
.
<EOS>
Jones
,
who
be
in
a
state
of
desperation
at
his
delay
,
be
almost
rave
mad
when
he
bring
him
his
account
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
long
,
however
,
in
this
condition
before
he
receive
the
following
letter
:
    
"
SIR
,
    
"
since
I
leave
you
I
have
see
a
gentleman
,
from
whom
I
have
learn
  
something
concern
you
which
greatly
surprize
and
affect
me
;
but
  
as
I
have
not
at
present
leisure
to
communicate
a
matter
of
such
  
high
importance
,
you
must
suspend
your
curiosity
till
our
next
  
meeting
,
which
shall
be
the
first
moment
I
be
able
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
o
,
Mr
  
Jones
,
little
do
I
think
,
when
I
past
that
happy
day
at
Upton
,
the
  
reflection
upon
which
be
like
to
embitter
all
my
future
life
,
who
it
  
be
to
whom
I
owe
such
perfect
happiness
.
<EOS>
believe
me
to
be
ever
  
sincerely
your
unfortunate
                                       
"
J.
WATERS
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
"
P.S.
<EOS>
I
would
have
you
comfort
yourself
as
much
as
possible
,
for
Mr
  
Fitzpatrick
be
in
no
manner
of
danger
;
so
that
whatever
other
  
grievous
crime
you
may
have
to
repent
of
,
the
guilt
of
blood
be
not
  
among
the
number
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
have
read
the
letter
,
let
it
drop
(
for
he
be
unable
to
hold
it
,
and
indeed
have
scarce
the
use
of
any
one
of
his
faculty
)
.
<EOS>
Partridge
take
it
up
,
and
have
receive
consent
by
silence
,
read
it
likewise
;
nor
have
it
upon
him
a
less
sensible
effect
.
<EOS>
the
pencil
,
and
not
the
pen
,
should
describe
the
horror
which
appear
in
both
their
countenance
.
<EOS>
while
they
both
remain
speechless
the
turnkey
enter
the
room
,
and
,
without
take
any
notice
of
what
sufficiently
discover
itself
in
the
face
of
them
both
,
acquaint
Jones
that
a
man
without
desire
to
speak
with
him
.
<EOS>
this
person
be
presently
introduce
,
and
be
no
other
than
Black
George
.
  
<EOS>
as
sight
of
horror
be
not
so
usual
to
George
as
they
be
to
the
turnkey
,
he
instantly
see
the
great
disorder
which
appear
in
the
face
of
Jones
.
<EOS>
this
he
impute
to
the
accident
that
have
happen
,
which
be
report
in
the
very
bad
light
in
Mr
Western
's
family
;
he
conclude
,
therefore
,
that
the
gentleman
be
dead
,
and
that
Mr
Jones
be
in
a
fair
way
of
come
to
a
shameful
end
.
<EOS>
a
thought
which
give
him
much
uneasiness
;
for
George
be
of
a
compassionate
disposition
,
and
notwithstanding
a
small
breach
of
friendship
which
he
have
be
over
-
tempt
to
commit
,
be
,
in
the
main
,
not
insensible
of
the
obligation
he
have
formerly
receive
from
Mr
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
fellow
,
therefore
,
scarce
refrain
from
a
tear
at
the
present
sight
.
<EOS>
He
tell
Jones
he
be
heartily
sorry
for
his
misfortune
,
and
beg
him
to
consider
if
he
could
be
of
any
manner
of
service
.
"
<EOS>
perhaps
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
may
want
a
little
matter
of
money
upon
this
occasion
;
if
you
do
,
sir
,
what
little
I
have
be
heartily
at
your
service
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
shake
him
very
heartily
by
the
hand
,
and
give
him
many
thank
for
the
kind
offer
he
have
make
;
but
answer
,
"
He
have
not
the
least
want
of
that
kind
.
"
<EOS>
upon
which
George
begin
to
press
his
service
more
eagerly
than
before
.
<EOS>
Jones
again
thank
him
,
with
assurance
that
he
want
nothing
which
be
in
the
power
of
any
man
live
to
give
.
<EOS>
"
come
,
come
,
my
good
master
,
"
answer
George
,
"
do
not
take
the
matter
so
much
to
heart
.
<EOS>
thing
may
end
better
than
you
imagine
;
to
be
sure
you
an't
<EOS>
the
first
gentleman
who
hath
kill
a
man
,
and
yet
come
off
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
be
wide
of
the
matter
,
George
,
"
say
Partridge
,
"
the
gentleman
be
not
dead
,
nor
like
to
die
.
<EOS>
do
not
disturb
my
master
,
at
present
,
for
he
be
troubled
about
a
matter
in
which
it
be
not
in
your
power
to
do
him
any
good
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
know
what
I
may
be
able
to
do
,
Mr
Partridge
,
"
answer
George
;
"
if
his
concern
be
about
my
young
lady
,
I
have
some
news
to
tell
my
master
.
"
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
say
,
Mr
George
?
"
cry
Jones
.
"
<EOS>
Hath
anything
lately
happen
in
which
my
Sophia
be
concern
?
<EOS>
My
Sophia
!
<EOS>
how
dare
such
a
wretch
as
I
mention
her
so
profanely
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
will
be
yours
yet
,
"
answer
George
.
<EOS>
"
why
yes
,
sir
,
I
have
something
to
tell
you
about
her
.
<EOS>
Madam
western
hath
just
bring
Madam
Sophia
home
,
and
there
hath
be
a
terrible
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
possibly
learn
the
very
right
of
it
;
but
my
master
he
hath
be
in
a
vast
big
passion
,
and
so
be
Madam
Western
,
and
I
hear
her
say
,
as
she
go
out
of
door
into
her
chair
,
that
she
would
never
set
her
foot
in
master
's
house
again
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
be
the
matter
,
not
I
,
but
everything
be
very
quiet
when
I
come
out
;
but
Robin
,
who
wait
at
supper
,
say
he
have
never
see
the
squire
for
a
long
while
in
such
good
humour
with
young
madam
;
that
he
kiss
her
several
time
,
and
swear
she
should
be
her
own
mistress
,
and
he
never
would
think
of
confine
her
any
more
.
<EOS>
I
think
this
news
would
please
you
,
and
so
I
slip
out
,
though
it
be
so
late
,
to
inform
you
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Jones
assure
George
that
it
do
greatly
please
him
;
for
though
he
should
never
more
presume
to
lift
his
eye
toward
that
incomparable
creature
,
nothing
could
so
much
relieve
his
misery
as
the
satisfaction
he
should
always
have
in
hearing
of
her
welfare
.
  
<EOS>
the
rest
of
the
conversation
which
pass
at
the
visit
be
not
important
enough
to
be
here
relate
.
<EOS>
the
reader
will
,
therefore
,
forgive
us
this
abrupt
break
off
,
and
be
pleased
to
hear
how
this
great
good
-
will
of
the
squire
towards
his
daughter
be
bring
about
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Western
,
on
her
first
arrival
at
her
brother
's
lodging
,
begin
to
set
forth
the
great
honour
and
advantage
which
would
accrue
to
the
family
by
the
match
with
Lord
Fellamar
,
which
her
niece
have
absolutely
refuse
;
in
which
refusal
,
<EOS>
when
the
squire
take
the
part
of
his
daughter
,
she
fall
immediately
into
the
most
violent
passion
,
and
so
irritated
and
provoke
the
squire
,
that
neither
his
patience
nor
his
prudence
could
bear
it
any
longer
;
upon
which
there
ensue
between
them
both
so
warm
a
bout
at
altercation
,
that
perhaps
the
region
of
Billingsgate
never
equal
it
.
<EOS>
in
the
heat
of
this
scold
Mrs
Western
depart
,
and
have
consequently
no
leisure
to
acquaint
her
brother
with
the
letter
which
Sophia
receive
,
which
may
have
possibly
produce
ill
effect
;
but
,
to
say
truth
,
I
believe
it
never
once
occur
to
her
memory
at
this
time
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mrs
Western
be
go
,
Sophia
,
who
have
be
hitherto
silent
,
as
well
indeed
from
necessity
as
inclination
,
begin
to
return
the
compliment
which
her
father
have
make
her
,
in
take
her
part
against
her
aunt
,
by
take
his
likewise
against
the
lady
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
first
time
of
her
so
do
,
and
it
be
in
the
high
degree
acceptable
to
the
squire
.
<EOS>
again
,
he
remember
that
Mr
Allworthy
have
insist
on
an
entire
relinquishment
of
all
violent
mean
;
and
,
indeed
,
as
he
make
no
doubt
but
that
Jones
would
be
hang
,
he
do
not
in
the
least
question
succeed
with
his
daughter
by
fair
mean
;
he
now
,
therefore
,
once
more
give
a
loose
to
his
natural
fondness
for
her
,
which
have
such
an
effect
on
the
dutiful
,
grateful
,
tender
,
and
affectionate
heart
of
Sophia
,
that
have
her
honour
,
give
to
Jones
,
and
something
else
,
perhaps
,
in
which
he
be
concern
,
be
remove
,
I
much
doubt
whether
she
would
not
have
sacrifice
herself
to
a
man
she
do
not
like
,
to
have
oblige
her
father
.
<EOS>
She
promise
him
she
would
make
it
the
whole
business
of
her
life
to
oblige
him
,
and
would
never
marry
any
man
against
his
consent
;
which
bring
the
old
man
so
near
to
his
high
happiness
,
that
he
be
resolve
to
take
the
other
step
,
and
go
to
bed
completely
drunk
.
    
<EOS>
Allworthy
visit
old
Nightingale
;
with
a
strange
discovery
that
he
make
on
that
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
the
morning
after
these
thing
have
happen
,
Mr
Allworthy
go
,
accord
to
his
promise
,
to
visit
old
Nightingale
,
with
whom
his
authority
be
so
great
,
that
,
after
have
sit
with
him
three
hour
,
he
at
last
prevail
with
him
to
consent
to
see
his
son
.
  
<EOS>
here
an
accident
happen
of
a
very
extraordinary
kind
;
one
indeed
of
those
strange
chance
whence
very
good
and
grave
man
have
conclude
that
Providence
often
interpose
in
the
discovery
of
the
most
secret
villany
,
in
order
to
caution
man
from
quit
the
path
of
honesty
,
however
warily
they
tread
in
those
of
vice
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
,
at
his
entrance
into
Mr
Nightingale
's
,
see
Black
George
;
he
take
no
notice
of
him
,
nor
do
Black
George
imagine
he
have
perceive
him
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
when
their
conversation
on
the
principal
point
be
over
,
Allworthy
ask
Nightingale
,
whether
he
know
one
George
Seagrim
,
and
upon
what
business
he
come
to
his
house
?
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
answer
Nightingale
,
"
I
know
him
very
well
,
and
a
most
extraordinary
fellow
he
be
,
who
,
in
these
day
,
hath
be
able
to
hoard
up
L500
from
rent
a
very
small
estate
of
L30
a
year
.
"
<EOS>
"
and
be
this
the
story
which
he
hath
tell
you
?
<EOS>
"
cry
Allworthy
.
"
<EOS>
nay
,
it
be
true
,
I
promise
you
,
"
say
Nightingale
,
"
for
I
have
the
money
now
in
my
own
hand
,
in
five
bank
-
bill
,
which
I
be
to
lay
out
either
in
a
mortgage
,
or
in
some
purchase
in
the
north
of
England
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
bank
-
bill
be
no
sooner
produce
at
Allworthy
's
desire
than
he
bless
himself
at
the
strangeness
of
the
discovery
.
<EOS>
He
presently
tell
Nightingale
that
these
bank
-
bill
be
formerly
his
,
and
then
acquaint
him
with
the
whole
affair
.
<EOS>
as
there
be
no
man
who
complain
more
of
the
fraud
of
business
than
highwayman
,
gamester
,
and
other
thief
of
that
kind
,
so
there
be
none
who
so
bitterly
exclaim
against
the
fraud
of
gamester
,
&
c.
,
as
usurer
,
broker
,
and
other
thief
of
this
kind
;
whether
it
be
that
the
one
way
of
cheating
be
a
discountenance
or
reflection
upon
the
other
,
or
that
money
,
which
be
the
common
mistress
of
all
cheat
,
make
them
regard
each
other
in
the
light
of
rival
;
but
Nightingale
no
sooner
hear
the
story
than
he
exclaim
against
the
fellow
in
term
much
severe
than
the
justice
and
honesty
of
Allworthy
have
bestow
on
him
.
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
desire
Nightingale
to
retain
both
the
money
and
the
secret
till
he
should
hear
farther
from
him
;
and
,
if
he
should
in
the
meantime
see
the
fellow
,
that
he
would
not
take
the
least
notice
to
him
of
the
discovery
which
he
have
make
.
<EOS>
He
then
return
to
his
lodging
,
where
he
find
Mrs
Miller
in
a
very
dejected
condition
,
on
account
of
the
information
she
have
receive
from
her
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
,
with
great
chearfulness
,
tell
her
that
he
have
much
good
news
to
communicate
;
and
,
with
little
further
preface
,
acquaint
her
that
he
have
bring
Mr
Nightingale
to
consent
to
see
his
son
,
and
do
not
in
the
least
doubt
to
effect
a
perfect
reconciliation
between
them
;
though
he
find
the
father
more
sowere
by
another
accident
of
the
same
kind
which
have
happen
in
his
family
.
<EOS>
He
then
mention
the
running
away
of
the
uncle
's
daughter
,
which
he
have
be
tell
by
the
old
gentleman
,
and
which
Mrs
Miller
and
her
son
-
in
-
law
do
not
yet
know
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
may
suppose
Mrs
Miller
receive
this
account
with
great
thankfulness
,
and
no
less
pleasure
;
but
so
uncommon
be
her
friendship
to
Jones
,
that
I
be
not
certain
whether
the
uneasiness
she
suffer
for
his
sake
do
not
overbalance
her
satisfaction
at
hear
a
piece
of
news
tend
so
much
to
the
happiness
of
her
own
family
;
nor
whether
even
this
very
news
,
as
it
remind
her
of
the
obligation
she
have
to
Jones
,
do
not
hurt
as
well
as
please
her
;
when
her
grateful
heart
say
to
her
,
"
while
my
own
family
be
happy
,
how
miserable
be
the
poor
creature
to
whose
generosity
we
owe
the
beginning
of
all
this
happiness
!
"
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
,
have
leave
her
a
little
while
to
chew
the
cud
(
if
I
may
use
that
expression
)
on
these
first
tiding
,
tell
her
he
have
still
something
more
to
impart
,
which
he
believe
would
give
her
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
have
discover
a
pretty
considerable
treasure
belong
to
the
young
gentleman
,
your
friend
;
but
perhaps
,
indeed
,
his
present
situation
may
be
such
that
it
will
be
of
no
service
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
the
latter
part
of
the
speech
give
Mrs
Miller
to
understand
who
be
mean
,
and
she
answer
with
a
sigh
,
"
I
hope
not
,
sir

"
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
too

cry
Allworthy

"
with
all
my
heart
;
but
my
nephew
tell
me
this
morning
he
have
hear
a
very
bad
account
of
the
affair
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Good
Heaven
!
<EOS>
sir
,
"
say
she
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
must
not
speak
,
and
yet
it
be
certainly
very
hard
to
be
oblige
to
hold
one
's
tongue
when
one
hear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
say
Allworthy
,
"
you
may
say
whatever
you
please
,
you
know
me
too
well
to
think
I
have
a
prejudice
against
any
one
;
and
as
for
that
young
man
,
I
assure
you
I
should
be
heartily
pleased
to
find
he
could
acquit
himself
of
everything
,
and
particularly
of
this
sad
affair
.
<EOS>
You
can
testify
the
affection
I
have
formerly
bear
him
.
<EOS>
the
world
,
I
know
,
censure
me
for
love
him
so
much
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
withdraw
that
affection
from
him
without
think
I
have
the
just
cause
.
<EOS>
believe
me
,
Mrs
Miller
,
I
should
be
glad
to
find
I
have
be
mistake
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Miller
be
go
eagerly
to
reply
,
when
a
servant
acquaint
her
that
a
gentleman
without
desire
to
speak
with
her
immediately
.
<EOS>
Allworthy
then
enquire
for
his
nephew
,
and
be
tell
that
he
have
be
for
some
time
in
his
room
with
the
gentleman
who
use
to
come
to
him
,
and
whom
Mr
Allworthy
guess
rightly
to
be
Mr
Dowling
,
he
desire
presently
to
speak
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
when
dowle
attend
,
Allworthy
put
the
case
of
the
bank
-
note
to
him
,
without
mention
any
name
,
and
ask
in
what
manner
such
a
person
may
be
punish
.
<EOS>
to
which
Dowling
answer
,
"
He
think
he
may
be
indict
on
the
Black
Act
;
but
say
,
as
it
be
a
matter
of
some
nicety
,
it
would
be
proper
to
go
to
counsel
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
be
to
attend
counsel
presently
upon
an
affair
of
Mr
Western
's
,
and
if
Mr
Allworthy
please
he
would
lay
the
case
before
them
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
agree
to
;
and
then
Mrs
Miller
,
open
the
door
,
cry
,
"
I
ask
pardon
,
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
you
have
company
;
"
but
Allworthy
desire
her
to
come
in
,
say
he
have
finish
his
business
.
<EOS>
upon
which
Mr
Dowling
withdraw
,
and
Mrs
Miller
introduce
Mr
Nightingale
the
young
,
to
return
thank
for
the
great
kindness
do
him
by
Allworthy
:
but
she
have
scarce
patience
to
let
the
young
gentleman
finish
his
speech
before
she
interrupt
him
,
say
,
"
o
sir
!
<EOS>
Mr
Nightingale
bring
great
news
about
poor
Mr
Jones
:
he
hath
be
to
see
the
wound
gentleman
,
who
be
out
of
all
danger
of
death
,
and
,
what
be
more
,
declare
he
fall
upon
poor
Mr
Jones
himself
,
and
beat
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
sir
,
you
would
not
have
Mr
Jones
be
a
coward
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
a
man
myself
,
I
be
sure
,
if
any
man
be
to
strike
me
,
I
should
draw
my
sword
.
<EOS>
do
pray
,
my
dear
,
tell
Mr
Allworthy
,
tell
him
all
yourself
.
"
<EOS>
Nightingale
then
confirm
what
Mrs
Miller
have
say
;
and
conclude
with
many
handsome
thing
of
Jones
,
who
be
,
he
say
,
one
of
the
best
-
natured
fellow
in
the
world
,
and
not
in
the
least
inclined
to
be
quarrelsome
.
<EOS>
here
Nightingale
be
go
to
cease
,
when
Mrs
Miller
again
beg
him
to
relate
all
the
many
dutiful
expression
he
have
hear
him
make
use
of
towards
Mr
Allworthy
.
<EOS>
"
to
say
the
utmost
good
of
Mr
Allworthy
,
"
cry
Nightingale
,
"
be
do
no
more
than
strict
justice
,
and
can
have
no
merit
in
it
:
but
indeed
,
I
must
say
,
no
man
can
be
more
sensible
of
the
obligation
he
hath
to
so
good
a
man
than
be
poor
Jones
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
sir
,
I
be
convince
the
weight
of
your
displeasure
be
the
heavy
burthen
he
lie
under
.
<EOS>
He
hath
often
lament
it
to
me
,
and
hath
as
often
protest
in
the
most
solemn
manner
he
hath
never
be
intentionally
guilty
of
any
offence
towards
you
;
<EOS>
nay
,
he
hath
swear
he
would
rather
die
a
thousand
death
than
he
would
have
his
conscience
upbraid
him
with
one
disrespectful
,
ungrateful
,
or
undutiful
thought
towards
you
.
<EOS>
but
I
ask
pardon
,
sir
,
I
be
afraid
I
presume
to
intermeddle
too
far
in
so
tender
a
point
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
have
speak
no
more
than
what
a
Christian
ought
,
"
cry
Mrs
Miller
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
Mr
Nightingale
,
"
answer
Allworthy
,
"
I
applaud
your
generous
friendship
,
and
I
wish
he
may
merit
it
of
you
.
<EOS>
I
confess
I
be
glad
to
hear
the
report
you
bring
from
this
unfortunate
gentleman
;
and
,
if
that
matter
should
turn
out
to
be
as
you
represent
it
(
and
,
indeed
,
I
doubt
nothing
of
what
you
say
)
,
<EOS>
I
may
,
perhaps
,
in
time
,
be
bring
to
think
better
than
lately
I
have
of
this
young
man
;
for
this
good
gentlewoman
here
,
nay
,
all
who
know
me
,
can
witness
that
I
love
him
as
dearly
as
if
he
have
be
my
own
son
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
have
consider
him
as
a
child
send
by
fortune
to
my
care
.
<EOS>
I
still
remember
the
innocent
,
the
helpless
situation
in
which
I
find
him
.
<EOS>
I
feel
the
tender
pressure
of
his
little
hand
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
He
be
my
darling
,
indeed
he
be
.
"
<EOS>
at
which
word
he
cease
,
and
the
tear
stand
in
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
answer
which
Mrs
Miller
make
may
lead
us
into
fresh
matter
,
we
will
here
stop
to
account
for
the
visible
alteration
in
Mr
Allworthy
's
mind
,
and
the
abatement
of
his
anger
to
Jones
.
<EOS>
revolution
of
this
kind
,
it
be
true
,
do
frequently
occur
in
history
and
dramatic
writer
,
for
no
other
reason
than
because
the
history
or
play
draw
to
a
conclusion
,
and
be
justify
by
authority
of
author
;
yet
,
though
we
insist
upon
as
much
authority
as
any
author
whatever
,
we
shall
use
this
power
very
sparingly
,
and
<EOS>
never
but
when
we
be
drive
to
it
by
necessity
,
which
we
do
not
at
present
foresee
will
happen
in
this
work
.
  
<EOS>
this
alteration
then
in
the
mind
of
Mr
Allworthy
be
occasion
by
a
letter
he
have
just
receive
from
Mr
Square
,
and
which
we
shall
give
the
reader
in
the
beginning
of
the
next
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
contain
two
letter
in
very
different
stile
.
   
<EOS>
"
my
WORTHY
FRIEND
,
 
<EOS>
I
inform
you
in
my
last
that
I
be
forbid
  
<EOS>
the
use
of
the
water
,
as
they
be
find
by
experience
rather
to
  
increase
than
lessen
the
symptom
of
my
distemper
.
<EOS>
I
must
now
  
acquaint
you
with
a
piece
of
news
,
which
,
I
believe
,
will
afflict
my
  
friend
more
than
it
hath
afflict
me
.
<EOS>
Dr
Harrington
and
Dr
  
Brewster
have
inform
me
that
there
be
no
hope
of
my
recovery
.
    
<EOS>
"
I
have
somewhere
read
,
that
the
great
use
of
philosophy
be
to
learn
  
to
die
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
therefore
so
far
disgrace
mine
as
to
shew
any
  
surprize
at
receive
a
lesson
which
I
must
be
think
to
have
so
  
long
study
.
<EOS>
yet
,
to
say
the
truth
,
one
page
of
the
Gospel
teach
  
this
lesson
better
than
all
the
volume
of
antient
or
modern
  
philosopher
.
<EOS>
the
assurance
it
give
us
of
another
life
be
a
much
  
strong
support
to
a
good
mind
than
all
the
consolation
that
be
  
draw
from
the
necessity
of
nature
,
the
emptiness
or
satiety
of
our
  
enjoyment
here
,
or
any
other
topic
of
those
declamation
which
be
  
sometimes
capable
of
arm
our
mind
with
a
stubborn
patience
in
  
bear
the
thought
of
death
,
but
never
of
raise
them
to
a
real
  
contempt
of
it
,
and
much
less
of
make
us
think
it
be
a
real
good
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
not
here
be
understand
to
throw
the
horrid
censure
of
  
atheism
,
or
even
the
absolute
denial
of
immortality
,
on
all
who
be
  
call
philosopher
.
<EOS>
many
of
that
sect
,
as
well
antient
as
modern
,
  
have
,
from
the
light
of
reason
,
discover
some
hope
of
a
future
  
state
;
but
in
reality
,
that
light
be
so
faint
and
glimmer
,
and
  
the
hope
be
so
incertain
and
precarious
,
that
it
may
be
justly
  
doubt
on
which
side
their
belief
turn
.
<EOS>
Plato
himself
conclude
  
his
Phaedon
with
declare
that
his
good
argument
amount
only
to
  
raise
a
probability
;
and
Cicero
himself
seem
rather
to
profess
an
  
inclination
to
believe
,
than
any
actual
belief
in
the
doctrine
of
  
immortality
.
<EOS>
as
to
myself
,
to
be
very
sincere
with
you
,
I
never
be
  
much
in
earnest
in
this
faith
till
I
be
in
earnest
<EOS>
a
Christian
.
    
<EOS>
"
You
will
perhaps
wonder
at
the
latter
expression
;
but
I
assure
you
  
it
hath
not
be
till
very
lately
that
I
could
,
with
truth
,
call
  
myself
so
.
<EOS>
the
pride
of
philosophy
have
intoxicate
my
reason
,
and
  
the
sublime
of
all
wisdom
appear
to
me
,
as
it
do
to
the
Greeks
  
of
old
,
to
be
foolishness
.
<EOS>
God
hath
,
however
,
be
so
gracious
to
  
shew
me
<EOS>
my
error
in
time
,
and
<EOS>
to
bring
me
into
the
way
of
truth
,
  
before
I
sink
into
utter
darkness
forever
.
    
<EOS>

I
find
myself
begin
to
grow
weak
,
I
shall
therefore
hasten
to
  
the
main
purpose
of
this
letter

<EOS>
"
when
I
reflect
on
the
action
of
my
past
life
,
I
know
of
nothing
  
which
sit
heavy
upon
my
conscience
than
the
injustice
I
have
be
  
guilty
of
to
that
poor
wretch
your
adopt
son

<EOS>
I
have
,
indeed
,
not
  
only
connive
at
the
villany
of
other

be
myself
active
in
  
injustice
towards
him

me

my

friend
,
when
I
tell
you
,
  
on
the
word
of
a
die
man

he
hath
be
basely
injure

<EOS>
as
to
the
  
principal
fact
,
upon
the
misrepresentation
of
which
you
discard
  
him
,
I
solemnly
assure
you
he
be
innocent

<EOS>
when
you
lay
upon
your
  
suppose
deathbed

the
only
person
in
the
house
who
testify
  
any
real
concern

and
what
happen
afterwards
arise
from
the
  
wildness
of
his
joy
on
your
recovery

and
,
I
be
sorry
to
say
it
,
  
from
the
baseness
of
another
person
<EOS>
(
but
it
be
my
desire
to
justify
  
the
innocent

to
accuse
none

believe
me
,
my
friend

this
young
  
man

the
noblest
generosity
of
heart

the
most
perfect
capacity

high
integrity

gratitude

contrary

I
be
satisfied

when

him
from
your

the
wicked
and

reason

concealing
  
this
from
you
so
long

reveal
it
now

can

at
the
revolution

visibly
appear
in
Mr
Allworthy

Thwackum

another
letter

different

SIR
,
    
"
I
be
not
at
all
surprize
at
hearing
from
your
worthy
nephew
a
  
fresh
instance
of
the
villany
of
Mr
Square
the
atheist
's
young
  
pupil

<EOS>
I
shall
not
wonder
at
any
murder
he
may
commit
;
and
I
  
heartily
pray
that
your
own
blood
may
not
seal
up
his
final
  
commitment
to
the
place
of
wail
and
gnashing
of
tooth

though
you
can
not
want
sufficient
call
to
repentance
for
the
many
  
unwarrantable
weakness
exemplify
in
your
behaviour
to
this
  
wretch
,
so
much
to
the
prejudice
of
your
own
lawful
family

and
of
  
your
character

I
say
,
though
these
may
sufficiently
be
suppose

prick

goad
your

you

I

pray
you
  
seriously
to
consider
the
judgment
which
be
likely
to
overtake
this
  
wicked
villain

let
it
serve
at

as
a
warning

you

you

indefatigable

reflection

<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
you
have
give
away
the
living

Westerton
so
hastily

<EOS>
I
should
have
apply
on
that
occasion
earlier
,
<EOS>
have
I
think
you
  
would
not
have
acquaint
me
previous
to

<EOS>
Your
  
objection
to
plurality
be
be
righteous
over

much

<EOS>
if
there
be
  
any
crime
in

so
many
godly

would
not

it

if
the

(
as
we

he

in

I
hope
you
will
think
of
me

since
I
be
certain
you
  
must
be
convince
of
my
most
sincere
attachment

high

a
welfare

all
worldly

trifling

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
first
time
Thwackum
ever
write
in
this
authoritative
stile
to
Allworthy
,
and
of
this
he
have
afterwards
sufficient
reason
to
repent
,
as
in
the
case
of
those
who
mistake
the
high
degree
of
goodness
for
the
low
degree
of
weakness
.
<EOS>
Allworthy
have
indeed
never
like
this
man
.
<EOS>
He
know
him
to
be
proud
and
ill
-
natured
;
he
also
know
that
his
divinity
itself
be
tincture
with
his
temper
,
and
such
as
in
many
respect
he
himself
do
by
no
means
approve
;
but
he
be
at
the
same
time
an
excellent
scholar
,
and
most
indefatigable
in
teach
the
two
lad
.
<EOS>
add
to
this
,
the
strict
severity
of
his
life
and
manner
,
an
unimpeached
honesty
,
and
a
most
devout
attachment
to
religion
.
<EOS>
so
that
,
upon
the
whole
,
though
Allworthy
do
not
esteem
nor
love
the
man
,
yet
he
could
never
bring
himself
to
part
with
a
tutor
to
the
boy
,
who
be
,
both
by
learning
and
industry
,
extremely
well
qualified
for
his
office
;
and
he
hope
,
that
as
they
be
breed
up
in
his
own
house
,
and
under
his
own
eye
,
he
should
be
able
to
correct
whatever
be
wrong
in
Thwackum
's
instruction

<EOS>
in
which
the
history

<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
,
in
his
last
speech
,
have
recollect
some
tender
idea
concern
Jones
,
which
have
bring
tear
into
the
good
man
's
eye

<EOS>
this
Mrs

all
your

there
be
not
a

of

what
those

<EOS>
Mr

hath
now
discover
the

<EOS>
It
seem
these

by
a

be
a
rival
of

Mr

to
have
press
him
on

a

<EOS>
I
assure
them
I
do
not

<EOS>
Mr

here
hath
see
the
officer
himself

who
be
a

pretty

hath

answer
she

<EOS>

I

alehouse
in
Aldersgate

in
company
with
two
of
the
fellow
who
be
employ
by
Lord

and
who
be
by
that

<EOS>
"
I
own

"
say
Mrs

,
"
when
I
see
this
gentleman
come
into
the
room
to
you

I
tell
Mr

that
I
apprehend

"
<EOS>
Allworthy
shew
mark
of
astonishment
in
his
countenance
at
this
news

and
be
indeed
for
two
or
three
minute
strike
dumb
by
it

<EOS>
at
last
,
address
himself
to
Mr
Nightingale

he
say
,
"
I
must
confess
myself
,
sir
,
more
surprized
at
what

I
have
ever

anything
in
my
whole
life

be

<EOS>
"
I
be
most
certain

answer
Nightingale

"
<EOS>
at
Aldersgate
?
"
cry
Allworthy

"
<EOS>
and
be

the
two
fellow

<EOS>
"
I
be

the

very
near
half
an

"
<EOS>
"
well

in

manner

<EOS>
"
no

Nightingale
,
"
they
have
be
together
before
I
come

<EOS>
in
my
presence
the
lawyer
say
little
;
but
,
after
I
have
several
time
examine
the
fellow
,
who
persist
in
a
story
directly
contrary
to
what
I
have
hear
from
Mr
Jones
,
and
which
I
find
by
Mr
Fitzpatrick
<EOS>
be
a
rank
falshood
,
the
lawyer
then
desire
the
fellow
to
say
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
be
the
truth
,
and
seem
to
speak
so
much
in
favour
of
Mr
Jones
,
<EOS>
that
,
when
I
see
the

person
with

I
conclude
your
goodness
have
prompt
you
to
send
him
thith

<EOS>
"
and
do
you
not
send

thith

say
Mrs
Miller
.
 
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
do
not

"
answer
Allworthy
;
"
nor
<EOS>
do
I
know
he
have
go
on
such
an
errand

this
moment

<EOS>
"
I

it
all

upon

close

<EOS>
Son

let
me
beg
you
run
for
these
fellow

immediately
 
find
them
out

I
will
go
myself
"
 
<EOS>
"
dear
madam

"
say
Allworthy

"
be
patient
,

do
me
the
favour
to
send
a
servant
upstairs
to
call
Mr

hither

be
in

house

or
,
if
not

"
<EOS>
Mrs
Miller
go
out
mutter
something
to
herself
,
and
presently
return
with
an
answer
,
"
that
Mr
Dowling
be
go
;
but
that
the
t'other
,

as
she
call
him
,

be
come

<EOS>
Allworthy
be
of
a
cool
disposition
than
the
good
woman
,
whose
spirit
be
all
up
in
arm
in
the
cause
of
her
friend
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
however
without
some
suspicion
which
be
near
akin
to
hers
.
<EOS>
when
Blifil
come
into
the
room
,
he
ask
him
with
a
very
serious
countenance
,
and
with
a
less
friendly
look
than
he
have
ever
before
give
him
,
"
whether
he
know
anything
of
Mr
Dowling
's
have
see
any
of
the
person
who
be
present
at
the
duel
between
Jones
and
another
gentleman
?
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
so
dangerous
as
a
question
which
come
by
surprize
on
a
man
whose
business
it
be
to
conceal
truth
,
or
to
defend
falshood
.
<EOS>
for
which
reason
those
worthy
personage
,
whose
noble
office
it
be
to
save
the
life
of
their
fellow
-
creature
at
the
Old
Bailey
,
take
the
utmost
care
,
by
frequent
previous
examination
,
to
divine
every
question
which
may
be
ask
their
client
on
the
day
of
tryal
,
that
they
may
be
supply
with
proper
and
ready
answer
,
which
the
most
fertile
invention
can
not
supply
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
besides
,
the
sudden
and
violent
impulse
on
the
blood
,
occasion
by
these
surprize
,
cause
frequently
such
an
alteration
in
the
countenance
,
that
the
man
be
oblige
to
give
evidence
against
himself
.
<EOS>
and
such
indeed
be
the
alteration
which
the
countenance
of
Blifil
undergo
from
this
sudden
question
,
that
we
can
scarce
blame
the
eagerness
of
Mrs
Miller
,
who
immediately
cry
out
,
"
guilty
,
upon
my
honour
!
<EOS>
guilty
,
upon
my
soul
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
sharply
rebuke
her
for
this
impetuosity
;
and
then
turn
to
Blifil
,
who
seem
sink
into
the
earth
,
he
say
,
"
why
do
you
hesitate
,
sir
,
at
give
me
an
answer
?
<EOS>
You
certainly
must
have
employ
him
;
for
he
would
not
,
of
his
own
accord
,
I
believe
,
have
undertake
such
an
errand
,
and
especially
without
acquaint
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Blifil
then
answer
,
"
I
own
,
sir
,
I
have
be
guilty
of
an
offence
,
yet
may
I
hope
your
pardon
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
pardon
,
"
say
Allworthy
,
very
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
sir
,
"
answer
Blifil
,
"
I
know
you
would
be
offend
;
yet
surely
my
dear
uncle
will
forgive
the
effect
of
the
most
amiable
of
human
weakness
.
<EOS>
compassion
for
those
who
do
not
deserve
it
<EOS>
,
I
own
be
a
crime
;
and
yet
it
be
a
crime
from
which
you
yourself
be
not
entirely
free
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
have
be
guilty
of
it
in
more
than
one
instance
to
this
very
person
;
and
I
will
own
I
do
send
Mr
Dowling
,
not
on
a
vain
and
fruitless
enquiry
,
but
to
discover
the
witness
,
and
to
endeavour
to
soften
their
evidence
.
<EOS>
this
,
sir
,
be
the
truth
;
which
,
though
I
intend
to
conceal
from
you
,
I
will
not
deny
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
confess
,
"
say
Nightingale
,
"
this
be
the
light
in
which
it
appear
to
me
from
the
gentleman
's
behaviour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
madam
<EOS>
,
"
say
Allworthy
,
"
I
believe
you
will
once
in
your
life
own
you
have
entertain
a
wrong
suspicion
,
and
be
not
so
angry
with
my
nephew
as
you
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Miller
be
silent
;
for
,
though
she
could
not
so
hastily
be
pleased
with
Blifil
,
whom
she
look
upon
to
have
be
the
ruin
of
Jones
,
yet
in
this
particular
instance
he
have
impose
upon
her
as
well
as
upon
the
rest
;
so
entirely
have
the
devil
stand
his
friend
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
I
look
upon
the
vulgar
observation
,
"
that
the
devil
often
desert
his
friend
,
and
leave
them
in
the
lurch
,
"
to
be
a
great
abuse
on
that
gentleman
's
character
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
may
sometimes
desert
those
who
be
only
his
cup
acquaintance
;
or
who
,
at
most
,
be
but
half
his
;
but
he
generally
stand
by
those
who
be
thoroughly
his
servant
,
and
help
them
off
in
all
extremity
,
till
their
bargain
expire
.
  
<EOS>
as
a
conquered
rebellion
strengthen
a
government
,
or
as
health
be
more
perfectly
establish
by
recovery
from
some
disease
;
so
anger
,
when
remove
,
often
give
new
life
to
affection
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
case
of
Mr
Allworthy
;
for
Blifil
have
wipe
off
the
great
suspicion
,
the
less
,
which
have
be
raise
by
Square
's
letter
,
sink
of
course
,
and
be
forget
;
and
Thwackum
,
with
whom
he
be
greatly
offend
,
bear
alone
all
the
reflection
which
Square
have
cast
on
the
enemy
of
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
that
young
man
,
the
resentment
of
Mr
Allworthy
begin
more
and
more
to
abate
towards
him
.
<EOS>
He
tell
Blifil
,
"
He
do
not
only
forgive
the
extraordinary
effort
of
his
good
-
nature
,
but
would
give
him
the
pleasure
of
follow
his
example
.
"
<EOS>
then
,
turn
to
Mrs
Miller
with
a
smile
which
would
have
become
an
angel
,
he
cry
,
"
what
say
you
,
madam
?
<EOS>
shall
we
take
a
hackney
-
coach
,
and
all
of
us
together
pay
a
visit
to
your
friend
?
<EOS>
I
promise
you
it
be
not
the
first
visit
I
have
make
in
a
prison
.
"
  
<EOS>
every
reader
,
I
believe
,
will
be
able
to
answer
for
the
worthy
woman
;
but
they
must
have
a
great
deal
of
good
-
nature
,
and
be
well
acquaint
with
friendship
,
who
can
feel
what
she
feel
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
few
,
I
hope
,
be
capable
of
feel
what
now
pass
in
the
mind
of
Blifil
;
but
those
who
be
will
acknowledge
that
it
be
impossible
for
him
to
raise
any
objection
to
this
visit
.
<EOS>
Fortune
,
however
,
or
the
gentleman
lately
mention
above
,
stand
his
friend
,
and
prevent
his
undergoing
so
great
a
shock
;
for
at
the
very
instant
when
the
coach
be
send
for
,
Partridge
arrive
,
and
,
have
call
Mrs
Miller
from
the
company
,
acquaint
her
with
the
dreadful
accident
lately
come
to
light
;
and
hear
Mr
Allworthy
's
intention
,
beg
her
to
find
some
mean
of
stop
him
:
"
<EOS>
for
,
"
say
he
,
"
the
matter
must
at
all
hazard
be
keep
a
secret
from
him

and
if
he
should
now
go
,
he
will
find
Mr
Jones
and
his
mother
,
who
arrive
just
as
I
leave
him

lament
over
one
another
the
horrid
crime
they
have
ignorantly
commit

the

who
be
almost
deprive
of
her
sense

dreadful

be
never

capable
of
invention

at

however

as
woman
be
much
ready
at
this

she
bethink
herself
of
an
excuse

I
be
sure
,
sir

you
will
be
surprize
at
hear
any
objection
from
me
to
the
kind
proposal
you
just
now
make
;
and
yet
I
be
afraid
of
the
consequence
of
it
,
if
carry
immediately
into
execution
.
<EOS>
You
must
imagine
,
sir
,
that
all
the
calamity
which
have
lately
befall
this
poor
young
fellow
must
have
throw
him
into
the
low
dejection
of
spirit
;
and
now
,
sir

should
we
all
on
a
sudden
fling
him
into
such
a
violent
fit
of
joy
,
as
I
know
your
presence
will
occasion
,
it
may
,
I
be
afraid
,
produce
some
fatal
mischief
,
especially
as
his
servant
,
who
be
without
,
tell
me
he
be
very
far
from
be
well

<EOS>
"
be
his

without

"
<EOS>
cry
Allworthy
;
"
pray
call
him
hither
.
<EOS>
I
will
ask
him
some
question
concern
his
master

"
  
<EOS>
Partridge
be
at
first
afraid
to
appear
before
Mr
Allworthy
;
but
be
at
length
persuade
,
after
Mrs
Miller
,
who
have
often
hear
his
whole
story
from
his
own
mouth
,
have
promise
to
introduce
him
.
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
recollect
Partridge
the
moment
he
come
into
the
room
,
though
many
year
have
pass
since
he
have
see
him
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Miller
,
therefore
,
may
have
spare
here
a
formal
oration
,
in
which
,
indeed
,
she
be
something
prolix
;
for
the
reader
,
I
believe
,
may
have
observe
already
that
the
good
woman
,
among
other
thing
,
have
a
tongue
always
ready
for
the
service
of
her
friend

<EOS>
"
and
be
you

"
say
Allworthy
to
Partridge
,
"
the
servant
of
Mr
Jones
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
,
sir
,
"
answer
he
,
"
that
I
be
regularly
a
servant
,
but
I
live
with
him
,
an't
please
your
honour
,
at

.
<EOS>
non
sum
qualis
eram
,
as
your
honour
very
well
know

"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Allworthy
then
ask
him
many
question
concern
Jones
,
as
to
his
health
,
and
other
matter
;
to
all
which
Partridge
answer
,
without
have
the
least
regard
to
what
be
,
but
consider
only
what
he
would
have
thing
appear
;
for
a
strict
adherence
to
truth
be
not
among
the
article
of
this
honest
fellow
's
morality
or
his
religion
.
  
<EOS>
during
this
dialogue
Mr
Nightingale
take
his
leave
,
and
presently
after
Mrs
Miller
leave
the
room
,
when
Allworthy
likewise
despatch
Blifil
;
for
he
imagine
that
Partridge
when
alone
with
him
would
be
more
explicit
than
before
company
.
<EOS>
They
be
no
sooner
leave
in
private
together
than
Allworthy
begin
,
as
in
the
following
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
in
which
the
history
be
farther
continued
 
"

the
good

"
you
be
the
strange

being

<EOS>
not
only
to
have
suffer
as
you
have
formerly
for
obstinately
persist
in
a
falshood
,
but
to
persist
in
it
thus
to
the
last
,
and
to
pass
thus
upon
the
world
for
a
servant
of
your
own
son
!
<EOS>
what
interest
can
you
have
in
all
this
?
<EOS>
what
can
be
your
motive
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
,
sir

"
say
Partridge

fall
down
upon
his
knee
,
"
that
your
honour
be
prepossess
against
me
,
and
resolve
not
to
believe
anything
I
say
,
and
,
therefore
,
what
signify
my
protestation
?
<EOS>
but
yet
there
be
one
above
who
know
that
I
be
not
the
father
of
this
young
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
!
"
say
Allworthy
,
"
will
you
yet
deny
what
you
be
formerly
convict
of
upon
such
unanswerable
,
such
manif
evidence
?
<EOS>
Nay
,
what
a
confirmation
be
your
being
now
find
with
this
very
man
,
of
all
which
twenty
year
ago
appear
against
you
!
<EOS>
I
think
you
have
leave
the
country
!
<EOS>
nay
,
I
think
you
have
be
long
since
dead
.
 
<EOS>
in
what
manner
do
you
know
anything
of
this
young
man
?
<EOS>
where
do
you
meet
with
him
,
unless
you
have
keep
some
correspondence
together
?
<EOS>
do
not
deny
this
;
for
I
promise
you
it
will
greatly
raise
your
son
in
my
opinion
,
to
find
that
he
hath
such
a
sense
of
filial
duty
as
privately
to
support
his
father
for
so
many
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
if
your
honour
will
have
patience
to
hear
me
,
"
say
Partridge
,
"
I
will
tell
you
all
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
be
bid
go
on
,
he
proceed
thus
:
"
when
your
honour
conceive
that
displeasure
against
me
,
it
end
in
my
ruin
soon
after
;
<EOS>
for
I
lose
my
little
school
;
and
the
minister
,
think
I
suppose
it
would
be
agreeable
to
your
honour
,
turn
me
out
from
the
office
of
clerk
;
so
that
I
have
nothing
to
trust
to
<EOS>
but
the
barber
's
shop
,
which
,
in
a
country
place
like
that
,
be
a
poor
livelihood
;
and
when
my
wife
die
(
for
till
that
time
I
receive
a
pension
of
L12
a
year
from
an
unknown
hand
,
which
indeed
I
believe
be
your
honour
's
own
,
for
nobody
that
ever
I
hear
of
doth
these
thing
besides
)
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
be
say
,
when
she
die
,
this
pension
forsook
me
;
so
that
now
,
as
I
owe
two
or
three
small
debt
,
which
begin
to
be
troublesome
to
me
,
particularly
one
[

which
an
attorney
bring
up
by
law
-
charge
from
15

<EOS>
to
near
L30
,
and
as
I
find
all
my
usual
mean
of
living
have
forsook
me
,
I
pack
up
my
little
all
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
go
off
.
    
<EOS>
[

<EOS>
this
be
a
fact
which
I
know
happen
to
a
poor
clergyman
in
  
dorsetshire
,
by
the
villany
of
an
attorney
who
,
not
content
with
  
the
exorbitant
cost
to
which
the
poor
man
be
put
by
a
single
  
action
,
bring
afterwards
another
action
on
the
judgment
,
as
it
be
  
call
.
<EOS>
a
method
frequently
use
to
oppress
the
poor
,
and
bring
  
money
into
the
pocket
of
attorney
,
to
the
great
scandal
of
the
  
law

of
the
nation
,
of
Christianity
,

even
of
human
nature
  
itself
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
first
place
I
come
to
be
Salisbury
,
where
I
get
into
the
service
of
a
gentleman
belong
to
the
law

and
one
of
the
good
gentleman
that
ever
I
know
,
<EOS>
for
he
be
not
only
good
to
me

I
know
a
thousand
good
and
charitable
act
which
he
do
while
I
staid
with
him
;
and
I
have
know
him
often
refuse
business
because
it
be
paultry
and
oppressive
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
be
so
particular
,
"
say
Allworthy
;
"
I
know
this
gentleman
,

a
very
worthy
man
he
be
,
and
an
honour
to
his
profession

"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
"
continue
Partridge
,
"
from
hence
I
remove
to
Lymington
,
where
I
be
above
three
year
in
the
service
of
another
lawyer
,
who
be
likewise
a
very
good
sort
of
a
man
,
and
to
be
sure
one
of
the
merry
gentleman
in
England
.
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
at
the
end
of
the
three
year
I
set
up
a
little
school
,
and
be
likely
to
do
well
again
,
have
it
not
be
for
a
most
unlucky
accident
.
<EOS>
here
I
keep
a
pig
;
and
one
day
,
as
ill
fortune
would
have
it
,
this
pig
break
out
,
and
do
a
trespass
,
I
think
they
call
it
,
in
a
garden
belong
to
one
of
my
neighbour
,
who
be
a
proud
,
revengeful
man

and
employ
a
lawyer

one

I
can
not
think
of

but
he
send
for
a
writ
against
me

and
have
me
to
size

<EOS>
when
I
come
there
,
Lord
have
mercy
upon
me
 
to
hear
what
the
counsellor
say
!
<EOS>
there
be
one
that
tell
my

the
confounded
lie
about
me

he
say
that
I
use
to
drive
my
hog
into
other
folk

garden
,
and
a
great
deal
more
;
and
at
last
he

,
he
hope
I
have
at
last
bring
my
hog
to
a
fair
market
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
one
would
have
think
that
,
instead
of
be
owner
only
of
one
poor
little
pig

I
have
be
the
great
hog

merchant

Pray

Allworthy

"
do
not

so
particular

I
have
hear
nothing

many
year

Partridge
,
"
before
I
see
my
son

as
you
be
pleased
to
call
him

<EOS>
I
go
over

pass
that
over

<EOS>
"
then
,
sir

"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
it
be
about
half
a
year
ago
that
I
land
at
Bristol
,
where
I
staid
some
time
,
and
not
find
it
do
there
,
and
hearing
of
a
place
between
that
and
Gloucester
where
the
barber
be
just
dead
,
I
go
thither
,
and
there
I
have
be
about
two
month
when
Mr
Jones
come
thither
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
give
Allworthy
a
very
particular
account
of
their
first
meeting
,
and
of
everything
,
as
well
as
he
could
remember
,
which
have
happen
from
that
day
to
this
;
frequently
interlard
his
story
with
panegyric
on
Jones
,
and
not
forget
to
insinuate
the
great
love
and
respect
which
he
have
for
Allworthy
.
<EOS>
He
conclude
with
say
,
"
now
,
sir
,
I
have
tell
your
honour
the
whole
truth
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
repeat
a
most
solemn
protestation
,
"
that
he
be
no
more
the
father
of
Jones
than
of
the
Pope
of
Rome
;
"
and
imprecate
the
most
bitter
curse
on
his
head
,
if
he
do
not
speak
truth
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
I
to
think
of
this
matter
?
<EOS>
"
cry
Allworthy
.
<EOS>
"
for
what
purpose
should
you
so
strongly
deny
a
fact
which
I
think
it
would
be
rather
your
interest
to
own
?
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
sir
,
"
answer
Partridge
(
for
he
could
hold
no
longer
)
,
"
if
your
honour
will
not
believe
me
,
you
be
like
soon
to
have
satisfaction
enough
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
have
mistake
the
mother
of
this
young
man
,
as
well
as
you
have
his
father
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
now
be
ask
what
he
mean
,
with
all
the
symptom
of
horror
,
both
in
his
voice
and
countenance
,
he
tell
Allworthy
the
whole
story
,
which
he
have
a
little
before
express
such
desire
to
Mrs
Miller
to
conceal
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
be
almost
as
much
shock
at
this
discovery
as
Partridge
himself
have
be
while
he
relate
it
.
"
<EOS>
good
heaven
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
"
in
what
miserable
distress
do
vice
and
imprudence
involve

how
much
beyond

He
have
scarce
utter
these
word

when

hastily

abruptly
into

room

Mrs

without
pay
any
regard
to
what
Partridge
say

almost
without
take
any
notice
of
him

advanced
to
Mr
Allworthy
.
<EOS>

I
believe
,
sir

it
be
so
long
since

have
the
honour
of

you

not
recollect

"
indeed

Allworthy
,
"
you
be

very
much

business

bring
you
to

<EOS>
Allworthy
speak
this
with
great
reserve
;
for
the
reader
may
easily
believe
he
be
not
well
pleased
with
the
conduct
of
this
lady
;
neither
with
what
he
have
formerly
hear

nor
with
what

now

<EOS>
Mrs
Waters
answer
 
"
indeed
,
sir

I
have
very
particular
business
with
you

it
be
such
as
I
can
impart
only
to
yourself

<EOS>
I
must
desire
,
therefore
,
the
favour
of
a
word
with
you
alone

for
I
assure
you
what
I
have

Partridge
be
then

to
withdraw
,
but
before
he
go
,
he
beg
the
lady
to
satisfy
Mr

that
he
be
perfectly
innocent

to
which
she
answer
,
"
You

under
no

I
shall
satisfy
Mr

very
perfectly

a
few
moment
silent

not
refrain
from
say

then
,
"
say
Allworthy
,
"
ignorantly
punish
an
innocent
man
,
in
the
person
of
him
who
hath
just
leave
us
?
<EOS>
be
he
not
the
father
of
the
child
?
"
<EOS>
"
indeed
he
be
not
,
"
say
Mrs
Waters
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
pleased
to
remember
,
sir
,
I
formerly
tell
you
,
you
should
one
day
know
;
and
I
acknowledge
myself
to
have
be
guilty
of
a
cruel
neglect
,
in
not
have
discover
it
to
you
before
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
little
know
how
necessary
it
be
.
"
<EOS>
"
well
,
madam
,
"
say
Allworthy
,
"
be
pleased
to
proceed
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
must
remember
,
sir

"
say
she
,
"
a
young
fellow
,
whose
name
be
Summer

"
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
cry
Allworthy
,
"
he
be
the
son
of
a
clergyman
of
great
learning
and
virtue
,
for
whom
I
have
the
high
friendship
.
"
<EOS>
"
so
it
appear
,
sir
,
"
answer
she
;
<EOS>
"
for
I
believe
you
breed
the
young
man
up
,
and
maintain
him
at
the
university
;
where
,
I
think
,
he
have
finish
his
study
,
when
he
come
to
reside
at
your
house
;
a
fine
man
,
I
must
say
,
the
sun
never
shine
upon
;
for
,
besides
the
handsome
person
I
ever
see
,
he
be
so
genteel
,
and
have
so
much
wit
and
good
breeding

"
<EOS>
"
poor
gentleman
,
"
say
Allworthy
,
"
he
be
indeed
untimely
snatch
away
;
and
little
do
I
think
he
have
any
sin
of
this
kind
to
answer
for
;
for
I
plainly
perceive
you
be
go
to
tell
me
he
be
the
father
of
your
child

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed

answer
she
,
"
he
be
not

"
<EOS>
"
how
!
"
say
Allworthy
,
"
to
what
then
tend
all
this
preface
?
"
<EOS>
"
to
a
story
,
"
say
she
,
"
which
I
be
concerned
fall
to
my
lot
to
unfold
to
you
.
<EOS>
o
,
sir
!
<EOS>
prepare
to
hear
something
which
will
surprize
you
,
will
grieve
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
speak
,
"
say
Allworthy
,
"
I
be
conscious
of
no
crime
,
and
can
not
be
afraid
to
hear
.
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
she
,
"
that
Mr
Summer
,
the
son
of
your
friend

educate
at
your
expense
,
who
,
after
live
a
year
in
the
house

there
of
the
small

tenderly
lament
by
you

bury
as
if
he
have
be
your

that
Summer
,
sir
,
be
the
father
of
this
child

"
<EOS>
"
how
!
"
say
Allworthy
;
"
you
contradict
yourself
.
"
<EOS>
"
that
I
do
not
,
"
answer
she
;
"
he
be
indeed
the
father
of
this
child
,
but
not
by
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
take
care
,
madam
,
"
say
Allworthy
,
"
do
not
,
to
shun
the
imputation
of
any
crime
,
be
guilty
of
falshood
.
<EOS>
remember
there
be
one
from
whom
you
can
conceal
nothing
,
and
before
whose
tribunal
falshood
will
only
aggravate
your
guilt
.
"
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
sir
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
be
not
his
mother
;
nor
would
I
now
think
myself
so
for
the
world
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
know
your
reason
,
"
say
Allworthy
,
"
and
shall
rejoice
as
much
as
you
to
find
it
otherwise
;
yet
you
must
remember
,
you
yourself
confest
it
before
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
so
far
what
I
confest
,
"
say
she
,
"
be
true
,
that
these
hand
convey
the
infant
to
your
bed
;
convey
it
thither
at
the
command
of
its
mother
;
at
her
command
I
afterwards
own
it
,
and
think
myself
,
by
her
generosity
,
nobly
reward
,
both
for
my
secrecy
and
my
shame
.
"
<EOS>
"
who
could
this
woman
be
?
"
say
Allworthy
.
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
tremble
to
name
her
,
"
answer
Mrs
Waters
.
<EOS>
"
by
all
this
preparation
I
be
to
guess
that
she
be
a
relation
of
mine
,
"
cry
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
indeed
she
be
a
near
one
.
"
<EOS>
at
which
word
Allworthy
start
,
and
she
continue
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
sister
,
sir
.
"
<EOS>
"
a
sister
!
"
<EOS>
repeat
he
,
look
aghast
.
 
<EOS>
"
as
there
be
truth
in
heaven
,
"
cry
she
<EOS>
,
"
your
sister
be
the
mother
of
that
child
you
find
between
your
sheet
.
"
<EOS>
"
Can
it
be
possible
?
"
<EOS>
cry
he
,
"
good
heaven
!
"
<EOS>
"
have
patience
,
sir
,
"
say
Mrs
Waters
,
"
and
I
will
unfold
to
you
the
whole
story
.
<EOS>
just
after
your
departure
for
London
,
Miss
Bridget
come
one
day
to
the
house
of
my
mother
.
<EOS>
She
be
pleased
to
say
she
have
hear
an
extraordinary
character
of
me
,
for
my
learning
and
superior
understanding
to
all
the
young
woman
there
,
so
she
be
pleased
to
say
.
<EOS>
She
then
bid
me
come
to
her
to
the
great
house
;
where
,
when
I
attend
,
she
employ
me
to
read
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
express
great
satisfaction
in
my
reading
,
shew
great
kindness
to
me
,
and
make
me
many
present
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
begin
to
catechise
me
on
the
subject
of
secrecy
,
to
which
I
give
her
such
satisfactory
answer
,
that
,
at
last
,
have
lock
the
door
of
her
room
,
she
take
me
into
her
closet
,
and
then
lock
that
door
likewise
<EOS>
,
she
say
she
should
convince
me
of
the
vast
reliance
she
have
on
my
integrity
,
by
communicate
a
secret
in
which
her
honour
,
and
consequently
her
life
,
be
concerned
.
<EOS>
She
then
stopt
,
and
after
a
silence
of
a
few
minute
,
during
which
she
often
wipe
her
eye
,
she
enquire
of
me
if
I
think
my
mother
may
safely
be
confide
in
.
<EOS>
I
answer
,
I
would
stake
my
life
on
her
fidelity
.
<EOS>
She
then
impart
to
me
the
great
secret
which
labour
in
her
breast
,
and
which
,
I
believe
,
be
deliver
with
more
pain
than
she
afterwards
suffer
in
child
-
birth
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
contrive
that
my
mother
and
myself
only
should
attend
at
the
time
,
and
that
Mrs
Wilkins
should
be
send
out
of
the
way
,
as
she
accordingly
be
,
to
the
very
furth
part
of
Dorsetshire
,
to
enquire
the
character
of
a
servant
;
for
the
lady
have
turn
away
her
own
maid
near
three
month
before
;
during
all
which
time
I
officiate
about
her
person
upon
trial
,
as
she
say
,
though
,
as
she
afterwards
declare
,
I
be
not
sufficiently
handy
for
the
place
.
<EOS>
this
,
and
many
other
such
thing
which
she
use
to
say
of
me
,
be
all
throw
out
to
prevent
any
suspicion
which
Wilkins
may
hereafter
have
,
when
I
be
to
own
the
child
;
for
she
think
it
could
never
be
believe
she
would
venture
to
hurt
a
young
woman
with
whom
she
have
intrust
such
a
secret
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
assure
,
sir
,
I
be
well
pay
for
all
these
affront
,
which
,
together
with
be
inform
with
the
occasion
of
them
,
very
well
content
me
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
lady
have
a
great
suspicion
of
Mrs
Wilkins
than
of
any
other
person
;
not
that
she
have
the
least
aversion
to
the
gentlewoman
,
but
she
think
her
incapable
of
keep
a
secret
,
especially
from
you
,
sir
;
for
I
have
often
hear
Miss
Bridget
say
,
that
,
if
Mrs
Wilkins
have
commit
a
murder
,
she
believe
she
would
acquaint
you
with
it
.
<EOS>
at
last
the
expect
day
come
,
and
Mrs
Wilkins
,
who
have
be
keep
a
week
in
readiness
,
and
put
off
from
time
to
time
,
upon
some
pretence
or
other
,
that
she
may
not
return
too
soon
,
be
dispatch
.
<EOS>
then
the
child
be
bear
,
in
the
presence
only
of
myself
and
my
mother
,
and
be
by
my
mother
convey
to
her
own
house
,
where
it
be
privately
keep
by
her
till
the
evening
of
your
return
,
when
I
,
by
the
command
of
Miss
Bridget
,
convey
it
into
the
bed
where
you
find
it
.
<EOS>
and
all
suspicion
be
afterwards
lay
asleep
by
the
artful
conduct
of
your
sister
,
in
pretend
ill
-
will
to
the
boy
,
and
that
any
regard
she
shew
him
be
out
of
meer
complacence
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Waters
then
make
many
protestation
of
the
truth
of
this
story
,
and
conclude
by
say
,
"
thus
,
sir
,
you
have
at
last
discover
your
nephew
;
for
so
I
be
sure
you
will
hereafter
think
him
,
and
I
question
not
but
he
will
be
both
an
honour
and
a
comfort
to
you
under
that
appellation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
,
madam
,
"
say
Allworthy
,
"
express
my
astonishment
at
what
you
have
tell
me
;
and
yet
surely
you
would
not
,
and
could
not
,
have
put
together
so
many
circumstance
to
evidence
an
untruth
.
<EOS>
I
confess
I
recollect
some
passage
relate
to
that
Summer
,
which
formerly
give
me
a
conceit
that
my
sister
have
some
like
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
mention
it
to
her
;
for
I
have
such
a
regard
to
the
young
man
,
as
well
on
his
own
account
as
on
his
father
's
,
that
I
should
willingly
have
consent
to
a
match
between
them
;
but
she
exprest
the
high
disdain
of
my
unkind
suspicion
,
as
she
call
it
;
so
that
I
never
speak
more
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
good
heaven
!
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
the
Lord
disposeth
all
thing
.
 
<EOS>
yet
sure
it
be
a
most
unjustifiable
conduct
in
my
sister
to
carry
this
secret
with
her
out
of
the
world
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
promise
you
,
sir
,
"
say
Mrs
Waters
,
"
she
always
profest
a
contrary
intention
,
and
frequently
tell
me
she
intend
one
day
to
communicate
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
indeed
,
she
be
highly
rejoice
that
her
plot
have
succeed
so
well
,
and
that
you
have
of
your
own
accord
take
such
a
fancy
to
the
child
,
that
it
be
yet
unnecessary
to
make
any
express
declaration
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
sir
,
have
that
lady
live
to
have
see
this
poor
young
man
turn
like
a
vagabond
from
your
house
:
nay
,
sir
,
could
she
have
live
to
hear
that
you
have
yourself
employ
a
lawyer
to
prosecute
him
for
a
murder
of
which
he
be
not
guilty
 
<EOS>
forgive
me
,
Mr
Allworthy
,
I
must
say
it
be
unkind
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
you
have
be
abuse
,
he
never
deserve
it
of
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
madam
,
"
say
Allworthy
,
"
I
have
be
abuse
by
the
person
,
whoever
he
be
,
that
tell
you
so
.
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
sir
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
would
not
be
mistaken
,
I
do
not
presume
to
say
you
be
guilty
of
any
wrong
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
who
come
to
me
propose
no
such
matter
;
he
only
say
,
take
me
for
Mr
Fitzpatrick
's
wife
,
that
,
if
Mr
Jones
have
murder
my
husband
,
I
should
be
assist
with
any
money
I
want
to
carry
on
the
prosecution

by
a
very
worthy
gentleman
,
who
,
he
say
,
be
well
apprize
what
a
villain
<EOS>
I
have
to
deal
with
.
<EOS>
It
be
by
this
man
I
find
out
who
Mr
Jones

and
this
man
,
whose
name
be
dowle
<EOS>
,
Mr
Jones
tell
me
be
your
steward

<EOS>
I
discover
his
name
by
a
very
odd
accident
;
for
he
himself
refuse
to
tell
it
me
;
but
Partridge
,
who
meet
him
at
my
lodging
the
second
time
he
come
,
know
him
formerly
at
Salisbury
.

"
and
do
this

say
Allworthy
,
with
great
astonishment
in
his
countenance
,
"
tell
you
that
I
would
assist
in
the
prosecution
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no

answer
she
,
"
I
will
not
charge
him
wrongfully

<EOS>
He
say
I
should
be
assist

but
he
mention
no
name

<EOS>
yet
you
must
pardon
me

if
from
circumstance
I
think
it
could
be
no
other

"
 
<EOS>

indeed

Allworthy
,
"
from
circumstance
I
be
too
well
convinced
it
be
another

<EOS>
good

by
what
wonderful

him
every
minute

<EOS>
nay

he
may
be

perhaps

already
in

house

<EOS>
Allworthy
then
stept
to
the
door
,
in
order
to
call
a
servant

when
in
come

Supple

be
else
?
<EOS>
I

shall
live
in

I

"
<EOS>

but
suppose

say
Western
,
"
she
should
run
away
with

?
<EOS>
for
lawyer

"
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Mr
Western
be
go
Mrs
Waters
say
,
"
I
see
,
<EOS>
sir
,
<EOS>
the
squire
hath
not
the
least
remembrance
of
my
face

<EOS>
I
believe
,
Mr
Allworthy
,
you
would
not
have
know
me
neither
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
considerably
alter
since
that
day
when
you
so
kindly
give
me
that
advice
,
which
I
have
be
happy
<EOS>
have
I
follow
.
"
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
madam
,
"
cry
Allworthy
,
"
it
give
me
great
concern
when
I
first
hear
the
contrary
.
"
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
sir
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
be
ruin
by
a
very
deep
scheme
of
villany
,
which
if
you
know
,
though
I
pretend
not
to
think
it
would
justify
me
in
your
opinion
,
it
would
at
least
mitigate
my
offence
,
and
induce
you
to
pity
me
<EOS>
:
you
be
not
now
at
leisure
to
hear
my
whole
story
;
but
this
I
assure
you
,
<EOS>
I
be
betray
by
the
most
solemn
promise
of
marriage
;
nay
,
in
the
eye
of
heaven
I
be
married
to
him
;
for
,
after
much
reading
on
the
subject
,
I
be
convinced
that
particular
ceremony
be
only
requisite
to
give
a
legal
sanction
to
marriage
,
and
have
only
a
worldly
use
in
give
a
woman
the
privilege
of
a
wife
;
but
that
she
who
live
constant
to
one
man
,
after
a
solemn
private
affiance
,
whatever
the
world
may
call
her
,
hath
little
to
charge
on
her
own
conscience
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
,
madam
,
"
say
Allworthy
,
"
you
make
so
ill
<EOS>
a
use
of
your
learning
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
would
have
be
well
that
you
have
be
possess
of
much
more
,
or
have
remain
in
a
state
of
ignorance
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
madam
,
I
be
afraid
you
have
more
than
this
sin
to
answer
for
.
"
<EOS>
"
during
his
life
,
"
answer
she
,
"
which
be
above
a
dozen
year
<EOS>
,
I
most
solemnly
assure
you
I
have
not
.
<EOS>
and
consider
,
sir
,
on
my
behalf
,
what
be
in
the
power
of
a
woman
stript
of
her
reputation
and
leave
destitute
;
whether
the
good
-
natured
world
will
suffer
such
a
stray
sheep
to
return
to
the
road
of
virtue
,
even
if
she
be
never
so
desirous
.
<EOS>
I
protest
,
then
,
I
would
have
choose
it
have
it
be
in
my
power
;
but
necessity
drive
me
into
the
arm
of
Captain
Waters
,
with
whom
,
though
still
unmarried
,
I
live
as
a
wife
for
many
year
,
and
go
by
his
name
.
<EOS>
I
part
with
this
gentleman
at
Worcester
,
on
his
march
against
the
rebel
,
and
it
be
then
I
accidentally
meet
with
Mr
Jones
,
who
rescue
me
from
the
hand
of
a
villain
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
be
the
worthy
of
man
.
<EOS>
no
young
gentleman
of
his
age
be
,
I
believe
,
free
from
vice
,
and
few
have
the
twentieth
part
of
his
virtue
;
nay
,
whatever
vice
<EOS>
he
hath
have
<EOS>
,
I
be
firmly
persuade
he
hath
now
take
a
resolution
to
abandon
them
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
hath
,
"
cry
Allworthy
,
"
and
I
hope
he
will
preserve
that
resolution
.
<EOS>
I
must
say
,
I
have
still
the
same
hope
with
regard
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
the
world
,
I
do
agree
,
be
apt
to
be
too
unmerciful
on
these
occasion
;
yet
time
and
perseverance
will
get
the
well
of
this
their
disinclination
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
to
pity
;
for
though
they
be
not
,
like
heaven
,
ready
to
receive
a
penitent
sinner
;
yet
a
continue
repentance
will
at
length
obtain
mercy
even
with
the
world
.
<EOS>
this
you
may
be
assure
of
,
Mrs
Waters
,
that
whenever
I
find
you
be
sincere
in
such
good
intention
,
you
shall
want
no
assistance
in
my
power
to
make
them
effectual
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Waters
fall
now
upon
her
knee
before
him
,
and
,
in
a
flood
of
tear
,
make
him
many
most
passionate
acknowledgment
of
his
goodness
,
which
,
as
she
truly
say
,
savour
more
of
the
divine
than
human
nature
.
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
raise
her
up
,
and
speak
in
the
most
tender
manner
,
make
use
of
every
expression
which
his
invention
could
suggest
to
comfort
her
,
when
he
be
interrupt
by
the
arrival
of
Mr
Dowling
,
who
,
upon
his
first
entrance
,
see
Mrs
Waters
,
start
,
and
appear
in
some
confusion
;
from
which
he
soon
recover
himself
as
well
as
he
could
,
and
then
say
he
be
in
the
utmost
haste
to
attend
counsel
at
Mr
Western
's
lodging
;
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
think
it
his
duty
to
call
and
acquaint
him
with
the
opinion
of
counsel
upon
the
case
which
he
have
before
tell
him
,
which
be
that
the
conversion
of
the
money
in
that
case
could
not
be
question
in
a
criminal
cause
,
but
that
an
action
of
trover
may
be
bring
,
and
if
it
appear
to
the
jury
to
be
the
money
of
plaintiff
,
that
plaintiff
would
recover
a
verdict
for
the
value
.
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
,
without
make
any
answer
to
this
,
bolt
the
door
,
and
then
,
advance
with
a
stern
look
to
Dowling
,
he
say
,
"
whatever
be
your

Allworthy
stand
a
minute
silent
,
lift
up
his

;

then
,
turn
to
Dowling

,
"
how
come

not
to

this

Your

must
remember
that
you
be
at

ill
in

be
in

violent

indeed
I
always
be
,
I
deliver
the

message
to
Mr

tell

he
would
carry
them
both

he
do

that
your

out
of

out
of
regard

would
never

if

I

I

never

to

"
  
<EOS>
We
have
remark
somewhere
already
,
that
it
be
possible
for
a
man
to
convey
a
lie
in
the
word
of
truth
;
this
be
the
case
at
present
;
for
Blifil
have
,
in
fact
,
tell
dowle
what
he
now
relate
,
but
have
not
impose
upon
him
,
nor
indeed
have
imagine
he
be
able
so
to
do
.
<EOS>
in
reality
,
the
promise
which
Blifil
have
make
to
Dowling
be
the
motive
which
have
induce
him
to
secrecy
;
and
,
as
he
now
very
plainly
see
Blifil
would
not
be
able
to
keep
them
,
he
think
proper
now
to
make
this
confession
,
which
the
promise
of
forgiveness
,
join
to
the
threat
,
the
voice
,
the
look
of
Allworthy
,
and
the
discovery
he
have
make
before
,
extort
from
him
,
who
be
besides
take
unaware
,
and
have
no
time
to
consider
of
evasion
.
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
appear
well
satisfied
with
this
relation
,
and
,
have
enjoin
on
dowling
strict
silence
as
to
what
have
past
,
conduct
that
gentleman
himself
to
the
door
,
lest
he
should
see
Blifil
,
who
be
return
to
his
chamber
,
where
he
exult
in
the
thought
of
his
last
deceit
on
his
uncle
,
and
little
suspected
what
have
since
pass
below
-
stair
.
  
<EOS>
as
Allworthy
be
return
to
his
room
he
meet
Mrs
Miller
in
the
entry
,
who
,
with
a
face
all
pale
and
full
of
terror
,
say
to
him
,
"
o
!
<EOS>
sir
,
I
find
this
wicked
woman
hath
be
with
you
,
and
you
know
all
;
yet
do
not
on
this
account
abandon
the
poor
young
man
.
<EOS>
consider
,
sir
,
he
be
ignorant
<EOS>
it
be
his
own
mother
;
and
the
discovery
itself
will
most
probably
break
his
heart
,
without
your
unkindness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
say
Allworthy
,
"
I
be
under
such
an
astonishment
at
what
I
have
hear

that
I
be
really
unable
to
satisfy
you
;
but
come
with
me
into
my
room
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
Mrs
Miller
,
I
have
make
surprizing
discovery
,
and
you
shall
soon
know
them

<EOS>
the
poor
woman
follow
him
tremble
;
and
now
Allworthy
,
go
up
to
Mrs
Waters
,
take
her
by
the
hand
,
and
then
,
turn
to
Mrs
Miller
,
say
,
"
what
reward
shall
I
bestow
upon
this
gentlewoman
,
for
the
service
<EOS>
she
hath
do
me
?
 
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
Mrs
Miller
,
you
have
a
thousand
time
hear
me
call
the
young
man
to
whom
you
be
so
faithful

friend
,
my
son
.
<EOS>
little
do
I
then
think
he
be
indeed
relate
to
me
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Your
friend
,
madam
,
be
my
nephew
;
he
be
the
brother
of
that
wicked
viper
which
I
have
so
long
nourish
in
my
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
herself
tell
you
the
whole
story
,
and
how
the
youth
come
to
pass
for
her
son
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
Mrs
Miller
,
I
be
convinced
that
he
hath
be
wrong
,
and
that
I
have
be
abuse
;
abuse
by
one
whom
you
too
justly
suspect
of
be
a
villain
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
in
truth
,
the
bad
of
villain
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
joy
which
Mrs
Miller
now
feel
bereft
her
of
the
power
of
speech
,
and
may
perhaps
have
deprive
her
of
her
sense
,
if
not
of
life
,
have
not
a
friendly
shower
of
tear
come
seasonably
to
her
relief
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
recover
so
far
from
her
transport
as
to
be
able
to
speak
,
she
cry
,
"
and
be
my
dear
Mr
Jones
then
your
nephew
,
sir
,
and
not
the
son
of
this
lady
?
<EOS>
and
be
your
eye
open
to
him
at
last
?
<EOS>
and
shall
I
live
to
see
him
as
happy
as
he
deserve

"
<EOS>
"
He
certainly
be
my

Allworthy

I
hope
all
the

<EOS>
"
why

then

cry
Mrs

,
upon
her
knee
,
"
may
Heaven
shower
down
its
choice
blessing
upon
her
head

sin

never
so
many

<EOS>
Mrs
Waters
then
inform
them
that
she
believe
Jones
would
very
shortly
be
release
;
for
that
the
surgeon
be
go
,
in
company
with
a
nobleman
,
to
the
justice
who
commit
him
,
in
order
to
certify
that
Mr
Fitzpatrick
be
out
of
all
manner
of
danger
,
and
to
procure
his
prisoner
his
liberty
.
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
say
he
should
be
glad
to
find
his
nephew
there
at
his
return
home
;
but
that
he
be
then
oblige
to
go
on
some
business
of
consequence
.
<EOS>
He
then
call
to
a
servant
to
fetch
him
a
chair
,
and
presently
leave
the
two
lady
together
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Blifil
,
hear
the
chair
order
,
come
downstairs
to
attend
upon
his
uncle
;
for
he
never
be
deficient
in
such
act
of
duty
.
<EOS>
He
ask
his
uncle
if
he
be
go
out
,
which
be
a
civil
way
of
ask
a
man
whither
<EOS>
he
be
go
:
to
which
the
other
make
no
answer
,
he
again
desire
to
know
when
he
would
be
pleased
to
return
?
 
<EOS>
Allworthy
make
no
answer
to
this
neither
,
till
he
be
just
go
into
his
chair
,
and
then
,
turn
about
,
he
say
 
"
Harkee
,
sir
,
do
you
find
out
,
before
my
return
,
the
letter
which
your
mother
send
me
on
her
death

bed

"
<EOS>
Allworthy
then
depart
,
and
leave
Blifil
in
a
situation
to
be
envy
only
by
a
man
who
be
just
go
to
be

<EOS>
a
further
continuation
.
 
<EOS>
Allworthy
take
an
opportunity
,
whilst
he
be
in
the
chair
,
of
read
the
letter
from
Jones
to
Sophia
,
which
Western
deliver
him
;
and
there
be
some
expression
in
it
concern
himself
which
draw
tear
from
his
eye
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
arrive
at
Mr
Western

,
and
be
introduce
to
Sophia
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
first
ceremony
be
past
,
and
the
gentleman
and
lady
have
take
their
chair
,
a
silence
of
some
minute
ensue
;
during
which
the
latter
,
who
have
be
prepare
for
the
visit
by
her
father
,
sit
play
with
her
fan
,
and
have
every
mark
of
confusion
both
in
her
countenance
and
behaviour
.
<EOS>
at
length
Allworthy
,
who
be
himself
a
little
disconcerted
,
begin
thus
:
"
I
be
afraid
,
Miss
Western
,
my
family
hath
be
the
occasion
of
give
you
some
uneasiness
;
to
which
,
I
fear
,
I
have
innocently
become
more
instrumental
than
I
intend
.
<EOS>
be
assure
,
madam
,
have
I
at
first
know
how
disagreeable
the
proposal
have
be
,
I
should
not
have
suffer
you
to
have
be
so
long
persecute
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
therefore
,
you
will
not
think
the
design
of
this
visit
be
to
trouble
you
with
any
further
solicitation
of
that
kind
,
but
entirely
to
relieve
you
from
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
Sophia
,
with
a
little
modest
hesitation
,
"
this
behaviour
be
most
kind
and
generous
,
and
such
as
I
could
expect
only
from
Mr
Allworthy
;
but
as
you
have
be
so
kind
to
mention
this
matter
,
you
will
pardon
me
for
say
it
hath
,
indeed
,
give
me
great
uneasiness
,
and
hath
be
the
occasion
of
my
suffer
much
cruel
treatment
from
a
father
who
be
,
till
that
unhappy
affair
,
the
tender
and
fond
of
all
parent
.
<EOS>
I
be
convinced
,
sir
,
you
be
too
good
and
generous
to
resent
my
refusal
of
your
nephew
.
<EOS>
Our
inclination
be
not
in
our
own
power
;
and
whatever
may
be
his
merit
,
I
can
not
force
them
in
his
favour
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
most
amiable
young
lady
,
"
say
Allworthy
,
"
I
be
capable
of
no
such
resentment
,
have
the
person
be
my
own
son
,
and
have
I
entertain
the
high
esteem
for
him
.
<EOS>
for
you
say
truly
,
madam
,
we
can
not
force
our
inclination
,
much
less
<EOS>
can
they
be
direct
by
another
.
"
<EOS>
"
oh
!
sir
,
"
answer
Sophia
,
"
every
word
you
speak
prove
you
deserve
that
good
,
that
great
,
that
benevolent
character
the
whole
world
allow
you
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
sir
,
nothing
less
than
the
certain
prospect
of
future
misery
could
have
make
me
resist
the
command
of
my
father
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
sincerely
believe
you
,
madam
,
"
reply
Allworthy
,
"
and
I
heartily
congratulate
you
on
your
prudent
foresight
,
since
by
so
justifiable
a
resistance
you
have
avoid
misery
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
"
You
speak
now
,
Mr
Allworthy
,
"
cry
she
,
"
with
a
delicacy
which
few
man
be
capable
of
feel
!
<EOS>
but
surely
,
in
my
opinion
,
to
lead
our
life
with
one
to
whom
we
be
indifferent
must
be
a
state
of
wretchedness
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
that
wretchedness
would
be
even
increase
by
a
sense
of
the
merit
of
an
object
to
whom
we
can
not
give
our
affection

my
interrupting

the
supposition

Miss
Western

I
rejoice
from

Miss

I

<EOS>
His
character

the
obligation
I
have
just

from
him

demand
it

<EOS>
I
have
determine
at

to
listen
to
no
such
proposal

<EOS>
My
only
desire
be
to
be
restore
to
the
affection

to
be
again
the
mistress

I

to
owe
to
your

conjure
you

by
all
the

I

the

persecution

engage
me
in
another
as
miserable

as
fruitless

<EOS>

indeed
,
Miss
Western

"
reply
Allworthy
,
"
I
be
capable
of
no
such
conduct

if
this

your

must
submit
to
the
disappointment
,
whatever
torment
he
may
suffer
under
it

<EOS>

I
must
smile
now

when
you

the

I
begin
now
to
be
afraid

<EOS>
I
be
much
more
ashamed

I

you

the

I

whatever
his
apprehension

if
I

I
have
give
no

it

always

principle

never

<EOS>
this
be

I

the
duty

this

I
hope

nothing
could
ever
have
prevail

swerve
from

<EOS>
I
do
not

conceive
that
the
authority

can
oblige

to
avoid

I
leave

surely
there
be
more
in

I
be
cautious

It

you

alas

<EOS>
sir

I
have
not

punish
more
than
I
have
deserve
;
and
it
shall
be
the
whole
business
of
my
future
life
to
deserve
that
happiness
you
now
bestow
on

for
,
believe
me
,
my

my
punishment
hath
not
be
throw
away
upon
me
:
<EOS>
though
I
have
be
a
great
,
I
be
not
a
hardened
sinner
;
I
thank
Heaven
,
I
have
have
time
to
reflect
on
my
past
life
,
where
,
though
I
can
not
charge
myself
with
any
gross
villany
,
yet
I
can
discern
folly
and
vice
more
than
enough
to
repent
and
to
be
ashamed
of
;
folly
which
have
be
attend
with
dreadful
consequence
to
myself
,
and
have
bring
me
to
the
brink
of
destruction
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
be
rejoice
,
my
dear
child
,
"
answer
Allworthy
,
"
to
hear
you
talk
thus
sensibly
;
for
as
I
be
convince
hypocrisy
(
good
Heaven
!
<EOS>
how
have
I
be
impose
on
by
it
in
other
!
)
<EOS>
be
never
among
your
fault
,
so
I
can
readily
believe
all
you
say
.
<EOS>
You
now
see
,
Tom
,
to
what
danger
imprudence
alone
may
subject
virtue
(
for
virtue
,
I
be
now
convinced
,
you
love
in
a
great
degree
)
.
<EOS>
prudence
be
indeed
the
duty
which
we
owe
to
ourselves
;
and
if
we
will
be
so
much
our
own
enemy
as
to
neglect
it
,
we
be
not
to
wonder
if
the
world
be
deficient
in
discharge
their
duty
to
us
;
for
when
a
man
lay
the
foundation
of
his
own
ruin
,
other
will
,
I
be
afraid
,
be
too
apt
to
build
upon
it
.
<EOS>
You
say
,
however
,
you
have
see
your
error
,
and
will
reform
them
.
<EOS>
I
firmly
believe
you
,
my
dear
child
;
and
therefore
,
from
this
moment
,
you
shall
never
be
remind
of
them
by
me
.
<EOS>
remember
them
only
yourself
so
far
as
for
the
future
to
teach
you
the
well
to
avoid
them
;
but
still
remember
,
for
your
comfort
,
that
there
be
this
great
difference
between
those
fault
which
candor
may
construe
into
imprudence
,
and
those
which
can
be
deduce
from
villany
only
.
<EOS>
the
former
,
perhaps
,
be
even
more
apt
to
subject
a
man
to
ruin
;
but
if
he
reform
,
his
character
will
,
at
length
,
be
totally
retrieve
;
the
world
,
though
not
immediately
,
will
in
time
be
reconcile
to
him
;
and
he
may
reflect
,
not
without
some
mixture
of
pleasure
,
on
the
danger
he
hath
escape
;
but
villany
,
my
boy
,
when
once
discover
be
irretrievable
;
the
stain
which
this
leave
behind
,
no
time
will
wash
away
.
<EOS>
the
censure
of
mankind
will
pursue
the
wretch
,
their
scorn
will
abash
him
in
publick
;
and
if
shame
drive
him
into
retirement
,
he
will
go
to
it
with
all
those
terror
with
which
a
weary
child
,
who
be
afraid
of
hobgoblin
,
retreat
from
company
to
go
to
bed
alone
.
<EOS>
here
his
murder
conscience
will
haunt
him
.
 
<EOS>
Repose
,
like
a
false
friend
,
will
fly
from
him
.
<EOS>
wherever
he
turn
his
eye
,
horror
present
itself
;
if
he
look
backward
,
unavailable
repentance
tread
on
his
heel
;
if
forward
,
incurable
despair
stare
him
in
the
face
,
till
,
like
a
condemn
prisoner
confine
in
a
dungeon
,
he
detest
his
present
condition
,
and
yet
dread
the
consequence
of
that
hour
which
be
to
relieve
him
from
it
.
<EOS>
comfort
yourself
,
I
say
,
my
child
,
that
this
be
not
your
case
;
and
rejoice
with
thankfulness
to
him
who
hath
suffer
you
to
see
your
error
,
before
they
have
bring
on
you
that
destruction
to
which
a
persistance
in
even
those
error
must
have
lead
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
desert
them
;
and
the
prospect
now
before
you
be
such
,
that
happiness
seem
in
your
own
power

<EOS>
"
at
these
word
Jones
fetch
a
deep
sigh
;
upon
which
,
when
Allworthy
remonstrate
,
he
say
,
"
Sir
,
I
will
conceal
nothing
from
you

I
fear
there
be
one
consequence

my
vice
I
shall
never
be
able
to
retrieve

have
lose
a
treasure

<EOS>
"
You
need
say
no
more

answer
Allworthy
;
"
I
will
be
explicit
with
you
;
I
know
what
you
lament
;
I
have
see
the
young
lady
,
and
have
discourse
with
her
concern
you
.
<EOS>
this
I
must
insist
on
,
as
an
earnest
of
your
sincerity
in
all
you
have
say
,
and
of
the
stedfastness
of
your
resolution
,
that
you
obey
me
in
one
instance

<EOS>
to
abide
intirely
by
the
determination
of
the
young
lady
,
whether
it
shall
be
in
your
favour
or
no

<EOS>
She
hath
already
suffer
enough
from
solicitation
which
I
hate
to
think
of
;
she
shall
owe
no
further
constraint
to
my
family
:
<EOS>
I
know
her
father
will
be
as
ready
to
torment
her
now
on
your
account
as
he
hath
formerly
be
on
another
be
;
but
I
be
determined
she
shall
suffer
no
more
confinement
,
no
more
violence
,
no
more
uneasy
hour

<EOS>
"
o
,
my
dear
uncle

answer
Jones
,
"
lie
,
I
beseech
you
,
some
command
on
me
,
in
which
I
shall
have
some
merit
in
obedience
.
<EOS>
believe
me
,
sir
,
the
only
instance
in
which
I
could
disobey
you
would
be
to
give
an
uneasy
moment
to
my
Sophia

<EOS>
no

sir

if
I
be
so
miserable
to
have
incur
her
displeasure
beyond
all
hope
of
forgiveness

that
alone

with
the
dreadful
reflection
of
cause
her
misery

will
be
sufficient

<EOS>
to
call
Sophia
mine
be
the
great
,

now
the
only
additional
blessing

will
not
flatter
you

Allworthy

I
fear
your

his
eagerness

the
afternoon

upon
which
Jones

be
full

beg
his

entertain
Western

Mrs

joy

joy

anything
so
inexorable
I

"
  
<EOS>
Jones
,
with
some
appearance
of
surprize
,
ask
her
what
she
mean
.
<EOS>
"
why
then
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
have
be
with
your
young
lady
,
and
have
explain
all
matter
to
her
,
as
they
be
tell
to
me
by
my
son
Nightingale
.
<EOS>
She
can
have
no
longer
any
doubt
about
the
letter
;
of
that
I
be
certain
;
for
I
tell
her
my
son
Nightingale
be
ready
to
take
his
oath
,
if
she
please
,
that
it
be
all
his
own
invention
,
and
the
letter
of
his
inditing
.
<EOS>
I
tell
her
the
very
reason
of
send
the
letter
ought
to
recommend
you
to
her
the
more
,
as
it
be
all
upon
her
account
,
and
a
plain
proof
that
you
be
resolve
to
quit
all
your
profligacy
for
the
future
;
that
you
have
never
be
guilty
of
a
single
instance
of
infidelity
to
her
since
your
see
her
in
town
:
I
be
afraid
I
go
too
far
there
;
but
Heaven
forgive
me
!
<EOS>
I
hope
your
future
behaviour
will
be
my
justification

<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
have
say
all
I
can
;
but
all
to
no
purpose

<EOS>
She
remain
inflexible
.
<EOS>
She
say
,
she
have
forgive
many
fault
on
account
of
youth
;
but
express
such
detestation
of
the
character
of
a
libertine
,
that
she
absolutely
silence
me
.
<EOS>
I
often
attempt
to
excuse
you
;
but
the
justness
of
her
accusation
fly
in
my
face

<EOS>
upon
my
honour
,
she
be
a
lovely
woman
,
and
one
of
the
sweetest
and
most
sensible
creature
I
ever
see
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
almost
kiss
her
for
one
expression
she
make
use
of
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
sentiment
worthy
of
Seneca
,

of
a
bishop
.
<EOS>
"
I
once
fancy
madam
.
<EOS>
"
and
she
,
"
I
have
discover
great
goodness
of
heart
in
Mr
Jones
;
and
for
that
I
own
I
have
a
sincere
esteem
;
but
an
entire
profligacy
of
manner
will
corrupt
the
good
heart
in
the
world
;
and
all
which
a
good
-
natured
libertine
can
expect
be
,
that
we
should
mix
some
grain
of
pity
with
our
contempt
and
abhorrence
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
an
angelic
creature
,
that
be
the
truth
on't
.

<EOS>
"
o
,
Mrs
Miller
!

answer
Jones
,
"
can
I
bear
to
think
that
I
have
lose
such
an
angel
?
"
<EOS>
"
lose
!
<EOS>
no
,
"
cry
Mrs
Miller
;
"
I
hope
you
have
not
lose
her
yet

<EOS>
resolve
to
leave
such
vicious
course
,
and
you
may
yet
have
hope
,
nay
,
if
she
would
remain
inexorable
,
there
be
another
young
lady
,
a
sweet
pretty
young
lady
,
and
a
swinge
fortune

who
be
absolutely
die
for
love
of
you

<EOS>
I
hear
of
it
this
very
morning
,
and
I
tell
it
to
Miss
Western
;
<EOS>
nay
,
I
go
a
little
beyond
the
truth
again
;
for
I
tell
her
you
have
refuse
her
;
but
indeed
I
know
you
would
refuse
her

and
here
I
must
give
you
a
little
comfort
;
when
I
mention
the
young
lady
's
name

who
be
no
other
than
the
pretty
widow
Hunt

I
think
she
turn
pale
;

when
I
say
you
have
refuse
her
,
I
will
be
swear
<EOS>
her
face
be
all
over
scarlet
in
an
instant
;
and
these
be
her
very
word
:
"
I
will
not
deny
but
that
I
believe
he
have
some
affection
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
the
conversation
be
interrupt
by
the
arrival
of
Western
,
who
could
no
longer
be
keep
out
of
the
room
even
by
the
authority
of
Allworthy
himself
;
though
this
,
as
we
have
often
see
,
have
a
wonderful
power
over
him
.
  
<EOS>
Western
immediately
go
up
to
Jones
,
cry
out
,
"
My
old
friend
Tom
<EOS>
,
I
be
glad
to
see
thee
with
all
my
heart
!
<EOS>
all
past
must
be
forget
;
I
could
not
intend
any
affront
to
thee
,
because
,
as
Allworthy
here
know
,
nay
,
dost
know
it
thyself
<EOS>
,
I
take
thee
for
another
person
;
and
where
a
body
mean
no
harm
,
what
signify
a
hasty
word
or
two
?
<EOS>
one
Christian
must
forget
and
forgive
another
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
sir
,
"
say
Jones
,
"
I
shall
never
forget
the
many
obligation
I
have
have
to
you
;
but
as
for
any
offence
towards
me
,
I
declare
I
be
an
utter
stranger
.
"
<EOS>
"
A't
,
"
say
Western
,
"
then
give
me
thy
fist
;
a't
as
hearty
an
honest
cock
as
any
in
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
come
along
with
me
;
I
will
carry
thee
to
thy
mistress
this
moment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
Allworthy
interpose
;
and
the
squire
be
unable
to
prevail
either
with
the
uncle
or
nephew
,
be
,
after
some
litigation
,
oblige
to
consent
to
delay
introduce
Jones
to
Sophia
till
the
afternoon
;
<EOS>
at
which
time
Allworthy
,
as
well
in
compassion
to
Jones
as
in
compliance
with
the
eager
desire
of
Western
,
be
prevail
upon
to
promise
to
attend
at
the
tea
-
table
.
  
<EOS>
the
conversation
which
now
ensue
be
pleasant
enough
;
and
with
which
,
have
it
happen
earlier
in
our
history
,
we
would
have
entertain
our
reader
;
but
as
we
have
now
leisure
only
to
attend
to
what
be
very
material
,
it
shall
suffice
to
say
that
matter
be
entirely
adjust
as
to
the
afternoon
visit
Mr
Western
again
return
home
.
    
<EOS>
the
history
draw
nearer
to
a
conclusion
.
 
<EOS>
when
Mr
Western
be
depart
,
Jones
begin
to
inform
Mr
Allworthy
and
Mrs
Miller
that
his
liberty
have
be
procure
by
two
noble
lord
,
who
,
together
with
two
surgeon
and
a
friend
of
Mr
Nightingale
's
,
have
attend
the
magistrate
by
whom
he
have
be
commit
,
and
by
whom
,
on
the
surgeon
'
oath
,
that
the
wounded
person
be
out
of
all
manner
of
danger
from
his
wound
,
he
be
discharge
.
  
<EOS>
one
only
of
these
lord
,
he
say
,
he
have
ever
see
before
,
and
that
no
more
than
once
;
but
the
other
have
greatly
surprize
him
by
ask
his
pardon
for
an
offence
he
have
be
guilty
of
towards
him
,
occasion
,
he
say
,
entirely
by
his
ignorance
who
he
be
.
  
<EOS>
now
the
reality
of
the
case
,
with
which
Jones
be
not
acquaint
till
afterwards
,
be
this
:
 
the
lieutenant
whom
Lord
Fellamar
have
employ
,
accord
to
the
advice
of
Lady
Bellaston
,
to
press
Jones
as
a
vagabond
into
the
sea
-
service
,
when
he
come
to
report
to
his
lordship
the
event
which
we
have
before
see
,
speak
very
favourably
of
the
behaviour
of
Mr
Jones
on
all
account
,
and
strongly
assure
that
lord
that
he
must
have
mistake
the
person
,
for
that
Jones
be
certainly
a
gentleman
;
insomuch
that
his
lordship
,
who
be
strictly
a
man
of
honour
,
and
would
by
no
means
have
be
guilty
of
an
action
which
the
world
in
general
would
have
condemn
,
begin
to
be
much
concern
for
the
advice
which
he
have
take
.
  
<EOS>
within
a
day
or
two
after
this
,
Lord
Fellamar
happen
to
dine
with
the
irish
peer
,
who
,
in
a
conversation
upon
the
duel
,
acquaint
his
company
with
the
character
of
Fitzpatrick
;
to
which
,
indeed
,
he
do
not
do
strict
justice
,
especially
in
what
relate
to
his
lady
.
<EOS>
He
say
she
be
the
most
innocent
,
the
most
injured
woman
alive
,
and
that
from
compassion
alone
he
have
undertake
her
cause
.
<EOS>
He
then
declare
an
intention
of
go
the
next
morning
to
Fitzpatrick
's
lodging
,
in
order
to
prevail
with
him
,
if
possible
,
to
consent
to
a
separation
from
his
wife
,
who
,
the
peer
say
,
be
in
apprehension
for
her
life
,
if
she
should
ever
return
to
be
under
the
power
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fellamar
agree
to
go
with
him
,
that
he
may
satisfy
himself
more
concern
Jones
and
the
circumstance
of
the
duel
;
for
he
be
by
no
mean
easy
concern
the
part
he
have
act
.
<EOS>
the
moment
his
lordship
give
a
hint
of
his
readiness
to
assist
in
the
delivery
of
the
lady
,
it
be
eagerly
embrace
by
the
other
nobleman
,
who
depend
much
on
the
authority
of
Lord
Fellamar
,
as
he
think
it
would
greatly
contribute
to
awe
Fitzpatrick
into
a
compliance
;
and
perhaps
he
be
in
the
right
;
for
the
poor
Irishman
no
sooner
see
these
noble
peer
have
undertake
the
cause
of
his
wife
than
he
submit
,
and
article
of
separation
be
soon
draw
up
and
sign
between
the
party
.
  
<EOS>
Fitzpatrick
,
who
have
be
so
well
satisfied
by
Mrs
Waters
concern
the
innocence
of
his
wife
with
Jones
at
Upton
,
or
perhaps
,
from
some
other
reason
,
be
now
become
so
indifferent
to
that
matter
,
that
he
speak
highly
in
favour
of
Jones
to
Lord
Fellamar
,
take
all
the
blame
upon
himself
,
and
say
the
other
have
behave
very
much
like
a
gentleman
and
a
man
of
honour
;
and
upon
that
lord
's
further
enquiry
concern
Mr
Jones
,
Fitzpatrick
tell
him
he
be
nephew
to
a
gentleman
of
very
great
fashion
and
fortune
,
which
be
the
account
he
have
just
receive
from
Mrs
Waters
after
her
interview
with
Dowling
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Fellamar
now
think
it
behove
him
to
do
everything
in
his
power
to
make
satisfaction
to
a
gentleman
whom
he
have
so
grossly
injure
,
and
without
any
consideration
of
rivalship
(
for
he
have
now
give
over
all
thought
of
Sophia
)
,
determine
to
procure
Mr
Jones
's
liberty
,
be
satisfy
,
as
well
from
Fitzpatrick
as
his
surgeon
,
that
the
wound
be
not
mortal
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
prevail
with
the
irish
peer
to
accompany
him
to
the
place
where
Jones
be
confine
,
to
whom
he
behave
as
we
have
already
relate
.
  
<EOS>
when
Allworthy
return
to
his
lodging
,
he
immediately
carry
Jones
into
his
room
,
and
then
acquaint
him
with
the
whole
matter
,
as
well
what
he
have
hear
from
Mrs
Waters
as
what
he
have
discover
from
Mr
Dowling
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
express
great
astonishment
and
no
less
concern
at
this
account
,
but
without
make
any
comment
or
observation
upon
it
.
<EOS>
and
now
a
message
be
bring
from
Mr
Blifil
,
desire
to
know
if
his
uncle
be
at
leisure
that
he
may
wait
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Allworthy
start
and
turn
pale
,
and
then
in
a
more
passionate
tone
than
I
believe
he
have
ever
use
before
,
bid
the
servant
<EOS>
tell
Blifil
<EOS>
he
know
him
not
.
<EOS>
"
consider
,
dear
sir
,
"
cry
Jones
,
in
a
tremble
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
consider
,
"
answer
Allworthy
,
"
and
you
yourself
shall
carry
my
message
to
the
villain
.
<EOS>
no
one
can
carry
him
the
sentence
of
his
own
ruin
so
properly
as
the
man
whose
ruin
he
hath
so
villanously
contrived
.
"
<EOS>
"
pardon
me
,
dear
sir
,
"
say
Jones
;
"
a
moment
's
reflection
will
,
I
be
sure
,
convince
you
of
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
what
may
perhaps
be
but
justice
from
another
tongue
,
would
from
mine
be
insult
;
and
to
whom
?
 
<EOS>
my
own
brother
and
your
nephew
.
<EOS>
nor
do
he
use
me
so
barbarously
 
indeed
,
that
would
have
be
more
inexcusable
than
anything
he
hath
do
.
<EOS>
Fortune
may
tempt
man
of
no
very
bad
disposition
to
injustice
;
but
insult
proceed
only
from
black
and
rancorous
mind
,
and
have
no
temptation
to
excuse
them
.
<EOS>
let
me
beseech
you
,
sir
,
to
do
nothing
by
him
in
the
present
height
of
your
anger
.
<EOS>
consider
,
my
dear
uncle
,
I
be
not
myself
condemn
unheard
.
"
<EOS>
Allworthy
stand
silent
a
moment
,
and
then
,
embrace
Jones
,
he
say
,
with
tear
gush
from
his
eye
,
"
o
my
child
!
<EOS>
to
what
goodness
have
I
be
so
long
blind
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Miller
enter
the
room
at
that
moment
,
after
a
gentle
rap
which
be
not
perceive
,
and
see
Jones
in
the
arm
of
his
uncle
,
the
poor
woman
in
an
agony
of
joy
fall
upon
her
knee
,
and
burst
forth
into
the
most
ecstatic
thanksgiving
to
heaven
for
what
have
happen
;
then
,
run
to
Jones
,
she
embrace
him
eagerly
,
cry
,
"
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
,
I
wish
you
joy
<EOS>
a
thousand
and
a
thousand
time
of
this
bl
day
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
next
Mr
Allworthy
himself
receive
the
same
congratulation
.
<EOS>
to
which
he
answer
,
"
indeed
,
indeed
,
Mrs
Miller
,
I
be
beyond
expression
happy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
some
few
more
rapture
have
pass
on
all
side
,
Mrs
Miller
desire
them
both
to
walk
down
to
dinner
in
the
parlour
,
where
she
say
there
be
a
very
happy
set
of
people
assemble
 
be
indeed
no
other
than
Mr
Nightingale
and
his
bride
,
and
his
cousin
Harriet
with
her
bridegroom
.
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
excuse
himself
from
dine
with
the
company
,
say
he
have
order
some
little
thing
for
him
and
his
nephew
in
his
own
apartment
,
for
that
they
have
much
private
business
to
discourse
of
;
but
would
not
resist
promise
the
good
woman
that
both
he
and
Jones
would
make
part
of
her
society
at
supper
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Miller
then
ask
what
be
to
be
do
with
Blifil
?
"
<EOS>
for
indeed
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
can
not
be
easy
while
such
a
villain
be
in
my
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
Allworthy
answer
,
"
He
be
as
uneasy
as
herself
on
the
same
account
.
"
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
cry
she
,
"
if
that
be
the
case
,
leave
the
matter
to
me
<EOS>
,
I
will
soon
show
him
the
outside
out
of
my
door
,
I
warrant
you
.
<EOS>
here
be
<EOS>
two
or
three
lusty
fellow
below
-
stair
.
"
<EOS>
"
there
will
be
no
need
of
any
violence
,
"
cry
Allworthy
;
"
if
you
will
carry
him
a
message
from
me
,
he
will
,
I
be
convinced
,
depart
of
his
own
accord
.
"
<EOS>
"
Will
I
?
"
say
Mrs
Miller
;
"
I
never
do
anything
in
my
life
with
a
well
will
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
Jones
interfere
,
and
say
,
"
He
have
consider
the
matter
better
,
and
would
,
if
Mr
Allworthy
please
,
be
himself
the
messenger
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
already
enough
of
your
pleasure
,
sir
,
and
I
beg
leave
to
acquaint
him
with
it
by
my
own
word
.
<EOS>
let
me
beseech
you
,
sir
,
"
add
he
,
"
to
reflect
on
the
dreadful
consequence
of
drive
him
to
violent
and
sudden
despair
.
<EOS>
how
unfit
,
alas
!
<EOS>
be
this
poor
man
to
die
in
his
present
situation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
suggestion
have
not
the
least
effect
on
Mrs
Miller
.
<EOS>
She
leave
the
room
,
cry
,
"
You
be
too
good
,
Mr
Jones
,
infinitely
too
good
to
live
in
this
world
.
"
<EOS>
but
it
make
a
deep
impression
on
Allworthy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
good
child
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
be
equally
astonish
at
the
goodness
of
your
heart
,
and
the
quickness
of
your
understanding
.
<EOS>
Heaven
indeed
forbid
that
this
wretch
should
be
deprive
of
any
mean
or
time
for
repentance
!
<EOS>
that
would
be
a
shocking
consideration
indeed
.
<EOS>
go
to
him
,
therefore
,
and
use
your
own
discretion
;
yet
do
not
flatter
him
with
any
hope
of
my
forgiveness
;
for
I
shall
never
forgive
villany
farther
than
my
religion
oblige
me
,
and
that
extend
not
either
to
our
bounty
or
our
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
go
up
to
Blifil
's
room
,
whom
he
find
in
a
situation
which
move
his
pity
,
though
it
would
have
raise
a
less
amiable
passion
in
many
beholder
.
<EOS>
He
cast
himself
on
his
bed
,
where
he
lie
abandon
himself
to
despair
,
and
drown
in
tear
;
not
in
such
tear
as
flow
from
contrition
,
and
wash
away
guilt
from
mind
which
have
be
seduce
or
surprize
into
it
unawares
,
against
the
bent
of
their
natural
disposition
,
as
will
sometimes
happen
from
human
frailty
,
even
to
the
good
;
no
,
these
tear
be
such
as
the
fright
thief
shed
in
his
cart
,
and
be
indeed
the
effect
of
that
concern
which
the
most
savage
nature
be
seldom
deficient
in
feeling
for
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
unpleasant
and
tedious
to
paint
this
scene
in
full
length
.
<EOS>
let
it
suffice
to
say
,
that
the
behaviour
of
Jones
be
kind
to
excess
.
<EOS>
He
omit
nothing
which
his
invention
could
supply
,
to
raise
and
comfort
the
droop
spirit
of
Blifil
,
before
he
communicate
to
him
the
resolution
of
his
uncle
that
he
must
quit
the
house
that
evening
.
<EOS>
He
offer
to
furnish
him
with
any
money
he
want
,
assure
him
of
his
hearty
forgiveness
of
all
he
have
do
against
him
,
that
he
would
endeavour
to
live
with
him
hereafter
as
a
brother
,
and
would
leave
nothing
unattempted
to
effectuate
a
reconciliation
with
his
uncle
.
  
<EOS>
Blifil
be
at
first
sullen
and
silent
,
balance
in
his
mind
whether
he
should
yet
deny
all
;
but
,
find
at
last
the
evidence
too
strong
against
him
,
he
betake
himself
at
last
to
confession
.
<EOS>
He
then
ask
pardon
of
his
brother
in
the
most
vehement
manner
,
prostrate
himself
on
the
ground
,
and
kiss
his
foot
;
in
short
he
be
now
as
remarkably
mean
as
he
have
be
before
remarkably
wicked
.
  
<EOS>
Jones
could
not
so
far
check
his
disdain
,
but
that
it
a
little
discover
itself
in
his
countenance
at
this
extreme
servility
.
<EOS>
He
raise
his
brother
the
moment
he
could
from
the
ground
,
and
advise
him
to
bear
his
affliction
more
like
a
man
;
repeat
,
at
the
same
time
,
his
promise
,
that
he
would
do
all
in
his
power
to
lessen
them
;
<EOS>
for
which
Blifil
,
make
many
profession
of
his
unworthiness
,
pour
forth
a
profusion
of
thank
;
and
then
,
he
have
declare
he
would
immediately
depart
to
another
lodging
,
Jones
return
to
his
uncle
.
  
<EOS>
among
other
matter
,
Allworthy
now
acquaint
Jones
with
the
discovery
which
he
have
make
concern
the
L500
bank
-
note
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
"
say
he
,
"
already
consult
a
lawyer
,
who
tell
me
,
to
my
great
astonishment
,
that
there
be
no
punishment
for
a
fraud
of
this
kind
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
when
I
consider
the
black
ingratitude
of
this
fellow
toward
you
,
I
think
a
highwayman
,
compare
to
him
,
be
an
innocent
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
Heaven
!
<EOS>
"
say
Jones
,
"
be
it
possible
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
shocked
beyond
measure
at
this
news
.
<EOS>
I
think
there
be
not
an
honester
fellow
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
the
temptation
of
such
a
sum
be
too
great
for
him
to
withstand
;
for
small
matter
have
come
safe
to
me
through
his
hand
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
my
dear
uncle
,
you
must
suffer
me
to
call
it
weakness
rather
than
ingratitude
;
for
I
be
convince
the
poor
fellow
love
me
,
and
hath
do
me
some
kindness
,
which
I
can
never
forget
;
<EOS>
nay
,
I
believe
he
hath
repent
of
this
very
act
;
for
it
be
not
above
a
day
or
two
ago
,
when
my
affair
seem
in
the
most
desperate
situation
,
that
he
visit
me
in
my
confinement
,
and
offer
me
any
money
I
want
.
<EOS>
consider
,
sir
,
what
a
temptation
to
a
man
who
hath
taste
such
bitter
distress
,
it
must
be
,
to
have
a
sum
in
his
possession
which
must
put
him
and
his
family
beyond
any
future
possibility
of
suffer
the
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
child
,
"
cry
Allworthy
,
"
you
carry
this
forgiving
temper
too
far
.
<EOS>
such
mistaken
mercy
be
not
only
weakness
,
but
border
on
injustice
,
and
be
very
pernicious
to
society
,
as
it
encourage
vice
.
<EOS>
the
dishonesty
of
this
fellow
I
may
,
perhaps
,
have
pardon
,
but
never
his
ingratitude
.
<EOS>
and
give
me
leave
to
say
,
when
we
suffer
any
temptation
to
atone
for
dishonesty
itself
,
we
be
as
candid
and
merciful
as
we
ought
to
be
;
and
so
far
I
confess
I
have
go
;
for
I
have
often
pity
the
fate
of
a
highwayman
,
when
I
have
be
on
the
grand
jury
;
and
have
more
than
once
apply
to
the
judge
on
the
behalf
of
such
as
have
have
any
mitigate
circumstance
in
their
case
;
but
when
dishonesty
be
attend
with
any
blacker
crime
,
such
as
cruelty
,
murder
,
ingratitude
,
or
the
like
,
compassion
and
forgiveness
then
become
fault
.
<EOS>
I
be
convince
the
fellow
be
a
villain
,
and
he
shall
be
punish
;
at
least
as
far
as
I
can
punish
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
speak
with
so
stern
a
voice
,
that
Jones
do
not
think
proper
to
make
any
reply
;
besides
,
the
hour
appoint
by
Mr
Western
now
draw
so
near
,
that
he
have
barely
time
leave
to
dress
himself
.
<EOS>
here
therefore
end
the
present
dialogue
,
and
Jones
retire
to
another
room
,
where
Partridge
attend
,
accord
to
order
,
with
his
cloath
.
  
<EOS>
partridge
have
scarce
see
his
master
since
the
happy
discovery
.
<EOS>
the
poor
fellow
be
unable
either
to
contain
or
express
his
transport
.
<EOS>
He
behave
like
one
frantic
,
and
make
almost
as
many
mistake
while
he
be
dress
Jones
as
I
have
see
make
by
Harlequin
in
dress
himself
on
the
stage
.
  
<EOS>
His
memory
,
however
,
be
not
in
the
least
deficient
.
<EOS>
He
recollect
now
many
omen
and
presage
of
this
happy
event
,
some
of
which
he
have
remark
at
the
time
,
but
many
more
he
now
remember
;
nor
do
he
omit
the
dream
he
have
dreamt
the
evening
before
his
meeting
with
Jones
;
and
conclude
with
say
,
"
I
always
tell
your
honour
something
bode
in
my
mind
that
you
would
one
time
or
other
have
it
in
your
power
to
make
my
fortune
.
"
<EOS>
Jones
assure
him
that
this
boding
should
as
certainly
be
verify
with
regard
to
him
as
all
the
other
omen
have
be
to
himself
;
which
do
not
a
little
add
to
all
the
rapture
which
the
poor
fellow
have
already
conceive
on
account
of
his
master
.
    
<EOS>
approach
still
near
to
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
Jones
,
be
now
completely
dress
,
attend
his
uncle
to
Mr
Western
's
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
indeed
,
one
of
the
fine
figure
ever
beheld
,
and
his
person
alone
would
have
charm
the
great
part
of
womankind
;
but
we
hope
it
hath
already
appear
in
this
history
that
Nature
,
when
she
form
him
,
do
not
totally
rely
,
as
she
sometimes
doth
,
on
this
merit
only
,
to
recommend
her
work
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
,
who
,
angry
as
she
be
,
be
likewise
set
forth
to
the
good
advantage
,
for
which
I
leave
my
female
reader
to
account
,
appear
so
extremely
beautiful
,
that
even
Allworthy
,
when
he
see
her
,
could
not
forbear
whisper
Western
,
that
he
believe
she
be
the
fine
creature
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
to
which
Western
answer
,
in
a
whisper
,
overhear
by
all
present
,
"
so
much
the
well
for
Tom
;
 
for
d####n
me
if
he
shall
not
ha
the
tousling
her
.
"
<EOS>
Sophia
be
all
over
scarlet
at
these
word
,
while
Tom
's
countenance
be
altogether
as
pale
,
and
he
be
almost
ready
to
sink
from
his
chair
.
  
<EOS>
the
tea
-
table
be
scarce
remove
before
Western
lug
Allworthy
out
of
the
room
,
tell
him
he
have
business
of
consequence
to
impart
,
and
must
speak
to
him
that
instant
in
private
,
before
he
forget
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
lover
be
now
alone
,
and
it
will
,
I
question
not
,
appear
strange
to
many
reader
,
that
those
who
have
so
much
to
say
to
one
another
when
danger
and
difficulty
attend
their
conversation
,
and
who
seem
so
eager
to
rush
into
each
other
's
arm
when
so
many
bar
lay
in
their
way
,
now
that
with
safety
they
be
at
liberty
to
say
or
do
whatever
they
please
,
should
both
remain
for
some
time
silent
and
motionless
;
insomuch
that
a
stranger
of
moderate
sagacity
may
have
well
conclude
they
be
mutually
indifferent
;
but
so
it
be
,
however
strange
it
may
seem
;
<EOS>
both
sit
with
their
eye
cast
downwards
on
the
ground
,
and
for
some
minute
continue
in
perfect
silence
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Jones
during
this
interval
attempt
once
or
twice
to
speak
,
but
be
absolutely
incapable
,
mutter
only
,
or
rather
sigh
out
,
some
break
word
;
when
Sophia
at
length
,
partly
out
of
pity
to
him
,
and
partly
to
turn
the
discourse
from
the
subject
which
she
know
well
enough
he
be
endeavour
to
open
,
say
   
"
<EOS>
sure
,
sir
,
you
be
the
most
fortunate
man
in
the
world
in
this
discovery
.
"
<EOS>
"
and
can
you
really
,
madam
,
think
me
so
fortunate
,
"
say
Jones
,
sigh
,
"
while
I
have
incur
your
displeasure
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
sir
,
"
say
she
,
"
as
to
that
you
best
know
whether
you
have
deserve
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
madam
,
"
answer
he
,
"
you
yourself
be
as
well
apprize
of
all
my
demerit
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Miller
hath
acquaint
you
with
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
o
!
<EOS>
my
Sophia
,
be
I
never
to
hope
for
forgiveness
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Mr
Jones
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
may
almost
depend
on
your
own
justice
,
and
leave
it
to
yourself
to
pass
sentence
on
your
own
conduct
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
alas
!
madam
,
"
answer
he
,
"
it
be
mercy
,
and
not
justice
,
which
I
implore
at
your
hand
.
<EOS>
justice
I
know
must
condemn
me
.
 
<EOS>
yet
not
for
the
letter
I
send
to
Lady
Bellaston
.
<EOS>
of
that
I
most
solemnly
declare
you
have
have
a
true
account
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
insist
much
on
the
security
give
him
by
Nightingale
of
a
fair
pretence
for
break
off
,
if
,
contrary
to
their
expectation
,
her
ladyship
should
have
accept
his
offer
;
but
confest
that
he
have
be
guilty
of
a
great
indiscretion
to
put
such
a
letter
as
that
into
her
power
,
"
which
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
have
dearly
pay
for
,
in
the
effect
it
have
upon
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
,
I
can
not
,
"
say
she
,
"
believe
otherwise
of
that
letter
than
you
would
have
me
.
<EOS>
My
conduct
,
I
think
,
shew
you
clearly
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
there
be
much
in
that
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
Mr
Jones
,
have
I
not
enough
to
resent
?
<EOS>
after
what
past
at
Upton
,
so
soon
to
engage
in
a
new
amour
with
another
woman
,
while
I
fancy
,
and
you
pretend
,
your
heart
be
bleed
for
me
?
<EOS>
indeed
,
you
have
act
strangely
.
<EOS>
Can
I
believe
the
passion
you
have
profest
to
me
to
be
sincere
?
<EOS>
or
,
if
I
can
,
what
happiness
can
I
assure
myself
of
with
a
man
capable
of
so
much
inconstancy
?
"
<EOS>
"
o
!
<EOS>
my
Sophia

he
,
"
do
not
doubt
the
sincerity
of

myself
at

reply

frown

<EOS>
the
delicacy

your
sex

not
conceive
the
grossness

how
little

amour
have

"
I

never

Sophia

very
gravely

refinement
enough

I

learn
it
already

the
first
moment
of
hope
that
my
Sophia
may
be
my

teach
it
me
at
once

all
the
rest

well

you
I

great
satisfaction

the
alteration

I

not

night

it
would
be
barbarous

"
<EOS>
this
offer
be
presently
embrace
by
Allworthy
,
and
Sophia
consent
,
have
first
obtain
a
private
promise
from
her
father
that
he
would
not
mention
a
syllable
concern
her
marriage
.
   
<EOS>
the
last
.
  
<EOS>
in
which
the
history
be
conclude
.
  
<EOS>
Young
Nightingale
have
be
that
afternoon
,
by
appointment
,
to
wait
on
his
father
,
who
receive
him
much
more
kindly
than
he
expect
.
<EOS>
there
likewise
he
meet
his
uncle
,
who
be
return
to
town
in
quest
of
his
new
-
married
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
this
marriage
be
the
lucky
incident
which
could
have
happen
to
the
young
gentleman
;
for
these
brother
live
in
a
constant
state
of
contention
about
the
government
of
their
child
,
both
heartily
despise
the
method
which
each
other
take
.
<EOS>
each
of
them
therefore
now
endeavour
,
as
much
as
he
could
,
to
palliate
the
offence
which
his
own
child
have
commit
,
and
to
aggravate
the
match
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
this
desire
of
triumph
over
his
brother
,
add
to
the
many
argument
which
Allworthy
have
use
,
so
strongly
operated
on
the
old
gentleman
that
he
meet
his
son
with
a
smile
countenance
,
and
actually
agree
to
sup
with
him
that
evening
at
Mrs
Miller
's
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
the
other
,
who
really
love
his
daughter
with
the
most
immoderate
affection
,
there
be
little
difficulty
in
incline
him
to
a
reconciliation
.
<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
inform
by
his
nephew
where
his
daughter
and
her
husband
be
,
than
he
declare
he
would
instantly
go
to
her
.
<EOS>
and
when
he
arrive
there
he
scarce
suffer
her
to
fall
upon
her
knee
before
he
take
her
up
,
and
embrace
her
with
a
tenderness
which
affect
all
who
see
him
;
and
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
be
as
well
reconcile
to
both
her
and
her
husband
<EOS>
as
if
he
have
himself
join
their
hand
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
situation
be
affair
when
Mr
Allworthy
and
his
company
arrive
to
complete
the
happiness
of
Mrs
Miller
,
who
no
sooner
see
Sophia
than
she
guess
everything
that
have
happen
;
and
so
great
be
her
friendship
to
Jones
,
that
it
add
not
a
few
transport
to
those
she
feel
on
the
happiness
of
her
own
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
there
have
not
,
I
believe
,
be
many
instance
of
a
number
of
people
meet
together
,
where
every
one
be
so
perfectly
happy
as
in
this
company
.
<EOS>
amongst
whom
the
father
of
young
Nightingale
enjoy
the
least
perfect
content
;
for
,
notwithstanding
his
affection
for
his
son
,
notwithstanding
the
authority
and
the
argument
of
Allworthy
,
together
with
the
other
motive
mention
before
,
he
could
not
so
entirely
be
satisfied
with
his
son
's
choice
;
and
,
perhaps
,
the
presence
of
Sophia
herself
tend
a
little
to
aggravate
and
heighten
his
concern
,
as
a
thought
now
and
then
suggest
itself
that
his
son
may
have
have
that
lady
,
or
some
other
such
.
<EOS>
not
that
any
of
the
charm
which
adorn
either
the
person
or
mind
of
Sophia
create
the
uneasiness
;
it
be
the
content
of
her
father
's
coffer
which
set
his
heart
a
longing
.
<EOS>
these
be
the
charm
which
he
could
not
bear
to
think
his
son
have
sacrifice
to
the
daughter
of
Mrs
Miller
.
  
<EOS>
the
bride
be
both
very
pretty
woman
;
but
so
totally
be
they
eclipse
by
the
beauty
of
Sophia
,
that
,
have
they
not
be
two
of
the
best
-
temper
girl
in
the
world
,
it
would
have
raise
some
envy
in
their
breast
;
for
neither
of
their
husband
could
long
keep
his
eye
from
Sophia
,
who
sit
at
the
table
like
a
queen
receive
homage
,
or
,
rather
,
like
a
superior
be
receive
adoration
from
all
around
her
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
an
adoration
which
they
give
,
not
which
she
exact
;
for
she
be
as
much
distinguish
by
her
modesty
and
affability
as
by
all
her
other
perfection
.
  
<EOS>
the
evening
be
spend
in
much
true
mirth
.
<EOS>
all
be
happy
,
but
those
the
most
who
have
be
most
unhappy
before
.
<EOS>
Their
former
suffering
and
fear
give
such
a
relish
to
their
felicity
as
even
love
and
fortune
,
in
their
full
flow
,
could
not
have
give
without
the
advantage
of
such
a
comparison
.
<EOS>
yet
,
as
great
joy
,
especially
after
a
sudden
change
and
revolution
of
circumstance
,
be
apt
to
be
silent
,
and
dwell
rather
in
the
heart
than
on
the
tongue
,
Jones
and
Sophia
appear
the
least
merry
of
the
whole
company
;
which
Western
observe
with
great
impatience
,
often
cry
out
to
them
,
"
why
dost
not
talk
,
boy
?
<EOS>
why
dost
look
so
grave
?
<EOS>
hast
lose
thy
tongue
,
girl
?
<EOS>
drink
another
glass
of
wine
;
sha't
drink
another
glass
.
"
<EOS>
and
,
the
more
to
enliven
her
,
he
would
sometimes
sing
a
merry
song
,
which
bear
some
relation
to
matrimony
and
the
loss
of
a
maidenhead
.
<EOS>
nay
,
he
would
have
proceed
so
far
on
that
topic
as
to
have
drive
her
out
of
the
room
,
if
Mr
Allworthy
have
not
checkt
him
,
sometimes
by
look
,
and
once
or
twice
by
a
"
Fie
!
<EOS>
Mr
Western
!
"
<EOS>
He
begin
,
indeed
,
once
to
debate
the
matter
,
and
assert
his
right
to
talk
to
his
own
daughter
as
he
think
fit
;
but
,
as
nobody
second
him
,
he
be
soon
reduce
to
order
.
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
little
restraint
,
he
be
so
pleased
with
the
chearfulness
and
good
-
humour
of
the
company
,
that
he
insist
on
their
meeting
the
next
day
at
his
lodging
.
<EOS>
They
all
do
so
;
and
the
lovely
Sophia
,
who
be
now
in
private
become
a
bride
too
,
officiate
as
the
mistress
of
the
ceremony
,
or
,
in
the
polite
phrase
,
do
the
honour
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
She
have
that
morning
<EOS>
give
her
hand
to
Jones
,
in
the
chapel
at
doctors'-common
,
where
Mr
Allworthy
,
Mr
Western
,
and
Mrs
Miller
,
be
the
only
person
present
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
have
earnestly
desire
her
father
that
no
other
of
the
company
,
who
be
that
day
to
dine
with
him
,
should
be
acquaint
with
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
the
same
secrecy
be
enjoin
to
Mrs
Miller
,
and
Jones
undertake
for
Allworthy
.
<EOS>
this
somewhat
reconcile
the
delicacy
of
Sophia
to
the
public
entertainment
which
,
in
compliance
with
her
father
's
will
,
she
be
oblige
to
go
to
,
greatly
against
her
own
inclination
.
<EOS>
in
confidence
of
this
secrecy
she
go
through
the
day
pretty
well
,
till
the
squire
,
who
be
now
advance
into
the
second
bottle
,
could
contain
his
joy
no
longer
,
but
,
fill
out
a
bumper
,
drank
a
health
to
the
bride
.
<EOS>
the
health
be
immediately
pledge
by
all
present
,
to
the
great
confusion
of
our
poor
blush
Sophia
,
and
the
great
concern
of
Jones
upon
her
account
.
<EOS>
to
say
truth
,
there
be
not
a
person
present
make
wise
by
this
discovery
;
for
Mrs
Miller
have
whisper
it
to
her
daughter
,
her
daughter
to
her
husband
,
her
husband
to
his
sister
,
and
she
to
all
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
now
take
the
first
opportunity
of
withdraw
with
the
lady
,
and
the
squire
sit
in
to
his
cup
,
in
which
he
be
,
by
degree
,
desert
by
all
the
company
except
the
uncle
of
young
Nightingale
,
who
love
his
bottle
as
well
as
western
himself
.
<EOS>
these
two
,
therefore
,
sit
stoutly
to
it
during
the
whole
evening
,
and
long
after
that
happy
hour
which
have
surrender
the
charming
Sophia
to
the
eager
arm
of
her
enraptured
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
reader
,
we
have
at
length
bring
our
history
to
a
conclusion
,
in
which
,
to
our
great
pleasure
,
though
contrary
,
perhaps
,
to
thy
expectation
,
Mr
Jones
appear
to
be
the
happy
of
all
humankind
;
for
what
happiness
this
world

equal
to
the
possession
of
such
a
woman
as
Sophia
,
I
sincerely
own
I
have
never
yet

.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
other
person
who

any
considerable
figure

this
history

<EOS>
He

confidence
of
Allworthy
,
or
to
ingratiate
himself
with
Jones
,
both
of
whom
he
flatter
to
their
face
,
and
abuse
behind
their
back
.
<EOS>
but

a
perfect
stranger

and

with
great

<EOS>
Mr
Nightingale
hath

an
estate

his

the
neighbourhood
of
Jones
,
where
the
young
gentleman
,
his

,
Mrs
Miller
,
and
her
little

and
the
most
agreeable

Mrs

Black

and

the
money
on
his
family
,
but
not
in
equal
proportion
,
for
Molly

much
the
great
share
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Partridge
,
Jones
hath
settle
L50
a
-
year
on
him
;
and
he
hath
again
set
up
a
school

well
encouragement
than
formerly

and
there

between
him
and
Miss
Molly
Seagrim
,
which
,
through
the
mediation
of
Sophia
,
be
likely
to
take
effect
.
  
<EOS>
We
now
return
to
take
leave
of
Mr
Jones
and
Sophia
,
who
,
within
two
day
after
their
marriage
,
attend
Mr
Western
and
Mr
Allworthy
into
the
country
.
<EOS>
western
hath
resign
his
family
seat
,
and
the
great
part
of
his
estate
,
to
his
son
-
in
-
law
,
and
hath
retire
to
a
less
house
of
his
in
another
part
of
the
country
,
which
be
well
for
hunting
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
be
often
as
a
visitant
with
Mr
Jones
,
who
,
as
well
as
his
daughter
,
hath
an
infinite
delight
in
do
everything
in
their
power
to
please
him
.
<EOS>
and
this
desire
of
theirs
be
attend
with
such
success
,
that
the
old
gentleman
declare
he
be
never
happy
in
his
life
till
now
.
<EOS>
He
hath
here
a
parlour
and
ante
-
chamber
to
himself
,
where
he
get
drunk
with
whom
he
please
:
and
his
daughter
be
still
as
ready
as
formerly
to
play
to
him
whenever
he
desire
it
;
for
Jones
hath
assure
her
that
,
as
,
next
to
please
her
,
one
of
his
high
satisfaction
be
to
contribute
to
the
happiness
of
the
old
man
;
so
,
the
great
duty
which
she
express
and
perform
to
her
father
,
render
her
almost
equally
dear
to
him
with
the
love
which
she
bestow
on
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Sophia
hath
already
produce
him
two
fine
child
,
a
boy
and
a
girl
,
of
whom
the
old
gentleman
be
so
fond
,
that
he
spend
much
of
his
time
in
the
nursery
,
where
he
declare
the
tattling
of
his
little
grand
-
daughter
,
who
be
above
a
year
and
a
half
old
,
be
sweet
music
than
the
fine
cry
of
dog
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
Allworthy
be
likewise
greatly
liberal
to
Jones
on
the
marriage
,
and
hath
omit
no
instance
of
shew
his
affection
to
him
and
his
lady
,
who
love
him
as
a
father
.
<EOS>
whatever
in
the
nature
of
Jones
have
a
tendency
to
vice
,
have
be
correct
by
continual
conversation
with
this
good
man
,
and
by
his
union
with
the
lovely
and
virtuous
Sophia
.
<EOS>
He
hath
also
,
by
reflection
on
his
past
folly
,
acquire
a
discretion
and
prudence
very
uncommon
in
one
of
his
lively
part
.
  
<EOS>
to
conclude
,
as
there
be
not
to
be
find
a
worthy
man
and
woman
,
than
this
fond
couple
,
so
neither
can
any
be
imagine
more
happy
.
<EOS>
They
preserve
the
pure
and
tender
affection
for
each
other
,
an
affection
daily
encrease
and
confirm
by
mutual
endearment
and
mutual
esteem
.
<EOS>
nor
be
their
conduct
towards
their
relation
and
friend
less
amiable
than
towards
one
another
.
<EOS>
and
such
be
their
condescension
,
their
indulgence
,
and
their
beneficence
to
those
below
them
,
that
there
be
not
a
neighbour
,
a
tenant
,
or
a
servant
,
who
doth
not
most
gratefully
bless
the
day
when
Mr
Jones
be
marry
to
his
Sophia
.
